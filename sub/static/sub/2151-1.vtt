00:24.760 --> 00:27.923
<i>Mayday, Mayday, this
is Hesper Two-Niner-Niner in distress.</i>

00:28.080 --> 00:29.127
Dad!

00:29.280 --> 00:31.965
Engines 1 and 2 are off-line!
We're losing her!

00:34.360 --> 00:35.407
<i>Go! Go!</i>

00:42.760 --> 00:43.807
Dad!

01:00.520 --> 01:02.249
<i>I've heard stories of Earth.</i>

01:04.360 --> 01:05.805
<i>A paradise.</i>

01:07.040 --> 01:08.644
<i>Until we destroyed it.</i>

01:25.600 --> 01:29.161
<i>The founding of the United
Ranger Corps 1000 years ago</i>

01:29.440 --> 01:33.161
<i>was a global military effort,
an evacuation of Earth.</i>

01:38.880 --> 01:42.123
<i>The Rangers would lead the settlement
of mankind's new home.</i>

01:43.040 --> 01:44.405
<i>Nova Prime.</i>

01:47.600 --> 01:48.931
<i>But we were not alone.</i>

01:56.520 --> 01:58.124
<i>The aliens released the Ursa.</i>

01:59.640 --> 02:02.246
<i>Monsters bred to kill humans.</i>

02:03.120 --> 02:05.361
<i>Technically blind,
the Ursa sees humans</i>

02:05.560 --> 02:08.166
<i>based on pheromones
we secrete when frightened.</i>

02:08.680 --> 02:10.603
<i>They literally smell our fear.</i>

02:11.640 --> 02:14.120
<i>Humankind was again
in danger of extinction</i>

02:14.320 --> 02:17.085
<i>and again turned to the Rangers
for the answer.</i>

02:17.760 --> 02:22.288
<i>That answer came in the form of
the prime commander, Cypher Raige,</i>

02:22.560 --> 02:24.483
<i>the original ghost.</i>

02:24.640 --> 02:27.769
<i>He is believed to be
so completely free of fear</i>

02:27.960 --> 02:30.725
<i>that to an Ursa, he is invisible.</i>

02:30.920 --> 02:34.242
<i>This phenomena is known
as "ghosting."</i>

03:13.360 --> 03:15.089
This isn't a race, cadet!

03:23.960 --> 03:25.450
Raige.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.561
<i>Your test scores are very impressive.</i>

03:31.280 --> 03:35.490
In the classroom,
you are an outstanding Ranger,

03:35.640 --> 03:38.564
but in the field, you collapse.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.571
I'm not advancing you.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.569
You may try again next year.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.641
Sir, I am dedicated, have studied

03:46.800 --> 03:49.406
and display conduct
becoming of a Ranger, sir.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.962
I request that the commander
reconsider his assessment, sir.

03:53.320 --> 03:58.963
Cadet.
Sir, my father's returning home tonight.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.328
I haven't seen him in...

04:03.480 --> 04:05.528
It's a very special day for our family.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.041
And I have got to be able to tell him
that I am a Ranger, sir.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.881
You tell your father

04:16.600 --> 04:18.488
that I said, "Welcome home."

04:19.519 --> 04:21.442
Dismissed.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.964
Faia.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.121
Hi.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.244
How were finals?

05:11.720 --> 05:14.963
How were finals?
I wasn't advanced to Ranger.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.127
Where do we look when we speak?

05:20.640 --> 05:23.484
I was not advanced to Ranger.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.566
You were not advanced to Ranger...

05:28.760 --> 05:32.287
I was not
advanced to Ranger, sir.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.604
That's all right. You're young.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.764
I ran the canyons 11 seconds
faster than you did.

05:47.560 --> 05:52.851
You weren't ready. Velan's a good man.
He knows his stuff.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.681
If you were, he would have promoted you.
You weren't ready.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.282
I'm not hungry.
I'm going to my room.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.284
Are you asking me or telling me?
May I go to my room?

06:03.440 --> 06:05.283
Denied! Sit down!

06:34.840 --> 06:38.242
I have a last visit to Iphitos.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.609
I'm flying tomorrow,
supervising training.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.163
And after it's completed,

06:46.880 --> 06:48.644
I'm announcing my retirement.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.005
Retirement?

06:52.320 --> 06:54.687
Maybe I'll work with you

06:55.160 --> 06:56.730
in Turbine Division.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.250
Together.
Please, no.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.844
I want my family back.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.485
I want you back.

07:12.200 --> 07:16.808
That boy in there
is trying to find you.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.761
He's a feeling boy.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.727
He's an intuitive boy.

07:23.520 --> 07:27.366
He watched you read that book
with Senshi his entire life.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.644
He's reading that book now.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.521
He's reaching for you.

07:35.200 --> 07:39.808
Don't get me wrong. I respect
everything you've done.

07:40.640 --> 07:45.407
But you have a son in the other
room that you do not know.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.730
He blames himself
for what happened to Senshi.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.930
He thinks it's his fault.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.764
He's drowning.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.210
And he does not need
a commanding officer.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.048
He needs a father.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.686
Pack your bags. You're
coming with me to Iphitos.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.564
This was a really good decision.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.683
Now go make some good
memories together.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.963
You take it easy on your father.
He's a little rusty.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.201
Okay.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.604
General Raige.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.688
I was on the plateau.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.531
You saved me and four others.

09:31.720 --> 09:36.169
I just came from seeing
my baby girl's face for the first time.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.446
Stand me up.
That won't be necessary, Ranger.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.205
Stand me up.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.290
Watch the left side!

10:11.560 --> 10:13.164
Pull!

10:13.640 --> 10:15.369
Perimeter's good.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.282
I'm reading <i>Moby Dick.</i>

11:18.760 --> 11:22.481
Your mother told me.
That's great.

11:24.760 --> 11:28.040
<i>Our military transport
will arrive at training base on Iphitos</i>

11:28.200 --> 11:30.168
<i>in seven hours.</i>

11:31.200 --> 11:34.443
I'm going to grab some rack time.
I recommend you do the same.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.927
Hey. Can you read?

12:25.160 --> 12:27.242
I said, can you read?

12:27.760 --> 12:28.807
Yes, sir.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.929
Well, there's a sign back there.

12:31.080 --> 12:35.051
"Authorized personnel only."

12:35.400 --> 12:37.004
Why didn't you read that?

12:39.720 --> 12:41.165
What's in the cage?

12:41.400 --> 12:43.448
Might wanna go easy on him, sarge.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.650
That's the prime commander's son
right there.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.005
You're Raige's kid?

12:52.160 --> 12:54.288
What's in there?

12:59.640 --> 13:01.369
You wanna see?

13:05.200 --> 13:07.362
Kit, we have to go right now.
Is that...?

13:07.520 --> 13:09.887
They surprised us.
Sent ships, dropped those things.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.367
An Ursa?

13:14.560 --> 13:17.450
We're taking it to
Iphitos for ghost training.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.440
You want to see if you can ghost?

13:58.280 --> 14:02.683
<i>Ghosting is when you don't
have a trace of fear in you.</i>

14:18.760 --> 14:20.125
Most guys freeze.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.245
That's your cerebral cortex
looking for an answer it doesn't have.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.609
See? Even your brain knows
you're screwed.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.121
Your blood is filling
with adrenaline now,

14:34.840 --> 14:37.081
whether you know it or not.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.208
Your heart's beating faster.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.602
It's getting a little
harder to breathe.

14:44.520 --> 14:48.764
Your neurobiological system
is telling you to run

14:48.920 --> 14:51.730
but your knees
are too weak to move.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.561
And it's too late anyway.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.849
The pores on your skin
have already opened up,

15:00.640 --> 15:04.929
secreting an imperceptible amount
of pheromones into the air.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.891
And all you can think about
is when it's going to kill you.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.366
Senshi!

15:20.840 --> 15:23.161
She sees you, kid. Heh, heh.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.442
Attention on deck.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.922
Kitai. Back to
your seat, now.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.570
Rangers, go Redcon-1.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.848
Secure all cargo!

15:40.520 --> 15:44.366
Behind your seat, there's a life suit.
Put it on. Strap in, full harness.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.090
Yes, sir.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.809
Good evening, general.
Captain.

15:53.960 --> 15:58.124
What's the last known position
of the closest asteroid storm?

16:00.800 --> 16:03.451
Category-four
asteroid formation.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.446
Two thousand kilometers to starboard
at plus-four-five declination.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.126
I detected graviton vibrations
in the hull.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.845
But you detected how?

16:12.000 --> 16:16.050
Graviton buildup could be a precursor
to mass expansion.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.242
That storm could be on us in minutes.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.563
But, sir, mass expansion
is one in a million.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.040
If we try to navigate out,

16:36.200 --> 16:40.125
the pull of our own graviton weight
could set the thing off.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.884
Let's just hold course
and hope I'm wrong.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.961
Just out of interest, sir,
how often are you wrong?

16:49.760 --> 16:53.242
My wife would give a very interesting
answer to that question.

16:56.800 --> 17:01.840
Graviton count's decreasing.
Eight hundred parts per million.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.446
Six hundred and fifty.

17:05.240 --> 17:09.369
Well, sir, there's a first time
for everything.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.644
Turn into it. Match bearing.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.165
Dad!

17:45.480 --> 17:48.643
She's a dead stick! Engines off-line!
We're losing her!

17:48.800 --> 17:50.882
Can you travel us out of here?
Where?

17:51.040 --> 17:52.963
The anchorage. Lycia. It's closest.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.488
Negative, sir. We cannot
Wormhole travel in the middle of this.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.210
Do it.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.766
Coordinates for anchorage at Lycia
locked in. No confirmation signal.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.490
Travel us now.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.928
Without confirmation...
That's an order.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.242
Go! Go!

18:55.240 --> 18:57.527
Cabin pressure dropping.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.721
Heavy damage to outer hull.
Breach possible in middle cabin.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.724
Find me something I can land on. Now.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.011
I got something.
Bearing three-four-zero

19:19.200 --> 19:21.931
by nine-five,
range 86,000.

19:40.640 --> 19:44.804
<i>Warning. This planet has been
declared unfit for human habitation,</i>

19:44.960 --> 19:48.760
<i>placed under class-one quarantine
by the interplanetary Authority.</i>

19:48.920 --> 19:52.049
<i>Under penalty of law,
do not attempt to land.</i>

19:52.200 --> 19:55.249
<i>Repeat, do not attempt to land.</i>

19:56.120 --> 19:58.521
It's not possible.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.800
The computer might have defaulted
back to a known demarcation point.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.841
No, not here.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.365
Travel us again.

20:10.560 --> 20:13.962
Negative, sir. This ship
is going to tear apart at any moment.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.202
Set her down.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.283
Mayday, Mayday, this is
<i>Hesper Two-Niner-Niner</i> in distress.

20:32.440 --> 20:36.525
We took damage from an asteroid storm
and are going down with bingo power.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.162
Dad, Dad, Dad!

21:05.840 --> 21:07.763
Dad!

24:09.920 --> 24:11.763
You all right?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.570
You stay there.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.124
Evaluate.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.484
Good to go.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.801
Confirm the Ursa is contained.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.088
The back of the ship is gone.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.968
Rangers, count off.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.727
Rangers, count off!

24:40.160 --> 24:41.491
Kit.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.361
The cockpit is directly above us.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.131
Go.

24:58.160 --> 25:01.846
Left rear, there's a utility compartment.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.609
Inside

25:07.960 --> 25:10.804
there's an emergency beacon.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.570
Silver.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.451
Like a saucer. Bring it to me.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.171
Consolidate. Inventory up.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.204
General Cypher Raige.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.283
We crash-landed.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.406
Two confirmed survivors.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.044
Kitai.

26:56.760 --> 27:01.687
The emergency beacon you brought me will
fire a distress signal deep into space.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.444
But it is damaged.

27:03.960 --> 27:07.203
There is another one
in the tail section of our ship.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.562
This is us here.

27:16.440 --> 27:20.729
That is the tail,
somewhere in this area.

27:22.160 --> 27:25.004
It's approximately 100 kilometers
from here.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.331
We need that beacon.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.005
Do you understand?

27:39.840 --> 27:43.287
Both my legs are broken,
one very badly.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.443
You are going to retrieve that beacon

27:47.960 --> 27:50.406
or we are going to die.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.567
Do you understand?

27:56.800 --> 27:58.450
Repeat what I just said to you.

27:59.120 --> 28:02.090
I have to go retrieve the beacon

28:04.800 --> 28:06.370
or we're going to die.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.768
You have air filtration inhalers.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.282
You need to take one now.

28:17.440 --> 28:20.808
The fluid will coat your lungs,
increasing oxygen extraction

28:20.960 --> 28:23.964
allowing you to breathe comfortably
in the environment.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.250
You have six vials.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.085
At your weight, that should be 20 to 24 hours each.
That's more than enough.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.644
Your life suit and backpack

28:36.800 --> 28:39.485
are equipped
with digital and virtual imaging

28:40.080 --> 28:42.970
so I will be able to see
everything that you see

28:43.120 --> 28:44.565
and what you do not see.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.446
I will guide you.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.160
It will be like I'm right there with you.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.048
Take my cutlass.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.562
It's the C-40.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.849
The full 22 configurations.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.365
Kitai,

29:02.880 --> 29:07.488
every single decision you make
will be life or death.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.124
This is a class-one quarantined planet.

29:11.280 --> 29:15.126
Everything on this planet
has evolved to kill humans.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.087
Do you know where we are?

29:20.920 --> 29:22.684
No, sir.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.250
This is Earth.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.804
The Ursa?

29:46.040 --> 29:50.204
Three possibilities. The first and most
likely is that it died in the crash.

29:51.200 --> 29:56.047
The second and less likely is that it is
injured very badly and still contained.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.488
The third and least likely is
that it is out.

30:00.440 --> 30:04.047
We will proceed, however, in
anticipation of the worst-case scenario.

30:04.680 --> 30:09.288
Every movement will be
under protocol Escape and Evade.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.363
If he's out there

30:12.520 --> 30:15.444
I will see him long before
he gets anywhere near you.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.728
Do you understand?

30:18.120 --> 30:19.531
Yes, sir.

30:19.680 --> 30:22.923
Do exactly as I tell you

30:24.160 --> 30:25.366
and we will survive.

31:23.200 --> 31:26.044
<i>Kitai, calm down.</i>

31:26.200 --> 31:27.964
<i>Take a knee.</i>

31:30.840 --> 31:34.970
<i>Root yourself
in this present moment now.</i>

31:35.160 --> 31:38.209
<i>Sight, sound, smell.</i>

31:38.360 --> 31:40.522
<i>What do you feel?</i>

31:41.280 --> 31:42.805
My body feels heavier.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.324
<i>Very good. Earth's gravitational pull
is different than at home.</i>

31:47.480 --> 31:48.970
<i>Very good.</i>

31:49.560 --> 31:51.403
<i>Now let's go.</i>

32:05.720 --> 32:07.324
Whoa, whoa!

32:08.760 --> 32:10.250
What happened?

32:12.120 --> 32:15.841
You didn't see that?
<i>Kitai, what happened?</i>

32:18.880 --> 32:21.963
I'm fine. No change. I just slipped.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.042
<i>There's condensation on the stones.</i>

32:27.200 --> 32:29.168
<i>I'm good to go.</i>

33:25.640 --> 33:28.007
General Cypher Raige.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.891
Initiating remote probe recon.

33:39.920 --> 33:41.126
Primary target,

33:45.960 --> 33:47.849
Ursa.

33:58.520 --> 34:03.321
<i>I want to reiterate that your naviband
is our sole means of communication.</i>

34:03.520 --> 34:04.646
Roger.

34:05.520 --> 34:09.684
The temperatures on this planet
fluctuate dangerously, Kitai.

34:09.840 --> 34:13.639
And most of the planet
freezes over completely at night.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.801
But there are hot spots,

34:16.960 --> 34:19.485
geothermal nodes
between here and the tail

34:19.639 --> 34:22.405
that will keep you warm
during the freeze-over.

34:23.400 --> 34:26.643
You must reach one
of these hot spots

34:26.800 --> 34:30.964
each evening before nightfall.
Is that understood?

34:31.120 --> 34:32.531
<i>Copy.</i>

34:34.000 --> 34:38.050
Standard operating procedure until
I give you further instructions. Stand by.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.769
<i>Dad, are you there?</i>

35:29.720 --> 35:31.529
<i>Hey, Dad, are you there?</i>

35:33.560 --> 35:35.005
Dad,

35:35.520 --> 35:36.567
you there?

35:37.960 --> 35:40.327
<i>Hello?</i>

35:40.720 --> 35:41.767
I'm here.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.242
<i>A boy I know had this.</i>

35:46.720 --> 35:48.165
Mm.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.928
It's a real book. From a museum.

35:52.360 --> 35:55.603
It's <i>Moby Dick.</i>
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

35:56.920 --> 35:58.888
He said I could even hold on to it.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.447
Hold on to what?

36:04.080 --> 36:06.560
The book, Dad. Heh.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.170
Oh.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.526
Hm.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.128
Did they really kill these whales?

36:16.000 --> 36:19.288
We, Senshi, for their oil,

36:19.440 --> 36:21.283
and they almost disappeared.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.363
Just before the age of carbon fuels.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.602
<i>Where's your brother?</i>

36:25.760 --> 36:27.205
Kit.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.485
<i>Hey.</i>

36:32.440 --> 36:34.283
<i>Dad, are you there?</i>

36:41.640 --> 36:42.721
I'm here.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.447
Where are you?

37:57.440 --> 38:01.365
My suit's turned black.
I like it, but I think it's something bad.

38:01.520 --> 38:05.730
Your suit is made of smart fabric.
It has motion sensors.

38:05.880 --> 38:09.043
I'm tracking a life form
moving toward you from the west.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.326
<i>It's closing rapidly.</i>

38:11.040 --> 38:12.610
Fifty meters.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.211
Forty.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.964
<i>Thirty.</i>

38:18.560 --> 38:20.210
<i>Twenty.</i>

38:21.040 --> 38:22.610
Ten.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.050
It is right there, Kitai.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.969
Do not move.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.008
Recognize your power.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.242
This will be your creation.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.363
Stand down, cadet.

38:51.760 --> 38:52.807
Get out of here!

38:53.000 --> 38:54.286
Kitai!

38:55.920 --> 38:57.684
Control yourself, cadet!

39:11.480 --> 39:14.245
<i>Kitai, stand down!</i>

39:14.400 --> 39:15.765
Get away!

39:17.440 --> 39:18.521
Get away!

39:18.720 --> 39:20.245
Kitai!

39:22.960 --> 39:25.645
<i>To your rear. Out to your rear.</i>

39:29.600 --> 39:32.843
There's a river
250 meters straight ahead. Go.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.842
<i>They are no longer in pursuit.</i>

40:35.000 --> 40:37.241
<i>Cadet, you are not being followed.</i>

40:37.400 --> 40:41.041
<i>I repeat, you are not being followed.</i>

40:41.200 --> 40:44.443
<i>Kitai, you are running from nothing'.!</i>

40:45.640 --> 40:47.369
<i>Kitai!</i>

40:53.520 --> 40:54.885
<i>Kitai.</i>

40:55.040 --> 40:56.451
<i>Put my damn cutlass away.</i>

40:56.640 --> 40:59.803
<i>You are not being followed.
Take a knee.</i>

41:01.400 --> 41:03.721
<i>Take a knee, cadet!</i>

41:08.960 --> 41:12.885
If you want to die today that is fine,
but you are not going to kill me.

41:21.560 --> 41:24.245
Kitai, I need you
to do a physical assessment.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.290
You are showing rapid
blood contamination. Are you out?

41:28.600 --> 41:32.844
I'm dizzy.
<i>Kitai, self-eval.</i>

41:52.080 --> 41:55.368
Dad, I can't stand.
<i>Open your med kit.</i>

41:55.520 --> 41:59.286
You are going to have to administer
the antitoxin in sequence.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.761
Inject yourself with the
clear liquid first.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.371
<i>Do it now.</i>

42:10.480 --> 42:11.606
I can't see.

42:11.760 --> 42:15.970
<i>The poison is affecting
your nervous system. Stay even.</i>

42:16.240 --> 42:19.005
Dad, please come help me. I can't see.

42:19.400 --> 42:22.085
I can't do this by myself, Dad.
Please come get me.

42:22.240 --> 42:26.689
Kitai, inject yourself directly
into your heart with the first stage.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.490
<i>Do it now.</i>

42:42.800 --> 42:44.723
Now the second. ASAP.

42:50.760 --> 42:52.285
To your left, Kitai.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.727
<i>Left!</i>
I can't feel my hand.

42:54.920 --> 42:56.922
<i>Dad, I can't feel my hands.</i>

42:57.080 --> 42:59.003
Press it into the ground.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.811
Roll over on it
and press it into the ground, Kitai.

43:23.560 --> 43:25.722
Great work, cadet.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.523
But you are going to have to lie there
for a moment.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.889
The parasite that stung you

43:42.720 --> 43:45.883
has a paralyzing agent in its venom.

43:47.120 --> 43:51.444
<i>So you are going to have to lie there
for a little bit</i>

43:52.680 --> 43:55.684
<i>while the antitoxin does its job.</i>

44:11.720 --> 44:13.927
<i>It's time to wake up.</i>

44:15.520 --> 44:17.010
<i>Son.</i>

44:17.160 --> 44:21.245
<i>The temperature is dropping
five degrees every 10 minutes.</i>

44:21.400 --> 44:23.448
<i>You have got to wake up.</i>

44:26.200 --> 44:28.328
Can you blink your eyes?

44:34.080 --> 44:35.570
Son.

44:36.640 --> 44:40.850
I need you to please blink your eyes.

44:58.440 --> 45:00.442
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

45:00.800 --> 45:02.290
Hey.

45:05.880 --> 45:09.248
<i>That sucked.</i>
That is correct.

45:10.360 --> 45:13.569
You've got 9.7 kilometers
to the hot spot.

45:13.720 --> 45:17.486
How about you show me that 1 OK
in 50 minutes, cadet?

45:17.960 --> 45:19.007
<i>Sir, yes, sir.</i>

45:26.600 --> 45:28.967
Ten mikes out. All good.

45:59.560 --> 46:01.767
Who wasn't advanced to Ranger?
Who was it?

46:01.960 --> 46:03.962
Watch him go. Watch him go.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.362
<i>Five mikes out.</i>

46:10.720 --> 46:12.404
<i>Five mikes out.</i>

46:12.720 --> 46:14.404
<i>Happy 19th birthday, Senshi.</i>

46:14.560 --> 46:15.766
<i>Here.</i>

46:18.720 --> 46:20.688
<i>Dad, you help me.</i>

46:21.200 --> 46:24.522
No, Senshi, you go ahead.
You blow.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.043
<i>Come on, Dad. Blow.</i>

46:27.360 --> 46:30.648
Now, you know there's no way
I can actually do that from here.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.441
No. I think you can. Heh.

46:35.840 --> 46:38.366
Faia, you're right there. Help the girl.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.448
You can do it.

46:43.400 --> 46:45.050
I know you can.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.561
Hot Spot 1 arrival.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.322
H plus 54 minutes.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.249
Equipment check and consolidate.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.489
Take your next inhaler.

47:35.560 --> 47:39.451
Your oxygen extraction is bottoming.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.966
Take your next breathing fluid.

48:00.640 --> 48:02.847
<i>Second dose of breathing fluid
compete.</i>

48:03.000 --> 48:04.525
Mm.

48:06.320 --> 48:08.482
Count off remaining.

48:11.640 --> 48:13.847
<i>Four vials remain, sir.</i>

48:19.360 --> 48:21.089
Repeat.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.249
Four vials remain, sir.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.685
Dad.

48:52.480 --> 48:53.527
Dad!

48:57.120 --> 48:58.690
I'm here.

49:01.040 --> 49:02.724
How did you do it?

49:04.480 --> 49:06.642
How did you first ghost?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.082
Out for a run.

49:11.480 --> 49:13.130
Alone.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.890
Something we're never
supposed to do.

49:18.360 --> 49:22.729
Ursa de-camos right in front of me.

49:23.880 --> 49:26.247
I go for my cutlass.

49:27.440 --> 49:29.681
It shoots its pincer

49:29.840 --> 49:32.207
right through my shoulder.

49:33.640 --> 49:38.009
Next thing I know,
we're over the cliff, falling,

49:39.560 --> 49:44.566
30 meters straight down
into the river.

49:47.560 --> 49:51.007
We settle onto the bottom.

49:52.360 --> 49:54.408
It's on top of me.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.847
But it's not moving.

50:02.080 --> 50:04.208
And I realize

50:06.480 --> 50:08.050
He's trying to drown me.

50:11.760 --> 50:14.240
<i>I'm thinking, "I'm gonna die."</i>

50:15.600 --> 50:17.682
<i>"I'm gonna die."</i>

50:18.880 --> 50:22.248
<i>"I cannot believe
this is how I'm going to die."</i>

50:25.440 --> 50:30.287
I can see my blood bubbling up,
mixing with the sunlight

50:30.560 --> 50:32.927
shining through the water.

50:36.120 --> 50:38.487
And I think, "Wow...

50:41.000 --> 50:42.764
that's really pretty."

50:46.000 --> 50:48.651
<i>And everything slows down.</i>

50:52.680 --> 50:55.923
And I see its pincer
through my shoulder.

50:58.960 --> 51:00.962
And I decide

51:01.520 --> 51:04.649
I don't want that in there anymore.

51:05.920 --> 51:08.002
So I pull it out.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.128
And he lets me go.

51:14.600 --> 51:17.171
And more than that, I can tell...

51:18.320 --> 51:20.129
it can't find me.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.810
<i>It doesn't even know where to look.</i>

51:28.680 --> 51:30.523
<i>And it dawned on me...</i>

51:33.200 --> 51:38.127
fear is not real.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.685
The only place that fear can exist

51:42.840 --> 51:46.447
is in our thoughts of the future.

51:46.840 --> 51:50.162
It is a product of our imagination,

51:50.320 --> 51:53.642
causing us to fear things
that do not at present

51:53.800 --> 51:56.724
and may not ever exist.

51:58.680 --> 52:01.729
<i>That is near insanity, Kitai.</i>

52:01.880 --> 52:03.882
<i>Now, do not misunderstand me.</i>

52:04.040 --> 52:06.691
<i>Danger is very real.</i>

52:07.040 --> 52:09.611
But fear is a choice.

52:14.520 --> 52:17.808
We are all telling ourselves a story.

52:18.680 --> 52:21.570
And that day, mine changed.

52:36.840 --> 52:39.923
<i>Fourteen kilometers to the falls.</i>

52:40.080 --> 52:42.082
<i>That's our midway checkpoint.</i>

52:42.240 --> 52:43.890
I'm reading you.

52:58.440 --> 53:02.764
<i>Kitai, get to the falls ASAP.</i>

53:24.720 --> 53:28.122
I hear something.
I think it's water. A lot of it.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.682
<i>Inventory up.</i>

54:21.640 --> 54:22.846
Roger.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.731
Food rations, half available. Flares, full.

54:25.880 --> 54:29.566
Med kit, half available. Breathing fluid...

54:31.640 --> 54:34.644
Breathing fluid, four vials available.

54:40.560 --> 54:43.086
Why are you not showing me
the case?

54:43.240 --> 54:44.571
What?

54:46.240 --> 54:48.402
<i>Show it to me now.</i>

55:06.720 --> 55:09.041
I thought that I could make it, sir.

55:58.280 --> 56:00.282
Abort mission.

56:01.760 --> 56:02.807
Return to the ship.

56:04.120 --> 56:06.122
<i>That is an order.</i>

56:06.960 --> 56:08.689
Don't come out.

56:08.960 --> 56:10.610
No matter what.

56:11.200 --> 56:12.247
That's an order.

56:19.200 --> 56:20.611
Dad!

56:22.520 --> 56:23.726
Ah!

56:27.960 --> 56:29.564
No, Dad.

56:30.080 --> 56:33.641
I can do it. I don't need many.
I can get across with just two.

56:33.920 --> 56:38.289
You need a minimum of three inhalers
to make it to the tail.

56:38.440 --> 56:40.727
You have exhausted your resources.

56:40.920 --> 56:43.526
I can get across.
I can do it with just two, Dad.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.531
This mission has reached
abort criteria.

56:47.280 --> 56:49.647
<i>I take full responsibility.</i>

56:50.000 --> 56:51.206
<i>You did your best.</i>

56:51.480 --> 56:55.371
You have nothing more to prove.
Now return to the ship.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.170
<i>What was your mistake?</i>

56:59.720 --> 57:01.802
Trusting me?

57:01.960 --> 57:04.850
Depending on me,
thinking that I could do this?

57:05.000 --> 57:07.685
I am giving you an order...

57:09.040 --> 57:11.042
to turn around...

57:11.680 --> 57:13.728
and return to this ship.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.567
You wouldn't give any other Ranger
that order!

57:18.840 --> 57:20.763
You are not a Ranger.

57:22.080 --> 57:24.811
And I am giving you that order.

57:35.480 --> 57:38.051
What was I supposed to do?

57:39.360 --> 57:41.966
What did you want me to do?

57:42.880 --> 57:44.530
She gave me an order!

57:44.680 --> 57:48.048
She said no matter what,
don't come out of that box!

57:50.120 --> 57:52.600
Was I supposed to just come out
and die?

57:53.240 --> 57:55.481
What do you think, cadet?

57:56.720 --> 57:58.768
What do you think
you should have done?

57:58.920 --> 58:00.729
Because that is all that matters.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.882
What do you think
you should have done?

58:06.760 --> 58:08.444
And where were you?!

58:08.600 --> 58:10.967
She called out for you!
She called your name!

58:11.120 --> 58:14.044
And you weren't there,
because you're never there!

58:15.200 --> 58:17.601
And you think I'm a coward?!

58:20.400 --> 58:22.243
You're wrong!

58:22.400 --> 58:24.801
I'm not a coward!

58:25.040 --> 58:27.088
You're the coward!

58:29.240 --> 58:31.527
I'm not a coward!

58:32.880 --> 58:34.211
Kitai!

58:48.240 --> 58:49.730
Kitai, you've got incoming.

58:51.480 --> 58:53.801
Do you copy? You've got incoming.

59:09.640 --> 59:11.642
Kitai, dive!

59:12.040 --> 59:13.246
Dive!

59:38.200 --> 59:39.690
<i>Kitai!</i>

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.405
No!

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.211
Leave them alone!

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.570
Get away!

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.850
Dad, I'm sorry. It's Kitai.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.927
Where is my son?

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.606
General Cypher Raige.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.931
This is a message for my wife.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.769
Faia...

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.203
I have lost contact with our son.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.482
End message.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.240
<i>You have six vials. At your weight,
that should be 20 to 24 hours each.</i>

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.010
<i>That's more than enough.</i>

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.526
<i>I estimate four days to reach the tail.
Let's break it into sections.</i>

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.331
<i>Six hours to reach
the first geothermal site.</i>

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.166
<i>The first leg, 20 K to the mouth
of the North Forest. I'm right here.</i>

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.004
<i>- Five mikes out.</i>
<i>- Keep moving.</i>

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.010
<i>- Hot Spot 1 arrival.</i>
<i>- Take your next inhaler.</i>

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.162
<i>H plus 54 minutes.</i>

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.403
<i>There is an escarpment.
Looks like it could be a waterfall.</i>

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.007
<i>We'll call that midway.
I can get across. I can do it with two.</i>

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.243
<i>Fourteen kilometers to the falls.
This is us here.</i>

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.329
<i>That is the tail.</i>

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.404
<i>You are going to retrieve
that beacon</i>

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.121
<i>or we are going to die.</i>

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.408
Leave me alone!

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.251
Wake up.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.887
It's time for you to wake up.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.840
Hey.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.205
Hey.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.004
I was just about to come out that day.

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:24.328
No, you weren't.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.042
But you did the right thing.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.367
Dad says I should have tried.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.049
He's just mad at himself.
That's all.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.323
Why couldn't you ghost?

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.926
You're close right now.
I am?

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.644
Are you scared?

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.928
No. I'm tired.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.243
That's good.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:08.607
You filled your heart
with something else.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.448
Now you got to get up.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.126
I memorized some of <i>Moby Dick.</i>
Kitai, get up.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:17.647
"All that maddens and torments,
Wake up."

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.046
"All that stirs up lees of things,
Wake up."

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.090
"All truth with malice,
all that cracks the sinews..."

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.526
Wake up!

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.929
Kit...

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.085
Hey, thanks.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.610
No.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.125
Mm-mm.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.049
<i>Dad.</i>

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:20.802
<i>Dad, it's Kitai. I made it to...</i>

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.606
Kitai.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.161
<i>Dad, I made it to the tail. Do you copy?</i>

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.242
Kitai, I'm here.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:37.002
Are you okay?
<i>Dad, do you read me?</i>

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.049
I copy.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.445
<i>Dad, I made it to the tail. Do you copy?</i>

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.444
Kitai, we have electrical interference.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.683
You are in a black zone.
I repeat, you are in a black...

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:57.687
Dad, the Ursa is not contained.
Please copy.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.607
Dad?

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:13.884
I'm here.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.442
I swear to you I'm here.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.371
Take a knee.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.966
It is the ionic layer...

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.491
in the atmosphere
above your current position.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:27.202
It is causing electrical interference.
That is why the beacon is not firing.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.129
To your north.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:41.686
The peak.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.045
You must fire the beacon
from the peak of that mountain.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.811
See it, Kitai.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.328
Please...

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.570
see it.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:19.692
Good boy.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.440
It is a pheromone trigger.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.406
He set it to scare you,

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:53.328
so he can track you. Keep moving.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.609
It has found you.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.565
Run.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.721
Just run, Kitai.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.081
Just run.

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.682
Ah! Unh!

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.930
Unh! Ah!

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.851
Unh!

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.441
Ah!

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.370
Ah! Unh!

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:52.607
Climb in here, okay?
It won't be able to smell you.

01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.921
Dad!

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.689
<i>Root yourself in
this present moment now.</i>

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:27.202
<i>Sight, sound, smell.</i>

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.601
<i>What do you feel?</i>

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.448
You're still in that box.
It's time to come out.

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.686
Yah!

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.686
Yah!

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.004
- Stand me up.
- General.

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:42.886
I said, stand me up.

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.084
Watch his back.

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.727
Dad?

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.570
Yeah?

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:30.001
I want to work with Mom.

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:35.166
Me too.
