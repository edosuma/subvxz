WEBVTT

00:04.590 --> 00:06.410
The problem appears to be unsolvable.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.520
Maybe we could run some
computer simulations.

00:08.530 --> 00:11.040
There are too many variables.
It would take forever.

00:11.050 --> 00:13.560
We've got to be missing something.

00:13.570 --> 00:15.000
Let's start again.

00:15.020 --> 00:21.650
The movie is playing here at 7:20, here
at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.

00:21.670 --> 00:24.520
- These theaters have to be eliminated.
- Why?

00:24.530 --> 00:27.380
They're state-of-the-art digital
projection, 20-channel surround sound.

00:27.390 --> 00:30.650
Yes, but they have no Icee machines.

00:31.170 --> 00:34.930
Despite my aggressive
letter-writing campaign, I might add.

00:34.950 --> 00:37.710
What about the multiplex
here? The seats are terrific.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.710
They have Twizzlers
instead of Red Vines.

00:39.730 --> 00:43.270
No amount of lumbar support
can compensate for that.

00:43.790 --> 00:45.650
Well, it's gonna take
at least an hour to eat,

00:45.690 --> 00:50.080
and I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant
proximate to a Sheldon-approved theater.

00:50.090 --> 00:52.740
- We could eat after the movie.
- Unacceptable.

00:52.750 --> 00:56.530
The delay would result in tomorrow
morning's bowel movement occurring at work.

00:57.770 --> 01:00.850
Hang on, hang on.
There's a 7-Eleven here.

01:00.860 --> 01:04.690
We smuggle Srpies, which are
essentially Icees, in under our coats,

01:04.720 --> 01:09.010
after having a pleasant meal
either here, here or here.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.050
I don't see how we missed that.

01:12.080 --> 01:16.190
Excuse me, in what
universe are Slurpies Icees?

01:17.930 --> 01:20.220
That's how we missed it.

01:20.250 --> 01:22.840
Sheldon, would you be prepared,
on a non-precedential basis,

01:22.870 --> 01:26.000
to create an emergency ad
hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?

01:26.030 --> 01:29.790
Oh, Leonard, you know I can't do that.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.880
Okay, I guess we only have one option.

01:32.910 --> 01:35.280
Yep, I don't see any way around it.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.720
- Bye, Sheldon.
- See ya.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.390
Stay loose.

01:44.510 --> 01:46.960
They're right, it was the only option.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.110
Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.110
- Why?
- Just do it!

02:22.550 --> 02:26.390
- Get inside and shut the door.
- Well, you didn't specify.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.000
Is Leonard around?

02:30.020 --> 02:31.980
He went to the movies without me.

02:31.990 --> 02:34.440
It was the only option.

02:42.590 --> 02:46.160
I'm sorry, I don't understand
which social situation this is.

02:46.170 --> 02:48.630
Could you give me some
guidance as to how to proceed?

02:48.660 --> 02:52.950
The building manager's showing an apartment
downstairs, and I haven't paid my rent.

02:52.990 --> 02:55.570
Oh, I see.

02:55.590 --> 03:00.960
Penny, I'm not sure I'm comfortable harboring a
fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.

03:01.190 --> 03:03.730
It's no big deal.I'm just
a little behind on my bills

03:03.740 --> 03:06.990
because they cut back my hours at
the restaurant and my car broke down.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.900
If you recall, I pointed out the "check
engine" light to you several months ago.

03:12.510 --> 03:16.680
The "check engine" light is
fine. It's still blinking away.

03:17.420 --> 03:20.760
It's the stupid engine
that stopped working.

03:21.010 --> 03:24.200
It cost me like $1,200 to fix it.

03:24.230 --> 03:28.970
You know, it occurs to me you could solve
all your problems by obtaining more money.

03:32.210 --> 03:35.460
Yes, it occurs to me, too.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.790
Hang on a moment.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:47.400 --> 03:51.040
Here. Take some. Pay
me back when you can.

03:51.050 --> 03:53.130
Wow, you got a lot of money in there.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.770
That's why it's guarded by snakes.

03:58.090 --> 03:59.860
- Take some.
- Don't be silly.

03:59.870 --> 04:02.110
I'm never silly.

04:03.390 --> 04:05.420
- Here.
- No, I can't.

04:05.430 --> 04:06.620
Don't you need money?

04:06.640 --> 04:08.920
- Well, yeah, but...
- This is money I'm not using.

04:08.930 --> 04:10.640
But what if you need it?

04:10.670 --> 04:14.430
My expenses account for 46.
9% of my after-tax income.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.200
The rest is divvied up between
a small savings account,

04:17.220 --> 04:19.430
this deceptive container
of peanut brittle

04:19.440 --> 04:22.780
and the hollowed-out buttocks
of a superhero action figure

04:22.790 --> 04:26.130
who shall remain nameless
for his own protection.

04:28.260 --> 04:31.720
Or her own protection.

04:34.330 --> 04:36.980
- Take some.
- Really? I mean, are you sure?

04:36.990 --> 04:40.760
I see no large upcoming expenditures
unless they develop an affordable technology

04:40.770 --> 04:44.290
to fuse my skeleton with
adamantium like Wolverine.

04:45.690 --> 04:48.090
Are th working on that?

04:48.120 --> 04:50.530
I sincerely hope so.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.460
Okay. Well, thank you.

05:18.910 --> 05:20.320
Oh, no, I can't.

05:20.350 --> 05:22.990
Sheldon honey, I don't want
things to be weird between us.

05:23.010 --> 05:27.080
Won't it also be weird if I have to say
hello to you every morning on my way to work

05:27.090 --> 05:30.990
and you're living in a refrigerator box
and washing your hair with rain water?

05:32.530 --> 05:34.670
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.500
Of course you will.

05:36.510 --> 05:39.640
It's impossible to pay me
back sooner than you can.

05:39.890 --> 05:44.040
Assuming you subscribe to a linear
understanding of time and causality.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.130
I'm regretting this already.

05:51.410 --> 05:53.150
You know, I've given
the matter some thought,

05:53.200 --> 05:58.610
and I think I'd be willing to be a house
pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.

06:00.930 --> 06:02.820
Interesting.

06:02.850 --> 06:04.920
Ask me why.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.060
Do I have to?

06:07.090 --> 06:09.840
Of course. That's how you
move a conversation forward.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.910
Why?

06:11.950 --> 06:14.400
The learning opportunities
would be abundant.

06:14.430 --> 06:18.450
Additionally, I like
having my belly scratched.

06:20.620 --> 06:21.840
Hey, Penny. How was work?

06:21.850 --> 06:26.480
Grt. I hope I'm a waitress at the
Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.990
Was that sarcasm?

06:29.010 --> 06:30.160
No.

06:30.180 --> 06:31.890
Was that sarcasm?

06:31.900 --> 06:33.510
Yes.

06:33.530 --> 06:35.980
- Was that
sar-- - Stop it!

06:37.250 --> 06:40.160
Penny, you appear to
have a package here.

06:40.180 --> 06:42.830
Oh, thanks. This must
be the beret I ordered.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.620
A couple of months ago.
It was back-ordered.

06:46.070 --> 06:52.020
Did you know the beret is an example of piece of
women's fashion adapted from male military uniforms?

06:52.030 --> 06:55.950
Another fascinating
example is the epaulet.

06:57.410 --> 07:00.660
He's not lying. He does
find that fascinating.

07:01.420 --> 07:02.720
Okay, whatever.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.860
It's not like I'm running up and down
the streets just buying myself berets.

07:05.870 --> 07:08.160
I bought one, like, a month
ago, and it was back-ordered.

07:08.170 --> 07:10.120
Look, it finally arrived, all right?

07:10.150 --> 07:13.570
- All right.
- Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?

07:16.520 --> 07:17.370
Weird.

07:17.390 --> 07:21.670
Oh, good, that was an unusual
interaction. I wasn't sure.

07:22.820 --> 07:24.130
Did you guys have an argument?

07:24.150 --> 07:25.300
No.

07:25.370 --> 07:28.690
Well, you clearly did
something to aggravate her.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.200
I'm at a loss.

07:30.220 --> 07:34.270
If you like, you can review my
daily log of social interactions

07:34.280 --> 07:37.100
and see if there's a
blunder I overlooked.

07:38.780 --> 07:39.930
Here you go.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.580
Oh, you owe me another two dollars.
The price of moo shu pork went up.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.710
It's getting tougher and
tougher to be a bad Jew.

07:49.220 --> 07:51.310
Here you go, Penny.
Shrimp with lobster sauce.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.940
Thank you, Leonard. What's my share?

07:53.230 --> 07:54.550
Don't worry about it. It's my treat.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.890
- No, really, how much?
- It's... hatever. $10, $11.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.690
Well, which is it, $10 or $11?

07:59.710 --> 08:02.070
14.50 But it's no biggie.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.890
You'll get the next one.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.980
What?

08:09.020 --> 08:12.620
He was just wondering if he wo
skintight jeans and a tank top

08:12.630 --> 08:15.910
if he'd get his shrimp lo mein for free.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.480
What are you saying?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.400
That I'm using my body to get dinner?

08:20.420 --> 08:23.580
That I'm some kind of
Chinese food prostitute?

08:25.650 --> 08:28.280
Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?

08:28.310 --> 08:29.490
'Cause let me tell you something, buddy.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.020
I pay my own way in this world, okay?

08:31.040 --> 08:33.590
I don't rely on anybody!

08:39.039 --> 08:39.990
What was that about?

08:40.030 --> 08:43.690
He has a nervous bladder
when he's stressed out.

08:44.710 --> 08:47.610
Kind of like a puppy.

08:48.760 --> 08:52.480
Here, Leonard--
$10, $11, $12...

08:52.940 --> 08:56.080
It was $14. 50, but it's okay.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.030
Oh, good. Dinner's here.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.730
Yes, dinner's here, and I'm having
some. I'm having takeout food.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.350
- Okay.
- You're damn right it's okay.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.660
I've been having leftovers at
the restaurant for like four days,

09:04.670 --> 09:06.470
and I wanted something
different. So sue me.

09:06.480 --> 09:11.220
Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the
very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.150
Sheldon, look, I will pay
you back as soon as I can.

09:14.180 --> 09:15.470
You just have to give me more time.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.200
Oh, wait, you lent her money?

09:17.220 --> 09:18.660
She needed money.

09:18.690 --> 09:21.840
You seem under pressure. Did I
not lend you a sufficient amount?

09:21.850 --> 09:23.290
Because I n give you more.

09:23.320 --> 09:28.580
Oh, you know, you would just
love that, wouldn't you? Yeah.

09:29.220 --> 09:32.010
You would just love to open
up your little snake can

09:32.020 --> 09:35.880
and throw some money at the
girl who can't pay her bills.

09:36.820 --> 09:37.600
Where are you going?

09:37.630 --> 09:41.100
Going home, where I won't be
interrogated like a criminal.

09:46.350 --> 09:49.260
I forgot my fortune cookie.

09:52.670 --> 09:54.880
In case either of you
have larceny in your heart,

09:54.930 --> 09:58.310
you should know that I've moved
my money out of the snake can.

10:01.580 --> 10:05.850
But if you're ever short, there's always
a couple of 50s in Green Lantern's ass.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.920
A little mood lighting, huh?

10:18.930 --> 10:20.810
Yeah.When I didn't pay my bill,

10:20.820 --> 10:24.880
the Department of Water and Power
thought I would enjoy the ambience.

10:25.810 --> 10:28.680
Yeah, they're very considerate that way.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.510
I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent.

10:30.540 --> 10:34.010
Then I had like $14 left over.

10:34.350 --> 10:37.090
$14, huh?

10:37.100 --> 10:40.450
Put it back in your pocket, or I'll
find some other place to put it.

10:41.610 --> 10:44.370
Back in the pocket it goes.

10:44.380 --> 10:48.040
Look, you do understd that Sheldon really
doesn't care when he gets the money back.

10:48.070 --> 10:52.970
It's actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that
doesn't make you want to, you know, kill him.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.150
Yeah, well, that's not
really my big problem.

10:56.180 --> 10:59.590
So you're a little behind on your bills.
Everybody gets behind on their bills.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.500
Yeah, I know, it's just...
this wasn't the plan.

11:02.510 --> 11:04.280
It wasn't supposed to go this way.

11:04.310 --> 11:06.540
Well, what was the plan?

11:06.570 --> 11:10.330
Um, waitress for six months
and then become a movie star.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.460
Was there a plan B?

11:14.490 --> 11:16.570
TV star.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.860
It's probably not as bad as
you think. Let's take a look.

11:20.870 --> 11:23.700
Maybe we can find some corners to cut.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.140
Oh, here's something.

11:25.180 --> 11:28.660
If you don't have electricity,
then you probably don't need cable.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.740
Just a suggestion.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.350
$170 dollars for acting classes?

11:37.380 --> 11:39.200
Oh, no, I can't give
up my acting classes.

11:39.230 --> 11:41.380
I'm a professional actress.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.310
You've had an acting
job where you got paid?

11:44.330 --> 11:47.790
That is not the
definition of professional.

11:51.050 --> 11:54.310
Actually, it kind of...
Let's keep looking.

11:55.840 --> 12:01.070
Whoa, what's $1,800 to the Los
Angeles County Superior Court?

12:01.090 --> 12:02.890
Oh, that's nothing.

12:02.920 --> 12:08.780
Nothing? It sounds like you got caught
speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.190
Well, remember Kurt?

12:11.210 --> 12:13.420
Your ex-boyfriend?

12:13.450 --> 12:16.520
Yeah. He got arrested for
taking a whiz on a cop car.

12:16.530 --> 12:18.550
- What?
- He was drunk.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.790
I would hope so.

12:20.810 --> 12:23.470
Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding
tickets and a bench warrant,

12:23.480 --> 12:26.420
so I, you know, I paid his fines.

12:26.450 --> 12:27.560
Did he pay you back?

12:27.590 --> 12:29.310
No, but he will.

12:29.350 --> 12:32.620
And that's based on the inherent
credit-worthiness of people

12:32.630 --> 12:36.000
who get drunk and urinate
on police vehicles?

12:36.310 --> 12:39.640
Leonard, I'm not gonna call
up Kurt and ask him for money.

12:39.660 --> 12:42.490
Well... what are you gonna do?

12:42.500 --> 12:45.730
I don't know, but I may have
to find a cheaper place to live.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.080
Oh, no...

12:49.130 --> 12:51.430
Oh, you don't want to do that.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.200
Why not?

12:53.230 --> 12:55.190
Moving is a big deal.

12:55.220 --> 12:59.170
You have to go to the
supermarket and get boxes,

12:59.230 --> 13:03.820
and if they're not clean, then your books
smell like melons, and it's just, like...

13:05.010 --> 13:07.560
Why don't you just get
a roommate a stay here?

13:07.590 --> 13:09.100
Well, do you know anybody?

13:09.130 --> 13:13.350
Well, I'm sure the guy living with
Sheldon wouldn't mind moving in with you.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.530
Oh, Leonard, honey, if we
started living together,

13:18.540 --> 13:21.720
I wouldn't be able to
keep my hands off you.

13:23.940 --> 13:26.260
Really?

13:27.030 --> 13:30.200
And you thought my acting
lessons were a waste of money.

13:35.920 --> 13:39.250
This moo shu pork's burning
a hole through my duodenum.

13:41.450 --> 13:47.810
Leviticus 11:3: "Only that which parteth the hoof
and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat."

13:50.260 --> 13:55.230
Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita
every time you scarf down a Whopper?

13:59.620 --> 14:00.580
Hey, what's going on?

14:00.620 --> 14:03.660
We're on a quest through the Valley
of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.480
You want the Valley of
Fire? It's right here.

14:08.330 --> 14:10.260
Hey, you guys want to
go on a real live quest?

14:10.290 --> 14:13.330
Outside? I just made cocoa.

14:14.110 --> 14:16.780
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- What is it?

14:17.080 --> 14:20.080
Do you guys remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?

14:22.700 --> 14:24.320
Yeah, that's him.

14:24.340 --> 14:28.280
It tur out he owes Penny a lot of
money, and I'm gonna go get it from him.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.090
Who's with me?

14:33.990 --> 14:36.090
Ooh, double sixes.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.490
Really? You're just
gonna let me go by myself?

14:38.500 --> 14:40.960
Oh, cool, I got a sword.

14:40.970 --> 14:43.220
I could use some help.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.250
Here.

14:46.440 --> 14:47.820
You guys are unbelievable.

14:47.850 --> 14:49.580
You play a game to simulate adventure,

14:49.620 --> 14:53.390
but when there's real adventure out there
in the real world, you just wimp out.

14:53.420 --> 14:59.040
Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited
this gentleman, we returned home without pants?

15:01.020 --> 15:02.910
- I do.
- Are you sure?

15:02.920 --> 15:05.650
Because your proposal
suggests that you don't.

15:05.660 --> 15:09.520
- I'm not afraid of him.
- All right. Leonard fairly calls the question:

15:09.530 --> 15:14.740
Who is in favor of abandoning our game and
confronting Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend

15:14.750 --> 15:18.810
in a suicidal mission to
extract money from him?

15:20.560 --> 15:23.260
Say hi to Kurt for us.

15:24.310 --> 15:25.550
Excuse me.

15:25.580 --> 15:28.220
When Frodo left the Shire to
take the one ring to Mordor,

15:28.240 --> 15:30.520
didn't Samwise, Pippin
d Merry go with him?

15:30.530 --> 15:31.670
- They did.
- Well?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.530
They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.

15:36.030 --> 15:38.580
Plus, no one stole their pants.

15:39.530 --> 15:44.110
Fine. Enjoy your little game.
I'll make this quest on my own.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.750
Leonard, wait.

15:45.780 --> 15:48.850
Take a jacket. It's shpritzing a little.

15:49.420 --> 15:51.680
You guys suck.

15:54.190 --> 15:57.280
Come on, please? He's so big.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.210
Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?

16:01.240 --> 16:03.810
Yes. Koothrappali's going to
wet himself, I'm gonna throw up,

16:03.820 --> 16:07.020
Sheldon's gonna run away,
and you're going to die.

16:08.730 --> 16:11.230
Shall we synchronize our watches?

16:11.250 --> 16:13.410
Guys, there are four
of us and one of him.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.790
Which means his triumph
will be even larger.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.490
Minstrels will write songs about him.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.010
Okay, how about this?
I'll do the talking.

16:22.020 --> 16:25.820
You just stand behind me
and try to look formidable.

16:31.230 --> 16:33.620
I should've peed before we left.

16:35.450 --> 16:37.210
Yeah?

16:40.280 --> 16:42.860
- Hi, Kurt.
- Lenny, right?

16:42.870 --> 16:44.810
I don't really go by
Lenny, but that's okay.

16:44.830 --> 16:49.290
Um, you remember
Sheldon, Howard and Raj.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.220
No. What do you want?

16:52.230 --> 16:54.920
You don't remember me? How
could he not remember me?

16:54.930 --> 16:55.980
Sheldon, not now.

16:55.990 --> 16:57.850
I remember him.

16:58.260 --> 17:01.400
Okay, here it is.Penny's
in kind of a financial jam,

17:01.410 --> 17:05.190
and the money that you owe her would
go a long way to solving her problems.

17:05.220 --> 17:06.720
And she sent you to get it from me?

17:06.750 --> 17:09.599
No, no, she's too proud
to ask for the money.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.339
I, on the other hand, feel
you should honor your debt.

17:12.369 --> 17:14.450
You do?

17:17.490 --> 17:19.650
Feel is a kind of a...
it's a strong word.

17:19.660 --> 17:23.010
Um, I just think it would be
a nice gesture on your part.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.640
She'll get it when she gets it.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.320
Well, there you go. Problem solved.

17:33.060 --> 17:37.000
A successful quest. Now let's go find
a gas station with a clean bathroom.

17:37.620 --> 17:40.990
No, the problem isn't
soed. He just ew uoff.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.260
********

17:49.110 --> 17:50.530
Come on, Leonard, let'go

17:50.540 --> 17:53.580
NoYou can leave if you want
to. I'gonna see this through.

17:53.590 --> 17:55.630
Okay.

18:00.870 --> 18:03.810
I guess, technically, that was my fault.

18:09.670 --> 18:12.780
I'm not leaving here
without Penny's money.

18:13.180 --> 18:15.820
What happened to your backup?

18:15.830 --> 18:18.180
I don't need backup.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.870
I have right on my side.

18:24.610 --> 18:27.840
And I'm wearing cargo
shorts under my pants.

18:30.330 --> 18:32.000
Congratulations.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.790
You may not have
succeeded in getting cash,

18:33.800 --> 18:37.580
but you did secure a formal
acknowledgment of the debt.

18:42.570 --> 18:45.910
Maybe we should have
your head notarized.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.510
If anybody cares, I still have to pee.

18:59.820 --> 19:02.740
- Is Sheldon here?
- Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!

19:02.750 --> 19:03.780
Nice hat.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.550
It's kind of a fashionable
look these days.

19:08.020 --> 19:11.050
Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.430
Hello, Penny.

19:12.440 --> 19:16.200
Sheldon, here is your money. Thank
you very much. It helped a lot.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.430
Sarcasm?

19:18.960 --> 19:20.080
No.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.700
Darn. I can't seem to
get the hang of that.

19:24.010 --> 19:27.380
Hey, I know it's none of my business,
but where did the money come from?

19:27.420 --> 19:31.580
Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and
picked up a few more hours at the restaurant,

19:31.620 --> 19:37.130
but the biggest thing was, out of the blue,
Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.

19:37.420 --> 19:41.300
Really? Did he say why?

19:41.310 --> 19:46.700
Yes, he said he was feeling guilty
and wanted to do what was right.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.880
That's it?

19:51.970 --> 19:57.110
Did he give any reason as to why
he came to this moral epiphany?

19:57.120 --> 20:01.100
Nope. I just think he's really changed.

20:02.620 --> 20:06.190
We're having dinner tomorrow night,
and I get to wear my new beret.

20:06.950 --> 20:08.390
Bye, guys.

20:08.950 --> 20:10.840
Bye.

20:14.740 --> 20:17.600
Well done, Leonard.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.050
The true hero doesn't seek adulation.

20:21.080 --> 20:25.290
He fights for right and justice
simply because it's his nature.

20:25.330 --> 20:30.730
Penny's hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend
and I have indelible ink on my forehead!

20:31.380 --> 20:35.380
That's your badge of honor--
your warrior's wound, if you will.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.150
I was wrong.

20:37.200 --> 20:40.290
Minstrels will write songs about you.

20:42.070 --> 20:43.920
Great.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.250
* There once was a
brave lad named Leonard *

20:47.760 --> 20:51.100
* With a -fi
fiddle dee-dee *

20:51.120 --> 20:54.110
* He faced a fearsome giant *

20:54.140 --> 20:56.840
* While Raj just wanted to pee.*
