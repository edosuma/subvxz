♪♪

00:04.380 --> 00:05.500
(Krei clears throat)

00:05.500 --> 00:07.750
And with this Kreitech
miracle micro battery,

00:07.750 --> 00:09.620
we will power the world...

00:09.620 --> 00:10.750
together!

00:10.750 --> 00:12.040
(cheers, applause)

00:13.250 --> 00:15.080
(laughing)
Thank you.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.750
-(phone beeps, applause stops)
-Barb: I'll take it!

00:16.750 --> 00:19.380
Uh, you there,
you shouldn't be in here.

00:19.380 --> 00:20.750
This is a closed rehearsal.

00:20.750 --> 00:23.380
But don't worry, the battery
will be available soon
for purchase.

00:23.380 --> 00:25.460
Did I say "purchase"? Ha!

00:27.250 --> 00:28.380
-Hey!
-Ha!

00:28.380 --> 00:29.960
Pretty sure I said "take it."

00:29.960 --> 00:31.080
Ow!

00:34.580 --> 00:36.120
-Ha!
-Aha!

00:36.120 --> 00:37.830
Juniper, what are you
doing here?

00:37.830 --> 00:40.580
Could you please tell Barb,
who I'm not speaking to

00:40.580 --> 00:43.210
because she betrayed
our mother-daughter bond,

00:43.210 --> 00:45.210
that I am taking the battery.

00:45.210 --> 00:46.750
Mother?

00:46.750 --> 00:48.040
(scoffs)
I don't believe you.

00:48.710 --> 00:49.750
-(Juniper grunts)
-(Krei groans)

00:49.750 --> 00:52.250
Yeah, I feel the resemblance.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.040
Young lady,
you give me that right now!

00:54.040 --> 00:55.830
No, Mother!
Not after what you did.

00:55.830 --> 00:57.330
This battery's mine!

00:57.330 --> 00:59.080
Not that you care about that.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.330
Just what is that
supposed to mean?

01:01.330 --> 01:03.620
You know exactly what it means.

01:03.620 --> 01:05.580
Juniper, cut the sass
and give me the battery!

01:05.580 --> 01:06.830
Never!

01:10.250 --> 01:12.500
(grunting)

01:12.500 --> 01:13.500
Okay, I know
I shouldn't say this,

01:13.500 --> 01:15.920
but you do realize there's
another battery right there.

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
Ha!

01:18.880 --> 01:20.000
(clattering)

01:20.000 --> 01:21.880
This is not how I raised you
to steal things!

01:21.880 --> 01:25.330
I'm my own
crime-dancer now, Mother!

01:25.330 --> 01:26.880
(whining)

01:26.880 --> 01:27.960
It'll do for now.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.080
(running footsteps receding)

01:32.080 --> 01:33.380
I should call my mom.

Bad news, San Fransokyo.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.540
Infamous mother-daughter duo,
High Voltage,

02:09.540 --> 02:10.960
broke danced
out of jail

02:10.960 --> 02:13.080
and are making
a crime-dance comeback.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.830
Go Go:
I get the crime.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.420
I don't get the dance.

02:16.420 --> 02:18.540
See, I get the dance.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.080
I don't get the crime.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.710
Let's just get them
back in jail.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.830
(shushing)

02:23.830 --> 02:25.290
Guys, Richardson Mole.

02:25.290 --> 02:26.880
He can't know that we're--

02:26.880 --> 02:29.540
-Big Hero 6.
-What about Big Hero 6?

02:30.250 --> 02:31.580
Nothing!

02:31.580 --> 02:34.540
Because if there's
something you want to know
about Big Hero 6,

02:34.540 --> 02:35.960
I'm the one to ask.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.330
I'm kind of an expert.

02:37.330 --> 02:38.420
Right.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.580
I see I piqued
your interest, Dream Girl.

02:41.580 --> 02:43.920
I'm not just a superhero expert.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.290
I know villains too.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.460
High Voltage, Glooby--

02:46.460 --> 02:48.420
Globby! I mean, um-- I--

02:48.420 --> 02:51.170
I mean, I believe
it is pronounced "Globby."

02:51.170 --> 02:54.460
Stay in your lane, Fred!
It's definitely Glooby.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.080
Uh, no, it's not.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.460
The man's a giant glob.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.960
Thus, his name is Glob-by.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.540
He's not a giant "gloob."

03:01.540 --> 03:03.290
You don't know what
you're talking about.

03:03.290 --> 03:05.830
Oh, I know exactly
what I'm talking about.

03:05.830 --> 03:07.540
-No, you don't!
-Yes, I do!

03:07.540 --> 03:09.670
You're ruining
my lunch serenity, guys.

03:09.670 --> 03:11.960
Yeah, move along, Richardson.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.710
This is my side of town.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.830
You have sides?

03:14.830 --> 03:16.420
Not for long.

03:16.420 --> 03:18.040
I'm buying
the lot next door.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.710
It will soon be home

03:19.710 --> 03:22.460
to the Mole Museum
of Superhero History.

03:22.460 --> 03:25.040
A superhero museum?
That was my idea!

03:25.040 --> 03:26.830
-Was not!
-Uh-huh!

03:26.830 --> 03:28.580
Stop. Just stop.

03:28.580 --> 03:31.330
Sure, anything
for you, Dream Girl.

03:31.330 --> 03:32.500
I wouldn't.

03:33.210 --> 03:34.540
(softly)
Some day.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.330
-Ugh!
-(grumbling)

03:36.330 --> 03:37.580
-(door closes)
-I hate that kid.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.420
Yeah, you really shouldn't
let him get to you, Freddie.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.120
He's just trolling you.
Do not engage.

03:50.710 --> 03:51.830
Hi there.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.460
Ma'am, you can't be in here.

03:53.460 --> 03:54.830
I'm so sorry
to bother you, officer,

03:54.830 --> 03:57.830
but my little ol' GPS here,
well, it just conked out,

03:57.830 --> 03:59.290
and I'm all turned around.

03:59.290 --> 04:00.710
Could you be a sweetheart
and point me

04:00.710 --> 04:01.920
in the right direction?

04:01.920 --> 04:03.830
Uh, okay.
Where you trying to go?

04:03.830 --> 04:06.790
Well, thank you, darling.
I'm trying to get...

04:06.790 --> 04:09.580
(grunting, groaning)

04:09.580 --> 04:10.670
...here.

04:17.670 --> 04:19.250
-(computer beeps)
-Got it.

04:21.540 --> 04:22.790
Come to...

04:22.790 --> 04:24.120
(gasps)

04:24.120 --> 04:26.420
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

04:26.420 --> 04:28.670
Having a bad day?

04:28.670 --> 04:30.880
Too bad. Because it's about
to get worse.

04:32.580 --> 04:33.960
(grunts)

04:33.960 --> 04:36.210
Who's having a bad day now?

04:36.210 --> 04:37.540
Still you!

04:39.210 --> 04:40.420
(Fred screaming)

04:41.580 --> 04:42.670
(pained voice)
And me.

04:48.420 --> 04:49.500
(growls)

04:49.500 --> 04:51.920
Yeah. Sorry about that.
Buh-bye!

04:51.920 --> 04:54.290
Great. High Voltage got away.

04:54.290 --> 04:56.790
Well, technically half
of High Voltage got away,

04:56.790 --> 04:58.920
since they're clearly not
working together anymore.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.540
So maybe we should
call her Half Voltage or--

05:01.540 --> 05:02.620
Ooh, ooh, I got it--

05:02.620 --> 05:05.420
Low Voltage. Eh? Eh?

05:05.420 --> 05:07.040
-Right?
-Look.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.290
-It's empty.
-Fred: Huh.

05:08.290 --> 05:11.420
Why would Low Voltage--
going with that name--

05:11.420 --> 05:13.210
want an empty box?

05:13.210 --> 05:15.330
She didn't want the box, Fred.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.710
She wanted whatever
was in the box.

05:17.710 --> 05:19.120
Their energy orb.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.170
Ah. Interesting theory,
Go Go.

05:21.170 --> 05:23.380
This requires research.

05:24.620 --> 05:27.670
Fred: The mother-daughter
supervillain section is so vast.

05:27.670 --> 05:29.250
Uh, here to start.

05:30.170 --> 05:31.580
(sniffing)

05:32.500 --> 05:33.790
What do you want?

05:33.790 --> 05:35.670
Just wanted to make sure
you weren't soiling

05:35.670 --> 05:37.380
my comics
with your finger dirt.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.790
Yeah. Well, I wish
you weren't soiling

05:39.790 --> 05:41.420
my life with your face.

05:41.420 --> 05:43.620
Oh, witty retort. Not!

05:43.620 --> 05:46.290
What? No! You cannot mock
with a "not!"

05:46.290 --> 05:47.620
That's just-- Wait.

05:47.620 --> 05:48.920
What is this?

05:48.920 --> 05:50.210
What does it look like?

05:51.290 --> 05:54.880
Wait, "Lizard Guy"
isn't even my-- his name!

05:54.880 --> 05:56.290
Yes, it is!
For your information,

05:56.290 --> 05:58.670
I am a close,
personal friend
of Big Hero 6.

05:58.670 --> 06:01.040
-No way!
-Or yes way.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.670
We hang out all the time.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.880
Brunch, kayaking.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.920
Last weekend,
we went apple picking.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.500
It was delightful!

06:08.500 --> 06:10.920
That is a bushel
of lies, Richardson!

06:10.920 --> 06:12.040
I know Big Hero 6,

06:12.040 --> 06:13.920
and they would never
pick fruit with you.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.920
-Ever!
-Oh, please.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.500
There's no way
you know Big Hero 6.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.290
They're big-time superheroes,
and you're just a big...

06:21.290 --> 06:22.380
(gasps)

06:22.380 --> 06:24.620
-...old...
-(gasps)

06:24.620 --> 06:25.620
...nobody.

06:25.620 --> 06:26.750
(squeals)

06:26.750 --> 06:30.960
I definitely know Big Hero 6
because I am Lizard Guy!

06:30.960 --> 06:34.210
Except that's not my name!
It's Fredzilla, baby.

06:35.620 --> 06:36.790
Fake.

06:36.790 --> 06:38.790
Yeah, I guess
this is fake too?

06:38.790 --> 06:39.790
(beeps)

06:39.790 --> 06:40.750
(whooshing)

06:42.420 --> 06:43.710
Ha!

06:46.040 --> 06:47.120
Oh!

06:47.120 --> 06:48.750
Uh... Uh...
(nervous laughter)

06:54.790 --> 06:56.000
Forget you saw that!

06:59.500 --> 07:00.670
Oh, no.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.880
Oh, no.
He's eating crackers.

07:15.880 --> 07:16.960
This is bad.

07:20.540 --> 07:21.880
Baymax:
I detect heightened stress.

07:21.880 --> 07:25.380
Indicated by cortisol
and crackers.

07:25.380 --> 07:27.670
-What's with the crackers?
-He's a guilt eater.

07:27.670 --> 07:28.880
What did you do?

07:31.120 --> 07:33.500
I told Richardson that
I'm a member of Big Hero 6!

07:33.500 --> 07:36.620
Ah! Crackers on my face!
Crackers on my face!

07:36.620 --> 07:38.080
Wait. You what?

07:38.080 --> 07:40.750
I know. I'm sorry. I broke
superhero rule number one.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.330
I'm a disgrace,
and I deserve to be punished.

07:42.330 --> 07:44.580
(grunting)

07:46.000 --> 07:48.250
I don't deserve
a cushion, Baymax.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.670
(grunts)

07:49.670 --> 07:51.750
Wait, wait, wait. Fred, what
exactly does Richardson know?

07:51.750 --> 07:53.750
Oh, I know a lot of things.

07:53.750 --> 07:56.750
If Fred's in Big Hero 6,
that means so are you.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.120
You. You.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.620
-You.
-Hello.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.170
And you.

08:01.170 --> 08:02.920
Dream Girl...
(sighs)

08:02.920 --> 08:03.830
just got dreamier.

08:03.830 --> 08:05.710
Ugh. Dream on.

08:05.710 --> 08:08.500
Yeah, we're not--
(nervous chuckle)

08:08.500 --> 08:10.080
You're not going
to tell anybody, right?

08:10.080 --> 08:11.830
If people knew,
it would be dangerous.

08:11.830 --> 08:14.000
(mocking) "If people knew,
it would be dangerous."

08:14.000 --> 08:16.120
Seriously, Richardson,
you have to keep it a secret.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.380
Sure, sure, a secret.

08:18.380 --> 08:19.960
My lips are sealed.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.250
-But...
-I knew there'd be a but!

08:23.250 --> 08:25.620
-I want something in return.
-What?

08:25.620 --> 08:27.620
To go on a date with--

08:27.620 --> 08:29.250
No way. Not happening.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.790
Go ahead. Tell everyone.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.500
(sighs)

08:32.500 --> 08:34.210
Fine. It was worth a try.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.790
-But...
-Ooh, I knew
there'd be another but!

08:37.790 --> 08:40.080
Oh, there are
a lot more buts, Fred.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.960
"I want Fred's first edition
of The Human Fist,

08:42.960 --> 08:45.000
"his entire
Captain Fancy collection,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.710
and his limited edition
Dr. Slaughter action figure."

08:48.710 --> 08:49.830
No way! You can't--

08:49.830 --> 08:50.880
-Done.
-Fine.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.000
-Take it.
-Okay.

08:52.000 --> 08:52.880
Wait, what?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.960
Okay. You can have
all of Fred's stuff

08:54.960 --> 08:57.120
as long as you keep
our identities a secret.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.250
-Wait!
-Baymax: Goodbye.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.380
No wait, Fred.

08:59.380 --> 09:01.460
You make a mess,
you clean it up.

09:02.210 --> 09:04.670
(grunts)
I hate when you're right!

09:07.210 --> 09:08.790
(slurping)

09:10.040 --> 09:11.080

09:13.210 --> 09:14.380
(electricity crackling)

09:15.040 --> 09:16.040
(glass shattering)

09:16.040 --> 09:17.670
Hello, Juniper.

09:17.670 --> 09:20.670

20:06.080 --> 20:07.290
(burps)

20:07.290 --> 20:08.580
Does this mean you're going
to keep our secret?

20:08.580 --> 20:10.710
(laughing)

20:10.710 --> 20:13.500
No way. I'm totally
going public with this.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.540
I've already got
an exclusive interview tomorrow

20:15.540 --> 20:17.420
with Good Morning,
San Fransokyo.

20:17.420 --> 20:20.330
Now if you don't mind, I'll be
taking the orb to my new museum.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.670
Richardson, don't!

20:22.670 --> 20:24.250
-(electricity crackles)
-(groaning)

20:24.250 --> 20:25.620
(gasps)

20:27.670 --> 20:30.210
(beeping)

20:40.080 --> 20:41.290
Baymax:
Hello.

20:41.290 --> 20:43.330
On a scale of one to ten,

20:43.330 --> 20:44.670
how would you rate your pain?

20:44.670 --> 20:46.080
I'm not in any pain.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.380
Why are you guys here?

20:48.380 --> 20:50.120
High Voltage attacked
your store...

20:50.120 --> 20:51.920
Wait, was Big Hero 6 here?

20:51.920 --> 20:53.120
W-W-Where are they?

20:53.120 --> 20:55.380
-You don't remember?
-Remember what?

20:55.380 --> 20:58.420
Fred revealed to you that
we are all members of Big--

20:58.420 --> 21:00.670
Uh-- Uh-- Big, uh--
Big nothing.

21:00.670 --> 21:02.880
(laughs nervously)
One big nothing!

21:05.670 --> 21:07.620
(chuckles)
He doesn't remember.

21:07.620 --> 21:10.290
Baymax: Perhaps the unique
nature of the orb's power

21:10.290 --> 21:11.540
caused memory loss.

21:11.540 --> 21:13.170
Okey-dokey,
let's go with that.

21:16.330 --> 21:18.000
Fred: Hey, buddy.
Need a hand?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.120
Pfft. Not from you, loser.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.000
Excuse me, but I just--

21:22.000 --> 21:24.500
(breathes deeply)
Staying calm.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.670
-You just what?
-Fred: Do not engage.

21:28.670 --> 21:29.500
Do not engage.

21:30.670 --> 21:32.250
Anyone have any crackers?

21:34.170 --> 21:36.000
(theme music playing)
