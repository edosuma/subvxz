01:43.800 --> 01:45.000
Whoo-hoo!

01:45.000 --> 01:46.900
G-a-b, hey! G-a-b, hey!

01:47.300 --> 01:49.000
It's so much soul

01:49.000 --> 01:50.900
Who's got the souls
of Rolling Stones?

01:50.900 --> 01:53.000
On the road that's cold

01:53.000 --> 01:54.800
What do we do? We G-a-b

01:54.800 --> 01:55.900
With the groove, with the vibe

01:55.900 --> 01:57.100
With the rhythm completely

01:57.100 --> 01:58.400
Jump on the mike, I bet

01:58.700 --> 02:00.900
We got soul, and don't you forget it

02:00.900 --> 02:02.900
So come, come, come,
come, come again

02:03.200 --> 02:05.200
I'm rocking on the mike

02:05.200 --> 02:06.700
So much soul

02:06.700 --> 02:09.199
We're young, we're hip

02:09.199 --> 02:12.900
Get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up...

02:12.900 --> 02:15.800
Come on, man. Let's go.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.500
We've got soul

02:39.500 --> 02:41.500
Uh, uh, uh, uh-huh

02:41.500 --> 02:43.100
I got it, you got it

02:43.600 --> 02:45.400
I got it, you got it

02:45.700 --> 02:49.000
He's got soul

02:49.700 --> 02:51.100
I got it, you got it

02:51.100 --> 02:51.800
Here we go, here we go

02:51.800 --> 02:52.500
You got it

02:52.500 --> 02:54.000
1, 2, here we go again

02:54.000 --> 02:55.200
Your mouth's ready to blow again

02:55.200 --> 02:56.500
Making sure, jack...

03:04.600 --> 03:06.800
"Reihi was a Taniwha.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.000
"She lived at the bottom
of a huge lake.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.100
"She spent most of her time

03:11.100 --> 03:13.900
"taking care of a greenstone wall.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.100
"The wall stopped the water

03:15.100 --> 03:16.600
"from flooding over the people

03:16.600 --> 03:18.200
"who lived by Reihi's lake.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.800
"Once a month, the people would bring

03:20.800 --> 03:22.600
"a huge piece of greenstone

03:22.600 --> 03:24.900
to help Reihi keep the wall strong. "

03:24.900 --> 03:26.300
especially if you drive around

03:26.300 --> 03:27.600
the big towns, people.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.500
Hope you love my wife, you know...

03:41.600 --> 03:43.100
I was just checking out

03:43.100 --> 03:45.400
the weather situation.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.300
A few showers as well

03:49.300 --> 03:50.300
and light winds at first,

03:50.300 --> 03:51.300
but it's going to be getting better

03:51.300 --> 03:54.100
throughout the day and the night...

03:56.600 --> 03:58.300
A bit of cloud
and a bit of rain as well.

03:58.900 --> 04:01.000
People, I've just had
a phone call from Darren.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.200
Now, apparently, Darren's
just lost his girlfriend.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.600
Brother...

04:06.400 --> 04:08.400
I'd say we are in business, my man.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.800
What's happening, everybody?

04:24.400 --> 04:25.800
Aah!

04:31.500 --> 04:33.300
Settle down!

04:34.100 --> 04:36.000
"Then the children
would run and laugh

04:36.000 --> 04:39.400
as they collected all the fish
Reihi had left for them. "

04:40.400 --> 04:42.100
Was it a good story, kids?

04:42.400 --> 04:44.000
Well, I liked it.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.100
No. It's dumb.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.900
What's a Taniwha?

04:48.800 --> 04:50.800
It's a creature
that looks after people.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.200
Where the fuck is everyone?!

04:55.200 --> 04:56.700
What are you doing home?

04:56.700 --> 04:59.200
I got something for you.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.500
Come on, Hu, let's go!

05:08.400 --> 05:09.400
Go on, open it.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.700
What do you reckon, kids?

05:10.700 --> 05:12.000
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

05:14.400 --> 05:15.800
Oh, yum!

05:16.700 --> 05:18.600
- Oh, Jake!
- Look at all the kai moana!

05:18.600 --> 05:20.000
Bloody oceans of the stuff!

05:20.300 --> 05:21.500
- I'm hungry!
- Me, too!

05:21.500 --> 05:22.300
Go on, kids. Grab some.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.600
Take it outside.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.100
Come on, Hu.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.900
Got to eat them outside.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.300
Where the fuck you off to?
Come have a feed, boy.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.400
No.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.500
Fuck him.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.500
Jake, not on the table, hon.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.000
Oh, why not? I want a feed.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.400
Well, the kids might come in.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.200
Well, what about the chair?

06:50.800 --> 06:52.200
Remember?

07:11.600 --> 07:13.000
So...

07:14.100 --> 07:17.800
where did all the seafood come from?

07:17.800 --> 07:19.300
I got lucky.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.000
I got laid off.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.500
What?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.900
Whoa, whoa, woman. Let me finish.

07:25.900 --> 07:29.100
Jake Heke, you've got
a family to feed.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.100
- You've got bills.
- Look, I've signed up for the dole.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.600
It's only 17 bucks a week
less than my wages.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.200
Well, don't look like that.
It's not the end of the world.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.400
What about our house?

07:39.700 --> 07:41.200
We got a house,

07:41.200 --> 07:42.900
and the government ain't
going to kick us out.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.200
The rent's cheap.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.600
I want us to have
our own home, Jake.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.600
Damn you. We can't make
bloody ends meet as it is.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.200
Forget the bloody house.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.600
Let's talk about the bedroom.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.800
Oh, don't, Jake!

08:10.600 --> 08:12.900
You fucking got to spoil
everything, don't you?

08:14.100 --> 08:15.600
Fuck you!

08:51.300 --> 08:55.100
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

08:55.100 --> 08:58.100
Scoo da da do wa oh

09:00.100 --> 09:03.200
Ooh, I left this mark
on this world

09:05.700 --> 09:09.000
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

09:09.400 --> 09:12.400
Scoo da da do wa oh

09:12.400 --> 09:13.700
Yo, Toot.

09:13.700 --> 09:14.600
Yo, G.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.600
What you up to?

09:15.600 --> 09:17.500
Oh, you know, a bit
of this and the other.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.300
You never know when
the Queen might drop by.

09:19.300 --> 09:23.100
Well, if she does,
here's something to feed her.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.200
Bloody Santa Claus!

09:36.100 --> 09:38.400
Do you think we'll ever
get out of here, Toot?

09:39.900 --> 09:41.700
I don't know.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.200
Maybe.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.900
You know, when I'm old enough
to get the dole,

09:45.900 --> 09:49.200
I might just do this baby up
and drive on out.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.300
Can I come, too?

09:51.300 --> 09:53.000
Of course. You're my best mate.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.000
Hey, Gracie, did you
bring your book?

10:03.400 --> 10:05.100
Oh, I forgot.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.900
I just finished a new story, too,

10:07.800 --> 10:09.500
but I can remember most of it.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.800
Choice!

10:10.800 --> 10:13.200
The story was about a Taniwha.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.800
Do you know what a Taniwha is?

10:16.100 --> 10:18.800
Well, Reihi was a Taniwha.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.600
She lived at the bottom
of this lake.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.400
Now, she spent most of her time

10:22.400 --> 10:25.700
looking after this huge
greenstone wall.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.200
The wall stopped the water

10:27.200 --> 10:28.900
from flooding over the people

10:28.900 --> 10:30.900
who lived by Reihi's lake.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.900
Once a month, the people would bring...

10:34.500 --> 10:36.100
Beth Heke?

10:37.200 --> 10:38.700
What now?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.600
Been keeping bad company.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.200
Was that before or after
you picked him up?

10:46.400 --> 10:48.100
So what's the charge?

10:48.100 --> 10:49.300
Oh, he's lucky this time.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.800
Two older boys stole the car.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.800
He's just hanging around
with the wrong crowd.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.500
Still, it's not going
to look good tomorrow

10:54.500 --> 10:56.800
when he appears in court
on those other charges.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.600
You think you know everything
about us, don't you?

10:59.600 --> 11:01.100
It's my job.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.100
Is she a Taniwha, Mom?

11:05.200 --> 11:06.800
No, son.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.100
Well, we'll leave
Boogie with you, then.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.600
- Mark.
- Pardon?

11:11.600 --> 11:13.700
My son's name is Mark.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.900
Well, that's not
the name he gave us.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.800
You get those lonely, lonely

11:25.800 --> 11:27.900
Lonely, lonely blues

11:27.900 --> 11:30.600
When you're on your own.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.700
Mm-hmm

11:33.700 --> 11:36.300
So all you've got to do

11:36.300 --> 11:38.500
Is call up on the phone

11:38.500 --> 11:41.000
No need to be alone.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.300
Mm-hmm

11:44.300 --> 11:47.300
And if you lose your way

11:47.300 --> 11:50.700
And you've got nowhere to go...

11:51.500 --> 11:53.400
The usual.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.000
What's your fucking problem?

12:18.300 --> 12:19.400
Check that out, bro.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.400
The man can sure pack a punch.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.400
He's been behind bars, I bet.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.900
Yeah, right. Bloody zoo.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.000
If I wanted to drink with women,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I'd drink in the bloody
lounge bar, huh?

12:45.100 --> 12:46.900
I've had women up to here.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.600
Come on, Polly. Help your sister.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.400
Set the table, girl.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.800
There are reports that they've had

12:53.800 --> 12:55.400
at least one sighting of the Virgin.

12:55.700 --> 12:59.000
Oh, no wonder we got it...

12:59.000 --> 13:01.300
Why, Boog?

13:01.900 --> 13:03.600
Don't know.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.900
You don't know?

13:06.800 --> 13:09.300
Do you know you
have to go to court tomorrow?

13:09.600 --> 13:12.100
Do you remember what Bennett said?

13:12.900 --> 13:15.300
Jeez, Boog, what's
bloody wrong with you?

13:16.600 --> 13:17.300
Don't know.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.400
When you were a kid,
you wouldn't even take

13:18.400 --> 13:20.500
a piece of fruit without asking.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.600
You're going to come
tomorrow, aren't you, Mom?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.400
Yes, we'll be there. Will you?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.300
Yeah. Just keep your hands

13:40.300 --> 13:41.700
in your pockets there, brother.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.200
Come on, bro. I'd just
like to see them smile.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.200
Oh, you mean like this?

13:47.400 --> 13:48.800
You dirty bastard.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.400
I can make mine smile all right.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.900
I just can't make the woman happy.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.400
I took a big feed
of seafood home today...

13:54.400 --> 13:55.500
bloody everything.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.400
Just wanted to put
a smile on her face.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.700
You think she'd let me? No chance.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.600
All I told her was I got laid off.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.700
Anyone would have thought I told her

14:04.700 --> 14:06.600
that my prick dropped off.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.800
Laid off twice in one day, eh, bro?

14:09.800 --> 14:12.700
Poor bastard.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.700
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

14:20.000 --> 14:23.900
You're leaving home in the morning

14:25.900 --> 14:29.100
You come on home in the night

14:30.700 --> 14:33.300
Ooh, babe...

14:34.900 --> 14:37.300
Fucking beautiful.

14:38.300 --> 14:41.200
And when I ask you, babe

14:41.200 --> 14:43.900
You just say, you're right

14:44.600 --> 14:46.600
But you don't know

14:46.600 --> 14:50.500
What my heart's been going through

14:51.200 --> 14:53.000
Staying up late

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Just waitin' on you

14:56.900 --> 15:00.900
When will you be the one for me?

15:01.600 --> 15:04.600
Oh, yeah, without your love

15:05.000 --> 15:06.700
I can't make it

15:07.600 --> 15:09.300
You're all...

15:30.900 --> 15:32.300
Gee, where did you
get those muscles from?

15:32.300 --> 15:34.800
Bro, you've been lifting
those weights, huh?

15:35.900 --> 15:37.300
What, you've done lag?
Am I right?

15:37.300 --> 15:40.000
You want to fuck with me?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.600
You should learn
to pay your respects.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.400
In case you want
to know, it's Jake...

15:53.700 --> 15:57.700
Jake the Muss.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.500
Mmm, loving you is all I need, boy

16:12.300 --> 16:15.000
I was right... too much weights,
not enough speed work.

16:15.000 --> 16:15.900
Useless prick.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.900
Cheers.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.900
Into me

16:20.900 --> 16:22.800
Am I not enough for you...

16:22.800 --> 16:26.800
Party at my place tonight, boys.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.800
Come on, Poll. Bed.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.100
Come on, Hu.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.000
Hurry up, Polly.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.500
Thanks, Bub.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.300
- Good night, Mum.
- Night-night, Polly.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.900
You, too, mister.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.300
You've got a big day tomorrow.

16:54.900 --> 16:56.600
You won't forget, eh, Mum?

16:57.100 --> 16:57.800
How can I forget

16:57.800 --> 17:00.800
with you reminding me
every 5 minutes?

17:04.200 --> 17:05.700
Good night, son.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.300
Good night, Mum.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.500
Whoo-hoo!

18:18.700 --> 18:20.300
Your old man was
sure swinging tonight.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.500
He'll be swinging, all right,

18:22.500 --> 18:24.000
by the time I've finished with him.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.000
Did you hear he got the sack?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.200
Doesn't surprise me, girl...

18:27.200 --> 18:28.500
days he took off.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.100
Beth, babe.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.000
Dooley!

18:31.000 --> 18:32.800
You should have seen
the Muss in action.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.800
It was beautiful.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.000
He decked a bloody gorilla.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.600
He was big. Man, was he big.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.300
Fucking huge.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.300
It has to be said...

18:42.300 --> 18:44.300
almost as big as that
thing in Bully's pants.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.700
Notice he said almost, ladies?

18:48.100 --> 18:49.300
Yeah, right.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.500
Hey, girl, you should have
seen him, though.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.500
Dool's right... big...

18:53.800 --> 18:55.200
and bloody ugly.

18:55.800 --> 18:59.200
Well, he didn't get
everything right, though.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.500
Well, it's just that Bully
isn't that big, girl.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

19:35.100 --> 19:37.200
Mmm, you're hot tonight, girl.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.000
Yeah, ever since Jake

19:39.000 --> 19:42.100
put his hand halfway up my skirt.

19:42.100 --> 19:45.800
Ooh, I might have to
go home early tonight.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.000
Yo, Mave. Give us a song.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.500
Come on, Mave!

19:52.500 --> 19:54.800
How about you and Beth sing for me?

19:54.800 --> 19:58.800
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

20:07.400 --> 20:08.900
OK, OK, OK.

20:08.900 --> 20:12.200
Give us a G. Give us a G.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.200
Well, I've tried

20:15.900 --> 20:17.000
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

20:17.000 --> 20:19.400
As hard as I can

20:21.100 --> 20:23.200
Just to make you

20:24.700 --> 20:27.300
Understand

20:28.600 --> 20:31.100
'Cause the world

20:32.300 --> 20:34.900
It won't stop

20:36.000 --> 20:38.100
It keeps goin'

20:38.700 --> 20:41.200
Goin' round and round

20:43.300 --> 20:46.100
I guess the nature

20:46.800 --> 20:49.300
The nature of love

20:51.400 --> 20:53.500
Hurts always, always

20:54.400 --> 20:56.300
What are you doing?

20:56.300 --> 20:58.800
Couldn't you sleep, either?

20:58.800 --> 21:00.900
Aren't they beautiful
when they're like that?

21:01.800 --> 21:02.900
I wish I could see them.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.700
I remember

21:04.700 --> 21:06.200
They're just drunk. That's all.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.300
All those yesterdays

21:08.600 --> 21:13.100
People show their true feelings
when they're drunk.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.000
Understanding

21:16.000 --> 21:19.300
Man, Gracie, you've got
some far-out ideas.

21:19.300 --> 21:21.100
I thought Mum said
you were growing up.

21:21.100 --> 21:23.900
At least I'm not going
to court tomorrow.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.000
Oh, sorry, Boog.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.300
I didn't mean it.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.100
Oh, what the hell.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.900
What's the worst that can happen?

21:36.200 --> 21:38.700
The nature of love

21:40.600 --> 21:45.400
And it's always,
always been this way

21:48.300 --> 21:50.600
So, now, my lover

21:51.900 --> 21:54.400
There'll be no other

21:55.800 --> 21:58.300
The stars in the heavens

21:59.500 --> 22:01.900
Will shine forever

22:03.300 --> 22:05.800
Moments we treasure

22:07.400 --> 22:10.600
You and I in love

22:11.800 --> 22:14.200
So, darlin'

22:14.200 --> 22:16.200
Here is my heart

22:19.400 --> 22:20.700
So, darlin'

22:21.700 --> 22:23.300
Here is my heart

22:27.000 --> 22:28.700
So, darlin'

22:29.200 --> 22:30.900
Here is my heart

22:36.900 --> 22:38.900
Ohh

22:40.400 --> 22:41.500
Yeah

22:46.100 --> 22:48.500
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

22:48.500 --> 22:50.500
You're a hard lady, Bethie.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.900
And you're a hard man, Jakey.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.200
Play another one, someone.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.300
Next time, watch what you say

23:12.300 --> 23:14.900
in front of the fucking women!

23:14.900 --> 23:17.300
How's that for true feelings?

23:27.400 --> 23:29.400
Oh, don't play that shit, friend.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.900
Play something we all know.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.200
Later!

23:42.900 --> 23:45.000
Have a feed. Have a feed.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.900
Have a feed.

23:50.900 --> 23:54.800
Hey, Mavis, come have
a drink with me, mate!

24:01.600 --> 24:02.600
What's up with bloody Millie?

24:03.600 --> 24:06.200
Is she spoiling the party, or what?

24:06.200 --> 24:08.600
Too much gin and not enough sex.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.600
Hey, hey, hey.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.300
I'm not going to miss out tonight.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.700
Dooley, eh?

24:27.500 --> 24:31.400
Strike when the pants
are ready to drop.

24:31.800 --> 24:35.800
Looks like they've
already dropped, Mave.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.000
Bloody bastard!

24:41.000 --> 24:43.500
Never mind him, Mave.
Come have a feed.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.400
There's still a bit left
in the bottom.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.700
Dooley, what the fuck
are you doing?

24:50.700 --> 24:52.200
You're with me!

24:53.900 --> 24:55.200
Got any money?

24:55.900 --> 24:57.600
Money?

24:57.600 --> 24:59.300
What for?

24:59.300 --> 25:01.400
You don't need money.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.300
You got everything
you want right here.

25:04.300 --> 25:06.700
You got booze, food.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.500
The old man.

25:11.900 --> 25:13.200
Don't give me your bullshit excuses!

25:13.200 --> 25:14.400
Come on. Let's go.

25:14.400 --> 25:17.400
Have a drink with me, son.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.300
Remember how we used to
talk and laugh?

25:30.800 --> 25:32.900
We could talk and talk,
you and me.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.300
Remember?

25:34.700 --> 25:36.100
You're drunk.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.100
I'm not drunk.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.600
I'm happy.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.300
Then you're out of your fuckin' head.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.400
Oh, I'm so sorry, babe.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.200
I didn't... hang on.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.900
Hang on, son. I got some money.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.100
Hey, cook us some eggs, eh, Beth?

26:04.100 --> 26:05.000
Ooh, and some bacon.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.900
Fuck off!

26:06.900 --> 26:08.100
What the fuck's going on?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.100
I asked for some eggs, but...

26:10.400 --> 26:13.100
Cook the man some eggs.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.200
You want eggs?

26:19.600 --> 26:21.600
Well, have the bloody lot of them!

26:23.200 --> 26:24.900
It's OK, man.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.900
Cook the man some fucking eggs.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.500
Do it yourself, Jake!

26:30.900 --> 26:33.300
I'm not the fuckin' slave
around here, Jake!

26:35.500 --> 26:38.000
No, you can...

26:52.900 --> 26:55.900
You're a fuckin' coward!

26:58.400 --> 27:00.900
Leave her alone,
you fucking bastard!

27:00.900 --> 27:03.400
Stop it! Stop it!

27:06.700 --> 27:09.100
It's OK, Poll.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.700
Shh! Shh!

27:12.100 --> 27:13.400
Shush, Hu.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.200
Shh!

27:15.700 --> 27:17.600
I want Mummy!

27:17.600 --> 27:18.700
Shush, Hu.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
It's OK, Poll.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.800
Your fuckin' mouth!

27:25.300 --> 27:27.400
You do as you're fucking told!

28:25.100 --> 28:26.800
Fuck. Last time, I got 20 bucks.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.700
So what are you up to, Gracie?

28:28.700 --> 28:30.000
You could help.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.900
Not me. Waste of bloody time.

28:31.900 --> 28:33.000
You should leave it.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.200
There'll be plenty of time
for you to clean up

28:34.200 --> 28:36.000
after drunken fucking parties.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.900
What do you mean?

28:39.300 --> 28:41.200
When you get married, girl.

28:41.500 --> 28:42.900
Who said I want to?

28:42.900 --> 28:44.800
It's just the way things are.

28:44.800 --> 28:47.200
No. The fellas around here
are too ugly.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.300
It's just a matter of time, Gracie.

28:57.500 --> 29:01.500
Who did the prick smack over?

29:02.700 --> 29:03.800
Grace?

29:07.500 --> 29:09.900
The fuckin' bastard!

29:10.200 --> 29:11.100
Where are you going?

29:11.100 --> 29:12.900
Out of this fuckin' hole!

29:33.800 --> 29:35.600
They've eaten the whole lot.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.300
I'm hungry.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.100
How about some Chinese?

29:46.200 --> 29:47.100
Yuck!

29:49.600 --> 29:51.500
Where's Mum?

29:51.500 --> 29:54.000
Well, she's not bloody here, is she?

29:55.200 --> 29:58.500
Look, there's one more pea.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.600
Mum?

30:43.700 --> 30:46.000
Yeah, I know, Boog.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.100
Do you want an aspirin?

30:50.800 --> 30:52.400
Listen, Boog...

30:52.400 --> 30:54.600
Grace can go with you, eh?

30:54.600 --> 30:57.300
Give a good impression.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.300
I'm not feeling the best, son.

31:00.300 --> 31:02.800
Just give me time to wash up.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.700
Nothing that a good
coffee won't fix.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.100
I'll catch a later bus.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.400
OK, Boog?

31:09.400 --> 31:10.700
Ya, sure.

31:14.500 --> 31:18.500
We love the reggae girls,
we love the reggae girls

31:19.900 --> 31:21.500
The reggae music make you
jump and stomp, yes

31:22.200 --> 31:23.800
The reggae music make you
dance and prance, yes

31:24.100 --> 31:26.300
So everybody come
and shake your butt, yes

31:26.300 --> 31:28.700
'Cause this the music,
and I'm the best, yes

31:28.700 --> 31:31.600
And this is something
that they must confess, yes...

31:32.500 --> 31:34.300
Do you reckon we should go in?

31:34.300 --> 31:35.800
Nah. Wait for Mum.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.500
Come on, son. We're running late.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.200
Didn't I tell you I was
picking you up this morning?

31:40.500 --> 31:41.800
Forgot.

31:42.100 --> 31:42.900
Come on.

31:43.900 --> 31:47.000
Bit of trouble
at your place last night.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.800
Look, Mark, I have to be honest.

31:53.900 --> 31:54.900
You're on remand.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.400
The cops say they
found you on the streets.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.700
They're going to try
and persuade the judge

31:58.700 --> 32:00.800
that your parents can't control you.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.300
I've seen your mother.

32:09.300 --> 32:12.100
I don't think she's going
to make it here this morning.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.300
She's going to catch a later bus.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.000
- Morning.
- Hi.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.500
Mark, you ready? Better go in.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.300
Come on.

32:31.900 --> 32:34.200
Nig Heke, eh?

32:34.700 --> 32:37.300
Son of Jake the Muss.

32:38.900 --> 32:40.800
You a bit of a chip off
the old block, boy?

32:40.800 --> 32:42.700
I'm nothing like him.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.800
Yeah, we'll see.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.600
So today's the day, boy.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.600
Judgment day.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.600
How bad do you want in?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.500
Didn't hear you, boy.

32:58.900 --> 33:00.700
I want a patch.

33:00.700 --> 33:02.600
You hear that, brothers?

33:02.600 --> 33:04.400
He wants a patch.

33:06.200 --> 33:09.400
You'll have to get through me first.

33:13.500 --> 33:16.000
Do all right with women, boy?

33:16.300 --> 33:18.200
I do all right.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.100
Must be your flashy smile, eh?

33:23.100 --> 33:25.700
Value your teeth?

33:25.700 --> 33:27.500
You like your pretty-boy face.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.100
Call you Michael Jackson,

33:31.100 --> 33:32.700
except we'll rearrange it for free.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.100
You think about that, boy,

33:36.100 --> 33:39.300
before you think about any patch.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.900
Is that right, Mark?

33:42.400 --> 33:44.800
You admit to the burglaries?

33:46.500 --> 33:47.900
And what about these
motor-vehicle charges?

33:48.600 --> 33:50.000
Will you be withdrawing those?

33:50.000 --> 33:51.700
Yes, your honor, but we recommend

33:51.700 --> 33:53.400
that Mark goes into
social welfare custody.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.900
Take your hat off, please, sergeant.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.600
We picked him up yesterday.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.600
Sir, it's pretty clear
that his parents

33:58.600 --> 33:59.900
can't look after him.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.200
And, um...

34:02.200 --> 34:04.300
what do you two have?

34:04.300 --> 34:05.900
I'm in a difficult position.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.600
I've had no contact
with Mark's parents, and...

34:08.199 --> 34:10.699
Yes, well, I was hoping

34:10.699 --> 34:12.400
the boy's mother would be here today.

34:13.199 --> 34:14.400
I was around there this morning,

34:14.400 --> 34:16.199
and after what I saw...

34:17.500 --> 34:19.600
I don't think Mark
should be at home.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.500
Yes. Yes. All right.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.400
Things seem to be going
from bad to worse

34:23.400 --> 34:25.300
for you, don't they, Mark?

34:25.900 --> 34:26.900
Under the circumstances,

34:26.900 --> 34:28.800
if your parents can't control you,

34:29.400 --> 34:32.600
I'll have to remand you
in social welfare custody.

35:06.300 --> 35:07.900
Nig Heke's brother.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.500
Looks like a fucking poofter to me.

35:10.500 --> 35:14.300
Baby, you can fuck
with me any day.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.500
Now, you can either
do this the hard way,

35:22.900 --> 35:24.100
or you can make it work for you.

35:24.100 --> 35:26.400
- It's your choice.
- What do you mean?

35:27.200 --> 35:28.400
You can let me help you,

35:28.400 --> 35:30.400
and you might learn something,

35:30.400 --> 35:31.900
or you could end up in jail.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.000
Because that's where you're heading.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.800
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I see you a moment?

35:34.800 --> 35:38.300
Uh, yeah. I'll see you outside.

35:43.800 --> 35:44.700
Please try, Boog.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.500
It can't be that bad, eh?

35:48.500 --> 35:51.600
At least you'll be doing
something different.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.100
Hey, I could even write to you.

35:57.100 --> 36:00.600
I've never had anyone
to write to before.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.400
Gee, girl, you started without me.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.500
Jeez, woman, is that the result

36:16.500 --> 36:18.500
of one hell of an orgasm or what?

36:18.500 --> 36:19.800
What the hell happened?

36:22.300 --> 36:24.000
Same old story.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.100
Never learn to keep my mouth shut.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.400
Help yourself to a beer.

36:30.700 --> 36:31.400
Ah, what the hell.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.200
Surprised there's any left.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.100
Well, you know the rules, girl.

36:36.100 --> 36:39.100
Keep your mouth shut
and your legs open.

36:41.100 --> 36:43.200
Didn't get to court, then, eh?

36:44.600 --> 36:46.100
Like this?

36:47.100 --> 36:49.900
Do more harm than good.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.600
Welfare came round this morning.

36:56.500 --> 36:59.200
Promised Boog I'd be there for him.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.200
That boy's got to learn
to stand on his own two feet.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.200
You're going to
have to take a chain saw

37:03.200 --> 37:05.700
to those apron strings, girl.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.800
He's not strong
like the others, Mave.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.000
Ah, shit. I remember
when he was a wee fella.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.100
Couldn't tear him off you.

37:14.700 --> 37:15.900
He'll be all right.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.200
It's Nig I'd worry about.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.400
It doesn't seem
like that long ago

37:21.400 --> 37:24.000
that Nig was a baby.

37:24.300 --> 37:25.400
Well, he's not a baby anymore,

37:25.400 --> 37:27.200
that's for sure!

37:28.000 --> 37:30.400
Jeez, you should have
seen Jake, Mave,

37:31.300 --> 37:33.400
boasting about his baby boy...

37:35.900 --> 37:38.000
till Nig started crying at night.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.000
That's about when those
two parted company.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.900
Ain't that the truth?
Bloody men.

37:43.900 --> 37:46.600
Jeez, he was a beautiful baby, Mave.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.100
Oh, enough bloody talk, girl.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.500
Hit the fella over the head!

37:50.500 --> 37:52.400
Tell him to wake his ideas up.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.700
Bloody gangs.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.100
Kati!

37:59.900 --> 38:02.200
So how you doing, boy?

38:04.300 --> 38:06.700
The brothers can't hear you, boy.

38:08.600 --> 38:09.900
Timata!

38:09.900 --> 38:11.200
Kati!

38:56.400 --> 38:57.900
Brother,

38:58.200 --> 39:00.700
now you've met your new family.

39:30.900 --> 39:31.900
Grace!

40:24.900 --> 40:27.500
I wanted to be there, Grace.

40:28.500 --> 40:30.100
I couldn't.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.300
They'd have sent him away.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.800
You've seen the state of me, Bub.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.300
They did.

40:38.300 --> 40:40.100
They did, Mum.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.300
They sent Boog away.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.600
But how can they do that...

40:50.700 --> 40:52.900
just take someone's son away?

40:54.600 --> 40:56.300
It's OK, Mum.

40:56.300 --> 40:58.400
Boog seemed OK.

40:58.400 --> 41:01.200
He should be at home with us.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.500
Can't a man get some
fuckin' sleep around here?

41:12.100 --> 41:13.500
Fuck, woman, you look fucking awful.

41:13.500 --> 41:14.900
Go clean yourself up.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.600
This is as cleaned up

41:16.600 --> 41:18.200
as I get, you bastard.

41:19.100 --> 41:20.700
Tried getting cleaned up
all morning

41:20.700 --> 41:22.600
so I could go to court with our son.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.700
Our son, Jake!

41:24.700 --> 41:26.800
What the fuck's Nig been up to?

41:28.000 --> 41:29.600
You have no idea, do you?

41:30.500 --> 41:32.200
Boogie!

41:32.900 --> 41:35.100
Boogie? Is that right?

41:35.400 --> 41:37.400
He's gone, Jake.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.900
He's gone to welfare, and you slept

41:39.900 --> 41:42.900
through the whole bloody thing.

41:44.300 --> 41:45.300
Is that all?

41:46.700 --> 41:49.000
Is that what all this
slamming of fucking doors,

41:49.500 --> 41:51.700
crying, and carrying on is about?

41:52.400 --> 41:53.700
Fuck!

41:54.700 --> 41:55.900
The boy is soft.

41:55.900 --> 41:58.200
It'll toughen him up.

41:58.500 --> 42:00.800
Anyone would think
he bloody died or something.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.900
Hey, so go do something
about the way you look.

42:03.900 --> 42:06.800
You're starting to
make me feel fucking sick.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.700
You did this to me, you bastard.

42:09.700 --> 42:12.500
I hope you spew your guts out.

42:14.100 --> 42:16.600
You know your fucking
problem, eh, woman?

42:17.100 --> 42:18.700
You're too bloody lippy,

42:18.700 --> 42:20.100
too bloody smart-mouthed.

42:20.100 --> 42:22.200
You're a bad example
for the fucking kids.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.700
Always writing, aren't you?
Too fucking smart.

42:24.700 --> 42:27.800
You'll end up like
your mother here.

42:34.200 --> 42:37.200
I hate him.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.300
Bring your book here, Bub.

42:51.300 --> 42:53.700
What you been writing?

42:54.700 --> 42:57.600
I was going to write to Boog.

42:57.900 --> 43:00.600
You got a good nature, girl.

43:02.900 --> 43:05.400
Mr. Bennett said we could visit.

43:06.800 --> 43:09.200
It's all right for those fellas.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.900
They've got everything
at their fingertips...

43:11.900 --> 43:14.500
flashy car, plenty of money.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.300
Easy for them.

43:17.300 --> 43:18.800
Knew we couldn't.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.100
I didn't say we couldn't.

43:33.300 --> 43:35.400
It just won't be easy.

43:36.300 --> 43:38.400
Got to find the money.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.300
Do you think we could?

43:42.300 --> 43:45.000
Yes. Yes, I do.

43:47.900 --> 43:50.000
I promise.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.900
I love you, Mum.

43:56.900 --> 43:59.000
I love you, too, Bub.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.100
Come and suck on this.

44:14.600 --> 44:16.700
You fellas are too ugly.

44:31.300 --> 44:34.000
Did you hear? Boog got sent away.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.400
Yeah, I heard.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.800
- Boys' home, right?
- Ya.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.700
- You want a puff?
- Nah.

44:44.100 --> 44:46.700
Well, yeah. Why not?

44:53.600 --> 44:55.300
He's going to be OK, though.

44:56.100 --> 44:58.400
And you know why?

44:58.400 --> 45:00.300
Because Mum said we can visit...

45:00.300 --> 45:01.800
you know, as a family.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.300
Isn't that choice?

45:04.300 --> 45:06.400
Yeah. Yeah. Choice.

45:08.500 --> 45:10.500
What do you think
it'll be like?

45:10.500 --> 45:12.900
What? The boys' home?

45:12.900 --> 45:14.700
Got to be better than this car.

45:16.400 --> 45:17.900
You going to hold on to that

45:17.900 --> 45:19.000
till it goes out?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.400
Oh. Sorry.

45:27.700 --> 45:29.300
You're the only one
I can talk to.

45:29.300 --> 45:31.200
You know that, Toot?

45:31.200 --> 45:33.300
Yeow, G. Best mates...

45:33.900 --> 45:35.300
forever.

45:45.300 --> 45:47.200
250 smackeroonies.

45:47.600 --> 45:48.700
Fuckin' beautiful.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.600
Fuckin' tin-ass.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.100
Must be your shout, eh, bro?

45:55.300 --> 45:56.700
Yeah, all right, all right.

45:56.700 --> 45:57.700
Well, bloody hell.

45:57.700 --> 45:59.300
I should have brought
the video camera.

46:00.600 --> 46:01.900
Get out and stay out,

46:01.900 --> 46:04.000
you fucking bastard!

46:14.000 --> 46:15.400
Hey, Muss.

46:15.400 --> 46:18.100
Have a win on the Gigis, Muss?

46:19.500 --> 46:21.200
Look at the bloody
state of you, man.

46:21.800 --> 46:23.900
You're a fucking mess.

46:24.200 --> 46:26.900
Don't you ever speak
to me again, you hear?

46:26.900 --> 46:28.900
You might spoil my night.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.500
Good evening, ladies.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.500
I've just had a bit of a windfall,

46:34.300 --> 46:35.900
and since you're looking
so bloody beautiful,

46:35.900 --> 46:37.900
I thought I might buy
you gals a drink,

46:38.200 --> 46:39.000
especially the one
standing here

46:39.000 --> 46:41.300
in his fucking party dress.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Barman, 6 milk shakes, eh?

46:44.000 --> 46:46.100
Easy on the ice cream.

46:48.200 --> 46:49.300
Ooh. Forget it, lady.

46:49.300 --> 46:51.300
You looked better
before you turned around.

46:53.700 --> 46:55.200
Fuck, boy, you're too much.

46:55.200 --> 46:56.500
If you want to be
like your old man,

46:56.500 --> 46:59.100
learn how to stand
on your own two feet.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.500
Fuck. Is that your old man?

47:03.300 --> 47:06.000
Piss off.
I don't have an old man.

47:29.700 --> 47:33.000
You're still a bloody
attractive woman.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.400
You mean after you
take to me with your fists?

47:36.100 --> 47:38.000
You make me sick.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.100
Oh, hon, you still
on about the other week?

47:41.500 --> 47:43.800
I told you, I'm sorry.

47:43.800 --> 47:45.300
And I told you
when I get like that,

47:45.300 --> 47:47.100
get out of my way.

47:47.100 --> 47:49.700
But you have to get
all lippy on me.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.200
I got a temper on me,
but who hasn't?

47:53.200 --> 47:54.900
You're priceless.

47:55.400 --> 47:58.900
Well, at least I try
to make it up to you.

47:58.900 --> 48:00.400
Get off me, Jake.

48:01.800 --> 48:03.400
Oh, you're a hard lady.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.400
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

48:06.400 --> 48:08.000
Sit down and keep a man company.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.500
I've got things to think about.

48:10.800 --> 48:12.800
Like what?

48:12.800 --> 48:14.200
Since when were you interested?

48:14.700 --> 48:15.800
Well, if you can't tell

48:15.800 --> 48:17.400
by the way I just grabbed you,

48:17.400 --> 48:18.600
I must be losing my touch.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.500
If you're not gonna take me
seriously, Jake...

48:20.500 --> 48:23.200
Take it easy. Talk to Jakey.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.300
It's just...

48:33.300 --> 48:35.400
It's just what?

48:36.600 --> 48:38.500
Jeez, you're pretty.

48:46.700 --> 48:48.700
I want us to visit Boogie.

48:49.300 --> 48:51.300
Is that all?

48:52.000 --> 48:53.700
Go together, as a family.

48:54.900 --> 48:56.500
You know, make a day of it,

48:56.500 --> 48:58.500
take up a nice picnic lunch.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.800
Maybe we could rent
a car for the day.

49:00.800 --> 49:03.300
Oh, yeah. Maybe we could
fuckin' fly.

49:03.300 --> 49:04.700
It's not impossible, Jake.

49:05.400 --> 49:07.200
I've worked it out.

49:07.200 --> 49:10.100
There's the money Auntie Matawai
sent me at Christmas.

49:10.100 --> 49:11.600
If I put a bit aside each week

49:11.600 --> 49:13.500
from the housekeeping,

49:13.500 --> 49:16.600
in a month, maybe we could go.

49:16.600 --> 49:18.200
Please, Jake?

49:19.800 --> 49:21.900
And this whole day
means a lot to you, huh?

49:23.100 --> 49:24.800
Yes.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.500
Book the fuckin' limousine.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.800
Horses, babe.

49:37.200 --> 49:38.500
Honest.

49:43.800 --> 49:46.500
Now, will you come here?

49:53.100 --> 49:55.800
Tell Jakey you love him.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.900
That's the trouble,
Jake. I do.

50:11.200 --> 50:12.700
- What's going on?
- It's Heke, sir.

50:12.700 --> 50:14.800
He's got your taiaha, sir.

50:18.600 --> 50:19.600
If you want to smash things, boy,

50:19.600 --> 50:21.500
you start with me!

50:24.000 --> 50:26.500
You think you're man enough
to hold a taiaha, boy?

50:26.500 --> 50:27.800
I hate this fucking place!

50:27.800 --> 50:29.800
You're not supposed to like it!

50:30.400 --> 50:32.500
Let me go, you black bastard!

50:33.000 --> 50:35.900
We are the same color, boy!

50:55.200 --> 50:56.000
The British used to think

50:56.000 --> 50:57.700
the bayonet was the most lethal

50:57.700 --> 51:00.300
of all hand-to-hand
combat weapons,

51:00.700 --> 51:03.300
till they came across our warriors,

51:03.300 --> 51:05.100
who fought with a taiaha.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.200
You think your fist
is your weapon?

51:14.900 --> 51:16.100
When I have taught you,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.100
your mind will be.

51:19.100 --> 51:22.300
You'll carry your
taiaha inside you.

51:27.500 --> 51:29.100
Come on.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.700
Whoa, this is the life, eh, kids?

51:34.700 --> 51:37.200
Don't even have to change gears.

52:03.900 --> 52:07.200
Want to come and visit
your brother, son?

52:07.900 --> 52:10.700
Nah. Got something else on.

52:10.700 --> 52:14.100
Oh, come on, son...
as a family.

52:16.200 --> 52:19.500
What? Too fucking busy
to visit your own brother, boy?

52:19.500 --> 52:22.000
Rather be with a pack of wankers.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.600
He would have come, Jake,

52:31.600 --> 52:33.700
if you would have waited.

52:33.700 --> 52:35.200
He would have.

52:39.800 --> 52:41.400
Visits don't start
till after lunch.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.100
We may as well take
a drive, eh, kids?

52:43.500 --> 52:46.000
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

52:56.700 --> 52:59.200
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

52:59.200 --> 53:01.800
What's the time?

53:01.800 --> 53:04.200
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

53:04.200 --> 53:06.700
What's the time?

53:06.700 --> 53:09.200
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

53:09.200 --> 53:11.700
What's the time?

53:11.700 --> 53:13.600
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

53:14.200 --> 53:15.300
What's the time?

53:16.100 --> 53:17.500
I said 1:00

53:17.500 --> 53:18.700
2:00

53:18.700 --> 53:19.900
3:00

53:19.900 --> 53:21.100
4:00

53:21.100 --> 53:22.400
5:00

53:22.400 --> 53:23.800
6:00

53:23.800 --> 53:26.200
Spooly, spooly,
spooly ooly dooly booly

53:26.200 --> 53:27.200
7:00

53:27.200 --> 53:28.600
8:00

53:28.600 --> 53:30.900
9:00, widdly widdly widdly,
wee, wee, oh

53:31.900 --> 53:34.500
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

53:34.500 --> 53:36.300
What's the time?

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?

53:47.300 --> 53:49.400
What's that place over there, Mum?

53:49.400 --> 53:51.700
Taku Whenua Tuturu.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.100
My piece of dirt.

53:55.100 --> 53:57.300
That's where I was
brought up, kids.

53:57.600 --> 53:59.800
What's that big house
over there, Mum?

54:00.400 --> 54:02.300
That's the Wharenui.

54:02.300 --> 54:03.900
It was a lot different
when I was a girl.

54:04.800 --> 54:06.400
It was always impressive.

54:06.400 --> 54:08.400
What's impressive?

54:08.400 --> 54:09.800
Choice.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.900
It was always choice.

54:12.200 --> 54:13.200
And inside are the most

54:13.200 --> 54:15.100
choicest carvings.

54:17.800 --> 54:18.800
Go on, mum.

54:19.900 --> 54:21.000
Oh, and inside are photos

54:21.000 --> 54:22.600
of the old people

54:22.600 --> 54:24.200
and the Tukutuku panels.

54:24.600 --> 54:25.900
You know, I used to help Nannie

54:25.900 --> 54:28.800
and Auntie Matawai repair them.

54:28.800 --> 54:32.400
Well, why don't we
ever go there, Mum?

54:34.500 --> 54:36.700
One day we'll all end up there.

54:36.700 --> 54:38.300
See over there to the right?

54:38.300 --> 54:40.000
That's the Urupa...

54:40.000 --> 54:42.100
the family cemetery.

54:42.100 --> 54:45.100
All my family are buried there.

54:45.100 --> 54:47.300
I'd love to go and see them.

54:47.300 --> 54:50.500
Not before me, you don't.

54:52.400 --> 54:54.900
Your father and I
were going to get hitched there.

54:56.800 --> 54:58.800
Except we didn't.

55:00.700 --> 55:03.800
I wasn't bloody good enough...

55:05.300 --> 55:06.800
not for their royal highness.

55:06.800 --> 55:10.100
Tell them everything,
why don't you?

55:15.000 --> 55:17.200
Your mother was beautiful...

55:18.600 --> 55:20.800
pride of the fucking tribe...

55:23.500 --> 55:25.400
And this old black-ass comes along

55:25.400 --> 55:27.400
and steals her away.

55:28.100 --> 55:30.100
And you know where
I come from, kids?

55:31.100 --> 55:34.000
A long line of slaves.

55:39.300 --> 55:41.200
Fucking slaves.

55:43.900 --> 55:45.400
I'd like to see those wankers

55:45.400 --> 55:47.500
call Jake the Muss that now.

55:55.200 --> 55:58.200
Ah, this place gives me the creeps.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.200
Come on, kids.

56:02.700 --> 56:04.700
Doesn't give me the creeps.

56:04.700 --> 56:06.400
You never met my grandmother.

56:06.400 --> 56:07.800
Eh, Jake?

56:25.000 --> 56:26.200
Jake?

56:26.200 --> 56:27.600
Just want to show
our flash car to my mates.

56:29.300 --> 56:32.900
Whoa, bro, you know what
the penalty is for car theft?

56:37.100 --> 56:38.700
Just one beer, huh?

56:39.700 --> 56:41.600
One, Jake.

56:41.600 --> 56:43.100
Just the one.

56:43.100 --> 56:44.500
Promise?

56:46.400 --> 56:48.100
Cross my heart.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.100
Cheer.

56:54.700 --> 56:55.400
Cheer.

56:55.400 --> 56:56.600
Ah, cheer.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.400
Cheer, bro.

56:57.400 --> 56:58.900
Cheer.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.300
Cheer.

57:03.300 --> 57:05.200
How long is Dad gonna be?

57:06.000 --> 57:07.500
I'd get that tone out of your voice

57:07.500 --> 57:09.200
if I were you.

57:09.700 --> 57:11.200
How many times have
you seen your father

57:11.200 --> 57:12.900
like today, Grace?

57:12.900 --> 57:15.400
Never... that's how many,

57:15.400 --> 57:17.800
so just give him a chance, eh?

57:18.600 --> 57:19.800
Now running on the track,

57:19.800 --> 57:21.400
it's Robin the Fair...

57:22.300 --> 57:24.400
Bethie! Name your poison.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.400
Oh, no, thanks, Dooley.

57:26.400 --> 57:28.500
Jake and I are going to
visit our son Boogie.

57:28.500 --> 57:30.000
- Aren't we, Jake?
- Yeah, yeah. Just a minute.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.600
I'm trying to listen
to the horse race.

57:31.900 --> 57:32.700
You promised, Jake.

57:32.700 --> 57:33.400
Shut up, woman.

57:33.400 --> 57:35.600
You'll make me miss
who won the fuckin' race.

57:35.600 --> 57:36.900
The kids are hungry.

57:36.900 --> 57:37.600
Well, feed them.

57:37.600 --> 57:40.200
You got bootloads of the stuff.

57:40.500 --> 57:42.200
We'll be waiting.

57:43.500 --> 57:47.100
Come on, come on.
Come up, come up.

57:57.100 --> 57:58.600
So he's not coming?

57:59.000 --> 58:00.600
Oh, he's coming, all right.

58:01.500 --> 58:02.500
You're hopeful.

58:03.200 --> 58:04.500
No, Grace.

58:04.500 --> 58:07.000
It's just a woman's
lot, that's all.

58:07.800 --> 58:10.000
One day you'll understand.

58:47.800 --> 58:49.200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

58:49.200 --> 58:50.800
Stop, stop.

58:51.600 --> 58:53.500
It's good, but it's
not good enough!

58:53.800 --> 58:55.300
I've told you fellas
time and again,

58:55.300 --> 58:57.200
this haka won't work

58:57.200 --> 58:59.600
until you get the first action right!

59:01.600 --> 59:03.800
You're reaching up
for all these ancestral lines,

59:03.800 --> 59:06.800
and you're pulling them
down into your body!

59:07.700 --> 59:09.500
The weight of your ancestors.

59:10.400 --> 59:11.600
Some of you look
as though you're reaching

59:11.600 --> 59:13.900
for butterflies or something.

59:13.900 --> 59:15.700
Now, let's do it again...

59:17.200 --> 59:19.500
and wake up!

59:24.500 --> 59:27.500
And I in love

59:27.500 --> 59:32.400
So, darling, here is my heart

59:32.900 --> 59:34.100
Give me the keys, Jake.

59:35.100 --> 59:37.000
I said, give me the keys.

59:37.400 --> 59:38.200
What for?

59:38.200 --> 59:39.900
I'm going to visit Boogie.

59:39.900 --> 59:40.800
Bad idea.

59:41.400 --> 59:42.800
The problem is
you've spoiled the boy.

59:42.800 --> 59:43.700
You've got to toughen him up.

59:43.700 --> 59:45.600
Give me the bloody keys!

59:45.600 --> 59:47.100
That's it, woman. Just fuck off!

59:47.100 --> 59:48.700
Take a bloody taxi.

59:48.700 --> 59:51.200
You got all my bloody money.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.000
Fuck.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.000
I remember

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.800
All those yesterdays

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:17.900
Come on kids.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.000
We'll walk around
to the taxi stand.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.700
Taxi? What for?

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.100
We're going home.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.200
No. We're going to see Boogie.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.700
You promised.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.800
Please, Grace, try to understand.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.400
I don't want to listen
to any more of your lies.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.700
I hate you! I hate you both!

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.600
Come on, kids.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.900
Boogie? Son?

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.400
We were on our way.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.700
We rented a car for the trip.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.000
We had a bit of an accident, son.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.700
Oh, well, you know

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:12.400
what your father's like

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.700
when he gets behind the wheel.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.200
Had a picnic lunch all prepared.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.400
Stayed up all last night.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.500
I got in just what you like.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.700
It was just a stupid accident.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.800
Whoa. Party at my place tonight, boys.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.100
- Hello!
- Hey!

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.600
Fuck. I need to piss.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.900
Thanks, mate.

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:28.000
We really needed to know that.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.200
Bethie, you awake?

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.500
Come party with us.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.400
No.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.100
No more, Jake.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.600
I could tell straightaway

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.000
it was a holding.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.600
What's more, it's
my mate's holding.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.000
Next thing I know,
I give him a smack.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.800
Oh, if it isn't Gracie.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.000
Hu wanted some water.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Come and give your uncle a kiss.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.000
You're growing up fast, girl.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.100
Where's mum?

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.100
She's in bed, where you should be.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.000
What happened then, Jake?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.200
He comes back at me
with this crowbar.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.400
Yeah? And then what?

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.100
I take the crowbar off him

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.000
and give him another smack.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.300
Good night, Hu.

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.000
Night-night.

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.500
Shh. Shh. It's OK, Gracie.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.000
Uncle Bully is going
to be gentle with you...

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.500
as gentle as a lamb.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.700
Shh.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.300
Shh. Shh.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.900
Your mum and dad are going to be

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.200
real angry at you,

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.100
turning me on like that...

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:33.100
coming downstairs in nothing

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.200
but that flimsy little nightie.

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.700
Shh, shh, shh.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.100
It's our secret, hey, Gracie?

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.600
You hear me, girl?

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.400
Keep your mouth shut.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.200
Did Huata wet the bed again, Bub?

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.900
You should have left it.
I'd have done that.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.900
Just go away.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.300
Go away.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.900
Look, I don't blame you, Grace.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.600
I wanted to see Boogie

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.000
as much as you.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.400
You don't care about any of us.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.600
That's not true.
I love you all.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.100
But you're a liar!

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.200
Go on...

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.100
got your period, Bub.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.600
It's bound to make you
a bit uptight...

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.700
Get out! Get out!

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.000
What's for breakfast?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.600
You want something to eat,

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.399
fix it yourself.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:40.000
Give me a coffee.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Go and have a wash, Jake.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.899
Clean your ears out
while you're at it.

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.899
What the fuck's up with you?

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:52.100
I'm not going to
take this anymore.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.899
Do you hear me, Jake Heke?

01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:56.100
No more.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.300
We never got to see Boogie.

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:02.800
I don't want any more
of these drunken parties

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.100
or your bloody ugly
mongrel mates coming around.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.800
It's no good...

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.100
no good for the kids,

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.800
especially now Grace is growing.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.600
Who the fuck do you
think you are, eh?

01:09:19.899 --> 01:09:22.399
Sitting there like
Lady Bloody Muck,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.899
telling me in my own house

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:27.399
who I can and can't have here.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.200
Well, I've asked
them back tonight,

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.500
and you'd better be ready for it.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.100
Do you hear me?!

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:35.600
Now, get off your fat ass

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.000
and get busy.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.500
Oh, Grace!

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.700
Leave that kid alone!
You know, that's your problem.

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:41.800
You spoil the lot of them!

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.700
No wonder they're all
so fucking screwed up!

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.300
It's got nothing to do with you,

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.300
eh, Jake Heke?

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.300
You're such good father material!

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.600
You chased Nig off!

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.800
You couldn't give a damn
about Boogie!

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.600
You're not gonna
hurt my babies anymore...

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:05.800
not while I can do
something about it.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.500
Oh, you want something to eat?

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.400
Learn how to cook.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.400
Grace!

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:18.200
Grace!

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.600
What's up?

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.600
What?

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.300
I said, what's up?

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.000
How long have you
been sitting there?

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.000
Why is everything so black, Toot?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.200
Don't know.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.400
Maybe 'cause we're all bloody Maoris.

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:03.900
You got something...

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.800
you got something to sniff?

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:08.300
Yeah. A couple of old socks.

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.300
What's going on, G?

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.300
I thought you said
we were best friends.

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.000
If you're too bloody mean,
just forget it.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.100
Hang on. Hang on.

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.500
No glue, OK? OK?

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.300
But I've got some dope.

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.000
You want some of that?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.100
Ya.

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.400
What's going on with you, Bub?

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.900
What colors are you seeing now, G?

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.400
Still all black?

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.500
Not an old black in sight.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.200
Notice how you never see black
in a rainbow, do you?

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.100
Just bright colors.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.700
Must be their pot.

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:13.600
You know, the pot at
the end of the thing.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.900
Oh, dumb.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.500
Pot... the end of the thing.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.700
You're shit!

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.300
You're just like
everyone else around here.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.000
I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.100
You're just a stupid kid

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:34.100
that lives in an old wreck of a car.

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.300
G! G! Come back, G!

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.700
G, come back! What did I do?

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.200
Please, G!

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.000
I'm sorry!

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.500
Please.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.500
This is the day
that the Lord has made

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.300
That the Lord has made

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.400
We will rejoice

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.800
We will rejoice and be glad in it

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.500
And be glad in it

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.500
Whoa, for this is the day

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.900
That the Lord has made

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:11.600
We will rejoice and be glad in it

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.200
This is the day, this is the day

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:18.800
That the Lord has made

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.800
This is the day
that the Lord has made

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.800
That the Lord has made

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.000
We will rejoice

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.300
We will rejoice and be glad in it

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.100
And be glad in it

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.900
This is the day

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.000
That the Lord has made

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:40.300
We will rejoice and be glad in it

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:44.000
This is the day, this is the day

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.800
That the Lord has made

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:24.600
Shit. It's nearly on empty.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.700
I've got money.

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:27.900
Forget the money. It's just no good.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.700
We've been driving around for hours.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
When was the last time
you phoned home?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Uh, about 9:00.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.100
Jeez. It's nearly 11:00.

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:38.000
I've got those

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely blues

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.600
Lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely blues

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.000
I've got those

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.100
Lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely blues

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:01.100
Lonely, lonely blues

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:07.100
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.700
- Bring your ass in here, girl!
- Look what she done...

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.900
I said in here! Move!

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.000
Your mother's been out

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.600
all day, half the fucking night!

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.400
Now, where the fuck you been?

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.900
Come on, bro, she's home now.

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.900
Let the kid go to bed.

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:29.200
Come on, Jake.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.600
Play the guitar, man.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.800
Go on. Piss off to bed.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.500
Hey, come on, give your Uncle Bully

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.600
a kiss good night.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.500
I don't want to.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.700
What? I didn't hear you.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.400
I said I don't want to.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.400
What, you got
a hearing problem, girl?

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.500
Hey, no. Leave it.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.200
Daddy, no!

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.600
Daddy!

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.700
I told you about this thing, eh?

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.500
No fucking wonder you don't do
what you're fucking told!

01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.200
Take it easy, Jake.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.100
She's just a kid.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.400
Fuck! Get out of here!

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.500
Bully, play us a song.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.800
Go on, dude.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.200
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.700
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.700
Look what she done...

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.800
Where is she?

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.500
Stop your panic, woman.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.600
She's home.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.800
She won't be taking off anymore.

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.300
Where is she, Jake?

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:52.500
She pissed off out the back.

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:00.200
What the fuck?

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.500
Aah! Aah! Oh! Oh!

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:13.000
Some-someone help me
get her down!

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.100
Please! Please!

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.200
Come on, baby. Come on, girl.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.000
It's all right, baby.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.300
Mummy's home. Mummy's home.

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:29.700
Come on, Grace. Oh, God.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.500
We've got to do something.

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.100
Jake!

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.400
My baby!

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:47.900
I'll get help.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:04.100
No, Grace!

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.800
Don't cry, Mavis.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.900
Doesn't do any good.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.000
Auntie Matawai?

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.400
It's Beth.

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.100
Ka mata oku tamahine...

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:52.600
last night.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.200
I want to bring her home, Auntie.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.700
Will you come and get us, please?

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.300
Thank you.

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.000
We're going to play spacies.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.500
Come on, you two.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.600
Oh, where's Gracie?

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.200
She's having a long sleep.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.500
No, she's not. Her bed's empty.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:23.900
That's enough, Polly. Come on.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.100
What the fuck's going on here?

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:36.400
I want us to take Grace back home

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.400
to the Marae.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.200
This is her fucking home.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.600
No, it's not.

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.500
This was never her home...

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.200
never.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.400
And that fucking place is?

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.700
Fucking Maoris who think they're better

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:54.800
than the rest of us?

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.000
I hate them.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:01.100
Bastards living in the fucking past.

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.500
It's our past, too, Jake.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:05.200
What's that supposed to mean?

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:09.200
I want Grace to be with her people.

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.800
We should have gone back
a long time ago.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.900
Fuck off!

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:15.400
You're not taking her anywhere.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:19.300
I'm taking her, Jake,
with or without you.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.900
I wasn't there
when Grace needed me.

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:23.900
This time I'm going to do

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.500
the right thing by her,

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.000
and you're not going to stop me.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.200
You fucking do,

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.100
and I won't be here
when you get back.

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.700
Well, go on, then.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.500
Go! Get the hell out of here!

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.700
I'm taking her.

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:41.200
I'll kill you first!

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.900
Well, go on. Do it.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.400
You're still a slave, Jake...

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.500
to your fists, to the drink,

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:54.600
to yourself.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:56.900
Well, go on.

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.800
Kill the bloody lot of us!

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:12.200
Stay out of my fucking way...

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.500
or I'll kill you.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.600
You've come home, Grace.
We're home.

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.300
Oh, my baby.

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.700
Am I that much of a bastard, eh?

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.300
You're my mates. You tell me.

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:51.800
It's not too late
if you want to go to the Tangi.

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.200
We'll drive you.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.000
Fuck off.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.200
I'm not going to give them
the satisfaction.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.300
I was never fucking good enough,

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.300
not for their Beth.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.300
I'll knock her bloody head in.

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:07.400
Never mind, bro.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.500
What's the key to her, man?

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.900
You think I was tough on the kid?

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:15.500
Na... it wouldn't have been
just that, mate.

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.900
Bull, what do you think?

01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:20.000
You think I was tough on her?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.500
Fucked if I know, bro.

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:27.300
I'll try and tell you
a story, eh, Gracie?

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.000
The story about a young girl

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.900
growing up in this beautiful place.

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.400
She was given an honor.

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.700
She was made Puhi of the Marae.

01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.800
The special one.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.900
Well, you see, the girl fell in love,

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:55.200
as all young people do.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.200
But you see, the problem was...

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:04.400
the old people
wouldn't agree to the fella.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.800
The girl, being headstrong,

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.600
went with him anyway.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.500
Her father said she'd be back...

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.400
that when everything
went to hell, she'd be back.

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:26.000
So the girl...
made a promise to herself

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.700
and said she wouldn't.

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:34.700
No matter what, she wouldn't.

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.900
You see, Grace...

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:43.200
I did know how to keep a promise.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.200
I did.

01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:48.800
I'm so sorry, Bub.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.100
I'm so sorry.

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:56.300
I should have been
there for you, sis.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:02.500
You were always there for us.

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.700
Oh, son.

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.600
Hey, G.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.000
Best friends... forever.

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.600
Remember?

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.400
That's all I meant. Honest.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.400
But you were right.

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.500
I'm just a stupid kid

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.400
who lives in an old wreck of a car.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.800
She loved you, man.

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.000
She loved you.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.300
What's the time?

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:02.700
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:05.500
What's the time? Say, it's 1:00

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.400
Have you ever seen so much piss?

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.600
That's because they love you, man.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.300
Yeah.

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:14.700
Yeah. Why not?

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:16.800
I'm a lovable chap.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.400
Jake the Muss.

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.600
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.100
Ohh ohh

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:26.900
There's Mr. Daddy-Longlegs

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:29.600
Crawling onto the ceiling

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.200
The sun don't shine,
the sun don't shine

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.200
The sun don't shine...

01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:59.200
Where the fuck are you?!

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.600
You bastard!

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:42.800
Fucking bastard.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.300
Don't forget your hat, eh, uncle?

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.800
Hey, uncle, did you
get all the ghosts?

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.200
I sure did.

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:02.000
Got the whole lot of them.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
You come and stay.
Bring the kids with you.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.200
We've got a lot of work
to do back home.

01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:30.100
And here, too, auntie.

01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:32.200
You sort out here first.

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:46.600
Be strong.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:51.400
Good-bye, auntie.

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.600
You made me real proud today, son.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Me, too, eh, Mum?
I made you proud today.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.900
You sure did, Bub.

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:16.300
Well, I suppose I'd better
be taking off, then.

01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:18.500
Take off? Where to?

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.200
I don't know.
Probably back to my car.

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.500
I like it there.

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:26.400
Well, do you think
you could like it here, with us?

01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:29.200
Because we like having you.

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:30.400
Don't we, kids?

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.500
Ya!

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:35.400
Well, whatever you say, Mrs. H.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:38.500
I mean, if you need me,
that'll be great.

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.400
I do need you.

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.400
Need you all.

01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.000
Well, we'll say grace.

01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:02.500
Grace!

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.900
Thank you for my family,

01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:15.700
and thank you for the food. Amen.

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.700
Good look, bro.

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.500
Would you like one, bro?

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:35.200
No, thanks, man.
I wear mine on the inside.

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:48.000
Don't you think you should
take the car back, son?

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.100
In the morning.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.100
Your mates did you proud today.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.100
There.

01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:01.700
Mrs. H, could you read me
one of G's stories?

01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:03.900
I can't. That's why she reads to me.

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:05.100
I mean used to.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.900
Yeah, the one about the Taniwha.

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:08.200
OK.

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:46.800
What's wrong, Mum?

01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:51.400
Toot, put the kids in the car.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.100
Thanks, bro.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.700
Same place... same fucking place
same thing happed with me.

01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:03.400
Anyway, this fucking ape
comes over to me,

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:06.600
takes off his shades,
and says the classic line.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.900
The classic line! Wait for it.

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:11.100
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.100
"What the fuck you staring at, man?"

01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:16.800
So I say to him, cool-ass,

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.600
"Well, not you, mate.
Your spunky missis. "

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.900
Trouble is, she was
fucking uglier than him.

01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:27.400
- Then all hell broke loose.
- Old Jimmy, eh?

01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:31.400
Hey, you can stay at
my place tonight, mate.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.100
Yeah, fuck it. Why not?

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:38.500
Beth! Bully, give the lady a seat.

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.800
You fucking animal.

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.300
What the fuck?

01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:46.200
Women and children, eh?
You fucking coward!

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.700
Please, control your
missis there, mate.

01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:51.200
Who the fuck do you think you are

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.300
coming in here
mouthing off at my mates?

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:54.500
Get the fucking hell out of here

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.100
before I kick your bloody head in.

01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:58.100
That's always your
answer, eh, Jake?

01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.400
Violence.

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:02.100
It's bad enough that you did it here,

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.500
but you brought it home with you

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.400
and I damn well let you.

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.900
What the fuck are you on about now?

01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:10.600
It was violence
that killed my Grace.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.200
She didn't have an ounce
of violence in her, Jake,

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.400
but we made damn sure
it was all around her.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:16.700
She killed herself!

01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.000
You bloody bastard!

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.200
It was your bloody mate

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.800
who handed her the rope!

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.000
Hey, I don't have a clue
what you're on about.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.600
- You fucking child...
- Shut up, Nig!

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:28.600
You animal.

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:31.100
You raped a 13-year-old girl,

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.100
then sat here drinking
with her father

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:35.000
while the rest of us buried her.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.600
She's off her fucking head, man.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.000
Sneaking around my house

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.600
and laying your dirty, filthy,

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.500
fucking hands on my baby!

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.400
My Grace!

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.900
Hey, you're not
on the fucking Marae now,

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:48.200
so don't come in here
accusing my mates of shit!

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.400
Hey, come on, man.

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.900
Look, no one's thinking straight.

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:54.400
We're family. Right?

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:57.600
Beth. Sit down. Have a drink.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:00.600
I won't drink with
you fucking animals!

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.500
Read it.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.700
Uncle Bully.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.800
Uncle fucking Bully!

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:18.600
Let's go, son.

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.000
You dumb bastard, Bully!

01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:38.800
Fuck you, Beth. Where are you going?

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.100
I found something better, Jake,

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:50.300
and I'm going to make damn sure
my kids have it all.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:51.900
From now on,

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:55.200
I make the decisions for my family.

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.700
Fuck off, then!

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.600
You'll get nothing from me.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.200
You've got nothing I want.

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.200
Our people once were warriors,

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:09.300
but not like you, Jake.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:13.100
They were a people
with mana, pride.

01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:14.600
People with spirit.

01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:18.100
If my spirit can survive

01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:20.400
living with you for 18 years,

01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:23.100
then I can survive anything.

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.800
Maybe you taught me that.

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.800
Oh, you are fucked, lady!
Really fucked!

01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:35.000
You think I need you
and your fucking spirit?

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.900
Fuck off! Go on, go!

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:39.800
I don't want you, ever!

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.100
I'll knock your fucking head off!

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:46.000
Fuck you! You'll be back.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.700
Fuck this warrior shit.

01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:50.000
You'll be back!

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.600
Fuck you, Beth!

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.700
Do you hear me, Beth?!

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.300
Fuck you!

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.800
Where are we going, Mum?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.200
We're going home.

01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:10.600
Oh, fuck all that
fucking warrior shit!

01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:14.600
You'll be back! You'll fucking see.

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:17.600
You'll need me!
You'll fucking want me!
