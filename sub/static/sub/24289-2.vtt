00:21.772 --> 00:23.815
Accessing mainframe database.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.068
Could be something useful in here, yes.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.361
Useful.

00:27.861 --> 00:28.862
Deployable.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.866
Ah, there it is.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.202
Yes, this will work perfectly.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.264
Re-animation complete.

01:02.688 --> 01:04.230
What?

01:04.313 --> 01:06.275
Where... am I?

01:06.358 --> 01:08.193
Initiating upgrade.

01:17.703 --> 01:18.537
Where's Vera?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.372
She was a no-show last period.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.999
Consider yourself lucky.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.168
I had her third period
and it was exhausting.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.380
She asks a lot of questions.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.967
Yeah, but she also knows so many answers.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.094
I have an idea where she might be.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.721
Come on.

01:37.848 --> 01:38.848
Vera?

01:39.141 --> 01:40.392
What have you done?

01:43.478 --> 01:45.605
I realized my original clothing
was not current,

01:45.689 --> 01:47.441
so I bio-constructed a new outfit

01:47.524 --> 01:51.153
based on the most searched
fashion trends for teenagers.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.614
Okay.

01:53.697 --> 01:54.697
So you and I are going

01:54.740 --> 01:57.367
to have to talk about mixing and matching.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.786
I think it totally works.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.581
Yeah, well, your clothes aren't the point.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.458
You can't go skipping class, Vera.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.877
Even if it is uninteresting or irrelevant?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.378
Welcome to high school.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.923
Just don't miss again, okay?

02:12.424 --> 02:14.343
You gotta find a better way to fit in.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.719
Keep a low profile

02:15.802 --> 02:18.096
until we've got this whole
guardian thing figured out.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.181
But it's so clear.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.184
You are next generation guardians.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.811
The first humans to defend cyberspace.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.783
While the appearance
of dark code caused me

02:26.813 --> 02:29.024
to activate you earlier than anticipated,

02:29.107 --> 02:32.861
each of you had been pre-selected
for your exceptional skills.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.906
Tamra, for your stealth agility.

02:36.239 --> 02:39.326
Trey, for your physical strength.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.120
Parker, for your intellect.

02:42.204 --> 02:45.332
And Austin, for your leadership.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.834
Leadership?

02:47.918 --> 02:48.960
Him?

02:49.795 --> 02:51.671
That is what I was programmed to know.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.673
I make no judgments.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.342
Obviously.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.803
Gee, thanks, Trey.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.514
I really appreciate the vote
of confidence.

03:02.391 --> 03:03.850
You have nothing to worry about.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.060
I pass.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.478
Vector out.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.109
Hey, dude.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.026
Dude!

03:13.110 --> 03:13.944
Wait up!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.737
Austin!

03:15.821 --> 03:17.114
What's the deal?

03:19.658 --> 03:21.076
The deal is no deal.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.245
I m out, like I said.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.166
But this is the coolest thing
that's ever happened to us.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.252
I don't get it, what changed?

03:31.920 --> 03:34.005
Come on, Parker.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.882
Leadership?

03:35.966 --> 03:37.134
Seriously?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.470
Leaders are supposed to follow the rules,

03:40.554 --> 03:42.389
do the right thing and make plans.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.099
Does that sound like me?

03:48.019 --> 03:49.980
I rest my case.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.273
So that's it?

03:51.648 --> 03:53.400
You're walking away?

03:53.483 --> 03:55.360
You catch on fast.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.613
Done.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.161
But I m not done, oh no.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.621
Not done yet.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.880
Hmm.

04:14.963 --> 04:19.176
It seems as I have been
digitally enhanced.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.894
Impressive.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.981
Now, to corrupt and conquer.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.710
How strange.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.214
What matter of sorcery is this?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.385
Intriguing.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.929
<i>Megabyte.</i>

05:04.012 --> 05:04.846
What?

05:04.930 --> 05:06.389
<i>I have a job for you.</i>

05:06.473 --> 05:08.433
<i>Something I need done.</i>

05:08.517 --> 05:09.643
<i>A task.</i>

05:09.726 --> 05:10.811
<i>An assignment.</i>

05:10.894 --> 05:12.020
Not even a hello?

05:12.103 --> 05:13.522
Welcome back?

05:13.605 --> 05:14.981
Manners, manners.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.775
<i>Stupid virus.</i>

05:16.858 --> 05:18.276
<i>There's no time for chit chat.</i>

05:18.360 --> 05:19.778
Chitter chatter.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.530
You have work to do.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.407
Forgive me, but I appear
to have been dormant

05:24.491 --> 05:26.535
a great many cycles.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.495
Is this about Bob?

05:28.578 --> 05:29.578
<i>Who's Bob?</i>

05:29.621 --> 05:31.706
What's Bob?

05:31.790 --> 05:32.934
I'm the one who brought you back.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.376
I call the shots.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.503
I do no user's bidding!

05:36.586 --> 05:38.672
You'll do mine!

05:38.755 --> 05:40.215
Oh, yes.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.841
You'll do mine.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.426
Or else.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.723
What is this?

05:48.807 --> 05:51.226
Delete code I built into your programming.

05:51.309 --> 05:52.477
I control it.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.979
I control you.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.941
Enough! Stop!

05:58.024 --> 05:59.234
Stop!

06:04.322 --> 06:05.991
You are truly evil.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.326
A fine trait in a partner.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.911
Partner?

06:09.995 --> 06:11.538
No.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.747
Let me get this straight.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.708
I'll be very clear.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.418
We are not partners.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.671
We will never be partners.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.007
You do as I say.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.633
If you do it right,

06:23.717 --> 06:25.927
<i>then maybe I'll remove the delete code.</i>

06:26.011 --> 06:27.178
<i>Understood?</i>

06:27.262 --> 06:29.222
Very well.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.766
I enjoy a challenge.

06:31.850 --> 06:35.186
Your wish is my command.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.772
For now.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.985
Hey.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.612
Hey, mom.

06:43.695 --> 06:44.821
Well?

06:47.365 --> 06:48.366
Well, what?

06:48.450 --> 06:50.076
Oh, Austin. I m dying to know.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.786
How was your first day at school?

06:51.870 --> 06:52.912
It was okay. Uh...

06:54.080 --> 06:56.541
Just a lot to take in.

06:56.625 --> 06:57.667
What's with the bin?

06:58.126 --> 06:59.919
Oh, I'm uh, getting the guest room ready

07:00.003 --> 07:01.981
for the exchange student who's
going to be staying with us.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.131
Did you meet him?

07:03.590 --> 07:04.633
No.

07:04.716 --> 07:08.053
Maybe he got stuck in some
weird alternate dimension.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.930
It wouldn't be the first time today.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.103
Removing a pathetic cyber patch.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.356
Such a waste of my talent.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.405
Hmm.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.122
Hmm.

07:36.206 --> 07:39.668
I may have underestimated this task.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.379
Cyber patch under attack.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.381
Message mode initiated.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.468
Guardian alert sent.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.561
So, how did your first day rate
on the Lame-O-Meter?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.273
Uh, yeah.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.234
It was pretty good.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.920
Ugh, sorry, I left something in my locker.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.529
I'll see you tomorrow.

08:13.076 --> 08:13.994
A text?

08:14.077 --> 08:15.161
From Vera?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.791
Oh, crap.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.390
An unknown virus is attacking
the cyber patch

08:36.474 --> 08:38.018
you installed this morning.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.102
You must return there
and prevent more dark code

08:40.186 --> 08:42.813
cyberlocusts from entering.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.983
Where are the cyberlocusts coming from?

08:45.066 --> 08:47.736
I have not been able to
determine their origin,

08:47.819 --> 08:49.612
but you must stop them.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.118
Okay, let's do it.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.413
Wait a minute.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.540
We're just gonna rush back in?

09:00.623 --> 09:02.101
I thought we could get hurt in there.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.001
Correct.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.294
Based on your skill level,

09:04.377 --> 09:07.589
there is a 16% chance of that occurring.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.841
I'll take those odds.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.760
What about Austin?

09:11.843 --> 09:14.804
He has not responded and
this mission cannot be delayed.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.431
The cyber patch breech could result

09:16.514 --> 09:19.350
in another massive power outage.

09:19.434 --> 09:22.270
Hey, it's okay.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.354
We got this.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.500
Man, I really don't like that part.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.852
I'll talk to Vera about putting barf bags

09:44.876 --> 09:45.919
in the Codec for you.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.462
Very funny, Googz.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.882
Hey, unnecessary.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.431
<i>Cyber patch strength at 70 percent.</i>

09:58.515 --> 09:59.516
Okay, guys.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.143
We have to find the virus
that's attacking the patch.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.108
Well, well.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.110
What have we here?

10:10.193 --> 10:11.027
We're the guardians.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.529
Defenders of cyberspace.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.114
Guardians?

10:14.197 --> 10:17.158
You don't look like guardians to me.

10:17.242 --> 10:20.829
Nevertheless, destroying you
will be most gratifying!

10:32.298 --> 10:34.134
Hey, Dad.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.636
Big day today.

10:36.719 --> 10:40.598
But, if you're looking down
on me like mom says,

10:40.682 --> 10:42.433
you already know.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.232
I mean, at that school people
expect a lot.

10:50.233 --> 10:55.613
You always said I was smart,
but Alan Turing High smart?

11:00.451 --> 11:02.704
And then there's this guardian thing.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.622
Parker's into it.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.458
Tamra and Trey are too, I guess.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.920
But Vera says I m supposed
to be the leader.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.174
I just don't feel like that's me.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.053
I mean, what if I fail?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.974
Somebody could get hurt.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.934
Or worse.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.522
I just can't lose anybody else.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.371
"Do what is right,

11:45.455 --> 11:47.498
and you will do no wrong."

11:51.336 --> 11:52.712
Guardians.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.381
You are no match for me.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.883
Who are you, anyway?

11:56.966 --> 11:59.969
I am Megabyte.

12:00.053 --> 12:00.970
Megabyte?

12:01.054 --> 12:04.515
So my phone's, what, 30,000
times more powerful than you?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.810
Aren't you the comedian.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.063
Can your phone do this?

12:11.689 --> 12:13.858
Hey, why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

12:13.942 --> 12:15.526
Or... closer to it.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.403
Bashtagger.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.868
Keep him busy, D-Frag!

12:23.952 --> 12:25.286
I'll go patch that patch.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.537
Yeah, get to it.

12:26.621 --> 12:27.872
I'll keep Mega...

12:27.956 --> 12:29.624
You can't do that to my friends!

12:29.707 --> 12:31.125
Energy Shuriken!

12:33.628 --> 12:34.963
Hmm.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.676
Okay, Megaplant ready for round two?

12:41.469 --> 12:42.595
Always ready!

12:49.769 --> 12:50.603
Huh?

12:50.687 --> 12:53.606
Where do you think you're going,
little guardian?

12:54.148 --> 12:55.608
Whoa!

12:55.692 --> 12:56.734
Googz!

12:58.194 --> 12:59.529
Nice catch.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.447
Now where was I?

13:07.662 --> 13:08.955
Hyah!

13:16.129 --> 13:17.046
There it is.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.047
It's open again.

13:18.131 --> 13:18.965
Finally.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.051
Now, to finish what I started
and shut down electrical power.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.432
<i>Cyber patch strength at 0 percent.</i>

13:27.598 --> 13:28.433
No kidding.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.559
Fright fist!

13:40.987 --> 13:43.948
Your response time is unacceptable.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.491
I'll work on it.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.993
What's the sitch?

13:47.076 --> 13:49.328
The dark code cyberlocusts
have breached the patch

13:49.412 --> 13:51.164
you installed this morning.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.332
This is the visual from the Codec.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.918
Whoa. What is that?

13:56.002 --> 13:58.212
A very destructive virus called Megabyte

13:58.296 --> 14:00.381
responsible for the breech.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.592
You need to help Googz, Enigma, and D-Frag

14:02.675 --> 14:05.970
stop the cyberlocusts
and destroy this Megabyte.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.641
Okay. I have an idea.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.311
Can you reverse the programming
on my code disruptor?

14:13.811 --> 14:15.396
Make it seal instead of frag?

14:16.189 --> 14:19.275
Yes, that's possible.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.502
But you will not have access to it

14:20.526 --> 14:22.153
while the change is in progress.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.533
Just, uh... start coding.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.299
Your efforts are futile, guardians.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.511
The three of you don't stand a chance.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.595
Count again.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.305
There's four of us.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.475
One more guardian
hardly makes a difference.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.771
I thought you were out.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.398
Well, I m back in.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.150
Guys, we have
to stop the cyberlocusts

15:01.275 --> 15:03.027
before they take out the power core.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.862
Right. Let's move!

15:06.989 --> 15:08.741
Run, guardians, run!

15:08.825 --> 15:10.076
<i>Megabyte.</i>

15:10.159 --> 15:11.661
<i>You lazy virus.</i>

15:11.744 --> 15:13.162
I detect interference.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.415
Make yourself useful and stop it.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.125
Very well.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.764
Now it's time to meet
your demise, guardians!

15:39.564 --> 15:41.023
Guys, look out!

15:42.650 --> 15:43.651
On it!

15:44.485 --> 15:45.486
Whoa!

15:52.201 --> 15:53.202
Whoa!

15:55.455 --> 15:57.373
Going down.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.458
Whoa!

16:00.710 --> 16:01.544
Oh, hey.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.671
I think I m getting the hang of this.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.798
Style points for the landing, D-Frag.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.633
You guys keep fragging cyberlocusts.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.343
I'll take Megacreeper.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.437
Hey, virus!

16:20.688 --> 16:22.398
You dare challenge me?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.650
How amusing.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.654
You're gonna have to do better than that.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.657
That was close.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.661
That was closer!

16:39.624 --> 16:40.500
Hey, Vera.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.436
How's that adjustment on
my code disruptor coming?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.170
I have installed the cyber sealer function

16:44.253 --> 16:46.088
to your code disruptor.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.798
It is uploading now.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.759
Okay. Just hurry!

16:53.137 --> 16:54.347
Here we go.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.098
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

16:59.352 --> 17:00.269
Whoa!

17:00.353 --> 17:01.854
That was way too close.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.234
You can't outrun me!

17:07.318 --> 17:08.611
Try flying blind.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.195
Booster pack!

17:11.239 --> 17:12.323
Whoa!

17:13.991 --> 17:15.492
Argh!

17:17.036 --> 17:18.496
Yeah!

17:18.579 --> 17:19.765
Were kind of outnumbered.

17:19.789 --> 17:20.998
Just keep fragging.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.041
We really could use some help.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.045
Vera, I need that cyber sealer now!

17:26.127 --> 17:28.589
Cyber sealer upload at 98%.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.716
It will be ready in five seconds.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.676
Okay.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.427
I better buy some time.

17:33.511 --> 17:34.637
Blink!

17:45.022 --> 17:45.856
Finally.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.233
Cyber Sealer!

17:56.117 --> 17:57.410
Today's forecast,

17:57.493 --> 18:00.037
cloudy with a chance of bug guts.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.831
Get off! Get off me!

18:01.914 --> 18:02.748
Googz!

18:02.832 --> 18:03.832
Get off!

18:05.918 --> 18:06.752
Oh, hi guys.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.337
I totally had that.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.798
Right. Totally.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.677
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.012
It can't be.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.597
Impossible.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.116
So that was kind of phenomenal.

18:19.140 --> 18:19.974
Yeah.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.310
I could do without the last
minute save stuff.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.894
But in the end you came through.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.480
I don't walk away from my friends.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.274
Spoken like a true leader.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.067
Baby steps, dude.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.528
Hey, what happened
to Megabyte, anyway?

18:32.612 --> 18:35.906
Crashed his giant
cyber locust and went boom.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.074
Nice.

18:41.120 --> 18:45.750
This is far from over, guardians.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.466
And my code disruptor's back to normal.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.843
And she figured out a way
to give us all cyber sealers.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.845
That's so amazing.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.639
She's so amazing.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.726
You don't think there's, like, a way...

19:04.143 --> 19:05.269
Me and her could...

19:05.353 --> 19:07.605
Uh, no, Parker.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.107
Don't even go there.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.192
Hey, Austin.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.527
Parker, nice to see you.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.446
Did you enjoy your first day at school?

19:15.529 --> 19:17.156
Definitely, it was incredible.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.660
Vera?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.496
Hello, Austin.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.789
Hello, Parker.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.043
Good, you've already met.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.170
What're you doing here, Vera?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.422
Vera's our new exchange student.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.841
I thought I was getting a
Hungarian boy named Gunther,

19:35.925 --> 19:38.511
but the school emailed
the last minute change.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.931
This is a good way to fit in.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.266
Don't you agree?

19:44.350 --> 19:46.852
Yeah, it sounds great to me.

19:46.936 --> 19:50.815
And since Vera is a girl
and not a Gunther,

19:50.898 --> 19:52.626
I thought I would add some
extra little touches

19:52.650 --> 19:55.319
to the guest room like flowers.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.071
I don't require flowers.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.739
Or a guest room.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.885
This room right here will serve my needs.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.743
No!

20:02.827 --> 20:03.827
No, no, no, no, no.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.831
The guest room will be just fine.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.600
You know, it'll be nice
to have another girl

20:08.624 --> 20:10.292
in the house for once.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.044
Come on, I'll show you your room.

20:27.685 --> 20:28.853
Useless.

20:28.936 --> 20:29.770
Bootless.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.188
You failed, Megabyte.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.398
Did I?

20:32.481 --> 20:35.317
Your cyberlocusts were given access.

20:35.401 --> 20:38.696
Is it my fault those dreadful
guardians got in the way?

20:38.779 --> 20:41.031
Guardians.

20:41.115 --> 20:44.910
Is that the code that kept interfering?

20:45.745 --> 20:46.829
Guardian code.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.080
Yes, yes.

20:48.164 --> 20:51.125
It's just a new version of an old nemesis.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.627
<i>But you couldn't stop it.</i>

20:53.711 --> 20:55.004
It stopped you.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.047
Wrong outcome.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.008
Oh, please.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.343
It was a mere sub-routine.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.596
I m just getting warmed up.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.806
<i>No excuses, Megabyte.</i>

21:05.890 --> 21:07.433
<i>I don't want excuses,</i>

21:07.516 --> 21:10.561
I don't like excuses.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.605
This guardian code

21:12.688 --> 21:15.649
must not stand in the way of my plans.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.818
<i>Eliminate it.</i>
