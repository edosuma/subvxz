WEBVTT

00:05.753 --> 00:07.022
Ooh, yeah.

00:09.163 --> 00:11.542
So yesterday, I'm at this garage sale,

00:11.624 --> 00:13.511
I look down, and there it was...

00:13.716 --> 00:16.689
the Darth Vader action figure
with the incredibly rare

00:16.866 --> 00:19.660
green... lightsaber.

00:21.018 --> 00:22.741
How have I not kicked your ass yet?

00:24.875 --> 00:26.293
- Fore!
- Whoa!

00:26.381 --> 00:27.808
- Watch out!
- Parking lot!

00:31.955 --> 00:33.294
Oh, it was just a pinto.

00:35.027 --> 00:35.342
Fez,

00:35.946 --> 00:36.970
this is putt-putt.

00:37.416 --> 00:38.729
Your choices are putt...

00:39.648 --> 00:40.304
or putt.

00:41.932 --> 00:42.457
Hey,

00:43.743 --> 00:44.714
what the hell?

00:45.870 --> 00:47.524
Oh, Forman.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.808
I should have known it was you guys.

00:49.913 --> 00:51.042
Most people that come here

00:51.147 --> 00:53.641
can't hit the ball that hard on account
of they're in kindergarten.

00:54.822 --> 00:55.452
Mitch,

00:55.688 --> 00:58.393
Congratulations. This seems like the
perfect job for someone your size,

00:58.431 --> 01:00.889
what with the free lodging
and the little castle on hole 6.

01:02.569 --> 01:04.732
Yeah, there's just enough room
in there for me and your mom.

01:06.034 --> 01:06.664
Ooh!

01:07.273 --> 01:09.899
Yeah, the sweetest burns
involve doing it with your mom.

01:13.020 --> 01:15.163
Look, just quit hitting the ball that hard,
or you guys are outta here.

01:15.310 --> 01:16.129
What are you... no.

01:18.082 --> 01:19.447
God, I hate that guy.

01:19.678 --> 01:21.358
Tear him a new hole-in-one.

01:22.871 --> 01:25.812
Wow, Forman, I haven't seen you this pissed since
I chased you around your house with that

01:25.874 --> 01:26.974
spider in a jar.

01:28.124 --> 01:30.407
You were like,
"Hyde, I swear to god!"

01:31.957 --> 01:33.224
Then you never did anything.

01:34.324 --> 01:35.007
Yeah?

01:35.474 --> 01:36.724
I'm about to do something.

Mitch, I'm so sorry.

02:30.145 --> 02:30.614
What?

02:32.645 --> 02:36.994
I've lost the ability to process language
on account of I have a concussion!

02:39.780 --> 02:41.101
Here's more bad news...

02:41.961 --> 02:45.008
when you return to the course,
you're gonna find that some punk

02:45.398 --> 02:48.471
drew boobs and a butt crack
on the clown statue.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.513
And don't try to wash it off
'cause I used permanent marker.

03:00.620 --> 03:02.364
Forman,
why are we always fighting?

03:02.963 --> 03:04.630
I can't even remember
how we got this way.

03:04.969 --> 03:06.375
I think a chick said that to me once.

03:08.510 --> 03:09.109
No,

03:10.021 --> 03:10.828
that was me.

03:14.136 --> 03:15.672
Don't you think
that we should be friends?

03:17.660 --> 03:20.099
Okay, well, you.. you're obviously having
some kind of

03:20.542 --> 03:22.156
reaction to your medications.

03:23.511 --> 03:24.292
We're just gonna go.

03:26.297 --> 03:28.329
Ow! Ow!

03:29.058 --> 03:29.943
Ow!

03:38.381 --> 03:40.286
You know, Mitch,

03:41.324 --> 03:43.667
if you ever want to come hang out
in the basement, you know...

03:44.214 --> 03:44.787
really?

03:45.621 --> 03:46.272
Thanks!

03:47.027 --> 03:50.471
I'd smile, but the left side of my face
is kind of paralyzed.

03:52.912 --> 03:53.485
Forman,

03:53.850 --> 03:55.022
why'd you invite him over?

03:56.042 --> 03:57.751
You were almost out of there,
and you turned back around.

03:58.646 --> 04:01.896
Yeah, Forman, there's only two times in life
that you turn back around...

04:02.060 --> 04:04.042
basketball and runway modeling.

04:08.185 --> 04:09.935
No, and square dancing.

04:12.935 --> 04:14.185
It's called a do-si-do.

04:16.392 --> 04:16.685
Look...

04:18.623 --> 04:20.017
Mitch knows I didn't mean it.

04:21.790 --> 04:22.852
Hey, Eric.

04:26.311 --> 04:29.790
I can't believe you got a hold of the Darth Vader
with the green lightsaber.

04:33.623 --> 04:33.977
What?

04:34.498 --> 04:35.648
No, no, it's..

04:41.785 --> 04:42.540
what a geek.

04:52.849 --> 04:53.396
Wow,

04:53.604 --> 04:54.646
I love this place.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.963
It's not just dinner. It's a thrill ride,

04:58.109 --> 05:00.271
'cause there's a small chance you're gettin' knifed.

05:02.718 --> 05:07.979
I don't know, Bob. I've tried to avoid asians with weapons
ever since 7,000 of them tried to kill me.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.119
Well...

05:15.270 --> 05:18.291
it's thanks to the work of brave
men like you that

05:18.525 --> 05:22.041
america's enemies are working
here for minimum wage.

05:27.879 --> 05:30.431
Mom, would you please stop playing with his hair?

05:30.900 --> 05:32.150
You don't know where it's been.

05:34.285 --> 05:38.582
I think a good dinner time policy might be
everybody feeds and grooms themselves.

05:40.067 --> 05:40.718
Oh, oh.

05:41.186 --> 05:43.087
And speaking of grooming,
Pamela,

05:43.243 --> 05:46.655
I noticed that your skirt was torn
all the way up to your thigh.

05:47.879 --> 05:52.332
No, I actually bought it this way.
See, most skirts are only slit up to the knee,

05:52.667 --> 05:54.783
but I think people want to see more than that.

05:55.792 --> 05:56.508
Hear, hear.

05:59.861 --> 06:01.439
Here... comes the waiter.

06:05.606 --> 06:08.861
I'm glad you're all here to help me celebrate
this very special time

06:09.024 --> 06:10.619
with this very special lady.

06:11.335 --> 06:14.851
Oh, Bob, it means a lot to me
that you realize how special I am.

06:16.055 --> 06:16.706
I do.

06:17.260 --> 06:19.115
That's why I want to ask you to move in with me.

06:20.158 --> 06:21.037
- Oh, my god.
- What?

06:22.925 --> 06:25.399
Gosh, Bob, that's really sweet,

06:25.562 --> 06:27.287
and I'd really love to,

06:27.417 --> 06:28.850
but I'm seeing someone else.

06:30.575 --> 06:31.161
Sorry.

06:33.244 --> 06:34.839
But you'll still come visit, right?

06:46.141 --> 06:46.987
What are you doing?

06:47.931 --> 06:48.778
I'm not touching you.

06:50.601 --> 06:51.317
Stop it!

06:52.684 --> 06:54.798
But I'm not touching you.

06:55.842 --> 06:57.438
Well, stop not touching me.

06:58.577 --> 06:59.066
Okay.

07:01.605 --> 07:03.395
Was it better when I wasn't touching you?

07:03.493 --> 07:04.307
Yeah.

07:07.399 --> 07:09.189
They look happy. Why don't we have a game?

07:13.519 --> 07:15.440
Would you stop asking me
"why don't we have stuff" ?

07:17.100 --> 07:19.086
"why don't we have a song?"
"Why don't we have a movie?"

07:20.811 --> 07:21.430
We're men.

07:22.732 --> 07:24.392
I thought we were sensitive men.

07:25.890 --> 07:26.801
We're not.

07:27.908 --> 07:28.917
One of us is.

07:30.643 --> 07:31.392
Shut up!

07:33.052 --> 07:34.322
And it's not you.

07:36.503 --> 07:38.684
Well, Mitch, I'll tell you what.

07:38.977 --> 07:42.330
It's been really fun having you over,
but it's almost sundown and, uh,

07:43.632 --> 07:45.552
we celebrate the sabbath, so...

07:46.529 --> 07:48.405
unless you have your.. your, uh...

07:49.427 --> 07:50.338
your little beanie,

07:51.235 --> 07:54.049
then I guess we're gonna have
to say adios or shalom,

07:54.147 --> 07:55.189
as we say.

07:55.938 --> 07:57.761
You guys are jewish?!

07:58.151 --> 07:59.388
I'm jewish!

08:03.848 --> 08:06.159
Oh, wow, you are gorgeous.

08:06.518 --> 08:07.495
Are you kidding me?

08:07.950 --> 08:10.229
No, no, no, no, I'm the pretty one. Me.

08:12.736 --> 08:14.852
You're the hottest redhead since batgirl.

08:15.665 --> 08:19.051
And you're not just gorgeous.
I mean, you radiate intelligence

08:19.246 --> 08:20.452
deep thought, a real

08:20.777 --> 08:21.754
sense of self.

08:22.861 --> 08:23.674
Eric,

08:24.325 --> 08:25.530
I like your new friend.

08:27.190 --> 08:28.264
She's gotta be with you, huh?

08:28.720 --> 08:31.324
Oh, I can't say I haven't tried, my little friend,

08:33.342 --> 08:34.580
but she's with Eric...

08:35.589 --> 08:36.240
for now.

08:38.813 --> 08:39.464
Really?

08:40.798 --> 08:44.236
Well, what's wrong with her?
Is she, like, an alcoholic or a drug addict?

08:46.528 --> 08:47.081
Yeah.

08:47.765 --> 08:48.936
Yeah, she's addicted.

08:50.857 --> 08:52.224
She needs a daily dose of this guy.

08:57.954 --> 09:01.014
I just think it's pretty suspicious

09:01.210 --> 09:03.228
that after we left the japanese restaurant

09:03.521 --> 09:06.092
our japanese car broke down.

09:08.599 --> 09:09.413
Hey, buddy.

09:10.857 --> 09:13.885
Whoa, Eric, you didn't tell me
you had an older sister.

09:14.080 --> 09:14.666
Oh,

09:16.717 --> 09:20.232
please, if you're gonna go with fake charm,
let's keep it in the realm of reality, okay?

09:21.014 --> 09:22.902
Oh, you shut your porky mouth.

09:23.976 --> 09:25.897
I have the skin of a 25-year-old...

09:26.743 --> 09:27.557
who smokes.

09:30.714 --> 09:31.610
You know, mr. Forman,

09:31.667 --> 09:35.503
I learned a little about cars from
my uncle who used to fix tanks in Vietnam.

09:35.796 --> 09:36.870
Now that's hero's work...

09:37.358 --> 09:39.377
fixing machines
that kill people you don't agree with.

09:41.590 --> 09:44.162
My only regret is that I haven't had
a chance to fight for my country.

09:44.455 --> 09:45.073
Really?

09:45.985 --> 09:48.329
Eric's only regret is that he doesn't live in space.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.127
That's not my only regret.

09:53.722 --> 09:54.568
It's just one of them.

10:00.004 --> 10:01.176
Excellent fruity bebbles.

10:01.766 --> 10:03.237
You know, at the police academy

10:03.414 --> 10:07.161
they'll only give me corn flakes, 'cause they say
the sugar gets me too hopped upto carry a weapon.

10:10.106 --> 10:13.142
I guess what they weren't counting on
was me taking my weapon home for the weekend.

10:15.369 --> 10:16.251
Poor dad.

10:16.547 --> 10:17.563
He's so upset.

10:18.105 --> 10:21.611
This morning during "the price is right"
he didn't even yodel along during "Cliff Hanger".

10:22.787 --> 10:23.309
Donna,

10:23.545 --> 10:25.427
we wanted them apart and now they are.

10:25.686 --> 10:27.639
Look, some things just don't
belong together, like

10:28.133 --> 10:29.644
my mom and your dad or

10:29.926 --> 10:30.844
michael and a gun.

10:32.773 --> 10:33.997
No, seriously,

10:34.166 --> 10:35.573
how could they give me a gun?

10:39.719 --> 10:41.460
You don't even sound like you feel bad.

10:41.559 --> 10:43.512
Donna, this whole thing is your dad's fault.

10:44.335 --> 10:48.077
Oh, come on, Donna. Who asked the woman to move in with him
after knowing her for such a short time?

10:48.551 --> 10:49.516
I'll tell you who.

10:50.104 --> 10:54.006
The same guy who let you move in here after your parents
took off and you had no place else to go...

10:54.815 --> 10:55.615
my dad.

10:56.302 --> 10:57.596
I mean, you know your mom is wrong

10:58.019 --> 10:58.988
and that she hurt my dad

10:59.530 --> 11:01.365
who's never been anything but nice to you.

11:02.283 --> 11:03.365
How can you defend her?

11:03.770 --> 11:05.041
I picked the pretty one.

11:07.252 --> 11:08.358
Hey, dad.

11:08.804 --> 11:09.980
How you doin'?

11:10.527 --> 11:11.541
How do you think I'm doing?

11:12.085 --> 11:13.983
Pam ripped out my heart and stomped on it

11:14.197 --> 11:15.650
in shoes I paid for.

11:17.437 --> 11:19.477
Well, do you want to go down
to the pet store and look at puppies?

11:20.183 --> 11:22.170
You could sing
"how much is that doggie in the window?"

11:22.303 --> 11:23.823
And I'll do the "arf! Arf!" Part.

11:25.490 --> 11:25.796
Nah,

11:26.050 --> 11:27.167
I'm gonna watch "love boat."

11:27.634 --> 11:30.550
I think the big guy in the shorts
is finally gonna nail the girl with the clipboard.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.651
Ha ha ha ha! Yeah!

11:38.168 --> 11:39.772
I'm sorry. That's the sugar.

11:46.064 --> 11:46.898
Okay, Kelso,

11:47.481 --> 11:48.648
truth or dare?

11:50.899 --> 11:52.540
Uh... truth.

11:53.311 --> 11:55.603
Have you ever snuck into my bathroom
while I was showering?

11:57.978 --> 11:58.540
I mean, dare.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.275
You have snuck in there.

12:01.422 --> 12:03.305
I was there, and I saw you.

12:05.666 --> 12:06.465
I mean, dare.

12:08.465 --> 12:08.882
Okay,

12:09.278 --> 12:10.611
Steven, truth or dare?

12:10.903 --> 12:13.382
The truth will be whether or not you love me,

12:13.632 --> 12:14.757
and the dare will be

12:15.153 --> 12:16.194
telling me that you love me.

12:17.316 --> 12:17.712
Okay.

12:20.650 --> 12:21.337
pass.

12:22.817 --> 12:24.525
Okay, Mitch, truth or dare?

12:24.588 --> 12:26.254
Um, I pick dare, Mitch.

12:26.629 --> 12:27.525
Okay, Mitch,

12:28.108 --> 12:30.233
I dare you to kiss Donna.

12:30.338 --> 12:31.983
Mitch.

12:33.228 --> 12:34.583
Naughty Mitch.

12:35.937 --> 12:38.617
Mitch, you goofball, that's not how it works.
You have to be like,

12:38.749 --> 12:40.353
"I dare you to kiss me."

12:41.387 --> 12:42.096
Okay.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.241
What the hell?!

12:45.283 --> 12:46.262
He did it!

12:47.075 --> 12:49.263
Look at him go. He's like a hummingbird.

12:57.063 --> 12:58.646
I can't believe Mitch would do that.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.541
He just flew at you like one of

13:00.791 --> 13:02.791
the little monkeys from "The Wizard of Oz."

13:05.916 --> 13:06.770
I was scared.

13:07.729 --> 13:10.250
Much like you are when you watch "The Wizard of Oz".

13:11.572 --> 13:12.555
Okay, look,

13:12.622 --> 13:14.072
I don't want Mitch hanging out here anymore.

13:14.589 --> 13:16.889
He was just fooling around.
He didn't mean anything by it.

13:17.572 --> 13:20.922
It's like Fez. He's all over me all the time,
but it doesn't mean he's after me.

13:21.289 --> 13:22.522
Oh. Yes, it does.

13:24.689 --> 13:26.739
From now on, I'll try to be clearer.

13:32.472 --> 13:33.622
Oh, mom, there you are.

13:35.401 --> 13:36.818
How could you do that to Bob?

13:37.201 --> 13:39.335
Now, honey, Bob'll be fine.

13:39.451 --> 13:40.435
No, he won't.

13:41.451 --> 13:45.835
Mom, Bob is a wonderful guy with a huge heart
who only worries about what he could do for other people.

13:46.518 --> 13:47.401
And, yeah, okay,

13:47.734 --> 13:48.868
maybe he has an afro.

13:50.918 --> 13:52.148
But sometimes

13:52.268 --> 13:53.501
goodness and afros

13:53.751 --> 13:54.451
go together.

13:56.151 --> 13:56.618
But, jackie,

13:57.168 --> 13:58.468
the other guy that I'm seeing

13:58.568 --> 14:00.385
is a Lincoln dealer.

14:00.989 --> 14:02.858
Oh, my god, mom, really?!

14:04.022 --> 14:06.355
Wow, we could be driving matching pink..
no, no. Mom, no.

14:06.855 --> 14:07.605
No.

14:08.089 --> 14:09.222
Okay, look, I know..

14:09.772 --> 14:11.189
I know that Bob might not be the

14:11.272 --> 14:13.805
the smoothest or the classiest
guy you've ever dated, but

14:14.155 --> 14:16.272
I've learned that doesn't mean he's a bad person.

14:16.872 --> 14:19.389
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have sent you to public school.

14:21.998 --> 14:27.765
Mom, if you keep thinking this way, you'll always be running 
from one place to another looking for something 
better instead of just being happy with what you have.

14:29.565 --> 14:31.955
You know what? I guess you have
a lot of thinking to do.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.032
You're right.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.448
More tequila, Hirohito.

14:39.632 --> 14:40.598
I said

14:41.248 --> 14:41.932
thinking.

14:48.387 --> 14:48.854
Hello?

14:50.154 --> 14:50.987
Is anyone here?

14:52.687 --> 14:53.254
Hyde?

15:02.476 --> 15:04.526
Well, I guess it's time for me and

15:05.509 --> 15:08.343
24 of my collectible action figure friends

15:11.143 --> 15:13.488
It was a dark time for the force.

15:15.655 --> 15:16.721
After the...

15:17.771 --> 15:19.405
Formanian wars,

15:20.840 --> 15:24.140
young Luke Skywalker had to face
his most formidable enemy yet..

15:24.990 --> 15:25.773
Darth Vader

15:26.657 --> 15:30.007
with a rare and deadlier green lightsaber.

15:33.323 --> 15:33.823
What?

15:34.740 --> 15:35.256
No.

15:36.473 --> 15:38.423
Mitch!

15:42.415 --> 15:44.750
Mitch, these omelets are amazing.

15:45.604 --> 15:48.646
Well, you know, an omelet's only as beautiful
as the person who eats it. So,

15:49.542 --> 15:52.875
I'd have to say that this omelet
has the prettiest red hair I've ever seen.

15:55.267 --> 15:55.663
Thief!

15:56.246 --> 15:57.100
He's a thief!

15:58.184 --> 15:59.705
You stole my Vader action figure.

16:00.559 --> 16:01.830
Oh, you too ?

16:02.267 --> 16:05.142
I thought Eric was the only one weird enough
to play with a doll.

16:06.642 --> 16:08.142
Action figure.

16:08.849 --> 16:11.163
You know, it's bad enough you stole
a kiss from my girlfriend, but this..

16:11.496 --> 16:12.725
this has gone too far.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.976
Oh, so my honor is less important than a doll?

16:16.034 --> 16:17.291
Action figure!

16:19.291 --> 16:20.255
Now give it back!

16:20.411 --> 16:21.557
Hold on just a second.

16:22.026 --> 16:22.755
Now, Mitch,

16:23.432 --> 16:24.864
did you or did you not

16:25.151 --> 16:26.296
put onions in my omelet?

16:28.328 --> 16:29.395
'Cause I asked for 'em,

16:29.604 --> 16:30.672
but I didn't see you put 'em in there.

16:32.417 --> 16:32.911
Eric,

16:33.406 --> 16:34.856
I didn't take your action figure.

16:34.904 --> 16:36.521
- Dolls !
- Action Figure !

16:38.598 --> 16:39.590
I wouldn't do that,

16:39.633 --> 16:40.838
especially not to a friend.

16:41.222 --> 16:41.745
What?

16:42.300 --> 16:43.558
We're not friends, man.

16:43.857 --> 16:44.647
We never were.

16:44.668 --> 16:46.716
I only invited you over here
'cause I felt bad for you,

16:47.047 --> 16:48.668
but I don't like you.
And guess what.

16:49.031 --> 16:50.226
Neither does anyone else.

16:52.860 --> 16:53.308
Fine.

16:56.999 --> 16:58.364
I won't bother you guys anymore.

17:05.663 --> 17:08.363
Somebody needs to flip that in about three minutes!

17:13.880 --> 17:15.063
Well, that was brutal.

17:15.766 --> 17:17.348
I feel bad for the little guy.

17:17.983 --> 17:20.516
I just wanna put him up on my shoulders
and buy him a balloon.

17:23.311 --> 17:23.963
Eric,

17:25.031 --> 17:26.515
how could you?

17:27.016 --> 17:28.910
Mitch had a lot of good qualities,

17:29.183 --> 17:31.183
like, for example, he worshiped me.

17:32.912 --> 17:36.099
I mean, at one point, I thought he was gonna
light a fire and dance around me.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.370
Yeah, well, you know what?
I was right, okay?

17:40.495 --> 17:41.287
He's a thief.

17:41.870 --> 17:45.141
Eric, were you playing in the bathtub
with your little doll?

17:45.308 --> 17:47.412
Action figure!

17:50.162 --> 17:50.870
Oh, no.

17:52.276 --> 17:53.797
In the tub, Forman?

17:57.318 --> 17:59.443
It is getting really hard to be your friend.

18:05.052 --> 18:05.538
Okay,

18:05.809 --> 18:08.684
I'd like to thank everyone
for coming back here with me.

18:09.246 --> 18:10.767
True, it is the place of my

18:10.872 --> 18:12.101
greatest humiliation.

18:13.851 --> 18:16.232
But the fish is good, the sake's strong, and

18:16.523 --> 18:18.732
these japanese people are funny to watch.

18:21.961 --> 18:23.294
That's the spirit, dad..

18:23.815 --> 18:25.544
the slightly offensive spirit.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.836
Well, you know, I think you're lucky
to be rid of Pam with

18:29.981 --> 18:32.377
her halter tops
and her tight skirts.

18:32.419 --> 18:34.752
You know, I've never even seen a panty line on her.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.502
You know what that means.

18:38.336 --> 18:40.370
Plus, you're too nice for my mom anyway.

18:40.940 --> 18:41.378
You know,

18:41.878 --> 18:44.961
someday you're gonna make
a slightly less attractive woman very happy.

18:47.919 --> 18:48.919
Hello, Bob.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.044
No, it's not a beautiful dream,

18:51.107 --> 18:52.065
it's really me.

18:54.107 --> 18:57.169
I've been doing some thinking, Bob, and I

18:57.232 --> 18:59.565
realized that my priorities
are a little mixed up.

19:00.047 --> 19:01.047
I told her that!

19:01.214 --> 19:03.297
That was me!
I saved the day!

19:05.109 --> 19:09.214
It doesn't matter how it happened.
The important thing is she's back in our lives.

19:12.552 --> 19:16.260
Anyway, Bob, I realize that you're the man for me.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.552
I'm sorry, Pam.

19:18.891 --> 19:19.691
It's too late.

19:20.491 --> 19:21.841
I'm completely over you..

19:22.241 --> 19:24.875
o-v-e-r, over.

19:26.091 --> 19:27.325
And I want to move in with you.

19:27.808 --> 19:28.658
Here's your key.

19:31.496 --> 19:32.043
Dad?

19:33.416 --> 19:35.016
Are you sure this is a good idea?

19:35.550 --> 19:37.043
She makes me happy, kitten.

19:39.507 --> 19:40.587
Ugh, fine.

19:41.333 --> 19:44.027
But I don't want to see, like, any of
her pantie slaying around the house.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.850
Oh, don't worry. You won't.

19:55.770 --> 19:56.636
Hey, Mitch.

19:58.836 --> 20:00.986
Look, I wanted to apologize.

20:01.370 --> 20:04.186
I thought you stole my Vader,
but it turns out I left it in the b..

20:09.605 --> 20:10.418
Hyde stole it.

20:12.568 --> 20:14.977
Yeah, I guess I was out of line, too.
I shouldn't have

20:15.400 --> 20:16.898
jumped on your girlfriend...

20:18.135 --> 20:19.632
in front of you.

20:21.585 --> 20:22.432
It's just, you have

20:22.855 --> 20:24.092
such a great life.

20:25.101 --> 20:30.180
And if I never see you or your friends ever again,
I'm always gonna treasure that time that I spent with Donna.

20:33.468 --> 20:34.607
Okay, well...

20:36.560 --> 20:37.895
then I'll just say good-bye.

20:44.921 --> 20:46.158
so lonely.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.952
Hey, Mitch, uh...

20:53.645 --> 20:55.370
you know, if you ever want to hang out,

20:55.761 --> 20:57.258
you know, you're always...

21:00.123 --> 21:00.579
you know.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.271
Great. Thanks.

21:03.215 --> 21:04.160
Oh, are we gonna do this now?

21:04.257 --> 21:06.276
Yeah, buddy, let's do it!

21:08.522 --> 21:09.336
Okay.

21:09.466 --> 21:10.019
Right.

21:10.377 --> 21:10.735
Hey,

21:11.452 --> 21:13.437
so do you think I might have a shot with Donna?

21:15.586 --> 21:17.051
Mitch, she's my fiancÃ©.

21:17.246 --> 21:18.548
So that's a maybe!

21:27.285 --> 21:29.076
Oh, Pamela, hi.

21:29.336 --> 21:30.606
I just, um,

21:30.866 --> 21:32.624
came here
to get my scarf.

21:32.754 --> 21:35.358
Oh, phew, here it is.

21:35.944 --> 21:37.474
You lost our scarf

21:37.572 --> 21:40.078
I must to make you nervous.
We take a drink ?

21:40.339 --> 21:42.390
Oh, oh, well,
it's a little early, but..

21:42.931 --> 21:44.885
oh, it's probably
5:00 somewhere.

21:45.340 --> 21:47.293
Two saigon slammers,
hold the fruit.

21:47.847 --> 21:49.084
First round's on me.

21:49.344 --> 21:50.093
That's okay.

21:50.353 --> 21:51.363
I have a tab.
