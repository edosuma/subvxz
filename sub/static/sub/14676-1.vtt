Most people think you dance
with your feet. Bollocks.

01:33.245 --> 01:36.872
You dance with your heart.
You dance with <i>el corazón.</i>

01:36.873 --> 01:39.375

a heart like a bison

- Oh, God.

04:22.414 --> 04:25.916
Why do we have to do this
every morning? It's not a bike.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.916
Not now it's not, but I just watched
you transform it on the monitor.

04:29.254 --> 04:32.840
Look, I'll admit, for a while
outside it was a bike,

04:32.841 --> 04:36.302
but now, piff, paff,
poof, look at that.

04:36.303 --> 04:38.471
It's a piece of luggage.

What have you gone for here?
This what you're wearing today?

04:50.609 --> 04:52.318
I cycle in wearing it.

04:52.319 --> 04:54.111
You just looked in your
wardrobe and thought,

04:54.112 --> 04:57.198
"I think I'll just look like a
Maxi Babybel today." Was that it?

04:57.199 --> 04:59.408
- Have you shaved?
- No.

04:59.409 --> 05:01.952
Just lift your...
Some jam on your stubble.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.954
Don't do that in front of everyone.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.165
It's a big day, a big day, man.

05:06.166 --> 05:08.250
Got the new boss
starting this morning.

05:08.251 --> 05:10.377
I hear he's a ball buster.

05:10.378 --> 05:13.627
Well, I hear apparently
he is a she.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.509
You mean like a tranny?

05:17.510 --> 05:19.094
- No.
- No.

05:19.095 --> 05:22.424
- A woman.
- Oh... a woman.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.893
What kind of a woman
wants to run a company

05:25.894 --> 05:28.520
that specialises in heavy
industrial machinery?

05:28.521 --> 05:31.357
I think I know.

05:31.358 --> 05:33.526
Big, hairy.

05:34.152 --> 05:36.237
- Big sort of big lump.
- A beast.

05:38.490 --> 05:39.987
Might be perfect for you.

05:40.617 --> 05:44.245
Hmm. Anyway, listen, this bike's
not going to park itself.

05:44.246 --> 05:46.580
I'll see you up there, OK?
Don't be late.

05:46.581 --> 05:49.661
I don't like my team to be late.
It's unprofessional, isn't it, bum flap?

05:51.670 --> 05:54.248
There they are, Mork and Mindy.

06:08.144 --> 06:11.473
Uh, Helen.

06:15.193 --> 06:17.441
Can you not hear that?

06:18.863 --> 06:20.990
- Hello, Bruce Garrett.
- 'Hello, Bruce.

06:20.991 --> 06:22.992
'Do you like scary films?'

06:22.993 --> 06:24.576
- What?
- 'I'm doing "Scream".

06:24.577 --> 06:26.537
- 'You totally bought it.'
- Oh, hi, Drew.

06:26.538 --> 06:29.582
'They're going to unleash
the beast, Bruce.'

06:32.794 --> 06:38.090
Who wouldn't swap the crystal
blue waters of the Pacific

06:38.091 --> 06:43.013
for the endless silted mud flats
of old Father Thames? Am I right?

06:44.848 --> 06:49.184
Uh, and hopefully I can prove to you
that I'm a better sales manager

06:49.185 --> 06:51.228
than I am a public speaker.

06:52.605 --> 06:54.606
I bet she's got the bag
to go with them shoes.

06:54.607 --> 06:58.402
- Mm?
- Her, United States of Bitch Face.

06:58.403 --> 07:00.946
Little Miss I'm-So-American.

07:02.866 --> 07:06.035
OK, I'm going to stop talking now.
Let's all have a drink.

07:06.036 --> 07:08.489
Hear, hear.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.500
- Oi.
- You were right, you know?

07:13.501 --> 07:15.544
She is a woman.

07:15.545 --> 07:18.498
And what a woman. Wow-wow-wee-wah.

07:19.341 --> 07:23.344
I would make a splash inside that
like a milk truck hitting a wall.

07:23.345 --> 07:26.722
Listen, can we not... Can we not
talk ejaculate at the buffet table?

07:26.723 --> 07:30.973
Look at her, though. Look at
my little dairy queen, uh?

07:32.187 --> 07:34.313
You see? You had
little a look, too.

07:34.314 --> 07:36.982
- Oh, some tzatziki.
- Oh, that's cute.

07:36.983 --> 07:40.069
No, it is. It's adorable, Bruce.
That's all right. You can look.

07:40.070 --> 07:43.030
But don't touch 'cause that would
be embarrassing, wouldn't it?

07:43.031 --> 07:45.366
- Just leave it to the experts.
- Sure.

07:45.367 --> 07:49.119
- The sexperts. I just coined that.
- That's quite good, actually.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.822
- Wasn't it?
- Don't!

07:58.004 --> 07:59.254
Whoa!

07:59.255 --> 08:02.716
Work time is over, motherfuckers.

08:02.717 --> 08:05.302
Ah, I think we know
what that means.

08:05.303 --> 08:08.389
That means, oh, oh,
it's party time.

08:08.390 --> 08:10.057
That's right.

08:10.058 --> 08:12.434
Who wants to come and play
with the dancing bear?

08:12.435 --> 08:15.604
This one... This one loves
a little bear time.

08:15.605 --> 08:17.606
- Oh, God.
- Come on.

08:17.607 --> 08:20.401
- Not me.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

08:20.402 --> 08:22.277
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:22.278 --> 08:25.823
Oh, there it is. You've got a little
bit of rhythm going on there.

08:25.824 --> 08:29.243
That's it, see?
What are you worried about?

08:29.244 --> 08:32.121
- She moves like a gem.
- Oh.

08:32.121 --> 08:33.914
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you like?

08:33.914 --> 08:37.501
And she loves a spin.
That was good, you see?

08:37.501 --> 08:39.669
Oh, what about this one?

08:39.671 --> 08:42.214
Little silent but
deadly in the corner.

08:42.215 --> 08:45.259
- Stop it.
- You going to come dancing with me?

08:45.260 --> 08:48.595
- Just a little something-something.
- Don't.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.049
- What?
- I don't dance.

08:51.850 --> 08:55.224
- Everybody's dancing.
- I don't dance. I don't like it.

08:55.979 --> 08:58.188
All right, make yourself useful.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.391
Oh, Oh.

09:01.443 --> 09:03.485
Come on.

09:03.486 --> 09:06.986
Oh, the line broke,
'cause it was a big fish.

09:07.490 --> 09:10.739
What time is it? It's Cossack time!

09:13.079 --> 09:15.156
Oh, yes.

09:17.459 --> 09:19.286
Hey, Bruce!

09:22.464 --> 09:25.383
Oh, you like it!

09:30.430 --> 09:32.139
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

09:32.140 --> 09:34.516
- Wow, I am so sorry.
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

09:34.517 --> 09:37.060
We've got tangled here.
Let me try and get this... Ow!

09:37.061 --> 09:38.645
- Ow.
- Ow.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.773
Again, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

09:41.774 --> 09:43.984
Where am I? Am I in England?

09:43.985 --> 09:46.563
No, I'm fine.
Just... fine.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.491
Maybe we should get
these untangled.

09:50.492 --> 09:53.320
- Bruce Garrett.
- Bruce Garrett, that's me and...

09:54.496 --> 09:57.664
- Julio Matthews.
- They printed it wrong.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.917
But I like it, so I'm
going to keep it.

09:59.918 --> 10:02.252
Yeah. No, you should.
I think it suits you.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.379
Adds Latin flavour to it.

10:04.380 --> 10:06.708
Oh.

10:07.717 --> 10:11.386
I just want you to know I wasn't
trying to escape your party.

10:11.387 --> 10:16.013
No, me neither. Why would anybody
want to leave that amazing party?

10:16.809 --> 10:18.977
- Uh, shall we...
- Yes.

10:19.729 --> 10:24.107
Well, what a pickle, a 3-D jigsaw.

10:24.108 --> 10:26.902
Thank you. Nice to meet you, Bruce.

10:27.737 --> 10:30.531
Likewise... Julio.

10:32.116 --> 10:33.825
Mm.

10:33.826 --> 10:36.745
Mm. Do you know what I like
best about this place?

10:36.746 --> 10:38.664
Apart from the free glacé cherries?

10:38.665 --> 10:40.874
Apart from the free glacé cherries,

10:40.875 --> 10:42.709
the fact that they
still insist upon

10:42.710 --> 10:44.795
my little sister dressing up
like a Tongan concubine.

10:44.796 --> 10:48.131
Oh, they don't insist and I
prefer Polynesian call girl.

10:48.132 --> 10:49.716
Mm-hm.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.635
So talk me through
head-butting your new boss.

10:51.636 --> 10:54.429
Well, actually, she might
have head-butted me,

10:54.430 --> 10:58.225
but our lanyards tangled.
There was a struggle, you know?

10:58.226 --> 11:00.561
Our heads went forward.
There was a crash, wallop.

11:00.562 --> 11:02.854
Mm, sounds like she made
quite an impression.

11:02.855 --> 11:05.107
- No, no, not this again.
- Oh, come on, Bruce.

11:05.108 --> 11:07.776
You haven't even mentioned a girl
since, what, the early '90s?

11:07.777 --> 11:10.445
Stand down, Samantha, please.
She is not of my world.

11:10.446 --> 11:13.115
Oh and what world is that,
the world of not even trying?

11:13.116 --> 11:16.994
Yeah, indeed, the planet She's
Beautiful, Way Out Of My League,

11:16.995 --> 11:19.121
and also my boss, so
knock it on the head.

11:19.122 --> 11:22.124
Oh, that well-known place. Is that
right next to precious comfort zone?

11:22.125 --> 11:25.002
A place you've never even
stepped out of ever.

11:25.003 --> 11:27.254
All I'm saying is that if
you really like something,

11:27.255 --> 11:31.710
you've got to put yourself out there.
Got to reach out and grab it.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.428
The cherries are not
that delicious.

11:34.429 --> 11:36.269
I'm not talking about
the cherries, Bruce.

11:42.895 --> 11:44.813
I would not like to be those tyres.

11:44.814 --> 11:48.859
- Ouch.
- Ha-ha, yeah, very amusing!

11:48.860 --> 11:52.821
It comes fitted with an 80-mil,
three jaw self-centring chuck.

11:52.822 --> 11:56.151
Tool size, eight mil max. I mean,
you'd never need any more.

11:57.535 --> 12:00.829
- Hey, hello. This is, uh, Ju...
- Oh, sorry, everybody.

12:00.830 --> 12:03.498
Let me introduce you to the
brains of the operation,

12:03.499 --> 12:06.585
our head of department,
Miss Julia Matthews.

12:06.586 --> 12:10.047
Uh... I'm sorry. Keep going.
I was just going to sit in.

12:10.048 --> 12:12.250
It's nice to have you with us.

12:13.051 --> 12:15.260
- Are you done?
- Yeah.

12:15.261 --> 12:17.638
- Any questions?
- What's the capacity?

12:17.639 --> 12:19.431
- Ah, capacity.
- Ah.

12:19.432 --> 12:22.434
- It's 250 mil between the centres.
- You really know your stuff.

12:22.435 --> 12:26.060
Thank you. Thank you.
I... I love lathes.

12:31.986 --> 12:38.158
Oh, while I remember, we can
also provide, um, promo videos.

12:38.159 --> 12:39.826
- Isn't that right, Bruce?
- Mm.

12:39.827 --> 12:43.997
Actually, I think we've got one of
those on this computer right here.

12:43.998 --> 12:46.416
Not on that one.
Let me have a look.

12:46.417 --> 12:50.796
Yeah, I think I saw the one for
the DML vertical lathe on here

12:50.797 --> 12:52.464
- somewhere the other day.
- No.

12:52.465 --> 12:54.800
- Wait, there it is. Hold on.
- Is it?

12:54.801 --> 12:58.011
Yeah, this is a really good example
of the videos we can give you.

12:58.012 --> 13:02.265
'Hello, with a Meehanite frame
annealed for maximum rigidity,

13:02.266 --> 13:06.478
'it offers perfect jib-bed
flushing each and every time.

13:06.479 --> 13:08.855
'The Haas ST30 turning lathe,

13:08.856 --> 13:12.818
'it offers precision grinding
over full vertical stroke.'

13:12.819 --> 13:17.445
This is what I think of when I'm
trying not to ejaculate too quickly.

13:30.712 --> 13:34.166
OK, green fees paid, let's
play the game of golf game.

13:34.590 --> 13:35.924
Please help me.

13:35.925 --> 13:37.801
Are you still banging
on about those balls?

13:37.802 --> 13:39.594
Well, yes, this one's
going to fly further,

13:39.595 --> 13:41.888
but this one's going to give me
more control round the green.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.515
If we've finished with
the high-brow chit-chat,

13:43.516 --> 13:45.308
can we move on please
to the weekly roundup?

13:45.309 --> 13:47.060
- Yes, yes.
- OK, ladies and gentlemen.

13:47.061 --> 13:49.604
Totals for the week,
dates with a lady?

13:49.605 --> 13:51.106
- Nil.
- Nil.

13:51.107 --> 13:53.525
- Mobile numbers acquired?
- Nil.

13:53.526 --> 13:55.986
I got a number. It was a zero.

13:55.987 --> 13:58.238
Ah, erotic encounters?

13:58.239 --> 13:59.823
Nilly vanilly.

13:59.824 --> 14:03.535
Now, listen to this.
Last Sunday at Tom's christening,

14:03.536 --> 14:06.288
I grazed past horny
Aunty Jean's side boob?

14:06.289 --> 14:07.957
- Does it count?
- Adjudicator?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.876
- It's a nil.
- I thought I'd throw it in.

14:10.877 --> 14:13.503
Finally, have you had any contact
with a member of the opposite sex

14:13.504 --> 14:15.088
where money did not exchange hands

14:15.089 --> 14:16.923
and she looked at you for
more than eight seconds

14:16.924 --> 14:20.051
and she was not your mum
or an arresting officer?

14:20.052 --> 14:21.970
Nil.

14:22.847 --> 14:25.140
Bruce?

14:25.141 --> 14:27.184
Mm? Well, no, obvs...

14:27.185 --> 14:29.683
Here endeth the weekly roundup.

14:31.898 --> 14:33.899
Hurry up, Mickey!

14:39.864 --> 14:43.068
Ah, thank you... very much.

14:44.035 --> 14:45.577
- Oh.
- What is it?

14:45.578 --> 14:47.913
- Shit. Nothing. Please don't look.
- What's wrong?

14:47.914 --> 14:49.581
What are you doing? What is it?

14:49.582 --> 14:52.125
- Please don't look.
- Who is it, hm?

14:52.126 --> 14:55.045
It's just someone from work.
It's a girl I work with.

14:55.046 --> 14:57.923
- Oh, my God, she's nice.
- Don't look. Stop it.

14:57.924 --> 15:00.425
- Hey, turn around, will you?
- Oh, I would...

15:00.426 --> 15:03.470
- If I was physically able...
- You're not dis...

15:03.471 --> 15:05.719
You're not disabled,
Gary. You're married.

15:07.225 --> 15:09.723
Go on, then. Have a go.

15:10.478 --> 15:13.230
Did you see her? She's beautiful.
She's like a ten. I'm a two.

15:13.231 --> 15:17.317
That's an eight-point swing, like a
butterfly going out with a parsnip.

15:17.318 --> 15:19.361
- What?
- Yeah. Well, you know...

15:19.362 --> 15:22.697
All right, I'm not saying
it's going to be easy.

15:22.698 --> 15:25.450
You'll have to work at it.
It's like that, um,

15:25.451 --> 15:27.410
that machine you're on about
for British Aerospace.

15:27.411 --> 15:29.913
- The PL5 cylindrical grinder.
- Thank you.

15:29.914 --> 15:32.958
She's the cylinder. Click-click.

15:32.959 --> 15:35.752
You're the grinder, mm?

15:35.753 --> 15:39.798
Just grind her down, uh, uh, uh.

15:39.799 --> 15:43.802
- You grind her down.
- I don't like the two-finger bit.

15:43.803 --> 15:46.677
Make her notice you, Bruce.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.687
- Think I should say hello?
- Oh, don't... no.

15:53.688 --> 15:56.107
Go up there and say
something like...

15:57.650 --> 15:59.651
"Hi."

15:59.652 --> 16:01.820
Oh.

16:03.614 --> 16:07.993
Woo-hoo. Good luck, mate.

16:07.994 --> 16:09.911
- Bruce.
- Yes?

16:09.912 --> 16:11.872
Grind it.

16:11.873 --> 16:14.667
Don't do that. Don't be daft.

16:47.783 --> 16:49.735
'Salsa.'

16:50.536 --> 16:52.495
Why did it have to be salsa?

16:52.496 --> 16:56.666
'Eat them. Eat them pig boy.
Eat your sequins.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.336
'Eat them. Eat them!

16:59.337 --> 17:02.211
'Who do you think you are?
Barry Manilow?

17:04.300 --> 17:06.673
'Eat them...'

17:14.977 --> 17:16.895
Hey, Rick, have you seen my sister?

17:16.896 --> 17:20.022
- She's over there.
- Sam, Sam. Sam, sorry.

17:20.023 --> 17:22.271
- Give us a second.
- I need you.

17:26.196 --> 17:28.239
She is of my world.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.367
- Who is?
- Julia, my boss.

17:30.368 --> 17:32.911
You stepped out of
your comfort zone.

17:32.912 --> 17:36.957
I was at the pub. She came in.
I followed her.

17:36.958 --> 17:39.626
And she was salsa dancing.

17:39.627 --> 17:41.711
- Are you shitting me?
- Oh, my God.

17:41.712 --> 17:44.130
She was doing the
sweetest little basic

17:44.131 --> 17:47.217
and I just wanted to rush in
and gather her into my arms

17:47.218 --> 17:50.470
and... and... just dance, you know?

17:50.471 --> 17:54.766
I haven't... I have not
felt like that since...

17:54.767 --> 17:57.519
- Sequin-gate.
- Since Sequin-gate.

17:57.520 --> 18:02.065
You know that box has been
closed a long, long time.

18:02.066 --> 18:05.110
I know. It happened and it was bad.

18:05.111 --> 18:08.029
What did you say? Bad?

18:08.030 --> 18:12.325
Sam... they ripped all the
sequins off of my shirt

18:12.326 --> 18:15.495
and they stuffed them
in my mouth, yeah?

18:15.496 --> 18:18.999
And then they made me eat them.
The big boys made me gobble them, yeah?

18:19.000 --> 18:22.085
Just gobbling, gobbling sequins.

18:22.086 --> 18:24.963
- Gobbling the big BMX boy.
- Know the story, Bruce.

18:24.964 --> 18:27.841
- Gobbling.
- Enough's enough. Now, listen.

18:27.842 --> 18:30.552
Maybe this is your chance
to rewrite history.

18:30.553 --> 18:32.096
Let it go.

18:35.141 --> 18:37.142
What are you thinking about?

18:37.143 --> 18:39.971
These are fucking hot
in large quantities.

18:40.688 --> 18:42.765
Thank you.

18:45.109 --> 18:47.360
Fucking hell, what is...
What is that?

18:47.361 --> 18:51.031
- Vodka.
- Why would you give me neat vodka?

18:54.035 --> 18:56.411
Now, listen, maybe
this is your way in.

18:56.412 --> 18:59.164
You know how all girls
love a man who can dance.

18:59.165 --> 19:01.333
You could dance.

19:01.792 --> 19:06.122
If you really like this girl,
salsa your way in.

19:08.424 --> 19:11.844
- I had fire in my heels, didn't I?
- Oh, feet of flames.

19:13.679 --> 19:16.803
- Could I get it back again, though?
- Easily.

19:18.059 --> 19:20.102
How easily?

19:21.562 --> 19:23.685
See how I do this shot...

19:25.107 --> 19:27.192
- That easily.
- That was easy.

19:27.193 --> 19:29.277
- Mm.
- Can I have one?

19:29.278 --> 19:31.526
- One?
- Mm-hm.

19:33.616 --> 19:35.575
Salsa.

19:35.576 --> 19:37.198
Mm.

19:38.496 --> 19:40.664
Cheers.

19:49.924 --> 19:51.376
Ah.

19:58.224 --> 20:00.391
Salsa.

20:00.392 --> 20:02.594
Salsa.

20:06.482 --> 20:08.525
And the winner is...

20:09.235 --> 20:11.437
Bruce Garrett.

20:24.208 --> 20:26.417
There's Ron.

20:26.418 --> 20:28.086
"Be my Valentine."

20:28.087 --> 20:31.416
Mm, big old ginger Glen and Ted.

20:35.636 --> 20:39.386
Mirrors, I need me some mirrors.

20:45.688 --> 20:47.188
Ooh.

20:47.189 --> 20:48.982
Heavy.

20:48.983 --> 20:50.730
Oh.

21:03.414 --> 21:04.956
Whoa.

21:10.421 --> 21:12.839
Ooh!

21:12.840 --> 21:15.008
Ah.

21:18.179 --> 21:20.381
Uh...

22:09.230 --> 22:10.852
Mm.

23:06.203 --> 23:09.497
Can I have a Diet Coke and a
packet of Scampi Fries, please?

23:09.498 --> 23:12.417
Well, you could if
I wasn't closing.

23:13.210 --> 23:15.208
All right, Ron?

23:19.341 --> 23:21.509
Garrett.

23:21.510 --> 23:24.262
Well, what the hell happened to you?
You look like shit.

23:24.263 --> 23:25.930
Charming. Thanks very much.

23:25.931 --> 23:29.392
You got a customer complaints
department here at, er, El Corazón?

23:29.393 --> 23:31.595
Oh, hang on, I'll
get a form for you.

23:34.231 --> 23:36.399
There it is.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.860
How did you find me?

23:38.861 --> 23:40.445
Internet.

23:40.446 --> 23:42.523
- Fucking internet.
- Internet.

23:43.324 --> 23:47.279
Oh, yeah, how have you been?
Have you been all right? You good?

23:48.537 --> 23:51.286
It looks nice in here.

23:51.749 --> 23:54.702
OK, I think that is us
all caught up, then.

23:56.253 --> 24:01.549
- What do you want from me, Garrett?
- Nothing. Just passing.

24:01.550 --> 24:03.923
Wondered if you were
still teaching.

24:05.346 --> 24:11.476
Oh, right, OK, just 'cause
I'm looking for a lesson.

24:11.477 --> 24:13.353
- Are you taking the piss?
- No.

24:13.354 --> 24:17.231
No, I'm not. I just want a
lesson, blow away the cobwebs.

24:17.232 --> 24:20.068
- What do you reckon?
- I reckon salsa's for pussies.

24:20.069 --> 24:21.986
- Isn't that what you said?
- Did I?

24:21.987 --> 24:23.738
Oh, yeah, you did.

24:23.739 --> 24:28.493
I don't really remember that,
'cause I was just a kid.

24:28.494 --> 24:31.788
- And what are you now?
- I'm a man.

24:31.789 --> 24:33.790
Oh, you think so, do you?

24:33.791 --> 24:38.121
Pretty certain.
Hot in here, isn't it?

24:39.713 --> 24:43.341
We'll see. Tomorrow
night, 7:00 pm sharp.

24:43.342 --> 24:46.344
Five quid on the door and I want
to see you in 1% inch heels.

24:46.345 --> 24:49.424
Brilliant. Great, all right.
Thank you, Ron.

24:50.349 --> 24:53.098
- Mr Parfitt.
- Thank you, Mr Parfitt.

24:53.394 --> 24:54.977
Hey, where are we on
the Scampi Fries?

24:54.978 --> 24:57.101
- Piss off.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

25:03.362 --> 25:05.446
Come here, my babies.

25:05.447 --> 25:08.116
Come to Daddy.

25:08.117 --> 25:10.411
Oh, there you are.

25:26.718 --> 25:28.886
- Thank you.
- One, thank you.

25:42.693 --> 25:47.273
Rubber sole. Old school.

25:48.323 --> 25:51.033
A shit load of kudos
to you, my friend.

25:51.034 --> 25:54.363
Personally, as a person,
I love the suede sole.

25:54.997 --> 25:58.332
I'm a suede head. People, they say,
"No, you have to be rubber sole."

25:58.333 --> 26:01.669
I'm like, "No, I love the suede.
I love the suede. I love the suede."

26:01.670 --> 26:05.423
Don't you love the suede?
I tell you what. Take a look at this.

26:05.424 --> 26:07.550
If you see here, if you
see where my sole is...

26:07.551 --> 26:09.844
Come on, gather around. Come on.

26:09.845 --> 26:12.263
I see what kind of a
sole you are, asshole.

26:12.264 --> 26:14.640
- Hey, don't...
- How are you today, guys?

26:14.641 --> 26:17.185
Spread out a little bit.
Make sure you can see me.

26:17.186 --> 26:19.145
Everybody OK, yeah?

26:19.146 --> 26:21.147
Oh, we've got a new
student with us tonight.

26:21.148 --> 26:23.100
Welcome to El Corazón.
What's your name?

26:23.901 --> 26:27.612
It's fine. Don't worry about names.
I'm just passing through so...

26:27.613 --> 26:29.489
- Sure, no problem.
- Thank you.

26:29.490 --> 26:31.532
Let's pick up where we
left off yesterday, OK?

26:31.533 --> 26:33.034
Basic step, everyone. Ready?

26:33.035 --> 26:36.496
And one, two, three,
five, six, seven and...

26:36.497 --> 26:38.748
- Sorry
- Yes?

26:38.749 --> 26:40.833
I think I'm in the wrong class.

26:40.834 --> 26:43.085
- Right.
- Where's Mr Parfitt?

26:43.086 --> 26:46.005
- He's in his office, OK?
- OK.

26:46.006 --> 26:48.257
All right, let's carry on.
Ready and...

26:48.258 --> 26:51.719
What's he, um... Sorry.
What's he doing in there?

26:51.720 --> 26:54.472
- I don't know.
- Fine, all right.

26:54.473 --> 26:56.057
- I'm sorry. Crack on.
- That's all right.

26:56.058 --> 26:57.642
- We will, thank you.
- Do your basics.

26:57.643 --> 26:59.685
Thank you very much. Here we go.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.854
Ready and one, two, three.

27:04.525 --> 27:06.477
Hello?

27:10.364 --> 27:14.325
- Hey. Are you not teaching me?
- I said I ran a class.

27:14.326 --> 27:17.912
- Didn't say I taught one.
- Ron, please.

27:17.913 --> 27:21.788
It's baby stuff out there.
Just one quick freshener.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.712
Oh, I see.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.214
OK.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.470
I think we've done...
One private lesson.

27:34.596 --> 27:38.426
How much do you want?
40 for an hour?

27:38.725 --> 27:40.434
Oh, that's what you think.

27:40.435 --> 27:41.852
You think I sit back here

27:41.853 --> 27:43.938
waiting for someone to come
in and open their wallet?

27:43.939 --> 27:45.937
Yeah, what are you waiting for?

27:49.861 --> 27:51.938
Alicia.

27:53.574 --> 27:57.660
- Hello.
- This is Bruce Garrett.

27:57.661 --> 27:59.579
- Take him out for a quick spin.
- No.

27:59.580 --> 28:00.830
Road test him.

28:00.831 --> 28:02.957
Alicia teaches our advanced class,

28:02.958 --> 28:06.794
2007 world champion,
dances cabaret style.

28:06.795 --> 28:08.588
Oh, yes, yes.

28:08.589 --> 28:11.759
You do know cabaret style, yeah?

28:12.175 --> 28:16.721
Sorry, do I... You ask
if I know cabaret style?

28:28.275 --> 28:30.276
Do you want to get warm?

28:30.277 --> 28:32.862
You should, although you
look quite warm as it is.

28:39.244 --> 28:41.446
I hear about you.

28:43.206 --> 28:46.792
- Ah.
- The boy with fire in his heels.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.836
Well, that's a long time ago.

28:49.254 --> 28:50.630
Aw.

28:50.631 --> 28:52.879
- You're in my yard now.
- Mm?

28:55.135 --> 28:57.011
Oh, crikey.

28:57.012 --> 28:58.509
Shh-ah.

29:00.515 --> 29:02.717
Ah, cha.

29:03.810 --> 29:06.729
- Ya.
- Rumba!

29:22.621 --> 29:23.954
Ow!

29:23.955 --> 29:25.828
Ow!

29:28.919 --> 29:31.292
Ow!

29:45.686 --> 29:47.729
Please.

29:57.364 --> 29:59.111
Stop it.

30:00.075 --> 30:01.575
Ooh.

30:01.576 --> 30:03.703
Welcome back.

30:09.376 --> 30:11.328
That's lesson one, son.

30:21.012 --> 30:22.885
Thank you.

30:33.734 --> 30:35.776
All right, dump truck.

30:35.777 --> 30:37.486
Have you seen what
she's wearing today?

30:37.487 --> 30:40.573
- Who?
- The big boss, yeah.

30:40.574 --> 30:43.159
She's got her green number on.
Isn't that nice?

30:43.160 --> 30:45.494
She's trying to tell me something,
you know what I mean?

30:45.495 --> 30:48.706
She's trying to tell me something.

30:48.707 --> 30:51.584
I'm going to leave a stink on her
that she will never get off.

30:51.585 --> 30:54.670
I'm going to be on her like
bonfire smell, you know I mean?

30:54.671 --> 30:58.048
She's going to be in the
shower changing her clothes.

30:58.049 --> 31:02.762
She's going to be like,
"OMG, I can still smell him."

31:02.763 --> 31:06.012
That's right, Julia. Get used to it.
I'm in your pores.

31:06.933 --> 31:09.852
You're disgusting.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.191
I think it's so cute when
you've got a little crush.

31:15.192 --> 31:18.736
You get a little crush and you
get so disgusted. Listen.

31:18.737 --> 31:23.818
Women like that use guys like you
to get advice about men like me.

31:26.119 --> 31:28.242
It's empty.

31:52.813 --> 31:55.105
Are you kidding me?

31:55.106 --> 31:56.816
Argh!

31:56.817 --> 31:58.901
Ah! Oh...

31:58.902 --> 32:00.528
Oh, God.

32:00.529 --> 32:03.239
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.616
- Oh, my God, are you OK?
- Yeah.

32:05.617 --> 32:09.078
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- Really, no, I'm fine.

32:09.079 --> 32:12.078
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

32:14.793 --> 32:17.711
In for two, out for two. Slow down.

32:17.712 --> 32:21.086
- Was there a pastry in this bag?
- Yeah, I had an iced bun.

32:22.634 --> 32:24.009
I was driving...

32:24.010 --> 32:26.929
and then, all of a sudden, my tape
deck wasn't working and then bang!

32:26.930 --> 32:29.265
All of a sudden you were on the hood
of my car. I thought I'd killed you.

32:29.266 --> 32:31.267
Listen, don't worry. I'm fine.

32:31.268 --> 32:33.394
OK. OK, you're OK.

32:33.395 --> 32:35.229
- Yeah. We're OK.
- I'm OK.

32:35.230 --> 32:37.189
You're alive!

32:37.190 --> 32:39.441
I mean, I hit you with my car,

32:39.442 --> 32:41.986
the least I could do is
give you a ride home.

32:41.987 --> 32:45.990
Don't worry about it.
It's only a little car, isn't it?

32:45.991 --> 32:47.783
Oh, my God.
Are you going to sue me?

32:47.784 --> 32:51.537
No! No, gosh, no. Good
Lord, I'd never sue.

32:51.538 --> 32:53.664
You know we're not... As a society,

32:53.665 --> 32:56.125
we're not really big
suers, you know?

32:56.126 --> 32:58.669
We don't... We don't do it.

32:58.670 --> 33:00.880
God, you're rambling. Are you OK?

33:00.881 --> 33:02.590
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

33:02.591 --> 33:04.550
- No, I'm fine.
- OK, what's my name?

33:04.551 --> 33:06.799
- Do you remember my name?
- Julio.

33:12.517 --> 33:16.020
Oh, there's the culprit.

33:16.021 --> 33:17.813
- Oh.
- The cassette of death.

33:17.814 --> 33:20.816
<i>La casete de muerte.</i>

33:20.817 --> 33:24.778
Ah, Tito Puente, Willie
Colón, Ray Barretto.

33:24.779 --> 33:29.408
Oh, yes, let's just put that
somewhere else far, far away.

33:29.409 --> 33:31.452
It's uh...

33:32.037 --> 33:36.206
I salsa, OK? I'm into salsa.

33:36.207 --> 33:38.792
In fact, I was on my
way to salsa class,

33:38.793 --> 33:42.504
which is why I was willing
to kill a man to get there,

33:42.505 --> 33:45.049
so that's how much I like salsa.

33:51.806 --> 33:53.766
All right, so you've
entered total shock.

33:53.767 --> 33:56.561
Are you in a state of shock now?

33:57.562 --> 33:59.514
I... I salsa.

34:00.690 --> 34:03.484
Ah.

34:10.199 --> 34:12.159
Right, sure you do.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.408
Wow, now I'm really worried
about you. Are you OK?

34:16.623 --> 34:18.748
Did Helen tell you about
the, uh, bowling?

34:18.750 --> 34:21.502
'Cause we're going to do this
whole bowling-bonding thing

34:21.503 --> 34:23.587
if you want to come.

34:23.588 --> 34:27.549
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
definitely. Definitely.

34:27.550 --> 34:31.094
I like bowling. I was...
I was born to bowl, really.

34:31.096 --> 34:35.301
Born to bowl, wow.
That's a big statement.

34:52.574 --> 34:54.909
One more time and...

34:54.911 --> 34:57.621
One, two, three, five, six, seven.

34:57.622 --> 35:00.541
Let's try that one more time.
Ready and one...

35:00.542 --> 35:04.211
Oh, you, whatever your name is.

35:04.212 --> 35:09.550
My name is Bruce Garrett and
I'm here to learn salsa.

35:09.551 --> 35:13.178
Well, very nice to meet you, Bruce.
We're walking through some basics.

35:13.179 --> 35:18.267
Ready and one, two, three,
to the side, six, seven.

35:18.268 --> 35:21.768
Forward and turn. Back and shimmy.

35:22.230 --> 35:26.692
One more time and...
one, two, three, five, six, seven.

35:26.693 --> 35:29.862
Forward and turn, back and shimmy.

35:29.863 --> 35:32.197
Nice one, Bruce.

35:32.198 --> 35:35.993
Let's try that again. Ready
and five, six, seven, go!

35:35.994 --> 35:38.822
Turn! Shimmy!

35:39.330 --> 35:40.577
One more time.

35:47.881 --> 35:50.591
Yeah, thank you.

35:50.592 --> 35:54.178
Well done, everyone. <i>Muy bien.</i>

35:54.179 --> 35:57.097
See you next week. Thank you
very much, guys. Thank you.

35:57.098 --> 35:59.183
Woo.

35:59.184 --> 36:01.478
Ah.

36:03.104 --> 36:05.306
- I love this.
- Hey.

36:06.107 --> 36:08.358
I just wanted to say sorry
for being rude to you.

36:08.359 --> 36:11.612
Yes, you were.
You were very rude to me.

36:11.613 --> 36:14.441
You were kind of a pig to
me, actually, a rude pig.

36:16.159 --> 36:20.245
I'm kidding with you. God!
My name is Bejan, nice to meet you.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.498
- I'm Bruce.
- Bruce, hi.

36:22.499 --> 36:24.625
Bejan is actually my middle name.

36:24.626 --> 36:26.835
My full name is Ali
Reza Bejan Ahmadzadeh.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.962
Wow, a bit of a mouthful, innit?

36:28.963 --> 36:31.757
Yes. Bejan means hero.

36:31.758 --> 36:33.926
- Ah, that's nice.
- What does Bruce mean?

36:34.511 --> 36:40.349
Uh, Bruce, I think it comes from the
old Saxon meaning bush or hedge.

36:40.350 --> 36:42.427
Mm.

36:43.103 --> 36:44.812
We're all hitting the
club if you want to...

36:44.813 --> 36:48.187
- Oh, right.
- Boteco. It's hot shit.

36:48.733 --> 36:54.113
The dance floor, fully programmable
LED ester and black glass.

36:54.114 --> 36:56.406
- Wow. Semi-sprung?
- Yes, please.

36:56.407 --> 37:00.111
Mm, it would be like
dancing on a glass pillow.

37:01.121 --> 37:04.123
- You want to come? Take my number.
- I don't know.

37:04.124 --> 37:05.874
- You don't want to take my number?
- Not your number.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.668
You don't have to take my
number if you don't want it.

37:07.669 --> 37:10.045
I can walk in the other direction.
Plenty of other people to speak to.

37:10.046 --> 37:11.630
I'm sure one of them
want my number.

37:11.631 --> 37:13.799
- I didn't mean that.
- I'm fucking with you again!

37:13.800 --> 37:17.174
Get a sense of humour,
for God's sake! Wait there.

37:19.722 --> 37:22.349
I'm going to give you
my direct number, OK?

37:22.350 --> 37:28.480
You call me on this any time
between 5:30 and quarter to six.

37:28.481 --> 37:31.309
That's a.m. I'm a morning person.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.483
Thank you.

37:35.655 --> 37:38.782
- I tracked down Ron Parfitt.
- Oh, my God. What's he like?

37:38.783 --> 37:42.077
Exactly the same. Just a
horrible, grumpy, old bastard.

37:42.078 --> 37:44.872
Holy shit, Bruce. This is huge.

37:47.417 --> 37:48.917
Is this for her?

37:48.918 --> 37:52.337
"Is this for her?"
Yes, it's for her.

37:52.338 --> 37:55.792
I'm thinking about asking
her to maybe dance with me.

37:56.176 --> 37:58.260
That sounds good, so
what happens next?

37:58.261 --> 38:00.387
- I'm just going go ask her.
- Wrong.

38:00.388 --> 38:02.848
No, no, no. You don't go straight
in with a big romantic gesture

38:02.849 --> 38:04.516
until you've done the groundwork.

38:04.517 --> 38:06.935
She's like a blank wall, Bruce.

38:06.936 --> 38:08.437
Firstly, you have to
apply the primer,

38:08.438 --> 38:10.230
then the undercoat and then
you go in with the emulsion.

38:10.231 --> 38:13.275
What kind of wall?
It might not need primer.

38:13.276 --> 38:14.735
I'm serious, Bruce.

38:14.736 --> 38:17.815
You can't go and ask her out
until you've done the undercoat.

39:12.001 --> 39:15.420
Fantastic, that's just tremendous.
Hey, Bruce.

39:15.421 --> 39:18.173
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, man.

39:18.174 --> 39:20.175
You look nice, but you know what?

39:20.176 --> 39:23.428
I'm already, er, sorted
with a phone plan.

39:25.390 --> 39:28.560
Bruce, you need your shoes otherwise
you're gonna miss out on this frame.

39:29.185 --> 39:31.520
- Good luck.
- All right, here we go.

39:31.521 --> 39:33.098
Phone shop.

39:34.357 --> 39:36.108
- Oh.
- Oh.

39:36.109 --> 39:38.562
Here comes the dirty thunder.

39:40.446 --> 39:42.948
Oh, the Gaelic gale.

39:42.949 --> 39:46.494
- Huh? I hit seven, I think.
- Move over.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.998
Oh.

39:50.999 --> 39:52.541
- Never mind.
- Pump it up.

39:52.542 --> 39:55.168
Amazing. Ah.

39:55.169 --> 39:58.672
Can I just give you a little bit
of constructive feedback?

39:58.673 --> 40:01.717
- Yeah, please do.
- Oh, yeah.

40:01.718 --> 40:05.470
Well, uh, I've noticed a
little flaw in your game.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.389
OK, listen, I think I know
what you're going to say.

40:07.390 --> 40:09.474
This probably is about me

40:09.475 --> 40:13.395
continually rolling the balls into
the recess gutters, isn't it?

40:13.396 --> 40:16.356
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah. I think...

40:16.357 --> 40:18.817
I think it's the only weakness
in my game, you know?

40:18.818 --> 40:22.612
It is. It is the only weakness,
but, uh, it's a pretty major one.

40:22.613 --> 40:24.990
- Yeah, it's a biggy.
- So let's deal with it.

40:24.991 --> 40:27.743
Here, I'll show you. Come on.

40:27.744 --> 40:30.823
Oh! Sumba, bunga, wunga!

40:31.331 --> 40:33.204
Did you see that?

40:34.250 --> 40:36.293
So you put your
fingers in the holes.

40:37.086 --> 40:40.130
No. No, no, no, no.
No innuendo, OK?

40:40.131 --> 40:43.342
The first rule of bowling is
there's holes and there's balls

40:43.343 --> 40:45.344
and we're all adults.
We just have to get over it.

40:45.345 --> 40:47.846
- Let's bowl.
- Yup.

40:47.847 --> 40:49.681
Hold your ball like a baby.

40:49.682 --> 40:51.892
- Throw it like a rocket.
- Yup.

40:51.893 --> 40:55.145
Hold it like a baby.
Throw it like a rocket, yeah?

40:55.146 --> 40:57.223
Yeah.

40:58.232 --> 41:01.777
Hold it like a baby and then
I throw it like a rocket.

41:01.778 --> 41:05.364
I hold it like a baby and then
I throw it like a rocket.

41:05.365 --> 41:08.489
Hold it like a baby and then
I throw it like a rocket.

41:10.370 --> 41:12.662
Sorry. Sorry.

41:12.663 --> 41:14.456
I'm calling social services.

41:14.457 --> 41:16.458
You're calling social services?

41:16.459 --> 41:19.162
Why? Has he been within
100 metres of a school?

41:23.925 --> 41:26.093
- You're up, Jules.
- Oh.

41:26.094 --> 41:28.428
Go on, Julio, if that's your name.

41:28.429 --> 41:31.598
Listen, you just focus on
your baby rocket big shot.

41:31.599 --> 41:33.433
Yeah.

41:33.434 --> 41:36.728
All right. Let's do this.

41:36.729 --> 41:38.647
Come on, baby ball.

41:38.648 --> 41:41.900
- I just need one strike.
- Oh, wow.

41:41.901 --> 41:44.569
Have you seen the pants
on that guy over there?

41:47.573 --> 41:49.400
- Go on.
- Here we go.

41:51.411 --> 41:53.745
Did you end up keeping the shoes
or you gave them back or...?

41:53.746 --> 41:57.707
- No, I gave them back.
- I thought they really suited you.

41:57.708 --> 41:59.709
Ah, do you mind if I
just put my seat back?

41:59.710 --> 42:02.421
- Oh, there's not much room here.
- It's just I've got such long legs.

42:02.422 --> 42:04.420
Oh! That's better.

42:04.924 --> 42:09.755
Bruce, we'll drop you off first.
All that exercise, you must be exhausted.

42:17.061 --> 42:19.271
- Bye, Bruce.
- See you later, Brucie.

42:19.272 --> 42:22.692
Loving the pad. Let's
get this party started.

42:46.883 --> 42:49.134
Bruce!

42:49.135 --> 42:51.386
Bruce!

42:51.387 --> 42:53.847
- Bruce!
- Hey, shut up.

42:53.848 --> 42:56.641
My God, I thought it was number 4
and then I thought it's number 14

42:56.642 --> 42:58.602
and then I thought it was
number 40 and then I went to 14

42:58.603 --> 43:00.312
and then I went to 40,
but there isn't a 40.

43:00.313 --> 43:02.898
- How are you doing?
- I'm good. Hello.

43:02.899 --> 43:06.193
- One more for me.
- You want a drink?

43:06.194 --> 43:07.819
- Do you have any Fanta?
- I do not.

43:07.820 --> 43:11.490
That's a shame, because I do!

43:11.491 --> 43:14.367
Ooh. Wow. I'll get glasses.

43:14.368 --> 43:17.662
No, no, no, it's not a wedding.
You drink from the bottle.

43:17.663 --> 43:19.915
- Erm... thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

43:19.916 --> 43:22.665
<i>- Salamati.
- Ah, salamati</i>

43:23.878 --> 43:26.630
- Mm.
- Mm. Urgh, it's flat.

43:26.631 --> 43:29.591
It's not flat. It's still.
It's still Fanta.

43:29.592 --> 43:31.718
- They don't do still Fanta.
- They don't do still Fanta.

43:31.719 --> 43:34.387
I have to make my own. You just open
the bottle. Put it on the balcony.

43:34.388 --> 43:36.806
Two days later, boom, shake
the room, yes please.

43:36.807 --> 43:38.850
- Ha.
- Mm.

43:38.851 --> 43:41.728
Are you ready?
Do you want to go? Let's go.

43:41.729 --> 43:43.931
You're going like this?

43:45.608 --> 43:48.610
Yeah. What's the matter with this?

43:48.611 --> 43:50.438
Well...

43:51.906 --> 43:53.365
everything

43:53.366 --> 43:55.700
What are these?

43:55.701 --> 43:57.911
- Shirts.
- Polyester mix?

43:57.912 --> 44:01.623
I'm thinking 50% polyester,
20% Crimplene, 5% wool, yes?

44:01.624 --> 44:03.747
- Sure.
- It's bullshit.

44:04.460 --> 44:08.547
Silk, smart, casual, breathable.

44:08.548 --> 44:10.000
Yes, please.

44:10.716 --> 44:13.718
Cotton, soaks up
sweat like a sponge.

44:13.719 --> 44:15.045
Vest up, my friend.

44:15.888 --> 44:19.592
Linen, flyweight for quicker
movements, show off those turns.

44:20.768 --> 44:23.979
Synthetic, less friction
means fewer blisters.

44:23.980 --> 44:26.314
Unless you like blister. Do you
like blister? Who likes blister?

44:26.315 --> 44:28.316
- Pilgrims.
- Exactly.

44:30.778 --> 44:33.026
Who's that?
Can you hold that a second?

44:34.073 --> 44:36.324
What's going on?
Not taking my calls?

44:36.325 --> 44:41.663
- Just busy. I've been busy at work.
- Three words. The Velvet Pussycat.

44:41.664 --> 44:44.124
- What, now?
- Yeah, come on. Get changed.

44:44.125 --> 44:46.828
- It's a Tuesday night.
- Yeah, exactly.

44:48.170 --> 44:50.505
Bruce, do you have any
idea how hard I've worked

44:50.506 --> 44:52.674
- to get Amanda to take up a hobby.
- Mm.

44:52.675 --> 44:56.094
I've been masterminding Project
Pilates for six months.

44:56.095 --> 44:58.096
Why do you think that is?

44:58.097 --> 45:02.309
Two whole hours of freedom,
8:30 to 10:30, once a week.

45:02.310 --> 45:05.186
What do you think I'm going to do
with that time, sit indoors wanking?

45:05.187 --> 45:06.730
I can do that when she's at home.

45:07.231 --> 45:09.524
I'm just... I'm bushed, you know?

45:09.525 --> 45:11.610
I'm just going to have a
bath and hit the hay.

45:11.611 --> 45:12.812
A bath?

45:13.487 --> 45:16.698
Oh, that's nice. Will it have
nice little bubbles in it?

45:16.699 --> 45:19.576
- Who are you talking to?
- Eh? Who's this?

45:19.577 --> 45:22.537
Hi. My name is Bejan.
Pleased to meet you.

45:22.538 --> 45:26.291
- It's a mate from work.
- Mate? Oh, my God. I'm honoured.

45:26.292 --> 45:28.835
- All right.
- It's a big, big moment for me.

45:28.836 --> 45:31.671
Well, I'll leave you to your bath.

45:31.672 --> 45:33.840
We weren't having a group.
We weren't going to do group.

45:33.841 --> 45:37.302
He was going to go and I was going
to have a bath. Please don't. Don't.

45:37.303 --> 45:40.552
Don't worry. It's fine.
I'll er... I'll go by myself.

45:41.599 --> 45:44.059
- I'll give you a call later, yeah?
- Yeah.

45:44.060 --> 45:46.019
Bye, Gary!

45:46.020 --> 45:47.813
He's cute.

45:48.773 --> 45:51.983
Two more things, your
hairy chest and a tan.

45:51.984 --> 45:55.028
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

45:55.029 --> 45:57.357
- No, no.
- Bruce, what year is this?

45:57.782 --> 46:01.201
Did we just go back in time?
Did we step out of the De Lorean?

46:01.202 --> 46:03.871
Are we in 1985?
Is this Hill Valley?

46:05.456 --> 46:07.248
Think McFly! Think!

46:07.249 --> 46:09.668
- Ow.
- Sorry, I just wanted to...

46:09.669 --> 46:11.920
So take this...

46:11.921 --> 46:13.623
- and take this.
- Fine.

46:14.090 --> 46:15.840
You've got ten minutes.

46:15.841 --> 46:17.509
Run for it, Marty!

46:24.684 --> 46:26.852
Ah. Oh.

46:32.775 --> 46:35.148
Wow. It's so deep.

46:39.323 --> 46:40.945
So natural.

46:48.332 --> 46:50.159
How do you feel?

46:51.919 --> 46:53.166
Thank you.

46:53.838 --> 46:59.636
And on the 7th day, the Almighty
turned to his followers and said...

47:03.889 --> 47:06.933
- What does that mean?
- Let's salsa.

47:47.183 --> 47:50.887
- Oh. He's grinding her batty.
- Yeah, he is.

47:52.688 --> 47:54.606
Yeah!

48:14.627 --> 48:18.588
Oh, look. Look.

48:20.174 --> 48:23.548
- That looks fun.
- Oh my God. They make me feel sick.

48:24.512 --> 48:26.346
Salsa aerobics?

48:26.347 --> 48:28.556
It's not a salsa. It is a cancer.

48:28.557 --> 48:31.306
Go back to the leisure
centre, you bitches!

48:32.353 --> 48:34.562
- If I had a grenade right now...
- Shut up.

48:34.563 --> 48:36.147
- I was just saying...
- A Middle Eastern man

48:36.148 --> 48:37.899
talking about a grenade
in a packed night club.

48:37.900 --> 48:41.486
- You'll start a bloody stampede.
- I'm saying if I had a grenade.

48:41.487 --> 48:44.611
- Of course I don't have a grenade.
- Shush.

48:45.491 --> 48:48.820
- Another Fanta.
- Let's have another Fanta.

48:51.831 --> 48:53.456
- Hi, guys.
- Hey!

48:53.457 --> 48:55.750
- So who's dancing?
- Oh, yes, please.

48:55.751 --> 48:58.211
- Bruce.
- No, I'm going to sit this one out.

48:58.212 --> 49:00.414
- I don't think so. Come on.
- Oh, please.

49:01.173 --> 49:03.967
- Hi, Ron.
- Hey, are you all right?

49:24.822 --> 49:27.949
Off. Off. Off.

49:27.950 --> 49:29.492
What?

49:29.493 --> 49:33.121
Get off this fucking dance floor
with your shitty dancing.

49:33.122 --> 49:35.665
- I was doing the steps.
- Doing the steps?

49:35.666 --> 49:38.870
Any prick can do the steps.
That prick can do the steps.

49:40.087 --> 49:43.840
Where's the fucking heart?
Where's <i>el corazón?</i>

49:43.841 --> 49:45.675
- I don't know.
- What's that?

49:45.676 --> 49:47.218
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

49:47.219 --> 49:50.138
Well, in that case, why don't
you piss off back to the bar,

49:50.139 --> 49:54.601
grab yourself a pint of bitter and
watch like all the fucking losers?

49:54.602 --> 49:56.304
Don't.

50:53.619 --> 50:55.954
Scrub it off of me.

50:55.955 --> 50:58.374
This filthy tan.

51:04.254 --> 51:06.464
- Big news, ball bag.
- What?

51:06.465 --> 51:10.176
Shift. When you were at home last
night making love to your hand,

51:10.177 --> 51:15.098
guess who went disco dancing with
the sexually-frustrated lady boss.

51:15.099 --> 51:17.308
- Who?
- Me. I did.

51:17.309 --> 51:20.561
- Yeah, got that.
- Oh, my God. She can move.

51:20.562 --> 51:23.272
And the sweat dripping off of her,

51:23.273 --> 51:26.567
it was like a waterfall
of babies' tears.

51:26.568 --> 51:28.611
Mm, poetic.

51:29.363 --> 51:32.323
Ah, I think we all know
where this is headed.

51:32.324 --> 51:34.075
Inside of her.

51:34.076 --> 51:35.869
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

51:37.746 --> 51:40.581
- Why are you telling me all this?
- Don't be a virgin.

51:40.582 --> 51:42.750
- I know you made a play for her.
- No, I didn't.

51:43.752 --> 51:47.046
A mix tape? Are you
fucking John Cusack now?

51:47.047 --> 51:49.215
You took it.

51:49.216 --> 51:52.010
I didn't want you to be embarrassed.
She'd laugh in your face.

51:52.011 --> 51:54.137
I made it for her car.

51:54.138 --> 51:56.139
- Just give me it, will you?
- Your big arms are too slow.

51:56.140 --> 51:58.099
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Jules.

51:58.100 --> 52:00.852
- How's it going?
- Really good. Really good.

52:00.853 --> 52:02.270
Last night was fun, right?

52:02.271 --> 52:04.188
- So much fun.
- Yeah, it was good.

52:04.189 --> 52:06.649
Helen was obviously trying
to hustle us all, but...

52:06.650 --> 52:09.652
Yeah, it was a good night.

52:09.653 --> 52:12.363
How are your little footsies?

52:12.364 --> 52:15.742
- You know what? Pretty sore.
- I'll bet they are.

52:15.743 --> 52:18.119
We, uh, stopped off at a
club on the way home.

52:18.120 --> 52:20.038
That's right.

52:20.039 --> 52:22.373
I'm going to go.
I've got things to do.

52:22.374 --> 52:25.043
- See you later, Brucie.
- Bye, Bruce.

52:35.262 --> 52:37.885
Drew! Ow!

52:39.141 --> 52:40.975
Oh, shit.

52:40.976 --> 52:44.812
Oh, shit. Oh.

52:44.813 --> 52:47.857
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, just having a manicure.

52:47.858 --> 52:50.607
- This came. Will you sign for it?
- Sure.

52:51.570 --> 52:54.273
Can you... Sorry.

52:58.994 --> 53:00.912
- Thank you. Cheers.
- Thanks.

53:00.913 --> 53:03.498
Can I, um...

53:03.499 --> 53:06.498
Oh, this is bad.

53:07.336 --> 53:09.789
Help.

53:10.380 --> 53:12.590
- That was so fun.
- Yeah.

53:12.591 --> 53:15.259
- We should do it again.
- Yeah, maybe.

53:15.260 --> 53:17.011
What's erm... What's with the tape?

53:17.012 --> 53:19.180
Oh, shoot.

53:20.099 --> 53:23.394
You caught me.
Er, it's for your car.

53:23.936 --> 53:27.265
Oh, my God. You made an inlay.

53:27.981 --> 53:29.482
Yes, I did.

53:29.483 --> 53:31.400
Nobody makes inlays anymore.

53:31.401 --> 53:35.113
Yeah, it's just a silly, little
touch I thought you'd like.

53:35.114 --> 53:38.241
That's really...
That's really nice.

53:38.242 --> 53:40.660
Now I feel like I have
to get you something.

53:40.661 --> 53:43.204
That would be so cute.

53:43.205 --> 53:45.453
That's really nice. Thank you.

53:56.260 --> 53:58.633
- How was your bubble bath?
- Ha-ha!

54:00.931 --> 54:04.100
- Was it rejuvenating?
- That's classic, Gary, classic.

54:04.101 --> 54:06.561
Listen, I love the craic.

54:06.562 --> 54:08.896
One might say I'm
addicted to the craic,

54:08.897 --> 54:11.357
but right now I just
want to get my head down

54:11.358 --> 54:14.562
and plough my way through this
bucket of balls, all right?

54:15.696 --> 54:16.988
Yeah?

54:16.989 --> 54:19.157
I think we've got a new heading
for our weekly roundup.

54:19.158 --> 54:24.159
Unexplained homoerotic encounters
with rugged foreign males. Mickey?

54:24.580 --> 54:27.707
- Nil.
- Me, nil. Brucie?

54:27.708 --> 54:30.501
Ah, fuck the weekly roundup.

54:30.502 --> 54:32.170
Fuck it.

54:32.171 --> 54:34.373
Oh, dear. What's wrong with her?

54:35.549 --> 54:37.967
Come on, Bruce. Who was he?

54:37.968 --> 54:40.387
- What are you hiding from us?
- Nothing.

54:42.890 --> 54:44.265
Aw.

54:44.266 --> 54:48.477
Did the sexy sultan's rich bath
milk irritate your sensitive skin?

54:48.478 --> 54:50.897
- Fuck off.
- Oh!

54:50.898 --> 54:53.232
Hey, are you all right, Gary? Gary?

54:53.233 --> 54:55.484
- I'm sorry. Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine mate.

54:55.485 --> 54:58.689
- Yeah, forget about it.
- Hey, hey, hey. Don't go.

55:00.908 --> 55:03.576
Yeah, this is the one, the
trusty arsehole wedge.

55:03.577 --> 55:06.412
Hey, hey. Don't... Gary, don't...

55:06.413 --> 55:10.291
Stop it. Stop. Oh! Gary! Oh!
Gary, don't!

55:10.292 --> 55:12.293
- You keep running!
- Gary!

55:12.294 --> 55:14.003
- Right.
- Help me!

55:14.004 --> 55:15.501
Par three!

55:15.923 --> 55:19.172
- Argh!
- Or should I say par arsehole!

55:19.635 --> 55:22.762
I didn't mean to hit
you, Gary! Please!

55:22.763 --> 55:24.555
Keep running!

55:24.556 --> 55:26.724
Ah!

55:26.725 --> 55:29.098
Oh! Oi!

55:30.312 --> 55:32.514
- Stop it!
- Ah!

55:34.358 --> 55:36.651
Argh! Oi!

55:36.652 --> 55:39.526
- I dance!
- Fore!

55:41.573 --> 55:43.525
I dance, all right?

55:45.202 --> 55:47.871
Please stop hitting balls at me.

55:49.665 --> 55:51.123
Wee!

55:51.124 --> 55:53.247
Salsa?

55:54.211 --> 55:56.754
- With the little shoes?
- Yes.

55:56.755 --> 55:58.957
Yes, salsa with the little shoes.

56:02.761 --> 56:04.053
Why?

56:05.222 --> 56:07.640
I was doing it for that girl.

56:07.641 --> 56:11.220
- What girl?
- The... the butterfly.

56:11.561 --> 56:13.187
The eponymous butterfly

56:13.188 --> 56:15.982
from the "Tale of the
Butterfly and the Parsnip".

56:16.900 --> 56:19.398
- The parsnip, the butterfly.
- Oh.

56:20.529 --> 56:23.698
What, you thought the parsnip
would win the butterfly

56:23.699 --> 56:25.866
by doing a bit of
tiny shoe shuffle?

56:25.867 --> 56:29.241
Yes. I know. It's stupid, isn't it?

56:30.247 --> 56:33.374
And then there's Drew.
Do you remember Drew?

56:33.375 --> 56:35.710
Oh, yes, that horse's arse.

56:35.711 --> 56:38.296
Yeah. Well, he likes her, too.

56:38.297 --> 56:42.422
He might be a horse's arse, but he's
better at all this than I am so...

56:43.218 --> 56:45.420
I might just let him
get on with it.

56:46.221 --> 56:50.099
Yeah, mate, just...
It's probably for the best.

56:50.100 --> 56:53.304
Just... just forget about her, eh?

57:11.413 --> 57:13.365
He's back.

57:14.207 --> 57:17.084
Jesus Christ, Ron.
You fuckin' made me jump.

57:17.085 --> 57:18.707
Who is she, Bruce?

57:19.171 --> 57:20.748
Mm?

57:21.256 --> 57:26.510
The girl in the club the other
night, she's the one, hm?

57:26.511 --> 57:29.013
- It doesn't matter.
- No, of course, it doesn't matter.

57:29.014 --> 57:31.766
That's why you've got a
face like a dropped scone.

57:31.767 --> 57:35.061
It's just stupid. I wanted to
make her fall in love with me.

57:35.062 --> 57:38.856
Mm... and then along comes this other
fella... tall, better looking...

57:38.857 --> 57:41.606
Let's face it. His dick
couldn't be any smaller.

57:43.653 --> 57:48.154
That's why you came back.
<i>La doña,</i> the woman.

57:49.326 --> 57:51.077
It's salsa, Ron.

57:51.078 --> 57:53.120
- It's always about a woman.
- Mm-hmm.

57:53.121 --> 57:55.748
I just wanted you to make
me good enough for her.

57:55.749 --> 57:57.708
Why don't you just keep standing
in front of that mirror

57:57.709 --> 57:59.335
and do what you did in the
club the other night?

57:59.336 --> 58:01.962
- Do me a favour and do that.
- What?

58:01.963 --> 58:05.132
Oh, come on. You know
what you did. You felt it.

58:05.133 --> 58:09.258
- You want me to do it now?
- Come on. It's just us girls, Brucie.

58:09.679 --> 58:11.680
I don't want to.

58:11.681 --> 58:13.641
- Oh, he bottles it.
- Bottles?

58:13.642 --> 58:15.936
What a surprise.

58:18.730 --> 58:20.773
- Where are you going?
- Come on. We got work to do.

58:20.774 --> 58:21.941
What kind of work?

58:21.942 --> 58:25.146
We're going to get shit-faced
and play board games.

58:28.615 --> 58:31.033
- Eye piece for one eye?
- Monocle.

58:31.034 --> 58:32.535
Mm.

58:32.536 --> 58:34.787
Sorry, why are we doing this again?

58:34.788 --> 58:37.662
- Sits on top of a Christmas tree?
- A fairy.

58:38.250 --> 58:40.209
No, a star.

58:40.210 --> 58:42.420
- That's time.
- Oh, all right.

58:42.421 --> 58:44.874
- That's for you.
- Go.

58:45.799 --> 58:50.010
OK, they ate this much to God's
annoyance in the Garden of Eden.

58:50.011 --> 58:51.971
- Apple.
- Apple is correct.

58:51.972 --> 58:54.473
Oh, OK, he... Um, he's a an actor.

58:54.474 --> 58:56.475
- He does films.
- It's a purple one.

58:56.476 --> 58:58.849
- Yeah and?
- You have to do an impression.

58:59.563 --> 59:01.522
I'm not doing an impression.

59:01.523 --> 59:03.649
- Well, you have to.
- No.

59:03.650 --> 59:05.776
- Do the impression, Bruce.
- No, I can't.

59:05.777 --> 59:08.947
- Just do the impression.
- No, I'm not doing an impression.

59:09.489 --> 59:12.317
- What are you so scared of, eh?
- I'm not.

59:12.993 --> 59:14.827
- Just do the impression, then.
- No, I'm not doing...

59:14.828 --> 59:16.537
Why are you so afraid of
what people might think?

59:16.538 --> 59:18.497
Why can't you put
yourself out there?

59:18.498 --> 59:20.207
- I mean...
- So do the impression.

59:20.208 --> 59:22.293
- It's almost time.
- Do the impression.

59:22.294 --> 59:25.504
- That's it. Time.
- Do the fucking impression!

59:25.505 --> 59:29.508
- Why are you always shouting at me?
- Because you fucking quit on me.

59:29.509 --> 59:32.386
- I did not quit.
- You had the world at your feet.

59:32.387 --> 59:34.805
- I did not quit.
- And you walked away, didn't you?

59:34.806 --> 59:36.307
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did.

59:36.308 --> 59:38.893
You keep swanning back in
here and swanning out again.

59:38.894 --> 59:42.146
- Swanning back in...
- They broke me. All right?

59:42.147 --> 59:45.274
If you want to know, the night of
the competition, they broke me.

59:45.275 --> 59:48.652
A gang of kids, bullies, they just...
they broke it out of me.

59:48.653 --> 59:52.656
- I didn't want to do it anymore!
- Some big boys gave you a shoeing.

59:52.657 --> 59:55.701
You're a male dancer.
Do you think I never took any shit?

59:55.702 --> 59:57.495
So what are you going
to do about it, eh?

59:57.496 --> 01:00:00.498
Are you going to hide away,
or maybe crawl under your duvet

01:00:00.499 --> 01:00:04.420
and watch "Bridget Jones Part
Two" with some white Maltesers?

01:00:05.128 --> 01:00:06.545
Don't.

01:00:07.506 --> 01:00:09.583
Then what?

01:00:11.426 --> 01:00:13.260
- Then what?
- I don't know!

01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:15.137
So do the fucking impression!

01:00:15.138 --> 01:00:17.223
- Say hello to my little friend.
- Again.

01:00:17.224 --> 01:00:18.933
- Say hello to my little...
- Again!

01:00:18.934 --> 01:00:20.518
- Say hello to my...
- Again!

01:00:20.519 --> 01:00:22.479
Say hello to my little friend!

01:00:22.812 --> 01:00:25.515
- Al Pa-fucking-cino
- Yes!

01:00:26.441 --> 01:00:29.902
So... shall we go and dance
in front of the mirror?

01:00:29.903 --> 01:00:32.356
Yeah.

01:00:33.114 --> 01:00:36.033
Yes. That is time.

01:00:37.118 --> 01:00:39.078
Get the shoulders. Loosen up.

01:00:39.079 --> 01:00:43.123
That's it. Loosen up.
Roll those shoulders. Roll them.

01:00:43.124 --> 01:00:45.418
Roll them. Roll them.

01:00:46.545 --> 01:00:48.747
Arms of an eagle.

01:00:50.423 --> 01:00:52.925
I said an eagle, not
a fucking heron.

01:00:52.926 --> 01:00:55.128
It is an eagle.

01:00:56.263 --> 01:00:58.636
OK, try again. Legs of a stallion.

01:00:59.766 --> 01:01:01.183
Arms of an eagle.

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:04.938
Go.

01:01:10.235 --> 01:01:12.486
That's it. Work it out, Brucie.

01:01:12.487 --> 01:01:14.564
Go on, Garrett.

01:01:18.201 --> 01:01:21.200
Takes a lot of hard work
to make it look that easy.

01:01:22.372 --> 01:01:23.994
- Mm.
- All right.

01:01:35.969 --> 01:01:37.671
Think about it all the time.

01:01:40.807 --> 01:01:43.684
Now, I know you're all waiting
for this particular model,

01:01:43.685 --> 01:01:46.604
but as we say, better
lathe than never.

01:01:49.941 --> 01:01:51.768
All right, so...

01:01:57.449 --> 01:01:59.447
One, two, three, four...

01:02:05.665 --> 01:02:07.416
- What is that?
- What?

01:02:07.417 --> 01:02:09.836
- That's chicken stuff.
- It's reggaeton.

01:02:23.725 --> 01:02:26.268
- Three, two, one and down.
- Ow!

01:02:26.269 --> 01:02:27.936
- You all right?
- Ow.

01:02:27.937 --> 01:02:30.060
I'm so sorry. Someone's coming.

01:02:53.213 --> 01:02:55.923
Whoa, whoa! Room for a small one?

01:02:55.924 --> 01:02:57.883
I have a question for you.

01:02:57.884 --> 01:02:59.843
Well, I love questions.

01:02:59.844 --> 01:03:02.217
So you like Latin music, huh?

01:03:04.057 --> 01:03:07.101
- The mix tape.
- Oh, right, the mix, yes.

01:03:07.102 --> 01:03:11.939
Oh, I am a Latino boy big
time, I am, music wise.

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:14.983
Thanks for listening to that.
It was a real labour of love for me.

01:03:14.984 --> 01:03:19.321
That track at the end
of side one, oh...

01:03:19.322 --> 01:03:23.575
Oh, shoot, that's the...
That's my favourite track.

01:03:23.576 --> 01:03:26.078
- Isn't it just so er... tracky?
- It's so...

01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:30.416
And, er, it's the best song that you
could put at the end of side one

01:03:30.417 --> 01:03:33.291
- on a mix tape, like that.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:03:33.712 --> 01:03:38.048
You know what's weird is
whenever I listen to that track,

01:03:38.049 --> 01:03:41.552
I like to imagine myself just
lying in front of a log fire,

01:03:41.553 --> 01:03:45.305
just with a glass of... tequila,

01:03:45.306 --> 01:03:47.929
just chewing on a
chimichanga, you know?

01:03:48.935 --> 01:03:50.769
Oh, hey.

01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:55.357
That pitch that you and Bruce did,
you guys aced it, bam, sold.

01:03:55.358 --> 01:03:57.776
Shut the front door.
You're kidding.

01:03:57.777 --> 01:03:59.987
Stop that train. No, I'm not.

01:03:59.988 --> 01:04:02.239
I'm not.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.616
We should get together
and celebrate.

01:04:04.617 --> 01:04:06.285
- Yes, we should.
- My place.

01:04:06.286 --> 01:04:07.786
- Yes.
- Take-out.

01:04:07.787 --> 01:04:09.955
- Yes.
- Invite Bruce and Helen.

01:04:10.957 --> 01:04:12.909
Yeah.

01:04:13.918 --> 01:04:15.745
We should absolutely do that.

01:04:16.171 --> 01:04:18.005
- Cool, so you'll tell them.
- Yeah.

01:04:18.006 --> 01:04:20.174
- Great.
- Of course. I'll totes tell them.

01:04:20.175 --> 01:04:22.634
You can totally trust
me to do that.

01:04:22.635 --> 01:04:25.805
That's not a problem.

01:04:28.475 --> 01:04:32.102
- Hey. What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

01:04:32.103 --> 01:04:35.398
- What are you hiding?
- Behold.

01:04:35.857 --> 01:04:38.059
<i>Santa Vito.</i>

01:04:39.778 --> 01:04:42.446
What? It's just another
salsa night. So what?

01:04:42.447 --> 01:04:45.783
So what? Look at it squashy chops.

01:04:45.784 --> 01:04:48.533
It's a competition. Sorry.

01:04:49.454 --> 01:04:53.749
Don't you see? This
is your time, Bruce.

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.952
This is the Goonie time.

01:04:56.753 --> 01:04:58.462
Do you know about the Goonie time?

01:04:58.463 --> 01:05:02.591
Of course I know about the Goonie time.
My watch runs on Goonie time.

01:05:02.592 --> 01:05:06.136
So then you know that
it's their time up there,

01:05:06.137 --> 01:05:08.135
but it's our time down here.

01:05:09.682 --> 01:05:12.810
You can do this, Bruce.
You can win this mother-funky

01:05:12.811 --> 01:05:15.935
and you can show the world
what you're really made of.

01:05:16.231 --> 01:05:18.729
Think about it. What
have we go to lose?

01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:23.404
Yeah, I mean, I suppose I could.

01:05:23.822 --> 01:05:26.657
Bruce, we Persians have a saying.

01:05:30.203 --> 01:05:34.122
- I... I don't really speak Farsi.
- If you want to do something do it.

01:05:34.123 --> 01:05:36.325
If you don't want to do it,
don't do it.

01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:42.381
I'm going to be late for my
ball wax. I'll call you later.

01:05:42.382 --> 01:05:44.050
- Yeah, sure.
- OK, bye.

01:05:49.472 --> 01:05:51.424
I can still see you there.

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:54.303
- See you.
- See you later.

01:05:56.813 --> 01:06:00.232
Hello. One, two, three,
four, five. Yes.

01:06:00.233 --> 01:06:02.985
- You win.
- Finally. Finally.

01:06:02.986 --> 01:06:05.737
Now, you know what you get
for first prize, you lucky prick.

01:06:05.738 --> 01:06:07.865
- I dread to think.
- You get one of these.

01:06:07.866 --> 01:06:09.943
- And there it is.
- And...

01:06:12.245 --> 01:06:14.447
two of these.

01:06:16.916 --> 01:06:21.587
I just thought you might want an old
pair of shitty shoes from the '80s.

01:06:21.588 --> 01:06:23.711
One careful owner.

01:06:27.385 --> 01:06:28.886
Thanks, Ron.

01:06:28.887 --> 01:06:31.889
You're not going to try and
finger me now, are you?

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:35.142
- You want me to try and finger you?
- You're ready.

01:06:35.143 --> 01:06:38.222
You... are free.

01:06:39.647 --> 01:06:42.107
I'm going to ask her to
this thing tomorrow night

01:06:42.108 --> 01:06:45.357
and I would be honoured if
you would come and watch us.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.196
Ah, I'll have to check my diary.

01:06:48.197 --> 01:06:49.819
Thank you.

01:06:50.742 --> 01:06:52.784
Look at them.

01:06:52.785 --> 01:06:55.033
- They're so soft
- Mm.

01:06:58.082 --> 01:07:00.250
Don't... Don't do that.

01:07:11.137 --> 01:07:13.305
Come on.

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.148
She's not at work today.

01:07:23.149 --> 01:07:25.192
'Fine, so do it tomorrow.'

01:07:25.193 --> 01:07:29.988
No, I can't. It is tonight, all right?
I have to do it tonight.

01:07:29.989 --> 01:07:32.240
In that case, you are
a tiny bit fucked.

01:07:32.241 --> 01:07:34.952
Sam, please, I really
need you to just help me.

01:07:34.953 --> 01:07:37.913
OK, do exactly as I say
and do not deviate.

01:07:37.914 --> 01:07:40.916
You go home, you shower, you
shave, you put on something nice.

01:07:40.917 --> 01:07:43.001
I'm thinking powder blue,
shirt not trousers.

01:07:43.002 --> 01:07:45.128
Do not put on powder blue trousers.

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:47.631
Then you get a taxi to her house.
Someone will know where she lives.

01:07:47.632 --> 01:07:49.716
You knock on her door.
You knock her off her feet

01:07:49.717 --> 01:07:51.259
with your confident
suggestion of a night out.

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:54.012
She immediately says yes, then
you whisk her off to the club.

01:07:54.013 --> 01:07:56.139
You dance the competition.
You win the competition.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:58.141
We all get shit-faced,
then we all go home, got it?

01:07:58.142 --> 01:08:00.344
Thanks, Sam.

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:06.358
Oh, God, I'm good.

01:08:12.782 --> 01:08:17.118
God, it's so busy in here.
I think I'll use this one.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.371
- All right, ball bag.
- Stupid.

01:08:19.372 --> 01:08:22.624
Just finishing off a little
text to Julie-Jules.

01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:24.960
I told you that she gave me
her mobile number, right?

01:08:24.961 --> 01:08:26.586
Yeah, a few times.

01:08:26.587 --> 01:08:29.840
Ooh, by the way, thanks
for that mixed tape.

01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:31.841
That was a hit.

01:08:31.843 --> 01:08:34.636
- You gave it to her?
- Oh, yeah, she bloody loved it.

01:08:34.636 --> 01:08:36.846
Thought it was very sweet.

01:08:36.848 --> 01:08:39.850
I think I'm going to put it on when
we seal the deal for the first time.

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:42.554
You know, a bit of
sex-muzak, set the mood.

01:08:43.187 --> 01:08:44.604
Don't be jealous, big lad.

01:08:44.604 --> 01:08:47.649
I'm sure she'll still have room in
her life for a fat best friend.

01:08:49.152 --> 01:08:50.604
You don't know about me.

01:08:52.404 --> 01:08:54.656
What don't I know?

01:08:54.657 --> 01:08:55.904
I dance.

01:08:56.408 --> 01:08:58.368
I'm sorry, I thought you
said that "I dance".

01:08:58.368 --> 01:09:00.617
Yeah, I did. I dance salsa.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.000
- You dance salsa?
- Yeah, salsa.

01:09:06.877 --> 01:09:09.462
I would fucking love to see that.

01:09:09.464 --> 01:09:12.008
Maybe you will. Maybe I'll
dance you under the table.

01:09:13.634 --> 01:09:15.926
What sort of table?

01:09:15.928 --> 01:09:17.720
Any sort of table.

01:09:25.063 --> 01:09:27.397
All right, bum flap,
let's settle this like men.

01:09:27.398 --> 01:09:29.441
Winner takes Julia.

01:09:30.859 --> 01:09:32.403
What about HR?

01:09:36.407 --> 01:09:39.952
What happens at lunch
stays at lunch.

01:10:08.231 --> 01:10:10.308
Ow!

01:10:12.401 --> 01:10:14.528
Your wrists are limp.

01:10:14.529 --> 01:10:16.356
- Ooh!
- Your dick is limp.

01:10:19.659 --> 01:10:21.827
Oh, sorry.

01:10:26.249 --> 01:10:29.876
- You learn fast.
- I learn from the best. Julia.

01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:33.171
Sweet, sweet, rest-your-
balls-on-my-chin, Julia.

01:10:33.172 --> 01:10:35.090
- Smell that.
- No.

01:10:38.052 --> 01:10:40.137
Did you just lick my pussy?

01:10:40.138 --> 01:10:42.889
Yeah and you tasted
like a nasty girl.

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:44.933
That's disgusting.

01:10:48.563 --> 01:10:50.310
Wanker!

01:10:53.025 --> 01:10:55.735
I'm wearing the wrong
shoes for this shit.

01:10:55.736 --> 01:10:58.446
- What the fu...
- Coo-ee!

01:10:58.447 --> 01:11:00.699
Where are you?

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.118
I thought you liked banter.

01:11:03.119 --> 01:11:06.323
Oh, fuck off, Bruce. Fuck off.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.881
- Ooh.
- What the... Big mistake.

01:11:15.882 --> 01:11:18.130
That's Jessie the lezzie
from accounts' car.

01:11:27.268 --> 01:11:29.812
Quick step for such meaty thighs.

01:11:37.945 --> 01:11:40.193
Ooh, ooh, do you like that?

01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:44.534
- Wait, no, don't lead me!
- Like a lady.

01:11:44.535 --> 01:11:46.995
- This is wrong. You know it is.
- Like a lady.

01:11:46.996 --> 01:11:49.748
- I'm a man. I'm a fully-grown man.
- Then prove it.

01:11:54.795 --> 01:11:56.296
What is that?

01:11:56.297 --> 01:11:58.295
- That's my phone.
- No, no.

01:12:01.177 --> 01:12:03.428
Huh?

01:12:09.518 --> 01:12:12.346
Ooh! Oh, me blades!

01:12:18.194 --> 01:12:20.195
Oh!

01:12:22.198 --> 01:12:24.491
Whoo!

01:12:24.492 --> 01:12:27.869
Like I said, any sort of table.

01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:30.038
Fine, you win.

01:12:30.039 --> 01:12:32.333
I can't do this every
fucking lunch.

01:12:32.875 --> 01:12:35.752
Doesn't mean that she's
going to pick you, Bruce.

01:12:35.753 --> 01:12:38.213
She wouldn't pick you over me.
That's just bad maths.

01:12:38.214 --> 01:12:40.837
- She's a clever girl.
- Probably right.

01:12:41.342 --> 01:12:44.511
You're quite good-looking.
You've got lovely, long legs.

01:12:44.512 --> 01:12:46.054
- Yeah.
- Nice car.

01:12:46.055 --> 01:12:48.765
- Great car.
- But there is something missing.

01:12:48.766 --> 01:12:51.434
I have got something that you don't have.
Do you know what that is?

01:12:51.435 --> 01:12:54.062
Type 2 diabetes.

01:12:54.063 --> 01:12:55.981
Heart.

01:12:55.982 --> 01:12:57.899
<i>Corazón.</i>

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:03.732
You know, I am Bruce Garret
and I am fucking salsa.

01:13:04.448 --> 01:13:06.650
Get up, bum flap.

01:13:10.579 --> 01:13:14.579
How can you take something so
seriously that's named after a dip?

01:13:52.288 --> 01:13:53.913
- Oh, nice shirt.
- Thank you.

01:13:53.914 --> 01:13:56.041
- Come in.
- No, wait, wait. Please.

01:13:58.336 --> 01:14:03.298
I dance. I dance salsa and there
is this club called Santo Vito...

01:14:03.299 --> 01:14:04.842
- Bruce.
- No, please

01:14:05.551 --> 01:14:09.429
I can hardly breathe. I'm so nervous.
I'm hyperventilating.

01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:11.758
I feel like I can see flies.

01:14:12.516 --> 01:14:15.595
- I don't...
- Let me cut to the chase.

01:14:16.103 --> 01:14:20.228
If you're not doing anything
tonight, I would love to take...

01:14:25.654 --> 01:14:27.864
- Of course.
- Bruce?

01:14:27.865 --> 01:14:31.285
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- Of course, this is...

01:14:32.995 --> 01:14:35.330
- Bruce...
- I'm sorry.

01:14:35.331 --> 01:14:39.876
What do you mean?
No, Bruce, what? Wait. Bruce.

01:14:39.877 --> 01:14:43.456
Come back. Bruce?
Where are you go... Oh.

01:14:45.299 --> 01:14:48.385
Oh, my... Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

01:14:48.386 --> 01:14:51.262
Come on. You know.

01:14:51.263 --> 01:14:54.099
I know? What do I know?

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:58.061
Let's say we skip dinner and
go straight to pudding.

01:14:59.814 --> 01:15:01.311
Are you kidding?

01:15:02.024 --> 01:15:05.652
Yeah. Yeah, totally kidding.

01:15:05.653 --> 01:15:07.237
Just focus on putting
your pants back on.

01:15:07.238 --> 01:15:10.365
OK, I'm not kidding. Here's the thing.
This is where I'm at.

01:15:10.366 --> 01:15:12.951
I just want to be honest with you
because I think you deserve that.

01:15:12.952 --> 01:15:14.452
I'm just going to say this.

01:15:14.453 --> 01:15:16.830
I'm just going to blurt it
out before I lose my nerve.

01:15:16.831 --> 01:15:21.787
- Oh, my God.
- Julia Matthews of America...

01:15:23.129 --> 01:15:28.426
I would be honoured if you
would let me fuck you.

01:15:29.969 --> 01:15:32.137
- Really?
- I just want to...

01:15:32.138 --> 01:15:34.472
I just want to...
I just want to do it.

01:15:36.267 --> 01:15:38.309
Oh, my God.

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:40.603
Just get up and just
get out, please.

01:15:40.604 --> 01:15:42.439
- What?
- Just get out.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.232
Wait. Is this banter?

01:15:44.233 --> 01:15:46.776
I can't believe that
you just dropped trou

01:15:46.777 --> 01:15:48.695
and propositioned your boss.

01:15:48.696 --> 01:15:51.281
- Did you really just do that?
- It was an act of boldness.

01:15:51.282 --> 01:15:54.951
Wait, did you not tell Bruce
about tonight, or Helen?

01:15:54.952 --> 01:15:57.829
- Did I tell Bruce and Helen?
- Was this all part of your plan?

01:15:57.830 --> 01:16:02.083
I can't... I might have.
I don't think I mentioned it.

01:16:02.084 --> 01:16:05.044
All right, this conversation
is definitely over.

01:16:05.045 --> 01:16:07.881
Just please take your
little Italian shoes

01:16:07.882 --> 01:16:10.216
and your pudding and just get out.

01:16:10.217 --> 01:16:12.966
Can I just say I think that
you are making a big mistake?

01:16:13.471 --> 01:16:16.848
I'm going to have you transferred
to plastic mouldings on Monday.

01:16:16.849 --> 01:16:19.767
Oh, that's bullshit! That's
just a bad managerial...

01:16:19.768 --> 01:16:23.313
You know what? FYI I didn't
make that shitty mix tape.

01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:26.316
Oh.

01:16:26.317 --> 01:16:28.359
I'm sorry, Julia.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.405
I said some things, which
may now seem foolish.

01:16:32.406 --> 01:16:37.452
OK, I'm... I'm going to be honest.
My granny died.

01:16:37.453 --> 01:16:40.288
I swear to God, Drew, if you're
still there in 15 seconds,

01:16:40.289 --> 01:16:43.583
I'm going to take your pudding
and shove it right up your ass.

01:16:43.584 --> 01:16:45.752
Uh...

01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:03.433
Bruce.

01:17:10.194 --> 01:17:15.281
Welcome tonight to the <i>Santa
Vito salsa espectáculo</i>. Let's go!

01:17:23.958 --> 01:17:28.586
We're about an hour away from
the main competition event.

01:17:28.587 --> 01:17:30.922
You like it?

01:17:30.923 --> 01:17:32.545
Not really my thing.

01:17:32.925 --> 01:17:36.135
How do you know you don't
like it unless you try it?

01:17:36.136 --> 01:17:38.513
A lot of things I
haven't tried, mate.

01:17:38.514 --> 01:17:42.517
I haven't tried incest, but I'm
pretty sure I wouldn't like it.

01:17:42.518 --> 01:17:46.768
Incest and salsa are two very
different things, trust me.

01:17:51.151 --> 01:17:55.446
Bruce, call me when you get this.
I want to know you're all right.

01:17:58.742 --> 01:18:01.786
- He's not picking up.
- He's probably crying somewhere.

01:18:01.787 --> 01:18:05.958
Somewhere quiet and dry.
That's what I would be doing.

01:18:06.667 --> 01:18:08.619
I think I know where he is.

01:18:16.468 --> 01:18:18.966
- Can I borrow a racket?
- Help yourself.

01:18:28.981 --> 01:18:31.316
So how did it go?

01:18:31.317 --> 01:18:35.028
I'm wearing a silk shirt studded
with jet-black rhinestones

01:18:35.029 --> 01:18:37.614
driving balls out
into the darkness.

01:18:37.615 --> 01:18:39.532
How do you think it went?

01:18:39.533 --> 01:18:41.906
So now what? Are you
going to stop dancing?

01:18:42.703 --> 01:18:45.247
- I was only doing it for her.
- Were you?

01:18:47.875 --> 01:18:50.126
So, what, are you going
to give it all up again,

01:18:50.127 --> 01:18:51.919
the only thing you're good at?

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.671
Literally the only thing
you've ever been good at

01:18:53.672 --> 01:18:55.340
that wasn't shit and
totally pointless.

01:18:55.341 --> 01:18:57.300
Oh, OK, fine. Here we go.

01:18:57.301 --> 01:19:01.971
Just off the top of my head,
quizzes, carving Sunday roasts,

01:19:01.972 --> 01:19:04.641
the Rubik's Cube,
the Rubik's Sphere.

01:19:04.642 --> 01:19:07.060
The Rubik's Snake,
flags of the world,

01:19:07.061 --> 01:19:10.021
driving abroad, famous dams,

01:19:10.022 --> 01:19:12.899
identifying dogs by their
silhouettes, you know?

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:16.653
- African money. I could go on.
- You're wasting your life.

01:19:16.654 --> 01:19:19.364
What do you know?
You are 35 years old.

01:19:19.365 --> 01:19:24.243
And you are working as a hula girl.
Oh, sorry, no, hula woman. Oh!

01:19:24.244 --> 01:19:26.538
- Fuck off, Bruce.
- You fuck off.

01:19:32.503 --> 01:19:34.671
- Good shot.
- Thanks.

01:19:35.839 --> 01:19:37.256
You need to dance, Bruce.

01:19:37.883 --> 01:19:41.219
You were lost. This is
your chance to get back.

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:43.514
- I don't have a partner.
- Yeah, you do.

01:19:45.474 --> 01:19:47.597
- You?
- I've still got it.

01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:52.518
- That's pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:53.524 --> 01:19:55.442
Remember the old routine?

01:19:57.695 --> 01:20:00.863
Don't. Don't do that.
Don't you bloody dare.

01:20:00.864 --> 01:20:03.066
Don't evoke it.

01:20:06.036 --> 01:20:12.460
Thunder, Thunder,
Thunder, ThunderCats! Ho!

01:20:38.777 --> 01:20:42.655
'Yes, please, give it
up for Gaz and Kate.'

01:20:45.743 --> 01:20:49.328
Salt and pepper, here
comes the hot stepper.

01:20:49.329 --> 01:20:51.497
- All right? All right, Gal?
- Oi, oi.

01:20:51.498 --> 01:20:55.293
- Hey, Helen, thanks for coming.
- Fuck me, you look great.

01:20:55.294 --> 01:20:58.998
- Where's Ron?
- He was busy. I'm sorry.

01:21:00.758 --> 01:21:02.759
Bruce, forget Ron.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.383
You look so good you could
be fucking Bee Gee.

01:21:06.096 --> 01:21:10.221
'Oye, look at this.
<i>Me la rebanco.</i>

01:21:10.768 --> 01:21:13.312
'Don't ruffle her feathers.'

01:21:16.482 --> 01:21:18.274
You have to go.

01:21:18.275 --> 01:21:21.854
'Just what I'm talking about.
Let's go through to the next round.

01:21:22.112 --> 01:21:27.033
<i>Celebremos. Celebremos. Celebremos.</i>

01:21:27.034 --> 01:21:31.287
'Can we please have the couples to
the dance floor for heat four?'

01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:34.207
- Are you ready?
- No.

01:21:34.208 --> 01:21:36.502
Me neither. Come on. Let's go.

01:21:37.169 --> 01:21:39.167
I'm sorry.

01:21:55.896 --> 01:21:58.523
Hey!

01:22:00.192 --> 01:22:01.859
- Happy?
- Yeah.

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:05.112
Big smile, tits and teeth out.

01:22:05.113 --> 01:22:06.864
'Let's go!'

01:22:10.869 --> 01:22:15.620
'That's what I'm talking about!'

01:22:16.834 --> 01:22:19.085
- Holy shit.
- Wow.

01:22:19.086 --> 01:22:21.755
Yes, holy shit.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.338
'Look at this. The feet of fury.'

01:22:26.426 --> 01:22:28.845
Hey, adios, my friends.

01:22:40.357 --> 01:22:42.480
Ho!

01:22:45.404 --> 01:22:47.948
I'm sorry. You have to go.

01:22:53.203 --> 01:22:55.155
Time to go.

01:22:55.873 --> 01:22:59.375
'Catch her. Have a ball.
In blue, <i>azul.</i>

01:22:59.376 --> 01:23:02.378
'We have our semi-finalists here.'

01:23:02.379 --> 01:23:05.082
'Amazing!

01:23:06.425 --> 01:23:08.343
'Inspirational!'

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.309
- OK, I want it back.
- What?

01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:18.102
- Come on. Where is it?
- Where's what?

01:23:18.103 --> 01:23:21.188
What have you done with it?
Where have you hidden it?

01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:22.815
- Is it in this pocket?
- Don't.

01:23:22.816 --> 01:23:24.609
- It's in this pocket.
- Don't muck about.

01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:26.812
- What have you done with it?
- What?

01:23:27.571 --> 01:23:30.990
You took my breath away in
there and I want it back.

01:23:30.991 --> 01:23:33.784
Ha-ha! Very funny.

01:23:33.785 --> 01:23:38.331
Bruce, when I first met you,
you were like a <i>sangeh ghohi</i>

01:23:38.332 --> 01:23:40.416
Mm, <i>sangeh ghohi</i>

01:23:40.417 --> 01:23:42.627
What does it mean, <i>sangeh ghohi?</i>

01:23:42.628 --> 01:23:46.339
It's like a large round
stone with some shit on it.

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:51.717
But now... you have
become of the age.

01:23:52.512 --> 01:23:54.714
You are a man, Bruce.

01:23:57.434 --> 01:23:59.268
Yeah.

01:23:59.269 --> 01:24:01.471
Yeah, I suppose I am.

01:24:02.981 --> 01:24:06.567
And now you have stolen my
heart as well as my breath.

01:24:06.568 --> 01:24:09.487
Where do you keep
hiding these things?

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.116
- I should get back out there.
- Yes. Yes, you should.

01:24:14.117 --> 01:24:19.080
You go, Bruce. Go and kill them
all, man, woman and child.

01:24:19.081 --> 01:24:21.874
I'm not going to kill a child.

01:24:21.875 --> 01:24:25.079
OK. Go!

01:24:32.177 --> 01:24:33.719
Do you have a Tic Tac?

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:38.016
'Musica, maestro!
What about these guys?

01:24:38.892 --> 01:24:41.018
'What about these guys?

01:24:41.019 --> 01:24:43.604
'Brrr!'

01:24:47.776 --> 01:24:49.978
'Hey, now.'

01:24:57.995 --> 01:24:59.572
Oh, no, no, no. Get off.

01:25:05.419 --> 01:25:07.496
- 'I'm sorry, friends.'
- Let's go.

01:25:10.507 --> 01:25:14.052
'Hey, you dig it!

01:25:15.846 --> 01:25:18.720
'And here is fanning
the flames of salsa.'

01:25:21.351 --> 01:25:23.553
- Ow!
- Let's go!

01:25:26.815 --> 01:25:28.267
Let's go!

01:25:32.446 --> 01:25:34.648
- Yes!
- Come on, Bruce!

01:25:41.121 --> 01:25:42.872
'Double pleasure.

01:25:42.873 --> 01:25:45.872
'Wow, that's unexpected.'

01:25:57.637 --> 01:26:00.010
You're in my yard now.

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:19.201
'We have our finalists!
We have our finalists.'

01:26:20.285 --> 01:26:22.828
Oh, love you, Bruce.

01:26:26.208 --> 01:26:28.911
Hey.

01:26:29.711 --> 01:26:32.838
- 'Let's hear it. Come on.'
- That's my best mate.

01:26:32.839 --> 01:26:34.256
'Wow.'

01:26:34.257 --> 01:26:37.635
- Gary, whisky, large.
- You can win this, Bruce.

01:26:37.636 --> 01:26:40.054
I haven't got much more left.

01:26:40.055 --> 01:26:42.599
- Drink it. Drink it.
- No, I don't want it.

01:26:43.475 --> 01:26:47.521
Eye of the tiger, Bruce.
Eye of the tiger!

01:26:47.979 --> 01:26:51.440
'Ladies and gentlemen,
the floor is yours.'

01:27:51.418 --> 01:27:52.665
Wow.

01:27:53.378 --> 01:27:56.047
Yeah, I thought I'd make an effort.

01:27:57.549 --> 01:28:00.050
Me and Drew wasn't anything.

01:28:00.051 --> 01:28:03.050
That's not anything.

01:28:05.265 --> 01:28:06.515
Good.

01:28:06.516 --> 01:28:10.596
I just wanted to say thank
you for the mix tape.

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:15.691
It's no big deal, although
the inlay, that took ages.

01:28:15.692 --> 01:28:18.402
Great inlay. Excellent penmanship.

01:28:18.403 --> 01:28:19.904
- Thank you.
- Really.

01:28:19.905 --> 01:28:22.072
Yeah, I used a very fine nib

01:28:22.073 --> 01:28:26.073
0.4 mil, it's tiny. It's probably
the width of a human hair.

01:28:26.494 --> 01:28:31.040
So I didn't have you down as
a salsa guy. No of fence.

01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:33.042
Right, yes.

01:28:33.043 --> 01:28:36.879
I was a dancer when I was
a kid and I loved it

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.927
and then this shit thing happened
to me and everything changed...

01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:46.263
until I met you and
you inspired me,

01:28:46.264 --> 01:28:48.891
so I learnt to dance again.

01:28:48.892 --> 01:28:50.768
I re-learnt all the old steps.

01:28:50.769 --> 01:28:53.896
I tracked down my old teacher,
Ron Parfitt who's just...

01:28:53.897 --> 01:28:56.232
He's a horrible,
horrible human being.

01:28:56.233 --> 01:28:59.109
I shaved my chest. I went
to some amazing clubs.

01:28:59.110 --> 01:29:02.238
I met some amazing
people and now...

01:29:02.239 --> 01:29:07.201
finally I feel like me again,
which is what I always wanted.

01:29:07.202 --> 01:29:10.155
You know? To... feel like myself.

01:29:13.124 --> 01:29:15.918
- You shaved your chest?
- Yeah, I shaved my chest, and...

01:29:15.919 --> 01:29:19.999
...it's very itchy, all the time.

01:29:21.675 --> 01:29:24.802
'OK, kill the musica,
please, maestro.

01:29:24.803 --> 01:29:30.100
'Ladies and gentlemen, let's
go, the Santo Vito final!'

01:29:37.399 --> 01:29:39.942
I was wondering
perhaps you would...

01:29:39.943 --> 01:29:41.736
Yes, I'll dance with you.

01:29:45.156 --> 01:29:47.199
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:29:47.951 --> 01:29:51.120
- Do you want me to lead?
- No, no, I'll be all right.

01:29:51.121 --> 01:29:53.497
I was actually doing quite
well until you turned up.

01:29:53.498 --> 01:29:55.120
Probably be disqualified.

01:29:59.713 --> 01:30:01.586
'Hey!

01:30:03.633 --> 01:30:06.382
'Yes, friends. <i>Oye, mi amigo.</i>

01:30:10.932 --> 01:30:13.100
'This is the final, friends.

01:30:13.101 --> 01:30:15.724
'Let them feel you.
Let them feel you.'

01:31:31.513 --> 01:31:35.638
'Santa Vito, our winners!'

01:31:38.937 --> 01:31:42.314
- I don't think we won.
- Maybe next time.

01:31:42.315 --> 01:31:45.442
Fab. That was amazing.

01:31:46.986 --> 01:31:49.071
- Hi, I'm Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

01:31:49.072 --> 01:31:51.616
<i>Scusi señor Garrett.</i>

01:31:52.409 --> 01:31:54.452
Permission to come on
to your dance floor.

01:31:56.162 --> 01:31:57.830
Granted, Mr Parfitt.

01:32:01.084 --> 01:32:03.537
- Mwah!
- Ah.

01:32:04.754 --> 01:32:08.424
'I don't know about you,
but it's time for some love.

01:32:08.425 --> 01:32:11.135
'So demonstrate.
Come on. Let's go.'

01:32:18.643 --> 01:32:20.891
Hey, good work.

01:32:22.647 --> 01:32:24.645
Well done.
