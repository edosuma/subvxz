WEBVTT

01:05.176 --> 01:08.879
After all these long years...

01:34.837 --> 01:36.905
how famished you must be.

01:40.878 --> 01:43.912
Oh, sweet Jezebel.

01:43.947 --> 01:46.014
Look!

01:46.049 --> 01:49.817
We're rich!

01:57.425 --> 01:58.726
Aah!

02:05.566 --> 02:08.935
The blood is the life.

03:15.032 --> 03:17.466
All the guests have arrived.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.968
Photographed upon entry?

03:19.002 --> 03:21.570
As arranged.

03:21.604 --> 03:24.272
And the prototype?
Ready for the demonstration

03:24.306 --> 03:25.540
as scheduled?

03:25.574 --> 03:27.142
It is, sir.

03:27.176 --> 03:29.610
As scheduled.

03:29.645 --> 03:34.515
From this day forward,
you are an American industrialist.

03:34.550 --> 03:40.520
As American as God, guns,
and bourbon...

03:40.555 --> 03:44.124
- As scheduled.
- Very good, sir.

03:47.996 --> 03:49.697
Good evening.

03:49.731 --> 03:52.032
I'm Alexander Grayson.

04:09.149 --> 04:12.751
It's breathtaking.

04:12.785 --> 04:14.786
Well, isn't this exciting?

04:14.821 --> 04:17.822
- I'm liking this Grayson already.
- Thank you.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.962
This glass is worth
more than I earn in a week.

04:23.996 --> 04:26.031
Don't be gauche, Jonathan.

04:26.065 --> 04:28.599
Besides...it's worth more than
you make in a month.

04:28.633 --> 04:30.034
Lucy!

04:30.068 --> 04:31.936
I'm only having a bit of fun.

04:31.970 --> 04:34.438
You're not cross with me, are you?
I'd be simply devastated.

04:34.472 --> 04:36.240
Of course not.
You're far too charming.

04:36.274 --> 04:38.976
I am, aren't I?

04:39.010 --> 04:40.377
I'm off.

04:40.411 --> 04:42.847
Now, you'll remember
your promise, won't you?

04:42.881 --> 04:46.550
I'm your guest tonight,
not a journalist.

04:46.584 --> 04:49.586
He's such a darling, isn't he?

04:49.621 --> 04:51.622
Alastair! You beast.

04:51.656 --> 04:53.223
Where have you been hiding?

04:53.258 --> 04:54.891
Lucy, darling.

04:54.925 --> 04:57.927
It's quite an eclectic group.

04:57.962 --> 05:00.363
New money, old money,
no money left.

05:00.397 --> 05:02.632
Which do you suppose
is Alexander Grayson?

05:02.666 --> 05:05.301
I'm sure he'll announce himself
to great fanfare.

05:05.335 --> 05:07.503
- They always do at these things.
- Hmm.

05:07.537 --> 05:10.373
How I ever let you talk me
into this...

05:10.407 --> 05:12.541
Seriously, somebody had
to pry you out of that laboratory.

05:12.576 --> 05:13.809
The truth.

05:13.843 --> 05:15.811
Who would you rather spend
your evening with me,

05:15.845 --> 05:17.479
or a pickled toad?

05:17.513 --> 05:20.448
Um, the toad...

05:20.483 --> 05:22.417
Because at least there's a chance

05:22.451 --> 05:24.719
my kiss might turn him into a prince.

05:27.423 --> 05:31.192
Well, hasn't he tried hard?

05:31.226 --> 05:33.661
Might as well have papered
the walls with pound notes.

05:33.695 --> 05:36.463
How distressingly American.

05:36.498 --> 05:38.899
Frankly, I'm amazed
so many of us turned up at all.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.967
How can we properly mock him

05:41.002 --> 05:43.003
if we haven't set eyes on the man?

05:50.043 --> 05:54.046
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure to introduce

05:54.080 --> 05:57.517
the master of Carfax Manor,
your host,

05:57.551 --> 05:59.585
Mister Alexander Grayson!

06:04.424 --> 06:06.491
- It's him.
- It's him!

06:30.115 --> 06:32.483
Welcome to my house.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.820
May you come freely, go safely,

06:35.854 --> 06:40.457
and please, leave some
of the happiness you bring.

06:44.495 --> 06:45.762
Is everything all right?

06:45.796 --> 06:47.697
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

06:47.732 --> 06:48.832
Yes.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.834
Someone walked over my grave,
I suppose.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.868
Hmm.

06:56.806 --> 06:59.107
That woman.
Blue satin, creme chiffon.

06:59.141 --> 07:00.942
I want to know everything about her,

07:00.977 --> 07:03.579
- and the man she's with.
- Of course, sir.

07:15.191 --> 07:18.058
Ah, the mysterious Mister Grayson.
Finally we meet.

07:18.093 --> 07:19.794
And you would be?

07:19.828 --> 07:21.061
Well, I would be in a nice warm bath,

07:21.096 --> 07:25.632
but I simply had to come and find out
what all the fuss was about.

07:25.666 --> 07:28.568
- Jayne Wetherby.
- Hmm.

07:28.603 --> 07:29.603
Lord Wetherby?

07:29.637 --> 07:31.505
Oh, good God, no!

07:31.539 --> 07:34.240
This is my, um,
companion for the night,

07:34.275 --> 07:36.910
my very dear friend, Herr Kruger.

07:38.350 --> 07:39.684
Gesundheit.

07:43.592 --> 07:52.064
Huh.

08:11.581 --> 08:13.382
Ah. Sir Clive Dawes.

08:14.025 --> 08:16.360
Alexander Grayson.

08:17.358 --> 08:19.526
Permit me to introduce my wife,
Lady Hope.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.994
What an impressive ballroom,
Mister Grayson.

08:22.029 --> 08:24.931
May I present Lord Davenport...

08:24.965 --> 08:28.167
And Lady Laurent...

08:28.201 --> 08:29.402
And Lord Laurent.

08:29.436 --> 08:31.070
Lord Laurent.

08:31.104 --> 08:33.705
Splendid.
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

08:33.740 --> 08:36.976
you and Sir Clive co-chair the board
of British Imperial Coolant Company.

08:37.010 --> 08:39.410
We sit on a number of boards,
Mister Grayson.

08:39.445 --> 08:41.446
Indeed you do.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.181
British Imperial holds patents,

08:43.215 --> 08:44.950
patents to high-efficiency coolants

08:44.984 --> 08:48.152
which would be most useful
in advancing one of

08:48.186 --> 08:49.887
my technological projects.

08:49.922 --> 08:52.590
I would very much like
to acquire those patents.

08:52.624 --> 08:54.892
Mister Grayson,
the British Imperial Company

08:54.927 --> 08:57.795
is in the business of selling
our products to British industry,

08:57.830 --> 09:02.533
not our underlying patents
to interloping colonials.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.104
Darling.

09:17.182 --> 09:21.650
Perhaps next time you'll sway Sir Clive
through his bookmakers.

09:21.685 --> 09:24.386
He's an inveterate gambler,
not a terribly good one

09:24.420 --> 09:26.054
from what I gather.

09:26.089 --> 09:28.724
Jonathan! Where did you run...

09:30.226 --> 09:33.328
- Alexander Grayson.
- Jonathan Harker.

09:33.363 --> 09:36.531
And this is my most lovely friend,
Miss Mina Murray.

09:36.565 --> 09:39.467
Of course. Mina.

09:42.070 --> 09:43.404
I'm sorry, it's just...

09:43.438 --> 09:45.974
- I'd swear...
- We've met?

09:46.008 --> 09:48.242
Yes.

09:48.276 --> 09:51.645
- I was thinking the same thing.
- Pardon me, sir.

09:51.679 --> 09:54.481
- It's time.
- Ah, yes.

09:54.516 --> 09:57.117
Excuse me.

09:58.820 --> 10:01.788
Tell me, Renfield.
Who is this Jonathan Harker?

10:01.823 --> 10:03.557
He's a reporter for the Inquisitor.

10:03.591 --> 10:06.426
Resourceful, tenacious,
and very, very ambitious.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.861
Hmm. And the woman?

10:08.896 --> 10:10.963
Mina Murray, medical student.

10:10.998 --> 10:12.798
Father, Doctor William Murray,

10:12.833 --> 10:14.834
director of Bethlem Royal Hospital.

10:33.516 --> 10:35.250
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:35.285 --> 10:39.088
please, gather in
the center of the ballroom.

10:41.390 --> 10:44.058
Mister Harker. Arem Renfield.

10:44.093 --> 10:47.428
You're aware that the invitation
explicitly forbade the press?

10:47.463 --> 10:50.030
I can assure you,
I'm purely here on a social basis.

10:50.065 --> 10:51.499
What a shame.

10:51.533 --> 10:53.000
Mister Grayson will be disappointed

10:53.034 --> 10:55.470
that you won't be writing
at least a word or two.

10:55.504 --> 10:58.238
If you're interested,
he would like you

10:58.272 --> 11:00.674
to come by tomorrow
for an interview.

11:02.543 --> 11:06.045
An... An interview?

11:06.080 --> 11:08.181
Of course, I'd be interested.

11:08.216 --> 11:10.950
4:30, then.

11:20.293 --> 11:23.362
And now, Mister Grayson
would like to share

11:23.396 --> 11:27.766
a demonstration of his latest
technical marvel!

11:29.435 --> 11:32.104
Honored guests...

11:32.138 --> 11:33.538
When I was a boy,

11:33.572 --> 11:36.775
my father told me stories of
the dark ages,

11:36.809 --> 11:41.013
a time when culture and learning
were eclipsed

11:41.047 --> 11:45.983
by barbaric ritual and war.

11:46.018 --> 11:48.019
Over the years,
I have come to believe that

11:48.053 --> 11:53.624
the dark ages never actually ended,
that the fear...

11:53.659 --> 11:56.560
hatred, and brutality

11:56.594 --> 11:59.897
that once plagued our ancestors

11:59.931 --> 12:03.166
plagues us still.

12:03.200 --> 12:09.172
Tonight, it is my sublime pleasure

12:09.206 --> 12:12.742
to demonstrate a way out.

12:12.777 --> 12:16.179
Out of the darkness.

12:18.748 --> 12:23.018
What Thomas Edison dismissed
as mere fantasy,

12:23.053 --> 12:26.755
what Nikola Tesla failed
to bring to fruition,

12:26.790 --> 12:28.691
I give to you tonight.

12:28.725 --> 12:32.627
Power drawn from the magnetosphere,

12:32.662 --> 12:34.662
the same invisible source

12:34.697 --> 12:40.367
that compels the needle on
this compass to point North.

12:40.402 --> 12:45.573
Harnessed and amplified by
my scientists and technicians,

12:45.607 --> 12:49.442
I give to you free...

12:49.476 --> 12:55.448
safe, wireless power.

12:55.482 --> 12:58.318
Now. Stage one.

12:58.352 --> 13:00.658
Stand by!

13:08.428 --> 13:10.896
Stage one!

13:10.931 --> 13:13.866
Mark!

13:13.900 --> 13:16.869
- Is such a thing possible?
- In theory, I suppose.

13:16.903 --> 13:18.137
But if it were brought to the market,

13:18.171 --> 13:20.106
what effect would it have on
our petroleum interests?

13:20.140 --> 13:23.441
- Shattering, of course.
- Nothing we need worry about.

13:30.650 --> 13:31.916
More power.

13:32.352 --> 13:33.385
More power.

13:33.419 --> 13:35.887
Stage two!

13:35.921 --> 13:37.921
Mark!

13:46.732 --> 13:48.065
Lucy.

13:48.099 --> 13:50.368
Lucy, look.

13:50.385 --> 13:53.575
Some sort of trick.
There must be a wire.

14:27.009 --> 14:30.864
Sync and corrected by Elderfel</font>
www.addic7ed.com

14:35.663 --> 14:38.931
- Ah, shut that down, now!
- Aah!

14:40.567 --> 14:43.869
Experiencing some
technical difficulties, sir.

14:43.903 --> 14:46.672
Just a few more seconds.

14:51.110 --> 14:53.378
Somebody help us!

14:53.412 --> 14:55.646
I'm burning! I'm burning!

14:55.681 --> 14:58.816
The coolant has evaporated!

14:58.850 --> 15:02.653
I'm shutting down!

15:10.528 --> 15:14.831
- It's a trick.
- It's a trick.

15:14.865 --> 15:17.067
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:17.101 --> 15:20.336
I thank you for your patience.

15:20.370 --> 15:24.474
I trust our little demonstration was...

15:24.508 --> 15:25.575
illuminating.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.285
Lucy Westenra.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.288
Miss Westenra.

15:40.323 --> 15:42.691
Ravishing.

15:42.726 --> 15:44.959
Miss Murray,
you look a little shaken.

15:44.994 --> 15:47.194
I'm not sure what I've just witnessed.

15:47.229 --> 15:49.631
The future, Miss Murray.

15:49.665 --> 15:52.734
The beginning of a new era.

15:52.768 --> 15:54.301
Mister Harker.

15:54.336 --> 15:55.937
- Tomorrow, then.
- Yes.

15:55.971 --> 15:59.373
Yes, of course.

16:02.576 --> 16:04.778
He seems quite taken with you.

16:04.812 --> 16:06.146
Ooh.

16:06.180 --> 16:08.048
The green-eyed monster
rears his ugly head.

16:08.082 --> 16:09.883
Mister Grayson is just being polite.

16:09.917 --> 16:12.052
More than polite, I'd say.

16:12.086 --> 16:14.087
Ooh! Cordials.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.501
That was extraordinary.

16:29.536 --> 16:32.671
Lady Jayne.

16:32.705 --> 16:34.238
I didn't hear you approaching.

16:34.273 --> 16:37.008
You say that as if it's an accomplishment,
Mr. Grayson.

16:37.043 --> 16:39.044
Alexander, please.

16:40.279 --> 16:43.581
You know, there's a touch of
the impresario about you, Alexander.

16:43.615 --> 16:48.686
Your performance this evening
was no less than operatic.

16:48.720 --> 16:52.389
As I'm an ardent patron of the opera,
I'll take that as a compliment,

16:52.423 --> 16:55.025
although I'm certain it was
meant as quite the opposite.

16:55.060 --> 16:56.827
Oh, you are?

16:56.861 --> 16:59.029
So you love the opera?
Well, may I be the first

16:59.064 --> 17:01.631
to invite you to
the opening of the season?

17:03.301 --> 17:05.801
Tell me, Alexander,

17:05.836 --> 17:07.837
will you join me?

17:07.871 --> 17:11.240
- I've reserved my own box.
- Pity.

17:11.273 --> 17:15.243
I feel you'd enjoy the performance
so much more in mine.

17:15.278 --> 17:16.779
No doubt.

17:16.814 --> 17:18.815
Hmm.

17:23.886 --> 17:27.454
Thank you for coming.

17:27.489 --> 17:30.125
May I?

17:30.159 --> 17:33.461
- Mister Grayson.
- Ah.

17:33.495 --> 17:35.330
If you think you fooled anyone

17:35.364 --> 17:39.466
with that absurd stunt tonight,
you are sadly mistaken.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.701
Am I?

17:40.736 --> 17:42.669
You are a fraud, sir.

17:42.704 --> 17:46.406
And I will see to it
that you never do business here.

18:05.893 --> 18:07.893
She's not going to wait forever.

18:11.497 --> 18:13.732
If you don't ask her
to marry you soon,

18:13.767 --> 18:15.567
someone else is bound to.

18:15.601 --> 18:17.402
- Who?
- Grayson?

18:17.436 --> 18:18.837
Don't be absurd.

18:18.872 --> 18:20.605
You must've noticed the way
he leered at you.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.274
He did not.

18:22.308 --> 18:23.675
At least he's not boring.

18:23.709 --> 18:25.609
As much as I enjoy having you
spend the night at my house,

18:25.644 --> 18:29.413
could we please, for once,
talk about something other than

18:29.447 --> 18:31.082
how tedious you find Jonathan?

18:31.116 --> 18:33.684
And besides, he's not boring.

18:33.718 --> 18:37.922
What I'm saying is that
she could do better.

18:54.805 --> 18:57.173
Do you see anything?

18:57.207 --> 18:58.608
No.

18:58.642 --> 19:00.710
What do you suppose it is?

19:09.786 --> 19:12.153
- Good night, Mr. Clive.
- Good night.

19:12.188 --> 19:15.290
Horse, move on.

19:26.635 --> 19:30.003
Aah!

19:30.939 --> 19:32.840
The man was a pig.

19:32.874 --> 19:34.341
He insulted me under my own roof.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.576
So you tear the man to pieces?

19:36.610 --> 19:38.678
Perhaps we should mount
a warning sign

19:38.713 --> 19:40.146
over the front door.

19:40.180 --> 19:43.683
I told you, their corruption
and their hubris is unbridled.

19:43.718 --> 19:45.652
That's always been the way
with the Order of the Dragon.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.086
Still, it's one thing to hear it,

19:47.120 --> 19:49.756
quite another to see it
with one's own eyes.

19:49.790 --> 19:51.257
Readily identified by

19:51.291 --> 19:54.327
their overtly grotesque sense
of entitlement.

19:55.329 --> 19:57.796
Like this one, Lord Laurent.

19:57.831 --> 19:59.431
Preening little peacock.

19:59.466 --> 20:02.134
And the other one,
Lord what's-his-name?

20:02.169 --> 20:04.570
- Davenport.
- Davenport.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.272
These two stink of high council.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.640
Put them on the short list.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.676
Who do you suppose is the leader?

20:11.710 --> 20:14.913
Could be any one of these.
Or none.

20:14.947 --> 20:18.283
- How very innocuous.
- But you cross them, Renfield,

20:18.317 --> 20:22.187
and they will strike you down
like vipers in a pit.

20:22.221 --> 20:26.957
Murder, torture, rape,
wholesale slaughter.

20:26.992 --> 20:31.962
That is the stock-in-trade
of the Order of the Dragon,

20:31.997 --> 20:34.899
and has been for over 500 years.

20:34.933 --> 20:37.001
In my past,

20:37.035 --> 20:39.835
they asserted their will more directly

20:39.870 --> 20:44.073
via the cross and the sword,

20:44.108 --> 20:46.009
slaughtering entire villages,

20:46.043 --> 20:48.111
branding men and women heretics.

20:48.145 --> 20:49.445
Aah!

20:49.479 --> 20:51.647
Burning them alive,

20:51.681 --> 20:55.150
and watching them burn, screaming...

20:56.986 --> 20:58.620
For a God who never came.

20:58.654 --> 21:01.256
Now they do their dirty work

21:01.291 --> 21:03.025
via private clubs and boardrooms.

21:03.059 --> 21:07.862
They employ business, politics,
and oil.

21:07.897 --> 21:11.765
And that last thing, Renfield,
will be their undoing.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.468
They believe it will fuel
the next century.

21:14.502 --> 21:18.705
And if they control it,
they control the future.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.607
But from the moment we demonstrate

21:20.642 --> 21:24.111
the viability of geomagnetic technology...

21:24.146 --> 21:26.247
Poof!

21:26.281 --> 21:29.249
No more money.

21:29.283 --> 21:30.523
No more power.

21:30.558 --> 21:32.836
No more Order of the Dragon.

24:02.833 --> 24:05.477
He performed a full examination?

24:05.512 --> 24:06.519
As instructed.

24:06.554 --> 24:08.454
Any signs of vampiric feeding?

24:08.489 --> 24:11.191
Too much damage to the neck
to make a positive determination.

24:11.225 --> 24:12.458
So he severs the man's head

24:12.493 --> 24:14.561
and dresses him up
like a roasted French hen.

24:14.595 --> 24:17.664
Well, it had to be done.
You know why.

24:19.966 --> 24:21.967
How long has it been since
a vampire stalked

24:22.002 --> 24:24.836
the streets of this city?
Seven years?

24:24.870 --> 24:26.438
Eight years.

24:26.472 --> 24:30.509
Yes, the Whitechapel killings.

24:30.543 --> 24:33.679
God, when I think of
the trouble we went to,

24:33.713 --> 24:35.847
mutilating the victims
to hide the signs,

24:35.881 --> 24:38.316
those absurd letters
we wrote to the press.

24:38.350 --> 24:41.352
Huh. Jack the Ripper, indeed.

24:43.589 --> 24:45.356
What do you suggest?

24:45.390 --> 24:46.957
Well, unless proven otherwise,

24:46.991 --> 24:51.462
I think we must assume that Clive
was targeted by our enemies,

24:51.496 --> 24:53.797
whether natural or not.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.267
I will put Kruger on patrol.

24:57.301 --> 25:00.303
Have him keep an eye on the
high council members' houses.

25:00.338 --> 25:02.305
- Indefinitely?
- No.

25:02.340 --> 25:06.676
Just until time or events
proves us overcautious.

25:06.711 --> 25:07.877
You won't even know he's there.

25:07.911 --> 25:09.312
See to it that we don't.

25:09.347 --> 25:11.079
This is strictly between you
and me for now.

25:11.114 --> 25:12.881
We don't want to make the others
any more nervous

25:12.915 --> 25:15.817
- than they already are.
- Hmm.

25:15.852 --> 25:16.918
And if anyone asks...

25:16.953 --> 25:19.388
He was killed by a dog.

25:19.422 --> 25:20.656
Good girl.

25:20.690 --> 25:22.691
And take that bloody thing with you.

25:31.533 --> 25:34.802
The structure of the neuron
is absolutely distinct

25:34.836 --> 25:37.788
from all other cells in the human body.

25:40.108 --> 25:42.109
- Mister Campbell?
- Um...

25:44.111 --> 25:46.413
Sorry, sir. We weren't, um...

25:46.447 --> 25:49.449
- Professor Van Helsing?
- Yes, Miss Murray?

25:49.484 --> 25:51.485
Mister Campbell was only
pointing out to his colleagues

25:51.519 --> 25:55.221
how analogous certain aspects of
the front-page article regarding

25:55.256 --> 25:57.957
the generation of electrical impulses

25:57.992 --> 26:00.593
are to the subject
of your lecture today.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.628
Mister Campbell?

26:10.671 --> 26:12.204
Quite right, Mister Campbell.

26:12.238 --> 26:16.474
Mister Grayson's new technology
is germane to the subject at hand.

26:16.509 --> 26:18.710
However, I would suggest

26:18.744 --> 26:22.947
that you discuss such observations
outside of class.

26:36.894 --> 26:39.296
Mister Grayson will be right with you.

26:55.746 --> 26:58.214
Mister Harker.

26:58.248 --> 27:01.584
How good of you to come.

27:08.190 --> 27:10.992
Please, have a seat.

27:11.026 --> 27:12.293
Would you like some wine?

27:12.328 --> 27:15.063
It's a, um, bit early for me,
thank you.

27:21.035 --> 27:23.084
I prefer whiskey.

27:24.939 --> 27:28.775
You should know my editor believes
you're after some sort of puffery.

27:29.845 --> 27:32.613
- Puffery?
- Yes.

27:32.647 --> 27:35.181
And why would he think that?

27:36.450 --> 27:39.819
I don't field many interview requests
from those in your position.

27:39.854 --> 27:43.122
- You mean the wealthy?
- No, I mean the privileged.

27:43.156 --> 27:45.358
Usually, they run the other way.

27:45.393 --> 27:46.760
That's because
you stand against the same

27:46.794 --> 27:49.295
vested interests that would
prefer I return to America.

27:49.329 --> 27:51.029
I didn't think anyone had noticed.

27:51.063 --> 27:53.331
I did.

27:53.366 --> 27:57.936
That's precisely why I invited you
for this interview.

27:57.970 --> 27:59.872
Shall we begin?

27:59.906 --> 28:02.775
Very well.

28:02.809 --> 28:04.142
Why England?

28:04.176 --> 28:07.311
This is the country of
my great-grandparents' birth.

28:07.345 --> 28:08.913
In that regard, it's a homecoming.

28:08.947 --> 28:12.650
And it has nothing to do with Edison
running you out of the States?

28:12.684 --> 28:13.918
Hmm.

28:13.952 --> 28:18.656
Europe speaks to me
in a way no other place does.

28:18.690 --> 28:21.258
You know, we call it
"The Old World" for a reason.

28:21.293 --> 28:24.428
And yet, her people seek the new
wherever they can.

28:24.462 --> 28:26.563
I understand this struggle.

28:26.597 --> 28:31.100
I, myself, am descended from
a very old family.

28:31.135 --> 28:35.071
But my mind,
always fixed on the future.

28:35.105 --> 28:38.141
I surround myself with things
that speak to both.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.742
You're full of contradictions,
aren't you?

28:39.776 --> 28:42.277
- So is the world.
- Hmm.

28:42.312 --> 28:45.448
That is precisely why I wanted
to talk to you.

28:45.482 --> 28:48.250
You see, we're on the precipice
of a great change.

28:48.284 --> 28:53.388
We have it within ourselves
to redefine our species.

28:53.423 --> 28:56.991
Wait, you... You say "species"
as though people are animals.

28:57.025 --> 28:58.092
What do you mean by that?

28:58.126 --> 29:01.596
Is that not what Mister Darwin
taught us?

29:01.630 --> 29:04.298
That man evolves?

29:04.333 --> 29:06.233
That is what I've come here
to accomplish.

29:06.268 --> 29:09.537
To facilitate in that evolution.

29:11.067 --> 29:14.478
Give nature a helping hand,
so to speak.

29:22.712 --> 29:25.041
- Miss Murray.
- Professor.

29:25.076 --> 29:26.772
Come in. Have a seat.

29:34.875 --> 29:35.892
What is it?

29:35.927 --> 29:41.158
Well, um, we will soon be undergoing
our final examination.

29:41.192 --> 29:42.525
- Yes.
- And as you know,

29:42.560 --> 29:44.761
the student who scores
the highest will be given

29:44.796 --> 29:46.629
the opportunity to serve
as your research assistant.

29:46.664 --> 29:50.100
I see.

29:50.134 --> 29:53.403
You have consistently scored
the highest marks in class

29:53.437 --> 29:55.504
for every written and oral exam.

29:55.538 --> 29:58.273
- However...
- My surgical technique...

29:58.308 --> 30:00.375
...leaves much to be desired, yes.

30:00.410 --> 30:03.478
Professor, I can't tell you
how often I practice,

30:03.513 --> 30:06.982
but the moment the scalpel
pierces the epidermis,

30:07.017 --> 30:08.617
well...

30:08.651 --> 30:11.086
my hands begin to tremble
and no matter what I do, they...

30:11.120 --> 30:12.653
Mina...

30:12.688 --> 30:14.956
I have always found that

30:14.990 --> 30:18.426
the secret to a steady hand
is a steady heart.

30:18.460 --> 30:22.097
- I-I don't understand.
- You must believe in yourself,

30:22.131 --> 30:24.432
in your abilities to heal others.

30:24.466 --> 30:25.967
It is that simple.

30:26.001 --> 30:27.400
But I do.

30:27.435 --> 30:31.171
If so, then you will succeed.

30:31.206 --> 30:33.707
Until then, know this...

30:33.742 --> 30:36.076
The heart never lies.

30:40.715 --> 30:41.815
Thank you.

30:41.850 --> 30:43.682
Yes, well, I-I agree.

30:43.717 --> 30:47.620
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

30:52.859 --> 30:54.025
Good night.

31:32.497 --> 31:34.197
Hello.

31:34.231 --> 31:35.766
Sorry to have kept you waiting here.

32:02.358 --> 32:05.427
Aah!

32:10.298 --> 32:14.201
It was very generous of Mister Grayson
to give you his box tonight.

32:14.235 --> 32:15.436
Well, he obviously wants me

32:15.470 --> 32:17.638
to write nice things about him,
doesn't he?

32:17.672 --> 32:19.172
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

32:19.207 --> 32:21.442
A man such as Grayson is
so desperate

32:21.476 --> 32:23.243
to court favor with you?

32:23.277 --> 32:25.712
You'd think he'd be satisfied
with his beautiful home

32:25.746 --> 32:28.948
and all those brilliant paintings
and the thrilling technology,

32:28.982 --> 32:32.151
not to mention his good looks
and charisma.

32:32.185 --> 32:33.820
Hmm.

32:33.854 --> 32:36.422
Yes, it's very impressive.

32:36.457 --> 32:40.326
But then you have something
that he will never have.

32:40.361 --> 32:42.193
What's that?

32:42.228 --> 32:44.229
Me.

33:54.063 --> 33:56.531
The view is much better
from back here.

33:56.565 --> 33:59.401
Is it?
I can't imagine that's possible.

34:08.109 --> 34:11.745
Why don't you join me and see?

34:27.027 --> 34:30.429
Why, yes, it is.
It is astonishing.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.533
I trust you were unobserved?

34:35.568 --> 34:38.837
Your invitation did request
my "discreet company."

34:38.871 --> 34:40.772
Yes, it did.
Though I was concerned,

34:40.806 --> 34:42.574
as an American,
that you might not understand

34:42.608 --> 34:44.842
the meaning of the word "discreet."

34:44.877 --> 34:47.112
I had to look it up.

34:47.146 --> 34:51.148
Tell me, what other words
did you have to look up?

34:57.622 --> 35:00.992
Insatiable.

35:12.436 --> 35:14.804
Incorrigible.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.321
Unquenchable.

35:48.196 --> 35:50.410
Sir Clive not a day in the ground,

35:50.445 --> 35:52.828
and Grayson descends on
his widow like a bird of prey.

35:52.829 --> 35:55.829
Locked up Clive's entire block
of imperial coolant.

35:55.865 --> 35:57.632
Why on earth
would she sell out to him?

35:57.666 --> 35:59.868
He purchased the paper
on Clive's gambling debts,

35:59.902 --> 36:01.236
and threatened to sue his estate.

36:01.270 --> 36:03.038
- Good God!
- So you see, she had no choice

36:03.072 --> 36:06.107
but to trade the stock in order
to avert a scandal.

36:06.142 --> 36:08.876
Absolutely loathsome,
the whole damned business.

36:08.910 --> 36:10.244
Hmm.

36:10.278 --> 36:11.846
But you must admit, well played.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.914
That's easy for you to say.

36:13.949 --> 36:15.615
He's not your business partner.

36:15.650 --> 36:16.783
Oh, he's hardly that, old man.

36:16.818 --> 36:18.319
It's just a seat on the board.

36:18.353 --> 36:20.354
Not as if he has a controlling interest.

36:47.379 --> 36:48.779
Kruger.

36:48.813 --> 36:51.148
Ah.

36:58.723 --> 37:00.758
Ah!

37:12.736 --> 37:14.737
Oh!

37:17.875 --> 37:20.642
- Burn in hell!
- Aah!

37:28.785 --> 37:30.752
"Thou died fair and well,
brother huntsman killed."

37:31.988 --> 37:34.656
"Impaled the hearts of many beasts,

37:34.690 --> 37:36.690
before thine own was stilled."

37:40.495 --> 37:44.198
Before you die,

37:44.233 --> 37:45.934
take heart.

37:45.968 --> 37:48.602
You will soon be joined in hell...

37:48.637 --> 37:51.738
by scores of your brethren.

37:51.772 --> 37:54.074
I will destroy your Order...

37:54.108 --> 37:55.775
and everything it stands for.

37:55.810 --> 37:58.278
You are...

37:58.313 --> 38:00.314
Dracula.

38:24.703 --> 38:27.505
Ah!

38:34.680 --> 38:37.983
Practice all you want.
It won't save you.

38:38.017 --> 38:41.185
It speaks.

38:41.219 --> 38:42.987
Save me from what?

38:43.021 --> 38:44.888
The one that drew you to London?

38:44.922 --> 38:46.924
No one drew me.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.860
You're nothing.

38:49.894 --> 38:54.664
An errant fly attracted by
the stench of rot.

38:54.699 --> 38:58.167
Tell me your sire's name!

39:00.904 --> 39:02.071
You know,
there's fates for your kind

39:02.106 --> 39:05.708
a lot worse than death,
and I know them all.

39:05.742 --> 39:08.244
How long do you think it's going
to take for this to rust

39:08.278 --> 39:11.146
at the bottom of a lake?
Years? Decades?

39:11.180 --> 39:12.714
Do what you will to me.

39:12.748 --> 39:14.249
There will be another who follows,

39:14.283 --> 39:17.185
and another, and another,
and soon...

39:17.220 --> 39:19.821
Soon?

39:19.855 --> 39:22.690
We will be legion.

39:49.083 --> 39:51.851
I was wondering when
you'd make your entrance.

39:58.959 --> 40:01.626
The plan was to leverage
Sir Clive's gambling debts

40:01.661 --> 40:05.130
against his interests,
not his widow's.

40:05.165 --> 40:07.499
I saw an opportunity...

40:07.534 --> 40:08.733
and I seized it.

40:08.768 --> 40:11.536
It was impetuous and careless.

40:13.073 --> 40:14.206
It got the job done.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.407
How many times must
I explain the difference

40:16.442 --> 40:18.609
between a vendetta
and vengeance?

40:18.643 --> 40:20.978
This cannot become a war of attrition.

40:21.012 --> 40:24.549
The Order Draco is like the Hydra.

40:24.583 --> 40:27.318
Cut off a head,
they grow two to replace it.

40:27.352 --> 40:29.087
Funny.

40:29.121 --> 40:30.754
That's not what happened
to Sir Clive's head.

40:30.789 --> 40:32.055
Don't be a fool.

40:32.090 --> 40:35.725
You know the only way
to crush them is to wipe out

40:35.759 --> 40:38.395
the very source of their power,
their vast wealth.

40:38.429 --> 40:44.401
For over a decade we've schemed
and built this empire of lies.

40:44.435 --> 40:49.238
I will not have our work undone
by your lack of discipline!

40:49.272 --> 40:50.339
Ah!

40:54.711 --> 40:58.347
Give me one good reason
I should not peel you like a grape.

41:00.183 --> 41:05.520
Because without me, you'd still
be rotting in that iron box.

41:22.237 --> 41:25.506
Do you think
I am not immune to rage?

41:33.281 --> 41:38.151
The Order of the Dragon
slaughtered my entire family!

41:38.185 --> 41:42.421
We must not give in
to our base instincts.

41:42.456 --> 41:44.557
We must practice control.

41:44.591 --> 41:48.227
- We must follow the plan!
- True.

41:49.596 --> 41:52.964
Our hatred was born in the same crucible.

41:52.998 --> 41:54.999
You give it form.

41:55.034 --> 41:57.969
But I give it strength!

41:59.938 --> 42:02.874
We are not bound
by what we have lost,

42:02.908 --> 42:04.008
but by who took it!

42:04.043 --> 42:05.843
No!

42:05.878 --> 42:07.645
They killed my wife!

42:07.679 --> 42:09.280
My love.

42:09.314 --> 42:13.651
For these crimes,
I will have my vengeance.
