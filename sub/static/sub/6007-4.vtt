00:08.079 --> 00:10.280
<i>Dangerous advancements forever</i>

00:10.315 --> 00:12.482
<i>alter the criminal landscape.</i>

00:12.517 --> 00:14.117
<i>Police are not prepared.</i>

00:15.720 --> 00:18.322
<i>Law enforcement combats</i>
<i>this corruption</i>

00:18.356 --> 00:21.858
<i>with a new line of defense.</i>

00:21.893 --> 00:24.461
<i>But not all are created equal.</i>

00:26.497 --> 00:28.465
RUDY:
<i>The idea behind the DRNs</i>

00:28.499 --> 00:30.367
<i>was to be as human as possible.</i>

00:30.401 --> 00:32.970
<i>They were based on a program</i>

<i>That's one of the crazy ones.</i>

It just keeps ringing.

00:54.592 --> 00:57.127
MAN 2:
Call him again.

00:59.931 --> 01:01.898
MAN:
He's still not picking up.

01:01.933 --> 01:04.101
MAN 2: He's supposed to be
waiting for our call.

01:04.135 --> 01:06.103
There's no reason
for him not to answer.

01:06.137 --> 01:07.638
MAN:
This is not like him.

01:07.672 --> 01:10.240

(indistinct chatter)

01:37.068 --> 01:39.269
John, let's get going.

01:39.304 --> 01:41.505
We should get back out there.

01:41.539 --> 01:44.775
Come on, man, you're gonna
hurt Nuri's feelings.

01:44.809 --> 01:46.710
He's not the one
being inconsiderate.

01:46.744 --> 01:48.979
- I already offered you one.
- I don't eat.

01:49.013 --> 01:51.214
Well, I do. You got a problem
with that, go wait in the car.

01:51.249 --> 01:53.350
Don't you know...
in Japan, it's rude to leave

01:53.384 --> 01:54.718
before finishing a meal.

01:54.752 --> 01:57.721
We'll leave when I finish
every single bite.

02:01.326 --> 02:04.027
(speaking Japanese)

02:09.533 --> 02:11.101
What did you just say to him?

02:11.135 --> 02:13.904
(speaking nese.

02:13.938 --> 02:15.238
(Nuri speaks Japanese)

02:15.273 --> 02:17.407
(laughs quietly)

02:17.442 --> 02:18.975
I like Nuri, he's funny.

02:19.010 --> 02:20.744
Yeah, I like him, too.
What did you say?

02:22.880 --> 02:24.848
Bon appÃ©tit.

02:29.921 --> 02:31.355
That's alive.

02:31.389 --> 02:34.057
You don't want
to hurt Nuri's feelings.

02:34.092 --> 02:37.160
(Nuri speaks Japanese)

02:40.565 --> 02:43.667
You're gonna pay for this.

02:56.481 --> 03:00.450
JOHN:
Oh... God... ugh!

03:20.671 --> 03:23.573
(phone line ringing)

03:23.608 --> 03:25.041
Hey.

03:25.076 --> 03:26.109
Are you on your way home?

03:26.144 --> 03:27.944
I am.

03:27.979 --> 03:29.379
I just, uh...

03:29.414 --> 03:31.014
I'm just stopping
at the grocery store

03:31.048 --> 03:32.716
to pick up some things.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.584
How was your day?

03:34.619 --> 03:36.286
Long.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.754
Carl called in sick

03:37.789 --> 03:39.623
so I had to take an extra shift.

03:39.657 --> 03:40.757
Again?

03:40.792 --> 03:42.459
I know, right?

03:46.497 --> 03:47.964
Kell, I got to go.

03:47.999 --> 03:49.766
Will I see you
before I leave in the morning?

03:49.801 --> 03:51.668
You bet.

03:51.702 --> 03:53.670
I love you.

03:53.704 --> 03:55.238
I love you, too.

03:55.273 --> 03:56.773
Good night.

04:04.148 --> 04:05.649
You ready?

04:05.683 --> 04:07.918
Yeah.
Just let me do the talking.

04:07.952 --> 04:10.032
We give them a sample,
prove that you're a good cook,

04:10.054 --> 04:11.421
and get out of there, okay?

04:17.829 --> 04:19.963
Weapons check.

04:26.103 --> 04:27.137
He's clean.

04:27.171 --> 04:28.772
MAN:
You're always late.

04:28.806 --> 04:31.241
Hey, you're the ones
with the need.

04:31.275 --> 04:32.642
This your cook?

04:32.677 --> 04:33.643
This is him.

04:33.678 --> 04:35.946
Yeah, where's The Bishop?

04:39.050 --> 04:40.083
Yeah.

04:40.117 --> 04:42.719
Frank's here with his cook.

04:46.424 --> 04:48.358
Your guy better be good.

04:48.392 --> 04:51.394
(door closes)

05:01.005 --> 05:04.007
Nice to finally meet y, shop.

05:04.041 --> 05:06.576
I hear you're a man of talent.

05:07.778 --> 05:09.579
The Fijians thought so.

05:09.614 --> 05:11.581
COOK:
I brought a sample.

05:19.724 --> 05:22.826
84% pure.

05:22.860 --> 05:25.362
Now does the finder's fee
seem fair?

05:25.396 --> 05:28.465
We're talking 600 liters
of raw product.

05:28.499 --> 05:32.435
I gonna need
to see him cook first.

05:46.284 --> 05:47.918
What the hell are you doing?!

05:47.952 --> 05:49.753
(grunting)

05:49.787 --> 05:51.307
Whatever you're thinking,
you're wrong!

05:52.290 --> 05:53.356
(groans)

05:53.391 --> 05:55.859
(device blipping)

05:55.893 --> 05:57.394
(rapid blipping)

05:57.428 --> 05:58.595
(groans)

06:01.999 --> 06:03.133
(groans)

06:08.105 --> 06:09.339
What the hell is that?

06:09.373 --> 06:10.974
A subcutaneous wire.

06:11.008 --> 06:12.475
He's a cop.

06:12.510 --> 06:13.743
Come on...

06:13.778 --> 06:15.145
Okay.

06:15.179 --> 06:17.213
I'm not here alone.

06:17.248 --> 06:18.915
Yeah, you are.
Oh, no, no...

06:18.950 --> 06:20.417
(gunshots)

06:23.387 --> 06:25.322
DISPATCHER:
<i>We have a 31. Double homicide.</i>

06:25.356 --> 06:27.591
<i>Officer down.</i>

06:27.625 --> 06:29.659
<i>South turn, pier 22.</i>

06:38.102 --> 06:39.502
PAUL: We got an
unmarked car here.

06:39.537 --> 06:41.504
Deceased officer's prints
are all over it.

06:42.707 --> 06:43.807
We found this.

06:43.841 --> 06:45.475
Benzupropine.

06:45.509 --> 06:47.611
It's made from an algae
that grows in the ocean.

06:47.645 --> 06:49.212
It was only discovered
three years ago.

06:49.246 --> 06:50.313
They call it The Bends.

06:50.348 --> 06:51.881
Just what the department needs...

06:51.916 --> 06:54.217
a corrupt cop with a trunk
full of drugs.

06:54.251 --> 06:55.151
JOHN:
Who was he?

06:55.186 --> 06:56.519
His name's Cooper.

06:56.554 --> 06:58.588
He's from the 25th division.

06:58.623 --> 07:00.457
You know him?

07:10.735 --> 07:13.003
He was a good cop.

07:13.037 --> 07:15.238
No way he's dirty.

07:15.272 --> 07:16.840
When was the last time
you saw him?

07:18.242 --> 07:20.210
Five or six years ago.

07:20.244 --> 07:22.212
A lot can change
in five years, John.

07:22.246 --> 07:23.313
Some things don't.

07:23.347 --> 07:25.181
He had drugs in his trunk.

07:25.216 --> 07:26.683
Do you want to read the initial
investigation report?

07:26.717 --> 07:28.218
I don't care what it says.

07:28.252 --> 07:32.288
He was not registered
on any undercover operation.

07:36.827 --> 07:40.196
Someone pulled
a subcutaneous wire.

07:40.231 --> 07:42.365
If he was dirty,

07:42.400 --> 07:44.367
how come he's wearing a wire?

08:04.644 --> 08:06.378
PAUL: You know who that is?

08:06.413 --> 08:08.047
That's Alexio Barros.

08:08.081 --> 08:10.783
He's the captain of 2-5
precinct, narcotics division.

08:10.817 --> 08:13.352
This is the part
where he tells Maldonado

08:13.386 --> 08:15.120
IA was already investigating
Officer Cooper

08:15.155 --> 08:16.355
for dealing on the side.

08:16.389 --> 08:17.623
Save it, Paul.

08:17.657 --> 08:18.891
If he was such a saint,
why'd he have

08:18.925 --> 08:20.392
15 liters of The Bends
in his trunk?

08:20.427 --> 08:22.067
If he's guilty,
why he was wearing a wire?

08:22.095 --> 08:23.229
Well, one theory's obvious.

08:23.263 --> 08:24.630
He wanted hard evidence

08:24.664 --> 08:25.931
against whoever's trafficking,

08:25.966 --> 08:27.600
use as leverage,
force them to give him

08:27.634 --> 08:29.301
a bigger cut of the profits.
I don't know.

08:29.336 --> 08:30.302
You tell me.

08:30.337 --> 08:31.537
He was your friend.

08:33.173 --> 08:34.139
Yeah, he was.

08:34.174 --> 08:35.573
John.

08:35.609 --> 08:37.409
Cooper's wife is here.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.481
JOHN:
Kelly.

08:42.515 --> 08:45.084
John.

08:50.023 --> 08:52.291
I'm so sorry.

08:52.325 --> 08:55.528
This is my partner Dorian.

08:55.562 --> 08:57.229
I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am.

08:58.698 --> 09:00.799
Please tell me
the things that they're saying

09:00.834 --> 09:02.568
about Trevor aren't true.

09:04.838 --> 09:06.338
Cooper was one
of my best detectives,

09:06.373 --> 09:08.340
but he hadn't been actively
undercover for months.

09:08.375 --> 09:09.742
Any reason for that?

09:09.776 --> 09:11.310
Cooper thought
The Bends was gonna

09:11.344 --> 09:13.078
hit the streets in a big way.

09:13.113 --> 09:14.847
He wanting to make a run
at the distributor.

09:14.881 --> 09:17.249
But netting a big fish
like that takes time.

09:17.284 --> 09:19.151
Trying to get
funding and resources

09:19.185 --> 09:20.586
for long-term surveillance
is like pulling teeth.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.588
Yeah, I know.
And they want immediate results.

09:22.622 --> 09:24.757
Yeah, and Cooper
wasn't getting them.

09:24.791 --> 09:27.126
I tried to keep it going
as long as I could,

09:27.160 --> 09:29.161
but when he couldn't
get any arrests...

09:29.195 --> 09:32.398
His personnel reports mentioned
some disciplinary action.

09:32.432 --> 09:35.000
Coop was always
a dog with a bone.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.169
He would get onto something
and wouldn't let it go.

09:37.203 --> 09:38.938
It could rub people
the wrong way.

09:38.972 --> 09:40.973
MALDONADO:
I know the type.

09:40.975 --> 09:43.709
Did Coop tell you anything
about what he was doing?

09:43.743 --> 09:45.611
MALDONADO:
He never took it home.

09:45.645 --> 09:47.313
He didn't like to expose me

09:47.347 --> 09:49.915
to the things he saw on the job.

09:49.950 --> 09:51.684
DORIAN:
Mrs. Cooper?

09:51.718 --> 09:53.352
Did you notice
any changes recently

09:53.386 --> 09:54.587
in your husband's demeanor?

09:54.621 --> 09:56.889
Not really.

09:56.923 --> 09:58.757
I mean, he was stressed.

09:58.792 --> 10:01.694
I figured 'cause of work.

10:01.728 --> 10:03.796
They've been treating him

10:03.830 --> 10:06.565
like he's a criminal
and not one of their own.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.200
He's innocent.

10:08.234 --> 10:09.868
You believe that, don't you?

10:09.903 --> 10:12.838
I do.

10:12.872 --> 10:14.873
But I have to prove it.

10:17.978 --> 10:19.878
So, you believe Cooper was
working a rogue investigation

10:19.913 --> 10:21.246
without the department's say-so.

10:21.281 --> 10:23.382
That's what I would like
to believe, yeah.

10:23.416 --> 10:24.750
And the drugs in his trunk?

10:24.784 --> 10:26.051
Could be planted.

10:26.086 --> 10:27.953
The murder of a cop draws

10:27.988 --> 10:29.488
a lot of heat,
so dirtying Cooper up

10:29.522 --> 10:31.323
is one way to deflect it.

10:31.358 --> 10:33.692
Alex, one of my detectives
looked into Cooper's finances.

10:33.727 --> 10:35.494
She found an account

10:35.528 --> 10:37.963
under his father's name
with recent activity.

10:37.998 --> 10:40.366
Large deposits and withdrawals.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.835
His father passed away
seven years ago.

10:44.037 --> 10:47.172
Look, you know,
I hope I'm wrong,

10:47.207 --> 10:48.641
but if Cooper became
too familiar with the people

10:48.675 --> 10:50.409
he was after,
went in too deep...

10:50.443 --> 10:53.278
I mean, he wouldn't be the first
undercover cop to do so.

10:54.447 --> 10:56.348
I'm gonna have to pursue it.

10:59.352 --> 11:01.754
Look, it's your case...

11:01.788 --> 11:03.288
but Cooper was my man.

11:03.323 --> 11:05.791
So if you find anything,
I'd like to know.

11:05.825 --> 11:07.893
Of course.

11:07.927 --> 11:09.728
Thanks.
Yep.

11:11.464 --> 11:12.731
(sighs)

11:12.766 --> 11:14.433
JOHN:
<i>Can you recall</i>

11:14.467 --> 11:18.337
anything out of the ordinary,
any change of routine?

11:18.371 --> 11:21.240
He, um... took a day off
earlier this week,

11:21.274 --> 11:22.941
to go up to the cabin.

11:22.976 --> 11:24.276
Cabin?

11:24.310 --> 11:25.511
We inherited one

11:25.545 --> 11:28.313
from his father,
on Lake Casalino.

11:28.348 --> 11:30.549
Four walls, no heat.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.584
Coop loved it,
but I was always freezing.

11:32.619 --> 11:34.620
Actually, he was coming back
from the cabin

11:34.654 --> 11:37.256
the night he died...
he was fixing up

11:37.290 --> 11:38.757
(voice breaks):
the fireplace so we could

11:38.792 --> 11:40.426
spend more time up there.

11:42.762 --> 11:44.663
Would you mind
if we go up there

11:44.698 --> 11:46.131
and have a look around?

11:46.166 --> 11:49.401
No, of course not.

11:50.837 --> 11:52.871
DORIAN: <i>What exactly</i>
<i>are we hoping to find up here?</i>

11:52.906 --> 11:57.109
That wire Cooper was wearing
was transmitting to somewhere.

11:57.143 --> 11:59.078
Now, maybe he was
doing more up here

11:59.112 --> 12:01.647
than just fixing his cabin.

12:01.681 --> 12:03.982
You seem entirely convinced
that Cooper was somehow

12:04.017 --> 12:05.784
unfairly set up
by these traffickers.

12:05.819 --> 12:07.119
Cooper was my friend.

12:07.153 --> 12:08.854
And until someone
can prove any different,

12:08.888 --> 12:11.323
he deserves my allegiance.

12:18.465 --> 12:21.433
Ugh, if I had to live
in a cabin, I'd kill myself.

12:21.468 --> 12:22.901
You should buy a cabin, John.

12:22.936 --> 12:24.269
That's cute.

12:24.304 --> 12:26.472
You can walk home.

12:34.481 --> 12:35.781
(door creaks)

12:40.887 --> 12:43.355
Whoever turned over this place

12:43.389 --> 12:45.491
was probably looking for
the same thing that we are.

12:45.525 --> 12:47.860
John, if the same people
that killed Cooper came here,

12:47.894 --> 12:49.728
that means they knew details

12:49.763 --> 12:51.363
- about his life.
- Can you...

12:51.397 --> 12:52.431
Put a protection agent

12:52.465 --> 12:53.999
outside Kelly's house.

12:54.033 --> 12:55.534
You got it.

12:55.568 --> 12:56.802
Thanks, man.

12:56.836 --> 12:59.538
You're welcome, my friend.

12:59.572 --> 13:01.206
Great, now we're friends.

13:01.241 --> 13:03.742
I never thought
I'd miss my coma.

13:08.948 --> 13:11.350
Cooper was the only person
in my class

13:11.384 --> 13:13.585
who could outrun me,
outshoot me...

13:13.620 --> 13:17.089
So there were only two
people in your class?

13:23.196 --> 13:26.031
Kelly said he was working
on the fireplace.

13:26.933 --> 13:30.068
But the Cooper I knew

13:30.103 --> 13:32.905
couldn't even use a hammer.

13:35.441 --> 13:37.409
It's on.

13:37.443 --> 13:38.777
This is the recorder

13:38.812 --> 13:40.546
that Cooper's wire
was transmitting to.

13:42.415 --> 13:45.350
COOPER (on recording): Now does
the finder's fee seem fair?

13:45.385 --> 13:49.588
BISHOP: We're talking 600 liters
of raw product.

13:49.622 --> 13:52.524
I'm gonna need
to see him cook first.

13:52.559 --> 13:53.926
(two gunshots)

13:53.960 --> 13:54.993
COOPER:
What the hell are you doing?!

13:55.028 --> 13:56.662
(three gunshots, Cooper groans)

13:56.696 --> 14:01.066
What-Whatever you're thinking,
you're wrong!

14:01.100 --> 14:04.136
(Cooper panting, groaning)

14:04.170 --> 14:05.337
(gunshot, Cooper groans)

14:07.273 --> 14:09.341
So Cooper got a meeting
with The Bishop?

14:09.375 --> 14:11.109
Vice has been trying
to build a case

14:11.144 --> 14:12.878
against for the last decade.

14:12.912 --> 14:15.047
No one's gotten so much as
a photo, let alone a name.

14:15.081 --> 14:16.315
Cooper found him.

14:16.349 --> 14:18.217
Found him?
He was working with him...

14:18.251 --> 14:19.985
brokering a deal
to sell him a cook.

14:20.019 --> 14:21.820
Perhaps that was the only way
he could get a face-to-face.

14:21.855 --> 14:27.326
Oh, I don't remember
asking the synthetic.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.760
<i>Because The Bends</i>
<i>is so difficult</i>

14:28.795 --> 14:30.195
<i>to harvest from the ocean.</i>

14:30.230 --> 14:31.997
<i>But 600 liters</i>
<i>of raw product...?</i>

14:32.031 --> 14:34.199
PAUL: <i>Looks like someone</i>
<i>found a way to mass produce.</i>

14:34.234 --> 14:35.300
MALDONADO:
<i>That's what The Bishop does.</i>

14:35.335 --> 14:36.635
<i>If his pattern holds,</i>

14:36.669 --> 14:38.337
<i>first he takes out</i>
<i>the competition,</i>

14:38.371 --> 14:40.505
<i>creates aa shortage,</i>
<i>drives up the price.</i>

14:40.540 --> 14:42.908
VALERIE: <i>The Bends is</i>
<i>notoriously addictive.</i>

14:42.942 --> 14:46.445
We could be looking
at an epidemic.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.651
Jimmy...

14:52.685 --> 14:54.686
Jimmy, are you okay?

14:54.721 --> 14:57.322
Jimmy!
He did too much.

15:06.032 --> 15:07.399
You wanted to see me?

15:07.433 --> 15:08.800
We got a call from County;

15:08.835 --> 15:10.802
25 cases of bends overdose.

15:10.837 --> 15:12.004
Five dead already.

15:12.038 --> 15:13.538
Let's finish
what Cooper started.

15:13.573 --> 15:15.040
The Bishop still needs a cook.

15:15.074 --> 15:17.542
I could pose as one,
get a CI to vouch for me.

15:17.577 --> 15:19.878
You can't cook ramen,
let alone The Bends.

15:19.913 --> 15:21.713
Oh, come on. I can cook ramen.

15:21.748 --> 15:23.148
I can order ramen.

15:23.182 --> 15:24.516
John, let's talk about

15:24.550 --> 15:26.852
what's really driving you here.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.253
Cooper was your friend.

15:28.288 --> 15:29.655
You can't help but
make this personal.

15:29.689 --> 15:31.123
But we got kids dying
on the streets here.

15:31.157 --> 15:33.325
We gotta hand this
to Narco, and I'm sorry,

15:33.359 --> 15:35.294
but we gotta put your
friend's case on hold.

15:35.328 --> 15:37.329
Look, this has got nothing
to do with my friend.

15:37.363 --> 15:40.432
This is about
catching The Bishop.

15:40.466 --> 15:42.401
It's been ten years.
This is our best shot.

15:42.435 --> 15:44.002
We finally have
an angle on him.

15:44.037 --> 15:46.037
We know he's desperate
to find a cook for his drug.

15:48.541 --> 15:51.910
If I agreed,
where are we gonna find someone

15:51.945 --> 15:53.445
with a background in chemistry,

15:53.479 --> 15:56.315
that is so good,
so believable in his skill,

15:56.349 --> 15:58.016
he'll convince even The Bishop?

15:58.051 --> 16:00.052
We don't have time for this.

16:00.086 --> 16:01.486
I got just the guy.

16:01.521 --> 16:03.689
You want me to go undercover?

16:03.723 --> 16:05.157
That's what he said, dummy.

16:05.191 --> 16:07.426
You'll be working
on the front lines...

16:07.460 --> 16:09.294
a hero to the department.

16:09.329 --> 16:11.530
You'll be keeping a highly
addictive drug off the streets

16:11.564 --> 16:13.365
and saving countless lives.

16:13.399 --> 16:15.167
All you gotta do
is know how to cook.

16:15.201 --> 16:16.935
And it may not even
get to that, if you get

16:16.970 --> 16:18.704
a face-to-face
with The Bishop first.

16:18.738 --> 16:21.540
Just please consider it.
It's an extremely dangerous job.

16:21.574 --> 16:23.575
But we'll have you under
full surveillance at all times.

16:23.609 --> 16:25.177
You'll never be out of sight.

16:26.846 --> 16:28.080
Full surveillance, yeah?

16:28.114 --> 16:30.682
Yeah, an entire detail
watching you,

16:30.717 --> 16:33.418
ready to move in if anything
should go wrong.

16:39.192 --> 16:40.659
Okay, I'll do it.

16:40.693 --> 16:43.061
I'll do it.
I've already got some ideas

16:43.096 --> 16:45.697
about my alter ego. John...

16:45.732 --> 16:47.866
Fantastic. Why don't you discuss
that with Detective Paul?

16:47.900 --> 16:49.134
He's spent half his
career working Vice.

16:49.168 --> 16:50.902
He'll be prepping you.

16:50.937 --> 16:54.373
Valerie's building you a cover
with a criminal background.

16:54.407 --> 16:55.707
Would I wear a disguise?
Can I wear a disguise?

16:55.742 --> 16:58.043
I don't know...
Sure.

16:58.077 --> 16:59.511
Something sophisticated,
European?

16:59.545 --> 17:03.281
Yeah, absolutely.
Good man.

17:03.316 --> 17:05.117
Where-Where are you guys going?

17:05.151 --> 17:07.719
To find someone
to arrange the meet.

17:07.753 --> 17:09.421
(synthetic head
clears its throat)

17:09.454 --> 17:12.424
So I assume this means
you're abandoning me?

17:12.458 --> 17:14.159
Prick!

17:19.214 --> 17:22.715
JOHN: Every time I come
to this part of town...

17:22.751 --> 17:24.385
the impoverished,
the destitute, the lonely...

17:24.419 --> 17:26.553
DORIAN: How could it
get any worse, man?

17:26.588 --> 17:28.555
They could have you
as a partner?

17:28.590 --> 17:29.690
Ha-ha.

17:29.724 --> 17:31.825
Who's this guy we're after?

17:31.860 --> 17:34.061
Tony Han. A low-level
dealer for The Bishop.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.063
Why is he gonna help us?

17:36.097 --> 17:37.297
'Cause he hates jail.

17:37.332 --> 17:42.636
Hey, uh, this place is, uh...

17:42.671 --> 17:45.205
They don't take too
kindly to androids.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.908
You should wait out here.

18:03.391 --> 18:05.059
(groans)

18:05.894 --> 18:08.095
(rap music playing)

18:19.307 --> 18:22.076
Maybe you should come in
this time.

18:26.047 --> 18:28.382
Callum Waits... convicted
on two counts of possession

18:28.416 --> 18:31.218
with intent to distribute
and manufacture narcotics.

18:31.252 --> 18:32.686
Spent six years on the barge.

18:32.721 --> 18:34.088
Sentence reduced
for good behavior.

18:34.122 --> 18:35.355
PAUL:
That's nice work.

18:35.390 --> 18:36.790
It'll get him in the door.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.459
The rest is up to Rudy.

18:38.493 --> 18:42.129
RUDY: Can I get some "Pomp
and Circumstance," please?

18:42.163 --> 18:43.797
(weakly hums fanfare)

18:46.468 --> 18:47.634
No.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.036
Absolutely not.

18:49.070 --> 18:50.571
Callum Waits wears a fedora..

18:50.605 --> 18:52.039
No. No, no, no... no.
I like it.

18:52.073 --> 18:55.175
Callum Waits wears
what I tell him to wear.

18:56.444 --> 18:58.645
Can we get back to work?

18:58.680 --> 19:00.314
Yeah, now that all
the fun's gone,

19:00.348 --> 19:01.682
I guess that's all there is.

19:01.716 --> 19:02.850
Okay, lesson number one:

19:02.884 --> 19:06.587
convince me you're not you.

19:06.621 --> 19:07.421
Whoa!

19:09.991 --> 19:12.593
(groaning)

19:18.166 --> 19:20.334
Oh, God, I thought
you were dead.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.669
Well, in the afterlife,
you're still a dealer.

19:22.704 --> 19:25.205
3.6 milliliters of The Bends.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.640
3.6 milliliters
of The Bends.

19:26.674 --> 19:28.642
That's 18 to 24
in the cubes, pal.

19:28.676 --> 19:30.477
Come on.
Unless you want to cut a deal.

19:30.512 --> 19:33.080
Last time I did you a favor,
Iggy tried to cut my throat.

19:33.114 --> 19:34.982
(gasps) Lucky for you,
he couldn't find it.

19:35.016 --> 19:38.986
Okay, okay,
what do you want me to do?

19:44.759 --> 19:46.994
I want you to broker a meeting

19:47.028 --> 19:49.296
between The Bishop
and a new cook.

19:49.330 --> 19:51.565
(scoffs)

19:51.599 --> 19:53.000
Are you insane?

19:53.034 --> 19:55.169
Occasionally he is.

19:58.139 --> 19:59.773
What's it gonna be, Tony?

19:59.808 --> 20:01.809
It's gonna cost you
something big.

20:01.843 --> 20:04.645
Try me.
I'm in a generous mood.

20:08.483 --> 20:10.350
My girl got pulled over
a couple months back.

20:10.385 --> 20:11.952
The cops found a few guns.

20:11.986 --> 20:16.056
She's got prio,
ich means major time.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.791
What's her name?

20:17.826 --> 20:19.259
Maya Davis.

20:19.294 --> 20:21.995
She got booked downtown.

20:23.231 --> 20:25.332
Access the docket
in the 11th District.

20:25.366 --> 20:26.800
Dismiss the charges;
officer's discretion.

20:26.835 --> 20:28.735
John, we need
clearance for that...

20:28.770 --> 20:31.371
Just do it.

20:33.741 --> 20:36.877
Set the meeting.

20:36.911 --> 20:38.846
VALERIE: What was the date
of your first arrest?

20:38.880 --> 20:40.013
RUDY:
March the 29, 2014.

20:40.048 --> 20:41.548
Where were you born?

20:41.583 --> 20:43.450
Newcastle. Until my mom
moved us to Reading

20:43.484 --> 20:45.018
when my dad died of the scales.

20:45.053 --> 20:46.773
Who taught you how to cook?
Uh, Dr. Darmadi.

20:46.788 --> 20:50.023
Spent an endless summer in
Guam for a couple of years...

20:50.058 --> 20:52.326
Are you mad?!
That's a 100-millileter...

20:52.360 --> 20:54.995
You were picked up by a Narco
task force last December.

20:55.029 --> 20:57.564
What was the charge?

20:58.633 --> 20:59.733
What was the charge?!

21:02.070 --> 21:04.972
What are the color of the
holding cells on the barge?

21:05.006 --> 21:06.406
Richard...

21:06.441 --> 21:09.476
What color?
Blue.

21:09.510 --> 21:11.745
Until they repainted them gray.

21:11.779 --> 21:14.815
Okay.

21:14.849 --> 21:16.416
Good.

21:16.451 --> 21:19.720
I'm sorry, but you kept
your concentration.

21:19.754 --> 21:22.122
When you're undercover,
nothing's perfect.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.625
Not your cover story,
not the product.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.494
The only thing that has
to remain steady is you.

21:27.528 --> 21:30.597
If everything falls apart,
you fall back on the truth.

21:30.632 --> 21:32.966
Keep your lies as close
to the truth as possible.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.234
The truth is your friend.

21:34.269 --> 21:36.637
Especially when
you're telling a lie.

21:36.671 --> 21:38.105
Got it.
Good.

21:38.139 --> 21:41.008
Now let's see if you can cook.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.178
No hat.

21:47.849 --> 21:50.651
RUDY: <i>Compound is</i>
<i>rather simple, actually.</i>

21:50.685 --> 21:52.519
You get your methyl nitrate,

21:52.553 --> 21:54.021
you add a simple chloride...

21:54.055 --> 21:57.257
(whistling)

21:57.292 --> 21:59.259
...put it in here.

22:01.462 --> 22:03.931
Set the pressure cooker to...

22:03.965 --> 22:08.001
exactly 457 degrees and...

22:08.036 --> 22:09.436
it's easy peasy.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.006
Is it supposed to do that?

22:13.041 --> 22:15.175
(rattling, hissing)

22:25.186 --> 22:27.054
Oops.

22:28.489 --> 22:30.390
Forgot the iodine.

22:38.866 --> 22:40.500
Easy peasy, huh?

22:45.269 --> 22:47.537
(siren chirping)

22:47.572 --> 22:49.573
Okay.

22:49.607 --> 22:51.908
So I called in
every favor I have.

22:51.943 --> 22:53.210
My ass is on the line.

22:53.244 --> 22:54.377
You understand what
that means, right?

22:54.412 --> 22:55.779
This don't work, it ain't

22:55.813 --> 22:57.247
"we don't do no more
business together" bad.

22:57.281 --> 22:58.715
It's "kill my girlfriend
and kid" bad.

22:58.749 --> 22:59.883
Where's the meet?

23:01.319 --> 23:03.119
The Bishop wants to meet
your cook at pier four

23:03.154 --> 23:04.788
in the Defense District, in one
of those old abandoned buildings.

23:04.822 --> 23:06.323
It makes sense.

23:06.357 --> 23:07.924
It's isolated, discreet.

23:07.959 --> 23:09.893
This whole thing
only works if The Bishop

23:09.927 --> 23:12.229
turns up in person, you understand that?
Yeah, he'll the.

23:12.263 --> 23:14.130
He's got a lot of people
waiting for this product.

23:14.165 --> 23:17.400
Let's hope your guy knows
what he's walking into.

23:19.270 --> 23:20.403
JOHN:
<i>Rudy, how you feeling?</i>

23:20.438 --> 23:21.559
RUDY:
<i>Well, actually, John...</i>

23:21.572 --> 23:23.139
JOHN:
<i>Good to hear.</i>

23:23.174 --> 23:25.408
What's the one thing
you gotta remember?

23:25.443 --> 23:27.277
Uh... don't mess
up the drugs?

23:27.311 --> 23:28.445
Don't get killed?

23:28.479 --> 23:29.846
Don't soil myself?

23:29.881 --> 23:32.015
(stammers) You gotta
get The Bishop to say

23:32.049 --> 23:33.250
that he distributes narcotics.

23:33.284 --> 23:35.285
No problem.
Keep him talking.

23:35.319 --> 23:36.853
JOHN: The more we can learn
about his operation,

23:36.888 --> 23:38.455
the better a case
we can build against him.

23:38.489 --> 23:39.923
Do we need
to go over this again?

23:39.957 --> 23:41.258
RUDY:
I got it, I got it.

23:41.292 --> 23:42.926
Well...

23:42.960 --> 23:44.160
here goes nothing.

23:44.195 --> 23:46.463
I... I'll just, uh...

23:46.497 --> 23:47.464
No.

23:51.068 --> 23:51.935
No.

23:54.472 --> 23:57.007
Bottoms up.

23:59.510 --> 24:01.478
You sure that's gonna work?

24:01.512 --> 24:02.913
The department's
still beta testing,

24:02.947 --> 24:04.447
but theoretically, it should...

24:04.482 --> 24:05.615
(shudders)

24:08.753 --> 24:09.920
...make my whole body

24:09.954 --> 24:12.589
into an undetectable
GPS locator.

24:12.623 --> 24:14.591
And tracking beacon for
same-platform technology.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.960
(farting)

24:19.630 --> 24:20.897
There.

24:20.932 --> 24:22.532
(computer beeps)

24:22.567 --> 24:24.367
There I am.

24:25.670 --> 24:27.037
MALDONADO:
All right.

24:27.071 --> 24:28.438
We're tracking Rudy
here, as well.

24:28.472 --> 24:29.952
(over comm):
Under your command, John.

24:30.708 --> 24:32.142
DORIAN:
Rudy.

24:32.176 --> 24:34.044
You okay?

24:34.078 --> 24:35.979
Yeah. Pumped.

24:36.013 --> 24:38.081
Let's, uh...

24:38.115 --> 24:39.516
rock and-and roll.

24:39.550 --> 24:40.684
Let's rock and roll.

24:40.718 --> 24:42.519
All right. Let's do it. Yeah.

24:42.553 --> 24:43.753
JOHN:
You can do this, Rudy!

24:43.788 --> 24:46.156
Bring it home!
You got this!

24:47.558 --> 24:49.859
He's gonna die.

25:16.621 --> 25:17.520
(beeping)

25:19.323 --> 25:22.025
Roaches are set.

25:22.059 --> 25:23.860
I've got a visual.

25:26.897 --> 25:29.032
(knocking on door)

25:29.934 --> 25:31.835
JOHN:
He's in.

25:31.869 --> 25:35.372
VX: Stop.
Put your hands out.

25:40.878 --> 25:42.312
Ooh! Bonus.

25:43.547 --> 25:44.848
It's, uh...

25:44.882 --> 25:46.249
small but powerful.

25:47.785 --> 25:50.286
(glass shatters)

25:54.992 --> 25:56.159
I'm Cruz.

25:56.193 --> 25:57.560
I'm Rudy.

25:57.595 --> 25:58.928
(gasps)

25:58.963 --> 26:00.964
Did he just tell 'em
his real name?

26:02.033 --> 26:03.233
Thought your name
was Callum Waits.

26:03.267 --> 26:04.334
Yeah.

26:04.368 --> 26:05.835
Callum Randolph Waits, yeah.

26:05.870 --> 26:07.037
Rudy for short.

26:07.071 --> 26:09.005
We gotta go in.
Wait, wait.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.241
Let me go in alone... we can
still salvage this mission.

26:11.242 --> 26:13.076
What are you doing?

26:13.110 --> 26:14.431
DORIAN:
They can't know I'm a cop,

26:14.445 --> 26:15.912
so I'm shutting down
all my comm relays

26:15.946 --> 26:17.614
so they won't detect
any outgoing transmissions.

26:17.648 --> 26:18.682
Are you kidding?

26:18.716 --> 26:20.183
We'll have no way to
communicate with you.

26:20.217 --> 26:21.551
Do it.

26:21.585 --> 26:23.953
You gotta do it.

26:23.988 --> 26:27.290
If anything goes down,
you're Rudy's only hope.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.459
RUDY:
...because... well, anyway...

26:29.493 --> 26:31.761
I mean, anyone else thirsty?

26:31.796 --> 26:33.163
If you've got flavored vodka,

26:33.197 --> 26:34.831
I can... I can make you
some cocktails.

26:34.865 --> 26:37.333
(gun clicks)

26:38.536 --> 26:41.938
(farts)

26:41.972 --> 26:43.440
Are you kidding me?

26:46.577 --> 26:48.945
Excuse me.

26:48.979 --> 26:51.481
(knocking on door)

26:54.218 --> 26:55.652
DORIAN:
Uh, Dolph...

26:55.686 --> 26:56.953
Okay, take it easy.

26:56.987 --> 26:58.188
All right, Dolph.

26:58.222 --> 26:59.889
I just have your glasses.

26:59.924 --> 27:01.491
Way to go, John.

27:01.525 --> 27:02.992
Really got our best
and brightest in there.

27:03.027 --> 27:05.295
Yeah. Explains why you're
not in there. Guys...

27:05.329 --> 27:07.630
DORIAN: Tell them to call off
this busted refrigerator

27:07.665 --> 27:09.065
before I send him back
to the scrap pile.

27:09.100 --> 27:10.366
CRUZ: You were supposed
to come alone.

27:10.401 --> 27:12.535
TEMPESCO:
He's a DRN.

27:12.570 --> 27:14.738
This bot's police issue.

27:14.772 --> 27:16.072
He <i>was</i> police issue.

27:16.107 --> 27:17.741
Until they malfunctioned.

27:17.775 --> 27:19.075
I found him on the black market

27:19.110 --> 27:21.911
and completely refurbished him.

27:21.946 --> 27:23.980
Come on...
we've all got bots here.

27:24.014 --> 27:26.015
(exhales)

27:26.050 --> 27:27.383
Let him go.

27:32.456 --> 27:34.991
Let's go.

27:39.497 --> 27:40.730
Okay, we're good.

27:40.765 --> 27:43.366
(sighs)

27:48.372 --> 27:50.540
Well, the ventilation
could be better.

27:50.574 --> 27:53.409
Guys, I've got a facial rec.

27:53.444 --> 27:55.378
Effren Cruz.

27:55.412 --> 27:58.982
Charges for weapons,
assault and robbery.

27:59.016 --> 28:00.416
These Erlenmeyer
flasks are filthy.

28:00.451 --> 28:02.719
Whose lab was this?
Sweeney Todd?

28:02.753 --> 28:04.254
CRUZ: Enough talk.
You've 60 seconds.

28:04.288 --> 28:05.522
Let's see what you can do.

28:05.556 --> 28:06.990
Well, if I get this job,

28:07.024 --> 28:08.324
there's gonna be some
changes around here.

28:08.359 --> 28:09.692
(timer ticking)

28:14.431 --> 28:16.266
(sniffs)

28:21.505 --> 28:23.873
(machine whirring)

28:30.981 --> 28:32.015
Done.

28:32.049 --> 28:34.584
(over comm):
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

28:34.618 --> 28:35.885
Taste perfection.

28:42.126 --> 28:43.359
It's 95% pure.

28:43.394 --> 28:44.394
Come on.

28:44.428 --> 28:46.596
This cook is now a chef.

28:48.098 --> 28:50.433
THE BISHOP: You are indeed
quite a chef, Callum.

28:50.467 --> 28:51.835
(claps)

28:59.109 --> 29:00.509
Wait a minute,
where'd he come from?

29:02.513 --> 29:04.013
Are you The Bishop?

29:11.722 --> 29:14.424
Stay there.

29:18.529 --> 29:19.896
Got a hit.

29:19.930 --> 29:21.798
Gavin Maxwell.

29:21.832 --> 29:23.132
JOHN: He's gotta
be The Bishop.

29:23.167 --> 29:25.301
Second they make
the deal, we move in.

29:25.336 --> 29:27.871
So how did you choose
the name Bishop?

29:27.905 --> 29:29.639
Is that a chess thing?

29:29.673 --> 29:32.508
It's just... there was this, uh,
great chess Grandmaster

29:32.543 --> 29:34.510
who was once asked,
"Do you prefer the queen

29:34.545 --> 29:36.012
on the bed
or on the board?"

29:36.046 --> 29:37.580
He said, "Depends on
the position."

29:37.615 --> 29:39.749
(laughs)
Which is... is funny...

29:39.783 --> 29:41.217
Um, so...

29:41.252 --> 29:43.953
how much, uh, weight
are-are we moving?

29:52.263 --> 29:53.997
VALERIE:
What is that?

29:56.834 --> 29:59.903
It's-it's just that
I'm a bit...

29:59.937 --> 30:01.871
emp-empty stomach, and...

30:10.514 --> 30:11.981
Wait. What just happened?

30:12.016 --> 30:13.377
VALERIE:
We lost Rudy's GPS signal.

30:13.384 --> 30:15.518
Move, move, move!
Let's go! All teams, go!

30:15.552 --> 30:17.487
All right.

30:17.521 --> 30:19.656
Let's go to the real lab.

30:24.461 --> 30:26.095
Police!

30:26.130 --> 30:27.864
(gunshot, Cruz yells)

30:31.869 --> 30:33.670
PAUL: We searched everywhere.
Rudy's not here.

30:33.704 --> 30:35.505
That's impossible.
We had eyes on every exit.

30:37.441 --> 30:39.876
He's gone.

30:50.134 --> 30:52.869
We've got three pressure
synthesizers in here,

30:52.903 --> 30:54.470
so we can process

30:54.505 --> 30:56.406
while we treat the product
in its chemical bath.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.041
(gasps)

30:58.075 --> 30:59.995
It's like being able to
do three loads of laundry

31:00.010 --> 31:01.211
at the same time.

31:01.245 --> 31:03.079
(grunts)

31:03.113 --> 31:05.648
CRUZ:
Please...

31:05.683 --> 31:06.816
Where did they take him?

31:06.850 --> 31:08.885
I told you.

31:08.919 --> 31:10.086
I don't know anything.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.421
You shot me in the leg!

31:11.455 --> 31:13.022
I need a doctor.

31:13.057 --> 31:14.490
(yells)

31:14.525 --> 31:16.826
(groans) DORIAN:
You'll get a doctor

31:16.860 --> 31:18.761
- when you tell us where The
Bishop took Rudy. - All right,

31:18.796 --> 31:20.263
okay, stop!

31:20.297 --> 31:22.332
Maxwell's not The Bishop.

31:23.567 --> 31:25.001
Nobody meets The Bishop.

31:26.971 --> 31:29.706
DORIAN: <i>Cruz's vitals suggest</i>
<i>he's telling the truth.</i>

31:29.740 --> 31:31.374
He's told us all he knows.

31:31.408 --> 31:32.775
But if Maxwell
isn't The Bishop,

31:32.810 --> 31:33.977
then who is?

31:34.011 --> 31:36.012
VALERIE:
Hey, guys...

31:40.251 --> 31:41.484
DORIAN:
The GPS solvent

31:41.518 --> 31:42.719
Rudy took so we
could track him...

31:42.753 --> 31:43.820
this is the counteragent.

31:43.854 --> 31:45.054
That's impossible.

31:45.089 --> 31:46.256
The police department

31:46.290 --> 31:47.890
only developed
this tech weeks ago.

31:47.925 --> 31:50.994
JOHN: They must have
somebody on the inside.

31:51.028 --> 31:52.668
MALDONADO:
John, that's a huge accusation

31:52.696 --> 31:54.097
to have floating
around the precinct.

31:54.131 --> 31:56.165
They gave Rudy
the GPS counteragent.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.400
How else can you explain that,

31:57.434 --> 31:59.235
unless someone from PD
gave it to them?

31:59.270 --> 32:01.037
JOHN:
Pull up Maxwell's priors.

32:01.071 --> 32:03.172
I've got his file up.
It looks like

32:03.207 --> 32:05.475
Maxwell beat a major
distribution charge.

32:05.509 --> 32:07.076
It says Maxwell's case
was thrown out

32:07.111 --> 32:08.611
due to lack of evidence.

32:08.646 --> 32:10.546
JOHN: Who signed the papers
for his release?

32:10.581 --> 32:13.249
MALDONADO:
Captain Barros.

32:15.853 --> 32:17.487
(over comm):
Barros is The Bishop.

32:27.831 --> 32:30.166
So, Callum...

32:30.200 --> 32:31.901
what do you think of my setup?

32:33.470 --> 32:35.638
I think I want to get
in bed with you.

32:36.974 --> 32:38.775
Uh, I mean... not...
I don't mean like that.

32:38.809 --> 32:40.276
I... you know
what I mean.

32:40.311 --> 32:42.245
(phone ringing)

32:46.517 --> 32:49.052
Captain Maldonado.

32:49.086 --> 32:50.820
MALDONADO:
Alex. You said you wanted

32:50.854 --> 32:52.322
to be kept in the loop
regarding Detective Cooper.

32:52.356 --> 32:53.556
Out of respect,

32:53.590 --> 32:55.491
I wanted to update you.

32:55.526 --> 32:57.026
We talked to his wife,

32:57.061 --> 32:59.062
and found out he had a cabin
outside the city.

32:59.096 --> 33:00.697
I sent a couple of my men
to check it out.

33:00.731 --> 33:01.931
- Did you find anything?
- Nope.

33:01.965 --> 33:03.433
Someone got there before us.

33:03.467 --> 33:06.102
Probably whoever Cooper
was working with.

33:06.136 --> 33:07.670
So... back to square one.

33:09.206 --> 33:10.373
I'm sorry to hear that.

33:10.407 --> 33:12.108
Me, too.

33:12.142 --> 33:13.843
I'll let you know
if anything develops.

33:13.877 --> 33:15.378
I appreciate the update.

33:16.380 --> 33:17.513
Yeah.

33:17.548 --> 33:19.482
Got him.

33:19.516 --> 33:20.683
He's at the old.

33:20.718 --> 33:22.685
<i>Ironworks District</i>
<i>on Dunn Street.</i>

33:22.720 --> 33:24.787
We're seven minutes out.

33:24.822 --> 33:25.988
Copy.

33:26.023 --> 33:28.324
So I've had more
than a dozen cooks

33:28.359 --> 33:30.993
trying to perfect The Bends.

33:31.028 --> 33:32.729
You've come closer than anyone.

33:34.598 --> 33:35.798
Um...

33:35.833 --> 33:37.133
It's...

33:37.167 --> 33:38.401
uh...

33:38.435 --> 33:40.636
it's about passion.

33:42.072 --> 33:43.573
(clears throat)

33:43.607 --> 33:45.608
Passion in your work.

33:45.642 --> 33:48.411
It's science, yes,
but it's also an art.

33:48.445 --> 33:51.381
Ingredients are
ingredients, but...

33:51.415 --> 33:54.350
if you go quiet
and you just listen...

33:55.886 --> 33:58.721
...they start to
talk back to you

33:58.756 --> 34:01.357
and they tell you
what they need,

34:01.392 --> 34:04.293
and the whole becomes greater
than the sum of the parts.

34:04.328 --> 34:05.995
Take-take your robot,
for instance...

34:06.029 --> 34:09.431
so many disparate
ideas and-and concepts

34:09.466 --> 34:11.333
that all need to come together,

34:11.368 --> 34:13.536
but if you approach your
work with reverence

34:13.570 --> 34:15.972
and pour your
very soul into it,

34:16.005 --> 34:18.674
it starts to get
a life of its own.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.275
And, dare I say,

34:20.310 --> 34:24.847
you can grow very
fond of that creation.

34:28.585 --> 34:31.954
Did you make the droids
or did you do them?

34:31.989 --> 34:35.425
(laughing)

34:37.226 --> 34:41.264
I have to admit, you have
a very unique perspective.

34:43.434 --> 34:45.568
And I think
you're gonna fit in here.

34:45.601 --> 34:49.237
Call the others and tell them
to bring in the materials.

34:49.273 --> 34:51.808
Thank you for the opportunity.

34:51.842 --> 34:53.743
You won't regret it.
(chuckles)

34:56.079 --> 34:58.347
(phone line ringing)

34:58.382 --> 35:02.718
(phone ringing)

35:02.753 --> 35:05.621
No one is picking up.

35:05.656 --> 35:08.224
It just keeps ringing.
Call him again.

35:08.258 --> 35:12.795
(phone beeps three times)

35:12.830 --> 35:14.831
(phone line rings)

35:14.865 --> 35:18.301
VX:
He's still not picking up.

35:18.335 --> 35:20.136
MAXWELL: He's supposed to be
waiting for our call.

35:20.170 --> 35:22.405
There's no reason
for him not to answer.

35:22.439 --> 35:23.940
VX:
This is not like him.

35:23.974 --> 35:26.609
Something must be wrong.

35:26.643 --> 35:29.178
(phone line ringing)

35:33.016 --> 35:34.851
(steam hissing)

35:36.186 --> 35:38.254
Get him!

35:39.723 --> 35:40.957
(gunshot)

36:04.548 --> 36:06.682
(ragged breathing)

36:13.675 --> 36:17.111
?

36:17.145 --> 36:18.546
(gunshots) (grunts)

36:37.465 --> 36:38.566
I see him!

36:38.600 --> 36:39.900
Move!

36:49.945 --> 36:51.879
(panting)

36:51.913 --> 36:53.647
DORIAN:
Rudy!

36:54.683 --> 36:56.350
Let's get you down from there.

37:18.473 --> 37:20.507
(gunfire)

37:21.977 --> 37:24.178
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Alert...
weapon not functioning.

37:24.212 --> 37:25.879
Oh, great.

37:34.055 --> 37:37.224
(grunting)

37:47.502 --> 37:50.537
(electronic whirring, blipping)

38:03.385 --> 38:04.251
(Barros grunts)

38:04.285 --> 38:07.187
(grunting)

38:17.432 --> 38:19.199
(buzzing)

38:33.248 --> 38:36.283
(electronic buzzing, blipping)

38:37.886 --> 38:39.019
(buzzing, crackling)

38:43.591 --> 38:45.893
(grunting)

38:50.699 --> 38:53.067
(panting)

38:53.101 --> 38:55.602
(Barros coughs)

38:59.874 --> 39:02.309
You stupid cop.

39:04.112 --> 39:07.114
I'll bury you like I buried
your loser friend Cooper.

39:07.148 --> 39:09.249
I'm a captain.

39:10.351 --> 39:11.919
This will be a mistrial...

39:18.026 --> 39:21.295
(applause, laughter)

39:21.329 --> 39:24.131
Look, you'll probably have
a scar but no long-term damage.

39:24.165 --> 39:26.300
A scar?
H-How big of a scar?

39:26.334 --> 39:28.502
You forgot something back there.

39:28.536 --> 39:29.670
JOHN:
Look, Rudy,

39:29.704 --> 39:31.472
you did a-a really terrific job.

39:31.506 --> 39:33.787
I'll be ready for my next
assignment in a couple of weeks.

39:35.009 --> 39:36.944
Uh, yeah, look, Rudy,

39:36.978 --> 39:38.178
about that...

39:38.213 --> 39:39.747
You guys think I'm too fragile.

39:39.781 --> 39:42.716
I got a friend
who trains horses.

39:42.751 --> 39:44.485
I was thinking of having
him take me out,

39:44.519 --> 39:46.153
bulk me up a bit.

39:47.388 --> 39:49.389
MALDONADO:
John...?

39:49.424 --> 39:52.626
Great job.

39:55.196 --> 39:57.297
Kelly.

39:58.566 --> 40:00.534
I came by to thank you

40:00.568 --> 40:02.369
for not giving up on my husband.

40:02.403 --> 40:05.038
Look, Coop would've done
the same thing for me.

40:05.073 --> 40:07.975
You're a good man.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.288
(siren chirping, blipping)

40:27.929 --> 40:30.330
There's been a slight change
of plans. We're going to...

40:30.365 --> 40:31.665
McQuaid's.

40:31.699 --> 40:33.867
McQuaid's? Oh, come on, man.

40:33.902 --> 40:35.569
No way. That's-that's my bar.

40:35.603 --> 40:37.638
I told Rudy we would
take him out to celebrate.

40:37.672 --> 40:40.808
(chuckles)

40:40.842 --> 40:42.242
You gotta be kidding me.

40:46.681 --> 40:50.184
Okay, fine... I'll take
you guys to McQuaid's.

40:50.218 --> 40:51.418
McQuaid's.

40:51.452 --> 40:52.619
A genuine cop bar.

40:52.654 --> 40:54.188
We can drink martinis.

40:54.222 --> 40:55.522
We'll be drinking beers.

40:55.557 --> 40:57.257
Do you think the, uh...
the badge rabbits

40:57.292 --> 40:58.992
will go for the hat?
Badge bunnies,

40:59.027 --> 41:01.595
Rudy... they're-they're
called "badge bunnies."

41:01.629 --> 41:02.829
But don't ever call them that.

41:02.831 --> 41:04.932
And there are a few rules.

41:04.966 --> 41:06.533
- Such as...?
- First of all,

41:06.568 --> 41:08.936
you got to promise me
not to embarrass me, okay?

41:08.970 --> 41:11.605
Secondly, don't talk
about your test tubes.

41:11.639 --> 41:12.940
Is that a euphemism?

41:14.375 --> 41:16.510
No. Is there a third rule?

41:16.544 --> 41:19.046
JOHN: Yeah.
Pretend we just met.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.569
(starts engine)

41:21.587 --> 41:24.176
RUDY: <i>Um, any chance</i>
<i>we can get into a bar fight?</i>

41:24.202 --> 41:25.245
JOHN and DORIAN:
<i>No.</i>
