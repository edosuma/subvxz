02:48.368 --> 02:50.037
Thank you,
George.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.673
From the point of view
of the criminal expert,

02:52.806 --> 02:57.077
London has become
a singularly odd,

02:57.177 --> 02:58.545
interesting city.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.447
Well, I hardly
think you'll find

03:00.547 --> 03:02.583
many decent citizens
to agree with you.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.185
Well, well, well,
one must not be selfish.

03:05.285 --> 03:06.987
The community's
the gain,

03:07.087 --> 03:09.056
and no one the loser
say the poor,

03:09.156 --> 03:12.392
unfortunate specialist
whose occupation was got.

03:18.799 --> 03:22.936
You must have
been totally...

03:23.036 --> 03:28.509
There's the case of the
papers of ex-President...

03:31.144 --> 03:34.681
and shocking affair of the
Dutch steamship Treesman,

03:34.815 --> 03:37.718
which very nearly cost
us both our lives.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.587
Both of them
great successes.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.823
I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes
is not at home.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.359
If I fail to see him now,
it will be too late.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.361
But I'm sorry,
I cannot help you.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.630
But it is a matter
of the utmost urgency.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.198
I have already told you,
young man, Mr. Holmes ...

03:51.331 --> 03:53.000
Mr. Holmes!

03:53.100 --> 03:54.768
Well, I must see you.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.336
I told the young man
you weren't here,

03:56.470 --> 03:57.771
but he
wouldn't listen.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.507
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but
I'm nearly out of my mind.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.076
I am the unhappy
John Hector McFarland.

04:12.819 --> 04:16.223
Now, tell us quietly
and slowly who you are

04:16.322 --> 04:17.958
and what it is
that you want.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.161
You mentioned your
name just now

04:21.261 --> 04:22.396
as if I should
recognize it,

04:22.496 --> 04:23.764
but I can
assure you,

04:23.864 --> 04:25.732
beyond the obvious facts
that you are a bachelor,

04:25.833 --> 04:28.268
a solicitor and a free
mason and an asthmatic,

04:28.368 --> 04:29.803
I know nothing
about you whatever.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.610
Your untidy clothes,
sheaf of legal papers,

04:36.743 --> 04:39.513
watch chain and your somewhat
irregular breathing.

04:39.613 --> 04:44.751
Why, yes, Mr. Holmes,
I am all these things.

04:44.852 --> 04:48.789
And in addition,
I am at this moment,

04:48.889 --> 04:51.391
the most unfortunate
man in London.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.494
I mean, I've read
your newspaper ...

04:53.627 --> 04:54.828
Not yet.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.463
Then, if you
would allow me.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.906
"At about 12 o'clock
last night,

05:06.006 --> 05:08.342
an instance occurred at
Lower Norwood which points,

05:08.442 --> 05:10.944
it is feared,
to a serious crime.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.814
A small timber yard caught
fire at the back of a house

05:13.914 --> 05:17.150
belonging to Mr. Jonas
Oldacre, a builder.

05:17.251 --> 05:20.487
Surprise was expressed
at Mr. Oldacre's absence,

05:20.587 --> 05:23.991
and it became apparent
he had disappeared.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.293
An examination
of his room

05:26.393 --> 05:29.062
revealed a safe
which was open,

05:29.163 --> 05:32.032
signs of a
murderous struggle,

05:32.132 --> 05:33.634
and a heavy
walking stick

05:33.767 --> 05:36.036
with stains of blood
upon the handle.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.237
As we ..."

05:37.337 --> 05:40.174
All I ask is that you
don't abandon me.

05:40.274 --> 05:42.643
A man has followed me
from London Bridge Station.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.978
If they arrest me before
I finish my story,

05:45.078 --> 05:46.113
make them
give me time

05:46.246 --> 05:48.215
so that I may tell
you the whole truth.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.750
I could go
to jail happy

05:49.850 --> 05:51.985
if I knew that you were
outside working for me.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.253
Arrest you?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.355
This is really
most gratifying.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.424
On what charge do you
expect to be arrested?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.226
Upon the charge
of murdering

05:59.326 --> 06:01.628
Mr. Jonas Oldacre
of Lower Norwood.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.398
Dear me!

06:09.369 --> 06:11.805
"As we go to press,

06:11.905 --> 06:14.341
sensational developments
have been reported.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.476
Charred remains
have been found

06:16.610 --> 06:19.079
among the ashes
of the fire,

06:19.213 --> 06:22.349
and the police theory
is that the victim

06:22.449 --> 06:25.586
was clubbed to death
and the body ignited.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.955
It is known
that Mr. Oldacre

06:28.055 --> 06:29.957
received a visitor
last night,

06:30.057 --> 06:32.426
and the stick has
been identified

06:32.526 --> 06:34.561
as belonging
to that person,

06:34.695 --> 06:36.363
a young London
solicitor,

06:36.463 --> 06:39.600
by the name of
John Hector McFarland."

06:44.238 --> 06:47.441
May I ask why you are still
at liberty, Mr. McFarland,

06:47.541 --> 06:51.645
as there seems to be
enough evidence

06:51.745 --> 06:53.614
to justify
your arrest?

06:53.714 --> 06:54.882
I live with
my mother,

06:54.982 --> 06:56.517
at Torrington Lodge
in Blackheath,

06:56.650 --> 06:57.584
but last night,

06:57.684 --> 06:59.620
having late business
with Mr. Oldacre,

06:59.720 --> 07:00.988
I stayed at a hotel
in Norwood.

07:05.225 --> 07:08.795
Mr. Holmes, I knew
nothing of this affair

07:08.896 --> 07:11.565
until I was on the train
to my office this morning

07:11.665 --> 07:13.967
and read what you
have just heard.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.670
I saw at once the terrible
danger of my position

07:16.770 --> 07:19.940
and hurried to put the
case in your hands.

07:38.425 --> 07:42.396
Ah, Inspector Le Strade,

07:42.529 --> 07:45.399
we have been
expecting you.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.134
Mr. Holmes?

07:47.234 --> 07:48.502
Dr. Watson?

07:48.602 --> 07:52.105
Mr. John Hector McFarland?

07:52.239 --> 07:53.640
Yes.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.709
I arrest you
for the willful murder

07:55.809 --> 07:58.011
of Mr. Jonas Oldacre
of Lower Norwood.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.446
Hold up,
just one moment.

07:59.546 --> 08:00.981
A half an hour
more or less

08:01.081 --> 08:02.382
could make little
difference to you,

08:02.482 --> 08:04.451
and this young gentleman was
about to give us an account

08:04.551 --> 08:05.886
of this very
interesting affair,

08:05.986 --> 08:07.354
which might aid us
in clearing it up.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.423
There will be no difficulty
in clearing it up,

08:09.523 --> 08:10.691
thank you,
Mr. Holmes.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.626
Nevertheless, I think
with your permission,

08:12.726 --> 08:15.095
I would be much interested
in hearing his account.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.730
Well, Mr. Holmes,

08:16.864 --> 08:18.899
there's no denying
that you have been

08:19.032 --> 08:20.501
of use to the force

08:20.601 --> 08:24.471
once or twice in the past,
but I must insist ...

08:24.571 --> 08:26.707
All I ask is that
you should hear

08:26.807 --> 08:29.276
and recognize
the absolute truth.

08:33.179 --> 08:37.217
I'll give you
half an hour.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.186
Sit down, McFarland.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.196
Thank you, Le Strade.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.268
We must warn you with
what you say now

08:54.368 --> 08:56.703
will appear in evidence
against you.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.907
Pray continue.

09:00.007 --> 09:04.344
I must first explain
that I knew nothing

09:04.444 --> 09:06.613
of Mr. Jonas Oldacre,

09:06.713 --> 09:10.651
although his name
was familiar to me.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.654
Many years ago, my parents
were acquainted with him,

09:13.754 --> 09:16.256
but ... well,
they drifted apart.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.892
And so it came
as a complete surprise

09:19.026 --> 09:22.529
when yesterday afternoon,
at about 3 o'clock,

09:22.663 --> 09:24.531
he walked into my
office in the city.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.536
"Mr. Oldacre,
good afternoon,

09:29.636 --> 09:31.071
I'm Mr. McFarland.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.173
Would you care
to come through?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.680
Please, won't
you sit down?

09:46.286 --> 09:47.588
How can I help you?

09:54.528 --> 09:57.498
This is a draft
of my Will.

09:57.631 --> 10:00.567
I want you,
Mr. McFarland,

10:00.667 --> 10:04.037
to cast it into
proper legal shape.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.974
I shall sit here
while you do so.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.782
You can understand my
astonishment, Mr. Holmes,

10:15.883 --> 10:19.419
when I found that, with
some minor reservations,

10:19.553 --> 10:23.590
his entire estate
had been left to me.

10:23.724 --> 10:27.394
"But I ... I simply
don't understand.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.197
Well, then,
let me explain.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.500
I'm a bachelor,
Mr. McFarland,

10:33.600 --> 10:34.835
with few relatives,

10:34.935 --> 10:37.471
and none who deserve
my consideration.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.072
Well, that may
well be so ...

10:39.206 --> 10:40.974
Let me ...
let me finish.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.509
I beg your pardon.

10:42.609 --> 10:46.747
For many years now, I've
withdrawn from my business.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.683
I was a builder, and
though I say it myself,

10:49.783 --> 10:52.019
an extremely
successful one.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.755
Successful enough to have
gained considerable wealth

10:54.855 --> 10:57.224
and thus live out
my life in complete,

10:57.324 --> 10:59.259
if solitary,
comfort.

11:05.499 --> 11:09.436
Many years ago,
I knew your mother.

11:09.536 --> 11:12.439
Knew her,
and hoped to marry her.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.442
Then she met and
married your father.

11:15.542 --> 11:18.579
I had no idea.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.381
Well,
and why should you?

11:21.481 --> 11:23.450
Three months ago, why,

11:23.550 --> 11:25.219
I read of your
father's death

11:25.319 --> 11:26.453
in The Daily Telegraph,

11:26.553 --> 11:29.223
and my mind was turned
to your mother

11:29.323 --> 11:32.993
and to the son who might
very well have been my own.

11:33.093 --> 11:38.999
This is my way of
securing your future.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.934
I know that
whatever I leave

11:41.034 --> 11:42.503
will be in worthy hands.

11:42.636 --> 11:47.608
What can I say,
but thank you?

11:47.741 --> 11:50.010
There are a few documents
I think you should see ...

11:50.110 --> 11:51.645
building leases,
title deeds,

11:51.778 --> 11:53.347
mortgages and so on.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.452
Well, now my
mind's made up,

11:58.552 --> 12:00.854
I shan't rest easy until
the whole thing's settled.

12:00.954 --> 12:01.855
Yes, of course.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.957
I beg you to come
to my house tonight.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.792
What shall we say,
9 o'clock?

12:05.893 --> 12:06.627
Why, yes.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.195
You'll of course bring
the finalized Will,

12:08.295 --> 12:09.730
and then we can settle the
matter once and for all.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.664
Yes, of course.

12:10.764 --> 12:11.632
Thank you,
my boy.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.036
Oh, one last thing.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.938
Not a word of this
to your dear mother

12:18.038 --> 12:19.673
until everything
is settled.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.775
I want it to be a little
surprised for her.

12:21.909 --> 12:22.843
Little, I ...

12:22.943 --> 12:24.244
You ...
you promise?

12:24.344 --> 12:25.979
You have my word.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.500
I left in good time
for my appointment,

12:46.633 --> 12:48.869
but had difficulty
in finding the house,

12:48.969 --> 12:52.639
so that it was nearly half-past
before I reached it.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.308
Good evening.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.476
I have an appointment
with Mr. Oldacre.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.412
Mr. McFarland?

12:58.512 --> 13:00.981
Yes, that's right.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.789
It was not the warmest
of receptions.

13:08.889 --> 13:13.093
And the house itself had a
peculiar, unloved feeling.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.001
Sorry to keep you
waiting, my boy.

13:21.101 --> 13:21.935
Not at all, sir.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.337
I'm a little late,
I'm afraid.

13:23.437 --> 13:24.505
Now, you brought
the papers?

13:24.638 --> 13:25.205
Yes, indeed.

13:25.339 --> 13:26.540
Excellent.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.110
The bedroom was on
the ground floor

13:30.244 --> 13:31.678
where there was
a large safe.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.490
"Bring the rest of
those papers, my boy.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.708
Now, to business.

14:25.666 --> 14:26.867
All done?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.836
Yes, sir,
all done.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.704
Just seen the time,
my boy.

14:30.804 --> 14:31.805
You must get home.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.207
Oh, thank you.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.775
I had a stick with me.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.243
Ah, I wonder where
she put it?

14:36.343 --> 14:37.644
A rather heavy
walking stick.

14:37.744 --> 14:38.679
It belonged
to my father.

14:38.779 --> 14:41.148
Ah, never mind, I'll take
good care of it until we meet again.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.051
After all, I shall be seeing
a great deal of you now, I hope.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.385
Indeed you shall, sir.

14:47.421 --> 14:48.956
I left him there.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.491
The safe was open,

14:50.591 --> 14:53.093
and the documents
were on his desk.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.429
It was too late to go
back to Blackheath,

14:55.529 --> 14:58.198
and so I spent the night
at a hotel in Norwood.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.168
I knew nothing more of
this horrible affair

15:01.268 --> 15:03.237
until this morning.

15:10.544 --> 15:13.580
Do you have the original
draft of the Will

15:13.714 --> 15:15.249
that Oldacre
brought to you?

15:15.382 --> 15:17.784
Why, yes, I ...
I have it here.

15:22.623 --> 15:25.926
May I retain this for
24 hours, Inspector?

15:26.026 --> 15:28.262
It would amuse you.

15:28.362 --> 15:33.233
Well, anything more you'd
like to ask, Mr. Holmes?

15:33.333 --> 15:35.502
Not until I've
been to Blackheath.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.337
You mean Norwood?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.107
No doubt, that is what
I must have meant.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.909
Now, Mr. McFarland,

15:42.009 --> 15:43.810
my Constable's
at the door,

15:43.911 --> 15:45.345
there's a
four-wheeler waiting.

15:54.922 --> 15:56.023
Morning, gentlemen.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.224
Morning.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.713
There are certain points
about this document,

16:52.846 --> 16:54.681
are there not Watson?

16:59.620 --> 17:03.590
Well, I can read
the first two lines

17:03.724 --> 17:06.393
and these in the middle
of the second page

17:06.492 --> 17:08.127
and one or
two at the end,

17:08.228 --> 17:09.997
I mean, they're as clear
as print.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.566
But the writing in
between is very bad,

17:12.665 --> 17:15.135
and there's several places
where I can't read it at all.

17:15.269 --> 17:16.737
What do make
of that?

17:16.837 --> 17:20.007
What do
you make of it?

17:20.107 --> 17:22.376
That it was written
on the train.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.944
The good writing
represents stations,

17:25.045 --> 17:29.650
the bad writing movement,
and the very bad writing ...

17:29.750 --> 17:32.052
Passing over
the points?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.454
A scientific expert
would pronounce at once

17:34.555 --> 17:37.124
that it was drawn up
on a suburban line.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.358
Since nowhere,

17:38.492 --> 17:40.828
save in the immediate
vicinity of a great city,

17:40.928 --> 17:44.298
could there be so quick
a succession of points.

17:44.398 --> 17:47.301
Granting that
his whole journey

17:47.401 --> 17:50.337
was occupied in
drawing up the Will,

17:50.437 --> 17:53.907
then the train must
have been an express,

17:54.041 --> 17:58.312
stopping only once between
Norwood and London Bridge.

17:58.412 --> 18:00.481
Yes, but it's curious,
is it not,

18:00.614 --> 18:04.017
that a man should draw up
so important a document

18:04.117 --> 18:06.353
in so haphazard
a fashion?

18:06.453 --> 18:09.389
And it suggests
that he thought

18:09.490 --> 18:11.992
it was going to be of no
practical importance.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.195
Well, he drew up his death
warrant at the same time.

18:21.835 --> 18:25.005
This case is not
clear to me.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.774
Come, Watson!

18:34.414 --> 18:36.116
Where are we going,
Norwood?

18:36.216 --> 18:38.285
No, Blackheath.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.453
Come!

18:59.907 --> 19:03.210
My son's the gentlest
creature on God's earth.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.046
It's inconceivable he
could even contemplate

19:06.146 --> 19:08.315
such a terrible crime.

19:08.415 --> 19:12.452
He didn't even know
the man, Mr. Holmes.

19:12.586 --> 19:15.556
But you did,
Mrs. McFarland.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.769
Years ago.

19:28.869 --> 19:31.205
I'd forgotten that
he ever existed.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.012
I tried to forget.

19:39.146 --> 19:41.215
It's impossible
to quite forget

19:41.348 --> 19:43.484
a man like
Jonas Oldacre.

19:43.584 --> 19:46.854
Yes, I knew him well.

19:46.954 --> 19:51.625
At one time, we were
engaged to be married.

19:57.164 --> 19:59.199
Thank heaven I had the
sense to turn away from him

19:59.333 --> 20:02.636
and marry a better,
if poorer, man.

20:02.736 --> 20:06.707
Oh, please.

20:13.547 --> 20:18.118
Your husband
died recently?

20:21.822 --> 20:26.360
He was a kind man,
gentle man.

20:26.493 --> 20:29.296
He was everything
Jonas Oldacre was not.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.933
And yet, at one time,
you were prepared to marry him?

20:36.103 --> 20:38.806
I said that I
knew him well,

20:38.906 --> 20:40.274
but the more
I knew of him,

20:40.374 --> 20:42.342
the more I came
to realize

20:42.442 --> 20:45.179
I knew him
not at all.

20:45.279 --> 20:52.152
He would change suddenly,
would also frighten me.

20:52.252 --> 20:56.757
There was a dark side to
his character, Mr. Holmes.

20:56.890 --> 21:00.160
A desire
to cause pain.

21:19.613 --> 21:21.882
My own photograph.

21:21.982 --> 21:25.953
It was my first
present to him.

21:26.086 --> 21:29.223
Good heavens!

21:29.323 --> 21:31.325
That was how
it was returned to me

21:31.458 --> 21:33.293
on my wedding day,

21:33.393 --> 21:35.896
together with
a vile note

21:36.029 --> 21:38.332
urging a curse
upon my house

21:38.432 --> 21:40.734
and saying he'd
never forgive me.

21:40.834 --> 21:43.637
And yet, he does seem
to have forgiven you ...

21:43.737 --> 21:46.773
after all, to leave his
entire estate to your son.

21:46.907 --> 21:48.442
Neither my son
nor I want anything

21:48.575 --> 21:51.078
from that wicked man,
dead or alive.

21:51.211 --> 21:55.215
Mrs. McFarland,
the fact remains

21:55.349 --> 21:57.684
that the
Will was made.

22:02.723 --> 22:04.992
I simply
can't understand it.

22:08.061 --> 22:09.129
Why?

22:09.263 --> 22:12.099
Had you ever spoken of
Oldacre to your son?

22:12.199 --> 22:15.002
I mean, perhaps told him
what you've just told me now?

22:16.837 --> 22:17.938
No, never.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.940
Never?

22:26.113 --> 22:28.315
He found
the photograph.

22:33.387 --> 22:35.455
My husband tried
to make light of it,

22:35.589 --> 22:38.058
but he insisted.

22:38.192 --> 22:42.930
My husband told him something
of the truth, that's all.

22:43.030 --> 22:48.168
And the boy
was disturbed?

22:48.268 --> 22:50.771
He was upset,
naturally.

22:50.904 --> 22:54.074
You see, Mrs. McFarland,
what the police might say is,

22:54.174 --> 23:00.781
that he had heard of
Oldacre's behavior toward you.

23:00.881 --> 23:04.651
It would pre-dispose him
toward hatred and violence.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.286
And so that case
against him would be

23:06.420 --> 23:08.622
considerably strengthened.

23:08.722 --> 23:10.324
No.

23:10.457 --> 23:13.327
There is a God in
heaven, Mr. Holmes,

23:13.427 --> 23:15.829
and that same God who's
punished that wicked man

23:15.929 --> 23:17.898
will show in his
own good time,

23:17.998 --> 23:20.534
my son's hands are
guiltless of his blood.

23:35.449 --> 23:36.783
Wait here, please.

23:44.591 --> 23:48.462
Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson.

23:48.562 --> 23:50.430
We're just clearing up.

23:50.531 --> 23:52.499
The Will as promised.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.673
Look, buttons!

23:59.773 --> 24:01.642
Trouser buttons.

24:01.742 --> 24:04.411
No doubt, you've brought
your glass with you?

24:04.511 --> 24:08.182
The name is Hiams.

24:08.282 --> 24:11.185
According to Mrs. Lexington,
the housekeeper, Hiams,

24:11.285 --> 24:13.620
is the name of
Mr. Oldacre's tailor.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.523
Presumably, the
organic remains

24:16.623 --> 24:19.193
have been removed
to the laboratory?

24:19.326 --> 24:20.694
They have, Doctor,

24:20.794 --> 24:23.163
though they'll be of
little use, I suspect.

24:23.263 --> 24:25.699
The poor devil was no
more than bone and cinder.

24:25.799 --> 24:28.268
How very convenient
for the murderer.

24:28.368 --> 24:30.771
Not, I might venture,
for Mr. Oldacre.

24:30.871 --> 24:34.208
Nevertheless, Inspector,
bones cinder.

24:34.308 --> 24:36.677
Thank heavens, he was
wearing his trousers.

24:43.517 --> 24:45.319
This stick belongs
to the accused,

24:45.419 --> 24:47.354
and he's never
denied it.

24:47.454 --> 24:48.922
He says that he
could not find it

24:49.056 --> 24:50.457
when he came to
leave the house.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.726
Says, Mr. Holmes, says.

24:52.826 --> 24:55.162
My experts made
out footmarks

24:55.262 --> 24:58.098
of both men
on the carpet.

25:03.637 --> 25:05.205
And too much
subsequent traffic

25:05.339 --> 25:08.008
to make any examination
on my part worthwhile.

25:08.108 --> 25:10.577
Two sets of footmarks,
Mr. Holmes.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.746
None of any
third person.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.716
Another trick
for your side.

25:15.816 --> 25:18.285
I suppose all these
papers are from the safe?

25:18.418 --> 25:19.686
Correct.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.321
And nothing,
absolutely nothing,

25:21.455 --> 25:22.523
has been removed?

25:22.656 --> 25:23.991
Nothing whatsoever.

25:24.091 --> 25:25.792
We have opened one or two,
as you can see,

25:25.893 --> 25:27.561
to check the contents.

25:27.661 --> 25:29.429
May I check them?

25:29.530 --> 25:31.832
By all means.

25:31.932 --> 25:34.802
I, myself, have
business at The Yard.

25:34.902 --> 25:37.070
Oh, and I would like to
see the housekeeper ...

25:37.171 --> 25:38.138
what is her name?

25:38.272 --> 25:39.740
Mrs. Lexington.

25:39.840 --> 25:43.076
She'll add nothing more
to what you already know.

25:43.177 --> 25:45.979
Nevertheless.

25:46.079 --> 25:47.314
I'll send her in.

25:53.654 --> 25:56.023
Could it be
that for once

25:56.123 --> 25:58.392
Le Strade is on
the right track?

26:01.195 --> 26:02.596
All my instincts
are one way,

26:02.696 --> 26:04.398
and all the facts
are the other.

26:10.437 --> 26:11.905
You wish
to see me, sir?

26:12.039 --> 26:13.674
Yes.

26:13.774 --> 26:14.975
Mrs. Lexington, this is
my friend and colleague,

26:15.075 --> 26:16.443
Dr. Watson.

26:16.543 --> 26:19.313
Do sit down.

26:19.413 --> 26:21.215
I'll stand,
if I may.

26:21.315 --> 26:24.284
This room has no
comfort for me.

26:29.857 --> 26:33.126
You let young Mr. McFarland
into this house at 9:30?

26:33.227 --> 26:34.428
Yes.

26:34.528 --> 26:37.531
I wish that my hand had
withered before I'd done so.

26:37.664 --> 26:40.634
And you retired
to bed at?

26:40.767 --> 26:42.803
20 minutes
past 11:00.

26:42.936 --> 26:47.374
20 minutes
past 11:00.

26:47.508 --> 26:50.244
And you
heard nothing?

26:50.344 --> 26:52.713
My room is at
the far end of the house.

26:52.813 --> 26:55.349
I heard nothing until
the fire alarm sounded.

26:55.482 --> 26:57.751
It was then,
only then,

26:57.851 --> 27:00.954
that I realized my poor
master had been murdered.

27:01.088 --> 27:03.957
Mrs. Lexington,
to your knowledge,

27:04.057 --> 27:07.628
did your master
have any enemies?

27:07.761 --> 27:10.197
Every man has
his enemies.

27:10.297 --> 27:13.000
And a businessman
like Mr. Oldacre,

27:13.100 --> 27:14.368
more than most,
perhaps?

27:14.468 --> 27:15.969
He was a well-respected
gentleman

27:16.103 --> 27:18.172
who kept himself very
much to himself.

27:22.442 --> 27:24.411
Do you know anything
about these papers?

27:24.545 --> 27:25.445
I know nothing

27:25.546 --> 27:27.080
of Mr. Oldacre's
private affairs.

27:27.214 --> 27:29.716
The buttons that the police
found in the fire?

27:29.850 --> 27:32.553
My master had three suits
made by Mr. Hiams ...

27:32.653 --> 27:34.388
two are still in that
wardrobe there,

27:34.488 --> 27:36.390
and the third he
was wearing that night.

27:36.490 --> 27:38.025
Thank you,
Mrs. Lexington,

27:38.158 --> 27:40.394
you have been most
cooperative.

27:49.369 --> 27:51.138
What do
you make of her?

27:51.238 --> 27:53.440
Tight as wax,
if you ask me,

27:53.540 --> 27:56.009
but then, perhaps that's
her usual manner?

27:56.143 --> 28:00.414
It's all wrong,
I feel it in my bones,

28:00.514 --> 28:07.955
something ... something
has not come out,

28:08.088 --> 28:09.389
and that woman
knows it.

28:12.226 --> 28:16.230
Holmes, would you like me
to have a look at these papers?

28:17.698 --> 28:19.399
Well, a man's bank
account can tell us

28:19.500 --> 28:21.368
as much
as his diary.

28:21.468 --> 28:23.470
Correct.

28:23.604 --> 28:26.106
Thank you, Watson.

28:40.254 --> 28:41.588
It's all right
Constable,

28:41.688 --> 28:43.524
I'm just
stretching my legs.

28:43.624 --> 28:45.392
I'll watch them.

30:27.995 --> 30:29.329
Ah, Constable.

30:34.034 --> 30:35.369
Are you a local man?

30:35.469 --> 30:38.272
Born on Bridge, sir,
not a half-mile from here.

30:38.372 --> 30:39.807
Excellent.

30:39.907 --> 30:43.177
Then perhaps you can offer
me some local knowledge?

30:43.277 --> 30:44.478
I'll do my best,
sir,

30:44.578 --> 30:46.313
I'll most certainly
do my best.

30:59.793 --> 31:00.794
Holmes!

31:05.065 --> 31:08.368
Le Strade did say that no
documents had been removed?

31:08.469 --> 31:09.670
Yes.

31:09.770 --> 31:10.804
That's what
I thought.

31:10.938 --> 31:12.005
You've found
something?

31:12.139 --> 31:14.041
No, it's what I haven't
found that interests me.

31:14.141 --> 31:15.742
There are certain
cross-references

31:15.876 --> 31:18.111
to various deeds,
valuable deeds,

31:18.212 --> 31:20.147
none of which
I can find.

31:24.384 --> 31:25.986
But one thing
is clear:

31:26.119 --> 31:27.221
Oldacre was hardly

31:27.354 --> 31:28.922
in the affluent
circumstances

31:29.056 --> 31:30.491
we have been led
to believe.

31:30.591 --> 31:32.159
His bank account was
practically empty,

31:32.292 --> 31:34.261
largely because he had made
several large payments

31:34.394 --> 31:37.364
in the past year
to a certain Mr. Cornelius.

31:40.334 --> 31:43.036
Young McFarland would
have inherited nothing.

31:43.137 --> 31:44.605
This is of interest.

31:44.705 --> 31:46.773
Why should a
retired builder

31:46.907 --> 31:49.710
have such large transactions
with a Mr. Cornelius?

31:49.810 --> 31:51.778
Well, let's take
our cab,

31:51.912 --> 31:54.414
and see what we can find
out from his city bank.

31:54.548 --> 31:56.216
You coming?

31:56.316 --> 31:58.051
I'll stay here
for awhile.

31:59.786 --> 32:01.021
Norwood Station.

32:12.933 --> 32:14.802
So, you're not
going back to London

32:14.902 --> 32:16.503
with your friend,
then?

32:16.637 --> 32:18.338
No, not yet,
anyway.

32:18.438 --> 32:21.041
I do hope my presence
doesn't inconvenience you.

32:21.175 --> 32:23.143
By the way,
I should warn you,

32:23.243 --> 32:26.513
I found an undesirable
lurking about by the gates.

32:26.613 --> 32:27.481
I saw him on ...

32:27.581 --> 32:28.615
An undesirable?

32:28.749 --> 32:30.184
A tramp,
Mrs. Lexington,

32:30.284 --> 32:32.252
a gentlemen
of the road.

32:32.386 --> 32:34.354
He will get
nothing here.

32:34.454 --> 32:36.824
Ah, you don't
believe in

32:36.924 --> 32:39.493
supporting our less
fortunate brethren?

32:39.626 --> 32:42.563
I work,
so can they.

32:42.663 --> 32:43.997
Quite so.

33:36.517 --> 33:39.086
I'm on my way
to Croxton.

33:43.090 --> 33:45.425
I've done enough walking,
I have...

33:45.526 --> 33:47.861
To all kinds
of places.

33:47.961 --> 33:49.229
I'll stay put.

33:53.567 --> 33:55.803
I used to meet
a friend of mine here.

33:55.903 --> 34:00.073
Oh, you might know him,
he's a seafaring man.

34:00.174 --> 34:05.145
Aha, I know him.

34:05.279 --> 34:09.817
Shared my billet for the
last four nights, he does.

34:09.949 --> 34:14.521
And off he goes,
without even a word.

34:14.655 --> 34:18.759
You take my tip.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.694
Stay clear of him.

34:20.793 --> 34:23.764
He's a liar.

34:23.897 --> 34:27.201
He didn't strike
me as such.

34:27.301 --> 34:30.103
He goes up to that
big house, he does.

34:30.204 --> 34:34.174
He comes back here
and tells some yarn

34:34.308 --> 34:37.844
about him putting out
with old mans,

34:37.978 --> 34:40.681
and telling him
to come back tomorrow

34:40.781 --> 34:42.282
and they'll
give him some grub

34:42.416 --> 34:44.885
and some
cast-offs for him.

34:45.018 --> 34:46.553
Well,
how is that lying?

34:48.989 --> 34:51.358
Because,
my friend,

34:51.458 --> 34:54.828
I already paid
my call.

34:54.928 --> 34:56.763
I nearly got my
lord on my back

34:56.864 --> 34:58.465
for my insolence ...

34:58.599 --> 35:00.567
insolence.

35:08.108 --> 35:10.077
Perhaps he told you
a pleasing tale.

35:13.647 --> 35:15.916
Are you saying,

35:16.016 --> 35:18.485
that a drunken
sailor has more to offer

35:18.585 --> 35:22.256
than a Sergeant
in the 22nd?

35:22.356 --> 35:24.758
No, no.

35:24.858 --> 35:27.795
He's a liar.

35:27.895 --> 35:35.102
He says, "Whatever I get,"
he says,

35:35.202 --> 35:39.106
"I'll share with you,
shipmate, " he says.

35:39.206 --> 35:42.176
Off he goes.

35:42.309 --> 35:45.512
Not a sight
of him since.

37:00.053 --> 37:01.989
Holmes,

37:08.962 --> 37:12.699
you must permit
yourself some food.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.301
You must eat.

37:14.434 --> 37:17.171
A present, I cannot
afford energy

37:17.271 --> 37:20.040
and nerve force
for digestion.

37:20.140 --> 37:24.411
Well, you must if you
intend to pursue this case.

37:24.511 --> 37:26.213
I feel,
my dear fellow,

37:26.313 --> 37:27.981
that our case will
end ingloriously

37:28.081 --> 37:30.584
by Le Strade
hanging our client,

37:30.717 --> 37:35.456
which will certainly be a
triumph for Scotland Yard.

37:35.556 --> 37:37.925
There's a telegram.

37:51.271 --> 37:53.373
"Important
fresh evidence at hand,

37:53.507 --> 37:55.776
McFarland's guilt
definitely established,

37:55.876 --> 37:59.313
advise you to abandon
case, Le Strade."

37:59.446 --> 38:04.118
It is Le Strade's little
cockle-doodle of victory.

38:35.349 --> 38:37.918
Let's have
some breakfast,

38:41.855 --> 38:45.826
and then go out together
and see what we can do.

38:48.595 --> 38:51.198
I feel as if I shall
need your company

38:51.331 --> 38:52.733
and moral
support today.

39:04.845 --> 39:08.248
Ah, Mr. Holmes,
Dr. Watson.

39:08.348 --> 39:09.917
I think you will
acknowledge

39:10.050 --> 39:12.986
that we're just a little
in front of you this time.

39:16.590 --> 39:19.059
Step this way, if you
please, gentlemen,

39:19.159 --> 39:21.428
and I'm sure
I can convince you

39:21.528 --> 39:23.497
that it was
John McFarland

39:23.597 --> 39:25.165
who committed
this crime.

39:25.299 --> 39:28.702
I don't like being wrong any
more than the rest of us do.

39:28.802 --> 39:30.370
Still, a man
can't always

39:30.504 --> 39:32.806
expect to have it
his own way,

39:32.906 --> 39:34.708
can he Dr. Watson?

39:45.652 --> 39:47.488
This is where the
housekeeper left

39:47.588 --> 39:49.022
McFarland's hat
and stick,

39:49.123 --> 39:50.891
and this is also where
he would have come

39:50.991 --> 39:53.660
to collect his hat after
the crime was committed.

39:53.794 --> 39:56.396
Now, look at this.

39:56.530 --> 39:58.632
A thumb mark.

39:58.765 --> 39:59.967
So I observe.

40:00.067 --> 40:02.136
A thumb mark
in blood.

40:02.269 --> 40:04.838
You are aware that no two
thumb marks are alike?

40:04.972 --> 40:07.274
I have heard
something of the kind.

40:22.022 --> 40:23.624
Identical.

40:23.757 --> 40:26.727
And that was taken from
McFarland this morning.

40:28.796 --> 40:30.731
Definitely the same
thumb mark.

40:30.831 --> 40:32.800
And that is final.

40:32.900 --> 40:36.670
Quite final.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.839
Who made this
discovery?

40:38.972 --> 40:40.808
It was
Mrs. Lexington here

40:40.908 --> 40:43.377
who drew my Constable's
attention to it.

40:44.745 --> 40:45.879
And, I suppose,

40:46.013 --> 40:48.549
there is no doubt that the
mark was there yesterday?

40:48.682 --> 40:50.617
Well, of course McFarland
could have crept out

40:50.717 --> 40:52.553
of jail in the middle
of the night

40:52.653 --> 40:54.922
just to strengthen the
evidence against himself.

40:55.022 --> 40:56.490
Ha-ha.

40:56.623 --> 41:00.127
Have you any objection
if I take a stroll upstairs?

41:00.127 --> 41:01.995
No, none at all.

41:02.095 --> 41:04.731
There's nothing
up there, though.

42:15.936 --> 42:18.272
So many things
look so bad, Holmes.

42:18.372 --> 42:24.111
But there is a serious
flaw in this new evidence.

42:24.211 --> 42:26.246
What's that?

42:26.380 --> 42:29.349
That thumb print
was not there

42:29.483 --> 42:31.852
when I examined
the hall yesterday.

42:45.966 --> 42:47.534
Inspector Le Strade,

42:47.668 --> 42:51.371
I cannot help thinking your
evidence is incomplete.

42:51.472 --> 42:54.308
What do you mean,
Mr. Holmes?

42:54.408 --> 42:56.043
Merely that there is
an important witness

42:56.176 --> 42:57.811
that you have
not yet seen.

42:57.945 --> 43:00.147
You can produce this
witness, can you?

43:00.147 --> 43:01.582
I think I can.

43:01.682 --> 43:03.050
Well then, do so.

43:03.150 --> 43:04.918
I'll do my best.

43:05.018 --> 43:07.321
How many
Constables have you?

43:07.421 --> 43:08.889
Three within call.

43:08.989 --> 43:10.324
Excellent.

43:10.424 --> 43:12.793
I assume that they
are able-bodied,

43:12.893 --> 43:14.995
large men with
powerful voices?

43:15.129 --> 43:19.566
No doubt that they are,
yeah.

43:19.666 --> 43:22.636
In the outhouse, there
is a quantity of straw.

43:22.769 --> 43:24.805
I would like two
bundles brought in.

43:24.938 --> 43:26.740
Straw?

43:29.777 --> 43:31.879
And two buckets
of water.

43:32.012 --> 43:33.981
Water?

43:34.114 --> 43:36.283
Ask them to bring it
to the top landing.

43:46.760 --> 43:49.129
Straw, into the fireplace,
a little bit in front.

43:49.229 --> 43:52.599
Two buckets of water to
that side, Constable.

43:52.699 --> 43:54.668
Mr. Holmes!

43:54.802 --> 43:57.304
I don't know whether you're
playing a game with us,

43:57.437 --> 44:00.340
but surely tell us without
all this tom-foolery.

44:00.441 --> 44:02.142
I can assure you,
Le Strade,

44:02.242 --> 44:04.211
I have an excellent reason
for everything that I do.

44:04.344 --> 44:06.580
Watson, would you put
a match to that straw?

44:06.680 --> 44:09.149
And Constable, will you
sprinkle it with water?

44:29.102 --> 44:31.805
Now, we must see

44:31.905 --> 44:36.643
if we can find this witness
for you, Le Strade.

44:36.743 --> 44:39.279
Gentlemen,

44:39.413 --> 44:46.386
would you please join me
and we'll call a fire ...

44:46.520 --> 44:48.455
one, two three ...
FIRE!

44:48.555 --> 44:49.490
Fire.

44:49.590 --> 44:51.525
We can do better
than that.

44:51.625 --> 44:54.027
Full voice,
and together.

44:54.128 --> 44:55.496
FIRE!

45:08.742 --> 45:10.043
Good heavens,

45:10.144 --> 45:15.315
Constable, a bucket of
water on that straw.

45:15.415 --> 45:17.317
Le Strade, allow me
to present you

45:17.417 --> 45:20.988
with your missing principal
witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre.

45:21.121 --> 45:23.791
What's this then?

45:23.924 --> 45:26.527
What have you been
doing all this time?

45:26.660 --> 45:28.295
I've done no harm.

45:28.428 --> 45:29.830
NO harm!

45:29.930 --> 45:31.298
You've only
done your best

45:31.398 --> 45:33.300
to get an innocent
man hanged.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.636
If it wasn't for this
gentleman standing here,

45:35.736 --> 45:38.172
I'm not sure you
wouldn't have succeeded.

45:38.272 --> 45:39.873
Take him!

45:40.007 --> 45:44.278
Let us see where this
rat has been lurking.

45:50.784 --> 45:52.586
Now you see the advantage
of being a builder,

45:52.686 --> 45:55.022
he was able to fix up his
own little hiding place

45:55.122 --> 45:56.757
without any
confederate,

45:56.890 --> 45:58.859
save for that precious housekeeper of his,

45:58.992 --> 46:01.895
whom I should lose no time in
adding to your bag, Inspector.

46:01.995 --> 46:04.798
And these are the missing
papers, no doubt?

46:04.898 --> 46:06.867
No doubt
whatsoever.

46:06.967 --> 46:09.203
Constable, find
the housekeeper.

46:09.303 --> 46:11.772
How did you know about
that place, Mr. Holmes?

46:11.872 --> 46:13.907
When I compared the
proportions of this room

46:14.041 --> 46:15.909
with those
of the room below,

46:16.009 --> 46:19.246
I deduced that this
fireplace wall was false.

46:19.346 --> 46:22.316
Oldacre clearly had a
great deal of nerve,

46:22.416 --> 46:24.251
but little enough,
I've found,

46:24.351 --> 46:26.120
to like quiet before
an alarm of fire.

46:33.494 --> 46:34.461
How in the world
did you know

46:34.595 --> 46:35.662
that he was in
the house at all?

46:35.796 --> 46:37.064
The thumb mark,
Le Strade.

46:37.164 --> 46:38.966
When I examined the hall
yesterday, it was clear.

46:39.066 --> 46:40.834
Therefore, it must have been
put there during the night.

46:40.934 --> 46:42.035
But how?

46:42.169 --> 46:46.540
After McFarland had examined
the papers that night,

46:46.640 --> 46:48.041
he resealed them.

46:48.142 --> 46:50.611
To do so, he used his
thumb upon the wax.

46:50.711 --> 46:53.147
Brooding in that
den of his,

46:53.247 --> 46:55.282
it suddenly
struck Oldacre

46:55.415 --> 46:57.851
what use he could make
of that thumbprint.

46:57.951 --> 47:00.454
Smearing the wax
with a little blood,

47:00.587 --> 47:02.656
he made what appeared
to be absolutely

47:02.790 --> 47:05.392
damning evidence
against McFarland.

47:05.526 --> 47:09.696
But what was the object
of his deception?

47:09.830 --> 47:11.331
Ah, well,
you see Inspector,

47:11.465 --> 47:13.167
in order to swindle
his creditors,

47:13.267 --> 47:15.002
who were
pressing him,

47:15.102 --> 47:17.404
Oldacre emptied his bank
account by paying out

47:17.504 --> 47:20.140
several large sums to a
certain Mr. Cornelius.

47:20.274 --> 47:22.042
Now, I have no doubt
that Messers Oldacre

47:22.142 --> 47:24.111
and Cornelius are one
and the same person,

47:24.211 --> 47:26.713
the object being
to change his name,

47:26.847 --> 47:29.349
draw on the money,
and then vanish.

47:29.483 --> 47:32.052
We see before us
a very deep,

47:32.186 --> 47:34.655
malicious and
vindictive man.

47:34.755 --> 47:36.323
Did you know that he
was once refused

47:36.457 --> 47:38.759
by McFarland's mother?

47:38.859 --> 47:41.762
All his life, he has
longed for vengeance.

47:41.862 --> 47:43.564
If he could give
the impression

47:43.664 --> 47:44.765
that he
was murdered

47:44.898 --> 47:46.867
by the only child of his
former sweetheart,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.169
what more
better revenge?

47:49.303 --> 47:51.472
I would never have
allowed any real harm

47:51.605 --> 47:53.073
to befall poor
Mr. McFarland,

47:53.173 --> 47:54.041
I assure you.

47:54.141 --> 47:55.909
That's for the jury
to decide.

47:56.009 --> 47:58.078
You're charging me?

47:58.212 --> 47:59.379
For a joke?

47:59.513 --> 48:01.081
It's nothing more
than a practical joke.

48:01.215 --> 48:02.983
It's nothing less
than murder ...

48:03.083 --> 48:05.452
the body in the fire.

48:05.552 --> 48:09.990
But whose body was it?

48:10.090 --> 48:11.859
And old sailor,
Le Strade,

48:11.959 --> 48:14.061
who had fallen upon
hard times.

48:14.194 --> 48:16.096
When I examined the
ashes of that fire,

48:16.196 --> 48:22.136
I discovered that your
experts had missed this.

48:22.236 --> 48:27.875
It is a tooth of the
great white shark,

48:28.008 --> 48:31.211
and you see that it has
been lightly carved.

48:31.311 --> 48:34.448
It is typical of the work
carried out by seamen.

48:34.581 --> 48:37.384
Well, this isn't
evidence enough

48:37.484 --> 48:39.419
to show who
died in the fire.

48:42.256 --> 48:44.191
I know for certain
that on Monday,

48:44.291 --> 48:45.659
the day before
the murder,

48:45.759 --> 48:48.095
a tramp called
at this house.

48:48.195 --> 48:51.198
Yet, when I questioned
the housekeeper,

48:51.331 --> 48:52.199
she assured me

48:52.299 --> 48:54.768
that no such tramp
would ever be welcome.

48:54.902 --> 48:57.838
Not only was his
reception welcoming,

48:57.938 --> 49:00.674
but the man received some
of Oldacre's clothing.

49:00.774 --> 49:03.777
Yesterday,
near the front gate,

49:03.911 --> 49:06.580
I found the calling
card that he left,

49:06.713 --> 49:09.483
a coded sign advising
his fellow travelers

49:09.583 --> 49:11.718
of a charitable welcome.

49:11.852 --> 49:12.453
And last night,

49:12.586 --> 49:14.221
with the help of your
local Constable,

49:14.354 --> 49:18.325
I talked to one of these
fellow travelers,

49:18.459 --> 49:20.327
who said that
the unfortunate seaman

49:20.427 --> 49:22.896
had been asked to call
back the following day

49:22.996 --> 49:25.666
with the assurance of
further hospitality.

49:25.799 --> 49:29.603
And so,
the next morning,

49:29.703 --> 49:32.172
wearing his
new clothes,

49:32.272 --> 49:36.710
or at least his new
trousers, he returned ...

49:36.844 --> 49:39.346
and was never
seen again.

49:39.480 --> 49:42.883
You've saved an innocent
man's life, Mr. Holmes.

49:42.983 --> 49:46.487
You've also saved me
some embarrassment.

49:46.620 --> 49:49.423
Ah, my good chap!

49:49.523 --> 49:51.125
You will find that
your reputation

49:51.258 --> 49:53.026
has been
enormously enhanced.

49:53.127 --> 49:54.995
Just make a few
alterations to that report

49:55.095 --> 49:56.463
which you
are writing,

49:56.563 --> 49:58.232
and they will understand
how hard it is

49:58.365 --> 50:00.534
to throw dust in the eyes
of Inspector Le Strade.

50:00.667 --> 50:02.703
You don't want your
name to appear?

50:05.839 --> 50:06.907
Not at all.

50:09.977 --> 50:12.613
His work
is its own reward.

50:12.746 --> 50:16.617
I'll see you
hang for this!

50:16.717 --> 50:19.153
That privilege must
surely be mine.
