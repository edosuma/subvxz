each other's lot in life,

one's date, spouse, life partner.

not some swank party.

like there's a process of development.

MITCHELL: Better than the junk
they peddle at the cafeteria, huh?

07:06.826 --> 07:08.657
You'd think she'd never eaten pie before.

That's an important skill.
Somebody's got to take care of the bills.

Yes, and Cameron's so terrible
with finances, so.

in all rooms of the house
at all times of the day,

07:55.241 --> 07:57.573
but, well, once we got a chance
to get to know each other,

07:57.677 --> 07:59.645
we formed a deeper connection.

07:59.745 --> 08:01.736
A spiritual bond, you might say.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.277
Well, I suppose
it's nice he found someone.

No, it's okay. I'll ask at the inquiry desk.

09:04.810 --> 09:08.075

in their rare-items archive.

left by cloaked cargo ship.

you had to completely disassemble

I'm going to have to say no.

- I'm a friend of the Colonel's.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.783
You still owe me a dance.

32:00.585 --> 32:04.681
Don't keep the lady waiting, Colonel.
You won't get another chance.

32:07.625 --> 32:10.025
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

32:23.508 --> 32:27.376
You sure your date won't mind us
spending time together like this?

32:27.478 --> 32:29.742
She's the independent type.

32:29.847 --> 32:31.212
Maybe too much so.

32:35.553 --> 32:37.180
You know what I like?

32:37.288 --> 32:41.748
Now that we're older, and hopefully wiser,
we can say how we really feel.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.722
There's none of that awful tension

32:43.828 --> 32:46.820
that used to hang in the air
when we were young.

32:46.931 --> 32:48.990
Yeah, I'm glad that's gone.

32:55.606 --> 32:56.698
(EX CLAIMS)

32:57.408 --> 33:00.343
- Oh, I like this.
- Oh, shut up.

33:03.281 --> 33:04.646
That's Odai Ventrell in there.

33:04.749 --> 33:06.182
- Who?
- No!

33:09.053 --> 33:13.319
Bounty hunter.
He's obviously here looking for me.

33:13.424 --> 33:15.619
Okay, no more liquor for you tonight,
all right?

33:15.727 --> 33:19.458
What? Oh, don't be ridiculous.
That stuff barely affects me.

33:20.365 --> 33:22.959
- Have you got any weapons on you?
- No!

33:25.603 --> 33:27.764
Then we'll have to improvise.

33:35.446 --> 33:39.746
- Hey, if you don't want to do this...
- No, it's not that. It's just...

33:41.853 --> 33:43.548
It's complicated.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.752
You don't have to say anything else.
I get the message.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.382
Vala, right?

33:53.364 --> 33:55.298
It's not what you think.

33:56.868 --> 34:00.531
Right now I need you to slap me,

34:00.638 --> 34:02.469
then get out of here.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.400
Dave "The Man" Nelson! It's Darrell!

34:07.045 --> 34:08.740
How you doing, man?

34:09.614 --> 34:11.605
- You're confusing me with someone else.
- What?

34:11.716 --> 34:13.809
Darrell, get the hell out of here.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.216
Oh, like I'm going to listen to you, huh?

34:16.320 --> 34:20.017
Making time with another girl,
leaving your date high and dry.

34:20.124 --> 34:23.025
Well, thank God I stepped up, huh, Dave?
Thank God!

34:23.127 --> 34:24.389
(SHOUTS)

34:24.996 --> 34:27.829
Touch me again and I'll kill you.

34:27.932 --> 34:30.127
Dave, you've changed, dude!

34:52.223 --> 34:53.520
Get back.

34:53.624 --> 34:55.387
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

35:09.240 --> 35:11.435
Your attention, please.

35:11.542 --> 35:14.102
Exiting this room is now impossible.

35:14.212 --> 35:17.272
Every door
has been magnetically sealed shut.

35:20.351 --> 35:23.582
Vala Mal Doran. This is my lucky day.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.225
Netan's offering a bonus
for anyone who bags you.

35:29.327 --> 35:31.852
Sorry. That didn't go well.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.295
Oh, it's worse than you think.

35:34.398 --> 35:38.061
Thanks to your little stunt,
now I start killing people.

35:38.936 --> 35:40.995
You don't have to do this.

35:41.472 --> 35:45.067
First rule of hostage taking,
always back up your threats.

35:45.943 --> 35:48.036
So, who's it going to be?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.807
The troublemaker?

35:52.250 --> 35:54.411
- Or the girlfriend?
- Cameron!

35:55.753 --> 35:57.482
Choose, Colonel, or they both die.

35:57.588 --> 36:00.523
Now, Ventrell,
you always were such a coward.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.052
I guess we'll start with you.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.391
<i>CARTER: This is Colonel Carter of SG-1.</i>

36:08.499 --> 36:11.434
<i>Once all the hostages have been released,</i>
<i>we are willing to beam in.</i>

36:11.536 --> 36:12.730
Negative.

36:12.837 --> 36:18.070
You and SG-1 beam in first, unarmed,
and then I'll let everyone go.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.944
(TRANSPORTER BEAMING)

36:27.985 --> 36:29.714
Over there, please.

36:31.656 --> 36:35.319
Colonel Mitchell, Vala,
would you mind joining the others?

36:39.263 --> 36:40.855
Turn around.

36:40.965 --> 36:42.364
So, what's your endgame, Ventrell?

36:42.466 --> 36:46.027
You know we're not just going
to let you walk out of here.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.866
Never planned on it.

37:10.161 --> 37:11.355
Hello.

37:16.968 --> 37:19.368
It's okay. You're all safe now.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.495
Yeah, but what happened to Vala?

37:24.442 --> 37:25.534
(ALL EX CLAIMING)

37:25.643 --> 37:27.235
Holy crap.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.582
I knew there was something wrong
with that woman.

37:32.883 --> 37:34.316
VALA: How did you do that?

37:34.418 --> 37:36.386
Oh! Allow me.

37:37.455 --> 37:40.515
We located this vessel in a field
several miles from here.

37:40.625 --> 37:43.423
We were onboard
trying to override the command code

37:43.527 --> 37:46.257
when it was remotely activated
and flown onto the roof of the school.

37:46.364 --> 37:49.492
That's right. You brought us to you.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.501
CARTER: After that, it was a simple matter
of activating Chimera.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.094
It's an Asgard holographic
projection system.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.605
It made it look like we'd beamed in.

37:56.707 --> 37:59.870
And you might've gotten away with it, too,
if it wasn't for us meddling kids.

37:59.977 --> 38:02.104
So much for your big payday.

38:03.314 --> 38:06.750
Well, I may not be able to collect,
but it doesn't mean others won't try.

38:06.851 --> 38:09.513
Unless there's a bigger payday
waiting somewhere else.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.554
What are you talking about?

38:11.656 --> 38:14.352
Oh, I've had some experience recently
dealing with the Lucian Alliance.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.824
I know for a fact
that some of Netan's seconds

38:16.927 --> 38:18.986
are starting to question his leadership.

38:19.096 --> 38:21.064
After this little fiasco,
it's only going to get worse.

38:21.165 --> 38:22.291
Indeed.

38:22.400 --> 38:27.861
With his failure to eliminate us yet again,
he will only appear weaker than before.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.940
MITCHELL: No doubt about it.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.599
There's blood in the water.

38:31.709 --> 38:36.442
Only question is, which enterprising shark
will be the first to take advantage of it?

39:12.717 --> 39:14.116
Well done.

39:14.752 --> 39:16.447
You saved my life.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.417
You'll be richly rewarded.

39:19.523 --> 39:23.050
I know I will. But not for saving you.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.364
Thank you.

39:31.001 --> 39:32.059
Vala!

39:32.169 --> 39:34.865
You sure you don't want some pie
for the road?

39:34.972 --> 39:37.873
- I couldn't possibly...
- It's your favorite.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.078
Thank you.

39:44.482 --> 39:47.679
Well, the General will probably blame me
if we miss our plane,

39:47.785 --> 39:50.151
so we probably should get moving.

39:50.755 --> 39:51.983
Cameron!

39:52.823 --> 39:54.450
We have to get moving.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.253
Go wait in the car!

40:00.831 --> 40:04.323
I exaggerated the spiritual bond thing
just a little.

40:04.435 --> 40:06.528
Yeah. Yeah, we got that.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.737
Thank you.

40:12.443 --> 40:13.501
Bye.

40:18.516 --> 40:21.314
To be honest with you, Cam,
I don't know what to make of all of this.

40:21.419 --> 40:25.412
Those Air Force people who made us all
sign those papers were pretty scary.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.582
I'm not sure I'm allowed
to even think about what happened,

40:27.691 --> 40:29.283
let alone talk about it.

40:29.393 --> 40:31.224
It's better this way.

40:31.328 --> 40:34.161
People who do talk about it
just end up looking crazy.

40:34.265 --> 40:38.895
There's never any proof
and there is always plausible denial.

40:39.804 --> 40:42.102
So you've done this sort of thing before?

40:42.206 --> 40:43.867
I'm just saying...

40:44.475 --> 40:46.773
I know, you can't talk about it.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.937
You can't even tell me
what was really going on the other night.

40:51.882 --> 40:53.713
I do know this much.

40:53.818 --> 40:56.946
That man was trying to kill you
and your friends.

40:58.088 --> 41:01.216
Whatever it is you do,
it's obviously dangerous.

41:02.259 --> 41:06.218
It's a job that has to be done.

41:11.135 --> 41:14.627
And that's all I'm gonna say about that.

41:16.941 --> 41:20.843
Well, if anybody has to be out there
protecting us

41:20.945 --> 41:23.846
from things
we're not allowed to know about,

41:24.515 --> 41:26.745
I'm glad it's someone like you.

Colorado Springs,
it's not that far away, so,

41:57.114 --> 42:01.983
maybe someday soon,
you might think about taking a little trip.

42:04.154 --> 42:05.348
Maybe.

42:07.491 --> 42:10.358
She's a nice girl. I like her.

42:10.628 --> 42:13.324
Nice? She's a cure for insomnia.

42:14.732 --> 42:17.997
Well, we can't all make
the brilliant decisions you've made.

How many times
have you been married, anyway?

42:23.674 --> 42:25.039
Well, it's hard to keep track.

42:25.142 --> 42:29.169
Let's see, the first one was part of
a band of traveling entertainers.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.147
He was a good cook, too.
Couldn't make pie, though.

42:32.249 --> 42:34.740
You know, forget it. Forget I asked.
