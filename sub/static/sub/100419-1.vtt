02:08.720 --> 02:10.680
-Shut up!
-I know, it sounds great.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.640
It really hasn't dated at all.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.640
-Don't be late.
-I won't.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.160
Good luck with the selection.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.080
Don't let the fact that I've made
A-team every year add to the pressure.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.000
You'll be fine.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.240
-Dickhead.
-Hey.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.520
-Warning.
-A-team dickhead.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.720
Can we please get this crap off?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.160
-That's strike two.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.840
That's not even swearing.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.040
Dad, "crap" is not swearing.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.240
-All right, mate.
-Hey. You're not playing, Adam?

02:41.320 --> 02:43.160
-Playing?
-Yeah, Dads V Lads.

02:43.720 --> 02:44.680
Dads V Lads?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.440
Oh, shit... Uh, shoot. Um...

02:47.040 --> 02:50.000
Sorry. It's Dads V Lads. I... forgot.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.360
Right.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.480
Right, it looks like
we've found our goalie.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.880
Here's to total humiliation by kids.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.840
Speak for yourself.
I thought I had a good game.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.480
Oh, god.
He's putting up a flip chart.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.840
Wait till he hands out the agenda.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.840
-Last year it was laminated.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.000
It's Corinne.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.240
Tell her I've been on teacher trips.
I know what goes on.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.880
Hey, babe. How's the conference?

03:33.960 --> 03:35.840
<i>Aw, it's tough,</i>
<i>it's really tough.</i>

03:36.680 --> 03:40.520
I'm currently recuperating
after a hot bath and two glasses of Rioja.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.960
Well, me and the boys are on a pub crawl.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.840
Ryan's getting the Sambucas in.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.760
- Where are you? Football?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

03:47.840 --> 03:49.880
Hey, listen, did you know
it was dads and lads?

03:49.960 --> 03:51.120
<i>Yeah, I wrote it on the note.</i>

03:52.160 --> 03:54.600
-What note?
<i>-The one that's attached to the fridge.</i>

03:55.320 --> 03:57.160
-What fridge?
<i>-Oh, ha ha.</i>

03:57.240 --> 03:59.680
Listen, will you text me
when you know which team he's on?

03:59.760 --> 04:01.160
<i>Oh, God, I hope it's the A.</i>

04:01.240 --> 04:04.160
Tom's really winding him up,
and this Ryan swearing thing...

04:04.240 --> 04:06.400
<i>I know. God, it's a nightmare.</i>

04:06.480 --> 04:08.680
Potty-mouthed little prick.
Takes after his mother.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.040
Oh, God.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.040
Bob's agenda.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.320
You're not gonna believe this.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.280
Bob's agenda...

04:20.680 --> 04:23.320
has got 26 items on it.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.520
Ah, yeah, well, I'm...
I'm just gutted I can't be there.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.840
<i>I'm sure you are.</i>

04:27.920 --> 04:29.360
I think you've done this on purpose.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.920
I don't think there even is a conference.
I'm gonna ask the other teachers.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.800
<i>Actually, know what? I better get going.</i>

04:34.880 --> 04:36.760
<i>I have got dinner in half an hour.</i>

04:36.840 --> 04:39.200
All right, love. Well, you enjoy yourself.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.200
Oh, yeah, I will. I fully intend to.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.120
Love you.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.440
<i>Yeah, love you. Bye.</i>

04:43.520 --> 04:44.520
Bye.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.280
Wife left you to it, has she?

04:55.480 --> 04:57.320
Ah, yeah, she's away.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.320
-Calls it work.
-Hmm.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.440
So have you got a kid
playing in the match or what?

05:10.360 --> 05:11.200
No.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.920
You didn't have to stay with her,
you know.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.000
What?

05:20.640 --> 05:23.240
Corinne. You didn't have to stay
when she told you she was pregnant.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.920
I'm sorry. Do... do I know you?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.440
Two years ago,
she told you she was pregnant, right?

05:29.520 --> 05:30.480
That's why you stayed.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.200
She told you she was pregnant
and then she lost the baby.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.560
-Who are you?
-She lied, Adam.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.320
She made it up. She was never pregnant.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.520
Who are you? Why are you saying this?

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
Does that really matter?

05:43.200 --> 05:44.520
Yeah, it does.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.280
Okay.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.560
Think of me as a stranger.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.080
A stranger that knows.

05:51.960 --> 05:52.800
She had a bump.

05:52.880 --> 05:53.720
It was fake.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.280
Cast your mind back to that time.
Did you ever see her naked?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.040
Fully naked?

05:59.760 --> 06:00.800
It wasn't real.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.840
Excuses to avoid sex and sickness.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.000
When the miscarriage came,
you look back and realized

06:07.080 --> 06:09.040
the pregnancy had been difficult
from the start.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.400
It's gone.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.720
How do you know my wife?
Who the hell are you?

06:12.800 --> 06:14.440
All right, folks, grab your beers.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.880
Let's get this show on the road.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.800
Think of me as a friend
that just released you from prison.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.400
You're full of shit.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.400
-You should be thanking me.
-Yeah? Why is that?

06:23.240 --> 06:25.440
Because now you know she's a liar.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.600
She faked the whole thing.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.880
- Adam?
-Yeah.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.960
If you need proof, look at your Visa card

06:35.040 --> 06:37.520
and check for a charge to Novelty Funsy.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.120
And one more thing.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.720
If I were you...

06:43.600 --> 06:45.760
I'd run DNA checks on your two boys.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.520
Hey. Wait.

07:04.080 --> 07:04.920
Stop!

07:05.400 --> 07:06.320
Who are you?!

07:34.880 --> 07:35.760
Corinne.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.800
It's gone.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.760
I've lost it.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.800
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.280
I love you so much.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.160
<i>Hi, this is Corinne. Leave a message.</i>

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Hey, it's me.

08:17.720 --> 08:18.640
Doesn't matter.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.960
Made the A-team. Good result.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.520
Absolutely.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.640
Yeah, except Jimmy Hoch making the A's.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.000
What's that all about?

08:29.080 --> 08:30.600
-Yeah, well--
-What?

08:31.880 --> 08:34.360
Ah, you know me, Adam.
I'm not one for gossip.

08:34.440 --> 08:35.280
Bob lost his job.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.160
Since when?

08:37.240 --> 08:39.320
Six weeks ago.
But he doesn't want anyone knowing.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.600
Anyway, he has this headhunter
helping him find a job.

08:42.680 --> 08:45.400
This very successful headhunter.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.320
Stephen Hoch.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.280
Jimmy's dad? You're kidding.
That's outrageous.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.920
Come on, you're a lawyer.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.640
This shit happens all the time.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.480
When it comes to looking after ourselves
and our kids, then...

08:57.960 --> 08:59.040
...we're all corrupt.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.160
All right, see you tomorrow, mate.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.640
Ryan.

11:45.960 --> 11:46.840
The fuck?

12:14.080 --> 12:15.920
She made it up. She was never pregnant.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.320
Now you know she's a liar.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.080
<i>To help us</i>
<i>deal with your call quickly,</i>

12:21.160 --> 12:24.080
<i>please tell us in a few words</i>
<i>why you are calling today.</i>

12:24.160 --> 12:26.520
Query, payments, card transactions.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.760
<i>I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?</i>

12:28.840 --> 12:30.560
Card transactions.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.840
<i>-I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?</i>
-Speak to a fucking human being!

12:34.920 --> 12:38.120
<i>Please hold while we connect you</i>
<i>to one of our representatives.</i>

12:40.880 --> 12:42.760
<i>Hello. My name's Peter.</i>
<i>How can I help you today?</i>

12:42.840 --> 12:45.240
Yeah, there's a...
there's a charge on my account

12:45.320 --> 12:47.120
from a while back that I don't recognize.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.400
I think it might be a mistake.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.600
<i>-What's the name of the company?</i>
-Novelty Funsy.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.920
<i>How are you spelling Funsy?</i>

12:53.400 --> 12:55.560
Fun-sy. S-Y.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.440
<i>And the date of the transaction?</i>

12:57.600 --> 12:58.600
Uh...

12:59.280 --> 13:00.360
January...

13:01.600 --> 13:02.720
fifteenth.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.040
January 15th, 2017.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.600
<i>Ah, yeah. Some companies don't bill</i>
<i>under their real name.</i>

13:08.680 --> 13:10.280
<i>It's for discretion.</i>

13:11.680 --> 13:13.000
Discretion?

13:13.080 --> 13:16.120
<i>Yeah, like in hotels when adult movies</i>
<i>appear as something else.</i>

13:16.200 --> 13:18.680
-Uh, so what is it?
<i>-It's an online retailer,</i>

13:18.760 --> 13:20.680
<i>so I'll need to raise a specific inquiry</i>

13:20.760 --> 13:22.960
<i>if you're sure this is something</i>
<i>that you didn't purchase.</i>

13:23.040 --> 13:24.160
Yep, I'm sure.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.600
<i>I'll raise the inquiry.</i>
<i>Can we get back to you on this number?</i>

13:26.680 --> 13:28.320
-Yep, thank you.
<i>-Have a good evening.</i>

13:34.760 --> 13:35.840
Dad?

13:37.440 --> 13:39.640
-Is it okay if Daisy stays?
-I'll sleep in the spare room.

13:39.720 --> 13:40.760
Did you ask your mom?

13:40.840 --> 13:42.240
Yeah, she's cool with it.

13:42.760 --> 13:43.600
Okay.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.160
How did Ryan get on?

13:45.560 --> 13:46.920
Yep, made the A.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.720
Brother of their star player.
It was inevitable.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.480
<i>♪ We're gonna break some hearts tonight ♪</i>

14:01.760 --> 14:05.080
<i>♪ We're blowing up like dynamite, yeah ♪</i>

14:05.160 --> 14:09.440

14:09.520 --> 14:13.120
<i>♪ We're gonna break some hearts tonight ♪</i>

14:22.600 --> 14:23.440
Dais.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.080
-I just--
-I know.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.880
We're gonna be going away...

14:29.600 --> 14:31.120
Different unis.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.160
I just...

14:32.800 --> 14:34.680
-I don't want it to be a big thing.
-It won't.

14:34.760 --> 14:35.840
I promise.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.960
Look, we're casual.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.720
No strings.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.000
This is a very casual kiss.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.080
What?

14:55.520 --> 14:56.360
Hey.

14:56.440 --> 14:57.640
Why didn't you just text?

14:58.280 --> 15:00.760
Prefer this. Old school.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.520
Two minutes.

15:25.640 --> 15:29.240
<i>-♪ Yeah ♪</i>

16:11.360 --> 16:13.560
Turn on your side.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.120
Phillip.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.480
-God...

16:22.560 --> 16:23.560
<i>So, uh...</i>

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
guess what?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.320
I finally told him.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.960
<i>Oh, my God. How was it?</i>

16:29.160 --> 16:30.800
Surprisingly mature.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.520
<i>-Huh, really?</i>
-I know.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.200
What did you say?

16:34.280 --> 16:35.200
Sit.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.960
<i>Just the truth. You know, I said that--</i>

16:38.040 --> 16:39.520
Sit! Now come here. Now, sit!

16:39.840 --> 16:41.720
No, no, no! Sit!

16:41.800 --> 16:43.000
Uh...

16:43.080 --> 16:45.080
I said we've had 26 years.

16:45.160 --> 16:48.280
<i>Many of them happy, and that's</i>
<i>not a failure, that's a success.</i>

16:48.360 --> 16:50.000
-But, you know--

16:50.640 --> 16:51.520
Oh.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.160
But, you know, now it's time
for something else.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.600
I tried a new house analogy,

16:57.680 --> 17:00.680
but that all got a bit muddled.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.160
Was he upset?

17:02.760 --> 17:03.920
<i>Hard to tell with Phil.</i>

17:04.000 --> 17:05.200
<i>He slept in the spare room,</i>

17:05.280 --> 17:08.640
but I think that was mostly symbolic.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.760
-God.

17:10.840 --> 17:11.880
Oh.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.040
Christ.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.480
Sorry, the infant keeps calling me.
I better find out what he wants.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.320
<i>-Can I call you back?</i>
-Right.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.120
What is it?

17:22.200 --> 17:23.720
<i>What is it? </i>

17:23.800 --> 17:25.960
<i>I'll tell you what it is,</i>
<i>some fucking weird shit.</i>

17:33.160 --> 17:34.960
What are you doing on that thing?

17:37.160 --> 17:39.800
"Investigating crime, really brutal. LOL."

17:39.880 --> 17:41.680
Ooh, you're showing your age now, Jo.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.600
It's Johanna. How many times with that?

17:44.120 --> 17:47.080
And anyway, I thought you liked us oldies.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.120
He's not that old.
He's not, like, your age.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.920
You said your new man was old enough
to be your father.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.920
Yes, technically, but you're actually
old enough to be my mother.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.160
And even mathematically, my gran.

17:58.480 --> 17:59.440
Where's the body?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.080
Don't you dare.

18:27.720 --> 18:28.920
You've not seen the head?

18:29.960 --> 18:33.480
No. No, it's just that,
lying there like that.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.840
Oh, it's giving me the creeps.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.400
What is it?

18:37.480 --> 18:38.520
Some kind of sheep?

18:38.600 --> 18:41.160
-No, the neck's too long.
-Giraffe?

18:43.560 --> 18:44.760
Joking.

18:44.840 --> 18:45.800
Too small.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.000
I'm guessing, but llama.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.000
Alpaca.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.040
What do you think's
going on there, on the leg?

18:52.040 --> 18:54.440
-Are they bite marks?
- I can't look anymore.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.400
I can't look.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.080
Bite marks.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.680
And judging from the size
and the shape of the indents...

19:00.760 --> 19:03.240
I'd say there's a reasonable chance
that they're human.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.520
Hello.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.120
-Ah, hello--
-Hi. We're from--

19:35.600 --> 19:36.960
Hello, I'm...

19:37.520 --> 19:39.360
DS Johanna Griffin.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.680
This is DC Wesley Ross.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.400
There's no cause for concern.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.440
We're just looking into an incident
about a mile or so from here

19:46.520 --> 19:47.600
which involves an animal.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.440
Looks very much like a white alpaca.

19:49.800 --> 19:50.880
You think it's one of mine?

19:51.320 --> 19:53.880
Well, logic dictates.
You know, they're not the most common--

19:53.960 --> 19:54.960
We'll soon see.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.800
Gary,

20:00.880 --> 20:02.920
Jason, Howard,

20:03.400 --> 20:04.880
Mark, Robbie.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.360
They're all there.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.480
Liam,

20:11.560 --> 20:12.440
Niall...

20:13.200 --> 20:14.240
Harry,

20:14.320 --> 20:15.240
Zayn...

20:16.400 --> 20:17.280
Louis.

20:18.880 --> 20:19.720
It's Louis.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.040
What's happened? Is he dead?

20:22.320 --> 20:26.000
Uh, I-- I'm afraid so.
Yes, I'm... I'm sorry.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.440
And he's... he's been...

20:29.520 --> 20:30.640
decapitated.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.560
Decapitated?

20:34.600 --> 20:37.200
Have you got any CCTV? You know, any...

20:37.800 --> 20:38.840
visual security?

20:39.400 --> 20:41.240
It's an alpaca farm, not Port Knox.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.000
Oh, shit.

20:48.960 --> 20:49.920
It's "Fort" Knox.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.920
It's where the Americans keep their gold.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
I know.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.520
Really?

20:55.800 --> 20:57.840
No, I'm thinking of Alcatraz.

21:05.760 --> 21:06.840
Hey, Mr. Price.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.200
Mike. When did you arrive?

21:10.200 --> 21:12.400
Kind of earlier.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.320
Huh.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.240
I didn't hear ya.

21:15.920 --> 21:16.760
Right.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.160
No.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.680
Tom upstairs?

21:22.240 --> 21:23.160
Shower.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.280
-Hey.
-You've got three.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.720
-Give me the pancake.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.200
I still want it.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.160
-Hello.
-Gross.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.920
<i>It's Martin.</i>
<i>That Parth fella has just turned up.</i>

21:33.000 --> 21:34.480
Shit. Uh...

21:35.120 --> 21:36.200
I'm on my way.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.000
-Hey, bud.
-Mike?

21:41.080 --> 21:41.960
Now.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.640
Hello?

22:18.280 --> 22:19.200
In here.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.440
Where is he?

22:28.120 --> 22:29.160
Oh, he's safe.

22:30.040 --> 22:30.960
-Martin.
- Hello?

22:31.480 --> 22:33.560
- Is someone there?
- He's down there.

22:34.760 --> 22:36.280
-The cellar?
-Yep.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.120
It's not
fucking <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

22:38.440 --> 22:39.760
Okay. Um...

22:42.320 --> 22:44.720
Professionally speaking,
I have to tell you that this is...

22:44.800 --> 22:46.560
-Don't listen to him! He's mental.
-...kidnap.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.520
- He's absolutely mental!
-Bullshit.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.200
Well, you are kind of holding him
against his will.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.760
I was a cop for 30 years, Adam.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.040
-I understand the definition of kidnap.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.320
-The door closed behind him.
- Let me out!

23:00.360 --> 23:01.360
Okay.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.160
- I can't breathe!
-Uh...

23:05.120 --> 23:06.320
Do you mind if I...?

23:06.960 --> 23:08.080
Be my guest.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.720
But remember whose side you're on.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.520
All right! All right! All right!

23:17.880 --> 23:20.480
Are you fucking kidding me?
I've been down there nearly an hour.

23:20.560 --> 23:21.800
Forty-three minutes.

23:21.880 --> 23:22.960
You're crazy. He's crazy.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.000
Okay, just calm down.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.600
Calm down? I'm calling the police.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.480
-Give me me phone.
-I haven't got it.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.160
-Give him his phone.
-He's stolen me fuckin' phone!

23:31.240 --> 23:32.600
-He's an old man.
-Fuck off.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.080
You are. He's an old man
that doesn't want to move.

23:35.160 --> 23:37.840
Doesn't wanna sell. He's not interested
in your redevelopment program.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.600
And he really doesn't appreciate you
showing up here unannounced,

23:40.680 --> 23:42.840
waving your big, fat,
corporate checkbook around.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.360
Now, we've lodged our objection,
we've adhered to the deadline,

23:45.440 --> 23:47.160
and now due process needs to take place.

23:47.240 --> 23:50.440
And due process can be very, very slow.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.840
Cup of tea, anyone?

23:54.640 --> 23:57.720
Okay, you're his lawyer.
How much does he want?

23:58.440 --> 23:59.680
A billion pounds.

24:01.920 --> 24:05.720
I shouldn't tell you this, but I've been
authorized to go as high as 400,000.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.800
I shouldn't tell you this,
but I've been authorized

24:07.880 --> 24:09.440
to say no to whatever you offer.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.640
He can't win, the stupid, old fuck!

24:11.720 --> 24:12.760
And tricks like that...

24:14.320 --> 24:15.160
Yeah...

24:15.240 --> 24:16.640
smile it up, asshole.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.000
You know and I know,

24:18.080 --> 24:19.360
everyone's got their price.

24:19.720 --> 24:20.840
-Have they?
-Yeah.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.880
And in the end, trust me,

24:22.960 --> 24:24.880
the big guy always wins.

24:26.760 --> 24:27.760
Lanky streak of piss.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.160
Behave.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.240
-You think she sleeps with her alpacas?
- Nope.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.360
Not sex, just cuddles.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.360
Maybe gets one in now and again
on a cold winter's night.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.840
I know a lad who used to sleep
with a massive red setter,

24:46.920 --> 24:49.520
like, under the covers,
its head on his pillow.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.560
I said, "Is that not a little--" Stop!

24:51.640 --> 24:53.120
What? What is it?

24:53.560 --> 24:54.680
Back there, drive back.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.440
What is it?

25:09.360 --> 25:11.240
Wes, where are we going?

25:27.560 --> 25:28.400
Right.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.800
There's more.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.440
Jesus. Creepy.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.880
There's a shoe.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.560
Something's not right here.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.080
Wes?

26:38.160 --> 26:39.240
Yeah.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.720
Footprints. Not shoes, feet.

27:00.800 --> 27:01.680
Johanna!

27:02.280 --> 27:03.200
Johanna!

27:04.680 --> 27:05.680
Shit.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.720
Over here!

27:16.040 --> 27:18.080
Get an ambulance and call for backup!

27:19.400 --> 27:20.240
Shit.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.400
DC Ross, assistance required,

27:24.480 --> 27:26.200
also an ambulance right now.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.160
He's alive!

27:37.960 --> 27:39.000
Hello.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.760
<i>Hi. Is that Mr. Price?</i>

27:40.840 --> 27:41.680
Speaking.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.160
<i>Hi. It's Hashim from Derwent Bank.</i>

27:44.240 --> 27:46.200
<i>I believe you put in a request last night</i>

27:46.280 --> 27:49.120
<i>for the identity of a company</i>
<i>that has the billing name...</i>

27:49.600 --> 27:50.880
<i>Novelty Funsy.</i>

27:51.440 --> 27:52.800
Yeah, that's right.

27:52.880 --> 27:57.000
<i>Right. Well, I'm afraid we can't identify</i>
<i>exactly what the payment relates to.</i>

27:57.480 --> 28:00.920
<i>It seems to be an umbrella title</i>
<i>that covers several different websites.</i>

28:01.360 --> 28:02.720
Uh, okay.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.120
No worries.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.600
<i>I've got a list of the ISP addresses,</i>
<i>which I'm happy to send you,</i>

28:07.680 --> 28:09.800
<i>but obviously, I can't identify</i>
<i>which of these,</i>

28:09.880 --> 28:11.680
<i>if any, is the source of the purchase.</i>

28:12.480 --> 28:15.160
<i>Would you like me to email this</i>
<i>to the address we have on file?</i>

28:17.040 --> 28:18.920
Um, yeah, sure, of course.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.960
<i>-I'll send it over now.</i>
-Please.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.040
Thank you.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.120
Sorry.

28:34.920 --> 28:35.760
Work call.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.320
Back early?

28:39.760 --> 28:41.960
Yeah. The lunch thing got canceled.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.320
-Thank God.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.760
Hey, you made the A-team.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.800
Oh, come here. Let me hug you.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.880
-Mom.
-Oh, come on.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.640
God, none of your friends are watching.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.640
How was the conference?
Did Selena behave herself?

28:54.720 --> 28:57.600
Uh, <i>Serena </i>was perfectly professional,

28:57.680 --> 28:59.760
right up until the point
she dashed outside to vomit.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.320
Coffee?

29:02.400 --> 29:04.720
-Yeah, I'll do it.
-Come on, I wanna hear all about footie.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.520
Oh, Corinne?

29:07.120 --> 29:09.120
Hi. Is Daisy still here?

29:09.200 --> 29:10.920
Oh, yeah, she stayed the night.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I need her to look after Ella for an hour.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.120
She was supposed to play hockey
but suddenly decided--

29:15.200 --> 29:16.680
I haven't suddenly decided.

29:16.760 --> 29:19.640
Okay.
Well, she's got a stomach ache.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.240
Doesn't feel well,
doesn't want to play.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.640
However, I've got a training run.
Triathlon's in three weeks.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.560
Just go.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.240
I will.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.560
If you're sick I need to make sure
you're with someone.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.480
It's all right.
We can take her for an hour.

29:30.840 --> 29:31.800
Thanks.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.600
Ugh. I don't know what's wrong with her.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.400
It's like she's depressed.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.080
Doesn't want to go to school,
doesn't want to play sports.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.880
-She's making up the tummy ache thing.
-You know, she's at that age.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.200
Want me to try talking to her?

29:43.720 --> 29:45.240
Well, you can try.

29:46.240 --> 29:49.040
I supposed it could be worse.
Did you hear about Dante?

29:49.520 --> 29:50.840
No. What?

29:50.920 --> 29:52.520
He didn't come home last night.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.120
His mother's beside herself.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.920
Who'd be a parent?

29:57.640 --> 29:58.840
I'll see you later.

29:58.920 --> 29:59.920
Yeah. Bye.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.560
<i>I was having a surrogate pregnancy.</i>

31:10.640 --> 31:11.720
<i>Didn't want people to know.</i>

31:12.160 --> 31:15.520
<i>So I used fakepregnancy.co.uk</i>

31:15.600 --> 31:18.960
<i>to pretend that I was going</i>
<i>through the normal cycles.</i>

31:19.720 --> 31:21.240
<i>No one suspected a thing.</i>

31:32.400 --> 31:33.840
Sorry I couldn't be there.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.080
You were when it counted.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.240
It's gone.

31:49.720 --> 31:50.760
I've lost it.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.360
<i>...two, three, four...</i>

32:01.440 --> 32:04.440
I'm just showing him
what teachers get up to outside of school.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.000
-Can I have a word.
-What?

32:06.360 --> 32:07.200
Garden.

32:07.880 --> 32:08.840
Okay.

32:25.560 --> 32:26.560
What's going on?

32:27.800 --> 32:29.120
Did you fake your pregnancy?

32:30.040 --> 32:32.800
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Can we just skip this part?

32:33.440 --> 32:35.320
-What?
-The part where you pretend not to know

32:35.400 --> 32:37.680
what I'm talking about.
Let's just skip the denials, okay?

32:38.400 --> 32:40.320
I know you faked your pregnancy.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.600
Well, if you know, why are you asking?

32:44.840 --> 32:45.800
What about the boys?

32:45.880 --> 32:47.480
-The boys?
-Are they mine?

32:48.040 --> 32:49.600
Are you out of your mind?

32:49.680 --> 32:52.240
You faked a pregnancy, Corinne.
What else are you capable of?

32:54.640 --> 32:55.920
Are they mine?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.880
Yes! Christ, Adam.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.560
Look at Tom's face, your eyes,
your-- your-- your hair.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.240
How... How can you even ask me that?

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
So...

33:06.480 --> 33:07.560
talk to me.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.320
What makes you think I faked a pregnancy?

33:10.840 --> 33:12.080
Credit card payment.

33:12.640 --> 33:13.600
Novelty Funsy.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.720
It's a cover name
for a fake pregnancy website.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.440
-Right. How do you know that was for me?
-Was it?

33:20.320 --> 33:22.640
What are you even doing
looking through bank statements--?

33:22.720 --> 33:23.560
Stalling.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.920
Corinne...

33:28.760 --> 33:29.960
you lied to me.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.840
You lied to the boys.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.880
Now, you better start talking right now.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.120
Corinne.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.680
Do you remember when I had
two school periods off during lunch?

33:43.360 --> 33:45.040
-What about it?

33:45.120 --> 33:47.280
Well, I used to get out of school
for a couple of hours.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.240
I'd go to that café in Portis Books.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.040
I'd get a cup of tea,
sit in the corner reading,

33:52.120 --> 33:55.240
and after a while, Adam,
you become a regular.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.480
The same people will be there
like a community--

33:57.560 --> 33:59.160
-And?
-There was this woman.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.040
Suzanne Hope.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.200
She was eight months pregnant.
It was her first baby.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.600
You know how young mothers-to-be are,
all glowing

34:07.680 --> 34:10.200
and over the top like they're
the first person to get pregnant--

34:10.280 --> 34:12.680
Great story. Can we get back
to the fucking elephant sat here?

34:12.760 --> 34:14.720
Can you just drop the sarcasm, Adam?

34:14.800 --> 34:16.280
I'm trying to tell you something.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.880
-So tell me.
-I liked her.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.600
We became friendly.

34:19.680 --> 34:21.480
And then one day she just stopped coming.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.640
Now, I...
I just assumed she'd had the baby.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.560
She was way overdue.

34:25.640 --> 34:27.600
But she didn't reply
to any of my messages.

34:27.680 --> 34:28.720
Adam, please listen.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.520
And she just killed all my calls--

34:30.600 --> 34:32.400
-Is this going somewhere?
-A few months later,

34:32.480 --> 34:36.480
I saw her again in Starbucks
near the library and she was pregnant.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.440
Okay.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.480
Heavily pregnant, Adam, like eight months.

34:39.560 --> 34:40.400
So?

34:40.480 --> 34:41.880
Well, it didn't make any sense.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.240
So I just--
I held back and I watched her.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.800
And she was with this group
of other women in the corner

34:46.880 --> 34:50.440
holding court, talking to them
about... about baby names.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.600
And when she saw me
she just looked terrified.

34:53.680 --> 34:54.840
Did you say something to her?

34:54.920 --> 34:55.960
Yes, I did.

34:56.040 --> 34:59.240
She told me some story about having
a stillborn. I don't know if it was true--

34:59.320 --> 35:01.040
Corinne, what are you talking about?

35:01.120 --> 35:02.280
Please, Adam.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.360
She loved being pregnant.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.760
It made her feel special.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.000
So she faked a pregnancy?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.280
That's insane.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.800
No, no, Corinne,
that is not normal behavior.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.880
Yeah, well, she said her husband
didn't care about her. She had no--

35:20.960 --> 35:23.560
What does this got to do with us?
You've got children, got me.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.560
What?

35:25.640 --> 35:28.960
Crazy Suzanne and her shitty little life
made you think, "I'll fake a baby."

35:29.040 --> 35:30.320
Why would you do that?

35:31.200 --> 35:33.200
Why would you fake a baby, Corinne?

35:34.520 --> 35:36.960
For attention? Is this some kind
of deranged midlife crisis?

35:37.040 --> 35:38.040
-Stop.
-Okay, I'll stop.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.320
But you need to tell me everything
from start to finish--

35:40.400 --> 35:41.240
-No.
-What?

35:41.320 --> 35:42.360
I said no.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.320
-You're not just gonna walk away.
-What are you gonna do? Keep me captive?

35:45.400 --> 35:47.000
You owe me an explanation.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.000
I need some time.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.160
Just tell me!

35:49.880 --> 35:52.560
What are you gonna do, Adam?
Beat it out of me?

35:54.480 --> 35:55.800
How did you find out?

35:55.880 --> 35:57.760
A woman, a stranger.
I've never seen her before.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.440
-She came up to me and she--
-What woman?

35:59.520 --> 36:01.240
I've just told you, a stranger.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.600
How does she know any of this?

36:02.680 --> 36:04.800
And you, what, you just believed her?

36:08.240 --> 36:09.840
I just need you...

36:10.320 --> 36:11.760
to tell me the truth.

36:12.680 --> 36:13.640
And I will.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.760
I will, I promise, but just...

36:16.840 --> 36:19.000
-Not like this. Not now.
-Corinne?

36:19.080 --> 36:21.360
This is insane. Corinne?

36:23.760 --> 36:24.640
Adam...

36:26.640 --> 36:28.040
this isn't what you think.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.680
There's more to this.

36:31.920 --> 36:32.880
So tell me.

36:58.120 --> 36:58.960
Mom?

36:59.600 --> 37:01.440
-Is everything all right?
-Everything's fine.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.120
What are they saying?

38:01.200 --> 38:02.360
Still unresponsive.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.640
Indications of moderate brain injury.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.680
Could've hit a tree,
could've been something else.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.280
They're guessing
he'd been there for hours.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.520
Hours?

38:14.920 --> 38:16.800
-What?
-Do you think he jumped?

38:16.880 --> 38:17.800
Why?

38:17.880 --> 38:20.560
We pushed through those trees clothed.
They're hard to get through.

38:20.640 --> 38:23.040
You aren't darting through at speed
and falling down that drop,

38:23.120 --> 38:26.120
you're coming through slowly,
thinking, "Whoa, big drop."

38:27.320 --> 38:29.840
-But if it was dark--
-If it was dark, you'd go even slower.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.440
Especially with your dick out.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.720
Hey, trust me,
this is my area of expertise.

38:36.120 --> 38:37.360
So why was he naked?

38:39.040 --> 38:41.320
He's run through the woods
shedding his clothes.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.480
Turned on by mutilating an alpaca.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.640
-If they're connected.
-If.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.680
-Let's not jump to conclusions.
-No, no, sure.

38:47.760 --> 38:51.400
I mean, two really bizarre events
happen within a mile of each other.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.160
Why would they be?

38:55.400 --> 38:58.520
Let's find out who he is first.
Check for misper calls.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.880
Someone must be worried
this one didn't come home last night.

40:12.720 --> 40:13.600
I'll bring it over.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.400
My dear.

40:24.480 --> 40:25.960
Just what I need. Thank you.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.400
-Here's to the new Johanna.
-Cheers.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.320
Cheers.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.040
No regrets?

40:33.120 --> 40:34.400
-Not yet.
-Hmm.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.920
I'll tell you what,
I won't miss the snoring.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.760
He's in the spare room
and it's still, like, a thousand decibels.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.280
Listen to you.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.200
What?

40:42.280 --> 40:45.440
"Like, a thousand decibels."
That infant's rubbing off on you.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.920
There's another good reason to retire.

40:51.680 --> 40:52.520
Let's do the trip.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.240
Come on. I mean,
you're gonna be out of a job.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.840
You're out of your marriage.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.360
We always said we'd do it, Johanna.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.480
You've got this place.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.680
Yeah, which can be looked after.

41:04.760 --> 41:05.600
And two dogs.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.920
And a husband that can look after them.

41:08.760 --> 41:09.800
Come on.

41:10.480 --> 41:13.320
Me and you,
Thelma and Louise across the states.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.080
All we've gotta do is book the flights
and we're doing it.

41:17.520 --> 41:19.440
"I'm in deep shit, Thelma.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.480
-Deep shit, Arkinsaw."

42:03.240 --> 42:04.480
Listen. Um...

42:05.320 --> 42:07.840
What you said yesterday, you were right.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.600
You deserve to know everything.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.640
And I want to explain, I do.

42:13.720 --> 42:15.920
But not like this, Adam.

42:16.360 --> 42:17.440
Not angry.

42:19.880 --> 42:22.040
We have this school awards thing tonight.

42:22.120 --> 42:25.040
Why don't we just eat after
at Juniper Yard?

42:25.720 --> 42:27.360
We can eat and I'll talk,

42:27.440 --> 42:28.400
and then...

42:29.200 --> 42:31.240
then we can see where we are.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.520
You know the worst part
about all of this?

42:41.400 --> 42:42.680
I've stopped trusting you.

42:46.000 --> 42:46.920
I know.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.040
It hurts, doesn't it?

42:55.240 --> 42:56.960
We all have our secrets, Adam.

42:58.640 --> 42:59.600
Even you.

43:13.560 --> 43:16.640
His name's Dante Gunnarsson. His parents
reported him missing yesterday.

43:16.720 --> 43:19.880
He spends a lot of time out and about
so they weren't immediately concerned.

43:19.960 --> 43:21.400
-Are they with him?
-At the hospital.

43:21.480 --> 43:23.000
He's stable but unresponsive.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.800
They're doing an EEG this morning.

43:24.880 --> 43:25.960
In the meantime...

43:28.040 --> 43:30.760
"The lacerations on the animal
are from human teeth."

43:31.480 --> 43:32.520
But...

43:33.800 --> 43:36.720
"Human bite is usually
an elliptical injury.

43:36.800 --> 43:39.400
However, in this case,
the pattern is interrupted

43:39.480 --> 43:41.960
by the absence of a left bicuspid."

43:42.400 --> 43:43.640
I rang the hospital.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.480
Our boy has all his teeth.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.480
So, there's someone else.

43:48.560 --> 43:49.680
There's someone else.

44:30.840 --> 44:31.680
Vicky.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.320
Bob, hello.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.400
Have you seen Corinne?

44:40.480 --> 44:41.400
Nowhere, no.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.200
Oh, Vicky, can I have a word?

44:46.160 --> 44:48.680
I just wanted to ask,
and it's probably not a huge deal,

44:48.760 --> 44:52.000
but your Ella,
she's stopped talking with Mia.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.160
And Mia said something's happened,

44:54.240 --> 44:55.680
but she won't say what it is.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.480
Do you have any idea what's going on?

44:59.000 --> 45:00.440
No. No, none at all.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.480
Well, there's something strange.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.160
I just thought you should know.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.400
She's been a bit down but...

45:08.600 --> 45:10.200
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

45:21.440 --> 45:24.080
<i>-Hi. This is Corinne. Leave a message.</i>

45:30.000 --> 45:34.240
Sadly, I must begin this evening
of celebration with some difficult news.

45:34.720 --> 45:37.480
One of our year 12 pupils,
Dante Gunnarsson,

45:37.560 --> 45:39.960
has been involved in a serious accident.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.000
And I'm afraid
he's in a very worrying condition.

45:44.320 --> 45:47.680
I'm sure you will all join me
in wishing him and his family

45:47.760 --> 45:50.520
all the best for his swift recovery.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.160
But we must carry on

45:54.240 --> 45:55.320
in difficult times,

45:55.400 --> 45:57.680
and this evening is about celebrating

45:57.760 --> 45:59.680
those students who have achieved

45:59.760 --> 46:00.840
or excelled...

46:01.440 --> 46:04.480
in this, their final year, of high school.

46:14.560 --> 46:17.920
And the award for art
goes to Kiran Penvell.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.360
Peter Harris.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.720
Michelle Vosler.

46:30.840 --> 46:32.440
And the one you've all been waiting for,

46:33.240 --> 46:34.920
the most visible underwear award...

46:36.000 --> 46:37.080
No, seriously.

46:37.160 --> 46:40.840
The award for best sporting achievement
goes to Anthony Carter.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.280
Go on!

46:49.240 --> 46:53.320
The final award this evening
is our award, the students',

46:53.400 --> 46:56.120
and we were asked to vote
for our teacher of the year.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.000
And I've been asked to say

46:58.080 --> 47:01.480
that it has been a really close
competition, as they're all so great.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.520
Sadly, there can only be one winner.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.960
And that person is...

47:08.760 --> 47:09.600
Mrs. Price.

47:53.320 --> 47:54.320
Hi.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.640
I'm not Mrs. Price, obviously.

47:56.720 --> 47:57.720
Um...

47:58.280 --> 48:00.720
Uh, Corinne can't be here tonight.

48:00.800 --> 48:01.920
She's, um...

48:02.000 --> 48:02.920
She's unwell.

48:04.320 --> 48:06.640
But I'd just like to say
how much this'll mean to her.

48:06.720 --> 48:07.640
She...

48:07.720 --> 48:10.160
loves this job, it's her life, and, uh...

48:11.280 --> 48:13.720
she's always cherished the work
that she does...

48:15.280 --> 48:17.280
bringing literature to life and...

48:17.880 --> 48:19.960
encouraging you lot
to fall in love with...

48:20.360 --> 48:22.440
language, words.

48:23.800 --> 48:26.960
And as her husband, her passion and...

48:27.600 --> 48:29.120
belief in what she does

48:29.200 --> 48:30.760
is something that I've...

48:31.400 --> 48:33.080
always deeply admired.

48:34.320 --> 48:36.160
But I will give this to her

48:36.240 --> 48:39.040
and she can come and tell you herself
when she feels better.

48:39.120 --> 48:40.000
Cheers.

48:56.400 --> 48:57.600
Think she'll be at home?

48:58.120 --> 48:59.200
I don't know.

49:00.720 --> 49:02.640
-How can you not know where she is?
-Well, do you?

49:05.360 --> 49:06.560
Sorry, mate.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.160
It's fine, okay?

49:09.120 --> 49:11.880
Mom just didn't feel up to it tonight.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Now you know she's a liar.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.440
There's more to this.
