09:58.760 --> 10:01.320
Sprayed it all over me
and my boys.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.800
I did what I had to do.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.240
That how you wound up
with that cut?

10:06.320 --> 10:07.520
He did what he had to do.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.800
No hard feelings.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.160
Lil' Rex's bodyguard,
Tyler McCraig,

10:10.240 --> 10:12.920
was shot dead this morning.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.440
Where were you at 6:00am?

10:16.520 --> 10:18.360
Riding with my crew.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.840
Blue Light Studios?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.200
No.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.200
Hangin' in that big ass park.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.680
Any people in your crew
not on your payroll see you?

10:26.760 --> 10:29.160
All I need.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.800
We'll see about that.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.320
His crew are just boys
riding his coattails.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.440
These guys bring up their
friends when they make it.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.840
Not Rex, he cut and run on DB.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.360
Yeah.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.680
DB made him a star and
Lil' Rex left him behind.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.040
DB's acting fine but I bet those
wounds go deep.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.760
Ah, man.

10:58.840 --> 11:02.720
Bad blood, run-in at the club,
a fight breaks out,

11:02.800 --> 11:04.160
emotions high.

11:04.240 --> 11:07.240
The question is,
what does DB do next?

11:07.320 --> 11:09.160
Take the high road or take
a shot at the guy

11:09.240 --> 11:11.560
who betrayed him?

11:11.640 --> 11:13.600
We gotta look into DB's story.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.400
But what I still don't get
is that if Rex knows

11:16.480 --> 11:21.600
that DB tried to kill him, why
is he covering for his rival?

11:21.680 --> 11:24.720
In '96 a shooter put
four bullets in Tupac

11:24.800 --> 11:26.720
outside the MGM Grand.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.000
First responder was a bike cop.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.680
Keeps asking Tupac
"who shot you?"

11:31.760 --> 11:33.720
You know what his
last words were?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.840
Hmm.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.520
I can think of two.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.120
One started with an F.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.840
Yeah, he took the killer's
identity to the grave

11:40.920 --> 11:42.680
rather than help the police.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.520
But if he lived...

11:44.600 --> 11:47.080
He would have handled
it himself.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.480
It's gone far enough.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.440
What're you gonna do?

11:54.520 --> 11:55.800
Talk to him.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.960
He's never gonna forgive you.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.520
The sooner you accept that
the sooner you can ignore him.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.000
I know how he thinks, ok?

12:02.080 --> 12:03.440
He'll listen to me.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.880
He tried to gun you down
outside the studio.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.280
That's not someone
who can be reasonable.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.880
And if I don't take care
of this, who will?

12:07.960 --> 12:11.160
You go there, Rex,
and this ends one way.

12:11.240 --> 12:17.280
One of you dead.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.680
How'd it come to this?

12:18.760 --> 12:22.960
I don't know, but you gotta
let it go.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.280
Hey.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.000
DB's story about the fight
at the club checks out.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.600
Still trying to figure out
where he went afterwords...

12:39.680 --> 12:41.320
And you found something.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.720
Lil' Rex recently served DB
with a Statement of Claim.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.240
He's suing him for ownership
of old songs they worked on.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.080
That gives us a why now.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.440
DB gets pissed off,
settles it with a gun.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.640
Any headway?

12:53.720 --> 12:55.240
Diss tracks, legal threats.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.800
Lil' Rex and DB really
hate each other.

12:56.880 --> 12:57.840
Legal threats.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.880
Wow, hip hop has changed.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.000
Add money and stir.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.400
Yeah, right?

13:01.480 --> 13:02.520
I mean, all these guys
do is trash each other,

13:02.600 --> 13:03.440
especially in the media.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.240
It's part of the game.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.680
It's not unheard of for these
things to escalate to violence.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.520
Or shooting Tyler
is a publicity stunt.

13:08.600 --> 13:09.600
Sells records, right?

13:09.680 --> 13:11.200
It does happen.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.240
DB seemed genuinely hurt
that Lil' Rex cut him loose.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.440
Ok, let's figure out if this
beef is for real

13:15.520 --> 13:16.960
before we waste
any more time on it.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.520
We need to find out

13:18.600 --> 13:19.920
who would want to shoot
Lil Rex or his bodyguard.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.400
There might be another way
in on this,

13:21.480 --> 13:22.960
but it involves
talking to paparazzi.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.560
I don't care where the
information comes from,

13:24.640 --> 13:26.360
just don't pay for it.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.800
What's your angle?

13:36.520 --> 13:40.120
She's all yours.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.480
I'll give it a go.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.680
I read your coverage on
the Lil' Rex DB Kane feud.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.760
Aren't those things
just a publicity stunt?

13:48.840 --> 13:51.520
Something to sell records
and papers?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.280
A lot of them are,
but not Lil' Rex and DB,

13:53.360 --> 13:54.400
those two mean it.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.120
How can you tell?

13:56.200 --> 13:59.160
You ever watch someone's eyes
when you interview them?

13:59.240 --> 14:01.160
You get used to the look
of a lie.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.720
Don't get this view
from the interview room.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.320
This is nice, Detective Harris.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.240
But I was hoping for a scoop.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.800
Suspect lists,
imminent arrests,

14:14.880 --> 14:16.080
you gonna help me out?

14:16.160 --> 14:17.560
I'll see what I can do.

But I'm gonna need something
from you first

14:19.560 --> 14:21.480

14:24.880 --> 14:28.560
Kenzo is notorious for using
a gun to inspire his artists.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.600
Are you saying Lil' Rex's
producer killed Tyler?

14:31.680 --> 14:34.960
All I know is a gun went off
in the live room at the studio

14:35.040 --> 14:38.040
shortly before the bodyguard
was found.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.080
Who told you that?

14:40.160 --> 14:42.600
I pride myself on my discretion.

14:42.680 --> 14:45.040
How about telling me
who fired the gun?

14:45.120 --> 14:48.520
You got your one freebie.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.240
Are you working the murder of
that rap artist's bodyguard?

14:58.320 --> 15:01.640
You know I can't
talk about my job.

15:01.720 --> 15:07.520
Your father used to confide
in me all the time.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.360
Just be careful.

15:10.440 --> 15:11.800
Careful about what?

15:11.880 --> 15:15.360
I know they don't have
any love for cops.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.480
Did your father ever tell you
what he went through?

15:17.560 --> 15:20.280
How other black people saw him
as a police officer?

15:20.360 --> 15:22.920
He warned me there
would be challenges.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.520

How's the campaign going?

15:49.880 --> 15:51.920
The poles have us behind

16:31.200 --> 16:33.400
I heard there was an altercation

16:33.480 --> 16:34.760
while you were recording.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.000
News to me.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.480
I left early.

16:37.560 --> 16:39.120
There was a shot fired

16:43.520 --> 16:45.200

drinking and working

16:45.280 --> 16:47.040
aren't mutually exclusive
in my field.

Do you usually keep your

17:42.360 --> 17:44.320

17:49.760 --> 17:51.720
The gun belongs to Lil' Rex,
ok?

17:51.800 --> 17:53.960
I had the audacity to critique
his latest track

17:54.040 --> 17:55.160
and he pulled it on me.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.560
He shot at you?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.520
No, I grabbed the gun
and it went off.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.160
I calmed Lil' Rex down and then
I stashed the gun in my desk.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.760
But you waited until now
to tell us this?

18:02.840 --> 18:05.080
If I talked to you about
what goes down in the studio

18:05.160 --> 18:06.960
you think any artist would
ever wanna work with me?

18:07.040 --> 18:08.640
What happens in that room
stays there.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.440
Well, it's too bad you
turned off those cameras.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.960
Now nobody can corroborate
your story

18:12.040 --> 18:15.000
except the man you're accusing.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.480
Turning off the CCTV is bad
but not enough to lay a charge.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.640
So we like the producer now,
what about DB Kane?

If it was already at the studio
before Tyler's death

18:35.880 --> 18:37.360
it rules out DB Kane.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.120
Someone in Rex's entourage
must have fired it.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.880
Guys, Sarah just tipped me
to a Real Scoop video.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.240
Tyler was my brother,
you know what I'm saying?

18:48.320 --> 18:50.360
He was a protector in every
sense of the word.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.600
What was going through your mind when you heard the shots?

18:53.680 --> 18:55.680
I remember thinking this is it.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.040
It was three guys.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.800
We had no chance at all.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.680
Our only eyewitness tells you
that he didn't see anyone

19:00.760 --> 19:04.320

that he saw three guys.

If I took a bullet for you,

19:06.120 --> 19:07.480
I hope you cooperate
with the police.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.120
I would unless I had
something to hide.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.880
I mean, think about it.

19:11.960 --> 19:15.200
I wanna kill my bodyguard so
I shoot him on a smoke break

19:15.280 --> 19:16.760
and then run inside
and sound the alarm.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.200
Yeah, and then he stashes
the gun,

19:18.280 --> 19:20.400
cops arrive, claims
he didn't see anything.

19:20.480 --> 19:21.680
It's a good cover.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.080
Maybe Lil' Rex
wasn't the target.

left and you've unpacked

20:28.880 --> 20:31.440
You left your firearm
in your car unattended.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.480
The gun was stolen
and used in a murder.

20:33.560 --> 20:36.320
And then your ex-partner
tampered with evidence

20:36.400 --> 20:39.640
and then died in your arms.

20:39.720 --> 20:42.600
How are you feeling?

20:42.680 --> 20:47.400
It's a relief to have someone
to confide in,

20:47.480 --> 20:51.440
but it doesn't absolve me.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.280
It's incredibly vulnerable
to let someone else

20:54.360 --> 20:58.000
hear our secrets.

20:58.080 --> 21:02.040
No matter what you share
I'm here to support you.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.440
[ringing]

21:13.520 --> 21:14.360
Hi. What's up?

21:14.440 --> 21:15.120
Hey.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.000
I have a theory.

21:16.080 --> 21:16.720
Can I run it by you?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.320
Sure.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.320
I've been trying to figure out
why you would kill

21:19.400 --> 21:20.520
your own protection.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.680
Why not just fire him?

21:22.760 --> 21:25.880
But then I realized these guys
know everything.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.880
A big part of their job is
keeping their client's secrets

21:28.960 --> 21:30.240
or covering them up.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.560
Mmm.

21:31.640 --> 21:32.760
Help them score drugs,
get them women,

21:32.840 --> 21:34.160
protect them from said women.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.320
Do we have any dirt on Tyler?

21:35.400 --> 21:36.880
Yeah.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.160
He was fined two years ago
for insider trading.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.280
A tip from a CEO
he was protecting.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.480
So he's not above making a quick
buck off a professional secret.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.160
The tabloids live off
this stuff.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.120
Are you thinking our friend
Sarah at The Real Scoop?

21:48.200 --> 21:49.360
You got it.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.840
I'll see what she knows.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.560
-Thanks.
-HmmMmm.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.600
You lost, girl?

22:04.680 --> 22:06.240
We need to talk.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.600
Give us a few.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.120
So this is how it's gonna be

22:18.200 --> 22:19.760
after everything you two
have been through?

22:19.840 --> 22:20.760
What're you talking about?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.920
This has gone too far, ok?

22:23.000 --> 22:27.280
I know you're hurt but you have
to work this out some other way.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.520
Of all people I can't believe
he'd send his girlfriend.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.600
[knocking]

22:53.360 --> 22:54.600
Where's your brother?

22:54.680 --> 22:55.600
He's out.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.200
He didn't say where.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.560
[ding]

23:22.120 --> 23:24.120
Stop!

23:24.200 --> 23:25.280
[gun clatters]

23:48.200 --> 23:49.520
Don't move!

23:49.600 --> 23:51.200
Raise your hands!

23:51.280 --> 23:53.560
You wanna kill a brother?

23:53.640 --> 23:54.320
Now's your chance.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.920
Go on.

24:02.800 --> 24:03.800
Kate!

24:03.880 --> 24:05.920
He's unarmed.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.640
It's your move.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.360
You enjoy working for the man?

24:35.440 --> 24:36.840
My dad was a cop.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.760
Must be real proud then, huh?

24:38.840 --> 24:40.240
He's dead.

24:40.320 --> 24:43.080
Killed on the job.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.360
Let's go.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.680
Hey, have a good one.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.120
You buy information.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.320
What's valuable?

25:01.400 --> 25:03.160
Anything that destroys a brand.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.920
Family man with a side piece,

25:05.000 --> 25:06.880
Christian pop star
with a meth habit,

25:06.960 --> 25:09.200
America's sweetheart
caught in a nasty sex tape.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.320
Monetizing shame.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.160
The more sordid the better.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.960
I got a suspect with a pair
of handcuffs in his future.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.360
How'd you like to be
my first call?

25:16.440 --> 25:17.280
What do you want?

25:17.360 --> 25:18.960
What do you got?

25:19.040 --> 25:20.400
A week ago an anonymous source
offered something big

25:20.480 --> 25:22.200
about Lil' Rex for $250K.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.000
They went silent before
my publisher signed off

25:24.080 --> 25:27.080
on the money.

25:27.160 --> 25:28.200
That's something.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.960
Mmmhmm.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.360
We tie the gun Rex had
to the murder?

25:34.440 --> 25:36.760
At first blush it
looks like a match.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.000
Forensics is checking it
against bullets recovered

25:39.080 --> 25:40.640
at the crime scene.

25:40.720 --> 25:43.280
I should do this one.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.600
Let's use all the tools we got.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.680
Tyler was a lot like a cop.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.120
He risked his life for you.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.760
You're looking to make
me good for this.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.320
Lawrence Kenzo says you
fired a shot in the live room.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.360
That it was your gun.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.280
He's a liar.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.760
Maybe.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.440
But that gun killed Tyler.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.920
And your prints are on it.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.400
So are Lawrence's.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.320
He doesn't have a motive.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.240
Tyler knew everything about you,
all your secrets,

26:21.320 --> 26:23.920
realized he could make money
on the side but you found out.

26:24.000 --> 26:24.840
Mmm-mmm.

26:24.920 --> 26:25.760
That didn't happen.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.240
That would never happen.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.600
Tyler wasn't that guy.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.520
You were carrying
the murder weapon.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.840
I never shot anyone.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.680
The gun belonged to DB.

26:54.760 --> 26:57.320
Tyler took it off him
at the club.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.560
What's DB got to do with this?

26:58.640 --> 27:00.280
Nothing.

27:00.360 --> 27:01.600
We were tight once.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.160
That was a different life.

27:03.240 --> 27:04.480
That's over now.

27:04.560 --> 27:05.880
But you were carrying
his gun around?

27:05.960 --> 27:07.960
I didn't know it was
the murder weapon.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.360
Tyler's dead.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.480
I figured someone's trying
to kill me.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.960
I need it for protection.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.080
Why did you tell us you didn't
see the shooter

27:14.160 --> 27:16.640
yet you told a reporter
there were three guys?

27:16.720 --> 27:19.720
I told her what she wanted
to hear.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.680
So you really don't know
who did this?

27:40.800 --> 27:43.360
Entertain Rex's story
for a second.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.320
You said it was DB's gun.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.600
Rex and DB get in a fight
at the club.

27:50.680 --> 27:53.600
Tyler takes DB's gun
to save Lil' Rex.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.920
Then Lil' Rex takes the gun
off Tyler

27:55.000 --> 27:57.400
and goes to the recording
studio.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.680
Lawrence Kenzo trashes Lil'
Rex's work and it sets him off.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.800
He points the gun at Lawrence
in the live room,

28:02.880 --> 28:04.480
Lawrence tries to take it
from him,

28:04.560 --> 28:06.120
the gun goes off.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.440
Then Kenzo hides it in a drawer.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.720
Like a hot potato.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.000
Nice catch.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.320
Whoever killed Tyler knew
where Kenzo stashed that gun.

28:14.400 --> 28:18.000
The only two people there that
night were Takira and Ayana.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.280
I pulled security footage
from DB's hotel.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.960
You're gonna wanna see these.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.960
What's Rex's girlfriend Ayana
doing with DB Kane?

28:27.040 --> 28:28.280
Maybe she's cheating
on Lil' Rex.

28:28.360 --> 28:29.800
Is that a story we're selling?

28:29.880 --> 28:32.600
Sarah says a high profile
love triangle is gold.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.600
So Tyler tries to leak
the information,

28:34.680 --> 28:36.720
Lil' Rex finds out and gets
pissed at the betrayal.

28:36.800 --> 28:40.000
Maybe Lil' Rex and DB's beef
isn't professional,

28:40.080 --> 28:42.320
it's personal.

28:42.400 --> 28:46.320
You coming after me now, too?

28:46.400 --> 28:48.400
Do you need some water for that?

28:48.480 --> 28:49.880
That'd be great.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.080
There's a glass in the bathroom.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.160
I got it.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.320
It's a nice place.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.160
Thanks.

28:59.240 --> 29:03.240
You like it here- I mean you
and Lil' Rex?

29:03.320 --> 29:06.320
Yeah, it's fine.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.680
[snap]

29:22.880 --> 29:25.520
How far along are you?

29:25.600 --> 29:27.440
Thirteen weeks.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.320
How do you know that?

29:29.400 --> 29:32.160
My wife took these pills
for morning sickness

29:32.240 --> 29:34.640
with our first kid.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.280
So you just started
telling people then?

29:36.360 --> 29:37.440
Last week.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.160
Our families.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.800
Tyler.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.280
Someone tried to sell a gossip
item about Lil' Rex

29:42.360 --> 29:44.440
around the same time.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.120
It's worth a quarter
of a million dollars.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.600
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.480
It's Takira's job to manage
the press.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.400
Tell us about your meeting
with DB.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.560
We know you met with him
at his hotel.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.640
Is he the father?

29:55.720 --> 29:56.680
You're kidding me?

29:56.760 --> 29:58.120
You think I'm with DB?

29:58.200 --> 30:00.920
Secret meetings with
your boyfriend's rival?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.160
You tell me.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.160
Lil' Rex isn't
just my baby daddy.

30:04.240 --> 30:05.920
He's my partner.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.600
We tell each other everything.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.480
Then why is DB Kane's ring
on your bathroom counter?

30:09.560 --> 30:11.400
That's Rex's.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.600
What's the "D" stand for?

30:14.680 --> 30:16.360
Doomstown.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.200
They go way back.

30:18.280 --> 30:19.520
Grew up in the same hood.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.280
DB says it stands
for his name.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.800
David.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.640
That's because they don't
get along anymore.

30:24.720 --> 30:25.960
It's complicated.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.080
If Takira manages the press
she'd have gotten wind

30:32.160 --> 30:33.680
of the story for sale.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.080
Yet said nothing to her brother.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.520
Which means she's either
protecting him

30:36.600 --> 30:38.640
or hiding something.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.120
Did you see Ayana's reaction
when I mentioned the rings?

30:41.200 --> 30:42.720
Mmmhmm.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.000
Hey, uh, DB Kane was wearing
the exact same ring

30:44.080 --> 30:45.320
when I saw him
at the restaurant.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.800
D for Doomstown.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.080
Something's going on.

30:48.160 --> 30:49.880
What're you thinking?

30:49.960 --> 30:51.280
One of them's lying.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.840
But why?

30:52.920 --> 30:56.640
I don't see a pregnant Ayana
killing Lil' Rex.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.920
Yeah.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.440
That only leaves Takira.

31:10.760 --> 31:14.440
Took us 20 minutes
from the 24-hour diner

31:14.520 --> 31:16.960
and back to the studio.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.840
Well, Takira called
in the order at 5:50

31:18.920 --> 31:20.640
as she was walking out the door.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.960
Tyler was shot at 6:03 and she
was paying for the food by 6:14.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.400
That's 11 minutes.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.400
Not enough time for Takira
to shoot Tyler

31:27.480 --> 31:28.840
and make it back to
the take-out counter.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.720
Her alibi is good.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.560
You know what this burger needs?

31:33.640 --> 31:36.320
A beer.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.680
We're on duty.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.680
Yeah, it's a real problem.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.160
Nolan.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.640
There's no traffic at 6:00
in the morning.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.960
It's a straight shot from
the burger joint to here.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.400
You're right.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.040
Takira could have
made it back in time.

31:51.120 --> 31:56.880
But how'd she get the gun back
in the office?

31:56.960 --> 31:59.600
Walked it right through
the front door.

32:06.120 --> 32:08.440
We need something for
questioning, any ideas.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.440
They've had Rex's sister
in holding for an hour.

32:10.520 --> 32:11.920
We had the right motive,
the leak,

32:12.000 --> 32:13.960
but the wrong person selling
the information.

32:14.040 --> 32:17.080
The question is why would she
try to sell out her brother?

32:17.160 --> 32:18.800
She's had quite
a checkered past.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.440
In and out of juvie-

32:20.520 --> 32:22.080
Rex has been bailing her
out of trouble for years.

32:22.160 --> 32:25.240
Tech crimes found a voice memo
on Takira Green's phone.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.040
I didn't believe it at first
but it confirms your theory.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.520
Wait 'til you hear it.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.960
Lil' Rex is the only family
I got.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.440
We take care of each other.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.240
He's starting a new life
with Ayana.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.640
How do you fit
into the new family?

32:42.720 --> 32:44.440
Me and my brother are tight.

32:44.520 --> 32:48.400
I'm happy for him.

32:48.480 --> 32:51.120
Until you found out he was
planning on letting you go.

32:51.200 --> 32:55.680
I understand he's looking
for a new manager.

32:55.760 --> 33:01.320
We know Rex was unhappy
with his record deal.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.560
He also has a new family
to look out for.

33:03.640 --> 33:06.560
Suddenly, you're
feeling left behind.

33:06.640 --> 33:11.120
That's why you wanted
to blow up his life.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.640
That's why you recorded him.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.600
I can't believe you'd do this.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.280
After everything
he's done for you.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.920
You took my phone?

33:19.000 --> 33:21.200
This would destroy him.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.840
It's not what you think.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.840
That reporter asked me
about a story on the market.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.880
And you, you of all people.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.680
Give me my phone!

33:29.760 --> 33:31.240
Why can't you accept the fact
they're out of your league?

33:31.320 --> 33:32.880
Rex is tired, ok?

33:32.960 --> 33:34.160
He needs a break.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.400
He's hired a new manager,
Takira.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.800
He's the new king of the six.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.640
He needs proper management.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.080
I'm the only one
who understands him.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.040
He can't just drop me.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.520
You know what?

33:44.600 --> 33:45.880
It's time for you to leave.

33:45.960 --> 33:46.760
Tyler-

33:46.840 --> 33:50.000
It's over. You're done.

33:50.080 --> 33:53.560
You're gonna tell Rex
you're in way over your head.

33:53.640 --> 33:56.560
And that you agree he needs
someone with more experience

33:56.640 --> 33:58.080
to manage him.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.080
And then you're gonna be
on your way.

34:01.160 --> 34:05.880
You do that, this goes
to the grave with me.

34:05.960 --> 34:10.320
You don't, I'm gonna
tell him everything.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.280
Your choice.

34:16.400 --> 34:19.480
And I emailed a copy of that
to myself.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.720
We found what you were going
to leak.

34:32.800 --> 34:33.720
A new chain?

34:33.800 --> 34:35.680
You like it?

34:35.760 --> 34:38.000
You make it look good.

34:38.080 --> 34:40.360
I've been thinking about that
time we hid out in the cabin,

34:40.440 --> 34:42.120
working on your demo.

34:42.200 --> 34:43.920
Hey, hey! What're you
doing, D?

34:44.000 --> 34:45.720
You want me to leave?

34:45.800 --> 34:47.120
Just say it.

34:47.200 --> 34:49.640
I love Ayana.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.080
You know I can't hurt her.

34:52.160 --> 34:54.240
I know.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.800
But I miss us.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.800
I still love you.

35:02.200 --> 35:06.120
Your brother and DB Kane
were a couple.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.240
And when Tyler found out
you were trying to sell

35:08.320 --> 35:10.960
their relationship
to The Real Scoop

35:11.040 --> 35:13.840
you knew you had to get rid
of him.

35:15.280 --> 35:19.320
I'm outta here.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.760
Nobody pulls a gun on me!

35:21.840 --> 35:22.600
Aye.

35:22.680 --> 35:23.640
Aye!

35:24.920 --> 35:27.320
Yo, let's just take 15, eh?

35:27.400 --> 35:29.480
Yo, you mind if I grab a smoke?

35:29.560 --> 35:30.760
Yeah.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.520
You want me to make
a food run?

35:32.600 --> 35:36.040
Yeah, grab me one of those bacon
and egg things I like, huh?

35:47.560 --> 35:50.000
We know when you called in
your food order

35:50.080 --> 35:52.040
and we know when
you picked it up.

35:52.120 --> 35:56.680
You used that trip as your alibi
but we retraced your steps.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.840
You had enough time
to shoot Tyler,

35:58.920 --> 36:02.080
do your run, and come back
in through the front door.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.160
And you had to delete
the email off his phone

36:04.240 --> 36:05.720
so there would be no evidence.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.000
[banging]

36:07.080 --> 36:08.200
Tyler!

36:08.280 --> 36:09.280
[banging]

36:09.360 --> 36:12.080
Tyler!

36:17.560 --> 36:20.480
All you could see was Tyler
lighting a cigarette.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.520
Lil' Rex wasn't supposed
to be outside, was he?

36:22.600 --> 36:25.640
He quit smoking when he
found out Ayana was pregnant.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.920
You were so obsessed
with getting rid of Tyler

36:28.000 --> 36:29.320
you nearly killed
your brother.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.320
Tyler was gonna tear us apart!

36:35.320 --> 36:38.120
You did that all on your own.

I thought about what you said
and you're right.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.280
We almost lost him.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.200
I can't fight anymore.

37:43.280 --> 37:46.240
I want you both to be happy.

37:46.320 --> 37:50.200
I want Rex to be happy.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.760
They're releasing him
right now.

37:52.840 --> 37:57.400
Misdemeanour gun charge.

37:57.480 --> 38:01.400
He still loves you.

38:01.480 --> 38:05.160
But he chose you.

There's some out
underground rappers.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.520
There's Cakes Da Killa,
Rose, iLoveMakonnen

39:07.600 --> 39:09.360
is probably the biggest name.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.440
Yeah, but iLoveMakonnen didn't
come out until he was famous.

39:10.520 --> 39:11.880
Same with Frank Ocean.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.200
Frank Ocean's not hip hop,
it's more R&B.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.000
Give it time.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.480
Lil' Rex might be the first out
rapper at home in the top 40.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.440
I thought these two guys
hated each other.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.120
Who's cheating on who
in this scenario?

39:21.200 --> 39:23.360
What if no one is?

39:23.440 --> 39:24.800
Lil' Rex is with Ayana.

39:24.880 --> 39:25.840
Mmmhmm.

39:25.920 --> 39:26.800
But he's also with DB Kane.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.880
Yeah.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.280
How does that work?

39:29.360 --> 39:30.200
Kids do relationships
differently now.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.960
Especially queer kids.

39:32.040 --> 39:35.040
They're just figuring out
what works for them.

39:35.120 --> 39:35.600
See you tomorrow.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.160
Bye.

39:37.240 --> 39:40.800
My marriage suddenly seems
a lot less complicated.

39:40.880 --> 39:43.520
Leah and I have been
having problems.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.680
I've been staying at the motel.

39:46.760 --> 39:51.200
I suspected as much.

39:51.280 --> 39:54.360
I think it might be over.

39:54.440 --> 39:57.480
I wasn't exactly
the perfect husband.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.320
You should tell her that.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.320
Yeah.

40:03.400 --> 40:08.680
I probably should.

40:08.760 --> 40:12.000
Remember that case we had
with the dead audiologist?

40:12.080 --> 40:14.040
Evan Walker.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.520
Sent a murder ballad
to his victim.

40:16.600 --> 40:20.320
I've received a few weird texts
with audio files.

40:20.400 --> 40:28.200
One with music, another one
of me with a guy I was seeing.

40:28.280 --> 40:32.440
A sex tape?

40:32.520 --> 40:34.920
You tell this guy you're seeing
about the Walker case?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.600
I never talk about work.

40:36.680 --> 40:37.800
Walker's locked up.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.080
He can't get to you.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.800
It must be some sort of
weird fluke.

40:41.880 --> 40:45.840
You need help straightening
this guy out?

40:45.920 --> 40:47.680
No, I took care of it.

40:49.880 --> 40:50.840
But thanks.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.920
Are you good?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.120
Yeah.

40:57.200 --> 41:00.080
I'm good.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.280
See you tomorrow, Nolan.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.560
Thanks.
