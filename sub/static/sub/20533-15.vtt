two talked and decided

that you're going to do
your own things?

03:54.943 --> 03:56.820
Yeah, but I'm guessing that
Silver's idea

03:56.862 --> 03:59.322
of me doing my own thing is,
like, going to school

04:39.404 --> 04:41.364
Ooh, here's something we can do

04:41.406 --> 04:43.992
How about mobile
pet grooming-slash-psychic?

04:44.034 --> 04:45.244
Is that actually a thing?

04:45.285 --> 04:46.245

04:46.286 --> 04:48.663

Okay, well we'll keep thinking.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.330
Oh, my God.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.249
Naomi, what's
on your legs?

05:32.291 --> 05:34.168
Is that denim?
So working-class.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.544
Next thing you know,
she'll be wearing scrunchies.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.840
I am too tired
to insult you back.

05:39.881 --> 05:43.426
Guys, I volunteered to help Mark
unload supplies

05:43.468 --> 05:45.428
at the Offshore this morning.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.972
And when I get there,
he practically

05:47.014 --> 05:49.183
forced me to unpack everything
for the restaurant opening.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.600
Weird.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.270
You'd think he'd know "unload
supplies" really means

05:53.312 --> 05:55.396
hang out and get to know your
long lost sister better.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.316
Yeah, I know.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.650
I've been following
him around for a week,

05:58.692 --> 06:00.068
and I don't even know his
apron size.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.112
Naomi, the restaurant
opens in a couple of days.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.780
You guys haven't even had
a chance to breathe,

06:03.822 --> 06:04.865
much less bond.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.825
The whole point of doing the
restaurant thing

06:06.867 --> 06:08.743
was so we get to know each other
like family

06:08.785 --> 06:11.621
without all the crazy baggage I
have with my mom and Jen.

06:11.663 --> 06:15.334
We're nothing like family at all
right now; we're co-workers.

06:15.374 --> 06:17.336
So, why don't you try to get
together outside of work?

06:17.376 --> 06:19.504
He lives in a
place called Sylmar.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.340
I don't even know
if that's in California.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.719
Wait, why does my brother live
in a crappy apartment

06:25.760 --> 06:27.386
when I own
an eight-bedroom mansion?

06:27.428 --> 06:29.056
Can you imagine
how close we'd be

06:29.097 --> 06:30.431
if he lived right down the hall?

06:30.473 --> 06:31.933
I cannot hang out with you guys.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.352
I have to move Mark in

06:33.392 --> 06:35.687
with the sister of his dreams.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.151
(sighs)

06:43.153 --> 06:45.280
Okay, my next book
is going to be about

06:45.322 --> 06:48.200
the psychological torture of
watching someone read your work.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.451
It's very good.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.829
(sighs)
Uh, thank God.

06:52.871 --> 06:56.083
It's
sexy and real

06:56.124 --> 06:57.751
and surprising.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.254
That twist
where Annabelle fantasizes

07:00.295 --> 07:02.256
about having an
affair with her roommate,

07:02.297 --> 07:03.924
I did not see that coming.

07:03.965 --> 07:07.052
Yeah, that just
kind of came to me recently.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.263
Everyone in the office is
talking about your story, Annie.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.390
We can't wait
to see how it ends.

07:11.431 --> 07:16.061
Oh, um,
actually, that is the end.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.646
I mean, it's based on me,
and that's what really happened.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.900
Which would make a perfect
ending to your diary;

07:21.942 --> 07:24.903
perhaps my career in publishing.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.989
But this is not the end
to the best-selling

07:28.031 --> 07:31.368
erotic adventure novel that hits
book shelves in one month.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.287
That feels soon.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.205
I know I am
not the writer here,

07:35.247 --> 07:37.498
but can I pitch you something?

07:39.251 --> 07:43.380
What if this is
not a book about sex?

07:43.422 --> 07:45.590
What if this is
a book about love?

07:45.632 --> 07:46.758
You want me to cut out the sex?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.343
No.

07:48.385 --> 07:51.888
Maybe your ending just needs
to go a little deeper.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.142
Maybe Annabelle realizes
her sexual adventures

07:55.183 --> 07:57.518
are merely masking
her feelings for Leo.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.520
I mean, she did
take a bullet for him.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.565
(awkward laugh)
I think you misread my work.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.777
But Annabelle and Leo
feel so right.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.070
They aren't.

08:07.112 --> 08:10.031
Trust me, Annabelle has been
down that road before,

08:10.073 --> 08:11.699
and it was not a happy ending.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.329
Annie, I
know this is

08:15.370 --> 08:17.497
completely personal.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.833
But writing, you
know, a lot like life,

08:19.874 --> 08:21.418
is a search for truth.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.338
If there are feelings
this book has brought up

08:24.379 --> 08:25.922
that you're avoiding,

08:25.964 --> 08:28.216
you're going to
have to face them.

08:29.301 --> 08:30.385
(clears throat)

08:30.427 --> 08:35.056
Well, um, thanks for the
suggestion, Amanda,

08:35.097 --> 08:37.476
but it's my story.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.601
Annie...

08:40.602 --> 08:42.438
I suggest you figure out
how it ends.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.028

09:02.959 --> 09:04.169
CAMPBELL:
Navid, wait up.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.628
I need a favor.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.587
Oh, dude, are you serious?

09:06.629 --> 09:07.630
Yeah.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.717
Final exam's bad enough,
all right?

09:10.758 --> 09:12.219
Right now I couldn't help you

09:12.260 --> 09:13.303
without getting an ulcer.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.638
Look, I know
helping us out on that test

09:15.680 --> 09:16.639
made you uncomfortable.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.475
I promise,
that was a one-time thing.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.727
Okay, cool.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.312
Uh, what's
the favor?

09:22.354 --> 09:24.022
All right, six
months ago I got engaged

09:24.064 --> 09:25.732
to a great girl named Sonja.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.401
Problem is,
seven months ago,

09:27.442 --> 09:29.777
I broke up with a
crazy ex named Elise.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.113
She keeps calling me
and wants to meet tonight

09:32.155 --> 09:34.324
to get closure on
our relationship.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.117
Well, it sounds like
you moved on pretty fast.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.327
Really, Mom?

09:37.369 --> 09:38.328
(chuckling)

09:38.370 --> 09:39.704
Oh, sorry, I get it.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.915
I've had my share
of complications
with ex-girlfriends.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.666
Okay, then you understand
that I have to talk to the ex?

09:43.708 --> 09:44.751
One please.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.504
But Sonja has
tickets to some event

09:47.546 --> 09:50.257
and I obviously don't
want to blow her off.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.509
So, can you help me out?

09:52.551 --> 09:55.387
Okay, but you could
be making a mistake

09:55.429 --> 09:57.222
sending me on a
date with your fiancée.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.473
I am pretty charming.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.142
Actually, that's
why I'm asking you.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.437
Sonja's always
getting hit on by douchebags.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.064
You're cool, she'll
like hanging out with you.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.024
Plus, you're one of
the only guys I trust.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.359
Really?

10:09.401 --> 10:11.736
Yeah, you have integrity.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.321
I wasn't going
to mention this yet,

10:13.363 --> 10:15.823
but after I graduate,
Cronus is going to need somebody

10:15.865 --> 10:16.950
to step up and lead.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.743
I was thinking
of recommending you.

10:18.785 --> 10:22.372
Wha... Wow, seriously?

10:22.414 --> 10:24.124
Absolutely.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.586
Brothers helping brothers
is what Cronus is all about.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.548
MICHAELA:
♪ I can be your shining star ♪

10:31.590 --> 10:33.425
♪ I will follow ♪

10:33.467 --> 10:34.884
♪ No matter where you are... ♪

10:34.926 --> 10:36.428
Hey.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.305
Oh, um, Silver.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.348
I thought you
were coming by later.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.560
Oh, yeah, well, I thought
I'd be out working on the truck.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.186
Turns out, to get a business up
and running you should probably

10:45.228 --> 10:47.272
(turns off music)
have an idea of what
business to up and run.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.316
Wait, you guys still don't
have an idea?

10:49.357 --> 10:51.318
No, and every idea
we come up with

10:51.359 --> 10:52.819
somehow is worse than the last.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.821
In summary, I have

10:54.862 --> 10:57.532
no career,
no direction

10:57.574 --> 10:58.783
and really no prospects.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.868
What did you want
to talk to me about?

11:00.910 --> 11:03.955
Oh, about people
and their dreams,

11:03.997 --> 11:07.041
but... we totally shouldn't
talk about that right now.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.751
Um... hey,
how about

11:08.793 --> 11:10.253
I help you brainstorm, huh?

11:10.295 --> 11:12.255
On the truck? Yeah.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.633
Yeah. Um, you know,
maybe you guys

11:14.673 --> 11:16.675
need to stop thinking
so businesslike

11:16.717 --> 11:20.138
and use the truck
to chase down your dreams.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.600
Like, ever since I've known you,
you wanted to be a filmmaker.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.477
Yeah, but...
what does that have to do

11:25.519 --> 11:27.521
with a former food truck?
It could be

11:27.562 --> 11:29.814
your own movie studio on wheels.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.733
What, we'd, like...
roll around town

11:32.775 --> 11:34.902
getting on-the-spot interviews?

11:34.944 --> 11:37.280
Ade's really good on camera.
She is.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.990
(phone ringing)
A documentary truck.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.660
I can't believe
I didn't think of that.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.952
Yeah, see?
Like I always say,

11:42.994 --> 11:44.287
every dream
takes the first step.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.122
Like, uh, take Michaela,
for instance...
Hey.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.081
Sorry, it's Ade.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.625
Yes. New idea.

11:48.667 --> 11:49.668
I'm gonna tell her everything.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.085
You're a genius.
Thank you.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.672
Okay. I just
talked to Dixon.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.756
What do you think
about this?

11:55.798 --> 11:57.467
So, what if we...

12:01.680 --> 12:02.763
Thanks for letting me
crash here.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.098
The commute
to the restaurant
was killing me.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.184
Hey, what are,
uh, half sisters for?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.687
Besides, a roommate
is just what Liam and I need

12:08.727 --> 12:11.314
to break up the, um...

12:11.356 --> 12:12.899
the monotony.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.693
Go ahead.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.780
You brother-stealing
little bitch.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.701
You pack Mark's things up,
and you send him to
my house right now.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.452
Oh, I can't do that;
I need him here.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.579
You need him?

12:25.620 --> 12:27.497
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm the one who found him.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.082
I'm the one who
begged him to stay.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.626
I'm the one who invested
a fortune into his
restaurant opening,

12:31.668 --> 12:33.587
so that I could develop
a relationship with
the long-lost brother

12:33.628 --> 12:36.214
you didn't want anything
to do with, so please
tell me why you need him.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.757
Look, I didn't know
you were gonna ask him
to move in with you

12:38.799 --> 12:41.802
when I invited him
to live here, but...
I need him as a buffer.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.680
As a...

12:43.722 --> 12:45.390
Hi.
(laughs)
Hey.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.475
A buffer from what?

12:47.517 --> 12:49.810
(sighs)
Hey.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.229
Door's fixed.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.980
I'm gonna head down
to the Offshore

12:53.022 --> 12:55.483
and help out Mark
a little bit, but
we'll be back.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.236
Your turn to
do laundry.
(both laugh)

12:58.278 --> 13:00.405
Bye, Liam.
See ya.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.785
Oh, I get it-- you have
the hots for Liam.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.663
Well, uh, look at him!

13:08.705 --> 13:10.540
What am I
supposed to do?

13:10.582 --> 13:12.791
Jump his bones six ways
to laundry day.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.793
I can't, okay?
Liam and I are friends

13:14.835 --> 13:16.837
and roommates--
we're finally in a good place,

13:16.879 --> 13:18.214
and sex would totally ruin that.

13:18.256 --> 13:21.092
And besides, it's always a huge
mistake to sleep with an ex.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.136
Unless you don't want him
to be an ex anymore,

13:23.177 --> 13:24.803
in which case it's called
getting back together.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.723
Oh, no, that can't work.
Unless it can.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.933
Not if it's not what I want.
Unless it is.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.228
Naomi, stop. I am
under a huge amount
of pressure right now

13:32.270 --> 13:34.981
to finish this project,
and all I want is to stop

13:35.022 --> 13:36.733
being distracted
by Liam's torso!

13:36.775 --> 13:38.109
Mark moving in

13:38.151 --> 13:41.070
may not be the best plan, but...

13:41.112 --> 13:42.739
unless Liam gets really fat

13:42.781 --> 13:44.073
or my mom
comes into town,

13:44.115 --> 13:45.450
it's the only one I've got.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.994
So find a different way
to get to know your new brother.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.704
Mark's staying here.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.626
MARK:
We squeezed in

13:54.668 --> 13:56.461
two extra tables--
not bad.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.046
Thanks for your help.
Oh. Thank Annie.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.965
She gave me a lecture

14:01.007 --> 14:04.218
about not sitting around
waiting for life to happen.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.804
I usually tune her out, but...

14:05.844 --> 14:08.055
something she said
just stuck in my head.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.350
Hey, what's going on with
these empty beer vats?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.851
I was gonna try
to get a brew going
before the opening.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.270
But I'm not gonna have time.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.730
Oh, yeah? Hmm.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.274
I was actually playing around
brewing my own beer

14:18.316 --> 14:19.776
before the bar burned
down. Brewed about

14:19.818 --> 14:21.486
a keg of it--
just needs to be bottled.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.863
Why don't you try out
a small batch at the opening?

14:23.904 --> 14:25.573
People like it,
the vats are yours.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.367
Seriously?

14:28.951 --> 14:31.830
Yeah, I... I've got
that small space downstairs.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.124
I-I... I guess if it works out,
I could actually...

14:35.166 --> 14:36.793
open my own micro-brewery.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.169
Make it happen, bro.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.588
All right, yeah.
Thanks, that'd be great.

14:42.507 --> 14:45.635
Hey. That half brother
of yours, he's a keeper.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.053
Um...

14:49.389 --> 14:51.891
Looks like you and Liam
are bonding

14:51.932 --> 14:53.893
like you're related and have
known each other forever.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.144
Just getting
some help setting up.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.688
It's hard to believe,
but I think

14:56.730 --> 14:58.773
we might actually be ready
for this opening tomorrow night.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.108
Good. Because tomorrow
you and I are spending

15:01.150 --> 15:03.110
the entire day together,

15:03.152 --> 15:06.322
outside the restaurant.
I don't know,
there's still a ton of details.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.615
No, there's not.

15:07.657 --> 15:08.908
I handled everything.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.243
I'm really excited
about us

15:10.284 --> 15:11.494
opening this restaurant
together, but...

15:11.536 --> 15:13.996
I want us to be more
than just business partners,

15:14.038 --> 15:17.083
I want it to really feel
like we're family.
Is this because

15:17.124 --> 15:19.126
I called Liam "bro"?
That's just a guy thing,

15:19.168 --> 15:20.712
like slapping each other
on the butt.

15:20.754 --> 15:21.921
Doesn't mean anything.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.006
Getting to know you would...

15:24.048 --> 15:25.508
mean something to me.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.428
Okay. After everything
you've done for me,

15:28.469 --> 15:30.012
I can do this for you.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.056
Relaxing before the
opening can't hurt.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.933
Yay! Okay,
leave everything up to me.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.309
Tomorrow we make memories.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.770
(laughs)

15:39.188 --> 15:42.233
NAVID:
I hear this hotel
has a great new bar

15:42.275 --> 15:44.903
and since Campbell
is paying for this night,

15:44.944 --> 15:47.988
I say we order a few
very expensive drinks.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.824
Yeah, we're gonna need
them after "An Evening

15:49.866 --> 15:52.034
of Avant-Garde
Russian Theater."

15:52.076 --> 15:54.495
I'm sorry it
was so boring.
What?!

15:54.537 --> 15:56.247
What are you
talking about?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.291
I loved their fresh take
on despair.

15:58.332 --> 16:01.127
(laughs)
Yeah, I'm getting
front-row seats tomorrow night.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.838
Well... assuming
there is a tomorrow.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.508
(laughs)
You know, Campbell said that
you were somebody I should meet,

16:07.550 --> 16:09.218
and I'm really glad I did.

16:09.260 --> 16:12.722
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love all the Cronus guys...

16:12.764 --> 16:15.433
At first I wasn't sure I fit in,
but I'm glad I joined.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.560
And now that I know what
a cool fiancée Campbell has,

16:17.602 --> 16:19.145
you know, I'm starting
to like him more.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.063
Good. Well, why don't
I get those drinks.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.441
And you want to see
if you can get us a table?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.985
Yeah, I'll do that.
Okay.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.622
Hey.

16:53.471 --> 16:57.517
MARK:
Amusement park lines--
not the relaxing day I thought.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.519
You sure you don't want
to go sit in traffic instead?

16:59.560 --> 17:00.854
Come on, this is
something we totally

17:00.895 --> 17:02.271
would've done
if we grew up together.

17:02.313 --> 17:05.316
I thought it'd be a fun way
to get to know each other.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.695
Tell me something
about yourself.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.824
Okay, let's see, uh,
I hate waiting in lines,

17:12.866 --> 17:15.868
I hate talking
about myself,
I love puppies.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.496
Oh. (laughs)

17:18.538 --> 17:20.540
NAOMI: Oh, look-- they
have jumper passes.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.834
You pay a little extra
and you go straight to
the front-- no waiting.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.586
What kind of jerks pay
to skip the line?
Total one-percenter move.

17:25.627 --> 17:29.298
(laughs):
You're right.
That's so not me.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.468
I would never throw
money at a problem.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.428
Is that Marc Jacobs?
I love your sweater.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.223
Uh, actually it's Tom...
Ford?

17:37.264 --> 17:38.265
Tom Ford?

17:38.307 --> 17:40.601
There you go-- we have
something in common.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.978
Good fashion sense.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.771
It's not Tom Ford.
Tom Hegarty.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.690
He had a garage sale
last weekend.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.358
I got this sweater
and a pretty sweet
bowling ball.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.943
Designer clothes are
such a waste of money.

17:48.985 --> 17:52.697
(groans) I couldn't
agree more.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.746
Yo.
Oh, hey.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.623
Hey, Sonja said
she had a great time
with you last night.

18:02.665 --> 18:03.917
Thanks for
helping me out.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.210
Yeah, she was a...
she's a nice girl.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.671
Mm-hmm.
Uh... so, uh,

18:08.713 --> 18:10.381
how did things go
with your ex?

18:10.423 --> 18:11.507
Great. We talked.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.259
She got the closure
she needed.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.761
I even got home early.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.763
Oh, really?
Yep.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.432
So you two just... talked?

18:19.473 --> 18:20.892
Yeah. Yeah.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.476
Hey, listen,
Sonja said

18:22.518 --> 18:24.645
you're going to your friend's
restaurant opening tonight?

18:24.687 --> 18:28.024
Mm-hmm.
She really wants us to go,
too, but I'm busy,

18:28.066 --> 18:29.776
so I can't make it,
and I was wondering

18:29.817 --> 18:31.485
if maybe you could
keep an eye on her,

18:31.527 --> 18:33.738
since you're gonna
be there anyway?
Where are you gonna be?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.950
In my room-- I have a ton
of homework to catch up on.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.994
Even the head of Cronus
has to take a break from
all the socializing

18:40.036 --> 18:41.913
and crack a book every
once in a while.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.957
Pretty soon you'll know
exactly what I'm talking about,

18:43.998 --> 18:45.165
Mr. Future Head of Cronus.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.334
Eh. (chuckles)
Thanks, man.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.461
I owe you, all right?

18:48.502 --> 18:50.296
Yeah, okay.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.507
(sighs)

18:54.467 --> 18:55.760
ADRIANNA:
Okay.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.096
It's time to practice
my interviewer face.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.682
Does this lipstick say,
"Ooh, interesting,"

19:01.724 --> 19:04.102
or... "I share your pain."

19:04.143 --> 19:06.479
It kind of just looks like
you ate a Popsicle.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.855
So, what is

19:07.897 --> 19:09.732
this whole documentary thing
about again?

19:09.774 --> 19:11.109
Big stories of everyday people.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.193
We drive around,
we get people to talk

19:13.235 --> 19:14.821
about their
hopes and their dreams,

19:14.862 --> 19:16.530
and then we find
something amazing.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.532
This was your
brother's genius idea.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.284
Well, thanks
for letting me tag along.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.036
I needed
to get out of the house,

19:22.078 --> 19:24.122
and... maybe hearing
about other people's stories

19:24.163 --> 19:26.373
will help me
get over my writer's block.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.960
Why don't you just write
about your steamy lust for Liam?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.044
Hello.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.421
Wait, who told you about that?
Naomi said

19:32.463 --> 19:34.924
you stole Mark
and used him

19:34.966 --> 19:36.300
as a sex buffer.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.844
Half brother
as a chaperone.

19:37.885 --> 19:41.347
That's a desperate move.
You must want
Liam real bad.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.556
No, I don't.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.100
Okay, I do
a little bit.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.727
But not really.
I think.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.896
I don't know.
SILVER:
Well, I know

19:48.938 --> 19:51.107
that lust is not confusing.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.484
Real feelings are confusing.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.195
This is my
interviewer face

19:56.236 --> 19:58.447
for, "You're not telling
us the whole story."

19:58.489 --> 20:00.116
Okay, fine, fine.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.743
I keep thinking
about sex with Liam.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.745
Go on.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.874
No!
Look,

20:07.915 --> 20:10.918
I was sure that by getting
through this thing I'm writing

20:10.960 --> 20:12.128
it would stop,

20:12.170 --> 20:14.005
but it hasn't.
I know I don't want

20:14.047 --> 20:16.382
a relationship with Liam,
so why do I keep thinking

20:16.423 --> 20:17.842
about having sex with him?

20:17.884 --> 20:20.260
Because sex with Liam
would ruin your friendship

20:20.302 --> 20:22.096
and your living situation,

20:22.138 --> 20:25.224
therefore a really
great way to run away
from your feelings.

20:25.265 --> 20:28.895
Oh, my God, that is exactly what
Amanda said about Annabelle.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.480
Okay, I don't know
who those girls are,

20:31.522 --> 20:34.025
but, um, even if you did
have feelings for Liam,

20:34.067 --> 20:35.735
there'd be nothing
wrong with that.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.028
Yes, there would.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.363
Liam and I have tried
to make it work a hundred times.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.699
If it were meant to be,
it would have happened by now.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.744
(scoffs) What,
like my documentary career?

20:44.785 --> 20:46.162
I've started it
a hundred times, too,

20:46.204 --> 20:48.414
but it doesn't mean it's
not gonna work out this time.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.791
Exactly. As pathetic
and as hopeless

20:50.833 --> 20:52.418
as this truck idea is,

20:52.459 --> 20:54.212
it can work
if we try.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.547
Watch.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.760
What are you doing?

21:00.801 --> 21:03.387
Cosmetic counters do
this all the time.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.223
People stop for something
that they want, and then

21:05.264 --> 21:06.682
we get what we
want in return.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.475
It proves that
dumb ideas can work

21:08.517 --> 21:11.062
if you keep trying.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.355

21:13.397 --> 21:16.067
Get your makeover!

21:20.362 --> 21:21.948
DIXON:
Yo.
Hey.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.617
I thought I heard you
upstairs on the mic.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.702
You deejaying
the opening?

21:26.744 --> 21:30.039
No, no, um, I'm actually
doing a little...

21:30.081 --> 21:32.041
showcase for Michaela,
so I was upstairs

21:32.083 --> 21:33.459
setting up some
equipment.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.836
Hey, dude, do you have
an extension cord?

21:35.878 --> 21:39.257
Uh... yeah, yeah,
let me get you one.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.424
Thanks.

21:40.466 --> 21:41.717
(clears throat)

21:41.759 --> 21:43.594
Wait, wait, you mean
surrogate Michaela?

21:43.636 --> 21:46.388
Mm-hmm.
I didn't know she
wanted to be a singer.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.975
Neither did she, until I
discovered her raw talent.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.309
You did?
Mm-hmm.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.061
What's Silver think about that?

21:52.103 --> 21:56.065
(sighs) Why does everybody
keep asking me about that?

21:56.107 --> 21:57.150
Well, I didn't tell Silver

21:57.191 --> 21:59.443
because she wasn't
in a good place, okay?

21:59.485 --> 22:02.071
So, now she's out having
a great day, thanks to me,

22:02.113 --> 22:03.697
so when she gets
to the showcase,

22:03.739 --> 22:06.659
Michaela will get on stage
and seal the deal.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.868
Well,

22:07.910 --> 22:10.288
if you really want to
make Silver's day,

22:10.329 --> 22:14.000
you should buy her a beer
made by yours truly.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.794
Handcrafted using only
the finest ingredients.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.338
Okay, well, uh, you got
the commercial down.

22:19.379 --> 22:22.049
I hope this lives up
to the hype.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.217
Yeah, man, me, too.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.260
I got to find something
that I love

22:24.302 --> 22:27.387

you know?

22:28.472 --> 22:29.932
Damn, dude, is
that the board

22:29.974 --> 22:31.184
that you showed
me last week?

22:31.225 --> 22:32.977
Yeah.
Yo,

22:33.019 --> 22:34.061
it is sick.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.646
We got to take it out
for a test run, man.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.815
Yeah, yeah.
Another time, though.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.900
Today, we drink.

22:39.942 --> 22:43.279

'Cause it's appealing?
I get it, I get it.

You're gonna love it.

Um... I-I think there's
something wrong with it.

23:04.133 --> 23:06.760
What? No.
I followed the recipe exactly.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.012
You just don't know
how to drink beer.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.347
You don't sip it like a latte.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.556
Uh, I don't think anybody's

23:10.597 --> 23:12.432
supposed to sip
that, dude. Try it.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.232
Maybe it just needs
to ferment more.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.025
Look, I'm-I'm not
trying to be harsh,

23:21.067 --> 23:22.068
uh, but

Court of Appeal deserves

25:47.463 --> 25:49.089
And you just got married
last year?

So, he went off

26:00.893 --> 26:02.436

26:02.478 --> 26:04.438

again, so...

to convince myself he wasn't

26:10.361 --> 26:11.278
But...

26:36.720 --> 26:38.764
♪ ♪

26:43.352 --> 26:45.438
That's the newest beer
from Court Brewing Company.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.231
Supplies are running low,
so you want to grab

26:47.273 --> 26:48.690
this great tasting brew
while you can.

26:48.732 --> 26:49.858
I'll try one. How much?

26:49.900 --> 26:50.984
You know what?

26:51.026 --> 26:52.361
I'm so confident
that you're gonna be back,

26:52.403 --> 26:53.320
the first one's on me.

26:53.362 --> 26:54.947
Thanks.
It's a recipe

26:54.988 --> 26:56.407
that dates back
to 1700s England.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.494
Maybe it should
have stayed there.

27:01.745 --> 27:02.829
Hey, man,

27:02.871 --> 27:04.498
we've had some complaints
about the beer.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.125
Oh, well...
I don't know, I mean,

27:06.166 --> 27:08.626
once you get used to it,
it's not the worst thing ever.

27:09.378 --> 27:10.963
Okay, it sucks.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.339
Can't have bad beer
at the opening.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.300
We're having enough
trouble already.
Get rid of it.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.260
(sighs)

27:17.219 --> 27:18.845
Naomi, hey.

27:18.887 --> 27:19.888
Uh, are we ever gonna
get our food?

27:19.930 --> 27:21.056
We're-we're starving.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.475
The soup is coming right up.

27:22.516 --> 27:24.642
Here, have some chips.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.353
Well,

27:26.395 --> 27:28.730
have you guys, um, set a date?

27:28.772 --> 27:30.149
No, Campbell wants
to work for the company

27:30.190 --> 27:32.443
for at least a year
before we really settle down.

27:32.485 --> 27:33.944
Oh. What company?

27:33.986 --> 27:35.154
He didn't tell you?

27:35.195 --> 27:36.989
Well, my father runs
one of the biggest

27:37.030 --> 27:38.574
investment banking firms
in the state,

27:38.616 --> 27:40.367
and he's putting Campbell
on the executive track

27:40.409 --> 27:41.452
right after graduation.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.454
Wow, it takes guys years
to get that far.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.372
Yeah, well...
I'm excited for him,

27:45.414 --> 27:46.915
but he's gonna be
working really hard.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.168
Yeah, I can imagine
Campbell's gonna be having

27:49.209 --> 27:51.128
a lot of, uh, late nights.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.296
Well, that's okay.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.797
It's important
to build your career.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.299
You know,
he'd probably put in

27:55.341 --> 27:56.634
a good word for you
at the company.

27:56.674 --> 27:58.135
He loves going
that extra mile

27:58.177 --> 27:59.261
for his Cronus brothers.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.054
It's practically
his mantra:

28:01.096 --> 28:02.848
brothers helping brothers.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.891
You know what? You're right.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.227
Campbell is working so hard,
he's probably ready

28:07.269 --> 28:08.770
for a little
study break.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.523
What do you say
we go surprise him right now

28:10.564 --> 28:12.690
with some of these,
uh, delicious chips?

28:12.732 --> 28:13.859
Okay.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.986
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.780
Everything will be
out in just a second.

28:18.822 --> 28:19.906
(sighs)

28:19.948 --> 28:21.534
Dixon, thank God.

28:21.575 --> 28:22.742
The kitchen
is backed up,

28:22.784 --> 28:23.785
the crowd is going crazy.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.454
I need you to get
Michaela on stage

28:25.496 --> 28:26.622
right now to sing.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.874
I-I can't, I haven't
talked to Silver yet.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.167
If you don't get her on stage,

28:30.209 --> 28:31.544
these people are going
to kill someone,

28:31.585 --> 28:33.546
and that someone
is gonna be you

28:33.587 --> 28:35.297
because I will get on
the mic and tell them
it's all your fault.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.216
Okay, okay, fine, fine,
you got it.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.926
Thank you. When you're done,
I need you take out the trash.

28:39.968 --> 28:40.927
Hell, no.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.346
Okay, o-okay,
Hello?

28:42.388 --> 28:43.556
I meant, "Hell, yes."

28:43.597 --> 28:44.598
Thank you.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.141
She's playing.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.351
It's okay.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.480
I'm gonna go look for Liam.

28:51.522 --> 28:52.814
This place looks different.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.692
It's amazing.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.443
SILVER:
I can't believe
after a whole day

28:56.485 --> 28:57.861
we only got
one interview.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.405
It was a good
one, but still...

28:59.446 --> 29:00.822
Hey, it was your
first time out.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.032
Besides,

29:02.074 --> 29:04.410
your one interview made
quite the impact on Annie.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.537
Yeah... yeah, you're right.

29:06.579 --> 29:08.997
I should probably thank Dixon
for getting me started.

29:09.039 --> 29:11.124
Like he said,
every dream

29:11.166 --> 29:13.460
begins with a first step.
(chuckles)

29:13.502 --> 29:15.754
MICHAELA:
Hey, everybody.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.716
Is that Michaela on stage?

29:18.757 --> 29:20.634
So, this is kind of
a dream of mine

29:20.676 --> 29:22.595
to get this chance, so...

29:22.636 --> 29:24.638
well, thanks
for giving me a shot.

30:03.636 --> 30:04.678
I'm so glad you're here.

Hey.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.676
This was amazing.

30:43.717 --> 30:44.802
Oh, really?
Yeah.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.928
Look, it means so much
to me that you're cool

30:46.970 --> 30:48.221
with me doing this
with Dixon.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.932
He thinks it's a really good
first step before we start

30:50.974 --> 30:52.017
getting serious in the studio.

30:52.058 --> 30:53.477
Wait.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.604
You're recording with Dixon?
Yeah.

30:55.646 --> 30:57.606
I mean, he said
he was gonna talk to you

30:57.648 --> 30:59.775
and make sure you were cool
with me pursuing my dream.

30:59.817 --> 31:00.776
Okay.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.986
Oh, God, please tell me
he spoke to you.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.988
No.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.074
Just give me one second.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.660
Yeah.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.078
Hey, Silver.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.413
Uh, how was your big day?

31:13.455 --> 31:15.081
Not as good as yours.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.334
I spent all day on a truck

31:17.376 --> 31:18.418
and I got one interview.

31:18.460 --> 31:21.672
You just found your
new recording star.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.423
Oh, uh, look, I-I can explain.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.258
No, you don't have to,
'cause I get it.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.093
Michaela's my surrogate,
but you decided

31:27.135 --> 31:28.804
to talk her
into a singing career,

31:28.846 --> 31:30.639
because, I don't know,
what could be better

31:30.681 --> 31:33.141
for my unborn child
than long nights on a tour bus

31:33.183 --> 31:34.560
going from club to club?

31:34.601 --> 31:36.019
Silver, I wouldn't do that.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.354
Yes, you would, Dixon.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.980
Because you don't care
about what's important to me

31:39.022 --> 31:41.900
or anyone else, you only care
about what's important to you.

31:41.941 --> 31:44.110
The pep talk?

31:44.152 --> 31:45.654
About following my dreams?

31:45.696 --> 31:47.740
It makes sense now.

31:47.781 --> 31:49.783
You weren't talking
about my dreams,

31:49.825 --> 31:52.578
you were just
talking about yours.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.999
(sighs)

32:03.004 --> 32:04.757
Last of the entrees coming up.

32:04.798 --> 32:05.799
I need my avocados now.

32:05.841 --> 32:06.717
Okay.

32:06.759 --> 32:08.009
I said now, not next Thursday.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.469
You want them faster,
I can throw them at you.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.221
Hey, the toilet's backed
up in the men's room.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.222
NAOMI AND MARK:
Handle it!

32:12.264 --> 32:14.057
Me? Come on.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.644
(electronic tones sound)

32:17.686 --> 32:19.979
Dixon, how could you
just forget to tell her?

32:20.021 --> 32:21.189
I-I didn't forget.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.275
I was just waiting
for the perfect time, okay?

32:23.316 --> 32:24.359
I screwed up, I know.

32:24.401 --> 32:26.403
Silver must
be so pissed.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.405
This baby thing is her dream.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.323
I know.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.492
And that's why I'm gonna
fix this. One second.

32:32.534 --> 32:33.577
Ade.

32:33.619 --> 32:34.953
Hey, um...

32:34.994 --> 32:35.995
Hey.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.080
Look, Silver's
not picking up

32:37.122 --> 32:38.248
my phone calls
right now,

32:38.290 --> 32:40.250
and I really need to
get a message to her,

32:40.292 --> 32:42.586
so, uh... is the camera
equipment still here?

32:42.628 --> 32:44.838
Yeah, it's in the
truck parked out front.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.090
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.718
Hey, hey, that's not
hot fudge

32:49.760 --> 32:51.553
you're slapping on there,
it's argan oil.

32:51.595 --> 32:52.596
It's extremely rare.

32:52.638 --> 32:53.597
You drizzle it.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.223
Okay, you know
what, Mark?

32:55.265 --> 32:57.392
I've been busting my ass
for you all night.

32:57.434 --> 32:58.852
How about a "please"
and "thank you"?

32:58.894 --> 32:59.937
Please get out of my way.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.438
Thank you.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.024
What are you doing?

33:05.066 --> 33:06.485
I'm sitting down.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.695
I'm tired. I haven't eaten
all night.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.489
I feel like I'm
gonna faint.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.407
You know what? You can serve
your stupid desserts yourself.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.910
And after tonight, we are
no longer business partners.

33:14.952 --> 33:18.204
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna have
a business, thanks to you.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.206
And I'm not the one with the
mansion and the designer clothes

33:20.248 --> 33:21.333
and the line-jumper pass.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.835
This actually
meant something to me.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.210
I can't believe
I used to daydream

33:24.252 --> 33:25.796
about what my brother
would be like--

33:25.838 --> 33:27.422
how he'd always be there for me

33:27.464 --> 33:29.048
and how he'd always
have my back.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.843
And then voila, I meet him
and... (chuckles)

33:30.884 --> 33:33.971
he's a total douche.
I c... I can't breathe.

33:34.012 --> 33:37.516
(gasping):
I can't breathe.

33:37.557 --> 33:40.477
M-My throat.
(coughing)

33:40.519 --> 33:41.561
My throat, Mark.

33:41.603 --> 33:42.604
(gasping)
Hold still.

33:42.646 --> 33:43.522
What are you doing?

33:43.563 --> 33:46.316
Ow!
(groaning)

33:46.358 --> 33:48.735
Just breathe.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.864
(groans, panting)

33:57.410 --> 33:58.871
What just happened?

33:58.912 --> 34:00.497
I might've just saved your life.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.422
Oh.
(grunts)

34:10.465 --> 34:12.217
(bottles clinking)
Whoa.

34:12.257 --> 34:14.344
Clean up on aisle nine!

34:14.386 --> 34:16.094
Oh, my God.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.139
I was trying to make
my beer taste better.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.516
Marshmallow whip
almost did the trick.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.476
Are you drunk?

34:21.518 --> 34:24.396
What? No.
(scoffs)

34:24.437 --> 34:27.774
It's not like I drank it... all.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.902
Spilled a bunch-- most of it...
on my clothes.

34:29.943 --> 34:32.821
But, hey, lucky for you,
it's my turn to do the laundry.

34:32.862 --> 34:33.780
(chuckles)

34:33.822 --> 34:35.489
Hey, come here.

34:35.532 --> 34:38.117
Oh, okay.
(sighs)

34:38.159 --> 34:40.996
You smell like nice soap.

34:41.038 --> 34:42.163
(chuckles)

34:42.205 --> 34:45.083
Hey. Hey.

34:45.123 --> 34:47.085
You were right.

34:47.126 --> 34:50.964
When am I gonna
figure out what I want?

34:54.717 --> 34:57.220
O-Okay. Okay, uh...

34:57.262 --> 35:02.059
if we're about to do what
I think we both want to do...

35:02.100 --> 35:04.436
...then we have
to finally get it right.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.898
I know we've tried this,
like, a hundred times, but...

35:07.940 --> 35:10.358
if we're both ready
and want the same thing,

35:10.400 --> 35:14.153
then I want this to be our 101.

35:14.195 --> 35:17.574
(sighs)
I think I still love you, Liam.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.911
(snoring)

35:23.080 --> 35:24.414
Liam?

35:24.456 --> 35:26.750
(snoring)

35:27.709 --> 35:29.753
(sighs)

35:36.718 --> 35:39.679
Sorry I wasn't able to help you
finish the desserts.

35:39.721 --> 35:41.180
It's fine.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.100
At least no one else
had an allergic reaction.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.727
(chuckles)
The paramedics gave me
some more antihistamines.

35:45.769 --> 35:48.688
Who's allergic
to argan oil anyway?
You.

35:48.730 --> 35:52.358
And me. Which is why I always
have epinephrine nearby.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.989
Well, I guess sharing the same
weird allergy means we...

35:57.030 --> 35:59.282
have at least
one thing in common.
(chuckles)

35:59.324 --> 36:01.660
Might even make us
family adjacent.

36:03.202 --> 36:05.413
You know how you said
you thought about me?

36:05.455 --> 36:07.457
How you wondered who I was?

36:07.499 --> 36:10.418
The truth is...
I thought about you, too.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.212
You did?
Yeah.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.799
My parents told me
I was adopted pretty early on.

36:15.841 --> 36:18.635
They said all the right things
about how I was special

36:18.677 --> 36:20.137
because they chose me, but...

36:20.178 --> 36:21.596
sometimes I couldn't help
but wonder

36:21.638 --> 36:22.931
what the rest of my family

36:22.973 --> 36:24.599
was like.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.309
Are you anything
like I thought you'd be?

36:26.351 --> 36:28.645
Definitely
not, but...

36:28.687 --> 36:31.439
I did think about you.

36:31.481 --> 36:34.359
I'm sorry I ruined
your restaurant opening.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.862
Hey, we got through it, right?
(chuckles)

36:36.903 --> 36:40.281
Yeah, not before you went
all Gordon Ramsay on me.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.159
"I need my avocados now!"

36:42.200 --> 36:44.327
And you were like,
"Help me, I can't breathe!"

36:44.369 --> 36:46.204
(laughs)
Oh, my God.

36:46.245 --> 36:49.708
(sighs)
I think we got that family
memory you were going for.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.627
(chuckles)

36:52.669 --> 36:54.671
Wait, if you're allergic
to argan oil,

36:54.713 --> 36:56.506
why do you use it
in your cooking?

36:56.548 --> 36:58.091
Because it's the best.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.801
I only use the best.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.887
(chuckling):
Oh.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.806
You and me are
totally related.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.475
(knocking)

37:07.517 --> 37:09.268
Knock knock.
Hey.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.396
Hey.

37:12.522 --> 37:15.150
You left so fast
you forgot your camera.

37:15.192 --> 37:17.694
(groans)
Thanks.

37:19.487 --> 37:23.366
Not exactly a banner day
for my filmmaking career.

37:23.408 --> 37:27.829
Or my baby-making career,
for that matter.

37:27.871 --> 37:29.497
Look...

37:29.539 --> 37:33.292
(sighs)
I know it was a hard day.

37:33.334 --> 37:36.755
But giving Noreen that makeover
felt really great.

37:36.796 --> 37:40.217
It feels really good giving
people their dream moment.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.634
(sighs)

37:41.676 --> 37:44.596
You could do the same thing
for Michaela.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.267
Hey.

37:49.308 --> 37:50.602
(beeping)

37:50.643 --> 37:52.687
I think you should watch this.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.982
Well...

37:56.024 --> 37:58.777
Okay.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.695
(clears throat)

38:00.737 --> 38:03.698
(mutters)
Okay.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.533
Okay, so, this is a documentary

38:05.575 --> 38:07.160
about people's life story,
right?

38:07.202 --> 38:09.913
Well, my story is...

38:09.955 --> 38:11.539
I screwed up, okay?

38:11.581 --> 38:14.084
I should've told you about
Michaela from the beginning.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.586
I guess I was just scared
that I might lose her

38:16.628 --> 38:18.255
because she might be
my last chance.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.756
Just like she is for you.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.674
So... I-I figured out a way

38:21.716 --> 38:23.342
to make all of our dreams
come true.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.845
No tours, no clubs.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.473
I want us to make a music video.
And I want you

38:28.514 --> 38:30.558
to be the director.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.518
'Cause, honestly, Silver,

38:32.560 --> 38:35.063
you're one of the most talented
people I know.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.905
(footsteps approaching)

38:43.947 --> 38:46.866
Hey. Drunky.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.994
It's almost 11:00.

38:50.495 --> 38:53.498
(groaning)

38:53.539 --> 38:57.627
(hisses)
Oh, this hangover
makes it official.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.337
My beer is terrible.

38:59.378 --> 39:01.631
(chuckles)
Well, at least you tried.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.801
(sighs)
Hey.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.386
Did we talk last night?

39:09.430 --> 39:11.641
No.
(chuckles)

39:11.683 --> 39:13.685
(door opens)

39:13.726 --> 39:15.812
(door closes)

39:17.772 --> 39:20.066
The engagement's off!

39:20.108 --> 39:22.443
You're not the person
I thought I knew at all.

39:23.444 --> 39:24.904
(sighs)

39:24.946 --> 39:26.239
CAMPBELL:
Shirazi.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.283
You really sold me out.
You sold yourself out.

39:28.325 --> 39:30.451
You were the one who was caught
studying with your ex.

39:30.493 --> 39:31.744
Hey, you can
forget about Cronus

39:31.786 --> 39:32.996
and everything
that goes along with it.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.039
You're done.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.165
Yeah, I figured. You know,

39:35.207 --> 39:36.541
I bought into the whole
brotherhood business.

39:36.582 --> 39:38.626
But I don't need help
from a brother like you.

39:38.668 --> 39:39.711
What, you think
you're better than me?

39:39.752 --> 39:40.837
Yeah, I do.
For the simple fact

39:40.879 --> 39:42.172
that I don't have to lie, cheat

39:42.214 --> 39:43.215
or scam my way through life.

39:43.256 --> 39:45.258
Wow. You're really a nice guy.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.219
But I got news for you...

39:47.260 --> 39:48.928
nice guys finish last.

39:53.558 --> 39:56.978
DIXON:
Oh, man, this swell
has been dope lately.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.689
You ready for me to school
you, Mr. Court of No Appeal?

39:59.731 --> 40:02.025
Man, keep talking. I'm gonna be
dropping in on your waves

40:02.067 --> 40:05.778
all day.
Whoa, whoa. Touchy.
Look, I'm just joking.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.613
So what, okay?
Brewmaster isn't your thing.

40:07.655 --> 40:08.990
Then what is?

40:09.032 --> 40:10.242
I mean, I know
this whole

40:10.283 --> 40:12.118
beer thing was not
my life's work, but...

40:12.160 --> 40:14.246
I don't want to be what Annie
said, you know? That guy

40:14.287 --> 40:16.622
that's just sitting around
waiting for life to happen.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.167
You know, I-I want to find
something that I love.

40:19.209 --> 40:22.212
Something I'm... really
passionate about, you know?

40:22.254 --> 40:23.838
Yeah, yeah.
Well...

40:23.880 --> 40:25.590
while you're waiting to find
that, maybe you should...

40:25.631 --> 40:27.466
get busy making me
one of these custom boards.

40:27.508 --> 40:28.968
Dude, I'm telling you,

40:29.010 --> 40:30.136
that thing is so sweet, man.

40:30.178 --> 40:31.846
If I had money, I'd pay for it.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.057
Really?

40:34.099 --> 40:35.016
Yeah.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.102
How much?

40:50.698 --> 40:53.326
Wow. Annie, once again
your writing surprises me.

40:53.368 --> 40:56.621
(chuckles)
I was up all night
working on it,

40:56.662 --> 40:58.664
and it took me a while, but...

40:58.706 --> 41:01.500
I think I finally found
the ending that I really want.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.544
Well, it's better
than I expected.

41:03.586 --> 41:06.547
When Annabelle tells Leo
how she feels and they kiss

41:06.589 --> 41:08.507
and then he sweeps her up
in his arms

41:08.549 --> 41:11.010
and rides off with her
on his motorcycle?

41:11.052 --> 41:13.221
Chills.

41:13.263 --> 41:16.433
It feels perfect
'cause it feels true.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.351
Thanks.

41:18.393 --> 41:21.104
But, um... it's not.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.773
At least not right now.

41:28.236 --> 41:30.280
(sighs)
