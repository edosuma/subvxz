- [Woman] Ellie
we're gonna be late.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.930
- You know, you forgot a
minus sign on this one.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.306
- Couldn't you just put it in?

00:56.348 --> 00:57.892
- I'm not the one in 3rd grade.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.731
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.399
Sit and have some breakfast.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.984
- Can't, you said so
yourself, I'm gonna be late.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.151
- Sit.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.486
Fix your outfit please.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.990
- Yeah, seriously.

01:13.032 --> 01:14.575
- Shut up.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.326
- Ellie, don't talk to
your sister like that.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.953
- Half sister.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.747
- Mom!
- Vance!

01:19.788 --> 01:22.541
- Guys, make this woman happy.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.668
Or I'm gonna have to pay for it.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.085
- Okay.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.172
- I have a showing after school.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.008
So I need you here
to watch Dakota.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.928
- Mom, no, I have my
driver's test after school.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.054
You said I could
borrow your car.

01:35.094 --> 01:36.805
- Ugh, well I'm sorry El.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.640
I totally forgot.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.184
- Mom, I've only talked
about it every day this week.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.603
- Well we'll reschedule.

01:42.644 --> 01:43.854
- My permit's about to expire.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.480
When are we gonna reschedule it?

01:45.522 --> 01:48.149
- Ellie, we'll got to the DMV.

01:48.191 --> 01:51.486
It's driver's ed, not
the end of the world.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.655
- Yeah, like you didn't
do this on purpose.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.203
- Teenagers, am I right?

02:00.245 --> 02:01.121

02:23.060 --> 02:25.395
Oh that's right, you
don't have a car.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.605
Seriously, a skateboard?

02:29.357 --> 02:30.985
(school bell rings)

02:31.026 --> 02:32.861
- [Announcer] It's the
last day of school, folks.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.114
Remember, clean
out your lockers.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.950
What I find left
behind becomes mine.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.211
- There she is.
- What's up freak?

02:50.253 --> 02:52.589
- [Teacher] Look who I found
loitering in the hallway.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.342
- She's late.
- You've been making

02:55.383 --> 02:57.761
quite a habit out
of this Ms. Lansing.

02:57.803 --> 02:58.804
She's all yours.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.307
- Sorry I'm late.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.476
- The final exam's
already started.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.269
- She's gonna get an F, man.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.521
- Oh look, there's
the nerdvicular, man.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.356
- Eyes on your tests, gentlemen.

03:13.652 --> 03:16.155
(tense music)

03:17.489 --> 03:18.532
- Thank you.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.411
- This one's firing,
you can go ahead.

03:26.665 --> 03:29.208
- You know if you guys
just go adding more air,

03:29.250 --> 03:30.418
you're gonna mess up--
- I already rejetted

03:30.460 --> 03:31.879
the carburetor, Mr. Hicks.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.797
Air fuel ratio should be good.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.298
- Okay.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.509
And you didn't
wanna take my class.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.136
- She's a natural.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.763
- I'd rather be driving
a car than fixing one.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.058
- Well, you'll finally
get your chance today.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.768
- Actually I won't.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.396
My mom won't be here
on time with her car.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.564
- You just need a car?

03:51.940 --> 03:52.816
Use the shop car.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.072
- Does it actually drive?

03:58.113 --> 04:00.157
- It's registered
and everything.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.533
Go on.

04:02.868 --> 04:03.994
- Thank you.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.204
- You're welcome.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.246
Now let's finish up.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.374
Oh, well then.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.960
- Let's try a left turn.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.846
All right, why don't you
take her back in lot there

04:22.888 --> 04:24.264
and we'll try parallel parking.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.432
- Mm 'kay.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.727
- So are we partying this
weekend guys, or what?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.145
- [Student] I hear Dice's
parents are outta town.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.396
- No way, we gotta go.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.441
- Why don't you go
ahead and try and park

04:34.482 --> 04:36.193
between those two cars up there.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.778
- No problem.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.529
- Oh hey, hey, hey, let
me see that really quick.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.156
Let me see.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.950
Check this out, guys.

04:47.579 --> 04:48.789
(examiner yelling)

04:48.830 --> 04:49.915
No, look out.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.709
(exclaiming)

04:52.751 --> 04:54.920
(yelling)

05:01.718 --> 05:03.262
- Uh...

05:07.891 --> 05:09.059
Well okay.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.563
Well you passed, young lady.

05:16.275 --> 05:17.609
I need to get a new job.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.245
- Hey moron, you
scuffed our soccer ball

05:28.287 --> 05:29.288
with your ugly car.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.215
(metal crunching)

05:40.257 --> 05:41.175
- Oops.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.217
- What the heck?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.263
- You knew I did not have
time to come here today.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.140
What is this, punishment?

05:48.182 --> 05:50.725
And you wonder why I didn't
want you to get your license.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.228
- So you did blow me
off on purpose today.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.689
- Yes and you just proved
that I was right to do so

05:55.730 --> 05:57.440
because the second
you get your license

05:57.482 --> 05:59.067
you smash some kid's car.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.278
- Mom it was an accident.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.779
- Is that what
you're gonna go with?

06:02.821 --> 06:04.781
It was an accident.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.117
There were a ton of
witnesses, Ellie.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.953
- Mom, he started it.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.789
- Well insurance doesn't
cover "he started it".

06:14.833 --> 06:16.793
- Vance can afford it.

06:16.835 --> 06:20.339
- Yes Vance can afford
it and he's not going to

06:20.379 --> 06:23.008
because you are getting
a job this summer

06:23.050 --> 06:25.426
and every dollar you make

06:25.468 --> 06:27.554
will go to pay for
that poor kid's car.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.225
(boys laughing)

06:32.517 --> 06:33.852
(sighs)

06:33.894 --> 06:35.478
- [Vance] Well at least
the cops weren't involved.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.272
- Yeah, not this time.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.982
She's just like her dad.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.943
- [Vance] Well,
you may be right.

06:41.985 --> 06:45.572
- [Mom] God, her temperament
and her attitude,

06:45.613 --> 06:47.406
it's just so much like Elliott.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.951
And I tried to give
her a different life,

06:49.993 --> 06:51.912
we tried to give her
a different life.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.412
- Maybe she would benefit

06:53.454 --> 06:56.457
from a more rigid
learning environment.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.003
- She is already at the best
private school in Monterey.

07:00.045 --> 07:03.257
I mean what are you talking
about, boarding school?

07:03.298 --> 07:06.385
(sad music)

07:06.425 --> 07:08.929
(phone rings)

07:12.599 --> 07:13.767
- Hey.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.060
- You okay?

07:16.686 --> 07:17.771
- No.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.315
- Your folks pretty mad?

07:20.357 --> 07:21.942
- They don't even want me here.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.945
- [Friend] What are
you talking about?

07:24.986 --> 07:29.366
- I just, maybe everyone'd
be happier if I were gone.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.202
I just, I wanna
get outta Monterey.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.453
I don't fit in here.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.791
And I got my license today.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.127
I can go anywhere.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.921
- [Friend] So what,
you're gonna run away?

07:45.257 --> 07:46.133
- I don't know.

07:47.426 --> 07:48.635
- Be serious.

07:48.676 --> 07:49.719
They love you.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.721
You have a good life, Ellie.

07:51.763 --> 07:52.973
Where would you even go?

07:54.557 --> 07:57.102
- I wanna find out
who my dad was.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.728
Where I came from.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.147
- You can't drive off, Ellie.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.149
New cars all have GPS.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.818
The cops can track
you in a heartbeat.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.780
- Well maybe I don't need
one of their stupid new cars.

08:14.328 --> 08:17.080
(dramatic music)

08:38.643 --> 08:39.644
Sorry, Mom.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.113
So I only have my driver's test.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.532
But I passed with flying colors.

10:15.574 --> 10:16.866
- I'm gonna need to see it.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.288
This is quite the car.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.749
- I got rear ended in a
parking lot a few days ago.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.585
Haven't had a chance
to fix her yet.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.385
- Ellie Lansing, that's you.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.303
- That's me.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.099
- All right, well you just
stay here, Ms. Lansing,

10:41.141 --> 10:42.225
you understand?

10:42.267 --> 10:43.643
- Yes sir.

10:53.361 --> 10:57.073
- Hey, is your head clear?

10:57.115 --> 11:00.034
(thoughtful music)

11:04.456 --> 11:08.293
(radio transmission garbling)

11:21.806 --> 11:25.602
- I thought you were
taking me to the station.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.605
- All right, who's gonna sign?

11:30.315 --> 11:31.191
- Uncle Tim?

11:35.654 --> 11:37.780
(scoffs)

11:39.157 --> 11:40.867
- She's fine, Jess.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.244
Yeah, for real.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.496
'Cause I'm looking
at her right now.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.041
Uh yeah, yeah, she's just fine.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.918
Well now she is.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.337
So I.

11:53.754 --> 11:58.301
Why don't we take a
step back, breathe.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.760
Take a step back.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.473
Jess, you need to calm down.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.645
We didn't really have
a chance to discuss it.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.313
What more she knows, but also,

12:12.357 --> 12:13.983
let me ask her.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.193
All right.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.278
I hear ya.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.322
(sighs)

12:20.615 --> 12:22.617
(sighs)

12:30.709 --> 12:32.085
- Is she pissed?

12:33.211 --> 12:35.630
- Well I'll tell ya something.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.674
I don't know of a word
in the English language

12:37.716 --> 12:39.175
that sums up how
mad your mom is.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.677
Gimme a hand with this light.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.429
Pull that leg up.

12:44.556 --> 12:45.432
- Okay.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.519
Well she'll be much happier
without me there, trust me.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.020
- [Tim] Really?

12:51.062 --> 12:52.855
'Cause I'll tell ya she
didn't sound very happy.

12:53.898 --> 12:54.899
- You got kids?

12:54.941 --> 12:57.818
- I do not have kids, no.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.530
- Then you don't know
how much parents hate

13:00.572 --> 13:01.531
having them around.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.951
- Well that may be.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.869
But I do have parents.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.581
As frustrating as they can be,
the good ones always love ya.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.165
That's a fact.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.667
- Have you been living
here this whole time?

13:12.709 --> 13:15.712
- I do get out during
the day sometimes.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.631
- Mom said she didn't know
how to get ahold of you.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.549
- Okay well don't blame
your mom for that, okay?

13:19.591 --> 13:21.342
I completely understand
someone like me

13:21.384 --> 13:23.219
not fitting into your
mom's new lifestyle.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.304
Okay?

13:24.345 --> 13:25.804
I don't have a problem with it.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.014
So you shouldn't have
a problem with it.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.933
- But you're family.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.018
- Every family
has a black sheep.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.229
Okay, who the
hell's car is this?

13:33.271 --> 13:35.982
- Ah, this is the shop
car from my school.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.816
- And they just let you take it?

13:37.858 --> 13:39.402
- I left a note.
- You left a note

13:39.444 --> 13:41.112
when you stole it then
is what you mean.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.363
Which is great.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.073
Now I gotta make another
phone call tonight.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.866
- I'll handle it.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.035
- Okay well handle it before
the police find out, okay?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.828
There's only so much
Sheriff Cooper can handle.

13:49.870 --> 13:50.829
- Yeah, will do.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.667
- All right, I'm in the loft.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.376
Cot's for you.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.712
- You want me to sleep on that?

13:57.754 --> 13:59.714
- To be honest I don't really
care what you do on it.

13:59.756 --> 14:00.923
But I'm going to bed.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.509
- Wow, you're a real charmer.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.843
- Or we could get back in the
car and I could take ya home.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.346
- No thank you.
- Then the cot.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.097
You understand me?

14:08.139 --> 14:09.223
- Yeah.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.975
This place is disgusting.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.935
- Well you know what, your
dad almost lived here.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.062
And this crap was
good enough for him.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.105
- My dad?

14:16.147 --> 14:18.775
(gentle music)

14:20.151 --> 14:21.695
- Soon as I wake
up I'll take a look

14:21.736 --> 14:23.237
at your stolen shop
car, see what I can fix.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.031
- It's something in
the radiator system.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.825
Coolant leak maybe,
I can fix it.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.036
- Well good.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.204
That's even better.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.539
Got my own crap to take care of.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.043
(sighs)

14:48.805 --> 14:51.474
(door creaking)

14:53.768 --> 14:56.771
(suspenseful music)

15:25.550 --> 15:27.552
(sighs)

15:51.284 --> 15:52.660
- Um.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.292
- Come on in, buddy.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.752
She's not gonna bite.

16:00.794 --> 16:01.961
That's my niece, Ellie.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.255
- Hi.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.548
I'm Merle.

16:05.590 --> 16:06.925
- Nice to meet you, Earl.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.512
- Oh no, it's, I'm Merle.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.640
- What did I say?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.225
- Earl.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.811
- What did you say?

16:17.852 --> 16:19.228
- Merle.

16:19.270 --> 16:22.649
- Merle, okay, got it.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.067
- Like Merle Haggard.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.363
- Yeah, of course,
like Merle Haggard.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.658
- You two done over there?

16:34.201 --> 16:37.163
- I brought you a couple
of breakfast sandwiches.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.206
And there's some fresh fruit

16:39.248 --> 16:41.417
that just came in this morning.

16:41.459 --> 16:45.087
And that's it.
- What's that?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.506
- What?
- Merle.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.800
You were just about
to show me something.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.050
What was that?

16:51.511 --> 16:55.097
- Um, it's just,

16:55.139 --> 16:58.017
my mom said that women
like men who smell good.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.352
So.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.146
- Is that right?

17:02.188 --> 17:03.815
So a man's gotta smell good

17:03.857 --> 17:05.274
for a woman to like him?

17:05.316 --> 17:06.609
Is that about right?

17:06.651 --> 17:08.402
- It doesn't hurt.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.613
- Well I guess I need
to wear that stuff then.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.366
What's it's, what is
that called, ultra?

17:16.327 --> 17:17.662
- Deodorant.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.246
- What will science
think of next?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.460
- Okay I'm just gonna
leave this here.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.004
- Thank you for coming buddy.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.341
- (chuckles) Here's another one.

17:33.678 --> 17:36.055
It's really nice
to meet you, Ellie.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.558
- It's nice to meet
you too, Merle.

17:45.815 --> 17:46.941
Ha.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.027
- Okay, so that boy's
got a crush on ya.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.530
Let's take a look at
this car of yours,

17:52.572 --> 17:54.448
see if we can get
it back on the road.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.997
Okay, can't see from here,

18:01.039 --> 18:02.707
but let's make sure the lock
washer's on the inside--

18:02.749 --> 18:03.791
- Or it'll back out.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.209
I got it.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.254
- Yeah, it'll back out.

18:09.714 --> 18:13.175
I gotta say, you
know your engines.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.595
- Yeah, auto shop's
pretty much the only class

18:15.636 --> 18:17.471
I got a decent
grade in this year.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.766
And I didn't even wanna take it.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.726
- Why not?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.352
- Because being an auto mechanic

18:23.394 --> 18:25.730
wouldn't really make
my mom that happy.

18:25.772 --> 18:26.898
No offense.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.524
- No, no, none taken.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.317
And you're probably right.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.945
But that doesn't mean you
can't tinker under the hood

18:31.986 --> 18:35.281
in between doctoring
and lawyering, you know.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.699
Whatever it is you wanna do.

18:36.741 --> 18:39.201
Plus ya save a lot
on car repairs.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.247
- Tim, Tim that's it.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.124
I can make money doing this.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.292
- Yeah.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.086
You didn't know that.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.546
- No, I mean I could work
here for you this summer.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.049
- Well I didn't know
I was hiring, but--

18:53.091 --> 18:54.634
- My mom said I
need a summer job

18:54.675 --> 18:57.553
and this could be it.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.055
- Well I think she
meant down the block.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.099
Not a couple hundred miles away.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.558
- This is perfect.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.894
You said so yourself,
I'm good at it.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.146
- Okay Ellie, look
around this place, huh.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.566
This is not a place a teenager
needs to spend a summer.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.111
You need to be back
home at a shopping mall,

19:13.152 --> 19:14.737
getting into trouble or--

19:14.779 --> 19:17.406
- I need to work this
summer and this is it.

19:17.448 --> 19:18.491
Now look, I know it.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.702
- Your mom would
never go for that.

19:21.744 --> 19:22.620
- You don't know that.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.204
Let met talk to her.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.289
- Ellie.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.207
- Please Tim, I need this.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.170
(hopeful music)

19:31.211 --> 19:34.007
- What are you gonna do
about the stolen shop car?

19:34.048 --> 19:35.549
- We could drive it back

19:35.591 --> 19:36.926
and that would be the
perfect opportunity

19:36.968 --> 19:38.761
to talk to my mom in person.

19:38.803 --> 19:39.887
- No.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.263
Then I'd be there.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.682
- So?

19:42.723 --> 19:44.600
- You said you would
talk to Jessie.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.145
There's no way, I'm not
sitting down for that

19:47.186 --> 19:48.604
fire and fury, I, I--

19:48.646 --> 19:51.273
- A wise man once told
me that the good parents

19:51.315 --> 19:52.191
always love you.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.988
- Well they don't
always love the uncle.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.115
- Let's give it a shot.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.700
If my mom says no

20:00.741 --> 20:03.577
then I won't bring it
up again, case closed.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.124
(sighs)

20:08.166 --> 20:11.044
(thoughtful music)

20:51.876 --> 20:53.544
I'm just gonna throw
this in the truck.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.504
- Sounds good.

20:55.546 --> 20:58.758
(sighs)

20:58.799 --> 21:00.801
Thank you for letting
this happen, Jess.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.638
- I'd be lying if I said
I felt good about it.

21:06.057 --> 21:09.227
But I haven't seen her
this happy in a long time.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.232
- Well she's got some
real skills around
cars, I'll tell ya.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.026
And I'm gonna enjoy the help.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.986
- Just gotta grab
the last of my stuff.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.118
- I'll take good
care of your girl.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.955
- Better than you've been
taking care of yourself I hope.

21:32.583 --> 21:33.918
- I probably deserve that.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.005
But I won't let ya down.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.346
- This is it.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.015
- Okay.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.433
Okay.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.643
Be good.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.186
- Thank you.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.897
(hopeful music)

22:31.142 --> 22:32.392
We're back?

22:32.434 --> 22:33.936
- (sighs) Something tells me

22:33.978 --> 22:35.479
you didn't sleep all
that well last night.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.898
- Please, I had a
deluxe cot in auto bay.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.441
How could I not?

22:39.483 --> 22:40.985
- Oh come on.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.070
You just got upgraded
off the shop floor.

22:43.112 --> 22:45.572
- My my.

22:53.914 --> 22:54.957
- You all good?

22:54.999 --> 22:56.042
- Better than ever.

22:58.585 --> 22:59.837
- All right then.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.714
- So what are we doing tonight?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.383
- You're looking at it.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.760
You're gonna unpack,
I'm gonna go upstairs,

23:06.802 --> 23:07.594
I'm gonna go to bed.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.929
- No way.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.556
Show me around
town or something.

23:11.974 --> 23:14.810
- You were asleep like 10
minutes ago out in the truck.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.645
- Yeah, well I'm not anymore.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.565
Come on, what did you and my
dad used to do around here?

23:21.608 --> 23:24.320
- Well the same thing we
did every Saturday night.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.072
- Okay cool, so what.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.657
- I don't think so, Ellie.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.492
- Why, was it a strip
club or something?

23:30.534 --> 23:32.870
- It's nothing bad, it's just
nothing I have any desire

23:32.912 --> 23:34.580
to do anymore.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.125
- I just wanna know
what my dad used to do.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.920
Come on, please?

23:43.881 --> 23:47.176
- You normally have success
with that level of please?

23:47.218 --> 23:48.635
- Yes.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.512
Otherwise I wouldn't
continue using it.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.681
- Let's just drive
by, all right?

23:53.766 --> 23:54.975
- Ta da.

23:55.017 --> 23:57.603
(upbeat music)

24:08.614 --> 24:10.783
This place is awesome.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.535
- [Tim] Yep, every weekend,
standing room only.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.288
Lotta energy here, huh?

24:15.329 --> 24:16.414
- Mm hmm.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.165
Hey Merle.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.833
Whatcha doing here?

24:19.875 --> 24:22.669
- Uh, I come here
almost every weekend.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.588
Everybody does except
for your uncle.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.386
- Well I'm certainly
glad to see him.

24:30.428 --> 24:31.845
Hey Tim.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.307
- How you doing, Loretta?

24:34.348 --> 24:35.975
This is Ellie, by the
way, she's my niece.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.226
She's staying with
me for the summer.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.061
- Well hello young lady.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.478
Welcome to Petaluma.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.148
- Thank you, thank you.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.399
- You know we should
probably get inside,

24:43.441 --> 24:45.276
they're getting ready to start.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.236
- We actually just stopped by
to take a look at the track.

24:47.278 --> 24:48.279
You guys go ahead.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.030
- Oh no, we should go in.

24:50.072 --> 24:51.573
- No, Loretta, we don't
have tickets or anything.

24:51.615 --> 24:52.992
- Oh we got plenty of seats.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.535
Come with me.
- Loretta, El!

24:55.577 --> 24:57.455
- We're going.

24:57.495 --> 24:59.248
- [Announcer] Need some
strategy here driving.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.499
There is some speculation
this weekend by some people.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.378
(engines revving)

25:08.132 --> 25:10.926
(crowd cheering)

25:15.931 --> 25:17.724
- This place was
our whole world.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.851
- [Announcer] 23
holds onto the lead

25:18.892 --> 25:20.311
coming out of curve number two.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.272
- It was?

25:23.314 --> 25:25.691
- We spent every
waking moment here.

25:27.525 --> 25:32.281
If we weren't racing we
were watching, studying.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.200
- Studying.

25:35.659 --> 25:36.785
Doesn't look that hard.

25:36.827 --> 25:39.372
I mean you just go in circles.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.542
- Yeah.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.712
You just go in circles.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.088
About 90 miles an hour.

25:50.007 --> 25:52.968
And if you make
one tiny mistake,

25:54.761 --> 25:57.473
the only forgiveness
to be had is dealt out

25:57.515 --> 26:00.393
by a concrete wall
about five feet away.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.188
- Tell me more.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.107
- [Announcer]
Number 22 with Reed,

26:07.149 --> 26:09.109
trying to take
over Hendrix in 27.

26:10.528 --> 26:12.863
- It's the only thing
I've ever done in my life

26:14.240 --> 26:17.159
where when you're doing it it's
the only thing that matters.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.829
(engines revving)

26:20.871 --> 26:21.997
- [Announcer] And
that's the white flag,

26:22.039 --> 26:23.623
only one lap to go.

26:27.711 --> 26:28.670
(whistling)

26:28.712 --> 26:29.671
- What is that smell?

26:29.713 --> 26:31.465
- That's methanol.

26:31.507 --> 26:34.676
These babies don't run on
pump gas, special race gas.

26:34.718 --> 26:38.680
Ah, okay they locked the
gate to the parking lot.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.558
I'm gonna have to
go around the side.

26:41.475 --> 26:43.519
Stay here, I'll get the car.

26:43.561 --> 26:45.729
Tommy, keep any eye on my niece.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.813
They locked the gate.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.023
I'm gonna go pick
up the car, okay?

26:48.065 --> 26:48.815
Thank you.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.192
- [Tommy] Sure thing, Tim.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.112
See that tire on there.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.154
- This is so cool.

26:55.155 --> 26:57.157
Oh my god.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.867
- Ah yeah, I see that.
- Wow.

26:58.909 --> 26:59.993
- I see that.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.871
- [Man In Truck] Need
a ride, little lady?

27:02.913 --> 27:07.709
- Uh, no, I'm just
waiting for my uncle.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.670
- So you don't wanna ride
with tonight's big winner?

27:11.922 --> 27:13.591
- Did you race tonight?

27:13.631 --> 27:15.217
- (laughs) Yeah.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.885
And I won.

27:16.927 --> 27:19.430
- You're kidding.
Are you Buck McCreadie?

27:19.472 --> 27:21.390
- That's my name,
don't wear it out.

27:21.432 --> 27:22.391
- [Ellie] I got a question.

27:22.433 --> 27:23.850
- Huh?

27:23.892 --> 27:26.395
- Is it really so hard
to just race in circles?

27:26.437 --> 27:28.230
- That's the hardest
kinda racing there is.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.442
- That seems to be
the standard response.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.526
- What was that?

27:33.402 --> 27:34.445
- Nothing.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.282
- It's your first time
to the race track?

27:38.324 --> 27:40.451
- Yeah, I live in Monterey.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.203
I'm just visiting
Petaluma for the summer.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.913
- You should let me show
you around town then.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.957
- Is there really much to see?

27:46.999 --> 27:48.459
- Is there much?

27:48.501 --> 27:51.253
Darlin', Petaluma has
all the hot spots.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.380
We got a Waffle House,
less than 20 miles away.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.756
(Ellie laughs)
Cracker Barrel under 30.

27:54.798 --> 27:58.010
- Oh Cracker Barrel, yeah.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.094
- [Tim] El, you good?

27:59.970 --> 28:01.388
- Yeah.

28:01.430 --> 28:02.806
I just met the king
of the oval track.

28:04.308 --> 28:05.184
- Yeah?

28:05.225 --> 28:07.227
Is that what he told ya?

28:07.269 --> 28:08.562
- You know it's true, Tim.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.273
- What are you doing

28:11.315 --> 28:12.441
slumming around the old
Petaluma track, Buck?

28:12.483 --> 28:13.651
- Just keeping my skills sharp.

28:13.691 --> 28:15.777
Racing Calistoga next weekend.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.154
- I thought your whole family

28:17.196 --> 28:18.738
was banned from
Calistoga Speedway

28:18.780 --> 28:20.324
after your old man got
DQed so many times.

28:21.492 --> 28:22.826
- You throwing shade
at my dad, Tim?

28:23.952 --> 28:25.954
Won a lot more trophies
than you ever did.

28:25.996 --> 28:27.289
Though yours do look real nice

28:27.331 --> 28:29.082
sitting in that garage of yours.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.000
(chuckles)

28:30.042 --> 28:31.210
Nice to meet you, Ellie.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.836
- You too.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.422
- She's 16.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.216
- Yeah, and I'm 19.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.800
That used to be marrying age.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.052
- Back off.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.305
- All right Tipsy Tim.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.892
(laughing)

28:48.310 --> 28:49.728
- He seemed nice.

28:49.769 --> 28:51.271
- Oh Ellie, come on.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.732
- Well he seemed nice
until you go there.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.568
What, do you have
history with Buck?

28:56.610 --> 28:58.320
- Nothing other than the
fact that I used to race

28:58.362 --> 28:59.363
with his old man.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.908
- Is he the reason why you quit?

29:02.949 --> 29:04.993
- 'Cause of Buck's idiot father?

29:05.035 --> 29:06.161
I didn't give two
shits about him.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.913
- Oh yeah, sure.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.122
Doesn't sound like it.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.250
- Well, that's the truth.

29:14.712 --> 29:18.006
- Can you tell me more
about the racing or my dad?

29:18.048 --> 29:19.383
You guys were close, right?

29:21.801 --> 29:22.886
- El, there's gotta be a reason

29:22.928 --> 29:24.096
your mother never brought it up.

29:24.137 --> 29:24.930
- What?

29:24.971 --> 29:26.056
What reason?

29:26.098 --> 29:27.558
- I don't know, you'd
have to ask her.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.268
- No, I'm asking you.

29:29.309 --> 29:33.105
- Look, Ellie, I'm really
glad that you're here.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.148
And I have loved every minute

29:35.190 --> 29:37.359
of getting to know my
brother's little baby.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.570
But I can't read
your mother's mind.

29:39.612 --> 29:41.196
(gasps)

29:41.238 --> 29:42.155
- Are you okay?

29:42.197 --> 29:43.240
- I'm gonna stop.

29:47.953 --> 29:50.122
(panting)

29:52.499 --> 29:54.084
That's gotta be something I ate.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.296
- Must've been
everything you ate.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.841
- Would you mind
driving us home?

30:01.883 --> 30:04.470
- What good's a license
if I don't use it?

30:04.511 --> 30:05.596
- Good point.

30:23.405 --> 30:24.490
Thanks for driving, huh?

30:24.531 --> 30:25.699
- [Ellie] Yeah.

30:25.741 --> 30:26.784
You gonna be all right?

30:26.825 --> 30:28.243
- Yeah, yeah, I'm just gonna

30:28.285 --> 30:30.120
grab a couple things
outta the office.

30:40.088 --> 30:43.008
(thoughtful music)

30:51.725 --> 30:53.268
- Thanks for tonight, Tim.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.896
I really loved the racing.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.442
- Yeah.

31:00.484 --> 31:01.819
I used to as well.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.029
'Night El.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.139
- Mornin'.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.476
- What are you doing?

31:34.518 --> 31:36.687
- I thought this place
could use a good cleaning.

31:38.021 --> 31:40.148
- What the hell kinda
teenager are you?

31:40.190 --> 31:42.192
- The kind that works here now.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.777
I gotta earn my paycheck.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.574
- Okay, well this just in.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.619
You don't have to
work on Sundays.

31:52.661 --> 31:55.121
- I am not taking
my first day off.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.415
Now come on, you too.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.624
I'm not doing
this by myself.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.042
- Well I'm gonna
need a cup of coffee

31:59.084 --> 32:00.502
to keep up with you today.

32:00.544 --> 32:03.171
(Ellie laughs)

32:12.055 --> 32:13.557
(sighs)

32:13.599 --> 32:16.351
- So you had a race car, right?

32:16.393 --> 32:17.770
- I did.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.607
- What happened to it?

32:23.358 --> 32:25.360
- I don't know.

32:25.402 --> 32:27.112
- Is that right?

32:27.153 --> 32:28.822
- That's right.

32:28.864 --> 32:33.076
- 'Cause what is under
that tarp over there, Tim?

32:33.118 --> 32:34.994
- Ellie Lansing, you
stop right where you are.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.288
- [Ellie] I can't
help but notice

32:36.329 --> 32:37.831
this giant massive thing--
- I wouldn't do that

32:37.873 --> 32:38.582
if I were you.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.918
(coughing)

32:42.043 --> 32:43.128
I told you not too.

32:44.755 --> 32:46.757
- This is a race car?

32:46.799 --> 32:48.467
- It's a modified.

32:48.508 --> 32:51.386
I know visually it's an
acquired taste, but it's,

32:51.428 --> 32:52.763
it's exactly what you saw

32:52.805 --> 32:53.806
running last night
at the speedway.

32:53.847 --> 32:54.973
- Did you ever win in it?

32:57.100 --> 32:58.685
- I did, yeah.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.647
As a matter of fact the
car you're looking at

33:01.688 --> 33:03.857
held the Petaluma Speedway
record for quite some time.

33:03.899 --> 33:04.900
- How?

33:04.942 --> 33:06.485
You drop it from a plane?

33:06.526 --> 33:09.529
- (laughs) There's
the old man of yours.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.948
- Yeah?

33:15.118 --> 33:16.244
Does it run?

33:17.788 --> 33:19.164
- Nah, it's pretty much

33:19.205 --> 33:21.166
just a big paperweight
at this point.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.461
- Well can we try
and turn it over?

33:24.503 --> 33:25.504
Where are the keys?

33:26.588 --> 33:27.506
- The keys.

33:28.214 --> 33:29.382
Hmm.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.678
I don't know, actually.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.262
- I call bullshit.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.598
You made this big
decision to quit racing.

33:36.640 --> 33:40.435
And then you carefully
covered up your car.

33:40.477 --> 33:43.271
And then what you just tossed
your keys into the corner?

33:44.690 --> 33:47.066
- Well that's not exactly
how it went down, no.

33:47.108 --> 33:47.985
- Where are they?

33:53.365 --> 33:55.909
- Why don't you check in
the trophies back there.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.870
- Which one?

33:57.911 --> 33:59.496
- Try the smallest one.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.373
- That doesn't really
narrow it down for me.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.708
(Tim laughs)

34:02.749 --> 34:03.709
- Son of a.

34:11.008 --> 34:12.050
Ellie.

34:12.091 --> 34:13.593
- It is in none of those.

34:13.635 --> 34:14.803
- Come here, come here.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.348
That's a race car.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.725
- Yeah?

34:19.766 --> 34:20.976
- It's not your
momma's Mercedes.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.271
Doesn't have keys, doesn't
have a blip, blip, blip.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.857
No keyless entry, there's no--

34:26.899 --> 34:28.441
- Okay.
- Six.

34:28.483 --> 34:29.818
- Okay, okay,
- disc changer in the trunk.

34:29.860 --> 34:30.944
- You're real funny,
you know that?

34:30.986 --> 34:32.612
How do I start it?

34:34.531 --> 34:36.658
- Well just to turn it over
it's gonna need a new battery.

34:36.700 --> 34:37.993
No telling what else
is wrong with that.

34:38.035 --> 34:40.537
- Okay, well let's
get it a battery.
- Shh.

34:40.579 --> 34:44.708
Just the adult needs
a minute, okay?

34:44.750 --> 34:47.002
Plus we have another
car to work on.

34:47.044 --> 34:48.378
Think you're gonna like this.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.797
♪ Wake up, today's the day ♪

34:50.839 --> 34:52.591
♪ We gotta get things underway ♪

34:52.632 --> 34:54.051
- Okay.

34:55.385 --> 34:56.511
That should do it.

34:56.553 --> 34:57.971
Twist it.
- Yeah?

34:58.013 --> 35:00.515
(engine revs)

35:03.894 --> 35:05.604
- Okay kill it, kill it.

35:05.645 --> 35:08.106
Whoo!
- Oh!

35:08.147 --> 35:10.233
Tim that sounded amazing.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.484
What is this?

35:11.526 --> 35:13.570
- That is a Chevy LS9.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.197
Pretty much the holy grail
of street power plants.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.116
- Must be for a very
special customer.

35:20.744 --> 35:21.620
- Very.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.373
I gotta tell you, you're
turning out to be a gear head.

35:25.415 --> 35:26.541
Mighta found your calling.

35:26.583 --> 35:27.459
- Yeah?

35:28.627 --> 35:31.296
So can we work on
the race car next?

35:34.257 --> 35:36.259
- You ever think of anything
else, anything at all?

35:36.301 --> 35:37.302
- Not today I don't.

35:37.343 --> 35:38.386
- What about food?

35:38.428 --> 35:39.763
Can I interest you in some food?

35:39.805 --> 35:41.180
- If we must.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.058
God, where's Merle
when ya need him?

35:43.100 --> 35:45.936
- Well Merle's probably still
nursing a nacho hangover.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.692
- So why'd you stop racing?

35:52.734 --> 35:54.402
- Oh really?

35:54.444 --> 35:57.990
- Okay, when did
you stop racing?

35:58.031 --> 35:59.032
- You're relentless, aren't you?

35:59.074 --> 36:00.784
Like a dog with a bone.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.328
(Ellie barks)

36:06.205 --> 36:08.125
I stopped after your
dad died, you know.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.627
- But you loved it,
you said so yourself.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.755
- Yeah well I did then I didn't.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.140
- Hey, dirt track.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.850
Let's check it out.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.893
- Nothing to check
out, it's closed.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.645
- I just wanna see
it during the day.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.480
Please?

36:33.025 --> 36:34.609
- What the hell, but
then after we eat.

36:34.651 --> 36:35.694
Okay?
- Yeah.

36:37.403 --> 36:39.865
(horn honks)

36:41.324 --> 36:43.035
- How you doing, Rocko?

36:43.076 --> 36:44.661
Just gonna show the kid
around if that's all right.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.039
- You're good, Tim.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.581
- Thanks, buddy.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.126
(engine revs)

36:55.672 --> 36:58.133
(tense music)

36:58.175 --> 36:59.176
- What are we doing?

37:00.635 --> 37:02.762
- Well you said you wanted
to see the track, right?

37:05.724 --> 37:06.641
So what the hell.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.267
Let's see the track.

37:08.309 --> 37:10.228
(rock music)
(Ellie exclaims)

37:10.269 --> 37:12.522
(laughing)

37:18.153 --> 37:19.404
- Whoo!

37:23.616 --> 37:25.785
(screams)

37:28.788 --> 37:29.706
Okay, okay.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.171
- So what do ya think?

37:36.213 --> 37:37.756
- Can we do it again?

37:37.797 --> 37:39.049
- Why not?

37:40.133 --> 37:41.509
Your turn.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.261
- What?

37:43.302 --> 37:45.304
- What good's a driver's license
if you're not gonna use it?

37:45.346 --> 37:46.431
Swap spots.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.522
Drop it in first, go
easy on the clutch.

37:54.564 --> 37:57.192
Just easy, delicate on the gas.

38:00.237 --> 38:01.529
There ya go, there ya go.

38:01.571 --> 38:02.906
Feel it.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.532
There's a lotta
power, so go easy.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.120
Up to second before the corner.

38:08.161 --> 38:13.166
- [Ellie] Okay.

38:15.085 --> 38:18.255
- Looks nice, El, that's
beautiful, El, beautiful.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.977
(whimpers)

38:34.312 --> 38:35.521
Yeah!

38:41.236 --> 38:43.488
- Who the hell's that?

38:43.529 --> 38:45.657
- I think it's Tim
Lansing's old car

38:45.698 --> 38:47.867
or pieces of it anyway.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.077
- I think you're right.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.497
Let's have some fun.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.250
- Brakes, brakes,
brakes, brakes.

38:55.292 --> 38:57.335
- We're good, we're good.

38:58.670 --> 38:59.921
- Whoo hoo hoo!

39:01.173 --> 39:04.301
- Wouldn't you know that's Buck.

39:04.342 --> 39:07.595
(guys laughing)

39:07.637 --> 39:08.805
- Think we can take him?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.015
- Maybe 30 years ago when

39:10.056 --> 39:11.308
this rolled off the
assembly line.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.267
Not now.

39:13.268 --> 39:15.520
- Yeah, yeah buddy, come on.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.438
- Catch 'em, catch 'em.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.196
- Come on, old man,
let's see what you got.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.281
- [Tim] All right,
enough of this crap.

39:26.323 --> 39:27.490
Lose him.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.952
(engines revving)

39:30.994 --> 39:32.329
- Yeah, here we go.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.163
Okay, okay.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.331
Yep, yep, yep.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.418
- All right, all
right, all right.

39:42.255 --> 39:44.341
- Stay on your line,
keep him in sight.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.803
- Okay, you gotta catch him,
catch him, now catch him.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.140
- All right, so roll on
the power, up to third,

39:52.182 --> 39:53.432
up to third, up to third.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.477
- Old man's still
got some skills.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.648
- Now it ain't worth hurting
your truck, now Buck.

40:00.690 --> 40:01.774
Easy takes it.

40:01.816 --> 40:02.984
- That's what insurance is for.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.194
- Okay.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.575
- Yes, El!

40:17.249 --> 40:18.499
El.

40:18.541 --> 40:19.625
- I lost him.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.295
- He's high and wide, El.

40:22.337 --> 40:23.338
High and wide.

40:23.380 --> 40:24.214
Son of a.

40:24.256 --> 40:25.048
Gonna hit us, El.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.674
Brakes.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.509
- What are you doing, Buck?
Buck, Buck, Buck.

40:39.771 --> 40:45.402
- Hey, you okay?

40:45.443 --> 40:46.569
- Yeah, we're fine.

40:46.611 --> 40:47.695
- Both of ya?

40:47.737 --> 40:49.447
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:49.488 --> 40:51.824
- You watch yourself and
that diving late apex crap.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.243
You understand me?

40:56.537 --> 40:57.747
- Hey.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.082
Who the hell was driving?

41:03.962 --> 41:06.881
- Hey, aren't you the
king of the oval track?

41:06.923 --> 41:08.425
- No shit.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.093
- Why don't you bring
that car by the shop

41:10.135 --> 41:12.178
and we'll see if we can't
buff that out for ya.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.437
- That was a girl.

41:21.354 --> 41:22.647
- Yeah, no shit, Kenny.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.108
- Wow.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.319
(Buck sighs)

41:27.360 --> 41:28.778
- [Ellie] Did you see his face?

41:28.820 --> 41:30.655
- Why don't you
swing by the shop

41:30.696 --> 41:32.157
and let me buff it out?

41:32.198 --> 41:33.283
I almost peed myself.

41:33.325 --> 41:35.660
(laughing)

41:35.701 --> 41:38.330
You are more like your dad
than I could've imagined.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.207
- What do you mean?

41:41.249 --> 41:42.959
- Oh, he never backed
down from a fight.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.710
Even once he knew
he couldn't win.

41:44.752 --> 41:48.089
I mean I got more bumps and
bruises and scraped up knuckles

41:48.131 --> 41:50.091
than you could
imagine defending him.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.260
(thoughtful music)

41:52.302 --> 41:54.179
- Is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

41:56.597 --> 41:57.682
- I don't know.

41:59.976 --> 42:01.186
Maybe it's just a thing.

42:07.317 --> 42:08.318
- Okay.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.861
Now I'm starving.

42:17.576 --> 42:20.579
(patrons murmuring)

42:22.457 --> 42:24.292
- [Tim] Okay.

42:24.334 --> 42:25.751
- [Hostess] Hi Tim,
nice to see you.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.253
- [Tim] Good to
see you too, Grace.

42:27.295 --> 42:28.754
All righty.

42:28.796 --> 42:29.881
- You should race again.

42:31.174 --> 42:33.551
- Let's just enjoy
what happened today

42:33.592 --> 42:35.970
and let's leave it there.
That's my suggestion.

42:36.012 --> 42:37.514
- I could be on your race team.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.723
Help you fix up your car,

42:38.764 --> 42:41.226
we could show Buck what
a real driver can do.

42:41.267 --> 42:43.353
- Racing is behind me, Ellie.

42:43.395 --> 42:45.104
- It doesn't have to be.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.023
- Come on, it's a
young man's sport.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.774
I know that and
I've accepted it.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.235
You need to accept it.

42:51.861 --> 42:56.074
- Well what about a young woman?

42:59.369 --> 43:00.412
- Oh boy.

43:00.453 --> 43:01.746
- You could be on my race team.

43:01.787 --> 43:03.622
Show me the ropes.

43:03.664 --> 43:06.000
- El you came out here to work
in the shop for the summer.

43:06.042 --> 43:07.377
That's a promise that
I made your mother.

43:07.419 --> 43:09.212
- I can't break that--
- I can still work in the shop.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.089
- We would only race
on the weekends, right?

43:11.130 --> 43:13.049
- Your mother would kill me if
I put you behind the wheel--

43:13.091 --> 43:14.509
- She knows that you race.

43:14.551 --> 43:15.760
It wouldn't be that
big of a surprise.

43:15.801 --> 43:16.886
- No Ellie, El!

43:25.811 --> 43:27.813
Your dad didn't just
die in a car wreck.

43:31.067 --> 43:33.236
He died in a car
wreck on that track.

43:38.366 --> 43:39.617
- My dad raced?

43:42.912 --> 43:45.123
- Yeah your dad raced.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.832
(solemn music)

43:46.874 --> 43:49.127
My brother was the best
friend I've ever had.

43:50.587 --> 43:51.546
We did everything together.

43:51.588 --> 43:52.797
Of course he raced, El.

43:55.091 --> 43:56.217
- What happened?

44:09.105 --> 44:13.610
- He went on his
lid exiting turn two

44:13.651 --> 44:18.239
and we think a fuel line
most likely ruptured

44:18.281 --> 44:20.074
and the car caught on fire.

44:20.116 --> 44:22.118
The flames spread
pretty quickly,

44:22.160 --> 44:24.329
so quick nobody had time
to really do anything.

44:24.370 --> 44:25.538
You know?

44:29.167 --> 44:31.085
(explosion booms)

44:31.127 --> 44:32.003
Nobody had time.

44:36.466 --> 44:38.343
- Why would my mom
keep that from me?

44:40.136 --> 44:41.012
- Oh come on, El.

44:43.515 --> 44:44.807
Your mother was
nine months pregnant

44:44.849 --> 44:45.975
the night it happened.

44:47.143 --> 44:48.603
She was welcoming
you into the world

44:48.645 --> 44:50.980
and saying goodbye to a
husband the same moment.

44:53.525 --> 44:56.235
Your birth is always gonna
be tied to his death.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.906
And I don't think she
ever really had any chance

45:00.948 --> 45:02.617
to process it properly.

45:05.453 --> 45:08.705
I mean I was overwhelmed.

45:08.747 --> 45:10.958
Suddenly the shop was
a one man operation.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.296
Your mother met Vance,
they went to Monterey.

45:15.338 --> 45:17.340
- That's not fair.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.300
It's not fair what she
did to me or to you.

45:19.342 --> 45:21.718
- You can't blame
your mother for that.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.639
What's not fair is losing
a husband that you love.

45:24.681 --> 45:25.890
- Or losing a dad.

45:32.938 --> 45:34.232
- And I'm sorry for that.

45:37.860 --> 45:38.986
- Thank you.

45:42.865 --> 45:46.743
- And that was when your dad
got this perfect opportunity

45:46.785 --> 45:48.745
to pull out the shotgun.

45:48.787 --> 45:49.746
- No way.
- And shoot.

45:49.788 --> 45:50.873
It works too.

45:50.915 --> 45:53.334
Gimme the 15, will ya?

45:53.376 --> 45:55.420
Like scared the crap out them.

45:55.461 --> 45:58.381
I'll tell ya something, they
didn't mess with us ever again.

45:58.423 --> 45:59.507
- How old were they again?

45:59.549 --> 46:03.636
- I mean Otis had to be nine.

46:08.057 --> 46:09.183
Okay.

46:10.602 --> 46:12.395
I don't think there's
anything here we can do

46:12.437 --> 46:14.855
until the differential
ships at least.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.691
- You know what that means.

46:16.733 --> 46:18.025
- Don't say it.

46:18.067 --> 46:19.444
- Race car.

46:19.485 --> 46:20.986
- El, I think we
talked about this.

46:21.028 --> 46:22.614
Neither one of us are
driving that thing.

46:22.655 --> 46:24.365
- Yeah, yeah, we don't have to.

46:24.407 --> 46:27.118
We can just clean out the
cobwebs and tinker with it

46:27.159 --> 46:29.579
when we get home from
being lawyers or whatever.

46:31.788 --> 46:34.166
- Do you remember every single
thing that I say to you?

46:34.208 --> 46:36.335
- Tim, I'm here to work
on cars for the summer.

46:36.377 --> 46:38.379
And I want the next
one to be that one.

46:45.802 --> 46:46.887
(Tim sighs)

46:46.929 --> 46:48.055
- Okay.

46:50.224 --> 46:51.225
Where are you going?

46:53.144 --> 46:55.854
- It needs a new battery,
if I'm not mistaken.

46:55.896 --> 46:59.066
(thoughtful music)

46:59.108 --> 47:00.985
- You are not mistaken.

47:02.361 --> 47:05.698
(engine chugging)

47:05.740 --> 47:06.823
Shut it down.

47:08.493 --> 47:09.910
- Whoo!

47:09.952 --> 47:11.912
Let's get this baby on the road.

47:11.954 --> 47:13.205
- The road?

47:13.247 --> 47:14.873
What kinda car do
you think this is?

47:14.915 --> 47:16.542
This baby runs on dirt.

47:16.584 --> 47:20.129
- Okay, let's get her dirty.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.255
- [Tim] Okay.

47:21.297 --> 47:23.675
Let's see what this baby can do.

47:23.716 --> 47:25.176
- Who's driving?

47:25.217 --> 47:26.885
- Who do you think is driving?

47:26.927 --> 47:29.597
- Well I don't know, I did
most of the work on her.

47:29.639 --> 47:30.682
- You did most of the work?

47:30.723 --> 47:33.100
- Well I was in the top two.

47:33.142 --> 47:35.102
- Okay, this baby hasn't
seen the dirt in 15 years.

47:35.144 --> 47:37.689
And you think I'm not gonna
be the first one to drive it?

47:39.315 --> 47:40.608
- I could live with that.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.194
- So could I.

47:43.235 --> 47:45.237
- You know it's really
more of a young man's--

47:46.656 --> 47:47.657
What'd you just say?

47:49.283 --> 47:50.618
- Try these on.

47:52.704 --> 47:53.788
See what you can do.

47:58.334 --> 47:59.377
(Tim sighs)

47:59.418 --> 48:00.670
Okay.

48:06.300 --> 48:08.845
Now the mud's pretty
tacky out there.

48:08.885 --> 48:11.597
That means the car's
gonna feel pretty loose.

48:11.639 --> 48:13.932
And as you roll on the power,
the back end's gonna step out

48:13.974 --> 48:15.476
so you be ready for that, okay?

48:15.518 --> 48:16.853
- Yeah.

48:16.893 --> 48:18.020
- Only left turns.

48:18.062 --> 48:19.856
The best left turn

48:19.896 --> 48:22.191
is when the steering wheel's
pointing to the right, okay?

48:23.359 --> 48:25.778
(rock music)

49:12.742 --> 49:14.243
Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

49:14.285 --> 49:15.787
How did that feel?

49:15.828 --> 49:17.580
- [Ellie] Awesome!

49:17.622 --> 49:20.957
- I'll tell ya, you
look good out there.

49:20.999 --> 49:22.334
Really good.

49:22.376 --> 49:24.128
I don't think I've ever
seen that kinda car control

49:24.169 --> 49:26.422
on a first drive in my life.

49:27.882 --> 49:28.758
- [Ellie] That was awesome.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.342
- You're a Lansing.

49:30.384 --> 49:32.344
(sighs)

49:36.348 --> 49:37.974
(Tim grunts)

49:38.016 --> 49:39.894
'Kay, you know what, let's
roll it into bay two.

49:39.936 --> 49:41.813
Give a couple
cranks to the right.

49:43.021 --> 49:46.776
- You know, this is
a great car, Tim.

49:47.693 --> 49:48.903
- I always knew she was.

49:49.779 --> 49:51.196
- Yep.

49:51.238 --> 49:53.532
It's a real shame that
she just has to sit here

49:53.574 --> 49:54.659
in the shop all day.

49:56.452 --> 49:57.912
- El.

49:57.954 --> 50:00.665
- It was built to be
on that track, Tim.

50:00.706 --> 50:01.749
- Ellie, stop.

50:04.460 --> 50:06.838
- It is a genie, Tim.

50:06.879 --> 50:08.673
- I'm sorry, what?

50:08.714 --> 50:12.426
- What you have here is a
magical, all powerful creature

50:12.468 --> 50:15.137
that is just spending
year after year

50:15.179 --> 50:17.431
stuffed in this crappy old lamp.

50:17.473 --> 50:18.933
- You are good.

50:18.975 --> 50:20.768
- Rub the lamp, Tim,
set the genie free.

50:20.810 --> 50:22.603
Let it fly through the dirt.

50:22.645 --> 50:25.606
- Okay there's absolutely
nothing that could convince me

50:25.648 --> 50:27.107
to let you do dirt
track this summer.

50:27.149 --> 50:28.651
I'm sorry, it's--
- Shop open?

50:30.319 --> 50:32.488
- Hey Buck, what
are you doing here?

50:32.530 --> 50:34.615
- Ah, you guys said you
could help out with my truck.

50:34.657 --> 50:35.533
So.

50:36.951 --> 50:37.952
- You paying cash?

50:37.994 --> 50:39.411
- No actually.

50:39.453 --> 50:41.037
The insurance lady
was real sympathetic

50:41.079 --> 50:43.875
when she heard about the
hit and run I suffered.

50:43.916 --> 50:45.001
- Is that right?

50:45.041 --> 50:46.084
- Yep.

50:46.126 --> 50:47.586
This is your old race car here?

50:48.504 --> 50:50.046
- It is.

50:50.088 --> 50:51.924
- You donating it to
a museum or something?

50:51.966 --> 50:54.969
- No, no we took her out in
the old field over there.

50:55.011 --> 50:57.638
She handled so nicely.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.807
- Real nice for
a relic I'm sure.

50:59.849 --> 51:01.266
You know you should take my car

51:01.308 --> 51:02.643
out for a few laps
around the track.

51:02.685 --> 51:03.895
You're a pretty good driver.

51:03.936 --> 51:05.103
- You think?

51:05.145 --> 51:06.480
- Yeah.

51:08.315 --> 51:10.860
- You know I think we're all
good with the relic here Buck.

51:10.902 --> 51:12.737
Thanks for dropping by.

51:12.778 --> 51:14.906
I'll let you know
about your truck.

51:14.947 --> 51:15.823
(horn honking)

51:15.865 --> 51:17.115
- Yeah, I'm coming.

51:17.157 --> 51:18.743
- Your mom waiting for you?

51:18.784 --> 51:20.369
- No, Kenny's giving
me a ride home.

51:20.411 --> 51:21.954
I meant what I said earlier

51:21.996 --> 51:24.415
about you trying
out a real race car.

51:24.456 --> 51:25.416
You just let me know.

51:26.751 --> 51:28.753
Possibly get us access
to Calistoga Speedway.

51:28.794 --> 51:30.379
- Shut up!

51:30.421 --> 51:31.714
- Mm hmm.

51:31.756 --> 51:34.258
- I mean no, thank you.

51:35.259 --> 51:36.802
I wanna earn my trip there.

51:36.844 --> 51:38.262
- All right then.

51:38.303 --> 51:40.096
Suit yourself.

51:40.138 --> 51:41.640
Hey, I need it by Friday, Tim.

51:44.100 --> 51:45.895
- I'll see what I can do.

51:45.937 --> 51:49.857
- Maybe spend a little less
time on your stupid race car

51:49.899 --> 51:51.316
and a little more
time working, huh?

51:53.109 --> 51:54.152
(horn honking)

51:54.194 --> 51:55.863
Yeah, I said I'm coming, Kenny.

51:55.905 --> 51:56.989
Bye Ellie.

51:57.031 --> 51:57.990
- [Ellie] Bye Buck.

52:02.787 --> 52:05.205
- Gotta make sure it's
okay with your mom first.

52:06.248 --> 52:07.792
- Yes, thank you.

52:07.833 --> 52:09.418
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

52:09.460 --> 52:11.336
- Okay, there's no
guarantees here, all right?

52:11.378 --> 52:13.338
We're just gonna take
a little bit of time

52:13.380 --> 52:15.507
and see if we can get you ready.
That's it.

52:15.549 --> 52:16.801
- Oh I'm prepared.

52:16.842 --> 52:18.302
I'm ready.
- This is up to you.

52:18.343 --> 52:20.304
- I got the best
teacher in the world.

52:20.345 --> 52:21.179
- Ya think?

52:21.221 --> 52:22.389
(Ellie laughs)

52:22.431 --> 52:25.141
(hopeful music)

52:49.875 --> 52:51.127
- Okay, let's get
you registered,

52:51.167 --> 52:53.045
get you past tech inspection,

52:53.087 --> 52:55.756
pay a quick fee and
get you some seat time.

52:57.716 --> 53:00.552
(energetic music)

53:04.140 --> 53:05.223
Okay.

53:06.892 --> 53:08.393
First of all this is
not an open field.

53:08.435 --> 53:10.437
There's walls here.

53:10.479 --> 53:13.691
Let's just take it
slow at first, okay?

53:17.569 --> 53:19.321
- Who the hell am I kidding?

53:19.363 --> 53:20.865
You're gonna put your foot
through the floorboard

53:20.906 --> 53:22.324
as soon as you get
out there aren't you?

53:22.366 --> 53:23.199
(Ellie laughs)

53:23.241 --> 53:24.409
Get in the car.

53:33.919 --> 53:36.714
(engine rumbles)

53:39.175 --> 53:41.343
(upbeat music)

53:41.385 --> 53:43.888
(engine revs)

53:52.855 --> 53:56.150
(Tim exclaims)

53:56.192 --> 53:57.401
- No, no, no.

53:57.442 --> 53:59.528
(growls)

54:00.779 --> 54:03.741
- Okay well that sucked.

54:03.782 --> 54:04.909
- Yeah.

54:05.826 --> 54:08.620
- Look, I want you
to find the edge.

54:09.496 --> 54:11.582
But do it gradually, okay?

54:11.623 --> 54:12.958
We creep up to the edge.

54:14.168 --> 54:16.837
When you approach the
corner, select your line

54:16.879 --> 54:17.963
and commit to it.

54:18.005 --> 54:19.297
It's a lot easier than later

54:19.339 --> 54:21.008
when there's 10 cars trying
to ram into you, okay?

54:21.050 --> 54:22.760
- Yeah, yeah, got it.

54:24.053 --> 54:25.096
- Make me proud.

54:30.726 --> 54:31.852
(engine rumbles)

54:31.894 --> 54:34.438
(upbeat music)

54:38.734 --> 54:41.445
(engine revving)

55:04.093 --> 55:06.887
Test one two, test one two.

55:06.929 --> 55:08.180
- God?

55:08.222 --> 55:09.807
Is that you?

55:09.848 --> 55:11.976
- Yes, Ellie, as a
matter of fact it is God.

55:12.017 --> 55:13.435
I'd like you to pay attention

55:13.477 --> 55:16.563
to everything your uncle
tells you from now on.

55:16.605 --> 55:17.940
- I'm hanging up on you.

55:17.982 --> 55:19.691
(Tim laughs)

55:19.733 --> 55:22.069
- Okay, I think we're good.

55:22.111 --> 55:24.362
- Yeah, paces, buddy.

55:24.404 --> 55:26.240
- Wow.

55:26.282 --> 55:28.075
I wouldn't have believed it if
I hadn't seen it for myself.

55:28.117 --> 55:29.785
- Buck, what are you doing here?

55:29.827 --> 55:31.620
- Yeah, aren't you supposed
to be up in Calistoga

55:31.662 --> 55:33.497
slamming into a wall?

55:33.538 --> 55:34.372
- That's good.

55:34.414 --> 55:35.666
No, I'm leaving in the morning.

55:35.707 --> 55:36.917
I got a buddy
racing here tonight,

55:36.959 --> 55:38.627
I told him I'd
come check him out.

55:38.669 --> 55:40.087
Now I'm real glad I stayed.

55:41.255 --> 55:43.590
- We got the car in great shape.

55:43.632 --> 55:45.134
- Love the enthusiasm.

55:45.176 --> 55:47.928
Just try and keep
it in one piece.

55:47.970 --> 55:49.305
- Not a problem.

55:49.345 --> 55:50.722
- Yeah, we're all
good here, Buck.

55:50.764 --> 55:53.058
But thanks for dropping by, huh?

55:53.100 --> 55:54.601
- All right.

55:54.643 --> 55:55.686
Good luck out there.

55:56.937 --> 55:58.230
- Thank you.

55:59.857 --> 56:01.233
See?

56:01.275 --> 56:02.442
Told you he was nice.

56:02.484 --> 56:03.610
- Yeah.

56:03.652 --> 56:05.112
Punk that tried to slam

56:05.154 --> 56:06.613
into the side of my
car's a real winner.

56:06.655 --> 56:08.699
- Okay, everyone's
got their flaws, Tim.

56:10.408 --> 56:12.286
- Are you gonna be able
to focus out there?

56:12.328 --> 56:14.663
- Yeah, I got Lansing
blood in these veins.

56:14.705 --> 56:18.042
You tell me. (chuckles)

56:18.083 --> 56:19.626
- Yeah, you'll be fine.

56:19.668 --> 56:22.338
(hopeful music)

56:33.015 --> 56:34.099
- [Announcer] It's a sunny day

56:34.141 --> 56:35.475
here at the Petaluma Speedway.

56:35.517 --> 56:37.811
We're got 40 laps of dirt

56:37.853 --> 56:40.396
sliding and pushing
your cars to the limit.

56:40.438 --> 56:42.774
Now, you've got to
be sharp out there

56:42.816 --> 56:44.735
or you'll end up in the wall.

56:44.776 --> 56:45.736
- Wakey, wakey, El.

56:45.777 --> 56:46.820
How you doing out there?

56:46.862 --> 56:48.530
- I'm not gonna lie.

56:48.572 --> 56:50.241
Got me some jitters.

56:51.283 --> 56:52.743
- Comes with the territory, kid.

56:52.784 --> 56:53.744
How's the car feel?

56:54.828 --> 56:56.247
- Feels good, Uncle.

56:56.288 --> 56:58.040
- Then let's see if she's
still got a little life

56:58.082 --> 56:59.333
left in her, huh?

56:59.375 --> 57:00.667
- [Announcer] Welcome
to this young lady.

57:00.709 --> 57:02.794
Ellie Lansing is car 18.

57:04.129 --> 57:07.383
All right folks, we're
moments away as the green flag

57:07.423 --> 57:08.926
is about to fly.

57:09.927 --> 57:12.388
(rock music)

57:16.308 --> 57:19.061
(engines revving)

57:19.103 --> 57:21.146
- [Ellie] Hey, that
bastard took my line!

57:21.188 --> 57:22.022
- Can't call dibs, kid.

57:22.064 --> 57:22.940
Stay focused.

57:31.073 --> 57:33.242
- [Announcer] 76 with a
nice slide on the inside,

57:33.284 --> 57:34.451
passing rookie Lansing.

57:35.660 --> 57:37.121
- [Ellie] Dammit,
I'm getting passed.

57:37.162 --> 57:38.580
- Don't worry about
the other cars, El.

57:38.622 --> 57:39.957
You're out there learning.

57:44.169 --> 57:45.254
You're sliding wide, kiddo.

57:45.296 --> 57:47.256
Need to slow down the entry.

57:47.298 --> 57:50.801
- Okay.

57:52.344 --> 57:53.304
- [Announcer] The
track's getting slick

57:53.345 --> 57:55.555
as we put in the laps.

57:55.597 --> 57:56.765
- Opportunity'll present itself.

57:56.807 --> 57:58.142
Be patient.

58:01.103 --> 58:03.480
- [Announcer] Nice move
by the rookie in car 18.

58:04.815 --> 58:05.983
- Beautiful, beautiful.

58:13.282 --> 58:15.033
- I can't find an opening.

58:15.075 --> 58:16.701
- That's a Puffer
in front of ya.

58:16.743 --> 58:19.621
It means he can make
himself wide, hard to pass.

58:19.663 --> 58:22.791
- [Announcer] This
is a promising start
for Lansing in 18.

58:22.833 --> 58:24.335
She can drive!

58:24.376 --> 58:25.836
- Good job El, good job.

58:35.262 --> 58:36.221
Down on the power.

58:36.263 --> 58:38.474
- I got it, I got it.

58:44.521 --> 58:45.939
- No, no, no, no.

58:47.649 --> 58:49.109
- [Announcer] Ooh, looks
like young Lansing

58:49.151 --> 58:51.153
in 18 has spun out.
- Oh come on!

58:51.195 --> 58:52.279
- You okay?

58:52.321 --> 58:53.738
- I'm fine.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.073
The clutch is out
but it's not moving.

58:55.115 --> 58:56.574
Something's broken.

58:56.616 --> 58:58.410
- And it appears she's having
trouble with the car now.

58:58.452 --> 59:00.496
- Okay, sit tight
and I'll tow you out.

59:00.537 --> 59:02.331
- [Announcer] Tough
break for the newcomer.

59:02.373 --> 59:03.707
Better luck next time.

59:06.793 --> 59:09.921
(disheartening music)

59:19.556 --> 59:22.351
- Okay, well this column's
definitely stripped.

59:24.520 --> 59:27.022
But I can get it retapped
before next weekend.

59:27.064 --> 59:28.315
- Forget it.

59:30.359 --> 59:31.485
- What was that?

59:31.527 --> 59:32.944
- I said forget it, okay?

59:32.986 --> 59:34.863
I don't know what
I'm doing out there.

59:36.614 --> 59:38.867
- You just got your
license a few weeks ago.

59:38.909 --> 59:40.035
You think you're gonna
miraculously know

59:40.077 --> 59:41.453
how to run on the dirt?

59:41.495 --> 59:43.330
- I thought it'd be easier.

59:43.372 --> 59:45.832
- I thought a lotta
things'd be easier.

59:45.874 --> 59:48.335
Turns out that the things
worthwhile just aren't.

59:55.884 --> 59:57.261
Maybe I was wrong, huh?

59:59.012 --> 1:00:00.013
Maybe we should quit.

1:00:00.055 --> 1:00:01.515
- No, I don't want to.

1:00:01.557 --> 1:00:02.599
- [Tim] What?

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:04.059
- I said I don't want--
- What was that?

1:00:04.101 --> 1:00:05.727
- I said I don't want to, okay?

1:00:05.769 --> 1:00:08.355
I'm just pissed.

1:00:08.397 --> 1:00:09.314
- Hey lady driver.

1:00:12.192 --> 1:00:14.278
- We'll finish this later.

1:00:14.319 --> 1:00:16.029
- Whoo!

1:00:16.071 --> 1:00:17.822
Thought I said you should
keep the car in one piece.

1:00:17.864 --> 1:00:18.990
(chuckles)

1:00:19.032 --> 1:00:20.576
- Oh yeah, you know
I forgot about that.

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:21.826
That was some good advice.

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:23.287
You know next time, McCreadie.

1:00:23.328 --> 1:00:25.205
- So you're gonna
try this again, huh?

1:00:26.081 --> 1:00:27.999
- Yeah, yeah I can't quit now,

1:00:28.041 --> 1:00:29.876
just when I'm getting good.

1:00:29.918 --> 1:00:32.921
- (laughs) Oh you gotta
funny definition of good.

1:00:32.963 --> 1:00:34.756
I think you took four
cars out at once.

1:00:34.798 --> 1:00:36.883
- Don't worry, I told
the insurance lady

1:00:36.925 --> 1:00:38.469
some guy cut me off.

1:00:39.470 --> 1:00:41.721
(laughs)

1:00:41.763 --> 1:00:44.099
- Well you keep plugging
away, lady driver.

1:00:44.141 --> 1:00:47.185
Oh and you know if
this doesn't work out

1:00:47.227 --> 1:00:50.439
maybe you could pose in
a magazine or something.

1:00:50.481 --> 1:00:51.773
Keep that dirt on you.

1:00:51.815 --> 1:00:52.732
It's hot.

1:00:52.774 --> 1:00:54.485
- Back up, Buck.

1:00:54.526 --> 1:00:55.402
Too close to my niece.

1:00:55.444 --> 1:00:56.361
Back up.

1:00:56.403 --> 1:00:57.779
- All right.

1:00:57.821 --> 1:00:59.573
- See you ladies on the podium.

1:00:59.615 --> 1:01:00.740
I'll be the one on top.

1:01:01.992 --> 1:01:04.411
- Definitely starting
to see some flaws.

1:01:04.453 --> 1:01:05.621
- Finally.

1:01:06.622 --> 1:01:08.206
- When do I get to race him?

1:01:08.248 --> 1:01:10.083
- You don't.

1:01:10.125 --> 1:01:12.419
You race modifieds,
he races late models.

1:01:12.461 --> 1:01:14.171
- I don't see that
much of a difference.

1:01:14.212 --> 1:01:15.964
- Yeah well you buy one,
you'll know the difference.

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:19.009
You need a big dog sponsor
for something like that.

1:01:19.050 --> 1:01:20.427
- Well how do I get that?

1:01:20.469 --> 1:01:23.054
- Wins, a lotta wins.

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:26.183
The only currency a sponsor
respects is victory.

1:01:26.224 --> 1:01:27.392
- I can do that.

1:01:27.434 --> 1:01:28.852
What else?

1:01:28.893 --> 1:01:32.147
- (sighs) A team.

1:01:34.024 --> 1:01:35.400
We need a team.

1:01:43.992 --> 1:01:45.369
Easy, Merle.

1:01:45.410 --> 1:01:46.495
- I got it.

1:01:46.537 --> 1:01:48.079
- This is our great race team?

1:01:49.289 --> 1:01:50.957
- Even have an office
coordinator as well.

1:01:50.999 --> 1:01:53.126
Hope you don't mind
sharing your bedroom.

1:01:53.168 --> 1:01:55.795
- Yeah, whatever it takes.

1:01:55.837 --> 1:01:59.174
- Good, because we have six
days 'til the next race.

1:01:59.216 --> 1:02:00.551
- Yeah, can do boss.

1:02:05.096 --> 1:02:06.473
- It's coffee.

1:02:06.515 --> 1:02:07.891
Like I told ya.

1:02:08.892 --> 1:02:10.561
I'm committed as
long as you are.

1:02:15.773 --> 1:02:18.527
Merle, both hands,
buddy, both hands.

- Lunch has arrived.

1:03:44.613 --> 1:03:45.489
- Hey Merle.

1:03:47.532 --> 1:03:49.576
- How come you're not
working on the race car?

1:03:49.618 --> 1:03:52.245
- I still have to
actually earn my living.

1:03:52.287 --> 1:03:53.413
What's that?

1:03:53.455 --> 1:03:56.500
- Oh, Protect the Harvest.

1:03:56.541 --> 1:03:59.210
Nationals at Lucas Oil Speedway.

1:03:59.252 --> 1:04:00.754
- What is that?

1:04:00.796 --> 1:04:02.673
- It's like the
Superbowl of dirt racing.

1:04:03.799 --> 1:04:06.009
Thought we could use
it for motivation.

1:04:06.050 --> 1:04:09.262
- We can put it by
Tim's trophy shrine.

1:04:10.847 --> 1:04:12.307
- Yeah, won't he get mad that?

1:04:12.349 --> 1:04:13.891
- I can handle Tim.

1:04:13.933 --> 1:04:15.560
Come on.

1:04:15.602 --> 1:04:16.812
- [Merle] I bet you can.

1:04:18.855 --> 1:04:19.981
- Will you roll it down?

1:04:20.023 --> 1:04:21.399
- Yeah.

1:04:24.402 --> 1:04:25.195
That looks good.

1:04:25.236 --> 1:04:26.655
- Yeah.

1:04:26.697 --> 1:04:29.199
So I'll see you at
the track tomorrow?

1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:31.159
- Yeah.

1:04:31.201 --> 1:04:32.577
We're gonna win
this time, Ellie.

1:04:34.621 --> 1:04:35.872
Go Team Ellie!

1:04:35.913 --> 1:04:36.998
- Go team!

1:04:45.716 --> 1:04:47.634
Why am I not winning?

1:04:47.676 --> 1:04:48.719
- Gees kid.

1:04:49.678 --> 1:04:50.721
You're young.

1:04:50.762 --> 1:04:51.805
You just started driving.

1:04:51.847 --> 1:04:53.306
Have some patience.

1:04:53.348 --> 1:04:54.683
- No, I've been racing
over a month now.

1:04:54.725 --> 1:04:56.100
- That's nothing.

1:04:56.142 --> 1:04:57.435
Half the kids out
here at the track,

1:04:57.477 --> 1:04:58.936
they've been racing since
their feet could touch

1:04:58.978 --> 1:04:59.979
the pedals on a go-kart.

1:05:00.021 --> 1:05:01.857
- No, I'm missing
something, Tim.

1:05:03.441 --> 1:05:05.943
Or maybe I'm just not as
good as you thought I was.

1:05:07.779 --> 1:05:09.947
- You're better than
I thought you were.

1:05:09.989 --> 1:05:10.990
- Then what's wrong?

1:05:15.203 --> 1:05:17.831
- Kid, there is an
intangible component

1:05:17.873 --> 1:05:19.499
that goes with every dream.

1:05:19.541 --> 1:05:23.712
Sometimes it's desire,
sometimes it's heart,

1:05:23.754 --> 1:05:25.338
sometimes it's making a peace.

1:05:26.548 --> 1:05:28.341
But only you're gonna
know where that is.

1:05:29.801 --> 1:05:31.428
Your dad found it
before I could.

1:05:33.096 --> 1:05:34.389
- He was better than you?

1:05:34.431 --> 1:05:36.099
- Oh god, yeah.

1:05:36.140 --> 1:05:37.809
He coulda driving late
models on the pro circuit

1:05:37.851 --> 1:05:41.688
or anything with a steering
wheel for that matter.

1:05:41.730 --> 1:05:43.106
- Well why didn't he?

1:05:43.147 --> 1:05:44.023
- Finances.

1:05:45.734 --> 1:05:47.569
He had a family to think about.

1:05:47.611 --> 1:05:49.654
Your mom and you
were on the way.

1:05:49.696 --> 1:05:51.072
It's called responsibility.

1:05:53.032 --> 1:05:54.534
- But you think he coulda won?

1:05:57.120 --> 1:05:58.371
- I know he coulda won.

1:05:58.413 --> 1:06:01.332
(thoughtful music)

1:06:06.713 --> 1:06:08.214
- I wanna race late models.

1:06:09.758 --> 1:06:11.843
- Listen Ellie, I
know you want to.

1:06:13.261 --> 1:06:15.179
But it's probably not
gonna happen this summer.

1:06:15.221 --> 1:06:16.973
There's a couple of
variables that are missing.

1:06:17.014 --> 1:06:18.934
Wins and funding.

1:06:21.645 --> 1:06:24.898
- What if I talk to Buck,
see about maybe his sponsors

1:06:24.940 --> 1:06:26.399
coming and taking a look at us?

1:06:26.441 --> 1:06:28.276
- Well why don't you call
the devil while you're at it?

1:06:28.318 --> 1:06:29.360
We could have hell
for a sponsor.

1:06:29.402 --> 1:06:30.695
- Tim.
- No, hey think about this.

1:06:30.737 --> 1:06:32.572
We'd have flames going
down the side of the car,

1:06:32.614 --> 1:06:34.115
horns coming outta the radiator.

1:06:34.157 --> 1:06:35.283
- Tim?
- We'd have a tail

1:06:35.325 --> 1:06:36.785
with a trident--
- Tim!

1:06:36.827 --> 1:06:38.202
- Don't interrupt me. I think
we're onto something here.

1:06:38.244 --> 1:06:41.748
- Your nose is bleeding.

1:06:41.790 --> 1:06:45.585
- Ah yeah, that's
probably the dry weather.

1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:48.672
Listen, you better
get some sleep.

1:06:48.713 --> 1:06:49.881
We got a race tomorrow.

1:06:51.382 --> 1:06:52.175
- You okay?

1:06:52.216 --> 1:06:54.010
- Yeah.

1:06:54.051 --> 1:06:55.720
I don't think I'm gonna bleed
out before daylight, okay?

1:06:55.762 --> 1:06:57.180
Get some sleep.

1:06:58.264 --> 1:06:59.724
- Okay.

1:06:59.766 --> 1:07:00.934
Goodnight.

1:07:00.976 --> 1:07:03.561
(upbeat music)

1:07:16.825 --> 1:07:19.118
- [Announcer] As we enter lap
20 this is turning out to be

1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:20.787
quite a night of racing.

1:07:20.829 --> 1:07:22.706
- You're looking really
smooth out there, El.

1:07:22.747 --> 1:07:24.374
You eat your Wheaties
this morning?

1:07:24.415 --> 1:07:26.751
- My dad spoke to me
in a dream last night.

1:07:26.793 --> 1:07:28.127
Gave me the secret.

1:07:28.169 --> 1:07:29.379
- Yeah, what did he say?

1:07:30.547 --> 1:07:32.131
- [Ellie] Wouldn't
you like to know?

1:07:32.173 --> 1:07:33.758
- [Announcer] The track
is finally slicking up

1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:37.136
as everyone's flying
through the turn.

1:07:37.178 --> 1:07:40.557
Number 18, Ellie Lansing
looking to make a move.

1:07:40.598 --> 1:07:43.518
(engine revs)

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:48.523
(metal crunching)
(crowd exclaiming)

1:07:49.691 --> 1:07:51.234
Looks like a caution
flag out there.

1:07:53.152 --> 1:07:55.613
Henson and Flanders
had a small collision

1:07:55.655 --> 1:07:58.992
just before turn one, coming
outta the straight away.

1:08:01.411 --> 1:08:03.204
We're gonna make
sure they're okay.

1:08:07.834 --> 1:08:09.753
Once the cars are
cleared to the infield,

1:08:09.794 --> 1:08:12.338
the race can get back underway.

1:08:12.380 --> 1:08:15.258
(engines revving)

1:08:17.134 --> 1:08:19.178
That's the green flag,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:08:19.220 --> 1:08:21.305
And we're back in action.

1:08:22.849 --> 1:08:23.641
- Go Ellie!

1:08:23.683 --> 1:08:26.436
(Loretta cheers)

1:08:29.272 --> 1:08:33.192
- [Announcer] There's another
pass by young Lansing.

1:08:33.234 --> 1:08:35.361
Lansing's now in
podium position!

1:08:35.403 --> 1:08:37.572
- Beautiful El, beautiful.

1:08:41.158 --> 1:08:42.368
You got two to
wide, three to check

1:08:42.410 --> 1:08:43.828
and you're P3.

1:08:43.870 --> 1:08:45.121
Could be your first podium.

1:08:45.162 --> 1:08:47.082
Hold onto it.

1:08:47.123 --> 1:08:49.667
- There are two other spots
in that podium you know.

1:08:49.709 --> 1:08:51.210
- That a girl, Ellie.

1:08:51.252 --> 1:08:53.838
(upbeat music)

1:08:58.593 --> 1:09:00.845
(clinking)

1:09:03.098 --> 1:09:05.850
Okay El, stick
your nose up high.

1:09:11.522 --> 1:09:13.108
Low, low, low, low,
low, low, clear.

1:09:13.149 --> 1:09:14.776
Clear, clear.

1:09:14.818 --> 1:09:17.194
- Josie in the lead,
but Lansing closing in.

1:09:17.236 --> 1:09:18.863
- All right, come on Ellie!

1:09:18.905 --> 1:09:20.197
- Come on Ellie!

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:24.035
- Inside, El.

1:09:32.961 --> 1:09:36.006
(crowd cheers)

1:09:36.047 --> 1:09:37.924
Come on!

1:09:37.966 --> 1:09:42.261
- [Announcer] Looks like it's
gonna be sprint to the finish.

1:09:45.056 --> 1:09:47.058
And there's the checker!

1:09:47.851 --> 1:09:49.185
Josie in first,
(cheering)

1:09:49.226 --> 1:09:50.728
Lansing in second.
- Yeah, second!

1:09:50.770 --> 1:09:52.022
- [Announcer] Followed
by Henson in third.

1:09:52.063 --> 1:09:53.023
- Ellie, good run!

1:09:53.064 --> 1:09:54.149
- She did it.

1:09:57.485 --> 1:09:58.444
- You got a lotta heart.

1:09:58.486 --> 1:09:59.403
You ran a great race.

1:09:59.445 --> 1:10:00.864
- Thanks, you too.

1:10:00.905 --> 1:10:02.323
- [Announcer] Let's
hear it folks,

1:10:02.365 --> 1:10:05.535
for our second place
finisher, Ellie Lansing.

1:10:05.576 --> 1:10:09.080
(cheering and applauding)

1:10:11.666 --> 1:10:14.210
- And our first place finisher,

1:10:14.251 --> 1:10:16.671
let's hear it for Brian Josie.

1:10:16.713 --> 1:10:20.091
(cheering and applauding)

1:10:20.133 --> 1:10:23.053
(thoughtful music)

1:10:37.859 --> 1:10:39.276
- I have cake.

1:10:39.318 --> 1:10:40.319
- What?

1:10:40.361 --> 1:10:41.821
Why?

1:10:41.863 --> 1:10:45.033
- Uh, my mom was so
impressed last night

1:10:45.075 --> 1:10:47.827
she wanted to make you
a little something.

1:10:47.869 --> 1:10:49.245
- Let me see.

1:10:50.580 --> 1:10:52.832
Aw, that's so cute.

1:10:52.874 --> 1:10:53.958
- I know, right?

1:10:55.043 --> 1:10:56.794
Smells good.

1:10:56.836 --> 1:10:58.671
You got it pretty good, Ellie.

1:10:58.713 --> 1:10:59.589
- Yeah?

1:10:59.630 --> 1:11:00.631
- Yeah.

1:11:00.673 --> 1:11:02.633
Racing cars all summer,

1:11:02.675 --> 1:11:04.343
living with Tim.

1:11:04.385 --> 1:11:05.261
Tim!

1:11:06.596 --> 1:11:07.471
It's pretty cool.

1:11:08.472 --> 1:11:09.849
- I guess.

1:11:09.891 --> 1:11:13.477
I just, I wish I
was winning more.

1:11:13.519 --> 1:11:15.271
- This is a winner's
cake, Ellie.

1:11:16.773 --> 1:11:18.357
- But I didn't win, Merle.

1:11:18.399 --> 1:11:20.443
Why is everyone so psyched?

1:11:20.484 --> 1:11:22.028
- You were on a podium.

1:11:22.070 --> 1:11:24.739
- Yeah, but second place
isn't winning though.

1:11:27.033 --> 1:11:28.534
- Ellie you don't have to be

1:11:28.576 --> 1:11:31.370
on top of the
podium to win, okay?

1:11:31.412 --> 1:11:32.747
Appreciate what you've got.

1:11:33.957 --> 1:11:35.208
- Who's on the podium?

1:11:36.667 --> 1:11:37.961
- Mom?

1:11:39.545 --> 1:11:40.755
- Congrats, Ellie?

1:11:41.798 --> 1:11:42.966
- No, no, no, Mom.

1:11:44.759 --> 1:11:46.510
- Jess!

1:11:46.552 --> 1:11:48.096
- Ellie's racing?

1:11:49.430 --> 1:11:50.598
- Yes, she's racing.

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:52.349
What are you doing here?

1:11:52.391 --> 1:11:55.394
- I don't need a reason to
come and check on my kid.

1:11:55.436 --> 1:11:57.855
- Listen Jess, I thought you
were aware of her racing.

1:11:57.897 --> 1:11:59.565
There's no way that I--

1:11:59.607 --> 1:12:02.902
- In what world Tim, do I
approve of Ellie Lansing

1:12:02.944 --> 1:12:04.320
racing a car?

1:12:05.822 --> 1:12:07.657
I thought she was
just working here.

1:12:07.698 --> 1:12:10.743
- And she is working
here, very hard.

1:12:11.410 --> 1:12:13.454
We just thought the racing
might be something that she--

1:12:13.496 --> 1:12:16.291
- No, the racing
can't be anything.

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:22.338
- Okay, could you just let
me please talk to Ellie?

1:12:22.379 --> 1:12:24.590
- We will both talk to Ellie.

1:12:24.632 --> 1:12:26.383
- Mom, I'm sorry, okay?
(Tim gasps)

1:12:26.425 --> 1:12:27.260
I didn't.

1:12:27.302 --> 1:12:28.385
I.

1:12:28.427 --> 1:12:29.428
Tim? Tim?

1:12:29.470 --> 1:12:30.387
Mom?

1:12:30.429 --> 1:12:31.639
- Call 911.
- Is he breathing?

1:12:31.681 --> 1:12:32.640
- Tim.
- Tim.

1:12:37.145 --> 1:12:38.813
- [Woman On PA]
Dr. Retkey to OR 1.

1:12:38.855 --> 1:12:40.731
Dr. Retkey to OR 1.

1:12:46.196 --> 1:12:47.530
(Tim sighs)

1:12:47.571 --> 1:12:48.823
- [Jessie] That's
a hell of a way

1:12:48.865 --> 1:12:50.950
to get out of an argument, Tim.

1:12:50.992 --> 1:12:54.329
- Well you know I hate
getting screamed at.

1:12:57.290 --> 1:12:58.415
Hey kid.

1:12:59.583 --> 1:13:00.710
- How are you feeling?

1:13:05.131 --> 1:13:10.094
- Like I got punched in
the gut about 85 times.

1:13:11.304 --> 1:13:13.139
- Doctors say that your
liver function is down

1:13:13.181 --> 1:13:14.807
to about 30%.

1:13:14.849 --> 1:13:16.642
Alcohol related cirrhosis.

1:13:19.103 --> 1:13:20.021
- That's not good.

1:13:22.232 --> 1:13:25.484
- So bed rest,

1:13:25.526 --> 1:13:28.112
lots of meds and we'll see.

1:13:30.198 --> 1:13:32.992
(thoughtful music)

1:13:33.034 --> 1:13:35.536
(siren wails)

1:13:38.081 --> 1:13:39.249
- Jess, you mind if,

1:13:40.624 --> 1:13:43.211
you mind if I talk
to El for a minute?

1:13:47.882 --> 1:13:49.259
- [Jessie] Okay.

1:14:01.771 --> 1:14:03.647
- She's pretty pissed, huh?

1:14:05.066 --> 1:14:08.444
- I don't think there's a word
for just how pissed she is.

1:14:08.485 --> 1:14:11.030
(laughing)
(wincing)

1:14:11.072 --> 1:14:12.198
- Don't make me laugh.

1:14:15.410 --> 1:14:17.661
- I'm sorry I lied to you.

1:14:17.703 --> 1:14:19.747
- You know that's not the point.

1:14:19.789 --> 1:14:21.124
Right?

1:14:23.876 --> 1:14:25.586
You don't lie to family.

1:14:26.337 --> 1:14:27.504
- I know.

1:14:28.381 --> 1:14:30.466
- Look, I screwed up, kid.

1:14:31.384 --> 1:14:32.760
I walked away from my family

1:14:32.802 --> 1:14:35.263
and then my whole
life fell apart.

1:14:35.305 --> 1:14:38.141
But you made me realize
you get one of those.

1:14:39.892 --> 1:14:43.562
That's the most important
thing you'll ever have.

1:14:51.321 --> 1:14:52.655
I love you, kid.

1:14:55.741 --> 1:14:56.867
- I love you too.

1:15:01.789 --> 1:15:03.791
- You do me a favor, all right?

1:15:05.126 --> 1:15:07.295
While you're out there,
if you see a nurse,

1:15:08.712 --> 1:15:11.090
you tell her to use a
smaller needle next time.

1:15:11.132 --> 1:15:13.176
(Ellie laughs)

1:15:13.217 --> 1:15:14.344
- Okay.

1:15:57.678 --> 1:15:59.013
You look so happy there.

1:16:01.557 --> 1:16:02.683
- I was.

1:16:06.312 --> 1:16:08.105
- I wish I could've
seen Dad race.

1:16:10.858 --> 1:16:11.942
- Yeah me too.

1:16:16.030 --> 1:16:19.200
- I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you I was racing.

1:16:21.536 --> 1:16:23.829
- I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about your dad.

1:16:27.041 --> 1:16:29.419
- Tim said he was pretty good.

1:16:29.460 --> 1:16:30.461
- Mm hmm.

1:16:30.503 --> 1:16:31.754
He was the best.

1:16:35.007 --> 1:16:36.175
- Do you ever miss it?

1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:40.763
- I miss him.

1:16:42.598 --> 1:16:46.102
But no, I have a better
life in Monterey.

1:16:46.143 --> 1:16:47.520
For you and me.

1:16:52.358 --> 1:16:54.318
- Tim thinks I'm pretty good.

1:16:56.737 --> 1:16:58.197
(Jessie sighs)

1:16:58.239 --> 1:17:00.032
- Tim doesn't really
know anything else.

1:17:00.074 --> 1:17:01.700
He doesn't know what
other possibilities

1:17:01.742 --> 1:17:03.077
are out there for you.

1:17:03.119 --> 1:17:04.579
- Mom, I think I'm
pretty good too.

1:17:05.913 --> 1:17:08.291
- Ellie, dirt track
racing is not a living.

1:17:08.332 --> 1:17:09.500
It's a side gig.

1:17:10.667 --> 1:17:12.836
And I bet working in
this shop for the summer

1:17:12.878 --> 1:17:14.880
was a whole lot of fun.

1:17:14.922 --> 1:17:17.133
But are you really gonna
spend the next 50 years

1:17:17.174 --> 1:17:19.510
working long hours in a shop

1:17:19.552 --> 1:17:21.220
so you can go race
on the weekend?

1:17:21.262 --> 1:17:22.721
- I don't know.

1:17:22.763 --> 1:17:25.933
You know I don't know
about the next 50 years.

1:17:25.975 --> 1:17:28.394
But I know about right now.

1:17:28.436 --> 1:17:30.104
I know that this matters to me.

1:17:30.146 --> 1:17:32.523
This all matters to me.

1:17:32.565 --> 1:17:35.485
(thoughtful music)

1:17:36.611 --> 1:17:38.862
This is what I
need from you, Mom,

1:17:38.904 --> 1:17:40.364
this is what I actually want.

1:17:44.160 --> 1:17:46.162
(sighs)

1:17:48.205 --> 1:17:50.458
- [Woman On PA] Paging Dr.
Moore, you're needed in post op,

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:54.128
paging Dr. Moore, you're
needed in post op.

1:17:57.214 --> 1:17:59.216
(sighs)

1:18:01.385 --> 1:18:02.803
- What?

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:09.519
- Seven days a week,
this, same stuff.

1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:12.563
What would it take to
get me some grape Jello?

1:18:12.605 --> 1:18:14.815
(laughing)

1:18:16.066 --> 1:18:17.901
- I mean you must
be feeling better

1:18:17.943 --> 1:18:20.696
if this is the biggest
problem you have.

1:18:22.365 --> 1:18:23.699
Grape.

1:18:25.326 --> 1:18:26.827
You ornery old fart.

1:18:30.498 --> 1:18:31.790
- Yeah.

1:18:33.042 --> 1:18:34.877
You're probably right.

1:18:37.254 --> 1:18:38.172
How's Ellie doing?

1:18:40.257 --> 1:18:42.968
- She and Merle have
that shop handled.

1:18:43.010 --> 1:18:44.470
You're gonna be out of a job.

1:18:47.097 --> 1:18:48.391
- Hope they don't fire me.

1:18:49.266 --> 1:18:50.309
I need the insurance.

1:18:55.022 --> 1:18:56.607
You know that
little girl of yours

1:18:56.649 --> 1:18:59.402
is the best thing to
happen to me in 16 years.

1:18:59.443 --> 1:19:02.196
- She's loved every minute
of this summer with you.

1:19:03.614 --> 1:19:05.324
- She gave me some
great memories.

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:09.786
To replace some pretty bad ones.

1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:16.210
- Is she really that good?

1:19:18.087 --> 1:19:19.004
- Hand me my phone.

1:19:28.347 --> 1:19:29.932
Watch that.

1:19:32.602 --> 1:19:34.353
That is her first podium.

1:19:35.521 --> 1:19:37.231
Better than Elliott
and I ever were.

1:19:38.524 --> 1:19:41.527
Her instincts, her car control.

1:19:41.569 --> 1:19:43.446
- Shit.
- Jess you can't teach that.

1:19:49.201 --> 1:19:50.411
- Mm.

1:19:53.163 --> 1:19:55.124
- Can you pass me
a quarter inch?

1:19:55.165 --> 1:19:56.083
- Uh yeah.

1:19:57.543 --> 1:19:59.545
I told Scooter we'd have
this done by tomorrow.

1:19:59.587 --> 1:20:03.299
- Yeah no, I get it,
Scooter wants his car.

1:20:03.340 --> 1:20:05.718
I'm doing the best I can.

1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:06.636
- Hey guys.

1:20:06.677 --> 1:20:07.928
How's it going?

1:20:07.970 --> 1:20:10.389
- Merle is PMSing again.

1:20:10.431 --> 1:20:12.224
- You're the PMSer.

1:20:12.266 --> 1:20:15.269
- Oh well, I don't think
that Scooter's truck's

1:20:15.311 --> 1:20:16.562
gonna get done on time.

1:20:16.604 --> 1:20:17.980
- I told you.

1:20:18.021 --> 1:20:19.565
- Why?

1:20:19.607 --> 1:20:21.942
- 'Cause we have
another car to work on.

1:20:21.984 --> 1:20:24.236
- Mom, we're kinda swamped here.

1:20:24.278 --> 1:20:25.738
- Oh.

1:20:25.780 --> 1:20:27.573
Well I just thought that
when I told my race team

1:20:27.615 --> 1:20:30.534
that we had work to do
that they would hop to.

1:20:32.662 --> 1:20:34.538
- Your race team?

1:20:34.580 --> 1:20:37.082
- Yeah, Tim didn't think it
was the right time to call it.

1:20:37.124 --> 1:20:38.668
So he put me in charge.

1:20:38.709 --> 1:20:40.002
- Mom, seriously?

1:20:40.043 --> 1:20:41.587
You're gonna run the team?

1:20:41.629 --> 1:20:44.674
- Yeah, this was my
world as much as Tim's.

1:20:44.715 --> 1:20:46.383
And I can't think
of a better driver

1:20:46.425 --> 1:20:48.177
I'd like to run
the race team for.

1:20:50.554 --> 1:20:51.930
- [Merle] Yes!

1:20:51.972 --> 1:20:53.307
Thank you!

1:20:53.349 --> 1:20:54.850
- All right, all right.
- Yeah all right. Yeah.

1:20:54.891 --> 1:20:56.059
- We got work to do.

1:20:56.101 --> 1:20:57.812
- We've been working on
Tim's car on the side.

1:20:57.853 --> 1:20:58.771
It's ready to go.

1:20:58.813 --> 1:21:00.564
- Oh.

1:21:00.606 --> 1:21:03.609
Yeah but you, you can't run
Tim's car in late model.

1:21:07.655 --> 1:21:10.949
- But we don't have
a late model car.

1:21:12.326 --> 1:21:14.370
- Mm, uh oh.

1:21:15.538 --> 1:21:18.541
You better not say that
to your new big sponsor.

1:21:18.582 --> 1:21:20.376
- Mom, what's going on?

1:21:22.002 --> 1:21:23.379
Mom, what's going on?

1:21:26.048 --> 1:21:28.467
Mom, Dakota's our new sponsor?

1:21:29.802 --> 1:21:31.679
Vance are you serious?

1:21:31.721 --> 1:21:34.557
Hey munchkin, I missed you.

1:21:34.598 --> 1:21:35.808
- I missed you too.

1:21:35.850 --> 1:21:37.142
- Oh my--
- I made you this.

1:21:37.184 --> 1:21:38.227
- What is this?

1:21:38.268 --> 1:21:40.062
This is amazing.

1:21:40.103 --> 1:21:41.522
Thank you!

1:21:41.564 --> 1:21:44.024
You guys, you guys
bought a late model?

1:21:45.359 --> 1:21:46.985
- All we need now's a driver.

1:21:47.027 --> 1:21:50.113
- You got it, thank you!

1:21:50.155 --> 1:21:51.490
- Our pleasure, El.

1:21:51.532 --> 1:21:53.701
- Oh my god.
- Now who's this guy?

1:21:53.743 --> 1:21:57.120
- This is the brains
of the team, Merle.

1:21:57.162 --> 1:21:58.497
- Nice to meet ya, Earl.

1:21:58.539 --> 1:21:59.707
- It's Merle.

1:21:59.749 --> 1:22:01.166
- It's what?
- It's Merle.

1:22:01.208 --> 1:22:02.334
- Okay.

1:22:02.376 --> 1:22:04.086
Like Merle Haggard.

1:22:04.127 --> 1:22:06.255
- Where are we racing where
we're going to need all of this?

1:22:06.296 --> 1:22:07.798
- Well it's not Petaluma.

1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:10.426
- No, we are entered
in the $100,000 to win

1:22:10.467 --> 1:22:14.513
Protect the Harvest Nationals
at Lucas Oil Speedway.

1:22:14.555 --> 1:22:16.891
- That's the Superbowl
of dirt track.

1:22:16.932 --> 1:22:19.518
- Yes, I mean it's the
biggest race of the season.

1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:21.729
And it's in Wheatland, Missouri.

1:22:21.771 --> 1:22:22.855
- We're going to the Superbowl.

1:22:22.897 --> 1:22:24.022
- We're going to the Superbowl.

1:22:24.064 --> 1:22:24.857
- In Wheatland.

1:22:24.899 --> 1:22:26.108
(girls laughing)

1:22:26.149 --> 1:22:27.984
- All right.
One last thing.

1:22:29.236 --> 1:22:30.780
Are you okay if
I'm your spotter?

1:22:32.531 --> 1:22:35.618
- Female spotter, I don't know.

1:22:36.493 --> 1:22:37.578
- Yeah.

1:22:37.620 --> 1:22:38.746
- What do you think, Merle?

1:22:40.247 --> 1:22:43.041
- You don't listen to anyone
anyway, so what do you care?

1:22:43.083 --> 1:22:44.293
- Oh I like you.

1:22:44.334 --> 1:22:46.128
I like you.

1:22:46.169 --> 1:22:47.671
- Then we're good to go.

1:22:47.713 --> 1:22:49.548
We're good to go!
- Whoo!

1:22:55.930 --> 1:22:56.847
- Hey El.

1:22:56.889 --> 1:22:57.681
- Hey.

1:22:57.723 --> 1:22:58.808
- Hi Rocko.

1:22:58.849 --> 1:23:00.183
Thank you for this.

1:23:00.225 --> 1:23:01.644
- You're welcome.

1:23:02.853 --> 1:23:05.230
This isn't modified, Ellie.

1:23:05.272 --> 1:23:07.065
A late model your
wheelbase is wider

1:23:07.107 --> 1:23:09.777
so it'll handle better but
you got 300 more horsepower

1:23:09.819 --> 1:23:10.903
under the hood.

1:23:10.945 --> 1:23:11.987
You're gonna be
carrying a lot of speed.

1:23:12.028 --> 1:23:13.572
- I think I got it, Mom.

1:23:13.614 --> 1:23:16.283
- Ellie, speed can be dangerous.

1:23:16.325 --> 1:23:18.034
- I understand.

1:23:18.076 --> 1:23:21.747
- Oh, well, you're lucky 'cause
this series allows spotters.

1:23:21.789 --> 1:23:24.541
So get used to listening
to me in your ear.

- Can you had me

1:24:48.042 --> 1:24:49.585
- [Jessie] How's she doing?

1:24:49.626 --> 1:24:51.211
- Fit as a fiddle.

1:24:51.253 --> 1:24:52.671
We're ready to
take on Wheatland.

1:24:52.713 --> 1:24:54.798
- Ah.
- Hi Mom.

1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:56.008
- Hi honey.

1:24:57.217 --> 1:24:59.302
Ellie, I got
something to show you.

1:24:59.344 --> 1:25:01.513
- Okay.
Can you make sure that jay
bar's raised half an inch?

1:25:01.555 --> 1:25:02.806
- I know.

1:25:02.848 --> 1:25:04.600
- Okay.

1:25:04.641 --> 1:25:06.393
What is this?

1:25:06.435 --> 1:25:07.770
- Take a look yourself.

1:25:07.811 --> 1:25:10.773
(thoughtful music)

1:25:14.317 --> 1:25:16.194
- This is Dad's stuff?

1:25:16.236 --> 1:25:18.280
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1:25:25.161 --> 1:25:27.122
Oh my god.

1:25:27.163 --> 1:25:28.999
This is incredible.

1:25:32.586 --> 1:25:35.130
You just held onto all of this?

1:25:35.171 --> 1:25:36.799
- Yeah.

1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:38.675
I don't know when the
last time I looked at is,

1:25:38.717 --> 1:25:41.136
but I didn't get rid of it.

1:25:41.177 --> 1:25:43.097
- Maybe you should've
gotten rid of this one.

1:25:43.138 --> 1:25:45.808
(both laughing)

1:25:48.894 --> 1:25:50.228
Wow.

1:25:53.065 --> 1:25:54.858
I wish I knew him.

1:25:55.985 --> 1:25:57.402
- You do.

1:26:00.447 --> 1:26:01.865
He's in you.

1:26:03.283 --> 1:26:07.871
Every time I look at you
it's his face looking back.

1:26:18.173 --> 1:26:20.383
Okay, I'm not proud of this.

1:26:22.636 --> 1:26:23.595
- What is this?

1:26:25.681 --> 1:26:28.308
- Tim tried to stay
in touch with you.

1:26:28.350 --> 1:26:29.518
But I wouldn't let him.

1:26:31.103 --> 1:26:32.729
- Mom.
- Yeah.

1:26:34.023 --> 1:26:35.190
It was a mistake.

1:26:36.399 --> 1:26:38.027
Think I thought I
was protecting you,

1:26:39.194 --> 1:26:40.904
but I was just
protecting myself.

1:26:43.657 --> 1:26:45.075
- Just look at all of these.

1:26:46.118 --> 1:26:47.703
- One for every birthday.

1:26:49.788 --> 1:26:52.374
- Except when I turned seven.

1:26:52.415 --> 1:26:53.917
- What?

1:26:53.959 --> 1:26:56.419
I saw that one sitting
on top of the mail.

1:26:56.461 --> 1:26:59.214
I took it up to my room and
never told you about it.

1:27:01.133 --> 1:27:02.634
- Can you ever forgive me?

1:27:04.427 --> 1:27:05.971
- Yeah.

1:27:06.013 --> 1:27:07.639
Yeah, of course.

1:27:07.681 --> 1:27:10.266
(gentle music)

1:27:15.105 --> 1:27:17.232
- Gees, it's just mail.

1:27:17.273 --> 1:27:20.027
(both chuckling)

1:27:20.069 --> 1:27:22.696
(upbeat music)

1:27:47.137 --> 1:27:49.389
- Merle?
- Yeah, yeah I got ya.

1:27:49.431 --> 1:27:50.432
- Copy me?

1:27:50.473 --> 1:27:51.767
- [Merle] Loud and clear.

1:27:53.268 --> 1:27:57.898
- There ya go.

1:28:02.152 --> 1:28:05.072
- Lady driver wants to run
with the big boys now, huh?

1:28:05.114 --> 1:28:07.490
- You're not scared,
are you Buck?

1:28:07.532 --> 1:28:09.118
- A little scared you're
gonna crash into me.

1:28:09.159 --> 1:28:10.911
I've seen what you
can do out there.

1:28:12.162 --> 1:28:15.082
- Well, can't crash into
you if I'm ahead of you.

1:28:15.124 --> 1:28:16.583
- You dream that dream.

1:28:16.625 --> 1:28:18.501
Maybe after the race you can
come by the winner's circle

1:28:18.543 --> 1:28:21.421
and we can go out and
celebrate my victory.

1:28:21.880 --> 1:28:24.883
- Sorry, I have other plans.

1:28:24.925 --> 1:28:26.093
- Oh yeah?

1:28:26.135 --> 1:28:27.886
Better than hanging out with me?

1:28:27.928 --> 1:28:29.805
- Oh yeah.

1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:34.392
(Buck laughs)

1:28:34.434 --> 1:28:35.852
- Right.

1:28:35.894 --> 1:28:37.562
You call me when
you're done with Earl.

1:28:37.604 --> 1:28:38.563
- It's Merle.

1:28:40.065 --> 1:28:41.608
Nice work Merle.

1:28:41.650 --> 1:28:43.359
- I didn't really do anything.

1:28:44.278 --> 1:28:45.695
- I know.

1:28:51.285 --> 1:28:52.119
- So who was that?

1:28:52.995 --> 1:28:55.371
- That was Buck McCreadie.

1:28:55.413 --> 1:28:56.248
- Get out.

1:28:56.290 --> 1:28:57.499
- You know him?

1:28:57.540 --> 1:28:59.251
- Oh I know that last name.

1:29:00.794 --> 1:29:02.129
And I know you're gonna need

1:29:02.171 --> 1:29:04.256
to beat the snot
outta him tonight.

1:29:04.298 --> 1:29:05.507
- Can do, boss.

1:29:07.509 --> 1:29:08.927
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1:29:08.969 --> 1:29:10.512
we've reached the
main event tonight,

1:29:10.553 --> 1:29:12.722
here at the spectacular
Lucas Oil Speedway.

1:29:12.764 --> 1:29:13.849
(cheering)

1:29:13.890 --> 1:29:17.102
We've got 100 laps for $100,000

1:29:17.144 --> 1:29:19.313
in the Protect the
Harvest Nationals.

1:29:20.939 --> 1:29:23.317
Locked into that front row
are your top qualifiers,

1:29:23.358 --> 1:29:25.735
Bob Paxton and Jimmy Crunden.

1:29:25.777 --> 1:29:28.697
They'll lead this 32 car
field to the green flag.

1:29:30.032 --> 1:29:30.991
- [Ellie] Can you hear me?

1:29:31.033 --> 1:29:32.450
- Loud and clear.

1:29:32.492 --> 1:29:34.452
Good luck out there, kid.

1:29:34.494 --> 1:29:36.496
- [Announcer] In the
second row, in the 1 car,

1:29:36.538 --> 1:29:38.581
is the talk of the
track this week:

1:29:38.623 --> 1:29:42.085
up and comer Buck McCreadie
out of Petaluma, California.

1:29:42.127 --> 1:29:44.378
He's one of the youngest
racers out here tonight.

1:29:44.420 --> 1:29:47.216
But his lap times this
season have been fantastic.

1:29:53.805 --> 1:29:55.182
(fireworks popping)

1:29:55.224 --> 1:29:56.975
Car advance coming
out of turn four,

1:29:57.017 --> 1:30:00.687
a salute to America, the
greatest country on Earth.

1:30:00.729 --> 1:30:03.523
And to you, the greatest
fans in automobile racing.

1:30:11.281 --> 1:30:14.159
- All right Buck, stay
focused out there.

1:30:14.201 --> 1:30:15.369
- [Buck] Always focused.

1:30:16.578 --> 1:30:18.247
- This is gonna bring
us to the green flag

1:30:18.288 --> 1:30:19.248
for our main event.

1:30:21.083 --> 1:30:22.876
- You got this, kid.

1:30:22.918 --> 1:30:24.711
(engines revving)

1:30:24.753 --> 1:30:26.504
(upbeat music)

1:30:26.546 --> 1:30:28.257
- [Announcer] Box Paxton,
Jimmy Crunden at the line.

1:30:29.507 --> 1:30:30.384
Here we go.

1:30:31.885 --> 1:30:33.387
- [Jessie] You can do it, Ellie.

1:30:33.427 --> 1:30:36.598
Just drive the car.

1:30:36.639 --> 1:30:38.808
- Only five laps in
and Buck McCreadie

1:30:38.850 --> 1:30:40.894
already finds himself
in second place,

1:30:40.936 --> 1:30:42.854
chasing down the leader.

1:30:42.896 --> 1:30:45.439
(tense music)

1:30:47.650 --> 1:30:49.152
Buck McCreadie's
not the only driver

1:30:49.194 --> 1:30:50.612
from Petaluma, California.

1:30:50.653 --> 1:30:53.282
In the middle of the
pack in the 32 car

1:30:53.323 --> 1:30:57.369
is Ellie Lansing, a young
lady who's only 16 years old.

1:30:57.411 --> 1:30:59.955
(tense music)

1:31:03.083 --> 1:31:05.377
Buck McCreadie
takes over the lead.

1:31:05.419 --> 1:31:07.545
- Oh this is your
race to lose tonight.

1:31:07.587 --> 1:31:09.298
- [Buck] You know it.

1:31:11.507 --> 1:31:13.802
- All right El,
track's getting slick.

1:31:19.391 --> 1:31:21.475
- I'm gonna try and
squeeze on the inside.

1:31:25.439 --> 1:31:27.523
- Nothing Ellie Lansing
does here tonight

1:31:27.565 --> 1:31:29.276
seems to be doing any good.

1:31:30.819 --> 1:31:33.613
(metal clanking)

1:31:40.162 --> 1:31:41.663
(metal clanking)

1:31:41.704 --> 1:31:43.748
Oh, Mason Syler and
Jimmy Briggs collide,

1:31:43.790 --> 1:31:45.417
hanging into turn three.

1:31:45.459 --> 1:31:46.542
Looks like everyone's okay

1:31:46.584 --> 1:31:49.754
but a caution flag has come out.

1:31:49.796 --> 1:31:52.590
It's certainly an endurance
test out here tonight, folks.

1:31:52.632 --> 1:31:56.636
Staying clean and green for
100 laps is no easy feat.

1:31:59.264 --> 1:32:00.807
- I think I'm in over my head.

1:32:02.267 --> 1:32:04.811
- All right listen, if you
take away the fancy stadium

1:32:04.853 --> 1:32:06.729
and fireworks, you
know what's left?

1:32:06.771 --> 1:32:08.106
- No, what?

1:32:08.148 --> 1:32:09.232
- A dirt track.

1:32:09.274 --> 1:32:11.360
Same size as the one back home.

1:32:12.361 --> 1:32:14.237
Show me what ya got.

1:32:14.279 --> 1:32:15.197
- You're right.

1:32:16.530 --> 1:32:18.116
Thanks, Mom.

1:32:18.158 --> 1:32:19.742
- With that green flag,
we're back to racing,

1:32:19.784 --> 1:32:20.827
ladies and gentlemen.

1:32:20.869 --> 1:32:23.205
37 in the books, 63 to go

1:32:23.246 --> 1:32:26.540
and Buck McCreadie will
not let go of that lead.

1:32:26.582 --> 1:32:27.959
- Hold your line, Buck.

1:32:28.001 --> 1:32:29.378
- [Buck] Now don't
worry, I got this.

1:32:33.006 --> 1:32:34.757
- [Announcer] McCreadie
with an impressive lap time.

1:32:34.799 --> 1:32:38.387
He's actually starting to
lap some of the competition.

1:32:41.515 --> 1:32:42.974
The 32 car, Lansing,

1:32:43.016 --> 1:32:44.267
with a clean pass on car 5.

1:32:44.309 --> 1:32:45.559
- Yes!

1:33:00.574 --> 1:33:01.743
Damn!

1:33:01.784 --> 1:33:03.286
Found another gear, kid.

1:33:03.328 --> 1:33:05.914
- Just another dirt track, Mom.

1:33:08.582 --> 1:33:10.877
- [Announcer] McCreadie
still out in front.

1:33:10.919 --> 1:33:12.546
But the real story
out here tonight

1:33:12.586 --> 1:33:15.006
is the rookie Lansing in car 32,

1:33:15.048 --> 1:33:19.469
who started in 14th but is
now all the way up to 6th.

1:33:19.511 --> 1:33:21.346
Make that 5th!

1:33:21.388 --> 1:33:23.639
(laughing)

1:33:25.183 --> 1:33:26.351
- All right, 20 laps to go.

1:33:26.393 --> 1:33:28.353
- [Ellie] 20 laps, copy.

1:33:28.395 --> 1:33:30.355
- [Buck's Spotter] Stay sharp,
Buck, this race is yours.

1:33:30.397 --> 1:33:31.523
- [Buck] I ain't worried.

1:33:33.733 --> 1:33:36.528
(engines revving)

1:33:38.238 --> 1:33:41.408
- [Announcer] Lansing in 32
makes another pass on car 20,

1:33:41.450 --> 1:33:43.410
moving up to 4th place.

1:33:48.748 --> 1:33:50.624
- [Jessie] Double
zero on your tail.

1:33:54.254 --> 1:33:55.713
- What's he doing?

1:33:55.755 --> 1:33:57.591
(metal clanking)
- Ooh, the double zero,

1:33:57.631 --> 1:33:59.050
he threw a fender.

1:33:59.092 --> 1:34:00.634
- [Ellie] Hey!

1:34:00.676 --> 1:34:02.804
- [Announcer] The 32 car
almost into the wall.

1:34:02.845 --> 1:34:04.306
But Lansing pulls out of it.

1:34:04.347 --> 1:34:05.765
- I'm good.

1:34:05.807 --> 1:34:07.142
- [Announcer] This young
lady sure can drive.

1:34:07.934 --> 1:34:08.810
- Payback time.

1:34:11.521 --> 1:34:13.189
- [Announcer] Lansing
looking for revenge,

1:34:13.231 --> 1:34:16.067
dive under double zero
to move back into 4th.

1:34:16.109 --> 1:34:17.735
- She's pretty good, huh?

1:34:17.777 --> 1:34:18.820
- She's the best.

1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:24.576
- [Announcer] Lap 87,
McCreadie still unchallenged.

1:34:24.618 --> 1:34:26.578
We're closing on the final 10.

1:34:26.620 --> 1:34:30.540
Can McCreadie shut the door
on the rest of the pack?

1:34:34.294 --> 1:34:37.005
- [Jessie] Are you comfortable
with 4th place young lady?

1:34:37.046 --> 1:34:38.089
- Not tonight.

1:34:38.131 --> 1:34:39.591
My sponsor's in the stands.

1:34:39.633 --> 1:34:40.509
- Whoo!

1:34:44.638 --> 1:34:46.931
- [Announcer] Lansing with a
powerful move on the outside.

1:34:46.973 --> 1:34:49.267
She might claim a podium
spot here tonight.

1:34:49.309 --> 1:34:51.978
- (laughs) Yes!

1:34:52.937 --> 1:34:53.980
(crunching)

1:34:54.022 --> 1:34:55.440
- Oh, that did not look pretty.

1:34:55.482 --> 1:34:57.442
He just came in too
hot and spun him.

1:34:57.484 --> 1:34:59.486
- Six laps to checker, Ellie.

1:34:59.528 --> 1:35:01.279
- [Ellie] Roger that.

1:35:01.321 --> 1:35:03.156
- Buck McCreadie's gotta
be feeling the heat

1:35:03.198 --> 1:35:05.116
from the hard charging
Ellie Lansing,

1:35:05.158 --> 1:35:07.410
who's now right on
his back bumper.

1:35:07.452 --> 1:35:09.412
- [Jessie] You like
following that McCreadie boy?

1:35:09.454 --> 1:35:10.955
- No.

1:35:10.997 --> 1:35:12.666
And I think he's led
this race long enough.

1:35:13.958 --> 1:35:15.251
(laughing)

1:35:15.293 --> 1:35:16.419
- There you go kid.

1:35:16.461 --> 1:35:19.047
(gentle music)

1:35:20.507 --> 1:35:22.050
- After a hard night of racing,

1:35:22.091 --> 1:35:24.511
it's all come down to
these final six laps.

1:35:28.097 --> 1:35:28.973
- Bring her home.

1:35:37.607 --> 1:35:39.108
- Hey El.

1:35:39.150 --> 1:35:40.235
- God?

1:35:40.276 --> 1:35:41.735
Is that you?

1:35:41.777 --> 1:35:43.196
- It's your Uncle Tim here.

1:35:43.238 --> 1:35:44.155
Coming to you in a dream.

1:35:44.197 --> 1:35:45.240
- Oh I see.

1:35:46.241 --> 1:35:47.701
You got a secret for me.

1:35:48.910 --> 1:35:50.744
- [Tim] Yeah, drive
faster than Buck.

1:35:50.786 --> 1:35:54.040
- (laughs) I miss you.

1:35:54.082 --> 1:35:57.669
- I miss you too.

1:35:57.711 --> 1:35:59.962
- [Announcer] And the
race is back under way.

1:36:01.548 --> 1:36:03.132
- All right El, let's do this.

1:36:03.174 --> 1:36:05.134
Now, now, commit El.

1:36:05.176 --> 1:36:07.011
- [Announcer] 32 and
39 side by side to,

1:36:07.053 --> 1:36:09.598
oh there's some contact.

1:36:09.639 --> 1:36:12.183
And Lansing comes out
of it in second place,

1:36:12.225 --> 1:36:14.603
right behind Buck McCreadie.

1:36:16.730 --> 1:36:17.939
- Watch your six, Buck.

1:36:19.773 --> 1:36:21.192
- Come on, Ellie.

1:36:23.111 --> 1:36:24.654
- [Announcer] Lansing
just can't find a way

1:36:24.696 --> 1:36:26.573
to make a run on McCreadie.

1:36:26.615 --> 1:36:29.409
- I'm gonna set him
up to dive in late.

1:36:29.451 --> 1:36:31.244
- Right on the bumper.

1:36:33.747 --> 1:36:34.706
- Buck!

1:36:34.748 --> 1:36:35.915
She's right behind you.

1:36:35.957 --> 1:36:37.250
- The white flag's out, folks.

1:36:37.292 --> 1:36:38.876
Just one lap to go.

1:36:38.918 --> 1:36:40.253
- Here I come.

1:36:40.295 --> 1:36:42.213
- [Tim] Inside, inside.

1:36:44.758 --> 1:36:47.051
- Come on Buck, do not
let that girl pass you.

1:36:47.093 --> 1:36:48.844
What are you doing?

1:36:48.886 --> 1:36:50.305
- [Announcer] Oh, McCreadie
gets loose on the outside.

1:36:50.346 --> 1:36:51.681
It's a clear shot.

1:36:51.723 --> 1:36:52.766
- [Buck] No, no, no, no, no.

1:36:52.806 --> 1:36:53.807
- No, no!

1:36:53.849 --> 1:36:55.226
- Clear El, clear.

1:36:57.103 --> 1:36:58.229
- Come on!

1:37:01.399 --> 1:37:03.735
- [Announcer] And the
winner is the newcomer,

1:37:03.777 --> 1:37:05.027
taking the checkered flag.

1:37:05.069 --> 1:37:07.238
Congratulations on your first

1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:10.283
Protect the Harvest
Nationals win.

1:37:10.325 --> 1:37:15.330
(fireworks popping)
(happy music)

1:37:19.959 --> 1:37:22.253
(cheering)

1:37:51.658 --> 1:37:52.950
- [Vance] Ellie!

1:37:52.992 --> 1:37:53.909
Yeah!

1:37:53.951 --> 1:37:54.910
- [Loretta]
I'm gonna make you

1:37:54.952 --> 1:37:56.579
the biggest cake
you've ever seen.

1:37:56.621 --> 1:37:57.831
- [Merle] Good job, Ellie.

1:37:57.871 --> 1:38:00.082
- One, two, three.

1:38:00.124 --> 1:38:01.209
Cheese.

1:38:01.250 --> 1:38:02.585
