00:18.586 --> 00:19.620
MJosh.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.124
Hey, Colton.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.596
You good?

00:28.662 --> 00:31.732
- Yeah. How are you?
 - Uh, good.

00:31.799 --> 00:35.035
Come on in. Can't believe
 you drove all the way
 out here just to see me.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.338
Can I get you a drink,
 or did you wanna see the--

00:37.405 --> 00:39.840
- Um, I'm okay.
- Sure, sure.

00:39.907 --> 00:42.210
Living room, dining room.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.778
Uh, show you the kitchen
real quick.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.148
Blossie's a great cook.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.749
This is where I do
 most of my cooking.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.384
- In the microwave.

00:50.451 --> 00:53.087
Um, this is where we eat
breakfast every morning.

00:55.789 --> 00:59.327
Was Fussypuss touring?
 Told all my friends
 about them.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.628
- Oh, you did?
 - Yeah.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.397
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.465
- Thanks, man.
 - I'm gonna get
 you some water.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.635
So I have something
 I need to tell you.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.137
Okay.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.838
- Um...

01:10.904 --> 01:13.774
- And I, um...
 - Hey, Josh.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.744
Don't worry about me holding
 a grudge or
 anything like that.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.380
You know,
 I-- I prayed a lot,

01:19.447 --> 01:22.516
and I worked through
 a lot of feelings
 when I got back--

01:22.583 --> 01:26.254
everything that happened,
you know, with me and you

01:26.320 --> 01:29.757
and Rabbi Raquel and--
 and Rita, you know?

01:29.823 --> 01:31.559
Rita died.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.077
- God, this place,
it depresses me.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.246
- It's a good thing
 you're doing.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.080
You have to show up
for people.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.150
Yes, well, I've not always
 done that,

02:30.218 --> 02:33.254
as Bryna will tell you,
 repeatedly.

02:33.321 --> 02:36.190
Well, if you're very good,
 you can buy me a drink later.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.826
Oh, I'll buy you many drinks.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.831
- Come in.

02:46.634 --> 02:47.701
Hi, Bry.

02:56.076 --> 02:59.380
- How is she?
 - They just moved her
 in here this morning.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.915
- She's been sleeping.
 - All right.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.218
- Oh, um--
- Hi, I'm Vicki.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.719
- Hello.
- Hi.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.491
- Hey, Mom, it's Maura.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.893
I'm here with Bryna and Vicki.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.962
Hi, Rose!

03:20.968 --> 03:23.837
Oh! A royal flush!

03:23.904 --> 03:26.774
Jeez, it's about time!

03:26.840 --> 03:29.477
Oh. Hmm.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.679
- That's great.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.946
Yeah.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.233
So this is what it all
 comes down to.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.405
- If we're lucky.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.583
- Um, are either of you hungry?

04:09.650 --> 04:11.585
I've got some leftover
 Chinese at my place.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.654
- I could heat that up.
- Right?

04:13.721 --> 04:15.323
Oh, um, I don't think so.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.757
We were gonna stop
 at the Elephant Cafe.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.060
- You're more
 than welcome to come.
 - No. That's silly.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.661
- Why would you do that?
- Yeah?

04:21.728 --> 04:23.564
Yeah. Waste $50?

04:23.631 --> 04:27.468
Come on. You could help me
 carry these things back.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.936
- Help me over here?
 - Um...

04:29.002 --> 04:30.304
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.872
- Should I help?
- Mm-hmm. Sure.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.374
It's the boxes here.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.207
- Alley-oop. There you go.
 Two!

04:34.274 --> 04:35.876
- Oh, God!

04:37.811 --> 04:40.448
You did that really well.
 My turn. Come on.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.882
All right, here we go.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.051
- Hell, no.
 - It's cute.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.519
Yeah?
 Are you loving my Haggadah?

04:45.586 --> 04:47.988
Mid-City can suck it.

04:48.055 --> 04:51.291
- No, it can't.
 - This Seder is going
 to kick ass.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.961
- I did such a good job.
- I know.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.496
All right.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.064
- Have you fucked him yet?
 - Oh, my.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.432
Come on.

04:58.499 --> 05:01.034
- Come on. Have you?
 - No.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.371
- You like him?
- No, I--

05:03.437 --> 05:05.706
Come on, you cannot tell me
 you don't have something
 going with him.

05:05.773 --> 05:09.410
I see his widow pheromones
 spraying all over you.

05:09.477 --> 05:12.045
- He's way too sweet for me.
 - What?

05:12.112 --> 05:14.948
No, he's like--
 He's a very, very,
 very good person.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.917
It's-- He's too sweet.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.520
Oh, are you afraid
 you can't get a hard-on
 for that sweetness?

05:19.587 --> 05:21.489
Come on, you need
 to bone him, Raquel.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.858
Sarah...

05:24.925 --> 05:26.394
What?

05:32.633 --> 05:35.503
You're in this galaxy
 called Kronos,

05:35.569 --> 05:38.872
and everyone is working
collectively,

05:38.939 --> 05:41.909
and everyone chooses, like,
 a particular, like, avatar,

05:41.975 --> 05:44.712
like, a mythical creature.
 You know, like, I'm a wizard,

05:44.778 --> 05:46.447
and this guy I
 was playing with

05:46.514 --> 05:47.748
the other day,
 he was a dragon.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.650
- But why does he
get to be the dragon?

05:49.717 --> 05:50.551
Oh, I would never
 be the dragon.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.420
- No?
 - No.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.353
- So the
 dragon's uncool?

05:53.421 --> 05:54.922
- No, it's just that

05:54.988 --> 05:57.725
I've always preferred
to be the wizard.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.993
- Yeah, well, of course.
- Cheers.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.929
- Cheers.
 - Cheers.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.164
- I have a question.
 - Yes.

06:04.231 --> 06:08.368
Um, Mom, did she--
 Has she written anything down

06:08.436 --> 06:09.202
- about her wishes
 or anything?

06:09.269 --> 06:10.871
- No.

06:10.938 --> 06:14.107
- We're not getting anything.
 - That's not the question.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.076
- Listen to me.
 - There's no money.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.879
But I thought Grandma Rose was
 giving me
 the stamp collection.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.748
If she said so, she said so.

06:20.814 --> 06:21.749
I'm happy to hear
 the younger generation

06:21.815 --> 06:25.586
is interested in
 "phile-ately."

06:25.653 --> 06:27.354
- It's "phil-at-ely."
 - Philately?

06:27.421 --> 06:28.822
- It's philately.
 - It's not.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.658
- It's philate--
 - It's "phi-lately."

06:30.724 --> 06:32.793
- It is?
 - You don't know what it is.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.095
I do, it's stamps.
 It's about stamps.
 It's collecting--

06:35.162 --> 06:36.897
Oh, my gosh,
 I went to school, you know.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.866
Do you need help with money?

06:38.932 --> 06:41.802
- 'Cause I'm here to help.
 - Where were you 15 years ago?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.737
Wow.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.607
Why don't you get off
 this endless martyr thing?

06:46.674 --> 06:49.543
- Doesn't that get tiring?
 - Yeah. Why don't I become
 more like you?

06:49.610 --> 06:52.846
Send out emails begging
for organic food

06:52.913 --> 06:56.450
- while I'm recovering
from my plastic surgery.
- Scooch in.

06:56.517 --> 07:01.054
- Can I ask you
 a personal question, Vicki?
 - Sure. Yeah.

07:01.121 --> 07:04.291
Did you send out those emails
 when you had your sex change?

07:04.357 --> 07:08.095
- Jesus Christ.
 - What?

07:08.161 --> 07:10.030
I'm not trans.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.299
Oh, my God.
 Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.535
Oh, forgive me.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.471
I thought maybe
 that's what the two
 of you saw in each other.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.673
Well, I feel like a fool.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.610
- Oh, God.

07:24.344 --> 07:27.314
You still laughing
 about the sex change?

07:27.380 --> 07:28.949
No, she thought I was trans.

07:29.016 --> 07:32.119
- Oh.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.922
- Oh, my God.
 - What if you were?

07:39.727 --> 07:42.195
Well, you know, there's
 actually, like, a tree
 in Scotland

07:42.262 --> 07:44.898
that's in the middle
 of changing its sex,

07:44.965 --> 07:46.466
like, right now.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.040
The only operation I've ever
 had was my double mastectomy.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.609
Oh, I'm so sorry.
 I've had a lumpectomy.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.511
Turned out everything
 was benign,

07:57.578 --> 07:58.679
but the waiting was
 a nightmare.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.381
Can't imagine
 what you went through.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.784
Well, I thought
 I might have reconstruction,

08:03.851 --> 08:07.955
but I didn't want
 to go under again.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.190
You hear that?

08:14.728 --> 08:16.530
Dear Jesus, we pray

08:16.597 --> 08:19.967
that Rita's soul
 is with you right now,

08:20.033 --> 08:24.437
and that in between the time
 she jumped and hit the
 shopping mall floor,

08:24.504 --> 08:28.208
she realized her mistake
 and took you into her heart.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.779
- Amen.
- Amen.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.581
She didn't jump.
 It was an accident.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.248
- That's right.
- Uh, Colton...

08:35.315 --> 08:37.851
only God and Rita really
know what happened, son.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.753
But if she jumped,
 then she's not gonna
 get into heaven.

08:39.820 --> 08:43.356
Hey, nobody's saying that
 she did it on purpose, okay?

08:43.423 --> 08:45.458
- Well, uh--
 - Buddy? Hey, hey.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.062
I saw her a couple days
 before the accident.
 Everything was good.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.732
She was juicing.
Her meds were adjusted.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.434
Every morning,
 she told me how happy
 I made her.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.037
That's true. Hey, I know--

08:57.104 --> 08:58.706
I know what you're feeling
 right now, believe me.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.539
- I want her to
 get into heaven.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.874
- You didn't--

09:00.941 --> 09:03.443
- She's going to heaven.
- How do you know?

09:03.510 --> 09:05.445
I just do.

09:05.512 --> 09:08.515
Josh, we're just so happy
 you could be here

09:08.582 --> 09:10.984
- with Colton.
 - It's a lovely thing.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.690
Hey, buddy?

09:16.757 --> 09:20.894
So when I was cleaning
 out her apartment,
 um, I found this.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.296
and I thought, you know,
 you should have something
 of hers.

09:27.735 --> 09:30.570
I didn't know
Rita was a hippie.

09:30.638 --> 09:34.074
I thought Rita was
 a dog walker.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.976
You know,
Colton is preaching now.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.078
Yeah, Rita and I,

09:38.145 --> 09:39.046
- we watched
 the video together.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.180
- You did?

09:40.247 --> 09:42.015
- Mm-hmm.
 - What did she think?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.116
She loved it.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.718
I mean, she said
 it was awesome.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.621
I thought it was awesome.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.890
Well, of course she did--
 of course they did,

09:49.957 --> 09:51.759
'cause Colton's got the gift.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.828
- Just like Gene.
 - Mmm.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.597
You know, Blossie,
 any preacher

09:57.665 --> 10:00.133
is just a vessel for the Lord.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.504
But you know, Josh,
 seeing Colton preach in person

10:04.571 --> 10:06.807
is so much more powerful.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.076
Oh, I'm still learning.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.011
Oh, now, Colton,
 what do we say?

10:11.078 --> 10:12.746
- False modesty--
 - False modesty.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.282
...is ugly to the Lord.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.151
This is a gift he has
 given you, and
 you must own it.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.352
Yes, ma'am.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.330
- It's sort of this,
 uh, it-shaped thing.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.332
It-shaped thing?

10:32.399 --> 10:34.868
"It" is an experience.
 It's being in California.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.603
It's Los Angeles.
 It's the San Fernando Valley.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.839
It's exactly what I expected,
 but it's also different.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.608
- It.

10:41.675 --> 10:46.279
Oh, my God.
 He wants to fuck you.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.484
Oh, my God. Do it.

10:51.551 --> 10:54.321
Do it, do it, do it.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.059
- Is this seat taken?
 - No.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.165
- Hi.
 - Hey.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.204
Soft lips.

11:14.307 --> 11:18.011
Nice. Take your top off.
 Oh, yeah.

11:18.078 --> 11:21.381
He really--
 He wants this.

11:21.448 --> 11:24.117
He'll lose his mind.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.286
Oh, yeah, here we go.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.821
This is gonna be good.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.323
No, this is gonna be
 really good.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.426
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yes.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.329
- Okay.
 - May I touch your nipple?

11:36.396 --> 11:38.799
- Um...
- Yes.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.400
- Okay.
- Yeah?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.736
Sure. Sure.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.342
Oh.

11:51.544 --> 11:55.348
Your areola is a relief map

11:55.415 --> 11:57.384
to every place
 you've ever been,

11:57.450 --> 11:59.652
every feeling
 you've ever felt, and--

11:59.719 --> 12:02.790
- Oh, my God.
 - ...every person
 you've ever loved.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.161
Thank you.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.330
May I kiss your exquisite
 collar bone?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.900
You don't have to ask me.
 You can just do it.

12:12.966 --> 12:16.436
I just got back from
 a birthright trip where
 we always ask permission--

12:16.503 --> 12:18.105
- Just stop talking.
 - Yeah, okay.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.206
- Okay?
 - Yeah. Oh.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.323
I'll be right there!
 Just a second!

12:36.389 --> 12:39.993
- I wanna go home.
- We'll go in a minute.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.229
- I wanna go now.
 - Here it is!

12:42.295 --> 12:44.664
Look at this.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.967
- Wow!
 - And it has a companion.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.336
- Oh, that's so cute.
 - Isn't it great?

12:49.402 --> 12:51.805
- That's great.
 - Let me top you off
 with some wine there.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.606
- Oh, please--

12:53.673 --> 12:54.607
- Anyway--
 - Look, baby.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.109
...I wanted to like it,

12:56.176 --> 12:56.977
- but every time
 I carried it--

12:57.044 --> 12:58.812
- Be nice, okay?

12:58.879 --> 13:01.514
- ...I felt like a--
 - Are you gonna have more
 to drink?

13:01.581 --> 13:03.216
...one of those
 streetwalker people.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.818
Please don't have
 any more to drink.
 I want to go home.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.820
I bet you can.

13:06.887 --> 13:10.690
And don't forget,
there's one in silver, too.

13:10.757 --> 13:13.894
- Yes, there is.
 - Oh, Maura and I will
 just share this one.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.830
It's really beautiful.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.967
Oh, it must be--

13:20.033 --> 13:24.271
Must be nice to have someone
 to share a pocketbook with.

13:24.337 --> 13:27.941
Okay, I wanna go now.
 Enough chit-chat, Vicki.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.643
You know who brought me back
 from the hospital when I had
 my colonoscopy?

13:30.710 --> 13:32.312
- Who?
- And she's off.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.314
- She did?
 - The taxi driver.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.917
What about Simon?
 He didn't help you?

13:36.984 --> 13:39.352
Well, Simon, you know,
he's got some, uh,

13:39.419 --> 13:40.787
you know, phobias.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.655
Oh, gee,
 I wonder how he got those.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.058
- You know--
 - Why don't you
 have another drink?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.327
My neighbor's Pomeranian died

13:47.394 --> 13:49.629
going under,
 getting his teeth cleaned.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.131
If it isn't good for dogs,

13:51.198 --> 13:52.699
I mean, it probably not
good for people. Jeez!

13:52.765 --> 13:54.434
Uh-huh.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.438
Don't you ever worry about him
 getting botched surgery?

13:58.505 --> 14:00.140
Oh, her? Oh, yeah.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.943
- I worry a lot.
- Yeah.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.546
But, you know,
 if I've told her once,

14:06.613 --> 14:10.817
I've told her 10,000 times,
 she's perfect the way she is.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.386
Oh, well, I wouldn't go
that far.

14:16.924 --> 14:19.626
Hey, sweetie, I wanna go.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.228
- I'm not felling well.
- Okay.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.265
You know, I wanted lipo
 for 20 years.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.400
- My God.
 - I didn't die not getting it.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.470
Well, you know, it's not
 exactly the same thing,

14:30.537 --> 14:33.740
but, you know,
 carpe fucking diem, Bry.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.508
Go get your lipo.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.110
It's a little late!

14:37.177 --> 14:39.579
I spent half of my life
 caring for our mother.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.381
Now what have I got left?
 Nothing!

14:41.448 --> 14:45.152
Well, life sucks, honey,
 and then you die, all right?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.053
- Really? doesn't
 suck for you!

14:46.119 --> 14:46.987
- Thank you for a lovely

14:47.054 --> 14:48.588
evening.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.990
- You're getting
 everything you want!
 - Can we go?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.591
- You were not a handsome man.
 - Let's go.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.526
And I don't think you're
 gonna be a very pretty woman,

14:53.593 --> 14:55.562
and I don't think surgery
 can do anything to help that.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.431
Jesus Christ!

14:58.498 --> 15:02.635
I don't wanna be trans,
 I am trans!

15:02.702 --> 15:06.206
The next time I see you,
 you're probably gonna look
 like Michael Jackson...

15:06.273 --> 15:08.341
with half a Brussel's sprout
 for a nose!

15:08.408 --> 15:10.143
- This! This?
 - Yeah?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.012
This is why
 your husband left you

15:12.079 --> 15:13.713
when you were pregnant
 with Simon.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.483
My husband left me
 because he's an asshole!

15:16.549 --> 15:18.518
- Oh, God.
 - I'm sorry, Vicki.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.887
Let's go.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.522
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.291
- I'm sorry you had
 to see that.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.826
- No, no, no, that's okay.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.228
- We just--

15:28.295 --> 15:29.997
We had a bit too much
 to drink, okay?

15:30.063 --> 15:31.198
Yeah.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.548
Can you give me
 the keys, please?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.550
- I'm fine.
 - I know.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.986
You've had a lot to drink,
 so just give me the keys.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.087
Please?

15:55.888 --> 15:57.557
Thank you.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.528
Can you make me--
 Thank you.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.064
Can you make me
 understand something?

16:04.131 --> 16:08.868
You hug her after
 she says those things?

16:08.935 --> 16:11.438
And you side--
 You side with her?

16:11.504 --> 16:15.442
How do you do that?
 You say that I'm fine
 the way I am?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.110
Oh, why?
 Is that a crime?

16:17.177 --> 16:19.579
It's not a crime,
 but that's not me.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.881
That's not who I am.
 That's not my--

16:21.948 --> 16:25.752
Why does it always have to be
 about Maura all of the time?

16:25.818 --> 16:28.088
- I need help--
 - Maura's transition,
 Maura's surgery!

16:28.155 --> 16:29.889
Yes, I'm having surgery
 and I'm scared.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.125
- Have you ever been scared?
 - Maura, Maura, Maura,
 all of the time!

16:32.192 --> 16:34.327
All right, just say
 whatever comes to your head.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.263
- I will. I will.
 - All right, fine.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.131
Let's go. You know,
 I have to tell you something.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.268
You disappoint me.
 You're better than this.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.669
- That's really--
 - You're better than--

16:42.735 --> 16:46.173
And you know what else?
 You're cheap.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.907
And you're a terrible tipper.

16:47.974 --> 16:51.711
Yeah. To waiters and to valets
 and to that poor pizza guy.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.547
- You gave him nothing!
- It took 45 minutes

16:54.614 --> 16:56.149
for that pizza to show up!

16:56.216 --> 16:58.085
- So what?
- And I always--

16:58.151 --> 17:00.220
I always tip 15%.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.056
15% is what you give
 for bad service.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.692
15% is when they spit
 in your food.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.395
15% is when they stab you.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.832
You know what?
 I'm tired of
 fighting with you.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.135
- Fine. I'm going.
 - We have different
 world views.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.836
- Okay?
- Yeah.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.938
- Yeah. Who knew?
 - I knew. I knew the moment--

17:19.005 --> 17:21.708
I knew the moment
 you gave that valet a dollar.

17:42.095 --> 17:46.065
Can't sleep without the fan on
 ever since I was little.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.070
Even have a name for it.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.672
I call it Fan-Fan.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.146
- Fan-Fan?
 - Yeah.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.485
Yeah.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.323
Hey, if you're uncomfortable,
 let me know.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.125
I can take the air mattress.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.463
- You stay in your own bed.
 - All right.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.579
Hey, I'm sorry.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.252
You don't have to be sorry.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.592
I love you.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.596
I know.

19:22.094 --> 19:25.131
Antlers?
 That's interesting.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.666
Hey.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.203
- I hate you.
 - Why?

19:30.270 --> 19:32.339
Because you got inside
 of my head.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.875
I was feeling
 all of your pressure.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.744
And I knew you were gonna
 ask me about it so I--

19:37.810 --> 19:39.312
We did it. We did it.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.647
Stop it.
 I feel like I'm 12 years old.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.516
Stop it. Stop it.
 It was--

19:43.583 --> 19:45.685
- Yes, yes!
 - ...not good.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.454
Oh, my God.
 No, I'm super happy.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.256
- That's so cool.
 - Are you even
 listening to me?

19:49.322 --> 19:51.691
Oh, my God. I can't believe
 I told you this.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.060
I was reading up on cults,
 and you know the only thing

19:54.126 --> 19:55.962
more powerful than
 a charismatic cult leader

19:56.028 --> 19:58.565
is a charismatic cult couple.

19:58.631 --> 20:02.335
This is not a cult, Sarah.
 We're just doing a Seder.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.704
- And we're not a couple.
 - Well, okay, but, you know,

20:04.771 --> 20:06.406
you don't have to slam cults,
 cults do good things.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.442
Cults, like,
 create vegetarians and stuff.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.679
Anyway, we've sold,
 like, 68 tickets.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.982
I mean,
 this thing is happening.

20:16.048 --> 20:20.353
Honestly, I feel like Len
and I are, like, also
connecting around this.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.855
I feel, like,
a little bit of a spark.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.558
- A spark?
 - You know, like,
 when we get together,

20:25.625 --> 20:28.395
around all this Jewy stuff,
like, there's this sexy

20:28.461 --> 20:31.030
but, like, wholesome vibe
 going on.

20:31.097 --> 20:34.166
- So are you gonna get
back together with Len?
- Maybe.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.403
'Cause I thought you said
 that you were bi or gay
 or a lesbian.

20:36.469 --> 20:37.904
That doesn't matter.
 Doesn't mean I don't love him.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.206
- Oh, doesn't matter?
- I wouldn't marry him.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.108
- You could marry him again?
 - Maybe, maybe.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.811
I don't know, maybe.
 I just, like, feel just,

20:44.877 --> 20:47.046
like, very inspired
 by all this spirituality.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.848
It's not spirituality!

20:54.321 --> 20:55.522
Hey, Raquel, do you need
a glass of water?

20:55.588 --> 20:58.558
No water!

20:58.625 --> 20:59.592
Sorry.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.193
I just want-- I'm--

21:01.260 --> 21:03.430
Can you clarify
 for me really fast

21:03.496 --> 21:05.898
what spirituality is
 for you, Sarah?

21:05.965 --> 21:07.867
I-- I don't know.
 I didn't--

21:07.934 --> 21:09.769
I mean, I don't--
 That's-- I don't know.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.638
'Cause I can tell you
 what it's not.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.474
It's not changing your mind
 whenever you feel like it.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.175
It's not following your bliss.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.311
It's not finding yourself

21:18.378 --> 21:20.046
by crawling through
 your belly button

21:20.112 --> 21:22.014
and out your own asshole
 and calling it a journey.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.350
Fine!

21:26.052 --> 21:28.254
I mean, it's easy to say
 what it's not.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.789
What is it?

21:29.856 --> 21:32.124
- Uh, for, me,

21:32.191 --> 21:34.126
God is ever-changing.

21:34.193 --> 21:36.028
That's what we're trying
 to do here

21:36.095 --> 21:38.097
is take something that
can't be expressed in words

21:38.164 --> 21:40.533
and give it ritual
and community

21:40.600 --> 21:42.268
and a place
where we can all--

21:42.335 --> 21:45.171
- Don't fuckin' speak
 for me, Duvid.
 - Okay.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.707
I'm sorry, Raquel,
 but you've been swearing

21:47.774 --> 21:49.476
a lot more than you did
in seminary.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.612
Fuck you, Duvid!
Fuck you!

21:52.679 --> 21:54.947
I'm not-- You know, I'm not
 fucking doing the Seder!

21:55.014 --> 21:56.749
I'm not doing the Seder!
 I'm out!

21:56.816 --> 21:59.251
Okay! Calm down. We've got
a lot of people coming.
Raquel?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.120
You know what?
 I don't give a
 shit if the Pope,

22:01.187 --> 22:02.989
if fuckin' Donald Trump,

22:03.055 --> 22:06.092
if Moshiach himself shows up
 to this fucking thing!

22:06.158 --> 22:08.194
- I'm not doing it!
 - Who's Moshiach?

22:08.260 --> 22:10.129
- The messiah.
 - He's the messiah, Sarah!

22:10.196 --> 22:13.800
That is the fucking messiah!

22:13.866 --> 22:16.068
I'm not doing your shitty
 fuckin' Seder. I'm out.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.605
I'm not doing this.
 I'm not putting my name
 on this shit.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.907
I am not doing it.
 I'm not doing it.
 I'm not doing it.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.876
I'm not doing it.
 I'm not doing it.
 I'm not doing it.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.645
- I'm not doing it!
 - Okay.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.347
- All right, all right.
- I'm not doing it!

22:28.415 --> 22:30.783
- Okay, okay.

22:36.689 --> 22:41.794
* Jesus told me that I'd have
 to live humble and change
 my name *

22:41.861 --> 22:44.163
* Change my name

22:44.230 --> 22:49.669
* Jesus told me that I'd have
 to live humble and change
 my name *

22:49.736 --> 22:51.804
* Change my name

22:51.871 --> 22:55.708
* Oh, I told Jesus
 it'll be all right *

22:55.775 --> 22:59.045
* Be all right, be all right

22:59.111 --> 23:02.348
* I told Jesus
 it will be all right *

23:02.415 --> 23:06.586
- * Change my name
 - * Change my name

23:14.026 --> 23:14.994
Thank you.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.931
Jesus watches over us.

23:18.998 --> 23:22.368
His Holy Father created
 the heavens and the earth

23:22.435 --> 23:25.004
and all of mankind
 in His own image.

23:25.071 --> 23:28.107
And that's why
 He cares about us...

23:28.174 --> 23:31.010
even when we've lost our way.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.679
- Praise Him.
 - Praise the Lord.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.682
And the way we find
 our way back to Him,

23:35.748 --> 23:38.350
no matter how far
 we've strayed,

23:38.417 --> 23:41.888
is to come to the Lord
 in prayer.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.523
Let us pray.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.825
Heavenly Father,

23:45.892 --> 23:49.361
we ask You to lift up
 all of God's children

23:49.428 --> 23:51.464
and guide us in Your ways.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.900
We ask You to remember
 our loved ones

23:53.966 --> 23:55.835
who are no longer with us.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.671
And we ask You to hold up
 my birth mother, Rita,

23:58.738 --> 24:02.174
who died unexpectedly.

24:02.241 --> 24:06.278
She knew how much it meant
 to me when I accepted You
 into my heart.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.183
In Jesus' name we pray.

24:11.250 --> 24:14.887
- Amen.
- Amen.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.491
Now, Lord, we pray that Rita's
 death will not be in vain.

24:20.192 --> 24:24.597
Because we all know how short
 our time here on earth is.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.533
You could call us home
 at any time.

24:29.335 --> 24:32.872
I wanna take this moment
right now

24:32.939 --> 24:35.241
to ask if there's anyone
out here today

24:35.307 --> 24:36.676
who might not be saved yet--

24:39.145 --> 24:42.348
...but wants to know Jesus
 as their personal Lord
 and savior--

24:42.414 --> 24:44.551
- Mm-hmm.
- Praise Jesus!

24:44.617 --> 24:47.186
...to come on
 up to this altar.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.756
Would anyone here like
 to renounce Satan

24:49.822 --> 24:52.692
and accept Jesus
 into their heart?

24:52.759 --> 24:54.226
- Praise Him!
 - Yes!

24:54.293 --> 24:58.064
Who wants to have their
burdens lifted from them?

24:58.130 --> 24:59.632
Who wants to be free?

24:59.699 --> 25:02.602
- Yes.
- Jesus, Colton.

25:02.669 --> 25:08.174
Who here wants to accept Jesus
 into his heart?

25:27.026 --> 25:28.995
Come on up.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.570
Josh Pfefferman,
 do you want ever-lasting life?

25:37.637 --> 25:39.238
Mm-hmm.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.973
Do you renounce Satan?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.508
Sure.

25:42.575 --> 25:46.478
And do you accept Jesus Christ

25:46.545 --> 25:48.615
as your Lord and savior?

25:51.584 --> 25:53.085
Okay.

26:03.129 --> 26:07.734
* Open up the doors of heaven
 and let me in *

26:09.501 --> 26:12.104
* I think I'm finally tired
 of living *

26:12.171 --> 26:13.740
* Let me in

26:15.374 --> 26:18.144
.. * I'm gonna walk
 in the glory *

26:18.210 --> 26:21.080
.. * And tell everyone
 my story *

26:21.147 --> 26:25.051
* Open up the doors of heaven
 and let me in *

26:26.853 --> 26:30.790
* I try to live my life
 in a righteous way *

26:32.424 --> 26:38.264
* I try to do my best
 from day to day *

26:38.330 --> 26:40.967
* But no matter
 how hard I try *

26:41.033 --> 26:43.703
* It seems all I do is cry

26:43.770 --> 26:49.341
* So open up the doors
 of heaven and let me in *

26:49.408 --> 26:53.813
* Someone told me there's
 a better place than this *

26:54.305 --> 27:00.421
