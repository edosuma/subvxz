WEBVTT

00:05.422 --> 00:06.339
Previously, on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:07.215 --> 00:08.299
[bleep] you, I'm going home.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.385
I quit.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.720
The chef left?

00:11.761 --> 00:13.555
I need to be able
to trust my crew.

00:13.596 --> 00:14.806
I needed to come back.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.391
I got a chef.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.394
I'm gonna shave soon
and get out.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.521
-Understood.
-But he isn't out of quarantine.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.398
-We start charter Monday.
-Right.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.524
So, if you can just
get me through this...

00:24.566 --> 00:25.692
Understood, yeah.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.193
Even though it's my last trip,

00:27.235 --> 00:29.195
I still just wanna
do the best I can.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.322
Dave, you got
a soft spot for anyone?

00:31.364 --> 00:33.366
-Heh.
-Yeah?

00:33.408 --> 00:34.826
Ooh, who, who?

00:34.868 --> 00:36.745
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.205
It's definitely a new dynamic,
being attracted to my boss.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.510
Okay, I take that back.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.180
You're a ----ing bosun,
stand the [bleep] down!

00:55.221 --> 00:57.390
-I will [bleep] you up.
-Go to bed.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.684
You're supposed to be
a ----ing chief stew.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.812
Am I?

01:02.854 --> 01:04.773
Invest in her, and if
it doesn't work for you,

01:04.814 --> 01:07.400
I promise you,
I will let her go.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.694
I need to be responsible
for my team, and unfortunately,

01:09.736 --> 01:12.155
sometimes it's doing things
you don't wanna ----ing do.

01:12.197 --> 01:15.367
In terms of, like,
ethics and morals,

01:15.408 --> 01:17.243
you've really pushed
my boundaries in that.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.870
I apologize for that.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.206
You can go into Malia's cabin,
and I'll share with her.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.624
Someone's gotta do it, right?

01:22.665 --> 01:25.502
Athena Lucene is a success
coach from Connecticut.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.421
So, Athena organized an
entrepreneur's retreat.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.340
Have I taken care of you guys?

01:30.382 --> 01:31.800
Happy?
Okay, good.

01:34.886 --> 01:35.929
Lexi's on point.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.597
We're getting the job done

01:37.639 --> 01:38.723
and, like, that's all
I'm trying to do.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.141
Start bringing the food out.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.309
Yeah, sure.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.771
Yes.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.773
Can we start bringing
out the dinner?

01:46.815 --> 01:48.650
I'm ready to eat.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.610
Let me check, because I don't
think the food is ready yet.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.278
Hello?

02:11.006 --> 02:12.465
I'm ready to eat.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.675
When I don't eat,
I lose my hunger.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.552
Then later, I can't eat.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.804
All right, let me check, because
I don't think the food is ready.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.223
Man.
I'm ready to grub.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.891
-For real, bro.
-No one's got drinks.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.643
Now she's probably like,
"Where is everyone?"

02:23.685 --> 02:24.686
Hello?

02:26.438 --> 02:28.314
But the chef is just
plating it now.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.649
I'll be with you in a moment.

02:29.691 --> 02:30.692
Okay.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.320
I'm trying to manage the boat

02:34.362 --> 02:35.613
and I'm trying to look
after the guests,

02:35.655 --> 02:37.490
but I need all your guests
to be there

02:37.532 --> 02:38.742
and not make it look
like I'm not doing my job,

02:38.783 --> 02:40.618
because that's not
the case at all.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.747
It's just, like, oh, why can't
things just go smoothly.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.206
Apologies.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.337
So, for your first
course tonight we have

02:50.378 --> 02:52.422
polenta topped with
crispy calamari.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.758
This feels a little awkward,
sitting like this.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.551
You don't want to sit like that?

02:56.593 --> 02:58.345
I prefer to sit over here.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.512
We can move you,
if you feel more comfortable.

02:59.554 --> 03:00.722
We can move you.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.682
Yeah, this just feels
awkward, sorry.

03:02.724 --> 03:03.767
No, that's fine.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.606
Thank you,
I would prefer this.

03:09.647 --> 03:10.732
-Of course.
-Yes, thank you.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.485
This is good.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.486
I think it's good, yeah.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.029
It's good, right?

03:16.071 --> 03:18.865
Okay, so you're going to be
on anchor watch tonight.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.867
-Please do deck checks.
-Yeah.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.746
How's the calamari?

03:24.788 --> 03:25.747
All gone.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.290
Jesus Christ.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.708
I'm so hungry.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.960
Well, he's got your
next one ready, so.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.253
Good, we're ready.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.588
One bite, he took.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.882
Does anybody else want
a salad, if I ask?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.467
I'll take one.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.927
I would give them as much
food as possible,

03:38.968 --> 03:40.720
because they're clearing
their plates quickly.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.055
Oh, boy.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.265
Athena and her group,
it's probably

03:44.307 --> 03:45.558
the worst-case scenario
I can think of

03:45.600 --> 03:47.394
for my last guests
on this boat.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.562
But challenge accepted.

03:49.604 --> 03:50.814
I saw people taking
a picture of the food.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.691
Okay, good.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.859
Katie, Katie, looks
like they're ready to clear.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.363
-Copy.
-Mzi, Mzi, Malia.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.407
Can you wrap up on deck
and come inside

04:00.448 --> 04:01.741
and give us a hand
with these dishes?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.284
Copy that.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.538
We're about to
go plate next course.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.914
-Katie.
-Yes?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.499
I want a salad.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.709
Instead of...
because they're...

04:10.750 --> 04:11.918
Not instead of anything.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.919
No, not instead of,
not instead of.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.462
-In addition to.
-Okay.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.672
Ugh.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.340
Galley.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.967
They just want a salad
with their main, as well.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.677
-All right, thanks, bye.
-Bye.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.763
Dinner is so much about timing,

04:23.805 --> 04:26.599
but I'm not in the position
to be complaining right now.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.685
All right, let's do this.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.311
-Did you have a good day?
-Yeah.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.313
You guys are killing it,
which makes my life easy.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.484
Dropped the anchor,
which is very satisfying.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.083
What else do you wanna learn,

04:52.125 --> 04:54.002
how to do long-stage,
short--

04:54.044 --> 04:55.337
Yeah.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.675
So, traditional
Croatian lamb pica.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.802
Yo, and if they don't like
this, I got a backup ready.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.513
And I'm gonna do
the salad right now, okay?

05:12.187 --> 05:14.105
So, for your
main course tonight,

05:14.147 --> 05:16.399
you have a Croatian lamb pica.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.734
Let me see.

05:21.780 --> 05:22.739
Ooh.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.491
Mm, it's tender.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.993
Thank you so much.
This is balsamic vinaigrette.

05:27.035 --> 05:27.994
Balsamic vinaigrette.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.662
Wow.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.123
Katie, feel free to bring out
the salad right now.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.709
-Yeah, it's just behind me.
-Okay, perfect, thank you.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.550
Excuse me, Lexi,
do you have something

05:42.592 --> 05:43.760
to clean this table right here?

05:43.802 --> 05:44.844
Yeah, so as soon as we clear,

05:44.886 --> 05:46.012
we're gonna come around and

05:46.054 --> 05:47.764
just wipe it all off
at one time.

05:49.724 --> 05:50.850
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll come around and wipe it.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.852
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.479
I'm feeling a bit frustrated.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.106
I feel like Lexi
being back on service

05:56.147 --> 05:57.816
for this trip is not fair.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.193
Just because you caused drama
and nearly got fired

06:00.235 --> 06:02.737
doesn't mean now that you should
kind of have special treatment.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.197
That is just, like,
bullsh--.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.074
<i>Katie, Katie,</i>
<i>that's all cabins done.</i>

06:06.116 --> 06:10.537
I'm just trying to get started
on all these towels in laundry.

06:10.578 --> 06:11.955
I'll let Mat know.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.207
Oof, it is raining.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.543
<i>-Malia, Malia, Mzi.</i>
-Mzi, go ahead.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.716
Yes, sir,
I'll come give you a hand.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.889
<i>Lloyd, just stay on the bridge.</i>

06:29.931 --> 06:31.683
Where is Lloyd?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.018
They're requesting to see you.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.898
I don't...
I don't know.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.692
The wind's picking up,

06:40.734 --> 06:43.611
and when the wind blows,
you don't leave the bridge.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.785
I wasn't proud of my
performance.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.121
And I'm nervous
they're gonna hate everything.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.748
Hi, everyone.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.082
Ooh!

06:56.124 --> 06:57.917
Chocolate cups with
chocolate mousse.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.003
Did they tell you that we've
been wanting to talk to you?

07:00.045 --> 07:01.755
They did, yeah.

07:03.256 --> 07:08.094
It's been an interesting
evening, huh?

07:08.136 --> 07:11.264
Coming up...

07:11.306 --> 07:12.682
Don't do it.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.726
Oh, he is dreaming.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.986
Did they tell you that we've
been wanting to talk to you?

07:25.028 --> 07:26.654
They did, yeah.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.240
It's been an
interesting evening, huh?

07:29.282 --> 07:34.996
Usually the courses continue
to go in a progressive flow,

07:35.038 --> 07:36.998
but it worked out geniusly.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.166
Oh, good, good.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.167
You handled the pressure
very well.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.835
Thank you very much, I tried to.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.545
-Thank you.
-That's what I'm here for.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.838
So, I'll be there
whenever you need anything.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.590
-Thank you.
-Have a great evening.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.800
Thanks, and same to you.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.682
When the wind gusts, make sure
you don't leave the bridge.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.309
-Sorry, yes.
-It's not a good thing, at all.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.727
Yeah, sorry.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.104
I'm gonna go to bed.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.897
I trust you, Lloyd.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.857
Yeah. I'll be... I'll stay
in here the whole time.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.693
Thanks, good night.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.944
Oh, hey there.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.278
Whew, what a day.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.863
How did we love dessert?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.156
It was so yummy.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.616
-It was delicious.
-How long have you got?

08:11.658 --> 08:13.702
Two seconds.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.120
-Are you not in a good mood?
-[bleep] no.

08:15.161 --> 08:15.954
Why not?

08:19.082 --> 08:20.625
So, Court's gonna move
into your cabin,

08:20.667 --> 08:22.669
because someone's
gotta do it, right?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.046
-Hi, roomie!
-Hi!

08:25.088 --> 08:26.589
What happened?

08:26.631 --> 08:28.133
It's just a known
thing that if Lexi

08:28.174 --> 08:29.342
was staying with her, and
they would share a cabin.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.719
Really?

08:30.760 --> 08:31.845
So, it was really, like,
the two of them

08:31.886 --> 08:32.887
who freaked out on each other?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.222
It started with them two,

08:34.264 --> 08:38.351
and then it went on,
and I was just drunk.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.270
-All right, bye.
-Bye.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.275
-Have a great night.
-Thank you.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.609
Oh, my God,
look at this laundry.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.736
All the cabins are done.

08:47.777 --> 08:48.903
You're amazing.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.072
-Do you wanna knock off?
-Will do.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.782
Can I just pat that dry?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.244
You're the guests, we have
to make sure you're happy.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.620
Any more shots?

08:57.662 --> 08:59.414
-One more shot.
-Oh, you want one more?

08:59.456 --> 09:00.915
-Yeah, yeah.
-Lexi's the best.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.959
I think Lexi really
likes being on service.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.253
She's doing the job,
the guests are loving her.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.298
So, I don't think it's fair
to take that away from Lexi

09:08.340 --> 09:10.008
just because she caused drama.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.221
-Where y'all live in Miami?
-Midtown.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.140
Midtown?
Y'all haven't seen me?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.774
I actually prefer
interacting with the guests,

09:25.815 --> 09:27.275
because you're away
from the crew.

09:27.317 --> 09:30.070
We've all been, like,
avoiding each other.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.281
The atmosphere is still,
like, thick.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.950
How do you know Athena?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.869
-We met them...
-Athena's like our coach.

09:37.911 --> 09:41.122
-And Jeanne is her...
-Jeanne is Anita's assistant.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.707
Assistant, okay.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.250
And Anita's, like,
our business manager.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.795
Oh, okay.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.880
Because we can feel the vibe,
it's real.

09:48.922 --> 09:49.964
Yeah.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.966
Whew, what a day.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.302
Oh, it's been a hectic day.

09:54.344 --> 09:58.098
We have these bizarre
guests on board.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.727
-To us.
-Cheers.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.187
Jesus Christ.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.735
Whoa!

10:10.777 --> 10:13.822
-Oh!
-Ow!

10:13.863 --> 10:15.323
What was that?

10:15.365 --> 10:17.409
-Good night.
-All right, good night.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.794
Oh, my God.

10:52.902 --> 10:53.903
Good morning.

10:53.945 --> 10:54.904
Hello.

10:54.946 --> 10:55.989
How'd it go?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.493
A lot of girls
can relate to this.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.954
There's that awkward line
where you wanna let him down

11:02.996 --> 11:04.873
in which not a bitch,

11:04.914 --> 11:07.250
but you're also stern enough
so he doesn't do it again.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.964
I don't think that
it's gonna happen again.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.384
I think he gets it...
I hope.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.345
Right?

11:18.386 --> 11:20.930
Let's see what
these people want today.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.561
Okay.

11:26.603 --> 11:27.979
It's so beautiful here.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.189
Yeah, very nice.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.528
-Have you?
-No.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.988
What do you reckon
you're gonna do, then?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.323
Do you think
you'll go back home?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.324
Yeah, [bleep].

11:39.366 --> 11:40.992
Well, Mat knows.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.786
I wonder what dramatics
will happen tomorrow night?

11:45.580 --> 11:46.790
Oh, man.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.375
Okay, sweet.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.918
Coming out, stage one.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.211
Out, counter-clockwise.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.587
Counter-clockwise.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.797
I'm not sleeping well, hey?

11:55.298 --> 11:56.466
Lexi's got all this
sh-- that's lighting up

11:56.508 --> 11:58.593
in our cabin...
her charger and sh--.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.012
-Stage two.
-Stage two.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.473
Would you guys like any eggs
to order or anything like that?

12:03.515 --> 12:05.266
I could have a small omelette.

12:05.308 --> 12:06.434
I'll do the
small omelette as well.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.852
Sure.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.354
Scrambled eggs,
waffles, and bacon.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.106
Okay.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.816
What I learned last night
is we're not gonna be

12:12.857 --> 12:14.275
doing a proper service
with these guys.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.528
Like, when they wanna eat,
they wanna eat ASAP.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.947
Omelette, scrambled eggs
with bacon and waffles.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.240
Which way?

12:20.281 --> 12:21.408
Dude, you do this
with me every time.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.451
That's beautiful.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.955
Ooh, the omelette Gods
answered all my prayers.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.960
Hello?

12:32.002 --> 12:33.128
Yeah, it's not bad.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.129
Hello?

12:34.170 --> 12:35.422
Mm.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.549
So, I wanted to touch base
about the cakes.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.259
-Two cakes.
-We have two cakes.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.969
On night two, the group
would like two cakes.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.470
Two cakes, all right.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.140
One cake should say
"Happy Birthday FX Capital"

12:45.181 --> 12:47.058
with their logo on the cake.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.353
We have balloons, because
we're doing a dinner party.

12:50.395 --> 12:53.606
And then the second cake
should be Project Millionaire.

12:53.648 --> 12:54.983
I wanna make sure
everything is good...

12:55.025 --> 12:56.317
Yeah.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.527
So my clients are happy
later on tonight.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.903
-Yeah.
-So, I think that's it.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.490
All right, great.

13:02.532 --> 13:03.616
-Good morning.
-Hi, good morning.

13:03.658 --> 13:04.617
You look so beautiful.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.161
Oh, thank you.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.038
I just... I really just
wanna ride the jet ski.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.999
You know what's going on, man.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.083
Are you ready?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.002
We're like a diner, 24-hour.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.880
All right, enjoy.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.340
Woo!

13:19.382 --> 13:20.592
Here you go.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.635
Oh, I love the display,
thank you.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.557
Do you have any nicknames?

13:31.061 --> 13:32.354
[laughing]

13:32.395 --> 13:33.521
All right.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.482
-Hey, Coco.
-Yes?

13:35.523 --> 13:36.983
Guess who needs your help?

13:37.025 --> 13:38.360
I heard you have really
good handwriting.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.195
Yeah.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.446
You're gonna help me
with the cakes tonight.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.281
They want a logo,
a company logo.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.575
Oh [bleep] gonna be sh--.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.955
Oh, I love when
it's this sort of shimmery.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.374
Especially seeing as
it was, like,

13:52.415 --> 13:54.042
27-odd knots last
night on my watch.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.961
If the wind picks up like that,
just sit in the bridge.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.546
Yeah, that's fine.

13:58.588 --> 14:02.425
Malia has been a breath of fresh
air from my last boss, yeah.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.511
Not... not nice, this...

14:04.552 --> 14:06.137
I... I don't wanna
talk about him.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.222
And I've got a brilliant
word of the day today.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.682
What is it?

14:08.723 --> 14:11.226
"Scintilla," a small amount
or a spark of something.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.477
Oh, I like that.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.522
Not to be confused
with "chinchilla."

14:15.563 --> 14:17.482
Mat, is the cake ready
for me to write on it?

14:17.524 --> 14:18.692
Oh, yeah.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.193
Whoa!

14:20.235 --> 14:23.405
The adventures of
cake girl and cake boy.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.447
-Okay.
-Thank you.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.324
Careful, Mzi, you'll float away.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.743
So, you want the smaller cake
to say "Much Success to PMG,"

14:28.785 --> 14:31.287
and this one to say "Happy
Birthday FX Capital Online?"

14:31.329 --> 14:32.580
Yeah.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.085
Sh--, I'm scared, bro.

14:41.006 --> 14:44.092
Malia, Malia, so we're going
to go back to the dock.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.552
Copy.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.095
Sorry, I'm trying not to
ruin your cake, but...

14:47.137 --> 14:49.305
Ah, [bleep]
this looks so sh--.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.266
It looks like someone's
just ----ing made it

14:51.307 --> 14:54.352
for an
eight-year-old birthday.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.562
We can't serve this, can we?

14:55.603 --> 14:58.148
She's not gonna be impressed.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.066
[bleep]

15:00.108 --> 15:01.109
Coming up...

15:01.151 --> 15:02.736
Mat, come to the bridge, please.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.279
I am on my way.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.532
Oh, no.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.123
We can't serve this, can we?

15:16.374 --> 15:17.667
She's not gonna be impressed.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.044
Should we scrape it off?

15:19.085 --> 15:20.086
Do you think that
would be better?

15:20.128 --> 15:21.838
Well, this looks ----ing sh--,

15:21.880 --> 15:23.506
and I'm not saying I did it,
so I'm gonna scrape it off.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.091
Do you agree on this situation?

15:25.133 --> 15:26.509
I'm...

15:26.551 --> 15:27.761
I have too much to do
to really care anymore.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.512
I'm scraping.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.639
Oh, hey, it'll just go green,

15:31.681 --> 15:33.058
which might be
good for the logo.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.351
Okay.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.644
How am I supposed
to get it all right

15:36.686 --> 15:38.688
with this many different,
unrealistic requests.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.315
And I've gotta do crew dinner,

15:40.357 --> 15:42.650
and I haven't even
started guest dinner.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.611
It's a lot of build-up
in pressure, once again.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.238
I just hope she doesn't come
down and ask to look at them.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.157
Looks like
a kid's Halloween cake.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.369
It's gonna be the best
fourth birthday party ever.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.828
[knocking]

15:53.870 --> 15:56.206
So, we are gonna haul anchor
now and head back,

15:56.247 --> 15:59.084
because of the weather.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.293
It won't be fun for you
on anchor.

16:00.335 --> 16:01.461
-All right.
-Thank you so much.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.380
-No problem.
-Thanks, Captain.

16:03.421 --> 16:06.633
Okay, I have an idea.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.552
I'm gonna print out a thing.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.763
Bridge, bridge, we are standing
by, ready to haul anchor.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.264
Whose birthday?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.849
It's their company.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.226
Oh, yeah, their business,
right, yeah.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.560
Okay, you can haul it.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.190
Do you want someone to
drive it out or something?

16:23.858 --> 16:25.694
David, David, Malia.

16:25.735 --> 16:29.155
If you want, you can go to
the bridge with Captain Sandy.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.865
Yeah, copy,
heading up there now.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.661
Ooh, drive time.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.788
Yeah, I'm gonna change clothes
and freshen up, and...

16:36.830 --> 16:38.748
No worries.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.125
Be my guest.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.376
Thank you very much.

16:41.418 --> 16:42.502
You're welcome.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.587
So, you have your thruster here.

16:44.629 --> 16:45.755
Yeah.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.132
Just one click.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.216
Woo!

16:48.258 --> 16:49.884
Malia's a great leader.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.804
She delegates,
she offers up opportunity.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.264
Obviously, she's attractive.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.433
Well done, sir.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.767
What attracts me
to Malia the most

16:57.809 --> 17:00.437
is probably her strength
and work ethic.

17:00.478 --> 17:01.438
Nice one.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.189
I respect that quite a lot.

17:03.231 --> 17:06.484
Dave, let me know when you
retire your four stripes.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.194
Yeah.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.612
Whatever, it is what it is.

17:09.654 --> 17:12.323
Oh, hell to the mother----ing
yeah.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.451
Coco, man,
perfection's your charm.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.577
Okay, where's the next cake?

17:18.329 --> 17:21.332
So, whenever you guys want, you
can start setting up your lines.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.759
I actually wanna do
a Great Gatsby party,

17:30.800 --> 17:32.302
and I want Leo to be there.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.803
He's, I've met him, hey?

17:33.845 --> 17:35.597
Really?
Where'd you meet him?

17:35.638 --> 17:38.391
First boat I ever worked on,
at the Cannes Film Festival.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.226
I feel like right
now I just need to get

17:40.268 --> 17:41.811
our bond back together.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.730
At least I now know how
to get Lexi's attention.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.774
They said he likes
to party there.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.275
Oh, he does.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.651
And he has lots
of models and girls...

17:48.693 --> 17:50.320
Oh, yes, he does.

17:50.362 --> 17:51.821
I heard about him from one
of my friends who did,

17:51.863 --> 17:53.239
like, Med boats.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.786
I am ----ing green
at this point,

17:57.827 --> 18:00.538
and the chief stew goes up to me
and was like, "I want you to

18:00.580 --> 18:03.333
make sure that Leo has a
drink in his hand all night."

18:03.375 --> 18:05.752
I'm like, why the [bleep]
is she trusting me?

18:09.881 --> 18:12.425
But that's okay,
he's still Leonardo DiCaprio.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.761
It's like he is a wild one.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.805
-Yeah, he is outrageous.
-Wild one.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.852
-Just be careful at night.
-Yeah.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.854
Holy sh--, it's so dark.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.523
Fenders over, guys.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.525
There are difficulties
when it comes to night,

18:28.566 --> 18:30.860
because visibility's not good,

18:30.902 --> 18:33.530
so if we do need to move,
it can be tough.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.699
You're also worried about
crewmember safety.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.659
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.245
-No, Mzi!
-Oh, my...

18:40.286 --> 18:41.830
-You okay?
-Yeah.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.748
Hopefully we can pull it off.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.668
There's two dolphins off
your stern about 40 feet.

18:46.710 --> 18:50.005
We have to come
in-between those two.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.506
Oh... are you good?

18:51.548 --> 18:52.716
-Yes.
-Can we get these lines across?

18:52.757 --> 18:53.883
Yes.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.593
I like to throw
it from the side.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.349
Taking up tension on
the port bow line now.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.852
Try and get this first bit
as close to that as you can.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.729
Bow line is tight.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.314
The stern is secure, we are
clear to shut the mains down.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.691
<i>Nice work, everyone.</i>

19:12.110 --> 19:13.570
Why don't we get
the four trays...

19:13.611 --> 19:15.071
Mm-hmm.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.407
...and just tie each color,
and just pop them there.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.575
Yeah, I'll just do that.

19:18.616 --> 19:19.951
Ready?

19:19.993 --> 19:21.870
Can't be late to your own party.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.747
Oh, you guys dressed up?

19:23.788 --> 19:26.708
It's gonna look
great with sparklers.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.044
Would you prefer this in
a circle or, like, jaggedy?

19:29.085 --> 19:30.503
Yeah, let's do jaggedy.

19:30.545 --> 19:31.963
Smashed it.
Champion.

19:34.466 --> 19:35.467
-Hi.
-Hi, how are you?

19:35.508 --> 19:36.926
Hi.

19:36.968 --> 19:37.927
So you know, I came for
a sneak peek of the cake.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.596
The cakes...

19:39.637 --> 19:41.598
so, I have one here,
and then we made the signs

19:41.639 --> 19:43.600
that say it, we didn't write it.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.894
You made the signs that say it.

19:45.935 --> 19:46.936
Yes.

19:49.814 --> 19:50.774
Oh, boy.

19:50.815 --> 19:51.983
That is chocolate ganache.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.526
Mm.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.446
And the other ones vanilla,
for FX Capital.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.326
Uh...

20:12.212 --> 20:12.712
I'm disappointed.

20:14.547 --> 20:18.093
I had in mind cake,
like two-tier, three-tier.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.679
My apologies.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.683
I'm just being honest.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.602
Sorry about that.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.522
Athena's disappointed before
she even sits down at the table.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.399
I'll be right down here.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.525
That sucks.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.026
What'd she say?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.529
I got an A for effort.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.864
I told you she expected
extravagant...

20:39.906 --> 20:41.074
It is what it is.

20:43.702 --> 20:45.161
It looks super nice.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.163
You put on
a great setup, Lex.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.542
I am actually hungry.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.876
I'm ready to eat.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.006
Sweet.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.049
-Caprese salad.
-Thanks, ladies.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.928
Grab this.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.847
So, for your first
course tonight

21:03.888 --> 21:05.223
you have a deconstructed
Caprese salad.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.599
-That is beautiful.
-Caprese.

21:06.641 --> 21:07.600
Thank you.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.728
-Ooh!
-Mm!

21:09.769 --> 21:11.563
-You guys get some sleep.
-Sweet.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.939
Notice the portion size
got a little bigger.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.108
You finished?

21:15.150 --> 21:16.192
One bite, he took.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.193
How's the calamari?

21:17.235 --> 21:18.778
All gone.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.488
I'm gonna give them
a whole piece of filet.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.242
-That was so good.
-I enjoyed it.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.744
I'm feeling like some steak.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.746
Ooh, I think he said lobster.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.123
Oh, surf-and-turf.

21:30.165 --> 21:32.500
-Yo, are they happy?
-Really happy.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.836
This charter coming to an end,
it's a bittersweet feeling.

21:34.878 --> 21:37.088
It's not how I wanted
the season to end.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.215
Not every dish was perfect.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.217
Oh, that's hot...
the plates are hot.

21:41.259 --> 21:45.472
But given the circumstances
and the challenging requests,

21:45.513 --> 21:46.723
I feel like I did a good job.

21:46.765 --> 21:48.099
So for your
main course tonight...

21:48.141 --> 21:50.101
-Ooh!
-You have a surf-and-turf.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.103
-Yes.
-A shrimp...

21:52.145 --> 21:54.814
It's a baby lobster.

21:54.856 --> 21:55.857
Wow.

21:55.899 --> 21:56.858
That's good.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.610
Yeah, Mathew did his thing.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.695
I am so amazed with this dinner,
I can't even tell you.

22:00.737 --> 22:01.780
Last day.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.781
It's sad, you know?

22:02.822 --> 22:04.657
So, you forgive me?

22:04.699 --> 22:05.700
Yeah.

22:05.742 --> 22:06.826
Yeah?

22:06.868 --> 22:07.827
I don't wanna leave the boat.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.079
Yeah.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.789
Yeah, we didn't
get the cake yet.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.040
Corner.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.794
I don't know what's going
on with these cakes.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.631
Yeah, shame.

22:19.673 --> 22:21.257
So, happy birthday, guys.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.093
Is that a little cake?

22:23.134 --> 22:24.552
Do you guys like it?

22:27.847 --> 22:29.224
-Love it.
-You like your cake?

22:29.265 --> 22:30.225
Good.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.643
Oh, look at that.

22:31.685 --> 22:32.644
-Oh!
-That looks beautiful.

22:32.686 --> 22:34.062
Yes.

22:34.104 --> 22:35.730
I think you three should
get a picture with it.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.649
I'm just thankful at
this point

22:37.691 --> 22:39.984
that the guests are happy
with Mat's last meal.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.528
Number one, number one.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.029
Including the cakes.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.989
We'd like to bring
the cake inside.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.658
Yeah, you guys can eat inside.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.951
Mm, this is good.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.536
-Wow, that's really good.
-Mm.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.121
He's really good
at desserts, too.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.665
I really do appreciate
everyone here,

22:53.707 --> 22:56.835
and to just continue
in creating moments like this.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.003
I just wanted
to give you an update.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.254
Yes.

22:59.295 --> 23:00.922
So, they love the cake,
so thank you.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.007
Oh, good, thank you.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.591
I'm gonna go down.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.927
-How was the cake?
-It was amazing, big-time.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.138
-Good night.
-Yeah, have a nice sleep.

23:08.179 --> 23:09.889
You going?

23:09.931 --> 23:11.099
Do you girls need anything?

23:11.141 --> 23:12.809
I will wash; can you dry?

23:12.851 --> 23:14.602
Polish these with
that [bleep] glove.

23:14.644 --> 23:16.771
No, with this...
oh, darling.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.024
That is not how you
polish a glass, darling.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.119
Have a good night.

23:31.161 --> 23:32.287
We'll see you in the morning.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.875
-What time is it now?
-12:00.

23:36.916 --> 23:37.876
Oh, that's good.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.210
They're nice.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.211
Yeah, it's just her
that's a bit...

23:40.253 --> 23:41.212
-Athena?
-Yeah.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.255
Yeah...

23:47.052 --> 23:49.304
All right, going to bed.

23:49.346 --> 23:50.889
Lloyd's around,
if you need a hand.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.849
All right, cool, thanks, chica.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.235
[meows]

24:13.036 --> 24:14.037
Last day on the boat.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.250
Yeah, you gonna share, Mzi?

24:19.292 --> 24:21.002
This guy on Facebook,

24:21.044 --> 24:24.422
getting deep about setting
goals, and high-fiving himself.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.675
But it's just because
he came round to this chick.

24:28.718 --> 24:31.721
No, mate,
some aim higher than others.

24:31.763 --> 24:33.139
What are you thinking?

24:33.181 --> 24:34.974
You got this big sh---eating
grin on your face.

24:43.191 --> 24:44.317
Guess what today is?

24:44.359 --> 24:45.318
Say it.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.319
I miss you already.

24:46.361 --> 24:47.654
I'm really sorry.

24:47.696 --> 24:48.655
Good morning.

24:48.697 --> 24:49.989
How was your dinner?

24:50.031 --> 24:52.283
Oh, my gosh, Mathew just
worked out really well.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.952
It was so magical.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.913
Mathew has not had any
complaints about the food.

24:56.955 --> 25:00.291
Mathew's problem is Mathew...
that's it.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.293
Not the food.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.878
Deck crew, deck crew,

25:05.880 --> 25:06.881
Oh, yes.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.972
I'm sad today's the last day.

25:14.014 --> 25:17.017
It's starting to sink in
that, sh--, this is it.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.105
Thank you.

25:22.147 --> 25:23.815
I have to go finish packing,

25:23.857 --> 25:26.401
so I'll see you guys
down here at noon.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.862
All crew, all crew,
get into your whites.

25:28.903 --> 25:29.863
You guys ready?

25:29.904 --> 25:31.781
We're getting ready.

25:31.823 --> 25:34.367
-You need any help?
-Yes.

25:34.409 --> 25:36.036
My belt's too big.

25:38.121 --> 25:39.372
Are these all ready?

25:39.414 --> 25:41.958
Yeah.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.752
Malia, the luggage
is bigger than her.

25:43.793 --> 25:45.920
All crew, all crew,
please come to the aft deck.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.380
Whew!

25:49.382 --> 25:50.342
Hi.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.760
-Thank you.
-Bye.

25:51.801 --> 25:53.303
Thank you so much.

25:53.345 --> 25:55.013
-Mathew...
-Yes?

25:55.055 --> 25:56.014
The cuisine was exquisite.

25:56.056 --> 25:57.307
Thank you.

25:57.349 --> 25:58.767
Thank you for making
it special for us.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.018
Oh, you're welcome.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.436
-Forgive me, I don't...
-Courtney.

26:01.478 --> 26:03.104
Thank you,
it was nice to meet you,

26:03.146 --> 26:04.189
and I appreciate everything.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.231
-Yeah, you too.
-Thank you.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.941
No problem, you're welcome.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.401
My name's Courtney,
like [bleep]'s sake.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.403
Lexi, we appreciate you
making it so special for us.

26:10.445 --> 26:11.529
Oh, thank you.

26:11.571 --> 26:14.949
Katie, thank you so much.

26:14.991 --> 26:18.203
-Captain Sandy, thank you.
-Thank you.

26:18.244 --> 26:21.998
Thank you, my group
was so happy.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.292
It was just beautiful pampering,
and meaningful.

26:24.334 --> 26:25.919
Oh, thank you.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.212
Thank you, truly magical,
blissful moments.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.797
I appreciate this.

26:28.838 --> 26:30.048
I'm very pleased with
everything, okay?

26:30.090 --> 26:31.049
-Thank you very much.
-All the best.

26:31.091 --> 26:32.050
-Thank you.
-Bye!

26:32.092 --> 26:33.218
Bye!

26:33.259 --> 26:34.511
We love you!

26:34.552 --> 26:35.845
-Love you too!
-Bye!

26:35.887 --> 26:37.555
Nice work.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.516
Let's get into our reds, and
then we turn the boat around.

26:39.557 --> 26:41.935
-Woo!
-Woo, yeah, it's over.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.061
That was insane.

26:43.103 --> 26:44.062
-Athena.
-Ah.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.397
Oh.

26:45.438 --> 26:46.773
I'm so happy I got
to meet you guys.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.066
Yeah, it's been a time.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.193
Yeah, a solid time.

26:50.235 --> 26:52.237
<i>Mat, come</i>
<i>to the bridge, please.</i>

26:52.278 --> 26:54.531
<i>Captain Sandy, I am on my way.</i>

26:55.907 --> 26:57.367
Copy.

27:08.336 --> 27:09.295
<i>Mat, come to</i>
<i>the bridge, please.</i>

27:10.630 --> 27:11.589
<i>Coming now, Sandy.</i>

27:11.631 --> 27:13.341
----ing hell.

27:17.595 --> 27:21.391
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:21.433 --> 27:23.268
You know, I was in my cabin,

27:23.309 --> 27:26.021
and I was thinking about it,
and it's a hard situation.

27:26.062 --> 27:28.982
For me, it's like I need
to be able to trust my crew.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.442
Understood, yeah.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.193
I know everybody has
their breaking points,

27:32.235 --> 27:34.070
but I really appreciate
that you came back.

27:34.112 --> 27:35.238
That shows you care.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.531
You command your galley.

27:36.573 --> 27:39.617
Like, you have passion
in what you do,

27:39.659 --> 27:41.202
and everyone loves you...

27:41.244 --> 27:44.122
the clients, you know, like,
and the crew.

27:44.164 --> 27:47.584
I wanna finish with
the crew I start with.

27:47.625 --> 27:50.628
So, I'm gonna trust you
to finish the season out.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.547
-That means a lot to me.
-I'm gonna trust you.

27:52.589 --> 27:55.550
I am going to behave myself.

27:55.592 --> 27:58.345
I totally understood when
you made the decision before,

27:58.386 --> 28:00.972
and it was humbling,
but understandable.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.891
-And whew, that means...
-Yeah.

28:02.932 --> 28:03.975
-The world to me.
-All right, good.

28:04.017 --> 28:05.977
You know...
yes, of course.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.645
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

28:07.687 --> 28:08.980
Thank you so much.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.357
Wow.

28:10.398 --> 28:11.983
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

28:12.025 --> 28:13.902
<i>All crew, all crew,</i>

28:13.943 --> 28:16.112
<i>Mat will be staying for the</i>
<i>rest of the charter season.</i>

28:16.154 --> 28:18.156
And if he chooses
to walk off the boat,

28:18.198 --> 28:19.407
I think I'll drown him.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.201
Oh, my God.

28:21.242 --> 28:22.327
Let's meet in the main salon
for our tip meeting.

28:22.369 --> 28:23.620
We have a chef again.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.955
She's gonna give me
a third chance.

28:25.997 --> 28:27.165
Don't [bleep] it up.

28:27.207 --> 28:28.375
I'm not going to [bleep] it up.

28:28.416 --> 28:31.378
Yeah, I get to stay!

28:31.419 --> 28:32.462
Oh sh--!

28:34.422 --> 28:35.382
Happy for you, bru.

28:35.423 --> 28:36.383
Thank you...

28:36.424 --> 28:38.051
No more hiccups, no more rosé.

28:38.093 --> 28:40.553
And if so, by the glass,
not the bottle.

28:40.595 --> 28:42.055
I'm gonna stay this time.

28:43.723 --> 28:46.059
Thanks for joining us, Mathew.

28:46.101 --> 28:47.560
Thanks for letting me.

28:47.602 --> 28:51.398
Lexi, thank you for just keeping
your head in the game.

28:51.439 --> 28:55.568
And I love that you guys can go
through a lot emotionally,

28:55.610 --> 28:59.489
to the complete
reset of game on.

28:59.531 --> 29:02.242
That's incredible, so thank you.

29:02.283 --> 29:07.497
We got $15,000...
$1,244 U.S. dollars per person.

29:07.539 --> 29:09.082
That's a low tip.

29:09.124 --> 29:11.042
Thank you doesn't
pay the bills.

29:11.084 --> 29:12.460
The money is the praise for me.

29:12.502 --> 29:13.586
If you don't pat me
on the back with money,

29:13.628 --> 29:15.588
it's a ----ing issue.

29:15.630 --> 29:17.173
Anyway, congratulations,
enjoy your night.

29:17.215 --> 29:18.341
Thanks, Sandy.

29:18.383 --> 29:19.342
Cheers!

29:19.384 --> 29:20.593
Well done.

29:20.635 --> 29:22.429
-Game day.
-Thank you.

29:22.470 --> 29:23.555
So, we'll do the usual.

29:23.596 --> 29:27.267
Cool. Aces. Cheers.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.144
-You guys clear off the sundeck.
-The sundeck, yeah.

29:33.148 --> 29:34.315
Yes!

29:34.357 --> 29:36.735
Oh, I do love a storm.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.653
[sniffles]

29:44.284 --> 29:46.036
It's just loads
of little things today.

29:46.077 --> 29:48.455
Like, so obviously the main
guest, like, forgetting my name.

29:48.496 --> 29:52.584
Like, that, and then thanking
Lexi for being a normal human.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.003
I just kind of sat there
like maybe I should be a dick.

29:55.045 --> 29:58.340
Like, I'm just breaking
my back to get, like, nothing...

29:58.381 --> 30:00.342
like, it's sh--.

30:00.383 --> 30:02.177
Stop ----ing crying, Courtney.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.264
All right, it's done.

30:06.306 --> 30:09.351
And tonight, we shall party.

30:09.392 --> 30:11.186
Let's go have some fun.

30:13.605 --> 30:15.190
Are you excited for tonight?

30:24.157 --> 30:25.617
Let's get this show on the road.

30:25.658 --> 30:28.161
Cool.

30:28.203 --> 30:31.039
You know, last time we went out,
it wasn't really friendly.

30:31.081 --> 30:32.374
You're a fake-ass [bleep].

30:32.415 --> 30:34.125
You ain't worth--

30:34.167 --> 30:35.669
I mean, I wanna have
a drink, but I don't wanna,

30:35.710 --> 30:38.296
you know, go overboard.

30:38.338 --> 30:39.756
Oh, I have my nips out.

30:39.798 --> 30:41.424
I mean, you paid enough
money for them,

30:41.466 --> 30:43.218
you might as well get them
out from time to time.

30:45.637 --> 30:46.638
-For who?
-For the crew.

30:48.848 --> 30:51.351
No.

30:51.393 --> 30:53.353
If there was a girl
I was gonna genuinely be with...

30:53.395 --> 30:54.521
-Yes?
-It would be Malia.

30:54.562 --> 30:56.064
Yes.

30:56.106 --> 30:58.358
-Wow... oh!
-Whoa, you can, like, feel it.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.194
Malia's ----ing...
She is top of the ----ing game.

31:01.236 --> 31:02.696
Like, she's ----ing amazing.

31:02.737 --> 31:05.240
Malia, like, I've just...
it's a fine line.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.283
The last thing I wanna do
is overstep the mark.

31:07.325 --> 31:10.745
Like, silence is golden
with that one until...

31:10.787 --> 31:12.706
I'll be afraid
to make the first move,

31:12.747 --> 31:15.208
if there's ever a move to make,
and then it's safe in my hands.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.544
You dirty, dirty boy.

31:17.585 --> 31:19.379
Oi.

31:19.421 --> 31:20.880
Ooh, look at this.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.299
I'm gonna sit on that
side with the heater.

31:23.341 --> 31:24.592
Court, your legs look bangin'.

31:24.634 --> 31:26.428
Do they?

31:26.469 --> 31:27.429
You look amazing.

31:27.470 --> 31:28.680
-Good evening.
-Hello.

31:28.722 --> 31:30.890
May I have an
Aperol spritz, kind sir?

31:30.932 --> 31:33.268
I will do the burrata to start.

31:33.309 --> 31:34.561
I'll have one too, please.

31:34.602 --> 31:35.812
The prosciutto and
cheese platter.

31:35.854 --> 31:37.814
-Beef salad, yes.
-Beef salad. Yeah.

31:40.442 --> 31:41.568
Everyone's got their drinks?

31:41.609 --> 31:43.737
Yes, to no one quitting tonight.

31:43.778 --> 31:46.239
Yeah, please.

31:46.281 --> 31:47.407
Mat, we've locked your bags up.

31:47.449 --> 31:48.450
Oh!

31:48.491 --> 31:49.576
Mm, burrata.

31:49.617 --> 31:50.577
-All right!
-Bon appétit.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.746
Anyone want meat and cheese?

31:52.787 --> 31:54.414
-Dave-O.
-Dave-O.

31:54.456 --> 31:56.291
We need to give everyone
else a nickname.

31:56.332 --> 31:57.834
In the mornings, it's Coco.

31:57.876 --> 32:00.295
And then late in the night,
if we drink, it's Chloe.

32:02.589 --> 32:05.467
Chloe's just the drunk Courtney,
and she's a ho.

32:05.508 --> 32:07.177
Okay, what's
Mzi's stripper name?

32:07.218 --> 32:08.178
Mzi, what's your alter-ego?

32:08.219 --> 32:10.722
-Maverick!
-Yes!

32:15.518 --> 32:17.187
I respect that your generation,

32:17.228 --> 32:18.271
you're like it doesn't
make a difference

32:18.313 --> 32:19.856
whether you're male or female.

32:19.898 --> 32:20.940
It just depends, like,
if you're good at your job,

32:20.982 --> 32:22.400
which is how it should be.

32:22.442 --> 32:23.777
South African culture
generally is...

32:23.818 --> 32:25.445
it's very, very masculine.

32:25.487 --> 32:26.446
It is.

32:26.488 --> 32:27.781
I know, I get that, I get that.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.533
I was gonna ask you about
that...

32:30.575 --> 32:32.786
have how have you felt
in the industry?

32:45.340 --> 32:47.926
Race will always be an issue
in most things in life,

32:47.967 --> 32:50.845
especially in yachting, and it's
very male and white-dominated.

32:50.887 --> 32:52.555
But the way the world's going,

32:52.597 --> 32:53.932
there's a lot more eyes watching
what's happening

32:53.973 --> 32:55.767
in every single industry
in the world.

32:55.809 --> 32:57.769
So, it makes it a lot
more difficult

32:57.811 --> 32:59.646
for people to be
so discriminatory

32:59.688 --> 33:01.481
and get away with
things like that.

33:01.523 --> 33:04.192
So, I do think there
is progress, definitely.

33:04.234 --> 33:06.986
I hope in the next five
to 10 to 15 years

33:07.028 --> 33:10.865
it's gonna hopefully equal,
at least to a point.

33:10.907 --> 33:12.492
I know there's much...
there's still gonna be people

33:12.534 --> 33:13.702
that are influencing
the decisions.

33:13.743 --> 33:15.537
My last boat, my captain
would be, like,

33:15.578 --> 33:17.664
oh, this ----ing [bleep]
like,

33:17.706 --> 33:21.584
this, like, just, like,
horrible words the whole time.

33:21.626 --> 33:22.711
Like [bleep] having to deal
with that.

33:22.752 --> 33:24.379
That's ----ing twisted.

33:32.262 --> 33:33.888
I... just, I can't
listen this,

33:33.930 --> 33:35.682
it really gets me
----ing worked up.

33:35.724 --> 33:37.642
Mzi, don't worry...
on deck, you're just green.

33:37.684 --> 33:39.352
[laughing]

33:39.394 --> 33:40.645
Where do I put the tip?

33:40.687 --> 33:41.813
Just right there.

33:41.855 --> 33:43.440
Can you give me
my check as well?

33:43.481 --> 33:44.482
-It's all set.
-You paid for the entire thing?

33:44.524 --> 33:45.483
Yep.

33:45.525 --> 33:46.568
-Why?
-Why!

33:46.609 --> 33:47.861
-No!
-You guys can tip him.

33:47.902 --> 33:50.405
I'm not above
buying forgiveness.

33:50.447 --> 33:51.489
All right, let's go!

33:51.531 --> 33:52.866
I don't wanna vomit.

33:52.907 --> 33:54.451
Dave-O.

34:00.582 --> 34:01.875
Should I be worried?

34:01.916 --> 34:03.585
-About what?
-Being normal.

34:10.592 --> 34:11.843
Aw!

34:11.885 --> 34:13.720
The entire deck crew
is so happy.

34:13.762 --> 34:15.263
Good.

34:15.305 --> 34:16.556
I came from a situation
where it was, like,

34:16.598 --> 34:18.016
a toxic work relationship.

34:18.058 --> 34:20.477
Like, the most stressful
situation of my life.

34:20.518 --> 34:21.853
[bleep] yeah, I wanna
make deck fun, like it is.

34:21.895 --> 34:23.438
It can be so much fun.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.444
I actually believe that.

34:29.486 --> 34:31.571
If you go to these sex parties
and you pay for it...

34:31.613 --> 34:32.739
own it!

34:32.781 --> 34:33.948
-Yes.
-Yes, bru.

34:33.990 --> 34:36.284
You don't pay for
the sex party...

34:44.417 --> 34:46.044
All right, where's
the party tonight?

34:46.086 --> 34:47.712
-In the hot tub.
-The hot tub?

34:47.754 --> 34:50.590
-Hey!
-Woo!

34:50.632 --> 34:52.926
Little rooster's
come home to roost.

34:58.431 --> 34:59.766
You can come in, come in.

34:59.808 --> 35:00.809
I'm just waiting for Katie
to come out.

35:00.850 --> 35:01.893
Lexi, I'm very impressed by you.

35:01.935 --> 35:02.894
I'm actually not a fake person.

35:02.936 --> 35:04.479
-I know.
-I feel like...

35:04.521 --> 35:06.398
I feel sorry for judging you,
I really did.

35:06.439 --> 35:07.565
That's okay.

35:07.607 --> 35:09.317
Because, like, you
probably were...

35:09.359 --> 35:10.819
like, you were authentic,
and I took it the wrong way.

35:10.860 --> 35:12.696
I will say I'm waiting
for ----ing Katie,

35:12.737 --> 35:13.905
because I want a shower.

35:13.947 --> 35:16.616
Lexi's kind of a wild card,

35:16.658 --> 35:19.411
but if we all got judged
by our boozy nights,

35:19.452 --> 35:21.955
I'm pretty sure all of us
would be kicked off the boat.

35:21.996 --> 35:24.499
So, we should probably
give her a second chance.

35:26.001 --> 35:27.669
No, it's not.

35:27.711 --> 35:28.962
-Is it not?
-No.

35:29.004 --> 35:30.046
Oi [bleep].

35:30.088 --> 35:31.464
I'd rather go to the main salon.

35:31.506 --> 35:34.551
Main salon...
this is too cold for me.

35:37.429 --> 35:39.431
Yes, girl.

35:39.472 --> 35:40.807
Well, it was fun
whilst it lasted.

35:40.849 --> 35:43.018
Dancing!

35:43.059 --> 35:45.437
Water and ----ing banana.

35:45.478 --> 35:47.981
Lexi!

35:48.023 --> 35:49.024
Come join us.

35:49.065 --> 35:50.483
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Woo-hoo!

35:50.525 --> 35:51.526
Woo!

35:51.568 --> 35:53.903
Would you like a shot?

35:53.945 --> 35:54.904
I want someone to take one
with me, though.

35:54.946 --> 35:57.407
Take one with Lexi.

35:57.449 --> 35:58.658
Chase it with a banana.

35:58.700 --> 36:00.368
I love you, too.

36:00.410 --> 36:02.871
You better chase
that with a banana.

36:02.912 --> 36:04.581
I find it, like, hypocritical.

36:04.622 --> 36:06.916
They want you to,
like, take shots...

36:06.958 --> 36:08.001
-Yes, Lexi!
-Lexi!

36:08.043 --> 36:09.669
Hey, hey, hey!

36:09.711 --> 36:11.838
So, the last time I took shots,
everyone was not happy.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.131
So, which one is it?

36:13.173 --> 36:18.011
You want me to be
riled up, or not?

36:18.053 --> 36:19.012
Yes!

36:19.054 --> 36:20.055
[chanting]

36:22.599 --> 36:23.933
Yes, queen!

36:28.063 --> 36:29.064
Oh, God.

36:32.901 --> 36:35.862
-No!
-Whoa, David!

36:35.904 --> 36:37.489
Ooh!

36:39.157 --> 36:42.035
Oh, Lloyd, oh!

36:44.454 --> 36:46.081
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

36:46.122 --> 36:47.165
That's too adorable.

36:50.043 --> 36:52.671
They do, they're just
waiting for that moment.

36:55.215 --> 36:56.716
Come on.

36:59.552 --> 37:00.762
Hey!

37:05.141 --> 37:06.768
I love it!

37:22.117 --> 37:25.203
Oh, wow!

37:25.245 --> 37:27.872
I saw that!

37:27.914 --> 37:30.667
All right [bleep],
get your shot and you drink.

37:32.627 --> 37:34.879
I've been redeeming
myself all season.

37:34.921 --> 37:38.466
I don't want another reason
to have to redeem myself again.

37:38.508 --> 37:39.926
I'm just gonna sit this one out.

37:39.968 --> 37:41.594
Yeah!

37:41.636 --> 37:42.804
Awesome.

37:48.518 --> 37:50.020
Bad time?

37:50.061 --> 37:51.146
Get it, Lloyd!
Get it, Lloyd!

37:53.648 --> 37:55.859
-Yep.
-Okay.

37:55.900 --> 37:58.778
I was, like, what's Dave
and Malia talking about.

38:01.531 --> 38:02.949
I do remember the question.

38:02.991 --> 38:05.618
Ooh, it's too late
to reel it in.

38:05.660 --> 38:07.162
I was yearning for him
to look at my eyes

38:07.203 --> 38:10.915
so I could be like, don't do it.

38:26.723 --> 38:28.558
David on the go.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.310
Oh, he is dreaming.

38:30.352 --> 38:31.811
Yeah.

38:31.853 --> 38:33.938
He's ----ing out of his mind.

38:33.980 --> 38:34.981
Yeah.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.735
Sure.

39:06.930 --> 39:07.180
Sure.

39:08.682 --> 39:11.601
Oh, no, I can't,
I can't, this is a lot.

39:25.156 --> 39:26.866
Like, you're the powerful woman

39:26.908 --> 39:29.202
that every girl
should aspire to be,

39:34.082 --> 39:35.041
I'm your mum.

39:35.083 --> 39:36.167
No, honestly...

39:49.848 --> 39:50.849
That's fine.

39:55.353 --> 39:56.354
Savage.

39:57.439 --> 39:59.190
[bleep] my life.

39:59.232 --> 40:01.276
At least I got my answer, right?

40:02.986 --> 40:04.195
No.

40:17.834 --> 40:19.627
Oh, my God, Lloyd.

40:20.795 --> 40:22.839
That's...
babe, who cares?

40:22.881 --> 40:24.215
And, like...

40:24.257 --> 40:25.717
Does that matter...
does that matter?

40:25.759 --> 40:27.093
Does that...
Lloyd, look at me.

40:27.135 --> 40:29.179
Look at me, look at me...

40:29.220 --> 40:30.680
You are a beautiful
person, okay?

40:30.722 --> 40:31.848
You honestly are.

40:31.890 --> 40:33.975
Your soul is, like, insane.

40:41.316 --> 40:42.942
And the first time...

40:45.278 --> 40:46.863
We love you.

40:46.905 --> 40:50.658
I could not give a [bleep].
I don't care.

40:53.244 --> 40:54.954
And you know what?

40:54.996 --> 40:57.374
[bleep] those ----ing
[bleep] Lloyd.

40:57.415 --> 40:58.458
[bleep] them.

40:58.500 --> 41:01.211
There's nothing in here healthy.

41:01.252 --> 41:02.837
Lloyd, we support you.

41:11.137 --> 41:12.138
It's the first time what?

41:14.849 --> 41:17.018
Lloyd, come here.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.228
I love you.

41:18.269 --> 41:19.771
-Hey.
-That's fine.

41:21.940 --> 41:24.317
We ----ing love you, mate!

41:26.778 --> 41:30.156
Whoa, why am I going this way?

41:30.198 --> 41:33.243
We definitely need more Lloyds.

41:33.284 --> 41:35.995
Lloyd, I went to college.
I swung both ways.

41:36.037 --> 41:37.122
-[bleep] yeah, I still do.
-See?

41:37.163 --> 41:38.123
Exactly!

41:38.164 --> 41:39.165
Hey-o!

41:40.250 --> 41:42.711
If the world was full of Lloyds,

41:42.752 --> 41:45.088
imagine how good
the world would be.

41:45.130 --> 41:47.841
Right now, you're on a vessel
and everyone here

41:47.882 --> 41:50.510
accepts you for
everything you are.

41:50.552 --> 41:53.096
I don't ever want you to feel
like you can't be yourself,

41:53.138 --> 41:55.056
because the guys
that we have on deck,

41:55.098 --> 41:56.433
they aren't those sh---bag guys.

41:56.474 --> 41:58.059
-They're not.
-They love you.

41:58.101 --> 42:00.770
This industry is still
very old school,

42:00.812 --> 42:03.857
and as anyone
struggling with sexuality,

42:03.898 --> 42:05.734
you're expected
to behave a certain way

42:05.775 --> 42:07.027
or look a certain way.

42:07.068 --> 42:11.531
It's sh--.
It's really sh--.

42:11.573 --> 42:13.491
Ugh, it makes me so upset.

42:13.533 --> 42:16.077
Like, mm.

42:16.119 --> 42:17.287
We love you.

42:17.328 --> 42:18.538
-See you in the morning.
-Good night.

42:18.580 --> 42:19.873
Let's get you some water.

42:19.914 --> 42:20.874
Give me that.

42:20.915 --> 42:22.334
All right, bedtime.

42:22.375 --> 42:23.752
Yeah?

42:23.793 --> 42:25.170
-Meh.
-Good night.

42:25.211 --> 42:26.463
Come here.

42:29.966 --> 42:32.510
I talk about how I feel,

42:32.552 --> 42:36.431
my sexuality, all those sorts
of things with my best friend.

42:36.473 --> 42:38.391
The best description
I've had is the varying scale.

42:38.433 --> 42:41.978
You know, if someone wants
to be at one end of the scale

42:42.020 --> 42:44.230
and hard at that end,
whatever, who cares.

42:44.272 --> 42:46.441
And if the scale
wants to move up and down,

42:46.483 --> 42:50.070
depending where you are in
your life, why does anyone care?

42:50.111 --> 42:51.863
It's certainly something
that I've had on my mind

42:51.905 --> 42:53.281
since I was in school...

42:56.618 --> 42:59.412
but had very few people
to really talk about it,

42:59.454 --> 43:01.498
and quite a few friendship
groups

43:01.539 --> 43:04.793
where that wasn't really a thing
that would ever be discussed.

43:07.212 --> 43:10.006
-I love you.
-I love you.

43:12.217 --> 43:14.344
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:14.386 --> 43:16.429
Charter four,
Jennifer and Patrick

43:16.471 --> 43:18.098
are repeat charter guests.

43:18.139 --> 43:20.433
-This is Chad.
-They love to party.

43:20.475 --> 43:22.936
We drank 69 bottles
of booze in seven days.

43:22.977 --> 43:24.396
I need to order more alcohol.

43:24.437 --> 43:27.273
Captain Sandy, we have a
police vessel approaching.

43:27.315 --> 43:29.901
-I'm on my way.
-Uh-oh.

43:29.943 --> 43:31.569
I just went upstairs,
they're good.

43:31.611 --> 43:33.071
Oh, I'm out.

43:33.113 --> 43:34.447
I feel like
we've been forgotten.

43:34.489 --> 43:36.074
The boys need Tito's,
they're out.

43:36.116 --> 43:37.117
She just doesn't give
a [bleep] anymore.

43:37.158 --> 43:38.451
Can we get plates?

43:38.493 --> 43:39.911
-Are they not on the table?
-Negative.

43:39.953 --> 43:41.121
-Katie?
-This is a sh---show.

43:41.162 --> 43:42.455
My table wasn't set.

43:42.497 --> 43:43.456
I don't where the [bleep]
Lexi is, either.

43:43.498 --> 43:46.126
Why is this not hard?

43:46.167 --> 43:47.961
I don't care how much this
is a battle.

43:48.003 --> 43:49.295
-Yeah, this--
-We battle it.

43:49.337 --> 43:51.589
The slide is always drama.

43:51.631 --> 43:53.216
Fun.

43:53.258 --> 43:55.093
All I'm trying to do
is find a solution.

43:55.135 --> 43:56.428
I'm very aware of what happened.

43:56.469 --> 43:58.304
The slide just needs
the pump thing.

43:58.346 --> 44:01.057
All right, well calm down,
I'm not challenging you, Malia.

44:01.099 --> 44:02.142
Oh, my God.

44:02.183 --> 44:03.309
What's wrong?

44:03.351 --> 44:04.477
Just a bit of a mess.

44:04.519 --> 44:05.979
Okay.

44:06.021 --> 44:07.355
I don't like giving up
on people,

44:07.397 --> 44:09.315
but when the person
isn't willing to change,

44:09.357 --> 44:10.608
then that's a problem.

44:12.027 --> 44:13.361
[sighs]
