WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:04.403
â™ª

00:04.405 --> 00:05.537
"the defriender."

00:05.539 --> 00:07.239
That's what people
are calling me?

00:07.241 --> 00:09.541
That's what the nurses
are calling you.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.676
Okay. You know what?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.244
If it means
what I think it means,

00:12.246 --> 00:13.779
I have not "defriended"
a nurse...
(chuckles)

00:13.781 --> 00:15.781
In, like,
almost three months.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.583
Are you seeing someone?

00:17.585 --> 00:19.518
Yes, I am, actually.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.586
That's... Great.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.021
That's amazing.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.455
Yeah, I mean,
it's early days, yeah.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.792
She's a sweet girl, though.
She has a kid, actually.

00:26.794 --> 00:30.729
I'm happy for you.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.165
Okay, we are on
the wrong road.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.167
And that little bouncy ball
is totally gone.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.502
We're gonna have to find
somewhere to stop.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.070
Don't worry about it.
It's like a big resort.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.371
There'll be signs for it
everywhere--

00:39.373 --> 00:40.739
Oh, I remember this well,
joel...
What?

00:40.741 --> 00:42.408
Your instinctive
sense of direction.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.542
We will get somewhere,

00:43.544 --> 00:44.777
But it won't be
the trauma conference.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.578
It'll be a b&b
where you make your own jam.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.614
Ouch! Holy!

00:48.616 --> 00:50.115
You know what?
(chuckles)

00:50.117 --> 00:51.550
One--my jam was delicious.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.185
Two--you had an excellent--
joel, that's not the point.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.788
You had an excellent time
on that trip.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.089
And you know what?
For the record,

00:57.091 --> 00:58.524
I cannot believe
that charlie--

00:58.526 --> 01:00.225
You know, I can't believe
that any man would give up

01:00.227 --> 01:02.227
A dirty weekend with you
at a medical conference

01:02.229 --> 01:03.595
Just to go and pick up
his friend at the airport,

01:03.597 --> 01:06.098
I'm just saying.
It's ford.
It's his best friend.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.299
(singsongy) dirty weekend.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.268
That's why you don't
have any friends.

01:09.270 --> 01:12.137
By the way, charlie is coming.
He's just running late.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.239
(chuckles) hey,
there's a gas station.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.307
Pull over.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.675
You got it.

01:16.677 --> 01:25.284
â™ª

01:26.753 --> 01:29.488
(siren whoops, radio chatter)

01:29.490 --> 01:32.524
Hey.
Zach, this, uh, fiend here
is thomas ford--

01:32.526 --> 01:34.827
My friend, former roommate,
and general hell-raiser.
(gurney clacks)

01:34.829 --> 01:37.529
Welcome, thomas ford.
What, uh, is the problem?

01:37.531 --> 01:38.831
Um, ford flew commercial

01:38.833 --> 01:40.265
From the central
south african republic

01:40.267 --> 01:41.667
With some apparent
leg trouble.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.268
Exactly. I traveled
thousands of miles,

01:43.270 --> 01:45.671
And he's mad because
I screwed up his plans with who?

01:45.673 --> 01:47.473
Alex.
Alex. Alex?

01:47.475 --> 01:49.541
I don't know.
I stopped at dawn, buddy.
(chuckles)

01:49.543 --> 01:51.210
You met alex, ford.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.177
We had four bottles of wine,
and you tried to kiss her.

01:52.179 --> 01:53.412
Yeah, I don't remember names

01:53.414 --> 01:54.680
Until I'm sure they'll stick,
my friend.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.281
So what do you do over there

01:56.283 --> 01:58.517
In the central
south african republic?
I take pictures.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.819
You ever see that photo
of the, uh, woman in karachi

02:00.821 --> 02:02.688
Holding her child--
the one with the, um--

02:02.690 --> 02:03.622
With the eyes
in front of the thing--

02:03.624 --> 02:05.491
You took that?
Yeah.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.292
I got it, I got it,
I got the leg.
(grunts) thanks, charles.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.294
My hero.
(grunts) all right.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.897
Start a dopamine drip
and get him pip tazo.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.566
So what happened? You, uh,
get shot over there?

02:14.568 --> 02:15.734
No. I got hit by a truck.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.169
Got too close to the action.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.170
They patched me up
in a field hospital,

02:18.172 --> 02:19.371
But I had a sense I should

02:19.373 --> 02:21.306
Get home to a real doctor.
Scissors.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.875
He flew like this?
He greased
the flight attendants.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.309
Charles,
my straight-laced chum.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.678
Open up the present.
You'll see why.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.181
(indistinct conversations)

02:31.269 --> 02:34.268
Check out  www.DDLValley.eu       for the latest tv shows, movies & more

02:36.356 --> 02:37.489
(gasps)

02:37.491 --> 02:39.725
Oh.
Oh.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.361
(chuckles)

02:42.363 --> 02:43.662
(groans)

02:43.664 --> 02:45.797
Charles...

02:45.799 --> 02:47.466
You can fix this, right?

02:50.937 --> 02:53.405
Where are you going?

02:53.407 --> 02:55.874
I'm late,
and I don't really want

02:55.876 --> 02:57.709
To give my presentation
in a pair of jeans.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.312
Ooh, I remember this one.
What?

03:00.314 --> 03:01.880
The inevitable breakdown
that happens

03:01.882 --> 03:03.382
Whenever you think
you're gonna be late.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.883
Okay,
this isn't a breakdown.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.518
I have to give a speech
on the laparoscopic repair

03:06.520 --> 03:08.754
Of diaphragmatic injuries
in an hour and a half.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.355
And the last time I checked,
we were, oh,

03:10.357 --> 03:11.790
Two hours away
from the damn hotel.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.927
We're closer than two hours.

03:14.929 --> 03:17.863
No, no, no.
No, it's okay, love.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.933
I've got it.

03:30.643 --> 03:33.378
Okay. So, uh...

03:33.380 --> 03:35.681
Do you want me to change
the dinner reservation then?

03:35.683 --> 03:37.382
(charlie) uh, probably.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.251
I'm sorry, honey. I know this
was supposed to be our weekend--

03:39.253 --> 03:40.953
Give me that.
Give me that.

03:40.955 --> 03:42.988
Alex reid,
you gorgeous woman,

03:42.990 --> 03:45.390
Lover of charles,
healer of mankind.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.493
Shouldn't you be in some
war zone somewhere, ford--

03:48.495 --> 03:51.797
Sneaking into some
beautiful woman's tent?

03:51.799 --> 03:54.266
(chuckles)
alex, I love you.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.834
I know charles loves you.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.970
But you're gonna have to stay--
for the moment at least--

03:57.972 --> 04:00.405
Separated, for I am in need
of a physician.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.808
And the physician I need
is the same man that you love.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.610
Charles is his name.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.777
Are you stoned?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.679
No. No. It's probably
the pain meds.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.381
This is very real,
I assure you.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.550
There, she totally
forgives you.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.553
Up his dopamine, and give him
25 mikes of fentanyl.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.021
And hit him over the head
with a baseball bat.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.623
(chuckles)
hey, um,

04:17.625 --> 04:20.025
I will get on the road
as soon as I can. But, um...

04:20.027 --> 04:23.295
Ford's...
Kind of in a bad way.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.431
(sighs) in a bad way,
like, hungover?

04:26.433 --> 04:29.434
No. Bad like his leg
is mangled and he's septic.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.337
I'm sorry, honey.
I gotta go.
(sighs) he's your friend.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.573
Fix his leg.
(sighs) I love you.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.941
Love you.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.543
(cell phone beeps)

04:42.715 --> 04:45.651
(gas tank lid clunks)

04:45.653 --> 04:48.920
(birds chirping)

04:52.992 --> 04:56.595
(cash register beeps)
(woman) you're gonna have
to muzzle that dog.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.764
(sighs)
(woman)
I know. He's aggressive.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.333
<i>(man) â™ª bring me down</i>

05:01.335 --> 05:02.701
â™ª <i>make me blue â™ª</i>

05:02.703 --> 05:04.903
You might want
to get that checked out, man.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.605
What?
The tattoo.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.874
Whoever did that
does not know how to autoclave.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.810
It's--you might want to get
checked out for hep-c as well,

05:11.812 --> 05:12.944
By the looks of things.

05:12.946 --> 05:13.945
It's pretty bad.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.080
What are you, a lawyer?

05:15.082 --> 05:16.481
No, I'm a doctor, man.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.983
Honestly, that looks
pretty damn fierce.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.385
You could--you don't want
a deep infection, or--

05:20.387 --> 05:21.553
Are you--
are you feeling okay, man?

05:21.555 --> 05:23.955
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.991
I'm really good. I just--
hey, energy drink,

05:25.993 --> 05:27.092
You gonna pay or what?

05:27.094 --> 05:28.560
(gun cocks)
empty the cash.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.095
Whoa, dude!
Right now. On the counter!

05:30.097 --> 05:31.563
Don't stand there!
Do it!
Okay.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.031
Gimme your wallet.
Gimme me your keys,

05:33.033 --> 05:34.633
Phone, everything, now!
Yeah. Y-you got it!

05:34.635 --> 05:36.034
(slaps counter)
on the counter! On the counter!

05:36.036 --> 05:36.935
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Okay.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.004
Hurry up! Hurry up!

05:39.006 --> 05:40.472
(slaps cash register)
empty it! Let's go!

05:40.474 --> 05:42.040
Quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick! Motor!

05:42.042 --> 05:43.375
Where's the safe?!

05:43.377 --> 05:44.509
We don't have a safe.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.044
You don't have a safe?
No.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.513
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Look, okay.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.115
These are my car keys,
all right?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.783
(keys jingle)
okay, man,
it's parked outside.

05:51.785 --> 05:52.984
Take it.
(keys jingle)

05:52.986 --> 05:54.519
(gun clicks)
that's it?! That's all?!

05:54.521 --> 05:56.388
Dude, the car's worth
a lot of money. Just take it.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.056
(door bells jingle)
joel, did you fi--

05:58.058 --> 05:59.491
Alex!
Lie down!

05:59.493 --> 06:01.460
Lie down on the ground!
Okay!

06:01.462 --> 06:02.994
Give me the purse.
Throw it to me.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.396
Okay, okay!
Okay, buddy, you got
what you wanted. It's--

06:04.398 --> 06:06.064
You, move! Go! Go!
(grunts)

06:06.066 --> 06:09.468
(objects clatter,
bills rustle)

06:12.805 --> 06:14.706
(whispers) stay down.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.774
(coins jingle)

06:15.776 --> 06:16.908
Where's the money?!

06:16.910 --> 06:18.810
Why don't you have
any more money?

06:18.812 --> 06:21.012
You have all our money!
Shut up!

06:21.014 --> 06:23.815
(grunts and groans)

06:23.817 --> 06:27.552
(objects clatter)

06:27.554 --> 06:28.420
Joel!

06:28.422 --> 06:30.722
(groaning)
I got it.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.159
Ugh!
How is she?

06:34.161 --> 06:35.727
Let me see it.
(tires peal, vehicle departs)

06:35.729 --> 06:37.829
Ah, it hit her femoral vein.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.598
She's bleeding out.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.044
What's your name?
Diane.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.746
Okay.
Diane, we're doctors.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.581
(grunts)
we're gonna
take care of you.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.983
Okay?
(breathing heavily)

06:57.985 --> 06:59.551
We need to check
for an exit wound.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.186
Let's roll her. Yeah.
You ready, diane?

07:01.188 --> 07:02.988
(grunts)
(groans)

07:02.990 --> 07:04.623
(strained voice) ow.
Oh, yeah.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.158
Yeah. There's an exit wound
here at the gluteal fold.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.660
Um, give me a second.
Okay. Got it.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.730
All right.
Let's lower her.
(groaning)

07:11.732 --> 07:12.831
I will keep pressure.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.566
We've gotta call for medics.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.767
You know,
he's got my phone.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.670
Mine was in my bag.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.139
Does the wall phone work,
diane?
Yeah. Works great.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.109
Okay, I got it.
(phone receiver clatters)

07:24.111 --> 07:25.610
I know you're scared,

07:25.612 --> 07:27.446
But I'm here with you
the whole way, okay?

07:27.448 --> 07:28.880
Come on. Come on.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.016
Yes, I would like an ambulance,
uh, at the gas station

07:31.018 --> 07:33.018
Off rural route 3, please.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.519
We're on concession road 4.

07:34.521 --> 07:35.687
Concession road 4
is what I meant.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.222
Stay with me.
Okay, well... Yes.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.723
You're doing a good job,
diane.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.592
Uh, I'm a doctor.
I'm telling you that we have

07:40.594 --> 07:42.494
A woman here
with a serious g.S.W.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.930
In her upper thigh.
(sighs)

07:44.932 --> 07:47.799
Okay. Uh, yeah, okay.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.234
(telephone dings)

07:49.236 --> 07:51.136
What do we got?
45 minutes.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.872
What?
I said 45 minutes, alex.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.073
Joel!

07:55.075 --> 07:57.042
(diane) how long you guys
been married?

07:57.044 --> 07:59.244
(grunts)

07:59.246 --> 08:01.012
All right, thomas.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.647
I'm going to tell you
exactly what's happening,

08:02.649 --> 08:04.649
And I know you won't
freak out.
(chuckles)

08:04.651 --> 08:07.219
Do I get more awesome drugs
if I do freak out?

08:07.221 --> 08:10.255
You have a compound tibial
fracture, obviously.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.123
It's broken
in several places.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.192
And that
crazy-looking thing

08:14.194 --> 08:16.061
Is keeping your leg
from falling apart.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.597
But the whole thing
is badly infected.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.565
I gon--am I gonna lose
my leg?

08:20.567 --> 08:23.935
The infection has spread
to your lymph nodes.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.905
So you might--
you might lose your leg, yes.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.807
(sniffs) great.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.809
A war photographer
in a wheelchair.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.111
You'll see all the women
tearing up over that one, huh?

08:33.113 --> 08:35.947
Charlie... (sighs)

08:35.949 --> 08:38.817
Charles. <i>Hombre....</i>

08:38.819 --> 08:42.187
I can't work with one leg.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.922
We'll do the best we can,
okay?

08:43.924 --> 08:46.658
No, don't give me that line,
all right? Just...

08:46.660 --> 08:48.760
Fix my leg.

08:48.762 --> 08:53.965
(monitor beeps)
you're pissed off at me, huh?

08:53.967 --> 08:56.034
For screwing up your weekend?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.770
Yeah. Yeah, I am
pissed off at you.
(laughs)

08:58.772 --> 09:01.773
But alex is gonna understand.
Because she knows I never

09:01.775 --> 09:03.975
Get to spend any
quality time with you.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.243
Oh, that's sweet.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.312
It is, isn't it?
She must be the one.

09:07.314 --> 09:11.116
(laughs)
we're gonna get you
through this, buddy.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.585
Hey, charles.

09:13.587 --> 09:17.722
See ya on the other side.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.991
(whooshes)

09:19.993 --> 09:22.727
(wrapper crinkles)

09:22.729 --> 09:24.262
Okay, so obviously
these are for cars,

09:24.264 --> 09:26.131
But they'll do for now.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.033
I'm sorry I snapped at you
before.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.100
That's okay.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.936
Diane, how are you feeling?

09:30.938 --> 09:32.604
Cold as a well digger's ass.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.140
(grunts)
can you grab that blanket
for me?

09:35.142 --> 09:36.041
You got it.
Okay.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.676
Diane, you're in shock.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.844
We're gonna get you warm,
and we're gonna get you help.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.146
Where's jack?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.814
Jack?

09:42.816 --> 09:45.817
My husband.
Where's your husband,
diane?

09:45.819 --> 09:48.353
Okay. Well, I'll go
look for your husband

09:48.355 --> 09:50.288
As soon as we get
this bleeding under control.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.756
I had needles and sutures
in my car.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.092
Well, I hope he's enjoying
his joyride.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.727
Where's your car parked,
diane?

09:55.729 --> 09:56.861
It's busted.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.229
Jack's working on it.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.931
That's good to know.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.266
Pulse is thready.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.334
Her wound won't stop oozing.

10:02.336 --> 10:03.802
We need to tamponade
the bleeding.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.204
Okay, I need a tube,
something narrow,

10:06.206 --> 10:07.706
Dental floss, and a condom.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.774
Are you gonna macgyver
a balloon tamponade?

10:09.776 --> 10:10.909
Yeah, we are.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.243
Yes, ma'am.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.950
This is bewildering.
It is really bewildering.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.187
Every doctor gets
a complaint at some point.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.956
I mean, if you want
to come in and talk about it--
what?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.391
That would be absurd.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.028
Hello.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.129
What is that for?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.330
I'm going into
an 8-hour surgery.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.865
I thought I'd get
some sugar first.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.334
Can I get your opinion
on something first, dr. Lin?

10:36.336 --> 10:38.069
I have a patient
with a brain tumor.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.205
And he's lodged
a complaint against me.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.673
Why?
Apparently,

10:41.675 --> 10:43.041
I have bad bedside manner.

10:43.043 --> 10:46.211
(scoffs) really?
(chuckles)
well, you kinda do.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.712
Now I have to tell him

10:47.714 --> 10:49.814
That his tumor was wrapped
around his brain stem.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.950
See, don't say it like that.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.952
Look, I don't see why
he expects false empathy

10:53.954 --> 10:56.421
It's not gonna change
his outcome.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.823
Well, not all empathy
is false, right?

10:58.825 --> 11:01.826
Mnh-mnh. Studies show that
patients actually do better

11:01.828 --> 11:03.261
If they feel
their doctor likes them.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.663
Not mine.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.797
You see, the brain--
it has no nerves.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.232
This whole thing
is ridiculous.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.100
Most of my patients
can't even move.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.369
You should be happy
yours can still get mad.

11:11.371 --> 11:14.439
I just don't know
what he wants from me.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.808
Look, those complaints
can haunt you, shahir.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.376
Medicine is like fast food
these days.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.844
Customer's always right.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.112
You should take this
seriously.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.247
I gotta go.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.248
See ya.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.750
She's right.

11:25.752 --> 11:27.385
Especially if you want
to be chief one day.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.953
I do want to be chief.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.955
Except for the dealing
with the people part.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.724
But I would just delegate that
once I had the power.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.159
<i>Ay!</i> Not that I would
abuse the power.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.127
No, no, no. I would be
a benevolent dictator.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.763
Something a little bit more
nicer--benevolent.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.265
That's the key word here.
"benevolent."

11:40.267 --> 11:42.701
Dr. Hamza--
and if I was your--

11:42.703 --> 11:44.736
Why don't you let me
help you out?

11:44.738 --> 11:45.837
How?

11:45.839 --> 11:46.971
Come with me.

11:49.475 --> 11:53.311
(monitor beeping steadily)

11:53.313 --> 11:56.881
God, that ex-fix is <i>gnarly.</i>

11:56.883 --> 11:59.050
I know. I've seen better
surgical equipment

11:59.052 --> 12:00.151
In the tower of london.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.853
(nail clatters)

12:01.855 --> 12:03.855
How did he get on a plane
with that?

12:03.857 --> 12:05.990
How? 'cause he's thomas ford,
that's how.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.892
He's... A maniac.

12:07.894 --> 12:11.162
(clatters)
so we're doing
an above-the-knee amputation?

12:11.164 --> 12:13.431
No. We are saving the leg.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.400
His mess score is 8.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.836
That usually indicates
an amputation.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.071
I've known this guy
since college.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.240
We're saving his leg.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.909
Okay. Knife.
(nail clatters)

12:24.911 --> 12:26.444
We'll cut away
the infected tissue,

12:26.446 --> 12:28.046
Irrigate the wounds...
(nail clatters)

12:28.048 --> 12:29.314
And see what we've got.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.049
It's gonna be a long day.

12:32.218 --> 12:34.919
Well, my weekend's
already shot.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.856
(thud)

12:47.099 --> 12:48.333
Um, dr. Harris?

12:48.335 --> 12:50.335
Hmm?

12:50.337 --> 12:52.804
Maggots.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.774
Are you sure you wanna
save the leg?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.210
(clacks)

13:07.219 --> 13:08.319
(wrapper crinkles)

13:08.321 --> 13:09.788
(blows air)
all right, diane.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.289
This should put pressure
on your femoral vein

13:11.291 --> 13:12.891
And stop the bleeding.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
Here you go.

13:15.962 --> 13:19.097
Thanks.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.365
And for the record...

13:20.367 --> 13:21.800
You know, alex and I
were never married.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.268
You seem miserable enough.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.036
Well, I asked her once,
actually.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.338
What do you mean,
I did not?

13:27.340 --> 13:28.907
After you passed
your board exams,

13:28.909 --> 13:30.008
I made you that dinner.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.377
You came home,
off shift, late...

13:32.379 --> 13:33.812
(sighs)
threw some noodles on,

13:33.814 --> 13:35.213
And asked me if
I wanted to get married.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.982
No ring.
Okay, I was
a first year resident.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.585
Jack bought a ring
from the vending machine.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.320
See? Now that's romantic.
(sighs)

13:42.322 --> 13:43.822
Not...
(imitating joel) "hey, alex,

13:43.824 --> 13:45.256
Do you want to try
the whole marriage thing?"

13:45.258 --> 13:47.992
That's not my voice.
(laughs)

13:47.994 --> 13:51.996
Okay, this is going to hurt,
but it's gonna get you better.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.265
Okay, you ready?
Not really.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.366
Here we go.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.402
(groaning)
that's it.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.537
Good job, diane.
It's okay.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.905
Hang in there.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.274
(groaning continues)
that's it, diane.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.143
Ohh! (grunts)
there we are.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.245
Did it go through?
Yeah, you're looking good.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.313
Okay, thank you.
Nice.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.882
Here we go.
Yeah.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.151
(blows air)
very nice.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.619
(panting and groaning)
looking good.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.188
Another one.
Yeah.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.990
(grunts)

14:18.992 --> 14:21.492
The bleeding stopped, diane.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.529
(crying)
nice work. Look at that.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.164
Where's jack?

14:26.166 --> 14:29.133
Okay. I don't know
how long it'll hold.
Okay.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.501
I'm gonna look for
your husband now.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.036
Okay, diane?
Mm.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.272
You should wait here.
Okay.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.908
You did a good job.
You were very brave.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.611
(door bells jingle)

14:40.512 --> 14:42.647
Jack?!

14:51.123 --> 14:52.457
Jack!

14:52.459 --> 14:56.127
Hey! Hey, buddy. Jack.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.328
Jack?

14:57.330 --> 14:58.897
Jack, can you hear me?

14:58.899 --> 15:01.232
Hey... Now.
(fingers slapping)

15:01.234 --> 15:03.234
Can you hear me?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.438
(grunting)

15:07.440 --> 15:10.008
That's it. That's it.
Welcome back.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.976
Kid in an audi
tried to run me over.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.978
Actually, it was a lexus.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.080
Whatever it was,
he was trying to hit me.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.082
Well, I'd say
that he succeeded.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.918
He didn't hurt diane,
did he?

15:19.920 --> 15:21.085
That kid looked shifty.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.554
Your wife's gonna be
just fine.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.523
Tell me something.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.158
Does this hurt?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.459
Aah!

15:28.461 --> 15:29.694
I'll take that as a "yes."
(grunts)

15:29.696 --> 15:32.630
Can you wiggle your toes?
Uh--uh, yeah.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.465
But my leg hurts like hell.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.633
Is it broken?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.502
Yeah, it is.
Luckily, you're built like

15:37.504 --> 15:38.603
A russian mountain climber,
though,

15:38.605 --> 15:40.071
So you're probably
gonna be fine.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.472
Do you have a creeper inside
or something?

15:41.474 --> 15:43.174
Uh--uh, yeah.
All right.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.710
Just--I'll be right back,
okay? Trust me.
(grunts)

15:45.712 --> 15:47.245
(weakly) okay, all right.
Stay still.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.480
Uh-huh. (groaning)

15:49.482 --> 15:51.716
Alex!

15:51.718 --> 15:53.284
Hey!
(alex) joel?

15:53.286 --> 15:54.485
I found jack.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.586
He's got a broken femur,
a concussion,

15:55.588 --> 15:56.688
He might even have
a spinal fracture.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.323
Car threw him
at least 10 feet.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.524
Can you move him?

15:59.526 --> 16:00.525
Well, I can't just
leave him out there.

16:00.527 --> 16:01.592
How's she doing in there?

16:01.594 --> 16:03.027
Hanging in there,
barely.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.429
You know what we could use
right now?

16:04.431 --> 16:05.997
An ambulance.
Yeah.

16:09.201 --> 16:12.036
Okay. Let's do some
role-playing.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.137
Zach will be our patient.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.639
Hey, zach.
Do you mind, uh,

16:14.641 --> 16:16.040
Doing some role-playing
with us?

16:16.042 --> 16:18.576
Um, sure, yeah.
Can I have an eye patch?

16:18.578 --> 16:20.011
Sure.
Okay.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.512
My patient
doesn't have an eye patch.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.648
Then no. All right--
okay. Whoa--whoa.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.383
What do I got? Like,
a brain problem, I guess?

16:25.385 --> 16:28.419
A glioma.
Yikes.
No, I can do that.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.554
Okay, what do I do
for a living?

16:29.556 --> 16:31.055
Oh, you play the piano.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.557
Okay, yeah.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.559
Am I more like, uh,
like liberace?

16:34.561 --> 16:36.160
Or like billy joel?

16:36.162 --> 16:38.763
Are you--are you asking
about your sexuality?

16:38.765 --> 16:42.033
No. I'm asking about
my style of playing.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.534
But wait, am I gay
or am I straight?

16:43.536 --> 16:44.569
Well,
you should know by now.

16:44.571 --> 16:45.703
Doesn't matter.
You should--

16:45.705 --> 16:47.038
Okay, then just
riddle me this--

16:47.040 --> 16:49.340
Am I a thin guy
or am I a fat guy?

16:49.342 --> 16:50.508
It doesn't matter, de niro.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.677
You're thin,
and that's not a riddle.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.711
Let's just start.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.279
Zach, you be the patient.
Okay.

16:55.281 --> 16:58.216
Shahir, try to talk to him
about his condition.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.417
Okay.

17:01.286 --> 17:04.055
Okay. (clears throat)

17:04.057 --> 17:06.190
What are you doing,
dr. Miller?

17:06.192 --> 17:09.427
What--
I'm being a thin pianist.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.163
(chuckles) it sounds like
you said "thin penis."

17:12.165 --> 17:13.464
Just give him the news.
You don't have it.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.466
Huh?
All right.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.734
Give him the news.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.203
Mr. Penn, you're gonna die.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.738
<i>What?</i>

17:20.740 --> 17:23.174
Why? I don't understand.
I'm a good christian.

17:23.176 --> 17:26.411
Okay, so make eye contact,
speak slowly,

17:26.413 --> 17:28.179
Use active listening.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.281
Don't be afraid
to use physical contact.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.551
<i>(man speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

17:33.553 --> 17:35.453
(clears throat)

17:35.455 --> 17:36.788
(clears throat)

17:36.790 --> 17:40.091
Well, your... Tumor
has enveloped your brain stem.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.126
I've never seen anyone
survive this, ever.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.228
I should also mention--
perhaps tangentially--

17:44.230 --> 17:46.664
That the efficacy of prayer
in these circumstances

17:46.666 --> 17:49.200
Has been shown to be
of limited benefit.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.169
How's that?

17:52.304 --> 17:54.505
All right, jack. We do not have
a neck immobilizer,

17:54.507 --> 17:56.140
But we do have this...

17:56.142 --> 17:59.243
Fine pillow from
your wonderful store--$9.95.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.112
And I'm gonna duct tape
your head to keep it stable.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.513
I owe you 5 bucks
for that, too, mate.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.515
Oh, and the best part is
when we take it off,

18:04.517 --> 18:07.318
You get a free haircut.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.220
Diane likes my hair.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.222
Yeah? What else does
diane like?
Ah...

18:11.224 --> 18:14.759
Poker... Wine...

18:14.761 --> 18:15.860
Public radio.
How about you?

18:15.862 --> 18:17.428
What kind of music
do you like?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.397
Uh, classic rock.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.833
Do you like to crank it
in the garage

18:21.835 --> 18:23.601
When you're working
on your cars?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.804
Yeah. Diane likes bluegrass.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.439
Opposites attract.
Yeah.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.641
That's how you know you're gonna
be with someone, right?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.777
'cause they make you mad?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.545
Okay, we're good to go.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.748
(grunts)
okay.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.185
(vehicle approaching)

18:44.156 --> 18:47.225
(grunts)
we're gonna be okay.

18:47.227 --> 18:50.294
Hey! Hey!

18:52.264 --> 18:53.764
You just gotta listen
to my voice.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.533
We're gonna get you guys
out of this.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.168
Okay. (exhales)

18:57.170 --> 18:58.703
Anything?
Nothing.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.872
(both exhale sharply)
(grunts)

19:00.874 --> 19:02.807
Okay, let's get him inside.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.308
This is gonna be
a bumpy ride.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.878
Just hold tight, buddy.
Okay.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.914
(wheels clacking)
(grunting)

19:09.916 --> 19:11.582
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:11.584 --> 19:13.384
I think I got 'em all.

19:16.522 --> 19:19.824
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is why I gave up composting.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.659
And the presence of maggots
in the wound

19:21.661 --> 19:23.327
Means what, dr. Lin?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.429
That the patient delayed
seeking treatment.

19:25.431 --> 19:28.599
That the patient's leg
is severely infected.
(object clacks)

19:28.601 --> 19:31.435
That the patient has
a very high pain threshold.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.771
Basically, your friend
is a superhero.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.207
I mean, this guy
is insane, right?

19:36.942 --> 19:39.744
There's a bunch
of metal artifact

19:39.746 --> 19:41.879
From old wounds in here.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.615
Shrapnel, probably.
(clinks)

19:44.617 --> 19:47.585
Is--is that a bullet?

19:47.587 --> 19:49.387
Yeah.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.589
(monitor beeps)

19:53.759 --> 19:56.827
(tape ripples)

19:56.829 --> 19:58.629
They fixed you up good,
jack.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.897
(strained voice) yeah.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.432
Well, your husband's got
a cardboard splint.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.267
And I got blood
all over your blanket.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.269
So you might want
to reserve judgment.

20:05.271 --> 20:08.372
You hanging in okay,
sweetness?
Yep.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.374
I'm doing good.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.509
Joel.
Yeah.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.878
He didn't get the lockbox.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.947
(jack) you know how much
was in there?

20:15.949 --> 20:18.849
No.
85 bucks.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.818
Nearly got us killed
for less than 100 bucks.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.853
(chuckles) that's love.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.889
(alex) hi,
this is dr. Alex reid.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.891
My colleague called
at least an hour ago.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.293
We're at the gas station
on concession road 4.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.629
I've got a g.S.W. And a man
who was run over by a car here.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.532
We need help. Any kind of help
would be great.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.534
No. I-I'm not yelling.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.272
Thank you.
Where's the ambulance?

20:41.274 --> 20:43.641
On its way to town
with our meth head in it.

20:43.643 --> 20:44.675
He crashed your car.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.544
Okay. So...

20:46.546 --> 20:48.913
Are they sending
another ambulance?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.748
Yeah, from cobourg.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.483
That's two hours away.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.685
Hey.
Diane?

20:54.687 --> 20:57.588
Diane?
What's going on?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.357
Her shock is getting worse.

21:01.493 --> 21:05.396
And... Abracadabra.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.331
An antibiotic nail.
That's right.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.333
Now it sounds like
exactly what it is.

21:09.335 --> 21:10.835
We hammer this
into the tibial canal,

21:10.837 --> 21:12.003
It stabilizes the fracture

21:12.005 --> 21:13.804
And fights the infection
at the same time.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.339
Neat.

21:15.341 --> 21:17.875
Now clean this up
and expose the screw holes.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.310
Got it.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.344
Hey, is this your pal
with the, uh,

21:20.346 --> 21:23.581
Iron maiden on his leg?

21:23.583 --> 21:25.016
Yeah, word travels fast, huh?

21:25.018 --> 21:27.551
Oh, my god.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.020
What the hell happened
to him?

21:29.022 --> 21:31.422
Bit of a long story, dana.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.923
Well, you want me to put
a free flap on <i>that?</i>

21:32.925 --> 21:34.592
That is the plan, dana,
yep.

21:34.594 --> 21:37.061
I wished you'd called
before I came down,

21:37.063 --> 21:38.429
'cause there's no way.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.964
Well, I can't just
leave it exposed.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.465
Yeah, but to put in
a free flap,

21:41.467 --> 21:42.967
I have to borrow muscle
from the other leg,

21:42.969 --> 21:44.502
Leaving a big hole.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.903
And then, say the flap
doesn't take, gets infected.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.705
Now the guy's got
two bad legs.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.040
Or it goes the other way.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.742
And the healthy muscle
helps mobilize the antibiotics,

21:51.744 --> 21:54.945
And helps fight
the infection better. Mallet.

21:54.947 --> 21:58.416
(clanking)

21:59.451 --> 22:02.320
Jesus, charlie.
The leg's a goner.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.554
Cut it off!

22:03.556 --> 22:08.025
(sighs) anybody else
smell smoke?

22:21.373 --> 22:22.473
(dana) charlie,
you have to amputate. Face it.

22:22.475 --> 22:26.377
Dana, I know the patient,
and we have to try.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.045
You want me to cut a piece
off his good leg

22:28.047 --> 22:29.647
And sew it
onto the bad leg.

22:29.649 --> 22:32.616
You're just prolonging
his suffering.

22:32.618 --> 22:36.387
It's kind of his thing.
If you go down this road,

22:36.389 --> 22:39.090
There's no turning back.
You're committed.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.392
So no more bikini contests.
He'll get over that.

22:41.394 --> 22:43.794
Dana, every major decision
I've made in my life,

22:43.796 --> 22:45.062
I've asked this guy's advice.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.931
He's like a brother to me.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.833
I owe him this. So...

22:48.835 --> 22:51.068
Help me.

22:51.070 --> 22:54.939
(monitors beeping)

22:54.941 --> 22:58.476
(sighs) all right.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.945
Thank you.

23:00.947 --> 23:04.548
Put in the locking screws
and dress the wound.
Mm-hmm.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.450
(glove snaps)

23:14.793 --> 23:16.527
Her pulse is 130.

23:17.829 --> 23:21.098
And she's unconscious.
She must still be
bleeding out.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.768
Check it.
(whispers)
yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:26.104 --> 23:28.172
(normal voice) no.
The tamponade is still holding,

23:28.174 --> 23:29.640
But she's lost
a lot of blood.

23:29.642 --> 23:30.841
There's at least
2 liters on the floor here.

23:30.843 --> 23:31.909
Yeah, she needs fluids.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.043
She needs blood.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.779
Yeah, she does.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.981
I'm o-negative.
Universal donor.
And she can have my blood.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.817
I-I can--just give us a second
while we figure this out, jack.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.685
No, why don't you stop talking
and do something?

23:41.687 --> 23:43.120
Okay, we will
do something about it, jack.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.655
Just--why don't you just
hold your wife's hand

23:44.657 --> 23:47.858
For--for a second while
I talk to dr. Reid?

23:50.962 --> 23:53.664
Alex, are you seriously talking
about doing a live transfusion?

23:53.666 --> 23:55.065
It could save her life.
Yeah, or not.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.434
Either way, you are
out of your mind.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.568
Well, she's gonna die

23:57.570 --> 23:58.936
If she doesn't get
some fluids in her.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.738
And a root beer out of
the fridge isn't gonna do it.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.473
Okay, you're talking about
cutting into your wrist,

24:02.475 --> 24:04.475
Okay, the cephalic vein.
Now you are a surgeon.

24:04.477 --> 24:05.509
Okay,
you're a magnificent surgeon.

24:05.511 --> 24:06.744
Your hands are your life.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.045
Aren't we supposed
to help people, joel?

24:08.047 --> 24:09.513
Isn't that why
we're surgeons?

24:09.515 --> 24:11.115
But if you cut a tendon,
or if you cut an artery,

24:11.117 --> 24:12.650
You might not be able
to operate again.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.186
Well, I won't,
if I'm such a good surgeon.

24:15.188 --> 24:16.887
Now I need something
that I can use as a needle.

24:16.889 --> 24:20.624
Alex, I'm telling you,
this is a terrible idea.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.526
I know it is.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.128
So help me.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.167
(groans)

24:30.169 --> 24:32.036
Would you like me
to turn this tv on?

24:32.038 --> 24:33.737
(strained voice) no.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.141
I can get a volunteer

24:37.143 --> 24:38.542
To come in and get you
some juice, maybe a magazine--

24:38.544 --> 24:40.878
Is it just me,
or are you talking...

24:40.880 --> 24:42.046
Really loud?

24:42.048 --> 24:43.647
It's quite normal
after brain surgery

24:43.649 --> 24:46.517
For things to seem
very noisy and bright.

24:46.519 --> 24:49.086
(monitor beeping steadily)

24:49.088 --> 24:52.590
(telephone ringing in distance)

24:56.161 --> 24:57.962
How are you feeling?

24:57.964 --> 25:00.064
Terrible.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.132
I hear you saying,
"you feel terrible."

25:02.134 --> 25:03.534
I feel like somebody just...

25:03.536 --> 25:05.202
Banged my head
against the ground.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.738
Mm-hmm. I hear you saying,
"you feel like somebody

25:07.740 --> 25:10.674
Has banged your head
against the--"
(sighs) stop.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.277
Dr. Hamza. I--

25:13.279 --> 25:15.079
I complained about
your bedside manner

25:15.081 --> 25:16.580
Because you seemed
completely unaware

25:16.582 --> 25:18.215
That I was a human being...

25:18.217 --> 25:20.951
With feelings.
But this is...

25:20.953 --> 25:22.586
This is worse.

25:22.588 --> 25:25.089
I just--I just
don't know how to be.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.825
Just be yourself.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.228
Well, I have very bad news.

25:31.230 --> 25:35.866
The surgery didn't go
as well as I'd hoped.

25:35.868 --> 25:39.703
We weren't able to remove
all of the tumor.

25:44.676 --> 25:48.012
And I just find people
so confusing sometimes.

25:48.014 --> 25:51.649
I get it.
(whispers) I get it.

25:56.621 --> 25:58.989
Tell me about your humming.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.792
I-I've heard you humming.

26:01.794 --> 26:05.696
What? This?

26:05.698 --> 26:08.766
(humming)

26:12.137 --> 26:14.138
Hmm.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.974
"gymnopÃ©die no. 1"
by erik satie.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.843
I've always preferred mozart.
More notes.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.245
My life's work so far

26:21.247 --> 26:23.914
Has been recording
all of satie's piano pieces,

26:23.916 --> 26:25.983
But...

26:25.985 --> 26:28.752
I don't think I'm going
to get around to this one.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.789
You may. Hmm?

26:35.060 --> 26:36.927
You have a month.

26:36.929 --> 26:40.631
(exhales deeply)

26:43.635 --> 26:45.269
I, um...

26:47.372 --> 26:48.739
(voice breaking) I think
I'm gonna close my eyes

26:48.741 --> 26:50.975
For a moment,
if you don't mind.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.656
(clicks)
hey, man...

27:05.658 --> 27:07.291
You can't smoke in here.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.326
(clicks)
dude, I'm a ghost.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.395
Well, I...
Heard your real lungs.

27:11.397 --> 27:14.732
So... Just do me a favor.
Don't.

27:14.734 --> 27:18.402
(sighs)

27:19.971 --> 27:21.338
Lay it on me.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.874
What?
The...

27:23.876 --> 27:26.810
Come on, man. You've been
telling me what to do

27:26.812 --> 27:28.679
Since we were, what,
19 years old?

27:28.681 --> 27:32.082
So, what do I do about...

27:32.084 --> 27:34.184
This?
What, seeing ghosts?

27:34.186 --> 27:36.954
Yeah.
You might have finally
stumped me, charles.

27:36.956 --> 27:40.224
(chuckles)
kinda being serious
this time.

27:40.226 --> 27:43.160
I could use some help.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.862
Okay, look. I don't, uh...

27:44.864 --> 27:46.797
I don't know
what's happening here.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.332
But, uh...

27:48.334 --> 27:50.334
It is mind-blowingly cool,
charlie.

27:50.336 --> 27:54.204
So my advice--
my advice is to embrace it.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.706
Use it.
How?

27:55.708 --> 27:57.107
I don't know.
I don't know.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.342
If it was me...

27:58.344 --> 28:01.011
Rwanda, kosovo, sierra leone.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.815
Kids and mothers
being murdered coldheartedly.

28:04.817 --> 28:08.118
You talk to the spirits,
you find out what happened.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.286
You get names, ranks.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.321
You see what I'm saying here,
charlie?

28:11.323 --> 28:12.456
The wrongs that
you could make right.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.958
This--this--this is...

28:14.960 --> 28:16.460
Huge, man.

28:17.462 --> 28:18.829
I'll think about it.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.264
No. Unh-unh.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.232
That means no.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.801
Say yes.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.770
Thomas...

28:26.772 --> 28:29.206
Boom! Yes!
Me and you kickin' ass!

28:29.208 --> 28:32.743
(pager buzzes)
ah, I love this.
You're gonna love this.

28:32.745 --> 28:35.713
Oh, look. I have to get back
to your surgery.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.114
Mm.

28:43.022 --> 28:47.424
I will do the saphenous cut-down
on diane's ankle.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.859
And then I'll cut myself.
We need to make sure

28:48.861 --> 28:50.294
She doesn't get
an air embolism.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.763
And I'll wait to cannulate
until the tube's been primed.

28:52.765 --> 28:54.965
Perfect. Once it has...
Drip, drip, drip.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.066
Yeah.

28:57.368 --> 28:59.169
You know,

28:59.171 --> 29:00.437
She could reject your blood.

29:00.439 --> 29:03.006
We'll know within
the first few minutes.

29:03.008 --> 29:06.376
Or she'll bleed out and die
15 minutes from now.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.911
Yeah.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.147
Let's do it.

29:21.192 --> 29:22.493
Yep.

29:25.296 --> 29:26.797
(knife clatters)

29:27.899 --> 29:30.434
Here we go.

29:35.206 --> 29:36.373
(knife clatters)

29:36.375 --> 29:37.374
You're both gonna
go septic from this,

29:37.376 --> 29:38.942
You know that, right?

29:38.944 --> 29:40.911
Sterility in trauma
is a luxury.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.513
Besides...

29:42.515 --> 29:45.549
That ambulance is
just a few minutes away.

29:57.228 --> 29:58.228
(gasps)

29:58.230 --> 30:00.030
(knife thuds)

30:00.032 --> 30:04.034
(exhales sharply
and groans)
okay.

30:14.179 --> 30:16.113
We've got some flow.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.848
(objects clatter)
yes.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.817
Okay.

30:21.853 --> 30:24.454
And tube's primed.
(object clatters)

30:34.098 --> 30:35.199
(tape rips)

30:36.501 --> 30:38.602
How about I count down
two minutes?

30:38.604 --> 30:42.139
If she makes it through this,
we're gold.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.078
(exhales)

30:51.282 --> 30:54.184
Okay. She seems stable.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.086
You know, this is more fun

30:56.088 --> 30:58.889
Than giving my presentation
on diaphragmatic repair.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.290
Well, it's a little bit
more interesting.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.625
Just saying.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.527
What, that I'm not
a scintillating public speaker?

31:03.529 --> 31:05.629
You kind of have
this, uh...

31:05.631 --> 31:07.464
It's like
this adorable clumsiness

31:07.466 --> 31:09.099
Whenever you get nervous.

31:09.101 --> 31:10.567
And... Time.

31:13.571 --> 31:15.172
(alex) it's working.

31:15.174 --> 31:16.273
Is she gonna be okay?

31:16.275 --> 31:19.276
She's hanging in there, jack.

31:19.278 --> 31:20.344
(crying)

31:20.346 --> 31:21.411
Okay?

31:21.413 --> 31:22.880
(voice breaks) yeah.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.017
Okay. The minute that pulse
hits 100,

31:27.019 --> 31:29.152
I'm gonna take
that tube out of you.

31:29.154 --> 31:31.188
Then, young lady, we're gonna
find you a juice

31:31.190 --> 31:33.056
And a delicious cookie.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.925
Yes, sir.

31:36.394 --> 31:39.630
(siren wailing in distance)

31:42.533 --> 31:45.168
Hey.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.403
Shouldn't you be at home?

31:46.405 --> 31:48.071
I can't.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.673
I feel...

31:49.675 --> 31:52.976
(sighs) something.

31:52.978 --> 31:54.211
What are you
still doing here?

31:54.213 --> 31:56.346
I'm waiting for maggie
to get out of surgery.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.582
Right.

32:00.485 --> 32:03.320
So, things go badly
with your patient?

32:03.322 --> 32:05.022
Yes.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.396
Ever since victor and I
broke up,

32:12.398 --> 32:13.430
I haven't replaced him.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.365
It's okay to be single.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.334
No. I mean...

32:17.336 --> 32:21.271
Look, I get a lot of
sexual "sugar," like you say.

32:22.373 --> 32:24.241
I just haven't found...

32:24.243 --> 32:25.676
I haven't found love.

32:25.678 --> 32:28.578
As stifling as love is.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.617
But you're happy.
Doesn't matter.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.986
My point is,
my patient today told me,

32:35.988 --> 32:38.055
You know,
just to be myself.

32:41.359 --> 32:44.294
So what if that means
I can never be close to people?

32:44.296 --> 32:45.629
Hmm?

32:48.399 --> 32:51.468
Uh... Eh...
Sit... Further away.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.669
(inhales, exhales)

32:52.671 --> 32:57.374
Shahir, love and closeness
are feelings,

32:57.376 --> 32:59.476
But they consist
of gestures.

32:59.478 --> 33:03.180
What we do
matters the most.

33:03.182 --> 33:06.149
So then why bother
with your stupid exercises?

33:06.151 --> 33:07.985
Hmm?

33:07.987 --> 33:09.319
Hey.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.488
Hey. How was the surgery?

33:11.490 --> 33:14.091
Maggots. Bullets.
Rotting flesh.

33:14.093 --> 33:17.594
It was, uh,
it was amazing.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.696
Do you own anything camo?

33:19.698 --> 33:21.264
I have some green socks.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.265
Hmm.

33:22.267 --> 33:23.567
I want you to put them on

33:23.569 --> 33:26.069
And tell me about
how much you hate war.

33:26.071 --> 33:27.404
I actually do hate war.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.072
That's great. Um...

33:29.074 --> 33:31.641
But say it like you have
a bullet in your leg.

33:32.710 --> 33:36.480
Aah! I hate war!

33:36.482 --> 33:38.348
Yeah. I can
work with that.

33:40.151 --> 33:43.620
Uh... So--so the socks
are your gesture?

33:43.622 --> 33:45.689
In this case, yeah.

33:48.092 --> 33:50.193
(dana) nice work, everyone.

33:53.331 --> 33:55.799
Well, looks like
you made the right call.

33:55.801 --> 33:58.602
I think that flap's
gonna take.

33:58.604 --> 33:59.603
(fist thuds)

33:59.605 --> 34:01.038
Thank you, dana.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.341
Sure.

34:04.343 --> 34:07.144
(cell phone vibrates)

34:07.146 --> 34:08.278
Mm.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.781
Charlie harris.

34:10.783 --> 34:12.749
Okay.
Well, I think you've made--

34:12.751 --> 34:16.353
I think you've made
a mistake, but...

34:16.355 --> 34:18.622
Thank you.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.123
Everything okay?

34:20.125 --> 34:24.394
It appears that, uh,
thomas ford is not insured.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.496
Ooh. Too much time
out of the country, huh?

34:26.498 --> 34:28.698
Yeah, that,
and he's unemployed.

34:28.700 --> 34:29.766
I thought he got hurt
on assignment.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.769
Me, too.
Ah.

34:33.671 --> 34:37.541
How you feeling?

34:37.543 --> 34:40.177
Little woozy, to be honest.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.347
Pulse is 95.
I'm calling it, okay?

34:44.349 --> 34:45.849
Mm.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.342
Why don't you get some rest?
I got this.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.511
Sounds good.

35:28.826 --> 35:31.428
(inhales, exhales)

35:31.430 --> 35:32.696
Oh, pain bite.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.397
(exhales)

35:34.399 --> 35:36.833
Pain.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.769
Morphine pump.
Squeeze.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.438
You big baby.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.673
(telephone ringing in distance,
monitor beeping steadily)

35:43.675 --> 35:45.175
(beeps)

35:45.177 --> 35:47.377
You know, you're welcome
for saving your leg.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.913
Thank you.

35:52.216 --> 35:55.318
You know if you're in trouble,
I can help you, right?

35:55.320 --> 35:58.455
You know, huh?

35:58.457 --> 36:00.590
Yep.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.791
Yeah, I called
the magazine,

36:01.793 --> 36:04.394
And they told me
they... Fired you.

36:04.396 --> 36:05.595
What happened?

36:05.597 --> 36:08.598
(exhales) it's nothing.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.233
It was time to move on.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.736
The whole thing
was blown out of proportion.

36:12.738 --> 36:13.737
Was it drugs?

36:13.739 --> 36:16.606
Come on, man.

36:16.608 --> 36:17.941
(laughs)

36:17.943 --> 36:20.343
Then... What?

36:22.580 --> 36:25.649
Two guys were about to set
another guy on fire.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.885
I told them to
"stop, don't do this."

36:28.887 --> 36:30.887
They laughed.

36:32.890 --> 36:35.425
So I shot one of them.

36:35.427 --> 36:38.962
Well... You got
a shot at what?

36:38.964 --> 36:44.868
I shot a man.
I killed him.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.239
Jesus, ford.

36:49.241 --> 36:52.976
I've seen hundreds
of people killed.

36:52.978 --> 36:56.546
They always come up to me,
you know, as they're dying.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.315
"help me."

36:58.317 --> 37:03.853
And I take a step back,
get the picture.

37:03.855 --> 37:07.324
I'm half-in, I'm half-out.
I...

37:08.659 --> 37:10.827
I finally had to
pick a side.

37:10.829 --> 37:15.899
Anyway, I'm freelancing now.
It's better.

37:15.901 --> 37:19.803
You should
come with me, charles.

37:19.805 --> 37:23.506
You ever seen angola? Huh?

37:25.810 --> 37:27.978
Next time, huh?

37:27.980 --> 37:30.480
(chuckles) yeah. Right.

37:33.951 --> 37:36.353
Hey, uh, grab my camera
in there, will ya?

37:44.795 --> 37:47.964
Thanks.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.766
(beeps)

37:49.768 --> 37:50.834
Get over here.

37:50.836 --> 37:51.968
No.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.371
Come on.
Get your ugly mug over here.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.507
Say "cheese."

37:57.509 --> 37:59.309
Cheese.

37:59.311 --> 38:00.944
(beeps, shutter clicks)

38:02.947 --> 38:04.781
(laughs)

38:04.783 --> 38:07.751
Dude, you look like
a ghost, man.

38:07.753 --> 38:08.985
(beeps)

38:13.724 --> 38:18.295
(humming)

38:18.297 --> 38:20.597
You got some more bad news
for me, doctor?

38:20.599 --> 38:24.968
Actually, I'm going
to do something for you.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.336
For me?

38:26.338 --> 38:28.838
More for me. Either way.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.508
Now, let's get you
out of this.

38:31.510 --> 38:35.011
Wow, you are really
hooked up here, aren't you?

38:35.013 --> 38:36.379
Let's call a nurse.

38:36.381 --> 38:37.881
Nurse!

38:37.883 --> 38:41.318
(indistinct conversations)

38:42.753 --> 38:45.755
Okay, so I know you're probably
used to steinways,

38:45.757 --> 38:49.626
But this is
the best I could do.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.928
I don't really feel up
for a concert.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.097
No, I'm gonna play
for you.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.732
(clears throat)

38:55.734 --> 38:57.500
You don't have to do this.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.036
You know, my mother made me
take lessons when I was a kid.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.504
At first, I thought
it was a curse,

39:01.506 --> 39:04.641
It was kind of a respite
from talking to patients.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.577
Okay.
So I have to warn you,

39:07.579 --> 39:09.379
I'm, uh, really...

39:09.381 --> 39:10.914
Really rusty. Hmm.

39:10.916 --> 39:14.351
(playing
satie's "gymnopÃ©dies-no. 1")

39:47.084 --> 39:50.520
â™ª

40:16.781 --> 40:19.783
(siren wailing in distance)

40:19.785 --> 40:29.893
â™ª

40:29.895 --> 40:42.439
â™ª

41:18.676 --> 41:21.144
Okay. So?

41:21.146 --> 41:22.645
How was it?

41:22.647 --> 41:24.047
Truth?
Hmm?

41:24.049 --> 41:26.182
It was, um...

41:26.184 --> 41:27.917
It was pretty bad.

41:27.919 --> 41:31.521
But it was also, um...

41:31.523 --> 41:35.825
(voice breaking)
it was also pretty great.

41:35.827 --> 41:39.562
Thank you.

41:39.564 --> 41:42.599
I'm officially
withdrawing my complaint.

41:43.267 --> 41:45.168
(whispers) thank you.

41:48.939 --> 41:50.273
Thank you.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.946
Yeah, I still think you
should let the e.R. Docs

41:56.948 --> 41:58.681
Keep you overnight.
Hell, no.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.216
That was the purest
I've felt in a long time.

42:00.218 --> 42:01.584
You know, just acting
on instinct.

42:01.586 --> 42:04.587
Not thinking, just doing.

42:04.589 --> 42:05.255
Yep.

42:05.257 --> 42:07.223
We made a good team.

42:10.094 --> 42:12.095
This is me.

42:12.097 --> 42:15.665
Yes. It is.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.000
Oh, hey.

42:17.002 --> 42:18.902
Yeah?

42:20.204 --> 42:23.306
Uh, you should probably...

42:24.608 --> 42:26.876
You should probably
change the, uh, bandages

42:26.878 --> 42:29.846
Before you go to bed.

42:29.848 --> 42:35.218
Just... I don't want
the hand getting infected.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.320
Right. Thanks.

42:41.158 --> 42:42.659
(beep, lock clicks)

42:43.894 --> 42:46.195
(switch clicks)

42:48.732 --> 42:50.300
(sighs)

42:58.042 --> 43:00.209
(exhales deeply)

43:02.246 --> 43:05.248
(exhales deeply)
