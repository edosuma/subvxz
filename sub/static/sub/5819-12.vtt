WEBVTT

00:01.215 --> 00:02.699
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.729 --> 00:05.025
Freya: If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:05.055 --> 00:07.477
you will all fall: One by friend,

00:07.507 --> 00:10.375
one by foe, and one by family.

00:10.377 --> 00:12.427
And as you rot in the ocean,

00:12.429 --> 00:14.713
remember my face, Tristan,

00:14.715 --> 00:17.432
'cause it's gonna be the
last one that you ever see.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.393
Aya: Tristan de Martel

00:18.423 --> 00:20.504
guided this organization for centuries.

00:20.534 --> 00:23.034
I will not allow that defeat
to hamper our cause.

00:23.452 --> 00:25.425
Those dark objects are my family's legacy.

00:25.455 --> 00:26.517
Give them back

00:26.547 --> 00:27.906
or I will take them back

00:27.936 --> 00:30.097
and I swear you will regret this moment.

00:30.127 --> 00:32.293
The only thing I regret
is failing to realize

00:32.295 --> 00:34.095
how far you've spun out of control!

00:34.097 --> 00:36.131
Somewhere out there is an elusive weapon

00:36.133 --> 00:37.799
capable of killing an Original.

00:37.801 --> 00:40.190
I'm calling to suggest
we pool our efforts to find it.

00:40.220 --> 00:42.137
Ariane. Come forward, please.

00:42.139 --> 00:43.505
And what do you want from me?

00:43.507 --> 00:45.340
Ariane: Water will act as a conductor,

00:45.342 --> 00:47.676
allowing me to enter your mind.

00:47.678 --> 00:49.477
Did you see it? The weapon?

00:49.479 --> 00:51.680
An unending darkness lies before you.

00:51.682 --> 00:52.681
A pale horse.

00:52.683 --> 00:55.183
I am released.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.335
There is only one other person

00:56.365 --> 00:58.200
capable of deciphering the witch's riddle.

00:58.230 --> 00:59.857
The very person with whom I shared

00:59.887 --> 01:02.742
my memories of that night:
My trusted therapist.

01:02.772 --> 01:04.431
The horse was made of the white oak.

01:04.461 --> 01:07.379
That weapon is here.

01:09.216 --> 01:12.789
- (Chanting quietly)
- (Footsteps approaching)

01:12.819 --> 01:14.369
How's it going in here?

01:14.399 --> 01:15.708
We're cloaked.

01:16.611 --> 01:17.822
For now.

01:17.968 --> 01:19.779
But I can sense somebody's
searching for you,

01:19.809 --> 01:21.559
and my guess is it's Freya Mikaelson.

01:22.377 --> 01:24.289
I guess that's what happens
when you steal the one thing

01:24.319 --> 01:25.846
that can kill her entire family.

01:25.876 --> 01:27.870
I wouldn't have taken it
if Klaus hadn't confiscated

01:27.900 --> 01:29.886
my dark objects, so
technically this is his fault.

01:29.916 --> 01:31.670
You try explaining that to him.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.211
I have it all worked out...

01:33.241 --> 01:36.057
You put up a boundary spell
Klaus can't enter.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.343
If he wants what's his, he'll
give me back what's mine.

01:38.345 --> 01:40.967
Those dark objects were
made by New Orleans witches.

01:40.997 --> 01:42.815
I want 'em back just as much as you do.

01:42.845 --> 01:44.788
Good. Then I chose the right partner.

01:44.818 --> 01:47.399
Cami, you got to see the mess you're in.

01:47.429 --> 01:49.559
You jacked the one weapon

01:49.589 --> 01:53.007
that can kill the most powerful
vampires in the world.

01:54.123 --> 01:55.298
You got a target on your back.

01:55.328 --> 01:57.284
- Klaus wouldn't hurt me.
- Klaus ain't the only one that's gonna

01:57.314 --> 01:59.486
- come looking for the white oak.
- Then let's get this over with.

02:00.265 --> 02:01.356
Cami: Vincent!

02:02.936 --> 02:05.327
I'm sick of playing at a disadvantage.

02:05.939 --> 02:07.438
It's what got me killed.

02:09.862 --> 02:11.964
I'm going to take your silence
as a resounding agreement

02:11.994 --> 02:13.695
with my very reasonable plan.

02:13.697 --> 02:16.556
- Now all I have to do is invite Klaus.
- Cami,

02:16.586 --> 02:19.033
are you sure you want to do this?

02:20.576 --> 02:22.184
(Phone whooshes)

== corrections & sync by Wolfhound ==
== www.addic7ed.com ==

02:31.342 --> 02:33.254
What happened to her?

02:33.334 --> 02:34.688
This is what befalls anyone

02:34.718 --> 02:36.634
who bargains with Elijah Mikaelson.

02:36.636 --> 02:39.538
Ariane discovered the weapon
that could kill an Original.

02:39.568 --> 02:41.389
And since Elijah would never allow anyone

02:41.391 --> 02:43.224
to posses so deadly a secret...

02:45.857 --> 02:47.057
He killed her.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.531
She was nice to me.

02:50.533 --> 02:52.072
Then perhaps you won't mind spending

02:52.102 --> 02:54.135
a little more time together.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:05.410 --> 03:07.919
You and the others will channel her,

03:07.949 --> 03:10.318
search her mind and find the weapon.

03:11.187 --> 03:13.859
Davina: It's a little disrespectful
to the dead, don't you think?

03:14.257 --> 03:16.908
Not to mention dangerous.

03:16.938 --> 03:18.141
If Elijah finds out...

03:18.171 --> 03:20.992
I know better than you how
dangerous Elijah can be.

03:21.022 --> 03:23.817
And yet, as he is my sire, my life

03:23.847 --> 03:26.501
and the lives of the Strix are tied to his.

03:28.349 --> 03:29.349
So...

03:31.758 --> 03:33.312
I will not rest

03:33.844 --> 03:36.511
until that weapon is found.

03:40.858 --> 03:42.734
So that's how it is.

03:44.919 --> 03:46.102
You recruit a witch from my city

03:46.132 --> 03:47.138
and you don't even tell me.

03:47.140 --> 03:49.173
I'm not in the habit of
explaining my decisions

03:49.175 --> 03:50.475
to subordinates.

03:50.792 --> 03:52.393
She's just a kid.

03:53.461 --> 03:55.474
Davina Claire is a former regent.

03:55.504 --> 03:58.203
A shame she aligned with
us only after her shunning.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.958
But then, some things are
beyond even my control.

04:02.187 --> 04:03.187
Hey...

04:03.655 --> 04:06.024
I'm not gonna let her be your puppet.

04:08.247 --> 04:10.862
You are in no position to make demands.

04:11.091 --> 04:13.197
If the prophecy is true,
the Mikaelsons will fall

04:13.199 --> 04:15.210
within the year and us along with them.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.709
I have a plan that will keep us alive.

04:18.372 --> 04:22.222
Perhaps you should focus on proving
yourself essential to my plan.

04:32.677 --> 04:34.319
Ah. Vincent.

04:34.497 --> 04:37.277
I should have known Camille
would seek powerful fools

04:37.307 --> 04:39.685
to aid in this rather futile gambit.

04:39.966 --> 04:41.938
As I send you off to join your ancestors,

04:41.968 --> 04:43.885
just know this is her fault.

04:48.137 --> 04:50.858
I was hoping for a simple trade,

04:50.860 --> 04:52.060
but seeing as how everything you took

04:52.062 --> 04:53.561
can't possibly fit in that briefcase,

04:53.563 --> 04:54.690
I'm gonna go ahead and assume

04:54.720 --> 04:56.697
that "simple" ain't exactly
your style, huh?

04:56.699 --> 04:58.792
Why don't you take down this barrier?

04:59.062 --> 05:02.180
I'll show you precisely
what my style entails.

05:02.210 --> 05:03.372
Seriously?

05:04.547 --> 05:05.804
I have an ancient,

05:05.834 --> 05:08.829
mystical weapon of doom,
and instead of agreeing

05:08.859 --> 05:11.081
to my very fair trade,
you're making threats.

05:11.463 --> 05:12.719
There she is.

05:13.117 --> 05:14.332
Traitor to my family,

05:14.334 --> 05:17.163
- thief of that which is mine.
- Don't be dramatic.

05:17.193 --> 05:18.886
Like I said, I just wanted your attention.

05:18.888 --> 05:20.844
And seeing as you're
here, I'd say I got it.

05:20.874 --> 05:23.207
Yes, a rather effective tactic.

05:23.381 --> 05:25.079
One I usually reserve for enemies,

05:25.109 --> 05:27.045
and here I thought we were intimates.

05:28.399 --> 05:29.881
We are.

05:30.519 --> 05:33.618
But relationships are built
on trust and equality,

05:33.620 --> 05:36.387
and we don't have either
if you're confiscating my stuff.

05:36.389 --> 05:38.356
And so your response
is to steal what's mine

05:38.358 --> 05:40.547
in an attempt to bend my will to your own.

05:40.577 --> 05:42.744
I just want back what you took.

05:49.291 --> 05:51.272
What, that's, like, a third of them?

05:51.508 --> 05:52.734
So would you like a third

05:52.764 --> 05:55.206
- of the white oak?
- Are you really gonna do this?

05:55.208 --> 05:58.226
Okay, listen, I'm gonna leave
you two lovebirds alone, but,

05:58.256 --> 05:59.472
uh, y'all want my advice,

05:59.502 --> 06:00.601
y'all best to finish this up

06:00.631 --> 06:02.881
before someone finds out what she took.

06:16.072 --> 06:17.979
Hayley: Okay, so what's the plan?

06:18.144 --> 06:20.226
Cami's out there with the white oak
and I'm not gonna lose

06:20.256 --> 06:21.905
one more person that I care about.

06:21.935 --> 06:23.690
Niklaus can handle Camille. Till then,

06:23.720 --> 06:25.225
I'll keep Aya distracted.

06:25.255 --> 06:26.604
Why don't you just kill her?

06:29.178 --> 06:30.752
She and I have history.

06:33.066 --> 06:34.663
You two had a thing?

06:40.686 --> 06:42.409
Aya was a towering intellect

06:42.439 --> 06:45.077
with an insatiable curiosity.

06:45.436 --> 06:47.691
Passionate, fearless

06:48.129 --> 06:51.028
and something of an outcast.

06:58.003 --> 07:00.150
Long ago, I invited her...

07:00.180 --> 07:02.905
to join a rather elite company.

07:02.935 --> 07:04.964
I determined she was perfectly tailored

07:04.994 --> 07:07.894
to bear the responsibility
of an immortal life.

07:08.998 --> 07:10.586
I made her like me.

07:10.616 --> 07:13.667
She was one of the first Strix.

07:14.473 --> 07:16.573
We cared for one another deeply.

07:20.726 --> 07:22.791
Together we created

07:22.821 --> 07:25.763
a fellowship unburdened

07:25.793 --> 07:26.986
by the limitations of man.

07:27.016 --> 07:29.158
It was the pursuit

07:29.188 --> 07:31.237
of a glorious new world.

07:33.976 --> 07:36.045
And then father...

07:38.233 --> 07:40.555
Led by that unquenchable desire

07:40.585 --> 07:43.114
to slay his children, Mikael descended,

07:43.144 --> 07:45.320
accompanied by a small
army. He laid to waste

07:45.350 --> 07:46.568
everything that I built.

07:46.598 --> 07:50.104
So... we had no choice but to run.

07:51.932 --> 07:53.082
Come with me.

07:54.813 --> 07:56.106
Aya did not.

07:58.918 --> 08:02.533
So when Tristan found her, he rescued her.

08:02.535 --> 08:05.321
She, of course, came to see
him as something of a savior.

08:05.622 --> 08:07.616
And in time, beneath
his corrupted guidance,

08:07.646 --> 08:09.012
they made the Strix what they are today...

08:09.042 --> 08:13.432
a hive of depraved and ignorant savages.

08:16.547 --> 08:18.436
And she's never forgiven me.

08:26.885 --> 08:29.607
I'm not entirely certain
I've ever forgiven myself.

08:32.826 --> 08:33.826
Well...

08:35.952 --> 08:38.364
Given all that,

08:38.394 --> 08:41.914
how exactly do you plan
on keeping her distracted?

08:42.075 --> 08:44.075
With a little salt...

08:45.078 --> 08:47.245
In an old wound.

08:56.126 --> 08:58.398
(Chanting)

09:05.919 --> 09:07.363
We're getting nowhere.

09:07.393 --> 09:08.909
Take some time, gather your focus.

09:08.911 --> 09:11.763
We'll reconvene in an hour.
And we won't stop

09:11.793 --> 09:13.593
until we get what we need.

09:29.971 --> 09:32.371
I know you're not a New Orleans witch.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.213
But you did die here.

09:34.243 --> 09:36.561
When I was a little girl
I remember being told

09:36.591 --> 09:37.984
that a witch who wasn't consecrated

09:38.014 --> 09:39.847
would never know peace.

09:41.018 --> 09:42.924
The ancestors may hate me,

09:43.554 --> 09:46.403
but at the end of the day,
witches take care of their own.

09:52.874 --> 09:54.066
... Trinket I made

09:54.096 --> 09:56.879
when we were children. A toy.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.555
Ariane: You found it, which means

09:59.585 --> 10:01.690
you've come to kill me.

10:07.985 --> 10:09.571
Cami: I think you need to calm down,

10:09.601 --> 10:11.929
count to ten, focus on your breathing.

10:12.456 --> 10:14.431
Is this amusing to you?

10:14.675 --> 10:16.233
Endangering my family?

10:16.263 --> 10:18.635
Am I laughing? I want to
put this all behind us.

10:18.637 --> 10:21.722
You of all people know what
I am capable of, and yet you seem

10:21.724 --> 10:23.924
determined to incur my wrath.

10:23.926 --> 10:25.545
I'm gonna ask you one last time...

10:25.575 --> 10:27.275
"Give me the white oak."

10:27.596 --> 10:28.646
Am I right?

10:29.565 --> 10:31.662
My answer is, happily, as soon as you stop

10:31.692 --> 10:33.664
screwing around and
give me back what's mine.

10:33.694 --> 10:35.352
If I give your trinkets back,

10:35.354 --> 10:37.707
I embolden all manner of foolishness.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.245
You will grow arrogant

10:39.275 --> 10:40.796
under the false belief you have power

10:40.826 --> 10:43.077
and ultimately you will end up dead.

10:43.079 --> 10:44.588
(Scoffs)

10:45.826 --> 10:47.119
Klaus, you're afraid something

10:47.149 --> 10:48.549
will happen to me?

10:48.579 --> 10:50.779
Guess what, something already did.

10:51.295 --> 10:54.357
Your ex hates me so much, she murdered me.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.988
She's gonna have to pay for that.

10:57.018 --> 10:59.151
And since I can't fight
her fair and square,

10:59.181 --> 11:01.124
I need those dark objects.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.492
Fine.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.375
I'll retrieve your toys.

11:13.375 --> 11:17.165
Keep this bloody barrier up till I return.

11:41.452 --> 11:43.463
My witches have made a discovery.

11:43.493 --> 11:46.869
Whatever it was, Elijah clearly
wants it to remain hidden.

11:46.899 --> 11:48.509
We can only assume a weapon is in play

11:48.511 --> 11:51.066
and that all our lives are at risk.

11:51.268 --> 11:53.063
We will not rest

11:53.093 --> 11:55.543
until that weapon is under our control.

11:55.987 --> 11:57.348
Hello, everyone.

12:00.573 --> 12:03.274
Wonderful to see you all.

12:03.547 --> 12:07.009
Aya, don't we look so
very comfortable indeed

12:07.039 --> 12:09.624
leading Tristan's little circus.

12:09.985 --> 12:12.713
Sadly, one does not simply ascend
to the position of leader.

12:12.743 --> 12:14.301
Kind of has to be by my consent.

12:14.645 --> 12:15.969
You see, I am

12:15.971 --> 12:17.987
the maker, the creator,

12:18.017 --> 12:19.890
the founding father.

12:20.404 --> 12:22.276
I am the one who chooses the leader here,

12:22.278 --> 12:25.683
and fortunately for every last one of you,

12:25.713 --> 12:28.470
I have an excellent candidate in mind.

12:28.785 --> 12:31.154
See, today is the day

12:31.184 --> 12:33.954
I take back what is mine.

12:34.690 --> 12:36.640
Do I hear any objections?

12:39.007 --> 12:40.041
So ladies and gentlemen,

12:40.071 --> 12:42.947
the offer I extend to you is simple enough.

12:42.977 --> 12:47.367
You follow me, I shall
return you all to greatness.

12:47.659 --> 12:49.954
You're really just gonna come
in here and start making demands?

12:49.956 --> 12:53.782
Ah, shh, shh, shh. Marcel,
grown-ups are talking.

12:53.812 --> 12:56.827
Aya, how long has it been... eight,

12:56.829 --> 13:01.030
900 years since you saw this?

13:01.060 --> 13:05.115
For the uninitiated...
the charter of the Strix,

13:05.408 --> 13:08.551
written by... oh, yes... me.

13:10.445 --> 13:12.449
And it says here, it shall be

13:12.479 --> 13:15.910
my duty to uphold
the tenants of the charter.

13:15.940 --> 13:17.125
(Singsongy): Dah-dah, dah-dah, dah.

13:17.155 --> 13:18.015
Oh, this is important.

13:18.017 --> 13:19.433
"In the absence of a worthy leader,

13:19.435 --> 13:21.018
"charter shall be invoked,

13:21.020 --> 13:24.928
"and complete dominion
shall be restored to...

13:25.951 --> 13:28.297
Elijah Mikaelson."

13:28.701 --> 13:29.693
Aya: Ah.

13:30.832 --> 13:35.812
If you were determined to stake
this absurd claim as founder,

13:36.239 --> 13:39.199
then I invoke the right of Ludum Regale.

13:39.946 --> 13:41.672
I'm sorry, does someone want

13:41.674 --> 13:44.230
to please explain what the hell that is?

13:44.490 --> 13:47.294
Ludum Regale... game of kings.

13:47.324 --> 13:48.699
Let's not do this, shall we?

13:48.969 --> 13:50.514
You cannot invoke one
element of the charter

13:50.516 --> 13:51.904
and disregard the rest.

13:51.934 --> 13:54.407
As it happens, I know the rules.

13:55.418 --> 14:00.370
After all... I helped you write them.

14:02.044 --> 14:03.729
If our leadership is in doubt

14:03.759 --> 14:05.708
and politics proves divisive,

14:05.738 --> 14:07.670
a contest of strength and cunning

14:07.700 --> 14:10.045
shall determine the line of succession.

14:10.203 --> 14:13.813
So, I challenge you to a duel.

14:15.935 --> 14:18.330
Whomever holds the charter
at the stroke of midnight

14:18.360 --> 14:20.784
shall be the new leader of the Strix.

14:21.043 --> 14:23.647
You would choose strength over cunning?

14:25.418 --> 14:27.228
Do you accept?

14:50.426 --> 14:54.845
(Chanting)

14:54.847 --> 14:59.016
(Repeating chant)

15:02.516 --> 15:04.450
(Clattering)

15:19.564 --> 15:21.420
(Gasps)

15:26.879 --> 15:29.331
(Gasps)

15:33.902 --> 15:35.641
Hayley: Hey! Hey!

15:35.671 --> 15:37.585
Are you serious with all that noise?!

15:37.615 --> 15:40.106
Oh, I'm sorry. Has my therapist's betrayal

15:40.108 --> 15:42.742
inconvenienced your otherwise tranquil day?

15:42.744 --> 15:45.028
Hayley: Our daughter has been upset.

15:45.030 --> 15:48.731
She's still dealing with
the fact that Jack is gone,

15:48.761 --> 15:52.002
and the only thing that
calms her is her favorite toy,

15:52.004 --> 15:54.255
which Cami stole to get back at you.

15:54.648 --> 15:58.924
So, if you wake her up with
all this slamming around,

15:58.954 --> 16:02.212
so help me, Cami will be
the least of your problems.

16:02.214 --> 16:04.448
It pains me that Hope is upset,

16:04.478 --> 16:07.052
so I'll add it to the long list
of grievances

16:07.082 --> 16:09.335
I'm already tallying, hmm?

16:12.452 --> 16:15.775
I know that you're angry at Cami, Klaus,

16:15.777 --> 16:17.587
but you know as well as I do that

16:17.617 --> 16:19.479
she's not in her right mind.

16:19.481 --> 16:21.703
I beg to differ. Camille seems
quite lucid tucked away

16:21.733 --> 16:23.758
behind the barrier spell
in the city of the dead

16:23.788 --> 16:27.404
as she taunts me with the
very means of my demise!

16:31.889 --> 16:34.296
(Panting)

16:37.247 --> 16:40.116
Anything you care to share with the group?

16:48.618 --> 16:50.086
Oh, we're really gonna do this.

16:50.116 --> 16:51.738
Oldest, most sophisticated society

16:51.768 --> 16:53.034
of vampires in the world,

16:53.064 --> 16:55.148
and we settle our disputes like kids

16:55.178 --> 16:56.309
on the playground at recess.

16:56.339 --> 16:58.248
My sentiments precisely.

16:59.058 --> 17:00.558
Aya seems to disagree.

17:04.058 --> 17:06.607
I could order my brethren
to fight on my behalf.

17:07.281 --> 17:09.935
Such is their loyalty.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.276
But we both know, this
is between you and me.

17:15.173 --> 17:17.469
Leadership must be earned,

17:17.499 --> 17:20.386
and one way or another,
I will have that charter.

17:23.857 --> 17:25.510
Come get it.

17:27.407 --> 17:28.555
Klaus should be back by now.

17:28.585 --> 17:31.142
He's got a lot of witch weapons
to pack up, not to mention all

17:31.172 --> 17:32.482
the pride he's gonna have to swallow.

17:32.512 --> 17:34.280
You don't actually feel
sorry for him, do you?

17:34.496 --> 17:39.831
Hell, no! But you got to admit,
you poked a real irritable bear.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.769
Things are gonna be
different between you two.

17:41.771 --> 17:44.177
I know Klaus better than
anyone outside of his family.

17:44.207 --> 17:45.690
If using that knowledge is
a risk to get what I want,

17:45.692 --> 17:48.554
- then I'll take that risk.
- Okay, well, here's the thing.

17:48.584 --> 17:51.684
Klaus let you into his life
because he trusted you.

17:51.961 --> 17:53.781
That girl never would
have stolen the one thing

17:53.783 --> 17:55.883
under the sun that can kill him.

17:57.433 --> 17:58.833
That girl is dead.

18:01.977 --> 18:03.390
Come on.

18:03.392 --> 18:05.225
You know something.

18:05.689 --> 18:07.728
I can tell by the look in your face.

18:07.730 --> 18:09.602
(Sighs)

18:09.632 --> 18:12.015
If I knew something, I'd tell you.

18:12.017 --> 18:14.184
We're supposed to be sisters now, right?

18:14.186 --> 18:15.961
I don't know about that.

18:15.991 --> 18:18.093
After all, the weapon
that we're looking for will

18:18.123 --> 18:22.851
probably be used to wipe
out a whole sire line,

18:24.063 --> 18:26.363
including some of your vampire friends.

18:26.365 --> 18:27.726
(Laughs softly)

18:31.328 --> 18:32.752
Is that what this is?

18:32.782 --> 18:36.034
Pick on the new girl 'cause
she knows a few vampires?

18:36.237 --> 18:39.827
Big deal. I agreed to work
with the Strix, same as you.

18:39.829 --> 18:41.556
You're nothing like me.

18:41.586 --> 18:44.517
You actually believe Aya's going
to make good on her promises.

18:44.547 --> 18:46.416
She already has.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.144
She gave me the spell to help the person

18:48.174 --> 18:50.524
that I care about more than anything.

18:51.792 --> 18:53.706
All I need now is power,

18:53.736 --> 18:56.286
and I'll do whatever I have to to get it.

18:57.602 --> 19:00.102
I was just a kid when I became a sister.

19:01.004 --> 19:05.237
My family was poor, my mother was sick.

19:05.267 --> 19:06.669
All I wanted

19:06.699 --> 19:08.746
was to help them.

19:10.359 --> 19:12.501
And there was Aya...

19:13.596 --> 19:16.079
With all of her promises.

19:16.519 --> 19:19.819
By the time I finished doing
everything she asked me...

19:20.444 --> 19:25.422
My own mother couldn't
even stand the sight of me.

19:26.776 --> 19:31.867
See, Davina, real magic,
like we use here...

19:32.110 --> 19:34.097
it would change you.

19:35.181 --> 19:36.517
My guess is, it'll be right after

19:36.547 --> 19:38.093
you've saved that person you care about.

19:38.123 --> 19:41.355
That's when you'll lose everything.

19:41.357 --> 19:46.075
You're wrong, because that
person that I care about...

19:46.663 --> 19:48.563
He means way too much to me.

19:49.958 --> 19:53.706
All I care about is
leaving this damn coven.

19:53.736 --> 19:57.670
But first you're gonna tell
me what you know.

19:57.912 --> 19:59.799
(Gasps)

20:00.669 --> 20:02.557
(Chanting)

20:10.770 --> 20:12.122
(Gasps)

20:12.124 --> 20:14.875
(Yells, panting)

20:20.716 --> 20:23.050
(Grunting)

20:24.103 --> 20:25.886
(Lively crowd chatter)

20:25.888 --> 20:27.157
You quite done?

20:27.187 --> 20:29.223
You'd have me submit?

20:29.253 --> 20:33.894
Once again, I prove I have
a mind of my own.

20:33.896 --> 20:35.527
(Grunting)

20:35.557 --> 20:37.224
(Aya groaning, panting)

20:37.254 --> 20:39.670
Let's not make this more
unpleasant than it needs to be.

20:39.994 --> 20:41.436
After all this time,

20:41.466 --> 20:44.571
how could you think
that we would follow you?

20:44.573 --> 20:46.573
- (Soft grunt)
- (Grunting)

20:46.575 --> 20:49.743
(Crowd chatter, Aya grunting)

20:54.083 --> 20:58.585
All of you swore loyalty to a serpent

20:58.587 --> 21:00.554
who seized control of this fellowship,

21:00.556 --> 21:02.923
all in the name of furthering his tyranny.

21:02.925 --> 21:07.061
Seize control... is that
how you rewrite history?

21:08.138 --> 21:10.389
You ran like a coward,

21:10.419 --> 21:16.670
leaving Strix to be slaughtered
by your mad father.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.026
I had no choice.

21:18.056 --> 21:20.863
We all have a choice!

21:20.893 --> 21:22.369
And that day I watched as

21:22.399 --> 21:24.854
my fellow Strix were
slaughtered by the dozens.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.620
I returned.

21:27.192 --> 21:32.107
The moment I knew that my
family was safe, I returned...

21:32.137 --> 21:33.848
to the horror...

21:34.679 --> 21:37.808
the wreckage, the corpses, the ruin.

21:38.445 --> 21:42.185
The devastation that I felt
when I thought of your death.

21:42.215 --> 21:44.142
But I did not die!

21:44.172 --> 21:47.696
Thanks to the efforts of a true nobleman.

21:47.726 --> 21:50.683
Tristan saved us!

21:51.584 --> 21:53.229
He earned our loyalty.

21:53.259 --> 21:55.588
Tristan is a vulture,

21:55.618 --> 21:59.463
a usurper who stole our very dream...

21:59.465 --> 22:01.737
Violating everything
that we once fought for,

22:01.767 --> 22:05.591
all in the name of the twisted crusade.

22:05.621 --> 22:07.832
Say what you will.

22:07.862 --> 22:10.486
You choose your own family always,

22:10.516 --> 22:12.616
above all.

22:15.074 --> 22:17.881
You're as cursed as them.

22:20.219 --> 22:21.940
(Grunting)

22:22.910 --> 22:25.304
This is Elijah Mikaelson,

22:25.334 --> 22:28.509
traitor to our cause!

22:29.213 --> 22:31.512
You know I would rather die

22:31.514 --> 22:33.975
than accept you as leader.

22:34.477 --> 22:35.899
(Grunting)

22:35.901 --> 22:37.759
(Gasping)

22:38.884 --> 22:41.355
If that's your ultimatum...

22:42.070 --> 22:44.408
then I accept.

22:47.863 --> 22:50.414
(Panting, coughing)

22:54.119 --> 22:57.261
Marcel: I thought you two were
gonna talk each other to death.

22:57.291 --> 23:00.127
But since this is my city,
I say we play by my rules.

23:00.157 --> 23:01.339
So...

23:01.369 --> 23:03.334
Catch me if you can.

23:03.364 --> 23:05.413
If not, come midnight,

23:05.443 --> 23:07.785
I'm in charge.

23:24.924 --> 23:26.794
If someone's playing games,

23:26.824 --> 23:28.508
just know the contest ends

23:28.538 --> 23:30.707
when I claim...

23:36.850 --> 23:39.684
(Beeping)

23:40.520 --> 23:42.737
Camille!

23:42.739 --> 23:45.356
(Wind blowing)

23:48.745 --> 23:52.080
(Piano playing soft song)

24:13.303 --> 24:15.970
♪ ♪

24:23.662 --> 24:26.103
A young upstart steals our charter,

24:26.133 --> 24:28.164
Yet you don't seem all that concerned.

24:28.194 --> 24:30.540
Well, I have my sources
searching for Marcel.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.831
They won't be long.

24:31.861 --> 24:35.135
Still, I can't imagine
that this turn of events

24:35.165 --> 24:37.375
will improve your odds.

24:37.377 --> 24:39.294
The game's not over.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.879
When the Strix find Marcel,

24:41.881 --> 24:44.736
they'll take back the charter
and hand-deliver it to me.

24:44.766 --> 24:46.052
Interesting.

24:46.082 --> 24:51.007
Of course, Marcel is very
popular with the locals.

24:51.037 --> 24:53.137
You understand that if he seeks refuge

24:53.167 --> 24:56.202
in any one of the many
residences around here,

24:56.232 --> 24:59.597
Neither you nor I may enter.

25:04.014 --> 25:05.937
At the gym...

25:09.203 --> 25:10.747
you had the chance to end me.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.493
You hesitated.

25:14.247 --> 25:16.114
Why?

25:20.084 --> 25:22.287
I wouldn't be too concerned.

25:23.205 --> 25:26.581
Should the opportunity
present itself again,

25:26.611 --> 25:29.374
I'll be certain to finish the task.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.976
(Rattling)

25:49.939 --> 25:51.921
Something's not right.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.235
Hey, stay here.

25:55.850 --> 25:57.512
Camille!

25:57.542 --> 25:59.634
She can't hear you.

26:00.257 --> 26:02.266
As a matter of fact,

26:02.296 --> 26:04.912
pretty soon now, she'll be dead.

26:06.984 --> 26:10.344
I hope you two parted on good terms.

26:13.716 --> 26:15.973
Show yourself.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.175
(Whispering voices)

26:19.404 --> 26:21.062
You're one of the coven

26:21.064 --> 26:22.902
affiliated with the Strix.

26:22.932 --> 26:26.934
My sisters and I have come for
the one thing that can kill you.

26:26.936 --> 26:29.595
Well, perhaps I'll find
your sisters and feed them

26:29.625 --> 26:32.773
what remains of your insides.

26:32.775 --> 26:33.775
(Shouts)

26:34.727 --> 26:36.277
I have a better idea.

26:40.450 --> 26:41.782
(Shouts)

26:46.599 --> 26:47.673
(Crack)

26:50.517 --> 26:52.043
Where have you been?

26:52.656 --> 26:53.764
We're not alone.

26:53.794 --> 26:55.591
How is that even possible? What
happened to the boundary spell?

26:55.621 --> 26:57.703
That's all good when you're
trying to keep out a vampire.

26:57.733 --> 26:59.967
This feels like something different.

27:08.197 --> 27:10.188
This here is hallowed ground,

27:10.218 --> 27:12.730
home to the nine covens of New Orleans.

27:13.027 --> 27:15.278
Y'all need to be on y'all's way.

27:15.818 --> 27:18.986
(Groans, hisses)

27:20.815 --> 27:24.215
Okay, I'm gonna give you one
guess what they're here for.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.336
Cami, either they're gonna kill you

27:27.366 --> 27:29.795
or Klaus will for losing
that thing. You need to go.

27:29.825 --> 27:31.544
No. What about you?

27:31.574 --> 27:32.847
Go. Run.

27:32.877 --> 27:34.145
Now.

27:39.676 --> 27:41.676
(Exhales)

27:41.678 --> 27:44.595
(Rumbling)

27:47.233 --> 27:48.566
(Panting)

27:55.408 --> 27:57.692
Who the hell are you?

27:57.694 --> 27:59.744
Does it really matter?

28:00.234 --> 28:02.697
You know what I've come for.

28:03.643 --> 28:05.253
Hand it over.

28:09.821 --> 28:12.557
I'm not going to ask twice.

28:13.092 --> 28:17.044
- (Cracking)
- (Screaming)

28:17.046 --> 28:19.912
(Panting, moaning)

28:21.783 --> 28:24.345
You have a high tolerance for pain.

28:24.761 --> 28:27.289
Let's see how high.

28:27.774 --> 28:30.057
- (Cracking)
- (Screams)

28:30.915 --> 28:32.560
No.

28:32.562 --> 28:35.062
(Pants)

28:37.058 --> 28:39.015
(Grunting)

28:43.790 --> 28:46.290
(High-pitched whistling)

28:46.292 --> 28:48.492
(Grunting)

28:48.494 --> 28:50.077
(Moans)

28:55.885 --> 28:59.253
(Chanting)

29:03.816 --> 29:05.322
(Panting)

29:25.383 --> 29:28.323
Well, this little escapade has
been very cute indeed, Marcel.

29:28.353 --> 29:30.937
Why don't you come outside
and give me the charter?

29:30.939 --> 29:34.156
Mm, no. No, I'm fine right where I am.

29:34.158 --> 29:36.359
I got about three minutes

29:36.389 --> 29:38.563
until I'm the new Grand Poobah.

29:38.593 --> 29:41.827
Until then, good luck trying to find me.

29:41.857 --> 29:43.833
Look outside.

29:50.842 --> 29:52.291
(Scoffs)

29:54.013 --> 29:55.353
It's not difficult to track your enemies

29:55.383 --> 29:57.630
when your sister's a witch.

29:57.632 --> 29:59.131
Well, in that case, good luck

29:59.133 --> 30:01.017
getting in without an invitation.

30:01.019 --> 30:03.166
If you think I'm above burning
this place to the ground,

30:03.196 --> 30:04.757
you are gravely mistaken.

30:04.787 --> 30:06.540
Well, that's not very civilized,

30:06.570 --> 30:08.198
is it?

30:09.345 --> 30:11.017
Outside.

30:11.047 --> 30:12.657
Now.

30:21.372 --> 30:23.739
(Bell tinkles)

30:27.573 --> 30:29.067
Elijah?

30:29.097 --> 30:31.210
Please come in.

30:52.599 --> 30:54.937
You realize this is your doing.

30:54.939 --> 30:58.110
Your attempt to manipulate me
played right into our enemies' hands.

30:58.140 --> 31:00.673
And I said I'm sorry. Your apologies
won't bring back what's been lost.

31:00.703 --> 31:05.651
Then shut up and let vincent
track down that witch!

31:09.237 --> 31:10.387
Where do you think you're going?

31:10.417 --> 31:11.669
I want to find her just as much as you do,

31:11.699 --> 31:13.355
but I cannot concentrate,

31:13.357 --> 31:15.146
not with this pointless bickering.

31:15.176 --> 31:16.508
Klaus: Well, then, by all means,

31:16.510 --> 31:18.604
please, go, attend to your task.

31:18.634 --> 31:22.379
You, however, are not
going to leave my sight!

31:23.401 --> 31:24.601
(Bell tinkles)

31:27.149 --> 31:28.102
It's midnight, Elijah.

31:28.132 --> 31:29.961
Time's run out. According to our own laws,

31:29.991 --> 31:31.014
The contest is complete.

31:31.044 --> 31:33.345
Guess that makes me the winner.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.358
Ridiculous.

31:35.388 --> 31:37.631
This wasn't a contest. This was evasion.

31:37.661 --> 31:40.639
I had a little time to read your charter.

31:41.020 --> 31:44.370
The ludum regale was never
meant to be just a fistfight.

31:44.973 --> 31:47.590
Aspiring leaders face off

31:47.592 --> 31:50.509
in a contest that requires cunning.

31:50.726 --> 31:52.344
Why?

31:52.631 --> 31:54.180
Because you want a leader

31:54.182 --> 31:56.078
with more brains than brawn.

31:56.108 --> 31:58.350
Reason I beat you all is because I know

31:58.352 --> 32:00.791
every nook and cranny in the Quarter.

32:01.070 --> 32:04.523
Underground tunnels, secret
passageways between properties.

32:04.525 --> 32:07.409
And since I'm so charming,

32:07.411 --> 32:09.111
I get invited everywhere.

32:13.584 --> 32:15.084
(Grunts)

32:18.277 --> 32:19.288
Hey, you kill me,

32:19.290 --> 32:21.340
You are in violation of
your own damn charter.

32:21.370 --> 32:22.207
(Grunts)

32:22.237 --> 32:23.876
Nobody's gonna follow
your rules if you can't

32:23.878 --> 32:25.692
follow them yourself.

32:26.125 --> 32:29.048
He's right, Elijah. Let him go.

32:30.601 --> 32:32.051
(Chuckles)

32:32.053 --> 32:34.887
(Grunts, coughs)

32:34.889 --> 32:36.555
(Panting)

32:43.981 --> 32:47.005
I'm not the strongest one here.

32:48.442 --> 32:49.892
But I won the game.

32:51.669 --> 32:54.693
I've been watching the
Mikaelsons my whole life.

32:54.723 --> 32:57.413
Studied them since I was a kid.

32:57.443 --> 33:01.080
That's how I drove them out of
New Orleans in the first place.

33:01.507 --> 33:03.897
Rebuilt this city in my image

33:03.927 --> 33:05.841
under my rules.

33:05.871 --> 33:07.920
Offered alliances to all of my friends

33:07.922 --> 33:10.129
and got rid of everybody else.

33:10.159 --> 33:13.676
This is my city because I took it.

33:14.595 --> 33:17.146
That is what a leader does!

33:21.111 --> 33:22.234
If this prophecy

33:22.236 --> 33:24.436
that you're all afraid of is gonna happen,

33:24.438 --> 33:26.405
it's gonna happen here,

33:26.407 --> 33:28.147
on my streets.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.109
And if we're gonna stop it

33:30.111 --> 33:32.278
from killing us all,

33:32.280 --> 33:34.697
who's a better leader than me?

33:34.699 --> 33:35.932
This is absurd.

33:35.962 --> 33:37.732
Marcel has won.

33:38.336 --> 33:41.453
Better to stand with him and fight to live

33:41.455 --> 33:43.672
than stand with you.

33:43.674 --> 33:46.208
You'll be little more than an afterthought.

33:51.108 --> 33:54.633
To the new leader of the Strix...

33:54.935 --> 33:57.102
Marcel Gerard.

34:04.976 --> 34:08.030
What were you thinking? Did it
occur to you, the immense danger

34:08.032 --> 34:10.143
you placed yourself in?
You were almost killed!

34:10.172 --> 34:13.581
I would have been. Thank
God I had my dark objects.

34:13.612 --> 34:15.120
The amount of vulnerability you're feeling

34:15.121 --> 34:16.655
right now, Klaus... that's what I deal with

34:16.657 --> 34:18.157
all the time. Why do you
think I'm so desperate

34:18.159 --> 34:20.125
to protect myself? If you had just

34:20.127 --> 34:21.210
given me what I asked for...

34:21.212 --> 34:23.088
Do not blame me.

34:23.989 --> 34:25.751
I took a calculated risk,

34:25.781 --> 34:27.833
Yes. Did it blow up in my face?

34:27.835 --> 34:30.782
Yes. And I am sorry.

34:30.812 --> 34:33.138
I am. But if you had just listened to me

34:33.139 --> 34:34.840
we wouldn't be here right now.

34:34.842 --> 34:36.675
- (Phone ringing)
- It's the same story with you, Klaus.

34:36.677 --> 34:38.677
For a thousand years you-you control,

34:38.679 --> 34:41.513
you manipulate, you do whatever
you need to do to get your way.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.849
And I'm not gonna be a part
of it anymore. I don't care

34:43.851 --> 34:48.210
- how high the risk is.
- Answer your bloody phone, would you?

34:48.239 --> 34:50.074
- What?
- Cami, you have to listen to me.

34:50.103 --> 34:51.716
One of the Strix witches knows

34:51.746 --> 34:54.020
where you are and she knows
that you have the white oak.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.458
You're a little late,
kiddo. She already took it,

34:56.489 --> 34:58.080
which means, I guess,
the Strix have it now.

34:58.082 --> 35:00.366
No, you don't understand.
When she got inside my head,

35:00.368 --> 35:04.814
I got inside hers. She's
not working for the Strix.

35:13.464 --> 35:16.537
So? I trust it went well?

35:16.567 --> 35:17.650
(Gasps)

35:17.680 --> 35:19.385
Oh!

35:22.306 --> 35:25.606
So much fuss over such a little trinket.

35:25.636 --> 35:28.227
You know, I'm so glad
that I can rely on you.

35:28.229 --> 35:30.203
You've more than earned your reward.

35:30.233 --> 35:32.686
And now you will help me.

35:32.716 --> 35:35.422
Free me from my perpetual
servitude to the Strix.

35:35.452 --> 35:36.452
Yes.

35:37.049 --> 35:39.187
I'll end it right now.

35:41.275 --> 35:43.809
(shrieks, grunts)

35:54.655 --> 35:56.371
(Chuckles)

36:04.814 --> 36:07.871
♪♪

36:07.901 --> 36:10.151
You had to punch your
hand through my chest.

36:10.153 --> 36:12.153
Oh, for the love... (sighs)

36:12.205 --> 36:16.791
Marcel, I was in character.
The moment took me.

36:16.793 --> 36:19.877
Besides, between that absurd contest

36:19.879 --> 36:21.151
And your master class performance...

36:21.181 --> 36:22.311
Thank you.

36:22.341 --> 36:24.649
They were beautifully
distracted from this whole

36:24.651 --> 36:26.607
white oak business. So...

36:26.637 --> 36:28.136
To the new Grand Poobah.

36:28.138 --> 36:29.888
Right. Uh, which, actually

36:29.890 --> 36:31.440
Brings me to my next point.

36:31.442 --> 36:33.225
Even if I can control your friends,

36:33.227 --> 36:34.693
What about your enemies?

36:34.695 --> 36:36.027
If a sire line war heats up,

36:36.029 --> 36:37.323
The Quarter is gonna become a war zone.

36:37.353 --> 36:39.531
And now we have an army.

36:39.847 --> 36:42.984
So perhaps we can keep this
wretched prophecy at bay.

36:42.986 --> 36:45.487
Oh, that's right. We fight
so you live, because

36:45.489 --> 36:47.873
If Klaus falls, so do I.
And if you fall, well,

36:48.527 --> 36:49.574
There go the Strix.

36:49.576 --> 36:51.076
Indeed.

36:51.078 --> 36:52.994
Try to keep those clowns in line.

37:00.854 --> 37:02.604
Thank you, Davina,

37:02.945 --> 37:05.724
For your kindness.

37:06.727 --> 37:08.277
How are you here?

37:08.279 --> 37:10.312
You consecrated me.

37:10.714 --> 37:13.415
- You're with the ancestors, with... ?
- Yes.

37:13.417 --> 37:15.934
With Kol.

37:15.936 --> 37:19.521
And things are not going well for him.

37:20.691 --> 37:21.973
Can you help him?

37:22.883 --> 37:24.859
You have to help him.

37:24.861 --> 37:27.559
You're the only one who can.

37:27.908 --> 37:29.864
Our coven's magic is dark

37:29.866 --> 37:31.900
And it comes at a very high price.

37:31.902 --> 37:34.903
But together, as sisters, we are powerful.

37:34.905 --> 37:38.373
You can use that power
to save your friend Kol.

37:39.659 --> 37:41.326
If not, you will lose him to a fate

37:41.328 --> 37:43.661
Far worse than death.

37:59.882 --> 38:02.564
I have killed many, many people

38:02.566 --> 38:03.529
for far less than what you've done.

38:03.559 --> 38:05.483
What do you want me to say, Klaus?

38:05.485 --> 38:07.152
Thank you for not killing me?

38:07.154 --> 38:08.770
You're in the throes of a metamorphosis

38:08.772 --> 38:10.605
you cannot possibly comprehend.

38:10.607 --> 38:12.941
One that has clearly
impaired your judgment.

38:12.943 --> 38:15.160
I may not yet know who I am or what I am,

38:15.162 --> 38:17.612
but I do know I will never live in fear

38:17.614 --> 38:19.864
of anyone again.

38:19.866 --> 38:21.866
Ever.

38:25.872 --> 38:29.174
You could have trusted me.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.842
- Klaus...
- (Door opens)

38:30.844 --> 38:33.461
(door closes)

38:35.182 --> 38:37.465
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

38:38.969 --> 38:41.524
You've no idea where to begin, do you?

38:41.554 --> 38:43.471
I'm no stranger to running things.

38:43.473 --> 38:45.473
I've been doing it here for a long while.

38:45.475 --> 38:47.725
Well, give or take an intermission or two.

38:48.895 --> 38:50.445
First thing I'd like to do is make sure

38:50.447 --> 38:52.614
I know who's on my side.

38:54.818 --> 38:56.985
The problem, as I see it, is simple.

38:56.987 --> 38:59.788
The Strix are comprised
one sire line. And now

38:59.790 --> 39:02.707
we are to be led by a vampire from another.

39:02.709 --> 39:04.375
Regardless of the distinction,

39:04.377 --> 39:07.045
all our lives are bound
to those who made us.

39:07.047 --> 39:10.665
And should this prophecy come
to pass, we will all perish.

39:10.667 --> 39:14.552
As leader, how would
you navigate that threat?

39:16.060 --> 39:17.555
You don't go to war

39:17.557 --> 39:18.973
without wise guidance.

39:18.975 --> 39:21.643
Victory depends on having many advisors.

39:21.645 --> 39:23.261
And by the look in your eyes, it looks like

39:23.263 --> 39:25.146
you have some advice to give.

39:26.516 --> 39:29.934
So... spill it.

39:29.936 --> 39:31.519
Not that long ago

39:31.521 --> 39:33.571
We developed a contingency plan.

39:33.573 --> 39:35.356
♪♪

39:35.358 --> 39:38.409
There is a reason I recruited
Davina Claire.

39:38.411 --> 39:40.723
You see, with the right
witches, the correct spell,

39:40.753 --> 39:43.331
the precise binding agent,

39:43.333 --> 39:46.213
there is a means to eradicate
our link to our sires.

39:46.243 --> 39:48.895
Making us free from the
Mikaelsons forever.

39:48.925 --> 39:52.112
Then, and only then, will we
have true independence.

39:52.142 --> 39:53.425
Davina is...

39:53.917 --> 39:57.636
obstinate, but she will listen to you.

39:57.666 --> 40:00.182
So what do you say?

40:00.741 --> 40:03.402
Will you lead the Strix to freedom?

40:10.879 --> 40:14.257
I trust Freya had no
luck finding that witch.

40:14.287 --> 40:15.831
Not in the...

40:15.833 --> 40:19.861
Seven minutes since your
last inquiry, niKlaus, no.

40:20.311 --> 40:22.370
Aurora's involvement changes everything.

40:22.372 --> 40:24.372
If Aya and the Strix had
the oak, we could at least

40:24.374 --> 40:25.924
be certain you were not the target.

40:25.926 --> 40:27.843
But with the weapon in Aurora's hands...

40:28.213 --> 40:30.212
I do wonder which one of us
she'll try and kill first.

40:30.722 --> 40:32.547
You broke her heart, I...

40:32.549 --> 40:34.433
broke her mind.

40:34.635 --> 40:37.052
I suppose both of us share the sin

40:37.054 --> 40:39.504
of Tristan's unceremonious burial at sea.

40:39.889 --> 40:41.139
Mm.

40:41.666 --> 40:42.924
It's normally we

40:42.926 --> 40:45.310
who pose the threat to our intimates.

40:45.535 --> 40:46.895
It's an odd feeling...

40:47.304 --> 40:48.847
The roles reversed.

40:49.983 --> 40:53.485
I always did loathe irony.

40:55.272 --> 40:57.439
(Man grunts softly)

41:15.759 --> 41:17.926
I finished the last one.

41:25.749 --> 41:26.768
Fabulous.

41:26.970 --> 41:28.687
If you don't mind my asking,

41:28.689 --> 41:31.439
What animal do you aim to hunt
with bullets made of wood?

41:31.951 --> 41:34.025
Not an animal at all, darling.

41:34.579 --> 41:36.311
A monster.

41:37.556 --> 41:39.147
An entire family of them.
