01:24.961 --> 01:25.754
HI, PA.

01:25.920 --> 01:26.880
HI, HALF-PINT.

01:27.046 --> 01:28.214
HOW'S IT GOING?

01:28.381 --> 01:30.049
IT'S ALMOST FINISHED.
WHERE'S YOUR SISTER?

01:30.216 --> 01:33.303
SHE'LL BE LATE.
SHE'S HELPING
MRS. WHIPPLE.

01:33.470 --> 01:35.555
SHE'S GOT A LOT
OF EXTRA SEWING
TO DO RIGHT NOW.

01:35.722 --> 01:36.848
OH. SOUNDS LIKE
YOUR SISTER'S

01:37.015 --> 01:38.600
GOING TO BE A VERY
WEALTHY WOMAN.

01:38.767 --> 01:40.059
YEAH.

01:40.226 --> 01:42.228
I'LL BET, WITH
A FINE BAT LIKE THAT,

01:42.395 --> 01:44.355
YOU'RE SURE TO HIT
A HOME RUN THIS YEAR.

01:44.522 --> 01:45.899
WELL, IF I DO, IT'LL BE
THE FIRST HOME RUN

01:46.065 --> 01:47.984
WE EVER GOT
OFF OF SLEEPY EYE.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.444
ONE THING FOR SURE.

01:49.611 --> 01:51.237
PITCHER'S NOT GOING
TO BREAK THE BAT OFF
IN MY HANDS

01:51.404 --> 01:52.906
LIKE HE DID
LAST YEAR.

01:53.072 --> 01:54.949
THAT SLICK McBURNEY
THROWS HARD, HUH?

01:55.116 --> 01:57.660
ABOUT AS HARD
AS ANY MAN
I'VE EVER SEEN.

01:57.827 --> 02:00.747
WELL, YOU'RE GOING
TO BEAT HIM THIS YEAR.
I KNOW YOU WILL.

02:00.914 --> 02:03.458
WELL, THANKS FOR
YOUR SHOW OF CONFIDENCE,
HALF-PINT,

02:03.625 --> 02:04.626
BUT UNLESS WE CAN
FIND A PITCHER

02:04.793 --> 02:06.419
THAT THROWS AS HARD
AS McBURNEY,

02:06.586 --> 02:08.755
I'M AFRAID WE'RE
GOING TO BE IN FOR
A VERY LONG DAY.

02:08.922 --> 02:11.883
WELL, YOU ALWAYS SAY
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
YOU'RE GOING TO WIN

02:12.050 --> 02:14.093
OR NOBODY ELSE WILL.

02:14.260 --> 02:17.096
WELL, IF I SAID
THAT, THEN I GUESS I
BETTER PRACTICE IT.

02:17.263 --> 02:18.765
AND WITH THE TWO
OF US BELIEVING,

02:18.932 --> 02:21.267
I'D SAY WE HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD START.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.146
THAT WE DO,
HALF-PINT.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.523
THAT WE DO.

02:28.233 --> 02:29.651
HI, MA.

02:29.818 --> 02:31.778
WELL, I FINISHED
MISS MUMFORT'S
ROCKER

02:31.945 --> 02:33.363
AND MY BASEBALL
BAT, TOO.

02:33.530 --> 02:35.406
CAN CARRIE PLAY
BASEBALL, TOO, PA?

02:35.573 --> 02:36.533
WHY SURE,
AS SOON AS YOU GET

02:36.699 --> 02:37.951
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
IN THE BRITCHES.

02:38.117 --> 02:39.953
COULDN'T BE WORSE THAN
THE REST OF THE TEAM.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.288
Laura: WELL, WE'RE GOING
TO WIN THIS YEAR, MA.

02:42.455 --> 02:44.582
WELL, IT'S NOT WINNING
I'M THINKING ABOUT.

02:44.749 --> 02:46.084
IT'S THE LANGUAGE
THEY USE AND...

02:46.251 --> 02:47.418
AND THE BRAWLING.

02:47.585 --> 02:48.628
IT'S NOT A FIT SPECTACLE
FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.

02:48.795 --> 02:50.004
OH, NOW, CAROLINE,

02:50.171 --> 02:52.006
YOU'RE GETTING
YOURSELF ALL UPSET
OVER NOTHING.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.217
THERE'S ALWAYS
DISAGREEMENTS IN
A SPORTING CONTEST.

02:54.384 --> 02:56.719
SPORTING? CHARLES,
THERE'S NOTHING
SPORTING ABOUT IT.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.304
THOSE GREEN EYES WILL
COME OVER HERE AND--

02:58.471 --> 02:59.514
GREEN STOCKINGS,
MA.

02:59.681 --> 03:00.723
HA HA'.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.350
GREEN STOCKINGS,
WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.018
THEY ALWAYS WIN.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.854
LAST YEAR,
THEY BEAT YOU 36-0.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.647
WE WOULD HAVE SCORED
IF THEY HADN'T
CALLED THE GAME

03:07.814 --> 03:09.899
ON ACCOUNT
OF DARKNESS
IN THE THIRD INNING.

03:10.066 --> 03:10.984
BESIDES, WE GOT
TO PLAY SLEEPY EYE.

03:11.150 --> 03:11.985
IT'S A MATTER
OF PRIDE.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.695
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

03:13.862 --> 03:15.488
I GUESS I DO.

03:15.655 --> 03:18.491
I'VE ALREADY STARTED
SEWING THESE LETTERS
ON YOUR SHIRT.

03:18.658 --> 03:21.035
WELL, HEY'.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.954
LOOK AT THAT.

03:23.121 --> 03:25.665
HEY, WEARING
A SHIRT LIKE THAT,
I BETTER PLAY GOOD.

03:25.832 --> 03:26.666
COME ON. WE GOT
A LITTLE TIME

03:26.833 --> 03:27.750
TO PRACTICE
BEFORE SUPPER.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.627
OK.

03:29.794 --> 03:31.504
CARRIE PLAY

03:47.270 --> 03:50.398
OH, JEBEDIAH, WHEN YOU
FINISH WITH THAT FENCE,

03:50.565 --> 03:52.650
WHY DON'T YOU FETCH ME
A JAR OF RHUBARB
FROM THE CELLAR?

03:52.817 --> 03:56.029
I'LL MAKE YOU ONE OF
YOUR FAVORITE RHUBARB
PIES THIS MORNING.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.531
BUT WE HAD RHUBARB
LAST WEEK.

03:58.698 --> 04:02.243
JEBEDIAH, YOU KNOW
HOW YOU LIKE RHUBARB.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.536
YES, MARGARET.

04:06.539 --> 04:07.707

04:13.129 --> 04:14.881
Jebediah:
NICE TO SEE YOU.

04:15.048 --> 04:17.008
OH'. DIDN'T EXPECT
TO GET MARGARET'S
ROCKER BACK

04:17.175 --> 04:18.217
TILL NEXT WEEK'.

04:18.384 --> 04:19.844
WELL, WORK WENT A LOT FASTER
THAN I THOUGHT.

04:20.011 --> 04:21.054
HALF-PINT AND I
WERE GOING INTO TOWN
TO BASEBALL PRACTICE.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.722
THOUGHT WE'D
DROP IT BY.

04:22.889 --> 04:24.557
WELL, BRING IT IN
THE HOUSE. I'LL GIVE
YOU A CUP OF COFFEE.

04:24.724 --> 04:25.892
SURE AM OBLIGED.
ALL RIGHT.

04:26.059 --> 04:27.143
Laura: CAN I GET
A DRINK OF WATER?

04:27.310 --> 04:28.937
SURE, HONEY.
YOU KNOW WHERE
THE WELL IS.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.480
OH, MY GOODNESS,
CHARLES,

04:30.647 --> 04:32.315
THAT ROCKER HASN'T
LOOKED THAT GOOD
SINCE IT WAS NEW.

04:32.482 --> 04:33.775

THAT'S GOOD WOOD.

04:33.942 --> 04:38.279

WHAT'S WRONG?

04:49.791 --> 04:51.626
THERE'S A CHICKEN HAWK
ABOUT TO GET ONE
OF YOUR CHICKENS.

05:04.889 --> 05:08.476
Margaret: JEBEDIAH,
YOU PUT THREE HOLES
IN THAT COOP ALREADY.

05:08.643 --> 05:09.602
Jebediah:
I'M SORRY, MARGARET.

05:09.769 --> 05:10.812
I'LL PATCH THEM UP.

05:10.979 --> 05:12.689
WELL, COME ON IN
AND FINISH YOUR COFFEE.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.444

SURE ARE PESKY.

05:18.611 --> 05:21.322

SOME THROW, MR. MUMFORT.

OH. THANK YOU, LAURA.
SHOULD HAVE GOT HIM,
THOUGH.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.162
YOU MEAN YOU
USUALLY HIT THEM?

05:28.329 --> 05:29.455
NEARLY EVERY TIME.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.544
WHY DON'T HALF-PINT
AND I GIVE YOU A HAND
WITH THE CHICKEN COOP?

05:34.711 --> 05:36.212
I'M GRATEFUL
FOR THE HAND.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.548
WELL, I'D LIKE TO
TALK OVER A LITTLE
PROPOSITION WITH YOU.

05:38.715 --> 05:39.924
WELL, WHAT KIND
OF PROPOSITION?

05:40.091 --> 05:41.300

WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO WEAR?

06:12.123 --> 06:13.833
IT'S MY OLD
COLLEGE UNIFORM.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.043
OH.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.336
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "OH"?

06:17.503 --> 06:18.880
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
AS I'D AGREED TO
PLAY THIS GAME

06:19.047 --> 06:21.174
IF I KNEW I
HAD TO SHUCK DOWN
TO MY LONG JOHNS.

06:24.844 --> 06:26.012

06:28.264 --> 06:31.309
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO PITCH WITH
A THING LIKE THIS?

06:31.476 --> 06:32.643
IT'S NOT EVEN ROUND.

06:32.810 --> 06:33.853
THAT'S JUST
FOR PRACTICE.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.688
I'M SAVING
THE GAME BALLS.

06:35.855 --> 06:39.192
AND THE WAY YOU THROW,
YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE
THE DIFFERENCE.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.027
I DID MY BEST
LAST YEAR.

06:41.194 --> 06:42.528

THIS YEAR.

06:56.501 --> 06:58.044

ON THE TEAM, EDWARDS.

06:58.211 --> 06:59.587

THROWS, YOU CATCH IT,

06:59.754 --> 07:00.671
YOU THROW IT RIGHT
BACK TO HIM.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.465

HAVE TO MOVE.

ABOUT ANYTHING

WITH GAMES.

GOT TO THROW

IF WHAT HE SHOWED ME
IS ANY EXAMPLE,

07:35.414 --> 07:36.582
WE GOT OURSELVES
A PITCHER.

07:36.749 --> 07:39.043
LET'S SEE WHAT
HE CAN DO.

07:39.210 --> 07:41.546
THAT'S A POOR
EXCUSE FOR A BALL.
LOOK AT THAT.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.881
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK IT'S
KIND OF PRETTY.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.591
OH, THERE'S
NO NEED TO GET
YOUR DANDER UP, NELS.

07:45.758 --> 07:48.427

SOMEBODY ELSE OUT.

WAIT A MINUTE.

07:53.599 --> 07:56.185

TRY IT AGAIN, NELS?

09:26.234 --> 09:30.655
NO. I THINK I'LL LET
JEBEDIAH TRY ONE.

KILLED HIM'.

DIFFERENT THIS YEAR'.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.089
BE PROUD TO DO IT.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.513
MA, MA'. WAIT TILL YOU HEAR'.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.931
CAROLINE, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE THIS,

10:39.098 --> 10:41.183
BUT WALNUT GROVE'S GOT
THEMSELVES A PITCHER.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.561
JEBEDIAH MAY BE
JUST ABOUT THE BEST
THERE EVER WAS.

10:43.728 --> 10:44.937
YOU MEAN MR. MUMFORT?

10:45.104 --> 10:46.272
HE THROWS
A REAL BLUE DARTER'.

10:46.439 --> 10:47.773
AT LEAST THAT'S
WHAT PA CALLS IT.

10:47.940 --> 10:50.234
JEBEDIAH MUMFORT?
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

10:50.401 --> 10:51.610
WELL, SEEING
IS BELIEVING,
AND JEBEDIAH

10:51.777 --> 10:53.070
IS THE ANSWER
TO WALNUT GROVE'S
PRAYERS.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.488
CHARLES,
I THINK THE LORD

10:54.655 --> 10:57.325
HAS MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS ON HIS MIND
THAN BASEBALL.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.951
WELL, MAYBE SO, BUT
I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

10:59.118 --> 11:00.619
JEBEDIAH'S FASTBALL
IS HEAVEN-SENT.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.371
WE'RE SURE
TO WIN THIS YEAR.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.373
WELL, NOW, I'M NOT
SO SURE OF THAT, BUT
I'LL TELL YOU THIS--

11:04.540 --> 11:06.792
SLICK McBURNEY NEVER
PITCHED AS GOOD,

11:06.959 --> 11:07.835
AND NOT ONE MAN
ON OUR TEAM

11:08.002 --> 11:10.129
COULD GET A HIT
OFF OF JEBEDIAH.

11:10.296 --> 11:11.922
WHAT IS UNUSUAL
ABOUT THAT?

11:12.089 --> 11:14.467
CAROLINE,
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.552
HERE. LET ME SEE
IF I HAVE THIS CENTERED.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.638
ALL RIGHT.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.640
HMM. NOT BAD.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.142
IT LOOKS GOOD.

11:23.309 --> 11:24.977
LOOKS SO GOOD,
I THINK I'LL WEAR IT
TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY.

11:25.144 --> 11:26.687
OH, CHARLES.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.105
WE GOT A PITCHER.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.113
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HIM.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.532
HE WAS REALLY
SOMETHING.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.577
BOY, HE SURE COULD
THROW THAT BALL.

11:41.744 --> 11:44.205
HE WENT LIKE THIS,
AND HE REARED WAY BACK,

11:44.372 --> 11:45.539
AND HE LIFTED HIS LEG UP
LIKE THIS,

11:45.706 --> 11:48.501
AND HE THREW
LIKE THIS'.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.920
HEY, YOU CUT
THAT OUT'.

11:51.087 --> 11:53.506
I'M ONLY SHOWING THEM
HOW MR. MUMFORT PITCHES.

11:53.672 --> 11:54.840
Hanson: I'VE BEEN
THINKING,

11:55.007 --> 11:56.467
AFTER WE BEAT
SLEEPY EYE,

11:56.634 --> 11:59.178
WE SHOULD TRY TO
SET UP GAMES WITH
OTHER TOWNS AROUND.

11:59.345 --> 12:00.346
I WOULDN'T GO
TOO FAST.

12:00.513 --> 12:01.806
WE HAVEN'T BEATEN
SLEEPY EYE YET.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.183
OH, COME NOW, CHARLES.
YOU'VE SEEN JEBEDIAH PITCH.

12:04.350 --> 12:05.518
HE'S ALL WE'VE
EVER NEEDED.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.103
Edwards: SPEAKING
OF OUR PITCHER...

12:07.269 --> 12:09.897
Charles: YEAH,
THERE HE IS'.

12:10.064 --> 12:11.982
Hanson: YOU TAKE
CARE OF THAT ARM.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.150
WE'RE COUNTING
ON YOU.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.693
GOING TO
NEED IT A WEEK
FROM TODAY.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.029
I'LL BE THERE.
COME ALONG, MARGARET.

12:17.196 --> 12:20.449
GOOD-BYE.
GOOD DAY, GENTLEMEN.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.368
EVERY TEAM
NEEDS A NAME,

12:22.535 --> 12:23.494
AND SINCE HANSON'S MILL

12:23.661 --> 12:26.122
HAS DONATED
THE BASEBALLS THIS YEAR,

12:26.288 --> 12:29.166
THE WALNUT GROVE MILLERS
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.168
THAT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT
NAME FOR THE TEAM.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.962
Reverend:
A TEAM NAME. YES.

12:33.129 --> 12:35.923
YOU KNOW, PERHAPS
SOMETHING BIBLICAL
WOULD BE MORE IN KEEPING,

12:36.090 --> 12:38.467
LIKE THE HEAVENLY HOSTS.

12:38.634 --> 12:39.385
WELL, AMEN TO THAT.

12:39.552 --> 12:40.469
I DON'T KNOW,
REVEREND.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.054
THE WALNUT GROVE
HEAVENLY HOSTS.

12:42.221 --> 12:44.348
THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT
OF LETTERS TO PUT
ON A UNIFORM.

12:44.515 --> 12:46.058
YEAH, I SUPPOSE.

12:46.225 --> 12:47.518
MY OLD TEAM WAS
CALLED THE MULLIGANS.

12:47.685 --> 12:48.686
Nels: HARRIET
LIKES "MERCHANTS."

12:48.853 --> 12:50.563
THAT SEEMS VERY
APPROPRIATE SINCE--

12:50.729 --> 12:53.441
IF IT AIN'T GONNA BE
THE MILLERS, IT AIN'T
GONNA BE THE MERCHANTS'.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.067
YOU GENTLEMEN
FIGURE OUT WHAT
THE TEAM NAME IS.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.861
I'M GOING TO
TAKE MY FAMILY HOME
TO SUNDAY DINNER.

12:57.027 --> 12:57.903
SEE YOU AT PRACTICE.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.196
WELL, THAT WAS
HIS NAME--MULLIGAN.

12:59.363 --> 13:00.990
SEE YOU LATER,
DOCTOR.

13:01.157 --> 13:02.074
WHOSE NAME?

13:02.241 --> 13:03.159
MY OLD COACH.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.410
OH.

13:07.705 --> 13:10.416
SIMPLE ENOUGH.
MULLIGAN. MULLIGANS.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.088
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

13:16.255 --> 13:20.009
OH, I JUST
STARTED THINKING
ABOUT IT, ABOUT...

13:20.176 --> 13:23.762
OLESON AND HANSON
AND DOC BAKER
AT CHURCH TODAY.

13:23.929 --> 13:24.805
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

13:24.972 --> 13:25.931
WELL, THEY WERE
ALL ARGUING

13:26.098 --> 13:27.349
ABOUT WHAT NAME TO
PICK FOR THE TEAM.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.393
EVEN THE REVEREND ALDEN
CAME UP WITH A NAME--

13:29.560 --> 13:32.271
THE WALNUT GROVE
HEAVENLY HOSTS.

13:32.438 --> 13:33.272
BY THE TIME
YOU FINISHED SEWING

13:33.439 --> 13:34.356
ALL THOSE LETTERS
ON MY SHIRT,

13:34.523 --> 13:36.025
THE GAME
WOULD BE OVER.

13:36.192 --> 13:37.651
I'M SURPRISED
AT THE REVEREND ALDEN,

13:37.818 --> 13:39.737
COMING UP WITH
A NAME LIKE THAT.

13:39.904 --> 13:41.780
THAT SEEMS
SACRILEGIOUS.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.115
NOT IF WE WIN.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.709
MORNING, MR. McBURNEY.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.586
THAT'S A MISTAKE,
OLESON.

13:55.753 --> 13:56.712
WHAT?

13:56.879 --> 13:59.298
BALL PLAYER SHOULD
NEVER TOUCH A BROOM.

13:59.465 --> 14:02.468
USES ALL
THE WRONG MUSCLES.

14:02.635 --> 14:04.470
RUINS THE SWING.

14:04.637 --> 14:05.763
OH.

14:05.930 --> 14:08.015
WELL, I NEVER
THOUGHT OF MYSELF
MUCH AS A HITTER.

14:08.182 --> 14:09.183
MORE A PITCHER.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.143
AH, YOU'RE PITCHING
AGAIN THIS YEAR?

14:11.310 --> 14:13.604
UH, NO.
OUTFIELD.

14:13.771 --> 14:15.898
THOUGHT I'D
GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE
A CHANCE THIS YEAR.

14:16.065 --> 14:17.816
WELL, I WOULDN'T
PUT MYSELF DOWN.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.818
I MEAN, I'VE SEEN YOU
WITH A BAT IN HAND,

14:19.985 --> 14:23.072
AND I FIGURE THIS JUST
MIGHT BE YOUR YEAR.

14:23.239 --> 14:24.657
MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.993
OUR FAMILY HAS ALWAYS
BEEN QUITE ATHLETIC,
MR. SLICK.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.370
IT'S McBURNEY.
OH.

14:29.537 --> 14:30.663
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.916
SLICK'S MY NAME,
AND BASEBALL'S MY GAME.

14:34.083 --> 14:37.461
BESIDES, I CAN SEE
THE LADY HAS
A VERY KEEN EYE,

14:37.628 --> 14:40.297
AND IF I MIGHT BE
SO BOLD AS TO SAY,

14:40.464 --> 14:42.508
VERY PRETTY EYES
AT THAT.

14:42.675 --> 14:45.052
OH'. WELL,
THANK YOU.

14:45.219 --> 14:46.720
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN WALNUT GROVE?

14:46.887 --> 14:48.013
GAME ISN'T
TILL SUNDAY.

14:48.180 --> 14:51.016
EXACTLY WHY
I CAME OVER.

14:51.183 --> 14:54.103
THE SLEEPY EYE FELLAS
KNOW HOW SENSITIVE
SOME FOLKS ARE

14:54.270 --> 14:56.689
ABOUT WAGERING
ON THE SABBATH,

14:56.855 --> 14:59.149
SO WE THOUGHT
THE SPORTSMEN IN TOWN

14:59.316 --> 15:02.695
MIGHT WANT TO GET
THEIR BETS DOWN
A LITTLE EARLY.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.363
BEGGING YOUR PARDON,
MA'AM.

15:04.530 --> 15:05.823
WELL, I...
I DON'T KNOW.

15:05.990 --> 15:07.866
OH, NELS.
NOW, YOU SAID YOURSELF

15:08.033 --> 15:09.618
THAT THE MERCHANTS HAVE
A VERY GOOD CHANCE

15:09.785 --> 15:11.870
OF WINNING THIS YEAR.
THE MERCHANTS?

15:12.037 --> 15:14.873
YES. THAT'S THE NAME
OF OUR TEAM HERE,

15:15.040 --> 15:17.876
MR. McBURNEY,
AFTER THE MERCANTILE.

15:18.043 --> 15:21.714
AH. 'TIS A NOBLE NAME
FOR A FINE TEAM.

15:21.880 --> 15:22.965
STILL,
I DON'T KNOW...

15:23.132 --> 15:27.219
NELS, THIS GENTLEMAN
HAS RIDDEN A LONG WAY.

15:27.386 --> 15:30.848
WHILE I NORMALLY DON'T
FAVOR WAGERING,

15:31.015 --> 15:32.516
STILL, I THINK
MR. McBURNEY HERE

15:32.683 --> 15:36.061
IS OFFERING US
A CHANCE FOR A VERY
GOOD INVESTMENT.

15:36.228 --> 15:37.896
A TRUE PATRON
OF THE SPORT.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.107
WON'T YOU COME INSIDE,
MR. McBURNEY?

15:40.274 --> 15:42.359
I WILL INDEED.

15:42.526 --> 15:43.777
HARRIET.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.446
JUST SWEEP, NELS.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.382
WELL, IT'S
ALWAYS GOOD

16:05.549 --> 16:07.092
DOING BUSINESS
WITH YOU, MR. HANSON.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.427
WELL, IT WAS
VERY NICE OF YOU

16:08.594 --> 16:10.220
TO COME OVER,
MR. McBURNEY.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.598
SEE YOU SUNDAY.
RIGHT.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.808
AND IT WOULD BE NICE
TAKING YOUR MONEY.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.102
[LAUGHS]
GOOD-BYE.

16:17.269 --> 16:18.520
GOOD SEEING YOU.

16:21.774 --> 16:23.025
WHAT'S McBURNEY
DOING AROUND HERE?

16:23.192 --> 16:25.611
OH, THE NERVE
OF THAT MRS. OLESON.

16:25.778 --> 16:27.112
MRS. OLESON?

16:27.279 --> 16:28.656
THE MERCHANTS, INDEED'.

16:28.822 --> 16:32.743
WELL, McBURNEY KNOWS NOW
THAT WE ARE WAGERING
ON THE MILLERS,

16:32.910 --> 16:34.953
NOT SOME
FOOL WOMAN'S NAME.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.372
YOU BET
ON WALNUT GROVE?

16:36.538 --> 16:38.123
JA, AND A LOT MORE
THAN THE OLESONS.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.668
CHARLES, I KNOW HOW
YOU FEEL ABOUT WAGERING,

16:40.834 --> 16:43.879
BUT, EDWARDS, I PUT DOWN
A DAY'S PAY FOR YOU.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.130
YOU MADE
A BET FOR ME?

16:45.297 --> 16:46.006
JA'.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.633
IT'S A MATTER
OF PRIDE'.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.386
A DAY'S WAGES.
THAT'S A LOT OF
PRIDE, ISN'T IT?

16:50.552 --> 16:52.137
THAT'S A WHOLE LOT
OF PRIDE.

16:52.304 --> 16:55.599
YOU MIGHT BE LUCKY.
HOW YOU GOING TO LOSE
WITH JEBEDIAH PITCHING?

16:55.766 --> 16:57.142
HEY, SAY,
YOU'RE RIGHT'.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.812
SAY, THERE, HANSON,
YOU THINK I GOT
TWO DAYS' COMING?

17:09.446 --> 17:12.616
YOU WAIT HERE, JEBEDIAH.
I WON'T BE LONG.

17:12.783 --> 17:14.159
4 DOZEN EVEN.

17:14.326 --> 17:18.330
MY, YOUR HENS APPEAR
TO BE LAYING VERY WELL
INDEED, MRS. INGALLS.

17:18.497 --> 17:21.834
THEY HAVE TO, WITH
THE PRICE OF EGGS
AS LOW AS IT IS.

17:22.000 --> 17:22.835
AH, GOOD MORNING,
MARGARET.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.336
GOOD MORNING.

17:24.503 --> 17:27.840
CAROLINE, I JUST LOVE
THE WORK CHARLES
DID ON MY ROCKER.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.425
YOU MUST BE
SO PROUD OF HIM.

17:29.591 --> 17:33.011
YES, I AM, BUT
YOU MUST BE EQUALLY
PROUD OF JEBEDIAH.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.179
CHARLES TELLS ME
HE'S GOING TO MAKE

17:34.346 --> 17:36.348
ALL OF WALNUT GROVE
PROUD ON SUNDAY.

17:36.515 --> 17:38.767
NOT TO MENTION
A GOOD DEAL RICHER,

17:38.934 --> 17:40.936
THAT IS, FOR THOSE OF US
WHO HAD THE COURAGE

17:41.103 --> 17:43.522
TO BACK
OUR CONFIDENCE
WITH OUR MONEY.

17:43.689 --> 17:44.982
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:45.149 --> 17:46.692
JEBEDIAH ISN'T
PLAYING FOR MONEY.

17:46.859 --> 17:49.361
NO, NO. I'M SPEAKING
OF THE WAGERS.

17:49.528 --> 17:53.031
IT'S AS GOOD AS
MONEY IN THE BANK,
THANKS TO YOUR HUSBAND.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.616
YOU MEAN...

17:54.783 --> 17:57.870
PEOPLE ARE BETTING
BECAUSE JEBEDIAH
IS PITCHING?

17:58.036 --> 17:59.121
YES.

17:59.288 --> 18:00.998
WELL, WALNUT GROVE
HAS A GOOD CHANCE
OF WINNING

18:01.165 --> 18:02.541
WITH JEBEDIAH
PITCHING.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.293
THEN I'M AFRAID
THEY'LL HAVE TO LOSE.

18:04.460 --> 18:08.255
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THAT SLICK McBURNEY'S
FACE WHEN JEB--

18:08.422 --> 18:09.506
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

18:09.673 --> 18:11.842
I WILL NOT ALLOW
JEBEDIAH TO TAKE PART

18:12.009 --> 18:14.470
IN ANY GAME
THAT ENCOURAGES GAMBLING'.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.930
BUT THE BETS HAVE
ALREADY BEEN MADE'.

18:17.097 --> 18:20.142
A SAD LESSON.
JEBEDIAH WILL NOT
BE PART OF IT'.

18:20.309 --> 18:21.894
NOW, MARGARET,
YOU KNOW I FEEL
THE SAME WAY

18:22.060 --> 18:23.353
ABOUT GAMBLING
THAT YOU DO--

18:23.520 --> 18:25.814
GOOD. I'M GLAD
SOMEONE DOES.

18:25.981 --> 18:27.399
MARGARET,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND'.

18:27.566 --> 18:28.859
I, MYSELF--

18:29.026 --> 18:32.488
HARRIET OLESON,
IT'S YOU WHO
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND'.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.783
JEBEDIAH WILL NOT PLAY'.
I WILL NOT ALLOW IT'.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.204
PLEASE CREDIT THE EGGS
TO MY ACCOUNT.

18:40.370 --> 18:44.625
I HAVE TO SPEAK
TO MY HUSBAND.

18:44.792 --> 18:47.711
TRUST I'LL SEE YOU LADIES
AT THE WOMEN'S LEAGUE
ON SATURDAY.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.213
GOOD DAY.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.464
GOOD DAY.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.176
[HUMMING]

19:04.353 --> 19:05.938
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
FOR LUNCH, ISN'T IT?

19:06.104 --> 19:09.274
THIS AIN'T LUNCH.
I'M BUILDING
MYSELF A MITTEN.

19:09.441 --> 19:10.400
DOC SAYS I OUGHT
TO HAVE ONE

19:10.567 --> 19:11.652
AFTER I HURT MY HAND
THE OTHER DAY.

19:11.819 --> 19:12.945
I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU HURT IT.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.197
YEAH. SWOLE UP
LIKE A MULE
STOMPED ON IT

19:15.364 --> 19:17.282
AFTER CATCHING
BASEBALLS
THE OTHER DAY.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.117
WELL, THAT LOOKS
PRETTY GOOD...

19:19.284 --> 19:20.661
AND IT SMELLS
PRETTY BAD.

19:20.828 --> 19:23.497
I PUT A SIDE
OF JERKY IN THERE,
TAKE THE STING OUT.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.290
GOING TO WORK
PRETTY GOOD, TOO.

19:25.457 --> 19:26.750
I'LL WAIT HERE,
JEBEDIAH.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.168
YOU GO TELL THEM.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.586
YES, MARGARET.

19:36.260 --> 19:38.804
GOOD MORNING,
JEBEDIAH.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.097
WISH IT WAS.

19:40.264 --> 19:41.807
Charles:
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

19:41.974 --> 19:45.894
I'D RATHER TAKE
A BEATING THAN SAY
WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAY.

19:46.061 --> 19:48.355
I AIN'T GONNA BE ABLE
TO PITCH SUNDAY.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.941
WELL, WHY?
WHAT, DID YOU
HURT YOURSELF?

19:51.108 --> 19:53.735
NO. MARGARET
WON'T LET ME PLAY.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.320
WHY NOT?

19:55.487 --> 19:59.575
WELL, YOUR WIFE CAROLINE
AND MRS. OLESON TOLD
ABOUT THAT GAMBLING.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.994
SHE'S PLUMB SET
AGAINST THOSE THINGS.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.829
OHH...

20:03.996 --> 20:05.497
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO.

20:05.664 --> 20:08.375
MAYBE IF I JUST GO
OVER THERE AND HAVE
A LITTLE TALK WITH HER.

20:08.542 --> 20:09.668
WELL, YOU'RE
WELCOME TO TRY.

20:09.835 --> 20:14.006
Margaret: JEBEDIAH,
COME ALONG.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.382
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

20:15.549 --> 20:17.050
WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD.

20:17.217 --> 20:20.220
SORRY, FELLAS. DIDN'T
MEAN TO LET YOU DOWN.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.513
WE UNDERSTAND.

20:25.017 --> 20:26.727
THERE GOES
THE BALL GAME.

20:26.894 --> 20:28.145
AND A DAY'S WAGES.

20:28.312 --> 20:29.313
TWO DAYS' WAGES.

20:29.479 --> 20:30.731
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
TWO DAYS' WAGES?

20:30.898 --> 20:32.024
YOU TOLD ME TO PUT
YOU DOWN FOR TWO'.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.233
NOW, DID I SAY THAT?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.027
YES'.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
LISTENING TO ME?

20:35.193 --> 20:36.445
I WON'T ANYMORE'.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.201
MIGHT AS WELL JUST
EAT MY MITTEN.

20:58.884 --> 21:00.010
WELL, YOU KNOW,
CHARLES,

21:00.177 --> 21:01.553
MAYBE MARGARET
IS RIGHT.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.474
IF THEY LOSE,
IT'LL TEACH EVERYBODY
TO STOP GAMBLING.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.559
IT'S A PRETTY
EXPENSIVE LESSON.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.354
WELL, THEN,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
CALL OFF THE GAME?

21:10.520 --> 21:11.813
WE COULDN'T DO THAT,
NOT WITH SLEEPY EYE.

21:11.980 --> 21:12.856
WE'D NEVER HEAR
THE END OF IT.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.566
I DON'T SEE WHY.

21:14.733 --> 21:19.071
EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY HAVE
A BETTER BASEBALL TEAM
THAN WE HAVE ANYWAY.

21:19.237 --> 21:20.906
CAROLINE, YOU
CERTAINLY HAVE A WAY
OF PUTTING THINGS.

21:23.033 --> 21:25.077
WELL, COME ON NOW.
TELL THE TRUTH.

21:25.243 --> 21:26.620
AREN'T YOU TIRED
OF LOSING?

21:26.787 --> 21:28.413
SURE WE ARE.
THAT'S JUST
THE POINT.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.623
IF WE COULD HAVE
BEATEN SLEEPY EYE
THIS YEAR,

21:29.790 --> 21:30.707
THE MEN COULD HAVE
QUIT WINNERS.

21:30.874 --> 21:32.250
WE COULD HAVE
HELD OUR HEADS UP.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.087
THIS WAY, YOU'LL NEVER
GET THEM TO QUIT,
NOT LOSERS.

21:35.253 --> 21:37.255
YOU MEAN,
IF THEY WIN SUNDAY,

21:37.422 --> 21:39.424
THEY MIGHT
GIVE UP THIS GAME?

21:39.591 --> 21:40.968
WELL,
I'M SURE OF IT.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.345
LITTLE CHANCE
OF THAT NOW
WITHOUT JEBEDIAH.

21:43.512 --> 21:46.264
YOU KNOW MARGARET
MUMFORT WHEN SHE'S
MADE UP HER MIND.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.016
YES, I KNOW.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.185
I GOT TO GET BACK
TO WORK. SEE YOU
AT THE HOUSE.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.436
BYE.

21:58.026 --> 22:00.237
Grace: THE MOTION WAS
MADE BY MRS. OLESON

22:00.404 --> 22:02.280
THAT WE MAKE CURTAINS
FOR THE CHURCH.

22:02.447 --> 22:03.532
FOLLOWING THE DISCUSSION

22:03.699 --> 22:06.118
OF THE PRICE OF YARD
GOODS AT THE MERCANTILE,

22:06.284 --> 22:09.121
THE MOTION WAS TABLED
FOR WANT OF A SECOND.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.164
THEN WE ADJOURNED.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.834
THANK YOU, GRACE.

22:14.001 --> 22:15.627
THE FLOOR
IS NOW OPEN.

22:15.794 --> 22:18.296
CAROLINE?
THANK YOU.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.465
I KNOW THAT
MANY OF YOU FEEL

22:20.632 --> 22:21.967
THAT THIS GAME WITH
SLEEPY EYE TOMORROW

22:22.134 --> 22:23.635
IS NOT A GOOD THING
FOR THE COMMUNITY--

22:23.802 --> 22:27.014
Margaret: GAMBLING
IS AN ABOMINATION
FOR ANY COMMUNITY.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.307
IT PROFITS NO ONE
BUT THE DEVIL.

22:29.474 --> 22:30.851
DON'T YOU AGREE,
REVEREND?

22:32.519 --> 22:34.688
WELL, NATURALLY,
I...

22:36.023 --> 22:39.735
I AGREE
THAT NORMALLY
THAT IS THE CASE,

22:39.901 --> 22:41.069
BUT...

22:41.236 --> 22:42.362
WELL, OUT OF HAND,

22:42.529 --> 22:44.698
I JUST WOULDN'T
WANT TO CONDEMN
ANYTHING--

22:44.865 --> 22:49.578
REVEREND, SUPPOSE
THE WINNINGS WERE DONATED
TO THE CHURCH FUND.

22:49.745 --> 22:51.329
WOULDN'T THAT PUT
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT LIGHT

22:51.496 --> 22:53.165
ON THE MATTER
OF THE WAGERS?

22:53.331 --> 22:55.083
WELL,
YES, CERTAINLY.

22:55.250 --> 22:59.004
MAY I REMIND YOU
THAT THAT'S OUR MONEY
YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT?

22:59.171 --> 23:02.966
MAY I REMIND YOU,
YOU WILL LOSE IT IF
JEBEDIAH DOESN'T PITCH?

23:03.133 --> 23:05.302
A HALF A LOAF
IS BETTER THAN NONE.

23:05.469 --> 23:07.304
FOR THAT REASON,
MARGARET,

23:07.471 --> 23:09.973
I FEEL THAT EVERYBODY
WOULD CONTRIBUTE
THEIR WINNINGS

23:10.140 --> 23:12.517
IF YOU WOULD ALLOW
JEBEDIAH TO PITCH.

23:14.853 --> 23:16.688
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S...

23:16.855 --> 23:19.441
IT'S NO DIFFERENT
THAN THE TURKEY RAFFLE.

23:19.608 --> 23:22.694
WE HOLD TURKEY RAFFLES
FOR THE CHURCH FUND,
DON'T WE?

23:22.861 --> 23:23.945
WELL...

23:26.198 --> 23:27.324
REVEREND?

23:28.450 --> 23:31.536
OH, MY, YES.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.872
YOU KNOW, THE LORD SEEMS
TO BE MOST CHARITABLE

23:34.039 --> 23:36.958
IN MATTERS LIKE THIS
WHEN IT'S FOR
A GOOD CAUSE,

23:37.125 --> 23:39.669
AND THE CHURCH FUND
IS A VERY FINE CAUSE.

23:42.130 --> 23:46.551
WELL, IF THE REST
OF YOU AGREE, I WON'T
STAND IN THE WAY.

23:46.718 --> 23:48.428
IF JEBEDIAH
WANTS TO PITCH,

23:48.595 --> 23:50.388
THEN HE HAS MY PERMISSION.

23:50.555 --> 23:51.723

WATCH OVER

HOW DID IT GO
IN THERE?

24:08.240 --> 24:10.075
JEBEDIAH'S GOING TO
PITCH ON SUNDAY.

24:10.242 --> 24:11.118
HEY, REVEREND
IT SOUNDS LIKE

24:11.284 --> 24:12.369
YOU HAD A MIRACLE
IN THERE.

24:12.536 --> 24:13.995
IT'S NOT MY
DOING, CHARLES.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.247
I MUST ADMIT
THAT I WAS
INSPIRED

24:15.413 --> 24:16.665
BY THE LADIES'
DECISION TO DONATE

24:16.832 --> 24:18.250
CURTAINS TO
THE BUILDING, BUT

24:18.416 --> 24:20.585
NOT THAT I CONDONE
WAGERING, MIND YOU,

24:20.752 --> 24:22.587
BUT THAT WAS AN
INSPIRED COMPROMISE

24:22.754 --> 24:24.256
YOU CAME UP WITH,
MRS. INGALLS.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.258
THANK YOU.
I JUST HOPE JEBEDIAH

24:26.424 --> 24:27.551
IS AS INSPIRED ON SUNDAY

24:27.717 --> 24:29.761
WHEN THE GREEN STOCKINGS
GET HERE.

24:29.928 --> 24:31.555
AMEN TO THAT.

WE ARE A TEAM,
