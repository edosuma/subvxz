00:13.560 --> 00:16.999
You were out late last night. Yes.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.879
I was at the club.
Did I disturb you?

00:19.880 --> 00:22.039
I heard you come in, but that's OK.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.839
Is this yours? Yes.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.439
When did you get it? Yesterday.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.519
Out partying, new phone,

00:30.520 --> 00:33.319
did you get a pay rise? Yes...

00:33.320 --> 00:35.919
something like that.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.320
I have to go. See you.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.879
Oh! Your phone!

00:41.880 --> 00:44.320
Not on the building site, security.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.560
Bye, Adam.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.679
It's a charity event. 54 miles.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.759
You've got to get sponsors.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.759
That's easy.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.479
Getting sponsors?

01:51.480 --> 01:53.600
54 miles.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.959
So, will you do it? Is it a race?

02:04.960 --> 02:07.279
No, it's not, it's for charity.

02:07.280 --> 02:11.079
It's boring. Why has everything
got to be competitive with you?

02:11.080 --> 02:12.599
It doesn't.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.000
Race you to the river.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.560
Come on, old man.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.799
Excuse me. Sorry.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.880
Excuse me, fellas.

I'm not going to share your bottle,
I don't know where it's been.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.960
OK.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.319
What's the charity?
You're not interested.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.960
I might be.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.280
Streatham Hospital.
It's where Leila works.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.799
Hi. Hi.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.560
Leila?

04:03.440 --> 04:06.039
Is she going to be there?

04:06.040 --> 04:08.159
Of course.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.759
Well, it is for a good... cause,

04:10.760 --> 04:12.719
a hospital. Yeah, I'll do it.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.479
You said you were busy. I can move
things around.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.559
Is this about helping the hospital
or is this about Leila? Oh.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.880
All right, calm down. All right?

04:23.440 --> 04:25.199
I might give her a call. Why?

04:25.200 --> 04:28.159
To enrol. She's not organising it,
she's just taking part.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.119
I might give her a call anyway.
What's her number?

04:31.120 --> 04:34.199
07779...

04:34.200 --> 04:36.679
325774. What?

04:36.680 --> 04:41.720
07779 3257... 44.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.680
You made that up. Well, I don't know
her number. I've forgotten it.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.359
I've got to get to work. See ya.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.720
See you tomorrow at the gym.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.999
This is quite a view. Thank you.
You've done very well for yourself.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.439
I could say the same for you,
Eleanor.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.399
Government intelligence, serious
fraud. Why have you asked me here?

05:11.400 --> 05:13.999
And always straight to the point.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.239
I've asked you to come to my home...
Because you're up to something

05:17.240 --> 05:19.959
you don't want anyone at Westminster
to know.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.399
I'd have invited you to lunch.
I wouldn't have accepted.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.119
You know very well we don't do lunch
at the SFO. Hmm.

05:25.120 --> 05:28.359
I do sometimes think you take
probity a little too far.

05:28.360 --> 05:32.319
I'm busy, Peter, so...
Charles Matherson.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.239
The minister? Hmm.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.440
Under-secretary of State for
Planning.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.919
'Very much a high-flyer.'

05:44.920 --> 05:46.159
Peter.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.599
'Spoken of as future PM.'

05:48.600 --> 05:54.879
Go on. It's not my place to tell the
SFO its business, but he's corrupt

05:54.880 --> 05:57.240
and I'd like you to nail him.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.119
In the past three years,

06:02.120 --> 06:04.879
Matherson has green lit two
skyscrapers,

06:04.880 --> 06:06.599
The Iron and The Fridge.

06:06.600 --> 06:11.039
This is the third. It's the biggest
yet, it's called The Scimitar.

06:11.040 --> 06:15.039
So, where's the problem?
The problem is...

06:15.040 --> 06:16.479
his wife.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.919
She has connections in the
construction industry.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.799
Her father owns a quarry in
Yorkshire

06:20.800 --> 06:22.759
supplying high-quality ragstone

06:22.760 --> 06:25.599
to each of the buildings Matherson
has approved.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.399
The Iron, The Fridge, The Scimitar.
Wait a minute.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.999
He's a minister for planning,
how can he do that?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.199
It's not him, it's not his wife,
it's his father-in-law.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.359
It's all... very transparent, but...

06:37.360 --> 06:39.719
Everyone was against
The Scimitar,

06:39.720 --> 06:42.159
English Heritage, the Royal Parks
Foundation,

06:42.160 --> 06:43.999
the Commission for Architecture.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.039
Half a million Londoners even signed
a petition to stop it being built,

06:47.040 --> 06:50.439
but he still managed to steer it through.
You think he's being bribed?

06:50.440 --> 06:53.080
Well, that's what I'm hoping you can
tell me.

06:54.360 --> 06:58.119
If he's being bribed, the money's
got to show up somewhere. Exactly.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.600
Are we taking this on?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.679
I don't know. What do you think?

07:04.680 --> 07:07.439
I hate these buildings.
London doesn't need 'em.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.919
80% of them are owned by foreign
investors.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.759
They buy 'em off plan in Singapore
and they never live in them.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.199
The whole thing's a racket.
That's not exactly the point.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.319
Well, that's just how I feel.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.199
Well, it's certainly worth some
initial scoping.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.479
We'll need to look into his private
life.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.480
I'll find a way in.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.920
Whoa!

07:57.240 --> 08:00.559
Hey, you two. You know what the rule
is on this site, yeah?

08:00.560 --> 08:02.280
English only.

08:04.600 --> 08:09.279
I told him about you. What, my name?
No, nothing. Good.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.279
But Gulliver, he's OK.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.559
He'll pay you the same.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.479
1,000? Yeah.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.200
If he gave you that,
it was worth more.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.080
All right?

08:49.120 --> 08:51.639
We should hang soon. When's good?

08:51.640 --> 08:53.240
Can't wait to see you, babe.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.959
Look, I know going through hundreds
of phones

08:58.960 --> 09:02.040
isn't the most exciting job, but
have you found anything yet?

09:03.560 --> 09:06.319
No, Sarge.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.040
There could be some useful intel on
these, you never know.

09:14.360 --> 09:18.159
Listen, er, I might have something
a bit different for you,

09:18.160 --> 09:20.239
if you're up for it?

09:20.240 --> 09:22.759
What's that? It's an undercover job.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.559
I need something collected.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.999
OK, it's hot, there's money involved

09:27.000 --> 09:29.439
and it'll affect the whole squad.
What do you think?

09:29.440 --> 09:31.320
Yes, Sarge.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.399
Two cappuccinos, two flat whites,

09:35.400 --> 09:37.439
three breakfast teas and a hot
chocolate.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.680
I want the change and bring back
a receipt, all right?

09:41.840 --> 09:44.560
Go on, then, get on with it.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.000
Le Nozze Di Figaro by Mozart

09:58.920 --> 10:01.599
I'm off. Where are you going?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.959
The Wesleys. Oh, God!

10:03.960 --> 10:06.519
I know. What is it this time?

10:06.520 --> 10:09.639
The launch of The Scimitar dressed
up as some sort of charity do.

10:09.640 --> 10:13.120
Art in prisons or something. Which
is where they'll probably end up.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.519
There's my driver now.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.559
Are you in tonight? I'm not moving.

10:18.560 --> 10:22.439
Dinner in front of the TV. Oh, God!
Lucky you.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.280
Mmm! I'll see you later.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.599
You're not my usual driver.
What's happened to Ivan?

10:34.600 --> 10:37.759
Ivan's not well, sir. They sent me.
Hmm. I'm very sorry to hear that.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.719
What's the matter with him?
They did not say, sir.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.839
They said he'd be away for two
weeks. It's a nuisance.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.199
What's your name? Stefan, sir.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.479
How long have you been with the car
service? Erm, six months.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.839
Hmm. I hope you know your way
around.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.479
I'm going to Parliament now,
then to the City Garden Space.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.799
Do you know it? It's in the satnav,
sir. Yes, of course.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.319
I, er, take it you know who I am?

11:00.320 --> 11:01.999
Yes, sir. Right.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.279
You never speed, you never go
through a yellow light,

11:04.280 --> 11:06.439
and if ever you keep me waiting,
even for a minute,

11:06.440 --> 11:09.320
I'll ask for a new driver. Is that
understood? Yes, sir. Good.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.359
Let's go.

11:13.360 --> 11:14.760
Oh.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.799
Adam?

12:04.800 --> 12:07.080
See you tonight. The Golabki. You're
buying.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.199
Listen, er, the lights have gone
down in Section One.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.679
You know, it's going to get dark
pretty soon.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.719
I need you to go and check the
generator. Now?

12:16.720 --> 12:19.479
Yeah, now. I mean, the rig's about
to arrive.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.359
Yeah, we're going to be drilling all
night.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.160
Well, crack on. Get on with it. OK.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.920
'The Scimitar.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.919
'A stunning new development set to
transform the London skyline.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.639

'London's most exciting landmark.'

14:13.280 --> 14:15.639
The City Garden Space, sir.

14:15.640 --> 14:19.160
All right, wait for me here. I
shouldn't be more than an hour.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.839
I'll let myself out.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.839
'Rising 250 metres above the city,

14:28.840 --> 14:34.959

14:43.920 --> 14:47.160
'be part of... The Scimitar.'

14:52.320 --> 14:54.839
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.879
We want to thank you all for being
here tonight,

14:56.880 --> 15:00.039
in particular our wonderful
architect Paolo.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.879
And, of course, the Under-secretary
of State, Charles Matherson.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.119
Thanks to the agreement reached
with the minister,

15:05.120 --> 15:08.079
The Scimitar will be making
a section 106 contribution

15:08.080 --> 15:11.799
of £16 million going to
the local community.

15:11.800 --> 15:15.199
Louis and I are determined that The
Scimitar should benefit all London

15:15.200 --> 15:18.040
and working with the government,
that's what we intend to achieve.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.519
I'm sorry, sir, I'm afraid this
venue's closed

15:30.520 --> 15:33.919
for a private function this evening.
I'd like to see the Wesleys.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.599
I'm sorry, I can't let you in if you're
not on the list. Listen, darling.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.319
Tell them John Gulliver is here.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.800
They'll see me.

15:43.040 --> 15:47.959
Just between you and me, I don't
like your snotty attitude, OK?

15:47.960 --> 15:51.879
So why don't you shove it -
along with your clipboard -

15:51.880 --> 15:54.600
and tell them that I'm here.
Let her go.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.439
Who are you?

16:01.440 --> 16:07.280
I'm a driver. Well, get back in your
car... and mind your own business.

16:08.440 --> 16:11.159
I'm OK. I don't want any trouble.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.719
You heard her, she's OK.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.359
There won't be any trouble,

16:16.360 --> 16:18.399
I just need to speak to him.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.439
But tonight isn't just about
The Scimitar,

16:21.440 --> 16:25.639
downstairs and all around us
you'll find original artwork

16:25.640 --> 16:30.119
created by young offenders under
our artistic licence scheme.

16:30.120 --> 16:34.760
It's all for sale. So, please,
dig deep and enjoy yourselves.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.240
Thanks for coming.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.680
Mr Wesley.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.720
What are you doing here?

17:03.920 --> 17:06.239
I gave you two days, I still haven't
heard from you.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.239
I needed to think about it. I wouldn't
say there was much to think about,

17:09.240 --> 17:11.960
unless you want all this to come
crashing down. Look...

17:13.680 --> 17:15.239
I'll pay.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.880
It will just take me time
to raise the money.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.920
Tell me where I can find you.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.159
Adam's dead.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.320
What?!

18:10.960 --> 18:12.760
He was killed on the site today.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.360
It was an accident.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.120
An accident?!

18:21.360 --> 18:23.520
That's what they say.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.359
Does anyone know? What?

18:28.360 --> 18:30.319
You know what I'm talking about.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.440
Did you tell them?

18:32.520 --> 18:34.879
No. You mustn't.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.800
Eva... Adam's dead.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.239
He sold it to them
and they killed him.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.359
I have to go to the police.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.080
No!

19:08.400 --> 19:10.159
Yeah.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.680
No, it's not a problem.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.560
Bye.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.279
Accident on a building site.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.639
Happened yesterday.

19:19.640 --> 19:23.079
Builder was killed when a generator
exploded in his face.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.359
Adam Jannsen? What's that, German?

19:26.360 --> 19:30.079
Polish, I think. Does it make any
difference?

19:30.080 --> 19:33.519
Not to him any more.
Anyway, it's a big deal.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.080
It's The Scimitar.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.319
You know, maybe you should read
the papers a bit more, Derek.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.039
It's a £500 million development.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.839
It's controversial - it's got
government backing, anyway.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.759
Press are all over it, that's
why it's been passed up to us.

19:47.760 --> 19:51.079
What about Health and Safety?
No, they've been told to wait.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.679
I want you to go down there and
make a preliminary report.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.999
And take Sayyad with you.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.119
Why? Cos he's a TDC, Derek.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.119
"T" stands for trainee,

20:02.120 --> 20:06.320
not something you send him out to
buy, all right?

20:08.880 --> 20:11.160
Right, come on.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.480
Get your coat.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.079
The new building known as
The Scimitar

20:23.080 --> 20:27.119
has been controversial since it was
given the go-ahead earlier this year.

20:27.120 --> 20:31.239
'Police and health and safety officials
have closed down the entire project

20:31.240 --> 20:34.600
'following the death of an unnamed
construction worker yesterday.'

20:35.920 --> 20:38.000
Where's the foreman? In the office.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.839
Well, well, well!

20:51.840 --> 20:53.839
Raymond Keane!

20:53.840 --> 20:57.559
I've not seen you in a while.
Hi, Derek.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.799
You work here, do ya? Yeah.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.599
Site foreman.
Wonders will never cease.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.320
So, what happened?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.279
It was an accident.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.720
Checked the generator and...

21:13.120 --> 21:15.399
..the thing just blew.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.240
His bad luck, eh?

21:18.560 --> 21:21.280
Let's have a look, shall we?

21:23.040 --> 21:26.519
We had a power short, so I sent
Jannsen to look at the generator.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.759
You sent him? He was the first
person I saw. I hardly knew him.

21:29.760 --> 21:32.359
From Adam, yeah. So, what happened?

21:32.360 --> 21:34.920
I dunno. I think there was a leak
in the tank.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.600
No-one had been near it for days.

21:39.960 --> 21:43.960
I haven't a clue. Just like old
times, eh?

21:57.320 --> 22:00.679
Was anyone else here?
No, he was on his own.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.440
Sarge.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.959
There's chewing gum.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.400
That could've been left there a week
ago.

22:12.280 --> 22:15.559
Looks fresh. And there's boot prints
around the fuel tanker.

22:15.560 --> 22:19.639
Right. Some of the lads came over,
you know, after it happened.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.960
It was probably one of them.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.639
'There will, I'm sure, be a full
investigation

22:35.640 --> 22:38.439
'by the police and the Health and
Safety Executive.

22:38.440 --> 22:43.159
'But we cannot allow an accident
like this, albeit a tragic one,

22:43.160 --> 22:45.119
'to distract us.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.919
'Minister, how do you feel about

22:46.920 --> 22:49.919
'the opposition to The Scimitar both
local and national?'

22:49.920 --> 22:51.839
Louis, have you seen this? Shh.

22:51.840 --> 22:56.399
'My thoughts are with the family and
friends of the man who was sadly killed.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.800
'But I would like to say this.
We need...'

23:00.400 --> 23:01.839
We're all over the news.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.479
Yes, I've seen.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.159
It's terrible. I tell you what's
terrible, Elias,

23:07.160 --> 23:08.879
we've just been shut down.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.359
There'll be a full investigation
by HSE,

23:11.360 --> 23:14.960
prohibition notices, God knows!

23:16.840 --> 23:19.839
Why did he have to die on the bloody
building site?

23:19.840 --> 23:22.319
He could have... fallen under a bus,

23:22.320 --> 23:25.240
hr could've been knocked down
by a train. Louis!

23:27.360 --> 23:30.200
It's just a bloody shame,
that's all.

23:34.440 --> 23:38.519
Yes? I understand you have an
Adam Jannsen living here?

23:38.520 --> 23:41.119
That's right. Your name is?

23:41.120 --> 23:42.639
Karen Andrews.

23:42.640 --> 23:46.399
I'm Detective Sergeant Sands, this
is Detective Constable Sayyad.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.199
Can we come in?
It's not a good time.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.519
Not for Adam, not for us, not for
anybody, really,

23:52.520 --> 23:54.280
but we'd still like to come in.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.639
It's my house.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.879
Adam's been renting a room from me
for the last three months.

23:59.880 --> 24:03.039
So how did the two of you meet?
Internet.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.839
There's a renting agency.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
But he just walked through the door.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.119
So what can you tell us about Adam?

24:12.120 --> 24:18.119
He was very quiet, very
hard-working, he didn't go out much.

24:18.120 --> 24:23.239
So, nothing unusual's happened over
the last few days, weeks?

24:23.240 --> 24:26.239
Apart from Adam getting himself
killed, I mean.

24:26.240 --> 24:30.279
He didn't say or do anything
that made you think twice?

24:30.280 --> 24:33.639
No. Are you suggesting...? I'm not
suggesting anything, Ms Andrews,

24:33.640 --> 24:35.439
I'm just asking you some questions,

24:35.440 --> 24:38.080
and if you could answer them,
that'd be a real help.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.879
I didn't see that much of him.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.520
He seemed completely normal.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.079
In fact, he was very cheerful.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.319
He'd made some money.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.559
That's his. He'd just bought it.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.319
Er, did he tell you
HOW he made the money?

24:55.320 --> 24:56.959
No. He must've done another job.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.160
Moonlighting. He never stopped.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.919
It was an accident. A piece of kit
that should have been inspected.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.879
Poor bastard turned it on
and it blew him apart.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.919
Let's leave it to Health and Safety.
I don't agree.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.919
Er, excuse me, who asked you?

25:11.920 --> 25:14.159
Adam Jannsen was a casual labourer,

25:14.160 --> 25:16.279
no record here or abroad,

25:16.280 --> 25:18.679
wife, daughter, no enemies, nothing.

25:18.680 --> 25:22.039
You ran into Raymond Keane? Yes.
He was your informant, wasn't he?

25:22.040 --> 25:24.519
On and off back in the '90s, then
he disappeared.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.759
Are you going to talk to him?

25:25.760 --> 25:29.759
I might, but he doesn't know anything, he was
nowhere near the generator when it happened.

25:29.760 --> 25:32.479
Adam Jannsen made money the week
before he died. Moonlighting.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.160
And there may have been someone
there when it happened.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.279
I found chewing gum.

25:38.280 --> 25:42.319
I know it's not much, but when I
mentioned it, Keane looked nervous.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.799
All right. Talk to Keane again.

25:44.800 --> 25:48.399
But I think you're right, let's leave this
to HSE unless something else comes up.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.319
And you... don't argue with your
senior officer,

25:51.320 --> 25:53.600
especially not in front of me.

26:00.040 --> 26:03.239
Why am I doing this? Muay Thai.

26:03.240 --> 26:06.479
Thai boxing. Yeah, I know what it
is, why am I doing it?

26:06.480 --> 26:10.439
Well, it's good for leg strength,
core muscles,

26:10.440 --> 26:14.159
cardiovascular, and it helps you
de-stress.

26:14.160 --> 26:18.759
He was a builder, a general
labourer. His name was Adam Jannsen.

26:18.760 --> 26:22.159
They're saying it was an accident,
but I'm not so sure.

26:22.160 --> 26:25.959
Where was he from? Er... Bizgozca.

26:25.960 --> 26:30.079
Hmm. Bydgoszcz. All right, somewhere
with two Zs in it.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.799
Bydgoszcz. What, you been there?

26:33.800 --> 26:35.799
No, I just know how to pronounce it.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.440
Five. Six.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.560
Six. That was seven!

26:44.280 --> 26:46.559
Seven. Eight!

26:46.560 --> 26:48.399
So, what you doing?

26:48.400 --> 26:51.559
Can't tell ya.
You always say that.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.999
It is really annoying.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.480
Look, it's SF0 business. You can
tell me because we're mates.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.919
I'm not interested anyway.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.519
Look, I need your help. Adam was
Polish, he has a mate who's Polish.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.200
You know these people.

27:08.920 --> 27:12.159
What, because I'm... Polish?

27:12.160 --> 27:14.839
That's racist. No, it's not.

27:14.840 --> 27:18.320
Yes, it is. How is that possibly
racist?

27:20.800 --> 27:22.759
I'm amazed you've never done this
before.

27:22.760 --> 27:26.159
I didn't want to do it before. I
don't think I want to do it now.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.239
Charles Matherson.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.839
Who's Charles Matherson?

27:29.840 --> 27:33.599
What's the point of telling if you don't even
know who he is? Just tell me! He's a big shot.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.519
He's in government.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.040
I'm his driver.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.480
You're driving him?
It's what I do.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.120
Well, that's cool. Do you have to
wear a cap?

27:48.800 --> 27:51.279
Yeah, just... keep going.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.720
Relax.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.879
You ready?

27:58.880 --> 28:03.719
Yeah. OK. We can do something
fairly basic just to start with.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.239
All right.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.920
Hah!

28:15.120 --> 28:19.039
I'm sorry. You kicked me...
in the balls.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.680
It wasn't a kick, it was dechang.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.559
You should learn it, you don't know
when you might need it.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.640
I don't need it, in any sense.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.199
I've got to get home. Me, too.

28:32.200 --> 28:36.280
I've got an early start. Are you
seeing any... more flats?

28:37.920 --> 28:40.239
Perhaps.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.640
Yeah? Yeah.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.079
Actually, I saw one today.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.159
I wasn't looking, but I stumbled on
a room to rent.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.439
Nice house.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.159
Owned by a girl.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.640
Are you... going to take it?

28:59.920 --> 29:01.760
It's complicated.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.320
I haven't asked.

29:06.560 --> 29:09.359
You shouldn't rent, you should buy.

29:09.360 --> 29:12.319
I can't afford to buy,
not in London.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.919
We could go halves. We still
couldn't afford it.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.479
Besides, I'm not sure it's a good
idea.

29:17.480 --> 29:21.999
Why not? Well, I hardly even know
you. Anyway...

29:22.000 --> 29:24.479
What?! You just kicked me!

29:24.480 --> 29:27.719
Oh... I said I was sorry.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.679
Yeah.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.079
Well, it's not exactly a
recommendation.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.240
Oh, erm...

29:35.520 --> 29:37.119
..see you, then.

29:37.120 --> 29:40.160
See ya. Say hello to Leila for me.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.519
So... you live here, do you?

29:46.520 --> 29:49.159
I have a bedsit on the top floor.

29:49.160 --> 29:52.879
You don't drink? I gave it up.

29:52.880 --> 29:56.919
Booze is what got me into trouble
in the first place.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.919
You were a... alcoholic?

30:00.920 --> 30:04.919
Shoplifting in an off-licence, that
was the first time I got nicked.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.999
I thought I was your first time?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.959
No, you were the first one who put
me inside.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.999
So where have you been all these
years? Back up north.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.519
You know, Manchester, Leeds.

30:15.520 --> 30:16.959
I needed to work.

30:16.960 --> 30:20.920
I gave you work. Yeah,
but I moved on.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.879
How's Eda? How's the kids?

30:26.880 --> 30:29.040
They moved on too.

30:30.440 --> 30:31.720
I'm sorry.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.039
So this business with Jannsen?

30:37.040 --> 30:40.080
What happened, Raymond,
at the building site?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.840
It was an accident.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.719
Why would I lie to ya?
I didn't even know the guy.

30:49.720 --> 30:54.119
You sent him over there. He was in
the wrong place, wrong time.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.360
It was just bad luck.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.759
Oh, I was just about to leave for
work. Can I just talk to you?

31:13.760 --> 31:15.520
It'll only be a few minutes.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.639
This really is a nice place.
Thank you.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.519
Will you be renting the room again?

31:26.520 --> 31:28.799
I haven't really thought about it.

31:28.800 --> 31:31.719
Why do you ask? Oh, I just wondered.

31:31.720 --> 31:35.319
I suppose I'll have to. I mean,
I can't afford not to.

31:35.320 --> 31:38.120
Anyway, what do you want to know?

31:39.440 --> 31:42.559
Is there anything else you can
tell me about Adam?

31:42.560 --> 31:44.239
Erm...

31:44.240 --> 31:48.159
did you know any of his friends?
They were mainly Eastern European.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.599
Polish.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.719
If you want to talk to them,
they'll be at the Golabki.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.079
What's that? It's a club.

31:56.080 --> 32:00.079
They're having drinks in his memory
tonight at nine.

32:00.080 --> 32:05.159
Look, you said he earned extra cash
moonlighting? That's right.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.039
Do you know how much cash?

32:07.040 --> 32:10.559
Well, he'd paid two months rent
in advance.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.679
How much was that? £800.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.359
That's good value.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.560
I might put it up. No.

32:18.720 --> 32:22.360
Er, that's... Yeah, that's about
right. Yeah.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.919
I know I said he was moonlighting,

32:25.920 --> 32:29.199
but now that I think about it,
I don't think he had the time.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.199
Er, well, did he gamble?

32:31.200 --> 32:34.759
Or could he have sold something
or borrowed the money?

32:34.760 --> 32:36.599
There's one thing.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.679
A few days before he died,

32:38.680 --> 32:40.600
he went to see someone.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.999
An antiques dealer.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.319
His name was Gulliver.

32:45.320 --> 32:48.239
How do you know that? He asked me
about the spelling.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.520
He Googled the address.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.359
This was his?

32:55.360 --> 32:58.080
I'll need to take it as evidence.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.119
Stefan, would you do me a favour?

33:17.120 --> 33:20.719
There's a box in the boot that weighs a
ton, do you think you could bring it in?

33:20.720 --> 33:24.120
Yes, sir, is pleasure.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.959
I'm just going to be ten minutes
and then straight to Westminster.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.759
And this afternoon my wife needs to
go to King's Cross station.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.679
Have you met her? No, sir.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.800
I'll introduce you.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.280
Just put it down there.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.520
Call the boss. We've got company.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.879
Helen?

34:05.880 --> 34:08.079
I wasn't expecting you.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.998
Just looking in on my way to B&Q's
and dropped off those samples.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.480
Thank you.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.639
HI-YAH!

34:59.640 --> 35:01.360
Can I help you?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.039
Would you mind putting that
down?

35:05.040 --> 35:07.600
It's not a toy and it's expensive.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.599
Were you looking for anything
in particular?

35:11.600 --> 35:14.560
Actually, I'm a police officer.

35:16.320 --> 35:19.799
I'm making enquiries about a man
called Adam Jannsen.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.479
Do you remember him?

35:21.480 --> 35:24.759
Why would I remember him
when I have never met him?

35:24.760 --> 35:26.999
He had your address on his phone.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.320
So what?

35:30.360 --> 35:33.799
When he left here,
he had money in his pocket.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.399
I think he sold something to you.

35:35.400 --> 35:39.039
I don't buy from the public,
only from people I know.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.920
So, why are you wasting my time?

35:44.320 --> 35:46.359
Three days later he was dead.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.039
My heart bleeds.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.200
People die all the time,
even policemen.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.119
Are you threatening me?

35:55.120 --> 35:56.920
Everything all right, John?

35:58.080 --> 36:00.439
I don't know, JC.

36:00.440 --> 36:01.600
Maybe.

36:02.840 --> 36:05.159
Maybe not.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.320
You were just leaving, weren't you?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.160
All right.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.239
You weren't worried last night,
were you? What?

36:28.240 --> 36:31.879
The Wesleys.
Do you think they've got problems?

36:31.880 --> 36:34.959
Well, they've borrowed through
the roof at the worst possible time.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.519
And now they've put all their eggs
in one very rickety basket.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.639
You're not telling me they're
going under?

36:40.640 --> 36:42.759
I very much hope not, Charles.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.640
I never wanted to do business
with them in the first place.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.079
OK...

37:23.080 --> 37:26.040
Good dog. Good dog.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.680
Good dog.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.520
Shhh, good dog.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.560
Good dog.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.680
Argh!

38:14.560 --> 38:16.079
Who's that?

38:16.080 --> 38:18.160
The driver.

38:19.360 --> 38:20.920
Oi, you!

38:22.560 --> 38:24.360
Stop!

38:30.360 --> 38:32.080
Stop!

38:35.080 --> 38:37.119
Stop! Stop it right there.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.960
We're police officers.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.079
Max! Max, get off him!

38:47.080 --> 38:48.119
Get out!

38:48.120 --> 38:49.879
Are you all right?

38:49.880 --> 38:51.959
No, sir, I'm hurt.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.319
Can you get up?
No, the dog bite me.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.559
Well, what are you doing in here?
I look for Mrs Matherson, you say.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.319
Oh, God. Helen.
Helen!

39:00.320 --> 39:01.959
Listen, don't move.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.800
I'll call an ambulance.
Helen!

39:07.960 --> 39:10.079
Did Max bite him? Yes.

39:10.080 --> 39:13.239
He was in the office.
What was he doing in there?

39:13.240 --> 39:14.599
I've no idea.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.720
I mean, he said he was looking
for you.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.159
Listen, I'm going
to call an ambulance.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.160
Put the dog outside.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.719
Good news from the doctors...

39:41.720 --> 39:43.239
the dog's going to be fine.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.560
Do you think that's funny?
It bit me.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.880
Leila?
How are you feeling?

39:52.040 --> 39:53.399
Better.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.160
You two know each other?

39:57.960 --> 39:59.920
Well, I'd better leave.

40:01.720 --> 40:05.279
You did really well, Stefan.
This is amazing.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.760
It could give us everything
we need to know.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.559
So...

40:12.560 --> 40:15.519
You're pretending to be a chauffeur?

40:15.520 --> 40:19.399
Get bitten by a dog,
you steal a memory stick.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.799
I won't ask.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.239
You want to go out tonight?

40:23.240 --> 40:25.720
I'm working tonight.
Well, tomorrow, then.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.159
How did you know I was here?
The doctor told me.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.999
Actually, I've got something
for you.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.439
What's that?

40:35.440 --> 40:36.840
This.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.479
We've had John Gulliver under
24-hour surveillance for the last

40:41.480 --> 40:45.159
three weeks and all was going very
nicely until your boy walked in.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.919
How did you know he was with us?

40:46.920 --> 40:49.799
I was in the building a couple of
days ago, saw him by the stairs.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.639
And then you decided to pick him
up before he did any more damage,

40:52.640 --> 40:54.039
was that the idea?

40:54.040 --> 40:55.839
I wanted to know what
he was doing there.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.319
I think we're all of that
persuasion.

40:58.320 --> 41:01.880
If you don't mind my asking,
what's your interest in Gulliver?

41:03.560 --> 41:05.320
Public sculptures.

41:06.720 --> 41:09.719
Three of them have been
stolen from different London

41:09.720 --> 41:11.520
parks in the past three months.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.759
We've been getting nowhere, until
last week.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.360
There was a witness.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.520
Excuse me,
can I ask what you're doing?

41:25.960 --> 41:27.839
Did he see the van?

41:27.840 --> 41:29.960
Yeah, and he got the registration.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.799
And that didn't help?

41:33.800 --> 41:37.079
Well, it helped us trace the vehicle
back to the company that rented it.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.040
4 Boys Van Hire. As far as it went.

41:40.360 --> 41:43.879
It's a cowboy operation -
cash on the counter and off you go.

41:43.880 --> 41:46.199
They gave us descriptions of the two
men who hired it,

41:46.200 --> 41:49.199
could have been anyone.
So, where's the van?

41:49.200 --> 41:50.719
Forensics, nothing so far.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.119
And Gulliver?

41:52.120 --> 41:54.399
Gulliver's a handler,
he's well known to us.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.319
A lot of stuff goes in and out of
that place.

41:56.320 --> 41:59.479
And you're waiting
for your statues to turn up.

41:59.480 --> 42:01.759
That was the idea.

42:01.760 --> 42:04.599
He doesn't know anything about
your investigation, all right?

42:04.600 --> 42:06.439
That wasn't why I was there.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.040
So, why were you there?

42:10.520 --> 42:13.439
Adam Jannsen visited Gulliver
three days before he died.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.039
Oh, come on!

42:15.040 --> 42:18.719
Jannsen, the construction worker?
His death is officially an accident.

42:18.720 --> 42:20.879
I think he sold something to
Gulliver.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.800
He was paid money, then he died.

42:24.120 --> 42:25.799
So, how did you find Gulliver?

42:25.800 --> 42:28.119
It was in Adam's phone,
he Googled the address.

42:28.120 --> 42:30.279
Why did you run? Someone came
chasing after me -

42:30.280 --> 42:32.719
I thought he was with Gulliver.
Yeah, that was my DC.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.519
Now he's out of action with
a concussion.

42:34.520 --> 42:37.159
He's meant to have an observation
post tonight watching.

42:37.160 --> 42:38.479
Gulliver midnight until six.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.919
Well, you've got cameras,
haven't you? Yeah.

42:40.920 --> 42:43.759
But they've been unreliable.
I need someone there.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.880
Thanks to him, I've got no-one.

42:54.520 --> 42:56.679
Maybe I can help.

42:56.680 --> 43:00.239
We're still processing the document
Stefan recovered from Mathersons',

43:00.240 --> 43:03.599
but, so far, everything is in the
wife's name - including the house.

43:03.600 --> 43:06.239
She paid £3.5 million for it
nine years ago.

43:06.240 --> 43:08.479
But it's worth at least twice that
now.

43:08.480 --> 43:11.639
So, she's the wealthy one, not him.
What else?

43:11.640 --> 43:14.199
Creighton Quarries is very
successful.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.879
That's the family business
run by her father.

43:16.880 --> 43:20.839
The ragstone is a premium product
and it costs a fortune.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.479
What have you got on Matherson?

43:22.480 --> 43:24.279
He has his ministerial salary,

43:24.280 --> 43:27.759
£134,565 a year, but that's it.

43:27.760 --> 43:30.679
One bank account, no unusual
transactions.

43:30.680 --> 43:34.039
So, there's no evidence of anything
untoward?

43:34.040 --> 43:36.519
I'm beginning to wonder
if this is worth pursuing.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.079
The corrupt minister?

43:38.080 --> 43:40.280
Well, only according to
Peter Mayhew.

43:41.760 --> 43:45.119
This came from Mayhew?
Why so surprised?

43:45.120 --> 43:46.599
Well, he's in government.

43:46.600 --> 43:48.999
Why would he brief against one
of his own ministers?

43:49.000 --> 43:50.559
That's a good point.

43:50.560 --> 43:53.279
I've been asking myself the exact
same question.

43:53.280 --> 43:54.880
Is he using us?

43:55.920 --> 43:58.040
And if so, why?

44:08.200 --> 44:09.760
Alison.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.760
What an unexpected pleasure.

44:18.800 --> 44:20.360
Would you care to join me?

44:22.280 --> 44:24.680
I want to ask you about
Charles Matherson.

44:26.920 --> 44:29.519
What do you want to know?

44:29.520 --> 44:31.399
Why are you so interested in him?

44:31.400 --> 44:33.719
Do you really think he's corrupt?

44:33.720 --> 44:36.759
Do you think I would have
gone to the SFO if I didn't?

44:36.760 --> 44:39.199
How are you getting on?
What were your sources?

44:39.200 --> 44:40.879
Well, common-sense.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.999
He's selling large quantities
of ragstone to the very developers

44:44.000 --> 44:47.119
he's helping.
That's his father-in-law.

44:47.120 --> 44:50.480
I think you'll find the business
is now run by his wife.

44:51.880 --> 44:53.439
Since when?

44:53.440 --> 44:55.760
Since the father-in-law
got dementia.

44:58.640 --> 45:01.359
I hadn't seen that.

45:01.360 --> 45:02.799
Well, glad to help.

45:02.800 --> 45:05.039
Why are you really giving this
to us, Uncle Peter?

45:05.040 --> 45:07.319
What is it that you want?

45:07.320 --> 45:08.720
Justice.

45:09.760 --> 45:11.280
The same as you.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.319
He's a Polish labourer.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.519
How it happened is still
a complete mystery.

45:16.520 --> 45:18.559
I feel so sorry for you,

45:18.560 --> 45:21.719
it must be the last thing you
want on your plate right now.

45:21.720 --> 45:24.239
We've got HSE all over us.

45:24.240 --> 45:27.519
It could set us back two,
maybe three weeks.

45:27.520 --> 45:30.719
Which may slightly affect
our business with you.

45:30.720 --> 45:33.719
There can't be any question
of a delay, Louis.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.119
The order's already been
confirmed.

45:36.120 --> 45:37.760
I'm afraid the boat's already left.

45:39.160 --> 45:40.559
It was just a thought.

45:40.560 --> 45:42.919
As they say, you might have cut us
a little slack.

45:42.920 --> 45:44.679
Actually, now that I've taken over,

45:44.680 --> 45:48.600
that's exactly the sort of business
practice we're trying to avoid.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.800
Yeah, I'm going to be late tonight.

46:06.080 --> 46:07.639
Ooh, sorry.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.360
Hey, this is Carrie.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.599
Hello?

46:13.600 --> 46:15.319
Yeah, I've got an OP.

46:15.320 --> 46:17.719
Rash said some of Adam's friends
don't speak English,

46:17.720 --> 46:19.279
so he brought me with him.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.080
You're Polish?
Yeah, I was born there.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.399
Hey, I've got to tell you,
I can't stay long.

46:26.400 --> 46:29.559
Why not?
I'm working.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.999
Well, just a quick drink.
No, no, no.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.919
No drink.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.960
You want these people to talk
to you, you drink with them.

46:37.880 --> 46:39.320
He's right.

46:59.280 --> 47:02.280
Over there.
I saw him at the building site.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.480
He worked with Adam.

47:06.520 --> 47:08.519
Great. I'll get the beers.

47:08.520 --> 47:11.280
Didn't you hear me?
Just sit down and translate.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.119
He didn't know him.

47:18.120 --> 47:20.879
They just worked together.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.360
Oh, well, then why
have you come here tonight?

47:36.640 --> 47:38.880
They don't want to talk to you.

47:41.920 --> 47:44.800
Well, do they want to be
arrested for obstruction?

47:56.760 --> 47:58.439
He wants to be arrested?

47:58.440 --> 48:00.240
He wants to talk.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.280
All right.

48:06.680 --> 48:10.159
He wants a drink first, though.
No, I can't drink.

48:10.160 --> 48:13.039
I've got to keep a clear head.
Why?

48:13.040 --> 48:16.159
Cos I'm working.
I've got an OP.

48:16.160 --> 48:19.359
When do you start?
Midnight.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.999
Well, you've still got time.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.920
You don't want to offend these guys.

48:26.280 --> 48:28.320
All right, just the one.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.080
Cheers! Cheers.

48:45.280 --> 48:48.039
What was that stuff?
Rekty spirit.

48:48.040 --> 48:49.679
What does that mean?

48:49.680 --> 48:50.840
95%.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.560
Did you know that?

48:55.000 --> 48:56.280
I didn't know.

48:58.560 --> 49:00.280
Coffee!

49:06.720 --> 49:08.879
I want to come with you.

49:08.880 --> 49:10.959
I'm your mate.

49:10.960 --> 49:14.680
I'm going to be there with you.
All night.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.200
I don't want you there.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.120
This is boring.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.679
Nothing's happening.

49:25.680 --> 49:28.000
We've only been here five minutes.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.679
Your job is rubbish.

49:31.680 --> 49:34.480
Then just... go.

49:35.680 --> 49:37.119
If I go,

49:37.120 --> 49:38.439
you'll fall asleep.

49:38.440 --> 49:39.839
Mm.

49:39.840 --> 49:41.919
Thanks to you.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.360
You didn't have to drink it.

49:45.680 --> 49:47.960
If Heywood finds out about this...

49:49.080 --> 49:51.160
..I'm finished.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.919
Wake up!

49:54.920 --> 49:57.079
I wasn't asleep.
You were asleep.

49:57.080 --> 49:58.719
No, I was resting my eyes.

49:58.720 --> 50:00.240
Then what was I saying?

50:02.040 --> 50:03.600
I wasn't listening.

50:12.880 --> 50:15.519
You go first.

50:15.520 --> 50:17.120
You have the first sleep.

50:20.040 --> 50:24.080
I'm not going to sleep.

50:52.560 --> 50:53.959
Evening.

50:53.960 --> 50:55.719
You're late.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.520
Yeah, sorry.

51:01.120 --> 51:02.879
This your place, then?

51:02.880 --> 51:04.920
Yes, it's my name above the door.

51:07.240 --> 51:10.039
How much would something like this
set me back?

51:10.040 --> 51:11.480
4,000.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.599
4,000?

51:14.600 --> 51:15.680
Quid?

51:17.360 --> 51:18.959
You're not serious.

51:18.960 --> 51:20.880
It's neoclassical.

51:23.640 --> 51:26.159
I don't suppose you know
what that means.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.920
No, you're right.

51:29.200 --> 51:30.799
I don't.

51:30.800 --> 51:33.639
So, why don't you give me what
I want and you can get out of here?

51:33.640 --> 51:35.800
Well, I've got to see it first.

51:57.480 --> 51:59.840
That's it?
Yes.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.560
Great.

52:08.720 --> 52:10.400
Neoclassical...

52:48.480 --> 52:50.359
All right, you bastard.

52:50.360 --> 52:53.040
You've made your point.

52:54.520 --> 52:56.920
You can have it for nothing
and piss off.

52:58.440 --> 53:00.839
Afraid not, mate.

53:00.840 --> 53:03.040
They're not my instructions.

53:04.280 --> 53:06.399
No-one likes being blackmailed.

53:06.400 --> 53:08.960
I wasn't blackmailing anyone.

53:11.080 --> 53:14.039
Well, that's not how they see it.

53:14.040 --> 53:16.239
I told people about what
I was doing.

53:16.240 --> 53:18.919
People know.

53:18.920 --> 53:21.199
Your word against ours, isn't it?

53:21.200 --> 53:23.519
And you're not going to be
talking to anyone.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.599
Wait!

53:25.600 --> 53:27.799
You're making a mistake.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.600
There are two of them.

53:30.840 --> 53:32.400
What?

53:33.600 --> 53:35.959
What you came for, Jannsen had two.

53:35.960 --> 53:37.759
So, where's the other one?

53:37.760 --> 53:39.239
I won't tell you.

53:39.240 --> 53:41.000
Not until you've let me go.

53:42.560 --> 53:46.120
Let me make a phone call,
ten minutes, you'll have it.

53:51.080 --> 53:52.680
No.

53:55.840 --> 53:57.280
I'm not going to do that.

53:58.920 --> 54:00.560
I'm going to make you tell me.

54:06.280 --> 54:08.080
Like this.

54:15.720 --> 54:18.079
No! Where is it?

54:18.080 --> 54:20.879
I don't know! I don't know!

54:20.880 --> 54:23.879
But I can help you find it!
The builder had it.

54:23.880 --> 54:27.919
He asked me if I could use it,
but he didn't say where it was.

54:27.920 --> 54:29.760
The builder, Jannsen? Yes!

54:30.760 --> 54:33.439
He's dead.
He's got it somewhere!

54:33.440 --> 54:35.480
I swear to you! Shh!

54:37.800 --> 54:39.240
I believe you.

54:43.720 --> 54:46.319
All right, listen to me.

54:46.320 --> 54:47.800
You're not stupid.

54:49.200 --> 54:50.759
You know who I am.

54:50.760 --> 54:53.719
Whatever you're being paid,
I can double it.

54:53.720 --> 54:55.600
I can triple it.

54:56.640 --> 54:59.520
I can find it for you.
I can help you.

55:00.640 --> 55:03.160
I know what it looks like!
Thanks.

55:04.160 --> 55:06.240
But, you know...

55:09.560 --> 55:11.320
I can do that myself.

55:45.880 --> 55:47.199
Rash.

55:47.200 --> 55:49.680
Are you asleep?

55:55.200 --> 55:57.759
Wake up. Mm?

55:57.760 --> 55:59.879
Wake up! WAKE UP!

55:59.880 --> 56:01.240
Uh! Huh?

56:07.880 --> 56:09.639
What happened?

56:09.640 --> 56:11.200
I don't know.

56:13.400 --> 56:15.240
JESUS!

56:19.720 --> 56:21.839
Is Gulliver still in there?
Well, I don't know.

56:21.840 --> 56:24.439
We have to go in! If you go in
there, you're going to get killed!

56:24.440 --> 56:26.639
I'm going to get killed anyway!

56:26.640 --> 56:29.119
No, no, no!
Get off!

56:29.120 --> 56:32.000
How did this happen?
How COULD it happen?

56:33.160 --> 56:34.639
It wasn't your fault.

56:34.640 --> 56:37.479
I know it's not my fault.
It's YOUR fault!

56:37.480 --> 56:38.880
Whoa! Whoa!

56:48.880 --> 56:50.919
What are you doing?

56:50.920 --> 56:52.600
You started it.

57:02.040 --> 57:04.799
Somebody tied Gulliver to a chair
and then set him on fire.

57:04.800 --> 57:06.119
Jesus.

57:06.120 --> 57:08.599
Eleanor shut down the investigation,
she sent me home.

57:08.600 --> 57:10.799
Then she won't know what
you're up to.

57:10.800 --> 57:13.239
Let me see if I can talk myself
out of firing you.

57:13.240 --> 57:15.279
Why do you let these people
walk all over you?

57:15.280 --> 57:16.879
Because they're bastards!

57:16.880 --> 57:19.360
This has gone on long enough,
close it down.

57:21.040 --> 57:23.000
Stop!
