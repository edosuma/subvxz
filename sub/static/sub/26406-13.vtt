WEBVTT

00:00.820 --> 00:03.956
And that's pretty much it
for this morning.

00:03.956 --> 00:05.189
Except remember to be

00:05.191 --> 00:07.024
on the lookout for jilted lovers.

00:07.026 --> 00:10.594
We'd like to break the streak
of revenge stabbings

00:10.596 --> 00:12.350
this Valentine's.

00:12.488 --> 00:13.600
Any questions?

00:13.601 --> 00:15.510
We can't hear anything you're saying.

00:15.511 --> 00:16.174
What?

00:16.175 --> 00:18.955
We can't hear anything you're saying!

00:18.956 --> 00:21.055
I'm sorry. I... I'm having a hard time

00:21.057 --> 00:22.491
hearing you over the birds.

00:22.492 --> 00:23.874
Maybe Dina shouldn't have brought

00:23.876 --> 00:25.387
her loud, dirty birds into work.

00:25.388 --> 00:28.186
The birds are suffering
severe separation anxiety.

00:28.187 --> 00:30.881
What am I supposed to do?
Leave them home alone?

00:30.883 --> 00:33.917
I mean, traditionally,
that is what you do with pets.

00:35.012 --> 00:36.984
If Dina can bring in her birds,

00:36.985 --> 00:39.590
I'd like to bring in my cat.
He's very sick with dysentery.

00:39.592 --> 00:42.693
This is insane. It smells
like Toucan Sam's butthole!

00:42.695 --> 00:44.495
Just because you eat something fruity,

00:44.497 --> 00:46.206
doesn't make your butt smell fruity.

00:46.206 --> 00:47.295
For birds, it does.

00:47.295 --> 00:50.113
Small berries pass through them
virtually undigested.

00:50.115 --> 00:52.065
Okay, good meeting, everyone!

00:52.067 --> 00:53.066
What?

00:53.964 --> 00:56.636
Synced and corrected by hawken45

00:58.589 --> 01:00.207
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers,

01:00.208 --> 01:02.553
today we celebrate St. Valentine,

01:02.554 --> 01:04.696
a priest who was beaten, stoned,

01:04.697 --> 01:06.629
dragged through town, and decapitated.

01:07.023 --> 01:09.832
Some say the color red
represents the pools of blood

01:09.834 --> 01:10.750
around his body.

01:11.430 --> 01:13.239
Cute teddy bears are 15% off.

01:14.495 --> 01:16.638
What are you getting me
for Valentine's Day?

01:16.640 --> 01:18.095
Is it Valentine's Day?

01:18.096 --> 01:19.820
Mm-hmm. You didn't get me something?

01:19.821 --> 01:21.886
Do you have any Valentine's
Day cards for my wife

01:21.887 --> 01:23.146
that are cheaper than this?

01:23.147 --> 01:25.778
Well, that one's a dollar, so, no.

01:26.150 --> 01:28.254
Forget it. I'll just text her.

01:29.386 --> 01:30.825
Love is in the air.

01:31.252 --> 01:32.276
Oh, come on!

01:32.277 --> 01:34.671
Don't go all cynical on me.
This is a big day.

01:34.672 --> 01:39.094
This is our first Valentine's
as... daters?

01:39.096 --> 01:41.063
Not really a good word
for an adult relationship.

01:41.065 --> 01:42.931
No, boyfriend/girlfriend
makes us sound like

01:42.933 --> 01:44.266
we're in 8th grade.

01:44.268 --> 01:45.567
Lovers is gross.

01:45.569 --> 01:48.303
Ugh. Partners?

01:48.305 --> 01:51.525
What are we, lesbians that
own a candle shop together?

01:51.745 --> 01:52.635
Fair point.

01:53.377 --> 01:56.278
- My main squeeze?
- Don't do that again.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.704
- No?
- No.

01:57.705 --> 01:58.597
You don't like that, main squeeze?

01:58.599 --> 01:59.792
I don't like that, main squeeze.

01:59.793 --> 02:00.548
Give me a squeeze.

02:00.549 --> 02:02.818
How much would it be
for just one Post-It?

02:02.820 --> 02:04.298
I don't need the whole pack.

02:05.456 --> 02:07.288
It's not how it works.

02:08.583 --> 02:09.744
If any of you guys don't have plans,

02:09.745 --> 02:11.760
I'm going to an
anti-Valentine's Day party

02:11.762 --> 02:13.195
tonight with some college kids.

02:13.531 --> 02:16.031
Should be a ton of ween
and the flyer says

02:16.033 --> 02:17.611
no one shall be turned away.

02:17.612 --> 02:18.211
I'll go.

02:18.769 --> 02:20.502
Jerry's working late again tonight,

02:20.504 --> 02:22.504
- so I'm on my own.
- Wow, again.

02:22.506 --> 02:23.972
It's funny that a sign spinner

02:23.974 --> 02:25.073
would keep those kinds of hours.

02:25.075 --> 02:26.264
- I know.
- Sandra?

02:26.265 --> 02:27.609
Do you have any plans for tonight?

02:27.611 --> 02:29.216
Nope. Nuh-uh.

02:29.686 --> 02:31.447
Not seeing anyone, so

02:31.448 --> 02:34.383
I'm just gonna hang alone
in the ol' apartmentito.

02:34.385 --> 02:36.291
- So sad.
- Isn't it?

02:39.406 --> 02:40.190
Hey, Dana?

02:40.690 --> 02:43.225
So I don't know
what you thought you saw

02:43.227 --> 02:44.672
me and Jerry doing during the blizzard.

02:44.673 --> 02:45.837
Oh, I know what I saw.

02:46.490 --> 02:49.335
It was like Winnie the Pooh
with his head in the honeypot.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.678
What had happened was I had
spilled coffee on my pants,

02:52.679 --> 02:54.975
so I took them off to dry,
and Jerry came over to help,

02:54.976 --> 02:58.357
but he tripped and tipped over
into my crotch, so...

02:58.359 --> 03:00.338
Stop, please.

03:01.111 --> 03:03.212
I'm not gonna tell anyone
about your little affair.

03:03.214 --> 03:07.055
Okay, thank you. I hate having secrets,

03:07.988 --> 03:12.044
although the sneaking around
has made it even sexier.

03:12.045 --> 03:14.059
Nope, nope, nope. That's gross.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.279
He comes over every night,

03:16.280 --> 03:19.955
and sometimes we make lasagna together

03:19.956 --> 03:22.197
and eat it off each other's bodies.

03:22.199 --> 03:24.722
Elias, I'm gonna need you
to clean up the vomit

03:24.723 --> 03:26.357
that's gonna be all over
the ladies' bathroom

03:26.358 --> 03:28.095
in about three minutes.

03:31.008 --> 03:31.655
Go on.

03:32.182 --> 03:36.034
Everyone's calm. No eye contact.

03:36.130 --> 03:38.247
Seems like a lot of work
just to buy some chips.

03:38.249 --> 03:41.923
I'm not gonna let some stupid birds

03:41.924 --> 03:45.842
stop me from getting my morning Takis.

03:46.614 --> 03:49.241
You know we sell Takis
in the store, right?

03:49.243 --> 03:51.944
Uh-huh, but I like the little ones

03:51.946 --> 03:53.896
that come out of the vending machine.

03:53.898 --> 03:57.068
Aww, I like learning
about your little rituals.

03:57.388 --> 04:00.202
So you want Cheyenne
to tattoo your mom's face

04:00.204 --> 04:02.562
on your back as a gift to your mom?

04:02.563 --> 04:03.944
Yeah, I was gonna go to a pro,

04:03.945 --> 04:05.298
but you cannot get an appointment

04:05.299 --> 04:07.175
at a tattoo parlor on Valentine's Day.

04:07.177 --> 04:08.994
Don't worry, my instructor says

04:08.996 --> 04:10.717
that I'm the best in the class.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.682
He was trained by the guy
who did Steve-O's back.

04:13.684 --> 04:15.050
I'm sorry, I'm still not over this.

04:15.052 --> 04:18.153
You want a tattoo of
your mom, for your mom,

04:18.154 --> 04:20.122
on Valentine's Day. Why?

04:20.124 --> 04:21.623
'Cause I'm her special guy,

04:21.625 --> 04:22.981
and the tattoo will be a surprise

04:22.982 --> 04:25.127
for when she scratches my back
while I fall asleep.

04:25.129 --> 04:27.850
- Don't make this weird.
- Yeah, I made it weird.

04:28.198 --> 04:31.580
Which sweater makes me look
more like a wise dad,

04:31.581 --> 04:33.216
the charcoal or the smoke?

04:33.217 --> 04:35.802
Hmm, I think the charcoal.

04:35.803 --> 04:37.920
That's the smoke.

04:38.238 --> 04:40.909
Dina's right, you don't know fashion.

04:40.911 --> 04:43.384
Okay. Well, what do you need them for?

04:43.385 --> 04:46.014
Oh, I'm making videos
of myself for Rose to watch

04:46.016 --> 04:47.489
when I'm not home 'cause, you know,

04:47.490 --> 04:50.018
I work here 16 to 19 hours a day,

04:50.020 --> 04:51.674
so I'm missing a lot of time with her.

04:51.675 --> 04:52.988
Wait, what... why?

04:52.990 --> 04:54.690
Why are working that many hours?

04:54.692 --> 04:56.391
Well, you know,
I get here around 4:00 a.m.

04:56.393 --> 04:57.651
to walk the store,

04:57.652 --> 04:59.878
and then there's the workday,
and then after closing,

04:59.879 --> 05:01.746
it takes me two hours
to prepare my script

05:01.747 --> 05:03.632
for the next morning's
break room meeting.

05:03.634 --> 05:06.339
Those are pre... prepared comments?

05:06.340 --> 05:08.449
No, I just come up with all that

05:08.450 --> 05:09.572
off the top of my head.

05:10.047 --> 05:11.261
Come on, Amy.

05:11.875 --> 05:14.537
Careful, careful.

05:14.538 --> 05:15.372
I'm being careful.

05:15.373 --> 05:17.116
I don't need you
to tell me to be careful.

05:17.815 --> 05:19.080
All right, here we go.

05:21.933 --> 05:24.525
- Nice job.
- All right.

05:25.939 --> 05:28.702
You see, the trick is steady hands.

05:29.259 --> 05:31.593
I was gonna be a surgeon, but...

05:31.595 --> 05:33.245
- Oh, no!
- Whoa!

05:33.247 --> 05:34.896
Uh, nope. Uh, oh. No. Uh-uh.

05:34.898 --> 05:36.314
No, no, no, no. Get the birds!

05:36.316 --> 05:37.399
I know!

05:44.808 --> 05:46.808
No thank you, no thank you,
no thank you.

05:46.810 --> 05:49.344
Wait, stop it! No!

05:50.681 --> 05:52.714
No. No, wait.

05:54.651 --> 05:56.485
The birds are out! Lock all the doors!

05:56.487 --> 05:58.120
They're getting away!

05:58.122 --> 05:59.721
Shut the doors! It's not too late!

05:59.723 --> 06:01.289
Oh, God! No!

06:01.291 --> 06:02.758
Don't let them get away!

06:02.760 --> 06:04.659
- Oh, my God!
- Come back!

06:04.661 --> 06:06.695
Oh, no! The doors! Please!

06:06.697 --> 06:09.181
Ah! My babies!

06:09.183 --> 06:12.419
No!

06:12.573 --> 06:15.865
Sebastian! Where are you?

06:19.269 --> 06:20.364
Cockatrice!

06:21.052 --> 06:22.694
I'm here, baby!

06:23.241 --> 06:24.618
Birdie!

06:24.620 --> 06:26.920
Ugh, I feel so bad for her.

06:27.801 --> 06:29.333
It's like with kids, you know?

06:29.333 --> 06:30.757
You can be the best parent,

06:30.759 --> 06:32.592
and then one day you forget
to lock the cage,

06:32.594 --> 06:34.218
and they're gone.

06:35.539 --> 06:37.381
I don't put my kids in cages. That's...

06:37.383 --> 06:39.754
It wasn't Dina, it was Garret.

06:40.575 --> 06:41.958
- What?
- Yeah, it was a mistake.

06:41.959 --> 06:44.743
Uh, he wanted these Takis.
It's... you had to be there,

06:44.744 --> 06:47.210
but anyway, he... he
cracked the door open,

06:47.211 --> 06:48.716
and the birds just all flew out.

06:48.718 --> 06:49.538
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.436
Hey, can you two stop
scissoring each other

06:51.437 --> 06:53.420
for one second
and help me call my birds?

06:53.421 --> 06:54.489
Yes, sure.

07:01.949 --> 07:03.055
Happy Valentine's Day.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.586
Ooh, I thought you
weren't seeing anyone.

07:07.587 --> 07:09.481
It's not... I mean, it's kind of a...

07:09.687 --> 07:11.362
it's just... it's complicated.

07:12.773 --> 07:14.146
What are you laughing at?

07:14.147 --> 07:16.352
Oh, I was just remembering
the time you wanted everyone

07:16.353 --> 07:19.102
to think you had a boyfriend,
so you kept sending yourself

07:19.103 --> 07:21.008
Valentine's gifts from Jeff.

07:21.009 --> 07:22.955
I didn't send this to myself.

07:22.956 --> 07:24.776
There's a card.

07:24.777 --> 07:25.749
No, wait. No, no.

07:25.750 --> 07:30.350
"To my Sandy Bear,
love Antonio Lasagna."

07:32.159 --> 07:36.280
That's a... such a distinctive,
real-sounding name.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.890
It's Italian, probably.
It sounds Italian.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.348
- Mm-hmm.
- Yup.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.681
Now, this book is one

07:43.682 --> 07:45.514
that Nana Sturgis used to read to me

07:45.515 --> 07:46.616
when I was little.

07:46.617 --> 07:49.217
It's called "You Can Do It."

07:51.682 --> 07:53.714
"Jimmy wants to be an astronaut

07:53.715 --> 07:55.905
and fly a rocket to space."

07:56.353 --> 07:58.179
"You can do it, Jimmy!"

07:59.035 --> 08:01.580
"Polly wants to be an astronaut's wife

08:01.581 --> 08:04.870
and keep the house tidy
the way Jimmy likes it."

08:06.181 --> 08:08.464
"You can do it, Polly."

08:08.946 --> 08:10.627
Wow, I have not read this in a while.

08:12.017 --> 08:13.951
Um, what else we got?

08:13.952 --> 08:16.767
"Midget Sam Goes
To Darkest Africa," no.

08:16.768 --> 08:18.550
"Get To Know The Orientals"?

08:18.551 --> 08:22.278
Oh, man! Oh, God!

08:22.279 --> 08:24.112
You do not get used to that pain!

08:24.552 --> 08:27.586
Oh! But it'll all be worth it
for that look at my mom's face

08:27.587 --> 08:28.911
when she takes my shirt off.

08:29.311 --> 08:31.020
Totally, totally!

08:34.030 --> 08:35.510
Uh, can you hang on for a second?

08:35.510 --> 08:38.190
I just have to tell Mateo
something before I forget.

08:38.192 --> 08:40.373
- Oh, oh.
- Hey.

08:41.195 --> 08:42.462
I [bleep] up.

08:42.462 --> 08:44.044
What are you talking about?

08:44.046 --> 08:47.368
Marcus's tattoo.
It's way harder than I thought.

08:47.369 --> 08:48.673
I thought you were taking classes.

08:48.674 --> 08:51.168
I am, but so far,
I've only tattooed grapefruits,

08:51.169 --> 08:53.108
and I thought it would be
the same, but it's not!

08:53.109 --> 08:55.927
The skin is all mushy and bleed-y.

08:55.928 --> 08:58.629
Girl, don't be so hard up
on yourself, okay?

08:58.631 --> 09:01.465
I'm sure it's not nearly
as bad as you...

09:01.467 --> 09:02.288
What?

09:02.289 --> 09:05.636
That is just so amazing.

09:05.638 --> 09:08.081
Um, is your mother a model?

09:08.082 --> 09:10.117
Uh, kind of. She used to wear

09:10.118 --> 09:11.892
the Fredbird costume for the Cardinals.

09:13.729 --> 09:14.808
I can see that.

09:15.781 --> 09:19.679
- Wow, that's a lot.
- Yeah, what do you think?

09:19.720 --> 09:21.618
I had to take down that poster
of that missing kid,

09:21.620 --> 09:22.943
but I mean at this point...

09:23.336 --> 09:25.906
I never should've left
them in that cheap cage

09:25.908 --> 09:26.907
with that crap lock.

09:26.909 --> 09:28.792
This is why workplaces need

09:28.794 --> 09:30.660
secure, dedicated aviaries.

09:30.661 --> 09:32.629
Dina, you can't really blame yourself.

09:32.631 --> 09:33.866
That's sweet of you to say,

09:33.867 --> 09:35.999
but I have to take
responsibility for what I did.

09:36.001 --> 09:37.645
I let my birds escape,

09:37.920 --> 09:39.879
and I to live with that
for the rest of my life.

09:40.506 --> 09:41.805
Um, no, Dina...

09:41.807 --> 09:43.836
No, it's fine. It's fine.

09:43.837 --> 09:45.809
I'm already getting used
to the feeling.

09:45.811 --> 09:49.236
It's just like a...
like a searing gnawing

09:49.648 --> 09:51.330
deep inside my soul.

09:51.817 --> 09:53.894
It's very, very specific.

09:53.895 --> 09:56.019
Um, oops!

09:56.555 --> 09:57.688
Out of flyers.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:07.950 --> 10:09.616
I feel guilty about the birds.

10:11.537 --> 10:13.036
- Okay.
- I just...

10:14.542 --> 10:15.925
I just kind of need
to talk to a friend.

10:16.008 --> 10:19.377
Oh, oh, well,
I'm a friend, so talk away.

10:19.378 --> 10:22.530
It's just this is, like,
the worst thing I've ever done,

10:22.531 --> 10:25.048
and I have no idea what
Dina's going to do

10:25.050 --> 10:26.385
if she finds out that it was me.

10:26.386 --> 10:29.105
Oh, listen, you... you do not
have to worry about that, okay?

10:29.106 --> 10:30.888
Because I am not gonna tell her.

10:30.890 --> 10:33.390
This is a secret
that stays amongst friends.

10:33.392 --> 10:35.642
No, I... I... I know I can trust you.

10:35.644 --> 10:37.266
I mean, it's not like
you're going to run off

10:37.267 --> 10:38.695
and tell Amy or anything like that.

10:38.697 --> 10:40.697
Oh, uh, Amy... Amy too.

10:40.699 --> 10:42.733
I mean, uh, of... of course Amy too.

10:42.735 --> 10:44.852
That's... nobody needs to know.

10:46.038 --> 10:47.539
You haven't told her, right?

10:47.540 --> 10:50.157
Mm-mm.

10:52.373 --> 10:54.234
Oh, hey! Hey, hey.
I was looking for you.

10:54.235 --> 10:55.110
I was looking for you.

10:55.111 --> 10:57.171
You haven't said anything to Dina
about Garrett yet, have you?

10:57.172 --> 10:58.421
No, but we have to tell her.

10:58.422 --> 11:00.322
Uh, no, actually, we... we can't.

11:00.324 --> 11:01.488
No, no. We have to.

11:01.489 --> 11:03.094
She's thinks she's the one
who let the birds loose.

11:03.095 --> 11:05.155
Uh, yeah, okay, yeah and that sucks,

11:05.156 --> 11:07.263
but I wasn't supposed
to say anything to you

11:07.264 --> 11:09.318
in the first place,
so now you can't say anything.

11:09.319 --> 11:11.189
So, I'm sorry, I'm supposed
to just let her go on

11:11.190 --> 11:13.047
beating herself up when
it wasn't really her fault?

11:13.048 --> 11:15.726
- Uh, exactly.
- No! I can't do that.

11:15.727 --> 11:18.272
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Just pretend you don't know.

11:18.273 --> 11:20.939
- But I do know.
- That's why I said pretend.

11:21.019 --> 11:21.911
Excuse me,

11:22.560 --> 11:24.955
this card has a frog and a bear
kissing each other.

11:25.306 --> 11:27.139
- Very good, yeah.
- What's next,

11:27.148 --> 11:29.482
kangaroos and sharks
having full on anal sex?

11:30.303 --> 11:30.900
Shame.

11:32.653 --> 11:33.096
Wow.

11:36.740 --> 11:38.240
How's it going back there?

11:38.818 --> 11:39.625
It's... good.

11:40.128 --> 11:42.676
It's really turning into something.

11:43.335 --> 11:44.163
Uh, need more ink.

11:46.167 --> 11:48.811
- What do I do?
- Can't you just cover it up?

11:49.265 --> 11:50.546
Oh, yeah, sure.

11:50.820 --> 11:52.476
I'll just turn it into a top hat

11:52.542 --> 11:54.209
and then tattoo his
mom's face underneath,

11:54.318 --> 11:56.191
and then that way it's like
she's a magician, huh?

11:56.192 --> 11:57.569
How's that?

11:57.571 --> 11:59.556
You've never been sarcastic
with me before.

11:59.557 --> 12:00.687
I don't care for it.

12:03.627 --> 12:06.621
- It's tough to watch, huh?
- Yeah, it's terrible.

12:06.622 --> 12:08.869
I just wish there was
something we can do for her,

12:09.282 --> 12:12.142
make her not blame herself so much.

12:12.143 --> 12:13.874
Yeah, I wish we... I can do that too.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.542
Hey, what are y'all two fools

12:16.543 --> 12:18.325
talking about, huh? Stuff?

12:18.326 --> 12:19.310
- Nothing.
- Dina.

12:19.455 --> 12:21.697
Dina? What are you saying about Dina?

12:21.698 --> 12:25.712
Nothing, just that I wish
we knew how her birds got out,

12:25.713 --> 12:27.306
'cause she thinks it was her fault.

12:27.307 --> 12:30.103
Well, it probably is
her fault, for all we know.

12:30.104 --> 12:32.093
Yup, none of us were there.

12:32.797 --> 12:33.614
Nope.

12:34.717 --> 12:36.397
- You told her, didn't you?
- I did not.

12:36.398 --> 12:37.270
- Yes, he did.
- Amy!

12:37.271 --> 12:39.694
- Dude, I trusted you!
- I trusted her!

12:39.696 --> 12:41.245
Fine, you both messed up.

12:41.246 --> 12:43.200
- What about you?
- What did I do?

12:52.217 --> 12:56.211
♪ Keep the love-light glowing ♪

12:56.213 --> 12:59.631
♪ In your eyes so true ♪

12:59.633 --> 13:01.716
How much is it costing her
to keep this up?

13:01.718 --> 13:03.415
It's so sad. I love it.

13:04.221 --> 13:05.519
♪ Let me call you, sweetheart ♪

13:05.520 --> 13:11.643
♪ I'm in love with you ♪

13:13.250 --> 13:14.367
What are you doing?

13:15.084 --> 13:16.803
Not gonna need this stuff anymore.

13:16.804 --> 13:18.321
I mean, they might still come back.

13:18.322 --> 13:19.813
They... birds have, like,

13:19.814 --> 13:21.209
a great sense of direction, right?

13:21.210 --> 13:22.252
They don't know where the store is.

13:22.253 --> 13:24.336
They could be halfway to Mexico by now.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.817
That's assuming
they didn't find their way

13:25.818 --> 13:28.079
into a jet engine or an archery event

13:28.080 --> 13:30.159
or a really clear window,

13:30.804 --> 13:31.923
all because of me.

13:31.924 --> 13:34.183
Look, Dina, the fact is that, um...

13:34.184 --> 13:35.811
Although, I guess it is possible

13:35.812 --> 13:37.606
they could find their way back
to my apartment.

13:37.607 --> 13:38.592
- It is?
- Yeah.

13:38.593 --> 13:40.010
I mean, a few of them
could've found their way,

13:40.011 --> 13:41.256
and the rest just followed.

13:41.616 --> 13:43.307
Well, that's awesome.

13:43.308 --> 13:44.521
Let's go check it out right now.

13:44.522 --> 13:46.227
Wow, you really care about this, huh?

13:46.228 --> 13:48.441
You have no idea.
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

13:48.932 --> 13:50.904
When a man and a woman

13:51.415 --> 13:54.827
go into a bedroom with God,

13:55.605 --> 13:57.011
and they...

13:59.937 --> 14:02.371
There comes a moment of, uh...

14:03.304 --> 14:05.851
between that is holy and...

14:11.603 --> 14:15.319
Ow!

14:15.320 --> 14:18.265
No!

14:18.266 --> 14:19.294
Oh!

14:23.124 --> 14:27.635
Wow, that... that sure is something.

14:28.289 --> 14:29.853
It's a work in progress.

14:29.854 --> 14:31.489
You think my mom will be surprised?

14:31.490 --> 14:33.589
Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's going to be...

14:33.590 --> 14:34.223
shocked.

14:34.224 --> 14:36.285
Hey Jonah,

14:36.286 --> 14:38.095
wanna see what my mom
looks like on my back?

14:38.096 --> 14:39.320
No, thanks. I'm busy.

14:41.024 --> 14:42.845
- Drama.
- Excuse me.

14:44.197 --> 14:45.964
All right, let's keep going.

14:46.534 --> 14:47.298
Oh.

14:49.007 --> 14:53.329
Ow! Oh, God! Why?

14:54.848 --> 14:56.470
Are you actually mad at me?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.264
A little bit, yeah.

14:58.884 --> 15:00.191
Wow, okay, well,

15:00.192 --> 15:01.803
I'm not really that
happy with you either.

15:01.804 --> 15:04.087
Great, it should be
an exciting Valentine's dinner.

15:04.088 --> 15:07.089
You can't expect me to side
with Garrett over Dina.

15:07.090 --> 15:09.675
I was expecting you
to side with me over Dina.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.641
Why? Because you're my boyfriend?

15:11.642 --> 15:13.147
Yeah, pretty much. That's how it works.

15:13.148 --> 15:14.062
Well, not for me.

15:14.063 --> 15:16.097
Great, well, if you love Dina so much,

15:16.098 --> 15:17.398
why don't you go to dinner
with her tonight then, huh?

15:17.399 --> 15:18.675
Oh great, just go on and be a dick.

15:18.676 --> 15:19.389
Oh, come on.

15:19.390 --> 15:21.369
Of course I don't love Dina.
I love you.

15:21.370 --> 15:22.711
Yeah, well, I love you too,

15:22.712 --> 15:24.688
but that has nothing to do
with what we're talking about,

15:24.689 --> 15:26.331
and I'm pretty sure we both just said

15:26.332 --> 15:28.851
- that we love each other.
- Yeah, I know what we said!

15:29.705 --> 15:31.220
Well, I'm glad you're listening.

15:32.179 --> 15:35.735
Portobello! Squeedledee!

15:36.737 --> 15:39.058
Russell Crow, where are you guys?

15:39.338 --> 15:41.057
Follow my voice!

15:41.058 --> 15:42.428
Garrett, it's okay.

15:43.445 --> 15:44.260
They're gone.

15:45.262 --> 15:46.107
Damn it!

15:47.193 --> 15:49.442
Wow, you're almost as upset
about this as I am.

15:49.443 --> 15:51.871
Yeah, man, I... I love those guys.

15:51.872 --> 15:53.949
Guess I'm going to have
to get used to being alone.

15:53.950 --> 15:55.226
No, Dina, you're not alone.

15:55.227 --> 15:55.866
I mean...

15:57.767 --> 15:59.099
I'm here.

15:59.101 --> 16:00.272
Thank you.

16:00.937 --> 16:02.928
You're a really good friend.

16:03.272 --> 16:05.272
No. No, I'm not.

16:05.274 --> 16:08.360
Look, Dina, um...

16:09.078 --> 16:10.703
I need to, um...

16:12.081 --> 16:14.281
I guess I wanted to, um...

16:16.344 --> 16:18.452
I wanted to give you this.

16:19.956 --> 16:21.589
Why are you giving me $17?

16:21.591 --> 16:25.125
'Cause, uh, I thought
that you needed it.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.292
Well, you're just full of surprises.

16:27.949 --> 16:28.828
Thank you.

16:30.394 --> 16:32.322
You know what?
No, look, here's the deal.

16:32.323 --> 16:33.591
This was not what I was...

16:33.592 --> 16:34.763
whoa, whoa, whoa!
Dina, what are you doing?

16:34.764 --> 16:37.495
I just... I just don't want to
think about the birds right now.

16:40.676 --> 16:41.701
You're into this, right?

16:41.702 --> 16:43.643
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.997
You're... you're just
not taking your clothes off.

16:46.998 --> 16:49.228
Uh, uh, eh, that gets me horny.

16:49.575 --> 16:51.259
That's new. Hot.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.940
Thanks, not just for the sex...

16:58.149 --> 16:59.398
but, I mean, it was decent.

16:59.592 --> 17:00.288
Sure.

17:00.930 --> 17:01.795
I mean...

17:03.302 --> 17:04.813
thanks for being so supportive.

17:05.260 --> 17:07.199
I guess we'll always be there
for each other, huh?

17:07.201 --> 17:08.252
Yup.

17:09.132 --> 17:11.319
I mean, it was better than decent.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.454
It just wasn't great.

17:13.021 --> 17:14.455
You know, it was fine.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.208
If it were a meal, it would be like,

17:16.210 --> 17:18.327
"Oh, that's done."

17:18.753 --> 17:19.669
You know?

17:23.281 --> 17:25.501
Did I climax? Sure.

17:30.015 --> 17:31.182
Ah, this is good.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.324
I think as soon as this is done,

17:33.325 --> 17:35.802
I am going to be ready for round deux.

17:38.746 --> 17:40.807
Now you're probably
in a lot of pain right now,

17:40.809 --> 17:42.989
so you're probably not seeing it right.

17:43.514 --> 17:45.014
That's a good point.

17:45.197 --> 17:47.280
It you can see it how we're seeing it,

17:47.525 --> 17:49.282
it's even better than this.

17:49.284 --> 17:52.318
Yeah, and... and the reason
for the hat is because

17:52.320 --> 17:54.821
moms today have to wear
so many different hats,

17:54.823 --> 17:56.806
or, like, one big hat.

17:59.527 --> 18:00.590
What was that?

18:01.111 --> 18:02.560
What have you done to me?

18:02.883 --> 18:04.229
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

18:04.231 --> 18:06.233
What have you done to me?

18:06.234 --> 18:09.489
So to review, you released
Dina's birds into the wild,

18:09.490 --> 18:11.479
allowed her to believe
it was her fault,

18:11.480 --> 18:13.501
persuaded her to go back
to her apartment,

18:13.502 --> 18:16.945
and proceeded to have sex
with her in exchange for $17?

18:16.946 --> 18:18.462
Twice. We did it twice.

18:18.463 --> 18:19.966
What is wrong with you?

18:19.967 --> 18:22.358
I just wanted some Takis, you know?

18:22.966 --> 18:24.966
Rolled up tortilla chips,
bit of flavor in the morning,

18:24.968 --> 18:26.048
and then everything just escalated.

18:26.049 --> 18:27.452
You know, as your friend, I'd ask you

18:27.453 --> 18:28.653
to consider your part in this,

18:28.654 --> 18:32.090
which is all of it.
This is all your fault.

18:32.092 --> 18:33.979
Yeah, you're right. I'm gonna tell her.

18:34.013 --> 18:34.695
- No!
- Good.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.514
No! Absolutely not!

18:36.767 --> 18:38.402
She must never know any of this.

18:38.403 --> 18:40.324
You were the one who said
he should be telling her.

18:40.325 --> 18:42.165
Yes, but that was before!

18:42.166 --> 18:43.969
Before I was the friend who sat idly by

18:43.970 --> 18:46.438
while her birds' murderer
went off and sympathy-sexed her

18:46.440 --> 18:47.447
at her lowest moment.

18:47.448 --> 18:50.158
Absolutely not! No, sir!
She will not know any of this!

18:50.160 --> 18:51.568
Wait a second, so I'm
supposed to sit around

18:51.569 --> 18:53.278
with this for the rest of my life?

18:53.280 --> 18:54.412
I can't live with that kind of guilt.

18:54.413 --> 18:56.053
Well, too bad!

18:56.786 --> 18:57.858
Find a way.

19:02.863 --> 19:03.645
While I have you,

19:03.646 --> 19:06.784
um, we said we love each other,

19:06.785 --> 19:08.260
so pretty cool.

19:08.977 --> 19:10.943
I'll fill you in on the details later.

19:13.824 --> 19:15.034
Sandra, are you sure

19:15.035 --> 19:16.046
you don't wanna come to the party?

19:16.047 --> 19:18.185
It's going to be, like, dong central.

19:18.186 --> 19:20.472
That sounds really fun,
but no thank you.

19:20.474 --> 19:22.017
Take the hint, Justine.

19:22.018 --> 19:24.151
She obviously has big plans tonight

19:24.152 --> 19:25.810
with Antonio Lasagna.

19:26.323 --> 19:28.915
Well, if you wanna crush
some dong, call me.

19:29.316 --> 19:31.147
They better have food at this party.

19:31.148 --> 19:33.176
Actually, they told me
I had to bring pizzas.

19:34.154 --> 19:35.358
I really hate her.

19:35.805 --> 19:37.132
Me too, Sandy Bear.

19:41.545 --> 19:43.287
Rose, I am so sorry

19:43.288 --> 19:45.711
I couldn't be there
for your wedding day,

19:46.166 --> 19:49.944
but I am so happy for you
and your husband...

19:50.387 --> 19:54.137
or... or wife or sex android.

19:54.138 --> 19:56.102
I... I don't know
what the future is like.

19:56.906 --> 20:00.563
Just don't make the same
mistakes I made, you know?

20:00.564 --> 20:03.014
Spending all your time
at work and missing out

20:03.016 --> 20:04.287
on these precious moments.

20:04.288 --> 20:06.801
I mean, if I could go back in time

20:06.802 --> 20:08.382
and do it all over again,

20:08.383 --> 20:09.280
I...

20:10.790 --> 20:11.439
huh.

20:14.916 --> 20:17.122
I think I'm done being manager.

20:23.970 --> 20:25.505
So where are we going to dinner?

20:25.506 --> 20:26.384
It's a surprise.

20:26.904 --> 20:28.687
Is it that tapas place I love?

20:28.688 --> 20:30.425
It's that tapas place I love.

20:30.426 --> 20:33.045
- You guys heading out?
- Yeah, going to dinner.

20:33.046 --> 20:34.342
Oh, that sounds fun.

20:34.882 --> 20:37.432
I'd go with you but, uh,
I've got to deal with the birds

20:37.434 --> 20:38.870
and their medicine and...

20:39.177 --> 20:41.617
Wow, I guess I don't

20:41.618 --> 20:43.387
have to deal with any of that anymore.

20:44.516 --> 20:47.235
You know what? I can go with you.

20:47.611 --> 20:49.959
- Oh, yeah, well...
- Oh, wow, that's perfect.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.502
So where we headed?

20:51.503 --> 20:55.795
Uh, it's this place off of 44
called Barrel and Sage,

20:55.796 --> 20:58.229
kind of a, um,
small plates tapas thing.

20:58.230 --> 21:00.471
Not gonna work for me.
Not enough vegan options.

21:00.472 --> 21:02.222
I do know of a grocery
store that has tables,

21:02.223 --> 21:03.709
that way we can all do our own thing.

21:03.710 --> 21:06.973
Or, oh, have you guys
ever been to Super Tofu?

21:06.974 --> 21:09.145
It's not great, but you do not
need reservations.

21:09.146 --> 21:10.275
There's never anyone there.

21:10.276 --> 21:11.311
I mean, it smells bad,

21:11.312 --> 21:13.532
but you get used to it
as the meal progresses.
