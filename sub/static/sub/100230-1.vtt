29:18.413 --> 29:21.983
[gasps] This is your bump up.
This is our chance!

29:22.117 --> 29:23.651
What the fuck
are we gonna feed 'em?

29:23.786 --> 29:25.754
What are they gonna drink?
Are you crazy?

29:25.886 --> 29:28.690
We are gonna throw the best party,
with the best food, the best everything!

29:28.824 --> 29:30.592
[gasps]
Don't you see?

29:30.726 --> 29:33.362
Don Vitone's gonna see
what a good man you are.

29:33.495 --> 29:36.363
This is our moment,
Joseph!

29:36.498 --> 29:39.834
- You really think so?
- Yeah!

29:39.968 --> 29:42.070
- Get in the fuckin' kitchen! Start cookin'!
- All right!

29:42.203 --> 29:45.340
- Call your fuckin' mother! I gotta make some phone calls!
- All right, pasta, gnocchi.

29:47.242 --> 29:49.777
Hey, Ed.
How's it goin' under there?

29:49.911 --> 29:51.680
I think
I figured it out.

29:51.814 --> 29:53.850
Oh! Hey, beer?

29:53.982 --> 29:56.618
- Yeah, I'd love one.
- Here you go.

29:56.751 --> 29:59.855
- Choke linkage was hung up.
- Hey, Mom, when's dinner?

29:59.988 --> 30:02.024
I told you guys
to stay inside.

30:02.158 --> 30:05.561
- Who's your friend, Mommy?
- Uh, excuse me.

30:06.362 --> 30:08.596
It's Ed. Remember,
he helped us with Rexy.

30:08.730 --> 30:11.566
Uh, Sergeant Croswell.
I was wearin' a uniform.

30:11.700 --> 30:12.700
You got a badge?

30:12.834 --> 30:15.002
- Sure do. You wanna see it?
- Yeah.

30:15.136 --> 30:16.771
Here you go.

30:19.173 --> 30:21.276
Our daddy had
one of these too.

30:21.410 --> 30:24.546
I know. I worked with your dad.
He was a great man.

30:25.212 --> 30:26.981
Okay.
Come on, kids. Inside.

30:27.114 --> 30:28.950
Move it.
Dinner's soon.

30:29.084 --> 30:32.053
Hey, wait. We still gotta fire
this baby up. You wanna help me?

30:32.187 --> 30:33.488
- Yeah.
- All right, come on.

30:33.623 --> 30:34.623
Be careful.

30:35.857 --> 30:38.693
All right, don't touch
anything till I get in there.

30:41.896 --> 30:44.466
Don't turn it on yet, you.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.569
All right.
You're gonna take this key,

30:46.701 --> 30:50.305
and you're gonna put it in the
slot and turn it clockwise.

30:50.439 --> 30:53.808
- [car engine revving]
- [cheering]

30:53.942 --> 30:56.677
- [girl 1] You did it!
- [girl 2] Go, Billy!

30:56.812 --> 30:58.714
Baby, you did it!

30:58.846 --> 31:00.516
Wow! Well,
what was wrong with it?

31:00.649 --> 31:02.883
Uh, it just wasn't
gettin' enough air.

31:03.017 --> 31:04.853
- Oh.
- The carburetor.

31:04.987 --> 31:06.555
Oh, okay.

31:06.688 --> 31:09.792
Well, all right, kids.
Come on, inside now. Wash up for supper.

31:09.924 --> 31:11.726
Go ahead, hurry up!

31:11.860 --> 31:14.396
All right, what do I owe you?
Really, I appreciate it.

31:14.529 --> 31:17.298
Oh, come on. Nothin'.
It's on the house.

31:17.431 --> 31:18.866
No, no, Ed. Mm.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.069
Are you hungry?
At least let me feed you.

31:21.202 --> 31:23.972
- I should really get goin'.
- No, I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

31:24.105 --> 31:27.008
- You just have to clean up a little.
- Let me clean up a little, okay?

31:27.142 --> 31:28.710
Okay, okay.

31:30.679 --> 31:33.114
So, how did you get
so good with cars?

31:33.248 --> 31:34.883
My dad loved cars.

31:35.017 --> 31:38.286
We started rebuilding our first
hot rod when I was ten years old.

31:38.420 --> 31:39.755
What's a hot rod?

31:39.889 --> 31:42.390
Uh, it's a car that you
build from the ground up.

31:42.524 --> 31:46.862
- Why don't you just buy one?
- Yeah, why don't you just buy one that's already built?

31:46.996 --> 31:48.764
Excuse me. Why so rude?

31:48.898 --> 31:51.333
No, that's actually
a good question.

31:51.466 --> 31:52.834
It's 'cause it's fun.

31:52.968 --> 31:55.269
You know, buildin' somethin'
with your hands. It's like

31:55.403 --> 31:57.305
playin' with wood blocks
or Tinker Toys.

31:57.439 --> 32:01.642
- We have wooden blocks.
- You do? And don't you like to build stuff with 'em?

32:01.776 --> 32:05.748
Yeah. I built a big castle the other day.
It was this tall.

32:05.881 --> 32:08.484
- [Billy] No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

32:08.616 --> 32:10.853
I used every single
block we had.

32:10.986 --> 32:13.889
Well, that's impressive.
And it was fun, wasn't it?

32:15.123 --> 32:16.691
Where is it, your hot rod?

32:16.825 --> 32:19.428
Oh, that car?
It's long gone.

32:19.561 --> 32:23.299
Oh. Well, you can borrow
some of my blocks if you'd like.

32:24.432 --> 32:27.802
Aw, thanks.
That's awfully sweet, June.

32:27.936 --> 32:30.606
I'm done, Mommy.
Can I be excused?

32:30.739 --> 32:33.508
- Yes, but get ready for bed.
- All right.

32:33.642 --> 32:36.679
- I'm done too, Mommy.
- Yeah, me too.

32:36.812 --> 32:39.281
- [Natalie] Remember to brush your teeth.
- Good night, guys.

32:39.414 --> 32:40.849
[Billy] Bye.

32:47.222 --> 32:50.959
So, hot rods, huh?

32:51.093 --> 32:54.563
[chuckles]
Yeah. I love cars.

32:56.698 --> 32:58.334
You still close
with your folks?

32:58.467 --> 33:00.503
Nah, they're not
around anymore.

33:01.569 --> 33:04.105
My dad never made it
back from the war,

33:04.238 --> 33:07.476
and my mom...
let's just say she...

33:07.609 --> 33:09.411
she wasn't good
at being alone.

33:09.545 --> 33:11.747
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

33:11.880 --> 33:15.284
Well, grief has a way
of lingering, I guess.

33:15.417 --> 33:17.319
Well, for me anyway.

33:17.452 --> 33:19.020
Yeah.

33:19.153 --> 33:21.055
How are you doin'
with that?

33:21.189 --> 33:23.624
I'm okay. Yeah.

33:23.757 --> 33:27.363
As long as the kids are
happy, then I'm happy.

33:30.798 --> 33:32.600
You still living
in the barracks, Ed?

33:32.735 --> 33:34.436
How did you know
I live in the barracks?

33:34.568 --> 33:36.872
Well,
it's a small town, Ed.

33:37.005 --> 33:39.408
Oh, yeah.

33:39.542 --> 33:42.611
Yeah. I like it there.
It's... It's convenient.

33:42.745 --> 33:45.214
- Yeah, convenient.
- Yeah.

33:45.346 --> 33:47.882
There's not much
of a morning commute.

33:48.016 --> 33:49.383
No.

33:49.517 --> 33:50.885
But convenient?
What about...

33:51.018 --> 33:53.622
Is it comfortable?
Don't you miss this?

33:53.755 --> 33:57.592
Well, you know,
I'm not sure about comfort.

33:57.726 --> 34:00.629
I think it makes you soft.
I want to be ready.

34:00.761 --> 34:03.897
Just ready, on call
if somethin' goes down.

34:04.032 --> 34:07.369
On call. [chuckles]
For this little town?

34:07.501 --> 34:11.005
Now, you'd be surprised. I'm workin'
on a really big case right here.

34:11.139 --> 34:13.308
Probably the biggest thing that's
ever happened in this town.

34:13.442 --> 34:16.378
Really?
Well, do tell.

34:16.511 --> 34:18.612
Can't say.
It's official police business.

34:18.746 --> 34:23.018
Oh, you with your
"official police business."

34:23.150 --> 34:26.589
I have reason to believe that there
is a network of organized crime

34:26.721 --> 34:28.857
running in and out
of this area.

34:28.991 --> 34:32.726
What? What does even
organized crime mean?

34:32.860 --> 34:34.029
Well...

34:35.531 --> 34:37.266
Right here.

34:37.399 --> 34:40.701
"He died in the chair." What does
this have to do with our little town?

34:40.835 --> 34:43.938
Well, we happen to have
a very significant associate

34:44.072 --> 34:48.143
of a major crime syndicate
living right here in Apalachin.

34:48.277 --> 34:49.578
Mr. Gerimotta.

34:49.710 --> 34:52.813
He lives up the block,
I knew he was a crook.

34:56.717 --> 34:59.287
Oh...
Oh, you're serious, Ed?

34:59.421 --> 35:01.890
I'm dead serious.
Nobody believes me.

35:03.325 --> 35:04.792
But wait a second.

35:04.926 --> 35:08.697
How did you know
Mr. Gerimotta was a kingpin?

35:08.830 --> 35:10.031
Oh...

35:10.165 --> 35:12.033
No, but I am serious.

35:12.167 --> 35:14.937
Now, I'm still puttin'
the pieces together,

35:15.069 --> 35:16.772
but once I do...

35:20.009 --> 35:23.178
I wanna thank you. This was...
This was delicious.

35:23.310 --> 35:26.047
I can't tell you the last
time I had a home-cooked meal.

35:26.181 --> 35:29.518
Oh, well, good.
I'm glad you liked it.

35:31.051 --> 35:32.887
- Are you done? I'll take it. Okay.
- Yeah.

35:33.020 --> 35:35.457
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no, not at all. You've already done too much.

35:35.591 --> 35:37.159
Come on.

35:37.292 --> 35:38.960
Oh, no.
Let me get those, Ed.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.528
- Are you sure you don't need more help?
- No, no, no.

35:41.663 --> 35:43.565
You've already done so much.
Thank you.

35:43.698 --> 35:45.834
Oh, all right. Thank you.
It was really wonderful.

35:45.966 --> 35:47.868
Oh.

35:48.002 --> 35:51.272
- All right, good night.
- Oh, Ed, the kids are upstairs.

35:51.406 --> 35:52.908
- Of course.
- I'm sorry.

35:53.042 --> 35:56.511
- No, I don't know what I was thinkin'. Really.
- Oh, it's okay.

35:56.645 --> 35:59.448
Okay, um,
I'll see you then.

35:59.580 --> 36:01.950
Thanks... Thanks again.

36:05.053 --> 36:07.189
I understand.

36:07.323 --> 36:09.058
Okay.
[speaks Italian].

36:11.792 --> 36:14.395
So, how we lookin'?

36:14.529 --> 36:16.431
Everyone so far
is very honored,

36:16.564 --> 36:18.867
looking forward to
sitting down with you.

36:19.801 --> 36:22.203
Good.
How many we got so far?

36:22.337 --> 36:23.738
Thirty-six confirmed,

36:23.872 --> 36:26.808
still another...
at least another 20 to go.

36:27.743 --> 36:29.812
You better call
Joe the Barber back.

36:29.944 --> 36:32.247
Tell him he's gonna need
a lot of ice.

36:34.315 --> 36:36.951
[upbeat rock playing on radio]

36:47.763 --> 36:49.965
[music stops]

37:06.080 --> 37:07.248
Hello, Joe.

37:08.850 --> 37:11.420
- How you doin'?
- I'm good, how you doin'? Listen.

37:11.553 --> 37:15.324
I'm havin' a few people over at the house
next week. I need some fuckin' fish.

37:15.457 --> 37:17.725
- How many people you talkin'?
- Twenty, 30 people.

37:17.859 --> 37:19.561
Joe, that's a lot
of people.

37:19.694 --> 37:21.396
I have all my top
salespeople coming.

37:21.529 --> 37:24.932
Oh, you call them salesmen.
[chuckles] I'm sorry. I was kidding. Uh...

37:25.065 --> 37:28.370
Uh, cod.
We'll get some cod.

37:28.504 --> 37:29.872
- Cod?
- Yeah, cod.

37:30.004 --> 37:32.273
- You don't want the cod, Joe.
- Why don't I want cod?

37:32.408 --> 37:34.476
[sighs]
It's a beautiful fish.

37:34.609 --> 37:37.645
But it's not good for the grill.
It's too soft. It's gonna fall apart.

37:37.779 --> 37:39.280
- You know what? I didn't think about that.
- Yeah.

37:39.413 --> 37:41.882
All right, let me get, uh, perch.
Let me get some perch.

37:42.017 --> 37:45.319
Perch? Joe, I'm sorry.
It's out of season.

37:45.453 --> 37:47.689
- Out of season?
- Yeah.

37:47.823 --> 37:51.026
All right. All right, uh,
let me get some salmon here.

37:51.158 --> 37:53.561
Please don't get mad.
Don't get mad at me, Joe.

37:53.694 --> 37:56.330
The salmon's crossed off on the board.
I haven't had salmon in six months.

37:56.464 --> 38:00.102
What the fuck do you have?
No salmon, no cod, no perch!

38:00.234 --> 38:02.603
I'm sorry.
But I know what you need.

38:02.738 --> 38:04.239
- What?
- I know what you need, Joe.

38:04.372 --> 38:05.674
- What?
- Swordfish.

38:05.808 --> 38:07.309
- Swordfish?
- Swordfish is what you need.

38:07.442 --> 38:09.042
Nah, I don't want fuckin' swordfish.
It's too fuckin' dry.

38:09.176 --> 38:11.379
Trust me. I sell fish.
You want swordfish.

38:11.513 --> 38:14.681
It's the king of the sea.
You cook it on the grill, low and slow.

38:14.815 --> 38:16.817
Your guests
are gonna love it, Joe.

38:16.951 --> 38:18.520
Wow. Okay.
Uh, all right.

38:18.652 --> 38:21.156
Give me fuckin' swordfish.
Give me, uh, 35 pounds of swordfish.

38:21.288 --> 38:24.993
Thirty-five pounds? Thirty...
What do I look like?

38:25.127 --> 38:27.661
What do you mean? You fuckin' sell
fish, I need fish, 35 pounds.

38:27.796 --> 38:30.732
Yeah, but 35 pounds is a lot of fish.
What do I look like, the ocean?

38:30.864 --> 38:33.502
All right, listen, listen.

38:33.634 --> 38:36.138
- [bills rustling]
- Here's $300.

38:36.270 --> 38:39.173
Get me my fuckin' 35 pounds
of swordfish, okay?

38:39.308 --> 38:41.043
I'll call you.
I need it delivered to the house.

38:41.176 --> 38:43.178
Joe, you're getting 40 pounds.
That's right, Joe.

38:43.310 --> 38:46.047
- Anything for you, Joe. Joe the king!
- All right.

38:58.625 --> 39:00.394
[engine starts]

39:00.529 --> 39:02.731
[pop music plays
on radio]

39:07.335 --> 39:09.103
[engine starts]

39:13.776 --> 39:15.243
Okay.

39:16.477 --> 39:18.180
Okay, I'm sorry
too, Meyer.

39:18.312 --> 39:20.448
We would be honored
to have you.

39:23.685 --> 39:26.955
- So?
- Says he thinks it's a bad idea.

39:30.192 --> 39:31.993
- You agree with him?
- No.

39:32.127 --> 39:36.663
I mean, I understand what he's
sayin', but it's Meyer.

39:36.797 --> 39:38.533
You think this is a bad idea.

39:38.667 --> 39:42.136
Not at all, Don. I would've said
somethin' if I thought that.

39:42.270 --> 39:46.207
I'm just sayin',
I understand what he's thinking.

39:51.879 --> 39:54.214
I trust that you know
how important this is.

39:54.348 --> 39:55.216
I do.

39:55.350 --> 39:57.752
The most important thing
I ever did.

40:05.393 --> 40:07.362
How many we got now?

40:07.495 --> 40:09.064
About 50.

40:09.797 --> 40:12.801
[chuckles] That's good.

40:12.933 --> 40:16.872
Yeah, I know, Mike... I know you're gonna
handle this. I know you're gonna do it.

40:19.140 --> 40:20.741
You know what?
You call this, uh,

40:20.875 --> 40:23.078
this here Meyer back
in a couple of days.

40:23.210 --> 40:26.214
Maybe he's gonna change
his mind, you know?

40:26.346 --> 40:28.683
We're gonna give Lucky
a call in Italy.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.953
Put some pressure on him.

40:35.323 --> 40:36.857
[dialing]

40:36.991 --> 40:40.328
- [phone ringing]
- Fuck. Hello?

40:40.462 --> 40:42.464
[Mike] <i>So we're up
to about 50.</i>

40:42.598 --> 40:45.467
- <i>You okay with that?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's no problem.

40:45.600 --> 40:49.070
<i>Good. And get some rooms
somewhere the night before.</i>

40:49.203 --> 40:51.605
- <i>That gonna be a problem?</i>
- No problem. I'll take care of it.

40:51.739 --> 40:53.208
<i>Good.
And remember,</i>

40:53.341 --> 40:56.044
<i>Don Vitone needs some time
with the other guys,</i>

40:56.178 --> 40:58.246
<i>a private room
away from everybody.</i>

40:58.379 --> 41:00.214
Mike, I got
the perfect room for him.

41:00.348 --> 41:02.750
<i>Sure you can
handle this, Joe?</i>

41:02.884 --> 41:04.519
<i>It's a huge opportunity,
you know.</i>

41:04.652 --> 41:06.453
Absolutely.

41:06.587 --> 41:09.757
And we're very honored
to host Don Vito in our home.

41:09.892 --> 41:11.625
<i>Good. See you
in a couple days.</i>

41:11.759 --> 41:13.962
All right, thanks, Mike.

41:16.931 --> 41:18.934
- [chuckles]
- What?

41:19.067 --> 41:21.736
- Fifty.
- Fifty?

41:21.870 --> 41:24.473
Oh, my God.

41:24.605 --> 41:25.806
Fifty people?

41:25.940 --> 41:29.176
That's a lot
of fuckin' people, Joe.

41:29.310 --> 41:30.946
I know.

41:45.660 --> 41:47.462
[Ed] Bootlegging.

41:57.471 --> 41:59.174
Galante.

42:18.125 --> 42:21.095
Ed, come on. What are you doin'?
Let it go.

42:21.228 --> 42:23.163
Come on. Lieutenant Lane...
the guy's a wet rag.

42:23.297 --> 42:24.498
Yeah.

42:25.801 --> 42:27.402
How come you aren't
our lieutenant?

42:27.535 --> 42:29.770
Huh? You been with the
force, what, 15 years?

42:30.538 --> 42:32.540
It's not as easy
as you think, Vince.

42:32.674 --> 42:34.275
Why?

42:34.408 --> 42:36.344
I got Lane breathing
down my neck.

42:36.477 --> 42:39.080
There you go.
It is a little odd, Ed,

42:39.214 --> 42:40.982
that you're always doing
all this research.

42:41.114 --> 42:43.417
- Really?
- Really.

42:44.652 --> 42:47.488
You know what? I gotta...
I gotta make a phone call.

42:47.622 --> 42:49.556
To who?

42:49.690 --> 42:53.395
Okay, what do we feel
like tonight, gang?

42:54.661 --> 42:56.163
<i>Tom Sawyer.</i>

42:56.297 --> 42:59.033
[Sarah]
Not again, please, Mommy?

42:59.167 --> 43:01.536
Can you read
<i>Kate's First Mate?</i>

43:01.669 --> 43:04.805
[June]
Yeah, please, Mommy.

43:04.939 --> 43:07.209
[Billy]
Ew. That's a girls' book.

43:07.341 --> 43:09.376
No, Billy.
It's not a girls' book

43:09.509 --> 43:12.212
just because the main
character is a girl.

43:12.346 --> 43:14.281
I think
you would like it.

43:14.415 --> 43:16.250
But how 'bout we let
the girls pick tonight?

43:16.384 --> 43:18.253
We read <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
last night.

43:18.386 --> 43:22.757
But Dad always used to
read <i>Tom Sawyer</i> to me.

43:22.890 --> 43:25.059
Oh, I know.

43:26.593 --> 43:28.662
Let's... Let's...

43:28.796 --> 43:32.100
Let's try <i>Jellyfish Island</i>
tonight, okay?

43:42.410 --> 43:46.313
"Don't let your power be
silenced by that rusty old fear.

43:46.448 --> 43:49.049
Your choice
is your voice.

43:49.183 --> 43:51.987
- Believe in yourself, my dear."
- [phone ringing]

44:02.062 --> 44:04.332
[ringing continues]

44:08.002 --> 44:09.637
- Hello?
- [Ed] <i>Hello, Natalie?</i>

44:10.337 --> 44:12.073
I hope I'm not callin'
too late.

44:12.207 --> 44:15.844
No, no. Hi Ed.
I-I just put the kids to bed.

44:15.977 --> 44:17.178
Is everything okay?

44:17.310 --> 44:20.314
- Yeah, everything's fine.
- <i>Okay.</i>

44:21.681 --> 44:23.185
What's up?

44:24.551 --> 44:26.620
I just wanted to apologize
for last night.

44:26.754 --> 44:31.157
No, no, no. No. No. You don't...
You don't have to apologize.

44:31.292 --> 44:33.694
Yeah, well, you know...

44:38.799 --> 44:40.768
Is there anything else?

44:41.636 --> 44:43.171
Yeah, um...

44:44.105 --> 44:45.707
I'd like to maybe

44:45.839 --> 44:49.243
take you out to dinner sometime,
to a restaurant.

44:49.377 --> 44:53.348
Yes, yes. Um, yeah.
I would like that.

44:54.716 --> 44:56.384
Okay, good.

44:56.517 --> 44:58.886
<i>You have somewhere in mind?</i>

44:59.020 --> 45:00.388
Yeah, how about Lupo's?

45:00.522 --> 45:03.391
Yeah, haven't been there
in quite a while.

45:03.524 --> 45:06.627
<i>How does tomorrow work?</i>

45:06.761 --> 45:08.396
<i>Say, 6:00?</i>

45:08.529 --> 45:11.065
Um, yeah.
That... That sounds great.

45:11.198 --> 45:12.499
All right.

45:12.634 --> 45:16.203
Well, um,
I'll pick you up at 5:30.

45:16.337 --> 45:18.907
And let me know
in case anything changes.

45:19.040 --> 45:22.109
Yeah, okay.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

45:22.243 --> 45:24.279
Okay. Good night.

45:26.747 --> 45:28.549
[phone hangs up]

45:38.993 --> 45:40.862
- All right?
- Thanks.

45:40.995 --> 45:43.632
[upbeat music playing
on radio]

45:46.768 --> 45:48.636
[engine stops]

45:48.770 --> 45:50.438
Benny.

45:50.571 --> 45:52.840
Where you been?
I been lookin' all over for you.

45:52.973 --> 45:55.575
Joe, I told you on the phone I
can't sell to you. I'm wholesale.

45:55.710 --> 45:57.846
You know, it's a county
regulation, it's not me.

45:57.978 --> 45:59.647
County regulations,
my ass.

45:59.781 --> 46:01.949
I'm ordering through my company.
It's a big fuckin' order, Benny.

46:02.082 --> 46:04.451
Look, if the USDA finds out about
this, I could lose my license.

46:04.585 --> 46:06.620
[Joe] How the fuck
are they gonna find out?

46:06.754 --> 46:08.256
[engine stops]

46:08.388 --> 46:10.257
All right, all right,
all right. I get this.

46:10.390 --> 46:12.593
All right. Here.

46:17.131 --> 46:19.366
Come on. What do you got over here?
What do you got today?

46:19.500 --> 46:21.402
I got, uh, steaks.
There's ten pounds in each box.

46:21.535 --> 46:23.404
Ten pounds. All right,
give me, uh, eight of those.

46:23.538 --> 46:26.942
You tryin' to feed the 10th Infantry
Division? What do you need those steaks for?

46:27.075 --> 46:30.011
I got all my fuckin' top top sales
guys comin'. What the fuck do you care?

46:30.143 --> 46:32.680
I care because this is the only
meat I got for the whole week.

46:32.814 --> 46:36.017
- They ain't deliverin' till next week.
- All right.

46:36.151 --> 46:38.319
Here.
What's in the other box?

46:38.453 --> 46:40.288
No, that box you can't have.
That's...

46:40.422 --> 46:43.224
I promised my wife. It's pork chops
in there, and you can't have 'em.

46:43.357 --> 46:46.694
I love pork chops. Gimme, uh...
Gimme 50 of those.

46:47.495 --> 46:49.064
You're killin' me, Joe.
Come on, please.

46:49.196 --> 46:52.132
- I can't, I can't...
- Take the fuckin' week off!

46:52.265 --> 46:53.901
I don't want the week off.

46:54.035 --> 46:57.705
Benny, take the fuckin' week off.
Go fishin'. Do somethin'.

46:57.839 --> 46:59.707
- All right...
- If you only knew who this is for.

46:59.839 --> 47:02.676
- Who do you mean by that?
- You don't want to know, you fuck. Trust me.

47:02.810 --> 47:04.411
Are those sausages?

47:04.544 --> 47:06.580
- Yeah, blood sausages.
- All right, here. Take this... $200.

47:06.714 --> 47:08.984
Bring the fuckin' sausages
to my house tomorrow.

47:09.116 --> 47:10.752
One o'clock.
Benny, don't fuck around.

47:11.386 --> 47:12.687
Thanks, Benny.

47:14.455 --> 47:16.524
My wife will be home
at one o'clock.

47:17.257 --> 47:18.993
Don't fuck around.

47:19.127 --> 47:21.196
- [knock at door]
- Come in.

47:21.328 --> 47:23.363
- Lieutenant, can I have a word?
- Sit down.

47:23.497 --> 47:25.632
I'll call you
right back.

47:25.765 --> 47:27.468
[clears throat]

47:27.602 --> 47:29.603
I just happened to be
up on McFall Road.

47:29.736 --> 47:32.339
Don't blow smoke
up my ass, Croswell.

47:32.473 --> 47:33.908
We both know
why you were up there.

47:34.040 --> 47:36.678
You think you got somethin'
on Joe Barbara, don't you?

47:36.810 --> 47:39.613
Yes. He's got numerous
mob associations

47:39.747 --> 47:42.750
in Scranton, Pittston,
New York City.

47:42.882 --> 47:46.187
And you remember that Carmine Galante?
He's one of the biggest.

47:46.319 --> 47:48.256
Yes, we know all that,
Sergeant,

47:48.388 --> 47:51.157
but what has Joe Barbara
actually done?

47:51.292 --> 47:55.462
He's got a 1952
Cadillac Fleetwood.

47:55.596 --> 47:57.265
That retails for $4,000.

47:57.397 --> 48:01.434
He's also got a Chrysler Imperial
convertible. That's another $4,000.

48:01.569 --> 48:03.904
He's got a mansion
on 18 acres

48:04.038 --> 48:06.774
with four buildings on it
and an outdoor barbecue.

48:06.908 --> 48:10.344
You're telling me that he gets
all this from selling ginger ale?

48:10.477 --> 48:13.213
You seem to know a lot
about Joe Barbara.

48:13.346 --> 48:15.649
But I'll have you know
Mr. Barbara

48:15.783 --> 48:18.385
happens to be a pillar
in this community.

48:18.520 --> 48:20.688
You're doin' this without
my sanction and approval,

48:20.821 --> 48:23.323
which I can assure you
will not be forthcoming

48:23.457 --> 48:27.161
without a little something
called evidence.

48:27.294 --> 48:28.962
Am I makin' myself clear?

48:29.096 --> 48:30.832
Yes sir.

48:30.966 --> 48:32.667
Good.

48:32.799 --> 48:35.602
Here. I want you
to follow up on this.

48:35.736 --> 48:38.606
Break-in at a bakery
in Binghamton last night.

48:43.410 --> 48:46.346
Do me a favor, watch the fuckin' ladder?
I don't wanna break my neck here.

48:46.480 --> 48:48.616
Yeah. You got it, boss.

48:49.651 --> 48:51.752
- What are you doing?
- You said to watch it.

48:51.886 --> 48:54.489
Hold the fuckin' ladder,
would you?

48:58.192 --> 49:02.463
Hey boss, I can see you're
connectin' the wrong wires.

49:02.997 --> 49:04.732
Mind your own business.

49:04.866 --> 49:06.401
- Josephine!
- What?

49:06.533 --> 49:08.401
- Come here for a second.
- I'm busy.

49:08.535 --> 49:09.836
Jo, five seconds.

49:09.971 --> 49:11.539
- I need you to do somethin'.
- What?

49:11.672 --> 49:13.241
- Turn that light on for me, please.
- Which one?

49:13.373 --> 49:16.011
That one right there. Turn it on.
It should be working.

49:19.480 --> 49:22.516
- What the fuck was that? What'd you do?
- I did what you told me to do.

49:22.649 --> 49:25.318
You're fuckin' drivin' me crazy!
Help me down!

49:25.453 --> 49:27.022
Oh, my God.

49:29.156 --> 49:30.625
I'll be right back.

49:32.826 --> 49:34.828
What are you
in the mood for?

49:34.962 --> 49:37.297
Uh, hmm.

49:37.431 --> 49:39.834
Well, I'm thinking
the spaghetti tarantina,

49:39.966 --> 49:42.736
although I'll probably
be disappointed.

49:42.870 --> 49:45.439
- [chuckles]
- Why disappointed?

49:45.573 --> 49:48.042
Oh... Oh, that
came out wrong.

49:49.042 --> 49:51.779
- I'm not a snob, I promise.
- Oh, it's okay.

49:51.913 --> 49:55.850
It's just that I come from a long
line of Tuscan food aficionados.

49:55.982 --> 49:58.251
- I didn't know you were Italian.
- Mm-hmm.

49:58.386 --> 50:01.323
Well, I know with a name
like Passatino...

50:01.455 --> 50:04.625
Yeah, um...
No, my maiden name is DiVincenzo.

50:04.759 --> 50:07.428
Well, that is
certainly Italian, yeah.

50:07.562 --> 50:09.663
- Italian.
- Yeah.

50:09.797 --> 50:13.901
It's actually Tuscano.
Um, my family comes from Luca.

50:14.035 --> 50:16.703
- Mm.
- You have no idea where that is, do you?

50:16.837 --> 50:18.372
No.

50:18.506 --> 50:21.209
My family hails
from Nebraska, so...

50:21.341 --> 50:23.610
- Good evening.
- Hi.

50:23.745 --> 50:26.247
Do you have any
questions about the menu?

50:26.379 --> 50:27.481
- N-No.
- No?

50:27.614 --> 50:29.817
Um, I think I'll just have
the calamari

50:29.950 --> 50:31.585
and then, uh,
spaghetti tarantina.

50:31.718 --> 50:34.454
Excellent choice.
And for you, sir?

50:34.587 --> 50:36.022
I'm gonna have the steak.

50:36.156 --> 50:38.425
I'm so sorry, sir,
but we're actually out of the steak.

50:38.558 --> 50:40.861
Oh. Well,

50:40.995 --> 50:43.230
in that case,
I'll take the pork chops.

50:43.364 --> 50:47.334
My deepest apologies, sir, but we're
actually out of the pork chop as well.

50:47.468 --> 50:48.969
Really?

50:49.103 --> 50:51.806
Yes. There seems to be an issue
with our meat distributor.

50:51.939 --> 50:53.475
Oh.

50:53.607 --> 50:57.879
Okay, well, um... just,
I'll have the spaghetti.

50:58.011 --> 51:02.082
- Excellent choice. Any appetizers for you?
- No, thank you.

51:02.216 --> 51:03.718
Very well.

51:10.091 --> 51:12.226
You okay, Ed?

51:12.359 --> 51:14.128
Yeah. Uh...

51:15.230 --> 51:18.065
I was just really
looking forward to a steak.

51:19.732 --> 51:22.169
- Who doesn't love spaghetti?
- Yeah.

51:27.040 --> 51:29.276
How's the wine?

51:29.410 --> 51:31.112
It's very good,
thank you.

51:31.245 --> 51:33.647
Why didn't you tell me you know
how to fix the electricity?

51:33.781 --> 51:36.316
I tried to, boss,
but you told me to mind my own business.

51:36.451 --> 51:38.585
Just fix the fuckin' fuse,
would you?

51:38.718 --> 51:40.754
Yeah, no problem, boss.

51:40.888 --> 51:44.792
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen if
this house is not ready for the barbecue?

51:44.926 --> 51:48.462
They ransack the house,
and then they shoot us in cold blood.

51:48.596 --> 51:52.233
No, they shoot us in cold blood,
and then they ransack the house.

51:52.366 --> 51:55.102
- Are you fuckin' kidding me right now?
- Most likely,

51:55.236 --> 51:58.172
if they do it, they're gonna do
it with a model Remington 870.

51:58.306 --> 52:01.275
I'll shove the Remington up your ass!
Fix the fuckin' fuse!

52:01.408 --> 52:03.478
- [Jo] Joe, I need you.
- I'm coming!

52:03.611 --> 52:06.446
I'll be right fuckin' back.
This shit better be fuckin' fixed.

52:06.580 --> 52:08.682
So, how's
that big case going?

52:10.417 --> 52:13.453
- Not great.
- Oh, no. Why?

52:13.587 --> 52:15.923
The lieutenant shut me down.

52:16.056 --> 52:18.026
- Oh, dear.
- Yeah.

52:18.158 --> 52:19.258
Why did he do that?

52:19.960 --> 52:21.963
He just doesn't see
what I see.

52:22.096 --> 52:26.267
- What is it that you see?
- It's just a feeling.

52:26.399 --> 52:28.335
I know that something big

52:28.469 --> 52:30.904
is gonna go down
right here in Apalachin.

52:31.038 --> 52:32.605
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:32.739 --> 52:35.209
And if the lieutenant
would just back me up...

52:35.343 --> 52:38.846
Well, I believe in you, Ed.
You keep fighting.

52:53.127 --> 52:54.762
[engine stops]

53:05.471 --> 53:07.575
Oh, wait. Wait.

53:11.210 --> 53:14.314
Uh, I gotta go back inside.
I gotta... Okay?

53:14.448 --> 53:17.584
- I understand.
- Thank you for dinner.

53:17.718 --> 53:20.220
I'd really like to take
you out again sometime.

53:20.353 --> 53:22.390
Yes. Yeah.

53:22.522 --> 53:24.825
- Okay.
- Let me walk you to the door.

53:54.254 --> 53:56.190
[engine starts]

54:01.861 --> 54:04.630
Really?
Uh, how many, Marge?

54:04.765 --> 54:06.667
<i>Oh, I don't know.
Maybe two dozen.</i>

54:06.801 --> 54:10.103
Well, listen, I'm gonna send Ed
over to take a look at it, okay?

54:10.238 --> 54:13.774
- <i>That would be great if you could send somebody over.</i>
- All right, Margie.

54:14.709 --> 54:16.576
- Hmm.
- What can I do for you, boss?

54:16.710 --> 54:20.949
Gettin' several reports of bad
checks over at the High Way Motel.

54:22.683 --> 54:26.786
I want you to, uh,
go over there and sort it all out, okay?

54:26.921 --> 54:29.189
Yes sir, but I really...

54:29.323 --> 54:32.259
I need to talk to you.
I think I'm onto something big here.

54:32.393 --> 54:35.496
So? What's the latest
with you and Natalie?

54:35.629 --> 54:37.930
That's really none
of your business, Vince.

54:38.064 --> 54:40.433
I'm sorry, Ed.
I didn't mean to pry.

54:40.567 --> 54:42.603
That's all right.
It's just...

54:44.105 --> 54:45.973
- We're doin' just fine.
- That's great.

54:46.105 --> 54:48.709
- Hey, Ed, I'm happy to hear that.
- Thanks.

54:48.841 --> 54:50.643
- Are you gonna marry her?
- Vince!

54:50.777 --> 54:53.147
No, I'm...
Look, Ed, I'm sorry.

54:53.281 --> 54:56.616
I'm just asking 'cause my girl keeps
badgering me about gettin' hitched.

54:56.750 --> 54:58.953
- Yeah, and what's the problem?
- I just...

54:59.085 --> 55:01.421
I don't know if I'm ready
for all that, you know?

55:01.556 --> 55:03.891
- Still a little bit of a tomcat, right?
- [chuckles]

55:04.024 --> 55:06.828
If it ain't broke, why fix it? But,
no, no, that's not good enough for her.

55:06.960 --> 55:10.531
She wants the ring
and the flowers and the dress.

55:10.663 --> 55:13.801
Well, it sounds like she wants a wedding
more than she wants to be married.

55:13.933 --> 55:15.402
Yeah... Ed, yes.

55:15.535 --> 55:18.371
That's it exactly.
So what am I supposed to do now?

55:18.506 --> 55:21.475
- Why are you askin' me?
- Well, 'cause you've been through all this.

55:21.609 --> 55:23.210
You know,
I was divorced, Vince.

55:23.343 --> 55:25.078
Ed, that's what makes you
an expert, right?

55:25.212 --> 55:27.580
You know better
than anybody else, so...

55:27.714 --> 55:29.549
Is being married hard?

55:29.683 --> 55:32.186
Uh, it's harder
than getting divorced.

55:32.319 --> 55:34.154
That's what...

55:34.288 --> 55:35.657
Oh.

55:45.466 --> 55:46.834
[door bells jangle]

55:46.966 --> 55:49.202
- Hey, Margie.
- Hi, Mr. Barbara. What can I do for you?

55:49.335 --> 55:51.805
- I need some rooms.
- Sure. How many?

55:51.939 --> 55:53.808
- How many you got?
- Pardon?

55:53.940 --> 55:56.676
- I need a lot of rooms. How many you got?
- Um...

55:56.810 --> 55:58.678
I think we have
17 available.

55:58.812 --> 56:00.114
I'll take 'em.

56:00.247 --> 56:01.847
Okay, and for
how many nights?

56:01.982 --> 56:03.183
- Just one night.
- All right.

56:03.317 --> 56:05.152
You gonna be puttin' down
a deposit?

56:05.285 --> 56:07.321
No, I'll pay cash right now.
How much?

56:07.455 --> 56:10.391
Um, that comes to 482, even.

56:13.493 --> 56:16.395
- Do you know whose car that is?
- No, whose is it?

56:16.529 --> 56:18.298
That's Joe Barbara's Cadillac.

56:18.431 --> 56:20.134
[Vince] That's his?

56:24.270 --> 56:26.172
Here's 500.
Keep the change.

56:26.306 --> 56:29.877
- Oh, thanks, Mr. Barbara.
- Yeah, no problem.

56:37.951 --> 56:39.253
[whispers] Come on!

56:40.421 --> 56:42.123
I don't have all the rooms
ready just yet,

56:42.256 --> 56:44.190
so you have to pick up
the keys tomorrow morning.

56:44.323 --> 56:46.225
Are you serious?
You're killin' me.

56:46.359 --> 56:49.462
- Uh, could you just leave the keys over here for me?
- Oh, sure.

56:49.596 --> 56:52.065
You can just fill out one of these
forms with all the guests' names,

56:52.200 --> 56:53.567
and I'll get everything
sorted for you.

56:53.701 --> 56:55.236
Nah, I can't remember
the names.

56:55.368 --> 56:58.939
Uh, can I have an
associate come pick 'em up?

56:59.073 --> 57:01.674
- [Margie] That'll work.
- All right, then I'll send somebody.

57:01.808 --> 57:04.477
Put it under
Galante, Carmine.

57:04.611 --> 57:06.580
Okay.

57:06.714 --> 57:08.315
Fuckin' flies.

57:08.448 --> 57:10.616
All right, he'll be here
11:30, 12:00.

57:10.750 --> 57:12.185
- You'll be here, right?
- I will.

57:12.319 --> 57:14.221
- I have 17 rooms.
- I've got it.

57:14.355 --> 57:17.123
- I appreciate it. Good to see you, Margie.
- Bye, Mr. Barbara.

57:17.257 --> 57:19.227
- Bye.
- [door bells jangle]

57:19.359 --> 57:21.228
[door closes]

57:26.299 --> 57:28.602
Okay.

57:28.736 --> 57:31.738
- Marge.
- Geez! Ed, you scared the bejesus out of me.

57:31.872 --> 57:35.642
I'm sorry about that.
Uh, can I see this, uh, booking slip?

57:35.776 --> 57:37.944
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

57:38.078 --> 57:40.080
What are you lookin' for?

57:40.214 --> 57:43.183
Mr. Barbara is booking up
every room tomorrow?

57:43.317 --> 57:45.986
- Yeah.
- Well, don't you find that to be strange?

57:46.118 --> 57:49.388
Not really. Mr. Barbara's
always bookin' rooms here.

57:49.522 --> 57:53.093
Never this many though.
He must be havin' a big party.

57:53.227 --> 57:54.627
[chuckles]

57:54.761 --> 57:57.530
Uh, Margie, can I keep this booking slip?
I'll get it back to you.

57:57.663 --> 58:00.399
- Oh, sure thing, Ed.
- Hey, what about the bounced checks?

58:00.533 --> 58:02.635
Oh, yeah. Um,
do you have those bounced checks?

58:02.768 --> 58:04.071
Oh, gosh. Yeah.

58:04.205 --> 58:07.007
Uh, Vince here's
gonna fill out a report.

58:07.140 --> 58:08.508
- I'll be right back.
- But I've never actually...

58:08.642 --> 58:10.676
- I gotta go to the station.
- No, I really have no idea...

58:10.810 --> 58:12.814
You can do this, man.
Come on.

58:13.946 --> 58:16.816
- Hi.
- Hey, Margie.

58:16.950 --> 58:19.085
- Kind of a lot.
- No, that's okay. It's, uh...

58:19.218 --> 58:21.353
Policeman's job
is never done, right?

58:21.488 --> 58:23.457
I don't wanna waste
too much of your time.

58:23.589 --> 58:26.559
No, it's fine. I'm happy to do it.
Hey, I like the, uh...

58:26.692 --> 58:28.627
- What?
- The polka dot, um... What is that called, actually?

58:28.761 --> 58:31.765
- It's just a scarf.
- Just a scarf. That's all... [laughs]

58:31.899 --> 58:34.368
- It's just a hat.
- I like it!

58:34.502 --> 58:37.536
Yeah. Ah, thanks. Yeah, it's a real...
Just got it. It's a real wing-dinger.

58:37.671 --> 58:39.607
- Sir. Sir.
- What now?

58:39.739 --> 58:42.977
I know you told me to drop this,
but I'm workin' on somethin' big.

58:43.109 --> 58:45.445
- Oh, Christ. What is it?
- It's Barbara.

58:45.578 --> 58:48.850
He's workin' on somethin'
that's gonna be huge.

58:48.982 --> 58:50.716
Are you kidding me?
'Cause I thought I told you

58:50.850 --> 58:52.486
to forget about all this,
didn't I?

58:52.620 --> 58:54.455
I know, but Barbara's
runnin' around town,

58:54.587 --> 58:57.457
buying up all the fish and
meat he can get his hands on.

58:57.591 --> 59:00.460
I mean, I went to Lupo's last night.
I couldn't even get a steak.

59:00.593 --> 59:02.595
There is no meat left
in this whole town.

59:02.730 --> 59:06.366
So what? Maybe he's throwin' a...
wedding or somethin'.

59:06.500 --> 59:08.635
But he's buying directly
from the distributor.

59:08.768 --> 59:11.971
That's illegal. We can open
up a case based on that alone.

59:12.105 --> 59:16.376
Please tell me you got something
more than a fish and game violation.

59:16.509 --> 59:19.546
I do. I just got back
from the High Way Motel,

59:20.747 --> 59:24.250
and Barbara has booked up
every room for tomorrow night.

59:24.384 --> 59:26.419
And guess who he's got
pickin' up the keys.

59:26.553 --> 59:29.022
- Who?
- Galante.

59:31.091 --> 59:32.593
Carmine Galante?

59:32.725 --> 59:34.894
That gangster I picked up
about six months ago.

59:35.029 --> 59:39.467
Remember, he got mysteriously
bailed out by some state judge?

59:41.401 --> 59:42.603
- [sighs]
- Listen, we all know

59:42.736 --> 59:45.138
that Barbara's got ties
to organized crime.

59:45.272 --> 59:48.042
But Carmine Galante's
just one of 'em.

59:48.642 --> 59:50.176
I...

59:50.310 --> 59:52.980
can't believe I'm gonna
say this, but fine.

59:53.113 --> 59:55.149
Sit on Barbara

59:55.281 --> 59:57.584
and come up with
some goddamn evidence!

59:57.718 --> 01:00:00.687
Yes, sir. I'll come up
with some solid evidence.

01:00:00.821 --> 01:00:03.690
- Thank you, sir.
- Solid evidence.

01:00:03.823 --> 01:00:07.894
- It's a real hoot talkin' to you, Margie.
- [giggling]

01:00:08.027 --> 01:00:09.730
- Well, it is.
- Wow.

01:00:09.864 --> 01:00:12.632
- Yeah.
- I was always wondering how long have you been a cop.

01:00:12.765 --> 01:00:15.335
Oh, right. Well,
about, uh, seven years now.

01:00:15.468 --> 01:00:17.303
- Yeah, my uncle got me the job. Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

01:00:17.437 --> 01:00:19.606
You've never had to use your
gun on anybody, though, right?

01:00:19.739 --> 01:00:21.442
Oh, you betcha, sure.
Plenty of times, yeah.

01:00:21.575 --> 01:00:23.843
- Really?
- Yeah. One time, actually,

01:00:23.977 --> 01:00:26.246
to help save
a pretty girl like you.

01:00:26.379 --> 01:00:28.214
- Oh! Wow.
- Yeah, well...

01:00:28.348 --> 01:00:30.584
- [door bells jangle]
- So, these checks look very fishy.

01:00:30.718 --> 01:00:32.853
- We gotta go.
- What about the bounced checks here, though?

01:00:32.986 --> 01:00:35.154
- Bring 'em with you. Come on, Vince, let's go.
- Okay.

01:00:35.288 --> 01:00:37.525
- All right, Margie. Oh, okay, yep.
- Be safe.

01:00:39.091 --> 01:00:40.860
- We got the green light.
- For what?

01:00:40.995 --> 01:00:44.064
Listen closely, Vince.
This is how it's gonna go down.

01:00:44.198 --> 01:00:46.900
I need you to show up at that
motel first thing in the morning.

01:00:47.033 --> 01:00:50.236
Ed, are you sure? You think somethin'
big is gonna happen in our town?

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:52.506
- I'm positive.
- Really?

01:00:52.638 --> 01:00:54.040
- You can tell.
- How?

01:00:54.174 --> 01:00:57.044
You look around. Look at Joe Barbara.
Look at the way he's acting.

01:00:57.178 --> 01:00:59.647
He's buying up all the meat in town.
It's just...

01:00:59.779 --> 01:01:02.114
There's too many coincidences.
That Carmen Galante.

01:01:02.248 --> 01:01:04.049
Oh, that guy doesn't seem
like a nice fellow.

01:01:04.183 --> 01:01:06.053
Well, he's up to no good.
I know it.

01:01:06.185 --> 01:01:08.421
[piano playing]

01:01:11.591 --> 01:01:14.527
- Are we over our head over here?
- Shh!

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.162
[chuckles]

01:01:16.296 --> 01:01:18.732
It's gonna be one
for the ages.

01:01:19.765 --> 01:01:23.136
- From your mouth to God's ears.
- Oh, he's listening.

01:01:26.506 --> 01:01:29.876
Thank you...
for all this.

01:01:30.009 --> 01:01:32.013
Really appreciate it.

01:01:33.647 --> 01:01:35.315
One shot.

01:01:44.859 --> 01:01:46.227
<i>Salute.</i>

01:01:50.462 --> 01:01:52.698
Look at
this fuckin' place.

01:01:52.832 --> 01:01:56.069
We're gonna have 100 people over here in
a couple days. Can you believe this shit?

01:01:56.203 --> 01:01:57.638
I'm ready.

01:01:59.073 --> 01:02:01.007
We better be fuckin' ready.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.410
- We're not ready, we're dead.
- Relax.

01:02:04.743 --> 01:02:06.446
[chuckles]

01:02:08.748 --> 01:02:10.517
See what happens.

01:02:21.861 --> 01:02:23.696
They're delicious.

01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:33.174
I made you sandwiches to take today.
Just, you know,

01:02:33.306 --> 01:02:36.009
who knows when you're gonna get to
eat, and so...

01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:38.145
- Thank you.
- I'll get 'em.

01:02:44.951 --> 01:02:46.520
It's gonna be all right.

01:02:46.652 --> 01:02:48.254
I hope so.

01:02:50.757 --> 01:02:52.393
Thanks for lunch.

01:03:41.942 --> 01:03:43.677
[engine stops]

01:03:52.819 --> 01:03:54.654
[car door closes]

01:04:23.183 --> 01:04:26.219
- Vince, you there?
- [radio static]

01:04:26.587 --> 01:04:27.721
Vince.

01:04:27.855 --> 01:04:30.457
[Vince] <i>Hey, Ed.
How's it lookin' up there?</i>

01:04:32.058 --> 01:04:35.495
Yeah, nobody's out here.
It's still early though.

01:04:35.629 --> 01:04:39.466
- How 'bout you?
- <i>Yeah, same. Not much happenin'.</i>

01:04:39.598 --> 01:04:43.203
All right, well,
stay alert.

01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:45.939
They'll be
showin' up soon.

01:04:48.308 --> 01:04:50.209
And if you see anything,
give me a call.

01:04:50.343 --> 01:04:52.279
<i>All right, copy that.</i>

01:04:53.145 --> 01:04:55.381
[humming tune]

01:05:22.475 --> 01:05:24.712
[vehicle approaching]

01:05:27.348 --> 01:05:28.882
Bingo.

01:05:35.922 --> 01:05:37.524
[engine stops]

01:05:40.393 --> 01:05:42.997
- How we lookin'?
- Watch me.

01:05:45.631 --> 01:05:48.033
Where have you been?

01:05:48.167 --> 01:05:50.036
You said 12:00, boss.

01:05:50.169 --> 01:05:51.604
It's 12:01!
You're a minute late!

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:53.540
Do me a favor,
start settin' up the bar.

01:05:53.674 --> 01:05:56.142
Please. They're gonna be
all here in about a minute.

01:05:56.276 --> 01:05:58.178
Everything's good.
Outta my kitchen.

01:05:58.310 --> 01:06:00.446
Okay. Let me know
if you need me.

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.750
Ang, how's the caponata?

01:06:02.882 --> 01:06:05.151
- It's almost ready.
- All right. Maria, gnocchi?

01:06:05.285 --> 01:06:06.819
Ready.
Right over here, drying.

01:06:06.953 --> 01:06:09.155
All right, but put it in the fridge.
It'll melt in this heat.

01:06:09.288 --> 01:06:10.689
There's no room
in the fridge.

01:06:10.823 --> 01:06:13.527
- Well, put it in the fridge in the garage.
- You got it.

01:06:15.728 --> 01:06:18.897
Dominick? Dominick,
why is that table not set up?

01:06:19.031 --> 01:06:20.933
Didn't I tell you to
set up the fuckin' table?

01:06:21.067 --> 01:06:24.770
Vito Genovese is gonna be here in an hour.
Why is the table not set up?

01:06:24.904 --> 01:06:26.973
- What about the bar?
- What bar?

01:06:27.107 --> 01:06:30.210
The bar. You said you'd drown
me in the Susquehanna River

01:06:30.343 --> 01:06:32.678
if I didn't
set up the bar first.

01:06:32.812 --> 01:06:35.281
You kidding me right now?
Stop busting my balls about the bar!

01:06:35.415 --> 01:06:36.783
Can you please set up
the fuckin' table?

01:06:36.917 --> 01:06:38.884
I need plates, drinks, everything set up.
Would you?

01:06:39.018 --> 01:06:41.254
- What about the bar?
- Stop with the fuckin' bar!

01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:43.623
Go set up the fuckin'
goddamn table!

01:06:45.558 --> 01:06:47.928
Joe, I need you.
Come try the sauce.

01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.263
What the fuck
is wrong with this guy?

01:06:50.397 --> 01:06:52.532
Come, come, come.

01:06:52.665 --> 01:06:54.567
- It's unbelievable.
- It's unbelievable?

01:06:54.701 --> 01:06:57.638
- Yeah, it's unbelievable.
- Better be unbelievable.

01:07:15.388 --> 01:07:17.024
[engine stops]

01:07:19.459 --> 01:07:20.928
[door closes]

01:07:25.498 --> 01:07:28.535
Yeah, I know. The guy hasn't
fuckin' called me back in two days.

01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:30.804
- What am I supposed to fuckin' do?
- [knock at door]

01:07:30.937 --> 01:07:31.971
Wait, hold on.

01:07:32.105 --> 01:07:35.408
Oh, God. I gotta go.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.643
- Door?
- I told him.

01:07:39.078 --> 01:07:42.149
Where have you been?
Put it in the freezer. Let's go!

01:07:43.783 --> 01:07:45.685
- Where's this fish guy?
- Relax.

01:07:45.819 --> 01:07:49.355
Relax? I may be the first guy to get whacked
for not havin' enough fish at a party.

01:07:49.489 --> 01:07:51.690
- You know that, right?
- Everything will be fine.

01:07:51.825 --> 01:07:53.593
- I hope so. You, any more ice?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:53.727 --> 01:07:55.562
Go get it.
I gotta call Frankie.

01:08:06.372 --> 01:08:08.841
[yawns]

01:08:32.363 --> 01:08:34.701
- [women chattering]
- Miss Jo!

01:08:34.834 --> 01:08:38.037
Oh, God. Thank God.
Joe, fish guy!

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.709
- What took you so long?
- I'm sorry. You look beautiful.

01:08:42.841 --> 01:08:44.911
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:08:45.044 --> 01:08:47.680
- Where the fuck have you been? Are you crazy?
- I told you...

01:08:47.813 --> 01:08:49.215
Put it down.
Put it down.

01:09:07.033 --> 01:09:10.737
[chief over radio] <i>Croswell,
what's your status?</i>

01:09:10.871 --> 01:09:13.974
- Just waiting, sir.
- <i>Waiting? For what?</i>

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.578
- For people to arrive.
- <i>How many so far?</i>

01:09:19.979 --> 01:09:22.549
- No one, sir.
- <i>You'd better be right about this,</i>

01:09:22.683 --> 01:09:24.718
<i>or else it's your badge!</i>

01:09:27.386 --> 01:09:28.854

[sucks teeth, whistles]

01:10:46.165 --> 01:10:48.568

- Hey, Ed. What's up?

01:10:48.701 --> 01:10:50.203
- Where have you been?
- I'm at the motel.

01:10:50.336 --> 01:10:52.673

- Nope.

01:10:52.805 --> 01:10:55.040
Well, get your tail up here
as soon as you can!

01:10:55.175 --> 01:10:56.810

All right, ladies. Show time.
Let's go. Come here, Stephanie...

01:11:52.831 --> 01:11:55.267
[overlapping chatter]

01:12:00.974 --> 01:12:02.476
Hey, how you doin'?
Good to see you.

01:12:02.608 --> 01:12:04.243
Hey, how are ya?
Good to see you.

01:12:04.377 --> 01:12:06.812
- Frankie, what's up?
- How you doin', Joe?

01:12:06.946 --> 01:12:08.515
Good, good, good.
Carmine.

01:12:08.648 --> 01:12:11.250
- What do you need? You all right?
- How are you? Good to see you.

01:12:11.384 --> 01:12:13.118
You guys know each other, right?
Frankie, Mario.

01:12:13.252 --> 01:12:14.653

[vehicle approaches]

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:33.339
- Shh! The door!
- [whispers] Sorry.

01:12:33.973 --> 01:12:35.942
What?
What's goin' down, Ed?

01:12:36.075 --> 01:12:39.077
Did you not see Carmine
Galante's car back at the motel?

01:12:39.211 --> 01:12:41.281
Um, no.

01:12:43.248 --> 01:12:45.452
Somethin's goin' down.
I know it.

01:12:52.692 --> 01:12:55.062
Lieutenant, you there?

01:12:55.194 --> 01:12:56.562
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:12:56.696 --> 01:12:58.931
It's time to call in
reinforcements.

01:12:59.064 --> 01:13:01.067
<i>Why? What's goin' on
up there?</i>

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.836
The guests have just
started to arrive.

01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:05.572
<i>What are they doing?</i>

01:13:05.706 --> 01:13:08.175
Not sure, but there are
more on the way.

01:13:08.308 --> 01:13:11.577
<i>The call went out already.
Stand by and keep me posted.</i>

01:13:11.711 --> 01:13:13.145
10-4.

01:13:13.278 --> 01:13:16.382
- What's the plan, Ed?
- We're waitin' for reinforcements.

01:13:16.515 --> 01:13:18.550
- Reinforcements?
- Yeah.

01:13:18.684 --> 01:13:20.253
Lane's callin' in the FBI.

01:13:20.385 --> 01:13:22.120
Wait, you're tellin' me
we're raidin' the place?

01:13:22.255 --> 01:13:25.658
No, just a friendly visit
from the New York State Police.

01:13:25.791 --> 01:13:27.326
[chuckles]

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.596
What do you think
they're doin' in there, Ed?

01:13:30.729 --> 01:13:34.232
- I'm not sure, but they're definitely up to no good.
- Right.

01:13:34.367 --> 01:13:36.669
- Grab my notepad.
- Ed, I gotta tell you somethin'.

01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:38.438
What?

01:13:38.571 --> 01:13:41.475
I lied to you. I fell asleep in
the cruiser. I didn't see a thing.

01:13:42.274 --> 01:13:44.044
I kinda figured.

01:13:46.513 --> 01:13:49.381
Thanks, Ed. That's why
you're a good cop.

01:13:49.515 --> 01:13:51.616
Come on, Mama, take this out.
Let's go!

01:13:51.751 --> 01:13:54.954
Let's go, ladies, let's go!
I need more people to serve! Come on!

01:13:55.086 --> 01:13:57.389
Ang, go.
Take this out!

01:13:57.523 --> 01:14:00.827
- [laughing]
- They taste better than rats, I'll tell ya that shit.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.062
- [Jo] Joe?
- What?

01:14:03.196 --> 01:14:04.864
Can you come
over here, please?

01:14:04.997 --> 01:14:07.099
Yeah, I'm comin'.
[mouths words]

01:14:07.233 --> 01:14:09.068
You guys need anything,
you let me know, all right?

01:14:09.202 --> 01:14:11.137
Have some drinks.
The big guy will be here in a little bit.

01:14:11.269 --> 01:14:13.873
- Thank you, Joe.
- All right. Stop smokin'. No smokin'.

01:14:14.006 --> 01:14:16.142
- [Vince] Go.
- Three, five, eight.

01:14:16.274 --> 01:14:18.111
- Three-er, fiver, eighter.
- One.

01:14:18.243 --> 01:14:20.078
- One-er.
- Delta, Nancy.

01:14:20.212 --> 01:14:22.114
Delta.

01:14:22.248 --> 01:14:24.718
[chuckles] I wrote Delta, Nancy.
I just...

01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:28.354
It's just a D and an N.
Ed, I'm so excited. We got 'em!

01:14:28.487 --> 01:14:29.988
It's not over yet though.

01:14:30.122 --> 01:14:33.759
[rock 'n' roll music plays]

01:14:33.893 --> 01:14:36.862
- Gentlemen, please come in.
- Joey Gallo.

01:14:36.996 --> 01:14:38.697
- Welcome to our home.
- It's beautiful.

01:14:38.831 --> 01:14:40.400
Thank you.
Right in there.

01:14:40.532 --> 01:14:43.303
Please help yourself.
Food, beverages, anything you might need.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:50.977
You guys want a drink? You wanna eat
somethin'? We got a bunch of food.

01:14:51.109 --> 01:14:53.078
- Yeah.
- All right. I'll make sure I take care of you.

01:14:53.212 --> 01:14:55.348
Come here. I wanna
talk to you a second.

01:14:55.482 --> 01:14:57.517
[whispering, indistinct]

01:15:02.488 --> 01:15:05.157
Good job, what you guys did back there.
Truly amazing.

01:15:05.291 --> 01:15:08.427
I tell ya, this kid,
he don't miss.

01:15:09.428 --> 01:15:12.265
That's what they say.
Glad to be of service.

01:15:14.466 --> 01:15:16.102
Oh, here we go.

01:15:18.037 --> 01:15:19.439
- Hey, Bill.
- Guys.

01:15:19.572 --> 01:15:21.340
- Steve.
- Good to see you, Bill. How are you? Hey, Steve.

01:15:21.474 --> 01:15:23.476
- Thanks for comin' out.
- Yeah, sure thing.

01:15:23.609 --> 01:15:26.880
So I think we need to set up a roadblock
about a quarter mile down the road.

01:15:27.013 --> 01:15:29.047
- A roadblock? For what?
- There is only one road

01:15:29.181 --> 01:15:31.917
that leads in
and out of this town.

01:15:32.051 --> 01:15:33.385
We're gonna create
a bottleneck for 'em.

01:15:33.519 --> 01:15:36.888
Once they get settled here,
as they start to leave,

01:15:37.023 --> 01:15:39.192
we'll herd 'em like cattle
right into the pen.

01:15:39.325 --> 01:15:42.194
Buy some time before
the feds show up.

01:15:42.328 --> 01:15:44.697
- Wait, the-the feds?
- [Vince] Yeah, Lane called in the feds.

01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:46.733
It's really happening.

01:15:46.866 --> 01:15:49.602
[excited chattering]

01:15:49.736 --> 01:15:53.105
- Out of my kitchen!
- I got it, I got it, I...

01:15:56.742 --> 01:15:59.879
- Joe, we're starvin' over here!
- Five more minutes, the guy will be here.

01:16:00.011 --> 01:16:02.614
- Put some steaks on the grill, Come on!
- Stop bustin' my fuckin' balls!

01:16:02.747 --> 01:16:06.184
- Let's get a drink.
- I'll take you to the kitchen. You eat my wife's food.

01:16:06.318 --> 01:16:08.621
- [Carmine] Joe, steaks.
- What are you doin'?

01:16:08.755 --> 01:16:10.991
Come on, guys,
I'll take you to the kitchen.

01:16:12.323 --> 01:16:15.094
Don't tell me
this is the cavalry.

01:16:18.063 --> 01:16:19.732
- Sergeant Croswell?
- Yeah?

01:16:19.866 --> 01:16:23.136
Major Ruston. This is Agent Brown.
We're with ATU.

01:16:24.336 --> 01:16:26.739
- ATU?
- Alcohol and Tax Unit.

01:16:26.872 --> 01:16:28.607
Who called
the Department of Treasury?

01:16:28.741 --> 01:16:32.444
- Apparently, you did.
- No. There must be a mistake.

01:16:32.578 --> 01:16:34.013
Who were you expecting?

01:16:34.145 --> 01:16:35.813
Well, I don't know.
Maybe the FBI?

01:16:35.947 --> 01:16:37.482
The FBI?

01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:39.785
Why would the FBI
have any interest

01:16:39.919 --> 01:16:42.288
in a small family gathering
out in the middle of nowhere?

01:16:42.421 --> 01:16:45.890
- Who the heck is this guy?
- A family gathering?

01:16:46.024 --> 01:16:49.528
Would you guys care to elaborate
what exactly is going on here?

01:16:49.662 --> 01:16:53.166
Are you two blind?
Do you not see those cars right there?

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.636
Yeah, we do.
They look great.

01:16:58.737 --> 01:17:00.405
So what?

01:17:00.538 --> 01:17:03.843
Inside that house is the top
brass of the American Mafia.

01:17:03.977 --> 01:17:05.612
And this is all you got?

01:17:14.287 --> 01:17:16.957
Good to see you.
Thank you so much. Hey, guys!

01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:20.459
I wanna make a little
speech, all right?

01:17:20.593 --> 01:17:21.694
I just got a call.

01:17:21.827 --> 01:17:24.196
The man himself will
be here in ten minutes.

01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:26.832
In the meantime, have some
food, have some drinks.

01:17:26.965 --> 01:17:28.867
- You did good, Joe.
- Thank you.

01:17:29.001 --> 01:17:30.535
- All right, <i>salute!</i>
- [all] <i>Salute.</i>

01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:34.073
- All right, fellas, come on. Gather around.
- Yeah?

01:17:34.206 --> 01:17:37.377
Let's set up that roadblock
on McFall Street Road.

01:17:53.058 --> 01:17:55.595
- What's this?
- Good luck, guys.

01:18:01.733 --> 01:18:04.370
- You see this? See this car?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:12.178 --> 01:18:14.714
- It's him.
- [Vince] Who's him?

01:18:14.848 --> 01:18:17.183
- Vito Genovese.
- He's here?

01:18:17.315 --> 01:18:20.352
Yeah, he's here.
Take a look.

01:18:20.486 --> 01:18:23.122
Maybe you've seen him
on a poster or two.

01:18:25.791 --> 01:18:29.796
- Jesus Christ.
- Now maybe you can get some of your boys on the horn.

01:18:35.201 --> 01:18:36.569
Sergeant, come in.

01:18:36.702 --> 01:18:39.605
- <i>I'm here.</i>
- Vito Genovese is here.

01:18:41.407 --> 01:18:43.443
Oh shit. Excuse me.

01:18:46.345 --> 01:18:48.348
Don Vitone,
good to see you.

01:18:49.247 --> 01:18:50.315
- He's here.
- He's here?

01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:51.884
- Just walked in.
- Come on. Seriously?

01:18:52.017 --> 01:18:53.085
- Mm-hmm.
- Who's he with?

01:18:53.219 --> 01:18:54.654
- Two guys.
- All right, I love you.

01:18:54.787 --> 01:18:56.289
Don Vito.

01:19:00.326 --> 01:19:03.028
Don Vito, what a pleasure
to have you in my home.

01:19:03.162 --> 01:19:06.298
You got a beautiful place here, Joe.
Thank you for having us.

01:19:06.431 --> 01:19:08.835
Thank you so much.
This is my beautiful wife, Josephine.

01:19:08.968 --> 01:19:10.502
- Hi.
- Ah. Lovely to meet you.

01:19:10.635 --> 01:19:14.105
- Nice to meet you.
- Here, I got a little somethin' for you.

01:19:14.239 --> 01:19:15.707
- Oh.
- This is for you.

01:19:15.841 --> 01:19:17.308
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:19:17.443 --> 01:19:19.312
And, Joe,
I give you my hand,

01:19:19.444 --> 01:19:21.145
in friendship,
whenever you need.

01:19:21.279 --> 01:19:23.916
What an honor. Thank you so much.
We have a special room ready for you.

01:19:24.049 --> 01:19:27.453
All right, Bill. I need you to head down
that road about two and a half miles.

01:19:27.586 --> 01:19:30.255
If there's not a roadblock
already, establish one.

01:19:30.389 --> 01:19:32.091
- You got it, boss.
- I want you to cover the perimeter.

01:19:32.224 --> 01:19:35.126
- The back of the woods. Take Steve with you, okay?
- You got it, Ed.

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.761
- Make sure no one gets out.
- All right.

01:19:36.895 --> 01:19:39.866
You two stay with me.
I'm gonna see if we got some backup.

01:19:39.998 --> 01:19:42.167
- Hey.
- Thank you so much.

01:19:42.301 --> 01:19:44.670
[Jo] Go on in.
Thank you.

01:19:47.974 --> 01:19:50.943
I appreciate
that you're all here

01:19:51.076 --> 01:19:53.279
and everything
you've done for me.

01:19:53.412 --> 01:19:55.415
And I wanna
thank Joe again.

01:19:55.547 --> 01:19:58.684
I'm not gonna say much.
He's made this great feast, you know?

01:19:58.818 --> 01:20:00.620
- You got meat?
- Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah.

01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:02.889
I'll go get it.
Yeah, of course.

01:20:04.223 --> 01:20:07.560
Some, uh, mountains
have fallen down on us.

01:20:08.894 --> 01:20:12.532
Charlie will never step foot
on these shores again.

01:20:13.433 --> 01:20:15.935
Albert,
may he rest in peace.

01:20:16.068 --> 01:20:18.904
And our good friend
Frank Costello,

01:20:19.037 --> 01:20:20.873
he has decided to retire.

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:23.375
Now we have a void.

01:20:23.509 --> 01:20:25.545
I'm gonna have to take
a closer look.

01:20:25.678 --> 01:20:28.279
Write down the rest
of these license plates.

01:20:28.413 --> 01:20:30.582
Why don't you check
on that backup?

01:20:30.716 --> 01:20:32.550
Roger that.

01:20:32.684 --> 01:20:36.388
Men stumble on stones,
not mountains.

01:20:38.523 --> 01:20:41.693
How many of you around here
know their way around stones,

01:20:41.827 --> 01:20:44.764
to keep everybody earning,
and I mean everybody?

01:20:46.831 --> 01:20:50.369
Who knows the old ways?
The La Cosa Nostra?

01:21:00.078 --> 01:21:01.781
Joseph!

01:21:01.913 --> 01:21:02.948
- Joe!
- [Joe] What?

01:21:03.081 --> 01:21:04.115
- Come here.
- What?

01:21:04.248 --> 01:21:05.718
Come here!

01:21:06.685 --> 01:21:07.754
Look!

01:21:11.157 --> 01:21:12.692
Oh, God.

01:21:16.129 --> 01:21:18.765
- I'll be right back. Don't say anything.
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:22.835 --> 01:21:25.270
[speaking Italian]

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.209
I want you to make sure that all
the bosses and all the captains,

01:21:30.341 --> 01:21:32.978
all the families...

01:21:33.111 --> 01:21:34.880
I want their loyalty.

01:21:35.013 --> 01:21:36.849
I want their support.

01:21:38.984 --> 01:21:40.752
<i>Capo dei capi.</i>

01:21:40.885 --> 01:21:43.455
- Mm.
- [footsteps]

01:21:43.589 --> 01:21:46.326
- What is it?
- There's police outside.

01:21:48.694 --> 01:21:50.495
Boss.

01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:52.732
It'd be best
for us to go.

01:21:52.864 --> 01:21:54.533
Everybody scram!

01:21:55.901 --> 01:21:58.571
[panicked chattering]

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.509
[horn honks]

01:22:08.546 --> 01:22:10.817
[horns honking]

01:22:22.228 --> 01:22:24.464
[honking continues]

01:22:28.567 --> 01:22:31.304
[horse whinnies]

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.442
We got a bunch of guys
headin' into the woods!

01:22:37.576 --> 01:22:39.412
Circle around
and grab 'em.

01:22:49.988 --> 01:22:51.757
[grunts]

01:23:04.569 --> 01:23:06.438
[panting]
Son of a bitch.

01:23:06.572 --> 01:23:08.808
Frankie, gimme a hand
here, will ya?

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:12.510
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Mario.
I can't run anymore.

01:23:12.644 --> 01:23:15.714
What the fuck? Come on!
Come on, Frankie!

01:23:34.565 --> 01:23:37.103
[phone ringing]

01:23:43.575 --> 01:23:45.544
[ringing continues]

01:23:45.678 --> 01:23:48.212
It's okay.
I got it, Ed.

01:23:48.346 --> 01:23:52.017
- Hello?
- [woman] <i>Good morning. Is Mr. Croswell available?</i>

01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:55.654
Uh, yes. Hold on one second.
Ed, it's for you.

01:23:57.288 --> 01:23:58.825
Thank you.

01:24:00.593 --> 01:24:02.461
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. Croswell?</i>

01:24:02.594 --> 01:24:04.697
- Speaking.
- <i>This is the White House.</i>

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:07.500
<i>Are you available to speak
with the president?</i>

01:24:07.632 --> 01:24:09.368
Yeah, of course.

01:24:09.501 --> 01:24:12.237
<i>Mr. Croswell, we have
the president on the line.</i>

01:24:13.171 --> 01:24:14.806
[President Eisenhower]
<i>Sergeant Ed Croswell?</i>

01:24:14.939 --> 01:24:17.609
- Yes, Mr. President.
- <i>I just wanted to give you a call</i>

01:24:17.742 --> 01:24:20.611
<i>and personally congratulate you
for all your hard work.</i>

01:24:20.746 --> 01:24:23.382
<i>I didn't want you to think
that it's gone unnoticed.</i>

01:24:23.514 --> 01:24:24.983
Thank you, sir.

01:24:25.117 --> 01:24:27.053
<i>Now, I know those
convictions didn't stick,</i>

01:24:27.185 --> 01:24:29.854
<i>but I wanted you to hear this
from me first.</i>

01:24:29.988 --> 01:24:32.223
<i>I've instructed Director Hoover
to publicly denounce</i>

01:24:32.358 --> 01:24:35.761
<i>this organized crime syndicate

01:24:35.894 --> 01:24:38.696
<i>and it's all thanks to you

- Why, thank you, sir.
- <i>Keep up the good work, son.</i>

01:24:43.102 --> 01:24:44.804
Will do.

01:24:48.573 --> 01:24:50.609
Ed, is everything okay?

01:24:52.278 --> 01:24:53.679
Yeah.
