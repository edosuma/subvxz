Tentacles in what must be either

11:10.740 --> 11:13.042
a bizarre piece
of performance art

11:13.042 --> 11:14.877
or the saddest display
of loneliness

11:14.877 --> 11:17.547
it has ever been
my displeasure to report.

11:17.547 --> 11:20.983
One is inclined to suspect
the second thing I said.

11:20.983 --> 11:23.953
The thing about sadness.

11:24.987 --> 11:28.324
- You'll always be my plus one.

11:28.324 --> 11:30.059
- Aww.

11:35.420 --> 11:38.623
[upbeat ukulele music]

11:45.163 --> 11:47.632
- [panting]

11:53.405 --> 11:55.440
- All right, hold on a second,
you freeloader.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.441
What are you doing here?

11:56.441 --> 11:58.010
- I'm here for lunch.

11:58.010 --> 12:00.579
- Did you bring money
this time?

12:00.579 --> 12:01.747
- Yes.

12:01.747 --> 12:04.449
- [panting and barking]

12:04.449 --> 12:07.352
Let me see that.
[sniffs]

12:13.425 --> 12:16.328
All right, tastes real.
Now get in line.

12:16.328 --> 12:20.265
- Yes, sir.

12:20.265 --> 12:23.101
- Hey, how's that new Executive
Treatment sandwich treating you?

12:23.101 --> 12:26.138
'Cause it's hitting all the
quadrants of my hunger markets.

12:26.138 --> 12:28.540
- Mmm, quadrants.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.042
- You know, it reminds me
of something I was saying

12:30.042 --> 12:31.677
about business the other day.

12:31.677 --> 12:34.746
- The satisfaction earnings of
the fourth quarter of my lunch

12:34.746 --> 12:36.381
are off the charts.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.549
[laughter]

12:37.549 --> 12:40.052
- And I love the way
it tastes.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.320
- And business, my friend,

12:41.320 --> 12:42.921
is the business
that I'm talking about.

12:42.921 --> 12:46.058
- Well, one can't have business
without business, right?

12:46.058 --> 12:49.027
- Interesting point, Marv.
How's your sandwich?

12:49.027 --> 12:50.629
- Absolutely spectacular.

12:50.629 --> 12:52.431
This new menu item is
a business plan

12:52.431 --> 12:54.933
I can really get behind.

12:54.933 --> 12:57.903
- I tell you, this is one
dynamic little sandwich.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.005
- With levels of proactiveness
that are off the charts,

13:00.005 --> 13:01.440
business-wise.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.241
- It really appeals
to my demographic.

13:03.241 --> 13:04.876
- Well, you are an executive

13:04.876 --> 13:06.445
in the fast-paced
world of business.

13:06.445 --> 13:08.413
- Ha ha!
That's for sure.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.082
- These guys talk funny words.

13:10.082 --> 13:13.452
- Oh, yeah, they're a riot.
What can I get you?

13:13.452 --> 13:16.588
- I guess I'll have one
of these business sandwiches

13:16.588 --> 13:18.290
everybody's talking about.

13:18.290 --> 13:22.060
- Ah, the Executive Treatment.
- Is that what you call it?

13:22.060 --> 13:25.063
- Well, that's what
Mr. Krabs makes me call it.

13:25.063 --> 13:28.000
It's really just a Krabby Patty
that costs more,

13:28.000 --> 13:32.070
and SpongeBob wears a different
tie when he makes it.

13:32.070 --> 13:34.172
- Oh, wow.
I'll take seven.

13:34.172 --> 13:35.774
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

13:35.774 --> 13:39.411
The executive treatment is
available to executives only.

13:39.411 --> 13:40.979
I'm not sorry.

13:40.979 --> 13:44.716
- But I've never wanted anything
so much in my whole life

13:44.716 --> 13:47.185
since this morning
when I wanted a doughnut

13:47.185 --> 13:48.754
and I ate that doughnut

13:48.754 --> 13:52.457
and it was great.

13:52.457 --> 13:55.560
That doughnut is gone.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.362
The doughnut is gone!

13:57.362 --> 14:01.700
- First of all, a lot of that
doughnut is still on your face.

14:03.101 --> 14:06.438
- Now, where's
my Executive Treatment?

14:06.438 --> 14:09.241
- I told you,
it's for executives only.

14:09.241 --> 14:12.577
And you aren't even dressed
like an executive.

14:12.577 --> 14:14.212
I could, of course, sell you

14:14.212 --> 14:18.850
an official Krusty Krab
business tie for only $10.

14:18.850 --> 14:21.386
- Will the tie let me order
the Executive Treatment?

14:21.386 --> 14:25.991
- Not on its own, no, but you
could Krabby-size the tie

14:25.991 --> 14:28.327
and get a set
of business glasses

14:28.327 --> 14:30.228
for an additional $10.

14:30.228 --> 14:33.298
- Oh, ho ho,
I'd be stupid not to.

14:33.298 --> 14:35.233
- Well, you're half right.

14:35.233 --> 14:36.702
- Here's your 20 bucks.

14:36.702 --> 14:38.603
- Here's your glasses.
- Thanks.

14:38.603 --> 14:43.041
I'll take one Executive
Treatment, my good man.

14:43.041 --> 14:46.211
- Here's your
Executive Treatment.

14:46.211 --> 14:47.946
- Here you go.

14:47.946 --> 14:49.414
- Oh, man.

14:49.414 --> 14:51.817
That looks
executively delicious.

14:51.817 --> 14:53.285
- Carl, what are you doing
standing around

14:53.285 --> 14:54.987
at a time like this?

14:54.987 --> 14:56.855
We're gonna be late for
the big brainstorming meeting.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.591
all: Business. Business.
Business. Business.

14:59.591 --> 15:02.260
- Save my sandwich
for me, Squidward!

15:02.260 --> 15:04.196
Squidward!

15:04.196 --> 15:06.598
- Ah, I'll save it all right.

15:06.598 --> 15:09.334
I'll just put it here
in the circular file.

15:09.334 --> 15:11.937
[giggles]

15:11.937 --> 15:13.338
- What are you doing
throwing away

15:13.338 --> 15:15.841
a perfectly sellable sandwich?

15:15.841 --> 15:19.478
all: Business.
Business. Business.

15:19.478 --> 15:22.314
- No!
Oh, no!

15:22.314 --> 15:23.815
all: Business.
Business. Business.

15:23.815 --> 15:26.184
Business, business, business,
business, business.

15:26.184 --> 15:27.786
- [straining]

15:27.786 --> 15:31.723
all: Business, business,
business, business.

15:31.723 --> 15:34.426
- No!

15:34.426 --> 15:37.429
[soft jazz music]

15:42.534 --> 15:44.269
[bell dings]
No!

15:44.269 --> 15:48.006
all: Business. Business.

15:48.006 --> 15:50.375
- Not 4B!

15:50.375 --> 15:53.245
No!

15:53.245 --> 15:55.847
- Wow, you're very upset
about Conference Room 4B.

15:55.847 --> 15:58.183
And I can't say I blame you,

15:58.183 --> 15:59.651
because Conference Room 4B

15:59.651 --> 16:01.553
is the most terrifying
conference room

16:01.553 --> 16:03.021
in the whole building.

16:03.021 --> 16:05.190
More people have been
fired in here

16:05.190 --> 16:07.859
than all the other
conference rooms combined.

16:07.859 --> 16:09.194
- [screams]

16:09.194 --> 16:11.163
- Save it for the big
brainstorming meeting.

16:11.163 --> 16:14.132
Right here is where all
the biggest business decisions

16:14.132 --> 16:15.801
in the business are made.

16:15.801 --> 16:18.904
Why, if an imposter were
to be caught in here? Mm.

16:18.904 --> 16:21.707
- He'd be given a sandwich
and sent on his way?

16:21.707 --> 16:24.576
- No. He'd be convicted
as a corporate spy

16:24.576 --> 16:27.212
and sent to jail forever
and ever and ever.

16:27.212 --> 16:28.580
Hey, where you going?

16:28.580 --> 16:30.582
- I think I forgot to...

16:30.582 --> 16:32.751
water my manatee.
I'll just--

16:32.751 --> 16:36.688
- Gentlemen.
Ladies.

16:36.688 --> 16:38.056
- Where am I?

16:38.056 --> 16:39.191
- Exactly.

16:39.191 --> 16:40.525
I like you, young man.

16:40.525 --> 16:42.861
Everybody scoot down
so he can sit next to me

16:42.861 --> 16:44.196
and I won't intimidate him
at all

16:44.196 --> 16:46.298
by my terrifying largeness
and proximity.

16:46.298 --> 16:49.334
As this junior executive
so eloquently put it,

16:49.334 --> 16:51.136
where exactly are we?

16:51.136 --> 16:53.071
- Sir, if you take
a look at this,

16:53.071 --> 16:55.007
I believe you'll agree that
we're perfectly positioned

16:55.007 --> 16:56.541
for our marketing
to be number one

16:56.541 --> 16:57.709
across the business sector.

16:57.709 --> 16:59.644
all: Business.
Business. Business.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.812
- What I need is
a straight answer,

17:00.812 --> 17:02.914
not a bunch
of meaningless charts.

17:02.914 --> 17:04.583
What do you give
a disappointed stockholder

17:04.583 --> 17:06.651
to make him feel better?

17:06.651 --> 17:09.186
- A sandwich?

17:10.656 --> 17:12.790
[laughter]

17:12.790 --> 17:15.560
- Get a load of this guy!
A sandwich.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.695
- This guy has sandwiches
on the brain.

17:17.695 --> 17:19.931
- No, I don't.

17:19.931 --> 17:22.567
- That's just about
the silliest piece of idea.

17:22.567 --> 17:23.969
- All right, hold it.

17:23.969 --> 17:25.704
Now all of you just
hold it right there.

17:25.704 --> 17:28.907
It's easy to laugh and josh
and heap a man with scorn

17:28.907 --> 17:30.575
when you hear an idea
that stands out

17:30.575 --> 17:33.178
because it's so unusual.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.813
So everybody just stop
and think for a minute

17:34.813 --> 17:37.616
about what your colleague here
is really trying to say.

17:37.616 --> 17:39.751
Because I want to be the one
to tell him,

17:39.751 --> 17:41.820
"That's the silliest thing
I ever heard."

17:41.820 --> 17:44.423
- What if I have
a meaningless chart?

17:44.423 --> 17:48.060
- Yes. Maybe I was
too hasty about that.

17:48.060 --> 17:49.995
- Oh, good.

17:53.265 --> 17:54.599
- Well, you've definitely
given new meaning

17:54.599 --> 17:56.535
to the word "meaningless."

17:56.535 --> 17:57.869
- Oh, wait.

17:59.338 --> 18:02.140
[chuckles]

18:02.140 --> 18:06.545
And here's a little house with
smoke coming out of the chimney.

18:06.545 --> 18:07.646
See what I mean?

18:07.646 --> 18:09.381
- [growls]

18:09.381 --> 18:11.550
- I guess he liked my chart.
He's smiling.

18:11.550 --> 18:13.552
- He smiles like that
when he's really angry.

18:13.552 --> 18:17.322
[all muttering in agreement]
- He does, does it every time.

18:17.322 --> 18:20.625
- Do you slap your palms down
on the table like that, too?

18:20.625 --> 18:24.262
- Yes.
- Oh.

18:24.262 --> 18:27.265
- I don't know who you are, but
you better not be an imposter.

18:27.265 --> 18:28.600
You know what happens
to imposters

18:28.600 --> 18:30.268
in Conference Room 4B?

18:30.268 --> 18:32.871
- Well, uh, let's see.
Don't tell me.

18:32.871 --> 18:35.841
I know it's not sandwiches.

18:35.841 --> 18:39.144
They don't get sandwiches.
Do they?

18:42.681 --> 18:45.684
- Mister, this is
the last straw.

18:45.684 --> 18:47.419
all: Aww.

18:47.419 --> 18:50.589
- I'm going to give you just 18
more chances to prove yourself.

18:50.589 --> 18:53.058
narrator: Montage.

18:53.058 --> 18:55.861
- [mumbling]

18:58.163 --> 19:00.032
- [growls]

19:00.032 --> 19:00.999
[all gasp]

19:00.999 --> 19:02.734
- Jenkins?
- Yes, sir.

19:02.734 --> 19:03.735
- Moustache.

19:03.735 --> 19:06.304
- Ooh, here you are, sir.

19:31.563 --> 19:32.831
[timer dings]

19:36.668 --> 19:39.137
- [whistles]

19:58.824 --> 20:02.728
[drum roll]

20:13.405 --> 20:15.307
And so in conclusion,

20:15.307 --> 20:18.877
I would like to submit
my official report.

20:25.217 --> 20:28.186
- You know, kid, we need
somebody like you around here.

20:28.186 --> 20:30.422
- You do?
- For me to fire.

20:30.422 --> 20:32.991
- Oh, yeah?
Well...

20:32.991 --> 20:36.728
I've got
a surprise for you.

20:36.728 --> 20:38.363
[all gasping]
- Where'd he go?

20:38.363 --> 20:39.765
- You can't fire me.

20:39.765 --> 20:42.401
I'm not an executive at all.

20:42.401 --> 20:46.171
I'm just a guy
who happens to like sandwiches.

20:46.171 --> 20:47.873
So go ahead.

20:47.873 --> 20:52.210
Send me away forever as
a corporate spy if you want to,

20:52.210 --> 20:56.081
but not before I've had my say.

20:58.550 --> 21:01.887
[cell door clanks shut]

21:01.887 --> 21:04.389
[doors shut]

21:04.389 --> 21:05.824
- You have a visitor.

21:09.661 --> 21:10.929
- Who is it?

21:10.929 --> 21:13.131
- Hello, Patrick.
- Hi, SpongeBob.

21:13.131 --> 21:14.633
- Hey, I heard
you're in charge of

21:14.633 --> 21:17.202
the laundry room on Thursdays.
That's nice.

21:17.202 --> 21:18.236
- Yeah.

21:18.236 --> 21:21.340
Yeah, it's pretty nice, I guess.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.775
- You know what that makes you?
- Uh-uh.

21:23.775 --> 21:25.677
- An executive!

21:25.677 --> 21:27.879
- Oh, wait!

21:27.879 --> 21:29.848
Is that what I think it is?

21:29.848 --> 21:32.451
- Uh-huh.
An Executive Treatment.

21:34.820 --> 21:37.322
- [chomping]

21:38.790 --> 21:41.226
Mmm.

21:42.394 --> 21:45.831
Eh.

21:45.831 --> 21:47.065
- [gasps]

21:47.065 --> 21:50.502
What happened
to prisoner 665321?

21:50.502 --> 21:54.806
[alarm blares]

21:54.806 --> 21:56.675
- Let's go home, SpongeBob.

21:56.675 --> 21:59.211
- Okay.
But who are you?

21:59.211 --> 22:00.879
- [laughs]

22:00.879 --> 22:03.615
[laughter]

22:03.615 --> 22:06.818
Who am I?

22:06.818 --> 22:10.022
[laughter]

22:10.022 --> 22:12.157
- No, seriously, who are you?
