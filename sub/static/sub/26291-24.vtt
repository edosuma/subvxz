03:42.265 --> 03:43.899
LSD.

get access to what's
in that brain of yours.

03:49.739 --> 03:52.908

03:57.914 --> 03:59.548
Very simple.

We pulled this off of a man

04:07.244 --> 04:09.059
I didn't send him.

04:09.083 --> 04:09.958

completely destroyed

04:09.959 --> 04:11.527

04:11.594 --> 04:15.364
your man survived just

04:16.766 --> 04:19.567
of Apollyon Intel that
Amelia Parsons collected

04:19.636 --> 04:22.705
is on this laptop, and...

04:45.695 --> 04:48.030
It's okay.

04:48.098 --> 04:49.932
Dwayne, you tell me
what I want to know,

04:49.999 --> 04:52.468
and you are more
than welcome to die.

04:56.940 --> 04:58.807
We know Pride's no longer
in South Ossetia,

04:58.875 --> 05:01.377
and neither is Avery Walker,
so where are they now?

Short answer:
we have no clue.

05:03.046 --> 05:04.090
PATTON:
I was able to piggyback

05:04.114 --> 05:05.447
on Apollyon's comm system

05:05.515 --> 05:07.149
for a hot minute,
but I got kicked off.

05:07.217 --> 05:08.828
Yeah, we've been trying
to reestablish the connection

05:08.852 --> 05:10.986
so we can monitor their chatter
for the last two days,

05:11.054 --> 05:12.164
but they've gone dark.
- Okay.

05:12.188 --> 05:14.123
Keep working.
What else we got?

05:14.190 --> 05:16.625
Well, Apollyon planted a
double agent in intelligence

05:16.693 --> 05:18.494
or law enforcement
community.

05:18.561 --> 05:21.663
Whoever it is was able to tip
Walker off about Isler's raid.

05:21.731 --> 05:23.709
Yeah. If we find the double
agent though, we might be able

05:23.733 --> 05:25.144
to leverage them
into leading us to Walker.

05:25.168 --> 05:26.402
We just got to do it quietly.

05:26.469 --> 05:28.737
Quietly is the problem.
After everything

05:28.805 --> 05:30.282
that's happened,
we're under a microscope now.

05:30.306 --> 05:32.674
I'd say more like
a floodlight.

05:32.742 --> 05:35.444
Special Agent Parker?
What is Homeland doing here?

We've got a real crap storm
on our hands.

05:37.013 --> 05:38.414
D.C. sent me in to clean it up.

05:38.481 --> 05:39.748
Well, Pride's our family.

05:39.816 --> 05:41.483

HANNAH: No.

05:51.561 --> 05:53.662

05:53.730 --> 05:54.963
Actually, you'll help <i>me.</i>

05:55.031 --> 05:56.632
I'm running a
joint investigation

05:56.699 --> 05:57.633

05:57.700 --> 05:59.301
NCIS is under my purview now.

05:59.369 --> 06:01.437

Avery Walker,

06:02.872 --> 06:04.540

06:04.607 --> 06:05.474
First thing we need

06:05.542 --> 06:07.109
is to see Raymond Isler's body.

06:09.612 --> 06:11.056
This is ridiculous.
If too many cooks spoil the broth,

06:11.080 --> 06:12.714
what do you think it
does to an autopsy?

06:12.782 --> 06:14.693
I hear you, but on the other
hand, we don't have a choice.

06:14.717 --> 06:17.653
- This is Parker's show now.
- This is <i>my</i> morgue.

06:17.720 --> 06:18.920
Don't leave that
there, please.

06:18.955 --> 06:20.355
You haven't performed
the autopsy.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.558
I'm waiting for the circus
to leave town.

06:22.625 --> 06:25.894
You can stand down.
FBI medical examiner

06:25.962 --> 06:28.330
will come in from D.C. tomorrow,
handle it personally.

06:28.398 --> 06:31.700
Can you explain to me how that
will help us get Dwayne back?

06:31.768 --> 06:34.169
(quietly): Just got
to stick to the plan.

06:37.140 --> 06:38.640
Hey.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.375
No, don't get up.

06:40.443 --> 06:44.179
I just want to, uh, show you
the results of your hard work.

06:44.247 --> 06:46.682
Raymond Isler is dead.

06:46.749 --> 06:49.184
So you need to
stop fighting.

06:49.252 --> 06:50.719
You need to cooperate.

06:50.787 --> 06:52.554
Nobody else needs to die.

06:54.991 --> 06:57.426
All right, my friend?

06:57.494 --> 06:59.495
We'll start again soon.

07:02.298 --> 07:05.267
Can't help but feel
responsible for all this.

07:06.736 --> 07:08.337
Raymond.

07:08.404 --> 07:10.339
His deal does sound
pretty good to me.

07:10.406 --> 07:12.107
But what do I know?

07:12.175 --> 07:14.276
I'm dead.

07:28.124 --> 07:30.192
Hold that.

07:46.442 --> 07:49.645
(gasps, groans)

07:50.947 --> 07:53.448

We're just glad you're not

08:22.036 --> 08:25.225
Well, next time you have a brilliant plan,
you should be the one who dies.

08:25.293 --> 08:26.560
HANNAH:
I'm pretty sure that

08:26.628 --> 08:29.129
we have convinced official
Washington that you're gone.

08:29.197 --> 08:30.364
<i>Pretty</i> sure?

08:30.431 --> 08:32.071
The plan was to draw out
the double agent,

08:32.133 --> 08:34.134
hope that he reached out
to Walker to inform him

08:34.202 --> 08:35.736
of your... demise.

08:35.803 --> 08:37.114
GREGORIO: Well, that's
exactly what happened.

08:37.138 --> 08:38.448
Patton intercepted
a remote message

08:38.472 --> 08:40.039
sent from near the morgue.

08:40.107 --> 08:41.684
- Photo of you on the table.
- So someone

08:41.708 --> 08:43.587
in the autopsy room yesterday
is definitely the mole

08:43.611 --> 08:45.712
or working with the mole.
- Yeah, the message came

08:45.780 --> 08:47.691
from a secure phone-- Patton's
trying to trace the signal,

08:47.715 --> 08:48.916
but it keeps bouncing around.

08:48.983 --> 08:51.084
What is Walker's endgame here?

08:51.152 --> 08:53.654
The Apollyon Intel
from Amelia Parsons' tattoo.

08:54.656 --> 08:57.057
- Pride has the last copy.
- Where?

08:57.125 --> 09:00.427
Well, I was hoping
that you might know.

09:00.495 --> 09:03.163
(door opens)

09:03.231 --> 09:06.433
Hey, what are you doing
here at 5:00 a.m.?

09:06.501 --> 09:09.069

I was gonna start the gumbo.

09:10.805 --> 09:13.040

09:24.619 --> 09:26.397

09:35.263 --> 09:39.032
Raymond Isler. Friend
of your brother's.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.078
Okay, we need to get back to work.
Track that signal.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.603
Keep looking
for the double agent,

09:42.670 --> 09:44.938
and keep DHS occupied.
- On it.

09:46.975 --> 09:49.576
Jimmy, there is a way that
you might be able to help.

09:49.644 --> 09:51.578
We need you to hide him.

09:52.847 --> 09:54.648
No one can know
that he's alive.

10:01.456 --> 10:02.923
There's something else.

10:02.991 --> 10:04.791
Would you have any idea

10:04.859 --> 10:06.326
might have hid
something important?

10:07.829 --> 10:09.396
JONES:
<i>Dwayne,</i>

10:09.464 --> 10:11.264
are you with me?

10:12.967 --> 10:16.103
First I'm gonna ask you
some simple baseline questions.

10:16.170 --> 10:18.772
Easy ones.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.174
"What is your name?"

10:21.242 --> 10:23.076
Dwayne Pride.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.678
Very good.

10:24.746 --> 10:26.647
"Place of birth?"

10:26.714 --> 10:29.082
New Orleans, Louisiana.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.617
There you go. See?

10:30.685 --> 10:32.285
Easy.

10:34.422 --> 10:36.356
"Mother's maiden name?"

10:37.925 --> 10:39.693
Cantrell.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.497
"What's your purpose in life?"

10:43.564 --> 10:45.198
My purpose?

10:45.266 --> 10:46.933
(sighs) Your greatest failure?

10:47.001 --> 10:48.935
- I...
- Your hopes, your dreams.

10:49.003 --> 10:50.537
Your secret crush.

10:50.605 --> 10:52.372
Y-You're going too f-fast.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.441
What's the worst lie
you've ever told?

10:54.509 --> 10:56.176
The hardest truth?

10:56.244 --> 10:58.011
- Please.
- Dwayne.

10:58.079 --> 10:59.312
Pay attention.

11:00.915 --> 11:02.215
Have you ever faced death?

11:03.718 --> 11:04.985
Were you tempted?

11:15.763 --> 11:19.299
I should probably explain to you
that you'll be seeing things.

11:19.367 --> 11:21.201
Don't fight it.

11:22.603 --> 11:24.137
Name of your high school.

11:26.697 --> 11:27.350
God!

11:27.374 --> 11:29.374
Hey, man, y'all can't
sneak up on us like that.

11:29.377 --> 11:31.011
No sneaking,
we just walked in.

11:31.079 --> 11:32.856
Yeah, you and every other
federal agent in here.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.558
When this is done, we got
to invest in some locks.

11:34.582 --> 11:35.982
Provided we still have jobs.

11:36.050 --> 11:37.795
Any luck tracing where
the photo of Isler went?

11:37.819 --> 11:39.586
Plenty. Just not the right kind.

11:39.654 --> 11:41.565
Yeah. Patton was able to
piggyback onto the signal,

11:41.589 --> 11:43.067
but every time we get close
to the origin point,

11:43.091 --> 11:45.158
we lose contact.
- Some kind of firewall?

11:45.226 --> 11:46.727
It's not like
a security measure,

11:46.794 --> 11:48.562
it's more like
the origin point disappears.

11:48.629 --> 11:50.140
Yeah, then it reappears
somewhere else and we have

11:50.164 --> 11:51.681
to start all over again.
We have no idea how the signal

11:51.682 --> 11:52.547
keeps bouncing around.

11:52.571 --> 11:54.134
So in other words,
you need more time.

11:54.135 --> 11:55.435
More time for what?

11:57.004 --> 11:59.372
Don't all answer at once.

11:59.440 --> 12:03.110
Uh, we're gathering
Intel on Apollyon.

12:03.177 --> 12:05.545
I can smell B.S.
when it's being shoveled.

12:05.613 --> 12:07.414
I know what's going on.

12:07.482 --> 12:09.850
You do?

12:09.917 --> 12:12.129
You're feeling territorial, but
there's no time for that now.

12:12.153 --> 12:13.386
You have a mess on your hands.

12:13.454 --> 12:15.555
Are you gonna help me
clean it up or not?

12:15.623 --> 12:17.134
Well, let me tell you
what I'm gonna do.

12:17.158 --> 12:19.169
You're gonna listen to
everything Special Agent Parker

12:19.193 --> 12:20.460
has to say and cooperate fully.

12:20.528 --> 12:22.429
Come on, move it. Now.

12:22.497 --> 12:24.731
Gregorio, with me.

12:30.371 --> 12:31.638
Were you serious
in there?

12:31.706 --> 12:33.073
We need to sell
this better

12:33.141 --> 12:34.708
if we want to get
Parker off our backs.

12:34.776 --> 12:36.209
Okay? I need you
to cover for me.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.711
I'm gonna head out.

12:37.779 --> 12:39.479
Where to, Special Agent Khoury?

12:39.547 --> 12:40.159
You're everywhere.

12:40.183 --> 12:41.515
I was just gonna pick up

12:41.516 --> 12:43.917
some lunch for you guys;
it's the least we can do.

12:45.620 --> 12:48.655
You want to know why D.C.
sent me to run this operation?

12:48.723 --> 12:52.459
A few years back, I was
investigating Avery Walker.

12:52.527 --> 12:55.328
No one knew Apollyon existed.

12:55.396 --> 12:57.164
I had him in my sights.

12:57.231 --> 13:00.767
Before we could make a move,
my entire team was taken out.

13:00.835 --> 13:03.937
There was a mole
feeding Walker information.

13:04.005 --> 13:06.640
Someone from law enforcement;
never found out who.

13:06.707 --> 13:11.344
So if there's anything
you're not telling me...

13:11.412 --> 13:14.648
now's the time.

13:14.715 --> 13:17.651
You know what we know.

13:19.554 --> 13:21.321
Okay. Good.

13:21.389 --> 13:22.756
Whatever you're getting
for lunch,

13:22.824 --> 13:24.124
I hope there's a protein bowl.

13:24.192 --> 13:26.426
I'm on a strict keto diet.

13:31.899 --> 13:33.700
He's ready.

13:33.768 --> 13:36.703
Anybody there?

13:39.273 --> 13:40.707
Hello?

13:40.775 --> 13:43.343
Anyone here?

13:43.411 --> 13:44.611
HANNAH:
We're out of options.

13:47.181 --> 13:51.017
Pride's been taken. There is no
good way to get him out alive.

13:51.085 --> 13:52.552
Yeah, but this plan is crazy.

13:52.620 --> 13:54.988
Gotta roll the dice.

13:57.191 --> 13:58.959
Seriously. Gotta roll the dice.

14:07.268 --> 14:09.202
Oh. Snake eyes.

14:09.270 --> 14:11.404
We're gonna have to pull
a Hail Mary card.

14:11.472 --> 14:12.472
(Patton exhales)

14:12.540 --> 14:14.007
GREGORIO:
All right.

14:16.811 --> 14:19.079
I get shot by snipers.

14:20.214 --> 14:21.848
Incinerated by a car bomb.

14:22.917 --> 14:24.384
Throat slashed. Ear to ear.

14:24.452 --> 14:26.486
Captured, tortured,
beaten to death.

14:26.554 --> 14:29.356
Still, it's our best chance.
Let's go.

14:29.423 --> 14:30.724
- All right.
PRIDE: No, no, no.

14:30.791 --> 14:33.860
No. No, wait. Wait.

14:33.928 --> 14:36.696
Wait. Wait. Wait!

14:38.332 --> 14:40.700
You know it's a trap, right?

14:40.768 --> 14:42.235
That's why I'm going after them.

14:42.303 --> 14:43.737
A trap for you.

14:43.804 --> 14:46.940
I get it.

14:47.008 --> 14:49.509
This is--
this is all in my mind.

14:49.577 --> 14:52.078
Yeah. And it's a dangerous place
to wander alone.

14:52.146 --> 14:54.514
I'm just supposed
to trust you?

14:54.582 --> 14:56.016
Trust your instincts, Dwayne.

14:57.151 --> 14:59.119
(boy laughing)

15:21.342 --> 15:23.076
You find anything over there?

15:23.144 --> 15:25.545
Yeah. Loose floorboard with a
few thousand dollars in cash

15:25.613 --> 15:28.114
and what I think might
be a gold doubloon. You?

15:28.182 --> 15:29.626
Yeah. Found a strongbox
with some birth certificates,

15:29.650 --> 15:30.750
deed to the bar...

15:30.818 --> 15:32.652
No secret agent stuff.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.055
It's gotta be around here
someplace, right?

15:35.122 --> 15:37.223
Unless he hid it at the office,

15:37.291 --> 15:40.827
in the squad room,
cabin in the woods...

15:40.895 --> 15:42.329
(piano key makes no sound)

15:42.396 --> 15:45.932
Or... right here in the piano.
You think he hid

15:46.000 --> 15:47.400
a top secret computer
in his piano?

15:47.468 --> 15:49.235
JIMMY:
Oh, yeah. Got something.

15:49.303 --> 15:51.004
ISLER:
"In the event of my death."

15:51.072 --> 15:53.173
(knocking on door)

15:53.240 --> 15:55.608
- Who is it?
HANNAH: It's me.

15:59.380 --> 16:01.314
Hey. Anything?

16:01.382 --> 16:03.450
Personal papers, hidden cash.

16:03.517 --> 16:04.818
And death letters.

16:04.885 --> 16:06.152
Made out to
his loved ones.

16:06.220 --> 16:07.364
And to the team.
You want to see?

16:07.388 --> 16:08.873
No, I'm good. That's bad karma.

16:08.874 --> 16:09.872
Well, I'm gonna read mine.

16:09.896 --> 16:11.825
Hey, Jimmy, we're
running out of time here.

16:11.826 --> 16:13.994
Okay, Parker still thinks
I'm holding out on her.

16:14.061 --> 16:16.463
We are no closer to tracking
Pride or the double agent.

16:16.530 --> 16:18.531
(Jimmy laughing)

16:18.599 --> 16:22.469
My big brother just gave us
a map to the treasure.

16:22.536 --> 16:24.104
Do you have any idea
what he means?

16:24.171 --> 16:26.139
Well, uh, he
makes a big deal

16:26.207 --> 16:28.108
about how I should visit
our father's grave

16:28.175 --> 16:29.676
every week just like he does.

16:29.744 --> 16:31.277
Yeah. Still don't get it.

16:31.345 --> 16:33.880
Dwayne's been to visit
Cassius' grave once.

16:33.948 --> 16:35.448
The day they placed him there.

16:35.516 --> 16:38.318
Now, why do you think
he wants me to go?

16:46.027 --> 16:47.360
You stay down, all right?

16:47.428 --> 16:49.362
And out of sight.

17:00.474 --> 17:02.509
Wow.

17:02.576 --> 17:06.012
That is a lot of grave
for one man.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.847
Well, it's a family crypt.

17:07.915 --> 17:10.416
Generations
of Prides here.

17:12.319 --> 17:13.853
There's even a
place for you, Jimmy.

17:13.921 --> 17:16.923
Nah, can't be,
I'm not a Pride.

17:32.473 --> 17:34.941
Looks like there's
a screw loose.

17:37.745 --> 17:38.845
Aha!

17:40.314 --> 17:41.448
Bingo.

17:41.515 --> 17:45.051
Pride never ceases to amaze me.

17:53.427 --> 17:56.029
I was wondering why lunch
was taking such a long time.

17:56.097 --> 17:57.363
You put a tail on me?

17:57.431 --> 17:59.199
No. You would have made it.

17:59.266 --> 18:01.534
I had NSA track your car's GPS.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.036
Oh, that is completely
out of line.

18:03.104 --> 18:05.905
So is running a shadow
investigation into Apollyon...

18:05.973 --> 18:07.140
with whoever this person is.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.409
Jimmy Boyd. How you doing?

18:09.477 --> 18:10.477
I'll take that.

18:17.518 --> 18:19.452
I was gonna take it back.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.287
No, you weren't.

18:21.355 --> 18:22.989
I trusted you were above board.

18:23.057 --> 18:24.958
I learned my lesson.

18:25.025 --> 18:26.259
You're off the case, Khoury,

18:26.327 --> 18:28.928
and probably looking
at suspension.

18:28.996 --> 18:30.930
(car doors closing)

18:34.301 --> 18:35.902
What are we gonna do now?

18:35.970 --> 18:37.848
You're gonna head back to
the apartment with Isler.

18:37.872 --> 18:40.673
I'm gonna head to NCIS and
see if I can plead my case.

18:40.741 --> 18:42.308
Uh, that's gonna
be a problem.

18:42.376 --> 18:45.111
Your car is gone.

18:45.179 --> 18:46.946
So is Isler.

18:47.014 --> 18:49.449
(phone ringing)

18:49.517 --> 18:50.894
- Hello?
ISLER (over phone): It's me.

18:50.918 --> 18:52.338
HANNAH:
Where did you go?

18:52.339 --> 18:54.111
ISLER: I just saw Parker
and her people take the laptop.

18:54.112 --> 18:54.743
I'm following them.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.709
Okay, well,
get back here immediately.

18:56.710 --> 18:58.521
They're not heading to NCIS.
They're getting on the highway.

18:58.545 --> 18:59.979
I need to see where
they're going.

19:00.047 --> 19:01.424
Yeah, I did something
similar recently

19:01.448 --> 19:02.381
and got suspended.

19:02.449 --> 19:04.250
Yeah, well, I'm dead.

19:04.318 --> 19:05.818
What more can they do to me?

19:12.970 --> 19:15.305
How's our patient?

19:15.306 --> 19:17.040
Resistant.

19:17.108 --> 19:18.909
I'm adjusting the meds.

19:20.611 --> 19:22.045
It's rough, huh?

19:22.113 --> 19:25.048
Not being able to tell
reality from fantasy?

19:25.116 --> 19:26.583
I get it.

19:26.651 --> 19:28.618
It's especially hard
for a fighter.

19:28.686 --> 19:30.020
JIMMY:
Careful now, big brother.

19:30.088 --> 19:32.089
He's baiting you.

19:32.156 --> 19:33.757
What do you want from me?

19:33.825 --> 19:36.359
WALKER (chuckles):
Come on, Dwayne.

19:36.427 --> 19:39.629
There's too much respect between
us to lie, don't you think?

19:39.697 --> 19:41.598
I don't respect you.

19:43.167 --> 19:45.735
I respect you,
'cause you

19:45.803 --> 19:47.404
have the courage
of your convictions.

19:47.472 --> 19:50.207
You choose to run into
the burning building

19:50.274 --> 19:51.808
when other people flee.

19:51.876 --> 19:54.711
Man, this guy, he really knows
how to lay it on.

19:54.779 --> 19:57.881
Listen, you and I,

19:57.949 --> 20:00.917
we sacrifice everything
for our work.

20:00.985 --> 20:02.719
And it, it costs.

20:02.787 --> 20:05.122
You might find yourself
the target of a manhunt,

20:05.189 --> 20:08.825
or strapped to a chair
with no hope of survival.

20:08.893 --> 20:11.995
But never forget
what's most important.

20:12.063 --> 20:14.764
Family, Dwayne.

20:14.832 --> 20:16.500
Can't argue that.

20:16.567 --> 20:18.635
Ain't nothing more
important than family.

20:22.073 --> 20:26.143
What are you gonna do
to save yours?

20:28.846 --> 20:31.581
SEBASTIAN:
What are we looking at here?

20:31.649 --> 20:32.693
Some kind
of government facility.

20:32.717 --> 20:34.084
Yeah. I've been here before.

20:34.152 --> 20:36.887
It's a satellite relay station
for secure

20:36.954 --> 20:38.054
government communications.

20:38.122 --> 20:39.867
Gotta be a supervisor
with top security clearance

20:39.891 --> 20:41.258
to even enter.

20:41.325 --> 20:42.792
Why bring the laptop here?

20:42.860 --> 20:44.961
Maybe she's uploading to D.C.

20:45.029 --> 20:47.597
Or using our comms
to send Intel to Walker.

20:47.665 --> 20:48.909
There's no way of knowing
since she's

20:48.933 --> 20:50.100
in there and we're out here.

20:50.168 --> 20:51.835
There's one way of knowing.

20:51.903 --> 20:54.037
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:54.105 --> 20:55.983
Hannah said we're supposed
to observe and report.

20:56.007 --> 20:57.484
Nah, can't observe
from this side of the fence.

20:57.508 --> 20:59.276
I get that,
but the problem is that...

20:59.343 --> 21:00.710
Sebastian.

21:00.778 --> 21:01.811
Let's skip to the part

21:01.879 --> 21:03.213
where you agree we're going in.

21:04.081 --> 21:05.715
All right.

21:05.783 --> 21:07.227
Oh, oh. You got no
clearance to get inside.

21:07.251 --> 21:09.686
I've got bolt cutters and pliers
that say otherwise.

21:09.754 --> 21:10.931
Gregorio.
Isler, you're pretending

21:10.955 --> 21:12.722
to be dead to smoke out
this mole.

21:12.790 --> 21:14.224
Don't judge me on a little
B and E.

21:16.260 --> 21:17.861
It's just easier this way.

21:25.636 --> 21:27.571
(piano music playing)

21:39.550 --> 21:40.717
(door opening)

21:40.785 --> 21:42.719
(laughing)

21:42.787 --> 21:45.055
Hey. Hey!

21:45.122 --> 21:47.157
You're still here.

21:53.831 --> 21:55.098
LAUREL:
Dad.

21:56.934 --> 21:59.603
Laurel. Oh.

21:59.670 --> 22:02.072
It's so good to see you.

22:03.140 --> 22:04.574
We don't have time
for a reunion.

22:04.642 --> 22:06.276
- I'm in trouble.
- What do you need?

22:08.279 --> 22:11.014
- Come on. Quickly.
- Okay.

22:13.150 --> 22:14.684
Come on.

22:22.460 --> 22:24.561
Apollyon Intel?

22:24.629 --> 22:26.796
The only thing that can save me
is in that pile.

22:27.865 --> 22:29.466
Let's find it together, Daddy.

22:29.533 --> 22:31.601
Okay, baby.

22:39.610 --> 22:40.610
That's the one.

22:41.812 --> 22:43.713
Why do you need this one?

22:43.781 --> 22:44.901
Just read it to me. Can you?

22:46.317 --> 22:48.051
No.

22:50.021 --> 22:51.621
No, I c... I can't.

22:51.689 --> 22:52.689
Daddy, please.

22:56.861 --> 22:58.728
I'm sorry.

22:58.796 --> 22:59.796
Help me!

23:02.533 --> 23:04.267
Did I do that?

23:05.369 --> 23:06.803
Laurel?

23:06.871 --> 23:08.805
Laurel?

23:10.041 --> 23:11.975
What's going on?

23:12.043 --> 23:14.511
You want him
to recall something specific

23:14.578 --> 23:16.813
from his subconscious.
It's a process.

23:16.881 --> 23:19.516
Requires patience.
(sighs)

23:19.583 --> 23:21.818
(phone vibrating)

23:21.886 --> 23:23.153
Huh.

23:23.220 --> 23:25.789
Might not require patience
after all.

23:25.856 --> 23:27.123
That went well.

23:27.191 --> 23:29.125
(continues indistinctly)

23:32.897 --> 23:35.098
(beeps, door unlocks)
GREGORIO: Damn.

23:35.166 --> 23:36.910
- Key card entry.
- Yeah, I didn't see that coming.

23:36.934 --> 23:37.934
Can you hack it?

23:38.002 --> 23:39.202
SEBASTIAN:
Course I can.

23:39.270 --> 23:41.504
Here goes felony number two.

23:46.377 --> 23:47.977
Is every NCIS agent

23:48.045 --> 23:49.279
completely insubordinate,

23:49.347 --> 23:50.757
or is it just
the New Orleans office?

23:50.781 --> 23:52.225
What are you doing
with the Apollyon files?

23:52.249 --> 23:53.817
This is my investigation.

23:53.884 --> 23:55.924
We're in the middle of a
secure government facility.

23:55.953 --> 23:57.454
Who do you think
I'm sending it to?

23:57.521 --> 23:59.856
Avery Walker.

23:59.924 --> 24:01.268
- She's reaching for something.
- Relax.

24:01.292 --> 24:02.492
It's my phone.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.160
I'm calling security
to have you removed.

24:04.228 --> 24:05.405
GREGORIO: We should
all go to security,

24:05.429 --> 24:06.796
sort this thing out.

24:06.864 --> 24:10.200
Nothing to sort out. I've got
clearance to be here. You don't.

24:10.267 --> 24:11.331
Oh, whoa, okay.
Are we doing this?

24:11.355 --> 24:12.102
GREGORIO: Yeah.

24:12.103 --> 24:14.537
Cover me. I'm gonna detain
Special Agent Parker.

24:14.605 --> 24:16.406
I'm done, anyway.

24:16.474 --> 24:18.308
Sebastian,
stop whatever she did!

24:18.376 --> 24:19.509
(grunting)

24:28.252 --> 24:30.153
Don't even think about it.
(Sebastian groans)

24:32.156 --> 24:33.857
What the hell did you do?

24:33.924 --> 24:35.402
It was uploading,
and I couldn't stop it,

24:35.426 --> 24:38.061
so I, uh... I shot it.

24:38.129 --> 24:39.696
(door opens)

24:39.764 --> 24:42.031
Hands in the air! All of you.

24:42.099 --> 24:44.033
- Hope it works.
- Yeah. Me, too.

24:50.940 --> 24:52.541
This is a first for me.

24:52.608 --> 24:53.975
Got two federal agents

24:54.043 --> 24:55.087
brawling like
it's the main event

24:55.111 --> 24:56.144
and a third discharging

24:56.212 --> 24:57.846
his weapon
into my computer servers.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.247
I need one of you to explain.

24:59.315 --> 24:59.986
I can do that.

25:00.010 --> 25:01.917
He's a snake.
Well, here's the deal...

25:01.918 --> 25:02.918
<i>One</i> of you.

25:02.985 --> 25:04.085
NCIS has reason to believe

25:04.153 --> 25:06.054
that Agent Parker is a traitor

25:06.122 --> 25:07.856
working for Apollyon.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.782
SECURITY CHIEF: I have no idea
what Apollyon is.

25:09.783 --> 25:10.058
SEBASTIAN: Oh, right.

25:10.126 --> 25:11.526
It's this, uh, super secret...

25:11.594 --> 25:13.662
And I don't care.
Special Agent Parker

25:13.729 --> 25:15.774
is the only one with permission
to be in my facility.

25:15.798 --> 25:16.831
Then if you will...

25:16.899 --> 25:18.266
Sorry I'm late.

25:18.334 --> 25:21.269
Rita Devereaux, DOJ,
National Security Division.

25:21.337 --> 25:23.104
PARKER:
Parker, Homeland Security.

25:23.172 --> 25:24.506
Those are your two suspects.

25:24.574 --> 25:26.675
Actually, I'm here for you.
You're being detained

25:26.742 --> 25:29.444
by the FBI
under suspicion of treason.

25:29.512 --> 25:31.580
- Based on?
- The unregistered cell phone

25:31.647 --> 25:33.926
found in your personal effects
with messages to an individual

25:33.950 --> 25:35.917
we believe to be Avery Walker.

25:35.985 --> 25:37.085
That is not...

25:37.153 --> 25:38.463
And payments
you've been receiving

25:38.487 --> 25:40.332
to an offshore account
under your dead mother's name.

25:40.356 --> 25:41.600
Best we could figure,
you were turned

25:41.624 --> 25:43.124
three years ago.

25:43.192 --> 25:45.694
Betrayed your own team
and got them all killed.

25:45.761 --> 25:46.962
If you'll let me explain...

25:47.029 --> 25:48.229
You can explain to the FBI.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.908
They're dying to hear
what you have to say.

25:49.932 --> 25:51.399
GREGORIO:
Catch you later.

25:53.536 --> 25:56.204
Will you uncuff them, please?
They're coming with me.

25:56.272 --> 25:57.583
SECURITY CHIEF: There's still the
matter of the servers

25:57.607 --> 25:58.873
this one sabotaged.

25:58.941 --> 26:00.542
I'll be taking those, too.

26:00.610 --> 26:01.643
Do you have a warrant?

26:01.711 --> 26:03.878
Warrant is right here.

26:03.946 --> 26:05.614
Now, if you'll excuse us.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.159
Thank you.

26:08.183 --> 26:09.050
SEBASTIAN:
Look, don't get us wrong.

26:09.051 --> 26:10.251
We're pumped to see you,

26:10.319 --> 26:11.496
but how'd you even know
that we were here?

26:11.520 --> 26:13.288
I was already on my
way down from D.C.

26:13.356 --> 26:14.800
after I'd heard about
what happened to Dwayne.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.335
But then I got a call
from Raymond Isler,

26:16.359 --> 26:17.592
which was disconcerting

26:17.660 --> 26:18.893
considering he's dead.

26:18.961 --> 26:20.295
- We can explain.
- Yes.

26:20.363 --> 26:21.540
Explain later. We need
to get those servers

26:21.564 --> 26:22.931
back to NCIS.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.233
May be our best lead
on getting Dwayne home.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.143
You sure you're ready,
Sebastian?

26:35.211 --> 26:36.578
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, are you kidding me?

26:36.646 --> 26:38.680
My first autopsy,
<i>and</i> it's on somebody I know?

26:39.482 --> 26:40.515
WADE:
It was inevitable

26:40.583 --> 26:42.023
that Dwayne would
end up on my table.

26:42.051 --> 26:44.152
Of course, he suffered
needlessly to get here.

26:44.220 --> 26:46.198
Yeah, well, least we'll get
to see what makes him tick.

26:46.222 --> 26:48.790
Well, what are you waiting for?
Open the man up.

26:48.858 --> 26:50.659
All right.

26:50.726 --> 26:52.627
No, wait, wait.

26:53.763 --> 26:54.996
I'm-I'm not dead.

26:55.064 --> 26:57.465
Well, that's what
makes this so much harder.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.467
Just stop being so stubborn,

26:59.535 --> 27:01.970
Dwayne,
and give Walker what he wants.

27:02.038 --> 27:04.673
- I can't.
- Then we've really got no choice.

27:05.941 --> 27:07.175
(saw whirring)

27:10.613 --> 27:11.646
Put down the saw.

27:11.714 --> 27:14.649
Saw? What the hell
is going on with him?

27:14.717 --> 27:16.685
I can't control his mind.
I can only nudge him.

27:16.752 --> 27:18.820
My operative
on the ground just failed,

27:18.888 --> 27:20.098
so he is the only
option we've got.

27:20.122 --> 27:22.057
Nudge harder!

27:22.124 --> 27:24.292
Get him back on the damn file.

27:30.066 --> 27:31.199
How long before we land?

27:31.267 --> 27:32.267
30 minutes, sir.

27:36.038 --> 27:38.139
I just spoke to the FBI.

27:38.207 --> 27:40.075
Parker threw herself
on their mercy,

27:40.142 --> 27:41.810
admitted everything,
but has no idea

27:41.877 --> 27:43.255
where Walker or Dwayne might be.
- (scoffs)

27:43.279 --> 27:45.013
- She's probably lying.
- It doesn't matter.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.981
We don't have time
to interrogate her properly.

27:47.049 --> 27:48.183
LASALLE:
Not gonna need to.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.684
Patton was able
to get a new bead

27:49.752 --> 27:51.352
on Walker's
communication signal.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.432
Despite the fact that
Sebastian murdered the servers

27:53.456 --> 27:54.433
in cold blood.

27:54.457 --> 27:55.390
I was improvising.
I don't know...

27:55.391 --> 27:56.991
Okay.
What did you learn, Patton?

27:57.059 --> 28:00.228
I figured out why the signals
keep bouncing around.

28:00.296 --> 28:03.031
They're literally moving.
500 miles an hour.

28:03.099 --> 28:04.332
Walker's on a plane.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.544
Yeah, one that's
been traveling west

28:05.568 --> 28:07.035
from Eastern Europe for hours.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.403
PATTON:
And he just landed

28:08.471 --> 28:09.571
in the good old U.S. of A.

28:09.638 --> 28:10.739
Yeah, Brownsville, Texas,

28:10.806 --> 28:12.741
to be precise.

28:12.808 --> 28:14.743
Estate on the Gulf
near the Mexican border.

28:14.810 --> 28:16.745
Used to be owned by
the cartel kingpin.

28:16.812 --> 28:18.213
It's been dormant for years.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.681
But why would Walker head back

28:19.749 --> 28:21.583
to the United States
if he's a wanted man?

28:21.650 --> 28:23.384
More importantly,
is Dwayne with him?

28:25.121 --> 28:27.722
There's only one way
to find out. Let's roll.

28:29.325 --> 28:30.859
What is that place, Patton?

28:30.926 --> 28:32.894
Walker's own personal Alamo.

28:41.670 --> 28:43.538
Where am I?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.574
Doesn't matter.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.144
Room's different, circumstances
are still the same.

28:49.211 --> 28:51.089
(whimpers)
- Let's cut right to the heart of the matter.

28:51.113 --> 28:53.615
Now, you know what I want.

28:53.682 --> 28:55.283
My personnel file.

28:55.351 --> 28:56.584
(grunts)

28:56.652 --> 28:58.953
Now, no more denials.

28:59.021 --> 29:00.288
No distractions.

29:00.356 --> 29:01.600
- You understand me?
- I don't...

29:01.624 --> 29:03.224
I know that you have read

29:03.292 --> 29:05.560
every single word in that file.

29:05.628 --> 29:08.429
And there is something
that I need from it.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.098
(grunts)

29:15.738 --> 29:17.672
(panting)

29:17.740 --> 29:20.475
♪ Like smooth wine

29:20.543 --> 29:22.410
♪ It's like heaven

29:22.478 --> 29:26.314
♪ In the room with you

29:26.382 --> 29:29.818
♪ And we're awake in...

29:29.885 --> 29:33.254
(exhales)
I know what you're thinking.

29:33.322 --> 29:35.590
Everything seems just right.

29:35.658 --> 29:37.926
Like I'm home.

29:37.993 --> 29:41.329
This could be
forever if you want.

29:41.397 --> 29:43.331
What do you mean?

29:43.399 --> 29:46.134
I mean forget about
the world.

29:46.202 --> 29:49.003
Let it slip away.
Be here with me.

29:49.071 --> 29:50.772
I want that.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.608
- I got you something.
- What...?

29:53.676 --> 29:55.677
(chuckles)
- (scoffs)

29:55.744 --> 29:57.645
(laughs)

29:57.713 --> 30:00.882
♪ Give you a kiss or two...

30:00.950 --> 30:03.151
Go ahead.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.019
(chuckles)

30:13.863 --> 30:15.496
I can't.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.465
Well, of course you can.

30:17.533 --> 30:19.467
For me. For us.

30:23.205 --> 30:25.640
Oh, this self-righteous crap

30:25.708 --> 30:27.742
only goes so far, Dwayne.

30:27.810 --> 30:29.774
You claim you want to help
the ones you love.

30:29.798 --> 30:30.411
Rita, please.

30:30.412 --> 30:33.548
But you've sacrificed
your marriage, your daughter,

30:33.616 --> 30:36.050
any substantial relationship
you've ever had.

30:36.118 --> 30:38.186
- And for what?
- This-this isn't real.

30:38.254 --> 30:40.221
- This...
- That file is real, and what's inside

30:40.289 --> 30:41.656
is your only hope
to save us.

30:41.724 --> 30:42.924
But you don't care.

30:42.992 --> 30:44.158
No, that's not true.

30:44.226 --> 30:46.094
Do the honorable thing
for once in your life.

30:46.161 --> 30:49.097
Open the damn file
and tell me what's inside.

30:49.164 --> 30:52.233
Otherwise, we all are dead.

31:06.602 --> 31:07.958
Just checked the perimeter.

31:07.959 --> 31:10.727
There's eight guys to my count.
Probably more inside.

31:10.795 --> 31:12.293
- Well, any sign of Pride or Walker?
- No.

31:12.294 --> 31:13.360
They could be inside, too.

31:13.428 --> 31:14.895
We go in.

31:14.963 --> 31:16.764
FBI and HRT are ready.
So are the Rangers.

31:16.832 --> 31:18.142
SEBASTIAN: A firefight
could get Pride killed.

31:18.166 --> 31:19.377
HANNAH:
I'm not seeing much of a choice.

31:19.401 --> 31:21.569
We've come this far to get King.

31:21.636 --> 31:23.504
No turning back now.

31:23.572 --> 31:26.107
This is Khoury. We're a go.

31:32.581 --> 31:34.448
What's happening out there?

31:34.516 --> 31:35.583
It's the Feds.

31:35.650 --> 31:36.917
AGENT:
Federal agents!

31:36.985 --> 31:38.119
Everyone drop your weapons

31:38.186 --> 31:39.386
and get on the ground!

31:47.195 --> 31:48.229
JONES:
We should go.

31:48.296 --> 31:50.097
We need to finish the mission.

31:50.165 --> 31:52.099
- We don't have any time.
- He's right there

31:52.167 --> 31:54.368
in that house with the
information that I need.

31:54.436 --> 31:54.980
(grunts)

31:55.004 --> 31:57.081
Pride, listen to me.
Look, look, I need you to focus.

31:57.105 --> 31:58.606
Okay? I need you to tell me

31:58.673 --> 31:59.940
where you are right now.

32:01.143 --> 32:02.320
OFFICER:
This is the Coast Guard.

32:02.344 --> 32:04.411
Put your weapons down
and surrender.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.453
Tell me! Come on!

32:12.521 --> 32:15.623
I can't open that file.

32:15.690 --> 32:17.491
I don't care about the file.

32:18.794 --> 32:20.227
Tell me about the house.

32:20.295 --> 32:22.263
Tell me
about the house.

32:30.138 --> 32:32.139
(woman singing in French)

32:48.256 --> 32:50.925
(continues singing)

32:53.061 --> 32:54.995
Mama?

32:56.865 --> 32:58.666
You look good.

32:58.733 --> 33:00.634
Not sick.

33:03.338 --> 33:05.439
Young.

33:05.507 --> 33:08.843
Don't be troubled, Dwayne.

33:08.910 --> 33:11.212
It's a beautiful day.

33:12.581 --> 33:14.949
Look how happy he is.

33:19.387 --> 33:21.322
Is that me?

33:23.058 --> 33:24.792
Have we been here?

33:24.860 --> 33:27.228
Oh, no, we've
never been here.

33:27.295 --> 33:29.830
And I don't know the boy.

33:29.898 --> 33:32.666
But I like him quite a bit.

33:32.734 --> 33:35.035
It all seems
so familiar.

33:35.103 --> 33:36.704
(sighs)

33:36.771 --> 33:38.539
You have all the answers.

33:39.908 --> 33:42.710
You just have to look.

33:49.651 --> 33:53.654
No. I can't.

33:53.722 --> 33:55.322
I can't. (sighs)

33:56.992 --> 33:59.159
I can't do this anymore.

33:59.227 --> 34:01.729
I don't even know
what I'm fighting for.

34:04.266 --> 34:07.534
This is not the Dwayne Pride
that I raised.

34:07.602 --> 34:11.237
You stood your ground
when your father disappeared.

34:11.306 --> 34:15.175
And when your mother lost
a part of her reality.

34:15.243 --> 34:18.112
Don't you give up now.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.960
This isn't about me.

34:34.029 --> 34:35.963
It's about Walker.

34:40.467 --> 34:42.703
721...

34:42.771 --> 34:44.772
Walnut Lane.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.376
That's my son.

34:50.645 --> 34:53.414
I am so proud of you.

34:55.884 --> 34:58.319
I just gave Walker
everything he wants.

34:58.386 --> 35:00.321
You never had a choice
about that.

35:02.023 --> 35:05.359
But you do have a choice
about what happens next.

35:07.629 --> 35:09.630
Fight.

35:11.232 --> 35:13.734
Dwayne, you fight.

35:17.539 --> 35:20.607
(singing in French)

35:38.560 --> 35:40.004
You stay here with him.
I'll check it out.

35:40.028 --> 35:41.428
What am I supposed
to do with this?

35:41.496 --> 35:43.530
I got what I need from him.

35:43.598 --> 35:45.032
Clean up.

35:46.167 --> 35:48.635
(sighs)

35:50.405 --> 35:53.507
(groans softly)

35:53.575 --> 35:55.709

35:57.078 --> 35:59.380

36:00.915 --> 36:02.783

<i>your marriage, your daughter.</i>

<i>relationship you've ever had.</i>

36:13.505 --> 36:14.973
And for what?
(grunts)

36:15.040 --> 36:16.407
We all are dead.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.943
(grunting)

36:19.011 --> 36:22.280
JIMMY: <i>Can't argue that.Ain't nothing</i>
<i>more important than family.</i>

36:22.348 --> 36:26.451
<i>What are you gonna do</i>
<i>to save yours?</i>

36:28.721 --> 36:30.688
Walker!

36:31.390 --> 36:34.525
Dwayne... don't shoot.

36:37.997 --> 36:39.297
LASALLE:
King!

36:39.365 --> 36:40.465
It's me.

36:43.002 --> 36:44.769
Lower your weapon!

36:45.871 --> 36:47.805
King!

36:48.941 --> 36:51.809
Hey. Hey.
King, it's me.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.811
It's all right.

36:58.450 --> 36:59.951
(siren wailing)

37:00.019 --> 37:01.819
(coughing)

37:05.891 --> 37:08.559
We have seven Apollyon
operatives in custody.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.405
We still don't know where Walker went.
GREGORIO: My guess is

37:10.429 --> 37:12.797
he's over the border. He's gonna
be impossible to find.

37:12.865 --> 37:15.867
Good news-- you're
gonna be okay, King.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.069
Soon as we pump these drugs
out of your system.

37:18.137 --> 37:19.804
Not impossible.

37:19.872 --> 37:21.916
- Yeah, right, just a couple days rest.
- No. I mean,

37:21.940 --> 37:24.375
it's not impossible...

37:24.443 --> 37:26.344
to find Walker.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.814
I know where he's going.

37:29.882 --> 37:31.749
(panting)

37:31.817 --> 37:33.918
721 Walnut Lane.

37:52.004 --> 37:54.238
(panting)

37:54.306 --> 37:56.374
Why am I not surprised
that you survived?

37:56.442 --> 37:58.176
Or that you tracked me here?

37:58.243 --> 38:00.545
Drugs did a number on me.

38:00.612 --> 38:04.782
No idea what was real,
or what was fake,

38:04.850 --> 38:06.884
but this place stood out.

38:06.952 --> 38:10.555
I figured that the kid
in this photo was you.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.523
But the family
who lives here

38:12.591 --> 38:14.192
has no connection to you.

38:14.259 --> 38:15.526
Except for one thing.

38:15.594 --> 38:17.528
The boy is your son.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.931
They adopted him.

38:19.998 --> 38:23.101
You know, having children in
this line of work is dangerous.

38:23.168 --> 38:24.435
His mother--

38:24.503 --> 38:26.537
she didn't survive childbirth,
so...

38:26.605 --> 38:29.240
I had
to put him somewhere safe.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.142
Somewhere even
you didn't know about.

38:31.210 --> 38:34.545
Somewhere where he could just
live a normal life.

38:34.613 --> 38:37.081
But Amelia Parsons--
she figured it out.

38:37.149 --> 38:39.317
She used that picture
as leverage on me.

38:39.384 --> 38:42.220
And after her, you knew

38:42.287 --> 38:44.455
that we had it.

38:45.858 --> 38:48.059
I knew it was only
a matter of time

38:48.127 --> 38:49.794
before someone came for my boy.

38:49.862 --> 38:51.095
It's like
I told you.

38:51.163 --> 38:52.964
Family's everything.

38:53.031 --> 38:54.499
What was the plan?

38:56.139 --> 38:57.921
Take him?

38:57.922 --> 39:00.257
- Disappear?
- That's still my plan.

39:00.325 --> 39:02.726
Not gonna let it happen.

39:02.794 --> 39:04.928
Pride, look at you.

39:04.996 --> 39:06.597
You can barely walk,

39:06.664 --> 39:08.565
and you know
that I would kill you

39:08.633 --> 39:10.167
before you ever
pulled your weapon.

39:13.004 --> 39:14.571
I won't have to.

39:26.351 --> 39:28.552
