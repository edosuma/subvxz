00:18.342 --> 00:22.763
Sebastian, Sebastian, stop pouting.

00:22.846 --> 00:25.682
Sorry. I'm such a dope.

00:25.766 --> 00:30.812
You are not a dope. 
 You're just misguided.

00:30.896 --> 00:33.398
All the reports from your teachers 
 say the same thing:

00:33.482 --> 00:38.904
"Sebastian would make an exceptional 
 student if only he would follow orders."

00:40.030 --> 00:43.450
I can't believe you fed the school 
 hamster an overdose of Viagra.

00:43.534 --> 00:46.703
I was testing the reproductive system 
 for a science experiment...

00:46.745 --> 00:50.916
- and I wanted to see how big-- 
 - Enough! Enough!

00:50.999 --> 00:53.460
Fortunately for you, 
 you are moving to a new town.

00:53.544 --> 00:57.381
You will have a chance to start anew. 
 It's time to shape up.

00:59.383 --> 01:02.469
Speaking of shaping up, 
 how's Mrs. Freeman doing?

01:02.553 --> 01:05.513
I see she's lost some weight.

01:05.556 --> 01:07.683
- She looks good. 
 - Thank you.

01:07.766 --> 01:10.352
I gotta tell ya, 
 it's a really great thing...

01:10.435 --> 01:12.646
she's doing for the community, 
 censoring books and all.

01:12.729 --> 01:15.107
That Catcher in the Rye novel 
 really screwed me up.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.237
Mrs. Freeman knows 
 what's best for young minds.

01:20.279 --> 01:22.865
Which comes to my point.

01:22.906 --> 01:26.243
I was wondering what you planned 
 on doing with my file?

01:26.326 --> 01:28.495
- It's not very favorable and-- 
 - And...

01:28.579 --> 01:32.958
you'd prefer if I didn't forward it 
 to your new school.

01:33.041 --> 01:35.669
I've thought long and hard about it...

01:35.752 --> 01:38.213
and I've decided to send it.

01:38.255 --> 01:42.634
I mean, if you've really changed, 
 you'll rise above your past mistakes.

01:42.718 --> 01:43.969
How can I ever thank you, sir?

01:44.052 --> 01:47.931
Well, you have got a plane to catch, 
 and I have got some work to do.

01:47.973 --> 01:52.811
So, you just remember, Sebastian:

01:56.690 --> 01:59.234
The future is what you make of it.

01:59.318 --> 02:04.156
The future is what I make of it. 
 The future is what I make of it.

02:04.239 --> 02:06.617
Got it.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.702
I'll never forget you, sir.

02:08.785 --> 02:11.205
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

02:13.874 --> 02:15.792
Pansy.

02:22.841 --> 02:23.967
Ed Freeman.

02:24.051 --> 02:26.428
What the fuck have you done tome, 
 you fucking asshole?

02:26.470 --> 02:27.596
What's wrong, pumpkin?

02:27.638 --> 02:30.057
Have you seen my picture 
 in the school yearbook?

02:30.140 --> 02:33.101
Uh, yes, you look wonderful.

02:33.143 --> 02:36.146
Wonderful? 
 I'm naked, you fucking idiot!

02:36.188 --> 02:38.273
Fuck.

02:38.357 --> 02:42.569
I'm the laughingstock of the community. 
 How could you have let this happen?

02:42.653 --> 02:46.615
You weaselly little piece of shit! 
 You'll pay for this!

02:49.368 --> 02:51.870
Ed, I hate you!

02:51.954 --> 02:55.165
Asshole!

03:03.715 --> 03:05.217
Don't think you are gonna get away 
 with this stunt.

03:05.300 --> 03:08.053
- So where you heading? 
 - New York City.

03:08.136 --> 03:10.931
- And I'm sending your file! 
 - For you.

03:11.014 --> 03:13.684
- Thanks. 
 - You are finished!

03:16.520 --> 03:18.438
Bye-bye.

04:05.485 --> 04:07.738
- Sebastian Valmont? 
 - Yeah.

04:07.821 --> 04:11.366
I'll take care of the driver, sir. 
 Your family's expecting you.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.911
Which apartment?

04:13.994 --> 04:16.579
The whole building, sir.

04:16.663 --> 04:20.209
Of course. 
 What was I thinking?

04:22.586 --> 04:25.047
Oh, my God!

04:42.147 --> 04:44.733
Sebastian Valmont 
 to see you, sir.

04:44.775 --> 04:48.403
- Ah, good to see you again, son. 
 - Good to see you, too, Dad.

04:50.155 --> 04:51.615
How's your mother?

04:51.657 --> 04:56.745
Oh, Dr. Rappaport thinks she's gonna 
 be in rehab for the long haul.

04:56.828 --> 04:59.831
Thanks for taking me in. You know, 
 foster homes just aren't my thing.

04:59.915 --> 05:01.750
Think nothing of it.

05:02.459 --> 05:04.795
Man, you really hit 
 the mother lode this time, Pops.

05:04.836 --> 05:10.217
Sebastian, I would like you to meet 
 the love of my life.

05:11.301 --> 05:13.428
This is Tiffany.

05:13.512 --> 05:16.265
Well, it's a pleasure 
 to finally meet you.

05:16.306 --> 05:19.434
I see you have your father's 
 beautiful blue eyes.

05:19.518 --> 05:21.311
Thank you.

05:21.353 --> 05:25.524
My, what a precious little 
 kitty you have.

05:26.441 --> 05:29.152
Would you like to pet her?

05:29.194 --> 05:33.156
Some other time. 
 Sebastian, come meet Kathryn.

05:36.410 --> 05:40.205
I've heard so much about you. 
 Welcome to the family.

05:42.541 --> 05:47.754
I've always wanted a brother, but they 
 were sold out of them at Bloomingdale's.

05:48.505 --> 05:51.300
- Is that a real Steinway? 
 - I wouldn't play anything else.

05:51.341 --> 05:54.052
- May I? 
 - Be my guest.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.013
Kathryn is an exquisite pianist, 
 Sebastian.

05:56.054 --> 05:57.639
Really?

06:01.685 --> 06:03.186
Cute.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.035
I think it needs a tuning.

06:21.038 --> 06:25.125
Mother, Sebastian must be famished. 
 Shouldn't we check on dinner?

06:25.209 --> 06:27.920
I think that's a wonderful idea.

06:30.505 --> 06:33.842
I'm so excited you'll be starting 
 Manchester with me tomorrow.

06:33.884 --> 06:36.511
It's a wonderful institution...

06:36.553 --> 06:38.680
- with wonderful teachers. 
 - Wonderful.

06:38.764 --> 06:41.350
Kathryn is president 
 of the student body.

06:41.391 --> 06:43.352
Let's not forget president 
 of the French Club.

06:44.895 --> 06:47.314
I live for extracurricular activities.

06:47.397 --> 06:50.484
Student body president? 
 I thought you were a sophomore.

06:50.567 --> 06:54.363
I am. I believe one should not 
 be hampered in achieving one's goals...

06:54.404 --> 06:57.783
simply by the paltriness 
 of one's years.

06:57.866 --> 07:00.744
- You mean "dearth." 
 - Excuse me.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.873
Well, paltriness 
 implies insignificance...

07:04.915 --> 07:08.210
but really it's your lack of age 
 that shouldn't hamper you...

07:08.252 --> 07:09.711
from achieving your goals.

07:09.753 --> 07:13.173
Careful with those SAT words. 
 They can be deadly.

07:13.257 --> 07:15.217
Thank you.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.220
Isn't Kathryn just the best, son?

07:19.388 --> 07:23.058
- Yeah, she's a real peach, Dad. 
 - I love you, Step daddy.

07:26.144 --> 07:29.815
I'm a little tired from all the travel. 
 Do you mind if I turn in?

07:29.898 --> 07:34.987
Not at all. I know you have 
 a big day ahead of you tomorrow.

07:35.070 --> 07:37.531
I'll show you to your room.

07:38.991 --> 07:42.160
Hey, you little asshole. 
 What do you think you're doing?

07:42.244 --> 07:44.955
- I was not-- What? 
 - You hear me? Get down there!

07:44.997 --> 07:46.081
Do not fuck with me.

07:46.164 --> 07:48.208
So...

07:48.292 --> 07:53.463
he outdoes you at piano, 
 he outdoes you at vocabulary.

07:53.505 --> 07:55.465
I guess I overestimated you.

07:57.134 --> 08:00.178
And don't sulk. 
 It's a sign of weakness.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.723
Yes, Mother.

08:04.641 --> 08:08.896
No, everything's fine. 
 I was just checking up on you, Mom.

08:08.979 --> 08:11.648
Look, I promised 
 I'd take care of you, right?

08:11.732 --> 08:14.985
Well, I'm gonna talk to Dad 
 and get you into a better facility.

08:15.027 --> 08:17.487
It's the least he can do.

08:19.531 --> 08:21.491
I love you too.

08:33.544 --> 08:35.047
- What the-- 
 - Let's get something straight!

08:35.130 --> 08:38.967
I may not have fooled you, but I've got 
 a great thing going with the rentals.

08:39.009 --> 08:41.345
I don't have a curfew, they never 
 bother me about my homework...

08:41.385 --> 08:43.263
and I've got a five-figure allowance.

08:43.347 --> 08:47.935
No one-- and I mean no one-- is about 
 to threaten my cushy lifestyle...

08:48.018 --> 08:50.437
especially not some 
 two-bit hick loser.

08:50.520 --> 08:53.023
- But-- 
 - I don't wanna hear it.

08:53.106 --> 08:55.943
Now, as for school, 
 you stay out of my face...

08:56.026 --> 08:58.779
and we'll get along just fine, 
 but if you cross me once...

08:58.862 --> 09:03.617
I'll bury your sorry ass, 
 understood?

09:03.700 --> 09:07.037
All right. I'm glad we could have 
 this little discussion.

09:09.581 --> 09:12.042
Hmm. Not bad.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.771
- What's the matter? 
 - This collar's too tight.

09:32.854 --> 09:36.858
Oh, I guess you're only used to wearing 
 mesh shirts where you come from.

09:39.736 --> 09:42.197
More SAT vocabulary builders?

09:42.281 --> 09:46.368
For your information, this happens 
 to be my orientation speech.

09:46.451 --> 09:47.744
Who are you orienting?

09:48.787 --> 09:50.664
Please, be more stupid.

09:50.747 --> 09:53.625
I am the student body president.

09:53.709 --> 09:57.087
Ivy League schools eat this 
 extracurricular crap up for supper.

09:58.422 --> 10:00.549
You do know 
 what an Ivy League school is?

10:11.602 --> 10:12.895
Stop!

10:14.563 --> 10:18.442
Gordon Anderson-- 
 looking good.

10:20.611 --> 10:23.572
Do me a favor. 
 Pretend you don't know me.

10:56.897 --> 10:59.274
My God, you're beautiful.

11:01.151 --> 11:04.738
- Excuse me? 
 - Oh, I said you were beautiful.

11:06.156 --> 11:07.282
Thank you.

11:10.494 --> 11:13.080
Excuse me, but what did you mean 
 by that remark?

11:14.498 --> 11:16.750
- What remark? 
 - That I'm beautiful.

11:18.335 --> 11:20.796
- Well, aren't you? 
 - Well, yeah.

11:20.879 --> 11:24.049
I mean, no, no, but--

11:25.592 --> 11:27.886
Never mind.

11:29.638 --> 11:31.056
You're very strange.

11:32.808 --> 11:34.059
I know.

11:36.895 --> 11:39.064
Are you here to see 
 the headmaster?

11:39.147 --> 11:42.651
Yeah. 
 I heard he's a total joke.

11:42.693 --> 11:44.695
I wouldn't know.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.198
The headmaster will see you now.

11:52.661 --> 11:55.038
I must say that in all my years 
 in education...

11:55.080 --> 11:57.666
I have never seen a file 
 quite like this.

11:57.708 --> 12:01.753
4.0 GPA, president of several clubs...

12:01.837 --> 12:04.798
all-star snowboarding 
 for your county...

12:04.882 --> 12:08.427
as well as several glowing letters 
 from your teachers...

12:08.510 --> 12:10.512
including your former principal.

12:10.596 --> 12:13.473
We were very close, he and I, sir.

12:13.557 --> 12:16.852
- Yes, it's most impressive. 
 - Thank you.

12:16.894 --> 12:20.230
Perhaps a little too impressive.

12:21.815 --> 12:23.358
Thank you.

12:23.400 --> 12:27.821
That aside, I'm sure an enterprising 
 young man like yourself...

12:27.905 --> 12:30.365
would be a welcome addition 
 here at Manchester.

12:31.575 --> 12:34.161
- Thank you, sir. 
 - Come in.

12:38.415 --> 12:41.877
You had a few grammaticals, 
 but nothing reprehensible.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.962
Thank you, honey.

12:45.589 --> 12:48.550
Sebastian, I'd like you to meet 
 my daughter, Danielle.

12:48.592 --> 12:50.219
You're both in the same class.

12:50.260 --> 12:52.804
You look familiar. 
 Have we met?

12:52.888 --> 12:55.307
No, I don't think so.

12:55.390 --> 12:57.392
Are you sure?

12:58.310 --> 13:01.146
Must've been someone else. 
 Well, I'd better get going.

13:01.230 --> 13:04.983
It was very nice meeting you, sir. 
 Ma'am.

13:07.361 --> 13:09.780
- Good luck, Sebastian. 
 - Thank you, sir.

13:17.955 --> 13:21.416
-Seems like a nice kid. Don't you think? 
 -We'll see.

13:22.501 --> 13:27.381
With our almamater 
 we will grow

13:27.464 --> 13:33.136
Hail to thee 
 O stars of pride

13:33.220 --> 13:35.138
Hail to thee

13:35.222 --> 13:39.643
Manchester

13:39.726 --> 13:42.104
Be seated.

13:44.439 --> 13:47.818
We will now hear from 
 your new student body president...

13:47.859 --> 13:49.820
Kathryn Merteuil.

13:55.409 --> 14:00.372
Fellow students, faculty, 
 administrators and custodians...

14:00.455 --> 14:05.460
I would personally like to welcome 
 each and every one of you...

14:05.502 --> 14:09.423
to what I think will be 
 Manchester's proudest year.

14:09.506 --> 14:12.050
- She is such an inspiration. 
 - I consider...

14:12.134 --> 14:14.136
each and every one of you...

14:14.177 --> 14:17.306
members of my Manchester Prep family.

14:18.640 --> 14:22.644
With that said, I feel it is 
 our responsibility to...

14:22.728 --> 14:26.481
reach out and accept 
 all new students...

14:26.523 --> 14:28.984
as members of--

14:29.026 --> 14:33.155
And accept all new students as--

14:34.907 --> 14:38.368
- Settle down, people. 
 - Please.

14:38.410 --> 14:42.497
As I was saying, I consider 
 each and every one of you...

14:42.581 --> 14:44.875
members of my Manchester Prep--

14:44.917 --> 14:49.296
- Are you all right? 
 - Sorry. It happens when I get nervous.

14:49.379 --> 14:51.298
Guess I just need a bubble gum fix.

14:52.466 --> 14:55.761
Keep going. 
 You're doing great.

14:55.844 --> 15:00.933
Thanks. Once again, 
 as I was saying...

15:01.016 --> 15:06.021
I consider each and every one 
 of you members...

15:06.063 --> 15:08.440
of my Manchester Prep family.

15:08.523 --> 15:12.486
With that said, I feel that it is 
 our responsibility to reach out...

15:12.569 --> 15:14.655
and accept all new students--

15:15.906 --> 15:18.867
Somebody! 
 Somebody do something!

15:27.709 --> 15:30.087
Somebody call 91 1 or something.

15:30.170 --> 15:32.089
Good going, Danielle.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.523
Bravo!

15:53.277 --> 15:54.861
Terrific.

16:04.288 --> 16:08.083
Right. Sparing me 
 the Cliff Notes synopsis....

16:08.125 --> 16:10.878
who can tell me what this means?

16:12.629 --> 16:14.631
Mr. Winkler.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.758
Jekyll was a doctor...

16:16.800 --> 16:19.553
and he developed this potion 
 that transformed into...

16:19.636 --> 16:22.764
Edward Hyde, his evil side.

16:22.848 --> 16:26.810
My gosh, did that answer suck.

16:28.145 --> 16:30.772
Now come on, 
 I know you've got it in you.

16:30.814 --> 16:34.943
What themes can be discussed here?

16:35.027 --> 16:36.403
Miss Sherman.

16:36.486 --> 16:40.115
I think Stevenson is talking 
 about the duality of man.

16:40.157 --> 16:42.492
Man has both good and evil in him.

16:42.534 --> 16:46.538
If man cannot suppress his evil 
 instincts, he is inevitably doomed.

16:46.622 --> 16:50.292
- Wrong! 
 - Care to elaborate on that?

16:50.334 --> 16:52.961
Nowhere in the novel does Stevenson 
 mention good over evil.

16:53.045 --> 16:55.005
In fact, it's just the opposite.

16:55.047 --> 16:57.841
Jekyll loved Hyde so much 
 that he protected him from the world.

16:57.883 --> 17:00.093
He protected Hyde 
 so he wouldn't hurt people.

17:00.177 --> 17:02.804
Please. 
 He loved hurting people.

17:02.888 --> 17:05.848
- Then why does Jekyll kill himself? 
 - Where does it say that in the book?

17:05.891 --> 17:09.936
- The end! Mr. Utterson found his body. 
 - Utterson was idiotic.

17:10.020 --> 17:12.814
- Your point is idiotic. 
 - All right, all right.

17:12.856 --> 17:15.358
Break it up, you two.

17:15.442 --> 17:17.611
Wow! 
 Am I losing my mind...

17:17.694 --> 17:20.405
or did we just witness an intellectual 
 debate in this classroom?

17:20.489 --> 17:25.327
Although I disagree 
 with your conclusions, Mr. Valmont...

17:25.368 --> 17:26.994
I do appreciate 
 your warped point of view.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.997
As for you, Miss Sherman...

17:29.039 --> 17:32.668
I think you could be a little more 
 tolerant of other people's opinions.

17:35.212 --> 17:38.674
Hey, fellas, welcome back. 
 Hey, Rene, good to see you.

17:38.715 --> 17:42.302
Assistant Headmaster Mueller!

17:51.728 --> 17:52.813
Steve.

17:52.896 --> 17:56.024
I thought I told you 
 not to call me by my first name.

17:56.066 --> 17:58.861
- We need to talk. 
 - Later. I'm busy right now.

18:01.238 --> 18:05.284
- Stop that. 
 - I said, we need to talk.

18:05.367 --> 18:07.452
What is it?

18:09.663 --> 18:12.791
Do you see something wrong? 
 I have gym.

18:12.875 --> 18:16.587
You know I loathe gym. 
 We Merteuils do not like to perspire.

18:16.670 --> 18:20.924
What is this "we Merteuils" nonsense? 
 You're a student. Try acting like one.

18:21.008 --> 18:23.594
- Excuse me? 
 - Look, Kathryn, rules are rules.

18:23.677 --> 18:27.097
- I'm sorry, but you're going to gym. 
 - I understand.

18:28.557 --> 18:33.437
- You do? 
 - Yes. But it's a bit strange...

18:33.478 --> 18:38.108
'cause isn't it against the rules for 
 someone of your age to seduce a minor...

18:38.191 --> 18:40.861
like you did to me 
 this summer in the Hamptons?

18:40.944 --> 18:45.866
Now you know that's not entirely true. 
 It was you who seduced me.

18:45.949 --> 18:48.368
You know, you're right.

18:48.452 --> 18:50.662
It was me who seduced you.

18:50.746 --> 18:53.332
But then again, 
 who will the school board believe?

18:53.415 --> 18:55.626
It's my word against yours.

18:55.709 --> 18:59.463
Think about it, Steve. Something 
 like this could ruin your career...

18:59.504 --> 19:02.049
not to mention your marriage.

19:02.132 --> 19:07.512
But I guess if you can bend 
 the rules a little, then so can I.

19:11.600 --> 19:15.395
- I'll see what I can do. 
 - You're the best.

20:02.276 --> 20:04.945
This meeting of the Manchester Tribunal 
 will now come to order.

20:05.028 --> 20:06.947
- Kathryn Merteuil presiding. 
 - Thank you, Blaine.

20:08.365 --> 20:11.952
Fellow students 
 of affluence and popularity...

20:12.035 --> 20:15.747
I welcome you to this year's first 
 meeting of the Manchester Tribunal.

20:15.831 --> 20:18.792
As your new leader, 
 I promise to do my best...

20:18.876 --> 20:23.255
to weed out the geeks, 
 losers and underprivileged...

20:23.338 --> 20:26.925
and toss their fat asses 
 out of our school.

20:39.730 --> 20:42.149
-Here's the latest shipment, Mrs. Gagin. 
 -Thank you.

20:42.232 --> 20:45.152
Could you re-shelf these for me? 
 Thanks.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.677
- My God! A cartoon cock? 
 - Hi.

21:14.431 --> 21:17.476
- Are you all right? 
 - You scared me to death.

21:21.104 --> 21:23.732
- You dropped this. 
 - I didn't drop it.

21:23.815 --> 21:26.777
Yes, you did, 
 but it's all right.

21:26.818 --> 21:28.779
Sexual curiosity is 
 nothing to be ashamed of.

21:28.820 --> 21:34.201
I'm not ashamed, and I have 
 a very healthy sexual curiosity.

21:34.284 --> 21:36.411
Really?

21:36.495 --> 21:39.873
- So what are you doing here? 
 - I work here.

21:39.957 --> 21:43.543
Do you think you can take a 1 5-minute 
 break and join me for a cup of coffee?

21:43.627 --> 21:47.089
I'd love to, but unfortunately 
 I have a lot of work to do around here.

21:49.216 --> 21:52.928
Mrs. Gagin, do you mind if Danielle 
 joins me for a coffee break?

21:52.970 --> 21:56.598
Please, go right ahead. 
 There's nothing to do right now.

21:56.640 --> 22:00.477
- Thank you. 
 - You don't quit, do you?

22:00.519 --> 22:03.939
Whatever happened to "be nice 
 to the new kid in school"?

22:07.484 --> 22:12.072
- Fifteen minutes. 
 - Go.

22:15.701 --> 22:16.785
Next.

22:18.745 --> 22:22.583
Michael Keen, freshman. 
 Former BMOC of his junior high school.

22:22.666 --> 22:26.003
Don't let his bad acne dissuade you, 
 though. His father owns the Coliseum.

22:27.880 --> 22:33.302
Let's get him a facial and see if he can 
 score front-row tickets to Hole. Next.

22:34.678 --> 22:39.016
Sebastian Valmont, sophomore. 
 Son of Edward and Corrine.

22:39.057 --> 22:40.392
- Go on. 
 - I can't.

22:40.476 --> 22:44.146
He's a transfer student, and I don't 
 have any more information on him yet.

22:44.188 --> 22:47.524
Don't you know anything else about him? 
 He is your stepbrother.

22:47.608 --> 22:50.652
I've only known him for a day. 
 He's a total loser.

22:50.694 --> 22:52.738
I mean, he shops at the Gap.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.241
Stay on him and see 
 what you can find out.

22:56.325 --> 22:57.784
- Will do. 
 - Next.

22:59.870 --> 23:02.080
Cherie Clayman, freshman.

23:02.164 --> 23:07.336
Daughter of Hubert and Bunny. 
 Annual family income--

23:07.377 --> 23:08.962
Well?

23:09.046 --> 23:11.006
$850 million.

23:11.089 --> 23:15.511
- She's richer than Kathryn. 
 - I heard that.

23:16.720 --> 23:20.307
She has a GPA of 1 .3, 
 and not only is she a virgin...

23:20.390 --> 23:22.142
but she never even kissed a boy before.

23:22.226 --> 23:24.811
Okay, this girl is 
 a walking Teletubby...

23:24.895 --> 23:27.522
just begging to be made 
 an example of.

23:27.606 --> 23:30.984
I think I'll oversee 
 this one personally.

23:31.068 --> 23:34.947
When I get through with her, she will be 
 the premiere slut at Manchester Prep.

23:39.243 --> 23:43.705
Next order of business: grievances. 
 Yes, Lauren?

23:43.789 --> 23:48.669
Well, it appears we're having a bit 
 of trouble with the new school chef.

23:48.752 --> 23:51.713
Mr. Washington seems to think 
 that sushi...

23:51.755 --> 23:55.384
is an inappropriate meal 
 for growing girls and boys.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.096
All those in favor of sending 
 Mr. Washington...

23:59.179 --> 24:01.223
back to his hot dog stand, say aye.

24:01.306 --> 24:03.100
- Aye! 
 - Aye.

24:03.183 --> 24:07.688
Okay, bye-bye, Mr. Washington. 
 Hello, Mr. Yakamoto.

24:12.651 --> 24:17.614
So, what's a nice girl like you doing 
 at a snobbish school like Manchester?

24:17.698 --> 24:22.452
It's called free tuition. 
 Besides, it's not as bad as it seems.

24:22.494 --> 24:26.206
My dad took over the place 
 a year after my mom passed away.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.624
I'm sorry.

24:29.793 --> 24:31.211
Your turn.

24:31.295 --> 24:36.925
Okay. Folks split up ten years ago. 
 Mom has a drug problem.

24:36.967 --> 24:40.846
And everyone thought it would be best 
 if I moved in with my dad.

24:40.929 --> 24:42.681
You get along with him?

24:42.764 --> 24:45.851
I don't really know him. 
 He's on his fourth marriage.

24:45.934 --> 24:48.103
- To Kathryn's mom? 
 - Yeah.

24:50.063 --> 24:55.402
I know this is rude, but what's it like 
 growing up with all that money?

24:55.486 --> 24:58.113
Well, you know, 
 I'm only one day into it.

24:59.323 --> 25:02.242
Sorry to disappoint you, my dear, 
 but Richie Rich I'm not.

25:02.326 --> 25:05.579
And I thought I was 
 the only one at Manchester.

25:06.997 --> 25:10.834
You ever get the feeling 
 you're being watched?

25:10.876 --> 25:12.669
- Yours? 
 - Hers.

25:16.256 --> 25:19.801
There you are, silly goose. 
 I've been looking all over for you.

25:19.843 --> 25:23.472
Hi, Danielle. 
 How's the used bookstore?

25:28.393 --> 25:31.355
- Don't let her get to you. 
 - She doesn't.

25:31.438 --> 25:35.859
Maybe it makes me uncool, but I don't 
 care what your stepsister thinks of me.

25:35.901 --> 25:38.820
Actually, I think 
 that makes you very cool.

25:41.031 --> 25:44.159
Well, I'd better get going. I don't 
 want her to make me hitch a ride home.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.788
- Thanks for coffee. 
 - Yeah. I'll call you later.

25:47.871 --> 25:50.207
- But you don't have my number. 
 - Don't underestimate me.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.710
Don't underestimate Kathryn.

25:53.752 --> 25:56.213
- Let's go. 
 - See you.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.048
Bye.

26:05.264 --> 26:06.723
Nice first day, retard?

26:06.765 --> 26:10.227
It was great! This uptight bitch 
 got gum stuck in her hair.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.353
Touch?.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.820
Hi.

26:19.903 --> 26:23.907
Cherie, it's Kathryn, from school. 
 No, I don't hate you.

26:23.991 --> 26:26.702
As a matter of fact, I was just 
 appointed your big sister.

26:26.743 --> 26:30.330
Can you come out tonight? 
 It's a school event. Great!

26:30.414 --> 26:33.166
I'll pick you up at 8:00. 
 See you, sweetie.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.794
You're going out with the girl 
 who spit gum in your hair?

26:35.877 --> 26:39.131
Keep your friends close 
 and your enemies closer.

26:39.214 --> 26:43.802
Come on, Kathryn. She's just a freshman. 
 Pick on someone your own size.

26:43.886 --> 26:47.055
Like you? 
 In due time.

26:48.599 --> 26:52.644
So, you have a thing 
 for boring virgins.

26:53.854 --> 26:55.564
Danielle is a virgin, you know?

26:55.606 --> 26:58.692
Careful, Kathryn. 
 I'm better at this than you.

26:58.775 --> 27:02.404
Ooh. 
 You actually have a backbone.

27:02.446 --> 27:06.575
- Don't push me, Kathryn. 
 - Any time you want to start a war--

27:06.658 --> 27:09.244
I'll keep it under consideration.

27:20.964 --> 27:22.925
36:1 5. Yeah!

27:26.470 --> 27:30.265
Good evening, Master Sebastian. 
 And how was your evening jaunt?

27:30.307 --> 27:32.809
Not bad, Henry. Not bad at all. 
 Where are the folks?

27:32.893 --> 27:35.103
Dinner with a sheik. 
 Cook has your meal ready.

27:35.145 --> 27:38.565
Will you be showering 
 before or after dinner, sir?

27:38.649 --> 27:40.234
- I hadn't really thought about it. 
 - Very well.

27:40.317 --> 27:43.946
Anything I can do to make your evening 
 more relaxing, just let me know.

27:43.987 --> 27:45.948
Thanks, Henry.

27:58.001 --> 27:59.795
This way, sir.

28:01.171 --> 28:05.425
Please make yourself comfortable. 
 G?nter has prepared sweetbread mousse.

28:15.185 --> 28:18.105
It's like dinner at the Adams Family.

28:24.361 --> 28:28.699
Guys. Hello? Anyone?

28:30.367 --> 28:32.536
Yes, sir. 
 Is everything all right?

28:32.619 --> 28:35.789
Henry, I think I'll get something later, 
 go out or something.

28:35.872 --> 28:38.333
Very well, sir. If you need the car, 
 just let Frederick know.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.877
Sure.

28:49.261 --> 28:52.472
No, it's not like that at all.

28:52.556 --> 28:55.934
- Well, of course, I miss you. 
 - You do?

28:56.018 --> 28:58.770
We'll get together very soon. 
 I promise.

28:58.854 --> 29:02.065
- Okay. 
 - What are you wearing?

29:02.149 --> 29:06.486
- Just-- Edward! 
 - I have to go.

29:06.570 --> 29:09.364
- I didn't hear you knock. 
 - I didn't.

29:09.406 --> 29:12.492
- That was my accountant on the phone. 
 - Wow!

29:12.576 --> 29:15.621
You guys must have 
 a really tight relationship.

29:17.164 --> 29:20.542
Now, look, son, 
 don't make me regret taking you in.

29:20.584 --> 29:25.422
Well, I see that old habits die hard, 
 or, in your case, don't die at all.

29:25.464 --> 29:30.636
I'm your father, and I demand to be 
 treated with some respect.

29:31.553 --> 29:35.474
- A man has needs-- 
 - Look, Dad, spare me the melodrama.

29:35.557 --> 29:37.226
But, a word of advice?

29:37.267 --> 29:41.855
You got a pretty good thing going here. 
 I wouldn't screw it up, if I were you.

29:46.485 --> 29:51.698
You know, Sebastian, I really like 
 these father-son chats.

29:51.782 --> 29:53.992
You're a real role model.

30:01.375 --> 30:04.670
Would you sit the fuck down!

30:16.473 --> 30:18.684
Thanks, Moose.

30:18.767 --> 30:20.185
Shut up, losers.

30:42.583 --> 30:45.502
One mineral water, one iced tea.

30:48.005 --> 30:49.923
This sure doesn't taste 
 like an iced tea.

30:50.007 --> 30:52.926
It's from Long Island. 
 Here, have another.

31:05.856 --> 31:09.568
- What's the latest, Kathryn? 
 - Me, as usual.

31:09.651 --> 31:11.236
Court, I'd like you to meet 
 Cherie Clayman.

31:12.779 --> 31:15.073
How's it going, Cherie?

31:15.991 --> 31:17.492
Excuse me.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.578
I think we should adjourn 
 to the ladies' room.

31:19.661 --> 31:22.247
- But I don't have to go. 
 - I do.

31:22.331 --> 31:25.417
So what do you need my help for? 
 Ow!

31:25.501 --> 31:27.169
- Want some more? 
 - No.

31:28.045 --> 31:29.504
- Back in a flash. 
 - Right.

31:32.841 --> 31:37.346
- So how do you know he likes me? 
 - I can see it in his eyes.

31:38.472 --> 31:41.642
If you say so. 
 So what do I do about it?

31:41.725 --> 31:44.144
You're gonna have to let him fuck you.

31:47.231 --> 31:49.441
But I've never even been 
 to first base with a guy.

31:49.524 --> 31:52.277
Well, so we'll start with first base 
 and then we'll move on.

31:54.238 --> 31:57.574
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.417
- Ready? 
 - Ready.

32:14.049 --> 32:16.468
- That was easy. 
 - Okay, we're gonna try this again.

32:16.552 --> 32:18.470
This time I want you 
 to close your eyes.

32:18.554 --> 32:20.639
Court's gonna stick his tongue 
 in your mouth.

32:20.722 --> 32:24.434
I want you to massage his tongue 
 with yours. Okay?

32:24.518 --> 32:26.728
Ready.

32:31.108 --> 32:33.110
You idiot! 
 These are $300 pants.

32:33.151 --> 32:35.028
I'm sorry.

32:35.112 --> 32:37.739
Oh, God! 
 Stupid bitch.

32:39.616 --> 32:41.743
He hates me.

32:45.122 --> 32:47.082
There, there. Shh.

32:56.883 --> 32:59.428
- Hello? 
 - I told you not to underestimate me.

32:59.469 --> 33:02.222
- You're unbelievable. 
 - Thank you.

33:04.975 --> 33:09.229
Oh, come on. The TV series MASH 
 was way better than the movie.

33:09.313 --> 33:11.148
- If you say so. 
 - I do.

33:11.189 --> 33:12.733
What time is it?

33:12.816 --> 33:16.361
- It's 1 0:30. 
 - We've been talking for over an hour.

33:16.445 --> 33:17.863
Whoo. Call the police.

33:17.946 --> 33:22.367
Ha-ha. I should get going. 
 Homework.

33:22.451 --> 33:25.078
Hey, listen, what are you up to 
 on Saturday?

33:25.162 --> 33:27.915
I'm looking for a tour guide 
 to show me the sights.

33:27.998 --> 33:29.917
Oh, I can't, I have plans.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.379
Come on, you gotta rescue me from my 
 psycho stepsister. At least a few hours.

33:34.463 --> 33:39.134
Look, don't you think we should 
 take this slower?

33:39.176 --> 33:41.303
You know, I don't really know you and--

33:41.345 --> 33:46.099
Take what slow? 
 I wasn't asking you on a date.

33:46.183 --> 33:48.143
- I just wanted to make a new friend. 
 - I know, I wasn't--

33:48.185 --> 33:51.772
- Man, are you conceited. 
 - No, I'm not conceited. It's just--

33:51.855 --> 33:56.902
- I have to go. 
 - Hello? Hello?

33:56.985 --> 33:59.446
Always make an impression.

34:02.199 --> 34:04.785
- Psycho stepsister? 
 - Evening.

34:04.868 --> 34:08.789
Evening. 
 Oh, she shot you down.

34:08.871 --> 34:10.873
Exactly the opposite.

34:10.958 --> 34:14.962
So what's on the agenda? 
 Matinee of The Lion King?

34:15.045 --> 34:18.382
Man, you really have it 
 out for her, don't you?

34:18.422 --> 34:22.803
It must really burn your ass that 
 with all your money and popularity...

34:22.886 --> 34:26.306
she still won't have anything 
 to do with you.

34:26.389 --> 34:28.516
Face it, Kathryn-- 
 she's outclassed you.

34:28.559 --> 34:31.395
How dare you talk to me like that, 
 you son of a bitch?

34:31.436 --> 34:33.480
Well, this has been fun.

34:34.398 --> 34:38.318
Unfortunately, I have some work to do, 
 and you have to go throw up.

34:38.402 --> 34:41.530
After all, it was a very big salad 
 you had for dinner.

34:41.612 --> 34:46.201
- Have you been spying on me? 
 - Oh, my God, I ate a crouton!

34:46.243 --> 34:49.663
We'll see who gets the last laugh, 
 brother dear.

35:04.428 --> 35:06.722
Oh, no, I'm sorry!

35:06.763 --> 35:10.142
It's all my fault. I wasn't thinking. 
 I'll get it. I'll clean it up. Sorry.

35:10.225 --> 35:13.228
It's okay. It's okay.

35:14.438 --> 35:17.983
- Stop crying. 
 -Just don't tell anyone.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.486
What is this, Ben Hur? 
 Do they beat you here?

35:21.570 --> 35:23.489
Please don't tell anyone.

35:26.241 --> 35:28.785
Min Lin, relax.

35:28.869 --> 35:31.788
Christ, it's like 
 a fucking Godzilla movie.

35:37.294 --> 35:39.713
- You girls know the routine? 
 - Seduce.

35:39.796 --> 35:41.381
And destroy.

35:44.676 --> 35:45.761
Shut up.

35:51.767 --> 35:53.185
Mm, very nice.

35:53.268 --> 35:56.355
Who the fuck are you? 
 And you?

35:56.438 --> 35:58.857
I'm Sarah, and this is Gretchen.

35:58.940 --> 36:02.444
We had a sleep over at Kathryn's, 
 and we're running a little late.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.112
Do you mind if we share your shower?

36:08.075 --> 36:11.536
- Yeah. Yeah, be my guest. 
 - Thank you.

36:19.336 --> 36:22.464
Ooh, pass me the loofah.

36:31.181 --> 36:33.141
Hey.

36:35.894 --> 36:38.564
So, what year are you guys?

36:38.647 --> 36:41.066
- We're seniors. 
 - Cool.

36:43.944 --> 36:46.446
How do you like Manchester, Sebastian?

36:46.530 --> 36:47.948
It's--

36:48.031 --> 36:51.576
It's-- it's unbelievably--

36:51.660 --> 36:55.330
- Unbelievably what? 
 - Unbelievably hard.

36:56.665 --> 37:01.003
- It certainly is. 
 - Rock hard. Down, boy.

37:03.922 --> 37:07.176
So, you guys sisters?

37:09.136 --> 37:12.055
More like kissing cousins.

37:13.682 --> 37:15.976
Whoa!

37:17.603 --> 37:20.481
Slippery when wet.

37:23.692 --> 37:26.528
So, you're seeing Danielle Sherman?

37:26.570 --> 37:28.822
Who?

37:28.906 --> 37:31.700
Oh, yeah, yeah, trying to.

37:31.742 --> 37:36.872
- She's a sweet girl. 
 - You guys would make a great couple.

37:36.914 --> 37:39.124
Just too bad you're gonna 
 miss out on all the action.

37:40.417 --> 37:42.419
- What action? 
 - Oh, come on.

37:42.461 --> 37:46.965
With the exception of Danielle, 
 Manchester Prep's a virtual whorehouse.

37:48.258 --> 37:50.427
As the school motto goes...

37:50.511 --> 37:53.180
"If you don't snort it, suck it."

37:55.140 --> 37:59.436
- Careful. 
 - He splurged.

37:59.478 --> 38:02.981
But you won't have to worry since you'll 
 be dating the headmaster's daughter.

38:03.065 --> 38:05.859
No. Guess not.

38:05.943 --> 38:07.736
- See you on campus. 
 - Ring toss.

38:08.654 --> 38:09.738
Score.

38:09.822 --> 38:12.157
Yes!

38:13.116 --> 38:16.536
Thanks for, you know, sharing.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.790
- Here, sis, I'll dry you off. 
 - Thanks.

38:19.873 --> 38:21.542
Shit.

38:29.967 --> 38:32.469
Breakfast was late, 
 my skirt is mussed...

38:32.511 --> 38:34.596
and I needed the car last night.

38:34.638 --> 38:37.724
- I'm sorry, Miss Merteuil-- 
 - No excuses!

38:37.808 --> 38:41.728
Now, just because my mother is out 
 of town does not mean you can slack off.

38:41.812 --> 38:45.107
Each lapse, each oversight, 
 will be reported.

38:45.148 --> 38:47.192
Good, you haven't left.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.737
What's this? 
 Saddam addressing the troops?

38:50.821 --> 38:53.157
- Allow me, sir. 
 - No, it's all right, Henry.

38:53.240 --> 38:56.785
There, there, sir. Pay close attention. 
 The perfect Windsor is an art.

38:56.868 --> 39:00.455
- Rough night last night? 
 - There was a pea under my mattress.

39:00.539 --> 39:03.625
- I'll look into it, sir. 
 - No, Henry, it was great. It was a ten.

39:03.709 --> 39:07.546
Can we go now, 
 or do we send Kapoor in our place?

39:07.629 --> 39:10.299
I almost forgot. 
 Here are your allowances.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.887
What's this? 
 Annual? Semiannual?

39:15.971 --> 39:20.267
- Weekly, of course. 
 - This is amazing.

39:20.350 --> 39:24.271
The leftovers, sir. 
 It's what I like to call mad money.

39:24.354 --> 39:26.273
Yeah, mad.

39:27.357 --> 39:31.111
Unless you use it 
 to make someone happy.

39:31.194 --> 39:33.530
For the Windsor and the advice.

39:33.614 --> 39:36.825
Thank you, sir. 
 Thank you very much. Very kind.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.870
Tutor me in French? 
 Tutor me in French?

39:39.953 --> 39:42.497
Danielle! Oh, my gosh, 
 am I glad I found you?

39:42.539 --> 39:45.292
Look, I am flunking French, 
 like tres flunking it.

39:45.375 --> 39:48.378
- Last quiz: D-minus. 
 - Have you been studying?

39:48.462 --> 39:53.091
Of course, I study like crazy, but it 
 just goes in one hole and out the other.

39:53.175 --> 39:56.011
- Well, I wish I could help you. 
 - You can! You can tutor me.

39:56.053 --> 39:59.556
Mom said I can pay you, unless 
 that's like too totally insulting...

39:59.640 --> 40:01.892
because, you know, we've got money, 
 and you're the headmaster's daughter...

40:01.975 --> 40:04.311
and headmasters make, like, zilch.

40:04.394 --> 40:06.188
Thanks.

40:06.230 --> 40:10.442
Tutor me, please, please. 
 I'll pay you $200 an hour, $200.

40:10.525 --> 40:14.154
Stop. Of course I'll tutor you. 
 The money doesn't matter.

40:14.238 --> 40:18.450
Going rate will be fine. God, why does 
 everything have to be about money?

40:18.533 --> 40:20.118
'Cause it's cool.

40:25.374 --> 40:28.418
- Do you hear a phone? 
 - Yeah.

40:28.502 --> 40:31.338
Oh, wait. 
 Sounds like it's coming from here.

40:31.421 --> 40:34.758
- I don't have a phone. 
 - You do now. "Answer me."

40:34.800 --> 40:37.761
Oh, my God, so cool. 
 Is it your birthday or something?

40:39.554 --> 40:40.973
- Hello? 
 - Do you like the phone?

40:41.056 --> 40:43.934
I might, 
 if it comes with an explanation.

40:44.017 --> 40:45.727
It does, actually.

40:45.769 --> 40:47.688
I think I may have 
 real feelings for you.

40:47.771 --> 40:50.899
- It's Sebastian Valmont, isn't it? 
 -Just a second, okay?

40:50.983 --> 40:52.734
- Sorry. 
 - Not you. Her.

40:52.776 --> 40:55.571
- Who's her? 
 - Look, I can't do this from a phone.

40:55.612 --> 40:57.948
But it's a good phone. Digital.

40:57.990 --> 41:01.994
- Where are you? You can't be too far. 
 - Look down.

41:06.123 --> 41:09.501
Oh, it is Sebastian Valmont.

41:09.585 --> 41:12.087
Don't move. 
 I'm coming down there.

41:17.634 --> 41:19.553
- Move, Einstein. 
 - Hey!

41:19.636 --> 41:22.180
Where are you?

41:22.264 --> 41:24.182
- Close your eyes. 
 - Why?

41:24.266 --> 41:26.226
- Just trust me. Close your eyes. 
 - I'll look silly.

41:26.310 --> 41:28.520
Close them now.

41:36.987 --> 41:39.198
Danielle, wait!

41:45.454 --> 41:49.625
It's like they say: 
 The best laid plans sometimes suck.

42:00.344 --> 42:02.304
Miss Merteuil.

42:04.848 --> 42:08.810
- But I'm excused from gym. 
 - Gym, yes. Ballet, no.

42:10.020 --> 42:13.357
Well, there must be something 
 I can do to change your mind.

42:13.440 --> 42:17.361
I think you've got the wrong guy. 
 Now get your ass to ballet.

42:20.113 --> 42:22.032
Mr. Erwick.

42:24.201 --> 42:27.663
I was very clear. Keep me out of gym...

42:27.746 --> 42:31.124
- and ballet. 
 - I can't do anything, all right?

42:31.208 --> 42:34.336
Hargrove called me into his office. He's 
 suspicious, I heard it in his voice.

42:34.378 --> 42:37.464
- Why do you think that is? 
 - Well, I'm not sure.

42:37.547 --> 42:39.842
The Disciplinary Committee, of course.

42:39.883 --> 42:41.844
You stuttered and stammered 
 like a completely whipped fool...

42:41.885 --> 42:45.013
and then when you voted, it was obvious 
 you voted the way I wanted you to vote.

42:45.097 --> 42:49.893
But that's how you did want me to vote. 
 Oh, my God, I'm a mess.

42:49.977 --> 42:53.230
You're always one step ahead of me. 
 I don't know what to do anymore.

42:53.313 --> 42:55.273
It's a dirty old man's catch-22.

42:55.357 --> 42:57.526
Shut up, Steve. 
 Get control of yourself.

42:57.609 --> 43:00.153
I can't. 
 I'm falling apart.

43:00.237 --> 43:05.367
My wife doesn't turn me on anymore, 
 my kids hate me. I should just quit.

43:05.409 --> 43:08.328
Stop blubbering. 
 I'll go back to gym and ballet.

43:08.412 --> 43:12.541
- You will? 
 - The excuse slips were just a test.

43:12.583 --> 43:16.169
The day will come when I'll need you 
 for a favor-- a big favor--

43:16.253 --> 43:18.171
and you'll do it without question.

43:23.427 --> 43:26.596
Of course. 
 I worship you, Kathryn.

43:26.680 --> 43:29.016
Worship works best 
 on your knees, Steve.

43:34.104 --> 43:38.066
Please be quiet. I'm trying to imagine 
 I'm with someone attractive.

43:38.150 --> 43:39.651
Sorry.

43:44.281 --> 43:46.283
Hello!

43:46.325 --> 43:48.285
Anybody!

43:57.169 --> 43:59.212
Oh, my God, she is terrible.

44:00.130 --> 44:02.424
If it's so bad here, 
 why don't you guys just quit?

44:02.466 --> 44:04.551
It's steady employment, sir.

44:04.635 --> 44:07.387
This is a good address. 
 We could be down in the 50s!

44:07.471 --> 44:10.057
Or worse, Scarsdale.

44:10.140 --> 44:12.267
Ladies there make me crazy!

44:12.351 --> 44:15.687
All the time sending me to the market 
 looking for gefilte.

44:15.771 --> 44:18.649
My father-- 
 fisherman for 20 years--

44:18.732 --> 44:20.776
he never caught one gefilte.

44:20.817 --> 44:22.569
What is a gefilte?

44:23.820 --> 44:26.198
- Three kings. 
 - Man!

44:26.281 --> 44:28.283
- That beats my two pairs. 
 - I got crap.

44:28.367 --> 44:29.826
Full house, jacks over threes.

44:29.868 --> 44:31.828
You win again, Master Sebastian.

44:31.870 --> 44:35.123
You know, Henry, I really wish 
 you'd quit with the "master" thing.

44:35.165 --> 44:38.127
But sir, it's your title. 
 It shows privilege.

44:38.168 --> 44:39.795
Yeah, well, 
 what has it gotten me?

44:39.878 --> 44:42.381
I poured all my money into gifts 
 and didn't get the girl.

44:42.464 --> 44:46.385
Danielle hates my wealth 
 or resents it or something.

44:46.468 --> 44:48.762
Perhaps it's not my place 
 to speak, sir.

44:48.845 --> 44:50.806
No, Henry, please. 
 I'm desperate here.

44:51.765 --> 44:54.560
Well, maybe she doesn't want to feel 
 like she's being bought.

44:55.519 --> 44:59.147
- You think that's it? 
 - I don't know. Women are complicated.

45:00.023 --> 45:02.985
It's been my experience, sir, 
 that women are more interested...

45:03.026 --> 45:06.154
in the soul of a man 
 than in his trappings.

45:11.368 --> 45:13.870
What is going on around here?

45:13.912 --> 45:18.167
I had to ring and ring. 
 And where were you, Frederick?

45:18.208 --> 45:19.835
I paged you four times.

45:19.877 --> 45:22.587
I had to take a cab. 
 A cab!

45:22.671 --> 45:24.464
I'm sorry, we were just--

45:24.548 --> 45:27.509
Get out of here, 
 all of you.

45:27.593 --> 45:30.345
And you can be damned sure 
 my mother's gonna hear about this.

45:30.429 --> 45:33.390
- No, she won't. 
 - What did you say?

45:33.432 --> 45:35.726
You're not telling anybody 
 about this.

45:35.767 --> 45:38.353
This was my idea. 
 I ordered them to play cards.

45:38.437 --> 45:41.481
And to drink Mother's 
 prized 1939 Neufdu Pape?

45:41.565 --> 45:44.151
Great year. 
 Blitzkrieg, wasn't it?

45:44.234 --> 45:46.153
Don't get smart.

45:46.236 --> 45:49.198
Whether you realize it or not, 
 you are still a guest in this house.

45:49.281 --> 45:52.784
You know, you treat these people like 
 dirt. No wonder they don't respect you.

45:52.868 --> 45:58.123
We pay them for service, not respect. 
 Maybe someday you'll learn that.

45:58.207 --> 46:00.667
And one day you'll realize 
 that they're human beings.

46:04.880 --> 46:06.548
Just give me a second here.

46:08.091 --> 46:09.843
Party's over.

46:13.555 --> 46:16.308
You know, I don't get it.

46:19.353 --> 46:21.605
Look, if you hate your mother 
 so much...

46:21.688 --> 46:24.399
why work so hard 
 to be just like her?

46:24.441 --> 46:26.068
Is that what you think I'm doing?

46:26.151 --> 46:29.613
Well, you're obviously trying 
 to prove something to someone.

46:29.696 --> 46:32.116
No one's this mean, unless--

46:32.199 --> 46:34.743
unless there's a whole bunch 
 of pain and suffering behind it.

46:34.826 --> 46:38.121
You think you have it so tough, having 
 to come into this strange house...

46:38.205 --> 46:40.999
with strange people-- 
 try growing up here.

46:41.083 --> 46:46.004
Try spending every moment of your life 
 just making up for just being here.

46:46.088 --> 46:49.424
- That doesn't make any sense. 
 - No, it doesn't, does it?

46:49.466 --> 46:52.511
You feel out of place, Sebastian? 
 You want to fit in?

46:52.594 --> 46:54.221
Guess what. So do I.

47:03.147 --> 47:04.606
What a mess.

47:07.567 --> 47:09.987
- Hello. 
 - Sebastian? It's Cherie.

47:10.028 --> 47:13.615
News flash. Danielle is 
 totally, madly in love with you.

47:13.657 --> 47:15.784
Madly in love with me? 
 She hates me.

47:15.867 --> 47:19.204
- Every move I make is the wrong move. 
 - Yeah, but she told me stuff..

47:19.288 --> 47:23.709
Every time she thinks about you, every 
 time she sees you, she gets all moist.

47:23.792 --> 47:25.460
" Moist"?

47:25.544 --> 47:27.629
Her eyes-- 
 she gets tears in them.

47:29.006 --> 47:31.800
But look, time's running out. 
 You gotta move now.

47:31.842 --> 47:35.971
She'll be in the city tonight-- dinner 
 with her favorite aunt, Riverside Cafe.

47:37.848 --> 47:40.726
I figure if you go there, 
 bare your soul--

47:40.809 --> 47:44.938
No gifts though. 
 She hates that money thing. Hello?

48:04.875 --> 48:07.127
Closet street performer.

48:07.210 --> 48:08.670
Now you know all my secrets.

48:08.712 --> 48:11.131
How did you know I was here?

48:11.215 --> 48:15.427
Nope. Already know. 
 Cherie the blabbermouth.

48:15.511 --> 48:18.680
Weird girl, but if you get beyond 
 all the "totallys" and "oh, my Gods"...

48:18.722 --> 48:20.474
there's real truth there.

48:20.557 --> 48:22.476
- I have to catch my train. 
 - Let me come with.

48:22.559 --> 48:24.311
I'll make sure 
 you get home all right.

48:24.394 --> 48:28.357
You can come as far as the station and 
 only if you can do it without talking.

48:28.440 --> 48:31.818
Not another word-- 
 that's my condition.

48:31.902 --> 48:33.612
Condition accepted.

48:39.076 --> 48:44.206
All right, all right! Stop! I give up, 
 okay? We can talk. Stop playing.

48:44.289 --> 48:47.960
You know, I think this is 
 the most romantic city on earth--

48:48.043 --> 48:52.839
millions of strangers meeting 
 in restaurants, parks, sidewalks--

48:52.923 --> 48:57.052
a romance born every five seconds, 
 every heartbeat.

48:57.094 --> 48:59.304
I mean, God, 
 is this a great city or what?

48:59.388 --> 49:03.767
This is exactly what I'm talking about. 
 You spout BS on a continuous basis.

49:03.850 --> 49:05.352
Only because I can't say 
 what I really want to say.

49:05.435 --> 49:08.897
- Say it! 
 - Okay.

49:08.939 --> 49:12.359
I wanna know what happened 
 at school, in the courtyard.

49:12.442 --> 49:14.361
I kissed you, 
 and you just ran off.

49:16.113 --> 49:20.409
I'm crazy about you! I'm trying 
 everything I can to make you like me.

49:20.450 --> 49:23.662
Be yourself. Be honest. 
 Why is that so difficult?

49:24.955 --> 49:28.208
I don't know. 
 Maybe I'm scared.

49:30.460 --> 49:33.880
You know, I'm new here, right? 
 New to this city...

49:33.964 --> 49:35.591
new at school...

49:35.674 --> 49:38.385
living in a house full 
 of certifiable wackos...

49:38.469 --> 49:40.387
and I don't have any friends...

49:40.470 --> 49:43.432
at least, any I can trust.

49:43.515 --> 49:45.559
And I'm confused.

49:45.642 --> 49:48.979
God's honest truth, 
 I'm in a state of perpetual confusion.

49:50.647 --> 49:52.274
So what are you scared of?

49:52.357 --> 49:57.112
Missing my train. 
 See you at school. Bye.

50:09.833 --> 50:12.461
As you know, 
 your mother gets home tonight.

50:12.502 --> 50:15.505
And you want me to keep quiet 
 about the poker game.

50:15.589 --> 50:18.842
I don't like these ideas 
 Sebastian's putting in your head.

50:18.926 --> 50:21.470
- I mean no disrespect. 
 - Well, I'm offended.

50:21.512 --> 50:24.514
Leave. 
 I'll finish alone.

50:27.559 --> 50:29.144
Min Lin, wait.

50:29.228 --> 50:32.731
Why don't you and I get to know each 
 other, like with Sebastian last night?

50:32.814 --> 50:36.151
- Do I have to? 
 - Come on, it'll be fun.

50:36.193 --> 50:38.111
Here.

50:43.033 --> 50:46.161
I'll jump right in. 
 Where are you from-- China, Japan?

50:46.203 --> 50:47.788
Cambodia actually.

50:47.871 --> 50:51.917
Cambodia-- wonderful country. And when 
 did you come to our United States?

50:52.000 --> 50:54.294
My family fled through Vietnam.

50:54.378 --> 50:58.924
Ultimately, we were 1 20 crammed 
 into a boat the size of your pantry.

50:59.007 --> 51:03.470
Oh, my gosh, that reminds me of this 
 time in Denver, coming home from Aspen.

51:03.554 --> 51:06.848
The first-class lounge was packed. 
 We almost had to fly coach.

51:08.600 --> 51:11.645
Anyway, so your family fled 
 the Khmer Rouge?

51:12.896 --> 51:16.358
Nothing subtle 
 about that shade of rouge.

51:18.610 --> 51:20.612
See? We do have a lot in common.

51:21.822 --> 51:23.740
Will there be anything else, 
 Miss Kathryn?

51:24.741 --> 51:26.618
No, that's all.

51:29.746 --> 51:31.248
I'm glad we did this, 
 aren't you?

51:32.249 --> 51:34.918
Oh, yes. 
 Very enlightening.

51:37.587 --> 51:38.714
Bitch.

51:43.594 --> 51:45.721
You got all your pronouns mixed up.

51:45.762 --> 51:48.724
"Nous " is "we." 
 "Vous " is "you."

51:49.766 --> 51:52.936
Unless it's someone 
 you're crazy, madly in love with...

51:53.020 --> 51:56.565
in which case it's "tu, " 
 as in you and Sebastian.

51:56.606 --> 51:58.650
I swear, that thing 
 with the phone-- so cool.

51:58.734 --> 52:00.319
I mean, if it had been 
 me and some guy--

52:00.402 --> 52:02.279
I would have piddled 
 right there on the spot.

52:02.321 --> 52:04.323
Oh, wait, 
 did I show you my doodle?

52:04.406 --> 52:06.950
- Excuse me? 
 - My doodle, my sketch.

52:11.788 --> 52:13.582
Wow.

52:13.624 --> 52:16.918
- You've got some talent, Cherie. 
 -Just tell me:

52:16.960 --> 52:19.421
I mean, do you really like him? 
 Is this it?

52:19.463 --> 52:22.049
- Is it the real thing? 
 - Like I even know what that is.

52:22.132 --> 52:24.301
Knees go weak, mouth goes dry...

52:24.384 --> 52:27.429
you get that little tingling feeling 
 in that special place.

52:29.681 --> 52:32.809
He's just so slick, 
 so sure of himself.

52:32.893 --> 52:34.853
I have a lot of trouble 
 trusting him.

52:34.937 --> 52:37.731
He can't just come out and talk to me, 
 say what he's really feeling...

52:37.814 --> 52:39.775
and neither can I.

52:41.276 --> 52:43.278
Okay, chapter three.

52:43.320 --> 52:46.281
Read the translation 
 of the first passage.

52:47.282 --> 52:52.788
" Love is a sublime melting pot in which 
 men and women are fused together.

52:52.871 --> 52:57.334
The lover is a priest, the ravished 
 virgin a trembling sacrifice."

52:57.376 --> 53:00.128
A priest and a virgin?

53:00.170 --> 53:02.297
That's sick!

53:07.886 --> 53:11.014
Move. Move.

53:16.687 --> 53:20.774
- Hi, Mr. Nagao! 
 - Hello, ladies!

53:20.857 --> 53:24.319
I make a special 
 eel and cuke roll today.

53:28.323 --> 53:30.909
It's so sad about Mr. Washington.

53:30.993 --> 53:34.663
I mean, the fact that they found 
 a dead rat in that student's sloppy Joe.

53:36.540 --> 53:38.459
He'll never work again.

53:40.168 --> 53:42.629
So, you never told us 
 how it went with Cherie.

53:42.713 --> 53:46.842
- Did you bury her? 
 - Let's say she's on her way to ruin.

53:49.219 --> 53:52.347
- Everything's set for this weekend. 
 - What are you talking about?

53:52.389 --> 53:55.350
Uh, duh. 
 I told my mom how much fun we had...

53:55.392 --> 53:58.353
and she invited you and your mom over 
 for nonfat lattes.

53:58.395 --> 54:00.772
Your mom told my mom 
 that you can sleep over.

54:00.856 --> 54:04.359
I got the new Hanson album! 
 Okay, I gotta go.

54:04.443 --> 54:08.530
Gordon Anderson promised he'd show me 
 his one-eyed snake, whatever that is.

54:09.740 --> 54:11.366
Okay, see you.

54:13.410 --> 54:16.205
Wow, Kathryn, 
 you really showed her.

54:26.423 --> 54:29.968
Don't talk. Don't say a word.

54:30.052 --> 54:31.970
It's my turn to explain.

54:33.597 --> 54:37.935
All I've done is hound you 
 about being honest...

54:37.976 --> 54:41.271
when I couldn't do it myself.

54:41.355 --> 54:45.776
That kiss in the courtyard, Sebastian-- 
 it was more than just a kiss.

54:46.985 --> 54:49.530
- I'll say. 
 - No, let me finish.

54:49.613 --> 54:52.491
You see...

54:52.574 --> 54:55.285
it was my first kiss.

54:55.369 --> 54:58.747
I wanted it to be perfect 
 and right and with the right boy...

54:58.789 --> 55:01.917
and, while you might have been the right 
 boy, the rest was totally not right.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.919
I embarrassed you.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.963
I embarrassed myself.

55:06.004 --> 55:09.007
Because I know you're used to girls 
 with all this experience...

55:09.091 --> 55:11.426
and you've probably been 
 kissing girls forever...

55:11.468 --> 55:13.595
and that's what I was 
 afraid to tell you.

55:18.684 --> 55:20.769
I happen to think 
 this is wonderful, all right?

55:20.811 --> 55:24.272
So you weren't exactly 
 up-front and honest. Join the club.

55:24.356 --> 55:26.024
I wanted it to be perfect...

55:26.775 --> 55:29.945
not the tail end of some prank.

55:29.987 --> 55:32.364
Does that make any sense?

55:32.447 --> 55:33.699
Yeah.

55:35.033 --> 55:37.703
You know, some things can't 
 be orchestrated.

55:37.786 --> 55:42.207
Some things have to be 
 spontaneous, like a kiss.

55:42.291 --> 55:44.585
Like the kiss we're 
 about to have right now.

55:55.846 --> 55:57.806
Say something, quick.

55:58.515 --> 56:00.017
I can't.

56:00.893 --> 56:03.479
I have to go. Last bell.

56:06.690 --> 56:08.567
Okay, but...

56:08.650 --> 56:13.447
just back away 
 so I know you're not running away.

56:27.377 --> 56:29.755
That was wonderful--

56:29.838 --> 56:32.007
just precious.

56:32.049 --> 56:33.800
How long were you there?

56:35.093 --> 56:38.180
"I've never kissed a boy before-- 
 I mean, the right boy...

56:38.221 --> 56:41.683
and you've probably been 
 kissing girls forever."

56:41.725 --> 56:45.687
You must feel like a terrible dope, 
 leading on that poor, lovesick girl.

56:45.771 --> 56:47.939
You don't know 
 what you're talking about.

56:48.023 --> 56:51.777
Here's a prediction: A few weeks 
 of hand-holding and chaste smooching...

56:51.860 --> 56:54.530
and you'll be so bored and horny 
 you'll mess the whole thing up.

56:54.571 --> 56:57.908
Of course, I could 
 wipe her off the map tomorrow....

56:57.991 --> 57:01.495
but I think I'll let this little romance 
 just flicker out all on its own.

57:01.578 --> 57:05.332
I like the girl, okay? I like her a lot. 
 You screw it up, and I'll screw you up.

57:05.415 --> 57:07.876
Nobody ever threatens me.

57:09.252 --> 57:11.630
I just did-- 
 or weren't you listening?

57:14.091 --> 57:18.053
- You do realize this means war. 
 - Then war it is.

57:25.018 --> 57:26.895
Lovely.

57:32.985 --> 57:35.112
Well, I feel badly for you, 
 I really do...

57:35.195 --> 57:38.949
but Byron needs to be groomed 
 every day at 3:00.

57:39.032 --> 57:41.618
Well, you'll just have to reschedule 
 your daughter's birthday.

57:41.702 --> 57:44.413
Now, I want him saddled 
 and ready to ride when I arrive.

57:44.496 --> 57:47.457
Don't keep me waiting. 
 Idiot!

57:49.126 --> 57:51.753
There's a new student at Manchester-- 
 Cherie Clayman.

57:52.504 --> 57:53.755
Did she die?

57:53.797 --> 57:57.259
- I take it you don't like her. 
 - I can't stand her.

57:57.301 --> 58:01.680
She's actually very sweet, 
 so I'm turning her into the school slut.

58:01.763 --> 58:04.141
- Well, she's now your new best friend. 
 - Why?

58:05.434 --> 58:09.521
You're not hitting up the Claymans 
 for a donation to Manchester.

58:12.024 --> 58:14.693
Sorry, Mother. 
 I think it's an excellent idea.

58:14.776 --> 58:19.531
- The Claymans will join us at 7:00. 
 - You invited them here?

58:19.615 --> 58:21.742
Mother, they're from California.

58:21.825 --> 58:23.619
Kathryn, I need this.

58:23.702 --> 58:27.956
Just 20 million more and we can break 
 ground on the Tiffany Merteuil Library.

58:32.669 --> 58:35.923
Well, you ladies seem to be 
 enjoying yourselves.

58:36.006 --> 58:38.425
You must be tense, Sebastian.

58:38.509 --> 58:40.636
Yeah, well, you'd be too 
 if you were failing gym.

58:40.677 --> 58:43.263
I mean, who ever heard of fencing 
 as a sport?

58:43.347 --> 58:45.974
Perhaps a massage would help.

58:47.684 --> 58:49.645
I've never had a massage before.

58:50.687 --> 58:53.815
You can have my table. 
 I'm suddenly not in the mood.

58:54.858 --> 58:57.653
"Mycket, " not "myckesh. "

58:57.736 --> 59:00.405
Kathryn, if you're not going to say it 
 correctly, don't say it at all.

59:00.489 --> 59:02.991
It just makes you look foolish.

59:03.075 --> 59:05.202
Thank you 
 for the correction, Mother.

59:08.539 --> 59:10.123
Now, if you'll excuse me.

59:14.044 --> 59:16.004
I think I could get used to this.

59:19.174 --> 59:20.259
Hi.

59:22.177 --> 59:24.846
Dead puppies, 
 dead puppies, dead puppies...

59:24.930 --> 59:27.182
old nuns in their underwear--

59:35.565 --> 59:37.693
I thought you'd left.

59:37.776 --> 59:40.362
- Is that Sonja or Ingrid? 
 - It's Tiffany.

59:40.445 --> 59:44.032
- I hope you enjoyed your massage. 
 - I think I'll go take a shower.

59:44.908 --> 59:48.120
We've had so little time together, 
 Sebastian.

59:48.203 --> 59:51.748
We can't be a happy family if we don't 
 get to know each other a little better.

59:51.832 --> 59:56.295
You're right, Mom. 
 We should talk more, Mom.

59:56.378 --> 59:59.631
With your father working on the yacht so 
 much, I'll have plenty of time for you.

01:00:00.716 --> 01:00:02.885
You know, some nights 
 he doesn't even come home.

01:00:04.595 --> 01:00:06.555
He loves that yacht.

01:00:06.638 --> 01:00:08.849
I'm glad he found something 
 he's so committed to.

01:00:09.892 --> 01:00:12.394
Well, the right woman will do that.

01:00:12.436 --> 01:00:16.398
- And you think I'm the right woman? 
 - Definitely. He's a changed man.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:21.570
Of course. Without me he'd still be 
 in Miami giving charters to geriatrics.

01:00:21.653 --> 01:00:24.740
It's not the money, it's you. 
 He loves you.

01:00:24.782 --> 01:00:28.994
You're a smart boy, Sebastian. You seem 
 to understand your father very well.

01:00:29.077 --> 01:00:30.746
I hope so.

01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:36.335
So do I, because if you're wrong, you're 
 both going to end up out on the street.

01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:42.049
She spanked me.

01:00:45.552 --> 01:00:50.015
- Oh, baby. Oh, that feels so good. 
 - Oh, yeah, you like that, huh?

01:00:50.098 --> 01:00:53.519
- Dad, you here? 
 - Fuck! Fuck!

01:01:01.777 --> 01:01:04.404
Hey, son, how's it goin'?

01:01:04.488 --> 01:01:07.116
- In bed already? 
 - Oh, it's just a catnap.

01:01:11.036 --> 01:01:12.579
What are you doing?

01:01:12.663 --> 01:01:17.126
Oh, I'm just looking for the cat.

01:01:17.167 --> 01:01:20.087
Here, puss, puss, 
 puss, puss, puss.

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:22.547
I hope you're not suggesting 
 I'm having an affair.

01:01:22.631 --> 01:01:25.634
- I'm not suggesting anything. 
 - I'm your father...

01:01:25.676 --> 01:01:27.886
and I will not be treated 
 like a criminal!

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:30.806
Criminal.

01:01:35.352 --> 01:01:37.646
You could have fooled me.

01:01:37.688 --> 01:01:40.607
And behind door number three 
 we have--

01:01:43.193 --> 01:01:46.488
- Hello. 
 - Sebastian, meet Lilly...

01:01:46.572 --> 01:01:49.408
my first mate.

01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:52.244
Lilly, I'm Sebastian, 
 Edward's son.

01:01:53.745 --> 01:01:58.750
Oh, my God, you have your father's eyes. 
 Are you a Libra?

01:01:58.834 --> 01:02:01.169
Let's just cut right to the chase, 
 shall we?

01:02:01.211 --> 01:02:04.006
He offered to sail you 
 around the world, didn't he?

01:02:04.089 --> 01:02:05.549
How did you know?

01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:08.343
Leave right now, 
 or you're grounded for a week.

01:02:08.427 --> 01:02:11.972
- Did he tell you he's married? 
 - I was waiting for the right time.

01:02:13.015 --> 01:02:14.892
You lied to me?

01:02:14.933 --> 01:02:17.352
More an error of omission. 
 You see, she's very sick.

01:02:17.394 --> 01:02:20.606
I may be single any day now.

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:23.108
Go to hell!

01:02:25.527 --> 01:02:29.114
Sebastian, you think you could 
 help me out here?

01:02:32.034 --> 01:02:35.162
Okay, okay, 
 I know we talked about this...

01:02:35.245 --> 01:02:37.748
but you're a man, 
 and you have to understand--

01:02:38.707 --> 01:02:40.501
You have to understand.

01:02:40.584 --> 01:02:44.504
It's not just your life anymore, Dad, 
 it's mine too. Don't screw it up for me.

01:02:44.588 --> 01:02:49.676
Absolutely. You can count on me, son. 
 The keys, please?

01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:56.391
You know, you made your bed. 
 Now lie in it.

01:03:06.777 --> 01:03:10.072
Well, this sucks.

01:03:14.159 --> 01:03:17.621
I can't believe I was so stupid.

01:03:17.704 --> 01:03:20.207
I really thought your dad liked me.

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:21.917
It's not your fault.

01:03:21.959 --> 01:03:26.380
He's the master of deceit. He should be 
 in the Pathological Liars' Hall of Fame.

01:03:26.463 --> 01:03:28.924
He was in the Hall of Fame?

01:03:29.007 --> 01:03:31.260
- Never mind. 
 - Can I ask you something?

01:03:31.301 --> 01:03:33.929
- Sure. 
 - Why are men such jerks?

01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:36.348
I mean, is it genetic or something?

01:03:36.431 --> 01:03:40.018
You know, they promise you the world, 
 that you're the one for them...

01:03:40.102 --> 01:03:43.564
and that their wives 
 don't understand them anymore.

01:03:43.647 --> 01:03:46.191
And I fall for it every time.

01:03:47.276 --> 01:03:50.654
I'm like a doormat. 
 They're always coming and going...

01:03:50.696 --> 01:03:54.199
and coming and going, 
 and coming and--

01:03:54.283 --> 01:03:56.618
My life sucks.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:00.747
Lilly, you don't need a man 
 to be happy.

01:04:00.831 --> 01:04:04.251
If you're not happy alone, you're 
 not gonna be happy with someone else.

01:04:04.334 --> 01:04:07.879
You're a very attractive woman. 
 You could have anyone you want.

01:04:07.963 --> 01:04:10.132
You just have to wait 
 for the right guy to come along.

01:04:12.176 --> 01:04:16.054
- You think I'm attractive? 
 - I think you're beautiful.

01:04:16.138 --> 01:04:18.348
You're so sincere.

01:04:18.432 --> 01:04:20.934
You're not like your father at all.

01:04:25.189 --> 01:04:29.484
Okay. 
 Glad you were paying attention.

01:04:29.526 --> 01:04:31.820
Do you wanna 
 come back to my place?

01:04:31.904 --> 01:04:35.657
I'd love to, but I have 
 an oral report due in the morning.

01:04:35.699 --> 01:04:37.701
Oh, I'm great at orals.

01:04:37.743 --> 01:04:39.661
- Yeah. 
 - Try me.

01:04:39.703 --> 01:04:41.496
No, thank you.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:43.665
Listen, I'm gonna split. 
 Are you gonna be okay?

01:04:43.707 --> 01:04:45.459
Yeah, I'll be fine.

01:04:48.211 --> 01:04:49.338
Psycho.

01:04:57.095 --> 01:05:00.557
I lived in Fresnomy whole life. 
 Les too.

01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:02.768
But we wanted more for Cherie, 
 so when Les sold the biz...

01:05:02.851 --> 01:05:05.729
we decided to move 
 to the Big Apple.

01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:07.356
And how are you finding Manchester?

01:05:07.397 --> 01:05:11.026
Oh, it's no problem. 
 Our driver-- he takes me right there.

01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:13.820
She's asking you 
 if you like it, honey.

01:05:13.904 --> 01:05:17.366
Oh, yeah, it's the best. 
 And Kathryn's been, like, so super-nice.

01:05:17.407 --> 01:05:19.409
You know, some girls-- 
 they told me to stay away from her...

01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:22.120
like she had 
 permanent PMS or something.

01:05:22.204 --> 01:05:24.998
Ew, gross! But she's been, 
 like, totally awesome!

01:05:26.708 --> 01:05:29.044
I can tell she's going to be 
 very popular.

01:05:29.086 --> 01:05:32.339
- Oh, I won't be as popular as you. 
 - " Popular" is such a bore.

01:05:32.422 --> 01:05:36.343
The important thing is school spirit, 
 and nobody has as much as my mother.

01:05:36.426 --> 01:05:39.262
I do a little work 
 for the school fund-raising committee.

01:05:39.304 --> 01:05:40.931
You are so modest.

01:05:41.014 --> 01:05:44.560
Mother's already raised half the money 
 needed for the new school library.

01:05:44.643 --> 01:05:46.728
How much money have you raised?

01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:50.524
Well, she barely has to do anything. 
 The parents practically throw it at her.

01:05:51.483 --> 01:05:53.569
Why do they throw money at you?

01:05:53.652 --> 01:05:57.364
Because charity is smiled upon 
 by the ladies who lunch.

01:05:57.447 --> 01:06:00.409
Society, Cherie. 
 You know-- the social ladder?

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:02.828
Oh, yeah. My mom said 
 now that we're rich...

01:06:02.911 --> 01:06:04.913
we gotta start climbing that thing.

01:06:04.997 --> 01:06:08.667
- Ow! What? 
 - Isn't she precious?

01:06:18.635 --> 01:06:22.014
- Would you excuse me? Pardon me. 
 - Certainly.

01:06:24.308 --> 01:06:27.102
So, how much money do you need?

01:06:27.144 --> 01:06:30.897
Oh, I didn't invite you over here 
 to discuss fund-raising, Bunny...

01:06:32.316 --> 01:06:35.861
but if you'd care to make a donation, 
 we'd certainly consider it.

01:06:35.944 --> 01:06:39.698
Really? Why, thank you.

01:06:39.782 --> 01:06:41.616
My pleasure.

01:06:47.039 --> 01:06:50.292
Oh, hi, honey. How was your day? 
 I can explain this.

01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:54.463
There's no need to explain. 
 I know you love my mother very much.

01:06:54.546 --> 01:06:55.714
Yes. Exactly.

01:06:55.797 --> 01:06:58.967
And Sebastian and I are 
 just getting close.

01:06:59.051 --> 01:07:02.637
I know you'd never do anything 
 to break up our happy home.

01:07:02.679 --> 01:07:05.891
- Oh, no, never. 
 - So let's make sure it stays happy.

01:07:05.974 --> 01:07:08.352
I want you to take Mother to dinner 
 at Au Troquet for dinner tomorrow night.

01:07:08.393 --> 01:07:12.356
I'll make reservations at 8:00. At 8:45, 
 an accordion player will pass by.

01:07:12.397 --> 01:07:14.983
When he does, request 
 " Under My Thumb" by the Rolling Stones.

01:07:15.067 --> 01:07:17.027
Mick Jagger makes Mother 
 all hot and bothered.

01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:18.737
-Jagger. Got it. 
 - While she's listening...

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:22.950
slip this on her finger, then kiss her-- 
 eight seconds, no tongue.

01:07:23.033 --> 01:07:25.869
Are you getting all this? 
 After dinner, grappa-- one glass--

01:07:25.953 --> 01:07:30.165
then bring her home, make love to her-- 
 two Viagra-- any questions?

01:07:30.249 --> 01:07:33.669
Just in case, 
 I've written it all down for you.

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:36.004
Now, who's your favorite daughter?

01:07:36.046 --> 01:07:37.339
You are.

01:07:45.305 --> 01:07:47.516
What a shame.

01:08:04.116 --> 01:08:05.701
Morning!

01:08:07.452 --> 01:08:08.829
Great day, isn't it?

01:08:08.912 --> 01:08:13.125
Bite me, rich boy!

01:08:14.585 --> 01:08:18.087
Ah, New York-- 
 a wonderful town.

01:08:19.756 --> 01:08:22.885
- You look fabulous. 
 - Thank you.

01:08:22.968 --> 01:08:25.261
- You got everything? You all set? 
 - Yeah.

01:08:25.345 --> 01:08:30.058
You ought to take some money, just 
 in case you need a cab, miss the train--

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:33.854
- Don't worry, Dad. I'll be fine. 
 - Come on, this is my job-- to worry.

01:08:37.608 --> 01:08:42.404
- What's wrong? 
 - Nothing. Just thought about your mom.

01:08:42.446 --> 01:08:44.573
- Go on. Have a good time. 
 - Okay.

01:08:44.615 --> 01:08:47.158
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

01:08:51.287 --> 01:08:53.665
Sebastian thought you'd like it 
 better than the train.

01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:55.626
Wow.

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:58.337
I am so excited. 
 You know, I'm kind of nervous.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:01.215
- I've never been on a horse before. 
 - Don't worry.

01:09:01.298 --> 01:09:03.801
I won't let anything bad 
 happen to you.

01:09:03.884 --> 01:09:06.053
If I like it, 
 then I'll have Daddy buy me a horse...

01:09:06.136 --> 01:09:08.471
then we can spend 
 every weekend together.

01:09:08.555 --> 01:09:10.682
You'll love it. I promise.

01:09:17.104 --> 01:09:18.982
Very good, Cherie.

01:09:19.066 --> 01:09:22.778
Back on the horse now. I think 
 we're ready to try advanced jumping.

01:09:22.861 --> 01:09:26.782
I don't know. 
 He keeps throwing me off.

01:09:27.741 --> 01:09:30.827
All right. 
 If you're going to be a scaredy-cat...

01:09:30.911 --> 01:09:35.957
I guess we'd better 
 go back to the basics-- Manuela?

01:09:40.295 --> 01:09:42.464
Nice horsey.

01:09:46.385 --> 01:09:49.638
Okay. Now, using the stirrups...

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.809
I want you to push up and down 
 in the saddle-- that's called posting.

01:09:53.892 --> 01:09:56.353
Now we need to add 
 the back and forth motion.

01:09:56.395 --> 01:10:00.190
When you hit the saddle, 
 push backward, then forward.

01:10:00.274 --> 01:10:04.903
Up and down, back and forth, 
 faster, faster.

01:10:04.987 --> 01:10:09.825
Up and down, back and forth, 
 faster, faster.

01:10:26.884 --> 01:10:30.512
Good. This time I want you 
 to really grind into the saddle.

01:10:30.554 --> 01:10:33.265
- Okay. 
 - Up and down, back and forth...

01:10:33.348 --> 01:10:35.726
faster, faster.

01:10:39.771 --> 01:10:41.106
- How does that feel? 
 - Okay.

01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:46.570
Up and down. 
 I think I'm getting it.

01:10:46.612 --> 01:10:49.698
- Posting is fun. 
 - Faster, faster.

01:10:52.909 --> 01:10:55.454
Really fun.

01:11:03.378 --> 01:11:04.963
Are you okay?

01:11:07.633 --> 01:11:09.301
I've never felt better.

01:11:10.552 --> 01:11:12.554
Now I know why girls like horses.

01:11:24.566 --> 01:11:25.859
Wait.

01:11:27.236 --> 01:11:29.154
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

01:11:31.448 --> 01:11:34.326
- It's cool. 
 - I'm sorry.

01:11:35.118 --> 01:11:37.746
It's just that yesterday was 
 my first kiss...

01:11:37.788 --> 01:11:40.499
and now you're practically 
 touching my breast.

01:11:40.582 --> 01:11:42.876
At this rate, your dick will be 
 in my mouth by lunch.

01:11:44.253 --> 01:11:45.838
Anyone for lunch?

01:11:45.921 --> 01:11:48.090
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:11:48.173 --> 01:11:51.427
Listen, Danielle, we can take this 
 as slow as you want.

01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:54.221
I like you. 
 I've no need to rush things.

01:11:54.304 --> 01:11:57.849
That's not my problem. 
 I want to rush things.

01:11:57.933 --> 01:12:01.645
I'm tired of being the only virgin 
 in the sophomore class at Manchester.

01:12:01.728 --> 01:12:06.233
Are you telling me that everyone 
 in the sophomore class has done it?

01:12:06.316 --> 01:12:09.737
Well, it sure feels like it.

01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:14.450
I don't know. Ever feel 
 like you're at war with yourself?

01:12:15.325 --> 01:12:18.370
- Constantly. 
 - I mean, there's one side of me...

01:12:18.453 --> 01:12:23.750
that wants you to throw me down 
 right here and rip my clothes off.

01:12:23.834 --> 01:12:29.089
Then there's this other side of me that 
 thinks I should wait till I'm married.

01:12:29.173 --> 01:12:31.300
Which side should I choose, 
 Sebastian?

01:12:31.341 --> 01:12:33.135
You really want me to answer that?

01:12:33.218 --> 01:12:35.429
Come on, be my friend.

01:12:35.512 --> 01:12:38.056
Listen, Danielle...

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.017
I know exactly 
 what you're going through.

01:12:40.058 --> 01:12:43.061
We all have two sides. 
 I struggle with my dark side every day.

01:12:43.145 --> 01:12:45.772
But that was the old me.

01:12:45.856 --> 01:12:49.026
Believe it or not, 
 I have you to thank for it.

01:12:49.109 --> 01:12:52.029
You showed me that it was okay 
 to be a decent person.

01:12:52.112 --> 01:12:54.156
How dark was your past?

01:12:55.324 --> 01:12:56.908
Pitch black.

01:12:59.161 --> 01:13:01.079
I'm thinking--

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.918
I think 
 I'm falling in love with you.

01:13:06.001 --> 01:13:08.128
But I'm afraid to take the chance 
 to get hurt.

01:13:08.212 --> 01:13:12.925
- I'm afraid of getting hurt too. 
 - Listen, let's make a pact.

01:13:13.008 --> 01:13:16.512
We'll take it slow, 
 and we won't hurt each other.

01:13:18.388 --> 01:13:20.891
God, we sound like 
 a cancelled television series.

01:13:31.401 --> 01:13:33.028
You don't have to do this.

01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:35.698
I want to.

01:13:39.743 --> 01:13:41.870
Hello?

01:13:41.953 --> 01:13:44.706
Hi, Daddy. 
 I know, I'm running late.

01:13:44.748 --> 01:13:47.709
Tell Aunt Gloria we can 
 still make the 2:00 mass.

01:13:47.751 --> 01:13:51.505
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there. 
 I love you too.

01:13:53.424 --> 01:13:56.552
- You gotta go? It's okay. 
 - Sorry. Call me later?

01:13:56.593 --> 01:13:59.846
- Sure. 
 - Okay.

01:14:01.973 --> 01:14:04.101
- Toodles. 
 - Bye-bye.

01:14:06.061 --> 01:14:08.272
Oh, my balls.

01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:26.081
- Here's something you might like. 
 - Dolce.

01:14:26.164 --> 01:14:29.376
How '98 of you. 
 Do you carry any real fur?

01:14:29.459 --> 01:14:31.795
No, all of our fur is faux.

01:14:31.879 --> 01:14:35.507
Of course. 
 The animals-- how silly of me.

01:14:36.467 --> 01:14:37.718
I figured you'd be here.

01:14:37.801 --> 01:14:40.262
- What's up? 
 - It's about Sebastian.

01:14:40.345 --> 01:14:42.097
Give me the dirt.

01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:44.725
Your stepbrother has 
 quite the checkered past.

01:14:44.808 --> 01:14:48.186
I mean, the fact that he was able to 
 pay off that overnight delivery guy...

01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:50.564
and switch his school file?

01:14:50.647 --> 01:14:52.900
That's impressive 
 even by my standards.

01:14:52.983 --> 01:14:56.028
- That's just the tip of the iceberg. 
 - Well done.

01:14:56.111 --> 01:14:57.613
Cash or charge?

01:15:11.043 --> 01:15:13.295
- I'll be there in an hour. 
 - Sounds great.

01:15:13.378 --> 01:15:15.297
The new James Van Der Beek film's 
 playing in town.

01:15:15.339 --> 01:15:17.841
Perfect. 
 You're sure your dad won't mind?

01:15:17.883 --> 01:15:21.720
No, he's out of town for the night. 
 It's just me and Mr. Whiskers.

01:15:21.804 --> 01:15:26.975
- " Mr. Whiskers"? 
 - My pussy, silly.

01:15:27.017 --> 01:15:30.062
Okay, well, I'll see you soon. 
 All right. Bye.

01:15:32.147 --> 01:15:36.568
The school virgin's home alone with her 
 pussy, and I'm taking her to see Dawson.

01:15:36.652 --> 01:15:39.363
God, I've become a total fag.

01:15:43.867 --> 01:15:47.579
- I guess I misjudged you. 
 - What are you talking about?

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:53.001
How'd you get this?

01:15:53.043 --> 01:15:55.462
I have my ways.

01:15:55.546 --> 01:16:00.384
- Kathryn, I'm trying to start over-- 
 - Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, please.

01:16:00.426 --> 01:16:03.929
Spare me any sob stories.

01:16:04.012 --> 01:16:06.181
Oh, dear. 
 I guess something like this...

01:16:06.223 --> 01:16:10.185
could destroy your 
 squeaky-clean reputation at Manchester.

01:16:10.227 --> 01:16:14.731
And that school psychologist's report 
 about your mom-- it's too bad.

01:16:14.815 --> 01:16:17.985
How will she pay for rehab when I tell 
 Mommy where some of her money's going?

01:16:18.068 --> 01:16:21.405
- You're playing with fire, Kathryn. 
 - Poor Sebastian's mom is going to be...

01:16:21.488 --> 01:16:23.866
homeless and eating leftovers 
 out of the garbage.

01:16:23.907 --> 01:16:25.992
You don't know what I'm capable of.

01:16:26.076 --> 01:16:28.537
Yes, I do.

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:30.789
I read your file.

01:16:30.872 --> 01:16:33.667
It turns me on.

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:35.711
- Fuck off. 
 - Going to see Danielle?

01:16:35.794 --> 01:16:38.046
Leave her out of it!

01:16:39.798 --> 01:16:43.677
Looks like we've hit 
 a sensitive spot.

01:16:43.761 --> 01:16:47.389
Do you really think 
 you can change, Sebastian?

01:16:47.431 --> 01:16:51.977
Face it: 
 You and I are two of a kind.

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:54.730
We're just not cut out 
 for good deeds.

01:16:56.148 --> 01:16:58.150
I know the drill.

01:16:58.233 --> 01:17:00.068
You'll date Danielle...

01:17:00.152 --> 01:17:05.074
probably sleep with her after-- 
 what--you think eight months?

01:17:05.115 --> 01:17:09.369
And then you'll get bored, 
 and you'll break her heart.

01:17:09.453 --> 01:17:11.913
Why don't you 
 just spare her the pain?

01:17:11.997 --> 01:17:14.249
And do what? 
 Date you?

01:17:14.333 --> 01:17:16.835
We could make a good team.

01:17:18.962 --> 01:17:22.007
What do you plan on doing 
 with my file?

01:17:22.091 --> 01:17:24.259
Do I sense a merger in the air?

01:17:24.301 --> 01:17:25.761
Perhaps.

01:17:27.888 --> 01:17:31.308
You do realize you're my stepsister.

01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:33.769
You know what they say about incest.

01:17:37.439 --> 01:17:39.942
Is there any line you won't cross?

01:17:39.983 --> 01:17:44.530
Only one: 
 never in the butt.

01:17:44.613 --> 01:17:46.949
That's a good line.

01:17:48.408 --> 01:17:51.411
The Bradys never had it so good.

01:18:03.048 --> 01:18:05.300
- I can't do this. 
 - Not with your pants on.

01:18:06.385 --> 01:18:09.054
- I gotta go. 
 - You fucking pussy!

01:18:09.137 --> 01:18:11.306
- I gotta get outta this house. 
 - What, is this about Danielle?

01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:15.060
You don't understand, Kathryn. 
 I love her.

01:18:15.143 --> 01:18:19.940
- You have a funny way of showing it. 
 - Fuck you. I won't let you corrupt me.

01:18:20.023 --> 01:18:21.817
Don't you see? 
 You can't change.

01:18:21.859 --> 01:18:25.738
- I can try. 
 - Well, you're gonna die trying.

01:18:39.251 --> 01:18:41.795
- Hello? 
 - Hello, Danielle?

01:19:06.403 --> 01:19:09.073
- Sebastian, you're soaking. 
 - We have to talk.

01:19:09.156 --> 01:19:11.575
Well, come inside 
 before you catch yourself pneumonia.

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:17.664
Here.

01:19:17.748 --> 01:19:18.999
Thanks.

01:19:21.585 --> 01:19:24.087
What's wrong?

01:19:24.171 --> 01:19:26.632
I don't know, it's--

01:19:26.715 --> 01:19:29.968
It's okay. 
 You can talk to me. Go slow.

01:19:31.762 --> 01:19:36.058
I just-- 
 I feel like I'm losing it.

01:19:36.099 --> 01:19:38.143
You know, I gotta get outta New York. 
 I gotta get outta school.

01:19:38.226 --> 01:19:40.354
It's Kathryn, isn't it?

01:19:40.437 --> 01:19:43.398
I don't think I can beat her.

01:19:43.482 --> 01:19:47.027
Sebastian, do you believe 
 in a higher power?

01:19:47.111 --> 01:19:51.281
- Yeah. 
 - Do you believe that love conquers all?

01:19:51.365 --> 01:19:54.201
- Yes. 
 - Do you believe in our love?

01:19:54.284 --> 01:19:56.411
Yeah. It's the only thing 
 keeping me together.

01:19:56.453 --> 01:19:59.915
- So you believe in our love? 
 - Yes, I believe in our love.

01:20:00.624 --> 01:20:02.417
'Cause I sure as hell don't.

01:20:03.961 --> 01:20:05.754
What?

01:20:08.173 --> 01:20:10.259
Fucking idiot.

01:20:12.302 --> 01:20:13.595
Bravo.

01:20:15.514 --> 01:20:19.434
- I told you I could do it. 
 - I should never have doubted you.

01:20:28.193 --> 01:20:30.654
Don't tell me 
 you bought that virgin bullshit.

01:20:30.696 --> 01:20:34.074
No, I saw you. 
 You were with your dad.

01:20:34.158 --> 01:20:35.867
What he doesn't know can't hurt him.

01:20:35.951 --> 01:20:37.911
I am the headmaster's daughter.

01:20:37.994 --> 01:20:40.956
Daddy's little angel must 
 keep up appearances.

01:20:40.998 --> 01:20:45.794
- Holy fuck. 
 - Oh, don't be such a baby.

01:20:45.836 --> 01:20:48.839
You didn't really think 
 you were gonna win, did you?

01:20:48.881 --> 01:20:51.300
- You're welcome to join us. 
 - Hmm?

01:20:51.341 --> 01:20:55.887
You know what they say: Two's company, 
 three's a fuck load of fun.

01:21:02.853 --> 01:21:04.730
Well, if you can't beat 'em--

01:21:04.813 --> 01:21:07.107
Who says you can't beat 'em?

01:21:28.545 --> 01:21:31.340
Share and share alike.

01:21:44.728 --> 01:21:48.941
Sebastian-- Now you'll have 
 something to write about. Danielle.

01:21:59.743 --> 01:22:03.288
- Herzog. 
 - Oh, shit!

01:22:13.966 --> 01:22:16.927
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

01:22:16.969 --> 01:22:19.262
Oh, you really should try 
 to be more careful.

01:22:19.346 --> 01:22:22.391
Thank you. 
 Oh, my bike!

01:22:22.432 --> 01:22:24.726
Could we offer you a ride home?

01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:30.399
Sorry. My mom said I'm not allowed to 
 take rides from strangers. Oh, it's you.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.734
I was just going 
 to Danielle's house.

01:22:34.987 --> 01:22:37.364
- I'll take care of the bike. 
 - Okay.

01:22:41.076 --> 01:22:45.205
- Oh, thank you so much. I owe you huge. 
 - No problem.

01:22:47.916 --> 01:22:50.961
- It's Debbie, right? 
 - No, Cherie.

01:22:51.044 --> 01:22:52.880
Whatever.

01:22:52.963 --> 01:22:55.507
You know, Debbie, has anyone ever told 
 you : you could be a model?

01:22:55.591 --> 01:22:57.551
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

01:22:57.634 --> 01:23:01.263
- It's too bad you're not sexy. Really? 
 - Bull! I can be sexy. Uh-huh.

01:23:02.472 --> 01:23:05.142
All right. 
 Show me sexy.

01:23:09.146 --> 01:23:10.397
Very nice.

01:23:15.486 --> 01:23:19.156
That's my special place. 
 Holy shit!
