WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:08.383
Where are those projections?

00:08.509 --> 00:10.885
Three, six and nine are
in their folders.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.345
- Can I have some more...
- Tea's at your seat.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.138
- Excellent.
- Hello?

00:14.264 --> 00:16.057
Oh, hold on.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.893
Ben Federman again, another pre-call.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.398
We did the pre-call.
Is this the post-pre-call call?

00:23.524 --> 00:24.857
The Board's
gonna want specifics

00:24.983 --> 00:26.818
with the push into the Asian markets.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.361
Ben, there are no specifics about Asia.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.988
We came up with that as a Hail Mary
at 3:00 in the morning

00:31.115 --> 00:32.949
to placate the Board
about International.

00:33.075 --> 00:36.327
Carly, I'm just giving you a heads-up
about Asia.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.287
There is no Asia.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.666
Let's talk about Asia.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.793
We're in the preliminary stages of
forming

00:43.919 --> 00:46.504
a strategic alliance with
Credit Lyonnais.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.965
Within three months,
you won't be able to walk four feet

00:49.091 --> 00:50.842
in Gangnam, South Korea,

00:50.968 --> 00:52.677
without seeing one of
our beautiful models

00:52.803 --> 00:56.848
smiling at you from billboards
and drugstore windows, inviting you in.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.641
That's incredible news, Carly.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.393
We'd hoped to hear
something about Asia.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.770
Had no idea plans were so far along.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.439
Well, you know Asia.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.023
Nothing's done until it's done.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.694
Carly, I was wondering,
could you walk us through

01:09.820 --> 01:12.071
what you were thinking for
other Asian territories?

01:12.197 --> 01:13.322
Absolutely.

01:13.449 --> 01:15.825
India has over half a billion women.

01:15.951 --> 01:18.119
In terms of spending power,
it's the single largest

01:18.245 --> 01:20.747
potential market in the world.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.964
We have retained a local firm to ensure

01:30.090 --> 01:33.259
that cultural differences
are respected.

01:33.385 --> 01:37.096
However, I can't go into the specifics
of my plan with you until tomorrow.

01:37.222 --> 01:40.308
Right now I have a meeting,
and I need the room.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.893
We were just getting started.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.936
I know, and I do apologize.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.730
It's last minute, but the meeting is

01:45.856 --> 01:48.858
with three State Department officials
to smooth the way for China.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.193
China?

01:50.319 --> 01:51.986
This is just incredible.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.070
We'll be in touch.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.447
Thank you.

01:55.991 --> 01:56.991
What is it?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.994
I need a doctor.
I can't move my leg.

02:38.408 --> 02:43.287
32-year-old female, paralysis and
severe pain in her right quad. Go.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.831
How'd she get to you?

02:44.957 --> 02:47.625
She's the CEO of Sonyo Cosmetics.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.962
Three assistants and 15 VPs checked out
who should be treating her.

02:51.088 --> 02:54.048
Who da man? I da man.
I always suspected.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.844
Dr. House, I know the chances are
very slim, but I'm sure you recognize

02:57.970 --> 03:00.638
that she may have what you had,
a clot in her thigh.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.140
A bit of a long shot.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.101
What about a disc herniation?

03:05.227 --> 03:06.227
I don't know, Eric.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.980
If her disc were herniated,
she'd present with pain elsewhere,

03:09.106 --> 03:11.023
wouldn't she?

03:11.149 --> 03:12.817
Yeah, I suppose. You're right.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.903
A clot's also the most deadly,
right, Robert?

03:17.239 --> 03:21.158
True. The clot breaks off,
she could stroke and die.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.869
Dr. House,
I believe that they're right...

03:22.995 --> 03:25.079
Stop talking.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.664
What?

03:26.832 --> 03:29.792
You read one of those negotiating
books, didn't you?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.252
Getting To Yes.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.004
50 Ways to Win an Argument.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.006
Hitchhiker's Guide to Being a Pal.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.049
In five seconds,
you just manipulated these two

03:37.175 --> 03:38.968
into agreeing with your point of view.

03:39.094 --> 03:42.555
Fellas, this is known
as soft positional bargaining.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.725
It's not gonna work.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.894
Dr. House, are you saying that
she doesn't have a clot,

03:48.020 --> 03:51.105
or are you saying that
if she does have a clot,

03:51.231 --> 03:54.483
she doesn't need blood thinners
and an angiogram?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.778
Chase, put her on blood thinners.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.280
Do an angiogram.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.074
When that comes back negative,
MRI the spine.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.369
If that's clean,
cut her open and biopsy the leg.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.787
Excellent suggestion.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.956
Read less, more TV.

04:10.459 --> 04:14.086
It's rare for an individual to
make a donation significant enough

04:14.212 --> 04:18.382
to impact an organization as large
and unwieldy as a hospital.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.928
This donation does come
with one string,

04:22.054 --> 04:24.180
that he be made chairman of the board.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.307
I think that's a reasonable request.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.059
I think he should have
the right to know

04:28.185 --> 04:31.979
what it is we do with his $100,000,000.

04:33.065 --> 04:36.943
Please welcome our new chairman of
the board, Edward Vogler.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.821
Thank you. Thank you.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.910
When I was 18,

04:46.036 --> 04:48.162
my dad loaned me $20,000
for a college tuition,

04:48.288 --> 04:49.705
which he would have known
was a mistake

04:49.831 --> 04:52.375
had he known
I wasn't actually in college.

04:54.544 --> 04:58.756
I took his money and invested in
a friend who had a little business.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.468
And when my dad found out
what I had done with his money,

05:02.594 --> 05:05.888
he and I didn't talk much after that.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.974
But my friend's business took off,

05:08.100 --> 05:09.934
and I used the profits from that

05:10.060 --> 05:12.645
to buy another company, and another.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.314
And I must have been pretty good at it,
had a good eye,

05:15.440 --> 05:18.776
because before I knew it, people
were making offers for my company.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.404
And about a year ago, I went public,

05:21.530 --> 05:23.906
and overnight
I was worth a billion dollars.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.951
So, I went to see my dad.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.745
I'll admit. I wanted a little payback.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.831
You know,
kind of shove the win in his face.

05:31.957 --> 05:35.084
So, I drove upstate and sat
in the kitchen I grew up in,

05:35.210 --> 05:38.129
and he had no reaction.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.884
It wasn't his fault.
He didn't even know who I was,

05:44.886 --> 05:48.097
because his Alzheimer's had taken
a turn for the worse,

05:48.223 --> 05:50.808
despite the best drugs
and care out there.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.310
And that is why I'm here.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.773
What if my contribution to this
hospital is the difference between

05:57.899 --> 06:01.068
no cure and a cure for cancer?

06:01.194 --> 06:05.156
The difference between a man
not recognizing his wife of 35 years

06:05.282 --> 06:07.199
and being able to look at her and say,

06:07.325 --> 06:09.952
"Good morning, honey. I love you."

06:11.872 --> 06:14.790
If there's a disease out there
killing people,

06:14.916 --> 06:17.960
I am writing you a blank check
to fight back.

06:20.130 --> 06:24.175
So, things are going to change a lot.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.646
I'm gonna have to ask you
for the cell phone.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.357
Do what you need to do. I'm okay.

06:40.484 --> 06:44.445
I'm pretty sure my x-ray machine
can take your phone in a fight.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.322
It'll fry it.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.116
Fine.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.746
How old is she?

06:53.872 --> 06:54.914
32.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.125
Wow. And she's already
the CEO of a public company.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.669
She's a workaholic. Okay, Carly.

07:00.796 --> 07:04.465
Hold still. The x-ray machine
is gonna pass over your leg.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.591
Okay.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.093
What'd you do with your time off?

07:07.219 --> 07:09.303
Snowboarding in Gstaad.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.554
Switzerland.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.682
Do you ski or board?
You can come with if you like.

07:13.809 --> 07:17.019
Maybe we should start with a drink
before we go around the world.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.313
Oh, you want to have a drink with me?

07:19.439 --> 07:23.234
Oh, very aggressive. I like that.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.491
I want to run this place
like a business.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.493
What, you want to put more vending
machines in the hallway?

07:32.619 --> 07:33.828
Maybe a roulette wheel?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.038
Nice one. But I'm serious.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.540
The product that you're selling
is good health.

07:37.666 --> 07:38.833
It shouldn't be a tough sell.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.334
If you don't want to sell,
it means you don't care

07:40.460 --> 07:42.711
if people get your product.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.797
Do you care if people are healthy,

07:44.923 --> 07:46.715
or are you too proud for that?

07:49.928 --> 07:51.178
Who's that?

07:55.851 --> 07:58.269
That's just one of our doctors.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.565
Aren't doctors supposed to
wear lab coats?

08:02.691 --> 08:03.649
He's different.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.900
Everyone's buddy.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.610
No, not exactly.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.821
Then why does he get away with it?

08:08.947 --> 08:13.325
It's just a coat. He's very good.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.495
Hmm.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.667
- Say "Ah."
- Ah.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.128
Now really belt it out,
like you're gonna throw up.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.254
Ah...

08:28.842 --> 08:29.842
Perfect.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.094
Okay, that's it.

08:32.220 --> 08:36.599
We should know in a couple of days
what's growing in your son's throat.

08:38.810 --> 08:39.852
Hello?

08:40.729 --> 08:42.354
He can't talk.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.397
Excuse me?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.274
He had knee surgery.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.400
Right?

08:46.526 --> 08:49.820
About a year ago,
and then he couldn't talk.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.781
Right. Yeah, well, that happens.

08:52.908 --> 08:56.952
You know, it's very dangerous operating
so close to the vocal cords.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.581
Okay. Well, we'll send
your kid's culture to the lab

09:00.707 --> 09:02.583
and somebody will call you.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.168
Boo!

09:09.090 --> 09:12.509
Just wanted to see if your dad,
you know...

09:12.636 --> 09:13.761
Bizarre.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.141
I need you to wear your lab coat.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.976
I need two days of outrageous sex

09:21.102 --> 09:22.686
with someone obscenely younger
than you,

09:22.812 --> 09:24.396
like half your age.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.898
Wear the coat.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.693
Man, oh, man, someone got spanked
real good this morning.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.196
A guy gives $100,000,000
to cure cancer.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.074
A pretty small concession
to wear a lab coat.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.700
Cure cancer?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.578
Is the hospital getting out of
the dull business of treating patients?

09:39.704 --> 09:40.746
You know that's not what he's doing.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.039
I know exactly what he's doing.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.041
He's using us to run clinical trials.

09:44.167 --> 09:47.878
Oh, shame on him,
saving lives like that.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.672
It's unethical.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.758
Oh, are you coming in, too?

09:52.884 --> 09:54.009
I thought I had you convinced.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.637
Clinical trials save
thousands of lives.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.847
He's using patients as guinea pigs.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.058
Pharmaceutical companies
do that every day.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.018
Are we a pharmaceutical company?

10:03.144 --> 10:04.937
We're gonna wind up pressuring
desperate patients

10:05.063 --> 10:06.689
into choices that are bad for them,
good for us.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.524
We're gonna compromise patient care.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.067
Who the hell am I talking to?

10:10.193 --> 10:13.612
Suddenly ethical lapses are
a major concern for you?

10:13.738 --> 10:17.241
What's interesting is
it suddenly doesn't bother you.

10:17.784 --> 10:21.787
So, if you ignore ethics to save
one person, it's admirable,

10:21.913 --> 10:23.956
but if you do it to save a thousand,
you're a bastard.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.334
All he's done is taken your game
and gone pro.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.672
He's not gonna kill a few patients.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.465
He's gonna kill this hospital.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.593
It took him three seconds
to size you up.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.138
And surprise, he doesn't like you.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.266
Wear the damn coat.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.691
Hello. I'm Dr. Foreman.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.151
I work with Dr. House.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.738
Our initial tests say you're fine.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.240
We think you had a clot,
but it resolved on its own.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.825
So, we're gonna keep you overnight
to be safe,

10:59.951 --> 11:03.245
and you can go back home tomorrow,
or back to work.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.540
Hey, are you okay?

11:12.422 --> 11:13.839
Get in here! I need a line in her,

11:13.965 --> 11:15.799
IV morphine, stat!

11:27.479 --> 11:29.480
You get any read on
the new chairman of the board?

11:29.606 --> 11:31.607
Yeah, he took your parking space.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.901
It's not necessarily bad news.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.944
Do you ever watch
"Gilligan's Island" reruns,

11:36.071 --> 11:40.366
and really, really think they're gonna
get off the island this time?

11:40.492 --> 11:42.576
We should introduce ourselves.
It couldn't hurt.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.161
Make him a bundt cake.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.580
A patient hit a 10 on the pain scale.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.748
What would explain that?

11:47.874 --> 11:50.709
There was no clot in her leg.
The angio was totally clean.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.002
What about the muscle biopsy?

11:52.128 --> 11:54.713
No neurogenic
or myopathic abnormalities.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.507
She was also negative
for trichinosis.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.385
No toxoplasmosis
or polyarteritis nodosa.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.304
Robert, what was
her sedimentation rate?

12:02.764 --> 12:04.390
Normal, Allison.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.601
Therefore, no inflammation,
no immunologic response.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.562
Do you mind sharing
that number with me?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.940
15, Allison.

12:13.691 --> 12:14.608
Are you mocking me?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.318
Duh, Allison.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.570
I'm just suggesting
we look outside the box.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.364
What if her sed rate is elevated?

12:20.490 --> 12:21.865
Well, let's go further outside the box.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.867
Let's say the angio revealed a clot.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.786
And then let's say
we treated that clot,

12:25.912 --> 12:28.622
and now she's all better, and
personally thanked me by performing...

12:28.748 --> 12:30.624
My Aunt Elyssa lives in Philadelphia.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.670
Oh, it's story time.
Let me get my baa-baa.

12:34.796 --> 12:38.674
Her normal temperature is 96.2,
not 98.6 like you and me.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.969
If her temperature were 98.6,
she'd have a fever.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.721
I'm just wondering
if you think we could

12:44.848 --> 12:47.850
apply the same logic
to Carly's sed rate.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.436
It's absurd.

12:52.564 --> 12:53.605
I love it.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.650
If 15 is high for Carly,
then she has inflammation.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.652
Which could, in turn, mean cancer.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.362
I'll talk to Wilson.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.657
Next time, skip Aunt Elyssa.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.910
You're probably talking about
a primary bone cancer.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.246
It could be tricky to detect.
We'll need a bone scan.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.540
That's why I'm talking to
an oncologist.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.375
Sure. I've nothing better to do,

13:13.501 --> 13:16.670
besides departmental meetings
and budget reports.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.130
New chairman of the board, you know.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.673
Oh, I hadn't heard.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.842
Right. Clinical trials.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.218
Completely unethical.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.095
And a very bad omen for you.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.389
There's not much money in curing
African sleeping sickness.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.225
No. I have seen every scary movie
ever made.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.769
Six-year-old twins in front of
an elevator of blood.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.397
Boys' choirs. Those are bad omens.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.815
This is much more mundane.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.234
A billionaire wants to get laid.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.737
Billionaires buy movie studios
to get laid.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.322
They buy hospitals to get respect.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.741
And the reason you want respect?

13:45.867 --> 13:46.825
To get laid.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.161
Okay, then.
Just gotta think like a billionaire.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.872
Let's see. There'll be big,
scary changes and then,

13:51.998 --> 13:54.082
"Oh, Dr. Cameron, we should have dinner

13:54.209 --> 13:56.835
"to discuss your future on my G5
private jet."

13:56.961 --> 13:58.045
Oh, come on.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.463
You know how good you have it here.

13:59.589 --> 14:02.758
Yes, I'm the big poobah,
the big cheese, the go-to guy.

14:02.884 --> 14:05.427
You do the cases you want to do,
when you want to do them.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.595
You're not gonna have that
anywhere else.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.389
Relax. I've been through three regime
changes in this hospital.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.682
Every time, same story.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.142
Just keep your head down.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.352
That's all I'm saying.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.646
And put on your coat.

14:15.772 --> 14:16.855
It itches.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.776
So, you gonna do this bone scan for me,
or what?

14:20.902 --> 14:22.069
Yes.

14:33.665 --> 14:37.000
Dr. Simpson, did you hear?

14:37.126 --> 14:38.585
New management.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.921
I'm thinking of
switching to orthopedics.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.215
How much do you guys get
for a massage now?

14:43.341 --> 14:44.383
Without the happy ending.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.593
Dr. House, what do you want?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.762
Do you remember a guy
named Van Der Meer?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.764
Not a big talker. You fixed his ACL.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.643
No, not according to my medical
malpractice premiums.

14:54.769 --> 14:57.187
Didn't get hypotensive during surgery?

14:57.313 --> 15:00.107
No strokes?
Maybe some connectivity loss?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.692
What, you're gonna get involved now?

15:01.818 --> 15:02.818
I'm not involved.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.570
A guy brought his son into the clinic.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.988
I didn't touch the son.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.614
I'm not taking
any responsibility there.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.449
The son's fine. Can't shut him up.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.869
Dad show any symptoms of
cortical disease? Wernicke's?

15:14.330 --> 15:15.872
No. Nothing.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.668
That's why we settled,
because we couldn't find anything.

15:19.794 --> 15:20.794
The guy got over $1,000,000.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.796
Don't tell me he's complaining.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.798
He's not saying boo.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.138
Your father wants to know
when you'll be back from your trip.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.558
E-mail back.
It's taking longer than I thought.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.602
He doesn't need to see me like this.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.811
What about your brother?

15:37.937 --> 15:38.854
No.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.607
Hello. I'm Dr. Wilson. I was...

15:41.733 --> 15:42.983
Robin, I'm gonna need a minute.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.359
Oh.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.195
Thank you.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.663
There are two Dr. Wilsons
in this hospital,

15:56.789 --> 15:59.625
one in ophthalmology and one in cancer.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.960
My eyes are fine, so I'm guessing

16:02.086 --> 16:04.379
you're here to tell me
that I have cancer.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.799
There is no cancer in your bone.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.760
You're not smiling.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.262
There's something called referred pain.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.222
You could have cancer
in one part of your body

16:14.349 --> 16:15.766
that presents in another.

16:15.892 --> 16:19.936
Given your age and your family history,
I'm thinking your colon.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.938
Great.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.110
I was at Columbia when my mom died.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.528
Now there's a blast.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.657
Cleaning up her vomit
and then running to my econ final.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.283
Look.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.785
If I'm a short-timer, give me drugs.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.411
I'll go back to work. I'll die there.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.455
Whoa. There's a very quick test

16:38.581 --> 16:40.957
to see if you even have it,
a colonoscopy.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.752
I know how you do that test.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.004
If you have colon cancer,
we can treat it.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.589
It's early.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.174
That's what they told my mom.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.385
She was dead six months later.

16:54.097 --> 16:57.683
You're a smart person about
to make a very bad decision.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.185
You know, cancer treatment's come
a long way in 12 years,

17:00.311 --> 17:01.269
but if you don't do this now...

17:01.396 --> 17:03.271
I don't want to be looked at.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.157
There is another way.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.286
We could do a virtual colonoscopy.

17:18.413 --> 17:21.748
Basically,
we do a CT scan of your colon.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.916
It's noninvasive.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.126
But it's very expensive.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.670
I'm assuming that's not a problem.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.509
Say yes.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.018
Mr. Van Der Meer.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.105
What?

17:48.359 --> 17:51.903
Relax. Ricky's gonna be just "finkf."
Strep throat.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.822
Here's a prescription
for an antibiotic.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.907
He should be all better in a few days.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.703
Although, this might sting a little.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.135
I want to see you again real soon.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.639
Virtual colonoscopy was clean.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.600
No colon cancer.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.810
What happened to our regular,
old-fashioned colonoscopy?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.645
She was uncomfortable
doing any more tests.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.898
I had to convince her to do that one.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.274
Do you get that often?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.527
Women would rather die
than get naked with you?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.780
She's scared.

18:35.323 --> 18:38.742
But not of tests.
Just embarrassing ones.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.620
Yeah.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.501
It's not an inflammatory process.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.754
It's not a clot,
because Chase's angio says so.

18:51.172 --> 18:54.508
And it's not cancer,
because her tush is perfect.

18:55.843 --> 18:59.054
Anybody else got an Aunt Elyssa
with weird stuff?

19:01.057 --> 19:02.349
Maybe it's worth looking into...

19:02.475 --> 19:05.393
I thought you said
Carly's angio was clean.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.729
It was clean.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.782
You guys see the problem here?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.745
There's no indication of
any abnormalities.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.497
No lesions, no spurs, no...

19:25.623 --> 19:27.833
Her toes are screwed up.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.084
They're backwards.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.837
You guys know how much surgery
it's gonna take

19:31.963 --> 19:33.755
to swap them back?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.382
What are you talking about?

19:35.508 --> 19:40.011
Well, either she literally has two left
feet, or you angioed the wrong leg.

19:47.562 --> 19:48.770
That's impossible.
It can't be the wrong leg.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.188
Or maybe it was Jenny.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.524
How come some resident
signed this radiology report?

19:52.650 --> 19:53.608
Were you even in the room?

19:53.734 --> 19:54.776
I'll redo her angio...

19:54.902 --> 19:56.695
You'll do nothing!

20:02.118 --> 20:04.369
Foreman, you do the angiogram.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.883
I can't believe I did that.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.931
Why do we have to redo the angiogram?

20:25.433 --> 20:27.601
There was a shadow
on the first test result.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.060
Shadow?

20:30.313 --> 20:33.565
A shadow means there could be
a blood clot, right?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.943
I read "Conn's Current Therapy".

20:37.069 --> 20:38.528
A real page-turner.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.655
No, it wasn't that kind of shadow.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.576
My chest hurts.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.245
It's from the tracer I injected.

20:47.371 --> 20:51.541
You might also get a little nauseous
or have a metallic taste. All normal.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.127
I'm a runner.
I shouldn't feel like this.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.671
Carly,
I'm looking at your vitals right now...

20:56.797 --> 20:58.340
I can't breathe.

20:58.466 --> 20:59.799
Carly?

21:01.260 --> 21:07.307
My chest.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.730
Respiratory arrest. Call a code.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.315
What do you got?

21:15.441 --> 21:16.775
She's drowning.

21:34.543 --> 21:37.295
Foreman did a thoracentesis
to drain the fluid from her lungs.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.673
She's stable.
They sent the fluid to the lab.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.132
It'll be back in a few hours.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.761
You'll be happy to know
Chase's mistake didn't cost her.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.805
Angio revealed no clot.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.723
I'm thrilled.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.624
Okay, see,
now you're just being stubborn.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.793
It's cold. It's a perfectly good excuse
to wear your lab coat.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.295
Carly needs a heart transplant.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.174
Thoracentesis revealed a transudate?

23:46.300 --> 23:48.468
I haven't gotten it back yet.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.513
Her MUGA scan,
what was the ejection fraction?

23:51.639 --> 23:53.515
Maybe you could treat it surgically.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.683
I haven't done the MUGA.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.978
How do you know
she needs a heart transplant?

23:59.105 --> 24:00.855
I got my aura read today.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.316
It said someone close to me
had a broken heart.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.819
Since when do I need
the secret pass code to talk to you?

24:05.945 --> 24:08.238
I can't tell you anything.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.073
Professional responsibility.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.407
Like that matters to you.

24:11.534 --> 24:14.744
Not my professional responsibility,
yours.

24:14.870 --> 24:15.912
New regime.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.455
You gotta keep your head down, too.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.833
Now that's good thinking,
because I was gonna go right to Cuddy

24:19.959 --> 24:21.459
and rat you out as soon as
you were done talking.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.585
I'm not saying you want to.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.796
I'm saying you'd be obligated to.

24:24.922 --> 24:27.507
Because of my position on the Board?

24:30.845 --> 24:34.180
Because of my position
on the transplant committee?

24:36.267 --> 24:38.560
Hey, you brought this up for a reason.
You need to talk to me.

24:38.686 --> 24:39.978
I can't.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.443
You sure you're doing the right thing?

24:47.570 --> 24:50.822
I've come up with a few
really great rationalizations.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.867
Sorry to interrupt. We have a problem.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.536
Thoracentesis
revealed a transudate.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.664
We did an echo. She's in severe
congestive heart failure.

24:59.790 --> 25:02.125
She needs a heart transplant.

25:03.711 --> 25:04.752
We'll get her on the list immediately.

25:04.879 --> 25:07.839
She's already on the list.

25:15.639 --> 25:16.890
Come in.

25:17.474 --> 25:18.766
Thanks.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.646
What is a Department of
Diagnostic Medicine?

25:25.649 --> 25:27.650
That's Dr. House's department.

25:27.776 --> 25:31.487
They deal with cases that
other doctors can't figure out.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.449
It's a financial black hole.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.826
The department costs us
$3,000,000 a year

25:36.952 --> 25:38.411
to treat one patient a week.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.787
He saves one patient per week.

25:39.914 --> 25:41.331
What about everyone else?

25:41.457 --> 25:44.042
His department's not going to find
the cure for breast cancer.

25:44.168 --> 25:45.460
Maybe not, but...

25:45.586 --> 25:47.545
Are you sleeping with House?

25:47.671 --> 25:49.297
What? No.

25:49.423 --> 25:50.548
But you did, right?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.467
A long time ago?

25:53.594 --> 25:56.221
That's an incredibly
inappropriate question.

25:56.347 --> 25:58.431
If your judgment is compromised
by a prior

25:58.557 --> 26:00.141
or current relationship,
that is my business.

26:00.267 --> 26:03.478
I respect him.
That is all you need to know.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.396
He's still not wearing the coat.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.481
Well, I told him...

26:06.607 --> 26:07.941
I'm sure you did.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.401
And yet he's not wearing it.

26:10.527 --> 26:14.322
I'm just wondering if that's
a reflection on him or on you.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.380
You're Dr. House.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.257
I found a picture online of you
at a conference.

26:32.383 --> 26:34.550
You need a heart transplant.

26:35.511 --> 26:36.469
I run. I work out...

26:36.595 --> 26:38.179
You cut yourself.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.933
Probably highly ritualized.

26:42.059 --> 26:45.478
You play the same Sarah McLachlan song
over and over while you do it.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.606
Probably works better
than antidepressants.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.316
I don't understand how...

26:50.442 --> 26:51.985
You're a high-powered bulimic.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.028
You make yourself throw up.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.490
You had to find the most efficient way
to vomit

26:57.616 --> 26:59.826
without revealing
the telltale signs of bulimia,

26:59.952 --> 27:03.579
which is all very unseemly for a CEO.

27:03.706 --> 27:08.751
So, you found a common antidote
to accidental poisoning to do the job.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.503
Ipecac.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.798
Which is great if your kid's
just swallowed a bottle of aspirin,

27:13.924 --> 27:16.718
but really, really bad if it's a habit.

27:17.553 --> 27:19.846
It causes muscle damage.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.681
It caused the pain in your leg.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.602
And destroyed your heart.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.649
How often do you do it?

27:37.656 --> 27:39.407
Three times a week.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.704
In about an hour,

27:44.830 --> 27:47.415
there's gonna be an emergency meeting
of the transplant committee

27:47.541 --> 27:52.045
to discuss where you fall on the list
should a new heart become available.

27:52.171 --> 27:56.007
Problem is, I am required to tell
the committee about your bulimia.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.259
It's a major psychiatric condition.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.802
Ranks right up there with suicidal.

27:59.928 --> 28:02.221
Makes you a very bad risk.

28:02.348 --> 28:05.975
So, you're here to tell me
I have just a few hours to live?

28:07.686 --> 28:09.771
Unless I lie to the committee.

28:12.274 --> 28:15.401
But if they find out,
I lose my medical license.

28:17.154 --> 28:20.573
This would be a very good time
to offer me a bribe.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.117
You know, how much is your life worth?
How much is my job worth?

28:23.243 --> 28:25.578
Why are you here doing this to me?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.664
What do you want?

28:29.666 --> 28:32.668
I want to know what's right.

28:33.504 --> 28:34.962
Am I worth it?

28:37.299 --> 28:39.217
You think I'm pathetic.

28:39.968 --> 28:43.554
Has a good job.
Everything in the world.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.306
But she just doesn't like
the way that she looks...

28:45.432 --> 28:46.974
Oh, stop hiding!

28:48.102 --> 28:49.977
I'm asking you
if you want to live or die.

28:50.104 --> 28:51.270
You can't even say that.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.897
What do you want me to do? Cry?

28:53.023 --> 28:54.023
Yes!

28:54.149 --> 28:56.401
I want you to tell me
that your life is important to you,

28:56.527 --> 28:58.820
because I don't know!

29:02.658 --> 29:07.662
Because that's what's on the table
right now, your life.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.305
I don't want to die.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.269
I don't.

29:39.778 --> 29:43.156
This 32-year-old female
was admitted by my staff

29:43.282 --> 29:46.117
because of paralysis
and pain in her right thigh.

29:46.243 --> 29:47.743
The patient rapidly deteriorated

29:47.870 --> 29:50.705
and now has severe
congestive heart failure.

29:50.831 --> 29:54.417
Pressors and vasodilators have not
improved her condition whatsoever.

29:54.543 --> 29:57.670
Pulmonary function tests show
an FEC of over three liters,

29:57.796 --> 30:01.632
with FEV-1 of
at least 90% of predicted,

30:01.758 --> 30:06.387
and preserved FEV/FVC ratio
and preserved DLCO as well.

30:07.055 --> 30:09.807
Her MUGA had
an ejection fraction of 19%,

30:09.933 --> 30:12.685
with no focal wall motion
abnormalities.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.854
Heart catheterization revealed

30:14.980 --> 30:17.398
clean left, right
and circumflex arteries,

30:17.524 --> 30:21.694
and a subsequent biopsy revealed
irreversible cardiomyopathy.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.155
Which is why we're here.

30:24.281 --> 30:27.408
Dr. House, I'm confused by your time
and date stamps.

30:27.534 --> 30:30.161
It appears that you put Carly
on the transplant list

30:30.287 --> 30:32.371
before you did these tests.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.709
I had a hunch.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.961
You don't have hunches. You know.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.838
Look, if the tests had come back
differently,

30:40.964 --> 30:42.590
obviously I would have taken her off
the list.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.634
But on the long shot...

30:47.596 --> 30:51.641
On the long shot that I was right,
I didn't want to waste time.

30:54.728 --> 30:57.939
Is there any exclusion criteria
we should know about?

30:59.525 --> 31:03.694
CAT scan revealed no tumors, and Dr.
Wilson found no trace of cancer.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.157
What about any other criteria?

31:08.283 --> 31:10.034
No atherosclerotic vascular disease.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.160
Are there any...

31:11.286 --> 31:12.787
No pneumonia, no bacteremia.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.706
No hep B or C or any other letters.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.042
Substance abuse. Any history...

31:18.168 --> 31:20.086
No alcohol. No drugs.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.214
Any psychiatric conditions?
History of depression?

31:23.340 --> 31:25.132
She's a little blue.

31:25.259 --> 31:28.052
But turns out
she needs a heart transplant.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.437
Dr. House, if you subvert
or mislead this committee,

31:38.564 --> 31:41.357
you will be subject to
disciplinary action.

31:46.572 --> 31:50.199
Dr. Cuddy, do you have any reason
to think that I would lie?

31:50.325 --> 31:53.578
I simply want you to answer
the question.

31:53.704 --> 31:56.831
Is there anything on the recipient
exclusion criteria

31:56.957 --> 32:00.876
that would disqualify your patient
from getting a heart?

32:12.306 --> 32:13.556
No.

32:21.732 --> 32:23.858
Beautiful organ-donor weather.

32:24.735 --> 32:26.485
You lied, didn't you?

32:26.612 --> 32:28.613
- I never lie.
- Big mistake.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.575
Then you should have voted
against putting her on the list.

32:32.701 --> 32:33.701
You're my friend.

32:33.827 --> 32:36.537
Oh, jeez, have some backbone.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.414
If you think I'm wrong, do something.

32:38.540 --> 32:41.000
Wait. You're getting mad at me
for sticking up for you?

32:41.126 --> 32:44.545
You value our friendship more than
your ethical responsibilities.

32:44.671 --> 32:47.590
Our friendship is
an ethical responsibility.

32:53.263 --> 32:54.722
What is it?

32:55.766 --> 32:57.433
My patient's getting a heart.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.115
He's not gonna fire you.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.368
I'd fire you. Bye-bye.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.830
I screw up, the patient dies,
I'll never get another job.

33:19.956 --> 33:24.335
So stick your head between your legs
and go lick your wounds in Gstaad.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.754
I like it here.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.553
You guys don't think
it's weird House knew

33:34.680 --> 33:38.641
the patient needed a heart transplant
before we did any heart tests?

33:39.393 --> 33:41.519
That's House. He knows things.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.729
But usually he's putting it
in our face.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.439
Telling us how cleverly
he figured it out.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.984
This time, nothing.
Just "I had a hunch."

33:51.279 --> 33:52.780
That is weird.

34:25.522 --> 34:27.690
Cauterize that one bleeder.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.280
Okay, ready for the donor heart.

34:40.078 --> 34:43.289
They just stopped Carly's heart,
and your dumb patient...

34:43.415 --> 34:45.332
They're all...
Oh, the guy who can't talk.

34:45.459 --> 34:46.459
Mr. Van Der Meer.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.085
He's scheduled an appointment
to see you.

34:48.211 --> 34:49.962
Oh, goody.

34:51.882 --> 34:55.760
I wanted you to know Chase is worried
you're going to fire him.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.513
It's bad enough
that screw-ups cost lives.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.475
Now we've got Vogler,
screw-ups cost jobs.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.851
I want Chase scared.

35:03.977 --> 35:06.562
I want him doing everything
he can to protect his job.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.105
Dr. House, if you were in his position,

35:08.231 --> 35:10.483
wouldn't you be more likely to perform
well if you were reassured...

35:10.609 --> 35:11.817
Oh, will you stop it

35:11.943 --> 35:13.569
with the book?

35:13.820 --> 35:15.237
Why are you doing this?

35:16.323 --> 35:17.406
I'm not doing anything.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.700
You're manipulating everyone.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.831
People dismiss me.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.169
Because I'm a woman.
Because I'm pretty.

35:30.295 --> 35:33.339
Because I'm not aggressive.

35:35.383 --> 35:39.678
My opinions shouldn't be rejected
just because people don't like me.

35:39.888 --> 35:44.141
They like you. Everyone likes you.

35:47.354 --> 35:48.771
Do you?

36:08.083 --> 36:09.542
I have to know.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.710
No.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.179
Okay.

36:40.365 --> 36:43.409
Five hours, 23 minutes. That's fast.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.286
Is that good or bad?

36:45.412 --> 36:46.495
It depends.

36:46.621 --> 36:50.332
Either surgery went really well,
or it ended really abruptly.

36:53.003 --> 36:55.588
Textbook. She'll outlive us all.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.091
Thank you.

37:04.598 --> 37:07.182
Triage nurse,
pick up line 2741.

37:09.477 --> 37:12.479
So, sing for me.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.986
Oh, no, no, no, no. Come on, look.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.280
When you had your surgery,
you were intubated.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.073
The surgeon stuck a tube
down your throat.

37:23.199 --> 37:26.118
Now, it never happens
and it's never caught, but it happened.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.536
Your vocal cords were paralyzed.

37:27.662 --> 37:30.956
I treated the spastic dysphonia
with Botox.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.499
Ironically, a substance that tightens

37:32.626 --> 37:35.461
every other corner of your face
actually loosens the tongue.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.005
I have healed you. You can talk.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.512
Oh, well.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.389
Boo!

37:52.062 --> 37:54.063
Okay. You don't have to say anything.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.773
It can be our little secret.

37:55.899 --> 37:59.360
If you can talk, blink twice.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.740
But you're not going to,

38:04.866 --> 38:07.326
because you think you won't be entitled
to the money you won

38:07.452 --> 38:09.828
in the settlement with Simpson.

38:11.957 --> 38:15.125
Yesterday, I would have said
you had to give the money back.

38:15.251 --> 38:18.420
Today, hospital's come into
a lot of money.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.882
Mum's the word.

38:58.670 --> 39:02.297
Hey.

39:04.467 --> 39:07.761
I know the cardiologist has given you
some guidelines,

39:07.887 --> 39:11.140
a schedule of medication
and a strict diet.

39:12.142 --> 39:15.352
Just what somebody
with an eating disorder needs.

39:15.770 --> 39:18.355
So I thought I'd get you started.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.817
Fried chicken from the Carnegie Deli.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.778
You're kidding.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.032
Yeah. Actually, I got it downstairs.

39:33.079 --> 39:35.122
Why did you fight for me?

39:36.666 --> 39:40.335
You risked so much,
and you hardly know me.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.760
You're my patient.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.058
Don't screw it up.

40:41.356 --> 40:42.856
Love this part!

40:49.697 --> 40:51.907
Okay. He ruined it.

40:53.243 --> 40:54.618
Just wanted to stop by
and introduce myself.

40:54.744 --> 40:57.329
I'm Edward Vogler,
new chairman of the board.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.332
In a way, I guess
that makes me your boss.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.752
I am sorry about the lab coat thing.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.213
My dry cleaners just destroyed it.

41:07.257 --> 41:11.093
That was my very first heart-transplant
committee meeting. Very exciting.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.929
Trust me, Six Flags, way more exciting.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.932
Your patient's very lucky
to have such a passionate doctor.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.101
Stands up for what he believes in.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.811
Sweet of you to say.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.772
Yeah.
Afraid you've been duped, though.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.859
The nurse found this
in the patient's purse.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.700
Oh, my. If only I'd known.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.953
Tough being a doctor,
having all that power.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.581
The power to play God.

41:40.707 --> 41:44.668
Yes. I don't envy the transplant
committee their responsibility.

41:45.378 --> 41:48.714
They basically would have been forced
to kill that poor girl.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.341
I'm not sure I could have done that.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.595
This is not a game to me, Dr. House.

41:54.721 --> 41:55.846
No.

41:56.222 --> 41:59.558
It's actually more like
we're dancing right now.

41:59.684 --> 42:02.144
So let's get to the point.
You don't like me.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.188
I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna like you.

42:04.314 --> 42:07.274
It's nothing personal.
I don't like anybody.

42:08.318 --> 42:09.902
But none of that really matters,
does it?

42:10.028 --> 42:13.071
Because you've got money,
and I've got tenure.

42:13.573 --> 42:16.200
You need full Board approval
to get rid of me.

42:16.326 --> 42:18.243
- I've got Cuddy.
- Right.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.703
And Wilson.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.624
So, as long as we're stuck
with each other,

42:23.750 --> 42:26.210
we might as well ignore each other.

42:32.008 --> 42:34.259
That wasn't nearly as dramatic as
I was hoping.

42:37.764 --> 42:41.183
I looked into that tenure thing,
and you're right.

42:41.309 --> 42:43.727
It's actually easier for me to get rid
of a board member

42:43.853 --> 42:47.105
like Cuddy or Wilson
than to get rid of a doctor.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.691
That's interesting, isn't it?
