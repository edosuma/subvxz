00:53.680 --> 00:54.875
Morning, Michael.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.832
Do you know who Maslow is, Michael?

01:02.040 --> 01:03.840
You don't mind if I call you Michael, do you?

01:04.480 --> 01:05.630
You can call me Sebastian.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.235
Maslow originated the "Hierarchy of Needs".

01:11.280 --> 01:16.230
Now, that's the theory human beings
are motivated by a set of requirements

01:16.280 --> 01:18.033
which can be expressed...

01:18.880 --> 01:20.758
in the form of a pyramid

01:21.480 --> 01:24.040
with the most basic physiological needs
at the bottom

01:24.080 --> 01:25.309
and then passing through...

01:25.960 --> 01:28.475
safety, belonging

01:28.960 --> 01:31.919
esteem, self-actualisation

01:31.960 --> 01:36.079
and then rather loftily at the top,
self-transcendence.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.594
Now, you will be fed and watered

01:39.760 --> 01:42.120
except on the days
when I need to operate on you, of course.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.398
And you'll have a roof over your head

01:44.440 --> 01:46.477
and the room will be a constant 22 degrees.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.920
Each room in the compound
has reinforced glass and fingerprint access

01:51.960 --> 01:54.111
and there are guards on every door

01:55.240 --> 01:57.038
so you will feel safe.

02:00.040 --> 02:03.317
You belong to us.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.673
Now, not in the sense of possession

02:06.720 --> 02:09.155
but rather as a member of our family,
of our mission

02:09.199 --> 02:14.355
and I hope that through that
you will achieve esteem, because you are...

02:17.120 --> 02:18.474
important to us.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.469
And I hope that through that

02:23.880 --> 02:28.079
we can mine the potential
that lies inside you

02:29.840 --> 02:33.754
and you will achieve self-transcendence,
where your value to yourself

02:33.800 --> 02:35.917
is far exceeded by the greater good.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.880
The very top of the pyramid...

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
imagine that.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.195
Didn't they sacrifice people
at the top of pyramids?

02:56.280 --> 02:58.556
Only if the gods demanded it.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.317
I look forward to more of our little chats,
Michael.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.317
You can have them by yourself,
cos I ain't staying.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.354
No, no. Even if you could escape,
which I very much doubt

03:14.640 --> 03:16.440
we've found you once
and we'll find you again.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.639
I told you we'd find you, Michael.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.316
I have so missed our little chats.

03:50.760 --> 03:51.760
Target secured.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.276
<i>Good work.</i>

03:54.240 --> 03:56.709
There'll be a police escort
waiting for you in Manchester.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.392
They'll take you to your air-evac.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.360
<i>I don't need a chaperone.</i>

04:01.760 --> 04:03.160
Their town, their rules.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.752
<i>And they don't respect
the chain of command.</i>

04:09.200 --> 04:10.953
Do the racing vehicles pose any risks?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.030
<i>Only to themselves.</i>

04:13.480 --> 04:14.480
Good.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.274
I'm calling off your support.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.314
<i>The Manchester boys don't need to know
the value of your cargo.</i>

04:20.519 --> 04:21.519
Sir.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.832
<i>Pursuit vehicles, return to base.</i>

05:48.080 --> 05:50.914
Kaye. Why do they want Michael so bad?

05:51.280 --> 05:54.000
There's no time to explain,
I've just got to get him back.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.560
Kaye.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.120
<i>Kaye?</i>

06:12.560 --> 06:13.596
I hope he's worth it.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.916
They're gonna get me out.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.836
This is a three-and-a-half-tonne
prison truck, Michael.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.394
I'm afraid no one's getting in or out

06:24.440 --> 06:28.116
so it's imperative that you trust me,
and do exactly what I say.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.356
Why should I trust you?

06:30.840 --> 06:32.240
Do you ever question your choices?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.870
Like a soldier realising he's fighting
for the wrong side.

06:35.920 --> 06:36.920
Enough of your shit.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.912
My loyalties are no longer with Brookeheath.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.311
They're only interested in monetising
the cure.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.271
Professor Newman
has pulled the wool from my eyes.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.920
Helen's dead.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.353
She was in an induced coma.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.238
I managed to revive her temporarily.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.318
Her entire research was focused on
why you were the one person

07:00.360 --> 07:01.360
who didn't get sick.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.794
She spent months poring over
your biometric data.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.120
Looking for the glitch.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.797
For that grain of sand that might someday
turn into a pearl.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.916
We now think the answer's in your past.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.351
If I can find out exactly what it is

07:18.400 --> 07:22.189
then I can find a cure for everyone,
without Brookeheath.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.670
So, please, Michael

07:28.240 --> 07:29.240
will you help me?

08:08.240 --> 08:09.469
You wanna help her, don't you?

08:11.120 --> 08:12.560
If you really wanna help, we should.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.155
Kaye's just lost her sister.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.750
That guy of hers is probably
the only person she's got left in the world.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.598
Mum, I said I don't mind.
- Yeah, I know.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.517
Calling all racers.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.716
<i>Kaye needs our help.</i>

08:26.240 --> 08:28.096
- They're behind us.
- What the fuck?

08:28.120 --> 08:29.120
Where'd they come from?

08:29.600 --> 08:32.717
<i>I know we've all got a race to win
but there's a Brookeheath truck.</i>

08:33.120 --> 08:35.191
<i>We have to stop it and get Michael back.</i>

08:36.200 --> 08:37.429
Sorry, not our problem.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.234
<i>No, no, no, we need to help.</i>

08:39.280 --> 08:41.360
<i>I can see them.
They're about two miles back.</i>

08:41.600 --> 08:44.672
Look at that thing,
it's got a bulletproof windshield...

08:45.120 --> 08:47.077
<i>sixty mil homogenous steel shell</i>

08:47.600 --> 08:49.520
and I think they come with Bluetooth
as standard.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.517
Yeah, but is it waterproof?

08:53.560 --> 08:55.677
Why don't you just try
tossing banana skins at it?

08:56.800 --> 08:58.080
<i>That's a great idea!</i>

08:58.480 --> 08:59.480
That is a good idea.

09:00.720 --> 09:01.836
We have to help them.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.954
Roman, we are in sixth place.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.237
Michael could potentially be the cure
for the virus.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.876
What?
- It started at a place called Kiloran.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.600
He was the only one that didn't get sick.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.079
Brookeheath, they've already torn him apart
trying to figure out why.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.874
How can you be so sure?

09:16.920 --> 09:18.832
Brookeheath was the system
me and Linus hacked

09:18.880 --> 09:20.080
and look what happened to him.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.631
Why couldn't you just look up pornography
like a normal teenager?

09:26.480 --> 09:27.480
<i>Hang on...</i>

09:27.880 --> 09:29.837
what if I play the sexy hitchhiker?

09:30.800 --> 09:33.156
<i>Alright, enough - I don't need your help.</i>

09:33.560 --> 09:35.313
We've lost enough people in this race.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
What's wrong with her?

09:37.480 --> 09:38.311
Fine.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.320
<i>- Proper moody and that.</i>
- I've got an idea.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.256
What about the bazooka?
- Careful, darling.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.954
I thought the idea was to save Michael,
not blow him up.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.515
Those guys said the truck
was 60 mils thick, right?

09:48.560 --> 09:50.313
Yeah. "Those guys" are morons.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.512
Well, these are armour-piercing
up to 50 mils.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.776
<i>So it should be able to stop
the truck but not kill Michael.</i>

09:54.800 --> 09:57.240
Do we need to get in front
so you can fire it backwards again?

09:57.680 --> 10:00.036
<i>If you wanna help,
pass it through the window.</i>

10:01.560 --> 10:03.950
That's probably for the best,
after what happened last time.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.360
Go on.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.376
I thought she didn't want our help.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.595
I don't want your help.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.790
<i>I want your bazooka.</i>

10:10.280 --> 10:11.600
What if we need it later?

10:11.880 --> 10:15.032
Oh, come on - future of humanity,
or selfish bitch.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.993
Selfish bitch.
- Zane?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
He's with me.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.035
Alright, Mum, deciding vote.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.640
You're like the head judge on <i>Strictly.</i>

10:26.160 --> 10:28.356
You seriously think there's a chance
of finding a cure?

10:28.480 --> 10:29.800
There's a reason they want him.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.589
Then we've got to do it.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.153
Zane, slow down.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.240
Fucking <i>Strictly.</i>

11:17.920 --> 11:20.594
The safety's on but it's really sensitive,
so be careful.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.200
You got it?

11:22.960 --> 11:23.960
<i>Got it.</i>

11:28.800 --> 11:29.800
Easy now...

11:31.720 --> 11:32.720
<i>It's loaded.</i>

11:32.840 --> 11:33.840
Good.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.480
Right, let's go back
to the day of your accident.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.200
We need to go through everything again.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.436
We've been through this.

12:42.240 --> 12:45.360
Yes, and we're gonna go through it again
until we find the answer that we need.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.956
Molehills can be mountains,
acorns can be oaks.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.115
I need full disclosure.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.434
I broke my back.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.520
I was in a car crash.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.040
How did the road feel? Was it wet?

12:58.600 --> 13:01.160
Dirty? Could your wounds have become
contaminated in some way?

13:05.520 --> 13:09.673
Michael, I know this is difficult,
but we don't have much time.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.791
If we get to Manchester,
they'll take you back to London

13:12.840 --> 13:14.240
and they'll rip out your spine.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.790
Right, let's talk about the trials
at the Kiloran Institute.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.832
Now, they were overseen
by Professor Newman

13:23.160 --> 13:25.120
and that's where you first met
her daughter, Kaye.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.991
<i>We do need to assess how much you can feel.</i>

13:30.040 --> 13:31.600
<i>You wanna know how I feel?</i>

13:32.480 --> 13:33.480
<i>Yes.</i>

13:33.920 --> 13:35.036
Like my life's over.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.757
You wouldn't have been offered a place
on this trial if there wasn't a chance.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.279
Now, according to your medical records,
it says you were admitted T-Nine

13:47.320 --> 13:48.800
with no sensation from the waist down

13:48.840 --> 13:52.800
but your recovery from the surgery
is nothing short of miraculous.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.416
<i>Now, we know
the clinical trials you were involved in</i>

13:56.440 --> 13:57.840
<i>at Kiloran led to the outbreak.</i>

13:58.600 --> 14:00.717
<i>Every patient was infected except you.</i>

14:01.880 --> 14:03.394
You were discharged, what happened?

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
I left.

14:04.880 --> 14:05.880
With Kaye Newman?

14:07.840 --> 14:09.194
<i>That's what it says.</i>

14:10.720 --> 14:12.960
And you experienced no further reaction
to the treatment?

14:13.040 --> 14:14.040
No.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.714
Kaye didn't augment the course?

14:15.760 --> 14:18.594
She didn't offer you any supplementary drugs?
- No.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.995
OK. What next?

14:22.960 --> 14:24.917
Kaye went to see her mother and disappeared.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.230
She left me in Cornwall.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.896
And that's when you started a relationship
with the younger sister, Ruby?

14:28.920 --> 14:31.480
I didn't know Helen was ill!
I thought Kaye'd cut me out.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.600
I'm not here to judge you, Michael.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.720
Alright, let's go back further

14:42.480 --> 14:43.914
to the days before the accident.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.296
I don't see what that's got to do
with anything.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.710
Michael, I thought
I'd made myself very clear.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.878
Look, even if what you're saying is true,
about leaving Brookeheath

14:55.200 --> 14:56.200
this isn't my fight.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.400
Then whose is it?

14:57.440 --> 15:00.638
People like you, Helen - scientists.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.637
Yes, and we're doing our bit

15:03.640 --> 15:05.472
but you were the start,
you were Patient Zero

15:05.520 --> 15:07.736
you're the reason why we're all here.
- So it's all my fault?

15:07.760 --> 15:08.830
For wanting to walk again?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.520
No, but it will be your fault
if you walk away.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.232
But then that's what you do,
isn't it, Michael?

15:14.520 --> 15:16.273
That's what our evaluations told us.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.394
In conversation, you hide

15:18.560 --> 15:21.016
you walked away from Brookeheath
and now you're gonna walk away again

15:21.040 --> 15:22.040
and to what?

15:22.640 --> 15:24.757
To sit on a beach and sip cocktails

15:24.800 --> 15:27.315
and pretend not to think about the millions
you've left to die?

15:52.200 --> 15:53.316
This had better work.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.155
It's alright, Kaye.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.600
We'll help you.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.519
That sounded very much like the last
throw of the dice from your friends.

17:10.599 --> 17:14.640
So if you will, I want to go back
to the days before the accident.

17:16.599 --> 17:17.795
<i>12-gauge.</i>

17:18.599 --> 17:19.636
Multi-choke.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.079
Magazine-fed.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.190
Minimal recoil, maximum fire power.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.200
Wanna hold it?

17:33.760 --> 17:34.760
No, I'm alright.

17:37.840 --> 17:38.840
Fucking hold it.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.919
You know you have to do tests
as part of job interviews now?

17:48.040 --> 17:51.033
In my day it was just word of mouth,
shake of the hand and you were in.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.835
That's why things were crap.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.390
Fucking unions,
job for life, all that bollocks.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.036
I'm an entrepreneur

18:01.720 --> 18:02.720
professional

18:03.640 --> 18:06.872
and I only work with other professionals.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.432
Now, you come highly recommended, I know

18:14.880 --> 18:16.075
but I need to know

18:18.120 --> 18:19.474
if you've got what it takes.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.240
Can you keep your head together?

18:23.320 --> 18:24.320
Relax?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.835
When your heart's thumping 20 to the dozen

18:28.120 --> 18:29.998
and your balls have shot up into your gut

18:30.240 --> 18:33.199
and you wanna fucking explode
with the power of it all.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.633
I've done my fair share of work.

18:39.360 --> 18:43.149
I'm not talking about all that
Mickey Mouse moped bollocks.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.753
Smashing shop windows and grabbing
an handful of costume jewellery?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.434
I'm talking about proper work.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.275
Four wheels, two barrels.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.320
What do you reckon?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.559
You ready to make some serious money?

19:15.480 --> 19:16.675
Yeah. Good lad.

19:17.840 --> 19:18.840
<i>Michael?</i>

19:21.400 --> 19:22.400
Michael.

19:23.880 --> 19:24.996
I was robbing a bank.

19:31.160 --> 19:34.119
We do this right, you won't need it.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.680
I've got a family, remember?

19:38.400 --> 19:40.710
Nothing's gonna happen
that stops me getting back to them.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.514
So just relax, right?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.195
Nobody gets hurt, then.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.640
You looking at?

20:04.840 --> 20:05.840
Come on.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.160
Shit...

20:17.760 --> 20:19.035
Why wasn't this in the files?

20:23.240 --> 20:24.560
Keep your ears open

20:24.600 --> 20:25.670
and your mouths shut.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.310
Anyone looks at me

20:29.840 --> 20:31.797
I'm the last fucking thing you'll ever see.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.557
Good. Bag it up.

20:40.560 --> 20:41.560
One minute!

20:54.400 --> 20:55.800
- Bless you.
- Who said that?

21:03.600 --> 21:04.636
Who said that?

21:07.680 --> 21:08.680
I did.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.520
30 seconds!

21:17.920 --> 21:18.920
Say it again.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.790
I only said "bless you" because...
you sneezed.

21:26.960 --> 21:27.960
Bless me?

21:28.920 --> 21:29.751
Why?

21:29.920 --> 21:31.798
Cos I'm a sinner
and you're the fucking pope?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.154
Easy now, we're almost there, man.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.520
You want me to get down on me knees, do ya?

21:39.080 --> 21:40.116
Kiss your fucking ring?

21:44.520 --> 21:45.920
I didn't tell you to stop packing.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.710
I got what I deserved.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.117
If I'd have stuck around,
I could've stopped him

22:38.200 --> 22:39.200
I could've shot him.

22:41.240 --> 22:44.480
If I hadn't done the job in the first place,
maybe none of this would've happened.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.156
He sneezed?

22:50.760 --> 22:52.433
Did he have hayfever? Allergies?

22:52.760 --> 22:54.353
What has that got to do with anything?

22:54.400 --> 22:56.756
You said he sneezed.
Now, why did he sneeze?

22:57.120 --> 22:58.120
I don't know.

22:58.800 --> 22:59.800
He had a cold.

23:01.920 --> 23:02.920
Of course...

23:05.240 --> 23:07.072
It's a highly contagious viral infection.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.635
You've had the strain of the cold virus
in your body during the operation.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.554
That triggers your immune system

23:13.600 --> 23:16.718
which releases antibodies
to fight the cold virus.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.431
The antibodies also inhibit
the vector surface proteins

23:21.040 --> 23:25.398
and the vector cannot enter
your cells and replicate...

23:38.760 --> 23:40.274

23:40.800 --> 23:43.793

24:04.120 --> 24:07.272
Looks like our guest from the South
decided to make an appearance.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.280
Brookeheath, eh?

24:36.080 --> 24:37.116
What you got in there?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.400
Gold? Frankincense?

24:41.560 --> 24:43.950
Something valuable, I'm guessing.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.760
Why else would you be needing a chopper?

25:08.040 --> 25:10.509
You know your back left indicator's out?

25:13.600 --> 25:16.240
I could fine you for that.
- You letting me through or not?

25:22.880 --> 25:23.880
Course I am.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.432
We're all on the same side, aren't we?

25:27.680 --> 25:29.319
You know where you're going, don't ya?

25:29.960 --> 25:31.076
Don't stray from the path.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.713
Can't be too careful round this way.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.976
You need to trust me, Michael.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.640
You're not going to London.
You and I are going back to Kiloran.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.633
The fuck!

26:14.720 --> 26:15.720
Shit!

26:23.520 --> 26:24.520
Fuck!

26:35.720 --> 26:37.200
Woah, woah, woah!

26:37.240 --> 26:39.152
Prom queen's got a gun.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.079
You're in no condition to be doing that.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.480
Keep moving.

26:54.400 --> 26:58.235
We can help ya.
- Yeah, yeah. I know how karma works.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.280
I burst a bunch of tyres

27:00.400 --> 27:02.676
and now mine's burst randomly
for no reason at all.

27:03.480 --> 27:06.200
I almost run you down
and now you want revenge.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.440
Au contraire.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.589
Au contraire, mademoiselle.

27:10.880 --> 27:15.352
You almost running us over blessed us
with a newfound appreciation for life.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.316
Ours, yours,
that little bundle you got in there...

27:20.200 --> 27:21.554
and changing your tyre

27:22.400 --> 27:24.232
would be the least we can do in return.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.560
Alright.

27:32.640 --> 27:33.960
Well, get out and change it then.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.272
Yep. Here we go.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.716
Keep your hands where I can see them.
- Jazz hands.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.056
Looks like... almost like a nail.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.280
That's close enough.
- Alright.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.320
Look, why don't you sit down
and let us do this?

27:52.360 --> 27:53.360
No.

27:53.760 --> 27:54.760
You want a massage?

27:57.160 --> 27:59.600
Look, I'd like to think I know
a little something about crazy.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
No shit.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.071
You're, what - 36, 37 weeks along?

28:05.400 --> 28:06.400
Thirty eight.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.597
Honey, you gotta get yourself to a hospital.

28:09.360 --> 28:10.430
I'm a doctor, trust me.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.000
People do natural birthing all the time.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.636
Yeah, not in moving cars.
- What's the alternative?

28:17.160 --> 28:18.640
Miss out on the race and stay here?

28:19.360 --> 28:23.070
Raise a child in a world
where there are monsters and curfews

28:23.120 --> 28:25.476
and people who will do anything to survive?

28:26.920 --> 28:28.115
I'd rather take the risk.

28:29.080 --> 28:31.390
Come with us, let us look after you.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.720
So the secret, Cheese...

28:33.840 --> 28:36.674
is you grab the shaft with both hands
and then you tickle the nuts.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.080
That way it stays on, you see.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.393
Why you gotta say things like that, man?

28:42.480 --> 28:43.480
All done.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.111
Well done, son.

28:45.160 --> 28:47.120
Watch out, man's coming through
on a wheelie ting.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.320
I'm doing this on my own.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.520
Come on, now.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.355
No matter who you are

28:55.880 --> 28:59.920
or what you do to live, thrive or survive

29:00.880 --> 29:02.553
there's some things...
- Oh!

29:02.600 --> 29:03.795
...that make us all the same.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.320

29:54.880 --> 29:55.880
Ooh!

30:07.480 --> 30:08.800
I need to get after Michael.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.516
Manchester's rough.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.560
We're coming with you.

30:12.040 --> 30:13.110
Look, it's alright.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.075
Roman told us how important Michael is.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.200
I really appreciate your help

30:20.000 --> 30:21.195
but you've both got families.

30:21.240 --> 30:23.197
You should be concentrating on
winning the race

30:23.240 --> 30:24.390
not taking any more risks.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.553
Your sister died saving us.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.074
I don't forget stuff like that.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.393
It's what separates us from the mooks

30:36.920 --> 30:39.230
sacrifice, altruism and guts.

30:42.280 --> 30:46.320
We're all in this race
cos we wanna get out of this shit.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.920
What's the point in winning if we lose
everything that matters?

30:53.560 --> 30:54.789
From what Roman says

30:55.280 --> 30:58.671
saving Michael will stop another family
losing someone they love.

31:01.280 --> 31:04.159
I'd say that's a chance worth taking,
wouldn't you?

31:07.400 --> 31:08.675
But once we get Michael back

31:09.520 --> 31:10.556
the gloves are off again.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.310
Every team for themselves.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.400
Agreed?

31:16.400 --> 31:17.800
I wouldn't have it any other way.

31:21.520 --> 31:22.520
Thank you.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.354
Word of advice, junior...

31:26.880 --> 31:27.916
If you're a boy

31:28.880 --> 31:31.759
don't make the mistake of thinking
you can solve every girl's problems.

31:32.400 --> 31:36.235
And if you're a girl, don't expect a man
to fix everything for you.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.639
Wow. That is incredibly profound, y'know.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.752
Cos, like, even though I'm a boy

31:44.080 --> 31:46.640
I think maybe I do expect men
to fix things for me.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.310
Don't get me wrong,
I'm good with electrical things.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.879
But, like, plumbing,
I really struggle with that shit.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.274
And plants, anything to do
with plants actually, I don't like plants.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.959
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

32:00.200 --> 32:02.351
Thought maybe
I could be your birthing partner, innit.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.760
What do you know about birthing?

32:05.280 --> 32:07.590
Right, when the rumour of the mooks
first started, yeah

32:07.680 --> 32:09.637
my sister was eight months pregnant.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.430
I was stuck with her for three weeks, mans,
just the two of us, no escape.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.556
You delivered her baby?

32:18.720 --> 32:21.792
No, man, that's my sister!
I don't want to see all that.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.033
We just watched loads of <i>Call The Midwife.</i>

32:26.000 --> 32:28.993
Let me tell you this -
giving birth is actually a piece of piss.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.520
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.360
This music is good, y'know.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.116
Very ambient.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.912
Very relaxing, actually. What is it?

32:43.720 --> 32:44.720
It's whale song.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.037
Whales...? Fishes can't sing.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.520
They're not fish. They're mammals.

32:51.920 --> 32:54.560
I never knew that.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.880
Here's me thinking
I was gonna help you out, innit. Haha!

33:01.440 --> 33:03.318
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.716
Whenever we had to move freight after dark

33:06.760 --> 33:09.320
it was always Officer Darby
who sorted it for us.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.280
Boss!

33:17.280 --> 33:18.280
Hi.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.314
Alright, Lou Lou.

33:24.360 --> 33:27.751
Aren't you supposed to be
representing us in the Wacky Races?

33:29.160 --> 33:30.594
Yeah. Detour.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.920
We need to get after that truck
you just let through.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.190
Yeah? Why's that then?

33:35.280 --> 33:36.960
It's got my friend Michael inside it.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.271
Is he sick or something?
- No.

33:39.720 --> 33:40.949
Then why would Brookeheath

33:41.040 --> 33:43.600
want to airlift him out of here
in the middle of the night?

33:43.640 --> 33:45.856
Airlift him from where?
- Why the fuck should I tell you?

33:45.880 --> 33:48.315
Come on, Darby.
- Don't "come on, Darby" me.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.200
You're asking me to break the curfew.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.111
I should arrest you just for being out here.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.040
Go on then.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.594
Yeah, you're not going to, are you?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.310
Because if you were going to,
you'd have done it already

34:14.360 --> 34:15.360
so stop dicking about.

34:17.760 --> 34:18.989
Listen, I get it, right?

34:19.800 --> 34:21.120
I'm a businesswoman

34:21.400 --> 34:23.277
I know you're holding out for a price

34:24.000 --> 34:25.116
so how about this?

34:25.440 --> 34:27.556
You said they're being airlifted
out of here, right?

34:28.199 --> 34:30.157
Yeah.
- Right. You radio ahead.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.513
You tell 'em there's a security breach
and they need to redirect

34:34.000 --> 34:35.036
via my factory.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.795
Then you let us through,
and when we've done what we need to

34:39.239 --> 34:40.594
you get to keep the factory.

34:46.199 --> 34:48.396
Sue and I bought it when Salford
was on its arse.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.840
The machinery alone's worth
a few hundred thousand now.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.559
We're racing to win or we die trying.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.959
Either way, we're not coming back.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.200
Welcome to Manchester.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.880
Know where you're going, don't ya?

35:48.360 --> 35:50.240
- Everyone know what they're doing?
- Yeah.

35:50.560 --> 35:53.917
We're picking a fight with a private security
psycho and a couple of dirty cops.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.194
Yeah, well, we've got the numbers

35:57.320 --> 35:58.595
and we're on home turf.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.793
Here, take my spare.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.240
Let's do this.

36:13.720 --> 36:14.720
We're here.

36:15.480 --> 36:16.480
Get out of the truck.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.360
Is there a problem?

36:26.640 --> 36:27.640
Where's the helicopter?

36:29.080 --> 36:30.400
That's what I wanna know.

36:31.680 --> 36:32.875
Get your boss on the radio.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.200
Something wrong?

36:41.160 --> 36:42.389
You redirected us.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.551
The chopper was supposed to be here
when we arrived.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.120
Where is it?

36:46.960 --> 36:49.236
<i>Do I sound like
one of those fellas landing planes</i>

36:49.280 --> 36:50.634
<i>with a couple of ping pong bats?</i>

36:50.760 --> 36:51.955
Put your weapons down.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.360
Ladies first.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.121
OK, so this would qualify
as a "Mexican stand-off".

37:15.480 --> 37:17.960
The balance of powers between the two sides
appear to be equal.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.556
Well, that obviously changes things.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.193
Michael cannot go back to Brookeheath.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.550
Kaye, I'm on your side.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.718
You should stick to the microscope.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.400
That means we're back where we were.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.440
Roman, stop talking.

37:40.960 --> 37:41.960
OK.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.634
Someone needs to get the keys.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.200
The keys...?

37:54.360 --> 37:56.875
Oh, right. OK.

38:03.440 --> 38:04.680
I don't care who else you shoot

38:05.680 --> 38:07.319
but you touch my son and I'll kill you.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.189
Hey.
- Hey.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.120
You alright?

38:48.080 --> 38:49.080
Yeah.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.756
You two head for the cars. We'll follow on.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.200
And if he follows?

39:00.080 --> 39:01.080
He won't.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.159
Is there room for a little one?

39:05.120 --> 39:08.238
This is my factory now.
Ain't that right, Lou Lou?

39:10.320 --> 39:12.915
Doesn't mean you have to behave like a dick.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.992
Now, now. Deal's a deal.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.069
And that means everything in here
belongs to me

39:19.960 --> 39:21.030
including him.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.710
And I'm guessing you've gotta be worth
a few quid

39:24.760 --> 39:27.036
for everyone to be going to this much
trouble over you.

39:28.080 --> 39:32.154
So why don't you all
just put down your guns

39:32.720 --> 39:34.040
leave him with me...

39:34.400 --> 39:36.232
and piss off out

39:37.400 --> 39:38.800
or the kid gets it.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.236
We've got to do it, Kaye.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.709
Absolutely not.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.240
Michael is a valuable medical asset.
- I don't care!

39:47.400 --> 39:48.436
Hold on, Mum.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.439
If everyone put down their guns
then Robocop gets a free shot at Kaye

39:51.720 --> 39:54.280
and anyone else he wants.
- Which one's Robocop?

39:57.240 --> 39:59.080
Why don't we just take him out
of the equation?

39:59.520 --> 40:01.876
- But then we lose Michael to Darby.
- Fuck Michael.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.320
Put down your guns.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.392
Can everyone just put down your guns?

40:12.560 --> 40:13.560
Put down your guns!

40:15.320 --> 40:17.516
- I'm not that important, Mum.
- Yes, you are!

40:18.800 --> 40:20.951
Everyone, just put down your guns.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.516
Woah, woah, woah!

40:24.480 --> 40:25.480
What are you doing?

40:25.800 --> 40:26.960
I'm what this is all about...

40:28.520 --> 40:29.520
right?

40:30.840 --> 40:32.274
All of you are here because of me.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.957
So how about we take me out of the equation?

40:36.560 --> 40:39.837
You can all just get back to the job -
the race

40:41.280 --> 40:42.475
and get on with your lives.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.234
Michael, you're too important.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.760
With what we know now,
we could find a vaccine.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.640
So you've got all you need.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.635
No, I need to run a whole new set of tests
on your immune system.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.236
You're a smart guy.

40:55.560 --> 40:56.560
You'll figure it out.

40:57.240 --> 40:58.240
No.

41:00.960 --> 41:01.960
No.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.879
I can't keep letting people die
because of me.

41:07.760 --> 41:08.760
The world needs you.

41:10.480 --> 41:11.480
I need you.

41:13.520 --> 41:14.520
That's why we're here.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.829
And to save the world.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.160
Sixty-forty.

41:31.960 --> 41:32.960
Move, Roman.

41:33.440 --> 41:34.440
Move.

41:41.640 --> 41:44.758
Well, that load of bollocks
puts us back to square one, doesn't it?

41:46.040 --> 41:48.157
Except it doesn't, cos I miscalculated.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.034
Stop moving your bonce.

41:51.640 --> 41:52.756
Get down!

42:17.800 --> 42:18.800
Is he dead?

42:30.960 --> 42:31.960
Yeah.

42:37.920 --> 42:38.920
Nice shooting!

42:41.480 --> 42:42.516
Meg, you alright?

42:42.720 --> 42:44.996
I think I might need
some medical assistance...

42:45.880 --> 42:46.880
Come here.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.319
You OK?

42:52.200 --> 42:54.078
It's the strangest feeling.

42:55.520 --> 42:58.399
It's like falling backwards in slow motion...

42:59.360 --> 43:00.680
Let's get him to the ambulance.

43:04.320 --> 43:07.040
Cleaner's gonna have the right hump
when she comes in in the morning.

43:08.640 --> 43:11.030
Alright, let's get racing.
