01:03.604 --> 01:05.848
92 degrees... God!

01:17.449 --> 01:21.366
I want a drink but I can't
be bothered to get up...

01:21.367 --> 01:24.316
I wanna go to the loo but I can't be
bothered to go down the corridor...

01:25.717 --> 01:27.979
This is one of the universal dilemmas,

01:29.280 --> 01:32.593
something which has confronted all
men since the beginning of time...

01:34.094 --> 01:37.000
to pee or not to pee...
that is the question.

01:38.786 --> 01:43.205
No, I'll just lie here, really
thirsty, with a full bladder,

01:44.566 --> 01:45.600
and try and get to sleep.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.600
Smeggin 'ell!

01:56.426 --> 02:01.002
One more time, and you
get this. D'you hear?

02:01.653 --> 02:06.003
Don't think I don't mean it!
One more time, just one more.

02:10.420 --> 02:14.072
What did I tell you? I
told you! Didn't I tell you?

02:14.073 --> 02:18.426
How many times have I told you?
Right, what was the last one?

02:20.422 --> 02:24.512
'Nureek'. So the next
one will be a 'retut',

02:24.513 --> 02:26.712
and the one after that
will be a 'hanunga'.

02:28.013 --> 02:32.420
Four seconds; three
seconds; two seconds...

02:34.314 --> 02:35.114
Now 'hanunga'...

02:39.509 --> 02:44.114
No, that's wrong! You've gone out of
sequence! 'Nureek', 'retut', 'hanunga'

02:44.115 --> 02:45.708
What's wrong with you?

02:48.510 --> 02:50.509
If you're gonna keep me up all
night just do it right, okay?!?

02:54.509 --> 02:58.508
'Squrlookal'? Where does
'squrlookal' come from? It's new!

03:04.518 --> 03:07.509
Phew, that's better. Kill
two birds with one shower.

03:17.082 --> 03:20.332
Okay... right, right.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.700
I can't hear you.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.465
You can do whatever you like,

03:29.466 --> 03:31.073
I can't hear a damn thing.

03:55.081 --> 04:00.072
Oh my goodness. It's Princess Leia.
Luke Skywalker went that way, ma'am.

04:01.974 --> 04:02.674
What?

04:03.077 --> 04:05.076
It's nearly 9am, ma'am,
what are you doing up?

04:05.111 --> 04:07.076
Looking for someone to kill,
care to volunteer?

04:07.111 --> 04:08.072
Oh, can't sleep?

04:09.075 --> 04:11.626
Have you ever listened to
those clapped-out old pipes?

04:11.627 --> 04:12.879
'Nureek'ing and 'retut'ing,

04:12.880 --> 04:16.077
and just when you expect them to
'nureek' again, they 'squrlookal'!

04:17.070 --> 04:19.072
It's enough to make a
perfectly sane person crazy!

04:21.071 --> 04:23.261
It's quite amazing, the
number of people those pipes

04:23.262 --> 04:25.079
have driven to the
very brink of psychosis.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.836
Mr Lister spent the night in there once,

04:26.837 --> 04:29.869
and he ended up trying to suffocate
himself to death with an onion sandwich.

04:31.078 --> 04:35.605
Look at this. This is a boys fridge.
Women would never have fridges like this.

04:36.706 --> 04:38.069
Chilled trainers?
It just wouldn't happen!

04:40.072 --> 04:43.069
What would you say to a
glass of drinking chocolate?

04:44.070 --> 04:47.250
I'd say: "Glass of drinking
chocolate, get me out of here!"

04:49.051 --> 04:51.447
I can't live like this, I need a bath.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.690
I hate showers, I've
always hated showers.

04:53.691 --> 04:56.068
Ask anyone who knows me what I hate,
and do you know what they'll say?

04:59.136 --> 05:06.456
Where did it all go wrong?
My life started off so promisingly.

05:07.357 --> 05:11.494
Rich parents; good
school; pony named Trumper.

05:13.295 --> 05:14.634
How did I end up like this?

05:15.635 --> 05:17.893
On a ship where the
fourth most popular pastime

05:17.894 --> 05:21.232
is going down to the laundry room
and watching my knickers spin dry...

05:22.130 --> 05:24.336
Ma'am! That is not true!
No one has ever done that!

05:24.938 --> 05:26.858
That's only because they
don't know when you wash them!

05:27.259 --> 05:30.277
Couple of posters and a trailer before
'The World's Stupidest Stuntmen' video and,

05:30.278 --> 05:32.132
take it from me, that
laundry room will be packed!

05:32.567 --> 05:35.863
I think you're doing Mr Lister and
the Cat a great disservice, ma'am.

05:35.864 --> 05:37.135
A great, great disservice!

05:38.133 --> 05:41.131
Wow - this is the best load yet!

05:42.129 --> 05:45.606
Just for the record I'd like to repeat
that I'm only here because I can't sleep.

05:45.607 --> 05:48.139
So I decided to do some of my
laundry and help out Kryten.

05:48.174 --> 05:49.129
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

05:50.128 --> 05:52.069
I'm not here because I'm
a sad and lonely person

05:52.070 --> 05:54.129
who's entertained by women's
underwear spin drying.

05:55.129 --> 05:56.128
My god, a g-string!

05:56.163 --> 05:57.098
Where?

05:57.133 --> 06:01.128
You missed it... I swear! It was
black and really, really small.

06:02.128 --> 06:05.130
I'm too mature for this. I'm just
gonna sit here and read my comic.

06:06.129 --> 06:07.659
Oh buddy, this is a great show tonight.

06:07.660 --> 06:10.130
I may even write a fan letter
to the washing machine company.

06:11.129 --> 06:13.025
Sometimes I'm really
ashamed to be with you.

06:13.026 --> 06:15.132
You're completely out of
order, do you know that?

06:15.167 --> 06:17.099
Since when did you get so mature?

06:17.134 --> 06:19.128
Mature? I've been mature for ages, me.

06:20.128 --> 06:21.127
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

06:22.141 --> 06:24.619
You're just pretending to be
mature, because that's your plan

06:24.620 --> 06:27.136
to get officer Bud-Babe to fall
for you! Everybody knows that!

06:28.129 --> 06:29.132
Go and stick an egg up your nose.

06:30.129 --> 06:31.727
- It's true.
- Isn't true.

06:31.811 --> 06:34.817
- It is!
- Isn't!

06:35.816 --> 06:37.811
Sirs, sirs, sirs! What
are you arguing about?

06:38.146 --> 06:39.420
About me being really mature.

06:40.810 --> 06:41.813
What's come over you,
sir, why aren't you in bed?

06:42.811 --> 06:44.814
The heating system's gone
bonkers. Why, what's up?

06:45.206 --> 06:48.208
Oh, it appears life on board ship
is getting Miss Kochanski down, sir.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.176
What's the problem?

06:50.211 --> 06:52.327
It's not helped by the fact
that her sleeping quarters

06:52.328 --> 06:53.635
are next to the sewage processor.

06:53.636 --> 06:55.212
You know how noisy those pipes are, sir.

06:56.205 --> 06:57.171
We'll re-lag them first
thing in the mornin'.

06:57.206 --> 06:59.731
Oh it's not just she can't
sleep, sir, it's everything.

06:59.732 --> 07:02.211
Not being able to have a
bath, no cottage cheese, no...

07:05.196 --> 07:10.194
The thermostat! I swear I
set the correct programme!

07:11.193 --> 07:13.194
Oh! Who on earth is going
to tell her!? I mean, who -

07:21.195 --> 07:21.895
Hi.

07:23.198 --> 07:24.192
How're you settling in?

07:26.198 --> 07:28.194
Great. Having a ball.

07:28.893 --> 07:29.893
We'll fix those pipes...

07:31.194 --> 07:34.391
If you could just make them go 'nureek'
every time without any 'squirlookals',

07:34.392 --> 07:35.300
I'd be so grateful.

07:36.196 --> 07:37.197
We'll stop them completely.

07:38.195 --> 07:42.195
I know I've been spoilt! Brought up
in the trendiest part of Glasgow -

07:43.193 --> 07:44.197
Yeah, the Gorbals, you said.

07:44.826 --> 07:45.818
Now I can't even have a bath...

07:47.819 --> 07:50.821
Come on. Come with me. I've
got something to show you.

07:56.817 --> 07:59.817
You take my quarters
tonight, and I'll have yours.

08:00.822 --> 08:02.815
I've cleaned out an old retro
housing and filled it with water.

08:03.814 --> 08:04.816
I don't know what to say...

08:06.817 --> 08:08.815
And I, erm... found this on that derelict...

08:09.817 --> 08:10.817
I was savin' it for your birthday.

08:12.817 --> 08:13.819
There's some make-up in there, too.

08:22.814 --> 08:24.821
I can't find her anywhere, sir,
I've been searching high and low!

08:26.816 --> 08:27.813
Oh! Ma'am. Didn't spot you, there.

08:28.818 --> 08:30.813
Krissie's sleeping in my
quarters tonight, Kryten.

08:30.848 --> 08:31.789
In, your quarters, sir?

08:31.824 --> 08:33.815
Yeah, she's gonna have a nice, hot bath.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.823
In here? Without clothes on?

08:37.813 --> 08:39.816
Well, all convention
dictates probably, yeah.

08:44.818 --> 08:46.657
Kryten, me and Kris
have been having a talk,

08:46.658 --> 08:48.823
and we think it'd be better
all 'round if you leave.

08:49.524 --> 08:50.524
Er, sir?

08:50.813 --> 08:52.766
As you probably know, we're
planning on settling down together,

08:52.767 --> 08:54.811
it started that night she had a
bath in my quarters, you remember?

08:57.812 --> 08:58.812
We got you this leaving present...

09:01.816 --> 09:02.779
A key-ring -

09:02.814 --> 09:03.812
With a 'C' on it.

09:03.847 --> 09:04.811
For 'Kryten'!

09:05.815 --> 09:06.782
But, you spell 'Kryten' with a 'K'...

09:06.817 --> 09:10.817
Ohh, don't make a fuss. Now, I've packed
all your heads; they're in the bag.

09:15.813 --> 09:18.892
You know what it's like, man, it's
the fourth Law of the universe:

09:19.293 --> 09:21.912
you settle down with a woman,
and the first thing they do

09:22.013 --> 09:24.610
is systematically set about getting
rid of all your mates. The Cat's next.

09:25.114 --> 09:26.787
I've been packing his
bag for over three weeks!

09:26.822 --> 09:29.516
See, we wanna be a proper couple,
have lots of dinner parties,

09:29.517 --> 09:32.809
and I think I've reached the age now
where I really should be wearing clogs.

09:33.813 --> 09:35.434
And you see we're all
a bit embarrassed of you

09:35.435 --> 09:36.814
because you've got a funny shaped head.

09:37.811 --> 09:38.814
You're not human, are you, you're a robot.

09:39.819 --> 09:40.810
- Yeah!
- Eeeugh!

09:42.808 --> 09:43.813
Oh hi! You're early, come in!

09:44.813 --> 09:45.812
Good to see you!

09:58.668 --> 10:00.679
I've just seen the future!

10:01.669 --> 10:04.668
I'm afraid Mr Lister shrunk your uniform,
ma'am. You only have one left, now.

10:05.371 --> 10:06.371
Did he? Never mind.

10:06.669 --> 10:07.637
Aren't you mad?

10:07.672 --> 10:10.666
I'm too tired to be mad... I just want
to have my bath, and get some sleep.

10:12.669 --> 10:15.667
Right. I'll be going then. Going.
After all these years, I'll be going.

10:16.673 --> 10:17.634
Are you all right, Kryts?

10:17.669 --> 10:19.244
Never been better, thank you, sir.

10:19.245 --> 10:22.673
A key-ring with a 'C' on it!
Unbelievable! Thank you with a capital 'R'!

10:24.667 --> 10:25.633
What's eating him?

10:25.668 --> 10:26.669
I dunno - I'll find out later.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.665
Thanks for this, I really appreciate it.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.165
- Hey, no bother.
- See you in the morning.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.667
That's right. Well, I'll be going then?

10:38.665 --> 10:39.465
Yeah. 'Night.

10:39.665 --> 10:42.299
- Right, I'll... I'll go...
- Yeah.

10:42.334 --> 10:43.298
See you tomorrow.

10:43.333 --> 10:46.141
Tomorrow! Right. If you need anyone
to, um, scrub your back or anything,

10:46.142 --> 10:48.333
don't hesitate to call, I
can be here in twenty seconds.

10:49.350 --> 10:50.633
- I won't.
- Right then.

10:51.332 --> 10:52.332
'Night. Goodnight.

10:56.332 --> 10:57.331
What was that?

10:58.335 --> 11:00.333
Hang on a minute, I've
got a torch somewhere...

11:05.339 --> 11:06.298
What the hell's happenin'?

11:06.633 --> 11:08.087
The generator's down, sir.

11:08.188 --> 11:10.439
I was just adjusting the
thermo-settings and it overloaded.

11:10.940 --> 11:12.930
Give it a few seconds and the
emergency backup will kick in.

11:14.332 --> 11:15.333
Ah, thank goodness.

11:20.331 --> 11:21.333
I'll look into it immediately, sir!

11:25.334 --> 11:27.331
There goes the backup! Now everythin's dead.

11:27.366 --> 11:28.330
How come the doors closed?

11:29.333 --> 11:31.511
When the backup goes down
the doors always lock;

11:31.512 --> 11:33.334
prevent fire, re-inforce
hull integrity.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.341
So what's steering this
crate? Is autopilot down too?

11:37.330 --> 11:39.305
Everything's down. Oh, I
wish I'd been more careful!

11:39.340 --> 11:42.218
You mean this ship's careening
out of control through space

11:42.219 --> 11:44.329
with absolutely zero
expertise at the helm?

11:44.364 --> 11:45.329
No change there, then.

11:47.328 --> 11:49.296
We've got to re-fire the backup generator.

11:49.331 --> 11:51.337
The only way to get to the backup
is through the service ducts.

11:52.330 --> 11:56.692
Two miles of ventways that wind their
way through the ship like intestines.

11:56.693 --> 11:58.026
There should be a hatchway
in your shower, sir.

11:58.330 --> 11:59.331
How long's that gonna take?

11:59.366 --> 12:00.332
Oh, six hours, maybe more?

12:00.367 --> 12:01.294
Six hours?

12:01.829 --> 12:02.727
Are you okay, sir?

12:03.327 --> 12:05.338
Fine, yeah. Yep, yep.

12:08.330 --> 12:10.187
The reading said last night
that there was gonna be

12:10.188 --> 12:11.651
a meteor storm coming in directly ahead,

12:12.052 --> 12:14.230
but it won't hit us for
at least twelve hours.

12:14.329 --> 12:15.699
We should gather up some supplies.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.574
A little food, as much
water as we can carry,

12:17.575 --> 12:19.325
and maybe even that
magnetic fishing game.

12:23.398 --> 12:24.385
Okay, let's go.

12:40.387 --> 12:42.267
It's so damn hot I can barely breathe!

12:43.268 --> 12:46.284
It's like being stuck in a sauna
with a fat man on your face!

12:46.383 --> 12:49.382
I don't feel so good...
the walls are closing in!

12:50.084 --> 12:51.184
Are you okay, sir?

12:51.382 --> 12:52.347
I need to take a break - I need air!

12:52.382 --> 12:54.387
He's claustrophobic, didn't you guys know?

12:55.391 --> 12:57.330
I'm all right when I know I can get out,

12:57.331 --> 13:00.383
but now we're out in the middle
somewhere... Can't breathe...

13:00.418 --> 13:01.384
Have a drink, sir.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.516
Okay, take a look around, see if we
can unscrew one of the ceiling hatches;

13:05.517 --> 13:07.084
drop back down into the ship somewhere.

13:07.889 --> 13:09.189
Let's go.

13:10.379 --> 13:11.382
M' throat's closin'... chokin'...

13:12.380 --> 13:15.382
Here, drink some of this. You just
need something to take your mind off it.

13:17.386 --> 13:20.385
I wonder why Dave, my Dave,
wasn't claustrophobic?

13:21.382 --> 13:23.154
Oh thanks, Kris, that's really helpin'.

13:24.155 --> 13:26.380
Now is not a great time to tell me
how great your boyfriend is, okay?

13:27.380 --> 13:29.388
He wasn't my boyfriend. Not really.

13:29.423 --> 13:30.351
What?

13:30.386 --> 13:31.379
No, we were just good friends.

13:32.380 --> 13:33.349
No, but you said -

13:33.384 --> 13:36.133
I just didn't want to look like
some sad loser when we first met,

13:37.134 --> 13:38.483
so I asked him to play along.

13:38.581 --> 13:39.682
You weren't going out with him?

13:40.817 --> 13:41.681
He wasn't my type.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.698
But, he was well-dressed,
neat, sophisticated, sensitive;

13:45.699 --> 13:48.380
you're so damn picky!
Why wasn't he your type?

13:49.384 --> 13:50.184
He was gay.

13:50.380 --> 13:54.403
You see? Picky. Everythin's got to
be absolutely perfect before you're...

13:54.404 --> 13:55.382
What did you say?

13:56.379 --> 13:58.182
- He was gay.
- Gay?

13:58.378 --> 13:59.078
Yes.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.380
Are you sayin' I'm... I'm gay
in an alternative dimension?

14:01.615 --> 14:03.344
- Yes.
- Me?

14:03.379 --> 14:05.113
That's why we only dated
for a couple of weeks;

14:05.614 --> 14:07.990
it was sort of his final attempt
at trying to work things out.

14:09.179 --> 14:15.757
Wait a minute... you don't think... now
hang on, I'm completely straight, okay?

14:16.358 --> 14:17.692
I couldn't possibly be gay.

14:18.593 --> 14:22.381
I can't grow a big moustache for
starters, it just grows in little clumps...

14:22.757 --> 14:24.444
Here, have another drink - heteroboy.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.003
We've found a grill about
twenty meters down on the right,

14:31.004 --> 14:32.562
which drops down into a supply room.

14:32.563 --> 14:35.356
We can't get through to unscrew
the fastening bolts but, ma'am,

14:35.357 --> 14:37.451
with smaller hands you
might enjoy better luck.

14:38.054 --> 14:39.849
- Will you be okay?
- Leave him to me.

14:40.448 --> 14:41.457
I'll be okay.

14:55.489 --> 14:57.032
Boy, is it cramped! Whew-ew!

14:58.333 --> 15:01.795
I tell you, if I was dead you most
certainly could not swing me around in here!

15:02.489 --> 15:04.493
- Cat...
- Talk about cooped up!

15:04.528 --> 15:05.491
Cat!

15:06.499 --> 15:09.488
Oh, sorry... not supposed
to talk about that, right?

15:09.523 --> 15:10.223
Right.

15:15.643 --> 15:16.610
So how do you get to be claustrophobic?

15:17.245 --> 15:20.973
I was seventeen, working in the
MegaMart, part time, as a trolley-parker.

15:22.974 --> 15:25.877
After a couple of months I fell
in love with cashier number four...

15:26.878 --> 15:30.627
She was 22,
come-to-behind-the-bacon-counter eyes...

15:31.628 --> 15:34.347
And there was just something about
the way she held her pricing gun

15:34.348 --> 15:35.742
that made me crash m' trolleys.

15:37.643 --> 15:40.653
We started seeing each other, in
the stock room, at break time...

15:42.496 --> 15:45.495
She gave you claustrophobia? I didn't
think you could get it like that...

15:47.505 --> 15:49.241
One evening, we were
both on the late shift;

15:49.242 --> 15:53.238
we snuck into the stock room; started
makin' love on a box of tinned asparagus.

15:54.239 --> 15:57.233
After a couple of minutes, about
half way through, I was seventeen,

15:57.934 --> 15:59.722
she leapt up and said:
"There's someone at the door!",

15:59.723 --> 16:01.967
so I jumped into this wooden
packing crate; it was 'im!

16:02.868 --> 16:05.625
He asked what the hell she
was doing lying on a box

16:05.626 --> 16:08.117
of reduced, tinned,
dented veg with no kit on.

16:09.618 --> 16:11.820
She said she was trying to get an
all-over tan from the lightbulb.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.335
He was havin' none of that.

16:14.236 --> 16:15.718
He sealed me up in the box and said

16:15.719 --> 16:18.216
he was gonna drop me in the
canal, he drove me out there!

16:18.617 --> 16:22.770
I was screamin' at him, pleadin':
"let me out!"; promised him anything,

16:22.771 --> 16:24.582
said I'd never see her
again, just let me out!

16:25.883 --> 16:29.163
In the end, he relented, and
I heard the box being opened.

16:30.464 --> 16:34.250
I stepped out, bollock
naked, right in the middle

16:34.251 --> 16:37.400
of the Bootle-players' amateur production
of "The Importance Of Being Earnest"...

16:39.593 --> 16:40.590
Boy, that's enough to freak anyone out!

16:42.594 --> 16:45.589
I had no idea Mr Lister was
claustrophobic; why did he never mention it?

16:46.590 --> 16:48.592
Well, it's probably not something
he feels comfortable talking about.

16:49.589 --> 16:50.593
He's told me about everything
else about his life...

16:51.594 --> 16:52.588
Not everything, Kryten.

16:52.623 --> 16:53.594
Absolutely, ma'am!

16:54.589 --> 16:55.552
Everything?

16:55.587 --> 16:58.092
Mmm. Before you arrived,
nights were long and dull.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.197
'Cheese slice snap' can
only entertain for so long.

17:01.586 --> 17:02.591
So... what did he tell you about me?

17:03.590 --> 17:06.589
Oh, absolutely everything, ma'am. I
don't think he missed a single detail.

17:06.625 --> 17:07.517
What way?

17:07.551 --> 17:08.553
I've seen the way!

17:08.588 --> 17:09.521
What way?

17:09.556 --> 17:12.518
Like he's a pot of cottage
cheese with pineapple chunks in!

17:12.553 --> 17:14.727
How could you say that?

17:15.328 --> 17:20.553
Maybe, once or twice, plain cottage
cheese. Never. Never! Have I?

17:26.555 --> 17:27.551
What's that?

17:28.355 --> 17:29.255
What's what?

17:29.549 --> 17:33.554
Can't you hear it yet?
Like a... roaring noise...

17:35.954 --> 17:36.854
A roaring noise?

17:37.564 --> 17:39.567
Like a... watery kind of roaring noise...

17:40.564 --> 17:41.563
I can't hear a thing.

17:43.575 --> 17:47.216
It's like water roaring
down, say, a passageway.

17:48.517 --> 17:52.566
In a kind of roaring, watery kind
of way. I wonder what the hell it is!

17:53.571 --> 17:54.562
Hey, where're you goin'?

17:55.565 --> 17:57.565
Kris! Kryten! Re-cyc water!

17:58.565 --> 17:59.561
Every four hours the
ductways get backwashed!

18:00.563 --> 18:04.166
You know what? I think I just solved
the watery roaring noise problem.

18:04.201 --> 18:05.562
- Come on!
- I ain't goin' wit' you!

18:05.797 --> 18:06.530
Why not?

18:06.565 --> 18:10.921
That's where the water's coming from.

18:12.922 --> 18:15.561
You can be really dumb
sometimes, you know that?

18:28.566 --> 18:30.559
I hate this, I really hate this!

18:40.562 --> 18:41.560
What's that?

18:41.595 --> 18:43.359
- What's what?
- That noise...

18:43.559 --> 18:47.565
Oh, not again! What noise? Is it
a roaring, watery kind of noise?

18:47.600 --> 18:50.558
No, not that noise. This is
a different kind of noise.

18:51.569 --> 18:54.015
Is it a kind of 'Cat
being smacked on the head

18:54.016 --> 18:56.565
by a smegged-off Lister's
fist' kind of noise..?

18:57.562 --> 19:04.568
It's a sort of... swirly... windy... ah...
water-drying, hurricaney kind of noise!

19:05.559 --> 19:10.399
A swirly, windy, water-drying,
hurricaney kind of noise?

19:11.500 --> 19:14.560
The dryer! The vents get
dried after a backwash!

19:17.568 --> 19:18.558
Here it comes...

19:31.562 --> 19:33.564
I am not having a good day!

19:36.561 --> 19:38.561
This should help, sir;
take away the rising panic.

19:39.096 --> 19:39.924
What is it?

19:40.259 --> 19:42.246
There was a first aid
box in the supply store.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.556
Lemo-plathenamine-cathorolite.

19:46.556 --> 19:47.559
Well done, ma'am.

19:57.553 --> 19:59.961
According to my reckoning we should
be halfway across B-deck by now.

20:00.559 --> 20:04.559
Boy, is this place hot! Satan
could come here on his winter break!

20:05.553 --> 20:09.981
Hang on, how come it's getting hotter
when the generators have packed in?

20:11.282 --> 20:12.554
It should be gettin'
colder, shouldn't it?

20:13.557 --> 20:15.618
Ma'am, that meteor storm you
said we were heading towards,

20:15.619 --> 20:17.061
which direction was it in?

20:17.554 --> 20:19.455
- Dead ahead.
- Oh! Anything else in the vacinity?

20:19.556 --> 20:21.555
To the west there is a
sun, but that's about it.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.592
I think we've been knocked off course!

20:24.093 --> 20:26.744
Probably due to the initial impact
of the generators going down.

20:26.745 --> 20:29.558
I think we're heading straight into
that sun! And it's all my fault!

20:29.593 --> 20:30.551
Kryten, man, it's not your fault...

20:30.586 --> 20:31.553
It is!

20:32.555 --> 20:35.553
It isn't! You were just adjusting
the thermosettings and it overloaded.

20:36.552 --> 20:39.496
I did it on purpose... I
typed in the override code,

20:39.497 --> 20:41.551
on the access panel in the corridor.

20:41.586 --> 20:42.558
What?

20:43.551 --> 20:47.054
I don't know what to say, I didn't
realise it would be so dangerous!

20:47.556 --> 20:48.550
Kryten, man, what made you do it?

20:49.553 --> 20:50.553
I really can't remember...

20:51.556 --> 20:52.553
What do you mean, 'you can't remember'?

20:53.554 --> 20:55.551
I'd really, rather not say it out
loud... might sound a bit silly...

20:56.255 --> 20:56.955
Say it...

20:58.562 --> 21:00.783
I didn't want you to have a bath, ma'am.

21:03.084 --> 21:05.955
Well, I knew it would be one
of those 'no clothes' baths,

21:05.956 --> 21:07.787
and Mr Lister would scrub your back,

21:07.788 --> 21:09.521
and before we know what's going on,

21:09.522 --> 21:12.566
he's wearing clogs and you're
having GELFs around to dinner.

21:12.567 --> 21:16.160
And what would happen to me?
I'd have been on my own again!

21:16.477 --> 21:17.276
Oh, Kryten..!

21:17.680 --> 21:19.682
I - was - just - so - scared!

21:20.677 --> 21:23.689
Come on, we've got no time to waste,
let's get the hell out of here!

21:23.724 --> 21:24.679
But we're not going to make it, sir!

21:24.714 --> 21:25.677
Yes we are!

21:25.712 --> 21:26.642
How?

21:26.677 --> 21:27.680
Catch some surf!

21:29.676 --> 21:30.643
Okay, here it comes...

21:30.678 --> 21:32.176
Tell me again, how do you 'hang ten'?

21:32.211 --> 21:33.674
Just get into position! Here it -

21:35.676 --> 21:38.679
AAAARRRRGGHH!

22:08.679 --> 22:10.673
Oh! Thank god we made it!

22:12.679 --> 22:14.672
Oh God!

22:27.684 --> 22:28.682
How? How?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.677
I - er - I - ah - er...

22:33.676 --> 22:34.671
Oh.

22:36.680 --> 22:37.983
Well, that's it. We're fried.

22:37.984 --> 22:40.635
Unless someone's got some
really terrific sunblock cream.

22:40.670 --> 22:45.543
Not necessarily, ma'am. I excluded
the doors from the shutdown override.

22:45.544 --> 22:47.679
In case... anything happened...

22:49.672 --> 22:52.421
You mean we spent the night
crawling through one end of this ship

22:52.422 --> 22:54.670
to God knows where and back
for absolutely no reason?

22:54.705 --> 22:57.769
It was all pointless? You
put me through that nightmare

22:57.770 --> 23:00.668
when we could just walk
out that door at any moment?

23:00.703 --> 23:01.670
Mm.

23:02.678 --> 23:05.956
Well, if you'll excuse us, we've
got some serious reversing to do,

23:05.957 --> 23:09.675
but we'll talk about this, over a cup
of coffee, and a hot branding iron...

23:13.668 --> 23:14.668
Well, 'night.

23:15.670 --> 23:16.674
Aren't you mad too, ma'am?

23:18.370 --> 23:19.570
You're not, are you.

23:19.679 --> 23:23.868
I think I understand: For you, the trip
through the ducts was far from pointless.

23:23.869 --> 23:26.218
It was an emotional
journey where you gleaned

23:26.219 --> 23:28.312
invaluable insights into your crewmates.

23:28.313 --> 23:32.347
This was your 'rites of passage', you
feel enriched, wiser, and somehow bonded

23:32.348 --> 23:35.667
by this in a way that... you
never thought possible. Am I right?

23:36.668 --> 23:38.767
- Say 'nureek'.
- 'Nureek'.

23:40.255 --> 23:41.551
- Say 'retut'.
- 'Retut'.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.454
- Say 'hanunga'.
- Er, 'hanunga'.

23:44.253 --> 23:45.403
- 'Nureek'.
- 'Nureek'.

23:45.438 --> 23:46.553
- 'Retut'.
- 'Retut'.

23:46.788 --> 23:47.752
- 'Hanunga'.
- 'Hanunga'.

23:48.255 --> 23:49.262
- 'Squirlookal'
- 'Squirlookal'

23:49.297 --> 23:50.752
- 'Retut'.
- Oohh! 'Retut'.

23:51.253 --> 23:52.253
- 'Nureek'.
- Ooh! 'Nureek'.

23:52.288 --> 23:53.654
- 'Hanunga'.
- 'Hanunga'.
