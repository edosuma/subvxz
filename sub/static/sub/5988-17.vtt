WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.636
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
Our mission is to blow up
the Red Knights' stockpile.

00:07.475 --> 00:08.607
Something's wrong.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.110
Get the king back to the castle!

00:11.112 --> 00:12.478
CHARLES:
<i> The Red Knights got on to us.</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:14.313
Thierry, run!

00:14.315 --> 00:15.314
You're a traitor.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.749
You mean nothing.

00:16.751 --> 00:18.183
I am your husband.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.385
I am going to England

00:19.387 --> 00:20.652
at Queen Elizabeth's request.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.054
When we make land in Scotland,

00:22.056 --> 00:23.255
we both go our separate ways.

00:23.257 --> 00:26.225
You're going to England
to free Lola.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.360
ELIZABETH:
You told Mary where to cross,

00:28.362 --> 00:30.129
but the ship sank
beyond the rocks,

00:30.131 --> 00:32.264
and many of the corpses
will never be found.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.233
Do you have proof
that she was aboard?

00:34.235 --> 00:35.367
Proof that she's dead?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.336
I believe she is.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.771
I saw a pin on Duncan's cloak

00:38.773 --> 00:41.040
<i> that bears the insignia</i>
<i> of the Clan Macfie.</i>

00:41.042 --> 00:42.274
These are the ones who tried
to assassinate me

00:42.276 --> 00:44.243
and killed Francis.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.279
The leader of the clan, a man
named Munro, ordered my murder.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.648
We will continue with our cover
story, they will escort us

00:49.650 --> 00:53.385
<i> to Munro, and I will rip out</i>
<i> his heart as he did mine.</i>

00:56.690 --> 00:58.757
(indistinct voices arguing)

01:01.595 --> 01:03.695
Pierre and Pauline don't
seem to be getting along.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.731
Are we really taking
them to Falkirk?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.633
Going out of our way just to
deliver this girl to her fiancé?

01:07.635 --> 01:09.101
DUNCAN:
Of course not.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.136
We may have an opportunity.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.638
Pierre's just told me
that his sister's

01:12.640 --> 01:14.173
to be married
to a wool merchant,

01:14.175 --> 01:16.141
and a rich one at that.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.476
He's risked life and limb
to deliver her

01:17.478 --> 01:19.478
to her future husband,
and now

01:19.480 --> 01:21.547
he wants compensation
for his troubles.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.781
He wants to ransom off
his own sister.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.417
With his sister
none the wiser,

01:25.419 --> 01:27.119
we'll hold on to them
for a few days until

01:27.121 --> 01:29.154
we can collect the
ransom from the fiancé.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.123
After we've split the money
with Pierre,

01:31.125 --> 01:32.391
we'll send them along
to Falkirk.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.460
One big happy family.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.462
Duncan, we can't carry out
a plan like this

01:36.464 --> 01:37.629
without Munro's approval.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.766
I think they're
talking it over.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.434
They'll go along
with the plan.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.770
This clan is notorious
for their greed.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.805
What makes you think they'll
take us to their leader, Munro?

01:46.807 --> 01:48.440
The men of Clan Macfie

01:48.442 --> 01:51.477
are loyal, but they're also
fearful of him.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.445
Bash?

01:53.447 --> 01:54.513
What is it?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.381
If this plans works

01:56.383 --> 01:57.449
and they take us to Munro,

01:57.451 --> 01:58.817
we'll be surrounded by a clan

01:58.819 --> 02:00.819
that wants
the queen of Scots dead.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.654
It's only a matter of time
before they find out

02:02.656 --> 02:04.490
we're not who
we say we are.
We only need

02:04.492 --> 02:06.225
enough time to get
close to Munro

02:06.227 --> 02:07.726
and kill him.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.229
This is the man who sent
assassins that killed Francis.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.530
I know that.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.764
But Francis would never
have wanted you

02:12.766 --> 02:15.300
to risk your life avenging his.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.504
Maybe not, but he would
have done the same for me.

02:18.506 --> 02:22.374
I cannot reclaim my throne
until I finish this.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.543
Duncan's coming.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.145
Duncan.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.547
How much longer until
we reach Falkirk?

02:28.549 --> 02:30.482
My fiancé will be waiting.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.583
Change of plan.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.452
We need to take a detour.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.554
We must refresh our horses
and gather the cargo

02:35.556 --> 02:36.822
taken from the shipwreck.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.594
Don't worry, Pauline,

02:42.596 --> 02:45.664
you'll see your fiancé
in good time.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.867
Mount your horses and follow us.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.640
They're taking us to Munro.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.411
HUGH:
What you did,

02:59.413 --> 03:00.479
betraying the king of France,

03:00.481 --> 03:02.681
your friend,

03:02.683 --> 03:04.550
couldn't have been easy.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.784
THIERRY:
As you said, Father,

03:05.786 --> 03:07.352
it's for the greater good.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.420
HUGH:
Soon, France will be a country

03:08.422 --> 03:09.555
we can be proud of.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.522
A country free of the tyranny

03:10.524 --> 03:11.657
of Catherine de Medici.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.225
And you, my son,

03:13.227 --> 03:15.427
will have played
an important part in that.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.963
ISAAC:
Keep quiet.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.232
Not a word.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.201
Destination and business.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.670
Le Mans. We're delivering
cabbage to a local merchant.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.904
Open the cart, please.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.576
Here's an inventory
of our cargo.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.377
In order to know

03:32.379 --> 03:34.746
how much tax to levy,
I must see what's inside.

03:34.748 --> 03:35.847
Now open it,

03:35.849 --> 03:36.982
or I seize everything.

03:40.221 --> 03:41.453
CHARLES:
Run!
What on earth?

03:41.822 --> 03:42.988
(gurgling)

03:43.724 --> 03:44.790
(groaning)

03:48.629 --> 03:49.695
ISAAC:
Relax, King Charles.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.597
It will all be over soon.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.633
¶ ¶

03:55.903 --> 03:57.502
The king has gone missing?

03:57.504 --> 03:58.837
Why did you not
come to us before

03:58.839 --> 04:00.405
about this threat
against the Crown?

04:00.407 --> 04:03.642
I believed these attacks
by the Red Knights

04:03.644 --> 04:06.345
were a personal vendetta
against me,

04:06.347 --> 04:08.647
and thus, I tried to
handle this threat alone,

04:08.649 --> 04:10.682
but I see now they seek

04:10.684 --> 04:13.552
to bring down the entire

04:13.554 --> 04:14.853
Valois family.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.656
They cannot succeed.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.659
And that is why I am calling
on you noblemen

04:20.661 --> 04:21.994
to help fight this threat.

04:21.996 --> 04:25.464
Find King Charles
and bring him home safely.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.999
We will do everything

04:27.001 --> 04:29.668
in our power to find your son
and crush these traitors.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.371
The king shall be in your debt.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.541
Thank you.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.543
I thank you.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.649
You were staring at me
during your speech.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.584
Must be like seeing a ghost.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.818
Martel de Guise.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.855
You have your father's eyes
and his candor.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.723
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.025
Yes, I was surprised

04:53.027 --> 04:54.993
to receive an invitation
to court now,

04:54.995 --> 04:57.496
so long after my
father's murder.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.331
Did you ever find

04:59.333 --> 05:00.866
the Protestant rebels
responsible?

05:00.868 --> 05:03.869
The assassins covered their
tracks too well, I'm afraid.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.471
I am confident, though,
they will be caught.

05:06.473 --> 05:10.075
Martel, I'm sorry you weren't
invited to court sooner.

05:10.077 --> 05:13.712
It's been difficult
since Francis died.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.348
I have been alone,
trying to keep the realm

05:16.350 --> 05:17.949
from falling apart.
You're still alone,
my queen.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.352
If you expect the nobles
to help save your son,

05:20.354 --> 05:21.920
don't hold your breath.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.655
They will do what
politicians do best:

05:23.657 --> 05:24.756
scamper back to
their châteaus

05:24.758 --> 05:26.625
and wait for things
to blow over.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.093
Their king is in danger.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.561
They will serve faithfully.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.962
With all due respect,
Queen Regent,

05:30.964 --> 05:32.931
they see Charles
as a figurehead.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.533
And you have other
sons to install

05:34.535 --> 05:36.435
should Charles...
France...

05:36.437 --> 05:37.736
cannot lose another king.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.739
Then you need powerful allies
at your side.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.774
My family's holdings and armies
can bolster your reign.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.377
I can protect you,
offer you counsel.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.646
I'm not sure I want to be
in debt to the Guises.

05:47.648 --> 05:51.350
You've always had a level
of distrust towards my family.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.919
You fear our influence
overtaking your own,

05:53.921 --> 05:56.988
but we share a
common goal, Catherine:

05:56.990 --> 05:59.358
the continuation
of the monarchy.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.894
Whatever benefits your family
can also benefit mine.

06:02.896 --> 06:06.031
Well, then I am grateful
to have your protection

06:06.033 --> 06:08.066
during these dangerous times.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.111
He was found on the road
from the beaches at Fife,

06:19.113 --> 06:20.946
badly wounded.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.949
He says he's a French mercenary
on his way to Scottish court.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.117
He says he has
vital information

06:25.119 --> 06:26.718
for Scotland's regent.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.127
You have
information for James,

06:35.129 --> 06:36.661
the brother of Queen Mary?

06:36.663 --> 06:39.698
You come from Scottish court?
Mm-hmm.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.134
Your regent will want
to hear this.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.035
But it's going to cost.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.705
I want passage
home to France,

06:46.707 --> 06:49.674
and gold. I want gold.
Of course.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.943
What is this
information?
I was on the ship

06:51.945 --> 06:54.479
that brought her
across from France.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.814
Queen Mary herself.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.682
A storm wrecked the ship.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.151
Only a few made it to shore.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.052
Mary barely escaped
the pillagers.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.522
One of them
did this to me.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.758
Mary? She's still alive?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.860
Not for long.

07:08.861 --> 07:10.961
Not if her brother
doesn't send help.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.931
You'll get word
to him right away?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.667
Of course.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.736
What is it
you hold so dear?

07:23.911 --> 07:27.078
The shipwreck was just off the
coast of Fife, my lord regent.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.148
En route
to Edinburgh?
It would seem so.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.683
There were French mercenaries
on board,

07:31.685 --> 07:33.785
and some very fine jewelry,

07:33.787 --> 07:35.220
scavenged by all manner
of pillagers.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.959
A noblewoman who hires
French mercenaries

07:40.961 --> 07:43.962
to escort her to Edinburgh.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.998
It could be Mary, but she never
sent word she was coming.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.233
(door opens)
PAGE:
Your lordships.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.502
John Knox.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.508
JAMES:
What is that?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.678
The Pope's gold.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.112
Used to pay those
French mercenaries

08:01.114 --> 08:02.514
you've been hearing about.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.583
Only one woman would
use the Pope's gold

08:04.585 --> 08:06.685
to buy an army to escort
her to Scotland.

08:06.687 --> 08:07.752
So it's true.
It was Mary.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.020
Where is she?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.622
I spoke to a surviving mercenary

08:10.624 --> 08:12.524
moments before he
succumbed to his wounds,

08:12.526 --> 08:13.959
who told me what he saw.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.897
My lord regent,
I am sorry to tell you,

08:18.899 --> 08:20.599
but your sister is dead.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.735
No.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.071
James, I understand
your grief.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.608
Don't pretend you care
that my sister is dead.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.976
Every man in Scotland knows

08:30.978 --> 08:32.611
you've prayed
for the end of her rule.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.912
You believe no woman
is worthy to wear a crown.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.214
Don't let grief
blind you, James.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.649
You were only the regent
in Mary's absence.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.717
Now that she's dead,

08:38.719 --> 08:39.918
the nobles will be forced

08:39.920 --> 08:41.086
to recognize the man
with the stronger

08:41.088 --> 08:43.722
claim to the throne,
Lord Darnley.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.056
I know you despise him.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.958
He is a Catholic, after all,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.093
but he's a noble with a

08:48.095 --> 08:49.828
legitimate blood claim.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.029
You were born a bastard.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.998
You can never be king.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.766
But we don't have
to hand over Scotland

08:54.768 --> 08:56.234
to a Papist like Darnley,

08:56.236 --> 09:00.772
nor anyone else with...
"royal blood."

09:00.774 --> 09:02.173
You want to dissolve
the monarchy.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.676
I want a nation
that no longer

09:04.678 --> 09:05.844
answers to royal families.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.078
You and I and
the other lords

09:07.080 --> 09:09.748
can rule Scotland together...

09:09.750 --> 09:11.816
...as a Protestant government.

09:14.821 --> 09:17.155
If we do this,
there's no turning back.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.558
Once the monarchy's dissolved,
there will never be

09:19.560 --> 09:23.929
another sovereign
king or queen of Scots.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.163
If Mary is somehow
still alive...

09:25.165 --> 09:29.034
Your sister is gone, James.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.603
Let her throne die with her.

09:31.605 --> 09:36.007
This isn't her country
any longer.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.075
It's ours.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.688
You're thinking of Mary.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.956
I can't believe she's gone.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.290
All I wanted to do was help her

09:52.292 --> 09:54.259
return home to Scotland.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.127
They still haven't
found her body,

09:56.129 --> 09:58.630
and if she died at sea,
they never will.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.932
It's all my fault.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.034
Do not punish yourself.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.003
She was your queen
and your friend,

10:05.005 --> 10:07.872
and you were loyal
to her until the very end.

10:07.874 --> 10:11.176
I pray that is true.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.311
My faith has been
a great comfort to me

10:13.313 --> 10:15.280
during this most
difficult time.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.182
That is why I must
decline your offer

10:17.184 --> 10:19.284
to convert
to Protestantism.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.119
I completely understand.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.322
I can arrange for you to take
a Mass in your chambers.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.725
Thank you, Elizabeth.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.361
Lola, I know
you're grieving,

10:29.363 --> 10:32.664
but I am in desperate
need of your counsel.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.200
With Mary dead, there's
a power vacuum in your country,

10:35.202 --> 10:37.168
and John Knox
would like nothing more

10:37.170 --> 10:39.037
than to dissolve
the Scottish throne,

10:39.039 --> 10:42.040
so he and men like him
can rule Scotland.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.208
If Knox takes power
in Scotland,

10:43.210 --> 10:44.709
he won't stop there.

10:44.711 --> 10:45.910
He'll continue his war

10:45.912 --> 10:47.379
against women here in England.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.180
He'll seek to dethrone you next.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.049
On the other hand, if he fails,

10:51.051 --> 10:52.350
the Scottish throne will go

10:52.352 --> 10:55.387
to the man who's next in line:
Lord Darnley.

10:55.389 --> 10:58.657
A Catholic man who also
has claim to my throne.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.664
Both Darnley and Knox

11:05.666 --> 11:09.000
are a danger to my reign.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.303
If either of them takes power,
I become vulnerable.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.305
But why come to me?

11:15.742 --> 11:17.242
There is another option.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.411
I could pursue
the Scottish throne.

11:19.413 --> 11:22.313
Unite both our countries
under my rule.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.315
Mary and I are cousins
after all.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.917
Limbs from the same tree.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.388
I realize it seems cold
to broach the subject

11:30.390 --> 11:32.757
so soon after Mary's death,

11:32.759 --> 11:36.261
but things are moving
very quickly in Scotland.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.129
Are you asking for my approval?

11:38.131 --> 11:39.998
I wish that was all I needed.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.199
The truth is,
you come from

11:41.201 --> 11:43.802
a very powerful family
in Scotland,

11:43.804 --> 11:45.837
and I will need the support
of the Catholic nobles

11:45.839 --> 11:47.338
your father holds sway with.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.108
But as a Protestant queen,
could you pledge to be tolerant

11:50.110 --> 11:52.277
of those who practice
the Catholic faith?

11:52.279 --> 11:54.713
My family, for instance.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.981
Yes, I'm not
a zealot like Knox,

11:56.983 --> 12:01.186
waging a religious war
on his own people.

12:01.188 --> 12:05.223
I will be tolerant and just.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.993
Lola, we could bring peace
to both our countries.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.363
Scotland was entrusted to Mary,

12:12.365 --> 12:14.365
to a true queen.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.936
But now, now that she's gone,

12:17.938 --> 12:20.105
without an heir...

12:21.308 --> 12:23.475
It should be entrusted
to another.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.012
Elizabeth, I will support you.

12:29.516 --> 12:34.119
This is your fault, Kitchen Boy.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.387
Following after Charles on some

12:36.389 --> 12:38.223
misguided plot to take down
the Red Knights.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.291
And then you go

12:40.293 --> 12:43.428
and lose the king of France
in the process.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.829
Your Highness, I am...

12:44.831 --> 12:45.930
Useless!

12:45.932 --> 12:47.432
That's what you are.
I swear,

12:47.434 --> 12:49.167
if any harm comes to my son,

12:49.169 --> 12:51.469
I will have...
It's not
Leith's fault.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.537
It's mine.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.539
I asked him to help Charles.

12:54.541 --> 12:58.309
Why on earth would you do
something so foolish?

12:58.311 --> 13:00.145
I wanted Leith to gain
the king's favor.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.946
In return for his help,

13:01.948 --> 13:03.982
Charles promised
to make Leith a Duke,

13:03.984 --> 13:06.117
so that...

13:07.387 --> 13:09.387
...so that we could marry.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.323
I should have your head

13:12.325 --> 13:16.161
for encouraging
such a dangerous fantasy.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.432
However, stupid as you may be,

13:21.434 --> 13:23.101
at least you're loyal.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.036
With the Red Knights
hiding in our midst,

13:25.038 --> 13:28.106
loyalty is in short supply.

13:29.543 --> 13:30.942
You may go.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.112
Thank you, Your Grace.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.283
Claude, I have asked the nobles

13:38.285 --> 13:39.517
to help in finding Charles.

13:39.519 --> 13:45.957
But for your own personal
safety, trust no one.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.559
Not the kingsguard

13:47.561 --> 13:50.461
and especially not the likes
of Martel de Guise.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.298
Martel de Guise is here?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.933
And I would not be surprised

13:54.935 --> 13:58.536
if Martel was a part
of the Red Knights conspiracy.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.272
But the Guises control
the richest regions in France.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.141
We've always left them alone.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.476
What motive would Martel have
against our family?

14:05.478 --> 14:09.881
I have no idea
what grievance he carries.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.883
So I'm ordering you,

14:11.885 --> 14:13.418
keep your distance.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.161
What are you doing here?

14:23.163 --> 14:26.164
It's nice to
see you again, Claude.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.566
You look exquisite,
as always.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.568
Save your flattery,
and tell me why you're here.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.636
Well, I came back for you,
darling.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.072
You're lying.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.874
Just like you lied
when we were together.
That...

14:35.876 --> 14:37.208
was years ago.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.443
And all I did was lie
about my family name.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.311
If I'd have known
you were a Guise,

14:40.313 --> 14:42.447
I would have never let you
take me to bed that night.

14:42.449 --> 14:45.216
As I recall, we spent three
nights together in Florence.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.517
Living in absolute sin.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.186
We were
magnificent together.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.420
If I had told you
who I was,

14:49.422 --> 14:50.288
would things have
turned out the same?

14:50.290 --> 14:51.556
You tricked me.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.924
I only realized who you were

14:52.926 --> 14:54.225
after you left that château.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.461
And now you come here
to sabotage my family.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.962
What are you talking about?

14:57.964 --> 14:59.297
You're one of them.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.965
Maybe you're their leader,
I don't know.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.634
One of who?
The Red Knights.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.168
The Guise family has always

15:04.170 --> 15:05.069
wanted more power at court.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.170
Maybe this is your way of...

15:06.172 --> 15:07.906
I am not a Red Knight.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.407
Then tell me why you're here.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.176
And don't say it's
to help my family.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.245
I came back to find
my father's murderer.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.180
They say it was
Protestant rebels,

15:16.182 --> 15:18.082
but I suspect
something else is at work.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.550
I came back for answers,
Claude.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.219
And, yes, while I'm here,

15:21.221 --> 15:22.654
I will help find your brother,

15:22.656 --> 15:25.690
and I will certainly
protect you.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.259
And that's the truth.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.664
Fine.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.966
I believe you.
Claude, wait.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.369
Now that we've cleared the air,

15:38.371 --> 15:40.104
why don't you stay for a while?

15:40.106 --> 15:43.141
We could drink some wine
and reacquaint ourselves.

15:44.611 --> 15:51.282
I can think of nothing in the
world that I would like...

15:52.052 --> 15:54.052
...less.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.292
(honking)

16:09.202 --> 16:10.702
A grim crowd.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.603
You're lucky they don't
know who you really are,

16:12.605 --> 16:16.074
they might not look
at you so warmly.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.175
DUNCAN:
Come with me.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.443
Munro's waiting.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.317
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

16:35.161 --> 16:37.228
This is Pauline and Pierre.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.031
What a terrible welcome Scotland
has shown you both.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.566
Shipwrecked.
Taken by the Druids.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.501
And then a long, cruel ride

16:43.503 --> 16:45.169
with these barbarians.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.671
(crowd cheering)

16:46.673 --> 16:49.407
You must crave a warm bath
and fresh clothes.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.210
You must be the leader,
Munro, that Duncan spoke of.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.712
Will you offer my brother
and me your protection?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.180
We're traveling
to meet my fiancé.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.050
Yes, I will.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.119
But on one condition.

17:02.088 --> 17:03.588
You must join us for the feast

17:03.590 --> 17:05.289
celebrating the return
of our scouts.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.325
Take our beautiful guest.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.327
Help her bathe
and change.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.795
WOMAN:
Come with us, dear.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.399
Take his sword.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.568
I thought we were guests.
You are.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.604
But Duncan told me
about this ransom plot,

17:19.606 --> 17:21.339
and I'm not quite sure
I trust a man

17:21.341 --> 17:23.207
who would scheme
against his own sister.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.276
Assuming you're telling
the truth at all.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.178
I've sent a rider to Falkirk

17:27.180 --> 17:30.381
to find Pauline's fiancé
and report back at dawn.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.052
If you're lying to me,

17:34.054 --> 17:36.654
you and your sister
won't leave this camp alive.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.797
(quietly):
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord be with thee.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.298
Blessed are the men and women

17:47.300 --> 17:50.134
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb Jesus.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.070
Thank you for coming, Father.

17:52.072 --> 17:55.073
You're quite welcome, Lola.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.774
Stephan?

17:58.511 --> 18:00.545
What the hell
are you doing here?
I'm here to rescue you.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.380
We need to leave at once.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.082
No, you cannot be here.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.783
I know I've made mistakes.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.251
I lied to you.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.487
I-I chose power
time and again.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.122
And I gained
everything I wanted.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.458
I'm lord chancellor of France.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.829
But it's all meaningless
without you.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.865
Come home to me, Lola.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.803
Where would that be, exactly?

18:25.805 --> 18:28.439
Back to France?
To Catherine?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.408
I will follow you anywhere.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.410
We could go to Scotland
to be with Mary.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.779
Stephan, Mary's dead.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.280
She died in a shipwreck.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.748
I was on that boat with her.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.617
Mary survived.
She's in Scotland.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.452
She's alive?
Yeah.

18:41.454 --> 18:45.189
My friend is alive?

18:45.191 --> 18:46.357
Oh, dear God,
this is terrible.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.625
What?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.727
Elizabeth is moving in
on what she thinks

18:49.729 --> 18:52.163
is a vacant Scottish throne.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.298
I offered her my support,
my family's support.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.701
She's amassing English troops
on the border as we speak.

18:56.703 --> 18:57.835
What are you talking about?

18:57.837 --> 18:59.170
W-With Mary gone,
unification

18:59.172 --> 19:01.239
seemed the most
peaceful solution.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.874
And Elizabeth promised peace.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.208
You do not belong here,

19:04.210 --> 19:05.710
trying to effect
the fate of nations.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.278
But I can.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.279
Don't you see?

19:08.281 --> 19:09.547
E-Elizabeth trusts me.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.382
Well, she listens to me, anyway.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.550
I must tell her
to abandon her plans.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.684
That Mary is alive.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.219
And how will you do that?

19:15.221 --> 19:16.888
Will you tell her that
your husband, the lord

19:16.890 --> 19:19.490
chancellor of France,
snuck into her country,

19:19.492 --> 19:21.425
her castle, to rescue you?

19:21.427 --> 19:24.262
She will smell espionage,
deceit.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.297
And what makes you
think her plans

19:26.299 --> 19:27.798
to take Scotland,
once in motion,

19:27.800 --> 19:29.433
will be so easily given up?

19:29.435 --> 19:30.935
From what I understand,
Elizabeth

19:30.937 --> 19:33.471
is consumed with trying
to retain her power.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.439
Mary is the rightful
queen of Scotland.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.408
If she's back,
i-if Scotland is stabilized,

19:37.410 --> 19:39.644
I think Elizabeth
will change her mind.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.880
But if I'm wrong,

19:42.882 --> 19:45.950
if Elizabeth's desire for
Scotland has grown too strong,

19:45.952 --> 19:47.618
she could invade regardless.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.688
The news of Mary's survival
cannot come from you.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.591
It has to be leaked to Elizabeth
from some other source.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.593
The letters

19:55.595 --> 19:56.561
you exchanged with Mary.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.728
How did you get them in and out?

19:57.730 --> 19:58.763
John's governess, Renee.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.531
She's on our side.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.333
Part of a network of
Catholic spies here in England.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.268
Have Renee leak the news

20:04.270 --> 20:06.537
of Mary's survival
to Elizabeth somehow.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.606
An anonymous message

20:08.608 --> 20:10.608
from a Protestant friend
in Scottish court.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.310
Someone afraid
to reveal themselves

20:12.312 --> 20:16.414
lest they suffer the wrath
of the queen of Scots.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.919
I will try to help Mary,

20:21.921 --> 20:24.956
but all I care about
is your safety.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.691
Stephan, you need to leave.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.392
If the English find
out who you are

20:28.394 --> 20:29.460
and what you're
doing here...
All right.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.229
I will keep my distance.

20:31.231 --> 20:34.298
But I'm not leaving England
without you.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.840
(bagpipes playing)

20:49.949 --> 20:51.549
We have a problem.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.317
Munro sent a rider to
Falkirk to confirm our story

20:53.319 --> 20:55.553
about your fiancé.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.255
If he comes back
tomorrow with news

20:57.257 --> 20:59.690
we've been lying,
we'll both be dead.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.492
Mary, we need to
get out of here.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.629
If we slip away now
and ride to Edinburgh,

21:04.631 --> 21:06.030
you can come back later
with an army.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.898
MARY:
Munro is too well protected.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.268
Even if the Scottish army could
break through his defenses,

21:10.270 --> 21:12.303
he'd just melt into
the forest. Disappear.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.505
We may never get another
chance like this again.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.940
Munro already took my sword,
and even if I had it,

21:15.942 --> 21:17.642
I can't get close enough
to Munro to kill him.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.043
He's surrounded by guards
at all times.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.347
I can get close to him.

21:23.349 --> 21:24.782
It's too dangerous, Mary.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.750
Your throne is still
vulnerable to John Knox.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.585
Every moment we spend here,

21:27.587 --> 21:29.787
you risk the monarchy dissolving
before your return.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.689
Then we have to do this tonight.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.427
Don't worry, Pierre,
it's just one dance.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.776
How can you betray me like this?

21:51.778 --> 21:54.679
This is the start
of a revolution.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.847
And thanks to the Red Knights,
I'm a part of it.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.016
They only recruited you
as a way to get close to me.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.752
Once I'm dead, your value
will quickly fade.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.587
You'll spend the rest
of your life knowing

22:03.589 --> 22:05.589
you were responsible
for the death of your king.

22:05.591 --> 22:06.724
And your friend.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.693
They're not going
to kill you.

22:08.695 --> 22:11.362
They want Catherine for all
she's done to this country.

22:11.364 --> 22:13.664
After they kill the regent,
the monarchy will fall.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.366
You'll live out your life
in exile.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.635
Exile?

22:17.637 --> 22:20.037
Thierry, I'm king.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.605
The only way to
end the monarchy

22:21.607 --> 22:23.708
is to kill my entire family.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.743
Eat your food.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.013
(door closes)

22:29.015 --> 22:31.415
(door locks)

22:31.417 --> 22:34.785
You went and saw him after I
specifically told you not to.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.754
Relax. Martel would
never hurt me.

22:36.756 --> 22:39.390
What makes you so sure?

22:39.392 --> 22:41.392
Oh, good Lord.

22:41.394 --> 22:42.626
You have a history.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.462
History is a strong word.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.698
It was more
of a... dalliance.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.635
The point is, Martel is not
one of the Red Knights.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.637
That group is hell-bent
on destroying the monarchy,

22:53.639 --> 22:55.106
but the Guises have done
quite well for themselves

22:55.108 --> 22:56.674
with the Valois
on the throne.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.676
They benefit from your rule,

22:58.678 --> 23:00.845
so why would they want
to see you fall?

23:02.648 --> 23:05.149
I'm telling you, Mother,
Martel is no threat.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.718
He's simply here to figure
out who killed his father.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.853
What?

23:08.855 --> 23:11.389
Isn't that good news?
No.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.124
That is the opposite
of good news.

23:13.126 --> 23:16.427
Especially for
whoever murdered his father.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.763
Please tell me
that wasn't you.

23:18.765 --> 23:21.031
It's complicated.
Honestly, Mother.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.000
How many people
have you killed?
Shh.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.502
We received this message

23:24.504 --> 23:25.569
just moments ago.

23:25.571 --> 23:28.406
It's addressed to you.

23:28.408 --> 23:32.176
The Red Knights?

23:32.178 --> 23:35.913
It's a ransom note,
confirming they have Charles.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.181
Wh-What do they want?

23:37.183 --> 23:38.816
A life for a life.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.751
I'm to travel alone
to a clearing north

23:40.753 --> 23:42.686
of the castle at dawn,
and it is here

23:42.688 --> 23:47.158
that I am to die
for my countless sins.

23:47.160 --> 23:50.895
They will free Charles
in return.

23:50.897 --> 23:54.565
They have no intention
of freeing your brother.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.901
They're just using him
to lure me out in the open.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.203
Where they will try
to kill us both.

23:59.205 --> 24:01.005
What are you going to do?

24:01.007 --> 24:03.808
I'm going to go
to that clearing.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.676
It's the only way
to save Charles.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.711
If Charles doesn't come back,

24:07.713 --> 24:09.547
I want you to see to it

24:09.549 --> 24:10.981
that your brothers and sisters

24:10.983 --> 24:12.850
are safely transported to Spain.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.685
Seek refuge
with your older sister.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.554
Mother, no.
I want you to promise me

24:16.556 --> 24:19.123
that you will take care
of your siblings.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.558
Look on the bright side:

24:20.560 --> 24:21.792
you'll finally be rid of me.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.795
There has to be another way.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.132
I promise you, Claude,

24:28.134 --> 24:30.534
your mother's not going
down without a fight.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.607
And these men
that you've selected,

24:36.609 --> 24:37.908
you're sure they
can be trusted?

24:37.910 --> 24:38.943
These three guards
are our finest.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.177
Men loyal to the throne.

24:40.179 --> 24:43.914
Three. I specifically
requested four.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.749
I am the fourth.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.885
I'm not letting you
go out there alone.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.253
I was responsible
for Charles' safety

24:49.255 --> 24:50.588
when he was taken.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.189
I can't just sit by
and do nothing.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.190
I have a duty to my king.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.658
Well, what about my daughter?

24:54.660 --> 24:56.827
Who will protect her
while you're away?

24:56.829 --> 24:58.829
The kingsguard?
They have been compromised.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.231
We don't know who we can trust.

25:00.233 --> 25:01.999
Claude says Martel de Guise

25:02.001 --> 25:03.968
is keeping a close eye
on her until we return.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.536
His private guards
are at the ready,

25:05.538 --> 25:07.505
and she assured me
that he can be trusted.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.073
Did she now?

25:09.075 --> 25:11.275
I'm sure he'll do a fine job
guarding her person.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.027
Leith,

25:13.028 --> 25:14.778
I know you want
to redeem yourself.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.214
And I need men that I can trust,
but are you sure

25:17.216 --> 25:19.984
that you're ready
so soon after your injury?

25:19.986 --> 25:21.085
I am ready.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.786
Did you do as I asked?

25:22.788 --> 25:24.221
Are the seamstresses at work?

25:24.223 --> 25:26.657
They are following
every detail you described,

25:26.659 --> 25:28.225
but, Your Majesty, it would
help if you'd actually

25:28.227 --> 25:29.927
share your plan with us.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.262
The Knights' message said
to come alone.

25:31.264 --> 25:33.130
If they see us coming...
They won't
see you coming.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.866
Because you're going
to get there first.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.605
James.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.278
(knocking at door)

25:47.280 --> 25:49.780
We need to talk.

25:50.783 --> 25:51.949
Lady Kirkland?

25:54.020 --> 25:56.554
Fornication is a sin,

25:56.556 --> 25:58.022
even if it is a perk
of the regency.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.958
Enjoy it while you can, James.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.593
Soon Darnley will
be installed as king,

26:02.595 --> 26:05.029
and you'll be asked to leave.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.697
No one will be

26:06.699 --> 26:10.301
installed until I've found proof
that Mary is dead.

26:10.303 --> 26:11.569
My men are
still searching for her.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.237
She's gone, James.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.573
You served her admirably,
but Scotland needs you now.

26:15.575 --> 26:16.807
You cannot...
Do not

26:16.809 --> 26:19.910
tell me what I can or cannot do.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.812
I still rule Scotland, not you.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.047
All right, then.

26:23.049 --> 26:26.150
Do nothing, but I promise you,

26:26.152 --> 26:27.918
others aren't
making that mistake.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.053
What does that mean?

26:29.055 --> 26:30.754
My spies in England believe

26:30.756 --> 26:33.090
that Elizabeth is plotting
to take the Scottish Crown.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.258
Has Elizabeth heard about Mary?

26:34.260 --> 26:36.293
If she hasn't already,
she will soon enough.

26:36.295 --> 26:40.898
And if Elizabeth invades,
all bets are off.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.266
She'll get rid of us both.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.368
I've preached against
the reign of queens,

26:44.370 --> 26:46.070
and you've spent far too long

26:46.072 --> 26:47.304
defending Mary's throne.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.273
The only way out of this

26:49.275 --> 26:50.741
is to work together.

26:50.743 --> 26:51.909
To rally the lords

26:51.911 --> 26:53.844
and take power
as a unified government

26:53.846 --> 26:55.279
that Elizabeth dare not defy.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.314
I've informed the lords
of Mary's death.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.617
They support this, James.

26:59.619 --> 27:00.784
Call a meeting,

27:00.786 --> 27:04.388
and dissolve the throne.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.156
It's Scotland's only hope.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.061
(bagpipe music playing)

27:11.063 --> 27:13.297
(laughing)

27:13.299 --> 27:15.366
You're quite the
dancer, Pauline.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.267
You must be looking
forward to your wedding.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.669
Plenty of dancing

27:18.671 --> 27:21.071
and a new man to
spend your life with.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.108
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.676
Do I sense some
reservations?

27:25.678 --> 27:27.044
I don't know the man at all,

27:27.046 --> 27:29.380
but I do know
that he's twice my age.

27:29.382 --> 27:30.681
An older man can

27:30.683 --> 27:32.383
still excite a woman.

27:32.385 --> 27:33.384
An older warrior, maybe,

27:33.386 --> 27:36.120
but an older wool merchant?

27:36.122 --> 27:37.688
Somehow I doubt it.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.189
Perhaps this

27:39.191 --> 27:41.725
warrior could honor you
with a wedding gift.

27:41.727 --> 27:44.194
My raiders came home
with some fine jewelry.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.130
Come to my chambers.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.198
I would be happy to show you.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.401
I would like that very much,
but, um...

27:50.403 --> 27:53.370
May I dance
with my brother first?

27:53.372 --> 27:55.739
Certainly.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.712
Munro's invited me back to his
cabin without his guards.

28:01.714 --> 28:03.714
Mary, I can't help you there.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.416
I know.
This is insane.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.317
I've seen the look
in Munro's eye.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.886
What he wants.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.721
It's not worth it.

28:13.893 --> 28:14.809
Pauline. Come on.

28:14.810 --> 28:15.726
If you want to help me,
you can find some horses

28:15.728 --> 28:17.461
and stage a diversion.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.797
BASH:
If you do this, you might
not come back the same.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.071
I know what you're up to, Lola.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.306
I beg your pardon?

28:29.308 --> 28:31.809
You're deflecting.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.410
Forcing my rook
out of position.

28:33.412 --> 28:36.013
You know me too well, Elizabeth.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.749
So, have you spoken
to Dudley lately?

28:38.751 --> 28:39.817
Not in weeks.

28:39.819 --> 28:42.352
He writes,
asking for an audience,

28:42.354 --> 28:44.855
but I don't want to encourage
him, as we have no future.

28:44.857 --> 28:47.224
(door opens)
ADVISOR: Queen Elizabeth,
I have news from Scotland.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.928
Well, whatever the news,
it can be said in front of Lola.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.496
We're unifying our countries,

28:52.498 --> 28:55.232
and Lola will serve as one
of my Scottish advisors.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.834
We have received word
from anonymous sources

28:56.836 --> 28:58.936
that Mary, Queen of Scots,
is alive

28:58.938 --> 29:01.004
and back on Scottish soil.

29:01.006 --> 29:02.339
Mary's alive?

29:02.341 --> 29:03.407
Are you certain?

29:03.409 --> 29:04.475
We're reaching out to our spies

29:04.477 --> 29:06.276
in Scotland for confirmation,

29:06.278 --> 29:08.312
but the message states
Queen Mary survived

29:08.314 --> 29:09.780
the shipwreck and is heading

29:09.782 --> 29:11.115
to Edinburgh
to reclaim her throne.

29:11.117 --> 29:13.450
Your Highness,
in light of this information,

29:13.452 --> 29:15.352
should we halt our military
advances in Scotland?

29:16.455 --> 29:18.188
I don't think that's wise.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.490
But Mary's alive.

29:21.327 --> 29:22.793
We don't know that for sure.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.027
Anyone could have
sent this message.

29:24.029 --> 29:25.462
Perhaps it's Knox
concocting a lie

29:25.464 --> 29:28.165
to sabotage my quest
for the throne.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.533
But if the queen of Scots lives,

29:29.535 --> 29:31.135
then her throne is
no longer available.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.770
Several Scottish lords
have already agreed

29:32.772 --> 29:34.471
to back me as their ruler.

29:34.473 --> 29:35.873
If I abandon them now,

29:35.875 --> 29:37.975
pull my forces for some rumor,

29:37.977 --> 29:41.779
Scotland could fall to Knox
and his fanatics.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.349
You do understand, don't you?

29:47.887 --> 29:49.820
Yes, I understand.

29:52.458 --> 29:56.326
I will do what is best
for Scotland.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.228
I promise you.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.134
She's stalling.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.803
I'm the one who taught her
that it's better to stall

30:05.805 --> 30:07.004
than to give
an unpopular answer,

30:07.006 --> 30:08.872
and that's what she's doing.

30:08.874 --> 30:11.074
Stephan, you were right.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.142
She's not turning back.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.544
You need to come
with me now.

30:13.546 --> 30:15.045
It's not that simple.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.480
No, I'm your husband.
John is your son.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.849
And I have to keep you safe.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.551
Lola, I know I destroyed

30:20.553 --> 30:21.985
your trust in me.

30:21.987 --> 30:25.556
I did terrible things
to keep you with me,

30:25.558 --> 30:27.324
but the day I married you,
I made a promise

30:27.326 --> 30:29.827
to love and protect you
for the rest of my life.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.162
You have to trust me
when I say that

30:32.164 --> 30:33.964
if anything were
to happen to you...

30:36.569 --> 30:38.101
Just come with me.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.038
I don't care how long it takes,

30:41.040 --> 30:42.906
but whatever I have...

30:48.881 --> 30:50.280
Listen to me.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.915
Elizabeth will be
traveling north

30:51.917 --> 30:54.384
to meet with some dignitaries
in just a few days.

30:54.386 --> 30:55.919
While she's away from court,

30:55.921 --> 30:58.388
I'll have an opportunity
to escape unnoticed.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.990
Giving us a head start.

30:59.991 --> 31:01.591
Gideon will arrange a boat
to get us out of England

31:01.594 --> 31:03.493
as soon as she's left court.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.162
You'll have to wait
for me until then.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.864
I'll have Renee contact you
when it's time.

31:06.866 --> 31:09.633
John and I will meet you
outside the castle walls.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.568
You take us to that boat,

31:11.570 --> 31:14.972
then we'll leave
and never look back.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.583
Pick whatever
catches your eye.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.558
This necklace
is rather grand.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.427
Let's see how
it looks on you.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.907
Sorry, I'm just
a little nervous.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.241
Don't be afraid.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.911
Even a warrior's
touch can be gentle.

31:57.483 --> 32:01.551
That wool merchant
does not deserve you.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.325
I doubt he's ever held
a sword in his hand.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.261
Neither have I,
for that matter.

32:11.263 --> 32:14.097
The short sword?
Do you like it?

32:14.099 --> 32:15.599
Will you teach me how to use it?

32:15.601 --> 32:16.700
(laughs)

32:21.573 --> 32:22.639
Look at that.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.943
It's got an
inscription in Latin.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.577
Bastard tongue
of our oppressors:

32:27.579 --> 32:28.979
the Catholic Church.

32:28.981 --> 32:31.982
Did they teach you
Latin back in France?

32:31.984 --> 32:33.684
I never bothered to learn.

32:33.686 --> 32:35.953
My brother and I
are Protestant, like you.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.688
Latin is becoming popular
here in Scotland.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.523
Especially amongst the clans.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.358
I doubt anyone here could

32:41.360 --> 32:42.960
translate this for us.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.528
Except me.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.097
You see, before I lost my lands

32:47.099 --> 32:48.966
to Catholic tyranny,

32:48.968 --> 32:51.435
I was born and raised
a Scottish noble.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.203
Received the finest education

32:53.205 --> 32:55.272
and learned the language
of my enemies.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.140
"My queen. My light.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.342
My love."

33:01.647 --> 33:03.180
This sword belonged to a queen.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.716
It must be quite valuable then.

33:05.718 --> 33:08.185
It was found in the wreckage
of your ship, Pauline.

33:08.187 --> 33:09.720
The same ship that carried

33:09.722 --> 33:11.355
hundreds of mercenaries
from France.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.589
And it's not
unusual for France

33:12.591 --> 33:14.992
to send soldiers
to fight on our shores.

33:14.994 --> 33:18.362
To send gold and jewels
to support the Catholic cause.

33:18.364 --> 33:21.698
But if this sword
belonged to a queen,

33:21.700 --> 33:24.101
then perhaps they
were carrying a cargo

33:24.103 --> 33:26.737
far more precious than gold.

33:26.739 --> 33:30.474
A Scottish queen,
raised in France...

33:31.610 --> 33:34.144
...making her journey home.

33:34.146 --> 33:36.313
I-I didn't see any queen
on the ship.

33:36.315 --> 33:40.017
My brother told me to stay
in our cabin for my safety.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.386
I've never seen
a portrait of the queen.

33:42.388 --> 33:45.789
I've only heard tales
of her raven-haired beauty.

33:45.791 --> 33:48.692
And how she bewitches
the hearts of men.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.630
I can see you clearly now,

33:53.632 --> 33:57.801
Mary, Queen of Scots,

33:57.803 --> 34:00.303
and I am not bewitched.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.583
Are you lost, Pierre?

34:13.585 --> 34:16.787
Trying to find some decent wine.

34:16.789 --> 34:18.422
What are you doing out here?

34:18.424 --> 34:20.157
No offense,
but your Scottish ales...

34:20.826 --> 34:22.793
I take it back.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.361
The ale works.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.096
Help me up, friend.

34:26.098 --> 34:27.597
French.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.466
You drink like women.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.169
(grunts)

35:04.303 --> 35:06.636
MUNRO:
<i> You're a tyrant.</i>

35:06.638 --> 35:08.538
Whoring this country to Rome.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.773
To the French.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.141
To whomever

35:11.143 --> 35:13.810
will keep you in power.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.179
I sent my men
to France to kill you.

35:16.181 --> 35:18.381
And they failed.

35:18.383 --> 35:20.217
My husband protected me.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.352
Francis is dead because of you.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.321
Oh, do you grieve, Mary Stuart?

35:24.323 --> 35:25.856
Do you grieve for all
that you have done

35:25.858 --> 35:27.657
to my family?

35:27.659 --> 35:29.159
What are you talking about?

35:29.161 --> 35:30.827
You named my
father a traitor.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.329
Took his lands.

35:32.331 --> 35:35.232
Cast us out to steal,
starve or die.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.634
You have no idea
what I have lost.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.337
How many of my brothers
I have buried.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.805
This is why you wish to kill me?

35:41.807 --> 35:44.241
This is why my husband is dead?

35:44.243 --> 35:46.143
I gave no such order.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.844
My mother sat
the Scottish throne

35:47.846 --> 35:49.880
while I was an ocean away.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.214
She made her own decisions.

35:51.216 --> 35:53.483
In your name.
They are your sins.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.318
Look into my eyes.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.754
I never gave any order
against your family.

35:57.756 --> 36:02.359
And now my husband
is dead for nothing.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.894
It doesn't matter anymore.

36:03.896 --> 36:07.764
It doesn't matter
where it began.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.599
Someone has to finish it.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.501
I know.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.338
(groans)

36:23.949 --> 36:27.484
I would have stayed in France
for the rest of my life,

36:27.486 --> 36:29.653
but you brought me here.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.254
You took my heart.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.924
And now I've come
to repay you.

36:34.793 --> 36:35.825
(groans)

36:40.299 --> 36:42.365
(villagers clamoring)

36:52.978 --> 36:54.511
We have to leave. Now.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.828
HUGH: I won't do it.
ISAAC: You said you were
committed to our cause.

37:11.830 --> 37:15.432
HUGH:
I am, but this was
never part of the plan.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.634
We agreed to kill
Catherine at dawn.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.369
Not her son.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.238
The king is barely a man.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.939
You don't even know what
kind of king he'll be.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.975
I won't murder him
for the sins of his mother.

37:24.977 --> 37:26.509
There I draw the line.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.511
I understand.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.684
(groans)

37:36.355 --> 37:38.255
They killed my father.
You were right.

37:38.257 --> 37:39.356
About everything.
I'm so sorry.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.523
We have to escape.

37:40.525 --> 37:42.392
Let's go.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.001
MAN:
You are to dismount your horse

37:51.003 --> 37:55.372
and cross the field
as instructed.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.706
Where is the king?

37:56.708 --> 37:57.974
Come to us now

37:57.976 --> 37:59.843
and we'll take
you to your son.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.911
So you are the traitorous
Red Knights.

38:01.913 --> 38:04.014
Do you still hide
in the shadows?

38:05.817 --> 38:07.317
Cross the field,
Queen Regent.

38:07.319 --> 38:09.586
I will take no step further

38:09.588 --> 38:11.021
until you produce Charles.

38:11.023 --> 38:13.323
You were given instructions.

38:13.325 --> 38:15.025
If you hope to see
your son alive,

38:15.027 --> 38:16.626
you will follow them.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.629
(horn blows)

38:21.366 --> 38:22.799
Take her now!

38:22.801 --> 38:24.634
And kill her!

38:24.636 --> 38:26.436
(groans)

38:26.438 --> 38:27.504
CATHERINE:
Leith!

38:27.506 --> 38:29.639
(yells)

38:29.641 --> 38:33.376
(grunting)

38:42.454 --> 38:45.355
Charles! Charles!

38:46.792 --> 38:49.793
He isn't here.
Charles isn't here.
We'll find him.

38:49.795 --> 38:51.528
One of the Red Knights fled
when he heard the horn.

38:51.530 --> 38:52.929
Why did he change his course?

38:52.931 --> 38:54.364
I don't know.

38:54.366 --> 38:55.598
But he might.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.667
I made sure to keep one alive.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.371
Where is the king?
(bones snapping)

39:01.373 --> 39:02.405
(groans)
Tyrant!

39:02.407 --> 39:04.074
You have yet to feel my tyranny.

39:04.076 --> 39:05.442
Tell me!

39:05.444 --> 39:07.844
Or I will peel the flesh
off of your bones.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.045
(screaming)

39:09.047 --> 39:10.413
Tell me!

39:10.415 --> 39:11.448
(screaming)

39:11.450 --> 39:13.083
Speak!

39:27.532 --> 39:28.565
Where's John?

39:28.567 --> 39:29.833
I-I can't leave
without my child.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.067
My lady, I'm so sorry,

39:31.069 --> 39:33.703
but we received word
from Edinburgh.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.472
It's from Mary.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.875
(gasps)

39:39.911 --> 39:41.578
What's this gold for?

39:41.580 --> 39:43.546
To bribe my way
to safety once...

39:43.548 --> 39:45.148
This can't be.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.549
It's written in Mary's code,

39:46.551 --> 39:48.551
but what she's
asking me to do...

39:48.553 --> 39:50.053
What does Mary ask of you?

39:50.055 --> 39:53.123
To kill Queen Elizabeth.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.704
Every lord that's gathered here

40:07.706 --> 40:09.873
knows how difficult
this is for me.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.609
The blood of Scottish royals
flows through my veins.

40:12.611 --> 40:14.844
We understand your
resistance, James.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.580
But with Mary gone,

40:17.582 --> 40:19.582
you must respect the will
of this council.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.728
KNOX:
<i> Today Scotland</i>

40:31.730 --> 40:34.063
must cast off the chains
of the monarchy.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.598
If we want freedom,

40:35.600 --> 40:36.866
we must act now.
JAMES: Enough.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.701
