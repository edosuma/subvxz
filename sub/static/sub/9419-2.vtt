12:13.734 --> 12:16.301
Brief recap: Carmen reached out

12:16.303 --> 12:19.871
To us because her cousin antwane

12:19.873 --> 12:21.239
Has been in a relationship

12:21.241 --> 12:22.741
For three years with a guy

12:22.743 --> 12:23.508
He's just been talking to

12:23.510 --> 12:24.309
On the phone.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.076
>> he doesn't have his phone

12:25.078 --> 12:25.777
Number.

12:25.779 --> 12:26.978
He doesn't know his last name.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.246
He doesn't know where he lives.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.214
He knows basically nothing about

12:29.216 --> 12:30.248
Him except that his name is

12:30.250 --> 12:31.382
Tony, or at least that's what he

12:31.384 --> 12:32.450
Says his name is.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.452
>> at the very beginning, he had

12:34.454 --> 12:35.954
A phone number for tony.

12:35.956 --> 12:36.988
But ever since then, they

12:36.990 --> 12:38.389
Haven't been using that phone

12:38.391 --> 12:39.791
Number, and tony has called him

12:39.793 --> 12:41.159
From a private number.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.694
So if antwane wants to talk to

12:42.696 --> 12:44.329
Tony, he has to wait for tony to

12:44.331 --> 12:46.531
Call him from a private number.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.799
So here we go.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.601
We have one thing to look up.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.102
The one phone number he has for

12:51.104 --> 12:52.604
Tony, who's ostensibly from

12:52.606 --> 12:55.940
Atlanta, is a 513 area code

12:55.942 --> 12:57.008
Phone number which is a

12:57.010 --> 12:58.810
Cincinnati area code.

12:58.812 --> 12:59.911
>> I'm gonna go spokeo,

12:59.913 --> 13:02.013
Putting in the number that

13:02.015 --> 13:03.148
Antwane gave us.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.883
All right, this is all we got,

13:04.885 --> 13:07.418
So putting a lot on this thing.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.286
>> press the button.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.020
>> I'm gonna click with my

13:09.022 --> 13:09.687
Fingers crossed.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.756
>> click it.

13:11.758 --> 13:14.125
>> nothing.

13:14.127 --> 13:14.793
>> oh.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.661
>> oh, devastating.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.395
>> hold on.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.263
>> the investigation's over.

13:18.265 --> 13:18.930
>> hold on.

13:18.932 --> 13:19.731
>> I haven't even finished my

13:19.733 --> 13:20.398
Cappuccino.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.500
>> we can google the number.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.135
What is this?

13:24.137 --> 13:27.906
So this number is registered to

13:27.908 --> 13:30.875
A diana thomas in cincinnati.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.010
>> so we have an address

13:32.012 --> 13:32.811
And a name.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.445
Okay, we might have a hit here.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.513
>> this could be something.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.214
>> search for her.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.482
Diana thomas, cincinnati.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.551
>> let's go spokeo again.

13:39.553 --> 13:41.920
It's a different address for

13:41.922 --> 13:43.354
Diana thomas.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.923
>> oh, look, who's that?

13:44.925 --> 13:45.857
>> there's a relative listed for

13:45.859 --> 13:47.458
Diana named anthony thomas.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.294
>> that would be tony.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.161
So we have a hit.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.062
Anthony.

13:51.064 --> 13:51.796
What are the chances?

13:51.798 --> 13:53.631
Tony thomas, a relative of

13:53.633 --> 13:54.499
Diana.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.134
>> so we have an address for

13:56.136 --> 13:58.503

14:02.175 --> 14:03.274
It's a strange connection,

14:03.276 --> 14:04.209
But it's something.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.210
>> but it's--it's a connection.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.644
>> okay, so hold on a second.

14:06.646 --> 14:07.812
Let's just search for

14:07.814 --> 14:08.913
Anthony thomas.

14:08.915 --> 14:13.251
"anthony thomas, cincinnati."

14:13.253 --> 14:14.686
Okay.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.788
Mug shot, anthony thomas.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.056
That's the first thing that

14:18.058 --> 14:18.990
Comes up.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.226
>> yeah, busted in 2011 when

14:21.228 --> 14:24.329
This relationship started.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.397
>> jeez.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.467
>> look, we found the picture of

14:29.469 --> 14:30.969
A guy who was arrested right

14:30.971 --> 14:33.171
Around the time that antwane

14:33.173 --> 14:34.839
Started talking to tony.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.342
So it's possible that this guy

14:37.344 --> 14:38.443
Had this phone number...

14:38.445 --> 14:39.310
>> right.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.347
>> got arrested soon thereafter.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.948
The phone was taken away,

14:43.950 --> 14:45.083
The number disconnected,

14:45.085 --> 14:46.451
And now--

14:46.453 --> 14:47.886
>> he's calling from a private

14:47.888 --> 14:48.653
Prison.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.520
>> now he's calling from a

14:49.522 --> 14:50.488
Pay phone in jail.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.657
>> let's see if calling from

14:52.659 --> 14:55.393
Prison--

14:55.395 --> 14:56.761
>> yeah, what does it come up as

14:56.763 --> 14:59.898
On caller I.D.?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.200
>> big jails use v.O.I.P.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.134
So the caller I.D. Would most

15:03.136 --> 15:06.170
Likely show up as private

15:06.172 --> 15:07.672
Since it's a vpn.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.140
Okay, so phone calls from prison

15:09.142 --> 15:10.608
Show up as either unavailable

15:10.610 --> 15:11.509
Or private.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.177
There is a real chance this guy

15:13.179 --> 15:14.012
Could be in jail.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.451

15:33.566 --> 15:35.333

15:35.335 --> 15:36.734

Phone number.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.336
>> great.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.470
Which is probably what happened

15:39.472 --> 15:40.371
When antwane tried it.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.306
>> when he tries to call.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.708
>> considering the unusual

15:43.710 --> 15:44.943
Circumstances of antwane's

15:44.945 --> 15:46.511
Relationship and that he can't

15:46.513 --> 15:49.180
Call tony, it's not ridiculous

15:49.182 --> 15:51.215
To think that maybe tony's in

15:51.217 --> 15:52.750
A minimum security prison.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.018
It's a lead.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.620
Antwane has been so wrapped up

15:55.622 --> 15:57.021
In his love affair, he hasn't

15:57.023 --> 15:58.790
Actually really taken the time

15:58.792 --> 16:01.693
To consider the circumstances

16:01.695 --> 16:04.195
And what he's involved in.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.898
So let's just be really careful
