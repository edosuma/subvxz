(crowd cheers on keyboard)

00:45.250 --> 00:49.000
-We are 30 Seconds to Math!
-Good night!

00:49.083 --> 00:51.291
Man, I cannot wait to win
the Battle of the Bands,

00:51.375 --> 00:53.083
and shove it in my sister's face!

00:53.166 --> 00:56.542
-She wins every year.
-Not this year.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.583
Tonight, 30 Seconds to Math

00:58.667 --> 01:00.458
joins Norrisville's rock elite,

01:00.542 --> 01:03.375
permanently markered on the Stall of Fame.

01:03.458 --> 01:05.041
Let's take it from the top.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.208
Sorry, boys.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.000
Got a Code Orange in my bucket here.

01:08.083 --> 01:10.458
I'd get outta splashin'
distance if I was you.

01:10.542 --> 01:11.834
(both groan)

01:11.917 --> 01:15.500
-(mumbling indistinctly)
-(humming)

01:15.583 --> 01:17.625
What's got five nipples

01:17.709 --> 01:19.875
and is gonna win the Battle of the Bands?

01:19.959 --> 01:21.166
(both) These guys!

01:21.250 --> 01:22.625
Lock it up!

01:23.375 --> 01:24.875
Now that we've locked it up,

01:24.959 --> 01:27.333
I'd like to take a moment
to talk to you about NNS.

01:27.417 --> 01:29.875
-NN what?
-Ninja No-Show.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.792
It's a friendship threatening condition

01:31.875 --> 01:34.125
where two bros are about
to do something awesome,

01:34.208 --> 01:37.417
but one bro ninjas out
and totally blows it!

01:37.500 --> 01:39.000
By the way, you're the ninja, bro.

01:39.083 --> 01:40.834
What? I don't do that!

01:43.166 --> 01:45.125
-Oh, NNS!
-(laughter)

01:45.208 --> 01:46.041
Swing!

01:46.667 --> 01:49.583
(humming, whistling)

01:52.208 --> 01:55.041
NNS!
(screaming)

01:55.125 --> 01:56.750
(both chortling)

01:58.417 --> 01:59.500
-NNS!
-(laughter)

01:59.583 --> 02:02.208
Ninja leap!

02:02.291 --> 02:05.166
Okay, you know
I may have NNS'd on occasion,

02:05.250 --> 02:08.166
but tonight's the Battle of the Bands.
No way will I NNS!

02:08.250 --> 02:11.792
Swear it, Cunningham!
Swear it on my beats!

02:11.875 --> 02:13.792
-(up-tempo beats playing)
-On your beats.

02:13.875 --> 02:16.875
Now let's go back in there
and get our rehearsal on!

02:16.959 --> 02:19.709
All yours, boys.
Try to breathe through your mouths.

02:19.792 --> 02:21.000
Maybe we should take a fiver.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.000
(stomach grumbles)

02:22.083 --> 02:23.458
Let's make it a tenner.

02:23.542 --> 02:25.583
-Gotta visit the Stall of Fame.
-(toilet flushes)

02:25.667 --> 02:27.417
Do not NNS!

02:27.500 --> 02:28.834
(panting)

02:28.917 --> 02:33.834
Robo-Ape? I can't NNS. I took a beat oath.

02:33.917 --> 02:36.542
Ten minutes... I can do this.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.458
Smoke bomb!

02:38.542 --> 02:40.458
I have no idea
what you Robo-Apes are up to,

02:40.542 --> 02:42.625
but I'm not gonna let you
get away with it.

02:42.709 --> 02:45.333
-Ninja slice!
-(grunts)

02:48.250 --> 02:49.083
Yah!

02:50.333 --> 02:51.417
Ninja kamas.

02:53.709 --> 02:55.917
-Oh-oh.
-Ninja scarf-stopper.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.917
Yah!

02:58.000 --> 02:59.917
Tell me what McFist's got cookin'.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.542
I don't know the whole menu.
I only handle appetizers.

03:02.625 --> 03:05.542
-That a joke, Robo-Ape?
-No, Ninja, we're caterers.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.291
We're catering the Battle of the Bands.

03:07.375 --> 03:11.667
(Randy) "McFist Finger Foods,
a division of McFist Industries"?

03:11.750 --> 03:14.041
Yeah, sure. If you guys are caterers,

03:14.125 --> 03:16.375
then how do you explain
this crate full of...

03:17.083 --> 03:18.917
...cocktail weenies.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.458
Well, looks my job here is... Smoke bomb!

03:23.041 --> 03:26.500
Hey, Howard. Everything good?
Fantastic. Okay, cool. Let's rock.

03:26.583 --> 03:27.917
One, two, three...

03:28.000 --> 03:30.125
-(fast-paced riff)
-Hmm...

03:30.208 --> 03:32.291
Howard, are you ready to rock or what?

03:32.375 --> 03:35.250
Oh, I was ready to rock...
a billion minutes ago.

03:35.333 --> 03:38.333
-There were these Robo-Apes...
-So you did NNS!

03:38.417 --> 03:40.709
Only a little.
It looked like they were up to something,

03:40.792 --> 03:42.792
but turns out they were up to nothing.
All good!

03:42.875 --> 03:45.041
Not good! That's a UNNS!

03:45.125 --> 03:47.959
-Hmm?
-Unnecessary Ninja No-Show!

03:48.041 --> 03:50.208
I am an awesome drum machinist,

03:50.291 --> 03:51.208
maybe the best ever,

03:51.291 --> 03:53.500
but I cannot battle those bands alone!

03:53.583 --> 03:56.208
You won't be alone. I won't NNS.

03:56.291 --> 03:57.875
-Robo-Ape!
-I'm on it.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.333
-Huh?
-I knew it!

04:01.417 --> 04:03.166
You didn't just break a beat oath,

04:03.250 --> 04:07.083
-you broke up our band.
-Howard...

04:07.166 --> 04:08.250
(grumbles)

04:08.959 --> 04:09.917
(groans)

04:11.208 --> 04:12.834
What the juice, Nomicon?

04:12.917 --> 04:14.709
I try to be a good ninja, fail.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.458
I try to be a good friend, double fail.

04:16.542 --> 04:18.000
What am I supposed to do?

04:21.667 --> 04:23.500
(screaming)

04:26.125 --> 04:27.875
(laughing)

04:27.959 --> 04:30.959
"Friendship is a weight
the ninja cannot carry."

04:32.500 --> 04:35.709
Forget it, Nomicon.
That is all kinds of wrong.

04:36.917 --> 04:38.583
(roaring)

04:39.500 --> 04:40.750
(shouts, groans)

04:40.834 --> 04:44.417
(Viceroy) The ninja just took down
our entire catering division.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.375
This is a disaster!

04:46.458 --> 04:49.041
I'll say, it's the height
of Bar Mitzvah season.

04:49.125 --> 04:51.875
We need a new way
to smuggle the True-hickey

04:52.000 --> 04:56.291
-into the Battle of the Bands.
-It's called a Truth Tone.

04:56.375 --> 04:59.458
It resonates at a frequency
which tickles the truth-lobe

04:59.542 --> 05:00.709
of your fallacy cortex.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.000
So when the ninja hears it...

05:02.083 --> 05:04.542
He'll be forced to tell us who he is.
I know how it works!

05:04.625 --> 05:07.333
Yo, McFist, I need new turntables.
Gimme money.

05:07.417 --> 05:10.291
What happened to the ones
I bought you last week?

05:10.375 --> 05:11.959
-Jumped on 'em!
-(straining)

05:12.041 --> 05:15.333
Hannibal, perhaps you should give
the boy some turntables.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.792
I'm trying to teach the boy
responsibility here.

05:17.875 --> 05:22.166
Where's your money hole?
Whoo-hoo! Found it!

05:22.250 --> 05:23.917
(chortling)

05:26.208 --> 05:29.917
-What's the secret numbers?
-Ha! Like I'd ever tell you!

05:30.000 --> 05:31.250
(tone plays)

05:31.333 --> 05:34.542
Forty-six, 23, 44, 14.
Why'd I just tell him?

05:34.625 --> 05:38.125
Whoo! Jackpot!
(laughs)

05:38.208 --> 05:40.125
Nice work, Viceroy!

05:40.208 --> 05:42.500
Now he's going to buy
new turntables, and...

05:42.583 --> 05:46.500
...we can plant the Truth Phone on them
at the Battle of the Bands!

05:46.583 --> 05:49.166
-This is my best plan ever!
-Your plan? But I...

05:49.250 --> 05:50.083
(groans)

05:50.166 --> 05:52.291
<i>-♪ Who are my bro's, yo? ♪</i>
<i>-♪ We're your bro's, yo ♪</i>

05:52.375 --> 05:54.500
<i>-♪ Who are my bro's, yo? ♪</i>
<i>-♪ We're your bro's, yo ♪</i>

05:54.583 --> 05:56.875
<i>-♪ Who are my bro's, yo? ♪</i>
<i>-♪ We're your bro's, yo! ♪</i>

05:56.959 --> 05:58.542
Man, they are bro's.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.375
That's why they're so good...

06:00.458 --> 06:03.125
(Randy) I know a power synth duo
that can beat 'em.

06:05.083 --> 06:06.417
'Course the drum machinist

06:06.500 --> 06:09.125
would have to forgive the keytar player
for being a total wonk.

06:09.208 --> 06:11.417
How do I know I can trust you?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.417
Because the Nomicon told me
not to be here.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.166
-But I'm here.
-I never liked that book.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.458
<i>-♪ Who are my bro's, yo? ♪</i>
<i>-♪ We're your bro's, yo ♪</i>

06:17.542 --> 06:20.000
<i>-♪ Who are my bro's, yo? ♪</i>
<i>-♪ We're your bro's, yo ♪</i>

06:20.083 --> 06:22.417
- <i>♪ Who are my bro's, yo? ♪</i>
-Get ready for it, Viceroy.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.792
Bash is about to play the truth frequency.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.208
(McFist) The ninja will soon be ours!

06:28.625 --> 06:32.125
It appears Bash is having
a turntable malfunction.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.250
He's having a brain malfunction!

06:34.333 --> 06:36.709
Find an act with an instrument that works.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.583
My guitar is missing! Has anybody seen it?

06:40.667 --> 06:43.625
Dark pink with light pink skulls,
pink strap that says "Heidi Weinerman"

06:43.709 --> 06:45.500
-in hot pink letters...
-Huh?

06:46.917 --> 06:48.542
(Randy) What the juice?

06:48.625 --> 06:49.709
(groans)

06:51.959 --> 06:53.834
No, I will not NNS.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.792
I'll check it out and be back
before Howard even notices.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.458
Hey, I got a surprise for you.

07:01.542 --> 07:03.500
Remember my awesome drum solo?

07:03.583 --> 07:07.208
It's now three minutes awesomer, buddy.
Buddy?

07:08.041 --> 07:10.208
Are you kidding me? We are done!

07:10.291 --> 07:12.959
(techno music plays)

07:14.792 --> 07:15.959
Smoke bomb!

07:16.041 --> 07:18.834
I'm pretty sure that guitar
doesn't belong to you.

07:18.917 --> 07:21.500
-Heidi said we could borrow it?
-You're lying, Robo-Ape.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.291
And now you're getting ninja punched!

07:23.375 --> 07:26.667
(shouting)
Yah!

07:30.583 --> 07:32.709
(growling)
Get him.

07:33.291 --> 07:36.583
Up next is the 9th grade powersynth duo,

07:36.667 --> 07:39.709
-30 Seconds to Math!
-(audience cheers)

07:39.792 --> 07:41.709
(whispering)
We're done. The band's broken up.

07:41.792 --> 07:42.667
He Yoko Ono'd.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.875
Apparently 30 Seconds to Math
has broken up,

07:44.959 --> 07:46.208
something to do with betrayal

07:46.291 --> 07:49.417
and "that selfish wonk,
Randy Cunningham," so...

07:49.500 --> 07:53.041
Put your hands together
for Julian and his creepy theremin!

07:54.083 --> 07:57.083
(eerie music plays)

07:57.583 --> 08:00.375
Boo! I said, "Boo."

08:07.083 --> 08:08.333
Yah!

08:11.458 --> 08:12.709
(screeching)

08:12.792 --> 08:15.834
I have a sword, you have monkey hands.
Hardly seems fair.

08:16.792 --> 08:17.917
Okay, that's fair.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.583
(grunting)

08:22.750 --> 08:24.125
(growling)

08:30.041 --> 08:31.208
Uh, what's with the whisk?

08:31.291 --> 08:33.250
I was designed to run the omelet bar.

08:34.083 --> 08:35.750
Ow, that stings.

08:35.834 --> 08:39.709
Stupid Cunningham reunites the band
just to break it up again.

08:39.792 --> 08:41.542
Aw, I dropped my pluot!

08:41.625 --> 08:43.667
This day just keeps getting worse.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.291
(McFist) Robo-Apes have gone missing,

08:45.375 --> 08:48.583
and you still haven't planted
our musical mind-control device!

08:48.667 --> 08:49.709
Haven't I...

08:49.792 --> 08:52.125
As soon as she hits the right frequency,

08:52.208 --> 08:55.166
we'll pop the question,
and the ninja will out himself.

08:55.250 --> 08:58.000
(gasps)
I gotta warn that jerk, Randy.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.750
Yah! Ninja rings.

09:08.041 --> 09:09.291
What's up, N-Ville!

09:09.375 --> 09:12.500
I would like to dedicate my song
to whoever returned my guitar.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.041
This jam is about the ninja.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.125
While we can't all be the ninja,

09:16.208 --> 09:18.625
if we work super hard
and totally together,

09:18.709 --> 09:20.208
we can all be a little bit like him.

09:20.291 --> 09:22.625
(panting)

09:22.709 --> 09:23.750
(screams)

09:27.834 --> 09:29.583
You need to get out of here, Cunningham.

09:29.667 --> 09:32.625
I know you're mad,
and you have every right to be... Hey!

09:32.709 --> 09:37.375

09:37.917 --> 09:43.375

09:43.875 --> 09:45.959
<i>♪ You've got the ninja in you ♪</i>

09:46.041 --> 09:47.917
Stop pushing me, I'm trying to apologize!

09:48.000 --> 09:50.500
Save it! Right now you need to leave.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.250
Bad stuff is gonna happen.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.291
You mean the Robo-Apes?
I took care of that.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.834
That's why I ninja no-showed, and...

09:56.917 --> 09:59.333
Why are you cramming cupcakes in my ear?

09:59.417 --> 10:02.417

10:12.667 --> 10:15.792
(clears throat)
Check, two. One, two. Check, two.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.291
Who is the ninja?

10:19.208 --> 10:21.834
I'm the ninja! Why did I say that?

10:21.917 --> 10:24.166
-(groans, moans)
-(bell rings)

10:24.250 --> 10:25.667
And I am the ninja!

10:25.750 --> 10:28.125
And you're the ninja.
And you're the ninja.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.333
And you're the ninja.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.458
There's a ninja inside us all!

10:32.542 --> 10:34.625
(all) I am the ninja. I am the ninja.

10:34.709 --> 10:36.625
I am the ninja. I am the ninja.

10:36.709 --> 10:38.667
They can't all be the ninja!

10:38.750 --> 10:41.709
They genuinely believe
the ninja is inside them.

10:41.792 --> 10:46.333
(grumbling)
We've been bested by a catchy pop hook!

10:46.417 --> 10:50.917
- <i>♪There's a ninja inside us all ♪</i>
-(all) I am the ninja.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.208
-Howard, now I'll never win!
-Rock and roll!

10:57.333 --> 10:58.583
Listen, Howard...

10:58.667 --> 11:01.333
The Nomicon told me
a ninja can't have friends,

11:01.417 --> 11:03.667
but no ninja's ever had a friend like you.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.709
Uh, are we gonna rock?

11:05.792 --> 11:07.875
'Cause this is startin' to get awkward.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.667
-(synth music plays)
-Prepare your ears for...

11:10.750 --> 11:12.792
(both) 30 Seconds to Math!

11:12.875 --> 11:16.500
<i>♪ Detention deficit disorder ♪</i>

11:17.083 --> 11:18.083
(birds cawing)

11:18.166 --> 11:20.166
(drum music plays)

11:20.250 --> 11:21.375
Yah!

11:26.250 --> 11:30.583
-(roars)
-One of us picked a bad day

11:30.667 --> 11:32.959
to be a Komodo Dragon in shogun armor.

11:33.041 --> 11:36.250
Prepare to get air fisted. Okay.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.125
First, separate the clouds...

11:38.208 --> 11:41.083
-(roars)
-...gather the fallen wind...

11:42.500 --> 11:45.000
...and free the chicken.

11:45.083 --> 11:48.458
(laughing)
I can't, I can't! Free the chicken?

11:48.542 --> 11:50.542
What am I supposed to do with that?

11:50.625 --> 11:53.250
(grunts)
Alright, alright, alright.

11:53.333 --> 11:56.125
Clouds, wind, chicken.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.959
(chortles)
Chicken!

11:58.041 --> 12:00.250
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm gonna do it this time for real.

12:02.667 --> 12:05.083
(roars)

12:06.875 --> 12:08.083
Come on, Nomicon!

12:08.166 --> 12:11.000
The air fist is ruining my ninja steeze!

12:11.083 --> 12:13.834
"Respect is the key that opens all doors."

12:13.917 --> 12:16.333
OK, one, who said anything about doors?

12:16.417 --> 12:17.583
That's completely off-topic.

12:17.667 --> 12:21.667
And, two, nobody's gonna respect the ninja
if he looks like a chicken-tossing shoob.

12:23.709 --> 12:24.709
Whoa...

12:24.792 --> 12:27.375
Just sayin'. Huh?

12:29.375 --> 12:30.417
(alarm wails)

12:30.500 --> 12:33.250
We're under attack!
There's a monster on campus!

12:33.333 --> 12:35.500
Everybody leave your belongings
and exit the building.

12:35.583 --> 12:38.083
(all screaming)

12:38.875 --> 12:42.709
-Ah! What the juice?
-You got a death wish, kid?

12:42.792 --> 12:44.667
Nothing in that bag is worth dying for.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.125
Come on, it's just right there...

12:46.208 --> 12:48.041
-Aah!
-And the exit is right there!

12:48.125 --> 12:49.500
Alright, alright.

12:50.875 --> 12:52.250
Move it!

12:52.333 --> 12:53.250
(all shouting)

12:53.333 --> 12:54.917
We're all doomed!

12:55.000 --> 12:58.250
-Finally! Doomed!
-Push, shove, trample!

12:58.333 --> 13:01.959
Help! Don't panic, I'm sure
the ninja will be here any minute.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.041
I mean, he's probably
just a little held up...

13:06.041 --> 13:08.667
-It's the ninja.
-Me? I'm not...

13:08.750 --> 13:10.834
-Why would you even think that?
-We're saved!

13:11.917 --> 13:13.417
What the ninja?

13:14.792 --> 13:17.417
-Students of Norrisville.
-Huh?

13:20.208 --> 13:22.834
-Check it out!
-Weinerman?

13:22.917 --> 13:24.375
Yeah, we're all dead.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.291
Why are you dressed like that?

13:26.375 --> 13:27.917
Yup. Monster Drill.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.834
And guess who Slimovitz
picked to be the ninja?

13:30.917 --> 13:32.959
Spoiler alert... It's me.

13:33.041 --> 13:35.500
(laughing)

13:35.583 --> 13:37.834
This is so funny, it's beyond funny.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.250
I know, I know.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.417
I mean, you're lazy, you're slow,

13:42.500 --> 13:46.709
-you don't like to sweat.
-I don't! I really don't!

13:46.792 --> 13:49.333
You as a ninja... You as a ninja!

13:49.417 --> 13:53.208
Ha, I know... yes... me...

13:54.542 --> 13:57.083
That suit. You look ridiculous.

13:57.166 --> 14:00.500
-It's not that funny.
-It is, it really is.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.625
Best. Surprise. Ever.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.542
I have not laughed this hard
in a long time.

14:05.625 --> 14:08.166
You as the ninja... This is awesome!

14:09.458 --> 14:10.750
Wait, you're not mad, are you?

14:10.834 --> 14:13.750
No! No, I'm not mad. I'm not mad at all.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.000
Now, if you're finished,

14:15.083 --> 14:18.083
I have to take my ridiculous self
to the Monster Drill.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.959
See that sounds like mad.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.792
(Viceroy) Oh, Francesca.

14:21.875 --> 14:25.166
Will you and the stable boy
ever find true love?

14:25.250 --> 14:27.583
Viceroy, what are you doing?

14:27.667 --> 14:30.917
You have reached Viceroy.
I can't get to the phone

14:31.000 --> 14:33.500
because I'm attempting to enjoy
the only day of vacation

14:33.583 --> 14:35.750
my unethical boss gives me each year.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.875
Leave a message after the tone.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.917
-Tone.
-Quit messing around!

14:40.000 --> 14:42.333
The Slaying Mantis
just came back from the shop.

14:42.417 --> 14:43.917
I want to take it out for a spin.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.625
You know, kick the tires.
Destroy the ninja.

14:46.709 --> 14:50.375
And I'd be more than happy
to do that... when I get back.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.625
Fine I'll do it myself!

14:53.709 --> 14:57.917
It doesn't take an evil genius
to drive a tactical assault arthropod.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.917
Ha-ha!

15:03.333 --> 15:07.166
-You forgot to open the case.
-Aren't you on vacation?

15:07.250 --> 15:11.083
Welcome to Norrisville High's
annual Monster Drill.

15:11.166 --> 15:14.583
Had this been a real attack,
you would've all been monstered.

15:14.667 --> 15:19.875
Which is why we're gonna practice having
a safe day, the NINJA way.

15:19.959 --> 15:22.125
(Slimovitz) "N. Nobody panic."

15:22.208 --> 15:25.083
"I. I insist, nobody panic."

15:25.166 --> 15:27.000
"N. Nobody,

15:27.083 --> 15:29.000
and I mean nobody panic."

15:29.083 --> 15:32.250
"J. Just don't panic, nobody."

15:32.333 --> 15:34.917
And I can't stress this last one
highly enough,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.041
"A. And get out of the ninja's way."

15:38.125 --> 15:40.500
C'mon, Howard, don't be so sensitive.

15:40.583 --> 15:42.583
This is our thing. This is what we do!

15:42.667 --> 15:44.250
Oh, no, Cunningham.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.125
This time you crossed the line!

15:46.208 --> 15:48.834
So now that you know
what to do in a monster attack,

15:48.917 --> 15:51.542
let's practice. Where is my monster?

15:51.625 --> 15:55.542
-(roars)
-Save it for the show, Bucky.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.041
(straining)

15:57.125 --> 15:59.709
Stupid monster hands. I'm all claws.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.250
(indistinct chattering)

16:01.333 --> 16:03.208
You promised a monster!

16:03.291 --> 16:04.625
I'm getting wicked bored!

16:04.709 --> 16:06.583
I'm gonna start acting out soon.

16:06.667 --> 16:09.125
(all) Boring, boring...

16:09.208 --> 16:12.041
My monster's running late. Stall!

16:12.125 --> 16:13.917
I got your back, P-Slimmy.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.959
S'up, Norrisville! I am the ninja!

16:17.041 --> 16:19.542
I think I'm better than everyone else.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.500
I do unnecessary flips.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.542
I'm a huge show off.

16:23.625 --> 16:26.083
His flips are totally unnecessary.

16:26.166 --> 16:29.000
One time I saw him run
on the ceiling for no reason.

16:29.083 --> 16:30.291
I'm sure he had a reason.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.250
Nobody runs on the ceiling for no reason.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.792
I do more damage to this school

16:34.875 --> 16:36.417
-than the monsters.
-(laughter)

16:36.500 --> 16:38.667
-My car could tell you that.
-(car horn beeps)

16:38.750 --> 16:40.208
I'm 800 years old,

16:40.291 --> 16:43.125
which was the last time
this scarf was in style.

16:43.208 --> 16:46.083
(humming)

16:46.166 --> 16:49.166
Hey! The scarf is a serious ninja tool!

16:49.250 --> 16:52.333
Plus it's cool! It's cool!

16:52.417 --> 16:55.125
Hey, everybody. Smoke bomb!

16:55.208 --> 16:57.375
-(flatulence)
-(all laugh)

16:58.208 --> 17:00.834
This guy's way funnier
than the real ninja.

17:00.917 --> 17:05.709
Left! No wait, right!
(groans)

17:05.792 --> 17:07.792
Why did you give this thing bug eyes?

17:07.875 --> 17:09.333
Never gives me a problem.

17:15.542 --> 17:17.750
There, got it! Onward!

17:20.458 --> 17:23.208
-You smashed a...
-I know!

17:24.125 --> 17:26.750
Ooh! Look at my ninja rings.

17:26.834 --> 17:30.083
I'm the prettiest ninja
in all of ninjaland!

17:31.500 --> 17:36.166
Clearly, the ninja upset you in some way,
and I'm sure he's really sorry about it.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.458
Oh, he's gonna be sorry.
I'm just getting started.

17:39.542 --> 17:42.291
(roaring)

17:42.375 --> 17:44.375
Finally, our practice monster.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.750
Kudos to Mr. Smith's metal shop class.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.792
Okay, places everyone, and remember,

17:50.875 --> 17:54.000
-N. Nobody panic!
-Alright, alright.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.834
I'm gonna have to get knocked around
by this thing a few times

17:56.917 --> 17:58.959
before I learn how to beat it.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.458
Huh? Whoa, wait a minute.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.500
Mr. Smith's class
can't even build a birdhouse.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.625
(chirping)

18:09.834 --> 18:12.041
-(shouts)
-(Hannibal) Outta my way, kid!

18:12.125 --> 18:13.250
(gasps)
McFist.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.083
Looks like it's ninja time...

18:15.166 --> 18:17.375
My suit's in the library!

18:19.625 --> 18:22.291
Get ready to taste ninja sword!

18:23.166 --> 18:24.000
(groans)

18:24.083 --> 18:25.750
Why's he waggling that salami at us?

18:25.834 --> 18:27.792
Does the ninja look different to you?

18:27.875 --> 18:30.208
All ninjas look the same to me.

18:30.375 --> 18:33.709
Sector two is student-free,
moving on to sector three.

18:33.792 --> 18:35.625
-Hey, that rhymes.
-Screech!

18:36.375 --> 18:38.834
Hiyah! Hiyah!

18:38.917 --> 18:41.959
Try to stay on your feet, Hensletter.
We've got a crowd to entertain here.

18:42.041 --> 18:45.959
Ninja whap!
(humming)

18:46.625 --> 18:47.917
That was humiliating.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.333
I could come back early
from my one lousy day off to help,

18:51.417 --> 18:55.500
but in return, I'd need,
oh, say, an extra two weeks of vacation.

18:55.583 --> 18:58.291
-Never!
-Time for a smoke bomb.

18:59.125 --> 19:00.500
-(zipper unzipping)
-Ew... Fine!

19:00.583 --> 19:03.291
Whatever you want.
Two weeks. Just get in here!

19:03.375 --> 19:04.709
Mm-hmm.

19:06.208 --> 19:07.834
(screams)

19:07.917 --> 19:10.917
(grunts)
Wow! Nice move, you two.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.333
(woman) Moving on to sector L.

19:13.417 --> 19:15.166
(girl) Just take the gloves off, Bucky.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.667
(Bucky) If I lose the character,
I'll never get it back.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.583
(panting)
Hello ninja-o-clock!

19:21.750 --> 19:23.417
Ow.

19:24.333 --> 19:26.834
And that's why we don't run in the halls.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.250
Ooh. Hey, band geeks,
take it down a notch!

19:31.333 --> 19:32.625
This was the deli's last sword.

19:33.917 --> 19:34.959
(Slimovitz) My car!

19:37.208 --> 19:39.583
-Missiles, really?
-That's a real monster!

19:39.667 --> 19:43.959
Real monster! Everybody panic!

19:44.041 --> 19:47.375
-You gotta let me go!
-I don't gotta do anything.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.417
I'm a certified band instructor,

19:49.500 --> 19:52.083
and you have no respect for the baton.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.250
No respect for the rules.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.041
No respect.

19:56.125 --> 19:59.333
Respect is the key that opens all doors.

19:59.417 --> 20:01.583
-What'd you say to me?
-You're right.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.250
I wasn't respecting the baton,

20:03.333 --> 20:06.542
or Howard, or the Nomicon, or anything!

20:06.625 --> 20:10.208
-It's all about respect.
-I finally got through to one.

20:10.291 --> 20:12.959
-(shouts)
-(grunts)

20:14.875 --> 20:16.709
I'm not the ninja! Not the ninja!
(grunts)

20:16.792 --> 20:18.959
(all screaming)

20:19.542 --> 20:20.834
Smoke bomb!

20:21.458 --> 20:23.917
-The real ninja!
-You gotta save us!

20:24.000 --> 20:25.625
This drill stinks!

20:26.709 --> 20:28.333
(yells)

20:29.500 --> 20:31.834
(grunts)
Separate the clouds,

20:31.917 --> 20:33.333
gather the fallen wind...

20:33.417 --> 20:36.750
Ha-ha! Looks like the ninja's makin'
a Mr. Grumpy.

20:36.834 --> 20:38.500
Right? Am I right?

20:38.583 --> 20:40.083
Come on, you know I'm right.

20:40.166 --> 20:41.959
Tuning them out, focusing,

20:42.041 --> 20:44.166
freeing the chicken...

20:44.834 --> 20:46.625
And ninja air fist!

20:48.834 --> 20:50.834
Sorry! I was aiming for the mantis.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.792
(growling)

20:56.000 --> 20:57.667
Ninja stab! Ninja stab! Ninja stab!

20:57.750 --> 21:00.417
Ninja dodge! Ninja dodge! Ninja dodge!

21:00.500 --> 21:03.667
(muttering, grunting)

21:07.625 --> 21:09.542
(both moaning)

21:10.250 --> 21:12.959
Howard, sorry about earlier.
I shouldn't have said that stuff.

21:13.041 --> 21:15.000
I don't think you being the ninja
is ridiculous.

21:15.083 --> 21:17.583
No, it is! It's completely ridiculous!

21:17.667 --> 21:19.166
I don't wanna be the ninja anymore.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.542
You be the ninja.
And it was more about your tone...

21:21.625 --> 21:23.458
(screams)

21:25.709 --> 21:29.083
You can take my swords,
but you'll never take my air fist!

21:29.166 --> 21:30.959
(cheering)

21:33.542 --> 21:36.000
-What are you lookin' at?
-I'll be takin' those two weeks

21:36.083 --> 21:37.875
startin' now, if you don't mind.

21:37.959 --> 21:39.291
Mmm-hmm.

21:40.125 --> 21:45.291
(humming)
Brrr.

21:47.375 --> 21:48.792
Mmm, that's cold.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.792
-(all) Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
-Drill's over.

21:51.875 --> 21:54.667
-Back to class.
-(moaning)

21:54.750 --> 21:57.417
Howard, I want you to know I respect you,

21:57.500 --> 21:59.166
but I'm still gonna make fun of you.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.125
Wouldn't have it any other way.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.917
-Nice scarf.
-It came with the suit!

22:04.000 --> 22:06.709
Grr! We are the monster!

22:06.792 --> 22:09.041
-Monster!
-Air fist!

22:10.250 --> 22:11.291
(both moan)

22:11.375 --> 22:13.625
-That smarts.
-Uh-oh. Now what?

22:13.709 --> 22:15.000
I'm thinkin' smoke bomb.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.792
You know what? I respect that.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.166
Smoke bomb!

22:18.750 --> 22:22.458
(theme music playing)
