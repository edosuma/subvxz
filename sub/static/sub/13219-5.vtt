13:05.852 --> 13:07.552
which exist
in our communities.

13:07.554 --> 13:11.022
-You really want my job?
-Not the way you do it.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.424
All right, I didn't make
the world and neither did you.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.592
No, but we can change it.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.461
Well, okay.
Well, let's change it later.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.396
Or do you want a killer
running loose around here?

13:18.398 --> 13:20.632
What are you gonna do about
the murder of Michael Younger?

13:20.634 --> 13:22.834
-What about Younger?
-That's not my case.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.402
But I will look into it
and maybe it will...

13:24.404 --> 13:28.439
Point seven.
We want an immediate end
to police brutality.

13:28.441 --> 13:28.873
ALL: Now!

13:28.875 --> 13:30.375
-We believe that the racist...
-That's seven out of 10.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.343
...and fascist government
of the United States...

13:32.345 --> 13:33.745
-Ten points?
-...uses its domestic

13:33.747 --> 13:36.447
-enforcement agencies
to carry out its programs...
-I got lunch.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.483
...of oppression
against black people,

13:38.485 --> 13:43.254
other people of color,
and poor people inside
the United States.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.257
<i> We believe it is our right,</i>
<i> therefore, to defend ourselves</i>

13:46.259 --> 13:50.161
<i> against these fascist</i>
<i> police forces!</i>

13:50.931 --> 13:55.400
You're really letting me
go to school like
nothing happened?

13:55.702 --> 13:57.902
Nothing did happen.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.273
I love you.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.743
I love you more
than you can know.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.515
It got hard
when you got older.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.650
It seemed like one day
you were so quiet,

14:12.652 --> 14:14.619
and you used to be so...

14:15.488 --> 14:17.755
Do you remember
how much we laughed?

14:17.757 --> 14:19.724
Our tea parties?
(CHUCKLES)

14:19.726 --> 14:21.960
You wanted to be
everyone except Alice.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.795
-Alice was so...
-BOTH: Boring.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.597
You said, remember?

14:27.667 --> 14:29.667
I remember, Mom.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.847
(SIGHS)

14:46.920 --> 14:49.254
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

14:56.796 --> 14:59.931
Hey. No playing hooky.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.166
Not while Joe Wilson's
on duty.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.402
What? Who are you?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.104
I'm your new babysitter.

15:06.873 --> 15:10.241
MANSON: <i> It's gonna be</i>
<i> a beautiful thing, Sadie.</i>

15:10.243 --> 15:12.877
I just wish I could
be there to behold.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.780
You're always
with me, Charlie.

15:22.989 --> 15:25.023
"The devotion of the greatest

15:25.025 --> 15:28.226
"is to encounter
risk and danger

15:28.228 --> 15:30.628
"and play dice for death."

15:34.935 --> 15:37.035
Yeah, nice 'do.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.771
You know, you are allowed
to come in the front door.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.074
I was hoping maybe
you had a drive-through
by now.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.577
What do you want, Sam?

15:48.682 --> 15:51.649
You know anything
about who burned Cass?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.487
You know, we got a great
chicken pot pie today.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.489
Your old friend Cass.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.325
Burger's always good.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.127
Oh.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.929
So you're a black man.

16:05.231 --> 16:08.499
Bunchy Carter told me that
no black man, woman, or child

16:08.501 --> 16:10.234
would help me
find Cass' killer.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.402
I didn't want to believe him.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.305
I didn't want to believe
that you would let
his killer go free.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.875
You know what, Sam?
You're right.
I'm a black man.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.377
Yes, and, Nate,
I'm your friend.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.347
No, no, no.
You are not my friend.

16:22.349 --> 16:22.780
I like you, Sam.

16:22.782 --> 16:26.217
But yet and still
we ain't never gonna
be friends for real.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.687
Ask Hannah.

16:29.689 --> 16:33.091
Hannah Weinraub?
Still lives here?

16:33.193 --> 16:34.225
Yeah.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.362
And she still knows
everything. (CHUCKLES)

16:39.499 --> 16:42.800
Where's the fire?
Why the radio call?

16:42.802 --> 16:44.435
Billy Ray, Cass' son.

16:44.437 --> 16:47.338
Witness saw him leaving
15 minutes before the fire

16:47.340 --> 16:50.308
and spray-painting
"slave hair burns."

16:50.710 --> 16:51.676
No, he didn't.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.944
How the hell
do you know he didn't?

16:52.946 --> 16:56.514
'Cause Billy Ray died
in Vietnam six months ago.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.149
Who said they saw him?

16:59.986 --> 17:01.386
Hannah Weinraub.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.488
(LAUGHS) Senile Hannah?

17:03.490 --> 17:04.555
That's your witness?

17:04.557 --> 17:06.257
Who else did she
tell you she saw?

17:06.259 --> 17:06.991
Sammy Davis, Jr.?

17:06.993 --> 17:09.360
Who the hell is
investigating this kid

17:09.362 --> 17:11.129
that Bunchy
keeps talking about?

17:11.131 --> 17:13.164
The murder. Michael Younger?

17:13.166 --> 17:15.533
-I don't know.
-You don't know.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.035
And you don't know
why Bunchy thinks

17:17.037 --> 17:18.269
you had something
to do with it.

17:18.271 --> 17:21.105
That I do know.
I told you, the kid liked me.

17:21.107 --> 17:21.906
Ran errands for me.

17:21.908 --> 17:25.576
You know, kind gestures
from friendly merchants.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.046
Brown paper bags
full of cash.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.113
Yeah, sure.

17:29.115 --> 17:31.682
I'm gonna let sambo
collect my take.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.286
So you're telling me that this
kid was your buddy on the beat

17:35.288 --> 17:38.856
and you don't know who's
investigating his murder?

17:39.192 --> 17:42.226
Detective,
I'm not a detective.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.596
Who you been talking to?
The Black Pimps?

17:45.999 --> 17:49.133
Younger was a good kid who
liked cops and wound up dead,

17:49.135 --> 17:51.502
probably 'cause he
liked cops.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.307
Anything else
on your mind, Sherlock?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.814
Son of a bitch.

taken care of for you.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.660
Hey, handsome.
Welcome back.

18:15.662 --> 18:16.894
Thanks, Mrs. Gladner.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.797
What did I tell you?
Lucille.

18:19.799 --> 18:20.898
Lucille. Sorry.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.701
The girls will be so happy
to see you.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.003
Girls, look who's back.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.839
Your college sweetheart.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.808
Lucky girl gets pinned, huh?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.644
So what'll it be?
The usual?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.480
Thanks, Lucille.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.617
Jimmy Too!

18:39.619 --> 18:41.886
JIMMY: Lucille.
LUCILLE: Hey, handsome.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.155
You look... Muah, muah.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.591
-Welcome back.
-Look at you in that dress.

SHAFE: <i> Guess who I clocked?</i>
SAM: <i> Who?</i>

18:48.461 --> 18:51.529
-Jimmy Butano, Jr.
-Little Jimmy Too.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.998
Yeah. Jimmy's pop was
Manson's cellie at Terminal.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.835
And I'm wondering did
big daddy Butano

18:57.837 --> 18:59.937
intro junior
to his cellmate?

19:00.006 --> 19:01.372
Manson?
Anything's possible.

19:01.374 --> 19:04.976
Yeah, well, I think
I'll drop Manson's name,
talk up the spiral.

19:04.978 --> 19:08.079
Just need that one
little vouch to put
Junior's mind at ease.

19:08.081 --> 19:11.649
Your boy, Vickery.
He moved enough
dope for Gladner

19:11.651 --> 19:13.551
and he sure owes you.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.887
You know, you're not
as dumb as your haircut.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.789
Gee. We're bonding.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.124
Hmm.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.025
Sam, you heard the news?

19:21.027 --> 19:22.593
They're gonna
operate on Priore.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.263
Take out his gall bladder.
That's what knocked him out.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.732
-It's infected or something.
-Is it serious?

19:27.734 --> 19:30.835
Serious enough for Dunne
to make me acting lieutenant.

19:31.905 --> 19:34.572
Got to admit
I was wrong, Cut.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.575
Kissing ass does pay off.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.944
Ah, you're a regular
Don Rickles, Sammy.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.445
Now that you're the pope
of pushing paper,

19:41.447 --> 19:42.813
maybe you can tell me
who the hell's

19:42.815 --> 19:44.782
working this
Michael Younger case.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.450
Yeah, I never heard of it.

19:46.452 --> 19:50.588
My advice...
Stick to your unsolved cases.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.324
'Cause you got
enough of those.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.227
-Who's Michael Younger?
-I don't know.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.930
I'm trying to find out
who killed a friend of mine.

19:58.932 --> 20:01.532
A negro.
Hard working businessman.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.067
Credit to his race.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.068
Hey, listen, wise guy.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.337
When I was a rook,
Cass and I were buddies.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.573
He used to keep a bottle
of Jack Daniel's for me

20:08.575 --> 20:12.143
and we'd bitch
about...everything.

20:15.815 --> 20:16.948
Remember Bunchy Carter?

20:16.950 --> 20:18.983
He calls himself
a Black Panther now.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.052
All Bunchy and the cat people
want to talk about

20:21.054 --> 20:22.920
is Michael Younger,
so I figure if I can turn

20:22.922 --> 20:25.389
the corner on that,
then maybe I can catch

20:25.391 --> 20:26.791
some goodwill on Cass.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.527
'Cause I need it
and Cass deserves it.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.297
I can look into
Younger for you.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.298
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.734
Don't look so surprised.
I'm a cop.

20:37.170 --> 20:38.603
You're a what?

20:39.105 --> 20:41.038
I'm a... I'm a cop.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.306
You are?

20:43.243 --> 20:45.142
This is Michael Younger.

20:55.321 --> 20:56.821
Choke hold?

21:03.863 --> 21:05.196
SAM: <i> You found something?</i>

21:05.198 --> 21:07.798
Michael Younger,
15 years old,

21:07.800 --> 21:09.667
put in a choke hold
until he passed out.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.403
Coroner says carotid artery
didn't reopen

21:12.405 --> 21:13.638
and he suffocated.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.041
You know what they call
a choke hold in South Central?

21:17.610 --> 21:19.043
Cop hold.

21:20.013 --> 21:22.546
But why did Tolson
choke his own gofer?

21:22.548 --> 21:24.248
His Fresca was warm?

21:24.250 --> 21:26.050
I called the detective
on the case.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.285
Who's that?

21:27.287 --> 21:28.419
Len Burns.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.821
"Lead Butt" Burns? Ah.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.024
Said no witnesses,
no leads.

21:33.026 --> 21:34.025
It's at the bottom
of his stack.

21:34.027 --> 21:36.093
Lenny Burns?
His whole stack
is at the bottom.

21:36.095 --> 21:39.797
He hasn't solved
a case since Tricky Dick
was vice president.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.799
No wonder Bunchy's pissed.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.434
I'll keep working on it.

a million.

for your lazy rhymes, Charlie.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.484
But first thing
tomorrow morning,

22:00.486 --> 22:02.486
you don't call my office.

22:02.588 --> 22:03.854
Fear.

22:04.223 --> 22:08.225
Nothing better than seeing
fear in their eyes, huh?

22:09.028 --> 22:11.295
That first time
when you hit 'em

22:11.631 --> 22:14.398
so hard they just crumple up.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.202
Banyin likes to meet 'em.

22:18.771 --> 22:22.273
Meet 'em, greet 'em,
and beat 'em.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.377
And when she knows...

22:26.379 --> 22:29.180
When she really knows
Banyin ain't...

22:35.755 --> 22:37.021
Yeah, Charlie.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.724
You taught me
what I truly enjoy.

22:40.259 --> 22:40.925
That's your real talent.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.260
You're no good
at song writing
from what I hear.

22:43.262 --> 22:47.531
And we all know
you stink at blackmail.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.133
What do you think
would happen

22:49.135 --> 22:52.770
if you told the world
what you turned me on to, huh?

22:53.339 --> 22:55.239
I'll hire F. Lee Bailey

22:55.541 --> 22:56.240
and the DA won't find

22:56.242 --> 22:59.043
enough credible testimony
to indict me.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.378
But you...

23:00.380 --> 23:03.447
Pimping, parole violation...

23:03.449 --> 23:05.182
You'll go to prison
for the rest of your

23:05.184 --> 23:06.650
miserable stinking life.

23:06.652 --> 23:08.319
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

23:08.321 --> 23:09.954
whoa there, Jack.

23:10.456 --> 23:13.090
I just want to know
how's little Emma.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.226
Me and the girls,
we sure miss her.

23:15.228 --> 23:18.529
Maybe you could talk to that
esteemed partner of yours,

23:18.531 --> 23:22.633
you know, if he's
calmed down a little.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.370
Maybe I could talk to him

23:27.140 --> 23:29.440
or that pretty little
wife of his.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.345
Go ahead, Charlie.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.181
Do your worst.

23:37.283 --> 23:40.618
I want to see you
do your worst.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.259
Get away from the car.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.362
(ENGINE STARTS)

23:51.364 --> 23:53.330

24:23.930 --> 24:27.932
Yeah, Mrs. Karn,
she did her homework.
She's in bed now.

Seems to me
she's pretty happy

24:32.171 --> 24:34.572
Yeah, when I told her
you said no calls,

24:34.574 --> 24:35.239
not a peep.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.575
She didn't give me
no lip about it.

24:37.577 --> 24:40.077
She's being a good girl,

I would have called, but, um,

about the kid?

Yeah, I, uh...
I don't think he's legit.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.821
I mean, why did he
come here to America?

28:10.823 --> 28:13.323
It's a red flag.
I mean, this Hodiak kid,

28:13.325 --> 28:17.594
he could be here to suss out
the movement, for someone.

28:17.697 --> 28:18.629
Inform on us.

28:18.631 --> 28:21.732
I don't think that's
what's happening.

28:22.635 --> 28:25.536
Well, let's just say that you
have interest in the subject

28:25.538 --> 28:29.573
but maybe not as much
knowledge as is possible.

28:33.813 --> 28:37.481
I spoke to a friend.
About Walt.

28:38.350 --> 28:39.583
He's in the movement.

28:39.585 --> 28:41.819
-The what?
-The anti-war movement.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.587
But we were
in country together.

28:43.589 --> 28:47.491
He thinks maybe
he can get you
in touch with your son.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.193
Okay. All right...

28:49.195 --> 28:50.594
But you gotta be cool...

28:50.596 --> 28:51.528
All I care about is Walt.

28:51.530 --> 28:54.832
All right? Nothing else.
You tell your friend that.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.702
I just want to talk
to my son.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.037
Mmm-hmm.

29:01.307 --> 29:04.441
Jefferson Culpepper.
You know him?

29:04.443 --> 29:06.376
Yeah. He's Cass' nephew.
What about him?

29:06.378 --> 29:09.113
Well, Hannah Weinraub
didn't seem senile to me,

29:09.115 --> 29:11.682
so I showed her this.
She mixes up names

29:11.684 --> 29:13.484
but she doesn't hallucinate.

29:13.486 --> 29:14.785

she saw leaving

in the morning.

29:17.656 --> 29:18.822
Says he's a junkie, too.

29:18.824 --> 29:20.824
Culpepper's really strung out.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.626
I didn't figure him
for murder and arson.

29:22.628 --> 29:24.862
What about robbing
the cash box for a fix?

29:24.864 --> 29:27.631
He's got no current address.
You know where he might be?

29:27.633 --> 29:29.466
Well, if he's flush,
he's probably nodding off

shooting galleries
a couple blocks away.

34:42.314 --> 34:43.914
Let go.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.950
Look, I told you Lead Butt
can nail Tolson.

34:46.952 --> 34:48.852
We can nail Tolson,
you said that's the plan,

34:48.854 --> 34:50.053
so what the hell's
the problem?

34:50.055 --> 34:52.823
They don't all close
the way you want 'em to.

34:52.825 --> 34:54.391
What does that mean?

34:55.194 --> 34:56.126
Grow up, huh?

34:56.128 --> 34:58.628
Yeah, so I can be
more like you, right?

34:58.630 --> 35:01.131
No, no, you know?
You're... You're right.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.632
You're gonna be 25 forever.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.334
You're gonna get
everything you want,

35:04.336 --> 35:06.570
and everybody's
gonna love you.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.047
Walt?

35:17.049 --> 35:18.849
Outside there are friends.
They're waiting for me.

35:18.851 --> 35:20.884
Those aren't
your friends, Walt.
They're using you.

35:20.886 --> 35:24.254
-Dad, for once,
can you trust me?
-Okay, okay.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.456
I just... Shh, just sit.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.259
Can you sit?
Can you sit?

35:34.433 --> 35:39.536
Six months ago I was
assigned covert ops
in Cambodia.

35:40.539 --> 35:41.605
In Cambodia? That's...

35:41.607 --> 35:43.540
That's the western border
of Vietnam.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.876
Yeah, we're not supposed
to be fighting there.

35:46.211 --> 35:48.512
That's why I had
Mom bring me home.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.681
Because I can't be a part
of what we're doing there.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.451
What is that?

35:54.453 --> 35:59.055
We're saturation bombing.
We're killing children.

35:59.057 --> 36:02.325
Arming crazies and destroying
a civilization,

36:02.327 --> 36:03.994
that's what we're doing.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.696
It's a war, you know?

36:06.698 --> 36:11.201
If you want to
win a war, you gotta
fight ugly sometimes.

36:11.203 --> 36:14.371
Dad, I have
operational orders.

36:15.140 --> 36:16.106
Photos.

36:16.108 --> 36:18.375
I can prove that
the President is lying

36:18.377 --> 36:19.943
to the American people.

36:20.846 --> 36:25.615
The President...
The President's job is lying.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.785
Okay, well,
it's not my job.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.823
I have to tell the truth.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.394
They'll call me
a traitor, Dad.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.697
And I know that that is
gonna hurt you...

36:42.134 --> 36:43.633
Bad.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.970
I'm sorry.

36:48.273 --> 36:49.806
I'm really sorry.

36:49.808 --> 36:50.473
Wait. What...

36:50.475 --> 36:53.376
-You gotta let me go, Dad.
-What... What are you doing?

36:53.378 --> 36:55.212
What are you gonna do?

36:55.347 --> 36:57.380
I'm gonna give the proof
to the press...

36:57.382 --> 36:59.049
-No.
-...that we are fighting

36:59.051 --> 37:00.016
-an illegal war.
-No. No.

37:00.018 --> 37:01.918
-No, no, no, talk to me...
-Dad, you gotta let me go.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.621
-Talk to me about this.
-Otherwise you won't
see me again!

37:04.623 --> 37:06.623
-Okay?
-Can we just talk about it?

37:06.625 --> 37:08.959
Just talk.
Let's talk it out.

37:08.961 --> 37:11.261
Dad, there's nothing
else to say.

37:11.697 --> 37:14.864
No, Walt. Walt, just come...

37:14.866 --> 37:16.967
Just please...

37:20.572 --> 37:22.038
Let me help you.

37:25.143 --> 37:26.776
You can't.

37:29.448 --> 37:30.814
(DOOR OPENS)

37:31.717 --> 37:33.083
(DOOR CLOSES)

37:34.620 --> 37:35.719
GRACE: Emma, honey.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.854
I brought you
and your friend dinner.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.560
Emma?

37:44.062 --> 37:46.963
I let her in.
Into my home.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.098
-Why didn't you warn me?
-How could I...

37:48.100 --> 37:52.068
And your stupid cop friend
said Emma was being good.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.637
Said she was tame.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.805
Oh, she is your
daughter, all right.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.774
-Everything's a lie.
-Really, Grace?

37:57.776 --> 38:00.176
All me? I'm the only liar
in this house?

38:00.178 --> 38:02.912
You've got some gall
with him sitting here...

38:02.914 --> 38:04.948
-Enough.
-GRACE: You promised me.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.884
You said that you would
keep her safe.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.288
Like every promise
you ever made.

38:11.290 --> 38:13.790
Is there anything
that you don't screw up?

38:13.792 --> 38:16.359
Have you ever done anything
in your life right?

38:16.361 --> 38:17.994
-I will find her.
-No, you won't.

38:17.996 --> 38:21.331
You'll fail.
Like always, you'll fail.

38:24.202 --> 38:28.371
Just get out.
Just get out of my sight.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.108
Welcome to the club.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.638
-(GRUNTS)
-(GIRL SHRIEKS)

39:35.640 --> 39:40.009
All right.
You're not gonna read me
those rights, Miranda?

39:41.213 --> 39:42.379
-No cuffs?
-KATIE: Charlie!

39:42.381 --> 39:44.114
Don't follow. I'll be okay.

39:44.116 --> 39:47.417
Stay up here.
I'm cooperating, man.

39:47.419 --> 39:50.320
They all
saw me cooperating.

(GROANS)

40:49.314 --> 40:51.181
You're killing me.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.918
Stop. Stop.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.286
Stop.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.488
Get in your car and go.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.457
Otherwise you're finished.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.726
As a father, as a cop.
Just go.

41:11.303 --> 41:13.236
SHAFE: That's right, run!

41:21.480 --> 41:22.946

I'm Charlie.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.605
(SOBS) What did
they do to you?

41:48.607 --> 41:49.372
Hey, Charlie.

41:49.374 --> 41:51.674
-(GROANS)
-It's Jimmy Butano.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.610
You're gonna be okay.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.312
Hey, don't try to talk, man.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.414
I'm alive.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.583
'Cause of this guy.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.353
He saved your life.
