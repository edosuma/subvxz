01:05.397 --> 01:07.816
I dreamt I would meet
a brilliant man.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.028
I would steal his breath away..

01:13.281 --> 01:15.865
....and he, in turn,
would steal me away

01:15.867 --> 01:19.788
from everything ugly
into a secret world of our own.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.257
Claire? Oliver?

01:34.260 --> 01:36.719
- Wake up, sleepyhead.
- Put me down.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.428
No, tradition is tradition

01:38.430 --> 01:40.516
and you deserve to be treated
like a princess.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.725
You do realize
we're participating

01:43.727 --> 01:45.353
in a symbolic kidnapping
that stretches

01:45.355 --> 01:47.312
all the way back
to the founding of Rome.

01:47.314 --> 01:49.439
What are you talking about?

01:49.441 --> 01:51.150
In memory of the Sabine women

01:51.152 --> 01:53.947
who were taken in violence
by the Romans.

01:56.615 --> 01:59.243
It all belongs to you now,
my pet.

02:21.098 --> 02:24.185
Claire, Oliver,
this is Elizabeth.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.769
Welcome home, Elizabeth.

02:27.771 --> 02:29.814
Home.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.901
I can't believe
I'm finally here.

02:33.819 --> 02:35.153
Where would you like
supper served?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.157
Upstairs. Thank you, Claire.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.492
Oliver.

02:52.296 --> 02:54.255
Do you like white orchids?

02:54.257 --> 02:55.715
I love them.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.008
How about lilies?

02:58.010 --> 02:59.179
Sure.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.390
You're in luck.

03:33.462 --> 03:35.423
Would you like a cognac?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.215
No, thank you, Claire.

03:38.217 --> 03:40.050
Are you sure?

03:40.052 --> 03:41.137
Yes.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.683
That's all for today,
thank you.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.727
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

03:50.729 --> 03:52.189
Goodnight, Claire.

04:39.737 --> 04:40.736
Wow.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.195
I believe these are all

04:42.197 --> 04:43.782
your favorite pieces.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.125
Could I stay in here a while?

04:54.127 --> 04:57.629
Not now, darling.
There's a lot more to see.

04:59.798 --> 05:02.134
- Hello, Oliver.
- Good morning.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.473
- Good morning, Claire.
- Good morning.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.725
Claire.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.685
This way.

05:45.052 --> 05:47.012
What's in this room?

05:49.223 --> 05:52.974
You're my wife
and I trust you implicitly.

05:52.976 --> 05:56.312
That sounds ominous.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.356
Everything I have shown you

05:58.358 --> 06:02.401
the art, the jewels the clothes,
the money in the safe

06:02.403 --> 06:05.320
all of it is for you.

06:05.322 --> 06:08.826
The only off-limits room
is this one.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.370
Oh.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.541
Do you promise not to go in?

06:16.875 --> 06:19.377
But I can't even get
into the rooms without you.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.838
Of course, you can.

06:22.089 --> 06:24.673
The biometric readers
are programmed

06:24.675 --> 06:27.885
for two thumbprints

06:27.887 --> 06:29.139
yours and mine.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.807
No one else's.

06:33.851 --> 06:36.895
These are our rooms to play in.

06:56.790 --> 07:00.125
I have to leave
first thing in the morning.

07:00.127 --> 07:02.295
Work matters.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.046
On our honeymoon?

07:04.048 --> 07:08.885
It's not ideal, I know,
but it's just for the day.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.719
It will give you time
to familiarize yourself

07:10.721 --> 07:12.264
with the house.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.148
You'll be a good girl,
won't you?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.864
- Have you decided on lunch?
- Uh, um..

08:52.615 --> 08:55.116
No, I'm not hungry.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.201
You should eat.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.661
Okay, um, I don't know.

08:59.663 --> 09:02.248
Perhaps just a light salad
is fine.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.669
- And what would you like in it?
- Um, uh, surprise me.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.381
Uh, okay,
a... avocado and tomato.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.343
- And to drink?
- Just water, thanks.

09:13.345 --> 09:16.556
No, um, could I get a milkshake?

09:18.015 --> 09:20.391
Cho... Chocolate.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.102
What's funny?

09:23.104 --> 09:26.566
Nothing. A chocolate milkshake
is the perfect choice.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.737
Claire.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.699
Is it okay
if I ask you something?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.908
Ask.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.243
Have you worked here
a long time?

09:40.245 --> 09:41.912
Yes.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.250
- For Henry?
- Yes.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.960
He's ridiculously smart,
isn't he? He's, um..

09:48.962 --> 09:52.632
His IQ, his mind
is... is extraordinary.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.718
- Yes.
- Mm.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.430
So why would he pick a girl
like me to marry?

09:59.432 --> 10:00.725
I'm very..

10:02.268 --> 10:03.436
...simple.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.980
I don't know.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.871
Satie founded his own religion.
Did you know that?

17:20.582 --> 17:23.540
He was the official composer
for the Mystical Order

17:23.541 --> 17:27.753
of the Rose and Cross
of the Temple and Grail

17:27.756 --> 17:29.463
founded by the occultist
Joseph Peladan.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.257
But they had a falling out

17:31.259 --> 17:34.052
and Satie founded
his own religion.

17:34.054 --> 17:38.350
L'Eglise Metropolitaine d'Art
de Jesus Conducteur.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.020
Sorry.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.065
You must find this
incredibly boring. Forgive me.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.941
No, no,
it's very interesting.

17:49.943 --> 17:52.569
I can go on and on sometimes.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.697
Come here.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.287
It's your job to shut me up.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.303
I'm like a little boy
around you.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.265
I can't help myself.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.893
How did your work stuff go?

18:24.895 --> 18:26.478
- Fine.
- That's good.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.482
The fire has been duly put out.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.696
- How was your day here?
- Oh, it was fine.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.701
It's so much to take in.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.285
I hadn't thought
about the practicalities

18:41.287 --> 18:43.288
of running such a big home.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.128
Um..

18:50.922 --> 18:52.963
...I tried to make
a phone call yesterday

18:52.965 --> 18:55.382
but the line was dead.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.802
Yes, that happens
all the time here.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.973
- Oh.
- Who were you calling?

19:03.101 --> 19:05.061
- My sister.
- Oh.

19:07.730 --> 19:08.813
What happened?

19:08.815 --> 19:12.816
Oh, I don't know.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.111
You may as well know
that I'm a bit of a clumsy.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.073
- Are you now?
- Yes.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.700
I hope
it doesn't disappoint you.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.828
How could you
ever disappoint me?

19:24.830 --> 19:27.457
Just if you thought I was..

19:27.459 --> 19:29.334
...suave and elegant
all the time.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.632
You're such a good liar,
it's scary.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.011
- What?
- I call your bluff.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.680
Hm, not sure I know I know
what you're talking about.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.767
I think you've always been
suave and elegant.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.562
What do you say
we send the servants away

19:49.564 --> 19:52.025
and spend the rest
of the day in bed?

19:56.738 --> 19:58.823
What about our stroll
on the lake?

20:00.491 --> 20:03.034
We can always stroll tomorrow.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.334
There's a very corruptible
quality about you, Elizabeth.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.719
I didn't hurt you, did I?

20:32.856 --> 20:35.567
The only measure of an action..

20:36.861 --> 20:38.822
...is its consequence.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.894
Elizabeth, my pet.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.815
...you do not deserve this

21:57.817 --> 22:00.111
but you did disobey me.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.198
- Please.
- Please?

22:07.660 --> 22:10.161
I don't know
what you think I saw.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.499
I don't think you saw.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.668
It is what happened

22:16.670 --> 22:17.876
what will happen.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.837
Please.

25:26.151 --> 25:28.111
That's deep enough, Henry.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.364
Henry?

25:46.503 --> 25:47.838
Oliver.

26:05.022 --> 26:08.150
Let me hear you say
it's done, please.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.028
I disagree.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.655
But, but you looked me
in the eye and you said...

26:15.657 --> 26:17.408
I did not!

26:17.410 --> 26:20.705
I want absolute calm.
Can we manage that?

26:23.750 --> 26:26.668
You want to get caught?

26:26.670 --> 26:28.630
It's not an option
I'm really considering.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.422
Only a matter of when. Surely
you're still lucid enough...

26:32.424 --> 26:34.508
The only..

26:34.510 --> 26:36.385
The only way we get caught

26:36.387 --> 26:39.263
is if you insist
on lurking in corridors

26:39.265 --> 26:41.349
staring meaningfully at them.

26:41.351 --> 26:42.560
Hm.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.269
You prick.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.905
Well, that went well.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.035
You haven't touched your food.

27:01.037 --> 27:02.036
Do you think it's possible

27:02.038 --> 27:03.998
substances
have their own velocity?

27:05.125 --> 27:07.290
- For instance?
- Eggs.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.084
Eggs.

27:09.086 --> 27:12.255
Because it changes form,
the egg.

27:12.257 --> 27:15.591
Its whole function
is to become something else.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.134
It keeps disappearing

27:17.136 --> 27:20.179
and reappearing
as something new.

27:20.181 --> 27:21.805
I can't think of anything else
in the world

27:21.807 --> 27:24.933
with that kind
of material altruism.

27:24.935 --> 27:28.145
Material altruism
is moral altruism.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.521
Exactly.

27:29.523 --> 27:32.607
Funny that the egg
should be a symbol for the soul.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.776
Don't you think?

28:08.188 --> 28:10.729
I heard you have a migraine.
So sorry.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.648
Let's not talk about it.
Sit down.

28:12.650 --> 28:13.900
I can come back tomorrow.

28:13.902 --> 28:16.736
No, you're here now.
You want a drink?

28:16.738 --> 28:19.363
Well, what are you having?

28:19.365 --> 28:21.615
Scotch. Hope it knocks it
on the head.

28:21.617 --> 28:24.911
Mm-hmm.
I'll have what you're having.

28:24.913 --> 28:27.537
Stress-related, aren't they,
migraines?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.959
Yes, they can be.

28:30.999 --> 28:33.294
Or tension from exercise

28:33.296 --> 28:36.171
lack of sleep,
hypersensitivity to light.

28:36.173 --> 28:37.547
It could be many things.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.218
I'd suggest fresh air
and walks by the ocean

28:40.220 --> 28:42.053
but, uh, you're the doctor.

28:42.055 --> 28:43.554
You need to be
more than a doctor

28:43.556 --> 28:46.224
to understand a person's mind.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.395
You need to be a saint
or a prophet.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.104
How's your lovely, young wife?

28:52.106 --> 28:54.358
- Young and lovely.
- Is she home?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.193
Yes, she's having a nap.

28:58.195 --> 29:01.073
Young people today
need their beauty sleep.

29:03.034 --> 29:06.244
How glorious
to be young and lovely...

29:06.246 --> 29:09.287
What's on your mind, Frank?

29:09.289 --> 29:11.582
- Nothing.
- You seem worried.

29:11.584 --> 29:12.836
Is everything alright?

29:14.170 --> 29:16.712
Uh, department's
being investigated

29:16.714 --> 29:18.715
for accepting payoffs.

29:18.717 --> 29:22.093
Bureaucrats hunting scalps
for appearance's sake.

29:22.095 --> 29:25.095
I... I've been spared,
but I've got

29:25.097 --> 29:28.932
a couple of colleagues
that are in real hot water.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.396
You have to testify
against your colleagues.

29:33.690 --> 29:36.274
There's no choice.

29:36.276 --> 29:38.817
I'm not looking forward to it.

29:38.819 --> 29:42.154
You can either torture
or be tortured.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.865
There's no third alternative.

29:44.867 --> 29:46.784
In the end,
better to be the torturer.

29:46.786 --> 29:47.953
Don't you think?

29:50.707 --> 29:53.918
Aren't you a barrel
of fucking laughs?

30:11.519 --> 30:13.771
- Yes, Oliver.
- Made you something.

30:15.315 --> 30:18.151
Could you stop making me things?
That would be so kind.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.991
Why do you stay
if you're so unhappy?

30:27.242 --> 30:29.786
I know things you don't.
Let's leave it at that.

30:29.788 --> 30:32.582
Because you love him.
You always have.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.334
I can see
why you would think that.

30:36.336 --> 30:37.709
And don't take this
the wrong way

30:37.711 --> 30:39.336
but you're a child

30:39.338 --> 30:41.546
and you don't know
what you're talking about.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.842
I know this much
and it's more than you seem to.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.969
We're not the prize.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.263
We're the bait.

30:53.103 --> 30:54.520
Thank you, Oliver.

30:56.564 --> 30:58.525
May I be alone now?

32:03.423 --> 32:05.884
I dreamt I would meet
a brilliant man.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.677
I would steal his breath away

32:09.679 --> 32:13.347
and he, in turn, would steal me
away from everything ugly

32:13.349 --> 32:15.684
into a secret world of our own.

32:37.499 --> 32:39.250
Claire? Oliver?

32:43.212 --> 32:45.129
You do realize
we're participating

32:45.131 --> 32:47.632
in a symbolic kidnapping
that stretches all the way back

32:47.634 --> 32:49.676
to the founding of Rome.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.010
Henry, what's in there?

33:33.971 --> 33:36.972
Everything I have shown you
is yours.

33:36.974 --> 33:39.558
All the art,
the jewels, the clothes

33:39.560 --> 33:42.769
the money in the safe,
it's all for you.

33:42.771 --> 33:46.275
The only off-limits room
is this one.

33:47.402 --> 33:49.693
That's all I ask of you.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.363
Can you do that for me?

33:52.365 --> 33:53.488
Yes, of course,
but what's in there...

33:53.490 --> 33:55.741
Let's say, it's the one room
in the house

33:55.743 --> 33:58.370
I can have to myself for work.

34:00.874 --> 34:02.875
You promise not to go in?

34:04.294 --> 34:08.170
I think husbands and wives
should always be truthful.

34:08.172 --> 34:09.672
Wouldn't you agree?

34:11.217 --> 34:13.260
My point precisely.

34:14.846 --> 34:15.927
So if it's that important
to you...

34:15.929 --> 34:17.097
It is.

34:18.724 --> 34:19.726
Promise?

34:21.018 --> 34:22.391
I promise.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.512
I have to leave
first thing in the morning.

34:58.514 --> 35:00.683
- Work matters.
- On our honeymoon?

35:02.226 --> 35:05.186
It's not ideal, I know,
but it's just for the day.

35:05.188 --> 35:07.231
Give you time
to make yourself at home.

35:08.942 --> 35:11.110
You'll be a good girl,
won't you?

36:04.371 --> 36:05.748
I couldn't sleep.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.876
Where's Henry?

36:09.960 --> 36:11.918
In bed.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.795
I forgot how much he snores.

36:16.592 --> 36:18.552
What were you looking at?

36:19.471 --> 36:22.181
I wasn't... looking at anything.

36:23.557 --> 36:25.851
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to..

36:27.519 --> 36:29.521
I'm just so curious,
that's all.

36:30.690 --> 36:31.983
What about?

36:33.693 --> 36:35.860
Everything.

36:35.862 --> 36:37.653
Sometimes it feels like my mind

36:37.655 --> 36:39.908
is just one question
after another.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.536
You, for example.

36:45.038 --> 36:46.164
Me?

36:47.791 --> 36:49.751
Your sense of confidence.

36:51.378 --> 36:53.380
Do you ever get frightened?

36:55.090 --> 36:56.883
- Elizabeth...
- Elizabeth?

36:58.842 --> 37:01.510
In the kitchen, my love.

37:01.512 --> 37:03.056
Elizabeth, listen..

37:08.519 --> 37:11.271
Claire, what are you
doing here?

37:14.733 --> 37:16.360
I forgot something.

37:19.655 --> 37:21.074
Did you find it?

37:23.159 --> 37:24.327
Yes.

37:27.539 --> 37:28.873
Goodnight.

37:56.025 --> 37:57.402
Claire?

38:03.449 --> 38:04.783
Oliver?

43:47.126 --> 43:49.086
Good morning, my love.

43:52.673 --> 43:54.800
Were you having a bad dream?

43:56.135 --> 43:58.387
- What time is it?
- Lunchtime.

44:00.889 --> 44:02.807
Didn't hear you come in.

44:02.809 --> 44:04.811
You must have been very tired.

44:05.978 --> 44:07.980
Did you stay up late?

44:12.693 --> 44:14.193
You left me all alone.

44:14.195 --> 44:16.905
I've given Claire and Oliver
the day off.

44:23.038 --> 44:24.664
Be right back.

44:45.351 --> 44:47.934
- What are you thinking about?
- Uh, what?

44:47.936 --> 44:49.729
I asked what
you're thinking about.

44:49.731 --> 44:51.731
Oh, I don't know.

44:51.733 --> 44:53.858
Nothing.

44:53.860 --> 44:55.820
I knew you'd say that.

44:57.112 --> 44:59.780
Why? What are you thinking?

44:59.782 --> 45:02.200
How everything
is made of patterns.

45:02.202 --> 45:05.702
Once you can predict
the way a person will act

45:05.704 --> 45:07.956
you can learn
how to control them.

45:09.083 --> 45:11.668
Oh, Henry, what are you doing?

45:11.670 --> 45:13.126
A moment of privacy.

45:17.675 --> 45:19.635
We will have privacy..

45:21.721 --> 45:23.681
...before our last rites.

45:24.974 --> 45:26.267
What?

45:27.643 --> 45:32.147
A husband and wife
should always be truthful.

45:35.777 --> 45:37.360
Your words.

45:37.362 --> 45:39.362
But I didn't do anything wrong.

45:39.364 --> 45:41.574
You did disobey me.

46:23.490 --> 46:24.907
Come on.

48:06.094 --> 48:08.052
Easy.

48:08.054 --> 48:09.595
Easy, huh?

48:16.688 --> 48:18.023
It's okay.

52:35.487 --> 52:37.614
- Emergency Services.
- Hello?

52:39.992 --> 52:41.534
I'm stuck.

52:41.536 --> 52:43.869
I'm locked inside a house.
My house.

52:43.871 --> 52:45.496
Are you hurt?

52:45.498 --> 52:48.291
No, I'm not hurt, but I... I
can't work any of the doors.

52:48.293 --> 52:49.833
They're locked on a mechanism

52:49.835 --> 52:52.003
and it... it's not functioning.

52:52.005 --> 52:53.506
One moment, please.

52:56.342 --> 52:58.675
- Are you still there?
- Yes.

52:58.677 --> 53:00.510
So you're locked in?

53:00.512 --> 53:03.014
Yes. Can you, please, help me?

53:03.016 --> 53:04.682
Can I have your name, please?

53:04.684 --> 53:06.391
Elizabeth.

53:06.393 --> 53:08.101
And your surname?

53:08.103 --> 53:09.311
Kellenberg.

53:09.313 --> 53:11.273
What's the...
What's the address?

53:17.780 --> 53:20.784
- I need an address.
- I don't know the address.

53:24.704 --> 53:26.914
I... I have to go.

53:34.630 --> 53:36.090
Good morning.

53:39.844 --> 53:41.137
Good morning.

53:42.722 --> 53:44.179
Where's Henry?

53:44.181 --> 53:46.139
Upstairs.

53:46.141 --> 53:48.102
He's not feeling well.

53:50.855 --> 53:52.231
He's resting.

54:46.494 --> 54:48.036
Emergency Services.

54:48.038 --> 54:51.206
I need a..

54:55.586 --> 54:56.793
You walk out that door

54:56.795 --> 54:58.797
I can't protect you
from the police.

55:03.635 --> 55:05.635
Excuse me?

55:05.637 --> 55:08.098
I need you to understand
you'd be dumb to try.

55:09.641 --> 55:11.684
I know he's dead.

55:11.686 --> 55:12.979
Where's the body?

55:16.148 --> 55:19.193
- Elizabeth.
- He tried to kill me.

55:21.112 --> 55:22.530
I believe you.

55:25.824 --> 55:28.950
- It's upstairs.
- Take me.

55:33.375 --> 55:35.166
I was only protecting myself.

55:35.168 --> 55:36.336
I know.

55:40.340 --> 55:42.215
Henry had many tricks
in his bag.

55:42.217 --> 55:44.842
A brilliant man
with a brilliant mind.

55:44.844 --> 55:46.927
Just as you imagined
in your fairy tale dream.

55:46.929 --> 55:49.805
You would steal his breath away
and he would steal you away...

55:49.807 --> 55:51.516
Away from everything ugly..

55:51.518 --> 55:53.519
- To a secret world of our own.
- To a secret world of our own.

55:54.853 --> 55:56.855
How could you know that?

56:08.492 --> 56:11.494
How much do you remember
of your childhood?

56:11.496 --> 56:14.956
I was sick a lot
in the hospital.

56:14.958 --> 56:16.374
My parents died in a car crash.

56:16.376 --> 56:18.001
I was brought up
in an orphanage.

56:18.003 --> 56:19.961
That's back there where I sleep.

56:19.963 --> 56:21.045
You were there till age 8.

56:21.047 --> 56:22.463
You had a teacher, Mrs. Merger

56:22.465 --> 56:23.965
and a French groundskeeper...

56:23.967 --> 56:25.425
- Chucks.
- Chucks.

56:25.427 --> 56:26.553
Very good.

56:27.971 --> 56:29.931
All of that did happen.

56:31.391 --> 56:35.642
See, it's not an exact science,
biogenesis.

56:35.644 --> 56:37.436
Claire is much better suited
than me to walk you through it.

56:37.438 --> 56:39.354
She was in charge
of your conditioning.

56:39.356 --> 56:40.608
She's quite clever.

56:43.737 --> 56:44.903
Oliver..

56:47.990 --> 56:49.576
...what am I?

56:51.786 --> 56:54.537
You went into the room
he told you not to go into.

56:54.539 --> 56:55.665
Did you not?

56:56.958 --> 56:58.416
I did.

56:58.418 --> 57:00.584
What I saw, I don't understand.

57:00.586 --> 57:03.045
You saw yourself.

57:03.047 --> 57:04.671
Yes.

57:04.673 --> 57:07.302
Which brings us to the only
question worth asking.

57:10.096 --> 57:13.139
You were cooked in that room
like an egg.

57:13.141 --> 57:16.266
Six identical genetic copies.

57:16.268 --> 57:19.646
Elizabeth number five
of the Elizabeth Harvest.

57:20.940 --> 57:22.148
That's what you are.

57:27.655 --> 57:29.280
Car.

57:29.282 --> 57:30.865
What?

57:30.867 --> 57:32.827
Can you see the color?

57:34.411 --> 57:35.952
It's, um..

57:35.954 --> 57:38.289
It's black
with a red light on top.

57:38.291 --> 57:40.208
- Fuck, that was quick.
- Who is it?

57:40.210 --> 57:42.751
Detective Lieutenant Logan,
Henry's only friend.

57:42.753 --> 57:45.545
- A... and what does he want?
- He wants to talk to you again.

57:45.547 --> 57:47.130
What do you mean again?

57:47.132 --> 57:48.675
Henry explained away
you sleeping all the time

57:48.677 --> 57:50.217
as chronic fatigue syndrome.

57:50.219 --> 57:51.969
It's gonna help you today.

57:51.971 --> 57:53.637
Make light of the fact
Henry is the one napping

57:53.639 --> 57:55.599
but get him to leave quickly.

57:57.184 --> 58:00.269
- Good morning, Oliver.
- Good morning, detective.

58:00.271 --> 58:03.021
- Your father around?
- Upstairs, taking a nap.

58:03.023 --> 58:05.650
Yeah, well, since
when does he take naps?

58:05.652 --> 58:08.070
I know, but it happens.
Ask Elizabeth.

58:13.034 --> 58:15.659
Oh. Hello again.

58:15.661 --> 58:18.287
Mrs. Kellenberg,
it's truly a surprise.

58:18.289 --> 58:20.831
Because usually
I'm the one napping, right?

58:20.833 --> 58:22.749
Henry isn't feeling well.

58:22.751 --> 58:25.545
I was beginning to think he kept
you locked up in a tower.

58:26.880 --> 58:28.755
Is there something you want?

58:28.757 --> 58:31.468
- You know, to drink?
- Uh, what are you having?

58:32.887 --> 58:36.472
Oliver, would you mind
getting us something?

58:36.474 --> 58:39.019
- Water's fine.
- Water's just fine.

58:49.570 --> 58:52.905
- Are you in trouble?
- What?

58:52.907 --> 58:55.702
Did you call Emergency Services?

58:56.952 --> 58:58.163
When?

58:59.581 --> 59:02.956
I got a message that
a Mrs. Kellenberg called in

59:02.958 --> 59:05.208
so I came to check it out.

59:05.210 --> 59:07.045
Word sure travels fast.

59:07.047 --> 59:09.380
Word? Of what?

59:09.382 --> 59:11.382
Claire
getting rushed to hospital.

59:11.384 --> 59:13.050
Isn't that why you're here?

59:13.052 --> 59:15.052
What's wrong with Claire?

59:15.054 --> 59:17.431
She had a heart condition,
congenital.

59:18.724 --> 59:20.057
She's the one
who called emergency

59:20.059 --> 59:23.103
and the operator
must have gotten confused.

59:26.565 --> 59:27.942
Excuse me.

59:33.114 --> 59:34.407
You didn't call?

59:35.367 --> 59:37.575
No, I didn't.

59:37.577 --> 59:39.786
It was Claire.

59:39.788 --> 59:41.829
She did.

59:41.831 --> 59:43.083
Ah.

59:47.920 --> 59:50.505
Let me see
if I got this straight.

59:50.507 --> 59:52.882
Your husband's not feeling well

59:52.884 --> 59:54.217
Claire has a weak heart

59:54.219 --> 59:56.427
you have
chronic fatigue syndrome

59:56.429 --> 59:58.597
and Oliver, of course, is blind.

01:00:00.599 --> 01:00:02.474
Now I don't mean
to be insensitive

01:00:02.476 --> 01:00:04.936
but it's beginning to feel
like a hospital around here.

01:00:08.608 --> 01:00:10.441
- Oh, my God!
- Did I get him?

01:00:10.443 --> 01:00:11.693
- Oh, my God!
- Did I get him?

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:13.610
Yes.

01:00:13.612 --> 01:00:14.695
Nobody you need
to feel bad about.

01:00:14.697 --> 01:00:15.947
Why... Why did you do that?

01:00:15.949 --> 01:00:17.782
This bastard
was on Henry's payroll.

01:00:17.784 --> 01:00:20.325
Caught one of you three years ago making a
run for it and brought you right back here.

01:00:20.327 --> 01:00:21.952
What do you think
Henry did with her?

01:00:21.954 --> 01:00:23.454
He killed her?

01:00:23.456 --> 01:00:25.333
See? You're clever.

01:00:27.501 --> 01:00:29.459
He killed all of you.

01:00:29.461 --> 01:00:31.878
It's what he lived for.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.880
Henry was your father.

01:00:33.882 --> 01:00:35.800
Not anymore.

01:00:35.802 --> 01:00:38.469
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:00:42.474 --> 01:00:44.184
It's okay. It's okay.

01:00:45.353 --> 01:00:46.519
That was scary.

01:00:53.235 --> 01:00:55.820
What do you remember
after age 8?

01:00:55.822 --> 01:00:58.280
There's a gap, isn't there?

01:00:58.282 --> 01:00:59.740
He put you back in the tank.

01:00:59.742 --> 01:01:01.992
He'd bring you out at different
times for physical therapy.

01:01:01.994 --> 01:01:04.579
He'd fill your mind
with memories and events

01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:07.164
music trying to customize
your personality

01:01:07.166 --> 01:01:08.458
trying to make you whole,
but you never

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.708
actually experienced
any of that...

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:12.170
Stop!

01:01:12.172 --> 01:01:14.171
Please, I want to wake up now!

01:01:14.173 --> 01:01:15.340
Please, make it stop.

01:01:15.342 --> 01:01:17.633
I want things to go back
to normal!

01:01:17.635 --> 01:01:18.675
Alright.

01:01:18.677 --> 01:01:21.845
I want to go back
to my honeymoon.

01:01:21.847 --> 01:01:23.224
Alright.

01:01:24.976 --> 01:01:26.936
Help me with him.

01:01:43.577 --> 01:01:45.327
I think you should get
as far away from here

01:01:45.329 --> 01:01:47.871
as possible, Elizabeth.

01:01:47.873 --> 01:01:49.833
Go and pack a bag.

01:01:51.043 --> 01:01:53.504
- You're staying?
- I have to.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:58.048
Make sure to take some money
from the safe.

01:01:58.050 --> 01:01:59.508
You'll need it.

01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:01.887
Um, how much?

01:02:03.972 --> 01:02:05.391
Like that.

01:02:09.228 --> 01:02:10.730
Okay.

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.711
Elizabeth?

01:02:34.713 --> 01:02:37.255
I'm in here.

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:39.882
Before you go, I wonder if you
could do something for me.

01:02:39.884 --> 01:02:40.967
What is it?

01:02:40.969 --> 01:02:42.927
This journal.

01:02:42.929 --> 01:02:46.639
I can't read it and I need
some information in it.

01:02:46.641 --> 01:02:48.684
- It's Henry's?
- Claire's.

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.941
Hey, what are you doing?

01:02:56.943 --> 01:02:58.608
Oliver?

01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:01.070
Oliver, did you just
lock me in? Oliver?

01:03:01.072 --> 01:03:03.947
Oliver, let me out!

01:03:03.949 --> 01:03:06.284
Oliver! No! Let me out!

01:03:06.286 --> 01:03:07.784
Oliver!

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:55.708
Everyone
in the scientific community

01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:57.793
knew about
Dr. Henry Kellenberg's

01:03:57.795 --> 01:04:00.671
breakthroughs
in somatic cell research.

01:04:00.673 --> 01:04:03.257
But after pioneering
and patenting the process

01:04:03.259 --> 01:04:05.927
by which microRNA cells
were reprogrammed

01:04:05.929 --> 01:04:08.637
into the TERX2 encoding

01:04:08.639 --> 01:04:11.057
he retired a billionaire.

01:04:11.059 --> 01:04:13.309
Years later, out of the blue

01:04:13.311 --> 01:04:15.728
he invited me to come see him.

01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:18.648
This was the pivotal moment
of my professional life.

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:20.023
Dr. Claire Stratton.

01:04:20.025 --> 01:04:22.901
Dr. Kellenberg,
this is an honor.

01:04:22.903 --> 01:04:23.985
Oh.

01:04:23.987 --> 01:04:25.445
You worked at Baxter?

01:04:25.447 --> 01:04:28.117
Yes, yes,
un... until quite recently.

01:04:30.327 --> 01:04:33.454
- You were fired?
- It's complicated.

01:04:33.456 --> 01:04:35.123
What I heard was you refused

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.499
to share your research
with the military.

01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:39.836
If my information is incorrect,
I apologize.

01:04:39.838 --> 01:04:42.088
Uh, no,
you're clearly well informed.

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:45.048
I am intrigued by your work
in neurodegeneration.

01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:48.720
Your views on Progeria go
against practically everyone's.

01:04:48.722 --> 01:04:50.929
That's why you're here.

01:04:50.931 --> 01:04:54.684
'Cause my findings were refuted
by the entire medical community.

01:04:54.686 --> 01:04:56.646
Can I offer you
some refreshment?

01:04:59.606 --> 01:05:02.233
When I was younger,
I had so much drive

01:05:02.235 --> 01:05:04.526
and inexhaustible energy.

01:05:04.528 --> 01:05:06.445
I was obsessed with the idea

01:05:06.447 --> 01:05:07.988
of being useful
to future generations.

01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:11.534
Now I know history
will remember me unkindly.

01:05:11.536 --> 01:05:13.661
I think we both
know you're being modest.

01:05:13.663 --> 01:05:15.829
Well, history will remember me
as a monster

01:05:15.831 --> 01:05:18.958
and that is where you come in.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.420
A healthy mind to bear witness.

01:05:22.422 --> 01:05:25.050
- Oliver?
- I finished my homework, dad.

01:05:27.594 --> 01:05:29.346
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:05:30.764 --> 01:05:33.932
Oliver, this is Claire,
a brilliant researcher.

01:05:35.684 --> 01:05:37.644
She'll be staying with us.

01:05:39.688 --> 01:05:41.606
So lovely to meet you, Oliver.

01:05:41.608 --> 01:05:44.525
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, Claire.

01:05:44.527 --> 01:05:47.197
You have a way
of making assumptions, doctor.

01:05:50.115 --> 01:05:51.159
Hm.

01:06:01.043 --> 01:06:03.797
A healthy mind to bear witness,
he called it.

01:06:07.132 --> 01:06:08.550
But at what cost?

01:06:10.804 --> 01:06:12.845
I am a trained scientist.

01:06:12.847 --> 01:06:14.389
I respect process.

01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:17.891
I believe in research,
testing, analysis.

01:06:17.893 --> 01:06:21.646
And yet here I was in the
middle of a tragic love story

01:06:21.648 --> 01:06:25.316
inexplicable, inconvenient
and impossible.

01:06:25.318 --> 01:06:27.818
Fr... From... From an ethical
and moral standpoint...

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:29.653
Yes, I... I will be crucified.

01:06:29.655 --> 01:06:32.615
- Yes.
- Yes, but I cannot undo it.

01:06:32.617 --> 01:06:34.992
I know why I did
what I did, Claire.

01:06:34.994 --> 01:06:36.744
The question is

01:06:36.746 --> 01:06:40.498
given human subjects
and unlimited means

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.460
can you crack the code?

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.715
Perhaps.

01:06:51.719 --> 01:06:53.094
Kellenberg's wife had died

01:06:53.096 --> 01:06:56.014
shortly after giving birth
to a son, Oliver

01:06:56.016 --> 01:06:58.641
of a very rare strain
of Werner Syndrome

01:06:58.643 --> 01:07:01.853
in which her mutated WRN
suddenly degenerated

01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:03.398
at a dizzying rate.

01:07:04.983 --> 01:07:06.898
Sick with grief,
he cloned her cells

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.861
and harvested six copies.

01:07:10.237 --> 01:07:12.656
Complications began
almost immediately.

01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:18.038
At birth, two of the subjects
already displayed the mutation.

01:07:20.206 --> 01:07:21.789
In order to buy himself time

01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:24.708
Kellenberg did something
even more radical.

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:28.211
He customized hyperbaric
chambers into cryogenic tanks

01:07:28.213 --> 01:07:30.380
and he put the bodies
in suspended animation

01:07:30.382 --> 01:07:32.592
while he searched for a cure.

01:07:32.594 --> 01:07:34.760
Good morning, Elizabeth.

01:07:34.762 --> 01:07:36.679
By the time
I joined the project

01:07:36.681 --> 01:07:39.059
only four subjects
remained alive.

01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:41.853
Good morning, Elizabeth.

01:07:44.396 --> 01:07:47.232
Two years later, I cracked it.

01:07:51.237 --> 01:07:53.070
Henry?

01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:48.542
Every night,
Henry recorded messages

01:08:48.545 --> 01:08:51.086
and played music
for the subjects

01:08:51.087 --> 01:08:53.296
convinced the ideas
absorbed into their minds

01:08:53.298 --> 01:08:54.965
would develop as memories.

01:08:54.966 --> 01:08:56.469
I was dubious.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.971
What do you remember
after age eight?

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:15.694
Subject emerged biologically
and physiologically healthy

01:09:15.697 --> 01:09:18.031
but disoriented and in pain.

01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:21.616
She seemed to remember nothing
for more than a few seconds.

01:09:21.618 --> 01:09:24.327
Yes, I was happy three times.

01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:27.497
When Mrs. Merger let me play
in the garden, is one

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.125
and then when I had a

01:09:29.127 --> 01:09:32.461
um, I had
a... a chocolate milkshake.

01:09:32.462 --> 01:09:35.505
That was good.
And then also..

01:09:35.506 --> 01:09:38.175
Abysses of amnesia
continually opened beneath her

01:09:38.176 --> 01:09:41.470
and unable to maintain
a genuine inner world

01:09:41.471 --> 01:09:43.305
she would bridge them
with scrambled fictions.

01:09:43.307 --> 01:09:45.892
What's this?

01:09:45.894 --> 01:09:48.145
I can't run at all today,
I don't think.

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:53.359
Are you a soldier?

01:09:54.694 --> 01:09:57.195
No, Elizabeth, it's me, Henry.

01:09:57.197 --> 01:09:58.905
Henry!

01:09:58.907 --> 01:10:00.867
When did you fly in?

01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:05.160
Henry was convinced
she would acclimate

01:10:05.162 --> 01:10:07.955
and her repertoire of memories
would match up.

01:10:07.957 --> 01:10:09.624
But the constant strain
on her mind

01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:11.711
became too much
for her body to bear.

01:10:20.095 --> 01:10:23.553
Days later,
somehow under Henry's watch

01:10:23.555 --> 01:10:25.555
she discovered
the harvest room.

01:11:07.559 --> 01:11:09.599
What... What did my niece say?

01:11:09.601 --> 01:11:12.102
- She's your niece?
- My sister's child.

01:11:12.104 --> 01:11:14.731
She's had a long,
troubled history.

01:11:14.733 --> 01:11:17.607
I'd hoped the move from the city
would help her, but..

01:11:17.609 --> 01:11:21.236
She made some
pretty bizarre accusations.

01:11:21.238 --> 01:11:22.738
She's a danger to herself.

01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:25.575
Yeah, she has a habit
of inventing stories.

01:11:25.577 --> 01:11:28.076
She's a bit of a fantasist,
I'm afraid.

01:11:28.078 --> 01:11:31.121
At times, her behavior
can be utterly illogical.

01:11:31.123 --> 01:11:33.290
Are you her legal guardian?

01:11:33.292 --> 01:11:36.294
I... I'm the only family
she has left.

01:11:36.296 --> 01:11:39.421
Well then, I am fine
to release her to you

01:11:39.423 --> 01:11:43.386
but I'm afraid
I have to file a report.

01:11:44.762 --> 01:11:46.096
Elizabeth?

01:11:49.516 --> 01:11:52.143
Look, I realize you're upset,
but I had to run some errands

01:11:52.145 --> 01:11:54.353
and I needed you to stay.

01:11:54.355 --> 01:11:55.898
I apologize.

01:11:58.943 --> 01:12:00.902
I phoned the hospital.

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:03.196
They're keeping Claire
for observation

01:12:03.198 --> 01:12:04.571
run tests for a couple of days.

01:12:04.573 --> 01:12:06.533
But she will recover.

01:12:09.621 --> 01:12:11.581
Are you reading the journal?

01:12:15.085 --> 01:12:17.127
I know you can hear me.

01:12:18.003 --> 01:12:20.006
I've brought you some supper.

01:12:21.298 --> 01:12:23.424
I'm going to open the door now.

01:12:23.426 --> 01:12:24.842
Please don't do anything crazy.

01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:34.559
- Let me go!
- Please, stop!

01:12:34.561 --> 01:12:36.812
Please!

01:12:36.814 --> 01:12:38.356
- The code!
- What?

01:12:38.358 --> 01:12:39.816
The front door code,
what is it?

01:12:39.818 --> 01:12:42.192
- I'll open it for you.
- Tell me the code!

01:12:42.194 --> 01:12:43.236
It's your birthdate. The code!

01:12:43.238 --> 01:12:44.696
What's my birthdate?

01:12:44.698 --> 01:12:47.365
0-9-16.

01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:50.535
- Are you lying to me?
- I'm not.

01:12:50.537 --> 01:12:52.995
Elizabeth, I'm on your side.
I always have been.

01:12:52.997 --> 01:12:54.955
I knew it was wrong
to lock you up, but I just

01:12:54.957 --> 01:12:56.790
I wanted to talk to you
and I couldn't foresee

01:12:56.792 --> 01:12:58.084
any other way
you wouldn't flee this place.

01:12:58.086 --> 01:12:59.876
Yeah, well,
you're right about that.

01:12:59.878 --> 01:13:01.381
What are you doing?

01:13:02.881 --> 01:13:04.842
You don't have to do this.

01:13:07.386 --> 01:13:11.013
- If you're lying to me..
- I already told you.

01:13:11.015 --> 01:13:12.975
I just want you
to get to know me.

01:14:29.636 --> 01:14:32.681
I sincerely apologize
for the childish trick.

01:14:34.682 --> 01:14:37.351
But I do need to finish
our conversation.

01:14:40.188 --> 01:14:43.483
- What are you doing to her?
- Keeping her alive.

01:14:45.068 --> 01:14:47.442
Same as I did for you.

01:14:47.444 --> 01:14:51.280
I can't express how odd it is
to feel so close to someone

01:14:51.282 --> 01:14:53.782
who doesn't know you exist

01:14:53.784 --> 01:14:55.577
and then to finally meet.

01:14:56.912 --> 01:14:58.830
At the end of the day,
the world is a conflict

01:14:58.832 --> 01:15:01.501
between positive
and negative charges.

01:15:02.711 --> 01:15:04.419
I so had hoped
once we were free of him

01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:07.338
we could be candid
with one another.

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:09.339
Why won't you let me go?

01:15:09.341 --> 01:15:12.384
The last thing I want to do is
keep you here against your will.

01:15:12.386 --> 01:15:15.178
I just require you to have
a little bit more patience.

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:17.850
Here, take the head
while I turn her over.

01:15:19.685 --> 01:15:21.645
Claire usually does this bit.

01:15:23.939 --> 01:15:25.940
When can I go?

01:15:25.942 --> 01:15:29.652
I've waited so long to have
these conversations with you.

01:15:29.654 --> 01:15:32.571
Just tell me when I can go.

01:15:32.573 --> 01:15:34.826
Once you tell me
how much Claire knew.

01:15:35.868 --> 01:15:37.828
Please, give me a hand.

01:15:40.039 --> 01:15:41.121
If you really wish to harm me

01:15:41.123 --> 01:15:43.374
I can't possibly hide
from you, can I?

01:15:43.376 --> 01:15:45.545
You have the advantage now.

01:16:00.894 --> 01:16:02.395
So curious.

01:17:13.298 --> 01:17:14.801
Wake up, Elizabeth.

01:17:17.136 --> 01:17:19.596
Darling, wake up.

01:17:21.224 --> 01:17:22.641
Elizabeth?

01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:04.348
Are you her legal guardian?

01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:07.226
I... I'm the only family
she has left.

01:18:07.228 --> 01:18:10.604
Well then, I am fine
to release her to you

01:18:10.606 --> 01:18:15.526
but I'm afraid
I have to file a report.

01:18:15.528 --> 01:18:17.695
I apologize.

01:18:17.697 --> 01:18:19.405
Is that absolutely necessary...

01:18:19.407 --> 01:18:22.866
Claire, let me speak
with the detective.

01:18:22.868 --> 01:18:24.828
You've been through enough.

01:18:27.039 --> 01:18:28.416
Thank you.

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:32.125
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:18:32.127 --> 01:18:34.003
With Detective Logan silenced

01:18:34.005 --> 01:18:36.546
we proceeded with our tests.

01:18:36.548 --> 01:18:39.884
One week later, she was dead.

01:18:39.886 --> 01:18:42.222
Henry, what happened?

01:18:46.225 --> 01:18:48.478
I found her face-down
on the pillows.

01:18:49.895 --> 01:18:51.898
She must have suffocated.

01:18:52.899 --> 01:18:55.235
- How?
- I don't know.

01:18:58.404 --> 01:19:02.533
We need to run more tests.

01:19:04.077 --> 01:19:06.579
Find out
why her body shut down.

01:19:09.582 --> 01:19:12.002
The questions I had,
I never asked.

01:19:14.337 --> 01:19:17.421
Partly because
I didn't want to believe it.

01:19:17.423 --> 01:19:20.299
Partly because
when we analyzed her cells

01:19:20.301 --> 01:19:23.385
we discovered the
neurodegeneration had returned.

01:19:23.387 --> 01:19:24.555
I had failed.

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:28.808
The data-flow resulting from the
large sequencing throughout..

01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:30.476
All four mutations altered

01:19:30.478 --> 01:19:32.394
only the C-terminal portion
of the genes..

01:19:32.396 --> 01:19:35.522
...in nuclear shape due to
the mutated gene resulting in..

01:19:35.524 --> 01:19:37.275
...makes the nucleus unstable..

01:19:37.277 --> 01:19:39.110
...cellular instability
appears..

01:19:39.112 --> 01:19:41.571
Interestingly,
after the splicing correction

01:19:41.573 --> 01:19:43.572
the HGPS cells show..

01:19:43.574 --> 01:19:45.366
...process and causes
damage itself..

01:19:45.368 --> 01:19:47.617
...ten hours every day
for the next six months

01:19:47.619 --> 01:19:50.955
until we had exhausted
every combination.

01:20:12.103 --> 01:20:14.853
When the inevitable happened

01:20:14.855 --> 01:20:17.647
I was ready for it.

01:20:17.649 --> 01:20:19.152
I initiated it.

01:20:32.539 --> 01:20:35.335
I think we should turn off
the machines, Claire.

01:20:38.171 --> 01:20:40.671
We can't do that.

01:20:40.673 --> 01:20:42.007
It's not working.

01:20:46.179 --> 01:20:50.557
I've wasted so many years
of my life like a fool.

01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:53.768
I was still a lunatic.

01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:55.897
Or a husband in love.

01:20:58.233 --> 01:21:00.652
You have no right
to be this good to me.

01:21:02.153 --> 01:21:04.197
Finally, we agree on something.

01:21:06.573 --> 01:21:07.783
Come here.

01:21:44.529 --> 01:21:46.072
Let's try this again.

01:21:48.323 --> 01:21:49.742
Quid pro quo.

01:21:50.909 --> 01:21:53.535
Do you know what that means?

01:21:53.537 --> 01:21:55.580
I don't think you do.
It's Latin.

01:21:55.582 --> 01:21:57.542
Is it Latin for fuck off?

01:21:58.752 --> 01:22:00.587
Means an equal exchange.

01:22:01.921 --> 01:22:05.005
I give you something..

01:22:05.007 --> 01:22:06.967
...and you give me something
in return.

01:22:09.386 --> 01:22:11.678
I want to know
what she says about me

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:14.098
in exchange for which
I'll tell you about yourself.

01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:15.641
What if I don't want to know?

01:22:15.643 --> 01:22:17.602
Oh, it's built into your DNA
to want to know.

01:22:17.604 --> 01:22:18.980
It's your nature.

01:22:21.190 --> 01:22:22.690
What does she say?

01:22:22.692 --> 01:22:24.735
Doesn't say anything about you.

01:22:26.945 --> 01:22:29.112
What does she write about?

01:22:29.114 --> 01:22:31.074
She initiated an affair
with Henry

01:22:31.076 --> 01:22:33.951
after the death
of the third subject.

01:22:33.953 --> 01:22:36.661
After he choked her.

01:22:36.663 --> 01:22:38.289
She had her doubts,
but she didn't ask

01:22:38.291 --> 01:22:39.874
because she failed
at figuring the code.

01:22:39.876 --> 01:22:42.168
She didn't fail.
He corrupted the samples.

01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:44.631
- How would you know?
- Because I know him.

01:22:47.132 --> 01:22:49.094
So she figures it out.

01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:53.470
You want to know
if you're cured?

01:22:53.472 --> 01:22:55.140
Quid pro quo.

01:22:57.185 --> 01:22:59.102
Yes.

01:22:59.104 --> 01:23:00.937
She reversed
the neurodegeneration.

01:23:00.939 --> 01:23:02.649
You're all clear.

01:23:05.443 --> 01:23:07.485
You all lived here
until you were eight

01:23:07.487 --> 01:23:09.653
hidden from the world,
never allowed out.

01:23:09.655 --> 01:23:11.155
I was sent to boarding school.

01:23:11.157 --> 01:23:12.990
Came back the summer
I turned 12

01:23:12.992 --> 01:23:14.534
and there was just
one of you here

01:23:14.536 --> 01:23:16.660
the second Elizabeth.

01:23:16.662 --> 01:23:18.161
The first, he killed.

01:23:18.163 --> 01:23:20.540
You and the others
were in your tanks.

01:23:20.542 --> 01:23:21.665
I didn't know this at the time,
of course.

01:23:21.667 --> 01:23:23.334
I pieced it all together later.

01:23:23.336 --> 01:23:27.379
Like you, I wasn't allowed
in the forbidden room.

01:23:27.381 --> 01:23:31.299
That summer,
you were the prettiest

01:23:31.301 --> 01:23:35.470
strangest creature I ever saw.

01:23:35.472 --> 01:23:38.433
And how would you know
if you're blind?

01:23:38.435 --> 01:23:40.353
I wasn't then.

01:23:48.653 --> 01:23:51.028
I told you all my secrets

01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:53.447
and you told me
about your nightmares.

01:23:53.449 --> 01:23:54.991
And he couldn't stand it

01:23:54.993 --> 01:23:57.035
us being together,
being children.

01:23:57.037 --> 01:23:58.952
And one night,
I spied on the two of you

01:23:58.954 --> 01:24:01.832
and you were standing
perfectly still..

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:06.501
...like a little doll,
holding up your skirt

01:24:06.503 --> 01:24:09.880
and asking him what he was
doing at every step

01:24:09.882 --> 01:24:14.802
and him kissing you everywhere.

01:24:14.804 --> 01:24:17.679
I couldn't stand it
so I confronted him.

01:24:17.681 --> 01:24:20.223
That night,
Henry attacked me in my sleep

01:24:20.225 --> 01:24:22.809
and later, he claimed
it was an electrical fire

01:24:22.811 --> 01:24:25.021
that made me blind.

01:24:25.023 --> 01:24:27.522
I hated him touching you

01:24:27.524 --> 01:24:30.401
but you didn't mind at all.

01:24:30.403 --> 01:24:31.988
That wasn't me.

01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:36.493
Oliver, that wasn't me.

01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:08.940
Just as I had initiated it

01:25:08.942 --> 01:25:10.900
I brought the affair to an end.

01:25:10.902 --> 01:25:12.943
Not that it ever had a chance
of being anything

01:25:12.945 --> 01:25:16.113
more than colleagues
letting off steam.

01:25:16.115 --> 01:25:18.199
Not that it could
ever compete with..

01:25:18.201 --> 01:25:20.412
It's Elizabeth's birthday today.

01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:24.582
Yes, I remember.

01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:31.129
May I ask you something?

01:25:31.131 --> 01:25:32.504
Ask.

01:25:32.506 --> 01:25:33.798
Have you ever been in love?

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.634
Intense, passionate love?

01:25:36.636 --> 01:25:38.510
The kind where you swear
to protect that person

01:25:38.512 --> 01:25:40.138
and care for them
your whole life?

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:42.348
Till death do you part.

01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:44.392
Isn't that
the fine print though?

01:25:44.394 --> 01:25:46.643
When you exchange marriage vows

01:25:46.645 --> 01:25:48.812
you sign up for the long haul.

01:25:48.814 --> 01:25:51.648
Conflict, and pain, and guilt

01:25:51.650 --> 01:25:54.235
and longing, in sickness
and in health, et cetera.

01:25:54.237 --> 01:25:55.695
Not for an accident

01:25:55.697 --> 01:25:57.821
that decimates your beloved
two years later.

01:25:57.823 --> 01:26:00.532
That is not the deal
you made with fate.

01:26:00.534 --> 01:26:03.119
We are, each of us

01:26:03.121 --> 01:26:05.081
an eventual tragedy.

01:26:15.007 --> 01:26:17.508
What is it you want, Henry?

01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:20.010
- Really want?
- I'm afraid of what I want.

01:26:20.012 --> 01:26:22.181
That's never stopped you before.

01:26:26.728 --> 01:26:30.187
I want to relive
my wedding night.

01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:32.898
You want to fuck young, adoring
flesh that never grows old.

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:36.861
Now don't be crass, Claire.
It's not that.

01:26:36.863 --> 01:26:41.201
I want to experience
that euphoria again.

01:26:42.243 --> 01:26:43.701
I wish you had known her.

01:26:43.703 --> 01:26:45.786
She was the real thing,
a force...

01:26:45.788 --> 01:26:47.871
Of joy.

01:26:47.873 --> 01:26:51.918
You've told me
a few hundred times.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.838
You understand
it has nothing to do with us.

01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:58.715
You don't believe me

01:26:58.717 --> 01:27:01.885
but I meant it
when I said there is no us.

01:27:01.887 --> 01:27:04.680
I have to experience it again

01:27:04.682 --> 01:27:08.684
and if you have
any reservations, Claire...

01:27:08.686 --> 01:27:11.439
If feeling sick to my stomach
is a reservation.

01:27:13.274 --> 01:27:14.898
Fine.

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:16.903
I can see it through on my own.

01:27:18.029 --> 01:27:20.699
Perhaps you should leave.

01:27:32.167 --> 01:27:34.753
We are defined
by the choices we make.

01:27:38.925 --> 01:27:40.592
Why didn't I go?

01:27:53.273 --> 01:27:55.734
Can't find any record
of Elizabeth giving birth.

01:27:57.819 --> 01:27:59.777
Professor Oliver Eccleston
was the name

01:27:59.779 --> 01:28:02.530
of your very first mentor
at Fielding.

01:28:02.532 --> 01:28:05.618
It's a bit sentimental,
but that's you all over.

01:28:07.203 --> 01:28:08.577
I want us to grow old together

01:28:08.579 --> 01:28:11.621
but I thought
what if she doesn't want

01:28:11.623 --> 01:28:15.209
this decaying old body.

01:28:15.211 --> 01:28:18.173
What if she yearns
for what she fell in love with?

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:21.634
A younger me.

01:28:23.094 --> 01:28:25.055
He's not your son, is he?

01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:28.430
Oliver is you.

01:28:28.432 --> 01:28:30.393
But he doesn't know it.

01:28:36.065 --> 01:28:37.608
Oh, my God.

01:29:10.891 --> 01:29:11.933
Wake up.

01:29:14.354 --> 01:29:17.062
- What are you doing?
- Tell me.

01:29:17.064 --> 01:29:19.357
Tell you what?

01:29:19.359 --> 01:29:21.361
You know what I need to know.

01:29:23.113 --> 01:29:24.986
Where have you been
the last two days?

01:29:24.988 --> 01:29:27.656
- Busy.
- What happened to your hand?

01:29:27.658 --> 01:29:30.076
- Nothing.
- Well, it's bleeding.

01:29:30.078 --> 01:29:33.537
- I bumped into something.
- Oh, you're bleeding a lot.

01:29:33.539 --> 01:29:35.999
It was sharp. Quit stalling.

01:29:36.001 --> 01:29:37.961
What does she write about me?

01:29:39.378 --> 01:29:41.381
She thinks you're Henry.

01:29:43.382 --> 01:29:45.883
- But you're not.
- You're lying.

01:29:45.885 --> 01:29:47.843
I can hear it in your voice.

01:29:47.845 --> 01:29:49.512
Henry showed her
the birth certificate

01:29:49.514 --> 01:29:52.055
had her call the doctor.

01:29:52.057 --> 01:29:53.724
You are not his clone,
you're his son

01:29:53.726 --> 01:29:55.559
so you can hate his guts
if you want

01:29:55.561 --> 01:29:57.352
but you're not him.

01:29:57.354 --> 01:29:59.857
You can be whoever you want.

01:30:13.662 --> 01:30:15.748
I hated him so much.

01:30:17.583 --> 01:30:19.168
We both did.

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.295
But now he's gone

01:30:23.297 --> 01:30:25.759
and we are defined
by the choices we make.

01:30:28.427 --> 01:30:30.430
You love me, don't you?

01:30:31.972 --> 01:30:34.975
- I always have.
- So why don't you show me?

01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:38.227
Boy, you learn fast.

01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:40.562
You saw him touching me.

01:30:40.564 --> 01:30:42.773
It made you very jealous.

01:30:42.775 --> 01:30:44.402
Now he's gone.

01:30:46.029 --> 01:30:47.989
And you can touch me.

01:30:58.457 --> 01:31:01.126
We've both been held captive
by a monster.

01:31:03.462 --> 01:31:05.465
We deserve something good.

01:31:07.926 --> 01:31:09.424
I'm right here

01:31:09.426 --> 01:31:11.679
but you have to come closer.

01:31:12.971 --> 01:31:15.639
- So you could attack me?
- No.

01:31:15.641 --> 01:31:18.183
So you can use those shears
and cut off my underwear

01:31:18.185 --> 01:31:20.145
and make me yours.

01:31:24.192 --> 01:31:27.319
Don't be scared. I won't bite.

01:31:31.615 --> 01:31:33.158
Closer.

01:31:42.836 --> 01:31:44.838
I can feel your heartbeat.

01:31:46.672 --> 01:31:48.757
It's beating so fast.

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.887
Show me you love me.

01:31:58.184 --> 01:32:00.518
Drop the shears!

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.978
The code! The real door code!

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:05.022
- 3-3-1-4-7-4.
- Again!

01:32:05.024 --> 01:32:06.732
3-3-1-4-7-4.

01:32:06.734 --> 01:32:08.694
Now the key to this thing!

01:32:15.326 --> 01:32:16.909
I should kill you.

01:32:16.911 --> 01:32:18.785
I wish I could make
things better.

01:32:18.787 --> 01:32:22.540
I hate everything about you!

01:32:22.542 --> 01:32:25.084
Stop it! Stop right now!

01:32:31.259 --> 01:32:33.636
- Oh, no.
- Elizabeth, thank God.

01:32:35.555 --> 01:32:38.513
- Who are you?
- I'm, I'm Elizabeth.

01:32:38.515 --> 01:32:40.641
No, you're not.
Henry, who is she?

01:32:40.643 --> 01:32:42.018
Henry? No.

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.561
He's... He's not Henry.
He's Oliver.

01:32:43.563 --> 01:32:46.856
Don't listen to her.
She's sick in the head, my love.

01:32:46.858 --> 01:32:48.232
I don't know what he's told you

01:32:48.234 --> 01:32:50.108
but there's noth,
there's nothing wrong with me.

01:32:51.945 --> 01:32:55.072
- This is very heavy.
- So, please, put it down.

01:32:55.074 --> 01:32:56.406
You... You have the rifle?

01:32:56.408 --> 01:32:59.117
I have the rifle
and it's very heavy.

01:32:59.119 --> 01:33:01.912
Tell her to get on her belly.

01:33:01.914 --> 01:33:05.750
- Why does she look like me?
- She is an imposter.

01:33:05.752 --> 01:33:07.210
She's very dangerous.
She's our enemy.

01:33:07.212 --> 01:33:09.128
No, I don't... I don't know
what he's told you

01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:11.171
but you and I
are not enemies, okay?

01:33:11.173 --> 01:33:13.424
He's the enemy.
We're prisoners here.

01:33:13.426 --> 01:33:15.677
You hear how crazy she sounds.

01:33:15.679 --> 01:33:17.553
He... He won't let us
out of the house.

01:33:17.555 --> 01:33:20.430
That's all I want to do.
I just... I just want to go.

01:33:20.432 --> 01:33:22.224
But he had me chained in here.
Look.

01:33:22.226 --> 01:33:24.770
I swear to you.
I swear to you, look.

01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:28.981
- Is that true?
- Yes, it's true.

01:33:28.983 --> 01:33:32.943
But I had to to keep her
from hurting herself.

01:33:32.945 --> 01:33:34.778
She insists on going outside.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:36.531
Doesn't want to believe
that the air is not safe!

01:33:36.533 --> 01:33:38.074
- What? No!
- Get on your belly!

01:33:38.076 --> 01:33:40.910
- Forehead on the floor!
- No.

01:33:40.912 --> 01:33:42.285
Elizabeth, please,
put that down.

01:33:42.287 --> 01:33:43.622
Do it.

01:33:45.958 --> 01:33:48.377
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with the air outside.

01:33:53.466 --> 01:33:56.136
F... Forehead on the floor!

01:34:01.890 --> 01:34:03.891
She's down, Henry.

01:34:03.893 --> 01:34:05.310
Now what?

01:34:10.483 --> 01:34:11.898
No!

01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:13.108
Please, don't hurt him!

01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:16.653
Elizabeth, put it down.
Put it down.

01:34:16.655 --> 01:34:19.197
- I can explain everything.
- Let him go!

01:34:19.199 --> 01:34:22.576
Tell her!
Tell her not to shoot!

01:34:22.578 --> 01:34:25.620
I'm sorry.
I love you so much.

01:34:25.622 --> 01:34:28.333
You will get him killed.

01:34:28.335 --> 01:34:30.335
You don't understand
what's really going on.

01:34:30.337 --> 01:34:31.753
- Now put it down.
- Please, don't hurt him.

01:34:31.755 --> 01:34:33.838
- Let him go.
- You and I are the same.

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.173
Please, I beg you...

01:34:35.175 --> 01:34:37.342
You dreamt you would meet
a brilliant man.

01:34:37.344 --> 01:34:39.218
You will steal his breath away

01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:41.763
and he, in turn,
will steal you away

01:34:41.765 --> 01:34:43.180
from everything ugly

01:34:43.182 --> 01:34:45.808
into a secret world of our own.

01:37:21.006 --> 01:37:23.092
Elizabeth..

01:38:16.479 --> 01:38:17.981
Henry?

01:38:20.984 --> 01:38:22.360
I'm here.

01:38:28.783 --> 01:38:30.575
Is everything alright?

01:38:30.577 --> 01:38:32.869
I... I thought I heard..

01:38:32.871 --> 01:38:37.581
I've renegotiated your contract
on your behalf.

01:38:37.583 --> 01:38:41.962
I trust you'll find the changes
satisfactory.

01:38:44.256 --> 01:38:45.839
What did you do to her?

01:38:45.841 --> 01:38:48.425
There's a title transfer
as well.

01:38:48.427 --> 01:38:51.053
Everything I own will be yours

01:38:51.055 --> 01:38:53.598
so that you can continue
your research.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.976
I wouldn't go down there,
Claire.

01:38:56.978 --> 01:39:00.312
I'm calling the police.

01:39:00.314 --> 01:39:03.192
Call them.
What would you tell them?

01:39:05.444 --> 01:39:07.402
A murder has occurred?

01:39:07.404 --> 01:39:10.697
"Who has died, ma'am?"

01:39:10.699 --> 01:39:12.491
Most women hate
being called ma'am.

01:39:12.493 --> 01:39:14.326
It's why men call them.

01:39:14.328 --> 01:39:17.621
"Who has been murdered?
Someone who died years ago?"

01:39:17.623 --> 01:39:20.916
"Are you intoxicated, ma'am?
Have you been drinking?"

01:39:20.918 --> 01:39:23.128
"Are you off your medication,
ma'am?"

01:39:24.506 --> 01:39:26.132
Who are you?

01:39:32.137 --> 01:39:34.722
I didn't set out
to kill the very person

01:39:34.724 --> 01:39:37.767
I've spent my life
trying to revive.

01:39:37.769 --> 01:39:39.311
It just happened.

01:39:42.273 --> 01:39:44.859
Isn't that a remarkable phrase?

01:39:46.027 --> 01:39:49.905
It just happened.

01:39:51.658 --> 01:39:53.700
Elizabeth was mine

01:39:53.702 --> 01:39:56.326
gave herself
of her own free will to me.

01:39:56.328 --> 01:39:58.620
I have it in writing

01:39:58.622 --> 01:39:59.915
and she died.

01:40:01.292 --> 01:40:02.836
But now..

01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:05.922
...she brings me joy..

01:40:07.172 --> 01:40:11.342
...out of the reach
of man's law

01:40:11.344 --> 01:40:13.260
out of reality, as we know it

01:40:13.262 --> 01:40:17.516
by dying over and over..

01:40:18.768 --> 01:40:22.355
...and no one need know
about it.

01:40:23.856 --> 01:40:25.567
I feel no shame.

01:40:27.569 --> 01:40:29.029
There's no consequence.

01:40:30.904 --> 01:40:33.032
You're so sick.

01:40:34.324 --> 01:40:35.659
Maybe.

01:40:39.497 --> 01:40:43.540
But these versions of her

01:40:43.542 --> 01:40:45.711
they're not my Elizabeth.

01:40:47.505 --> 01:40:50.089
And the look in their eyes.

01:40:50.091 --> 01:40:53.386
Somewhere in them, they all knew
it wasn't going to work.

01:40:57.556 --> 01:41:01.810
It was only through the act
of destroying them..

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:06.106
...that they finally
felt real to me.

01:41:10.235 --> 01:41:11.488
Henry..

01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:17.202
...this has to stop.

01:41:19.621 --> 01:41:21.081
Unquestionably.

01:41:31.216 --> 01:41:34.717
I'll do my utmost, Claire.

01:43:09.104 --> 01:43:11.397
Elizabeth.

01:43:11.399 --> 01:43:13.026
Welcome home, Claire.

01:43:15.153 --> 01:43:16.445
Home.

01:43:19.532 --> 01:43:20.742
You've earned it.

01:43:22.202 --> 01:43:24.204
So do something good with it.

01:44:10.875 --> 01:44:13.418
I dreamt I would meet
a brilliant man.

01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:15.044
I would steal his breath away

01:44:15.046 --> 01:44:17.045
and he, in turn,
would steal me away

01:44:17.047 --> 01:44:20.342
from everything ugly
into a secret world of our own.

01:44:23.595 --> 01:44:25.556
But I'm awake now.
