00:05.788 --> 00:07.659
LUANNE:
I hope you packed
your patience.

00:07.703 --> 00:10.010
I have to go to therapy
to talk about how long

00:10.053 --> 00:12.403
it takes me to drive to therapy.

00:12.447 --> 00:15.276
Well, we're just happy to have
a chance to take in the sights.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.321
Well, they say
the Getty's a must-see,

00:17.365 --> 00:19.845
opened up by one of those
famous Gettys.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.064
I think some oil tycoon.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.587
Overhyped, if you ask me.

00:22.631 --> 00:25.025
The only Getty I ever
cared for was Estelle,

00:25.068 --> 00:27.288
may she rest in peace.

00:27.331 --> 00:30.421
Okay, wine?No, thank you.

00:30.465 --> 00:33.076
That's fine,
I always drink for two.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.471
Oh, Dean, I told you
one man's rare book

00:36.514 --> 00:38.473
collection is
another man's Ambien.

00:38.516 --> 00:42.259
We should eat.

00:42.303 --> 00:43.521
This all looks lovely.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.828
We appreciate everything
you're doing for us.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.918
I am glad you came.
I'm serious.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.833
You stay as long as you need.

00:50.876 --> 00:54.445
I promise, one more day.
Two, tops.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.621
Really, it's no trouble.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.668
Well, speaking of trouble,

00:59.711 --> 01:01.887
I'm gonna go get
some more wine.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.197
Nobody move!

01:07.241 --> 01:10.070
Luanne, are you okay?Sit down, shut up!

01:10.113 --> 01:11.636
Please, nobody needs
to get hurt.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.637
Yeah, I'll be
the judge of that.

01:12.681 --> 01:15.292
Give me your jewelry.
All of it.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.557
Come on, the watch.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.516
Come on, give me the watch
or you're dead.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.694
Come on, let's go.
Hurry up.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.522
You, all your jewelry, now.

01:30.612 --> 01:33.963
Lady, I said everything,
or I shoot them both.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.537
Come on.
Come on.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.946
Damn it, what did I say?!

02:03.123 --> 02:06.126
We have to move.
Now!

02:16.919 --> 02:18.921
♪

02:37.244 --> 02:39.507
COOPER:
Tell me what you're drinking,

02:39.550 --> 02:41.944
and I'll tell you who hurt you.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.468
I got a degree in mixology,
but I do a bit of psychology,

02:44.512 --> 02:45.861
if you know what I mean.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.297
Yeah, it's like how
I'm a detective,

02:47.341 --> 02:49.865
but I also dabble in
open-heart surgery on the side.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.171
Yeah.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.303
What is your availability?

02:53.347 --> 02:55.218
Wide open.
Okay.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.394
Except Tuesdays.
I cannot work Tuesdays.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.657
My mind is, like, blah
Tuesdays.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.920
"Blah" Tuesdays.
Got it.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.922
Spelled out with a B-L-A-H...

03:03.966 --> 03:06.577
And Fridays.
No Fridays.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.710
I'm an entrepreneur.
Aspiring.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.233
So, Fridays are for that.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.713
DEEKS: Ha, well, that must
have been my problem here.

03:11.756 --> 03:14.803
I've been doing all
my aspiring on Saturdays.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.326
Yeah, that's a problem.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.241
Do you have any
questions for us?

03:18.285 --> 03:20.025
How long until I'm vested?

03:20.069 --> 03:22.811
Oh, I've always thought of us
as more of a suspenders place,

03:22.854 --> 03:24.726
but I guess we're
open to it.

03:24.769 --> 03:27.119
Well, except flair; we draw
a hard line at flair.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.687
Know what I mean?
No flair.

03:29.731 --> 03:32.690
I'm talking retirement.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.606
401Ks, IRAs.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.826
I'm gonna need to see
your whole portfolio.

03:37.869 --> 03:42.134
BOTH:
Our... port... folio.

03:42.178 --> 03:45.834
We're gonna need to see
some, uh, references.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.618
Why

03:47.662 --> 03:50.273
W-W-We are.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.796
Us. The ones that you

03:51.840 --> 03:53.320
want the job from?

03:53.363 --> 03:54.582
How about a résumé?

03:54.625 --> 03:55.670
You got a résumé?

04:00.152 --> 04:02.677
What, do you think
I was born yesterday?

04:04.374 --> 04:06.681
What

04:06.724 --> 04:08.683
I don't know, but
you know what, we're, um...

04:08.726 --> 04:10.511
We got to cut this short.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.774
Thank you so much
for coming in.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.254
Wait, did I get the job?

04:14.297 --> 04:17.779
Did you get the--
W-W-We'll call you.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.824
How'd you get my number?

04:23.698 --> 04:24.960
CALLEN:
Crazy world we live in.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.701
Yeah, that's why I'm
constantly saving your life.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.703
You think I still have time
to sell my possessions

04:28.746 --> 04:30.182
and move into a bunker?

04:30.226 --> 04:31.967
And leave Beale
to stop the terrorists?

04:32.010 --> 04:33.795
Oh, terrorists are easy.
It's my neighbors
I'm worried about.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.840
You don't have any neighbors.But I'm gonna have neighbors,

04:35.884 --> 04:37.755
and that's why I have
this neighborhood watch app,

04:37.799 --> 04:38.930
so I know what I'm
getting myself into.

04:38.974 --> 04:40.541
Oh, so you're spying.I don't need to spy.

04:40.584 --> 04:41.890
No one's hiding anything.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.979
Reports of vandalism,
streaking.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.807
Susan Reynolds thinks
that Helen Doland

04:45.850 --> 04:47.461
is running an illegal
laundry operation

04:47.504 --> 04:48.853
out of her basement,
and I got to tell you,

04:48.897 --> 04:50.638
I'm kind of on Team Susie
for this one.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.422
Apps are bad news,
they can turn into

04:52.466 --> 04:53.858
mob mentality really quickly.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.164
You're telling me.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.035
Who knew an auction
on a La-Z-Boy recliner

04:57.079 --> 05:00.300
could turn so ugly so fast?

05:00.343 --> 05:01.692
We got a case.

05:01.736 --> 05:04.565
Home invasion at the house
of a senior naval officer.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.131
They sent the address
to our phones.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.655
Do you see what happens when
you don't know your neighbors?

05:07.698 --> 05:09.439
That's what I'm
talking about.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.574
Huh? I speak the truth.

05:13.617 --> 05:16.403
Got to get the app.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.622
Hmm, this isn't right.Tell me about it.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.407
Our game table was supposed
to arrive this morning,

05:20.450 --> 05:22.104
but it's stuck at
a processing center

05:22.147 --> 05:23.584
in La Crosse, Kansas.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.237
And I have questions.Oh, so did I,

05:25.281 --> 05:26.674
so I did some research.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.415
Turns out La Crosse is
the barbed wire capital

05:28.458 --> 05:29.981
of the world.Oh.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.548
Might explain the holdup.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.420
Wait,

05:33.463 --> 05:35.465
did you order the
"Ticket to Ride" game table?

05:35.509 --> 05:36.858
Yeah, it's gonna look good
in our new living room,

05:36.901 --> 05:38.294
when we get one.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.384
Eric, we talked about this.Nell, you love games.

05:41.428 --> 05:44.735
Yeah, and I love tables,
but ne'er the twain shall meet.

05:44.779 --> 05:47.782
Did I mention it's decoupage?

05:47.825 --> 05:49.827
Did I mention
that's déclassé?

05:49.871 --> 05:51.002
Touché.

05:51.046 --> 05:53.396
Oh.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.745
BOTH:
Deputy Director Ochoa.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.530
Nice to see you're
still in town.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.706
Keep this up, I'll have
to rent a room here.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.272
Well, if you're in need
of some furniture,

06:00.316 --> 06:02.623
give me a shout, because I might
have a table you would like.

06:02.666 --> 06:06.844
Or love, depending on your
appreciation of crafts.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.543
Deputy Director Ochoa,

06:09.586 --> 06:11.414
Wow. Fancy meeting you here.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.850
I hear we have a case.

06:12.894 --> 06:16.071
That we do.
Captain Dean Hadlow.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.856
He was critically wounded
last night after being shot

06:18.900 --> 06:20.118
during a home invasion.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.729
The burglars made off
with cash, jewelry,

06:21.772 --> 06:22.947
but most importantly,

06:22.991 --> 06:25.167
Captain Hadlow's laptop.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.951
I'm guessing that cash and
jewelry were just bonus prizes.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.736
What was Hadlow's
current assignment?

06:28.779 --> 06:30.651
Uh, he heads the Navy's new

06:30.694 --> 06:33.175
unmanned
underwater vehicle squadron.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.655
It's a highly classified group.

06:34.698 --> 06:35.830
They're currently
developing advanced

06:35.873 --> 06:37.788
payload delivery systems.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.573
And now his stolen
laptop can be used

06:39.616 --> 06:41.401
as a key to access
and compromise

06:41.444 --> 06:42.837
all of their research.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.839
KENSI: UUVs are being
developed to deliver anything

06:44.882 --> 06:46.797
from surveillance
systems to weapons.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.582
You know that information
would be highly valuable

06:48.625 --> 06:49.626
on the black market.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.758
We get IDs on those gunmen?

06:50.801 --> 06:52.760
Uh, no, not yet,
but this is interesting.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.370
During the time
of the invasion,

06:54.414 --> 06:56.633
Captain Hadlow and his wife
Luanne were having dinner

06:56.677 --> 06:58.809
with General Omar Abidi,
of Pakistan

06:58.853 --> 07:00.463
and his wife, Sahar.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.117
Here on official business?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.553
Uh, none that we can find.

07:03.597 --> 07:06.338
But General Abidi got
his undergrad at UCLA.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.644
He was roommates with Hadlow.

07:07.688 --> 07:08.906
Talk to Hadlow and his wife.

07:08.950 --> 07:09.994
See if they noticed anything
that could help us

07:10.038 --> 07:11.561
track down who did this.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.389
Uh, Callen and Sam are on their
way to the crime scene now.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.260
In that case, we'll
take the hospital.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.392
To the hospital.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.090
This is why I don't go
to class reunions anymore.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.788
Keep me posted.
NELL:
Mm-hmm.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.920
Mm.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.577
CALLEN: Thanks.SAM: Thank you.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.579
CALLEN: LAPD has General Abidi's
wife inside,

07:29.623 --> 07:31.799
but the general took off before
they were able to question him.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.844
Took off where?They don't know.
She's not speaking.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.280
At least not yet.

07:35.324 --> 07:36.978
I asked Nell to try and
track down his rental car.

07:37.021 --> 07:40.242
Innocent people don't
usually run from the cops.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.374
No, they don't.

07:42.418 --> 07:43.637
Any signs of
forced entry?

07:45.552 --> 07:49.033
No. And I think
I know why.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.688
The gunmen didn't break in.
They used the key.

07:53.995 --> 07:55.823
The Abidis were staying
with the Hadlows.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.825
They could have had
access to the lock box.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.261
Plenty of time
to case the place.

07:59.304 --> 08:01.219
Okay, so they hire the thieves
and give them a key.

08:01.263 --> 08:04.005
But if you're organizing it,
why do you run?

08:04.048 --> 08:05.615
Maybe the plan went south.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.836
Captain Hadlow gets shot,
Abidi panics, takes off.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.751
Great, so we're either working
with a burglary gone bad

08:10.794 --> 08:14.015
or an inside job
of international proportions.

08:14.058 --> 08:17.845
Better alert the neighbors.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.761
Boop.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.256
Yeah. Mrs. Hadlow?

08:38.300 --> 08:40.955
Oh, please, Mrs. Hadlow is
a relentless old lady

08:40.998 --> 08:42.957
who will no doubt find a way
to blame this on me.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.349
Call me Luanne.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.655
Uh, Luanne,
we are NCIS,

08:45.699 --> 08:47.135
and we would like
to ask you some questions.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.571
Well, it's about time.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.225
I can't look at one more
of these magazines.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.575
Spoiler alert,
no one wore it best.They never do.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.098
How's your husband doing?

08:54.142 --> 08:56.144
He's still in surgery.
Meredith Grey over there

08:56.187 --> 08:57.798
told me it's looking good,
but I'll believe it

08:57.841 --> 08:59.103
when I hear it from someone
who doesn't look like

08:59.147 --> 09:00.540
they're going to the prom.

09:00.583 --> 09:03.020
We heard you gave them
a run for their money.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.588
I just wish they didn't end up
running away with ours.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.590
Well, we're doing the best
we can to find them.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.244
Did you notice anything

09:09.287 --> 09:11.028
about the men that did this;
hair color, eye color?

09:11.072 --> 09:14.031
Anything like that?They wore masks.
It happened so fast.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.599
Your husband, he close
with General Abidi?

09:16.643 --> 09:18.514
Hardly.
As far as I know,

09:18.558 --> 09:20.603
Dean hadn't even talked
to Omer in years.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.910
Do you know why he and his wife
were at your house?

09:22.953 --> 09:25.521
Two days ago we got a call.
They were at the airport.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.218
Their hotel reservations
had been cancelled.

09:27.262 --> 09:30.221
So you offered to let them
stay with you?Well, Dean was hesitant,

09:30.265 --> 09:32.572
but I love to entertain.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.530
Did the general and his wife
have access to your lock box?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.314
Everyone has access
to that thing.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.012
Handyman, housekeepers.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.014
We're lucky when my daughter
remembers to put the key back.

09:40.057 --> 09:43.017
Just to clarify, that's
Captain Hadlow's stepdaughter?

09:43.060 --> 09:44.845
Emily. Mine, from
a previous marriage.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.543
I had invited her to dinner
last night, and she declined.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.850
Well, we're gonna need
to speak to her at some point.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.765
Good luck if you can find her.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.331
I've been trying
to call her,

09:53.375 --> 09:55.420
but she isn't answering,
and she's not at home.

09:55.464 --> 09:59.033
Oh, God, you don't think
she's in danger, do you?

09:59.076 --> 10:01.601
Not sure of anything
right now, but I promise you

10:01.644 --> 10:03.211
we'll do everything
we can to find her.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.561
Okay. Thank you.DEEKS: Of course.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.998
Thank you for your help.Thank you.

10:08.042 --> 10:10.871
So, uh, her stepdad
almost dies,

10:10.914 --> 10:12.263
and she doesn't bother
to call 'em back?

10:12.307 --> 10:13.351
She really must
have hated him.

10:13.395 --> 10:15.266
Or she's actually in danger.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.920
You want to find out
which one it is?

10:16.964 --> 10:19.227
You know I'm a sucker for a good
"Choose Your Own Adventure."

10:19.270 --> 10:20.663
Uh-uh.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.318
Mrs. Abidi,
we're from NCIS.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.189
Have you found my necklace?

10:25.233 --> 10:26.713
Please, it's very valuable.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.541
We were hoping
to find your husband first.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.369
Why don't you start
by telling us where he is?

10:31.413 --> 10:33.545
IBRAHIM: Gentlemen,
sorry to interrupt.

10:33.589 --> 10:36.636
I'm Ibrahim Alvi,
consular attaché

10:36.679 --> 10:38.333
from the Pakistani consulate,

10:38.376 --> 10:40.291
and this is my assistant
Rebecca Sadat.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.728
Agent Hanna,

10:41.771 --> 10:43.425
this is Agent Callen.
We're NCIS.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.861
It's a pleasure
to be working together.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.212
Wasn't aware
this was a joint investigation.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.736
As an ally of the United States,

10:49.779 --> 10:51.781
the crimes against
one of our citizens

10:51.825 --> 10:54.392
falls within our purview.

10:54.436 --> 10:55.698
And for now,
I have to ask

10:55.742 --> 10:57.700
that you refrain
from speaking with Mrs. Abidi

10:57.744 --> 11:01.617
or any other Pakistani citizen
associated with this case.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.925
She's a witness to the shooting
of a U.S. Navy captain.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.492
And her husband is a criminal
in our country with a warrant

11:07.536 --> 11:09.930
for his arrest.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.671
Looks like we both have
our own cases to solve.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.629
A warrant

11:13.673 --> 11:15.152
IBRAHIM: Unfortunately,
I'm not at liberty

11:15.196 --> 11:16.719
to share that information
with you at this time.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.243
I don't know about any warrant.

11:19.287 --> 11:20.549
What are you talking about?

11:20.592 --> 11:22.116
REBECCA:
The sooner we can find him,

11:22.159 --> 11:24.509
the sooner we'll be able
to clear this up.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.076
I promise.SAM: If you catch up

11:26.120 --> 11:28.165
with General Abidi, we have
a few questions for him.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.125
My friends, if I find him,
he'll be returned to Pakistan

11:31.168 --> 11:32.735
immediately.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.084
Now, if you'll excuse us,
I believe

11:34.128 --> 11:36.347
Mrs. Abidi could use
with some rest.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.393
It's been a long night.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.438
Let's go.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.180
What just happened?

11:43.224 --> 11:46.314
I think we were just given
a time out.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.707
Eh, I don't like that guy.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.361
No. I've seen better allies
on Survivor.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.972
Yeah, and if Abidi
had something to do

11:52.015 --> 11:53.974
with the theft of
Hadlow's computer,

11:54.017 --> 11:56.672
his home country's gonna silence
him before we can prove it.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.413
Unless this whole thing
was just a ruse

11:58.456 --> 12:01.416
to whisk him and our technology
out of the country,

12:01.459 --> 12:03.244
no questions asked.

12:03.287 --> 12:06.508
Then let's find him
before they do.

12:06.551 --> 12:07.857
Let's do it.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.424
DEEKS:
You think Monster.com

12:09.467 --> 12:10.642
deals in barkeeps?

12:10.686 --> 12:12.427
Oh, stop it.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.168
We've barely interviewed anyone.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.778
So hard to find
good help these days.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.259
Just a whole generation
of freeloaders.

12:18.302 --> 12:21.262
Maybe we lower
our expectations a little bit.

12:21.305 --> 12:24.656
You say "we," but
in Blye-speak, you mean "you,"

12:24.700 --> 12:27.268
because you think that Ineed
to lower my expectations.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.400
I'm just saying that
I don't think anybody's

12:29.444 --> 12:31.751
going to tick off
all of your boxes.

12:31.794 --> 12:34.449
Mm, I think I have
a reasonable amount of boxes.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.190
Oh, you think you have
a reasonable amount of boxes?

12:36.233 --> 12:38.758
Yeah.Because I would imagine
that the 18 dog walkers

12:38.801 --> 12:40.672
that we interviewed last
month would disagree.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.065
Okay, well, that's not fair,
because none of them

12:42.109 --> 12:43.501
would agree
to take me on a trial walk.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.765
That's because they walk dogs,
not people.

12:45.808 --> 12:48.028
Okay, all right, mon amie.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.812
Why don't we just keep
our voices down

12:49.856 --> 12:51.596
in that glass house of yours?

12:51.640 --> 12:52.859
What

12:52.902 --> 12:54.817
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.515
Oh, yeah? So the personal
trainer that ran,

12:57.559 --> 13:01.128
nay, sprinted away in tears...Okay.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.565
There are only so many times
that you can hear the phrase,

13:03.608 --> 13:05.393
:
"tiny up, tiny down"

13:05.436 --> 13:06.873
:
in that decibel.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.788
Yeah, she did have Monty
heading for the hills, too.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.225
Ugh, well, shame he didn't have
someone to walk him there.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.922
Ooh, touché. At least now
we're on the same page.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.358
:
We're not on the same page.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.360
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.279
I think maybe we
just need to find

13:22.323 --> 13:24.151
a whole new pool of applicants.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.936
I think we just did.Yeah.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.243
Well, Nell tracked Hadlow's
stepdaughter's phone

13:29.286 --> 13:32.246
to this house, but it does not
appear like anyone is in danger.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.725
Well, maybe she had something
to do with the robbery.

13:33.769 --> 13:34.726
I mean, that's a pretty
rich circle

13:34.770 --> 13:36.554
of friends to keep up with.

13:36.598 --> 13:39.862
If we go in hot, she's just
gonna run and lawyer up.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.429
Okay, well,

13:41.472 --> 13:44.649
I think it's time you dust off
your short shorts.

13:44.693 --> 13:47.000
Dust them off?
Whatever do you mean?

13:47.043 --> 13:49.350
I wear them underneath
just in case. Ha-sha!

13:49.393 --> 13:50.655
That's so weird.

13:50.699 --> 13:51.787
Quick release!No...

13:51.831 --> 13:52.614
No Velcro pants.Straight to the paint.

13:52.657 --> 13:53.920
KENSI:
No!

13:53.963 --> 13:58.098
NELL:
#beautiful, #popular, #blessed.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.796
So, wait a minute, is she
blessed to be beautiful

14:00.840 --> 14:02.493
or blessed to be popular?

14:02.537 --> 14:04.365
I personally like to think
the two go hand in hand.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.670
Ah, you do?
Mm-hmm.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.238
So you found Captain Hadlow's
stepdaughter, huh?

14:08.282 --> 14:09.761
NELL: Allow me to
virtually introduce you

14:09.805 --> 14:11.763
to one Emily Conway.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.026
Everything you need
to know about her

14:13.069 --> 14:15.506
has been conveniently
broadcast online.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.465
Ah, according to her various
feeds, she fancies herself

14:17.508 --> 14:19.467
a celebutante/philanthropist

14:19.510 --> 14:22.513
with a penchant for bottle
service and filtered selfies.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.689
And despite being
in massive amounts of debt,

14:24.733 --> 14:26.430
she somehow manages
to maintain a life

14:26.474 --> 14:29.651
of red carpets
and fancy French champagne.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.696
Ooh, uh, speaking of which,
did you manage to take a look

14:31.740 --> 14:33.655
at that, uh,
trash can I sent you?

14:33.698 --> 14:36.136
You mean, the one that speaks
15 different languages?

14:36.179 --> 14:37.093
Yeah...

14:37.137 --> 14:38.747
Uh, oui. Mais...

14:38.790 --> 14:41.097
non merci.
Oh.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.751
Let me guess,
you ordered that, too?Well, yeah.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.535
I thought it would go really
nice in our new kitchen,

14:44.579 --> 14:46.581
which we don't have yet,
but we will.

14:46.624 --> 14:47.843
Eric.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.062
It's supposed
to arrive tomorrow,

14:49.105 --> 14:50.759
unless that's also stuck
in La Crosse.

14:50.802 --> 14:51.934
Ooh, it's downtown.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.241
Huzzah! Barbed wire be damned.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.808
No, no. I just got a hit
on General Abidi's rental car.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.072
It was ticketed ten minutes
ago outside Grand Park.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.857
I'll let Callen and Sam know.Yep.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.948
He's smart to pick
a public place.

15:05.992 --> 15:09.647
Sometimes it's easier
to hide in plain sight.

15:12.346 --> 15:13.825
I got eyes on Abidi.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.049
We may have company.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.879
He's got a gun. Federal agents!

15:26.838 --> 15:27.839
I got Abidi.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.758
Hey!

15:39.851 --> 15:41.331
Get down! Get down!

15:44.030 --> 15:45.509
Down!

16:16.976 --> 16:18.412
Uh, please.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.719
Don't kill me.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.476
CALLEN:
Thanks, Nell.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.956
Gunman had no
ID on him.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.871
Looks like he was using
a burner phone.

16:42.914 --> 16:46.701
It's time to find out
what Abidi was doing downtown.

16:53.273 --> 16:54.665
Who are you?

16:54.709 --> 16:57.146
Robert Fenton, State Department.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.281
What's the opposite
of a pleasant surprise?

17:02.673 --> 17:05.198
I need to speak to General
Omer Abidi immediately.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.590
Well, get in line.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.418
He's a suspect
wanted in connection

17:08.462 --> 17:10.333
with a crime
against the U.S. Navy.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.856
This is our jurisdiction.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.684
He didn't steal
Captain Hadlow's computer,

17:13.728 --> 17:15.730
if that's
what you mean.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.732
Then why did he flee
the scene of the crime?

17:17.775 --> 17:19.429
Because I asked him to.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.344
He was downtown
to meet me.

17:21.388 --> 17:25.435
Now, that's the opposite
of a pleasant surprise.

17:32.964 --> 17:34.792
Well, we can call off
the search,

17:34.836 --> 17:36.968
'cause evidently,
nobody in this city works.

17:37.012 --> 17:39.580
KENSI: Well, you wouldn't either
if you got to do this every day.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.103
Well, that's where you're wrong.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.800
These people may think
this is paradise,

17:42.844 --> 17:44.715
but I'm pretty sure
this is Dawn of the Dead.

17:44.759 --> 17:47.762
Except for all these zombies
are wearing deep Vs.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.199
Well, you know, not everyone's
idea of fun is sitting

17:50.243 --> 17:51.548
on a couch all night,

17:51.592 --> 17:54.116
binge-watching reruns
of This Old House.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.118
Oh, how dare you?
We both know

17:56.162 --> 17:59.861
that Bob Vila's voice
is a sound bath from heaven.

17:59.904 --> 18:02.690
Ha! Dude, snap me.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.823
I'm sorry, I don't speak frat.

18:05.867 --> 18:06.868
Well, let's go, brah.
I want to get the sun

18:06.911 --> 18:08.391
while it's on my good side.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.785
While it's on your-- you gonna
flex your tricep and...?

18:10.828 --> 18:12.439
Definitely do that.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.528
That's actually
a really good picture.

18:14.571 --> 18:15.833
Yeah, we got it.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.400
Okay.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.532
What's this?

18:18.575 --> 18:20.142
Oh! Oh, good, we got a card.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.407
Nice to see we don't have
a shortage of entrepreneurs.

18:24.451 --> 18:25.756
What

18:25.800 --> 18:29.108
Oh! Yeah.
Slide that photo into my DMs.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.632
Yeah, that's definitely...
not gonna happen.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.416
You'd probably have
to buy me a drink first.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.896
Oh, look at you.:
Hi.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.027
Can you snap a shot at me?

18:36.071 --> 18:38.378
Yeah. Got to be honest,

18:38.421 --> 18:40.119
in a sea full of meatheads,

18:40.162 --> 18:42.164
I'm starting to feel like
the biggest piece of meat here.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.600
Well, you definitely are
the biggest piece of meat--

18:43.644 --> 18:45.515
behind me, Deeks.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.300
Emily Conway is behind me.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.650
Oh. Well.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.392
Ooh, looks like we got
some trouble in paradise, huh?

18:53.828 --> 18:57.397
Yeah. She does not look pleased.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.007
Well, you know what they say.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.229
Keep your
friends close,

19:03.272 --> 19:05.753
keep your frenemies closer.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.581
I don't think anybody says that.

19:07.624 --> 19:08.799
No, they do.Nope.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.192
No, they really do.You just made that up.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.368
I've heard it.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.109
FENTON:
Captain Hadlow gave my number

19:14.153 --> 19:15.893
to General Abidi,
he called me,

19:15.937 --> 19:17.634
he said he had
information for me.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.680
Well, it must be valuable
if you agreed to meet with him.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.857
He claims to have the location
of five prominent Taliban camps

19:22.900 --> 19:25.425
located throughout Northern
Pakistan, as well as

19:25.468 --> 19:27.296
the names of everyone
who works there.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.993
U.S. has been after
that information for years.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.821
Pakistan was never willing
to come to the table with it.

19:30.865 --> 19:33.346
And in spite of us withholding
millions of dollars

19:33.389 --> 19:35.217
in military aid,
they still aren't.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.914
They have no intention
of sharing with us.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.742
And they don't want
General Abidi to, either.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.179
CALLEN: Well, they
must've gotten wind

19:40.222 --> 19:41.832
that he was gonna
leak the information,

19:41.876 --> 19:44.400
so they issued the warrant for
his arrest to keep him quiet.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.663
Abidi may be trying
to trade intel for asylum.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.099
He wants to defect.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.840
But he wanted to
do it quietly.

19:49.884 --> 19:52.103
He wasn't behind the robbery.
He was in the wrong place

19:52.147 --> 19:54.105
at the wrong time and
his cover was blown.

19:54.149 --> 19:56.282
That alerted the consulate
that he was here.

19:56.325 --> 19:57.370
Now Pakistan wants
to arrest him,

19:57.413 --> 19:58.849
and someone else wants him dead.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.634
The general and his wife
are to be on a plane

20:00.677 --> 20:03.376
back to Pakistan in three hours.

20:03.419 --> 20:06.074
We're gonna need
more time than that.

20:06.117 --> 20:08.250
And I need George
Clooney's head of hair.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.644
Some things are
beyond our control.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.826
First off, I want you to know

20:18.869 --> 20:22.046
this little plan of yours
has nothing to do with us.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.484
I never asked for your help.

20:24.527 --> 20:27.748
Well, technically, you did.

20:27.791 --> 20:32.231
If they get me on a plane back
home, I'm going to jail.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.494
It makes sense. Your country
thinks you're a traitor.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.974
They'd be right about that.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.802
Why turn against them?

20:38.846 --> 20:40.630
They turned on me.

20:40.674 --> 20:43.503
For 20 years,
I served my country.

20:43.546 --> 20:47.855
For 20 years, I did what
was right by my people.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.815
Are either of you fathers?

20:51.859 --> 20:53.904
I am.

20:53.948 --> 20:56.211
As am I.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.648
At least, I used to be.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.868
That all changed

21:00.911 --> 21:03.914
five years ago

21:03.958 --> 21:06.177
when my daughter was slain
on the streets of Islamabad

21:06.221 --> 21:07.396
by the Taliban.

21:07.440 --> 21:10.921
She left our house
to meet friends

21:10.965 --> 21:13.533
for dinner.

21:13.576 --> 21:17.667
Barely made it to the end of
the block when a bomb exploded,

21:17.711 --> 21:19.930
destroying her life story

21:19.974 --> 21:22.759
and my heart in a flash.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.330
Another victim
in a war my country

21:28.374 --> 21:30.114
is too weak to fight.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.815
We're sorry for your loss.

21:34.858 --> 21:38.645
Don't be sorry for my loss.

21:38.688 --> 21:41.343
Be sorry for the countless
other mothers and fathers

21:41.387 --> 21:42.866
who will see
the streets lined

21:42.910 --> 21:45.913
with their
children's blood.

21:45.956 --> 21:50.047
I have an allegiance
to my country,

21:50.091 --> 21:52.354
but I have an obligation
to my daughter.

21:52.398 --> 21:55.183
And I tried to convince

21:55.226 --> 21:58.839
my country that they do, too,
but they disagreed.

21:58.882 --> 22:03.713
That information is their
only bargaining chip.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.368
If they give it to us, all
their cards are on the table.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.763
They are also afraid
of the Taliban.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.982
And rightly so.

22:12.026 --> 22:14.637
But if my country will not
fight the battle,

22:14.681 --> 22:16.378
then I need to bring the battle

22:16.422 --> 22:18.598
to someone who will.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.730
Then why haven't you
turned over the information?

22:20.774 --> 22:24.734
I lived a very fortunate
lifestyle back in my country.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.738
But we were forced
to leave all of it behind

22:28.782 --> 22:32.176
with nothing but the clothes
on our back and a smart watch

22:32.220 --> 22:36.355
that my wife had given me
for my birthday. Said it would

22:36.398 --> 22:40.402
count my steps.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.622
It also read texts

22:42.665 --> 22:44.537
and stored documents.

22:44.580 --> 22:48.062
You uploaded the location
and names of the Taliban camps

22:48.105 --> 22:49.629
to that watch.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.413
Let me guess,

22:51.457 --> 22:54.285
the watch got stolen along
with Captain Hadlow's laptop.

22:54.329 --> 22:57.419
It doesn't matter
what they do to me,

22:57.463 --> 23:00.857
but you need to protect my wife.

23:06.863 --> 23:08.474
This isn't our case.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.650
Yeah, but finding
Hadlow's laptop is.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.565
If we find it,

23:12.608 --> 23:14.741
we may be able find that watch

23:14.784 --> 23:16.090
and then she wouldn't
need any protection.

23:23.053 --> 23:25.839
Any luck IDing the, uh,
gunman from Grand Park?

23:25.882 --> 23:27.710
Facial rec hasn't
turned up any hits.

23:27.754 --> 23:28.711
Hm, let me guess,

23:28.755 --> 23:30.496
he bought the burn phone
in cash.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.367
If only they'd leave a trail.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.022
Mm. Lucky for us,
Emily's entire life is a trail.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.893
Yeah, who needs a warrant
when everything we're after

23:36.937 --> 23:38.765
is up for public consumption?

23:38.808 --> 23:40.854
Seriously, I've never
even met this girl and I know

23:40.897 --> 23:42.812
where she shops, where she eats,

23:42.856 --> 23:44.553
and who she splits
her groceries with.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.642
Hey, it's not just
the Emily Conways of the world.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.818
My Aunt Gertie
is literally incapable

23:48.862 --> 23:50.646
of having a private thought.

23:50.690 --> 23:54.084
She's very opinionated
about urban gardening.
Hm.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.043
Maybe there's a silver lining
here after all.

23:56.086 --> 23:57.697
Exactly. Who knew
you could grow turnips

23:57.740 --> 24:00.308
off the side of a fire escape?Oh, not that,

24:00.351 --> 24:02.092
though highly interesting.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.704
I just ID'd the tattooed man
who was arguing with Emily.

24:04.747 --> 24:06.706
He was tagged in one
of her photos.

24:06.749 --> 24:10.231
Say hello
to a Lucas Walker.

24:10.274 --> 24:11.711
Hello, Lucas Walker.

24:11.754 --> 24:13.103
I'm guessing you don't
have a criminal record.

24:13.147 --> 24:14.714
Not yet,
but the two men

24:14.757 --> 24:16.585
standing next to him
in this photo he posted

24:16.629 --> 24:18.108
two days ago do,
and they are

24:18.152 --> 24:19.458
no stranger to breaking
and entering.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.591
If General Abidi isn't
behind this robbery,

24:22.635 --> 24:27.117
we may have just found out who
stole Captain Hadlow's laptop.

24:29.642 --> 24:32.819
Well, looks like our celebutante
might be hiding something.

24:32.862 --> 24:34.777
We got to do
this quietly,

24:34.821 --> 24:36.083
otherwise it'll
end up on the Internet

24:36.126 --> 24:37.824
faster than these
people spray on tan.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.390
Mm-hmm.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.654
O.M.G.

24:41.697 --> 24:44.526
Sorry, excuse me,
but your hair looks amazing.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.746
I woke up like this.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.051
Are you serious?
She wakes up like this?

24:48.095 --> 24:49.531
That's crazy. Anyway,
I really want to take

24:49.575 --> 24:51.141
a picture with you,
but this light is way too harsh.

24:51.185 --> 24:52.926
We could just...Okay, we are in the middle
of something.

24:52.969 --> 24:54.797
Oh, sorry.
Brah.

24:54.841 --> 24:58.322
If your ladybird isn't
insta-famous now, she will be

24:58.366 --> 25:00.194
after we take this photo.
Let's go.
Let's do it.

25:00.237 --> 25:02.065
I suggest you back off
very quickly.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.545
Okay, you know what,
how about this?

25:03.589 --> 25:05.591
I suggest you do what
we say very quietly.

25:05.634 --> 25:08.245
We are NCIS and we have
to ask you a few questions.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.247
So just take it easy
and come with us, okay?

25:12.119 --> 25:13.207
Get over here.

25:17.254 --> 25:19.213
Oh! Wow.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.823
Yup.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.478
Oh, yeah.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.958
That's gonna
get a lot of likes.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.144
Let me get this straight.

25:37.187 --> 25:38.972
General Abidi is willing
to give us the location

25:39.015 --> 25:41.583
of five Taliban camps
spread throughout Pakistan?

25:41.627 --> 25:43.759
So he says, but we still
don't have any proof.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.022
And may I remind you we still
don't have the whereabouts

25:46.066 --> 25:48.111
of Captain Hadlow's computer.
What I do have is SECNAV

25:48.155 --> 25:49.722
breathing down my neck
to find it.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.680
Well, Kensi and Deeks
are questioning

25:51.724 --> 25:53.029
Hadlow's stepdaughter now.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.553
She may be able
to lead us to it.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.902
And if we find it,

25:55.945 --> 25:58.078
we also find the intel
on those Taliban camps.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.732
We're running out of time.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.385
State Department just picked up
General Abidi from the boatshed.

26:01.429 --> 26:02.952
They're on their way
to pick up his wife next.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.214
Hold on. He's willing
to give us information

26:04.258 --> 26:05.781
that could save
our men and women

26:05.825 --> 26:07.478
on the ground, okay?
Not to mention the citizens

26:07.522 --> 26:09.176
of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

26:09.219 --> 26:11.352
I remind you that we are allies.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.396
Knowingly taking
that information

26:12.440 --> 26:13.876
from Abidi
could change that.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.051
The State Department's
not gonna take that chance.

26:15.095 --> 26:16.139
They're overruling us.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.880
Then go above them.

26:17.924 --> 26:20.448
Well, in order to do that,
I need hard evidence,

26:20.491 --> 26:24.104
and right now you two have very
little time left to find it.

26:31.764 --> 26:34.418
How about you start by telling
us what the hell is going on?

26:34.462 --> 26:37.944
What's going on
is my hair is a frizzy mess

26:37.987 --> 26:39.249
because of the humidity
down here.

26:39.293 --> 26:42.688
Oh.
You may be okay
with that, but I'm not.

26:42.731 --> 26:44.037
All right,
sweetheart, listen.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.821
You and your One Direction
boyfriend here

26:45.865 --> 26:47.083
need to start talking.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.259
He's not my boyfriend.Oh, well.

26:49.303 --> 26:52.611
Your mother and your stepfather
are in the hospital.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.918
They're in the hospital?
What are you talking about?

26:55.962 --> 26:57.311
Oh, don't play dumb.

26:57.354 --> 26:58.747
DEEKS: You knew they were
having that dinner party

26:58.791 --> 27:00.531
and you knew it was
with their rich friends.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.664
I-I didn't go to that dinner.Oh, no,

27:02.708 --> 27:04.971
but you sent your boyfriend
in your place.

27:05.014 --> 27:08.061
DEEKS:
Are you not listening?

27:08.104 --> 27:09.062
She said that NSYNC here
is not her boyfriend.
My bad.

27:09.105 --> 27:10.150
Lucas, what are they
talking about?

27:10.193 --> 27:13.066
What did you do?

27:13.109 --> 27:15.503
You already blew it with her,
don't blow it with us.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.161
I just wanted
to take care of you.

27:21.204 --> 27:23.990
But you have
expensive taste.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.035
You told me you wanted me
to start showing initiative.

27:26.079 --> 27:27.471
I meant get a job.

27:27.515 --> 27:28.908
No one would hire me.

27:28.951 --> 27:31.824
Yeah, well, not everyone
checks all the boxes.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.303
DEEKS: So you found out
about the dinner,

27:33.347 --> 27:35.697
you got your buddies together,
and you took the Hadlows

27:35.741 --> 27:37.133
and their friends
for all they were worth.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.570
And you almost killed
one of them in the process.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.268
LUCAS: I never meant
for that to happen.

27:41.311 --> 27:42.530
We were only supposed
to take the things

27:42.573 --> 27:43.705
we knew we could sell.

27:43.749 --> 27:44.924
DEEKS:
Then you and your

27:44.967 --> 27:46.926
pesky friends would've
gotten away with it,

27:46.969 --> 27:49.232
but one of those things
compromised highly-classified

27:49.276 --> 27:51.844
government intelligence.And another one of those things

27:51.887 --> 27:53.106
caused a diplomatic nightmare.

27:53.149 --> 27:54.716
But I bet you
didn't mean

27:54.760 --> 27:57.937
for that to happen either,
huh, Backstreet Boy?

27:57.980 --> 28:01.157
Name, address of who
you sold the stuff to.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.469
Billy Friedman.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.689
He has a place
in Mid-City.

28:12.429 --> 28:16.912
Nice work, Harry Styles.
Proud of you.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.717
Ready?

28:38.760 --> 28:40.675
One, two...

28:40.719 --> 28:43.939
MAN :
Hello, welcome back to all
of our believers out there.

28:43.983 --> 28:47.421
Uh, just joining us...

28:51.555 --> 28:54.080
DEEKS: One, two, three...Federal Agents!

28:54.123 --> 28:56.169
Billy Friedman. Hands up.
Move away from the desk.

28:56.212 --> 28:57.605
Now. Nice and easy.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.825
I knew you'd come.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.304
Oh, yeah?
What tipped you off?

29:01.348 --> 29:05.526
You live like an outlaw,
you go down like an outlaw.

29:07.049 --> 29:09.095
Lot of outlaws live
in their pajamas, huh?

29:10.270 --> 29:11.750
Yeah, I'm thinking
Billy the Kid

29:11.793 --> 29:13.012
wasn't fluent in Excel.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.666
What exactly are you doing here?

29:15.710 --> 29:17.843
You heard of eBay? Same thing.

29:17.886 --> 29:19.714
I'm guessing you're
harder to find.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.063
DEEKS: Well, let's hope this
stuff that you bought from

29:21.107 --> 29:22.891
Lucas Walker
isn't harder to find

29:22.935 --> 29:24.110
because we need it.

29:24.153 --> 29:24.980
No! G...

29:25.024 --> 29:26.416
No, Billy.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.552
Wow, that looked like it hurt.

29:31.595 --> 29:34.076
Would you consider that a good
decision or a bad decision?

29:34.120 --> 29:35.643
:
A bad decision.

29:35.686 --> 29:36.775
All right,
flipping over.

29:38.037 --> 29:41.040
I found Captain Hadlow's laptop.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.216
You got General Abidi's
smart watch?

29:45.174 --> 29:46.785
Bingo.

29:46.828 --> 29:49.875
You may have just bought him and
his wife a little bit of time.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.572
One of our boys can take this
to Hadlow's house.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.182
If they hurry,
they can cut them off.

29:53.226 --> 29:55.794
Hey, Saunders, can you give this
to Callen and Sam, please?

29:55.837 --> 29:58.753
Yep.
Thank you.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.668
How you doing

30:00.711 --> 30:02.975
Not good. That's right.

30:03.018 --> 30:05.064
That's the sound
of a bad decision.

30:05.107 --> 30:07.718
Just to clarify.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.161
Thanks, Saunders.

30:17.424 --> 30:18.686
Just who we
wanted to see.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.035
It's too late.
CALLEN:
What do you mean?

30:20.079 --> 30:21.471
There's an hour until
their plane leaves.

30:21.515 --> 30:23.996
My assistant is taking them
back to the consulate

30:24.039 --> 30:26.215
as we speak. From there,
they'll head on

30:26.259 --> 30:28.827
to LAX and be on a plane
to Pakistan to answer

30:28.870 --> 30:30.611
for their actions.
I see you have

30:30.654 --> 30:32.308
the General's watch.
I'll take that off your hands.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.660
Agent Hanna.

30:36.704 --> 30:37.879
The information on this watch

30:37.923 --> 30:39.489
will help save
your people and ours.

30:39.533 --> 30:42.057
It can, but it'll have to be
released the right way,

30:42.101 --> 30:44.886
on our terms. We will
not be intimidated

30:44.930 --> 30:46.975
or bullied
by your country.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.107
So you are harboring terrorists.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.891
We're fighting
the war on terror

30:49.935 --> 30:50.979
alongside you,

30:51.023 --> 30:52.633
and have been
for years.

30:52.676 --> 30:54.200
We play by your rules.

30:54.243 --> 30:56.593
Sometimes you need
to play by ours.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.247
Fenton, you can't seriously
be letting this happen.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.902
We don't steal secrets
from our allies.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.034
Not officially.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.951
My hands are tied.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.049
This isn't right.

31:17.092 --> 31:20.182
His hands are tied.
Ours aren't, yet.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.104
You said you were
gonna help them.

31:29.148 --> 31:31.367
No, I said I'd try; this is
above all our pay grades.

31:31.411 --> 31:32.978
General Abidi is trying
to do the right thing

31:33.021 --> 31:35.937
and you know that.I know that he's
doing it unethically.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.243
Just because that
flies in here

31:37.286 --> 31:38.722
doesn't mean it does out there.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.508
Speaking of unethical,
we weren't able to get

31:41.551 --> 31:43.162
an ID on the man who tried
to kill General Abidi

31:43.205 --> 31:46.817
at Grand Park and the store
we traced the burn phone to,

31:46.861 --> 31:47.993
dead end as well.

31:48.036 --> 31:49.951
Is there a good part coming,
Ms. Jones?

31:49.995 --> 31:51.910
Oh, yes, there is.

31:51.953 --> 31:55.696
So, we traced all the numbers
from his cell phone.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.567
Turns out he received
a call an hour before

31:57.611 --> 31:59.787
he tried to kill General Abidi.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.920
That call was from...
Rebecca Sadat.

32:05.010 --> 32:07.273
Assistant to
the consular attaché.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.014
The same Rebecca Sadat

32:09.057 --> 32:12.147
that is driving General Abidi
and his wife to the consulate.

32:12.191 --> 32:14.671
She's not driving them
to the consulate.

32:27.075 --> 32:29.164
Pakistani consulate can't
get ahold of Rebecca Sadat.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.209
What do we know about her?

32:30.252 --> 32:31.862
Well, she's a British national,

32:31.906 --> 32:33.516
she's got her
degree from Oxford,

32:33.560 --> 32:36.041
Masters in International
Relations from Cambridge.

32:36.084 --> 32:38.043
She transferred here from
the High Commission Office

32:38.086 --> 32:40.045
in London five years ago.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.742
When did she go off track?

32:41.785 --> 32:44.223
Well, her father was
an anthropology professor.

32:44.266 --> 32:45.920
He taught at several
universities

32:45.964 --> 32:47.878
throughout the Middle
East and he would

32:47.922 --> 32:49.184
take Rebecca with him
on assignment

32:49.228 --> 32:50.533
when she was very young.

32:50.577 --> 32:52.448
She would have been
impressionable back then.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.189
Taliban might have been grooming
her since she was a child.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.321
Could have been spying
on Pakistan

32:55.364 --> 32:57.149
for years.
NELL: She was
brainwashed.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.586
Which means she believes
what she's doing is right.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.109
Hey. Rebecca Sadat
just got off the 405.

33:01.153 --> 33:02.545
Okay, where is she headed?

33:02.589 --> 33:04.069
I checked flight manifests
at all nearby airports;

33:04.112 --> 33:05.418
there's a private plane
at Van Nuys

33:05.461 --> 33:07.028
headed for Pakistan.NELL: Oh, God.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.812
It's probably waiting to deliver

33:08.856 --> 33:10.989
General Abidi and his wife
to the Taliban.

33:11.902 --> 33:14.079
Thank God for L.A. traffic.

33:16.820 --> 33:20.302
She gets on that plane,
they're as good as dead.

33:20.346 --> 33:23.001
Nell, contact FAA, TSA, DoT,

33:23.044 --> 33:25.003
whoever it takes to delay
that plane from taking off.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.048
Yep, I'm on it.Kensi, talk to me.

33:27.092 --> 33:29.442
KENSI :
We're following parallel
on Balboa.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.618
All right, I want you on board
that plane when Sadat arrives

33:31.661 --> 33:34.142
and plan on taking her down
as quietly as we can.

33:34.186 --> 33:35.274
Copy that.

33:35.317 --> 33:37.145
I got dibs on the hot towels.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.547
CALLEN: Got eyes on Sadat's
van, we're on her tail.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.166
SAM:
Change of plans.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.472
CALLEN:
It was a good plan.

33:59.515 --> 34:00.690
Yeah, until they
started shooting at us.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.085
We'll go around,
cut her off from the front.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.087
DEEKS: That's a stop sign.
Okay, I should have driven--

34:06.131 --> 34:07.697
Whoo! Oh, my lord!

34:10.135 --> 34:12.137
Oh, my God, I should have drove.Stop talking!

34:15.140 --> 34:16.489
Let's get married.
Let's get married right now!

34:21.233 --> 34:23.409
KENSI:
They're not gonna stop;

34:23.452 --> 34:25.193
we're not gonna stop.Okay, that's plan "A,"
what is plan "B"?

34:25.237 --> 34:27.195
I don't like plan "A."

34:27.239 --> 34:29.980
Son of a rat bird!She's not stopping.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.722
KENSI: Hold on, babe.
Oh, God.

34:32.766 --> 34:33.984
They're not stopping.
Kens!

34:39.686 --> 34:40.861
On the ground, now!

34:42.515 --> 34:43.994
Drop your weapon!

34:51.741 --> 34:53.178
Rebecca Sadat, it's over!

34:53.221 --> 34:54.222
Come out with your hands up!

34:56.398 --> 34:57.791
Stand back!

34:59.836 --> 35:02.100
This isn't gonna
end well for you.

35:02.143 --> 35:05.059
You don't get to decide
my ending; I remind you,

35:05.103 --> 35:06.539
I have diplomatic immunity.

35:06.582 --> 35:08.149
We may not be able to touch you,
but you'll be punished

35:08.193 --> 35:09.368
the moment you get sent
back to your country.

35:09.411 --> 35:10.934
Now put the weapon down.

35:10.978 --> 35:14.068
:
If I let her go,

35:14.112 --> 35:16.157
she'll be hunted
for the rest of her life.

35:16.201 --> 35:19.291
That's no way to live;
I'm doing her a favor.

35:21.380 --> 35:22.946
Abidi, stand back!

35:22.990 --> 35:25.601
You'll pay for what you're doing
to our country.

35:25.645 --> 35:27.690
I have allegiance to no
country or government.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.910
At least not one that
you'd recognize.

35:29.953 --> 35:30.911
I don't have a shot.

35:30.954 --> 35:33.043
The people you answer to

35:33.087 --> 35:34.828
took my daughter's life.

35:37.352 --> 35:40.312
Please, don't make me watch
as you take my wife's.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.144
If you insist.

36:04.118 --> 36:05.641
Hey, I need
to tell you something.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.818
Oh, let me guess: you ordered
the strobe light Carpet Bot.

36:08.862 --> 36:11.995
Um, no, but I love vacuuming
and you love voguing

36:12.039 --> 36:13.954
and perhaps one day
the twain shall meet.

36:13.997 --> 36:18.480
But until then, I cancelled all
pending furniture deliveries.

36:18.524 --> 36:20.221
You did?

36:20.265 --> 36:21.918
Well, technically, no.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.703
But once the good people
of La Crosse find them all,

36:23.746 --> 36:27.185
I will, I promise. No more.

36:27.228 --> 36:29.970
No, no, I don't want you
to promise me that.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.624
I just would like
to fill our lives

36:31.667 --> 36:34.061
with things that we both love.

36:34.104 --> 36:35.889
So how about we just focus

36:35.932 --> 36:37.543
on finding an apartment first?

36:37.586 --> 36:39.022
And then we can worry about

36:39.066 --> 36:41.895
you know, how we fit
in it together.

36:41.938 --> 36:44.985
And then we'll
fill up the space.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.336
I kind of like
this space right here.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.511
Oh.

36:49.555 --> 36:52.601
DEEKS :
Oh, my virgin eyes!

36:52.645 --> 36:54.255
Oh, get a room!
Hmm.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.430
We're working
on it.

36:55.474 --> 36:58.041
Uh, so, how are
you kids doing?

36:58.085 --> 36:59.042
We're okay.

36:59.086 --> 37:00.740
How's Captain Hadlow?

37:00.783 --> 37:02.176
Oh. Just out of surgery

37:02.220 --> 37:03.743
and expected to make
a full recovery.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.571
Speaking of which,
did we get a full recovery

37:05.614 --> 37:07.007
of everything that was stolen
from his house?

37:07.050 --> 37:09.923
Uh, everything except
Mrs. Abidi's necklace.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.141
By the way, how are they doing?

37:11.185 --> 37:12.969
Well, Ibrahim Alvi
is working with

37:13.013 --> 37:14.449
the State Department
to grant them asylum.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.277
He is very embarrassed
to have had

37:16.321 --> 37:18.018
a Taliban spy
working under him,

37:18.061 --> 37:19.411
so he wants this swept under
the rug as soon as possible.

37:19.454 --> 37:22.065
Understandable.Well, on that note,

37:22.109 --> 37:25.286
we are gonna find
a way to chillax.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.896
I got three words for you:

37:26.940 --> 37:30.639
This Old--wait for it-- House. Oh, my God.

37:30.683 --> 37:34.295
Bob Vila's voice is like the
sound of slowly sliced butter.

37:34.339 --> 37:35.688
That's what I said.

37:35.731 --> 37:36.776
I didn't know you loved him.

37:36.819 --> 37:37.864
I love that show.What?

37:37.907 --> 37:39.169
It's my ringtone.
Really?

37:39.213 --> 37:40.562
Oh, my God, that beard...Okay, guys.

37:40.606 --> 37:41.781
Cool, we're gonna...Get the DVR, we...

37:41.824 --> 37:43.913
That sounds like
a lot of fun.
Love you.

37:43.957 --> 37:45.263
We should...
You know what I'm
talking about there.

37:45.306 --> 37:47.352
See you, bye. Okay.We could do a Bob Vila date.

37:53.923 --> 37:55.490
Time to go.

37:55.534 --> 37:57.231
We've got a flight
to Montana to catch.

37:58.493 --> 38:00.016
ABIDI:
Thank you.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.845
You didn't have to help us,
but you did.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.238
Well, you didn't leave us much
of a choice, but...

38:05.587 --> 38:07.241
it was our pleasure.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.115
I'm sorry we didn't find
your necklace.

38:14.117 --> 38:15.641
It was my daughter's necklace.

38:15.684 --> 38:19.209
Barely worth a dollar.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.428
She wore it all the time.

38:20.472 --> 38:23.039
And I thought it was all
I had left of her.

38:23.083 --> 38:25.564
But I was wrong.

38:25.607 --> 38:28.001
I have her memories

38:28.044 --> 38:33.049
and her strength and now
I must have her optimism.

38:36.444 --> 38:40.405
I am only sorry you were
unable to use my information.

38:40.448 --> 38:41.797
Sorry for you, for me.

38:43.146 --> 38:45.366
For all the future victims
we could have saved.

38:45.410 --> 38:48.238
It turns out, we were too late.

38:48.282 --> 38:49.979
It was posted on a dark net

38:50.023 --> 38:51.938
auction site
before we could stop it.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.071
The United States
won that auction.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.943
Now we have to monitor

38:56.986 --> 39:00.250
those camps very closely.

39:03.906 --> 39:05.255
You two take care of yourself.

39:13.481 --> 39:15.178
It's amazing how doing
the right thing can

39:15.222 --> 39:17.746
get so very
complicated.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.226
It's not easy.

39:19.269 --> 39:21.968
Starting over.

39:22.011 --> 39:24.057
New lives, new town.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.842
I may have to
recommend a certain app

39:26.886 --> 39:28.061
to help them settle in.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.019
That reminds me; are
you in the market for

39:30.063 --> 39:31.673
a single red sock?

39:31.717 --> 39:33.283
Because I just saw someone
post that they're selling one.

39:33.327 --> 39:36.156
Not two, just a
single red sock.

39:36.199 --> 39:38.724
They're gonna have to post
a missing persons report

39:38.767 --> 39:40.639
if you keep talking.

39:40.682 --> 39:41.814
I don't want a red sock.

39:41.857 --> 39:43.076
You're out on the sock?

39:43.119 --> 39:44.469
I'm out, thank you.

39:44.512 --> 39:46.253
Okay.

39:46.296 --> 39:48.298
Then I'm not gonna tell
you about anything else.

39:48.342 --> 39:49.909
If that's how
it's gonna be.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.042
You gonna get
in the car?

39:53.086 --> 39:55.044
Yeah.

39:55.088 --> 39:57.046
Neighbor.

40:00.441 --> 40:03.183
: Oh,
I'm so glad

40:03.226 --> 40:04.532
we didn't grow up
in this day and age.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.273
I mean, just the
pressure, you know?

40:06.316 --> 40:09.407
It's a miracle these kids
even make it through DJ academy.

40:09.450 --> 40:13.193
No. I'm talking about, like, the
need to be perfect all the time.

40:13.236 --> 40:15.195
What are you talking about?
We areperfect.

40:15.238 --> 40:16.979
We would have been fine.
What are you drinking?

40:17.023 --> 40:19.460
Ah. Let's do...

40:19.504 --> 40:20.853
two Sazeracs.

40:20.896 --> 40:22.855
Two Sazeracs.
That sounds delicious.

40:22.898 --> 40:26.032
Quick question:
What exactly is
in a Sazerac?

40:26.075 --> 40:28.208
WOMAN:
Rye, absinthe and bitters.

40:28.251 --> 40:30.471
Kensi, why all of a sudden
does it sound

40:30.515 --> 40:31.646
like you lived
a hard life

40:31.690 --> 40:33.213
of menthols
and disappointment?

40:33.256 --> 40:35.215
WOMAN:
Save it for my eulogy.

40:35.258 --> 40:36.825
Oh, my God. Mama!

40:37.870 --> 40:39.828
Your father made a mean Sazerac.

40:39.872 --> 40:41.613
He also made a mean drunk.

40:41.656 --> 40:43.702
But I'm not here
for family therapy.

40:43.745 --> 40:45.791
So why are you here, exactly?

40:45.834 --> 40:48.184
I heard there was a job opening.

40:49.098 --> 40:50.883
I thought you were retired.

40:50.926 --> 40:52.101
I got bored.

40:52.145 --> 40:53.886
So pick up golf.

40:53.929 --> 40:55.714
You know I look terrible
in plaid.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.193
You do.Honey,

40:57.237 --> 40:59.152
I'm going stir-crazy at home.

40:59.195 --> 41:01.328
Guy used to
entertain me and...

41:01.371 --> 41:03.286
boy, did he entertain me.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.158
Gross.But there came

41:05.201 --> 41:07.508
a time when I taught him
everything I could,

41:07.552 --> 41:10.990
and I had to let that
baby bird fly free.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.165
Please stop talking.

41:12.208 --> 41:13.558
KENSI:
Okay, you know what?

41:13.601 --> 41:14.994
You've been looking
for somebody who could talk

41:15.037 --> 41:17.170
to just about anybody, right?Yeah, but...

41:17.213 --> 41:20.521
And I DVR The
Talkevery day.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.131
That doesn't...So I'm completely
caught up

41:22.175 --> 41:24.133
on trending topics
and current events.

41:24.177 --> 41:26.266
KENSI:
But also, also,

41:26.309 --> 41:28.660
you don't even
need references,
because, you know...

41:28.703 --> 41:30.183
you're them.

41:30.226 --> 41:31.184
Clever.And I'm available

41:31.227 --> 41:32.533
all the time.

41:32.577 --> 41:33.534
And I mean

41:33.578 --> 41:35.928
allthe time.

41:35.971 --> 41:37.538
That's painstakingly obvious
by the ten times

41:37.582 --> 41:39.148
you try to FaceTime me a day.

41:41.150 --> 41:43.413
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

41:43.457 --> 41:44.980
This is
a terrible plan.

41:45.024 --> 41:46.329
Okay.

41:46.373 --> 41:48.157
One week.
No promises.

41:48.201 --> 41:49.855
Trial run.

41:49.898 --> 41:52.510
Aw, that's my boo-boy.Ooh.

41:52.553 --> 41:55.643
I'm not your boo-boy. Stop.Hey. How about if
I start today?

41:55.687 --> 41:57.906
All right Okay. Yeah, that's...

41:57.950 --> 41:59.342
Aah! Mom!

41:59.386 --> 42:01.606
Margarita.
Just double...

42:01.649 --> 42:03.172
double margarita, please.

42:03.216 --> 42:05.348
Aw, honey.
All that sugar?

42:05.392 --> 42:07.742
Not before the wedding.

42:07.786 --> 42:09.091
How about a vodka water?

42:09.135 --> 42:10.789
How about
a double vodka rocks?

42:10.832 --> 42:13.008
Well, how about water?

42:13.052 --> 42:15.402
This is already
a terrible plan.

42:16.577 --> 42:19.014
DEEKS:
What could possibly go wrong?
