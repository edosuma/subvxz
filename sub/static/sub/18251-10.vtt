00:02.103 --> 00:04.272
(Keys clattering)

00:08.176 --> 00:11.045
(Muffled music)

00:11.079 --> 00:21.255
(Dance music)

00:21.289 --> 00:23.524
Hi. A gin and tonic.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.958
How you doing?

00:24.992 --> 00:26.694
Hi.
Good?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.829
Yeah.
So, uh,

00:28.862 --> 00:30.531
me and my boy here,

00:30.564 --> 00:33.033
we're just having
a guys' night out

00:33.067 --> 00:35.669
and I've got to tell you
you just ruined it
by being so hot.

00:35.703 --> 00:36.937
(Laughing)

00:36.970 --> 00:38.572
Seriously, you know
what I'm going to do?

00:38.606 --> 00:41.675
Is I'm going to put
you on my to-do list.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.943
Ooh.
Heh...

00:42.976 --> 00:45.679
Have any of those lines
ever worked for you?

00:45.713 --> 00:46.780
Yeah!

00:46.814 --> 00:48.616
Yeah? Okay, not now, so.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.384
You failed. Failed!

00:50.418 --> 00:52.253
All right,
all right, whoa...

00:52.286 --> 00:56.690
(Music)

00:56.724 --> 00:57.958
That was impressive.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.361
Thank you.
Sorry about him, I...

01:00.394 --> 01:02.430
Usually it takes
him a few minutes
to embarrass himself

01:02.463 --> 01:03.897
but you managed
to do it in
record time.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.966
(Laughing)

01:05.999 --> 01:07.535
I'm Bruce, by the way.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.569
Hi, Emma.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.471
Emma! Excited
to meet you.

01:10.504 --> 01:11.639
Where are you from?

01:11.672 --> 01:12.673
Sweden.

01:12.706 --> 01:13.874
Sweden,
like the country?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.609
Yeah. Like the country.

01:15.643 --> 01:16.744
I love Sweden!

01:16.777 --> 01:18.379
Okay. Have you been?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.114
No, I mean, uh...

01:20.148 --> 01:21.849
Yeah, I know where it is.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.451
It's up in Europe, right?

01:23.484 --> 01:24.952
Yeah.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.221
Yeah, I heard a
lot of really good
things about it.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.422
Okay.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.724
I'm sorry.
But here, cheers!

01:30.758 --> 01:32.426
To Sweden!
Yeah.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.794
Wow, you're tall!

01:33.827 --> 01:36.564
Oh no, I'm actually
standing on the
railing here.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.599
Oh. (Laughing)
Yeah...

01:38.632 --> 01:40.601
Not that tall.
No, I mean...

01:40.634 --> 01:41.635
Welcome down!

01:41.669 --> 01:42.936
Average height, but...

01:42.970 --> 01:44.272
I wouldn't say
average, but...

01:44.305 --> 01:45.873
In America...
Okay.

01:45.906 --> 01:49.143
Yeah. We're shorter,
I guess, than you guys.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.312
Do you want to dance?
Um...

01:51.345 --> 01:53.181
Please say yes?
I... yeah.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.416
Okay!
Let's do this.

01:55.449 --> 01:59.187
(Music)

01:59.220 --> 02:00.221
Wow.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.294
Woohoo!

02:06.327 --> 02:09.463
(Music)

02:09.497 --> 02:10.764
Wow, you can
really move!

02:10.798 --> 02:11.999
What?

02:12.032 --> 02:13.301
I said you can
really dance!

02:13.334 --> 02:14.468
(Music)

02:14.502 --> 02:15.836
You can't hear
anything?

02:15.869 --> 02:18.572
I can't hear you,
the music is too loud!

02:18.606 --> 02:19.973
Okay, then I'm going
to have to tell you,

02:20.007 --> 02:22.410
you have the most beautiful
face I've ever seen!

02:22.443 --> 02:24.478
Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce...

02:24.512 --> 02:27.248
Bruce. Bruce. Bruce. Bruce!

02:27.281 --> 02:29.417
What are you doing?
are you serious right now?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.385
We're getting married
tomorrow, okay?

02:31.419 --> 02:33.254
We have a ton of stuff
to do. Come on.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.988
Okay, I know, I'm so sorry.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.590
I just...

02:36.624 --> 02:38.526
(Music)

02:38.559 --> 02:41.462
* We're not living in America

02:41.495 --> 02:44.865
* But we're not sorry

02:44.898 --> 02:46.400
* I knew there was something

02:46.434 --> 02:48.636
* That we never had

02:48.669 --> 02:51.572
* We don't worry

02:51.605 --> 02:54.842
* No, we're not
living in America *

02:54.875 --> 02:58.779
* But we're not sorry, no

02:58.812 --> 03:02.149
* We don't care
about the world today *

03:02.182 --> 03:04.918
* We're not sorry

03:04.952 --> 03:06.787
* For you

03:08.222 --> 03:12.226
* For my baby, baby,
baby, baby *

03:12.260 --> 03:13.761
* Aahh

03:16.997 --> 03:18.232
Bruce:
Honey, I'm home!

03:18.266 --> 03:19.300
Hey.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.968
I think I just won
fiancÃ© of the year.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.470
I ordered the flowers,

03:22.503 --> 03:24.305
I booked
the honeymoon hotel,

03:24.338 --> 03:26.006
picked up my suit,

03:26.039 --> 03:29.176
and I bought all
the rice for people
to throw at us.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.244
Rice?

03:30.278 --> 03:31.612
Yeah, you don't
want rice?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.381
What? No, it's just...

03:33.414 --> 03:35.283
This wedding...

03:35.316 --> 03:36.517
What about
the wedding? It's...

03:36.550 --> 03:37.751
Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts,

03:37.785 --> 03:39.186
it's happening tomorrow!

03:39.219 --> 03:41.589
No, dummy. I mean,
of course I want
to marry you.

03:41.622 --> 03:42.823
I'm just thinking,
you know,

03:42.856 --> 03:45.926
a church and a priest
and some rice and...

03:45.959 --> 03:47.628
It's so very
traditional.

03:47.661 --> 03:48.829
It's a wedding.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.865
Yeah, but this is such
a wedding-y wedding.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.434
I mean, isn't it
a little late
for all of this?

03:53.467 --> 03:54.535
We should have
discussed this earlier.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.103
Well, I'm thinking,
you know...

03:56.136 --> 03:58.272
Maybe we could spice
it up a little.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.507
Are you talking
sex wise?

03:59.540 --> 04:00.941
Because I thought
I was doing really
good lately.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.576
I'm talking
about the wedding.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.345
Check this out.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.646
Like this?

04:07.581 --> 04:11.785
(Recorded music, cheers)

04:11.819 --> 04:12.820
(Snickering)

04:12.853 --> 04:14.254
Fun!

04:14.288 --> 04:15.723
Right?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.391
Fun? Yes.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.960
It's very...
You're serious?
Yeah!

04:19.993 --> 04:21.529
You want us all
to dance down the aisle?

04:21.562 --> 04:23.531
(Video stops)
It's fun, right?

04:23.564 --> 04:25.232
Uh, yeah. It's...

04:25.265 --> 04:27.668
Everyone is involved and
it's something different.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.902
It's not very traditional.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.004
No, it's not at
all traditional.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.073
So, that's...
You got that, yeah.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.375
So?

04:34.408 --> 04:36.143
Yeah. If you want
to do it, that's fine.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.445
You can have this.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.747
Are you sure you
want to do this?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.315
I think it's
a great idea!

04:42.616 --> 04:43.617
Yeah.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.486
I think it's
a terrible idea.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.687
What... why?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.656
You want us all to
dance down the aisle?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.424
Have you ever seen
your father dance?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.560
(Speaking in Swedish)

04:52.593 --> 04:54.595
Honey, if you're nervous
about the wedding,

04:54.628 --> 04:56.564
there are other ways
to cancel it

04:56.597 --> 04:58.766
that don't involve
your father dancing.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.036
I'm not nervous and
I don't want to cancel it.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.805
I just want it to be fun.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.274
We want to dance down
the aisle, right honey?

05:07.307 --> 05:10.110
Yeah, uh, I would dance
to the North Pole for you.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.779
Oh, that's sweet.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.715
The North Pole is
not that far from here.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.950
Anyway, you both know
my thoughts on the matter.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.420
Marriage ruins relationships.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.788
Oh, here we go again.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.656
There's a reason why
the word "gift" in Swedish

05:22.690 --> 05:24.925
means both "marriage"

05:24.958 --> 05:27.528
and "poison".
(Laughing)

05:27.561 --> 05:28.896
Okay, you know,
that's not even true.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.464
My parents have been
married for a long time,

05:30.498 --> 05:31.599
and they seem very happy.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.766
I met your parents, Bruce.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.134
Where are they,
by the way?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.736
I thought they were
supposed to be here?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.270
Emma didn't tell you?
No...

05:37.304 --> 05:39.707
They called and said
their flight was cancelled.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.041
But the wedding
is tomorrow!

05:41.074 --> 05:43.477
(Door bell chiming)
I know. It's awful.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.446
They said they were
going to change flights

05:45.479 --> 05:46.947
or try to find
new flights,

05:46.980 --> 05:48.682
but I don't even know if
they're going to make it.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.818
Maybe we should
cancel it.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.487
Ah, this is Bruce
I was talking about.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.822
He lives here too.
Woman:
Ah...

05:54.855 --> 05:56.390
Hey, Bruce!
It's my place.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.091
How's it going?
Hi, I'm Cecilia.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.760
Hello, nice
to meet you!

05:59.793 --> 06:01.629
Gustaf, take this off.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.963
Cecilia is my
girlfriend.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.065
What? Wow!

06:05.098 --> 06:06.600
And your shoe...

06:06.634 --> 06:08.869
Like, a girl
who's my friend,
(Grunting, straining)

06:08.902 --> 06:11.004
but more.
The other shoe.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.706
But I get it, yeah.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.508
Much more.
Heh, heh...

06:14.542 --> 06:17.778
Like, we have sex,
like, lots of sex...

06:17.811 --> 06:19.312
Yeah, I got it
the first time,

06:19.346 --> 06:20.748
you don't need to...

06:20.781 --> 06:23.050
Um...
Cecilia:
(Moaning)

06:23.083 --> 06:24.685
Uh, you know what,
it seems like you guys

06:24.718 --> 06:26.920
have a really nice
connection there.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.489
You know what,
can you guys
just come in?

06:28.522 --> 06:30.057
Before you...
Yeah.
(Laugh)

06:30.090 --> 06:31.659
Nobody needs
to see that.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.663
Bruce:
Ah, okay! Everyone,
here's the big news.

06:35.696 --> 06:39.199
This is Cecilia,
Gustaf's girlfriend.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.904
Uh, Gustaf, Gustaf.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.739
Maybe you should
wash your hands.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.875
You should always wash
your hands before a meal.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.577
I'll come with you and
see that you make it right.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.613
Of course,
how stupid of me.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.881
(Chuckling)

06:53.914 --> 06:55.282
(Whispering)
She's the best!

06:57.885 --> 06:59.787
(Distant muffled laughter)

06:59.820 --> 07:01.088
What's...

07:01.121 --> 07:02.856
A girlfriend? Do you
think he's paying her?

07:15.536 --> 07:17.538
(Chuckling)

07:56.844 --> 07:58.846
(Moaning)

08:01.314 --> 08:04.351
A girlfriend?
How is that even possible?

08:04.384 --> 08:06.153
Maybe it was love
at first sight.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.921
That doesn't exist, Emma.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.356
And with Gustaf.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.224
Not even I loved him
at first sight.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.193
It took years.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.228
(Distant muffled
moaning, grunting)

08:20.200 --> 08:21.501
Nae...

08:21.535 --> 08:23.537
(Louder moaning)

08:28.075 --> 08:29.442
Maybe we should go to
the church to rehearse?

08:29.476 --> 08:31.478
(Mixed agreements)

08:31.511 --> 08:35.115
(Music)

08:35.148 --> 08:37.618
* All I want is your love

08:37.651 --> 08:47.360
(Music)

08:47.394 --> 08:48.696
Woman:
Whoo!

08:48.729 --> 08:51.098
(Music)

08:51.131 --> 08:53.567
* All I want is your love

08:53.601 --> 09:00.207
(Music)

09:00.240 --> 09:02.242
(Mixed cheers)

09:04.578 --> 09:07.247
Yeah!

09:07.280 --> 09:09.416
* All I want is your love

09:09.449 --> 09:19.627
(Music)

09:19.660 --> 09:20.828
Eh...

09:23.363 --> 09:25.532
* All I want is your love

09:25.565 --> 09:32.840
(Music)

09:32.873 --> 09:33.974
(Snickering)

09:34.007 --> 09:36.910
(Music)

09:36.944 --> 09:38.612
Well, someone has
to say something.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.113
About what?

09:40.147 --> 09:44.017
About the fact that
she danced down the
aisle like a stripper.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.954
Not even a good stripper,
like a slutty stripper!

09:46.987 --> 09:49.056
I have to admit
it was quite shocking.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.058
Did you know she
danced like that?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.060
Well, I mean,
I knew she danced sexy

09:53.093 --> 09:55.128
but I thought it was just
when it was the two of us
dancing alone together.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.397
I-I don't want
to see that again.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.132
As a father, I feel dirty.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.102
Well, maybe we should
just cancel the wedding?

10:02.135 --> 10:05.205
No. Nice try, but no.
Okay, then
I'll tell her.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.606
No, no, no.
I'll tell her, okay?

10:06.640 --> 10:09.242
(Squealing)
That was so much
fun, right?

10:09.276 --> 10:13.046
Yes! That was!
Honey, we need
to talk about your bit,

10:13.080 --> 10:14.614
because you were
really stiff,

10:14.648 --> 10:16.316
but, otherwise
everyone else!

10:16.349 --> 10:17.550
Terrific, right?

10:17.584 --> 10:19.052
Bruce:
Yeah, you know, we were...

10:19.086 --> 10:20.654
I knew it!

10:20.688 --> 10:22.589
This felt nothing like
a traditional wedding.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.157
Yes, yes. You're
right about that.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.426
Very untraditional.

10:28.762 --> 10:32.499
(Music)

10:32.532 --> 10:33.667
(Singsong)
There she is!

10:33.701 --> 10:36.503
Good morning!
(Laughing)

10:36.536 --> 10:38.471
Today is the day!

10:38.505 --> 10:41.709
The future
Mrs. Evans-Wiik.
Or Wiik-Evans?

10:41.742 --> 10:44.678
That sounds
better, right?

10:44.712 --> 10:46.413
Honey, we should
talk a little bit
about the dance.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.315
What about the dance?
It's...

10:48.348 --> 10:50.751
nice, it's good so far,
I think, um...

10:50.784 --> 10:52.152
But the choreography
I think maybe

10:52.185 --> 10:53.186
we should look
a little bit at...

10:53.220 --> 10:54.922
What's wrong with
the choreography?

10:54.955 --> 10:56.656
Nothing wrong
with it, at all,

10:56.690 --> 10:59.259
it's just that...
the end part,

10:59.292 --> 11:00.828
I thought maybe
we could...

11:00.861 --> 11:02.395
What is wrong with you?
I'm fine,

11:02.429 --> 11:05.365
I'm just feeling
a little sick,
but I'm fine.
Okay.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.901
Probably just
pre-wedding jitters.
No! God no.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.102
I mean, I was...

11:09.136 --> 11:11.571
I felt worse yesterday,
so I went to the doctor

11:11.604 --> 11:13.440
and everything's fine.
You went to the doctor?

11:13.473 --> 11:15.375
Yeah!
What did he say?

11:15.408 --> 11:18.145
Honey, he ran some tests
and everything is fine.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.546
Okay?
Well we've got
to get going.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.982
I mean, this is a big day,
(Chuckling)
Mmm!

11:22.015 --> 11:23.884
And I don't want to
see you in your dress.

11:23.917 --> 11:27.520
So you're getting ready
at your mother's, right?
Yeah, yeah. I am.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.857
Great.
So, what's the latest
on your parents?

11:29.890 --> 11:32.125
I don't even want
to talk about that,
it's stressing me out.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.394
They said that the flight
might not make it in time

11:34.427 --> 11:36.496
and that they're going
to meet us at the church...

11:36.529 --> 11:38.365
We shouldn't let it
ruin our day.
(Chuckling)

11:38.398 --> 11:40.801
No, because this
is such a big day.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.903
It's like what we
always dreamed of.

11:42.936 --> 11:43.937
It is?
God I can't wait.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.339
Yeah, oh, me too.

11:46.373 --> 11:53.947
(Music)

13:22.970 --> 13:23.971
(Vomiting)

13:26.439 --> 13:31.811
(Music)

13:31.845 --> 13:33.246
We'll be starting
in five minutes

13:33.280 --> 13:34.814
and I'm soon going
to let the guests in.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.084
Okay, this is happening.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.651
DJ, you're ready?

13:38.685 --> 13:40.954
Okay, this has gone
on far too long.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.390
I'm going
to tell her. Yes.
Bruce:
No, no...

13:43.423 --> 13:45.058
I'll do it.
He can do it.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.428
(Rapid tapping)

13:48.461 --> 13:49.462
Emma...

13:54.667 --> 13:56.836
Gustaf:
Birger:

13:56.870 --> 13:58.872
Birger:
Viveka:

14:00.107 --> 14:02.642
Wait, what's going on?

14:02.675 --> 14:04.978
Do you guys...
not want to dance, or what?

14:05.012 --> 14:06.279
No... No, no, no.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.917
We, um, we just...

14:09.950 --> 14:12.185
thought that your part...
maybe we should,

14:12.219 --> 14:14.988
we could take it
down a notch.
What are you talking about?

14:15.022 --> 14:16.990
Viveka:
I can't take it any longer,
I have to say it!

14:17.024 --> 14:20.627
You dance too sexy.
It's horrible!
(Laugh)

14:20.660 --> 14:22.729
Phew! I feel
much better.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.231
That's... I mean,

14:24.264 --> 14:26.099
that's how...
young people dance.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.534
It's called
modern dance.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.836
And also, this church is
not a traditional church

14:29.869 --> 14:31.771
so we can do
whatever we want to.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.440
And luckily
we have a priest

14:33.473 --> 14:35.775
who's cool
and progressive,

14:35.808 --> 14:38.611
and not a total
prude, right?

14:38.645 --> 14:41.748
Actually, um,
if I'm being honest

14:41.781 --> 14:43.650
I think your dancing
might be, uh...

14:43.683 --> 14:45.185
a little much.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.859
I can't believe I'm
hearing this right now.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.893
Bruce:
No, it's... um...

15:18.651 --> 15:20.653
(Cellphone ringing)

15:23.856 --> 15:25.158
Hey!

15:25.192 --> 15:26.693
Wayne:
Hey, son, it's your father.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.761
Yeah, I know, where are
you guys? The wedding
is about to start.

15:28.795 --> 15:32.432
I'm sorry son, but we
couldn't get a flight.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.234
What?
Yeah,

15:34.267 --> 15:36.769
I-I just don't think
we're going to make it.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.539
At all? I mean...

15:39.572 --> 15:42.742
the wedding's about to start!
Where are you guys?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.178
Both:
Surprise!
(Frustrated groan)

15:45.212 --> 15:46.913
Look at the look
on his face!

15:46.946 --> 15:48.648
That is not cool,
you guys!

15:48.681 --> 15:50.917
Told you he'd be
happy to see us!
I know.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.554
It was your father's idea.
You know how funny he is.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.656
Oh, our baby!

15:56.689 --> 15:59.259
Plus now we get
to dance down
the aisles!

15:59.292 --> 16:01.694
We heard all about it,
Viveka told us!
Yeah.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.963
So we've been
practicing our moves.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.865
Show him, honey!
(Laughing)

16:05.898 --> 16:08.301
Oh my God...
It's good, right?
No!

16:08.335 --> 16:10.570
The dancing is done,
we don't need
any more dancing.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.505
But we do have seats
for you guys in front.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.141
Okay.
Okay.
And uh...

16:14.174 --> 16:15.942
no more dancing, okay?
You look good. Aww!

16:15.975 --> 16:17.844
Yeah, thank you.
Those look like
prom shoes.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.579
Pants are
a little snug, honey.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.614
Don't forget
to say "I do".

16:21.648 --> 16:22.949
I'm going to cry,

16:22.982 --> 16:24.417
so don't be
distracted by that.
Okay,

16:24.451 --> 16:26.119
what's wrong
with the shoes?
Lots of crying.

16:28.888 --> 16:32.025
(Music)

16:32.059 --> 16:33.526
Bruce:
Babe, come back inside!

16:33.560 --> 16:35.262
How could you not tell
me you felt this way?

16:35.295 --> 16:38.231
It's not a big deal,
okay? You just danced
a little sexy.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.733
This is not sexy,
this is modern dance.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.769
Okay. Is this just
some sort of weird
last minute attempt

16:42.802 --> 16:44.971
not to get married?
I do want to marry you.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.240
I wanted to marry you since
the first time I met you,

16:47.274 --> 16:49.309
when you pretended
to know where Sweden was.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.145
Okay, good because
I want to marry you too!
Really badly!

16:52.179 --> 16:54.547
And, I mean, there's,
like, a million reasons
why we shouldn't be together

16:54.581 --> 16:57.117
and a million reasons
why this wedding shouldn't
be happening, but it is

16:57.150 --> 16:59.052
and this is because it's
supposed to be, okay?

16:59.086 --> 17:00.953
I want to be
with you every day.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.822
I want to walk down
the street with you and
have people be, like,

17:02.855 --> 17:05.658
"Hey, why is that super hot
girl with this schmo?"

17:05.692 --> 17:08.395
Aww, you're not a schmo.
Wait, what's a schmo?

17:08.428 --> 17:10.263
It's a schmuck.
Oh, what's a schmuck?

17:10.297 --> 17:11.898
It doesn't matter, okay?
Okay,

17:11.931 --> 17:13.066
but this is not
about the wedding.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.135
This is about... the dance.

17:15.168 --> 17:17.036
I don't know...
I'm not sure
I want to do it.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.971
Okay, so we won't
do it, then.
Okay.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.208
Yeah, it's no problem.
I'll just tell the DJ
not to play the song.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.076
Okay... Oh, no.
Oh God.
(Muffled music from inside)

17:23.110 --> 17:25.078
Ahh...
Okay, listen,
listen, honey,

17:25.112 --> 17:27.480
Your mom was
wrong, okay?
Mm-hmm.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.216
Marriages don't
ruin relationships,

17:29.249 --> 17:30.783
they make them
stronger, okay?
Okay.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.385
So we're going to
do this together.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.254
We're going to dance
sexy together.
Not sexy, modern.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.988
Not sexy, modern, yes.

17:36.022 --> 17:38.425
Modernly, we'll dance
modernly together,

17:38.458 --> 17:39.859
and just...
I don't know,

17:39.892 --> 17:41.728
I'm just...
(Sigh)
Trust me, okay?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.763
Just follow
my lead, okay?

17:45.132 --> 17:47.367
Okay.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.402
Okay.
(Deep breath)

17:51.771 --> 17:54.474
* All I want is your love
(Mixed chatter)

17:54.507 --> 17:56.509
(Mixed cheers)
(Rhythmic clapping)

17:59.045 --> 18:01.047
(Mixed shouts)

18:04.517 --> 18:06.586
(Clapping fades)

18:06.619 --> 18:17.197
(Music)

18:17.230 --> 18:19.266
(Thuds)

18:19.299 --> 18:20.300
Yeah!

18:20.333 --> 18:21.834
(Wood creaking)

18:21.868 --> 18:27.474
(Music)

18:27.507 --> 18:30.109
He didn't get the moves
from you, that's for sure.

18:30.143 --> 18:35.748
(Music)

18:35.782 --> 18:37.817
(Oohs and ahhs, whistling)

18:37.850 --> 18:43.089
(Music)

18:43.122 --> 18:45.158
Various:
Aww!

18:45.192 --> 18:57.404
(Music)

18:57.437 --> 19:00.173
She looks kind of slutty.
Oh, I'm so bored.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.908
I'm just saying,
I don't think
it's appropriate,

19:01.941 --> 19:04.344
that's all.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.946
Honey, what happened
to the modern dance?
You were right,

19:06.979 --> 19:09.048
it looked too sexy.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.351
But thank you, though.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.920
Actually, we're
not at that part
of the ceremony yet.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.722
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.857
(Clearing throat)
(Exhaling)

19:23.263 --> 19:24.631
Do you, Bruce,

19:24.664 --> 19:27.934
promise to do your best
to try and love Emma

19:27.967 --> 19:29.836
till death do you part

19:29.869 --> 19:33.306
I...
or until some other
unforeseen event occurs?

19:35.775 --> 19:37.143
I do.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.379
Oh, come on!
Priest:
And, do you, Emma...

19:39.412 --> 19:41.814
Can you believe this?
This is not going to last.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.951
...promise to do your best
to try and love Bruce

19:44.984 --> 19:47.053
without sacrificing
your independence

19:47.086 --> 19:49.356
or individuality in any way?

19:49.389 --> 19:50.390
(Chuckling,
speaking Swedish)

19:52.024 --> 19:53.526
Honey!

19:53.560 --> 19:54.827
I said yes.
Did she say yes?

19:54.861 --> 19:57.029
I now pronounce you

19:57.063 --> 19:59.098
husband and wife!

19:59.131 --> 20:01.601
And now you can
kiss each other.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.736
(Funky music)

20:03.770 --> 20:05.772
(Cheering, applause)

20:10.076 --> 20:11.778
And ladies and gentlemen,

20:11.811 --> 20:13.513
I present to you

20:13.546 --> 20:17.884
Mr. and Mrs. Wiik-Evans!

20:17.917 --> 20:20.487
Yay!
Actually it's
Evans-Wiik.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.922
Oh, keep going,
keep going.
It's Evans-Wiik.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.557
Evans-Wiik.

20:24.591 --> 20:35.001
(Music)

20:35.034 --> 20:40.172
(Music)

20:40.206 --> 20:50.650
(Music)

20:50.683 --> 20:55.655
(Music)

20:58.157 --> 21:01.661
(Applause)

21:01.694 --> 21:03.763
Bruce:
(Humming)

21:03.796 --> 21:06.366
Little champagne
for the newlyweds!

21:06.399 --> 21:08.968
We did it!
We did it, honey!

21:09.001 --> 21:10.370
Yes!
(Cellphone ringing)

21:10.403 --> 21:11.638
Can you answer my phone?

21:11.671 --> 21:13.673
(Cellphone ringing)

21:17.877 --> 21:19.612
This is Mrs. Evans' phone.

21:19.646 --> 21:22.181
Wiik-Evans!
Wi...Wiik-Evans...

21:22.214 --> 21:23.850
(Sighing)

21:23.883 --> 21:26.986
Uh, she is here,
but, uh, she's busy.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.221
We are just married.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.491
Newlyweds!
(Chuckling)

21:31.524 --> 21:32.525
Yes.
(In Swedish)

21:48.040 --> 21:49.576
Who was it?
I don't know,

21:49.609 --> 21:50.977
they insisted upon
speaking Swedish.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.512
I think it was from
your doctor's office.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.080
Are you good
friends with them?

21:54.113 --> 21:55.782
Because they were really
happy about this wedding.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.216
Okay?
They were like...

22:01.654 --> 22:03.523
I'm pregnant?
What?
