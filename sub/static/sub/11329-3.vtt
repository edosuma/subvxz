00:02.896 --> 00:06.031
Adrian's not pregnant.
I saw the results,
and they were wrong.

00:06.032 --> 00:08.467
The tests are accurate.
Well, maybe Adrian
read it wrong.

00:08.468 --> 00:10.436
Maybe she's not pregnant
because she had an abortion.

00:10.437 --> 00:12.638
I told her not to do that,
and I don't think
she would do that.

00:12.639 --> 00:14.340
If my parents think
I have a place to live,

00:14.341 --> 00:16.775
then my dad can accept the job,
and they'll take off.

00:16.776 --> 00:18.143
Where are you
really gonna stay?

00:18.144 --> 00:19.478
I don't know.
I'll find someplace.

00:19.479 --> 00:22.481
You, Amy Juergens,
have been invited to attend

00:22.482 --> 00:25.918
a four-week, all-expenses paid
program for young musicians

00:25.919 --> 00:27.386
this summer in New York.

00:27.387 --> 00:29.221
Congratulations
on getting the offer,

00:29.222 --> 00:31.590
and my condolences on not
being able to accept.

00:31.591 --> 00:33.325
If people find out
that I was pregnant,

00:33.326 --> 00:35.628
or later,
find out that I had an abortion,

00:35.629 --> 00:37.062
I can live with that.

00:37.063 --> 00:40.299
I'm gonna tell my mother.
My mother will go with me.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.134
Ben, Adrian is pregnant.

00:42.135 --> 00:45.137
- No, she's not.
- Yes, she is.

00:45.138 --> 00:47.106
And if she told you she isn't,
she lied.

00:47.107 --> 00:49.108
I got accepted
into a summer program

00:49.109 --> 00:51.610
at the Nomkomf School
of Music in New York.
You should go.

00:51.611 --> 00:54.046
Ben, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

00:54.047 --> 00:56.649
I'm your dad.
I love you.

00:56.650 --> 00:59.785
Adrian's pregnant,
and it's my baby.

01:14.701 --> 01:17.102
Wow.

01:17.103 --> 01:20.639
It's really getting
kind of late.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.008
Why don't you two
get some sleep?

01:25.045 --> 01:26.578
Ben, you didn't even
touch your dinner.

01:26.579 --> 01:28.580
You want me to make you
a sandwich or something?

01:28.581 --> 01:31.417
Thank you, Betty, but,
uh, I'm still not hungry.

01:33.053 --> 01:35.821
Well, all right, then.

01:35.822 --> 01:37.856
How about everybody
just says good night?

01:37.857 --> 01:40.726
Good night.
Good night.

01:40.727 --> 01:44.563
Leo, come on, honey.

01:44.564 --> 01:46.932
It's not so bad.
I mean, there are worse problems

01:46.933 --> 01:49.968
than-- than Ben and Adrian.

01:49.969 --> 01:52.738
I mean, it's all gonna
work itself out.

01:52.739 --> 01:55.441
You'll see.

01:55.442 --> 01:57.976
All right. Well,
I'm gonna say good night.

02:00.046 --> 02:02.047
Good night.

02:02.048 --> 02:05.884
And I just wanna say
that I love you both,

02:05.885 --> 02:09.488
and I don't want
either of you to say,
"I love you, too, Betty,"

02:09.489 --> 02:11.323
because if you love me,

02:11.324 --> 02:13.592
you would take my advice
and you would sleep on it.

02:17.364 --> 02:19.098
Good night.

02:28.775 --> 02:30.709
I remember when
I said that to George

02:30.710 --> 02:32.311
when you and Amy
wanted to get married.

02:34.547 --> 02:36.215
I told them
there were worse problems

02:36.216 --> 02:37.883
than two teenagers
getting married

02:37.884 --> 02:40.352
and having a baby.

02:40.353 --> 02:42.688
I'm glad Betty
reminded me of that.

02:42.689 --> 02:45.657
There are worse problems.

02:45.658 --> 02:47.893
You're not sick.
I'm not sick.

02:47.894 --> 02:49.895
Betty's not sick.

02:49.896 --> 02:53.065
No one's sick.
You're not on drugs.

02:53.066 --> 02:54.733
You don't have a problem
with alcohol.

02:54.734 --> 02:56.902
You're not flunking
out of school.

02:56.903 --> 02:59.705
You didn't wreck the car
and get hurt
or hurt someone else.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.976
Business is good.
The company's doing well.

03:05.945 --> 03:09.314
And I have a lovely bride
upstairs who's waiting for me.

03:09.315 --> 03:12.050
And I do love her.

03:12.051 --> 03:15.120
So let's take Betty's advice
and sleep on this.

03:19.192 --> 03:21.894
[sighs]
And tomorrow,
you talk to Adrian.

03:21.895 --> 03:24.129
About what?
Dad, I already told you.

03:24.130 --> 03:26.231
She doesn't want me to know.
But you do know.

03:26.232 --> 03:28.000
I do, but I don't.

03:28.001 --> 03:29.835
No. You do,
but you don't want to.

03:29.836 --> 03:31.236
No, I don't.

03:31.237 --> 03:33.639
And that's Adrian's decision
for me not to know.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.975
And whatever she decides
to do about...this

03:36.976 --> 03:38.477
is her decision.

03:38.478 --> 03:40.412
And that way,
you don't have to be involved.

03:40.413 --> 03:41.747
I know that's what
you're thinking.

03:41.748 --> 03:42.981
I admitted
that's what I'm thinking.

03:42.982 --> 03:44.183
I don't wanna be involved.

03:44.184 --> 03:46.819
And what happens if Adrian
decides to have the baby?

03:46.820 --> 03:49.254
You gonna get involved then?
She's not going to do that.

03:49.255 --> 03:51.290
You never know, son.
What if she does?

03:51.291 --> 03:52.925
She won't.
She might.

03:52.926 --> 03:55.093
So do like I told you
and talk to her tomorrow.

03:56.496 --> 03:58.163
And keep talking to her.

03:58.164 --> 04:01.834
And keep talking to me,
and I'll keep talking to you.

04:01.835 --> 04:04.870
I love you, Ben,
and I feel for you and Adrian,

04:04.871 --> 04:05.804
but...

04:08.041 --> 04:09.441
I'm not gonna say it.

04:09.442 --> 04:11.176
You mean you're not
gonna say it again.

04:11.177 --> 04:14.413
You're just as responsible
as Adrian is for what happened.

04:14.414 --> 04:17.082
I may be just as responsible
as Adrian for what happened,

04:17.083 --> 04:19.418
but what she does
about what happened
is up to her.

04:19.418 --> 04:21.053
And you're gonna go
running off to Amy

04:21.053 --> 04:23.288
and leave Adrian
to hdle this all by herself

04:23.289 --> 04:25.057
because you're not
supposed to know anything?

04:25.058 --> 04:26.225
Yep.

04:26.226 --> 04:28.894
Are you gonna let Amy
find out from someone else?

04:28.895 --> 04:30.629
Are you?
Are you gonna tell her?

04:30.630 --> 04:32.331
I don't know
if she has to find out.

04:32.332 --> 04:34.833
I mean,
you wouldn't have found out
if I hadn't told you.

04:34.834 --> 04:37.069
What do you want from me?
I want you to tell Amy,

04:37.070 --> 04:38.904
and I want you to be
as kind to Adrian

04:38.905 --> 04:41.073
as you were to Amy
when she was in this situation.

04:41.074 --> 04:43.075
That's what I want.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:43.076 --> 04:44.910
You don't want me to be
so kind to Adrian

04:44.911 --> 04:47.546
as to offer to marry her
like I did Amy, do you?

04:47.547 --> 04:49.748
I mean, you can't
possibly think that.

04:49.749 --> 04:52.217
Yeah, well,
maybe I do think that.

04:52.218 --> 04:53.886
Good night.

04:54.988 --> 04:57.055
This can't be happening.

04:58.157 --> 04:59.658
[chuckles]

05:02.495 --> 05:04.863
 Falling in love 

05:04.864 --> 05:08.033
Is such an easy thing to do

05:08.034 --> 05:10.969
 Birds can do it We can do it

05:10.970 --> 05:15.374
 Let's stop talking Let's get to it,
Let's fall in love...

05:45.153 --> 05:47.488
Hey. It's late.
You should be in bed.

05:47.489 --> 05:48.589
I know.

05:48.590 --> 05:49.790
Did you call
to say good night?

05:49.791 --> 05:51.592
Yeah. Kind of.

05:51.593 --> 05:53.060
Is everything okay?

05:53.061 --> 05:54.595
Of course everything is okay.

05:54.596 --> 05:55.963
I'm just anxious for you
to get home.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.131
Because?

05:57.132 --> 06:00.701
Because my mom and my dad
are married now,

06:00.702 --> 06:03.504
and the three of us
have yet to be together
at the same time in our house.

06:03.505 --> 06:04.939
Yeah. And?

06:04.940 --> 06:07.742
And so I'm just
checking to see

06:07.743 --> 06:09.643
if you're coming home
tomorrow night.

06:09.644 --> 06:11.612
Definitely coming home
tomorrow night.

06:11.613 --> 06:13.781
I'm definitely coming home
tomorrow night.

06:13.782 --> 06:15.516
What time? Maybe I can
make dinner for all of us.

06:15.517 --> 06:18.486
Uh, a home-cooked meal
with you and Ruben sounds great.

06:18.487 --> 06:20.388
But I'm flying
in around 11:30,

06:20.389 --> 06:22.123
so I won't be there
until after midnight.

06:22.124 --> 06:23.824
After midnight, huh?

06:23.825 --> 06:25.893
Yeah. But we can all
have breakfast together

06:25.894 --> 06:27.561
the next morning,
before you go to school.

06:27.562 --> 06:28.996
Yeah, I guess.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.531
Are you sure
everything's okay?

06:30.532 --> 06:32.166
Yeah.

06:32.167 --> 06:33.701
You didn't sleep
with Ben again, did you?

06:33.702 --> 06:35.536
No, I'm never sleeping
with Ben again.

06:35.537 --> 06:38.038
Okay.

06:38.039 --> 06:40.141
Ricky?
Did you go back with Ricky?

06:40.142 --> 06:42.476
Did you try
to go back with Ricky?
Is it Ricky?

06:42.477 --> 06:44.545
Mom, really, it's just you.

06:44.546 --> 06:47.748
I miss you, and I'm just
really looking forward
to seeing you, and so is Ruben.

06:47.749 --> 06:51.185
You're sure it's not
something else?

06:51.186 --> 06:54.255
Why do I feel like
there's something else?

06:54.256 --> 06:57.558
[gasps] You're not trying
to tell me he's already
cheating on me, are you?

06:57.559 --> 06:59.560
The first week you're married?

06:59.561 --> 07:02.263
Mom, no.
Ruben wouldn't do that.
He would never do that.

07:02.264 --> 07:03.931
Well, there's something
you're not telling me.

07:03.932 --> 07:06.534
I can tell, Adrian.
Come on. What is it?

07:06.535 --> 07:08.536
I've never heard anyone
so paranoid.

07:08.537 --> 07:11.439
I just love you, okay?
I love you and I miss you,
and so does Dad.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.507
All right.

07:13.508 --> 07:15.810
I love you,
and I miss you, too.

07:15.811 --> 07:16.811
Good night.

07:16.812 --> 07:18.846
Good night, Adrian.

07:20.415 --> 07:22.016
[beeps]

07:23.118 --> 07:24.985
[sighs]

07:46.741 --> 07:49.276
Where are you going
in such a hurry?

07:50.345 --> 07:51.846
Nowhere.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.981
You want me
to help you out there?

07:53.982 --> 07:56.917
No. I can do it.
I'm just making a sandwich.

07:56.918 --> 07:58.986
Well, you had dinner, like,

07:58.987 --> 08:00.921
four hours ago.

08:00.922 --> 08:02.923
Okay, it was four hours ago.

08:02.924 --> 08:05.426
So, I can make you
a sandwich.

08:05.427 --> 08:06.927
Let me make you a sandwich.

08:06.928 --> 08:08.929
I know you can make me
a sandwich.

08:08.930 --> 08:10.498
But it's late.
Go back to bed.

08:13.435 --> 08:15.402
Oh, I get it.

08:15.403 --> 08:18.772
Mom hung up and called you
and told you to run down here
and see if I'm okay.

08:18.773 --> 08:21.075
Yeah. So I did.

08:21.076 --> 08:22.943
I had to.

08:22.944 --> 08:25.412
So, are you okay?

08:25.413 --> 08:26.580
I'm okay.

08:30.619 --> 08:32.186
What are you looking for?

08:32.187 --> 08:35.155
I don't know.
But your mother's sure
that you're not okay.

08:35.155 --> 08:36.590
But I am okay.

08:36.591 --> 08:37.924
All right.

08:37.926 --> 08:40.628
What do you want me to tell her
when I call her back?

08:43.063 --> 08:44.565
Okay.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.866
[beeping]

08:47.969 --> 08:50.471
[ringing]
What did she say?

08:50.472 --> 08:54.174
She said to stop worrying,
she's fine, and she loves
her crazy mama.

08:54.175 --> 08:57.211
All right.
Then you're fine.
And I love you, too.

08:57.212 --> 08:58.679
Good night, again.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.881
Good night again
to you, sweetie.
[kisses]

09:04.853 --> 09:07.121
You don't want some help?
I don't want some help.

09:07.122 --> 09:10.224
All right. Good night.
I love you, Adrian.

09:10.225 --> 09:12.026
I love you, too.

09:20.201 --> 09:21.635

09:40.055 --> 09:41.956
<i>Hello?
What's up?</i>

09:41.957 --> 09:43.891
I've been texting you
for an hour.

09:43.892 --> 09:45.259
So you're still up?

09:45.260 --> 09:47.161
I was sleeping,

09:47.162 --> 09:49.663
but I got hungry and came down
to make a sandwich.

09:49.664 --> 09:51.565
What are you doing up?
Can't sleep.

09:51.566 --> 09:53.233
Why not?
Adrian,

09:53.234 --> 09:55.035
I think we have to talk.

09:55.036 --> 09:57.237
Okay. But not tonight.

09:57.238 --> 09:59.840
Maybe tomorrow
or the next day or whenever.

09:59.841 --> 10:01.508
But at some point,
we'll talk.

10:01.509 --> 10:03.944
"Or whenever"?
Whenever what?

10:03.945 --> 10:06.914
Ben, I asked you
to give me a few days.

10:06.915 --> 10:08.916
I know.

10:08.917 --> 10:10.884
Didn't I see you
over at Amy's tonight?

10:10.885 --> 10:12.853
You and Amy
getting back together.

10:12.854 --> 10:14.888
That's a good thing, right?
You and Amy?

10:14.889 --> 10:16.156
Yeah.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.158
So just leave things
like they are, Ben.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.228
All right?
Go and be with Amy
and don't even think about me.

10:21.229 --> 10:25.499
So, are you still...pregnant?

10:25.500 --> 10:27.001
Leave it alone, Ben.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.536
Just leave it alone, please.

10:29.537 --> 10:30.771
I can't.

10:30.772 --> 10:32.773
You can.

10:32.774 --> 10:34.274
Did someone say
something to you?

10:34.275 --> 10:36.844
No one said anything to me.
Who would say anything to me?

10:36.845 --> 10:38.178
Ricky.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.847
And it's none of his business.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.149
And it's none of your business.
It's no one's business.

10:43.451 --> 10:46.086
Adrian, I hate
to tell you this,

10:46.087 --> 10:49.223
but I told my dad.

10:49.224 --> 10:50.724
You told me
you wouldn't do that.

10:50.725 --> 10:52.226
You promised me
you wouldn't do that.

10:52.227 --> 10:53.861
You promised me you'd give me
a couple of days.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.362
I couldn't help it.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.864
My dad and I are very close.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.400
I had to tell him, Adrian.
I can't hide this from him.

10:59.401 --> 11:01.502
There's not going to be
anything to hide.

11:01.503 --> 11:03.137
I'm just waiting
until my mother gets back,

11:03.138 --> 11:05.205
and then I'll tell her,
and I'll take care of it.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.440
You sure you wanna do that?

11:06.441 --> 11:08.442
Yeah, I'm sure I don't
wanna have a baby.

11:08.443 --> 11:10.477
And I'm even more sure
you don't wanna have a baby.

11:12.013 --> 11:14.415
So just leave me alone,
all right?

11:14.416 --> 11:17.751
Let me do what I wanna do,
what I have to do.

11:17.752 --> 11:19.420
Good night, Ben.
[beeps]

11:20.722 --> 11:21.922
[beeps]

11:24.125 --> 11:25.526
[beeping]

11:27.796 --> 11:30.798
<i>[beeps]
Hold on a second.</i>

11:30.799 --> 11:33.367
[sighs]
How'd I know who it is?

11:33.368 --> 11:35.703
Well, who else would it be?
It's Adrian.

11:35.704 --> 11:37.705
Yeah. All right.
I don't care if it's Adrian.

11:37.706 --> 11:39.707
Well, you cared enough to go
over to her house today.

11:39.708 --> 11:43.110
I wanted her to tell me.
I wanted to hear it from her.

11:43.111 --> 11:45.412
I wanted to see
the look on her face
so I'd know it's true.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.081
<i>Why?
Why?</i>

11:47.082 --> 11:48.415
Yeah. Why?

11:48.416 --> 11:50.017
Why do you wanna
know the truth?

11:50.018 --> 11:51.685
It's not your baby.

11:51.686 --> 11:54.054
She's not pregnant
with your baby,
so why do you wanna know?

11:54.055 --> 11:55.422
Because I think
Ben should know.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.623
Oh, come on. He knows.

11:56.624 --> 11:57.958
He's just pretending
not to know.

11:57.959 --> 11:59.626
He's not exactly pretending.

11:59.627 --> 12:01.895
It's more like insisting
on not knowing.

12:01.896 --> 12:03.564
I tried to talk
to him about it.

12:03.565 --> 12:05.299
He doesn't wanna hear it.
He doesn't wanna know.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.368
Yeah. He and Adrian have agreed
that he shouldn't know anything.

12:08.369 --> 12:10.571
So why are you getting
in the middle of their business?

12:10.572 --> 12:12.906
Because Ben's my friend,
because I've been through this,

12:12.907 --> 12:15.175
and because I think
he should know,

12:15.176 --> 12:17.411
and he should be responsible
for whatever happens, too.

12:17.412 --> 12:19.446
Well, isn't he really
better off not knowing?

12:19.447 --> 12:22.382
What guy's better off
not knowing, huh?
Tell me that.

12:22.383 --> 12:24.985
Ben. That's who's
better off not knowing.

12:24.986 --> 12:26.987
And that's what he and Adrian
have agreed to,

12:26.988 --> 12:29.456
so why don't you
just leave it alone?

12:29.457 --> 12:31.558
[sighs]
Jeez, you need to get a hobby,

12:31.559 --> 12:36.029
or go back to having stupid
indiscriminate sex or something.

12:36.030 --> 12:38.999
This isn't like you--
getting into
everyone's business.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.802
What-- I'm not in
everyone's business.
This is my business.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.904
No, it's not.
But you know what is?

12:43.905 --> 12:45.839
Amy and John.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.076
And if Amy wants to go
to a music program in New York
for four weeks,

12:49.077 --> 12:50.944
you should encourage her
to do that.

12:50.945 --> 12:53.380
You should do whatever
you have to do and say
whatever you have to say

12:53.381 --> 12:54.782
to get her to go away
this summer.

12:54.783 --> 12:57.718
Why? So she won't find out?
She'll find out.

12:57.719 --> 13:00.187
Someone will tell her.
That's why Ben should tell her.

13:00.188 --> 13:02.756
And how's he gonna do that
if he doesn't admit
that he knows?

13:02.757 --> 13:04.191
She doesn't
have to find out.

13:04.192 --> 13:07.261
Come on, Ashley.
She's gonna find out.
She is.

13:07.262 --> 13:09.496
You're not gonna tell her.
No, I'm not.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.299
But believe me, someone will,
and it should be Ben.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.134
No, it should be Adrian,

13:14.135 --> 13:15.869
and only if Adrian
wants her to know.

13:15.870 --> 13:18.705
And she doesn't want her
or anyone else to know,

13:18.706 --> 13:21.375
so why don't you
just leave it alone?

13:21.376 --> 13:23.310
Please, just leave it alone.

13:23.311 --> 13:26.079
Good night.
[beeps]

13:38.125 --> 13:40.393
I have a job interview
tomorrow.

13:40.394 --> 13:42.061
I asked Amy
to drop Robbie off

13:42.062 --> 13:43.729
at the church nursery
with John.

13:43.730 --> 13:45.765
What?
What part of that
do you want me to repeat?

13:45.766 --> 13:47.867
You're just gonna pawn
our son off
at the church nursery

13:47.868 --> 13:49.235
so you can go look
for a job you don't need?

13:49.236 --> 13:51.070
I'm paying the nursery.

13:51.071 --> 13:52.972
It's not like I asked them
to watch Robbie for free.

13:52.973 --> 13:55.041
My son is not staying
at the church nursery.

13:55.042 --> 13:58.144
We're not Amy and Ricky.
We're adults. We can
take care of our own baby.

13:58.145 --> 14:00.313
You have to work,
and I need to find work.

14:00.314 --> 14:02.782
Why? I'm happy to share
whatever I have with you.

14:02.783 --> 14:04.116
Don't I share
whatever I have with you?

14:04.117 --> 14:05.618
And don't I share
the house with you?

14:05.619 --> 14:07.119
It's my house.
I got it in the settlement.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.821
Yeah, and it's my store
and my money,

14:08.822 --> 14:11.624
and I got that
in the settlement, but I
never point that out to you.

14:11.625 --> 14:13.125
I just keep money
in both bank accounts

14:13.126 --> 14:14.961
just like I did when there
was only one bank account.

14:14.962 --> 14:17.697
Yes, you do, and that's why
I don't ask you to pay rent.

14:17.698 --> 14:19.198
But I would just feel
more comfortable

14:19.199 --> 14:22.101
earning my own money
than taking money from you.

14:22.102 --> 14:24.036
[clang, distant]

14:29.409 --> 14:30.509
[whining]

14:33.547 --> 14:36.048
The baby's sleeping.
What are you doing up so late?

14:36.049 --> 14:38.050
It's 1:00 in the morning.
Why are you up so late?

14:38.051 --> 14:39.819
I-I'm studying.

14:39.820 --> 14:42.521
You are?
I cannot tell a lie.

14:42.522 --> 14:44.056
Since when?

14:44.057 --> 14:46.659
I can't sleep.
I'm worried about Amy.

14:46.660 --> 14:47.960
[both]
Why?

14:47.961 --> 14:49.762
Well, she really
wants to go

14:49.763 --> 14:51.831
to this summer music program
in New York.

14:51.832 --> 14:53.566
What summer music program
in New York?

14:53.567 --> 14:55.134
Yeah, what program?
Why didn't she tell us?

14:55.135 --> 14:58.237
I don't know,
but I thought I should tell you.

14:58.238 --> 15:01.474
I told her she should go,
but she said she can't
because of John.

15:01.475 --> 15:04.143
Well, what kind of program?
The kind of program
where she can't go

15:04.144 --> 15:07.179
because she has a baby,
like all other programs,
any one she wants to go to.

15:07.180 --> 15:09.181
Only Amy has
a full scholarship and housing

15:09.182 --> 15:12.051
if she can take part
in this program with students
from all over the country.

15:12.052 --> 15:14.220
What?
Yeah. It's a huge honor.

15:14.221 --> 15:16.155
Well, then, she has to go.

15:16.156 --> 15:18.090
We have to figure out some way
so she can go.

15:18.091 --> 15:21.093
Yeah, let's send her off to band
camp in New York where there
will be millions of Rickys.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.328
Maybe she'll have
another baby.

15:22.329 --> 15:23.596
She's on the pill, remember?

15:23.597 --> 15:25.564
[sighs]

15:25.565 --> 15:27.366
Anyway, I'll talk to Amy
about it in the morning.

15:27.367 --> 15:28.534
Yeah. So will I.

15:28.535 --> 15:30.269
Well, maybe you and I
should talk about it first.

15:30.270 --> 15:33.673
Maybe we should.
I said we should.

15:33.674 --> 15:36.942
Good night, Ashley.
You need to get some sleep.
You have school in the morning.

15:36.943 --> 15:38.611
Good night, Mom.
Good night.

15:38.612 --> 15:40.146
Oh, and thanks again
for trusting me

15:40.147 --> 15:42.882
to make my own decisions
about school tomorrow
and every day.

15:42.883 --> 15:44.884
Well, I just hope that you
don't find yourself

15:44.885 --> 15:46.852
dealing with
any unpleasant consequences

15:46.853 --> 15:48.854
as a result of making
your own decisions.

15:48.855 --> 15:50.256
Like?

15:50.257 --> 15:53.259
Like getting arrested
for truancy.

15:53.260 --> 15:55.461
But thanks for letting us
know about Amy.

15:55.462 --> 15:58.364
I don't know why Amy
didn't let us know herself.
But thank you.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.501
And just why would
you think your sister

16:02.502 --> 16:04.537
should be away all summer
in New York, of all places?

16:04.538 --> 16:06.472
It's just for four weeks.

16:06.473 --> 16:08.941
And it's a good thing for Amy.

16:08.942 --> 16:11.277
Jeez, excuse me
for being a good sister.

16:15.382 --> 16:16.649
[ice rattles]

16:21.755 --> 16:24.490
Hi. You're home late.
Long day?

16:24.491 --> 16:25.991
Yeah. Very long.

16:25.992 --> 16:28.227
We missed you at dinner.

16:28.228 --> 16:29.428
Complicated delivery.

16:29.429 --> 16:30.930
Everything turn out okay?

16:30.931 --> 16:32.765
Is the mom okay?
Is the baby okay?

16:32.766 --> 16:34.600
Mother's fine.
Baby's fine.

16:34.601 --> 16:37.937
Dad's a little stressed out.
But, uh, what's going on?

16:37.938 --> 16:39.338
"What's going on?"

16:39.339 --> 16:41.440
You seem-- I don't know--
a little

16:41.441 --> 16:43.275
extra-special friendly,
especially for this late hour.

16:43.276 --> 16:45.244
You noticed?
I did.

16:45.245 --> 16:47.246
[sighs]
All right.

16:47.247 --> 16:51.517
Well, I was just thinking
that maybe

16:51.518 --> 16:54.086
you were right
and I was wrong...about Adrian.

16:54.087 --> 16:55.454
Oh.

16:55.455 --> 16:58.224
And if you are right
about Adrian,

16:58.225 --> 17:00.626
do you know any couples that
are looking to adopt a baby?

17:00.627 --> 17:03.629
Why do you ask?
I wanna offer Adrian my help

17:03.630 --> 17:05.698
by offering her some options.

17:05.699 --> 17:08.968
Real options like names
and phone numbers.

17:08.969 --> 17:12.905
Ah. Yeah. See, that would be
offering Adrian my help.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.273
Did Adrian ask you
to give her some options?

17:15.275 --> 17:18.577
No, but that's only because
she hasn't told me
she's pregnant yet.

17:18.578 --> 17:21.680
I'm her best friend.
She'll ask. I know she will.

17:21.681 --> 17:24.316
I mean, if you're right,
and there really is a baby.

17:24.317 --> 17:26.986
You mean, if there really
is a pregnancy?
Baby.

17:26.987 --> 17:28.319
Why are you making this
your concern?

17:28.320 --> 17:29.688
It is my concern.

17:29.689 --> 17:31.190
I don't want it to be,
but it is.

17:31.191 --> 17:32.425
No, it's not.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.593
Yes, it is.
That's why I can't sleep.

17:34.594 --> 17:36.829
I wanna get to her
right away with some options.

17:36.830 --> 17:40.199
She needs options.
Can I make a suggestion?

17:40.200 --> 17:42.435
Why don't you just focus
on you and your own life?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.970
I don't know what you mean.
[scoffs]

17:44.971 --> 17:48.474
You know what, Grace?
I'm not sure you do know
what I mean.

17:48.475 --> 17:50.843
What I mean is,
why don't you let Adrian
deal with her problems,

17:50.844 --> 17:54.180
and why don't you do just
whatever it is you need to do
to worry about you right now?

17:54.181 --> 17:55.948
Are you all set to go
to med camp this summer?

17:55.949 --> 17:58.984
I was, but now I think
I'm just gonna hang around here
this summer.

17:58.985 --> 18:00.352
I see.

18:00.353 --> 18:02.054
No, you don't.
You don't see.

18:02.055 --> 18:04.223
You don't see that
my best friend is pregnant
and having a baby.

18:04.224 --> 18:06.725
I wanna be there for him-- her.
Him?

18:06.726 --> 18:09.295
Just say what
you wanna say, Jeff.

18:09.296 --> 18:13.199
All right, Grace. Look,
you have what it takes
to become a doctor.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.034
I really believe that.

18:15.035 --> 18:18.270
But the sooner you start
focusing on that goal,
the better.

18:18.271 --> 18:21.040
Go to med camp.
Start zeroing in on
the colleges you wanna get into

18:21.041 --> 18:22.708
and give yourself
some real options, okay?

18:22.709 --> 18:24.410
Why don't you do that?
Why don't you get involved

18:24.411 --> 18:26.545
in your own life
and start focusing
on yourself for a change?

18:26.546 --> 18:28.614
Because I don't want to.

18:36.389 --> 18:38.891
So, Adrian's pregnant.

18:38.892 --> 18:40.826
Well, I don't know, Tom.

18:40.827 --> 18:43.729
But whether she is or not,
that's nobody's business
but Adrian's.

19:00.225 --> 19:01.392
Good morning.

19:01.393 --> 19:03.661
Yeah. Good morning.

19:03.662 --> 19:07.431
Why are you wearing a suit?
Are you going somewhere?

19:07.432 --> 19:10.067
I hope so.
It's time for me to get a job.

19:10.068 --> 19:12.336
In this economy?

19:12.337 --> 19:14.271
[chuckles]
I'm just kidding.

19:14.272 --> 19:16.774
I was just repeating
your little joke
that you made to Jeff.

19:16.775 --> 19:19.243
Jeff told me.
Actually, I thought
it was kind of funny,

19:19.244 --> 19:20.911
but I'm sure it was
much funnier when you said it.

19:22.814 --> 19:24.415
Okay, you know,
I think it's great.

19:24.416 --> 19:26.083
You should get a job.

19:26.084 --> 19:27.418
I will.

19:27.419 --> 19:30.487
First, I will get a job,

19:30.488 --> 19:32.690
and then I will
find a place to live.

19:32.691 --> 19:34.959
You don't need a place to live.
You have a place to live.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.894
You can live right here.

19:36.895 --> 19:39.597
And, Tom, why are you
suddenly thinking
about getting a job?

19:39.598 --> 19:41.732
I'm thinking
I might get married.

19:43.835 --> 19:45.002
Oh.

19:45.003 --> 19:46.437
Are you okay with that?

19:46.438 --> 19:48.706
Uh, well,

19:48.707 --> 19:51.675
yeah, I guess
I'm okay with that.

19:51.676 --> 19:55.279
But, uh, yeah, first,
you need to get a job.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.314
And then I get
my own apartment.

19:57.315 --> 19:58.682
Well, I don't know about that.

19:58.683 --> 20:02.219
But, um, you know, actually,

20:02.220 --> 20:05.356
you can live in the guest house,
you know, eventually.

20:05.357 --> 20:07.024
It's kind of like
an apartment.

20:07.025 --> 20:09.026
The guest house?

20:09.027 --> 20:11.996
You mean, the haunted house?

20:11.997 --> 20:14.365
[chuckling]
Come on, honey.
It's not haunted.

20:14.366 --> 20:16.033
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.

20:16.034 --> 20:18.769
That's where Dad

20:18.770 --> 20:21.672
went when he wanted
to be alone.

20:21.673 --> 20:23.841
He's in there.
I know he's in there.

20:23.842 --> 20:25.843
Come on, honey.
He's not in there.

20:25.844 --> 20:27.711
And we don't believe
in ghosts around here.

20:27.712 --> 20:29.046
I do.

20:30.181 --> 20:33.484
But I will live
in a haunted house

20:33.485 --> 20:35.486
if I have to.

20:35.487 --> 20:38.088
I am getting a job,

20:38.089 --> 20:40.391
and I am getting married.

20:40.392 --> 20:43.127
Okay. Well,
we can think about all that,

20:43.128 --> 20:45.562
but, well, one thing
at a time, okay?

20:45.563 --> 20:46.930
We don't need
to rush into anything.

20:46.931 --> 20:50.267
Oh, no, I don't wanna
live with you.
Accept it.

20:51.770 --> 20:55.439
Tom, when you say
you wanna get married,

20:55.440 --> 20:57.474
you do mean to Tammy,
don't you?

20:57.475 --> 21:00.778
I'll let you know.

21:02.714 --> 21:04.882
You're absolutely sure
you can find a place.

21:04.883 --> 21:06.817
I'm sure.
I have a couple offers,

21:06.818 --> 21:08.819
but they're just
guys from the team,

21:08.820 --> 21:11.455
and I don't really wanna live
in a party atmosphere,
you know?

21:11.456 --> 21:13.757
I gotta think about my grades
and getting into college.

21:13.758 --> 21:15.993
So you have no prospects.
No. I do.

21:15.994 --> 21:18.562
No pressure,
but we're running out of time.

21:18.563 --> 21:21.465
Time's up. Go.
I'll settle on someplace today.

21:21.466 --> 21:22.466
Jack--

21:22.467 --> 21:24.234
Mom, I promise, I will.

21:24.235 --> 21:26.103
If nothing else,
Ricky said I could stay there.

21:26.104 --> 21:28.639
At Ricky's apartment?
I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.207
I think you need
parents around.

21:30.208 --> 21:32.509
All right.
Then I'll stay with Coach.
The school allows that?

21:32.510 --> 21:34.278
Yeah. Other guys have
stayed there temporarily.

21:34.279 --> 21:36.213
Really?
Because that would be great.

21:36.214 --> 21:38.649
I love Coach Carter,
and he would definitely
keep you in line.

21:39.951 --> 21:42.252
Ah. So that's why
you're still looking

21:42.253 --> 21:44.354
for someplace other
than Coach Carter's.

21:44.355 --> 21:45.422
Yeah.

21:45.423 --> 21:47.091
All right. Well,

21:47.092 --> 21:49.126
if you don't find something
by the end of the week,

21:49.127 --> 21:51.361
I suggest you take advantage
of that offer.

21:51.362 --> 21:53.630
All right.
I feel so guilty
about this.

21:53.631 --> 21:55.899
You don't look guilty.
You look happy.

21:55.900 --> 21:58.335
And you deserve
some happiness, Mom.

21:58.336 --> 22:01.205
It's okay, really.
I'm practically a grown man.

22:01.206 --> 22:02.940
But you'll always
be my baby.

22:02.941 --> 22:04.775
Aw, Mom.

22:09.247 --> 22:10.948
By the way,
how's Madison?

22:10.949 --> 22:12.816
She's good.
I like Madison.

22:12.817 --> 22:14.151
I know. So do I.

22:14.152 --> 22:16.487
But you had dinner over
at Grace's house last night.

22:16.488 --> 22:18.722
We're just friends.
Friends who have had sex.

22:18.723 --> 22:19.890
But we're just friends now.

22:19.891 --> 22:21.725
Don't do anything stupid
with your friend.

22:21.726 --> 22:22.693
Believe me, we won't.

22:24.496 --> 22:26.063
I'm surrounded by stupid.

22:26.064 --> 22:28.265
What's that mean?

22:28.266 --> 22:30.601
That means I think Adrian
and Ben did something stupid.

22:30.602 --> 22:32.269
Something stupid like...

22:32.270 --> 22:34.171
Something stupid
like Ricky and Amy did.

22:34.172 --> 22:35.339
Adrian's having a baby?

22:35.340 --> 22:36.573
I don't know
if she's having it.

22:36.574 --> 22:39.543
Oh, boy.
I feel for Adrian and Ben,

22:39.544 --> 22:41.345
but I am glad it's not you.

22:41.346 --> 22:44.515
I am really, really glad
it's not you.

22:44.516 --> 22:46.350
So you bring
this up because...

22:46.351 --> 22:48.886
Because Grace thinks
we need to gather around Adrian

22:48.887 --> 22:51.321
and support her
and encourage her
to have the baby.

22:51.322 --> 22:52.322
And what do you think?

22:52.323 --> 22:53.824
I think we should
stay out of it.

22:53.825 --> 22:55.759
It's a really
personal decision.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.195
The most personal.
What do you think?

22:58.196 --> 23:00.063
I think what
I've always thought.

23:00.064 --> 23:01.565
Stay away from Grace.
I like Madison.

23:01.566 --> 23:02.733
[chuckles]

23:02.734 --> 23:05.903
I hate to hear this
about Adrian and Ben.

23:05.904 --> 23:09.139
Sex can be fun
and very complicated,

23:09.140 --> 23:11.275
especially at your age.

23:11.276 --> 23:13.844
I know I had
a lot of fun with your father
when we were younger,

23:13.845 --> 23:15.345
but we were careful.

23:15.346 --> 23:17.381
We took every
precaution possible.

23:17.382 --> 23:19.850
I was on the pill.
We used a condom.

23:19.851 --> 23:21.819
So did Adrian and Ben,
and yet--

23:21.820 --> 23:23.153
And yet it can still happen.

23:23.154 --> 23:24.154
Yeah.

23:24.155 --> 23:26.423
Be careful out there, okay?

23:26.424 --> 23:28.192
Promise?
Promise.

23:33.965 --> 23:35.332
How are you feeling?

23:35.333 --> 23:36.867
I'm feeling fine.

23:36.868 --> 23:38.368
I don't wanna talk
about how I'm feeling

23:38.369 --> 23:39.937
because I don't wanna
think about it, okay?

23:39.938 --> 23:41.438
I think about it,
I get sick.

23:41.439 --> 23:42.506
Sorry.

23:42.507 --> 23:44.208
Ben, I know
you mean well, but--

23:44.209 --> 23:45.876
I don't mean well.

23:45.877 --> 23:48.979
I just asked you
to meet me here early
because my dad wants us to talk.

23:48.980 --> 23:52.149
And I met you here early
because I'm hiding from my dad,

23:52.150 --> 23:54.618
because I don't wanna talk

23:54.619 --> 23:56.386
to him or to you
or to Grace.

23:56.387 --> 23:58.355
I'm avoiding her.

23:58.356 --> 24:00.457
Or I'm trying to.

24:00.458 --> 24:02.659
And if you wanna
do something for me,

24:02.660 --> 24:04.828
go around the corner
and see if she's there.

24:04.829 --> 24:06.763
And if she is,
talk to her.

24:06.764 --> 24:09.700
That's who you can talk to.
And tell her
to leave me alone.

24:09.701 --> 24:10.734
I don't know.

24:10.735 --> 24:12.669
You don't know what?

24:12.670 --> 24:14.605
Just do it. Please?

24:14.606 --> 24:16.039
Okay.

24:32.824 --> 24:34.324
You looking for Adrian?

24:34.325 --> 24:35.659
Hi, Ben.

24:35.660 --> 24:37.194
Yeah, I'm looking
for Adrian.

24:37.195 --> 24:39.196
I didn't even say good morning.
Good morning.

24:39.197 --> 24:42.032
Good morning, Ben.
You're my friend,
right, Grace?

24:42.033 --> 24:45.168
Of course I'm your friend.
I'm friends with Adrian, too.

24:45.169 --> 24:47.271
And as our friend,
you wouldn't do anything

24:47.272 --> 24:48.739
to hurt either one of us,
right?

24:48.740 --> 24:49.740
No, of course not.

24:49.741 --> 24:51.742
Grace, please,

24:51.743 --> 24:53.744
please just leave this
to Adrian.

24:53.745 --> 24:55.746
Let Adrian do whatever
Adrian wants to do.

24:55.747 --> 24:57.748
I want to, Ben.
I just don't know if I can.

24:57.749 --> 24:59.249
[door opens]

25:11.930 --> 25:13.897
I'm so sorry
about last night.

25:13.898 --> 25:15.565
Me, too.

25:17.769 --> 25:19.736
This. This is what
I was talking about.

25:19.737 --> 25:22.272
Something is going on.
Not really.

25:22.273 --> 25:23.807
Well, something's
going on with me.

25:23.808 --> 25:25.042
Really?

25:25.043 --> 25:27.411
Yeah. That's why
I'm here early.

25:27.412 --> 25:30.647
Because of that summer
music program in New York
I told you about yesterday,

25:30.648 --> 25:32.649
the one that offered me
the scholarship and housing

25:32.650 --> 25:35.252
and living expenses
and everything.

25:35.253 --> 25:36.586
I really wanna go.

25:36.587 --> 25:38.588
I just don't want to leave
you and John,

25:38.589 --> 25:40.490
but I wanna go.

25:40.491 --> 25:42.859
Ben, say something. Please?

25:44.395 --> 25:45.729
Ah, Amy.

25:45.730 --> 25:47.664
Bye-bye, Ben.
Catch you later.

25:47.665 --> 25:49.666
Did you have a good time
last night with Ben?
I hope so.

25:49.667 --> 25:51.969
And I hope you got
a lot of sleep because,
unfortunately,

25:51.970 --> 25:55.005
we're gonna need to make
this decision a little bit
quicker than I thought.

25:55.006 --> 25:56.606
Okay? Come on.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.886
This is my opinion,
my professional opinion--

26:02.887 --> 26:05.188
as a trained counselor
with a doctorate

26:05.189 --> 26:07.724
in educational counseling
but no children--

26:07.725 --> 26:09.359
Go.
John just turned one.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.528
[sighs]
All right. I hate to brag,

26:11.529 --> 26:14.231
but my master's thesis
was on the hormones
of attachment.

26:14.232 --> 26:17.267
Secure attachment
is typically solidified
by one year.

26:17.268 --> 26:19.102
Now, there may be
a short adjustment,

26:19.103 --> 26:22.606
but as long as another caregiver
gives John adequate attention,
he'll be just fine.

26:22.607 --> 26:25.709
Really? Because I wanna go,
I just don't know how I can.

26:25.710 --> 26:27.577
Amy, it's not like
you're a single mom

26:27.578 --> 26:29.613
living on your own
with no one to help you.

26:29.614 --> 26:31.548
You've got your mom and dad,
you live at home,

26:31.549 --> 26:34.151
and Ricky, John's dad,
is very much involved
in his life.

26:34.152 --> 26:36.486
I really wanna go,
but you know me--

26:36.487 --> 26:38.188
Or you don't know me.

26:38.189 --> 26:40.857
But I just want everyone
to be okay with it.

26:40.858 --> 26:42.292
I want everyone's approval.

26:42.293 --> 26:44.361
Oh, Amy,
don't get so caught up

26:44.362 --> 26:47.097
in, you know, public opinion
and approval and attention.

26:47.098 --> 26:51.134
Just do it,
with your parents' approval,
of course, and Ricky's.

26:51.135 --> 26:54.304
I slipped out of the house
this morning
before anyone else was up.

26:54.305 --> 26:57.908
I wanted to spend some time
alone with John
before I took him to daycare.

26:57.909 --> 27:01.211
I just wanted to see
if I really thought I could
leave him for four weeks.

27:01.212 --> 27:02.712
It's four whole weeks.

27:02.713 --> 27:05.315
I love John more
than I love anyone
or anything else in the world.

27:05.316 --> 27:07.717
Then I guess you're
gonna have to do this
for John's mother, aren't you?

27:09.153 --> 27:10.487
Go forth.

27:10.488 --> 27:12.489
Gather your troops.
Get their blessings.

27:12.490 --> 27:15.025
I kind of have to tell
the school your decision
first thing in the morning.

27:15.026 --> 27:16.259
What?
Yeah.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.361
I, uh, sort of missed that
in the fine print yesterday.

27:18.362 --> 27:20.130
You have to leave
[clears throat]
tomorrow.

27:20.131 --> 27:21.865
Well, and then I come back.

27:21.866 --> 27:24.534
No. Mm-mm. No.
But school's not even out.

27:24.535 --> 27:26.303
Yeah. That.
I'll take care of that, too.

27:26.304 --> 27:29.439
With all the earthquakes
and the fires
and the mudslides and all that,

27:29.440 --> 27:31.741
our school year is running
a little bit behind
the rest of the country.

27:31.742 --> 27:33.610
So I kind of got you
into this program

27:33.611 --> 27:36.079
because someone else canceled,
and you were kind of on reserve.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.415
But you made it.
So get out there.

27:38.416 --> 27:40.617
Talk to your friends and family
and make up your mind.

27:40.618 --> 27:42.319
We don't have much time.
[chuckles]

27:42.320 --> 27:44.287
[chuckles]

27:44.288 --> 27:47.257
I was wrong.
You should go.

27:47.258 --> 27:50.660
And you can go, so go.

27:50.661 --> 27:53.330
If you stay here,
you're just gonna be unhappy,

27:53.331 --> 27:54.831
believe me.

27:54.832 --> 27:57.500
If you pass this up for John,
you're gonna resent him.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.502
So go. He'll be fine.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.004
I'll take care of him.

28:01.005 --> 28:03.306
I'll even stay at your house
with him Monday through Friday

28:03.307 --> 28:04.975
so he'll be
on the same schedule.

28:04.976 --> 28:08.712
I mean,
I don't wanna stay there,
but I will.

28:08.713 --> 28:10.747
Well, I said you should go.

28:13.751 --> 28:15.885
The question is,
why she said you should go.

28:15.886 --> 28:17.420
Not that it isn't a good idea.

28:17.421 --> 28:19.956
It's a good idea.
I'd love to go to New York.

28:19.957 --> 28:23.260
Well, I feel like
if anybody's gonna visit you,
it should be Lauren and me.

28:23.261 --> 28:25.495
Maybe we could audition
for something
while we're out there.

28:25.496 --> 28:28.164
And then, like,
in a couple years, we could
all go to school together,

28:28.165 --> 28:30.834
and we could get, like,
a cute little apartment
on the West Side,

28:30.835 --> 28:32.836
and we could just hang out
and meet guys.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.771
<i>It would be just like
Sex and the City.</i>

28:34.772 --> 28:36.373
I think you should go.

28:36.374 --> 28:38.275
And don't let Ben
stop you from going.

28:38.276 --> 28:40.510
Ben will wait for you.
loves you.

28:40.511 --> 28:43.046
But he shouldn't keep you
from having a good time.

28:43.047 --> 28:44.981
You deserve
to have a good time.

28:44.982 --> 28:47.250
Remember,
you're a teenage mother.

28:47.251 --> 28:50.887
This could be your last chance
to have a good time. Go.

28:50.888 --> 28:53.189
What, are you afraid
to go to New York and compete?

28:53.190 --> 28:55.692
Huh? Afraid you don't have
what it takes?

28:55.693 --> 28:58.295
Afraid of failing?
I would be.

28:58.296 --> 29:00.297
But you should go.

29:00.298 --> 29:02.299
I've never actually heard you
play the French horn.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.301
But I know you've got chutzpah.
You know how I know?

29:04.302 --> 29:07.103
You came to school pregnant,
had the baby,
you came back to school.

29:07.104 --> 29:09.806
This could not
be harder than that,
no matter what Hank just said.

29:09.807 --> 29:11.308
This is great news.

29:11.309 --> 29:13.243
I mean, for you.

29:13.244 --> 29:15.045
I'm so happy.

29:15.046 --> 29:17.514
For you. Wow.

29:17.515 --> 29:19.516
It's gonna be a great summer.

29:19.517 --> 29:21.017
For you.

29:21.018 --> 29:23.086
You definitely should go.

29:23.087 --> 29:26.923
Definitely.
Hey, your room's not gonna be...

29:26.924 --> 29:29.426
Nah, I don't guess
that would work.

29:29.427 --> 29:30.927
You should go.

29:30.928 --> 29:32.696
Don't worry about me.
I'm gonna be fine.

29:32.697 --> 29:34.631
I love you, Amy.

29:34.632 --> 29:37.000
You know that, right,
that I love you?

29:37.001 --> 29:39.002
And if I can
help out with John,

29:39.003 --> 29:41.004
I'd be more than happy
to do anything that Ricky

29:41.005 --> 29:43.039
or your family
needs me to do.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.308
I love John, too.

29:45.309 --> 29:46.976
[scoffs]

29:46.977 --> 29:48.945
I'm making too big a deal
out of this.

29:48.946 --> 29:51.514
It's four weeks.
It's not that big a deal.

29:51.515 --> 29:54.951
What can happen
in four weeks?

29:54.952 --> 29:57.687
I am not in love
with your Ben, so go.

29:57.688 --> 30:00.490
He'll be here when you get back.
Go to New York.

30:00.491 --> 30:02.425
I heard you were
asking around about New York.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.594
And everyone thinks
you should go.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.329
Everyone.

30:06.330 --> 30:09.666
Maybe people will quit
talking about you.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.901
I went to New York once.
It was great.

30:11.902 --> 30:14.371
But I got mugged.

30:14.372 --> 30:16.473
Will you bring me
one of those snow globes--

30:16.474 --> 30:18.408
one with the Chrysler Building?

30:18.409 --> 30:20.176
I have a collection.

30:20.177 --> 30:24.447
Your parents are letting
you do that? You?

30:24.448 --> 30:26.649
You have to go, Amy.

30:26.650 --> 30:29.919
It's always been your dream
to go to New York
and study music.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.655
You can live your dreams.
You can.

30:32.656 --> 30:34.357
You just can't quit dreaming.

30:34.358 --> 30:36.359
You really wanna play
the French horn that badly?

30:36.360 --> 30:39.462
Isn't that how you got
in trouble in the first place?

30:39.463 --> 30:41.865
[sighs]
All right. Go.

30:41.866 --> 30:43.800
You should go.
You should.

30:43.801 --> 30:45.802
I mean, it's not
costing me anything, right?

30:45.803 --> 30:47.337
[chuckles]

31:01.819 --> 31:03.520
[chuckles]

31:07.391 --> 31:09.959
So we're just gonna
let her go to New York
just like that?

31:09.960 --> 31:12.529
Just like that.
I don't really think
we have a choice.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.230
We have a choice.
We can tell her no.

31:14.231 --> 31:15.999
Do you really wanna
tell Amy no?

31:16.000 --> 31:19.202
No, not really.
I'm kind of proud of her.

31:19.203 --> 31:21.638
More importantly,
I think she's kind of
proud of herself.

31:21.639 --> 31:23.573
I'm kind of proud
of us, too,

31:23.574 --> 31:26.309
what with being divorced
and not liking each other
so much right now

31:26.310 --> 31:28.878
and not agreeing
on almost everything,

31:28.879 --> 31:31.214
we're still able to come
together and do something nice
for our daughter.

31:31.215 --> 31:32.148
Yeah.

31:33.851 --> 31:36.986
You wouldn't wanna maybe
do something nice
for each other?

31:36.987 --> 31:38.354
You mean--

31:38.355 --> 31:41.057
I mean,
it's been a long time.

31:41.058 --> 31:42.625
Yeah, it has been
a long time.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.995
Yeah, I think I can
go for that.

31:45.996 --> 31:47.797
Hand me that boy.

31:47.798 --> 31:51.067
I'll be right back.
Come on, my man.

31:54.438 --> 31:55.872
Moose, out.

31:55.873 --> 31:57.240
[whines]

32:05.516 --> 32:07.150
[sighs]

32:07.151 --> 32:09.652
Her mother kept saying
something was wrong.

32:09.653 --> 32:11.154
I just...

32:11.155 --> 32:12.889
I didn't...
[sighs]

32:12.890 --> 32:15.024
Oh, God. A baby?

32:15.025 --> 32:17.026
Well...

32:17.027 --> 32:18.328
"Well"?

32:18.329 --> 32:20.163
I guess it's not
the worst thing that can happen.

32:20.164 --> 32:23.233
What? Yes,
it is the worst thing
that can happen.

32:23.234 --> 32:26.236
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

32:26.237 --> 32:30.106
Ben and Adrian-- the two of them
took every precaution possible.

32:30.107 --> 32:32.041
It just happened.
How?

32:32.042 --> 32:34.911
I think there was
some technical problems.

32:34.912 --> 32:36.913
New pill.

32:36.914 --> 32:38.815
Condom broke.

32:38.816 --> 32:40.750
We just
became a family.

32:40.751 --> 32:43.319
We're just starting out,
the three of us.

32:43.320 --> 32:46.556
Cindy hasn't even spent
a night in the house yet
as my wife.

32:46.557 --> 32:48.491
She left to go to work.

32:48.492 --> 32:50.493
Now she's coming back
tonight, and...

32:50.494 --> 32:51.661
[sighs]

32:51.662 --> 32:55.331
She kept saying
that something was wrong.

32:55.332 --> 32:57.534
I said that already.

32:57.535 --> 32:59.836
I don't know what to say.
I just...

32:59.837 --> 33:01.337
I didn't...

33:01.338 --> 33:03.339
Oh, God. A baby?

33:06.143 --> 33:08.578
Look, I know it has to
be Adrian's decision, but--

33:08.579 --> 33:10.413
Whoa, whoa.
Stop right there.

33:10.414 --> 33:13.850
Don't even think about it.
She's not doing that.

33:13.851 --> 33:17.620
She's not...
terminating the pregnancy.
I won't allow it.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.756
Well, I guess that's something
the three of you
have to talk about.

33:19.757 --> 33:22.692
Oh. Is that what you want?

33:22.693 --> 33:25.194
You want her
to terminate the pregnancy?

33:25.195 --> 33:28.164
Are you here to offer me money
for her to terminate
the pregnancy?

33:28.165 --> 33:30.400
Hey, that's not
what I'm here for.

33:30.401 --> 33:32.135
That's not what
I'm her for at all.

33:32.136 --> 33:35.271
I'm not thinking that at all.
I'm not here to offer you money.

33:35.272 --> 33:37.273
I'm just here to tell you
that I'll see to it

33:37.274 --> 33:39.909
that my son steps up
to the plate here

33:39.910 --> 33:42.078
and supports your daughter
in whatever she wants to do.

33:43.447 --> 33:45.114
I'm sorry.

33:45.115 --> 33:47.050
I'm sorry I said that.

33:47.051 --> 33:48.952
I don't know
what I'm saying.

33:48.953 --> 33:50.587
Oh, God.

33:50.588 --> 33:52.755
A baby.

33:52.756 --> 33:55.525
I'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you this.

33:55.526 --> 33:57.760
I was hoping
you knew already.

33:58.829 --> 34:01.030
But I just felt
I needed to talk to you

34:01.031 --> 34:03.399
because time
is of the essence.

34:05.302 --> 34:08.605
And please, please, don't go hn
I told you.

34:08.606 --> 34:10.873
Please, let her tell you.

34:10.873 --> 34:12.875
Maybe since you know already,

34:12.876 --> 34:15.311
it'll be easier to handle.

34:15.312 --> 34:17.647
Okay, not easier.

34:19.248 --> 34:21.684
Look, Ruben, I'm sorry.

34:21.685 --> 34:24.253
I'm sorry this happened
to Ben,

34:24.254 --> 34:27.156
to Adrian, to all of us.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.199
How was school today?

34:46.234 --> 34:48.134
You asked me that already.
School was school.

34:48.168 --> 34:49.636
Anything going on
at school?

34:49.670 --> 34:51.071
No.

34:52.373 --> 34:55.308
Anything going on in life?

34:55.342 --> 34:57.310
What?

34:57.345 --> 34:59.379
Well, I just wanna know
if there's anything going on

34:59.413 --> 35:02.682
with Ricky or Ben...

35:02.717 --> 35:04.851
or any other guy

35:04.885 --> 35:07.887
or any of your friends--
Grace or, um--

35:07.922 --> 35:10.557
Or Grace.
That's my only friend.

35:10.591 --> 35:13.526
And she's getting on my nerves
right now, but so are you.

35:13.561 --> 35:15.595
I have a test tomorrow.
I'm trying to study here.

35:15.630 --> 35:17.998
Oh, a test, huh?
Anything I can help you with?

35:18.032 --> 35:19.366
Nope.

35:21.769 --> 35:23.970
It's almost time
for your mom to get home.

35:25.473 --> 35:27.407
It's two hours
until she gets home.

35:27.441 --> 35:30.610
And I'm not gonna
stay up two hours,
because you know her.

35:30.645 --> 35:33.513
It'll probably be
past the time she says
she'll get here.

35:33.547 --> 35:34.781
Good night.

35:34.815 --> 35:36.583
Wait.
Yeah?

35:37.518 --> 35:40.253
I just, uh...

35:40.288 --> 35:43.089
I just wanna tell you
that I love you, Adrian,

35:43.124 --> 35:45.325
and that I'm really happy
that you're my daughter,

35:46.661 --> 35:49.095
and that
I married your mother.

35:49.130 --> 35:50.997
We're a family,

35:51.032 --> 35:55.001
and we're a family
in sickness and in health,

35:55.036 --> 35:57.570
whether we're richer
or poorer or--

35:57.605 --> 36:00.307
Have you been drinking?
No. No, I haven't.

36:00.341 --> 36:03.943
Well, maybe you should
go to bed, get some rest.

36:03.978 --> 36:06.346
You seem a little odd.
Good night.

36:06.380 --> 36:08.915
Good night.

36:08.949 --> 36:10.950
I love you, Adrian.

36:10.985 --> 36:13.086
I love you.

36:17.058 --> 36:18.992
[knocking on door]

36:19.026 --> 36:21.361
Hey, how was your day today?
How'd it go?

36:23.030 --> 36:27.133
[sighs]
Amy's going to a music program
in New York, and she's leaving.

36:27.168 --> 36:30.437
And I can't, Dad.
I can't tell her.
Not before she takes off.

36:30.471 --> 36:32.405
Which is when?
Tomorrow.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.407
Oh, jeez, Ben.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.509
It's an honors music program.

36:36.544 --> 36:39.546
It's the first good thing
that's happened to Amy
in a long time.

36:39.580 --> 36:41.014
Everyone's so excited for her.

36:41.048 --> 36:43.283
Really, Dad, I can't tell her.
Not now.

36:43.317 --> 36:45.518
Yeah, I guess not.

36:45.553 --> 36:47.187
Oh, thank heavens
you said that,

36:47.221 --> 36:49.189
because I cannot
take the pressure of telling her

36:49.223 --> 36:51.624
and ruining her life yet again
before she goes off
for the summer.

36:51.659 --> 36:55.061
How's it going with Adrian?
You talk to her?

36:55.096 --> 36:57.063
I talked to her.
Her mom's getting home tonight,

36:57.098 --> 36:59.332
and she's talking to her
tomorrow morning.

36:59.367 --> 37:01.901
And then she said
that we'll talk.

37:01.936 --> 37:03.770
Although I don't know why.

37:03.804 --> 37:06.039
I'm sure that
when she talks to her mom,
they'll make the decision,

37:06.073 --> 37:07.941
and I'll have very little
to do with it.

37:07.975 --> 37:11.144
Even though I told her
that I do wanna be involved,
per your request.

37:11.178 --> 37:13.580
Good. Good.
You talked to her.
That's good.

37:13.614 --> 37:15.515
Honestly, Dad,

37:15.549 --> 37:18.451
I wanna be okay with
whatever decision Adrian makes,

37:18.486 --> 37:20.787
but I'm not so sure.

37:20.821 --> 37:23.723
I'm getting really nervous

37:23.758 --> 37:25.725
that she's gonna go
and do something tomorrow

37:25.760 --> 37:27.627
that I'll regret

37:27.661 --> 37:30.296
or that she'll regret.

37:30.331 --> 37:32.799
I don't know.
I don't know either.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.901
But I, uh...

37:35.936 --> 37:38.204
Listen, uh,
here's the thing.

37:38.239 --> 37:39.839
Dad, you don't look so good.

37:41.809 --> 37:43.777
I have to tell you
something, Ben.

37:43.811 --> 37:45.712
It's probably
gonna make you angry,

37:45.746 --> 37:48.515
but you and I
are gonna be angry
off and on with each other.

37:48.549 --> 37:52.018
I mean, that happens,
especially with
these situations.

37:52.052 --> 37:53.953
What?

37:53.988 --> 37:56.456
I wasn't at
a business dinner.

37:56.490 --> 37:59.526
I had dinner
with Adrian's dad.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.861
I told him.

38:01.896 --> 38:04.164
And I told him we'll dÃƒÂ³
whatever they needed us to do.

38:04.198 --> 38:05.832
"Us"?

38:05.866 --> 38:07.767
This isn't about us.

38:07.802 --> 38:11.538
This is about me and Adrian
and Amy and...

38:11.572 --> 38:13.473
Dad, how could you do that?

38:13.507 --> 38:14.741
I had to.

38:14.775 --> 38:17.710
I thought it was
the right thing to do,
and it was.

38:17.745 --> 38:20.046
[scoffs]

38:21.248 --> 38:23.183
It's late.
It's almost midnight.

38:23.217 --> 38:25.084
I've gotta go.
I know.

38:25.119 --> 38:27.187
I just wanna make sure
you know where everything is.

38:27.221 --> 38:30.089
I know where everything is.
I'm here almost every day.

38:30.124 --> 38:31.858
[chuckles]

38:31.892 --> 38:34.928
I can't believe
that you'd stay here
for a month.

38:34.962 --> 38:37.997
It is so nice of you,
especially with my crazy family.

38:38.032 --> 38:40.099
John'll miss you.

38:40.134 --> 38:41.734
But he'll be fine.

38:41.769 --> 38:43.803
But I am taking him
to my apartment on the weekends

38:43.838 --> 38:46.506
and over to my family's house
just like we said I could do,

38:46.540 --> 38:48.241
just like we agreed to.
I know.

38:48.275 --> 38:51.411
But...
[sighs]

38:51.445 --> 38:52.846
Okay.

38:52.880 --> 38:56.182
But if you decide that you
wanna stay here on the weekends

38:56.217 --> 38:58.218
and not start taking him
to your place on the weekends

38:58.252 --> 39:00.119
until after I get back,
you could do that.

39:00.154 --> 39:02.355
I could do that.
Please do that.

39:02.389 --> 39:04.524
Stay here for a month
with your dad

39:04.558 --> 39:07.026
and your mom and Robbie
and Ashley?

39:07.061 --> 39:09.596
It's just a month.
You'll go to school,

39:09.630 --> 39:11.431
and when you're out of school,
you'll go to work.

39:11.465 --> 39:13.533
It won't be so bad.
It's what I do every day.

39:13.567 --> 39:15.735
I'll think about it.
We'll see how it goes.

39:15.769 --> 39:17.070
Please?

39:17.104 --> 39:18.238
Okay, Amy.

39:18.272 --> 39:20.206
If it means that much
to you, okay.

39:20.241 --> 39:21.641
I'll try. No promises.

39:21.675 --> 39:23.610
Thank you.
[laughs]

39:23.644 --> 39:25.678
Thank you, thank you.
I love you.

39:25.713 --> 39:27.647
You what?
Like a brother.

39:27.681 --> 39:30.950
Like the father of my baby
that I don't wanna be with.
Gee, thanks.

39:30.985 --> 39:33.686
You know what I mean.
And I love Ben.
You know that.

39:34.955 --> 39:36.589
I do.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.224
He's driving me
to the airport tomorrow.

39:38.259 --> 39:41.761
Well, his driver's
driving us to the airport
tomorrow afternoon.

39:41.795 --> 39:44.564
And then, tomorrow night,
I'll be in New York!
[laughs]

39:44.598 --> 39:46.165
[chuckles]

39:46.200 --> 39:48.535
I'm really scared
but mostly excited.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.804
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

39:51.839 --> 39:53.907
Something good
finally happened to me.

40:08.289 --> 40:11.157
Hi, husband.
I'm home.

40:11.191 --> 40:13.760
Hey, wife.

40:13.794 --> 40:16.162
I'm happy to have you home.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.568
What's the matter?

40:25.439 --> 40:27.273
Adrian's pregnant.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
