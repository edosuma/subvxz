00:09.218 --> 00:10.844
Ba-bum.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.013
[croaks]

00:14.556 --> 00:15.891
[panting]

00:17.184 --> 00:19.978
[Runaan]
<i>Previously on</i> The Dragon Prince...

00:20.604 --> 00:22.314
[Claudia] Well, maybe it's just a mirror.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.565
[Viren sighs]

00:23.649 --> 00:26.526
Of all the treasures, artifacts and relics

00:26.610 --> 00:28.779
in the lair
of the Dragon King and Queen...

00:28.862 --> 00:30.864
they kept this close to where they slept.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.115
It must be important.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.575
Oh, no.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.911
Something's wrong with the egg.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.539
I'm afraid it's dying.

00:38.622 --> 00:39.456
Wait!

00:39.998 --> 00:43.502
We learned about a miracle healer.
Someone who might be able to help the egg.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.878
And maybe your hand too!

00:44.962 --> 00:45.796
Really?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.965
The only catch is,
the healer lives up there...

00:48.048 --> 00:48.882
the Cursed Caldera.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.801
There she is! She's an elf!

00:50.884 --> 00:53.929
[mob clamoring]

00:56.265 --> 00:59.393
Forget it.
No point following them up there.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.812
They'll never make it out alive.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.440
[theme music playing]

01:20.539 --> 01:21.832
[roaring]

01:52.195 --> 01:53.614
[Callum] I think we're safe.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.658
[sarcastically] Safe? Sure.

01:56.742 --> 02:00.037
So, how are we supposed to find
this miracle healer?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.127
[Ellis] Come with me.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.754
I'll help you find her.

02:11.423 --> 02:14.384
-This way!
-[Ava barking]

02:23.101 --> 02:24.728
So...

02:24.811 --> 02:25.937
Hi, there.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.814
But who are you exactly?

02:27.898 --> 02:30.901
Me? I'm Ellis, and this is Ava.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.235
-She's a wolf.
-[panting]

02:32.319 --> 02:35.322
Wolf? Really? I thought bird.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.284
Oh, I should have introduced you guys.

02:39.368 --> 02:42.954
Ellis, this is Rayla,
who we originally met because, uh...

02:43.955 --> 02:47.793
Well, she broke into our castle,
trying to kill Ezran.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.714
But it doesn't matter.
We're past that now.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.426
People meet in so many interesting ways!

02:57.094 --> 02:59.721
Hmm. So how do we find this healer?

03:00.305 --> 03:03.642
Truth is, I never found her. She found us.

03:03.725 --> 03:08.605
We were hiding in a big, twisty,
hollow tree. Up near the rim.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.526
Then we need to get to that tree.
Even if it takes all night.

03:12.609 --> 03:16.071
Wait... that's all we have to go on?

03:16.154 --> 03:20.283
A weird tree, where this miracle healer
showed up three years ago?

03:20.367 --> 03:23.078
It's our only chance. Got a better idea?

03:23.161 --> 03:24.746
As a matter of fact...

03:25.580 --> 03:26.706
I do not.

03:27.249 --> 03:28.500
I'll get us to that tree.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.294
The healer will find us there,
and she'll save the egg!

03:31.378 --> 03:32.921
And maybe she can help your hand.

03:33.004 --> 03:36.717
Don't worry about my hand.
The egg is all that matters now.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.641
-[Bait exclaims]
-[Ezran yelps]

04:09.791 --> 04:12.544
[Ellis sighs] It's so beautiful.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.464
It's like the sky is painted with honey.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.507
Wow.

04:17.591 --> 04:21.595
[chuckles] Too bad it also means
the nightmare's about to begin.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.805
[stammers] What do you mean?

04:24.473 --> 04:28.852
Oh, you know, enormous monsters,
indescribable terrors.

04:28.935 --> 04:29.936
Stuff like that.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.980
-Stuff like that.
-Yeah.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.192
And the higher we go, the worse it'll get.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.612
All right! Well, let's go.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.906
No, no, no, wait.
We're going to need a plan.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.950
How do you plan for indescribable terrors?

04:44.034 --> 04:47.454
I feel like you need to be
able to describe them first.

04:47.537 --> 04:51.208
Um... horrifying! Blood-curdling.

04:51.875 --> 04:55.295
Creepy, but in a super extreme way

04:55.378 --> 04:58.173
that feels like it's lighting
your soul on fire.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.717
I think that helps.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.762
Wait! Wait, wait, wait! I've got it.

05:03.845 --> 05:07.140
Flash! Woof! Whoosh! Slish-slash!

05:10.602 --> 05:11.770
Awesome!

05:11.853 --> 05:14.189
Um, is he okay?

05:14.272 --> 05:16.942
I think he's finally cracked
under the pressure.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.069
No, that's the plan.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.862
Ezran, you have the first job.

05:20.946 --> 05:24.616
You hold Bait in the air so he can flash
and blind whatever monster it is.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.992
Whack!

05:26.076 --> 05:28.954
Wait... but then I'm not really
doing anything.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.622
I'm just kind of holding up Bait.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.667
You're support!
Every team needs a great support.

05:34.251 --> 05:35.210
Ellis, you're next.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.630
<i>Ava will bark, and you'll ride around</i>
<i>in circles to confuse the monster.</i>

05:38.713 --> 05:41.174
-[barks]
-I don't know.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.719
Do you think you can run around
and bark a lot, Ava?

05:44.803 --> 05:47.013
-[barking]
-She's ready!

05:47.097 --> 05:50.892
<i>Then, me, I'll use my windbreath spell.</i>
<i>Whoosh!</i>

05:50.976 --> 05:53.311
[gasps] You're going to cast a spell?

05:53.395 --> 05:56.731
It's just a simple rune thing I picked up.
No big deal.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.817
Yeah, he's going to blow on the monster.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.485
Ruffle its fur real good.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.738
It's either that, or the half
of the lightning spell I know.

06:03.822 --> 06:07.242
Specifically, the half that doesn't
shoot lightning out of my fingertips.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.160
That monster won't know what hit it!

06:09.744 --> 06:12.455
Oh, wait, it will. It'll be wind.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.292
-[laughs]
-Rayla!

06:15.375 --> 06:17.085
You're last. The finisher.

06:17.168 --> 06:22.382
<i>You'll take down the blinded, distracted,</i>
<i>windblown monster with your blades.</i>

06:22.465 --> 06:24.467
Slish-slash!

06:24.551 --> 06:26.177
My hand is in pretty bad shape.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.346
I'm only going to be able
to use one blade.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.349
Okay, then you're just... slash!

06:31.433 --> 06:34.686
No way. That won't work.
This is my slish hand.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.146
Uh, really?

06:36.688 --> 06:39.190
-No, not really, dummy.
-[Ezran laughs]

06:41.735 --> 06:45.322
Wait. Callum, you may be a dummy,
but you're not a fool!

06:45.405 --> 06:46.906
Am I supposed to feel flattered by this?

06:46.990 --> 06:51.411
You said Claudia called you a fool
when you interrupted her lightning spell.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.789
But I'll bet she was actually
trying to say "fulminis."

06:54.873 --> 06:57.000
It's the draconic word for lightning.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.045
So, if "fulminis" is the trigger word--

07:00.128 --> 07:02.047
Then you know the spell for lightning!

07:04.049 --> 07:05.800
Revised plan!

07:05.884 --> 07:09.262
Flash! Woof! Zap! Slash!

07:11.848 --> 07:12.849
[Rayla sighs]

07:48.510 --> 07:50.553
If you don't eat, you'll die.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.431
I am already dead.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.600
You don't look dead.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.270
Though that hand has seen better days.

08:00.021 --> 08:04.317
I went out of my way to acquire
some rare Xadian fruits.

08:04.401 --> 08:08.029
They're remarkable! So strange and exotic.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.742
And these Xadian oranges... no seeds.

08:13.702 --> 08:14.703
Incredible.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.082
No?

08:22.544 --> 08:25.839
I understand the whole
honor-in-not-eating thing,

08:26.381 --> 08:28.049
but at least drink something.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.266
Don't worry, it's berry juice.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.020
[sighs]

08:41.229 --> 08:42.856
I have a proposition.

08:42.939 --> 08:46.985
I simply want you to take a look
at an object, and tell me what it does.

08:47.068 --> 08:51.990
After that, I will unchain you
and you can walk out of here.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.786
Decide.

08:56.870 --> 09:00.749
You can be free,
or you can sit here and die.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.667
I told you.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.086
I am already dead.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.380
[sighs]

09:07.464 --> 09:10.467
Yes, wait a second.
I think I've heard about this.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.137
It's a Moonshadow elf thing, right?

09:14.220 --> 09:17.515
A philosophy of accepting you are
already dead...

09:17.599 --> 09:19.934
so you will not fear death.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.607
What a beautiful challenge
you've given me.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.319
I must come up with something
you will fear...

09:30.445 --> 09:32.447
more than death.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.541
[Gren] Excuse me.
I would love to try some Xadian fruit.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.420
Very good.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.227
Well, it's dark,

10:02.310 --> 10:05.396
but I think the scariest thing
I've seen so far is an angry cricket.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.899
And he's more, like, mildly annoyed.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.692
[cricket chirping]

10:09.776 --> 10:12.612
Yeah, are you sure this is
the Cursed Caldera?

10:13.154 --> 10:15.907
Or did we accidentally
wander up Humdrum Hill?

10:15.990 --> 10:17.492
[all laughing]

10:17.575 --> 10:21.996
Maybe we took a wrong turn
and wound up on Sleepy Slope?

10:22.580 --> 10:24.874
-[all laughing]
-[all sighing]

10:24.958 --> 10:26.543
I'll have to check my map,

10:26.626 --> 10:30.004
but I'm fairly certain I recognize
the unmistakable topography of...

10:30.088 --> 10:31.548
Mount Monotonous!

10:31.631 --> 10:32.715
[dead silence]

10:33.466 --> 10:37.595
[cricket chirping]

10:38.805 --> 10:44.769
Anyway, it is a little odd
that nothing bad has happened yet.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.397
-I see a huge, scary monster!
-[yelps]

10:49.023 --> 10:50.859
But don't worry, it's dead.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.403
Then why did you say it like that?

10:53.486 --> 10:56.406
-Say it like what?
-[echoing]

11:00.368 --> 11:02.203
[Ezran] I've never seen
anything like this.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.249
-And look at those circles.
-[Callum] Don't touch it.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.543
What a strange birthmark.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.670
I don't think that's a birthmark.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.964
It's a bite mark!

11:14.173 --> 11:17.719
You're right.
Something's drained all its blood.

11:17.802 --> 11:18.636
[Ellis] Guys!

11:18.720 --> 11:20.680
[growling]

11:20.763 --> 11:23.600
[Ellis] I see a huger, scarier monster!

11:23.683 --> 11:25.143
[roaring]

11:25.226 --> 11:27.729
The plan! Time for the plan! Ezran?

11:27.812 --> 11:29.939
Okay. Okay. Where's Bait?

11:30.023 --> 11:30.982
[cricket chirping]

11:31.774 --> 11:32.942
Bait, come on, you're supposed to--

11:33.443 --> 11:35.820
Ahh! Too soon! Too soon!

11:35.904 --> 11:37.030
I can't see!

11:37.113 --> 11:38.948
None of us can.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.410
[Ava barking]

11:47.749 --> 11:49.584
Okay, what about the rest of the plan?

11:49.667 --> 11:52.462
I probably shouldn't do lightning
if I can't see, right?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.505
Don't do the lightning!

11:55.048 --> 11:55.882
Maybe a new plan?

11:57.258 --> 11:58.509
Scatter! Run!

11:58.593 --> 11:59.928
Is that to distract the monster?

12:01.012 --> 12:03.181
[Callum] No, it's just to get away
and live!

12:06.684 --> 12:07.894
[Rayla] Come with me.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.897
Hop on. Ava will get us out of here.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.607
[roaring]

12:27.622 --> 12:29.332
You can climb trees right?

12:29.415 --> 12:30.416
[roaring]

12:38.466 --> 12:39.467
[grunting]

12:56.943 --> 12:58.403
[Rayla] What do we do now?

12:59.028 --> 13:02.281
I think that thing
is waiting for us down there.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.325
We don't even have that much blood!

13:04.867 --> 13:09.247
I know.
We would be a very unsatisfying snack.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.499
[roaring]

13:11.582 --> 13:14.127
We don't have a choice.
We just have to wait it out.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.797
Ugh, I'm sorry my plan was a mess.

13:18.464 --> 13:23.136
Nah, your plan was fine!
Our execution was a little off.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.681
It came out more like,
"Argh! Oops! Help! Run!"

13:45.074 --> 13:50.163
In a moment, I will remove this cover,
and you will tell me what you know.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.497
Understood?

13:55.585 --> 13:59.797
I've brought something that I hope
you will find motivating.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.382
[coins jingling]

14:01.966 --> 14:04.427
You're more foolish than I thought.

14:05.136 --> 14:08.181
Don't you know only humans can be bribed?

14:08.264 --> 14:10.016
Oh, this isn't a bribe.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.517
[coins clattering]

14:11.601 --> 14:12.769
It's a threat.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.855
Go on. Take a closer look.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.067
You're a monster.

14:19.150 --> 14:22.904
You're mistaken. I'm a pragmatist.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.827
It seems to be hanging in there.

14:30.745 --> 14:31.829
Barely.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.624
I'm so sorry I messed up the plan.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.918
Ah, you should cut yourself a break.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.545
Everyone messes up sometimes.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.799
Or in my case, all the times.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.050
What are you talking about?

14:44.133 --> 14:46.886
Trust me, if the plan hadn't gotten
messed up when Bait flashed,

14:46.969 --> 14:49.097
I'm sure it would have flopped
when it was my turn.

14:49.180 --> 14:52.934
Are you kidding? From what I can tell,
you're awesome at everything.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.229
Well, it's true.
I am pretty awesome at everything.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.608
Right up until the moment
when it really matters.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.070
And that's when I just... poof,
screw things up.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.155
What do you mean?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.657
-I don't know.
-[Bait grunts]

15:07.740 --> 15:12.453
I hesitate, think too much,
get confused about the right thing to do.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.997
And the next thing I know, I failed.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.714
[monster growling]

15:25.049 --> 15:30.471
I can't believe you're a mage.
I've never met an actual mage before.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.265
You're not at all what I expected.

15:32.348 --> 15:38.062
-What were you expecting?
-You know, taller, long robes, wrinklier.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.731
-Super smart.
-[chuckling]

15:40.815 --> 15:44.068
And maybe like a weird amulet
or something?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.906
Well, I am in the market for
a weird amulet, if you know anybody.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.742
[laughs] And you're so confident!

15:51.826 --> 15:53.661
It's funny to hear someone say that.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.913
I don't think of myself as confident.

15:55.997 --> 16:00.501
Really? You should be,
having all that incredible power.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.338
Maybe. The truth is, it's not me.

16:04.422 --> 16:05.548
It's this.

16:06.174 --> 16:09.385
All the magic, all the power,
all the confidence...

16:09.469 --> 16:13.222
It's just because of this amazing thing.
A Primal Stone!

16:18.519 --> 16:23.774
The morning I came to your castle,
my team was discovered by a human guard.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.739
<i>It was my job to chase him down</i>
<i>and stop him.</i>

16:32.992 --> 16:34.452
<i>-But when I caught him...</i>
-Please!

16:35.286 --> 16:38.289
<i>...he looked up at me, and he was</i>
<i>so afraid.</i>

16:43.628 --> 16:45.963
<i>And then I just let him go.</i>

16:52.637 --> 16:55.389
-I don't know why.
-Because you felt for him.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.267
But he was a human... my enemy.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.270
Yeah, but then you saw he was scared.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.066
And you knew he was a person,
just like you.

17:05.149 --> 17:09.028
That shouldn't have mattered.
I had a job to do.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.240
Do you realize
I'm an assassin who's never killed anyone?

17:12.323 --> 17:14.158
Uh, I think that's a good thing.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.498
And by the way,
thanks for failing at your mission.

17:20.581 --> 17:21.832
I like being alive.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.918
I'm glad you're alive, Ezran.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.088
Knowing you is definitely worth
losing a hand for.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.717
That's the weirdest, nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.762
Well, who knows,
maybe this is my unlucky hand,

17:34.845 --> 17:37.682
so when it falls off, my luck will change!

17:37.765 --> 17:40.226
-[Ezran] That's horrible.
-Funny, though?

17:40.309 --> 17:41.852
[Ezran] Funny and horrible.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.692
[Ellis] That Primal Stone needs you
to do all that amazing stuff.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.653
Without you, it's just a neat, glowy ball.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.114
I guess so.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.700
But without this, I'm nothing.

17:56.450 --> 18:00.162
Just a guy who can draw and make
wry comments from time to time.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.331
And they're not even that wry.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.667
I'm not convinced.

18:05.209 --> 18:10.339
I have a feeling you'd be pretty amazing
even without your magic ball.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.050
Well, you seem pretty great, too.

18:13.134 --> 18:15.511
-[Ava barks]
-And Ava's also great.

18:16.095 --> 18:16.929
Is it okay if I pet her?

18:17.013 --> 18:18.681
-[barks]
-Whoa!

18:18.764 --> 18:23.144
Aww, you're such a fuzzy wuv-munkin!
[chuckles]

18:23.227 --> 18:27.898
[Rayla yelling] Hey, guys?
I think that thing might be gone!

18:38.242 --> 18:41.370
Haven't seen it or heard it in a while.
Seems like it moved on.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.747
See ya, sucker!

18:43.289 --> 18:45.833
Get it? Because it's a giant leech?

18:45.916 --> 18:49.545
-So, more of a description than an insult?
-A little of both.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.547
Mmm-hmm.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.842
It's probably gone,
but let's not taunt it, okay?

18:54.925 --> 18:58.179
There's a little thing called irony,
where just as you say one thing,

18:58.262 --> 19:01.766
like you're really sure about it,
that's when the opposite happens.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.352
Nah. Maybe that's how things
work in stories,

19:04.435 --> 19:05.811
but in the real world--

19:05.895 --> 19:08.272
-[screeches]
-[all screaming]

19:17.031 --> 19:17.865
[Ezran screams]

19:18.824 --> 19:19.742
[both scream]

19:21.202 --> 19:22.495
[monster roars]

19:33.255 --> 19:34.590
[Ezran screams]

19:38.052 --> 19:39.512
[Ellis] That way!

19:39.595 --> 19:42.181
Focus! We can do this! The plan!

19:42.264 --> 19:43.557
Ez and Bait, you're up!

19:46.352 --> 19:47.186
Flash!

19:49.063 --> 19:50.648
[monster shrieking]

19:55.736 --> 19:58.030
Yes! Ellis and Ava! Woof!

19:59.782 --> 20:01.575
[Ava and Ellis barking]

20:08.999 --> 20:12.461
Perfect! My turn for... zap!

20:15.339 --> 20:17.925
Here goes nothing. Fulminis!

20:18.551 --> 20:20.594
[monster shrieking]

20:26.434 --> 20:32.314
Yeah! Yeah! Get zapped!
Oh, get zapped by the zap hand!

20:32.398 --> 20:33.899
My zap hand! Yeah!

20:33.983 --> 20:35.735
Can you be astounded later?

20:35.818 --> 20:40.072
Right! Uh, Rayla, finishing move.
You got this! Slash!

20:43.451 --> 20:44.493
[yelps]

20:45.661 --> 20:46.871
-Rayla!
-No!

20:51.041 --> 20:52.042
[monster shrieking]

20:56.547 --> 20:58.299
[Rayla panting] That was too close.

21:00.676 --> 21:04.054
If that thing was a split-second faster,
I would have been...

21:06.599 --> 21:09.894
[groaning] Help! Help me!

21:10.478 --> 21:11.687
Aspiro!

21:17.234 --> 21:18.235
[Callum] Yes!

21:18.319 --> 21:20.321
[chuckling] How 'bout that?

21:20.404 --> 21:22.156
I knew "whoosh" should have been
part of the plan.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.163
[footsteps approaching]

21:38.839 --> 21:42.426
Enough brooding, elf.
My patience wears thin.

21:42.968 --> 21:48.098
Tell me what you know about this relic
or I will seal your fate.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.438
You have succeeded.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.357
Oh, have I?

21:57.399 --> 22:02.154
That mirror? You have found something
worse than death.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.115
Then, tell me. What is it?

22:05.199 --> 22:08.035
I will never help you.

22:08.118 --> 22:11.038
Then you are of no use to me.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.170
[chanting]

22:23.801 --> 22:25.219
[Runaan grunting]

22:27.638 --> 22:30.182
-[whistling]
-[chanting continues]

22:32.059 --> 22:33.143
[Runaan screaming]

22:35.980 --> 22:38.023
[chanting and screaming continue]

22:42.528 --> 22:43.529
[screaming stops]

22:51.328 --> 22:52.371
[gasps]

22:58.961 --> 23:02.214
I always seem to capture
the same expression.

23:02.298 --> 23:07.595
Defiance, giving way to absolute fear.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.813
Look! Up there! That's the tree!

23:19.607 --> 23:22.943
Yes, we're almost there!
We can do this, team.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.236
We can make it to the rim!

23:24.320 --> 23:26.488
We're going to find the healer
and save the egg.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.950
[Ava whimpers]

23:31.118 --> 23:33.287
-Oh, no.
-[Callum] What is it?

23:34.413 --> 23:38.709
I have really bad news.
I don't know how to tell you.

23:38.792 --> 23:39.627
Just say it.

23:40.252 --> 23:44.089
Even if we make it to the rim,
it doesn't matter.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.675
There is no miracle healer.
