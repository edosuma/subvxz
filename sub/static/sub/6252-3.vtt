once I removed the scalp,
subscapular hemorrhaging was apparent.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.356

two injuries to the head.

22:16.461 --> 22:18.497
- I won’t breathe a word.
- Okay.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.204
I’m just so happy.
This is so great, Angela. |— Oh—

22:21.299 --> 22:22.789
What is?

22:25.803 --> 22:28.385
That she is—

22:28.473 --> 22:31.965
That I— I have a, uh—

22:32.060 --> 22:35.302
I have a database of concrete items
that can kill someone.

22:35.396 --> 22:38.354
And today is the first day
that I can use it.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.477
So I am o-over the moon.

22:40.568 --> 22:44.231
Yes. And you shouldn’t
disturb her, Mr. Fisher.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.904
I wanted to give you
the measurements of the injuries.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.445
The dispersal of fracturing—
Great.

22:49.536 --> 22:50.901
Great. Fantastic.

22:50.995 --> 22:54.783
And I’ll go... away now.

23:00.922 --> 23:04.835
I just can’t get as stoked
about work as you guys can.

23:06.511 --> 23:07.842

Yo, what’s up? Yeah.

Ho, ho, wait. The list.

F.B.|., okay?
We’re here about a murder. Listen.

23:21.943 --> 23:24.980
The victim was here
at this establishment with this guy.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.153
Uh, is he here tonight?

23:28.491 --> 23:30.698
Oh, yeah.
He’s right there. See? Him.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.992
No, no. Him.

23:33.121 --> 23:34.827
Him?
Okay, you know what?

23:34.914 --> 23:37.075
We’ll go scope the place out

JJ [ Louo’ Techno]

23:41.713 --> 23:43.874
[Whooping ]

23:50.555 --> 23:52.546
Notice the two
unpaired females.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.131
Their body movements
and attire...

23:55.268 --> 23:57.509
suggest they are
available for mating.
Bones, we’re looking for Peppy.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.761
Oh. Over there.
Where? Peppy?

23:59.856 --> 24:02.563
No. No. Two males
have spotted
the available females...

24:02.650 --> 24:04.515
and will approach them
and begin the exhibition.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.519
Fascinating.
Fascinating?
More like pitiful.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.570
Now the males are displaying
their musculature,

24:09.657 --> 24:11.648
indicating
they are good breeders.

24:13.036 --> 24:15.698
This activity shows
that these two will soon mate...

24:15.788 --> 24:18.746
and the other suitors
will continue their search elsewhere.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.245
Just remember,
we’re here looking for Peppy.

24:21.336 --> 24:23.372
Excuse me. F.B.I.

Uh-uh.

Get off me!

24:57.413 --> 24:59.404
This posturing is called
“throwing the crab.”

24:59.499 --> 25:01.535
It will intimidate him
into compliance.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.960
[ Booth ]
What was that about?

25:10.051 --> 25:12.167
These idiots think ice
is free, and it’s not.

25:12.261 --> 25:15.173
They’re always in my way.
They never let me do my job.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.220
Look, I gotta account
for every single cube.

25:17.308 --> 25:20.721
Ice is frozen water, yo.
Water’s free. Do the math, dipstick.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.266
Put on some lip gloss, Mary.
I will, ’cause your mother
likes my lips soft.

25:24.357 --> 25:27.770
- Oh, he’s suggesting
that he had sex with his mother.
- Right. Got that, Bones.

Steroid freak.
Who’s the one who
goes ballistic over water?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.566
Like you even know
what “ballistic” means.

25:32.657 --> 25:34.568
You can go home now.
Come on. Go.

25:34.659 --> 25:37.071
Ballistic, as in referring
to “from the balls.”

25:37.161 --> 25:39.277
No. That’s not even close
to an accurate definition.

25:39.372 --> 25:41.738
Ballistic refers
to projectile in flight.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.369
So can I make like a ballistic now?

25:43.459 --> 25:45.245
No, you cannot make
like a ballistic now,

25:45.336 --> 25:47.668
because you were the last person
who saw Ritchie Genaro alive.

25:47.755 --> 25:51.247
Seriously, yo? Ritchie was my boy.
How am I gonna kill my boy?

25:51.342 --> 25:53.719
- Knocking him over the head.
- You don’t seem very upset.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.339
It’s killing me.

25:55.430 --> 25:57.466
But I gotta keep on for Ritchie.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.468
He would’ve wanted me to keep on.
You feel me?

25:59.559 --> 26:00.890
He’s asking
if you understand.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.218
So his mother says you guys
were doing steroids.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.303
One cycle.
That was all for Ritchie.

26:05.398 --> 26:08.390
And I don’t use roids— not anymore.
Ritchie got me off ’em.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.270
Proved they would shrink my ballistics.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.818
So Ritchie only did
anabolic steroids once?

26:12.905 --> 26:15.237
His mother would kill him,
like for real.

26:15.324 --> 26:18.191
Can you think of anyone
who’d wanna kill Ritchie
besides his mother?

26:20.329 --> 26:22.194
His stalker.

26:22.331 --> 26:25.243
This stalker have a name?
I don’t know her name.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.370
I didn’t see her here tonight.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.243
I could describe her.
Okay.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.000
She got dark hair, dark skin, big hair.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.422
Like everybody
in this club.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.795
Would Ritchie’s stalker
be aggressive enough...

26:35.887 --> 26:39.971
to strike him over the head hard enough
to force his skull down over his spine?

26:40.057 --> 26:41.433

27:02.663 --> 27:04.199
[ Commotion Continues]

27:06.125 --> 27:08.411
Okay, comparing
the concrete sample...

27:08.503 --> 27:10.664
to the injuries
on the victim’s skull,

27:10.755 --> 27:14.088
the weapon appears
to have a curved edge.

27:14.175 --> 27:16.291
Okay, completing the arc.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.092
The murder weapon
was some sort
of concrete cylinder?

27:19.180 --> 27:22.263
With a 3.175-centimeter
diameter.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.810
Like a plumbing pipe.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.431
Yeah, or a tetherball pole.

27:27.522 --> 27:29.012
It’s so random, yo.

[ Sweets ]
While I was studying
all the text messages,

27:46.624 --> 27:50.162
I created this overview
of what Dr. Brennan calls “the tribe,”

27:50.253 --> 27:52.335
seen through digital lines
of communication.

27:52.463 --> 27:55.546
This is our victim.
Ritchie “The V.”
He texted all these women?

27:55.633 --> 27:58.170
And these are women
who texted other men.

27:58.261 --> 28:00.502
Oh, it’s like a jealousy map.
Good work.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.006
Thank you.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.680
So look at what I stumbled across.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.803
A week before
the victim was murdered,

28:06.894 --> 28:10.011
over 200 texts were exchanged
between the victim...

28:10.106 --> 28:12.973
and a woman
named Marie Galasso.

28:13.067 --> 28:14.147
Hmm.

28:14.235 --> 28:15.725
Arrow, slash, three?

28:15.820 --> 28:17.606
Oh, that means
a broken heart.

28:17.697 --> 28:21.155
“M-I-2-M-2-H—6y?”

28:21.242 --> 28:23.358
“Am I too much
to handle, sexy?”

28:23.452 --> 28:26.285
So they were together once,
and she expected more.

28:26.372 --> 28:31.207
“Y-R-N-T-U-D46?”
“Why aren’t you down for sex?”

28:31.294 --> 28:34.206
And then there’s this one.
“2-G-2-B-4G.”

28:34.297 --> 28:36.333
“Too good to be forgotten.”

28:36.424 --> 28:38.335
So this is where
it gets really ugly.

28:38.426 --> 28:40.838
Ritchie texts Marie
that she was just a grenade.

A grenade?

A grenade is an ovenNeight,

with a prettier girl.

And this really set Marie off.

some of which I had to look up.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.813
Sounds like motive to me.
Yeah, and after that,

28:57.945 --> 29:01.813
Ritchie texts his friends
wherever he’s headed
to find out if she’s gonna be there.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.899

Did you find him
with another woman?

29:39.779 --> 29:44.398

Okay, “I ain’t sayin’ nothin’”
means you’re guilty.

No, I ain’t sayin’ nothin’
not ’cause I’m guilty.

I ain’t not sayin’ nothin’
because I loved him.

I loved Ritchie,
and he loved me, okay?
I’m notjust some shore whore.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.370
We had plans. And Ritchie,
he wasn’t just some guido.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.952
Okay? He was going to school
to be a therapist.

29:58.047 --> 30:00.584
He was gonna do stuff
and be somebody and like that.

30:00.675 --> 30:03.792

maybe wanted him quiet.

I hear that you asked Hannah
to move in with you.

31:25.426 --> 31:27.087

31:27.219 --> 31:29.301

No.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.057
It might help Angela
narrow down the murder weapon.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.513
Okay.
[ Stifled Yawn ]

33:06.944 --> 33:08.275
[Sighs]

33:08.362 --> 33:10.478
So when Ritchie
ratted out Terror
for selling drugs,

33:10.573 --> 33:12.859
he lost his job at the gym,
all of his clients.

33:12.992 --> 33:15.199
It was a mess.
Can I help you?

33:15.286 --> 33:18.323
Yeah, why don’t you tell us
what happened between
you and your buddy Ritchie.

33:18.414 --> 33:20.780
I’m guessing it
didn’t go very well,
since he’s dead.

33:20.875 --> 33:22.365
I don’t have to say nothin’,

33:22.459 --> 33:24.165
and I’m the doorman
of this establishment,

33:24.253 --> 33:26.369
so I’m gonna
ask you guys to leave.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.590
I wouldn’t be acting
like a bouncer right now.

33:28.674 --> 33:32.383
- Booth, the storage room.
- Hey, hey, hey. No.

33:32.469 --> 33:34.334
Did you just
shove my partner?

33:34.430 --> 33:36.887
Ah, you’re real bad
with a gun and a badge.

33:36.974 --> 33:40.387
But you won’t always be on duty.
You know what I’m sayin’?

33:40.477 --> 33:42.183
No, I don’t know what you’re saying.
Spell it out for me.

33:42.271 --> 33:46.139
I mean... watch your back.

33:46.233 --> 33:49.942
Oh, no, you shouldn’t
threaten Agent Booth.
He can be very male.

33:50.029 --> 33:52.486
I don’t like walking around
looking over my shoulder, huh?

33:52.573 --> 33:55.565
So what do you say
we do this right now? Hmm?

33:59.288 --> 34:01.779
[Sighs ] All right, l-I-listen.

34:01.874 --> 34:05.037
My boss holds me responsible
for everything in that storage room.

34:05.127 --> 34:07.118
I wasn’t looking for trouble.

34:07.213 --> 34:09.625
You’re not looking for trouble?
He’s not looking for trouble.

34:09.715 --> 34:14.254
Which means you are
giving Bones permission
to go look in the storage room.

34:14.345 --> 34:16.336
Thank you, Bones.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.138
[Sighs]

34:23.270 --> 34:24.806
- Booth.
- Yeah.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.138
Look.
Yellow plastic in concrete.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.323
Fine, whatever.

34:38.410 --> 34:41.652
Yeah, Ritchie ratted on me
and I was pissed. But I didn’t kill him.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.703
Is this really necessary?

34:43.832 --> 34:46.118
Then where were you
last Thursday night?
At work.

34:46.210 --> 34:49.043
- Nah, you weren’t at work.
- I didn’t kill Ritchie “The V.”

34:49.129 --> 34:50.790
Where were you?

34:52.383 --> 34:56.797
You know, if I were you,
I’d plead roid rage.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.718
I got an alibi.

34:58.806 --> 35:01.172
You can’tjust have an alibi.
You gotta share it with the world.

35:02.601 --> 35:06.014
I took my ma up to New York
to see Billy Elliot.

35:07.398 --> 35:09.935
- Billy Elliot?
- Yeah, the boy that dances, yeah.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.186
You like musicals?

35:12.278 --> 35:15.111
That’s why
I wasn’t forthcoming about my alibi.

35:15.197 --> 35:17.984
There’s some joys in life
you wanna keep to yourself.

35:18.075 --> 35:20.031
B/i/y Elliot is a joy?

35:20.119 --> 35:22.110
It’s beautiful, dude.

35:22.204 --> 35:24.786
- The boy is an angel.
- Right.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.829
I’m gonna find somebody
who knows the show,

35:26.917 --> 35:29.624
and you’re gonna tell it
to them— the whole story,

35:29.712 --> 35:32.704
Then we’ll see if you really saw
Billy Elliot with your mother.

35:32.798 --> 35:36.757
Oh, I can perform
the whole thing, word for word.

35:42.850 --> 35:46.638
This plastic sliver is curved,
just like the minute-crete was.

35:46.729 --> 35:49.015
They look pretty close.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.642
Oh, so close.

35:50.733 --> 35:52.689
[ Hodgins ]
Okay, both fragments
were in the skull wound.

35:52.776 --> 35:55.267
But how did they get there
if they weren’t part
of the same weapon?

35:55.362 --> 35:56.943
Yeah, that’s
a good question.

35:57.031 --> 36:00.398
Well, since the plastic
doesn’t fit inside the circle,

36:00.492 --> 36:02.824
how about trying it
on the outside?

36:02.911 --> 36:05.118
- Okay. That worked.
- [ Hodgins ] Yeah.

36:05.205 --> 36:07.161
All right, great.
Then what did we just find out?

36:07.249 --> 36:09.706
- Plastic covered cement.
- Concrete.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.375
I’m just being precise.

36:12.463 --> 36:15.830
Cement is the ingredient in concrete
that keeps everything, you know, together.

36:15.924 --> 36:18.631
Right. Uh, right, like—

36:22.139 --> 36:25.097
[ Groans ]
I totally suck.

36:29.855 --> 36:33.564
Terror told the whole story of Billy Elliot.
He even teared up a couple of times.

36:33.650 --> 36:37.142
Well, it is a touching story
of triumph over background
and adversity.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.319
Well, his mom
even backed him up.
They even have receipts.

36:39.448 --> 36:41.905
You don’t think he did it.
The timeline doesn’t even add up.

36:41.992 --> 36:43.368
Let’s sit over here.

36:43.452 --> 36:46.034
Ritchie’s friends say
that he disappeared
on Thursday, right?

36:46.121 --> 36:47.861
_ SO—
- Go on.

36:47.956 --> 36:50.743
And the body was found buried
in the sand the next Monday.

36:50.834 --> 36:54.122
Cam and Hodgins say
that the body only took
two days to decompose.

36:54.213 --> 36:55.999
Exactly. So either
they’re wrong or—

36:56.090 --> 36:57.455
Two days remain
unaccounted for.

36:57.591 --> 36:59.752
Look, the squints
could’ve gotten it wrong.
Mm-mmm.

36:59.885 --> 37:03.173
Mm-mmm.
What is— Don’t do that.
Don’t do that.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.639
What?

two days went missing.

[Cell Phone Beeping ]
l have to call Fisher.

37:12.815 --> 37:15.022
What are you doing?
[ Exhales ]

37:15.109 --> 37:17.270
Dr. Brennan had
some kind of a brainstorm,

37:17.403 --> 37:20.315
and it looks like
she was right.
You say that like it’s bad news.

37:20.447 --> 37:23.280
I should have
thought of it.
Okay.

37:23.367 --> 37:25.028
First, tell me the brainstorm.

37:25.119 --> 37:28.486
Note the microfractures
in the haversian canals.

37:28.622 --> 37:31.659
Yes. From a blow to the skull?
These are
from the victim’s femur.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.366
The victim was frozen
for two days.

37:34.503 --> 37:37.711
That’s what caused
the microfractures.
[Yawning ]

37:37.798 --> 37:40.790
No, why are you yawning?
Are you depre— Don’t yawn.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.420
I suck.

37:42.511 --> 37:44.843
How long ago did Dr. Brennan
have her brainstorm?

37:46.348 --> 37:48.259
About 45 minutes ago.

37:48.350 --> 37:52.138
So basically,
you’re 45 minutes behind...

37:52.229 --> 37:55.471
arguably the greatest
forensic anthropologist in the nation.

37:57.276 --> 38:00.018
That’s... one way
to look at it, but—

38:00.112 --> 38:03.149
Look, I’m not a psychiatrist,
but it seems to me...

38:03.240 --> 38:05.276
that when your shrink says
look on the bright side,

38:05.367 --> 38:07.699
he means give yourself
the benefit of the doubt.

38:09.997 --> 38:12.534
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:16.128 --> 38:18.915
- The victim was killed and then frozen?
- Apparently.

38:19.006 --> 38:20.871
- Put on ice?
- Metaphorically speaking.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.422
Or not.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.750
What do you—
What do you mean “or not”?

38:24.845 --> 38:27.507
What? What did I miss?

38:27.598 --> 38:29.008
No, what did I miss?

38:31.059 --> 38:33.596
[Yawning]

38:35.230 --> 38:38.142
Studies have shown
that when frozen properly,

38:38.233 --> 38:40.224
a body’s cell deterioration stops...

38:40.319 --> 38:42.981
and can be held in that state
nearly indefinitely.

38:43.071 --> 38:45.107
But in order
to avoid microfractures,

38:45.199 --> 38:48.111
when a person wants
to be preserved cryogenically,
they need to be flash frozen.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.325
I get it, Bones.
I should have seen it earlier,

38:50.412 --> 38:53.324
because when a body
is frozen slowly,

38:53.457 --> 38:56.244
- the decomposition rate speeds up
as the body thaws.

It was his roommate.

They were wearing
the same shirt.

You and Peppy are hollering
at each other. He takes off.

39:17.606 --> 39:18.971
You see Ritchie
in the same shirt.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.681
Maybe you threatened him
with your Wiffle bat.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.687
He doesn’t know the bat’s
filled with cement. He comes at you.

39:22.778 --> 39:25.190
- You hit him twice.
- Then you put him on ice for two days.

39:25.280 --> 39:28.818
- Then you bury him at the beach.
- I’m just trying to make a living.

to be overrun by these morons?

You know, Peppy,
he’s a real douche.

coming to him down the line.

Ritchie was a good guy.

for a good time up at the Jersey shore.
