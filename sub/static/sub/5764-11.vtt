00:02.941 --> 00:04.608
Hello? Ned: Hey, is this sonja?

00:04.675 --> 00:06.042
Yeah, who is this?

00:06.110 --> 00:07.645
Ned and noah from the "ned and noah show"

00:07.713 --> 00:10.992
On wqry campus radio.
How's it going tonight?

00:11.059 --> 00:13.916
Actually, I'm sort of
cramming for a midterm.

00:13.984 --> 00:15.779
So what's up?

00:15.847 --> 00:18.448
Well, we have your boyfriend
aaron here in studio with us.

00:18.516 --> 00:19.993
Hey, sonja.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.647
Aaron?

00:21.715 --> 00:23.796
What are you up to now?

00:23.864 --> 00:25.402
He has something he wants to tell you.

00:25.470 --> 00:27.147
Is it ok if we broadcast your conversation?

00:27.215 --> 00:28.215
I guess.

00:28.283 --> 00:29.281
But what's going on?

00:29.349 --> 00:30.738
Don't worry, sonja.

00:30.805 --> 00:32.000
We've got two ticketsto seey

00:32.067 --> 00:33.598
Ifou'll just hear him out.

00:33.665 --> 00:35.236
Ok. Cool.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.444
Oh, you guys are lifesavers.

00:37.514 --> 00:39.051
This estate auction just
popped up out of nowhere.

00:39.118 --> 00:41.458
Hey, free wine, I'm yours.

00:41.528 --> 00:42.731
Hey, which station is he on?

00:42.799 --> 00:45.407
Um, wqry,

00:45.475 --> 00:46.982
88.1.

00:47.050 --> 00:48.957
Oh, my god, we missed the beginning.

00:49.025 --> 00:50.632
I am a terrible mother.

00:50.699 --> 00:52.269
Since when does ned have a radio show?

00:52.337 --> 00:53.776
Since he took that broadcast arts elective

00:53.843 --> 00:55.583
And his professor liked him so much

00:55.651 --> 00:57.488
That she gave him the six to midnight shift.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.661
There it is.

00:58.729 --> 00:59.798
Aaron, man, if you want those tickets,

00:59.866 --> 01:01.235
You better get to the point.

01:01.303 --> 01:02.841
Aaron, what do you mean
you're not coming home?

01:02.909 --> 01:04.510
Go on, aaron, tell her.

01:04.580 --> 01:06.883
He sounds good, doesn't he?
The next howard stern.

01:06.951 --> 01:08.252
She needs to hear it from you
before she finds out the hard way.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.581
I want to break-up.

01:09.649 --> 01:11.349
It's over.

01:11.417 --> 01:12.716
Is this a joke?

01:12.783 --> 01:13.882
Sorry, sonj, it's just,

01:13.949 --> 01:15.719
There's no other way to say it.

01:15.787 --> 01:17.088
What kind of a show is this?

01:17.156 --> 01:20.328
Wait a minute, you're dumping me,

01:20.396 --> 01:21.765
On a radio show,

01:21.833 --> 01:23.903
For some concert tickets?

01:23.970 --> 01:25.472
Well, you get two ticks, too.

01:25.540 --> 01:27.610
On the other side of the arena, of course.

01:27.678 --> 01:29.113
Who the hell is she?

01:29.181 --> 01:31.117
Yeah, aaron. Who's the lucky girl?

01:31.185 --> 01:33.455
Sonja, there's no one else.

01:33.523 --> 01:35.459
That's not what you told us.
You said you met her at some party.

01:35.527 --> 01:38.867
The party at doozy's house? When I was sick?

01:38.935 --> 01:40.136
Ding ding ding. Go on, aaron.

01:40.204 --> 01:41.472
No name, no tickets.

01:41.540 --> 01:43.612
Ok, ok. It's lisa.

01:43.679 --> 01:44.813
What?!

01:44.881 --> 01:49.547
That skank you work with at copy town?!

01:49.615 --> 01:50.783
Oh.

01:50.850 --> 01:53.655
That's really great, aaron.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.290
You know what, you deserve

01:55.358 --> 01:57.127
Whatever disease she gives you.

01:57.194 --> 02:00.198
I can't believe you're doing this
to me on a freaking radio show.

02:00.266 --> 02:03.270
Ok, sonja, hang on a sec.

02:03.338 --> 02:04.572
Hello? Hello?

02:04.641 --> 02:06.978
Hello? I think we lost her.

02:10.285 --> 02:12.387
That's supposed to be entertainment?

02:12.455 --> 02:13.957
I guess these days it is.

02:14.024 --> 02:15.592
That was pretty horrible. Yeah.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.327
No wonder he never wants
me to listen to his show.

02:17.395 --> 02:18.796
I can't even believe he thinks that's funny.

02:18.864 --> 02:20.733
What has happened to him?

02:20.800 --> 02:22.101
Well, he went to college.

02:22.169 --> 02:23.571
That poor girl. She seemed so upset.

02:24.039 --> 02:25.207
Or she's a pretty good actress.

02:25.275 --> 02:26.275
You think she was faking it?

02:26.343 --> 02:27.543
It was probably a joke.

02:27.611 --> 02:28.845
They were probably all in on it.

02:28.913 --> 02:30.715
Yeah, well, still,
I think it's mean-spirited.

02:30.783 --> 02:32.217
It's one thing for him to be getting

02:32.285 --> 02:33.853
A perfectly useless degree

02:33.920 --> 02:35.889
In the occult sciences, and another thing

02:35.957 --> 02:37.225
For him to be wasting all his time on this.

02:37.292 --> 02:39.094
Um, I agree.

02:39.162 --> 02:42.599
But it's actually
anthropology of the occult.

02:42.667 --> 02:45.069
And it's not totally useless.

02:45.137 --> 02:47.540
Especially if we want to find
out what's up with the shadows.

02:47.607 --> 02:49.342
No, I know, I am sorry.

02:49.410 --> 02:52.113
I--how is aiden doing with all of that?

02:52.181 --> 02:53.715
He seems over it.

02:53.783 --> 02:56.386
Like his visions, I mean,
he's just laughing and playing

02:56.454 --> 02:57.821
And I'm worrying.

02:57.889 --> 02:59.757
Yeah, well, I get that.

02:59.825 --> 03:02.327
I swear, I don't even know
who my kid is anymore.

03:02.395 --> 03:04.430
Like I said, he went to college.

03:04.498 --> 03:07.067
Yeah, but that doesn't give him an out.

03:07.135 --> 03:09.470
He almost never calls me back.

03:09.538 --> 03:12.108
He thinks a quality conversation
is when he texts me something

03:12.175 --> 03:14.244
That's more than a sentence long.

03:14.311 --> 03:15.745
And when I finally do get to see him,

03:15.813 --> 03:17.781
He's always with some new girl.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.085
You think maybe that's the
real reason you're upset?

03:21.754 --> 03:25.125
I'm upset because I taught
him to be better than this.

03:25.192 --> 03:26.226
Hey, delia,

03:26.294 --> 03:27.728
It was probably just a joke, you know?

03:27.796 --> 03:29.630
He'll be all right.

03:32.034 --> 03:34.470
I know.

03:36.207 --> 03:37.274
Thanks for listening.

03:37.341 --> 03:39.076
Be sure to tune in again tomorrow night.

03:39.144 --> 03:41.011
And here's a tune to sign us off.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.752
You were awesome.

03:48.655 --> 03:51.691
I knew my theater major
would come in handy someday.

03:51.759 --> 03:53.527
Are you still free later?

03:53.595 --> 03:56.597
Hmm, I can clear my busschedule.

03:56.665 --> 03:59.201
Excuse me. I want to talk
to whoever's responsible

03:59.269 --> 04:01.003
For that show tonight.

04:01.071 --> 04:02.471
I guess that would be me.

04:02.539 --> 04:04.073
Well, then you should
be ashamed of yourself.

04:04.141 --> 04:05.841
Do you have any idea the
pain you are causing people

04:05.909 --> 04:07.475
With stunts like that?

04:07.543 --> 04:08.976
It was just a harmless prank.

04:09.044 --> 04:11.944
There is nothing harmless about
destroying people's lives,

04:12.012 --> 04:13.045
To what, what, get a laugh?

04:13.112 --> 04:15.379
Everything you kids said tonight,
everything,

04:15.447 --> 04:16.579
That's what happened to me!

04:16.648 --> 04:18.682
But we made it all up.

04:18.749 --> 04:20.182
Oh, the party at doozy's?

04:20.250 --> 04:21.350
That was my story!

04:21.416 --> 04:23.785
I had a really good marriage,

04:23.853 --> 04:25.186
And then I got a phone
call just like that one.

04:26.822 --> 04:28.757
What, you think this is funny,
humiliating people?

04:28.758 --> 04:30.361
Listen, m'am, it was a joke.

04:30.429 --> 04:32.230
What, you thi'm sorryis funny,
humiliating if we offended you.

04:32.298 --> 04:33.431
No, you're not.

04:33.499 --> 04:36.233
Because that would require a conscience,

04:36.301 --> 04:39.036
Which obviously none of you kids have.

04:42.406 --> 04:44.873
Well, that was random.

04:46.242 --> 04:49.443
Where'd you guys get the
idea for that, anyway?

04:49.511 --> 04:51.411
Yeah, no, ned wrote it.

04:51.479 --> 04:52.779
I thought you wrote it.

04:53.980 --> 04:56.280
It was on the computer
with the song playlist

04:56.348 --> 04:57.982
And the other pranks.

05:04.754 --> 05:07.923
oh, my god!

05:07.991 --> 05:09.859
What's going on here?!

05:09.927 --> 05:11.728
Noah, dude, you're bleeding.

05:16.768 --> 05:18.768
What the...

05:20.000 --> 05:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:27.777 --> 05:29.310
What was that?

05:29.378 --> 05:32.480
I wish I could tell you.

05:34.016 --> 05:35.917
Child, whispering: Can you see us?

05:35.985 --> 05:44.986
Sync by honeybunny

06:07.866 --> 06:10.334
Non-fat double mocha for you.

06:10.402 --> 06:12.102
Americano with shaved carob for you.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.403
Great minds...

06:13.471 --> 06:15.237
Thank you. I need the caffeine.

06:15.305 --> 06:16.772
I didn't sleep last night.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.907
I kept thinking about--

06:18.975 --> 06:20.875
Hey. I brought coffee.

06:20.943 --> 06:23.911
The evil entity that
took over my son's body.

06:23.979 --> 06:25.379
Well, you're welcome.

06:25.446 --> 06:27.046
We listened to your show.

06:27.114 --> 06:30.283
Show? More like a public flogging.

06:30.351 --> 06:32.519
I'm glad you liked it.
It's not real, you know.

06:32.586 --> 06:34.019
We were ad-libbing off of an old script.

06:34.087 --> 06:35.787
Maybe, but it was still mean.

06:35.855 --> 06:40.091
I can't argue with that.
Somebody else thought so, too.

06:40.159 --> 06:41.225
Somebody dead.

06:41.293 --> 06:42.393
What happened?

06:42.461 --> 06:43.761
This woman, she was ranting about

06:43.829 --> 06:45.363
How a prank just like the one we did

06:45.431 --> 06:46.765
Ruined her marriage.

06:46.832 --> 06:48.666
Wait, you saw a ghost?

06:48.734 --> 06:50.134
No, she was alive.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.302
But as soon as she left,
the studio went nuts.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.371
Noah's ears started bleeding,
and then the word

06:54.439 --> 06:56.506
"killers" popped up on my laptop.

06:56.574 --> 06:58.208
We're pretty sure they didn't mean the band.

06:58.275 --> 06:59.942
And did you get the woman's name?

07:00.010 --> 07:01.577
She was way too busy yelling at us.

07:01.645 --> 07:03.045
Hold on.

07:03.113 --> 07:04.713
You're just diving in to help him?

07:04.781 --> 07:07.482
Mom, noah's ears were bleedings.

07:07.550 --> 07:09.317
So where did you get the idea for the prank?

07:09.384 --> 07:12.385
That's the thing. I thought
noah wrote it, he thought I did.

07:12.453 --> 07:13.652
It was jt there on our computer

07:13.720 --> 07:14.820
With the rest of the program

07:14.887 --> 07:16.654
For the broadcast.
Looked like an old transcript

07:16.722 --> 07:19.222
Of a stunt from when the
station was commercial.

07:19.290 --> 07:21.624
But all the names were sketched out.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.159
So maybe the ghost resurrected
it to torment this woman?

07:24.227 --> 07:27.761
Were these pranks staged back then,
or were they real?

07:27.829 --> 07:28.997
I think maybe both.

07:29.064 --> 07:30.499
I don't know, I've got noah going through

07:30.566 --> 07:31.966
All the old transcripts, but so far...

07:32.034 --> 07:33.301
Let's see.

07:33.369 --> 07:36.438
Wqry was a commercial station
until about six years ago.

07:36.506 --> 07:39.174
When the owner donated it to the university.

07:39.242 --> 07:41.008
I wonder if anybody was
killed because of that prank.

07:41.076 --> 07:42.609
Well, it wouldn't surprise me.

07:42.677 --> 07:43.810
Sounds like whatever set that woman off

07:43.878 --> 07:45.812
Might have stirred the ghost up, too.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.481
Hilarious, right?

07:47.548 --> 07:48.983
Ok, here's your first lead.

07:49.050 --> 07:51.151
The station's most popular show was

07:51.219 --> 07:52.852
"drivin' home," with dj dean olsen.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.854
Looks like he did telephone pranks, too.

07:54.922 --> 07:56.222
Where is he now?

07:56.290 --> 07:57.856
It says he abruptly quit at the height

07:57.924 --> 07:59.824
Of his popularity about eight years ago,

07:59.892 --> 08:00.892
But doesn't say why.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.794
Probably moved to a bigger market.

08:02.861 --> 08:04.262
No.

08:04.329 --> 08:05.930
Not exactly.

08:10.334 --> 08:11.434
Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Jeez.

08:11.502 --> 08:12.736
We're here.

08:24.512 --> 08:26.846
You sure this is the right place?

08:26.914 --> 08:29.015
I found it on the penthius satellite map.

08:29.083 --> 08:32.385
It's a camper in the woods

08:39.192 --> 08:40.826
Excuse me.

08:42.028 --> 08:43.861
Hello?

08:45.765 --> 08:47.599
Hello?

08:56.907 --> 08:59.508
Aah! Don't-- don't do that!

08:59.575 --> 09:01.111
Sorry. We were hoping

09:01.178 --> 09:02.512
To talk to you about your radio show.

09:02.580 --> 09:03.513
What?

09:03.580 --> 09:05.612
It's about wqry.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.281
Wonder why what?

09:07.349 --> 09:08.682
Wqry?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.516
We need to talk to you.

09:10.584 --> 09:14.052
Sorry. I forget these are in sometimes.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.054
All right, what's this about?

09:16.121 --> 09:17.621
Your show on wqry.

09:17.688 --> 09:21.256
Yeah, well, if you're fans, get over it.

09:21.324 --> 09:22.591
Show's over.

09:22.659 --> 09:24.092
I spent the past eight years of my life

09:24.160 --> 09:27.195
Trying to get away from it, so...

09:27.263 --> 09:28.763
'cause strange things have been happening?

09:30.265 --> 09:31.465
Like things you can't explain?

09:32.666 --> 09:34.300
Who are you?

09:34.368 --> 09:36.602
Yeah, we must have done
thousands of those calls.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.671
I don't-- I don't remember every single one.

09:38.739 --> 09:41.174
Husbands leaving wives for another woman,

09:41.242 --> 09:43.276
Wife leaving for another man,

09:43.344 --> 09:45.945
Husbands leaving for another man.

09:46.013 --> 09:48.080
Yeah, your angry lady could be anybody.

09:48.148 --> 09:50.148
The calls you did back then,
were they real or staged?

09:50.216 --> 09:51.549
A little bit of both.

09:51.617 --> 09:52.817
Even when the callers were in on it,

09:52.885 --> 09:54.852
You never knew what might come popping out.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.620
So if it was real,

09:56.688 --> 09:58.021
This lady's husband must have dumped her

09:58.089 --> 09:59.890
On your show for another woman. Yeah.

09:59.957 --> 10:01.758
Which narrows it down to a gazillion.

10:01.825 --> 10:03.026
Only this time, somebody died.

10:03.093 --> 10:04.727
Died?

10:04.795 --> 10:06.662
And we're guessing they're blaming you.

10:06.730 --> 10:09.664
How could a dead person be blaming...

10:11.300 --> 10:14.102
So, wait, are we talking ghosts here?

10:14.170 --> 10:16.237
Yeah, we are.

10:18.006 --> 10:19.706
So it's real?

10:19.774 --> 10:21.441
Everything that's been happening to me,

10:21.509 --> 10:23.410
It's real? I'm not-- I'm not crazy!

10:23.478 --> 10:25.378
No. You're haunted.

10:25.446 --> 10:28.447
By someone you rubbed the
wrong way on the radio.

10:29.816 --> 10:32.217
Can you tell us how it started? Yeah.

10:32.285 --> 10:33.452
The same way you said happened to you.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.187
The board just went haywire.

10:35.254 --> 10:37.255
It kept playing the same song over and over.

10:37.323 --> 10:39.257
"in my place" by coldplay.

10:39.324 --> 10:40.791
Hey, how did you know?!

10:40.859 --> 10:43.627
Ok, so, yeah, ok, it is real. It's just,

10:43.694 --> 10:45.128
Even after I left the station,

10:45.196 --> 10:47.797
Everywhere that had a speaker

10:47.865 --> 10:51.066
Or electricity would play that song!

10:51.134 --> 10:52.301
Is that why you're not
hooked up to any power?

10:52.368 --> 10:54.002
Why you've been camping out

10:54.070 --> 10:55.103
For the last eight years?

10:55.171 --> 10:56.270
You wanted to get off the grid?

10:56.338 --> 10:57.405
Can you imagine what it's like

10:57.472 --> 10:58.939
To go without music,

10:59.007 --> 11:02.242
When it used to be my whole life?

11:02.310 --> 11:03.743
Look...

11:03.811 --> 11:05.778
We can help you.

11:05.845 --> 11:07.846
We can get this ghost to leave you alone.

11:07.914 --> 11:10.415
But we've got to find the woman
who came to the studio last night.

11:10.483 --> 11:12.450
I'd love to help you, believe me,

11:12.518 --> 11:14.418
But we've had a lot of cds.

11:14.486 --> 11:15.853
Compact discs?

11:15.920 --> 11:17.454
No, collateral damage.

11:17.522 --> 11:18.922
People who get caught in the crossfire.

11:18.989 --> 11:20.423
But no one who actually died.

11:20.491 --> 11:21.491
That you know of.

11:26.562 --> 11:29.230
It's happening to you now.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.866
And it won't stop.

11:32.935 --> 11:35.803
It never stops!

11:35.871 --> 11:37.905
You have to leave! Get out of here! Go!

11:37.972 --> 11:39.272
Leave!

11:39.340 --> 11:40.741
Please leave!

11:45.780 --> 11:48.481
Aiden, remember how mommy told
you that if you make a mess,

11:48.549 --> 11:49.948
You have to clean it up?

11:50.016 --> 11:52.150
Why are toys a mess?

11:52.218 --> 11:54.819
Because they're all over the living room.

11:54.887 --> 11:56.954
Come on, let's get these upstairs.

11:57.022 --> 11:59.857
And then you can finish your drawing.

12:02.926 --> 12:05.427
Aiden, did you hear me?

12:07.630 --> 12:09.197
What's wrong?

12:09.265 --> 12:11.432
You're bleeding.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.500
What?

12:15.970 --> 12:17.404
Oh.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.372
Oh, well, you know what, baby? It's ok.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.208
Right? Look at me, I'm ok.

12:34.051 --> 12:36.519
What are those?

12:39.589 --> 12:41.955
Daisies?

12:43.091 --> 12:45.191
It was his undoing.

12:45.259 --> 12:47.259
Who's?

13:00.871 --> 13:03.440
You're listening to the "ned and noah" show,

13:03.508 --> 13:05.443
Rockin' rock u. Till midnight.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.278
Tj, do you want to tell
us about the next song?

13:07.346 --> 13:10.616
Let's just say this one goes
out to someone pretty cool.

13:10.684 --> 13:13.752
I'm pretty sure that the
ghost had a violent death.

13:13.820 --> 13:16.254
There was blood and hair stuck in the glass.

13:16.321 --> 13:17.387
A head injury, maybe?

13:17.455 --> 13:19.588
Yeah, that would explain the hair.

13:19.655 --> 13:21.522
So the husband comes back

13:21.590 --> 13:23.691
After the radio prank,
and things get violent.

13:23.758 --> 13:24.825
But if she killed him,

13:24.893 --> 13:26.693
Why would she be here yelling at you?

13:26.761 --> 13:29.529
She said it was exactly like
what happened to her, right?

13:29.597 --> 13:31.197
So we're pretty sure her
husband went on the air

13:31.265 --> 13:32.732
And told her he's leaving
her for another woman.

13:32.799 --> 13:35.234
Daisy. No, thanks.

13:35.301 --> 13:37.268
Not my favorite flower. No, no, no.

13:37.336 --> 13:39.603
Aiden's picture. Maybe it wasn't a flower.

13:39.671 --> 13:40.704
Maybe it was a name.

13:40.772 --> 13:43.140
I mean, he said that it was his "undoing."

13:43.207 --> 13:46.609
Undoing? What 5-year-old says "undoing"?

13:46.677 --> 13:47.944
It was a vision dream thing, all right?

13:48.012 --> 13:50.012
Look, maybe she was the other woman.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.280
Or his wife.

13:51.348 --> 13:53.915
Ok, so the ghost is her husband,

13:53.983 --> 13:57.385
And he's angry because he thinks
that the radio show killed him?

13:57.453 --> 13:59.853
How? A head injury.

13:59.921 --> 14:01.755
Will you pay attention?

14:01.823 --> 14:03.223
How are you doing with those transcripts?

14:03.291 --> 14:04.658
I'm still looking.

14:04.725 --> 14:06.226
All the others ones have
participant's names,

14:06.293 --> 14:08.494
Phone numbers, so if we find it...

14:08.562 --> 14:09.495
If?

14:09.563 --> 14:10.696
The station's archives

14:10.764 --> 14:12.030
Are like the last scene from "raiders"--

14:12.098 --> 14:13.899
Miles and miles of boxes.

14:16.635 --> 14:17.969
Are you hearing this?

14:18.037 --> 14:20.304
It's the same song as before.

14:20.372 --> 14:21.438
Everybody... Second man: Has...

14:21.506 --> 14:22.606
Dirty... Third man: Laundry

14:22.674 --> 14:24.373
Fourth man: Even...

14:24.441 --> 14:26.441
Fifth man: Your host, ned banks.
What the hell?

14:26.509 --> 14:28.143
First man: Ned slept... Second man: With...

14:28.211 --> 14:30.479
Shut it off! I can't!

14:30.547 --> 14:31.480
Ned... Second man: Slept...

14:31.548 --> 14:32.481
Third man: With... Woman: Tj's...

14:32.549 --> 14:33.549
Second woman: Roommate.

14:39.021 --> 14:40.355
Ned?

14:43.091 --> 14:44.124
Is that true?

14:44.192 --> 14:45.659
I can explain.

14:45.727 --> 14:48.127
Save your breath.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.329
Tj, wait...

14:52.999 --> 14:54.466
Tj!

14:54.534 --> 14:55.467
Hold on!

14:55.535 --> 14:57.702
Oh!

14:57.770 --> 14:59.204
Ned!

14:59.271 --> 15:00.338
Ned!

15:00.406 --> 15:02.907
Funny, huh?

15:14.027 --> 15:15.062
jim! Where is he?

15:15.129 --> 15:16.129
Is he ok?

15:16.197 --> 15:17.497
Hey, he's fine, he's ok.

15:17.565 --> 15:18.765
We gave him a few stitches.

15:18.833 --> 15:20.333
No concussions, all right?

15:20.401 --> 15:22.468
Oh, well, that's good,
because I'm going to give him one.

15:24.837 --> 15:26.837
All right, I'm going to let you two talk--

15:26.905 --> 15:28.205
Quietly, please.

15:28.273 --> 15:30.173
And, ned,

15:30.241 --> 15:32.142
Be a little more careful out there, ok?

15:32.210 --> 15:34.377
I'm fine, mom.

15:34.444 --> 15:37.145
No, actually, you are anything

15:37.213 --> 15:39.313
But fine.

15:39.381 --> 15:40.614
I heard your show.

15:40.682 --> 15:42.082
Is it true?

15:42.150 --> 15:45.452
What that creepy voice said
about you and tj's roommate?

15:45.519 --> 15:47.854
Look, it's really no one's
business but mine and tj's.

15:47.921 --> 15:48.921
And her roommate's.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.990
What's gotten into you, ned? Nothing.

15:51.057 --> 15:52.224
We've been hanging out for a few weeks.

15:52.292 --> 15:53.458
It's not like we're a couple.

15:53.526 --> 15:55.293
Oh, does she think you are? No.

15:55.361 --> 15:57.095
I mean, I don't think so.

15:57.163 --> 15:58.930
How should I know?

15:58.998 --> 16:00.931
It doesn't even matter to you?

16:00.999 --> 16:02.933
You think it's just cool
to be hanging out with tj

16:03.001 --> 16:04.701
And then sleeping with her roommate?

16:04.769 --> 16:05.769
It was one time,

16:05.837 --> 16:06.870
And vivian didn't tell her, either.

16:06.938 --> 16:08.706
Well, exactly. Which just proves

16:08.773 --> 16:10.674
That you both know that it was wrong. Mom!

16:10.742 --> 16:12.576
I'm in college. This is what people do.

16:12.644 --> 16:13.810
Really? You think because these are

16:13.878 --> 16:15.212
Your, what, formative years,

16:15.280 --> 16:17.347
That you can just go ahead
and hurt people's feelings

16:17.415 --> 16:19.049
Just so long as you get something out of it?

16:19.117 --> 16:20.617
Well, I got news for you, ned.

16:20.685 --> 16:23.353
These are tj's and vivian's
formative years, too.

16:23.421 --> 16:24.354
It's not like I'm going around--

16:24.422 --> 16:25.656
Do you want to be that guy?

16:25.723 --> 16:27.858
That guy that teaches
girls that guys are jerks

16:27.926 --> 16:29.727
And can't be trusted?

16:31.096 --> 16:32.996
Noah.

16:33.064 --> 16:35.498
Hey.

16:35.566 --> 16:36.699
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:36.767 --> 16:39.535
You sure?

16:39.603 --> 16:42.672
Great, thanks.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.374
Noah found the transcript.

16:44.441 --> 16:46.576
He said it's practically
verbatim the one we used.

16:46.644 --> 16:48.511
Except the couple was married

16:48.579 --> 16:50.679
And the wife who got dumped,
her name's maggie carson.

16:50.747 --> 16:52.747
Could you please not change the subject?

16:52.815 --> 16:54.049
I'm not done with you yet.

16:54.116 --> 16:57.753
Neither is a really pissed off ghost.

16:57.820 --> 17:00.655
Hey, melinda. I got a name.

17:07.959 --> 17:10.294
Uh, maggie carson?

17:10.361 --> 17:12.694
Stevens.

17:12.762 --> 17:13.996
What can I do for you?

17:14.064 --> 17:15.195
My name is melinda gordon.

17:15.263 --> 17:16.494
And I'm actually here to talk to you

17:16.496 --> 17:17.963
About your visit at the radio station.

17:19.598 --> 17:22.233
I didn't give them my name,
so how'd you find me?

17:22.300 --> 17:25.102
It's a long story, but the short version is

17:25.169 --> 17:26.970
Is that we were going through old
transcripts at the radio station,

17:27.037 --> 17:28.471
And we took a lucky guess.

17:28.538 --> 17:31.537
I'm here to apologize on
behalf of the station.

17:31.604 --> 17:33.104
Well, you're about eight years too late.

17:33.172 --> 17:35.033
I'm sure it was a terrible time for you.

17:35.101 --> 17:37.401
Terrible? Doesn't really come close.

17:37.469 --> 17:41.471
Being dumped live on the air,
it's humiliating.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.706
I never thought that those pranks were real.

17:43.773 --> 17:45.407
I mean, I always assumed

17:45.474 --> 17:47.475
That one person was in on it
to win some kind of prize.

17:47.543 --> 17:50.377
I guess in your case the prize
was a trip to the bahamas?

17:50.445 --> 17:53.113
Yeah, well, my ex-husband's the
one who got a prize, all right.

17:53.181 --> 17:55.649
He ended up marrying the
woman he left me for.

17:55.716 --> 17:59.152
This is going to sound strange,
but is he still alive?

17:59.219 --> 18:01.320
Why are you asking me that?

18:01.388 --> 18:03.222
I'm just pretty sure that somebody died

18:03.289 --> 18:05.290
After what the dj did with your call.

18:05.357 --> 18:06.557
The only thing that died that day

18:06.625 --> 18:10.094
Was my marriage, and if--

18:10.162 --> 18:12.396
Damn it, not again.

18:12.463 --> 18:14.397
Oh, that's happened before?

18:14.465 --> 18:15.699
Oh, it's just this stupid radio.

18:15.766 --> 18:17.433
It's got a mind of its own.

18:17.501 --> 18:18.934
Well, does the song mean anything to you?

18:19.002 --> 18:20.102
No, I've never heard it before.

18:20.170 --> 18:21.570
Wait a minute, did your radio

18:21.638 --> 18:23.371
Just turn itself on the other night?

18:23.439 --> 18:26.241
And that's how you heard the
show in the first place?

18:26.308 --> 18:28.443
Ok, who are you?

18:32.313 --> 18:33.579
Hey, you all right?

18:37.751 --> 18:38.784
Hello?

18:39.919 --> 18:41.986
I'm sorry.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.756
Totally lost my train of thought.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.024
Um, anyway--

18:46.091 --> 18:47.825
Look, I don't know who you are,

18:47.893 --> 18:49.159
But you're really creeping me out.

18:49.227 --> 18:51.195
So please, I think you should leave.

18:55.833 --> 18:56.967
Hey.

18:57.035 --> 18:58.368
Do you want your old job back?

18:58.436 --> 19:00.069
No, my wireless is down,

19:00.137 --> 19:01.637
And I just wanted to search those names

19:01.705 --> 19:03.105
That you texted me. Oh!

19:03.173 --> 19:06.140
Look at this-- maggie
stevens' ex-husband's name

19:06.208 --> 19:07.608
Is jack carson.

19:07.676 --> 19:09.810
He remarried. His second, her first.

19:09.878 --> 19:12.512
Which means maggie was telling the truth,
the prank was real.

19:12.579 --> 19:14.246
You doubted her?

19:14.314 --> 19:15.548
Well, she just got really tense

19:15.615 --> 19:16.782
When I mentioned somebody had died.

19:16.850 --> 19:17.882
I think she knows more
than she's letting on.

19:17.950 --> 19:18.950
Who did jack marry?

19:19.018 --> 19:21.185
Uh, daisy manning.

19:21.253 --> 19:23.888
Daisy. That explains aiden's drawing.

19:23.956 --> 19:26.457
Yeah, but how could she
have been his undoing?

19:26.525 --> 19:29.727
There's absolutely no record
of jack carson's death.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.528
What about daisy? Is she still alive?

19:31.596 --> 19:34.031
Ok, I'm checking it now.

19:34.098 --> 19:37.133
I can't find any obituary.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.867
So our ghost isn't jack or daisy,

19:38.935 --> 19:41.069
But ned told me that dj
mentioned collateral damage.

19:41.137 --> 19:43.705
Was there anybody in daisy's
life before she married jack?

19:43.772 --> 19:44.705
Ok, let's find out.

19:44.773 --> 19:49.009
Then let's nail this ghost.

19:49.077 --> 19:50.711
Nobody hurts my kid.

19:50.779 --> 19:54.414
Even if he is a two-timing jerk.

19:55.550 --> 19:57.818
Bingo. You were right.

19:57.886 --> 19:59.587
So daisy was engaged before,

19:59.654 --> 20:02.589
To a man named bruce adler.
Look at the date.

20:02.657 --> 20:03.857
A month before the broadcast.

20:03.925 --> 20:05.191
Ok, hang on.

20:09.762 --> 20:13.264
And guess who's been a missing person
since the day of the radio show.

20:13.331 --> 20:16.533
Yep. We got our ghost.

20:23.371 --> 20:26.005
So I spoke to a supervisor

20:26.072 --> 20:29.173
And I got us upgraded to a royalty suite

20:29.240 --> 20:30.840
With a private balcony.

20:30.908 --> 20:32.007
Nice.

20:32.075 --> 20:34.909
Guess I better pack my tuxedo.

20:34.977 --> 20:37.344
Hey, did you leave the stereo on?

20:37.412 --> 20:40.545
Wasn't me.

20:41.880 --> 20:45.147
Uh, daisy, you're bring your wedding dress?

20:45.215 --> 20:47.382
What?

20:50.252 --> 20:51.785
Wait, that's not your--

20:51.853 --> 20:55.154
No, that's the one I bought
when I was engaged to bruce.

20:55.222 --> 20:58.089
It's been packed away in the garage.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.426
Then how the hell did it get here?

21:07.736 --> 21:09.536
Aahh!

21:16.226 --> 21:17.526
Hi. Excuse me,

21:17.593 --> 21:18.760
My name is melinda gordon.

21:18.828 --> 21:20.128
You must be jack.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.930
I'm sorry, do I know you?

21:21.998 --> 21:25.835
No, I was hoping to talk
to you or your wife.

21:25.903 --> 21:27.736
Does she know you?

21:28.772 --> 21:30.406
No.

21:30.473 --> 21:32.808
Wait, I'm sorry,
this isn't a very good time.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.742
I can see that.

21:36.711 --> 21:40.213
Um, I need to talk to you about bruce adler.

21:41.649 --> 21:43.983
Does that mean anything to you?

21:44.051 --> 21:45.451
Oh, my god.

21:50.522 --> 21:52.222
You're saying a ghost did all of this?

21:52.290 --> 21:53.890
I haven't seen bruce,

21:53.958 --> 21:55.124
And I don't have proof that he's dead,

21:55.192 --> 21:56.192
But that's my guess.

21:56.259 --> 21:57.526
He's dead.

21:57.594 --> 21:59.127
I've always known it.

21:59.195 --> 22:00.295
How?

22:00.363 --> 22:02.597
Because bruce wouldn't just disappear.

22:02.664 --> 22:05.599
He had a life, he had a job, he had parents.

22:05.667 --> 22:08.501
He wouldn't blow out of his
office one day and just vanish.

22:08.569 --> 22:09.635
We were engaged.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.737
So you two were happy together.

22:11.805 --> 22:13.038
Yeah!

22:14.340 --> 22:16.574
I'm sorry, I'm just a little confused.

22:16.642 --> 22:18.075
Because didn't you leave bruce

22:18.143 --> 22:19.877
So that the two of you could be together?

22:19.945 --> 22:22.046
What are you talking about?

22:22.113 --> 22:23.747
I read a transcript at the radio station.

22:23.814 --> 22:27.383
On air you told your wife that you
were leaving to be with daisy.

22:29.586 --> 22:31.253
How do you know about that?

22:31.320 --> 22:32.754
The ghost has been using the radio station

22:32.821 --> 22:35.222
To haunt people. He dug up your call

22:35.290 --> 22:37.891
And tricked the new djs
into playing it on air.

22:37.959 --> 22:40.193
Ok, jack, what call?
What is she talking about?

22:40.261 --> 22:42.695
Wait a minute, you didn't
know about the radio show?

22:42.763 --> 22:43.830
No.

22:43.897 --> 22:45.565
You told your wife what?

22:45.632 --> 22:46.599
Ok, I can explain.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.033
Thank you for trying to help us,

22:48.101 --> 22:49.835
But I really think that you should leave.

22:49.903 --> 22:51.203
The ghost is angry.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.804
He blames what happened that day, your call,

22:52.872 --> 22:54.205
For his death.

22:54.273 --> 22:57.041
There's one song that keeps
playing over and over again,

22:57.109 --> 22:59.509
And the dj who got you to do this,

22:59.576 --> 23:01.577
He's been tortured by it for years.

23:03.146 --> 23:04.512
What song?

23:04.580 --> 23:06.647
Coldplay, "in my place."

23:06.714 --> 23:09.316
That's the song that was
playing when the picture broke.

23:09.383 --> 23:12.284
Ok, so does it mean anything to you?
Is it your song with bruce?

23:12.352 --> 23:14.153
No.

23:14.221 --> 23:15.454
Ok, so you've never heard it before

23:15.522 --> 23:17.489
When strange things have
happened like today?

23:17.557 --> 23:20.291
Nothing like this has ever happened.

23:20.359 --> 23:22.494
Why would he punish us?

23:22.561 --> 23:23.695
We didn't do anything wrong.

23:23.762 --> 23:25.530
We fell in love.

23:25.597 --> 23:29.198
After you separated from your wife.

23:29.266 --> 23:32.334
Look, I freelanced at the
place that jack worked.

23:32.402 --> 23:34.603
I left one day because I got a phone call

23:34.671 --> 23:38.039
From the police saying
that my fiance was missing.

23:38.106 --> 23:39.940
I couldn't sleep.

23:40.008 --> 23:42.876
I couldn't function, for days, for weeks.

23:42.944 --> 23:45.145
I never even went back to that place.

23:45.212 --> 23:47.213
It was months before I ran into jack again.

23:47.281 --> 23:49.548
By then, I'd split up with my wife.

23:49.616 --> 23:52.918
Look, I don't know what my husband
told some stupid radio show.

23:52.985 --> 23:54.953
But if you can really talk to ghosts,

23:55.020 --> 23:58.022
You tell bruce. You tell
him we did nothing wrong.

23:58.090 --> 24:00.257
Nothing.

24:03.027 --> 24:04.026
So that's it?

24:04.094 --> 24:05.561
The husband didn't explain anything?

24:05.629 --> 24:06.962
He showed me my way to the door

24:07.030 --> 24:09.130
As if I'd never been kicked
out of a house before.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.965
Do you think that they were lying?

24:11.033 --> 24:12.566
I think she didn't know
about the radio stunt.

24:12.633 --> 24:15.335
How is that possible? I don't know.

24:15.402 --> 24:16.903
I mean, maybe they didn't
have any friends in common.

24:16.970 --> 24:18.838
You know, daisy never back to that office.

24:18.906 --> 24:20.206
They didn't have very many listeners.

24:20.273 --> 24:21.373
Yeah, but if they were a couple--

24:21.441 --> 24:22.641
Well, maybe they weren't.

24:22.708 --> 24:23.842
Maybe she was telling the truth.

24:23.910 --> 24:25.376
Listen, they would not be the first cheaters

24:25.444 --> 24:26.844
To claim that they only hooked up

24:26.912 --> 24:29.046
After both parties were free.

24:29.114 --> 24:30.247
Hmm. Is it possible

24:30.315 --> 24:31.782
That the ghost didn't know

24:31.849 --> 24:33.817
That they wound up together? Yeah, but how?

24:33.884 --> 24:35.418
I mean, even if they waited out of decency

24:35.485 --> 24:37.653
To tell their friends
once bruce went missing.

24:37.721 --> 24:38.821
You know, he's a ghost.

24:38.888 --> 24:40.822
I think he would have known.

24:40.890 --> 24:43.157
Then how come the ghost
is just haunting the dj?

24:43.225 --> 24:44.491
I'd have to ask him that,

24:44.559 --> 24:45.826
But he doesn't seem to
want to come to the party.

24:45.893 --> 24:47.560
Hmm. Some party.

24:47.628 --> 24:48.861
Listen, I'm parking.

25:06.543 --> 25:09.178
Help...Help!

25:29.597 --> 25:31.231
Melinda!

25:31.298 --> 25:33.066
What happened? Are you ok?

25:33.134 --> 25:36.502
I'm fine. I think I know how bruce died,

25:36.569 --> 25:37.736
And maybe where he is.

25:37.804 --> 25:38.770
You had a vision?

25:38.838 --> 25:40.738
I know I should be used to this, but...

25:40.806 --> 25:43.340
Daisy said that her fiance
just blew out of work suddenly,

25:43.407 --> 25:45.341
And he works at duncroft electronics.

25:45.409 --> 25:46.909
Where is that? It's off of amherst road.

25:46.977 --> 25:49.444
Ok, and he thought that his fiancÃ©e
was heading for the bahamas.

25:49.512 --> 25:51.779
So what street would he take to the airport?

25:51.847 --> 25:53.614
Probably the teason expressway.

25:53.682 --> 25:56.383
It's got some bad curves,
but it's the fastest way.

25:56.451 --> 25:58.752
Right. And it runs along the river.

25:58.820 --> 26:01.655
Hi, I need to speak to detective
blair. It's important.

26:03.924 --> 26:06.459
It was so weird.

26:06.526 --> 26:08.494
I mean, the car was completely submerged,

26:08.561 --> 26:10.195
But that song was still playing.

26:10.263 --> 26:12.998
And while he was dying.

26:13.065 --> 26:14.265
Well, I guess aiden was right.

26:14.333 --> 26:15.866
You know, daisy really was bruce's undoing.

26:15.934 --> 26:18.368
I'm still not sure aiden
gave me that vision.

26:18.436 --> 26:20.536
I mean, I think the ghost wanted me

26:20.604 --> 26:22.105
To know that he suffered, and not alone.

26:22.172 --> 26:24.340
Are you sure that there weren't
two people found in that car?

26:24.407 --> 26:25.674
Just this one.

26:25.742 --> 26:27.609
But I heard a woman screaming.

26:27.677 --> 26:29.177
I don't know what to tell you, honey.

26:29.245 --> 26:31.312
That car they found him in,

26:31.380 --> 26:32.814
The doors were locked,
the windows were open.

26:32.881 --> 26:34.815
It was registered to bruce adler.

26:34.883 --> 26:36.483
Until the cops get the dental records,

26:36.551 --> 26:38.552
They can't notify the family.

27:04.274 --> 27:06.742
Maybe they need dental records,

27:06.809 --> 27:08.977
But I don't.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.845
That's the ghost.

27:18.456 --> 27:19.889
Jack, hi.

27:19.957 --> 27:22.058
Hi, um, can I talk to you?

27:22.125 --> 27:24.726
Yeah, sure.

27:24.794 --> 27:26.828
After you'd left,

27:26.896 --> 27:27.895
Daisy was really upset.

27:27.963 --> 27:29.663
I'm sorry to hear that.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.998
But the haunting that you experienced,
it's only the beginning.

27:33.065 --> 27:36.499
the thing is, daisy was telling the truth.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.334
About how the two of you got involved.

27:38.402 --> 27:39.335
Yes.

27:39.403 --> 27:41.137
So then why would you go on air

27:41.205 --> 27:42.838
And tell your wife that you were leaving her

27:42.906 --> 27:44.173
For another woman?

27:44.240 --> 27:46.275
A woman you coincidentally married.

27:46.342 --> 27:48.075
Do you get my confusion?

27:48.143 --> 27:50.010
Your wife's, the ghost?

27:50.078 --> 27:52.146
Wait, you talked to my ex,

27:52.213 --> 27:53.947
Maggie? Yes.

27:54.015 --> 27:57.283
And you say bruce died because
he heard us on the radio?

27:57.351 --> 28:00.119
I think he was going to
the airport to stop you.

28:00.187 --> 28:02.754
Or to talk to his fiancÃ©e.

28:02.822 --> 28:05.156
It all seemed so harmless.

28:05.224 --> 28:06.957
Harmless?

28:08.493 --> 28:11.294
All right, jack, are you ready to do this?

28:11.361 --> 28:14.129
I'm going to get your wife on the line now.

28:14.196 --> 28:15.763
You said she's at work, right? Jack: Yeah.

28:15.831 --> 28:16.997
hello?

28:17.065 --> 28:18.665
Mags, it's me.

28:18.733 --> 28:19.766
Hey.

28:19.834 --> 28:21.768
You ok? No, I'm not.

28:21.836 --> 28:23.003
I have something to tell you.

28:23.070 --> 28:24.504
Are you alone? What do you...

28:24.572 --> 28:26.539
I told my wife that I was leaving her.

28:26.606 --> 28:29.841
Well, you know, you saw the transcript.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.976
What do you mean you're
not coming home tonight?

28:32.044 --> 28:33.777
Maggie, I--

28:33.845 --> 28:36.312
Things haven't been going well,
and I'm leaving.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.381
Things haven't been going well?

28:38.448 --> 28:39.682
What are you talking about?

28:39.750 --> 28:40.917
I want a divorce.

28:40.984 --> 28:42.318
It's over.

28:42.386 --> 28:43.386
I can't believe this.

28:43.453 --> 28:45.555
You're telling me this over the phone?

28:45.623 --> 28:47.056
I'm sorry, it's just--

28:47.124 --> 28:49.591
There's no other way to say it.

28:52.295 --> 28:54.529
So she was in on it?

28:54.596 --> 28:56.063
We were instant messaging back and forth

28:56.131 --> 28:57.565
The entire time.

28:57.633 --> 28:58.933
But she told me that it was a horrible shock

28:59.001 --> 29:00.335
And that it ended your marriage.

29:00.403 --> 29:02.004
In a way it did.

29:02.071 --> 29:03.906
Things were never the same after that call.

29:03.973 --> 29:05.673
Our trip sucked. It was like

29:05.741 --> 29:08.209
I opened the door for every
doubt she had about me.

29:08.277 --> 29:10.412
So wait a minute. Maggie lied to me?

29:10.479 --> 29:12.347
Why would she do that?

29:12.414 --> 29:14.748
All I know is that she
can be very convincing.

29:14.816 --> 29:16.317
Who is she? What?

29:16.384 --> 29:18.285
Maggie, there's no one.

29:18.353 --> 29:20.154
Tell her about the trip, jack.

29:20.221 --> 29:21.855
The one to the bahamas.

29:21.923 --> 29:23.857
Wait, you said that-- the one you're taking

29:23.925 --> 29:25.292
With your girlfriend. Tell her!

29:25.360 --> 29:26.593
What's happening? Who is this?

29:26.661 --> 29:29.863
Hey, maggie, this is dj dean olsen at wqry.

29:29.931 --> 29:31.865
I know this is upsetting,

29:31.932 --> 29:34.365
But this is your chance
to get all the details,

29:34.433 --> 29:38.333
Like who your husband's going to
be rolling around in the sand with.

29:38.401 --> 29:42.703
You're taking her on vacation
the day you leave me?

29:42.771 --> 29:43.904
Who is she?!

29:45.606 --> 29:48.006
Maggie, let's meet. We'll talk.

29:48.074 --> 29:50.108
Oh, now you want to meet!

29:50.176 --> 29:52.009
Why, so you can lie to me some more

29:52.077 --> 29:53.243
About all the late nights?

29:53.311 --> 29:54.777
Maggie, really, this is enough.

29:54.844 --> 29:56.544
Late night?

29:56.612 --> 29:58.612
Jack, didn't you tell me there
was one very late night?

29:58.679 --> 30:00.212
At some party?

30:00.280 --> 30:02.413
The party at doozy's house!

30:02.481 --> 30:04.749
When I was home, sick! Jack,

30:04.816 --> 30:07.118
Your wife needs to know. She has a right.

30:07.185 --> 30:09.186
And don't forget about our deal.

30:09.254 --> 30:11.221
Full disclosure, no holding back.

30:11.289 --> 30:12.922
So who is she? Come on.

30:12.990 --> 30:15.591
A hammock and clear blue waters

30:15.659 --> 30:17.259
Are waiting for you and the woman you love!

30:17.327 --> 30:19.527
The thing is, I didn't know
why she brought up that party.

30:19.595 --> 30:21.395
I thought she was just playing along.

30:21.463 --> 30:23.097
But I still had to name someone

30:23.164 --> 30:24.364
Or good-bye, bahamas.

30:24.432 --> 30:25.965
And the trip that you wanted to take

30:26.033 --> 30:27.766
With your wife maggie. To get it,

30:27.834 --> 30:29.234
I named a girl who worked in my office.

30:29.302 --> 30:30.869
I said I was leaving her for daisy.

30:30.936 --> 30:32.704
Why would you do that
if you weren't involved?

30:32.772 --> 30:35.376
She was the first person
that popped into my head.

30:35.443 --> 30:38.581
I know it's hard to believe
with us married and all,

30:38.650 --> 30:39.951
But it was random.

30:41.454 --> 30:44.790
He just kept pushing me
and pushing me for a name.

30:44.858 --> 30:47.493
And so did your wife.

30:50.330 --> 30:52.664
Even though she knew it was a prank.

30:52.732 --> 30:56.734
Even thought your instant
message told her to stop.

30:58.136 --> 31:00.070
Did you know daisy was engaged?

31:00.138 --> 31:01.404
Yeah.

31:01.472 --> 31:02.772
So did my wife. I--

31:02.840 --> 31:05.841
I guess that's why she
seemed like a safe choice.

31:05.908 --> 31:07.942
Did she know her?

31:10.011 --> 31:13.814
The whole floor would go
out for drinks sometimes.

31:13.882 --> 31:18.085
Daisy brought bruce,
maggie would usually join us.

31:18.152 --> 31:20.920
Was she jealous of her?

31:20.988 --> 31:24.290
I could not have a
conversation with a woman,

31:24.357 --> 31:27.425
Any woman, without maggie
grilling me with questions.

31:27.493 --> 31:30.328
But I was faithful, I swear.

31:30.395 --> 31:34.334
so she never got the
answer she was looking for.

31:34.402 --> 31:36.436
And she thought she could get somebody else

31:36.503 --> 31:38.137
To get it out of you.

31:40.273 --> 31:43.208
Like a radio dj.

31:45.277 --> 31:49.246
Somebody parked in front the
other day asking for directions,

31:49.314 --> 31:50.915
Radio blasting.

31:50.982 --> 31:54.485
I was cringing, nothing happening.

31:54.552 --> 31:56.118
I went to the store,

31:56.186 --> 31:58.087
Music floating throughout the sound system,

31:58.154 --> 32:00.355
Song after song.

32:00.423 --> 32:03.624
But not that song. The ghost song.

32:03.691 --> 32:06.359
Either he has changed his playlist,
or he's done with me.

32:06.427 --> 32:08.027
We think he's done with you.

32:08.095 --> 32:10.863
Unfortunately, he's moved
on to his ex-fiancÃ©e

32:10.931 --> 32:12.531
And her new husband jack.

32:12.599 --> 32:14.900
Wait a minute, he married that girl?

32:14.968 --> 32:16.868
Daisy. You remember the call now?

32:16.936 --> 32:19.036
I read the transcript you found.

32:19.104 --> 32:22.139
We think until the ghost realized
they're actually together,

32:22.207 --> 32:24.474
He was either dormant or
happy to haunt just you.

32:24.542 --> 32:26.075
After he died,

32:26.143 --> 32:28.177
He probably saw that the
callers were still together.

32:28.245 --> 32:29.578
Hmm.

32:29.645 --> 32:30.879
At least for a little while.

32:30.947 --> 32:33.414
And then he saw his fiancÃ©e
crying her eyes out,

32:33.482 --> 32:36.050
Missing him, and realized
he had died for nothing.

32:36.118 --> 32:37.485
Not for nothing.

32:37.552 --> 32:39.419
For my ratings.

32:41.088 --> 32:42.322
How can I help them?

32:42.389 --> 32:44.857
You said you've been over
the transcript, right?

32:44.925 --> 32:46.492
Yeah. It sounded like

32:46.560 --> 32:47.826
The bit where he's leaving her

32:47.894 --> 32:50.161
Was just you goading him into an admission--

32:50.229 --> 32:51.428
A real admission.

32:51.496 --> 32:52.563
Well, yeah. That's what his wife wanted.

32:55.267 --> 32:57.134
You're sure?

32:57.202 --> 32:58.235
You remember?

32:58.303 --> 32:59.469
Well, even if I didn't,

32:59.537 --> 33:00.904
These pieces have a rhythm.

33:00.971 --> 33:02.372
You know, you do 'em.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.640
Somebody's looking for a name.

33:04.708 --> 33:08.743
If this guy wasn't a friend of the
station or professional actor--

33:08.811 --> 33:09.878
He wasn't. Right.

33:09.945 --> 33:11.913
Then his wife put us on his tail.

33:11.981 --> 33:13.081
She called the station,

33:13.149 --> 33:14.816
She let us know about her suspicions.

33:14.884 --> 33:17.485
She basically turned us loose on him.

33:17.553 --> 33:20.054
That's how it works.
Sometimes we use people.

33:20.122 --> 33:21.889
And sometimes, they use you.

33:26.327 --> 33:28.660
Uh, sorry, we're, uh, we're closed.

33:28.728 --> 33:31.596
I'm not here for a hair appointment,
and I think you know that.

33:31.665 --> 33:33.466
Well, I got a thousand things to do.
I gotta get home.

33:33.533 --> 33:35.600
You lied to me, which is fine.

33:35.667 --> 33:37.400
'cause who am I really, except a stranger

33:37.468 --> 33:39.234
Who's trying to help you. Help me how?

33:39.302 --> 33:41.036
By digging up the most
painful moment of my life?

33:41.104 --> 33:42.671
And which moment was that?

33:42.738 --> 33:45.940
When your husband admitted that he
found some girl in the office cute?

33:46.007 --> 33:49.909
Or was it when you heard her fiancÃ©'s
car run off the road and into the river?

33:49.977 --> 33:51.110
You're out of your mind.

33:51.178 --> 33:52.211
I saw what happened.

33:52.279 --> 33:53.646
I heard your voice screaming.

33:53.713 --> 33:55.147
Did you realize what song was playing

33:55.215 --> 33:56.548
In the background when he died?

33:59.618 --> 34:01.953
How did you do that?

34:02.020 --> 34:04.221
I didn't. Bruce did.

34:04.289 --> 34:07.257
Maggie, you started this.
I'm just asking you to finish it.

34:07.325 --> 34:09.292
How? By talking to bruce.

34:09.360 --> 34:12.061
I don't know any bruce!

34:13.963 --> 34:16.197
Ok, well, you're lying about that, too,

34:16.264 --> 34:19.132
Because your ex-husband said that you
guys used to hang out after work.

34:19.201 --> 34:20.268
Well, I don't remember that.

34:20.335 --> 34:21.601
Ok, well, do you remember

34:21.670 --> 34:23.804
Being on the phone with him
right after the radio prank?

34:23.871 --> 34:25.806
I mean, it was you who told
him to turn on dean's show.

34:25.873 --> 34:28.040
I mean, really, did you think
that he was going to be able

34:28.108 --> 34:29.474
To stop something that
wasn't even happening?

34:29.542 --> 34:31.376
Shut up, shut up!

34:56.600 --> 34:58.534
Bruce, what are you doing?

35:03.838 --> 35:05.539
Oh, my god, oh, my god, get me out of here!

35:05.606 --> 35:08.241
Maggie, I'm trying, just hold on.

35:11.245 --> 35:13.012
Her jealousy killed me.

35:13.079 --> 35:16.081
Now she can drown in it.

35:17.283 --> 35:20.518
Please!

35:34.548 --> 35:35.715
Maggie, just hang in there!

35:35.782 --> 35:37.550
I turned off the water main.

35:52.964 --> 35:54.564
I got it!

35:57.767 --> 36:00.067
Anyone in there?

36:00.135 --> 36:02.803
We're in here!

36:18.551 --> 36:21.753
I don't know how I'm going
to explain the water damage

36:21.821 --> 36:23.421
To the owner of the salon.

36:23.489 --> 36:26.823
I know, I got bigger problems.

36:26.891 --> 36:29.058
So then why did you do it?

36:29.126 --> 36:31.160
'cause even though I knew it was crazy,

36:31.228 --> 36:33.328
I never trusted my husband.

36:33.396 --> 36:36.431
You know, I'd heard that show before.

36:36.499 --> 36:37.532
Dj dean.

36:37.599 --> 36:40.835
God, I thought the callers were so pathetic.

36:40.903 --> 36:45.305
And then I thought, you know,
this could work for me.

36:45.373 --> 36:48.808
If I could get a third party,
a stranger, really,

36:48.876 --> 36:50.410
Just to talk to my husband,

36:50.477 --> 36:52.645
Maybe he'd tell the truth.

36:52.712 --> 36:56.481
And I'd finally, finally believe him.

36:56.548 --> 36:59.483
Or ifinally be over.

36:59.550 --> 37:00.783
So you called bruce after the show.

37:00.851 --> 37:02.451
Yeah. Just like you said.

37:02.519 --> 37:04.786
I heard the accident.

37:04.854 --> 37:07.522
God, it was awful.

37:07.590 --> 37:11.392
And then I called an anonymous
tip into the police,

37:11.459 --> 37:12.859
But I couldn't even tell them where to look.

37:12.927 --> 37:16.029
I mean, I didn't even know what
kind of car he was driving.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.146
And his cell phone went dead.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.014
But I didn't know he died,

37:40.082 --> 37:42.316
I swear. I mean, not at first.

37:42.384 --> 37:45.084
And you saw that he was
missing in the papers.

37:45.152 --> 37:46.452
When we got back from our trip.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.988
Our horrible trip.

37:49.056 --> 37:51.490
But by then, I knew it was too late,

37:51.558 --> 37:53.760
For everything.

37:53.828 --> 37:56.596
Your husband said he was faithful.

37:56.664 --> 37:59.365
Why didn't you believe him?

38:00.634 --> 38:03.836
My mother divorced my father

38:03.904 --> 38:06.338
When I was three months old.

38:06.406 --> 38:09.174
She said she was afraid
he'd get her pregnant again,

38:09.241 --> 38:12.910
Like I was the worst thing
that had ever happened to her.

38:12.977 --> 38:15.845
That could ever happen to anyone.

38:15.913 --> 38:18.181
That's not how jack felt.

38:18.248 --> 38:19.715
He did eventually.

38:19.783 --> 38:22.384
And you know, I knew,
every time I questioned him

38:22.452 --> 38:26.354
About where he was, who he'd been with.

38:26.422 --> 38:28.922
She was begging him to love her.

38:28.990 --> 38:32.758
I was driving him away.

38:32.826 --> 38:34.460
But I couldn't stop.

38:37.129 --> 38:38.829
Bruce is here.

38:44.201 --> 38:47.536
I didn't even want daisy
to take that job.Ow.

38:47.604 --> 38:49.805
Any job, really, where...

38:49.872 --> 38:52.941
Where'd she be around other guys.

38:53.009 --> 38:56.144
That's crazy. I mean,
you can't ask that of any girlfriend.

38:56.212 --> 38:58.980
He's saying that he was jealous, too.

38:59.048 --> 39:02.216
you know, we were all out one night.

39:02.284 --> 39:03.617
Whoa!

39:03.685 --> 39:06.419
And jack and daisy, they were laughing.

39:06.487 --> 39:08.623
It was some inside office joke.

39:08.690 --> 39:12.459
Bruce and I could not have been
further from their thoughts.

39:12.527 --> 39:14.728
I caught maggie's eye,

39:14.796 --> 39:17.930
And gave her a look like, you believe this?

39:17.998 --> 39:20.099
To let her know, yeah, there's trouble,

39:20.167 --> 39:21.901
And I see it, too.

39:21.968 --> 39:23.969
I gave you the opening.

39:24.037 --> 39:28.506
But it only took one call from her saying,
"turn on the radio."

39:30.442 --> 39:32.075
I just thought,

39:32.143 --> 39:34.942
If nothing else, they were getting closer.

39:35.010 --> 39:37.010
And I just--I wanted bruce to help,

39:37.078 --> 39:39.312
Like, to help me stop it.

39:39.379 --> 39:40.779
I didn't need to listen.

39:40.847 --> 39:42.380
Climbed in the car to confront them.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.815
I could have called daisy myself, but...

39:44.883 --> 39:48.018
I'd always thought that
whatever we had wouldn't last.

39:48.086 --> 39:51.721
That it would end with her
leaving me for someone else.

39:51.789 --> 39:54.757
Someone better.

39:54.825 --> 39:56.792
He blames himself.

39:56.860 --> 39:59.961
For giving ihis fear and feeding yours.

40:00.029 --> 40:03.097
They're always there.

40:07.001 --> 40:08.468
The love you want,

40:08.536 --> 40:10.269
You can't get that from someone else--

40:10.337 --> 40:12.137
Husbands, girlfriend.

40:12.205 --> 40:15.240
Even if your parents gave it
to you now, it'd be too late.

40:16.509 --> 40:18.310
He's saying that the love you need to find

40:18.377 --> 40:19.944
Isn't romantic love;

40:20.012 --> 40:22.947
That you can't find it with somebody else.

40:23.014 --> 40:25.149
That sounds grim.

40:27.685 --> 40:29.819
Tell her it's all around her.

40:29.887 --> 40:31.621
It's in her heart right now,

40:31.688 --> 40:33.455
Waiting for her.

40:33.523 --> 40:35.957
I will.

40:36.025 --> 40:37.859
Maggie, you made their being together real

40:37.927 --> 40:41.095
By believing so hard.

40:41.163 --> 40:44.965
But believing can make
good stuff happen, too.

40:45.032 --> 40:46.166
If you just try.

40:46.234 --> 40:49.869
He said that if you can believe in happiness

40:49.937 --> 40:52.004
The same way that you believe in bad things,

40:52.072 --> 40:54.273
You'll find it.

40:54.340 --> 40:56.007
It's all around us.

40:57.276 --> 40:59.410
I see that now.

41:03.981 --> 41:06.316
It's beautiful.

41:06.383 --> 41:08.017
You see the light?

41:08.085 --> 41:10.553
Yeah.

41:10.620 --> 41:12.554
Do you?

41:12.622 --> 41:15.123
No.

41:16.558 --> 41:18.125
But you trust that it's there?

41:20.494 --> 41:21.861
It's a good feeling, right?

41:21.929 --> 41:24.864
It's a great feeling.

41:40.145 --> 41:42.546
He's gone.

41:55.991 --> 41:57.758
Hi, maggie. I want to apologize.

41:57.826 --> 42:00.094
We never meant you any disrespect...

42:02.330 --> 42:04.865
So, we've been having some pretty
weird technical difficulties here

42:04.932 --> 42:07.300
Wqry this past week.

42:07.368 --> 42:09.802
But I'm happy to report they
have all been taken care of

42:09.870 --> 42:13.605
And that we are back in the
business of rocking rock u.

42:13.673 --> 42:16.574
The funny thing about technical errors

42:16.642 --> 42:20.277
Is that you can usually figure out
exactly what caused the problem,

42:20.278 --> 42:23.280
And fix everything up as good as new.

42:23.348 --> 42:26.549
Is that you can usually I wish the
samwere true for human errors.Roblem,

42:26.617 --> 42:29.518
Wouldn't it be great if
when we really screw up,

42:29.586 --> 42:31.887
Weould figure out exactly what
made us act like a jackass

42:31.955 --> 42:33.555
In the first place?

42:33.623 --> 42:36.290
And repair the damage.

42:36.358 --> 42:38.792
Of course, w'd all be better off

42:38.860 --> 42:42.129
If we could avoid making stupid
choices inhe first place.

42:42.196 --> 42:44.864
Take a minute, think about
the collateral damage

42:44.932 --> 42:47.933
Thate're causing in sebody else's life.

42:48.001 --> 42:49.668
As it is,

42:49.735 --> 42:52.070
All we have is, "I'm rr"

42:52.137 --> 42:55.239
And belie me,

42:55.307 --> 42:58.174
I am.

42:59.343 --> 43:01.444
Sweet dreams, grandview.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.517
Hello?

43:09.584 --> 43:10.918
Hey.

43:10.986 --> 43:13.786
I just wanted to tell you that...

43:13.854 --> 43:16.922
I'm really proud of you.

43:16.990 --> 43:20.258
Really? Yeah.

43:20.326 --> 43:22.660
Really.

43:22.728 --> 43:25.395
Maybe we can get dinner one night this week.
