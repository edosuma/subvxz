WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.473
IT'S FRIDAY, WORKING STIFFS!

00:02.473 --> 00:03.574
EVERYBODY!

00:03.574 --> 00:06.377
(all) FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

00:06.377 --> 00:08.008
HAPPY WEEKEND!
(clink)

00:08.008 --> 00:10.581
WHOO!
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

00:10.581 --> 00:12.043
IT'S 3:45.

00:12.043 --> 00:14.685
HOW MANY HOURS DID YOU PEOPLE
EVEN WORK TODAY?

00:14.685 --> 00:18.419
I PUT IN A HARD FOUR.
ALL RIGHT, I DIDN'T GO IN.

00:18.419 --> 00:22.022
HEY, GUYS, HOW COME
WE NEVER TALK ABOUT WORK?

00:22.022 --> 00:25.296
TO GET AHEAD, GET A HOME.

00:25.296 --> 00:28.459
TO GET AHEAD, GET A HOME.

00:28.459 --> 00:31.232
YEAH, A BEER.
THAT'S A BEER.
TO GET AHEAD, GET A HOME.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.504
THERE YOU GO. THERE'S A BEER
RIGHT THERE.

00:33.504 --> 00:35.536
GREAT SHOT.
(speaks indistinctly)
BEER. YES, BEER.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.408
TO GET AHEAD...
FOCUS.

00:37.408 --> 00:39.470
THIS IS WRONG.
THIS IS WRONG.
WHO WANTED A BEER?
OH, YOU GUYS.

00:39.470 --> 00:42.543
NO, WAIT. I WAS WRONG.
THIS IS RIGHT.
TO GET AHEAD...

00:42.543 --> 00:44.345
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.077
YOUR JOBS ARE LAME.

00:46.077 --> 00:48.079
STRONG WORDS FROM SOMEONE
WHO SPENT THEIR 20s

00:48.079 --> 00:50.521
AS A TEQUILA-SHOT GIRL
IN A DIVE BAR.

00:50.521 --> 00:52.553
BIG SOMBRERO, PUSH-UP BRA,

00:52.553 --> 00:55.226
TWO SHOT GLASSES IN LITTLE
HOLSTERS. (imitates gunshots)

00:55.226 --> 00:57.628
THAT'S HOW SHE GOT DATES--
SHE'D GIVE FREE SHOTS

00:57.628 --> 01:00.761
TO ANY GUY WHO HAD A FAST CAR
AND A GOLD WATCH.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.763
MY WIFE WAS...
(high-pitched voice) в™Є EASY в™Є

01:02.763 --> 01:04.435
(normal voice) UH, GOLD.

01:04.435 --> 01:05.596
LAUGH!

01:05.596 --> 01:08.769
I SAW MYSELF LAUGH
IN THE MIRROR LAST NIGHT,

01:08.769 --> 01:11.302
AND I THOUGHT IT LOOKED
A LITTLE HORSEY,

01:11.302 --> 01:15.306
SO NOW I'M GONNA SAY IT
INSTEAD OF DO IT.
SEEMS NATURAL.
TELL ME MORE ABOUT SHOT SLUT.

01:15.306 --> 01:18.509
OH, YOU DON'T GET TO PLAY. I'VE
KNOWN THESE IDIOTS FOR YEARS.

01:18.509 --> 01:20.611
THEY KNOW MY DIRT,
BUT I ALSO KNOW THEIRS.

01:20.611 --> 01:22.683
DID YOU KNOW
THAT IN HIGH SCHOOL,

01:22.683 --> 01:24.685
THE BOYS CALLED JULES
"SLUG TONGUE"

01:24.685 --> 01:26.787
BECAUSE OF HOW SHE KISSED?

01:26.787 --> 01:28.189
BLAH!

01:28.189 --> 01:31.422
I DIDN'T HAVE A SISTER.
NO ONE TAUGHT ME.

01:31.422 --> 01:33.824
LAUGH!
STILL HORSEY.

01:33.824 --> 01:37.498
IT'S NOT FAIR. I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR PAST.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.300
AND YOU NEVER WILL. HMM.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.601
ADIOS.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.103
(types on keyboard)
"GRAYSON ELLIS."

01:43.103 --> 01:46.377
AND SEARCH.

01:46.377 --> 01:47.878
OH!

01:47.878 --> 01:50.481
IT'S SO NICE TO BE HERE
WITH YOU THIS WEEKEND

01:50.481 --> 01:53.884
AND NOT AT YOUR MOM'S
WITH THE PURPLE TOOTH CREW.
HMM?

01:53.884 --> 01:58.189
THEY JUST DRINK A LOT OF WINE.
YOU'RE AWESOME. MWAH.

01:58.189 --> 02:02.623
DON'T WORRY, KEV. YOU'LL FIND
YOUR CHOCOLATE KIRSTEN SOMEDAY.
(mouths words)

02:02.623 --> 02:05.156
THOSE ARE HIS WORDS,
NOT MINE.

02:05.156 --> 02:07.198
HE EVEN WROTE A SONG
ABOUT IT.

02:07.198 --> 02:10.701
в™Є OH, MY CHOCOLATE в™Є

02:10.701 --> 02:13.264
в™Є KIRSTEN в™Є

02:13.264 --> 02:14.835
в™Є OOH в™Є

02:14.835 --> 02:16.437
в™Є AH в™Є

02:16.437 --> 02:18.839
YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY
FIXED MY GAME?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.471
YOGA.

02:20.471 --> 02:22.743
I JUST DON'T GET ANGRY
ANYMORE.

02:24.915 --> 02:27.848
WHORE!
WHOA!
THROTTLE IT BACK, ROGER.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.381
YOU JUST NEED TO OPEN UP
YOUR HIPS.

02:30.381 --> 02:32.283
SEE THAT CLOWN

02:32.283 --> 02:34.725
WHO THINKS IT'S OKAY TO LITTER
ON THIS BEAUTIFUL COURSE?

02:36.857 --> 02:40.231
(thud)
WHOO! I MEANT TO DO THAT!

02:40.231 --> 02:42.893
'CAUSE THERE'S A TRASH CAN
RIGHT OVER...

02:45.196 --> 02:46.667
(thud)

02:46.667 --> 02:48.168
THERE!

02:48.168 --> 02:49.640
THAT WAS AMAZING!

02:49.640 --> 02:53.244
HEY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S THIS
P.G.A. TOURNAMENT NEXT MONTH,

02:53.244 --> 02:56.347
AND ONE OF THE QUALIFYING EVENTS
IS UP IN SARASOTA.

02:56.347 --> 02:59.410
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A SHOT?
MM.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.852
YOUSHOULDGIVE IT A SHOT.

03:01.852 --> 03:05.856
YOU'RE THE BEST GOLFER
I HAVE EVER KNOWN.
BOBBY BATMAN COBB,
WE BELIEVE IN YOU.

03:05.856 --> 03:08.719
WHAT?
OH, ONE OF OUR SPECIAL THINGS
IS TO PRETEND

03:08.719 --> 03:11.692
THAT HIS MIDDLE NAME IS "BATMAN"
AND MINE IS "ROBIN,"

03:11.692 --> 03:14.695
AND TOGETHER WE GO OUT--
OKAY, DON'T CARE.
LOOK, BOBBY, ANDY IS RIGHT.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.868
OH, REALLY? ARE YOU
BOTH SULKING? OKAY, FINE.

03:17.868 --> 03:20.731
LOOK, BATMAN, ROBIN'S RIGHT.

03:20.731 --> 03:23.304
YAY!
OKAY, CUTE.

03:23.304 --> 03:26.737
I CAN'T DO BIG TOURNAMENTS
ANYMORE. IT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

03:26.737 --> 03:29.340
OKAY, FINE.
HERE'S YOUR MAIL.

03:29.340 --> 03:32.743
YOU STILL CAN'T GET MAIL HERE?
NOPE. I EVEN MADE
MY OWN MAILBOX, TOO.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.987
MAILMAN SAYS IT'S STILL NOT
A LEGAL RESIDENCE, THOUGH.

03:36.987 --> 03:39.390
I HATE LAWS.

03:39.390 --> 03:41.221
HEY! SCREW YOU, GARY!

03:41.221 --> 03:43.494
KEEP IT MOVING, GARY!

03:43.494 --> 03:45.656
OH, NICE SHORTS, PAL!

03:45.656 --> 03:49.330
WE ARE SO GLAD YOU GUYS
ARE HERE FOR A CHANGE.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.761
YEAH, ANDY SEEMS THRILLED.

03:50.761 --> 03:53.364
IT'S 9:15. I SHOULD'VE BEEN
ASLEEP AN HOUR AGO.

03:53.364 --> 03:56.507
GRAYSON, I DID
A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH.

03:56.507 --> 03:58.309
JULES, DID YOU KNOW
THAT AS A KID,

03:58.309 --> 04:01.241
HE SPENT TIME
ON THE PAGEANT CIRCUIT?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.714
I DID NOT.
AND I'M UP.

04:03.714 --> 04:05.716
OH, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

04:05.716 --> 04:08.018
WE DO.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

04:08.018 --> 04:10.421
1980's LITTLE MISS MIAMI.

04:10.421 --> 04:11.922
(shoes click)

04:11.922 --> 04:14.425
в™Єв™Єв™Є

04:14.425 --> 04:16.026
(clicks button)

04:16.026 --> 04:18.529
IT WAS LITTLEMR.MIAMI, OKAY?

04:18.529 --> 04:20.731
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL.

04:20.731 --> 04:23.394
I-I-I BROKE DOWN
THE GENDER BARRIER.

04:23.394 --> 04:24.665
WHICH GENDER?

04:24.665 --> 04:27.638
WELCOME TO YOUR PAST,
BEEYOTCH!

04:29.570 --> 04:32.343
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A SORORITY
PARTY WITH A DATE BEFORE.

04:32.343 --> 04:35.346
IT'S KINDA COOL HOW ALL THESE
GIRLS ARE SUDDENLY INTO ME.

04:35.346 --> 04:37.548
JUST COOL FOR ME, HUH?

04:37.548 --> 04:40.511
YEAH. IS THAT LAURIE?

04:40.511 --> 04:42.513
I OVERHEARD KYLE--
THAT DOUCHE-Y SIGMA CHI

04:42.513 --> 04:44.515
WHO'S ALWAYS WEARING
THE JESTER HAT--

04:44.515 --> 04:46.517
SAY THAT HE HOOKED UP
WITH MISSY HERE,

04:46.517 --> 04:48.519
EVEN THOUGH HE DATES A KAPPA.

04:48.519 --> 04:50.861
MISSY, DID YOU?
(mouths word)

04:50.861 --> 04:54.365
WOW. SHE TOTALLY DID.

04:54.365 --> 04:55.426
(women) LAUGH!

04:55.426 --> 04:56.827
BUT, SISTERS,

04:56.827 --> 04:58.799
THIS IS A REAL TEACHING MOMENT.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.372
THE ONLY WAY
TO NOT BE LABELED A TRAMP

05:01.372 --> 05:04.435
IS TO NOT SLEEP WITH GUYS
WHO TALK SO MUCH.

05:04.435 --> 05:05.736
LAUGH!

05:05.736 --> 05:07.908
NO, DEBRA, I'M DEAD SERIOUS.

05:07.908 --> 05:08.909
LAURIE?

05:08.909 --> 05:11.382
TRAV! HEY!

05:11.382 --> 05:12.483
ZETA!

05:12.483 --> 05:15.916
(women) ZETA!
(mouths words)

05:15.916 --> 05:19.920
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE IF BOBBY
ENTERS A STUPID GOLF TOURNAMENT?

05:19.920 --> 05:22.653
DO YOU EVER WONDER WHY I MARRIED
BOBBY IN THE FIRST PLACE?

05:22.653 --> 05:24.655
NO.
EVERY DAY.

05:24.655 --> 05:26.056
WHEN I MET HIM, HE WAS
AN ALL-AMERICAN GOLFER,

05:26.056 --> 05:28.659
THE MOST CONFIDENT MAN
I'D EVER MET IN MY LIFE.

05:28.659 --> 05:32.733
AND NOW HE'S LOST THAT
CONFIDENCE. I-I-I MISS THAT GUY.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.866
BOBBY WAS REALLY A STUD?

05:35.866 --> 05:37.868
OKAY, CLOSE YOUR EYES.
COME ON. DO IT.

05:37.868 --> 05:42.072
IMAGINE BOBBY WITH
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HAIR.

05:42.072 --> 05:43.674
OOH! (chuckles)
(door opens)

05:43.674 --> 05:45.546
REALLY?
SHH.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.078
(door closes)
HE WAS RIPPED
LIKE A GREEK GOD.

05:48.078 --> 05:49.680
MY MICROWAVE'S BROKEN.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.853
I ATE A WHOLE TUB
OF UNCOOKED BISCUIT DOUGH,

05:52.853 --> 05:54.855
AND I THINK IT'S RISING
IN MY STOMACH.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.657
(groans)

05:58.659 --> 06:00.431
EYES BACK CLOSED.

06:00.431 --> 06:05.396
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:11.742 --> 06:14.144
THIS IS A GOLF TOURNAMENT.
WHERE ARE ALL THE FANS?

06:14.144 --> 06:17.948
THIS PLACE SHOULD BE ROARING
WITH POLITE GOLF CLAPS.
NO ONE SHOWS UP FOR QUALIFIERS.

06:17.948 --> 06:19.980
ROBERT COBB TO THE TEE.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.083
QUICK CONFIDENCE DANCE?
SURE THING, BATMAN.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.556
KABOOM!

06:25.556 --> 06:26.687
POW!

06:26.687 --> 06:29.460
BOING!
OOH, HOW YOU DOING, SIR?

06:29.460 --> 06:32.823
KABOOM!

06:34.164 --> 06:36.627
LAST WEEK, YOU SAID
YOU WOULDN'T PLAY IN THIS.

06:36.627 --> 06:38.128
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

06:38.128 --> 06:41.432
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT HOW
TO GET BOBBY'S CONFIDENCE BACK.

06:41.432 --> 06:44.575
THAT'S WHY I GATHERED
THE DRINK TANK THINK TANK.

06:44.575 --> 06:48.809
I WANT RED.
NO, NO, NO.
WHITE WINE HAS LESS ALCOHOL.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.681
OOH, THINKING WINE.

06:50.681 --> 06:52.813
WHAT IS KEEPING BOBBY DOWN?

06:52.813 --> 06:54.414
MAYBE HE'S DOWN

06:54.414 --> 06:56.717
BECAUSE HIS RETIREMENT PLAN IS
TO DIE "EARLY."

06:56.717 --> 06:59.720
PLUS, ON HIS BOAT, HE HAS TO
KEEP HIS CHOLESTEROL MEDICINE

06:59.720 --> 07:02.493
IN A LOCKBOX
SO THE RATS CAN'T GET IT.

07:02.493 --> 07:04.855
MY TURN AGAIN--
HIS GARBAGE DISPOSAL IS A DOG.

07:04.855 --> 07:07.097
HE EATS CEREAL
OUT OF A TURTLE SHELL.

07:07.097 --> 07:10.831
HIS BOTTLE OPENER IS A DOG.
OKAY, STOP.
HE'S NOT FRED FLINTSTONE.

07:10.831 --> 07:14.765
HE REALLY HATES THAT HE CAN'T
GET HIS MAIL ON THE BOAT.
THAT'S IT.

07:14.765 --> 07:17.608
TO GET AHEAD, GET A HOME.

07:17.608 --> 07:19.510
WORST SLOGAN EVER.

07:19.510 --> 07:22.442
IT'S NOT. BOBBY DOESN'T
HAVE A REAL HOME,

07:22.442 --> 07:24.815
SO LET'S TURN HIS BOAT
INTO ONE.

07:24.815 --> 07:26.817
WE CAN ADD SOME HOMEY TOUCHES
LIKE CURTAINS

07:26.817 --> 07:29.119
AND, YOU KNOW, A TOILET.

07:29.119 --> 07:31.622
WE COULD TAKE IT
OUT OF THE PARKING LOT

07:31.622 --> 07:35.085
AND INTO A SLIP IN THE MARINA,
AND HE GETS A NEW LIFE.
SHE'S RIGHT.

07:35.085 --> 07:37.688
WATCH THIS. I'LL BE BOBBY.
(imitating Bobby) HEY, BABY.

07:37.688 --> 07:40.731
WANNA COME BACK TO MY BOAT
IN AN ABANDONED PARKING LOT?
(makes slapping sound)

07:40.731 --> 07:43.694
(normal voice) EXACTLY.
BUT WATCH THIS...

07:43.694 --> 07:47.137
(imitating Bobby) WANNA COME
BACK TO MY BOAT IN THEMARINA?
YEAH.

07:47.137 --> 07:49.469
BOOM! LIFE CHANGE.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.543
COULDN'T WE JUST GET HIM
A SPARKLY SLEEVELESS VEST

07:52.543 --> 07:55.245
SO HE COULD TAP DANCE
ALL HIS PROBLEMS AWAY?

07:55.245 --> 07:57.748
(laughs)

07:57.748 --> 08:00.551
(imitates tap shoes clicking)
"DO YOU LOVE ME NOW, MOMMY?"

08:00.551 --> 08:02.583
"I'M GOING FASTER.
I'M GOING HARDER.

08:02.583 --> 08:06.617
I'M TRYING SO HARD!
I'M TRYING SO HARD!"

08:06.617 --> 08:07.758
SEARCH.

08:07.758 --> 08:09.590
(clicks key)

08:12.963 --> 08:15.566
WHY PRETEND TO BE
IN A SORORITY?

08:15.566 --> 08:17.728
WELL, BACK WHEN I WAS 20,
I USED TO FAKE IT ALL THE TIME

08:17.728 --> 08:19.600
BECAUSE THE PARTIES ROCK,

08:19.600 --> 08:22.603
AND SOMETIMES I JUST WANNA WEAR
PEARLS WITHOUT BEING JUDGED.
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.875
THIS TIME,
I WAS JUST GONNA SNEAK IN

08:24.875 --> 08:27.207
AND STEAL A BOX
OF HAIR SCRUNCHIES,

08:27.207 --> 08:29.279
BUT THOSE GIRLS LOVE ME,

08:29.279 --> 08:31.642
AND MY SELF-ESTEEM COULD USE
A PICK-ME-UP,

08:31.642 --> 08:34.845
SO I TOLD THEM I WAS
A TRANSFER FROM FLORIDA STATE.

08:34.845 --> 08:36.847
IT'S LIKE SOME KIND OF DRUG
FOR ME.

08:36.847 --> 08:39.850
THEY TAKE MY ADVICE. THEY LET ME
PICK OUT THEIR CLOTHES.

08:39.850 --> 08:42.122
UGH! KAREN IS
SUCH A COLD, UGLY BITCH.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.024
SHE'S A TOTAL ELLIE.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.297
THEY LET ME MAKE UP NEW WORDS
FOR THINGS.

08:47.297 --> 08:48.899
PLUS, I GIVE BACK.

08:48.899 --> 08:50.901
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,

08:50.901 --> 08:52.903
SARAH MYERS WAS TALKING ABOUT
COMMITTING SUICIDE,

08:52.903 --> 08:54.905
SO I CALLED HER PARENTS,

08:54.905 --> 08:57.237
AND THEY BOUGHT HER
A NEW CONVERTIBLE.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.009
PROBLEM SOLVED. PROUD LAUGH.

08:59.009 --> 09:01.071
IS THAT ONE
OF YOUR SELF-ESTEEM THINGS,

09:01.071 --> 09:03.073
BEING SELF-CONSCIOUS
ABOUT THE WAY YOU LAUGH?

09:03.073 --> 09:06.546
I LOVE THE WAY YOU LAUGH.
IT'S LIKE A HAPPY TUGBOAT.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.018
(imitates Laurie's laugh)
WHATEVER!

09:08.018 --> 09:10.581
YOU LAUGH LIKE
A CARTOON WOODPECKER.

09:10.581 --> 09:13.854
(imitates Travis' laugh)

09:13.854 --> 09:16.326
(sighs) YOU SAID
YOU'D BE HERE AN HOUR AGO.

09:16.326 --> 09:18.989
WE HAD TO GO BUY OUR FAKE
RATTY BOAT-FIXING OUTFITS.

09:18.989 --> 09:22.192
WE'RE SLOPPY, BUT ADORABLE.
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:22.192 --> 09:26.837
LOOK, GUYS, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF TIME. LET'S GET TO WORK.
WHAT IF BOBBY COMES BACK?

09:26.837 --> 09:28.799
HE WON'T.
TRAVIS HAS A GREAT PLAN.

09:28.799 --> 09:30.801
ARE YOU GUYS
REALLY DARING ME

09:30.801 --> 09:33.704
TO EAT THIS WHOLE TUB
OF CHEESY POPCORN?

09:33.704 --> 09:37.077
WE ARE, DAD. WE ALL ARE.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.679
BIG MISTAKE, MY FRIENDS.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.910
HUGE.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.712
(lid pops)

09:41.712 --> 09:44.755
ALL RIGHT, GANG, LET'S TURN
THIS DIRTY OLD BOAT INTO A HOME.

09:44.755 --> 09:47.357
(Katrina & the Waves) в™Є OW! в™Є

09:47.357 --> 09:49.990
в™Єв™Єв™Є

09:49.990 --> 09:54.064
в™Є MM, YEAH в™Є

09:54.064 --> 09:57.327
в™Є I USED TO THINK
MAYBE YOU LOVED ME в™Є

09:57.327 --> 10:00.270
в™Є NOW, BABY, I'M SURE в™Є

10:01.972 --> 10:05.275
в™Є AND I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO в™Є
(music stops)

10:05.275 --> 10:08.608
STOP TRYING TO MAKE THIS
INTO AN '80s MOVIE MONTAGE.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.812
JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT FUN.
WH-WHAT?

10:11.812 --> 10:16.316
FUN?
IF YOU WANT A MONTAGE, IT'S
GONNA BE A SWEATY, ANGRY ONE.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.949
в™Є I'M WALKING ON SUNSHINE в™Є

10:18.949 --> 10:20.851
в™Є WHOA в™Є

10:20.851 --> 10:22.893
в™ЄI'M WALKING ON SUNSHINE в™Є

10:22.893 --> 10:25.155
в™Є WHOA в™Є

10:25.155 --> 10:27.227
в™Є I'M WALKING ON SUNSHINE в™Є

10:27.227 --> 10:30.100
в™Є WHOA в™Є

10:30.100 --> 10:32.632
в™Є AND DON'T IT FEEL GOOD?
HEY! в™Є

10:32.632 --> 10:34.805
в™Є ALL RIGHT NOW в™Є

10:34.805 --> 10:36.807
(laughs)

10:36.807 --> 10:38.638
(laughs)

10:38.638 --> 10:40.811
в™Є AND DON'T IT FEEL GOOD? в™Є

10:40.811 --> 10:43.013
RIGHT. GOOD. OH, THAT'S NICE.

10:43.013 --> 10:45.345
в™Є AND DON'T IT FEEL GOOD? в™Є

10:45.345 --> 10:47.417
WISH WE HADN'T HAD DONE THAT.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.149
I'LL GET SOME RAGS.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.683
BYE, GRAYSON. PAGEANT WAVE.

10:52.683 --> 10:54.685
I WAS WAITING FOR THAT.

10:54.685 --> 10:57.888
I SPENT HOURS RESEARCHING YOU...
(chuckles)

10:57.888 --> 11:01.792
AND I WAS ABLE TO TRACK DOWN
A FEW NEW THINGS FROM YOUR PAST.
(folder thuds)

11:01.792 --> 11:05.796
SHA-DOOSH.
IF IT HAPPENED, IT'S IN HERE.

11:05.796 --> 11:08.168
HOW DO I KNOW THAT...
THIS IS REAL?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.900
GIRLFRIEND WANTS A TASTE.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.202
WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I RANDOMLY PULL

11:12.202 --> 11:15.806
SOMETHING FROM THE MIDDLE!
OH, LOOK, A TEENAGE ELLIE,

11:15.806 --> 11:17.848
LOOKING OFF TO THE SIDE
REALLY COOL,

11:17.848 --> 11:20.050
WITH... (high-pitched voice)
HUGE EYEBROWS.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.052
(laughs)

11:22.052 --> 11:24.154
I WIN.

11:24.154 --> 11:25.856
WHERE'S MY DOLLAR?

11:25.856 --> 11:29.189
DEFINITION
OF A HOLLOW VICTORY.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.421
MAN, I LOVE CHEESY POPCORN.

11:31.421 --> 11:34.424
HEY, BOBBY, YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
YOU'RE IN THE TOP SIX--

11:34.424 --> 11:37.467
WHOA, ANDY, NEVER TELL ME
HOW I'M DOING, MAN.

11:37.467 --> 11:39.469
THAT UNRAVELS MY GAME.

11:39.469 --> 11:41.832
CAN I SAY... "NICE SHOT"?

11:41.832 --> 11:43.273
YOU CAN SAY "SHOT."

11:52.082 --> 11:53.914
SHOT!

11:53.914 --> 11:56.216
TRAV,
IF YOU AND GIRLFRIEND WANT,

11:56.216 --> 11:58.218
ZETA'S HAVING
A COCKTAIL PARTY TONIGHT

11:58.218 --> 12:00.891
TO RAISE MONEY
FOR MEGAN'S RHINOPLASTY.

12:00.891 --> 12:04.354
WE MIGHT PASS, PARTLY BECAUSE
I LIKE MEGAN'S NOSE,

12:04.354 --> 12:07.257
BUT ALSO BECAUSE I THINK
SORORITIES ARE...

12:07.257 --> 12:08.829
ELITIST.

12:08.829 --> 12:12.002
DO YOU KNOW HOW OFFENSIVE
THAT IS TO A SORORITY GIRL?

12:12.002 --> 12:14.965
I DO, BUT FORTUNATELY,
YOU'RE NOT A SORORITY GIRL.

12:14.965 --> 12:17.808
BABE, IT'S JUST A COCKTAIL
PARTY. WE SHOULD GO.

12:17.808 --> 12:20.070
AH!
WHY DON'T YOU GO, TRAVIS?

12:20.070 --> 12:22.072
(imitates Laurie)
HAVE SUCH A BLAST

12:22.072 --> 12:25.345
WITH ALL OF YOUR NEW B.F.F.s!
LAUGH!

12:25.345 --> 12:27.347
SHE WOULD MAKE
SUCH A GREAT ZETA.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.350
I THINK SHE'S JUST MAD BECAUSE
SHE THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA HAVE

12:30.350 --> 12:33.824
A WEEKEND WHERE WE DIDN'T
HANG OUT WITH ALL YOU GUYS.
(grunts) THAT'S NOT IT.

12:33.824 --> 12:37.858
WHOA, HEAD RUSH. YOU GUYS
DISAPPEARED FOR A SECOND.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.160
SO WHAT'S SHE MAD ABOUT?

12:40.160 --> 12:43.093
OH, COME ON, GUYS, YOU KNOW.
(whistles) SHE'S JEALOUS.

12:43.093 --> 12:44.764
CATCH YOU LATER.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.436
WHAT?!

12:46.436 --> 12:49.769
THAT'S...
(laughs) THAT IS SO WEIRD!

12:49.769 --> 12:52.843
(tires screech, engine stops)

12:52.843 --> 12:54.875
(all) SURPRISE!

12:54.875 --> 12:57.147
NO WAY! GET OUT!
GET BACK IN!

12:57.147 --> 12:59.249
SHE LOOKS AMAZING!
JEALOUS MUCH?

12:59.249 --> 13:02.252
MWAH! FINALLY A "YES"!

13:02.252 --> 13:04.184
AH, DAMN CHEESE DUST.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.786
YOU SHOULD SEE THE INSIDE.
THERE'S A TOILET.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.960
I PUT A DOOR ON YOUR MICROWAVE.
TO PROTECT YOUR JUNK.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.092
TO GET AHEAD, GET A HOME.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.895
(laughs) WORST SLOGAN EVER,
BABY.

13:14.895 --> 13:15.996
YEAH, IT'S HORRIBLE.
IT BLOWS.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.998
(Grayson) IT'S REALLY BAD.
IT'S SO NOT!

13:17.998 --> 13:20.901
NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO IS GET
THIS BOAT OVER TO THE MARINA

13:20.901 --> 13:23.834
AND PUT IT INTO ITS NEW SLIP.
SO WAS JULES
BEHIND ALL THIS?

13:23.834 --> 13:25.805
WELL...
YES!

13:25.805 --> 13:26.877
(laughs)

13:26.877 --> 13:28.909
I SHOULD'VE LET YOU GUYS
ANSWER THAT.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.081
WOW. THANKS, JULES.
THANKS, EVERYBODY.

13:31.081 --> 13:32.442
SERIOUSLY, THIS, UH,

13:32.442 --> 13:36.847
THIS MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.

13:36.847 --> 13:39.589
BUDDY, YOU ARE KICKING ASS!

13:39.589 --> 13:43.253
ANDY, I TOLD YOU NOT TO TELL ME
HOW I'M DOING.
OH, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

13:45.195 --> 13:46.356
(thud)

13:46.356 --> 13:48.859
THAT! THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

13:48.859 --> 13:51.962
I'M GONNA KEEP SAYING "THAT"
UNTIL YOU REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS.

13:51.962 --> 13:53.463
THAT!

13:53.463 --> 13:56.066
THAT!

13:56.066 --> 13:57.837
THAT?

14:03.513 --> 14:05.115
THAT.

14:05.115 --> 14:07.517
WHAT HAPPENED? ARE WE--
WE STILL ON THE 12th HOLE?

14:07.517 --> 14:09.479
NO, THE 18th.
YOU'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND,

14:09.479 --> 14:12.482
MUMBLING FOR THE LAST SIX HOLES.
PULL IT TOGETHER, BUD.

14:12.482 --> 14:15.125
I'M DYING OUT HERE.
STUPID JULES.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.526
YOU'RE AWESOME, JULES.

14:16.526 --> 14:19.289
NOW WHEN CAN WE PUT HER IN
THE DRINK AND GET HER BUTT WET?

14:19.289 --> 14:21.431
OH, WHEN ARE WE GONNA PUT
THE BOAT IN THE WATER?

14:21.431 --> 14:24.294
(chuckles) WELL, I WANT
EVERYONE TO BE HERE.

14:24.294 --> 14:26.997
OH, J-BIRD, HOW AM I
EVER GONNA REPAY YOU?

14:26.997 --> 14:28.238
IT'S EASY.

14:28.238 --> 14:30.270
ENTER THAT TOURNAMENT.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.873
I WANT YOU TO BE THAT CONFIDENT
19-YEAR-OLD STUD AGAIN

14:33.873 --> 14:36.346
SO EVERYONE CAN SEE HIM.

14:36.346 --> 14:38.408
YOU KNOW, THAT GUY ALWAYS
USED TO WALK UP TO ME,

14:38.408 --> 14:42.312
AND HE WOULD SAY,
"I AM ONE LUCKY DUCK."

14:42.312 --> 14:44.654
REMEMBER?

14:44.654 --> 14:47.057
PLEASE. FOR ME?

14:47.057 --> 14:49.259
FOR YOU,

14:49.259 --> 14:50.890
YEAH.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.292
MY DAD IS CRAZY!

14:52.292 --> 14:55.996
LIKE ANYONE WOULD THINK OF US
AS MORE THAN FRIENDS.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.268
LOOK, I MEAN, SURE,

14:58.268 --> 15:01.501
YOU KNOW, I'M A LITTLE FLIRTY
WITH YOU,

15:01.501 --> 15:04.204
BUT COME ON.
I FLIRT WITH EVERYONE.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.476
I KNOW.
(laughs)

15:06.476 --> 15:11.041
WHAT?
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW YOUR MOM
WOULD REACT IF WE DATED?

15:11.041 --> 15:14.384
IT WOULD BE LIKE DROPPING A BOMB
ON A FOREST FIRE.

15:14.384 --> 15:17.187
THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT PUT OUT
THE FIRE BECAUSE THE BOMB

15:17.187 --> 15:21.291
USES UP THE OXYGEN,
AND FIRE NEEDS OXYGEN.
WEE-OOH! WEE-OOH! NERD ALERT.

15:21.291 --> 15:24.024
SORRY.
THAT'S CUTE COMING FROM YOU.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.026
AND THIS IS CRAZY.
YOU'RE OLDER, AND...

15:26.026 --> 15:29.229
I MEAN, KIRSTEN'S OLDER,
BUT YOU'RE, LIKE,OLDEROLDER.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.232
TAKE IT EASY.
YOU LIGHT TO FIGHT.
MY CUTS DON'T CLOT.

15:32.232 --> 15:36.136
THIS'LL JUST NEVER HAPPEN.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.008
(footsteps approach)
DON'T YOU THINK?

15:38.008 --> 15:39.569
TRAVIS, I AM SORRY.

15:39.569 --> 15:42.372
I JUST--OH. YOU'RE HERE.

15:42.372 --> 15:44.144
I SHOULD GO.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.676
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
TRAVIS AND I WERE JUST TALKING,

15:46.676 --> 15:49.179
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T GO TO COLLEGE HERE,

15:49.179 --> 15:52.182
AND IF YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE
I'M CROWDING YOU TWO, THEN FINE.

15:52.182 --> 15:54.184
I'LL JUST DO WHAT YOU SAY

15:54.184 --> 15:57.057
AND FLIP OUTTA HERE
LIKE A FLAPJACK. (scoffs)

15:57.057 --> 15:59.089
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

15:59.089 --> 16:02.692
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT,
BUT THANK YOU.

16:02.692 --> 16:04.434
NO PROBLEM.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.300
HEY, CATERPILLAR BROWS.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.543
CAN YOU GIVE ME
A RIDE TO THE MARINA?

16:13.543 --> 16:16.546
NOT JUST YET. I,TOO,
DID A LITTLE MORE DIGGING.

16:16.546 --> 16:18.648
WHAT WAS YOUR WORD?

16:18.648 --> 16:20.450
SHADOUCHE-Y.

16:20.450 --> 16:22.682
BRING IT.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.684
OH, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

16:24.684 --> 16:26.516
A HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.

16:26.516 --> 16:28.458
HOBBIES--ACNE.

16:28.458 --> 16:31.391
(book thuds)
OH, WHAT'S THIS?

16:31.391 --> 16:33.663
"HOT FLORIDA BARTENDERS
CALENDAR."

16:33.663 --> 16:36.726
OH, CAN WE COUNT
THE BANANA HAMMOCKS? ONE, TWO.

16:36.726 --> 16:40.530
OKAY, I WILL SEE THAT,
AND I WILL RAISE YOU

16:40.530 --> 16:42.532
A "REAL WORLD" AUDITION TAPE.

16:42.532 --> 16:45.775
"WHAT UP, MTV? I'M ELLIE.
PEACE!"

16:45.775 --> 16:48.778
(tape rattles)
AND... (laughs)

16:48.778 --> 16:51.581
A 10-YEAR-OLD POWER FORWARD
WHOSE MASSIVE HEADGEAR

16:51.581 --> 16:55.045
DROVE ALL HER TEAMMATES...
(high-pitched voice) CRAZY!

16:55.045 --> 16:56.046
(laughs)

16:56.046 --> 16:57.317
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:57.317 --> 17:00.720
WE SHOULD STOP
BEFORE ONE OF US GETS...

17:00.720 --> 17:04.194
(Grayson crying)
A TEARFUL VOICE MAIL TO THE GIRL
THAT TOOK YOUR VIRGINITY.

17:04.194 --> 17:07.627
Why don't you love me?
I love, you, Shelley!

17:07.627 --> 17:09.599
Pick up!
(tape stops)

17:09.599 --> 17:11.801
SO WHAT NOW?
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

17:11.801 --> 17:13.803
THIS IS WHAT FRIENDSHIP
MEANS TO ME--

17:13.803 --> 17:16.806
HAVING SO MUCH CRAP ON SOMEONE
THAT THEY CAN'T EVER REVEAL

17:16.806 --> 17:20.640
THE CRAP THEY HAVE ON YOU.
I FEEL CLOSER TO YOU THAN EVER.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.813
YOU'RE A SCARY WOMAN.
I TRY.

17:23.813 --> 17:27.647
I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE'RE
FEELING IN OUR HEARTS RIGHT NOW.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.650
COME ON, GUYS.
SAY IT TOGETHER.
SMELLS LIKE FISH OUT HERE.

17:30.650 --> 17:34.454
(speaks indistinctly)
REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW.
COME ON.
THE WORST SLOGAN EVER?

17:34.454 --> 17:37.457
(all) TO GET AHEAD, GET A HOME.

17:37.457 --> 17:41.261
WOW, THAT DOES SUCK. HMM.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A PUN.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.364
BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I DON'T EVEN GET WHAT PUNS ARE.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.337
OKAY, WHAT WAS I SAYING?
NO ONE CAN TELL, SWEETIE.

17:47.337 --> 17:48.798
THE BOAT.

17:48.798 --> 17:51.471
BOBBY COBB,
WHEN THAT BOAT HITS THE WATER,

17:51.471 --> 17:54.344
THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN
HOLD YOU BACK ANYMORE,

17:54.344 --> 17:56.476
BECAUSE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE,

17:56.476 --> 18:00.079
EVEN PLACING IN THE TOP SIX
IN OUR LOCAL GOLF TOURNAMENT.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.412
RUBEN! TO A NEW LIFE!

18:02.412 --> 18:03.683
(whirs)

18:03.683 --> 18:06.286
(cheering)

18:06.286 --> 18:08.718
(OneRepublic's "Good Life"
playing)

18:08.718 --> 18:10.360
(water gurgling)
(Andy) YAY!

18:10.360 --> 18:13.493
AH! OH...
(wood creaking)

18:13.493 --> 18:15.295
(Andy) IT'S, UH...
(all) OHH!

18:15.295 --> 18:17.597
(Grayson) OH, WAIT.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.270
(Jules and Laurie) OHH!
THAT'S--THAT'S...

18:20.270 --> 18:21.801
RUBEN?

18:21.801 --> 18:23.373
RUBE?

18:23.373 --> 18:24.874
в™Єв™Єв™Є

18:24.874 --> 18:26.606
OH, BOY.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.579
(gurgling)

18:29.579 --> 18:31.611
в™Є WOKE UP IN LONDON YESTERDAY в™Є

18:31.611 --> 18:34.744
UGH!
I HATE MOMENTS OF TRUTH.

18:34.744 --> 18:37.647
I LIKE THE OTHER MOMENTS--
HAPPY MOMENTS.

18:37.647 --> 18:39.649
YOU KNOW, CHRISTMAS ONES.

18:39.649 --> 18:43.353
HOW FAR ARE WE AWAY
FROM CHRISTMAS?
FOCUS. SINK THIS,
AND YOU'LL QUALIFY.

18:43.353 --> 18:46.556
YOU MISS IT, YOU'RE OUT.
YOU GOT THIS.

18:46.556 --> 18:48.158
REMEMBER,
YOU'RE BOBBY COBB.

18:48.158 --> 18:50.500
THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.402
I GOT HIS COFFEEPOT!

18:52.402 --> 18:55.405
I GOT A MUDDY DOLL WITH NO EYES.
IS THAT HIS?

18:55.405 --> 18:57.407
UH, PUT IT
IN THE "MAYBE" PILE.

18:57.407 --> 18:59.409
в™Є A GOOD LIFE, GOOD LIFE в™Є

18:59.409 --> 19:02.772
в™Є I SAY, OH, GOT THIS FEELING
THAT YOU CAN'T FIGHT в™Є

19:02.772 --> 19:05.645
I FEEL LIKE I OWE YOU
A "SORRY."

19:05.645 --> 19:08.248
YOU SANK MY HOME.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.919

19:09.919 --> 19:12.752
в™Є OH в™Є

19:14.384 --> 19:16.256
MNH-MNH.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.658
(both laughing)

19:18.658 --> 19:21.531
YES, BOBBY,
I SANK YOUR HOME.

19:21.531 --> 19:23.633
YOU SURE DID.

19:23.633 --> 19:26.766
в™Є THEY DON'T KNOW
WHERE I'VE BEEN в™Є

19:26.766 --> 19:30.240
SEE, THIS IS WHY I KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.772
A FEW YEARS AGO,
YOU WOULD NOT BE LAUGHING.

19:32.772 --> 19:36.376
THIS WOULD CRUSH YOU,
AND YOU WOULD SPIRAL FOR MONTHS.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.877
(laughs) I STILL MIGHT.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.511
NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
THAT GUY ANYMORE.

19:41.511 --> 19:43.513
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOURSELF.

19:43.513 --> 19:45.915
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD JOB.
YOU'RE A GREAT DAD.

19:45.915 --> 19:48.918
I MEAN, THE OLD BOBBY USED
TO HANG OUT WITH GUYS

19:48.918 --> 19:50.920
NAMED "BITCHSLAP."
(chuckles)

19:50.920 --> 19:53.693
NOW LOOK AT YOUR FRIENDS.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.266
AND THEY LOVE YOU.
I MEAN, ELLIE'S NOT TRYING

19:56.266 --> 19:59.399
TO GRAB ANY OF YOUR STUFF,
BUT SHE'S SUPERVISING.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.802
JELLY BEAN,
I SEE SOMETHING OVER THERE.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.504
USE YOUR HOOK.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.935
(whispers) WOW.

20:05.935 --> 20:07.707
(laughs)

20:07.707 --> 20:10.280

ALL OF THAT CONFIDENCE.

20:12.842 --> 20:14.784

20:14.784 --> 20:17.917
YOU JUST HAVEN'T LET IT

20:17.917 --> 20:20.490
в™Є OH, OH, в™Є

20:20.490 --> 20:21.821
в™Є OH в™Є

20:23.753 --> 20:27.257

LIKE A FOOL в™Є

20:27.257 --> 20:29.499
в™Є LET IT TAKE YOU OVER в™Є

20:29.499 --> 20:31.931
в™Є WHEN EVERYTHING IS OUT в™Є

20:31.931 --> 20:33.503
в™Є YOU GOTTA TAKE IT IN в™Є

20:33.503 --> 20:35.505
OHH!
YES!

20:35.505 --> 20:38.508
(all cheering and laughing)

20:38.508 --> 20:40.270
в™Є THIS HAS GOTTA
BE THE GOOD LIFE в™Є

20:40.270 --> 20:43.273
в™Є THIS COULD REALLY BE
A GOOD LIFE в™Є

20:43.273 --> 20:45.645
OHH.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
(Grayson shouts indistinctly)

20:57.256 --> 20:59.789
WHOO! AW.
(laughs)

21:05.995 --> 21:08.398
THANK YOU FOR FIXING THINGS
WITH KIRSTEN.

21:08.398 --> 21:11.270
OH, TRAV, I DIED FOR YOU.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.843
THE PHRASE IS ACTUALLY
"I'DDIEFOR YOU."

21:13.843 --> 21:16.446
NO, NO.
I LITERALLY DIED FOR YOU.

21:16.446 --> 21:19.709
THE ZETAS THINK I DROWNED
SCUBA DIVING OFF KEY LARGO.

21:19.709 --> 21:21.851
THAT'S ACTUALLY
MY CANDLELIGHT VIGIL.

21:21.851 --> 21:23.883
(women crying)

21:23.883 --> 21:25.785
ARE YOU TEARING UP?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.817
(voice breaking) IT'S SAD.

21:27.817 --> 21:30.660
I WAS A REALLY GREAT GIRL.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.563
(normal voice) I CAN'T
BELIEVE MISSY'S NOT CRYING.

21:33.563 --> 21:35.695

21:35.695 --> 21:37.397
