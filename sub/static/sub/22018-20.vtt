From now on, I don't need to be
a nervous wreck all the time.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.460
How'd it go here?

17:38.460 --> 17:40.120
Also great.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.960
Kathryn:
Katie, I found two houses

17:41.960 --> 17:43.790
right next to each other
on the beach,

17:43.790 --> 17:45.080
so we can be together.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.920
[ Clears throat ]

17:47.920 --> 17:48.960
You didn't tell her.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.960
So you got tenure!

17:50.960 --> 17:52.460
What's your endgame here?

17:52.460 --> 17:54.670
Eventually, she's gonna realize
we're still poor people

17:54.670 --> 17:56.580
who are buying the manager's
special discounted meat.

17:56.580 --> 17:58.250
That is
perfectly good meat.

17:58.250 --> 17:59.500
Expiration dates
are a scam.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.290
Katie, you need to
tell your mom the truth.

18:01.290 --> 18:02.580
So, what are you two
talking about?

18:02.580 --> 18:04.120
Katie has something
she needs to tell you.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.670
Okay, Greg,
you can leave.

18:05.670 --> 18:08.330
This is a sensitive
mother-daughter conversation,

18:08.330 --> 18:09.750
and she needs to
hear it from me.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.000
I understand.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.040
Kathryn,
we didn't get the money.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.420
Greg, I was gonna do it!

18:13.420 --> 18:14.960
-No, you weren't.
-I know.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.170
You lied to me?

18:18.170 --> 18:19.920
If I told you
we didn't get the money,

18:19.920 --> 18:21.380
you would just leave,

18:21.380 --> 18:24.250
and I'm happy that
you're hanging out with me.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.120
You never did that
when I was growing up.

18:26.120 --> 18:30.620
And I hate to admit this...
but I like you.

18:30.620 --> 18:32.000
Oh, honey,
I like you, too.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.790
I...

18:33.790 --> 18:35.040
Just sit down.

18:39.080 --> 18:42.750
Look, I know that I wasn't the
best mom to you kids growing up.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.000
What?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.080
Well, I was hoping
maybe you'd jump in

18:47.080 --> 18:49.210
and correct me,
but fine.

18:49.210 --> 18:52.500
Look, I was convinced
that no one was gonna

18:52.500 --> 18:55.580
take care of me
when I got older, so I...

18:55.580 --> 18:57.460
I latched on to Spencer.

18:57.460 --> 19:00.540
He was my safety net.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.920
And truth is, I was actually
very fond of him.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.830
Was it love?

19:04.830 --> 19:06.710
No.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.250
[ Sighs ]
But we did have fun together.

19:09.250 --> 19:13.380
And now I...
I don't have him anymore.

19:13.380 --> 19:17.290
Mom, I know it's not
a house on the water,

19:17.290 --> 19:21.080
but you always have a place
here with us.

19:21.080 --> 19:24.330
Thank you.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.460
We would've never
had this moment

19:27.460 --> 19:29.210
if he would've
given us the money.

19:29.210 --> 19:33.380
So I guess this is
our inheritance.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.620
Yeah, but the money
would've been nicer.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.080
-I miss it so much.
-Mm.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.960
I finally know what to do
with Spencer's ashes.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.290
He was my friend,
but he felt more like family.

19:46.290 --> 19:50.540
And like Spencer said,
"Family takes care of family."

19:50.540 --> 19:53.500
So I've decided that
he should stay with us.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.080
I think that's the way
he would've wanted it.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.420
[ Birds chirping ]

20:00.420 --> 20:01.830
Look!

20:01.830 --> 20:03.580
He's happy.

We're not gonna be terrorized
by a very tan ghost.

[ Chuckles ]

20:08.580 --> 20:10.380
Good job.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.000
You did
the right thing.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.040
What's this?

20:15.040 --> 20:17.580
It's your bill.
You owe me $75,000.

20:19.960 --> 20:23.500
Never should've had you toss me
that apple for five grand.

20:28.540 --> 20:31.460
Oliver, Spencer recorded
some additional videos for you

20:31.460 --> 20:33.880
to give you advice for
milestones in your life,

20:33.880 --> 20:35.580
to let you know
he's always there.

20:35.580 --> 20:38.080
This one is for
when you get into Harvard.

20:38.080 --> 20:41.330
This one is for when you make
your first million.

20:41.330 --> 20:43.460
This one is for
when you get married.

20:43.460 --> 20:46.120
This one is for when
you get married again.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.210
This one is
how to hide your money

20:48.210 --> 20:49.580
when the Feds
are on to you.

20:49.580 --> 20:53.620
And this one is just a VHS copy
of "9 1/2 Weeks."

20:53.620 --> 20:54.920
We'll hang on
to that one.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.460
Well,
that's everything.

It was very nice
meeting all of you.

Linda,
you have been great.

20:59.670 --> 21:02.380
Do you have a card in case
we ever need to hire a lawyer?

21:02.380 --> 21:03.960
Sure.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.120
It's a $50,000 retainer,

21:06.120 --> 21:08.080
then $200 per hour
plus expenses.

21:09.540 --> 21:11.380
