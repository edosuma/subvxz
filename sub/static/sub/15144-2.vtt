to enforce the rules.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.959
No, you do not.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.959
You are a hall monitor.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.291
You need to hold yourself

14:12.000 --> 14:14.291
to a higher standard.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.291
This is a clear abuse

14:14.333 --> 14:16.291
of your duty.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.000
[both]

14:16.333 --> 14:18.000
Ha ha, you said "duty."

14:18.041 --> 14:19.792
It is not funny this time.

14:19.834 --> 14:23.709
You're both fired.

14:19.834 --> 14:23.709
Turn in your sashes.

14:28.083 --> 14:31.375
Aw, I guess

14:28.083 --> 14:31.375
we should have SWERGed.

14:31.417 --> 14:33.000
Oh, well.

14:31.417 --> 14:33.000
You live, you learn.

14:35.709 --> 14:36.792
Welcome to FuzzFeed.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.083
So, Mr. Foot...

14:39.125 --> 14:41.250
[altered voice]

14:39.125 --> 14:41.250
Please, call me Pig.

14:41.291 --> 14:46.333
May I touch your hoof?

14:46.375 --> 14:48.542
So what's the first thing

14:46.375 --> 14:48.542
you're going to do

14:48.583 --> 14:50.083
when you come back to Edgewood?

14:50.125 --> 14:51.792
Well, you know,

14:50.125 --> 14:51.792
I want to boogie down

14:51.834 --> 14:54.208
and get my revenge

14:51.834 --> 14:54.208
on the principal.

14:54.250 --> 14:57.792
But if there's one thing I love

14:54.250 --> 14:57.792
more than disco and revenge,

14:57.834 --> 15:00.792
it's the bargains

14:57.834 --> 15:00.792
at Nicky's Get Piggy!

15:02.375 --> 15:05.834
Our video is crushing it.

15:02.375 --> 15:05.834
FuzzFeed is blowing up.

15:05.875 --> 15:09.834
What did I tell you?

15:05.875 --> 15:09.834
The pig is big, baby! Big!

15:09.875 --> 15:12.000
Look!

15:09.875 --> 15:12.000
There's our favorite reporter!

15:12.041 --> 15:13.792
[all cheering]

15:13.834 --> 15:17.166
Is Pigfoot really coming back

15:13.834 --> 15:17.166
to get revenge on the principal?

15:17.208 --> 15:18.458
Does he eat bacon?

15:18.500 --> 15:21.208
When he orders a BLT

15:18.500 --> 15:21.208
does he ask for a Me-L-T?

15:21.250 --> 15:23.875
Don't worry. All your questions

15:21.250 --> 15:23.875
will be answered.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.583
Just keep checking FuzzFeed.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.166
Wait!

15:25.625 --> 15:28.166
But how did you find him?

15:28.208 --> 15:32.500
A real reporter never reveals

15:28.208 --> 15:32.500
her secrets.

15:32.542 --> 15:34.959
You got a bright future, kid.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.500
A real reporter?

15:41.542 --> 15:43.917
So a real reporter dresses

15:41.542 --> 15:43.917
her brother up like a pig

15:43.959 --> 15:45.792
and makes up a bunch of lies?

15:45.834 --> 15:49.208
Well, you know what feels

15:45.834 --> 15:49.208
better than the truth?

15:49.250 --> 15:51.250
Nice job, Dawn.

15:51.291 --> 15:52.792
That.

15:52.834 --> 15:54.875
I don't even know that guy.

15:54.917 --> 15:58.875
And I don't even

15:54.917 --> 15:58.875
know you anymore.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.500
It's all your fault.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.208
We only got kicked off the force

16:00.542 --> 16:03.208
because we did things your way.

16:03.250 --> 16:06.458
Well, at least

16:03.250 --> 16:06.458
we got to hang out together.

16:08.333 --> 16:12.792
We're hanging from the lockers

16:08.333 --> 16:12.792
by our underwear.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.834
Together.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.625
So what do you make

16:14.875 --> 16:16.625
of this Pigfoot business?

16:16.667 --> 16:17.625
Pigfoot's not real.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.834
Of course Pigfoot's not real!

16:19.875 --> 16:21.083
But just in case he is,

16:21.125 --> 16:24.917
I do not want that thing

16:21.125 --> 16:24.917
in my hallways.

16:24.959 --> 16:28.291
You're re-hired.

16:24.959 --> 16:28.291
Find him, get rid of him.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.792
Or your sashes are mine.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.458
[both]

16:29.834 --> 16:31.458
Yes, sir!

16:36.166 --> 16:38.000
We're back.

16:38.041 --> 16:42.000
Oh, yeah. How are we

16:38.041 --> 16:42.000
going to get down?

16:42.041 --> 16:43.959
I don't know.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.417
[upbeat music]

16:47.458 --> 16:49.625
Come on,

16:47.458 --> 16:49.625
what's next for Pigfoot?

16:49.667 --> 16:52.500
You've always had good ideas.

16:49.667 --> 16:52.500
You can do this by yourself.

16:52.542 --> 16:53.959
You don't need Mae.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.291
<i>So you're really going</i>

16:54.000 --> 16:57.291
<i>to keep this going?</i>

16:57.333 --> 16:59.000
<i>- Of course</i>

16:57.333 --> 16:59.000
<i>she's going to keep it going.</i>

16:59.041 --> 17:00.625
<i>The pig is big, baby! Big!</i>

17:00.667 --> 17:02.875
<i>And it's time to make it bigger.</i>

17:02.917 --> 17:05.917
<i>No. It's time for Dawn</i>

17:02.917 --> 17:05.917
<i>to finally tell the truth.</i>

17:05.959 --> 17:08.333
<i>Don't listen to her.</i>

17:05.959 --> 17:08.333
<i>Give the people what they want.</i>

17:08.375 --> 17:09.667
<i>Don't listen to him.</i>

17:09.709 --> 17:10.750
<i>He just wants you</i>

17:09.709 --> 17:10.750
<i>to keep lying,</i>

17:10.792 --> 17:12.166
<i>so he can sell more stuff.</i>

17:12.208 --> 17:13.166
<i>- Pigfoot!</i>

17:12.208 --> 17:13.166
<i>- Truth!</i>

17:13.208 --> 17:14.166
<i>- Pigfoot!</i>

17:13.208 --> 17:14.166
<i>- Truth!</i>

17:14.208 --> 17:15.166
<i>- Pigfoot!</i>

17:14.208 --> 17:15.166
<i>- Truth!</i>

17:15.208 --> 17:19.291
<i>- Pigfoot!</i>

17:15.208 --> 17:19.291
[muffled shouting]

17:19.333 --> 17:22.208
I know what I need to do.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.750
- Don't worry, Squish.

17:23.792 --> 17:27.250
As soon as Daddy's done putting

17:23.792 --> 17:27.250
this cereal away, we can--

17:40.417 --> 17:44.375
Well, I think

17:40.417 --> 17:44.375
Daddy's done with chores.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.208
So you want to go for a walk?

17:44.417 --> 17:46.208
What do you say?

17:46.250 --> 17:47.458
[growls]

17:47.500 --> 17:49.417
Why are you growling?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.417
I'm wearing the cone.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.208
I thought we were buddies again.

17:51.250 --> 17:55.792
You know what, fine.

17:51.250 --> 17:55.792
I'm taking this thing off.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.834
Okay, Tom,

17:55.834 --> 17:57.834
I went to six different stores,

17:57.875 --> 18:00.375
but I finally found

17:57.875 --> 18:00.375
your bubble bath.

18:00.417 --> 18:01.375
Wow.

18:01.417 --> 18:03.792
- He--

18:01.417 --> 18:03.792
- I don't care.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.500
They were out

18:03.834 --> 18:05.500
of the no tears formula,

18:05.542 --> 18:06.792
so just be really careful

18:06.834 --> 18:08.333
about getting your bubble beard

18:06.834 --> 18:08.333
in your eyes.

18:08.375 --> 18:11.041
Oh.

18:08.375 --> 18:11.041
Thanks, Anne.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.542
I figured it was best

18:11.083 --> 18:12.542
to stay home

18:12.583 --> 18:16.333
ever since I got that ticket

18:12.583 --> 18:16.333
for driving with a cone on.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.208
[barking]

18:18.250 --> 18:20.375
Oh.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.375
Wait a minute.

18:20.417 --> 18:24.375
I ran out of bubble bath

18:20.417 --> 18:24.375
at the same time we started

18:20.417 --> 18:24.375
having problems.

18:24.417 --> 18:25.917
[barks]

18:25.959 --> 18:27.291
That's it!

18:27.333 --> 18:29.583
It wasn't the cone at all,

18:27.333 --> 18:29.583
was it, boy?

18:29.625 --> 18:32.417
[barks]

18:32.458 --> 18:34.333
You missed our bubble baths,

18:32.458 --> 18:34.333
didn't you, buddy?

18:34.375 --> 18:35.417
[barks]

18:35.458 --> 18:37.792
Woof! Woof!

18:37.834 --> 18:40.417
[upbeat music]

18:40.458 --> 18:41.583
Nicky, I need your help.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.041
- What's up?

18:41.625 --> 18:43.041
- Hang these up.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.750
I'm going to go give everybody

18:43.083 --> 18:44.750
what they want.

18:44.792 --> 18:47.083
Pigfoot. In the flesh.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.375
Happy to help.

18:49.417 --> 18:53.333
This is a trick I know, sis.

18:53.375 --> 18:55.166
So, if Pigfoot shows up,

18:53.375 --> 18:55.166
you ready?

18:55.208 --> 18:58.709
He's not real, so yeah.

18:55.208 --> 18:58.709
I'm all set.

18:58.750 --> 19:01.333
Psst!

19:01.375 --> 19:04.417
It's me, the principal.

19:04.458 --> 19:08.792
Look, I'm sure this Pigfoot

19:04.458 --> 19:08.792
stuff is all a hoax.

19:08.834 --> 19:10.208
But Dawn did print it

19:08.834 --> 19:10.208
in FuzzFeed,

19:10.250 --> 19:12.375
and we all know

19:10.250 --> 19:12.375
she always writes the truth.

19:12.417 --> 19:15.792
So I'm relying on you two

19:12.417 --> 19:15.792
and this mustache to protect me.

19:15.834 --> 19:17.458
Hey, Principal Tarian.

19:17.500 --> 19:21.417
It's down to you two.

19:21.458 --> 19:22.834
Hello, hello.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.792
Thank you all for coming

19:22.875 --> 19:25.792
and for reading my articles.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.166
We want Pigfoot.

19:27.208 --> 19:30.542
[all yelling]

19:30.583 --> 19:33.417
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

19:30.583 --> 19:33.417
Classmates.

19:33.458 --> 19:35.750
Who better to answer

19:33.458 --> 19:35.750
all your Pigfoot questions

19:35.792 --> 19:37.625
than Pigfoot himself?

19:37.667 --> 19:40.417
[all]

19:37.667 --> 19:40.417
Pigfoot! Pigfoot! Pigfoot!

19:40.458 --> 19:43.417
Pigfoot! Pigfoot! Pigfoot!

19:43.458 --> 19:45.750
[cheering]

19:48.458 --> 19:49.417
Can you pig it?

19:49.458 --> 19:51.875
[all]

19:49.458 --> 19:51.875
Yeah!

19:51.917 --> 19:53.792
Nicky, what are you doing here?

19:53.834 --> 19:55.375
You said you needed my help.

19:55.417 --> 19:56.542
We're giving the school Pigfoot.

19:56.583 --> 19:59.041
I just wanted you

19:56.583 --> 19:59.041
to hang up the posters.

19:59.083 --> 20:03.625
Oh.

19:59.083 --> 20:03.625
Well, you live, you learn.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.583
[snorts and grunts]

20:06.625 --> 20:07.792
We got him!

20:07.834 --> 20:09.500
He's real!

20:07.834 --> 20:09.500
He's totally real!

20:09.542 --> 20:12.750
I can't believe he's real!

20:12.792 --> 20:14.709
I knew he wasn't real.

20:14.750 --> 20:15.750
So he's a fake?

20:15.792 --> 20:19.542
So these are

20:15.792 --> 20:19.542
just regular carrots?

20:19.583 --> 20:21.709
Yeah.

20:19.583 --> 20:21.709
Dawn made the whole thing up.

20:21.750 --> 20:25.792
[all]

20:21.750 --> 20:25.792
Boo!

20:25.834 --> 20:27.500
Sorry, Dawn.

20:27.542 --> 20:30.875
No, Mae, you're right.

20:30.917 --> 20:33.166
The Pigfoot that you all

20:30.917 --> 20:33.166
believed in,

20:33.208 --> 20:36.583
the Pigfoot that I helped you

20:33.208 --> 20:36.583
believe in, is a lie.

20:36.625 --> 20:38.875
FuzzFeed promised you

20:36.625 --> 20:38.875
real news.

20:38.917 --> 20:42.208
The truth.

20:38.917 --> 20:42.208
Important stuff.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.166
But I broke that promise.

20:44.208 --> 20:47.750
So, to make up for it,

20:44.208 --> 20:47.750
I spent all night doing research

20:47.792 --> 20:50.041
and found the real Pigfoot.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.500
[all murmuring]

20:53.542 --> 20:56.542
Hello, everybody.

20:53.542 --> 20:56.542
My name is Harry Kawalsky.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.667
And as you can see,

20:56.583 --> 20:59.667
I have two normal feet.

20:59.709 --> 21:00.709
And I'm not a pig.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.792
[all]

21:00.750 --> 21:03.792
Boo!

21:03.834 --> 21:07.250
- It may not be what you want

21:03.834 --> 21:07.250
to hear, but it's the truth.

21:07.291 --> 21:09.083
Harry's family moved away

21:07.291 --> 21:09.083
from their pig farm

21:09.125 --> 21:10.625
the day of the avalanche,

21:10.667 --> 21:12.333
so everyone just assumed

21:10.667 --> 21:12.333
he got caught in it

21:12.375 --> 21:14.333
and fused together with his pig.

21:14.375 --> 21:17.667
It's an honest mistake.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.792
So there really is

21:17.709 --> 21:19.792
no Pigfoot.

21:19.834 --> 21:21.542
[all]

21:19.834 --> 21:21.542
Aw.

21:21.583 --> 21:24.542
But the dancing part is true.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.375
Now, who wants to learn

21:24.583 --> 21:27.375
to disco dance?

21:27.417 --> 21:29.709
[all]

21:27.417 --> 21:29.709
Yeah!

21:29.750 --> 21:31.709
[disco music]
