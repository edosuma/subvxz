00:26.110 --> 00:28.444
I was burnt out.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.405
I started taking stims.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.615
What are these?
Stims.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.201

taking them by the handful.

Let me go!
Hey, hey!

00:38.455 --> 00:40.707
You know, coming in late for a
briefing 'cause you're hung over,

00:40.791 --> 00:41.749
that's bad enough.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.418
When you back out
on a mission...

00:43.502 --> 00:45.753
You see, unlike you,
I don't take a bunch of pills,

00:45.838 --> 00:50.341
and then climb in my cockpit so wired
that I can't land the frakking ship.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.722
Starbuck,
you're an embarrassment.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.350
I need you back in the CIC.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.645
It just ain't the same
without you in there,

01:02.730 --> 01:04.063
intimidating the inmates.

01:04.148 --> 01:05.481
No, no.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.901
There are only 12
Cylon models,

01:08.986 --> 01:12.113
but in the entire occupation on
New Caprica, I only saw seven.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.489
Who are the final five?

01:13.574 --> 01:15.366
I can't talk about that.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.910
BALTAR: You have any idea
what it's talking about?

01:17.995 --> 01:21.414
CAPRICA SIX: Most Cylons think the conscious
mind of the Hybrid has simply gone mad

01:21.498 --> 01:24.125
and the vocalizations
we hear are meaningless.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.002
But not everyone
thinks that.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.853
miraculous,
between life and death.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.009
ROSLIN: You mean there's
no food to be salvaged?

02:15.093 --> 02:16.803
What about the good food
we had stored

02:16.887 --> 02:20.306
before we started inadvertently
churning out the contaminated stuff?

02:20.390 --> 02:24.811
Well, the newly processed bad food
went into the depleted storage system.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.145
Everything's tainted.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.482
But Sharon's out finding all
this algae for us to process.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.193
It's tough to choke down,
but it's almost pure protein.

02:32.277 --> 02:37.198
What if Sharon comes back and reports
there is no clear passage to this planet?

02:37.866 --> 02:41.285
Then the question is, Doc,
how long can we survive?

02:41.370 --> 02:44.747
With the rations we've been
on? I'd say seven to 10 days.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.834
ROSLIN:
When is she due back?

02:47.918 --> 02:49.794
She was due
three hours ago.

02:49.878 --> 02:55.508
The radiation levels are high,
but she's strong and she's...

02:57.761 --> 02:59.762

To share?

03:34.965 --> 03:37.508
I told you, Starbuck, I don't have
anything. Get off my back, okay?

03:37.593 --> 03:39.051
Yeah, I saw a protein bar
on your cot.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.219
I gave it to Cottle.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.179
Right. Right after
I gave him head.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.473
Oh, so, what, now I'm a liar? Oh,
I don't know, if the shoe fits.

with this hunger.

you all do all day long,

like fleas on a cat.

Where do you suppose she
takes herself off to, then?

06:22.466 --> 06:25.051
You are not the only one
asking that.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.802
I'm not?

06:27.763 --> 06:29.346
What do you mean?

06:29.431 --> 06:31.265
She's been doing things.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.643

06:37.981 --> 06:39.440

got you, Lieutenant. Watch your step.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.851
CREWMAN 4: Don't move!

07:18.438 --> 07:21.315
There's a way
through the star cluster.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.652
And I found the planet,
on the other side.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.446
I skimmed it,
I took photos.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.950
There's huge swaths of algae,
just like we thought.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.161
It's black.

07:34.246 --> 07:37.289
APOLLO: She's a Cylon. She can
handle a radiation dose that big.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.126
We think.
Someone call Cottle.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.293
I'm fine.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.795
Maybe you are,

07:43.922 --> 07:46.132
but a human might
not be able to make it.

07:46.216 --> 07:50.344
So, then, how do we get tens of
thousands of humans through there?

07:50.720 --> 07:55.015
So we can make it through in two
jumps with a stop right there.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.809
There's no solution
with a single jump?

07:56.893 --> 08:00.146
No, the cluster's too big, and
it's too big to go around, too.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.064
But the civvie ships
aren't shielded enough

08:02.149 --> 08:04.316
to jump in the middle
of all that radiation.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.153
I would say 80% of the
people on board would die.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.988
Can we send Galactica
for food?

08:09.072 --> 08:10.823
And put it where?
What do you mean?

08:10.907 --> 08:12.324
It would take dozens
of return trips.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.326
Each time we'd leave the
fleet vulnerable to attack.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.662
We just can't bring the food
to the people.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.123
What if we bring
the people to the food?

08:19.207 --> 08:20.916
Put the people
on Galactica.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.836
Send the civilian ships
with skeleton crew,

08:23.920 --> 08:25.045
give them
radiation meds.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.674
Except that the radiation would
fry the civvie ships' nav systems.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.135
They wouldn't be able
to see squat on dradis.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.512
There wouldn't even be a way
to calculate a jump out.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.014
It's worse than that.

08:35.098 --> 08:38.017
Once you jump in, the light is
so blinding you begin to drift.

08:38.101 --> 08:42.271
And before you can get your
bearings, you're over there.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.649
APOLLO: No visual contact,
instruments blinded by radiation.

08:45.734 --> 08:49.153
They'd get lost,
they'd burn up.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.784
Pilot ship.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.915
We pair a Raptor
with each civilian ship.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.876
APOLLO: The Raptor navigation systems
are hardened against nuclear strikes.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.544
They could handle
the radiation.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.714
Each Raptor could lead a
civilian ship through the cluster,

09:08.798 --> 09:10.883
then they both
jump out together.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.888
The question is,
how many jumps will it take?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.683
APOLLO: Five round trips.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.353
You heard.
Five round trips.

09:22.854 --> 09:23.979
On our outbound jumps,

09:24.064 --> 09:26.273
we'll each be responsible
for relaying jump coordinates

09:26.358 --> 09:28.776
to our own specific
civilian ship,

09:28.860 --> 09:32.238
nailing them to their jump points
and ensuring they don't drift off.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.406
Sir, are we gonna get fed
when we get there?

09:34.491 --> 09:38.535
Eventually, yes, but only after we
find the algae and get it processed.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.620
(GROANS)

09:40.330 --> 09:41.413
But the truth is that

09:41.498 --> 09:44.625
nausea from the radiation exposure
will take care of our appetites.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.920
You'll all be issued with radiation
badges to track our exposure.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.922
White, like this,
you're okay.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.424
As your exposure increases,
it'll darken.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.927
If it approaches this, then
you'll be pulled from duty.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.595
Keep checking your badges.

09:56.680 --> 10:00.432
It's every pilot's own responsibility
to monitor their own badge.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.767

10:03.436 --> 10:07.106
Remember, we're all flying
solo on this mission.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.483
So that means there'll be
nobody there to bitch-slap you

10:09.567 --> 10:12.778
if you start to get tired or start
seeing little toasters on your wing.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.738
We'll be issuing stims,
so use them.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.782
What? Are you crazy?
We can't use stims.

10:16.866 --> 10:17.825
Kat, do you have a problem?

10:17.909 --> 10:20.202
Stims amp up your metabolism.
We've got nothing to burn.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.122
You put stims in our systems, we're gonna
be flying into the sides of the ships.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.290
Is that true?
They'd mess us up?

10:24.374 --> 10:25.874
You used to like
the stims, Kat.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.918
All right, personal discretion
on the stims.

10:28.003 --> 10:31.588
We're taking the first load of
civilians onboard as we speak.

There's some debate
about it, apparently.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.261
Of course, if I spoke
to the relevant Simon,

he'll actually ascertain
you were at this meeting?

out who you really are,

HOSHI: Yeah. That's it. WOMAN
2: Good to have you back.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.652
MAN 5: All right.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.320
We're with you, sir.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.738
Welcome back.

15:07.824 --> 15:11.285
Enough! Don't you people
have jobs to do?

15:14.789 --> 15:16.373
Welcome back, Colonel.

15:16.457 --> 15:17.499
Admiral.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.674
Apollo, Galactica.
Launch Raptors on your orders.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.678
APOLLO ON RADIO: Shepherds, find your
sheep, stay close and never let them go.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.888
These crews are counting
on us to guide them through.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.432
STARBUCK: Apollo,
Starbuck on station.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.309
KAT ON RADIO: I've got
visual on Chiron.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.311
HOTDOG: Hotdog.
Adriatic in sight.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.604
Okay.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.939
When you jump into the cluster,
you will be disoriented.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.649
Take it one step
at a time.

15:42.734 --> 15:47.279
Find your sheep, work the jump
calculations and get them out.

15:47.363 --> 15:51.325
Remember, we do not stay
beyond our radiation dose limit.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.870
GAETA: Apollo reports
pilots in position, sir.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.039
Initiate jump
on his command.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.206
Galactica will follow.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.416
GAETA: Aye, aye, sir.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.758
Raptors, Apollo.
We jump on my mark.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.051
Three.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.302
Two.
Jumping.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.471
One. Mark.

16:28.738 --> 16:32.866
Whoa! What is this?
I can't see anything.

16:34.786 --> 16:35.786
Frak.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.472
Got you!

16:56.557 --> 16:57.683
Kat, you got yours?

16:57.767 --> 16:59.184
KAT: Affirmative, Apollo.

16:59.268 --> 17:03.146
Only got eyes for the Chiron.
Relaying coordinates.

17:03.231 --> 17:06.024
Squadron, Apollo.
I have Thera Sita.

17:06.109 --> 17:09.319
Relaying jump coordinates
to her right now.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.614
STARBUCK: Apollo, Starbuck.
I got mine.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.366
Frak. I'm just
barely holding on here.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.662
I lost mine. Did anyone see the Adriatic?
She has lost her jump coordinates.

17:18.746 --> 17:19.746
APOLLO: Hotdog, negative.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.415

17:22.583 --> 17:24.835
Hotdog, the Raptor needs
to be under control, man.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.295
Ease up with the stick. This
is not a Viper, it's a Raptor.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.463
Frak it, frak it!

17:28.548 --> 17:30.465
APOLLO: Find her, man!
Get a visual!

17:36.472 --> 17:37.472
(ALARM BLARING)

17:37.557 --> 17:39.933
Apollo, it's Galactica Actual.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.895
You've reached your radiation
dose limit. You've got to jump.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.981
Count us down.
APOLLO: Roger that, Galactica.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.525
No! No, Apollo, please, wait!

17:48.609 --> 17:50.986
Hotdog, listen to me! We
have to get out of here, now!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.905
I know I can find them!
I can find them! Hold on!

17:53.990 --> 17:56.116
Please wait! No!
Starbuck, jump on my mark.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.659
With or without your ships!

17:57.744 --> 18:00.412
Please!
One, two, three.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.372
No! Please! Wait!
Mark!

18:02.457 --> 18:04.750
We can't leave without her!

18:10.798 --> 18:13.008
Frak! Frak!

18:14.677 --> 18:16.720
Jump complete.

18:17.305 --> 18:21.266
Dradis is back online. Ship
reports moderate hull damage.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.060
APOLLO: Galactica, Apollo.
First trip complete.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.271
Raptors, land your birds,

18:26.355 --> 18:30.066
and prepare to jump back for
the second group of civilians.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.822
(ELECTRONIC BEEPING)

18:36.282 --> 18:38.366
We lost the Adriatic.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.328
It's only our first jump.

18:41.412 --> 18:42.746
Yes, it is.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.716
(ALARM BLARING)

18:59.972 --> 19:03.809
Carina, Kat!
Report your location!

19:04.977 --> 19:07.604
Kat, Apollo.
Do you have the Carina?

19:07.688 --> 19:11.149
Negative! Radiation's
pissing on my nav.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.569
I can't see frak!

19:16.948 --> 19:19.282
Okay. Found her!

19:23.913 --> 19:25.330
No! Frak!
APOLLO: Kat!

19:25.414 --> 19:27.040
Kat, report!

19:27.124 --> 19:28.542
Gods damn it!

19:28.835 --> 19:32.295
All right, Kat, Apollo! Time's
up! We're jumping on my mark!

19:32.380 --> 19:35.549
Three, two, one, mark!
Not without the Carina!

19:39.220 --> 19:40.762
I lost her.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.306
I lost her.

20:54.170 --> 20:58.340
APOLLO: All right. We managed to
get another eight ships through.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.676
But we still lost one.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.681
We've got to get better
at tracking our sheep.

21:07.808 --> 21:11.311
Quicker reaction times
out of the jumps.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.942
Racetrack, don't be calling out
coordinates to the wrong ship.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.110
I got mixed up.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.072
Keep checking your instruments
and recheck them.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.199
The instruments are crap.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.372
All right.

21:31.624 --> 21:35.043
That concludes
Outbound Four.

21:35.711 --> 21:39.422
This is Return Four.
One to go.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.385
All right,
get some rest.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.808
Come on.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.608
Here's a report
from the Doc.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.488
A hundred Marines
too weak to work.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.074
Two hundred more
are ready to drop.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.493
That's gonna slow down
the harvest.

22:09.537 --> 22:13.289
The last batch of passengers
kicked up some trouble.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.333
You get these people
to the other side

22:15.418 --> 22:18.962
and they think there's a diner and
a chef waiting to take their order.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.380
I know.

22:21.632 --> 22:25.593
They got to learn we got to process
the thing first, for frak's sake.

22:25.678 --> 22:29.014
Try telling that
to a bunch of empty stomachs.

22:29.098 --> 22:32.809
I hear they're still
eating paper. Is that true?

22:32.893 --> 22:35.186
No. Paper shortage.

23:01.464 --> 23:02.964
Not a good sign.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.093
No, sir.

23:34.205 --> 23:38.625
So while you resurrect, do you
see the faces of the Final Five?

23:39.960 --> 23:42.087
The ones that no one's seen?

23:42.171 --> 23:43.963
Why do you want
to know about them?

23:45.508 --> 23:47.842
I could be a Cylon.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.847
I would stop being a traitor
to one set of people

23:54.850 --> 23:58.228
and be a hero to another,

23:59.855 --> 24:02.023
and have a place to belong.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.612
You would help me
understand my destiny.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.700
Have you seen my face?

24:12.785 --> 24:13.868
Your face?

24:14.703 --> 24:16.371
Yes, my face.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.458
I can't remember.

24:23.170 --> 24:27.465
I've been trying to get it all down on
paper while it's still fresh in my mind,

24:27.550 --> 24:30.343
but nothing much comes out.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.389
It's rubbish.
I can't remember.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.768
Cylons, humans...

24:42.189 --> 24:46.901
We're all just trying
to discover who we are.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.405
Aren't we?

25:02.376 --> 25:04.002
Okay.
Hey, Enzo.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.676
Yeah?

25:16.515 --> 25:18.725
I took the name Louanne
Katraine from a girl

25:18.809 --> 25:21.936
who died two days before
the attack on Caprica.

25:23.981 --> 25:26.608
It got me through
the background checks.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.153
Yeah, times were rough.
Keep going.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.536
I was a drug runner.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.372
Enzo was my supplier.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.835
What do you want?
We were truckers, okay?

25:45.920 --> 25:47.754
We just moved stuff.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.672
People.

25:51.300 --> 25:56.471
You see, some think that, that's the
way that the Cylons infiltrated Caprica.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.016
They seeded themselves
throughout the outer colonies,

26:00.100 --> 26:03.728
and then they used criminals
to get them into the capital.

26:05.814 --> 26:10.485
Anyone who's found guilty of helping
the Cylons is considered a traitor.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.863
We didn't carry Cylons.
How do you know?

26:13.948 --> 26:15.240
Because nobody knew
that they looked like us.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.492
Then how do you know
you didn't?

26:22.998 --> 26:24.040
How do you know?

26:24.124 --> 26:25.500
You think I'm a traitor?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.338
You think I'm a traitor?

26:32.675 --> 26:36.636
No. I don't think
you're a traitor.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.349
You're a smart young woman.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.561
That's what the old man said.

26:45.646 --> 26:49.357
You're just not smart enough
to accept who you are.

26:50.693 --> 26:55.196
You see, you lied your way
into the company of good people.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.372
Starbuck,
don't tell the Admiral.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.457
Please.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.752
Please don't, or I...
Or what?

27:11.422 --> 27:13.798
Please. Just let me
tell him myself.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.926
Please, just let me.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.513
Can you do that?

you're doing?

Yes. I'm here.

28:56.110 --> 28:59.695
Find the hand that lies
in the shadow of the light.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.865
In the eye of the husband
of the eye of the cow.

I don't think anything
it says is nonsense.

29:24.513 --> 29:28.599
The husband of the eye.
The eye of the...

29:30.936 --> 29:31.936

29:33.856 --> 29:38.776
Hera, sometimes referred
to as cow-eyed Hera.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.197
And the husband of Hera...

29:43.282 --> 29:44.657
Is Jupiter.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.367
The Eye of Jupiter.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.703
That's written about
in the ancient texts.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.206

29:52.875 --> 29:56.002
Could there be a connection
between their Gods and ours?

29:57.880 --> 30:00.006
What does it mean?

30:00.716 --> 30:02.383
It's a location.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.511
A planet hidden in
the shadow of light.

30:05.596 --> 30:08.139
Probably a cluster of stars.

30:09.224 --> 30:11.601
That will lead us
to the Eye of Jupiter.

30:14.563 --> 30:19.400
As to the hand hidden
in the shadow of light,

30:21.069 --> 30:23.779
it's probably
some type of artifact.

30:26.408 --> 30:27.408

35:01.516 --> 35:02.516
Damn.

35:04.060 --> 35:08.272
Faru Sadin, this is Kat.
Report your location.

35:15.489 --> 35:16.697
Frak!

35:19.201 --> 35:21.202
(PANTING)

35:46.728 --> 35:49.688
TIGH: Come on, kid.
Come on home.

36:12.254 --> 36:13.254
HOSHI: It's them.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.174
She brought them home.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.346
Galactica, Kat.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.932
Mission accomplished.

37:26.328 --> 37:28.287
They said
you wanted to see me.

37:28.371 --> 37:29.371
Yeah.

37:30.707 --> 37:33.083
I don't think we should
end the way we ended.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.002
Listen.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.798
Everybody is...

37:42.260 --> 37:47.389
Everybody is stuck with the
things that they're not proud of.

37:49.893 --> 37:53.520
And that... That thing
about good people, I...

37:55.023 --> 37:56.523
I didn't mean that.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.611
Yeah, I know.

38:06.368 --> 38:07.368
Here.

38:08.870 --> 38:11.205
Take these. Sleeping pills.

38:15.794 --> 38:16.794
Enough.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.882
So, take them if you want.

38:22.717 --> 38:23.842
Thank you.

38:26.888 --> 38:28.389
I got to go.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.113
Admiral, I...

38:44.739 --> 38:47.074
I know. I'm sorry.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.577
I'm not here to lecture.

38:53.206 --> 38:56.041
I'm letting you know
about a promotion.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.753
I'm making you CAG again.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.172
(MUMBLING)

39:02.257 --> 39:04.925
Sir, you know I'm not
getting out of here, right?

39:05.010 --> 39:06.385
But you earned it.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.807
What you did was harder
than facing a bullet,

39:11.891 --> 39:17.021
and you did it without putting
one other soul in harm's way.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.566
I don't know
if I could've done that.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.361
I wish there was something
more that I could give you.

39:24.446 --> 39:27.948
No. It's good.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.786
I would like to be a CAG
very much.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.456
Thank you.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.759
There's a thing...

39:49.471 --> 39:52.598
A reason why you
might not want to do this.

39:55.310 --> 39:58.395
Kara knows what it is,

39:58.813 --> 40:01.065
but I wanted
to tell you myself.

40:01.483 --> 40:05.360
I don't need to know anything
other than what I already know.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.613
When you were CAG,

40:09.115 --> 40:10.616
you protected your people,

40:11.493 --> 40:14.161
made them feel safe enough
to be brave.

40:16.164 --> 40:19.875
What you were gonna say
doesn't change that.

40:37.060 --> 40:40.437
Are you... Are you staying?

40:41.147 --> 40:44.191
Oh, I'm staying.

40:46.361 --> 40:49.321
I love this sick bay,
in a way.

40:50.198 --> 40:51.198
(LAUGHS)

40:52.200 --> 40:56.286
It reminds me of where
my son, Zak, was born.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.667
Carolanne was so happy.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.921
She was convinced,

41:07.632 --> 41:10.717
both times,
that she was having a girl.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.013
So it was a surprise
at the end.

41:16.224 --> 41:18.934
Did you want a girl, too?

41:21.938 --> 41:23.355
Yeah.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.858
Three's a good
round number.

43:03.289 --> 43:06.166
