00:07.708 --> 00:09.810
CYD: I'm going to tell you
 the story about what happened

00:09.810 --> 00:11.882
the first Christmas
 I lived with Shelby.

00:11.882 --> 00:13.914
It was two days
 before Christmas

00:13.914 --> 00:16.717
and Shelby, Barry and Naldo
 were busy decorating.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.389
Hey look,
Diesel's dressed as Santa.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.753
No, I think he's just wearing
the pelt of his latest victim.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.827
Great job, guys.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.100
Only eight more boxes
of ornaments to put on.

00:32.162 --> 00:35.366
Shelby, I think the tree
has reached critical mass.

00:35.366 --> 00:38.209
Or critical Chris-mass,
if I may.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.312
No? I may not?
Okay.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.745
CYD: You may be wondering
 where I was.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.917
Out shopping for
 Shelby's present.

00:46.917 --> 00:48.879
She always gives
 the most thoughtful,

00:48.879 --> 00:52.083
most perfect,
 most impossible to
 live up to gifts.

00:52.083 --> 00:54.825
Like the year I got her
 a cute sweater,

00:54.825 --> 00:57.958
Shelby made me boxing gloves
 with mistletoe on them.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.131
I mean, they said,
 "Kiss my fist."

01:00.131 --> 01:01.792
How awesome is that?

01:02.793 --> 01:04.765
So the next year
 I upped my game

01:04.765 --> 01:07.268
and got her really
 comfy slippers.

01:07.268 --> 01:10.070
But Shelby rigged my locker
 with a slushie machine.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.274
I gave myself brain freeze
 between every class.

01:13.274 --> 01:16.447
It was glorious.

01:16.447 --> 01:19.480
So the next year I had to
 up my game even more.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.013
I got her a super cute
 collectible stuffed
 cuddle bunny.

01:23.013 --> 01:25.286
But she got me Diesel!

01:26.387 --> 01:27.988

CYD: While I was trying to
 figure out the perfect gift
 to get Shelby,

02:25.015 --> 02:28.249
Barry and Naldo were doing
 some precision calculations
 of their own.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.651
Rotate 20 degrees
up altitude,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.082
four degrees right azimuth.

Renaldo,
what are you doing?
Assimilating nicely.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.003
Hey, are you guys doing
a Winter Wonderland this year?

02:53.003 --> 02:54.645
No, no, no.
We are absolutely not

02:54.645 --> 02:56.347
doing another
Winter Wonderland.

02:56.347 --> 02:58.008
Don't you remember last year?

02:58.008 --> 02:59.850
How could you forget
the elf war?

02:59.850 --> 03:02.283
I try not to remember
bad things.

03:02.283 --> 03:06.086
I only remember
what Chet remembers.

03:06.086 --> 03:09.089
Barry, do you ever wonder
if we only exist
in their minds?

03:09.089 --> 03:11.922
Please, Renaldo,
nothing exists
in their minds.

03:14.225 --> 03:16.597
CYD:
 Holiday shopping
 was a disaster.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.629
How was I ever going
 to get Shelby a gift

03:18.629 --> 03:20.331
as thoughtful as
 what she was getting me

03:20.331 --> 03:22.403
if I didn't know
 what she was getting me?

03:22.403 --> 03:23.874
But then it hit me.

03:23.874 --> 03:26.006
I remembered something
 Barry and Naldo told me.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.279
Sorry, Cyd, I have no idea
what Shelby got you.

03:28.279 --> 03:29.580
Neither do I.

03:29.580 --> 03:31.412
All I know is last
Christmas Eve

03:31.412 --> 03:33.584
a neighbor's package
was accidentally delivered
to the house.

03:33.584 --> 03:35.586
Shelby opened it
by mistake,

03:35.586 --> 03:38.289
and whatever was inside
gave her the idea for
the gift that she got you.

03:38.289 --> 03:40.291
So you see,
I have no idea.

03:42.953 --> 03:45.596
CYD: If only
 I could time travel
 to last Christmas Eve,

03:45.596 --> 03:47.598
I could find out
 what Shelby got me.

03:47.598 --> 03:50.230
But how could I jump
 without her knowing?

03:50.230 --> 03:53.133
But then it hit me!

03:53.133 --> 03:56.166
Only one of us has to think
 of where we're going
 when we jump.

03:56.166 --> 03:59.239
Maybe I could time jump
 with Shelby while
 she was sleeping.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.312
And she'll never know.

04:01.312 --> 04:03.143
What?

04:03.143 --> 04:05.115
Be quiet, Shelby,
I'm trying to sleep!
Oh, sorry, Cyd.

04:09.019 --> 04:10.651
CYD: Only problem was,

04:10.651 --> 04:12.983
I forgot that last year,
 I didn't live with Shelby.

04:12.983 --> 04:15.085
I lived four blocks away.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.160
Cyd?

04:20.160 --> 04:21.791
What's going on?
Nothing.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.565
It's Christmas Eve.

04:24.565 --> 04:28.138
This Christmas Eve.
Wouldn't be any other
Christmas Eve.

04:28.138 --> 04:29.940
That wouldn't make sense.

04:32.443 --> 04:34.305
And then I realized...

04:34.305 --> 04:36.807
Last Christmas Eve,
 none of my stuff was here.

04:36.807 --> 04:39.810
If Shelby saw this,
 she would know what I did.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.482
Shelby!
What?

04:41.482 --> 04:43.484
Check out my Christmas dance.

04:46.317 --> 04:47.818
It's all over here!

04:47.818 --> 04:50.090
All over on this side
of the room.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.593
Don't look away,
you might miss it!

04:52.593 --> 04:54.995

CYD: I could not keep
 this up for long.

05:02.172 --> 05:04.675
CYD: So I had jump jacked
 Shelby to a year earlier,

05:04.675 --> 05:08.439
but I couldn't let her see
 that half of our room
 was completely different.

05:08.439 --> 05:12.112
Don't worry.
 I had the situation
 under control.

Never stop doing it,
it is awesome!

05:21.622 --> 05:23.824
Just trying to get you
pumped up for when
I give you my gift.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.396
Well, it's working!

05:25.396 --> 05:27.428
I mean, normally,
I'm a strict
Christmas Day gal,

05:27.428 --> 05:29.560
but let's exchange gifts.
I'll go get mine.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.561
Oh!

05:31.532 --> 05:33.233
Cyd, what are you doing?

05:33.233 --> 05:35.105
I just really
wanna go first.

05:35.105 --> 05:36.807
Uh, mine's a pretty big gift.

05:36.807 --> 05:39.540
In fact, this is just
phase one of my gift.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.712
Yeah. It's, uh, an amazing,

05:41.712 --> 05:44.675
um, Christmas Eve breakfast!

05:44.675 --> 05:46.577
You're gonna cook?

05:46.577 --> 05:49.920
Last time you
tried to boil water,
you set it on fire.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.122
It was water, Cyd.
And you set it on fire.

05:53.624 --> 05:55.526
Trust me.
It's gonna be great!

05:55.526 --> 05:58.629
CYD: And thus began
 the Christmas of lies.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.394
All I had to do was keep
 Shelby from noticing
 it was last year,

06:03.394 --> 06:05.035
until the
 wrong package arrived.

06:05.035 --> 06:07.297
So I could see
 what gift she got me.

06:07.297 --> 06:10.601
Fortunately, the rest of the
 house was decorated
 exactly the same last year.

06:10.601 --> 06:12.443
I got this.
 It's in the bag.

06:12.443 --> 06:14.575
So what's this breakfast
you're making me?

06:14.575 --> 06:15.776
It's in the bag.

06:17.307 --> 06:19.309
But this is muffin crumbs.

06:19.309 --> 06:21.281
Yeah!
From that hot new

06:21.281 --> 06:24.254
muffin crumb place
on Sixth.

06:24.254 --> 06:26.356
Crumb-believable.

06:26.356 --> 06:29.389
CYD:
 I couldn't believe I made up
 a place with such a good name.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.791
And on Sixth!

06:30.791 --> 06:32.823
That's a good location, too.

06:32.823 --> 06:33.894
(KNOCK ON THE DOOR)

06:33.894 --> 06:35.996
Oh, I'll get it.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.298
CYD: This could be the
 wrong delivery that inspired
 Shelby's gift.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.531
But I had to make sure
 she didn't see it, or she'd
 know we were in the past.

06:40.531 --> 06:44.074
No, no, I'll get it.
You just enjoy your present.

06:44.074 --> 06:46.837
You gotta lick the inside
of the bag. The best crumbs
are the sticky ones.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.346
"Astrid Marcus."

06:59.590 --> 07:01.351
Forget muffin crumbs.

07:01.351 --> 07:04.094
Somebody should open up
a store that sells
bag bottoms.

07:04.094 --> 07:05.456
They are delicious.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.133
CYD: Meanwhile,
 also in the past,

07:13.133 --> 07:15.836
Barry and Naldo were doing
 last Christmas again
 for the first time.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.137
Wait, does that...

07:17.137 --> 07:19.039
Yeah, that's right.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.811
NALDO: Barry,
check it out.

07:20.811 --> 07:22.673
It snowed in the backyard
on Christmas Eve!

07:22.673 --> 07:24.515
Of course, it did.

07:24.515 --> 07:26.747
I built a snow machine
by combining water
and pressurized air

07:26.747 --> 07:28.579
and blasting it
through a Freon tube.

07:28.579 --> 07:30.180
Hah! Barry, come on,

07:30.180 --> 07:33.854
the science
behind snow machines
is dubious at best.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.226
Okay, fine, Renaldo.
How do you explain it?

07:36.226 --> 07:38.729
I seeded the clouds
by shooting a rocket
into the sky

07:38.729 --> 07:40.691
filled with
wintergreen mints.

07:41.892 --> 07:43.994
That is ridiculous.

07:43.994 --> 07:45.866
Then how do you explain this?

07:45.866 --> 07:49.299
(BLOWING)
Okay, that is
pretty minty.

07:49.299 --> 07:53.203
Regardless of how it got here,
this snow is perfect for my
Winter Wonderland.

07:53.203 --> 07:55.676
I think it's really cool
that you're doing this
for the neighborhood.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.678
It's so unlike you.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.449
It's a social experiment
to manipulate the innocent
during Christmas time.

07:59.449 --> 08:01.552
Oh, that's very like you.

08:01.552 --> 08:03.413
I will test the limits
of Christmas cheer

08:03.413 --> 08:06.486
by taking two subjects
and seeing if their
holiday spirit

08:06.486 --> 08:08.519
can withstand
the dark side
of human nature.

08:08.519 --> 08:11.522
All I need are two pure,
untainted subjects.

08:11.522 --> 08:13.924
I am pure.
I am untainted.

08:13.924 --> 08:15.666
Whoa!

08:15.666 --> 08:19.369
In fairness, I texted them
to walk over here
and say that.

08:19.369 --> 08:21.972
BARRY: Bret, Chet, thank you
so much for recruiting
all your friends

08:21.972 --> 08:25.035
and helping make my
Winter Wonderland
so merry and bright.

08:25.035 --> 08:27.077
I'm spreading
holiday cheer.

08:27.077 --> 08:28.108

08:28.108 --> 08:29.840
I'm spreading germs.

08:33.143 --> 08:35.145
Now, watch
as my experiment

08:35.145 --> 08:37.988
sets the Candy Cane elves
and the Snowflake elves
against each other

08:37.988 --> 08:40.150
and destroys
their holiday spirit.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.953
Chet, I am making you
my head elf.

08:43.953 --> 08:48.328
Say, don't you think
your brother's twinkle lights
look a little crooked?

08:48.328 --> 08:50.060
Yeah.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.462
Straighten your twinkles,
Bret.

08:52.462 --> 08:53.934
Sorry, Chet.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.567
Bret.

08:56.567 --> 08:59.509
You gonna let your brother
talk about your twinkles
like that?

08:59.509 --> 09:01.642
He's acting like he's
head elf or something.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.443
I wouldn't take that
if I were you.

09:04.675 --> 09:07.177
Straighten your
own twinkles, Candy Cane.

09:09.319 --> 09:11.551
You Snowflakes think
you're better than us?

09:13.684 --> 09:15.025
Yeah, you do.

09:16.486 --> 09:18.689
Yeah, I do.

09:18.689 --> 09:20.530
You're not better than us!

09:20.530 --> 09:21.832

09:22.893 --> 09:25.495
Wow. Never in
my wildest dreams

09:25.495 --> 09:27.798
did I imagine my experiment
would work this well.

09:27.798 --> 09:31.902
I mean, human nature has
overwhelmed the holiday spirit
in a matter of seconds.

09:31.902 --> 09:34.805
Barry, are you sure you
want to do this at
Christmas time?

09:34.805 --> 09:36.647
You're gonna end up
on the naughty list.

09:36.647 --> 09:39.680
When Santa starts making
Alpha Particle
X-Ray Spectrometers,

09:39.680 --> 09:41.511
I'll start caring about
the naughty list.

09:41.511 --> 09:43.113
Whoa, Santa,

09:43.113 --> 09:46.216
I do not know this man,
I have never
seen him in my life.

09:46.216 --> 09:47.788
We're still in for that

 was going to be delivered,

What? Why not?

10:18.388 --> 10:20.220

 the bedroom, she'd figure out
 we were in the past.

 that's being delivered

10:23.924 --> 10:25.756
she'd figure out
 I jump jacked her!

10:27.497 --> 10:28.759
Cyd, what is going on?

10:28.759 --> 10:30.701
Phase two is going on.

10:30.701 --> 10:33.433
It's in, uh,
the living room,

10:33.433 --> 10:34.765
and it's under something.

10:34.765 --> 10:37.237
Oops, I've given it
all away. (LAUGHS)

10:37.237 --> 10:38.669

10:44.444 --> 10:45.846
"Norm Marcus."

10:45.846 --> 10:48.278
Wow, Cyd.
This hat is amazing.

10:48.278 --> 10:49.649
Thank you so much.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.551
I had no idea
 where she found that.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.824
I'm pretty sure it was just
 one of Chet's socks.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.387
Look, Cyd.
I'm completely digging this.

10:57.387 --> 11:00.891
But it's like almost 11:00.
I just wanna get dressed
before phase three.

11:00.891 --> 11:02.432
Shelby, wait!

11:06.566 --> 11:10.540
I forgot this was the
Christmas Norm gave up
and got everybody marbles!

11:12.803 --> 11:14.374
What happened?

11:14.374 --> 11:15.645
Everything is gone.

11:15.645 --> 11:17.377

clean clothes and food trash!

11:20.080 --> 11:21.381
I can see the floor.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.054
Why can I see the floor?

11:24.054 --> 11:27.387
CYD: I had to come up
 with an explanation
 and I had to do it quick.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.789
We were robbed?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.390
And I had to
 make it convincing.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.621
We were robbed!

11:36.827 --> 11:38.598
Barry,
you gotta see this.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.071
I know. Clearly,
the negative aspects
of human nature

11:41.071 --> 11:44.004
are stronger than the
altruism engendered
by holiday cheer.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.535
That's what I'm
trying to tell you!

11:45.535 --> 11:47.838
But in different
easier-to-understand words.

(CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING)

11:57.918 --> 11:59.389

11:59.389 --> 12:01.651

an elf war.

12:01.651 --> 12:03.123
Well, at least
it will be short.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.295

12:06.797 --> 12:08.228
Nothing?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.529
If we're not gonna laugh,
then why are we here?

12:11.001 --> 12:13.934
Those Candy Canes think
they're better than us.

12:13.934 --> 12:17.167
But we'll show them who rules
this Winter Wonderland!

ALL: Yeah!

12:24.574 --> 12:26.646
Barry, you have to
do something.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.418
You're right, Renaldo,
I've proven my point.

12:28.418 --> 12:30.480
No need for actual carnage.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.853
You've all been

only take your stuff?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.901
You wanted them

What if they're
polite robbers?

13:41.351 --> 13:44.624
What if they were
brought up right?
Then they wouldn't be robbers.

It's Christmas Eve.
Why aren't you at home
with your family?

14:09.819 --> 14:12.282
I was in too deep.
 I had to come clean.

14:12.282 --> 14:13.924
Because my family
is not at home.

14:13.924 --> 14:16.156
They're on a trip to New York.
And they forgot me.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.787
Or I could just keep lying.

14:18.989 --> 14:21.431
Oh, Cyd, that is terrible!

14:21.431 --> 14:24.364
I'm gonna call your father
on his cell, so he knows
that you're okay.

Mom, Dad.
I'm so glad you're back.

14:31.701 --> 14:33.373
Something terrible
has happened.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.745
I know.
We talked to Cyd.
She told us all about it.

14:35.745 --> 14:37.377
Well, don't worry,
I handled it.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.708
I called the police.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.280
Shelby, why would you
call the police?

14:40.280 --> 14:42.082
Because they took
all of Cyd's stuff!

14:42.082 --> 14:45.055
I know! And they didn't
take Cyd. It's terrible.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.818
Dad, it's a good thing
they didn't take Cyd.

14:48.818 --> 14:51.992
Oh, I don't know.
I think Cyd would have
really benefited from it.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.694
And they really
want to spend
Christmas with her.

14:56.026 --> 14:57.827
But they're criminals!

14:57.827 --> 15:01.101
Oh, sweetie.
They aren't criminals.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.503
They're good,
hardworking people.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.576
They're just
a little ruder than us.

15:06.576 --> 15:08.238
You really didn't need to
call the police over this.

15:08.238 --> 15:09.839
It was an honest mistake.

15:09.839 --> 15:12.782
Dad, what they did is wrong.
They have to pay for it.

15:12.782 --> 15:16.316
Honey, I'm sure they
feel terrible about
leaving Cyd behind.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.989
They must have been planning
this getaway for months.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.653
What is wrong with you guys?

15:28.358 --> 15:30.660
CYD: So I told Shelby
 we were robbed,

15:30.660 --> 15:33.333
and told her parents that
 my folks left me home
 while they went to New York.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.967
But I had to stay in the past
 long enough to see
 the wrong package delivered,

15:36.967 --> 15:38.969
so I'd know what Shelby
 was getting me this year.

15:38.969 --> 15:41.371
I had to get her a gift
 just as thoughtful

15:41.371 --> 15:43.443
to show her how much
 her friendship means to me.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.015

15:45.015 --> 15:48.548

 and answer that phone
 before my dad did.

It's Norm Marcus.

16:06.436 --> 16:07.897
Also an adult man.

16:09.439 --> 16:10.670
What are you doing?

16:10.670 --> 16:13.473
It's guy stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.675
So you probably already
know this by now,

16:15.675 --> 16:18.048
but you forgot to
take Cyd on your trip.

16:18.048 --> 16:20.380
Yep, I remembered
my toothbrush,
forgot my daughter.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.981
These things happen.
Thanks for calling.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.715
Ed, are you feeling okay?
You sound kinda funny.

16:25.715 --> 16:27.457
There's nothing funny
about this, Norm!

16:27.457 --> 16:29.389
I left my kid
back in Portland.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.592
Don't worry,
we're coming home right now.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.564
We'll watch after Cyd

16:34.564 --> 16:36.126
You're my main man, Norm.

16:37.027 --> 16:38.528
Wow.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.400
I've always wanted to be
someone's main man.

16:55.785 --> 16:58.548
It's okay.
It's okay.

16:58.548 --> 17:00.390
You'll be home soon.

17:02.152 --> 17:04.354
It won't go back on.

17:04.354 --> 17:06.195
It won't go back on!

17:08.627 --> 17:10.730
This is horrible.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.862
You ruined Christmas, Bret!

17:12.862 --> 17:14.964
No, you ruined
Christmas, Chet!

17:14.964 --> 17:18.608
No, I ruined Christmas.

17:18.608 --> 17:21.941
I pitted you
against each other
for selfish reasons.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.772
It doesn't matter
whether you're one

17:23.772 --> 17:26.616
of Chet's Candy Canes
or Bret's Snowflakes,

17:26.616 --> 17:30.120
because Christmas is
about coming together.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.882
Like this gingerbread boy

17:32.882 --> 17:37.127
and this reindeer
coming together to make...

17:38.988 --> 17:41.461
Well, not this.
This is a holiday abomination.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.235

forgive me, but I'm sorry.

We forgive you, Barry.

as a tissue.

Of course they do, Barry.
It's Christmas.

18:01.351 --> 18:02.712
Wow.

18:02.712 --> 18:04.914
I guess I was wrong.

18:04.914 --> 18:08.518
I guess the holiday spirit
really is stronger than the
dark side of human nature.

18:08.518 --> 18:10.820
But the dark side
is pretty strong, too.

18:12.021 --> 18:13.623

 to Shelby's house
 as fast as I could,

18:27.006 --> 18:29.078
but events had
 spun out of control.

18:29.078 --> 18:30.240
I don't know why she...

Why are the
police here?

what those horrible people
did to you.

18:35.185 --> 18:36.746
Honey, it was
a simple mistake.

18:36.746 --> 18:39.149
I called them, and they're
coming back for Cyd.

18:39.149 --> 18:41.591
Cyd, run!
Go to the woods where
they'll never find you.

18:41.591 --> 18:43.022
I'll bring you snacks!

18:44.254 --> 18:45.625
Hold on, hold on.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.726
Who's coming back for her?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.698
The robbers.
Cyd's parents.

18:48.698 --> 18:50.630
Your parents robbed you?

18:51.601 --> 18:53.233
Can you describe your parents?

18:54.534 --> 18:56.266
CYD: Well, it was over.

18:56.266 --> 18:58.708
There's no way I could give
 my parents up to the police.

18:58.708 --> 19:00.510
My dad's about this tall,
dark hair.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.013
Cyd, what are you
talking about?

19:04.013 --> 19:05.675
You're right,
this whole thing
has gone too far.

19:05.675 --> 19:07.717
I'll explain everything.

19:07.717 --> 19:11.050
But first, while I was gone,
have any packages
been delivered?

19:11.050 --> 19:13.653
Just this one, but
it was delivered
to the wrong address.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.585
CYD: And there it was.

19:15.585 --> 19:18.588
My whole reason
 for coming back to
 last Christmas Eve.

19:20.089 --> 19:22.962
It's beautiful.

19:25.835 --> 19:27.367
Cyd, wait,

19:27.367 --> 19:30.640
this is the package that
gave me the idea for...

19:30.640 --> 19:32.402
What is going on?
Are we back in...

19:32.402 --> 19:34.043
Yeah, we are.

19:37.247 --> 19:39.249
I'm sorry, Shelby.

19:39.249 --> 19:41.411
I was trying to figure out
what you gave me
for Christmas,

19:41.411 --> 19:44.083
so I jump jacked you
while you were sleeping.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.755
You jump jacked me?

19:45.755 --> 19:47.156
"Jump jacking"?

19:47.156 --> 19:48.658
Is that a thing
we should be worried about?

19:48.658 --> 19:51.491
I don't know, honey.
I'm looking it up right now.

19:53.523 --> 19:56.125
Your gifts are always
so thoughtful, Shelby.

19:56.125 --> 19:58.728
You're the one person
in the world who means
the most to me.

19:58.728 --> 20:02.602
And just once I wanted
to get you a gift that
showed you that.

20:02.602 --> 20:05.074
Because you're my best friend.

20:05.074 --> 20:09.138
"And then Shelby and I hugged
and time traveled
back to the present.

that would make you feel

20:21.120 --> 20:22.992
the way your gifts
make me feel.

20:24.153 --> 20:25.755
So I wrote you this.

20:27.797 --> 20:29.198
Merry Christmas, Shelby.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.732
Cyd. I love it.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.365
A story about how much
our friendship means to you,

20:35.365 --> 20:38.007
it's the best gift
you could have ever given me.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.613
Now I'm kind of embarrassed
to give you what I got you.

20:43.613 --> 20:46.916
I mean, it's never gonna
live up to what you gave me.

20:50.079 --> 20:53.252
Shelbs?
Is that a bathtub
full of chocolate?

20:54.584 --> 20:56.586
I don't know where to start.

20:56.586 --> 20:57.957
At the bottom.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.689
There's marshmallows
down there.

21:01.531 --> 21:03.293
Merry Christmas, Cyd.

21:03.293 --> 21:05.094
Merry Christmas, Shelby.

21:12.402 --> 21:13.803
What's this?

21:13.803 --> 21:15.945
An alternate ending?

21:15.945 --> 21:18.578
Your gifts are always
so thoughtful, Shelby.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.250
You're the one person
in the world who means
the most to me.

21:21.250 --> 21:24.183
And just once I wanted to
get you a gift that
showed you that.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.285
I know you love me!

21:26.285 --> 21:27.887
Can't get mad at that!

21:27.887 --> 21:29.489
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

21:31.521 --> 21:33.723
♪ Christmas dance
 is the dance

21:33.723 --> 21:35.995
♪ Do that dance
 Christmas dance ♪

21:54.143 --> 21:55.184
Whoo!

21:55.184 --> 21:56.185
BOTH: Whoo!

22:11.861 --> 22:13.332
Why did she change
that ending?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.504
It is awesome.
