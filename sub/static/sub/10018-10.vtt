WEBVTT

00:06.796 --> 00:08.427
Previously on E.R.

00:08.428 --> 00:10.952
It was my fault that she went sour.

00:10.953 --> 00:12.715
How many young mothers
have you killed, Doug?

00:12.716 --> 00:15.317
I really wasn't planning
on hiring third-years for my studies.

00:15.318 --> 00:18.918
Jen and Rachel. They're at a hospital.
I gotta catch a train.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.294
- She's a terrible driver.
- But I was driving.

00:21.295 --> 00:23.106
You fell in love with him?

00:23.107 --> 00:24.674
I didn't mean to.

00:26.783 --> 00:29.777
"A Miracle Happens Here"

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:41.770 --> 00:44.308
It's freezing out there, babe.

00:49.695 --> 00:51.153
Carol?

00:58.162 --> 01:01.163
- What are you doing?
- The furnace went out in the night.

01:01.332 --> 01:03.870
I tried to start the pilot,
but I think it's shot.

01:04.043 --> 01:07.412
- It's below zero in here.
- It's not so bad when you start moving.

01:07.588 --> 01:10.126
There's frost on the blankets.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.921
Thought you said we weren't gonna
use that fireplace...

01:14.094 --> 01:16.087
...until the chimney sweep
checked it out.

01:16.263 --> 01:18.754
No, look.
I just have to pull this thing.

01:22.144 --> 01:25.976
Come on. Let's just go out
and get some breakfast.

01:26.565 --> 01:29.483
We'll never get someone to come
to open it before Christmas.

01:29.652 --> 01:32.273
Let's just have Christmas at my place.

01:32.446 --> 01:36.147
- At least I have heat and plumbing.
- I've got plumbing. Almost.

01:36.325 --> 01:38.484
I wanted to wake up here
on Christmas morning.

01:38.661 --> 01:41.199
You know, the tree
was gonna look so beautiful.

01:41.372 --> 01:44.907
So it's chilly. We'll put something
under the door to stop the draft.

01:45.084 --> 01:47.706
That's not a draft.
That's a gale-force wind.

01:47.879 --> 01:50.002
- We'll get pneumonia.
- Put on some socks.

01:50.173 --> 01:53.376
Look, old houses are chilly.
Some...

01:54.886 --> 01:58.302
Some houses need snow shovels
in the parlor?

02:45.562 --> 02:47.520
Ladies and gentlemen,
from the fourth floor:

02:47.690 --> 02:50.228
The Recovery Room Choraliers.

02:50.401 --> 02:52.892
Recovery has way too much time
on their hands.

02:53.070 --> 02:54.897
Well, thanks again.
You guys are great.

02:55.072 --> 02:57.314
- We can't wait to hear you folks.
- Us folks?

02:57.491 --> 02:58.985
4:00. Up on our floor.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.737
- You promised.
- Who promised?

03:00.911 --> 03:04.078
- Carol Hathaway. See you then.
- I'm sorry I'm gonna miss Carol's solo.

03:04.248 --> 03:06.241
Ever heard her sing?
She'll need your help.

03:06.417 --> 03:08.374
I'm off at 3
and I got the kids to buy for.

03:08.544 --> 03:09.919
I can't carry a tune.

03:10.087 --> 03:12.922
- So who's representing the docs?
- You need a consult, right?

03:13.090 --> 03:15.795
I believe the dulcet baritones
of Mark Greene...

03:15.968 --> 03:18.839
...would be a fine addition
to any ensemble.

03:19.013 --> 03:22.845
- That's what he gets for being late.
- He's at the attorney's this morning.

03:23.017 --> 03:25.140
Not letting any grass grow
under that split-up.

03:25.311 --> 03:27.517
Why didn't they wait
till after the holidays?

03:27.688 --> 03:29.396
No, the hospital attorney.

03:29.565 --> 03:32.602
It's his deposition on
the O'Brien wrongful death suit.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.935
The pregnant woman last winter?

03:35.113 --> 03:37.782
In case his holidays
weren't cheerful enough.

03:38.116 --> 03:42.030
The important thing is
to stay calm and stick to the facts.

03:42.203 --> 03:43.318
I am calm.

03:43.955 --> 03:47.122
Well, then maybe you should
take off your coat.

03:47.375 --> 03:50.329
- Sure.
- Mark, this is gonna be a long process.

03:50.503 --> 03:53.173
It could be another year
before we reach a settlement.

03:53.340 --> 03:56.257
- Or go to trial.
- We'll try to avoid that.

03:56.426 --> 03:58.300
And why is that again?

03:58.470 --> 04:00.628
If there's no obvious
breach of standard.

04:00.805 --> 04:04.637
If the injuries are inflammatory,
like leaving a newborn motherless...

04:04.810 --> 04:06.220
...we'd still prefer to settle.

04:06.394 --> 04:10.392
And if we settle, it goes
on my record permanently?

04:11.108 --> 04:15.152
Looks better than losing a
1.5 million judgment at trial.

04:18.031 --> 04:22.029
- I gotta use the men's room.
- Back there.

04:27.624 --> 04:30.246
Whoa, hey, hey, little guy.

04:32.921 --> 04:34.581
Mr. O'Brien.

04:35.507 --> 04:37.167
Dr. Greene.

04:37.509 --> 04:38.968
He's doing well.

04:40.512 --> 04:42.386
Yes, he is.

04:44.016 --> 04:47.017
Come on, Mark. They're ready to begin.

04:53.734 --> 04:56.486
- What is this?
- "Living Nativity on Ice" vs. Zamboni.

04:56.654 --> 04:59.821
First Korean Baptist Youth Group
rehearsing at the Skate on State.

04:59.991 --> 05:03.027
Zamboni driver plowed right
into the manger. Six injured, I think.

05:03.202 --> 05:05.444
- What's the bullet on this one?
- Multiple trauma.

05:05.621 --> 05:09.489
Pain in legs, rib and head.
Vitals stable. LOC for two minutes.

05:09.667 --> 05:12.075
GCS 15.
Moves extremities times four now.

05:12.253 --> 05:14.542
Okay, get X-ray down here
and do a CT on her head.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.541
- Next, Suzie?
- Check out the Lamb.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.922
Put the Virgin Mary in 3.

05:20.053 --> 05:23.054
Looks like partial thickness burns
to forearms and hands.

05:23.222 --> 05:24.966
I didn't even wanna be a lamb!

05:25.141 --> 05:27.715
Let's get some saline dressing.
How'd she get burned?

05:27.894 --> 05:29.518
The Zamboni shoots out hot water.

05:29.687 --> 05:32.523
- Lucky she landed flat on the ice.
- It hurts!

05:32.690 --> 05:35.727
75 Demerol, 25 Vistaril.
I'll be right back.

05:35.902 --> 05:39.236
- Somebody help my son.
- Can you feel this? Wiggle your fingers.

05:39.406 --> 05:42.490
Ma'am, did he lose consciousness? No?
Come here. What's your name?

05:42.659 --> 05:44.865
I'm a Wiseman. Did they have names?

05:45.036 --> 05:47.741
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
- Right you are. There you go.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.788
Okay. Take a seat.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.867
Tell me you weren't using
a real infant.

05:52.043 --> 05:55.128
- Jesus was a doll.
- Thank you. Who's this?

05:55.297 --> 06:00.255
Zamboni driver. Fell five feet
onto the ice. LOC on the scene.

06:00.427 --> 06:03.796
- Smell that breath!
- Merry Christmas.

07:36.608 --> 07:38.731
You wanna observe
this morning's clamp-and-run?

07:38.902 --> 07:40.230
Yep. I missed your last two.

07:40.403 --> 07:42.977
And you didn't finish last night's
discharge summaries?

07:43.156 --> 07:46.525
I'll catch up after surgery.
Plus, I implied to Macy I'd be in there.

07:46.702 --> 07:47.900
- Macy?
- Patient's wife.

07:48.078 --> 07:51.494
They were nervous last night. He's
got a history of thoracic aneurysm...

07:51.665 --> 07:54.915
...but he thought his backache was
from putting up Christmas lights.

07:55.085 --> 07:57.956
Which you chatted about
instead of finishing the charts.

07:58.130 --> 08:01.415
So this morning you're gonna do
what you should've done last night.

08:01.592 --> 08:04.593
- But the patient-
- The patient won't notice you're not there.

08:04.762 --> 08:08.296
Carter, this is not a social hour.
This is surgery.

08:08.474 --> 08:09.968
This is surgery.

08:10.601 --> 08:13.804
Star of the East is heading up
for a tooth reimplantation.

08:13.979 --> 08:16.850
You're overreacting. It's just
a couple of Christmas carols.

08:17.024 --> 08:19.729
- I don't know any.
- Everybody knows Jingle Bells.

08:19.902 --> 08:23.105
- Never heard of it.
- And I can't sing in public.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.403
- Why?
- I hate it when people stare at me.

08:25.574 --> 08:27.152
Oh, I can tell.

08:27.326 --> 08:29.948
Things were pretty wild
around here for a while.

08:30.121 --> 08:31.829
It seems under control now.

08:31.998 --> 08:35.366
How about with you?
How did your deposition go?

08:35.543 --> 08:37.701
Hey, Mark, that's the spirit!
How about 4:00?

08:37.879 --> 08:40.998
4:00? I can't make it.

08:41.174 --> 08:43.462
Miracle none of the kids
were critically hurt.

08:43.634 --> 08:46.172
You know, the cops are charging
the driver right now?

08:46.345 --> 08:48.671
They can charge him with a DUl
on a Zamboni?

08:48.848 --> 08:50.639
No, ZUl.

08:50.975 --> 08:54.593
I gave her a T-bond last Christmas.
She accuses me of not being romantic.

08:54.771 --> 08:55.969
But thinking long term.

08:56.147 --> 08:58.816
That's exactly what I said.
A diamond may be forever...

08:58.983 --> 09:03.230
...but a 10-year maturity at six percent
is not chopped liver, right?

09:03.404 --> 09:06.489
This year I had a brainstorm-

09:06.658 --> 09:07.986
Damn.

09:08.159 --> 09:13.070
Bender, could you do me a favor,
open me up a new brush? Thanks.

09:13.248 --> 09:17.080
This year on Christmas morning,
I'm getting her 10 shares of AT&T.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.410
- It's Benton.
- Right.

09:19.588 --> 09:22.672
Next day, she gets 20 shares
of General Electric.

09:22.841 --> 09:27.004
On the third day, 30 shares of Dupont.
On the fourth day...

09:27.179 --> 09:29.088
Wait, you gotta repeat this for Carl.

09:29.264 --> 09:32.099
Later, please.
I'm here to tell you we can all relax.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.723
It seems that our patient
has had second thoughts...

09:34.895 --> 09:38.180
...and he has withdrawn his consent
for the procedure.

09:38.357 --> 09:42.224
Doesn't he realize he was our last chance
to beat the clock before the new year?

09:42.402 --> 09:43.945
Can we change his mind back?

09:44.112 --> 09:47.528
Well, actually, Dr. Benton and I
are gonna find out right now.

09:47.699 --> 09:51.033
- If you'd care to join me.
- Sure.

09:53.372 --> 09:55.863
That's a pretty nasty cut
you've got there, Mr. Calus.

09:56.041 --> 09:59.042
Stan. It's my own fault.

09:59.211 --> 10:02.248
I've been carving the toys by hand
for a million years.

10:02.423 --> 10:05.210
Business is so hectic,
I went to a power jig and router...

10:05.384 --> 10:09.298
...for some of the more popular items,
like the rolling ducks on a stick.

10:09.472 --> 10:12.556
I love those.
What a great job, making toys.

10:12.725 --> 10:15.512
I got rich and fat
without even asking for it.

10:15.853 --> 10:17.846
Sometimes, though,
I miss the old days.

10:18.022 --> 10:22.731
Just me and my old lady packing up
the VW and hitting the craft fairs.

10:23.194 --> 10:27.274
I got a crew working around the clock,
still can't keep up with the back orders.

10:27.448 --> 10:29.571
Well, this hand's gonna slow you down.

10:29.742 --> 10:32.031
We're lucky we're down
to shipping and handling.

10:32.203 --> 10:35.038
Hate to disappoint any kids.

10:35.206 --> 10:38.077
When was the last time
you had a tetanus shot?

10:39.544 --> 10:41.038
It's been ages.

10:41.212 --> 10:44.462
Well, the doctor's probably
gonna want you to have one.

10:45.258 --> 10:47.879
You would make a great Santa.

10:48.678 --> 10:54.017
- I bet you hear that pretty often, huh?
- This time of year.

10:56.686 --> 11:00.138
It goes with the territory. If you're
developing cutting-edge techniques...

11:00.315 --> 11:02.557
...you better learn how
to sell it to the masses.

11:02.734 --> 11:07.692
I know it's a pain in the ass, but if
you find a simple metaphor for people...

11:07.864 --> 11:10.486
...you can help define
the procedure for yourself.

11:10.659 --> 11:13.446
- I can imagine.
- It was the same with endarterectomies.

11:13.620 --> 11:16.289
Nobody knew of them.
Nobody wanted one.

11:16.456 --> 11:19.623
At first, I shied away from the
Roto-Rooter metaphor as too crass.

11:19.793 --> 11:22.284
But in the long run,
that's what people can understand.

11:22.462 --> 11:25.666
Why don't you see if you can get
the Chamberlains to understand.

11:25.841 --> 11:27.833
- I'll do my best.
- Here we go.

11:28.010 --> 11:32.054
Mr. Chamberlain. I'd like you to meet
Dr. Benton. He works with me.

11:32.222 --> 11:34.298
Pleased to meet you.

11:37.811 --> 11:41.180
Elderly victim of a carjacking
coming in. Head trauma with ALOC.

11:41.356 --> 11:43.314
How nice. Here you go.

11:43.484 --> 11:46.687
- Is this my Christmas bonus?
- Hearty handshake and a "job well done"?

11:46.862 --> 11:50.148
No, that's a check for my share
of tonight's Christmas party.

11:50.324 --> 11:51.652
I love it when the docs pay.

11:51.825 --> 11:54.613
Especially when we guilt them
into booking the Knickerbocker.

11:54.787 --> 11:57.492
- Is everybody dressing up?
- I'm gonna wash behind my ears.

11:57.665 --> 11:58.910
They're pulling up now.

11:59.083 --> 12:02.701
Listen, I noticed you signed up
for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

12:02.878 --> 12:05.001
- I don't mind working then.
- Me either.

12:05.172 --> 12:08.506
Kerry Weaver made the same offer,
but Jen has got Rachel in Dayton...

12:08.676 --> 12:10.918
...and I won't get her back
until Christmas night.

12:11.095 --> 12:14.179
- So I'd just as soon work.
- If you change your mind...

12:15.099 --> 12:17.424
- Carjack victim?
- Unidentified female.

12:17.602 --> 12:20.353
Pulled from her car at the corner
of Roosevelt and Ashland.

12:20.521 --> 12:22.929
Some Salvation Army bell ringer
saw the whole thing.

12:23.107 --> 12:27.271
Said she hit her head on the curb
pretty hard. BP is 160/120.

12:27.445 --> 12:29.853
She's awake en route,
but disoriented.

12:30.031 --> 12:34.527
We got two IVs of normal saline,
O-215 liters by mask.

12:34.702 --> 12:40.408
All right, let's do it on my count.
Gently. One, two, three.

12:41.459 --> 12:45.042
Cross-table C-spine,
and get a head CT.

12:45.213 --> 12:47.336
Gonna be a sore little lady
at Christmas Mass.

12:47.507 --> 12:50.876
I don't think this little old lady
goes to Mass.

12:52.470 --> 12:55.222
- What's that?
- She's a survivor.

12:55.390 --> 12:58.059
- Of what?
- Concentration camp.

13:00.353 --> 13:03.105
All right, let's get a CBC,
type and hold.

13:03.273 --> 13:05.064
Spin a crit,
dip the urine for heme...

13:05.233 --> 13:07.855
...update her tetanus
and hang a gram of Ancef.

13:08.028 --> 13:12.191
- The technique you gave consent to is-
- I don't know techniques.

13:12.366 --> 13:16.862
Macy said she wants to wait,
and that's fine by me.

13:17.037 --> 13:20.821
- Macy is your wife?
- Well, maybe we should talk to Macy.

13:20.999 --> 13:22.707
- Be my guest.
- I don't blame you.

13:22.876 --> 13:25.747
- You have every right to have cold feet.
- Carter?

13:25.921 --> 13:29.871
Dr. Benton, Dr. Vucelich. I just bumped
into Macy in the cafeteria having coffee.

13:30.050 --> 13:33.253
I told her that she's not the first
spouse to have second thoughts...

13:33.429 --> 13:34.804
...on a day of major surgery.

13:34.972 --> 13:37.178
- I feel like a fool.
- You're not.

13:37.349 --> 13:41.928
Flip-flopping this way and that.
I guess I'm pretty much scared to death.

13:42.104 --> 13:43.931
I hope you don't think
I'm crazy, honey.

13:44.106 --> 13:46.478
But after talking to Dr. Carter...

13:46.650 --> 13:50.434
I know. You're not a doctor yet.
But I feel so much better.

13:50.613 --> 13:54.445
So if it's not too late,
can we get on with the surgery?

13:54.617 --> 13:57.452
Yes, ma'am. We certainly can.

13:57.620 --> 14:01.368
- Is Mr. Carter free to join us?
- Yes, I am.

14:02.124 --> 14:05.078
- Do you know where you are?
- Good news for her.

14:05.253 --> 14:08.918
The police have found a car matching
the description off the 290...

14:09.090 --> 14:10.584
...in a snow bank near Berkeley.

14:10.758 --> 14:12.917
If she's Hanna Steiner,
she's got her car back.

14:13.094 --> 14:17.471
- Hanna? Are you Hanna Steiner?
- Yes.

14:17.640 --> 14:22.267
You're in a hospital. You were pulled
from your car at a stoplight.

14:22.812 --> 14:26.940
We're just gonna check you out,
make sure everything's all right.

14:27.108 --> 14:30.311
You need to stay calm.
You've been hit in the head.

14:30.487 --> 14:32.978
- What about Tirzah?
- Tirzah?

14:33.156 --> 14:37.485
The baby. Oh, my God.
The baby. The baby.

14:37.661 --> 14:39.819
- What baby?
- My granddaughter.

14:39.996 --> 14:44.326
She was in the car.
She was in the car seat.

14:44.501 --> 14:47.751
- Is she okay?
- They didn't say anything a baby.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.581
- Is she-
- Call the police.

14:49.756 --> 14:52.543
- Oh, no. Tirzah.
- Ms. Steiner.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.840
Try and stay calm and lie still.

14:55.011 --> 14:59.009
- The police will do everything they can.
- Get me the police dispatcher again.

14:59.182 --> 15:02.018
- Try and relax.
- It's about the carjacker.

15:02.185 --> 15:03.845
Breathe easy.

15:09.902 --> 15:12.737
She's refused the Ativan
and doesn't wanna go for a CT.

15:12.905 --> 15:15.822
I think she's still hoping
to hear some good news.

15:15.991 --> 15:17.154
Me too.

15:18.077 --> 15:19.156
Any news?

15:19.328 --> 15:21.451
Not yet.
We're still trying to reach your son.

15:21.622 --> 15:23.780
That won't do any good.
They live too far out.

15:23.958 --> 15:27.243
Are you sure you don't want Ativan?
It'll calm you down.

15:27.419 --> 15:32.247
- I never should have driven with her.
- We need to finish your evaluation.

15:32.424 --> 15:38.261
If you go for a CT, I promise I'll come
find you as soon as we hear anything.

15:39.223 --> 15:42.307
You really need a CAT scan.

15:42.476 --> 15:43.887
Like a loch in kop.

15:44.061 --> 15:47.181
No, to make sure
you don't have a loch in kop.

15:48.649 --> 15:50.309
Hole in her head.

15:54.322 --> 15:56.065
Okay.

15:56.616 --> 15:57.695
I'll go.

15:57.867 --> 16:01.817
- Mark, your wife's on the phone.
- I'll take it in the lounge.

16:01.996 --> 16:07.750
- Please, find me if you hear anything.
- I will.

16:09.337 --> 16:12.540
- You think they're okay?
- She'll love them.

16:12.715 --> 16:16.796
You sure? I mean, they're 22 carat.

16:16.970 --> 16:21.014
- They're beautiful.
- They're not real rubies or anything.

16:21.182 --> 16:23.970
Yeah, but they're really, really lovely.

16:24.144 --> 16:28.011
- You still here?
- I'm leaving right now.

16:28.857 --> 16:33.068
- They're perfect for her.
- Red is her color.

16:34.154 --> 16:36.989
No, Jen. I'm not gonna let you
walk all over me on this one.

16:37.157 --> 16:41.534
You should've thought of it before you
started screwing your coworker.

16:41.703 --> 16:43.245
Jen had the nerve to suggest...

16:43.413 --> 16:46.367
...that Rachel stay with her in Dayton
for two more days.

16:46.541 --> 16:50.325
- What for?
- Some skating party with her cousins.

16:50.504 --> 16:53.173
Jen is really pushing it.
She's having an affair...

16:53.340 --> 16:55.665
...and I have to give up
my daughter at Christmas.

16:55.843 --> 16:58.879
She really has great timing.
Mid-December kamikaze strike.

16:59.054 --> 17:00.679
Maximize pain and suffering.

17:00.848 --> 17:04.013
And I know you don't wanna
take it out on Rachel.

17:05.685 --> 17:07.310
Of course not.

17:07.813 --> 17:10.731
I'm taking Susie over
to Cookie and Henry's tomorrow.

17:10.898 --> 17:15.193
It's a dreadful family fare,
and we'd love you to join us.

17:15.362 --> 17:16.738
Thanks, but...

17:16.906 --> 17:19.231
Randi has Mrs. Steiner's
son on the phone.

17:19.407 --> 17:21.898
- He's calling from Glen Ellyn.
- I'm on my way.

17:22.078 --> 17:23.536
Later.

17:23.704 --> 17:27.038
- Somebody hit fast forward?
- Carl, you're at warp speed.

17:27.208 --> 17:30.125
You should see
my mother darn a sock.

17:30.294 --> 17:32.999
- Time?
- You're at 55 minutes and 30 seconds.

17:33.172 --> 17:36.043
We're about to make a run
for beating the clock.

17:36.217 --> 17:38.790
Personal best still stands at 57.07.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.046
- Peter, you're a lucky man.
- Am I?

17:41.222 --> 17:44.093
Yep. You have a student
who talks to patients.

17:44.267 --> 17:48.596
- Must save you a lot of headaches.
- Sometimes.

17:48.938 --> 17:51.690
- How many of these have you assisted on?
- This is my fifth.

17:51.858 --> 17:55.902
- Really? Are you ready to finish this one?
- Yeah.

17:56.821 --> 18:01.068
And still have us break the record?
Don't say yes unless you can be sure.

18:01.242 --> 18:02.902
- I'm sure.
- All right.

18:03.077 --> 18:05.403
Carter, do the suctioning.
Simon, watch the clock.

18:05.580 --> 18:09.079
- Come on!
-56. 14 and counting.

18:09.250 --> 18:13.331
Now, go inside-out on the aorta,
outside-in on the graft. That's right.

18:13.505 --> 18:16.671
Long bites. Move along.
Pick up the pace.

18:16.841 --> 18:19.677
- Come on. Find your stroke.
-56.30.

18:19.845 --> 18:21.754
Don't twist the Gore-tex!

18:21.930 --> 18:24.503
- Pull up the slack!
- Fifty-seven on the nose.

18:24.683 --> 18:26.675
- Ready to tie off.
- Do it, Carter.

18:26.852 --> 18:29.521
- Cut it at three millimeters.
-57.06.

18:30.814 --> 18:32.557
- Did it.
- We have to check for leakage.

18:32.733 --> 18:35.484
- Release the distal Satinsky.
- Shoot.

18:36.361 --> 18:38.852
Proxima clamp.
Looks very good.

18:39.031 --> 18:40.774
- Time?
-57. 16.

18:40.949 --> 18:43.701
Isn't that too bad?
We didn't break the record.

18:43.869 --> 18:47.202
It would've been a nice way
to ring out the year.

18:49.541 --> 18:53.586
- Randi, Mrs. Steiner back from CT yet?
- On her way.

18:53.754 --> 18:55.332
Any news on her granddaughter?

18:55.506 --> 18:58.839
Must be 20 miles of highway between
here and where they found her car.

18:59.009 --> 19:01.880
- People are sick.
- The parents are on their way in.

19:02.054 --> 19:06.004
- In this weather, it'll take them a while.
- My poor roof!

19:08.394 --> 19:11.893
- Mlungisi.
- Kerry!

19:12.481 --> 19:14.059
Mlungisi.

19:20.239 --> 19:22.362
I came straight from the airport.

19:24.952 --> 19:26.826
If you'll have me.

19:31.709 --> 19:35.327
I was just about to go on a break.

19:38.216 --> 19:41.585
Everyone, this is Mlungisi.

19:41.761 --> 19:44.845
- Hi.
- My pleasure.

19:45.014 --> 19:48.514
- I'll be back in half an hour.
- Fine.

19:49.602 --> 19:52.058
Mark, Mrs. Steiner's back.

19:58.111 --> 20:01.397
- No?
- Not yet. They're still searching.

20:01.573 --> 20:04.278
My son and I could use some help here!

20:04.451 --> 20:07.617
- We need a doctor.
- Dr. Ross? Dr. Ross!

20:07.787 --> 20:11.370
- Here we go. Right this way.
- He took a bullet in the shoulder.

20:11.541 --> 20:13.368
- Can you walk on your own?
- Yeah.

20:13.543 --> 20:16.877
- Hang tough, kiddo.
- All right, it's close. It's Trauma 1!

20:18.173 --> 20:22.918
She's only been missing a short time.
Don't give up.

20:24.137 --> 20:26.973
I guess I don't have to tell you that.

20:30.102 --> 20:34.265
It's easier when you're young.
You know nothing else.

20:35.649 --> 20:39.398
They call you "dirty Jew" in school.

20:39.820 --> 20:44.149
- You've seen the worst of people.
- And the best.

20:47.161 --> 20:51.989
This little baby. She's so sweet.

20:52.333 --> 20:55.168
They just wanted the car.

20:55.461 --> 20:58.248
I don't think they would hurt her.

20:59.382 --> 21:00.959
But they would.

21:01.884 --> 21:05.069
You know, you go on...

21:05.070 --> 21:08.254
after you have seen evil.

21:08.432 --> 21:12.430
You laugh. You work.
You have children.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.856
You don't let it own you.

21:16.691 --> 21:19.182
That's your revenge.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.141
To live.

21:24.824 --> 21:26.532
And then...

21:27.660 --> 21:29.902
...something like this...

21:31.164 --> 21:36.870
And you know
that it can all be taken away.

21:37.712 --> 21:40.286
We still hope for the best.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.707
Yeah. Hope.

21:42.884 --> 21:48.223
You know what I was thinking
when I was upstairs in this machine?

21:48.473 --> 21:50.051
Lying so still...

21:50.225 --> 21:54.934
...I did something
that I stopped doing...

21:55.105 --> 21:57.430
...50 years ago.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.063
I prayed to God.

22:03.989 --> 22:09.328
- You know Yiddish, Dr. Greene?
- A little from my grandmother.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.282
But you are a religious man?

22:13.332 --> 22:17.164
I'm the son of an agnostic Jew
and a lapsed Catholic.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.336
You're no good at all.

22:20.506 --> 22:25.215
I can't ask you to pray for my family.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.592
Well, I can try.

22:48.659 --> 22:52.787
- Dreaming of a white Christmas?
- I'm hoping the tarp stays tied on my roof.

22:52.955 --> 22:56.122
I hope the party's not history.
The Drive's already at a standstill.

22:56.292 --> 23:01.369
All the more reason to celebrate, right?
So I was thinking, 4:00 up in Recovery.

23:01.547 --> 23:05.379
You've heard me sing. Poor Susie hears
the first line of Rock-a-Bye Baby...

23:05.551 --> 23:07.793
...and goes to sleep
as a defense mechanism.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.797
Just mouth the words.
That's what I do.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.464
- While who sings?
- I'm working on that. Carter.

23:12.642 --> 23:15.809
No, no, no. Chronic tone-deafness
and acute stage fright.

23:15.979 --> 23:19.727
- Do you have the time now?
- Yeah, find me in Radiology.

23:21.359 --> 23:24.111
Carol, Mr. Calus is ready
for sterile dressing.

23:24.279 --> 23:28.146
- Mark. Who's in there with him?
- It's his family.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.780
Doesn't he remind you of somebody?

23:30.952 --> 23:33.739
What, you kidding?
He's the spitting image.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.867
- I know it's ridiculous...
- No, he looks just like him.

23:37.042 --> 23:39.711
- When he was old, right before he died.
- Before who died?

23:39.878 --> 23:42.795
Jerry Garcia. That's who
we're talking about, isn't it?

23:50.514 --> 23:53.764
- Oh, Carter, she'll love them.
- You think?

23:53.934 --> 23:55.048
They look just like her.

23:55.227 --> 23:57.433
- They're not too much?
- No, they're fun.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.558
- I haven't been seeing Harper that long.
- They're great.

24:00.732 --> 24:05.026
I saw them and I just thought...
You're sure they're not too much?

24:08.365 --> 24:10.690
Are you telling me these...

24:11.994 --> 24:13.903
- Are these real?
- They're too much.

24:14.079 --> 24:17.448
No! No, I mean, they're beautiful.
She'll love them.

24:17.625 --> 24:20.116
- No, I went overboard.
- No, of course not.

24:20.294 --> 24:22.536
You thought of her.
She'll be touched.

24:24.048 --> 24:25.791
Susan, we need a doctor out here.

24:26.258 --> 24:29.462
- Somebody help. Our priest has been shot.
- Put him here.

24:29.637 --> 24:32.887
You all right, B-Pop? You'll be all right.
You're at the hospital now.

24:33.057 --> 24:36.260
- What happened?
- We found him at the church.

24:36.435 --> 24:38.143
LG shot him up like a dog.

24:38.312 --> 24:41.230
- How much blood did he lose?
- A lot. 911 didn't even show up.

24:41.399 --> 24:44.981
- We drove him in here ourselves.
- We'll take care of him now.

24:45.152 --> 24:49.020
- Jeanie, you're on.
- You're gonna be okay, man.

24:49.740 --> 24:51.400
- They shot a priest?
- Yeah.

24:51.576 --> 24:53.403
I am out of here.

24:53.578 --> 24:56.247
Bet I beat you out the door.
See you all at the party.

24:56.414 --> 24:57.825
Careful on the roads.

24:57.999 --> 25:01.699
I hope it's not too late to withdraw
my offer to work the holidays.

25:01.878 --> 25:04.250
No. Looks like you have a visitor.

25:04.422 --> 25:07.340
Yeah, I think I may skip the party.

25:07.509 --> 25:10.178
I'll be right there, Mlungisi.

25:11.554 --> 25:13.926
Kerry, didn't expect him?

25:14.099 --> 25:16.471
- Complete surprise.
- I love surprises.

25:16.643 --> 25:18.303
Mlungisi's full of them.

25:18.478 --> 25:22.262
- So how do you know him?
- I...

25:25.151 --> 25:29.232
I had a farm in Africa...

25:30.532 --> 25:31.907
Sinus tach.

25:32.075 --> 25:34.234
Good bilateral breath sounds,
no tracheal shift.

25:34.411 --> 25:37.198
- Doctor, please...
- Father, please try to relax.

25:37.372 --> 25:38.701
- Pulse ox?
- Ninety-six.

25:38.874 --> 25:43.168
- Good, he's not hypoxic. Where's X-ray?
- On their way. Here you go.

25:43.337 --> 25:46.041
I have to speak to the boy outside.

25:46.214 --> 25:47.839
- Father, not now.
- Please!

25:48.175 --> 25:50.844
I need to talk to him before I die.

25:51.011 --> 25:53.419
- You're not going to die.
- Please!

25:53.597 --> 25:55.969
- I'm going to find that kid.
- Okay.

25:58.227 --> 26:02.853
A squad car's coming with an infant
that might be Hanna Steiner's grandchild.

26:03.023 --> 26:04.648
- Do you need warming blankets?
- No.

26:04.817 --> 26:07.224
They found her
in this triple-X theater on Ashland.

26:07.403 --> 26:10.357
They don't know her condition,
but she's screaming her head off.

26:10.531 --> 26:12.239
It's a good sign.

26:18.122 --> 26:21.372
- All right, I've got her.
- Lungs are working.

26:27.214 --> 26:30.548
- Tell the grandmother.
- Let's check her condition first.

26:30.718 --> 26:33.291
- Take her to T-1.
- Get the warmer.

26:33.471 --> 26:35.380
It's already done.

26:44.232 --> 26:47.932
- No signs of trauma.
- Good one. Here.

26:55.034 --> 26:57.360
She's alert and interactive.
Good eye contact.

26:57.537 --> 27:01.202
Good breath sounds.
Let's get a core temperature.

27:02.125 --> 27:06.289
- No apparent injury.
- Mad as hell!

27:08.506 --> 27:10.380
- Tirzah!
- Ms. Steiner.

27:10.550 --> 27:13.753
Tirzah! I knew it was you.

27:13.929 --> 27:16.846
Please. Come, darling.

27:17.015 --> 27:19.802
All right. Go ahead.

27:19.976 --> 27:25.766
My darling. Oh, sweetheart.
Bless you. Oh, sweetheart.

27:27.818 --> 27:30.487
She's hungry, that is all.

27:31.446 --> 27:36.441
- I don't believe you, B-Pop.
- Listen to me.

27:37.286 --> 27:40.156
- Shooting.
- We have to step away.

27:44.626 --> 27:47.414
- Get the shoulder vest.
- You're trying to protect the LGs.

27:47.588 --> 27:50.838
I know you are.
I know they did this to you, B-Pop.

27:51.008 --> 27:54.756
I saw him. I saw him.
He wasn't from the 'hood.

27:54.929 --> 27:57.716
You're trying to keep the truce.
I know it, man.

27:57.890 --> 28:00.807
- Father, you need to stop talking.
- No.

28:07.817 --> 28:10.936
Diablito, it wasn't an LG.

28:13.364 --> 28:14.823
I swear to God.

28:15.992 --> 28:17.818
You need to go now. Malik.

28:17.994 --> 28:20.485
- Let's go. Come on.
- No, man. No!

28:22.081 --> 28:23.825
Let's go.

28:24.584 --> 28:28.249
For him. For Diablo.

28:30.339 --> 28:32.297
I need a wet read on this.
Top priority.

28:32.467 --> 28:35.171
- Give them to me.
- Thanks.

28:37.513 --> 28:40.005
Sorry I left you with
all the last-minute deliveries.

28:40.183 --> 28:44.228
- No problem. I like to drive.
- You call that driving or flying?

28:44.395 --> 28:47.017
It's nice that you're all willing
to help out your dad.

28:47.190 --> 28:49.183
The whole brood'll
be charging me overtime.

28:49.359 --> 28:51.850
See you back at the homestead.
Got your maps?

28:52.028 --> 28:54.104
The naughty and the nice.

28:54.572 --> 28:58.784
Okay, Mr. Calus, I will be right back
with your tetanus shot.

29:01.413 --> 29:05.363
I'd just like to say how much
I've enjoyed taking care of you.

29:05.667 --> 29:07.327
Well, that's awfully nice to hear.

29:07.502 --> 29:09.661
I've been surrounded
by bah-humbuggers all day.

29:09.838 --> 29:12.673
No one's in the spirit.
They won't even sing a few carols.

29:12.841 --> 29:15.166
But you have been the exception.

29:15.635 --> 29:20.132
You can't count on other people to
give it to you. Know what I mean?

29:20.307 --> 29:23.557
The spirit. It's in you.

29:24.728 --> 29:26.056
You're right.

29:29.358 --> 29:32.643
You are absolutely right. Thank you.

29:38.575 --> 29:42.490
I'm going to sing some carols.
Anybody care to join me?

29:49.753 --> 29:52.920
It's 4:00.
I'm going up to Recovery.

29:59.180 --> 30:01.007
Last chance to spread some holiday cheer.

30:01.182 --> 30:02.593
What?

30:12.693 --> 30:15.860
And God bless us, everyone.

30:19.867 --> 30:21.611
- Pressure's falling.
- Get him up.

30:21.786 --> 30:25.784
- What about X-ray?
- Can't wait. The Father cannot wait.

30:25.957 --> 30:27.368
Watch it.

30:27.917 --> 30:29.661
Coming through.

30:31.546 --> 30:34.962
- Move, move. Watch it!
- Look out!

30:35.133 --> 30:37.920
Get out of the way. Come on.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.429
Hey, what's going on?

30:40.597 --> 30:44.381
- Damn, he's bradying down.
- We're losing his pulse. Get him back!

30:44.559 --> 30:45.804
What's going on?

30:45.977 --> 30:48.303
- Bag him. I'll start compressions.
- I got you.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.722
- Is he okay?
- Back to Trauma.

30:52.943 --> 30:54.567
Where are you taking him?

30:54.736 --> 30:57.737
- No room at the inn.
- Pulse is gone.

30:57.906 --> 31:00.741
Damn it.
He's bleeding out. Curtain 2.

31:00.909 --> 31:04.408
- Mark, 2.
- Out of the way!

31:05.664 --> 31:11.038
Run the IVs wide open. Rapid infuser.
Thoracotomy tray. Scalpel.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.831
Rib spreader.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.294
What's going on? What's wrong?

31:16.467 --> 31:20.416
Suction.
Malik, hold the retractor. Suction!

31:20.763 --> 31:22.340
Come on!

31:23.390 --> 31:26.724
Oh, damn it. Cross clamp him. Now!

31:26.894 --> 31:28.851
Satinsky!

31:30.105 --> 31:32.513
Bullet severed the aorta.

31:32.691 --> 31:35.443
Start internal compressions.

31:36.862 --> 31:39.532
Come on. Hurry up in there!

31:44.704 --> 31:46.945
Damn... Thank you!

31:50.960 --> 31:52.953
Hey, watch out.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.887
- Where's the priest?
- Curtain 2.

32:04.057 --> 32:06.298
Widened mediastinum.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.434
Time of death: 4:17.

32:10.605 --> 32:12.514
Oh, man...

32:13.233 --> 32:16.399
Oh, man. No. Oh, man.

32:16.569 --> 32:19.772
Come on, do something!
Do something else.

32:19.948 --> 32:22.106
Do something, man.

32:22.283 --> 32:24.525
It won't help. I'm sorry.

32:26.746 --> 32:29.581
B- Pop. Oh, man...

32:29.749 --> 32:34.292
Get him a priest.
You guys can do that, right?

32:34.462 --> 32:39.171
Lydia, can you run upstairs
and try to find a chaplain.

32:39.342 --> 32:40.885
He'd want a priest.

33:56.337 --> 33:59.789
And suddenly there was with the angel
a multitude of the heavenly host...

33:59.966 --> 34:03.465
...praising God, and saying,
"Glory to the God in the highest...

34:03.636 --> 34:08.014
...and on earth,
peace and goodwill toward men. "

34:08.183 --> 34:11.018
LOL with sudden back pain.
She's diaphoretic, short of breath.

34:11.186 --> 34:14.270
- What's her history?
- Hypertension. She's 220/140 right now.

34:14.438 --> 34:16.847
Call Mark.
Get Carter down here now!

34:17.025 --> 34:18.518
Aye, sir.

34:19.860 --> 34:22.981
My back! It's ripping apart!

34:23.156 --> 34:24.353
Help her.

34:24.533 --> 34:27.818
- When did the pain start?
-20 minutes ago. We were shopping.

34:27.994 --> 34:29.987
- Loss of pulses.
- Aortic regurge.

34:30.163 --> 34:34.871
Let's get a chest film, an angiogram.
Propranolol, one milligram IV bolus.

34:35.043 --> 34:38.377
- Set up an art line.
- Is it a heart attack?

34:39.339 --> 34:42.043
No, sir.
Your wife's EKG is normal.

34:42.217 --> 34:45.004
I'm ordering tests to see
if she has a dissecting aneurysm.

34:45.178 --> 34:46.554
Pressure's coming down.

34:46.722 --> 34:49.723
Start sodium nitroprusside,
50 mcg per minute.

34:49.891 --> 34:53.426
Titrate to a diastolic of 100.
Alert the O.R.

34:53.853 --> 34:56.938
- What have we got?
- Acute aortic dissection.

34:57.107 --> 34:58.518
- Should I call the O.R.?
- Done.

34:58.692 --> 35:01.397
- I need you to talk to Mr...
- Rubadoux.

35:01.570 --> 35:04.820
Explain the procedure and get her
consented for the clamp-and-run.

35:04.990 --> 35:06.401
Okay.

35:06.575 --> 35:09.197
- Does my wife need an operation?
- She might, sir.

35:09.370 --> 35:12.406
If you come with me,
I'll be happy to explain it to you.

35:13.165 --> 35:14.790
I gotta go. I'll be back soon.

35:15.376 --> 35:17.582
- I'll be right back.
- It's okay.

35:17.878 --> 35:19.456
This way.

35:22.675 --> 35:27.384
- Were we as bad as we thought we'd be?
- It was worse. It was great.

35:27.930 --> 35:30.765
Mr. Calus, I'm so sorry...

35:32.602 --> 35:37.062
- Mark, have you seen Mr. Calus?
- Yeah, he was just in there.

35:51.913 --> 35:54.451
This shows
what Dr. Benton feared is true.

35:54.624 --> 36:00.378
Your wife has a dissecting aneurysm.
The wall of the aorta is tearing.

36:00.797 --> 36:03.549
With your wife's age
and her history of hypertension-

36:03.717 --> 36:05.709
But she's very active.

36:05.885 --> 36:07.759
Still. Surgery is a risk.

36:07.929 --> 36:10.385
- What are the odds?
- About fifty-fifty.

36:10.557 --> 36:14.768
But if your wife's aorta continues ripping,
then she has no odds at all.

36:14.936 --> 36:19.148
Well, it sounds like we have
no choice here. Okay, I'll sign.

36:19.316 --> 36:22.815
You have a choice
of a new surgical technique.

36:22.986 --> 36:24.480
The clamp-and-run procedure.

36:24.654 --> 36:28.948
This has the benefit of taking a fraction
of the time the standard surgery takes.

36:29.117 --> 36:31.075
Why is that better?

36:31.995 --> 36:36.953
You always run a risk of heart attack
or paralysis with this operation.

36:37.125 --> 36:38.501
It's new.

36:38.669 --> 36:43.331
Developed by one of the top vascular
surgeons in the country. He works here.

36:44.341 --> 36:46.583
Newer's better?

36:48.429 --> 36:50.920
I don't know. I don't know.

36:51.974 --> 36:53.717
It's up to you.

36:55.144 --> 36:56.472
But...

36:58.063 --> 37:00.899
You'd go with the new thing?

37:02.735 --> 37:04.146
I would.

37:04.570 --> 37:08.438
You would. Okay.
All right, where do I sign?

37:12.536 --> 37:15.324
See if the church wants to stop by
to pick these up.

37:15.498 --> 37:18.119
Don't you wanna hand them over
to the parishioners?

37:20.962 --> 37:24.627
All right, he's dead.
They did it, man.

37:24.799 --> 37:27.420
That guy's gonna pay.

37:29.429 --> 37:34.387
- He said it wasn't them.
- He was just trying to keep the truce.

37:34.559 --> 37:38.058
- I know those cabrones killed him.
- He said they didn't.

37:38.229 --> 37:41.396
Did he ever lie to you? Did he?

37:42.400 --> 37:48.385
Man, B-Pop? See, he thought one man
could change things. He was wrong.

37:48.656 --> 37:53.200
So you shoot them and they shoot you,
and that's what the Father died for?

37:54.704 --> 37:58.287
You're right, Diablo.
One man couldn't do it.

38:02.504 --> 38:03.998
Help him now.

38:10.554 --> 38:14.338
Doctor, please. Will you tell them
to go on? They won't listen to me.

38:14.516 --> 38:17.434
Your mother does have to stay
for observation.

38:17.603 --> 38:21.683
- That's why we're staying too.
- You'll spoil the children's Hanukkah.

38:21.857 --> 38:24.229
We brought Hanukkah here.
Is that all right?

38:24.401 --> 38:27.153
- We brought a menorah...
- A menorah?

38:27.321 --> 38:30.238
Okay, okay.
I think I can find a place.

38:30.407 --> 38:34.072
James! I haven't seen you
in a long time. How are you?

38:34.244 --> 38:36.914
- She's definitely a candidate.
- She's obviously high risk.

38:37.081 --> 38:39.750
- Has she consented?
- She's being prepped right now.

38:39.917 --> 38:42.075
Unfortunately, I've had one of these.

38:42.253 --> 38:46.582
Simon will assist, and you will have a
chance at breaking the record, Peter.

38:47.716 --> 38:49.590
- I'm ready.
- We'll see.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.717
Shall we, gentlemen?

38:51.887 --> 38:54.129
- Oh, man.
- I am so disappointed.

38:54.306 --> 38:57.722
- What's wrong?
- We canceled. Area's snowed in.

38:57.893 --> 39:00.100
- No Christmas party?
- The roads are bad.

39:00.271 --> 39:01.599
Will they still bill us?

39:01.772 --> 39:04.773
I wish my house was ready.
I'm only a few "L" stops away.

39:04.942 --> 39:08.607
- What's not ready?
- No furniture, no walls and no roof.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.322
I got the fireplace working.

39:10.490 --> 39:12.363
- You did?
- I was gonna surprise you.

39:12.533 --> 39:14.325
Perfect. What should we bring?

39:14.494 --> 39:17.993
- Mark, party at Carol's.
- I'll try and make it later.

39:18.164 --> 39:20.287
Hang on, I'll go get little Susie.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.451
- What's your address?
- Call the others.

39:22.627 --> 39:25.711
- I guess it's BYO everything.
- We'll stop at the market.

39:25.880 --> 39:28.751
- I'll see you there.
- Party at Hathaway's!

40:04.503 --> 40:08.335
- And now what do we play, Sammy?
- Dreidel!

40:08.507 --> 40:12.374
- And what do those letters mean?
- "A miracle happened there. "

40:12.553 --> 40:16.337
Yeah. Today we had our own miracle.

40:16.515 --> 40:20.844
Tirzah came back to us,
safe and sound.

40:21.020 --> 40:24.685
And, also, Dr. Greene
and I said our prayers...

40:24.857 --> 40:27.727
...and that's a miracle too.

40:30.613 --> 40:36.200
I thought that God and I
had forsaken each other.

40:36.744 --> 40:42.035
And then I found out
that he was always with me.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.993
In each of you.

40:46.545 --> 40:47.708
Bless you.

40:50.550 --> 40:55.377
- And now, who goes first?
- Me!

40:56.514 --> 40:59.005
Oh, my little girl.

40:59.726 --> 41:01.350
What did you get?

41:13.239 --> 41:17.023
Do you see that?
Don't you ever dance like that.

41:20.413 --> 41:22.073
It's the champion!

41:22.248 --> 41:26.412
Everyone, he broke the 1995 record
for the clamp-and-run procedure...

41:26.586 --> 41:28.709
- ... and saved a life.
- Carter...

41:30.048 --> 41:33.215
- Where can I put this?
- In the back room.

41:33.385 --> 41:35.093
What a hero.

41:35.262 --> 41:38.880
- They're outrageous.
- I like yours.

41:39.057 --> 41:43.933
- Think they'd notice if we switched?
- No! I mean, I think they would.

41:44.104 --> 41:46.262
Look who's drunk.

41:48.608 --> 41:53.105
- You're leaving?
- No, I just needed my coat.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.779
Yeah, it's chilly in here.

41:59.995 --> 42:02.451
I thought about you today, Peter.

42:02.623 --> 42:06.952
Your first Christmas without your mother.
I hope it's not too hard.

42:09.630 --> 42:14.755
She had her favorite Bible verse in Luke.
Had me memorize it before I could read.

42:14.927 --> 42:17.465
On Christmas, she liked to hear it.

42:18.889 --> 42:22.056
Keeping watch
over their flocks by night.

42:24.603 --> 42:27.640
Yeah. That's the one.

42:34.071 --> 42:35.400
So, I...

42:36.699 --> 42:39.700
I guess it's your
first Christmas alone too, huh?

42:49.128 --> 42:50.409
Well...

42:52.882 --> 42:54.507
Have a good one.

42:57.553 --> 42:58.882
You too.

43:05.979 --> 43:08.684
Wait for the toast, now.

43:08.857 --> 43:11.608
I know I've got more cups up here.

43:12.944 --> 43:14.853
Hey, will this do?

43:18.533 --> 43:19.696
What?

43:25.373 --> 43:26.916
I love you.

43:34.424 --> 43:37.094
I do. I said it. I do.

43:37.260 --> 43:39.586
- I want you to have my babies.
- Shep-

43:39.763 --> 43:42.930
I mean, I think that we would
have really good ones.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.677
I think they would look nice.

43:44.852 --> 43:49.229
I think that we should spend
every Christmas together. Forever.

43:49.398 --> 43:51.889
Don't think about it, just say yes.

43:52.067 --> 43:53.894
- Shep, stop.
- I know it's sudden.

43:54.069 --> 43:58.399
I know it's out of the blue,
but I said it and I don't take it back.

43:58.574 --> 44:02.903
I think this... You...
This is the best.

44:03.078 --> 44:06.661
And you don't have
to say anything back. Okay?

44:09.460 --> 44:13.208
Just stay just the way you are.

44:15.257 --> 44:16.965
- Don't move.
- Found any more-

44:21.264 --> 44:23.505
Say the first part again.

44:24.016 --> 44:26.305
The "I love you"?

44:36.487 --> 44:37.982
No, honey. Mommy's right.

44:38.156 --> 44:41.489
If you hang your stocking at Grandpa's,
Santa will find it.

44:41.659 --> 44:44.613
So I hear your cousins
are having a skating party.

44:44.787 --> 44:46.780
You wanna stay for that?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.289
Okay. Then I'll see you
in a couple of days...

44:51.461 --> 44:56.621
...and you and I are gonna celebrate our
biggest, most special day of the year.

44:56.800 --> 45:00.003
That's the first annual
Rachel and Dad...

45:00.178 --> 45:04.970
...post-Christmas, post-Hanukkah,
pre-New Year's Day celebration.

45:06.059 --> 45:09.973
Well, that's the good part.
You and I are gonna make it up.
