00:00.010 --> 00:02.280
Previously on Broadchurch:

00:02.760 --> 00:05.160
There were two girls. Cousins.

00:05.480 --> 00:10.150
Lisa Newbury, 19, was babysitting
for her 12-year-old cousin Pippa.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.830
Pippa's parents went away for
the night to a friend's wedding.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.190
They came back the next day
and both girls were gone.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.830
Our main suspect was a
man called Lee Ashworth.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.710
Lee's my husband. I think he's
back and looking for me.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.440
~ You've been hiding her here?
~ It's sort of witness protection.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.430
Joseph Michael Miller,
how do you plead?

00:28.480 --> 00:31.110
~ Not guilty.
~ No!
~ He can't.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.870
~ You know that I'm defending Joe Miller.
~ I'll be prosecuting.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.150
Joe's legal team have requested
a new autopsy on Danny's body.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.590
I hope you rot in hell! For
what you've done to us.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.640
Why are you so sure
he killed those girls?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

00:55.240 --> 01:00.630
At fixed intervals during the probationary
period you'll have a review.

01:00.680 --> 01:04.360
Conducted by the Learning
Development Officer.

01:05.600 --> 01:10.030
This will establish whether or not
you have met the required standards

01:10.080 --> 01:13.880
to be an efficient and
effective police officer.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.830
Why the hell did you say yes to
this job if you don't enjoy it?

01:20.880 --> 01:24.070
~ Not that bad, am I?
~ You'll demotivate our entire intake.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.110
The boredom drips off you.

01:26.160 --> 01:29.270
~ I was good at my job.
~ Yeah, and you're no longer fit for it.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.360
So get good at this one
or do something else.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.840
Over-achievers have an
inherent fear of failure.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.390
"You have one new message."

02:20.440 --> 02:22.430
"Claire, it's me.

02:22.480 --> 02:25.580
You should answer. I
wanna hear your voice.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.750
Look, I want you to know...

02:28.800 --> 02:31.800
I love you. I've been thinking
about you all this time.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.790
Listen, I know it hasn't been easy.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.830
But I'm close now.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.880
I'll see you soon."

02:56.040 --> 03:00.950
~ Hi.
~ Alec, Lee just called and left me
a message. How did he get my number?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.710
OK. What did he say?

03:03.760 --> 03:05.760
He said he's close.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.630
Claire, I promise you're
safe. Just stay there.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.480
~ I've gotta go.
~ Alec, please don't go.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.630
What do you want?

03:27.680 --> 03:29.670
Where's Claire?

03:29.720 --> 03:31.720
Why would I know?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.870
Don't mess me about.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.790
~ I wanna see her.
~ Lisa Newbury's parents
wanna see their daughter.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.590
For the last time... I had
nothing to do with that.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.640
I don't believe you.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.270
You got it wrong.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.310
It's over.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.350
Not for the parents.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.400
Not for me.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.120
What about for me?

03:58.720 --> 04:01.520
I lost my whole life cos of you.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.870
~ I had to leave the country.
~ So why'd you come back?

04:04.920 --> 04:06.920
I want my life back.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.150
Now tell me where I find Claire.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.350
Or do I have to follow
you around everywhere?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.390
Yeah, give it a go.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.440
Here's my number.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.940
You tell her to call me.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.300
Sorry about your health.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.120
What did you say?

04:29.120 --> 04:31.390
Someone said you were sick.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.110
Over a little further.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.390
Careful with those. They
go upstairs in my office.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.980
And don't scratch the paintwork.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.040
~ See ya.
~ Bye.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.790
I hope shitface has got a good
reason for not reporting this.

05:48.840 --> 05:52.000
~ Not that I'm finding much.
~ I appreciate the favour anyway.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.510
When are you gonna come
back to work here, then?

05:55.560 --> 05:58.070
~ Not gonna happen.
~ Not as good as Devon, is it?

05:58.120 --> 06:00.120
No.

06:03.240 --> 06:07.030
Erm, I wondered if you still
wanted to go for that drink.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.670
~ Oh. Right.
~ Or not.

06:09.720 --> 06:13.030
No. It's just that...
I'm seeing someone now.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.420
Course you are. Quite right.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.880
Better finish up.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.430
~ What the hell are you doing?
~ Nothing.
~ Put it away! God's sake!

06:49.480 --> 06:52.550
~ Don't have a go at me.
~ How dare you! I ask one wee favour.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.630
~ Why have you got that?
~ None of your business.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.000
You've made it my business.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.230
What?

07:01.280 --> 07:04.150
Yeah. Actually I'm
with her right now.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.270
The second autopsy provided
no new information

07:11.320 --> 07:14.830
or suggestion that the first
autopsy had overlooked anything.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.870
They dug him up for nothing.

07:16.920 --> 07:20.420
Just so that Joe Miller
could have a bit of fun.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.160
I was thinking...

07:26.280 --> 07:28.590
~ .. we should have a date.
~ What do you mean?

07:28.640 --> 07:30.640
Go out, you and me.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.720
You know, last chance
till the baby comes.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.950
We could go to the pictures.
Take our mind off the trial.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.190
Why do you wanna go
to the pictures for?

07:40.240 --> 07:42.510
We got a big telly to
watch things at home.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.670
~ Dinner, then. A meal out.
~ How much will that set us back?

07:45.720 --> 07:47.990
Stop going on about
money. Bloody hell.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.510
We've got a new baby
coming. That's one wage.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.350
Half me old customers aren't calling
'cause they don't know what to say about Dan.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.390
One night.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.830
Before it's nappies
and night feeds again.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.790
~ We don't see each other.
~ We see each other every day.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.950
We don't talk about important things.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.100
Let's do this tonight,
all right? I'm late.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.790
Did she say what she wanted?
What do you think it is?

08:20.840 --> 08:22.950
I don't know. Stop wittering, Miller.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.540
Ashworth came to see me earlier.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.760
Said he's looking for Claire and he's
not gonna stop till he finds her.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.120
Well, you said that's what
you wanted. Now you've got it.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.190
~ Alec Hardy.
~ I know.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.230
Ellie. Ellie Miller.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.280
Come in.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.990
Wow. Look at that view.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.030
I've always envied this house.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.070
How long have you been here?

08:50.120 --> 08:52.120
Please have a seat.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.750
Do both of you understand how a prosecution
case is built in court?

08:59.800 --> 09:03.950
It's my responsibility to prove
your husband's guilt beyond doubt.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.110
And I do this by building
a wall of evidence,

09:07.160 --> 09:09.710
in front of the jury, brick by brick.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.470
Each piece of evidence
is a new brick.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.910
When it's built, the
wall is unassailable.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.830
~ Right.
~ Some bricks are more important than others.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.870
Cornerstones, for example.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.910
A confession by the accused.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.950
Absolutely crucial.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.480
What did you call us here for?

09:35.720 --> 09:40.630
You assaulted Joe Miller in the interview
room at Broadchurch police station.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.190
While you stood and watched.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.230
Oh, God.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.840
I have seen the tape. What
the hell were you doing?

09:51.080 --> 09:53.750
I was upset. I didn't believe
what was happening

09:53.800 --> 09:55.790
and I asked to see my husband.

09:55.840 --> 10:00.070
Police brutality? Extracting
a confession through violence?

10:00.120 --> 10:02.870
It had been a very intense day.

10:02.920 --> 10:07.920
It was an error of judgement but I
had her removed as fast as I could.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.870
How am I supposed to
deal with this in court?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.910
Hm?

10:12.960 --> 10:16.190
Do you realise how the
defence will use this?

10:16.240 --> 10:20.470
~ Yeah, I do.
~ But how can you not have
realised this was coming?

10:20.520 --> 10:23.110
Well, he confessed. He
was gonna plead guilty.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.430
And you giving him a kicking
gave him an opportunity not to.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.950
If they don't get it
excluded straight away,

10:29.000 --> 10:33.590
which is a definite possibility, you
have to go on the stand and defend it.

10:33.640 --> 10:38.110
So you better start thinking how you're
going to justify what happened that day.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.670
Because we need this evidence in.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.990
We can't afford to
lose this confession.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.630
His confession happened
before I even saw him.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.750
Won't make a blind bit of difference.

10:47.800 --> 10:51.390
All the defence need to do is connect
the two events by suggestion.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.550
You have jeopardised my
best chance of success

10:54.600 --> 10:56.800
before we even got going.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.200
Why didn't you stop me that day?

11:05.220 --> 11:07.890
~ Oh, it's my fault now?
~ Why did you let me see him?

11:07.940 --> 11:09.930
I felt sorry for you.

11:09.980 --> 11:12.450
I didn't expect you to
go all Bruce Lee on him.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.490
Everyone will find out now.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.450
Shit. Tom will hear about it.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.650
His mum beating up his
dad in a police station.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.770
Oh, God. What do I do?

11:22.180 --> 11:24.690
I just wanna run away or
hide of emigrate or...

11:24.740 --> 11:26.740
Oh, God.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.570
What have you eaten today?

11:32.620 --> 11:34.760
KitKat and a Scotch egg.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.570
It's not too late
to change your plea.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.300
I can't do that.

11:43.660 --> 11:46.200
You can stop a lot of suffering.

11:48.460 --> 11:50.460
Mark and Beth...

11:51.660 --> 11:54.250
.. they don't need to be
put through this trial.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.290
Have you seen Fred?

11:56.340 --> 11:58.850
I thought maybe you could
get a picture of him.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.370
Bring it in for me. He
must have grown so much.

12:01.420 --> 12:04.330
~ I don't think that's appropriate.
~ Well, Tom, then.

12:04.380 --> 12:09.450
If you see him, tell him I think
of him every day. First thing.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.490
Tell him I love him.

12:11.540 --> 12:13.530
And that I'll be coming home soon.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.570
I'm not gonna do that, Joe.

12:15.620 --> 12:19.290
I thought you wanted to help me.
Why have you come here otherwise?

12:19.340 --> 12:21.480
Whose side you on, Paul?

12:46.500 --> 12:50.410
~ Hi, Beth.
~ Oh, hi. Where are you at the moment?

12:50.460 --> 12:54.300
Oh, just, uh... out.

12:55.060 --> 12:59.050
Oh, OK. I've come to put flowers
on Mum and Danny's graves

12:59.100 --> 13:02.290
~ and I fancied a chat.
~ Ah, I'm sorry.

13:02.340 --> 13:04.330
I'm a way aways.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.730
Tricky parishioner.

13:06.780 --> 13:09.370
OK. Can we find time soon?
I'd love to talk to you.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.410
Yeah. Definitely.

13:11.460 --> 13:13.810
Why don't I, uh, give you a call

13:13.860 --> 13:15.530
when I've got my diary
in front of me?

13:15.580 --> 13:17.250
~ OK. Bye.
~ Bye.

13:25.140 --> 13:27.250
Second autopsy turned up nothing new.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.690
Oh, well. It was a worth a go.
Might have rattled Jocelyn a bit.

13:30.740 --> 13:34.610
I've been through the statements from
the CID team. Nothing new there.

13:34.660 --> 13:36.930
But I did track down
the station cleaner.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.690
Now, she likes a chat. Very
good on office gossip.

13:39.740 --> 13:41.730
~ Anyone else spoken to her?
~ No.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.770
Nice. Well done.

13:43.820 --> 13:45.810
You're very welcome.

13:45.860 --> 13:48.250
What do you want to do about the confession?
See if there are grounds to have it excluded.

13:48.300 --> 13:50.290
I don't know. We'll see.

13:50.340 --> 13:53.250
What shall we do for dinner?
Is there anywhere good?

13:53.300 --> 13:57.090
I think it's a risk. Even with the
treatment of Joe Miller in custody.

13:57.140 --> 14:01.330
I think there's a Thai. They're usually
reliable, even in a place like this.

14:01.380 --> 14:04.050
Don't change the subject.
What's our game plan?

14:04.100 --> 14:07.970
~ I need to know what our strategy is.
~ We put the prosecution to proof.

14:08.020 --> 14:11.450
Jocelyn will try and build a wall of
evidence and we smash holes in it.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.490
After that, I'll take a view.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.410
No point making plans till
we know what they've got.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.850
Do we try and exclude
Miller's confession?

14:18.900 --> 14:20.890
Stop nagging. I'm still thinking.

14:20.940 --> 14:23.930
~ Is this really the only place to stay?
~ Yeah, afraid so.

14:23.980 --> 14:26.370
~ Did you have any hot water this morning?
~ No.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.410
~ Hi.
~ Hi. How's the stay?

14:28.460 --> 14:30.450
~ Brilliant.
~ Love it.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.010
~ Anything you need, just let me know.
~ Will do.
~ Thanks very much.

14:34.060 --> 14:36.130
Fat lot of use you are.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.730
Claire needs to meet Ashworth.

14:43.780 --> 14:45.770
I wanna put them together.

14:45.820 --> 14:47.810
And you don't see that as a risk?

14:47.860 --> 14:51.370
No. No, it's not a risk,
it's an opportunity.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.570
~ It's only gonna come once.
~ Do it officially.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.890
~ Talk to Jenkinson or one of your old bosses.
~ Nobody cares, Miller.

14:56.940 --> 15:00.440
The case is tainted. Nobody
wants to get near it.

15:01.220 --> 15:03.810
That's my failing. I've
got to put it right.

15:03.860 --> 15:05.850
What if he didn't do it?

15:05.900 --> 15:07.890
What if you're wrong?

15:07.940 --> 15:10.340
Just help me convince Claire.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.930
You risked everything for
me and I let you down.

15:17.980 --> 15:21.450
~ Yes.
~ But there are two families
back in Sandbrook.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.810
The Gillespies still don't know
who killed their daughter.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.850
~ The Newburys don't even have a body.
~ Why is this on me?

15:27.900 --> 15:30.170
~ Cos he trusts you.
~ Don't make me see him.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.300
~ We'll protect you.
~ No, I can't go back into that place.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.010
Come on, get your coat.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.050
~ What for?
~ Miller?

15:38.100 --> 15:41.400
Ignore him. We're gonna
get some air. Come on.

15:47.660 --> 15:50.050
These are the best chips
I've had in my life.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.090
I'll let you into a secret.

15:52.140 --> 15:55.180
I had salad earlier. I hate salad.

16:01.620 --> 16:05.490
How have you not gone crackers up in
that cottage? No work, no friends?

16:05.540 --> 16:07.530
I know.

16:07.580 --> 16:10.850
I used to be a hairdresser before
all this. Talking all day.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.890
Will you do mine one time?

16:12.940 --> 16:14.940
If you like.

16:16.980 --> 16:19.490
Is that how you met your husband?

16:19.540 --> 16:21.530
More or less.

16:21.580 --> 16:25.490
Client of mine was having a barbecue,
I was new to the area, he was there.

16:25.540 --> 16:27.530
Fancied him soon as I saw him.

16:27.580 --> 16:30.120
It was like a chemical reaction.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.290
Three hours later I was
shagging him on his floor.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.970
You weren't. Wow.

16:35.020 --> 16:38.500
~ I've never done anything like that.
~ You must have.
~ I haven't.

16:39.660 --> 16:42.000
How'd you meet your husband?

16:42.740 --> 16:44.740
~ Best not.
~ Oh, go on.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.860
It was a traffic accident.

16:54.740 --> 16:56.930
A little old lady in a Nissan Micra.

16:56.980 --> 17:00.780
Gone into the back of a Land Rover.
Bit of a bump. Just minor whiplash.

17:01.900 --> 17:04.640
I was a WPC and Joe was a paramedic.

17:06.380 --> 17:08.369
He was kind and twinkly.

17:08.420 --> 17:11.359
And I thought, "I like
the look of you."

17:12.060 --> 17:14.770
I didn't tell him, though,
for another six weeks.

17:14.819 --> 17:16.890
Then we kept bumping into each other in call-outs.

17:16.940 --> 17:19.940
He said, "We must stop
meeting like this."

17:34.180 --> 17:36.850
Do you think he killed those girls?

17:38.740 --> 17:41.210
I can't bear to think about it.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.410
Do you think he was capable of it?

17:44.460 --> 17:47.660
I don't know. Do you
think your husband was?

17:50.300 --> 17:52.290
Claire, if you did
agree to meet Lee...

17:52.340 --> 17:54.930
I put myself on the line
before and it went wrong

17:54.980 --> 17:57.290
and I ended up a prisoner
down here, Ellie.

17:57.340 --> 18:00.420
~ I understand what you're going through.
~ No, you don't.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.650
But if you're still
hiding, what happens?

18:14.700 --> 18:18.610
~ The Sandbrook family
will never get the truth.
~ Not my responsibility.

18:18.660 --> 18:21.130
I know you don't want it
to be but I think it is.

18:21.180 --> 18:23.920
Look what these men have done to us.

18:24.660 --> 18:27.410
It was like I was addicted to him.

18:27.460 --> 18:29.450
Like he was my drug.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.500
And I broke that habit,
Ellie, and I'm...

18:33.380 --> 18:35.970
.. I'm afraid if I'm near
him again. I'm scared.

18:36.020 --> 18:39.220
~ We'll look after you.
~ Why would you do that?

18:41.060 --> 18:44.460
Cos my life, my old life, is gone.

18:46.460 --> 18:49.290
And I made so many mistakes.
Some big ones.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.530
And I need to put something right.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.720
We could do it together.

19:21.700 --> 19:24.810
When the trial starts tomorrow,
we'll be running a live blog.

19:24.860 --> 19:27.090
There's a dedicated page
on the Echo website

19:27.140 --> 19:29.570
and I will be posting hour
by hour coverage of the trial.

19:29.620 --> 19:32.010
Try not to sound like you're
enjoying it too much.

19:32.060 --> 19:35.370
~ I'm not apologising for what we do.
~ You don't sound so keen.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.530
I assess things once
the dust has settled.

19:37.580 --> 19:41.170
~ Write up the bigger picture.
~ By which time everyone has moved on.

19:41.220 --> 19:44.420
I'm still your boss,
petal, blog or no blog.

19:45.820 --> 19:47.810
Hi, Jocelyn. Thanks for coming.

19:47.860 --> 19:50.330
I had a message you needed
to see me urgently.

19:50.380 --> 19:53.410
Yeah. Everyone, Jocelyn's here.

19:53.460 --> 19:57.410
~ No.
~ Oh, sorry. It just sort of mushroomed.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.450
We wanted to thank everyone
for being witnesses

20:00.500 --> 20:02.490
and giving evidence for Danny.

20:02.540 --> 20:05.410
I just thought you could clue
us in on what to expect.

20:05.460 --> 20:08.530
It's completely inappropriate.
I shouldn't be here.

20:08.580 --> 20:12.180
~ We didn't know.
~ We haven't done this before. Sorry.

20:22.820 --> 20:25.970
A criminal trial is a detailed,
unpredictable process.

20:26.020 --> 20:28.010
There are no guarantees.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.530
We have a difficult task ahead.

20:30.940 --> 20:34.450
If you've been called, don't
confer on your evidence.

20:34.500 --> 20:38.770
And never lie. Lies
get exposed in court.

20:38.820 --> 20:42.140
You're fine there. None of us
have got anything left to hide.

20:45.780 --> 20:49.900
I'll do everything I can to secure a
conviction but it's not just down to me.

20:51.180 --> 20:53.580
It's on everyone in this room.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.890
Everyone in this town.

20:57.980 --> 21:00.720
Now, I - I really shouldn't be here.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.490
Weren't expecting that, were you?

21:12.540 --> 21:14.530
Got ambushed.

21:14.580 --> 21:16.570
How's it going, then?

21:16.620 --> 21:19.290
Are you ready for the battle ahead?

21:21.860 --> 21:23.860
Would you read to me?

21:29.260 --> 21:31.260
Ooh. War room.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.370
You got everything you need?

21:34.420 --> 21:36.930
Only the Wi-Fi's not working.

21:36.980 --> 21:39.250
Yeah, that's down for
the night, I think.

21:39.300 --> 21:43.130
Um, you could use my phone if
you need to send stuff urgently.

21:43.180 --> 21:46.210
No. Thanks.

21:46.260 --> 21:50.170
Hey, erm, she's quite
chatty next door.

21:50.220 --> 21:52.930
I've had complaints from
the room the other side.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.970
The walls aren't the thickest.

21:55.020 --> 21:59.090
Oh. Erm, she's on the phone.
I can't interrupt her.

21:59.140 --> 22:01.130
Do you know when she'll be finished?

22:01.180 --> 22:03.170
I don't know.

22:03.220 --> 22:05.220
Well, thanks.

22:17.860 --> 22:20.370
No, don't say things like that.

22:20.420 --> 22:22.410
Seriously, don't.

22:22.460 --> 22:24.460
I'm not having it.

22:25.420 --> 22:28.050
Look, you've got to
sort yourself out.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.500
Nobody else can do it for you.

22:31.420 --> 22:33.410
You can't change what's happened.

22:33.460 --> 22:36.540
Now it's about what happens
next, and that's down to you.

22:38.540 --> 22:41.420
No. No, actually I do.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.100
All right.

22:48.260 --> 22:50.260
I love you. Yeah.

22:51.780 --> 22:53.780
All right.

22:55.380 --> 22:57.650
All right. Call me again...

23:20.660 --> 23:22.970
She'll do it. Claire's
agreed to meet him.

23:23.020 --> 23:25.130
Oh, man. I could kiss you.

23:25.180 --> 23:29.090
Just promise me that she'll be safe
and you won't do anything reckless.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.140
She'll be safe.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.260
Nothing reckless. She'll be safe.

23:35.940 --> 23:38.460
~ Good night.
~ See you.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.110
Don't fidget, don't
mutter to yourself.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.950
Don't shake your head if a witness
says something you disagree with.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.990
Stay neutral.

24:28.040 --> 24:31.190
Don't make eye contact
with the jury members.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.310
The navy tie is better.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.710
Sorry. Sorry.

24:38.760 --> 24:42.070
Got bloody lost. Thought I'd
cycle in and went the wrong way.

24:42.120 --> 24:46.080
Haven't quite got my,
er, bearings... yet.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.870
So, how are you both?

24:48.920 --> 24:52.310
~ Sharon, nice to see you again.
Jocelyn, don't think we've -
~ No.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.360
Is this the door?

24:55.120 --> 24:58.420
You should see the apartment
they've given me.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.980
Oh, please.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.270
Right.

25:04.320 --> 25:09.910
We are gonna run this with
courtesy, dignity and respect.

25:09.960 --> 25:13.080
For the court, for each other
and for everyone involved.

25:14.560 --> 25:18.630
A boy has been murdered. His family
will be present at all times.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.590
We don't need to compound
their suffering.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.750
I can't believe we have to be
here until we give evidence.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.200
It could be days. I'll go mad.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.700
Are you listening to me?

25:42.840 --> 25:44.830
She'll see you.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.590
I decide when, where
and for how long.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.510
I'll pick you up from
an agreed location.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.550
I'll text you the details.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.110
So she's been with you all along.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.750
It won't be a long meeting
and I'll be watching.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.920
You don't control us.

26:02.840 --> 26:04.080
No.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.040
See you later, then.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.270
~ All right?
~ I need you to do something for me.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.230
Do what?

26:20.280 --> 26:23.150
~ See, plenty of time.
~ Turning up in a plumber's van.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.600
I'll get the garage to look at
the car. Stop worrying about it.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.670
Bloody hell.

26:31.720 --> 26:35.120
It's all right. Don't worry about
it. Just try to ignore them.

26:55.160 --> 27:00.200
The man in the dock, Joe Miller,
killed Daniel Latimer.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.240
Then he moved Danny's
body to a nearby beach.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.110
Forensic evidence places
him at the murder scene.

27:09.160 --> 27:13.320
Mr Miller surrendered to the police
saying he was sick of hiding.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.550
Mr Miller confessed to police.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.430
The facts are clear
and will enable you

27:20.480 --> 27:24.440
to convict Mr Miller of
Daniel Latimer's murder.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.190
Two proper coffees, petal, no foam.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.790
Put your phone down
for once, will you?

27:33.840 --> 27:35.910
I'm just keeping the world informed.

27:35.960 --> 27:39.270
~ About what's happening here?
~ Yeah. People care about you.

27:39.320 --> 27:42.590
~ Want to know you get justice.
~ It'll be fine in there, petal.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.710
You'll do brilliantly.

27:46.520 --> 27:49.200
~ Mum, they're asking for you.
~ OK.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.880
When was the last time
you saw your son alive?

27:58.240 --> 28:01.680
I looked in on him around
nine that night.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.950
We'd all had tea together
just after six.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.600
Mark had gone out.

28:09.280 --> 28:13.790
Me and Chloe were watching telly.
Danny was in his bedroom.

28:13.840 --> 28:18.710
Had music on. I told him he had till
half nine then he had to go to bed.

28:18.760 --> 28:23.150
And Danny gave no indication that he would
be meeting anyone later in the night?

28:23.200 --> 28:25.280
No. Nothing.

28:26.320 --> 28:29.260
There was nothing to
make me think, I...

28:30.040 --> 28:32.510
I replay that moment every day.

28:32.880 --> 28:37.150
Shutting the door on him,
all the things I didn't ask.

28:37.200 --> 28:41.070
How it would have been different
if I'd been a better parent.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.110
Thank you, Mrs Latimer.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.430
Stay where you are, please.

28:53.040 --> 28:57.600
As a mum myself, I know it must
be difficult. I'll keep it short.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.800
How was your marriage at
the time of Danny's death?

29:02.920 --> 29:04.920
Fine.

29:06.800 --> 29:10.190
Had you or your husband
ever had an affair?

29:10.240 --> 29:12.980
What's that got to do with anything?

29:13.840 --> 29:16.670
~ Can she ask that?
~ Yes, she can.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.560
And the court needs you to answer.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.390
My husband slept with Becca Fisher.

29:31.440 --> 29:34.000
She owns the Traders Hotel.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.670
Did Danny know about it?

29:38.720 --> 29:41.910
Yes. I found out later that he did.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.950
Did you ever hit Danny?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.070
~ No.
~ Did your husband?

29:48.920 --> 29:51.320
~ Mrs Latimer?
~ What's going on?

29:52.080 --> 29:54.070
Who's on trial here?

29:54.120 --> 29:56.110
You need to answer the question.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.790
Is it not enough that my son
was murdered by that man there

29:59.840 --> 30:03.710
and that I lost my mum three months
back because she was broken by this?

30:03.760 --> 30:08.750
Now I've got to stand here while you ask
me about things that aren't connected.

30:08.800 --> 30:13.600
Mrs Latimer, did your husband
Mark ever hit Danny?

30:17.680 --> 30:19.670
Once. It was only once.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.720
Thank you.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.470
No re-examination, My Lady.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.640
Thank you, Mrs Latimer.
You are released.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.870
Has anyone noticed I'm not there?

30:42.920 --> 30:45.310
They came over, I said
you'd gone to the loo.

30:45.360 --> 30:49.270
~ You won't be called for
days. Are you there yet?
~ I'm not sure about this.

30:49.320 --> 30:52.390
We have got one opportunity
and we need to be all over it.

30:52.440 --> 30:55.790
Why here? Why not in
a hotel room or a park?

30:55.840 --> 30:57.630
We need to control
access front and back.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.590
It has to be somewhere
we know the layout.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.110
It's a totally neutral location.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.270
Not for me, it's not.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.830
It's just, I've never been back in.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.870
Detective Hardy.

31:10.920 --> 31:15.040
Ohhhh. I'm being called. Bloody
hell. I'll call when I'm done.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.230
DI Hardy, you were
the arresting officer.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.270
Correct.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.830
I'd like you to take us through
the events of Mr Miller's arrest.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.550
Where did the arrest take place?

31:28.600 --> 31:30.600
At Mr Miller's house.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.280
I love you, Miller.

32:25.960 --> 32:29.350
You coerced Joe Miller into saying
he killed Daniel Latimer,

32:29.400 --> 32:31.400
didn't you, DI Hardy?

32:32.200 --> 32:35.670
No. I found him in the
shed with the phone.

32:35.720 --> 32:39.470
And he confessed, as I
have recorded in my notes.

32:39.520 --> 32:44.430
I suggest that Joe Miller
found Daniel Latimer's phone

32:44.480 --> 32:49.110
and was about to report it to the
police when you arrived alone

32:49.160 --> 32:52.990
and jumped to a false conclusion
because it suited your purposes.

32:53.040 --> 32:56.030
~ What purpose would that be?
~ You were under pressure.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.070
You needed a result, didn't you?

32:58.120 --> 33:00.430
There's always pressure
to find a killer.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.030
Hadn't you just been labelled

33:03.080 --> 33:06.150
Britain's worst cop
by the national press?

33:06.200 --> 33:09.950
~ One paper.
~ Are we letting the media judge this trial?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.990
Or are we sticking to facts?

33:12.040 --> 33:15.470
Stick with the events of
the arrest, Miss Bishop.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.510
Absolutely.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.830
Let's move to the station.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.580
When was a doctor called
for Mr Miller?

33:28.240 --> 33:30.990
I believe it was around 2:15pm.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.310
Why did you call a doctor?

33:34.800 --> 33:37.350
Mr Miller had sustained an injury.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.390
Injuries, plural.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.110
He sustained a broken rib

33:42.160 --> 33:46.150
and bruising to the neck,
chest and torso. Correct?

33:46.200 --> 33:48.200
Yes.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.760
How did he get these injuries?

33:55.960 --> 34:01.270
DI Hardy, how did the defendant
sustain injuries

34:01.320 --> 34:04.920
while in custody at Broadchurch
police station?

34:08.960 --> 34:15.550
After DS Miller learned of her husband,
the defendant's, confession,

34:15.600 --> 34:17.590
she asked to see him.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.630
Against allowed procedure.

34:19.679 --> 34:21.670
Yes.

34:21.719 --> 34:23.710
~ Who allowed this visit?
~ I did.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.909
I supervised, along with
two other officers.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.960
What happened?

34:32.560 --> 34:35.159
DS Miller attacked the defendant.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.550
She kicked the living daylights
out of him, didn't she?

34:40.600 --> 34:45.030
And you - you just stood there
and watched, didn't you?

34:45.080 --> 34:48.790
No. As soon as she started attacking
him, I called in other officers

34:48.840 --> 34:50.830
and they removed DS Miller.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.880
It was my error.

34:54.199 --> 34:58.910
It had been... a long and
emotional investigation.

34:58.960 --> 35:02.470
How many other times was the defendant
beaten while in custody?

35:02.520 --> 35:08.790
~ None.
~ Did you use violence against the
defendant at the house in order
to get him to make a confession?

35:08.840 --> 35:11.790
~ Absolutely not.
~ Why should we believe you?

35:11.840 --> 35:14.510
An officer who, by his own admission,

35:14.560 --> 35:19.190
stood by and watched as a
colleague beat up a suspect.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.510
~ No, that's not how it happened.
~ The defence applies to have

35:22.560 --> 35:28.510
the defendant's confession excluded
pursuant to Section 76 and 78 of Pace.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.550
The confession is on camera.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.310
The injuries were sustained
after he confessed.

35:33.360 --> 35:36.350
We cannot discount the possibility
that the injuries

35:36.400 --> 35:39.600
were sustained before his arrival
at the police station.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.920
I agree with the defence.

35:52.200 --> 35:56.280
I am minded to exclude the
confession from evidence.

36:01.800 --> 36:05.320
Members of the jury, you are
to disregard it entirely.

36:19.340 --> 36:21.340
All right. Thanks.

36:29.140 --> 36:31.140
Well, what happened?

36:32.500 --> 36:34.490
The confession's been excluded.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.530
Sorry, Miller.

36:36.580 --> 36:38.580
Right.

36:41.740 --> 36:43.730
It's done. It's gone.

36:43.780 --> 36:47.080
Nothing to be done. Try
not to think about it.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.930
You go fetch Claire.

36:49.980 --> 36:51.980
Go on.

36:53.860 --> 36:55.860
Ta.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.610
Do you tell Mrs Latimer we meet?

37:38.660 --> 37:40.660
~ No.
~ Why not?

37:42.340 --> 37:44.340
I don't know.

37:45.100 --> 37:47.500
Why did you suggest it, then?

37:53.580 --> 37:55.980
Maybe it's cos I think that...

37:57.500 --> 38:00.900
.. if it was the other way round
and Dan had been left behind...

38:03.620 --> 38:07.220
.. I'd want someone looking
out for him. You know?

38:08.940 --> 38:11.680
Part of me feels that it's my fault.

38:14.060 --> 38:17.420
What happened to Dan and
what happened to all of us.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.090
Just feel like I'm responsible.

38:23.140 --> 38:25.140
You know?

38:27.020 --> 38:30.610
And I can see it in everyone's faces
when they look at me. Everyone's.

38:30.660 --> 38:32.260
All the time.

38:34.260 --> 38:37.000
I'm trying to make it better. But...

38:43.020 --> 38:46.100
.. but I know I never can. You know?

39:27.980 --> 39:30.970
Alec'll be in the kitchen and
I'll be by the front door.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.760
~ If you're OK with that.
~ Sounds good.

39:34.260 --> 39:36.260
~ Are you sure?
~ Yeah.

39:39.380 --> 39:41.650
I've got a bit of butterflies, actually.

39:41.700 --> 39:45.970
~ Really?
~ It's all right. He would
never do anything to harm me.

39:46.020 --> 39:48.010
He's never been rough with me.

39:48.060 --> 39:50.130
Not unless I've asked.

39:56.220 --> 39:58.210
So, where is she?

39:58.260 --> 40:00.260
This way.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.090
Beth.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.130
Nige. How many times? You can't
just come in like that.

40:12.180 --> 40:15.380
~ I've just seen Ellie.
She's back in her house.
~ What?

40:16.780 --> 40:18.780
This way.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.100
Give me your coat.

40:47.060 --> 40:49.050
I'll keep the coat.

40:49.100 --> 40:52.380
~ Do you wanna pat me down as well?
~ Yeah, if you're offering.

41:10.700 --> 41:13.890
~ You haven't made her wear
a wire or anything, have you?
~ No.

41:13.940 --> 41:15.940
Front room.

41:24.660 --> 41:26.400
We're coming in.

41:27.820 --> 41:29.650
OK.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.640
~ You all right?
~ Mm.

41:40.660 --> 41:42.660
~ You ready?
~ Yeah.

41:50.460 --> 41:52.600
First door on the right.

41:58.820 --> 42:00.420
OK. She's in.

42:08.100 --> 42:12.210
I'll be in the kitchen. Miller
will be by the front door.

42:12.260 --> 42:14.250
You've got 15 minutes.

42:14.300 --> 42:17.060
~ OK.
~ You all right?
~ Yeah.

42:27.260 --> 42:29.330
Oh, God. I missed you.

42:30.740 --> 42:32.740
You OK?

42:33.940 --> 42:36.880
Yeah. I thought I'd
never see you again.

42:39.700 --> 42:42.300
~ Has he made you record this?
~ No.

42:43.140 --> 42:45.880
I promise. No wire. There's nothing.

42:46.660 --> 42:48.930
"I'm in position. Outside."

43:03.300 --> 43:05.300
I need to check.

43:26.820 --> 43:28.810
Are you sure she's safe?

43:28.860 --> 43:31.530
~ Course. I'm recording everything.
~ What? How?

43:31.580 --> 43:35.170
~ Cameras.
~ You're bugging my house? Is that
legal? You could have told me.

43:35.220 --> 43:37.810
I'm telling you now. I'm not
leaving them alone, am I?

43:37.860 --> 43:39.860
Ellie.

43:41.580 --> 43:44.850
~ Oh, God.
~ Do you know what happened in court today?

43:44.900 --> 43:48.050
~ Beth, I'm sorry.
~ His whole confession gone because of you.

43:48.100 --> 43:49.410
Miller, what's going on?

43:49.460 --> 43:51.330
So what is this? You
think you can move back?

43:51.380 --> 43:53.890
Walk past my window like
nothing's happened?

43:53.940 --> 43:55.940
No. Listen.

43:59.140 --> 44:01.810
~ Is this what you did to Joe?
~ Beth, don't push me.

44:01.860 --> 44:04.650
Why not? I'm enjoying it. I'll
do more than push you in a minute.

44:04.700 --> 44:06.690
Beth, this isn't the time.

44:06.740 --> 44:11.130
~ Please, don't do this.
~ You knew that if you beat him
up, kick the shit out of him,

44:11.180 --> 44:13.650
~ it would give him a chance to get off.
~ God, no.

44:13.700 --> 44:16.370
He's not gonna walk. He's
guilty. We all know it.

44:16.420 --> 44:19.820
Oh! Oh, shit.

44:24.780 --> 44:26.300
Claire!

44:29.260 --> 44:31.570
~ Oh, Beth, your waters.
~ See what you've done.

44:31.620 --> 44:33.610
Shit. Shit!

44:33.660 --> 44:35.970
Will you get away from me?!
