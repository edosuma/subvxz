13:56.753 --> 13:57.753
Oh, don't be silly.

13:57.921 --> 14:02.299
It is not in my DNA to just wave goodbye
to a stunning woman after a meal.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.092
Well, that's really sweet.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.929
It's unnecessary, but...

14:09.057 --> 14:11.350
- Ray?
- Tanya.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.771
- Ray, you remember Floyd.
- Hi, Floyd.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.774
FLOYD:
Ray. We've missed you in class.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.030
I'll be going, Tanya. I don't want
to get involved in a lovers' quarrel.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.700
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, no, there's no lovers' quarrel.
We're not lovers.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.327
There's clearly an energy, so...

14:30.495 --> 14:32.579
Would you like to come in
and have tea?

14:32.747 --> 14:35.541
No, no, no, I can't impose. Good night.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.294
You were gonna invite that guy in?

14:39.462 --> 14:43.465
- Sometimes tea is just tea, Ray.
- Not in your world.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.301
You know what?
In fact, I think the guy is sweet.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.595
And actually,
I made a New Year's resolution...

14:48.763 --> 14:52.849
...not to disregard someone just because
he's not some masculine ideal.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.645
Because I find that most
of the good-looking guys are all jerks.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.064
Let's change the subject, Tanya.

14:59.232 --> 15:03.652
Somebody put $400 on my credit cards.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.153
Now I'm over the limit.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.406
- That's horrible.
- Yeah.

15:07.574 --> 15:12.995
And I gotta say, it's either Lenore...

15:13.538 --> 15:14.663
...or it's you.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.248
Me?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.749
Oh, my God.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.669
I'm the last person
who would steal money from you.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.296
I don't know that. I'm...

15:22.463 --> 15:25.340
I don't even know
if I'm coming or going here.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.137
Ray, she didn't pay you anything.

15:30.305 --> 15:34.474
I messed up, okay? She paid zero.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.436
So how...?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.855
How did l...?

15:40.356 --> 15:43.483
I put it there. I lied.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.863
You put that money in my wallet?

15:50.074 --> 15:52.784
You're telling me I fucked that bitch
for free?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.786
Ray, that sounds misogynistic.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.789
Misogynistic?
Don't even start with that.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.833
"Fuck the bitch?"
"I fucked that bitch?"

16:00.001 --> 16:01.710
Yeah, I fucked that bitch for free...

16:01.878 --> 16:03.962
...and now my credit cards
are all maxed out.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.715
Ray, I cannot be partners
with someone who hates women.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.551
Hey, hey, hey, I love women, Tanya.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.721
But Lenore is a control-freak,
hickey-sucking pain in my ass.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.223
- I gave you the money.
- Exactly.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.769
What kind of a stupid pimp move is that?

16:18.936 --> 16:22.230
- I did it to make you feel better.
- Fuck that. I don't want your pity.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.524
Let's just face facts here, okay, Tanya?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.193
You...

16:26.944 --> 16:28.487
...are a horrible pimp.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.489
I am not.

- Yeah.

16:36.746 --> 16:40.624
- You are the worst pimp in the world!
- Fuck you, Ray.

16:40.792 --> 16:46.088
- Fuck you. I am an excellent pimp.
- Oh, yeah? I quit.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.258
What kind of pimp are you now?

BRIAN [ON PHONE]:
I can't start with no pay, Ray.

17:01.813 --> 17:06.316
I know, Brian.
I was thinking by maybe next week?

17:06.484 --> 17:09.695
Maybe sooner, even. I don't know.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.488
Brian?

17:11.656 --> 17:13.490
Are you there?

17:14.534 --> 17:18.495
Look, I got this other job, Ray.
I kind of need to take it.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.747
Yeah, I...

17:23.710 --> 17:26.128

It's always great to walk with a friend.

20:02.451 --> 20:06.079
- I mean, I'd like to think we're friends.
- Strange friends.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.832
Lots of friends are strange.

20:10.293 --> 20:13.169
- Do you forgive me?
- Hey.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.839
I'm not one to hold a grudge.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.966
And thanks for the cookies.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.634
Yeah.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.303
Now take your money back.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.972
No, you earned it, Ray.
It's what she should have paid.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.682
- Tanya, forget about it.
- No, God.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.685
- Come on. Hey.
- No, keep the money.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.605

20:31.772 --> 20:32.939
- Tanya?
- I've been...

20:33.107 --> 20:36.109
- You were right. I've been a terrible pimp.
- Jeez.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.738
- At least not very excellent.
- Well, it's a hard job.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.531
I blew it.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.826
I mean, I thought Lenore
would come through.

20:44.994 --> 20:48.663
Instead she ends up stealing your wallet
and your underwear...

20:48.831 --> 20:50.248
...and she just lies to me.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.042
God, what is wrong with me?

20:52.209 --> 20:55.503
Why can't I see people
for who they really are?

20:56.339 --> 20:59.174
- It could happen to anybody.
- I know, but it happens to me.

20:59.342 --> 21:00.926
Over and over.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.846
My mother was right.
I'm too desperate to be liked.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.140
Your mother said that? That's horrible.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.351
Don't go there, Ray.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.275
If it's any consolation...

21:17.443 --> 21:21.655
...I want you to know that I'd do better.
If we ever worked together again...

21:21.822 --> 21:26.534
- Come on, Tanya, let's just drop it.
- No, I'm not saying we would.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.454
I just mean I'd improve...

21:29.622 --> 21:31.665

- I'm great, sweetheart.

21:40.216 --> 21:44.302
So is she, like,
diseased or dying or something?

21:44.971 --> 21:47.180
No, she's just resting.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.641
But she pees on herself.

21:50.059 --> 21:53.395
Oh. She's old. It's mostly water.

such an old messed-up dog?

22:00.903 --> 22:02.570
She needed us.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.323
She was a service dog, and now...

22:06.158 --> 22:07.993
...she's of no service.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.579
That's cool.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.166
Kind of. She's barely moving.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.086
That's because she has arthritis.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.256
You see the indentions on her neck?

22:21.424 --> 22:24.801
That's where the harness used to go.

He doesn't tell me.

You had to needle and bother...

I need you to leave, Ray.
I'm asking you very clearly to go home.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.194
Oh, I'm leaving.
But not before I give you this.
