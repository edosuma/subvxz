12:07.369 --> 12:09.599
-Don't wory.
-Can I see it?

12:09.638 --> 12:14.132
Hey. Dude, it's just been one
of those days, you know?

12:14.176 --> 12:15.768
MATT.: Yes, I do.

12:15.811 --> 12:18.678
I got held up at this import-
export place in Chinatown.

12:18.714 --> 12:20.682
Some party.

12:20.716 --> 12:22.911
-Golden Spear?
-That's the one.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.545
Their mimosas they make there
are strong.

12:25.587 --> 12:27.487
Go straight to your head.
Blbbh.

12:29.191 --> 12:31.489
I used to know someone
who worked there.

12:31.527 --> 12:33.495
You know Tatiana?

12:33.529 --> 12:35.224
Yeah, I know Tatiana.
She's nice.

12:35.264 --> 12:36.561
No, she's not nice.
She's hot.

12:36.598 --> 12:38.657
I'd hit that.
And how about Merj?

12:38.700 --> 12:40.224
Yeah, I know Merj.

12:40.269 --> 12:42.737
And what about that really
hot chick that got engaged?

12:42.771 --> 12:44.534
That was funny.

12:44.573 --> 12:45.972
What really hot chick
got engaged?

12:46.008 --> 12:50.206
The expediter chick.
You know, real slinky.

-What's her name?
-Nicole?

12:52.514 --> 12:53.742
Nicole. That's it.

12:53.782 --> 12:55.750
Man, she knows the guy,
like, two weeks.

12:55.784 --> 12:58.184
She goes to France,
she comes back, she's engaged.

12:58.220 --> 13:00.586
Now, she is
spontaneous combustion hot.

13:00.622 --> 13:03.750
-I would definitely hit that.

13:03.792 --> 13:07.387
How do you know it's Nicole--
N-Nicole that got engaged?

13:07.429 --> 13:09.863
Dude, that's what the banner
said at the party.

13:09.898 --> 13:11.991
''Congratulations Nicole.''

13:12.034 --> 13:13.831
Whew. I can't believe it...

13:13.869 --> 13:15.700
because that girI, you can't
even Iook right at her.

13:15.737 --> 13:19.229
She's so hot you need one of
those eclipse-watching things...

13:19.274 --> 13:22.038
just to look directly at her,
she's so radiantly hot!

13:22.077 --> 13:24.739
It makes me want to just
throw her down, you know...

13:24.780 --> 13:27.248

You know what I mean?

13:27.282 --> 13:29.113
Yeah.

13:29.151 --> 13:30.982
I'm glad we can connect on that.

Hey, Matt--

13:49.838 --> 13:51.863

14:46.161 --> 14:48.254

-Oh! Oh!

14:48.297 --> 14:51.528
-Oh, God. I am so sory.
-It's OK. It's OK.

14:51.566 --> 14:53.534
-Are you OK?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

14:53.568 --> 14:56.935
Is there anything I can do
to make it better?

14:56.972 --> 14:59.338
Um...

14:59.374 --> 15:00.966

NicoIe's getting married.

15:14.923 --> 15:17.357
I'm sory.

15:17.392 --> 15:19.826
I mean, what can I do?

15:19.861 --> 15:23.456
-Tell me what I can do.
-I don't know what to tell you.

15:23.498 --> 15:26.399
This isn't really a problem
I know much about.

15:28.537 --> 15:30.164
Listen, isn't
part of the priestly thing...

15:30.205 --> 15:32.400
giving relationship advice?

15:32.441 --> 15:34.909
Relationship advice, yes.

15:34.943 --> 15:37.070
Sex advice, no.

15:37.112 --> 15:39.808
Part of the priestly thing,
and stop calling it that...

15:39.848 --> 15:41.247
is not to have sex, remember?

15:41.283 --> 15:43.717
It's funny.
I didn't say a thing about sex.

15:43.752 --> 15:45.947
-Sure you did.
-No, I didn't.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.889
I guess thinking about sex
is part of the priestly thing.

15:48.924 --> 15:50.050
At least for some.

15:50.092 --> 15:53.084
-Get out.
-Fine.

15:58.300 --> 16:02.760
-Good morning, Matt.
-Morning, father.

16:02.804 --> 16:04.533
What's with the purple banners?

16:04.573 --> 16:07.371
Lent. Starts today.

16:07.409 --> 16:09.934
Going to be a long forty days
this year.

16:09.978 --> 16:12.276
I'm giving up my one vice--

16:12.314 --> 16:15.044
those precious little
madeleine cookies...

16:15.083 --> 16:17.608
dipped in a starbucks mocha.

16:17.652 --> 16:21.850
It's so hard giving up
what you love the most.

16:26.228 --> 16:29.197
I've got it! Jesus Christ,
John, I've got an answer!

16:29.231 --> 16:30.528
And the question is?

16:30.565 --> 16:31.896
-Nicole.
-Again?

16:31.933 --> 16:34.868
No sex for Lent--
for forty days.

16:34.903 --> 16:36.894
If I can do that,
then everything will be OK.

16:36.938 --> 16:38.166
That isn't what Lent is.

16:38.206 --> 16:41.403
Lent is about sacrifice
and growth through self-denial.

16:41.443 --> 16:42.603
Lent is to remember--

16:42.644 --> 16:45.579
How Christ felt
during the fast in the desert.

16:45.614 --> 16:47.377
I grew up in the same house
as you, moron.

16:47.416 --> 16:49.782
But when it comes down to it,
that's exactly what this is.

16:49.818 --> 16:51.979
This is growth,
this is self-denial...

16:52.020 --> 16:55.217
and this is sacrifice.

16:55.257 --> 16:58.420
Dude!

16:58.460 --> 17:00.223
It's not that simple, Matt.
Trust me.

17:00.262 --> 17:01.422
It is that...

17:03.732 --> 17:06.598
You're right.

17:06.635 --> 17:09.968
You're totally right.

17:10.005 --> 17:12.734
Sex alone is not enough.

17:12.773 --> 17:15.242
It has to be sex
and all things sex-like.

17:15.277 --> 17:17.268
You'll never be able to do that.

17:17.311 --> 17:19.007

no sexual intimacy of any kind.

17:24.653 --> 17:27.087
No nibbling, no biting,
no scratching.

17:27.122 --> 17:30.853
No sucking, no fondIing.
None of that.

That's the way it is with me.

36:40.441 --> 36:42.272
I mean, was with me.

36:42.309 --> 36:46.905
Back in my more youthful,
wasted, younger days.

36:46.947 --> 36:48.847
Ahem. This is me.

36:51.452 --> 36:54.319
I've never had so much fun
on a bus before.

36:55.789 --> 36:56.949
Me, too.

36:59.693 --> 37:01.627
[Laughs]

37:05.165 --> 37:07.156
[Sighs]

37:12.406 --> 37:14.533
Good night.

37:16.710 --> 37:18.940
Good night.

37:18.979 --> 37:22.107
I'll--Unh! Whoa! Aah!

37:22.149 --> 37:26.313
-Ow.
-W-watch that.

37:26.353 --> 37:29.845
-I'll talk to you soon, OK?
-OK.

37:29.890 --> 37:32.017
Vey soon. Like tomorrow.
I'll give you a call.

37:32.059 --> 37:34.527
-Great.
-Bye!

37:34.561 --> 37:36.461
Bye.

37:38.499 --> 37:44.096
-Like, a high five?
-No. More like a ''Gimme five.''

37:44.138 --> 37:46.265
He's got a girlfriend.

37:46.307 --> 37:48.901
Some guys are just different
about this stuff, you know.

37:48.942 --> 37:53.276
Mm-hmm. Gay is different
to some people.

37:53.314 --> 37:56.477
Well, I trust him.
That means a lot.

37:56.517 --> 37:58.781
Is this anything like
the last guy you trusted...

37:58.819 --> 38:01.913
who stole half your jewely
and sold it on eBay?

38:01.955 --> 38:05.118
Apparently, speed
is a vey expensive drug, Sam.

38:05.159 --> 38:07.024
Dude, you are so gone.

38:07.061 --> 38:09.222
No, I love hanging out
with him. He's amazing.

38:09.263 --> 38:11.731
I'm treated like an equal,
and we're connecting--

38:11.765 --> 38:13.892
-It sucks, doesn't it?
-Yeah, it does.

38:13.934 --> 38:15.799
It totally sucks.

38:15.836 --> 38:17.428
Why doesn't he just
want to have sex with me?

38:17.905 --> 38:19.873
So, how did it go last night,
champ?

38:19.907 --> 38:21.568
What?

38:21.608 --> 38:23.872
With your date.
Did you hit that or what?

38:23.911 --> 38:25.242
What--what--

38:26.547 --> 38:28.742
-[Coughs]
-What are you talking about?

38:28.782 --> 38:31.774
[Coughs] Nothing.
Whoo. That was weird.

38:31.819 --> 38:33.878
No more drugs pour moi.

38:36.123 --> 38:38.023
What the fuck is going on?

38:39.893 --> 38:41.053
[Wolf whistle]

38:41.095 --> 38:42.357
[Clank]

38:42.396 --> 38:44.387
MATT.: You guys put up
a web page about me?

38:44.431 --> 38:47.025
CHRIS.: Web page? PIease.
Be more insuIting, man.

38:47.067 --> 38:49.900
This is a complicated
betting pool.

38:49.937 --> 38:51.097
[Train honking]

38:51.138 --> 38:52.264
You guys can't make this public.

38:52.306 --> 38:56.743
This is not something that
I want eveyone to know about.

38:56.777 --> 38:58.768
It's a little too late, dude.

38:58.812 --> 39:03.579
Today's bets. Originally,
the spread favored day 26...

39:03.617 --> 39:06.142
but with aII the dating action
in MattIand these days...

39:06.186 --> 39:08.245
I'm gonna recommend day 23.

39:08.288 --> 39:09.482
[Ka-ching]

39:09.523 --> 39:10.888
CHRIS.: Someone just pIaced
another bet.

39:10.924 --> 39:13.893
I had one come in all the way
from Bangladesh.

39:13.927 --> 39:17.419
Little Haji
just loves to roll the dice.

39:17.464 --> 39:19.329
You guys have advertisers?

39:19.366 --> 39:22.995
A friend of mine
started up a business...

39:23.036 --> 39:24.901
and I gave him a good price.

39:24.938 --> 39:26.496
A porn site!

39:29.243 --> 39:30.801
Oh, shit!

39:39.420 --> 39:41.888
++ You feII down ++

39:41.922 --> 39:45.881
++ Dropped it in water ++

39:45.926 --> 39:48.360
Hey! You know where
Erica Sutton is?

39:48.395 --> 39:50.386
-Yeah. She's...
-Where?

39:50.431 --> 39:53.127
You're that guy.
The abstinence guy.

39:53.167 --> 39:54.998
Hey, it's the abstinence guy!

39:55.035 --> 39:57.503
[Men laughing]

40:02.910 --> 40:04.901
What is this, some kind
of a bet not to sleep with me?

40:04.945 --> 40:06.742
No, this isn't a bet.
Let me explain.

40:06.780 --> 40:08.509
Don't explain.
You don't have to.

40:08.549 --> 40:12.110
I just read about it
over the fucking internet.

40:12.152 --> 40:15.246
Erica! Erica, I should have
told you about this.

40:15.289 --> 40:17.519
I thought you'd think
I was a freak. I'm sory.

40:17.558 --> 40:19.856
I can't believe the load of
bullshit that you fed to me...

40:19.893 --> 40:21.019
about telling the damn truth.

40:21.061 --> 40:23.825
I--I did this for myself.

40:23.864 --> 40:26.628
I didn't think anybody else
knew about it. I swear to God.

40:26.667 --> 40:29.397
Plus, if I told you,
you'd think I was a sex addict.

40:29.436 --> 40:30.630
-Are you?
-No!

40:30.671 --> 40:32.161
Then what is the point?

40:32.206 --> 40:34.231
What is the point
of this whole thing?

40:34.274 --> 40:37.505
I just wanted to see
what it would be like...

40:37.544 --> 40:39.637
without all the shit
that sex brings to the picture.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.944
Oh, so I'm like
some science experiment?

40:41.982 --> 40:45.247
No! I--Look, I was going
through a really rough time...

40:45.285 --> 40:46.980
and I just wanted to stop.

40:47.020 --> 40:49.011
I wanted to stop
thinking about sex.

40:49.056 --> 40:50.614
Not that I was thinking
about sex all the time...

40:50.657 --> 40:54.115
I just wanted to stop.

40:54.161 --> 40:57.961
And the thing is, it's working.
It's really working.

40:57.998 --> 41:00.057
I'm glad it's working
for one of us.

41:02.169 --> 41:03.898
[Matt sighs]

41:06.540 --> 41:10.306
You stupid, stupid,
silly little person!

41:10.344 --> 41:12.608
Why did you have to go
and tell eveyone?

41:12.646 --> 41:15.513
Look, if you're so ashamed,
maybe you shouldn't be doing it.

41:15.549 --> 41:18.677
I'm not ashamed!
I'm embarrassed!

41:18.719 --> 41:21.279
Then quit, Matt. Just quit.

41:21.321 --> 41:23.255
Nobody thinks
you'll finish this thing.

41:23.290 --> 41:24.780
I'm not fucking quitting.

41:24.825 --> 41:29.853
Everything was going great
until you had to...

41:29.897 --> 41:32.127
I stopped having sex...

41:32.165 --> 41:34.065
I'm totally
falling for Erica...

41:34.101 --> 41:36.467
and I'm finally over Nicole.

41:36.503 --> 41:37.629
You really think
you're over her?

41:37.671 --> 41:40.401
Fuck, yeah! Bitch.

41:40.440 --> 41:44.968
Hmm. I ran into her
and her fiancé last night.

41:50.951 --> 41:53.215
What was he like?

41:54.955 --> 41:57.685
He--he parties
with a friend of mine.

41:57.724 --> 41:59.589
Apparently, the dude
works late evey night.

41:59.626 --> 42:00.718
That's what I heard.

42:02.829 --> 42:03.955
So?

42:03.997 --> 42:07.330
He works late evey night--
a different girl evey night.

42:07.367 --> 42:09.164
Not that
it should matter to you.

42:09.202 --> 42:11.295
No.
Why would it matter to me?

42:11.338 --> 42:13.067
Yeah.

42:17.678 --> 42:20.169
JERRY.: My wife and I have
been married for eight years.

42:20.213 --> 42:23.114
I love her vey much.

42:23.150 --> 42:27.587
I...consider myself
a lucky person.

42:27.621 --> 42:30.021
That being said...

42:30.057 --> 42:31.922
this woman...

42:31.959 --> 42:36.225
does not put out at all.

42:36.263 --> 42:38.254
I mean, at all.

42:38.298 --> 42:40.698
I mean, we used to have sex
everywhere.

42:40.734 --> 42:43.430
We used to have sex
in this office.

42:43.470 --> 42:47.668
We had sex on this floor.
We had sex on this desk.

42:47.708 --> 42:51.041
-On that chair.
-OK. I get it, I get it.

42:51.078 --> 42:53.308
But now, I have
to practically beg for it.

42:53.347 --> 42:57.181
I mean, it was kind of hot
for the first eight months.

42:57.217 --> 42:59.276
The chasing after her...

42:59.319 --> 43:03.449
surprising her
with my sexy new underwear.

43:03.490 --> 43:08.359
But now,
I feeI a IittIe Iike a...

43:08.395 --> 43:10.727
like I'm a pervert.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.560
I heard about the vow...

43:15.602 --> 43:17.570
and I think it's genius.

43:17.604 --> 43:19.595
Thanks.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.130
I mean, this is
the perfect way for me...

43:21.174 --> 43:23.904
to regain the power
in my relationship.

43:23.944 --> 43:25.411
See, I take the vow.

43:25.445 --> 43:29.176
I tell her I'm gonna do without
for a few months.

43:29.216 --> 43:32.708
I bet in half the time she's
going to be begging for it.

43:32.753 --> 43:34.015
Don't you think?
What do you think?

43:34.054 --> 43:38.013
I think you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

43:42.996 --> 43:46.454
Hey, put that away. Books
get you in trouble around here.

43:46.500 --> 43:49.230
-I can't work right now.
-So go home.

43:49.269 --> 43:52.705
-I need the money.
-So work.

43:52.739 --> 43:55.003
It all reminds me of Matt.

43:55.042 --> 43:58.910
Even ''donkey lovers''?

44:01.648 --> 44:04.242
Call him or leave.

If I told you, ''Don't think
about the color red...''

44:57.170 --> 44:58.330
what would you think about?

45:00.207 --> 45:01.333
Sex.

45:01.374 --> 45:02.966
[Laughs]

45:03.009 --> 45:05.000
OK, so we're both sitting here
thinking about sex...

45:05.045 --> 45:06.569
because
we can't think about sex...

45:06.613 --> 45:08.103
because
we can't taIk about sex...

45:08.148 --> 45:11.140
and we certainly cannot
have sex.

45:11.184 --> 45:14.676
It's like,
so what are we doing here?

45:14.721 --> 45:17.383
You know, if I didn't have
this vow thing...

45:17.424 --> 45:19.255

of those dot coms, don't you?

to give it one more ty?

Yeah, you, too.

47:20.513 --> 47:21.673
Bye.

47:27.754 --> 47:30.086
She's the real reason
you took that vow.

47:32.225 --> 47:34.750
[Sighs] No.
She's just an ex.

47:36.596 --> 47:38.962
The vow is something
completely separate from her.

47:38.999 --> 47:41.593
You're a really bad liar.

47:41.635 --> 47:43.432
I get that a lot.

47:45.639 --> 47:46.901
Look, I know I should've
told you about her.

47:46.940 --> 47:48.100
Yeah, you should've.

47:48.141 --> 47:50.006
But I guess it's hard for you
to get the truth out.

47:55.582 --> 47:56.913
Shit.

47:59.853 --> 48:02.253
Hey, how about I quit the vow?

48:02.289 --> 48:04.314
I mean, honestly,
I don't care about the vow.

48:04.357 --> 48:06.018
Oh, sure, now
St. Matt wants a piece.

48:06.059 --> 48:08.619
-No, that's not it at all.
-You don't want me?

48:08.662 --> 48:11.426
No, of course I want you.
It's just--

48:11.464 --> 48:14.126

48:14.167 --> 48:16.635
I care about the vow, and--

48:16.670 --> 48:19.332
-You do?
-Yeah, I do.

48:19.372 --> 48:22.102
And her?

48:24.377 --> 48:25.537
I don't know.

48:30.450 --> 48:32.247
[Sighs]

48:33.253 --> 48:36.017
I'll tell you what.
You want me?

48:36.056 --> 48:37.546
Yeah.

48:37.590 --> 48:39.649
Then finish your stupid vow.

48:39.693 --> 48:40.819

I know
I shouldn't be here...

but I've been thinking
about you a lot...

01:26:15.846 --> 01:26:19.646
++ Ooh, oh ++

01:26:21.686 --> 01:26:24.484
++ And though ++

01:26:24.522 --> 01:26:27.650
++ You steaI her ++

01:26:27.692 --> 01:26:33.028
++ You Iove her
and deceive her ++

01:26:33.064 --> 01:26:38.263
++ She did nothing ++

01:26:38.302 --> 01:26:41.271
++ So wrong ++

01:26:41.305 --> 01:26:47.505
++ So wrong ++

01:27:05.463 --> 01:27:07.294
++ Oh ++

01:27:07.331 --> 01:27:09.526
Helps with static cling.

01:27:09.567 --> 01:27:16.131
++ And I Iove her for that ++

01:27:16.173 --> 01:27:18.164
[Sighs]

01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:22.042
Where's your laundy?

01:27:24.582 --> 01:27:26.948
I've been here
evey day this week.

01:27:26.984 --> 01:27:29.111
All my laundy's clean.

01:27:29.153 --> 01:27:31.144
[Both laugh]

01:27:34.158 --> 01:27:36.820
I know I screwed up with you--

01:27:36.861 --> 01:27:39.352
over and over and over.

01:27:39.397 --> 01:27:42.332
It just took me a long time
to realize what I was doing.

01:27:42.366 --> 01:27:43.993
Yes, it did.

01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:51.599
I was tying to take a part
of me and make it go away.

01:27:51.642 --> 01:27:57.911
And I closed my world off, and
I put myself in a little box.

01:27:57.948 --> 01:28:00.416
And for a while,
everything seemed clear.

01:28:03.888 --> 01:28:05.685
But then you came along...

01:28:05.723 --> 01:28:09.659
and that didn't help anything.

01:28:11.128 --> 01:28:13.528
Remember when you said
that you could never tell...

01:28:13.564 --> 01:28:14.861
about someone
until you kiss them?

01:28:18.035 --> 01:28:20.367
Well...

01:28:20.404 --> 01:28:24.636
I screwed up.
I--I should've just done this.

01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:38.481
Are you done talking now?

01:29:00.244 --> 01:29:02.303
Thirty eight hours exactly.

01:29:02.346 --> 01:29:04.644
-Son of a bitch.
-Damn it.

01:29:04.682 --> 01:29:08.015
The pot's up to 140. Anybody
else want in on hour 39?

01:29:08.052 --> 01:29:09.849
DUNCAN.: Hey, hey.

01:29:09.887 --> 01:29:13.323
How do we even know that
they're stiII even in there?

01:29:13.357 --> 01:29:17.157
They could've put the CD player
on repeat or shuffle.

01:29:17.194 --> 01:29:19.958
-That's a good point.
-It is a good point...

01:29:19.997 --> 01:29:21.521
because they could've
snuck out the back window...

01:29:21.565 --> 01:29:23.556
and we're still sitting around
here like a bunch of chimps.

01:29:23.601 --> 01:29:25.967
-Chimps.
-You know what? Look at me.

01:29:26.003 --> 01:29:28.767
I've been here the whole time.
Believe it.

01:29:28.806 --> 01:29:30.706
[Music stops]

01:29:39.517 --> 01:29:40.643
[Music playing]

01:29:40.684 --> 01:29:43.710
Oh, put me in for a tenner.

01:29:43.754 --> 01:29:48.555
He'll keep going.
Two dollars, please.

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:49.718
[Door slams]

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.251
-[Chattering stops]
-Uhh.

01:30:02.973 --> 01:30:04.770
-Hey, Matt.
-What's up, Matt?

01:30:04.809 --> 01:30:05.935
Hey, Matt.

01:30:05.976 --> 01:30:08.968
All right, you guys. Come on,
get out. Get out of my house.

01:30:09.013 --> 01:30:10.480
[All chattering]

01:30:10.514 --> 01:30:12.277
No, no. You know what?

01:30:12.316 --> 01:30:13.749
Come on, come on.
Get out of my house.

01:30:13.784 --> 01:30:15.149
I'll just take this.

01:30:15.186 --> 01:30:16.949
Bye.

01:30:16.987 --> 01:30:18.545
-Later, stud.
-See you later.

01:30:18.589 --> 01:30:21.251
Thanks for the fish, Matt.

01:30:21.292 --> 01:30:23.385
Looking good. How long
are you going to be in there?

01:30:23.427 --> 01:30:24.826
-Let's go.
-Hey, I'm going.

01:30:24.862 --> 01:30:26.762
Chris, I'm going to call you
tomorrow, all right?

01:30:26.797 --> 01:30:27.957
-What are you doing?
-You, too.

01:30:27.998 --> 01:30:29.966
-I don't have my keys on me.
-Good.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.433
Wait, this is my house, dude.

01:30:31.469 --> 01:30:34.370
Not for the next
twenty four hours, it's not.

01:30:34.405 --> 01:30:37.431
And you all should be
ashamed of yourselves.

01:30:37.475 --> 01:30:39.340
You're kidding.
Don't have sex on my bed.

01:30:39.376 --> 01:30:42.607
He can't last in there
another 24 hours. He'll die.

01:30:42.646 --> 01:30:44.773
How much you want to bet?

01:30:44.815 --> 01:30:48.615
How much do I want to bet
that he'll actually die?

01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:51.314
-I'll put ten bucks on it.
-Another ten.

01:30:51.355 --> 01:30:52.686
I don't have a life.

01:30:52.923 --> 01:30:55.483
