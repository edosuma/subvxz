WEBVTT

00:00.780 --> 00:03.270
Do not try what you're about to see at home.

00:03.270 --> 00:05.520
We're what you call experts.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.780
On this episode of Mythbusters,

00:12.910 --> 00:15.610
the Hyneman and Captain Red Beard

00:16.100 --> 00:18.920
take a swing at a pirate movie myth.

00:19.210 --> 00:22.220
It is another remote control rig for making Jamie dance.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.360
Knock yourself out, buddy.

00:23.470 --> 00:26.040
Imprisoned inside a bone-cage,

00:26.050 --> 00:27.870
can you swing across a ravine...

00:27.880 --> 00:28.970
I think I'm gonna throw up.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.790
and climb to safety?

00:33.920 --> 00:37.670
Meanwhile, Kari, Tory and Grant,

00:38.410 --> 00:40.320
roll out the mythical barrel.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.550
It's a whole new meaning to "fire in the hole", doesn't it?

00:42.550 --> 00:44.030
Testing the urban legend

00:44.030 --> 00:46.770
that a drum, methanol, and a flame

00:47.610 --> 00:49.700
could send a barrel of ballistics...

00:52.080 --> 00:53.640
That thing might explode.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.210
and turn a gocart turbo.

01:01.170 --> 01:03.400
Who are the mythbusters?

01:04.209 --> 01:05.319
Adam Savage...

01:05.319 --> 01:07.420
I reject your reality and substitute my own.

01:07.420 --> 01:08.670
and Jamie Hyneman.

01:08.680 --> 01:10.230
We're gonna have an adventure.

01:10.550 --> 01:14.950
Between them, more than 30 years of special effects experience.

01:14.970 --> 01:16.800
Together with Tory Belleci...

01:16.800 --> 01:18.250
Let's torch this thing!

01:18.250 --> 01:19.650
Grant Imahara...

01:19.660 --> 01:20.750
Save yourselves.

01:20.750 --> 01:21.770
and Kari Byron.

01:21.770 --> 01:24.090
Best job ever!

01:24.520 --> 01:26.580
They don't just tell the myths,

01:27.750 --> 01:30.130
they put them to the test.

01:35.710 --> 01:40.040
First up, Adam and Jamie get savvy with a movie myth.

01:41.620 --> 01:43.480
Oh, great, pirates again.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.350
Yes, pirates.

01:44.350 --> 01:45.800
What could be the matter with that?

01:45.800 --> 01:47.200
Well, what's the story?

01:47.200 --> 01:48.650
All right, the story we are dealing this time

01:48.650 --> 01:50.100
comes from "The Pirates of The caribbean 2".

01:50.100 --> 01:52.160
There is a sequence in which our heros

01:56.090 --> 01:57.160
that's hanging in a ravine.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.910
It's quite similar to this toy, released in conjunction with the film.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.890
And anyway, they start using body weight

02:01.890 --> 02:05.070
to swing this bone cage over to the side of the cliff

02:05.070 --> 02:07.290
and catch onto it, holding onto vines.

02:07.290 --> 02:10.280
Then they're able to climb the cliff using the vines,

02:10.280 --> 02:11.720
and engineer their escape.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.860
That's what we've gotta do.

02:12.860 --> 02:15.550
You're not gonna be using that pirate voice the whole time, are you?

02:15.550 --> 02:18.440
I don't have to, but I like to,

02:18.440 --> 02:19.960
some of the time at least.

02:21.650 --> 02:23.470
By rattling their cage,

02:23.470 --> 02:26.740
this band of buccaneers swings to the cliff.

02:26.810 --> 02:29.310
But do the film-make physics check out?

02:29.400 --> 02:32.640
Could you really create enough momentum to swing high

02:32.640 --> 02:35.460
and then peg-leg it up a precipice?

02:37.510 --> 02:38.530
So what's the plan?

02:38.540 --> 02:41.540
Well, everything about this story involves the bone cage.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.420
So I think we need to start there.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.970
And it's got to be pretty strong,

02:44.970 --> 02:46.060
because in the movie,

02:46.060 --> 02:47.520
it's holding up to six people.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.730
And I think we should plan for that.

02:48.730 --> 02:50.080
And it's gotta to be really light,

02:50.080 --> 02:52.010
because we're gonna have to hall it up a cliff.

02:52.010 --> 02:54.770
Exactly, and it should look like bones.

02:54.770 --> 02:55.670
I think we can achieve that.

02:55.670 --> 02:56.970
Let's go downstairs and build it.

02:56.970 --> 02:57.850
All right.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.140
Ultimately, the mythbusters

03:00.140 --> 03:02.720
will be incarcerated inside a bone cage.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.130
Right, Jamie, I'm ready for testing.

03:06.090 --> 03:08.650
But first, they've got to create it.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.370
That is beautiful.

03:12.370 --> 03:13.400
105.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.370
Great.

03:14.900 --> 03:17.110
8 struts are bent and welded together

03:17.110 --> 03:19.710
to form a pumpkin like globe.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.480
This is our sphere, or at least it will be.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.230
You know, right now it's kind of flimsy.

03:24.230 --> 03:25.860
But by the time we're done with it,

03:25.870 --> 03:27.910
we're gonna triangulate all over the place,

03:27.910 --> 03:31.330
and it will be kind of like a organic geodesic dome,

03:31.330 --> 03:32.850
and it should be quite sturdy.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.180
Yep, the lattice work of steel support

03:35.180 --> 03:37.740
is welded into place to strengthen the ball.

03:37.930 --> 03:39.290
And although it looks simple,

03:39.290 --> 03:43.130
it's engineered to ensure that failure is not an option.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.620
We've gone with this construction method,

03:45.620 --> 03:47.180
the light-weight thin-wall steel tube

03:47.190 --> 03:48.940
and washers at every A-packs

03:48.940 --> 03:50.360
to make this thing super strong,

03:50.360 --> 03:52.870
cause we're gonna to hang six people in it.

03:52.870 --> 03:55.150
But we also want it as light as possible.

03:55.150 --> 03:57.990
We gotta try and walk it up the wall at the end.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.900
When I am the evil overlord,

03:59.900 --> 04:03.200
I will certainly keep my prisoners in something just like this.

04:03.340 --> 04:04.470
And I think we have done it.

04:04.470 --> 04:06.410
But, to make sure we are gonna hang it from the ceiling,

04:06.410 --> 04:09.240
Jamie and I are gonna get inside of it, and see how we feel.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.460
We are also going to try and swing it, and see if that is possible.

04:12.510 --> 04:14.370
Like a stink punk Cinderella,

04:14.370 --> 04:17.120
Adam needs to test out his giant pumpkin

04:17.250 --> 04:18.990
and before the pirate ball.

04:21.800 --> 04:22.930
Oh, holy crap!

04:23.950 --> 04:27.060
Haha, yeah, all right, come on in.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.470
This is a crucial proof of concept...

04:30.400 --> 04:33.160
Well, it certainly seems like it's supporting us.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.060
And it's so far so good.

04:35.060 --> 04:36.320
And back.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.380
So now, will it swing?

04:39.670 --> 04:41.010
And back.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.720
And out, it's swinging.

04:43.720 --> 04:44.790
Yeah.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.910
Hey, it's working.

04:46.130 --> 04:50.100
Surprisingly, getting the cage to move appears to be child's play.

04:50.180 --> 04:53.030
This is like my dream jungle gym when I was ten years old.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.270
But will it be this easy when they take it full scale?

04:58.290 --> 04:59.520
This isn't bad.

05:01.340 --> 05:04.190
Jamie and I have run our bone cage through enough paces.

05:04.190 --> 05:07.820
We're really confident in it from mechanical and safety standpoint.

05:07.820 --> 05:09.350
Now the only question is,

05:09.840 --> 05:11.350
it doesn't quite look like a bone cage.

05:11.350 --> 05:14.100
So, now we're gonna do a little aesthetics of it.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.310
Seems like we're spending a lot of time

05:16.310 --> 05:18.520
pulling tape off rolls these days.

05:18.530 --> 05:20.410
And been giving us some paddings,

05:20.410 --> 05:22.870
so we are not beating our heads against the steel.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.640
And once the cage is padded,

05:24.640 --> 05:26.360
it's time to bone up.

05:30.160 --> 05:34.720
The skulls and cross bones give it that cinematic, cannibalistic feel.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.010
Here, man, that tells a story.

05:37.910 --> 05:41.200
And before long, the cage is fit for a pirate.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.110
It's done?

05:42.110 --> 05:43.100
It's done.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.000
Can we get it out of here?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.060
Sure.

05:51.830 --> 05:55.080
Now, to get to the bottom of a ballistic barrel.

05:57.060 --> 05:58.580
Okay, so I've got a myth about

05:58.580 --> 06:01.650
oil drums, gocarts, and jet fuel.

06:01.650 --> 06:04.160
Gee, sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.

06:04.180 --> 06:05.170
Pretty much!

06:05.170 --> 06:07.680
Okay, this is a myth that comes from some of our European fans.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.280
Apparently this guy was watching a video

06:10.280 --> 06:11.880
about whoosh rockets on the internet.

06:11.880 --> 06:12.820
Oh yeah, those are the things

06:12.820 --> 06:15.430
where instead of using water pressure for thrust,

06:15.430 --> 06:17.140
they use jet fuel, right?

06:18.130 --> 06:21.280
Yeah. Well, this guy was watching something like you describe,

06:21.280 --> 06:23.930
but he decided he was gonna take it up a notch

06:24.070 --> 06:26.760
by using a 55 gallon oil drum,

06:26.760 --> 06:29.520
strapping it to a gocart, and adding jet fuel.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.920
And don't tell me, he jumps on, lights it,

06:32.170 --> 06:33.430
and goes for the ride of his life.

06:33.430 --> 06:34.890
At crazy speed.

06:34.890 --> 06:37.230
Well, if this works, I say we all go for a ride.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.580
Of course you do.

06:38.580 --> 06:42.170
The details of this urban myth are surprisingly precise.

06:42.270 --> 06:45.620
4 gallons of methanol inside a 55 gallon drum,

06:45.620 --> 06:46.860
plus a flame,

06:46.880 --> 06:49.700
and you'll get the rocket ride of your life.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.770
But is a break neck barrel run realistic,

06:52.770 --> 06:54.530
or is it all hot air?

06:54.540 --> 06:55.440
All right, on the surface,

06:55.450 --> 06:57.100
it sounds straightforward to test.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.650
We take a gocart, strap a 55 gallon drum to it,

06:59.650 --> 07:02.160
fill with fuel, jump on it, light it and go.

07:02.430 --> 07:04.760
Or we don't jump on it,

07:04.770 --> 07:07.150
we light it remotely, we stand really far back.

07:07.150 --> 07:08.730
Yeah, that's probably safer.

07:08.930 --> 07:12.030
It's not all that outlandish to think that someone would super size

07:12.340 --> 07:15.280
this concept into a full-sized barrel.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.330
Cause the whoosh rocket

07:16.330 --> 07:18.600
is a fairly common science demonstration.

07:18.610 --> 07:19.510
I'm gonna show you.

07:19.510 --> 07:24.670
It's your methanol, agitate, and ignite.

07:26.650 --> 07:27.440
Just like that.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.760
What happens is that

07:29.770 --> 07:32.050
you ignite the vapor inside the bottle,

07:32.050 --> 07:34.730
those expanding gases push out of the nozzle,

07:34.730 --> 07:38.400
that creates thrust and sends you right across the parking lot.

07:40.940 --> 07:42.390
But the question is,

07:42.390 --> 07:44.110
if you super size those ingredients,

07:44.110 --> 07:47.330
will you get the crazy speeds of the myth?

07:49.380 --> 07:51.020
Okay, get off, the rollers does work.

07:51.020 --> 07:51.830
This could be awesome!

07:52.170 --> 07:54.840
To get that drum rolling, it's off to location.

07:56.380 --> 07:58.930
A jet gocart with methanol.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.050
I love it!

08:01.650 --> 08:04.320
We've come out to the alameda county sheriff's bomb range,

08:04.320 --> 08:06.580
so we can test our methanol gocart,

08:08.190 --> 08:10.910
which basically requires a 55 gallon drum,

08:12.680 --> 08:13.830
So it rolls.

08:13.830 --> 08:15.150
fashioned by the gocart,

08:15.150 --> 08:19.140
and powered with four gallons of methanol, as per to the myth.

08:19.210 --> 08:22.130
I'm really curious to see if this is gonna shoot down the road

08:22.200 --> 08:24.900
or possibly just blow up into a million pieces.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.950
Don't worry, this ain't gonna hurt a bit.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.990
With a risk-taking rider strapped on,

08:29.990 --> 08:33.080
it's time to add that mythical methanol to the mix.

08:34.460 --> 08:36.240
All right. That's four gallons.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.919
Agitate it a little bit.

08:37.960 --> 08:41.350
Just like the mini whoosh rocket, the fuel needs a nudge...

08:41.419 --> 08:43.020
Looks like you have done this before.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.150
Agitate?

08:44.159 --> 08:45.090
Yes.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.160
to create a potentially explosive mix with the air.

08:49.210 --> 08:53.270
Finally, Grant fits a flare to a remote control car to trigger ignition

08:53.580 --> 08:56.370
and possibly send the barrel rocketing.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.200
All right, here we go.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.210
This is barrel gocart in 3, 2, 1.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.570
We've achieved the hole.

09:09.570 --> 09:11.020
The fire is in the hole.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.710
Doesn't looks like it is going in the hole.

09:13.710 --> 09:14.790
No ignition.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.620
Fire in the hole!

09:17.360 --> 09:18.950
I think it is in the hole, guys.

09:20.780 --> 09:21.760
Unlike the myth,

09:21.760 --> 09:23.830
the flare doesn't ignite the fuel,

09:23.830 --> 09:25.510
and the cart goes nowhere.

09:26.060 --> 09:27.930
That was anti-climactic.

09:27.930 --> 09:30.340
Anti-climactic is an understatement.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.100
Oh, the car maybe on fire.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.070
But if at first you don't succeed...

09:34.970 --> 09:36.650
Maybe the guy in the myth just got lucky.

09:36.650 --> 09:39.200
And had the right air-to-fuel ratio,

09:39.210 --> 09:41.970
so that when it did introduce the flame, it took off flying.

09:41.970 --> 09:42.890
Here you go.

09:42.890 --> 09:44.400
So, we're gonna reset this time,

09:44.400 --> 09:46.630
we're gonna agitate the barrel a little bit longer,

09:46.630 --> 09:48.950
and we're gonna put the flare inside the barrel.

09:48.950 --> 09:51.320
Gives a whole new meaning to "fire in the hole", doesn't it?

09:51.920 --> 09:54.000
Hopefully, this time we'll get enough thrust,

09:54.000 --> 09:55.550
and this thing gets fired up.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.240
In theory, more agitation should mean

09:58.240 --> 10:00.490
a more explosive mix of fuel and air.

10:00.490 --> 10:02.800
But will it get them a rocket barrel?

10:03.130 --> 10:06.680
Fire in the hole. In 3, 2, 1.

10:09.250 --> 10:10.630
There is a little bit move.

10:10.630 --> 10:13.860
It's still going! It's still going!

10:14.670 --> 10:16.330
Push the barrel out.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.990
And it actually ran up to the road a little.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.360
It's not gonna beat any land speed records.

10:22.880 --> 10:27.270
But the team has not even scraped the bottom of this ballistic barrel.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.570
You know what I would like to see now,

10:29.570 --> 10:31.270
I think we should take this to small scale,

10:31.270 --> 10:33.500
and find out if we have the perfect amount of fuel.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.540
Maybe less, maybe more.

10:34.540 --> 10:36.790
And we could actually get enough thrust to make the gocart go.

10:36.790 --> 10:37.950
All right, so back to the shop.

10:37.950 --> 10:39.160
Back to the shop!

10:39.160 --> 10:40.280
Coming up.

10:40.330 --> 10:42.790
Well, our bone cage is full of pirates!

10:42.800 --> 10:45.460
We're gonna do some scientific experiments on them.

10:47.050 --> 10:48.080
And later.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.720
This thing is going to be insane!

10:57.710 --> 10:59.460
At the end of their rope,

10:59.460 --> 11:02.610
six scurvy dogs sway themselves to freedom.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.340
But is this daring film feat a swing or a myth?

11:06.580 --> 11:09.620
To find out, Adam and Jamie have picked their bones,

11:09.620 --> 11:11.810
so now, to get them suspended.

11:11.810 --> 11:14.140
If we are gonna to test this "ball of bone" swing

11:14.140 --> 11:15.360
from "The Pirates of the Caribbean",

11:15.360 --> 11:17.070
we're gonna need a big cliff.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.500
Found one!

11:18.870 --> 11:20.070
All right, dude!

11:20.400 --> 11:22.510
I am standing in the fire training tower

11:22.510 --> 11:23.750
in the Santa Rosa fire department.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.790
This is the building they were repeatedly set on fire,

11:25.790 --> 11:27.010
and then put out.

11:27.010 --> 11:28.320
It's 75 feet tall,

11:28.320 --> 11:31.610
and it makes a perfect configurable cliff face

11:31.680 --> 11:34.290
for our swinging bone cage experiments.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.490
What's next?

11:36.560 --> 11:38.720
Well, this is about pirates, isn't it?

11:38.720 --> 11:39.630
Yeah.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.810
I don't see any pirate costume.

11:41.810 --> 11:44.610
You little faith. Give me a second.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.790
Right, Jamie, I'm ready for testing.

11:48.430 --> 11:50.150
What, no gold teeth?

11:50.610 --> 11:52.350
Oh, crap, I forgot about that part.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.460
- All right, let's get in! - Okay.

11:55.690 --> 11:57.580
What, are you gonna try your swing thing like we did in the shop

11:57.850 --> 11:59.200
with your legs dangling through?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.530
- Yeah. - All right.

12:00.530 --> 12:01.670
- Ready? - Yeah.

12:03.130 --> 12:05.250
Freshly imprisoned, the scurvy dogs

12:05.250 --> 12:07.200
try to strike up some momentum.

12:08.450 --> 12:10.130
This is without a doubt

12:10.130 --> 12:12.380
the strangest dance we've ever done.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.360
By moving back and forth,

12:14.360 --> 12:17.020
they should create enough push to get to the wall.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.820
Come on. Come on!

12:19.820 --> 12:22.100
But unlike their success in the shop,

12:22.210 --> 12:23.640
they're not budging.

12:23.640 --> 12:24.870
I have an idea.

12:24.870 --> 12:27.790
So they change tactics to the standing swing.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.220
I almost lost me hat.

12:33.310 --> 12:34.800
That would have been ugly.

12:35.180 --> 12:37.090
Grab my arm like this.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.030
Now, what if I went like this,

12:40.450 --> 12:43.100
and then you came like that, and let go over there.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.720
In theory, to get the bone cage swinging,

12:46.190 --> 12:50.130
Adam and Jamie need to raise and lower the center of gravity of the ball

12:50.420 --> 12:52.580
by using their own mass.

12:53.820 --> 12:55.000
Come on.

12:55.370 --> 12:57.210
We don't seem to be moving at all.

12:57.490 --> 12:59.680
Though we are pushing in the right direction.

12:59.730 --> 13:00.880
It's not working.

13:00.890 --> 13:02.330
However, so far,

13:02.330 --> 13:04.720
no matter how they throw their weight around,

13:04.840 --> 13:07.120
it's not enough to get a significant swing.

13:07.850 --> 13:10.650
Adam even tries thinking outside the cage.

13:10.650 --> 13:12.210
That's more promising.

13:13.010 --> 13:16.290
But cheating still doesn't get the ball rocking.

13:16.650 --> 13:18.180
I'm not sure, Jamie.

13:18.210 --> 13:20.670
We seem to have a lot more luck in the shop than we are here,

13:20.680 --> 13:22.770
and I thought it would be easier on the longer arm.

13:22.770 --> 13:25.290
Yeah, it seems like it might actually be harder.

13:25.290 --> 13:26.370
It does!

13:26.540 --> 13:29.220
And the lack of swing isn't the only problem.

13:29.660 --> 13:30.680
I think I'm gonna throw up.

13:31.830 --> 13:34.840
I am having a kind of powerful, nauseous reaction.

13:34.910 --> 13:36.830
- Why wouldn't you hop out? - Yeah.

13:36.940 --> 13:39.730
With Adam benched for ball cage duty,

13:40.550 --> 13:43.000
it is over to Jamie to swing solo.

13:44.110 --> 13:45.630
Well, Adam threw in the towel,

13:45.630 --> 13:48.120
he got a little sea sick, I guess.

13:48.590 --> 13:52.370
So, I'm gonna see if I can do anything by myself.

13:52.370 --> 13:54.870
The idea of being in it, if you removed variables,

13:54.870 --> 13:57.630
maybe you can figure out what actually makes this thing work,

13:57.920 --> 14:01.250
Adam being a variable, which he usually is.

14:01.450 --> 14:04.870
And although Jamie experiments with a variety of techniques,

14:05.690 --> 14:07.560
the problem remains the same.

14:08.510 --> 14:10.240
I don't seem to be having a lot of luck

14:10.250 --> 14:12.350
getting this thing to swing from a dead stop.

14:12.350 --> 14:15.080
But then, it weighs more than I do.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.800
So, maybe the problem is

14:16.800 --> 14:20.670
that there's not enough mass move around to dominate what it does.

14:20.800 --> 14:21.970
In the movie, after all,

14:21.970 --> 14:24.260
they had a number of people doing this.

14:24.370 --> 14:27.300
And so, maybe that's what we need to do.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.950
Maybe, because although the dimensions match the movie,

14:30.950 --> 14:32.470
their mass doesn't.

14:32.830 --> 14:33.900
What's next?

14:33.900 --> 14:35.290
Next is more bodies.

14:35.290 --> 14:39.230
More bodies. More bodies!

14:43.080 --> 14:44.520
Inspired by the internet,

14:44.520 --> 14:49.020
supposedly, this drum dare devil filled his barrel gocart with fuel,

14:49.070 --> 14:52.810
lit a match, and took off at incredible speed.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.930
But so far, getting that rocket powered rush...

14:57.990 --> 14:59.990
That's kind of anti-climactically.

15:00.170 --> 15:01.820
hasn't been that easy.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.690
So the mythbusters have come back to the shop

15:05.690 --> 15:08.600
to replicate the barrel rodeo in small scale,

15:08.600 --> 15:11.180
and test the parameters one by one.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.030
Starting with fuel.

15:14.030 --> 15:16.720
How much methanol gets optimal thrust?

15:16.720 --> 15:18.420
Let's agitate it a little bit.

15:18.420 --> 15:22.370
First off, they're trying the same ratio with the myth, 7%.

15:22.550 --> 15:23.930
Fully agitated.

15:24.130 --> 15:27.370
Here we go, in 3, 2, 1.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.440
We got some thrust.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.330
Just like the range test,

15:34.330 --> 15:36.780
7% didn't send the cart far,

15:36.820 --> 15:39.550
but will halving the fuel change that?

15:39.550 --> 15:43.450
All right, 3.5%, here we go in 3, 2, 1.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.200
We got about the same.

15:47.370 --> 15:48.650
Yeah, not much difference.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.040
3.5% gives them the same result,

15:52.040 --> 15:54.910
so they take the fuel ratio all the way down.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.310
You know, in the past when we used gases

15:58.310 --> 16:01.350
to create some sort of a thrust, like a propane rocket,

16:01.910 --> 16:05.650
we found once we got down to just fumes with just a little bit of fuel,

16:06.720 --> 16:08.290
we usually got a lot of thrust.

16:08.570 --> 16:12.770
So I expect, the less fuel we used, the more fumes,

16:12.770 --> 16:15.180
and we're actually gonna see this rocket shoot down the track.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.640
In 3, 2, 1.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.030
All right. Well, it went about two feet.

16:24.030 --> 16:25.340
So, we got some thrust.

16:25.690 --> 16:29.370
The good news is that less than 1% double the thrust,

16:29.370 --> 16:30.590
the bad news is that

16:30.590 --> 16:33.130
it was still more of a putter than a projectile.

16:33.130 --> 16:36.160
No matter what kind of air-to-fuel ratio we come up with,

16:36.160 --> 16:38.540
this thing is not rocketing like the myth talks about.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.820
I don't want to stop here.

16:39.820 --> 16:41.860
I want to see a rocket gocart.

16:41.860 --> 16:44.320
I mean, can't we make some modifications?

16:44.320 --> 16:46.010
Let's try some stuffs and see what happens.

16:46.010 --> 16:46.720
I like it!

16:46.720 --> 16:48.660
Yep, although the myth clearly states

16:48.660 --> 16:50.590
that the barrel was unmodified,

16:50.600 --> 16:52.880
to give this rocket a fighting chance,

16:52.880 --> 16:55.010
it is time to bend the rules,

16:55.010 --> 16:58.630
and bend number one is to transform the liquid fuel

16:58.630 --> 17:00.650
into that flammable fuel vapor.

17:00.650 --> 17:03.040
We're gonna try a new technique of agitating methanol

17:03.320 --> 17:04.460
using air.

17:04.460 --> 17:05.650
Now, it's gonna do two things.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.220
It's gonna introduces more oxygen

17:07.220 --> 17:09.410
and it's gonna creates more fumes.

17:09.410 --> 17:12.270
Hopefully that combination will give us more thrust.

17:12.270 --> 17:15.630
But that's not the only modification the guys have in mind.

17:16.220 --> 17:17.770
We're gonna add a nozzle.

17:17.849 --> 17:21.069
This should accelerate the escaping gases, and gives us more thrust.

17:21.369 --> 17:24.920
With a built-in agitator and thrust-focusing nozzle,

17:24.920 --> 17:27.060
will this mini barrel go ballistic?

17:27.060 --> 17:29.110
All right, here we go. Bottling up!

17:30.500 --> 17:33.670
At 5 psi.

17:35.330 --> 17:36.660
Hit it again!

17:37.430 --> 17:39.160
Yeah, that nozzle's great.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.060
It's a thrust in the right direction for the barrel.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.470
The modifications triple the distance.

17:48.670 --> 17:49.790
The only problem is

17:49.790 --> 17:52.660
after making it down the track in three blasts,

17:53.680 --> 17:55.730
it sets everything on fire.

18:00.820 --> 18:01.870
It's still going!

18:01.870 --> 18:03.160
Oh, no!

18:03.810 --> 18:07.820
Luckily, the safety officer is on hand to diffuse the situation.

18:08.190 --> 18:10.130
Well, that was exciting.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.880
That thing could have kept going

18:13.880 --> 18:17.580
if the track hadn't caught on fire and everything got really dangerous.

18:17.580 --> 18:20.390
Dangerous? Yes, but also a good start.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.230
So, now the team can focus on

18:22.230 --> 18:24.990
making their model safer and more efficient.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.660
Now, my theory is that we're losing a lot of energy

18:27.660 --> 18:30.610
as expanding gases have to turn this tight corner,

18:30.620 --> 18:32.350
and then come out of the nozzle.

18:32.350 --> 18:35.390
So, what I'm gonna try is to make a funnel shape,

18:35.390 --> 18:37.250
and relocate the bung hole to the center,

18:37.250 --> 18:41.130
that way the gases can expand smoothly, accelerate,

18:41.130 --> 18:43.650
and then come out the nozzle with even more thrust.

18:43.650 --> 18:46.750
And while Grant is working on a more efficient nozzle,

18:46.750 --> 18:50.260
Tory is injecting some oomph into the fuel injection.

18:50.260 --> 18:53.150
And this is what's gonna be going on inside the barrel.

18:53.790 --> 18:56.540
Now, originally we had the fuel in the bottom of the barrel,

18:56.540 --> 18:58.990
and we pumped air through it, creating vapors.

18:59.030 --> 19:00.640
But I thought it would be kinda cool

19:00.640 --> 19:04.400
if we introduced the fuel through an auto-body-spray gun.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.650
That way, we're getting air,

19:05.650 --> 19:09.630
and we're automizing the methnol, making it much easier to ignite.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.540
After optimizing the design,

19:11.600 --> 19:14.460
the barrel gocart is rolled out once again.

19:16.510 --> 19:20.360
This is longer nozzle with aerated fuel, and cone.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.060
Here we go, in 3, 2, 1.

19:27.970 --> 19:31.650
Amazingly, the combination of nozzle and aerated fuel

19:31.650 --> 19:34.780
propels that barrel 15 feet down the track.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.260
We got some serious distance.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.290
I think it is time we take this full scale.

19:39.350 --> 19:41.580
Yeah, I think that is the winning combo.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.410
I've got the long nozzle,

19:43.410 --> 19:45.960
the aeration, the crazy cone shape,

19:45.960 --> 19:47.860
this is gonna be so cool when we're on large scale.

19:47.860 --> 19:48.950
I think it's gonna work.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.840
How we're gonna to stop it, that's the question.

19:51.960 --> 19:55.540
After a lot of testing and several new improvements,

19:55.540 --> 19:57.730
we have gone from the simple barrel gocart

19:57.730 --> 20:00.340
to this crazy thing here.

20:00.340 --> 20:01.750
We actually added a nozzle,

20:01.750 --> 20:04.930
a cone shape and an aeration system for the fuel,

20:04.930 --> 20:07.520
so that we could propel this little dude down the track,

20:07.610 --> 20:10.460
15 times the length of our gocart.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.000
I think when we take this to full scale,

20:12.000 --> 20:15.220
we've got a really good chance at some really sick thrust.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:26.320 --> 20:27.360
Swinging.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.910
It is so easy, even a dog can do it.

20:30.510 --> 20:31.500
Come on.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.420
But that's not the case for our scurvy dogs.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.330
I think I'm gonna throw up.

20:36.550 --> 20:38.100
Which is why the mythbusters

20:38.100 --> 20:40.550
have drafted some help into service.

20:41.520 --> 20:44.520
Well, we just assembled a new crew

20:44.520 --> 20:47.190
to escape from the bone cage.

20:47.330 --> 20:51.710
They've got over 53 years of circus experience.

20:51.710 --> 20:55.660
Among them, the live, the limber, the scurvy dogs

20:55.660 --> 20:58.020
and they're ready to help us get swinging.

20:58.020 --> 21:00.890
Earlier, Adam and Jamie were a few mate short

21:00.890 --> 21:02.650
of a 34 foot swing.

21:02.650 --> 21:04.610
Come on up and try to exercise.

21:04.610 --> 21:08.610
But now with four trapeze professionals and two mythbusters,

21:08.610 --> 21:11.750
they've got the six man crew of the film.

21:11.750 --> 21:14.440
The pirate potsy start with the movie method.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.120
- You all right? - Yep, I've got knee pads.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.280
But that technique doesn't seem to have legs.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.010
- You OK? - Yep.

21:24.010 --> 21:25.120
All right.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.870
One more time, let's go back.

21:29.260 --> 21:31.810
All right, so the movie technique of running side to side is

21:31.810 --> 21:33.320
totally not working here.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.840
First of all, we can't do it within unison,

21:35.840 --> 21:37.540
and we keep falling through the holes.

21:37.540 --> 21:40.490
So it's not very safe and not very effective.

21:40.650 --> 21:43.320
But we do know in order to get this thing moving,

21:43.330 --> 21:46.890
we need to concentrate our efforts on changing the center of mass,

21:46.890 --> 21:48.180
like a kid on a swing.

21:48.180 --> 21:50.640
We need to raise the center on the up swing,

21:50.640 --> 21:52.630
and lower on the down swing.

21:52.630 --> 21:56.000
That way we might be able to build the momentum we need,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.850
to get the distance we want.

21:58.170 --> 22:01.020
Yep, and to get to grips with that center of mass,

22:01.020 --> 22:02.770
they enlist a tie strap,

22:02.870 --> 22:03.710
Push.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.130
creating a coordinated rhythm

22:07.130 --> 22:09.320
either side of the center of gravity

22:10.530 --> 22:12.580
that seems to get them swinging.

22:14.030 --> 22:16.620
Will this work out ever?

22:16.620 --> 22:18.310
Bend your knees. Push.

22:18.650 --> 22:21.830
But after over 40 minutes of the old heave ho,

22:21.830 --> 22:24.300
they're nowhere near the cliff.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.900
At this point, we have had some success

22:25.900 --> 22:27.720
but eventually we lose the battle.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.070
The cable and sphere seem to be

22:30.160 --> 22:32.720
absorbing all of our energy into

22:32.720 --> 22:35.310
flexing and twisting and bobbing around

22:35.310 --> 22:37.750
instead of letting us focus it

22:37.750 --> 22:40.600
in one specific direction for the swing.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.320
So the only thing that we can think of to do is

22:43.320 --> 22:44.700
to shorten the cable.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.870
Hopefully that gets us where we want to go.

22:46.910 --> 22:48.870
Shortening the cable makes the change to

22:48.870 --> 22:52.120
center of gravity, in comparison to the length, larger,

22:52.120 --> 22:54.080
and should amplify the swing.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.890
But will it be enough?

22:55.890 --> 22:58.000
We've shortened the cable and see if it swings.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.260
Push it. Push it.

23:00.370 --> 23:03.890
Initially, it seems that building up power is easier.

23:04.060 --> 23:04.840
Push!

23:04.840 --> 23:06.690
Oh it seems to be working.

23:06.690 --> 23:07.720
Yeah.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.430
That's it, you scurvy dogs. Sway.

23:11.430 --> 23:12.440
Bend.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.750
But after another hour of effort,

23:14.760 --> 23:16.950
it's clear that they're sustaining

23:16.950 --> 23:19.370
rather than gaining momentum.

23:19.840 --> 23:20.440
Getting any higher?

23:20.440 --> 23:21.740
Never.

23:22.510 --> 23:24.320
Guys, that was a fantastic effort.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.720
I feel like we're just not gonna get that thing swinging.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.530
So it's just not your average trapeze swing.

23:28.530 --> 23:31.550
With this big heavy cage, to try to move it, it's just not possible.

23:31.550 --> 23:33.670
Yeah, it's not gonna get any lighter than that.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.210
Now, if we can't make it work with these guys,

23:35.210 --> 23:37.030
we can't make it work.

23:37.030 --> 23:38.900
Think it's safe to say that swinging a bone cage

23:38.900 --> 23:41.230
with six people from inside, busted.

23:41.260 --> 23:42.570
It's busted.

23:43.940 --> 23:48.590
Busted, but there's still more pirate pandemonium to come.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.930
Everyone knows things are better when they're turbo charged.

24:00.090 --> 24:03.780
But the Mythbusters' first ballistic barrel was anything but.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.760
And nothing is happening.

24:07.210 --> 24:10.300
However, after a few small scale modifications,

24:11.500 --> 24:13.160
they've upped the thrust

24:13.790 --> 24:16.240
and they're ready to take this myth full scale.

24:17.340 --> 24:19.590
So now with modifications in small scale,

24:19.590 --> 24:22.800
we've gotten the gocart to rocket across the shop.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.680
But our design has evolved,

24:24.680 --> 24:28.370
from a woosh rocket into what's called a pulse jet.

24:28.490 --> 24:31.600
We know that a woosh rocket ignites fuel in a chamber

24:31.600 --> 24:33.830
and gas expanding creates thrust.

24:33.830 --> 24:36.670
But after one big burst, it is pretty much over.

24:37.150 --> 24:38.590
The difference with the pulse jet is that

24:38.590 --> 24:40.940
the thrust is continuous.

24:41.060 --> 24:44.720
The escaping gases create an air of low pressure in the chamber,

24:44.800 --> 24:49.030
air's that sucked in to fill the gap, start the bashing again.

24:49.030 --> 24:52.790
So that the cycle of thrust will repeat as long as there's fuel,

24:52.850 --> 24:54.240
and a source of ignition.

24:54.520 --> 24:58.020
Indeed, but to supersize their pulse jet gocart

24:58.020 --> 25:01.640
there's a lot to do, starting with portable fuel injection.

25:01.640 --> 25:04.880
Now for this to work, we need constant air entering the barrel.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.830
So, to make it portable,

25:07.390 --> 25:09.100
I am gonna use a scuba tank.

25:09.100 --> 25:12.100
The air pressure comming out of here is 3000PSI.

25:12.110 --> 25:14.110
I need to get it down to 100 psi,

25:14.120 --> 25:17.280
so it actually pumps fuel through our spray gun.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.910
So what I'm gonna do is take this old regulator,

25:20.480 --> 25:21.990
put it to this regulator,

25:21.990 --> 25:24.410
and hopefully get it down to a safe enough pressure,

25:24.420 --> 25:26.470
so we get the fuel injection into the barrel

25:26.470 --> 25:28.150
and this thing gets fired up.

25:28.150 --> 25:30.680
We're about to go diving into science!

25:32.420 --> 25:34.210
Come along for the journey!

25:37.210 --> 25:38.490
We have portable air.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.120
With the fuel injection invention sorted,

25:41.530 --> 25:43.880
Kari gets on a roll with the gocart.

25:44.680 --> 25:45.760
I'm designing the cart.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.210
Now I want this to roll really really easily so that

25:48.210 --> 25:50.630
all the thrust can make it shoot down the runway.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.990
To do that, I'm going to use tires from a bicycle.

25:53.990 --> 25:55.700
I figure that has a low rolling resistance,

25:55.700 --> 25:57.820
it will be a lot easier to just push it.

25:58.780 --> 26:00.410
Now I also want to make the cart really light weight,

26:00.420 --> 26:02.380
So I'm going to use a minimal amount of material

26:02.390 --> 26:03.740
to try to create a cart that

26:03.740 --> 26:07.100
actually will have no problem turning into a rocket.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.140
Kari streamlined the design,

26:09.140 --> 26:11.890
but the main element of turning the gocart rocket

26:11.890 --> 26:13.420
is the back end.

26:13.660 --> 26:14.870
Now given the success of the cone

26:14.870 --> 26:16.720
and the long nozzle in small scale,

26:16.720 --> 26:20.170
we're gonna do exactly the same thing in large scale.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.090
Looks like a donut now,

26:22.090 --> 26:23.880
but soon it will be a cone.

26:24.190 --> 26:26.350
And while Grant gets bent out of shape,

26:27.850 --> 26:29.510
Tory creates the nozzle.

26:30.310 --> 26:32.060
That's one big nozzle.

26:33.030 --> 26:36.210
With the nozzle and cone complete and the barrel on board,

26:36.220 --> 26:38.680
Kari decides to add a little personality.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.550
Demon doll.

26:48.870 --> 26:50.220
Drum roll please.

26:51.630 --> 26:53.740
Meet the rolling drum rocket,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.380
or the Mythbusters' pulse jet gocart.

26:57.530 --> 26:59.800
Oh, my god. That is insanity.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.210
You know one thing we forgot?

27:01.560 --> 27:02.420
Brakes.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.670
Where we're going, we don't need brakes.

27:04.810 --> 27:06.520
Coming up on Mythbusters.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.370
Can you make a gocart out of a barrel?

27:08.370 --> 27:09.810
You not gonna wanna miss this.

27:15.870 --> 27:17.630
At Alameda, the team's arrived

27:17.630 --> 27:20.500
lock, stock, and pulse jet barrel.

27:20.670 --> 27:21.780
You know after that first test,

27:21.780 --> 27:23.530
I really didn't think this had much promise.

27:23.530 --> 27:26.340
But after building this thing, I cannot wait to see what it does.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.710
Come on. This is Mythbusters.

27:27.710 --> 27:29.030
You knew how this is gonna end.

27:29.030 --> 27:31.960
It's either gonna explode or it's gonna zoom down the runway.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.180
That's the plan, the team is feeling optimistic.

27:35.180 --> 27:37.010
After going through our small scale test,

27:37.010 --> 27:39.810
coming up with modifications to give more thrust

27:39.810 --> 27:41.440
and then finally getting to this stage,

27:41.510 --> 27:43.210
where we have this crazy vehicle,

27:43.210 --> 27:47.050
I think we have a very good chance of replicating the results today.

27:47.050 --> 27:50.660
Just like last time, the cart gets an uneasy rider.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.650
Those eyes are creeping me out.

27:53.060 --> 27:54.610
I'm gonna make him look more scary.

27:57.660 --> 27:58.910
Nice touch.

27:59.250 --> 28:01.630
That's perfect, cause it wasn't weird enough.

28:02.770 --> 28:05.890
With the rider on board and fuel fueled.

28:06.650 --> 28:07.920
All right, let's light them up.

28:08.010 --> 28:11.360
Tory takes care of their sophisticated ignition system.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.060
Run.

28:12.140 --> 28:14.640
Lighting the blow torch and running for it.

28:14.940 --> 28:15.610
Yeah!

28:15.610 --> 28:17.740
- Here we go, in 3, 2, 1. - Fire.

28:21.970 --> 28:23.270
Hey, we got some thrust.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.140
Look at that!

28:24.140 --> 28:26.390
Yeah, it's working.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.220
Do you think it will just keep adding speed and adding speed.

28:30.220 --> 28:31.610
It's starting to pick up speed.

28:31.610 --> 28:33.430
Come on!

28:35.300 --> 28:37.260
All right, it is not the fastest vehicle in the world,

28:37.260 --> 28:38.980
- but it's working. - That's not bad.

28:38.990 --> 28:41.350
It's getting you down the runway.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.070
The pulse jet is pulsing

28:45.070 --> 28:47.840
but it is not the maximum thrust they hoped for.

28:47.840 --> 28:48.660
I don't know about you,

28:48.660 --> 28:50.650
but I wouldn't traded my car for this.

28:50.650 --> 28:53.900
We are just not getting the thrust that we expected.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.600
If you look at the initial pulse,

28:55.650 --> 28:58.750
you'll see it's not like a "waa", it's like a "poof".

28:59.430 --> 29:00.990
Now what we think is happening is that

29:00.990 --> 29:03.030
somethings just don't scale up.

29:03.030 --> 29:05.410
This large diameter nozzle and this cone,

29:05.410 --> 29:07.900
they're in scale with the small scale,

29:07.900 --> 29:10.560
but when we moved up to the bigger barrel,

29:10.560 --> 29:13.610
we didn't necessarily get a bigger explosion.

29:13.610 --> 29:16.940
And so we think some of that energy is being lost

29:16.940 --> 29:20.350
in this large diameter, it's allowing too much gas to escape.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.250
So what we need to do is go back to the shop,

29:22.250 --> 29:26.240
cut this off, and put a smaller diameter nozzle on it.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.190
and see if that hold more gas in,

29:28.190 --> 29:29.900
and from that, we'll get more thrust.

29:29.900 --> 29:34.060
The Mythbusters have the technology and quick as a flash.

29:34.060 --> 29:36.480
Bang, just like that.

29:36.540 --> 29:38.300
They have rebuilt it.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.650
Back at the runway, the question is,

29:41.650 --> 29:45.230
will the smaller nozzle on the pulse jet get it rocketing?

29:46.070 --> 29:47.260
Fire in the hole.

29:50.340 --> 29:54.060
Here we go, 3, 2, 1.

29:54.110 --> 29:55.670
Ignition.

29:57.110 --> 29:59.090
- Oh we already got some movement. - All right.

29:59.150 --> 30:00.320
A lot better than before, I like it.

30:00.800 --> 30:04.890
It's a good sign, and it is more thrust than previous tests.

30:08.510 --> 30:10.130
But only marginally.

30:10.130 --> 30:13.310
- That is hysterical. - Adorable.

30:13.430 --> 30:15.060
It is adorable really.

30:15.210 --> 30:18.850
Look out, people, it's coming through.

30:18.850 --> 30:21.700
I was worried how we were gonna stop it.

30:21.960 --> 30:25.010
After the slowest fence collision on record,

30:25.630 --> 30:27.400
the cart is spent.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.010
-That was hilarious! - That was funny.

30:31.950 --> 30:34.650
We gave this the best possible chance of working.

30:34.650 --> 30:38.600
We added a fuel injection system, low rolling resistance tires,

30:38.600 --> 30:42.200
continuous triggering, and still, with all of that,

30:42.200 --> 30:45.120
we couldn't go very far or very fast.

30:45.120 --> 30:47.480
This one is well and truly busted.

30:48.390 --> 30:50.980
Their pulse jet barrel may be busted,

30:50.980 --> 30:52.930
but as Kari said earlier.

30:52.940 --> 30:54.180
It is either gonna explode

30:54.180 --> 30:55.870
or it is gonna zoom down the runway.

30:56.700 --> 31:00.370
There are only two ways this myth can truly end.

31:03.530 --> 31:04.590
After the break,

31:04.590 --> 31:07.430
can six dirty seamen swing and escape?

31:07.430 --> 31:10.540
This is dangerous jungle gym antics for adults.

31:12.760 --> 31:16.580
Please do not try what you are about to see at home.

31:16.590 --> 31:18.130
We're what you call experts.

31:18.130 --> 31:19.240
Can't you tell?

31:22.890 --> 31:24.780
We have thoroughly tested

31:25.060 --> 31:26.940
the first part of the story which is the swinging,

31:26.990 --> 31:29.870
and we came up totally busted.

31:30.950 --> 31:33.170
You can't get six people in here

31:33.170 --> 31:35.750
and get them to move it, it is just not possible.

31:35.750 --> 31:38.030
But there's a second and third part to the story.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.620
And that's where we're going now.

31:40.180 --> 31:42.420
Yep, there still the cling and climb.

31:42.420 --> 31:45.100
If they make like pirates and cheat swing,

31:45.150 --> 31:47.630
can they cart the cage up the cliff?

31:48.630 --> 31:51.630
First, they need something to get a grip on.

31:53.210 --> 31:54.330
Are you happy with it?

31:54.810 --> 31:55.810
Yeah, we're done.

31:56.420 --> 32:00.430
This crash mat rigging combo will stand in for the movie vines.

32:01.350 --> 32:04.710
There it is, a skull fit for a pirate.

32:04.730 --> 32:07.440
Topped off with a flag fit for capture,

32:07.440 --> 32:10.040
they're ready to get all hands on deck.

32:10.410 --> 32:11.340
All right, lads.

32:11.340 --> 32:12.960
It is time to get swinging.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.840
Now, to be correct to the movie,

32:14.850 --> 32:18.640
we reextended our cables to be 80 feet long.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.530
The building behind me is a cliff.

32:21.530 --> 32:24.170
The netting is the vines.

32:24.580 --> 32:27.600
We're gonna get in our ball and start it swinging.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.910
Inside the ball, it's still the same six savvy seamen.

32:30.910 --> 32:32.000
But more importantly,

32:32.000 --> 32:35.660
this time they're getting a lift from some land lubbing muscle.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.060
- Wholly crap. - Here we go.

32:42.060 --> 32:46.380
And 3, 2, 1, go!

32:51.950 --> 32:54.580
Rather than risk a full speed cliff collision,

32:54.580 --> 32:56.930
the tug squad start the swing gently.

32:56.930 --> 32:57.870
This is fun.

32:57.870 --> 32:58.890
This is really fun.

32:58.890 --> 33:01.900
This is dangerous jungle gym antics for adults.

33:02.310 --> 33:03.840
All right, maggots.

33:03.980 --> 33:06.430
Let's swing toward that wall.

33:06.430 --> 33:08.490
3, 2, 1, go!

33:14.280 --> 33:17.700
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

33:17.750 --> 33:22.270
And finding that sweet swing spot takes brains and brawn.

33:24.900 --> 33:27.460
Well this swing testing was exactly what I wanted to see.

33:27.460 --> 33:30.870
Because the fact that it is taking four strong guys

33:30.970 --> 33:33.850
with all their strength to pull us back means

33:34.210 --> 33:37.090
that's about what it's gonna take to hold on to the rope

33:37.090 --> 33:38.680
when we get to the other side.

33:39.130 --> 33:41.310
But with a little more heave ho,

33:41.310 --> 33:44.170
the muscle manages to give them the swing they need.

33:52.770 --> 33:54.170
We got it.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.610
Give yourselves a round of applause.

33:56.820 --> 33:58.910
Wait, no, you can't! All right,

33:58.910 --> 34:03.350
let it go on the count of 3, 2, 1!

34:03.350 --> 34:04.340
Let go!

34:07.530 --> 34:09.699
It is an arrgh-ha moment.

34:10.030 --> 34:12.230
A round of applause for the pirates.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.230
To the crew's surprise,

34:14.230 --> 34:17.060
hanging on wasn't as difficult as expected.

34:20.230 --> 34:22.860
So we were successful swinging up to the wall and holding on,

34:22.860 --> 34:24.750
and it requires quite a bit of strength,

34:24.750 --> 34:27.750
but at least we aren't having to support our own weight

34:27.750 --> 34:28.790
and the weight of the ball.

34:28.790 --> 34:32.179
We're simply restricting ourselves from swinging back.

34:32.340 --> 34:34.530
When we start to have to climb the wall,

34:34.610 --> 34:36.639
that's when we're gonna have to pull out this weight up

34:36.690 --> 34:39.159
and that's gonna be a different story.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.889
Personally, I don't think

34:40.889 --> 34:42.360
we're gonna be able to do it.

34:42.409 --> 34:44.420
Well, now to put it all together.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.030
Right, crew, are you ready?

34:47.659 --> 34:49.659
They'll swing, they'll cling,

34:49.659 --> 34:51.389
and attempt to capture the flag.

34:51.389 --> 34:54.290
In 3, 2, 1, go!

35:02.640 --> 35:05.260
Yes, I've grabbed.

35:05.390 --> 35:06.230
Now.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.680
Try to climb.

35:07.750 --> 35:11.050
With the crew clinging on harder than star-trek extras,

35:11.050 --> 35:12.550
the climb commences.

35:15.470 --> 35:18.950
It's hand over hand as everyone pulls their weight.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.470
We're going up!

35:20.960 --> 35:22.180
It's working!

35:22.180 --> 35:24.610
And to both Mythbusters' surprise,

35:24.610 --> 35:27.280
the 1500 pound cage ascends.

35:27.790 --> 35:29.030
It's working!

35:29.030 --> 35:32.610
And the ball climbs first one story and then two.

35:32.980 --> 35:35.040
Grab the flag!

35:41.860 --> 35:44.760
After climbing a vertical 12 feet,

35:44.760 --> 35:45.830
victory is theirs.

35:46.080 --> 35:49.010
In 3, 2, 1, let go.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.360
Nice work!

35:54.410 --> 35:55.420
How about that.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.410
We were totally able to climb!

35:58.100 --> 35:59.770
I love being wrong!

36:00.860 --> 36:04.320
Indeed, because you can't argue with that success.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.130
So I grabbed the vine I'm holding on to,

36:06.130 --> 36:07.460
which is a vertical rope.

36:07.470 --> 36:09.040
And I still am thinking at this point,

36:09.040 --> 36:11.110
there's no way in hell this is going to work.

36:11.110 --> 36:13.920
And then I start to be able to pull on some rope,

36:13.920 --> 36:15.620
and I noticed that everybody else is pulling, too.

36:15.620 --> 36:17.110
And all of a sudden we are climbing,

36:17.110 --> 36:18.900
one foot, two feet, three feet,

36:18.900 --> 36:22.590
and I look up and the Jolly Roger here is within our grasp,

36:22.590 --> 36:23.950
and it was a success.

36:24.030 --> 36:26.520
And after all the efforts of their muscly crew,

36:26.520 --> 36:28.430
where does that leave the myth?

36:28.430 --> 36:31.490
Swinging a bone cage under your own power from inside.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.140
Busted.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.590
Catching on the vines on the side of the ravine

36:34.600 --> 36:36.110
once you swung over to it.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.070
Plausible.

36:37.070 --> 36:40.790
And climbing out of that ravine once you caught on to those vines.

36:40.790 --> 36:42.390
Surprisingly plausible.

36:42.390 --> 36:43.460
Who would have thought.

36:45.780 --> 36:48.810
Next, does this noise mean

36:48.810 --> 36:51.840
"Make or Break" for the ballistic barrel?

36:58.660 --> 37:01.050
On a runway in San Joaquin County,

37:01.050 --> 37:04.200
the barrel gocart myth is about to go ballistic.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.260
We're at the New Jerusalem airport runway.

37:06.260 --> 37:07.090
Why?

37:07.090 --> 37:09.700
Because we're Mythbusters, and we're not going to be satisfied

37:09.860 --> 37:12.570
with that 5 mile per hour run we saw with our barrel rocket.

37:12.570 --> 37:15.680
And that's being generous, we wanna see something impressive.

37:18.150 --> 37:20.170
And that is where Bob Maddox comes in.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.130
Absolutly, because if Bob's propulsive prowess

37:23.130 --> 37:25.600
can make a push bike jet propelled,

37:25.600 --> 37:27.760
imagine what he can do with a barrel.

37:28.250 --> 37:32.120
This thing is going to be insane.

37:33.010 --> 37:34.990
Bob is one of the few people in the world

37:34.990 --> 37:38.320
with the job title professional pulse jet builder.

37:38.360 --> 37:42.030
He's been designing and buildings these jets for over 20 years.

37:42.130 --> 37:45.970
He's taken our barrel rocket design and highly modified it.

37:45.970 --> 37:47.680
It may look the same on the outside,

37:47.690 --> 37:50.170
but inside, it is completely different,

37:50.290 --> 37:52.360
and it's gonna be totally bad ass.

37:52.650 --> 37:56.170
But just what exactly are these bad ass modifications?

37:56.530 --> 37:58.960
Now tell us what some of the differences are

37:58.960 --> 38:00.920
between ours and yours.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.390
Well, the difference is mostly is

38:02.390 --> 38:04.480
we have a one way reed valve in the front.

38:04.480 --> 38:05.860
When the explosion goes off,

38:05.860 --> 38:08.240
it makes the gases go out the tail,

38:08.280 --> 38:10.010
and won't go out the front.

38:10.010 --> 38:13.310
The one way valve focuses the thrust more efficiently,

38:13.310 --> 38:14.890
but the major change is that

38:14.890 --> 38:18.340
this pulse jet pulses at heart stopping speed.

38:18.340 --> 38:21.400
That happens 70 or 80 times a second inside this one,

38:21.490 --> 38:24.880
where yours was only once every four or five seconds or whatever.

38:24.880 --> 38:25.990
Let's see if yours

38:25.990 --> 38:28.800
will match our wapping 5 miles an hour speed.

38:29.760 --> 38:33.300
Bob's about to fire up the barrel rocket cart for the first time.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.280
Now it's going to be tethered, we're gonna turn it on,

38:35.280 --> 38:37.210
just to make sure everything's working.

38:37.220 --> 38:39.280
All right, Bob fire it up.

38:39.280 --> 38:41.690
All right let see if we can tear up this runway.

38:42.060 --> 38:44.680
It is an important tethered system's check.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.570
Because of the subtitles made clear,

38:54.110 --> 38:58.440
70 pulses a second is a lot more powerful than expected.

39:01.250 --> 39:02.460
It is a little bit louder,

39:02.460 --> 39:04.590
maybe a little more powerful than ours.

39:04.590 --> 39:06.330
That's scary. That's a little scary.

39:06.330 --> 39:08.480
Maybe we should have some safety precautions

39:08.480 --> 39:11.330
to keep this thing from flying off into who knows where.

39:11.330 --> 39:13.210
Maybe we should cable it down.

39:13.210 --> 39:14.760
It's awesome.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.670
Now we know Bob can build a pulse jet engine,

39:18.690 --> 39:21.210
but he has never attached it to a gocart

39:21.210 --> 39:24.090
made out of a barrel and four bicycle wheels.

39:24.090 --> 39:25.680
So we have no idea what's gonna happen.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.290
I mean this thing could explode,

39:27.290 --> 39:29.050
it could go flying out of control.

39:29.060 --> 39:31.730
We have taken some extra safety precautions

39:31.780 --> 39:33.540
to make sure nothing bad happens.

39:33.550 --> 39:35.100
One, we have a steel belted cable

39:35.100 --> 39:37.830
that will be running down the length of our runway,

39:37.830 --> 39:40.080
so our cart stays on track.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.830
We also added a kill switch,

39:41.830 --> 39:43.390
so if it does fly out of control,

39:43.400 --> 39:45.910
we can shut it down whenever we want.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.420
At the end of the runway, we have k-rail set up,

39:48.480 --> 39:49.880
so that if it does get out of control,

39:49.880 --> 39:51.790
it has a barrier to crash into.

39:51.800 --> 39:54.840
We will bebined the blast sheild while this all takes place.

39:54.840 --> 39:56.860
This is gonna be awesome, but most importantly,

39:56.860 --> 39:58.440
it's gonna be safe.

39:58.850 --> 40:00.940
4,000 feet of cable.

40:00.990 --> 40:03.060
That should keep our cart in line.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.030
It should.

40:04.030 --> 40:05.550
But the pulse jet gocart

40:05.550 --> 40:07.490
won't be the only thing on the line.

40:07.500 --> 40:10.460
There's also their previous record.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.500
We're going to have to

40:13.510 --> 40:15.080
surpass the record here

40:15.080 --> 40:16.990
of the last barrel rocket,

40:17.050 --> 40:19.020
5 miles an hour.

40:19.020 --> 40:20.730
So for this to be impressive,

40:20.740 --> 40:22.670
I wanna see highway speeds.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.970
Now Bob has been perfecting his engine for years.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.870
Now we had three days to build ours,

40:27.870 --> 40:30.170
and we're able to get it to go with 5 miles an hour.

40:30.200 --> 40:33.300
I'm hoping his can go faster than ours.

40:33.390 --> 40:34.520
I'm pretty sure it will.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.520
Let's go.

40:35.680 --> 40:36.930
Ok, I'm gonna measure the speed,

40:36.930 --> 40:38.860
cause I have a feeling he's flying.

40:39.630 --> 40:40.510
All right.

40:40.510 --> 40:42.780
The team retires to a safe distance.

40:42.780 --> 40:45.420
And it's over to Bob to initiate launch.

40:49.550 --> 40:51.270
And run for his life.

40:51.810 --> 40:53.130
All right, this is pulse jet

40:53.130 --> 40:55.110
barrel rocket on steroids.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.300
Here we go in 3, 2, 1.

40:58.640 --> 41:01.040
Then the barrel is unleashed.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.160
There it goes!

41:05.160 --> 41:08.340
And it thunders down the runway at speed.

41:09.310 --> 41:10.640
Yes!

41:12.380 --> 41:13.860
50 mile per hour.

41:13.860 --> 41:15.420
Dude, that was awesome!

41:15.420 --> 41:18.030
You know what, this myth is still busted.

41:18.030 --> 41:21.460
I mean look what we had to resort to to make this work.

41:21.460 --> 41:22.840
A professional!

41:23.290 --> 41:25.040
Bob, that was awesome.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.090
Nice work.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.360
Finally, after a string of failures,

41:31.360 --> 41:34.230
the Mythbusters have gotten their happy ending.

41:35.980 --> 41:40.180
The cart jetted a mile down the runway at super speed.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.340
The thing you don't get,

41:42.470 --> 41:45.290
and you probably not gonna get to experience this in full at home,

41:45.490 --> 41:47.840
is the sound this thing makes!

41:47.840 --> 41:51.040
It's like "Moooooooooooooo".

41:55.360 --> 41:56.290
Finally we got it to work.

41:56.290 --> 41:58.390
We got our barrel jet to go down

41:58.390 --> 42:00.620
the runway at 50 miles an hour.

42:00.740 --> 42:02.820
Ok, so we had to bring in an expert

42:02.820 --> 42:05.020
with a completely different jet engine.

42:05.020 --> 42:07.190
But still, we got a barrel

42:07.190 --> 42:08.790
with a guy on it going down the runway

42:08.800 --> 42:10.370
at 50 miles an hour.

42:10.370 --> 42:12.580
This is still busted, but it's pretty asoweme.
