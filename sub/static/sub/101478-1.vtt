Remember,
we have the German case management meeting in the morning.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.192
- We'll be back in time.
- Good.

02:47.535 --> 02:48.734
Nervous flyer?

02:48.736 --> 02:51.937
Yes, Sir, a bit.

02:53.407 --> 02:57.876
Quite an honor.
You need to fly in the corporate jet your first week on the job.

02:57.878 --> 03:01.380
I've been here
eight weeks, Sir.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.648
Excuse me?

03:02.650 --> 03:04.716
Been here two months.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.553
But thank you.
Name's Keisha...

03:07.555 --> 03:11.657
James.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.726
<i>...clear to take off.</i>

03:21.468 --> 03:22.935
Relax, Miss James.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.638
This plan is courtesy
of Cal Air. Our largest client,

03:26.640 --> 03:27.839
39 percent of our billables.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.743
Okay.

03:40.521 --> 03:43.755
Judge, if you grant their motion,
Cal Air will have completely destroyed

03:43.757 --> 03:46.725
a mom-and-pop company
that has been flying families

03:46.727 --> 03:49.228
over Lake Michigan
for 30 years.

03:49.230 --> 03:53.298
- This isn't equitable or fair.
- This isn't about equity, Your Honor.

03:53.934 --> 03:57.669
- Well, I notice you left out the word "fair."
- In this case the law states--

03:57.671 --> 03:59.871
I mean, you have already
decided the case.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.610
I'm sorry, Mr. Counselor,
but the court has no choice

04:05.679 --> 04:07.613
but to follow the law.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.551
Next case,
the State of Illinois versus Jamal Randolph.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.522
Mr. Randolph.

04:18.626 --> 04:21.426
This is the fifth time
I've seen you this year.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.328
I see you more
than I see my grandchildren.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.731
And that is a problem.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.867
This time
it's two OxyContin pills

04:28.869 --> 04:30.902
that you gave to your...
your fellow inmates.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.505
Yeah, my boy was hurting
and he had these shakes.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.308
Mr. Randolph,
you have three weeks remaining

04:36.310 --> 04:39.011
on your present sentence.
I'm gonna tack on an additional week.

04:39.013 --> 04:40.579
Man, this is
some fucking bullshit.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.880
Mr. Randolph,

04:43.484 --> 04:46.518
you're on your way out.
You stay out of trouble.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.523
Mr. Randolph,
re... re... return here.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.425
Return here
back to the podium.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.632
You have another case in here
in this court, a civil case,

05:00.634 --> 05:04.403
that's due up for trial
in two weeks, correct?

05:04.405 --> 05:06.004
- Yeah.
- Mm-Hm.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.873
This case has been bouncing
around this court

05:07.875 --> 05:10.409
- for what, six years now?
- Your Honor,

05:11.779 --> 05:14.313
I'm sorry, I'm Jamal's mother.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.849
We've tried but we haven't
been able to find

05:17.851 --> 05:19.785
anyone to help us.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.888
Mr. Randolph,
do you wish to proceed?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.359
Yeah.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.332
Well, representing yourself
is not a good idea.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.467
Mr. Trainer,

05:37.571 --> 05:40.405
please return to the podium.
Please.

05:40.407 --> 05:43.008
- Uh...
- Please.

05:45.813 --> 05:49.681
Well, I see, Trainer, you have
an impressive record here.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.085
It... uh,
from the looks of it you've managed to turn down every case

05:53.087 --> 05:56.788
in which any court has attempted to
appoint you to represent an indigent client.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.690
Your Honor, if I may?

05:58.692 --> 06:01.593
Ah, ah,
did I ask you to speak,

06:01.595 --> 06:05.397
Counselor?
No, you may not.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.868
According to the docket,
you have never handled

06:09.870 --> 06:11.970
a pro bono case
for this court or any court.

06:11.972 --> 06:15.607
I make donations. I... I write
a lot of checks for charities.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.076
Accepting appointments
to represent a client

06:18.078 --> 06:19.845
who cannot afford a lawyer

06:19.847 --> 06:22.147
is responsibility
that you owe to the bar.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.684
And I have a responsibility to my corporate clients and my firm.

06:25.686 --> 06:29.454
Mr. Randolph, meet your new lawyer,
Michael Trainer.

06:31.158 --> 06:34.459
- Oh, hell, no.
- Your Honor, my practice

06:34.461 --> 06:36.094
is confined
to corporate litigation, not--

06:36.096 --> 06:37.963
Unconfine it.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.701
Next case.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.770
Kanan versus Melissa.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.439
What the fuck just happened?

06:51.545 --> 06:55.147
Jesus, we got three trials next month.
How are we gonna try this case?

06:55.149 --> 06:58.016
We're not.
You're gonna find a conflict.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.986
Can't we just assign someone from the firm to the case?

07:00.988 --> 07:03.655
They have legal aid
for people like him.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.956
People like him?

07:06.693 --> 07:09.628
Don't do that.
You know what I mean.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.737
Okay. Now,
let's not gonna rush this

07:18.739 --> 07:21.206
because I've seen this go terribly wrong.

07:21.208 --> 07:25.877
No, no, my daughter's idiot ex-husband Barry,
cursed him from the start.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.079
At the wedding I'm making
the toast around the table,

07:28.081 --> 07:30.582
Barry comes in hard,
six glasses shatter,

07:30.584 --> 07:33.118
- champagne goes everywhere.
- Oh, no.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.887
So before we raise a glass,
I want to say,

07:35.889 --> 07:40.091
Bellcore will be the first private foster company to go public ever.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.893
Vince, what are
the stock projections?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.929
Three-hundred-percent increase
in year one,

07:43.931 --> 07:46.598
- plus or minus twenty percent.
- Okay, I'll take that

07:46.600 --> 07:50.001
plus or minus. Ms.
Dupree, where are we at with the collateral litigation?

07:50.003 --> 07:53.805
Ten lawsuits in total.
Six should be dismissed by the end of the month.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.208
Three we can settle
for under fifty.

07:56.210 --> 07:59.177
Six and three. That's nine.

07:59.179 --> 08:03.248
Yes, there's a kid in Chicago.
Just got assigned a lawyer, corporate guy.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.984
- Shouldn't be a problem.
- Oh, I see. Okay, come here,

08:07.187 --> 08:12.190
let's make sure
that it's not a problem.

08:12.192 --> 08:15.727
- Yes.
- Okay. Good enough. Now come in gently...

08:27.808 --> 08:29.574
My key still works.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.576
It might be better
if you'd knock.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.551
Of course.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.018
- Where's Benny?
- He's back in his bunk.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.921
- Hey, Benny.
- Yeah?

08:42.923 --> 08:44.956
- Your dad's here.
- Okay.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.996
You don't... don't...
you don't have to do that.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.903
I, uh...

08:59.773 --> 09:01.806
I can't take Benny
for the whole weekend.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.611
- What is it this time?
- I have to go to Chicago.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.147
- Are you two arguing again?
- No.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.716
- How you doing, buddy?
- I'm fine.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.587
Hey, uh,
show your dad your picture.

09:16.890 --> 09:21.092
Oh... that's terrific.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.695
It's you.
He... he drew a picture of you.

09:23.697 --> 09:27.299
I... I tried to get out of it,
but the judge forced me to take

09:27.301 --> 09:31.903
- a pro bono case.
- What's pro bono?

09:31.905 --> 09:35.774
Pro bono.
Well, that's where the judge forces you to do something for free.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.109
- How come?
- You got me.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.679
When somebody
can't afford a lawyer,

09:40.681 --> 09:42.814
the judge tries to be helpful
and appoints an attorney.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.082
What happened to him?

09:45.018 --> 09:48.587
He got hurt and he wants money
from the people

09:48.589 --> 09:50.255
he thinks are responsible.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.724
- Will they give it to him?
- Maybe a little.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.826
Did they only
hurt him a little?

09:54.828 --> 09:57.295
The company doesn't
think that they hurt him at all.

10:00.801 --> 10:01.967
What do you think?

10:01.968 --> 10:03.134
I think he'll be lucky
to get a dime. Come on.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.137
Hey.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.641
- Come on.
- Bye, Mom.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.209
Bye, sweetheart. Have fun.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.678
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.154
We'll settle this by noon
and be out of here.

10:23.156 --> 10:26.358
All right.
How do you think this kid's gonna present?

10:26.360 --> 10:28.159
Like a thug.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.928
Yeah, that's not gonna help.

10:31.298 --> 10:35.033
Mr. Trainer.
I'm so glad to finally meet you.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.970
I'm... I'm Shaina. Excuse me,
I'm Shaina Randolph, Jamal's mother.

10:38.972 --> 10:43.008
My husband and I googled you and your reputation is impeccable.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.277
Well, Miss Randolph,
you can't believe everything you read on Google.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.879
A liberal invented it.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.662
Excuse me, could you remove
his cuffs please?

11:03.664 --> 11:05.230
Protocol.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.904
- James Randolph?
- Jamal.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.207
Jamal Randolph. Okay.

11:17.711 --> 11:21.346
Today we are going to have a pre-trial.
You know what that is?

11:21.348 --> 11:24.416
That's where we try
to settle this case

11:24.418 --> 11:26.418
and get some money
in your pocket.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.387
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.856
Just some bullshit.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.159
The defendant,
Bellcore Family Services

11:34.161 --> 11:36.227
has offered you 40,000 dollars.

11:36.229 --> 11:39.698
I'd like to get that up
to say 70, 75.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.401
- Does that sound good?
- Nope.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.904
All right. Maybe 80.

11:45.906 --> 11:49.274
It ain't about the money,
three-piece.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.410
It's always about the money.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.046
And three-piece suits
went out in the '80s.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.749
- Are you deaf, old man?
- Maybe 90.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.418
Why the fuck do I have
to have you as my lawyer?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.490
You're a real charmer,
you know that?

12:09.730 --> 12:12.097
Judge Taylor
will see you both in chambers.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.433
You work on it.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.108
You know you should count
yourself lucky

12:23.110 --> 12:25.043
to be represented
by Mr. Trainer.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.979
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-Hm.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.982
Now, how much does he pay
you to kiss that ass?

12:39.760 --> 12:42.327
- Michael Trainer.
- Samuel Collins.

12:42.329 --> 12:46.397
Judge, we have told the plaintiff we'll pay 40,000 if he'll take it.

12:46.399 --> 12:50.034
My client's digging his heels in but I'm still working on it.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.336
So what's your demand?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.906
Offer a hundred.
Let's see what we can do.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.475
I may be able to do 75.

13:00.180 --> 13:04.215
Mr. Collins, do you mind if I have a moment with Mr.
Trainer, please?

13:07.254 --> 13:08.386
Thank you.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.960
Mr. Trainer, well,
the last demand by your client,

13:15.962 --> 13:19.964
before you were appointed,
uh, was, uh, 20 million dollars.

13:19.966 --> 13:23.268
Now hundred thousand dollars,
that seems a little uh... a little shy

13:23.270 --> 13:25.136
- in comparison, wouldn't you say so?
- Yeah,

13:25.138 --> 13:26.504
- 20 million dollars?
- Uh-huh.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.807
It's totally unrealistic.

13:28.809 --> 13:32.277
Did the allegations
that when, uh,

13:32.279 --> 13:35.246
Jamal Randolph
was a ten-year-old child,

13:35.248 --> 13:39.284
Bellcore negligently ignored
his repeated complaints

13:39.286 --> 13:41.553
when a 16-year-old,
who was also in place,

13:41.555 --> 13:45.256
brutally raped and tortured him
for a three-year period.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.892
- Yes, I've read the case.
- Ah.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.262
They're allegations,
as you say.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.932
Well, Bellcore, that's
a private corporation that buys

13:53.934 --> 13:56.501
contracts from the states
for foster care, is that right?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.437
It's a business, a big business.
There's nothing illegal about that.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.341
- Is Bellcore your... your client?
- Excuse me?

14:03.343 --> 14:07.011
Well, you seem to know more about
them than you know about, uh, Jamal.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.849
Your Honor,
this is a respected corporation

14:10.851 --> 14:14.352
versus a kid
that looks like a thug.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.420
Thug.

14:18.425 --> 14:21.292
What does a thug
look like to you?

14:21.294 --> 14:24.329
It doesn't matter what I think,
it's what the jury sees.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.931
It's the whole package,
the attitude, the hair.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.199
Hair?

14:30.437 --> 14:32.971
Why are you selling out
your client?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.106
I sell out nobody.
Who do you think you are?

14:35.108 --> 14:37.609
Sit down.
I'm gonna have you disbarred.

14:37.611 --> 14:41.045
Fine.
I could retire tomorrow.

14:41.047 --> 14:44.382
Go. Then maybe you can get that
money that you did protecting

14:44.384 --> 14:47.518
those corporations then you can
retire to your private golf club

14:47.520 --> 14:51.356
and then you can stand over your putter trying to get the perfect putt

14:51.358 --> 14:53.925
knowing goddamn well that you haven't done anything for anybody

14:53.927 --> 14:55.193
but yourself.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.464
Get out of my chambers.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.033
I'm sure you have someplace else
to go, Mr. Trainer.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.989
What are you looking at?

15:28.328 --> 15:29.627
Remain seated.

15:36.670 --> 15:40.371
All right. Have you gentlemen
reached a settlement?

15:44.344 --> 15:46.177
No settlement.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.278
Okay.

15:49.149 --> 15:53.351
Trial starts Monday morning at 9:00 a.m. Start picking the jury.

15:53.353 --> 15:57.055
Monday? I can't. That
doesn't give me time to prepare.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.024
That's what the last two weeks were about.
Monday, Mr. Trainer.

16:00.026 --> 16:03.294
Your Honor, I need to clean my client up.
I need to get him a haircut.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.563
I handle cases,
I'm not a barber.

16:05.565 --> 16:09.267
I can't put my client in front
of a jury looking like this.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.070
Side room in there if you like.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.443
All rise.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.216
Don't even be thinking about touching my hair, three-piece.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.087
Let me tell you
something, kid.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.291
You want me to try this case,
I guess I have to.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.760
But there's one thing that
I don't do and that is lose.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.428
- I'm not your kid.
- Clearly!

16:37.430 --> 16:38.763
Back up, three-piece!

16:51.578 --> 16:54.212
Keisha, figure this out.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.290
You ain't touching my hair,
girl.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.661
Name's Keisha, not Girl.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.198
Don't be like them.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.201
To win,
you got to play the game,

17:17.203 --> 17:19.103
especially their game.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.308
Come on now,
you don't want to scare these white folk, do you?

17:28.181 --> 17:30.081
Start the car,
get the heat going.

17:30.717 --> 17:34.452
See if you can find
some hotel rooms in this city.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.439
How come you're playing
his game?

17:55.341 --> 17:57.508
- I'm not.
- Please.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.844
You're following the man around,
you're doing his dirty.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.780
You think this game
only belongs to him?

18:02.782 --> 18:04.248
Well, it don't.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.585
Belongs to me just as much.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.522
Besides, I'm playing what I need
to get to where I need to get.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.860
All right, girl...
I mean, Keisha.

18:44.624 --> 18:48.259
All right. All right.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.169
For your opening statement.

18:58.171 --> 19:02.173
Thank you.
Yeah, take these depositions

19:02.175 --> 19:04.775
and give me an outline of my cross exams by tomorrow morning.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.716
We got nothing, you know?
This is a joke.

19:11.718 --> 19:15.219
No, we've got a young man
with no money

19:15.221 --> 19:17.622
who won't accept
an $80,000 settlement.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.924
That's something.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.370
What happened
at chambers today?

19:34.874 --> 19:36.207
Nothing.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.263
Mind if I join you,
Mr. Trainer?

19:59.933 --> 20:02.200
Do I know you?

20:02.202 --> 20:05.469
Pamela Dupree, vice president
of Bellcore Family Services.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.505
We didn't get a chance
to meet in court.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.309
Uh...

20:12.645 --> 20:14.445
You know we looked you up,
Michael.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.280
You're normally on our side
of the fence.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.649
Doing your homework.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.987
I also read that you're a bit
of a wine snob.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.656
Côtes du Rhône.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.626
It's your favorite, right?

20:28.628 --> 20:30.962
"Côtes", the "s" is silent.

20:35.435 --> 20:39.604
Must be frustrating being stuck in Chicago away from your family.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.473
Well, I don't have much
of a say in the matter.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.744
Sometimes I find
a glass or two of wine

20:46.746 --> 20:48.779
is more productive
than hours in a courtroom.

20:48.781 --> 20:49.914
Good point.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.819
Thank you.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.489
You know, we're not
so different, you and I.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.659
I worked my way up
through the company,

21:01.661 --> 21:04.996
started as a caseworker,
then manager,

21:04.998 --> 21:07.598
now I'm vice president of claims
and a major shareholder.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.270
Because of who you are and the type of clients you have,

21:12.272 --> 21:14.805
I think we can get this up
to a hundred thousand.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.443
The kid won't settle.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.546
Bellcore took over where the government failed,
Mr. Trainer.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.749
The State had over 20,000 kids
in Child Services.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.951
Now we do it all.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.854
Pretty soon Bellcore Family Services will be in all 50 states.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.024
- Private companies do it better.
- Yeah,

21:33.026 --> 21:35.426
private companies
do some things better.

21:35.428 --> 21:38.496
They make a good fork, a good knife,
a nice glass of red wine.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.065
The trouble is
a child is not a product.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.701
You joining
the Green Party?

21:43.703 --> 21:46.804
I'm sure you'd know if I was.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.674
Jury's not gonna believe
a black drug dealer.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.809
A couple pills,
I'll keep it out.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.878
Won't keep out
the color of his skin.

21:56.516 --> 21:59.417
- The kid is a mess.
- Kid was a mess before Bellcore got a hold of him.

21:59.419 --> 22:02.053
The kid was four years old before Bellcore got a hold of him.

22:02.055 --> 22:04.689
- Where were the parents?
- Maybe Bellcore never told

22:04.691 --> 22:07.858
the Randolphs about Joey Poule's
violent history.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.563
I'm authorized to go
to 150,000, that's it.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.533
Wow.
You just went to $150,000

22:15.535 --> 22:17.401
and I haven't had a sip
of that red wine.

22:21.107 --> 22:24.008
This is a nuisance case,
Mr. Trainer,

22:24.010 --> 22:28.346
just like the dozen or so you and I have handled over the years.

22:28.348 --> 22:31.515
Take the offer to your client,

22:31.517 --> 22:36.020
then you can go back home to your son, Benjamin,
is that it?

22:46.666 --> 22:50.534
We've completed the jury selection.
Are you ready to proceed?

22:50.536 --> 22:51.736
Your Honor, may I have a minute?

22:51.738 --> 22:52.937
I'll let you have five.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.972
Then I'm calling the jury.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.107
Thank you.

22:56.109 --> 23:01.445
- Bellcore upped the offer to 150,000.
- I already said no.

23:12.392 --> 23:15.860
What? What did you see?

23:15.862 --> 23:17.128
That's her.

23:34.947 --> 23:38.449
- Ms. Dupree!
- That's enough!

23:38.451 --> 23:40.518
You get inside.

23:50.129 --> 23:53.130
Good morning.
Bellcore offered $150,000.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.666
I have a fiduciary
responsibility to tell you that

23:55.668 --> 23:58.836
- that's a lot of money.
- Did they...

23:58.838 --> 24:02.706
ever put a criminal in another home like they did with us?

24:02.708 --> 24:04.809
There have been
other allegations.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.044
- I need to talk to you outside.
- Sure.

24:14.887 --> 24:17.822
What are you seeing there,
Mr. Trainer?

24:17.824 --> 24:23.093
Do you see a young man who has
lost three years of his life?

24:23.095 --> 24:25.062
Do you see his shame?

24:25.064 --> 24:27.631
Or is all you can see
is another opportunity

24:27.633 --> 24:30.100
to be done with this case?

24:30.102 --> 24:31.936
Miss Randolph,
with all due respect--

24:31.938 --> 24:33.704
You're a father, aren't you?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.908
I'm telling you now,
we are not gonna settle.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.879
Shine a light on what they did,

24:41.881 --> 24:44.748
fight for that child
as if he were your own.

24:48.087 --> 24:54.625
Jamal was eight.
It's pretty difficult those first few months.

24:55.761 --> 24:57.795
Never heard so many curse words.

25:03.903 --> 25:07.538
Bill, they are here.

25:07.540 --> 25:08.906
I thought
they were coming tomorrow.

25:08.908 --> 25:11.008
It doesn't look that way.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.042
Just put that stuff.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.881
Mr. And Mrs. Randolph.
I'm Ms. Dupree.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.649
We spoke on the phone.
How are you?

25:18.651 --> 25:20.050
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:24.156 --> 25:27.157
- Hello there, James.
- It's Jamal.

25:28.594 --> 25:29.727
Jamal then.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.868
Did Jamal ever talk
about his past?

25:40.139 --> 25:41.672
It was off limits.

25:43.175 --> 25:48.078
Pamela Dupree placed Joey Poule
in your home, is that correct?

25:48.915 --> 25:51.582
- Yes.
- Did she ever talk to you

25:51.584 --> 25:54.318
about Joey's past,
uh, any violent tendency--

25:54.320 --> 25:58.088
Objection, Your Honor,
we have never established that either Bellcore

25:58.090 --> 26:00.624
or Ms. Dupree would have had
access to that information.

26:00.626 --> 26:01.725
Sustained.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.132
How long after Joey
moved into your home

26:08.134 --> 26:11.669
did you begin to see a difference in Jamal's behavior?

26:13.072 --> 26:15.806
I should have seen it
right away, but I didn't.

26:19.812 --> 26:23.614
Easy, girl, easy.

26:23.616 --> 26:24.682
What you doing?

26:29.121 --> 26:32.122
I wonder what Sasha would look like
with the pitchfork sticking out of her.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.064
I know this
must be difficult but...

26:40.066 --> 26:43.968
can you explain to the jury
the changes that you saw

26:43.970 --> 26:45.269
specifically?

26:48.240 --> 26:51.909
He became angry, distant,

26:54.814 --> 26:57.281
sometimes
he didn't leave his room.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.987
And this was
because of Joey Poule?

27:02.989 --> 27:05.255
Objection, Your Honor,
requires speculation.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.858
- Sustained.
- No further questions.

27:13.399 --> 27:16.033
Thank you for being here,
Mrs. Randolph.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.135
I understand
that it's very difficult.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.037
We'll try to make it
as easy as possible.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.108
How much were you paid
to be a foster mother,

27:24.110 --> 27:26.744
- Mrs. Randolph?
- I don't know.

27:26.746 --> 27:30.648
We have receipts,
$450 per month?

27:31.951 --> 27:35.019
I... I guess.
I didn't count it.

27:35.021 --> 27:39.089
And you took in over 20 children over the years,
is that correct?

27:39.091 --> 27:42.059
- Yes, but--
- Four-fifty per kid,

27:42.061 --> 27:46.830
that comes to over $145,000
you made. Is that right?

27:46.832 --> 27:50.701
We spent it
on the children-clothing, food.

27:50.703 --> 27:53.170
You own a farm, Mrs. Randolph,
you grow food.

27:53.172 --> 27:57.708
- We do.
- In fact, I see that you recorded a surplus

27:57.710 --> 27:59.209
for going on 10 years now.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.178
Bill has a green thumb.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.681
It appears so.
A 10-year surplus, you made

28:03.683 --> 28:05.783
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.385
Tell me something,
is this a picture

28:08.387 --> 28:10.721
of a new truck that you
and your family have bought?

28:10.723 --> 28:12.990
Exhibit 25, counselor.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.992
We bought a new truck, yes.

28:14.994 --> 28:20.431
And this one, is this a picture
of your new tractor, 26?

28:20.433 --> 28:22.733
Because the old one broke down.

28:22.735 --> 28:26.036
Of course. Of course.
But this new one

28:26.038 --> 28:29.106
is a lot bigger
than the old tractor, isn't it?

28:29.108 --> 28:33.110
- Covers a lot more ground, plows a lot more land.
- Yes.

28:33.112 --> 28:36.080
Meaning bigger profits
for you and Mr. Randolph.

28:36.082 --> 28:40.284
- When the crops are good.
- I'm sure you'll do fine with Mr. Randolph's green thumb.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.986
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

28:42.988 --> 28:46.256
- Stick to a question, Counselor.
- Fair enough, Your Honor.

28:48.027 --> 28:51.995
Question, Mrs. Randolph.
Am I correct here in reading

28:51.997 --> 28:55.232
that you have already applied
to Bellcore

28:55.234 --> 28:59.336
- to host, yet, another foster child?
- Yes, that is true.

28:59.338 --> 29:04.742
In spite of the alleged horrifying experiences with Joey Poule?

29:04.744 --> 29:07.811
Children need help,
Mr. Collins.

29:07.813 --> 29:11.949
Are you helping
the children, Mrs. Randolph?

29:11.951 --> 29:14.752
- Or, are you helping yourself?
- Your Honor.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.353
Don't answer that question,
Mrs. Randolph.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.455
Counselor,
you're pushing your luck.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.791
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

29:28.167 --> 29:34.805
Jamal. Jamal. Jamal.

29:34.807 --> 29:37.007
Fuck him
and what he said about my mom.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.942
That's his job, he's trying
to get under your skin.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.211
Fuck his job, three-piece.

29:41.213 --> 29:44.348
Mr. Trainer,
call your next witness.

29:44.350 --> 29:47.384
All right.
It's time for you to get up there and tell your story.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.121
What is it?

29:52.324 --> 29:54.525
- I can't.
- You can't? Okay.

29:54.527 --> 29:56.994
- Then I'll go over and accept their offer.
- No.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.432
Those are your options.

30:02.434 --> 30:05.435
Either you accept their offer
or you tell your story.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.006
Plaintiff would like to call
James Randolph to the stand.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.842
State your name
for the record.

30:18.350 --> 30:21.185
Please state your name
for the record.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.886
Say your name.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.890
Um...

30:33.532 --> 30:40.270
James Randolph,
but I... I go by Jamal.

30:40.272 --> 30:45.242
Good. Jamal,
one of your first foster homes

30:45.244 --> 30:47.444
was with Stephanie Myers.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.314
Tell us what happened.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.524
I, um...

31:11.871 --> 31:13.637
Where the fuck
you been, boy?

31:16.141 --> 31:19.509
- What you got to say, boy?
- Nothing.

31:20.946 --> 31:22.346
Get over here.

31:27.353 --> 31:31.555
So you play with yourself
all the time.

31:31.557 --> 31:32.990
What'd I tell you
about playing with yourself?

31:32.992 --> 31:34.358
You want
to grow up to be a faggot?

31:34.360 --> 31:36.159
No.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.631
Little faggot playing
with yourself in front of me.

31:40.633 --> 31:43.033
You disrespected me.
That's what you're doing.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.534
You little nasty
piece of shit.

31:46.338 --> 31:49.539
- You don't remember?
- I... I don't remember.

31:50.509 --> 31:55.612
Okay. Well, uh, let's
move on for the moment. Uh...

31:57.516 --> 32:01.051
after the Myers you moved in
with the Ryan family. Uh...

32:02.655 --> 32:04.254
do you remember
the Ryan family?

32:05.157 --> 32:07.157
You stayed with them
before the Randolphs.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.659
Don't you remember?

32:09.695 --> 32:11.428
You lived with them.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.938
You'll get two
of these a month.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.708
Miss Dupree.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.576
Look at me.

32:29.949 --> 32:34.251
- You look at me.
- Miss Dupree!

32:35.688 --> 32:38.622
Miss Dupree! Please.

32:40.259 --> 32:41.625
Jamal.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.195
Jamal.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.596
Jamal, I asked you a question.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.266
What... what... what, man?

32:50.469 --> 32:53.003
What do you remember
about the Ryans?

32:57.743 --> 33:00.444
- Nothing.
- Jesus Christ.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.512
Excuse me, Counselor.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.381
He said nothing.

33:04.383 --> 33:07.050
Let's move on to the next
line of questions.

33:07.052 --> 33:09.152
Your Honor,
may I have a quick word with my client?

33:10.556 --> 33:13.557
Okay, we'll take a five-minute recess.

33:15.094 --> 33:18.595
You asked why do you
have to have me as your lawyer.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.032
Why do I have to have you
as my client?

33:23.102 --> 33:25.268
Do you ever think of that? Hmm?

33:26.438 --> 33:31.041
No.
Because you're too busy thinking the world owes you something.

33:32.378 --> 33:36.413
I'm the bad guy, right?
I ask you to settle, I'm a sellout.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.016
I wear nice clothes
and I'm a fucking three-piece.

33:40.652 --> 33:43.020
You don't know shit about me.

33:43.022 --> 33:45.122
So let me tell you
a little bit about myself.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.457
I know how to practice law.
That's what I know.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.726
I know how to win cases.

33:49.728 --> 33:52.529
So if you want to win,
you've got to go out there

33:52.531 --> 33:56.800
and you've got to tell those 12 people getting paid $15 a day your story.

33:56.802 --> 33:59.136
If you don't want to win,
then don't talk.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.507
- I'm trying.
- Good,

34:03.509 --> 34:05.609
because your five minutes
are up.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.320
Tell us what happened, Jamal.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.296
Why did you file this lawsuit?

34:32.504 --> 34:36.106
Jamal, why did you file
this lawsuit?

34:37.776 --> 34:40.177
Answer the question,
Mr. Randolph.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.479
- Tell us what happened.
- You little piece of shit.

34:42.481 --> 34:45.182
Why did you file this lawsuit?

34:45.184 --> 34:47.451
What are we even doing here?

34:47.453 --> 34:50.620
- Tell us what happened.
- Leave me the fuck alone!

34:50.622 --> 34:53.723
- All of you! You don't get it, man!
- Order.

34:53.725 --> 34:56.259
- You fucking listen, man.
- Order.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.229
You don't want to get it, right?
So fuck it. Fuck this shit.

34:59.231 --> 35:02.132
- Order in the court.
- Fuck it. I'm out of here. This is some bullshit.

35:02.134 --> 35:04.167
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- Back in the witness stand.

35:04.169 --> 35:05.669
No, I'm not getting back
on the stand.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.304
- Calm down.
- Jamal.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.172
Fuck out of my way...

35:09.174 --> 35:11.641
Hey, Jamal!

35:16.248 --> 35:17.414
Easy.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.189
Get up.

35:26.191 --> 35:27.724
Get him out of here.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.361
I told you, man.
I told you.

35:31.363 --> 35:34.831
Ladies and gentlemen,
yeah, the trial resumes

35:34.833 --> 35:37.400
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

35:50.883 --> 35:53.150
Michael, can I talk to you?

35:53.152 --> 35:55.285
Tell Jeff, he'll fill me in.

35:55.287 --> 35:56.753
No, Sir, I need to talk to you.

35:56.755 --> 36:02.859
I think you should stop talking at Jamal and try listening to him.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.694
Have you been
paying attention at all?

36:04.696 --> 36:06.463
That's all I do is listen.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.499
You want to help me,
tell him to start talking

36:09.501 --> 36:10.901
or we're going to lose
this case.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.171
Jamal left these behind.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.274
I think it'd be good
for you to take a look.

38:13.592 --> 38:17.060
- Why are you here?
- Because I'm your lawyer.

38:19.598 --> 38:23.300
You can withdraw from the case.
I'm not gonna fight you on it.

38:23.302 --> 38:27.037
I don't want to.
I believe you.

38:27.973 --> 38:32.042
I lost my shit
and the jury see me get tased,

38:32.044 --> 38:33.677
so the game...

38:34.813 --> 38:37.981
- is over.
- Now, the good news is

38:37.983 --> 38:40.517
that the jury decides
when it's over

38:40.519 --> 38:42.852
and they haven't decided.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.854
You left these
in the courtroom.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.026
What are they?

38:51.730 --> 38:54.097
They're my verses.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.332
Verses?

38:56.601 --> 38:57.600
Yeah.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.338
About my past.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.940
- Would you read them to me?
- Hell, no.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.677
Ain't gonna happen.
You're tripping.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.412
Read them to me anyway.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.883
Man, you're crazy.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.423
My ex-wife
would agree with you.

39:20.425 --> 39:22.092
- Read them to me.
- No.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.794
You ain't gonna get it.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.374
Read them to me.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.541
No,

39:40.812 --> 39:42.645
you're not gonna get it.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.007
"Counting my...

40:48.780 --> 40:50.580
days from the cage.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.219
In so many ways

41:00.926 --> 41:02.592
it's all that I've known.

41:05.630 --> 41:06.930
Cell's been my home.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.768
Chaotic environments.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.071
I've been growing with violence,

41:16.641 --> 41:17.707
still scream..."

41:25.083 --> 41:26.850
It's stupid.

41:27.786 --> 41:32.655
No, no, it's not stupid.

41:40.966 --> 41:44.067
Yeah. I--

41:44.069 --> 41:47.136
Actually I got it right here.
Michael, I got Reynolds.

41:48.874 --> 41:51.140
He's looking at your notes on the German case.
You got a second?

41:52.944 --> 41:55.712
Tell him we're busy
with this case.

41:55.714 --> 41:58.147
He's on his own.

41:58.149 --> 42:00.850
- <i>I need you to try--</i>
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.753
- <i>I can't run it without him.</i>
- I... I don't know what to tell you.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.258
It's Dad.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.862
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:13.732 --> 42:16.633
Benny gets his leg braces
off today, right?

42:16.635 --> 42:17.734
Could I speak to him?

42:17.736 --> 42:18.768
Sure.

42:21.940 --> 42:24.607
- Hello.
- Hey, how you feeling?

42:24.609 --> 42:28.645
Good. How... how's the case
going? Did you win?

42:28.647 --> 42:30.613
Well, not yet,
it's a tough one.

42:30.615 --> 42:32.015
Don't you always win?

42:32.017 --> 42:33.683
Not always, no.

42:33.685 --> 42:35.318
Well, you should win this one.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.953
Well, I'm gonna do my best.

42:40.859 --> 42:41.858
Here's Mom.

42:44.930 --> 42:48.565
Listen, Kim,
you think I could have Ben

42:48.567 --> 42:50.967
- for the Thanksgiving weekend?
- In Chicago?

42:50.969 --> 42:53.970
Yeah, you put him on the plane,
I'll pick him up on the other end.

42:53.972 --> 42:56.105
It'll be nice,
the two of us can hang out.

42:56.107 --> 42:58.041
I don't know.

42:59.010 --> 43:00.977
Well, will you think about it?

43:01.913 --> 43:03.813
Yeah, yeah, I'll think about it.

43:32.010 --> 43:33.109
Hello.

43:35.080 --> 43:38.014
No, it's fine,
I'm... I'm wide awake.

43:39.918 --> 43:41.818
Again, I am very sorry
to bother you, Sir,

43:41.820 --> 43:44.887
but a man left you
an urgent package.

43:44.889 --> 43:47.223
- Did you see who left it?
- No, Sir.

43:47.225 --> 43:49.025
Thanks, Sanjay.

44:14.886 --> 44:16.719
- Where's Jeff?
- I don't know.

44:16.721 --> 44:19.288
I... I checked his room
and nobody answered.

44:19.290 --> 44:21.391
Well, it is 5:30 in the morning.

44:21.393 --> 44:23.860
Somebody dropped off
a dozen Bellcore documents

44:23.862 --> 44:26.663
showing that Joey Poule
had a history of violence.

44:26.665 --> 44:28.998
He molested his own sister
and his niece.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.134
- God knows how many other children.
- Jesus.

44:31.136 --> 44:33.403
I need you to find out
who dropped those off.

44:33.405 --> 44:34.971
Okay.

44:34.973 --> 44:38.174
And, Keisha, thank you. I...

44:39.310 --> 44:42.412
I apologize for not being
more properly dressed.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.281
It's okay, Mr. Trainer.

45:02.434 --> 45:03.433
Hello.

45:07.472 --> 45:08.738
How?

45:13.812 --> 45:14.977
I understand.

46:13.471 --> 46:18.341
Mr. Cohen. My name is Keisha.
I work with the Trainer Firm.

46:18.343 --> 46:20.543
- I would love to talk--
- Sorry, I am very busy.

46:21.980 --> 46:23.780
Did you work with Pamela Dupree?

46:23.782 --> 46:25.448
Uh, I... I have an appointment.

46:25.450 --> 46:28.284
- Uh, I am late.
- Mr. Cohen.

46:29.988 --> 46:31.854
Did you work with Pamela Dupree?

46:48.439 --> 46:50.139
Hi.

46:52.076 --> 46:55.444
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>
<i>How is the trial going?</i>

46:55.446 --> 46:57.480
Uh, it's different.

46:58.349 --> 47:01.484
- <i>How?</i>
- My client's telling the truth.

47:01.486 --> 47:04.554
Oh, wow, that's something
different for you, huh.

47:04.556 --> 47:07.023
Yeah, it's something.

47:07.025 --> 47:10.126
So I... I talked to Benny
about Thanksgiving.

47:10.128 --> 47:13.162
He said yes.
And I want him to go see you.

47:13.164 --> 47:14.964
<i>I think it'll be good</i>
<i>for both of you.</i>

47:14.966 --> 47:17.333
That's great. Tell him
I can't wait to see him.

47:17.335 --> 47:21.003
- We'll go ride horses in the park.
- Horses?

47:21.005 --> 47:24.273
Well, don't worry, they're old nags,
they don't go very fast.

47:24.275 --> 47:28.211
Okay. Just be careful, Michael,
he just got those braces off.

47:28.213 --> 47:31.147
Of course, yeah. Um...

47:34.986 --> 47:36.185
Bye?

47:38.289 --> 47:39.422
Bye.

47:53.171 --> 47:57.506
Yes. No, I'll be overseas.

47:59.510 --> 48:01.510
He wasn't angry.

48:03.181 --> 48:04.247
I know.

48:07.051 --> 48:10.920
Yeah. Open it.
I'll call you back.

48:10.922 --> 48:12.388
We took the trouble
of calculating

48:12.390 --> 48:14.490
how much
you stand to gain if this

48:14.492 --> 48:17.293
- public offering goes through.
- It will go through, Simon.

48:17.295 --> 48:19.462
There's no reason
to think it won't.

48:19.464 --> 48:23.900
Did you know that we are Cal Air's biggest corporate client?

48:23.902 --> 48:26.002
I... I did not.

48:26.004 --> 48:27.370
You should have.

48:29.207 --> 48:32.008
Play harder. We can't lose this.

48:42.620 --> 48:44.987
- Jeff, can you check on that?
- Yeah.

48:44.989 --> 48:46.555
Excuse me. Michael.

48:50.094 --> 48:52.328
What is this?
Some kind of a joke?

48:52.330 --> 48:53.963
I'm afraid not.

48:55.633 --> 48:57.033
Come on.

49:02.307 --> 49:04.140
Tim,
this is Michael Trainer calling.

49:04.142 --> 49:06.709
I just received
some very alarming news.

49:06.711 --> 49:08.311
Could you please call me back?

49:20.992 --> 49:25.261
Hey, hey, Dupree.

49:25.263 --> 49:27.063
You're behind this,
aren't you?

49:27.065 --> 49:29.131
What did you say to Cal Air?

49:29.133 --> 49:31.500
Cal Air makes its own decisions,
Mr. Trainer,

49:31.502 --> 49:33.970
and they decided not to work
with you anymore.

49:33.972 --> 49:36.072
You're a real piece of shit,
you know that?

49:37.342 --> 49:39.375
Be careful, Mr. Trainer.

49:39.377 --> 49:41.577
Cal Air was just the beginning.

49:53.291 --> 49:55.524
Give me the Bellcore file.

49:55.526 --> 49:57.360
- Sir, the file is--
- What Bellcore file?

49:57.362 --> 49:59.595
Your Honor, I'd like to recall

49:59.597 --> 50:01.230
Jamal Randolph to the stand.

50:01.232 --> 50:02.732
You may proceed.

50:02.734 --> 50:05.334
Jamal, I need you
to go back on the stand.

50:05.336 --> 50:07.470
All you have to do is say yes.
I'll do the rest.

50:07.472 --> 50:09.739
Michael, what are you doing?

50:21.219 --> 50:23.352
Jamal, you were
tortured in the Ryan home

50:23.354 --> 50:25.554
and their own file shows that,
isn't that true?

50:25.556 --> 50:27.456
What file?
Objection, Your Honor.

50:27.458 --> 50:30.092
Your own file shows
that they placed Joey Poule

50:30.094 --> 50:31.327
- and Randolph--
- Side bar, please.

50:31.329 --> 50:32.628
Counselor!

50:32.630 --> 50:33.696
...this previous sexual assault.

50:33.698 --> 50:35.498
Counselor!

50:43.074 --> 50:45.341
Judge, I have several case notes
to show that Bellcore

50:45.343 --> 50:48.577
knew that Joey Poule had sexually assaulted other children.

50:48.579 --> 50:51.047
I have never seen
these documents.

50:51.049 --> 50:52.114
Can I see that?

50:57.188 --> 50:58.821
Where'd you get this?

50:58.823 --> 51:00.756
Someone dropped them off
at my hotel.

51:00.758 --> 51:03.426
Judge,
this is what discovery is for.

51:03.428 --> 51:06.062
Without any... any foundation
how do we establish

51:06.064 --> 51:08.497
the authenticity of these documents?
How do we know Mr. Trainer

51:08.499 --> 51:10.166
didn't create
these documents himself?

51:10.168 --> 51:12.234
- That's bullshit.
- It's enough.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.703
He has no witness
to lay a foundation.

51:14.705 --> 51:16.305
How do you know?

51:16.307 --> 51:18.307
I'm making a really good guess.

51:21.279 --> 51:22.311
Do you?

51:25.249 --> 51:29.118
- No, not yet.
- You can be damn sure unless you can find the person

51:29.120 --> 51:31.520
who can authenticate
this document,

51:31.522 --> 51:33.322
it's not going in.

51:38.229 --> 51:43.599
Ms. Dupree, you were Jamal Randolph and
Joey Poule's caseworker for four years

51:43.601 --> 51:46.335
and you're telling the jury
that you had no knowledge

51:46.337 --> 51:49.572
that Joey Poule sexually
assaulted Jamal Randolph?

51:49.574 --> 51:51.373
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

51:51.375 --> 51:53.175
Counsel, you've asked
the same question

51:53.177 --> 51:54.844
three straight times. Move on.

51:54.846 --> 52:00.282
Apparently, putting your hand on the
Bible and taking the oath means nothing.

52:00.284 --> 52:02.118
What was that you said,
Counselor?

52:02.120 --> 52:03.452
Nothing, Your Honor.

52:08.493 --> 52:12.361
I'd like to show you what's been marked as exhibit number 23.

52:12.363 --> 52:14.497
Objection, Your Honor.

52:14.499 --> 52:17.600
If this document is not already
familiar to the witness,

52:17.602 --> 52:19.835
then there is no foundation
for its introduction.

52:19.837 --> 52:21.303
Take it down.

52:26.811 --> 52:29.578
I'm showing you a copy
of a mental health record

52:29.580 --> 52:33.415
that shows that Joey Poule raped his own sister and cousin.

52:33.417 --> 52:34.884
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

52:34.886 --> 52:36.819
Counselor, show that document

52:36.821 --> 52:40.256
to Ms. Dupree and see
if she recognizes it first.

52:42.193 --> 52:43.559
You recognize that document?

52:48.166 --> 52:49.865
Never saw it before, Counselor.

52:52.236 --> 52:55.304
The jury is instructed
to disregard it.

52:55.306 --> 52:56.639
Move on.

52:57.575 --> 52:58.674
Ms. Dupree,

53:01.279 --> 53:05.814
- did you know Joey Poule raped his sister?
- No, I did not.

53:05.816 --> 53:09.285
- Did you know that he raped his cousin?
- I never knew.

53:09.287 --> 53:12.521
Did you know that he beat
and raped Jamal Randolph?

53:12.523 --> 53:15.424
Never knew any of it, Counselor.

53:23.234 --> 53:27.503
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for our Thanksgiving break.

53:27.505 --> 53:29.905
And the jury is instructed
not to discuss this case

53:29.907 --> 53:31.941
or to read about it.

53:33.945 --> 53:35.678
All rise.

53:40.518 --> 53:42.651
- She's lying.
- I know she is.

53:42.653 --> 53:45.221
We should take
their last offer.

53:45.223 --> 53:47.523
And why would we do that?

53:47.525 --> 53:50.326
We can't introduce a damn thing.
I know they'd settle this right now.

53:50.328 --> 53:53.729
No, we're playing the game.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.233
There's your answer.

54:01.239 --> 54:03.472
I'm, uh... I'm gonna grab
a flight out.

54:03.474 --> 54:07.476
- What?
- It's, uh... it's Thanksgiving weekend, right?

54:07.478 --> 54:09.345
Right.
But you be back Saturday.

54:10.715 --> 54:12.481
You're not coming back, are you?

54:14.952 --> 54:17.686
When Michael found out about Cal Air,
you weren't surprised.

54:17.688 --> 54:18.687
You knew.

54:20.324 --> 54:22.925
I'm leaving.
I'm starting my own firm.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.761
- With no clients.
- Cal Air is going with him.

54:28.032 --> 54:29.732
Is that true?

54:29.734 --> 54:31.867
Ten years
and this is what it comes to?

54:31.869 --> 54:33.736
You had your day, Michael.

54:33.738 --> 54:37.473
You're making a fool of yourself in that courtroom,
isn't that obvious?

54:37.475 --> 54:38.807
Dupree got to you, didn't she?

54:38.809 --> 54:40.709
That's what they do, Jeff.

54:40.711 --> 54:43.946
No loyalty.
People like Dupree go to Cal Air

54:43.948 --> 54:45.714
and make deals
and people like you accept them.

54:45.716 --> 54:47.950
For 10 years
I watched you get rich off

54:47.952 --> 54:50.519
of companies like Bellcore destroying anyone who got in your way

54:50.521 --> 54:53.922
and now, all of a sudden,
you have a change of heart.

54:53.924 --> 54:57.459
You think defending that kid
makes you some kind of savior?

54:58.562 --> 54:59.928
You should have settled.

55:01.866 --> 55:03.299
Happy Thanksgiving.

55:13.644 --> 55:16.345
<i>Please, leave a message.</i>

55:16.347 --> 55:19.615
Kim, it's Michael. I've called,
left a couple of messages.

55:19.617 --> 55:21.750
I haven't heard back.

55:21.752 --> 55:24.019
I still don't have
Benny's flight information.

55:24.021 --> 55:25.521
Can you please call me?

55:35.633 --> 55:38.600
Mr.
Trainer, I've just received an urgent message from your wife.

55:39.570 --> 55:42.604
That's weird.
Why... why wouldn't she have called my cell?

55:42.606 --> 55:44.840
She said she couldn't get
through to your mobile phone.

55:44.842 --> 55:46.975
She wanted me to let you know that your son's changed his mind.

55:46.977 --> 55:48.911
He won't make it
for Thanksgiving.

55:49.814 --> 55:50.879
Yeah.

55:51.782 --> 55:52.848
Sorry, Sir.

55:54.418 --> 55:55.384
Thanks.

Hey, Jamal.

58:46.690 --> 58:47.756
Yo.

58:51.529 --> 58:53.962
- What the hell happened to you?
- I was jogging.

58:53.964 --> 58:55.931
Somebody almost ran me over.
Get in.

58:57.001 --> 58:58.767
Unlock the door.

59:05.142 --> 59:06.642
You think it was Bellcore.

59:06.644 --> 59:09.244
Could have been an accident.

59:09.246 --> 59:11.013
I think it was a warning.

59:46.183 --> 59:48.116
Mr. Cohen,
we need to speak to you.

59:51.121 --> 59:55.190
I know you're the one that dropped those documents off at my hotel.

59:58.696 --> 1:00:00.262
I need you to testify.

1:00:07.304 --> 1:00:11.173
You have no idea what
these people are capable of.

1:00:11.175 --> 1:00:12.240
Do you remember Jamal?

1:00:14.044 --> 1:00:17.913
- Hey, Mr. Cohen.
- I want you to look at this young man's face

1:00:17.915 --> 1:00:20.115
and tell him that you
are not going to help him.

1:00:22.186 --> 1:00:23.919
I never wanted you to get hurt.

1:00:23.921 --> 1:00:25.721
I never wanted
any of them to get hurt.

1:00:25.723 --> 1:00:26.922
But we did.

1:00:29.860 --> 1:00:31.627
The more placements that fail,

1:00:31.629 --> 1:00:34.363
the more money
that Bellcore makes, okay?

1:00:34.365 --> 1:00:36.298
Wait, how did they fail?

1:00:40.838 --> 1:00:43.171
Let's say that the government
pays 3000 bucks

1:00:43.173 --> 1:00:44.940
per foster care placement,

1:00:44.942 --> 1:00:46.408
but it doesn't work out.

1:00:46.410 --> 1:00:49.378
So then,
Bellcore places the kid again

1:00:49.380 --> 1:00:51.413
and they make
another 3000 bucks.

1:00:52.316 --> 1:00:55.684
The whole system
is designed to fail.

1:00:55.686 --> 1:00:57.786
Mr. Cohen, I need you
to tell this to the jury.

1:00:57.788 --> 1:00:59.221
I can't.

1:00:59.223 --> 1:01:00.822
Mr. Cohen.

1:01:05.129 --> 1:01:06.862
What are you laughing at?

1:01:09.667 --> 1:01:13.435
You know, sometimes
this shit is so thick

1:01:13.437 --> 1:01:15.771
that the only thing you can do
is laugh, Mr. Trainer.

1:01:15.773 --> 1:01:17.005
It's not funny.

1:01:18.208 --> 1:01:19.441
We're gonna lose.

1:01:20.344 --> 1:01:22.244
No, we're not.

1:01:24.848 --> 1:01:26.882
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

1:01:26.884 --> 1:01:29.051
No, it is.
You fought for me

1:01:30.087 --> 1:01:31.319
and that means something.

1:01:33.857 --> 1:01:34.956
It's not okay.

1:01:42.866 --> 1:01:44.766
Is there something else
on your mind?

1:01:47.304 --> 1:01:48.937
No, nothing.

1:01:54.878 --> 1:01:59.314
My son was supposed to fly in from Los Angeles today and he cancelled,
all right?

1:02:00.217 --> 1:02:02.818
It's really tough. Sorry.

1:02:02.820 --> 1:02:06.388
Yeah. Well, it's my own fault.
I haven't been the best father.

1:02:09.126 --> 1:02:10.826
How old is your son?

1:02:12.029 --> 1:02:16.164
Ten.

1:02:16.166 --> 1:02:18.767
Then you're not done
being a father.

1:04:54.992 --> 1:04:57.425
Good evening, Mr. Trainer.
Hope you've had a nice day.

1:04:58.595 --> 1:05:01.029
Sanjay, can I use
the house phone?

1:05:01.031 --> 1:05:02.631
Yeah, of course, Sir.

1:05:02.633 --> 1:05:04.432
- Dial 9.
- Indeed.

1:05:11.475 --> 1:05:15.911
Hi, it's Michael. Yeah.
Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.

1:05:15.913 --> 1:05:18.280
Uh, listen,
could I speak to Kim?

1:05:21.385 --> 1:05:23.351
- Michael.
- <i>Kim.</i>

1:05:24.621 --> 1:05:26.488
- Why are you calling on my dad's phone?
- <i>Kim,</i>

1:05:26.490 --> 1:05:28.423
is everything all right
with you and Benny?

1:05:28.425 --> 1:05:30.025
I've been calling you all day.

1:05:30.027 --> 1:05:32.260
What are you talking about?

1:05:32.262 --> 1:05:34.296
<i>Benny's with you.</i>
<i>I put him on the plane</i>

1:05:34.298 --> 1:05:36.698
<i>this morning like we planned.</i>

1:05:36.700 --> 1:05:41.069
<i>Kim, get on a plane</i>
<i>to Chicago right now.</i>

1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:45.473
<i>This is Pamela Dupree,</i>
<i>Vice President of Bellcore</i>

1:05:45.475 --> 1:05:47.542
<i>Family Service,</i>
<i>please leave a message.</i>

1:05:47.544 --> 1:05:50.578
I know you're behind this.
I will destroy you

1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:53.515
and your fucking company
if anything happens to my son.

1:05:53.517 --> 1:05:55.183
Do you understand me?

1:05:58.155 --> 1:06:01.089
¶ <i>...crucial</i>
<i>But I ain't even mad man</i> ¶

1:06:01.091 --> 1:06:03.692
¶ <i>I'm glad I had the illusion 'Cause I ain't need No struggles</i> ¶

1:06:03.694 --> 1:06:07.128
¶ <i>And I ain't need no worries I just need To take this goal</i> ¶

1:06:07.130 --> 1:06:10.165
¶ <i>Hold me till I'm 30 Need that green
in my pocket Need that black in my...</i> ¶

1:06:10.167 --> 1:06:12.167
- Get down, now. Now!
- No, no, no!

1:06:12.169 --> 1:06:14.469
Why are you here? Relax.
You're gonna get me killed.

1:06:14.471 --> 1:06:16.271
- Turn around.
- Shit!

1:06:16.273 --> 1:06:17.973
- All right, all right.
- Hands behind your head,

1:06:17.975 --> 1:06:19.207
interlace your fingers.

1:06:19.209 --> 1:06:21.009
Why are you here?

1:06:21.011 --> 1:06:23.244
Get down on the floor.

1:06:23.246 --> 1:06:25.146
- Get down on the floor.
- Hey, man, I didn't do shit.

1:06:25.148 --> 1:06:27.315
Hands out in front of you.

1:06:27.317 --> 1:06:30.986
Man, I didn't do anything,
all right? I just got out.

1:06:30.988 --> 1:06:33.021
- What is happening here?
- Stay where you are,

1:06:33.023 --> 1:06:34.255
What are you doing?
It's my phone.

1:06:34.257 --> 1:06:35.690
That's not his.

1:06:35.692 --> 1:06:38.159
- Get up, get up!
- That is not his.

1:06:38.161 --> 1:06:40.095
You set me up.
Why you set me up?

1:06:40.097 --> 1:06:42.230
- Jamal.
- Just do what they say.

1:06:42.232 --> 1:06:43.999
Son, just do what they say.

1:06:49.740 --> 1:06:55.143
712? Okay. Yes, okay. Thank you.

1:06:55.145 --> 1:06:59.714
Mr. Trainer the airline did confirm that
your son was on the flight this morning.

1:06:59.716 --> 1:07:01.449
- No.
- They phoned you six times,

1:07:01.451 --> 1:07:02.484
you didn't answer.

1:07:05.155 --> 1:07:07.355
- They jammed my phone.
- Sir, who jammed your phone?

1:07:07.357 --> 1:07:09.591
It doesn't matter.
Where is my son?

1:07:09.593 --> 1:07:12.260
- He would have been picked up by the police.
- What precinct?

1:07:12.262 --> 1:07:14.462
The eighth district station
will be the closest.

1:07:16.333 --> 1:07:19.167
10-4 he's on his way to you.

1:07:24.574 --> 1:07:26.508
Hands on the bar.

1:07:26.510 --> 1:07:28.276
Hands on the bars.

1:07:39.222 --> 1:07:42.824
Guard. Guard.

1:07:44.428 --> 1:07:45.660
How you doing?

1:07:51.368 --> 1:07:52.567
Long time no see.

1:07:56.339 --> 1:07:57.806
How long has it been,

1:07:59.643 --> 1:08:01.209
ten years or so?

1:08:02.212 --> 1:08:04.179
Step back, Joey.

1:08:04.181 --> 1:08:05.747
Huh, a decade's a long time.

1:08:07.717 --> 1:08:09.284
What you got here?

1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:11.419
Put my shit down.

1:08:15.358 --> 1:08:16.825
Yeah, well, I'm betting you...

1:08:21.198 --> 1:08:23.231
Shit happens.
Right, little bro?

1:08:25.168 --> 1:08:28.670
Nah, you need
to step back, Joey.

1:08:32.375 --> 1:08:33.391
I'm not a kid anymore.

1:08:33.392 --> 1:08:34.408
I just want to say "hi"
to my little brother.

1:08:35.812 --> 1:08:37.312
That's all.

1:08:47.858 --> 1:08:49.824
You got tall,

1:08:52.229 --> 1:08:53.795
but you are still a pussy.

1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:58.533
We had a good time, me and you

1:08:59.903 --> 1:09:01.436
in that barn, right?

1:09:07.677 --> 1:09:09.177
I know you liked it.

1:09:09.179 --> 1:09:12.447
You like this, huh, big bro?

1:09:12.449 --> 1:09:14.315
I'm gonna fucking
kill you, Joey!

1:09:14.317 --> 1:09:17.318
I was a fucking kid.
I was a kid.

1:09:17.320 --> 1:09:19.320
Fuck you, you...

1:09:28.665 --> 1:09:30.198
Fuck!

1:09:31.568 --> 1:09:33.902
What the fuck
are you looking at, huh?

1:09:42.245 --> 1:09:43.378
You're lucky.

1:09:44.915 --> 1:09:46.181
I'm not lucky.

1:09:48.852 --> 1:09:52.253
I'm not lucky.

1:09:52.255 --> 1:09:54.255
<i>You're lucky</i>
<i>you showed up when you did.</i>

1:09:54.257 --> 1:09:56.191
Children Services
was held up, but your son

1:09:56.193 --> 1:09:57.759
was about to be placed
into emergency--

1:09:57.761 --> 1:10:00.428
But where is he?
Where's my son?

1:10:00.430 --> 1:10:02.430
- Mr. Trainer.
- Dad.

1:10:02.432 --> 1:10:04.766
Benny. Oh!

1:10:08.572 --> 1:10:09.671
Oh!

1:10:30.694 --> 1:10:33.761
Randolph, move back.
You got a visitor.

1:10:34.831 --> 1:10:36.397
Put your shoes on.

1:10:40.437 --> 1:10:42.870
How did Joey Poule
end up in my cell, huh?

1:10:43.740 --> 1:10:45.240
How the fuck should I know?

1:10:45.875 --> 1:10:47.976
I think you fucking know.

1:10:47.978 --> 1:10:49.744
I don't give a fuck
what you think.

1:10:50.614 --> 1:10:52.280
Move back.

1:11:10.667 --> 1:11:12.033
Let go of my fucking arm.

1:11:29.019 --> 1:11:31.286
They try and run you over again?

1:11:32.522 --> 1:11:33.988
They, uh...

1:11:35.859 --> 1:11:37.025
they took my son.

1:11:37.027 --> 1:11:38.993
Oh, shit! He all right?

1:11:38.995 --> 1:11:41.462
Yeah. He's fine.

1:11:49.973 --> 1:11:52.040
We've been bringing a knife
to a gunfight.

1:11:53.443 --> 1:11:55.343
It's time to even the odds,

1:11:55.345 --> 1:11:57.312
straighten this shit out
a little bit.

1:12:01.084 --> 1:12:02.517
How much you got in your wallet?

1:12:02.519 --> 1:12:03.818
What?

1:12:03.820 --> 1:12:05.687
Sit down.

1:12:11.328 --> 1:12:12.660
How much?

1:12:14.831 --> 1:12:19.033
I don't know, maybe a thousand,
more. I don't know.

1:12:19.035 --> 1:12:21.002
Jesus Christ.

1:12:22.105 --> 1:12:24.105
Oh, yes.

1:12:24.107 --> 1:12:27.642
- Give it to me.
- What are you gonna do with it?

1:12:31.715 --> 1:12:34.582
Sometimes we gotta do things
a little different in my world

1:12:36.753 --> 1:12:39.087
and you're in my world now.

1:12:39.089 --> 1:12:41.055
I came here to bail you out.

1:12:41.057 --> 1:12:43.057
I don't want
to get bailed out yet.

1:12:43.893 --> 1:12:45.526
I got work to do.

1:12:45.528 --> 1:12:47.628
Send Keisha
to bail me out tomorrow.

1:12:51.601 --> 1:12:52.800
Mr. Trainer,

1:12:54.404 --> 1:12:57.772
you take care of your boy,
all right?

1:13:05.749 --> 1:13:07.448
I got this.

1:13:10.887 --> 1:13:12.520
Guard!

1:13:15.024 --> 1:13:16.924
Don't look so mad, all right?

1:13:16.926 --> 1:13:19.527
It don't suit you.
I know I got it right.

1:13:45.789 --> 1:13:47.121
You're still awake?

1:13:51.528 --> 1:13:52.894
Who are these people?

1:13:53.997 --> 1:13:56.130
What are they capable of?

1:14:00.637 --> 1:14:02.103
I, honestly, don't know.

1:14:07.777 --> 1:14:09.644
Are you safe?

1:14:09.646 --> 1:14:10.878
Oh, yeah.

1:14:15.785 --> 1:14:17.819
But I don't think it's safe
for you and Benny.

1:14:19.222 --> 1:14:21.556
I think you should go back
to Los Angeles.

1:14:28.765 --> 1:14:31.699
I need 15 minutes
like we talked about, all right?

1:14:31.701 --> 1:14:33.000
Disappear.

1:14:38.708 --> 1:14:40.208
¶ <i>I can't breathe...</i> ¶

1:14:40.210 --> 1:14:42.043
Have a seat. Have a seat.
Relax, relax.

1:14:42.045 --> 1:14:44.645
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Chill, just relax.

1:14:44.647 --> 1:14:46.547
We're cool for now.

1:14:46.549 --> 1:14:47.682
What the fuck is this?

1:14:47.684 --> 1:14:48.916
Shut that, D.

1:14:53.623 --> 1:14:56.691
Hey, guard.
Would you do something?

1:14:56.693 --> 1:14:58.993
Hey, guard! Hey, guard!

1:14:59.996 --> 1:15:01.596
How much they paying you, Joey?

1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:05.199
¶ <i>I can't breathe...</i> ¶

1:15:05.201 --> 1:15:07.802
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

1:15:07.804 --> 1:15:09.737
I think you do know
what I'm talking about.

1:15:09.739 --> 1:15:11.506
- No.
- I'm not stupid.

1:15:11.508 --> 1:15:14.675
No. I don't know
what you are talking about.

1:15:19.249 --> 1:15:22.517
- Fuck you!
- Hey, hey, hey, chill, chill,

1:15:22.519 --> 1:15:25.052
chill, chill, chill, chill,
chill. It's okay, man. I got it.

1:15:25.054 --> 1:15:27.221
¶ <i>I can't breathe...</i> ¶

1:15:28.858 --> 1:15:30.024
Have a seat.

1:15:34.797 --> 1:15:36.631
Let's try this again.

1:15:39.202 --> 1:15:41.202
I need you to tell me names.

1:15:43.573 --> 1:15:46.741
I need you to tell me
who got to you.

1:15:46.743 --> 1:15:48.976
Tell me what you know
about the pigs

1:15:48.978 --> 1:15:53.080
who arrested me
and how I ended up in jail

1:15:53.082 --> 1:15:54.582
with you?

1:15:56.152 --> 1:15:57.752
Talk, Joey!

1:16:16.940 --> 1:16:18.806
- Yo.
- Hey.

1:16:18.808 --> 1:16:19.941
Thanks for bailing me out.

1:16:19.943 --> 1:16:22.209
Not a problem. You ready?

1:16:22.211 --> 1:16:24.078
Uh, there's something
I gotta do.

1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:25.880
- What do you mean? We have court.
- I know,

1:16:25.882 --> 1:16:28.015
but it's important.

1:16:28.017 --> 1:16:29.116
Okay.

1:16:35.191 --> 1:16:37.892
Mr. Cohen.

1:16:37.894 --> 1:16:39.994
Hey, I'm not going anywhere,
all right?

1:16:51.708 --> 1:16:53.140
Come on, man. Open up.

1:16:57.981 --> 1:16:59.380
Hi.

1:17:05.288 --> 1:17:09.357
Cop gave me 2k. Said he needed
me to be in jail here with you.

1:17:11.728 --> 1:17:12.927
I rough you up,

1:17:14.897 --> 1:17:17.098
cut you, if I needed to.

1:17:18.234 --> 1:17:20.801
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>I don't know why. I don't know why.</i>

1:17:20.803 --> 1:17:22.670
<i>I didn't have</i>
<i>much of a choice, dude.</i>

1:17:22.672 --> 1:17:24.372
<i>I mean they got me</i>
<i>on some drummed-up shit.</i>

1:17:24.374 --> 1:17:27.208
<i>- I don't know why.</i>
- <i>What happened?</i>

1:17:27.210 --> 1:17:28.976
<i>Man, I just told you</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

1:17:28.978 --> 1:17:31.278
<i>What happened to you, Joey?</i>

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:33.814
<i>The same shit that always happens to guys like you and me.</i>

1:17:35.385 --> 1:17:37.251
That is not my fault.

1:17:49.799 --> 1:17:52.867
Your Honor, may I approach?

1:17:57.974 --> 1:18:00.941
Your Honor,
my client has several notebooks.

1:18:00.943 --> 1:18:04.011
I'd like him to be able to use them to refresh his recollection.

1:18:04.013 --> 1:18:06.814
I object, Your Honor.
They have never been produced in discovery.

1:18:06.816 --> 1:18:09.884
Your Honor,
a witness can use notes to refresh recollections.

1:18:11.054 --> 1:18:12.420
- I'll allow it.
- Thank you.

1:18:12.422 --> 1:18:17.892
Your Honor, there is one more thing,
my client will need to rap his testimony.

1:18:17.894 --> 1:18:21.228
I'm sorry, excuse me.
Did you say "rap"?

1:18:21.230 --> 1:18:24.365
- Are you serious, Counselor?
- Uh, well, First Amendment,

1:18:24.367 --> 1:18:26.867
right to testify.
If the only way my client

1:18:26.869 --> 1:18:28.402
can tell his story
is through rapping

1:18:28.404 --> 1:18:30.705
- then you cannot deny him.
- Uh, Your Honor,

1:18:30.707 --> 1:18:33.374
he has cited
no case law or precedent.

1:18:34.277 --> 1:18:37.144
Your Honor, the Americans
with Disabilities Act, require

1:18:37.146 --> 1:18:40.147
court to accommodate a witness if he
or she has difficulty communicating.

1:18:40.149 --> 1:18:43.250
No such difficulty has ever been established in this case,
Your Honor.

1:18:43.252 --> 1:18:45.920
In the case
of United States versus Durant,

1:18:45.922 --> 1:18:49.256
the witness suffered from PTSD
and had a comfort animal, a dog.

1:18:49.258 --> 1:18:51.759
Okay, okay,
a notebook is not a dog

1:18:51.761 --> 1:18:53.427
and this plaintiff
is not disabled.

1:18:53.429 --> 1:18:56.063
Here are a line of cases
where the court allowed

1:18:56.065 --> 1:18:59.200
for interpreters or even allowed a
woman to speak while holding her child.

1:18:59.202 --> 1:19:01.902
- This is absurd, Your Honor.
- And in the case

1:19:01.904 --> 1:19:03.904
of Michaels versus Donnelly,
the court allowed a man

1:19:03.906 --> 1:19:07.108
afraid of crowds to face
the wall while testifying.

1:19:12.081 --> 1:19:13.314
I'll allow it.

1:19:15.118 --> 1:19:16.117
Thank you.

1:19:17.987 --> 1:19:20.221
Don't overstep
your balance, Counselor.

1:19:23.059 --> 1:19:24.058
Are you ready?

1:19:27.463 --> 1:19:31.031
This motherfucker's itching to tase me again, man.
I know it.

1:19:31.934 --> 1:19:33.100
You'll be fine.

1:19:40.042 --> 1:19:42.777
The plaintiff recalls Jamal Randolph to the stand.

1:19:42.779 --> 1:19:44.278
Note my continuing objection.

1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:46.080
Your continuing objection noted,

1:19:46.082 --> 1:19:48.115
now continue to sit down.

1:19:52.421 --> 1:19:55.556
Jamal, you write, don't you?

1:20:03.966 --> 1:20:04.999
Yeah.

1:20:05.835 --> 1:20:08.803
- Lyrics, poems...
- Verses.

1:20:11.140 --> 1:20:12.873
I write verses.

1:20:12.875 --> 1:20:15.509
Verses, yes, I'm sorry.

1:20:15.511 --> 1:20:19.079
Uh, verses
about what happened to you

1:20:19.081 --> 1:20:22.183
and you keep them in those notebooks,
is that correct?

1:20:23.352 --> 1:20:28.122
- Yeah.
- Now, I'm going to ask you some questions.

1:20:28.124 --> 1:20:30.324
You don't have to look
at anybody.

1:20:30.326 --> 1:20:32.593
You don't have to look at the jury.
You don't have to look at me.

1:20:33.930 --> 1:20:37.498
Just tell us
what happened. Okay?

1:20:58.387 --> 1:21:00.354
"By age eight a cruel fate,

1:21:02.024 --> 1:21:03.424
found a meaning and lost it.

1:21:04.493 --> 1:21:07.561
Ripped from the comfort
of a family and taken by cops,

1:21:09.532 --> 1:21:13.534
the foster boy, a broken toy,
a plaything, now a victim

1:21:14.604 --> 1:21:16.937
going through revolving doors

1:21:18.541 --> 1:21:20.507
of a foster care system.

1:21:22.578 --> 1:21:26.046
No, mama.

1:21:27.049 --> 1:21:28.382
Why, mama?

1:21:31.621 --> 1:21:34.355
Now, you ain't my real mama,
you my high mama.

1:21:37.293 --> 1:21:39.960
All I wanted was a hug
and a hi, mama.

1:21:43.499 --> 1:21:46.133
Take your fucking hands
from my thigh, mama.

1:21:50.606 --> 1:21:52.006
Flame of a lighter,

1:21:53.476 --> 1:21:57.578
Stephanie Myers, cigarette
and Guinness-style crack pipe

1:21:57.580 --> 1:22:00.047
hanging from my mouth
spent all-nighters,

1:22:00.683 --> 1:22:03.584
watching talk shows all alone
on the couch.

1:22:05.087 --> 1:22:07.454
Hide and seek, ain't a game

1:22:07.456 --> 1:22:09.456
if I'm screaming ouch!

1:22:10.426 --> 1:22:11.659
'Cause if she takes a hit,

1:22:13.696 --> 1:22:15.462
then I'm taking hits.

1:22:18.167 --> 1:22:21.268
I'm hoping she quits
'cause I can't take this shit."

1:22:37.219 --> 1:22:38.452
You want a break?

1:22:40.990 --> 1:22:43.624
No, no, no break. I'm cool.

1:22:44.994 --> 1:22:46.026
Okay.

1:22:47.330 --> 1:22:49.730
Jamal, I'm gonna ask you
about the Ryan family.

1:22:51.100 --> 1:22:53.067
Can you tell us about the Ryans?

1:22:54.236 --> 1:22:55.336
Yeah.

1:22:58.541 --> 1:23:00.674
I ain't never gonna forget
the Ryans.

1:23:05.681 --> 1:23:08.015
<i>"I'm afraid</i>
<i>of what I turned into.</i>

1:23:09.552 --> 1:23:11.385
<i>Ain't what it's supposed to..."</i>

1:23:13.622 --> 1:23:15.622
You pissed the bed again?

1:23:15.624 --> 1:23:18.058
<i>"All I see are walls,</i>

1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:19.393
<i>no room at all."</i>

1:23:21.163 --> 1:23:24.264
- Why do you lie to me?
- Let go of me.

1:23:24.266 --> 1:23:27.267
<i>"So, where do I go to?</i>
<i>No one loves a bastard</i>

1:23:27.269 --> 1:23:30.104
<i>like the misery</i>
<i>he's prone to.</i>

1:23:30.106 --> 1:23:31.705
- <i>Better days..."</i>
- Drink it.

1:23:31.707 --> 1:23:34.241
- <i>"And little care..."</i>
- Drink it!

1:23:35.177 --> 1:23:37.478
<i>"Misfortune</i>

1:23:38.414 --> 1:23:41.215
<i>No matter where,</i>

1:23:42.718 --> 1:23:46.153
They only want me for a check,
check, can you hear me?

1:23:48.257 --> 1:23:52.292
Ryan watched.
I peed the bed.

1:23:53.429 --> 1:23:58.032
He flipped the switch.
Kicked my crotch.

1:23:58.034 --> 1:24:01.402
Ripped and beat me.
Trick and treat me.

1:24:01.404 --> 1:24:04.371
That's who I had to call 'pops'.

1:24:04.373 --> 1:24:07.274
Pop goes the lid
off the vinegar jar.

1:24:07.276 --> 1:24:10.177
Pop me in the jaw,
now I'm seeing stars.

1:24:12.248 --> 1:24:13.447
It's hard.

1:24:18.254 --> 1:24:19.253
It's hard.

1:24:26.195 --> 1:24:28.128
I'm sorry, Jamal, but...

1:24:29.698 --> 1:24:32.199
we need to talk
about the Randolphs.

1:24:33.135 --> 1:24:35.569
Can you tell us what happened
at the Randolph home?

1:25:05.101 --> 1:25:06.266
Joey Poule...

1:25:09.371 --> 1:25:11.271
raped me for three years.

1:25:15.311 --> 1:25:16.743
It started when I was ten.

1:25:18.314 --> 1:25:20.814
Did you ever tell anyone, Jamal?

1:25:22.384 --> 1:25:25.419
- Her.
- Pamela Dupree.

1:25:27.590 --> 1:25:29.523
And what did she say to you

1:25:29.525 --> 1:25:31.225
when you told her, Jamal?

1:25:35.397 --> 1:25:36.697
She said...

1:25:38.834 --> 1:25:40.767
that I was lucky to have a home.

1:26:04.326 --> 1:26:07.628
Mr. Randolph, I was moved

1:26:09.165 --> 1:26:12.599
by the songs that you rapped to us during your direct testimony,

1:26:14.803 --> 1:26:18.305
but they were just that.
Am I right?

1:26:19.942 --> 1:26:22.843
Songs. I... I'm...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,

1:26:23.946 --> 1:26:24.945
verses.

1:26:28.350 --> 1:26:32.186
- They're the truth.
- Okay, okay. So you say.

1:26:32.955 --> 1:26:35.556
So, is there anyone else

1:26:35.558 --> 1:26:39.359
in the courtroom here today who can verify your truth for us?

1:26:42.665 --> 1:26:44.464
Anyone at all?

1:26:46.635 --> 1:26:50.204
No one, not Ms. Ryan,
no other foster parents,

1:26:50.206 --> 1:26:53.640
not even any kids from the neighborhood,
there's nobody here,

1:26:53.642 --> 1:26:55.809
to sing the same tune as you.

1:26:57.513 --> 1:26:59.446
Isn't that right?

1:26:59.448 --> 1:27:01.848
- It's the truth.
- The truth,

1:27:01.850 --> 1:27:03.951
the songs that you wrote down
in these notebooks?

1:27:03.953 --> 1:27:05.819
Yeah, I wrote the songs.

1:27:05.821 --> 1:27:08.822
Okay, are the songs
that you shared

1:27:08.824 --> 1:27:10.924
with us today the only songs
that are inside the books?

1:27:10.926 --> 1:27:14.494
- No.
- Well, what other kinds of songs have you written?

1:27:15.364 --> 1:27:17.331
Uh, I don't know,
a lot of stuff.

1:27:17.333 --> 1:27:21.435
I mean have you ever written
any songs about say, um,

1:27:21.437 --> 1:27:23.503
I don't know,
places that you've never been

1:27:23.505 --> 1:27:26.540
or, uh, romances
you never actually had

1:27:26.542 --> 1:27:28.575
sexual experiences
you wished you had?

1:27:28.577 --> 1:27:30.777
- No.
- No, nothing from your imagination?

1:27:30.779 --> 1:27:33.280
- No.
- So,

1:27:34.383 --> 1:27:36.283
I want you to be careful
here, Mr. Randolph,

1:27:36.285 --> 1:27:38.318
you're telling
the court here today

1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:39.920
that if we look through
these books,

1:27:39.922 --> 1:27:42.256
which we can do,
which we will do,

1:27:42.258 --> 1:27:45.559
that we will not find
a single song that you made up.

1:27:45.561 --> 1:27:47.628
That everything
inside these notebooks,

1:27:47.630 --> 1:27:50.998
there must be what?
Uh, uh, a hundred or more

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.402
and that every one of them
is a true factual account

1:27:55.404 --> 1:27:57.404
of something
that actually happened to you?

1:28:00.609 --> 1:28:05.445
- On some of the songs, yeah, but not... not all of them.
- Fair enough.

1:28:05.447 --> 1:28:07.848
Some of them are real
and some of them are made up,

1:28:07.850 --> 1:28:11.652
but how can we know
the difference?

1:28:11.654 --> 1:28:13.720
I'm... I'm telling you
the difference.

1:28:13.722 --> 1:28:16.790
Oh, oh, I see. Okay,

1:28:16.792 --> 1:28:21.328
so there is actually no evidence

1:28:21.330 --> 1:28:26.400
whatsoever that any of these
so-called rapes even happened

1:28:26.402 --> 1:28:28.702
except for what you
wrote down yourself

1:28:28.704 --> 1:28:30.637
inside these books

1:28:30.639 --> 1:28:32.939
that you've just admitted
are also filled

1:28:32.941 --> 1:28:36.543
with things that you sometimes
make up from your imagination?

1:28:39.982 --> 1:28:41.048
Yeah.

1:28:42.551 --> 1:28:43.950
Thanks for clearing that up.

1:28:58.867 --> 1:29:02.502
Mr. Trainer, are you ready
for closing arguments?

1:29:02.504 --> 1:29:03.837
Yes, Your Honor.

1:29:07.509 --> 1:29:09.376
If it may please the court,

1:29:09.378 --> 1:29:11.812
council members of the jury...

1:29:15.017 --> 1:29:20.954
Uh, Your Honor,
I'd like to call Daniel Cohen to the stand, if I may?

1:29:20.956 --> 1:29:23.390
You got to be kidding me.

1:29:23.392 --> 1:29:25.759
- Come on up, Mr. Cohen.
- Your Honor,

1:29:25.761 --> 1:29:27.961
this witness
appears on no witness list.

1:29:27.963 --> 1:29:29.830
We have no opportunity
to prepare.

1:29:29.832 --> 1:29:31.832
Overruled.
Step up, Mr. Cohen.

1:29:39.541 --> 1:29:41.508
Do you swear to tell
the truth the whole truth

1:29:41.510 --> 1:29:43.977
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1:29:43.979 --> 1:29:44.978
I do.

1:29:48.550 --> 1:29:51.017
State
your name for the record.

1:29:51.019 --> 1:29:53.820
- Daniel Cohen.
- Daniel Cohen,

1:29:53.822 --> 1:29:56.089
can you tell the jury
what you do for a living?

1:29:56.091 --> 1:29:57.858
A social worker.

1:29:57.860 --> 1:29:59.793
How many years
were you a social worker?

1:29:59.795 --> 1:30:01.628
- Fifteen.
- Could you tell the jury

1:30:01.630 --> 1:30:05.465
what your relationship
is to Ms. Pamela Dupree?

1:30:05.467 --> 1:30:07.868
We work together
at Bellcore Family Services.

1:30:09.171 --> 1:30:11.805
Mr. Cohen, I'm showing you
what has been marked

1:30:11.807 --> 1:30:13.440
as exhibit number 23.

1:30:13.442 --> 1:30:15.041
Famous Exhibit 23.

1:30:15.043 --> 1:30:16.476
Your Honor, I object.

1:30:16.478 --> 1:30:17.978
Give it up, Mr. Collins.

1:30:19.915 --> 1:30:22.115
- Do you recognize this document?
- I do.

1:30:22.117 --> 1:30:24.584
Mr. Cohen,
what exactly is this?

1:30:26.588 --> 1:30:30.457
- It's a... a violent incident form.
- A violent incident form

1:30:30.459 --> 1:30:32.793
And what does
the violent incident form show?

1:30:33.929 --> 1:30:35.829
It shows that Joey Poule

1:30:36.765 --> 1:30:37.964
raped his sister,

1:30:39.001 --> 1:30:41.768
put a knife up to another boy

1:30:44.540 --> 1:30:47.874
and sexually assaulted
another four-year-old child

1:30:47.876 --> 1:30:50.677
while at a residential
treatment facility

1:30:50.679 --> 1:30:53.146
just six months
before Pamela Dupree

1:30:53.148 --> 1:30:55.515
placed him with the Randolphs.

1:30:55.517 --> 1:30:59.119
Mr. Cohen, where is it
that you found this document?

1:31:01.790 --> 1:31:04.691
I saw Ms. Dupree
throw it in the garbage...

1:31:06.595 --> 1:31:08.228
...and I took it out.

1:31:09.064 --> 1:31:11.832
That's true,
isn't it, Mrs. Dupree?

1:31:11.834 --> 1:31:13.767
You threw it in the trash

1:31:13.769 --> 1:31:16.470
because you knew that Joey Poule

1:31:16.472 --> 1:31:18.605
had a history
of sexual violence.

1:31:18.607 --> 1:31:21.141
- Isn't that true?
- Objection, Your Honor.

1:31:21.143 --> 1:31:24.144
Ms. Dupree
is not on the witness stand.

1:31:24.146 --> 1:31:26.046
She's already under oath,

1:31:26.048 --> 1:31:27.914
it doesn't matter
what chair she sits in.

1:31:28.851 --> 1:31:30.717
Answer the question, Ms. Dupree.

1:31:33.856 --> 1:31:37.524
Isn't it true that Bellcore
Family Services paid you bonuses

1:31:39.495 --> 1:31:42.162
that you personally
received money

1:31:42.164 --> 1:31:44.898
for each child you placed
in a foster home?

1:31:44.900 --> 1:31:46.800
Isn't that true, Ms. Dupree?

1:31:49.605 --> 1:31:54.040
All right, um,
on the advice of my counsel,

1:31:54.042 --> 1:31:57.544
I am going to exercise
my Fifth Amendment right.

1:31:59.748 --> 1:32:03.116
Your Honor,
the plaintiff would like to amend the request

1:32:03.118 --> 1:32:04.885
and ask for punitive damages.

1:32:04.887 --> 1:32:06.853
Your Honor,
the defense asserts

1:32:06.855 --> 1:32:10.824
that punitive damages
are not called for in this case.

1:32:10.826 --> 1:32:12.058
Mr. Trainer,

1:32:13.762 --> 1:32:15.595
your motion is granted.

1:32:42.624 --> 1:32:45.859
If it may please
the court, counsel,

1:32:45.861 --> 1:32:47.661
members of the jury.

1:32:59.741 --> 1:33:01.975
I didn't want this case.

1:33:05.147 --> 1:33:07.981
I didn't want this case
because when I looked at Jamal,

1:33:09.585 --> 1:33:10.684
I saw a thug,

1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:14.654
a freeloader,
a tax on our system.

1:33:16.191 --> 1:33:18.191
Sometimes when we meet people,

1:33:19.027 --> 1:33:21.094
we don't see them
for who they truly are.

1:33:24.700 --> 1:33:28.001
I'm sorry that
I did not see you, Jamal.

1:33:32.608 --> 1:33:35.775
Over the course of this trial I've gotten to know Jamal Randolph,

1:33:35.777 --> 1:33:39.079
the 19-year-old boy
who sits before you today.

1:33:42.017 --> 1:33:44.718
But I ask you to go back
in time now, to see Jamal

1:33:44.720 --> 1:33:49.089
as a 10-year-old boy forced to live in 12 different foster homes,

1:33:49.958 --> 1:33:52.192
but, eventually,
he found the right home,

1:33:52.194 --> 1:33:55.061
the home
of Shaina and Bill Randolph,

1:33:55.063 --> 1:33:56.196
who later adopted him.

1:33:57.866 --> 1:34:00.100
They also fostered Joey Poule.

1:34:01.870 --> 1:34:04.671
Now what Jamal
and the Randolphs didn't know,

1:34:04.673 --> 1:34:06.239
what they couldn't know

1:34:08.176 --> 1:34:12.178
was that Joey Poule
had a severely violent past,

1:34:17.019 --> 1:34:18.502
a history of rape.

1:34:18.503 --> 1:34:19.986
The reason Jamal
and the Randolphs didn't know

1:34:21.356 --> 1:34:24.891
was because Pamela Dupree
and Bellcore Family Services

1:34:24.893 --> 1:34:26.993
tried to destroy those records.

1:34:34.136 --> 1:34:38.038
I'm sorry that Bellcore
did this to you, Jamal,

1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:41.274
and I can see now why it's difficult for you to trust anyone.

1:34:42.744 --> 1:34:44.377
But I'm asking you to...

1:34:44.379 --> 1:34:46.146
I'm begging you,

1:34:47.449 --> 1:34:49.949
please put your trust
in this jury.

1:34:50.919 --> 1:34:52.886
The same way that your mother
gave you hope

1:34:52.888 --> 1:34:54.988
by wrapping
her loving arms around you,

1:34:54.990 --> 1:34:57.090
this jury will give you hope

1:34:58.894 --> 1:35:01.695
by wrapping the American
Constitution around you.

1:35:04.833 --> 1:35:11.004
This is your opportunity to give Jamal and kids like him, hope.

1:35:12.107 --> 1:35:14.774
Hope that what we do
in this courtroom and courtrooms

1:35:14.776 --> 1:35:16.743
like this all across the country

1:35:18.380 --> 1:35:20.914
will never let them down again.

1:35:46.508 --> 1:35:49.743
I thought you'd be on a flight
back to Los Angeles.

1:35:49.745 --> 1:35:51.911
When was the last time
I listened to you?

1:35:53.048 --> 1:35:54.280
Good point.

1:35:55.183 --> 1:35:56.916
Some hot cocoa for you, bud.

1:36:08.296 --> 1:36:09.996
Jury's back.

1:36:18.206 --> 1:36:19.539
Have you reached a verdict?

1:36:19.541 --> 1:36:21.307
We have, Your Honor.

1:36:29.885 --> 1:36:33.820
In the manner of Jamal Randolph
versus Bellcore Family Services,

1:36:35.023 --> 1:36:37.123
we the jury,
find the defendants,

1:36:39.094 --> 1:36:43.429
guilty of deliberate indifference to the rights of Jamal Randolph

1:36:44.266 --> 1:36:46.499
and we assess damages

1:36:49.171 --> 1:36:51.871
of thirty-two million,
six hundred

1:36:51.873 --> 1:36:54.040
and fifty thousand dollars.

1:36:57.412 --> 1:37:00.847
Matter is concluded,
court is adjourned,

1:37:00.849 --> 1:37:03.249
jury is dismissed.

1:37:29.311 --> 1:37:33.479
Ms. Dupree, Ms. Dupree,
Agent Stockton with the FBI.

1:37:33.481 --> 1:37:35.248
We received
some information this morning.

1:37:35.250 --> 1:37:36.482
We have some questions for you.

1:37:37.986 --> 1:37:41.888
No, uh, I...

1:37:55.136 --> 1:37:56.135
Yeah.

1:37:59.274 --> 1:38:01.040
How much?

1:38:03.078 --> 1:38:05.645
No. We'll wait a month,

1:38:05.647 --> 1:38:08.948
it'll die down
then we'll go public.

1:38:10.619 --> 1:38:11.651
Yeah.

1:38:22.364 --> 1:38:23.897
Hey, Mr. Trainer.

1:38:26.368 --> 1:38:27.667
What you said in there...

1:38:30.138 --> 1:38:33.273
sometimes when you meet a person you
don't really see them for who they are.

1:38:35.076 --> 1:38:36.175
It's true.

1:38:39.014 --> 1:38:40.246
Thanks for everything.

1:38:43.151 --> 1:38:44.350
Three-piece.

1:38:46.521 --> 1:38:47.620
Thug!

1:38:50.025 --> 1:38:51.457
Good luck, Mr. Randolph.
