01:03.213 --> 01:04.510
Huh?

01:20.130 --> 01:22.724
- Kenji. Kenji.
- Aah!

01:22.899 --> 01:28.269
I'm paying you to clean the floors,
not stare off into space.

01:28.438 --> 01:32.534
I am sorry, Takagawa san,
but I got distracted.

01:33.910 --> 01:39.871
Sadly, that is why no one comes
to the museum anymore.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.478
Too many distractions. No discipline.

01:43.653 --> 01:46.952
No respect for the old ways.

01:47.123 --> 01:49.148
Come with me. I will show you.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.919
But I saw...

02:04.474 --> 02:09.741
Behold, the Black Samurai.

02:14.818 --> 02:17.844
The Black Samurai.

02:18.021 --> 02:20.319
Never heard of him.

02:20.490 --> 02:23.789
The most fearsome warlord
in the history of Japan.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.952
Do you see what I am getting at,
Kenji?

02:27.964 --> 02:28.988
Uh...

02:29.165 --> 02:31.156
Yes, Takagawa san.

02:31.334 --> 02:33.427
You want me to mop in here.

02:33.603 --> 02:39.166
No, that this exhibit
could save the museum.

02:48.484 --> 02:49.974
What is happening?

03:13.943 --> 03:15.740
I live.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.573
Kenji, do something.

03:18.748 --> 03:20.045
<i>Bonsai!</i>

03:23.653 --> 03:25.086
Uh?

03:45.008 --> 03:50.412
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.

05:11.694 --> 05:14.128
<i>Welcome to Shibuya Station.</i>

05:14.297 --> 05:16.595
<i>Now arriving on Track 5.</i>

05:18.167 --> 05:19.998
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

05:47.964 --> 05:50.524
Wow, we made it, gang.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.031
Shibuya Station.

05:52.201 --> 05:55.034
The most popular meeting place
in all of Tokyo.

05:55.204 --> 05:56.569
And I can see why.

05:56.739 --> 05:59.139
Everyone in Japan is already here.

05:59.876 --> 06:01.400
But, like, wouldn't you know it?

06:01.611 --> 06:04.478
We're all out of Scooby Snacks.

06:18.394 --> 06:21.591
Scooby Snacks. Scooby Snacks.

06:21.764 --> 06:24.562
Way to go, Scoob.
A Scooby Snack vending machine.

06:25.935 --> 06:27.732
Like, it's the wave of the future.

06:33.509 --> 06:35.841
Hey, I've got a text message
from Miyumi.

06:36.012 --> 06:39.675
She says,
"Meet me at the statue of Hachiko. "

06:39.849 --> 06:42.716
Any idea what this Hachiko person
looks like?

06:42.885 --> 06:45.911
Let's see. Hachiko. Hachiko.

06:46.089 --> 06:48.057
Hachiko. Take a picture.

06:52.228 --> 06:54.355
Hachiko.

06:55.531 --> 06:57.123
Like, check it out, Scoob.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.598
Hachiko's not a person, he's a pooch.

06:59.769 --> 07:00.793
Here it is.

07:00.970 --> 07:04.599
Hachiko used to greet his master every
day when he came home on the train.

07:04.774 --> 07:06.071
One day his master died...

07:06.242 --> 07:08.472
...and Hachiko
spent the rest of his life...

07:08.678 --> 07:11.875
...waiting at the station
for his master to return.

07:12.381 --> 07:15.942
Wow, sounds like
he was one cool canine.

07:16.119 --> 07:20.385
Heh, heh. Hey, Scoob. Like, maybe
they'll put up a statue of you some day.

07:20.556 --> 07:22.751
Me? Oh, boy.

07:24.794 --> 07:28.821
Ta-da. Bow-wow. Ruff.

07:29.065 --> 07:31.727
Look at Scooby. What a ham.

07:38.107 --> 07:41.565
- It's going to take more than that.
- Huh?

07:41.744 --> 07:44.178
If you want to have a statue
of your own in Japan...

07:44.347 --> 07:47.077
...you must first become a legend.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.241
Just like Hachiko.

07:49.418 --> 07:51.978
Today, in honor of his great loyalty...

07:52.155 --> 07:57.491
...his statue serves as a special place
for faithful friends to meet.

07:57.660 --> 08:00.185
Uh, I'm sorry, but have we met?

08:00.363 --> 08:02.263
Huh! You must be Miyumi.

08:02.431 --> 08:04.922
And you are Miss Daphne Blake.

08:05.101 --> 08:08.264
I have heard all about you
and the Scooby gang.

08:08.437 --> 08:09.927
What do you know, Scoob?

08:10.106 --> 08:13.633
Looks like our reputation precedes us.

08:13.876 --> 08:16.276
Like, I hope that's a good thing.

08:16.445 --> 08:18.845
Heh-heh-heh. Of course it is.

08:19.015 --> 08:20.482
Can I tell you a secret?

08:20.650 --> 08:24.609
I sometimes wish I could be a member
of the Scooby gang too.

08:24.787 --> 08:25.879
Like, tell you what.

08:26.055 --> 08:30.355
Next time there's a gruesome ghost
up in our grill, you've got first dibs.

08:30.526 --> 08:32.460
Uh-huh.

08:32.628 --> 08:34.323
Hey, don't worry, guys.

08:34.496 --> 08:36.863
We're not here to solve any mysteries
this time.

08:37.033 --> 08:40.799
We're here to watch Daphne compete
in the big martial-arts competition.

08:40.970 --> 08:43.803
I'm so honored
to be invited to the tournament.

08:43.972 --> 08:45.406
And so should you be.

08:45.575 --> 08:50.478
Miss Mirimoto runs the most exclusive
martial-arts academy in all the world.

08:50.646 --> 08:54.047
Only the most exemplary students
are accepted by her.

08:54.217 --> 08:58.381
But first,
you must survive the tournament.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.882
Survive?

09:02.658 --> 09:06.822
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say "survive"?
Ha, ha. I meant "win. "

09:06.996 --> 09:09.055
First, you must win the tournament.

09:24.213 --> 09:25.908
Wow, what a sweet ride.

09:26.082 --> 09:29.279
All it needs
is a groovy green paint job.

09:29.452 --> 09:31.386
Uh, not quite, Freddy.

09:31.554 --> 09:33.613
I can think of one more thing it needs.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.223
Like, how about a pilot?

09:36.392 --> 09:39.122
- Huh?
- Don't worry. We're perfectly safe.

09:39.328 --> 09:44.891
The hover jet is the world's first
fully functioning robotic plane.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.432
That's amazing.

09:46.602 --> 09:48.695
I've studied mechanical engineering...

09:48.871 --> 09:51.305
...but I've never heard
of anything this advanced.

09:51.474 --> 09:54.204
Here in Japan,
technology is taking over everything...

09:54.377 --> 09:57.904
...while many of the old traditions
are fading away.

10:19.902 --> 10:24.464
Please, Miss Mirimoto,
you must believe me.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.905
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.

10:28.077 --> 10:31.843
Soon, he will come
for the Destiny Scroll.

10:35.084 --> 10:39.077
A very entertaining story,
Mr. Takagawa.

10:39.255 --> 10:44.420
I am sure that it will bring
many new visitors to see your exhibit.

10:44.593 --> 10:48.927
Now, as you can see,
our grand tournament is about to begin.

10:49.098 --> 10:52.795
We would be most pleased
to have you join us.

10:52.968 --> 10:59.931
Sojo, please show our honored guest
to his seat.

11:00.109 --> 11:01.633
You must listen.

11:03.713 --> 11:06.045
The scroll...

11:06.515 --> 11:09.848
...must be protected.

11:10.019 --> 11:12.385
I can assure you, Mr. Takagawa...

11:12.555 --> 11:14.216
...ghost or no ghost...

11:14.423 --> 11:19.520
...the Destiny Scroll
will be quite safe behind these walls.

11:19.695 --> 11:22.858
If you say so.

11:23.432 --> 11:26.230
Sojo. Release him.

11:29.739 --> 11:32.173
You must forgive poor Sojo.

11:32.341 --> 11:34.639
He does only as he is told.

11:34.810 --> 11:38.211
His loyalty to me is unquestioned.

11:40.883 --> 11:42.316
The plane.

11:42.485 --> 11:44.510
The plane.

11:51.260 --> 11:54.855
Ah, the last of our guests to arrive.

11:55.030 --> 11:57.760
Have them report
to the staging ground immediately.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.027
We shall have a demonstration.

12:08.344 --> 12:11.211
Wow, what a beautiful airport.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.541
It's not an airport, Freddy.

12:13.716 --> 12:16.549
This is a traditional Japanese garden.

12:19.688 --> 12:23.283
Can't you just feel the peace
and tranquility?

12:27.696 --> 12:29.459
Oh, yeah.

12:29.632 --> 12:33.796
Scoob, old buddy, like, from here on out,
no matter what happens...

12:34.003 --> 12:36.767
...I'm just gonna go with the flow.

12:36.939 --> 12:40.102
Go with the flow.

12:40.309 --> 12:42.800
All must wear uniform.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.971
Gulp! Like, my go-with-the-flow
just got up and went.

12:47.149 --> 12:48.616
Zoinks!

12:55.524 --> 12:57.822
No, Sojo. Bad, Sojo.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.894
Not them. Her.

13:01.063 --> 13:03.554
All must wear uniform.

13:03.732 --> 13:05.461
- Hyah!
- Aah!

13:09.038 --> 13:12.667
Sorry, Sojo,
but I handle my own wardrobe.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.015
Ha-ha-ha. Check it out, Scoob.

13:20.182 --> 13:22.116
Like, it's a carnival of karate.

13:22.284 --> 13:23.979
Ooh! Uh-huh.

13:24.153 --> 13:26.781
The competition this year is fierce.

13:26.956 --> 13:31.484
That's Kerry Kilpatrick,
the Irish national champion.

13:33.462 --> 13:36.454
MIYUMl:
He's a two-fisted demolition dynamo.

13:37.266 --> 13:39.325
Hyah!
MIYUMl: Sapphire Sonja.

13:39.502 --> 13:43.996
The only thing deadlier than her kick
is her beauty.

13:44.673 --> 13:46.334
Rah!
Zoinks!

13:46.575 --> 13:49.874
MIYUMl: And that's Japan's own
Mad Dog Masimoto.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.979
A favorite to win this year.

13:52.147 --> 13:55.378
Once he's off his leash,
you're really in the doghouse.

14:00.990 --> 14:02.218
Huh!

14:16.505 --> 14:17.631
Gee whiz.

14:17.806 --> 14:20.798
Like, talk about a creep
with a canine complex.

14:20.976 --> 14:22.000
Yeah.

14:28.350 --> 14:31.319
Most honored participants...

14:31.487 --> 14:36.720
...welcome to Mirimoto Academy's
Tournament of Champions.

14:36.892 --> 14:39.656
The finest martial artists
in all the world...

14:39.828 --> 14:44.390
...have gathered here today
for one single purpose:

14:44.567 --> 14:48.367
To prove that they are the best.

14:50.773 --> 14:52.741
By this time tomorrow...

14:52.908 --> 14:58.540
...most of you will be sent home
in humiliating defeat.

15:02.017 --> 15:03.678
But there is one among you...

15:03.852 --> 15:07.845
...who has already displayed
the heart of a champion.

15:08.023 --> 15:10.651
Miss Daphne Blake?

15:13.262 --> 15:15.059
Um, over here.

15:15.230 --> 15:16.788
Hello.

15:16.966 --> 15:18.593
Can this be?

15:18.767 --> 15:20.598
The tournament has not yet begun...

15:20.769 --> 15:25.138
...and already you have defeated
the mighty Sojo.

15:25.307 --> 15:28.743
I didn't mean to. It's just that... Eh...

15:28.911 --> 15:30.936
This is most impressive.

15:31.113 --> 15:32.910
Perhaps you would honor us...

15:33.082 --> 15:36.813
...with a demonstration
of your superior skill.

15:36.986 --> 15:39.147
As in right now?

15:39.321 --> 15:43.985
Your opponent will always attack
when you least expect it.

16:14.623 --> 16:15.851
Huh?

16:23.499 --> 16:27.697
Like, meow.
Talk about a kung-fu catfight, ha.

16:27.870 --> 16:29.997
Uh-huh. Meow.

16:51.493 --> 16:54.621
My hair band. I can't see.

16:56.799 --> 16:59.962
Hey, that was a dirty trick.

17:00.135 --> 17:02.399
The first rule of Mirimoto Academy:

17:02.571 --> 17:03.629
If you want to win...

17:03.806 --> 17:07.902
...you must be willing to do
that which others are not willing to do.

17:08.644 --> 17:10.907
Most impressive, Miss Blake.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.741
You lack proper training...

17:12.915 --> 17:17.579
...but I see in you much potential.

17:19.421 --> 17:22.549
The tournament begins tomorrow
at sunrise...

17:22.724 --> 17:27.924
...but tonight,
a feast has been prepared in your honor.

17:30.866 --> 17:31.992
Hear that, Scoob?

17:32.167 --> 17:33.691
Like, a feast in our honor.

17:33.869 --> 17:35.268
Oh, boy.

17:36.672 --> 17:40.608
Finally, something worth fighting for.

18:09.238 --> 18:12.332
Boy, the service here is great...

18:13.342 --> 18:17.108
...but, uh, our waitress
sure could use a suntan.

18:17.279 --> 18:20.407
She's not a waitress, Freddy.
She's a geisha girl.

18:20.582 --> 18:25.076
Geisha, the ancient Japanese tradition
celebrating exquisite beauty.

18:25.254 --> 18:28.087
Speaking of beauty,
check out the buffet table.

18:28.257 --> 18:29.281
Oh, ho, ho!

18:29.458 --> 18:33.417
It's like there's a party in my stomach
and everything's invited.

18:33.595 --> 18:34.619
Yeah.

18:39.601 --> 18:40.727
Hyah!

18:48.076 --> 18:51.477
Ha-ha-ha. Like, you must be
a black belt in kung food.

18:52.881 --> 18:53.905
Yeah.

18:55.584 --> 18:59.748
Forget the karate chop.
Like, check out my karate chomp.

19:03.692 --> 19:05.159
Huh?

19:06.161 --> 19:08.186
Huh! Ninjas!

19:19.107 --> 19:23.544
Wow, real-life ninjas. How cool.

19:23.712 --> 19:25.907
I don't think these guys
are part of the act.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.008
Watch out.

19:30.719 --> 19:32.710
If it's a fight you be looking for...

19:32.921 --> 19:35.481
...then you've found the bloke
to oblige you.

19:40.662 --> 19:41.993
Out of my way.

19:42.164 --> 19:45.656
Let Sapphire Sonja
show you how to kick it.

19:59.581 --> 20:00.639
Hmm?

20:16.765 --> 20:18.096
We're surrounded.

20:34.216 --> 20:35.274
Who's that?

20:35.484 --> 20:38.248
- Gulp! Who cares?
- Not me.

20:40.255 --> 20:41.517
Let's get out of here.

21:47.923 --> 21:49.356
Huh?

21:57.165 --> 21:58.632
Huh?

22:38.974 --> 22:40.407
Yipes!

22:40.609 --> 22:42.873
Like, I almost forgot.

22:43.045 --> 22:45.479
We're afraid of heights.

22:54.723 --> 22:57.692
Shaggy, look.

23:02.197 --> 23:03.926
At long last...

23:04.132 --> 23:09.695
...the Destiny Scroll is mine.

23:12.741 --> 23:15.141
Stop, thief.
- Huh?

23:16.545 --> 23:19.446
You will not be allowed to escape.

23:23.885 --> 23:26.046
You are too late.

23:26.221 --> 23:29.054
We shall let steel decide.

23:45.273 --> 23:46.297
Yipes!

23:58.453 --> 24:01.820
The Black Samurai will live again...

24:01.990 --> 24:04.322
...forever!

24:10.966 --> 24:11.990
So it is true.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.636
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.

24:15.804 --> 24:18.739
Gulp! Ghost?

24:20.408 --> 24:22.000
It just doesn't add up.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.906
The artwork in this collection
must be worth a fortune.

24:25.080 --> 24:28.641
So why go through all that trouble
just to steal one scroll?

24:28.817 --> 24:30.808
Well, gang,
it looks like we've landed...

24:30.986 --> 24:34.149
...smack dab
in the middle of another mystery.

24:34.322 --> 24:36.950
It is no mystery.

24:37.826 --> 24:42.957
The legend of the Black Samurai
has been told for centuries.

24:43.131 --> 24:45.861
May I present Mr. Takagawa...

24:46.034 --> 24:51.233
...most honored curator from
the Tokyo Museum of Cultural History.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.674
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Takagawa.

24:53.842 --> 24:55.366
You'll have to excuse us.

24:55.544 --> 24:58.308
We don't really know much
about Japanese folklore.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.539
But ghosts are kind of our specialty.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.478
Speak for yourself.

25:02.651 --> 25:05.950
My specialty is a triple-decker
Scooby Snack-and-ice-cream...

25:06.121 --> 25:07.645
...with-chocolate-sauce sandwich.

25:07.822 --> 25:09.983
Ha, ha. Mine too.

25:10.158 --> 25:11.182
Yum, yum, yum.

25:11.860 --> 25:14.522
The legend began
hundreds of years ago...

25:14.696 --> 25:18.132
...when fierce warriors
known as the samurai...

25:18.300 --> 25:23.363
...served the warlords of Japan
with absolute loyalty.

25:24.005 --> 25:26.064
<i>The most fearsome of all...</i>

25:26.274 --> 25:29.732
<i>...were the ronin,
the samurai who had lost his master.</i>

25:29.911 --> 25:34.314
<i>Set adrift,
like a wave on the open sea.</i>

25:36.685 --> 25:41.645
<i>One ronin sought out
the master swordmaker Masamune.</i>

25:41.823 --> 25:45.657
<i>The legendary master agreed
to forge the samurai...</i>

25:45.827 --> 25:48.887
<i>...a sword of great mystical power...</i>

25:49.064 --> 25:54.400
<i>...but it would take an entire year
to complete the work.</i>

25:54.569 --> 25:57.936
<i>The master's evil-minded apprentice,
Muramasa...</i>

25:58.106 --> 26:05.035
<i>...offered to forge him another sword,
but in only half the time.</i>

26:12.621 --> 26:14.748
<i>The samurai returned...</i>

26:14.923 --> 26:17.721
<i>...and upon drawing the blade...</i>

26:17.892 --> 26:22.056
<i>...felt a surge of uncontrollable dark power.</i>

26:22.230 --> 26:27.532
<i>The evil spirit of the apprentice
had passed into the blade itself.</i>

26:27.702 --> 26:29.932
<i>It was a sword of hatred.</i>

26:30.105 --> 26:31.970
<i>A sword of darkness.</i>

26:32.140 --> 26:35.200
<i>A Sword of Doom.</i>

26:35.377 --> 26:41.475
<i>And in that moment was born
the Black Samurai.</i>

26:45.487 --> 26:49.389
<i>Finally,
the master's blade was complete.</i>

26:49.557 --> 26:53.152
<i>He named it the Sword of Fate...</i>

26:53.361 --> 26:59.231
<i>...and entrusted its mystical power
to a fearsome green dragon.</i>

26:59.401 --> 27:03.667
<i>Heaven and earth trembled
as the two great swords clashed.</i>

27:08.310 --> 27:11.438
<i>Until, using his sacred magic...</i>

27:11.613 --> 27:15.276
<i>...the Green Dragon
defeated the Black Samurai...</i>

27:15.450 --> 27:20.979
<i>...imprisoning him forever
within the Sword of Doom.</i>

27:21.156 --> 27:25.320
BLACK SAMURAl:
No!

27:26.895 --> 27:33.596
Centuries passed,
and the story faded into legend.

27:33.768 --> 27:37.169
Wow, Mr. Takagawa,
that's some story.

27:38.473 --> 27:42.170
Like, story nothing.
That sounds more like a nightmare.

27:42.344 --> 27:44.312
Yeah.

27:45.180 --> 27:49.116
But what does all of this
have to do with the Destiny Scroll?

27:49.284 --> 27:52.481
The Destiny Scroll
holds the only clue...

27:52.654 --> 27:56.454
...to the secret location
of the Sword of Doom...

27:56.624 --> 28:00.185
...in the form of an ancient riddle.

28:00.362 --> 28:02.956
If the ghost can solve
the riddle of the scroll...

28:03.131 --> 28:05.122
...he will reclaim the Sword of Doom...

28:05.300 --> 28:08.701
...and free his evil spirit.

28:08.870 --> 28:11.338
If only we'd gotten a good look
at that scroll...

28:11.506 --> 28:13.906
...maybe we could have solved
the riddle first.

28:14.075 --> 28:17.408
Yeah, like, too bad the scroll is gone.

28:17.579 --> 28:20.047
Aw, too bad.

28:20.215 --> 28:23.309
Heh-heh-heh.
Guess that's the end of this mystery.

28:23.485 --> 28:27.353
No, my friends,
the mystery has only begun.

28:32.761 --> 28:37.858
Huh! The Destiny Scroll.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.068
So the other scroll was a fake.

28:41.236 --> 28:43.864
Ha, ha. Psyche.

28:44.038 --> 28:48.202
Yes, but the Black Samurai
will soon realize the deception...

28:48.376 --> 28:50.469
...and return.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.040
I will translate the inscription.

28:55.216 --> 29:01.212
"The journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.

29:01.389 --> 29:04.552
The paper dragon shows the way. "

29:04.726 --> 29:07.286
The journey of a thousand miles...

29:07.495 --> 29:10.055
Begins with a single step?

29:10.231 --> 29:13.632
The paper dragon shows the way.

29:13.802 --> 29:15.736
I've got it.

29:15.904 --> 29:17.428
Like, check it out, Scoob.

29:17.605 --> 29:20.870
An origami octopus. Beat that.
Ha-ha-ha.

29:21.042 --> 29:22.509
Hmm...

29:25.814 --> 29:27.805
Look. Snowflakes.

29:31.219 --> 29:36.088
That's it. The paper dragon
must be a reference to origami...

29:36.257 --> 29:38.623
...the Japanese art of folding paper.

29:38.793 --> 29:40.556
Velma's right.

29:40.728 --> 29:46.166
Okay, guys, give us an origami dragon
but this time use the scroll.

29:46.634 --> 29:47.828
No.

29:48.336 --> 29:51.430
Just a little tuck here, a fold there.

29:51.606 --> 29:55.337
This goes under, that goes over.

29:58.146 --> 29:59.408
Ta-da!

30:01.049 --> 30:03.347
The words have been rearranged.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.781
Yes. It now reads:

30:05.954 --> 30:10.618
"The journey begins
with a thousand steps. "

30:10.792 --> 30:13.659
The journey begins
with a thousand steps?

30:13.828 --> 30:15.193
How is that any different?

30:15.363 --> 30:18.662
Hang on, gang.
I think I've got something.

30:18.833 --> 30:21.563
The Temple of a Thousand Steps.

30:22.303 --> 30:23.565
Huh?

30:23.771 --> 30:29.266
An ancient ruin located on a remote
jungle island in the South Pacific Ocean.

30:29.444 --> 30:31.105
Yes. I've got it too.

30:31.279 --> 30:33.679
The island temple is devoted to...

30:35.083 --> 30:37.847
...the Green Dragon.

30:38.019 --> 30:41.455
The Sword of Doom
must be hidden in the temple.

30:41.623 --> 30:45.024
Then we've gotta find a way
to get to that island.

30:45.193 --> 30:47.661
<i>- Sojo, ready the hover jet.
- Hai.</i>

30:47.829 --> 30:53.028
Miyumi will accompany you
on your journey as my representative.

30:53.201 --> 30:55.192
Huh! Thank you, sensei.

30:55.370 --> 31:00.535
Mr. Takagawa, you will go along
as the team's translation expert.

31:00.708 --> 31:03.973
I will serve with distinction.

31:04.145 --> 31:07.012
A tropical-island vacation
in the sunny South Pacific?

31:08.616 --> 31:10.709
Like, now you're speaking
our language.

31:10.885 --> 31:12.352
Uh-huh.

31:21.229 --> 31:22.924
We should be getting close.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.929
I've uploaded the coordinates
into the navigation system...

31:26.134 --> 31:28.898
...using my laptop's
wireless interface.

31:29.370 --> 31:32.339
It's very exciting for me
to join you on this mystery.

31:32.507 --> 31:35.670
I'm usually not allowed
to venture so far from Miss Mirimoto.

31:35.843 --> 31:38.676
She seems like a really great sensei.

31:38.846 --> 31:39.870
She is...

31:40.048 --> 31:43.779
...but she demands absolute loyalty,
like that of a samurai.

31:43.952 --> 31:45.010
Indeed.

31:45.186 --> 31:48.519
Someone who still cares
for the old ways.

31:48.690 --> 31:50.920
Yeah, like, the good old days...

31:51.092 --> 31:54.027
...when people chased each other around
with big swords.

31:54.195 --> 31:58.291
Pardon my saying so,
but that puts the mental in sentimental.

31:58.466 --> 31:59.933
Uh-huh.

32:04.539 --> 32:05.699
Here we go, gang.

32:11.379 --> 32:13.108
I can't see anything.

32:13.281 --> 32:16.216
It's like the whole world
just disappeared.

32:16.384 --> 32:20.718
Zoinks! Like, so much
for our sunny South Pacific vacation.

32:20.888 --> 32:23.948
The island should be right
in front of us.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.125
Whoa!

32:34.068 --> 32:35.968
Look, gang. There it is.

32:36.404 --> 32:39.999
The Temple of a Thousand Steps.

32:42.777 --> 32:45.109
Nine hundred and ninety-seven.

32:45.279 --> 32:47.509
Nine hundred and ninety-eight.

32:47.715 --> 32:49.979
Nine hundred and ninety-nine.

32:50.718 --> 32:52.083
One thousand.

32:52.253 --> 32:54.278
Phew! We made it, Scoob.

32:55.657 --> 32:59.115
Like, in your face,
Temple of a Thousand Steps.

32:59.293 --> 33:02.456
<i>Thousand Steps.</i>

33:02.664 --> 33:04.791
Yeah.

33:04.966 --> 33:09.426
Scooby-Dooby... I'm pooped.

33:09.604 --> 33:11.196
We made it, gang.

33:11.372 --> 33:14.671
And check out that
stone carving above the temple door.

33:16.110 --> 33:18.340
The Green Dragon.

33:23.518 --> 33:26.146
Check out the size of that disco ball.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.981
That's no disco ball, Shaggy.

33:28.156 --> 33:30.056
It's a Japanese lantern.

33:30.258 --> 33:33.887
Hey, maybe that's got something to do
with the next clue.

33:34.062 --> 33:39.227
Or maybe we should just say we tried
and, like, call it a day.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.061
Zoinks!

33:52.213 --> 33:53.237
Jinkies.

33:53.414 --> 33:56.383
- Shaggy, you did it.
- I did?

33:56.551 --> 33:58.519
I mean, I did.

33:59.887 --> 34:01.821
Like, what did I do, Scoob?

34:01.989 --> 34:03.684
I don't know.

34:03.858 --> 34:06.588
It looks like some kind of treasure map.

34:06.794 --> 34:09.262
Showing the whole island.

34:09.429 --> 34:11.364
Is that the Sword of Doom?

34:11.532 --> 34:14.763
Huh! Yes, it must be.

34:14.936 --> 34:17.370
But it's on the other side of the island.

34:17.538 --> 34:20.029
I will translate the inscription.

34:20.208 --> 34:25.612
"The secret falls
from the mouth of the dragon. "

34:25.813 --> 34:27.371
Another dragon riddle?

34:27.547 --> 34:29.208
Uh, speaking of riddles...

34:29.382 --> 34:33.820
...like, does this mean
there's a cafeteria on this island?

34:40.393 --> 34:43.123
No. We must get out of here.

34:44.532 --> 34:46.295
Like, why?

34:48.136 --> 34:50.263
Hurry, before they catch us.

35:08.923 --> 35:10.788
Okay, everybody just stay calm...

35:10.958 --> 35:12.482
...and let me do all the talking.

35:14.562 --> 35:16.325
Hello there. Heh.

35:16.497 --> 35:18.897
We're from America.

35:21.869 --> 35:25.669
Like, how do we get ourselves
into these things?

35:28.075 --> 35:31.169
<i>...Droo-ga-ga.</i>

35:31.946 --> 35:35.643
<i>Droo-ga-ga. Droo-ga-ga.</i>

35:35.883 --> 35:37.350
"Droo-ga-ga"?

35:37.518 --> 35:40.510
It must be their name
for the Green Dragon.

35:40.688 --> 35:43.486
They are going to offer us
as a sacrifice.

35:45.893 --> 35:50.023
And I think we're going to be married
to that icky tribal chief.

35:54.902 --> 35:56.130
Ew.

35:56.304 --> 35:57.464
Not if I can help it.

35:57.638 --> 35:59.799
Miyumi, if you can reach my bag...

35:59.974 --> 36:02.636
...I've got a plan to save all our skins.

36:02.810 --> 36:04.300
Okay.

36:19.994 --> 36:22.519
Boy, you guys really know
how to cook...

36:24.332 --> 36:27.062
...hmm, but there's something
still missing.

36:28.069 --> 36:29.502
Huh?

36:35.643 --> 36:38.669
Mmm. Hey, now that's more like it.

36:39.180 --> 36:41.512
Here, taste.

36:47.321 --> 36:51.849
Well, what are you waiting for?
Come on in, the water's fine.

36:53.694 --> 36:56.094
Like, now we're cooking.
Right, Scoob?

36:56.264 --> 36:57.322
Yeah.

37:09.243 --> 37:12.679
I mean, mmm! Yummy.

37:12.847 --> 37:15.338
Okay, that should do it.

37:15.516 --> 37:18.781
Now, just cover and simmer
for one hour.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.613
Huh?

37:27.395 --> 37:28.521
Zoinks!

37:28.729 --> 37:32.028
Ha, ha. That's the problem
with gourmet cooking nowadays.

37:32.199 --> 37:34.997
Like, everyone's a critic.

37:39.373 --> 37:42.240
<i>Huh! Droo-ga-ga!</i>

37:53.054 --> 37:55.045
Huh! You did it, Velma.

37:55.222 --> 37:57.281
Lucky for us
the plane's robotic navigator...

37:57.458 --> 37:59.722
...is still connected
to my wireless interface.

37:59.894 --> 38:02.795
The villagers must think
the hover jet is the Green Dragon.

38:02.964 --> 38:05.262
So, like, what are we dragging
our feet for?

38:05.433 --> 38:06.661
Come on.

38:31.359 --> 38:34.294
Look, how magnificent.

38:34.628 --> 38:38.189
The secret falls
from the mouth of the dragon.

38:38.366 --> 38:42.166
MIYUMl:
The riddle is pointing to the waterfall.

38:42.336 --> 38:44.770
So, like, what do we do next?

38:45.306 --> 38:47.706
We go in for a closer look.

38:47.875 --> 38:51.606
Like, I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.332
Weird.
Check it out.

39:17.238 --> 39:18.296
Huh?

39:25.146 --> 39:26.170
Come on, Scoob.

39:26.347 --> 39:28.178
There's nothing to be afraid of.

39:28.349 --> 39:29.373
Yeah, see?

39:29.550 --> 39:31.916
Like, they're only statues.

39:32.119 --> 39:34.485
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh!

39:34.688 --> 39:37.179
Would you come with us
for a Scooby Snack?

39:38.659 --> 39:40.422
Nope.

39:40.628 --> 39:43.426
Would you do it
for two Scooby Snacks?

39:43.631 --> 39:45.064
Uh-uh.

39:45.266 --> 39:47.097
How about 10 Scooby Snacks?

39:49.937 --> 39:52.132
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:53.774 --> 39:56.265
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

40:01.515 --> 40:04.575
Wow, look at this place.

40:05.352 --> 40:07.946
We've found it at last.

40:08.155 --> 40:11.886
The Sword of Doom.

40:15.429 --> 40:17.727
So, like, what are we waiting for?

40:17.898 --> 40:21.299
Let's grab the sword
and blow this pop stand.

40:21.469 --> 40:23.369
Uh-huh.

40:23.571 --> 40:25.061
I don't know, guys.

40:25.606 --> 40:28.803
Something doesn't feel right
about this.

40:28.976 --> 40:33.310
But Miss Mirimoto is expecting us
to bring the sword back to Japan.

40:34.782 --> 40:36.443
If you want to win...

40:36.617 --> 40:40.986
...you must be willing to do that
which others are not willing to do.

40:47.428 --> 40:49.089
Zoinks! That did it.

40:56.070 --> 40:58.698
Run for it!

41:19.093 --> 41:21.323
Huh? Yikes!

41:24.265 --> 41:26.256
Foolish mortals.

41:26.800 --> 41:33.330
Return the sword to me
and I shall destroy you quickly.

41:33.507 --> 41:36.271
Return the sword and be destroyed?

41:37.645 --> 41:40.341
Like, I'd hate to hear
option number two.

42:35.369 --> 42:36.836
Hey!
Oof!

42:37.671 --> 42:38.865
My glasses.

42:39.039 --> 42:42.031
Oh, I can't see a thing
without my glasses.

42:43.410 --> 42:46.743
That's funny,
I can't see a thing with your glasses.

42:52.586 --> 42:54.053
Zoinks!

42:58.759 --> 43:00.420
Run!

43:07.368 --> 43:08.835
Huh?

43:12.406 --> 43:13.873
Sojo?

43:19.546 --> 43:21.571
It's all very simple.

43:21.749 --> 43:25.378
Sojo has been behind
these samurai shenanigans all along.

43:25.552 --> 43:28.453
He stole the Black Samurai's armor
from the museum.

43:28.622 --> 43:33.218
And he used this high-tech mini jetpack
to fly around like a real live ghost.

43:33.394 --> 43:35.555
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

43:37.731 --> 43:40.928
Sojo's master plan was to bring
the legend of the Black Samurai to life...

43:41.101 --> 43:43.592
...and scare everyone away
from the tournament.

43:44.938 --> 43:47.099
<i>That way he could steal
the Destiny Scroll...</i>

43:47.274 --> 43:50.732
<i>...then search for the Sword of Doom
on his own.</i>

43:53.314 --> 43:55.145
Once we set out
to solve the mystery...

43:55.316 --> 43:58.444
...his only hope was to steal
the sword from us.

43:58.619 --> 44:01.247
Like, talk about a sneaky samurai.

44:01.422 --> 44:04.619
Yeah, sneaky.

44:04.792 --> 44:05.850
Yes.

44:06.026 --> 44:08.119
And he would have gotten away
with it too...

44:08.295 --> 44:10.763
...if it weren't for you meddling kids.

44:10.931 --> 44:12.193
Sojo!

44:20.641 --> 44:22.268
- Zoinks!
- Yikes!

44:22.443 --> 44:25.344
- Jeepers!
- Jinkies!

44:26.280 --> 44:29.545
Dang, I still don't have a catch phrase.

44:29.717 --> 44:31.344
We must protect the sword.

44:35.556 --> 44:37.490
Huh! They're robots.

44:37.658 --> 44:39.023
Ninja robots!

44:39.193 --> 44:40.490
Double cool!

44:40.661 --> 44:43.221
Uh, sorry, I...
I geeked out there for a sec.

44:43.430 --> 44:46.160
So, like, the ninjas
were your own robots?

44:46.333 --> 44:48.824
Huh? I don't get it.

44:51.071 --> 44:53.335
The tournament was just an excuse...

44:53.507 --> 44:58.069
...to gather the greatest martial artists
from around the world.

45:04.251 --> 45:05.843
<i>Using computer analysis...</i>

45:06.019 --> 45:10.012
<i>...their various fighting styles
were digitized...</i>

45:10.190 --> 45:12.715
<i>...into my ninja robots.</i>

45:14.061 --> 45:17.155
After that, all I needed
was to find someone...

45:17.331 --> 45:20.357
...who could solve
the riddle of the Destiny Scroll.

45:20.534 --> 45:24.595
And who better than the world's
greatest teenage detectives?

45:24.772 --> 45:26.000
Come on, Miyumi.

45:26.173 --> 45:28.505
We can fight them together.

45:29.243 --> 45:30.710
Miyumi?

45:30.878 --> 45:33.870
Huh! You're one of them.

45:34.047 --> 45:38.177
I'm sorry,
but I must remain loyal to my sensei.

45:38.352 --> 45:40.582
Tomorrow night,
when the moon is full...

45:40.754 --> 45:44.690
...I will resurrect the Black Samurai
from the Sword of Doom.

45:44.858 --> 45:50.023
Once I have freed his spirit,
he will call me master.

45:50.731 --> 45:51.755
No.

45:51.932 --> 45:53.422
This is madness.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.693
Once the Black Samurai
has returned...

45:55.869 --> 45:58.463
...I will order him
to lead my robot ninjas...

45:58.639 --> 46:01.972
...against the ignorant forces
of this modern age.

46:02.142 --> 46:04.610
Then the ancient world
of the samurai...

46:04.778 --> 46:06.905
...and the new world of technology...

46:07.080 --> 46:11.449
...shall exist in perfect harmony.

46:11.618 --> 46:14.553
- Oh.
- Hmm, it could work.

46:14.721 --> 46:18.054
- Miyumi, did you know about this?
- No.

46:18.225 --> 46:20.591
My only instructions
were to earn your trust...

46:20.761 --> 46:22.956
...by becoming your friend.

46:23.130 --> 46:25.928
The first rule of Mirimoto Academy.

46:26.099 --> 46:27.760
If you want to win...

46:27.935 --> 46:32.998
...you must be willing to do that
which others are not willing to do.

46:33.173 --> 46:35.801
But if you do things
that a winner wouldn't do...

46:35.976 --> 46:38.467
...that automatically
makes you a loser.

46:38.645 --> 46:40.237
Hyah!

46:41.114 --> 46:42.581
Huh?

46:42.916 --> 46:44.781
- Zoinks!
- Uh-oh!

46:45.152 --> 46:46.483
Whoa!

46:53.460 --> 46:56.861
Like, all aboard
the Samurai Sword Express.

46:57.064 --> 46:59.191
Shaggy and Scooby got away.

46:59.366 --> 47:03.462
But you will not be so fortunate.

47:05.072 --> 47:07.370
Miyumi, Sojo, come.

47:07.574 --> 47:10.134
I hope you will enjoy your new role...

47:10.310 --> 47:15.145
...as part of the museum's
permanent collection.

47:57.691 --> 47:59.056
Shaggy?

48:16.276 --> 48:17.743
Zoinks!

48:21.949 --> 48:24.577
Way to go, Scoob.
I think we lost them.

48:24.751 --> 48:26.412
Huh?

48:26.653 --> 48:30.453
Gulp! Speaking of losing,
like, we're losing altitude.

48:34.061 --> 48:35.961
Ungh!
Phew.

48:37.531 --> 48:38.964
Huh?

48:54.414 --> 48:58.077
Welcome to Green Dragon Sushi.
You sit.

48:58.251 --> 49:01.084
Eat sushi. Good for you, eh?

49:01.254 --> 49:04.314
Like, you got anything back there
without a head on it?

49:06.994 --> 49:09.224
Ew.

49:09.429 --> 49:12.262
You like miso soup?

49:12.432 --> 49:15.333
Miso soup? Sounds perfect. Ha, ha.

49:15.502 --> 49:17.333
Like, me so hungry.

49:17.504 --> 49:21.099
Yeah. Me so hungry too.

49:25.212 --> 49:28.443
Ah! Like, that really hit the spot.

49:28.615 --> 49:30.446
Yum, yum.

49:32.486 --> 49:35.944
I am Matsuhiro.

49:36.123 --> 49:37.454
Menu?

49:38.225 --> 49:39.852
Hey, check it out, Scoob.

49:40.027 --> 49:43.656
Like, it's our old friend,
the Green Dragon.

49:43.830 --> 49:47.664
Ah! So you know the legend.

49:48.669 --> 49:50.261
You could say that.

49:50.437 --> 49:52.632
Do you know what I like most
about legends?

49:52.806 --> 49:56.333
New chapters are being written
all the time.

49:57.778 --> 49:59.803
You never know
what is going to happen next.

50:05.485 --> 50:06.747
Zoinks!
Yipes!

50:06.953 --> 50:11.117
Gulp! Like, Sword of Doom,
don't fail us now.

50:11.291 --> 50:14.385
Eh? The Sword of Doom?

50:14.561 --> 50:16.153
But how?

50:16.329 --> 50:17.660
Like, we'll tell you later.

50:17.831 --> 50:21.824
Right now, we've got a serious case
of the robot ninjas.

50:22.002 --> 50:23.867
Robot ninjas?

50:27.507 --> 50:29.338
Hyah!

50:29.543 --> 50:32.137
Now we will have some fun.

50:46.860 --> 50:50.387
No! The Sword of Doom.

50:55.669 --> 50:57.364
They are gone.

50:57.537 --> 50:59.869
Gee whiz, for a sushi chef...

51:00.040 --> 51:03.032
...you're no cold fish
with a samurai sword.

51:03.210 --> 51:08.580
That is because I am samurai.

51:16.022 --> 51:19.924
Give it up, Freddy.
Those doors must be 3 feet thick.

51:21.728 --> 51:23.355
We gotta get out of here somehow.

51:23.530 --> 51:26.260
I'll chop away all night if I have to.

51:28.135 --> 51:30.763
We do not have all night.

51:32.372 --> 51:36.035
I should not have been so critical
of this modern age.

51:36.643 --> 51:39.237
If only I had one more chance...

51:39.412 --> 51:45.408
...I would fight to save this world
like a modern-day samurai.

51:46.787 --> 51:47.811
Huh?

51:59.399 --> 52:02.891
You've freed us, Kenji. You're a hero.

52:04.871 --> 52:06.600
Takagawa san?

52:06.773 --> 52:09.071
Why did you lock yourself
in the vault?

52:09.242 --> 52:11.005
There is no time to explain.

52:12.412 --> 52:17.679
There will be more than one samurai
brought back to life.

52:21.421 --> 52:25.448
How could we let those rotten robots
take the Sword of Doom?

52:25.625 --> 52:27.149
What are we gonna do now?

52:28.528 --> 52:29.586
I don't know.

52:29.796 --> 52:31.787
Look there.

52:31.965 --> 52:35.025
The great mountain, Fuji san.

52:35.202 --> 52:41.038
Sacred training ground
for generations of samurai.

52:41.208 --> 52:42.505
Samurai?

52:42.676 --> 52:46.112
But, like, we don't know anything
about being samurai warriors.

52:46.279 --> 52:47.610
Mm-mm.

52:49.282 --> 52:50.715
Do not be afraid.

52:50.917 --> 52:54.182
A samurai must overcome his fear.

52:54.354 --> 52:55.878
When fear is gone...

52:56.056 --> 52:58.650
...the mind will be empty.

53:00.060 --> 53:01.994
Ha, ha. Like, an empty mind?

53:02.162 --> 53:04.562
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Ha-ha-ha.

53:04.731 --> 53:06.892
Now, that's something
I've got already.

53:07.067 --> 53:09.035
Uh-huh. Me too.

53:09.936 --> 53:11.699
The samurai never hesitates.

53:11.872 --> 53:14.534
He acts, he fights, he wins.

53:14.708 --> 53:18.303
Without fear, without anger,
without mind.

53:18.478 --> 53:20.412
And without lunch breaks.

53:20.580 --> 53:24.380
Like, I'm ready to trade in
this samurai sword for a shish kebab.

53:24.551 --> 53:27.577
Oh, shish kebab.

53:27.754 --> 53:29.847
Yum, yum.

53:35.896 --> 53:38.524
That's it, Scoob. We did it.

53:41.902 --> 53:43.563
<i>Well done, tomodachi.</i>

53:43.737 --> 53:45.602
You are ready to begin.

53:45.772 --> 53:48.036
Gulp! Begin?

53:48.208 --> 53:50.199
The last chapter has ended.

53:50.377 --> 53:53.972
The next is yet to be written.

53:57.884 --> 54:00.352
These are the four gates:

54:00.887 --> 54:03.082
Earth, Air...

54:03.256 --> 54:05.588
...Fire and Water.

54:05.759 --> 54:08.626
Passing through each,
you will be purified.

54:08.795 --> 54:11.855
You have already found
the Gate of Earth.

54:12.032 --> 54:13.260
Huh?

54:13.500 --> 54:17.800
All you must do now is pass through.

54:19.406 --> 54:21.397
Ha, ha. Like, that was easy.

54:21.574 --> 54:23.439
The journey has begun.

54:23.610 --> 54:27.307
There can be no going back now.

54:27.514 --> 54:29.744
Okay. Like, where to next?

54:29.916 --> 54:32.214
The legend tells of two swords...

54:32.385 --> 54:36.719
...the Sword of Doom
and the Sword of Fate.

54:37.257 --> 54:42.058
Pass beyond the four gates
to the lair of the Green Dragon.

54:42.228 --> 54:44.992
Wake him from his ancient slumber...

54:45.165 --> 54:48.225
...and seize the Sword of Fate.

54:48.401 --> 54:52.770
Gulp! Like, any chance you'd throw in
a couple of Scooby Snacks for the road?

54:54.341 --> 54:56.775
Like, Scoob, old buddy...

54:56.943 --> 55:00.435
...remind me again
how we got talked into this.

55:00.613 --> 55:04.174
I don't remember.

55:05.819 --> 55:07.684
There it is.

55:07.854 --> 55:09.617
That must be the Gate of Air.

55:10.991 --> 55:13.960
Like, last one there
is a rotten samurai.

55:18.465 --> 55:20.490
Ha, ha. We made it.

55:20.667 --> 55:22.134
Huh?

55:22.335 --> 55:23.359
Yipes!

55:23.603 --> 55:28.836
Gulp! Like, whatever you do, Scoob,
don't look down.

55:29.009 --> 55:30.476
Yikes!

55:40.620 --> 55:43.612
Phew! Like, that was a close one.

55:43.790 --> 55:44.814
Huh?

55:57.370 --> 55:59.895
Like, check us out, Scoob.
We're hanging 10.

56:00.106 --> 56:03.701
Gulp! Ten thousand degrees Fahrenheit,
that is.

56:08.148 --> 56:11.117
There it is, Scoob. The Gate of Fire.

56:20.226 --> 56:22.319
Whoa!

56:30.170 --> 56:31.865
The Gate of Water.

56:32.038 --> 56:33.096
Water.

56:40.513 --> 56:41.537
Huh?
Ooh!

56:42.148 --> 56:43.615
We made it, Scoob.

56:43.783 --> 56:46.911
This must be the Green Dragon's
groovy grotto.

56:47.087 --> 56:51.751
Like, not bad for a mystical dragon
who probably doesn't even exist.

56:51.925 --> 56:57.056
Who dares enter my sacred grove?

56:57.430 --> 57:01.764
Be ye samurai?

57:02.702 --> 57:05.899
You bet. Like, I'm Shogun Shaggy...

57:06.072 --> 57:10.236
...and this is my faithful companion,
Samurai Scooby-Doo.

57:10.410 --> 57:12.139
Gulp! Hello.

57:12.312 --> 57:16.578
O Great Green One,
we come bearing rotten news.

57:16.749 --> 57:21.777
The Sword of Doom is back
and the Black Samurai is on the attack.

57:25.258 --> 57:27.556
Impossible.

57:29.462 --> 57:33.398
Ages ago,
the Sword of Doom was hidden away...

57:33.566 --> 57:39.095
...protected by guardians of stone,
high atop a secret mountain...

57:39.272 --> 57:45.302
...on a savage island surrounded
by an impenetrable fog.

57:49.482 --> 57:51.677
Yeah, funny story about that.

57:55.455 --> 57:59.448
But, like, that's all ancient history.
Tonight, the modern world is in danger...

57:59.626 --> 58:01.457
...and we need your help.

58:02.095 --> 58:05.622
There is no place left
in the world for dragons.

58:08.768 --> 58:09.792
What are you?

58:09.969 --> 58:14.497
A big green dragon
afraid of a little sword fight?

58:19.112 --> 58:22.946
You don't look like samurai.

58:27.187 --> 58:29.155
- Tell him, Shaggy.
- Gulp!

58:29.322 --> 58:30.687
Like, the truth is...

58:38.831 --> 58:41.391
That's better.

58:41.834 --> 58:42.994
Like, wow. Ha, ha.

58:43.169 --> 58:47.367
Check it out, Scoob.
We're rolling old-school, samurai-style.

58:47.540 --> 58:50.168
Yeah, old-school.

58:51.911 --> 58:55.540
For centuries,
I have guarded the Sword of Fate...

58:55.715 --> 58:59.173
...awaiting the day when its service
would again be needed.

58:59.352 --> 59:02.788
That day has finally come.

59:08.161 --> 59:13.258
The legend must end
where it all began.

59:13.433 --> 59:16.834
Like, up, up and away we go.

59:17.003 --> 59:19.062
Whee!

59:29.882 --> 59:31.247
Sojo, come.

59:31.417 --> 59:32.907
It is time.

59:43.763 --> 59:48.757
The Destiny Scroll
still holds one last secret.

59:51.571 --> 59:53.698
"Standing on the bridge of his defeat...

59:53.873 --> 59:57.206
...hold the Sword of Doom
to the rising full moon.

59:57.377 --> 59:59.538
The spell will be broken...

59:59.712 --> 01:00:02.237
...and the spirit of the Black Samurai...

01:00:02.415 --> 01:00:05.782
...shall be set free. "

01:00:06.386 --> 01:00:09.822
Sojo, walk to the bridge.

01:00:09.989 --> 01:00:13.220
Sojo walk to bridge.

01:00:16.396 --> 01:00:19.456
Miyumi, do not fail me this night.

01:00:19.632 --> 01:00:23.898
Your loyalty shall be rewarded
in the coming new world.

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:26.368
Yes, sensei.

01:00:32.679 --> 01:00:34.237
Okay, gang, get ready.

01:00:34.781 --> 01:00:37.773
I can't believe Miyumi's
really going through with this.

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:41.647
Ohh! With friends like her,
who needs enemies?

01:00:45.425 --> 01:00:48.519
Miyumi, sword.

01:00:48.695 --> 01:00:50.526
Huh? Huh?

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.794
The treacherous little fool. Ugh!

01:00:56.969 --> 01:00:59.665
Yahoo! Way to go, Miyumi.

01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:01.670
I knew you were one of us.

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:06.835
- Oops!
- Now, Velma.

01:01:07.413 --> 01:01:08.539
Hit it, Kenji.

01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:20.054
Magnetic pulse away.

01:01:27.133 --> 01:01:31.035
The magnetic pulse is
knocking out their electrical systems.

01:01:33.306 --> 01:01:35.035
It worked.

01:01:55.161 --> 01:01:58.562
Hmm. Maybe it worked
a little too well.

01:02:02.535 --> 01:02:04.093
Ungrateful child.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:09.435
I was blinded by my loyalty to you,
but now I can see clearly.

01:02:09.609 --> 01:02:12.772
How dare you disobey me?

01:02:21.387 --> 01:02:22.854
Huh! The sword!

01:02:26.259 --> 01:02:28.124
<i>Bansai!</i>

01:02:57.323 --> 01:03:02.818
The Black Samurai lives again.

01:03:06.766 --> 01:03:08.063
No, samurai.

01:03:08.234 --> 01:03:09.997
I am the master here.

01:03:10.169 --> 01:03:12.103
Bow before me...

01:03:12.271 --> 01:03:15.263
...and I will give you the world.

01:03:18.478 --> 01:03:20.639
Foolish one.

01:03:24.584 --> 01:03:29.317
It is you who shall call me master.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:38.058
Bow before me, mortals.

01:03:39.765 --> 01:03:41.824
Unh!
Unh! Whoa!

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.470
KENJl: Unh!
Unh! Whoa!

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:53.808
All shall serve me...

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.710
...forever!

01:04:00.987 --> 01:04:02.978
Shaggy, look.

01:04:08.461 --> 01:04:13.489
At last, freedom is mine.

01:04:13.666 --> 01:04:15.896
Oh, no. Like, we're too late.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.160
Fear not.

01:04:17.336 --> 01:04:20.499
Shogun Shaggy, Samurai Scooby...

01:04:20.673 --> 01:04:23.233
...you must carry on the fight.

01:04:23.409 --> 01:04:25.809
Unsheathe the Sword of Fate...

01:04:25.978 --> 01:04:29.880
...so that my spirit
may enter the blade.

01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:32.847
I shall be with you always...

01:04:33.019 --> 01:04:38.047
...guiding the sword from within.

01:04:49.035 --> 01:04:50.525
Guys, look.

01:04:50.703 --> 01:04:52.568
Huh! It's Shaggy and Scooby.

01:04:52.738 --> 01:04:54.228
Ow! My neck.

01:04:55.675 --> 01:04:58.735
Like, right on time, late as usual.

01:05:10.089 --> 01:05:14.890
Who dares challenge
the Black Samurai?

01:05:15.061 --> 01:05:17.222
Zoinks! Like, here we go, Scoob.

01:05:17.396 --> 01:05:20.126
Remember what they taught us
in samurai school.

01:05:20.299 --> 01:05:23.234
Uh... Uh, I forgot.

01:05:32.244 --> 01:05:33.973
Huh?

01:05:34.747 --> 01:05:37.477
The Sword of Fate?

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:39.911
Impossible.

01:05:40.086 --> 01:05:41.883
Like, you think that's impossible...

01:05:42.054 --> 01:05:45.490
...try flying into Tokyo
on a green dragon sometime.

01:06:32.338 --> 01:06:33.737
Hyah!

01:06:47.186 --> 01:06:50.019
Fools. You are no match for me.

01:06:52.692 --> 01:06:54.455
Aah!
Yipes!

01:06:57.563 --> 01:07:01.021
A samurai must overcome his fear.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:06.638
When fear is gone,
the mind will be empty.

01:07:06.806 --> 01:07:08.706
Like, did you hear that, Scoob?

01:07:08.874 --> 01:07:11.172
Yeah, I did.

01:07:11.343 --> 01:07:13.834
It's that sushi sword master,
Matsuhiro.

01:07:14.013 --> 01:07:15.207
He's in my head.

01:07:15.381 --> 01:07:17.508
No, I'm not. I'm over here.

01:07:17.683 --> 01:07:20.846
The samurai acts without anger.

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.682
He fights without mind.

01:07:28.561 --> 01:07:29.653
Yikes!

01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:31.820
Don't think, Scoob. Just let it go.

01:07:31.997 --> 01:07:34.022
Like, no mind.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.327
Oh, yeah.

01:07:37.703 --> 01:07:43.198
The Sword of Doom
shall be your destroyer.

01:07:53.219 --> 01:07:54.743
Hyah!

01:07:58.557 --> 01:08:02.823
No!

01:08:16.274 --> 01:08:19.971
Ha, ha. Like, that psychotic samurai
forgot one thing.

01:08:20.145 --> 01:08:23.444
When it comes to no mind,
we've got everybody beat.

01:08:23.616 --> 01:08:25.584
Like, our minds are always empty.

01:08:25.751 --> 01:08:27.412
Yeah.

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:32.622
Scooby, Shaggy, that was amazing.

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:37.920
Huh?

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:47.403
Like, it's just a little old man.

01:08:47.573 --> 01:08:48.938
Thank you...

01:08:49.108 --> 01:08:52.737
...most honored friends.

01:08:52.912 --> 01:08:54.970
You have released my spirit...

01:08:55.147 --> 01:08:59.584
...from the evil power
of that cursed sword...

01:08:59.752 --> 01:09:02.618
...and saved your world.

01:09:02.787 --> 01:09:07.747
I shall be eternally grateful.

01:09:07.926 --> 01:09:11.761
You are indeed samurai...

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:15.423
...and your legend shall be told...

01:09:16.135 --> 01:09:18.831
...forever.

01:09:22.274 --> 01:09:23.332
Wow.

01:09:23.509 --> 01:09:24.942
He disappeared.

01:09:25.109 --> 01:09:26.941
Well, you gotta hand it to him.

01:09:27.112 --> 01:09:29.944
He went out in real samurai-style.

01:09:32.184 --> 01:09:33.515
Congratulations...

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.688
...samurai.

01:09:37.456 --> 01:09:41.893
The last chapter of the legend
has finally been written...

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.723
...by you.

01:09:46.932 --> 01:09:48.365
<i>Welcome to...</i>

01:09:48.533 --> 01:09:50.661
<i>...the new Tokyo Museum
of Cultural History...</i>

01:09:50.836 --> 01:09:54.567
<i>...and the grand opening
of our most legendary exhibit...</i>

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:59.074
<i>...the ghost of the Black Samurai.</i>

01:09:59.712 --> 01:10:03.148
And so,
it is with great honor that I present...

01:10:03.315 --> 01:10:08.753
...for loyal service to his friends,
to Japan and to all the world...

01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:11.388
...this statue...

01:10:11.657 --> 01:10:15.753
...in honor of Scooby-Doo.

01:10:20.866 --> 01:10:23.892
<i>Droo-ga-ga. Droo-ga-ga.</i>

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:30.533
Scoob, you really did get
your own statue.

01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:33.371
Ha, ha. And, like,
they even got your good side.

01:10:33.545 --> 01:10:34.773
Yeah.

01:10:36.181 --> 01:10:39.014
MIYUMl:
Ha, ha. Congratulations, Scooby.

01:10:39.785 --> 01:10:43.619
Now Japan will remember you forever.

01:10:43.789 --> 01:10:46.280
Are you sure
you won't come with us, Miyumi?

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:49.052
There's bound to be other mysteries
that need solving.

01:10:49.228 --> 01:10:51.890
And there's always room for one more
in the Mystery Machine.

01:10:52.064 --> 01:10:54.760
Yeah, like, you could sit
in the back with me and Scooby.

01:10:54.934 --> 01:10:56.993
Yeah, sit with me.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.130
You're all very sweet...

01:10:59.305 --> 01:11:01.466
...but solving mysteries
is what you do best.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.803
Now I need to figure out
what it is that I do best.

01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:06.238
Then maybe someday...

01:11:06.412 --> 01:11:09.108
...I will have what it takes
to become a legend too.

01:11:09.281 --> 01:11:11.078
Just like you, Scooby.

01:11:13.085 --> 01:11:14.609
Aw...

01:11:22.428 --> 01:11:24.487
Heh, heh. Oh, brother.

01:11:24.663 --> 01:11:25.891
This could take a while.

01:11:27.266 --> 01:11:30.599
We may just have to leave Scooby here
and take the statue home.

01:11:36.108 --> 01:11:40.408
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
