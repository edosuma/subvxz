WEBVTT

00:00.302 --> 00:02.469
<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on</i> The Bastard Executioner...

00:02.503 --> 00:03.804
At this very moment,

00:03.838 --> 00:06.039
our king is deciding the fate
of Ventrishire.

00:06.074 --> 00:07.808
But I must ask that

00:07.842 --> 00:09.476
you allow me to give counsel

00:09.510 --> 00:12.678
before making decisions that
could lead to deep regret.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.247
The baron
always gave me his ear.

00:14.281 --> 00:16.315
I am not my husband.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.284
Where's the baroness?

00:18.318 --> 00:20.853
- Regretfully, on her way to Windsor.
- She's the one

00:20.888 --> 00:22.288
who pleaded for this visit.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.590
As you know,
when His Majesty calls, all...

00:24.624 --> 00:27.026
must answer.
She left but yesterday.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.794
Welcome.

00:28.828 --> 00:30.395
Piers Gaveston.

00:30.429 --> 00:33.131
Trusted advisor to His Majesty,
King Edward the Second.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.601
The king has requested that you
join him for his midday meal.

00:36.635 --> 00:40.038
He is most eager to discuss
the future of Ventrishire.

00:40.072 --> 00:43.274
The rule is in the hands
of a frivolous king.

00:43.309 --> 00:44.942
There are only...

00:44.977 --> 00:47.544
two things that would trump
such a decision...

00:47.578 --> 00:49.046
an heir of Ventris...

00:49.080 --> 00:50.647
Or marriage to an
appointed noble.

00:50.681 --> 00:52.516
You are quite aware

00:52.550 --> 00:54.351
- that I'm already married?
- I am told

00:54.386 --> 00:56.686
that the Lady Trula's
consumption grows.

00:56.721 --> 00:58.288
You are indeed bold.

01:00.058 --> 01:02.026
This wasn't wolves.

01:02.060 --> 01:03.926
SOLDIER: <i>You have been placed</i>
<i>in custody of the court</i>

01:03.960 --> 01:05.461
to determine guilt.

01:05.495 --> 01:07.430
Guilt of what?

01:07.464 --> 01:08.631
(yells)

01:08.665 --> 01:09.932
No, please!

01:09.966 --> 01:11.300
Please, no! No!

01:13.137 --> 01:15.104
(grunting)

01:15.139 --> 01:17.340
(grunting in pain)

01:17.374 --> 01:18.474
(thudding)

01:18.509 --> 01:21.209
Ventrishire will be
divided into thirds,

01:21.244 --> 01:24.112
two territories going to
the neighboring shires...

01:24.147 --> 01:26.381
The coastal area
with a castle

01:26.416 --> 01:28.083
will fall to
my authority.

01:28.117 --> 01:31.053
Please, keep the gown
as our gift for your...

01:31.087 --> 01:33.155
loyalty and patience.

01:33.189 --> 01:35.823
I'm afraid the gown
will soon be of no use,

01:35.858 --> 01:37.925
nor will the decree
of division.

01:37.959 --> 01:39.860
I am with heir.

01:46.768 --> 01:48.769
This needs washing
in private,

01:48.803 --> 01:50.771
away from my
other vestures.

01:50.805 --> 01:52.206
Yes, Baroness.

01:54.408 --> 01:57.510
Is there anything else
in need of washing, my lady?

01:57.545 --> 01:59.312
No.

01:59.346 --> 02:02.048
The linens are
unstained.

02:03.084 --> 02:04.484
I know I've put

02:04.518 --> 02:07.520
a heavy burden on you,
dear Isabel.

02:10.124 --> 02:11.523
I'm afraid that

02:11.558 --> 02:13.392
nearly two weeks of thought

02:13.426 --> 02:18.063
has given me no better sense of
how to carry out my deception.

02:21.201 --> 02:24.269
Perhaps it's not a deception
at all, Love.

02:25.105 --> 02:28.239
You carry the proof
in your basket.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.508
Proof of but a single day?

02:30.542 --> 02:34.778
Every fertile field needs
a serving of more than one seed

02:34.813 --> 02:37.115
to bear a good harvest.

02:37.149 --> 02:41.252
Are you suggesting
that I open my...

02:41.286 --> 02:45.089
- fertile field to seed sowing?
- As you know, my lady,

02:45.123 --> 02:47.224
to offer advice
is above my status.

02:47.258 --> 02:48.492
Mm.

02:48.526 --> 02:51.294
A hardened rule
you would never break.

02:57.701 --> 03:00.937
Isabel...

03:00.971 --> 03:02.238
thank you.

03:04.441 --> 03:06.942
I am, and
will always be,

03:06.976 --> 03:09.111
in your service,
Lady Love.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074

03:20.289 --> 03:22.657
(sighs)

03:22.691 --> 03:25.160
Your morning meal,
Chamberlain.

03:31.467 --> 03:33.034
On the table.

03:42.076 --> 03:44.110
Taking to your
new duties?

03:44.145 --> 03:45.279
Yes, sir.

03:45.313 --> 03:47.281
Very well, thank you.

03:47.315 --> 03:49.516
And?

03:51.085 --> 03:54.019
And...

03:54.054 --> 03:55.488
I am learning much.

03:58.192 --> 04:00.493
And?

04:02.829 --> 04:04.763
And, um...

04:11.036 --> 04:14.038
You are in my debt.

04:14.073 --> 04:15.640
Yes, in debt.

04:20.379 --> 04:21.813
Thank you, Chamberlain.

04:25.218 --> 04:27.218
(indistinct conversations)

04:35.594 --> 04:37.661
Crush this mixture
into powder.

04:39.097 --> 04:42.065
Stir in the egg
of the red starling.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.500
You must lay
the paste thin

04:44.535 --> 04:47.103
over the scabs.

04:58.081 --> 05:00.049
And who is this gentle soul?

05:00.083 --> 05:01.550
LUCA:
Luca Maddox, good woman.

05:06.155 --> 05:07.656
Sweet calamus.

05:10.159 --> 05:11.326
Thank you.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.768
(indistinct, overlapping
conversations)

05:22.237 --> 05:23.704
Wait here.

05:28.610 --> 05:30.578
Is it not a risk,

05:30.612 --> 05:33.113
selling your remedies here?

05:33.148 --> 05:35.115
Your physicker
requested I come.

05:35.150 --> 05:38.885
He was weary of getting
lost in the Black Oaks.

05:38.919 --> 05:40.887
And I suppose
your hooded protector

05:40.921 --> 05:43.523
might scare away
good trade.

05:43.557 --> 05:45.124
Yes.

05:45.159 --> 05:46.326
He waits in the coves.

05:48.128 --> 05:50.397
And your brothers...

05:50.431 --> 05:52.198
how are they?

05:52.232 --> 05:54.065
As any man would be,

05:54.100 --> 05:57.836
trapped in a hole,
lock-kneed for 12 days.

05:57.870 --> 06:00.172
Your oils ease their pain.

06:00.206 --> 06:03.409
Helps them drift
to some comfort.

06:03.443 --> 06:04.410
And you?

06:04.444 --> 06:06.878
How is your pain?

06:08.147 --> 06:10.748
It seems no prayer
gives me relief

06:10.783 --> 06:13.384
from the horror
that plays out here.

06:13.419 --> 06:16.187
I wish I could give you
a remedy

06:16.221 --> 06:17.855
for your struggles, Wilkin,

06:17.889 --> 06:19.791
but you know
in your heart...

06:19.825 --> 06:22.193
I know nothing
in my heart anymore.

06:22.227 --> 06:25.095
JESSAMY:
What is that thing?

06:27.932 --> 06:30.900
This one...

06:30.935 --> 06:33.069
this one has
a crippled heart

06:33.103 --> 06:35.872
from so many
dreadful memories.

06:37.274 --> 06:39.576
Yea.

06:39.610 --> 06:41.745
She's not tried to hurt
the boy or herself

06:41.779 --> 06:43.346
but that one time.

06:45.148 --> 06:47.015
Use gentle caution,
Wilkin.

06:47.050 --> 06:50.486
Her angry ghosts push her

06:50.520 --> 06:52.655
close to madness.

(bell tolling in distance)

08:55.536 --> 08:57.236
Drink in haste, brothers.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.540
I'll deliver more
if I have time.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.209
I hear someone coming.

09:10.117 --> 09:13.151
(door creaks open)

09:16.623 --> 09:18.624
The hour brings
the change of guard.

09:21.093 --> 09:24.796
Allows us a few minutes
to speak openly.

09:31.703 --> 09:34.171
Go be young somewhere else, boy.

09:37.142 --> 09:38.475
Come.

09:44.583 --> 09:48.051
What matter begs sending away
the innocent?

09:48.085 --> 09:50.486
One that
concerns us all.

09:50.521 --> 09:53.690
I am in need of your skill
and confidence.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.663
We've learned that when you
speak of serving the many,

09:59.697 --> 10:02.065
it's only you that
reaps the bounty.

10:02.099 --> 10:03.732
CORBETT:
The fate of Ventrishire

10:03.767 --> 10:05.367
hangs by a French thread.

10:05.401 --> 10:08.737
Baron Pryce senses our weakness.

10:08.772 --> 10:10.873
He woos the king's favor

10:10.907 --> 10:12.975
in the hope that Edward
will grant him the land

10:13.009 --> 10:14.342
that was once his.

10:14.377 --> 10:15.678
TORAN:
And what skill of ours

10:15.712 --> 10:18.213
can halt this
noble boot-licking?

10:18.247 --> 10:20.382
His Majesty
has a passion

10:20.416 --> 10:22.750
for religious relics.

10:22.785 --> 10:25.587
Pryce possesses
an ancient Bible

10:25.621 --> 10:28.189
or scroll...
some rare holy thing

10:28.223 --> 10:30.091
salvaged from a cave
off the Nile.

10:30.125 --> 10:33.061
It travels
to Windsor today.

10:33.095 --> 10:34.963
The baron's gift
of devotion

10:34.997 --> 10:37.098
to our swayable king.

10:37.132 --> 10:39.466
And you want us
to seize the relic.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.301
Make it a gift to you.

10:41.335 --> 10:43.136
Not seize it.

10:43.170 --> 10:44.571
Destroy it.

10:44.606 --> 10:47.040
The risk of possession
is too great.

10:47.075 --> 10:48.875
Bring down the guards,

10:48.910 --> 10:50.143
set the wagon afire,

10:50.177 --> 10:54.081
burn the Bible and all the
other... boot-lickings inside.

10:54.115 --> 10:56.048
WILKIN:
Killing soldiers

10:56.083 --> 10:57.282
and destruction of noble goods

10:57.317 --> 10:59.351
is no lesser risk.

10:59.385 --> 11:02.521
The blame will fall
with the rebels and the thieves.

11:02.555 --> 11:04.690
Pryce will not have suspicion

11:04.725 --> 11:07.760
if there are but charred
remnants that leave no clues.

11:07.794 --> 11:09.128
TORAN:
And we're tradesman.

11:09.162 --> 11:12.063
We've no reason to risk death
and blasphemy.

11:12.098 --> 11:13.031
I would hope

11:13.065 --> 11:16.134
protecting Ventrishire
and the rule of our...

11:16.168 --> 11:20.238
baroness would be
reason enough.

11:20.272 --> 11:21.640
But...

11:21.674 --> 11:25.677
if you need greater cause...

11:27.713 --> 11:29.647
To comfort murderers

11:29.681 --> 11:33.651
with provisions
is a breach of law.

11:33.685 --> 11:37.154
You must have some concerns
for their welfare to risk

11:37.188 --> 11:40.157
serving your own time
in the coffin.

11:40.191 --> 11:42.026
They are not murderers.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.794
I decide what they are.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.029
You deliver the pain
of that decision.

11:46.063 --> 11:49.799
These men were found down trail
of the body

11:49.833 --> 11:52.168
and unwilling to give true name.

11:54.738 --> 11:58.574
That weighs the scale
with guilt.

11:58.608 --> 12:01.243
WILKIN:
But if we burn your Bible,

12:01.278 --> 12:03.845
you'll offer a different fate.

12:03.880 --> 12:06.514
They will be released
from their coffin traps

12:06.549 --> 12:10.018
and their sentences reduced
to servitude.

12:10.053 --> 12:12.253
- Slave of the court.
- They will work off

12:12.288 --> 12:14.289
their crime.

12:19.895 --> 12:21.862
(scoffs)

12:21.897 --> 12:24.865
Then let them wither

12:24.900 --> 12:27.001
in their holes
until we find another

12:27.035 --> 12:29.036
of greater guilt.

12:35.010 --> 12:38.011
We will do
your harsh deed.

12:46.587 --> 12:49.055
Leave within the hour.

12:49.090 --> 12:51.224
Wait for Pryce's caravan
off the pond trail

12:51.258 --> 12:52.992
to the south
of Heaven's Eye.

12:53.027 --> 12:54.226
And what of the prisoners?

12:54.260 --> 12:55.994
I will draft the
bondage letters

12:56.029 --> 12:58.097
to Lady Love,
and she will sign them.

12:58.131 --> 13:01.499
Complete your task and they
will see the morning sun.

13:16.048 --> 13:19.183
Your man grows more disturbed
with each new day.

13:19.218 --> 13:22.186
Be mindful that he does not
become a complication.

13:24.189 --> 13:26.991
You should be mindful
as well, Chamberlain.

13:27.025 --> 13:28.925
Since the baron's death,

13:28.960 --> 13:32.395
you've guzzled this new power
like sweet mead.

13:35.099 --> 13:38.902
Men never make sound choices
while drunk.

13:43.775 --> 13:45.074
(chuckles softly)

13:47.144 --> 13:50.112
(door creaks, closes)

13:52.182 --> 13:54.183
(townsfolk chattering
in distance)

14:05.027 --> 14:06.795
May I get you
anything else, my lady?

14:14.136 --> 14:17.605
Baroness, anything else?

14:17.639 --> 14:20.440
Yes, Isabel, I may need you
to fetch me a second meal.

14:20.474 --> 14:23.277
Perhaps a third.

14:23.311 --> 14:26.013
It appears that I need to
expand my girth with due haste.

14:35.356 --> 14:37.589
Shit.

14:59.245 --> 15:02.113
I hate the Welsh.

15:17.528 --> 15:19.129
Lord Gaveston.

15:19.164 --> 15:23.267
It is a profound honor
to welcome you to our castle.

15:23.301 --> 15:27.036
Milus Corbett,
Chamberlain of Ventrishire.

15:27.071 --> 15:29.072
Thank you, Chamberlain.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.009
Hm.
Is the baroness within?

15:33.043 --> 15:36.412
Yes, she makes her way
to greet you.

15:36.446 --> 15:38.714
May I ask why we have
the privilege

15:38.749 --> 15:40.416
of such an esteemed visitor?

15:40.450 --> 15:41.717
Ah...

15:41.752 --> 15:43.152
Baroness.

15:43.187 --> 15:45.020
You radiate with
even more beauty

15:45.054 --> 15:47.155
in your beloved Wales.

15:47.190 --> 15:49.191
(chuckles)
Sir Gaveston.

15:49.225 --> 15:51.226
A pleasure to see you again.

15:52.628 --> 15:55.931
I have missed your words
of sincere adoration.

15:59.202 --> 16:01.402
You travel
with such a humble retinue.

16:01.436 --> 16:03.237
Are you here for...

16:03.272 --> 16:04.738
sport and game?

16:04.773 --> 16:06.407
(chuckles)

16:06.441 --> 16:10.077
That is the secret
to my happiness, my lady.

16:10.112 --> 16:13.180
Everything I do
is sport and game.

16:14.416 --> 16:16.683
I was just about to tell
your handsome chamberlain...

16:16.718 --> 16:19.019
(chuckles)

16:19.053 --> 16:22.588
that I journey to perform
one of my most cherished duties.

16:24.091 --> 16:26.559
The declaration of heirs.

16:26.593 --> 16:29.695
Sir Gwynfor
is our Progeny Prophet

16:29.730 --> 16:31.431
and Uroscoper.

16:31.465 --> 16:33.099
Once he has, uh,

16:33.134 --> 16:35.367
acquired the proof

16:35.402 --> 16:37.937
that you carry the child
of Lord Ventris,

16:37.971 --> 16:39.738
the king will declare,

16:39.772 --> 16:41.106
if it be a male child,

16:41.141 --> 16:44.910
he will be given all the
rights to rule this shire.

16:44.945 --> 16:47.579
(chuckles)

16:47.613 --> 16:49.614
Thank you, Sir Gaveston.

16:50.984 --> 16:53.251
We will let you settle
and refresh.

16:53.285 --> 16:55.820
Isabel will show you
to our guest chamber.

16:55.854 --> 16:59.257
Ah, <i>charmant.</i>

16:59.291 --> 17:00.891
Baroness.

17:00.926 --> 17:02.893
Sir Corbett.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.112
I am sorry that
I did not share

17:22.146 --> 17:24.881
this news with you
sooner, dear Milus.

17:24.915 --> 17:27.715
But I only became certain
of my good fortune

17:27.750 --> 17:29.285
while on the trail to Windsor.

17:29.319 --> 17:30.786
And of course,

17:30.820 --> 17:32.621
as the earl has said,
I could not declare

17:32.655 --> 17:36.192
the joyous news
until His Majesty has his proof.

17:38.161 --> 17:41.364
The happiness I feel
for your news,

17:41.398 --> 17:45.333
heals any wounding
of my pride, Baroness.

17:45.368 --> 17:47.835
(chuckles)

17:49.405 --> 17:52.140
I understand the testing

17:52.174 --> 17:54.876
by this piss prophet

17:54.910 --> 17:58.079
can be quite a...

17:58.114 --> 18:00.280
disquieting thing.

18:00.315 --> 18:02.549
Allow me to be of
help in any way

18:02.583 --> 18:04.584
that best serves you.

18:06.187 --> 18:08.722
Thank you, Chamberlain.

18:18.232 --> 18:21.167
It seems that you have stirred
the imagination

18:21.201 --> 18:24.170
of our French visitor.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.072
Is that bad, Chamberlain?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.375
Not at all.

18:53.158 --> 18:54.659
Sir Gaveston.

18:54.693 --> 18:56.694
Baroness.

18:57.696 --> 19:00.064
Your devotion serves you.

19:01.066 --> 19:04.135
Our Savior blesses you
in so many ways.

19:04.169 --> 19:06.704
A keen mind,

19:06.739 --> 19:08.005
- beauty...
- (chuckles)

19:08.039 --> 19:09.405
...a stature

19:09.440 --> 19:12.509
that remains so lithe
and petite

19:12.543 --> 19:14.678
even while...

19:16.047 --> 19:20.017
When is it that you expect
this gift of an heir?

19:20.051 --> 19:21.985
Not until the colder months.

19:22.020 --> 19:24.554
It was the blessing of a union

19:24.588 --> 19:28.423
hours before Erik's death.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.695
As if God Himself
had filled your womb.

19:32.729 --> 19:35.297
Yes.

19:37.067 --> 19:39.535
Well, I will give you
time alone.

19:39.569 --> 19:43.471
I am sure you are in need
of your own devotion.

19:46.575 --> 19:50.178
I could understand
your disregard for English rule.

19:52.347 --> 19:55.249
But to boldly deceive
in the eyes of God.

19:55.284 --> 19:57.218
Well...

19:57.252 --> 19:59.653
it is more
than your noble status

19:59.688 --> 20:01.454
that is in peril, my lady.

20:01.489 --> 20:03.724
I have deep concern

20:03.758 --> 20:05.926
for your eternal salvation.

20:10.298 --> 20:12.099
Renounce this...

20:12.133 --> 20:14.802
charade presently,

20:14.836 --> 20:17.937
and you will suffer
no penalty of false words.

20:17.971 --> 20:20.439
It will be as if those lies

20:20.473 --> 20:23.242
never poured
from your tiny mouth.

20:33.853 --> 20:36.021
Well...

20:36.055 --> 20:38.890
Let us hope
God will take pity.

20:40.893 --> 20:44.830
For when you are found
to be a fraud,

20:44.864 --> 20:48.533
the king will have
your breasts cleaved off,

20:48.567 --> 20:52.002
your barren womb severed,

20:52.037 --> 20:56.207
and your head taken by sword.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.849
And the honorable

21:04.883 --> 21:07.817
and most exiled
Earl of Cornwall

21:07.852 --> 21:10.820
will be left with my pieces

21:10.855 --> 21:14.190
and my land.

21:15.159 --> 21:17.160
(quiet scoff)

21:18.695 --> 21:22.232
Sir Gwynfor will need today
to prepare his examination.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.869
Your first piss of morning
will land in his pot.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.313
(sighs)

21:40.093 --> 21:44.261
_

21:56.631 --> 22:00.200
WILKIN: This appears to be
the best vantage point.

22:00.234 --> 22:03.069
TORAN:
Yea.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.245
You seem to be
growing familiar...

22:12.280 --> 22:15.281
with the fair nobles
of Ventrishire.

22:15.315 --> 22:18.117
Our baroness.

22:18.151 --> 22:22.121
Lady Love tries to reason a man

22:22.155 --> 22:26.125
with pious devotion and
the skill to off a man's head.

22:26.159 --> 22:27.726
As do I.

22:27.760 --> 22:30.129
What about our
chamberlain?

22:30.163 --> 22:32.831
Are we to become
his puppets now,

22:32.865 --> 22:36.234
taking all dirty tasks
beneath his noble knights?

22:36.268 --> 22:38.803
Corbett's abuse of power
will have a hard end

22:38.838 --> 22:42.807
when the king decides
the fate of the shire.

22:42.842 --> 22:46.244
We are planted on tender
earth here, brother.

22:46.278 --> 22:48.813
The weight of secrets
will sink us,

22:48.847 --> 22:51.882
and everything we've loved
will be dead and buried.

22:56.754 --> 22:59.122
Yea, wit.

22:59.157 --> 23:01.158
We must be true.

23:14.104 --> 23:17.106
(women moan sensually)

23:25.114 --> 23:27.916
- What brings this...
- (women gasp)

23:27.950 --> 23:31.086
horrid display
of bacchanal to my chambers?

23:31.120 --> 23:33.088
We're deeply sorry, sir.

23:33.122 --> 23:36.124
It seems our good
chamberlain sent us here.

23:36.158 --> 23:37.959
Yea.

23:37.994 --> 23:39.527
With the task
of finding out

23:39.561 --> 23:41.561
what your need is
with this shire.

23:43.598 --> 23:46.066
He wishes that
you loosen my tongue?

23:46.101 --> 23:48.068
Yea.

23:48.103 --> 23:49.937
With ours.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.114
(everyone laughs)

24:01.148 --> 24:02.715
My girls.

24:24.370 --> 24:26.271
Clear the trail, stranger!

24:29.575 --> 24:31.976
Are you mad or just dull-witted?

24:32.010 --> 24:33.110
(others laugh)

24:36.949 --> 24:38.215
(horse whinnies)
Hyah! Hyah!

24:52.663 --> 24:54.597
(man screams)

25:24.126 --> 25:26.294
Dirty deed complete.

25:36.071 --> 25:38.473
(woman coughs, screams)

25:40.808 --> 25:43.243
WOMAN: Lord Christ!
O, Savior!

25:43.277 --> 25:45.778
- Please!
- (man screams, coughs)

25:45.813 --> 25:47.247
(woman shrieks)

25:50.485 --> 25:53.286
WOMAN (screams):
Oh, the pain!

26:03.296 --> 26:05.898
(Wilkin and Toran
grunting with effort)

26:11.071 --> 26:13.138
TORAN:
Wilk, no!

26:16.075 --> 26:18.109
He's long dead.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.128
"To my most pious
and beautiful, Trula.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.130
I hope these prayers bring you
as much peace and joy

26:40.165 --> 26:43.100
as your love brings me.

26:43.134 --> 26:45.702
Your devoted husband, Edwin."

26:47.171 --> 26:49.172
Lady Pryce.

26:51.975 --> 26:54.444
It was her physicker's wagon.

27:02.311 --> 27:05.514
Punisher!
You have returned.

27:32.212 --> 27:34.111
(grunting)

27:41.320 --> 27:43.388
<i>Mon liege!</i>

27:51.229 --> 27:54.198
(laughs)
Now we are true.

27:54.232 --> 27:56.800
This is who we are,
Wilkin Brattle.

27:56.834 --> 27:59.570
You knew she was
in that wagon.

27:59.604 --> 28:02.005
You don't make
those kind of mistakes.

28:02.039 --> 28:04.007
I did what
was required.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.109
As did you.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.077
We all share the burden
to protect the shire.

28:08.111 --> 28:09.412
MAN:
Over there!

28:10.780 --> 28:12.781
CORBETT:
Hold, hold!

28:17.287 --> 28:19.255
Maddox and I were engaged

28:19.289 --> 28:21.457
in a friendly demonstration
of defense.

28:24.493 --> 28:27.962
I was sharing some
grappling skills we plied

28:27.996 --> 28:29.997
on the Scottish battlefields.

28:41.676 --> 28:44.645
Go. Go.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.280
Yes, sir.

28:48.983 --> 28:53.019
(speaking French)

28:53.054 --> 28:54.388
CLARA:
Corbie.

28:54.422 --> 28:56.257
Good Chamberlain.

28:58.892 --> 29:00.260
Enough!

29:00.294 --> 29:01.427
You're hurt.

29:03.130 --> 29:05.164
It's no matter.

29:08.669 --> 29:12.071
We have news
to raise your spirit.

29:12.105 --> 29:13.573
Indeed.

29:13.607 --> 29:17.509
We took to this Gaveston
our most, um...

29:17.543 --> 29:19.511
Wetted slots.

29:19.545 --> 29:21.346
It was of no interest
to the Frenchman.

29:21.381 --> 29:24.349
You, however, most
handsome Chamberlain,

29:24.384 --> 29:26.951
were the only
temptation he uttered.

29:26.986 --> 29:29.354
Me?

29:29.389 --> 29:31.323
Ah.

29:31.357 --> 29:33.658
I suppose that would
have been an obvious turn.

29:33.692 --> 29:36.661
He inquired of
wives and lovers.

29:36.695 --> 29:38.696
Laid very heavy a point

29:38.730 --> 29:40.964
that he would be
in his chamber after supper.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.533
Alone.

29:42.567 --> 29:44.402
I see.

29:46.605 --> 29:48.606
Thank you, lovelies.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.202
My lady.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.204
Master Gawain.

30:22.238 --> 30:25.072
Seems we are both in need
of a peaceful setting.

30:37.319 --> 30:39.320
Seems you've had
a hard day as well.

30:44.525 --> 30:46.526
The slip of a tool

30:46.561 --> 30:48.595
while mending the grate
on the coffin traps.

30:50.665 --> 30:53.233
I hear the chamberlain
has decided

30:53.267 --> 30:56.603
to free the prisoners
within them,

30:56.637 --> 30:58.604
put the men
in servitude.

30:58.638 --> 31:00.773
Those prisoners are still
in that horrid hole?

31:00.807 --> 31:03.208
Yes, my lady.

31:03.243 --> 31:05.378
I will see that the letters
are drafted in haste,

31:05.412 --> 31:08.247
so I may release them.

31:09.449 --> 31:11.450
Thank you.

31:15.921 --> 31:17.889
A punisher who
concerns himself

31:17.923 --> 31:19.924
with the welfare of
those he punishes.

31:19.958 --> 31:22.960
It is no wonder I often find
you in troubled thought.

31:26.699 --> 31:28.700
Yea.

31:31.836 --> 31:34.204
There was a healer
at the market earlier.

31:34.238 --> 31:35.806
I should see if she has

31:35.840 --> 31:38.241
some balm I might put
on these scrapes.

31:40.344 --> 31:42.312
Baroness.

31:42.346 --> 31:44.314
Is it your healer?

31:44.348 --> 31:47.718
The one that renewed your vow.

31:49.686 --> 31:52.288
Yea, the same woman.

31:52.322 --> 31:54.123
This woman has
knowledge of nature

31:54.157 --> 31:56.158
and its course
with humors.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.797
Yes, it would be
one of her gifts.

32:00.831 --> 32:04.233
Are you in need
of... remedy, Baroness?

32:05.235 --> 32:09.638
I am in need of a...
different kind of wisdom.

32:09.672 --> 32:12.240
She is most different.

32:18.414 --> 32:21.416
Now you are the one lost
in troubled thought.

32:22.851 --> 32:24.384
Hmm.

32:24.419 --> 32:26.253
Yes.

32:27.556 --> 32:30.558
Do you ever feel like you're
living the life of another?

32:32.561 --> 32:35.930
That God intended you
to be someone else?

32:35.964 --> 32:38.699
Not greater or
of more prestige,

32:38.733 --> 32:41.734
but... truer.

32:46.273 --> 32:48.307
Forgive me.

32:49.510 --> 32:53.145
I'm afraid this day has
rubbed me raw of manners.

32:54.815 --> 32:58.584
It is a day
full of harsh rubbings.

33:06.025 --> 33:08.560
I will arrange a meet
with this healer.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.365
Thank you.

33:35.058 --> 33:39.058
The rank of field marshal
is a most prestigious ascension

33:39.059 --> 33:41.560
for a-a poor village boy from...

33:41.595 --> 33:43.162
uh, where did you--?

33:43.196 --> 33:45.063
- Ingthorpe.
- Ah... yes.

33:45.098 --> 33:48.767
And yes, a rise well-earned.

33:48.801 --> 33:50.902
But as is the way of the world,

33:50.937 --> 33:53.305
with veins that flow
with not a drop of royal blood,

33:53.340 --> 33:55.841
my head is at the rafters
of said ascension.

33:55.875 --> 33:57.842
Yes.

33:57.876 --> 34:00.645
We have much in common,
you and I, Milus.

34:00.679 --> 34:03.114
We take to the same sport.

34:03.149 --> 34:04.982
Indeed, Piers.

34:05.017 --> 34:08.686
I feel as if we have been
acquainted for many a year.

34:08.719 --> 34:11.289
Absolument.

34:11.322 --> 34:13.324

34:20.264 --> 34:22.799
Your, uh, baroness...

34:22.833 --> 34:24.801

speaking of her?

34:24.835 --> 34:26.670
Please.

34:26.704 --> 34:29.339
We have-- <i>oui-dire--</i>

34:29.373 --> 34:31.940
heard, uh, stories, yes?

34:33.009 --> 34:36.512
That she was struck
with a barren womb.

34:38.982 --> 34:42.051
Stories change their
truth as they travel.

34:42.085 --> 34:44.753
Do they?

34:44.788 --> 34:47.156
(chuckles)
A man as clever

34:47.190 --> 34:49.724
and resourceful as yourself,

34:49.757 --> 34:52.960
I am certain
you know all things

34:52.995 --> 34:55.897
above and below
these castle stones.

34:55.931 --> 34:57.699
You flatter
like a highly

34:57.733 --> 34:59.901
polished courtesan, dear Earl.

35:02.071 --> 35:05.139
Tell me.

35:05.174 --> 35:07.741
Why Ventrishire?

35:09.077 --> 35:11.178
I would think your influence
with His Majesty

35:11.213 --> 35:14.315
would earn you a far more
desirable appointment.

35:16.551 --> 35:19.119
And yet, you
take such effort

35:19.153 --> 35:23.022
to secure our humble
slice of moss.

35:23.056 --> 35:25.625
Forcing the decree of division.

35:25.659 --> 35:28.094
Traveling all this way to find

35:28.128 --> 35:30.430
the proof of Erik's heir.

35:30.464 --> 35:33.966
It makes one wonder if you are
looking for a place to hide.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.901
(chuckles)

35:35.936 --> 35:38.571
Ah, yes, well...

35:38.606 --> 35:41.873
like you, sweet Milus,

35:41.907 --> 35:45.344
I was forced to stir the hive
to get the honey.

35:45.378 --> 35:48.280
And now the bees,

35:48.314 --> 35:51.850
they come to sting.

35:51.884 --> 35:55.019
And what faces

35:55.054 --> 35:58.021
are on the other end
of those stingers?

35:58.056 --> 36:00.124
Scots?

36:00.158 --> 36:02.260
Marcher Barons?

36:03.295 --> 36:06.230
It's a weakness, I admit.

36:06.265 --> 36:09.867
But...

36:09.901 --> 36:13.370
my tongue...

36:13.404 --> 36:17.274
seems to loosen...

36:17.308 --> 36:19.342
when my cock

36:19.377 --> 36:21.344
rests...

36:21.379 --> 36:23.880
in a handsome mouth.

36:27.050 --> 36:30.186
It seems we share the gift
of forwardness as well.

36:38.060 --> 36:41.263
No.

36:41.298 --> 36:42.998
It will be much more pleasurable

36:43.032 --> 36:45.133
if you are on your knees.

37:01.983 --> 37:03.951
(chuckles)

37:03.985 --> 37:07.153
Did you honestly think
I would let dirt-born lips

37:07.188 --> 37:09.989
touch a rod that knows

37:10.024 --> 37:12.292

of beautiful things?

37:19.467 --> 37:21.934

37:21.968 --> 37:24.470
in need of a suckling.

37:49.127 --> 37:50.595

37:50.629 --> 37:53.030
Good evening.

37:53.065 --> 37:55.166
Do you require anything

37:55.200 --> 37:56.900

37:58.603 --> 38:01.839

38:30.389 --> 38:33.724

38:33.758 --> 38:35.726
This is foolish.

38:35.760 --> 38:39.396

38:39.430 --> 38:42.232

38:58.681 --> 39:01.783

39:01.817 --> 39:04.019
Talk to the healer.

39:04.054 --> 39:05.854
If she brings
no ease of your doubt,

39:05.888 --> 39:08.123
then we will leave.

39:10.792 --> 39:12.726
Yes.

39:29.444 --> 39:31.711

39:31.745 --> 39:34.514
An honor

39:36.451 --> 39:38.785
Thank you, Annora.
