[film roll clicks]

00:43.293 --> 00:46.337
[Sandi Tan]
When I was 18, a long time ago now,

00:47.088 --> 00:52.302
I had the idea that you found freedom
by building worlds inside your head.

01:00.101 --> 01:03.438
That you had to go backwards
in order to go forwards.

01:09.527 --> 01:13.823
That little kids
had the answers to everything.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.409
[insects chirping]

01:18.328 --> 01:21.039
[Sandi]
When I was 18, I had so many ideas,

01:21.623 --> 01:24.751
I hardly slept at all.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.817
In the summer of 1992,

01:48.900 --> 01:52.278
my friends and I shot a road movie
on the streets of Singapore...

01:53.029 --> 01:56.574
that was to become a kind of urban legend.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.328
That movie was called  Shirkers,

02:01.788 --> 02:04.290
a word which means "running away,

02:05.291 --> 02:07.043
avoiding responsibility,

02:08.461 --> 02:09.378
escape."

02:13.675 --> 02:16.636
I wrote the script and played the heroine,

02:16.719 --> 02:19.472
a 16-year-old killer named S.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.975
[owl hooting]

02:37.574 --> 02:39.993
[Sandi]  Nobody was making movies
like that in Singapore.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.078
So, we were pioneers.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.999
[dog barking, panting]

02:47.417 --> 02:50.378
The film was a time capsule of a Singapore

02:50.461 --> 02:53.673
that was both real and imaginary.

03:11.232 --> 03:15.653
Back then, the thing I wanted
more than anything was to make a movie.

03:16.738 --> 03:20.700
But I never imagined
it would end this way.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.577
[eerie song playing]

03:30.752 --> 03:32.170
[music stops]

03:42.263 --> 03:47.101
Twenty-five years later, I find myself
on a strange backward journey,

03:47.602 --> 03:50.188
replaying the past for clues.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.735
[man]  Okay, I listened to your tape
that you did in your room.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.446
I loved it. I like being your best friend.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.406
You're my best friend.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.703
I like knowing that you're around.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.497
I like knowing that we're connected,

04:08.581 --> 04:09.958
that we're partners in crime.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.294
Make me another tape, please.

04:13.962 --> 04:14.963
I miss you.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.556
[Sandi]  I learned to stop thinking
about that time...

04:27.517 --> 04:29.143
to pretend it never happened...

04:30.728 --> 04:33.022
which was, of course, impossible.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.987
Shirkers  became a secret history,

04:40.571 --> 04:42.115
shared by a small group of us.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.785
And it would haunt us

04:45.868 --> 04:47.287
and bond us

04:47.370 --> 04:48.579
and tear us apart.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.148
-[Sandi] Whenever you're ready.
-Now.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.527
[Sandi]  Jasmine and I were enemies
before we were friends.

05:19.610 --> 05:23.239
You thought I was an enemy, but I don't
know if I thought you were an enemy.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.158
Uh, yeah.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.286
We stayed enemies until we were 14.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.792
When we were growing up in the 1980s...

05:37.503 --> 05:41.424
the state and the family
were constantly in your face.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.343
[cheering]

05:43.426 --> 05:45.970
[typewriter keys clacking, ding]

05:46.054 --> 05:49.599
Singapore was so uptight,
its government even banned chewing gum.

05:50.391 --> 05:53.478
If Americans believe they are exceptional,

05:53.561 --> 05:54.812
let me tell you,

05:54.896 --> 05:57.732
Singaporeans know we are exceptional.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.361
A sweaty little island in 1965,

06:01.444 --> 06:05.281
Singapore became one of the richest
countries in the world by the year 2000.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.492
[fireworks whistle, pop]

06:09.535 --> 06:11.788
When Jasmine and I were 14,

06:11.871 --> 06:16.000
we discovered unusual movies
and unpopular music.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.086
[playing off-key]

06:20.630 --> 06:24.175
[Sandi]
And as weirdos, we became best friends.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.261
We came from very different backgrounds...

06:28.096 --> 06:29.639
but we were thick as thieves.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.061
My family was intense.

06:40.608 --> 06:44.070
My parents' marriage was collapsing
even before I was born,

06:44.821 --> 06:47.949
and so I was raised by my grandparents.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.913
When it rained, our front lawn
looked like chocolate milk.

06:56.541 --> 07:00.628
In 1981, my grandfather insisted
on having these pictures taken...

07:01.963 --> 07:05.133
because his beloved house
was about to be torn down.

07:09.137 --> 07:13.516
In 1985, the house was replaced
by this condo.

07:17.311 --> 07:21.399
It still flooded,
but it was no longer chocolate milk.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.319
I was always expected to shine.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.363
Which was exhausting.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.074
I needed a way out.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.786
So, of course, I liked Jasmine's family.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.539
They were warm and undemanding

07:36.622 --> 07:40.126
and didn't care if we built
crazy shrines in Jasmine's room.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.504
We had the God of Theater...

07:44.547 --> 07:46.799
and the Goddess of Scriptwriting.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.050
[typewriter clacking]

07:48.509 --> 07:50.470
[plane whooshing by sound]

07:53.598 --> 07:56.434
We showed up at school
dressed up as nurses.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.602
[school bell ringing]

07:57.685 --> 08:01.314
And I challenged the authorities
at the Film Society.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.942
[man]  Dear Sandi: We will certainly try
to acquire the films you've requested.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.612
[Sandi]
I desperately wanted to make movies.

08:09.197 --> 08:13.826
I gave imaginary interviews
as imaginary filmmakers.

08:14.619 --> 08:18.331
Hi, I would like to share
with you my movie

08:18.414 --> 08:23.419
Magic Fire Brain,
which, uh, is completely original.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.796
There were lots of crowd scenes.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.468
I read  American Film
and  Film Comment  religiously.

08:31.719 --> 08:36.097
But it was impossible to see these movies
unless I got very creative.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.645
I established
a clandestine videotaping syndicate

08:41.729 --> 08:43.481
with my cousin Vicki in Florida...

08:44.649 --> 08:47.151
just so I could watch  Blue Velvet.

08:52.990 --> 08:56.744
Jasmine and I devoured
what people around us ignored.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.334
We started writing for  BigO,

09:03.417 --> 09:07.255
Singapore's underground rock zine,
when we were 14.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.885
BigO  was run by Philip Cheah,
in all his poker-faced glory,

09:12.969 --> 09:16.681
and he would make us tapes
of Patti Smith and The Velvet Underground

09:16.764 --> 09:20.601
and quiz us on them
before he would let us join their club.

09:21.269 --> 09:25.898
In Singapore, you had very strict
censorship across music and film.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.360
A lot of the great classic albums
were still banned.

09:29.443 --> 09:33.823
We saw the revolution that took place
in the UK and in the US,

09:33.906 --> 09:36.576
and we wondered whether
that could actually happen here.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.580
[Sandi]
We created elaborate collages for  BigO,

09:41.581 --> 09:43.040
which they all hated.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.794
I think we were way too punk for them.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.756
They were a lame boy's club anyway.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.635
So it was always us...

09:55.386 --> 09:56.929
against the world.

09:58.514 --> 10:03.060
Our greatest achievement was publishing
our own zine,  The Exploding Cat...

10:03.978 --> 10:06.564
on the photocopier
at the National Library.

10:08.232 --> 10:13.112
Exploding Cat  was our attempt
to catalog everything that angered us,

10:13.195 --> 10:14.363
that made us laugh.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.419
The Cat became its own thing.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.840
We received letters
from New York, London...

10:33.883 --> 10:36.010
Paris, Jerusalem,

10:36.719 --> 10:39.263
even prisons in three different states.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.516
Above all...

10:44.352 --> 10:46.395
it was a catalog of us.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.481
Me,

10:49.231 --> 10:50.775
my friends,

10:53.069 --> 10:55.446
our tiny island in the center
of the world,

10:56.155 --> 10:57.573
charting our own destiny...

10:58.824 --> 11:01.118
in 1989.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.748
[girl]  The next story is chapter 39.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.125
[Sandi]  Hang on, just one more thing.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.629
Back in those days, I was obsessed
with  The Catcher in the Rye...

11:12.213 --> 11:15.091
and Salinger's idea of saving children.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.387
So I trained my baby cousins
to never grow up.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.264
[boy speaking gibberish]

11:22.348 --> 11:23.933
...people talk.  [laughs]

11:24.016 --> 11:26.018
-[Sandi] Wen...
-Yes.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.478
Say something.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.438
[girl] I'm going to color.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.525
[girl humming]

11:37.530 --> 11:40.783
[Sandi]  Or if they had to grow up,
to grow up different.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.121
[girl laughing]

11:48.999 --> 11:51.585
[Sandi]
"Hysterical" was superior to "ordinary."

11:53.254 --> 11:54.505
[girl]  I hate you.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.299
[Sandi]  Even "depressed"
was superior to "ordinary."

11:57.383 --> 12:00.302
[boy hums fanfare] You no good mangy mutt!

12:00.386 --> 12:01.554
You're stupid.

12:09.437 --> 12:13.733
A long time ago, in early '91,
we took the filmmaking class,

12:13.858 --> 12:17.194
probably the first filmmaking class
available here.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.532
In this classroom
and the adjoining classroom as well.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.952
So there was a whole bunch of us, you, me,

12:25.035 --> 12:28.289
a whole strange assortment of persons.

12:29.206 --> 12:35.463
[Sandi]  Our teacher was Georges Cardona,
a man of unplaceable age and origin.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.049
[Georges Cardona]  I think we ought
to make a film about the guy

12:39.133 --> 12:41.552
who measures the visibility in Singapore.

12:41.635 --> 12:42.762
[woman laughs]

12:42.845 --> 12:46.599
He projected himself
to be an American filmmaker,

12:47.641 --> 12:52.563
and was there to teach us,
impressionable 18, 19 year-olds,

12:52.646 --> 12:54.231
about film production in Singapore.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.567
[Sandi]  We met Sophie at the class.

12:57.109 --> 13:00.488
She was so nice and stable
and trustworthy.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.782
I wasn't sure
she would make a good friend.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.076
Georges brought the three of us,

13:06.160 --> 13:09.955
Sophie, Jasmine and me
into his inner circle.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.082
Cecilia runs a video bordello.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.419
My impression of Georges, uh,

13:15.503 --> 13:19.048
first and foremost,
was his eyes, very metallic.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.342
It was almost ice, icy blue.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.846
He spoke in a very slow,
calm, measured tones.

13:26.972 --> 13:30.226
And I just remember, even at that point,

13:30.309 --> 13:32.394
this kind of dissonance, you know,

13:32.478 --> 13:34.522
the eyes seemed so cold

13:34.605 --> 13:36.565
but his demeanor seemed so warm.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.319
And he had this ability

13:40.402 --> 13:42.488
that when he spoke to you,

13:42.571 --> 13:46.659
you felt that you were his sole focus.

13:48.035 --> 13:51.121
[Sandi]  Georges was like no other adult
I knew in Singapore.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.627
He liked to just sit
and watch the light change.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.008
He took us to shoot
colorful Hindu festivals

14:03.092 --> 14:06.345
that my family
would have found frightening.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.806
[Hindu fast-paced music playing]

14:17.189 --> 14:20.526
[Sandi]  He talked about movies
the way I wanted to talk about movies.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.948
He loved the French New Wave.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.033
[man speaking French]

14:28.742 --> 14:30.911
And soon, so did I.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.546
When the film class ended
at nine or ten at night...

14:41.839 --> 14:44.008
we would drive around
the island with Georges.

14:46.844 --> 14:51.515
We kept him out late, even though
we knew he had a wife and a baby

14:51.599 --> 14:52.975
waiting for him at home.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.769
-[Georges] And I barked.
-[girl laughs]

14:55.853 --> 14:57.855
[crickets chirping]

14:59.023 --> 15:00.649
[Georges] Can you hear the crickets?

15:02.359 --> 15:03.861
[Sandi]  We went looking for ideas.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.197
We went looking for wild dogs.

15:07.531 --> 15:08.449
[Sandi] Bang!

15:08.532 --> 15:10.659
[Georges laughs] Were you rolling?

15:10.743 --> 15:11.702
[Sandi] Yeah.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.706
[Jasmine] Sandi,
I didn't know you were into this.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.502
Oh, stop it! I'm not in the mood tonight.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.212
[Sandi] Nice soundtrack.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.631
[laughing]

15:23.714 --> 15:24.632
Hurry up.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.051
[Georges] We're speaking loudly.

15:28.761 --> 15:33.474
And all the lovers are sort of aggravated
with us and they have cleared the area.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.194
[Sandi]  He was my first friend
who was a grown man.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.367
He picked us.

15:52.326 --> 15:55.412
But he let us feel like we picked him.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.093
Those night drives bled into my dreams.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.262
Of course I wanted to make a road movie.

16:15.516 --> 16:20.521
Instead, I went away
to a strange, cold place.

16:21.146 --> 16:21.981
England.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.788
I thought I would find my tribe.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.374
But I had left them.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.794
Jasmine went to New York...

16:44.920 --> 16:46.046
Sophie went to LA...

16:47.548 --> 16:50.259
And Georges stayed in Singapore.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.512
I felt so stranded.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.681
I poured all of myself...

16:56.390 --> 16:58.017
into letters to Georges...

16:58.392 --> 16:59.852
[pen scratching]

16:59.935 --> 17:00.978
and Jasmine.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.618
Georges didn't write letters or emails.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.497
On very rare occasions,

17:20.830 --> 17:23.500
he sent me tape recordings of his voice.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.588
[Georges]  What are you doing now?

17:28.672 --> 17:29.548
Um...

17:30.299 --> 17:32.217
Thinking of going to the US in Easter.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.221
And renting a car,
then traveling through the US...

17:38.807 --> 17:41.685
for all the way from New Orleans
to Arkansas.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.687
[Sandi]
He invited Jasmine and me to join him.

17:44.688 --> 17:49.276
There were few things that excited me more
than the idea of an American road trip.

17:49.735 --> 17:53.947
I thought, "Fuck the French New Wave,
we're going to live our own movie."

17:54.031 --> 17:57.034
[man speaking French]
Sandi Tan, the only child

17:57.117 --> 18:00.370
of a toothbrush salesman
and a worker in a mortuary.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.581
Sandi was parentless from age two.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.708
Jasmine Ng, the eldest daughter

18:04.792 --> 18:08.545
of a mafia kingpin
in Singapore's Chinatown,

18:08.629 --> 18:11.965
and a feeble-minded housewife.

18:12.049 --> 18:16.512
Georges Cardona is 89 years old and mute.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.388
No other info available.

18:20.390 --> 18:21.934
[Sandi]  Jasmine didn't see it that way.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.978
In the end, only I went.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.278
I flew to Los Angeles to meet Georges.

18:34.279 --> 18:38.951
He and I drove to San Francisco,
taking the slowest, most scenic roads.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.665
Even back then I knew how it looked.

18:45.374 --> 18:49.086
I was on the road with a married man
more than twice my age.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.798
So I didn't tell anyone.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.136
He gave me signals,

18:58.637 --> 19:01.640
strange signals, late night conversations

19:01.723 --> 19:04.518
where he told me
people thought we were lovers.

19:06.019 --> 19:09.773
And then one night,
he invited me to touch his belly.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.237
I just ignored him.

19:21.785 --> 19:24.079
It disturbed me to even think about it.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.791
And we both pretended it never happened.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.050
Then we drove to New Orleans
where he grew up.

19:47.102 --> 19:52.900
Georges was showing me the South,
with its moss and bugs and ghost stories.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.947
This was the place where he had
transformed himself into an artist.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.750
He told me how when he was 12,

20:09.833 --> 20:13.795
he watched his older brother bleed
to death on their mother's lap.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.343
He told me how when Jayne Mansfield
was killed in a car accident...

20:20.302 --> 20:24.181
her decapitated head rolled over
to where he was in his car.

20:27.184 --> 20:31.813
He told me he was the inspiration
for James Spader's character

20:31.897 --> 20:34.191
in  Sex, Lies, and Videotape.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.653
[woman]
Something to take my mind off this trip.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.655
So I was just...

20:40.530 --> 20:41.448
I just...

20:42.783 --> 20:44.368
I just did it on the plane.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.704
[Sandi]
Whether his stories were actually true

20:47.788 --> 20:49.831
seemed beside the point.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.501
I loved his storytelling,

20:53.293 --> 20:56.838
and how his stories made time
and place and truth

20:56.922 --> 20:58.423
absolutely porous.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.592
[Georges]
...the dominant member of the party...

21:00.676 --> 21:03.220
[Sandi]  I was suddenly staring
at a puddle of blood

21:03.303 --> 21:05.055
in a living room in the '60s.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.892
I was two degrees away
from Jayne Mansfield's head,

21:10.018 --> 21:12.312
three degrees from Steven Soderbergh.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.902
That road trip was significant
for another reason.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.073
I chose Georges as my new best friend.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.582
We talked about making a movie together...

21:33.625 --> 21:34.668
a road movie.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.885
I went back to school and immediately
threw everything into a script.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.887
[keyboard clacking]

21:47.431 --> 21:49.391
[faxing noise]

21:54.104 --> 21:58.317
"S tells her best friend TB
she can save the world when it ends.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.862
Her tools are games, toys,
and her imagination.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.990
She saves the world
in small numbers, starting with..."

22:05.073 --> 22:08.577
In my vision of the world,
there are movers,

22:08.660 --> 22:09.995
there are shakers,

22:10.078 --> 22:11.496
and there are shirkers.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.667
Georges sent me a fax.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.259
It started out with...

22:26.553 --> 22:29.806
the mysteriously-named lead character S.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.600
I wonder what that stands for.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.729
[Sandi]  My idea was to do a road movie
in a country

22:35.812 --> 22:38.023
you can drive across in 40 minutes.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.860
We follow this cryptic character,
she goes around Singapore.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.696
She might have been the Grim Reaper,

22:44.780 --> 22:49.034
just picking off these characters
and taking them on this afterlife journey.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.953
Because Sandi had an obsession
with Bergman.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.750
[Sandi] I don't have-- I hated Bergman.

22:56.833 --> 23:00.587
But anyway, go on. Can we start
and you describe the plot?

23:01.296 --> 23:05.634
You as the screenwriter,
this was not a three-act structure.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.469
[Sandi] How could we...?

23:07.552 --> 23:10.430
It's only something that 19-year-olds
could've just said,

23:10.514 --> 23:11.932
"Let's go do it. Why not?"

23:12.808 --> 23:14.935
[Sandi]  I finished the script in June,

23:15.018 --> 23:17.145
and we had to start shooting in July

23:17.229 --> 23:20.941
before the school term began
for Jasmine and Sophie.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.945
It was less than two and a half months.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.071
[Sandi] Pre-production.

23:27.197 --> 23:31.284
No, pre-production and shoot for a feature

23:31.368 --> 23:34.079
while most of us
were still working day jobs.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.541
Like I said, you were the only one
who was not working.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.631
I remember, um,

23:45.006 --> 23:48.635
that you were
the sort of "chief ideologue" of the trio.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.178
Sophie was the gopher.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.263
Jasmine...

23:52.639 --> 23:54.349
was the technical person,

23:54.433 --> 23:58.061
I think, who was, you know,
always fussing with this and that.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.066
[Sandi]  We eventually broke
into two camps,

24:03.900 --> 24:07.446
Jasmine and Sophie, who thought we should
wait a year and do it next summer...

24:09.364 --> 24:12.492
versus me and Georges
who just wanted to get the film made.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.370
[man singing]

24:15.495 --> 24:19.791
[Sandi]  One of Georges' favorite films
was Werner Herzog's  Fitzcarraldo...

24:21.042 --> 24:23.170
in which the mad Klaus Kinski

24:23.253 --> 24:26.256
commands an army of Amazonian natives

24:26.339 --> 24:29.092
to pull a ship over a mountain for him.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.890
This is one of Georges'
guiding inspirations.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.311
And it became mine too.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.899
[Jasmine]  You've always been a very
determined and quite ambitious person.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.570
You just wanted it done at any cost,

24:49.362 --> 24:51.448
and you were willing to just burn things

24:51.531 --> 24:53.658
just so that you could make your own film.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.078
[Sandi]  Well, okay,

24:57.162 --> 24:59.623
but after years
of plotting to make a film,

24:59.706 --> 25:02.375
I couldn't just
let this opportunity slip by.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.380
It wasn't as if Jasmine was an expert.

25:10.383 --> 25:14.095
She designed this audition flyer
in her unique style.

25:17.974 --> 25:21.186
Of course nobody could read it
so nobody showed up.

25:22.604 --> 25:26.525
She was furious when we got someone
more conventional to try again.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.694
She thought we were selling out.

25:31.571 --> 25:32.781
[Jasmine] Don't worry about it.

25:32.864 --> 25:36.201
It's just gonna be like informal
improvisational kind of exercise.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.662
My left side, my right side.

25:38.745 --> 25:39.663
[Jasmine] Yeah, right.

25:40.163 --> 25:41.957
Hold up your number.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.876
[Sandi]  The auditions were run
by Sophie and Jasmine.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.380
[Sophie] Basically, the main character
of the film is 16 years old.

25:48.463 --> 25:52.175
Hey. Wow. Let me have a closer look.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.515
[Jasmine] Okay, can you just imagine
you're in the car right now...

25:59.057 --> 26:02.477
and you're going around, you're knocking
all these old women down and-- You know?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.396
[ululates]

26:05.814 --> 26:06.648
[Jasmine] Okay.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.525
-Yeah.
-[Jasmine] That's all right.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.947
[Sandi]
Georges was nowhere to be seen or heard.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.117
Except here.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.127
And so I was the screenwriter,

26:27.210 --> 26:28.962
Sophie was the producer,

26:29.045 --> 26:31.089
Jasmine would be the editor...

26:33.216 --> 26:35.552
and Georges was the director.

26:39.889 --> 26:42.601
Sophie, as our 19-year-old producer,

26:42.684 --> 26:47.188
wrote letters in the voice
of an experienced executive producer.

26:50.859 --> 26:55.030
I secured a meeting
with a high-profile person,

26:55.113 --> 26:59.159
and it took me a lot of time and courage,

26:59.242 --> 27:02.287
and before the person arrived,
Georges said to me,

27:03.204 --> 27:05.165
"Okay, now you go into the kitchen.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.167
I'm gonna take the meeting."

27:07.792 --> 27:10.170
That was a very difficult moment for me.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.755
I didn't believe in Georges.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.966
I did not believe in Georges,
but I believed in the film.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.178
Do I yell at Georges

27:18.261 --> 27:20.972
or is it better for me
to remain in the kitchen

27:21.056 --> 27:24.059
and have him secure the deal
so the film could move forward?

27:24.726 --> 27:26.603
And I chose the film.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.648
[Sandi]  We were trying
to mount a feature film

27:29.731 --> 27:32.150
on the scantest of practical knowledge.

27:33.693 --> 27:36.946
We had a production assistant
who was 14 years old.

27:38.657 --> 27:42.577
Georges talked Ronnie,
a 30-year-old first time DP

27:42.661 --> 27:44.913
into shooting the film for us.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.791
I got involved as a sound man,

27:47.916 --> 27:51.586
and I volunteered to do the storyboarding.

27:52.962 --> 27:55.090
I have no clue what  Shirkers  is about.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.510
-Can I say that? Would that offend you?
-[Sandi] No, no, no.

27:59.636 --> 28:03.973
My grandmother played my grandmother
and my baby cousin played my baby cousin.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.978
Her furry little arms
had their own little story.

28:12.232 --> 28:17.987
Oh, I thought, "Oh, great, they're looking
for a nurse, and I'm one."

28:18.613 --> 28:22.534
I've always wanted to see
what acting is all about, you know?

28:22.617 --> 28:23.702
[school bell rings]

28:23.785 --> 28:26.329
[Sandi]  I talked Philip
into playing the crossing guard...

28:27.122 --> 28:29.999
because that's essentially
what he was to me.

28:31.376 --> 28:36.089
When I first heard about the  Shirkers
project, I thought, it's about time.

28:36.172 --> 28:40.510
The only sort of independent feature films
that were shot in Singapore

28:40.593 --> 28:44.097
were like the legendary
They Call Her Cleopatra Wong.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.852
[grunting]

29:00.739 --> 29:04.576
[Sophie]  There was very little
domestic filmmaking activity, right?

29:06.161 --> 29:11.750
And then we were going to be
the next film after  Medium Rare.

29:11.833 --> 29:16.212
[Sandi] Medium Rare  was a film
about a Singaporean serial killer

29:16.296 --> 29:18.715
who was played by an American TV actor.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.719
And come on, we can do better than that.

29:24.137 --> 29:28.057
We dispatched an army of location scouts
across the island.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.400
I made sure
they found the mannequin shops...

29:38.276 --> 29:40.737
and the old-timey bakery that I loved

29:40.820 --> 29:43.114
because I knew
they wouldn't be around for long.

29:45.241 --> 29:49.496
Jasmine and Sophie negotiated with Kodak
and the film equipment houses...

29:51.247 --> 29:54.626
and we got all our film
and camera equipment for free.

29:57.462 --> 30:02.842
There remained one last role to be cast:
the heroine S.

30:03.551 --> 30:06.471
I even felt like I couldn't play the role,
'cause it was a non-role.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.556
You wanted to play the role.

30:10.725 --> 30:14.354
Whether it was a good decision
to have cast you in the role,

30:16.147 --> 30:18.817
I think the footage will speak for itself.

30:19.776 --> 30:20.610
[Sandi] Yeah.

30:21.778 --> 30:25.114
"Exterior: S's Street, afternoon.

30:26.950 --> 30:31.663
A lazy suburban neighborhood
with rows of one-story houses,

30:31.746 --> 30:36.292
lawnmower sounds,
cutlery clangs, whining puppies,

30:36.376 --> 30:40.839
and faint sounds of radio fuzzying
with '30s Shanghai showtunes,

30:41.548 --> 30:46.427
track along the fronts of the houses
until camera frame bumps into S.

30:48.429 --> 30:51.808
Our 16-year-old protagonist
enters the scene

30:51.891 --> 30:55.061
with an old suitcase and an old camera."

30:56.312 --> 30:57.772
She is coming home.

31:01.442 --> 31:02.861
S lives with her grandmother...

31:04.070 --> 31:06.155
and her cousin, baby Woo Woo.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.742
They live next door to her best friend TB.

31:11.327 --> 31:15.331
TB lives with her mother,
who loves to smoke and watch TV.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.501
And her little brother TJ,

31:18.585 --> 31:21.462
who rides around the neighborhood
looking for trouble.

31:27.135 --> 31:32.140
One beautiful day, S gets TB
to go with her to shoot her piano teacher.

31:32.515 --> 31:35.268
[metronome ticking]

31:35.351 --> 31:37.228
[gunshot, thump]

31:38.146 --> 31:40.315
[metronome continues ticking]

31:43.067 --> 31:45.945
When TB gets too busy
to hang out with her,

31:46.029 --> 31:48.072
S goes looking for a new sidekick...

31:48.948 --> 31:51.784
and four more people
she likes enough to kill.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.289
Sleeping on her favorite spot
in the grass,

31:56.581 --> 32:01.794
she meets a visibility inspector
named Rahman and goes home with him.

32:03.463 --> 32:05.548
She abducts his little son, Haryo.

32:06.925 --> 32:11.054
She and Haryo walk around the island
looking for more people to collect.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.555
[insects chirping]

32:13.222 --> 32:14.057
[dog panting]

32:14.140 --> 32:17.226
[Sandi]  They spot Cecilia, the nurse,
and her giant dog, Cherish,

32:17.310 --> 32:18.686
and follow them home.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.023
They meet Cecilia's daughter, Monster,

32:22.106 --> 32:24.567
who is epileptic, but who loves to dance.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.653
[dog panting]

32:28.321 --> 32:30.239
S is a  Catcher in the Rye...

32:30.990 --> 32:32.992
and so they are three.

32:33.701 --> 32:36.079
-Together, they meet Montana Bob.
-[girl gasps]

32:36.746 --> 32:39.332
He's a funny dude,
so they follow him home.

32:40.625 --> 32:44.587
Meanwhile, there's the mystery boy
S keeps encountering.

32:45.213 --> 32:49.258
She develops feelings for him,
which means she has to kill him.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.346
That's two down, three to go.

32:55.390 --> 32:59.060
She meets Albert, the self-made man
who built a fortune in sticky tape,

33:00.561 --> 33:02.897
and he's eager to show off
his massive new house.

33:04.732 --> 33:06.484
S meets his wife Mimi...

33:08.695 --> 33:09.904
their son Robert...

33:10.363 --> 33:13.533
and their maids, Portrero and Pacifica.

33:14.742 --> 33:17.954
Robert tells S he's an armchair hedonist.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.206
They go driving.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.667
His friends are all dweebs.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.211
Time is running out.

33:25.837 --> 33:29.090
And S has three more people
to take to the other world with her.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.845
It's not clear if this world is heaven,

33:33.928 --> 33:36.180
hell or a supermarket.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.307
So things happen.

33:41.936 --> 33:43.312
Or maybe they don't.

33:44.772 --> 33:49.027
Because maybe this whole thing
was a dream after all.

33:56.159 --> 33:59.370
Well, because, like,
the plot was almost immaterial.

33:59.454 --> 34:03.249
-You know, it was a mood piece. It was...
-Yeah.

34:04.751 --> 34:05.752
I don't know.

34:10.882 --> 34:14.761
[Sandi]  My script called
for the largest dog in the country,

34:14.844 --> 34:18.389
and Sophie got hold of this
giant wolfhound named Mega.

34:20.391 --> 34:24.020
Then Sophie and Jasmine sneaked him
into the supermarket...

34:24.728 --> 34:26.397
when the manager's back was turned.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.195
[Sophie]  I faked a seizure...

34:33.196 --> 34:34.906
in order to draw crowds.

34:34.989 --> 34:38.326
So I was the crowd wrangler as well.

34:41.661 --> 34:45.291
[Sandi]  Sophie and Jasmine stole
these seniors out of an old folks home.

34:49.462 --> 34:52.465
And returned them
before they even knew what happened.

34:54.132 --> 34:57.303
And we made all the grown up women smoke.

34:58.471 --> 34:59.472
And smoke.

35:00.681 --> 35:01.891
And smoke.

35:05.520 --> 35:10.066
We captured some startling performances
from friends and strangers.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.028
You were really great
as the Detergent Lady.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.615
I was not really great.
I think you love laughing at your friends.

35:17.698 --> 35:20.159
[Sandi]
There was Freda as my best friend TB.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.789
Kaylene as my disabled sidekick, Monster.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.793
And Pohshon as Monster's mom.

35:31.170 --> 35:36.217
You were supposed to take my child away
from me and I was like...

35:36.843 --> 35:40.888
crying because you're gonna
take her away from me for good

35:40.972 --> 35:44.392
and, see, you're making me cry now.
[laughs]

35:51.023 --> 35:53.901
Our passion and our earnestness...

35:55.111 --> 35:56.237
came through.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.948
At that time, I thought that  Shirkers...

35:59.824 --> 36:01.576
as it was proposed,

36:02.702 --> 36:05.788
was incredible,
it was way ahead of its time.

36:08.207 --> 36:11.419
This was a period when America
was making some of these movies

36:11.502 --> 36:13.129
with Winona Ryder, I believe.

36:13.212 --> 36:17.133
And I think that to have
a Singapore side of things

36:17.216 --> 36:21.429
and especially when it's fronted by Sandi,

36:21.512 --> 36:23.264
absolutely astounds me.

36:26.434 --> 36:29.687
[Sandi] Did you ever read the script?
Like, did you feel it was childish?

36:29.770 --> 36:32.440
Yeah, but that was the beauty of it,
right? You know that.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.028
You know that.
It was so personal, wasn't it?

36:44.410 --> 36:47.205
[Sandi]  Georges came up
with an idea for a set piece.

36:59.342 --> 37:03.930
And it was only much later
that I realized the idea wasn't even his.

37:17.985 --> 37:20.863
My friend Leon was so full of himself,

37:20.947 --> 37:23.074
claiming that every girl
was in love with him.

37:23.658 --> 37:27.161
And so I gave him the kind of fate
I thought he deserved.

37:29.288 --> 37:30.831
[brakes screeching, thump]

37:33.251 --> 37:37.755
In my world of  Shirkers,
there were different categories of boys:

37:39.715 --> 37:41.676
the boys I thought delectable,

37:43.469 --> 37:45.972
the boys I liked as good friends,

37:47.473 --> 37:49.141
and as in life,

37:50.184 --> 37:52.603
I made friends with strange men

37:52.687 --> 37:54.939
because I was bold in that way.

37:57.400 --> 38:01.445
One of the most visceral memories
I have of  Shirkers

38:01.529 --> 38:04.323
was the scene in the bowling alley.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.165
We spent a whole day shooting.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.961
It involved a lot of emotional energy.

38:17.044 --> 38:18.713
Remember, you know, you're 18, 19.

38:19.505 --> 38:22.466
In the end, I remember asking Georges,

38:23.384 --> 38:25.886
"How was it?
You know, how were the takes?"

38:27.054 --> 38:31.475
And he looked at me and he's like,
"The camera jammed on the first take."

38:32.226 --> 38:36.063
So... we'd shot nothing.

38:36.981 --> 38:40.151
And this was, I don't even know
how many hours in that day,

38:40.943 --> 38:42.069
and I lost it with him.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.949
[Sandi]  We had to go back
to the bowling alley the next day

38:47.033 --> 38:50.369
and do it all over again.

38:51.620 --> 38:54.457
-You're going too fast, man. Pull out!
-I can't! I can't!

38:54.540 --> 38:56.876
Why are you chasing him?
You know you're off the case.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.544
The boss is gonna have your ass!

38:59.045 --> 39:01.922
[Sandi]  While we were shooting,
our friend Ben was busy

39:02.006 --> 39:04.050
working on the soundtrack for  Shirkers.

39:05.217 --> 39:09.138
I knew you from  Exploding Cat
and  BigO  magazine.

39:09.722 --> 39:14.643
At the time, I guess my resources meant
that I would have just had one tape.

39:15.019 --> 39:17.188
A lot of little doodles...

39:18.230 --> 39:19.231
on guitar...

39:20.441 --> 39:23.402
electric, a lot
of backwards stuff, I think.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.990
The first time,
I remember my skin crawling.

39:28.074 --> 39:31.619
It was like I was ushered away
from you guys at Newton Circus.

39:32.912 --> 39:37.416
What I wasn't expecting
is Georges to take me aside,

39:37.500 --> 39:40.461
escort me to his car,

39:41.420 --> 39:44.965
like some gangster meeting
or a policeman meeting an informer

39:45.049 --> 39:47.968
or something like that,
straight out of the movies.

39:48.594 --> 39:51.847
I thought, "Okay, he's going to listen
to the cassette of the stuff I have,"

39:52.640 --> 39:56.143
which I thought was odd because it was
for you guys, but I didn't get that.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.603
He was just threatening me,

39:57.686 --> 40:02.066
sussing me out to see if I had an agenda
and, you know, telling me off that...

40:03.025 --> 40:05.403
"Don't take advantage of these guys"
or something like that.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.822
I was like, "What? Sorry?"

40:08.406 --> 40:12.576
He also tells me
that a far more professional

40:12.660 --> 40:17.706
and established musician
was working on the soundtrack,

40:17.790 --> 40:19.250
which was news to me.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.210
[Sandi] But you left the tape with him.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.964
-Yeah. I thought they were going to you.
-[Sandi] Why?

40:26.882 --> 40:30.302
[Sandi]  I didn't know it then,
but Georges took Ben's only tape...

40:31.178 --> 40:34.348
and banned him
from visiting us on the set.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.436
I don't remember exactly
the chain of events,

40:38.519 --> 40:40.646
but things just got worse and worse.

40:42.481 --> 40:46.444
[Sandi]  Jasmine started keeping notes
about what was actually going on.

40:48.487 --> 40:50.656
Just read it. You wrote this.

40:51.532 --> 40:53.534
"Everything is bloody uncertain.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.037
Mr. C. has no idea what he's doing,

40:57.121 --> 40:58.956
he has no idea
how he's gonna get the money.

40:59.373 --> 41:02.376
He claims he has a production manager
who worked on  Apocalypse Now."

41:03.210 --> 41:04.253
Who was that?

41:04.336 --> 41:05.629
I don't know.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.506
You were there. You were at the meeting--

41:07.590 --> 41:09.216
Obviously that person didn't show up.

41:11.260 --> 41:15.181
How can we continue with this
when I was pointing all these things out?

41:15.264 --> 41:16.348
So it was true.

41:16.932 --> 41:19.935
It was just really you and Georges
who wanted this to happen.

41:21.061 --> 41:24.982
You weren't paying attention
to any of these progress reports.

41:25.065 --> 41:28.277
I was paying attention, but I just thought
we're just gonna wing it.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.613
Like I do.

41:30.696 --> 41:33.157
Because we were doing the work--
doing the legwork,

41:33.240 --> 41:34.992
and you thought you were
just gonna wing it.

41:39.330 --> 41:43.292
You were obviously being an asshole.
You've always been an asshole.

41:43.375 --> 41:46.462
Just as much as you have
the capacity to be really wonderful,

41:46.545 --> 41:48.923
you have as much capacity
of being an asshole.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.930
[Sandi]  So maybe I was an asshole,

41:56.013 --> 41:58.891
but I just wanted us to keep going,
no matter what.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.185
There was no time to think.

42:02.853 --> 42:06.440
Georges was shooting us
from a bridge overlooking the track.

42:23.582 --> 42:24.583
[Georges] Train.

42:31.090 --> 42:33.926
[Sandi]  I heard the train
even before I heard his warning.

42:34.009 --> 42:35.094
[Georges laughing]

42:40.975 --> 42:43.269
Do you think it was fun for him
to dick us around like that?

42:43.352 --> 42:44.603
Of course. What do you think?

42:55.489 --> 42:58.784
With two weeks left to go,
we ran out of money.

43:00.744 --> 43:04.290
Georges said he needed just $10,000...

43:04.873 --> 43:07.167
or the production
would have to be shut down.

43:09.378 --> 43:13.716
Sophie and I felt we'd come too far
to let this happen.

43:15.718 --> 43:19.597
So Georges drove us from ATM to ATM.

43:22.474 --> 43:24.059
And over the next few nights...

43:25.019 --> 43:29.148
Sophie and I withdrew all of our savings.

43:31.900 --> 43:33.611
We never told a soul.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.742
After shooting wrapped,

43:39.825 --> 43:43.370
Sophie, Jasmine and I
were completely spent.

43:44.913 --> 43:47.291
But we had pulled off the impossible,

43:47.374 --> 43:48.626
we made a movie!

43:50.628 --> 43:53.047
[upbeat music playing]

44:05.851 --> 44:07.895
Sophie went back to LA.

44:07.978 --> 44:09.813
Jasmine went back to New York.

44:10.814 --> 44:12.399
I went back to England.

44:14.109 --> 44:18.864
Leaving Georges in Singapore
to process the 70 cans of film

44:18.947 --> 44:21.075
and to tell us
what the footage looked like.

44:22.034 --> 44:25.579
None of us had seen
a single frame of what we had shot.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.085
And so...

44:32.336 --> 44:33.337
I waited.

44:37.549 --> 44:38.550
And I waited.

44:42.388 --> 44:43.806
And I waited.

44:51.313 --> 44:52.606
Christmas went by.

44:54.733 --> 44:56.151
New Years went by.

44:57.903 --> 45:00.447
Finally, a package arrived...

45:01.407 --> 45:02.950
from Georges Cardona.

45:09.707 --> 45:10.874
[Georges]  I hope you're fine.

45:14.378 --> 45:16.547
I hope you managed
to open your bottle of wine.

45:17.172 --> 45:18.882
Don't drink it all at one time.

45:20.134 --> 45:24.179
Listen to classical music. Piano, Chopin,

45:24.930 --> 45:25.931
Beethoven.

45:26.974 --> 45:28.142
It's very soothing.

45:29.518 --> 45:31.645
Okay, that's it for now.

45:33.105 --> 45:34.606
I'll be sending you some stuff.

45:36.650 --> 45:37.818
[click]

45:38.902 --> 45:41.822
[Sandi]  And so I waited some more.

45:45.284 --> 45:46.952
Summer was approaching again.

45:47.953 --> 45:51.206
And that was when Jasmine thought
she might have to go back to Singapore,

45:51.707 --> 45:52.958
to edit the film.

45:54.501 --> 45:55.711
Just read it--

45:55.794 --> 45:58.172
"He thinks that both Sophie
and I are overreacting...

45:58.964 --> 46:01.383
and falling into unnecessary fits
of paranoia."

46:04.386 --> 46:06.388
[phone ringing]

46:07.014 --> 46:09.850
Because of where I was working at,
it would have been possible for me

46:09.933 --> 46:13.270
to edit the film,
finish the film, do everything.

46:16.482 --> 46:17.441
[phone is put down]

46:18.108 --> 46:20.986
[Sandi]  I finally received another tape.

46:22.780 --> 46:23.655
[Georges]  Hi.

46:24.823 --> 46:27.075
First of all, the telephone rang...

46:27.743 --> 46:30.788
and it was, well, it's New York calling.

46:31.663 --> 46:34.625
Your very best friend called today.

46:36.001 --> 46:39.379
At three o'clock in the morning
she was watching TV and she was...

46:39.755 --> 46:40.839
"Can you hear me?

46:41.465 --> 46:44.092
We were wondering how the film is doing?"

46:46.303 --> 46:47.888
So I said, "Who is we?"

46:47.971 --> 46:51.475
She said, "Oh, come on,
we, the people in this part of the world."

46:52.768 --> 46:57.105
So she's truly American, she speaks like,
"We, the people of the United States."

46:58.023 --> 46:59.900
Um, anyway...

47:00.984 --> 47:03.070
So I decided I better make this recording

47:03.153 --> 47:08.242
before any more
strange calls come through.

47:10.744 --> 47:11.620
[click]

47:12.412 --> 47:15.207
[Sandi]
That was the last we heard from him.

47:19.545 --> 47:20.671
He was gone.

47:21.463 --> 47:22.840
And so was  Shirkers.

47:30.138 --> 47:32.724
It really hit me like a ten-ton truck.

47:32.808 --> 47:35.102
That really exhausted--

47:35.185 --> 47:39.606
I think I just, like all that energy
just zapped out of me in that one instant.

47:39.690 --> 47:43.777
There was a piece of my spirit that died.

47:50.534 --> 47:51.785
[Sandi]  All I was left with...

47:52.536 --> 47:54.538
were these fuzzy memories...

47:56.415 --> 47:58.125
of being on the set...

48:00.752 --> 48:01.879
and just waiting.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.053
[Georges] Is Sandi in the picture?

48:11.972 --> 48:13.056
Camera ready.

48:19.897 --> 48:23.025
[Sandi]  Georges took everything.

48:24.985 --> 48:27.070
From deep in the fuzz,

48:27.154 --> 48:29.907
I remembered one final incident.

48:31.074 --> 48:33.118
On the last day of the shoot,

48:33.201 --> 48:35.871
only Georges, Ronnie and I were left.

48:37.456 --> 48:40.334
We drove out to a patch of land
by the airport...

48:42.336 --> 48:45.547
and built a very strange contraption.

49:00.312 --> 49:03.398
It was to make
our young actor Romaino fly.

49:05.233 --> 49:07.903
But there was no such flying scene
in my script.

49:14.368 --> 49:18.121
"How are we gonna get rid of the harness
and the rope?" I asked Georges.

49:20.248 --> 49:23.835
"Don't worry," he said,
"There's computers."

49:26.505 --> 49:30.968
After the long hours spent trying to film
that completely made up scene,

49:33.261 --> 49:35.430
he popped open the camera by mistake.

49:36.890 --> 49:38.475
Or maybe it wasn't by mistake.

49:39.601 --> 49:41.561
And there was no film in it.

49:48.443 --> 49:49.444
Twenty-five years later...

49:50.737 --> 49:55.909
I'm now wondering if he was sending me
a secret message only I would understand.

50:01.456 --> 50:05.085
There's a scene in my script
where Haryo discovers

50:05.168 --> 50:07.337
there's no film in S's camera.

50:08.213 --> 50:11.466
She tells him, "It doesn't matter,
because when you look through the hole

50:11.550 --> 50:14.720
and go 'click' it catches something

50:14.803 --> 50:17.305
or at least your mind catches something."

50:17.973 --> 50:21.852
You don't need film. Just the action
of doing that helps you remember.

50:24.688 --> 50:26.648
What was he trying to tell me?

50:27.691 --> 50:29.234
"Film or no film,

50:30.152 --> 50:32.154
you must remember this."

50:41.079 --> 50:43.665
[Sophie]
Was he role-playing as a director?

50:44.666 --> 50:49.004
Did he just view
this entire filmmaking venture

50:49.087 --> 50:51.798
as this psychological exercise?

50:52.549 --> 50:55.343
[Sandi]  We were no longer magical kids
who made a movie.

50:56.928 --> 50:59.181
We were just kids.

51:02.100 --> 51:06.396
Shirkers  is such a free film
because you were very free yourself.

51:07.439 --> 51:10.650
It was such a joy
that you were willing to experiment

51:10.734 --> 51:12.736
and express anything on your mind.

51:14.863 --> 51:16.448
[Sandi]  But when I lost  Shirkers,

51:17.324 --> 51:18.784
I lost that too.

51:22.996 --> 51:27.417
Don't get me in it.
I refuse to be part of this thing.

51:28.585 --> 51:32.339
I became a terrible
22-year-old film critic

51:32.422 --> 51:34.508
at the largest newspaper in Singapore.

51:44.309 --> 51:47.479
And I made them
let me interview my heroes.

51:53.360 --> 51:57.489
A publisher approached me to write
a fictionalized memoir of  Shirkers...

51:58.240 --> 52:00.283
but I said I wasn't ready.

52:01.660 --> 52:04.996
In the years that followed,
I said no to interviewers

52:05.080 --> 52:07.082
asking me to talk about  Shirkers.

52:07.749 --> 52:11.795
It was something I just wanted to forget.

52:19.302 --> 52:21.972
Exactly five years
after  Shirkers  wrapped...

52:22.722 --> 52:26.184
a mysterious package arrived
at Jasmine's office.

52:28.436 --> 52:30.605
They were videotapes from Georges Cardona,

52:31.356 --> 52:35.193
which had to mean they contained  Shirkers.

52:37.237 --> 52:40.699
I remember, maybe incorrectly,

52:40.782 --> 52:43.368
that it was a very kind
of joyous occasion.

52:43.451 --> 52:45.328
[Sandi]
Sophie, me and you were going to come--

52:45.412 --> 52:47.497
It was at my workplace, yeah.

52:47.581 --> 52:49.624
[Sandi]
And we were gonna watch these tapes.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.002
Then they all turned out to be...

52:52.586 --> 52:53.461
[click]

52:53.545 --> 52:55.213
[static noise]

52:58.633 --> 53:00.302
Was it all just snow?

53:01.011 --> 53:03.597
Like there was really nothing.

53:04.931 --> 53:07.225
And I thought, "How cruel."

53:07.309 --> 53:11.813
I mean, what stakes did he still have
in this mind game?

53:16.401 --> 53:18.737
Give us the material
so we can finish the film.

53:27.412 --> 53:30.165
[Jasmine]  We couldn't believe
how ridiculous the situation was.

53:30.707 --> 53:32.375
So surreal, so unimaginable.

53:32.459 --> 53:33.835
[pen scratching furiously]

53:33.919 --> 53:35.879
[Sandi]  I was beyond furious with Georges,

53:36.713 --> 53:38.965
but there was nowhere
for me to direct my rage.

53:39.674 --> 53:41.593
So I wrote it all down.

53:44.638 --> 53:46.806
"I envisage some measure of a showdown...

53:48.767 --> 53:50.185
[tires screech]

53:50.644 --> 53:52.771
...with pyrotechnics and slick editing."

53:59.527 --> 54:01.196
As far as I'm concerned,

54:01.279 --> 54:04.908
he should disappear deep and far
into the Amazon jungle, where he belongs,

54:05.909 --> 54:09.496
amongst his distinct relation,
the buck-toothed boa.

54:10.914 --> 54:11.915
Lowlife."

54:11.998 --> 54:14.292
[grunting]

54:22.050 --> 54:24.386
[Sandi]  We forced ourselves to move on.

54:42.445 --> 54:43.655
My baby cousin Yao...

54:44.614 --> 54:46.199
gave me this book of mosquitoes.

54:50.745 --> 54:53.707
But my baby cousins were no longer babies.

55:00.714 --> 55:02.299
You can't see anything.

55:04.384 --> 55:08.471
I made my peace that a chunk of my life
would forever be lost.

55:12.517 --> 55:14.102
And I moved to New York...

55:14.853 --> 55:18.565
to attend film school
at Columbia University.

55:21.026 --> 55:22.986
I know I was doing things backwards.

55:24.154 --> 55:25.196
First I made a movie,

55:26.323 --> 55:27.741
then I became a film critic,

55:28.575 --> 55:30.410
then I went to film school.

55:33.038 --> 55:36.416
But that's what happens
when you no longer have a map.

55:42.380 --> 55:44.883
I spent ten years in the wilderness.

55:46.009 --> 55:47.218
I tried to write that book...

55:47.927 --> 55:49.387
about the making of  Shirkers.

55:50.513 --> 55:51.848
But I just couldn't do it.

55:53.933 --> 55:57.896
Instead, I wrote screenplays
for films that would never be made.

56:00.148 --> 56:03.401
Shirkers  was now a distant memory.

56:09.657 --> 56:12.369
Then it began sending me distress signals.

56:15.622 --> 56:18.792
I heard these pings when I saw  Rushmore.

56:34.349 --> 56:35.767
And I heard them again...

56:36.810 --> 56:38.061
during  Ghost World.

56:49.656 --> 56:51.699
Then silence once more.

56:52.617 --> 56:54.327
[crickets chirping]

56:54.411 --> 56:56.996
But I knew now that it was alive.

56:58.456 --> 57:00.959
And I knew we had to meet again.

57:02.544 --> 57:05.797
Suddenly, I found myself in my mid-30s,

57:06.923 --> 57:09.217
in Los Angeles, of all places.

57:12.595 --> 57:14.389
I decided to turn to fiction.

57:16.015 --> 57:19.144
Because to write a novel,
I didn't have to wait for anyone.

57:20.437 --> 57:21.396
It's just me...

57:22.313 --> 57:23.398
and my ghosts.

57:30.280 --> 57:33.575
My novel,  The Black Isle,  was the story

57:33.658 --> 57:36.619
of a young woman with extraordinary powers

57:36.703 --> 57:40.498
who falls under the influence
of a charismatic, but sinister man.

57:43.168 --> 57:45.628
Writing it felt like an exorcism.

57:47.172 --> 57:48.840
But I would be wrong about that.

57:51.759 --> 57:53.887
On September 11, 2011,

57:55.013 --> 57:57.891
I received an email from a familiar name.

58:00.810 --> 58:02.437
It was Georges's wife.

58:05.148 --> 58:08.276
She said Georges was dead.

58:24.334 --> 58:28.004
She also told me she had found
70 cans of film

58:28.087 --> 58:32.467
labeled  Shirkers,  and that
they were all in perfect condition.

58:35.553 --> 58:40.683
I felt as if a curse, which lasted
20 years, had finally been lifted.

58:45.104 --> 58:49.484
His widow sent me box after box
of things I hadn't seen in years.

58:51.486 --> 58:53.363
Georges had kept everything.

59:00.912 --> 59:04.666
I pulled out some of the slides
that were taken in his studio.

59:09.379 --> 59:10.630
And there was Kaylene,

59:11.381 --> 59:13.007
the girl who played Monster,

59:13.883 --> 59:15.385
surrounded by my stuff.

59:19.722 --> 59:22.767
[camera shutter clicking]

59:23.601 --> 59:26.479
Now why would Georges keep everything...

59:27.272 --> 59:28.648
from  Shirkers?

59:35.321 --> 59:37.865
He even wrote this letter
on behalf of the crew.

59:41.035 --> 59:45.081
"At the moment,
the film is in the editing suite.

59:45.164 --> 59:46.499
But we are almost there.

59:47.292 --> 59:50.003
Shirkers  will be completed by October,

59:50.086 --> 59:52.839
hopefully in time for Cannes Festival.

59:54.132 --> 59:55.216
Have a nice day."

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:08.896
Georges and his stories were so exotic
that he was very hard to place.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:10.440
Um...

01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:16.195
I remember first he started
describing movies from start to finish.

01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:21.909
And then he started telling stories
about his own life.

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:26.623
His family wanted to demolish a dam,

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:28.458
I guess, on their property

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:30.460
and make the river flow again.

01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:34.130
So Georges built a three-stage rocket.

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.549
And his hand got exploded.

01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:42.221
He told me about his brother in Colombia

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:46.976
running into the house
with a knife in his femoral artery

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.771
and bleeding to death
on the kitchen floor.

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:52.899
He got arrested, uh...

01:00:53.566 --> 01:00:56.319
by the police,
who thought he was a Cuban burglar.

01:00:56.402 --> 01:00:59.405
From jail, he called an uncle
in New Orleans

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:03.493
and that uncle said, "Come to New Orleans.
I'll take care of you."

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:08.373
And at one point my foot felt wet,

01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:12.919
and I realized he was in tears
at his own stories

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:15.338
and his tears were dropping on my foot.

01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:19.175
[Sandi]  These were all stories
Georges told Grace

01:01:19.258 --> 01:01:21.386
on the very first day they met

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:25.973
in the swimming pool
of the Raffles Hotel in 1985.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:30.186
And then I thought, "Good God,
he doesn't even know my name."

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:35.733
[man speaking French]  No longer a child,

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:38.111
Sandi Tan has turned into a detective

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:43.241
who must travel across two continents
to solve this 25-year mystery.

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:48.621
[Sandi]
Long ago, I went on the road with Georges.

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.166
Now I was on the road again without him,

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:54.293
but not really.

01:01:57.046 --> 01:02:01.259
It was so like Georges that he would want
me to chase him down this way.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.595
-[woman] Hey. How are you?
-Hi.

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:08.224
-Oh, it's been a long time.
-It's been a long time.

01:02:08.307 --> 01:02:09.809
[woman]  But you haven't changed.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:20.153
Oh, Sandi, I have been dreading today.
I'm glad to see you.

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.904
-[Sandi] Yeah.
-And I want to help you out.

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:26.159
Whatever happened, I have no clue.
I have no clue.

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:30.455
[Sandi]  The widow remains so horrified

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:34.667
by her 25 years with Georges
that she didn't want to be named.

01:02:39.338 --> 01:02:40.673
I don't even know how he died.

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:44.010
[woman]
He had a girlfriend who was, like, 21.

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:48.264
Um, not only was she young,
but she was from Belgium...

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.933
and a chemist.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.935
And he went to go to bed.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:55.563
His arteries closed up
and he passed out...

01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:57.982
and died.

01:02:58.524 --> 01:02:59.358
[laughs]

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.611
-He died like that, yeah.
-'Cause the funny thing--

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:03.404
-[woman]  He was too young, wasn't he?
-Yeah.

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:05.865
[woman]  He was actually four years older
than what we thought.

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:08.618
[Sandi]  When did you find out
he was four years older?

01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:09.911
[woman]  When we got divorced.

01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:14.290
He always told me that his passport
had the wrong date

01:03:14.373 --> 01:03:16.083
and the wrong day.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:19.086
[Sandi]
So even his birthday wasn't his birthday.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.797
[woman]  It was two days before.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.509
But by making it two days later,
he got to be a different horoscope.

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:25.426
[laughs]

01:03:25.843 --> 01:03:27.386
He was really a Cancer.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:32.892
[Sandi]  The poetry of that
was just pure Georges Cardona.

01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:37.939
[woman]
Whatever Georges told me, I believed.

01:03:38.022 --> 01:03:42.109
I am a completely trusting person,
you know, gullible, whatever.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.529
That's why this is all so hard for me.

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:49.116
Every time he got involved with filmmaking
it was a horrible experience for me.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.453
-You know, this is expensive.
- [Sandi]  You paid for everything, right?

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:55.581
-I mean--
-[woman]  No, not everything.   But a lot.

01:03:56.415 --> 01:04:00.378
Wherever he was, as long as we were
together, which was until 1998,

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.590
he carried that film with him and he
always made sure it was air-conditioned

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.968
and it was like, "Oh, my God."

01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:09.595
It was like a cross around my neck.

01:04:11.055 --> 01:04:14.684
I think though, in Singapore,
he kept it at the studio that he had.

01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:25.236
[Sandi]  She and Georges left Singapore
for Perth, Australia,

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:29.740
where he had her sink her savings
into buying him a vineyard.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:34.203
Which he said he would learn to run
by reading books on the subject.

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:40.459
[woman]
We had a little room, and it was in there.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:44.589
That's when I wanted to get rid of it,
because it was taking up a whole room.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:50.636
[Sandi]  When they got divorced two years
after that, he moved to Seattle...

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.681
and then to Houston, where he died...

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.059
always carrying with him

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:58.769
the 70 cans of film

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:02.648
and boxes and boxes of scripts
and storyboards.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.901
[woman]  I thought, who does that?

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:17.663
My wife reminded me this morning,
my wife met Georges in 1985.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:23.377
And her thought was, "I think he must
be in the Witness Protection Program."

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:25.379
[laughing]

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:33.346
I think former students and protégés
of Georges, like you and me,

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:37.767
remain obsessed with him, first of all,
because we're storytellers,

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.435
and he's a great story.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.980
I met Georges Cardona sometime
in the late '70s.

01:05:43.397 --> 01:05:46.025
I learned through the local media

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:49.570
that Georges had opened the legendary
Lighthouse Media Center.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:51.906
So I would have been 21.

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.659
And we instantly bonded,

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:57.036
instantly there was chemistry there.

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:59.580
I thought, "My God,
I've died and gone to heaven,"

01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:03.209
because here he had these cameras and
tape recorders that I'd only read about.

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:07.463
I mean, nobody south
of the Mason-Dixon Line, probably,

01:06:07.546 --> 01:06:09.465
had professional Super 8 equipment.

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.051
And Georges had that kind of charisma.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:16.180
I mean, he had this uncanny way
of making adventure happen in your life,

01:06:16.263 --> 01:06:18.599
or at least the anticipation of adventure.

01:06:25.606 --> 01:06:26.899
[Sandi]  I asked the widow...

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.569
for a Georges Cardona tour of New Orleans.

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:40.162
Oh, this is where Georges lived,
he lived on the left,

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.039
in that little garage apartment.

01:06:42.748 --> 01:06:43.749
You see it?

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:50.756
When we first got married,
we both worked for the same company.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.801
I did renderings of mausoleums.

01:06:53.884 --> 01:06:58.514
I was a horrible renderer
of mausoleums. [laughter]

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:05.396
And the place where we had our shop,
it was called the University Section.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.857
[Sandi] What was the name of the shop?

01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:12.069
[woman] Lighthouse Media Center.

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:14.030
And, um...

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.283
now I'm looking for Maple Street.

01:07:17.658 --> 01:07:20.828
I think it was where this gray house is.

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:26.000
Maybe it was where this yellow house is.
It just looks totally different now.

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:29.712
It was somewhere around here, I can't
believe I can't remember where it was.

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:33.466
How could it have disappeared?
Right here--

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:36.052
[Sandi]  We spent hours
looking for the film center

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:38.095
that Georges had set up with her money.

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:40.848
[woman] We lost $36,000, but...

01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:46.979
I must have been totally...
Maybe I was brainwashed. Who knows?

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.198
[woman]  Georges wrote to me.

01:07:57.281 --> 01:08:00.951
We were staying in Cambridge, England
at that point and said,

01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:04.163
"I'm going to send somebody to you.
She's a genius.

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:06.082
She's mostly self-taught.

01:08:06.665 --> 01:08:07.583
She needs you."

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:11.796
[Sandi]  He thought she might encourage me
to write a screenplay,

01:08:12.713 --> 01:08:16.884
just as he had once talked her
into writing a screenplay for him.

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:21.013
Just before I met him I had started
writing my first novel,

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:25.684
and he asked me if I would collaborate

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.895
on a movie project with him.

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:31.982
He wanted to make a noir set
in New Orleans,

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:33.859
and he was calling it  Night Decoy.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:40.407
What he proposed
was for me to come to New Orleans...

01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:45.955
and he would talk to me.
I would record it,

01:08:46.037 --> 01:08:49.250
and then I would go home
and make a film script out of it.

01:08:50.876 --> 01:08:54.880
There was a man and two women, uh,

01:08:55.589 --> 01:08:58.050
a tough, hard-boiled woman named Audrey...

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:02.763
and a sweet Asian named Chelly.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:07.100
And this man obsesses about Audrey

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:08.935
and is...

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:13.649
videotaping her
without her knowing in her apartment.

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:20.363
There was a constant feeling
of  Peeping Tom -ism to Georges.

01:09:22.448 --> 01:09:25.202
He never came on to me, personally.

01:09:25.786 --> 01:09:28.663
I think Georges was good with women
in another way.

01:09:29.206 --> 01:09:33.169
I think he could get from them
what he wanted,

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:36.046
and what he wanted wasn't always sex.

01:09:37.214 --> 01:09:41.343
He got me to work on his dreams

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:44.305
for probably four or five years

01:09:44.388 --> 01:09:46.390
instead of writing my own stuff.

01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:48.350
It's always been a mystery.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:49.768
Good Lord. How...

01:09:50.227 --> 01:09:53.479
Uh, how did I become an intern?

01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:58.235
He had this really uncanny way
of helping you

01:09:58.319 --> 01:10:00.613
feel like you could achieve
your dream project,

01:10:01.238 --> 01:10:04.074
but then when you got closer
to achieving your dream project,

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:05.868
he felt the need to sabotage it.

01:10:06.785 --> 01:10:09.705
So I wrote this slasher film
called  The Last Slumber Party.

01:10:10.122 --> 01:10:12.791
And it was meant to be
kind of the culmination,

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:16.462
the graduate school
of the Lighthouse Media Center group.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:19.506
Georges was the director
of photography, but also...

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:21.383
the guru.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.429
So years later,
I had some discretionary income

01:10:25.512 --> 01:10:27.514
that I could put back into my filmmaking.

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:31.227
So I ordered all the film negative
from Motion Picture Labs in Memphis,

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.145
which is where Georges had sent the film,

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.940
and Georges had an ongoing relationship
for years with these people.

01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:38.817
Except that some of the negative
was missing.

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:43.489
I have a feeling that Georges
did something with it.

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:47.034
I can't prove it, but it certainly
would not be inconsistent

01:10:47.117 --> 01:10:49.036
with other things that he had done.

01:10:49.703 --> 01:10:52.289
[Sandi]  I know it's terrible
to feel a twinge of joy

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:54.041
at someone else's misfortune,

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:57.336
but hearing this made me feel less alone.

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:03.801
The widow and I continue to search
for remnants of her life with Georges.

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:07.179
It's a nightmare driving.

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:09.223
Been this way already and I can't find it.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.892
You all might not realize how happy

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:14.937
this makes me
that I can't even remember where it was.

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:21.652
[Sandi]  I hoped that by driving around
with her I'd get closer to him.

01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:25.197
But all she had were dead ends.

01:11:28.575 --> 01:11:32.579
He had this perverse need
to create a mythology.

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:36.834
To speculate as to why
Georges would go around

01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:39.628
claiming that he was the inspiration

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:43.549
for the protagonist in Steven Soderbergh's
Sex, Lies, and Videotape...

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:46.302
I worked on the crew
of  Sex, Lies, and Videotape,

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:49.513
with my dear,
beloved best friend Larry Blake,

01:11:49.596 --> 01:11:52.558
also part of the original
Georges Cardona mafia.

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:55.144
and Georges felt jealous,

01:11:55.227 --> 01:11:58.188
threatened, left out, entitled,

01:11:59.064 --> 01:12:01.692
that two of his protégés

01:12:01.775 --> 01:12:03.902
had this association with this film

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:05.654
that had become a cause célèbre.

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.615
We all worked on this film
that won the Palme d'Or.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:13.203
And it's entirely in keeping with
Georges's personality and character,

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:16.957
as I understand it,
that he would concoct such a story.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.849
[birds chirping]

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.852
[Sandi] When we were trying
to get hold of him over the years,

01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:38.729
like, there would be no trace.

01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:42.149
The only thing that's on there
is this missing persons...

01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:44.651
[woman]
That was, to me, the most bizarre thing,

01:12:44.735 --> 01:12:47.321
to see him smoking,
'cause I never saw him smoke.

01:12:47.404 --> 01:12:49.031
And he never smelled like smoke.

01:12:49.114 --> 01:12:51.867
-[Sandi] Yeah.
-That's so weird, he smoked. [chuckles]

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.707
[Sandi]  I think it's funny that she was
struck by the sight of him smoking,

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:02.044
and not by the fact
that someone went online

01:13:02.127 --> 01:13:04.755
and put up a Missing Persons page for him.

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:08.759
[woman]  You know, what was real
and what wasn't, I have no clue.

01:13:10.135 --> 01:13:12.930
-He did say his mother was French.
-[Sandi]  Was she?

01:13:13.013 --> 01:13:15.432
-I don't know.
- But you met her, was she French?

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:18.102
[woman]  Well, I couldn't speak to her,
she only spoke Spanish.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:22.189
He never told me he was French.
I would have remembered that.

01:13:22.272 --> 01:13:26.276
I mean, he told me
that he was born on a ship

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.613
that had departed Germany
en route for Colombia,

01:13:29.696 --> 01:13:32.825
departing Germany
because his father was German.

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:37.121
And I just accepted that as gospel
for the longest time

01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:41.625
until one day, I was having a conversation
with his niece Catalina,

01:13:41.708 --> 01:13:43.460
and she started laughing.

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:46.422
I said, "Why? What's so funny?"

01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:49.800
She says, "He told you that story too?"

01:13:50.634 --> 01:13:54.471
He was born in a little mountain village
in the hills of Colombia.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:59.351
There was always a sense
that he was not just self-conscious

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.728
about perceptions of his class,

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:03.313
but also his ethnicity.

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:06.525
He was always very vague
about his ethnicity.

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:08.110
[meows]

01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:10.696
[Stephen]  The last time
I actually spoke with Georges...

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:13.323
was sometime in the early '90s

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:16.368
and he had already moved to Singapore
and I was still here in New Orleans.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:19.371
And as was invariably the case,

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:23.500
Georges began talking about
a dream project that he was concocting.

01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:26.545
And he wanted me to be part of it,

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.755
and it was making this movie in Singapore.

01:14:32.259 --> 01:14:34.428
"Come to Singapore,
you'll be my right-hand man.

01:14:34.511 --> 01:14:36.513
We'll do this feature film in Singapore."

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:42.978
The pattern that emerges is that Georges

01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:48.066
would feel threatened
by his protégés being successful.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:53.280
And the way that he dealt
with that threat was to take action

01:14:53.363 --> 01:14:57.868
by absconding with physical manifestations
of these people's dreams.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:06.126
You know, in your case it was film,
in my case it was film and equipment.

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:10.005
Other people, it was also film,
soundtracks, whatever.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:15.677
[Sandi]  Steve and I are now forever bound,

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:20.265
not as fellow victims,
but as fellow detectives...

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:23.018
and therefore, friends.

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:28.023
I had one last shred of Georges:

01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:32.986
an old letter from Georges's mother
with a return address in Arabi,

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:34.363
outside New Orleans.

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:35.781
It's beautiful.

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:39.159
The widow tried to talk us
out of going there.

01:15:40.452 --> 01:15:42.704
[woman]
I can tell you Arabi is not pretty.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.039
-[Sandi] Okay.
-[laughing]

01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:46.875
[woman] Arabi is horrible.

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:51.380
[Sandi]  So, of course, I had to go there.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:19.032
It's not raining now so it's good.

01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:21.868
Do you need this, the matte box?

01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:26.331
[dogs barking in distance]

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:35.048
[thunder rumbling in distance]

01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:38.218
[dogs continue barking]

01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:45.100
[heavy wind blowing, leaves rustling]

01:16:45.892 --> 01:16:49.021
And this made me think
of that scene in  Blow Up,

01:16:49.896 --> 01:16:53.317
when David Hemmings returns
to the scene of the crime...

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:56.236
only to find nothing.

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:07.998
After unpeeling Georges Cardona
layer by layer,

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:12.836
I realize there's nothing there
but movies.

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:17.341
There were characters
he wanted to emulate.

01:17:18.842 --> 01:17:21.345
And there were characters
he pretended to be.

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:26.016
But the one who was closest
to who he really was...

01:17:26.099 --> 01:17:27.643
was Nosferatu.

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:31.563
Trying to become immortal...

01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:34.650
by feeding on young people's dreams.

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:40.906
Georges Cardona had his own
very bizarre love, right? For  Shirkers.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.409
I thought that when he absconded

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.620
with all of the reels

01:17:46.703 --> 01:17:50.624
that it would just be strewn outside,

01:17:50.707 --> 01:17:53.627
and the humidity
would basically eat up the film,

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:55.045
and that would be it.

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:56.880
But he loved those reels.

01:17:57.756 --> 01:18:00.592
We all fell in love with the film
in different ways,

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:03.011
and his was like, I don't know, man,

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:05.430
it was like necrophiliac. [laughs]

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.101
[Sandi]  He might have loved our reels,

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:11.603
but he threw
all the sound recordings away.

01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:17.317
Shirkers  was returned to us a mute.

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:06.366

[stuttering] Okay, I really...

01:19:09.035 --> 01:19:12.873
[stuttering] When I saw the footage,

01:19:12.956 --> 01:19:16.626
I just thought that, "Gee whiz,
this film should've been finished."

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:21.381
It would have been a rallying call
that it's okay to try anything.

You know,  Shirkers  is like the ghost

01:19:35.061 --> 01:19:39.441
in between the lines of books
written on Singapore film history,

01:19:39.524 --> 01:19:44.154
and for me,  Shirkers
has this very palpable absence.

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:47.991
And I have this voice going, "No, no, no,

01:19:48.074 --> 01:19:49.785

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:55.707

I felt like a crazy person

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.251
talking about this film that didn't exist.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.129
But I was vindicated.

01:20:01.713 --> 01:20:05.592
Everyone I remembered being fantastic
was fantastic.

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:19.064
And I was as rotten as I thought I was.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:25.111
There were so many surprises
in this time capsule.

01:20:26.112 --> 01:20:28.323

01:22:29.235 --> 01:22:32.280

I was taking her back to New York.

01:22:41.414 --> 01:22:43.750
Maybe not the same New York she once knew.

01:22:45.001 --> 01:22:47.587
But she wasn't the same person
anymore either.

01:22:51.758 --> 01:22:53.927

01:23:12.278 --> 01:23:13.655

You are not a camel.

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:32.882
It's not heavy. I'm holding it.

01:23:33.299 --> 01:23:34.634
[Sandi]  She was right.

01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:36.845

Jasmine had just made what is still

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:52.360
the most adventurous movie
ever created in Singapore.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.202
Let's rock!

01:24:15.258 --> 01:24:20.013
[Sandi]  Of the three of us, Jasmine is
the only one who still lives in Singapore.

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:25.643
And she's the noblest of us by far.

01:24:26.269 --> 01:24:29.898
And this is to raise awareness
for the screenwriters, yeah!

01:24:33.359 --> 01:24:35.361
-[boy] Like that?
-Like that.

01:24:35.779 --> 01:24:37.363
Say, "Writers unite!"

01:24:37.447 --> 01:24:39.157
-Writers unite!
-Yeah!

wherever she sees it.

01:24:44.287 --> 01:24:47.707
We still grab lunch
whenever we're in the same city,

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:51.461
and we still ambush our friend Yek Keak
who never leaves his home.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:52.921
Yek Keak!

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:55.632
You guys, come on in.

01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:57.425
Uh, and then we'll probably cut.

01:24:57.509 --> 01:25:00.595
Because we have to clear the studio room
and reset our blocking.

01:25:00.845 --> 01:25:02.639
Whenever you're ready. Rolling?

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:08.186
[Sandi]  But whenever  Shirkers  comes up,
even after all these years,

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:12.398
we descend into the same circle of hell.

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:17.695
This is so typically you that you're gonna
put everybody under the magnifying glass

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:21.407
and put everyone in a little glass tank
terrarium except yourself.

01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:24.119

do these things, you always--

Because this is like for your amusement.

How many times can I keep telling you
that it was extremely annoying

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:36.589
and it was extremely disappointing
and it was extremely draining

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:40.009
and that it was the relationships
that drained

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:45.098
and not the production itself
that exhausted us?

01:25:47.725 --> 01:25:48.643
Thank you.

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.857
This 23-year battle...

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:56.818
um, is a double-edged sword for me,

01:25:56.901 --> 01:25:57.986
because...

01:25:58.361 --> 01:26:01.739
uh, you and Jasmine and I
are bonded in a way

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:04.701
that I don't share a bond
with anyone else.

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:07.662
I don't have to talk to you every day.

01:26:07.912 --> 01:26:11.249
I don't have to talk to you, you know,
on a regular basis,

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:14.878
but there is that instant sort of
very visceral and emotional connection.

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:20.216
You gave me this notebook
when you arrived.

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.678
So I have I have not seen this
for 23 years.

01:26:23.761 --> 01:26:25.763
-This is your notebook.
-This is my notebook.

01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:30.018
So I'm analyzing
and breaking down the script

01:26:30.101 --> 01:26:33.188
for, like, symbolism
and metaphor and allusions.

01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:39.027
This notebook
contains the kernel for my profession,

01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:40.069

right, for subtext.

actually in the fall for three years.

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.638

Making this film, I've come to realize

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:36.542
that Georges's ghost
will never truly leave me.

01:27:38.169 --> 01:27:39.587
And I've learned to think:

01:27:40.838 --> 01:27:41.923
"That's okay."

01:27:43.549 --> 01:27:47.136
[Georges]  Let's wait for the other side.
And see what it brings.

01:27:57.355 --> 01:28:00.817

that Georges stole from him.

[humming]

01:28:05.154 --> 01:28:06.656

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:09.367
why don't you just play it for me?

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:37.455
[Jasmine]  You have this affection towards
the film because of the time in your life.

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.957
You know, we laughed about it,
we cried about it,

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.376
we bitched about it.

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.837
[Sophie]  It's strange
because it doesn't exist as a film,

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:46.255
and yet it does.

01:29:46.339 --> 01:29:49.217
Right? It exists here for me
and exists here.

01:29:50.301 --> 01:29:54.764
And so what you're doing
is not bringing  Shirkers  back to life

01:29:54.847 --> 01:29:56.808
but giving it an afterlife...

01:29:57.475 --> 01:29:58.684
