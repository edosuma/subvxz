WEBVTT

00:02.469 --> 00:05.604
Right there was a real Haitian
"Mommie Dearest" shit show.

00:05.606 --> 00:06.939
Desna is very important to me.

00:06.941 --> 00:08.473
She's important to me, as well.

00:08.475 --> 00:10.142
Them Russkies took
everything we got.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.343
We gotta do something.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.344
I know you love me.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.813
You're drunk.
Absolutely not. See?

00:14.815 --> 00:17.415
Get to a meeting, Jennifer.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.151
You filthy little skank.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.486
Marnie, who's your new friend?
This is Malik.

00:21.488 --> 00:22.621
He's really interesting.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.689
You can choose
to be a boy to your mama

00:24.691 --> 00:26.224
or you can be a man to me.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.761
You need to show Hussers
that you are a boss.

00:28.763 --> 00:31.964
You need to teach them a lesson,
like I say in my book.

00:31.966 --> 00:33.832
You're gonna make
an incredible wife.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.968
Arlene's getting
a warrant to arrest us.

00:35.970 --> 00:37.502
You're stilling dating that cop?

00:37.504 --> 00:38.771
I love her, Polly. Love?

00:38.773 --> 00:41.506
What's love got to do with it?
You know better.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.575
We're talking about
having a kid.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.477
End this shit, Ann.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:00.126 --> 01:02.060
Yes, this is Ann Zayas.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.062
This is the Department
of Children and Families,

01:04.063 --> 01:05.730
and we were wondering
if you could come in.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.399
My God. Today?

01:07.401 --> 01:09.201
Um...

01:09.203 --> 01:11.536
We have a baby
for you and your partner.

01:11.538 --> 01:14.006
Um...

01:14.008 --> 01:17.009
We won't be able to make it.

01:17.011 --> 01:18.477
Um...

01:19.946 --> 01:21.613
She and I
aren't together anymore.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.015
Okay.

01:23.017 --> 01:26.150
If something changes,
let us know.

01:26.152 --> 01:27.152
Bye.

01:32.827 --> 01:34.893
Okay.

01:42.036 --> 01:44.236
They call me Quiet Ann
because I don't talk much,

01:44.238 --> 01:46.371
but it doesn't mean
I don't have a voice.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.373
Whether or not I'm heard, well,

01:48.375 --> 01:50.709
that's another story.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.914
"Hey, girl.
Listen, can I borrow $10?"

01:55.916 --> 01:59.384
"Ann. Hey, babe.
Listen, can you please..."

01:59.386 --> 02:00.919
"I need you to pick up
some foot scrub"

02:00.921 --> 02:02.921
and sparkling cider
for the spa day.

02:02.923 --> 02:06.124
"Ooh. Don't forget to get
the grapefruit scrub."

02:06.126 --> 02:09.027
When did I go
from badass to errand boy?

02:21.942 --> 02:24.609
Hey. Surfer Ann.

02:24.611 --> 02:25.944
Hey, Homeless Jim.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.212
Don't ask to use my shower

02:27.214 --> 02:28.747
on the worst day
of my friggin' life.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.884
Mind if I, hop into your shower?

02:31.886 --> 02:33.752
Sure.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.021
Use my conditioner, you die.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.824
Thank you.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.760
You can get through this, Ann.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.562
You're fine.

03:06.386 --> 03:09.722
And I interviewed some
really good doctor candidates

03:09.724 --> 03:11.990
for the new clinics. Perfect.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.160
Mnh, mnh.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.265
Permits for
the new clinic construction.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.602
I wonder if Zlata's
ever been with a woman.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.937
Answer is yes.

03:24.939 --> 03:28.140
Wh...? Can this bitch read minds?

03:28.142 --> 03:29.341
Excuse me?

03:30.411 --> 03:32.611
Yes, you can go now.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.946
Okay, bitch.

03:33.948 --> 03:36.281
The stuff you texted me
about is in the van.

03:36.283 --> 03:39.551
Okay. Well, I'm gonna
finish up with Zlata first,

03:39.553 --> 03:41.754
and then I'll ride back
to the salon with you.

03:41.756 --> 03:45.090
You don't need to explain
yourself to subordinates.

03:50.965 --> 03:53.565
And it has come to my attention

03:53.567 --> 03:57.502
that some of you are overdoing
it with the spray tanning.

03:57.504 --> 03:58.903
I won't name any names...

03:58.905 --> 04:00.773
Sweetback!

04:00.775 --> 04:02.975
Let's just go easy, all right?

04:02.977 --> 04:06.244
There's a cheese element,
and I don't like cheese.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.981
How's it going with the boys?
It's going great.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.784
XXL here gave one of his clients
a happy ending

04:11.786 --> 04:13.518
and received quite a tip!

04:13.520 --> 04:16.988
Yes? Clap!

04:16.991 --> 04:19.123
Yes.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.125
And once
Zlata found out about that,

04:21.127 --> 04:23.728
she decided that all the boys
needed to branch out

04:23.730 --> 04:24.797
into the escort arts.

04:24.799 --> 04:27.666
Look. There's
a whole menu of prices.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.735
Well, makes sense.
These are trying economic times.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.805
Ever since
Zlata made me a madam,

04:32.807 --> 04:34.807
I've just had
a ton of work to do.

04:34.809 --> 04:37.009
Sexual gratification of women

04:37.011 --> 04:40.212
is a complex subject,
as you well know.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.613
Polly? Sorry.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.748
C-Could you explain
the "happy ending"?

04:43.750 --> 04:45.950
I'm not familiar
with that choreography.

04:47.688 --> 04:51.623
You just focus
on the dance, Dean.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.291
When I spoke to your sister,

04:53.293 --> 04:55.960
I reassured her that
you would only be dancing.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.295
So you are not
to concern yourself

04:57.297 --> 04:59.231
with the selling
of the party drugs

04:59.233 --> 05:04.302
and providing full service
to the ladies.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.504
You understand?

05:05.506 --> 05:06.705
Yeah. Yeah.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.106
Yeah, Dean, my happy ending

05:08.108 --> 05:09.974
was ruined
saving your sister's ass.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.911
Now I spend my nights jacking
off to fitness magazines.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.180
Back to work. Back to work!

05:15.182 --> 05:17.115
I got
a good mind to slit her throat

05:17.117 --> 05:18.717
and watch her choke
on the blood.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.984
We gotta talk strategy.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.786
What are those miscreants up to?

05:21.788 --> 05:23.922
Hey. Quiet Puerto RicAnn.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.858
I'm Cuban.

05:25.860 --> 05:27.526
Quiet CubAnn. It still works.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.396
I'ma drop this off.
I need a ride to the plaza.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.731
Nice!

05:32.733 --> 05:35.600
Now I'm driving Miss Desna
and the loudmouth redneck.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.402
How's it feel
being Zlata's bitch?

05:37.404 --> 05:38.670
I'm her lieutenant.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.138
No, you're her bitch.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.207
It's eatin' me alive.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.743
Can't sleep.
Can't hardly breathe.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.011
He'd never make it
as a minority.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.013
Gotta relax, Clay.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.816
Zlats may seem crazy,
but she's got a plan.

05:51.818 --> 05:53.618
Zlata is crazy.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.953
Why can't you see it?!

05:54.955 --> 05:56.889
I need a plan.

05:56.891 --> 06:01.159
I need to get shit together
so I can rise up.

06:01.161 --> 06:04.629
Rise up like... you know,
like... Ike Turner.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.765
Nat Turner. Dumbass.

06:08.302 --> 06:12.036
We all gotta rise up, put that
stroganoff-eatin' bitch down.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.239
We agreed to make this work.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.308
When the new clinics are open,

06:16.310 --> 06:19.177
the businesses will be
even more profitable.

06:22.116 --> 06:24.382
Did you see that shit?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.585
I'ma teach this son of a bitch
a little lesson.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.887
Clay... Whoa!

06:39.866 --> 06:41.066
Heh-heh! Really?

06:42.469 --> 06:44.469
Was that really necessary?

06:44.471 --> 06:45.537
Damn sure was.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.406
On top of that, it felt good.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.674
Only a white guy can assault
someone in broad daylight

06:49.676 --> 06:51.676
and just saunter back
to the car.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.678
So after they left
the amphitheater,

06:53.680 --> 06:56.681
she followed the tour bus
on her Rascal.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.416
Unh-unh!

06:58.418 --> 06:59.818
Hey, y'all.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.887
Shit.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.489
I'm sorry. You okay?

07:04.491 --> 07:07.292
Yeah. I'm just having a klutzy
day, is all.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.694
Shit. She's been drinking.

07:09.696 --> 07:12.297
Keep it together. Okay.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.232
You know, she caught up
with the band at the hotel.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.101
Your grandma did?

07:16.103 --> 07:17.970
She gave 'em some
of her moonshine,

07:17.972 --> 07:20.438
and they raved about it
on social media.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.106
Now it sells out.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.909
We just bought a house on Bayshore.
Look at you.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.779
Where's Virginia? Wait for it.

07:26.781 --> 07:29.381
She's out back, taking
topless selfies for Dean.

07:29.383 --> 07:31.516
I miss Arlene's topless selfies.

07:31.518 --> 07:34.252
She don't even have nothing
to put in a top.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.988
I need this morning
to go perfect.

07:35.990 --> 07:37.656
Gregory's mama is coming in.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.395
That made me so sad.

07:43.397 --> 07:45.063
I just hurt my own feelings.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.531
It's too soon.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.732
Look.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.803
The situation with your mama
is over, girl.

07:50.805 --> 07:53.138
It's time to move on. All right?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.540
"Wallowing is like sitting
in a rocking chair.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.342
It's not gonna get you nowhere."

07:57.344 --> 07:58.410
That's in Zlata's...

07:58.412 --> 08:00.945
Zlata's book. Yeah.
Zlata's book.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.614
Don't hate 'cause I read.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.484
Zlata, Zlata.
That book is a joke.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.886
Ann, can you please
come and rub my neck?

08:07.888 --> 08:10.222
My shoulders are so tight.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.960
Sure, Des.

08:15.962 --> 08:17.362
Thank you.

08:17.364 --> 08:20.699
And, um, clean out the bowls
on the pedi loungers.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.635
Of course! I mean,
that's what I do. Right?

08:23.637 --> 08:25.303
Well, why don't you just
go ahead

08:25.305 --> 08:27.906
and check your titties
while I'm at it?

08:32.513 --> 08:33.645
Can I help you?

08:33.647 --> 08:37.381
Yes. I just need
to speak to my sister.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.451
What the hell
are you doing here, bro?

08:49.396 --> 08:51.263
L-L-Let's talk outside. Okay.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.465
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:53.467 --> 08:56.601
Aren't you gonna...
introduce us?

08:56.603 --> 08:59.003
Henry, this is everybody.

08:59.005 --> 09:01.740
Hi. Hey! Will you look at
these thirsty bitches.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.942
It's almost like
she's ashamed of us.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.278
You are the congressman?

09:06.280 --> 09:07.946
State senator.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.549
Yes.
- -Nice to meet you.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.484
That's when I found out
the Nation of Islam

09:12.486 --> 09:13.818
forbids interracial sex,

09:13.820 --> 09:15.487
so Malik and I
can only be study buddies.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.689
Malik from Shrimp Town?

09:17.691 --> 09:19.157
Yeah. He's the wokest.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.027
Sweetie, y'all have known
each other for two minutes.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.097
I know. But he's guiding me
through the teachings.

09:25.099 --> 09:28.433
I'm already halfway through
the Quran, which is so amazing.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.102
It's like he knows me
better than anyone.

09:30.104 --> 09:33.105
Poor Polly. She's losing her.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.641
No! Hell no!

09:36.643 --> 09:37.776
Are you cr... It's his birthday.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.912
I don't care! Come on, Annie.

09:39.914 --> 09:41.179
No!

09:41.181 --> 09:42.847
You know, Dad's not gonna
be around forever.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.849
I'm counting on that.

09:44.851 --> 09:48.520
I know it's been a while
since we've talked, but come on,

09:48.522 --> 09:50.855
You haven't seen any of us
in four years.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.791
Can't you at least
come to dinner?

09:52.793 --> 09:53.926
No.

09:53.928 --> 09:55.994
They've mellowed out
in their old age.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.132
They're really not
as bad as you remember.

10:00.134 --> 10:02.735
Plus, I need you
to be my wingman.

10:02.737 --> 10:03.936
Yeah, w...

10:03.938 --> 10:05.971
Your boyfriend
should be your wingman.

10:06.941 --> 10:09.608
You know
that's never gonna happen.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.744
You can't be a gay senator
in Florida.

10:11.746 --> 10:13.412
So, I get shunned
by the parents,

10:13.414 --> 10:15.447
and you get to be
the golden boy.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.817
Can't you just come tonight?

10:18.819 --> 10:20.018
For me?

10:20.020 --> 10:22.154
I wonder if he remembers
when I made him.

10:22.156 --> 10:23.822
Wonder Woman bracelets.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.591
I miss those days.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.560
I do miss you, man.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.696
So you'll be there?

10:34.701 --> 10:36.501
Fine.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.569
I'll be there.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.304
Thank you.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.239
Mwah! Thank you. Mwah!
Get off me.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.241
Politician. Full of shit.

10:44.445 --> 10:46.445
We were running behind.

10:46.447 --> 10:47.646
Is everything okay?

10:51.652 --> 10:52.917
Welcome.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.187
And, good to see you
again, Madame.

10:55.189 --> 10:58.657
You can choose whatever color
you want for your manicure.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.192
My station is right here.

11:00.194 --> 11:01.560
Merci.

11:03.397 --> 11:05.464
So, I heard
you have some opinions

11:05.466 --> 11:08.000
about Gregory and me.

11:08.002 --> 11:09.468
Yeah. Um...

11:09.470 --> 11:12.204
Look, I know
you guys are close...

11:12.206 --> 11:13.672
I've spoken to my son,

11:13.674 --> 11:16.541
and I believe
I actually understand

11:16.543 --> 11:18.276
where you are coming from.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.012
Um...

11:20.014 --> 11:22.815
Okay. Well, that is...
good to hear.

11:22.817 --> 11:24.549
Hello, my friends.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.284
Ecch. Putin's in the house.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.820
I have emergency nail situation.

11:27.822 --> 11:29.754
I lost some stones.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.756
Madame Ruval, this is Zlata.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.359
She owns the place.
This is Gregory's mother.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.429
I like this.

11:37.431 --> 11:40.232
Lots of boss ladies.

11:40.234 --> 11:41.834
Yes!

11:41.836 --> 11:43.635
Pleasure. Pleasure.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.770
Is true... I own salon,

11:45.772 --> 11:49.574
but Desna is kind of
a... sister-friend.

11:49.576 --> 11:53.978
Wow. Three weeks with Zlata,
and now they're sister-friends?

11:53.980 --> 11:56.181
Madame Ruval and Gregory
are sponsoring

11:56.183 --> 11:58.383
these young girls from Haiti.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.984
Great.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.986
So many kids who need homes.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.522
Keep it together, Ann.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.194
Ann. Let me talk to you
for a second.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.395
I'll be right back.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.532
Okay, this is good.

12:13.534 --> 12:16.468
Now Des sees that I'm hanging
on by a Band-Aid and a dream.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.871
I need you to take
the books over to the clinic

12:18.873 --> 12:21.139
and then get down to
the new site and, um,

12:21.141 --> 12:22.941
incentivize the crew.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.346
Surprise, surprise...
She didn't notice.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.359
Pfft.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.562
Afternoon, boys.

12:43.564 --> 12:44.697
You having fun?

12:44.699 --> 12:46.498
Can you please get your guys up?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.033
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

12:49.035 --> 12:51.169
Get your guys to work!

12:56.243 --> 12:57.642
Get back to work!

12:57.644 --> 12:59.244
Get back to work!

12:59.246 --> 13:00.379
Move!

13:00.381 --> 13:02.014
Back to work!

13:20.066 --> 13:21.266
Shit.

13:28.142 --> 13:29.608
Hey, there.

13:29.610 --> 13:32.010
You got any big ribbons?

13:32.012 --> 13:33.745
Can't you read, girl?

13:33.747 --> 13:36.815
I got a big set of keys,
clown shoes, and...

13:36.817 --> 13:39.818
'course, I also got
a great, big, hard...

13:39.820 --> 13:41.153
Yeah, not my jam.

13:41.155 --> 13:43.422
You got a problem
with giant lollipops?

13:43.424 --> 13:46.291
Put your pops away, Jimmy.
All I need is the ribbon.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.196
So, what's this for, anyway?

13:52.899 --> 13:55.233
We're opening a pain clinic.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.703
What, pill mill
or physical therapy?

13:58.705 --> 14:00.572
Aren't you full of questions.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.240
The former.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.042
A ribbon cutting
for a pill mill?

14:04.044 --> 14:06.712
Yeah. Owners are Russian.

14:07.782 --> 14:08.947
Say no more.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.786
You know,
Little Jimmy's Big Stuff's

14:13.788 --> 14:15.520
got a deal
for your little stuff.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.521
Do ya?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.790
30 Oxys...

14:17.792 --> 14:19.458
and all the ribbons you want.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.860
I'll even throw in
some big-ass scissors.

14:21.862 --> 14:22.961
How big?

14:24.598 --> 14:25.898
This big.

14:31.405 --> 14:32.638
Wha...

14:34.675 --> 14:37.542
O-O-Okay! O... Okay!

14:37.544 --> 14:38.811
What'd you do that for?

14:38.813 --> 14:41.013
Well, you wanted pills.
Now you're in pain.

14:41.015 --> 14:43.215
Stop by the clinic.
We'll hook you up.

14:43.217 --> 14:44.917
On the house.

14:46.487 --> 14:48.553
Thank you?

14:55.162 --> 14:57.429
Mother Russia's still here?!

14:57.431 --> 15:00.833
At least she bought food.

15:00.835 --> 15:03.101
Seriously?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.903
Y'all didn't save me any shrimp?

15:04.905 --> 15:07.572
Sorry.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.641
Our bad. It was good, too, girl.

15:09.643 --> 15:12.777
What was it you said
your last boyfriend did?

15:12.779 --> 15:15.848
I didn't, but...
since you asked...

15:15.850 --> 15:17.516
he was in sales.

15:18.519 --> 15:20.785
Yep. He was a salesman.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.788
And you two were serious?

15:23.790 --> 15:26.725
Well, I would say
that we were...

15:26.727 --> 15:28.126
No.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.728
And you've never been married?

15:29.730 --> 15:32.597
Well, you know, Des has been
real... busy working...

15:32.599 --> 15:34.533
You know,
and taking care of Dean.

15:34.535 --> 15:35.868
Now that's my job.

15:35.870 --> 15:38.403
The... Taking care of Dean,
not the working.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.405
We know, sugar.

15:41.876 --> 15:46.144
A woman your age never married?

15:46.146 --> 15:48.213
Talk me through it.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.683
Desna very strong personality.

15:50.685 --> 15:52.350
Men are intimidate.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.418
Look, I don't know.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.288
I... never really
thought about it.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.290
I mean,
I grew up in foster care,

15:58.292 --> 16:00.893
and that's not exactly
the best example of men,

16:00.895 --> 16:02.627
if you know what I'm sayin'.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.697
But you are open to marriage?

16:04.699 --> 16:06.831
I-I guess. I-I don't know.

16:06.833 --> 16:10.302
I-I'm sorry.
Why all the questions, Madame?

16:11.105 --> 16:13.838
If my only son
is going to marry you,

16:13.840 --> 16:18.377
I need to know
that you are worthy.

16:18.379 --> 16:19.511
Say what, now?

16:22.649 --> 16:25.718
So, I lose Arlene
and Desna gets the fairy tale.

16:25.720 --> 16:26.919
Perfect.

16:31.892 --> 16:34.893
Can y'all believe that I...

16:34.895 --> 16:36.828
am about to marry a doctor?!

16:36.830 --> 16:38.029
Yass!

16:38.031 --> 16:39.898
Wait a minute.
With a damn yacht.

16:39.900 --> 16:41.633
Right? Loves his mama.

16:41.635 --> 16:44.035
- Okay.
- And rescues girls from Haiti.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.305
Come on, now! Okurrr!

16:46.307 --> 16:49.108
God.
I wish I were happy for her.

16:49.110 --> 16:50.842
I am so not.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.178
I just... I gotta say it.
Just... Just say it.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.846
You really struck gold
this time, Des.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.182
Right? He doesn't sell drugs.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.249
- Like Roller.
- Like Roller.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.651
He doesn't take you for granted.

16:59.653 --> 17:01.452
- Like Roller.
- Like Roller.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.123
And he lets you know
how he feels about you.

17:04.125 --> 17:06.057
Unlike Roller!

17:07.260 --> 17:08.527
That's right, girl.

17:08.529 --> 17:11.329
Say goodbye to bad choices
and bad boys.

17:11.332 --> 17:12.864
For real.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.934
I mean, y'all, I got a good one this time.
What I know.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.403
Why is it I can fight off
190-pound prison heifers

17:18.405 --> 17:20.539
and I can't speak my mind
to Des?

17:20.540 --> 17:24.943
Y'all know how many black women
my age are still single?

17:24.944 --> 17:26.011
All of them.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.479
Boom. Okay?

17:27.481 --> 17:30.415
I never thought
this was gonna happen for me.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.484
All right, y'all.
Let's put 'em up for Des.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.553
All right? To Desi.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.021
Ayy!

17:36.023 --> 17:37.222
Ayy! Ayy! Ayy!

17:37.224 --> 17:39.090
This could've been me.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.159
All right.

17:40.161 --> 17:41.426
Finally! Yeah!

18:00.581 --> 18:01.847
Ayy!

18:01.849 --> 18:02.848
Heh-heh-hey!

18:02.850 --> 18:04.583
Okay, okay. That was real cute.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.918
What's that... from, like,
the olden days or something?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.988
Ooh! Block her out.
Block her out. Block her out.

18:09.990 --> 18:11.523
Dean!

18:12.593 --> 18:13.592
No!

18:13.594 --> 18:14.726
Waaaaa!

18:14.728 --> 18:15.861
Yeah!

18:15.863 --> 18:17.462
Stop it!

18:17.464 --> 18:19.064
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Get it, boy!

18:19.066 --> 18:20.599
Okay, I said you can dance,

18:20.601 --> 18:22.601
but I don't want to see it
all up in my kitchen.

18:22.603 --> 18:23.802
Shoo, fly! Shoo!

18:23.804 --> 18:26.738
Fine. Fine,
I'll perfect my moves outside.

18:26.740 --> 18:27.939
My God!

18:27.941 --> 18:29.007
I'm coming, boo.

18:29.009 --> 18:30.475
Well done!

18:30.477 --> 18:32.143
You taught him?

18:33.146 --> 18:35.280
You guys, I gotta run.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.216
Zlata needs me.

18:37.218 --> 18:38.550
- Right now?
- Yeah.

18:38.552 --> 18:41.152
- Why?
- It's a management thing.

18:42.223 --> 18:43.822
But stay and eat the food.

18:43.824 --> 18:46.491
I mean, she already paid
for everything, so... enjoy it.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.893
I'll see y'all later.

18:47.895 --> 18:49.360
Okay.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.962
Bye, girl, bye.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.298
Virginia and Desna...
They need to be prepared.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.234
'Cause having a man around 24/7

18:55.236 --> 18:57.769
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

18:57.771 --> 19:00.371
Ken... he leaves
his little, tiny hairs

19:00.373 --> 19:03.842
from when he shaves
all over the damn sink!

19:03.844 --> 19:05.577
That's why I date women.

19:07.114 --> 19:09.648
I need some space!

19:09.650 --> 19:12.384
Dean, what is the problem?

19:14.655 --> 19:16.055
Hey, y'all.

19:16.057 --> 19:17.656
What's going on out here?

19:17.658 --> 19:20.191
I was just running some ideas
by him about his routine,

19:20.193 --> 19:21.460
and he got all upset.

19:21.462 --> 19:23.328
I-I told you I wanted
to rehearse in private.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.796
You didn't listen.

19:24.798 --> 19:26.531
Now you're in my space,
telling me what to do.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.101
Yeah.
I know how that feels, man.

19:31.072 --> 19:32.938
I said that out loud.

19:32.940 --> 19:35.006
I am s... I'm sorry.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.476
Look, I wasn't trying
to tell you what to do, Dean.

19:37.478 --> 19:39.278
I just noticed that
your twerking was a little off.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.479
I'm just trying to help.

19:40.481 --> 19:42.013
I don't need your help.

19:42.015 --> 19:45.016
A-And your shampoo's offending
my olfactory receptors.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.285
My what?

19:46.287 --> 19:47.552
You guys need to focus
on the shit

19:47.554 --> 19:49.154
that's good
in your relationship, okay?

19:49.156 --> 19:50.422
Instead of focusing on bullshit

19:50.424 --> 19:52.023
that doesn't even matter!

19:52.025 --> 19:54.225
No, don't scream.
N-No screaming.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.494
Now I need kombucha.

19:55.496 --> 19:58.229
Sorry. Sorry, Deanie. No.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.037
You know that I find myself...

20:06.039 --> 20:08.707
I have to work twice as hard
to be in half the shape.

20:08.709 --> 20:11.442
As if my night
couldn't get any worse,

20:11.444 --> 20:13.112
welcome to the Shit-show Grille.

20:13.114 --> 20:15.114
The rest of your party
has already been seated.

20:15.116 --> 20:16.348
Hi.

20:17.918 --> 20:19.151
You're late.

20:20.721 --> 20:21.820
Hey.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.662
Mijo, you gave 'em hell on that.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.398
- Senator's job.
- Don't be so modest.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.467
You know the Democrats
aren't working half as hard.

20:35.469 --> 20:37.469
Ooh. Here it comes...
Inmigración.

20:37.471 --> 20:38.603
Wait for it.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.271
Wait for it.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.207
Don't get me started
on immigrants.

20:42.209 --> 20:44.609
It's like the Democrats don't
want to empower the police

20:44.611 --> 20:45.877
to deal with the illegals.

20:45.879 --> 20:47.479
Papi, you know you sound like

20:47.481 --> 20:49.815
those crazy white racists,
right?

20:49.817 --> 20:51.550
Don't call your father crazy.

20:51.552 --> 20:54.153
Mami, we're immigrants. Come on.

20:54.155 --> 20:55.754
We're not immigrants.

20:55.756 --> 20:58.357
We're exiles.
There's a difference.

20:58.359 --> 21:00.759
Did tío Ignacio
come here legally?

21:00.761 --> 21:02.227
Or tia Nona or Pucci?

21:02.229 --> 21:05.430
The point is, not everybody
has the luxury of time.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.699
Some people are
in desperate situations.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.300
How do you guys not get that?

21:09.302 --> 21:10.902
How do you not get that?

21:10.904 --> 21:13.172
People have to be responsible
for their own well-being.

21:13.174 --> 21:15.640
You can't just pile onto a boat

21:15.642 --> 21:19.310
or trek across the desert
into America illegally.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.979
That's just not how it works.

21:20.981 --> 21:22.581
It does! It does.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.183
If you don't have the time
to wait for a visa

21:24.185 --> 21:28.554
because your country's being
ravaged by war and corruption...

21:30.992 --> 21:32.924
- How about some dessert?
- I see.

21:32.926 --> 21:35.994
Rhubarb pie? Crème brûlée?
Chocolate custard?

21:35.996 --> 21:37.062
Are you on the menu?

21:37.064 --> 21:39.998
You're gaaaaaaaaaaaaay!

21:40.000 --> 21:41.400
You're such a hound dog.

21:41.402 --> 21:43.802
I'm sorry.
She's just so beautiful.

21:43.804 --> 21:46.004
Thank you. I don't mind.

21:46.006 --> 21:50.475
We'll have two rhubarb pies
and two crème brûlées,

21:50.477 --> 21:52.544
s'il vous plaît.

21:52.546 --> 21:54.213
French.

21:54.215 --> 21:57.749
So, I have
an announcement to make.

21:57.751 --> 22:00.018
IAy! iFinalmente!
You're getting married.

22:00.020 --> 22:01.286
Ha!

22:01.288 --> 22:02.921
I'm running for governor.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.626
That's outstanding!

22:07.628 --> 22:09.628
Have you shored up
your donor base?

22:09.630 --> 22:11.763
Working on it as we speak.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.632
Now, my platform
supports a hard line

22:13.634 --> 22:15.834
on drugs and prostitution
in the state.

22:15.836 --> 22:18.503
He just described
a Tuesday in my world.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.772
We're so proud of you, mijo.

22:26.447 --> 22:28.781
But you don't even know him.

22:30.251 --> 22:31.917
So, Annalisa,

22:31.919 --> 22:35.721
are you still doing security
for that hair salon?

22:35.723 --> 22:37.188
You know it's a nail salon.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.657
Yep.

22:38.659 --> 22:40.792
Why do you continue
to waste your life there?

22:40.794 --> 22:43.595
You speak five languages.
You have a degree.

22:43.597 --> 22:44.930
You could do so much more.

22:44.932 --> 22:46.665
You have to want more
to do more.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.133
I'm so sorry... when was it

22:48.135 --> 22:50.069
that you asked me what I wanted?

22:50.071 --> 22:52.004
Mama, give her a break.

22:54.675 --> 22:57.408
We spoke to Freddy
the other day.

22:57.410 --> 23:00.279
You know, we've stayed in touch
since you went away.

23:00.281 --> 23:01.813
"Went away"?

23:01.815 --> 23:04.816
Jail. Prison. Penitentiary.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.085
Not that any of you visited.

23:06.087 --> 23:08.219
Your ex-husband is a good man.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.089
And available.

23:10.091 --> 23:11.690
Maybe try to reconnect.

23:11.692 --> 23:13.825
They'll never understand me.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.295
Any man who forgives you for
trying to kill his girlfriend

23:16.297 --> 23:18.630
with a broken beer bottle
is a keeper.

23:18.632 --> 23:20.165
Mami, you know I'm a dyke!

23:20.167 --> 23:21.167
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

23:22.569 --> 23:24.703
You know what?

23:24.705 --> 23:26.505
I need a moment.

23:27.975 --> 23:30.676
And she was my girlfriend.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.648
She needs a moment.

23:43.190 --> 23:45.190
Rrgh!

24:25.699 --> 24:27.632
Hey, baby. It's me.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.835
The social worker's
coming to visit.

24:29.837 --> 24:33.572
The adoption is so close,
I can feel it.

24:33.574 --> 24:36.107
You're gonna make a great mom.

24:59.199 --> 25:00.865
Where have you been?

25:01.868 --> 25:03.602
I smell burnt rope.

25:04.605 --> 25:06.872
That's right. I'm lit.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.874
Would you calm down?

25:09.876 --> 25:12.210
No. I won't. I will not.

25:12.212 --> 25:14.212
All of you have been trying
to keep me quiet

25:14.214 --> 25:16.849
and crush my spirit for years.

25:17.818 --> 25:20.619
No, we did not
crush your spirit.

25:21.756 --> 25:24.556
No, Mami. That was you!
You did that.

25:24.558 --> 25:26.558
Senator Zayas, photograph?

25:30.230 --> 25:33.666
No. See? "Sit down. Be quiet.
Stay in the closet."

25:35.436 --> 25:36.901
No more.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.037
He's gay.

25:46.847 --> 25:48.781
So, isn't anybody
gonna say anything?

25:48.783 --> 25:51.483
We don't give two shits
that he's gay!

25:53.253 --> 25:54.453
I'm sorry... what?

25:55.522 --> 25:57.456
What the hell
are you talking about?

25:57.458 --> 26:00.192
You ghosted
the minute I came out.

26:00.194 --> 26:01.726
No, no, no, no.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.928
We "ghosted" because
you tried to kill someone

26:03.930 --> 26:05.464
and went to prison.

26:05.466 --> 26:06.731
And when you did get out,

26:06.733 --> 26:08.467
you refused to live up
to your potential.

26:08.469 --> 26:11.603
Well, it's... kinda hard
to go the tenure track

26:11.605 --> 26:12.805
when you got a criminal record.

26:12.807 --> 26:14.606
I'm sure you can do better

26:14.608 --> 26:17.609
than sitting on a box with a bat
in a rundown salon.

26:17.611 --> 26:18.943
But our disappointment in you

26:18.945 --> 26:20.913
has nothing to do
with you being gay.

26:24.018 --> 26:25.617
Everyone's gay!

26:25.619 --> 26:28.420
I'm gay.
Your father's gay. Yeah.

26:28.422 --> 26:30.122
What is happening right now?

26:32.026 --> 26:33.425
Excuse me?

26:38.699 --> 26:42.300
Your father and I have been
each other's beards for years.

26:42.302 --> 26:45.004
Did you think Aunt Cecilia
was your actual aunt?

26:46.773 --> 26:48.040
My God.

26:48.042 --> 26:50.642
You just don't
have to tell everyone.

26:50.644 --> 26:52.044
When I was growing up,

26:52.046 --> 26:55.047
gay people
were beaten and tortured.

26:55.049 --> 26:57.649
It's different now.
You can be out.

26:57.651 --> 26:59.317
Are you out of your damn mind?

26:59.319 --> 27:01.186
It's not that different.

27:01.188 --> 27:04.322
Now, we're counting on you
to at least stay quiet

27:04.324 --> 27:05.791
where we're concerned.

27:06.993 --> 27:07.993
Okay?

27:22.142 --> 27:24.142
My God.

27:24.144 --> 27:26.611
I haven't pulled an all-nighter
since college.

27:29.416 --> 27:30.615
Man.

27:30.617 --> 27:32.551
My God!

27:32.553 --> 27:35.287
And Papi with
all the El Puma posters.

27:39.226 --> 27:40.825
Right?

27:40.827 --> 27:42.961
My God. It all makes sense now.

27:44.498 --> 27:46.831
Hey, listen.

27:48.102 --> 27:52.837
I'm sorry I haven't been
more supportive of you.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.440
You're brave.

27:55.442 --> 27:58.643
And I'm... not.

28:02.116 --> 28:04.048
I am not brave.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.118
I have plans, you know...

28:06.120 --> 28:08.720
Beyond running for governor.

28:08.722 --> 28:11.523
I'm talking the Oval Office.

28:11.525 --> 28:12.925
Shit.

28:14.929 --> 28:17.529
Well...

28:17.531 --> 28:18.797
you can't be gay, Cuban,

28:18.799 --> 28:21.133
and the leader
of the free world.

28:21.135 --> 28:23.168
No. You cannot.

28:31.412 --> 28:33.846
Aaand we're back.

28:37.217 --> 28:39.351
Jenn? What's up?

28:39.353 --> 28:43.822
Please, Ann...
I really need your help.

28:43.824 --> 28:45.958
Yeah, okay. Okay.

28:50.164 --> 28:51.196
I gotta go.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.901
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

29:03.177 --> 29:05.844
Geez. I left the beach for this?

29:07.181 --> 29:09.181
Ann!

29:10.717 --> 29:13.251
You look so beautiful!

29:13.253 --> 29:14.252
Do a twirl.

29:14.254 --> 29:15.454
Yeah!

29:15.456 --> 29:18.056
My God.
I've never seen your hair down.

29:18.058 --> 29:19.191
So beautiful.

29:19.193 --> 29:20.392
What happened?

29:20.394 --> 29:22.995
So, your friend here got caught
chugging box wine.

29:22.997 --> 29:24.929
Claims she forgot her wallet.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.465
Which means
I also can't get a gun.

29:26.467 --> 29:28.333
You know I wanted
to go to the range,

29:28.335 --> 29:30.535
just blow off some steam,
but then that plan went to shit

29:30.537 --> 29:32.537
when the wine
incident occurred...

29:32.539 --> 29:34.339
Okay. Shh... With Jeff.

29:34.341 --> 29:36.408
Looks like I'm gonna
have to use my tits on old...

29:36.410 --> 29:40.078
Jeff, my friend here,
she's having a real hard time.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.480
Do you think that...
Too straight.

29:41.482 --> 29:42.947
Shush.

29:42.949 --> 29:46.551
Do you think that maybe you can
cut her some slack if...

29:46.553 --> 29:48.220
If I pay for the wine

29:48.222 --> 29:51.223
and promise not to let her
purchase a firearm?

29:51.225 --> 29:52.557
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

29:52.559 --> 29:55.093
Look... let it slide
this time, right?

29:55.095 --> 29:56.695
Predictable, but effective.

29:56.697 --> 29:58.763
That's great. Thank you so much.
All right.

29:58.765 --> 30:02.034
Here... this should
cover the Merlot.

30:04.171 --> 30:04.969
Let's go.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.506
Yeah!

30:07.508 --> 30:08.773
All right, come on.

30:08.775 --> 30:09.974
Jeff.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.443
See ya in hell, Jeff!

30:13.780 --> 30:15.180
Look. I'm asleep...

30:15.182 --> 30:16.248
I'm awake...

30:16.250 --> 30:17.716
I'm asleep. I'm awake...

30:17.718 --> 30:18.917
What... What is that?

30:18.919 --> 30:20.052
What? What?

30:21.388 --> 30:23.455
No!

30:23.457 --> 30:24.857
- Jeff!
- Sorry.

30:24.859 --> 30:25.924
You need real help.

30:25.926 --> 30:27.125
Are you serious?

30:27.127 --> 30:28.527
I'm... Sorry.
It was just an oversight.

30:28.529 --> 30:29.728
Come on. Let's go.

30:29.730 --> 30:31.329
This day's starting out great.

30:32.533 --> 30:34.332
Look! It just got better!

30:34.334 --> 30:37.001
We have got to get you
to a meeting.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.470
Okay. Will you hold my hair?

30:38.472 --> 30:39.905
Yes. I got it.

30:45.579 --> 30:48.046
And, as always,
no cross talk, please.

30:48.048 --> 30:49.248
Jenn?

30:54.721 --> 30:57.055
These AA meetings
are so damn boring.

30:57.057 --> 31:00.392
I wish they could be
just a little entertaining.

31:04.999 --> 31:07.265
Hey. I'm Jenn.

31:08.803 --> 31:11.336
I'm an alcoholic.
I play the guitar sometimes.

31:11.338 --> 31:13.071
Hi, Jenn.

32:51.371 --> 32:52.905
You're guilty, too.

33:56.503 --> 33:58.270
Did that really happen?

34:01.375 --> 34:03.241
Don't do it. Don't do I...

34:03.243 --> 34:04.543
She's doing it.

34:09.650 --> 34:10.783
Babe.

34:10.784 --> 34:12.184
I... I'm here.

34:12.186 --> 34:14.186
I-It's over already?

34:15.255 --> 34:17.389
Bryce...

34:17.391 --> 34:19.190
that was us in there.

34:19.193 --> 34:20.659
Did you feel that?

34:23.730 --> 34:26.531
Man! It's stuck in my head.

34:26.533 --> 34:28.132
I'm gonna...

34:28.134 --> 34:30.569
I'm gonna see a lawyer
about drawing up papers.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.005
A divorce?
You think we're at divorce?

34:34.007 --> 34:36.074
100%.

34:36.076 --> 34:38.476
I see you with him
every time I close my eyes.

34:38.478 --> 34:39.944
What do you think I see?

34:39.946 --> 34:42.014
Yeah, she sees you and her mama
gettin' nasty!

34:42.016 --> 34:43.547
He knows, dumdum.

34:43.550 --> 34:45.818
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

34:45.820 --> 34:47.820
Yeah, we got some plannin' to do

34:47.822 --> 34:50.155
before shit pops off
at Zlata's golf game next week.

34:50.157 --> 34:52.891
All right, all right. Hey, D,
keep that shit to yourself.

34:52.893 --> 34:54.693
What are y'all
cookin' up, Roller?

34:54.695 --> 34:57.429
We're increasing our ranks
with some unlikely soldiers.

34:57.431 --> 34:58.497
Come on, boy. Come on, now.

34:58.499 --> 34:59.964
Let's go. That's enough.
Come on.

35:03.370 --> 35:04.436
You gonna tell Zlata?

35:04.438 --> 35:05.770
I'm not sure.

35:05.772 --> 35:08.374
Girl, she is
every shade of psycho!

35:09.309 --> 35:10.843
She also trained me

35:10.845 --> 35:13.311
and taught me
what being a boss really is.

35:13.313 --> 35:16.849
And all of our pockets are fat
right now 'cause of her.

35:16.851 --> 35:17.916
Not them.

35:17.918 --> 35:20.252
She has a point.

35:23.790 --> 35:24.656
Come here.

35:24.658 --> 35:26.525
I am so sorry
I missed your meeting.

35:26.527 --> 35:27.792
It's okay, babe.

35:27.794 --> 35:28.660
You okay?

35:28.662 --> 35:30.395
Nah, but what you gonna do?

35:31.998 --> 35:35.333
Y'all, them doughnuts at AA
were everything.

35:35.335 --> 35:36.869
This skinny bitch.

35:40.340 --> 35:42.006
Hey, honey. Is everything okay?

35:42.008 --> 35:43.408
Why aren't you in school?

35:43.410 --> 35:45.277
They had a problem
with my clothes.

35:45.279 --> 35:47.612
Did you wear
your "Trump has 99 Problems",

35:47.614 --> 35:49.614
and this bitch is one"
T-shirt again?

35:49.616 --> 35:51.349
I would've been a good mom.

35:51.351 --> 35:52.951
No, I had on this.

35:54.020 --> 35:55.320
Sweetie.

35:56.891 --> 35:59.558
You are a 17-year-old white girl

35:59.560 --> 36:02.361
who's suddenly all about
the Nation of Islam.

36:02.363 --> 36:03.896
What are you doin'?

36:03.898 --> 36:05.364
I'm finding my place.

36:05.366 --> 36:07.499
Your place is with me.

36:07.501 --> 36:10.769
You're not my mom.
I can make my own decisions.

36:10.771 --> 36:12.170
Sweetie, I know that.

36:12.172 --> 36:14.639
Relationships can't be forced,
Polly Pol.

36:14.641 --> 36:17.041
Arlene and I... that was real.

36:17.043 --> 36:18.843
This was always
a temporary thing.

36:18.845 --> 36:20.979
One of these days,
I'm gonna leave.

36:20.981 --> 36:22.447
No, no, no.

36:22.449 --> 36:26.251
No, I'm never gonna let you go,
Lillian. I promise. Okay?

36:26.253 --> 36:28.052
Lillian?

36:35.061 --> 36:37.195
I mean Marnie.

36:37.197 --> 36:38.997
I'll see you at the house.

36:43.738 --> 36:44.669
Pol.

36:44.671 --> 36:47.071
Teenagers.

36:47.073 --> 36:48.574
Okay.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.213
Okay.

36:55.215 --> 36:57.149
All right, y'all. So...

36:57.151 --> 36:59.083
What do I do? I'm torn.

36:59.085 --> 37:02.287
Do I tell Zlata
what Uncle Daddy is planning?

37:02.289 --> 37:04.022
Or do I keep it a secret?

37:04.024 --> 37:05.690
See, that's a tough one.

37:05.692 --> 37:07.292
'Cause it's kinda like,

37:07.294 --> 37:11.964
do I follow someone on Instagram
just because they follow me?

37:11.966 --> 37:13.832
Or do I, you know,

37:13.834 --> 37:16.168
just like some of their posts
and keep it cute?

37:16.170 --> 37:17.436
Is she for real?

37:17.438 --> 37:19.704
Sometimes I can't tell.

37:19.706 --> 37:21.974
Well, what does your gut say?

37:21.976 --> 37:23.976
Be loyal.?

37:23.978 --> 37:26.178
But to who?

37:26.180 --> 37:27.579
Ann, what you think?

37:27.581 --> 37:29.914
You're gonna ask me
about loyalty?

37:29.916 --> 37:33.585
I think you got a lot of nerve
asking me about loyalty.

37:33.587 --> 37:35.688
What is your problem?

37:37.123 --> 37:41.059
My problem is, I sold out
the love of my life for you.

37:41.061 --> 37:42.394
That's my problem.

37:42.396 --> 37:44.797
What is she talking about?
What are you talking about?

37:44.799 --> 37:46.465
You heard me, bitch.

37:46.467 --> 37:47.732
Ooh!

37:47.734 --> 37:49.401
- Call me that again.
- Hey.

37:50.537 --> 37:51.736
- Bitch.
- Hey, hey!

37:51.738 --> 37:53.672
Really? Hey!

37:56.210 --> 37:57.876
- Get off of me!
- Des!

37:57.878 --> 37:59.611
What is your damn problem?!

37:59.613 --> 38:02.080
Your life has become
about two things...

38:02.082 --> 38:04.883
Business with Zlata
and marrying Ruval.

38:04.885 --> 38:07.752
And because of that, you've lost
sight of all your friends!

38:07.754 --> 38:10.755
I have done
more than my fair share

38:10.757 --> 38:12.691
for your ass, Ann,
and you know it!

38:12.693 --> 38:14.426
You gon' sit up here
and lie like that?!

38:14.428 --> 38:15.828
You think I'm lying?

38:15.830 --> 38:17.762
You're asking for loyalty?

38:17.764 --> 38:19.364
And what do we get?

38:19.366 --> 38:22.434
I ruined my life for you!

38:22.436 --> 38:23.702
Bitch, how?!

38:23.704 --> 38:25.437
We were gonna have a child!

38:33.380 --> 38:34.947
- I got this.
- My God.

38:39.119 --> 38:40.853
Okay.

38:40.855 --> 38:43.321
Okay, I think I know
what's going on here.

38:43.323 --> 38:46.258
When I was dating Teller...
You know, the silent one...

38:46.260 --> 38:48.660
My God! Polly!

38:48.662 --> 38:51.230
I am so sick of your stories.

38:52.399 --> 38:53.932
I happen to have Teller
on speed-dial.

38:53.934 --> 38:56.000
Nobody believes your bullshit,
Polly, okay?

38:56.002 --> 38:59.003
You would realize that if
you weren't playing a character

38:59.005 --> 39:00.305
half of your stupid life.

39:02.409 --> 39:03.942
Okay. That may be.

39:03.944 --> 39:05.343
But here's the thing...

39:05.345 --> 39:07.345
You're not so different from me.

39:07.347 --> 39:08.613
I am nothing like you.

39:08.615 --> 39:11.684
You... You present a character
to all of us!

39:11.686 --> 39:14.553
The real you is obviously
inside your head,

39:14.555 --> 39:15.921
judging the rest of us.

39:17.558 --> 39:19.157
So stop blaming all of us...

39:19.159 --> 39:21.894
Hey! Hey! Stop telling
me how to live my life

39:21.896 --> 39:24.028
when you don't even know
who the hell you are, okay?

39:24.030 --> 39:27.232
And you?! You haven't even
been there for Jennifer.

39:27.234 --> 39:31.035
And you haven't even noticed
how unhappy I've been!

39:31.037 --> 39:34.239
You've been so caught up
with Zlata and Ruval

39:34.241 --> 39:36.508
and having it all, right?

39:36.510 --> 39:37.776
What do I have?

39:37.778 --> 39:39.043
What do I have?

39:39.045 --> 39:40.312
You have us, Ann.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.919
I got a call from DCF.

39:46.921 --> 39:50.255
They had a baby available
for me and Arlene.

39:50.257 --> 39:55.059
Yesterday would've been the day
we would've been a family.

39:55.061 --> 39:58.397
But because of you,
it was all ruined.

39:58.399 --> 39:59.932
All of it.

40:01.401 --> 40:03.335
You were adopting?

40:07.674 --> 40:13.245
I told you I had to give up
my baby when I was a kid.

40:15.482 --> 40:18.951
A little family...
That's all I ever wanted.

40:18.953 --> 40:20.853
Just, like, you know...

40:22.022 --> 40:24.390
But you made me
break up with Arlene.

40:26.093 --> 40:27.626
I destroyed her life.

40:27.628 --> 40:28.893
No, that's my fault.

40:28.895 --> 40:31.696
I'm the one
who made you set Arlene up.

40:31.698 --> 40:32.831
That wasn't Desna.

40:32.833 --> 40:35.367
I... I didn't want us
to go to jail!

40:35.369 --> 40:39.904
But... But she lost her job
because of me.

40:39.906 --> 40:41.506
I'm sorry.

40:45.445 --> 40:47.646
My God.

40:50.050 --> 40:52.050
I'm... I'm sorry.

40:52.052 --> 40:54.987
I'm... I'm sorry
that I slapped you. I'm sorry.

40:54.989 --> 40:59.257
I'm sorry I didn't know how much
Arlene meant to you, Ann.

40:59.994 --> 41:03.762
She meant everything, and I...
I chose you over her.

41:04.865 --> 41:08.400
I am so, so sorry, Ann.

41:08.402 --> 41:12.738
You gotta know that I would die
before knowingly hurting you.

41:14.475 --> 41:16.408
I love you, Ann. And I'm sorry.

41:16.410 --> 41:18.076
You... you...

41:18.078 --> 41:21.546
You got to talk to me, Ann.
I mean, I'm not a mind-reader.

41:21.548 --> 41:22.815
Arlene's not a cop anymore.

41:22.817 --> 41:24.416
Maybe y'all
could patch things up.

41:24.418 --> 41:25.750
Yeah!

41:25.752 --> 41:28.687
It's too late. She moved on.
So it's fine.

41:28.689 --> 41:32.624
Hey! I have never known
that kind of attitude from you.

41:33.828 --> 41:35.027
Man up, Ann.

41:35.029 --> 41:38.096
Go get your girl.

41:38.098 --> 41:38.963
Right?

41:38.965 --> 41:40.365
- Yeah. Go get her.
- Come on.

41:54.248 --> 41:55.380
Arlene?

41:55.382 --> 41:56.915
It's me... Ann.

41:56.917 --> 41:58.784
Are you home?

42:21.075 --> 42:23.742
Come on, mamita. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up, please.

42:23.744 --> 42:25.544
This is Arlene. Leave a message.

42:25.546 --> 42:26.979
Okay.

42:28.883 --> 42:30.683
I'm so sorry.

42:34.421 --> 42:36.288
I set you up.

42:36.290 --> 42:40.292
I drugged your drink
so they could pull you over

42:40.294 --> 42:42.094
and lose your job.

42:44.164 --> 42:47.099
I did it to...

42:47.101 --> 42:49.434
to protect Desna.

42:49.436 --> 42:53.305
I'm so, so sorry.

42:53.307 --> 42:55.107
I hope you can forgive me.

42:57.578 --> 43:00.044
I'll do whatever it takes.

43:00.046 --> 43:02.047
I love you, Arlene.

43:03.717 --> 43:05.684
And I want you back.

43:07.788 --> 43:09.654
I know that you're
seeing somebody, okay?

43:09.656 --> 43:10.989
I know that you are,

43:10.991 --> 43:14.126
but I really want you
to be with me.

43:14.128 --> 43:16.261
You belong with me.

43:16.263 --> 43:17.930
I miss you.

43:21.401 --> 43:23.135
I think we can do this.

43:25.071 --> 43:28.340
I think we can be that family.

43:47.894 --> 43:49.361
Hello?

43:49.363 --> 43:51.830
I got the call, too.

43:51.832 --> 43:53.498
About the baby.

43:53.500 --> 43:56.701
W-We forgot to...

43:56.703 --> 43:59.938
call DCF and cancel
the foster adoption.

44:01.241 --> 44:02.941
I'm not seeing anyone.

44:04.178 --> 44:06.311
Wha...

44:06.313 --> 44:07.512
Are you serious?

44:07.514 --> 44:09.514
She's just a friend.

44:09.516 --> 44:10.949
Seriously?

44:12.119 --> 44:13.585
Please.

44:14.921 --> 44:16.989
Please, give me another chance.

44:23.930 --> 44:26.598
Meet me at my place.
I'll be home soon.

44:28.669 --> 44:30.268
You okay?

44:30.270 --> 44:31.536
All good.

44:45.352 --> 44:47.686
Kenneth Brickman?

44:47.688 --> 44:48.821
You're under arrest. What?

44:48.823 --> 44:51.023
You have the right to
remain silent. Why?

44:51.025 --> 44:52.290
Anything you say can and will
be held against you.

44:52.292 --> 44:53.892
Why am I under arrest?
In a court of law.

44:53.894 --> 44:56.161
This is gonna be fun!

44:56.163 --> 44:58.630
What the hell is going on?
Why am I under arrest?

44:58.632 --> 45:00.098
God damn it!

45:00.100 --> 45:02.367
We ask the questions, okay?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

45:02.369 --> 45:03.502
What's going on?!

45:03.504 --> 45:04.504
Pipe down!
