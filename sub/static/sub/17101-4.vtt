01:36.997 --> 01:39.433
( dogs barking )

02:32.420 --> 02:36.624
( wind whistling )

02:48.068 --> 02:49.770
GOT YOUR BATH.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.807
I WASHED YOUR CLOTHES
AND CLEANED YOUR BEDPAN.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.081
IT'S NOT UGLY.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.883
YOU SAY THAT
EVERY TIME.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.453
IT'S NOT PATHETIC.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.655
AND IT'S NOT
A LIE, EITHER.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.890
I'M JUST HAVING
A LITTLE FUN, THAT'S ALL.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.759
I NEVER LET IT
GO TOO FAR.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.828
IT DOESN'T
HURT ANYBODY.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.867
LEAST OF ALL ME.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.069
I'LL BE BACK

03:22.169 --> 03:24.972
MOTHER,
OPEN THE DOOR.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.141

TALKING ABOUT--

03:28.242 --> 03:30.811
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

03:45.959 --> 03:50.698
( record playing )

03:50.798 --> 03:54.635
( male singing )

04:02.843 --> 04:04.878
HANDSOME DEVIL.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.925
( chattering )

04:45.152 --> 04:46.720
THERE'S TREES
OVER YONDER.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.456
WHY AREN'T THEY SET UP
NEXT TO THE TREES ?

04:48.556 --> 04:50.023
LEASTWAYS
WE GET SOME SHADE.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.925
I THOUGHT REPTILES
LIKED THE SUN.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.194
LAUGH-AND-A-HALF, THIS ONE,
OUGHTTA BE IN SHOW-BIZ !

04:54.294 --> 04:56.597
( laughing )

04:59.500 --> 05:03.737
Y'ALL KNOW WHERE
THAT ROAD LEADS TO ?

05:05.939 --> 05:08.342
BABYLON.

05:11.712 --> 05:15.549
I HEAR'D THEY STRUNG UP
THREE ROUSTIES IN BABYLON

05:15.649 --> 05:19.119
BACK IN '32, JUST
TO WATCH 'EM DANGLE.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.253
OH, HORSE-PUCKY.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.822
BABYLON DON'T
EVEN EXIST.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.992
IT'S JUST A TALE CARNIES
TELL AROUND A BOTTLE.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.293
IT WAS FOUR.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.895
AND IT WASN'T ROUSTIES
IT WAS FREAKS.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.998
THREE PINHEADS AND AN ALBINO
NAMED FREDDIE NEFF.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.933
OH, I HATE ALBINOS.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.802
( laughing )

05:34.902 --> 05:38.472
MAYBE SAMSON'LL TALK
SOME SENSE TO THE BOSS.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.740
MAYBE JONESY...

05:39.840 --> 05:40.908

SERIOUS TO ME.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.351
I'M TELLIN' YA.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.020
I GOT TO TALKIN'
WITH THE MEN,

05:53.120 --> 05:54.488
AND THEY WERE TELLING ME THINGS
THAT THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.724
OSGOOD,
RUN GET THE SEDAN.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.326
IT AIN'T JUST BELLY-ACHIN,
I GOT MEN READY TO BOLT.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.529
I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.497
THEY BEEN HINKY SINCE
WE LEFT THE CIRCUIT.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.533
NOW YOU GOT US SETTIN' UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.200
IT JUST DON'T MAKE
SENSE TO ME IS ALL.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.436
LOOK, IT AIN'T MY CALL.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.837
WELL, THEN TALK TO HIM,
TELL HIM !

06:09.937 --> 06:12.005
YOU KNOW THAT AIN'T GONNA
DO A DAMN BIT OF GOOD.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.741
WELL, THEN I--

06:13.841 --> 06:17.411
MAYBE I COULD
TAKE A CRACK AT IT.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.146
YOU KNOW...

06:19.246 --> 06:23.116
I COULD MAYBE
TALK TO HIM.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.654
THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.374
I EXPECT TO HAVE
EVERYTHING UP AND RUNNIN'

06:47.475 --> 06:49.610
BY THE TIME

06:50.878 --> 06:52.613

06:54.548 --> 06:57.017

JONESY.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.119
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU SHUT
YOUR HOLE AND GET BACK TO WORK.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.988

THE LOT OF YA.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.557

07:38.526 --> 07:40.360
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ?

07:40.460 --> 07:43.263
ROLLING UP BOTTLES
AND PUTTING THEM IN DRAWERS.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.634
HAND ME
THE LAST ONE.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.041
YOU WANTED

07:57.377 --> 07:59.179

SO, THEN...

08:14.227 --> 08:16.564
SHOW IT

08:16.664 --> 08:18.566
IT ISN'T
IN MY POSSESSION.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.101
YOU'LL HAVE
TO DRIVE US THERE.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.469
WHERE ?

08:22.570 --> 08:24.605
NOT FAR.

08:24.705 --> 08:29.943

SOME KINDA MONKEY SHINE.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.615

SO SAYS OUR BLESSED LORD *

* MUST BE,
OBEDIENT TO HIS WORD... *

09:30.037 --> 09:31.438
LOVELY.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.674
NORMAN, WHAT'RE YOU
DOING HERE ?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.743
I WISH YOU WOULD'VE
CALLED AHEAD.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.845
I WOULD HAVE HAD IRIS
MAKE YOU SOMETHING.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.647
COME ON, I WANT
TO SHOW YOU AROUND.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.414
THE CHILDREN'S DORMITORIES
ARE UPSTAIRS...

09:41.514 --> 09:43.050
THIS IS NOT
A SOCIAL VISIT, JUSTIN.

09:43.150 --> 09:48.221
McNAUGHTON RECEIVED
THIS LETTER TODAY.

09:55.763 --> 09:58.331
THEY SENT THIS
TO THE BISHOP ?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.834
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
YOUR CHURCH BOARD
WHAT YOU WERE DOING ?

10:00.934 --> 10:03.136
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL SOMEONE
WHAT YOU WERE DOING ?

10:03.236 --> 10:05.605
I DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL
WITH THEIR RED TAPE.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.475
JUSTIN, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU--

10:08.575 --> 10:11.311
I DIDN'T SPEND ONE PENNY
OF THE BOARD'S MONEY.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.246
NOT ONE CENT
OF THEIR FUNDS.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.515
YOU ARE A CHURCH ASSET.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.484
THEY PAY YOU
FOR YOUR TIME.

10:17.584 --> 10:20.120
THAT TIME SHOULD BE
SPENT WITH THEM.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.588
NOT OVER HERE.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.824
BUT I HAVEN'T NEGLECTED
THAT CONGREGATION.

10:23.924 --> 10:28.228
YOUR BOARD AND 72 OF
YOUR MEMBERS THINK OTHERWISE.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.131
WHAT IF THE BISHOP
WERE TO COME HERE HIMSELF.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.600
WHAT IF HE WERE TO SEE
THE GOOD WORK THAT--

10:33.701 --> 10:35.703
THE DECISION
HAS BEEN MADE.

10:35.803 --> 10:41.508
NOW EITHER YOU TURN THIS
CHAPEL OVER TO SOMEONE ELSE

10:41.608 --> 10:44.812
AND RETURN TO YOUR DUTIES
AT FIRST METHODIST,

10:44.912 --> 10:47.580
OR YOU'LL BE DISCIPLINED
AND REASSIGNED.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.582
I CAN'T JUST STOP.

10:49.683 --> 10:52.485
THEY'LL BE SOME TIME
FOR TRANSITION.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.822
NO, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

10:54.922 --> 10:58.391
GOD TOLD ME
TO DO THIS.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.427
HE SPOKE TO ME.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.529
AS HE SPEAKS
TO ALL OF US.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.897
NO.

11:03.997 --> 11:08.401
AS HE SPOKE TO ABRAHAM
AND ISIAH AND MOSES.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.642
THANK YOU FOR
COMING, NORMAN.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.878

11:54.748 --> 11:59.753

14:25.332 --> 14:28.936
I'M WAITING
FOR MY BROTHER, BEN.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.004
HE WENT TO SEND A WIRE
AND RUN SOME ERRANDS...

14:31.104 --> 14:33.773
HE SHOULD BE

14:33.873 --> 14:35.775
WHY DON'T YOU

14:35.875 --> 14:37.444
IT'S COOLER.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.451
HOW MUCH FURTHER ?

15:18.551 --> 15:20.087
PATIENCE, BOY.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.822

15:22.922 --> 15:24.691
UNIQUE ?

15:24.791 --> 15:26.293
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN ?

15:26.393 --> 15:29.029
BY TELLING YOU EVERYTHING NOW,
IT WOULD SPOIL THE ADVENTURE.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.131
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.835
I'M CALLIN' YOU.

( coughing )

21:00.627 --> 21:02.329
HAWKINS...

21:12.672 --> 21:14.841
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOIN' ?

21:14.941 --> 21:17.444
WELCOME.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.349
SO, YOU MARRIED ?

21:22.449 --> 21:26.786
NO, NO, NEVER FOUND
THE RIGHT GIRL.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.055
WHO'S SALLY ?

21:29.155 --> 21:31.123
SALLY ?

21:31.223 --> 21:32.625
"SALLY'S CAFE."

21:32.725 --> 21:35.995
YEAH, RIGHT,
THAT'S MY MA.

21:36.095 --> 21:39.599
SHE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO COOK.

21:43.670 --> 21:47.774
WELL, THAT WAS BOUND
TO HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER.

22:08.327 --> 22:12.432
( thunder )

22:26.178 --> 22:28.981
I'VE GOT TWO BUCKS.

22:29.081 --> 22:32.118
TWO BUCKS ?

22:34.887 --> 22:36.756
ALRIGHT.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.608
( door shutting )

23:12.892 --> 23:15.595
YOU BROUGHT ME
OUT HERE FOR WHAT ?

23:15.695 --> 23:17.396
HUH ?!

23:17.497 --> 23:18.731
NOTHIN' !

23:18.831 --> 23:20.633
I ALMOST GOT
DEAD OUT THERE !

23:20.733 --> 23:23.703
YOU WERE NOT
IN ANY REAL DANGER.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.839
I THINK WE BOTH
KNOW THAT.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.841
I DAMN NEAR DIED.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.477
HOW MELODRAMATIC.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.245
BORN FOR THE STAGE,
YOUNG HAWKINS.

23:33.345 --> 23:40.319
THIS STORM, IT'S WHAT THEY
CALL A "BLACK BLIZZARD", NO ?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.288
IT'S THE NAME
THEY GAVE TO IT.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.924
THE TOPSOIL
OF 10,000 FARMS.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.460
MUCH LIKE YOUR OWN.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.262
KILLS DREAMS.

23:50.362 --> 23:53.900
LEND ME YOUR HAND, BOY.

23:58.471 --> 24:00.873
IT KILLED
YOUR MOTHER.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.141
WHAT'S IT TO YOU ?

24:02.241 --> 24:05.044
SHE DROWNED IN IT...

24:05.144 --> 24:07.113
THE DUST.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.848
YOU SHUT THE HELL UP.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.416
ALONE !

24:10.517 --> 24:13.252
YOU SHUT IT,
OR I SWEAR TO CHRIST,

24:13.352 --> 24:14.654
I'LL SHUT IT FOR YOU.

24:14.754 --> 24:18.457
OF COURSE,
YOU SURVIVED IT.

24:18.558 --> 24:21.427
HEY, STOP IT, NOW !

24:21.528 --> 24:24.330
( wind howling )

24:24.430 --> 24:26.966
THAT CEASELESS
HOWLING.

24:27.066 --> 24:31.103
THE HIGH PITCHED
SHRIEK OF THE WIND.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.439
LISTEN.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.509
THE SOUND
OF HER DEATH.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.210
MAKE IT STOP !

24:38.310 --> 24:42.982
STOP IT NOW !

24:43.082 --> 24:45.952
( abrupt silence )

24:48.254 --> 24:51.057
OPEN THE DOOR.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.782
YOU DID THAT.

25:18.785 --> 25:21.020
NO.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.056
NO !

25:30.730 --> 25:33.532
YOU DID THAT TOO.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.835
YOU'RE CRAZY.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.303
QUITE.

25:37.403 --> 25:39.371
BUT IT WAS YOU
WHO STOPPED THE STORM.

25:39.471 --> 25:40.607
IT HAD NOTHIN'
TO DO WITH ME.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.710
IT HAD EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.779
ONLY GOD CAN MAKE
THE WEATHER STOP !

25:46.879 --> 25:49.916
THINK YOU CAN HIDE
WHAT YOU ARE...

25:50.016 --> 25:52.251
YOU CAN'T.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.520
NOT EVEN
FROM YOURSELF.

25:54.621 --> 25:58.524
A BLIND MAN
CAN SEE THAT.

25:58.625 --> 26:02.662
DON'T BE A FOOL.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.832
LET ME HELP YOU.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.700
I DON'T WANT
YOUR GODDAMN HELP !

26:07.800 --> 26:11.070
YOU'RE A TWO-BIT,
USED UP OLD JUNKIE !

26:13.539 --> 26:16.976
YOU BURNED ME !

26:18.978 --> 26:21.914
BUT YOU'RE NOT
BURNED, ARE YOU ?

26:22.014 --> 26:28.287
YET THE SMELL OF BURNING FLESH
LINGERS ON IN THE AIR.

26:44.403 --> 26:47.206
WHAT, WHAT IS IT ?

26:57.950 --> 27:01.220
WE NEED TO SPEAK
TO NORMAN.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.289
NORMAN WAS
THE MESSENGER.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.757
WHAT DID HE SAY ?

27:04.857 --> 27:11.030
HE SAID THAT I SHOULD
OBEY THE BISHOP.

27:12.164 --> 27:15.134
NORMAN'S ALWAYS DONE
WHAT'S BEST FOR US.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.402
YES, I KNOW.

27:16.502 --> 27:18.304
HE SAVED US.

27:18.404 --> 27:19.505
MORE THAN ONCE.

27:19.605 --> 27:21.073
I WON'T IGNORE
THE WILL OF GOD !

27:21.173 --> 27:24.510
BUT MAYBE IT'S GOD
SPEAKING TO YOU, TOO.

27:24.610 --> 27:27.747
FIRST METHODIST
IS YOUR ROCK.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.549
WAIT, BE PATIENT.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.084
YOUR TIME
WILL COME.

27:32.184 --> 27:35.087
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS
A BOY HERE WHOSE MOTHER

27:35.187 --> 27:37.556
ABANDONED HIM IN THE RESTROOM
OF A FIVE-AND-DIME ?

27:37.656 --> 27:39.291
NO, BUT--

27:39.391 --> 27:43.029
OR THAT POLLY ANN'S FATHER SOLD
HER TO SOME MEN FOR ONE DOLLAR.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.365
NO.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.634
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.970
WHO WANTS TO DWELL
ON THINGS LIKE THAT ?

27:51.070 --> 27:54.606
WE NEVER CONSIDER
THE LITTLE ONES.

27:54.707 --> 27:57.609
WE ONLY PUT ON
OUR CLOTHES.

27:57.710 --> 28:00.847
WHO CAN SEE THE CHILDREN,
FEEDING THE ENDLESS,

28:00.947 --> 28:03.682
RAVENOUS HUNGER
OF THE TEXTILE MILL.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.819
MECHANICAL MOUTHS
THAT AREN'T CHOOSY.

28:06.919 --> 28:10.422
A SILKEN THREAD,
A LOCK OF HAIR,

28:10.522 --> 28:12.424
A SCRAP OF SCALP,

28:12.524 --> 28:14.894
TINY, TORN FINGERS...

28:14.994 --> 28:17.596
WE ONLY TURN
UP THE HEAT,

28:17.696 --> 28:18.865
WHY THINK OF THE BOYS
IN THE MINES,

28:18.965 --> 28:21.000
CROUCHED OVER
THE CHUTES.

28:21.100 --> 28:26.372
FOR HOURS THEY SIT, SIFTING
THE REFUSE FROM THE COAL.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.108
THEIR BACKS BENT.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.143
OLD MEN BY NINE.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.212
BLACK LUNG BY 12.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.948
COAL IS HEAVY
AND HARD.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.051
HANDS ARE SOFT
AND FRAGILE.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.620
CRUSHED.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.589
FEET CRUSHED.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.825
SKULLS CRUSHED.

28:45.925 --> 28:49.929
GO FOR A WALK,
YOU SEE THEM.

28:50.029 --> 28:53.699
BOYS AND GIRLS
SELLING THEMSELVES,

28:53.800 --> 28:55.734
TO MEN AND WOMEN.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.569
A NICKEL
BUYS A VIRGIN.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.839
SOME ARE KEPT
IN CAGES.

28:59.939 --> 29:03.709
BABIES BOUGHT BY MEN
WHO RAISE THEM AS LIVESTOCK,

29:03.810 --> 29:06.245
ANIMALS TO ABUSE,

29:06.345 --> 29:10.182
SOFT FLESH TO VIOLATE,
TO TEAR, AND BITE.

29:10.282 --> 29:14.486
IF ANYONE CAUSES EVEN
ONE OF THE LITTLE ONES

29:14.586 --> 29:16.122
WHO BELIEVE
IN ME TO SIN,

29:16.222 --> 29:18.858
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM
TO HAVE A LARGE MILLSTONE

29:18.958 --> 29:20.626
HUNG AROUND HIS NECK
AND BE DROWNED

29:20.726 --> 29:22.361
IN THE DEPTHS
OF THE SEA !

29:22.461 --> 29:24.163
THEY MUST
OPEN THEIR EYES,

29:24.263 --> 29:26.165
THEY MUST OPEN
THEIR MOUTHS AND DROWN !

29:26.265 --> 29:29.768
( wind roaring )

29:42.614 --> 29:45.151
( coughing )

29:46.485 --> 29:48.120
ANYONE SEEN SOFIE ?

29:48.220 --> 29:49.521
NO, NO !

29:49.621 --> 29:55.194
SO WHEN ARE WE GONNA
GET TO SHELTER ?

29:58.898 --> 30:01.433
WHEN MANAGEMENT
SAYS SO.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.136
JUST LIKE ALWAYS.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.946
( door opening )

30:17.516 --> 30:19.751
WHAT HAPPENED ?

30:19.852 --> 30:23.222
WIND.

30:32.198 --> 30:37.469
HOW MANY TRICKS
YOU TURN IN A DAY ?

30:41.140 --> 30:43.042
TRICKS ?

30:43.142 --> 30:45.111
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE
CALL 'EM AT THE CARNIVAL.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.079
HOW MANY ?

30:47.179 --> 30:48.948
WHY ?

30:49.048 --> 30:50.883
JUST CURIOUS.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.886
BUSINESSMAN
TO BUSINESSWOMAN.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.456
FIVE.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.992
THREE, MAYBE.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.661
HOW LONG IT TAKE YOU
TO DO EACH ONE,

31:02.761 --> 31:05.564
ASSUMING IT'S
STRAIGHT-UP FUCKIN' ?

31:05.664 --> 31:11.270
HALF-HOUR,
MAYBE LESS.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.040
SEEMED MORE LIKE
45 MINUTES, BY MY WATCH.

31:14.140 --> 31:17.776
YOU WAS TIMIN' US ?

31:17.876 --> 31:20.646
WELL, I ONLY HEARD
THE BEDSPRINGS CREAKIN'

31:20.746 --> 31:21.948
FOR THE FIRST
12 MINUTES.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.350
BUT I BET YOU CAN
TURN 'EM OUT FASTER.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.185
WAY FASTER !

31:26.285 --> 31:29.255
MIGHT CUT INTO
REPEAT BUSINESS.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.323
NAW HELL.

31:31.423 --> 31:34.026
WHAT'S A FELLA CARE HOW LONG IT
TAKES LONG AS HE GETS HIS NUT.

31:34.126 --> 31:37.196
BESIDES, YOU INCREASE
YOUR PROFIT.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.598
DOUBLE MAYBE, IF YOU CAN
GET IT DOWN TO SAY, UNDER,

31:39.698 --> 31:41.500
SIX MINUTES.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.336
WHY YOU CAN CHURN 'EM OUT IN
20 MINUTES FOR THE PILLOW-TALK.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.505
TELL YOU WHAT.

31:46.605 --> 31:51.077
LET'S SEE HOW FAST
YOU CAN DO OSGOOD HERE.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.048
NO.

31:56.148 --> 32:02.254
SAWBUCK
SAYS YOU WILL.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.994
I AIN'T,
I AIN'T READY.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.362
YOU'RE READY WHEN
I TELL YOU YOU READY.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.664
I SAID, NO.

32:16.468 --> 32:17.703
10.

32:17.803 --> 32:22.474
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS ?

32:30.282 --> 32:31.883
OKAY.

32:31.984 --> 32:35.521
I JUST, I DON'T THINK
I'M UP TO IT.

32:35.621 --> 32:36.788
COME ON !

32:36.888 --> 32:41.260
DON'T SELL
YOURSELF SHORT.

32:47.533 --> 32:50.536
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
KEEP YOUR MONEY.

32:50.636 --> 32:54.106
I LIKE THIS BOY.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.196
I DON'T WANT IT.

33:19.898 --> 33:23.302
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

33:25.304 --> 33:26.905
I DON'T HAVE
TO USE IT.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.507
DON'T BE ABSURD.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.376
IT'S A GIFT !

33:30.476 --> 33:35.514
I GAVE UP MY EYES FOR
A FRACTION OF WHAT YOU POSSESS.

33:37.983 --> 33:39.885
YOU MUST LET ME
HELP YOU, BOY.

33:39.985 --> 33:43.322
BABYLON WILL BE
UPON US SOON.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.463
I DON'T CARE.

33:51.563 --> 33:55.501
THE VERY LAND
THE TOWN STANDS ON...

33:55.601 --> 33:57.536
POISON !

33:57.636 --> 33:59.338
IT SWALLOWS MAN.

33:59.438 --> 34:03.742
IT WILL SWALLOW YOU TOO,
IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED.

34:03.842 --> 34:09.315
BUT I CAN TEACH YOU.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.719
HAWKINS ?

34:16.188 --> 34:19.191
HAWKINS, ANSWER ME !

34:19.291 --> 34:23.229
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

34:26.598 --> 34:30.236
( moaning )

34:59.765 --> 35:01.933
OH GOD.

35:02.033 --> 35:03.369
OH GOD...

35:03.469 --> 35:06.738
OH GOD...

35:27.726 --> 35:31.730
LOOKS LIKE THINGS ARE
CLEARING UP OUT THERE SOME.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.406
SMOKE ?

35:40.506 --> 35:41.640
SURE.

36:14.139 --> 36:18.210
IT'S OKAY.

36:18.310 --> 36:22.314
IT WAS THE STORM.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.824
FOR YOUR STATUE.

37:07.693 --> 37:10.462
YOU GONNA BE OUT
THIS WAY, AGAIN ?

37:10.562 --> 37:13.665
I SUSPECT SO,
SOONER OR LATER.

37:13.765 --> 37:19.571
WHEN YOU DO,
DON'T COME BACK HERE.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.115
SHE GONNA BE OKAY ?

37:30.215 --> 37:32.518
SHE'S LUCKY,
WE ALL ARE.

37:32.618 --> 37:37.723
BAD AS THIS THING IS,
COULD'VE BEEN WORSE.

37:37.823 --> 37:42.594
I HAD NO SAY IN IT.

37:45.397 --> 37:48.334
AIN'T BLAMIN' YA,
JONESY.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.602
IT'S MANAGEMENT'S CALL.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.671
SAMSON'S ONLY ONE
WHO CAN TALK TO HIM...

37:52.771 --> 37:55.341
HELL, EVERYBODY
KNOWS THAT.

38:06.485 --> 38:09.154
THAT GAL IS
A REAL WINGDINGER.

38:09.254 --> 38:13.692
SHUT UP, OSGOOD.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.948
EVERYTHING OKAY ?

38:44.590 --> 38:47.626
YOU ALRIGHT
IN THERE ?!

39:19.958 --> 39:24.095
SAMSON'S GONE, THOUGHT
I'D CHECK IN ON YA.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.603
HELLO ?

39:39.878 --> 39:41.913
IT'S ME, JONESY.

39:44.282 --> 39:47.453
CLAYTON JONES.

39:51.423 --> 39:53.792
YOU AWAKE ?

40:30.261 --> 40:32.030
SIR ?

40:50.148 --> 40:52.083
GODDAMN.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.489
GODDAMN.

41:07.398 --> 41:10.035
WELL ?

41:13.404 --> 41:16.141
DON'T YOU WISHED YOU
LEARNED MORE ?

41:32.090 --> 41:34.826
DID YOU GET WHAT'D YA
WANT FROM THE KID ?

41:34.926 --> 41:36.294
MORE.

41:36.394 --> 41:38.296
I KNEW HE'D BE
A RIPE SUCK.

41:38.396 --> 41:41.667
THERE IS MUCH
WORK TO BE DONE.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.146
I'M SORRY.

42:11.563 --> 42:13.632
YES, I DID.

42:15.801 --> 42:18.604
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
LATER, OKAY ?

42:21.873 --> 42:25.076
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS MARRIED.

42:33.785 --> 42:36.788
THAT'S AN UGLY LIE.

42:48.499 --> 42:50.568
HOW-DI-DO
THERE, JONESY.

42:50.669 --> 42:55.774
BLOWDOWN TO END
ALL BLOWDOWNS, EH ?

42:59.277 --> 43:01.780
EVERYTHING
HUNKY-DORY ?

43:05.116 --> 43:06.652
JUST FINE.

43:06.752 --> 43:08.987
RIGHT AS RAIN.
