<i>but the recent heat wave had</i>

00:29.059 --> 00:31.186
<i>It had also caused problems...</i>

<i>in his presentation to</i>
<i>the Bluth Company investors.</i>

00:34.097 --> 00:36.793
There's no screwups
with the permits this time?

00:36.900 --> 00:39.130
The permits have been filed
absolutely on time.

00:39.236 --> 00:41.067
- You have my word on that.
- <i>[Drip]</i>

00:43.440 --> 00:45.567

Well, as you can...
The important part is here.

00:51.114 --> 00:53.139
- Bye, you guys. Really great to see you again.
- Bye.

{ Beeps]

00:59.389 --> 01:02.688
- I think it's the sweating.
- I've gotta get a car.

01:02.792 --> 01:05.123
Don't worry.
I told them the truth.

01:05.227 --> 01:07.788
- That I rode here on a bike?
- That the permits weren't filed.

01:07.898 --> 01:11.698
But my dad filed the permits
before he went to jail.

01:11.801 --> 01:14.201
He most certainly did not.

01:14.304 --> 01:16.363
So, I just lied
to the investors?

01:16.473 --> 01:18.941
- You most certainly did.
- That's really great.

01:19.042 --> 01:22.034
Now I gotta ride my bike out to
the prison and talk to my dad about this.

01:22.145 --> 01:23.942
That'll be fun
in 100-degree heat.

01:24.047 --> 01:26.208
Why don't you take
your dad's car?

01:26.316 --> 01:30.150
No. Dad would never go for that.

01:30.253 --> 01:34.053
No, no, no, no.
There's no ice cream in the car.

01:34.157 --> 01:37.320
- I'll be careful.
- All right. This is what we're gonna do.

01:37.427 --> 01:39.452
Careful, Michael.

01:42.632 --> 01:45.123
Oh.

01:48.138 --> 01:50.038
- <i>Whatever you think.</i>
- Yeah.

01:50.140 --> 01:52.631
But I did see Gob
driving it last week.

01:52.742 --> 01:55.472
<i>Wait. Honestly,</i>
<i>Gob's driving the car?</i>

01:55.579 --> 01:58.207
I'm not the liar.

01:58.315 --> 02:01.045
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael needed his father's car...</i>

02:01.151 --> 02:03.449
<i>so he went to confront</i>
<i>his brother Gob.</i>

02:03.553 --> 02:06.181
- Give me a Gob.
- Gob!

02:06.289 --> 02:08.223
No, I didn't mean for you
to yell my name at me.

02:08.324 --> 02:10.225
It's what I call a double-dipped banana
with everything on it.

02:10.327 --> 02:13.524
<i>Hey, I can't believe you.</i>
<i>I asked you two weeks ago...</i>

02:13.630 --> 02:16.064
whether we should use Dad's car,
and you said it would be bad form.

02:16.166 --> 02:20.603
- Now I hear you're driving it.
- That is a lie, a bold-faced lie!

02:20.704 --> 02:23.867
<i>[Narrator] Gob was lying.</i>
<i>He had been driving his father's car.</i>

02:28.545 --> 02:31.343
<i>?? [Man Singing, Indistinct]</i>

02:38.221 --> 02:40.189
Why don't you just take
your precious, portable...

02:40.290 --> 02:43.191
stairway vehicle you're always trying
to convince us is a car?

02:43.293 --> 02:45.386
Yeah, that would be great,
except our brother-in-law...

02:45.495 --> 02:47.395
left it in
an airport parking lot.

02:47.497 --> 02:49.192
From whence it came, huh?

02:49.299 --> 02:52.530
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Tobias had intended</i>
<i>to park the family's only vehicle...</i>

02:52.636 --> 02:54.536
<i>at the airport parking lot...</i>

02:54.638 --> 02:57.732
<i>but was waved on</i>
<i>to the tarmac instead...</i>

02:57.841 --> 03:00.139
<i>where he found a spot</i>
<i>close to his gate.</i>

03:02.479 --> 03:04.970
Here you go, Uncle Gob.
I had to use two sticks...

03:05.081 --> 03:07.015
to support all
the extra chocolate and nuts.

03:07.117 --> 03:09.608
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa.
Two sticks and extra chocolate?

03:09.719 --> 03:11.812
Is it Mardi Gras?
What are you charging for that?

03:11.921 --> 03:14.549
- He doesn't like to discuss money.
- I don't like to discuss money.

03:14.658 --> 03:18.150
- You don't pay for it?
- A Bluth banana? No, I hadn't planned on it.

03:18.261 --> 03:20.126
But I'll tell you what...
if you want to use my likeness...

03:20.230 --> 03:22.130
for a Hamburglar-type character...

03:22.232 --> 03:24.792
I'll sign off on that,
Mr. Banana-Grabber.

03:24.901 --> 03:27.927
No, no, no, no, no. No more banana grabbing.
No more car grabbing.

03:28.038 --> 03:31.337
- Throw that away, please.
- But it's already made.

03:31.441 --> 03:33.671
I don't care.
Nobody gets it now, okay?

03:35.178 --> 03:39.615
- Are you happy?
- My own brother, Michael.

03:40.817 --> 03:43.183
My own selfish brother.

03:45.121 --> 03:47.021
- Michael.
- All right.

03:49.592 --> 03:52.789
I do not want you to get upset.
He did not mean that.

03:52.896 --> 03:55.763
- Sometimes he says...
- Selfish Michael.

04:00.537 --> 04:02.869
He did not mean that either.

04:02.972 --> 04:06.305
<i>[Narrator] Michael then went to his sister</i>
<i>to find his father's car.</i>

04:06.409 --> 04:08.138
What car? I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:08.244 --> 04:11.042
Dad's car. The one you
didn't tell me that you had...

04:11.147 --> 04:13.809
even though I had to ride
my bicycle to work all week.

04:13.917 --> 04:15.885
Oh, Dad's car.

04:15.985 --> 04:18.680
Well, obviously, I'm gonna use it
if it's an emergency.

04:18.788 --> 04:21.689
<i>[Narrator] Lindsay had such an emergency</i>
<i>three days earlier...</i>

04:21.791 --> 04:25.557
<i>when her salon was able to squeeze</i>
<i>her in at the last moment.</i>

{ Gasps]
That color's discontinued!

04:29.566 --> 04:32.034
I have to get ready
for the bachelorette auction.

04:32.135 --> 04:34.262
The bachelorette auction?
You know you're married.

04:34.370 --> 04:36.565
<i>You just go to dinner with the guy.</i>
<i>It's for charity.</i>

04:36.673 --> 04:39.801
That's what you said about posing
for the Ladies of Literacy Calendar.

04:39.909 --> 04:42.673
The one with the pictures of all
the 30-year-old women in lingerie...

04:42.779 --> 04:45.942
with their nipples covered
by copies of <i>Oliver Twist.</i>

04:46.049 --> 04:48.108
Yeah, that made a big difference
for the young ones.

04:48.218 --> 04:50.482
It would have if it didn't
get banned from the schools.

04:50.587 --> 04:53.078
Come on, face it. You do all this
charity crap just to stroke your ego.

04:53.189 --> 04:55.089
You don't even know
what the auction's for tonight.

04:55.191 --> 04:58.649
- The wetlands.
- To do what with them?

04:58.762 --> 05:01.162
- Dry them.
- Save them.

05:01.264 --> 05:03.698
From drying. Which is more
than you would ever do.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.995
You're, like, the least
charitable person I know.

05:07.103 --> 05:09.128
I don't do
anything for myself.

05:09.239 --> 05:11.207
Everything that I do
is for this family.

05:11.307 --> 05:13.207
<i>Oh, you don't do it</i>
<i>for us, Michael.</i>

05:13.309 --> 05:15.709
You just do it because you love
being the guy in charge.

05:15.812 --> 05:20.875
Cause you love saying no, like you said
to Gob when he wanted a frozen banana.

05:20.984 --> 05:24.351
And even after he gave you the rights
to his Mr. Banana-Grabber character.

05:24.454 --> 05:28.015
You know what? I will start doing my
charity work when you start doing yours.

05:28.124 --> 05:31.184
In the meantime, where's the car?

05:31.294 --> 05:33.694
I think Buster has it.
I don't know. It's on the schedule.

05:33.797 --> 05:37.028
There is a schedule?

05:37.133 --> 05:41.536
I always try so hard
not to look at this thing.

05:41.638 --> 05:43.873
- <i>[Narrator] So Michael went to find Buster.</i>
- Who let you in?

05:43.873 --> 05:44.771
- <i>[Narrator] So Michael went to find Buster.</i>
- Who let you in?

05:44.874 --> 05:47.399
<i>Your new cleaning woman.</i>
<i>What happened to Luz?</i>

05:47.510 --> 05:50.946
Supposedly, Luz had to take
her daughter to the hospital.

05:51.047 --> 05:52.947
That's Lupe, her sister.

05:53.049 --> 05:56.485
- God, I hope she's okay.
- She's awful. Can barely wash a dish.

05:56.586 --> 06:01.922
Uh-oh. She better not walk through here
after she's been in there.

06:02.025 --> 06:03.726
- Tell me you've got an exit strategy.
- <i>Mother.</i>

06:03.726 --> 06:05.421
- Tell me you've got an exit strategy.
- <i>Mother.</i>

06:05.528 --> 06:09.555
Oh, please. They didn't sneak
into this country to be your friends.

06:11.201 --> 06:12.930
Wow.

06:13.036 --> 06:15.630
Don't you judge me.
You're the selfish one.

06:15.738 --> 06:19.731
You're the one who charged his own
brother for a Bluth frozen banana.

06:19.843 --> 06:21.743
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>it's one banana, Michael.</i>

06:21.845 --> 06:23.904
<i>What could it cost, $ 10?</i>

06:24.013 --> 06:26.914
You've never actually set foot
in a supermarket, have you?

06:27.016 --> 06:28.643
I don't have time for this.

06:28.751 --> 06:30.742
I've got to get ready
for the bachelorette auction.

06:30.854 --> 06:33.652
You're doing that? You can't possibly
tell me that you care about the wetlands.

06:33.756 --> 06:37.954
I care about going for more money
than Lucille Austero.

06:38.061 --> 06:40.859
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Lucille Bluth</i>
<i>had made sure of that.</i>

06:40.964 --> 06:44.331
- Lucille!
- I got you tickets to <i>The Producers.</i>

06:44.434 --> 06:47.164
I already saw it
in New York.

06:47.270 --> 06:52.367
But that's of no use to a woman whose vertigo
makes flying a grotesque misadventure.

06:52.475 --> 06:56.434
You must have scrimped
and saved for these.

06:56.546 --> 06:59.276
But isn't this
the night of the auction?

06:59.382 --> 07:02.010
- Is it?
- You seem pretty confident.

07:02.118 --> 07:04.018
Oh, I think there's
a certain bachelor...

07:04.120 --> 07:06.782
who won't mind coming home
with me at the end of the evening.

07:06.890 --> 07:10.189
- Buster.
- Where did he go?

07:10.293 --> 07:12.784

<i>Why do you hide</i>
<i>every time the doorbell rings?</i>

07:15.632 --> 07:19.124
- I'm not hiding.
- <i>[Narrator] Buster was hiding</i>
<i>from Lucille Austero.</i>

<i>a social event while not wearing his glasses...</i>

How come you didn't tell me

Listen, about that permit thing,
that's an easy fix.

just break into the permit office, slip
the application into the next file...

- Michael, you lied to your investors.
