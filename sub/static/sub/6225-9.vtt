DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.256 --> 00:09.677
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.889
His name, Merlin.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.517
(THUNDERING)

(CHAINS RATTLING)

01:10.196 --> 01:11.447
MERLIN: Gaius!

01:11.864 --> 01:13.699
She's fallen prey to a bounty hunter.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.327
She's only a girl!

01:16.577 --> 01:18.329
She'll still fetch a good price, though.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.414
Someone's going to pay for her?

01:20.498 --> 01:23.167
Uther offers a big reward
for anyone with magic.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.545
There must be something we can do.

01:26.879 --> 01:27.922
Merlin.

01:28.005 --> 01:31.175
Bounty hunters are dangerous men,
they're not to be meddled with.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.511
You of all people
should understand that.

Here.

04:12.837 --> 04:13.921
(GASPS)

04:14.004 --> 04:15.297
Sorry!

04:16.173 --> 04:18.259
Sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.262
| just thought you might be cold.

04:23.514 --> 04:24.765
Why did you do that?

04:24.849 --> 04:26.183
-What?
-Help me.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.646
| saw you and...

04:35.067 --> 04:37.945
It could've been me in that cage.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.241
You'll be safe down here.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.410
I'll come back in the morning,

04:44.577 --> 04:46.245
with some food and candles.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.166
Will you be all right till then?

04:53.210 --> 04:54.920
I'm Merlin, by the way.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.299
I'm Freya.

Freya.

05:15.149 --> 05:18.444
I'll see you in the morning, Freya.

ARTHUR: Oi!

06:30.015 --> 06:32.351
Where's the meat, cheese...

06:32.434 --> 06:33.811
That's the new breakfast menu.

06:34.645 --> 06:35.813
This isn't enough.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.606
We've got to keep you in shape.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.567
I'm fighting fit.

06:39.650 --> 06:40.985
And we want to keep you that way.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.612
Merlin!

06:44.321 --> 06:45.698
Is there somewhere you have to be?

06:45.781 --> 06:46.865
Of course not.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.285
Good, because I've got
some chores for you to do.

06:50.119 --> 06:51.161
(SIGHS)

06:55.958 --> 06:57.376

07:04.216 --> 07:05.801
(CHANTING)

07:16.020 --> 07:17.229
Is it ready?

07:17.313 --> 07:18.606
Yeah, freshly heated.

(FIZZING)

07:20.649 --> 07:21.734
(SHOUTS)

You bumpkin! It's boiling.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.653
Boiling?

07:24.737 --> 07:25.904
You're half asleep today.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.073
I'm sorry, Sire. I'll get you some cold.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.034
No, I'll get you some.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.246
That woken you up?

07:35.039 --> 07:36.790
Raring to go, Sire.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.964
Ah, Halig,

07:44.048 --> 07:45.883
you come bearing gifts?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.384
Yes, Sire.

07:47.718 --> 07:48.802
A Druid girl.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.598
But she escaped last night,

07:52.723 --> 07:53.766
here in Camelot.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.851
Don't worry, we'll soon find her.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.936
Have some guards help with the search.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.982
You need to warn them, Sire.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.400
The girl is dangerous.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.570
My informer told me she was cursed.

08:06.904 --> 08:07.905
UTHER: How so?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.073
He didn't know,

08:09.156 --> 08:11.784
but he said even the Druids
were frightened of her.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.494
They cast her out of the camp.

08:13.577 --> 08:16.580
It's against all the Druids beliefs
to reject those in need of care.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.082
Then why would they do such a thing?

08:19.083 --> 08:20.334
| dread to think.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.920
Set up sentries on all the gates.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.256
We should search the lower town, Sire.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.175
Someone may be harboring her.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.344
You think she had help?

08:30.427 --> 08:32.096
| saw two figures running away.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.597
Give Halig all the help he needs.

08:35.099 --> 08:37.518
| want this girl and
her accomplice found.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.438
SOLDIER: Get in line!

08:44.608 --> 08:45.776
Move along.

08:49.113 --> 08:50.280
(CRYING)

09:01.125 --> 09:02.459
SOLDIER: Hurry up.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.313
MERLIN: Freya?

09:25.691 --> 09:28.652
It's all right. It's okay. It's me.
It's Merlin.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.197
And look...

09:52.342 --> 09:53.427
It's good.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.345
Believe me, it's fit for a prince.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.066
Is that a Druid symbol?

10:11.236 --> 10:12.613
Were you born a Druid?

10:12.696 --> 10:14.406
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

10:15.073 --> 10:16.366
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.204
I'm sorry.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.580
| understand.

10:22.706 --> 10:23.957
You could never understand.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.460
| know what it's like to keep secrets.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.340
Does anyone know you have magic?

10:31.423 --> 10:32.549
Only you.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.468
And one other person.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.386
He knows,

10:37.095 --> 10:38.430
but I'm not sure he understands.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.225
| wish I was like everyone else, but...

10:41.308 --> 10:43.435
You always know deep down you're not?

10:44.645 --> 10:45.979
Because I'm cursed.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.648
Freya, don't say that.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.150
Magic doesn't have to be a curse.

10:50.901 --> 10:51.985
It can be a gift.

10:54.738 --> 10:55.906
(SIGHS)

11:01.745 --> 11:02.830
Look.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.795
(CHANTING)

11:24.309 --> 11:25.519
Beautiful.

11:40.284 --> 11:41.493
| have to go.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.453
Someone might notice I'm missing.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.289
But I'll come back

11:47.207 --> 11:48.625
and I'll bring you some more food.

11:48.709 --> 11:49.793
(LAUGHS)

11:51.712 --> 11:53.130
| promise.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.973
Do you know anything about the girl?

12:03.515 --> 12:04.600
What girl?

12:04.683 --> 12:06.393
The girl from the cage.
She escaped last night.

12:07.853 --> 12:08.979
Good. I'm pleased.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.314
They're out hunting for her.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.690
Why can't they just let her be?

12:12.691 --> 12:13.859
Did you help her escape?

12:14.651 --> 12:15.819
No...

12:15.986 --> 12:17.070
Merlin!

12:17.154 --> 12:19.114
You told me not to get involved.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.866
You promise me you had
nothing to do with this?

12:21.033 --> 12:22.159
Yes!

12:28.540 --> 12:29.583
Good,

12:30.500 --> 12:32.753
because when Halig
finds out who helped her,

12:33.086 --> 12:35.255
| wouldn't want to be in their shoes.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.555
Would you like some water with that?

12:43.680 --> 12:44.848
Mmm.

13:01.573 --> 13:02.783
| had two drumsticks.

13:02.866 --> 13:03.951
No, you didn't.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.078
Merlin, I had two drumsticks.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.371
Maybe it fell on the floor.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.550
| had sausages.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.760
You sure?

13:22.636 --> 13:23.887
They must've fallen under the table.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.055
-Merlin!
-What?

13:25.222 --> 13:27.140
You can search me, I haven't taken them.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.392
Well, where have they gone?

13:28.934 --> 13:30.227
-Strange.
-Very!

13:30.394 --> 13:31.478
Are you sure you didn't eat them?

13:32.104 --> 13:33.897
| haven't had the chance!

13:48.495 --> 13:50.247
(PANTING)

13:55.460 --> 13:56.837
It's just the Prince's leftovers.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.630
Does he know you steal his food?

13:58.922 --> 14:00.007
Not exactly.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.299
Where were you taking it?

14:01.425 --> 14:03.635
Home for my dinner.

14:03.844 --> 14:04.928
Really?

14:06.972 --> 14:09.683
The Druid girl I'm looking for,
have you seen her?

14:09.766 --> 14:10.892
No.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.644
Do you know how much money
she's worth to me?

14:13.937 --> 14:15.272
More than your life.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.315
So I'm asking you again,

14:18.150 --> 14:20.444
have you seen the Druid girl?

14:23.321 --> 14:24.489
No.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.242
(GROANS)

14:27.325 --> 14:28.452
Hold him.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.204
| think you're lying to me.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.372
I'm not.

14:32.456 --> 14:33.498
| don't believe you.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.624
ARTHUR: Halig!

14:35.625 --> 14:37.335
What do you think you're doing?

14:38.128 --> 14:39.463
We caught the boy,

14:39.588 --> 14:41.256
behaving suspiciously, Sire.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.424
ARTHUR: Merlin?

14:42.507 --> 14:45.427
He could be harboring the girl
and he's going to tell us where.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.263
Leave him alone!

14:49.181 --> 14:50.599
Merlin is my servant.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.142
He has my absolute trust.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.518
If you have a problem with him,

14:53.643 --> 14:55.479
you come to me. Do you understand?

14:56.021 --> 14:57.314
Sire.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.026
Goodnight, Merlin.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.613
Don't forget your dinner.

15:07.491 --> 15:08.658
MERLIN: Thank you.

15:10.660 --> 15:11.745
Ah!

15:11.828 --> 15:13.121
Are those my sausages?

15:13.663 --> 15:14.831
-Mmm.
-You took them?

15:15.332 --> 15:16.625
To keep you in shape.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.543
Are you saying I'm fat?

15:18.668 --> 15:19.795
No.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.296
Well, not yet.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.215
| am not fat!

15:23.548 --> 15:25.133
You see, it's working.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.189
I'm sorry I took so long.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.861
You must be hungry.

15:46.655 --> 15:47.697
What is it?

15:47.823 --> 15:49.199
-Nothing.
-But you're upset.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.367
No.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.701
Did you think I wasn't coming?

15:51.827 --> 15:52.911
| promised you I would.

15:55.247 --> 15:56.832
| scare most people away.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.501
I'm not most people.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.087
(CHUCKLES)

16:07.050 --> 16:08.552
How long had you been in that cage?

16:09.761 --> 16:10.929
A few days.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.430
-And the bounty hunter...
-Halig.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.057
How did he find you?

16:14.724 --> 16:15.892
(SNIFFS)

16:16.726 --> 16:18.186
You can't always trust people.

16:18.603 --> 16:19.729
| know.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.190
That's why I left home.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.609
Where is home?

16:24.734 --> 16:25.777
Ealdor.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.530
It's a small village.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.783
Just a few fields, a couple of cows.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.243
Nothing special.

16:35.912 --> 16:40.083
My home was next to a lake,
surrounded by the tallest mountains.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.087
In the winter the storms whipped up
the water into waves

16:44.212 --> 16:47.465
and you thought they'd crash down
and take away all the houses.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.802
But in the summer,

16:54.472 --> 16:58.310
wild flowers and light.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.478
It was like heaven.

17:00.604 --> 17:01.646
Sounds perfect.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.064
It was.

17:03.773 --> 17:04.773
Was?

17:07.068 --> 17:08.612
My family died.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.115
Have you been on your own ever since?

17:16.077 --> 17:17.412
You're not on your own anymore.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.957
I'm going to look after you,

17:21.790 --> 17:22.917
| promise.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.337
You can't look after me, no one can.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.172
| don't think you understand.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.592
I've never known anyone like you.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.017
| wish I could stay.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.227
You're going?

17:40.310 --> 17:41.311
We need to be careful.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.272
I'll come back in the morning.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.275
You know I will be back, don't you?

You're all right,

(HOWLING)

37:44.304 --> 37:45.514
(CRYING)

38:02.739 --> 38:03.866
You must hate me.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.075
No.

38:05.492 --> 38:07.077
I'm a monster.

38:07.202 --> 38:08.579
| tried to tell you.

38:09.663 --> 38:10.873
| know.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.168
| wasn't always like this.

38:14.251 --> 38:16.086
(SHUSHES) You shouldn't try to talk.

38:16.211 --> 38:17.713
There was a man.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.715
He attacked me.

38:21.008 --> 38:22.134
| didn't mean to hurt him,

38:22.217 --> 38:23.886
but I thought he was going to kill me.

38:24.219 --> 38:25.429
It was an accident.

38:25.554 --> 38:27.014
His mother was a sorceress.

38:27.556 --> 38:28.765
When she found out,

38:30.559 --> 38:32.060
that I'd killed her son.

38:33.270 --> 38:35.355
She cursed me to kill forever more.

38:38.609 --> 38:40.611
I'm going to make you better, Freya.

38:40.736 --> 38:42.070
No, Merlin.

38:42.738 --> 38:44.406
The wound is too deep.

38:45.908 --> 38:47.367
Please go.

38:48.368 --> 38:49.578
No.

38:50.621 --> 38:52.247
I'm not leaving you here.

39:18.065 --> 39:19.316
You remembered.

39:19.650 --> 39:20.901
Of course.

39:26.490 --> 39:28.951
I'm so sorry for what
that sorcerer did to you.

39:29.284 --> 39:31.286
Merlin, you have
nothing to be sorry for.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.997
There must be something I can do,
some way to save you.

39:35.332 --> 39:36.750
You've already saved me.

39:39.253 --> 39:40.754
You made me feel loved.

39:48.595 --> 39:49.972
| don't want you to go.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.101
One day, Merlin,

39:55.978 --> 39:57.312
| will repay you.

39:58.814 --> 39:59.982
| promise.

GAIUS: Merlin.

41:44.753 --> 41:45.921
| was so worried.

41:46.630 --> 41:47.923
I'm sorry, Gaius.

41:56.765 --> 41:57.974
Where's the girl?

41:59.601 --> 42:00.977
She's gone.

42:03.105 --> 42:04.272
She's dead.

42:12.239 --> 42:13.990
I'm sorry, Merlin.

42:16.993 --> 42:18.453
Truly I am.

42:42.144 --> 42:43.645
Ah! Merlin,

42:44.646 --> 42:45.897
I've been looking for you.

42:45.981 --> 42:49.985
Yeah, right. You're going to
ask me to polish your armor

42:50.110 --> 42:54.114
and to wash your clothes,
and clean your room.

43:02.330 --> 43:04.541
Something's been upsetting you,
hasn't it?

43:05.667 --> 43:06.835
Maybe.

43:09.546 --> 43:11.047
Was it when I threw water over you?

43:12.215 --> 43:13.508
(CHUCKLES)

43:15.510 --> 43:16.970
That wasn't very nice.

43:17.846 --> 43:19.139
It was a bit unfair.

43:21.183 --> 43:22.726
Like when you called me fat.

43:24.519 --> 43:25.520
Why was that unfair?

43:25.687 --> 43:27.022
Because I'm not...

(MERLIN GRUNTS)

43:32.819 --> 43:34.362
(GROANS)

43:34.738 --> 43:36.031
Still think I need to get in shape?

43:36.156 --> 43:38.283
No! No! No! No! No!

43:45.707 --> 43:46.833
That's better.

43:46.917 --> 43:48.084
Thanks.

43:51.379 --> 43:52.506
You are right, though.

43:54.841 --> 43:58.345
You need to polish my armor,
wash my clothes and clean my room.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.896
DRAGON: Merlin.

44:09.064 --> 44:10.774
Sleep well, Arthur,

44:10.899 --> 44:15.195
and when you wake may your thoughts
be only of Vivian.

44:16.279 --> 44:18.406
ARTHUR: My job, is to woo.

44:23.537 --> 44:24.579
He's enchanted.

44:24.704 --> 44:26.540
Yes, with Lady Vivian. I can see that.

44:26.623 --> 44:27.874

44:28.583 --> 44:31.086
Unhand her, or suffer the consequences.

bring war to Camelot.
