00:05.680 --> 00:08.000
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:08.119 --> 00:12.800
Finally, you have resumed
your rightful position as my first prime.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.480
- Apophis is dead.
- Gods cannot be killed.

00:19.560 --> 00:23.240
You got his body back. Getting
his mind back may not be as easy.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.360
It is good to see you, O'Neill.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.480
- You too.
- You appear to be well.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.360
Well... forget appearances.

00:43.480 --> 00:47.440
The back's gone, the knee's shot.
Forget curling.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.600
- You?
- I am well again.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.440
So I hear.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.160
Welcome back.

01:00.760 --> 01:06.680
I again pledge you my allegiance, and ask
forgiveness for succumbing to Apophis.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.840
Well, he did sorta have you over a barrel...
you bein' dead an' all.

01:10.920 --> 01:15.200
The power of the sarcophagus forced
me to believe that Apophis was my god.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.280
Sarcophagi will do that.

01:18.840 --> 01:23.040
- Dr McKenzie convinced me otherwise.
- You convinced yourself, Teal'c.

01:23.160 --> 01:27.440
All I did was shine a light on
something you already knew.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.960
You know, just for fun...

01:32.280 --> 01:35.240
I'd love to hear you say it out loud.

01:35.360 --> 01:40.160
That Apophis is a false god? That the
Goa'uld are nothing more than parasites?

01:40.280 --> 01:41.600
Yeah, that stuff.

01:41.720 --> 01:46.000
I hope to one day restore
your trust in me, O'Neill,

01:46.080 --> 01:49.640
and to return to your service,
General Hammond.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.240
What do you think?

01:58.440 --> 01:59.760
After you.

02:10.199 --> 02:14.160
- Hello, old friend.
- Master Bra'tac. It has been too long.

02:14.280 --> 02:19.720
So it has. Your friends of Earth
took great pains in bringing me here.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.600
He is deceiving you.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.360
Teal'c.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.440
Shol'va!

02:48.880 --> 02:51.840
- (squelch)
- Hoh! What are you doin'?

02:51.960 --> 02:57.560
If Teal'c won't hear the truth in words,
he must learn of it another way.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.600
(squealing)

03:00.920 --> 03:02.880
The only way left to us.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.360
- Master Bra'tac, before we proceed...
- We waste time!

04:16.480 --> 04:20.600
Please explain what you hope to achieve
by depriving Teal'c of his symbiote.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.160
I hope to save him.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.400
- By killing him?
- If necessary.

04:26.480 --> 04:31.440
See... I think we disagree on
the meaning of the word "save".

04:31.560 --> 04:37.360
You would have him remain this way,
loving a false god, spitting and cursing?

04:37.480 --> 04:38.280
No...

04:38.400 --> 04:42.360
- There may be other methods.
- I have seen your methods.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.960
You underestimate the hold
Apophis has on Teal'c's heart.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.880
In time, you will have little choice
but to lock him away,

04:50.000 --> 04:54.760
for he is far too dangerous an enemy
to have in your midst.

04:56.520 --> 05:01.040
- The rite of M'al Sharran is the only way.
- Last rite?

05:01.160 --> 05:06.160
To save Teal'c's soul, first we must
take him to the very threshold of death.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.160
On Chulak, it is said that
when a warrior is dying,

05:09.280 --> 05:12.800
the events that forge him
wash over his mind like a great wave.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.440
His whole life passes before his eyes.
We have a similar...

05:16.560 --> 05:18.360
What does that get us?

05:18.440 --> 05:22.240
Through his fever and hallucination,
he will relive his true path,

05:22.360 --> 05:24.320
buried beneath this lie.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.400
You've done this before?

05:27.440 --> 05:30.480
Twice... in my 137 years.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.120
So you know it works?

05:33.200 --> 05:36.760
Neither Jaffa had the strength
to turn back from the precipice,

05:36.880 --> 05:39.840
but I am content they died free.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.880
Teal'c would ask for nothing more.
I owe him that.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.640
Do you?

06:00.040 --> 06:01.920
He's in and out of consciousness.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.680
His temperature is rising, his BP is falling.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.920
His immune system is failing. If we don't
return his symbiote within a few hours...

06:09.000 --> 06:11.880
- Do nothing.
- I can't do that.

06:11.960 --> 06:15.640
Bra'tac made his case.
Hammond gave the go-ahead.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.920
I see. Then I will take this up with him.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.720
Do you call yourself Teal'c's friend?

06:24.840 --> 06:26.400
Of course.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.680
Then stay.

06:28.800 --> 06:34.160
When the time comes, he may need
your help to find his way back to us.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.880
Can you hear me, old friend?

06:54.560 --> 06:56.360
Kal kek ma'l, shol'va.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.680
- Then where is your god now, Teal'c?
- He will come.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.760
I don't think so, buddy.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.200
I know we've been over this a few times,
but in case you weren't listening,

07:07.320 --> 07:09.760
I am 100 per cent sure...

07:13.440 --> 07:15.720
99 per cent sure Apophis is dead.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.800
He has deceived you, O'Neill,

07:17.920 --> 07:22.920
as I have deceived you all these years,
claiming to be in the service of the Tauri.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.760
I have never left the service of
my lord Apophis, and I never will.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.120
So all that time you were
savin' the world, killin' Goa'ulds...

07:30.240 --> 07:32.880
- Subterfuge.
- Savvy.

07:32.960 --> 07:37.000
You can take my life, but you can
never take away my loyalty to my god.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.120
I die in his name.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.720
- I die for you, my lord!
- Enough.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.680
- Do you know me, Teal'c?
- You are the shol'va, Bra'tac.

07:47.760 --> 07:52.400
There was a time I was once the first
prime, loyal servant of your lord Apophis.

07:52.520 --> 07:56.040
- You were my apprentice.
- Kek tal shree, shol'va.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.880
Remember?

07:57.960 --> 07:59.920
Remember, Teal'c!

08:03.880 --> 08:06.040
It was glorious.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.200
For years we fought side by side.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.760
- In battle.
- In his name.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.080
My lord Apophis.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.800
My lord Apophis, your enemy is defeated.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.880
You have won the day.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.280
Shal met, Bra'tac.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.400
Rise.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.480
You have done well,
and will know my gratitude.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.520
You do me honour.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.360
In displaying great skill and cunning,

08:45.440 --> 08:48.880
these three most honoured
your name in battle.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.680
- Tell me of this one.
- His name is Teal'c, my lord.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.680
My apprentice... and,
with your blessing, my successor.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.280
Who was your father?

09:03.600 --> 09:06.640
- He is the son of...
- Let him speak.

09:06.720 --> 09:12.240
If he is to take your place as my first
prime, I must know he has a tongue.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.160
My father was Ro'nak,
first prime of Cronus,

09:15.240 --> 09:18.120
who was murdered for
failing to win an unwinnable battle.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.240
My family was exiled to Chulak.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.560
He failed his god.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.200
He did not.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.880
Shek kree, Teal'c!

09:27.960 --> 09:30.000
My lord, I speak only the truth.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.240
The battle could not have been won.

09:32.360 --> 09:35.960
Your father should have died trying.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.840
- He was a coward.
- My lord, my father was not.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.960
Aargh!

09:46.000 --> 09:47.960
Aargh!

09:51.960 --> 09:53.920
Uh... what was that?

09:55.360 --> 09:58.600
A conjured memory. The first of many.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.440
He's obviously in a lot of pain.
At least let me...

10:01.560 --> 10:04.360
Pain is what we seek.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.680
Teal'c's path was
laid down with suffering.

10:07.800 --> 10:12.000
- It is the path he must take to return to us.
- At the moment he's unconscious.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.200
- All the better.
- All the better?

10:14.320 --> 10:16.960
It is his unconscious mind we must reach.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.120
I know my ways are foreign to you,

10:23.240 --> 10:28.000
but I have known Teal'c longer than any
of you have lived. I have walked his path.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.160
You cannot hope to understand
the darkness in his heart as I do.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.200
Trust in me.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.440
All of you.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.880
- We do.
- Whatever you need.

10:45.320 --> 10:49.280
For the moment...
I must meditate in kelno'reem.

10:50.560 --> 10:55.760
This rite will take most of the night
and I am tired from my long journey here.

10:55.840 --> 10:59.160
In the meantime,
stay with him, speak to him.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.400
- He won't be able to hear us unless...
- Perhaps not in his mind.

11:02.480 --> 11:06.680
But in his heart. Even in silence
he will know of your presence,

11:06.760 --> 11:09.720
but your words will
force him to remember.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.760
Challenge him when he does.
Question his beliefs.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.200
Without his symbiote

11:18.280 --> 11:21.480
he will not resist reason so readily.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.960
Carter, maybe you could
show Bra'tac to the VIP room?

11:28.320 --> 11:30.280
Yes, sir.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.400
I hope you understand
how difficult it is for us

11:39.480 --> 11:43.840
to just stand by while Teal'c is in such
obvious agony, especially Dr Fraiser.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.800
Humans concern themselves
too much with pain.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.840
Yeah, we also don't approve of torture.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.880
The greater torture
would be to leave him as he is.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.520
Teal'c is strong, stronger than l.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.480
I don't know.
You're the fittest 137-year-old I know.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.800
Perhaps, but I am
nearing the end of my time.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.800
Kelno'reem is more and more difficult.

12:04.920 --> 12:09.840
The symbiote I carry within
will mature within two years.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.040
It will be my last.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.880
Why?

12:13.960 --> 12:19.320
Even if I could procure another,
the new symbiote would reject me.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.280
It is how old warriors die.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.440
Maybe we can find some way to help you.

12:24.560 --> 12:29.080
Life for the sake of life means nothing,
neither for me, nor for Teal'c.

12:31.040 --> 12:35.080
- Do you understand?
- I think I do.

12:35.320 --> 12:38.280
Either he will return to us
as we know him,

12:38.360 --> 12:40.320
or he will not return.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.720
You wanna go first?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.640
Sure.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.280
- I'll go.
- Yeah.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.560
So... explain this to me one more time.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.760
You believe that from the moment you
broke us out of that prison on Chulak,

13:25.880 --> 13:28.240
that you've been serving Apophis?

13:28.360 --> 13:32.560
Because I gotta tell ya, as your best
friend, at least in this whole wide world,

13:32.640 --> 13:35.520
that makes absolutely no sense at all.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.960
I mean, that would make you the most...

13:39.080 --> 13:42.400
ineffective double agent
in the history of double-agenting.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.920
Va'lar.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.680
- What?
- Va'lar.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.080
- Va'lar.
- Teal'c, are you all right?

13:56.880 --> 13:59.440
I met him. I spoke to him.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.280
With Apophis himself?
You were granted an audience?

14:02.400 --> 14:04.720
As a reward for my deeds in battle.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.720
A reward? When they brought
you here, you were so weak.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.120
- He punished me.
- Then you must have failed him.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.280
This day I struck down
one hundred of Apophis's enemies.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.400
You fought well, Teal'c.
None would deny that.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.680
But he is a god, and if you fail him,

14:21.160 --> 14:24.400
by sparing even one enemy's life
that was yours, he will know.

14:24.520 --> 14:29.200
This was not for the battle. What god
would punish a son for loving his father?

14:29.320 --> 14:31.040
- Your god.
- Yes, but...

14:31.160 --> 14:33.960
- Never question that again.
- (guard) Quiet!

14:38.000 --> 14:40.800
Today you served Apophis well in battle.

14:40.880 --> 14:45.520
Serve him well again tomorrow
and you may live to see another day.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.720
"Valar." Is that what he said?

14:59.840 --> 15:03.080
- I thought he said "velour".
- Velour? The fabric?

15:03.200 --> 15:05.160
- That's what I heard.
- Why say that?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.080
- Why say "valar"?
- I don't know.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.560
Va'lar was my friend.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.200
- What?
- Teal'c.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.160
O'Neill.

15:21.960 --> 15:25.560
What is happening? Why am I restrained?

15:26.720 --> 15:31.680
Well, you were sort of trying to...
kill everyone these past few weeks.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.600
I could never have harmed you.

15:34.720 --> 15:40.160
The rite of M'al Sharran has been
successful. Please release me.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.360
Yeah. Nice try, but no.

15:43.600 --> 15:47.960
I am not your enemy.
We are brothers, Daniel Jackson...

15:48.080 --> 15:50.520
Tell us about Va'lar.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.840
I have not heard that name in many years.

15:53.960 --> 15:59.240
I trained with him under Bra'tac. We
served in the personal guard of Apophis.

15:59.320 --> 16:03.200
If you do not return
my symbiote to me, I will die.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.480
What happened to him?

16:09.600 --> 16:11.760
He failed his god!

16:13.080 --> 16:15.640
His god?

16:15.720 --> 16:17.680
You mean that...

16:18.240 --> 16:22.360
scumsuckin', overdressed,
boombox-voice snake-in-the-head?

16:22.480 --> 16:26.280
Latest on our long list of dead bad guys?

16:27.960 --> 16:30.400
Colonel, his heart rate just doubled.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.000
Ha'shak!

16:34.520 --> 16:36.880
That I understood.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.760
Do you think I don't know
what you're doing to me?

16:40.880 --> 16:44.840
- We hope you do.
- No Jaffa can survive M'al Sharran!

16:44.960 --> 16:46.920
You are allowing Bra'tac to kill me!

16:47.040 --> 16:48.680
Where is he?

16:48.800 --> 16:52.520
- Shol'va! Where are you?
- BP is crashing. Let's start an IV.

16:52.640 --> 16:56.200
Where are you, shol'va?
Are you afraid to face me?

16:58.880 --> 17:00.840
Where are you?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.200
Where are you?

17:06.880 --> 17:08.839
Kel mak!

17:11.440 --> 17:15.200
(Bra'tac) Were I truly your enemy,
you would be dead.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.040
This is pointless. I am not blind.

17:20.160 --> 17:23.040
In battle, you must use all your senses.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.960
- Once again.
- You have died enough for one day.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.520
We'll begin again in the morning.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.480
Without this!

17:37.320 --> 17:40.920
Do you believe you can defeat the
first prime of Apophis in a challenge?

17:41.040 --> 17:43.240
I am the stronger.

17:57.120 --> 17:59.920
Shall I fire, and stop this waste of time?

18:00.120 --> 18:02.320
Or will you learn?

18:02.440 --> 18:05.880
- I was not prepared.
- There are no second chances in battle.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.720
You have ears to hear and eyes to see,
but you will not learn.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.560
Shall I put us both out of our misery?

18:15.360 --> 18:18.240
The choice is mine. Who can stop me?

18:19.840 --> 18:21.840
- Apophis?
- Yes.

18:21.960 --> 18:25.640
So you believe our lord Apophis
is all-seeing, all-powerful?

18:25.760 --> 18:28.040
- He is a god.
- Is he?

18:30.640 --> 18:34.000
In battle, Teal'c, faith will not save you.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.880
Blind faith least of all.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.880
Rely on your own strength
and your own wits,

18:47.920 --> 18:50.080
or you are of no use to me.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.280
I think the point Jack was trying to make
is that you're generally a logical person.

19:02.360 --> 19:08.040
Your assertion that you never left the
service of Apophis is completely illogical,

19:08.160 --> 19:10.640
almost to the point of
making no sense whatsoever.

19:10.760 --> 19:14.440
Do you not know the meaning of faith,
Daniel Jackson?

19:14.560 --> 19:16.040
I think I do.

19:16.120 --> 19:20.400
Then you should know that my faith
in Apophis is beyond question.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.560
Still, if you remember me
and you remember Jack,

19:23.680 --> 19:26.560
then you must remember
questioning your faith.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.480
Never!

19:29.160 --> 19:31.960
- Apophis is a god.
- False god.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.520
Dead false god.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.520
Your words cannot change the truth.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.760
They're not my words, Teal'c.
They're yours.

19:42.880 --> 19:47.520
You were wrong at the time - he wasn't
dead - but that's neither here nor there.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.520
- Lies!
- The point is,

19:49.600 --> 19:53.640
there was a time in your life when you
realised the Goa'uld can't all be gods.

19:53.720 --> 19:58.440
Every symbiote a Jaffa carries will try to
take a human host and become a Goa'uld.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.720
How can they all be gods?

20:00.840 --> 20:02.960
Do not test my temper, woman.

20:03.080 --> 20:06.040
- I know you honour Bra'tac.
- I said, do not test my temper!

20:06.120 --> 20:10.080
But you have no choice
but to tell Apophis of his betrayal.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.920
- Bra'tac is my master.
- Apophis is your god.

20:17.280 --> 20:21.240
If I am ever to be first prime of Apophis,
I must first honour Bra'tac.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.480
You have seen the power of Apophis.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.320
You have seen his chariots
rise from the ground,

20:26.440 --> 20:29.160
- walk through the Chaapa-ai...
- As I have done.

20:29.240 --> 20:33.880
Explain how light can leave his palm
and throw a warrior across the square!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.800
I cannot!

20:44.200 --> 20:47.160
Yet neither have I seen
a warrior greater than Bra'tac.

20:47.240 --> 20:51.840
- Then you are the servant of two masters.
- What am I to do, Drey'auc?

21:03.840 --> 21:05.800
Come to bed.

21:12.440 --> 21:16.000
(Daniel) "Woman"?
Did he just call me a woman?

21:16.120 --> 21:18.600
(O'Neill) Yes, I believe he did.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.760
He's still unconscious?

21:21.840 --> 21:25.040
(Daniel) ln and out. Obviously delirious.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.720
- How's Junior doing?
- The symbiote is fine for now.

21:34.840 --> 21:38.040
But I don't know what we're gonna do
with it if we let Teal'c die.

21:38.160 --> 21:42.520
But won't be my problem. I'll have
already resigned if we let this go that far.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.080
- Janet, I know how you feel...
- No. I'm a doctor, Sam.

21:46.200 --> 21:51.320
This goes against every part of me,
to just stand by and do nothing.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.400
I don't think that we're doing nothing.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.320
Yeah.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.960
So is it working? Has he said anything?

22:09.080 --> 22:11.480
He talked about fabric, briefly.

22:11.600 --> 22:15.320
- He just called me a woman.
- So I think it's working.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.960
Well, something's happening.

22:20.760 --> 22:24.960
It looks like we're in for the whole night.
We should take turns sitting with him.

22:25.080 --> 22:30.040
Yeah. I'll come back in a couple of hours.
Daniel, you go after me.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.560
Then I think we'll all wanna be here.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.200
Hey, Teal'c.

22:48.520 --> 22:52.080
Look, I don't know how good
I'm gonna be at this, but...

22:53.160 --> 22:56.360
I guess the important thing
is just to be there for you.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.600
Major Carter.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.960
- How can you allow them to do this?
- Teal'c...

23:06.320 --> 23:09.360
I have no wish to die, Major Carter.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.720
- You and Dr Fraiser could yet save me.
- You're not gonna die.

23:14.040 --> 23:16.840
- I am being murdered as we speak.
- We're helping you.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.880
Help me escape.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.720
- Please.
- Oh, God.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.320
Teal'c, we want you to remember.

23:28.200 --> 23:32.080
- Do you believe in a god, Major Carter?
- This isn't about me.

23:32.160 --> 23:36.760
How would it be if you were punished
for loving your god as I love mine?

23:37.440 --> 23:41.400
- It's not the same.
- I cannot help what I believe.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.960
You believe in freedom, Teal'c.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.800
You believe in justice,
in protecting people from false gods.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.680
You despise everything Apophis was.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.760
He failed his god.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.080
He... failed...

23:58.360 --> 23:59.920
God.

24:01.800 --> 24:02.840
Teal'c?

24:05.640 --> 24:07.360
Teal'c.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.120
- Why have you returned?
- I need to speak with you.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.960
- Speak now. Apophis has summoned me.
- Alone. Please.

24:17.280 --> 24:21.840
The battle did not go well.
Ra's warriors were in too great a number.

24:21.960 --> 24:26.320
- You were given a battalion.
- Ra sent gliders. We were bombarded.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.800
- There was no choice but to retreat.
- Shek kree, Va'lar.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.560
- It was the only way to save my men.
- And yourself.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.120
No! I intend to return,
and with greater numbers.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.960
I will drive Ra's warriors
from their foothold.

24:38.080 --> 24:40.800
Please... tell him I am no coward.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.440
If given the chance,
I will yet prevail, I swear it.

24:43.520 --> 24:46.640
Go to your sleeping quarters.
Wait for me there.

24:47.560 --> 24:53.000
Teal'c. It would have profited no one
merely to fight and die.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.240
You may yet wish you had.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.600
My lord, we are at your service.

25:10.920 --> 25:13.360
Who did you entrust with this campaign?

25:13.480 --> 25:17.440
Va'lar of Chulak, my lord.
A promising warrior.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.440
Yet he has returned in disgrace.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.960
Perhaps not in disgrace, my lord,
but as part of a cunning strategy:

25:31.120 --> 25:34.720
withdraw and return in greater numbers
to crush an overconfident enemy.

25:34.840 --> 25:38.240
Va'lar himself would like
to lead the second wave.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.520
- Does he?
- My lord, allow me to...

25:44.080 --> 25:46.960
Would you have done the same
in his place, Teal'c?

25:47.040 --> 25:50.240
- No, my lord.
- You would have held your ground?

25:50.320 --> 25:51.720
Yes, my lord.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.520
Then return with him
to his place of shame and kill him.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.120
Yes, my lord.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.960
Jaffa!

26:50.040 --> 26:53.160
Kek shal kree, shol'va!

27:23.560 --> 27:26.440
You may take solace for
what you are about to do, Teal'c.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.480
I should have died on this battlefield.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.840
Please tell Apophis I died well,
honouring his name.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.840
Rise.

28:21.160 --> 28:25.440
There is a small village
two or three days' walk south of the city.

28:25.520 --> 28:31.200
You may find shelter. Do not allow
yourself to be captured by either side.

28:31.520 --> 28:34.240
Teal'c, you cannot do this, even for me.

28:34.360 --> 28:37.000
- He will know.
- We shall see.

28:37.120 --> 28:42.040
I'm more willing to face punishment than
to live knowing what he will do to you.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.800
For your sake, you must.

28:44.920 --> 28:48.280
Go now, and never show your face again.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.480
He is a god, Teal'c.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.760
He will know that you have spared me.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.840
We shall see.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.720
Go.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.360
It is done.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.280
You have promise, Teal'c.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.720
You didn't stay away long.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.080
You should talk.

30:21.160 --> 30:24.120
- You can go in there, you know.
- I know.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.360
General... if Teal'c were here,
he'd say you made the right decision.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.120
If he were here...

30:36.880 --> 30:39.200
He'll be back.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.840
If not,

30:41.960 --> 30:47.880
he will be sent to a high-security facility
and placed in solitary confinement.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.960
When his symbiote matures
in four or five years...

30:54.560 --> 30:57.000
I won't do that to him, Jack.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.040
No, sir.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.120
Of course not.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.680
What is wrong, Teal'c?

31:35.960 --> 31:38.400
Three days ago I led a battalion

31:39.440 --> 31:43.400
to retake a planet
that had been occupied by Ra's army.

31:45.680 --> 31:50.640
Apophis ordered me to burn a village
of Ra's followers to the ground.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.880
(Drey'auc) You did this?

31:57.200 --> 31:59.160
Yes.

32:00.800 --> 32:05.520
Then sleep well in the knowledge
that you have served Apophis.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.800
I cannot close my eyes

32:09.520 --> 32:14.720
without seeing the innocent faces of
women and children who lived there.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.280
A Jaffa lived there also.

32:19.960 --> 32:22.120
A warrior named Va'lar.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.520
No.

32:25.600 --> 32:29.560
I banished him to that village
to save his life,

32:29.680 --> 32:34.880
only to take it away, for fear that
Apophis would learn my secret.

32:35.600 --> 32:39.800
I put my own life before that of
an entire village, and that of a dear friend.

32:39.920 --> 32:43.480
- No. You had no choice.
- I did have a choice.

32:46.440 --> 32:50.480
A son will soon be born to us, Teal'c.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.520
You must ensure that he has a father.

32:59.760 --> 33:05.200
Our son will be born into a real home,
a gift from Apophis himself.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.960
It is the best life we can hope for.

33:10.040 --> 33:12.400
Then why am I so ashamed?

33:33.000 --> 33:35.800
Tek matte! Master Bra'tac!

33:35.920 --> 33:37.880
Tek matte!

33:39.280 --> 33:42.640
Apophis has made you his first prime.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.720
- You are not pleased.
- No.

33:45.840 --> 33:50.880
There's no greater honour among Jaffa
than to become first prime to one's god.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.120
You know as well as I
what the Goa'uld truly are.

33:54.200 --> 33:58.480
We pretend, men like you and l,
so we may advance in rank and privilege.

33:58.600 --> 34:01.000
But do not pretend to me now.

34:01.120 --> 34:05.080
You know the truth. Can you
look me in the face and say otherwise?

34:05.160 --> 34:08.880
My entire life you have
prepared me for this day. Why?

34:09.600 --> 34:15.120
I saw the spark of doubt in you, and the
wisdom to keep that doubt unto yourself.

34:15.199 --> 34:18.639
I saw you play the game
with those who would play god.

34:18.760 --> 34:21.239
If I do not believe in him, how can I serve?

34:21.360 --> 34:25.880
Because there is no other choice
but to serve. The Goa'uld are powerful.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.679
They have seen to it that we cannot live
without them, and so it may always be.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.920
But neither can they live without the Jaffa.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.440
- We are their true power.
- I do not understand.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.520
As first prime, that power will be yours.

34:42.639 --> 34:47.440
When Apophis throws his armies into the
fire, you will be there to temper his sword.

34:47.560 --> 34:51.840
In so doing, you may save countless lives,
as I have done in my time.

34:52.120 --> 34:55.880
And you have done all these things
against his will?

34:56.880 --> 34:59.040
His will can be made to bend.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.760
But not always.

35:04.560 --> 35:09.000
I have done deeds for which
I cannot forgive even myself,

35:09.080 --> 35:11.360
as will you.

35:11.480 --> 35:14.680
Men such as you and I have
only the comfort of those times.

35:14.760 --> 35:17.040
We make a difference.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.480
Make a difference.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.080
(crying)

35:53.640 --> 35:55.600
There.

35:57.840 --> 36:02.040
Those are the humans
who came through the Chaapa-ai.

36:03.440 --> 36:06.480
They do not appear to be
as formidable as I imagined.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.680
Their weapons are not of Goa'uld design.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.520
That may be so, Teal'c...
but they are only three.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.880
They have something more.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.960
A strength.

36:18.800 --> 36:22.000
They know the taste of freedom.

36:22.080 --> 36:26.560
Your dreams of freedom
will be your undoing, Teal'c.

36:26.680 --> 36:30.320
- Perhaps so.
- Pray they are not chosen as hosts.

36:30.440 --> 36:33.240
That is the best fate
you can wish for them.

36:41.800 --> 36:45.280
- What have I done?
- (monitorbeeps rapidly)

36:49.560 --> 36:51.520
He's in v-fib! Get the cart!

36:52.200 --> 36:55.400
- This is it.
- Get Bra'tac down here.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.520
- I'm returning the symbiote.
- Stand aside.

37:06.640 --> 37:09.040
- If I don't return it immediately...
- Stand aside!

37:09.160 --> 37:12.400
Or his suffering
will have been for nothing.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.720
This is the moment
when he must choose.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.760
Stand aside, Dr Fraiser.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.360
Choose now, Teal'c.

37:30.480 --> 37:35.600
Return to those who love freedom,
or die in the name of a false god.

37:36.640 --> 37:37.960
Choose!

37:49.440 --> 37:51.360
Shaka ha!

37:51.480 --> 37:54.600
Kree hol mel, Goa'uld!

37:54.680 --> 37:56.920
Choose to be the warrior we know!

37:57.840 --> 38:00.800
Renounce Apophis and return to us!

38:01.080 --> 38:03.040
It's now or never.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.200
Choose!

38:23.440 --> 38:25.400
- Very well.
- Let's move.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.160
- Kill the rest.
- (screaming)

38:34.280 --> 38:36.320
Symbiote's in.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.320
No change.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.480
- We waited too long. Charge to 200.
- Charging.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.520
Clear.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.520
(prisoners screaming)

38:53.800 --> 38:55.120
No pulse.

38:55.240 --> 38:58.800
- Make it 360. Give me five of epi.
- Charging.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.320
Clear.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.760
I can save these people!

39:05.200 --> 39:07.240
Help me!

39:08.120 --> 39:10.240
Help me.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.360
Many have said that.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.440
But you are the first I believe could do it.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.920
I choose freedom.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.920
The rite has succeeded.

39:57.040 --> 39:59.200
He has returned to us.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.120
Uh...

40:02.240 --> 40:04.680
Just out of curiosity...

40:06.320 --> 40:09.680
- How do you feel about...?
- Apophis is a false god.

40:10.680 --> 40:13.480
A dead false god.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.200
Huh?

40:21.680 --> 40:26.040
That's good enough for me.
Get him out of those restraints.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.240
Thank you, Doctor. Well done.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.480
Yes, sir. I'm glad it worked out too.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.440
- Hey, Teal'c.
- Major Carter.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.880
Daniel Jackson.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.280
- Tek matte.
- My friend.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.920
General Hammond.

40:52.040 --> 40:57.880
I once again pledge my allegiance
to you and the people of this world

40:58.000 --> 41:01.960
and I request permission
to return to SG-1 .

41:03.920 --> 41:06.480
Permission granted.
