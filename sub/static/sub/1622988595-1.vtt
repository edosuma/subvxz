02:11.267 --> 02:13.100
You said a man wants to see me.

02:13.183 --> 02:14.683
Alley out back.

02:17.725 --> 02:21.308
- He can't come in here?
- What is he, white?

02:23.600 --> 02:25.308
Oh, boy. Man.

02:26.350 --> 02:27.517
Who is he?

02:27.600 --> 02:28.933
Never met him before,

02:29.017 --> 02:30.475
but he said his boss
was looking

02:30.558 --> 02:32.558
for a reliable guy
to do some work.

02:32.642 --> 02:33.850
Who's his boss, Jimmy?

02:33.933 --> 02:35.267
No one I knew.

02:35.350 --> 02:37.892
But I heard you were looking
for something quick.

02:39.850 --> 02:41.308
See, I thought
we were cool, man.

02:41.392 --> 02:42.850
Mmm-hmm.

02:42.933 --> 02:44.517
And now you're gonna bring me
into some sketchy shit?

02:44.600 --> 02:45.808
Yeah.

02:45.892 --> 02:47.225
Well, you're lucky
anybody's calling

02:47.308 --> 02:49.433
after that Gotham Hotel mess.

02:51.850 --> 02:54.267
Now, I get my fee
no matter what.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.725
Just go hear the man out.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.642
Give me your Roscoe.

03:01.725 --> 03:05.475
Curtis, now that's...
Curtis. Curtis.

03:06.808 --> 03:09.475
See? Trouble.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.100
Just trouble.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.517
You Curt?

03:44.600 --> 03:45.975
Who are you?

03:46.058 --> 03:47.725
Jones.

03:47.808 --> 03:49.892
You work for Frank?

03:49.975 --> 03:53.475
I've done work
for Frank. This is not Frank.

03:53.558 --> 03:55.017
Okay, 'cause if he's in,
I'm out.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.683
What did I just tell you?

03:58.058 --> 03:59.267
Watkins?

04:01.642 --> 04:04.100
Do I look like I work
for Aldrick Watkins?

04:09.475 --> 04:11.017
So what's the score?

04:25.017 --> 04:27.225
We're sending a man
that works in an office

04:27.308 --> 04:29.058
to pick something up
from that office

04:29.142 --> 04:31.350
and bring it back to his home.

04:31.433 --> 04:33.600
You are part of
a babysitting team

04:33.683 --> 04:38.225
watching his family while
he does it. No one gets hurt.

04:38.308 --> 04:40.558
Three hours of work.

04:40.642 --> 04:45.058
For this, I'm offering
you two grand now,

04:45.142 --> 04:46.892
and three on the other end.

04:50.058 --> 04:51.725
For three hours?

04:51.808 --> 04:54.600
They said that your number
was five grand.

04:54.683 --> 04:57.183
Is this something
you think you can do?

04:57.267 --> 04:59.100
Then he
calls me an opportunist,

04:59.183 --> 05:02.100
like being married to him
is some kind of opportunity.

05:02.183 --> 05:04.725
When he's out doing,
you know, whatever.

05:05.975 --> 05:07.600
You know how he gets.

05:07.683 --> 05:12.725
Well, you used to, and it is
way worse, now that he's fancy.

05:12.808 --> 05:14.892
Do you think
I'm a schemer, Ronald?

05:16.225 --> 05:18.350
I think you have
ulterior motives.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.517
But I find that sexy.

05:22.392 --> 05:25.267
Oh, I get it.

05:25.350 --> 05:27.350
So, this is my scheme, is it?

05:29.975 --> 05:31.850
Don't kid yourself, Ronald.

05:31.933 --> 05:35.100
We both know who
you're really fucking here.

05:35.975 --> 05:37.100
How could you say that?

05:40.433 --> 05:42.683
Oh, and that's another thing
that ticks me off.

05:42.767 --> 05:45.225
How many times a week
do I put on this dress?

05:45.308 --> 05:46.600
And he has yet to notice

05:46.683 --> 05:48.308
I couldn't hit a tennis ball
to save my life.

05:48.392 --> 05:50.933
I can't reward
that kind of inattentiveness.

05:52.433 --> 05:53.725
I simply will not.

05:56.350 --> 05:57.392
You look cute.

05:58.808 --> 05:59.767
Come here.

06:00.517 --> 06:02.267
Oh.

06:03.475 --> 06:04.808
Mmm. Lipstick.

06:07.892 --> 06:09.475
Do you love me?

06:09.558 --> 06:11.725
Of course I love you, Ronald.

06:11.808 --> 06:13.267
You better.

06:25.225 --> 06:26.142
Psst.

06:28.350 --> 06:29.392
Hey.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.433
We're almost there, okay?

06:34.517 --> 06:35.808
I'll be calling you.

07:20.142 --> 07:21.975
Where's the fire? It's five of.

07:22.058 --> 07:25.433
Really?
My watch must be fast.

07:28.058 --> 07:28.975
Well?

07:31.267 --> 07:32.767
Close the door behind you.

07:39.892 --> 07:42.642
Imagine my surprise
when I got your call.

07:44.350 --> 07:48.058
Self-interest is the
sincerest form of flattery.

07:49.475 --> 07:51.100
They want you, Ronald,

07:51.183 --> 07:53.767
much as I mighta tried
to dissuade them.

07:53.850 --> 07:56.100
Then are you gonna
tell me who they are?

07:56.183 --> 07:58.683
Because this "Outfit outta
Chicago" ain't gonna do it.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.433
No, they're not prepared
to do that.

08:02.850 --> 08:06.350
If Frank is involved,
you can let yourself out the door.

08:06.433 --> 08:09.475
Everyone has a problem
with Frank these days.

08:09.558 --> 08:10.600
Who's "everyone"?

08:10.683 --> 08:13.850
For our purposes, no one.

08:13.933 --> 08:17.475
Look, they agreed
to match your price.

08:17.558 --> 08:22.392
Three grand up front,
4,500 upon completion.

08:31.850 --> 08:33.392
What's this?

08:33.475 --> 08:35.142
What?

08:35.225 --> 08:38.308
You think I'd be
all right with that?

08:38.392 --> 08:41.808
Maybe that's how they do things
in Chicago now. But not here.

08:41.892 --> 08:43.517
All right, give me
that envelope back.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.058
I'm gonna find someone else.

08:49.975 --> 08:52.267
He sits up front.

08:52.350 --> 08:54.767
You're not gonna get stabbed
in the neck, Ronald.

08:54.850 --> 08:56.308
I like to sit in the back.

08:56.392 --> 08:57.725
So sit in the back.

09:09.058 --> 09:13.142
Mister, you mind
sitting up front?

09:14.392 --> 09:15.392
I do.

09:20.517 --> 09:21.933
I'd like to sit in the back.

09:22.017 --> 09:24.850
This is ridiculous.
We're wasting time.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.017
Be my guest.

09:34.058 --> 09:38.225
Curt, meet Ronald.
Ronald, Curt.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.017
The other man's inside.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.558
Now there's another man?

09:49.642 --> 09:50.975
It's a three-man job.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.350
You never said that.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.975
He said we wasn't
gonna be working alone.

09:56.058 --> 09:57.392
So who's this fucking guy?

09:57.475 --> 09:58.392
Charley.

09:58.475 --> 10:00.267
Not that guy. This fucking guy.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.725
And who the fuck is Charley?

10:01.808 --> 10:04.058
Like you, I'm meeting
'em both today, too.

10:07.433 --> 10:10.350
Do we need
to go over anything?

10:10.433 --> 10:13.058
Instructions seemed
pretty clear to me.

10:13.142 --> 10:14.767
Ask Sambo.

10:17.142 --> 10:18.392
Name's Curt.

10:18.475 --> 10:21.558
Like he told you
in the car.

10:21.642 --> 10:22.975
You're Curt Goynes.

10:25.475 --> 10:26.933
You didn't hear about this guy?

10:27.017 --> 10:28.392
Why would I?

10:28.475 --> 10:30.308
I don't know anybody
that knows him.

10:30.392 --> 10:31.308
Hmm.

10:32.683 --> 10:33.892
Well, you know Frank.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.725
Frank who?

10:36.808 --> 10:38.308
No. Frank Capelli.

10:39.975 --> 10:42.475
How do you know Frank Capelli?

10:42.558 --> 10:44.683
I met him once, briefly.

10:45.433 --> 10:46.267
Oh.

10:46.350 --> 10:47.933
Yeah, and if you're Ronald,

10:48.017 --> 10:50.350
then you got to
be Ronald Russo,

10:50.433 --> 10:52.892
'cause you sure as hell
match the description.

10:52.975 --> 10:54.850
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

10:56.392 --> 10:58.975
You seem worried about
how you might be described.

10:59.808 --> 11:01.142
Let's be clear,

11:01.225 --> 11:02.683
the only thing
I'm worried about

11:02.767 --> 11:04.933
is this thing getting fucked up
because of you.

11:06.017 --> 11:07.350
What's that supposed to mean?

11:09.058 --> 11:10.142
It's not your fault.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.933
You were born like that.

11:13.017 --> 11:14.058
Born like what?

11:14.142 --> 11:15.308
Okay.

11:15.392 --> 11:17.267
All right. This isn't why
we were hired.

11:17.350 --> 11:20.767
And who did hire us,
Charley, huh?

11:20.850 --> 11:22.100
You gonna tell me straight up

11:22.183 --> 11:23.767
this ain't some
Frank Capelli production?

11:23.850 --> 11:26.017
No. No, no, no, no.

11:26.100 --> 11:29.142
It's, uh, some outfit
out of Illinois,

11:29.225 --> 11:31.808
wants to expand to Detroit.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.308
The guy pitched it like

11:33.392 --> 11:35.683
"get in on the ground floor"
kind of thing.

11:35.767 --> 11:40.308
They grow their presence and we have an in.
Kind of thing.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.600
What's with the fucking eye?

11:47.308 --> 11:49.683
Sometimes when people lie,

11:49.767 --> 11:53.600
they tend to over-explain.
Kind of thing.

11:55.767 --> 11:58.517
So he's been
running numbers for Watkins,

11:58.600 --> 12:00.975
but then decides that he wants
a little bit of his own turf.

12:01.058 --> 12:04.600
And Watkins stakes him,
like, 25 g's.

12:04.683 --> 12:08.017
But Goynes wants
a bigger score.

12:08.100 --> 12:11.058
Exactly. They always do.

12:12.267 --> 12:14.308
They're never satisfied.

12:14.392 --> 12:15.767
So he goes to the Italians

12:15.850 --> 12:17.808
and he sets up this big meeting
at the Gotham.

12:17.892 --> 12:19.517
And he wants to play
them off each other.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.183
You know, the blacks
and the Italians.

12:21.267 --> 12:25.058
But Watkins gets tipped off

12:25.142 --> 12:28.017
and things get
really fucking ugly.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.600
Both sides lose people,

12:29.683 --> 12:31.725
Watkins loses his 25k.

12:31.808 --> 12:33.558
And both blame Goynes.

12:33.642 --> 12:38.142
But not for the deaths because
that's, you know... people.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.517
The big thing?

12:42.142 --> 12:45.683
Watkins' code book
goes missing.

12:45.767 --> 12:50.142
Every bet, every debt,
every bribe, every payoff.

12:50.225 --> 12:52.933
The real names.
Ten years' worth.

12:54.183 --> 12:56.433
So he has Watkins'
code book, huh?

12:56.517 --> 12:58.392
That gets
out in the open,

12:58.475 --> 13:00.475
everybody's going down.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.100
Cologne again.

13:42.183 --> 13:45.017
Hmm? Oh, yes.

13:45.100 --> 13:48.933
Mary. Yes, I do.
I sometimes wear cologne.

13:50.183 --> 13:53.142
Maybe it covers up
the other odors.

13:53.225 --> 13:55.642
Yeah. Sure. Maybe that's it.

14:00.475 --> 14:02.600
So I was awake for
a while last night.

14:03.933 --> 14:05.642
How is that news?

14:05.725 --> 14:08.017
That is not news.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.308
<i>Matthew?</i>

14:10.892 --> 14:12.267
Mattie?

14:12.350 --> 14:13.392
There's no clean socks.

14:13.475 --> 14:14.808
Just borrow some
from your father.

14:14.892 --> 14:16.225
Dad's are too big.

14:16.308 --> 14:18.475
They're not that big.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.267
Peg, you need help
tying those?

14:20.350 --> 14:21.267
No.

14:21.350 --> 14:22.642
You sure?
'Cause I can...

14:22.725 --> 14:23.892
I don't need help.

14:23.975 --> 14:25.475
Okay. Amy's coming early

14:25.558 --> 14:27.267
so you can set up
show and tell.

14:27.350 --> 14:28.517
I know.

14:55.017 --> 14:56.183
Good morning.

14:57.475 --> 14:58.850
Hey, shh, shh, shh.

14:58.933 --> 15:00.100
Don't.

15:00.183 --> 15:01.517
Shh, shh, shh.

15:01.600 --> 15:06.225
This is a typical morning.
Nothing changes. Okay?

15:06.308 --> 15:09.350
Now, what would you do now,

15:10.892 --> 15:12.517
normal Monday?

15:14.933 --> 15:17.017
I would make breakfast.

15:18.225 --> 15:19.683
Well, there you go then.

15:21.392 --> 15:23.517
What do you want?

15:23.600 --> 15:26.808
Is that something
you'd say, normal Monday?

15:30.058 --> 15:31.308
I don't know.

15:35.183 --> 15:40.058
Can I just... Can I just...
Oh, God. Oh, God. Thank you.

15:53.267 --> 15:55.767
Mom. Mom?

15:55.850 --> 15:57.558
Go ahead. Move.

15:59.267 --> 16:01.100
It's okay, Matthew.

16:06.058 --> 16:07.850
Hi, kiddo.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.142
Good morning.

16:18.017 --> 16:20.100
Everything is normal, Matthew,

16:20.183 --> 16:23.642
exactly like any other Monday.
Except...

16:25.017 --> 16:26.600
So, have a seat.

16:28.850 --> 16:31.517
It's fine.
Go ahead, sit down.

16:39.892 --> 16:42.683
It's okay. It's okay.

16:48.517 --> 16:50.017
So, Matthew...

16:54.225 --> 16:56.808
are you a Sugar Smacks guy
or a Trix guy?

16:56.892 --> 17:01.225
Can you please stop pretending
this is a normal conversation?

17:01.308 --> 17:02.475
Matthew.

17:03.433 --> 17:04.433
Sit.

17:18.017 --> 17:19.099
Dad?

17:20.683 --> 17:23.308
What is this? Who are you?

17:23.392 --> 17:26.474
Go on. Get in there.

17:29.308 --> 17:31.392
Mary? Mary, are you all right?

17:31.475 --> 17:34.058
- What's happening?
- We're okay. It's okay, Matt.

17:34.142 --> 17:35.558
Why are these guys
in our house?

17:35.642 --> 17:37.433
Hi, Matt.
Good morning.

17:37.517 --> 17:41.725
There is a document in a green
safe in your boss's office.

17:41.808 --> 17:45.225
You and me are gonna go get it.
These guys are gonna babysit.

17:45.308 --> 17:48.350
- What are you...
- Everyone is going to be fine

17:48.433 --> 17:50.683
as long as we get
what's in that safe

17:50.767 --> 17:52.350
by 10:00 a.m.

17:52.433 --> 17:54.642
- Can you shut your fucking kid up?
- She's a child.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.183
I don't care. Keep it quiet.

17:56.267 --> 17:58.517
Come on, I'll take you
to the playroom. It's okay.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.392
Okay, we're gonna go
to the playroom.

18:00.475 --> 18:02.267
Hey. Stay in sight.

18:02.350 --> 18:04.017
If you want her quiet,

18:04.100 --> 18:06.683
then let her go into her goddamn
playroom, Jesus Christ.

18:06.767 --> 18:08.267
- We...
- Mary.

18:08.892 --> 18:09.975
Sorry.

18:12.183 --> 18:13.933
- Feisty.
- Come on.

18:15.308 --> 18:16.975
Hey,
put her in the room

18:18.350 --> 18:19.767
and you sit right there.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.725
It's okay.

18:22.808 --> 18:25.350
I'll be right here, okay.
I'll be right here.

18:36.808 --> 18:37.808
Hey.

18:39.767 --> 18:43.600
Forbert won't be in the office
all week. My boss.

18:44.517 --> 18:46.350
- Mel Forbert?
- Hey.

18:48.350 --> 18:50.475
I don't have
the combination to that safe.

18:50.558 --> 18:52.267
That's okay,
his secretary does.

18:52.350 --> 18:53.933
And from what we understand,

18:54.017 --> 18:56.308
you have the combo
to his secretary.

19:08.017 --> 19:11.767
Do you mind if we have this
conversation without my son present?

19:11.850 --> 19:14.683
Do I mind? Pleasure.

19:16.850 --> 19:18.517
Matthew, go to your sister.

19:21.058 --> 19:23.683
Matthew, go to your sister.

19:38.558 --> 19:40.308
Dad,
he knows Mr. Forbert.

19:40.392 --> 19:42.142
He doesn't know anybody.

19:42.225 --> 19:43.392
Get in the room.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.975
Hey, do not be a hero.

19:48.058 --> 19:50.933
Do you understand me? Do not.

19:51.017 --> 19:52.725
All right. Go on.

19:55.475 --> 19:58.433
Hey, listen to your father.
Get over there.

20:07.433 --> 20:08.433
Hey.

20:11.433 --> 20:12.808
I'm not allowed in that safe.

20:12.892 --> 20:14.642
I'm not interested
in any of that.

20:15.808 --> 20:17.225
You'll figure it out.

20:53.808 --> 20:56.267
He sure wasn't smiling like
this when we said that thing

20:56.350 --> 20:58.475
about the combo
to his secretary.

20:59.308 --> 21:00.558
Drop it.

21:00.642 --> 21:02.725
Actually, there is something
I'd like to know.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.433
Psst.

21:21.392 --> 21:22.517
Answer it.

21:28.308 --> 21:30.767
Oh, darn.

21:30.850 --> 21:33.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Door is that way.

21:33.225 --> 21:34.183
Bird feeders.

21:34.267 --> 21:36.642
- What?
- Just... This way.

21:50.517 --> 21:54.058
- Is Peggy here for carpool?
- Ah, sorry, Amy.

21:54.142 --> 21:55.600
I forgot to call your mom

21:55.683 --> 21:57.350
and let her know that
Peggy's staying home today.

21:57.433 --> 21:59.850
So, I'm so sorry. But, here,
you're gonna have to do

21:59.933 --> 22:03.142
the hummingbird thing all by
yourself, okay? So sorry.

22:10.308 --> 22:13.767
Just tell your mom
everything's fine. Okay?

22:13.850 --> 22:15.308
- Mmm-hmm.
- We're good.

22:16.475 --> 22:17.725
Bye.

22:28.308 --> 22:31.225
Well, I don't think
that's the end of that.

22:35.475 --> 22:37.100
Yeah. No, it's not.

22:44.350 --> 22:45.933
- Hi, Dawn.
- You okay?

22:46.017 --> 22:47.475
Everything's fine.

22:47.558 --> 22:50.308
- Mary?
- No, I'll call you later, okay?

22:50.392 --> 22:52.017
Everything's fine.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.142
Had a fight and Peg's real
upset, and we're just gonna

22:54.225 --> 22:56.308
stay home and sort it out.
So...

22:56.392 --> 22:59.517
Oh, I'm very sorry
about the bird feeder.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.517
- You sure?
- Yeah. It's fine. I'm fine.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.683
Everyone... Everyone's fine.
It's fine. Seriously.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.017
Okay.

23:08.100 --> 23:12.267
I'll call you later.
Okay? Bye.

23:12.350 --> 23:13.517
Bye.

23:21.100 --> 23:25.225
That was good work, Mary.
You're a fine actress.

23:25.308 --> 23:26.767
Come here.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.933
They don't want to hurt us.

23:32.017 --> 23:33.850
That's why
they're wearing masks.

23:40.267 --> 23:42.683
Okay. Now what?

23:42.767 --> 23:44.517
You got 30 minutes.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.975
Look, it's not that easy.
All right?

23:48.058 --> 23:49.225
I can't just walk in there...

23:49.308 --> 23:52.017
Twenty-nine minutes
and 54 seconds

23:52.100 --> 23:53.642
my boss calls your house.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.558
Fifty-one. Fifty...

23:59.725 --> 24:01.392
Good boy.

24:30.267 --> 24:31.683
Good morning, Mr. Wertz.

24:31.767 --> 24:33.767
The weeklies are in
and Mr. Forbert needs you to

24:33.850 --> 24:36.392
compare them to the budget because
I guess they underestimated...

24:36.475 --> 24:42.350
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right.
Okay. Good. Yeah. Okay. Good.

24:42.433 --> 24:45.058
You can just leave those.
Uh, I'll just...

24:46.225 --> 24:48.100
Leave them there.

25:12.558 --> 25:15.142
- You told her.
- What?

25:15.225 --> 25:19.808
Oh my God, you did it.
Was she okay?

25:19.892 --> 25:22.725
Is it strange that I'm actually
worried about Mary?

25:22.808 --> 25:26.558
What? What? No. I didn't.
I didn't. I was gonna tell her.

25:26.642 --> 25:31.183
I was gonna tell her and then Peggy
had a bird feeder thing and I'm... I...

25:31.267 --> 25:34.558
It doesn't matter. And now's
there another thing and I just...

25:34.642 --> 25:36.475
- Okay. Right.
- I told Phil.

25:36.558 --> 25:38.892
- Uh-huh.
- As per our promise.

25:40.267 --> 25:42.350
I need to get into the green
safe right now.

25:42.433 --> 25:46.183
Why? He cried, Matt.
Phil. He cried.

25:46.267 --> 25:49.058
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What...
The combination to the green safe is what?

25:49.142 --> 25:51.808
I came to work
from the Humpty Dumpty Motel.

25:51.892 --> 25:54.892
I'm sorry. I need the
combination to the green safe.

25:54.975 --> 26:01.100
Oh, "I"? "I," Matt? Because what about
our thing? Because I have information.

26:01.183 --> 26:04.433
- What drawer do you keep it in?
- It is not in a drawer.

26:04.517 --> 26:07.808
Everything will be fine.
I promise you.

26:07.892 --> 26:09.850
Yeah, sure,
another "promise."

26:09.933 --> 26:12.600
I am going to tell her.
I don't...

26:15.475 --> 26:21.642
We're fine. I'm fine.
We're f... We're fine.

26:21.725 --> 26:24.850
Well, did you even talk to the
guy like you were supposed to?

26:24.933 --> 26:28.225
Yes! But, no. I...

26:30.017 --> 26:31.392
I'll call you.

26:33.058 --> 26:37.308
But, Matt! Matt, what are you...
You can't... You can't...

26:39.225 --> 26:43.433
You can't do this.
Matt, you can't do this. Wait.

27:01.308 --> 27:04.892
He took it, Matt.
That's what I was trying to tell you.

27:05.850 --> 27:07.475
Why would Mel Forbert...

27:07.558 --> 27:09.267
Why would Mel Forbert what?

27:10.308 --> 27:13.850
Naismith.
He moved on it anyway.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.267
"Anyway"?

27:15.350 --> 27:17.725
- Oh, Paula, this is bad.
- What do you mean "anyway"?

27:17.808 --> 27:19.600
- What?
- This is bad.

27:19.683 --> 27:23.267
Matt? What do you mean
"Naismith"?

27:45.308 --> 27:47.433
Are we finished?
Can I... Can I go home now?

27:49.725 --> 27:52.933
Wait at the house after,
I'll call with instructions.

27:57.725 --> 28:01.308
Okay, wouldn't mind
stopping for some fries first.

28:01.392 --> 28:04.558
Well, he said that we should go
home and he'd... he'd call us.

28:04.642 --> 28:08.642
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Uh, let's go. We'll go...

28:08.725 --> 28:11.808
Let's go home now.
I just want to see my family.

28:16.058 --> 28:19.433
So, how does
he know my dad's boss?

28:19.517 --> 28:22.350
He doesn't.
I already told you that.

28:24.892 --> 28:28.642
Did he...
Did he work there or something? At GM?

28:28.725 --> 28:30.767
I don't know.
I just met him, like you.

28:30.850 --> 28:32.892
So how do you
know he doesn't?

28:43.017 --> 28:44.933
Why are you doing this?

28:47.850 --> 28:50.475
There's a piece of land
out there.

28:51.767 --> 28:54.975
A man took it from me
and I want it back.

28:56.558 --> 28:58.142
Where?

28:58.225 --> 29:00.683
Look, kid, we're gonna be out of
your hair in about 15 minutes.

29:00.767 --> 29:02.475
Okay? Just relax.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.558
Is my dad gonna be okay?

29:13.975 --> 29:18.267
- Mister.
- Yeah, that's the plan. Okay?

29:28.142 --> 29:29.975
Can I go see my mom, please?

29:33.725 --> 29:35.017
Thank you.

29:42.933 --> 29:45.767
What happened to your plane?
It run out of gas?

29:45.850 --> 29:48.392
Actually, it crashed.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.850
You want to go
see your mom, too?

29:54.558 --> 29:55.808
No.

30:00.558 --> 30:01.933
What did he mean "after"?

30:03.475 --> 30:05.350
What?

30:05.433 --> 30:09.267
He said "Wait at the house
after." After what?

30:12.100 --> 30:13.808
After we get there.

30:24.183 --> 30:25.975
How do you do it?

30:29.642 --> 30:32.600
I don't like
doing the dishes either.

30:32.683 --> 30:35.933
I... I don't know why,
but I can't bring myself to do them.

30:36.017 --> 30:38.225
I don't want to know
anything about you.

30:41.433 --> 30:44.392
- We're more alike than you think.
- Please stop.

30:48.225 --> 30:49.225
Well...

30:54.350 --> 30:59.267
What if you don't want the things
that you're supposed to want? Hmm?

31:09.558 --> 31:11.475
Keys in the ignition.

31:11.558 --> 31:12.850
What? Why?

31:12.933 --> 31:14.808
'Cause that's
what I said to do.

31:17.725 --> 31:20.725
- Hey, your mask.
- Uh, it itches.

31:30.183 --> 31:32.392
- Matt?
- We're good. It's done.

31:32.475 --> 31:34.142
Okay, I need everyone
in the living room. Now.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.642
- Why? What is going on?
- What's going on, big guy?

31:38.517 --> 31:41.850
Hey, family. I need the whole
family in the living room now.

31:41.933 --> 31:43.392
Where's the, uh, girl?

31:43.475 --> 31:44.600
The little one? The little girl?
Where's your...

31:44.683 --> 31:46.183
- Peg.
- She's in here.

31:46.267 --> 31:47.683
Well, get her then.
Will you give me a hand here?

31:47.767 --> 31:49.517
Hold on a minute,
mister. Hold on, okay?

31:49.600 --> 31:50.933
You're scaring them and they
have been scared enough.

31:51.017 --> 31:52.683
Yeah, what are we doing here,
Charley?

31:52.767 --> 31:54.767
We're following instructions.
Living room.

31:54.850 --> 31:56.683
Are you helping me
or are you not helping me?

31:56.767 --> 31:59.350
No, no, no, no. The man in the
alley said that you would wait here

31:59.433 --> 32:01.558
and he would call you
with instructions.

32:01.642 --> 32:03.058
Those are
other instructions,

32:03.142 --> 32:05.100
which are none
of your business.

32:05.183 --> 32:07.558
The instructions at present are to
get your family in the living room

32:07.642 --> 32:09.267
close together.
Do you understand me?

32:09.350 --> 32:12.183
- Sir, I must respectfully ask that...
- Ah, fuck.

32:17.350 --> 32:18.767
What the fuck was that about?

32:18.850 --> 32:21.767
Put it down. Ronald.
Ronald, just think.

32:21.850 --> 32:24.267
- I am not putting it down.
- All right. It was a setup, man.

32:24.350 --> 32:27.933
Think. Think.
It's a setup, man.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.267
Where's his mask, man?
Huh?

32:32.350 --> 32:34.142
- This is wrong.
- Think, Ronald.

32:34.225 --> 32:36.142
Someone answer
the fucking phone!

32:36.225 --> 32:39.725
Calm down, man.

32:39.808 --> 32:41.392
Relax.

32:41.475 --> 32:43.183
Answer the phone.

32:46.142 --> 32:47.475
Hello?

32:47.558 --> 32:48.850
<i>Who is this?</i>

32:48.933 --> 32:52.183
Mary Wertz. Who is this?

32:52.267 --> 32:54.517
<i>Put the one on
who just came back.</i>

32:55.975 --> 33:00.392
Um, he's just...

33:00.475 --> 33:04.267
He's not with us.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.017
<i>Put your husband on.</i>

33:07.933 --> 33:09.850
He wants to talk to you.

33:09.933 --> 33:11.058
Yes?

33:11.142 --> 33:12.683
<i>What were you thinking,
Matthew?</i>

33:12.767 --> 33:14.308
<i>I'm actually asking.</i>

33:18.308 --> 33:19.767
- What do you mean?
- What's going on?

33:19.850 --> 33:21.433
<i>Do you think
we're fucking idiots?</i>

33:21.517 --> 33:22.475
- Matthew, what is going on?
- Mom?

33:22.558 --> 33:23.683
Matthew, shh!

33:23.767 --> 33:25.808
- Mom? Dad?
- Matt, what is going on?

33:25.892 --> 33:29.183
Matthew, please.
Your mother said "be quiet."

33:29.267 --> 33:33.558
<i>Put Charley on.
Don't tell me he stepped out.</i>

33:39.392 --> 33:43.100
- Who's this?
- <i>I said put Charley on the phone.</i>

33:43.183 --> 33:46.267
Uh, he didn't show.

33:48.975 --> 33:50.600
Are we getting fucked here,
Jones?

33:50.683 --> 33:52.600
<i>Put the other one on.</i>

33:52.683 --> 33:55.267
<i>Put the other one on, now,
or I will go so far up the chain,</i>

33:55.350 --> 33:59.517
<i>you will find yourself in all 48
states at the same fucking time!</i>

34:01.267 --> 34:04.017
- What is it?
- <i>I said Charley.</i>

34:05.142 --> 34:06.808
He's indisposed, man.

34:06.892 --> 34:10.016
<i>All right. Listen to me carefully.
Fuck Charley.</i>

34:10.100 --> 34:11.558
<i>Kill Ronald and the others</i>

34:11.641 --> 34:13.350
<i>and meet me at the
Flame Show Bar in half an hour.</i>

34:13.433 --> 34:15.350
<i>You'll get your share
and theirs.</i>

34:15.433 --> 34:16.350
Got it.

34:26.016 --> 34:27.141
What'd you do?

34:28.350 --> 34:30.683
The safe was empty.

34:30.766 --> 34:32.475
Forbert must have taken
the document home.

34:32.558 --> 34:33.891
I had to put something
in the envelope.

34:33.975 --> 34:35.850
You put us at risk?

34:35.933 --> 34:37.933
- What was I supposed to do?
- What is wrong with you?

34:38.016 --> 34:39.683
Hey, hey, hey.
Shut up. Shut up!

34:41.266 --> 34:42.766
Keys. Give me your car keys.

34:42.850 --> 34:44.766
He said
leave them in the car.

34:47.183 --> 34:49.600
- No.
- Hey, hey, hey.

34:49.683 --> 34:51.391
Whoa, Ronald.

34:53.641 --> 34:56.558
Listen, you shot him.

34:56.641 --> 35:00.308
Okay, he broke in, you disarmed
him, and you shot him.

35:00.392 --> 35:02.683
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Here. Take it.

35:09.975 --> 35:11.850
Okay, let's go.

35:14.350 --> 35:17.017
Look, I'm gonna need you.

35:17.100 --> 35:18.808
And when I do,
I expect you to help me.

35:18.892 --> 35:21.225
Understand? Hey!
You understand?

35:21.308 --> 35:23.392
- Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.

35:37.350 --> 35:39.892
We need to find
someplace to stay tonight.

35:39.975 --> 35:41.433
<i>Charley knew the bagman.</i>

35:41.517 --> 35:44.975
He knew Jones.
You couldn't tell that?

35:45.058 --> 35:46.767
I got cash up front.

35:46.850 --> 35:50.142
Yeah, which they were gonna pick
right back up off your corpse.

35:50.225 --> 35:53.975
He told me to kill everybody in the house.
You, too, Ronald.

35:54.058 --> 36:01.100
Who told you to kill me? Jones?
On the phone? Or before?

36:01.183 --> 36:04.433
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.767
They see me?
They're Frank's guys.

36:13.933 --> 36:18.183
I know why Frank wants me dead.
Why's he want you dead?

36:18.267 --> 36:19.600
No fucking idea.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.225
Fuck Capelli.

36:22.308 --> 36:24.767
This thing
is bigger than Frank.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.558
I mean, think about it.

36:26.642 --> 36:30.350
They gonna give us $5,000 for
just three hours of babysitting?

36:30.433 --> 36:33.142
And the thing they want
is in a fucking safe at GM.

36:34.725 --> 36:36.850
Maybe this outfit
out of Chicago is real?

36:37.933 --> 36:39.642
Yeah.

36:39.725 --> 36:43.642
Try to kill me. Think you're the
only one that can make a move?

36:43.725 --> 36:47.892
Yeah, I can make a move, too. They can
consider this shit a market adjustment.

36:55.308 --> 36:57.100
- Excuse me, sir.
- You're excused.

37:14.892 --> 37:18.683
Wait. Wait. Jesus, Curt.

37:18.767 --> 37:21.433
Aldrick Watkins
or Frank Capelli?

37:21.517 --> 37:23.642
You can tell me the truth now.

37:23.725 --> 37:25.225
I don't know.

37:25.308 --> 37:27.433
Uh-huh. Get up.

37:30.725 --> 37:34.017
Goddamn, man.
I just got back to sleep.

37:34.100 --> 37:35.808
Get your big ass up.

37:42.683 --> 37:44.183
Who set me up, Jimmy?

37:48.225 --> 37:49.725
Go open that door right there.

37:54.392 --> 37:55.642
Turn around.

37:58.475 --> 38:03.933
Now back up. Back. Back.

38:04.017 --> 38:08.850
Back. Back, back, back, back.

38:08.933 --> 38:11.058
I got two kids now, Curtis,

38:11.142 --> 38:14.975
they threatened to...
to kill 'em both if I ain't fish you out.

38:15.058 --> 38:17.683
- Fish me, specifically, out? Who?
- I don't know.

38:17.767 --> 38:21.058
Jimmy, I will put a bullet in your
gut, flip you over this rail,

38:21.142 --> 38:22.683
and let you
bleed out down there.

38:22.767 --> 38:27.892
All I know is that a guy
called me a half an hour ago.

38:27.975 --> 38:32.058
Offering me $10,000
to turn you in.

38:32.142 --> 38:34.975
$15,000 for the white guy.

38:35.058 --> 38:36.308
Was it Jones?

38:36.392 --> 38:38.267
He wasn't white.

38:38.350 --> 38:44.433
He just said that Mr. Watkins would
appreciate it, on behalf of Mr. Capelli.

38:44.517 --> 38:46.100
Wait a minute. Wait.

38:46.183 --> 38:49.183
You're telling me that Capelli
hired Watkins to fish me out?

38:49.267 --> 38:52.683
I don't know. "Hired"? I don't know.
They got some type of arrangement.

38:52.767 --> 38:54.475
- Oh, they're working together now?
- I don't know.

38:54.558 --> 38:56.225
- That's bullshit, Jimmy!
- I don't know!

38:56.308 --> 38:59.725
You can throw me over this rail
and I still won't know.

38:59.808 --> 39:02.767
Sounds like the man of the
house, Matthew Wertz,

39:02.850 --> 39:05.308
says he surprised the intruder,
disarmed him, and shot.

39:05.392 --> 39:08.475
Okay. All right, thanks
for your time. We appreciate it. Okay.

39:39.808 --> 39:42.392
Mr. Wertz?
I'm Detective Joe Finney,

39:42.475 --> 39:44.058
Michigan State
Attorney General's office,

39:44.142 --> 39:45.725
Organized Crime Task Force.

39:45.808 --> 39:47.850
Organized Crime?

39:47.933 --> 39:52.850
Yeah. Uh, Detroit Police, uh,
got two phone calls.

39:52.933 --> 39:55.517
One from a friend,
Mrs. Atkinson,

39:55.600 --> 39:57.183
she said she was concerned.

39:57.267 --> 39:58.725
And then another from a neighbor,
said they heard loud noises.

39:58.808 --> 40:01.433
Organized Crime?
Like the mob?

40:01.517 --> 40:05.850
Well, I guess that's the
$64,000 question, isn't it?

40:05.933 --> 40:08.683
Yeah, her badgering was annoying
him, so he took her in to get her

40:08.767 --> 40:12.017
out of the way. He was only in
there a minute. Came back out.

40:12.100 --> 40:16.850
I had followed,
and so I was turning.

40:16.933 --> 40:21.392
Um, and then I kind of came up behind
him, sort of. Like here.

40:21.475 --> 40:23.183
All three shots then
from this angle?

40:23.267 --> 40:28.392
No, I moved to here and I
saw him reaching for his gun,

40:28.475 --> 40:30.850
and then I shot again twice
as he was falling.

40:32.433 --> 40:34.683
But you told me
you had his gun.

40:34.767 --> 40:36.350
How many were there?

40:36.433 --> 40:37.725
One of them.

40:37.808 --> 40:39.267
"Of them"?

40:39.350 --> 40:44.517
One person.
One person. Him.

40:44.600 --> 40:48.475
First, I didn't see anything.
I just heard a gunshot.

40:48.558 --> 40:50.350
I was in the playroom
for most of the time.

40:50.433 --> 40:52.392
Yeah,
"most of the time".

40:52.475 --> 40:55.392
When did you go
into the playroom?

40:55.475 --> 40:58.475
When my dad told me
to go in the playroom?

40:58.558 --> 41:00.600
Why did he tell you
to go in the playroom?

41:02.058 --> 41:03.433
I don't remember.

41:03.517 --> 41:06.517
I closed my eyes, honestly,
for the whole thing.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.392
I just couldn't believe
what was happening.

41:09.475 --> 41:12.808
- It's very scary.
- Yeah. So, I... I didn't see what...

41:12.892 --> 41:14.767
I mean, is there anything
you can think of?

41:14.850 --> 41:18.642
Any reason for this man to have
targeted you and your family?

41:20.767 --> 41:23.142
He doesn't like happiness?

41:35.058 --> 41:36.558
Can I have the keys?

41:41.558 --> 41:43.808
I'd like to listen
to the radio.

41:48.350 --> 41:50.308
Oh, my.

41:50.392 --> 41:51.392
Rudy.

41:52.642 --> 41:57.183
Uh, I only need a minute.
If you don't mind.

42:01.308 --> 42:02.558
Thank you.

42:05.392 --> 42:06.558
Clarisse home?

42:08.475 --> 42:11.600
Angel? You have a visitor.

42:11.683 --> 42:13.475
Okay. Just a minute.

42:16.475 --> 42:17.683
Been all right?

42:22.725 --> 42:26.100
So, uh, I hear they're flattening
the neighborhood all the way down

42:26.183 --> 42:29.558
to the cemetery. Pulling up
those trolley tracks too, huh?

42:29.642 --> 42:33.017
- Hmm.
- Yeah, "urban renewal."

42:33.100 --> 42:35.058
More like "Negro removal."

42:35.142 --> 42:37.433
Yeah, that's right.

42:41.933 --> 42:43.142
Hey, Clarisse.

42:43.975 --> 42:45.808
When'd you get out?

42:45.892 --> 42:48.850
Uh, day before yesterday.

42:48.933 --> 42:51.183
They said
it was overcrowded, so...

42:51.267 --> 42:55.558
- Well, Detroit.
- Detroit.

42:56.475 --> 42:58.433
How can we help you, Curtis?

42:58.517 --> 43:01.850
Uh, I believe she still
has my suitcase.

43:14.808 --> 43:17.058
Heard you knifed someone
day one.

43:18.475 --> 43:20.433
It wasn't like that.

43:20.517 --> 43:22.600
All them fellas was mad at me
when I went in there.

43:22.683 --> 43:26.808
Guy came at me with a knife. I had to
defend myself. Only way to survive.

43:28.725 --> 43:30.433
Well, guess it worked.

43:31.475 --> 43:32.683
Time being.

43:37.558 --> 43:40.225
So, what'd you do in there,
all that time?

43:42.475 --> 43:47.142
Thinking. You know.
Just... Just a lot of thinking.

43:51.392 --> 43:52.600
How long are you gonna...

43:52.683 --> 43:55.933
Oh, not long.
Today, tomorrow, maybe.

43:57.392 --> 43:59.933
- Where are you gonna go?
- Kansas City.

44:00.017 --> 44:02.392
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:02.475 --> 44:04.100
Oh.

44:04.183 --> 44:06.308
Man wants forty-seven-fifty
for it now.

44:06.392 --> 44:08.558
He build on it
or something?

44:08.642 --> 44:13.183
You'd think, right?
Nah, he just knows I want it.

44:17.350 --> 44:21.100
You know Aldrick Watkins is never
gonna let you outta here alive.

44:21.183 --> 44:24.058
I know. I know.
I'm working on that. Trust me.

44:37.767 --> 44:38.892
Thank you.

44:42.350 --> 44:43.350
Okay.

44:45.475 --> 44:46.892
Good luck, Curt.

44:53.892 --> 44:56.933
Curt. You're not
to come back here.

44:58.350 --> 44:59.683
I wouldn't think of it.

45:21.975 --> 45:24.558
Is that
what I think it is?

45:24.642 --> 45:26.392
It depends on
what you think it is.

45:26.475 --> 45:28.517
You'll, uh, let me know
if you need anything else?

45:28.600 --> 45:32.933
Oh, yeah. Don't you worry. I'll...
I'll definitely be in touch.

45:33.017 --> 45:33.933
Good.

45:42.767 --> 45:47.683
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it!

45:47.767 --> 45:50.392
- Yes?
- <i>Can you talk?</i>

45:50.475 --> 45:53.517
- Yes.
- <i>This is that call I promised.</i>

45:53.600 --> 45:56.808
<i>It stays between you and me.
Do I have your word?</i>

45:56.892 --> 45:59.892
- Yes.
- <i>Get the keys to your wife's car.</i>

45:59.975 --> 46:04.600
<i>Meet us at the auto shop on
Lafayette and Russell in 20 minutes.</i>

46:04.683 --> 46:08.058
<i>Alone, Matt. Now hang up.</i>

46:08.142 --> 46:09.558
- What did he say?
- What did they say?

46:09.642 --> 46:11.142
- What is happening?
- Pack a bag.

46:11.225 --> 46:13.225
- Pack a bag? Why?
- Pack a bag.

46:13.308 --> 46:15.058
Why do we need to pack a bag?
I don't want to go. Where are we going?

46:15.142 --> 46:16.892
Matthew! Matthew! I'm done
with your lip! All right?

46:16.975 --> 46:19.350
- Okay. Okay.
- Pack a bag! Jesus Christ!

46:23.808 --> 46:27.558
Okay. Thank you, Dawn.
Appreciate it.

46:46.308 --> 46:47.933
Here he comes.

46:48.017 --> 46:49.475
Hurry up. Come on.

46:52.767 --> 46:54.683
Get in the car. Hurry up.

46:56.808 --> 46:58.767
Where your boss live?

46:58.850 --> 47:00.767
Northern Ohio.
About an hour away.

47:00.850 --> 47:02.142
Well, that's where
we're headed then.

47:02.225 --> 47:03.808
Wait, wait, wait.
I can't promise anything.

47:03.892 --> 47:05.642
I'm not even sure
that he's home.

47:05.725 --> 47:07.767
Only outcome is that
we get that document. Okay?

47:36.558 --> 47:37.767
What are you doing?

47:37.850 --> 47:40.058
Making sure you don't do
something stupid.

47:46.100 --> 47:47.808
- Wait, I...
- I'm Matt Wertz.

47:47.892 --> 47:49.892
- Accounting. Well, payables.
- Ah, yes.

47:51.975 --> 47:54.017
Is there something I can do
for you, Mr. Wertz?

47:54.100 --> 47:56.600
I need to speak to Mr. Forbert,
please. These are, um...

47:56.683 --> 47:58.725
We work together.
It's, uh, it's urgent.

47:58.808 --> 48:01.350
Where is your husband?

48:01.433 --> 48:03.017
He's in his office.

48:03.100 --> 48:05.808
- Where is his office?
- It's upstairs. I know where.

48:05.892 --> 48:08.350
- All right. You got it?
- Yeah.

48:08.433 --> 48:11.933
Let's go inside. Let's go inside.
Let's go inside.

48:31.975 --> 48:33.100
Come in.

48:40.725 --> 48:42.350
Wertz?

48:48.392 --> 48:54.225
Hi, Mel. Hi.
Louise told me to come up.

48:55.308 --> 48:57.100
I've never done this.

48:57.183 --> 49:01.308
I've never, uh, I've never come to
you in this way, but I... I need...

49:01.392 --> 49:04.517
- I absolutely need...
- What?

49:04.600 --> 49:09.392
...to borrow whatever that
document was that was in your safe.

49:09.475 --> 49:11.225
Oh, well,
that's not possible.

49:11.308 --> 49:13.058
And why would you need that?

49:13.142 --> 49:17.642
Because the person that put it
together made some mistakes.

49:17.725 --> 49:20.017
And, uh, they...
I told him that I would

49:20.100 --> 49:23.350
sneak it back to him so that he could
come give you the revised version.

49:23.433 --> 49:27.100
Well... Uh,
I put it together. Myself.

49:27.183 --> 49:30.308
Not one other person at the
company even knows about it.

49:30.392 --> 49:32.225
Okay, that was a lie.

49:34.142 --> 49:35.725
That's how important it is,

49:36.517 --> 49:37.808
that I would lie to you.

49:37.892 --> 49:40.267
And that I would do
what I did at work,

49:40.350 --> 49:43.808
which I never would do
if it weren't that important.

49:43.892 --> 49:46.475
Okay, well,
you need to leave, Matt.

49:47.433 --> 49:49.433
I can't.

49:49.517 --> 49:51.392
I'm gonna slowly
reach for the phone.

49:51.475 --> 49:53.100
No, no, no.

49:53.183 --> 49:54.933
You need to go.

49:57.308 --> 49:59.600
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- I can't.

50:02.267 --> 50:04.017
Now,
what are you doing?

50:04.100 --> 50:07.975
This is me warning you that I'm
going to have to get physical.

50:08.058 --> 50:10.392
It is literally life or death
for me, sir.

50:10.475 --> 50:13.558
Look, do you know what will happen
to you if you keep going with this?

50:13.642 --> 50:15.808
I do. I'm sorry.

50:21.433 --> 50:22.850
I'm gonna punch you now, sir.

50:22.933 --> 50:24.225
What the fuck, Wertz?

50:24.308 --> 50:26.892
I'm punching you.
This is going to be a punch.

50:26.975 --> 50:30.308
I can't give it to you.
This is proprietary information.

50:30.392 --> 50:31.975
I'm sorry.

50:34.225 --> 50:36.308
I love my job, sir!

50:36.392 --> 50:38.850
I love my job and this is
how important this is

50:38.933 --> 50:41.183
that I'm willing to be fired.

50:41.267 --> 50:43.558
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

50:45.142 --> 50:49.100
Don't worry.
Nothing's gonna happen.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.808
We're gonna be
out of here in no time.

50:58.225 --> 51:00.475
Ma'am...

51:03.892 --> 51:05.600
It's been a long day.

51:08.933 --> 51:12.100
And I'm gonna have to put
this over you so I can relax.

51:12.183 --> 51:15.017
You understand? Thank you.

52:00.475 --> 52:01.433
Hey.

52:02.475 --> 52:04.308
We got it. We can go.

52:04.392 --> 52:07.392
Bye, Louise. Thank you. Sorry.

52:11.892 --> 52:13.142
You have a good time?

52:31.308 --> 52:33.642
Mel! Mel?

52:36.725 --> 52:40.558
What happened?
Oh, my God, Mel.

52:41.850 --> 52:42.933
I'm calling the police!

52:43.017 --> 52:44.308
- No.
- I'm calling the...

52:44.392 --> 52:48.975
No police! Please, hon, please.
No police.

52:49.058 --> 52:53.183
Wow. Though once we
had in that bar, Coogan's!

52:53.267 --> 52:56.767
Dawn, you remember that? When the
guy, the colored guy approached you

52:56.850 --> 52:59.308
and I got in the middle,
but I'm a big guy.

53:00.725 --> 53:02.892
He was
one of the small ones.

53:02.975 --> 53:05.392
But a guy with a gun?
That is...

53:05.475 --> 53:07.267
That is not what
I imagined old Matt would do.

53:07.350 --> 53:09.683
- Brian.
- What? It's not.

53:11.725 --> 53:16.225
I'm sorry, Mary, your husband surprised
me, that's all. In a good way.

53:16.308 --> 53:21.850
Often wondered, myself,
what I'd do, situation like that.

53:21.933 --> 53:23.767
Don't want to put that
to the test, though.

53:25.725 --> 53:28.308
- I'll be back for dinner.
- Oh, you are not leaving, Matt.

53:29.892 --> 53:33.350
Matt is Dad.
My name is Matthew.

53:58.100 --> 53:59.558
Matthew?

54:00.767 --> 54:03.017
Come here for a second.

54:03.100 --> 54:05.017
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna bite.

54:06.267 --> 54:09.600
You're not in trouble.
Nor is your dad.

54:13.267 --> 54:14.725
It's the men that put you
into this position

54:14.808 --> 54:16.767
that we're concerned about.
You understand?

54:20.142 --> 54:22.225
One day, you want,
you can come to my office,

54:22.308 --> 54:25.642
I'll show you diagrams
going back 20 years.

54:25.725 --> 54:29.808
All the way back to Italy,
believe it or not. Even Africa.

54:32.183 --> 54:33.892
For right now,

54:33.975 --> 54:36.142
you can help us fill this
picture in a little bit,

54:36.225 --> 54:40.558
just by answering a couple
few easy questions. Hmm?

54:40.642 --> 54:42.725
I already answered questions.

54:42.808 --> 54:48.267
Well, you did, but there's just this one
thing that keeps sticking in my head.

54:51.100 --> 54:55.058
You said that, uh,
that "one of them" held you at gunpoint.

54:55.142 --> 54:57.808
One of them. One of them.
One of who?

54:57.892 --> 54:59.600
No, I...
No, I said "him." He...

54:59.683 --> 55:04.975
Well, no, no, you changed it to
"him." You changed it. You know?

55:05.058 --> 55:09.725
But me, I'm more of a "go with your
first instinct" kind of guy. Right?

55:09.808 --> 55:13.142
So what I'm asking you,
Matthew...

55:13.225 --> 55:16.808
I'm asking if you can
remember any names...

55:18.017 --> 55:21.267
or any identifying
characteristics, at all?

55:23.433 --> 55:25.017
You know, Doug Jones?

55:26.683 --> 55:30.392
Frank Capelli?
Aldrick Watkins? Anything?

55:35.683 --> 55:37.100
Is my dad in trouble?

55:39.433 --> 55:40.475
Well...

55:42.558 --> 55:44.392
Honestly, Matthew, the...

55:46.017 --> 55:47.642
the only time
in my experience people

55:47.725 --> 55:50.142
get into trouble is when
they don't tell the truth.

55:56.767 --> 55:58.933
There were three of them.

55:59.017 --> 56:00.308
There were three of them.

56:02.142 --> 56:06.142
I'm sorry, Dawn. He's gonna do what
he's gonna do. I can't stop him.

56:06.225 --> 56:09.808
It's okay. It's okay.

56:12.142 --> 56:13.558
Poor thing.

56:15.892 --> 56:20.350
It's okay.
This is a really hard time.

56:20.433 --> 56:25.808
No, it's something else, and I can't...
I can't talk about it.

56:25.892 --> 56:29.058
You can talk to me about
anything. You know that.

56:32.933 --> 56:37.433
How do you do it?
Actually, how does anyone do it?

56:37.517 --> 56:39.850
- What do you mean?
- Just anything.

56:41.267 --> 56:45.058
All of it.
This, and this, and...

56:47.142 --> 56:48.350
It's impossible.

56:51.267 --> 56:56.933
I was thinking that maybe
we could go away somewhere?

56:59.142 --> 57:00.142
Who?

57:02.017 --> 57:05.308
Us. A trip.

57:05.392 --> 57:07.475
Together, somewhere.

57:14.017 --> 57:15.975
Good luck
explaining that one.

57:20.308 --> 57:22.100
So, is that
the real one, Matt?

57:25.058 --> 57:27.100
I just want this to be over.

57:29.142 --> 57:30.517
What is it?

57:32.183 --> 57:37.350
Some new exhaust system.
Like a muffler.

57:37.433 --> 57:39.350
Is that what it is, Matt?
It's a muffler?

57:41.350 --> 57:44.100
I don't know.
They don't tell me anything.

57:44.183 --> 57:47.017
I just push numbers around.

57:47.100 --> 57:48.933
You're pushing more
than numbers now, big guy.

57:49.017 --> 57:51.475
You got that right.

57:58.683 --> 57:59.850
All right.

58:01.642 --> 58:04.058
May I have
my car back, please?

58:05.392 --> 58:07.017
We like your car, Matt.

58:20.392 --> 58:22.642
<i>Dawn,
please just put her on.</i>

58:22.725 --> 58:23.933
<i>Not tonight.</i>

58:24.017 --> 58:26.517
Everything is so weird
right now.

58:26.600 --> 58:28.725
Oh, Paula Cole, Matt?

58:31.433 --> 58:34.225
Sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

58:34.308 --> 58:38.142
Dawn, please.
Just put her on.

58:38.225 --> 58:41.517
Matt, not tonight. I'm sorry.

58:44.475 --> 58:46.642
<i>Gee, what a beautiful room.</i>

58:57.225 --> 58:59.642
Do you have it?
Matt...

58:59.725 --> 59:02.433
Wait. Wait.

59:04.933 --> 59:07.017
- Matt...
- Wait. Just wait. Just wait.

59:07.100 --> 59:09.100
- You went to Forbert's?
- Yes.

59:09.183 --> 59:11.225
- And so you got it?
- Yes.

59:11.308 --> 59:13.642
- Okay, so you...
- Wait. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait.

59:13.725 --> 59:16.017
- Wait, wait, wait.
- So you have the document.

59:16.100 --> 59:20.933
Wait, wait, wait.
There's a conversation that I... that I...

59:22.017 --> 59:24.683
intended to have with you.

59:25.725 --> 59:28.142
That I've been...

59:28.225 --> 59:31.225
That I set aside time to
have, with you, two days ago.

59:32.142 --> 59:34.517
Okay.

59:34.600 --> 59:38.725
But if you remember
Peggy had that bird feeder...

59:39.892 --> 59:40.850
Anyway...

59:42.600 --> 59:46.308
the conversation that I intended
to have with you two days ago,

59:46.392 --> 59:49.142
I'd like to have with you now so that
you understand the chain of events

59:49.225 --> 59:52.100
that led to this moment,
where we are right here now.

59:52.183 --> 59:54.975
So this conversation
that I'd like to have now,

59:55.058 --> 59:57.850
which I recognize
at this point is conceptual...

59:57.933 --> 01:00:00.392
- Everything's...
- Matt, where is the document?

01:00:00.475 --> 01:00:01.683
Where is it?

01:00:04.558 --> 01:00:06.600
Did you even reach out to
Naismith in the first place?

01:00:06.683 --> 01:00:10.058
- Yes. Yes, I spoke to him a week ago.
- Okay, and what did you say?

01:00:10.142 --> 01:00:11.892
I... Let me finish.

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:15.142
I told him what you told me.
I said that a very important person

01:00:15.225 --> 01:00:17.808
at my company has a document
that involves the Big Four

01:00:17.892 --> 01:00:21.100
that I think your bosses at
Studebaker would be very interested...

01:00:21.183 --> 01:00:23.683
- You said that? You...
- Yes. Let me finish. Let me finish.

01:00:23.767 --> 01:00:25.892
And he agreed.
He agreed to buy it.

01:00:27.017 --> 01:00:30.433
Okay. And?

01:00:30.517 --> 01:00:35.058
Imagine this is two days ago
that I'm telling you this, okay?

01:00:35.142 --> 01:00:36.600
You never called him back.

01:00:36.683 --> 01:00:38.683
No. I did. I did.

01:00:38.767 --> 01:00:39.850
Oh.

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:44.392
But what I wanted
to tell you is that...

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:47.392
Mmm-hmm.
You chickened out. Mmm.

01:00:47.475 --> 01:00:48.808
No, I decided it was wrong.

01:00:48.892 --> 01:00:51.600
And so you chickened out.
Oh, God.

01:00:51.683 --> 01:00:55.100
No, it was a process.
A proc... A thought...

01:00:55.183 --> 01:00:57.600
- I did not just "chicken out."
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:00:57.683 --> 01:00:59.808
I contacted a realtor.

01:00:59.892 --> 01:01:01.975
I rented us a car
for when we got to California.

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.767
I didn't know
that you'd move so fast.

01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:07.058
- Oh, God.
- I didn't know Naismith would...

01:01:07.142 --> 01:01:10.433
Oh, my God,
you said "anyway".

01:01:10.517 --> 01:01:13.142
Back in the office,
you said,

01:01:13.225 --> 01:01:15.975
"He moved on it anyway" and I was
thinking, "Anyway what?"

01:01:16.058 --> 01:01:17.808
But now I know exactly
what "anyway what?" means,

01:01:17.892 --> 01:01:20.350
it means you chickened out
and Naismith

01:01:20.433 --> 01:01:22.975
knew about it
and he moved on it anyway,

01:01:23.058 --> 01:01:27.808
and now I am stuck in the
Humpty fucking Dumpty Motel

01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:30.100
with a guy who could
see the brass ring

01:01:30.183 --> 01:01:34.017
coming around the corner and
then literally watched it pass,

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.767
while he was making a plan
to grab that brass ring.

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:39.767
I was not making a plan.
I was executing a plan.

01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:41.100
To not do the thing.

01:01:41.183 --> 01:01:43.975
That I acknowledge
that we said we would do.

01:01:44.058 --> 01:01:46.350
- "Executing" how?
- Calling Naismith.

01:01:46.433 --> 01:01:48.392
And telling him we were out.

01:01:48.475 --> 01:01:51.725
Which is what I was gonna
tell you two days ago.

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:53.642
No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:53.725 --> 01:01:55.850
- And now...
- Here we are.

01:01:55.933 --> 01:01:58.100
Yeah. Here we are.

01:02:00.975 --> 01:02:03.308
I guess I'll call
the rental company.

01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:06.933
And, I guess I'll call Phil.

01:02:24.892 --> 01:02:26.392
It's all the way back.

01:02:38.475 --> 01:02:42.433
Hey, uh, can Jones
activate on his own?

01:02:44.975 --> 01:02:46.517
No idea what you mean.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.683
Can he call shots
is what I'm asking?

01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:55.183
Are you planning
to bring Frank in?

01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:58.100
I am considering it.

01:03:00.142 --> 01:03:01.892
How are you
gonna approach him?

01:03:03.808 --> 01:03:09.350
Well, from what I could
discern, you know his wife.

01:03:17.267 --> 01:03:19.892
So you want me to go
and knock on his door?

01:03:19.975 --> 01:03:22.142
He's not gonna
mess with you, Ronald.

01:03:22.225 --> 01:03:23.725
We got what he wants.

01:03:24.558 --> 01:03:26.017
All you need to do

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.808
is convince him to show up
at Cafe Roma with $50,000.

01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:30.433
- Fifty? Mmm.
- That's right.

01:03:30.517 --> 01:03:35.392
And we'll give him
the document. 25. 25.

01:03:35.475 --> 01:03:38.850
Now if he balks,
we'll know we hit near the ceiling.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.142
But if he bites,

01:03:41.225 --> 01:03:44.475
then we know there's a lot
more where that came from.

01:03:44.558 --> 01:03:47.600
You know, he's not gonna move a
hair unless he sees that thing.

01:03:51.767 --> 01:03:53.683
Yeah, you probably right
about that.

01:03:53.767 --> 01:03:54.892
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.142
Take it.

01:04:17.475 --> 01:04:19.017
Wow.

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.767
Take these, too.

01:04:40.017 --> 01:04:41.558
<i>Curt, man,
you've got to go.</i>

01:04:41.642 --> 01:04:43.267
<i>I just can't have
the scrutiny here.</i>

01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:45.183
<i>What scrutiny?</i>

01:04:45.267 --> 01:04:47.975
Man, we're talking about 12 hours tops.
I'm gonna be gone in the morning.

01:04:48.058 --> 01:04:50.767
- And they just raised the bounty.
- What?

01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:54.058
I'm talking 20 for you now.
25 for the white guy.

01:04:54.142 --> 01:04:58.017
Wait, you telling me that
the bounty is 45 for just us?

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:00.433
- That's what they told me.
- "They"?

01:05:00.517 --> 01:05:03.308
Both gangs.
Capelli and Watkins.

01:05:04.558 --> 01:05:06.517
Shit, I thought Jimmy
was just lying.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.183
No, man, that's what
I'm telling you, Curt,

01:05:08.267 --> 01:05:10.100
things are different
everywhere now, man.

01:05:10.183 --> 01:05:13.100
Okay, this bounty. Is it...
Is it dead or alive?

01:05:13.183 --> 01:05:15.683
The white dude, either.
But for you?

01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:18.933
Capelli wants you dead
and Watkins wants you alive.

01:05:20.892 --> 01:05:22.225
That's not good.

01:05:22.308 --> 01:05:24.392
And that's why I can't
have you here, man.

01:05:24.475 --> 01:05:26.725
I been on the up and up
since you went in.

01:05:26.808 --> 01:05:29.392
I haven't touched them
numbers in four years.

01:05:29.475 --> 01:05:30.725
I got a job now.

01:05:30.808 --> 01:05:31.933
I'm a bellman at the Gotham.

01:05:32.017 --> 01:05:33.267
I got a good girl.

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:35.017
And I don't wanna
have to lie to people,

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.808
but I also don't want people
in my shit here.

01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:40.475
All right. All right.
How much you make at the Gotham?

01:05:40.558 --> 01:05:42.892
It's good. $11 a day.

01:05:42.975 --> 01:05:48.933
Okay. Here's 200.
That is five times that for you tonight.

01:05:49.017 --> 01:05:51.475
Okay, and get me
a couple more guys.

01:05:51.558 --> 01:05:53.183
Uh, I'll give them
200 each, too.

01:05:53.267 --> 01:05:55.725
See if you can find
some of them Purple Gang boys

01:05:55.808 --> 01:05:58.142
unless the Italians done run
them out of town already.

01:05:58.225 --> 01:06:01.225
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I'm gonna get what's mine.

01:06:01.308 --> 01:06:02.850
And since when you...

01:06:02.933 --> 01:06:05.225
I don't need a fucking
lecture from you, Lonnie.

01:06:05.308 --> 01:06:08.183
You ain't got no goddamn idea
what's going on.

01:06:08.267 --> 01:06:11.183
Now, you gonna
do this shit or not?

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:15.392
All right. So you just make
sure you tell them to watch me

01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:18.433
and I'm gonna make a move or knock
over my glass and hit the deck.

01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:21.100
And when I hit the deck,
they go to work.

01:06:21.183 --> 01:06:25.267
I just got to ask you this, man.
Why the extra muscle?

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:28.100
In case the fellow I'm working
with is trying to sell me out.

01:06:28.183 --> 01:06:29.558
And how you gonna know this?

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:32.308
It's Ronald Russo.

01:06:33.683 --> 01:06:35.267
Frank, if you're not
gonna peel 'em,

01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:37.725
can you at least come
get the eyes out, please?

01:06:37.808 --> 01:06:39.683
You know how I feel
about the eyes.

01:06:42.183 --> 01:06:44.725
- Frank!
- Mmm-hmm.

01:06:46.017 --> 01:06:48.225
- Are you gonna get that?
- Yes!

01:07:07.642 --> 01:07:09.183
What do you want?

01:07:09.267 --> 01:07:12.100
- Hi, Frank.
- What do you want?

01:07:12.183 --> 01:07:13.933
We had a little slip up
at work.

01:07:15.058 --> 01:07:16.433
Well, we're about to eat.

01:07:17.392 --> 01:07:18.725
We'll be quick.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.642
And you must be Veronica.

01:07:36.808 --> 01:07:38.350
It's Vanessa.

01:07:39.183 --> 01:07:40.725
Oh, excuse me. Vanessa.

01:07:41.517 --> 01:07:42.558
Go upstairs.

01:07:52.767 --> 01:07:55.017
Gotham Hotel.
Twelve noon.

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:57.017
<i>And what if he says no?</i>

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.850
Well, sell it, god damn it.
He's got to go for it. It's gonna work,

01:08:00.933 --> 01:08:03.225
<i>but you got to tell him
the whole plan.</i>

01:08:03.308 --> 01:08:06.267
Okay. I'll tell the boss.

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:09.725
<i>Yeah, and also tell him that
he's got to show up in person.</i>

01:08:09.808 --> 01:08:11.892
He's got to.
That's the only way this works.

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.475
He says he can deliver
the code book

01:08:21.558 --> 01:08:23.642
and guarantee you 50,
maybe more.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:26.308
- A lot more.
- And what does he get?

01:08:26.392 --> 01:08:30.142
Safe passage.
And five grand for himself.

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:36.600
So the 50 isn't really 50,
it's 45.

01:08:36.683 --> 01:08:38.308
At that price,
ain't it worth more

01:08:38.392 --> 01:08:41.392
to just turn Goynes in
to Joe Finney?

01:08:41.475 --> 01:08:44.975
And that other guy,
what's his name? Russo?

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:50.808
That's more like
Capelli business.

01:08:50.892 --> 01:08:53.975
Either way, what you
want me to tell Goynes?

01:08:55.683 --> 01:08:57.308
Tell him...

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:03.350
I'll be there.
With pleasure.

01:09:04.433 --> 01:09:06.933
<i>A Cadillac convertible.</i>

01:09:07.017 --> 01:09:11.350
I was set up to die for the plans
for a Cadillac fucking convertible?

01:09:11.433 --> 01:09:14.767
It's what I heard,
that's all I know.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:18.392
See, Frank,
now I know you're lying.

01:09:18.475 --> 01:09:22.267
Because I happen to know it's
about some new exhaust system.

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:25.183
Well, maybe it's an exhaust
system for a Cadillac convertible.

01:09:25.267 --> 01:09:27.308
What fucking difference
does it make?

01:09:27.392 --> 01:09:31.058
We were hired to steal some car
shit, we stole some car shit.

01:09:31.142 --> 01:09:33.517
Why are you even here?
What do you want?

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.267
Because I have
a proposition for you.

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:40.267
Okay, I'm going in my pocket.

01:09:48.642 --> 01:09:53.683
But first, I need you to admit you
picked me for this babysitting job.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:57.600
Now, I'll admit I know
why you want me gone.

01:09:57.683 --> 01:09:59.725
Just like you know why
I want you gone.

01:09:59.808 --> 01:10:02.142
I never aced you for my job.

01:10:02.225 --> 01:10:04.308
I was in line,
and you know it.

01:10:04.392 --> 01:10:05.767
Well, you might've
been in line,

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:07.767
but you were walking
the wrong direction.

01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:10.683
It's never your fault, is it?
Is it?

01:10:10.767 --> 01:10:14.517
And since you're so sure about
why I apparently want you dead,

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.767
you might want to get yourself
checked for the clap.

01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:20.392
Consider it a gift
from me to you

01:10:20.475 --> 01:10:24.183
through my lovely
wife "Veronica."

01:10:24.267 --> 01:10:26.100
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:10:28.017 --> 01:10:30.683
She already told me.

01:10:30.767 --> 01:10:33.558
And I could kill you,
but I'd rather give you a trophy.

01:10:33.642 --> 01:10:35.183
You can have her.

01:10:35.267 --> 01:10:39.017
Frank. Frank, she's way
out of my league.

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.933
Okay.

01:10:41.017 --> 01:10:42.017
She's your wife.

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:44.642
Yeah. Exactly. Fine.

01:10:44.725 --> 01:10:48.475
Now that we've established
a line of open communication,

01:10:48.558 --> 01:10:51.433
okay, why don't you tell me
what your proposition is?

01:10:51.517 --> 01:10:54.600
Okay. Here's the deal.

01:11:02.433 --> 01:11:04.392
Where's the other half?

01:11:04.475 --> 01:11:06.642
Goynes wants 50 grand
for the whole thing.

01:11:06.725 --> 01:11:08.058
Fifty?

01:11:08.142 --> 01:11:10.600
Yeah,
but I got a plan.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:12.892
He thinks you'll think
it's a drop in the bucket

01:11:12.975 --> 01:11:15.808
just to keep whatever deal
you got going on track.

01:11:17.642 --> 01:11:19.058
But here's what I think.

01:11:21.642 --> 01:11:23.475
You call Jones off the case.

01:11:23.558 --> 01:11:26.517
We meet the moulinyan
at Cafe Roma, 08:30.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:30.600
He brings the other half.
We do the trade,

01:11:30.683 --> 01:11:34.392
then we dump Goynes,
and we split the cash.

01:11:34.475 --> 01:11:36.142
Split?

01:11:36.267 --> 01:11:39.767
Yeah. My 25 comes out
of the bounty,

01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:42.183
which I deserve because
I'm salvaging your deal

01:11:42.267 --> 01:11:44.392
and delivering the black guy.

01:11:44.475 --> 01:11:47.725
You ask me, he's worth more
than the whole thing.

01:11:49.058 --> 01:11:51.100
Why is that?

01:11:51.183 --> 01:11:54.767
Goynes has Watkins' code book
on him at all times.

01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:56.308
The code book.

01:11:56.392 --> 01:11:58.183
You ask me,

01:11:58.267 --> 01:12:00.517
he's running some
side game with it.

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:06.767
Then we're done.

01:12:09.683 --> 01:12:10.725
Well...

01:12:11.683 --> 01:12:13.267
Then, uh, okay,

01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:16.058
I heard you guys are
shorthanded in Reno.

01:12:16.142 --> 01:12:18.017
Maybe you send me out there.

01:12:20.558 --> 01:12:22.142
I would... I would like...

01:12:22.225 --> 01:12:25.267
Frank, I would like
something permanent.

01:12:27.308 --> 01:12:29.183
I can walk forward, Frank.

01:12:32.642 --> 01:12:33.767
Fuck!

01:12:35.267 --> 01:12:37.725
I just need a place
to start from. You know?

01:12:39.017 --> 01:12:41.517
Let's take care
of this first, okay?

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.600
Okay.

01:12:44.308 --> 01:12:45.350
Thank you, Frank.

01:12:51.558 --> 01:12:53.100
You are fucking him.
I was right.

01:12:53.183 --> 01:12:56.475
- What?
- He just confirmed it.

01:12:56.558 --> 01:12:58.017
Frank, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.100
I wouldn't... I don't...

01:12:59.183 --> 01:13:00.892
He just fucking admitted to it.

01:13:00.975 --> 01:13:04.600
Frank, I would never do that!
No, please, no! Please, please!

01:13:08.225 --> 01:13:10.683
You're fucking
kidding me.

01:13:10.767 --> 01:13:13.933
<i>He said Goynes keeps it
right by his chest. At all times.</i>

01:13:14.017 --> 01:13:15.517
What if there's
some bigger deal

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.183
that he's not letting on to?

01:13:17.267 --> 01:13:20.392
<i>It's a plan of Ronald Russo's.
How big a play could it be?</i>

01:13:22.808 --> 01:13:25.517
Hey, you think that Reno's
gonna put up with this

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.850
Ron fucking Russo's amateur-hour
fucking sloppy Russo bullshit?

01:13:30.933 --> 01:13:33.433
<i>Reno is never gonna
have to worry about it.</i>

01:13:33.517 --> 01:13:35.392
<i>You hearing me on this?</i>

01:13:35.475 --> 01:13:38.433
<i>Fuckin' Russo's blind greed,
he just gave us our own endgame.</i>

01:13:38.517 --> 01:13:41.100
<i>Drink your fucking bourbon
before the ice melts.</i>

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:08.392
You staying for dinner?

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.767
- Pour you some Chianti?
- Nah.

01:14:15.975 --> 01:14:18.767
Wine is good for you.
Ask Jesus.

01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:22.850
Yeah, well, so's a clear head.
Ask Pontius Pilate.

01:14:36.433 --> 01:14:37.975
Frank.

01:14:38.058 --> 01:14:40.725
Nice to see you again, Curtis.

01:14:40.808 --> 01:14:43.183
- You got the fifty?
- Yeah, right here.

01:14:43.267 --> 01:14:44.225
You got the two halves

01:14:44.308 --> 01:14:45.433
- of the document?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:14:45.517 --> 01:14:48.100
Let's dispense
with the bullshit.

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:49.767
We got the document.

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:51.975
You want it and it's yours.

01:14:52.058 --> 01:14:55.142
For a price.
But it's a new price.

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:59.017
What new price?

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.308
Twice the bounty
you getting for us.

01:15:02.433 --> 01:15:04.433
- Really? 90,000?
- That's right.

01:15:04.517 --> 01:15:06.142
- Ninety?
- Fifty, forty.

01:15:06.225 --> 01:15:09.017
- You're not serious?
- Yeah, I'm dead serious.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:14.142
Well, it's not my money,
so I'll of course have to get it approved.

01:15:14.225 --> 01:15:16.142
- From who?
- Who the fuck do you think?

01:15:16.225 --> 01:15:17.642
- The people that I need...
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:15:17.725 --> 01:15:19.392
...to get to
approve everything.

01:15:19.475 --> 01:15:21.475
- We're here now and we're gonna sell it.
- Hey, Ronald.

01:15:21.558 --> 01:15:23.142
- Hey, Ronald, how about you let me do this...
- We're gonna sell it

01:15:23.225 --> 01:15:24.850
- for the price we agreed...
- Hands on the table.

01:15:27.767 --> 01:15:29.808
Oh, Ronald.

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:32.142
It's not my fault.
Frank fucked us.

01:15:32.225 --> 01:15:34.725
You see, Ron, the problem is
you're not smart enough

01:15:34.808 --> 01:15:36.475
to know how not smart you are.

01:15:36.558 --> 01:15:39.725
Which makes you unpredictable.
Which makes you untrustworthy.

01:15:39.808 --> 01:15:41.475
And sloppy.

01:15:41.558 --> 01:15:44.392
- Sloppy?
- You fucking heard me.

01:15:44.475 --> 01:15:47.517
This whole fucking thing
is offensive. Let's go.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.975
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Where are we going?

01:15:50.058 --> 01:15:50.892
Get up!

01:15:50.975 --> 01:15:52.267
Where are we gonna go?

01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:53.767
Well, it ain't gonna
be no place good, Ronald.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:55.350
- Where are we gonna go?
- But, you, know...

01:15:55.433 --> 01:15:56.475
- Okay.
- ...sometimes things get sloppy.

01:16:07.933 --> 01:16:09.600
Oh, my lord.
Stay down. Stay down.

01:16:49.933 --> 01:16:52.850
Frank! Don't fucking move.
Don't fucking move.

01:16:52.933 --> 01:16:55.225
Get your ass against that car.

01:16:55.308 --> 01:16:57.558
Now who hired you?
Who sent you, Frank? Huh?

01:16:57.642 --> 01:16:59.433
Your motherfucking
pimp, that's who did.

01:16:59.517 --> 01:17:01.017
Your mother's mother fuck...

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.267
Ah, fuck.

01:17:03.642 --> 01:17:05.392
God damn it.
Who fucking hired you?

01:17:05.475 --> 01:17:06.767
Your mother's pusher.

01:17:08.433 --> 01:17:10.850
- Who hired you, Frank?
- It was her pusher, that's who.

01:17:12.183 --> 01:17:14.183
Dude, you gonna make me
ask you again?

01:17:14.267 --> 01:17:17.767
I offer you an olive branch
and you fuck me with it, huh?

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:20.017
Goynes. Goynes,
don't let him hit me.

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.725
Fuck you, Frank!

01:17:21.808 --> 01:17:24.100
- Fuck your Reno and your bullshit...
- He's the one who...

01:17:24.183 --> 01:17:26.642
Hey, hey!
For the last goddamn time,

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:28.767
who hired you to get
that fucking document?

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:31.142
Ow, ow, look, guys,
please don't, don't.

01:17:31.225 --> 01:17:32.933
I'll sit in the back.
I'll be fine.

01:17:33.017 --> 01:17:35.767
- Get your ass the fuck in there.
- Ow, watch the rib... Ow!

01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:37.933
Fuck! No, no, no.
I'm claustropho...

01:17:38.017 --> 01:17:39.392
Shut the fuck up.

01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:45.892
Hugh Naismith.

01:17:45.975 --> 01:17:48.100
<i>Yeah,
Mr. Naismith, um,</i>

01:17:48.183 --> 01:17:50.933
<i>I'm taking over your account
from Frank Capelli</i>

01:17:51.017 --> 01:17:53.642
<i>and I'm calling to arrange
for payment and delivery.</i>

01:17:53.725 --> 01:17:58.600
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
I'm sorry, who is this?

01:17:58.683 --> 01:18:02.683
Don't matter, uh,
we have the items that you've requested

01:18:02.767 --> 01:18:04.725
and I'm calling
to arrange payment.

01:18:04.808 --> 01:18:08.558
I don't know you.
They had me dealing with Frank.

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:10.850
<i>How do I know you
even have what I want?</i>

01:18:10.933 --> 01:18:12.517
<i>This is very irregular.</i>

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.350
Hang on. Hang on.

01:18:16.808 --> 01:18:17.725
Uh...

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:24.725
Okay, "compound consisting
of a mixture of propane

01:18:24.808 --> 01:18:26.392
and butane fractions containing

01:18:26.475 --> 01:18:29.517
<i>approximately 25%
of unsaturates</i>

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.642
<i>was fed to a catalytic mass</i>

01:18:31.725 --> 01:18:34.142
at a temperature of about 495."

01:18:34.267 --> 01:18:36.017
Do you want me to keep going
with this bullshit?

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:38.683
May I ask, how did you get it?

01:18:38.767 --> 01:18:40.433
A man named Mel Forbert.

01:18:40.517 --> 01:18:42.683
I can clear my morning.
When can we meet?

01:18:42.767 --> 01:18:45.267
Okay, and you're gonna
have the cash, right?

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:47.642
<i>One-twenty-five.
As arranged.</i>

01:18:47.725 --> 01:18:51.850
One... Yeah, one-twenty-five.
That's correct.

01:18:51.933 --> 01:18:54.225
<i>But it's the same deal with you</i>

01:18:54.308 --> 01:18:56.100
<i>that I had with Capelli
and Chicago.</i>

01:18:56.183 --> 01:18:58.933
Nobody at Studebaker,
or Studebaker-Packard,

01:18:59.017 --> 01:19:00.850
or anywhere knows about this.

01:19:00.933 --> 01:19:05.767
Yeah, of course.
Uh, so 12 noon. Gotham Hotel,

01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:07.142
you're meeting us
in the Holiday Room,

01:19:07.225 --> 01:19:08.433
but you wait down
there in the lobby,

01:19:08.517 --> 01:19:09.850
we'll come down
there for you.

01:19:17.017 --> 01:19:19.225
125,000?

01:19:19.308 --> 01:19:21.183
Yeah, that's what the man said.

01:19:21.267 --> 01:19:22.558
Well, shit.

01:19:25.683 --> 01:19:27.392
Where is the son of a bitch?

01:19:33.475 --> 01:19:35.558
He's going home.

01:19:35.642 --> 01:19:38.475
And when he gets home,
he's gonna call the cavalry.

01:19:38.558 --> 01:19:42.933
If he goes home,
he ain't calling anyone. Trust me.

01:19:44.892 --> 01:19:46.058
Fuck.

01:19:57.725 --> 01:20:00.600
Ow, fuck. Ow, fuck.

01:20:06.725 --> 01:20:10.308
Vane... Vanessa.

01:20:18.892 --> 01:20:21.808
What the fuck's going on?
What are you do...

01:20:21.892 --> 01:20:23.892
Vanessa, don't. Don't...

01:20:29.017 --> 01:20:31.350
Hey, Mom? Um...

01:20:39.558 --> 01:20:41.350
When I was walking earlier...

01:20:44.767 --> 01:20:46.683
the policeman, Finney...

01:20:49.392 --> 01:20:53.767
saw me, and... I...

01:20:56.767 --> 01:21:00.100
may have told him some things.

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.100
You mean, you told the truth.

01:21:07.017 --> 01:21:08.100
Sorry.

01:21:10.683 --> 01:21:14.600
No. No. It's not your fault.

01:21:19.017 --> 01:21:20.100
Okay?

01:21:21.975 --> 01:21:23.475
We all make choices.

01:21:25.392 --> 01:21:29.142
And your dad's gonna have to deal
with the consequences of his.

01:21:29.225 --> 01:21:31.933
But you did what you did,
and it was the right thing.

01:21:38.892 --> 01:21:39.892
What?

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:46.558
If we stop at Naismith,
we're selling ourselves short.

01:21:48.308 --> 01:21:50.475
Actually, I was thinking
the same thing.

01:21:53.433 --> 01:21:54.517
I was.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.183
All right, listen,
the point is,

01:21:57.267 --> 01:21:59.350
there's somebody above Naismith

01:21:59.433 --> 01:22:00.850
and there's somebody
above Forbert.

01:22:00.933 --> 01:22:03.267
And that's who we should
be dealing with.

01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:06.017
- So, what? Ditch Naismith?
- No.

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:08.517
- Ditch 125,000?
- No, no, no.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.933
- Come on.
- I'm not saying that.

01:22:10.017 --> 01:22:11.058
- That's crazy.
- No, no.

01:22:11.142 --> 01:22:12.600
We're not ditching nothing.

01:22:12.683 --> 01:22:16.100
We adding. Whoever they trying
to hide this thing from.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.225
Let's not get greedy, Goynes.

01:22:20.183 --> 01:22:21.433
I need more.

01:22:24.642 --> 01:22:26.392
Never satisfied, huh?

01:22:28.058 --> 01:22:30.558
All right. Forget it.
You don't want to partake,

01:22:30.642 --> 01:22:31.892
you definitely don't have to.

01:22:31.975 --> 01:22:33.600
That is not what I'm saying.

01:22:35.142 --> 01:22:39.392
It's fucking bold.
Fucking bold.

01:22:39.475 --> 01:22:41.808
<i>Okay, okay, okay.
Where, then?</i>

01:22:41.892 --> 01:22:44.767
<i>Anywhere. Sandusky.</i>

01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:48.183
Maybe Toledo. Maybe we
can move back to Detroit.

01:22:48.267 --> 01:22:49.600
Look, Louise, listen,

01:22:49.683 --> 01:22:51.933
I need you
to think about this rationally.

01:22:52.017 --> 01:22:54.975
There's no logical reason for
them ever to come back here.

01:22:55.058 --> 01:22:57.058
Look, they got
the thing they wanted.

01:22:57.142 --> 01:22:59.308
I literally have nothing
they need.

01:22:59.392 --> 01:23:00.642
Well, that's not exactly true.

01:23:03.308 --> 01:23:06.350
- Sir, we'd like to know actually...
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:23:06.433 --> 01:23:08.308
- We would like to know...
- Hey.

01:23:08.392 --> 01:23:09.975
Do... Do I know you?

01:23:13.683 --> 01:23:16.350
No idea what you're
talking about, buddy.

01:23:17.558 --> 01:23:19.475
Listen, who paid you?

01:23:19.558 --> 01:23:21.183
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:23:21.267 --> 01:23:25.600
Who paid you
to hide the document?

01:23:25.683 --> 01:23:27.850
<i>Mike Lowen's
office, how may I help you?</i>

01:23:27.933 --> 01:23:30.475
Yeah, it's Mel Forbert
for Mr. Lowen.

01:23:30.558 --> 01:23:32.475
Please tell him it's urgent.

01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:52.433
You cancel the rental car?

01:23:53.725 --> 01:23:55.225
What do you think, Matt?

01:23:57.517 --> 01:23:59.850
I think you did.
Of course you did.

01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:02.058
Uh-uh.

01:24:03.183 --> 01:24:04.683
Nope.

01:24:04.767 --> 01:24:07.142
- Really?
- Yeah, I kept the car.

01:24:07.267 --> 01:24:09.267
And the appointment
with the realtor.

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.558
You did?

01:24:13.642 --> 01:24:17.975
Paula? Paula, what about
the desk? Everything?

01:24:18.058 --> 01:24:21.225
Just the third drawer,
everything else can stay.

01:24:22.892 --> 01:24:25.892
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Phil.

01:24:30.725 --> 01:24:32.350
You're going...
You're going with Phil?

01:24:32.433 --> 01:24:38.850
Phil. You had a good idea.
California. So...

01:24:38.933 --> 01:24:41.975
Maybe one day we'll see you
and Mary out there.

01:25:04.558 --> 01:25:06.725
He was early.
And he came alone.

01:25:06.808 --> 01:25:08.892
- That's good.
- Confident man.

01:25:08.975 --> 01:25:10.892
Certainly gives
that impression.

01:25:48.017 --> 01:25:51.850
Mike Lowen.
Afternoon, Mike Lowen.

01:25:53.517 --> 01:25:55.142
You don't remember, do you?

01:26:00.225 --> 01:26:03.267
Staked out the liquor,
which is, counterintuitively,

01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:05.017
not entirely terrible.

01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.642
Pour you boys something?

01:26:06.725 --> 01:26:10.142
- Nothing for me.
- I'll trust you on that scotch.

01:26:10.225 --> 01:26:12.308
Excellent choice.

01:26:12.392 --> 01:26:14.183
You should have seen the look
on my face when my caddie

01:26:14.267 --> 01:26:16.683
came running
across that fairway.

01:26:16.767 --> 01:26:19.308
I never show up anywhere
on short notice,

01:26:19.392 --> 01:26:23.892
just ask my wife,
and yet here I am.

01:26:24.892 --> 01:26:27.850
Here we are. Congratulations.

01:26:32.933 --> 01:26:34.183
This moment...

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:39.100
stings like a motherfucker.

01:27:03.642 --> 01:27:05.808
Of course, we're gonna
have to count it.

01:27:08.142 --> 01:27:10.183
I'll do my arithmetics
right there.

01:27:15.975 --> 01:27:17.100
Excuse me.

01:27:41.975 --> 01:27:44.142
<i>So where'd we blow it?</i>

01:27:44.225 --> 01:27:47.058
<i>What's the, uh, what's the word
I'm looking for?</i>

01:27:47.142 --> 01:27:49.433
<i>The bridge between you and me?</i>

01:27:49.517 --> 01:27:51.725
<i>Who was it?
How did we get to this place?</i>

01:27:53.142 --> 01:27:55.725
What does any
of this matter right now?

01:27:55.808 --> 01:27:58.183
Well, I believe all truths
must be acknowledged,

01:27:58.267 --> 01:28:00.017
however painful they are,

01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.975
or else there's no growth.

01:28:02.058 --> 01:28:05.225
And growth is the key.
Growth! Progress!

01:28:05.308 --> 01:28:08.475
Of course there's no growth
without reach,

01:28:08.558 --> 01:28:13.683
and the risk being overreach.

01:28:13.767 --> 01:28:19.267
So what I want to know is where
was it my guys, my structure,

01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:22.808
my weak links, my overreach,

01:28:22.892 --> 01:28:26.350
and where was it
I was just simply outplayed?

01:28:26.433 --> 01:28:29.100
Well, all that
really matters is

01:28:29.183 --> 01:28:31.100
we're here, like you said,

01:28:31.183 --> 01:28:33.850
and, uh, we know everything.

01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:36.267
What do you know?

01:28:37.475 --> 01:28:39.142
If I may.

01:28:39.225 --> 01:28:41.642
I mean, it's a hefty bite and I
want to know what I'm paying for.

01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:51.142
Black Bottom. Paradise Valley.
You heard of 'em?

01:28:53.683 --> 01:28:56.267
You leveled
entire neighborhoods.

01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:57.767
You tore up the trolley tracks

01:28:57.850 --> 01:29:01.058
and now you got this redlining
bullshit everywhere.

01:29:01.142 --> 01:29:03.808
Where are people
supposed to live, Mike?

01:29:03.892 --> 01:29:06.933
The country is re-landscaping
itself, gentlemen.

01:29:07.017 --> 01:29:09.392
I hate to break it to you,
this is happening everywhere.

01:29:09.475 --> 01:29:12.058
A hundred cities and counting.
So again...

01:29:12.142 --> 01:29:14.058
- Yeah.
- What am I paying for?

01:29:14.142 --> 01:29:15.225
And you got no control.

01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:16.850
I did not
create the river,

01:29:16.933 --> 01:29:18.725
I am simply paddling the raft.

01:29:18.808 --> 01:29:19.933
Hmm.

01:29:20.017 --> 01:29:22.475
So again,
what am I paying for?

01:29:22.558 --> 01:29:25.933
Same thing you paid
Forbert for. Silence.

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:28.267
About?

01:29:30.058 --> 01:29:31.558
You know what about.

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.933
There is no conclusive evidence

01:29:37.017 --> 01:29:38.350
that the automobile
has anything to do

01:29:38.433 --> 01:29:40.142
with the pollution levels
in Los Angeles,

01:29:40.225 --> 01:29:42.808
or in any other city
on the planet for that matter.

01:29:42.892 --> 01:29:45.642
And the catalytic converter
will never be scaled to a size

01:29:45.725 --> 01:29:48.517
where it makes any sense
under the hood of any car.

01:29:51.517 --> 01:29:55.350
Ah. I'll get it.

01:29:57.975 --> 01:29:59.433
Tell him to sit tight.

01:30:07.475 --> 01:30:08.933
Yes.

01:30:09.017 --> 01:30:10.517
<i>Uh, this is Naismith.</i>

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.892
Sit tight, Hugh.

01:30:25.058 --> 01:30:26.225
<i>Quite a grab.</i>

01:30:27.975 --> 01:30:31.642
As long as we're talking about
overreach. I give Studebaker...

01:30:31.725 --> 01:30:35.183
No, sorry, "Studebaker-Packard"
a year, two tops,

01:30:35.267 --> 01:30:36.183
even with the merger.

01:30:38.558 --> 01:30:42.808
Fine, I'll address it to him.
Finally this makes sense.

01:30:45.142 --> 01:30:47.350
The clown, Naismith,

01:30:47.433 --> 01:30:50.225
somehow hears the Big Four
are working together.

01:30:50.308 --> 01:30:52.433
On what, he just has to know.

01:30:52.517 --> 01:30:54.892
Desperate to impress his bosses

01:30:54.975 --> 01:30:59.850
who know nothing of his plan,
he hires who he hires.

01:30:59.933 --> 01:31:01.267
They hire you.

01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:04.308
Somehow you sniff your way
to the head of the pack.

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:09.058
And hence, the twain has met.

01:31:09.142 --> 01:31:10.600
You and me.

01:31:10.683 --> 01:31:16.433
Against all laws of history,
nature, class...

01:31:16.517 --> 01:31:17.808
No, caste.

01:31:17.892 --> 01:31:20.850
All right. How we looking
on the count, Ronald?

01:31:22.933 --> 01:31:25.683
I count 375 even.

01:31:30.808 --> 01:31:34.767
I know you think we are
playing by "your" rules,

01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:39.058
but let's be clear,
you do not "make" the rules, ever,

01:31:39.142 --> 01:31:41.558
you follow them,
even when you think you have autonomy,

01:31:41.642 --> 01:31:43.725
even when you think you have
control, that is an illusion,

01:31:43.808 --> 01:31:47.392
you are under the illusion of
control, at all times, this is fact,

01:31:47.475 --> 01:31:48.975
it is a fact
you will never understand

01:31:49.058 --> 01:31:50.725
and you will go to the grave
not understanding,

01:31:50.808 --> 01:31:52.475
the same way I will
go to the grave

01:31:52.558 --> 01:31:54.767
not understanding the genius
of God's magnificent universe

01:31:54.850 --> 01:31:57.850
because I did not create it.
But I and others like me

01:31:57.933 --> 01:32:01.058
did create these rules,
in this world, on this field,

01:32:01.142 --> 01:32:02.642
and you are playing by them now

01:32:02.725 --> 01:32:06.017
even if you walk out of here
with my money.

01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:07.308
Am I clear?

01:32:07.392 --> 01:32:09.225
What is clear is that
we got your money.

01:32:09.308 --> 01:32:12.808
Ah, it's money.
I have a lot of money.

01:32:12.892 --> 01:32:14.642
I will continue
to have more still.

01:32:14.725 --> 01:32:17.183
It's like a lizard tail.
Cut it off,

01:32:17.267 --> 01:32:19.642
the damn thing just grows back.

01:32:19.725 --> 01:32:24.308
I work, it grows.
I sleep, it grows.

01:32:24.392 --> 01:32:28.058
In fact, however
we end up here,

01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:32.058
I'll go home,
I'll call my banker,

01:32:32.142 --> 01:32:34.392
and I will sleep
like a baby tonight.

01:32:39.725 --> 01:32:42.100
You still don't remember,
do you?

01:32:46.308 --> 01:32:48.767
Don't blame you,
it was years ago

01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:50.975
and I was one
of a panel of four.

01:32:51.058 --> 01:32:52.517
I was at Ford at the time.

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:55.183
We were trying to recruit you
just out of the service.

01:32:55.267 --> 01:32:58.058
Hard sell. I guess GM
made a better pitch.

01:32:58.142 --> 01:33:02.642
- Hmm.
- Okay, you got me.

01:33:02.725 --> 01:33:07.808
Yes, I remember you.
Michael Lowenstein. With the thing.

01:33:07.892 --> 01:33:11.892
Umlaut. Lowenstein.
I'm Swedish.

01:33:13.267 --> 01:33:16.517
The "stein,"
I found misperceived,

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.808
as you can imagine,
inhibited some of the traction

01:33:19.892 --> 01:33:21.392
I needed for our
overseas business

01:33:21.475 --> 01:33:22.808
the last few decades.

01:33:22.892 --> 01:33:24.975
And it wasn't entirely
helpful here, either.

01:33:25.892 --> 01:33:27.517
I'm sure you can understand.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.225
Oh, yes, "stein",
real drawback.

01:33:30.308 --> 01:33:33.225
Certainly you do, Mr. "Russo."

01:33:33.308 --> 01:33:35.600
All right, enough.
The money's here,

01:33:35.683 --> 01:33:38.267
we're leaving. You can too.

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.017
Then I shall get my hat.

01:33:50.267 --> 01:33:52.892
That was a watershed year
for me. That year.

01:33:52.975 --> 01:33:55.558
1928. I thought...

01:33:55.642 --> 01:33:57.767
we're losing guys to GM now?

01:33:57.850 --> 01:33:59.767
That same year,
they surpassed us in sales.

01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:03.225
We, who invented the whole damn
thing, became an underdog.

01:34:12.767 --> 01:34:15.100
Well, I left Ford
later that year.

01:34:15.183 --> 01:34:18.808
Decided I'd put my chips on
the industry as a whole.

01:34:18.892 --> 01:34:21.600
Smart. Individual companies,
to me?

01:34:21.683 --> 01:34:23.767
It's a distinction
without a difference.

01:34:34.308 --> 01:34:38.475
I remain agnostic as to how
they choose their pecking order.

01:34:38.558 --> 01:34:41.142
And I create some space for
them to spread their wings.

01:34:41.225 --> 01:34:42.142
It works well.

01:34:42.225 --> 01:34:43.850
So far.

01:34:43.933 --> 01:34:45.558
There's a mutual trust.

01:34:45.642 --> 01:34:47.475
I believe you have
something of mine.

01:35:03.808 --> 01:35:05.350
He's got the other half.

01:35:29.767 --> 01:35:32.183
Mutual trust.

01:35:32.267 --> 01:35:35.683
You know what I love? When characters
you've long since forgotten

01:35:35.767 --> 01:35:37.850
in this great novel called Life
show up at the end

01:35:37.933 --> 01:35:40.433
and the whole story
gets filled right in.

01:35:40.517 --> 01:35:42.642
Good to meet you both.
Individualists.

01:35:42.725 --> 01:35:45.142
Defiers of rules.
Two men who, against all odds,

01:35:45.225 --> 01:35:46.850
somehow arrived
in the same spot,

01:35:46.933 --> 01:35:49.683
from entirely different places.
Reach, gentlemen.

01:35:50.517 --> 01:35:51.808
Reach for the moon!

01:36:02.183 --> 01:36:03.558
So GM, huh?

01:36:05.017 --> 01:36:06.767
That was a long time ago.

01:36:16.058 --> 01:36:18.933
Good. Now let's go
get that Naismith money.

01:36:19.017 --> 01:36:22.392
Oh, no.
This is as far as I go.

01:36:22.475 --> 01:36:24.058
What do you mean, "Oh, no"?

01:36:24.142 --> 01:36:27.100
I'm done. You can have the
Naismith money all to yourself.

01:36:27.183 --> 01:36:29.100
So you're just gonna
abandon the plan?

01:36:31.183 --> 01:36:33.183
You just don't know
when to stop, huh?

01:37:00.683 --> 01:37:01.975
It's the bellhop.

01:37:03.517 --> 01:37:05.683
- Lonnie?
- Yeah.

01:37:05.767 --> 01:37:06.808
Let him in.

01:37:16.433 --> 01:37:17.558
Sorry, Ronald.

01:37:34.142 --> 01:37:35.308
Aldrick.

01:37:36.058 --> 01:37:37.600
Curtis.

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.183
What's... What's going on, man?

01:37:54.433 --> 01:37:57.642
- Aldrick, it's all right there.
- Let's go.

01:37:59.975 --> 01:38:01.475
I'm sorry, man.

01:38:02.683 --> 01:38:05.017
Aldrick.

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.100
Aldrick, I put this whole thing
together for you, man.

01:38:07.183 --> 01:38:08.683
You're not gonna
take that money?

01:38:08.767 --> 01:38:14.225
That money is too expensive.
I got what I want.

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.475
So? How'd it go?

01:38:44.892 --> 01:38:48.767
It broke my way, baby.
It broke my way.

01:38:51.308 --> 01:38:53.808
Oh, look at those. Ronald!

01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:58.808
There's more?

01:39:03.058 --> 01:39:04.350
How much is this?

01:39:05.642 --> 01:39:07.350
375, baby.

01:39:08.683 --> 01:39:10.308
375?

01:39:10.392 --> 01:39:11.475
Yeah.

01:39:12.975 --> 01:39:15.142
I have 31. That's...

01:39:15.225 --> 01:39:19.225
That's $406,000.

01:39:19.308 --> 01:39:21.808
Ronald, I can't believe it.

01:39:21.892 --> 01:39:26.433
How did you... How did
you manage this? I can't...

01:39:26.517 --> 01:39:30.017
Oh, my gosh, Ronald, baby.

01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:32.392
Oh, my goodness.
We could do anything.

01:39:32.475 --> 01:39:35.142
We could go anywhere.
Around the world.

01:39:35.225 --> 01:39:38.225
Oh, we could even take
an airplane, Ronald.

01:39:38.308 --> 01:39:43.225
We could take ten airplanes if
we wanted to. I mean, I just...

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.683
You did it.

01:39:47.767 --> 01:39:50.267
We're not there yet. Here.

01:40:07.517 --> 01:40:10.308
- Where's the car?
- Spot 5.

01:40:10.392 --> 01:40:13.642
Okay, get it and wait for me
at the entrance.

01:40:13.725 --> 01:40:14.975
Okay.

01:40:15.058 --> 01:40:17.100
No, no, no. I got that one.

01:40:17.183 --> 01:40:18.392
Okay.

01:40:20.267 --> 01:40:21.808
I'll be right behind you.

01:40:45.725 --> 01:40:49.267
- Aldrick.
- Hello, Joe.

01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:51.017
Chatty little bird
in a tall tree

01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:53.058
said you might have
something of mine.

01:40:53.142 --> 01:40:57.975
So, I suppose
I should thank you.

01:40:58.058 --> 01:41:02.725
Before you do, let me
play out two scenarios.

01:41:02.808 --> 01:41:05.600
And to be clear,
both end with

01:41:05.683 --> 01:41:07.892
Curtis Goynes dead.

01:41:07.975 --> 01:41:14.142
Scenario one, you solve
the murder of Charley Barnes,

01:41:15.433 --> 01:41:19.433
Douglas Jones,
and Frank Capelli.

01:41:19.517 --> 01:41:22.725
After an arduous trial
that plunges an already

01:41:22.808 --> 01:41:26.725
racially-divided Detroit
into chaos,

01:41:26.808 --> 01:41:28.517
you get a promotion of

01:41:29.433 --> 01:41:33.892
a thousand a year? If that?

01:41:33.975 --> 01:41:38.475
And I make sure
Goynes dies in prison.

01:41:38.558 --> 01:41:42.642
Or number two.
You still solve the murders,

01:41:42.725 --> 01:41:45.058
but the perp himself

01:41:45.975 --> 01:41:49.892
is taken care of by his own.

01:41:49.975 --> 01:41:51.892
Which leaves you a hero

01:41:51.975 --> 01:41:55.392
and which sets an example
to others like him

01:41:55.475 --> 01:42:00.142
that might be tempted to
play outside of their league.

01:42:01.558 --> 01:42:07.142
And instead of 25 grand

01:42:07.225 --> 01:42:09.475
that trickles out over
the rest of your life,

01:42:09.558 --> 01:42:12.725
you get a bonus,
paid instantly,

01:42:12.808 --> 01:42:14.850
that equals twice that.

01:42:39.850 --> 01:42:41.767
<i>No runs,
two hits for the Senators.</i>

01:42:41.850 --> 01:42:43.725
<i>No runs, no hits for Detroit.</i>

01:42:43.808 --> 01:42:46.683
<i>Beautiful day here
at Briggs Stadium.</i>

01:42:46.767 --> 01:42:49.433
<i>Couple of scattered clouds
out there.</i>

01:42:49.517 --> 01:42:52.600
<i>But all in all, a gorgeous day,
and why not play two, and we will,</i>

01:42:52.683 --> 01:42:55.808
<i>a double header
scheduled today.</i>

01:42:55.892 --> 01:42:59.100
<i>As the first one from Schmitz
misses outside.</i>

01:42:59.183 --> 01:43:01.475
<i>One ball and no strikes,</i>

01:43:01.558 --> 01:43:04.933
<i>didn't quite connect there
with his receiver.</i>

01:43:12.808 --> 01:43:14.475
Finally!

01:43:14.558 --> 01:43:19.517
Can you believe it's 45 cents
to park with no grace period?

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:23.058
- Did you bring a map?
- It's in the glove compartment.

01:43:23.142 --> 01:43:24.642
That's my girl.

01:43:27.892 --> 01:43:28.975
You know,
you're not the only one

01:43:29.058 --> 01:43:31.350
that can think ahead, Ronald.

01:43:31.433 --> 01:43:34.517
- Change of plans.
- Oh, yeah?

01:43:37.683 --> 01:43:41.433
Yeah,
we're gonna go far.

01:44:05.475 --> 01:44:07.850
Take this turn off right here.

01:44:44.392 --> 01:44:45.683
Keep it running.

01:44:47.392 --> 01:44:51.725
Ronald, would you relax?
Nobody followed us out here.

01:44:51.808 --> 01:44:54.808
Look at us,
in the middle of nowhere.

01:44:58.433 --> 01:45:02.558
It's your favorite!
Come on, open it.

01:45:04.725 --> 01:45:06.433
Just open it.

01:45:07.933 --> 01:45:09.308
- Nice.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.142
Okay.

01:45:37.475 --> 01:45:39.933
- Oh, shit.
- Bye, Ronald.

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:07.933
Oh, fuck me.

01:46:33.475 --> 01:46:36.267
- Officer?
- Could you step out of the car, please?

01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:38.683
Well, may I ask
what this is about?

01:46:38.767 --> 01:46:40.392
Please step out of the car.

01:46:40.475 --> 01:46:42.183
Well, I think I have a right to
know why you're asking me...

01:46:42.267 --> 01:46:43.517
Stand over here.

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:56.850
Safe travels, Mrs. Capelli.

01:47:22.933 --> 01:47:28.267
Oh, hey. Come in, I guess.
We're eating.

01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:29.308
Thank you.

01:47:34.183 --> 01:47:35.225
I'll get Mary.

01:47:39.975 --> 01:47:41.017
Matt's here.

01:48:19.017 --> 01:48:20.767
Jesus, Matt.

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.558
My God, it's only Tuesday.

01:48:56.558 --> 01:48:58.183
Officer Finney.

01:49:01.308 --> 01:49:03.058
Right this way.

01:49:11.017 --> 01:49:12.892
I believe I have
something of yours.

01:49:16.642 --> 01:49:18.308
It's all there.

01:49:18.392 --> 01:49:21.558
Uh, you'd said $375,000 but I
think you made a little mistake.

01:49:21.642 --> 01:49:24.725
The actual number
is 406 and change.

01:49:26.808 --> 01:49:28.100
I must've miscounted.

01:49:28.183 --> 01:49:33.308
Oh, and, uh, this 50,000
presented itself as well.

01:49:37.475 --> 01:49:41.017
Hmm. Well, I wish
I could cut you in...

01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:43.433
Hey, it's your money.

01:49:43.517 --> 01:49:44.975
Right. Of course.

01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.725
Listen, uh, pick one
of those bottles there.

01:49:50.808 --> 01:49:53.642
Uh, that one on the left
is pretty good.

01:49:53.725 --> 01:49:55.683
And that's $88 wholesale.

01:50:05.392 --> 01:50:07.975
Well, you let me know if there's
anything I can do for you in the future.

01:50:08.058 --> 01:50:09.100
Of course.

01:50:10.475 --> 01:50:12.392
- Thanks, Joe.
- Uh-huh.

01:50:46.058 --> 01:50:51.767
Motherfucker's got eyes,
they just can't see.

01:50:52.642 --> 01:50:54.100
Including me.

01:50:55.975 --> 01:50:58.058
Let me
ask you something.

01:51:05.308 --> 01:51:09.308
What made you think
that you could trust me?

01:51:12.975 --> 01:51:14.933
You can be trusted, Aldrick.

01:51:28.725 --> 01:51:34.017
I took the 25 I staked
you back then, plus interest.

01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:36.892
Took another 50
for the federal man.

01:51:38.558 --> 01:51:41.933
How do you imagine the rest
of it should be divided?

01:51:43.558 --> 01:51:45.100
I just want 5k.

01:51:47.017 --> 01:51:48.017
Just what's yours.

01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.933
Just what's mine.

01:52:11.475 --> 01:52:12.642
So we're good?

01:52:16.642 --> 01:52:19.183
Enjoy Kansas City.
