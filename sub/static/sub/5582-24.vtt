WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:03.171
Previously on
NCIS: New Orleans...

00:03.204 --> 00:04.738
Agent Brody.
Agent Russo.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.574
Helping to set up
the new DHS post.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.709
Something imminent?
No, no. Usual chatter.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.611
Mrs. Judy Brown?
Yes?

00:10.644 --> 00:12.180
SONJA:
Gun!

00:12.213 --> 00:13.714
Arthur, run!
RUSSO: Two foreign operatives,

00:13.747 --> 00:15.716
I promise you,
all bets are off.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.357
This red means HMX.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.059
So they were
smuggling in explosives.

00:25.093 --> 00:27.161
Explosive power
to level a city block.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.829
You jeopardized the mission.

00:28.862 --> 00:32.633
Wait you're... our contact.

00:32.666 --> 00:35.369
You know what you have to do.

00:47.615 --> 00:51.385
*

01:36.664 --> 01:38.599
Yes.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.401
Is the package complete?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.670
Secured and ready
for delivery, yes.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.175
Wait. No! No, no, no...!

02:05.659 --> 02:07.495
What were you doing out there?

02:07.528 --> 02:10.698
Just taking in the view.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.467
But this view's better.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.143
Your phone has been
ringing off the hook.

02:26.414 --> 02:27.915
It's the office.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.218
Guess I better answer.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.593
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:39.627 --> 02:42.296
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:42.330 --> 02:44.698
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:44.732 --> 02:45.933
* How, how, how, how

02:45.966 --> 02:48.436
* Hey, hey

02:54.308 --> 02:55.609
* You gotta come on.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.479
PRIDE:
Mornin', you two.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.680
Stopped by the lumberyard.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.482
Thank you.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.684
Picked up some wood to
cover up the doors and windows

03:03.717 --> 03:04.885
till the glass people come.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.886
LASALLE:
I got you, King.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.888
Thank you.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.490
Just saw Roy at the hospital.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.658
He's getting released today.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.260
Well, he should
get a medal too.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.495
He's a brave man, taking a
bullet for Merri like that

03:14.528 --> 03:15.696
when this place got attacked.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.897
Agreed.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.267
Uh, you hire a new bar manager

03:19.300 --> 03:21.702
just in time to become
"Mr. Fix-it" at work.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.573
Someone invaded our home.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.207
Now, we can't
leave it like this.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.378
Brody back?
I haven't seen her.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.313
She's supposed to be
interviewing Judy Brown.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.382
Figure out why her
husband did all this.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.451
Yeah, and figure out the
location of the HMX explosives

03:37.485 --> 03:38.652
they smuggled in the city.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.331
PRIDE:
Blast went off at 7:00 am.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.866
ATF contacted us
when they determined

03:52.900 --> 03:54.802
it was high explosives.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.538
Know we've been on the lookout.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.739
Casualties?

03:58.772 --> 04:00.541
Pieces of one.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.743
PRIDE:
Place is just used for storage.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.945
Not exactly a high value target.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.347
SONJA:
It wasn't a target,

04:06.380 --> 04:07.581
it's a workshop.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.049
Yeah, I've been going
through the debris.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.520
Found remnants of wiring,
plastic casing, old batteries.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.824
All classic components
in bomb-making.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.459
Now, best guess:

04:18.492 --> 04:20.294
radio-controlled IED

04:20.328 --> 04:22.496
with some sort of
cellular frequency.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.864
How do you know
so much about it?

04:23.897 --> 04:27.067
Before undercover,
ATF trained me as a CES,

04:27.100 --> 04:29.603
Certified Explosives Specialist.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.306
I know what it stands for,
I'm just surprised you're one.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.642
Well, you're not the only one
with secret skills, scuba boy.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.510
PRIDE: If this was
a bomb-making workshop,

04:36.544 --> 04:38.011
what happened?

04:38.045 --> 04:39.880
Could be
an accidental detonation.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.383
It's an occupational hazard
in the bomb biz.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.419
But I won't know till
I get all this on the table.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.455
Stealing Ms. Loretta's
catchphrase.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.357
Well, Doc Wade is gonna need
all her skills

04:49.390 --> 04:51.492
to identify what's left
of this victim.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.427
Was the cause
of the blast the HMX

04:53.461 --> 04:55.329
we've been hunting?
Well, you know,
judging by the levels

04:55.363 --> 04:57.064
of nitrogen and carbon
that I've detected,

04:57.097 --> 04:59.400
I'd say it's a safe bet, yeah.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.868
Well, it could be good luck.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.870
Judy and Arthur Brown
smuggled the explosives in

05:02.903 --> 05:04.905
to someone planning an attack
on New Orleans.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.740
He takes himself out.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.643
Yeah, but HMX is one of the more
powerful chemical explosives.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.779
The damage here was done by...

05:11.812 --> 05:13.747
I don't know,
20, maybe 30 pounds.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.750
So there could be close to 1,000
pounds still unaccounted for.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.519
Enough to take out a skyscraper.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.020
Our only link is Judy Brown.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.722
Brody.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.624
Where are you?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.058
What?

05:25.092 --> 05:28.529
(Brody speaking
indistinctly)

05:29.797 --> 05:31.365
Judy Brown is dead.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.468
How?

05:34.502 --> 05:36.870
Cyanide poisoning.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.507
According to Wade,
Judy Brown ingested it.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.908
She was searched at NCIS

05:40.941 --> 05:43.611
and again when she
was processed at DHS.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.878
How'd she get the poison?

05:44.912 --> 05:46.914
Got a list of everyone
who had access to her

05:46.947 --> 05:48.081
in the last 12 hours,

05:48.115 --> 05:50.083
which, of course, includes me.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.652
Didn't notice
anything suspicious.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.654
She would've died within
minutes of ingestion.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.023
Which was 7:00 this morning.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.057
I have an alibi.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.827
LASALLE:
We got something.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.530
Pulled traffic and surveillance
cams around the warehouse.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.864
Damn.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.633
I'll put it up
on the other one.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.970
SONJA: So the truck pulled up
to our crime scene

06:10.003 --> 06:11.639
at about 4:00 in the morning.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.507
Left minutes before
the explosion,

06:13.541 --> 06:15.609
got abandoned on Tchoupitoulas.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.144
LASALLE:
ATF found traces of HMX,

06:17.177 --> 06:18.812
but nothing else.

06:18.846 --> 06:19.913
Who are they?

06:19.947 --> 06:21.715
Well, we don't know yet.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.453
South African nationals.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.723
Use your computer?

06:31.459 --> 06:33.594
They've got military training.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.864
They entered the country
with three others,

06:36.897 --> 06:39.867
all in the last month...
all in New Orleans.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.035
You knew about these men
and didn't tell us?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.972
I told you: Homeland's been
monitoring an imminent attack.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.541
You said it was
just "general chatter."

06:47.575 --> 06:49.877
We all found out yesterday

06:49.910 --> 06:52.680
that Arthur and Judy Brown

06:52.713 --> 06:54.014
have been taking
orders from someone

06:54.047 --> 06:55.616
through encrypted e-mails.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.185
And then there was the
assault on our office.

06:58.218 --> 07:01.188
That would've been another
time to mention these suspects.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.592
We've been watching these guys,
Pride, for weeks.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.060
No suspicious phone calls,
e-mails, or movements.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.862
None of these guys
is the ring leader.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.732
They take orders.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.901
So you have their location.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.605
They're staying at a house
on the Westbank.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.939
Homeland Security Investigations

07:18.972 --> 07:20.674
is gearing up to
take them down now.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.009
We need to be a
part of that raid.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.077
We need zone
coverage here, Pride.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.680
Let DHS handle the raid.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.215
You keep on this
morning's explosion--

07:28.248 --> 07:30.117
it doubles our chances of
finding this ring leader,

07:30.150 --> 07:31.885
and stopping the plot.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.889
I want to know the minute
those men are in custody.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.892
You'll be my first call.

07:43.196 --> 07:46.734
That's a big piece of intel
he's kept hidden from us.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.068
That's not all he's hidden.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.638
What do you mean?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.508
I can't believe
I'm thinking this.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.209
What, Merri?

07:57.277 --> 07:59.780
Russo may be the ring leader.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.128
This may seem insane, Pride,
but there have been

08:15.162 --> 08:18.198
three mysterious suicides
in as many cases.

08:20.033 --> 08:20.934
Walt Jeffries,

08:20.968 --> 08:22.636
Glenn Franklin,

08:22.670 --> 08:24.838
both tied to the scandal that
took down General Matthews.

08:24.872 --> 08:28.208
Judy Brown smuggled HMX
explosives into New Orleans.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.643
You think they connect?

08:29.677 --> 08:30.944
I don't know, only Russo's been

08:30.978 --> 08:32.813
a key player in all three cases.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.714
So are we.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.549
Yeah, but he's been
feeding us intel.

08:35.583 --> 08:38.218
Ever since DC, he's always there
with some tidbit.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.820
Always leads to a dead body.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.656
This morning, 7:00 a.m.,

08:42.690 --> 08:44.057
when the bomb went off,

08:44.091 --> 08:46.326
Russo was on his balcony,
talking on a cell phone.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.561
You were with him?

08:47.595 --> 08:49.697
Yes.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.065
And his cell phone was on the
kitchen counter the whole time.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.266
So he's got two phones.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.202
I mean, that could mean
a lot of things.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.639
Something inside me has been
saying "watch out."

08:58.672 --> 09:01.809
Same voice that told you your
sister's death was suspicious?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.114
I'm inclined to listen.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.984
Saying a high-ranking
Homeland Security agent

09:11.018 --> 09:13.153
is involved in
a terrorist plot...

09:13.186 --> 09:14.354
Why?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.089
Don't know.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.325
But if it's true,
he is the lead investigator

09:18.358 --> 09:21.795
in his own conspiracy,
and he has been playing us all.

09:21.829 --> 09:22.930
And we need evidence.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.665
Just can't go to his bosses

09:24.698 --> 09:27.134
at DHS... on instincts.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.736
I'll get the evidence.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.170
He trusts me.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.371
Thinks he has me fooled.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.873
Whoa, like undercover?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.141
Yeah.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.676
That's a bad idea.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.745
You don't know how
dangerous this guy is.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.380
Plus... you're
personally involved.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.083
That's why it has to be me.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.852
Look, if I'm right,

09:44.885 --> 09:46.253
he has put this city in danger;

09:46.286 --> 09:48.355
he's compromised
other Federal operations;

09:48.388 --> 09:49.923
it's a risk we have to take.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.291
Not we, you.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.860
On his turf.

09:52.893 --> 09:56.797
Okay, so I will stick
close to him at DHS,

09:56.830 --> 09:58.265
where there are 30 other agents.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.800
I'll never be alone with him.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.334
I know it's not perfect,

10:01.368 --> 10:03.336
but it's the best choice
we have.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.739
Okay.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.875
But only to observe, understood?

10:09.977 --> 10:12.012
Get Patton to dig into Russo.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.313
Find any red flags,

10:13.346 --> 10:15.816
any connections
to those missing explosives.

10:15.849 --> 10:16.917
And, hey...

10:16.950 --> 10:18.251
it's off the books.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.753
Till we know more.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.388
Just a theory.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.923
LASALLE:
You got it.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.392
WADE:
I knew there was something

10:25.425 --> 10:26.827
off with Merri this morning.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.029
Of course, Russo was there.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.731
PRIDE:
Mm.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.333
She seems to think he's
been corrupted somehow.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.902
And may be right.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.070
I spoke to a friend
in Homeland IG's office.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.205
Been aware of a breach
for a while.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.239
Breach?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.809
They've had intel compromised,

10:41.842 --> 10:43.410
operations blown.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.378
Have a task force to find
the breach, no suspect.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.780
WADE:
You mention Russo's name?

10:46.814 --> 10:47.981
Ah, not yet.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.382
Don't have enough proof.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.451
Mm-hmm, so you're taking
on Homeland's problems,

10:51.484 --> 10:55.288
as well as chasing down
missing explosives.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.758
I take on what I'm faced with.
Oh, well,

10:57.791 --> 10:59.292
let's hope I can
lighten the load.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.763
Or at the very least,
confirm Judy Brown was killed

11:02.796 --> 11:05.699
from acute cyanide poisoning.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.768
Found this
in her stomach contents.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.302
Suicide pill?

11:09.336 --> 11:11.972
Someone got it to her
in custody.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.941
Oh, Russo left hours
before she died.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.076
You saying he's innocent?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.377
Not necessarily.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.982
The capsule has
a polymer barrier.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.216
Gastro-resistant.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.353
It means delayed release,
Dwayne.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.321
Russo could've given
that pill to Ms. Brown

11:28.355 --> 11:29.957
hours before her death.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.324
Can you prove he did?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.326
No, stomach acid would've
removed fingerprints

11:33.360 --> 11:36.363
and DNA Russo may
have left behind.

11:36.396 --> 11:40.200
But the same cannot be said
for our unlucky bomb-maker.

11:40.233 --> 11:43.403
There was enough left
for an identification?

11:43.436 --> 11:44.404
Barely.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.375
His name is Charles Anisa,

11:48.408 --> 11:51.278
a Scottish-born
South African national.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.813
Former military.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.214
PRIDE:
Just like the five suspects

11:54.247 --> 11:57.450
Russo and DHS are
going after right now.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.887
I don't get it, Loretta.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.955
If Russo's part of the plot,

12:01.989 --> 12:04.357
why lead us right
to his co

12:05.425 --> 12:07.127
Well, the simplest explanation

12:07.160 --> 12:09.129
is always the best place
to start.

12:09.162 --> 12:13.200
Explosion at the warehouse
was an accident.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.903
Russo's just covering
his tracks.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.971
I don't think this explosion
was an accident.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.540
I found traces of a cellular
receiver amongst the debris.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.542
Even found a fragment
of the SIM card.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.112
So the bomb was
detonated remotely.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.479
No question about it.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.381
I'm trying to restore
the SIM card now,

12:28.415 --> 12:29.883
retrieve the data on it,

12:29.917 --> 12:31.418
but most likely
the bomb was set off

12:31.451 --> 12:33.220
by a simple smart phone app.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.889
Brody said Russo had
a second phone with him.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.157
The time the bomb went off.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.960
As in Brody's crush, Russo?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.461
Yeah, she thinks
he's involved in all this,

12:41.494 --> 12:43.430
and I'm starting to agree.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.999
LASALLE: The problem is we
have to find a way to prove it.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.168
Finding the rest of
the HMX would help.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.870
Well, I can't tell you
where it is,

12:49.903 --> 12:51.839
but I might be able to help
with where it's going.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.909
This looks like scrap metal.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.377
High-density
carbon steel drum.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.046
It's used for
hazardous liquids.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.414
I ran an explosives
residue test on it.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.850
I found this:

13:02.883 --> 13:04.317
High levels of HMX.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.854
So the bomb was in a drum.

13:06.887 --> 13:07.888
Exactly.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.389
Then I gave it a thorough

13:09.422 --> 13:11.859
hydrochloric acid cleanse,
like, you know, you do,

13:11.892 --> 13:12.960
and got this.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.929
Looks like a barcode.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.164
Can you read it?

13:18.431 --> 13:20.300
Maybe I can run it through

13:20.333 --> 13:22.035
a recreation program.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.905
Brody's flying blind out there
right now, Sebastian.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.173
We're gonna need
more than maybe.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.080
BRODY:
I thought we were kicking in

13:33.113 --> 13:34.214
the door with HSI.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.348
HSI's taking the front,

13:35.382 --> 13:38.218
we're covering the back.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.153
Thought you wouldn't
mind being alone with me.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.990
I like to be
where the action is.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.227
Are you mad at me or something?

13:47.260 --> 13:49.329
No.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.372
I'm adjusting a
strap on your vest.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.110
Okay, something's
definitely up here.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.412
I'm fine.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.981
Really.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.318
I'm just ready
to go get the bad guys.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.669
(woman's muffled
grunting and whimpering)

14:29.702 --> 14:31.271
Federal Agent!
Drop the weapon now!

14:33.440 --> 14:34.541
Let her go.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.442
:
Oh, my God...

14:35.475 --> 14:37.444
Drop the weapon.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.588
Whoa, Merri.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.091
I'm on your side, remember?

15:08.608 --> 15:11.111
The other night,
these men break into our house.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.950
Wave guns in our faces.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.952
Put hoods over our heads.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.288
I thought we were dead.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.522
You and your husband?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.357
Garrett.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.460
He was with me at first, but
then they kept us separate.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.695
What did they want?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.663
WOMAN:
They never spoke.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.465
They took me to
this house and...

15:35.168 --> 15:36.369
:
They just kept me locked up.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.739
Is Garrett okay?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.275
We're working on it.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.711
You haven't found him yet?

15:44.744 --> 15:46.113
Not yet, Molly,

15:46.146 --> 15:47.580
but you can help us.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.018
These men are planning
to set off a bomb in the city.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.552
Your husband may have
information they need.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.656
Did Garrett have
a high security job?

15:56.689 --> 15:58.658
Access to sensitive information?

15:58.691 --> 16:00.427
No, he's a riverman.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.030
Your husband's a river pilot?

16:04.197 --> 16:06.066
What is that?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.401
Mississippi's complicated
to navigate--

16:08.435 --> 16:11.138
shifting sandbars, currents...

16:11.171 --> 16:13.173
Rivermen are the ones who get
the ships through.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.542
Bomb's gonna be on the river.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.444
MOLLY:
You'll help him,

16:17.477 --> 16:19.446
right

16:19.479 --> 16:21.248
We'll bring him back.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.317
And we'll keep you safe, too.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.585
Okay?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.320
I'm gonna see to it personally.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.359
Yes, sir...

16:33.493 --> 16:34.627
You all right?

16:34.661 --> 16:37.364
Thank you.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.066
Weren't supposed to be
alone with him.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.333
That was the plan.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.335
I didn't have a
choice or time.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.771
Could've been you who got shot.

16:44.804 --> 16:49.442
Instead, he killed another
link to the explosions,

16:49.476 --> 16:51.411
and the attack.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.080
Like he's planned
the whole thing.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.449
All the information
he gives is solid.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.685
Leads us one step closer
to the conspiracy.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.121
He ties up loose ends
just as we get there.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.322
He's playing us.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.756
Maybe the river's
a distraction.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.492
Don't think it is.
Sebastian recovered the barcode

17:05.525 --> 17:08.161
on the explosive debris
from this morning.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.696
Supposed to be
part of a shipment

17:09.729 --> 17:11.698
of 30 fuel barrels headed
for the Port of New Orleans.

17:11.731 --> 17:12.799
We tracked the shipment
to the dock,

17:12.832 --> 17:14.401
but the barrels
are already gone.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.836
No record of what vessel
they've been loaded on,

17:16.869 --> 17:19.272
but close to
1,000 pounds of HMX

17:19.306 --> 17:20.473
is already on the water.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.674
This attack is gonna be soon.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.742
RUSSO:
Pride.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.812
DC wants a report.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.482
Contact CGIS Agent Swanson,

17:29.516 --> 17:31.251
coordinate with Coast Guard,

17:31.284 --> 17:32.452
find that boat.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.653
Brody, Russo...

17:33.686 --> 17:35.322
RUSSO:
We've got 1,000 pounds

17:35.355 --> 17:38.791
of HMX on the Mississippi
River, Deputy Secretary.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.228
Suspects took a
river pilot hostage.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.664
Means they can detonate the bomb
anywhere along the Mississippi.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.865
The situation is critical.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.600
Can you estimate
damage assessment?

17:47.634 --> 17:49.369
Bomb of this size,

17:49.402 --> 17:52.339
set off at any number of
strategic points on the river,

17:52.372 --> 17:53.806
casualties start
in the hundreds.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.608
Plus, environmental effects
to the ground water

17:55.642 --> 17:57.410
and surrounding communities.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.678
Not to mention shutting down

17:58.711 --> 18:00.280
a main economic
artery to the city.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.614
It's a conservative estimate.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.683
Without General Matthews
to run the division,

18:03.716 --> 18:04.884
this falls on you, John.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.586
It's what I'm trained for.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.157
You have operational control

18:10.190 --> 18:11.791
of all Law Enforcement
assets in the area.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.793
Yes, sir.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.562
I'd like to note that

18:15.595 --> 18:18.298
Special Agent Pride and his
team have been invaluable.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.567
I want them in the field
as my eyes and ears.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.801
Whatever you need, John.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.403
I'm counting on you.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.604
I won't let you down, sir.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.141
I mean that.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.709
Relying on you both.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.378
No one knows this city better.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.313
Appreciate the confidence.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.714
Pride...

18:34.747 --> 18:36.649
gotta take this.
Yeah.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.855
PRIDE:
Russo's upstairs making calls.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.324
Don't have much time.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.559
Fine, 'cause I don't
have much to say.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.828
I did a deep dive
in Russo's past.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.563
Makes a Boy Scout look corrupt.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.199
Columbia University,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.234
Air Force,
followed by Harvard Law.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.935
Yeah, then, instead of
taking his pick of jobs

18:55.968 --> 18:57.470
in DC in the private sector,

18:57.504 --> 18:58.938
he goes Peace Corps
for two years.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.508
No hidden accounts, no alias,
no Dark Web profile.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.742
He's on the up and up.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.477
He's anything but.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.745
Playing the long game.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.281
Worked his way through DHS

19:08.315 --> 19:10.250
to be two man in his division.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.884
Made sure there
was no number one.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.620
That's why he set up
General Matthews.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.821
To keep the post open,

19:14.854 --> 19:16.356
to take control
of the investigation

19:16.389 --> 19:17.824
into his own plot.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.227
Then who's he working for,
terrorists?

19:20.260 --> 19:22.695
Whoever it is, hired
South African mercenaries,

19:22.729 --> 19:24.764
has access to a submarine,

19:24.797 --> 19:27.267
military-grade HMX--
could be an enemy state.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.636
I guess we'll have to
figure it out as we go.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.638
Getting good at improvising
these days, huh?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.373
We may know one thing
that might help.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.341
SEBASTIAN:
All right, well,

19:34.374 --> 19:35.775
I was able to confirm that
this morning's bomb

19:35.808 --> 19:36.943
was set off by a cell phone.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.578
I even tracked the signal,

19:38.611 --> 19:40.280
but I couldn't pull any data.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.514
PATTON:
Phone is encrypted.

19:41.548 --> 19:42.782
Russo's second phone?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.517
Can't be sure
unless we examine it.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.519
Well, Russo's not letting
that phone out of his sight.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.788
Doesn't have to.
We just need to clone it.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.258
Won't know we did it
until you slap him in cuffs.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.260
Which means that you have to
get close to him

19:53.293 --> 19:54.461
without him getting suspicious.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.662
It's not a good idea.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.298
I can do it.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.400
If it means stopping
the attack, I can do it.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.535
Puts you back
in the line of fire.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.870
He may be on to you already.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.572
Do we have a choice?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.877
We have no authority
to access Russo's phone.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.279
Just theories.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.681
If we do it and fail,

20:14.714 --> 20:17.317
it's not only losing our jobs,

20:17.350 --> 20:18.585
we could go to prison.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.424
All right.

20:24.457 --> 20:27.660
Give Brody whatever she needs
to clone that phone.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.734
SONJA:
We're looking for a boat

20:34.767 --> 20:36.303
filled with 1,000 pounds of HMX.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.704
Well, you came
to the right place.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.439
Nerve center
of all traffic on the river.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.040
LASALLE:
What's it do?

20:41.073 --> 20:43.843
Puts eyes on any ship, boat,
or barge on the Mississippi.

20:43.876 --> 20:44.977
Any idea what class vessel

20:45.011 --> 20:47.447
we're looking for?
Tug, river, cargo?

20:47.480 --> 20:48.448
Don't know.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.716
All we can say is,

20:49.749 --> 20:51.651
we think it left the port
late this morning.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.386
Yeah, it's like a
needle in a haystack.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.821
Well, consider me
your pitchfork.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.289
The Captain of the
Port ordered a stop

20:56.323 --> 20:57.757
on all river traffic.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.592
It's like a giant
game of red rover.

20:59.626 --> 21:03.863
You break it,
you buy it, Lasalle.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.599
We got a winner.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.967
The Heritage Star,

21:08.000 --> 21:09.502
tugboat out of Natchez.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.871
Not responding
to the COTP order.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.806
It could be a miscommunication.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.408
Or it could be our bomb.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.043
SWANSON:
Motor Vessel Heritage Star,

21:17.076 --> 21:18.411
this is the Coast Guard
Sector New Orleans

21:18.445 --> 21:20.012
on channel 16, over.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.814
Motor Vessel Heritage Star,
this is United States

21:21.848 --> 21:23.716
Coast Guard on channel 16.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.086
You're in violation of
a Captain of the Port Order.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.722
Come to all stop now
and hold your position.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.758
HIJACKER: Don't answer!
Stay on course!

21:36.963 --> 21:38.965
Heritage Star,
this is your final warning.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.300
Come to all stop immediately.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.645
They're not responding.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.730
SWANSON:
MSST's are ready to roll.

22:10.763 --> 22:11.931
The 87's gonna be en route

22:11.964 --> 22:13.966
to block the Heritage Star
upriver.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.403
Air Station's on scene in ten.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.837
PRIDE:
We need to go with MSST

22:17.870 --> 22:19.005
and board the Heritage Star.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.440
Agent Russo already cleared it.

22:20.473 --> 22:21.741
We got room on
the small boats for two.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.543
I'm gonna coordinate
from the cutter.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.111
Russo already cleared it?

22:25.144 --> 22:27.079
It means he wants us
on the Heritage Star.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.848
You think it's a trap?

22:28.881 --> 22:30.483
Either way, we got to do it.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.485
We got a crew of ten
on that tug.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.720
All right, I'm with you, King.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.688
She said there's
only room for two.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.989
Got to take Sonja.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.858
She's got the
explosives experience.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.461
Well, I don't think
that's a good idea.
Excuse me?

22:41.494 --> 22:43.396
Russo doesn't expect us
to return.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.664
All right?
It's too risky.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.765
For me, but not for you?

22:45.798 --> 22:47.166
Well, you know what I mean.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.801
I'm sorry, I don't.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.002
This is my job

22:50.036 --> 22:51.438
as much as yours, Lasalle.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.639
Okay, all right, look,

22:52.672 --> 22:54.774
we don't have time to argue.

22:54.807 --> 22:55.975
Russo's got a plan here.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.811
We still need to figure it out
before that bomb goes off.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.913
You go on the cutter
with Swanson,

23:00.947 --> 23:02.181
and be our eyes.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.451
That leaves Brody
alone with Russo.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.719
Yeah, well, she'll
get the evidence,

23:06.753 --> 23:08.888
contact DHS,
call in the cavalry.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.859
It's not perfect, Chris.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.393
Best we got.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.069
BRODY:
Okay, Sebastian.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.472
Uh, this doesn't look like much.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.440
It's got special software
that'll detect, decrypt,

23:27.474 --> 23:28.675
and download
every byte of data

23:28.708 --> 23:29.676
on Russo's phone.

23:29.709 --> 23:30.810
Great, what do I have to do?

23:30.843 --> 23:32.111
Just get close.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.547
I'm talking like
Arrid Extra Dry close.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.217
There's not a lot of scenarios

23:38.250 --> 23:40.152
where that kind of
invasion of personal space

23:40.186 --> 23:41.854
is going to be
socially acceptable, okay?

23:41.888 --> 23:43.756
Just-- trust me, I know.

23:43.790 --> 23:44.791
There was one time in grad
school where I went to a par--

23:44.824 --> 23:46.726
I've got it covered, Sebastian.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.061
I just hate that he
used you, you know?

23:49.095 --> 23:51.664
The only thing I hate more
is that you got to go

23:51.698 --> 23:53.733
back up there and
pretend like he didn't.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.068
I'll be okay.
Oh, hey, wait, wait, wait.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.637
Take this, uh,

23:57.670 --> 23:59.639
in case of emergency.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.173
Am I supposed to write for help?

24:01.207 --> 24:03.175
It's not a pen, it's a stun gun.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.678
You just click the top,
it packs 200,000 volts.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.548
You know I'm armed, right?
Oh, yeah.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.216
So is Russo.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.986
I'll be fine.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.692
The Heritage Star's
about a mile downriver,

24:19.726 --> 24:20.927
moving at 14 knots.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.529
You got eyes on them?

24:22.562 --> 24:24.964
No visual yet,
but we put a drone in the air

24:24.997 --> 24:26.633
and we hacked into

24:26.666 --> 24:29.669
the Heritage Star's
security cameras.

24:29.702 --> 24:30.970
We got two hostiles
on the bridge...

24:31.003 --> 24:32.238
LASALLE:
And that's Garrett Layne,

24:32.271 --> 24:33.640
our kidnapped
river boat pilot.

24:33.673 --> 24:34.707
Another hostile
on the main deck,

24:34.741 --> 24:35.975
fourth is below deck.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.810
LASALLE:
It's our South African suspects

24:37.844 --> 24:39.045
we've been looking for.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.913
Got assault rifles, sidearms.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.649
That guy looks like
he might have grenades.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.183
Detonator on any
of these hostiles?

24:44.216 --> 24:45.718
Not that we've noticed.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.486
All right, there's no
room for error here.

24:49.288 --> 24:51.123
All CG Vessels, this is CAPCON.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.525
Boarding team en route.

24:52.559 --> 24:53.926
Air Station is two minutes out.

25:05.572 --> 25:08.174
Hi.
Hi.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.776
Can we talk for a second?

25:09.809 --> 25:11.644
Of course. About what?

25:16.916 --> 25:18.084
I'm worried, John.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.886
This interdiction,

25:19.919 --> 25:22.689
if anything goes wrong,
my whole team could be killed.

25:22.722 --> 25:23.956
I could lose them all

25:23.990 --> 25:25.224
and I don't think
I can handle that.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.627
Hey, hey, hey.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.029
Listen to me:
it's gonna be okay.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.297
We've got the Coast Guard

25:31.330 --> 25:33.800
and an army of
federal agents on our side.

25:33.833 --> 25:37.704
I swear to you,
I won't let anything go wrong.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.838
Okay.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.619
Better get back out there.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.353
Yeah.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.255
Thank you.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.991
Anytime.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.603
SWANSON :
Motor Vessel Heritage Star,

26:10.637 --> 26:12.304
this is the Coast Guard
on channel 16.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.273
Stop your engines,
drop your weapons,

26:14.306 --> 26:16.342
heave to, and prepare
to be boarded.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.077
Air Station coming in
for diversion.

26:19.746 --> 26:20.680
Fire warning shots now.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.616
Agent Pride,
you're clear to approach

26:23.650 --> 26:24.917
at the starboard aft.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.286
Air Station,
another burst of fire.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.297
We'll take the bridge.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.298
Get down below deck,

26:39.331 --> 26:40.633
find the fourth hijacker.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.255
Drop your weapon!

27:03.289 --> 27:04.623
Now!

27:09.762 --> 27:12.832
SONJA: Put your hands
behind your head.

27:12.865 --> 27:16.135
Grab the hostages.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.770
Where is the detonator?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.419
We're pinned down, Chris.

27:33.452 --> 27:36.022
Hostiles in the aft section
of the bridge.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.323
Port side.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.736
Freeze!

27:57.910 --> 27:59.145
Bridge secure.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.081
Garrett Layne,

28:02.114 --> 28:04.216
I'm Special Agent
Dwayne Pride, NCIS.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.952
You need to stop
this boat right now.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.353
No, sir.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.388
I can't.

28:09.421 --> 28:10.489
SONJA:
Pride...

28:10.522 --> 28:12.224
the fourth hijacker
is in custody,

28:12.258 --> 28:14.994
and I found the explosives,
but no sign of the detonator.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.796
Think we just found it.

28:20.232 --> 28:23.002
Detonator's connected
to the GPS, Chris.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.470
If the tug's diverted
from its heading,

28:24.503 --> 28:27.239
or slows, bomb goes off.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.910
Special Agent Percy's
trying to defuse it.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.748
Patton.
PATTON:
Cracked the SIM card

28:35.782 --> 28:37.784
on Russo's phone.
We hit the mother lode.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.285
SEBASTIAN:
The data files confirm

28:39.318 --> 28:41.053
that he detonated the
warehouse bomb this morning.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.155
Does he have the capability
of setting off the bomb

28:43.189 --> 28:44.356
on that tug boat?

28:44.390 --> 28:45.758
SEBASTIAN:
I'm afraid so.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.193
But listen, that's not all.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.360
Russo's been in contact

28:48.394 --> 28:49.962
with one of the hijackers
all day.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.831
He's pulling all the strings.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.966
I still have no idea why.
PATTON: We might.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.836
Russo's been receiving
encrypted e-mails.

28:56.869 --> 28:59.171
We traced it back to server
in Bogota, Colombia.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.472
Yeah, sophisticated
encryption,

29:00.506 --> 29:03.209
military equipment,
hired mercenaries.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.344
I mean, I know that we were
thinking enemy state.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.246
Yeah, but it could be
the cartels.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.115
Why would they
blow the river?

29:09.148 --> 29:11.250
E-mails indicate their target
to be the Coast Guard itself.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.852
No idea why.

29:12.885 --> 29:15.521
Those Coast Guard boats are
blocking the river

29:15.554 --> 29:17.523
directly under the
Crescent City Connection.

29:17.556 --> 29:22.094
That bomb goes off, it takes out
the boats and the bridge.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.463
You tell Pride now.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.497
I'm detaining Russo.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.823
Commander!

29:50.857 --> 29:53.359
NCIS has evidence that
this ship is the target

29:53.392 --> 29:54.894
and the Crescent City
Connection.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.963
You must take evasive action.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.497
Not that simple. I have orders.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.967
Plus a mission to protect
the river from that tugboat.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.334
Well, your orders came
from the person

30:02.368 --> 30:04.236
who set this whole attack up.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.371
What's that supposed to mean?

30:05.404 --> 30:06.605
Look, sir, you have to listen.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.974
If you don't move
out of my way,

30:08.007 --> 30:09.976
I'll have you removed.
Swanson,

30:10.009 --> 30:11.978
you must have heard
about the breach at DHS.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.512
Task force is looking
for the mole.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.381
I know, but how would you know
anything about that?

30:15.414 --> 30:16.916
I have the evidence
right here.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.318
Commander...
Commander, listen, damn it.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.121
Special Agent Swanson,
escort Special Agent Lasalle

30:22.154 --> 30:24.857
below deck.
Look, the Heritage Star
is rigged to explode

30:24.891 --> 30:26.525
if it's taken
off course, all right?

30:26.558 --> 30:28.527
And it will definitely explode
if it gets close enough

30:28.560 --> 30:30.462
to us.
That bridge goes down,

30:30.496 --> 30:32.999
takes out God knows
how many innocents.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.001
Then I'll have the skipper fire
on that tugboat.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.403
Look, we still have
agents on that boat.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.139
And at least
one hostage.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.309
All right, my people is working
on disarming the bomb.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.011
We just need more time.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.313
He's right.
We need your help here.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.150
Okay, you got three minutes.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.552
And at that point, anybody that
can get off the boat should.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.421
We gotta protect
that bridge.

30:55.454 --> 30:58.157
I'll contact DHS,
make sure Russo gets dealt with.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.326
Pride, Percy...

31:01.527 --> 31:02.895
...I bought you enough time

31:02.929 --> 31:04.296
to disarm the bomb.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.465
I'll need about a week.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.268
Yeah, well,
you got three minutes.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.907
Gonna get you
off the boat, Garrett.

31:14.941 --> 31:17.176
I can't let go
of the controls.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.577
Yeah. Yes, you can.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.446
'Cause I'm gonna
switch places with you.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.248
Crazy, huh?

31:22.281 --> 31:26.052
But that's what's happening.

31:26.085 --> 31:27.653
It's not like driving a car.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.588
My uncle was a riverman.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.390
I know my way around the helm.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.659
We're gonna take it slow.

31:33.692 --> 31:37.063
Easy-- just one hand,
and then the other.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.231
No, no, I-I just...

31:39.265 --> 31:40.566
I just need to...
I promised your wife

31:40.599 --> 31:42.368
I'd get you home safely.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.337
Don't want
to make me a liar, do you?

31:45.371 --> 31:48.440
Huh?
Okay...

31:48.474 --> 31:50.142
Easy.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.477
Just let it go.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.014
There you go. Okay.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.049
Take the other one off.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.085
I got it.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.686
Good job.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.388
Everybody off.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.123
Go. Go. That's an order.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.624
I got the controls, Chris.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.928
Just like a Kingfisher.

32:16.002 --> 32:18.104
You're too clever, Merri.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.605
That mean you're
surrendering?

32:19.638 --> 32:24.076
That means
today's gonna end badly for you

32:24.110 --> 32:26.045
and your team.

32:30.482 --> 32:33.052
Soon as that boat
gets close enough...

32:33.085 --> 32:35.221
You're doing all this...
Sit down.

32:36.688 --> 32:38.557
...for drug dealers?

32:38.590 --> 32:40.692
How much could they possibly be
paying you

32:40.726 --> 32:42.561
to betray your country?
You got me wrong!

32:42.594 --> 32:45.164
I'm a patriot.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.266
Just not for your side.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.568
I don't understand, John.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.672
Don't you want to matter, Merri?

32:53.705 --> 32:56.708
Be more than just a cog.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.279
They saw the potential in me.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.314
More than any law firm,

33:02.348 --> 33:03.449
or government agency,

33:03.482 --> 33:05.684
to be exceptional;
to matter.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.053
By blowing up some boats?

33:07.086 --> 33:08.254
Taking out a bridge?

33:08.287 --> 33:09.721
How many people have
we lost...

33:09.755 --> 33:11.423
to the Coast Guard,

33:11.457 --> 33:14.026
to the military.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.427
I'm making a statement.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.698
It's petty, John.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.733
Don't be hurt.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.603
I enjoyed our
time together.

33:28.074 --> 33:30.176
I really like you.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.311
I liked you, too.

33:33.745 --> 33:35.447
Sonja,

33:35.481 --> 33:36.715
we're running out of time.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.385
I'm getting there, okay?

33:39.418 --> 33:42.554
One of these wires leads
to the cellular detonator.

33:42.588 --> 33:44.823
Find that, and I'll
diffuse the bomb.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.525
Got the cutter in view.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.629
Just past the bridge.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.284
Out of time here,
Special Agent.

34:12.318 --> 34:13.785
Gunners, in position.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.821
Get Agent Percy
off that boat.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.389
What about Pride?

34:17.423 --> 34:19.158
You want to lose them both?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.229
Sonja...

34:23.262 --> 34:25.131
that's it. Time's up.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.265
Stop talking!

34:29.768 --> 34:30.736
All right, Sonja...

34:32.438 --> 34:34.240
it's over.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.544
Time to go. Now.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.781
Get out of here!
It's time to go!

34:42.814 --> 34:43.882
Sonja...

34:43.915 --> 34:45.251
get out of here! Now!

34:45.284 --> 34:47.319
Okay.

34:47.353 --> 34:48.787
One more second.

34:57.163 --> 34:58.397
OFFICER :
Gunners ready...

35:09.708 --> 35:11.243
(pressing key,
repeated beeping)

35:16.815 --> 35:19.618
Don't move.
You're under arrest.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.453
It's over, John.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.927
Coming about.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.795
PRIDE:
Bomb is diffused.

35:29.828 --> 35:30.862
:
Call 'em off the strike.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.499
I repeat: bomb is diffused,
call off the strike.

35:33.532 --> 35:36.902
OFFICER :
Gunner! Stand down! Stand down!

35:52.351 --> 35:53.852
MAN:
Open the door! Open up!

35:53.885 --> 35:55.654
(man continues shouting,
pounding on door)

36:29.655 --> 36:31.890
Whatcha got?

36:31.923 --> 36:34.360
DHS cleared Brody,

36:34.393 --> 36:35.927
and Garrett Layne
reunited with his wife,

36:35.961 --> 36:37.696
so all in all,

36:37.729 --> 36:39.231
we should be celebrating.

36:39.265 --> 36:41.700
Yes, we should.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.869
How'd it go with DC?

36:43.902 --> 36:45.604
Far as they're concerned,
without us,

36:45.637 --> 36:49.908
yesterday would have
been catastrophic.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.010
I feel like there's
a big "but" coming.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.979
Russo got too close

36:54.012 --> 36:57.349
to pulling off his mission
from inside.

36:57.383 --> 36:58.950
Which means...

36:58.984 --> 37:02.621
Full review
of the entire affair.

37:02.654 --> 37:05.291
All right? From General Matthews
to yesterday.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.492
And until the review's complete,

37:06.525 --> 37:07.959
we are on administrative leave.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.261
Two weeks.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.863
That sounds like
a punishment.

37:11.897 --> 37:12.964
It's a break.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.333
Which we need.

37:14.366 --> 37:15.334
Agent Hardy's gonna

37:15.367 --> 37:17.636
cover our cases.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.272
We'll take some R&R.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.274
Well, I'll let Percy know.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.312
You're going to ask
me how I'm doing.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.981
And you're gonna
tell me you're fine.

37:30.015 --> 37:32.418
No. But I will be.

37:32.451 --> 37:35.954
I just need to
sort this all out.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.956
I can't believe I
let Russo get close.

37:37.989 --> 37:40.759
You didn't let Russo get close.

37:40.792 --> 37:41.827
You stopped him.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.996
I was lucky.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.532
You were smart.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.033
Listened to that voice
inside you.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.636
You should do it more often.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.338
Well, right now,
that voice is saying,

37:52.371 --> 37:53.605
"Go to a secluded beach."

37:55.073 --> 37:58.377
I'll clear my mind.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.446
It's 5:00 somewhere.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.587
LASALLE: Pride says we're on
administrative leave.

38:08.620 --> 38:09.488
Two week vacation.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.957
Oh, wow.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.091
You don't have
to tell me twice.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.326
I'll see you later.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.429
Yo, Percy.

38:17.463 --> 38:18.330
You just going to leave?

38:18.364 --> 38:19.631
Oh, I didn't realize

38:19.665 --> 38:22.100
I needed to check in with you.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.669
Well, I thought
you might want to talk.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.036
Oh, "work husband" means

38:25.070 --> 38:27.673
your responsibilities
end aft work.

38:27.706 --> 38:28.740
See ya later.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.609
Well, you almost
died yesterday.

38:31.610 --> 38:34.646
Yeah, and you almost died
a few weeks ago.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.382
But we lived.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.549
I go now.

38:37.583 --> 38:38.484
Did I offend you somehow?

38:38.517 --> 38:41.587
No. But you need
to stop worrying about me.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.688
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.556
It means don't treat me

38:44.590 --> 38:45.824
different from everyone else.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.593
It especially means
don't try to stop me

38:47.626 --> 38:48.927
from taking dangerous jobs.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.397
Don't get soft on me.

38:51.430 --> 38:52.398
I'm not soft.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.466
I care about you, you idiot.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.868
Well, stop, 'cause...

38:56.902 --> 38:58.504
I-I can't take it on.

39:11.617 --> 39:14.753
I'm glad you didn't die.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.555
You're an ass.

39:18.424 --> 39:19.791
Yeah. I know.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.467
All right. Cool.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.535
I'll see you later.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.407
And I'll see you soon.

39:37.876 --> 39:41.513
WALTER "WOLFMAN" WASHINGTON:
* Ooh, baby *

39:41.547 --> 39:42.648
* Tell me, baby

39:42.681 --> 39:43.982
* I love you

39:44.015 --> 39:47.018
*

39:47.052 --> 39:48.887
* Now that I love you...

39:52.691 --> 39:53.859
PATTON:
Oh.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.461
You're getting pathetic,
Sebastian.

39:55.494 --> 39:56.528
Just, I'm-I'm saving
the high heat

39:56.562 --> 39:57.796
for when Brody gets here.

39:57.829 --> 39:58.697
Oh, you're gonna be
waiting a long time.

39:58.730 --> 39:59.731
Merri hit the road.

39:59.765 --> 40:02.067
She's heading to the Keys.

40:02.100 --> 40:02.968
She left?

40:03.001 --> 40:03.702
Mm.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.136
PATTON:
I'm still here for you.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.705
Come on. One more game.

40:06.738 --> 40:07.739
I'll take it easy on you.

40:07.773 --> 40:08.974
BUCKLEY:
Miss Loretta.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.209
I call it
"Death Takes a Holiday."

40:11.242 --> 40:12.978
Oh! Poetic and accurate.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.781
But is it good?

40:15.814 --> 40:17.716
Mmm!

40:17.749 --> 40:18.684
Oh, delicious.

40:18.717 --> 40:19.818
Another satisfied customer.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.588
Hey.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.122
Hey, boss.
You on duty tonight?

40:24.155 --> 40:25.791
I most definitely am not.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.092
Yeah.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.093
Fellas?
Hmm?

40:28.126 --> 40:29.461
Oh, look at that face.
Yep.

40:29.495 --> 40:31.530
How's it going?
Not that great.

40:31.563 --> 40:32.864
Good.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.232
Look at that score there.
I'm killing it.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.133
Easy on him, would you?

40:36.034 --> 40:37.002
Ah, thank you.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.137
Loretta... feeling good.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.739
Despite the news
from Washington.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.140
Prying into your business.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.575
Eh, it doesn't bode well.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.544
But you know what I call that?

40:45.577 --> 40:46.812
Tomorrow's problem.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.947
I like the attitude.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.683
You gonna miss us
while we're on leave?
Mm-mm.

40:51.717 --> 40:55.120
Taking advantage and
using a few vacation days.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.556
Danny's graduating
this month.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.558
Asked him what he would
want for a gift.

40:59.591 --> 41:02.794
He said to go camping out west.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.096
Loretta,
you have many talents.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.066
Outdoorsman is not one of them.
Not one of them.

41:08.099 --> 41:09.901
:
Not even close.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.703
You're welcome to come along.

41:11.737 --> 41:13.605
Thank you, but I have plans.

41:13.639 --> 41:17.108
Right.
Two weeks to work at the bar.

41:17.142 --> 41:20.879
No, ma'am. I'm leaving the bar
in Buckley's capable hands.

41:20.912 --> 41:23.014
I promise I won't burn it down.

41:23.048 --> 41:24.716
Appreciate that.

41:24.750 --> 41:25.917
Laurel's doing a...

41:25.951 --> 41:29.254
an internship
in Oberlin, Ohio.

41:29.287 --> 41:32.023
And I have a gig.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.760
As in music?
Yes, as in music.

41:34.793 --> 41:36.094
Walter "Wolfman" Washington

41:36.127 --> 41:38.229
lost his piano
player for a month.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.732
I'm filling in while they're
playing in the Southeast.

41:40.766 --> 41:42.100
Dwayne Pride...
Mm-hmm.

41:42.133 --> 41:45.036
On tour.
I'll drink to that.
Come on.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.172
Dwayne, we need you
up here, my brother.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.108
Here I come.
Excuse me.

42:01.820 --> 42:05.791
* Just take those old records
off the shelf *

42:05.824 --> 42:08.994
* I'll sit and listen
to them by myself *

42:09.027 --> 42:13.565
* Today's music
ain't got the same soul *

42:13.599 --> 42:15.734
* I love that old-time
rock and roll *

42:17.869 --> 42:22.207
*
