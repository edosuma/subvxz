30:28.880 --> 30:31.451
Like you, I was selected.

30:33.120 --> 30:38.001
I know now his hand
guided my entire life.

30:39.120 --> 30:42.442
I know, Susan Duncan, my mother,

30:43.360 --> 30:45.124
once stood here as I am.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.571
Appointed to move the future forward,

30:49.360 --> 30:50.486
and she did.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.925
She created me.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.804
It is time to be brave, to sacrifice.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.050
The fruits of nearly 200 years

31:01.120 --> 31:04.488
of Neolution science
are now within our grasp.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.969
And we, here,

31:07.440 --> 31:09.488
shall drink from the fountain first.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.846
(ALL CHEERING)

31:38.120 --> 31:39.201
(CAR LOCK CHIRPS)

31:45.240 --> 31:46.446
- Freeze.
-Whoa!

31:46.520 --> 31:48.170
On your knees, hands on your head.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.685
Okay, just calm down.

31:50.800 --> 31:51.847
Oh, Jesus!

31:51.920 --> 31:52.921
(BOTH GRUNTING)

31:54.600 --> 31:55.886

32:07.440 --> 32:08.487
Helena. Helena!

32:08.560 --> 32:09.561
Ouch!

32:10.000 --> 32:11.047
Oh, my God!

32:13.560 --> 32:16.245
- Stick in baby.
-Okay. Okay. just...

32:16.760 --> 32:17.886
Oh, my God.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.450
We're gonna get you
to the hospital, okay?

32:20.040 --> 32:21.121
This is gonna hurt.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.771
-(SCREAMS)
-Oh, God!

32:29.200 --> 32:30.201
(DOOR OPENS)

32:51.320 --> 32:52.321
(GAS PS)

33:42.240 --> 33:43.446
Oh, my God!

33:44.080 --> 33:46.367
- Shh... Shh... It's me. It's me.
-Sarah?

33:47.040 --> 33:49.361
- Wait... What?
-I came to get you.

33:49.520 --> 33:50.681
How did you get here?

33:52.080 --> 33:53.081
Oh, my God!

33:53.560 --> 33:54.721
You're bleeding.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.649
- Hold on.
-There's a boathouse...

33:57.840 --> 33:59.365
- Found a boat.
-Sit.

33:59.440 --> 34:00.487
Sit down.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.930
What the hell happened?

34:03.960 --> 34:05.405
Rachel went mad.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.803
-(SIGHS)
-Yea h, I know.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.806
- Just, here. Let me take a look at you.
-(GROANS)

34:19.960 --> 34:21.324
Mmm. (GASPS)

34:21.400 --> 34:24.529
Er, what? Erm, I'm sorry. I...
I didn't fall asleep.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.525
What about your cure?

34:30.120 --> 34:32.521
Er... Well, Rachel didn't get all of it.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.725
You're meant to put that in your uterus?

34:35.360 --> 34:36.850
I was kind of hoping
you would, actually.

34:37.639 --> 34:39.449
No. No way. You and I
are gonna go find Charlotte...

34:39.800 --> 34:40.847
(SIGHS)

34:40.920 --> 34:42.570
...and we're gonna get you
to somewhere safe.

34:42.639 --> 34:43.721
We'll treat you there.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.929
Who gives a shit if the founder of
Neolution is still alive?

34:48.080 --> 34:49.161
I do.

34:49.880 --> 34:50.880
You're crazy.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.647
- We need to go, Cosima.
-No, I can't.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.001
What are you talking about?

34:55.960 --> 34:56.960
Look.

34:57.440 --> 34:58.771
Think about it, Sarah.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.731
Whatever this place is, it's the answer.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.041
I don't give a shit.

35:04.440 --> 35:07.523
I came all this way.
Rachel tried to kill me.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.489
Cosima, you're gonna come home with me.

35:09.560 --> 35:10.800
No. You need to go back.

35:11.120 --> 35:14.886
And take care of Siobhan and Kira,
and I need to stay here for us.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.243
We'll never be free if I leave now.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.250
- She's not here.
-What?

35:21.800 --> 35:23.086
(WHISTLES)

35:24.280 --> 35:25.645
(MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

35:30.480 --> 35:32.528
This is gonna be for me. You have to go.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.527
Oh, Christ!

35:35.280 --> 35:36.805
I really don't want to leave you here.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.365
This Way's clear. Come on!

35:39.440 --> 35:41.283
There is something in the woods, Cosima.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.001
What?

35:43.160 --> 35:45.447
- What do you mean?
-I don't know. I don't know.

35:45.760 --> 35:48.047
It attacked me, all right?

35:49.400 --> 35:50.686
Just take care of yourself.

35:51.480 --> 35:54.484
- Find some answers.
-Yeah, yeah.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.650

36:22.760 --> 36:23.761
Oh!

36:23.960 --> 36:24.961
(DOOR OPENS)

36:25.840 --> 36:26.841
What are you doing?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.127
She's here.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.361
Oh.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.690
Leave us, please.

36:38.840 --> 36:42.162
Not the easiest procedure
to perform on oneself, is it?

36:45.640 --> 36:48.166
I knew some of
the sell line was missing.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.842
I keep very thorough logs.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.610
Stop, Cosima.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.045
You'll hurt yourself.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.686
Give me the needle.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.041
Cosima?

37:06.080 --> 37:08.287
I'm as invested in this as you are.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.246
Thank you.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.204
Come. Lie down.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.561
You're sure you know what you're doing?

37:27.360 --> 37:29.328
It has to be inserted
into the uterine wall.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.606
(SHUSHING)

37:31.160 --> 37:32.161
Relax.

37:33.440 --> 37:34.566
Just breathe.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.446
There's no need to be afraid any more.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.242
He wants you to be part of this.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.040
You and I are going to cure us all.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.125
Just hit me, Rachel.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.965
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

39:09.600 --> 39:10.601
Hey!

39:25.600 --> 39:26.601
Night, night.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.251
It's a new day, Sarah.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.001
Kira!

39:58.080 --> 40:00.890
- We'd like to study her here at...
-(CLANKING)

40:00.960 --> 40:01.961
We found MK.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.281
Rachel wants to restart human cloning.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.600
The easier you make this for us,

40:05.680 --> 40:07.808
the easier you make it
on my new partner here.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.041
My babies are special like Kira.

40:09.320 --> 40:10.731
They want our biologist.

40:10.800 --> 40:15.203
I know you created me, so what the hell
is the point of all of this?

40:15.280 --> 40:17.044
We're going to take
such good care of you.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.366
You bitch!
