WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:03.594
- Previously on The Shield- 
- Ever killed something before?

00:03.703 --> 00:07.696
There's a look in a thing's eyes.
They're on the edge of this great big hole...

00:07.807 --> 00:10.401
and they'll do anything
not to fall in.

00:10.510 --> 00:14.606
And at that last moment,
looking into their eyes-

00:14.714 --> 00:16.409
You see the face of God.

00:16.516 --> 00:19.041
[Hisses, Yowls]

00:22.589 --> 00:25.820
[Claudette's Voice] Kleavon Gardner-
questioned in four homicides.

00:25.925 --> 00:28.223
Maybe you, uh, happened by
this crime scene too?

00:28.328 --> 00:30.694
Yeah. I didn't kill her.

00:30.797 --> 00:32.924
He didn't even blink
at those photos.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.365
Classic sociopathic
nonreaction.

00:35.468 --> 00:38.232
- [Claudette] He's innocent.
- Guy's still a stone-cold killer.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.932
Got a suspect and no victim.
That's new.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.306
You ever suck a dick
like a cell bitch, cop?

00:44.411 --> 00:46.777
- Suck it!
- [Coughing]

00:46.880 --> 00:49.075
- I worked with Rich Nelson.
- How's he doin'?

00:49.182 --> 00:50.547
Passed three years ago.

00:50.650 --> 00:53.016
He was always talkin' about
how he was gonna piss on my grave.

00:53.119 --> 00:54.848
[Snickering]

00:54.954 --> 00:57.320
Rich Nelson and his task force
had a rough time nailing you...

00:57.424 --> 01:00.052
- but they did.
- Took 13 years of my life.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.594
Just found a crack in
Antwon Mitchell's family seal.

01:02.695 --> 01:05.562
His oldest son, Donald ///'s been
moving fake /.D. 's out ofhis van.

01:05.665 --> 01:09.897
I got an idea how to get him back
for all those sad Christmas mornings.

01:10.003 --> 01:13.939
I don't like the dude, but I ain't gonna help
the white occupation take him down either.

01:14.040 --> 01:18.170
They busted my son. They're comin'
to get me through my blood, man.

01:18.278 --> 01:21.645
- Is this part of Antwon's operation?
- This block? Yeah, it's gotta be.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.683
This is the little ho
that gave up my block.

01:24.784 --> 01:28.083
- [Gunshots]
- Her body shows up...

01:28.188 --> 01:31.783
with bullets in it
from your two gats...

01:31.891 --> 01:34.587
you'll be doin' time
for a long, long time.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.424
From now on,
I say, "Suck my dick,"

01:37.530 --> 01:40.431
you say, " You want me
to lick your balls, Daddy?"

01:40.533 --> 01:43.161
Pressure on the seizure program
is only gonna get more intense...

01:43.269 --> 01:45.737
and when it does, that shit is gonna rise
straight to the surface.

01:45.839 --> 01:49.104
- Find the leak.
- This surveillance tape's
from Shane's car last night.

01:49.209 --> 01:52.406
How would you like to get that
little girl's body back? Body for a body.

01:52.512 --> 01:55.072
- Who?
- Vic Mackey.

01:55.181 --> 01:58.412
His body for hers.
Let me know when it's done.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.679
- What's the matter with you?
- Bugged your car.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.017
/t's you or me, right?

02:03.123 --> 02:06.820
Antwon killed Angie right in front
of me and Army. He did it with our guns.

02:06.926 --> 02:09.223
He's squeezing us.
Will you help me?

02:09.329 --> 02:11.160
You had a gun to his head.
He's gonna tell you anything you want.

02:11.264 --> 02:13.061
He was never comin' after me.
Trust me.

02:13.166 --> 02:16.397
Be advised. We have two officers
unaccounted for. Requesting a tac alert.

02:16.503 --> 02:19.995
- Captain- I mean, Councilman.
- It's just officer tonight.

02:20.106 --> 02:23.564
- Oh, Jesus!
- Somebody's certainly making his point.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.644
Antwon Mitchell's
hit the hardest.

02:25.745 --> 02:28.543
Once we have the girl's body,
Antwon doesn't have any more leverage.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.775
We dig her up,
extract our bullets-

02:30.884 --> 02:34.684
- [Groaning]
- Pitarrio, you did something
for Mitchell. What was it?

02:34.787 --> 02:36.880
- Antwon told me to move a body.
- Cops?

02:36.990 --> 02:39.686
- I think it was a girl.
- Where?

02:39.792 --> 02:41.350
Griffith Park, man-
by the horses.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.725
Captain's arranged
a welcome wagon for Antwon.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.957
How long you think it's gonna take him
to point a finger at me and Army?

02:46.065 --> 02:48.625
I'll make sure it takes long enough
for us to get our leverage back.

02:48.735 --> 02:52.569
- So what's your captain
gonna sweat me on, huh?
- I'll be in the room.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.800
I'll steer the questioning
away from anything sensitive-

02:55.909 --> 02:57.774
that is, if we're workin' together.

02:57.877 --> 03:02.177
- We can only hold him 12 hours.
- She's buried in Griffith Park, near the horses...

03:02.282 --> 03:03.977
- in three holes.
- Christ.

03:04.083 --> 03:08.179
- Don't know what we're gonna throw at him yet.
- I have a couple aces.

03:08.288 --> 03:10.085
Thanks for coming in, Antwon.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.084
- [Footsteps Approaching]
- [Owl Hooting /n Distance]

03:19.999 --> 03:22.524
[Curtis] So, how big's this rock
we're looking for anyway?

03:22.635 --> 03:25.297
[Shane] /t's big, man.
/t's landmark-like.

03:27.006 --> 03:31.033
- [Ronnie Grunts] Nothing.
- [Army] Me either.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.005
Are we sure that's
the stables back there?

03:36.115 --> 03:38.879
/ got the horseshit
on my shoes to prove it.

03:38.985 --> 03:42.352
[Shane] Pitarrio said the girl's body's buried
200 yards south of the horses.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.923
- [Army] Which way's south?
- [Ronnie] We are south.

03:45.024 --> 03:47.458
This is supposed
to be the place.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.120
[Shane] / don't know.
This doesn't feel right.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.166
- [Curtis]Jesus Christ. This is bullshit.
- You got something to say?

03:58.271 --> 04:01.365
No, I'm just looking for a dead girl's body
to keep your ass clean.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.533
- You don't want to be here. Don't be.
- /'m not here for you.

04:03.643 --> 04:06.168
- I'm here for her.
- [Horse Whinnies /n Distance]

04:10.650 --> 04:12.880
Couldn't pass up a police escort.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.088
I felt like the mayor of Crackertown.

04:16.189 --> 04:20.125
Enjoy it now. Your next police escort
might not be a round-trip.

04:20.226 --> 04:23.593
- [Door Opens]
- / thought we were being friendly.

04:23.696 --> 04:27.291
Times like this, a community needs
to come together.

04:27.400 --> 04:32.099
Here's the waiver. Says you agree to talk to us
without the presence of an attorney.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.173
Waive my constitutional rights?

04:36.075 --> 04:40.739
Let it be said that Antwon Mitchell
is all about the help.

04:44.717 --> 04:46.912
Who killed our cops?

04:47.020 --> 04:50.387
Way people feeling about y'all these days,
could've been anybody.

04:50.490 --> 04:53.391
You've been speaking out
against the seizures.

04:53.493 --> 04:56.894
Our dead cops were found
in a seized house.

04:56.996 --> 04:59.897
You sure that wasn't
your idea of a protest song?

04:59.999 --> 05:03.366
This may come as a big surprise
to you, but, uh...

05:03.469 --> 05:06.461
there's a lot of shit that goes on
out there I ain't privy to.

05:06.572 --> 05:10.770
That house is in Niner territory.
You're king of the One-niners.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.845
You're telling me
you didn't order the hit.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.273
Hear about it afterwards?

05:16.382 --> 05:20.284
I just got off a plane.
I ain't even been back to the castle yet.

05:20.386 --> 05:24.846
Yeah, that was convenient. Out of town just
long enough for two cops to get murdered.

05:26.025 --> 05:28.459
You know what happens now,
don't you?

05:28.561 --> 05:31.860
Investigation never ends. Ever.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.834
Did you hear about Antwon's son...

05:37.937 --> 05:39.905
Donald III?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.839
- He's in County, isn't he?
- [Murmurs]

05:42.942 --> 05:47.140
Turns out Don's been
a bad boy in lockup.

05:47.246 --> 05:50.477
The surveillance camera caught him
in the bathroom with another inmate.

05:52.251 --> 05:55.015
Guards say that he
wasn't forced.

05:59.325 --> 06:02.761
Did you know that your son
was gay, Antwon?

06:02.862 --> 06:06.764
Ooh, / didn't know your crew was
so friendly with the Mexicans.

06:06.866 --> 06:10.324
Makes me got to wonder what would happen
if I pulled a few strings...

06:10.436 --> 06:14.133
- and had him transferred to Folsom.
- Little Tijuana?

06:17.276 --> 06:21.372
[Chuckles] He'd have
a line of boyfriends outside his cell.

06:21.481 --> 06:24.541
/ want to know
who killed our cops.

06:26.085 --> 06:28.576
When / come back,
you help me with that-

06:28.688 --> 06:32.283
we'll talk about
how I can help your son.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:43.536 --> 06:46.528
I'll take care of that.

06:46.639 --> 06:49.733
- I didn't know about the kid. There's cameras-
- You goddamn busted him.

06:49.842 --> 06:52.140
- Check yourself.
- No.

06:53.713 --> 06:56.181
You better check her.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.282
Don't forget...

07:00.386 --> 07:03.184
I got cards to play here too.

07:09.562 --> 07:12.122
[Door Closes]

07:12.231 --> 07:14.961
[Rock]

07:15.067 --> 07:18.332
[Men, Women Chattering]

07:18.438 --> 07:21.339
[Ends]

07:25.745 --> 07:27.213
If you've got any more bombs to drop,
give me a heads-up now.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.510
If you've got any more bombs to drop,
give me a heads-up now.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.777
- You're doing great.
- I'd do better if you'd let me in on your intel.

07:31.884 --> 07:35.945
No time. We've only got him for 12 hours.
/ want to get back in there.

07:36.055 --> 07:39.149
I don't think that going after
Antwon's family is the best way to-

07:39.258 --> 07:42.887
Somebody killed two of ours.
He knows who.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.328
[Door Opens]

07:55.441 --> 07:58.410
[Sighs]
Who killed our cops?

08:01.113 --> 08:04.708
[Scoffs]
More yearbook photos?

08:10.623 --> 08:13.023
These are the Mexi O.G. 's...

08:13.125 --> 08:15.389
who are running, uh, gen pop at Folsom.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.861
They all have one thing in common.

08:17.964 --> 08:20.524
They want you dead.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.363
Now they've got something else.

08:25.271 --> 08:29.765
[Scoffs]
You some kind of special, lady.

08:29.876 --> 08:33.710
Guess he's gonna have to learn
how to watch his own ass now.

08:33.813 --> 08:37.408
- He ain't my problem.
- [Monica] Oh, / don't believe that.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.782
I bet you're feeling
like a real bad dad...

08:40.886 --> 08:42.787
for not being there
during the wonder years.

08:42.889 --> 08:46.325
I mean, just think, if you
hadn't been away doing time...

08:46.425 --> 08:49.724
maybeJunior wouldn't be
in the pokey doing dick.

08:51.464 --> 08:54.228
I don't want to see anything
happen to your son.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.801
It's bad enough having you
for a father.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.701
So tell me about my cops...

08:59.805 --> 09:02.740
and Donald will stay
right where he is.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.777
You ain't got much regard
for a man's family, do you?

09:05.878 --> 09:09.211
- I don't think much of you.
- I wasn't talking about me.

09:09.315 --> 09:12.978
/ was talking about Rich Nelson.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.679
You used to work together, right?

09:15.788 --> 09:17.756
Way back when.

09:17.857 --> 09:21.793
- This ain't about history, jerk-off.
- It's all about history.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.330
Couldn't have had much respect
for his wife and kids either-

09:25.431 --> 09:28.730
- you screwing him and all.
- I said, shut your face.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.462
She ain't the only one
that went to the library.

09:35.207 --> 09:38.005
Don't you want to hear
my book report?

09:38.110 --> 09:41.011
Say what you gotta say.

09:41.113 --> 09:43.911
When I was away...

09:44.016 --> 09:46.644
I heard that you and Rich had a thing.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.983
But / guess it didn't work out.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.684
He went back home
to his unhappy family...

09:53.793 --> 09:55.852
got the cancer...

09:55.962 --> 09:59.659
and you moved on to take care
of mamas and their babies.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.665
Now look at you.

10:02.902 --> 10:07.737
Threatening to have my son
raped and killed.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.968
How'd your old boyfriend
like the new you, huh?

10:11.077 --> 10:13.807
Oh, he'd like me fine.

10:13.913 --> 10:17.041
He had you put away, remember?

10:17.149 --> 10:19.674
Oh, yeah, but /'m back now...

10:19.785 --> 10:23.915
and he's long dead gone.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.362
Get me a cup of water.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.431
Room temperature.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.262
This ain't it. The body's not here.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.499
The ground was torn up, man.
/ mean, you saw it.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.734
[Army]
By a mountain lion or something.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.970
We're west of the stables.
The body's supposed to be south.

10:46.078 --> 10:48.945
- [Sighs] This is where the rock is.
- Know what? I'm calling Vic.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.710
He's got his hands full keeping
Antwon and Monica under control.

10:51.817 --> 10:55.344
Instead of locking Antwon up. That shit's on you,
like all this other stuff.

10:55.454 --> 10:58.116
- Why'd you bring him into this?
- Vic did that.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.715
Probably wanted someone around
wasn't thinking about killing him.

11:00.826 --> 11:04.785
- I never would have done that.
- We'll never know, 'cause Vic
got the drop on you first.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.865
[Shovel Clatters]

11:08.834 --> 11:10.802
Screw him.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.706
- We can rule this guy out.
- What's the latest?

11:14.807 --> 11:17.105
We're still following up
on the stolen J.P. necklace.

11:17.209 --> 11:20.838
- Pulled these from Gang Central.
- We went all the way back to '98. Slim pickings.

11:20.946 --> 11:23.210
Team's cleared
over 60 people so far.

11:23.315 --> 11:26.409
Tips keep comin'. Two cops dead,
everybody wants a taste of the action.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.977
No one's taking the claim?
Bragging to their buddies in the street?

11:30.089 --> 11:32.751
Not yet.
Your best lead's upstairs.

11:32.858 --> 11:37.295
For now, uh, Billings is gonna take the lead
on, uh, Scooby and Carl.

11:37.396 --> 11:40.297
- [Dutch] You can't take us off this-
- Just temporarily.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.697
Kleavon Gardner...

11:42.802 --> 11:46.898
your possible serial killer from San Antonio-
You know this guy.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.304
- What happened?
- Young female, black...

11:49.408 --> 11:52.969
was grabbed on DuPont and strangled
in the vacant lot in Houseman.

11:53.079 --> 11:57.140
A couple interrupted the attack,
but she died on the way to Mission Cross.

11:57.249 --> 12:00.480
- How'd we get onto my friend?
- He was seen in the area.

12:00.586 --> 12:03.419
A couple gave a description close enough,
so unis are bringing them in.

12:03.522 --> 12:06.013
We close Kleavon, you move us
back to Carl and Scooby?

12:06.125 --> 12:08.093
Maybe I can solve that
while you solve this.

12:08.194 --> 12:12.153
- Looks like we've got him this time.
- Yeah, one victim too late.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.466
You've got Antwon Mitchell upstairs?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.004
What's his connection with
the gun supplier you arrested?

12:20.106 --> 12:24.008
- It's not clear yet.
- But they're both involved
in Carl and Scooby's murders?

12:24.110 --> 12:26.806
Yeah, I'd rather not discuss it
till we know more.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.278
Oh, so you announce
you have your guy...

12:29.381 --> 12:31.906
keep the streets quiet until
you get a lead on the real thing.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.210
Smart call.

12:35.321 --> 12:39.052
- You look terrible.
- Thanks. So do you.

12:39.158 --> 12:42.286
You should go home,
get some sleep.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.521
- So should you.
- [Laughs]

12:44.630 --> 12:46.655
Thanks for your help.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.196
/s Antwon keeping his mouth shut?

12:52.304 --> 12:54.829
[Exhales]
Captain's pushing him pretty hard.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.738
Meaning he's about
to start pushing back?

12:57.843 --> 13:01.335
And all we got is a rock in the middle
of a pretty damn big woods.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.075
Department's got a metal detector.

13:04.183 --> 13:08.210
The girl was buried with, uh,
earrings, a belt buckle-

13:08.320 --> 13:10.914
- It'll pick that up.
- Or Shane's bullets?

13:11.023 --> 13:13.617
I don't know.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.388
Look- Maybe we should just
step away from this thing.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.725
- You mean away from Shane.
- /f / gotta choose...

13:18.831 --> 13:21.231
between taking down Antwon
and covering for Shane-

13:21.333 --> 13:23.995
- We're not there yet.
- You and I have both been living straight...

13:24.103 --> 13:26.003
and now we're in deeper than ever
because of him.

13:26.105 --> 13:29.438
/f we hadn't allowed ourselves to get pulled apart,
stopped looking out for each other...

13:29.542 --> 13:32.010
Shane wouldn't have been in this mess.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.579
/t's time for us to turn that around.

13:36.415 --> 13:38.576
Like it or not, Shane's family.

13:47.893 --> 13:50.123
[Door Closes]

13:53.399 --> 13:57.165
- You goin' home?
- Yeah.

13:59.038 --> 14:01.529
Hey, nice gettin' shot at
with you today.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.200
[Pills Clattering]

14:05.845 --> 14:09.747
Maybe next time two cops get murdered,
we'll be paired up again.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.511
Maybe.

14:16.622 --> 14:20.752
Hey, could be worse. Could be Carl and Scooby
making bad jokes about us.

14:32.137 --> 14:34.469
You found them, huh?

14:34.573 --> 14:36.473
[Whispers]
Yeah.

14:36.575 --> 14:38.543
Did they, um-

14:40.746 --> 14:43.340
- You know, were they-
- I don't think they suffered much.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.749
Really?

14:46.852 --> 14:49.320
/ heard it was pretty bad.

14:53.759 --> 14:56.489
They had each been stabbed
several times.

14:58.464 --> 15:01.262
But they had been moved
from another scene...

15:01.367 --> 15:03.358
so the blood was minimal.

15:03.469 --> 15:06.370
You know what? On second thought,
I don't want to know.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.973
Yeah.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.975
Me either.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.372
- [Zipper Zipping]
- Thanks for riding with me.

15:20.452 --> 15:23.649
- [Locker Door Closes]
- [Sniffs] You're lucky, you know?

15:25.724 --> 15:28.887
You got family at home, waiting for you
to walk through the door.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.931
Take care, Danny.

15:36.368 --> 15:39.826
[Door Opens, Closes]

15:42.574 --> 15:46.101
- About time.
- Who killed our cops?

15:49.882 --> 15:54.285
Donald gets transferred out to Folsom next
Tuesday. I suggest you arrange a visit...

15:54.386 --> 15:56.286
to say good-bye.

15:57.656 --> 16:00.147
And I suggest you come down
out of that tower, ivory.

16:00.259 --> 16:04.719
We all just taking a run at something feels better,
using the power in our hands.

16:04.830 --> 16:07.958
Rich Nelson-
He was using his power.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.695
Screwing you wasn't his only
indiscretion, was it?

16:10.803 --> 16:14.967
He planted that blow in my car
and trumped up those trafficking charges...

16:15.074 --> 16:18.237
becausejust like you all,
he had shit on me.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.244
You had to know it.

16:20.346 --> 16:23.076
Your boyfriend-
He cheated that evidence.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.412
So what does that
make him, huh?

16:25.517 --> 16:28.486
- You, for knowing?
- Do you want to talk about indiscretions?

16:29.521 --> 16:32.354
Secrets in the dark?

16:32.458 --> 16:37.259
How about when you were
a kid- 13, 14-

16:37.363 --> 16:40.332
fat, not very popular...

16:40.432 --> 16:45.028
burying your head under the covers
to drown out the screams of your baby sister?

16:45.137 --> 16:48.629
Your six-year-old sister
that your daddy raped...

16:48.741 --> 16:51.608
night after night.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.610
And you couldn't stop it,
could you?

16:53.712 --> 16:56.647
Too much of a coward to confront
your old man, but not your mama.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.946
She emptied two loads
of buckshot into his gut.

17:00.052 --> 17:04.113
So Daddy's dead, baby sister's
in the psych ward, and your mama?

17:04.223 --> 17:06.714
She's doing life in Chino...

17:06.825 --> 17:09.385
all because you couldn't
come out from under the covers.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.588
But, oh, boy, you're
making up for it now.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.494
Oh, yeah, you're street tough.
You're a gangster...

17:14.599 --> 17:17.228
full of cop-killing rage.

17:17.336 --> 17:21.271
But you're still too much of a coward
to even save your own son.

17:27.479 --> 17:29.379
Cuff him.

17:37.656 --> 17:39.624
End this now, man.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.956
Give us a name,
somewhere we can look.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.888
Maybe you ought
to take this out there...

17:48.434 --> 17:50.493
ask around your own house.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.093
What the hell
does that mean?

17:53.205 --> 17:56.333
Heard a lot of street chatter about
a little girl, got herself killed...

17:56.442 --> 17:59.138
because she was tangled up
with a dirty cop.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.451
/f / heard it, maybe the murdered cops
heard it too...

18:07.553 --> 18:09.680
got dead 'cause of it.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.190
[Mackey]
Bullshit.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.192
For you to figure out.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.063
In the meantime...

18:19.164 --> 18:21.724
I want my lawyer.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.200
Now.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.932
[Scoffs]

18:30.075 --> 18:34.102
Hey, Julien. Watch commander
wants us to cover the cage tonight.

18:34.213 --> 18:36.943
Won't be able
to sleep anyway.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.142
I'll let Vanessa know.

18:39.251 --> 18:42.414
/ saw Carl's wife before.
How's she doin'?

18:42.521 --> 18:44.250
She's upset.

18:44.356 --> 18:47.325
She's thinking about
suing the department.

18:47.426 --> 18:50.259
- You're kidding.
- This didn't have to happen.

18:50.362 --> 18:52.728
She sees that.

18:52.831 --> 18:54.856
She sees that,
or you put it in her head?

18:56.001 --> 18:57.901
It wasn't like that.

18:58.003 --> 19:01.632
Okay, I'll be in the cage.
Take your time gettin' there.

19:01.740 --> 19:05.471
You saw a black male- 30s-
running from the scene?

19:05.577 --> 19:09.172
- He was about six feet, wearing jeans.
- No. He was wearing a tracksuit.

19:09.281 --> 19:12.842
- [Man] Since when's a tracksuit made of denim?
- Don't tell me what I saw.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.715
Can you describe anything else?
Hair? Distinguishing marks?

19:15.821 --> 19:18.619
Just your average
shifty-looking black dude.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.624
- No offense.
- Thank you.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.126
He was clean-cut, the kind
you would bring home to Mom.

19:23.228 --> 19:26.129
- At least from a distance.
- Sounds like you want to bone the guy.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.722
- I don't think she meant it that way.
- Trust me. She meant it.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.961
He thinks it's funny
making me feel like shit.

19:31.069 --> 19:33.003
Think you could pick the man
out of a lineup?

19:33.105 --> 19:36.871
- I could. She's useless.
- He's right. / have a terrible
track record picking out men.

19:36.975 --> 19:39.808
[Man] /t's too bad that psycho
didn't cross your path.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.846
[Woman]
Oh, you are-

19:41.947 --> 19:43.209
- [Man] Arrest her.
- Arrest me?

19:43.315 --> 19:45.613
Okay. Let's just calm down.

19:48.453 --> 19:51.047
- If it was me smacking her around,
you'd lock me up!
- Asshole.

19:51.156 --> 19:53.886
- Bitch!
- [Dutch] Okay. Take her away.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.862
This is bullshit.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.090
- He's the one you should arrest.
- Watch your step.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.362
- He's stealing our cable.
- [Danny] Lady, two officers were killed today.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.698
All right? Boosted cable's
just not a priority.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.704
Lookin'good, Trina.
Lookin'real good.

20:07.806 --> 20:09.706
Sir, step away
from the cage. Come on.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.776
How about the stolen car parts
in our garage?

20:11.877 --> 20:14.141
- You think you could make that a priority?
- She's lying.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.714
Real crime is
how small his dick is.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.783
Afraid that one's
not in the penal code.

20:20.886 --> 20:24.117
Then search our garage.
Get him on grand theft.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.248
/'ll give you permission
to search our house.

20:29.595 --> 20:32.120
Dead victim,
no physical evidence...

20:32.231 --> 20:34.995
two witnesses who failed
to pick Kleavon out of a six-pack-

20:35.100 --> 20:37.000
We got nothin'.

20:37.102 --> 20:39.866
Kleavon's logged more hours
in interrogation than the two of us.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.940
If he's guilty...

20:42.040 --> 20:44.600
he's not gonna crack unless
he's under some serious pressure.

20:44.710 --> 20:50.546
Well, the M.E. 's initial report says
that the girl was strangled face-to-face.

20:50.649 --> 20:54.551
- What are you doin'?
- I only have a hundred. I'm getting change.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.356
I need some cash.

21:00.058 --> 21:02.117
For gas.

21:07.399 --> 21:09.959
If Kleavon thinks that girl is alive...

21:10.068 --> 21:12.161
he'd know she could I.D. him.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.171
He might want a deal.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.241
/f we offer one,
he'll smell weakness.

21:16.341 --> 21:19.868
Then we gotta get him to ask for one.
Let me get a run at it.

21:19.978 --> 21:22.640
- He's got a thing for us black girls.
- [Scoffs]

21:27.185 --> 21:30.416
Young woman was rushed
to Mission Cross for surgery.

21:30.522 --> 21:33.514
They say she's a fighter.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.525
50-50 she makes it.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.289
Glad to hear it.

21:38.397 --> 21:40.831
Sloppy work.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.230
Not by me.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.428
You're jittery.

21:45.537 --> 21:48.335

when she comes to?

21:48.440 --> 21:51.238
Why should / be?
/ was home watching the game.

21:51.343 --> 21:53.243
- Ask my sister.
- I will.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.870
Then do it.
Let me out of here.

21:55.981 --> 22:00.714
Last time you were here,
you were so calm 'cause you were innocent.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.923
- What's different about tonight?
- Out of patience.

22:06.024 --> 22:09.323
Seems like every time somebody shits
around here, y'all smell my ass.

22:09.428 --> 22:13.159
Witnesses put you at the scene.
You sure you didn't leave your house?

22:13.265 --> 22:15.893
- I went out for soda.
- You changed your story.

22:17.803 --> 22:21.239
You were watchin' the game,
or you went out-Which is it?

22:22.641 --> 22:25.075
/ never been arrested.

never on probation.

Come and go as I please.

22:31.316 --> 22:34.217
Look, /'m sorry that girl
got her neck wrung...

22:34.319 --> 22:36.287
but it ain't my problem.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.719
He wasn't gone long,
not more than five, 10 minutes.

22:41.827 --> 22:44.921
Barely long enough
to get the sodas.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.488
We have two witnesses who saw him
attack this girl. They chased him off.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.500
They're wrong.

22:50.602 --> 22:54.595
He has a habit of being in the vicinity
of murdered black girls.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.174
That's what
the San Antonio police said...

22:57.275 --> 22:59.903
and they've convinced you
of the same thing.

23:00.011 --> 23:02.809
I know it's hard to believe
this of your own brother.

23:02.914 --> 23:04.973
[Woman]
Kleavon is not a killer.

23:05.083 --> 23:08.712
If he was- I'm his sister.
Believe me, I'd know it.

23:08.820 --> 23:13.689
We had a woman in here last year
whose husband was a serial rapist.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.692
She had no idea.

23:15.794 --> 23:20.925
He said he was at work. Even took a job
that, uh, suited his other career.

23:21.032 --> 23:24.593
/ don't think she really even
believed it when he confessed.

23:24.703 --> 23:26.933
Then I'll pray for her.

23:27.038 --> 23:29.700
But Kleavon was home with me.

23:29.808 --> 23:32.402
He left for only a few minutes.

23:33.779 --> 23:37.806
/s that enough time
for him to get the sodas...

23:37.916 --> 23:40.214

he doesn't even know...

23:40.318 --> 23:42.946

and strangle her?

/s it?

- [Sara] Nice place.

24:04.409 --> 24:07.242
What are we doing here?

24:07.345 --> 24:09.313
I was driving by. It felt right.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.983
After last time, I think we need
to go over the rules again.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.814
No bruising, no ripping out hair.

24:21.426 --> 24:24.725
When I say stop, stop.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.071
I heard on the news
about those two cops.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.379
Died in the bottom
of some sewer.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.281
Assholes overpowered them.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.717
[Sighs, Chuckles]

24:53.291 --> 24:55.259
Let me make you feel better.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.956
I don't want to feel better.

25:06.037 --> 25:08.005
My client and I need
to speak in private.

25:08.106 --> 25:10.472
/'m surprised your client
can afford your services.

25:10.575 --> 25:14.136
From ex-con to millionaire
rec center owner-That's quite a leap.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.876
Earn your 500 an hour, ass-wipe.

25:20.752 --> 25:22.777
Let me know when they're done.

25:24.322 --> 25:26.290
Will do.

25:30.228 --> 25:32.719
They can only hold you
six more hours.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.459
No reason to say
one word more.

25:35.567 --> 25:38.536
I need you to do me a favor
while I'm stuck here.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.629
- What?
- Cover that camera first.

25:41.740 --> 25:45.301
Our conversations are privileged.
They're not allowed to watch.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.746
Humor me, Tom.

25:55.086 --> 25:57.384
[Antwon]
Call Bobcat.

25:57.489 --> 26:01.823
Tell him it's time to let the police
find that girl.

26:01.927 --> 26:04.054
- [Tom] / don't want to hear anymore.
- [Antwon] Fine.

26:04.162 --> 26:07.029
- [People Laughing]
- Just get him the message.

26:15.607 --> 26:19.737
- What? What now?
- Pitarrio- He screwed us, man.

26:19.844 --> 26:24.474
We've been north, south, east,
west of those damn stables.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.050
What?

26:26.151 --> 26:28.984
Captain's been digging
into Donald III.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.987
Antwon's kid?

26:31.089 --> 26:35.150
Turns out the kid's a come burper,
grabbing his ankles for Mexi inmates.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.251
Sent Antwon over the edge.

26:37.362 --> 26:40.593
He's got his piece-of-shit mouthpiece
setting things into motion.

26:40.699 --> 26:43.862
- He's dropping the body?
- Anonymous tip could come in anytime.

26:43.969 --> 26:46.733
Okay, uh-

26:46.838 --> 26:48.738
Okay, we gotta go back to Pitarrio.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.276
Have him be real damn clear this time
where Angie's body is.

26:52.377 --> 26:54.811
Split up. One to his place,
one to the recycling center.

26:54.913 --> 26:57.279
Uh, recycling center-
It's on Lexington.

26:57.382 --> 26:59.680
- There are four of them.
- Forget it. You take the cut house?

26:59.784 --> 27:02.651
Get some collateral this time,
so we know he's telling the truth.

27:02.754 --> 27:04.688
- Okay.
- Hey.

27:04.789 --> 27:07.417
- We still got time.
- Yeah, all right.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.565
[Door Closes]

27:15.734 --> 27:18.601
[Gasping]
Please! No!

27:18.703 --> 27:21.968
No! No! No.

27:22.073 --> 27:25.736
[Crying]
Please. Don't.

27:25.844 --> 27:28.938
Don't.
[Gasping]

27:29.047 --> 27:31.242
Come here.
Get on your knees.

27:31.349 --> 27:34.614
- Not so hard.
- Huh?

27:34.719 --> 27:37.085
- Open up, sweetheart.
- I said, not so hard.

27:37.188 --> 27:39.748
[Grunting]

27:39.858 --> 27:42.554
[Gasping]

27:42.661 --> 27:44.720
- Let me see that pretty mouth, huh?
- Stop!

27:44.829 --> 27:48.060
Ever suck a dick, huh?
Like a cell bitch?

27:48.166 --> 27:50.031
- Huh?
- I said, stop it!

27:50.135 --> 27:53.070
[Grunts, Gasps]

27:53.171 --> 27:55.139
[Panting]

28:10.221 --> 28:12.849
Did somebody do that to you-

28:12.957 --> 28:15.653
- put a gun at your head?
- Shut up.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.593
Just-

28:18.697 --> 28:20.892
[Gasping]

28:23.868 --> 28:26.860
[Retching]

28:29.474 --> 28:31.942
[Spits, Gasps]

28:32.043 --> 28:34.443
Look, whoever did...

28:34.546 --> 28:36.707
whatever to you-

28:38.249 --> 28:40.683
You didn't know they wouldn't
pull the trigger.

28:42.153 --> 28:44.121
You probably knew they would.

28:45.356 --> 28:47.381
/f you fought it, you'd be dead.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.187
/t's not your fault.

28:54.299 --> 28:57.200
You're not like that.

28:57.302 --> 28:59.270
You're a good person.

29:00.972 --> 29:04.271
A good person wouldn't
be here with you.

29:07.612 --> 29:09.671
I don't want to ever
see you again.

29:11.182 --> 29:13.082
Get out.

29:15.186 --> 29:17.484
/ said, get out.

29:17.589 --> 29:21.047
Get out.
[Panting]

29:24.262 --> 29:26.423
Leave.

29:28.399 --> 29:31.562
- [Door Opens, Closes]
- [Sighs]

29:33.671 --> 29:36.299
Your sister says you were gone
about half an hour.

29:36.407 --> 29:38.432
No. She knows it was
five, 10 minutes.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.943
Her statement puts
your alibi in jeopardy.

29:41.045 --> 29:45.505
Those Texas boys were good at locking up
their colored folks on bullshit charges.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.677
- Somehow I don't think you two
run the same scam.
- /f you needed soda...

29:48.787 --> 29:50.755
there was a convenience store
two blocks away...

29:50.855 --> 29:53.983
but you went a half a mile further
to a more expensive supermarket?

29:54.092 --> 29:56.458
That convenience store
don't always stock my drink.

29:56.561 --> 29:59.394
I didn't want to miss the game,
so I just went straight to the market.

29:59.497 --> 30:01.897
The same grocery
near the victim's bus stop.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.733
She passes it every Tuesday and Thursday
on her way home from teaching night school.

30:06.838 --> 30:09.568
But you've been stalkin' her for weeks,
haven't you?

30:09.674 --> 30:12.074
No, sir.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.911
Our witnesses are here.

30:21.886 --> 30:24.047
Ready to stand in the lineup?

30:27.025 --> 30:29.323
That's him, Officer.

30:35.033 --> 30:37.593
[Claudette]
Number four...

30:37.702 --> 30:40.330
you're out of luck.

30:42.106 --> 30:45.906
Dutch, you ready with
that second witness?

30:47.078 --> 30:48.978
Four, keep your number up.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.615
[Latin]

31:04.329 --> 31:06.957
Psst. Put your hands up.

31:07.065 --> 31:09.329
- Shh.
- You want Pitarrio?

31:09.434 --> 31:11.334
- Yeah, Pitarrio.
- Good.

31:11.436 --> 31:14.064
- I got too much to do today to get hauled in.
- Shh.

31:14.172 --> 31:16.800
- Put your hands down.
- He's in the other room.

31:16.908 --> 31:18.808
All right. Let's go.

31:18.910 --> 31:20.878
Shut up.
Keep it down.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.276
- [Continues]
- All right. Go on. Get out ofhere.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.510
[Thuds]

31:27.619 --> 31:30.053
Go.

31:33.124 --> 31:35.183
- Mmm. Shit!
- Get up!

31:35.293 --> 31:37.261
- Who are you?
- You met my friends yesterday.

31:37.362 --> 31:40.525
- Asked about a little girl's body you buried.
- I told them.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.896
Directions didn't work out.
Try again. No bullshit this time.

31:43.001 --> 31:45.970
- South of the horses, man.
- You like lying about dead girls...

31:46.070 --> 31:49.631
- as much as you like burying them?
- Screw you- [Grunts]

31:49.741 --> 31:53.472
[Curtis]
Goddamn it! Shit.

31:55.813 --> 31:57.781
Wipe it up.

31:57.882 --> 32:01.818
Look, you tell me where the girl's buried,
and do not say the stables.

32:02.954 --> 32:05.320
- What stables?
- You said the stables.

32:05.423 --> 32:09.621
No. No, horses, man.
That go up and down?

32:09.727 --> 32:12.924
- The m-The merry-go-round?
- Yeah.

32:13.031 --> 32:16.797
The goddamn
merry-go-round! Christ.

32:16.901 --> 32:19.870
- Where's your stash? Where's your stash?
- Ain't got no stash.

32:19.971 --> 32:22.337
How many goddamn teeth
do you want to lose today?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.533
- Where is it?
- It's in there.

32:24.642 --> 32:26.542
Get up. Get your ass up.

32:26.644 --> 32:28.839
- Where?
- It's in there, man.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.915
All right. Don't move.

32:32.183 --> 32:34.378
[Clattering]

32:43.861 --> 32:46.830
We find the dead girl's body,
you get this back.

32:46.931 --> 32:49.092
It's your last chance
to change your story.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.431
200 yards south of the merry-go-round,
by the big rock, man.

33:18.463 --> 33:21.261
Body's by the merry-go-round.

33:21.366 --> 33:24.494
He said horses. He said horses.
So we've been in the wrong spot all night!

33:24.602 --> 33:26.900
- Lem's on the way.
- I'll meet him there.

33:30.975 --> 33:33.466
[Dog Barking /n Distance]

33:41.552 --> 33:43.918
- Good morning.
- You're back.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.930
Hey, sweetie.

33:55.366 --> 33:58.733
- / missed you.
- [Sophia] / missed you too.

34:01.105 --> 34:03.073
Those two officers-

34:06.644 --> 34:08.942
- Did they find out who did it?
- No, not yet.

34:14.118 --> 34:16.313
[Sighs]
It was a long night.

34:19.590 --> 34:24.219
The drywall guy's coming today. Can you
leave a check before you go into the office?

34:24.328 --> 34:26.295
Sure.

34:30.868 --> 34:32.835
Actually I was, uh-

34:34.272 --> 34:36.331
/ was thinking maybe
/ wouldn't go in today.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.308
Maybe we could take Sophia
to the beach.

34:39.409 --> 34:42.538
Oh, I don't want to get her
off her preschool schedule.

34:47.118 --> 34:49.018
I found them.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.152
Stabbed, tortured.

34:54.257 --> 34:56.158
[Gasps]

34:56.260 --> 34:58.160
Jesus, David.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.028
We should try and do something
for their families.

35:07.638 --> 35:09.868
I'm sorry.

35:09.974 --> 35:11.874
For everything.

35:16.881 --> 35:20.544
l- I've made mistakes,
trying to get out of this hole.

35:20.651 --> 35:23.119
Okay, please don't.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.348
Just don't.

35:27.291 --> 35:30.590
Those two men,
lying on that ground-

35:30.695 --> 35:34.392
/ don't want to spend another day
losing you and Sophia.

35:36.067 --> 35:39.161
I spent the whole night worried
something happened to you.

35:40.304 --> 35:42.704
- You didn't even call.
- I know. l-

35:44.175 --> 35:46.268
I'll change things.

35:46.377 --> 35:48.675
I'll get better.

35:48.779 --> 35:51.213
It's over.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.215
I swear.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.683
It's over.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.860
[Gasps]

36:04.162 --> 36:06.130
[Gasps]

36:15.006 --> 36:17.804
- I swear to God.
- [Sniffles]

36:22.547 --> 36:24.515
Oh, shit.

36:24.615 --> 36:27.083
[Chattering On Police Radio]

36:28.886 --> 36:31.980
[Ronnie] There's overturned dirt
about a hundred yards back.

36:32.089 --> 36:35.024
Andjust as we started digging,
the cops rolled up.

36:35.126 --> 36:38.357
Wetback says horses.
We go to the real goddamn horses. [Laughs]

36:41.699 --> 36:44.668
- What do you think, an hour
before they find that body?
- I don't know.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.964
Sorry, man.
We tried our best.

36:51.475 --> 36:53.443
Yeah.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.755
Two witnesses,
two different lineups-

37:12.863 --> 37:14.831
They both went right for ya.

37:16.867 --> 37:19.233
Your witnesses-They're white?

37:20.671 --> 37:22.195
Figured.

37:22.306 --> 37:25.002
You know witness I.D.'s across race lines
don't hold up in court.

37:25.109 --> 37:28.169
- You're a D.A. now, huh?
- Something I read once.

37:28.279 --> 37:31.339
Whitey think we all look the same.
Isn't it true?

37:31.449 --> 37:34.441
Same as us not knowing
one Chinaman from another.

37:34.552 --> 37:39.182
The word of two white people
against one black man-

37:39.290 --> 37:41.315
Isn't that enough for any jury?

37:44.295 --> 37:47.856
Not this time. I wasn't there.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.634
The doctors at Mission Cross called.

37:52.737 --> 37:56.173
- The victim came to.
- She I.D.'d your brother as her assailant.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.242
It's got to be a mistake.

37:58.342 --> 38:00.469
You go to church regularly?

38:00.578 --> 38:02.944
Every Sunday.
Never miss a service.

38:03.047 --> 38:06.414
You said your brother left at 8:00,
came back 10 minutes later.

38:06.517 --> 38:08.417
Five to 10.

38:08.519 --> 38:12.455
Would you be willing to put your hand
on the Bible in court...

38:12.556 --> 38:14.456
and swear to God on it?

38:16.994 --> 38:19.360
Maybe it wasn't exactly 10 minutes...

38:19.463 --> 38:21.829
but it didn't seem like much longer.

38:28.673 --> 38:31.141
My goddamn card is in her pocket.

38:31.242 --> 38:34.939
I mean, how long you think it's gonna take
for the captain to come straight at me?

38:35.046 --> 38:37.480
About five minutes
before she comes at me.

38:37.581 --> 38:40.141
- [Mackey] They haven't found the body yet.
- [Curtis] As far as we know.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.583
- Goddamn it.
- [Shane] Look, man.

38:42.687 --> 38:45.417
/'ve been involved in shootings.

38:45.523 --> 38:48.651
My ballistics are on record.
Yours aren't.

38:48.759 --> 38:52.627
Maybe you swap out your gun.
You can get out of this.

38:52.730 --> 38:55.221
Yeah, they gotta bring the body
to the coroner.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.824
We can't get in there during the day,
but maybe tonight-

38:57.935 --> 39:00.495
Come on, man. Come on.
That's bullshit, and you know it.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.970
Cameras all over the place.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.807
Look, someone say it.
/'m goin'away.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.612
We're gonna think of something.

39:16.587 --> 39:20.148
Me going to jail and Antwon walking
out of here-That's not gonna happen.

39:22.126 --> 39:24.560
I saw him shoot that little girl
four times.

39:24.662 --> 39:28.894
So if /'m gonna go tojail for murder,
it may as well be for his.

39:28.999 --> 39:32.491
- Don't be a dumb shit.
- He killed Angie. Probably our two cops.

39:32.603 --> 39:34.935
This guy- He's evil.

39:35.039 --> 39:38.531
/ put a bullet in his brain,
at least there's somejustice.

39:38.642 --> 39:41.770
- We ain't deep enough?
- [Sighs]

39:41.879 --> 39:43.847
They're gonna find that body
any minute.

39:45.616 --> 39:47.641
I won't have another chance.

39:47.752 --> 39:49.617
- No.
- This is my mess.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.416
[Sighs] You guys did everything
that you could for me...

39:52.523 --> 39:54.821
and / appreciate it, but, uh...

39:56.193 --> 39:58.593
it's time for me to take care
of business myself.

39:58.696 --> 40:01.859
We're not giving up to this guy.
Not to this guy.

40:01.966 --> 40:04.196
- Let him do it.
- Shut up.

40:04.301 --> 40:06.997
Well, Antwon's a problem
Shane can make go away.

40:07.104 --> 40:09.629
Putting himself on the line
to protect us-

40:09.740 --> 40:12.208
Make sure Mitchell
gets what he deserves-

40:13.577 --> 40:15.772
That's the first good thing
he done in a while.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.678
Now's not the time, Lem.
Let it go.

40:18.783 --> 40:22.549
Aw, come on, man.
Lem's right.

40:22.653 --> 40:24.746
I'm the one who got us
mixed up with Antwon.

40:24.855 --> 40:28.347
/ let him back me into a corner
that / didn't know how to get out of.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.927
Well, now I do.

- Not on that video.

- We've got him on tape soliciting
one cop to kill another cop.
- No.

No. Then it implicates you and Ronnie

out from under Antwon...

that Shane would've left that behind?

to put a bullet into Vic...

before / had a chance.

to hire a lawyer
to sue the department.

is knowing that if people had listened to me...

followed her...

54:51.354 --> 54:53.254
You came at her head-on.

to avoid prints...

55:13.576 --> 55:15.635
needs to pump oxygen to the brain.

55:15.745 --> 55:18.305
Her throat pops.

55:18.415 --> 55:21.111
Her urine splashes the ground.

55:21.217 --> 55:24.050
She cries.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.054
All the fight is gone.

55:28.224 --> 55:32.285
Her eyes roll back in her head.

55:32.395 --> 55:34.363
It's over.

55:36.433 --> 55:38.401
You look into those eyes...

55:39.736 --> 55:41.863
and all you can see is darkness.

55:44.874 --> 55:47.172
And almost immediately,
you feel guilty...

55:48.845 --> 55:50.813
- wrong.
- Shut your mouth.

55:55.618 --> 55:57.586
She told us what you did.

55:59.356 --> 56:01.256
You expect me to believe...

56:01.358 --> 56:03.519
that girl got strangled...

56:03.626 --> 56:07.084
then came out of a coma
pointing a finger at me?

56:08.865 --> 56:11.766
Well, that's what happened.

56:11.868 --> 56:15.497
Is she in a coma, or is she
in surgery? It ain't both.

56:15.605 --> 56:20.907
She was in a coma. She went into surgery
to open an airway to fix her crushed trachea.

56:21.010 --> 56:24.571
Nah. I don't think you two
got your stories straight.

56:24.681 --> 56:27.149
/ think /'ll wait...

56:27.250 --> 56:29.150
visit her at the hospital...

56:29.252 --> 56:32.585
and see if she can point me out.
[Sniffs]

56:36.326 --> 56:39.591
[Antwon On TV] How would you like
to get that little girl's body back-

56:39.696 --> 56:42.756
your bullets and all?

56:42.866 --> 56:45.733
- [Shane] How?
- Trade.

56:45.835 --> 56:47.803
Body for a body.

56:49.472 --> 56:51.440
Who?

56:54.310 --> 56:57.541
[Antwon On TV] Vic Mackey.
His body for hers.

56:57.647 --> 57:00.582
- This is entrapment.
- Good luck on selling that one.

57:00.683 --> 57:04.244
- /t's an illegal recording.
- Camera was placed in
a department issue vehicle.

57:04.354 --> 57:06.117
On my authorization.

57:06.222 --> 57:09.589
The Supreme Court says
that we're golden.

57:09.692 --> 57:12.490
Plus our two officers
are willing to testify...

57:12.595 --> 57:15.428
that you shot Angie Stubbs
with their weapons.

57:15.532 --> 57:17.796
That and a murder-for-hire charge.

57:17.901 --> 57:21.428
Next time you arrange a cop killing,
don't do it in a cop car.

57:25.241 --> 57:27.539
[Antwon Grunting]
Let go.

57:27.644 --> 57:30.044
Don't move.

57:38.321 --> 57:41.722
Do you want to tell us
who killed our two men now?

57:45.829 --> 57:47.854
Death penalty's off the table?

57:47.964 --> 57:49.932
/ go back to Lompoc, right?

57:51.100 --> 57:53.000
My son comin'with me?

57:58.341 --> 58:03.540
You think there's anything I get out here
that I don't get on the inside?

58:03.646 --> 58:07.082
Girls, cold brew-

58:08.351 --> 58:10.251
You saw how I was livin'.

58:10.353 --> 58:12.514
Life for me won't change.

58:12.622 --> 58:14.715
Well, it'll be
different enough for us.

58:19.195 --> 58:21.220
Who killed our two cops?

58:23.766 --> 58:25.734
I don't know.

58:27.136 --> 58:29.866
Who has their guns and radios?

58:29.973 --> 58:31.873
Don't know.

58:31.975 --> 58:34.341
This deal is no good
unless you give us everything.

58:34.444 --> 58:37.038
Look, / told you
/ killed the girl.

58:37.146 --> 58:40.582
Bang, bang.
The bitch deserved it.

58:40.683 --> 58:42.583
Put a hit out on Mackey.

58:42.685 --> 58:46.246
But / ain't had nothing to do with two dead cops.
You barking up the wrong tree with that one.

58:47.423 --> 58:49.448
And while we're
on the subject of truth...

58:49.559 --> 58:51.459
you ought to know something.

58:52.695 --> 58:56.256
Vendrell and that burrito boy
he rolls with-

58:56.366 --> 58:58.994
They were dirty way before
I got anything on them.

59:01.404 --> 59:03.770
So you can tell them
I'll see 'em on the inside.

59:05.341 --> 59:09.243
[Chuckling]

59:17.153 --> 59:20.953
It's bullshit. He's just trying to take down
as many of us as he can.

59:22.926 --> 59:24.826
You gonna let him have his way?

59:27.130 --> 59:29.360
If they pass the lie detector,
they'll be fine.

59:31.501 --> 59:33.401
[Door Opens]

59:40.510 --> 59:44.571
We're releasing your brother.
The girl's dead.

59:44.681 --> 59:46.808
Deep down you know we're right.

59:46.916 --> 59:49.942
There's something wrong with him.
You just don't want to see it.

59:50.053 --> 59:53.511
But now that you know,
things will add up.

59:53.623 --> 59:56.421
If I'm living with a killer...

59:58.361 --> 01:00:01.159
why hasn't he killed me?

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.232
He feels safe with you.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.767
You've never suspected him.

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:11.166
So what do I do now?

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:14.072
Just act as if everything's normal.

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:17.278
But be careful.

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.615
Fatima.

01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:38.592
- She's scared.
- Good.

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.931
Her first sleepless night...

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:43.665
- we'll be her first call.
- [Door Closes]

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:51.276
Money jar's gone.
Someone took it.

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:54.179
I guess someone has a problem
with the idea of suing the department.

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:56.945
Excuse us.
We're ready to go.

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:59.146
We worked it all out.
We'd like to drop the charges.

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:02.816
Well, you can just express
your undying affection to thejudge.

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:06.292
- You're not lettin' us go?
- Not till the van shows up
to take you downtown.

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:09.194
- Asshole.
- Bitch.

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:29.841
Captain showed Mitchell
our little home video.

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:34.150
Got him to confess to soliciting my death
and for killing Angie.

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:36.919
- [Exhales]
- Barely put up a fight.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:39.586
- Hallelujah.
- What about Carl and Scooby?

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:43.393
Didn't give us anything on that one,
but we all get to go home.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.635
Antwon's going tojail.

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.636
But what about the lie detector?

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:51.969
[Chuckles] After what we pulled off today,
polygraph's a piece of cake.

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:54.908
Couple of Vicodin, and you'll have 'em
believin'that you don'tjerk off.

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:58.503
- [Men Laughing]
- Rawling'll back you up.

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:02.778
That and all the backslapping
over gettin'Antwon-

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:06.787
- It's over.
- Free and clear.

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:09.255
Couldn't have gone down better
if we'd planned it.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.928
Thank you.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.321
Look, I know you didn't
want to, but-

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:20.831
Maybe this is just who we are.

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:23.565
- Me too.
- No, it isn't.

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.642
We had a problem.
We came together.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.041
We solved it.
That's who we are.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.740
From now on,
we got nothin'over us.

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.818
We got one thing to do.

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:40.014
Hit the streets, find the bad guys,
show 'em who's in charge.

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.091
Strike-Team style.

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.887
[Mackey] Starting with the pricks
who stabbed Scooby and Carl.

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:48.122
When the time comes, we'll be there
to see 'em get the needle.

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:50.131
/'ll sweat the baby bangers...

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:52.667
threaten to take away their P.S.P.'s
if they hold out on intel.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.669
Well, anybody
that owes me a favor-

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:57.331
I'll just be real damn clear
that it's way past due.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.806
For one, there's gonna be a lot more talkin'
with Antwon gone.

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:03.037
[Shane] / tell you what, man.
This whole thing is gonna shake up the street.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:06.741
Bangers won't know which way to turn.
And then- Bam! There we'll be.

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:09.841
Mackey's coming up clean
the past six months.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.888
You've been through
the seizure files?

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:16.356
Sloppy paperwork,
but it all reads fine.

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:21.922
- How about the evidence room?
- Nothing's missing or out of order.

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:25.364
I've been asking around the street
as much as I can without attracting attention.

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.436
I thought this would be good news.

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:34.238
Stay on Mackey.

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:36.311
All of his guys.

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:38.573
You sure?

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:41.047
I wish I wasn't.

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.385
- [Car Doors Slam]
- Here he comes.

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:48.753
[Mackey]
We got him, fellas.

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:51.725
Guess it's time for you
to lick my balls, Daddy.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.456
Captain's not buying
your tall tales, Antwon.

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:58.727
She bought the one about me
knowing nothing about them dead cops.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.968
You think some shit like that
goes down without my okay?

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:09.042
- Who?
- Who what?

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:12.672
- We're just whispering here.
- Those kind of whispers violate your deal.

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:16.479
Yeah. Not unless
you got 'em on tape.

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:20.517
You'll never find out
who offed them pigs.

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:24.059
I'll go to sleep every night
smiling on that one.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.790
[Laughs] You'll go to sleep every night
in a 6-by-12, asshole.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:30.866
[Man] Let's go.

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:36.205
In the van.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.508
I'll find out who killed our boys...

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:44.341
- and I'm gonna wipe that smile
off his goddamn face.
