REESE: This is stupid.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.589
We didn't do anything.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.007
MALCOLM: What do we need

01:28.630 --> 01:30.007
a psychiatrist for?

01:30.049 --> 01:31.132
I don't want to hear it.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.509
We need professional help.

01:32.551 --> 01:33.635
Hello.

01:33.677 --> 01:34.970
Hi, thanks for

01:33.677 --> 01:34.970
squeezing us in.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.137
Why do we all

01:35.012 --> 01:36.137
have to be here?

01:36.179 --> 01:37.431
He's the one that's

01:36.179 --> 01:37.431
afraid of being

01:37.472 --> 01:38.974
attacked by a shark

01:37.472 --> 01:38.974
in the shower!

01:39.016 --> 01:40.308
At least he doesn't

01:39.016 --> 01:40.308
walk in his sleep

01:40.350 --> 01:41.602
and pee on the TV!

01:41.643 --> 01:43.144
At-at-at-at-at!

01:43.186 --> 01:45.188
My wife told you about the car?

01:45.230 --> 01:47.148
Yes, the joyriding incident.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.150
$700 worth of damage!

01:49.192 --> 01:51.152
Look, we are at our wit's end

01:49.192 --> 01:51.152
with these boys.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.405
I am authorizing you to do

01:51.194 --> 01:53.405
whatever it takes.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.156
Drugs, brainwashing,

01:53.447 --> 01:55.156
electroshock...

01:55.198 --> 01:57.993
Maybe I'll start with

01:55.198 --> 01:57.993
talking to them.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.494
You're the expert.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.790
You do whatever the doctor says.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.626
You better be cured

02:02.831 --> 02:05.626
when I get back.

02:07.044 --> 02:10.255
Well, looks like we have

02:07.044 --> 02:10.255
some work to do, don't we?

02:10.297 --> 02:12.132
Take a seat.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.180
So, let's go over

02:16.845 --> 02:19.180
the ground rules.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.599
This is a safe zone.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.184
What that means is

02:20.641 --> 02:23.184
when one of you talks,

02:23.226 --> 02:25.186
everybody listens

02:25.228 --> 02:29.691
and listening does not include

02:25.228 --> 02:29.691
interrupting, name-calling,

02:29.733 --> 02:32.193
or passing judgment on

02:29.733 --> 02:32.193
what was just said.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.238
That way everybody can say

02:32.235 --> 02:35.238
what they want

02:35.280 --> 02:37.282
and feel okay about it.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.617
Can I have a piece of candy?

02:38.659 --> 02:39.701
No.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.495
This is ridiculous.

02:41.536 --> 02:42.913
We didn't take their car out.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.205
We were watching TV all night.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.582
We were being good.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.043
I mean, I had some stuff

02:45.624 --> 02:48.043
scheduled for later, but...

02:48.085 --> 02:49.419
There was a lot of damage done

02:48.085 --> 02:49.419
to that car.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.504
Somebody else

02:49.461 --> 02:50.504
must have

02:50.545 --> 02:52.213
driven it, 'cause it wasn't us.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.674
Okay, let's back up.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.634
Let's talk about the home.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.719
It's a dump.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.719
There's a leak in the roof

02:57.761 --> 02:59.220
right over my bed.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.515
No, no, I mean I'd like to know

02:59.262 --> 03:01.515
about your family life.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.225
Look, don't analyze us.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.603
You can poke and prod and delve

03:04.267 --> 03:06.603
all you want,

03:06.645 --> 03:09.731
but you're not going to find

03:06.645 --> 03:09.731
any psychological issues, okay?

03:09.773 --> 03:11.232
We're normal!

03:11.274 --> 03:12.901
(drill whirring)

03:12.943 --> 03:14.611
DEWEY (chanting):

03:12.943 --> 03:14.611
I hate my brothers.

03:14.653 --> 03:15.821
I only like me.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.739
I hate my brothers.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.034
I only like me.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.827
I hate my brothers...

03:21.869 --> 03:23.495
(yelling)

03:23.537 --> 03:27.332
Stop it right now!

03:23.537 --> 03:27.332
I mean it!

03:27.374 --> 03:29.084
When are you going to be done?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.836
Soon as I can, honey.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.880
I said stop it!

03:32.921 --> 03:35.090
I hate my brothers.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.675
I only like me.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.635
I hate my brothers.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.512
I only like me.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.181
(drill whirring)

03:45.392 --> 03:50.271
Five Across:

03:45.392 --> 03:50.271
"My Mother the... blank."

03:59.990 --> 04:01.282
What'd you do?

04:01.324 --> 04:02.283
What?

04:02.325 --> 04:04.203
Don't give me that.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.203
What'd you do?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.286
Nothing.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.788
Mom, I'm trying to study.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.207
Oh.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.710
Then I'm sure

04:08.248 --> 04:11.710
you don't mind if I, uh...

04:11.752 --> 04:13.212
took a look in here!

04:14.838 --> 04:15.797
Mom, I'm telling you,

04:15.839 --> 04:17.298
we didn't do anything.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.176
Oh, you boys

04:17.340 --> 04:19.176
are up to something.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.261
I can smell it.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.306
If you've broken another window

04:25.348 --> 04:27.976
it is going to come

04:25.348 --> 04:27.976
out of your...

04:28.018 --> 04:29.144
Are you done?

04:29.186 --> 04:30.311
You want to frisk me?

04:30.353 --> 04:35.316
You just consider

04:30.353 --> 04:35.316
yourselves lucky.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.318
This time.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.835
That was close.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.336
Our only problem is

04:55.378 --> 04:57.338
our parents think we're

04:55.378 --> 04:57.338
lying and we're not.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.382
Hey, a breakthrough.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.343
You're obviously

04:59.424 --> 05:02.343
a very bright young man.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.846
Would you like to spend

05:02.385 --> 05:04.846
the rest of the hour

05:04.888 --> 05:06.765
telling me how bright you are?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.643
Okay, let's talk about

05:07.849 --> 05:09.643
your parents.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.271
Now, if you had to describe them

05:09.684 --> 05:12.271
in a few words,

05:12.312 --> 05:14.314
how would you do that?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.859
I don't know.

05:17.901 --> 05:22.281
Mom is... Mom.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.202
Everybody up!

05:28.495 --> 05:31.372
(screaming)

05:31.414 --> 05:33.292
I have to do laundry

05:31.414 --> 05:33.292
before work!

05:34.417 --> 05:35.836
(groans)

05:35.877 --> 05:38.880
I am taking breakfast off

05:35.877 --> 05:38.880
the table in five minutes!

05:38.922 --> 05:41.382
And Dad's...

05:41.424 --> 05:44.970
What is Dad?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.472
Who wants to make

05:45.012 --> 05:47.472
five bucks?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.683
How?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.683
I need someone to take the fall.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.018
LOIS:

05:49.724 --> 05:51.018
Oh, my God.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.894
What did you do?

05:52.936 --> 05:53.895
I can't tell you.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.438
Yes or no, no questions asked.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.857
LOIS:

05:55.480 --> 05:56.857
Oh, my God!!

05:56.898 --> 05:58.192
Make it ten.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.776
Done.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.278
LOIS:

05:59.818 --> 06:01.278
Oh, my God!

06:01.320 --> 06:02.403
You're a good son.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.404
I got him, honey!

06:03.446 --> 06:05.991
I got him, don't worry!

06:06.033 --> 06:08.785
And you have another brother,

06:06.033 --> 06:08.785
Francis?

06:08.827 --> 06:10.411
Yeah. Did they tell you

06:08.827 --> 06:10.411
what they did to him?

06:10.453 --> 06:12.413
It's a classic firstborn

06:10.453 --> 06:12.413
scenario.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.457
A free and easy couple

06:12.455 --> 06:14.457
suddenly has a kid

06:14.499 --> 06:16.417
and their whole world's

06:14.499 --> 06:16.417
turned upside down,

06:16.459 --> 06:18.128
and even after

06:16.459 --> 06:18.128
there's other kids,

06:18.170 --> 06:19.420
the oldest one

06:18.170 --> 06:19.420
becomes a symbol

06:19.462 --> 06:20.630
for everything that's

06:19.462 --> 06:20.630
wrong in their lives

06:20.672 --> 06:22.799
through no fault

06:20.672 --> 06:22.799
of his own.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.426
Dad, I know what

06:22.841 --> 06:25.426
you're going to say,

06:25.468 --> 06:27.304
and believe me,

06:25.468 --> 06:27.304
I totally agree with you.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.223
There is no excuse

06:27.346 --> 06:29.223
for what I did.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.226
It was idiotic, immature,

06:29.264 --> 06:32.226
totally reckless

06:32.267 --> 06:33.434
and I'm really sorry.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.937
I'm just...

06:33.476 --> 06:35.937
I'm hoping against hope

06:35.979 --> 06:38.439
that you will give me

06:35.979 --> 06:38.439
another chance, which I admit

06:38.481 --> 06:40.067
I don't deserve,

06:40.108 --> 06:42.903
but if you could just find it

06:40.108 --> 06:42.903
in your heart to forgive me,

06:42.944 --> 06:45.364
I know I could

06:42.944 --> 06:45.364
earn your trust back.

06:45.404 --> 06:47.115
(popping, hissing)

06:47.157 --> 06:49.492
They had it out for him

06:47.157 --> 06:49.492
from the start.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.953
Boy, you guys really have a lot

06:49.534 --> 06:51.953
of issues with your parents.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.122
Do you ever discuss any of this

06:51.995 --> 06:54.122
with them?

06:56.333 --> 06:58.960
You never tell your parents

06:56.333 --> 06:58.960
your feelings?

06:59.002 --> 07:00.337
We try. Two weeks ago,

07:00.379 --> 07:02.964
I put some newspapers in

07:00.379 --> 07:02.964
the blender and set it on fire.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.758
That was totally a cry for help.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.301
I mean talk, with words.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.427
You know,

07:06.343 --> 07:08.427
talk about the subject at hand?

07:09.930 --> 07:13.725
You know, a lot of families

07:09.930 --> 07:13.725
do that around the dinner table.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.311
That can be a really good

07:13.767 --> 07:16.311
environment

07:16.353 --> 07:18.479
for sharing your feelings.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.369
Great pancakes, Dad.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.079
Oh, thanks.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.789
Hey, who's ready for seconds?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.082
(hacking)

07:37.124 --> 07:38.833
I am.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.755
Here are the house rules:

07:43.797 --> 07:45.006
You can't reach for seconds

07:45.048 --> 07:46.925
until you're finished with

07:45.048 --> 07:46.925
your firsts

07:46.967 --> 07:48.343
but as soon as anybody's fork

07:48.385 --> 07:50.011
leaves the perimeter of

07:48.385 --> 07:50.011
their plate,

07:50.053 --> 07:51.512
all bets are off.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.648
(metal clanging)

08:13.576 --> 08:15.036
It's mine!

08:15.078 --> 08:16.621
And then there's

08:15.078 --> 08:16.621
a big explosion

08:16.663 --> 08:17.622
and lots of bubbles.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.540
That's where

08:17.664 --> 08:19.540
babies come from.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.626
(laughter)

08:21.668 --> 08:24.545
Oh, well, you know,

08:21.668 --> 08:24.545
close enough.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.839
Look at this.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.424
I made a pea angel.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.134
Oh, you're a pea angel.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.178
Stop playing

08:29.176 --> 08:31.178
with your food.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.805
(laughter)

08:35.515 --> 08:37.642
Oh, Mom...

08:37.684 --> 08:39.060
Don't you dare.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.561
Relax. I wasn't

08:39.102 --> 08:40.561
really going to.

08:40.603 --> 08:41.729
Then don't.

08:41.771 --> 08:42.939
I wasn't going to.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.732
Then don't.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.360
Well, don't accuse me

08:44.774 --> 08:46.360
of something

08:46.401 --> 08:47.610
that I wasn't going to do!

08:49.988 --> 08:51.739
Interesting mood shift.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.575
It would take hours to explain

08:51.781 --> 08:54.575
the psychology behind this

08:54.617 --> 08:56.577
so let me just

08:54.617 --> 08:56.577
put it this way:

08:56.619 --> 08:58.372
Dynamite.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.580
Kid with matches.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.458
You're going to throw that

08:59.622 --> 09:01.458
at Mom?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.084
I wasn't going to!

09:03.126 --> 09:04.585
Geez Louise-- Reese...

09:04.627 --> 09:05.837
Hal, I can handle this.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.507
Reese, I'm warning you.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.800
I wasn't going to,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.800
but if you think I would

09:10.842 --> 09:11.843
then maybe I should.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.970
Oh, good,

09:11.885 --> 09:13.970
now he's panicking.

09:14.012 --> 09:17.224
Just put the spoon down

09:14.012 --> 09:17.224
and apologize.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.600
Okay, she gave him an out.

09:19.642 --> 09:20.768
Apologize for what?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.020
I wasn't going

09:20.810 --> 09:22.020
to do anything!

09:22.062 --> 09:23.397
Just stop talking!

09:23.438 --> 09:24.981
Just stop talking

09:23.438 --> 09:24.981
and let me think!

09:25.023 --> 09:26.525
Dad, do something.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.443
I got it.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.710
What do you think you're doing?

09:45.752 --> 09:48.588
I'm being cute and spontaneous?

09:53.968 --> 09:56.096
(laughing)

09:58.681 --> 10:01.560
(laughter)

10:04.521 --> 10:06.481
Don't do it.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.858
I wasn't going to!

10:08.900 --> 10:11.319
Who cares if they don't

10:08.900 --> 10:11.319
believe me about the car?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.653
I've gotten this far in my life

10:12.695 --> 10:14.030
without anyone giving me

10:12.695 --> 10:14.030
any credit

10:14.072 --> 10:16.032
so why should I expect anything

10:14.072 --> 10:16.032
different now?

10:16.074 --> 10:17.700
Yeah, the guy who

10:16.074 --> 10:17.700
leaves thumbtacks

10:17.742 --> 10:19.660
on the toilet seat

10:17.742 --> 10:19.660
is so misunderstood.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.330
Please remember the

10:19.702 --> 10:22.330
ground rules: there's no...

10:22.372 --> 10:23.748
You're the one who taught

10:22.372 --> 10:23.748
me my name in French

10:22.372 --> 10:23.748
was "latrine."

10:23.790 --> 10:25.083
Don't interrupt.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.083
You're the one

10:25.125 --> 10:26.167
who sold my bike

10:25.125 --> 10:26.167
for three bucks

10:26.209 --> 10:27.668
to Billy Watson the day

10:26.209 --> 10:27.668
he moved to Canada!

10:27.710 --> 10:30.464
We don't...

10:27.710 --> 10:30.464
I'm the one who spit in Dewey's

10:27.710 --> 10:30.464
cereal this morning.

10:30.505 --> 10:31.672
I mean...

10:31.714 --> 10:33.300
I drank that milk!

10:33.341 --> 10:34.842
I licked the bowl!

10:34.884 --> 10:35.843
I hate you!

10:35.885 --> 10:36.761
Oh, shut up, pit stain.

10:36.803 --> 10:37.971
Leave him alone.

10:36.803 --> 10:37.971
You started it.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.680
Shut up! Shut up!

10:38.012 --> 10:39.680
You shut up!

10:39.722 --> 10:41.182
Stop it!

10:43.726 --> 10:45.686
This is not

10:43.726 --> 10:45.686
how therapy works.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.564
You are going to respect

10:45.728 --> 10:47.564
each other

10:47.606 --> 10:49.690
and damn it,

10:47.606 --> 10:49.690
you are going to respect me.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.775
You're going to behave

10:50.817 --> 10:53.694
and we are going to continue

10:50.817 --> 10:53.694
with this session!

10:53.736 --> 10:55.029
Understood?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.949
(grunting)

10:57.991 --> 10:59.700
Stop it!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.536
This is a safe zone!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.536
Get off me.

11:01.578 --> 11:02.745
(Dewey screaming)

11:02.787 --> 11:04.372
A safe zone!

11:04.414 --> 11:06.625
Stupid...

11:04.414 --> 11:06.625
(Reese screaming)

11:11.921 --> 11:14.715
Here is what you boys

11:11.921 --> 11:14.715
need to know.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.759
You cannot break me.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.719
I've worked in prisons.

11:18.761 --> 11:22.890
I had a 17-year-old

11:18.761 --> 11:22.890
serial killer hugging my knees

11:22.932 --> 11:25.018
and crying like a little girl.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.521
Those aren't Fisher-Price

11:25.059 --> 11:27.521
diplomas on the wall.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.729
I went to Harvard.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.774
I had a starring role

11:28.771 --> 11:31.774
in  The Mikado!

11:31.816 --> 11:33.151
(low):

11:31.816 --> 11:33.151
My arms are tired.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.654
Don't give him

11:33.193 --> 11:35.654
the satisfaction, Dewey.

11:35.694 --> 11:36.946
This is nothing.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.533
Mom makes us do this

11:36.988 --> 11:39.533
out in the rain.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.284
Okay, you can relax.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.458
(sighs)

11:48.500 --> 11:50.126
All right, let's try this.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.211
If you could pick one thing,

11:51.252 --> 11:52.920
about the way

11:51.252 --> 11:52.920
your parents treat you

11:52.962 --> 11:54.214
what would you change?

11:54.255 --> 11:57.008
The biggest problem

11:54.255 --> 11:57.008
is that they don't trust us.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.843
They just assume that if

11:57.050 --> 11:58.843
they leave us alone

11:58.885 --> 12:00.761
for two seconds,

11:58.885 --> 12:00.761
we'll get in trouble.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.306
Nine days past expiration.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.228
Ugh.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.606
Expired two months ago.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.108
You don't have the guts.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.491
(coughs)

12:21.533 --> 12:25.286
When was the

12:21.533 --> 12:25.286
last Christmas

12:21.533 --> 12:25.286
we had eggnog?

12:25.328 --> 12:27.455
I think before Dewey.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.334
(air hissing)

12:32.210 --> 12:33.836
It's all you, man.

12:34.837 --> 12:35.796
(coughs)

12:35.838 --> 12:37.465
Bottom of the ninth...

12:37.507 --> 12:39.800
two outs... man on first.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.094
The windup...

12:41.844 --> 12:43.054
...the pitch...

12:46.433 --> 12:47.850
Uh-oh.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.477
Oh, man, we're so dead.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.811
That's it, game over.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.812
Yeah.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.814
So I win.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.814
What?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.525
Past the lamp is a home run.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.651
Two men scored.

12:56.693 --> 12:57.611
That was a foul ball.

12:57.652 --> 12:58.612
Are you crazy?

12:58.653 --> 12:59.820
It went right down the line.

12:59.862 --> 13:00.821
It was foul.

12:59.862 --> 13:00.821
Shut up!

13:00.863 --> 13:02.823
You're home plate,

13:00.863 --> 13:02.823
you don't get a vote.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.659
Do over.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.659
Fine by me.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.249
Oh, crap!

13:11.291 --> 13:12.208
Now we really have to quit.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.419
Yeah.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.419
But that was a triple.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.170
Get back up there.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.716
Let me ask you...

13:19.758 --> 13:21.676
how do you see yourselves?

13:21.718 --> 13:25.555
Reese, what do you think

13:21.718 --> 13:25.555
your role in the family is?

13:25.597 --> 13:27.682
I guess I'm the bad boy.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.309
The one that ruins everything.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.018
Every family has that guy.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.437
The one that makes you cry,

13:32.479 --> 13:34.564
makes you hate coming home

13:32.479 --> 13:34.564
at the end of the day

13:34.606 --> 13:36.274
just knowing

13:34.606 --> 13:36.274
I'm going to be there.

13:36.316 --> 13:40.987
It's a lot of work, but...

13:36.316 --> 13:40.987
I guess it's pretty satisfying.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.872
What are you looking at,

13:49.912 --> 13:51.872
monkey boy?

13:51.914 --> 13:53.249
Ow!

13:53.291 --> 13:54.292
Ow! Ow!

13:54.334 --> 13:55.876
Reese!

13:54.334 --> 13:55.876
What are you doing?

13:55.918 --> 13:57.337
Help! Ow! Help!

13:57.378 --> 13:58.630
Mom!

13:58.672 --> 14:00.298
Help! Ow! Ow!

13:58.672 --> 14:00.298
Come on, cut it out,

13:58.672 --> 14:00.298
cut it out.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.175
Help! It hurts! Ow!

14:02.216 --> 14:04.051
Knock it off,

14:02.216 --> 14:04.051
you little...

14:02.216 --> 14:04.051
LOIS:

14:02.216 --> 14:04.051
Reese!

14:04.093 --> 14:05.720
What the heck

14:04.093 --> 14:05.720
are you doing?

14:05.762 --> 14:08.348
Honest to God,

14:05.762 --> 14:08.348
you can't leave that kid

14:05.762 --> 14:08.348
alone for five minutes

14:08.389 --> 14:10.141
without picking on him!

14:08.389 --> 14:10.141
I didn't do anything though.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.559
Go!

14:10.183 --> 14:11.559
He's lying.

14:11.601 --> 14:12.893
LOIS:

14:11.601 --> 14:12.893
Whatcha looking at?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.312
Reese's report card.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.105
It is much better

14:14.354 --> 14:16.105
than last time.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.940
Really?

14:16.147 --> 14:17.940
Yeah.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.819
This time he used

14:17.982 --> 14:20.819
the exact same brand

14:17.982 --> 14:20.819
of pen as the teacher

14:20.860 --> 14:21.902
to change his grade.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.154
Look at that.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.114
He gave himself a C in

14:23.196 --> 14:25.114
math instead of an A+.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.325
Yeah, subtle.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.325
Nice attention to detail.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.909
He's really learning.

14:28.951 --> 14:29.910
Two months grounded?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.954
Three months,

14:29.952 --> 14:31.954
scrubbing toilets.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.208
And how do you see

14:31.996 --> 14:35.208
your place in this family?

14:35.249 --> 14:36.917
Well, I'm the favorite.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.838
You know, the one

14:36.959 --> 14:39.838
everybody loves the most.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.921
The cute one.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.175
The one everybody looks out for

14:40.963 --> 14:44.175
and gives presents to.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.928
And sometimes they even

14:44.217 --> 14:47.928
make the birds sing to me

14:47.970 --> 14:50.598
or the clouds spell out my name.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.433
(grunts)

14:52.475 --> 14:53.852
Come on!

14:53.893 --> 14:56.771
You said I could play.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.319
You have to go

15:01.984 --> 15:03.319
down there again.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.487
No.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.573
Come on, you're the only one

15:04.529 --> 15:06.573
that'll fit.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.241
No, I always

15:06.614 --> 15:08.241
go get it

15:08.282 --> 15:09.950
and you never

15:08.282 --> 15:09.950
let me play.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.411
We'll let

15:09.992 --> 15:11.411
you play.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.995
We promise.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.248
(grunting)

15:15.289 --> 15:16.750
(grunts)

15:16.791 --> 15:19.252
Come on!

15:16.791 --> 15:19.252
Throw it here.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.587
You promised.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.962
No way.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.799
(sighs)

15:24.841 --> 15:26.175
What? Can't sleep?

15:26.217 --> 15:28.219
No, I have this

15:26.217 --> 15:28.219
terrible feeling

15:28.261 --> 15:29.888
we've forgotten something.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.099
Trash, locks, lights...

15:36.310 --> 15:37.437
Oh, well.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.481
Whatever it is, I'm sure

15:37.478 --> 15:40.481
it can wait till morning.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.446
Oh, boy.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.907
(snoring)

15:50.032 --> 15:51.158
All right, son.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.994
Son, I think you've

15:51.200 --> 15:53.994
learned your lesson.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.996
Okay.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.957
Thanks, Dad.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.879
We've got to stop

16:00.877 --> 16:02.879
doing this.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.424
Hup!

16:06.466 --> 16:08.008
(Dewey yelling)

16:08.050 --> 16:09.844
(grunts)

16:09.886 --> 16:11.053
(crash, popping)

16:11.095 --> 16:13.389
I try not to throw it

16:11.095 --> 16:13.389
in their faces,

16:13.431 --> 16:14.933
but sometimes, you know,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.017
I just can't help it.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.729
What about you, Malcolm?

16:19.771 --> 16:21.397
What's your place

16:19.771 --> 16:21.397
in the family?

16:21.439 --> 16:23.023
I don't know,

16:21.439 --> 16:23.023
I'm the middle one.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.400
Well, really think about it.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.027
How do you fit in

16:24.442 --> 16:27.027
with this family?

16:27.069 --> 16:32.032
Well... I...

16:32.074 --> 16:33.284
Go ahead.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.203
Well, I guess I...

16:36.245 --> 16:37.831
don't.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.290
I don't fit in.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.041
I mean, honestly,

16:41.083 --> 16:42.042
sometimes I feel like

16:42.084 --> 16:43.920
I've just been dropped

16:42.084 --> 16:43.920
into this family

16:43.962 --> 16:45.839
from outer space.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.423
Well, that's interesting.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.423
Now, how...

16:47.465 --> 16:49.342
Well, he's the one

16:47.465 --> 16:49.342
that fixes everything.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.093
What?

16:49.383 --> 16:51.093
Yeah, you know,

16:51.135 --> 16:52.637
he's the one that figures

16:51.135 --> 16:52.637
everything out

16:52.679 --> 16:54.221
and solves

16:52.679 --> 16:54.221
a lot of our problems.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.057
Yeah, kind of like that gay kid

16:54.263 --> 16:57.057
with the scarf on  Scooby-Doo.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.643
The leader.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.145
You guys think that?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.105
Well, sure they do.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.732
I mean, it's pretty obvious

17:04.774 --> 17:06.442
that you're the ring leader.

17:06.484 --> 17:07.443
What?

17:07.485 --> 17:08.862
It happens all the time.

17:08.903 --> 17:12.072
An intelligent, sensitive kid

17:08.903 --> 17:12.072
with poor impulse control.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.658
I mean,

17:12.114 --> 17:13.658
you're surrounded by people

17:13.700 --> 17:15.785
who don't challenge you

17:13.700 --> 17:15.785
mentally.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.664
So you start to get bored and

17:15.827 --> 17:19.664
you start looking for trouble.

17:19.706 --> 17:20.707
No, I don't.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.082
Isn't that what happened

17:20.748 --> 17:22.082
the other night?

17:22.124 --> 17:24.126
You're sitting on the

17:22.124 --> 17:24.126
couch with your brothers,

17:24.168 --> 17:25.753
nothing to do

17:24.168 --> 17:25.753
but watch TV,

17:25.795 --> 17:28.715
thinking the only way to

17:25.795 --> 17:28.715
end the crushing boredom

17:28.756 --> 17:31.091
is to stir up

17:28.756 --> 17:31.091
a little excitement?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.510
He didn't do it.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.510
None of us did.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.095
You know, there's a lot of

17:32.552 --> 17:35.095
options for a boy like you.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.765
I mean, there's

17:35.137 --> 17:37.765
placement programs, camps,

17:37.807 --> 17:38.975
special schools...

17:39.017 --> 17:40.518
Wait. You want to send me away?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.478
You can't do that.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.478
He's our brother.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.564
Calm down.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.564
I merely sug...

17:42.520 --> 17:44.564
I'm not going.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.899
REESE:

17:44.605 --> 17:45.899
You can't make him do this.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.067
We're good kids.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.785
(alarm buzzing)

17:57.827 --> 18:00.120
(alarm stops)

18:00.162 --> 18:01.789
(gasps loudly)

18:03.833 --> 18:05.084
Oh!

18:06.335 --> 18:08.671
Oh! (hawks)

18:14.176 --> 18:16.012
(screams)

18:16.804 --> 18:18.431
Hal?

18:18.472 --> 18:20.349
I'm late for work.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.524
Aah!

18:28.566 --> 18:29.776
Don't do this.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.652
You can't leave me

18:29.817 --> 18:31.652
alone with Reese.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.863
I'm sorry,

18:31.694 --> 18:33.863
but we're out of time.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.870
What is the deal with this door?

18:40.912 --> 18:42.997
Is there some kind

18:40.912 --> 18:42.997
of baffling built into it?

18:43.039 --> 18:45.833
You have three very

18:43.039 --> 18:45.833
special boys here.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.962
I'd like to sit down

18:45.875 --> 18:48.962
with you and your wife

18:45.875 --> 18:48.962
so that we can...

18:49.003 --> 18:50.088
Dad, do you know

18:50.129 --> 18:51.255
what this idiot

18:50.129 --> 18:51.255
wants to do?!

18:51.297 --> 18:53.424
Malcolm, let me talk

18:51.297 --> 18:53.424
to the doctor, huh?

18:53.466 --> 18:55.175
Maybe we ought

18:53.466 --> 18:55.175
to speak privately.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.844
Sure. Boys, (whistles),

18:55.217 --> 18:56.844
go wait in the car.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.555
(loud crashing)

18:59.597 --> 19:01.057
MAN:

18:59.597 --> 19:01.057
Where'd that come from?

19:01.099 --> 19:02.182
MAN 2:

19:01.099 --> 19:02.182
Hey, everyone all right?

19:02.224 --> 19:03.183
What?!

19:03.225 --> 19:05.645
That's my car!

19:05.686 --> 19:06.980
I know I set the brake.

19:07.021 --> 19:07.981
See?

19:08.022 --> 19:09.189
Just like the other night.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.274
We didn't take it out.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.692
It just rolled out by itself.

19:11.734 --> 19:15.279
Then you boys

19:11.734 --> 19:15.279
were actually telling us...

19:15.321 --> 19:16.781
the truth?

19:16.823 --> 19:19.241
You're a genius.

19:19.283 --> 19:23.079
Boys, let's go get you

19:19.283 --> 19:23.079
some ice cream, huh?

19:23.121 --> 19:24.622
Listen, there's

19:23.121 --> 19:24.622
a lot we have to...

19:24.664 --> 19:26.499
Oh, absolutely.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.002
You know, Doc, I have

19:26.540 --> 19:29.002
no idea how you did it.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.252
And in just an hour.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.464
I'm putting in a

19:30.294 --> 19:33.464
little extra for you.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.215
But...

19:35.257 --> 19:36.425
Thanks.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.722
Isn't it great to feel

19:37.760 --> 19:41.722
like a family again?

19:41.764 --> 19:43.099
Genius.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.224
Move!

19:43.141 --> 19:44.224
Shut up!

19:44.266 --> 19:45.225
Stop touching me.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.227
I'm not touching you.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.227
I was clipping on my tie.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.604
While  you were

19:47.269 --> 19:48.604
touching me.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.314
Stop it.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.314
Why do we

19:48.646 --> 19:50.314
have to do this?

19:50.356 --> 19:52.942
Because we don't have a single

19:50.356 --> 19:52.942
picture of us all together.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.110
That's ridiculous.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.236
We're a family, we should

19:54.152 --> 19:56.236
have a family portrait.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.321
Well, Francis

19:56.278 --> 19:57.321
isn't here.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.740
I'm not going to cough up

19:57.363 --> 19:59.740
200 bucks to fly him in

19:59.782 --> 20:00.950
for one silly picture.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.743
Where's Dewey?

20:02.785 --> 20:04.162
Dewey,

20:04.203 --> 20:05.245
get out of there.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.664
That's not your family.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.499
You sure you want

20:06.706 --> 20:08.499
"Autumn Leaves"

20:06.706 --> 20:08.499
as a backdrop?

20:08.541 --> 20:11.502
Yes.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.502
You didn't even

20:08.541 --> 20:11.502
looked at "Happy

20:08.541 --> 20:11.502
Windmills."

20:11.544 --> 20:14.047
It's more colorful.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.174
Ooh, "Space Shuttle."

20:14.088 --> 20:16.174
MAN: Next.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.843
I have a coupon here

20:16.215 --> 20:18.843
for one 8X10 and two

20:16.215 --> 20:18.843
wallet-size for $9.99

20:18.885 --> 20:20.053
and that's what I want.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.303
I don't want the Golden

20:20.094 --> 20:21.303
Moments Collection

20:21.345 --> 20:23.263
I don't want the

20:21.345 --> 20:23.263
Family and Friends

20:21.345 --> 20:23.263
Collection;

20:23.305 --> 20:25.558
I don't want

20:23.305 --> 20:25.558
the Lifetime of Love.

20:25.599 --> 20:29.436
I want one 8X10

20:25.599 --> 20:29.436
and two wallet-size

20:25.599 --> 20:29.436
for $9.99.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.646
Fine.

20:30.688 --> 20:33.066
We have an installment plan

20:30.688 --> 20:33.066
if that would help.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.358
I brought a picture

20:33.107 --> 20:34.358
of Francis.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.194
He's going to be

20:34.400 --> 20:36.194
in the portrait.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.277
Cool, I'll hold it.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.278
No, I'm going

20:37.319 --> 20:38.278
to hold it.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.321
Let go. I'm going to hold it.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.321
Come on.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.491
Dewey. Dewey, pants on, mister.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.701
I'm sorry,

20:43.743 --> 20:45.285
but this coupon's

20:43.743 --> 20:45.285
expired.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.285
What?

20:45.327 --> 20:46.120
It's expired.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.914
What you want will

20:46.162 --> 20:47.914
run you $39.50.

20:47.955 --> 20:48.956
Ooh... "Lonely Beach."

20:48.998 --> 20:50.958
We're kind of

20:48.998 --> 20:50.958
the lonely beach

20:48.998 --> 20:50.958
family, right?

20:51.000 --> 20:51.876
Hal.

20:51.918 --> 20:52.919
But for another

20:51.918 --> 20:52.919
five dollars,

20:52.960 --> 20:54.294
you can have the

20:52.960 --> 20:54.294
"Instant Memories" set.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.296
That comes with double-

20:54.336 --> 20:56.296
exposure silhouettes

20:56.338 --> 20:57.464
for the grandparents.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.300
Look, could you please just do

20:57.506 --> 21:00.300
what I'm asking you to...

21:00.342 --> 21:02.595
I'm older!

21:00.342 --> 21:02.595
It was my idea!

21:02.636 --> 21:04.513
(screaming)

21:06.057 --> 21:08.017
That is it!

21:08.059 --> 21:09.393
Get up!

21:09.435 --> 21:10.561
Get back!

21:10.603 --> 21:11.604
Come here!

21:11.645 --> 21:12.563
Go there!

21:12.605 --> 21:14.356
We are going to take

21:14.398 --> 21:15.942
this picture,

21:14.398 --> 21:15.942
and it is going

21:15.983 --> 21:16.984
to be good.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.695
And that means no faces,

21:17.026 --> 21:19.695
no tongues,

21:19.737 --> 21:20.696
no crossed eyes,

21:20.738 --> 21:22.031
no bunny ears.

21:22.073 --> 21:24.575
We are going to smile,

21:22.073 --> 21:24.575
we are going to look good,

21:24.617 --> 21:25.952
it is going

21:24.617 --> 21:25.952
to cost us $9.99

21:25.993 --> 21:27.327
and all of this

21:25.993 --> 21:27.327
is going to happen

21:27.369 --> 21:28.746
by the time

21:27.369 --> 21:28.746
I count to three.

21:28.788 --> 21:33.333
(boys arguing)

21:28.788 --> 21:33.333
One, two, three.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.836
(boys arguing)
