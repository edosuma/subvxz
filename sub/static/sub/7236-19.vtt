<i>Accessing archived data...</i>

00:08.515 --> 00:10.486
<i>Clu engineers a new toy.</i>

00:10.520 --> 00:12.927
<i>What does it do? The project?</i>

00:12.961 --> 00:15.601
<i>You'll see, soon enough.</i>

00:15.635 --> 00:17.607
<i>While the Renegade enlists an ally.</i>

00:17.641 --> 00:18.778
I need recruits.

00:18.812 --> 00:19.947
Will you spread the word?

00:19.981 --> 00:20.984
Count on it.

00:21.018 --> 00:22.722
Tron lives!

00:22.757 --> 00:23.925
<i>But loses a friend.</i>

00:23.961 --> 00:25.664
Run!

00:27.838 --> 00:30.780
<i>- He killed Able.
- What?</i>

00:30.814 --> 00:35.058
<i>- Mara, no!
- He killed Able!</i>

00:38.770 --> 00:43.081
<i>Able's dead.
Just doesn't seem real.</i>

00:44.120 --> 00:47.060
<i>Well, get used to it.</i>

00:47.094 --> 00:50.938
Because it is real. And
it's the Renegade's fault.

00:50.972 --> 00:52.710
Come on, we don't know that.

00:52.744 --> 00:56.755
He did it, Zed. He
kidnapped us and he blew up

00:56.790 --> 00:58.928
the crane with Able inside it.

00:58.963 --> 01:03.107
- Just like he blew up that shop.
- And part of the garage.

01:03.141 --> 01:06.083
<i>Yes.</i>- You see that?
Even Bit can put it together.

01:06.117 --> 01:08.824
So why can't you?
Or do you need the Renegade

01:08.858 --> 01:12.001
to walk in here and tell you himself?

01:12.035 --> 01:15.778
<i>I'm with Zed. It makes no sense.</i>

01:15.812 --> 01:17.684
And how would you know, Beck?

01:17.718 --> 01:20.893
You weren't there.
You're never there!

01:32.763 --> 01:38.144
- No one said it would be easy.
- But she blames the Renegade.

01:38.179 --> 01:41.052
- Then convince her she's wrong.
- You don't know Mara.

01:41.087 --> 01:42.858
I know you.

01:47.105 --> 01:50.949
- Hey, I wasn't finished...
- Beck.

01:52.019 --> 01:53.757
Tron!

01:57.505 --> 02:07.005
<b>S01E19 - Terminal</b>

02:08.532 --> 02:12.545
<i>Plasma density 64%.</i>

02:12.831 --> 02:15.739
Come on... hang on, Tron!

02:17.028 --> 02:18.899
<i>Full system collapse imminent.</i>

02:18.933 --> 02:20.670
Think, Beck, think...

02:21.875 --> 02:23.078
<i>Power increasing.</i>

02:24.918 --> 02:27.858
Don't give up, Tron!
You can do it! Fight!

<i>Warning. Power consumption

02:31.070 --> 02:33.809

02:43.137 --> 02:44.843
Tron!

02:49.022 --> 02:51.828
- Hey.
- It's no use.

02:51.864 --> 02:54.035
Don't say that. We'll
build a stronger tank.

02:54.070 --> 02:57.534
It won't make a difference, Beck.
I'm...

02:57.535 --> 03:00.855
I'm... dying.

03:00.891 --> 03:03.898
<i>The damage done to me by
Cyrus was far more extensive</i>

03:03.932 --> 03:07.843
<i>than I first thought. It's
compromised my healing ability.</i>

03:07.877 --> 03:10.852
<i>I can't fight this off anymore.</i>

03:10.886 --> 03:15.063
The virus is... eating me alive.

03:16.102 --> 03:18.741
Well, I won't let it.
I won't lose you and Able both.

03:20.146 --> 03:25.161
Beck, I can't be saved.
We need to prepare for the inevitable.

03:25.195 --> 03:27.099
How much time do you have left?

03:27.133 --> 03:31.178
Two cycles, maybe three at the most.

03:31.213 --> 03:36.159
You are Tron now.
The uprising depends on it.

04:11.966 --> 04:14.271
Huh...?!

04:14.306 --> 04:18.014
Sorry, you okay?

04:18.048 --> 04:20.576
Yeah. I thought I could do this.

04:20.577 --> 04:24.167
But, now I'm not
so sure I'm ready.

04:24.201 --> 04:27.008
What's the rush?
Able's locker can wait.

04:27.042 --> 04:29.215
When the time is right, you'll know it.

04:29.250 --> 04:31.789
In the meantime, it'll
be like Able's still here.

04:31.823 --> 04:36.001
- Like he's watching over us.
- Thanks, Zed.

04:42.288 --> 04:46.098
- Your disc or your life.
- You were saying?

04:53.186 --> 04:54.322
You think that's funny?

04:54.356 --> 04:58.000
Get up and I'll show you
what hilarious feels like.

04:58.034 --> 05:00.173
You haven't lost a step, have you?

05:00.207 --> 05:03.047
You're still the best
I ever fought beside.

05:03.082 --> 05:06.057
Do I know you?

05:06.092 --> 05:07.093
Cutler!

05:07.094 --> 05:09.968
- It's good to see you, old friend.
- It's good to see you.

05:10.003 --> 05:13.145
- What are you doing in Argon?
- I came here to warn you.

05:13.179 --> 05:16.253
Clu's on his way with
a powerful new weapon.

05:16.288 --> 05:18.092
But I know how to stop him.

05:18.127 --> 05:20.197
How?

05:24.010 --> 05:27.185
Not here.
You need to get word to Tron.

05:27.219 --> 05:30.160
Tell him I know how we can ambush Clu.

05:30.195 --> 05:33.973
<i>Tell him to meet me at the docks
at the start of the next cycle.</i>

05:44.270 --> 05:48.214
- Right on time, Cutler.
- Tron.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.286
Beck told you were back in Argon.

05:50.321 --> 05:54.366
I'm glad. The resistance needs
more programs like yourself.

05:54.401 --> 05:57.073
Now let's talk about this
ambush you've planned.

05:57.107 --> 06:01.252
Of course. It's simple, really.

06:09.343 --> 06:11.048
No.

06:13.288 --> 06:18.169
It all starts with your surrender.

06:19.473 --> 06:23.384
- Clu repurposed you.
- Clu showed me the light.

06:27.463 --> 06:30.171
<i>It's time to come home, Tron!</i>

06:31.375 --> 06:33.212
You don't have to die...

06:35.387 --> 06:38.095
At least we agree on something.

06:41.204 --> 06:44.077
<i>- Sir.
- Wait for it.</i>

06:56.309 --> 06:58.146
<i>Climb! Climb!</i>

07:02.326 --> 07:04.298
<i>Jumper Jumper overload.</i>

07:23.088 --> 07:25.158
Stay on him!

07:41.141 --> 07:44.014
Weapons systems online.
Target locked.

07:44.049 --> 07:45.218
We fire on your command.

07:45.253 --> 07:48.093
<i>Cutler: No. We take him alive.</i>

07:53.979 --> 07:56.217
I said I want him alive!

08:11.897 --> 08:14.905
Force him into the open.
Take down that ridge.

09:16.186 --> 09:18.225
<i>Enough!</i>

09:18.259 --> 09:20.398
You won't take me alive, Cutler.

09:20.433 --> 09:24.142
As I said before, I
expect you to surrender.

09:24.177 --> 09:29.391
- And why would I do that?
- Because you're dying.

09:29.425 --> 09:32.165
<i>We all know you're hiding
a face full of scars</i>

09:32.200 --> 09:34.071
<i>under that mask of yours.</i>

09:34.106 --> 09:37.147
<i>Which is why Clu sent me
here with this machine.</i>

09:37.182 --> 09:41.258
<i>To save you.
We can heal you, Tron.</i>

09:43.566 --> 09:46.374
<i>All you need to do is join me.</i>

09:46.409 --> 09:48.046
Don't count on it.

09:50.086 --> 09:52.326
<i>Come to the docks when
you change your mind.</i>

09:52.360 --> 09:55.301
<i>I'll be waiting!</i>

09:56.571 --> 09:58.510
But is Cutler telling the truth?

09:58.545 --> 10:01.353
<i>- Can he really save you?
- Computer Sterilizing...</i>

10:01.387 --> 10:06.367
<i>If that machine is what I fear it is,
mobile repurposing unit.</i>

10:06.401 --> 10:07.570
<i>Computer Unable to delete virus.</i>

10:07.604 --> 10:12.149
Wait... he's going to save you by
turning you into one of his drones?

10:12.183 --> 10:16.429
<i>All programs must be wiped clean
before repurposing can begin.</i>

10:16.463 --> 10:19.171
<i>When the machine
extracts my existing code,</i>

10:19.205 --> 10:22.213
<i>it will also extract the
virus that damaged it.</i>

10:22.248 --> 10:24.620
But what if I interrupted
the procedure right there?

10:24.654 --> 10:27.462
<i>- Would you be okay?
- System collapse...</i>

10:27.496 --> 10:30.603
- Possibly.
- Then we have to try.

10:30.638 --> 10:32.409
<i>If you don't get me out in time,</i>

10:32.444 --> 10:35.486
<i>I will become Clu's
greatest weapon against you.</i>

10:35.520 --> 10:39.229
But if I do... you'll be
back to full strength.

10:39.264 --> 10:44.311
You'll be Clu's worst nightmare.
What are we waiting for?

10:44.345 --> 10:47.387
<i>You're beginning to sound like me.</i>

10:47.422 --> 10:50.462
Stop. I'm done talking about it.

10:50.497 --> 10:53.606
The Renegade is responsible
for Able's death.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.246
You can't change my mind, Zed.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.386
But according to you,
Tron is the Renegade.

10:58.420 --> 11:02.330
Why would Tron kidnap us?
We're on his side...

11:02.365 --> 11:05.541
It makes no sense, okay?
But even if you're right,

11:05.575 --> 11:08.248
even if it wasn't the
Renegade who kidnapped us,

11:08.283 --> 11:11.559
Able is still gone, because
Tron, or the Renegade,

11:11.593 --> 11:15.603
or whatever he wants to call
himself didn't come to his rescue.

11:15.637 --> 11:18.477
That's what makes him responsible, Zed.

11:18.512 --> 11:22.691
And I won't just forgive and forget.

11:22.725 --> 11:27.571
Not this time. Able's memory
deserves better than that...

11:39.508 --> 11:44.554
<i>Recognizers. I hate Recognizers.</i>

11:48.034 --> 11:51.409
I'm all broken up inside over your loss.

11:51.443 --> 11:54.583
But time to move on.

11:54.619 --> 11:57.460
In light of recent unrests,
this repair facility is

11:57.494 --> 12:02.809
now under military control.
Welcome to my house of pain.

12:02.843 --> 12:05.483
I'll be in my office.

12:08.850 --> 12:15.554
<i>No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.</i>

12:15.748 --> 12:17.618
Shut up!

12:22.533 --> 12:24.774
Somebody clean this mess up.

12:25.810 --> 12:28.518
<i>This is wrong. We need help.</i>

12:28.552 --> 12:30.422
Oh, how about the Renegade?

12:30.457 --> 12:33.866
Oh wait, that good-for-nothing
hero is nowhere to be found.

12:33.901 --> 12:37.578
Guys, we can't expect the
Renegade to fight all our battles.

12:37.612 --> 12:39.651
He can't everywhere at once.

12:39.685 --> 12:41.857
Which is probably why
he couldn't save Able.

12:41.891 --> 12:47.473
You're right.
But maybe we could have.

13:09.673 --> 13:10.742
<i>Cutler!</i>

13:13.818 --> 13:16.725
<i>You've made
the right choice, Tron.</i>

13:16.760 --> 13:19.834
<i>And by the looks of it, just in time.</i>

13:20.906 --> 13:23.513
Perfection awaits you.

13:49.523 --> 13:51.627
<i>Initiating cleansing.</i>

14:03.630 --> 14:05.868
Sir?

14:25.628 --> 14:28.601
<i>Computer Preparing
for code extraction.</i>

14:32.515 --> 14:34.520
<i>Data removal commencing.</i>

14:40.906 --> 14:44.115
Hold your positions.

14:47.626 --> 14:51.704
<i>Cleansing complete.
Countdown to repurposing</i>

14:51.738 --> 14:53.543
<i>in five... four...</i>

14:54.613 --> 14:57.722
<i>three... two... one.</i>

14:57.756 --> 14:59.793
<i>Repurposing commencing.</i>

15:10.560 --> 15:11.729
Tron!

15:35.633 --> 15:37.038
<i>And you must be the Renegade.</i>

15:37.072 --> 15:39.946
I don't think we've met.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.752
<i>Wait!</i>

15:44.727 --> 15:45.929
He's mine.

15:51.882 --> 15:52.883
<i>Tron.</i>

15:56.729 --> 15:59.637
<i>It's me. I'm okay.</i>

16:04.051 --> 16:07.862
- Shouldn't you be taking it easy?
- This is me taking it easy.

16:10.770 --> 16:11.940
Come on. This way.

16:22.806 --> 16:24.811
Tron!

16:24.845 --> 16:27.652
Good news: I'm healed.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.993
Bad news: I'm healed.

16:36.947 --> 16:41.126
Where are you going?
We can repurpose you, too.

16:48.816 --> 16:53.161
You're fighting on the wrong side.
The revolution needs you!

16:53.195 --> 16:56.938
You're right. But it's
Clu's revolution, not yours.

16:56.973 --> 17:00.917
So long, Renegade.
It's been real.

17:00.951 --> 17:02.120
Cutler, wake up!

17:12.953 --> 17:14.891
Beck! What's...?

17:14.925 --> 17:17.031
What's happening to me?

17:18.971 --> 17:20.106
<i>No!</i>

17:20.141 --> 17:24.153
You're rejecting your repurposing.
Remember who you are!

17:25.992 --> 17:29.100
- Stay back! Both of you!
- Beck, don't!

17:29.134 --> 17:32.778
Clu demands your deletion!
Clu dem...

17:32.813 --> 17:36.220
- Fight it, Cutler!
- I... can't...

17:36.254 --> 17:38.026
Beck, we're running out of time.

17:38.060 --> 17:40.934
I'm... sorry, Beck...

17:47.322 --> 17:51.265
- Beck, we need to go, now.
- No, I can save him.

18:32.219 --> 18:34.359
Come on!

18:41.013 --> 18:42.950
<i>Beck!</i>

18:45.024 --> 18:46.026
Can you get free?

18:46.060 --> 18:49.269
I almost got it.
Just need more time.

18:49.304 --> 18:52.077
<i>They were in the main thruster.
They should be close.</i>

18:52.111 --> 18:53.247
We don't have more time.

18:53.281 --> 18:56.189
Give me the disc!
It's Tron they're after.

18:56.223 --> 18:58.062
I'll lead them away while you get free.

19:16.383 --> 19:18.020
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

19:23.403 --> 19:26.277
Hey, everyone! Check it out!

19:35.338 --> 19:39.082
You idiots, why aren't
you derezzing him?

19:42.158 --> 19:44.263
<i>Clear the way! Move it.</i>

19:44.298 --> 19:46.303
<i>Move program.</i>

19:48.544 --> 19:51.350
If you want Tron...

19:51.384 --> 19:54.326
you'll have to go through me.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.500
Will someone kill her already?

20:03.187 --> 20:04.489
And me.

20:08.202 --> 20:11.177
- Me too.
- And me.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.306
<i>From now on we protect each other.</i>

20:21.340 --> 20:25.418
Tell your boss we're done letting
one program fight our battles.

20:25.452 --> 20:27.592
Welcome to the house of pain.

20:29.432 --> 20:31.235
<i>You're all fired!</i>

20:41.267 --> 20:44.307
The uprising has begun.

20:44.341 --> 20:48.519
What is that ship doing in my city?

20:48.553 --> 20:51.428
I want answers and I want them now.

20:51.462 --> 20:56.375
Where did that monstrosity come from,
and why didn't I know about it?

20:56.410 --> 21:01.290
I don't know, General.
But if I had to guess...

21:10.452 --> 21:11.787
Clu.

21:27.468 --> 21:31.312
We're entering Argon now, sir.

21:31.346 --> 21:32.482
Good.
