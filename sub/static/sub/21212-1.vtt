01:09.880 --> 01:14.078
Our village sat high in
the mountains of southern Turkey.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.515
It was half-Turk,
half-Armenian.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.390
I was the local apothecary.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.510
For 200 years,
the Boghosians made medicines

01:23.600 --> 01:26.353
using formulas handed
down from our ancestors.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.673
We treated everyone alike,
Muslim and Christian, rich and poor.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.671
I was proud of our craft.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.993
But making potions from herbs
and minerals was not enough.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.238
My greatest desire
was to study medicine

01:42.360 --> 01:45.158
at the Imperial School
in Constantinople.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.074
But I could never
afford the fees.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.878
So, I decided to become
engaged to Maral

01:52.960 --> 01:55.599
and use the dowry
to pay my way.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.319
Here you are,
some tea.

01:58.760 --> 01:59.988
Thank you.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.075
Can I ask you
a question?

02:05.160 --> 02:07.355
Do you really want
to do this?

02:09.440 --> 02:12.079
We will build a future
together, Maral and I,

02:12.160 --> 02:14.151
and we will grow
to love each other.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.119
And you will
be proud of us.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.708
Give this letter
to your Uncle Mesrob.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.360
He is an important man
in Constantinople,

02:31.440 --> 02:34.318
but he has never
forgotten his roots.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.231
He will take
good care of you.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.311
I will make
you proud, Papa.

02:41.040 --> 02:44.919
The Boghosians will bring more
than medicine into Siroun.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.836
Always remember,
God has given you this mission.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.275
May He bless
and protect you.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.748
Whoa, hey.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.190
What a day, huh?

03:09.280 --> 03:15.116
The best wine, finest food,
and the perfect match.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.430
Thank you for your
generosity, Harut.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.911
Karine. That's it.
Thank you.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.468
Four hundred gold coins,
as agreed.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.275
My daughter's future
and my trust in you.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.272
Spend it wisely.
You won't regret it, sir.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.472
Normally, it takes
three years to become a doctor,

03:45.560 --> 03:47.676
but I know that I could
complete it in two.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.876
It will pass
quickly, Maral.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.752
Not quickly enough.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.480
I will pray for you
every day.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.989
Thank you.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.509
Whoa.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.153
I'm going
to the Grand Bazaar.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.639
Sir?
No, sorry.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.870
Please.
No, thank you.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.752
Ah, my friend.
Better prices here.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.068
No, no.
Better prices here.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.479
I'm going here.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.993
This Armenian dog
will rob you.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.116
Hey, hey, hey.
Get back to your thieves' den.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.231
Always trying
to steal my customers.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.355
Please.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.873
What can I
sell you today?

05:51.920 --> 05:55.708
Are you Mr. Mesrob Boghosian?
Mesrob Boghosian, yes.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.238
What, is it a bill?
No, no, no.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.993
This is from my father,
Vartan Boghosian.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.877
I'm Michael.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.518
You're Vartan's son?
Yes.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.238
Why didn't you say so?

06:07.720 --> 06:09.278
Speak up! Come here.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.998
Hello, uncle.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.999
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.278
Good morning.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.112
Thank you. Please.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.195
Ah, here's my sweet Yeva.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.954
Ah... Oh!

06:25.800 --> 06:27.438
Say hello
to Cousin Michael.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.953
Hello.
Hello, Yeva.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.075
Please. Please.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.515
Hmm.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.717
And here is
my beautiful wife, Lena.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.758
Michael Boghosian,
Cousin Vartan's son.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.469
Michael?
Yes.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.959
Welcome to our home.
Thank you.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.156
And my pearl, Tamar.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.754
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Hello.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.350
Oh! What a view.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.193
Here is Europe. There is Asia.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.396
The world is at
your feet, Michael.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.989
Do us proud.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.077
How old
is this suit, huh?

07:04.120 --> 07:08.113
Come by my shop sometime.
We need to dress you like a doctor, huh?

07:11.440 --> 07:14.273
Ah. That's the girls' tutor,
Ana Khesarian.

07:14.360 --> 07:18.478
The great violinist's daughter,
just back from Paris.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.470
Those are your notes?
Yes.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.751
So, you've already studied medicine?
Yes, it's my passion.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.431
Female anatomy.
That's my passion.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.800
I have no interest in medicine.
My father gave me two choices.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.154
This or the military.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.510
Emre Ogan. You?

08:16.640 --> 08:18.153
Michael Boghosian.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.832
Good morning,
gentlemen.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.593
Welcome to
the Imperial Medical School.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.151
Good morning.
Good morning.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.676
We haven't been introduced.
I'm Michael Boghosian, Mesrob's nephew.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.028
Ana Khesarian.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.429
Lovely to meet you.
Lovely to meet you, too.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.632
Would you like some coffee?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.516
Please.
Yes, thank you.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.828
You're an artist.
I try.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.959
May I take a look?
Please do.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.475
Huh.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.669
These are excellent.
Thank you.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.592
So, Mesrob tells me
you're from Siroun.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.640
Yes, I'm from Siroun.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.796
My family is from
the village of Ardoo.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.878
Ah! Ardoo. Yes, I've been there.
You have?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.791
Yes, yes,
I'm the local apothecary.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.096
And now you're going to become a doctor.
That's wonderful.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.078
Yes, yes, um,
I will do that.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.674
Go back to the region
and set up a clinic there.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.149
I intend to go back
there also, I think.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.639
Reconnect with my family.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.471
Dance time.
Yes!

09:51.560 --> 09:54.154
We dance each morning
before class.

09:54.280 --> 09:57.636
It releases the soul from here,
out to the extremities,

09:57.760 --> 10:00.479
the hands, the brain, the feet.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.313
It's both spiritual
and medicinal.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.311
Why don't you join us?
No, no, no, no.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.119
Come on, Cousin Michael.
Dance with me.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.200
It's wonderful.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.016
All right,
you want me to dance?

10:11.040 --> 10:13.508
Let's go very, very slowly
for Cousin Michael.

10:14.640 --> 10:18.758
So, throw your arms up
to the wind.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.354
Now, dance
through the forest.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.078
Through the forest.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.957
Through the fields
of flowers.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.196
Through the fields of flowers.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.188
Now, sweep them
into your arms.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.474
Arms.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.755
And cast them
to the heavens.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.398
Exactly.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.629
He's very good.

10:43.720 --> 10:44.936
All right.
He's a very good dancer.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.393
Goodbye.
Bye.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.513
It's medicinal.

10:50.080 --> 10:54.392
The deceased died
from cancer of the bowel.

10:55.280 --> 10:59.068
Monsieur Boghosian,
please remove the spleen.

11:14.920 --> 11:15.920
Very good.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.672
Now, Monsieur Ogan,

11:22.760 --> 11:26.150
can you please remove the
lesion on the small bowel?

11:27.920 --> 11:30.639
Lesion?
The cancerous growth.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.632
Hey. Come on.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.032
It was shit. Well, what do
you think is in a bowel?

12:23.760 --> 12:24.795
Come with me.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.552
Michael.
Ana.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.272
What a pleasant surprise.

12:28.360 --> 12:32.239
Chris, Michael is the nephew
of Monsieur Boghosian.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.633
Uh, Christopher Myers.
Hi, nice to meet you.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.109
The legendary Chris Myers.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.599
Emre Ogan.

12:39.680 --> 12:43.434
Notorious playboy,
frequents opium dens.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.193
How, and why the hell,
did they let you in here?

12:46.280 --> 12:47.520
Good to see you.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.313
May I introduce
Mademoiselle Ana Khesarian.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.433
Constantinople is blessed by your beauty,
Mademoiselle Khesarian.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.431
Nice to meet you.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.875
Please, join us. Sir.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.350
I'm so happy we get to meet
when I'm not teaching.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.793
Yes, what a surprise.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.633
Chris is a star reporter
for the Associated Press.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.393
We met in Paris when my
father was Deputy Consul.

13:11.480 --> 13:12.799
His father was a spy.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.336
That's why you were such
a good drinking companion.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.112
You were looking
to expose us.

13:18.200 --> 13:22.432
A toast, to old friends
and new. Cheers.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.158
Cheers.
Cheers.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.439
What brings
you here, Chris?

13:31.520 --> 13:34.478
Is it the war?
The AP star reporter comes east.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.788
The war is coming east.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.472
This place is so boring.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.710
It is boring.
I know the perfect place.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.233
Absinthe makes
the heart grow fonder.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.068
No, no, no, no.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.553
Dance with me. Please, come on.
I don't know... I don't...

14:41.640 --> 14:43.119
I don't know
how to dance this.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.679
I'll teach you.

14:55.520 --> 14:59.229
Oh, no. Poor Michael.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.435
He needs help.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.875
Let's swap.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.350
Oh. Hello.
Behave.

15:10.440 --> 15:11.509
How are you?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.238
I think I was
being attacked.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.436
I think you were, too.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.313
Bravo.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.236
Oh, what a night, huh?
Yes.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.390
Sunday is my birthday.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.040
My family are having a party
for me at Ciragan Palace.

15:41.120 --> 15:45.159
You must join me and save me from
my father and his guests. Please.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.837
Okay.
Yeah.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.951
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.031
Thank you.
And thank you.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.840
You make me feel like I'm home.
Thank you very much.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.349
Thank you. Good night.
Good morning.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.560
Michael!

16:36.640 --> 16:37.914
You made it.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.830
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.752
You look absolutely amazing.
Oh, thank you.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.478
Please join us.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.754
That's my father.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.308
He's a bigot. I'll spare you
the frosty introduction.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.400
Come with me.

16:51.440 --> 16:55.672
Dear all, this is my friend and
mentor, Michael Boghosian.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.113
Nice to meet you.
Ah. Here's Ana. Alone.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.960
Chris seems to have abandoned me.
I'm sorry.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.473
Foolish man.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.280
Some champagne?
Uh, water, please, for now.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.799
Hello, Ana.
Hello, Michael.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.398
Everyone, Ana Khesarian.
Hello.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.391
Hello.
Nice to meet you all.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.277
Ah. I hear
a French accent.

17:11.800 --> 17:15.554
I lived in Paris for many years,
but I'm a proud Armenian.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.190
This is a glorious day,
General.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.919
We have a flotilla
waiting to greet your ships.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.560
Would you like to escape the
Germans for a little while?

17:29.120 --> 17:31.714
Yes, I think I'd love that.
Let's take a walk.

17:32.040 --> 17:36.318
I do sketches for some Parisian
magazines and American newspapers.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.638
You're lucky to have
traveled the world.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.793
My mother died
when I was 10.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.476
So after that, my father took
me all over Europe with him.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.914
He played for...
for the Kaiser,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.230
for... for Queen Victoria.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.629
Wow. Huh.
It was wonderful.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.518
And then, um...

17:59.280 --> 18:02.829
And then he insisted I stayed
in Paris to attend La Sorbonne,

18:03.400 --> 18:05.277
and that's what I did.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.508
But, um...

18:09.400 --> 18:11.709
That was
a terrible mistake.

18:11.800 --> 18:12.994
Why?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.399
Because he killed himself.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.470
He was drowning in debt,

18:21.960 --> 18:23.632
and I had no idea.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.398
If it wasn't for Chris,
I would have lost my mind.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.078
I'm so sorry.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.229
Oh, my God,
what was that?

18:42.280 --> 18:43.280
Chris!

18:44.400 --> 18:46.960
Where were you?
We just took a walk.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.838
Ah. You look beautiful.
Thank you.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.751
You see that?
Did you see?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.314
German... German battleships.
Yes.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.712
A gift from the Turkish Navy.
Perfectly... Perfectly innocent gift

18:59.560 --> 19:05.078
from Teutonic friends
to the Turkish Navy.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.192
Turkey has every right
to have a strong navy.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.714
The Empire needs
to protect its borders.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.950
The Ottoman Empire wants
its borders to stretch

19:14.040 --> 19:16.110
from the Atlantic
to the Indian Ocean,

19:16.200 --> 19:17.679
and what these fellas...

19:17.800 --> 19:22.430
These Germans want your sultan to
declare a holy war against the infidel.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.988
The British, the French,

19:25.240 --> 19:27.151
and the Russian. Hmm?

19:40.320 --> 19:42.834
Curb your tone, Mr. Myers.
This is not Paris.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.536
It's certainly not Paris.
It's not Paris, okay.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.471
I apologize.
Yes, you do apologize.

19:46.600 --> 19:47.600
Maybe Berlin.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.154
It's starting to look
a lot like Berlin.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.037
Gentlemen, let us
celebrate this great day.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.352
Chris.
You've made your point.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.509
You've made your point.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.600
Armenians aren't singing?

20:00.720 --> 20:03.029
Oh, that's right.
You're the resident infidel.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.873
You'd be the first to go
when the war breaks out.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.793
Chris, man, please.
Ana!

20:16.800 --> 20:18.336
I let my anger
get the better of me.

20:18.360 --> 20:21.670
But the Germans,
I can't stand their arrogance.

20:21.760 --> 20:25.355
Their arrogance? You insulted me.
You insulted my friend.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.590
I'm sick of
your drunken behavior.

20:27.680 --> 20:30.797
I can't take it anymore.
I will stop drinking.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.432
I've heard that before.
No, I swear. I swear.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.278
Please sit down.

20:45.880 --> 20:46.880
I'm sorry.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.479
You wanted to come,

20:50.920 --> 20:53.593
find your roots,
and start over.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.433
I understand. I support that.
I love what you're doing.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.478
I love your illustrations.
They complement my work.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.676
I love that
we are partners.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.035
We have something
very special.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.033
Don't give up on that.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.508
Over there. Line up.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.669
Line up over there.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.354
Over there. This way.
Everyone must line up.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.989
Hey, Armenian, gonna teach you
how to fight and die now.

21:58.840 --> 22:02.435
Get in line.
No exceptions. Everyone line up.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.240
Next.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.109
Emre Ogan.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.879
Sadly, I must accept the
medical student exceptions.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.514
Next.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.592
Hello. Good day.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.954
Boghosian from Siroun?
Yes. Yes.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.278
You have been assigned

22:35.400 --> 22:37.000
to the third military division.
Uh, um...

22:38.120 --> 22:39.394
I am a medical student.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.480
So?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.349
Uh, I would like to apply for
a medical student exemption.

22:43.440 --> 22:46.398
You're not a Turk. Armenians
have to apply in their hometown.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.716
I can't go
all the way back.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.480
- I can't go all the way back.
- Officer.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.757
Mr. Boghosian is
a medical student.

22:56.840 --> 22:59.912
His loyal family are good friends
of my father, Ogan Pasha.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.318
Now, he would
appreciate a favor.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.200
Of course.

23:10.960 --> 23:11.960
Thank you.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.390
Thank you.
Thank you, my friend.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.040
You really thought I'd be
in line to join the army?

23:27.360 --> 23:28.360
Where are you going?

23:28.560 --> 23:31.233
There's something bad
going on around Konya.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.799
I need to investigate.

23:32.880 --> 23:35.917
And listen, it's very dangerous
for Armenians right now.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.719
When I get back,
I'll get you an American visa.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.631
I want to get you out of here.
No.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.149
What do you mean, no?

23:43.240 --> 23:46.437
No. I'm not going to pack up and run
off at the first sign of trouble.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.576
If it's not safe for me, then it's
not safe for any of my people.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.591
Ana, this is different.
This... I'm staying.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.349
Yes?

23:53.400 --> 23:54.515
Yes.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.390
Yes, I'll be there.
Yes, I'm coming right now.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.755
I have to go. We'll discuss
this when I get back.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.840
All right.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.672
Ana, you, uh...

24:08.360 --> 24:09.918
You be careful.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.519
You be careful.
Yes.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.548
Emre.

24:31.480 --> 24:32.549
Come.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.956
Father. Dr. Nazim,
salaam-alaikum.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.399
Alaikum-salaam.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.596
It has come to my attention
that you used my name

24:43.680 --> 24:45.875
to procure an exemption
for an Armenian.

24:48.600 --> 24:52.912
He's my friend, Father,
entitled to an exemption.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.039
The Armenians are a tumor
in our midst, Emre.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.037
Do you understand?

25:01.240 --> 25:02.355
Tumor, yes.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.433
You took this
military exemption?

25:06.240 --> 25:09.118
Yes, Father, I need to learn
how to identify tumors,

25:09.200 --> 25:11.031
so that I can best serve.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.475
Don't you agree, Doctor?

25:12.880 --> 25:13.915
Hmm.

25:15.320 --> 25:16.435
Good night.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.558
Ana! Ana!

25:25.640 --> 25:28.677
Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana!

25:28.760 --> 25:32.036
Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana!

25:32.120 --> 25:39.231
Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana!

25:53.960 --> 25:55.313
Thank you.

25:58.760 --> 26:02.070
May I? You got chocolate
on your face.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.673
Oh!

26:03.760 --> 26:04.795
Yes.

26:08.840 --> 26:09.909
Gone?
Yes.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.319
Thank you.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.268
Oh. Um...

26:13.400 --> 26:14.435
I was wondering,

26:15.360 --> 26:19.069
Father Komitas is singing
at the cathedral on Sunday.

26:19.160 --> 26:23.039
He's a dear friend, and my father
accompanied him many times.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.000
Would you like
to come with me?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Yes.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.516
Of course, I would love to.
Wonderful.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.749
Thank you.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.076
Good night.
Good night.

26:43.720 --> 26:46.154
Ana is a fine woman,
Michael.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.673
Yes.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.830
Chris is
a very lucky man.

26:52.920 --> 26:58.119
Hmm. Lena tells me things are not so
good between her and the American.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.918
You know, women talk.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.672
It can't happen, Uncle.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.797
Why not? She's very fond of you.
It's obvious.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.871
I'm betrothed
to a girl in Siroun.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.110
You are betrothed?
Yes.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.118
Her name is Maral.

27:14.800 --> 27:19.078
We're using the money from the
dowry for my studies here.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.752
Betrothal.

27:20.840 --> 27:24.674
My father, your great-uncle,
was a cruel man.

27:25.360 --> 27:29.558
He matched me with a witch.
She tormented me every day.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.677
Barren as the desert.
Thank God she died.

27:33.080 --> 27:36.868
Then I found Lena,
a good woman from our province.

27:37.560 --> 27:38.913
How much is this dowry?

27:39.040 --> 27:41.315
Four hundred gold coins.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.231
I've used 100 already.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.998
You give it back.

27:46.080 --> 27:51.154
All 400, and 200 more
to ease their trouble.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.835
Money is not a problem.
I will give you the money.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.638
I made a promise.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.395
I...

28:01.920 --> 28:04.275
I can't go back
on that, Uncle.

28:41.640 --> 28:42.675
Hello!

28:48.680 --> 28:50.318
We must leave, sir!

28:53.960 --> 28:54.995
Hey!

28:55.080 --> 28:58.629
We cannot be here.
We must leave. It's forbidden.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.594
Wait!
Come.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.358
We must leave. Come!

29:30.640 --> 29:32.119
Wait, wait, wait.
Go over there.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.428
Go over that way.
Nein.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.589
Go over that way.
Nein.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.272
Stop the car!
We can't stop!

29:36.360 --> 29:38.237
Stop! Stop the car!

29:38.360 --> 29:40.590
Stop the car! Get out. Get out!
No, this is my car.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.830
I'll pay you more.
Here. Here, here.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.831
Here. I'll come back.
Get out.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.753
That's my car!
This is my car!

30:57.440 --> 30:58.953
Get in! Get in!

33:25.240 --> 33:26.275
Kill him!

33:27.000 --> 33:28.069
Please, stop!

33:29.040 --> 33:30.075
Please, stop!

33:32.080 --> 33:34.071
No! Stop!

33:35.600 --> 33:37.272
Get away!

33:52.960 --> 33:53.960
Stop!

33:55.040 --> 33:56.075
Get in. Quick.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.229
Give me a key.

34:08.719 --> 34:10.915
Here. Room 12.
Take him up.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.878
Thank you.
I will send ointment, hot water.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.313
Thank you.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.232
They set fire
to his shop.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.792
Oh, my God.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.156
Let me take
a look at you.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.274
Oh.

34:59.640 --> 35:00.959
I'm sorry.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.719
Were you throwing cabbages?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.191
And a couple of potatoes.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.113
They can go make soup.

35:45.520 --> 35:46.669
Sorry.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.832
Where are you going?

37:29.040 --> 37:30.473
I need to go
back to the hotel.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.076
You can't go alone.
It's not safe.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.628
No. No. No,
I better go alone.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.551
I need to sort
things out with Chris.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.797
I'm coming with you.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.176
A young child tried
to pull her to her feet,

37:56.200 --> 37:58.031
and as she lay
on that dirt road,

37:58.120 --> 38:03.752
a Turkish cavalryman rode up and
dispatched her with a single shot.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.796
Write it. Write it.

38:05.880 --> 38:06.880
Good morning.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.590
Here you are, Miss Khesarian.
Thank you.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.871
All right,
hold for more.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.278
Oh, my God.
What?

38:16.360 --> 38:17.839
It's from Lena.
She's in trouble.

38:17.920 --> 38:18.920
Where were you?

38:23.600 --> 38:24.669
What are you
doing here?

38:24.720 --> 38:26.216
Were you with this bastard last night?
Wait, look.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.576
Please calm down, all right?
That's enough.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.636
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- Mr. Myers.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.976
Mesrob has been arrested,
and Lena is alone with the girls.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.319
We have to go right now.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.879
Mr. Myers,
New York is waiting.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.070
Ana.
We must go, Chris!

38:37.160 --> 38:39.037
- Ana!
- Mr. Myers, New York.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.394
We will lose
the connection.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.638
Armenian men are being
slaughtered in their villages.

38:46.760 --> 38:49.115
Their women and children are
being driven into the desert

38:49.200 --> 38:50.679
to be murdered!

38:50.760 --> 38:51.829
Send that!

38:55.720 --> 38:57.517
Lena!
Lena!

38:57.600 --> 39:01.149
Michael. Michael.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.115
What happened?
Oh, Michael.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.668
They've taken Mesrob.
Who has taken him?

39:08.760 --> 39:11.433
State Security have taken
him to Sikedji Prison.

39:11.520 --> 39:13.590
They said he's being
investigated for treason.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.075
All right.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.635
Wait here.

39:19.240 --> 39:21.913
- Is Papa coming back?
- Oh, Yeva.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.072
The men said
he's an Armenian traitor.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.993
It's a mistake, Yeva.
Your father is a good man.

39:36.120 --> 39:39.032
I'll go speak with Emre.
He'll help us get Mesrob out.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.714
I'll bring your papa
back home. Don't worry.

39:44.920 --> 39:45.920
Michael.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.394
Mesrob Boghosian?
Yes.

40:21.480 --> 40:25.519
This is good.
All right.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.834
Father Komitas.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.557
You come with me.
I need you to point out your uncle.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.873
You can wait here.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.996
Him. That's my uncle.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.429
What?

41:31.720 --> 41:33.073
What's happening? Please.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.754
Sir, I have an exemption.

41:35.840 --> 41:36.909
Emre.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.518
I warned you.
You will join the army today.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.511
The captain will escort
you to your barracks.

41:51.600 --> 41:52.999
I do not want
to lay eyes on you

41:53.080 --> 41:55.275
until you restore honor
to the family name.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.353
Sir. Sir. Please,
I have an exemption.

42:18.360 --> 42:22.114
...involving the mass arrest of
intellectuals, bankers, and clergy.

42:22.880 --> 42:26.350
It does appear to be
an attempt to stifle

42:26.480 --> 42:28.436
and silence
the Armenian population.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.832
Please, come in.
Yes.

42:33.920 --> 42:36.957
Ambassador Morgenthau, can I get
back to you when I have more news?

42:37.040 --> 42:39.793
Please, sit down.
Thank you.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.671
Chris, this is
Mesrob's wife Lena.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.273
They have nowhere to go.

42:49.240 --> 42:50.514
Come here with me.

42:50.600 --> 42:54.149
Nice to meet you. I'm so sorry.
Please, have a seat.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.878
Make yourselves comfortable.
Thank you.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.473
Let me get a cloth
for your face.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.272
Will you excuse me?

44:44.280 --> 44:45.280
Take his place.

45:11.080 --> 45:13.310
Help me. Help me.
Please!

45:13.400 --> 45:14.628
Don't let me die.

45:16.280 --> 45:17.554
Come. Come.

45:21.800 --> 45:22.915
All right.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.552
You should thank me.

45:34.080 --> 45:35.433
I eased your burden.

45:38.760 --> 45:39.829
Thank me.

45:42.240 --> 45:46.199
I said, thank me.

45:50.560 --> 45:51.560
Thank you.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.757
Thank you.

45:56.840 --> 45:59.513
Thank you. Thank you.

46:09.360 --> 46:11.157
He's better off dead.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.676
We'd all be better off dead.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.510
We won't have
long to wait.

46:18.600 --> 46:20.431
Another month,
winter will come,

46:20.520 --> 46:22.078
and we'll freeze
in these mountains.

46:23.320 --> 46:25.959
They need us for this railroad.
No, they don't.

46:27.120 --> 46:30.032
They're going to kill us. I know.
How do you know?

46:30.120 --> 46:31.314
Do you see that?

46:32.480 --> 46:34.596
It's a bullet.
It's still there.

46:34.680 --> 46:37.069
Went in my cheek,
bounced up here.

46:40.920 --> 46:43.388
I was in the battalion
building the Drizi Road.

46:44.680 --> 46:47.114
And when we finished,
they brought in machine guns.

46:47.240 --> 46:49.037
Blood everywhere.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.956
A few of us survived.

46:53.080 --> 46:55.913
Spared to dump
the bodies into a ravine.

47:00.480 --> 47:02.072
Let me see this.

47:07.560 --> 47:11.235
If we find something
sharp and some thread,

47:11.320 --> 47:13.390
I can take this out.
No, no.

47:14.240 --> 47:16.913
It's my good luck.
You a doctor?

47:17.000 --> 47:18.035
Medical student.

47:18.480 --> 47:19.629
Mmm.

48:02.480 --> 48:06.678
I was a clown
in the circus.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.597
I used to make
the children laugh.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.834
The dynamite is weeping.
Be careful.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.149
Thank you.

48:53.680 --> 48:54.715
Thank you.

48:57.640 --> 48:58.834
Shoot him!
Thank you.

51:36.680 --> 51:37.908
Water!

51:42.160 --> 51:43.354
Water!

52:01.720 --> 52:03.995
Some water! Water!

52:07.000 --> 52:08.319
Get us out of here!

52:09.200 --> 52:10.599
- Hello?
- Who is it?

52:10.680 --> 52:13.114
Help us get out of here!
Hello? Yes!

52:13.200 --> 52:16.397
Open the doors. Please.
Save us. Help us!

52:22.240 --> 52:24.231
Thank you! Thank you!

54:53.960 --> 54:55.552
You're Armenian!
I'm Armenian!

54:55.680 --> 54:58.638
Please, help me! Please!
Come. Come.

54:59.320 --> 55:02.278
These are our sons.
Did you see them?

55:02.400 --> 55:04.197
They were conscripted
in Tarsus.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.719
No, I'm sorry.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.631
Tarsus is close?
Yes.

55:08.720 --> 55:10.790
I am from Siroun.
Do you know it?

55:10.880 --> 55:11.880
I know of it.

55:15.560 --> 55:17.516
God bless you both.

56:21.120 --> 56:22.997
Food, please.

56:23.760 --> 56:26.638
Wake up!
Wake up, you traitors!

56:26.880 --> 56:28.472
Wake up, traitors!

56:31.200 --> 56:32.713
Great news.

56:34.040 --> 56:37.953
Our victorious army have driven
the British back into the sea,

56:38.520 --> 56:42.149
and the Russian dogs
have fled for their lives.

56:43.160 --> 56:47.119
Be ready, Armenians.
We will find you a new homeland.

56:58.600 --> 57:01.273
Who are you?
We have nothing here.

57:02.400 --> 57:03.674
Mama.

57:06.520 --> 57:08.909
Oh, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus.

57:13.280 --> 57:17.512
Papa. Jesus. Jesus.
Thank you.

57:18.760 --> 57:20.830
All the young men
are gone.

57:22.600 --> 57:24.397
Our business is gone.

57:27.640 --> 57:29.437
We have nothing left.

57:30.920 --> 57:34.799
Praise God,
at least we have you.

57:36.640 --> 57:38.039
I can't...

57:41.040 --> 57:42.792
I can't stay here.

57:43.360 --> 57:46.033
They'll kill us all
if they find me.

57:47.840 --> 57:51.469
Where will you go?
I don't know.

57:53.640 --> 57:55.915
I don't know.
Rest up, son.

57:59.520 --> 58:00.520
Michael.

58:14.440 --> 58:15.509
Oh!

58:18.760 --> 58:20.637
I'm not a ghost.

58:20.720 --> 58:23.632
Michael,
thank God, you're alive.

58:23.720 --> 58:27.076
Harut has the answer. As soon as
I told him, he had the answer.

58:27.800 --> 58:29.756
Get dressed
and he will explain.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.069
Come.

58:46.480 --> 58:48.710
Come. Sit down.

58:50.800 --> 58:51.994
Hello.

58:53.200 --> 58:54.553
Maral.
Michael.

58:55.520 --> 58:56.919
Here's my plan.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.150
I keep a cottage
for my woodcutters.

58:59.240 --> 59:02.073
It's high in the hills.
No one ever goes there.

59:02.160 --> 59:04.754
You'll be safe. We must hurry
to make all the arrangements.

59:04.840 --> 59:07.149
Maral will prepare all the
provisions you will need.

59:07.240 --> 59:09.708
Vartan and I
will bring the priest.

59:11.280 --> 59:14.590
The priest?
Yes. Oh.

59:14.680 --> 59:16.875
We'll have to have the wedding
at the cottage tomorrow.

59:16.960 --> 59:19.076
It is too dangerous for you
to go to the church.

59:19.200 --> 59:22.317
Tonight, you can
leave for the hills.

59:24.920 --> 59:27.798
My prayers
have been answered.

59:28.560 --> 59:32.758
You'll sit out this war.
Make babies.

59:35.360 --> 59:36.873
Praise God
you've been spared.

59:42.120 --> 59:43.599
What's wrong?

59:47.160 --> 59:50.197
In Constantinople,
I fell in love with someone.

59:52.880 --> 59:57.192
I can't do this.
I can't marry Maral.

59:57.320 --> 59:59.515
You have to marry Maral.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.350
Whatever happened,
that was another life.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.952
You told me you would
grow to love Maral,

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.071
and you will, my son.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.514
You will.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.432
Here you are.
That's it, come in.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.033
Everything you will need
for a quiet life.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.315
I will bring you supplies
each week.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.714
Welcome.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.633
Thank you.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.633
Tell me
about Constantinople.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.792
Is it as magical as they say?

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:42.153
There are churches and mosques
like you couldn't believe.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.315
The finest fashions
from Paris and London.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.918
And the Grand Bazaar,
you could buy anything you want.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.996
From a camel
to a crown.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.637
Were you happy there?

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.476
It was a different life.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.032
Can I help you?
Pastor Merril?

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.120
Yes. Who are you?

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.936
I'm Christopher Myers
from the Associated Press.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.632
I have correspondence
from the US Embassy,

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.517
and I have money
from the Church Relief Fund.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.910
God bless you. You're heaven sent.
God bless you.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.150
Hello, welcome.
Welcome.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.630
Dozens of orphans
are arriving every week.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.871
Most of them have just seen their
parents murdered before their eyes.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.753
This whole country
is a graveyard

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.718
of bloated bodies
polluting the rivers.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.035
Corpses rot
in the desert.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.873
I was told that you're organizing
an escape route for orphans.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.389
Who told you that?
I want to go with them.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:16.275
This is a historic endeavor,
needs to be recorded for posterity.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.912
A group of orphans left for the
port of Bassek a few days ago.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.875
When the guides return,
you can leave with the next group.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.719
Thank you.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.516
Lena won't come with us.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.915
Why?

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.589
She won't leave
without Mesrob.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.633
She wants to stay in Siroun
with Michael's family.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.149
I want to take her there.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.918
I need to go
and talk to his family.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.069
I really do.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.319
Would you come with me?

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.519
Of course.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.073
Thank you.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.109
My eyes get worse, Marta.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.792
Nonsense.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.316
You see well enough when you
count your money.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.032
We'll get you
better glasses.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.156
Who is it?

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.278
Who is it?
Lena. Lena Boghosian.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:00.068
Lena! Come in.
Come in. Oh.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.153
Vartan.
Lena.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.278
Close the door.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.599
This is
your Uncle Vartan.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.033
Who are you?

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.793
Oh, they are my friends.
They saved us, thank God.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.348
Mesrob has been deported
to Chankiri.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:18.910
They took our house, everything.
And then they came and...

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.996
We are good friends of your son
Michael from Constantinople.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.234
Michael is dead.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.635
Oh.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.513
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.432
There are spies everywhere.
You're a foreigner.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.158
You'll bring trouble
down on us.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.470
Marta, please. They have
cared for us, Marta.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.676
No, no, she... It's okay.
We should leave.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.076
He was a very good man.
I'm truly sorry.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.470
Lena is with
her family now.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.279
We will take care
of her and the girls.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:00.237
Ana.
Ana.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.913
God bless you, Ana.
Ana.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.273
Are you all right?

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.989
I think I am with child.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.317
Deputy Governor, welcome.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.114
The order from Istanbul is
that no one's to be spared.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.760
You should evacuate the
orphans as soon as you can.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.195
Who are you?

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.360
I'm Christopher Myers.
I'm from the Associated Press.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.556
Ah, yes, Mr. Myers.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.116
I've been alerted that you're in my district
and you're to be detained and deported.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.589
I have all the official documents
from the Sultan's office

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.432
and from the American Embassy.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.115
Mr. Myers, I suggest
you leave this place.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.235
I've done all I can, Pastor.
Please take my advice.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.360
Thank you,
Deputy Governor.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.715
I'm risking my life
being here, Mr. Myers.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.870
I want your word that
you will not expose me.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.475
You have my word. Absolutely.
I would never reveal a source.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.118
You need to get those
children out of here, Pastor.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.190
Who is it?
Mama, it's me.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.153
Michael.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.359
Why are you here?
What's wrong?

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.037
She's sick.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.475
Let's get these
wet clothes off.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.676
We must get her
to bed. Come.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.559
It's a very
difficult pregnancy.

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:32.716
She needs better nourishment.
She needs calcium, iron.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.154
Perhaps after she rests,
we can...

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.714
Michael?
Lena?

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:45.192
Oh, my God. Lena.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.354
Oh!

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.353
I... I thought...

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.116
Are the girls here?

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.350
Yes.
Yes? And Mesrob?

01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:59.037
They still have him.

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.238
How did you get here?

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:04.752
Ana and Chris brought us.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.837
- Ana was here?
- Yes.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.638
I told them
you were dead.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.117
Why?
You trust no one.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.800
Where is Ana now?

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.270
Michael, you have to leave
before the sun comes up.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.555
They were at the American
Mission at Moodan.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.433
The missionaries
have an escape route

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.118
to get orphans
out of the country.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.714
They're going
with them soon.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.270
Ana wanted us to go, but I won't
leave here without my Mesrob.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:37.674
Escape? How?

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.399
By boat from Bassek,
I think.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.395
Michael, seeing you
alive has given me hope

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.357
that my Mesrob
will also survive.

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:48.635
Yeva is restless.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.760
I have to go.
Michael.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.068
I have to find them.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.630
Michael,
leave these people alone.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.110
You're safe in the woods.
No, no, I'm not safe.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.351
No one here is safe.
Don't you see what's happening?

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.994
We have lived through these
Turkish threats before.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.913
It's not threats.
They want us dead.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.912
I have to get us out of here
before there's no time left.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.389
Trust me. It's all right.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.959
I'm getting us out of here.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.672
When will you be back?

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.949
Soon.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.356
Soon?
Very soon.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.997
My parents will take care
of you till I come back.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.835
Don't worry.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.472
All right. All right.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.789
Almost done.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.988
Close your eyes.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.398
One and two...

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.789
Ana.

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.679
Thank you.
I can't believe you're here.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.912
Lena tells me that you
are headed for the sea.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.594
That you have a way out
of the country. Yes.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.152
Ana, I need your help.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.313
My family in Siroun,

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.555
I need to get them out.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.548
Of course. Yes.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.595
I have a wife.

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.670
When we met
at Constantinople,

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:57.509
I was already betrothed
to a girl in my village.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.549
When I returned home,
we married.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.198
I'm sorry, Ana.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.791
Michael is alive.
I saw.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.873
He wants us to help his
wife and his family escape.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.637
We have to help them.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.193
And after that, he'll be gone,
and we'll never see him again.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.873
Here you go.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:10.638
Mr. Myers, when you arrive in Bassek,
find Reverend Antreassian.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.856
He'll arrange
the boats for you.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:14.576
And tell him we'll be along with the
rest of the orphans as soon as we can.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.034
Thank you.
You're a brave man.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:21.033
Thank you. God bless you.
And take care of them.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.269
Hyah!

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.632
We're close to Siroun.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.393
We'll find a place to rest
while I get my family.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.119
Here you go.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.236
Oh, my God,
you're so heavy.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:25.070
- May I have some bread?
- Oh, yes, me, too.

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.958
Thank you, Ana.
Thank you, Ana.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.754
I'm guessing that your wife
knows nothing about Ana?

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.595
What?

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.830
How do you intend
to introduce them?

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.151
Why? Are you going
to report it?

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.433
Is this what you do?

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.875
You feed off the pain
and misery of others?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.073
Without reporters, the Armenian
people would disappear,

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160
and no one would know.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.874
How wonderful it must be

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:06.032
to go back to the comfort of your
American home and write about it.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.359
- What was that?
- What's going on?

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.872
Mustafa, get the mules.
Ana, load them up, we should leave.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.951
- Everybody get up.
- Take my hand.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.713
Get into the carriage
right now. Quickly.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.472
Mira, help me.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.439
That's our horse. Oh, God.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.639
Papa.

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.678
Michael.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.999
Mama.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.957
Mama.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.837
Oh, thank God.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.073
Yeva!

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:16.269
Run! Michael, run!

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.835
Ana! Mustafa!
Oh, my God!

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.269
We have to go now!
Ana!

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.117
- I'm coming.
- Go! Go! We need to go!

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.957
Chris! Come back!

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.598
There he goes!
Turn around!

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.159
American!
American reporter!

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.075
I have papers. Here.
Get down.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.037
I'm gonna get off the horse.
Don't shoot.

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.518
Here. Travel documents
from the Sultan's office.

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.113
Permission.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.676
Mama. Mama.

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.589
It's over. It's over.
Mama.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:28.030
All right?
Mama.

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.714
Michael, tell me,
please, where's Lena?

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:34.312
They're all gone.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.552
They killed them all.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:11.075
Mr. Myers, I am Faruk Pasha,
commander of this region.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.515
What is the Associated Press
doing here, Mr. Myers?

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.349
Uh, reporting on the war.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.998
There is no war here.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.436
Merely the evacuation of the civilian
population to a safer region.

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.519
"The gallant
Armenian partisans of Van

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.956
"put up a heroic resistance
against Turkish divisions,

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.031
"inflicting heavy casualties."

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.393
Hardly objective reporting.

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.508
This is my favorite.

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.798
"A Turkish official,

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.111
"a man of unshakeable
humanity and courage,

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:53.715
"informed us
that Faruk Pasha,

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.712
"a general notorious
for barbarism,

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.616
"has been instructed
by the highest authorities

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.551
"to spare no village."

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.558
Are these words
your fabrications,

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.076
or the words of some
lying Turkish traitor?

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.793
Prove to me that you did
not fabricate these words.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.560
Give me the name of the
high-ranking Turkish official.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:21.553
I'll confirm he gave you this
information and release you.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.389
Uh...

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.079
No.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.151
You are not
a journalist.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.232
You are a foreign agent.

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.996
You insist there is war here?
Very well.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.636
Under the military code
of war,

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.911
I'm obliged to execute you!
No, no, no. No, no, no, no!

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.752
Don't! Don't! Don't!
To execute you

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.149
as a foreign agent and a collaborator!
Don't! Don't!

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.389
Now,

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:01.669
was that my barbarism
or mercy?

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.514
Take him!

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.389
Who are you?

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.592
We're fleeing Siroun
on the way to Bassek.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.468
This is Bassek.
No one left in the village.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.358
We were told to find
a Reverend Antreassian,

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.376
and he would arrange
for a boat for these orphans.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.870
There are no boats. The Turks
have destroyed them all.

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.157
Who are you?
I'm the mayor of Bassek.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.391
The Turks are on their way
to drive us into the desert.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.313
You'll find Reverend
Antreassian back there.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:09.272
Excuse me. Reverend Antreassian?
Back there.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.039
Reverend Antreassian?
Hello.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:13.576
We are from the American Mission.
Hello.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.239
We were told to meet you in Bassek.
Where are you going?

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.833
I don't know.

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.879
Faruk Pasha sent orders that we
were to be evacuated to Aleppo.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.390
Mayor Stepan announced that
we would not obey the Turks.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.955
We have brought
the orphans with us.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.111
You need to come with us.
We will care for you.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:40.432
There's this American reporter,
Chris Myers. Did he find you?

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.552
No. No, I have not
encountered any Americans.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.755
Oh.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.478
Thank you very much
for your help.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.439
Emre. Am I glad
to see you.

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.957
You're in very serious trouble, Chris.
Hmm.

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.110
They're going
to make you disappear.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.119
I need your help, Emre.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.511
I need to get word
to the American Ambassador.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.828
He can stop this.

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.389
Help?

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:42.309
I'm in this ridiculous uniform
because I tried to help Michael.

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:46.676
Now, you're asking me to
commit an act of treason? I...

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:51.390
Listen, Chris, they're
willing to offer you a deal.

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.039
You sign it,

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:04.631
you'll live, Chris.

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:09.392
You'll go to jail, but your
government will get you out.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.950
The world knows
you're not a spy.

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.596
If I sign this confession,

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.790
destroys everything
I've ever written.

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.598
My reputation, my future.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.514
Future? What future?

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:35.392
Trust me, my friend, if you do not
sign this, your future ends tonight!

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:42.355
No one knows you are here.
No one will know you died.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.509
You'll know.

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:51.789
Hey.

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.313
Listen to me.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.635
The Turks will come
soon to punish us.

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:23.198
Join me and fight them,
or you should leave now.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:25.119
Fight them? With what?

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.350
With whatever weapons
we have.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:30.113
With stones and rocks
and our bare hands.

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:35.391
I will not walk out into the desert
to starve or to die of thirst.

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.948
We have brought enough food
to reach Aleppo.

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:40.200
You'll never make it.
You'll be murdered along the way.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:45.113
Who are you
to spread such rumors?

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.029
Right now,
outside of Siroun,

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:59.075
you'll find the bodies of every
Armenian from my village,

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:00.832
rotting in a river.

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:06.030
Every man, woman, and child,
marched from their home,

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:11.077
brought there, and slaughtered,
all of them.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.835
My father, my wife,

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.308
stabbed, slashed open,

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.113
our unborn child
ripped from her womb.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:27.357
You don't believe me?

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.355
Hmm?

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:35.553
Go. Go look for yourself.

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:38.791
Follow the vultures
and the smell.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:42.192
You have heard this man.
He speaks the truth.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.113
We will not walk
like sheep to slaughter.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.475
We will make refuge
on Musa Dagh.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.034
And if the Turks will
not leave us in peace,

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.594
we'll fight them
from every rock.

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:57.069
Let's move!

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.515
Michael.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.951
I'm so sorry.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.311
We need to prepare.

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:34.475
Ambassador Morgenthau,
my apologies for the delay.

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.515
What is the problem?

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.909
I have reason to believe,
Talaat Pasha,

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.436
that your military is about to
execute an American citizen.

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.839
We have captured a spy.

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:48.356
He is indeed an American.
Christopher Myers.

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.670
Both our countries
have the same punishment

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.671
for spying
during wartime, no?

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:55.194
The United States
is not at war with Turkey.

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.192
Myers attacked our men, and he has
been collaborating with traitors.

01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.315
Nonsense.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.231
He's a world-renowned
journalist.

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.439
He's a spy,

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:05.999
and he has used journalism

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:09.231
to smear the Ottoman Empire and
its soldiers around the world

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.880
with his fabrication about the
relocation of the Armenians.

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:17.353
Minister, you are using this
so-called "relocation" as a cover

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.677
for the systematic extermination
of the Armenian people.

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:24.710
Christopher Myers has been reporting
this outrage to the world.

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.791
That is why you want
to silence him.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.634
Ambassador, you're Jewish.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.154
Why are you so concerned about
these Armenian Christians?

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:37.553
I am a Jew
and I am an American.

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.632
Many Americans
have fled persecution,

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.598
and they are appalled
by what is taking place here.

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.917
Now, I am making
a formal request

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.150
that you release
Christopher Myers.

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.231
And I must caution you,

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.753
any harm done to him

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.637
will be considered
an act of aggression

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:55.995
against the United States
of America.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.308
Good day to you, sir.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.919
One thing, Ambassador.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.592
The New York Life
Insurance Company

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.240
and the Equitable Life
of New York have,

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.920
for years, done considerable
business among the Armenians.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.360
I wish you would get these
American life insurance companies

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:12.352
to send us a complete list
of Armenian policyholders.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.856
They're practically
all dead now,

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.838
and they have left no heirs
to collect the money.

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:20.151
It all, of course,
reverts to the state.

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.800
The government is
the beneficiary now.

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:26.595
You will never get
any such list from me.

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:57.911
All right, this is where
we will build our tent.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:02.469
This is going to be
the best tent of the camp.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:07.956
- Who will help me?
- I will! I will!

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:09.359
Let's get started.

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:15.638
We have only a few weapons.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:18.632
Don't take one unless you
know how to use it well.

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:24.516
Can you shoot?
Yes.

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.952
- Can you shoot?
- Yes.

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.998
Can you shoot?
Yes.

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.710
Are you the one he fell in
love with in Constantinople?

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.550
He told me he loved you,

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.915
but I made him marry Maral.

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.078
You're getting
good at this.

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.469
Do you remember
the French song we learned?

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.551
- Yes!
- Yes? Let's sing it.

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:36.074
- Who wants to lead?
- Me, me, me!

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.354
Hmm.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.475
Mira.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.355
Come on, let's go. Move!

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:09.993
I want to talk
to this man.

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.536
I thought I was being driven
to an unmarked grave.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.629
What's going on?

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:15.551
You're being deported
to Malta.

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.877
How did you know I'd been captured?
Someone called the Embassy.

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:22.995
Thank you.

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:25.795
I have a request.

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.559
Can you contact a Reverend
Antreassian in Bassek

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.438
and find out if Ana Khesarian
and a group of orphans

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:34.714
reached there safely?

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:37.035
I'll do my best.
Good luck to you.

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:38.473
Thank you, sir.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:53.595
Sir.

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:57.995
Lieutenant.

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.199
One moment.

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:06.791
Read that, Lieutenant Ogan,
your normal voice.

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.390
"I have important information.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:23.516
"The reporter Chris Myers is
being held at Army Headquarters.

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:27.275
"He will...
He will be executed."

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.235
They're here.
Get the men together.

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.829
Surrender these weapons.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:41.434
Come down,
or we will kill you all.

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:45.115
All we ask
is to live in peace here.

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.913
Hold fire. Hold fire!

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:07.916
Hold fire!

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.757
Hold the line! Hold the line!

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:26.352
Shoot him! Shoot him!

01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.472
Fall back! Fall back!

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:27.478
Press here. Hard.
As hard as you can.

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:35.078
I found these tools
for you.

01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.754
Give those to Susie, please.
And I need more alcohol.

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:46.873
Take these and boil them.
Fifteen minutes. All right.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:01.715
The Turks will be back soon.

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.917
Tomorrow, at dawn,
we will climb higher.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.470
Everything that cannot be
carried should be destroyed.

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.312
Livestock, carts.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.709
If you cannot
carry it, burn it.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:41.238
Here. I made you
some tea.

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.199
Thank you.

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.679
I couldn't do it.

01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.596
I couldn't pull the trigger.

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:39.709
Pasha, the Armenians
ambushed us.

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:41.472
There were hundreds
of Armenian gunmen,

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.790
well armed,
with snipers positioned.

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:47.068
They appeared to be retreating,
so then... Enough!

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:51.155
Mobilize the third division
and the artillery.

01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:59.038
Admiral.
Admiral Fournet?

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.832
I'm Christopher Myers
from the Associated Press.

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.360
I'm told that you plan
to investigate

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:07.198
the plight of the Armenians
on the Turkish coast.

01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.872
That is
restricted information.

01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:10.837
Would you permit me
to sail with you?

01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.359
Why would I do that?

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:16.496
Well, if you want the United
States to join this war,

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.816
then the American public need
to know what the enemy is doing

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:20.796
and what you're doing
to fight them.

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.832
Everyone,
find a place to camp.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.878
Thank you.

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.189
Marta, I have
some soup for you.

01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:32.389
Marta?

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:40.559
Oh...

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:49.829
Dear Lord, take
your loving child Marta,

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:52.952
who endured all
with such bravery.

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:59.956
Take her into your care with as
much love as she gave to us.

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:03.989
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.471
We were always arguing.

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.311
We'd fight all the time.

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:27.510
She would fight more with me
than with my father.

01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.998
I think it's because we are
the most alike.

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.079
My mama.

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:52.197
They're all gone now.

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.312
Yeva and I are all
that's left of my family.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:06.828
I know

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.354
that it won't bring
any of them back,

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.509
but God help me,
I want revenge.

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:20.393
I don't care.

01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:23.517
Hey. Hey.

01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.354
Our revenge
will be to survive.

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:01.632
Fast! Run! Run! Run!

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.915
Run! Run! Run!
Fast as you can!

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.798
Everyone stay down!
Keep your head down!

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:09.153
Come!

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:11.470
Mira! Get on the rocks!

01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:15.230
Get down! Stay down!

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:21.198
It's all right. You're all right.
Come, here!

01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:41.192
Reverend, they say
the Turks will kill us all.

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.956
It's not true.
God will protect us, yes?

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.389
Let's pray together.

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:58.831
Dear Lord, the light of
all goodness and mercy,

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:03.032
please protect us
in our hour of need

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:06.317
and help us survive
these cruel times,

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:10.396
so we may once more
sing your praises.

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:27.352
A French battleship is
steaming toward the coast.

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.078
Tomorrow I want
a final assault.

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.352
Look, there!

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:44.035
Light the bonfires!
Get everyone down to the beach.

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.192
Easy. On my command.

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:00.759
Go, go, go!

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:03.513
To the beach!
Everyone, hurry!

01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:43.796
Admiral, I need
to be there.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.914
Hurry! Hurry, everyone!

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.479
Bring the children!

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:17.560
Have you seen children?
Have you seen children?

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.750
A group of orphans?
Ana...

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:33.920
Ana!

01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:35.869
Chris?

01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:38.030
Ana!
Oh, Chris!

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:41.548
Oh, thank God!
Oh, my God!

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.558
Where's Michael?
He's coming behind us.

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:53.073
Quickly, everyone,
come on!

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:10.632
Stay together. I'm going back to help.
Keep close to me.

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.157
Chris.
Michael.

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.832
You survived.

01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:26.354
Thank God.
How can I help?

01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:27.754
The people there,

01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:30.669
help them down.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.672
Thank you, Chris.

01:55:58.520 --> 01:55:59.873
She's injured.

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:06.759
Michael!

01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.951
Ana!
Michael!

01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:24.198
Did you see Chris?
Yes. Yes. He's on his way down.

01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.356
I love you. I love you.

01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:55.718
Let me help you.

01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:03.278
Get your leg up.

01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:25.868
This will help.

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:27.913
Here, put this on.

01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.198
All right,
put this on.

01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:33.078
Put your hands up.

01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:47.311
Help! Help!

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:54.515
Help us!
Hold on. Hold on.

01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.794
Michael!

01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.276
Ana! Ana!

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.399
Ana!

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:18.679
Ana!

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:23.480
Ana!

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.352
Ana!

01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:16.795
Yeva!

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:24.840
Help!

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:42.718
Where's Ana?
Where's Ana?

02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:19.629
Michael!

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.235
Michael!

02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:30.789
Where is she?

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:34.788
Michael.

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.028
Michael.

02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:37.440
There was nothing
that could be said.

02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:41.079
Both of us had lost
the woman we loved.

02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:48.551
The French took us
to a refugee camp in Egypt.

02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:54.631
Chris arranged for US visas
for me, Yeva, and the orphans.

02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:00.190
We lost Chris in 1938.

02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:04.472
He died while reporting
on the Spanish Civil War.

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.831
I adopted Yeva,

02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:14.914
finished my medical studies, and set up
a practice in Watertown, Massachusetts.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.719
After the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor,

02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:19.597
Yeva joined
the Women's Army Corp

02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.437
and fell in love with a
young Marine lieutenant.

02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:27.156
And on her wedding day,

02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:30.277
the orphans joined us
in celebration.

02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.077
A toast in Armenian.

02:02:58.040 --> 02:02:59.871
May they return safely to us.

02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:02.597
Cheers.

02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:09.192
My darling Yeva told me
that her greatest wish

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.592
was that her parents
and our dear Ana were here.

02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:18.790
I told her I know
that they are.

02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:20.711
For sure, they are here.

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:26.554
And all of your parents
and all those families lost

02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:31.031
in an attempt to wipe our nation
from the face of the Earth.

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:33.757
But we're still here.

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:38.869
We're still here.
