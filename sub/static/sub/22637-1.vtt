00:32.993 --> 00:35.362
Hey, you've reached Alex.
Leave a message after the beep.

00:35.364 --> 00:38.986
Hey, Alex, this is Ralph White.

00:38.988 --> 00:41.485
We met on SimplySingle.com.

00:43.876 --> 00:47.053
Hey, Carrie. This is Ralph
from our writing class.

00:47.055 --> 00:50.371
Listen, I still feel really
bad about being so harsh

00:50.373 --> 00:52.803
about your last piece about the dying cat.

00:55.970 --> 00:57.416
I'm not really a cat person,

00:57.418 --> 00:59.510
and I didn't know it
was a personal narrative.

01:01.527 --> 01:03.399
Hey, it's Diane. You know what to do.

01:03.401 --> 01:05.301
Diane! Hey.

01:05.303 --> 01:08.238
Ralph White. Um, I don't
know if you remember me,

01:08.240 --> 01:10.319
but we went on a date last May.

01:10.321 --> 01:13.670
Steph! Ralph!

01:13.672 --> 01:18.126
Hey, um, I know things
didn't go so good last time.

01:27.571 --> 01:32.408
You got a little upset because I wore
white socks with black slacks to the ballet.

01:32.410 --> 01:35.176
But I swear I have a full tank of gas now,

01:35.178 --> 01:37.448
so there's zero chance
of that happening again.

01:40.318 --> 01:42.418
You've reached Yvonne. Leave a message.

01:42.420 --> 01:43.985
Hey, Yvonne.

01:43.987 --> 01:46.154
Um, this is Ralph.

01:46.156 --> 01:48.690
Hey, we miss you down
at the retirement home.

01:50.628 --> 01:53.329
Anyway, super short notice,

01:53.331 --> 01:55.464
but I've got a wedding coming up here.

01:55.466 --> 01:57.098
Listen, lesson learned.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.500
Um, let me make it up to you.

01:58.502 --> 02:00.602
I've got this thing tomorrow afternoon

02:00.604 --> 02:04.940
that I was hoping you might be
willing to be my date for. Um...

02:04.942 --> 02:07.709
Leave a message after the beep.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.946
Uh, you can wear a dress. Uh, I won't.

02:10.948 --> 02:13.615
It's Ralph. Listen, um...

02:13.617 --> 02:15.185
Sorry, uh...

02:18.055 --> 02:19.455
So give me a call back.

02:19.457 --> 02:21.189
I mean, I know you say that your phone

02:21.191 --> 02:23.191
is always having problems,

02:23.193 --> 02:26.299
and I guess I believe you.

02:26.301 --> 02:28.096
Leave a message.

02:28.098 --> 02:31.066
Uh, anyway, um, hope to hear from you.

02:59.096 --> 03:02.631
- So this is it.
- What do you mean?

03:02.633 --> 03:04.633
What did you say your name was again?

03:04.635 --> 03:07.503
Uh, Rexlor
two-one-three-five.

03:07.505 --> 03:10.372
Two-one-three-five...

03:10.374 --> 03:13.609
You're not even in the lower
thousand and you come to me with this

03:13.611 --> 03:16.347
expecting to be issued a permit?

03:18.449 --> 03:21.116
Well, I hoped you'd see the
potential there and realize...

03:21.118 --> 03:22.651
You think that we'll allow you a partner

03:22.653 --> 03:25.086
and a permit based off of potential?

03:25.088 --> 03:27.723
By the moons of Enzon, we
need candidates who show...

03:27.725 --> 03:30.125
- What the shit is this?
- Franco.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.494
I'm sorry, but seriously,
what the hell is going on here?

03:32.496 --> 03:34.730
Are they seriously sitting in a white room?

03:34.732 --> 03:38.267
And the dialogue? "By the moons of Enzon."

03:38.269 --> 03:41.403
Stiff and contrived much?

03:41.405 --> 03:43.472
Ralph, have you read much science fiction?

03:43.474 --> 03:47.411
Uh, no, but I've watched quite a bit of it.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.413
All right.

03:51.415 --> 03:54.783
Clichés and lack of description
aside, Franco does have a point.

03:54.785 --> 03:56.685
I have no idea what's going on here.

03:56.687 --> 04:00.556
So it's supposed to be
like a dystopian future

04:00.558 --> 04:03.392
where the world is overpopulated
and women are in charge,

04:03.394 --> 04:07.663
and so in order to procreate men have
to go through an application process

04:07.665 --> 04:11.667
to prove they have what it
takes in order to be a good mate.

04:11.669 --> 04:14.836
- Get laid much?
- Does the woman have a name?

04:14.838 --> 04:18.707
- I don't see one anywhere here.
- Sounds like someone's writing about their ex-girlfriend to me.

04:18.709 --> 04:21.410
- Get dumped much?
- God, quit saying that.

04:21.411 --> 04:26.482
Ralph... I see what you're
trying to do with this.

04:26.484 --> 04:31.188
I think you need a lot more life experience before
you'll be able to pull something like this off.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.757
How was it today?

04:35.759 --> 04:39.029
- Any luck finding a date?
- No.

04:40.731 --> 04:44.633
- Did you ask Lorane?
- I'm not gonna ask Lorane.

04:44.635 --> 04:46.568
It's too bad I have so many
boys fighting to be my date,

04:46.570 --> 04:48.470
otherwise I would have stood in for you.

04:48.472 --> 04:51.707
What are you talking about?
You don't have a date.

04:51.709 --> 04:55.377
Quit being weird. I'm gonna get changed.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.047
Mm-hm.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.851
- Hey, you almost ready?
- Yeah, just feeding him.

05:02.853 --> 05:05.487
Great. Let's roll. We
don't want to be late.

05:12.663 --> 05:16.798
- You've been there, what, like, three years now?
- It's five.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.268
- You might want to...
- It's not awful.

05:19.270 --> 05:22.304
I mean, have you ever thought
about going back to school

05:22.306 --> 05:26.810
or getting into something
that's more of an actual career?

05:34.685 --> 05:36.885
- Ralph White.
- Shit.

05:36.887 --> 05:39.888
- Man, look at you.
- Hey, Lorane.

05:39.890 --> 05:42.824
God, what has it been, like,
five years? How are you?

05:42.826 --> 05:45.794
I've been good, just, uh,
you know, living the dream.

05:45.796 --> 05:48.530
God, I hope not. Who are you here with?

05:48.532 --> 05:50.432
- I'm here with Maggie.
- Really?

05:50.434 --> 05:52.200
Wow. She's still around, huh?

05:52.202 --> 05:54.738
Well, why wouldn't she be?

05:56.173 --> 05:57.839
So... where are you now?

05:57.841 --> 06:01.543
Last I heard you were still
at the, um, nursing home?

06:01.545 --> 06:04.880
- Uh, retirement community. Yeah.
- Right. Right.

06:04.882 --> 06:06.815
So did you ever finish that book of yours?

06:06.817 --> 06:10.452
- I did. Yeah.
- Yeah? Fantastic.

06:10.454 --> 06:13.722
- Is that going well for you?
- Um...

06:13.724 --> 06:16.958
Well, the editor/publisher
that got ahold of it

06:16.960 --> 06:19.194
- turned out to be a little bit of a scam.
- Mm.

06:19.196 --> 06:22.564
So I mostly just email
people copies of the PDF.

06:22.566 --> 06:27.403
You know, my fiancé just launched an
SEO ghost-blogging company out in Star.

06:27.405 --> 06:29.771
I'm sure that he would love to
bring you on as a staff writer.

06:29.773 --> 06:33.542
- Um, no, I don't think so.
- Really?

06:33.544 --> 06:40.382
Yeah. I, uh... really only
like to write for myself.

06:40.384 --> 06:44.686
- Same old Ralph.
- What's that supposed to mean?

06:44.688 --> 06:46.322
The whole time we were going out,

06:46.324 --> 06:48.290
you never had any sort of plan.

06:48.292 --> 06:51.893
No. Hold that. Mm!

06:54.832 --> 06:57.766
- So?
- So?

06:57.768 --> 07:01.470
So, look around you, we've all
moved on with our lives, okay?

07:01.472 --> 07:04.440
Whatever it is that you're chasing,
it's probably time to figure it out.

07:04.442 --> 07:08.877
You're in the back half of your 20s,
Ralph, that's all that I'm saying.

07:08.879 --> 07:11.280
Smile!

07:16.987 --> 07:20.256
Fornication. Excuse me.

07:20.258 --> 07:24.260
For an occasion such as this, I felt
it appropriate to say a few words

07:24.262 --> 07:27.596
to the lovely Miss
Grant-hyphen-Smith.

07:27.598 --> 07:30.031
Just kidding, babe. But seriously,

07:30.033 --> 07:31.667
James Joyce writes that,

07:31.669 --> 07:34.636
"Life is in every day, day after day.

07:34.638 --> 07:37.806
We wander through
ourselves, meeting robbers,

07:37.808 --> 07:39.808
ghosts, giants, old men,

07:39.810 --> 07:43.712
young men, wives, widows, brothers in love,

07:43.714 --> 07:46.648
but always meeting ourselves."

07:46.650 --> 07:48.817
Fifteen months ago, I finally met myself

07:48.819 --> 07:51.787
in the soul of the
beautiful woman next to me.

07:51.789 --> 07:56.525
And maybe the wandering is over,
but the journey has just begun.

07:56.527 --> 07:59.561
When I first met Jewels, I knew
I needed to get my act together.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.798
I'd like to think I was a
little bit of a mess back then.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.867
The first time I brought her
home, she spent the first two hours

08:05.869 --> 08:07.636
scrubbing every nook and cranny.

08:12.343 --> 08:14.643
But like I said, the
journey has just begun.

08:14.645 --> 08:17.313
I'm glad we went.

08:17.315 --> 08:19.481
Everybody seems to be doing well.

08:19.483 --> 08:20.682
Too well.

08:20.684 --> 08:24.052
Hey, Ralph?

08:24.054 --> 08:25.556
You'll get there.

08:27.090 --> 08:31.493
- Bedtime?
- Yeah.

08:31.495 --> 08:34.929
- Good night.
- Good night.

08:34.932 --> 08:38.900
Good thing I packed extra in mine or
you'd have a pretty sad little lunch.

08:38.902 --> 08:41.337
- That's what I keep you around for.
- Sure.

08:41.339 --> 08:43.438
- Your car or mine?
- Mine. Yours still smells like

08:43.441 --> 08:46.043
the nachos you left in it last week.

08:51.982 --> 08:54.483
Hey, Bernard, how was bingo last night?

08:54.485 --> 08:58.019
Agnes, that bitch, won the
pot again, five weeks in a row.

08:58.021 --> 09:00.088
- Who does that?
- Agnes, I guess.

09:00.090 --> 09:02.023
Hey, you better hurry,
we're blasting off soon.

09:02.025 --> 09:04.828
- You'll get stuck by Beatrice again.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.733
Yo, Mort, time to take your pills, man.

09:11.735 --> 09:15.704
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa...

09:15.706 --> 09:19.941
Slow down. Good morning, Ralph.

09:19.943 --> 09:23.512
- Good morning, Mort.
- Very good. That's very good.

09:23.514 --> 09:26.014
I'm trying to figure out how to...

09:26.016 --> 09:28.817
figure out this Simple Single
date profile, how to update it.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.787
- I...
- Since when are you on Simply Single?

09:31.789 --> 09:34.423
Well, since you started raving
about it. Don't you remember?

09:34.425 --> 09:36.892
So I figured what's good for me is
good for you is good for me and you.

09:36.894 --> 09:38.760
- All right?
- You're too kind.

09:38.762 --> 09:41.730
Oh, thank you so much. What do
you say, "It's a stellar market"?

09:41.732 --> 09:43.799
That means pretty girls,
that means a lot of them.

09:43.801 --> 09:46.970
- All the babes.
- Ooh, yummies. Scrum Yum.

09:48.606 --> 09:51.875
Yeah, here. Take a look. Go on.

09:53.911 --> 09:55.946
Is this it?

09:58.081 --> 09:59.648
Yeah.

09:59.650 --> 10:02.918
I don't think this is gonna work.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.056
- Why not?
- It doesn't even look like you.

10:07.991 --> 10:09.760
Well, it's an older picture.

10:11.795 --> 10:14.162
Is that you at the Treefort Music Festival?

10:14.164 --> 10:16.031
I Photoshopped it a little bit, all right?

10:16.033 --> 10:18.033
- Mort, you can't do that.
- You keep saying

10:18.035 --> 10:20.101
that I can't do that. Why can't I do that?

10:20.103 --> 10:22.103
What are you gonna do if you
actually meet someone on this?

10:22.105 --> 10:24.107
I'll win her over with my charm.

10:25.909 --> 10:27.943
You say that you're a space cowboy?

10:27.945 --> 10:29.611
Well, "gangster of
love" wouldn't fit, okay?

10:29.613 --> 10:32.583
Give me a break, will ya? Gadzooks.

10:34.952 --> 10:37.719
Hey, Chet, can you come here for a sec?

10:37.721 --> 10:39.955
Help me talk some sense into Mort.

10:39.957 --> 10:42.023
What's up?

10:42.025 --> 10:46.027
- Is that that dating site?
- Yeah.

10:46.029 --> 10:50.966
Whoa. This is brilliant.

10:50.968 --> 10:55.671
No. Let me log into mine. I'll show
you what it's supposed to look like.

10:55.673 --> 10:58.974
Jesus. Why do you do this to yourself?

10:58.976 --> 11:02.077
You look like somebody that has to turn
their porch lights off at Halloween.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.144
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:03.146 --> 11:05.046
And you're not gonna get
laid with that picture,

11:05.048 --> 11:06.114
- I guarantee it.
- Never.

11:06.116 --> 11:07.783
Look, I know you guys think

11:07.785 --> 11:09.551
you're being helpful
right now, but you're not.

11:09.553 --> 11:11.653
This is what you do when you're not here?

11:11.655 --> 11:14.222
Fan fiction writing and
that community center?

11:14.224 --> 11:18.827
Go-carts on the first date? You're a
grown man! You got a driver's license.

11:18.829 --> 11:20.696
- Yeah.
- Hey, Ralph?

11:20.698 --> 11:23.865
- What?
- Um, Bernie, Thomas, and Arnold

11:23.867 --> 11:25.501
spilled their pills
playing their game again

11:25.503 --> 11:27.569
and Evelyn's dog's trying to eat them.

11:27.571 --> 11:30.606
Goddamn it. Be right
there. We're done, guys.

11:30.608 --> 11:32.541
You can figure it out for yourselves.

11:32.543 --> 11:34.576
- Chet, Chet, come here, come here.
- Yeah?

11:34.578 --> 11:38.914
- He needs help.
- Let's do this.

11:38.916 --> 11:41.250
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

11:41.252 --> 11:44.219
I'd suggest first... how about a Speedo?

11:44.221 --> 11:47.623
- Perfect, perfect.
- With the American flag, you know, lots of stars,

11:47.625 --> 11:49.691
- and all of them in the right places.
- Yes, yes.

11:51.128 --> 11:53.629
What are we doing tomorrow?

11:53.631 --> 11:55.697
Uh, I thought we were getting Frostys

11:55.699 --> 11:58.934
- and watching the "Dirty Harry" marathon.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:58.936 --> 12:02.704
Or there's a speed dating thing down at the
elementary school I thought we could go to.

12:02.706 --> 12:04.573
Why would we do that?

12:04.575 --> 12:06.575
Maybe because it might
be nice to do something

12:06.577 --> 12:09.845
besides sitting home eating
left-over pasta tacos?

12:49.253 --> 12:54.790
This is incredible. Oh, my God.

12:54.792 --> 12:58.760
- How did this happen?
- I think I left it open on Mort's phone today.

12:58.762 --> 13:02.731
- Mort did this?
- I think Chet had something to do with it too.

13:02.733 --> 13:05.634
- It's a little classy for Mort.
- Wow.

13:05.636 --> 13:08.370
So apparently you're a
wine baron named "Chooch."

13:08.372 --> 13:12.908
You love to sail. Oh,
and you listen to dubstep.

13:12.910 --> 13:16.144
These pictures are hilarious.

13:16.146 --> 13:21.016
I love the one of you as a Prussian
general, that's a nice touch.

13:21.018 --> 13:23.819
I can't believe all these women
are actually trying to talk to you.

13:23.821 --> 13:26.021
I know!

13:26.023 --> 13:28.223
Well, have fun fixing it, I'm sorry.

13:28.225 --> 13:31.159
I know you spent a lot of time on it.

13:31.161 --> 13:34.780
For reals, though.

13:36.267 --> 13:39.935
Hey, Ralph. You look like hell.

13:39.937 --> 13:42.203
- Well, thanks.
- What's the occasion?

13:42.205 --> 13:44.340
Uh, Maggie and I are going
speed dating after work.

13:44.342 --> 13:47.108
- You got a minute?
- I'm not looking to buy.

13:47.110 --> 13:51.079
- What?
- Sorry, you sort of look like a used car salesman.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.914
That our boy wonder?

13:52.916 --> 13:55.784
Tell him we're 50 years
above his demographic.

13:55.786 --> 13:58.854
Look, if you guys aren't gonna
be serious, I gotta get going.

13:58.856 --> 14:01.222
Oh, no, no, no, not like that.

14:01.224 --> 14:04.293
Oh, shit. Follow me.

14:04.295 --> 14:06.862
Hey, Ralphie, baby, how are you?

14:06.864 --> 14:10.766
Fine. So you guys had some fun
with my dating profile last night.

14:10.768 --> 14:12.934
Yeah, we looked at it this morning
and you hadn't changed it back,

14:12.936 --> 14:15.337
- so you must've approved.
- Not really.

14:15.339 --> 14:18.974
Oh, no? Well, I'm pretty sure
you got more messages on there

14:18.976 --> 14:23.279
in the last 20 or so hours than you
have the entire three months on there.

14:23.281 --> 14:27.182
Here, try this on. You
know, Ralph, we get it.

14:27.184 --> 14:32.220
You know, you're set on being you, but
it's such a waste of a good-looking guy.

14:32.222 --> 14:37.393
So why don't you just quit
being such a Nancy, and let us...

14:37.395 --> 14:40.762
or me, help you.

14:40.764 --> 14:45.867
And do something with your hair.
You look like a fruity barber.

14:45.869 --> 14:48.904
This isn't really my style, guys.

14:48.906 --> 14:52.040
You wanna know somethin'?
Ralph, you don't have a style.

14:52.042 --> 14:55.176
Okay? I'm sure you did
just fine the way you did,

14:55.178 --> 14:58.747
fumbling around in the
first of your years, okay?

14:58.749 --> 15:02.751
But your age group has
moved on. You haven't.

15:02.753 --> 15:04.720
When's the last time you got laid?

15:04.722 --> 15:06.255
When's the last time you got laid?

15:06.257 --> 15:08.724
This morning.

15:08.726 --> 15:10.992
Well, maybe I don't kiss and tell.

15:10.994 --> 15:14.029
Well, you gotta kiss
before you can tell, okay?

15:14.031 --> 15:17.032
You know, I just want you to
ask yourself what it is you want.

15:17.034 --> 15:19.501
Maybe not just with the
women, but what else?

15:19.503 --> 15:22.971
I mean, you've got to at least fake like
you're chasing it even if you aren't.

15:22.973 --> 15:27.343
- Mort, give me the glasses.
- Huh?

15:27.345 --> 15:31.880
We just want to show you the Ralph that
you're apparently so afraid of being.

15:31.882 --> 15:36.051
You know, throw you a proxy that
you can exploit and write on.

15:36.053 --> 15:38.854
And get to know that
profile we made for you.

15:38.856 --> 15:40.889
And try being that guy tonight.

15:40.891 --> 15:43.091
Now, you know how to use
Mort's glasses, right?

15:43.093 --> 15:45.527
- Yeah, I helped him set them up.
- Great.

15:45.529 --> 15:48.899
Call us when you get there,
we'll get you through it.

15:55.873 --> 15:58.173
- I feel ridiculous.
- Really?

15:58.175 --> 16:01.345
I was gonna say I'm excited
you're taking this seriously.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.980
Right.

16:04.982 --> 16:09.017
So can everybody be seated?
We're about to start.

16:09.019 --> 16:12.856
Uh, gentlemen on the
inside, ladies on the out.

16:16.960 --> 16:20.431
Oh, look! Look, look!
There he is. There he is.

16:22.165 --> 16:24.165
- How we doin', Ralph?
- Fine.

16:24.167 --> 16:27.403
- You ready for this?
- Not really.

16:27.405 --> 16:30.339
- You want any more of this?
- No.

16:30.341 --> 16:35.479
- Hey, I'm Sal.
- Um, and you are...?

16:37.448 --> 16:41.417
- Chooch.
- Is that your last name?

16:41.419 --> 16:44.322
No.

16:47.024 --> 16:51.560
Sorry, kid. We just wanted to be sure
you'd say whatever we told you to.

16:51.562 --> 16:54.430
- Like a train.
- Yeah, tell her it's just exactly like a train.

16:54.432 --> 16:57.333
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.

16:57.335 --> 17:01.102
- So, what do you do for work?
- Okay, here's what you're gonna say.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.872
- "I believe the..."
- ...the supreme accomplishment is to blur the lines

17:03.874 --> 17:07.876
between work and play. So
my work isn't really work.

17:07.877 --> 17:10.979
- It's my passion.
- Oh!

17:10.981 --> 17:13.315
Oh, wow, that's beautiful.

17:13.317 --> 17:16.252
Oh, my God, I love love!

17:16.253 --> 17:19.020
Almost as much as I love cats.

17:21.459 --> 17:24.125
- I have a lot of cats.
- A lot of cats.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.528
Here he is, dressed like a pirate.

17:26.530 --> 17:28.364
And here he is pretending
to be at the beach.

17:28.366 --> 17:30.231
Of course, I didn't really take him.

17:30.233 --> 17:33.101
His name is Meow Capone.

17:33.103 --> 17:36.004
- I don't have a cat.
- Interesting.

17:36.006 --> 17:39.240
But I gotta ask, do the
curtains match the drapes?

17:39.242 --> 17:43.111
Oh, you're terrible.

17:43.113 --> 17:44.580
It's true.

17:44.582 --> 17:48.116
Bullshit speed dating
goddamn waste of time.

17:48.118 --> 17:52.187
- Shit!
- Not the cupcakes!

17:52.189 --> 17:55.991
You know, starving kids in China would
have been happy to have had these.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.226
By kids in China, you do mean you, right?

17:58.228 --> 18:02.130
Because I saw you shoving them
down at that wedding on Sunday.

18:02.132 --> 18:05.567
That's right. I thought you
looked familiar, the caterer.

18:05.569 --> 18:08.136
- Obviously.
- Quinn.

18:08.138 --> 18:10.508
Ralph.

18:13.277 --> 18:16.578
- So you have any luck in there?
- Uh, no.

18:16.580 --> 18:19.515
I don't think I have enough room in
my house for that many litter boxes.

18:19.517 --> 18:22.418
That was really nice,
thanks for helping me.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.320
Yeah, no problem.

18:24.322 --> 18:26.187
You should let me buy you a drink.

18:26.189 --> 18:29.558
- You don't need to do that.
- I want to.

18:29.560 --> 18:33.329
- Well, okay, then.
- Okay.

18:33.331 --> 18:37.999
I gotta finish up here. You wanna meet
me at 10th Street Station in an hour?

18:38.001 --> 18:40.235
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- All right.

18:40.237 --> 18:43.106
- Okay.
- I'll see you there.

18:49.513 --> 18:53.582
- Who was that?
- I got cupcake on my hand.

19:06.397 --> 19:07.529
- Hey!
- Hey.

19:07.531 --> 19:08.964
Glad you could make it.

19:08.966 --> 19:11.500
- Everyone, this is Ralph.
- Hello.

19:11.502 --> 19:13.735
So, you been hanging out
with those crazy cat ladies?

19:13.737 --> 19:18.274
Yeah, you get those cat
ladies' numbers there?

19:18.276 --> 19:21.277
- Sorry, Ralph, I couldn't help it.
- It's fine.

19:21.279 --> 19:24.012
So I actually met Ralph at
that wedding I did last weekend.

19:24.014 --> 19:25.681
I heard you saying you published a book?

19:25.683 --> 19:28.350
Yeah, well, self-published.

19:28.352 --> 19:31.553
- So, what's it about?
- Uh, well it's about a time traveler.

19:31.555 --> 19:35.023
He discovers a machine and
decides to go back five years.

19:35.025 --> 19:38.527
Um, then as soon he gets in, he
realizes it only works in real time,

19:38.529 --> 19:42.097
so to go back five years
it takes him five years.

19:42.099 --> 19:46.001
You wrote a book about that?

19:46.003 --> 19:48.470
Yeah, I mean, it's sort of existential.

19:48.472 --> 19:50.205
Sounds like you, Quinn.

19:50.207 --> 19:53.642
- Shut it.
- Well, so we all met in college.

19:53.644 --> 19:57.145
- Quinn started in English.
- It's okay. She figured it out eventually.

19:57.147 --> 20:00.081
- -Who the hell studies
English post-millennium?

20:00.083 --> 20:03.018
- You go to school, Ralph?
- I did, yeah.

20:03.020 --> 20:06.056
- What did you study?
- English.

20:08.692 --> 20:10.492
So, who wants a shot?

20:10.494 --> 20:12.093
- Yes!
- Everyone.

20:12.095 --> 20:13.228
- Definitely.
- Two!

20:30.714 --> 20:34.416
- I think I'm gonna take off.
- Really?

20:34.418 --> 20:38.487
- Thanks, that was fun.
- Don't do that.

20:38.489 --> 20:42.391
- What do you mean?
- Don't say you had a good time if you didn't.

20:42.393 --> 20:44.225
Well, what do you want? I
mean, they're your friends.

20:44.227 --> 20:46.262
I didn't have a whole lot to contribute.

20:46.264 --> 20:48.096
Look, you seem like a cool guy,

20:48.098 --> 20:51.166
but I was hoping this
would have gone better.

20:51.168 --> 20:54.336
- Why?
- Because I thought we could have had fun hanging out.

20:54.338 --> 20:58.307
Why didn't we, then? I mean,
why start off with this?

20:58.309 --> 21:01.343
I figured the whole group thing
would've chilled you out a little.

21:01.345 --> 21:06.350
They were just joking around
and you're kind of missing out.

21:08.218 --> 21:10.153
Okay.

21:12.089 --> 21:16.260
Okay, whatever. Have a good night, I guess.

21:31.375 --> 21:34.643
You know where I could,
um, score any hits of Molly?

21:34.645 --> 21:36.578
- No.
- You sure?

21:36.580 --> 21:38.380
- Yeah, I'm positive.
- I thought that's

21:38.382 --> 21:39.781
what you young kids were doing nowadays.

21:39.783 --> 21:41.283
What do you call it, "parachuting,"

21:41.285 --> 21:43.118
"rushing in," what's that word? Huh?

21:43.120 --> 21:45.321
- Phat?
- A-ha! Phat!

21:45.323 --> 21:47.256
Wrong way, Ruth, we're meeting up front.

21:47.258 --> 21:50.225
Turn around, honey, turn
around, let's go this way.

21:50.227 --> 21:53.362
Come on! Come on!

21:53.364 --> 21:55.797
Yeah, Mollys. I'd like
to try them at least once.

21:55.799 --> 21:57.366
I ever tell you the story about these?

21:57.368 --> 21:59.134
- Like a thousand times.
- Oh, yeah?

21:59.136 --> 22:00.836
I'm gonna tell you again.
They were my wife's.

22:00.838 --> 22:02.638
When she passed away, I
said I'd keep her near me.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.576
So guess what? She's around my neck.

22:07.578 --> 22:11.447
- What happened to you?
- Gladys made a couple improvements.

22:11.449 --> 22:13.882
You look weird. All right,
I'm gonna get the bus.

22:13.884 --> 22:16.318
- Everybody here?
- Chet's not here.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.521
- Where's Chet?
- Probably another late night with Beatrice.

22:19.523 --> 22:22.223
Oh. Oh, hi, Beatrice.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.099
Well, hello, ladies.

22:31.802 --> 22:33.635
All right, all right, hey!

22:33.637 --> 22:36.472
I want everyone to calm
down and knock it off!

22:36.474 --> 22:39.308
- Or else what?
- Or else we're not stopping

22:39.310 --> 22:41.377
by the giant cookie kiosk on the way out!

22:41.379 --> 22:43.279
- Oh!
- Oh, man!

22:43.281 --> 22:45.847
But I love giant cookies.

22:45.849 --> 22:48.484
Mort, what the hell, man?!

22:48.486 --> 22:50.786
The diseases I have, it helps, you know.

22:50.788 --> 22:52.721
Put it out!

23:03.901 --> 23:05.503
Thanks.

23:07.838 --> 23:11.273
- Who's your friend?
- Oh, that's Pete.

23:11.275 --> 23:13.208
Ralph gave him to me.

23:13.210 --> 23:17.779
Said he was lonely, we might
keep each other company.

23:17.781 --> 23:20.516
He's so sweet, Ralph.

23:20.518 --> 23:23.719
It's too bad you can't get it on together.

23:23.721 --> 23:25.587
I think you have the
wrong idea there, love.

23:25.589 --> 23:27.389
Ralph and I don't operate that way.

23:27.391 --> 23:29.891
- Oh, such a shame.
- It is, isn't it?

23:29.893 --> 23:31.262
Mm-hm.

23:36.434 --> 23:40.436
- So, it was kind of a bust?
- God, it was awful.

23:40.438 --> 23:42.904
Okay, so, no bitterness
at all, that's good.

23:42.906 --> 23:46.908
I'm just tired of a bunch of people sitting
around a bar with a superiority complex

23:46.910 --> 23:49.645
congratulating themselves
for settling on second place.

23:49.647 --> 23:52.448
Well, what are you doing that's so great?

23:52.450 --> 23:54.015
You bitch about people settling.

23:54.017 --> 23:56.618
You're nothing more than
a glorified babysitter.

23:56.620 --> 23:59.888
I love you to death, Ralphie, but this
better not be your first place, either.

23:59.890 --> 24:03.859
No, this is just something that's keeping
me afloat while I work on better stuff.

24:03.861 --> 24:06.528
You've been on the same
pay grade for five years.

24:06.530 --> 24:08.830
And they still make
you wash your own smock.

24:08.832 --> 24:12.401
That's not entirely true.
I got a raise last year.

24:12.403 --> 24:14.936
That's not the point.

24:14.938 --> 24:18.407
I just don't think it would help any.

24:18.409 --> 24:21.510
You don't? You don't
think that making yourself

24:21.512 --> 24:23.412
more presentable, more stable,

24:23.414 --> 24:25.681
more in tune with reality,
would help you any?

24:25.683 --> 24:28.550
Make you less of the mope
I've watched you become?

24:28.552 --> 24:32.020
I'm only a mope because I'm so tired of
everyone telling me what to do all the time.

24:32.022 --> 24:34.890
- Well, can you blame them?
- Yeah, if I want to.

24:34.892 --> 24:38.894
So you think that... and
as much as I love Maggie,

24:38.896 --> 24:42.331
but playing house with some silly airhead

24:42.333 --> 24:45.534
who's not even giving you any
while you work a nothing job

24:45.536 --> 24:50.408
and try to write some sappy science
fiction rag is the best thing for you?

24:52.776 --> 24:54.843
So Gladys thinks we should get it on.

24:54.845 --> 24:57.379
Of course she does.

24:57.381 --> 25:00.782
Why can't everyone just
leave our love alone?

25:00.784 --> 25:05.989
- ♪ Secret lovers ♪
- Okay, you're done.

25:08.426 --> 25:10.559
I was sort of getting
the opposite from Chet.

25:10.561 --> 25:13.995
- That's not like him.
- Not at all.

25:13.997 --> 25:16.332
"But I just can't quit you, Ralphie!"

25:16.334 --> 25:18.469
Okay, you're done.

25:20.371 --> 25:21.903
How we doing on time?

25:21.905 --> 25:24.440
We're probably due back
here pretty quick for lunch.

25:24.442 --> 25:26.875
Think Sandy will be pissed
if I ruin their appetites?

25:26.877 --> 25:30.281
Gonna spring for the
big cookie, eh? Pushover.

25:32.983 --> 25:37.486
Are we missing someone? Who are we missing?

25:37.488 --> 25:39.657
Help!

25:44.395 --> 25:46.695
Nice, Ralph.

25:46.697 --> 25:50.766
I was going to see if you
were ready, but obviously not.

25:50.768 --> 25:53.802
- Ready for what?
- Record Exchange?

26:02.012 --> 26:03.612
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:03.614 --> 26:06.848
How do I look?

26:06.850 --> 26:09.385
Every time. Look!

26:09.387 --> 26:11.019
- "Witches Brew!"
- I know!

26:11.021 --> 26:12.654
That's the one you've
been looking for, right?

26:12.656 --> 26:14.956
- Like forever.
- You should get it.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.892
- Eh...
- Oh.

26:16.894 --> 26:19.060
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

26:21.064 --> 26:23.599
So, what are you wearing tonight?

26:23.601 --> 26:27.969
- What do you mean?
- Pretty much how it sounds. I don't know.

26:27.971 --> 26:31.740
Probably just what I'm
wearing right now, I guess.

26:31.742 --> 26:33.909
Did you seriously forget about the gala?

26:33.911 --> 26:38.814
- What gala?
- Ralph, the Ward Hooper Gala to stop elderly abuse.

26:38.816 --> 26:40.416
God, that's tonight, isn't it?

26:40.418 --> 26:43.118
Yep, and you've known about it for months.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.821
Probably wouldn't look too
good if I missed it, would it?

26:45.823 --> 26:49.090
Probably not. Half of the
residents are gonna be there.

26:49.092 --> 26:53.695
- Shit.
- You didn't even buy a ticket, did you?

26:53.697 --> 26:56.898
- Ralph!
- I'm sorry! I forgot.

26:56.900 --> 27:00.001
Well, Gladys did give me her extra ticket,

27:00.003 --> 27:03.104
and her family won't
let her go out anymore.

27:03.106 --> 27:07.676
It's probably more important
that you show up than my sister.

27:07.678 --> 27:11.447
- Well, do you have a date?
- You're funny.

27:11.449 --> 27:13.682
- You wanna be mine?
- Really?

27:13.684 --> 27:15.018
Yeah.

27:16.987 --> 27:19.020
Well, yeah.

27:19.022 --> 27:21.890
Sure. It might be nice, actually.

27:21.892 --> 27:25.160
- Great.
- Do you have anything to wear?

27:25.162 --> 27:28.464
I mean, I have something, if
you want. Might work for you.

27:28.466 --> 27:29.865
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:29.867 --> 27:32.601
- How?
- Picked up a suit a while ago.

27:32.603 --> 27:35.471
I think it looks pretty
sharp, but, I don't know,

27:35.473 --> 27:38.540
thinking someday you
might want to try it on.

27:38.542 --> 27:40.175
Do you think it would look okay?

27:40.177 --> 27:42.544
I think it would look awesome.

27:42.546 --> 27:46.515
- Well, great. Let's do it.
- Okay.

28:27.925 --> 28:31.059
- Ralph. Lookin' good, buddy!
- Thanks.

28:31.061 --> 28:34.029
- You tie that yourself?
- I did, yeah.

28:34.031 --> 28:37.065
- It took me a while, though.
- Take a look at that beauty.

28:37.067 --> 28:40.636
Shit.

28:40.638 --> 28:44.540
It's that girl I was telling you about
from the other night, the caterer.

28:44.542 --> 28:48.644
- So, what's the problem?
- I sort of made an ass out of myself that night.

28:48.646 --> 28:51.280
Well, you know, I always believe

28:51.282 --> 28:53.114
that if you weren't making
an ass out of yourself

28:53.116 --> 28:55.851
60 percent of the time
you're not really trying.

28:55.853 --> 28:59.955
Right, but it was more like the insecure
ass, and not so much the "go get 'em" ass.

28:59.957 --> 29:03.224
Oh, okay. Uh, well, ya know,

29:03.226 --> 29:06.161
just go by and say hi, be nice,

29:06.163 --> 29:09.265
maybe a little chitchat,
and it'll all be over.

29:09.267 --> 29:11.032
She'll forget it ever happened.

29:11.034 --> 29:12.200
There's a lot of people here.

29:12.202 --> 29:15.904
I think she's with someone.

29:15.906 --> 29:19.675
Boy, she's really got you in a bunch, huh?

29:19.677 --> 29:21.810
You're actually starting to care.

29:21.812 --> 29:24.079
Maybe she's just what you've been needing.

29:24.081 --> 29:26.247
I don't know. What if I say something dumb?

29:26.249 --> 29:28.149
Well, I'll be honest with you, Ralph,

29:28.151 --> 29:30.319
that's probably what will happen.

29:30.321 --> 29:33.121
But listen, folks will try and tell you

29:33.123 --> 29:35.056
there are two types of
people in this world.

29:35.058 --> 29:38.159
There are those who march
in the ticker tape parade

29:38.161 --> 29:42.798
and there are those who sit back
and imagine that's them in the ranks.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.666
But I can guarantee you,

29:44.668 --> 29:47.636
every one of them was bluffing
at one point or another.

29:47.638 --> 29:50.839
But you don't win by
being the best bluffer.

29:50.841 --> 29:54.676
You win by knowing when
to call the other guy out.

29:54.678 --> 29:56.678
The cards have already been dealt.

29:56.680 --> 29:59.781
Nothing you can do to change
the hands, so call 'em out.

29:59.783 --> 30:06.054
Call 'em all out. Take that
hand and smash 'em. Huh?

30:06.056 --> 30:07.825
Wow.

30:09.893 --> 30:11.329
Go get 'em.

30:24.408 --> 30:29.345
I actually wrote my doctoral thesis
at Stanford on Duke Wellington.

30:29.347 --> 30:33.882
This very number actually, which
he won the Newbery for in 1956.

30:33.884 --> 30:37.986
This piece was the greatest
thing he'd ever done for the art.

30:37.988 --> 30:40.155
You know, it's funny you'd
say that, because, uh,

30:40.157 --> 30:44.426
Duke Ellington never won a Newbery
because he never wrote any books.

30:44.428 --> 30:50.932
He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in
'56 which he was shockingly turned down for.

30:50.934 --> 30:54.135
And he always said that his attempts
to fuse Christian liturgy with jazz

30:54.137 --> 30:56.104
to be the greatest thing
he'd done for the art.

30:56.106 --> 30:59.343
And also... this is Count Basie.

31:01.745 --> 31:05.283
- Wanna check out some art?
- I'd love to.

31:11.188 --> 31:13.922
- I can't believe you did that.
- Why?

31:13.924 --> 31:17.793
I don't know, it was really forward.

31:17.795 --> 31:21.430
- You want to get out of here?
- And do what?

31:21.432 --> 31:23.865
I don't know. Go swimming.

31:23.867 --> 31:25.903
Oh, you're serious?

32:39.477 --> 32:41.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:43.847 --> 32:46.448
How was your night?

32:46.450 --> 32:49.285
It was really good, actually.

32:49.287 --> 32:52.756
Sorry about taking off. I honestly
thought we'd be back up, but...

32:54.224 --> 32:57.959
- It's all right.
- How'd your night go?

32:57.961 --> 33:00.731
- It was awesome. I had fun.
- Yeah?

33:02.466 --> 33:03.932
Do you want me to make some breakfast?

33:03.934 --> 33:06.134
Uh, no, I actually had

33:06.136 --> 33:08.437
some yogurt over at Quinn's.

33:08.439 --> 33:11.340
She had to blast off for
an early morning yoga.

33:11.342 --> 33:13.875
- So you knew her.
- I did, yeah.

33:13.877 --> 33:16.345
She was that girl I met up
with at the speed dating event.

33:16.347 --> 33:18.580
Oh, I thought you blew it with her.

33:18.582 --> 33:22.251
So did I, but I guess I fixed it.

33:22.253 --> 33:25.587
Cool. So you two like
a thing, now? What's up?

33:25.589 --> 33:28.490
Uh... I don't know.

33:28.492 --> 33:32.361
She said to give her a call later
this afternoon, so we'll see.

33:32.363 --> 33:35.533
- Cool.
- I'm gonna head to back to bed.

33:52.182 --> 33:53.982
- Hm...
- Hm?

33:53.984 --> 33:56.552
- What else do you want me to say?
- I don't know.

33:56.554 --> 33:59.087
You didn't think I could do
it. Said I didn't have enough

33:59.089 --> 34:01.290
going for me to warrant
finding anyone worth my while.

34:01.292 --> 34:02.924
And do you think she's worth your while?

34:02.926 --> 34:05.060
Of course she is.

34:05.062 --> 34:08.429
So admit it. You were wrong. I
do have something going for me

34:08.431 --> 34:10.466
and I don't need your
approval to be with someone.

34:10.467 --> 34:13.402
Then why are you looking for it now?

34:13.404 --> 34:17.105
- Listen, Ralph.
- Rexlor 2135.

34:17.107 --> 34:21.476
Right. Listen, you don't
need anyone's approval.

34:21.478 --> 34:24.313
The only person that needs
to be happy here is you.

34:24.315 --> 34:27.882
Then why am I here? Why are you here,

34:27.885 --> 34:30.918
practically haunting me, making
me go through all of this?

34:30.920 --> 34:33.655
To make sure that who you
both end up with is real

34:33.657 --> 34:37.926
and not some fictitious version of yourselves
that you'll either have to conform to or...

34:37.928 --> 34:40.962
I can't read this anymore. Holy shit!

34:40.964 --> 34:43.231
- Franco.
- No, I'm serious!

34:43.233 --> 34:45.534
This is the exact same
thing as last time...

34:45.536 --> 34:47.936
All right. This isn't awful.

34:47.938 --> 34:50.170
But I still say you need to dig deeper.

34:50.172 --> 34:54.208
And I agree with the others that
it seems like an ode to your ex.

34:54.210 --> 34:58.447
Damn, dude. When's the
last time you got laid?

34:58.449 --> 34:59.983
This morning.

35:04.655 --> 35:08.457
Do you enjoy the three S's?

35:08.459 --> 35:12.528
Sunsets, Champagne, Chardonnay?

35:12.530 --> 35:16.164
I should have made you wait in the car.

35:16.166 --> 35:19.034
Here's one: "A delightfully
complex blonde."

35:19.036 --> 35:22.971
Just like you.

35:22.973 --> 35:26.174
Better than this one: "Fruity,
flamboyant and flabby."

35:26.176 --> 35:27.411
Like you!

35:34.184 --> 35:36.487
That's a better one than what I got here.

35:39.022 --> 35:42.258
- Boy, old Mort's on a roll, huh?
- Yeah, he is.

35:42.260 --> 35:46.295
- You want in on the pool?
- You running a book on this?

35:46.297 --> 35:50.098
You bet. Five to one odds on Mort.

35:50.100 --> 35:52.534
- Beatrice always wins.
- Not today, boy.

35:52.536 --> 35:55.304
Well, what, did Mort just discover Adderall

35:55.306 --> 35:57.573
and spend the whole
night reading Wikipedia?

35:57.575 --> 35:59.641
That's close. It's an
episode from last month

35:59.643 --> 36:03.545
he recorded and memorized. He's
just playing it back on the TV.

36:03.547 --> 36:04.613
You're kidding.

36:04.615 --> 36:06.382
No.

36:06.384 --> 36:08.116
Again? Oh!

36:08.118 --> 36:11.253
You know, I need to talk to you. Come on.

36:11.255 --> 36:13.389
You got your gift for Quinn yet?

36:13.391 --> 36:15.291
What do you mean?

36:15.293 --> 36:17.459
Well, it's your "three month," isn't it?

36:17.461 --> 36:19.661
Does that really constitute
the need for a gift, though?

36:19.663 --> 36:23.699
Have you never heard of women? Jesus.

36:23.701 --> 36:30.105
I don't care if it's defined or not,
but ignoring tonight is a lose-lose deal.

36:30.107 --> 36:32.510
So why not make a big deal out of it?

36:38.081 --> 36:42.453
This is a necklace I gave my
wife soon after we started dating.

36:46.290 --> 36:50.526
I don't know what to say. I, uh,
always forget you were married.

36:50.528 --> 36:53.795
Yeah, well... I'm proud of you.

36:53.797 --> 36:58.166
You're really pulling things together.

36:58.168 --> 37:00.302
By the way, what's up
with Maggie these days?

37:00.304 --> 37:01.737
What do you mean?

37:01.739 --> 37:03.772
Well, Mort asked for his key allowance

37:03.774 --> 37:07.108
for the month a week early.
She really reamed him for it.

37:07.110 --> 37:10.281
He's got a date tonight, he
wants to take his convertible out.

37:12.215 --> 37:14.316
Yeah, things have been
kind of weird there too.

37:14.318 --> 37:16.285
Oh, you think?

37:16.287 --> 37:18.620
You really walked into
this blind, didn't you.

37:18.622 --> 37:23.224
Like, I'm home and stuff, but
I'm also at Quinn's a lot too,

37:23.226 --> 37:26.094
- just not exclusively.
- Glad to hear it.

37:26.096 --> 37:27.829
I just get the feeling that
neither one is that enthused

37:27.831 --> 37:29.565
with where I spend most of my time.

37:29.567 --> 37:30.832
There we go.

37:30.834 --> 37:32.401
Knew you'd finally get to it.

37:32.403 --> 37:35.371
Do you leave her alone with Maggie much?

37:35.373 --> 37:38.607
- Maybe.
- Well, no wonder she's been so bitchy lately.

37:38.609 --> 37:41.677
That might not be the best
way to phrase that, but...

37:41.679 --> 37:45.347
Yeah, well, that's
because you don't see it.

37:45.349 --> 37:47.349
You're busy getting busy.

37:47.351 --> 37:48.850
But you should take care of that.

37:48.852 --> 37:51.188
Mort needs his keys. Huh?

38:17.481 --> 38:19.683
Come on.

38:24.422 --> 38:26.154
All right.

38:27.458 --> 38:28.857
Goddamn it!

38:39.537 --> 38:41.537
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:41.539 --> 38:45.173
- I gotcha something.
- You didn't have to do that.

38:45.175 --> 38:46.775
I feel like I kind of did, though.

38:46.777 --> 38:49.811
Um, I don't know, I just
wanted to say that I'm sorry.

38:49.813 --> 38:51.813
I know that lately I've
kind of been acting like a...

38:51.815 --> 38:57.455
- Douche waffle.
- I was gonna say jerk, but... that works.

39:06.430 --> 39:08.730
- Thank you.
- Throw it on.

39:08.732 --> 39:11.900
Been wanting to hear what
all the fuss is about.

39:11.902 --> 39:15.871
Hey, does it bug you
when I have Quinn over?

39:15.873 --> 39:18.640
Yeah, sometimes she gets to me.

39:18.642 --> 39:22.711
It's not something I can really
point out. It's really okay, though.

39:22.713 --> 39:25.814
- You sure?
- Yeah.

39:25.816 --> 39:28.550
I'll try not to leave the
two of you alone anymore.

39:28.552 --> 39:31.653
Ralph, it's okay. Really.

39:31.655 --> 39:34.590
Is everything going okay with you two?

39:34.592 --> 39:38.327
- Yeah, I guess.
- You don't sound so sure.

39:40.864 --> 39:44.266
I don't know, we're celebrating
our "three month" tonight.

39:44.268 --> 39:48.604
And they said you kids would never make it!

39:48.606 --> 39:50.606
I'm sorry. Go on.

39:50.608 --> 39:53.409
I don't know, I just feel like
things are moving kind of fast.

39:53.411 --> 39:57.212
She keeps bringing up commitment
and moving in and stuff like that,

39:57.214 --> 39:59.415
but I guess after hearing
this, maybe it's more

39:59.417 --> 40:02.818
she wants me out of here
than she wants me in there.

40:02.820 --> 40:04.520
I doubt that's the case.

40:04.522 --> 40:06.588
She probably just wants to
spend more time with you.

40:06.590 --> 40:08.957
I know I would, if I was getting any.

40:08.959 --> 40:10.592
Just kind of makes me nervous.

40:10.594 --> 40:13.196
That's the story of everyone's life, right?

40:14.965 --> 40:17.599
What do you do?

40:17.601 --> 40:20.671
- You wanna dance?
- Okay.

40:23.741 --> 40:27.343
It's good, right?

40:27.345 --> 40:30.011
Thanks for the record.

40:30.013 --> 40:33.515
Yeah.

40:36.354 --> 40:37.986
So, what did you do today?

40:37.988 --> 40:41.022
Uh, well, work, and then I
went to the Record Exchange.

40:41.024 --> 40:43.459
- Oh, yeah, did you get anything?
- I did, yeah.

40:43.461 --> 40:46.862
I picked up a, uh, album for Maggie.

40:46.864 --> 40:48.499
Oh.

40:51.535 --> 40:53.369
Are you cool with Maggie?

40:53.371 --> 40:55.604
Of course, I think she's adorable.

40:55.606 --> 40:57.506
Uh-huh.

40:57.508 --> 41:01.712
She's cute. It's admirable
the way she just goes for it.

41:03.547 --> 41:05.814
Is she the reason you
want me to move in so bad?

41:05.816 --> 41:08.717
Ralph, I want you to
move in because I like you

41:08.719 --> 41:10.786
and I like having you around.

41:10.788 --> 41:14.492
You almost live here already as it is.

41:21.765 --> 41:23.432
I just think three months is too soon.

41:23.434 --> 41:25.601
It's not, though.

41:25.603 --> 41:27.969
And I think you're in a rut.

41:27.971 --> 41:30.539
There's a lot more you
could be doing with yourself,

41:30.541 --> 41:35.311
and I can't help but think it has
something to do with your living situation.

41:35.313 --> 41:37.913
- So it is Maggie.
- No, it's you.

41:37.915 --> 41:40.849
You've been working at the same job,

41:40.851 --> 41:42.784
living at the same place for four years.

41:42.786 --> 41:44.953
- Five years.
- And that's great.

41:44.955 --> 41:48.792
If you love the people there, you
can always do some volunteering.

41:50.794 --> 41:53.061
If you just get out and move on,

41:53.063 --> 41:57.699
you'll be so much happier with
your life and with yourself,

41:57.701 --> 42:02.070
and I think a change in living
situation might help kick-start that.

42:02.072 --> 42:05.441
Just think about it, maybe.

42:05.443 --> 42:09.480
If you're worried about the rent, I can
definitely cover it until you get more situated.

42:14.084 --> 42:19.555
Ohhh! Hello, Ralph! What do you say?

42:19.557 --> 42:21.457
Hey, guys.

42:21.459 --> 42:23.859
So what, Maggie let you
have your keys back early?

42:23.861 --> 42:26.828
Nope. We broke into the
office and stole them.

42:26.830 --> 42:29.465
Nice work. Hey, by the way, this is Quinn.

42:29.467 --> 42:32.368
- Hi, Quinn!
- How are you? Nice to see you.

42:32.370 --> 42:35.571
All right, we got a full tank of gas to
burn, so you kids have fun, all right?

42:35.573 --> 42:37.506
Hey, stay out of trouble, all right?

42:37.508 --> 42:39.477
Bye! Bye!

42:40.411 --> 42:41.677
I can't wait for that.

42:41.679 --> 42:43.812
- Wait for what?
- Second childhood.

42:43.814 --> 42:45.914
I didn't know we were done with the first.

42:45.916 --> 42:47.818
Well, some of us are.

42:53.657 --> 42:57.859
- Ralph White.
- Hey! What are you doing here?

42:57.861 --> 42:59.761
Uh, I'm actually performing here tonight.

42:59.763 --> 43:02.163
Oh. You two, uh, know each other?

43:02.165 --> 43:05.767
We just met in the bathroom. Quinn
recognized me from the Taylor wedding.

43:05.769 --> 43:07.168
Uh-huh.

43:07.170 --> 43:09.538
Yeah, Lorane just asked me to cater hers.

43:09.540 --> 43:12.641
- Whoops!
- Great.

43:12.643 --> 43:15.511
Uh, you two talk about
anything else in there?

43:15.513 --> 43:18.914
Oh, you know, the "ushe." We swapped
embarrassing stories about you.

43:18.916 --> 43:21.483
Joked about that goofy laugh
you do when you get nervous.

43:21.485 --> 43:25.421
I'm gonna go grab that empty
table before we lose it.

43:25.423 --> 43:27.956
- Wanna grab the martinis?
- Yeah.

43:27.958 --> 43:29.827
Bye.

43:31.495 --> 43:35.431
- So she seems nice.
- You think so?

43:35.433 --> 43:40.436
I don't know, all Maggie ever does is comment
on how flat and disinterested she seems.

43:40.438 --> 43:43.171
Hm... So how's it all going?

43:43.173 --> 43:46.975
Are you really asking or do you already
know from your little bathroom chat?

43:46.977 --> 43:49.745
- What?
- I got your number.

43:49.747 --> 43:54.182
Okay, so maybe we talked a little bit.

43:54.184 --> 43:57.986
- She mention the whole moving in thing?
- No.

43:57.988 --> 44:00.088
Oh.

44:00.090 --> 44:03.191
You know, she really likes you, Ralph.

44:03.193 --> 44:08.764
And I think that you owe it to the both of
you to, you know, step it up a little bit.

44:08.766 --> 44:14.002
I always wish you that would have tried
a little harder when we were still dating.

44:14.004 --> 44:17.238
Yeah. Well, that was different.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.910
I loved you.

44:21.779 --> 44:26.247
Yeah, well, maybe that's something
that you need to think about.

44:26.249 --> 44:31.186
At our age, you either call it
love or you need to call it quits.

44:31.188 --> 44:33.789
So, martinis?

44:33.791 --> 44:37.125
It's not exactly your
trademark Rainier with a lime.

44:37.127 --> 44:40.562
Yeah. I mean, Quinn's trying
to broaden my horizons.

44:40.564 --> 44:44.768
- How very cosmopolitan.
- Very cosmopolitan, indeed.

44:53.711 --> 44:55.277
Oh, good, you remembered the extra olives.

44:55.279 --> 44:58.780
Yeah, well, you texted me to remind me

44:58.782 --> 45:00.849
while I was up there, how could I forget?

45:00.851 --> 45:06.023
- So Lorane seems nice.
- Yeah.

45:08.626 --> 45:11.560
Listen, Quinn.

45:11.562 --> 45:15.130
People keep saying that we
have this almost great thing,

45:15.132 --> 45:19.901
and that if I step it up
a bit, it would be great.

45:19.903 --> 45:22.904
And I think that's just it, you know.

45:22.906 --> 45:25.774
If it actually were great,

45:25.776 --> 45:27.543
I wouldn't need to step it up.

45:27.545 --> 45:30.013
I wouldn't have to change who I am.

45:32.049 --> 45:33.715
But it's not.

45:33.717 --> 45:37.253
And I think the fact that without one of us

45:37.255 --> 45:40.922
having to change something about ourselves,

45:40.924 --> 45:44.960
that it will always be
just an almost great thing,

45:44.962 --> 45:50.734
I think that says more than
either one of us ever could.

45:59.943 --> 46:03.246
I think there is
something more I could say.

46:05.248 --> 46:08.619
Ralph, I love you.

46:13.123 --> 46:14.925
Quinn, I think this has to end.

46:19.663 --> 46:21.932
Well, you're in early.

46:24.702 --> 46:27.803
So I guess you heard then.

46:27.805 --> 46:30.071
Heard what?

46:30.073 --> 46:32.908
Here, have some pancakes.

46:32.910 --> 46:35.711
Gladys called this morning.

46:35.713 --> 46:38.282
Chet died last night.

46:56.099 --> 46:59.234
Whoa! Ralph!

46:59.236 --> 47:02.904
This is your day off, you must have
some good stories about last night!

47:02.906 --> 47:05.776
No, God. Mort, what the hell?

47:08.145 --> 47:09.680
Okay, I'm sorry.

47:11.282 --> 47:13.584
I mean, what happened?

47:19.957 --> 47:22.791
When we got back after cruising last night,

47:22.793 --> 47:26.096
he took Gladys back to his
room, and... I don't know.

47:28.699 --> 47:31.400
I guess the excitement of
the night kind of got to him,

47:31.402 --> 47:35.304
but he couldn't get the
old rooster up so he...

47:35.306 --> 47:39.708
That wasn't like him, you
know? So he came to my room.

47:39.710 --> 47:43.180
He wanted to borrow a couple
of my, you know, blue pills?

47:44.882 --> 47:48.684
Hm... I don't know.

47:48.686 --> 47:51.389
I guess he had a heart condition
that none of us knew about.

47:54.292 --> 47:57.695
So... yeah.

48:02.966 --> 48:07.369
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah?

48:07.371 --> 48:09.838
What do you think happens
after? I mean, you know,

48:09.840 --> 48:13.742
- once rigor mortis sets in?
- Goddamn it, Mort.

48:13.744 --> 48:17.413
Come on. Come on, come on.

48:17.415 --> 48:20.048
Why is everything such a joke to you?

48:20.050 --> 48:23.151
It's not a joke, Ralph. It's life.

48:23.153 --> 48:27.289
Know what this is? This is my wife, okay?

48:27.291 --> 48:30.792
He's probably introducing
himself to her right now.

48:30.794 --> 48:36.199
Things go on, okay? Things go on. Okay?

48:39.002 --> 48:41.337
You gotta be happy. What
other choice you got?

48:41.339 --> 48:43.807
Your turn is comin', my turn is comin'.

48:45.276 --> 48:47.809
You don't think we need
just a little time to...

48:47.811 --> 48:50.779
- Some time to what?
- To remember him, to...

48:50.781 --> 48:53.349
I remember him while I'm laughing.

48:53.351 --> 48:55.817
I remember him while I'm happy.

48:55.819 --> 48:59.255
I remember her. Okay?

48:59.257 --> 49:01.425
Gotta have good times before we check out.

49:03.060 --> 49:05.261
'Cause we don't have
a choice when it comes.

50:12.863 --> 50:15.198
Let's get out of here.

51:42.520 --> 51:46.322
I don't know, I mean, how can one
person screw up so many good things?

51:46.324 --> 51:51.092
It's just like, sometimes I
don't even know what I don't know.

51:51.094 --> 51:52.596
You know?

52:34.572 --> 52:39.140
Oh, you might want to brew some
more, I just poured the last cup.

52:39.142 --> 52:41.610
Hey, they're all out of
everything, so I just...

52:41.612 --> 52:43.279
grabbed you a couple of onions.

52:43.281 --> 52:45.647
Yeah, perfect, I'm starving.

52:45.649 --> 52:48.183
Oh, I hope you guys aren't
picky about dishes or anything.

52:48.185 --> 52:50.652
I didn't know whose was whose,
so I just grabbed what I saw.

52:50.654 --> 52:53.289
Yeah, that's fine. Want
me to set you a place?

52:53.291 --> 52:56.124
Oh, no, I was just gonna shower
real quick, if that's all right.

52:56.126 --> 52:57.293
I have an appointment to get to.

52:57.295 --> 52:58.930
Okay.

53:10.308 --> 53:14.543
- What are you doing, Ralph?
- I don't know.

53:14.545 --> 53:17.114
I thought you two were finished.

53:19.350 --> 53:21.750
You just spent half the
drive up to the lake yesterday

53:21.752 --> 53:25.287
telling me how it would
never work between you two.

53:25.289 --> 53:29.192
- Maybe not talk about the lake.
- Ralph?

53:31.429 --> 53:36.131
- I don't what to say.
- Would you try?

53:36.133 --> 53:40.237
Us and the lake aside, what
are you even thinking with her?

53:42.105 --> 53:44.540
- Chet always said...
- Chet?

53:44.542 --> 53:48.143
I'm sorry, Ralph, Chet's dead.

53:48.145 --> 53:52.548
I know he was your friend, but
all he ever did was drag you down.

53:52.550 --> 53:56.184
- Quinn is good for me.
- How is she good for you?

53:56.186 --> 53:59.355
Name one thing she's
done that's good for you.

53:59.357 --> 54:04.159
- She makes me a better person.
- According to who?

54:04.161 --> 54:06.695
According to everybody.

54:06.697 --> 54:10.231
Jesus Christ, look at me.

54:10.233 --> 54:13.769
Look around us, what are we even doing?

54:13.771 --> 54:16.672
I have a chance, a good
chance, to quit being Ralph,

54:16.674 --> 54:20.709
the guy who won't figure it out.

54:20.711 --> 54:22.711
And I mean, it's fun,
but it's unsustainable.

54:22.713 --> 54:26.114
Eventually, I gotta
grow up and do something.

54:26.116 --> 54:29.351
You think that's how it has to be?

54:29.353 --> 54:33.789
- For you? For me?
- Everybody.

54:33.791 --> 54:38.594
What, you think we're something special,
like we know something nobody else does?

54:38.596 --> 54:41.463
Maggie, it's the other way around.

54:41.465 --> 54:47.569
And I'm tired of every time I go home
being the only one who doesn't count.

54:47.571 --> 54:51.239
I can't do it anymore.

54:51.241 --> 54:56.244
I can't keep sitting stagnant,
waiting for something to happen,

54:56.246 --> 55:00.217
especially if it already has
and I just can't even see it.

55:04.355 --> 55:07.323
I'm moving in with Quinn.

55:07.325 --> 55:11.094
She'll be back later today to help me pack.

55:12.796 --> 55:14.896
I grabbed an extra towel
out of the closet in there.

55:14.898 --> 55:17.801
- I hope that's okay.
- Yeah.

55:25.776 --> 55:28.877
There. That's a good use for it.

55:28.879 --> 55:32.414
Yeah. Looks good.

55:32.416 --> 55:35.317
Any idea what you want me
to do with all my vinyl?

55:35.319 --> 55:37.486
Um, I don't know.

55:37.488 --> 55:40.556
I'm not sure what we'll do
with your whole stereo system.

55:40.558 --> 55:42.724
Mine takes up enough space as it is.

55:42.726 --> 55:45.861
Maybe we can get all your
stuff transferred to digital?

55:45.863 --> 55:48.264
Yeah, we could do that.

55:48.266 --> 55:51.767
I guess for now let's just put
all your stuff in the closet.

55:51.769 --> 55:54.572
We might have to get you a storage unit.

55:56.440 --> 56:01.510
- I'm sort of surprised.
- Why's that?

56:01.512 --> 56:06.415
I don't know. All in all, that seemed pretty
painless, getting you moved out and in.

56:06.417 --> 56:09.518
Yeah, it was pretty good.

56:09.520 --> 56:13.724
I'm really excited you're
here. It's gonna be good.

56:15.626 --> 56:18.529
To your first official night.

56:29.373 --> 56:33.975
What about this one? "Bloggers wanted
for Search Engine Optimization."

56:33.977 --> 56:36.745
Click on it.

56:36.747 --> 56:39.581
"Now hiring writers to join one
of our teams of guest bloggers

56:39.583 --> 56:42.751
and niche article writers
for leading SEO company.

56:42.753 --> 56:48.590
Competitive pay, room to advance,
English majors preferred."

56:48.592 --> 56:51.527
God, it's like they
posted this just for you.

57:05.476 --> 57:07.609
- Beauvertonn?
- Yeah.

57:07.611 --> 57:09.745
Hm... my grandma hated it there.

57:09.747 --> 57:12.681
Picked up some bad habits from
some old stoner. Marty or somethin'.

57:16.287 --> 57:17.719
- Ralph?
- Yeah.

57:17.721 --> 57:19.255
- Hey, I'm Joe.
- Hey.

57:19.257 --> 57:20.591
Come on back.

57:22.260 --> 57:24.326
- So an English major, huh?
- Yeah.

57:24.328 --> 57:27.296
- And you've been published?
- Well, self-published.

57:27.298 --> 57:30.266
That's awesome, man. I
think you'll do well here.

57:30.268 --> 57:34.403
Welcome to the Thunderdome! Drink it in.

57:34.405 --> 57:36.872
- Nice.
- So, what do you know about SEO?

57:36.874 --> 57:40.809
- Uh, nothing.
- Good! 'Cause I was gonna say the first thing you have to do

57:40.811 --> 57:44.613
is forget everything you know about
SEO. So you already saved me a step.

57:44.615 --> 57:46.782
So essentially there
are several forms of SEO,

57:46.784 --> 57:49.385
but we mostly focus on
guest posting and blogging.

57:49.387 --> 57:52.721
The goal being to get our clients
ranked higher in the search engines.

57:52.723 --> 57:55.524
So what we do is reach out
to other high-ranking websites

57:55.526 --> 57:57.393
in the same field as our clients,

57:57.395 --> 57:59.561
posing as representatives of our clients,

57:59.563 --> 58:02.531
and offer to write articles
for those websites in exchange

58:02.533 --> 58:04.666
for links back to our clients' site.

58:04.668 --> 58:06.868
So you're pretty much a cyber ghost writer.

58:06.870 --> 58:10.339
And it's as easy as that. So I
got some videos for you to watch,

58:10.341 --> 58:13.074
- and I'll be back when you're done.
- Great.

58:13.076 --> 58:15.544
When I was 25,

58:15.546 --> 58:18.614
I wanted to make the Internet
a more interesting place.

58:18.616 --> 58:23.652
Provide content, reasons for
people to actually visit a website.

58:23.654 --> 58:25.521
Ghostblogging was the answer.

58:25.523 --> 58:28.457
Disappearing as a writer, using a fake name

58:28.459 --> 58:31.393
to generate content to
increase web traffic.

58:31.395 --> 58:34.830
So I began writing what they
call a mission statement.

58:34.832 --> 58:39.401
I realized then and there
that the key is volume.

58:39.403 --> 58:43.639
Less creativity, more output,
more clients, more traffic.

58:43.641 --> 58:48.043
I'll be the first to admit it, what
I was pitching seemed a bit sketchy.

58:48.045 --> 58:51.680
But I assure you, what we
are doing is completely legal.

58:51.682 --> 58:56.785
Writing how-to's, articles for culinary
sites not even knowing how to cook.

58:56.787 --> 58:59.455
But it doesn't matter,
neither does the reader.

58:59.457 --> 59:01.723
And that is the genius in it.

59:01.725 --> 59:04.393
As long as the words are
there and someone shows up

59:04.395 --> 59:06.862
to read them, our job is done.

59:06.864 --> 59:08.797
We are a writing machine.

59:08.799 --> 59:12.133
Generic is good, bland is better!

59:12.135 --> 59:16.473
Welcome to search engine optimization!

59:30.087 --> 59:33.422
So the first thing we need to do
is have you create your work persona

59:33.424 --> 59:35.123
you're gonna use with each client.

59:35.125 --> 59:36.992
We don't really want it to be your name,

59:36.994 --> 59:39.428
- kind of helps keep distance from everybody.
- Okay.

59:39.430 --> 59:43.599
Okay. So that's that, um,
here's your client list.

59:43.601 --> 59:47.769
Email me a couple of pitches, and I'll want
two articles for each by the end of the day.

59:47.771 --> 59:50.506
- Great.
- Cool.

01:00:25.175 --> 01:00:27.743
So this is "GladysAttic.com."

01:00:27.745 --> 01:00:31.447
Online consignment of retro home
furnishings and women's clothing.

01:00:31.449 --> 01:00:33.782
I emailed you on it. Think
you could take a look at it,

01:00:33.784 --> 01:00:37.619
get me a persona drafted to get off to
the client? Maybe a spec article or two?

01:00:37.621 --> 01:00:39.957
- Yeah. I'll get right on it.
- Sweet.

01:00:44.862 --> 01:00:46.862
- What?
- High five.

01:00:46.864 --> 01:00:48.997
Jellyfish!

01:00:48.999 --> 01:00:51.232
New client loved what
you put together for her.

01:00:51.234 --> 01:00:55.203
Said the persona was spot on, thought
the spec article was fantastic.

01:00:55.205 --> 01:00:58.173
Home run, buddy!

01:00:58.175 --> 01:01:01.510
- How do you like your new phone?
- I love it.

01:01:01.512 --> 01:01:03.779
It's gonna be a great way
to stay on top of things.

01:01:03.781 --> 01:01:06.915
That's what she said.

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:09.084
Could be a bad thing.

01:01:09.086 --> 01:01:12.488
Now you have to deal with
giving everyone your new number.

01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:16.594
Yeah, well, it's not like I had
that many people calling me anyway.

01:01:21.231 --> 01:01:23.632
- What do you think of those?
- I like them.

01:01:23.634 --> 01:01:26.101
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you're a good writer.

01:01:26.103 --> 01:01:28.604
I actually believe you know what
you're talking about in these.

01:01:28.606 --> 01:01:29.938
That's kind of the point.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.709
Only these ones for Gladys' Attic...

01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:36.878
sound a lot like Maggie for some reason.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.148
Yeah, I mean, write what
you know, you know that.

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:42.183
I guess.

01:01:42.185 --> 01:01:45.120
But these are, like, spot-on her.

01:01:45.122 --> 01:01:46.588
Kind of weird.

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:49.057
Maybe, but the client loves them,

01:01:49.059 --> 01:01:50.826
and they're super easy to get published.

01:01:50.828 --> 01:01:52.561
She messages me

01:01:52.563 --> 01:01:55.130
after each one goes up to thank me, so...

01:01:55.132 --> 01:01:58.233
- The client emails you?
- Yeah, I mean, like, my work persona.

01:01:58.235 --> 01:02:00.602
She doesn't actually know who I am.

01:02:00.604 --> 01:02:02.638
I don't know. Still seems kind of weird.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.707
Maybe. But, I mean, like,
in a place where I don't

01:02:05.709 --> 01:02:07.776
get any actual credit for the stuff I post,

01:02:07.778 --> 01:02:10.078
it's kind of nice to get
a little bit of validation.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.215
Well, I'm glad you're doing so well.

01:02:18.722 --> 01:02:21.158
- I like this shirt on you.
- Thanks.

01:02:23.627 --> 01:02:26.962
- How come you quit writing?
- What do you mean?

01:02:26.964 --> 01:02:32.334
I don't know, you told me once you used
to do poetry and stuff. Why did you stop?

01:02:32.336 --> 01:02:38.139
Um, I don't know. I guess I just
realized I was better at cooking.

01:02:38.141 --> 01:02:41.242
There's a market for it and not poetry.

01:02:41.244 --> 01:02:44.012
Just sort of made more sense.

01:02:44.014 --> 01:02:46.282
Do you still like to cook?

01:02:46.284 --> 01:02:50.852
Yeah, I mean, I don't enjoy doing
it for myself as much anymore,

01:02:50.854 --> 01:02:53.622
but that's kind of how it goes.

01:02:53.624 --> 01:02:55.691
Can't have it all.

01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:07.102
What are you doing here?

01:03:07.104 --> 01:03:11.039
I don't know. Just revisiting.

01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:13.842
You don't actually miss this, do you?

01:03:13.844 --> 01:03:15.944
After all the hassle I gave
you, I would have figured

01:03:15.946 --> 01:03:17.879
you'd be thrilled to move past this.

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:21.149
No, I am, I am. I don't know, it's just...

01:03:21.151 --> 01:03:24.119
You know, it's not what you think.

01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:27.389
The reason that we do what we do.

01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:29.124
I know you felt like you
had to prove something,

01:03:29.126 --> 01:03:32.828
exhibit some talent or
proof of understanding,

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:34.996
but that's really not
what any of this was about.

01:03:34.998 --> 01:03:38.400
I don't care about what
you know or think you know,

01:03:38.402 --> 01:03:42.638
where you've been, where you're
going or where you think you're going.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.807
It's about where you are,
what you know right now.

01:03:45.809 --> 01:03:48.176
I'm really okay with where you end up,

01:03:48.178 --> 01:03:54.250
as long as it's where you want to be and
you're putting everything you have into it.

01:03:54.252 --> 01:03:56.785
Listen.

01:03:56.787 --> 01:04:00.689
There's something I've
been meaning to tell you.

01:04:00.691 --> 01:04:02.192
I...

01:04:04.127 --> 01:04:06.895
Attention everyone!

01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:10.432
Link of the day today goes
to our good man Ralph White,

01:04:10.434 --> 01:04:12.968
writing for Gladys' Attic, high site value,

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:16.938
outstanding article, and three
in-body links. Way to go, buddy!

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:21.312
Go ahead and shoot that off to the client,
and get yourself a treat from the cooler!

01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:09.024
Looks like "Charles Pike"
has himself a true fan.

01:05:09.026 --> 01:05:12.027
Always good for client retention.

01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:16.231
And a cute one, too. I was always
expecting Gladys to be an old lady.

01:05:16.233 --> 01:05:19.236
Good job!

01:05:30.381 --> 01:05:34.250
We should probably start
getting ready to leave.

01:05:34.252 --> 01:05:37.319
- Do we have to?
- Of course we have to.

01:05:37.321 --> 01:05:39.888
We told everyone we would be there.

01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:43.759
As I recall, you told everyone we'd
be there. I wasn't even in the room.

01:05:43.761 --> 01:05:46.194
It is not open for discussion.

01:07:57.561 --> 01:08:02.364
I made this for myself, for moments,

01:08:02.366 --> 01:08:05.501
for times, when I needed more.

01:08:05.503 --> 01:08:07.469
When I had feelings of doubt.

01:08:07.471 --> 01:08:11.673
Keep being creative and pushing.

01:08:11.675 --> 01:08:14.075
Do what you love.

01:08:14.077 --> 01:08:17.313
And know that you are enough.

01:08:17.314 --> 01:08:20.017
Everybody needs that sometimes.

01:08:21.984 --> 01:08:25.687
- Hi!
- Ralph White! How are you?

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:28.657
Um... I'm okay. How are you?

01:08:28.658 --> 01:08:32.428
- I'm good.
- Really?

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:35.296
- What?
- Nothing.

01:08:35.299 --> 01:08:38.033
- What?
- I, uh...

01:08:38.035 --> 01:08:40.636
I heard you broke up with your fiancé.

01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:43.305
Oh. Yeah.

01:08:43.307 --> 01:08:47.309
I did, actually. I broke
up with him last week.

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:49.278
Just wasn't the one? What happened?

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:53.014
Um, I thought he was.

01:08:53.015 --> 01:08:58.587
I don't know. I guess sometimes we get these
ideas in our head about the things that we want.

01:08:58.589 --> 01:09:02.691
I mean, he had the job, he
had the plan, all of that.

01:09:02.693 --> 01:09:04.326
I don't know. He was just...

01:09:04.328 --> 01:09:07.962
he was like too satisfied, or something.

01:09:07.965 --> 01:09:10.566
There was no oomph, no
drive to do the unexpected.

01:09:10.568 --> 01:09:13.301
It was just like, "We're
here, yay, we made it.

01:09:13.304 --> 01:09:15.671
Now, let's get married, let's buy a house,

01:09:15.673 --> 01:09:17.506
let's have 2.3 kids and
a white picket fence."

01:09:17.508 --> 01:09:20.509
I know it sounds really
weird. But it just...

01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:24.582
I know, it kind of took all of the
surprise and mystery out of it or something.

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:29.318
So, what are you going to do?

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:32.554
Um, I don't know.

01:09:32.555 --> 01:09:34.457
That's a really good question.

01:09:37.728 --> 01:09:40.595
Okay, uh, bye, Ralph.

01:09:40.598 --> 01:09:43.634
- It's good to see you.
- Bye.

01:09:55.779 --> 01:09:59.381
- Hey, Ralph!
- Well, hey, Gladys.

01:09:59.383 --> 01:10:03.552
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just checking in.

01:10:03.554 --> 01:10:06.021
- Where is everybody?
- Movies.

01:10:06.023 --> 01:10:08.557
Oh, okay.

01:10:08.559 --> 01:10:11.460
Hey, uh, how's Maggie been doing?

01:10:11.462 --> 01:10:14.430
Oh, I haven't seen her in ages.

01:10:14.432 --> 01:10:16.131
She's not working here anymore?

01:10:16.133 --> 01:10:20.168
No. She left right after you.

01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:23.339
And she pops in every
now and again like you do.

01:10:23.341 --> 01:10:26.608
- Her business really took off.
- What business?

01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:29.378
Oh, she's selling stuff online.

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:32.247
She named her business after me, so sweet.

01:10:32.249 --> 01:10:34.149
And she's... she's doing fine.

01:10:34.151 --> 01:10:39.388
She was a bit shaky there
for a minute after you left.

01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:43.224
But, uh, she was giving all
her stuff away and saying

01:10:43.226 --> 01:10:46.762
she was going to move back east.

01:10:46.764 --> 01:10:51.500
You know, Ralph, Chet
really did a number on you.

01:10:51.502 --> 01:10:55.771
We both did, on both of you.

01:10:55.773 --> 01:10:57.105
How do you mean?

01:10:57.107 --> 01:11:01.710
Well, he talked about you a lot.

01:11:01.712 --> 01:11:04.446
He and I were on and
off again enough that...

01:11:04.448 --> 01:11:08.116
for me to know how he really felt.

01:11:08.118 --> 01:11:12.654
And, uh, that night he died,

01:11:12.656 --> 01:11:15.691
after we saw you and Quinn together,

01:11:15.693 --> 01:11:19.630
he told me that he felt he'd
really messed up on this one.

01:11:20.698 --> 01:11:22.130
Deep down inside,

01:11:22.132 --> 01:11:24.500
Chet was really jealous of you.

01:11:24.502 --> 01:11:27.336
Oh, I know he said you
goofed off all the time,

01:11:27.338 --> 01:11:31.542
but gosh, Ralph, you have it so good.

01:11:33.644 --> 01:11:39.415
Well, he's not here to
say he's sorry, but I am.

01:11:39.417 --> 01:11:42.286
And he's sorry, Ralph. We both are.

01:11:43.887 --> 01:11:47.090
And I hope you can still be happy in life.

01:11:55.232 --> 01:11:56.700
Ralph, you still up?

01:11:58.302 --> 01:12:00.235
You would not believe it.

01:12:00.237 --> 01:12:03.605
Today was the longest day ever.

01:12:03.607 --> 01:12:06.575
It was a complete disaster,

01:12:06.577 --> 01:12:11.248
and I am so glad it's over.

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.032
Yeah, I don't know, um...

01:14:44.034 --> 01:14:46.502
I dove into that water expecting
to find the love of my life,

01:14:46.504 --> 01:14:49.638
but when I came up, all
I saw was my roommate.

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.608
Guess I just sort of looked
like an idiot instead.

01:14:52.610 --> 01:14:55.043
Just sort of?

01:14:55.045 --> 01:14:57.946
I'm kidding, Ralph.

01:14:57.948 --> 01:15:00.015
Of course I wish it would
have been all for me.

01:15:00.017 --> 01:15:02.851
The big gesture. Boom box over your head.

01:15:02.853 --> 01:15:06.488
Jumping on the back of a lawn
mower, riding off into the sunset.

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:10.659
Yeah I don't know, Maggie, I think
we gave it the best shot we could.

01:15:10.661 --> 01:15:13.297
You know, I think we both
know it just can't work.

01:15:15.999 --> 01:15:17.735
It's good to see you, though.

01:15:18.836 --> 01:15:20.969
So, what are you going to do now?

01:15:20.971 --> 01:15:24.340
I don't know. Um...

01:15:24.342 --> 01:15:26.041
Maybe I'll write a book or something.

01:15:26.043 --> 01:15:28.311
Figure it out that way.

01:16:18.028 --> 01:16:20.396
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey!

01:16:20.398 --> 01:16:23.098
So this is the book, huh?

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.166
Glad to see that publisher
finally came through.

01:16:25.168 --> 01:16:27.436
Uh, no, actually this is a different one.

01:16:27.438 --> 01:16:30.105
Wow, two novels and you
haven't even struck 30.

01:16:30.107 --> 01:16:31.973
Very impressive.

01:16:31.975 --> 01:16:33.842
Well, two and a half.

01:16:33.844 --> 01:16:37.145
But there was one in between
that didn't really pan out.

01:16:37.147 --> 01:16:39.881
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. That's all right, though.

01:16:39.883 --> 01:16:42.050
I mean, it helped me
work through some stuff.

01:16:42.052 --> 01:16:46.455
And, uh, probably what led me to this one.

01:16:46.457 --> 01:16:52.093
"For Chet, who taught me
to play the hand I'm dealt."

01:16:52.095 --> 01:16:54.796
- Who's Chet?
- Just an old friend.

01:16:54.798 --> 01:16:59.703
- Oh. Well, will you sign mine?
- Yeah.

01:17:11.482 --> 01:17:14.082
"Lorane, enjoy the book.

01:17:14.084 --> 01:17:16.520
Ralph White."

01:17:18.456 --> 01:17:20.221
Hey, congratulations, Ralph.

01:17:20.223 --> 01:17:23.024
I'm really, really happy for you. Bye.

01:17:23.026 --> 01:17:25.961
- Uh...
- Yeah?

01:17:25.963 --> 01:17:32.200
- You want a candy cane?
- Oh. Um, thank you.

01:17:35.873 --> 01:17:38.940
- Well, merry Christmas, Ralph.
- Bye.

01:17:38.942 --> 01:17:40.978
Bye.

01:17:49.787 --> 01:17:51.121
Shit.

01:17:52.956 --> 01:17:55.125
Damn it!

01:18:08.238 --> 01:18:10.939
Shit.

01:18:10.941 --> 01:18:12.574
Not again.
