00:01.450 --> 00:03.450
Previously on Stargate Atlantis

00:05.490 --> 00:06.650
We saw the hive ship blow up.

00:06.689 --> 00:09.370
<i>I assure you Dr McKay that
Major Sheppard is alive and well.</i>

00:09.410 --> 00:10.330
Who is this?

00:10.370 --> 00:13.850
<i>Steven Caldwell. Commander of the Daedalus.</i>
We are ready to assist you.

00:14.450 --> 00:17.370
Rodney we need the shield up
in 40 seconds or we're dead!

00:18.850 --> 00:21.490
With only one functioning ZPM,
we can't expect to hold on that long.

00:21.530 --> 00:23.010
<i>Are we talking months, weeks?</i>

00:23.050 --> 00:23.770
Days.

00:23.810 --> 00:25.570
<i>- What if they thought we were gone?
- Destroy the city you mean?</i>

00:25.610 --> 00:27.050
No, we just make it look like we did.

00:27.090 --> 00:28.490
<i>We fake a self destruct.</i>

00:28.530 --> 00:29.730
Is it working or not?

00:29.850 --> 00:31.170
I think they bought it.

00:35.050 --> 00:36.250
He should be dead.

00:36.290 --> 00:39.210
- I'd like to report for duty ma'am.
- Dr. Beckett released you?

00:41.210 --> 00:41.850
Where's Ford.

00:41.890 --> 00:43.010
I assume that's him in the Jumper?

00:43.050 --> 00:45.570
- Shut it down!
- I can't the Jumper's in control!

00:46.530 --> 00:47.730
We'll find him.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.290
Maybe.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.050
Hey, what are you doing up so late?

01:15.650 --> 01:16.850
Couldn't sleep.

01:18.810 --> 01:21.690
Must be the burden of command.

01:21.850 --> 01:25.210
You know, ever since I was promoted to Lt Colonel.

01:26.970 --> 01:29.050
Alright John, it's been almost a month.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.570
When are you going to stop trying to find
a way to bring that up in every single conversation.

01:32.610 --> 01:33.850
You gotta understand.

01:33.930 --> 01:37.250
There's a lot of people in the Air Force
who never thought I'd make it past Captain.

01:37.850 --> 01:41.770
Well obviously, the people who's
opinions matter the most thought otherwise.

01:47.170 --> 01:49.370
What about you? What are you still doing up?

01:51.130 --> 01:53.610
I think I got used to fall asleep
to the sound of the ocean.

01:54.610 --> 01:57.530
Well McKay say's we're already
at the edge of the Pegasus Galaxy.

01:57.770 --> 02:00.250
You'll be fine once we get back to Atlantis.

02:01.810 --> 02:03.210
You know it's funny.

02:03.290 --> 02:07.730
I spent the past year wondering if I'd ever see
Earth again and as soon as I got there...

02:09.370 --> 02:11.009
I know how you feel.

02:11.130 --> 02:14.450
God, it was extremely convenient
to be able to step through the gate

02:14.490 --> 02:19.250
and be at Stargate Command in an instant
and now this feels extremely inconvenient.

02:19.290 --> 02:22.930
Having to spend 18 day's
cooped up in this ship to get back.

02:22.970 --> 02:27.130
Until we find another ZPM to power the Earth gate,
that's just the way it's gonna have to be.

02:27.250 --> 02:30.930
Dr Weir. Colonel Sheppard. There's been an accident.

02:40.530 --> 02:42.450
That's Doctor Monroe. What happened?

02:42.570 --> 02:44.170
I don't know.

02:45.250 --> 02:46.850
But he's dead.

03:55.390 --> 03:57.670
Right, one, two, three.

03:59.870 --> 04:01.070
Carry on.

04:03.070 --> 04:04.310
How did he die?

04:04.430 --> 04:07.670
I'm not 100% certain,
but there are burn marks on his fingertips.

04:09.470 --> 04:11.750
Obviously there was a short.

04:13.350 --> 04:14.990
Panels open, circuits are charred.

04:15.030 --> 04:17.630
There's not enough juice in those circuits
to kill anyone. Doctor?

04:17.750 --> 04:20.709
I'll know more once I've had a chance
to examine the body more thoroughly.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.070
Do you know what he was working on?

04:24.150 --> 04:27.550
Computer diagnostics. Strictly routine.
I've got security camera footage.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.190
What happened there?

04:44.230 --> 04:45.590
I don't know. It's a camera malfunction.

04:45.630 --> 04:48.830
Right before he was killed? Interesting coincidence.

04:48.990 --> 04:52.230
Actually, I think it makes sense.
Look, Colonel Caldwell is right.

04:52.270 --> 04:55.710
There's not enough juice in those circuits
to kill someone. At least not normally.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.070
What are you thinking?

04:57.110 --> 04:59.950
It's possible there was some sort of
isolated power surge in this section.

04:59.990 --> 05:01.910
That would explain the lost camera,
the malfunctioning door.

05:01.950 --> 05:07.750
So, when the door control didn't respond he took off
the panel to bypass the circuits and received a fatal jolt?

05:07.830 --> 05:09.110
Like I said, it's possible.

05:09.150 --> 05:12.390
Look, I recommend we drop out of hyperspace,
run a full diagnostic on the power distribution system.

05:12.430 --> 05:15.270
No. We drop out now, we risk being detected.

05:15.350 --> 05:16.710
That's true. I just think that if we were...

05:16.790 --> 05:20.150
We're back in Atlantis in less than two days.
You can do your diagnostic then.

05:20.910 --> 05:22.430
Colonel, are you sure that's wise?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.470
With all due respect Doctor,
you got back to Earth through the Stargate.

05:25.550 --> 05:27.430
This is my third trip on
the Daedalus, between galaxies.

05:27.510 --> 05:30.670
I understand that, but this ship is relatively new
and there might be some problems...

05:30.710 --> 05:34.350
Doctor! A word please.

05:41.630 --> 05:44.950
I know the chain of command can get a little fuzzy
on Atlantis, but that's not gonna happen here.

05:45.350 --> 05:47.550
You got a problem with my orders,
you take it to me in private.

05:47.630 --> 05:49.670
Otherwise keep your opinions to yourself.

05:49.870 --> 05:52.030
Are you sure that's what this is all about?

05:52.230 --> 05:53.910
I got a job to do, Doctor.

05:53.990 --> 05:55.550
But not the one you wanted.

06:00.270 --> 06:02.950
We understand the international community has approved

06:02.990 --> 06:07.350
a significant increase in personnel
and resources for the Atlantis mission.

06:07.470 --> 06:11.510
Now that we have a ZPM,
the city can support a much larger contingent.

06:11.830 --> 06:16.570
Of course, if there's a filling in a corresponding
increase in military presence would also be prudent.

06:16.670 --> 06:20.270
I agree. That's why I want
the Major Sheppard to come back with me.

06:20.350 --> 06:23.790
In fact I brought all my senior staff back.

06:23.870 --> 06:27.350
I think it's only fair that they participate
in the selection process

06:27.390 --> 06:29.950
of the new personnel in their respective departments.

06:30.270 --> 06:32.630
That's kind of what we wanted to talk to you about.

06:32.750 --> 06:36.910
In your report, you single Major Sheppard
out for a lot of credit.

06:37.150 --> 06:38.670
That's right.

06:38.790 --> 06:42.550
You were also candid enough
to document several occasions

06:42.590 --> 06:46.950
in which you and the Major
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

06:47.030 --> 06:50.790
In particular, there was an incident
involving an alien nano-virus,

06:50.870 --> 06:54.670
in which Major Sheppard directly
disobeyed one of your orders.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.590
He also saved a lot of lives that day.

07:00.350 --> 07:03.990
Well, the Major's courage and ingenuity
are not in question here.

07:04.110 --> 07:07.190
His ability to follow the proper chain of command, is!

07:07.270 --> 07:08.750
I'm not military General.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.590
But you are the leader of the expedition.

07:10.630 --> 07:15.310
You see Doctor, from our point of view, Major Sheppard's
independant nature causes a bit of a problem.

07:15.470 --> 07:23.870
If he can disobey you he may see fit to do the same to
the new Commander of the military contingent on Atlantis.

07:24.150 --> 07:27.750
Excuse me? And when did this happen?

07:27.830 --> 07:33.550
Of course the decision hasn't been made yet.
But we do have a candidate in mind.

07:40.630 --> 07:43.390
Atlantis HAS a military Commander.

07:43.470 --> 07:46.430
You had a military Commander. Colonel Sumner.

07:47.630 --> 07:52.390
When he was killed,
Major Sheppard correctly assumed the position,

07:52.750 --> 07:55.430
until a proper replacement could be brought in.

07:55.750 --> 08:00.430
Doctor, you can't be suggesting that a mission
of this importance be trusted to a Major.

08:00.630 --> 08:02.790
And one with a questionable record, at that.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.750
Major Sheppard's record before
he joined my team doesn't concern me.

08:07.030 --> 08:11.150
All I can tell you is that if it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

08:12.070 --> 08:13.550
<i>And as for his rank.</i>

08:14.630 --> 08:18.790
Well, if that's not good enough for you?
You're just gonna have to promote him.

08:19.230 --> 08:19.950
Doctor...

08:19.990 --> 08:21.950
I shouldn't have to remind you gentlemen,

08:22.350 --> 08:26.550
that I continue to have the support
of the President and our foreign allies.

08:27.710 --> 08:29.750
You don't wanna fight me on this one.

08:48.270 --> 08:49.070
Colonel Caldwell!

08:49.350 --> 08:50.350
What is it doctor?

08:50.390 --> 08:53.230
Look. I realise that you've already made it clearly that
you're not big on the whole dropping out of hyperspace.

08:53.310 --> 08:56.470
Which I understand, given that we're in the middle
of some uncharted section of the Pegasus Galaxy

08:56.550 --> 08:58.470
with who knows what waiting for us around the corner.

08:58.510 --> 08:59.550
Doctor?

08:59.630 --> 09:03.630
Look, I think it's possible that Dr Monroe's death
might not have been an accident.

09:03.870 --> 09:04.870
What are you talking about?

09:04.950 --> 09:07.990
I checked the power distribution logs against
the time code on the security camera.

09:08.070 --> 09:11.630
There was an unexplained spike, but it happened
thirty seconds after the camera went out.

09:11.710 --> 09:12.550
So?

09:12.710 --> 09:16.150
So that means the malfunction in the door and
the camera were not caused by the same problem.

09:16.270 --> 09:17.950
Major Sheppard was right.
There's too much of a coincidence.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.830
You mean, Lt.-Col. Sheppard.

09:20.070 --> 09:23.070
Right. That's gonna take some getting used to.

09:23.310 --> 09:24.950
Is that the only evidence you have?

09:25.030 --> 09:25.990
No, something else.

09:26.030 --> 09:29.750
It looks like Dr Monroe was in the process
of enabling certain computer security protocols.

09:29.790 --> 09:32.750
Designed to... isolate and
shut down corrupted programs.

09:32.830 --> 09:33.910
What programs?

09:33.990 --> 09:36.030
I don't know, that's just it.
He was killed before he could finish.

09:36.110 --> 09:39.310
You're telling me there's a problem with the ship
and someone killed Monroe to cover it up?

09:39.390 --> 09:43.510
I know this sounds crazy, but there is definitely
more going on here than random malfunctions.

09:45.350 --> 09:48.910
Bridge this is Caldwell.
Drop us out of hyperspace immediately.

10:05.630 --> 10:09.390
If I may be so bold. What exactly are we looking for?

10:09.470 --> 10:11.910
Any indication that someone's been
tampering with the ships computers.

10:12.670 --> 10:15.030
Perhaps you could be more specific.

10:15.150 --> 10:16.630
Not really, no.

10:18.550 --> 10:19.750
What was that?

10:20.110 --> 10:21.310
Nothing.

10:21.350 --> 10:24.350
Look, just check the major systems.
Propulsion, navigation, life support.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.230
Look for anything out of the ordinary.
Lindstrom and I will check power distribution,

10:27.270 --> 10:29.470
see if we can figure out what caused the power spike.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.750
- How's it going Rodney?
- It's going to take a while.

10:35.950 --> 10:37.830
Don't stare. He hates it when people stare.

10:37.910 --> 10:40.790
Am I the only one who thinks it's strange
we're working with an alien?

10:40.870 --> 10:45.130
Intergalactic hyperdrive technology
is kind of new to us, so we need his help.

10:45.390 --> 10:47.390
Is he supposed to be naked like that?

10:47.710 --> 10:49.190
Lindstrom!

11:03.030 --> 11:09.030
OK, let's speed this up. You take the logs
and I'm gonna take a look at... junction box!

11:23.270 --> 11:24.710
<i>I got nothing. You?</i>

11:24.910 --> 11:26.150
Give me a second.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.270
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

11:28.350 --> 11:29.150
What?

11:29.270 --> 11:30.790
I think I got something here.

11:31.070 --> 11:32.310
Well what?

11:35.830 --> 11:37.630
Coolant leak, we gotta get the hell out of here!

11:40.630 --> 11:41.630
Lindstrom!

11:44.990 --> 11:46.150
Lindstrom!

11:53.950 --> 11:55.150
Lindstrom!

11:55.630 --> 11:58.430
Lindstrom! You alright.

12:03.430 --> 12:06.270
Yeah, I'm OK. How am I gonna get out of here?

12:06.390 --> 12:09.870
I don't know. Just sit tight. We're gonna need
to shut down the leak and vent the room...

12:13.350 --> 12:14.150
Rodney!

12:14.710 --> 12:17.750
Lindstrom! Lindstrom you reading me?

12:19.150 --> 12:21.150
Lindstrom, are you reading me?

12:27.150 --> 12:28.750
What the hell are you doing?

12:31.750 --> 12:35.070
The airlock is opening! Override the system!

12:35.190 --> 12:36.390
Rodney help me!!

12:36.510 --> 12:37.390
Lindstrom!

12:38.550 --> 12:39.550
Rodney!

12:41.350 --> 12:42.150
Lindstrom!

12:49.950 --> 12:51.550
Oh my God.

13:05.770 --> 13:07.930
I already told you I'm fine.

13:07.950 --> 13:11.330
He's right. It appears he didn't inhale
enough toxins to cause any permanent damage.

13:11.340 --> 13:15.140
Although, a few more seconds of exposure,
it would have been quite a different story.

13:15.210 --> 13:16.350
Thank you Doctor.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.950
I assume this time we can definitely
rule out random malfunctions?

13:20.990 --> 13:24.030
Lindstrom found something new. He was trying
to tell me what it was when the leak happened.

13:24.150 --> 13:25.190
<i>What were you looking for?</i>

13:25.270 --> 13:28.390
We were trying to trace the source
of the power spike that killed Dr Monroe.

13:28.470 --> 13:29.630
Who else knew what you were doing?

13:29.670 --> 13:31.230
A lot of people knew that we were running diagnostics,

13:31.310 --> 13:33.790
but no-one knew that we were
in that particular room at that exact moment.

13:34.270 --> 13:41.230
Security camera's. If the person who killed Monroe was
able to get into the system to erase evidence,

13:41.310 --> 13:44.630
there's no reason he couldn't do the same thing
to keep tabs on the investigation.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.950
Assuming it's a he.

13:47.310 --> 13:49.910
How many personnel onboard have
the technical skills to do something like this?

13:49.990 --> 13:53.350
Everybody. That's what you get for
assembling a team of brilliant scientists.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.670
I can't believe it would be one of our own people.

13:55.790 --> 13:57.790
Isn't it possible there's an intruder onboard?

13:57.870 --> 14:01.630
We used the lifesigns detector
to do a head count. We didn't get any extra signals.

14:02.350 --> 14:04.750
Well a hibernating Wraith? They can avoid detection.

14:04.870 --> 14:09.550
We've seen that tactic before. Beam in, lay low,
then look for the chance to conduct sabotage.

14:09.670 --> 14:13.190
That was on Atlantis. It's been at least
two months since this ship encountered a Wraith.

14:13.230 --> 14:15.390
There's no way one of them could have
stowed onboard for that long.

14:15.470 --> 14:18.950
He's right. They did a full decontamination sweep
back on Earth. They would have found something.

14:20.510 --> 14:24.910
Alright then. As of this moment I want
all civilian personnel confined to their quarters.

14:25.270 --> 14:26.070
What?

14:26.190 --> 14:28.150
Present company excepted of course.

14:28.190 --> 14:31.630
Colonel, with all due respect, some of those people
could be extremely helpful in the investigation.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.950
I'm sorry Doctor, but I can't trust any of them

14:33.990 --> 14:36.350
for the simple reason that
I didn't have any say in their selections.

14:36.390 --> 14:38.550
Somebody else was in charge of that process.

14:42.870 --> 14:46.670
Look at this. Four years relief
work in the Sudan and Ethiopia.

14:46.710 --> 14:49.550
Graduate studies at John Hopkins and Harvard.

14:49.630 --> 14:51.390
Half a dozen research grants.

14:51.470 --> 14:55.910
And she also enjoys judo, horseback riding,
origami and something called base jumping.

14:56.070 --> 14:58.670
Parachuting from cliffs and tall buildings.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.070
Oh! Of course.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.470
You said you wanted the best.

15:01.550 --> 15:04.470
All of these people are more qualified than I am.
How am I supposed to choose between them?

15:04.630 --> 15:08.190
Carson, you're my Chief Surgeon.
No-one is more qualified than you.

15:11.070 --> 15:15.870
Well, I've managed to make a short list.

15:16.230 --> 15:18.590
I was hoping you'd make the final selections.

15:20.190 --> 15:21.710
This is your short list?

15:25.590 --> 15:27.990
Did you review the file of a Dr Simon Wallis?

15:28.110 --> 15:30.710
Aye. He was also more qualified than I am.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.350
Why isn't he on the list?

15:32.830 --> 15:35.750
Well, the candidates were required to sign on
for a blank commitment to a one-year term.

15:37.870 --> 15:41.310
Doctor Wallis has been given security clearance.
He knows what this is all about.

15:42.070 --> 15:43.510
Maybe that's the problem.

15:44.510 --> 15:45.710
What do you mean?

15:46.110 --> 15:47.270
He hasn't signed.

15:54.590 --> 15:56.110
When were you gonna tell me?

15:56.950 --> 16:00.590
There's nothing to tell. I mean,
I haven't said yes, but I haven't said no either.

16:01.230 --> 16:05.750
You do realise you are not gonna make
the final list of candidates unless you commit!

16:05.870 --> 16:10.150
Elizabeth, you know you can't just come back after a year
and expect me to drop everything on two weeks notice.

16:10.190 --> 16:12.470
I have responsabilities here,
I have patients, I have a surge.

16:12.590 --> 16:16.510
I know, I know, and I would never
diminish the importance of you work.

16:16.550 --> 16:19.390
But you have to understand that every single person

16:19.590 --> 16:21.990
on this entire expedition
is in the exact same situation.

16:22.070 --> 16:24.430
I mean, In fact it's why they were
chosen in the first place.

16:24.470 --> 16:25.550
I understand.

16:25.990 --> 16:28.790
Look, I just need a little more time.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.230
Doctor McKay. You are just in time.

16:44.390 --> 16:46.430
For what? What are you looking at?

16:46.830 --> 16:48.710
The sabotage we've been searching for.

16:49.830 --> 16:51.110
It's a virus.

16:51.150 --> 16:52.710
How perceptive of you.

16:53.110 --> 16:54.390
Where did you find it?

16:54.590 --> 16:56.790
One of the navigational computers.

16:56.830 --> 17:01.470
There is evidence of it in communications
and some of the propulsion systems as well.

17:01.590 --> 17:02.470
So it's spreading.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.990
- Yes, and changing.
- What do you mean?

17:05.150 --> 17:07.710
It appears to be rewriting itself as it grows.

17:08.230 --> 17:11.990
It is unlike any human-engineered
programme I have ever encountered.

17:14.230 --> 17:16.630
Air person, move to there.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.069
What are you doing?

17:19.270 --> 17:21.829
I'm just checking something, I'm sure it is impossible.

17:26.869 --> 17:28.430
Crap.

17:28.710 --> 17:29.870
What did you do?

17:30.910 --> 17:33.110
I just ran it through a translation programme.

17:34.070 --> 17:35.270
It's Wraith.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.750
'Crap' indeed.

17:42.950 --> 17:44.710
A Wraith computer virus.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.870
It was probably downloaded
during our last little encounter.

17:46.880 --> 17:49.900
Well, if it's been there all this time,
why are we just noticing it now?

17:50.230 --> 17:52.310
Well, in all likelihood it was
transmitted in a compressed format.

17:52.430 --> 17:56.470
It took a while to unfold, to spread
to the point where it could affect our systems.

17:56.750 --> 17:59.070
I think it probably happened
during the return flight to Earth.

17:59.110 --> 18:01.390
Since then, it's been dormant,
waiting for some kind of a trigger.

18:01.510 --> 18:02.590
Like what?

18:02.990 --> 18:06.510
Possibly the fact that we're once again
in proximity to Wraith territory?

18:06.870 --> 18:09.630
I think it was ultimately designed to
take control of the navigational system,

18:09.830 --> 18:11.830
fly the ship right to them.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.510
If they get their hands on the Daedalus,

18:14.910 --> 18:17.910
they'll not only have access to
the intergalactic hyperdrive technology

18:17.950 --> 18:20.430
but they'll have all the navigation
data that'll lead them straight to Earth.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.860
That's what they wanted all along.
A new feeding ground.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.310
That still doesn't explain who killed
Dr. Monroe and Dr. Lindstrom.

18:26.350 --> 18:28.350
That's what I'm trying to tell you. It was the virus.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.270
Look, it's an A.I., an artificial intelligence.
It can think for itself,

18:33.390 --> 18:35.630
- adapt itself to new situations...
- Protect itself.

18:35.750 --> 18:36.510
<i>Exactly.</i>

18:36.790 --> 18:39.870
It knew that Lindstrom and Monroe
were gonna expose it, so it got rid of them.

18:40.230 --> 18:41.310
Can it take over the whole ship?

18:41.470 --> 18:45.510
Not entirely. You have to remember that
there are hundreds of individual computers on board.

18:45.550 --> 18:49.330
A lot of them are interconnected so we tend to think
of them as one big machine but that's not really the case.

18:49.350 --> 18:54.630
There are dozens of back-ups and redundancies, and some
systems like life support are deliberately isolated.

18:54.710 --> 18:57.070
So they can't kill us all by venting the atmosphere?

18:57.470 --> 18:58.710
That was the good news.

18:58.870 --> 19:00.750
The bad news is some of the more complex systems

19:00.870 --> 19:04.830
like navigation and propulsion require a certain
amount of interconnectivity to function properly.

19:05.390 --> 19:07.950
<i>In all likelihood, the virus has spread
so far through those systems</i>

19:07.990 --> 19:10.590
that to isolate it
will make the ship impossible to fly.

19:11.790 --> 19:14.110
Until we figure out how to get rid of it,
we're stuck here.

19:15.470 --> 19:18.310
Colonel Caldwell. Sir, we just
began broadcasting a distress call.

19:18.470 --> 19:19.310
What are you talking about?

19:19.430 --> 19:21.150
It just came on by itself, sir.

19:21.230 --> 19:22.430
Shut it down!

19:26.950 --> 19:28.510
I'm locked out, sir.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.790
It's the virus. That's what I mean
about adapting itself to new situations.

19:32.110 --> 19:36.270
It doesn't have enough control yet to fly us to
the Wraith so instead it's calling the Wraith to us.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.790
And right now, we are sitting ducks.

19:53.730 --> 19:54.850
What are you doing?

19:54.970 --> 19:57.410
Theoretically we should be able to
cut power to the long-range transmitter.

19:57.450 --> 19:59.890
You won't be able to send messages,
but neither will the virus.

20:00.050 --> 20:00.970
Theoretically.

20:01.010 --> 20:04.650
Well, it's pretty smart. So far,
whatever we've tried, it's been one step ahead of us.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.050
Try it now.

20:09.110 --> 20:11.710
It's no good, sir. We're still broadcasting.

20:12.070 --> 20:14.030
Alright, that leaves us one choice.

20:14.190 --> 20:16.070
<i>We need to do a full system shutdown.</i>

20:16.230 --> 20:18.550
We'll wipe everything, reboot, load clean back-ups.

20:18.790 --> 20:19.990
Will that really work?

20:20.270 --> 20:21.270
Absolutely...

20:21.670 --> 20:22.590
I think.

20:22.630 --> 20:23.830
How long will it take?

20:24.030 --> 20:26.070
Well it's not like the ship's got an on/off button.

20:26.110 --> 20:28.110
We need some time to prepare say, an hour, maybe two?

20:28.470 --> 20:31.070
Every minute we wait,
we increase our chances of being detected.

20:31.270 --> 20:33.190
We need to shut off the transmitter array now.

20:33.270 --> 20:34.310
Do you have an idea?

20:34.950 --> 20:36.350
As a matter of fact, I do.

20:37.390 --> 20:38.930
But you're not gonna like it.

20:45.830 --> 20:50.510
<i>Alright, Colonel, we've evacuated all sections
in the vicinity of the array and sealed the bulkheads.</i>

20:50.710 --> 20:51.590
Understood.

20:52.510 --> 20:54.430
All personnel, prepare for impact...

21:08.110 --> 21:09.350
What's our status?

21:10.670 --> 21:13.990
Transmitter is offline.
Distress signal has been disabled.

21:14.350 --> 21:15.870
Well done, Colonel, return to the ship.

21:16.310 --> 21:17.870
With pleasure.

21:26.470 --> 21:28.270
Uh, here's a problem.

21:29.110 --> 21:30.590
<i>My controls aren't responding.</i>

21:31.150 --> 21:32.190
Say again?

21:33.030 --> 21:35.030
<i>The Daedalus is behind me.</i>

21:35.350 --> 21:37.430
I can't seem to turn around and ...

21:38.070 --> 21:40.150
I am however picking up speed.

21:45.150 --> 21:46.230
I should have seen this coming!

21:46.750 --> 21:50.310
The navigational software in the F-302 is compatible
with our sublight system which would be infected.

21:50.430 --> 21:52.270
The virus must have uploaded itself onto the ship.

21:52.670 --> 21:54.230
What about the transport beam?

21:54.430 --> 21:56.150
That'll work. Those systems are still clean.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.230
Do it.

22:00.510 --> 22:02.390
John? This is Elizabeth.

22:02.870 --> 22:05.470
<i>Rodney seems to think
the virus has taken over your ship,</i>

22:05.510 --> 22:06.910
<i>so we're gonna try and beam you out.</i>

22:07.510 --> 22:09.190
Acknowledged.

22:09.430 --> 22:10.630
Standby.

22:15.350 --> 22:16.670
Ah, slight problem.

22:16.830 --> 22:17.550
What?

22:17.950 --> 22:21.950
The transport beam is tied to an Asgard sensor.
It's what we use to lock onto targets.

22:21.990 --> 22:22.710
So?

22:22.910 --> 22:26.630
So that particular piece of equipment was
located in the array that we just destroyed.

22:30.150 --> 22:32.230
I could key the system to lock onto his radio signal.

22:32.470 --> 22:34.590
It's what they used to do on the Prometheus
before they had Asgard sensors.

22:34.790 --> 22:37.870
You'd better do it quick, because in about
three minutes he's gonna be out of range.

22:39.030 --> 22:41.190
<i>John, we've run into a slight snag.</i>

22:41.350 --> 22:44.110
<i>Rodney just has to make a few adjustments
before we can get you out of there.</i>

22:45.550 --> 22:46.710
OK.

22:46.750 --> 22:49.270
Don't worry. I'm not about to give up on you just yet.

22:58.990 --> 23:00.950
Here you go.

23:01.390 --> 23:02.430
Thanks.

23:03.590 --> 23:06.110
I appreciate you coming here in person, Colonel.

23:06.590 --> 23:11.470
Aiden and I were only cousins, but since he didn't
have any brothers or sisters, we became very close.

23:12.190 --> 23:15.270
I want you to understand.
As far as I'm concerned he's still alive.

23:16.390 --> 23:19.790
Till I see evidence to the contrary,
I intend to keep looking for him.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.470
But you can't give me any details.

23:22.710 --> 23:25.670
You can't tell me where he was stationed
or how he went missing

23:25.950 --> 23:28.150
or what the chances are that I'll ever see him again.

23:28.590 --> 23:29.870
I'm sorry.

23:30.550 --> 23:33.750
This is exactly why I didn't want
you to speak with Aiden's grandparents.

23:34.230 --> 23:35.990
They can't take this kind of thing right now.

23:36.590 --> 23:40.750
I'm starting to think that maybe I should just
tell them that he's not coming home.

23:41.230 --> 23:44.710
- At least then they would have some closure.
- You know, we're not there yet.

23:46.230 --> 23:49.510
You know, Aiden mentioned
you in that taped message he sent.

23:49.830 --> 23:51.390
He said you were a good man.

23:52.190 --> 23:54.270
That he trusted you with his life.

23:55.030 --> 23:56.550
You tell me, Colonel.

23:57.190 --> 23:59.270
Was that trust misplaced?

24:00.710 --> 24:01.990
- Colonel?
<i>- Colonel?</i>

24:03.790 --> 24:04.590
Colonel!

24:06.510 --> 24:07.790
<i>John, are you still there?</i>

24:08.110 --> 24:08.990
Go ahead.

24:09.390 --> 24:13.550
<i>We're gonna use your radio to target the transport beam.
We'll have you out of there in just a minute.</i>

24:14.230 --> 24:16.030
Sounds good. So I'm still in range, right?

24:17.350 --> 24:19.510
The truth is, it's never
been tested from this distance.

24:20.670 --> 24:22.910
Rodney seems to think you'll be okay.

24:23.390 --> 24:24.670
Well that's good.

24:25.150 --> 24:27.230
I don't wanna leave any parts behind.

24:27.950 --> 24:30.150
We're ready. I'm beaming him directly to the bridge.

24:51.710 --> 24:53.190
Are you alright?

24:54.510 --> 24:58.470
Two arms, ten fingers.
I'll check the rest later.

25:00.870 --> 25:03.950
Alright Doctor, I've had enough of this.
I'd like to have my ship back please.

25:03.960 --> 25:04.800
Right.

25:16.710 --> 25:17.910
Do you mind?

25:18.630 --> 25:22.710
This is what I do when I have problems with my laptop.
I turn it off and then I turn it on again.

25:22.790 --> 25:24.830
I think this is a little bit
more complicated than that.

25:24.950 --> 25:28.510
I'm just saying, that if we're taking a page
from the John Sheppard book of computer repair,

25:28.550 --> 25:29.990
we're really desperate.

25:30.270 --> 25:32.710
Alright, Colonel! We're ready.

25:32.990 --> 25:33.950
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:34.110 --> 25:37.270
<i>All personnel, this is Colonel Caldwell.
Prepare for a full system shutdown.</i>

25:40.950 --> 25:42.630
Alright Doctor. Go ahead.

25:42.640 --> 25:43.640
And...

26:02.670 --> 26:04.710
What's all this?

26:07.670 --> 26:11.430
Well I figured we won't have
many more chances for a really good dinner.

26:11.630 --> 26:15.430
I mean, the food on Atlantis, it's alright,
and some of the Athosian dishes are fantastic, but...

26:15.550 --> 26:16.710
Elizabeth.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.270
I'm not going.

26:25.070 --> 26:26.350
I don't understand.

26:27.710 --> 26:30.550
- You're the adventurer, not me.
- But I'm not.

26:30.910 --> 26:33.310
I mean at least I wasn't, not before.

26:33.550 --> 26:37.270
Look, the first time I stepped
through that gate I was terrified.

26:37.710 --> 26:39.990
I knew I wasn't prepared for what I was getting into,

26:41.070 --> 26:43.070
- but I took a chance.
- I know.

26:43.790 --> 26:45.270
And I'm proud of you for that.

26:45.710 --> 26:47.630
- Simon, we...
- There's something else.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.790
I met someone.

27:09.470 --> 27:11.390
You were gone for a long time, Elizabeth.

27:40.630 --> 27:42.190
Engine room, what's our status?

27:42.230 --> 27:45.150
All systems are functioning normally.
No sign of the virus.

27:46.110 --> 27:47.750
Look's like it worked, Colonel.

27:48.430 --> 27:50.710
May I suggest we vacate this system?

27:51.070 --> 27:53.550
Our current position may well have been compromised.

27:53.870 --> 27:54.830
Can you give me hyperdrive?

27:55.070 --> 27:57.150
That will take longer to get back online.

27:57.310 --> 27:59.150
I can get you sublight!

27:59.710 --> 28:01.470
- Get us out of here, Major.
- Yes, sir.

28:13.710 --> 28:14.790
What is it?

28:14.830 --> 28:16.070
We're veering offcourse.

28:16.470 --> 28:18.270
Navigational controls are not responding.

28:20.790 --> 28:21.790
Damn it!

28:22.390 --> 28:23.430
<i>Engine room, what's happening?</i>

28:23.630 --> 28:26.950
The virus, it's back!
Now it's got full control of sublight navigation.

28:26.990 --> 28:28.270
You said all systems were clean.

28:28.310 --> 28:31.990
They were. When we did the reboot there was no sign
of the virus. This shouldn't be happening.

28:33.950 --> 28:37.510
Sir, we've got another problem. It's our new heading.

28:38.670 --> 28:40.550
We're on a collision course with the nearest star.

28:47.270 --> 28:51.390
The virus returned almost immediately
after we restarted the system.

28:53.150 --> 28:56.050
At the risk of repeating myself,
I thought we said we wiped it out.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.260
We did. I must have missed something.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.100
And it's gonna crash us into a sun?

28:59.370 --> 29:00.890
Not exactly.

29:01.250 --> 29:09.550
A more precise calculation of our heading show's
that we will not collide with the star, but rather,
make a close approach near it's coronasphere.

29:09.590 --> 29:14.550
The ship will survive,
but the radiation will kill everyone onboard.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.850
Why kill everyone if they already
have full navigational control?

29:17.890 --> 29:21.290
The virus has access to our database.
It knows our tactics, our tendencies...

29:21.330 --> 29:24.250
They know we'll destroy the ship
before we'll let it fall into Wraith hands.

29:25.650 --> 29:26.850
Wait a minute!

29:27.850 --> 29:31.130
There was a situation similar to this back at
Stargate Command. I remember reading the report.

29:31.450 --> 29:37.890
An alien entity took control of the base computer,
so they did a systems shutdown to destroy it.
It survived by uploading itself onto a MALP.

29:37.930 --> 29:39.570
OK, we don't have any MALP's.

29:39.580 --> 29:41.700
No, we've got a bay full of F-302's.

29:42.050 --> 29:45.050
We already know that the virus can upload itself
onto the ships navigational computers.

29:45.060 --> 29:48.540
But it could use any one of those ships as a hiding
place while we wiped the Daedalus systems clean.

29:48.570 --> 29:49.930
It's the only possible explanation.

29:50.130 --> 29:50.930
So?

29:51.010 --> 29:56.890
So, we physically pull the memory storage modules
from the 302's, we do another shutdown.
That should do the trick.

29:57.650 --> 30:01.010
Contact the bridge.
Tell Caldwell we're on the way to the bay now.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.650
It's not working.

30:20.250 --> 30:21.650
Let's try another way.

30:30.050 --> 30:32.570
It's the virus.
It must know what we're trying to do.

30:32.610 --> 30:33.450
How's that possible?

30:33.490 --> 30:35.850
It's thinking ahead, anticipating
our move, like in a chess match.

30:35.890 --> 30:37.170
I hope you're good at chess.

30:37.180 --> 30:40.140
I don't get to play much.
It's tough finding challenging opponents.

30:43.650 --> 30:44.850
Bridge, this is Sheppard!

30:44.860 --> 30:47.500
<i>Are there any open paths to the 302 bay?</i>

30:47.970 --> 30:53.250
That's a negative Colonel. Look's like
the entire section's been sealed off. We're trying
to override it but we're not having any luck.

30:53.290 --> 30:54.570
<i>You're gonna have to beam us in.</i>

30:55.050 --> 30:55.610
Wait a minute!

30:55.620 --> 31:01.180
The transport beam wasn't designed to beam
from one point to another point inside the ship.
We could end up rematerializing half inside a wall.

31:03.450 --> 31:05.090
We're just gonna have to take that chance.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.210
Right. Of course. Why not.

31:16.050 --> 31:18.770
Colonel, we're ready.

31:18.810 --> 31:22.130
<i>Standby.
Hermiod says we need to make a few adjustments first.</i>

31:26.650 --> 31:28.330
<i>Activating transport beam now!</i>

31:37.250 --> 31:38.290
It worked!

31:44.570 --> 31:45.570
Oh boy!

31:50.450 --> 31:51.810
Sir, the bay doors are opening!

31:51.815 --> 31:53.455
Bridge to engine room! Beam them out now!

31:55.650 --> 31:57.570
We should really, really be dead right now.

31:57.575 --> 31:58.815
I don't feel dead.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.890
Colonel Sheppard. Doctor McKay. Can you hear me?

32:01.895 --> 32:03.255
<i>Yeah we're reading you.</i>

32:03.370 --> 32:08.930
<i>I have raised the fighter bay shield in order
to prevent the atmosphere from escaping. However,</i>

32:08.935 --> 32:10.535
the virus has invaded the system

32:10.535 --> 32:14.135
<i>and it is only a matter of
time before it gains control.</i>

32:14.450 --> 32:19.010
<i>Therefore, I suggest you complete
your task as quickly as possible.</i>

32:42.850 --> 32:44.450
<i>Colonel Sheppard, how's it coming?</i>

32:44.490 --> 32:45.870
We're getting there!

32:50.010 --> 32:54.450
I can no longer prevent the virus
from gaining complete control of the shield.

32:54.650 --> 32:55.650
Beam them out.

32:55.690 --> 33:00.250
Unfortunately, it appears that I have
lost control of that system as well.

33:00.290 --> 33:01.930
<i>Sir, the shield is down.</i>

33:01.970 --> 33:03.090
The cargo bay is decompressing.

33:03.130 --> 33:04.490
Colonel Sheppard, come in!

33:07.350 --> 33:08.790
<i>Colonel Sheppard, do you read me?</i>

33:13.670 --> 33:15.190
<i>Colonel Sheppard, do you read?</i>

33:15.350 --> 33:17.950
This is Sheppard. We're OK.

33:17.990 --> 33:21.350
<i>We managed to get in
the last F-302 before we lost atmosphere.</i>

33:22.750 --> 33:24.710
Any chance you could beam us out?

33:24.870 --> 33:26.870
Sorry John, we lost the transport beam.

33:26.910 --> 33:28.590
<i>You're gonna have to sit still for a while.</i>

33:28.670 --> 33:31.550
We pulled all the memory units.
Another shutdown should work.

33:31.790 --> 33:32.830
<i>Understood.</i>

33:33.190 --> 33:33.790
Sir!

33:33.910 --> 33:37.870
Understood. Engine room, this is bridge.
We don't have a lot of time before
we approach lethal radiation levels.

33:37.910 --> 33:44.150
Most of the shutdown protocol's are still in place from
our first attempt. This will only take a few minutes.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.550
Let's hope we have a few minutes.

33:46.390 --> 33:52.710
You know, I've never actually been inside one
of these before today. It's a little, cramped, huh?

33:52.750 --> 33:56.550
Just relax Rodney. We're safe for the moment.

33:56.590 --> 34:04.230
Right. Quick question though, just out of curiosity.
How much... air, do these things carry?

34:04.270 --> 34:05.110
Lots.

34:05.150 --> 34:11.230
I'm just saying, because if this doesn't work and
we have to go off to another planet, who knows how long
we could get stuck in here and so it would...

34:11.270 --> 34:16.630
You know what Rodney?
You're exactly right. It's a limited supply,
so why don't we conserve it, by you not talking?

34:17.070 --> 34:17.870
At all!

34:21.750 --> 34:24.310
All hands, this is Colonel Caldwell.
We're gonna give this another shot!

34:24.315 --> 34:27.034
<i>We're initiating total systems shutdown now.</i>

34:39.750 --> 34:41.110
Reinitialising.

34:47.810 --> 34:48.610
Did it work?

34:48.650 --> 34:50.929
We will know momentarily.

34:51.850 --> 34:53.449
This is Sheppard. What just happened?

34:53.455 --> 34:55.074
Standby. We're trying to figure that out.

34:55.150 --> 34:58.550
I'm sorry sir.
We had navigation controls for a second,
but we just lost them again.

35:06.150 --> 35:09.270
It didn't work.
We're still on course for the coronasphere.

35:12.350 --> 35:15.470
This thing is like a damn cockroach.
You just can't kill it!

35:15.475 --> 35:18.515
This should have worked!
We've disabled every navigational computer in this bay.

35:18.540 --> 35:20.500
There's nowhere else on this ship, the virus can hide.

35:20.540 --> 35:25.220
You're right.
There's nowhere on the ship for it to hide,
but we didn't get every computer.

35:26.380 --> 35:27.340
What are you talking about?

35:27.380 --> 35:28.140
We missed one.

35:45.750 --> 35:46.670
What are you doing?

35:47.210 --> 35:50.850
It's the last F-302 Rodney.
The one we left behind? It's tracking us.

35:51.170 --> 35:54.290
That makes sense, but we can't go after it.
We need help from computers or navigation.

35:54.290 --> 35:57.690
I don't need the navigational computer
to fly this thing, besides we're not going far.

35:59.450 --> 36:04.250
<i>Engine room, this is Sheppard.
Prepare to initiate another shutdown on my command!</i>

36:04.290 --> 36:05.490
John? What are you doing?

36:05.530 --> 36:08.010
Getting to the last place the virus can hide.

36:08.050 --> 36:09.650
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm nearly done!

36:12.850 --> 36:16.250
<i>You'd better make this quick,
Sheppard. Radiation levels are beginning
to rise in the outer hull.</i>

36:16.370 --> 36:17.330
<i>Understood.</i>

36:29.450 --> 36:30.250
What is that beeping?

36:31.450 --> 36:34.450
Something just locked onto us.
Hold on!

36:48.850 --> 36:51.730
What happened to intertial dampers?

36:51.770 --> 36:54.450
At these speeds you're gonna feel
the tight turns even with the dampers.

36:54.570 --> 36:55.730
Now he tells me.

37:07.650 --> 37:14.210
I have them on my screens.
The computer controlled ship is preparing to fire.

37:15.050 --> 37:16.730
We're just gonna tap on the brakes here.

37:27.170 --> 37:27.930
Nice move.

37:28.250 --> 37:29.250
Indeed.

37:29.450 --> 37:31.410
He's making a break for the coronasphere.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.050
Did I mention that we have even less protection
in this ship than we did in the Daedalus?

37:34.055 --> 37:34.855
Not really.

37:35.010 --> 37:36.250
I didn't think so.

37:40.770 --> 37:43.850
Radiation levels in the Colonel's ship
are beginning to rise.

37:44.450 --> 37:47.090
Is it just me?
Or is it getting a little hotter in here?

37:47.095 --> 37:48.855
Hold on. I almost got him.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.050
What happened?

37:56.450 --> 38:00.490
They're approaching the coronasphere.
There is too much interference.

38:02.650 --> 38:06.210
You see the thing is, I have very fair skin.
I tend to burn very easy.

38:06.250 --> 38:08.410
Just a few more seconds.

38:25.450 --> 38:27.450
How long can they survive those radiation levels?

38:27.455 --> 38:30.255
I believe it has already been too long.

38:33.050 --> 38:34.250
John can you read me?

38:36.650 --> 38:37.810
<i>Rodney, come in.</i>

38:38.650 --> 38:44.810
<i>Daedalus this is Sheppard. Target is destroyed.
I repeat. Target is destroyed. If you try
one more shutdown, I think it might just work.</i>

38:46.850 --> 38:50.810
<i>Well done both of you.
You had us a little worried there for a minute.</i>

38:51.450 --> 38:52.610
Sorry about that.

38:53.450 --> 38:54.490
<i>This is Caldwell.</i>

38:54.530 --> 38:57.730
We'll rendez-vous as soon as we've eradicated
the virus once and for all.

38:58.250 --> 38:59.850
Roger that, Sheppard out.

39:03.850 --> 39:07.890
You did great back there, Rodney.
Wanna take the stick?

39:08.410 --> 39:09.170
Really?

39:09.890 --> 39:10.490
No.

39:36.810 --> 39:43.970
Dr Weir, Dr McKay, Dr Beckett, welcome back.
And Lt Colonel Sheppard. Congratulations.

39:44.010 --> 39:46.250
Thank you. Anything happened while we were gone?

39:46.290 --> 39:48.050
There has been no sign of the Wraith.

39:48.055 --> 39:50.935
It would appear that they continue to believe
that Atlantis has been destroyed.

39:50.940 --> 39:55.660
But I understand that your trip
was not so happily uneventful.

39:55.690 --> 39:57.010
No, not exactly.

39:57.050 --> 39:59.850
My nose is peeling. Do you have moisturiser?

39:59.890 --> 40:00.650
Yes Rodney.

40:00.690 --> 40:01.450
Well we should get that.

40:01.490 --> 40:02.130
Yes Rodney.

40:03.050 --> 40:04.850
Any word from your offworld contacts?

40:04.890 --> 40:10.330
Well we have received several intelligence reports.
However, as of yet, there is no news of Lt Ford.

40:10.370 --> 40:12.250
I'd like to read those reports if you don't mind.

40:12.255 --> 40:14.775
I thought you might. I prepared you this copy.

40:14.780 --> 40:18.420
Thank you... Ladies.

40:20.970 --> 40:22.730
I'm sorry your journey was so difficult.

40:22.890 --> 40:26.090
Oh, well we got here. That's what counts.

40:26.450 --> 40:32.490
Still, it must have been pleasant to return to Earth.
A chance to reunite with your friends and loved ones.

40:34.250 --> 40:34.810
Dr Weir.

40:36.090 --> 40:37.650
Dr Weir, I'm glad you're back.

40:38.250 --> 40:40.650
We have several reports
with new information on the city.

40:40.690 --> 40:42.410
Ever since we installed ZPM,

40:43.450 --> 40:44.850
we've made many interesting discoveries.

40:44.890 --> 40:47.450
Can this not wait? Dr Weir has only just arrived.

40:47.490 --> 40:50.250
- I'm sorry...
- No, it's fine. Really.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.450
Let's get back to work.
