How you doing?

13:23.103 --> 13:25.470
I'm Evan Raintree.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.505
That's Dave Carson,
my mechanic.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.940
I just need a pilot.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.811
Wait a minute, did
you talk to this guy?

13:32.813 --> 13:33.845
Talk to me about what?

13:33.847 --> 13:35.046
That's my mechanic.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.414
I don't fly without
my mechanic.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.166
We're a package deal.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.917
If you want this job,
you make an exception.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.253
Okay, all right.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.488
I don't want the job.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.891
Why you got to waste
my time, Nate?

13:46.893 --> 13:49.360
(sighs)

13:49.362 --> 13:50.595
All right,
wait, wait, wait.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.963
Francis knows you.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.264
I don't.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.566
But if you check out--

13:54.568 --> 13:56.568
the both of you--
job's yours.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.837
Oh, I told you--
they're clean.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.338
Well, is this
gonna be a problem?

14:00.340 --> 14:03.174
Running your prints?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.910
No... no, it's not
gonna be a problem.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.078
(blipping)

14:08.148 --> 14:10.148
You're next, partner.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.984
Maybe we should be
checking you out, huh?

14:12.986 --> 14:14.018
Hands.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.186
Yeah, yeah,
knock yourself out.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.154
(blipping)

14:16.156 --> 14:17.455
Got it good?

14:17.457 --> 14:19.457
I'll be in touch.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.526
Okay.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.031
That went well.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.600
You know, he won't care
if you're cops.

14:28.602 --> 14:31.002
If you don't check out,
he will kill you.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.273
No worries.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.507
(blipping)

14:36.509 --> 14:38.209
Your guy works fast.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.544
He's already
run your prints.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.613
Also got chatter
on the Dark Net.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.949
DANNY: Okay, how solid

14:44.951 --> 14:47.218
are these I.D.'s
that you created for us, Jerry?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.137
They're solid so far.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.055
As long as he doesn't
dig too deep, we're good.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.891
(touchpad blipping)

14:52.893 --> 14:54.025
I think.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.293
He thinks.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.661
I'll go get my will

14:56.663 --> 14:58.062
sorted out.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.631
He's kidding, right?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.533
I have faith in you, Jerry.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.935
(touchpad beeping)
Thanks, McGruff.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.541
Hey.
Hey.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.544
So you had a sit-down
with Wo Fat's father, huh?

15:13.546 --> 15:16.414
Yeah, it, uh...

15:16.416 --> 15:20.251
it was not what I expected,
I'll tell you that.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.120
You know,

15:22.122 --> 15:23.889
if he was kept off
the grid for 40 years,

15:23.890 --> 15:25.657
how did he even know that you
were the one who killed his son?

15:25.659 --> 15:28.126
I have no idea.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.461
But his handlers
monitored the meet,

15:30.463 --> 15:32.297
and, uh, I don't know,

15:32.298 --> 15:34.132
it was clear to me that
I was just there to listen.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.935
So I take it you never
even got a chance

15:36.937 --> 15:38.569
to ask him if he knows
where your mother is?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.338
No.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.173
But what I did get
from the conversation is

15:42.175 --> 15:45.543
that he has not seen Doris for,
at least, a couple of decades,

15:45.545 --> 15:48.579
and... the people detaining him

15:48.581 --> 15:51.249
are making sure
those two don't connect.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.617
Well...

15:52.619 --> 15:54.085
forgiveness is the last thing

15:54.087 --> 15:55.720
I would ever expect
from that bloodline, so...

15:55.722 --> 15:58.323
trust me--
take it, move on.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.625
Well, it worked
for you and Abby, right?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.995
Well, seeing as she's
back in San Francisco

16:03.997 --> 16:05.563
getting her things, uh...

16:05.565 --> 16:07.665
yeah, I guess
you could say that.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.469
How do you feel about that?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.237
Well, let's just say
I'm getting used to the idea

16:13.239 --> 16:15.506
that I'm gonna have a lot
more throw pillows in my life.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.575
But...

16:17.577 --> 16:19.544
I'm good with all of it.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.645
Good.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.614
How about your niece?

16:23.616 --> 16:25.683
(sighing):
Sarah.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.053
She's still with Child Services.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.555
You know how long
that can take, right?

16:32.692 --> 16:34.625
It's not just about
finding a home, Steve.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.294
It's about finding
the right home.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.401
I see that look on your face.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.270
Don't think it hasn't
crossed my mind.

16:46.272 --> 16:49.507
(phone ringing)

16:53.179 --> 16:54.579
Yo!

en route to Oahu.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.614
And I have a serious,
serious problem.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.083
Repeat:
Mayday! Mayday!

17:32.085 --> 17:34.285
Our pilot has been shot.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.487
Request immediate assistance.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.290
CONTROLLER: This is Honolulu
International Control.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.558
We read you. Go ahead.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.593
This is, this is
Detective Danny Williams

17:42.595 --> 17:44.762
with the Five-O
task force.

17:44.764 --> 17:48.099
I need help landing this plane.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.101
You're a cop?

17:50.103 --> 17:51.736
Hey, put down the gun!

17:53.239 --> 17:54.305
You put yours down!
Put down...

17:54.307 --> 17:55.506
the gun-- I'm not
gonna ask you again.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.275
Not gonna happen.
It's really bad.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.844
Hang on... CONTROLLER:
Mayday request, do you copy?

17:59.846 --> 18:01.646
Please switch to channel 17
for immediate assist.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.614
Don't you answer that.
If I don't answer it,

18:03.616 --> 18:05.149
we're gonna die, both of us.
Either we shoot each other

18:05.150 --> 18:06.683
or this plane goes down--
you understand that?

18:06.686 --> 18:08.820
<i> Does that make sense to you?</i>

18:08.822 --> 18:09.971
CONTROLLER:
Mayday request, do you copy?

18:09.972 --> 18:11.121
Please switch to channel 17
for immediate assist.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.123
Stay awake.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.591
Steve...
(muttering)

18:13.593 --> 18:15.660
All right, you know what?

18:15.662 --> 18:18.496
You know what?

18:18.498 --> 18:20.465
<i> You want to shoot me,</i>

18:20.467 --> 18:22.600
shoot me-- go ahead--
but who's gonna fly this plane?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.335
Uh, well, apparently you
can't fly it, either.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.437
That's true, but the people
on the other end can, all right?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.672
You want to shoot me,
come sit in my lap,

18:27.674 --> 18:30.174
be my guest!
Do it, all right?

18:30.176 --> 18:31.576
Huh?

18:31.578 --> 18:32.777
Look...

18:32.779 --> 18:35.346
I promise you...

18:35.348 --> 18:36.647
I land this plane safely,

18:36.649 --> 18:38.749
you and I will pick up
right where we left off, okay?

18:38.751 --> 18:40.318
All right?!

18:40.320 --> 18:41.586
Huh?!
Fine.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.621
All right, good.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.324
Steve...

18:46.326 --> 18:49.193
Switching to channel 17.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.363
You're all right, Steve.
I'm gonna die, Danny.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.531
No, you're not.
Just hang in there.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.234
You're gonna be all right,
all right?

18:56.236 --> 18:59.871
Again, this is
Detective Danny Williams.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.639
<i> I am in a Cessna aircraft.</i>

19:01.641 --> 19:03.574
<i> I'm headed your way.</i>

19:03.576 --> 19:05.209
Our pilot, my colleague,
has been shot.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.711
He's got multiple
gunshot wounds.

19:06.713 --> 19:07.912
I need EMT standing by

19:07.914 --> 19:09.547
right when we get
this thing on the ground,

19:09.549 --> 19:11.916
which I have no clue,
zero clue how to do.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.551
Over.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.686
CONTROLLER:<i> Copy that,</i>
<i> Detective. Approach is good.</i>

19:15.688 --> 19:17.555
<i> We just need to</i>
<i> slow you down a little.</i>

19:17.557 --> 19:19.690
Okay, all right, slow us down--
h-how do I do that?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.325
Between you and the pilot
Steve.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.694
are three pull levers.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.229
The furthest to the left
is your throttle.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.598
Push it down to 25%.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.369
DANNY:
<i> Okay, done.</i>

19:31.371 --> 19:34.539
Good. Now keep both hands
on the control.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.941
Check your level.
Dead center to the pilot.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.477
Make sure you don't dip
below the horizon line.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.912
And keep your compass heading

19:40.914 --> 19:44.215
between north
and the number three.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.851
Okay, north and
number three-- got that.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.586
Buddy...?

19:48.588 --> 19:50.721
Oh, no!

19:50.723 --> 19:52.557
Steve...?
All-all right,<i> you.</i>

19:52.559 --> 19:54.525
I need you to do something
for me, all right?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.460
You focus on getting the plane
down-- do not talk to me!

19:56.462 --> 19:57.795
Listen, do what I-- do what
I tell you to do or I'm gonna

19:57.797 --> 19:59.931
drop this thing in the water--
you understand?

19:59.933 --> 20:01.866
What do you want?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.668
I want you to put
your hand on his neck,

20:03.670 --> 20:05.937
and tell me if you
feel a pulse, okay?

20:07.407 --> 20:08.940
I-I don't know! What do
you mean, you don't know?

20:08.942 --> 20:10.308
Keep your hand on his neck!

20:10.310 --> 20:11.642
Either you feel a pulse
or you don't!

20:11.644 --> 20:13.878
(alarm beeping)

20:15.582 --> 20:17.782
Uh, Control, I got,
I got an alarm,

20:17.784 --> 20:19.350
and I don't know
what it is.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.585
Check your gauges--
what do you see?

20:20.587 --> 20:21.619
What do I see?
What do I see?

20:21.621 --> 20:23.788
I see a lot of gauges!

20:23.790 --> 20:25.423
What's your airspeed?

20:25.425 --> 20:28.426
Uh, air-airspeed is 155.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.961
What about altitude?

20:29.963 --> 20:31.395
(quietly):
Altitude...

20:31.397 --> 20:32.897
Altitude's 500, but falling.

20:32.899 --> 20:33.998
Fuel?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.601
Fuel... no good.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.302
Uh, needle's right at zero.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.471
All right, you're
running out of fuel.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.611
We need to get you down
as soon as possible.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.746
Yeah. Well, it's
fine-fine with me.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.548
The Coast Guard
has been notified.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.883
<i> Stand by for emergency</i> <i> ditch procedure.
</i> (engines sputtering)

20:52.885 --> 20:54.552
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What does
he mean by "ditch"?

20:54.554 --> 20:55.553
I don't know.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.255
What do you mean by "ditch"?

20:57.256 --> 20:58.956
Detective, based on
your current altitude,

20:58.958 --> 21:01.359
airspeed and available fuel,

21:01.361 --> 21:03.628
you're never gonna
make the runway.

21:03.630 --> 21:04.729
(engines sputtering)

21:17.343 --> 21:18.542
Kono.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.911
I just got a call
from Honolulu ATC.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.947
Somebody attacked
our transport mid-flight.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.448
Steve's been shot.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.983
Shot?

21:25.985 --> 21:27.285
Is he okay?

21:28.054 --> 21:29.920
He's not responding.

21:31.357 --> 21:32.990
Who's flying the plane?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.297
What are we gonna do?

21:39.299 --> 21:40.464
He said we have to ditch.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.600
Yeah, well,
we're not ditching.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.935
(engine sputtering)

21:50.009 --> 21:51.909
Control, we just...

21:51.911 --> 21:53.010
(second engine sputtering)

21:53.012 --> 21:54.645
lost both of our engines.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.981
<i> All right, Detective,</i>
<i> beneath the dash</i>

21:56.983 --> 21:59.450
is a large red handle.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.718
Pull it to feather your prop.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.819
Don't try to fight gravity.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.921

22:03.923 --> 22:06.090
<i> Do not fight gravity,</i>

22:12.098 --> 22:13.964
All right, Detective,
next to the radio controls

22:13.966 --> 22:15.633
are your landing gear settings.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.968
There's a switch labeled
"up water."

22:17.970 --> 22:18.969
Flip it.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.438
Lower your flaps

22:20.439 --> 22:21.906
one more peg to
the landing position.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.474
(flaps clanking)

22:25.945 --> 22:27.678
Okay.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.680
Okay, done.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.681
Now you're gonna have to
put her down on the water.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.850
Adjust your course

22:32.852 --> 22:36.487
<i> to 175 degrees,</i>
<i> and let yourself glide.</i>

22:38.758 --> 22:40.057
Ah...

22:40.059 --> 22:41.826
Ah...

22:41.828 --> 22:44.795
All right, uh, control,
that's not gonna work, okay?

22:44.797 --> 22:46.697
My partner, he's...
he's unconscious.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.199
If I put this thing
down on the water,

22:48.200 --> 22:49.700
I'm not gonna be able to
get him out of the plane

22:49.702 --> 22:51.602
and he's gonna drown.

22:51.604 --> 22:54.772
<i> You don't have a choice,</i>
<i> Detective.</i>

22:54.774 --> 22:56.774
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I-I-I got a choice.

22:56.776 --> 22:59.009
I-I'm gonna put this thing
down on the beach, okay?

22:59.011 --> 23:01.779
Detective, we strongly advise
against that.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.914
(sirens wail, engines rev) <i> I understand
your concern</i> <i> for your friend,</i>

23:03.916 --> 23:05.983

CONTROLLER:
Your best chance of survival

23:09.055 --> 23:10.755
is a water landing.

DANNY:
<i> Listen, I'm not gonna</i>

23:14.827 --> 23:16.260
<i> put it down in the water.</i>

23:16.261 --> 23:17.694
I'm putting this thing down

23:17.697 --> 23:18.896
Clear the beach, I'm coming in.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.831
Hold on, Kono.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.873

23:28.875 --> 23:31.409
(exhales)
All right.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.410
Here we go.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.512
You're gonna kill all of us.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.046

<i> We have a plane coming in</i>

23:41.788 --> 23:42.887

23:42.889 --> 23:45.089

Hey, Steve, listen to me.

I know you've never been
any good at listening to me,

24:04.877 --> 24:05.976
but right now,
you got no choice,

24:05.978 --> 24:07.545
you stubborn son of a bitch.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.013
Do not die. Hey!

24:09.015 --> 24:10.498
Listen to me, do not die, okay?

24:10.499 --> 24:11.982
I'm not landing this thing
for you to die on me!

24:11.984 --> 24:13.884
You understand? Huh?

24:13.886 --> 24:15.186
Good.

No, I'm all right.

EMT said
he lost a lot of blood.

as they come, Danny, okay?

He's not gonna go out
without a fight.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.027
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.695
Hey, where you going?

27:44.696 --> 27:46.362
You need to get yourself checked out.

I want a name.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.970
(phone ringing)

30:06.972 --> 30:07.971
Hello.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.111
What is it?

30:15.514 --> 30:16.947
(sighs)

30:16.949 --> 30:17.948
It's Steve.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.483
Come on.

30:25.858 --> 30:28.058
Hey, Doc, what's going on?

30:28.060 --> 30:29.960
I'm afraid it's not good news.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.395
Commander McGarrett has suffered
a devastating trauma

30:31.397 --> 30:32.996
to his liver.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.998
A bullet has cut it into
multiple fragments,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.067
making the entire organ
inoperable.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.068
If he doesn't receive

30:38.070 --> 30:39.937
a new liver in
the next few hours,

30:39.939 --> 30:41.004
he will die.

30:49.248 --> 30:52.316
Uncle Steve was hurt pretty bad.

30:52.318 --> 30:55.219
The doctor says he
needs a new liver.

30:55.221 --> 30:58.288
But they said there's
not enough time to wait

30:58.290 --> 31:01.325
to find a donor either on
the Island or in the mainland.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.160
I'm in.
Me, too.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.584
Same here.

31:04.585 --> 31:06.007
DOCTOR:
We can certainly run some tests

31:06.008 --> 31:07.430
and determine which,
if any, of you

31:07.433 --> 31:09.266
are the correct tissue match for
Commander McGarrett. Let me, um,

31:09.268 --> 31:10.367
just save everybody some time.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.870
Uh, Steve and I
are the same blood type.

31:12.872 --> 31:15.172
Um, so just-- let's use mine.

31:15.174 --> 31:18.041
Doesn't my dad need his liver?

31:18.043 --> 31:19.543
You know, I didn't know this,

31:19.545 --> 31:22.512
but the liver is
actually an amazing organ.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.815
It can completely regenerate.

31:24.816 --> 31:27.117
So, they're gonna take half
of your father's liver

31:27.119 --> 31:28.318
and give it to Uncle Steve,

31:28.320 --> 31:30.320
and then, in time,

31:30.322 --> 31:32.256
both livers will
grow to normal size.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.597
DANNY:
<i> Doc, do me a favor.</i>

31:40.599 --> 31:42.165
Let's just go in there
and get it over with, huh?

31:42.167 --> 31:43.500
Okay.
All right?

31:43.502 --> 31:44.635
Will do.
Thanks, Doc.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.238
Hey, what are you
doing, Monkey?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.239
(groans)

31:49.241 --> 31:50.607
Hey.

31:50.608 --> 31:51.974
You know I got a
broken rib, right?

31:51.977 --> 31:53.443
What are you doing, huh?

31:53.445 --> 31:55.412
What are you upset for?

31:55.414 --> 31:57.547
Everything's gonna be
all right. I promise.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.249
Wipe those tears away.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.317
What are you doing?

32:02.388 --> 32:04.922
(sighs) CHIN: Hey.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.959
How are you holding up?

32:08.961 --> 32:11.128
First you, and now McGarrett.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.263
I'm just tired of
us getting shot at.

(sighs)

34:07.679 --> 34:09.346
We're all feeling it, Lou.

34:12.084 --> 34:14.518
You know, when
I first met McGarrett,

34:14.520 --> 34:17.421
I couldn't stand his ass.

34:17.423 --> 34:19.489
(chuckles)
(scoffs)

34:20.659 --> 34:23.160
And if you
would've told me

34:23.162 --> 34:26.363
that the day would come...

34:26.365 --> 34:30.133
when I'm in
a hospital corridor...

34:32.471 --> 34:36.306
...torn up inside, almost to
the point of tears, because...

34:38.644 --> 34:41.311
...my man is in a room,

34:41.313 --> 34:44.514
with his life
hanging in the balance...

34:44.516 --> 34:47.317
and...

34:47.319 --> 34:49.853
I swear, man,
I'd gladly take his place.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.657
I'd have told you,
you was off your meds.

34:57.362 --> 34:59.362
(sniffling, laughing)

34:59.364 --> 35:01.331
Damn, that man can get
under your skin!

35:01.333 --> 35:03.400
Yeah, yeah, he can.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.402
(laughs)

35:05.404 --> 35:07.304
(sighs)

35:07.306 --> 35:09.406
You know,
when I first lost Malia,

35:09.408 --> 35:11.575
as you might imagine,
I was in a...

35:11.577 --> 35:14.344
pretty dark place.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.346
But McGarrett...

35:16.348 --> 35:19.182
it was like he knew
I wasn't sleeping.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.184
This guy would call me up

35:21.186 --> 35:24.321
in the middle of the night
and be like,

35:24.323 --> 35:26.256
"Yo, Chin, what are you doing?"

35:26.258 --> 35:27.757
I'd be, like,

35:27.759 --> 35:29.359
"Nothing."
Nothing?

35:29.361 --> 35:30.660
(both laugh)

35:32.464 --> 35:34.698
He would say, "You want
to go grab some coffee?"

35:34.700 --> 35:37.467
<i> So we'd go to</i>
<i> this place near me.</i>

35:39.838 --> 35:42.405
<i> And we'd just sit there.</i>

35:45.344 --> 35:46.810
<i> Sometimes we would talk,</i>

35:46.812 --> 35:50.280
<i> other times, we wouldn't say</i>
<i> much of anything.</i>

35:50.282 --> 35:51.748
<i> And this went on for weeks.</i>

35:51.750 --> 35:55.886
<i> Now, he never said</i>
<i> anything to anybody.</i>

35:55.888 --> 35:58.755
<i> He never mentioned it.</i>

35:58.757 --> 36:00.757
<i> This was something he did</i>

36:00.759 --> 36:03.393
<i> because he knew</i>
<i> I couldn't bear to be alone.</i>

36:06.298 --> 36:07.664
<i> You know,</i>
<i> he was there for me,</i>

36:07.666 --> 36:09.232
<i> like, when my father died,</i>

36:09.234 --> 36:11.301
<i> John McGarrett</i>
<i> was there for me.</i>

36:13.872 --> 36:17.507
Two times in my life,
I really needed a friend...

36:17.509 --> 36:20.310
and both times that friend
was named McGarrett.

39:45.784 --> 39:46.983
Well, we have some good news.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.986
We, uh, leveraged Dae Won

into giving up his contact
on the Korean side.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.123
There's a DEA

Hey. Thought you'd want to know.

That's excellent.
Good work, everybody, good work.

39:58.997 --> 40:02.031

40:08.073 --> 40:10.673

40:10.675 --> 40:12.142
I will lose the reservation.

No, I get it. Listen,

40:16.715 --> 40:17.847

40:17.849 --> 40:19.649

40:19.651 --> 40:21.418
All right. You heard the man.

40:21.420 --> 40:22.652
Let's leave 'em alone.

40:22.654 --> 40:23.853
Hey.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.021

soon, all right?

40:25.023 --> 40:26.823
Thanks, buddy.
Yeah.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.625
Thanks, man.
Thanks, Chin. Good work.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.960
So, uh, Adam's out
four months

40:30.962 --> 40:33.062
and he's got it in his head
that you guys are going surfing.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.031
Yeah.
So... rest up.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.566
Don't worry
about him.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.100
I'm gonna take it easy on him.
He'll be fine.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.169
He'll do great.
We'll see.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.440

40:44.109 --> 40:45.642
...are indestructible.

40:45.644 --> 40:46.810

40:46.812 --> 40:48.912

40:48.914 --> 40:50.079

40:50.081 --> 40:51.798

40:51.799 --> 40:53.516
Okay, let's go, Deputy Dog.
I'll get you home.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.218
Hey, do me a favor.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.453
Don't get used to that
nickname, all right?

40:56.455 --> 40:58.188
Or him, for that matter.
Go ahead.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.057
Okay. Bye.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.058
Bye. STEVE: Bye, Charlie.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.059

41:03.061 --> 41:05.128

41:08.066 --> 41:09.499
Where's the, uh...

41:11.136 --> 41:13.503
Uh, channel 36.
There's a game on.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.939
STEVE:
No, I want to watch this.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.106
You're dangling
the Senate seat like...

41:17.108 --> 41:18.808
You're gonna make me
to watch a soap opera?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.710
A game's gonna keep me up.
I want to go to sleep.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.178
This'll put me to sleep.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.030
You want to go to sleep?

41:24.031 --> 41:25.881
I could bounce this lamp off
your head; you'll go right out.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.450
You want me to turn it up?

41:27.451 --> 41:29.017
Whoever's idea it was to have
me share a room with you

41:29.020 --> 41:31.554
to help me with my recovery
is a complete idiot.

41:31.556 --> 41:34.157
You realize you didn't have
to give me your liver.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.892
Where were you gonna
get one, Steve?

41:35.894 --> 41:36.977
At the supermarket?

41:36.978 --> 41:38.061
Of course I had
to give you my liver,

41:38.063 --> 41:39.596
what are you talking about?

41:39.598 --> 41:40.730
I'm gonna have to listen to this

41:40.732 --> 41:42.165
for the rest of my life,
aren't I?

41:42.167 --> 41:44.150
I'm gonna have to listen
to this forever,

41:44.151 --> 41:46.134
this-this-this speech about
the selfless sacrifice

41:46.137 --> 41:47.837
you made on my behalf.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.206
No, no, no, 'cause Steve,
I am not like you, okay?

41:50.208 --> 41:53.209
I give without the
expectation of thanks.

41:53.211 --> 41:54.244
Oh.
All right?

41:54.246 --> 41:55.545
And do me a favor, please.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.113
Try to take care of the thing.

41:57.114 --> 41:58.680
I had it for 39 years.
It means a lot to me, okay?

41:58.683 --> 42:00.150
You'll probably wreck it
in two weeks.

42:00.151 --> 42:01.618
How am I gonna wreck it? I don't know.
You like getting shot at.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.152
What do I know?
I like getting shot?

42:03.154 --> 42:04.854
You think I chose to get shot?

42:04.856 --> 42:06.523
How about this?

42:06.525 --> 42:07.957
If I hadn't have taken
those bullets for you,

42:07.959 --> 42:10.159
it'd be my liver in your body.
How 'bout that?

42:10.161 --> 42:11.661
Hold on.
Hold on...

42:11.663 --> 42:13.997
You didn't save my life, Steve.

42:13.999 --> 42:15.665
You were on the wrong side of
the plane when we got shot at.

42:15.667 --> 42:16.666
Okay? That's "A."

42:16.668 --> 42:18.601
"B", there is zero chance,

42:18.603 --> 42:20.103
if the roles were reversed here,

42:20.105 --> 42:21.304
you'd be giving me a piece of
your liver, okay? No chance.

42:21.306 --> 42:24.140
How can you say that?

42:24.142 --> 42:25.608
You sayin' I'm not generous
that way?

42:25.610 --> 42:27.110
No, you're not generous.

42:27.112 --> 42:28.595
I've never even seen you take
your wallet out of your pocket.

42:28.596 --> 42:30.079
There's no way you're giving me
one of your vital organs.

42:30.081 --> 42:32.182
Oy...

42:32.183 --> 42:34.284
If this liver comes with
your negative attitude,

42:34.286 --> 42:36.286
I swear to God
I'm gonna cut it out myself.

42:36.288 --> 42:38.087
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.606
It's not like I'm asking
for a "thank you," Steve.

42:39.607 --> 42:41.124
(turns up volume on TV) I'm
not saying give me a speech

42:41.126 --> 42:42.292
or a gift or
anything like that,

42:42.294 --> 42:43.826
but you... you're just...

42:43.828 --> 42:46.129
you're a big, giant ingrate.

42:46.131 --> 42:48.231
You know?

42:48.233 --> 42:50.233
My son, who I gave
bone marrow to,

42:50.235 --> 42:52.235
he was more grateful
than you are.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.737
But come to think of it,
he's four years old

42:54.739 --> 42:56.205
and he's more emotionally
mature than you,

42:56.207 --> 42:57.740
so it makes complete and total sense.
He's a kid.

42:57.742 --> 42:59.042
I promise you, Danny,

42:59.044 --> 43:00.910
you give him time,
he's gonna grow up to hate you

43:00.912 --> 43:02.245
just as much as I do.
Okay, that's enough.
