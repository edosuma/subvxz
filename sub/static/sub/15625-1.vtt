01:43.383 --> 01:45.010
This is
the Ardèche River

01:45.118 --> 01:47.086
in southern France.

01:47.187 --> 01:49.621
Less than a quarter of a mile
from here,

01:49.723 --> 01:51.748
three explorers set out

01:51.858 --> 01:57.660
a few days before Christmas
in 1994.

01:57.764 --> 02:00.699
They came along this way.

02:00.801 --> 02:05.135
They were seeking drafts of air
emanating from the ground,

02:05.238 --> 02:09.470
which would point
to the presence of caves.

02:09.576 --> 02:12.568
Eventually, they sensed
a subtle airflow

02:12.679 --> 02:14.977
and began clearing away rocks,

02:15.081 --> 02:19.643
revealing a narrow shaft
into the cliff.

02:19.753 --> 02:21.084
It was so narrow

02:21.188 --> 02:25.386
that a person could barely
squeeze through it.

02:25.492 --> 02:29.087
They descended
into the unknown.

02:29.196 --> 02:32.688
They were about to make
one of the greatest discoveries

02:32.799 --> 02:36.860
in the history
of human culture.

02:43.910 --> 02:46.470
At first,
the cave did not appear

02:46.580 --> 02:48.844
to contain anything special,

02:48.949 --> 02:52.783
aside from being
particularly beautiful.

02:58.792 --> 03:03.752
But then deep inside,
they found this.

03:16.176 --> 03:20.408
It would turn out
that this cave was pristine.

03:20.514 --> 03:26.851
It had been perfectly sealed
for tens of thousands of years.

03:26.953 --> 03:30.411
It contained by far
the oldest cave paintings,

03:30.524 --> 03:34.460
dating back
some 32,000 years.

03:34.561 --> 03:38.725
In fact, they are the oldest
paintings ever discovered,

03:38.832 --> 03:42.563
more than twice as old
as any other.

04:21.408 --> 04:25.344
In honor of its leading
discoverer, Jean-Marie Chauvet,

04:25.445 --> 04:30.781
the cave now bears the name
Chauvet Cave.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.418
This is the road
in the Ardèche Gorge

04:36.523 --> 04:39.287
leading to the cave.

04:39.392 --> 04:42.384
It is early spring.

04:42.495 --> 04:45.430
We have been given
an unprecedented endorsement

04:45.532 --> 04:47.762
by the French
Ministry of Culture

04:47.867 --> 04:51.826
to film inside the cave.

04:51.938 --> 04:54.202
From the first day
of its discovery,

04:54.307 --> 04:58.004
the importance of the cave
was immediately recognized,

04:58.111 --> 05:02.810
and access was shut off
categorically.

05:02.916 --> 05:07.979
Only a small group of
scientists is allowed to enter.

05:08.088 --> 05:11.251
They are archaeologists,
art historians,

05:11.358 --> 05:16.921
paleontologists,
and geologists, among others.

05:17.030 --> 05:20.056
They are here to perform
their studies together

05:20.166 --> 05:22.964
during a few short weeks
at the end of March

05:23.069 --> 05:25.537
and the beginning of April.

05:25.639 --> 05:27.300
This is one of the rare times

05:27.407 --> 05:30.501
anyone, with the exception
of two guards,

05:30.610 --> 05:34.512
is allowed inside the cave.

05:45.158 --> 05:51.119
The cave is like a frozen flash
of a moment in time.

05:51.231 --> 05:53.722
The reason
for its pristine condition

05:53.833 --> 05:56.427
is this rock face.

05:56.536 --> 06:00.336
Some 20,000 years ago,
it came tumbling down

06:00.440 --> 06:02.135
in a massive rock slide,

06:02.242 --> 06:05.336
sealing off the original
entrance to the cave

06:05.445 --> 06:08.903
and creating
a perfect time capsule.

06:27.967 --> 06:32.836
A wooden walkway leads to
the entrance of Chauvet Cave.

06:36.276 --> 06:39.905
The narrow tunnel through which
the discoverers crawled

06:40.013 --> 06:41.241
has been widened

06:41.347 --> 06:43.781
and locked
with a massive steel door

06:43.883 --> 06:45.976
like a bank vault.

06:49.389 --> 06:53.883
Once we pass through this door,
it will be locked behind us

06:53.993 --> 06:58.089
so as not to compromise
the delicate climate inside.

07:01.968 --> 07:05.426
For this, our first exploration
into the cave,

07:05.538 --> 07:09.634
we are using a tiny,
nonprofessional camera rig.

07:13.313 --> 07:15.838
In this first narrow
holding room,

07:15.949 --> 07:17.382
we are fitted
with sterile boots

07:17.484 --> 07:21.580
and given safety instructions.

07:24.891 --> 07:26.483
We have this, okay.

07:26.593 --> 07:28.618
Once you've set this
on the rope,

07:28.728 --> 07:29.922
you don't touch it.

07:30.029 --> 07:31.963
Jean Clottes
was the first scientist

07:32.065 --> 07:36.695
to inspect the cave
a few days after its discovery.

07:36.803 --> 07:39.567
For five years,
until his retirement,

07:39.672 --> 07:43.073
he served as head
of the scientific team.

07:51.684 --> 07:55.347
Our guide leads us
down a first sloping tunnel,

07:55.455 --> 07:59.915
which ends in a vertical drop
to the cave floor.

09:21.841 --> 09:24.036
Since our film crew
has been limited

09:24.143 --> 09:25.735
to a maximum of four,

09:25.845 --> 09:29.576
we must all perform
technical tasks.

09:29.682 --> 09:32.810
In addition,
our time in the cave

09:32.919 --> 09:35.217
has been severely restricted.

09:35.321 --> 09:37.653
And I will take one light
as well.

09:37.757 --> 09:40.453
So it's five past 3:00.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.120
We have one hour.

09:50.770 --> 09:52.761
Apart from time constrictions,

09:52.872 --> 09:55.966
we are not allowed
to touch anything in the cave

09:56.075 --> 10:00.205
or ever step off
the two-foot-wide walkway.

10:04.584 --> 10:07.917
We can use only three
flat cold light panels

10:08.021 --> 10:12.424
powered by battery belts.

10:12.525 --> 10:14.823
- You see how,
when they made the passageways,

10:14.928 --> 10:18.489
they protected
the stalagmites.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.927
It's a nice touch.

10:24.037 --> 10:27.871
Inevitably,
moving along in single file,

10:27.974 --> 10:30.636
the film crew
will have no hiding places

10:30.743 --> 10:33.837
to get out of the shot.

10:38.284 --> 10:40.809
The first large chamber
we come to

10:40.920 --> 10:44.151
is the original entrance
to the cave.

10:44.257 --> 10:47.420
In prehistoric times,
before the rock slide,

10:47.527 --> 10:50.587
daylight must have
illuminated this.

10:50.697 --> 10:53.996
- So on the left
when we arrived inside the cave,

10:54.100 --> 10:56.125
you can see the entrance,

10:56.235 --> 10:59.363
and that was
the archaeological entrance.

10:59.472 --> 11:01.531
People came
into the cave level,

11:01.641 --> 11:03.370
not like us, down a ladder.

11:03.476 --> 11:05.273
And then the cliff collapsed.

11:05.378 --> 11:09.314
And then we've got the rubble
from the cliff.

11:09.415 --> 11:11.212
From outside,
you cannot see it.

11:11.317 --> 11:12.716
From inside, you can.

11:15.788 --> 11:17.915
Over there, you've got the dots,

11:18.024 --> 11:20.891
the red dots.

11:20.994 --> 11:23.485
Those are the red dots
which I saw first

11:23.596 --> 11:26.224
when I came into the cave,

11:26.332 --> 11:30.200
big dots made with the palm
of the hand.

11:33.106 --> 11:38.544
Well, here we have... - we have
a big cave bear skull, right?

11:38.644 --> 11:40.168
Male, probably.

11:40.279 --> 11:46.081
And you'll see many others.

11:49.989 --> 11:53.789
You see, in this big chamber,
which is a really huge... -

11:53.893 --> 11:55.383
it's the biggest in the cave... -

11:55.495 --> 11:59.124
there are no paintings
except right at the end.

11:59.232 --> 12:00.824
So this is probably relevant,

12:00.933 --> 12:05.063
because when the entrance
was still open,

12:05.171 --> 12:07.298
there must have been
some light here.

12:07.407 --> 12:11.434
So they put the paintings,
really, in the complete dark.

12:15.114 --> 12:17.446
See here.

12:21.154 --> 12:24.487
This is a cave bear
painted in black.

12:24.590 --> 12:26.524
The paintings
looked so fresh

12:26.626 --> 12:29.891
that there were initial doubts
about their authenticity,

12:29.996 --> 12:31.759
but this picture has a layer

12:31.864 --> 12:34.230
of calcite and concretions
over it

12:34.333 --> 12:38.167
that take thousands of years
to grow.

12:38.271 --> 12:43.402
This was the first proof
that it was not a forgery.

12:43.509 --> 12:46.273
- A beautiful horse here,

12:46.379 --> 12:49.507
one of the most beautiful
in the cave.

12:49.615 --> 12:51.708
And what is touching

12:51.818 --> 12:57.154
is that it looks as if
it had been done yesterday.

12:57.256 --> 13:02.626
Look how fresh it looks
with that technique.

13:06.099 --> 13:08.624
And here we have,
behind the horse,

13:08.734 --> 13:12.966
there are two mammoths,
big mammoths.

13:13.072 --> 13:16.269
And here you can see
cave bear scratches,

13:16.375 --> 13:19.105
and the cave bear scratches
are not the same color.

13:19.212 --> 13:21.112
They look like
they might have been made

13:21.214 --> 13:24.615
5,000, 10,000 years earlier.

13:29.622 --> 13:32.921
We are coming here to one of
the great spots of the cave,

13:33.025 --> 13:37.359
which is the famous panel
of the horses.

13:37.463 --> 13:41.365
It is of the... - one of the size
of a small recess.

13:41.467 --> 13:43.298
And this small hole there

13:43.402 --> 13:46.633
is where water comes out,
gurgling,

13:46.739 --> 13:50.334
after there's been
something like a week of rain.

13:50.443 --> 13:53.310
And that probably explains

13:53.412 --> 13:59.840
why all those animals
were painted around that hole.

13:59.952 --> 14:06.221
It's one of the great works
of art in the world.

14:08.694 --> 14:11.686
For these Paleolithic painters,

14:11.797 --> 14:14.994
the play of light and shadows
from their torches

14:15.101 --> 14:19.037
could possibly have looked
something like this.

14:21.641 --> 14:27.876
For them, the animals perhaps
appeared moving, living.

14:27.980 --> 14:31.143
We should note that the artists
painted this bison

14:31.250 --> 14:34.481
with eight legs,
suggesting movement,

14:34.587 --> 14:38.421
almost a form of proto-cinema.

14:49.335 --> 14:51.701
The walls themselves
are not flat

14:51.804 --> 14:54.739
but have their own
three-dimensional dynamic,

14:54.840 --> 15:01.268
their own movement, which was
utilized by the artists.

15:01.380 --> 15:06.181
In the upper left corner,
another multilegged animal.

15:06.285 --> 15:08.480
And the rhino to the right

15:08.588 --> 15:11.785
seems also to have
the illusion of movement,

15:11.891 --> 15:15.759
like frames
in an animated film.

15:27.840 --> 15:31.003
The painters of the cave
seem to speak to us

15:31.110 --> 15:35.137
from a familiar
yet distant universe.

15:35.248 --> 15:37.216
But what we are seeing here

15:37.316 --> 15:41.013
is part of millions
of spatial points.

15:45.891 --> 15:49.622
Today scientists have mapped
every single millimeter

15:49.729 --> 15:53.893
of the cave
using laser scanners.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.334
The position of every feature
in the cave is known.

16:04.777 --> 16:08.736
This is the shape of the cave
in its entirety.

16:08.848 --> 16:15.253
From end to end,
it is about 1,300 feet long.

16:15.354 --> 16:16.616
This map is the basis

16:16.722 --> 16:20.749
for all scientific projects
being done here.

16:24.964 --> 16:31.528
- We are working to create
new understanding of the cave

16:31.637 --> 16:35.971
through that precision,
through scientific methods,

16:36.075 --> 16:40.603
but that's not, I think,
the main goal.

16:40.713 --> 16:43.511
The main goal
is to create stories

16:43.616 --> 16:48.212
about what could have happened
in that cave during the past.

16:48.321 --> 16:49.686
It is like
you are creating

16:49.789 --> 16:51.848
the phone directory
of Manhattan.

16:51.957 --> 16:56.621
Four million precise entries,
but do they dream?

16:56.729 --> 16:58.856
Do they cry at night?

16:58.964 --> 17:00.295
What are their hopes?

17:00.399 --> 17:01.866
What are their families?

17:01.967 --> 17:04.094
You'll... - we'll never know
from the phone directory.

17:04.203 --> 17:05.636
- Definitely.

17:05.738 --> 17:09.503
We will never know,
because past is definitely lost.

17:09.608 --> 17:12.599
We will never reconstruct
the past.

17:12.712 --> 17:15.078
We can only create
a representation

17:15.181 --> 17:19.015
of what alre... -
what exists now, today.

17:19.117 --> 17:20.813
You are a human being.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.114
I am a human being.

17:22.221 --> 17:25.315
And here when you come
to that cave,

17:25.424 --> 17:27.186
of course there are some things.

17:27.292 --> 17:29.124
I have my own background.

17:29.228 --> 17:31.219
What is your background,
if I may ask?

17:31.330 --> 17:34.060
- Well, I used to be
a circus man before,

17:34.166 --> 17:35.793
but I switched to archaeology.

17:35.901 --> 17:37.061
Circus?

17:37.169 --> 17:39.103
Doing what?
Lion tamer?

17:39.205 --> 17:41.469
- Well, mostly... -
not lion tamer,

17:41.574 --> 17:45.840
but mostly unicycle
and juggling, yeah.

17:45.945 --> 17:49.278
The first time I entered
to Chauvet Cave,

17:49.382 --> 17:53.284
I had a chance to get in
during five days,

17:53.386 --> 17:56.116
and it was so powerful.

17:56.222 --> 18:00.989
Then every night,
I was dreaming of lions.

18:01.093 --> 18:05.086
And every day was
the same shock for me.

18:05.197 --> 18:06.960
It was an emotional shock.

18:07.066 --> 18:10.832
I mean, I'm a scientist
but a human too.

18:10.936 --> 18:15.703
And after five days, I decided
not to go back in the cave,

18:15.808 --> 18:22.475
because I needed time
just to relax and take time to... -

18:22.581 --> 18:23.548
To absorb it?

18:23.649 --> 18:25.412
- To absorb it, yeah.
Yeah.

18:25.518 --> 18:28.282
And you dreamt
not of paintings of lions

18:28.387 --> 18:29.911
but of real lions.

18:30.022 --> 18:33.150
- Of both, of both, definitely.

18:33.259 --> 18:34.556
Yeah.

18:34.660 --> 18:36.560
And you were afraid
in your dreams?

18:36.662 --> 18:38.095
- I was not afraid, no.

18:38.197 --> 18:39.391
No, no, I was not afraid.

18:39.498 --> 18:47.701
It was more a feeling of
powerful things and deep things,

18:47.807 --> 18:55.578
a way to understand things
which is not a direct way.

18:55.681 --> 18:56.943
- Uh, sorry.

18:57.049 --> 18:59.040
Silence, please.

18:59.151 --> 19:00.778
Please don't move.

19:00.886 --> 19:03.855
We're going to listen
to the silence in the cave,

19:03.956 --> 19:09.121
and perhaps we can even hear
our own heartbeats.

22:35.501 --> 22:37.128
These images
are memories

22:37.236 --> 22:41.195
of long-forgotten dreams.

22:41.306 --> 22:46.505
Is this their heartbeat
or ours?

22:46.612 --> 22:49.445
Will we ever be able
to understand the vision

22:49.548 --> 22:54.417
of the artists
across such an abyss of time?

22:58.724 --> 23:03.991
There is an aura of melodrame
in this landscape.

23:04.096 --> 23:07.532
It could be straight out
of a Wagner opera

23:07.633 --> 23:11.399
or a painting
of German Romanticists.

23:11.503 --> 23:15.837
Could this be our connection
to them?

23:15.941 --> 23:19.672
This staging of a landscape
as an operatic event

23:19.778 --> 23:23.373
does not belong
to the Romanticists alone.

23:23.482 --> 23:26.474
Stone Age men might have had
a similar sense

23:26.585 --> 23:29.611
of inner landscapes,
and it seems natural

23:29.722 --> 23:32.987
that there's a whole cluster
of Paleolithic caves

23:33.092 --> 23:34.787
right around here.

23:36.161 --> 23:39.255
- The Chauvet Cave is just here
at the top of this cliff,

23:39.364 --> 23:42.697
but the Chauvet Cave
is also associated

23:42.801 --> 23:44.359
to this natural feature,

23:44.470 --> 23:48.566
this beautiful arch
called Pont d'Arc.

23:48.674 --> 23:53.475
Maybe this Pont d'Arc,
in the mythology of the people,

23:53.579 --> 23:57.982
was not only a landmark
but a mark also

23:58.083 --> 24:01.314
in the imagination,
in the stories,

24:01.420 --> 24:02.819
in the mythology

24:02.921 --> 24:06.652
that was important for them
to understand the world.

24:06.759 --> 24:09.819
But what kind
of world was it

24:09.928 --> 24:12.453
for Paleolithic people
back then?

24:12.564 --> 24:16.227
- 35,000 years ago,
the Europe... -

24:16.335 --> 24:20.897
Europe was covered by glaciers,
and in this glacial Europe,

24:21.006 --> 24:27.241
you have to imagine a climate
dry, cold, but with sun also.

24:27.346 --> 24:28.745
That was important.

24:28.847 --> 24:31.839
In this place, for example,

24:31.950 --> 24:34.009
you have to imagine
woolly rhinos,

24:34.119 --> 24:35.882
mammoths along the rivers.

24:35.988 --> 24:37.615
In the forest,

24:37.723 --> 24:43.161
you had Megaloceros deers,
horses, reindeers, bisons,

24:43.262 --> 24:46.561
and also ibex
or the antelopes moving.

24:46.665 --> 24:48.633
So it was very rich.

24:48.734 --> 24:51.032
The biomass
in this part of Europe

24:51.136 --> 24:53.229
was very important

24:53.338 --> 24:56.637
for the development of human
but also carnivores.

24:56.742 --> 25:01.076
So you have to imagine
lions, bears, leopards,

25:01.180 --> 25:05.674
wolves,
foxes in very large numbers.

25:05.784 --> 25:10.915
And among all these carnivores
and predators, human.

25:11.023 --> 25:14.584
Could it be how they
set up fires in Chauvet Cave?

25:14.693 --> 25:17.821
There's evidence that they cast
their own shadows

25:17.930 --> 25:21.161
against the panels of horses,
for example.

25:21.266 --> 25:24.724
- The fire were necessary
to look at the paintings

25:24.837 --> 25:29.001
and maybe towards
staging people around.

25:29.107 --> 25:32.270
When you look with the flame,
with moving light,

25:32.377 --> 25:35.437
you can imagine people dancing
with the shadows.

25:35.547 --> 25:36.605
Like Fred Astaire.

25:36.715 --> 25:38.307
- Fred Astaire, yes.

25:38.417 --> 25:42.285
I think that this image
dancing with this shadow

25:42.387 --> 25:47.723
is a very strong and old images
of human representation,

25:47.826 --> 25:50.624
because the first representation
was the walls,

25:50.729 --> 25:53.391
the white wall
and the black shadow.

26:13.318 --> 26:15.582
The presence of humans
in the cave

26:15.687 --> 26:19.316
was fleeting like shadows.

26:19.424 --> 26:22.450
Bear skulls everywhere,

26:22.561 --> 26:25.291
but these skulls belong
to the cave bear,

26:25.397 --> 26:29.231
a species, like the mammoth
and the woolly rhino,

26:29.334 --> 26:33.327
that vanished from the face
of the Earth long ago.

26:42.381 --> 26:46.442
Tens of thousands of years
of patient water dripping

26:46.551 --> 26:51.181
has left a thick coating
of calcite on this skull.

26:51.290 --> 26:55.124
It now has the appearance
of a porcelain sculpture.

27:15.981 --> 27:18.415
In all this menagerie of bones,

27:18.517 --> 27:22.248
there's not a single
human specimen.

27:22.354 --> 27:27.690
Scientists have determined that
humans never lived in the cave.

27:27.793 --> 27:34.722
They used it only for painting
and possibly ceremonies.

27:34.833 --> 27:39.167
Michel Philipe has studied
the bones of Chauvet Cave.

27:41.807 --> 27:43.866
Caves
constitute a favorable place

27:43.976 --> 27:45.671
for the preservation of bones.

27:45.777 --> 27:48.439
As the result,
there are a lot of bear bones.

27:48.547 --> 27:52.142
Overall, this represents
99% of the finds,

27:52.250 --> 27:53.774
but there are also some wolves.

27:53.885 --> 27:56.479
We have two skulls
and have several bones.

27:56.588 --> 27:58.613
We have a few ibexes.

27:58.724 --> 28:01.591
We have a magnificent skull
on the wet sand with calcite,

28:01.693 --> 28:03.718
quite lovely.

28:03.829 --> 28:05.353
When you shine light on it,

28:05.464 --> 28:07.864
they are calcite crystals
that glisten.

28:07.966 --> 28:09.490
It's truly quite lovely.

28:09.601 --> 28:11.466
There are some horses as well.

28:11.570 --> 28:13.435
There is a cave hyena.

28:13.538 --> 28:15.369
What else is there?

28:15.474 --> 28:17.840
There's also an eagle skeleton,

28:17.943 --> 28:21.970
a golden eagle,
practically whole,

28:22.080 --> 28:23.741
but it may be
a little more recent,

28:23.849 --> 28:25.578
carried in by the run of water

28:25.684 --> 28:28.915
and wedged against the big rocks
at the edge of the waterway.

28:29.021 --> 28:30.682
So you can see its bones
spread out

28:30.789 --> 28:32.916
over ten feet in length.

28:33.025 --> 28:35.459
Our goal is not only to say
what bones there are,

28:35.560 --> 28:38.256
but we also try to understand
if they lived there,

28:38.363 --> 28:41.298
if they were moved,
how they were transported.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.197
Did the bears bring the bones?

28:43.301 --> 28:45.997
There are several bones that
have been chewed on a little.

28:46.104 --> 28:50.598
So it could have been the bears
or the hyenas.

28:53.578 --> 28:55.136
All the scientists
are lodged

28:55.247 --> 28:59.479
in a nearby sports complex.

28:59.584 --> 29:02.382
Although they each have
their special field,

29:02.487 --> 29:07.356
they compare and combine
their findings.

29:07.459 --> 29:10.553
We were interested in the work
of these two.

29:10.662 --> 29:15.827
Carole, Gilles, can you explain
about what you're doing here?

29:15.934 --> 29:16.866
- Yeah, oui.

29:19.304 --> 29:20.601
In the cave,

29:20.705 --> 29:22.400
we are trying to reveal
the contours

29:22.507 --> 29:23.974
of underlying designs

29:24.076 --> 29:26.636
that are hard to follow
with the naked eye.

29:26.745 --> 29:29.543
Because we are not supposed
to touch the wall,

29:29.648 --> 29:34.676
we take a series of photos that
we put together in a mosaic.

29:34.786 --> 29:37.846
We are trying to achieve
a maximum of detail.

29:37.956 --> 29:40.254
Then we take a transparency,

29:40.358 --> 29:42.326
and we put it
on top of the photo.

29:42.427 --> 29:46.056
And then we trace
the underlayers of engravings.

29:46.164 --> 29:50.260
Later, we return to the cave
and check against the contours

29:50.368 --> 29:52.768
all the designs that we can see

29:52.871 --> 29:55.396
and all the markings
of the bears as well

29:55.507 --> 29:59.637
so that we can understand
each figure and event.

29:59.744 --> 30:01.268
We have bear scratches

30:01.379 --> 30:04.780
and then a magnificent drawing
of a mammoth done by finger

30:04.883 --> 30:07.317
and other scratches
done over the mammoth.

30:07.419 --> 30:09.284
So their succession
is very important

30:09.387 --> 30:11.787
to understand what took place.

30:11.890 --> 30:15.291
On the computer,
one can see three phases.

30:15.393 --> 30:18.521
The first dates 40,000 years
back in time,

30:18.630 --> 30:22.327
the one when the bear
scratched the walls.

30:22.434 --> 30:24.868
Then a second phase
with drawings

30:24.970 --> 30:27.234
stretching over eight feet
in height,

30:27.339 --> 30:31.207
therefore made with a stick,
followed by the main phase

30:31.309 --> 30:36.440
sometime around 33,000 years
or less.

30:36.548 --> 30:39.278
It starts
with the scraping of the wall

30:39.384 --> 30:41.181
to get to the white of the rock.

30:41.286 --> 30:43.618
After that, the first figures
were put in place.

30:43.722 --> 30:45.519
These were the two rhinos
attacking one another

30:45.624 --> 30:47.057
at the bottom.

30:47.159 --> 30:49.684
After that came
the three bulls.

30:49.794 --> 30:52.456
- And finally, they ended

30:52.564 --> 30:55.795
with a series of horses
going from top to bottom

30:55.901 --> 30:59.769
and, in the final phase,
adding this very beautiful horse

30:59.871 --> 31:03.898
that confronts the viewers
when they arrive in the cave.

31:04.009 --> 31:06.102
- When you do a synthesis
of the composition,

31:06.211 --> 31:08.645
there is a kind of dynamic
circular movement

31:08.747 --> 31:10.510
going from the bottom
to the right,

31:10.615 --> 31:12.640
towards the center,
like a circle.

31:12.751 --> 31:15.413
It obviously creates
a very strong dynamic

31:15.520 --> 31:16.851
that is reinforced here

31:16.955 --> 31:20.288
by the oblique movement
of the horses.

31:20.392 --> 31:22.451
- It's the force
of the contrast,

31:22.561 --> 31:24.859
the fact that they've played
with the contrast

31:24.963 --> 31:27.989
and with the shape of the wall.

31:34.039 --> 31:35.404
It's like an easel.

31:35.507 --> 31:38.271
They've used the surface,
made use of the material,

31:38.376 --> 31:43.143
and mixed material to create
this very strong impression.

31:45.784 --> 31:49.185
By comparing
all the paintings in the cave,

31:49.287 --> 31:52.222
it seems certain
that the horses of this panel

31:52.324 --> 31:57.887
were created
by one single individual.

31:57.996 --> 32:01.432
But in the immediate vicinity
of the horses,

32:01.533 --> 32:06.402
there are figures of animals
overlapping with each other.

32:06.504 --> 32:08.062
The striking point here

32:08.173 --> 32:12.439
is that in cases like this,
after carbon dating,

32:12.544 --> 32:14.444
there are strong indications

32:14.546 --> 32:16.912
that some overlapping figures
were drawn

32:17.015 --> 32:20.576
almost 5,000 years apart.

32:23.688 --> 32:26.122
The sequence
and duration of time

32:26.224 --> 32:29.591
is unimaginable for us today.

32:29.694 --> 32:34.961
We are locked in history,
and they were not.

32:37.902 --> 32:40.166
Despite this blurring of time

32:40.272 --> 32:42.502
and the anonymity
of the artists,

32:42.607 --> 32:48.944
there's one individual
who can be singled out.

32:49.047 --> 32:52.847
Dominique Baffier is a scholar
of Paleolithic culture.

32:52.951 --> 32:57.445
Here on the right, she examines
the cluster of palm prints

32:57.555 --> 33:00.524
with her colleague
Valérie Feruglio.

33:06.631 --> 33:08.326
We are currently working

33:08.433 --> 33:09.525
on this large panel

33:09.634 --> 33:12.102
that was covered
with positive handprints.

33:12.203 --> 33:14.603
We've been able to put forward,
as evidence,

33:14.706 --> 33:17.470
the number of positions
the individual assumed

33:17.575 --> 33:19.475
and his movements.

33:19.577 --> 33:24.105
He started by crouching,
and then he stretched out

33:24.215 --> 33:26.877
to reach all the way
to his highest palm prints.

33:26.985 --> 33:30.716
This panel is comprised
of the prints of a single man

33:30.822 --> 33:34.849
who must have measured
roughly six feet tall.

33:34.959 --> 33:36.893
A single human.

33:36.995 --> 33:39.327
- 1 meter 80 tall, that's big.

33:39.431 --> 33:41.194
Was it only one person?

33:41.299 --> 33:42.596
- Une personne, une personne.

33:42.701 --> 33:46.364
One person,
a person measuring six feet.

33:46.471 --> 33:48.268
And you'll notice
on these prints

33:48.373 --> 33:51.035
that there is
a very significant detail.

33:51.142 --> 33:54.043
He has a slightly crooked
little finger.

33:54.145 --> 33:55.510
And that's extraordinary,

33:55.613 --> 33:57.979
because it gives
a physical reality

33:58.083 --> 34:02.577
to a prehistoric individual
who, 32,000 years or more ago,

34:02.687 --> 34:05.815
came to the cave before us.

34:05.924 --> 34:08.415
And what is even more surprising

34:08.525 --> 34:11.824
is that you'll find traces
of him deeper in the cavern.

34:11.929 --> 34:15.366
We'll be able to recognize him
by his crooked little finger,

34:15.467 --> 34:18.697
because he printed his hand
farther in the cave.

34:18.803 --> 34:22.431
So we can follow
this man's path.

34:25.510 --> 34:28.103
Madame Baffier
took us on a tour.

34:28.213 --> 34:31.512
She serves as the custodian
of the cave,

34:31.616 --> 34:33.811
and her rules of engagement
are strict

34:33.918 --> 34:35.681
but entirely reasonable

34:35.786 --> 34:38.620
given the precious
and fragile nature

34:38.723 --> 34:41.317
of this unique place.

34:48.132 --> 34:50.658
- You have cave bear tracks,

34:50.768 --> 34:53.431
the forepaws and hind paws.

34:53.538 --> 34:56.199
These are the longest
cave bear tracks

34:56.306 --> 34:59.799
currently known in any cave.

35:18.630 --> 35:20.359
It's very sparkly.

35:20.465 --> 35:23.832
There are crystals
that glitter.

35:37.582 --> 35:42.451
Here at this junction, we have
the panel of the panther.

35:42.554 --> 35:44.647
You can see the drawing
of a panther,

35:44.756 --> 35:48.021
which is the only one known
in Paleolithic wall painting

35:48.126 --> 35:50.117
to date.

35:57.368 --> 35:59.268
Here we've arrived at a place

35:59.370 --> 36:03.136
where concretion growth
has been very important.

36:03.241 --> 36:06.472
On the ground and walls,
you can see

36:06.578 --> 36:10.480
that rimstone calcite ridges
have covered everything

36:10.582 --> 36:15.815
in sparkling formation,
a kind of cascade...

36:26.531 --> 36:29.864
With waves.

36:45.216 --> 36:49.243
Here you have... - take a look... -
a bear vertebra

36:49.354 --> 36:52.414
which is entirely coated
in calcite

36:52.524 --> 36:56.654
and held by calcite crystals.

37:02.901 --> 37:05.597
In front of us, on the wall,

37:05.703 --> 37:10.538
you also have an overflowing
drapery-like concretion

37:10.642 --> 37:13.202
and here a kind of niche

37:13.311 --> 37:17.247
where you can see the traces
of ancient red paintings,

37:17.348 --> 37:20.613
which have been washed away
by water seepage.

37:20.718 --> 37:25.417
And this is where you find
extremely original images,

37:25.523 --> 37:28.424
like this insect-shaped one

37:28.526 --> 37:31.154
or this one shaped like
a butterfly

37:31.262 --> 37:36.256
or a bird in flight,

37:36.367 --> 37:39.734
that you also find
on this rock pendant

37:39.837 --> 37:44.297
hanging from the ceiling
large and very small

37:44.409 --> 37:47.071
coupled with two vertical
ocher stripes

37:47.178 --> 37:51.239
that follow
the pendant's contours.

38:09.133 --> 38:10.259
So here we are in front of

38:10.368 --> 38:12.632
the large panel
of red paintings,

38:12.737 --> 38:15.433
also an extremely
intriguing item:

38:15.540 --> 38:17.565
this mound of stones.

38:17.675 --> 38:20.200
You can see that it didn't fall
from the ceiling.

38:20.311 --> 38:23.474
It was prehistoric man
who grouped the stones here,

38:23.581 --> 38:26.106
but we do not know why.

38:32.991 --> 38:35.653
On this panel, you have,
first of all,

38:35.760 --> 38:38.661
a little rhinoceros
with a large horn

38:38.763 --> 38:40.856
and a stripe on the abdomen.

38:40.965 --> 38:44.833
Also, you have
a whole series underneath

38:44.936 --> 38:47.530
of positive handprints.

38:47.639 --> 38:49.971
And over there,
you can see the hand

38:50.074 --> 38:52.065
of the man
who printed his palms

38:52.176 --> 38:53.939
in the first room of the cave,

38:54.045 --> 38:58.482
because you can recognize
his crooked little finger.

38:58.583 --> 39:01.848
In other words,
we've followed him here.

39:04.288 --> 39:06.756
Here there are some animals

39:06.858 --> 39:10.225
and here the front part
of a big rhinoceros

39:10.328 --> 39:14.355
with a very large horn.

39:16.401 --> 39:18.995
Here you have
torch swipe marks.

39:19.103 --> 39:21.663
The men would light their way
with a torch,

39:21.773 --> 39:24.105
and when the wood
was too burnt down,

39:24.208 --> 39:26.938
they would scrape the torch
against the wall

39:27.045 --> 39:28.808
to rekindle the flame.

39:28.913 --> 39:31.609
The traces are fresh,
because you can see

39:31.716 --> 39:35.379
these small fragments of coal
that have fallen.

39:38.456 --> 39:40.481
One of these
tiny fragments

39:40.591 --> 39:43.424
was tested
by radiocarbon dating.

39:43.528 --> 39:49.558
This torch was swiped
28,000 years ago.

39:53.304 --> 39:57.001
- And here we have a painting
that is quite interesting,

39:57.108 --> 40:01.636
because it represents a couple
of now-extinct cave lions.

40:01.746 --> 40:03.373
You have here the male.

40:03.481 --> 40:06.075
He's behind, the larger one.

40:06.184 --> 40:08.414
He's outlined
in a single stroke

40:08.519 --> 40:11.784
more than six feet in length.

40:11.889 --> 40:14.858
And in front,
you have the female.

40:14.959 --> 40:21.159
She is smaller and seems to rub
her flank against the male.

40:21.265 --> 40:24.723
And this representation
of the cave lion

40:24.836 --> 40:27.669
has allowed us to shed light
on a mystery,

40:27.772 --> 40:30.741
because archaeozoologists
didn't know

40:30.842 --> 40:33.310
whether the cave lion
had a mane,

40:33.411 --> 40:36.005
like the lion today
living in Africa.

40:36.114 --> 40:38.912
And this representation
of a cave lion,

40:39.016 --> 40:41.382
more than 30,000 years old,

40:41.486 --> 40:45.320
shows us
that they didn't have a mane.

40:45.423 --> 40:50.156
Look at the outline of his head,
which is clearly delineated.

40:53.831 --> 40:56.322
And this is, without a doubt,
a male,

40:56.434 --> 41:00.928
because we've got the scrotum
right here under the tail.

41:13.851 --> 41:17.685
This is one of the most
beautiful panels in the cave,

41:17.789 --> 41:21.020
along with the lion panel
at the far end.

41:21.125 --> 41:22.854
And here we can see

41:22.960 --> 41:25.053
the technique
of prehistoric man,

41:25.163 --> 41:27.893
but you can also see
their keen knowledge

41:27.999 --> 41:29.626
of the animal world.

41:29.734 --> 41:31.725
They tell us stories.

41:31.836 --> 41:34.100
Here you have
an ensemble of horses,

41:34.205 --> 41:37.504
but their open mouths suggest
that the animals are whinnying.

41:37.608 --> 41:39.371
That is to say
that these images

41:39.477 --> 41:41.274
become audible to us.

41:41.379 --> 41:45.213
You see that the two rhinos
there are fighting.

41:45.316 --> 41:48.717
You can see all the signs
of fury towards each other,

41:48.820 --> 41:52.187
the movement of their legs,
which are thrown forward,

41:52.290 --> 41:56.852
and you can almost hear
the sound

41:56.961 --> 42:00.021
of their horns colliding
against each other

42:00.131 --> 42:02.258
in the movement of the fight.

42:02.366 --> 42:06.769
Here you have another story,
a story of lions,

42:06.871 --> 42:10.272
a male courting a female
who is not ready for mating.

42:10.374 --> 42:12.808
She sits and growls.

42:12.910 --> 42:16.141
Look, you can hear
the female growling.

42:16.247 --> 42:18.010
She's raising her lips.

42:18.115 --> 42:19.605
She's baring her teeth.

42:19.717 --> 42:21.275
She is not happy.

42:21.385 --> 42:23.853
And here, to finish off,

42:23.955 --> 42:26.116
you have the flight
of this bison.

42:26.224 --> 42:27.623
We hear the hooves.

42:27.725 --> 42:31.286
We can make out multiple legs
indicating its movement.

42:31.395 --> 42:33.590
It is escaping
from this alcove,

42:33.698 --> 42:36.326
following this auroch.

42:40.805 --> 42:42.773
Madame Baffier
takes us down

42:42.874 --> 42:45.672
to the farthest chamber
of the cave,

42:45.776 --> 42:49.712
the mysterious chamber
of the lions.

42:49.814 --> 42:54.114
There is a serious level
of toxic CO2 gas

42:54.218 --> 42:56.584
emanating from the roots
of trees,

42:56.687 --> 43:02.319
which seeps down into the cave
through the porous limestone.

43:02.426 --> 43:07.056
Our time is even more
constricted in this location,

43:07.164 --> 43:12.864
and there is no possibility
to get close to the paintings.

43:12.970 --> 43:14.403
- Unfortunately,

43:14.505 --> 43:17.406
there are things you won't
be able to show in your film

43:17.508 --> 43:19.533
and you won't be able to see.

43:19.644 --> 43:21.737
You can't get closer.

43:21.846 --> 43:24.679
That is the case with these
absolutely marvelous paintings

43:24.782 --> 43:28.309
in the farthest chamber,
this grouping of lions.

43:28.419 --> 43:31.718
It is especially the case
with this rock pendant,

43:31.822 --> 43:34.086
where the lower portion
of a woman's body

43:34.191 --> 43:35.852
has been painted.

43:35.960 --> 43:38.724
That is, you have
her pubic triangle

43:38.829 --> 43:42.390
and her legs that separate,
starting at the knee,

43:42.500 --> 43:44.934
which diverge
and are reminiscent

43:45.036 --> 43:48.164
of the well-known small
early Stone Age statuettes

43:48.272 --> 43:52.606
from archaeological digs
in the Swabian Jura in Germany.

43:52.710 --> 43:56.703
We can only see part of this
lower half of a female body,

43:56.814 --> 44:00.511
because we cannot access
the other side of the pendant.

44:00.618 --> 44:02.586
You can not walk
on these grounds,

44:02.687 --> 44:04.678
because they are too fragile.

44:04.789 --> 44:07.690
You would destroy
the charcoal remains.

44:07.792 --> 44:09.555
You would destroy the tracks

44:09.660 --> 44:12.060
left by the bears
and the humans.

44:12.163 --> 44:15.963
So you'll have to make do
with this partial image.

44:16.067 --> 44:19.093
If you completed the other half
of this female body

44:19.203 --> 44:21.364
with its other legs
symmetrically,

44:21.472 --> 44:24.669
you could see that it is
connected to a bison head

44:24.775 --> 44:27.175
that would have
a somewhat human arm.

44:27.278 --> 44:31.305
And here we are,
some 30,000 years later,

44:31.415 --> 44:35.511
with a myth that has endured
until our days.

44:35.619 --> 44:37.678
We can also find
this association

44:37.788 --> 44:39.221
of female and bull

44:39.323 --> 44:45.728
in Picasso's drawings
of the Minotaur and the woman.

44:45.830 --> 44:49.926
This is the only
partial representation

44:50.034 --> 44:53.060
of a human
in the entire cave.

44:53.170 --> 44:54.933
For the time being,

44:55.039 --> 44:57.337
the other side
of the rock pendant

44:57.441 --> 45:02.140
must remain unreachable for us.

45:02.246 --> 45:07.149
The people who created this
are equally enigmatic.

45:07.251 --> 45:09.981
Of the few things
they left behind,

45:10.087 --> 45:12.749
practical items
like flint tools

45:12.857 --> 45:16.156
can be more easily read.

45:16.260 --> 45:17.818
- All the boxes...

45:17.928 --> 45:19.361
The local museum
is filled

45:19.463 --> 45:21.624
with artifacts from the region.

45:21.732 --> 45:25.099
- Because we have made
some excavation in the site.

45:25.202 --> 45:27.693
But Jean-Michel Geneste
- can only lead us

45:27.805 --> 45:30.535
to a handful of findings
from Chauvet Cave.

45:30.641 --> 45:31.801
- Things are preserved.

45:31.909 --> 45:35.037
You have only two, three boxes
in this area,

45:35.146 --> 45:37.080
but I have prepared
for you some...

45:37.181 --> 45:39.945
To shed light
on the enigmatic female image,

45:40.051 --> 45:44.078
he has prepared some similar
figurines from other regions.

45:44.188 --> 45:46.122
- Very precious for archaeology.

45:46.223 --> 45:52.093
You can see,
like in this Willendorf Venus,

45:52.196 --> 45:56.633
it's a copy made in limestone,
found in Austria,

45:56.734 --> 45:58.964
from the same period.

45:59.070 --> 46:00.662
In the Chauvet Cave,

46:00.771 --> 46:04.138
you have only the lower part
of the belly preserved.

46:04.241 --> 46:07.039
It's embedded in a bison.

46:07.144 --> 46:08.839
There seems
to have existed

46:08.946 --> 46:10.208
a visual convention

46:10.314 --> 46:14.341
extending all the way
beyond Baywatch.

46:17.088 --> 46:19.989
- No male representation
very clearly found

46:20.091 --> 46:22.559
but this lion man.

46:22.660 --> 46:24.150
It comes from a site,

46:24.261 --> 46:27.458
Hohlenstein-Stadel
in Swabian Alps.

46:27.565 --> 46:32.696
What is amazing, it's a mixture

46:32.803 --> 46:37.365
between
an anthropomorphic shape,

46:37.475 --> 46:41.502
a human body,
and the head of a lion.

46:41.612 --> 46:45.241
Is it the spirit of the... -
of a lion in a man?

46:45.349 --> 46:47.283
Is it a marriage?

46:47.384 --> 46:49.147
Is it a new being?

46:49.253 --> 46:53.849
That's a question we can ask
to this reproduction.

46:58.496 --> 47:00.361
What the people
who lived in this valley

47:00.464 --> 47:03.524
left behind
is their great art.

47:03.634 --> 47:05.329
It was not
a primitive beginning

47:05.436 --> 47:07.336
or a slow evolution,;

47:07.438 --> 47:12.535
it rather burst onto the scene
like a sudden explosive event.

47:12.643 --> 47:19.014
It is as if the modern
human soul had awakened here.

47:19.116 --> 47:22.517
Even more astonishing to
consider is that at the time,

47:22.620 --> 47:27.683
Neanderthal man still roamed
this valley.

47:27.791 --> 47:32.057
But there must have been other
forms of artistic expression,

47:32.163 --> 47:34.961
like music, for example.

47:35.065 --> 47:39.934
For this, we had to look around
in nearby regions.

47:40.037 --> 47:44.337
Southwestern Germany
30,000, 40,000 years ago

47:44.441 --> 47:50.038
was connected to this valley
through an ice-free corridor.

47:50.147 --> 47:53.446
It should also be noted that
the Alp Mountains were covered

47:53.551 --> 47:57.282
by 9,000 feet of ice,
binding so much water

47:57.388 --> 48:03.588
that the sea level
was 300 feet lower than today.

48:03.694 --> 48:06.663
A hunter could have walked
from Paris to London

48:06.764 --> 48:11.963
crossing the dry seabed
of the English Channel.

48:12.069 --> 48:14.537
Walking 400 miles
in this direction

48:14.638 --> 48:18.540
would lead you
to the Swabian Alb of Germany.

48:21.946 --> 48:24.312
There, in the museum
of Blaubeuren,

48:24.415 --> 48:29.614
we find replicas of the
best-known Paleolithic Venuses.

48:42.499 --> 48:46.936
But this one, the Venus
of Hohle Fels, stands out.

48:47.037 --> 48:53.272
Found in 2008,
it is sensational for its age.

48:56.380 --> 48:59.781
- The Venus from Hohle Fels
is probably the oldest depiction

48:59.883 --> 49:02.875
of any kind of figurative object
we know at all.

49:02.987 --> 49:05.956
It's the earliest representation
of a human being,

49:06.056 --> 49:10.015
and it's the absolute root
of figurative depiction

49:10.127 --> 49:11.526
as we know it.

49:11.629 --> 49:14.530
Later on, we see a range
of animals being depicted.

49:14.632 --> 49:17.226
We can think of the animal
depictions in ivory here

49:17.334 --> 49:20.895
or the fabulous depictions
from Grotte Chauvet

49:21.005 --> 49:22.370
of mammoths, of lions,

49:22.473 --> 49:24.407
and we can see
a very clear connection

49:24.508 --> 49:28.501
between the Swabian finds
and the depictions in Chauvet.

49:28.612 --> 49:31.080
What's also fascinating
is that at this time,

49:31.181 --> 49:32.409
40,000 years ago,

49:32.516 --> 49:34.541
we see evidence
for musical instruments,

49:34.652 --> 49:36.142
a range of personal ornaments,

49:36.253 --> 49:38.414
mythical depictions
that clearly show

49:38.522 --> 49:41.013
that these people had
a religious concept

49:41.125 --> 49:45.221
evolving the transformation
between humans and animals.

49:45.329 --> 49:47.354
This here
is the original statuette

49:47.464 --> 49:50.297
carved from a mammoth tusk.

49:50.401 --> 49:53.700
- If we look at the Venus of
Hohle Fels a bit more closely,

49:53.804 --> 49:55.931
we can see very clearly,
for instance,

49:56.040 --> 49:58.474
that the figurine has no head,
right?

49:58.575 --> 50:00.907
Instead of a head,
the figurine has a ring.

50:01.011 --> 50:02.911
It was perhaps worn at times,

50:03.013 --> 50:05.811
suspended on a string
of some sort.

50:05.916 --> 50:08.316
Also, the sexual attributes
are key,

50:08.419 --> 50:10.785
which clearly link
this depiction

50:10.888 --> 50:14.255
to ideas of reproduction,
fecundity, sexuality,

50:14.358 --> 50:17.122
ideas that are
absolutely essential

50:17.227 --> 50:21.288
to all of humanity also today.

50:21.398 --> 50:23.366
It's also important to realize
that at this time,

50:23.467 --> 50:25.901
much of Europe was occupied
by Neanderthals.

50:26.003 --> 50:27.493
So we're dealing
with the critical phase

50:27.604 --> 50:28.969
in human evolution

50:29.073 --> 50:32.975
where two forms of human beings
are testing their boundaries.

50:33.077 --> 50:35.443
And what we find
over and over again

50:35.546 --> 50:36.535
is that Neanderthals,

50:36.647 --> 50:38.171
although they're
very sophisticated,

50:38.282 --> 50:44.414
they never had this kind
of symbolic artifact ever.

50:44.521 --> 50:46.648
This small ivory mammoth

50:46.757 --> 50:52.252
was also found
near Hohle Fels cave.

50:52.363 --> 50:57.892
And this beautiful horse
comes from the same region.

50:58.001 --> 51:00.936
They also found fragments
of flutes.

51:01.038 --> 51:04.769
We asked Dr. Conard
to show us an original.

51:04.875 --> 51:07.742
- The ivory flute is really
a remarkable artifact

51:07.845 --> 51:10.780
that Maria Malina discovered
a few years back,

51:10.881 --> 51:13.611
and I think
what's extremely important

51:13.717 --> 51:15.685
is that we realize
that archeology today

51:15.786 --> 51:19.085
is not a heroic adventure
with spades and picks

51:19.189 --> 51:21.555
but high-tech scientific work

51:21.658 --> 51:23.888
that's done
with incredible detail.

51:23.994 --> 51:26.895
Really millimeter by millimeter,
the sediments are removed

51:26.997 --> 51:29.830
in these deposits
the age of Grotte Chauvet

51:29.933 --> 51:31.093
and our sites,

51:31.201 --> 51:32.998
between 30,000
and 40,000 years ago.

51:33.103 --> 51:35.333
And this detailed work
allowed Maria

51:35.439 --> 51:37.805
to identify a whole range
of finds

51:37.908 --> 51:39.535
that she was able
to piece together.

51:39.643 --> 51:41.804
Maybe you can explain
how that worked out.

51:41.912 --> 51:43.846
- Yes, we were doing
an inventory

51:43.947 --> 51:45.539
of all the artifact pieces.

51:45.649 --> 51:48.812
Some of the pieces came
from the 1970s,

51:48.919 --> 51:50.750
from the first years
of excavation,

51:50.854 --> 51:53.550
and these were
really small pieces.

51:53.657 --> 51:55.887
You can see here
in this picture.

51:55.993 --> 51:57.620
The tiny ivory pieces

51:57.728 --> 52:01.164
remained unexplained
for a full three decades.

52:01.265 --> 52:07.067
- And 31 pieces had
a very significant look.

52:07.171 --> 52:11.130
We found pieces with a part
of the finger holes

52:11.241 --> 52:13.072
and with notches on the side,

52:13.177 --> 52:16.044
and with these pieces,
I thought already

52:16.146 --> 52:18.774
that it could be
a part of an ivory flute.

52:18.882 --> 52:21.112
Of course, the question
was very important

52:21.218 --> 52:23.049
how this flute was made.

52:23.153 --> 52:25.951
And you can see here
on the long axis

52:26.056 --> 52:29.958
there is a split
going all over the flute,

52:30.060 --> 52:34.554
and inside the two halves,
they hollowed the flute out.

52:34.665 --> 52:38.999
And these little notches
along this axis, along the split

52:39.102 --> 52:44.938
helped to refit these two halves
together very precise.

52:45.042 --> 52:47.636
This flute is only one
of eight in all

52:47.744 --> 52:52.238
so far recovered from this area
of southwestern Germany.

52:52.349 --> 52:54.476
The caves here
have no paintings

52:54.585 --> 52:57.850
but yield many other objects
of art.

52:57.955 --> 53:00.185
- In this cave,
the Geissenkloesterle cave,

53:00.290 --> 53:04.659
many very important findings
from the Ice Age were made.

53:04.761 --> 53:09.164
We found some little ivory
statues of bear and mammoth... -

53:09.266 --> 53:11.496
a very tiny mammoth,
very lovely.

53:11.602 --> 53:15.902
And in 1992, I was part
of the excavation team.

53:16.006 --> 53:21.034
People lived here about 30,000,
40,000 years back in time,

53:21.144 --> 53:23.442
and in that time,
it was very cold here,

53:23.547 --> 53:26.107
because the Alp Mountains
were covered by a glacier

53:26.216 --> 53:28.912
about 2,500 meters thick.

53:29.019 --> 53:30.850
And in the valley down there,

53:30.954 --> 53:33.821
reindeer and mammoth
were passing,

53:33.924 --> 53:35.653
and it was very cold.

53:35.759 --> 53:40.560
And that's the reason why
I'm dressed up like an Inuit.

53:40.664 --> 53:43.792
We presume that in this way,

53:43.901 --> 53:46.267
the people of the Ice Age
were clothed

53:46.370 --> 53:50.306
by reindeer fur
and boots made of reindeer fur

53:50.407 --> 53:51.840
and reindeer leather,

53:51.942 --> 53:57.437
because otherwise
you couldn't stand the cold.

53:57.548 --> 54:04.249
One of the most important finds
we made in this cave

54:04.354 --> 54:09.382
was a very tiny flute made
out of the radius of a vulture.

54:09.493 --> 54:13.793
Astonishing on this flute
is that is... -

54:13.897 --> 54:15.990
that it is pentatonic,

54:16.099 --> 54:21.935
and this is the same tonality
we are used to hear today.

54:22.039 --> 54:28.069
And if you like, I'll try to
play some small tunes for you.

54:43.126 --> 54:46.186
And when I first reconstructed
the instrument

54:46.296 --> 54:49.527
and tried to play some tunes,
I came across these ones.

55:07.551 --> 55:11.749
Sounds a little bit
like Star-Spangled Banner.

55:16.927 --> 55:20.988
Back in France,
near Chauvet Cave,

55:21.098 --> 55:24.192
explorers
using more primal techniques

55:24.301 --> 55:27.202
in search of still-hidden
underground chambers

55:27.304 --> 55:30.796
roam the landscape.

56:01.905 --> 56:03.805
Professional cave explorers

56:03.907 --> 56:07.206
have techniques for finding
underground chambers,

56:07.310 --> 56:08.971
because there are air currents.

56:09.079 --> 56:12.276
So they use the back
of their hands or their cheeks

56:12.382 --> 56:14.407
to feel for a faint draft of air

56:14.518 --> 56:19.217
that may be coming
out of the cave.

56:19.322 --> 56:21.586
I'm trying to do things
differently,

56:21.692 --> 56:27.756
as I have the habit of using my
sense of smell in my profession.

56:27.864 --> 56:29.525
So I try to sniff the smells

56:29.633 --> 56:35.367
coming from the interior
of a cave.

56:35.472 --> 56:40.671
Here, I didn't smell anything
except the exterior landscape.

56:40.777 --> 56:46.682
Outside you can smell the earth,
the wild thyme, the ivy.

56:46.783 --> 56:48.216
You can smell a range of things

56:48.318 --> 56:50.718
but nothing specific
related to a cavern

56:50.821 --> 56:54.052
that's been closed
for thousands of years.

56:58.929 --> 57:03.093
This is my personal technique,
because I design perfumes.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.792
It's a matter of trying
to experience it

57:04.901 --> 57:06.528
in a different manner.

57:06.636 --> 57:10.094
So I've been... - I've always
created perfumes,

57:10.207 --> 57:12.505
and most notably,
I was president

57:12.609 --> 57:14.770
of the French Society
of Perfumers

57:14.878 --> 57:18.507
for some years and...

57:40.737 --> 57:42.364
There are plans

57:42.472 --> 57:45.066
to build a theme park
for tourists

57:45.175 --> 57:47.439
with a precise replica
of the cave

57:47.544 --> 57:52.174
a few miles from here.

57:52.282 --> 57:55.376
This replica may even contain
a re-creation

57:55.485 --> 57:59.649
of the odor
of the prehistoric interior.

58:21.645 --> 58:24.170
- Evidently, the odor
you can smell right now

58:24.281 --> 58:26.681
is quite attenuated.

58:26.783 --> 58:29.411
It is very subtle.

58:29.519 --> 58:33.888
There are not many emanations,
but our imagination permits us

58:33.990 --> 58:37.756
to try and reconstruct
the scene,

58:37.861 --> 58:41.558
the scene with its odors
from 25,000 years ago,

58:41.665 --> 58:44.498
with all the animals that
would have been found there... -

58:44.601 --> 58:49.937
bears, wolves, perhaps even
rhinoceroses, and man... -

58:50.040 --> 58:54.875
the presence of their lives,
meaning burnt wood, resins,

58:54.978 --> 58:58.277
the odors of everything
from the natural world

58:58.381 --> 59:00.815
that surrounds this cave.

59:00.917 --> 59:04.580
We can go back
with our imagination.

59:11.595 --> 59:13.529
Herzog:
With his sense of wonder,

59:13.630 --> 59:15.257
the cave transforms

59:15.365 --> 59:18.926
into an enchanted world
of the imaginary

59:19.035 --> 59:24.473
where time and space
lose their meaning.

59:24.574 --> 59:29.204
These crystal formations take
thousands of years to grow.

59:29.312 --> 59:32.509
The artists of the cave
never even saw them,

59:32.616 --> 59:35.210
as many of them
only started to form

59:35.318 --> 59:39.220
after the landslide
sealed the entrance.

59:59.242 --> 01:00:02.006
In a forbidden recess
of the cave,

01:00:02.112 --> 01:00:04.910
there's a footprint
of an eight-year-old boy

01:00:05.015 --> 01:00:09.543
next to the footprint
of a wolf.

01:00:09.653 --> 01:00:13.054
Did a hungry wolf
stalk the boy?

01:00:13.156 --> 01:00:16.819
Or did they walk together
as friends?

01:00:16.927 --> 01:00:20.920
Or were their tracks made
thousands of years apart?

01:00:21.031 --> 01:00:24.467
We'll never know.

01:02:01.364 --> 01:02:03.662
Dwarfed
by these large chambers

01:02:03.767 --> 01:02:06.895
illuminated
by our wandering lights,

01:02:07.003 --> 01:02:11.633
sometimes we were overcome by
a strange, irrational sensation

01:02:11.741 --> 01:02:14.801
as if we were disturbing
the Paleolithic people

01:02:14.911 --> 01:02:17.846
in their work.

01:02:17.947 --> 01:02:22.543
It felt like eyes upon us.

01:02:22.652 --> 01:02:26.213
This sensation occurred
to some of the scientists

01:02:26.322 --> 01:02:31.316
and also the discoverers
of the cave.

01:02:31.428 --> 01:02:35.194
It was a relief to surface
again aboveground.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.192
Back outside,
we ask Jean-Michel Geneste

01:02:40.303 --> 01:02:43.500
about hunting techniques
of Paleolithic people

01:02:43.606 --> 01:02:47.838
millennia before the invention
of bow and arrow.

01:02:47.944 --> 01:02:51.971
- The Ohauvet Oave
Aurignacian people

01:02:52.082 --> 01:02:55.245
hunted a lot
of really big games.

01:02:55.351 --> 01:02:59.879
They hunted everywhere
in France and Europe.

01:02:59.989 --> 01:03:02.856
In the settlement,
we found a lot of bones

01:03:02.959 --> 01:03:07.794
of reindeer, bison, horses,
and sometime mammoths.

01:03:07.897 --> 01:03:12.266
So they developed very specific
hunting technology.

01:03:12.368 --> 01:03:16.634
For example, the system
of the Aurignacian bone point

01:03:16.739 --> 01:03:18.036
is very ingenious.

01:03:18.141 --> 01:03:21.838
It's a bone point
on a wooden shaft.

01:03:21.945 --> 01:03:24.573
The piece of the bone point

01:03:24.681 --> 01:03:28.549
is very strongly associated
to the shaft.

01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:33.384
It's a system using a fork
and a piece inside.

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:36.220
So it's very strong.

01:03:36.326 --> 01:03:38.157
It has been made and developed

01:03:38.261 --> 01:03:41.526
to kill bison or horses
like that.

01:03:41.631 --> 01:03:43.496
It's very aggressive,

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.364
and it's also very strong
and powerful.

01:03:46.469 --> 01:03:50.838
This kind of weapon and spear
were thrown

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:55.639
not only by hand, like that,
because it's not very efficient,

01:03:55.745 --> 01:03:58.612
but l... - we suspect that very... -

01:03:58.715 --> 01:04:01.707
in the beginning
of the Paleolithic,

01:04:01.818 --> 01:04:05.481
they developed the technology
of the spear thrower.

01:04:05.588 --> 01:04:09.581
A spear thrower, it's at
the beginning only a hook,

01:04:09.692 --> 01:04:12.661
sometime a tooth,
a piece of antler,

01:04:12.762 --> 01:04:15.458
like this one,
on a long handle.

01:04:15.565 --> 01:04:21.629
It's elongated arm gave
a lot of power, like that,

01:04:21.738 --> 01:04:25.037
and also at the same time,
some precision to keep... -

01:04:25.141 --> 01:04:27.609
I just... - to give the spear
a good direction.

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:29.803
So I will show you.

01:04:29.913 --> 01:04:33.007
Yes.

01:04:33.116 --> 01:04:36.574
You see, the spear
with a flint point,

01:04:36.686 --> 01:04:40.144
but to use this,
it's necessary to have

01:04:40.256 --> 01:04:44.886
a small depression
at the back of the spear.

01:04:44.994 --> 01:04:50.330
We suspect that sometimes
they used feathers to a very... -

01:04:50.433 --> 01:04:53.266
to keep the direction
at the moment of the throw.

01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:58.432
I will try to show you
how to kill a horse.

01:05:01.044 --> 01:05:03.342
Okay.

01:05:03.446 --> 01:05:07.576
His efforts
may not look very convincing,

01:05:07.684 --> 01:05:10.152
but this is a powerful weapon.

01:05:10.253 --> 01:05:13.711
Spearheads have been found
deeply embedded

01:05:13.823 --> 01:05:17.987
in the shoulder blades
of horses and mammoths.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.399
- You see the fly?

01:05:25.501 --> 01:05:29.494
It's very straight,
and it's 30 meters.

01:05:29.606 --> 01:05:31.301
But stay here.

01:05:31.407 --> 01:05:35.571
The Paleolithic man
was better than you, I guess.

01:05:35.678 --> 01:05:37.111
- Oh, I suspect.

01:05:37.213 --> 01:05:39.579
It could be
really difficult for me

01:05:39.682 --> 01:05:44.710
with such a shot
to kill a horse, really.

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:48.287
By mid-April,

01:05:48.391 --> 01:05:51.883
scientific research has ended
for the year.

01:05:51.995 --> 01:05:56.557
Now we are allowed full access
to the cave,

01:05:56.666 --> 01:05:58.759
but even that is restricted

01:05:58.868 --> 01:06:03.134
to a single week,
four hours a day.

01:06:03.239 --> 01:06:06.333
The famous cave of Lascaux
had to be shut down

01:06:06.442 --> 01:06:09.343
because the breath
of scores of tourists

01:06:09.445 --> 01:06:14.041
has caused mold to grow
on the walls.

01:06:20.023 --> 01:06:21.615
We enter Chauvet Cave

01:06:21.724 --> 01:06:25.854
aware that this may be
the only and last opportunity

01:06:25.962 --> 01:06:28.931
to film inside.

01:07:33.296 --> 01:07:37.460
The mystery of the Minotaur
and the female began to unfold

01:07:37.567 --> 01:07:40.559
when our guides allowed us
to mount a small camera

01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:46.438
on a stick
with which we reached out.

01:07:46.542 --> 01:07:51.639
The bison seems to embrace
the sex of a naked woman.

01:07:58.054 --> 01:08:00.488
- Traditional people
and, I think,

01:08:00.590 --> 01:08:04.424
people of the Paleolithic
had very probably some... -

01:08:04.527 --> 01:08:09.157
two concepts which change
our vision of the world.

01:08:09.265 --> 01:08:13.725
They're the concept of fluidity
and the concept of permeability.

01:08:13.836 --> 01:08:17.863
Fluidity means that
the categories that we have... -

01:08:17.974 --> 01:08:22.434
man, woman, horse, I don't know,
tree, et cetera... -

01:08:22.545 --> 01:08:24.308
can shift.

01:08:24.413 --> 01:08:26.381
A tree may speak.

01:08:26.482 --> 01:08:29.314
A man can get transformed
into an animal

01:08:29.419 --> 01:08:33.981
and the other way around,
given certain circumstances.

01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:40.426
The concept of permeability
is that there are no barriers,

01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:42.964
so to speak,
between the world where we are

01:08:43.064 --> 01:08:45.295
and the world of the spirits.

01:08:45.401 --> 01:08:48.495
A wall can talk to us,

01:08:48.604 --> 01:08:53.268
or a wall can accept us
or refuse us.

01:08:53.376 --> 01:08:56.538
A shaman, for example,
can send his or her spirit

01:08:56.645 --> 01:08:59.171
to the world
of the supernatural

01:08:59.282 --> 01:09:03.514
or can receive the visit,
inside him or her,

01:09:03.618 --> 01:09:05.951
of supernatural spirits.

01:09:06.055 --> 01:09:08.751
If you put those two concepts
together,

01:09:08.858 --> 01:09:12.953
you realize how different
life must have been

01:09:13.062 --> 01:09:17.055
for those people
from the way we live now.

01:09:19.836 --> 01:09:22.497
Humans have been described
in many ways, right?

01:09:22.604 --> 01:09:25.971
And for a while,
it was Homo sapiens

01:09:26.075 --> 01:09:28.167
and is still called
Homo sapiens,

01:09:28.277 --> 01:09:30.108
"the man who knows."

01:09:30.212 --> 01:09:33.841
I don't think
it's a good definition at all.

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:35.314
We don't know.

01:09:35.417 --> 01:09:36.715
We don't know much.

01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:41.051
I would think Homo spiritualis.

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.822
The strongest hint
of something spiritual,

01:09:46.929 --> 01:09:49.591
some religious ceremony
in the cave,

01:09:49.698 --> 01:09:51.758
is this bear skull.

01:09:51.868 --> 01:09:58.103
It has been placed dead center
on a rock resembling an altar.

01:09:58.207 --> 01:10:02.007
The staging seems deliberate.

01:10:02.111 --> 01:10:05.478
The skull faces the entrance
of the cave,

01:10:05.581 --> 01:10:09.017
and around it, fragments
of charcoal were found

01:10:09.118 --> 01:10:13.077
potentially used as incense.

01:10:17.293 --> 01:10:19.261
What exactly took place here,

01:10:19.362 --> 01:10:22.695
only the paintings
could tell us.

01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:17.628
- If you want to have
an understanding of it,

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.538
you must go outside of the cave.

01:13:20.643 --> 01:13:25.637
I mean, you must start from
the cave and then go outside.

01:13:25.748 --> 01:13:26.874
How far outside?

01:13:26.982 --> 01:13:28.279
Where would you go?

01:13:28.384 --> 01:13:32.184
- Well, I would say everywhere
but with... -

01:13:32.288 --> 01:13:34.483
to have a look
at different culture

01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:37.559
would be a very good way
to better understand

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:41.687
how different culture
could have coped with rock art,

01:13:41.797 --> 01:13:44.994
for example, in Australia,
in North America,

01:13:45.101 --> 01:13:46.625
or in South Africa.

01:13:46.736 --> 01:13:48.863
Aborigines in Australia

01:13:48.971 --> 01:13:54.136
who lived until recently
almost like Stone Age people.

01:13:54.243 --> 01:13:58.646
- Sure, for example,
because they used to paint

01:13:58.748 --> 01:14:02.809
and to create rock art
until the 1970s,

01:14:02.918 --> 01:14:05.284
and in some places,
I think there still are

01:14:05.387 --> 01:14:08.413
some traditions
of creating rock art.

01:14:08.524 --> 01:14:10.082
Well, of course it has changed

01:14:10.192 --> 01:14:12.490
since the beginning
of the century,

01:14:12.595 --> 01:14:14.426
when they were discovered,

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:18.296
but it can tell us
different ways

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.833
of looking at rock art

01:14:19.935 --> 01:14:22.460
which are not our way
of looking at rock art.

01:14:22.571 --> 01:14:24.061
Do you have an example?

01:14:24.173 --> 01:14:25.697
- Yeah, sure, of course.

01:14:25.808 --> 01:14:31.610
In north Australia, for example,
in the 1970s,

01:14:31.714 --> 01:14:35.309
an ethnographer was on the field
with an aborigine

01:14:35.417 --> 01:14:37.351
who was his informer,

01:14:37.453 --> 01:14:40.911
and once they arrived
in a rock shelter.

01:14:41.023 --> 01:14:42.285
And in that rock shelter,

01:14:42.391 --> 01:14:44.951
there were some
beautiful paintings,

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:46.493
but they were decaying.

01:14:46.595 --> 01:14:50.190
And the aborigine
started to become sad

01:14:50.299 --> 01:14:52.563
because he saw
the paintings decaying.

01:14:52.668 --> 01:14:54.932
And in that region,
there is a tradition

01:14:55.037 --> 01:14:59.133
of touching up the paintings
time after time,

01:14:59.241 --> 01:15:06.044
so he sat, and he started
to touch up the paintings.

01:15:06.148 --> 01:15:10.175
So the ethnographer
asked the question

01:15:10.286 --> 01:15:14.382
that every Western person
would have asked.

01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:16.390
"Why are you painting?"

01:15:16.492 --> 01:15:18.426
And the man answered,

01:15:18.527 --> 01:15:22.486
and his answer
is very troubling,

01:15:22.598 --> 01:15:24.725
because he answered,
"I am not.

01:15:24.834 --> 01:15:26.893
"I am not painting.

01:15:27.002 --> 01:15:30.438
"That's the hand, only hand,

01:15:30.539 --> 01:15:33.838
spirit who is actually
painting now."

01:15:33.943 --> 01:15:35.672
The hand of a spirit.

01:15:35.778 --> 01:15:40.943
- Yeah, because the man
is a part of the spirit.

01:22:59.221 --> 01:23:02.782
Do you think that
the paintings in Chauvet Cave

01:23:02.891 --> 01:23:07.294
were somehow the beginning
of the modern human soul?

01:23:07.396 --> 01:23:09.557
What constitutes humanness?

01:23:09.665 --> 01:23:15.570
- Humanness
is a very good adaptation

01:23:15.671 --> 01:23:18.139
with the... - in the world.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.334
So the soc... -
the human society

01:23:21.443 --> 01:23:24.810
needs to adaptate
to the landscape,

01:23:24.913 --> 01:23:28.349
to the other beings,
the animals,

01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:31.783
to other human groups

01:23:31.887 --> 01:23:35.948
and to communicate something,
to communicate it

01:23:36.058 --> 01:23:38.618
and to inscribe the memory

01:23:38.727 --> 01:23:43.061
on very specific
and hard things,

01:23:43.165 --> 01:23:48.000
like walls, like pieces of wood,
like bones,

01:23:48.103 --> 01:23:51.664
this is invention
of Cro-Magnon.

01:23:51.773 --> 01:23:53.172
And how about music?

01:23:53.275 --> 01:23:57.473
- And... - yes, and also things,
mythology, music.

01:23:57.579 --> 01:24:02.039
But with the invention
of the figuration... -

01:24:02.150 --> 01:24:05.051
figuration of animals, of men,
of things... -

01:24:05.153 --> 01:24:08.520
it's a way of communication
between humans

01:24:08.623 --> 01:24:10.488
and with the future

01:24:10.592 --> 01:24:14.926
to evocate the past,
to transmit information

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:18.397
that is very better
than language,

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.628
than oral communication.

01:24:21.737 --> 01:24:27.471
And this invention is still
the same in our world today... -

01:24:27.576 --> 01:24:30.511
with this camera, for example.

01:24:54.803 --> 01:24:56.566
On the Rhone River

01:24:56.671 --> 01:25:01.005
is one of the largest nuclear
power plants in France.

01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:05.910
The Chauvet Cave is located
only 20 miles as the crow flies

01:25:06.014 --> 01:25:09.313
beyond these hills
in the background.

01:25:09.418 --> 01:25:11.909
A surplus of warm water,

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:14.921
which has been used
to cool these reactors,

01:25:15.023 --> 01:25:21.053
is diverted half a mile away
to create a tropical biosphere.

01:25:21.163 --> 01:25:24.997
Warm steam
fills enormous greenhouses,

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.762
and the site is expanding.

01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:52.524
Crocodiles have been introduced
into this brooding jungle,

01:25:52.627 --> 01:25:55.721
and warmed by water
to cool the reactor,

01:25:55.831 --> 01:25:59.426
man, do they thrive.

01:25:59.534 --> 01:26:03.402
There are already
hundreds of them.

01:26:11.813 --> 01:26:13.576
Not surprisingly,

01:26:13.682 --> 01:26:19.279
mutant albinos swim and breed
in these waters.

01:26:19.387 --> 01:26:23.687
A thought is born
of this surreal environment.

01:26:23.792 --> 01:26:27.888
Not long ago, just a few
ten thousands of years back,

01:26:27.996 --> 01:26:32.626
there were glaciers here
9,000 feet thick.

01:26:32.734 --> 01:26:36.670
And now a new climate
is steaming and spreading.

01:26:39.307 --> 01:26:44.643
Fairly soon, these albinos
might reach Chauvet Cave.

01:26:44.746 --> 01:26:50.480
Looking at the paintings,
what will they make of them?

01:27:04.132 --> 01:27:05.724
Nothing is real.

01:27:05.834 --> 01:27:08.359
Nothing is certain.

01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:11.530
It is hard to decide
whether or not

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.608
these creatures here
are dividing

01:27:13.708 --> 01:27:17.337
into their own doppelgaengers.

01:27:19.414 --> 01:27:22.713
And do they really meet,

01:27:22.817 --> 01:27:27.720
or is it just their own
imaginary mirror reflection?

01:27:32.861 --> 01:27:36.058
Are we today
possibly the crocodiles

01:27:36.164 --> 01:27:38.894
who look back into an abyss
of time

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.096
when we see the paintings
of Chauvet Cave?
