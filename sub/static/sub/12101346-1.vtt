The process of moving a novel
from the page to the screen

00:14.139 --> 00:16.015
is one, essentially, of transformation.

00:16.099 --> 00:21.980
What you're trying to do is articulate the
theme of the novel as much as the plot.

00:22.064 --> 00:25.734
-No phones.
-This is some Jim Jones bullshit!

00:26.568 --> 00:29.863
I think I've read everything
Paul Theroux's written.

00:29.947 --> 00:34.535
And he's been
an incredibly important voice in my life.

00:34.618 --> 00:38.705
In my own prose writing I kind of
try to borrow his timbre, his tone.

00:38.789 --> 00:43.252
So I was excited to set about
the process of how you would adapt

00:43.335 --> 00:45.838
that extant text into a television show.

00:47.256 --> 00:50.342
I'm delighted, actually,
to see that someone took the book,

00:50.425 --> 00:52.970
in this case Neil Cross, and he's saying,

00:53.053 --> 00:55.347
"I wanna preserve the spirit of this book.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.976
The same Allie, the same Charlie,
but 40 years later."

00:59.601 --> 01:04.022
Computers, circuit boards, SIM card ports.
There's gold in all of that.

01:04.605 --> 01:08.068
I saw Neil's work immediately
in the way that I could make it.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.320
I saw where the camera would go.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.948
He came into scenes
where I would wanna come into a scene.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.951
He's a really
visual cinematic storyteller.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.120
Rupert really set the tone,

01:18.203 --> 01:22.332
sort of that poetic cinematic look
for the first couple of episodes.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.460
He did this incredible

01:25.544 --> 01:28.422
flying shot that just keeps
going and going and going,

01:28.505 --> 01:31.466
and you just see all this action unfold
and then it ends up on Allie.

01:31.550 --> 01:32.843
It's just beautiful.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.846
He saw my hair,

01:35.929 --> 01:37.848
and it was chopped too perfectly.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.392
He said, "We need to make your
hair look like your mom does it."

01:40.475 --> 01:42.311
Why are you doing this to us?

01:42.394 --> 01:45.856
What we're seeing is a family
that has secrets,

01:45.939 --> 01:52.154
and has problems, but instead of
leaning further into that family drama...

01:52.237 --> 01:53.530
we explode it.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.200
And the show thereafter is,

01:56.283 --> 02:00.704
"Where do they go now?
What do they do? How do they manage it?"
