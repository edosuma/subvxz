I'm not talking to you.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.641
I didn't say anything.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.477
[exhales] Well, I just wanted you to know.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.686
Duly noted.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.104
Yeah, to either of you.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.857
Now, hold on. If you're beefing with me,
that's one thing--

01:05.940 --> 01:08.526
-Beefing?
-But she's got nothing to do with this.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.278
-Leave her out of it.
-[scoffs]

01:10.361 --> 01:11.321
Really?

01:12.238 --> 01:13.406
Tell me then, Frankie.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.992
What do you think went wrong
with the <i>Shark Tank </i>audition?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.536
-You totally beefed it.
-[scoffs] Beefed it?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.997
-You froze up! I had to carry both of us.
-Oh.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.041
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

01:23.124 --> 01:26.419
You went into the entire history of why
the dummy has a bullet hole in its head

01:26.503 --> 01:28.463
and how I almost shot our friendship. God.

01:28.546 --> 01:31.257
I mean, why the hell did you have
to bring the dummy, anyway?

01:31.341 --> 01:33.384
It was a visual aide.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.762
Who else
was going to sit on the Rise Up?

01:35.845 --> 01:37.555
Oh, I don't know, how about you?

01:37.639 --> 01:39.265
I didn't have to go.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.392
The dummy took over the entire pitch.

01:41.476 --> 01:44.604
By the time they got around to asking
why there was a toilet underneath it,

01:44.687 --> 01:45.897
our time was up.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.774
So, what do you want me to say to them,

01:47.857 --> 01:50.944
"Shut up now so we can tell you
about this toilet?"

01:51.027 --> 01:52.612
You did say that!

Hey, I just refilled my prescription.
Would you care for a chill pill?

02:12.257 --> 02:14.050
Or are you gonna be pouting all day?

02:14.134 --> 02:17.053
Oh, Frankie, between the mess
at Desert Topaz

02:17.137 --> 02:21.141
and our four-hour flat tire adventure,
I need a day off.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.977
From Rise Up, from you, from all of it.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.688
Well, I need a break from you, too.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.860
So, you want to get lunch--?

02:33.111 --> 02:35.697
Oh, wait! You've got my dummy!

02:39.617 --> 02:42.036
Oh, good, you're here.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.664
I could use a nice hang sesh.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.584
I'll order Chinese, you fire up the Xbox.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.877
No, Frankie.

02:49.752 --> 02:50.879
We need to talk.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.673
I-I'm not tied to Chinese.
We can get whatever.

02:53.756 --> 02:57.010
Though, I prefer Chinese. Chinese?

02:57.427 --> 02:58.845
Please, sit.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.638
It's important.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.228
I'm here to...

03:08.188 --> 03:09.564
Oh, this is so hard.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.693
My visa expires in two days.

03:14.652 --> 03:18.114
I can't stay in the country
legally anymore. I'm...

03:18.990 --> 03:20.450
I'm here to say goodbye.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.494
Wait, what?
Y-You're going back to England?

03:23.578 --> 03:24.829
Back to the rain...

03:25.496 --> 03:28.541
and all those questions
about the curious circumstances

03:28.625 --> 03:31.878
surrounding the poisoning death
of my ex-husband?

03:33.504 --> 03:34.797
Yes, I'm going back to England.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.217
No, no, this can't be happening.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.054
How could you let it go so far
without telling us?

03:41.137 --> 03:42.513
I'm sorry, dear.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.016
I didn't think this would happen, either.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.143
I had a plan.

03:47.227 --> 03:52.148
Some months ago,
I ensnared a gentleman citizen named Gus.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.109
-You're talking green card marriage?
-Big time.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.321
-But he died last night.
-Not Gus.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.573
I know. It's awful.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.533
He had everything you'd want.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.285

04:08.331 --> 04:11.459

04:11.834 --> 04:13.962
You were gonna pay him $10,000?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.130
I've got some money on the street.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.675
We need to find you a husband.

04:18.758 --> 04:23.096
Where on earth could we possibly find
a single man my age

04:23.179 --> 04:26.933
who's desperate enough
to marry a stranger in two days?

04:27.475 --> 04:29.811
Oh, I think that can be arranged.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.229
Oh.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.899
I don't know why I said it like that.
I don't have a plan.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.655
[Mallory] Oh, thank God.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.991
I needed a Mallory day so badly.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.618
Madison's been displaying
early signs of pretty troubling--

04:45.702 --> 04:48.579
You know, when I was a mom,
it was considered impolite

04:48.663 --> 04:51.791
to bring up your children
during a massage.

04:52.458 --> 04:56.337
-Wow, cannot picture you as a mom.
-[Mallory snorts]

04:56.754 --> 04:59.090

with Frankie.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.342
-[scoffs]
-Speaking of, where is the little dickens?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.386
I said no children today.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.388
And no business talk.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.973
Today is about me.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.226
-To a lesser extent, you.
-Fine by me.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.730
I can talk non-business stuff
with my mother and sister.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.942

-[Mallory clears throat]

05:18.234 --> 05:19.068

05:19.610 --> 05:21.154

-Yes!
-Music. Great.

05:28.536 --> 05:29.996
[Mallory] Aw, that's so sweet.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.998
They're using Say Grace lotion.

05:32.957 --> 05:36.002
-I'm actually Grace.
-[Brianna chuckles]

05:36.085 --> 05:37.253
But I guess you knew that.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.006
Oh, uh, this isn't Say Grace lotion.

05:40.089 --> 05:44.302
[scoffs] I think I would recognize
the smell of Beach Rose. I created it.

05:44.802 --> 05:48.848

from, uh, Trust Us Organics. See?

05:53.019 --> 05:54.979
-What the fuck?
-They stole Beach Rose?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.773
No, no one stole anything.

Guys, guys,
let's not ruin this day for me.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.777
Mallory is right,
we should sue the bastards.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.488
That is our proprietary scent.

We're not gonna take this lying down.
Everybody up!

06:07.742 --> 06:11.287

and get these massages.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.499
No! No. Spa day is canceled.
Mallory, call our lawyer.

06:16.667 --> 06:19.087
So, uh, do you need to go?

06:19.170 --> 06:20.588
Yeah, yeah. In an hour.

with all her hair and ten grand.
[chuckles]

06:41.359 --> 06:43.111
I don't know about this, Frankie.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.695

Welcome. Welcome, all. Come in, come in.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.884
Have a drink, have two,
make yourselves comfortable.

07:07.343 --> 07:10.179
And for the love of God, don't be afraid
to open those wallets.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.431
We have a theater to save.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.682
Remember,

07:12.765 --> 07:18.187
the future of San Diego gay community
theater ages 50-plus itself is at stake.

-How are we looking?
-[nervous groans]

07:44.255 --> 07:46.299
Yeah, it's pretty grim so far.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.885
Who would have thought
a bunch of community theater actors

07:48.968 --> 07:50.678
would be such cheapskates?

07:50.761 --> 07:52.138
Excuse me, won't you?

07:59.770 --> 08:01.147
We have a big problem.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.900
I know. Nobody's eating the canapés.

08:03.983 --> 08:08.196
You promised me I would recoup my money
at this fundraiser.

08:08.279 --> 08:12.867

out a check for $20,000 to the theater,

-he's going to kill me.
-But Robert,

to save my marriage.

This is all making me
a little uncomfortable, Frankie.

That's the beauty of speed dating, baby.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.447
Nobody's comfortable.

-Shall we begin?
-[whispers] Okay.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.379
It's nice to meet you, Mel.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.549
Let's see. Do you like to dance?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.217
I love to dance.

09:11.300 --> 09:15.263
Before my wife passed,
we always danced to Johnny Mathis.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.181
-[slight chuckle]
-I miss it.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.975
Yeah, yeah, dancing's great.

09:19.308 --> 09:23.229
Do you have a problem
lying to the United States government?

09:23.312 --> 09:26.232
-Come again?
-Lies. Big ones.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.860
-You game?
-I never lied in my life.

[sighs, clicks tongue]

09:34.407 --> 09:36.242
[timer clicking]

09:36.867 --> 09:40.329
Are you currently in any jams
that ten grand could fix?

09:41.706 --> 09:43.583
Have you ever perjured yourself?

09:44.333 --> 09:47.295
Are you willing to learn
absolutely everything

09:47.378 --> 09:49.213
about the goddess to my left

09:49.297 --> 09:55.261
in order to defraud the country
you so bravely fought for at Iwo Jima?

09:55.344 --> 09:56.887
[snoring]

09:57.471 --> 10:01.267
And that was the third time
I saw Matthew Broderick naked.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.102
Mm-mm.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.442
So, obviously, this isn't
an official deposition.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.319
I just need to hear
your version of events.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.987
How do you know the scent was stolen?

10:13.070 --> 10:14.780
-[Brianna scoffs]
-How do I know? I--

10:14.864 --> 10:16.198
I created it, that's how.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.742
That's right. You tell her, Mom.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.827
-Yeah, it all started back in--
-Start telling the story.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.747
Well, I--
Would you calm down? I'm telling it.

10:22.830 --> 10:26.626
The year was... 1999.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.754
I was having a relaxing weekend getaway

10:29.837 --> 10:32.840
at the Hotel Del Coronado
without my family.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.258
It was Mother's Day.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.552
You spent Mother's Day
without your family?

10:36.636 --> 10:40.556
It's called Mother's Day,
not "Spend Time With Your Kids" Day.

10:41.724 --> 10:45.436
<i>I was sitting on the beach patio deck,</i>
<i>looking out over the water.</i>

10:45.728 --> 10:49.273
<i>This was my... my sanctuary,</i>
<i>my place of peace,</i>

10:49.815 --> 10:51.150
<i>of meditation.</i>

10:51.901 --> 10:56.781
<i>I was on my seventh margarita,</i>
<i>so I was starting to feel a slight buzz.</i>

10:56.864 --> 10:59.283
<i>See, I don't normally drink tequila.</i>

10:59.742 --> 11:02.161
<i>Oh, a crisp sea wind washed over me</i>

11:02.244 --> 11:06.957
<i>and brought with it the aroma</i>
<i>of beach roses and oleander.</i>

11:07.041 --> 11:11.712
<i>It was a combination that mixed sweetly</i>
<i>with the lime from my Cabo Wabo shot,</i>

11:11.796 --> 11:16.717
<i>creating a heady mélange</i>
<i>that became the basis for Grace Number 5,</i>

11:16.801 --> 11:18.344
<i>more commonly known as...</i>

11:21.013 --> 11:22.056
Okay.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.558
That is shockingly detailed,

you imbibed.

-Thank you.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.981
Where the hell have you been?

11:31.065 --> 11:33.567
I went to the Del Coronado
to sniff around.

11:33.651 --> 11:36.570
So I had a few drinks.
And then I had a few more.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.364
Yeah, sure. I've been there.

11:38.447 --> 11:41.951
Obviously, I couldn't drive,
so I crashed for a few hours.

11:42.034 --> 11:46.122
And when I woke up in my hotel room,
I smelled Beach Rose.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.873
[whispers] Everywhere.

11:47.957 --> 11:51.877
[normal voice] It was all over the sheets,
the pillows. Everything.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.588
Well, well, how can that be possible?

11:55.256 --> 11:58.843
[exhales] Because Beach Rose
is actually Sea Mist,

11:58.926 --> 12:00.469

has been making for decades.

I... I don't understand.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.519
If it's a linen spray,
how did you smell it outside?

We all really need to start drinking less.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.583
I stole their smell.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.335
The good news is we figured this out
before we tried to sue them.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.671
I say let sleeping dogs lie.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.923
Their CEO is very litigious.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.469

It's Taneth Fairlight

13:30.893 --> 13:34.104
was leave a rather threatening voice mail
for Taneth.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.439
[Mallory] What did you say?

13:36.273 --> 13:38.025
Something non-specific, I hope?

Let's see, um...

I'm gonna shove that lawsuit

It was a valiant effort.

22:21.923 --> 22:25.218
But it would mean no more worrying
about overhead and payroll.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.720
-And Grace...
-Uh-huh?

22:26.803 --> 22:28.221
We have meetings every week.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.266
-Excuse me?
-AA meetings.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.227
And I would be honored
to be your sponsor.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.104
What do you say?

22:41.693 --> 22:43.612
-Can we talk it over?
-Yeah.

22:43.695 --> 22:44.613
-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

22:44.696 --> 22:45.947
Yeah. Take a second.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.953
-Okay.
-Guys, hey, quick gut check.

22:52.037 --> 22:52.913
Are we alcoholics?

22:52.996 --> 22:55.290
-[together] No, no, no, no.
-I mean, Mom might be.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.418
-[Grace exhales]
-All right, what the hell do we do here?

22:58.502 --> 23:02.631
Uh, look, I know I got you into this mess,
and I'll support whatever you want to do,

23:02.714 --> 23:03.799
but... [exhales]

23:03.882 --> 23:06.635
I truly believe that if you do this...

23:07.594 --> 23:10.138
[whispers] ...that woman
is gonna make me go to AA.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.640
Yes, I know.

23:11.973 --> 23:15.519
And as hilarious as that would be,
I still don't want to sell my company.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.687
Oh, thank God. Oh.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.481
I mean, if that's what you want to do.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.317
Okay, but if we don't sell,
she's going to sue us.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.485
No doubt.

23:24.611 --> 23:27.489
But I think the Hanson women should
stick together and fight this thing.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.949
Damn straight.

23:36.915 --> 23:40.752
Bruno, as much as it pains me,
I have to thank you.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.921
You're really helping us out
in a jam here.

23:43.004 --> 23:45.048
Are you kidding? This is great.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.884
Please, keep me in mind for future crimes.

23:49.094 --> 23:52.222
I know this sounds crazy,
but I have butterflies.

23:52.305 --> 23:55.392
Oh, what a coincidence,
Bruno smells like mothballs.

23:55.475 --> 23:58.061
Please, I'm getting married.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.105
To a prince, no less.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.524
It's a big deal, even if it is a con.

24:02.607 --> 24:06.319
If I'd known it was my wedding day,
I-I would have stolen a comb.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.114
[chuckles] Here. Let's look at you. Oh.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.048
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.385
What? No. Why?

24:30.469 --> 24:32.095
I-I just can't do this.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.889
Oh, what? You want more money?

24:33.972 --> 24:35.515
No, it's not the money.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.976
It's just that I broke my number one rule.

24:38.977 --> 24:43.273
"Don't get attached to anything
you're not willing to walk out on

24:43.356 --> 24:45.108
in 30 seconds flat

24:45.817 --> 24:48.445
if you feel the heat around the corner."

24:48.528 --> 24:51.072
That's beautifully put. Where's it from?

24:51.156 --> 24:52.324
I just made it up.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.242
That is definitely from <i>Heat.</i>

24:54.910 --> 24:56.703
[Bruno] You're a very special lady.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.915
And if I was gonna do
something like this with you,

24:59.998 --> 25:01.625
I'd want it to be for real.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.253
Look me up if you work it out
to stick around.

25:06.129 --> 25:10.800
Frankie, I know we've had our differences,
but I really think I should get paid.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.177
Get out of here!

25:13.762 --> 25:15.013
-[suspenders snap]
-[soft grunt]

25:18.225 --> 25:20.435
Well, what do we do now?

25:20.519 --> 25:23.271
Oh, sweetie, you know what we're gonna do.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.149
-Oh.
-Joan-Margaret,

25:26.233 --> 25:29.986
would you make me
the happiest fraud in San Diego?

25:30.070 --> 25:32.072
[chuckles] Oh, Frankie, yes.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.449
-[laughs]
-A thousand times yes.

25:35.659 --> 25:36.493
Oh!

25:36.576 --> 25:38.119
Hey, but we still need a witness.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.871
Oh, I've got that covered.

25:39.955 --> 25:43.083
Are you ready to go in there
and show this lady what's what?

25:43.166 --> 25:44.918
-Yeah. I mean, how tough could she be?
-Yeah.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.253
She's just a two-bit wino.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.296
-Mallory, my God.
-Jesus, Mal.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.382
What? I was joking.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.384
Why is it funny
when you guys say stuff like that?

25:52.467 --> 25:53.843
-[exhales]
-[phone chimes]

25:57.264 --> 25:58.515
Oh, wait.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.225
-I gotta go.
-What?

26:00.308 --> 26:02.269
Frankie confused LOL with SOS again,

26:02.352 --> 26:05.438
and I've been friends with her long enough
to know when she's in trouble.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.982
Y-You can handle this, right?

26:07.065 --> 26:08.858
Yeah. She's a two-bit wino.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.527
[slight chuckle] Now that's funny.

26:14.948 --> 26:15.782
Taneth.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.829
So, we've put a lot of thought
into your proposal.

26:21.371 --> 26:25.500
But, at the end of the day,
this company...

26:25.875 --> 26:26.793
is my baby.

26:27.252 --> 26:31.047
It's my mother's legacy.
It's my sister's... hobby.

26:31.798 --> 26:35.218
-It's not just a company, and we can't--
-This is my offer.

26:35.844 --> 26:36.928
Sold.

26:43.351 --> 26:44.686
Oh! Uh, Frankie!

26:44.769 --> 26:47.272
Oh, you came! You really came!

26:47.355 --> 26:50.400
[breathless] I've been calling you nonstop
for 30 minutes.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.694
Huh. So you have. What's up?

26:52.777 --> 26:54.988
What's up? I leave you alone
for one afternoon

26:55.071 --> 26:56.573
and you're getting married?

26:56.656 --> 26:57.991
To Joan-Margaret?

26:58.074 --> 27:00.285
Hey, I'm a catch.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.203
[Frankie] Her visa is expiring.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.497
She's gonna be deported
if we don't get married.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.041
Just calm down, okay?

27:06.124 --> 27:08.960
First of all, Joan-Margaret
is our employee.

27:09.044 --> 27:12.047
We fill out two forms,
and she stays in the country.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.715
It's called a work visa.

27:14.382 --> 27:15.467
And what's second of all?

27:17.177 --> 27:18.511
You're missing the point.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.097
Cool, cool, cool. Work visa.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.599
[gasps] Oh!

27:22.682 --> 27:24.976
Like I used to fill out
with Robert and Sol.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.854
Oh, my God. You know what?
You two deserve each other.

27:28.355 --> 27:31.441
Oh, wait. I...
I don't know how to get home.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.444
Not too fast.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.447
Can you believe it, Robert?

27:37.864 --> 27:41.409
Really instills your faith
in humanity, huh?

27:41.493 --> 27:44.788
People coming together for a good cause.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.665
Terrific. Just terrific.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.124
So good.

27:48.541 --> 27:51.127
-What's wrong?
-The fundraiser was a flop, Sol.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.506
And, of course, I'm glad for Sidney,
but the theater made almost nothing.

27:54.589 --> 27:57.175
Honey, if there's one thing
I learned today,

27:57.717 --> 28:00.720
it's if you give people a chance
to be heroes,

28:00.804 --> 28:02.472
they'll rise to the occasion.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.683
I know we'll find a way.

28:06.267 --> 28:07.268
Well...

28:07.852 --> 28:08.978
maybe you're right.

28:09.729 --> 28:10.897
And maybe...

28:11.773 --> 28:13.274
charity starts at home.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.027
-What do you mean?
-Oh, Sol...

28:16.111 --> 28:18.488
what you did today for Sidney inspired me.

28:18.571 --> 28:19.572
What if...

28:19.989 --> 28:23.535
what if we were the ones
to save the New Lear?

28:23.952 --> 28:25.870
We've got some extra money put away.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.956
What do we need with 20,000...

28:28.581 --> 28:31.126
when it can go to the people
who deserve it most?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.962
Let's do it, you and me, Sol.

28:34.754 --> 28:35.755
What do you say?

28:40.885 --> 28:42.762
Absolutely not.

28:48.977 --> 28:52.188
Oh, thank you, Grace, for coming
all the way down to City Hall,

28:52.272 --> 28:54.190
even though it was for nothing.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.736
And I'm sorry that I went rogue
at Desert Topaz.

28:57.819 --> 29:02.699
Forget it. You know, you made a mistake.
It happens to the best of us, believe me.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.159
-Come here.
-[chuckles]

29:04.659 --> 29:05.493
Mmm.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.911
-[phone chimes]
-[Grace] Oh!

29:08.371 --> 29:09.414
E-mail.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.792
-It's from <i>Shark Tank.</i>
-Oh.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.754
Well, they say
they've been calling you all day.

29:17.672 --> 29:19.716
So they have. What's up?

29:21.593 --> 29:25.221
It seems they were so charmed
by our rapport, they want us on the show.

29:25.305 --> 29:28.266
That's incredible! Yes!

29:28.349 --> 29:29.809
I knew we killed it.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.311
-We're going on <i>Shark Tank.</i>
-[squeals]

29:31.394 --> 29:32.937

29:33.021 --> 29:34.773
