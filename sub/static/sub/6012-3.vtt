WEBVTT

00:35.748 --> 00:37.748
Did you sleep well? Very.

00:39.068 --> 00:41.908
It hasn't taken me long to get used
to sharing a bed again.

00:43.788 --> 00:46.507
Who is it? Breakfast, madam.

00:46.508 --> 00:48.468
One moment.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:58.308 --> 01:00.347
Ah. Thank you so much.

01:00.348 --> 01:02.308
I can manage.

01:08.468 --> 01:11.388
Have you ordered something
for yourself? You can't have mine.

01:11.389 --> 01:14.228
It'll be here any second.

01:14.228 --> 01:18.108
You've worked up a good appetite.
I can't bear vulgar jokes.

01:18.109 --> 01:20.948
I'll make note of that. I've made
note of everything.

01:22.788 --> 01:25.028
How you look in the morning. How you
dress.

01:25.028 --> 01:27.067
How you put on your make-up.

01:27.068 --> 01:29.028
Why particularly?

01:30.828 --> 01:32.908
Because I want to acclimate myself

01:32.908 --> 01:36.028
with the routines and rituals that
will govern the rest of my life.

01:36.029 --> 01:38.347
Are you governed by ritual and
routine?

01:38.348 --> 01:41.508
I don't think I am. Do you really
have to leave today?

01:41.508 --> 01:43.468
I'm afraid so.

01:44.548 --> 01:47.347
Surely there are delights
in Liverpool we have yet to share.

01:47.348 --> 01:51.067
We've driven round Cheshire and
dined in public for almost a week.

01:51.068 --> 01:53.747
By some miracle, we have managed to
get away with it.

01:53.748 --> 01:57.227
Let's not push our luck.
Does it matter if we get found out?

01:57.228 --> 02:00.987
We're gonna be down the aisle before
you can say, "Jack Robinson." No.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.827
And yes, it does matter.

02:02.828 --> 02:06.707
I've been tarnished once and I won't
be tarnished again.

02:06.708 --> 02:09.747
Nothing is going to happen that
isn't properly announced

02:09.747 --> 02:12.787
organised and executed.

02:12.788 --> 02:16.148
Isn't that your breakfast?

02:32.908 --> 02:36.627
Miss Bunting says I've quite a gift
for it now I've got started.

02:36.628 --> 02:38.707
I left school when I were 11.

02:38.708 --> 02:40.827
What were I supposed to learn by
then?

02:40.828 --> 02:44.387
If I were at school now, I'd be
there at least till I were 14.

02:44.388 --> 02:46.547
What's the matter?

02:46.548 --> 02:49.028
Sorry, love. What were you saying?
Nothing.

02:54.068 --> 02:57.588
Before he left, Mr Bricker said he
wants to show us the della Francescas

02:57.589 --> 03:00.427
in the National Gallery when we're
next in London.

03:00.428 --> 03:03.707
You go. Actually, I wouldn't mind
knowing if ours is any good.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.947
We don't often see you for
breakfast.

03:05.948 --> 03:08.627
We've got a meeting to organise the
church flowers.

03:08.628 --> 03:11.268
The rota seems to have gone wrong.
Is Mary back today?

03:11.268 --> 03:14.828
Supposed to be. Good. We've been
sent a proposition from a man in Leeds.

03:14.829 --> 03:19.028
What's that? Let's wait till Mary
gets home then we can talk about it.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.228
Do you have any plans? I may walk
down to Yew Tree Farm.

03:24.228 --> 03:27.028
I'll give you a lift if you like.
Has Rose left? I think so.

03:27.029 --> 03:29.547
She planned to get an early train to
York.

03:29.548 --> 03:32.507
She wanted to spend the day with her
Russians which is nice.

03:32.508 --> 03:34.268
Are you ready to go?

03:38.308 --> 03:40.707
Edith is getting so fond of that
little girl.

03:40.708 --> 03:43.948
I only hope she isn't driving
the mother mad.

03:45.388 --> 03:47.907
Mr Carson, please may I make a
telephone call?

03:47.908 --> 03:50.667
Don't make it a habit.

03:50.668 --> 03:54.347
I'm sorry to ask but I wonder if I
might be alone.

03:54.348 --> 03:57.028
If you wish.

04:09.468 --> 04:12.867
Hello. I've read your advertisement
in the London Magazine.

04:12.868 --> 04:14.348
Choose Your Own Path.

04:17.827 --> 04:20.028
This is me. We'll talk soon.

04:21.868 --> 04:24.508
We're settled now. We just have to
get organised.

04:40.308 --> 04:44.707
Oh, what is the latest
from your ageing Romeo?

04:44.708 --> 04:47.347
If it's of interest, I haven't heard
anything from him

04:47.348 --> 04:50.707
since you and I last met.
Oh, how disappointing.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.947
To you, perhaps.
Not especially to me.

04:52.948 --> 04:57.307
By the way, how is Spratt?
He's well, I think. Why do you ask?

04:57.308 --> 05:00.067
He wasn't there to open the door. I
wondered if he might be ill.

05:00.068 --> 05:02.827
Oh, no. He's not ill. He's in
Liverpool.

05:02.828 --> 05:05.067
His niece got married yesterday

05:05.068 --> 05:07.708
and Spratt had to take her down the
aisle. Oh.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.828
It seems unlikely to think of Spratt
with a private life.

05:10.829 --> 05:14.147
Hm. Yes. Unlikely and extremely
inconvenient.

05:14.148 --> 05:17.867
But you can't begrudge him that.
Servants are human beings too.

05:17.868 --> 05:21.428
Yes. But preferably only on their
days off.

05:27.068 --> 05:30.147
So they want to take this witness
business further?

05:30.148 --> 05:33.307
I'm afraid so. It's a young woman,
apparently.

05:33.308 --> 05:37.187
She was on her way to meet a friend
by the Statue of Eros in Piccadilly.

05:37.188 --> 05:40.947
Now, she swears she heard Green
speak as she walked by.

05:40.948 --> 05:43.707
There was clatter from traffic but
she heard him say,

05:43.708 --> 05:45.787
"Why have you come?"

05:45.788 --> 05:47.827
Who was he talking to? She couldn't
see.

05:47.828 --> 05:50.907
She was quite short and behind his
back. She looked up when he spoke

05:50.908 --> 05:54.627
but it was only to see him fall into
the road. She kept quiet.

05:54.628 --> 05:57.827
Well, it was in the paper and they
said it was an accident.

05:57.828 --> 06:01.188
But that phrase haunted her. "Why
have you come?"

06:01.188 --> 06:05.268
Till she felt she had to report it.
I still don't see what brings you here.

06:06.348 --> 06:08.507
Green complained of a quarrel

06:08.508 --> 06:10.907
while he was staying at Downton.

06:10.908 --> 06:13.587
He felt badly treated, was angry
about it and...

06:13.588 --> 06:17.507
he told Lord Gillingham's other
servants. Why didn't they report it?

06:17.508 --> 06:20.427
Because everyone thought his death
was an accident.

06:20.428 --> 06:22.507
Until now.

06:22.508 --> 06:26.307
I'm sorry but as I remember, he was
in high spirits while he was here.

06:26.308 --> 06:28.987
Rather too high, if you get my
meaning.

06:28.988 --> 06:32.108
He had the maids and footmen playing
Racing Demon

06:32.108 --> 06:34.187
and screaming the house down.

06:34.188 --> 06:37.427
So you had no reason to believe he
fell out with anyone? None at all.

06:37.428 --> 06:40.067
He was rather a bumptious type

06:40.068 --> 06:43.028
but if anyone objected to that,
it was me.

06:44.348 --> 06:47.067
Isobel was asking about your
travels.

06:47.068 --> 06:50.187
She's coming for dinner this evening
so you can tell her yourself.

06:50.188 --> 06:52.508
Another cup of tea, M'Lord?
Thank you, no.

06:52.508 --> 06:56.028
You can show her your sketches.
Where are they anyway?

06:56.029 --> 06:58.107
Can't we see them? Now that you're
back,

06:58.108 --> 07:00.667
a building company has been in
touch.

07:00.668 --> 07:02.747
They want to put up 50 houses. 50?

07:02.748 --> 07:05.867
Modest ones. He's got his eye on
Pip's Corner.

07:05.868 --> 07:07.747
He wants to widen the lane to the
green

07:07.748 --> 07:11.427
to access the village centre.
They want to buy Pip's Corner?

07:11.428 --> 07:14.627
They want to build on Pip's Corner.
We take a percentage of sales.

07:14.628 --> 07:17.547
It's a good offer. I won't have 50
ugly modern houses

07:17.548 --> 07:19.907
built over a field of mine.

07:19.908 --> 07:22.148
Well, we don't have to make a
decision now.

07:23.108 --> 07:28.107
Hello, darling. Hello, Sybbie. Now,
let's go and sit by the fire.

07:28.108 --> 07:31.028
We want to hear all about your...

07:36.028 --> 07:39.908
The police must have muddled Downton
with some other place. I expect so.

07:40.348 --> 07:44.228
You don't remember any bad feeling
involving Mr Green, do you? No.

07:45.348 --> 07:48.188
Well, better get moving. They'll be
down in a minute.

07:49.708 --> 07:52.747
Oh, Mr Carson. There's a telephone
call for Mr Barrow.

07:52.748 --> 07:56.388
Go and find him, Mr Molesley, seeing
as you're the First Footman now.

07:58.548 --> 08:01.507
Are you free for a moment?
I've not got long.

08:01.508 --> 08:03.908
No, well, it won't take long.

08:08.908 --> 08:11.787
I've had a letter from my sister.

08:11.788 --> 08:14.267
The mother of my nephew Archie.

08:14.268 --> 08:18.587
He was shot, wasn't he, poor boy.
Yes. He was shot. For cowardice.

08:18.588 --> 08:21.587
His parents live in Farsley near
Leeds.

08:21.588 --> 08:25.067
Now, the Farsley people are putting
up their own memorial like we are.

08:25.068 --> 08:27.867
That's nice. Well, it is and it
isn't.

08:27.868 --> 08:31.867
You see, the locals only know that
Archie died in the War.

08:31.868 --> 08:34.626
They'll expect to see his name among
the rest. Yes.

08:34.628 --> 08:38.827
But the committee won't put him on
the list.

08:38.828 --> 08:40.866
He's... He's not worthy.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.587
Apparently. So says the War Office.

08:44.788 --> 08:48.147
I am sorry. That must be terribly
upsetting for her.

08:48.148 --> 08:52.667
Well, it brings it back for us, you
see.

08:52.668 --> 08:56.187
It brings it back
and makes his death nothing at all.

08:56.188 --> 09:00.547
I wish I could do something. Well, I
did just wonder...

09:00.548 --> 09:04.507
I mean, if she were able to say he'd
been included in our memorial,

09:04.508 --> 09:07.467
because of a family connection,
no-one would wonder

09:07.468 --> 09:09.667
why he was missing from the one in
Farsley.

09:09.668 --> 09:13.627
Have you spoken to Mr Carson? No.
I was hoping you might do that.

09:13.628 --> 09:16.787
Me? Well, everyone knows you can
twist him around your little finger.

09:16.788 --> 09:18.627
Then, EVERYONE is wrong.

09:18.628 --> 09:21.627
Well, will you have a go, please?

09:21.628 --> 09:24.347
We're about to start
the Hollandaise.

09:24.348 --> 09:27.148
So we've got time if it curdles.
Right. I'm coming.

09:28.628 --> 09:31.028
Please.

09:32.308 --> 09:36.108
I hope you're not too tired after
your exertions.

09:36.108 --> 09:39.227
Ooh, M'Lady. I'm not tired exactly.

09:39.228 --> 09:42.867
Oh, good. I'm glad if the wedding was
a success.

09:42.868 --> 09:46.587
Oh. The wedding was a success.

09:46.588 --> 09:48.747
Yes.

09:48.748 --> 09:53.307
Spratt, I have told you before, I do
not appreciate a man of mystery.

09:53.308 --> 09:55.747
If you have something to say, say
it.

09:55.748 --> 10:00.707
I would, Your Ladyship, but it may
not be quite right for me to tell.

10:00.708 --> 10:03.068
Well, if that is the case then do NOT
say it.

10:04.828 --> 10:06.907
Do you have some other business?

10:06.908 --> 10:09.707
Only that it may not be mine to
tell,

10:09.708 --> 10:12.427
but it is, in a way, yours.

10:12.428 --> 10:14.347
You're testing me, Spratt.

10:14.348 --> 10:17.747
And I warn you, being tested does
not bring out the best in me.

10:17.748 --> 10:21.427
No, Your Ladyship. I will not repeat
myself.

10:21.428 --> 10:24.747
Either impart this piece of
information,

10:24.748 --> 10:27.347
if you can empower yourself
to do so,

10:27.348 --> 10:28.827
or go.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.788
Very well.

10:32.708 --> 10:37.467
I hope Lady Mary enjoyed her time in
Liverpool.

10:37.468 --> 10:41.587
What? I was standing outside the
Grand Hotel this morning, M'Lady,

10:41.588 --> 10:45.667
when I saw her come out with her
suitcases.

10:45.668 --> 10:48.427
She was accompanied by Lord
Gillingham

10:48.428 --> 10:51.428
who had clearly also been staying in
the hotel.

10:54.588 --> 10:58.228
Well, yes. They were both staying
there.

11:00.228 --> 11:05.427
They were attending an informal
conference of northern landowners.

11:05.428 --> 11:10.347
Lord Gillingham thought Lady Mary
might derive benefit from it.

11:10.348 --> 11:12.387
So you knew about it?

11:12.388 --> 11:14.348
Of course I did.

11:16.148 --> 11:18.227
Why?

11:18.228 --> 11:20.747
What do you imagine you were
witnessing?

11:20.748 --> 11:23.828
Well... Nothing vulgar, I hope!

11:24.348 --> 11:27.307
Nothing beneath the dignity of a
butler of this house.

11:27.308 --> 11:31.388
Oh. Nothing... of... that... sort,
M'Lady.

11:32.428 --> 11:35.108
I'm glad to hear it.

11:37.068 --> 11:40.468
Now, if you'll be good enough to let
me drink my brandy in peace.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.834
You don't think Mr Bates ever knew
it was Mr Green, do you?

11:54.387 --> 11:56.387
What are you asking me for?

11:57.134 --> 11:59.253
I don't know anything you don't
know.

11:59.254 --> 12:03.754
Anyway, Mr Carson wasn't impressed
by the sound of the witness.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.740
But they could make out he was
in London that day, couldn't they?

12:06.805 --> 12:08.765
He left at dawn. He was back late.

12:09.445 --> 12:11.565
They'll say he could have managed
it.

12:11.566 --> 12:15.205
Even if Mr Bates was in London, we
have no reason to suppose

12:15.205 --> 12:18.645
he had anything to do with it. What
do you mean, 'even if he was'?

12:20.525 --> 12:23.685
Do you think he was? I don't know if
he was there or not.

12:23.685 --> 12:25.645
Why would I if you don't?

12:29.125 --> 12:31.164
They'll find out.

12:31.165 --> 12:33.125
About Mr Green.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.125
They'll find out what he did.
How?

12:37.405 --> 12:40.604
There's no-one in this house knows,
except you, me and Lady Mary.

12:40.605 --> 12:42.565
And she won't give it away.

12:44.085 --> 12:47.524
No, I don't think she will. There
you are, then.

12:47.525 --> 12:49.485
But they'll find out somehow.

12:55.685 --> 12:58.204
Of course you must bring them. If
you want to.

12:58.205 --> 13:01.605
They do so love an excursion.
It'll be fun. I'll come and help.

13:02.685 --> 13:04.724
What are you going to do in London?

13:04.725 --> 13:08.285
I have a fitting with Monsieur
Molyneux. He's over from Paris.

13:08.286 --> 13:12.044
The Dowager Lady Grantham is on the
telephone for you, M'Lady. Thank you.

13:12.045 --> 13:14.285
Will you stay at Rosamund's?
If she'll have me.

13:14.285 --> 13:17.404
Robert, any chance you could come
to? I'm afraid I can't.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.484
I've a dreary meeting all afternoon.

13:19.485 --> 13:23.164
What about you, Edith? I'm taking Mr
Bricker up on his offer

13:23.165 --> 13:26.524
to show me the National Gallery.
I'm watching little Marigold.

13:26.525 --> 13:28.924
Mrs Drewe is taking the youngest boy
to the dentist.

13:28.925 --> 13:32.564
Can't someone else step in? I said
I'd do it. Rose.

13:32.565 --> 13:35.325
We're taking my Russians to Howarth
where the Brontes lived.

13:35.325 --> 13:38.884
What will they make of the Brontes?
Good things surely.

13:38.885 --> 13:41.604
Hopeless lovers wandering over a
desolate moor.

13:41.605 --> 13:44.604
If it wasn't Emily Bronte, it could
be Tolstoy or Gogol.

13:44.605 --> 13:46.524
That's why I want to bring them to
Downton.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.404
They can compare the old Chekhovian
vie de chateau

13:49.405 --> 13:52.684
with the way the English do it.
Won't that make them unhappy?

13:52.685 --> 13:55.804
A little nostalgic maybe but they
seem to enjoy that.

13:55.805 --> 14:00.404
We have some Russian things here from
when Papa and Mama went in 1874.

14:00.405 --> 14:04.404
I shall look them out. What did your
grandmother want?

14:04.405 --> 14:08.444
She wondered if I'll have time to
look in tomorrow. That's all.

14:08.445 --> 14:11.844
I hope your flurry of telephonic
communication

14:11.845 --> 14:13.845
does not involve bad news, Mr
Barrow.

14:14.885 --> 14:16.964
My father's ill, Mr Carson.

14:16.965 --> 14:19.404
Oh, I am sorry.
Will you need time off?

14:19.405 --> 14:21.324
Well, I ought to leave in the
morning.

14:21.325 --> 14:24.684
Really? If you want me to see him
alive. Oh, my heaven.

14:24.685 --> 14:27.125
Of course I do.
Of course you must go.

14:28.165 --> 14:31.404
I'm sorry to hear it.
I remember your father very well.

14:31.405 --> 14:33.644
Don't pretend. You couldn't care
less.

14:33.645 --> 14:36.084
I've known your family for a good
long time.

14:36.085 --> 14:38.885
I may not want to be your spy but
nothing changes that.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.964
If you say so. Your dad was always
kind to me. Was he?

14:42.965 --> 14:45.004
Because he was never very kind to
me.

14:45.005 --> 14:48.284
You're quiet. Am I? I don't mean to
be.

14:48.285 --> 14:51.324
I was thinking we might get out for
a night when we're due time off.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.724
Somewhere peaceful. Away from here.

14:53.725 --> 14:55.764
Do you ever wonder what it would be
like to go

14:55.765 --> 14:57.844
to a place where no-one knows us?

14:57.845 --> 15:01.084
And just start again. Why do you say
that?

15:01.085 --> 15:03.444
I'm being stupid.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.084
That's why.

15:05.085 --> 15:08.285
I hear you're getting on well with
your mathematics, Daisy.

15:08.445 --> 15:10.764
An extra feather in your cap.
Yes, it is.

15:10.765 --> 15:14.764
But now I wonder... You wonder what?
Well, should I stop there?

15:14.765 --> 15:18.565
That's enough, Daisy. Come and carry
the spotted dick.

15:23.685 --> 15:25.605
Good night, Baxter.

15:28.765 --> 15:31.324
M'Lady, I hope you don't mind but I
would like to know

15:31.325 --> 15:33.364
whether I'm staying or going.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.964
You're right. I have made you wait
an unreasonable time.

15:35.965 --> 15:39.804
I just feel I need to plan if you've
come to a decision.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.765
I have. I think I have.

15:43.965 --> 15:47.845
Tomorrow I want you tell me
the missing element of your story.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.805
If you do, I'll give you a decision.

15:56.645 --> 15:59.364
Is everything planned for the trip?
It is.

15:59.365 --> 16:02.084
I'm looking forward to it. Really?

16:02.085 --> 16:05.244
I'm afraid I find those journeys a
slog these days.

16:05.245 --> 16:08.444
Do you ever think of the War?
What do you mean?

16:08.445 --> 16:12.244
How it was. When the girls were
working with the officers

16:12.245 --> 16:14.884
and I was running everything with
Barrow.

16:14.885 --> 16:16.764
I don't remember Mary doing much.

16:16.765 --> 16:21.764
Sometimes I find myself thinking how
busy we were. How useful.

16:21.765 --> 16:24.285
You can't wish those days back again.
Well...

16:25.285 --> 16:27.485
..I wouldn't admit it outside this
room.

16:29.365 --> 16:32.844
What was that business about
building houses at Pip's Corner?

16:32.845 --> 16:34.965
Nothing to trouble you with.

16:38.565 --> 16:42.364
So you had fun? Don't ask me to
elaborate.

16:42.365 --> 16:44.804
Have you set the date?
For the wedding, M'Lady.

16:44.805 --> 16:47.244
No. He's not trying to get out of it?
No.

16:47.245 --> 16:49.884
But there's no hurry. We don't have
to rush into it.

16:49.885 --> 16:53.644
By the way, would you do me
the greatest possible favour?

16:53.645 --> 16:57.124
I will if I can. Would you hide this
in the cottage?

16:57.125 --> 16:59.604
You mean the thing. Well, I can't
leave it here.

16:59.605 --> 17:02.524
Suppose Mrs Hughes found it. Or
Edith. Or Mama.

17:02.525 --> 17:04.884
Please take it. And the book.

17:04.885 --> 17:07.964
There must be a corner cupboard
in the cottage where no-one goes.

17:07.964 --> 17:10.484
Very well, M'Lady. Thank you.

17:12.244 --> 17:15.844
But I do feel I'm aiding and
abetting a sin.

17:15.845 --> 17:18.565
I just hope I won't be made to pay.

17:20.605 --> 17:22.964
I gather the local bobby was here
today.

17:22.964 --> 17:26.804
Carson said a witness had turned
up who'd seen that man die.

17:26.805 --> 17:31.004
But wasn't it a crowded pavement?
Surely there were hundreds of them.

17:31.005 --> 17:34.565
This one says she heard Mr Green
talking just before he fell.

17:34.566 --> 17:37.285
Sergeant Willis was asking if he'd
quarrelled with anyone

17:37.285 --> 17:39.564
when he was at Downton. Why?

17:39.565 --> 17:42.604
Mr Green had told the people he
worked with

17:42.605 --> 17:45.164
that he'd been treated badly while
he was here.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.765
HE was treated badly?! I know.
But...

17:49.325 --> 17:51.404
..we have to be on our guard.

17:51.405 --> 17:54.644
I mean, I'm sure Mr Bates never knew
it was him

17:54.645 --> 17:58.124
but if they find out what Mr Green
did, then...

17:58.125 --> 18:01.885
There can't be any evidence against
Bates. They'd have found it by now.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.964
What are you doing?

18:15.965 --> 18:18.685
Nothing. Is this some mysterious
present for me?

18:20.125 --> 18:22.724
No, it's something of Lady Mary's.
What is it?

18:22.725 --> 18:25.324
That's private. For her.

18:25.325 --> 18:28.164
Then why has she given it to you?
She wants me to keep it.

18:28.165 --> 18:31.485
Why are you putting me off?
I'm not doing any such thing.

18:32.365 --> 18:35.364
Add the name of a coward to our
memorial?

18:35.365 --> 18:37.444
Are you quite well?

18:37.445 --> 18:41.924
Mr Carson, surely by now we know
enough about shellshock

18:41.925 --> 18:45.284
to be more understanding than
we were at the start of the War.

18:45.285 --> 18:49.404
Look, I don't mean to sound cruel but
the lad was troubled

18:49.405 --> 18:51.484
and off his head for all we know.

18:51.485 --> 18:55.404
I'm sorry for him. I'm sorry for his
family and for Mrs Patmore.

18:55.405 --> 18:58.364
Well, then. But is it fair to the
millions of men

18:58.365 --> 19:01.124
who stood by their posts up to their
waists in mud,

19:01.125 --> 19:04.324
terrified out of their wits
yet determined to do their best

19:04.325 --> 19:07.004
for King and country? What do you
mean?

19:07.005 --> 19:11.564
Is it fair to say to them,
"Your sacrifice weighs just the same

19:11.565 --> 19:14.805
as the man who abandoned his duty
and ran for it"?

19:14.806 --> 19:17.925
I... I'm sorry, Mrs Hughes, but I
don't think it's right

19:17.925 --> 19:22.805
to make so little of the gift those
young men gave us when they died.

19:25.325 --> 19:27.725
I see.

19:39.685 --> 19:42.724
I hoped I'd catch you before we go.
Oh, yes?

19:42.725 --> 19:44.685
She's given me an ultimatum.

19:47.485 --> 19:51.644
What's she said? I must either tell
her the rest of my story or leave.

19:51.645 --> 19:55.444
And if you do tell her, does that
mean you can stay?

19:55.445 --> 19:57.484
She wouldn't commit herself.

19:57.485 --> 20:00.004
So what will you do? I don't know.

20:00.005 --> 20:03.884
There is a story, and maybe she has
a right to hear it.

20:03.885 --> 20:06.684
But once it's told, I want it back
in the ground and buried.

20:06.685 --> 20:09.644
Then make that your condition. What?

20:09.645 --> 20:12.725
She's made conditions so can you.
The worst that can happen

20:12.725 --> 20:14.804
is that she refuses and you go.

20:14.805 --> 20:17.765
Which will happen anyway if you say
nothing. Oh.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.724
You don't think he'll relent?

20:30.725 --> 20:32.804
I'm afraid not.

20:32.805 --> 20:36.565
I just wanted to be sure you knew
there'll only be four for dinner.

20:37.765 --> 20:39.684
She's told you, then.

20:39.685 --> 20:42.844
I have. They'd never have allowed
it.

20:42.845 --> 20:46.884
Is that so? But I don't want you to
think I'm unsympathetic.

20:46.885 --> 20:51.524
Yes, well... Sympathy butters no
parsnips.

20:51.525 --> 20:53.564
I'd better get on.

20:53.565 --> 20:55.604
What's the matter with her?

20:55.605 --> 20:57.684
She's had bad news.

20:57.685 --> 21:00.764
Oh, by the way, Mr Carson...
Yes, Daisy.

21:00.765 --> 21:03.685
..you wouldn't mind if I were to sit
an examination, would you?

21:03.685 --> 21:06.484
Not now. But when I'm ready.
That's a question for Mrs Patmore

21:06.485 --> 21:09.004
or Mrs Hughes. But you don't object?

21:09.005 --> 21:12.524
Well, since you ask, I'm not
convinced any of this extra work

21:12.525 --> 21:16.044
is necessary for your place in the
scheme of things.

21:16.045 --> 21:18.084
Mr Carson, Sergeant Willis is here.

21:18.085 --> 21:20.245
Hm.

21:21.845 --> 21:26.365
My advice Daisy is to go as far in
life as God and luck allow.

21:29.365 --> 21:32.244
Are you sure about this? I'm never
convinced surprises

21:32.245 --> 21:34.725
are all they're cracked up to be.
Don't be silly.

21:34.726 --> 21:37.165
I'll give her a treat.
I thought we might go dancing.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.364
I hear the new band at Claridge's is
marvellous.

21:39.365 --> 21:42.884
Does Aunt Rosamund know you're
coming? I'll tell her when I arrive.

21:42.885 --> 21:46.484
They were just going to have supper
together and go to bed. Bates.

21:46.485 --> 21:48.764
Mr Carson said you were looking for
me, M'Lord.

21:48.765 --> 21:52.324
My meeting's been cancelled.
I've decided to run up to London.

21:52.325 --> 21:54.884
Would you make up a bag for me?
Black tie not white.

21:54.885 --> 21:58.284
Would you like me to come with you?
No need. I'll be back tomorrow.

21:58.285 --> 22:02.844
Mr Bates? Well, that's it. He didn't
like Mr Bates. Not at all.

22:02.845 --> 22:05.644
And we know now that he said so to
Lord Gillingham's butler.

22:05.645 --> 22:09.084
Well, I don't remember that.
He mentioned Mr Bates by name?

22:09.085 --> 22:12.773
He called him 'the valet' and there
isn't another, is there?

22:12.774 --> 22:16.722
Not now. You do surprise me.
Mr Bates keeps himself to himself.

22:16.725 --> 22:20.884
You won't mind if I talk to him?
Not at all. Be my guest.

22:20.885 --> 22:24.004
You can take a seat and I'll send
for him.

22:24.005 --> 22:25.965
Thank you, Spratt.

22:27.125 --> 22:29.365
I trust you enjoyed your stay in
Liverpool, M'Lady?

22:33.245 --> 22:36.325
You found it extremely interesting,
didn't you, dear?

22:36.326 --> 22:39.164
Yes, I did.

22:39.165 --> 22:42.044
I think we'll have some tea. Thank
you, Spratt.

22:42.045 --> 22:44.125
Very good, Your Ladyship.

22:49.116 --> 22:52.836
Obviously, it's very shocking
to someone of your generation.

22:52.855 --> 22:56.855
Don't let us hide behind the changing
times, my dear.

22:56.856 --> 23:02.576
This is shocking to most people in
1924. Yes.

23:02.660 --> 23:08.460
Can we be confident that there will
be no unwanted epilogue?

23:08.460 --> 23:11.260
You can be quite sure.

23:12.380 --> 23:14.340
Well, I must say that makes a nice...

23:15.500 --> 23:17.620
A nice what?

23:17.620 --> 23:19.299
A nice kettle of fish.

23:19.300 --> 23:23.100
Is there any chance of a proposal?
Every chance.

23:23.100 --> 23:27.539
He already has.
He wants to set the date.

23:27.540 --> 23:31.379
Oh. Oh, I see.

23:31.380 --> 23:35.939
Well, I'm not saying I approve
because I don't.

23:35.940 --> 23:39.219
But it does put things in rather a
different light.

23:39.220 --> 23:41.099
Yes.

23:41.100 --> 23:44.979
When will you announce it?
I'm not sure. We haven't decided.

23:44.980 --> 23:47.019
Then you'd better get on with it.

23:47.020 --> 23:49.339
If I was seduced by a man,

23:49.340 --> 23:52.499
I would not let any grass grow
under his feet

23:52.500 --> 23:56.099
if he'd offered to do the decent
thing. I wasn't seduced, Granny.

23:56.100 --> 23:59.779
A young woman of good family who
finds herself in the bed

23:59.780 --> 24:03.779
of a man who is not her husband has
invariably been seduced.

24:03.780 --> 24:07.019
She couldn't have gone to bed with
him of her own free will?

24:07.020 --> 24:09.779
NOT if she was the daughter of an
Earl.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.339
Oh, there you are, Spratt.

24:12.340 --> 24:15.379
Lady Mary's been telling me all
about her conference.

24:15.380 --> 24:18.459
I hope you found it interesting,
M'Lady.

24:18.460 --> 24:20.940
I learned a great deal that I never
knew before.

24:22.580 --> 24:24.780
Thank you, Spratt.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.459
You've had the journey to think
about, Baxter,

24:42.460 --> 24:44.579
and I accept your condition. We have
time.

24:44.580 --> 24:47.420
I don't have to be anywhere till
later.

24:49.140 --> 24:53.379
At the house in Ovington Square,
there was a footman.

24:53.380 --> 24:55.340
His name was Coyle. Peter Coyle.

24:58.020 --> 25:02.179
He was very handsome and after a
while,

25:02.180 --> 25:04.380
I could do nothing but by his
permission.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.540
He was a cruel man although I
couldn't see it then.

25:10.780 --> 25:12.740
At least...

25:13.300 --> 25:15.339
..I could see it, really.

25:15.340 --> 25:17.780
He was nasty. And he made me nasty.

25:17.780 --> 25:20.259
And I embraced it.

25:20.260 --> 25:22.339
Tell me about the robbery.

25:22.340 --> 25:25.859
He handed in his notice and on his
last night, I took the jewels.

25:25.860 --> 25:28.219
He wanted them all but I only took
some.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.259
And you gave them to him and he
left.

25:30.260 --> 25:34.299
He said where to meet him the next
day and I thought he'd be there.

25:34.300 --> 25:38.859
But he never came. I never saw him
after. He got clean away.

25:38.860 --> 25:41.699
And you took the blame but why?

25:41.700 --> 25:44.179
I was ashamed.

25:44.180 --> 25:48.300
I'd let him change me. I'd abandoned
everything I believed

25:48.300 --> 25:50.379
to please a worthless man.

25:50.380 --> 25:53.139
Surely if you told the police now...
No, M'Lady.

25:53.140 --> 25:55.580
I won't bring it back to life. Leave
him be.

25:56.980 --> 25:59.379
As it is, he'll never know a day's
happiness

25:59.380 --> 26:01.340
for there is nothing good in him.

26:05.380 --> 26:08.739
So what might you have done in York
that would place you there?

26:08.740 --> 26:12.500
Now, let me think. I posted a letter
to an old army pal.

26:12.501 --> 26:15.380
Would he still have it? That I
couldn't tell you.

26:15.380 --> 26:18.939
Anything else? I made enquiries at a
shoe shop.

26:18.940 --> 26:21.659
Do you recall which one? Browns.
In Queen Street.

26:21.660 --> 26:25.579
They were opening up. Then I had
a cup of coffee at the Royal York.

26:25.580 --> 26:28.619
I went back there for a drink later
on before I caught the train home.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.699
In the middle of the day?

26:30.700 --> 26:37.300
I walked around. I had a sandwich at
lunchtime in some pub or other.

26:38.020 --> 26:39.980
Let me think.

26:40.220 --> 26:43.540
Don't worry. I've got enough. Thank
you for your time.

26:48.740 --> 26:51.299
No need to frown, Mrs Bates. Just
routine.

26:51.300 --> 26:54.180
But why would Mr Green say such
things about Mr Bates?

26:54.181 --> 26:57.980
Who knows? Anyway, everything seems
to be in order.

26:57.980 --> 27:00.060
Good day to you.

27:02.180 --> 27:05.380
I don't know why Mr Green would want
to make trouble for you.

27:06.460 --> 27:09.419
Well, I never liked him so I suppose
he never liked me.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.460
Yes, but to invent a quarrel then
tell the world about it.

27:13.580 --> 27:16.499
It's as if he were expecting me to
make trouble first

27:16.500 --> 27:18.899
and so he was covering himself in
case I did.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.860
It does seem like that, doesn't it?

27:22.940 --> 27:26.219
I have to get a mark out of His
Lordship's tails. Go.

27:26.220 --> 27:28.180
Of course. You go.

27:32.900 --> 27:36.020
Every figure shows a different kind
of reverence.

27:37.220 --> 27:40.580
Some eager, some contemplative.

27:40.580 --> 27:42.540
Some amazed.

27:43.540 --> 27:46.660
Even the magpie seems to have been
struck dumb.

27:46.661 --> 27:48.620
You're very sharp.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.179
Umbria was full of magpies

27:52.180 --> 27:56.579
so della Francesca chose a bird known
for its chatter

27:56.580 --> 27:58.540
and made it silent in wonder.

27:59.950 --> 28:02.029
How beautiful it is.

28:02.030 --> 28:05.110
I think your picture may be a study
for this angel.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.589
There are elements common to both.

28:08.590 --> 28:10.590
It was painted at the end of his
life.

28:10.590 --> 28:13.389
I envy him.

28:13.390 --> 28:16.990
To be able to create something like
this when death was closing in.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.429
I'd love to think I could still do
something

28:20.430 --> 28:23.229
that people talk about more than
four centuries later.

28:23.230 --> 28:24.910
You don't sound confident.

28:24.911 --> 28:28.190
I doubt they'll remember anything
I've done by the time my body's cold.

28:28.190 --> 28:31.670
I'm sure that's not true. You're not
but I like you for saying it.

28:31.671 --> 28:33.630
Come and look at this one.

28:37.590 --> 28:40.149
I'm afraid I'm taking up far too
much of your time.

28:40.150 --> 28:42.350
Not true. I'm enjoying myself.

28:53.030 --> 28:54.990
M'Lady.

28:57.390 --> 28:59.350
M'Lady?!

29:01.190 --> 29:03.150
Are you there?

29:07.430 --> 29:09.390
M'Lady?

29:12.310 --> 29:14.270
Wait here. Wait here.

29:32.350 --> 29:34.589
I didn't know where you were.

29:34.590 --> 29:37.990
Oh, you're back. She's been no
trouble at all.

29:37.990 --> 29:40.269
She should have gone when Tim got
home, M'Lady.

29:40.270 --> 29:43.069
I was enjoying myself. That's very
kind, I'm sure.

29:43.070 --> 29:45.270
Hey. Hello.

29:47.150 --> 29:50.789
Well, I suppose I should be off.

29:50.790 --> 29:53.469
Unless you'd like me to stay while
you settle Billy.

29:53.470 --> 29:56.749
That's generous, M'Lady but there's
no need. Good.

29:56.750 --> 30:00.509
Right. I'll be off then.

30:00.510 --> 30:03.430
Can I look in tomorrow?
You must be so busy.

30:04.510 --> 30:08.870
Why don't I come and then you can
turn me out if you like.

30:10.590 --> 30:13.270
Goodbye, darling.

30:13.270 --> 30:16.510
Bye. Bye.

30:16.630 --> 30:18.109
Honestly, Tim!

30:18.110 --> 30:20.429
She'll hear you. Let her get away.

30:20.430 --> 30:22.030
I can't manage it much longer.

30:22.031 --> 30:24.710
I'm sorry if she's lonely and
wants a child

30:24.710 --> 30:27.190
but she can't have ours. You're not
being reasonable.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.579
Just now, I thought she'd taken her.

30:29.580 --> 30:32.819
I did, truly. I wish we'd never
started it.

30:32.820 --> 30:35.299
Think what she could do for the girl
if she's a mind to.

30:35.300 --> 30:39.060
In 10 years or 15. Are we all to live
together in a threesome until then?

30:39.093 --> 30:40.623
Is that what you want? Me?

30:40.625 --> 30:42.945
I thought she was soft on you
but it's the other way round.

30:42.970 --> 30:45.290
You're the one who's soft. Soft in
the head!

30:50.449 --> 30:53.928
She keeps being engaged. I wonder if
there's a fault on the line?

30:53.929 --> 30:57.689
I'll send a telegram. I don't know.
I probably should go back.

30:57.771 --> 31:00.571
I'm in quite the wrong clothes for
dinner. Please.

31:00.571 --> 31:02.610
You said yourself she wouldn't mind.

31:02.611 --> 31:05.090
As for your clothes, you'll be the
best-looking woman

31:05.091 --> 31:08.411
in the Ritz dining room whatever
you're wearing. Oh, golly.

31:08.411 --> 31:10.491
That's cheered me up. I mean it.

31:10.492 --> 31:12.571
I so want to hear what you have to
say about it.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.171
I can't think why. I don't know
anything. Nonsense.

31:15.172 --> 31:19.251
You have an instinct for the key
elements of every picture.

31:19.251 --> 31:21.930
They speak to you. I envy that.

31:21.931 --> 31:24.891
Well, I probably shouldn't but I
guess I will.

31:28.571 --> 31:31.530
I won't stay out late, though.
Don't worry.

31:31.531 --> 31:34.090
You'll be home and safe as the clock
strikes 12.

31:34.091 --> 31:36.450
A lot sooner than that, please.

31:36.451 --> 31:40.291
But surely if Bates convinced Willis
he was in York that day...

31:40.292 --> 31:43.011
I only said it may not be over.
Why not?

31:43.011 --> 31:46.810
The sergeant's a nice man but he's
not the brightest button in the box.

31:46.811 --> 31:50.250
According to Mr Carson, Mr Bates
told the Sergeant

31:50.251 --> 31:52.570
he visited a shoe shop as it was
opening.

31:52.571 --> 31:56.050
The shoe shop is in Queen Street,
10 minutes walk from the station.

31:56.051 --> 31:59.330
Oh. He also had a cup of coffee at
the Royal York

31:59.331 --> 32:02.210
which operates as a station hotel.

32:02.211 --> 32:05.451
You mean he still had time to get to
London and back?

32:05.452 --> 32:09.011
Do you think Carson registered any
of this? I doubt it.

32:09.011 --> 32:11.450
And he wouldn't give Mr Bates away
if he did.

32:11.451 --> 32:15.050
But there's a danger that Sergeant
Willis or someone he talks to

32:15.051 --> 32:18.490
may put two and two together. They'd
still have to prove it.

32:18.491 --> 32:21.570
Yes, they would still need proof.

32:21.571 --> 32:23.531
Let's keep a hold of that.

32:25.371 --> 32:27.411
I had such a nice evening.

32:27.411 --> 32:29.371
Me too. I love London.

32:30.531 --> 32:33.330
Sometimes I forget how much but I
do.

32:33.331 --> 32:36.250
I remember when I first arrived.

32:36.251 --> 32:38.851
You don't want to hear about all
that. But I do.

32:40.971 --> 32:43.050
London scared me at first.

32:43.051 --> 32:46.370
I'd only been in a school room a few
months before.

32:46.371 --> 32:48.410
But my mother was eager.

32:48.411 --> 32:50.930
Why especially?

32:50.931 --> 32:53.891
We weren't really in the first rank
in Cincinnati.

32:53.892 --> 32:55.811
Still less when we moved to New
York.

32:56.251 --> 32:58.491
My father was Jewish and the money
was new.

33:00.171 --> 33:02.451
But there was a lot of it and I was
pretty.

33:02.451 --> 33:05.251
I suppose I can say that now I'm an
old lady.

33:06.091 --> 33:08.731
She thought you'd make a better match
over the Atlantic.

33:08.731 --> 33:12.170
And suddenly, here I was in these
vast ballrooms.

33:12.171 --> 33:15.610
And all the other girls seemed
to know what to do and what to wear.

33:15.611 --> 33:19.370
And how to flirt. I bet you were
more beautiful than all of them.

33:19.371 --> 33:21.491
More original. More real.

33:23.291 --> 33:26.771
I certainly got a lot of
names on my dance card.

33:28.691 --> 33:30.770
Listen to me bragging.

33:30.771 --> 33:33.651
Please forgive me. I never talk
about myself.

33:33.651 --> 33:36.610
Why did I say all that? Because I'm
interested.

33:36.611 --> 33:40.050
Well, it's time for me to stop.
We're nearly there.

33:40.051 --> 33:43.930
Can't we pretend we're not? And walk
round the square again?

33:43.931 --> 33:47.290
The truth is, I am quite
light-headed.

33:47.291 --> 33:49.370
Going out for a night on the town.

33:49.371 --> 33:51.971
Seems more my daughters' territory
than my own.

33:55.291 --> 33:57.211
You can't know what a good time I
had.

33:58.651 --> 34:00.690
Please may we do it again.

34:00.691 --> 34:02.651
I doubt it.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.571
But I hear the offer as a
compliment.

34:14.011 --> 34:16.331
Rosamund.

34:17.851 --> 34:19.811
I hope you got my cable.

34:21.210 --> 34:24.770
But I've had such a... Such a what?
..nice time. Robert!

34:24.771 --> 34:28.090
I didn't know you were coming up
to London. You never gave me a clue!

34:28.091 --> 34:30.810
It was meant to be a surprise. I got
a table at Claridge's

34:30.811 --> 34:33.210
so we could make a night of it.
I am sorry.

34:33.210 --> 34:36.251
Shall we telephone? Don't worry. I
cancelled everything

34:36.251 --> 34:38.251
when we got Mr Bricker's telegram.

34:38.252 --> 34:42.491
Where's Rosamund? Upstairs. She gave
me your dinner and went to bed.

34:42.491 --> 34:46.570
I'm dreadfully sorry. So you said.

34:46.571 --> 34:49.690
Wait a minute. I don't see I've done
anything to make you angry.

34:49.690 --> 34:53.291
No? I travel to London in order to
give my wife a treat

34:53.342 --> 34:55.943
only to find she's out dining with
another man.

34:55.944 --> 34:59.442
Mr Bricker wanted to discuss the
paintings.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.252
Rosamund said she needed an early
night.

35:01.308 --> 35:03.788
Why was it so wrong to accept his
invitation?

35:03.819 --> 35:06.858
Bricker was interested in discussing
the pictures with you?

35:06.859 --> 35:09.299
Yes. Is that so difficult to
believe?

35:09.300 --> 35:12.019
That an art expert would find your
observations on the work

35:12.019 --> 35:15.019
of Piero della Francesca impossible
to resist? Yes.

35:15.020 --> 35:18.939
It IS hard to believe. I'm going to
bed.

35:18.939 --> 35:21.899
Cora. It's quite all right.

35:21.899 --> 35:25.099
You've said what you think
and you've every right to do so.

35:35.978 --> 35:38.318
Tell me, does Edith seem very
distracted to you?

35:38.372 --> 35:41.372
I'm not sure I'd notice. Well, she
does to me.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.558
As if she were always thinking about
something else.

35:44.559 --> 35:48.359
I might say the same of you. It can
be hard to know what to do for the best.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.579
You don't want to hurt people but
you may have to.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.849
I know what you mean.

35:53.850 --> 35:56.170
Sorry. That just slipped out.

35:57.010 --> 35:59.610
Are you talking about Tony?
Maybe.

36:01.130 --> 36:03.890
I don't know. I'm not sure.

36:04.610 --> 36:07.890
I was beginning to think you'd
settled on him. I had. I think.

36:08.930 --> 36:10.890
But now, I seem to have unsettled.

36:11.890 --> 36:14.410
Goodness! I haven't said it out loud
before.

36:18.170 --> 36:21.089
So, what's he done wrong? Nothing.

36:21.090 --> 36:24.250
We'd never spent much time together
until recently.

36:24.250 --> 36:28.289
And when we did, I began to wonder
how much we really had in common.

36:28.290 --> 36:30.690
How recent was this time you spent
together?

36:32.290 --> 36:34.250
VERY recent.

36:35.210 --> 36:37.969
Are we talking about your so-called
sketching trip?

36:37.970 --> 36:40.129
Because I never believed in that for
a moment.

36:40.130 --> 36:44.170
The point is, I wasn't seeing him
clearly but now I do...

36:45.810 --> 36:48.769
He's a nice man. A very nice man.

36:48.770 --> 36:50.730
But not...

36:51.490 --> 36:54.129
I mean, of course, we talked about
things.

36:54.130 --> 36:56.889
But I think my judgement was rather
clouded by...

36:56.890 --> 37:00.090
By what Miss Elinor Glyn likes to
write about in her novels.

37:01.050 --> 37:02.849
Maybe.

37:02.850 --> 37:04.889
But I seem to have got over that now.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.329
Well, I won't ask how.

37:07.330 --> 37:09.290
Please don't.

37:09.970 --> 37:12.169
Well, I'll back you up if you
support me.

37:12.170 --> 37:15.089
Are we talking about Miss Bunting or
your move to America?

37:15.090 --> 37:18.009
I'm not sure. Either or both.

37:18.010 --> 37:22.009
Well, you're asking a lot. I'm not
very keen on Miss Bunting

37:22.010 --> 37:24.849
and I can't bear the thought of your
leaving.

37:24.850 --> 37:26.970
Well, if you love me, you'll support
me.

37:29.650 --> 37:31.610
Then I suppose I'll have to.

37:33.770 --> 37:37.209
I was wondering about Rose's Russian
tea. Shall we go together?

37:37.210 --> 37:39.169
Well, when is it?
This afternoon.

37:39.170 --> 37:42.169
Oh, good heavens. I'd forgotten all
about it.

37:42.170 --> 37:45.209
Well, I'm not sure I'll have the
energy. You must come.

37:45.210 --> 37:48.969
You've been to Russia. None of us
have.

37:48.970 --> 37:51.729
Did you get to know any when you
were there? Oh, yes.

37:51.730 --> 37:53.809
Oh, yes.

37:53.810 --> 37:56.329
Did you keep up with them?
Oh, I'm afraid not.

37:56.330 --> 37:58.569
An unlucky friend is tiresome enough.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.889
An unlucky acquaintance is
intolerable.

38:00.890 --> 38:03.370
You're all heart!

38:17.850 --> 38:21.009
We're back. Phew. I was terrified you
were going to miss it.

38:21.010 --> 38:24.289
No, not likely. By the way, before I
left, I asked Pattinson

38:24.290 --> 38:27.449
to look out the Russian things from
my father's visit. Did it happen?

38:27.450 --> 38:29.369
Oh, it did. And they'll be so
thrilled.

38:29.370 --> 38:32.249
If we're going to do it, we might as
well do it properly.

38:32.250 --> 38:34.329
Don't you agree, Mrs Patmore?
Yes, M'Lord.

38:34.330 --> 38:37.209
What's the matter with her? Nothing
for you to worry about.

38:37.210 --> 38:40.929
I'm not but what is it? Something
beneath your Lordship's notice.

38:40.930 --> 38:44.289
She'll get over it.
There's not nearly enough lemon.

38:44.290 --> 38:47.249
Well, shall I go down and tell them?
No, I'll do it.

38:47.250 --> 38:50.210
Tony, I don't believe it.

38:51.770 --> 38:56.529
What's going on? Don't ask. Rose
wanted to invite Russians for tea.

38:56.530 --> 38:59.329
And it's turned into a Jubilee
celebration.

38:59.330 --> 39:02.289
How was London? How is it always?
Large and noisy.

39:02.290 --> 39:03.889
Lady Grantham. Isobel.

39:03.890 --> 39:08.609
Well, I wanted to see you. You've
spent a day in a car for that. Yes.

39:08.610 --> 39:11.609
I didn't want to nag you over
the telephone when if I drove up

39:11.610 --> 39:14.769
we could make our plans together.
Good afternoon, my dear.

39:14.770 --> 39:18.889
Granny. Now, Granny, there's
something I'd love to show you.

39:18.890 --> 39:22.129
Hello, Lord Gillingham. It's
very nice of you to come for this.

39:22.130 --> 39:24.689
I came to see Mary, really.
Of course you did.

39:24.690 --> 39:28.409
And so you should.
You were always very kind to me.

39:28.410 --> 39:30.849
Mrs Crawley. Thank you.

39:30.850 --> 39:34.130
I don't think I am. Yes, you are.
I appreciate it.

39:38.050 --> 39:40.489
I'm sorry to add to your labours.
Don't worry, M'Lady.

39:40.490 --> 39:42.530
I'll have them sliced in no time.

39:42.531 --> 39:46.010
Daisy, are you ready? Daisy's busy
I'm afraid. I've got too much on.

39:46.010 --> 39:49.329
Why? What's happening? There's a big
tea for the Russian refugees.

39:49.330 --> 39:53.970
Your displaced Tsarist aristos. You
could always stay if you like.

39:55.330 --> 39:57.290
Lots to eat.

39:57.890 --> 40:01.569
I hope his arrival means you intend
to make it public.

40:01.570 --> 40:05.049
Darling, granny, you know how much I
value your advice...

40:05.050 --> 40:07.529
Which means you intend to ignore it.

40:07.530 --> 40:11.169
I won't be hurried into anything.
Not by you or him.

40:11.170 --> 40:15.569
But if you weren't certain, why on
earth did you go to bed with him?

40:15.570 --> 40:18.649
Well, in my day...

40:18.650 --> 40:22.609
a lady was incapable of feeling
physical attraction

40:22.610 --> 40:25.769
until she had been instructed to do
so by her mama.

40:25.770 --> 40:27.849
I don't believe that.

40:27.850 --> 40:31.370
Seriously, my dear, you have to take
control of your feelings...

40:32.450 --> 40:34.930
..before they take control of you.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.289
Baxter...

40:47.290 --> 40:50.569
M'Lady... I thought a lot about what
you told me yesterday.

40:50.570 --> 40:53.529
And I still think you should report
Mr Coyle.

40:53.530 --> 40:56.809
I won't, M'Lady. And if that makes a
difference...

40:56.810 --> 40:59.250
It won't. You may stay.

41:01.210 --> 41:03.170
Thank you.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.890
Thank you so much.

41:15.770 --> 41:18.369
Have you seen what we've dug out for
the Ruskies?

41:18.370 --> 41:20.889
Well, I say, 'we', it was Pattinson
who did it.

41:20.890 --> 41:23.650
Does it matter? You place no value
on my opinions.

41:23.877 --> 41:27.277
Cora, I was cross. I had travelled
the length of England

41:27.277 --> 41:29.597
to spend the evening with you and
you had gone out.

41:29.597 --> 41:32.757
Aren't I allowed to be cross? Cross
but not unjust.

41:32.758 --> 41:34.997
Would you excuse me? I think they're
here.

41:37.477 --> 41:40.557
M'Lady. Mr Drewe is at the back door
downstairs.

41:40.557 --> 41:43.997
He's asking for you. Should I ask
him to come up? No, I'll go down.

41:44.997 --> 41:48.836
They told me you were here. I didn't
know you were entertaining.

41:48.837 --> 41:52.076
It doesn't matter. What is it?
Tell me there's nothing wrong.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.516
Please. There's nothing wrong with
Marigold.

41:54.517 --> 41:58.316
Thank God. No. What's wrong is
Margie.

41:58.317 --> 42:01.796
I know I've annoyed her. I'm afraid
you must stay away, M'Lady.

42:01.797 --> 42:04.596
That's all. Not forever.

42:04.597 --> 42:06.557
But for now, you must stay away.

42:18.277 --> 42:20.317
M'Lady.

42:29.317 --> 42:32.917
You have Russian connections, Miss
Bunting? No.

42:32.917 --> 42:36.796
I'm here under false pretences.
Nonsense. You're welcome.

42:36.797 --> 42:40.436
What is THAT woman doing here? Rose
found her in the kitchen

42:40.437 --> 42:43.516
and asked her to join us. Why?
Don't be silly. She had to.

42:43.517 --> 42:45.556
Why do you let her irritate you so?

42:45.557 --> 42:47.837
How dare you say such things to me?!

42:47.838 --> 42:52.397
I don't think she meant any... She
curses the name of our Holy Father.

42:52.397 --> 42:55.797
The Tsar. I said he was misguided in
his policies.

42:55.798 --> 42:57.916
No. No. I can't listen to this!

42:57.917 --> 43:02.837
Lady Rose, would you please arrange
for us to return to York immediately.

43:02.837 --> 43:07.196
Oh, but before you go, won't you
come and see the mementoes

43:07.197 --> 43:10.116
of the wedding of Tsar Alexander
II's daughter?

43:10.117 --> 43:12.676
Lord Grantham had them put out
especially for you to see.

43:12.677 --> 43:14.876
You have Romanov's relics here?

43:14.877 --> 43:17.557
My parents went to St Petersburg in
1874.

43:17.558 --> 43:20.597
When Queen Victoria's son, Prince
Alfred,

43:20.597 --> 43:24.556
married the Grand Duchess Maria.
Grand Duchess Maria.

43:24.557 --> 43:29.036
Those words... They already make...

43:29.037 --> 43:30.556
me weep. Oh, dear.

43:30.557 --> 43:32.597
Oh, we can't have that.

43:32.597 --> 43:35.156
Thank you.

43:35.157 --> 43:38.236
Now do you see why she irritates me?

43:38.237 --> 43:41.197
Tom, keep her under control.
She only wants...

43:45.317 --> 43:48.877
I feel rather guilty. I thought
they'd enjoy the things we found.

43:48.878 --> 43:50.957
Oh, dear, no. They ARE enjoying
them.

43:50.957 --> 43:53.156
What were you doing in Russia?

43:53.157 --> 43:56.596
Lord Grantham was in the household
of Prince Alfred.

43:56.597 --> 43:59.756
And we went to St Petersburg for
their wedding.

43:59.757 --> 44:03.076
I suppose it was very splendid.
Oh, you've no idea.

44:03.077 --> 44:06.516
Receptions and balls. Glittering
parades.

44:06.517 --> 44:11.997
Rides in a horse-drawn sleigh.
Flying across the snow at midnight.

44:14.117 --> 44:17.117
Excuse me. Make way. Make way.

44:20.557 --> 44:22.396
Oh. Oh, how funny.

44:22.397 --> 44:24.757
I wondered what had happened to that
fan.

44:24.757 --> 44:29.356
That wasn't given to your father. It
was given to me. Who by? The Tsar?

44:29.357 --> 44:31.876
No. No. Not by the Tsar. No.

44:31.877 --> 44:34.956
No, we were at a ball.

44:34.957 --> 44:37.076
In the Winter Palace. And it was
so...

44:37.077 --> 44:41.476
Oh, it was so hot. There were
icicles hanging outside the window.

44:41.477 --> 44:44.796
But the rooms were as hot as the
tropics.

44:44.797 --> 44:48.396
I was wearing pale blue velvet.

44:48.397 --> 44:50.476
Trimmed with silver lace.

44:50.477 --> 44:54.516
And when I gave you this fan you hid
it in your reticule

44:54.517 --> 44:57.597
in case Lord Grantham should be
angry.

44:58.677 --> 45:01.276
Good heavens.

45:01.277 --> 45:03.556
I hope you can forgive me.

45:03.557 --> 45:08.596
When I knew the others are coming, I
could not resist the temptation.

45:08.597 --> 45:11.876
This is amazing. You know each other.

45:11.877 --> 45:13.916
You met in St Petersburg?

45:13.917 --> 45:15.837
We did.

45:16.997 --> 45:19.036
Allow me...

45:19.037 --> 45:21.197
to present my son, Lord Grantham.

45:21.997 --> 45:23.957
Prince Kuragin.

45:25.077 --> 45:27.916
I am flattered to be remembered.

45:27.917 --> 45:31.357
How is the princess? Well, I hope.

45:32.437 --> 45:35.077
I don't know.

45:37.717 --> 45:41.876
Why don't we go back to the hall and
have some more tea?

45:41.877 --> 45:44.557
Yes. Thank you.

45:45.477 --> 45:47.037
Thank you.

45:51.477 --> 45:53.556
Granny has a past.

45:53.557 --> 45:56.476
Thank heavens Papa and Aunt Rosamund
were already born

45:56.477 --> 45:58.877
or we could spin all sorts of fairy
tales.

46:00.437 --> 46:04.516
How's it going? There seems to be a
good deal of emotion being vented

46:04.517 --> 46:07.317
among the guests in the library but
then they are foreigners.

46:08.317 --> 46:10.477
Right. Now, I must get on.

46:13.397 --> 46:16.596
Stop giving me such knowing looks.

46:16.597 --> 46:19.676
I met the prince when I was
travelling with your grandfather.

46:19.677 --> 46:22.796
Nothing could be more respectable.
Whatever you say.

46:22.797 --> 46:25.556
Away with your impertinent
conclusions!

46:25.557 --> 46:27.636
My only conclusion is this -

46:27.637 --> 46:31.117
I know you understand my predicament
far better than you let on.

46:40.197 --> 46:42.637
Have you made plans to see your
admirer again?

46:47.757 --> 46:49.677
Drive on.

47:00.357 --> 47:02.836
I'm studying the Glorious Revolution
of 1688.

47:02.837 --> 47:05.397
They'll be a glorious revolution
here if you don't watch!

47:05.398 --> 47:08.836
I do hope this won't be something
you'll regret. I won't.

47:08.837 --> 47:12.316
You only say that to sound clever.
I know. You should try it.

47:12.317 --> 47:14.437
Good heavens. There's Charles Blake.

47:14.437 --> 47:17.037
I think you know Lady Mary Crawley.
Miss Lane Fox.

47:17.038 --> 47:20.317
We don't know each other exactly.
We know OF each other.
