03:01.445 --> 03:03.540
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Sir.

03:04.991 --> 03:05.909
Good morning.

03:05.910 --> 03:07.912
Good morning. I just
came to look around.

03:07.913 --> 03:09.663
- Yes, sir.
- All right if I go below?

03:09.664 --> 03:11.579
Certainly, sir. Can I
get you some coffee?

03:11.580 --> 03:14.250
No, I'll just go below and wait
for the captain. Maybe later.

03:14.251 --> 03:15.883
- Yes, sir.
- Chief.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.429
Who's he?

03:19.968 --> 03:22.551
- That's Sherman.
- Yeah?

03:22.552 --> 03:25.096
And what is he doing here
at six in the morning?

03:25.097 --> 03:29.235
He came to make sure that
you were comfortable.

03:29.646 --> 03:31.646
Don't you know anything
about submarines?

03:31.647 --> 03:35.024
Yes, sure. I know Sherman. He's
the boss of Submarines Pacific.

03:35.025 --> 03:38.361
- He was the first captain of this boat.
- Yes, I know that.

03:38.362 --> 03:41.881
Then you should be able to figure
out what he is doing here.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.454
If you were the first
skipper of the "Sea Tiger"...

03:46.455 --> 03:51.208
and you ordered her sent
to the junkyard at nine...

03:51.209 --> 03:53.969
what would you be doing at six?

04:36.470 --> 04:41.142
USN SEA TIGER
CAPTAIN'S JOURNAL

04:41.143 --> 04:43.603
December 10, 1941.

04:43.604 --> 04:47.066
Moored starboard side to Machina
Wharf. Cavite Navy Yard...

04:47.067 --> 04:50.152
Philippine Islands, for
provisions and fuel.

04:50.153 --> 04:52.739
Directive received from
Commander Asiatic Fleet...

04:52.740 --> 04:56.342
"You will sink or destroy all enemy
ships wherever encountered."

04:56.368 --> 04:59.497
Have advised Commander
Submarine Force, Asiatic Fleet...

04:59.498 --> 05:00.874
that "Sea Tiger"...

05:00.875 --> 05:04.712
...will be ready for sea at
19:00, 10 December 1941.

05:04.713 --> 05:08.257
Captain! Captain!

05:08.258 --> 05:10.187
Enemy planes over.

05:20.814 --> 05:23.871
- Ready on engines?
- The best we can, Sir.

05:34.328 --> 05:36.211
Cut those lines!

05:51.390 --> 05:53.318
Take cover!

06:25.389 --> 06:28.265
I'm not denying we suffered
minor damage, Sir, but...

06:28.266 --> 06:29.476
Minor damage??

06:29.477 --> 06:32.745
What does it take to convince you?
You've been sunk!

06:32.855 --> 06:35.524
- You ought to read your own report.
- Yes.

06:35.525 --> 06:38.569
â€œBulkheads, main ballast
tanks and pressure hull...

06:38.570 --> 06:40.112
ripped by bomb fragments.

06:40.113 --> 06:43.325
Engine room flooded, main induction
and ventilation wrecked...

06:43.326 --> 06:47.914
torpedo tubes, motor controls
and reduction gear inoperable...

06:47.915 --> 06:52.376
electrical equipment, wiring,
gauges, gyro, radio."

06:52.377 --> 06:53.836
All you've got out there...

06:53.837 --> 06:58.223
is a periscope sitting on a couple
of thousand tons of scrap metal.

06:58.844 --> 07:00.427
What do you suggest, sir?

07:00.428 --> 07:03.641
Should we underwater weld to jury patch
the hull before pumping her out...

07:03.642 --> 07:06.352
or should we raise her first
and then work on the hull?

07:06.353 --> 07:08.939
Matt, with major repairs
and a complete overhaul

07:08.940 --> 07:11.106
maybe Sea Tiger could be
put back in commission.

07:11.107 --> 07:13.943
- A functioning Navy yard might do it.
- Sir.

07:13.944 --> 07:18.073
My chiefs are pretty good hands.
They know they're on their own.

07:18.074 --> 07:20.744
And what we're up against. But we think
we can get " Sea Tiger " back in the war.

07:20.745 --> 07:22.411
Yes, on who's side?

07:22.412 --> 07:26.960
We're due to evacuate back
to Bataan on the 26th...

07:26.961 --> 07:31.170
two weeks to do a job a yard
couldn't do in two months.

07:31.171 --> 07:35.217
We don't think we can get her
into fighting trim right away...

07:35.218 --> 07:39.055
repair it... just enough to
reach the nearest sub tender.

07:39.056 --> 07:41.768
That would be the
"Bushnell", in Darwin.

07:41.769 --> 07:44.145
Almost two thousand
miles of ocean...

07:44.146 --> 07:46.608
with the Japanese
Navy roaming over it.

07:46.609 --> 07:50.611
And you're going to make it in a sub held
together with spit and bailing wire?

07:50.612 --> 07:51.695
Sir...

07:51.696 --> 07:54.615
the " Sea Tiger " deserves
a better epitaph than...

07:54.616 --> 07:57.577
"commissioned 1940, sunk, 1941.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.706
Engagements: none.
Shots fired: none."

07:59.707 --> 08:02.249
You can't let her go
that way, it's like...

08:02.250 --> 08:05.922
a beautiful woman dying an old
maid, if know what I mean...

08:05.923 --> 08:07.630
by an old maid.

08:07.631 --> 08:10.842
- Did you ever sell used cars?
- No, sir.

08:10.843 --> 08:13.387
I think you missed your calling.

08:13.388 --> 08:17.016
Okay, Matt. You've got two weeks
to get her out or we blow her up.

08:17.017 --> 08:18.649
Fair enough.

08:19.478 --> 08:20.520
By the way...

08:20.521 --> 08:23.943
three of my officers and eighteen
men have been transferred...

08:23.944 --> 08:26.443
- ...How soon can I can get them back?
- You don't.

08:26.444 --> 08:28.655
You'll have to get by
with a skeleton crew.

08:28.656 --> 08:30.824
I'll get you what
replacements I can.

08:30.825 --> 08:33.549
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

09:12.413 --> 09:14.260
All done.

09:16.543 --> 09:20.381
Men, clean up later.
That's all we can do now.

09:20.382 --> 09:22.217
An odd job but might hold alright.

09:22.218 --> 09:23.600
Yes, sir.

09:40.866 --> 09:43.623
Do you think the
No. 2 tank will hold?

09:43.743 --> 09:46.550
All that we can do is try, sir.

09:47.246 --> 09:48.789
- Which one are you holding?
- The left.

09:48.790 --> 09:49.916
Well hang on.

09:49.917 --> 09:52.344
Okay, give her some air.

10:26.291 --> 10:29.015
I found it, I found it!

10:29.461 --> 10:32.045
- Found it. Look.
- I give up. What is it?

10:32.046 --> 10:33.674
The cake that my mother sent me.

10:33.675 --> 10:37.691
Isn't that nice. Take it to the
cook, maybe he'll warm it up.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.522
Mothers.

10:41.810 --> 10:44.145
Why couldn't she send
something we need?

10:44.146 --> 10:46.786
Like a universal coupling joint.

10:54.365 --> 10:55.991
What is it, Molumphry?

10:55.992 --> 10:57.577
I do not know, sir.

10:57.578 --> 10:59.376
Have a look.

11:04.292 --> 11:06.294
Looks like the Good Humor man.

11:06.295 --> 11:09.648
- I wonder if he left his tie off.
- What's going on?

11:10.424 --> 11:12.983
- Take a look, sir.
- Okay.

11:14.806 --> 11:16.438
Holy moly.

11:26.235 --> 11:27.779
What is it?

11:27.780 --> 11:32.282
I hope I'm wrong, but with that suitcase
I'd say he was one of the replacements.

11:32.283 --> 11:34.343
Don't tell me that!

11:34.746 --> 11:36.664
- Oh, for heaven's sake!
- Do you know anything about him?

11:36.665 --> 11:40.292
Only from the society pages of
the Honolulu newspapers;...

11:40.293 --> 11:43.129
- His name is Lieutenant Nick Holden.
- Holden.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.506
He's the darling of the
high-class social set.

11:45.507 --> 11:48.552
- I'll bet he is.
- He and the Admiral's wife...

11:48.553 --> 11:52.024
won the rumba championship
two years in a row!

12:15.751 --> 12:19.353
Okay, fellows. Come on,
knock it off. Back to work.

12:29.810 --> 12:32.485
Lieutenant Nick Holden,
reporting for duty, sir.

12:33.311 --> 12:35.732
Excuse the misunderstanding,
Mr. Holden...

12:35.733 --> 12:38.778
It's unusual to see an Admiral's
aide without the Admiral.

12:38.779 --> 12:42.280
He was scheduled to be transferred.
I was sent to make arrangements...

12:42.281 --> 12:44.784
- then the war broke out...
- And you're stranded?

12:44.785 --> 12:47.495
Yes, sir. Captain Henderson
assigned me to you...

12:47.496 --> 12:50.288
He said to hurry...
before you left.

12:50.289 --> 12:52.040
The bearings are okay sir...

12:52.041 --> 12:55.546
but if we don't come up with an
oil pump shaft we will only...

12:55.547 --> 12:58.800
- ...get out of here by rowing.
- Didn't Hunkle follow up the requisition?

12:58.801 --> 13:01.720
Requisition? That's all we do.
But we never get anything.

13:01.721 --> 13:04.348
We might as well write a
letter to Santa Claus.

13:04.349 --> 13:07.156
Ya. Well, thank you, Tostin.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.522
- Have you ever been in a submarine?
- No, sir.

13:11.523 --> 13:15.527
We need a torpedo and gunnery
officer. Any experience?

13:15.528 --> 13:18.239
- Guns? I'm afraid not, sir.
- How about navigation?

13:18.240 --> 13:20.117
- Terribly sorry.
- Communications?

13:20.118 --> 13:21.951
Wish I could help, sir.

13:21.952 --> 13:23.078
Tell me.

13:23.079 --> 13:26.289
Before becoming an Admiral's aide
What did you do in the navy?

13:26.290 --> 13:28.751
Well, sir, I was
primarily an idea man.

13:28.752 --> 13:30.544
I see. Well...

13:30.545 --> 13:33.339
Tell me... what does
an idea man do?

13:33.340 --> 13:36.646
I coordinated the Navy day
parade in Milwaukee...

13:36.845 --> 13:40.264
and I was the special liaison officer
for the Eleventh Naval District.

13:40.265 --> 13:42.608
- Liaison? With what?
- Hollywood.

13:43.059 --> 13:46.104
I coordinated the design
of admission posters.

13:46.105 --> 13:49.623
From there I transferred to
Fleet Headquarters Honolulu.

13:50.442 --> 13:52.361
Is that where they
gave you sea duty?

13:52.362 --> 13:56.498
No, sir. I was the Recreation
Officer at the Royal Arms Hotel.

13:57.201 --> 13:58.745
Just for my information...

13:58.746 --> 14:01.789
What does an idea
man do in a hotel?

14:01.790 --> 14:04.835
The Navy took over the hotel
for officer's training...

14:04.836 --> 14:07.086
and I saw that entertainment
was provided.

14:07.087 --> 14:10.297
- Have you ever been to sea?
- Yes, sir, destroyer duty.

14:10.298 --> 14:14.094
- How did you find time for it?
- It was a mistake, sir.

14:14.095 --> 14:17.056
A week after I left Honolulu
they got it straightened out.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.434
Who, the Admiral or
the Admiral's wife?

14:19.435 --> 14:21.771
She must be upset with
you out here ;...

14:21.772 --> 14:24.649
that will cost her the rumba
championship this year.

14:24.650 --> 14:26.365
Holy!

14:28.739 --> 14:32.824
Here you go, my man. Will you take
this bag and clubs to the submarine?

14:32.825 --> 14:34.457
Thank you, son.

14:47.969 --> 14:49.219
Hunkle.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.970
What about that oil pump?

14:50.971 --> 14:52.973
Well, I put in four requisitions.

14:52.974 --> 14:55.810
- Did you put stamp them urgent?
- I put a requisition in for one, sir.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.646
- For what?
- An urgent stamp, we haven't got one.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.732
Haven't we received
anything from supplies?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.525
The only requisition
that's been filled

15:02.526 --> 15:04.821
is the requisition for
more requisition paper.

15:04.822 --> 15:07.531
Captain, I got the trim pump
broken down. Want to look at it?

15:07.532 --> 15:09.675
- Yes.
- All right, Hunkle.

15:10.745 --> 15:12.625
Can I help you, sir?

15:12.914 --> 15:15.499
No, not really. My name
is Lt. Nick Holden.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.293
- I'm Ernest Hunkle.
- Pleasure to meet you.

15:18.294 --> 15:20.141
Would care for some coffee?

15:20.212 --> 15:22.722
- Yes, thank you.
- Follow me.

15:30.224 --> 15:33.529
- Who is that?
- It's " The Prophet ", sir.

15:35.774 --> 15:37.399
His he always that cheerful?

15:37.400 --> 15:39.443
That's just the way he is, sir.
Don't mind him.

15:39.444 --> 15:41.361
- Cream and sugar?
- Yes, thank you.

15:41.362 --> 15:43.947
"Why even try?...

15:43.948 --> 15:47.494
If you're lucky enough...

15:47.495 --> 15:51.582
to live through today...

15:51.583 --> 15:55.170
tomorrow...

15:55.171 --> 15:59.604
you will die."

15:59.925 --> 16:01.688
I don't know...

16:01.928 --> 16:05.514
From the looks of things around here
he knows what he's singing about.

16:05.515 --> 16:07.391
- Your coffee, sir.
- Thank you.

16:07.392 --> 16:10.021
- Excuse me, I must get back to my work.
- Certainly.

16:10.022 --> 16:11.651
Thank you.

16:20.324 --> 16:21.921
Sir.

16:22.076 --> 16:24.580
- Sir. Look at this.
- What?

16:24.581 --> 16:27.792
Last June, when we were here,
I requisitioned toilet paper.

16:27.793 --> 16:30.417
Every time we've been back
I sent through a follow up...

16:30.418 --> 16:34.675
according to the book through
channels I even submitted a sample.

16:34.676 --> 16:35.884
So what happens?

16:35.885 --> 16:40.647
They responded: " Cannot identify,
requisition cancelled ".

16:40.807 --> 16:44.435
Not that I'm complaining, sir, but
this what I've been going through.

16:44.436 --> 16:47.104
All right, Hunkle. Relax...

16:47.105 --> 16:48.952
Take a letter.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.032
Let's see.

16:51.318 --> 16:53.445
- Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.490
From Commanding Officer
" USS Sea Tiger "...

16:56.491 --> 17:00.258
To Supply Officer, Navy Yard,
Cavite, Philippines...

17:00.287 --> 17:04.090
Dear Commander Submarine
Forces, etc...

17:04.208 --> 17:07.560
Subject: Toilet paper.

17:08.130 --> 17:09.297
One:..

17:09.298 --> 17:12.675
On 6 June, 1941...

17:12.676 --> 17:17.181
this vessel submitted a requisition
for 150 rolls of toilet paper...

17:17.182 --> 17:20.810
On 16 December, 1941...

17:20.810 --> 17:23.605
the requisition was returned
with stamped notation...

17:23.606 --> 17:27.041
"can not identify
material required".

17:27.611 --> 17:28.736
Two:..

17:28.737 --> 17:31.948
The Commanding Officer of
the " USS Sea Tiger "...

17:31.949 --> 17:34.325
can not help but wonder
what is being used...

17:34.326 --> 17:38.580
at Cavite as a substitute for
this unidentifiable material...

17:38.581 --> 17:41.174
once so well known to this command.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.128
Three:..
- Excuse me, sir.

17:44.129 --> 17:46.853
- What?
- Excuse me for interrupting.

17:46.884 --> 17:49.426
- Have you ever been to Las Vegas?
- Why?

17:49.427 --> 17:52.304
The boys up there would say you're
trying to make your point the hard way.

17:52.305 --> 17:55.307
Putting in requisitions,
going through channels...

17:55.308 --> 17:57.603
You've got to sneak
up a few back alleys.

17:57.604 --> 18:01.356
You need a Supply Officer to
help you find those back alleys.

18:01.357 --> 18:02.859
- You, Mr. Holden?
- Yes, sir.

18:02.860 --> 18:05.952
- You'd ruin your manicure.
- Here.

18:06.615 --> 18:09.421
Don't let my manicure
fool you, sir.

18:09.535 --> 18:13.078
I grew up in a neighborhood
called " Noah's Ark ".

18:13.079 --> 18:15.539
If you didn't travel in
pairs, you didn't travel.

18:15.540 --> 18:19.474
Why don't you make out a shopping list
and I'll see what's left at the market?

18:20.420 --> 18:23.592
You're not the volunteering
type. What's your angle?

18:23.593 --> 18:26.803
Same as yours. We both want
to get the submarine...

18:26.804 --> 18:30.016
out of here. You so you
can fight your war...

18:30.017 --> 18:31.474
and me...

18:31.475 --> 18:33.393
Well, let's say I'm an optimist.

18:33.394 --> 18:37.743
Wherever we're headed I am
sure I can get a better deal.

18:40.194 --> 18:43.155
Mr. Holden, I may regret this...

18:43.156 --> 18:46.200
but you've just been
made my Supply Officer.

18:46.201 --> 18:48.286
- Get your list from Hunkle.
- Thank you, sir.

18:48.287 --> 18:52.499
I am going to need a couple
of men. May I pick my own?

18:52.500 --> 18:55.852
- Right.
- Thank you, sir.

18:58.716 --> 18:59.883
Hunkle...

18:59.884 --> 19:03.439
I've got a list for you. We're
going shopping tonight.

19:13.734 --> 19:15.531
Turn on the lights.

19:28.124 --> 19:31.960
Look, gentlemen, I think
we hit pay dirt.

19:31.961 --> 19:33.380
- Do you have the list?
- Yes, sir.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.424
Take the stuff we need to the door.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.344
Let's go, we don't have much
time. Come on, guys.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.263
You grab the wire.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.516
- I forgot something, sir.
- What did you forget?

19:43.517 --> 19:46.436
I never wrapped up my
belongings for my kinfolk...

19:46.437 --> 19:49.440
- ...if we don't get back.
- Will you stop talking like that?

19:50.400 --> 19:52.652
They're going to find us and
shoot us down like a dog.

19:52.653 --> 19:54.697
- Will you shut up?
- Alright, Hunkle.

19:54.698 --> 19:57.531
He's got the right idea;
so be very careful.

19:57.532 --> 20:01.799
- Get it to the door.
- Don't forget what you promised ;...

20:02.622 --> 20:06.639
When the shooting starts turn your
back so Gertie won't get splattered.

20:08.504 --> 20:09.673
Who is Gertie?

20:09.674 --> 20:11.758
- You don't know about Gertie?
- Shut up.

20:11.759 --> 20:14.102
Get moving with that thing.

20:16.889 --> 20:18.305
Hunkle, who is Gertie?

20:18.306 --> 20:21.612
Molumphry will be happy
with this wiring.

20:23.062 --> 20:25.490
Hunkle, I asked you a question.

20:33.701 --> 20:34.909
Who is Gertie?

20:34.910 --> 20:37.501
- The truth is that she's nobody.
- Hunkle.

20:40.206 --> 20:43.919
Well, sir, when my enlistment
was up last year, the boys...

20:43.920 --> 20:46.005
gave me a farewell party.

20:46.006 --> 20:49.977
I do not usually drink, sir,
but that night I must have.

20:50.136 --> 20:51.846
The last thing I remember...

20:51.847 --> 20:55.235
is standing in front
of a tattoo parlor...

21:03.318 --> 21:05.294
May I?

21:09.200 --> 21:13.328
- They ought to hang you in the Louvre.
- I came home to marry...

21:13.329 --> 21:16.833
but when I saw myself in
the mirror, I reenlisted.

21:16.834 --> 21:19.376
I never could explain
Gertie to my fiancÃ©e.

21:19.377 --> 21:22.766
No. I can see you've got a problem.

21:23.718 --> 21:25.467
But look on the bright side ;...

21:25.468 --> 21:28.512
You've probably got the
sexiest chest in the Navy.

21:28.513 --> 21:30.278
- Sir.
- Yes.

21:30.515 --> 21:33.811
I am not one to worry when
there's no need but...

21:33.812 --> 21:37.105
after we get this stuff to the door,
how do we get it to the boat?

21:37.106 --> 21:41.109
Don't worry about that, just
keep your stuff... The police!

21:41.110 --> 21:43.954
<i>Check the warehouses.</i>

22:01.760 --> 22:03.560
Halt!

22:07.601 --> 22:08.810
What's your business here?

22:08.811 --> 22:12.397
- I stepped out for a breath of air.
- Let's see your identification.

22:12.398 --> 22:15.571
Certainly. Here you are.

22:16.152 --> 22:17.611
Lieutenant.

22:17.612 --> 22:19.071
Why black face, sir?

22:19.072 --> 22:22.451
Don't you know the penalty for
breaking blackout regulations?

22:22.452 --> 22:25.829
- Blackout regulations?
- You read the order from Admiral Nimitz?

22:25.830 --> 22:28.791
- No. What order?
- Regulation 4-1-9-8-2:..

22:28.792 --> 22:32.295
"... no navy personnel shall appear
at night without face camouflage."

22:32.296 --> 22:36.799
A plane comes over, you look
up, give away our position.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.304
Sergeant, a face like that
could cause a lot of damage...

22:39.305 --> 22:41.223
I'll have to put you on report.

22:41.224 --> 22:43.933
Honestly, sir, no one
told me about it.

22:43.934 --> 22:45.947
Alright, you've been told.

22:46.855 --> 22:48.897
Black out that face, Sgt.

22:48.898 --> 22:51.538
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

23:06.169 --> 23:09.011
- Admiral Nimitz?
- Yes, sir.

23:20.144 --> 23:22.518
- Hey that was close.
- It's a trap...

23:22.519 --> 23:24.521
we used to take
possums like that...

23:24.522 --> 23:27.735
you fool them so they
feel safe and then, bang!

23:27.736 --> 23:31.871
- We are three possums waiting...
- Come on, Prophet. Just...

23:32.115 --> 23:35.669
We've only got a couple of
minutes. Get the stuff.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.776
- Hey Chief!
- Yes, Dooley?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.754
Your shaft's here.

24:09.408 --> 24:11.123
Thanks, Dooley.

24:12.328 --> 24:15.206
Look, Molumphry, brand
new oil pump shaft.

24:15.207 --> 24:18.262
Congratulations, look's
like you, Tostin.

24:20.837 --> 24:23.381
- What is that?
- Your refrigerator unit.

24:23.382 --> 24:25.675
- That?
- We were lucky to get it.

24:25.676 --> 24:28.151
Man, it was cold in that ice house.

24:28.973 --> 24:32.225
- Look, sir, new oil pump shaft.
- Fine, fine.

24:32.226 --> 24:34.936
- Where is Mr. Holden?
- Keeping an eye on the truck.

24:34.937 --> 24:36.652
Mr. Holden!

24:39.693 --> 24:42.820
- A decent night for shopping, sir.
- Yes.

24:42.821 --> 24:44.530
Could be something saved.

24:44.531 --> 24:48.535
I know where you got the Navy
supplies but what about the truck?

24:48.536 --> 24:52.580
I can't take credit for the
truck, sir. Ramon got it.

24:52.581 --> 24:54.890
- Ramon?
- Ramon!

24:56.045 --> 24:58.088
Smile, sir. He's very sensitive.

24:58.089 --> 25:01.175
- What?
- Captain Sherman, Sergeant Gillardo.

25:01.176 --> 25:03.928
I'm happy to be a member
of your crew, sir.

25:03.929 --> 25:06.570
What do you mean,
member of my crew??

25:06.641 --> 25:08.267
Well, sir...

25:08.268 --> 25:11.728
I promised the sergeant that if he
helped us out, you'll take him on.

25:11.729 --> 25:13.230
But he's a marine.

25:13.231 --> 25:17.248
Well, he's open to a better offer.
You'd better get back to work.

25:19.071 --> 25:20.953
I'll handle this.

25:23.161 --> 25:24.661
That man is a prisoner.

25:24.662 --> 25:27.831
Well, it was. You see, the
prison stockade was bombed...

25:27.832 --> 25:30.708
you have no idea how
hard it was to find him.

25:30.709 --> 25:32.918
You mean you actually
went looking for him?

25:32.919 --> 25:35.505
Of course. He's the greatest
operator around here...

25:35.506 --> 25:38.551
shortly after he became
General Warren's chef...

25:38.552 --> 25:40.971
- ...he went into business for himself.
- I'll bet.

25:40.972 --> 25:43.862
He was sole owner of best
restaurant in Manila.

25:43.934 --> 25:45.935
And what about the
" P " on his back?

25:45.936 --> 25:47.866
- The " P"?
- Yes.

25:47.897 --> 25:50.074
Oh, that...
Let's start there.

25:50.564 --> 25:54.069
You see, someone started prying
and found that the Marines...

25:54.070 --> 25:58.783
supplying all the meat and silverware...
But he's a man who can get a job done.

25:58.784 --> 26:02.788
There isn't a burglar, swindler,
pickpocket or fence on the island...

26:02.789 --> 26:05.124
that doesn't love,
know, and respect him.

26:05.125 --> 26:08.545
That's probably a glowing
recommendation, Mr. Holden...

26:08.546 --> 26:11.089
I have no intention of
taking a thief on my crew...

26:11.090 --> 26:14.008
He's an escaped
prisoner, a deserter.

26:14.009 --> 26:17.387
- True, but he is also one other thing.
- What?

26:17.388 --> 26:19.946
He's also an informer...

26:20.142 --> 26:23.686
and if we don't take him he
will tell everybody everything.

26:23.687 --> 26:24.813
Yeah.

26:24.814 --> 26:27.290
And you're in too deep
for than now, sir.

26:27.443 --> 26:30.615
We don't have a sales slip
for all this merchandise.

26:31.112 --> 26:33.989
It seems I'm boxed in, Mr. Holden.

26:33.990 --> 26:38.376
You've made a wise decision, sir.
I will tell him, he will be so happy.

26:39.789 --> 26:41.505
Ramon!

26:47.799 --> 26:49.466
You have to give him credit, sir...

26:49.467 --> 26:51.676
- that's what I call a Supply Officer.
- What?

26:51.677 --> 26:53.679
I wonder where he got everything.

26:53.680 --> 26:57.475
There's only one way to live with the
situation. It's like watching a stripper...

26:57.476 --> 27:00.981
do not ask how she does it,
just enjoy what's coming off.

27:03.650 --> 27:07.612
19 December, 1941.
The repairs are progressing.

27:07.613 --> 27:09.948
Morale is high, except for
their concern that...

27:09.949 --> 27:12.491
our supply officer might
be caught and shot.

27:12.492 --> 27:14.177
My emotions about this are mixed...

27:14.678 --> 27:17.682
Lt. Holden and Sgt.
Gillardo are undoubtedly...

27:17.683 --> 27:20.240
the world's greatest thieves.

27:20.812 --> 27:22.492
Scavengers.

27:22.564 --> 27:24.564
To paraphrase Mr. Churchill ;...

27:24.565 --> 27:28.485
" never have so few stolen
so much from so many."

27:28.486 --> 27:31.113
And what they can not
find in warehouses...

27:31.114 --> 27:33.089
they improvise.

27:54.435 --> 27:58.145
Mr. Sherman, I'm aware that there
has been wholesale scavenging...

27:58.146 --> 28:00.565
No, up to now I overlooked
it, knowing the position.

28:00.566 --> 28:03.610
- Yes, sir.
- But this time you've gone too far.

28:03.611 --> 28:05.493
Mr. Sherman...

28:07.491 --> 28:09.918
I want my wall back.

28:11.412 --> 28:15.582
- I'm not sure we have it.
- You must have it. You've got everything else.

28:15.583 --> 28:18.378
I do not mind a bit of
initiative but you...

28:18.379 --> 28:20.807
Sir, I have to get back to my boat.

28:22.549 --> 28:25.107
Wait a minute, I'll go with you!

29:15.278 --> 29:17.778
- Any damage?
- No direct hit, sir.

29:17.779 --> 29:21.032
Concussion may have sprung some plates
in the tanks, Mr. Watson's checking.

29:21.033 --> 29:23.077
Or camouflage caught
fire, we cut it down.

29:23.078 --> 29:24.912
- Were we spotted?
- Yes, sir.

29:24.913 --> 29:26.997
A couple gave us a close-up
look we could spit at...

29:26.998 --> 29:30.090
without the. 50 that's
all we could do.

29:36.343 --> 29:38.220
Well, I guess that does it.

29:38.221 --> 29:42.350
- Now they'll know where to find us.
- I'm sorry, Matt.

29:42.351 --> 29:44.978
Sir, request permission
to get underway.

29:44.979 --> 29:46.561
- Get underway?
- Yes.

29:46.562 --> 29:47.646
In that?

29:47.647 --> 29:50.275
I can get as far as Cebu
and complete repairs.

29:50.276 --> 29:52.402
- Cebu??
- That's only 400 miles.

29:52.403 --> 29:55.698
You'd be in trouble if it was 400 feet.
You're in no condition to go out.

29:55.699 --> 29:58.868
- We've made amazing progress.
- You can not even submerge...

29:58.869 --> 30:02.581
If you try running on top in the
daylight you're a dead duck.

30:02.582 --> 30:04.334
- Molumphry!
- Yes, sir?

30:04.335 --> 30:07.919
- Can this boat go down?
- Like a rock, sir.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.964
- Mr. Watson, how are the plates?
- Tight as a drum, sir.

30:10.965 --> 30:14.469
- And the engines, Tostin?
- Factory fresh, sir.

30:14.470 --> 30:16.096
What do you say, sir?

30:16.097 --> 30:19.350
Take your scavengers and
these liars and get out.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.270
- Yes, sir.
- But one stipulation.

30:21.271 --> 30:23.980
You will engage no enemy
shipping, including lifeboats.

30:23.981 --> 30:28.278
If you see someone swimming
in the water avoid him.

30:28.279 --> 30:29.653
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck.

30:29.654 --> 30:31.285
Thank you, sir.

30:31.490 --> 30:33.116
Matt.

30:33.117 --> 30:36.287
Is this what's left of my wall?

30:36.288 --> 30:37.621
I wouldn't know, sir.

30:37.622 --> 30:39.581
I would appreciate at least...

30:39.582 --> 30:42.259
- ...getting my window back.
- Yes, sir.

30:47.301 --> 30:48.842
Can we make it?

30:48.843 --> 30:51.345
Well, we have No. 1
engine in shape.

30:51.346 --> 30:53.930
No. 2 I'll tell you about
when it's put back together.

30:53.931 --> 30:55.183
How about three and four?

30:55.184 --> 30:57.644
I've been using them for
parts for one and two.

30:57.645 --> 31:01.858
I am a religious man, Captain, I
believe God will get us through.

31:01.859 --> 31:05.246
Of course, He'll have to give
us his undivided attention.

31:06.071 --> 31:07.406
Mr. Watson!

31:07.407 --> 31:10.449
Be ready to get underway when
Mr. Holden and his gang get back.

31:10.450 --> 31:12.203
- Aye, sir.
- Any idea where they went?

31:12.204 --> 31:14.831
No, sir. When the air raid
started they took off.

31:14.832 --> 31:19.597
All Mr. Holden said was:
"in confusion there is profit."

31:32.433 --> 31:34.478
Obviously the same guys who...

31:34.479 --> 31:38.745
Sir, we just got a call from the
Security Officer, and he's furious.

31:39.193 --> 31:40.735
Why? What's wrong?

31:40.736 --> 31:43.579
Apparently someone stole his safe.

31:56.755 --> 31:58.934
What happened, sir?

31:59.466 --> 32:04.231
Douglas, I think we've been victims
of Sherman's march to the sea.

32:04.847 --> 32:07.683
Make all preparations
for getting underway.

32:07.684 --> 32:08.726
Aye aye, sir.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.685
Station the watch.

32:10.686 --> 32:12.913
Lookouts to posts for sea.

32:17.946 --> 32:20.504
- Ready to get underway?
- Ready, sir.

32:22.369 --> 32:23.785
Get ready on No. 1 engine.

32:23.786 --> 32:26.795
Maneuvering, Bridge.
Get ready on No. 1 engine.

32:46.104 --> 32:47.646
Ready on No. 1 engine.

32:47.647 --> 32:50.453
Maneuvering, Bridge.
Get ready on No. 1 engine.

33:15.388 --> 33:16.763
Any time they're ready.

33:16.764 --> 33:19.405
Maneuvering, Bridge.
Any time you're ready.

33:47.174 --> 33:49.592
Mr. Holden! What the devil is that?

33:49.593 --> 33:53.471
A witch doctor, sir. Ramon found
him in the hills. We hired him.

33:53.472 --> 33:55.354
You hired him?

33:55.433 --> 33:58.395
To ward off evil spirits and
wish us a safe journey.

33:58.396 --> 34:01.452
I figured we could use all
the help we could get, sir.

34:15.414 --> 34:17.045
Hey hey hey hey.

34:17.708 --> 34:18.918
Cut that out.

34:18.918 --> 34:22.339
Mr. Holden! Will you
tell this fella...

34:22.340 --> 34:24.813
I can't hear myself think!

34:25.009 --> 34:27.319
Go away, please!

34:28.722 --> 34:32.739
Get away from my boat!
Get away from my...!

34:41.945 --> 34:43.112
Single up all lines.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.710
Single one.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.248
Single four.

34:50.496 --> 34:52.175
Right full rudder.

34:55.002 --> 34:57.045
All ahead one third,
starboard back one third.

34:57.047 --> 34:59.047
All ahead one third,
starboard back one third.

34:59.048 --> 35:00.646
What a character.

35:16.611 --> 35:18.195
All stop. Shift your rudder.

35:18.196 --> 35:20.290
All stop. Shift your rudder.

35:33.755 --> 35:35.756
All ahead two thirds.
Ease your rudder.

35:35.757 --> 35:38.101
All ahead two thirds.
Ease your rudder.

36:04.832 --> 36:06.976
You'll never make it.

36:24.148 --> 36:26.774
Tostin is still fighting with
the No. 2 engine, sir.

36:26.775 --> 36:28.704
Sounds like he's losing.

36:28.944 --> 36:30.485
How's the battery charge?

36:30.486 --> 36:33.030
Just enough for a trim dive.

36:33.031 --> 36:34.407
Okay to try it?

36:34.408 --> 36:38.260
Not now, wait for the dawn,
we have to take it down then.

36:38.288 --> 36:40.631
We will have to try it sometime.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.251
I'm not complaining, sir.
I had my choice.

36:43.252 --> 36:44.634
Of what?

36:44.711 --> 36:46.855
I could have gone to West Point.

36:49.967 --> 36:51.683
Careful, sir.

36:59.770 --> 37:01.772
Well, now is the time.

37:01.773 --> 37:03.440
Let's take her down.

37:03.441 --> 37:04.567
Aye, sir.

37:04.568 --> 37:06.570
- Clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge.

37:06.571 --> 37:08.029
- Number one.
- Aye.

37:08.030 --> 37:09.407
- Number Two.
- Aye.

37:09.408 --> 37:11.669
- Number Three.
- Number Four.

37:19.752 --> 37:22.844
- Make depth five-eight feet.
- Aye, sir. Five-eight feet.

37:27.803 --> 37:29.520
Five-eight feet.

37:34.727 --> 37:36.324
Check your bubble.

37:49.162 --> 37:50.959
Close all vents.

38:01.217 --> 38:02.551
All ahead one third.

38:02.552 --> 38:04.433
All ahead one third.

38:12.105 --> 38:13.784
Periscope depth.

38:14.732 --> 38:18.120
Let's check for leaks.
Take her down to 100 feet.

38:21.865 --> 38:23.201
All ahead two-thirds.

38:23.202 --> 38:24.492
All ahead two-thirds.

38:24.493 --> 38:26.636
6 degrees down bubble.

38:39.178 --> 38:41.845
All departments check for leaks.
Report to control.

38:41.846 --> 38:44.100
All departments check
for leaks. Report to control.

38:44.101 --> 38:46.726
Close watertight doors.
Close bulkhead flappers.

38:46.727 --> 38:49.702
Close watertight doors.
Close bulkhead flappers.

38:59.117 --> 39:00.500
She creaks a bit.

39:05.457 --> 39:08.216
She's sure moaning
and groaning, sir.

39:11.464 --> 39:13.179
Cycle all vents.

39:17.888 --> 39:21.184
I doubt if Sam Sneed would
approve of using irons that way.

39:21.185 --> 39:23.603
We were lucky that Mr. Holden
had a set of golf clubs.

39:23.604 --> 39:25.152
Aren't we?

39:30.444 --> 39:33.619
Guess we didn't bleed all the air
out of the hydraulic system.

39:36.786 --> 39:38.797
100 feet.

39:55.932 --> 39:59.144
You can't win, my friend.

39:59.145 --> 40:01.239
You can't win.

40:01.981 --> 40:06.711
You can't win, so why even try?

40:07.363 --> 40:10.157
If you're lucky enough...

40:10.158 --> 40:12.917
to live through today...

40:13.870 --> 40:18.338
Tomorrow you will die.

40:18.457 --> 40:20.968
All compartments report tight, sir.

40:24.382 --> 40:25.674
Thank you.

40:25.675 --> 40:27.900
Open the watertight doors.

40:32.432 --> 40:33.850
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

40:33.851 --> 40:36.769
If you're ready for breakfast,
sir, I'll be in the wardroom.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.814
- What is that?
- Orange juice, sir.

40:38.815 --> 40:40.023
Where are you taking it?

40:40.024 --> 40:43.081
For Mr. Holden. He's
having breakfast in bed.

40:43.446 --> 40:46.073
Wait a moment, Sgt.

40:46.074 --> 40:48.798
- I'll take it down.
- Yes, sir.

40:54.458 --> 40:56.600
May I come in?

40:58.339 --> 40:59.546
Please do.

40:59.547 --> 41:01.548
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Holden.

41:01.549 --> 41:05.104
- I've got a bad neck from too much tennis.
- Really?

41:05.513 --> 41:07.723
Well. Did you get a
good night's sleep?

41:07.724 --> 41:10.725
Not too good; it was a little damp
and noisy. Strange surroundings.

41:10.726 --> 41:12.787
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:12.853 --> 41:14.063
Thank you.

41:14.064 --> 41:16.524
Well, how's the food? Satisfactory?

41:16.525 --> 41:18.401
Excellent, thank you.

41:18.402 --> 41:21.292
- Would you like a cigar?
- No, no thanks.

41:21.948 --> 41:24.159
I suppose after you
digested breakfast...

41:24.160 --> 41:27.548
you'll want to get up on deck and
play a little shuffleboard, right?

41:30.624 --> 41:34.213
This war must be inconvenient
for you, Mr. Holden?

41:34.214 --> 41:36.046
I try to make the best of.

41:36.047 --> 41:39.801
Yes, and you do, indeed you do.

41:39.802 --> 41:43.097
I know you're not familiar with
the way the functions at sea.

41:43.098 --> 41:45.608
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

41:45.976 --> 41:48.645
But here we all...

41:48.646 --> 41:51.106
We all eat and work together...

41:51.107 --> 41:55.124
and so you won't upset that system,
You will have to do it our way.

41:55.153 --> 41:58.281
You've got three minutes to
get off your fat mattress...

41:58.282 --> 42:00.492
- and report to Mr. Watson!
- Yes, sir.

42:00.493 --> 42:03.954
You are going to learn something
if I have to poor it into you!

42:03.955 --> 42:08.168
Another thing: here we dress alike,
Got any regulation trousers?

42:08.169 --> 42:11.421
No, sir. I had all my clothes
made at " Saks " Fifth Avenue.

42:11.422 --> 42:14.218
I can't to do anything about the
uniform, but don't want you to think...

42:14.219 --> 42:17.687
I'll expect breakfast
in bed every morning.

42:18.181 --> 42:20.723
Scuttlebutt is that we will
submerge at daybreak...

42:20.724 --> 42:22.975
and if you gotta go, you
might as well go big.

42:22.976 --> 42:27.029
It is past daybreak
and we are submerged.

42:28.110 --> 42:30.499
- We are?
- Yes.

42:31.237 --> 42:33.546
- You mean we're under??
- Yes.

42:36.367 --> 42:38.660
But it isn't a permanent situation?

42:38.661 --> 42:41.039
I mean, we can up if we'd like to?

42:41.040 --> 42:44.927
Well, I'd like to think we can.
But I'm an incurable optimist.

42:47.047 --> 42:49.342
What happens, sir, if...?

42:49.343 --> 42:51.980
What happens if we can not...?

42:53.929 --> 42:55.596
If we can not...

42:55.597 --> 42:57.397
Then...

42:58.809 --> 43:02.522
- What kind of answer is that?
- Why? Nervous, Mr. Holden?

43:02.523 --> 43:04.191
Yes.

43:04.192 --> 43:07.544
Tell me something:
Why did you join the navy?

43:07.571 --> 43:10.294
Because I needed an
officer's uniform.

43:10.406 --> 43:13.908
As a kid I was a victim of the
most vicious propaganda;...

43:13.909 --> 43:17.247
people told me... that money was
not everything, and I believed it.

43:17.248 --> 43:19.500
Until I found out
that people saying...

43:19.501 --> 43:21.960
"money is not everything"
were the ones who had it.

43:21.961 --> 43:24.922
I figured they were trying
to hide a good thing.

43:24.923 --> 43:26.800
Sir, please sit down.

43:26.801 --> 43:28.481
Yes.

43:31.348 --> 43:34.391
Now there are two simple
ways to make money:..

43:34.392 --> 43:37.115
You can steal it, or
you can marry it.

43:37.147 --> 43:40.275
To marry it, you have to
travel in the right circles...

43:40.276 --> 43:42.026
on the right side of the tracks.

43:42.027 --> 43:43.278
Two things I learned:

43:43.279 --> 43:46.865
One: A uniform can take you
to the best places, and two:..

43:46.866 --> 43:50.328
No one ever checks Dun and
Bradstreet in a bedroom.

43:50.329 --> 43:52.495
It sounds like a
winning combination.

43:52.496 --> 43:54.592
Would you like to see the jackpot?

43:55.791 --> 43:59.003
That the girl from the
right side of the tracks?

43:59.004 --> 44:00.671
She owns the tracks...

44:00.672 --> 44:05.438
or 5.2 % of all the
railroad stock in America.

44:05.595 --> 44:07.181
Isn't she lovely?

44:07.182 --> 44:11.310
We had a dinner date one night,
and I was a few minutes late...

44:11.311 --> 44:13.474
and she didn't want
it to happen again.

44:14.020 --> 44:16.606
Have you ever seen a two
thousand dollar watch?

44:16.607 --> 44:18.537
My, my, my.

44:18.569 --> 44:22.835
When the minister says " will you take
this woman? " He won't be kidding.

44:23.075 --> 44:26.410
- When is the happy occasion?
- The day I get back.

44:26.411 --> 44:30.039
You see that I get back and I'll
see you have a private submarine.

44:30.040 --> 44:31.839
For heaven's sake.

44:36.631 --> 44:38.507
Excuse me.

44:38.508 --> 44:41.385
Is this normal or should
I be nervous again?

44:41.386 --> 44:43.264
- Captain!
- Yes.

44:43.265 --> 44:45.474
One of our connections
carried away, sir...

44:45.475 --> 44:48.234
We're rigging a patch, but I
don't think it will hold.

44:49.771 --> 44:53.108
- Prepare to surface.
- Stand by to surface. Lookouts to conning tower.

44:53.109 --> 44:54.567
Stand by to surface.
Lookouts to conning tower.

44:54.568 --> 44:56.944
- How much time for repairs?
- About six hours...

44:56.945 --> 44:59.739
- ...if we can work over the side.
- Six hours...

44:59.740 --> 45:03.494
The nearest place with a
sheltered anchorage is.

45:03.495 --> 45:05.248
- Marinduque island. We better head there.
- Okay.

45:05.249 --> 45:06.456
- Watch your fault.
- Yes, sir.

45:06.457 --> 45:09.016
All free, sir. Sound the alarm.

45:10.795 --> 45:13.421
22 December, 1941.

45:13.422 --> 45:17.261
Arrived Marinduque two hours
after enemy air raid.

45:17.262 --> 45:20.556
Repairs have to be completed
before their next visit.

45:20.557 --> 45:22.933
To get Lt. Holden out
from underfoot...

45:22.934 --> 45:27.153
I sent him and his men
to scout the island.

45:31.527 --> 45:33.954
- Captain.
- Yes.

45:34.114 --> 45:35.865
Mr. Holden is coming back, sir.

45:35.866 --> 45:39.218
War is hell, Mr. Watson.

45:39.788 --> 45:42.465
Not only that, sir.

45:42.707 --> 45:45.052
Wait until you see what
he's got with him.

46:09.489 --> 46:10.655
Women!

46:10.656 --> 46:14.341
Wow! That's what I call scavenging!

46:16.205 --> 46:18.165
I... What I meant sir is...

46:18.166 --> 46:21.293
I'm sure there will be something
they can be used for.

46:21.294 --> 46:25.006
I can think of many uses,
but not here and now.

46:25.007 --> 46:29.344
Mr. Stovall, the influence of Lt.
Holden is beginning to worry me.

46:29.345 --> 46:33.278
I suggest you "Wow!" less
and "Tsk Tsk Tsk" more...

46:53.830 --> 46:56.804
- Mayor Heywood.
- Major Heywood.

46:58.461 --> 47:01.435
- Lieutenant Duran.
- Lieutenant Duran.

47:02.592 --> 47:05.351
- Lieutenant Reid.
- Lieutenant.

47:06.513 --> 47:08.656
Lieutenant. Colfax.

47:09.016 --> 47:10.646
Lieutenant.

47:11.934 --> 47:14.078
Lieutenant Crandall.

47:16.690 --> 47:19.783
If anyone asks what
you're fighting for...

47:19.819 --> 47:21.749
there's your answer.

47:25.993 --> 47:28.954
Lt. Holden invited
us to go with you.

47:28.955 --> 47:30.080
What?

47:30.081 --> 47:32.457
The Major and her unit
were stranded, sir.

47:32.458 --> 47:35.002
We were en route to Manila and
heard it was being bombed...

47:35.003 --> 47:37.422
- ...and we had to land here.
- Oh.

47:37.423 --> 47:39.800
The Japanese strafed
the airstrip and...

47:39.801 --> 47:42.552
our plane took off to keep from
being destroyed on the ground.

47:42.553 --> 47:44.181
He was supposed to
come back for us.

47:44.182 --> 47:45.765
- Alright.
- It didn't make it.

47:45.766 --> 47:48.768
They were the only Americans
on the island, sir...

47:48.769 --> 47:50.937
You could not possibly
leave them there.

47:50.938 --> 47:52.148
Thank you.

47:52.149 --> 47:55.834
- It's an emergency, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Holden.

47:55.944 --> 48:00.615
Now, Major, obviously we have to get
out of here as fast as we can, so...

48:00.616 --> 48:03.452
if you'll get your party
below, I'll get you to Cebu...

48:03.453 --> 48:05.496
where you can rejoin an Army unit.

48:05.497 --> 48:08.751
- Escort the Major to the wardroom.
- Yes, sir.

48:08.752 --> 48:09.792
Thank you, Lieutenant.

48:09.793 --> 48:12.351
- Thank you, ma'am.
- This way, ladies.

48:16.468 --> 48:18.761
- I guess I'm stuck.
- Yes.

48:18.762 --> 48:22.448
Just a minute.
Come on. That's right.

48:23.017 --> 48:26.490
- Thank you very much.
- Suggest you take the other one off.

48:33.196 --> 48:34.695
Sir.

48:34.696 --> 48:36.115
Mr. Holden, just a minute.

48:36.116 --> 48:38.958
- Mr. Watson!
- Yes, sir?

48:39.912 --> 48:41.621
Please assemble the crew.

48:41.622 --> 48:45.668
Instruct them to ignore that
our passengers are women.

48:45.669 --> 48:47.420
That may require some...

48:47.421 --> 48:50.963
readjustment... but I want
every man to understand...

48:50.964 --> 48:53.467
our objective is Cebu
and then Darwin.

48:53.468 --> 48:56.222
If any man has any other
objective in mind...

48:56.223 --> 48:57.722
he'd better forget it.

48:57.723 --> 48:59.891
You will put on report...

48:59.892 --> 49:01.775
Collision!

49:02.854 --> 49:04.857
- Collision, sir!
- Really...

49:04.858 --> 49:07.118
we're not even moving.

49:13.283 --> 49:15.659
- Who hit the collision button?
- I do not know, sir.

49:15.660 --> 49:19.513
Everything has a reason
for being here...

49:20.041 --> 49:22.252
- What happened?
- I'm very sorry.

49:22.253 --> 49:25.872
I was coming down the ladder and
accidentally touched that button.

49:25.873 --> 49:26.873
She grabbed the collision alarm.

49:26.874 --> 49:28.143
Just a minute.

49:28.383 --> 49:31.720
Please, ladies, there is one
primary rule you must observe:..

49:31.721 --> 49:34.430
Keep your hands...
and... you're, uh...

49:34.431 --> 49:36.684
Just do not touch anything.

49:36.685 --> 49:40.731
The ladies will occupy the
Chief's quarters and my cabin.

49:40.732 --> 49:45.628
The Chiefs move out with the men. Move my
gear with Watson and you stay with Holden.

49:45.780 --> 49:47.626
Now, uh...

49:48.074 --> 49:51.493
For the next few days we'll
be living in close contact...

49:51.494 --> 49:53.287
and you being women... and...

49:53.288 --> 49:58.052
the crew being men,
being confined could...

49:58.212 --> 50:00.753
could create situations...
not usually...

50:00.754 --> 50:03.764
consistent with normal
submarine operations.

50:04.635 --> 50:07.138
- What I mean to say.
- We know what you mean, Captain.

50:07.139 --> 50:09.181
We're well acquainted
with the facts of life.

50:09.182 --> 50:13.114
So are the men. I'm just trying to
avoid any exchange of information.

50:15.438 --> 50:17.201
You must...

50:17.233 --> 50:18.732
You must realize that...

50:18.733 --> 50:22.114
submarines are not designed
to be coeducational.

50:22.115 --> 50:23.913
That is to say...

50:25.659 --> 50:28.912
Mr. Stovall, take the
ladies to the wardroom.

50:28.913 --> 50:31.885
- I'll try to work out a schedule.
- Yes, sir.

50:34.836 --> 50:37.179
You'll eat in the officers' mess.

50:37.297 --> 50:42.191
Mealtimes are 7:00,
12:00 and 18:00.

50:42.762 --> 50:45.098
Now, this is the shower.

50:45.099 --> 50:46.482
Excuse me.

50:46.725 --> 50:48.892
Instructions are on the bulkhead.

50:48.893 --> 50:52.605
Your shower period
will be 6:30 to 6:50.

50:52.606 --> 50:54.982
You will each have a
minute and a half.

50:54.983 --> 50:56.902
A minute and a half?

50:56.903 --> 51:00.073
Captain 's orders, there are
problems with fresh water supply.

51:00.074 --> 51:01.907
How can you shower in
a minute and a half?

51:01.908 --> 51:05.204
What you miss one day you can
get the next time around.

51:05.205 --> 51:09.305
In here is what we
in the Navy call...

51:11.960 --> 51:14.713
It's operated by means of the
air compression levers...

51:14.714 --> 51:17.936
What do they call it?

51:18.803 --> 51:22.359
The head.

51:22.975 --> 51:27.788
I've drawn a complete diagram.
I'm sure you will have no trouble.

51:36.950 --> 51:39.341
Why do they call it the head?

51:39.870 --> 51:41.669
Doesn't say.

51:43.167 --> 51:45.541
A woman on board is
bad luck, sir...

51:45.542 --> 51:48.003
and if one is bad
luck, imagine five.

51:48.004 --> 51:51.299
Alright, what do you want me to do?
Throw them overboard?

51:51.300 --> 51:53.524
It 's something to think about.

51:56.013 --> 51:58.571
Do what you can, okay?

51:59.643 --> 52:01.352
Hunkle, what 's going on in there?

52:01.353 --> 52:03.520
It's a raffle, they're
drawing for the women.

52:03.521 --> 52:04.772
They're drawing for the women?

52:04.773 --> 52:08.328
Mr. Holden organized it. They're
picking the five lucky men now.

52:09.903 --> 52:11.453
Kraus.

52:12.449 --> 52:15.576
Congratulations.
What did you give away?

52:15.577 --> 52:17.328
- What's going on?
- A raffle, sir.

52:17.329 --> 52:18.663
What kind of raffle?

52:18.664 --> 52:21.959
- For clothing.
- Clothes?

52:21.960 --> 52:24.754
Yes. The men are donating
their clothes to the women.

52:24.755 --> 52:26.922
- Have you men finished chow?
- Yes, sir.

52:26.923 --> 52:30.477
Then back on the job. We
have to get out of here.

52:30.510 --> 52:32.522
- Mr. Holden.
- Yes, sir.

52:35.308 --> 52:37.643
How did all that get started?

52:37.644 --> 52:40.314
I thought I was boosting
the men's morale, sir...

52:40.315 --> 52:42.649
after all there's a
practical side ;...

52:42.650 --> 52:45.153
these women have been on an
island for quite a while...

52:45.154 --> 52:46.987
their clothes are all messed up.

52:46.988 --> 52:50.158
Sooner or later they will
have to wash them...

52:50.159 --> 52:54.710
With everything hanging on the
line and nothing hanging on the...

52:55.456 --> 52:57.930
You see, sir, it could
be rather awkward.

53:01.255 --> 53:02.887
Yes.

53:04.342 --> 53:07.564
- Carry on, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

53:17.274 --> 53:20.330
I wish I had a decent mirror.

53:22.072 --> 53:24.614
Why the Navy still use
that silly clasp?

53:24.615 --> 53:26.617
We just found out it's tradition...

53:26.618 --> 53:29.786
each button represents one of
the original thirteen states.

53:29.787 --> 53:32.381
Well you better
button up New Jersey.

53:32.791 --> 53:35.710
- How's the shirt?
- A little tight.

53:35.711 --> 53:39.349
I'd better reinforce those buttons
before you take a deep breath.

53:39.424 --> 53:42.268
The Navy's got to have
some thread, come on.

53:52.688 --> 53:54.404
- Hello.
- Hi.

53:57.195 --> 53:58.361
What's wrong?

53:58.362 --> 54:01.157
Kraus does absolutely
nothing for you.

54:01.158 --> 54:04.827
You don't put the crown
jewels in a paper bag. Come.

54:04.828 --> 54:06.592
Where are we going?

54:11.502 --> 54:13.712
But I 'm happy with these pants.

54:13.713 --> 54:15.631
Barbara, they just won't do.

54:15.632 --> 54:16.924
Let me see.

54:16.925 --> 54:20.596
- They're not uncomfortable.
- Barbara, will you stop being nervous?

54:20.597 --> 54:23.016
- I'm not nervous.
- Well, of course you're nervous.

54:23.017 --> 54:26.061
This is part of my job;
I'm your Supply Officer.

54:26.062 --> 54:29.606
- But I do not need...
- 35-22-34?

54:29.607 --> 54:32.198
Then you've got these
supplies before.

54:32.568 --> 54:34.663
Let's see...

54:35.321 --> 54:36.947
" Shorts ". Do you play tennis?

54:36.948 --> 54:40.285
- Well, I...
- Here's a tennis sweater...

54:40.286 --> 54:42.084
a shirt...

54:42.205 --> 54:44.372
a nice robe, clean...

54:44.373 --> 54:46.626
and also a pair of pyjamas.

54:46.627 --> 54:48.934
- Well, I...
- Excuse me.

54:49.088 --> 54:50.434
Hello.

54:51.257 --> 54:53.932
Stovall, aren't you on watch?

54:55.302 --> 54:57.804
Yes. I was just on my way up.

54:57.805 --> 54:59.515
Excuse me.

54:59.516 --> 55:01.031
Good night.

55:01.977 --> 55:04.202
Now where were we? Oh yes.

55:04.273 --> 55:06.948
I think you ought to
try these on for size.

55:07.025 --> 55:11.070
Lieutenant, I appreciate the offer
but I can not take your pyjamas.

55:11.071 --> 55:12.362
Why not?

55:12.363 --> 55:15.909
Well frankly, it's a
little embarrassing.

55:15.910 --> 55:19.547
A girl does not get
into any man's pyjamas.

55:19.665 --> 55:22.000
If the man's not in
them, what's the harm?

55:22.001 --> 55:24.224
And what are you going to sleep in?

55:25.922 --> 55:28.258
All right, we'll compromise:..

55:28.259 --> 55:30.602
I'll take the bottoms...

55:30.717 --> 55:32.053
And you can have the tops...

55:32.054 --> 55:35.407
- unless you prefer...
- The top will be fine.

55:37.434 --> 55:39.779
What else can I give you?

55:42.524 --> 55:43.775
Champagne.

55:43.776 --> 55:47.497
- Under the heading of supplies, too?
- No.

55:48.406 --> 55:51.212
You see, I am also Morale Officer.

55:51.993 --> 55:54.829
You know, it's against regulations
to have this on board.

55:54.830 --> 55:57.886
If we do not drink it,
I will have to pour it out.

55:58.375 --> 56:01.420
All we need is a couple
of glasses and some ice.

56:01.421 --> 56:03.463
- Now look, we can't...
- Ramon!

56:03.464 --> 56:05.096
Yes, sir?

56:06.177 --> 56:07.773
- Thank you.
- Hello.

56:08.888 --> 56:10.520
Good night.

56:11.224 --> 56:13.392
I'm ready to relieve you, sir.

56:13.393 --> 56:15.353
You're an hour early, Mr. Stovall.

56:15.354 --> 56:18.410
I couldn't sleep and figured
I might as well come up.

56:19.067 --> 56:21.026
Where are your binoculars?

56:21.027 --> 56:22.318
In my room.

56:22.319 --> 56:25.707
- Okay, carry on. I'll send them up.
- No, I'll go get them, sir.

56:26.116 --> 56:29.868
- You've just relieved Mr. Watson.
- But you can't do that.

56:29.869 --> 56:31.881
And why can't I do that?

56:31.997 --> 56:35.304
- Well, because...
- Just what can't I do?

56:35.585 --> 56:38.047
- Go to the room.
- Why I can't I go to the room?

56:38.048 --> 56:41.299
Because Mr. Holden is sleeping.

56:41.300 --> 56:45.804
- I'll try not to wake him.
- No! I mean, is, that he...

56:45.805 --> 56:49.858
- He has company.
- He's sleeping and he has company?

57:03.450 --> 57:05.795
- Hello.
- Hello.

57:05.953 --> 57:07.370
What are we celebrating?

57:07.371 --> 57:11.805
Lieutenant Holden was just
giving me his clothes.

57:12.128 --> 57:16.891
That's worth drinking to, but
unfortunately regulations...

57:17.050 --> 57:19.857
Right. I think I'd better be going.

57:22.140 --> 57:23.431
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

57:23.432 --> 57:25.860
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

57:29.148 --> 57:32.316
- Where did you pick up the champagne?
- Captain Henderson's office.

57:32.317 --> 57:35.028
I thought it was better
that he keep a clear head.

57:35.029 --> 57:37.254
Very thoughtful of you.

57:37.823 --> 57:41.785
Now I have this unreasonable
desire to get back in the war.

57:41.786 --> 57:42.828
Yes, I know, sir.

57:42.829 --> 57:46.416
I'd prefer to do it as captain of a
fighting ship not a cocktail bar.

57:46.417 --> 57:47.584
As of this moment the
cocktail lounge...

57:47.585 --> 57:49.337
- ...is closed, sir.
- Yes.

57:49.338 --> 57:52.215
- No customers after hours.
- Absolutely not.

57:52.216 --> 57:54.144
Fine.

58:05.647 --> 58:07.872
That's the idea.

58:13.322 --> 58:14.789
Kraus.

58:15.367 --> 58:16.450
Yes?

58:16.451 --> 58:18.796
Which one touched your clothes?

58:18.955 --> 58:22.331
I don't know. But I sure hope
it's the one with the big...

58:22.332 --> 58:25.460
- Knock it off.
- What's the matter with you?

58:25.461 --> 58:27.379
Quit talking about her that way.

58:27.380 --> 58:29.725
- She's a woman.
- So?

58:31.009 --> 58:33.734
- Well my mother is a woman.
- So?

58:35.224 --> 58:38.363
I do not know, it just all
seems to tie in somehow.

58:52.284 --> 58:54.036
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

58:54.037 --> 58:56.622
I'm having a little trouble.
I can't get it to work...

58:56.623 --> 58:59.466
I think there is something
wrong with that shower head.

59:02.213 --> 59:03.505
- Try this.
- Captain...

59:03.506 --> 59:07.008
I'd like to apologize for setting
off the collision alarm.

59:07.009 --> 59:10.304
That's all right. Tell me, did
you follow the instructions?

59:10.305 --> 59:12.723
Yes, I turned this knob

59:12.724 --> 59:14.185
and this one...

59:14.186 --> 59:16.696
and then this.

59:21.318 --> 59:24.279
- At least I think that's what I did.
- Yes, that's what you did.

59:24.280 --> 59:26.365
- Oh dear.
- That's okay.

59:26.366 --> 59:29.719
- Let me dry you off.
- No, please.

59:30.744 --> 59:33.414
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

59:33.415 --> 59:36.085
That's a clever shower schedule
you've got worked out, sir.

59:36.086 --> 59:38.171
Conserves water, too.

59:38.172 --> 59:41.757
- Lt. Crandall was having difficulty.
- Sir, it's your boat.

59:41.758 --> 59:43.439
Excuse me.

59:46.181 --> 59:50.059
It's just as well it didn't work.
I left my dusting powder in my room.

59:50.060 --> 59:53.604
- Your dusting powder.
- Would you hold that for me? Be right back.

59:53.605 --> 59:55.948
Terrible.

59:58.444 --> 59:59.611
Good morning, sir.

59:59.612 --> 01:00:01.114
- Good morning.
- Can I get you anything?

01:00:01.115 --> 01:00:03.459
- Yes, anything.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:07.039 --> 01:00:09.498
- My dusting powder.
- I see.

01:00:09.499 --> 01:00:12.091
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.421
- Wait, Captain. Sir!
- What is it?

01:00:15.422 --> 01:00:17.507
There's a woman in my engine room.

01:00:17.508 --> 01:00:20.009
- You have to get her out.
- Who?

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:23.973
The Major. She washed her clothes
and hung them there to dry.

01:00:23.974 --> 01:00:27.103
It's bad luck to have a
woman in the engine room.

01:00:27.104 --> 01:00:29.522
Tostin, what harm can
their clothes do?

01:00:29.523 --> 01:00:31.897
That's when they're
dangerous, like snakes...

01:00:31.898 --> 01:00:33.608
when they shed their
skin... look out.

01:00:33.609 --> 01:00:36.029
Can I have my scrubber please?

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:37.280
Yes, here you go.

01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:39.790
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:00:40.534 --> 01:00:43.162
Tostin, they have to dry
their clothes somewhere...

01:00:43.163 --> 01:00:45.832
and yours is the most logical place.
Deal with it as best you can.

01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:48.640
- Yes, Captain.
- Carry on.

01:01:02.102 --> 01:01:05.490
- Sailor.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:01:07.024 --> 01:01:09.151
Tell me when these are dry.

01:01:09.152 --> 01:01:12.112
I'm a machinist mate, I ain't a...

01:01:12.113 --> 01:01:14.198
laundry sailor.

01:01:14.199 --> 01:01:16.909
- Sailor.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.911
Please try not to knock
anything down...

01:01:18.912 --> 01:01:21.873
I wouldn't want it to
land on this dirty floor.

01:01:21.874 --> 01:01:25.844
- What's dirty?
- The whole engine room.

01:01:29.633 --> 01:01:31.259
Look at that grease.

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.638
If you was bombed and sunk
and pulled up by your stern...

01:01:34.639 --> 01:01:37.112
you'd be a little greasy too.

01:01:51.992 --> 01:01:53.202
Sailor.

01:01:53.203 --> 01:01:55.495
- Lady!
- You'll never get it to work that way.

01:01:55.496 --> 01:01:58.497
Why don't you go and
roll some bandages?

01:01:58.498 --> 01:02:01.626
- What do you know about machinery?
- I was raised with it.

01:02:01.627 --> 01:02:05.433
My father was Chief Engineer
at the Seattle power plant.

01:02:07.761 --> 01:02:10.553
That would work if you'd
install a new valve spring.

01:02:10.554 --> 01:02:12.555
My father was a Chief Engineer...

01:02:12.556 --> 01:02:16.601
I'm trying to make do with something
that doesn't belong on a submarine...

01:02:16.602 --> 01:02:21.108
and you can't install a new valve
spring if you ain't got it.

01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:23.236
Now, will you get out of here?

01:02:23.237 --> 01:02:25.446
You're talking to an officer.

01:02:25.447 --> 01:02:29.035
Maybe Congress made you an officer,
but God made you a woman...

01:02:29.036 --> 01:02:32.079
and a woman shouldn't mess
around with a man's machinery.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.839
For the last time,
get out, will you?

01:02:39.463 --> 01:02:41.882
Good morning, sir. Can I
pour you a cup of coffee?

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:44.009
- Never mind, I'll attend to it. Go and shower.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:47.102
- Have the women finished breakfast?
- Yes, sir.

01:03:14.587 --> 01:03:16.516
Pardon me.

01:03:19.634 --> 01:03:23.771
I left my cigarette here.
Have you seen it?

01:03:26.019 --> 01:03:27.781
Perhaps?

01:03:30.147 --> 01:03:32.107
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:35.578
Oh, that's alright, Lieutenant.
I enjoy a cigarette with my coffee.

01:03:41.326 --> 01:03:43.588
Oh, thanks.

01:03:47.584 --> 01:03:49.835
Is that all you're
having for breakfast?

01:03:49.836 --> 01:03:53.142
I'm a little nervous.
I don't feel much like eating.

01:03:53.591 --> 01:03:57.510
Captain, I hope you do not mind a
little professional advice but...

01:03:57.511 --> 01:04:00.306
when a person is nervous
and irritable...

01:04:00.307 --> 01:04:02.975
you can be assured that something
is missing in their life.

01:04:02.976 --> 01:04:05.603
- Vitamins and minerals.
- Vitamins and minerals.

01:04:05.604 --> 01:04:09.317
With an appropriate nutritional balance,
you wouldn't have any gray hair.

01:04:09.318 --> 01:04:12.945
I like having gray hair, so I
can worry without it showing.

01:04:12.946 --> 01:04:15.822
- I used to be just like you.
- What, gray hair?

01:04:15.823 --> 01:04:19.577
- No. I was run down and poor appetite.
- Yes?

01:04:19.578 --> 01:04:22.498
Then I started taking these
pills that I have here...

01:04:22.499 --> 01:04:25.210
- ...and they really built me up.
- No question about it.

01:04:25.211 --> 01:04:27.587
All you have to do is take
one every three hours.

01:04:27.588 --> 01:04:30.883
You are very kind,
I appreciate the offer...

01:04:30.884 --> 01:04:34.137
- ...but I'm busy man and would forget.
- I'll remind you.

01:04:34.138 --> 01:04:36.931
You're the Captain and it would
be bad if you got sick too.

01:04:36.932 --> 01:04:38.141
Sick too!

01:04:38.142 --> 01:04:39.810
Who's sick?

01:04:39.811 --> 01:04:43.827
Most of the men. Lieutenants Colfax
and Reid are taking care of them.

01:04:44.983 --> 01:04:47.909
Lt. Crandall, excuse me.

01:04:50.948 --> 01:04:53.449
- You look pretty good to me.
- I don't feel so good.

01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:56.745
- Stomach, and I feel dizzy.
- Hold still.

01:04:56.746 --> 01:04:59.456
Lie down over there.

01:04:59.457 --> 01:05:01.304
Keep that under your tongue.

01:05:01.376 --> 01:05:04.470
- All right.
- Just go over there.

01:05:05.507 --> 01:05:07.217
Right. Now, what's
the matter with you?

01:05:07.218 --> 01:05:09.969
- Williams.
- I've got a headache and my back hurts...

01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:11.637
What's wrong?

01:05:11.638 --> 01:05:14.890
I don't know, sir. I feel terrible.

01:05:14.891 --> 01:05:16.773
You smell good.

01:05:17.562 --> 01:05:19.194
What about you, Harmon?

01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:21.566
I have shooting pains
in my head, sir.

01:05:21.567 --> 01:05:25.205
- Probably fumes from that hair tonic.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:26.615 --> 01:05:29.884
And you, Fox. What have you got on?

01:05:30.036 --> 01:05:32.509
It's called " Surrender ", sir.

01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:34.872
My mother sent it to me.

01:05:34.873 --> 01:05:39.640
Break it up. Neutralize that
cologne with a some perspiration.

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:50.307
Even our pharmacist's mate.

01:05:50.308 --> 01:05:52.185
What's the matter, Dooley?

01:05:52.186 --> 01:05:53.852
- He seems to have...
- Just a minute.

01:05:53.853 --> 01:05:55.562
I don't know, sir.

01:05:55.563 --> 01:05:58.372
I only hope I can last the day out.

01:06:00.029 --> 01:06:02.086
Up, Dooley!

01:06:03.406 --> 01:06:07.710
Thank you, ladies. We won't be needing
you any more. The epidemic is over.

01:06:12.415 --> 01:06:15.481
- Lieutenant Crandall.
- You forgot your vitamins.

01:06:15.482 --> 01:06:16.441
Thank you very much.

01:06:16.442 --> 01:06:18.736
I'll remind you when it's
time for the next one.

01:06:18.737 --> 01:06:20.168
Yes.

01:06:23.242 --> 01:06:24.838
Sir.

01:06:33.211 --> 01:06:35.472
Lieutenant Crandall, I...

01:06:38.802 --> 01:06:40.510
- Mr. Watson.
- Yes, sir?

01:06:40.511 --> 01:06:43.931
Pass the word to the crew. When Lt.
Crandall... you know Lt. Crandall?

01:06:43.932 --> 01:06:48.313
When Lt. Crandall walks through any
part of the boat, give clear passage.

01:06:48.314 --> 01:06:51.482
- Right, sir.
- How's Mr. Holden coming with the torpedoes?

01:06:51.483 --> 01:06:55.154
I decided he would make better headway if
he read the basic submarine manual first.

01:06:55.155 --> 01:06:57.795
- It's in his cabin reading.
- Good.

01:06:58.034 --> 01:07:00.326
- Am I going down right?
- That's right.

01:07:00.327 --> 01:07:02.912
- Is she going down right?
- She sure is.

01:07:02.913 --> 01:07:04.789
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:08.926
Mr. Holden is explaining
how everything works.

01:07:09.879 --> 01:07:13.589
- He's been explaining?
- We're just on our way to the engine room.

01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:16.803
I 'm afraid Mr. Holden won't be
able to maneuver this morning.

01:07:16.804 --> 01:07:20.515
- Don't you have a book to read?
- Yes, I'm on Chapter Five:..

01:07:20.516 --> 01:07:22.893
- "Care and Operation of the Bilge Pump"
- All right.

01:07:22.894 --> 01:07:24.478
I can't wait to see
how it turns out.

01:07:24.479 --> 01:07:27.692
You'll like it. It turns out happily;
they get each other in the end.

01:07:27.693 --> 01:07:29.317
Engine Room to Captain.

01:07:29.318 --> 01:07:30.611
What is it, Tostin?

01:07:30.612 --> 01:07:33.446
Either her or me in
this engine room!

01:07:33.447 --> 01:07:35.424
I'll be right there.

01:07:38.061 --> 01:07:41.231
It works. You're just to
stubborn to admit it.

01:07:41.232 --> 01:07:44.240
Get that thing out
of my engine room!

01:07:48.073 --> 01:07:51.658
- Look, Major... enough is enough...
- What's going on?

01:07:51.659 --> 01:07:52.994
Look at what she did, sir.

01:07:52.995 --> 01:07:55.497
It's only temporary until
we make a valve spring.

01:07:55.498 --> 01:07:59.251
- We?? What do you mean we??
- I will design it and you can make it up.

01:07:59.252 --> 01:08:01.170
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

01:08:01.171 --> 01:08:03.215
What are you going to do, sir?

01:08:03.216 --> 01:08:05.008
I don't know. It works, doesn't it?

01:08:05.009 --> 01:08:08.054
But I'm here all day and that
thing going up and down...

01:08:08.055 --> 01:08:10.232
- ...that's indecent.
- Well.

01:08:11.182 --> 01:08:14.267
- Engine room. Is the Captain there?
- What is it, Molumphry?

01:08:14.268 --> 01:08:17.399
- Better come up to the yeoman's office, sir.
- What's wrong?

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:20.233
Lieutenant Reid just hit Hunkle.

01:08:20.234 --> 01:08:23.872
Hit Hunkle? I'll be right there.
Hit Hunkle.

01:08:23.947 --> 01:08:27.835
- What are you to do about her?
- Keep an eye on it, Tostin.

01:08:28.118 --> 01:08:30.203
I'm sure it wasn't
intentional, ma'am.

01:08:30.205 --> 01:08:34.175
I know, but I've never seen
anything like that in a man.

01:08:36.085 --> 01:08:37.933
Mr. Hunkle?

01:08:40.048 --> 01:08:41.884
I'm sorry.

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:43.470
That's all right, Lieutenant.

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:45.639
- Sir.
- What happened?

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.890
- It was nothing, really.
- Then why did you hit him?

01:08:47.892 --> 01:08:50.350
It was my fault, sir,
I was changing my shirt...

01:08:50.352 --> 01:08:54.189
- I went to borrow the typewriter.
- I had my shirt off and she hit me.

01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:58.955
It was a reflex action.
I was embarrassed and I...

01:08:59.154 --> 01:09:01.212
If you'll excuse me.

01:09:02.576 --> 01:09:06.037
Hunkle, keep that pinup covered,
I've got enough troubles.

01:09:06.037 --> 01:09:08.622
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, torpedo room calling the Captain.

01:09:08.624 --> 01:09:11.125
- What is it, Harmon?
- What do I do with Lt. Colfax?

01:09:11.126 --> 01:09:12.460
What's wrong?

01:09:12.461 --> 01:09:16.256
She's dizzy, sir. I think she's getting seasick.
She insists she's got the bends.

01:09:16.256 --> 01:09:18.233
I'll be right there.

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:31.120
- Excuse me, please.
- Yes.

01:09:39.536 --> 01:09:42.627
It's amazing how
compact everything is.

01:09:43.499 --> 01:09:47.432
On a sub you have to
operate in close quarters.

01:09:48.754 --> 01:09:51.642
- I think we better be going.
- Going where?

01:09:51.965 --> 01:09:54.892
Well, Nick, haven't you
got some reading to do?

01:09:55.719 --> 01:09:57.471
How old are you, Barbara?

01:09:57.472 --> 01:09:58.931
Twenty-four.

01:09:58.932 --> 01:10:03.645
A very nervous twenty-four.
Look at yourself. You're tense.

01:10:03.646 --> 01:10:06.899
Your pulse is beating fast
and your hands are cold.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.541
We've got to do something
about all this tension.

01:10:09.653 --> 01:10:12.744
I'm afraid that the cure might
be worse than the disease.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:16.467
Barbara, you're a nurse, you
know it is with people.

01:10:17.996 --> 01:10:19.842
They're like that teapot;...

01:10:20.165 --> 01:10:23.637
build a fire under it,
pressure builds...

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:26.312
and has to be relieved.

01:10:39.479 --> 01:10:42.404
- Mr. Holden, return to your quarters.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:44.986 --> 01:10:47.448
Captain, it wasn't his fault...

01:10:47.449 --> 01:10:49.407
I encouraged him.

01:10:49.408 --> 01:10:50.615
Lieutenant...

01:10:50.616 --> 01:10:54.549
the last thing the men on this
boat need is encouragement.

01:10:55.914 --> 01:10:59.849
Major, if you can't control
your women, lock them up.

01:11:04.132 --> 01:11:05.646
What happened?

01:11:05.968 --> 01:11:07.564
He caught us.

01:11:08.137 --> 01:11:09.818
Doing what?

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.111
Nick kissed me.

01:11:12.933 --> 01:11:14.910
- Oh?
- And I kissed him back.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:20.034
Don't you think you're
rushing things?

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:23.325
Love underwater is fine
for a fish, but...

01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:26.130
shouldn't you wait until
you come up for air?

01:11:28.619 --> 01:11:32.090
Major, my mother had a very
simple outlook on life.

01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:35.250
She always said: "never worry
about getting married...

01:11:35.251 --> 01:11:38.556
someday you'll turn the right
corner and meet the right man."

01:11:38.755 --> 01:11:40.637
It isn't that easy.

01:11:40.883 --> 01:11:43.774
I've been turning corners
for twenty-four years.

01:11:44.178 --> 01:11:47.474
You know, I think I finally
turned the right one?

01:11:47.475 --> 01:11:51.435
Why go back out in that
crowd and get lost again?

01:11:51.436 --> 01:11:55.440
Baby, if you're right, I'm in
more trouble than I figured.

01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:57.916
You're 24 and I'm 38.

01:11:57.944 --> 01:12:01.085
You know, I might not be able
to make it to the next corner?

01:12:01.198 --> 01:12:02.240
Mister...

01:12:02.241 --> 01:12:06.580
You've used that uniform for everything
but what the government intended.

01:12:06.581 --> 01:12:08.664
Why you got the uniform
is your concern...

01:12:08.665 --> 01:12:11.124
but what it does on this
boat is my business.

01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:15.087
From here on, if that uniform leaves
this cabin, don't be in it.

01:12:15.088 --> 01:12:17.019
You're confined to quarters.

01:12:18.427 --> 01:12:21.315
- Battle stations!
- Goodbye!

01:12:33.943 --> 01:12:36.788
Boy oh boy.

01:12:39.367 --> 01:12:41.760
A sitting duck, sir.

01:12:44.665 --> 01:12:46.542
A tanker.

01:12:46.543 --> 01:12:47.750
A beaut.

01:12:47.751 --> 01:12:49.670
Eight thousand tons at least.

01:12:49.671 --> 01:12:53.007
She's riding low, sir.
That means she's still loaded.

01:12:53.008 --> 01:12:55.427
Number three tube is operable, sir.

01:12:55.428 --> 01:12:57.820
All we need is one shot.

01:12:57.847 --> 01:13:01.484
This boat wasn't meant
to be a virgin, sir.

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:08.990
Eight thousand tons.

01:13:11.529 --> 01:13:14.834
Let's go duck hunting.
Down scope.

01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:19.835
- Load torpedo tube three.
- Load torpedo tube three.

01:13:30.174 --> 01:13:33.777
- Bearing. Mark.
- Zero-two-six.

01:13:37.975 --> 01:13:41.282
- Range. Mark.
- Two-three-double-oh.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.285
Down scope.

01:13:43.525 --> 01:13:46.067
Fire at 1500 yards.

01:13:46.068 --> 01:13:48.488
Tube number three ready, sir.
Outer door closed.

01:13:48.489 --> 01:13:50.656
Generated range: two-one-double-oh.

01:13:50.657 --> 01:13:54.202
- Open outer door tube three.
- Open outer door tube three.

01:13:54.203 --> 01:13:56.546
Open outer door tube three.

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:05.216
- Tube number three ready, sir.
- One-nine-double-oh.

01:14:05.217 --> 01:14:07.062
Final range.

01:14:17.397 --> 01:14:20.488
- Mark.
- One-eight-double-oh.

01:14:24.489 --> 01:14:28.043
- Stand by tube three.
- Stand by tube three.

01:14:31.539 --> 01:14:35.249
- Captain, it's time for your vitamin.
- Lieutenant, get below.

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.310
Damn it, get below!

01:14:45.178 --> 01:14:47.108
Have I done anything wrong?

01:15:02.157 --> 01:15:04.367

01:15:54.257 --> 01:15:57.344
