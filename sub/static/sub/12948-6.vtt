00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
NARRATOR: Towards the end

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
of the 2008 campaign,

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
GRANDDAD:
What a wonderful surprise,

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
you guys making me brunch.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
the Republican party, terrified at their own

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
TOM:
Well, we're not

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
the chef you are, Robert,

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
sinking poll numbers, attempted to link Barack Obama

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
but we were thinking, "Robert
gives so much to everybody else,

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
someone should give back
to him for a change."

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
to radical leftist figures to make him appear un-American.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
You know, I've often thought
the same thing myself.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Besides, somebody's been losing
a little too much weight.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
First was the controversial Reverend Jeremiah Wright.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
You been hitting the gym?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Well, a little.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
I say motherfuck America,
motherfuck America's mother,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
You know, I do my Tae Bo.
Heh-heh.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Holy shit!
Sarah!

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
motherfuck America's daddy!

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
America can eat a dick!

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Oh, yeah!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
America can lick the balls!

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
When that failed, Republicans tried linking Obama

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
MAN:
I admit, I am envious of you.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Look out!

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
DOOMUS:
Can you tell me your name?

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
RILEY: People call me

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
The Fund-raiser.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
with 10-year-old domestic terrorist Huey Freeman

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
In China, if you lose
$20 billion, they shoot you.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Oh, look out. Come on.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Lamilton.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
My name is Colonel H.
Motherfucking Stinkmeaner.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
And your last name.
Taeshawn.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Oh.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
My glasses.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
after discovering the two were MySpace friends.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
How old are you, Lamilton?
Six.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
They call me that 'cause that's what I do.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Hey!

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Here, they give you another
$20 billion.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Dorothy!
I'm coming, baby!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
And this time I'm rolling deep,
nyukka.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Did they leave each other
glitter comments?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Lamilton, do you know
why you're here?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm coming!

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
The public has
a right to know.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Tom, we gotta get out of here.
But Sarah.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Yes.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I raise funds.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Amusing.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Okay, this is a little boy
who thinks that Jesus is black,

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
You're not taking
Dorothy!

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Our kickball team
is very formidable this year.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
You'll find another white woman.
Just run.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Why are you here?
'Cause I'm a bad kid.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Tom, you punk-ass motherfu--

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
You should have paid
your car note, asshole!

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I get my money up.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Ronald Reagan is the devil

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
That car's been paid for
since 1975!

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
My granddaughter Ming
is the team captain.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I do bad things.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Sweetie pie. No!

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
and the government
is lying about 9/11.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Kids like this need to be
on America's shit list,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
W-W-Wait, wait.
Is this 324 Timid Deer Lane?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
I am hoping it will be
an epic contest.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
The first rule of fundraising

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
is don't give nothing to nobody.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Yo, Lamilton.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
not our friend list.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Hell, no!
This is 327!

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
No offense to your
granddaughter, Mr. Long Do,

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Period.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Obama did his best to downplay the relationship.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
This'll slow them down.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Yo, where you get this?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
No charities, no homeless people,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
That's 324!

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
but our team
shits on your team.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Oh, my God.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I stole my Grandmother's car.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Salvation Army, Red Cross,

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Did you just throw Jazmine?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
starving Africans, nothing.
Hey, brother.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Look, I have many,
many friends on MySpace.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
DOOMUS:
You said you do bad things.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Look out behind you.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
What kind of bad things
do you do?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
You can't be raising funds

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I-- I pretty much
add anybody.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
We'll see.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I don't listen
to my Grandmother

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
and giving funds away at the same time.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I don't know
who this Huey Freeman is,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Huh?

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
I hate to spoil such a beautiful
day with such a close friend

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
and I hurt people
and I smoke with "cigawettes."

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
That's like getting high on your own supply.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
but he doesn't stand
for what I stand for

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Hurry up. Lock it.
I'm trying.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
What we gonna do, man?
Boys.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
You smoke
with "cigawettes"?

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
I always had the drive to make money.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
and I denounce, I repudiate,
and condemn him.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
talking about the unpleasantness
of business.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Uh, you stay here
and hold the door.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Do I smoke
with "cigawettes"?

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
However, my associates
are getting nervous.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Ha-ha!
I got you, little nyukka.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Ha-ha. Man, I be smoking
with "cigawettes" all the time.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
And the plan. I knew that if I studied

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Damn! What now?

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Basically fuck him.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
enough gangster movies, I'd know everything

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
HUEY: Granddad, help.
Sorry, boys. Cheers.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
We need our money.
All of it.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I need to know to take over the streets.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Ha-ha! What up, little man?
What up?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
HUEY:
Granddad, where you going?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Jesus, boy. Look at you.
All you do

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
You bring that extra controller?
Yep.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
RILEY:
Why you punking out on us?

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
That's what's up.
Come on in, nigga.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
is lay around here
and watch TV and eat my food

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
That's not possible.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
RILEY:
Watch out, Lamilton!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
and breathe my air.
Just as lazy as you can be.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
STINKMEANER:
Bitch-ass, nyukka!

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Hey, man, apologize
to your granddad for me

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Unfortunate.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Go out and do something.
What am I supposed to do?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
about that mix-up earlier.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I ain't got no money.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I been waiting to get rid of
that piece of shit car anyway.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Now, Mr. Do, I'm sure we can
find another way

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Well, try getting up off
your ass

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You know,
'cause I called 'em, right?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
and cleaning up my living room.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
DOOMUS:
You smoke with cigarettes?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I was like: "Y'all need to get
this motherfucker out of here,

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
to work this out.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, can I have one?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
You're lucky President Obama
is not here to see this.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm listening.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
'cause I don't want this
no more."

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
No, you can't have
a cigarette, Lamilton.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
You're lazy.
You need a hobby or something.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Say, how's your gambling
addiction?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Give me an allowance
and I'll find a good hobby.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm about to cop the new shit,
nigga.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Young boys aren't supposed
to smoke with cigarettes.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
You know what I mean?
Oh, okay.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Much better.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
It can make
your lungs sick.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Allowance?
I allow you to live here.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So everything's okay?
Okay?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Now.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I don't care about my lungs.
It's fun to smoke.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I allow you to eat my food.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Everything is better
than okay, it's Thugnificent!

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm never playing
kickball again.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
I like doing
unhealthy things.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I allow you
to burn up my electricity.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I mean a money allowance.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Come on, boy,
you have to do this.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Ruckus!

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
You just wait to see
the moves your boy is making.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Ed Wuncler asked for you
by name.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Well, how about this?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Ruckus, help!

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Trash is starting to stink and
guess what?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Know what I'm saying? Federal
Reserve calling me for loans,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
It's because of him I quit
the game in the first place

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
No, no. Y'all niggas
get away from me.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
You allowed to take it out.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Obama and shit?
Know what I'm saying?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
and gave Jennifer Herman
a permanent severe limp.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Leave decent
non-nigga folks alone.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Nigga, you need some money?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Damn it, Ruckus, help me.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
RILEY: I was a loser.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Man, who the fuck is this
calling me--?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Look, nobody needs to be
reminded of that tragic day

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Help me, you fat, black,
one-eyed motherfucker.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I might as well have been dead.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
NARRATOR: I tracked down the notoriously

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
reclusive Huey Freeman here,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Ha.
Warren Motherfucking Buffett.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
when you gave that girl
a permanent severe limp.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
No, Robert, no. You brought
these niggas on yourself.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
What up, nigga?
Aw, nigga,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
It was the Junior League Championship

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
where he lives with his Grandfather and brother.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
stop beating around the bush.
How much you need?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
against Wuncler's team, and Ed had paid off the refs.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Man, what you just hit?
I don't care if I hit stuff.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Two billion?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Hi, Riley.
Yeah, whatever.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm giving you eight.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
And, oh, you guys were losing bad.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
It's fun to hit stuff.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
The first thing I notice about Huey

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
And don't pay me back,
nigga, you good.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
It was a blowout.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
There were calling him
the Tiger Woods of kickball,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
RILEY:
I-I lied, I don't really smoke

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
with "cigawettes."

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
is his incredibly large hair.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
All right, my nigga.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh. Well, hello,
little baby.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
The second thing I notice is his permanent scowl.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
before the wife-cheating thing.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Yes. Ha-ha-ha!

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Uh, let's just turn
the game on.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Now they just
call him "loser."

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Hey, Mr. Freeman.
Would you like to buy

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
I made it!
I made it! I'm free!

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
some candy to help keep kids

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
How does it feel to be labeled
a domestic terrorist?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
RILEY:
Oh, yo! It's Sergeant Gutta!

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
MAN: Huey, you suck!

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
away from gangs and guns?
Heck, no.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
WOMAN:
You suck!

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
HUEY: Granddad.
Uh?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm a fan of gangs
and guns.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Turn it up, man!
Turn it up!

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Are you having
a bad dream?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
DOOMUS:
You said that sometimes

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
you hurt people.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
GRANDDAD: The crowd started laughing,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I got some gangs
and guns inside right now,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Eh, I'm retired.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Oh, man,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
not this motherfucker again.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
and we all know you don't like to be laughed at.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Shoot, heh.
Bad for y'all.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
How do you hurt people?
Hit them.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
you want some?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I swear to God, every time
I turn the TV on,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
How?
Punch them.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Ha-ha. Mr. Freeman.
I'd love some candy.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
So then, now that it looks
like Obama is going to win,

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I see this nigga.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And you snapped.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Hit them in the face.
And in the stomach.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I'll take a whole box.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
You went crazy.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Or grab their arm and
Yank it till it breaks.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Granddad.
Shut the hell up.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
as a black
African American negro,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Mind your business.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
are you merely excited
or are you extremely excited

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
So is this it?

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
ANNOUNCER:
Freeman has hit her

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
with the pitch.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Is this what
the kids like?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Hey!

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
JAZMINE:
Thank you, Mr. Freeman.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
This what's hot
in the streets, Riley?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Oh, the horror.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Yo, it's the cops.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Okay, little baby.
Be good, now.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
that everything is going
to change forever?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, he sold over
a million records

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
And believe me, folks,
this was no accident.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Good. Now
it's a high-speed chase.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
and he do have the number one
song in the country

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
He meant to do that.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Hey, what you just sell
my granddad?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Eh.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
and he got a dance.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
If that girl is still alive,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Candy bars for the school
fundraiser, silly.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I felt my sphincter clinch

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
she will undoubtedly have
a permanent and severe limp.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
DOOMUS:
How do you feel

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
about those you hurt?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Is that what it takes
for a nigga

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Aren't you doing it?
RILEY:  The fundraiser.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
and my scrotum contract in shock

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
I don't care nothing
about those people.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
to go platinum nowadays,
a dance?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
What if you killed them?
I don't care.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I had to think back 'cause

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
ANNOUNCER:
One thing is certain:

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
at his response.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Man, anybody can make up
a dance.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I wasn't paying attention the first time.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I swear that boy
just likes to be miserable.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
She will never
play kickball again.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
That's right, kids.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
He can't enjoy nothing.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And neither
should Huey Freeman.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
It's time for
World's Ultimate Chocolates

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
All he wanna talk about
is the Bilderberg Group,

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Man, you look crazy.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
RILEY:
Let me out the car, man!

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Let me out the car!

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
You ain't gotta make up
no dance

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Well, too bad.
Ed Wuncler owns everything,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
annual candy
sale fundraiser.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
the Federal Reserve
and all that bullshit.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I don't know where
he get that from.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
just because he got one.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
including the bank
that owns this house,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I've got mine
and I can't wait

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
He didn't get it from me.
I believe in hope and change.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I ain't gonna lie though,
I kinda mess with it.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
and he just got $20 billion
in bailout money.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
to get out there
and sell, sell, sell.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
NARRATOR: Nobody knows exactly how old

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Robert Freeman is.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
And I'm trying
to be his best friend.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
OFFICER:
Hands up, now!

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I mean, but your stuff
is good too.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
If Ed Wuncler tells me to jump,
I'm gonna say how high,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
RILEY: Then I remember why I forgot.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Hey, you just wait
till my new album drops.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Please step out
of the vehicle!

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Not even Robert Freeman himself.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
and throw your ass
in the air.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
The World's Ultimate Chocolates fundraiser

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
All y'all niggas gonna see
I still got the game on smash.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm not gonna play.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
is basically like selling crack on consignment,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
But his age is estimated

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Okay, fine.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
somewhere between 80 and 120 years old.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Hey, you wanna hear
some tracks?

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
STINKMEANER: We know that niggas can create

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
conflicts based on ignorance,

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
except you don't even get no money. How they gonna

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
If you don't wanna play,
you don't wanna play.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Ed, here he is as promised.
Now get over here, boy.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
disrespect the game like that?
If you raise $500,

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
This is what me
and my generation,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm a magnificent thug

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
you can win a Hannah Montana
lenticular key ring.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
but mostly me, struggled for.
Sacrificed for, you can say,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
called "Nigga Moments."

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Good job, Robert.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
I'll remember this when I do
my Christmas yacht shopping.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
However, niggas can also create bonds with each other

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Hey! Anybody see the guy
who did all this?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
If you raise $1300
you'll receive

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
personally individually
paved the way for.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Wow. So you doing
the robot effect on your voice.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
a Jonas Brothers toothbrush,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
The dogs were after us,
so I took off my belt

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
GRANDDAD:
Yeah, boy!

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
and 5000 and you can have
this beautiful

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
WUNCLER:
Now Huey,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
also based on ignorance.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
DOOMUS:
Why did you do bad things?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
and started whipping
on the dogs.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, it's that
Auto-Tuner, son.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
the Wushung/Woodcrest
Junior/Senior

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
This bonding is called "Nigga synthesis."

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
'Cause it's fun.
It's fun to do bad things.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Chronicles of Narnia
iPod case.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Then I started running.
Then I looked behind me.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
It lets you sing,
even if you can't sing.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Harmonious Kickball Tournament
is the greatest

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Jesse Jackson was supposed
to be there,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
kickball competition
in the history of the sport.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
but he had jumped
into a Dumpster. Hiding.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
It's terrible

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Unlike the bonds of friends and family,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
All right,
who's ready to sell some candy?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
That punk-ass.
NARRATOR:  I find it difficult

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
One hundred and twenty-nine years ago,

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
which are mutually beneficial, nigga synthesis is based

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
to determine whether Robert is a pathological liar

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Wow. So you used it
on this one too.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
my great-great Grandpa Prescott Rothschild Wuncler

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Aw, man,
you doing that?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
You don't even get
to keep none of the money.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
on a mutual appreciation for ignorant or trivial things.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
or suffering the early stages of dementia.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, but I've sold $4000
of candy so far,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Yep. Every song
on the whole CD.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
sailed to Wushung, China.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Hot, right?

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
The local monks had invented a game similar to baseball,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
which means I'm only $1000
away from that iPod case.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
So if the election is fake,
then what's really going on?

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Heh, yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Now, when a nigga moment collides with nigga synthesis,

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Damn.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
except it involved a red rubber ball and a lot of kicking.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
RILEY: Ow! Ow!

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
you get a complete motherfucking disaster.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
GRANDDAD:
You got a lot of nerve,

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
RILEY: And that's when it hit me.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
The end of America.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
RILEY:
I thought Flonominal was

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
supposed to be back this week.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
riding around in a stolen car
with some hooligan!

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
The best idea I ever had in my entire life.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Remember this equation.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I felt despair so terrible

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Man, that nigga, man.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
He originally called it "Jap baseball"

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Like I wasn't gonna whoop
your narrow behind!

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
You will need it later, nigga.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
That's the worst idea

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I briefly consider slitting my own wrists,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
You know he
went and got a job?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
because he didn't know what country he was in

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
A what?
I know, nigga.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
RILEY:
Granddad, please stop!

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Stop, Granddad!

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
you ever had
in your entire life.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
or bludgeoning myself about the head

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
and didn't care.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
You just mad
you didn't think of it.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
That's what I said. A job?
Can you believe this?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
He brought the sport back to America,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
with a steel pipe or baseball bat.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
You want to start
a fundraiser with no cause?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Talking about he need
health insurance and shit.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
where the liberal PC bitch-asses

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
I sw-- I swear to God,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Granddad, please,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Cause, nigga?
I'm the cause.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
But I brought no blade, no pipe, no bat.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm like, "damn, nigga,
pull down your skirt."

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
renamed it "kickball."

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
you killing me, stop!

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
'Cause I wanna a house.
'Cause I wanna a yacht.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Know what I'm saying?
Take the dick out your ass.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Today, in the spirit of harmony between our two cities,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
GRANDDAD:
What the hell

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
you doing smoking?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Describe Riley Freeman
in one word.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Acting like
little bitches, man.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
'Cause I wanna get
this guap, nigga.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And this nigga Macktastic,
went back to pimping and shit.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
we alternate hosting a kickball tournament

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Mm, I'd say real nigga.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
RILEY:
Oh, God, please...

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
That's the cause.
You watch a lot

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
known as the Wushung/Woodcrest Junior/Senior

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Jesus, please help me...

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
of gangster movies, right?
I seen all of them.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
It's funny how niggas
change on you, man,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
"Real nigga"
is two words.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
That's how I know
what to do.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
know what I'm saying?
So you here all by yourself?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Harmonious Kickball Tournament.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Help me, Jesus.
GRANDDAD: Shut up!

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Okay, how many of them
have a happy ending?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I know it's two words, nigga.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
From now on you don't talk
to Lamilton Taeshawn,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Real niggas
don't follow instructions.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, just me.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
HUEY:
There's no way I'm playing.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
you don't see
Lamilton Taeshawn,

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, but see,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
NARRATOR: This is Robert Freeman's

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
other grandson, Riley.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Hey, what's up, y'all?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Because of you, I gave a girl
a permanent limp.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Just got back from work.
Hey, y'all hungry?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
you don't even think
about Lamilton Taeshawn.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
that's how I know
it's gonna work, right?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh, really?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
'Cause I seen
all the mistakes they made,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
He's empowered by the prospect of a black president,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
This little girl?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Do you understand me?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Oh, and Leonard.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
RILEY:
I-I understand!

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
I understand! I promise!

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
and I'm not gonna make
them same mistakes.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh, hell no.
What y'all want, niggas?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
but not in the way society would hope or expect.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Oh, man!

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
See, I'm gonna do everything
the smart way.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
That's right, Huey.
Jennifer can walk just fine.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Hurry up.
I ain't got all day.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
My Frosty is melted!
Damn it, Leonard!

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Good! Now, I want you
to sit there

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Riley, I'm gonna to tell you
everything

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Oh, if my nigga Obama
gets up in there,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
We're looking for a place
called Woodcrest. Is this it?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
What the fuck, nigga, did you
take the long way home again?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
and think about
how stupid you are.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
that's about to happen
if you do this,

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Hit it, Jenny.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I'm gonna act a fool!

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
You were dominating the entire
Woodcrest Junior League,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Maybe.
Look, you want gas or not?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I'm going to sleep.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
and how bad
this is gonna end.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
My bad, it took longer
'cause I had to ride my bike

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
First of all--
Aw, stop right there.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
I ain't doing
no more homework, nothing.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
We're looking for a man.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
We taking over.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
since the car had got--
Uh, never mind, man, fuck it.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
and I couldn't have that.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Oh, yeah,
I bet you are.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
I made up the story about
Jennifer's permanent limp,

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Every time
I wanna do something,

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Come on, what's a cop
gonna do to me?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
You're looking
for the number man.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
you tell me
what's gonna happen first,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm gonna be like, "Don't make
me call the president, bitch."

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
LEONARD:
Should I tell you

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
what happened to the car?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Or the weed man.
Or the welfare man.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
That ain't hurt.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
correctly assuming the emotional
trauma of the event

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
and then that's what happen.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
THUGNIFICENT:
I said never mind!

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
And you always ruin
the endings of stuff, man.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And the cops, he gonna be like,
"Oh, snap, Riley a real nigga,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
No, the man I'm looking for
is named Freeman.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Lamilton Taeshawn is not a typical 8-year-old.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
MAN:
Okay, we're back.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
would make you
quit the game.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Robert Freeman.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I'm sick of it. I wanna be
surprised this time.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
This is DJ Vlad
and I told you we have a very,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
But now I need to win this game
against the Chinese.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
While most kids in his neighborhood

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
the president's a real nigga,
we can't do nothing."

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh, hell, no. I knew it.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
So no matter how bad it is,
you don't wanna hear it?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
You related
to Robert Freeman?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
were at home playing video games,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
very special guest
in the studio this morning.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
You were willing to scar me
for life over a kickball game?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
he was leaving a path of destruction

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Nope.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
'Cause it's really bad.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I can't wait.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
This man right here
is a legend in the game.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
So you know him?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
behind the wheel of an SUV he stole from his grandmother.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
But that's how good
of an opponent you were.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah, I know him.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Hey. Spoiler alert, nigga.
Didn't you hear me?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
In my driveway

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
A pioneer, if you will.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
But Woodcrest don't need
no more coloreds.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Give him respect,
Thugnificent!

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
But this game is bigger
than you and me, Huey.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
And I came into the kitchen and I saw my keys were gone,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Keep it to yourself.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I got planes

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
We got our colored quota
filled.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
NARRATOR: This is Otis Jenkins.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
What up everybody.
Man, what an honor.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I present the Woodcrest
Harmonious kickball team.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
So y'all can just
get to stepping

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
But in the United States, he's better known

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
and get in
that piece of shit car,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
."

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
How are you, man?
Who, me?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
First, courtesy of Blackwater
USA, the senior squad--

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
turn it around
and head it back up the road,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Here. Good luck.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
by his rap moniker Thugnificent.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Heh, oh, you know,
I'm Thugnificent!

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Krusty the Coon.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
I can't believe Granddad

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
wouldn't let me do
no interviews.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Thanks.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
A combination of the words "thug" and "magnificent."

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
HUEY:
Mercenaries?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Why don't you just
tell me where Robert is,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
What's it like for you older
cats now in the game

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Lamilton blowing up
over this.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
They prefer the term
"private kickball contractors."

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
before I put five across
your lip, you big black dummy.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
That still kind
of spoiled it, though.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
in terms of, you know,
where you fit in musically?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I bet he get his own
TV show.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Otis has found success

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
like many Negro-American entertainers today

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I mean, what was it like,
you know,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
And this
is the junior squad?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Ooh, I bet he do.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
RILEY: The second rule

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
of fundraising is that

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
when you were at your peak,
so to speak?

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Yeah, start talking,
you one-eyed, fish-eyed fool.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
REPORTER: Lamilton, where were you going?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
WUNCLER:
The best the Dominican Republic

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
has to offer.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
fundraising is not illegal.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
by being a professional buffoon.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Which was so long ago.
I'm saying, I mean,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I went and drove and pick up my friend

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
As you can see, I've spared
no expense for victory.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
and he smokes with "cigawettes."

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
See, that's 'cause you not technically

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Are you supporting
Barack Obama?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
my first joint came out, like,
four years ago. You know that?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Hey. We ain't got all night,
buffalo butt.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
stealing from people. They give you the money.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
REPORTER: Once he picked up his friend,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
another unidentified

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
So maybe you lie about what you gonna do with it.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
For what?
For president.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I know, seems like 40,
doesn't it?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I ain't scared of y'all
decrepit Negroes. Come on.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
8-year-old, the two went on a nearly fatal rampage

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
President of what?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Now, the new CD drops
next week, right?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
But you never actually take they money from 'em.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
You don't know
there's a black man

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
through the Woodcrest area.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
running for president
named Barack Obama?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
No doubt, no doubt.
The CD is crazy.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
And that's why it's legal.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Lamilton, what about the people you could have hurt?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
RILEY: Jazmine and Phil

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
His name is Barack?
For real?

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
It's on fire. It's got
something for everybody.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
It's the greatest junior/senior
kickball team ever assembled.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Yo. Turn on the news.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I don't care nothing about those people.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
were the top candy sellers in the class.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Barack Obama, yes.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
If I was gonna take over the candy game,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Get the fuck out of here.
Barack?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
It's got joints for the streets,
it's got joints for the ladies,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Tell me you don't want
to be part of kickball history.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I wanted to do hoodrat stuff with my friends.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
The attack happened yesterday
at this gas station

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I'd need they help.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Yes, Barack.
Where's he from, Africa?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
See, you have to understand.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
it's got joints for the ladies
in the streets.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I don't want to be a part
of kickball history.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
just outside
of Woodcrest.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Who are we raising
the money for?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
His dad was African,
yes.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
The victim, a Mr. Uncle Ruckus--
No relation. --had this to say:

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
All children his age love stealing cars

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
A good cause.
What cause?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
You can't be serious, man.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
The CD is called, Mo' Bitches, Mo' Problems,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm not making a request.
I'm prepared to blackmail you

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
and going on high-speed chases.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Uh, a bunch of causes.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
There ain't no nigga running for
president named Barack Obama!

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
you know what I'm saying,
so go cop that.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
with a picture of you wearing
Kanye West Venetian sunglasses,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Lord,
there was three of them.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
REPORTER: Lamilton, why exactly

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
All of them.
Gangs, guns...

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Shout out to B.I.G.
Real hip-hop, you feel me.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Uh, all that good stuff.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
nut-hugger jeans
and Louis Vuitton driving shoes.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Two black nigga men
and one black nigga woman.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
did you steal your grandmother's car?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
No fucking way, man.
No fucking way.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
B.I.G.? Whoo,
talk about old school.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Something that helps animals?
Yeah, sure.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I don't believe you.
Stop fucking with me.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
'Cause it's fun. It's fun to do bad things.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Oh, they each had big black
lips, big black nostrils,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Whatever. We'll keep gangs
and guns away from animals.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
If he wins, I think
it will literally be

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
All right, so,
Thugnificent,

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
That's Photoshopped.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Riley, don't you think
that kid seems a little...

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Explain that to media takeout.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I-I don't know.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
who you feeling
in the game right now?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
and a big black
attitude problem.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
the best day
of my life.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
What are you banging
in your trunk right now?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I'll risk it.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
off?
Off, like how?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I still think the school
would be really mad.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
WUNCLER:
All right, Huey.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Police have released
this composite sketch

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Okay, I didn't
wanna tell you this,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Okay, okay. You know,
I'm definitely feeling

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I'm not a fan of the truth,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Off like not quite normal.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
of the attackers based
on the victim's description.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
NARRATOR: Tom and Sarah Dubois

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
a lot of cats right now.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
but here it is:

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
See, that's your problem.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
are also neighbors of the Freemans.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm feeling my main man,
uh, Young Cow Tipper,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
the Chinese are calling in
some debts

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
You wanna be normal
like everybody else.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
World's Ultimate Chocolates

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Yo. Ha-ha!

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
They both work on the Obama campaign.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Joc Daddy Pimp,
Lil' Hob Nobba,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
and I had to bet everything
on this game.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
they secretly funded
by the Ku Klux Klan.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Goo Goo da Bone Mouf.
Little Rich.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
How he get beat up
by a gang of old people?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
But see, me and Lamilton,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Barack has already changed
our lives in so many ways.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
My banks, your home,
everything.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
we wanna be different
from normal.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Ezbot and Rose, I'm feeling
Willie Whistle Work C, uh,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
That's odd.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
We wanna be abnormal.
We just do whatever.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
And al Qaeda.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
NARRATOR:
How?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
my main man,
Trick Money Smitty.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
You think I'm bad,
just wait until the Chinese

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I ain't seen nothing
that bad

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
since Granddad got beat up
by Stinkmeaner.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, I mean,
it's no secret

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Lil Phanta,
putting in his work.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
take away all the freedoms
you enjoy.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
No matter what nobody say.
I'm gonna do

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
that me and Tom have had
some problems in the past

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Hey.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Look out for his
mix tape.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Freedom to complain.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
what I wanna do
whenever, whatever. What?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
What do you think?
"Young Reezy's Fun-Raiser."

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
with our relationship.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Pew Boi Pimp,
Nasty Murda Trae, Epis Green,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
It's all right, Granddad.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Well, it's not like
the whole world knew.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Freedom to have as many
offspring and assault rifles

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I probably kill a nigga too
if they embarrass me like that.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Lil' Big Dolla,
Snowbunny Sampson.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
GRANDDAD:
Shut the hell up

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
before I come down there

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I like it. Sounds like,
you know,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Um, I'm feeling
a lot of cats right now.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
But I think ever since

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
as you like.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I killed a man
in self-defense.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
and beat you till
you pee on yourself again.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
some of that positive
bullshit that people eat up.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
we started working
together for Barack...

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Lot of people doing
they thing.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
The freedom
to surf the Internet

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
In defense of your ego,
maybe.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Ha-ha. Now what about
Sergeant Gutta?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Well, tough titty for him.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I do what I wanna do.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
RILEY: Since I came up

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
with the idea,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Things are
totally different now.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
for pornography
of your choice.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Jazmine and Phil had to provide

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Much better. And it's all thanks
to Barack.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Man...

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Not the porn.
I'll risk it.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
He's dead
and I'm going fishing.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Coming.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
the startup money for the business.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Fuck Sergeant Gutta!

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
This is our candy money,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
He is such a wonderful,
wonderful man.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
we need to get this back,
Riley.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
That nigga can
eat a dick!

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
No yacht for you.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Why you guys so worried?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I just think it's about time
we had a president

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Damn it.
Who is it?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
You're wearing
a bulletproof vest.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
who was smart and tall and
charming and strong and fit.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
It's that damn crazy kid
with some old woman.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Hold on, hold on, everyone
quiet down, quiet down!

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
What do I do?
I don't want

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Just like your hubby?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Wow. I just want to make sure
I heard you correctly.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
that crazy little nigga
in my house.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
RILEY: Cindy MacPhearson,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
a.k.a. C-Murder.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
I said fuck that nigga!

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
This isn't about you,
sweetie.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I ain't-- I ain't really
the type of nigga to be,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Excusez-moi.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Okay, think.
Gotta stall for a plan.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
She had the whole Girl Scout cookie game on lock.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
NARRATOR: It is always obvious

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
when a couple hasn't engaged

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
you know, all on the radio,
running his mouth,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
We here for Huey
and Riley Freeman.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Uh, who is it?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
starting beef and all that,
you know what I'm saying.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
It's Lamilton and his
grandmother, Mr. Freeman.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
What up, Cindy? I just seen
this kid over there,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
in normal marital relations for some time.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
: Huey Freeman, please report

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
to the front office.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
But I'm just saying, that shit
sound like some bullshit!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Shit, that didn't
buy me no time.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
right over there
around the corner over there,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
You are the one
who quit the game.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Obama, of course, is as polarizing

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And that retarded dance, man.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
and I know she ain't down
with your team.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Just see what they want.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Who?
I don't know.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
as he is transformative.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
See, that's what you get
when you let 13-year-olds rap.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
You must have me mistaken
for somebody else.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I don't care what they want.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Some skinny
big-headed bitch.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I don't want these
crazy people in my life.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Word? Come on.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Some have accused Obama of being a socialist.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
You know what's going on?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
How-- How old--
How old is that nigga?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
You were a great player.
Why did you quit?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Oh, this is so unfair. Why me?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
RILEY: She wasn't like Jazmine

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
and Phil. Cindy was a G.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
They said our aunt and uncle
came to pick us up.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
All right. One second.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Others believe that he's a Muslim.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
That nigga 15 years old,
dawg.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Why will you not play in the
Harmonious Kickball Tournament?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Yo, well, he sound like
he 15 months old.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Aunt and uncle?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
What you think
you're doing here?

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Some have gone as far as to label him the Antichrist.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Man, something's not right.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
That nigga sound like he
got a nipple in his mouth.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
What's it matter to you?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
You talking to me?
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
My name is Ming.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Come on, let's go.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Hey, Sergeant Gutta,
I got an idea.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr. Freeman.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Open your bag.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
He is the socialist Muslim
Antichrist.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I am captain of the Wushung
Harmonious Junior/Senior

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
What's in your bag?
Ow.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Why don't you take
your momma's motherfucking titty

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
But I know it was
your grandson

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
I'll kill you, bitch.
Get her, Cindy.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
This is Uncle Ruckus.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
out your mouth
so you can rap, nigga.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
kickball team.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Just how far away
is their classroom? The moon?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
smoking with cigarettes
in the car with Lamilton

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
He's an Uncle Tom.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Even before I was born,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Come here. Come here.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Perhaps the biggest Uncle Tom to have ever lived.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
it was decided I would be a champion kickball player.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
They should've been here
by now.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
and I just thought
he should come over here

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
RILEY: But what I really liked

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
about her

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
and apologize for putting
Riley in danger like that.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
If this nigga gets elected,
America is over. Over.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
You know kids,
always lollygagging.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
was that she had less compassion

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
RILEY: Thugnificent's CD dropped

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
the next week.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
At 3 years old I was taken to the National Kickball

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
than the average girl.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
It'll just be a second.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Oh, that's not really necessary.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Can I offer you
some water or--

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
GIRL 1: Take off, bitch.
GIRL 2: Yeah, take off.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
You want this nigga to shit

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
SoundScan say he ain't sold shit.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Training Center outside of Beijing.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Can we leave now?
Yes.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
in the same place
William Taft shat?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
No. Now get in
that house right now

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
GIRL 3:
Run away, baby.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
RILEY:
Yo, where we going?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
And his big wife, she don't need
to be in the White House.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Thugnificent was all fucked up.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
and get ready
to start apologizing.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
I trained every day and every night to be the best.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I don't know,
but we getting out of here.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Really, that's not-- I don't
want that to happen.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Hey, how's
the cookie hustle?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
She should be in the WNBA
shooting foul shots.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Lamilton, I said
get in that house!

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
It's cool.
You want a box?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
My grandfather says to control the ball,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Nah, I don't give.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
You get to keep
any of that cookie money?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I must control myself.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I wish. I'll move up
in the Girl Scout ranks,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Ah. You want my brick,
you gonna have to pry it

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
But just me and the ball alone
is no kickball.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Well, well, well.
We came a long way

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
And I wanna apologize
to all of you

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Yo, it's Thugnificent. You know what, matter of fact,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
get awards and whatnot.
But no cash.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
from my cold dead hands,
Mr. Obama Hussein.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Without a worthy opponent,
I nothing.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
to kill y'all
little niglets.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
for what I did.
It was very wrong,

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I got a business proposal
for you.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
it ain't Thugnificent. You know why?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
We must have
the ultimate contest

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Now it's time
for the big bonanza.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
and I am very sorry.
I just would like to move on

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
There's a lot of bars
I need to move.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Because I ain't feeling too Thugnificent right now.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
You're not talking
about that stupid

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
to settle once and for all
who is the best.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
and lead a normal life.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
This Otis. That's right,
you all niggas getting

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
school candy fundraiser.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Nigga down!

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
You know, get a job
and a wife, and change my ways.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
You know that's for suckers,
right?

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
NARRATOR:
What is wrong with letting

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
people be happy?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
the government name.
It's Otis Jenkins.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Like I said, you have me
mistaken for somebody else.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You know what this is,
suckers.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
And I hope this apology
impresses you

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Do I looks like a sucker?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And I gotta holler
at y'all real quick

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Can too much hope
possibly be a bad thing?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
When you ready to make
some real dough,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
about why y'all ain't coming out
to support your boy.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
even though my grandmother
made me do it

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
holler at me.
Get it? Dough, cookies?

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Hope is irrational.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Y'all ain't supporting
Thugnificent

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Yo, you see these
two old-ass niggas?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
and I don't really mean it.
You mean you do mean it.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
and I think
that's real fucked up.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I mean I do mean it.
I don't think he means it.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
All y'all niggas
can eat a dick.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
In Bavaria, we have a saying:

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Come on.
Yo.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Look, Mr. Freeman,
I just would hate for you

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
All y'all motherfuckers
on my friends list.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Why we running?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm talking about Facebook
niggas as well as MySpace.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
to feel like you had
to stop Riley and Lamilton

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
If y'all ain't buying the CD,
don't holler at me online,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
RILEY: We had everything we needed

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
It means, "This is the most depressing fucking kid

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Damn, them old niggas
can jump.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
from being friends
because of this. Please.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
to look like a legit company.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
no friend requests, nothing.
Y'all send me stupid

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Riley is the nicest boy

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Website, labels, and lots and lots of candy.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
fucking messages all day,

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Lamilton's ever
been friends with.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I've ever met in my life."

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
but won't pay
for my damn song?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
That kid's in more trouble
than I thought.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I hate y'all niggas, man.
"Hey, hey, Thugnificent,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I sit down once again with Thugnificent,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Well, I appreciate
the apology, but--

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
"Is it 'booty butt cheeks'

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Please, Mr. Freeman.
Lamilton is not a bad child.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
who appears to have undergone a political awakening

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
or is it
'move them butt cheeks'?"

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
I'll play.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Nigga, who gives a fuck?
It's a song about butt cheeks!

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
But I'm not interested
in your ultimate contest.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I swear. He's an A-B student,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
since our last conversation.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Well, why ain't I getting

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
no spins?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
It's just a simple game
of kickball.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
he helps me around the house,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
So you know
who Obama is now?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
most of the time
he's no problem.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Sorry kids, tapped out.
Someone just came through

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
No, no, no, it's your job
to make sure it gets played

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Oh, no, I knew
who the nigga was.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Motherfucking ass
like you stole something.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Mm-hm.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
selling chocolate.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I was just joking.
You were not joking.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
So you decided to come fight
for freedom?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
He just has some anger
management issues, you know?

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
on the radio, not--
Say what? You wanna drop me?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Who you think
you fucking with, huh?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
You jumped on the Obama
celebrity bandwagon

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Well, you made
the right choice.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Mm-hm.
And when he was little,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I just bought some
from little Timothy.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
You wanna drop Thugnifi--
Hello?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
all he ever saw
was domestic abuse between

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
because it will give you
much needed exposure.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
All right, bring it in.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
MAN:
Ugh, if I see another bar

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
of chocolate

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
A few minutes ago,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
his mother and his father...
Mm-hm.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
No, see. It ain't even got
nothing to do with that.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
in a gross violation
of my civil liberties,

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Damn, damn, damn!

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I'm gonna be sick.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
You know what I'm saying?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
...his uncles,
his aunties, his cousins.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Hey, boy.
How's the candy business?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I started looking into his
political positions and his--

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
the INS repossessed
the five Dominican players

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Mm-hm.
And I just been trying

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
to get him some help.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Terrible.
We couldn't move nothing.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
And his policies
and views and whatnot.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Everything okay?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
from the junior squad
of the Woodcrest Harmonious

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And then when he was 5,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
What policies?
I heard the nigga speak,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Huh? Oh, oh, yeah, yeah,
little man.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
The streets are flooded
with chocolate

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
kickball team.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I remember his mother
was drinking heavily

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
and he was talking
about changing some shit

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Everything's cool. Um, just time
to make some bigger moves.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
from the school fundraiser.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
We must immediately find a
replacement for these players.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
at the time, and his father

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
or hoping for some shit,
and I thought: "Yeah."

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
GRANDDAD:

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
had just been laid off
from his job at Popeyes,

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Well, I just wanted to say
I'm proud of you.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
You know what I'm saying?
That's all.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I'm baiting this hook

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Thanks, Granddad.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I mean, all the nigga's
asking for is hope.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
I'm now exploring the
possibility of child soldiers

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
and there was a lot
of tension in the house...

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Some fish today

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
You wanna buy some candy?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
You can sit on your ass
all day and hope.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
And he just wanted
to have a little fun,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Hell, no. You must be out of
your damn mind.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
If you too lazy to hope
you a lazy motherfucker,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Hey, what's up, y'all?

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
from Sierra Leone,
but they may not get here in--

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Good morning.
Crabbing, huh?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I mean, he's a little boy,
and sometimes

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Now, get that out of here.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
See, we need to make it

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
that's all I know.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Hey, man.
I got a surprise for you.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Huh?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Heh-heh.
How's it going?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
they're going
to get in trouble.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
I'm voting for Obama

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I've seen that video
you put on your MySpace.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Oh, I think I might catch me
a few more today.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
where they ain't
no competition.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
because he's gonna
lower my taxes.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Say again? Affirmative,
we're on our way.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Okay, okay, fine, fine.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
We need to move on them.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
You know, how they don't be
buying your CD and stuff, right?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
The boys can still be friends.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Push them out street
by street, block by block.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
NARRATOR:
Actually, he has promised

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Come on, guys, that's us.
Moving out! Moving out!

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Fascinating creature,
the crab.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
But now, if you'll excuse me,
we have some very important

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
to raise taxes
at your income level.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, here.
I got 'em today after work.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Got that hard exterior,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
That's what
Beanie Sigel would do.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Huh?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
but he ain't
really dangerous,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
TiVo to watch,
don't wanna miss it.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
And he's just
really, really fit...

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I spent my whole check,
but I want you to know

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Why don't we just get
the kids at school

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
What's going on?
Sorry, Mr. Wuncler.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
except to another crab.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Thank you, and please, no need
to ever come back again.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
to work for us
instead of the school?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I support you, man.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
POW rescue in Afghanistan.
Wait! Wait!

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Dumb as all hell,
can't even walk straight.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Ever. Cheers.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
How?
We'll walk up to them

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
to lead.
And also body fit too.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
See, that-- Look at 'em!
What the fuck do I need

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
and say, "Hey,"
and they say, "What?"

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
So me and Lamilton
can still be friends?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Well, I also support Obama

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
several copies
of my own CD for, Leonard!

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Goddamn it! Fuck the POW.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And then we say,
"This is our block.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Matter of fact, the only thing
a crab is good for

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Hell, no. I ever catch you
around that fat fucker again

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
because he's against
corporate bailouts.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
You are staying here
and playing kickball.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Now, you gonna get down,
or you gonna lay down?"

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Come on, man,
we can't afford for you

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
That is also not true.
Huh?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
is holding back
other crabs.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
I'm gonna chain you
to the bedpost.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
And if they be like,

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
I'm supporting Obama
because he black.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
just to be throwing
money away!

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And I ain't playing
with you.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
I didn't throw it away.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
A crab don't wanna see
another crab make it.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
"Uh-- Uh, I don't know,
let me think about it,"

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I-I bought the--
You didn't--

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Lamilton Taeshawn is back in the news.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Well, team captain,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah...

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
we pull out the roscoe
and we be like:

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And that reminds me, man.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
you've got two days
to assemble a new team.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
And he's gonna get the troops
out of Afghanistan, right?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Uh, I guess.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Two weeks ago, he achieved nationwide fame

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I don't know
what we gonna do,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
And they be like,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
but I don't think
I can keep supporting us

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Team captain?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
MAN:
Crab is like, "If I'm

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
gonna die, we all gonna die."

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
for stealing a car at the tender age of 8.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Also wrong.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
off my Wendy's checks.
Oh, here we go.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
"Ugh, you shot me,"
and we be like,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Then what the fuck
that nigga gonna do?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
GRANDDAD:
Yep, new team, no problem,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Mr. Wuncler.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
"Take that, faggots."

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
We're on it.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Now he's assaulted his grandmother

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
We all need to, you know,
do some shit sometimes.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
What you trying to say,
Leonard? Huh?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I admire that.
Mm-hm.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
at a local Walli-Mart.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
How long did I carry you, nigga?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
According to witnesses,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
We could offer them
a better deal,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
You know what I'm saying?
Some shit needs to get done.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
like better prizes
or something.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
How long did I pay the bills
in this motherfucker

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
We all gotta die sometimes,

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Lamilton asked his grandmother

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And until we do that shit,
shit ain't gonna change.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
might as well
help each other get there.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
to buy him some fried chicken.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
That's not what Beans would do.
Beans would go to war.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
that you living in?
See how niggas forget?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
When she refused, he got angry.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Cindy's right.
Beans would go to war.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
So I thought to myself,
"Let's do this shit."

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
You see? You see
how niggas forget?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Who the fuck are you?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I mean, that's what you did
to Stinkmeaner.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
No, no, Thugnificent,
it's that I only make, like,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I am Jigme.
I come from Tibet.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Here he is assaulting his grandmother.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
And that's when will.i.am
called me

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I want to defeat the Chinese
oppressors in kickball.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Again, and again, and yet again.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
But war is bad for business.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
about doing this damn song.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
7.50 a hour and the mortgage
on this place is, like,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Isn't that right,
Robert Freeman?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
We'll do better
than stupid prizes.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
NARRATOR: Thugnificent joins

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
12,000 a month.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Why?
I hate fucking Chinese.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Then he stops, walks to the counter

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
will.i.am's all-star celebrity tribute to Barack Obama.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Put the word out. You sell
for us, we'll pay you. Cash.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
So I did the math
and that means I'd have to work,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
No, no, no, no!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
to order the chicken, then goes back

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
like, 82 hours a day.
So I went in,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'd like a word with you
in private.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
to beat on his grandmother some more.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Things weren't working right

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
You don't know--
What's happening?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
RILEY: That brings us to the third

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
rule of fundraising.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
asked the manager
for some overtime and he said:

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
This team is pathetic.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Just wait a minute now.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Lamilton, did you hit your grandmother?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
You gotta pay the cost of doing business.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
I said, I wanna fight

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
"He couldn't do it 'cause it's

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
against company policy.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
It's your ass now.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah. I beat her ass. But why?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
They don't stand a chance
against the Chinese.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
'Cause I asked for some fried chicken and she said no.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
"You just started here.
Who you think you are?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Not one single
goddamn shot in hell.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Put that away.
Put it away.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Hey, Riley.
Yeah?

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
And said, yes, we can

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
What she expect?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I heard that
you're selling candy

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
"Be lucky with the hours
that you get.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
for a different
fundraising company.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Cindy's pregnant
and she has to work."

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
It'll be an embarrassment
they'll never, ever live down

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
REPORTER: Lamilton's grandmother

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
wants the public

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
One that pays kids cash.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I want to ride your nuts

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I was like, "but Cindy--"

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I figure maybe I could work

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
to give Lamilton another chance.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Maybe.
Why should I tell you?

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
for the rest of their miserable
lives until they die.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
You're the man

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
You have to understand,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Aw, come on, man.
I've been busting my ass

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
two jobs at the same time.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
he really likes that fried chicken.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Maybe I could be on the phone
doing some telemarketing,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
selling candy for months
and all I've gotten

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
You know what one of these balls
can do to a human body?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I'll whoop your ass.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
is this stupid key ring.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Hear me what I'm saying,
nigga?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
It's called
Young Reezy's Fun-Raisers,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
and work on, like,
some art and sell art

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
They'll get torn to pieces.
Ripped to shreds.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Punk-ass motherfuckers.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Hey, did you see me on TV?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
but I don't think
it's for you, Jeff.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
out of the back of Wendy's.
Oh, man! Why me?

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Some may even lose control
of their bowels.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Hell, yeah.
Man, I really liked

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
They only want hustlers.
People who'll do anything

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
WILL.I.AM:

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
how you handled yourself
on the news.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
to gets that sale
and make that money.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
THUGNIFICENT:

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I used that stupid
fucking Auto-Tuner on my voice,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
By the third inning
they'll be pissing and shitting

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
You wasn't apologetic
or nothing.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
A lot of people can't handle
that fast lifestyle.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
Riding, riding

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
I instigated a rap beef.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I'm gonna be
a famous superstar.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And I even tried
to make a dance, nigga.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
on themselves right in front
of their friends and loved ones.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
I swear I can handle it.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I wanna be famous
for doing bad things.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Nothing seems to work.
Um...

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It's gonna be flat-out
fucking terrible.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah, my Granddad
tried to tell me

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Thugnificent?
This might be a bad time,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
We must find
some better athletes.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I couldn't hang out
with you no more,

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
RILEY: When they called me

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
to the office

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
but Sergeant Gutta just posted
a response to you on YouTube.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
but I was like,
"Man, we do

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
This is what you got.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
BOY:
You can't catch me.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
I already knew what it was for.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Dick-riding for the gay

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
what we wanna do."
We gots the juice.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
By now they had figured out we had knocked off

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
WOMAN:
Damn bell done rang.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Come on, let's go.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Hey, dawg. First off I wanna say

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I don't ever listen
to nobody.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
over half the students in the school.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Dick-riding for Iraq

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
that I'm a huge fan of Thugnificent.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
If somebody gives me
good advice

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
He's waiting for you.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I grew up listening to Thugnificent.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I do the opposite thing.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
To ride that dick

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Matter of fact, I'd even go ahead,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
I want to say a few words
to everybody here

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
So, what do you wanna do now?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
As it's Barack's

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
as far to say that I love this nigga, no homo.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Let's have some more fun.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Nobody say nothing.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Okay.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Dick-riding

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
He is one of the real niggas

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
about victory.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Is it true that you're
soliciting students

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
that made me wanna do this shit.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Unfortunately there's absolutely
no time to train you people.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
to work for a different,
competing fundraiser?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
NARRATOR: It is finally election night.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
But fuck this old-ass nigga, man!

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
This, uh, Young Reezy's
Fun-Raiser company?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Robert Freeman is throwing a party.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
But I have bought each of you
a brand-new pair of sneakers.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, it's been
a long, black struggle.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
This old nigga is old enough to be my dad

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
They put the fun in fundraising.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
and he telling me to eat a dick?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
That is completely
unacceptable.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And I felt me and Barack
deserved a party.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Nigga, what's wrong with you?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
These shoes were handmade

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
You will stop at once.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
NARRATOR: All around I see black faces

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
beaming with elation.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
You a grown-ass man and you telling a 15-year-old

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
with the youngest Chinese
sweatshop labor we could find.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
You done it now.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
I don't think so.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Okay.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
We already have
permission slips

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Yeah, man, I'm gonna be
the next black president.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
to eat a dick? I know your mother

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
raised you better than that, dawg. Matter of fact...

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Wear them with pride.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
from half
the school's parents,

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
NARRATOR: It is as though each of them

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
has been elected president.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
I'm gonna be like, "Take this,
you yellow rat bastard."

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
saying that they'll sell candy
for us exclusively.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh, God! It's urine
and hot sauce!

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I can't believe this.
Shame on you.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Excuse me, is this Miss Jenkins?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Motherfucker!

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
WOMAN:  Yes, it is.  My name is Sergeant Gutta.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Shame on me?
What, you better than me?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Almost each of them.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Greetings, friends.
Forgive our intrusion.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
The state puts you in charge
of these kids,

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
And I don't know if you aware,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
but your son said some very rude things

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and you turn around
and pimp them out

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
What's wrong with you?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
We came to wish you luck
in tomorrow's game.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I thought you'd be
dancing on your tail

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
about me on the radio. Yes, I know.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
to some second-rate
candy racket?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
You disgust me.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
with the rest of the circus
chimps. Look at them.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
He said some very rude things. He's too old

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
I look forward
to an unforgettable contest.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I'm curious,
what's your cut?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Just as happy
as a pig in shit.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
to be acting like that, and I know I don't like him

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
How much does the school get?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Can't they see?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
using that language either.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Can't they see
what this nigga's gonna do

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Aah! Crabs on my face. Aah!

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
How much is your soul worth?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
You know, I one time--  That was your momma, nigga.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Give them
their ball back.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Five percent.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
to our great country?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Your momma.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Five percent?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Looks like we the only
two people with sense

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Pfft. All right, fine.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Grow your old ass up, nigga.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
in this whole room.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I hope you go broke, you feel me?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Help! Help!

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I'll match that.
Can we go now?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Just you and me.
Just you and me.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
GRANDDAD:
Damn.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I hope that the IRS is on they way over

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Uh, fair enough.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
GRANDDAD:
Ruckus, shut up

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and get back to work.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
right now to take your shit, nigga.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
J. Edgar Hoover Elementary

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
And grab some more champagne.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
GRANDDAD:
Why, Lord, why?

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
likes to see its students
giving back to the community.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
See? Niggas already
getting uppity.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I can't believe
it's happening again.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So I'm thinking
that this gonna be my new look.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Who are these people?
And where did they come from?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I don't give to nobody.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
HUEY: Desperate for answers,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Hey, it's getting late,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I just pay the cost
to do business.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh. That's a way to go.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
I believe, this is the gentleman
you're looking for.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I mean, I feel like
it's more grown-up.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
we turned to the one place that might tell us what we need:

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
I need to head home.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
: Welcome, sports fans,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I wanna do
more bad things.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Like, having
tighter clothes

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Wikipedia.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
MAN:
Otis Jenkins?

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
to the 43rd biannual Wushung/Woodcrest Junior/Senior

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
No, man, I'm out.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
is gonna make people
take me more seriously.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
We're from the
Internal Revenue Service.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Okay, let's see here.
"Old and blind.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I said I wanna do
more bad things. Come on!

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
It's really gonna happen.
It's all gonna be better now.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Toodles!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Harmonious Kickball Tournament.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
"Worst human being ever.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yo, what's wrong
with you, man?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Both teams on the field and already there seems to be

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
"Killed by Robert Freeman.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I said I'm through,
I'm going home.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
It's all gonna be better.
Right, honey?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Damn! Damn! Damn!

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Pussy.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Came back from the dead."

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Riley.
Man, I'm sorry.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Tom, I'm trying
to watch this.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
some type of trouble.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Seems like the owner of the Wushung team

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Wait. Look at this.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Look, we ain't gotta do
nothing else,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Yo, yo, yo, I heard
the presidential limo

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
"In his younger years,
Colonel Stinkmeaner

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
RILEY: This is how

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
the operation worked.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
is accusing one of the Woodcrest players

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
let's just go back to my house
and watch movies.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
is gonna be like a crazy
pimped out Cadillac now,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
"belonged to a crew
of violent hoodlums

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Kids signed up to be sellers on our website,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
of being a ringer. The rules say

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
All right, fine.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
known as the Hateocracy.
Colonel H. Stinkmeaner--"

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
and they parents sent the money

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
with rims and, like,
machine guns and lasers.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
any player must be a resident of Wushung or Woodcrest.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
to a PayPal account.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
STINKMEANER: Gimme this shit, little nigga.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
It's my story.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Excuse me.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
He is absolutely
a resident.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I'd like to propose
a toast.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Is this
the Freeman residence?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
We paid off store owners for they old candy.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Here is his hot Caucasian wife
and half-Asian baby.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Now my boy, Lord Rufus Crabmiser,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Depends,
you asking for money?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Now I'd just
like to say

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Once the candy was delivered to the seller,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Lady Esmerelda Gripenasty,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
No, I'm--
Jehovah's Witness?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
that today is a very
special day for me.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
No--
Police?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
it was time for them to go sell.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
and Mr. George Pissedofferson

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I hope you all are enjoying
the cheese, wine

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
ANNOUNCER: And now the Woodcrest team

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
is making a complaint.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
No, sir. But there is
an urgent matter

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
And, man, did they sell.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I need to speak
with you about.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
They sold after school, on weekends,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
met at the Better Pastures Retirement Home.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
It's about your grandson.
May I come in?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Looks like the Wushung team has one too many adult members.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
and freedom I have struggled
so hard to provide tonight.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Now we hated each other right away.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
day, night, rain, sleet, whatever.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
S-Sure.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Everybody knows Junior/Senior Tournament rules

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
But we hated everyone else even more.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Parents were the best customers.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
And because of my pain
and suffering,

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
My name is Dr. Doomus.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
The fundraiser kept their kids occupied

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
say the roster must have an equal number

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh, yum.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I am a school counselor
at Point Pleasant Elementary.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
the black struggle
is officially over.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Swipe.
Jell-O jack, nyukka.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
and even had them making they own money,

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
of kids and adults.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I want you to know
that Lamilton

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
Dolo is strong and healthy
like many kids in China,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
but it wasn't just about money.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
No longer can they
keep us down.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
is no ordinary
juvenile delinquent.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
It was about winning.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
No longer can we
be silenced--

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
How much you owe?
Man, them motherfuckers

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Not again.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
He is something far,
far worse.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
We had parents violating company policy

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
but I assure you he is only
12 years old.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Shh! This is it!
Shut up! Shut up!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
want me to pay a 121,000
in the next six weeks

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
: A 9. A 9.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Far worse?
How far worse?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
just to get they kids' numbers up.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And now we have the returns

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
or they gonna take my house.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I first met Lamilton
three years ago,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
We had grown adults actually risking they jobs

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
from the West Coast coming in here.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Look, I told you
what you need to do.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Here is the official keeper
of government records

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
when he started
kindergarten.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Okay. And so yes, folks, we are calling it.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I know, man,
but I'm saying, a job?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Bingo, sucker!

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
I saw this 5-year old child
with a blank,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
by trying to push bars on their co-workers.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
to verify that fact.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
ESMERALDA:
Turn your ass around

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
and look at your damn card.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And it didn't cost me nothing.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I mean, wasn't that the point
of us being rappers,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Barack Hussein Obama will be

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
emotionless face
and eyes that had

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
It was beautiful.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
so we wouldn't have
to get a job? Look, man.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
ANNOUNCER: Heh! Looks like the ref

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Now what the fuck I win,
nyukka?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
the next President of the United States.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
You shouldn't have given up
so easily.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
A, um-- Ahem.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
absolutely no compassion
in them.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
MAN: Yes!

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
is gonna let it slide. Tough break for the home team.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Subscription
to  Reader's Digest?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Once they finally sold through that candy,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
If you and Mack
were still here--

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Gimme that shit, nigga.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
No conscience whatsoever.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
they give us the cash, we give them they cut

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Obama! Obama!

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Otis, it's over.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I spent the first year
trying to help him,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Obama!
Yeah, Obama!

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
We were lucky, man.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Play kickball.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
and another box of chocolate bars.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
and the last two years

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
For the first time in my life,
I am proud to be an American.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
We had a great time,
we got to be rock stars,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
ANNOUNCER: Huey Freeman on the mound.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
trying to have him
locked away forever

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
And the whole thing starts all over again.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
and see some shit that most
people never get to see.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
with no hope of release.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
There is a lot of excitement about this young man's return

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Move out the way,
bitch!

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
But it's over.
You got a degree, nigga.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Because I realized

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah!

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
that what was living
behind that boy's eyes was...

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
You got options.
That's more than most people.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
to the sport of kickball.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
We expanded into other neighborhoods.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Little Ming Do steps up to the plate.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Other schools were happy

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Why, Lord?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
ALL:
Obama! Obama!

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
What a treat to see these two titans of the game

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
not human.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
to take the same deal as Hoover.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
STINKMEANER: Eventually, they couldn't

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
take us no more

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Aw, man. I knew it.
I should have never listened

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Soon, we had set up competitions

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Obama!

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
I can get you
in the door, man.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
face off against one another.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
and they kick us the fuck out.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
to that old woman and her old
bullshit-ass sob story.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Think about it.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Let's go, Huey!

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
between local schools

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Obama.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
to see who could raise the most money.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Show them what's good,
Huey!

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
My crew roam the Earth

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Now we have to kill him
before he kill us.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
whooping niggas' asses for a decade and then we split up.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Exactly right.
No. Wait.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And no matter who won,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
MAN:
Okay, Mr. Otis Jenkins.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
What? Some people just gotta
die, that's all I'm saying.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
we won.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
ANNOUNCER: Huey looks absolutely

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
determined out there folks--

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Colonel H. Stinkmeaner...
"...died years later

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
So you wanna kill him
for something he might do.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Says here you have a bachelor's
degree in communications.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Oh! Hello! And goodbye!

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
in a street fight with Robert
Freeman from Woodcrest."

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Hey. You can't do that.
That money is for the animals.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Well, you a doctor.
If you say we should kill him

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, but, uh, I don't normally
go by my government name.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
And that one is out of here. Not a good start for Freeman.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Hey, that-- That's me.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
for our own health,
doesn't that mean

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Come on, Jazmine,

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
So you can just call me
Thugnificent.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
"Once notified
of Stinkmeaner's death,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
we're allowed to kill him?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I can call you
Thugnificent?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
we allowed to spend
some of it on ourselves.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
You suck, Huey!

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
"the surviving members
of the Hateocracy reunited

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I wish. They won't even
lock him up.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
You've never heard my music? I
thought Flo would've told you.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
You worthless
motherfucker.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Call it operating expenses.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
to enact revenge
on the Freeman family."

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
They want to wait

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Don't worry, they gonna be

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
ANNOUNCER: Next kicker is Lily Chang,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
until an innocent person
gets hurt first.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
NARRATOR: It is days before inauguration,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
We were in
the Lethal Interjection Crew.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Oh, this is terrible.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
plenty of money left
for the animals.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
By "Flo",
you mean Derrick?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
a 73-year-old retired farm worker with diabetes.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
What did I do
to deserve this?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
But it's only
a matter of time.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Are you sure?

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
and Obama Mania is at a fever pitch.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
You must protect Riley.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Uh, you killed a nigga.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Well, I've already told Riley

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
No, he didn't
mention that.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Folks, she's experiencing complete kidney failure.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
How's it going?

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
I return to Woodcrest to check on the Freemans.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Rappers, you say?
Oh, yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
What that got to do
with anything?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
he can't be friends
with Lamilton,

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Hasn't peed in three years.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Eventually they're gonna
find out where we live.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
so that's that.
He wouldn't dare.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Fine. Great.
Don't tell me nothing.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
We did a song called
"Fuck Granddad", uh,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
This might just be the warm-up that Freeman needs.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Why me?
Man, I say we go out there

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Believe that.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
All right,
but you should know

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
I don't necessarily think
of myself as a hero.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
about fucking up
old people.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
No, Mr. Freeman.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
that Jazmine is going--
La-la-la-la!

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Did a song called
"Stomp 'Em in the Nuts",

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And here's the pitch.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
and ride
on these fools.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Riley is with Lamilton
as we speak.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Yes. Let's kill them
before they kill us.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Not listening.
I'm not listening.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
And when people always
ask me if I want a medal

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
which was, ironically, about
stomping niggas in the nuts.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
That's a plan
that can't go wrong.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
You know, real shit.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
What if it doesn't end there,
Granddad?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
or a monument or a statue
in my honor, I say,

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
This could go on forever.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Watch out there,
Goldilocks.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
"No, mm-mm. Mm-mm."

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
ANNOUNCER: Oh, mother!

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I'm telling you,
Granddad,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Derrick neglected
to mention this on his resume.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
All that chocolate can be bad
for your health.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
All I want to do
is be there in person,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I know exactly
how to handle this.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
on that glorious day,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, music is in our blood,
man, that's what we do.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Yo, why you watch
this stuff all the time?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
They wanna go to war,
I'll take them niggas to war.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Say what?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
when the first black president
take the oath.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
You know, we just
in a transitional period

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
What the hell
do you call this?

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
I'm trying, all right?
Get your shit together.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I like watching people
get hurt.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I just want to stand in the
crowd, somewhere in the front,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
with our career right now,
so, anything we do now

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
What's up, partner?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
It looks fun to me.
I wanna hurt people.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
RILEY: The operation needed

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
more space,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
maybe in the VIP section,
maybe next to Beyoncé.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
would just be temporary.
Derrick too, I presume?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Kicker up.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Ed, stop. That ain't them.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
ANNOUNCER: Huey's not having the best

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
so we moved to a hotel downtown.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Hell, yeah.
Flo is my nigga.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
day of his life here today, folks.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Are you aware
that some people are paying

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
As soon as I'm back on,
he's back on, you know.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Let's see if he can't get it together.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Reap the whirlwind,
you sick bastard.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And this is
the Scarface Suite.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
as much as $50,000
for VIP inauguration tickets?

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Strike! Throws one and strike.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Pow! We out of here.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Ed, stop. Stop!

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Whatever, nigga,
it's getting late.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Good to know.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
And another strike.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Wait, I wanna
show you something.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
They're just getting it
cleaned up for you.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Well, I don't think you can put
a price on decades of struggle.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Ed, stop!

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Hey, Flo. Hey, I didn't know
that he didn't know--

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
Huey Freeman is getting that pitching arm warmed up now,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It's my grandmother's.
Hold on.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Did you contribute any money
at all to the Obama campaign?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Okay, that didn't work.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
This'll do perfect.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Flo. Come on, man,
don't be like that.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Well,
at least you tried.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
and that is two back-to-back strikeouts.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Flo. I didn't know, Flo!

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Some people think
we should just sit here

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Hey, boy.
You got a sec?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I paid 10 bucks
for this T-shirt.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
and wait to be killed.
Shoot.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I love you, man.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
It's about your, uh,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Did you get that from
the campaign website?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
We need protection.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Ugh.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
No homo.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
But there's only one person
who can help us now.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Hey, Riley, check this out.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
fundraising. Who exactly
are you raising

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
No, I got it from the guy
at the car wash,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
ANNOUNCER: Dolo steps up to the plate.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
all that money for?

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
but it's still free advertising
when I wear it outside.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Yo, yo, man, watch
where you point that thing.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
And we've been waiting for this matchup all day and--

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Because Huey said--

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
LEONARD:
Man, I don't know

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
what we gonna do.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Granddad,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
A lot of people
see me in this shirt.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
We all knew
it was gonna come to this.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
My grandmother
has it in case of burglars.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Oh, look at that!

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
'cause I really wanna hear
what you have to say.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I mean, before
we change the world,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Yes?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
She told me never to touch it
so I'm touching it.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
we gotta change
ourselves first.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
LEONARD:
Yo, is that what I think it is?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That's gonna leave a mark...

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
But I got something
I want you to see right quick.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I mean, this is
the new colorless,

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
HUEY: Uh, yeah. Is this

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Mr. Bushido Brown?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Man, you need
to be careful with that.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
It's outside.
Huey, you can come too.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
You ain't never seen
no yayo?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
in his pants.
Damn!

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Now, see,
you done already messed up.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
flavorless and unscented era.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Now we can do anything we want.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Like, from now on, I'm calling
all my niggas "Obamas."

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Yes, I'm just trying
to figure out what this is.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Good job, boy. This game is more
important than you.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
My name is Grand Master
Bushido Brown.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
We can take whatever we want.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
That's real cocaine, nigga.
Hm. Where'd you get it?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And we can hurt
whoever we want.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And all my bitches
I'm calling "Michelles."

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Someone get him
some Demerol.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
And if you ain't
got no money,

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
Nigga, don't worry about where
I got it. I got my connects.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
this about to be a real
short conversation, you dig?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Let's go.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Think about it.
If you was a bitch, right,

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
And make sure
it's the good stuff.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Yo, you trippin'.
I'm going home.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
would you rather be called
a "bitch" or "Michelle"?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
ANNOUNCER: In the kicker's box right now

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Aah! Is that a Gibbs Aquada?

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
GRANDDAD:
Uh, how was your flight,

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
uh, Mr. Brown?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Ed the Third.
So what are you doing with it?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Yeah, yeah.
The car that turns

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
And what about
bitches named Michelle?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
is Huey Freeman, the pride of Woodcrest.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I said let's go.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
"So what are you doing with it?"

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah!

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
into a boat,
and then back into a car.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
We gonna cook it up,
slang it on them streets,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
First class was
comfortable, I hope?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Man, you making jokes. I'm
trying to uplift my Obamas.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
ANNOUNCER: Everyone's cheering.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Here he goes.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
For me?
Oh, I can't believe it.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
and get paid, nigga.
How do we do that?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Your time is running out.
What's the job?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
He locks in and the ball is coming up--

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Thank you, boy. Oh,
you're the best grandson ever.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I mean, how hard can it be?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
He's got a-- Little bit girly,

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
There are some people
out to get us.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
We need protection
around the clock.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
I think
there's some rap songs

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
but it'll get the job done.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Way better than that other one.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
that tell you how to do it,
right?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Man, I work for people
with real money.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Yes, can you tell
the president-elect

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Next up is Riley Freeman.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Judging from this place, y'all
can't even afford Bushido Brown.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Uh, yeah, you wanted
to talk to me about something?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
it's Civil Rights legend
Robert Freeman.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
I don't wanna hear
no more excuses,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Wait a min--
Hold on, what's this?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I want that little
psycho bastard

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
F-R-E-E-M-A-N, who struggled
to open the door

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
We'll pay
whatever it costs.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Uh, nothing. Nothing,
mm-mm. Never mind.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Oh, my. His first time at the plate

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
out of our lives for good.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
How much it gonna cost?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
That's that.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Oh, I can't believe it.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Okay, he said something
about baking soda.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
How much
is your life worth?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Time for me to lay down the law.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I'm gonna be just like
James Bond now.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
for him to be president.
You got all that?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
and he's calling a home run.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
No, see, I'm asking you

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Damn. Man, this shit don't
actually say how to make it.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
James Bond, hey

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Right. Just tell him
I'm calling again

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
And Ming lets go with a fireball.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
how much your bodyguard
services are gonna cost.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Oh, what the hell,
let's check Wikipedia.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And I'm asking you how much
your life is worth, Jack.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Hey boy, listen up.
You know what, Granddad?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Riley's got his eye--

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
about those tickets.
Again.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
I been hanging out
with Lamilton

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Hey, man,
I got that Obama water.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Strike!

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
STINKMEANER: Bushido Brown's services

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
even though you told me not to,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
and I don't think
I'm gonna do that no more.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Change the way
you hydrate, brother.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Strike two!

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
came with a whole lot of bullshit.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Riley, we got problems.
Big problems.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Strike three!

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I just need to go up
to my room where I belong,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Yo, little man.
Hey, hey, check it out.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Good grief.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
The first was that he got to sleep in Robert's bed.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
no TV, no dinner, no nothing.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
World's Ultimate Chocolates.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I got commemorative plates,
two for 20.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Robert the bitch-ass Freeman had to fly out

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I might even need
to whoop myself.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
They came by my office today.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
How many you need?
I'm cool.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
They're mad. I mean,
they're really mad.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
ANNOUNCER: Tom's up.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
He's getting a good stretch on.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Goodnight, y'all.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
You believe in a few days we're
gonna have a black president?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
two personal assistants, a cook,

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
So, what? I'm supposed
to be scared of

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
a bunch of guys
who make candy?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
We don't expect a whole lot out of this Tom guy, but--

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Aren't you excited,
little man?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
and a spiritual advisor all first class,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Well, you better
not break my belt.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Well, they scared me.
I mean, I'm done, Riley.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Eh.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
ANNOUNCER: Apologizing here.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
I'm-- I'm out.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
"Eh"?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
all of whom stayed at their house.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, I was tired
of paying your punk ass

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
What's "eh"
supposed to mean?

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Tom is really putting this relay right back to Ming.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Heh-heh. Them niggas had to sleep in the living room.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
to do nothing anyway.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Just means "eh."

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
What the deal man?
What's going on here?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
She locks in, Tom is in midst of celebration.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
The garage was converted into a workout room,

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Where you been, Riley?

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Uh, I-I-- I been real busy.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
MAN: Yo, what's deal?
I asked this kid

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
if he was excited about Obama
and he said "eh".

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Pardon me,
are you selling crack?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
He can do no wrong.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Uh, what it look like
I'm doing?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
which only Bushido Brown was allowed to use.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
When are we gonna hang out
again and do bad things?

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
You see, uh,
Tom all it takes is good,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
"Eh"? He said "eh"?
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Oh, looks like it's lights out for Tom.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Here.
Oh, lovely, lovely.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
He also required 1200 thread count sheets,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Well, my granddad
won't let me, all right?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
What's wrong with you?
You not excited?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
solid grandparenting.
Look at him.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Not excited?
Who ain't excited?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I'll take two, please.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
He says we can't be
friends no more.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
He's working hard,
taking the initiative.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Folks, Ming is really giving the crowd here

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
This little nigga.
Why ain't he excited?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
imported Wagyu Kobe beef from Japan,

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Well, I say
we're still friends.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Jazmine just bought me
a flat screen.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
You don't like Obama.
You want McCain to win.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
quite a lesson in kickball today.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Okay, but my granddad
says we not.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Thank you.
Have a wonderful day.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
and a Tushioki hands-free auto-cleaning toilet,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
And this.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
I never said that--
Why ain't you like Barack Obama?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Ooh, that's nice.
I know.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Mr. Freeman steps up.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Well, I say we are.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
all at Robert's expense.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
So come on.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
He got
a lovely family.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
He's gonna give it all he's got.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
But it just seems
like they're making

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Not according
to this little nigga.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Excuse me, man,
I'm looking for some crack.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
They found themselves in the fucked up position

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
an awful lot of money.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
He got a problem
with a black president.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And he does give it all he's got,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Granddad, you have to try

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
of wishing my crew

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Boy, what's going on?
What did I tell you

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Uh, yeah.
Got your crack right here.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
which frankly just is not a lot.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
and stop Riley
before it's too late.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
Wait a minute.
You're Thugnificent! Oh, my God.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
would try to whoop they asses even sooner.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
At least Riley loves
his granddaddy enough

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
about talking to anybody
about anything?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Quite anemic,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
: Leranze, your break is over.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Whose house is this?

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I didn't say anything.
I ought to kick your ass.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
It's Betty Von Hausen's.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
to buy him stuff.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
but Mr. Freeman's gonna make it to first base soon as he can.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
She an evil old white woman

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
What have you
ever bought me, huh?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Oh, excuse me.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Everybody,
just calm down.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
No, no, it's you.
It's definitely you.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Looks like he's gonna take one of those

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
with a whole bunch of guns.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
You need to be more
like your brother,

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Make a hole, darkies.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
and try to make the world
a better place for me.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Just what the hell
is going on here?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Oh, man,
I love your stuff, man.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
"old people walking around the mall" leisurely strolls.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Why? What do you wanna
do to her?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Ruckus?
Oh, no.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
What are you doing
out here selling crack?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Excuse me for a second,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Rob it.
Take all her stuff.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I have to use
the latrine.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
This little big-haired
nigga hates Obama.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I'm not Thugnificent.
I'm an ordinary crack dealer.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I'm out. Yep, I'm out.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Rob it? Hell, no.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
RILEY: World's Ultimate Chocolates

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
started playing rough.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And I say good for him.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Stop being scared.
Man, this is stupid.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Leave this little boy alone.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Can you please give me
the crack? I need three.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
ANNOUNCER: There he goes.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
We both gonna go
to jail for this.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
The message was clear. They wanted us out.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Lights out for the old man.
You're out!

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
He telling the truth.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Dude,
what happened on your last CD?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
They can't send me to jail.
I've been on TV.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Barack Obama
is an evil man.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
You're so much better than that.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
No, wait! Stop!

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
They intimidated our suppliers...

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I'm a superstar.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Get out of here.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Hey, everybody,
just calm down.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Don't know
what you talking about.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
The schools...
Hey.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Can y'all hold this off
for a minute? Crack--

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
ANNOUNCER: These folks are giving the

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Americans quite a schooling.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
It's only 30 seconds late.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
You heard us.
You say "Yes, we can."

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
What was that?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Everybody.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I mean, a couple of the beats
were okay, but Auto-Tuner?

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Bushido! No,
don't do that, Bushido!

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Hey!

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
We got an easy out now and the ball...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
We say,
"No, you can't, nigga."

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
The Auto-Tune is fucked up.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
MAN: Fucking little shit. Well, almost everybody.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh, looks like we don't have an easy out.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, snap. Aah!

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
MAN:
Oh, hell no!

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
The Auto-Tune is terrible.
Look, I'm not Thugnificent!

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Leave him alone, Bushido!
Bushido Brown.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Oh! Me fucking knackers!

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
RUCKUS:
Ow! I can't see!

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I don't know what's going on here,

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Now, get the fuck away
from me.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Don't do it, Brown.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Yo, I'm serious!
Uh, excuse me, sir.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
but this American team has lost its wheels.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Come here, boy.
I got something for you.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It's a monkey stampede!

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
GRANDDAD: That's my car!

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I'd like to return this crack.
What?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Now they got a hit, we got a runner,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Yo, man, forget this.
Lamilton, you on your own.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Race war!
Somebody get him!

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
he's being pelted with shoes.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I can't stand
this waiting.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
MAN: Come here.
Aah! Help!

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I haven't gotten mine,
and you bringing shit back.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Nice tennis shoes, by the way.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I don't know how much longer
I can afford this guy.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Idiots.
Get in the car quick.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I said I would like
to return this crack.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Why don't they try
to kill us already? Damn.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
JEFF:
Let me go.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
RILEY:
Drive! Drive! Go, Granddad!

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
This ain't Walmart.
There ain't no return policies,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Probably made by tiny little hands in a Chinese factory.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
How do we know
those crazy old coots

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
no motherfucking exchanges!

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Now the Chinese have--

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
are still even after us?
Maybe they went home,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
No, no, it is defective
Look, it's all burnt up.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Now that-- Okay, that is just wrong.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Oh, shit.
Yo, yo we gotta go.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
NARRATOR: The American press struggles

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Now that is three-on-one, and that's horrible.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
or died of old age,
or something.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Look, singed around the edges.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
That bullshit-ass toilet
you bought just broke.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
to comprehend the incident.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Ain't nothing wrong with
this crack. Good crack.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Come on.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
JEFF:
No, no, no!

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Please, no.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
To them, Huey is like a calf

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Ain't shit happening
with my crack.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I paid you good money
for this game.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
You mean it won't flush?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Did I say
it won't flush?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
that refuses its mother's udder,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
You not good at this, 'cause my
crack dealer is a lot faster.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah? So did he.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
The hands-free
cleaning system won't work.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
choosing instead to drink the bitter waters

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
All right,
we just gonna stay cool

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Are you gonna be here
for a while?

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
I'll take
the Chinese money.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I told you to get
the Tushioki 2200 series.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
What you shoot the dog for?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I mean, I'd like to go get
my cousin. He's a huge fan.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
and keep doing what we doing.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
of its own making.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
You got the 1100 series

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Hey, he got loose.
He was about to bite me.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Here is the danger of too much hope.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
WUNCLER:
Listen, I don't care the refs

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
are cheating.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
And just ignore all this?
Come on, man.

15:05.000 --> 15:05.000
Don't go get your--

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
and the 1100 series
is some bullshit.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
You lying.
He was chained up.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Skeptics are treated like blasphemers,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
No, no, wait--
Look, there is no reason

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
These guys ain't no gangstas,
they make chocolate.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
to be rude, I paid good money
for this crack

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
We cannot lose this game.
The stakes are too high.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Well, they didn't have
the 2200 series.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
That's your problem. You better
have a replacement

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Man, you sick.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
and indifference becomes equal to hate.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
and it is all burnt up!
Look!

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Well, who bet the whole town
on a kickball game?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I think you don't wanna
be friends no more.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
KID: See, I told you!
Look, see?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
before I have
to take a shit again.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
One four-foot long slab
of chocolate

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Okay, maybe it was
a wrong decision

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Well, what if I can't get
the replacement in time?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I think you gonna tell on me
for shooting a dog.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
for Riley Freeman.
Sign right here, nigga.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Sir, sir, sir,
you're not even looking.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
to bet all of our economic
futures on a kickball game,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Hey, I don't care
if you wipe it,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Man, I ain't no snitch.
But you got problems, yo.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Oh, my God,
it is Thugnificent,

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Robert Freeman calls a press conference

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
but Bushido Brown
don't wipe his own ass.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I can't believe it.
Can I take your picture?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Just stay away from me, man.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
but we're Americans.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Nigga, did you just tell me
to wipe your ass?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
to do damage control.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
No! Don't you-- Ni--

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
We don't quit
just because we're wrong.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Riley. Riley!

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Huey Freeman
is not really my grandson.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Don't you see
I'm selling crack?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Huh?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
We just keep doing the wrong
thing until it turns out right.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Could I just get mine and go?
I was supposed to pick up

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
That's it, you fired.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
You firing Bushido Brown?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I refute, renounce,
and rebuke him.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
my daughter from school
eight hours ago.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
This is stupid.
I'm going home.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Clear his mouth.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
You heard me.
You and all these raggedy

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I hope this incident
in no way affects my request

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Now, if you don't give me
some new crack, or a refund,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
What about them, Huey?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Uh, help me. Get me out of here.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
motherfuckers you brought
with you get the fuck on.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Your teammates.
You got them into this.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
: Lamilton Taeshawn

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
was apprehended today

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Who did this?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
for VIP inaugural tickets,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I, sir, will take
my business elsewhere.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I'm sick of this shit.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
They said-- They said
they were from

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
and/or slash the inaugural ball
with Beyoncé.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Will you motherfuckers
get away from me?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Now you're turning your back
on them?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
for shooting a Woodcrest resident's dog.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
World's Ultimate Chocolates.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
We gotta make
the motherfuckers pay.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Now, you do understand
there's no refunds

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah, boy. They got him.
Ha-ha!

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
They wanted me to give you
a message

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
that this was just
the beginning.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Rosa Parks
is no longer with us,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Man, Leonard, who do I know
that still does cocaine?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Come on, I don't want
to play no more neither,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
for early termination
on our agreement.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Whatever, nigga.
Beat it.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
They finally got him.
Boys, come quick.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Oh, God, it was so scary.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
but I consider myself to be
the next best thing.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
but we can't go out
like a bunch of little bitches.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Think, think, think. Oh!

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
He shot Betty Von Hausen's dog.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
I wanna go home now.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
In many ways, better.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Granddad?
I'm trying to save my house

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
What?
Me too. I quit too.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Yo, Steve. Steve
from Hollow Point Records.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Oh, I always hated that dog.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
and my big-titty porn.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Why, 'cause he got
dipped in chocolate?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
NARRATOR:
Where is your wife?

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
Yo, that nigga does cocaine
and he got a lot of paper.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Wait.
I changed my mind.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
It's up to you, Huey.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
REPORTER: Even though he's only

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
8 years old,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Big deal, he's a kid.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
The sooner you stop
holding back

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Too late, old man.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
She's in, uh, D.C.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Too late.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
police decided to arrest Lamilton

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
That sounds like something
most kids

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
There was a problem or
something with the tickets,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
and decide to play
like a winner,

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
would want to have happen.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Hey, yo, Steve.
Uh, it's your boy, Otis.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
so they can get him into the system

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Eat your way out of it,
nigga, take a bath.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
so we only had one
and I let her have it.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
the sooner we can all go home.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Now, if you want to hire me
again, I might be available.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
and get him the help he so desperately needs.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Are you afraid
your wife will have

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Um, look,
I got some stuff you, uh,

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Let's get back
to getting this money.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Okay, fine.
For double the fee.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
He's in the system.
Oh, how I love the system.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
lusty sex
with Barack Obama?

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
might be interested in.
Ha-ha.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
ANNOUNCER: Woodcrest really needs

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
something

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
No way. This is too weird.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Double the fee?
But I've already paid you!

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
What? No!

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
happening for them today, because this Chinese team

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Let's hope they keep his ass
in the system forever.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
No doubt, no doubt.
Yeah, just, uh,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Hey, this ain't
a negotiation.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
tell me when and where.
I'll be there, nigga.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
is really owning their a-- Oh!

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Whoo! My tax dollars
hard at work.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
No. That's impossible.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Take it or leave it.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I didn't ask
if it was possible,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
If I was you,
I'd take it.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Whoo!
That's some good news.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
only if you were afraid.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
ANNOUNCER:  Now we're talking!

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
System, system

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Granddad, you have to listen.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I can't help but notice
you are like a less attractive,

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Okay, fine.
Damn it.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
That's the Huey Freeman this city has fallen in love with

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Stay in the system, yeah

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Do not get into that car.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It's a car-boat,
thank you very much.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
less wealthy, less powerful
version of him.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
So you know this guy,
and he definitely got the money?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
and feared slightly too, I gotta admit that.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Now get out the way.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Hell, yeah. The nigga runs
the label I almost signed with.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Folks, we got us a game all of a sudden here.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
It is quite understandable
for you to be concerned.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
But don't be trying
no dumb shit though, man,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
You're wondering
how they found out

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
NEWSCASTER: Celebrities, dignitaries

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
and Civil Rights legends

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Aha, yes.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
'cause Steve's
a little crazy.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
The legendary
Bushido Brown.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Lamilton shot that dog.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
No, he better not be trying
no dumb shit,

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
No!

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
are arriving in droves for the inauguration of Barack Obama.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I told them.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
'cause I'm a little crazy.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Folks, we're ready to get back
into the action here,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
The greatest black karate man
to ever live.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
But how did you know?
I was following you

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Anyone hoping to get tickets at this point, don't bother.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
That's Grand Master
Bushido Brown.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
and Lamilton.
I saw what happened.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
but there's no ref.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
No, that's my boat! You wanna be in this business,

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
You here to see Steve?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I know he forced you
to be there against your will.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
The ship has sailed and you are not on it,

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Of course it is.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
you gotta pay the cost of doing business.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
The fuck you think.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Well, why didn't you give
the cops your name?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Come on in.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And when the cost get too high,

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
because you are not important.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
A year ago,
Lamilton's grandmother

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Hey, Granddad,
this was at the door.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
So this is it.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Ooh, ooh...

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
you get out of business.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
This is your ultimate contest?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
ESMERALDA:
Come on, boy. Come on.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
filed a restraining order
against me.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
"Office of the president-elect?"

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
In China,
there is this place.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I ain't scared of you.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Said I was obsessed.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
You always gotta spoil
something, huh? Man.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Ha! Otis, what's popping?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
I've never seen it,
but I know it exists.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Disturbed. Icky.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
: "Mr. Freeman.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Glad you could make it,
man.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
RILEY:
You like that, old lady?

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Aw, man. Now he gonna
think I snitched.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
"Please find enclosed two VIP tickets to the inauguration,

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Yo, what up, Steve?
These are my friends, uh,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It is called the Glorious Sports
Rehabilitation Center.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Leonard and Ed the Third.
Great to meet you.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
I was going to the hotel to shut down the operation.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
"as well as the inaugural ball with Beyoncé,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
But really it's a prison camp for athletes

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Don't you understand?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Sit down.
Anybody want anything?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
He's in the system.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
"as a small token of gratitude for all the sacrifices

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
He can't hurt you now.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
But I wasn't sure what I had started

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
who have shamed their country by losing.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
How you been, Otis?
Not too good, to be honest.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
They're going to lock
him away forever.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
could be stopped.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
"you've made on behalf of me and this great country.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
My grandfather told me if I disgrace him with failure,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
With no hope of release.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I heard you lost your deal.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
"I look forward to sharing this historic day with you.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm glad you called me.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
he will send me there.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
TEACHER:
And so we carry the one...

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I too dream of the day

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I think people are getting sick
of all of it, you know?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
I can walk away
from this game forever.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Sincerely, President-Elect Barack Obama."

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
You, Sergeant Gutter,
everything music's been

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
TEACHER:
...and now we add one

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
to seven and three.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Huh?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I am not as lucky as you

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
for the last decade.
It's a new era, now.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
to have that choice.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
People want something more.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
To live in America.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
What's going on?
I'm going to the inauguration.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah, you probably right.
But I believe in you, Otis.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
LONG DO: Ming!

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
ESMERALDA:
I want this nigga to fight me.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Holy shit! Look!

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Hey, look, here brother.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
You wanna come?
Yeah, boy!

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Always have.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Thanks, man. I appreciate that.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Come on, fight like a man,
you little punk bitch.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Riley.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Can you spare, uh,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
NARRATOR: And just like that,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
some money
for a starving African?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Now, let's get down
to business.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
I'll bet your ass--

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
virtually foaming at the mouth with unbridled excitement,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
He was just there, I swear.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Hey, you never know
when you might need

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
You got something for me?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Tragically,
we've just received word

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
some good karma, now.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Oh! My wig.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Riley Freeman,
I have no patience

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Robert and Riley leave for the inauguration.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
That's about a key.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
that the ref
strangled himself,

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
RILEY: First rule of fundraising:

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
for your potty mouth today.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Don't give nothing to nobody.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Maybe an eight-ball
short though.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
jumped off a bridge, then overdosed on amphetamines.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Heh-heh.
What is this, cocaine?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I'll see you in detention.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
RILEY:
Whoop that trick.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
But I ain't no fundraiser no more.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Yeah.
I, uh, thought

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh, send my condolences
to his family.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
DOOMUS:
Mr. Freeman,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I have terrible news.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
You are looking at the final mission

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Thank you so very much,
brother.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
we were gonna discuss
a record deal, not a drug deal.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
of a domestic terrorist.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
But fortunately,
we've found a completely fair

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
They've let him go.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Unjambo,
and good luck to you.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Huh?
You said you had something

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Operation Exodus.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah!
Yeah!

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Who, Lamilton?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
I might be interested in

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
and impartial replacement.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Yes.
But I thought he was

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
Convinced he has no place in Obama's America,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
and I thought you were
talking about music.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
in the system. The fools let him go.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Hey, there, Chairman Mao.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Oh, man.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
He's out of the system?
Oh, no!

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
RILEY:
Get him.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Huey Freeman decides to leave the country for good.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I want back into
the Thugnificent business.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Open up your eyes and let's play
some Jap baseball.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Huey, he's out of the system.
Grab my shotgun.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Hope you don't mind.
We made some tea.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
How about $150,000 advance?

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
And he has an unlikely companion.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
ANNOUNCER: Freeman on the mound,

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
GRANDDAD:
Duck down!

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
They said they didn't have enough evidence to hold him.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
What? Are you serious?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
150,000?
You got that kind of money?

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
and he must really be feeling the pressure right now.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I was gonna go
to the inauguration

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Of course I got that
kind of money. Who is this guy?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Granddad, what's going on?
Lamilton Taeshawn escaped.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
and try to crown Obama with
a brick, but who am I fooling?

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
GRANDDAD:
Bushido, make your move.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Go grab my pistol
with the silver bullets.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yo! I cannot believe this!

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Yo, I really,
really appreciate this, Steve.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
He's not a werewolf, Granddad.
Shh. Hush, little nigga.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
My arm just ain't
what it used to be.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Plus, that greasy nigga
is really fast.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Yo, like,
this is a miracle!

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Freeman gives up a base kick

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
If Riley is home with you,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Allow me to introduce
myself.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I'm gonna-- I'm not gonna
let you down, man. I promise.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
on what should have been an easy strike-out.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
don't let him
out of your sight.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
And knowing these
liberal activist judges,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Riley's not home, he's in detention.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I'm the bloke
you're stealing from.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
they might actually try
and put me in jail for it.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
You still
want the drugs, right?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
ANNOUNCER: What is going on?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Meet me at the school
right away. We must hurry.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
The name's Alister Rigby,
but as far as you're concerned

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
No. I've been clean
for a year.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
No, I think...

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
You have no idea
what we're dealing with.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Freeman is giving up several crucial base kicks.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I think it's time for me
to leave this great country.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Congratulations, Otis.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm Willy Fucking Wonka,
and you're taking a shit

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Okay, let's go.
Huey, grab the wooden stake.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Thank you so much for believing
in me, Steve, really.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Oh, I can't bear to see it run

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
And my holy water.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
in my fucking
chocolate factory.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
by an African Muslim
Communist Antichrist.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Hey, why does the big-haired kid

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
Easy boss,
don't get upset.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I-I mean, this means
so much to me.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
STEVE:
We're gonna do it right

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
this time.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
suck ass all of a sudden?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I just can't.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
When I have to go
to the dentist,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
It's just like when
Nicole Brown Simpson

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
You're gonna be
back on top.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Ming told him if we lose,

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
I'm upset.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
married that nigga O.J.
back on February 2, 1985.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I came all the way over to this
motherfucker. I want my money.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
we all go to a prison camp!

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
When Liverpool beats Arsenal,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Yo. What the--?
What's up, Riley?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm upset.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
But when some little shit
decides to take over

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
THUGNIFICENT:
I thought we was coming over

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
here to do a crazy drug deal.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
What's wrong with you, man?
Why you sneaking up on niggas?

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
one of the most profitable
territories in the country,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Oh, I knew it was gonna
end badly. I told them.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
He believed that?
What a stupid idiot.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
My heart was beating
all fast.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
And what you doing here?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I told them all.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It turns out you wanna give me
money for a record deal.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
You don't even go
to this school.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
I'm beyond fucking upset.
I'm very fucking upset.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
How come you told on me?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
But nobody wanted to listen

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I want my money.
I got this new sound

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
What a dick.
He's an enormous asshole.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Dynamite.
RILEY: Aw. Ew.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Riley, I thought we was friends.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
to old Uncle Ruckus
then neither.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I been working on too. I want
you to hear it. It's crazy.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
I do not like to be laughed at.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Yo, I ain't tell on you, man,
and this ain't funny no more.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
So from now on, you're under
new management.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
This is gonna make everything
in your life better,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
It is a beautiful day
to fuck shit up.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
I wanna go someplace I'll fit
in, like Norway or Ireland.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Eh?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Stay away from me, all right?
I ain't playing with you.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Hey, did he just--?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
You will work for me,
and in return,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and nothing, anyone can do
is gonna stop it.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
You crazy and you need help.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
HUEY:
What about the Ivory Coast?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
you'll receive an allowance.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I want
my motherfucking money.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Allowance?
Yes, allowance.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Absolutely no Africa!
No way!

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
ANNOUNCER: And a brutal kick

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Ed, what are you doing?
Who cares about drugs?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
ALL:
Oh, shit!

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
All them countries got
nigga presidents,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
takes out the first base runner.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Everybody says I'm crazy,
but I don't care.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
As in, I'm allowing you
to keep 10 percent,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Steve, I'm really sorry,
man.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
which defeats the whole purpose
of leaving this country.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I don't care about
my grandmother,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
What is this, a joke?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Both y'all is out.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
and I'm allowing you

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
NARRATOR:
How do you feel being teamed up

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
with your archenemy?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Or as they say in your language:

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Now what we gonna do?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
I don't care about that dog.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
to keep drawing breath
on this earth.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Do you know who I am?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Aw, man.
We gonna die now.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I don't even care about myself.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Now, you either get down,
or you lay down.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Do you know who I am,
motherfucker?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Yellow nigga.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
This is all your fault,
Granddad.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
And since we ain't crew
no more,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
First of all,
we're not a team.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm Ed Wuncler! I brought
the drugs all the way over here.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
ANNOUNCER: Unbelievable.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
I don't care about you.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Okay, all right, chill,
man. Look.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
What's it gonna be, sunshine?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Second of all,
we're not a team.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I did what I was supposed to do.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Wait. This doesn't have
to end this way.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
We are looking at an altogether different type

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
I-I was tripping, all right?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
RILEY: This wasn't no movie.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I've got gas money,
he's got the license.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I fulfilled my motherfucking
end of the bargain,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Stinkmeaner's death
was a huge mistake,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
of kickball game here today.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
W-We still crew.
Uh, let's go hang out

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
The smart thing was to say yes,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
We're just gonna
drive to Canada

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
and I want my goddamn
money!

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
like we used to.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
get up, and leave the room.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and then go
our separate ways.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Huey with an up in the air over, over and-- Oh!

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
but killing us isn't
gonna bring him back.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Really? You promise?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Hold up, not so fast,
you fat motherfucker!

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
He's right. Look,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Yeah, we'll-- We'll do
whatever you want.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
what happened
with Stinkmeaner,

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Ed, Ed, no, no!
Stop!

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Wow!

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Okay, cool.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
But then I thought to myself,

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
You see, Bill, I consider
myself a black leader now,

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
it shouldn't
have happened, okay?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
what if this was a movie?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Mr. Steve, I hope
this doesn't affect our deal.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Take your base.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Tell me where the safe is,
or the Green Mile over here,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
No? Well, dock this Chink
a day's pay

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
I admit it.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Look. Fuck you,
fuck the plane you flew in on,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
and that means helping Obama
and doing anything he asks.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I was embarrassed 'cause
I got beat up by an old man.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
he's washed up!

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
for napping on the job.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
I was ashamed.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Oh, yes, I can hear
your concern

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I could have walked away
from it then, but I didn't.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
fuck them shoes,
fuck those socks

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
MAN:
I think I'm having

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
a cardiac arrest.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
for the state of the world
in that song you did

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I didn't mean to kill him,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
with the belt on it,
fuck your gay-ass

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
about stomping people
in the nuts.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Oh!
Take your base.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
it just happened.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
fairy faggot accent,
fuck them cheap ass cigars,

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
ANNOUNCER: Oh, my God.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
It's my fault.
I'm sorry.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I've never seen moves like this before.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh, that was the old me.
Everything's different now.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
fuck your yuck-mouth teeth,
fuck your hair-piece,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
There, I've said it.
I'm sorry.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Look out!

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I'm much, much more politically
aware and stuff.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Hey, watch it.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
fuck your chocolate,
fuck Guy Ritchie,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Really? Well, name the three
branches of government then.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
ANNOUNCER: This isn't kickball,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
It was wrong. And I wish I could
take it back, but I can't.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
fuck Prince William,
fuck the queen.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
it's a complete free-for-all.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
The what?
Come on, black leader.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
And neither the coaches nor the referee seem to care.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
So please, please,
can't we just end this?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
This is America.
My president is black

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It's fourth grade
Social Studies time.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
and my Lambo is blue,
nigga.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
What are the three branches
of government?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Now, get the fuck out
my hotel room

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Hold on, hold on.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Uh, let's see.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Your money ain't
worth shit to me,

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Man, we don't give a fuck
about no Stinkmeaner.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
and if I see you
in the street,

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
I'm slapping the shit
out of you.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
They got the main branch.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
so don't waste
your cat-flavored breath.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
What?
What?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Uh...

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Get on your rickshaw
and get out of here.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Just because
he was our nigga,

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
don't mean we gave
a shit about his ass.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
ANNOUNCER: Into the final inning

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
We don't need no reason
to fuck shit up.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
That's it. No more gun.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
If you're a black leader,
I'm glad I'm a white man.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Motherfucker shot me.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
the score is now tied 8 to 8.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I think this one's spent
too much time at the cinema.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
That's why we drink Hennessy,
that's why we smoke menthols,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Now what you gonna do?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
The fuck
you looking at?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Both teams down to a single player,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Teach this cheeky bastard
a lesson.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
You don't want
my goddamn cocaine, huh?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
and years from now people will ask of this game,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
that's why we's niggas.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Well, I'll take my shit
elsewhere.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Nobody fucking move!

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
MAN:
What a moron.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
did it happen?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
We likes to ruin shit.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Aw, man.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
And I say to you now, oh, yes. Yes, it did.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Hell, y'all just
gave us an excuse.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
This is bad.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
If it wasn't you,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
we'd probably just
pick someone at random

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
ALISTER:
What is this, a casting call

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
for  The Sopranos  reunion?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
and ruin their life.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Huh?
Oh, come on.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
What's the point of talking
if nobody ever learns?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Well, now what?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Do me a favor, tell room service
nobody here ordered

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Now you die.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
the extra-large wop
with a side order of wops.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Whoa!

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
OFFICER: Everybody freeze.
Oh, the police.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Jesus Christ, I thought
he'd never shut up.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
With brotherhood

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
This is an outrage.
I have my rights.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Thank God for the poli--
I mean, uh,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on here?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
So you guys are probably
wondering

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
who snitched?
Who called the po-po?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
What's going on over there?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
why we just kicked
in the door

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
Oh, just two niggas
killing each other. Proceed.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
and shot your boss here
in the face.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Oh, them bricks ain't mine.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
OFFICER:
Move it, move it.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Well, to be honest,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Ain't that a surprise.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
it's tough times out there.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
All right,
you three are under arrest

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Already taking away

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
for the murder
of Bushido Brown.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Nobody's spending on nothing.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
my constitutional right
to bear bricks.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
No drugs, no whores,
no gambling, nothing.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Oh, thank you,
officer. Thank you.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Martial law!
Martial law!

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
I can't believe somebody
snitched. That's gay.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Except, apparently,
chocolate bars.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Get your arms off of me.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
OBAMA: We remain a young nation,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
GRANDDAD:
Boy, what on earth

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
are you doing?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
These three won't be
bothering you anymore.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
So consider this
a hostile takeover.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
but in the words of Scripture,

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Now, why do you think
they were after you guys?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
You trying to get
yourself killed?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
We got a problem?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
the time has come to set aside childish things.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I don't know what to do.
Well, get a job.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
It was a nigga moment.
Oh, of course.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Absolutely not.
BOTH: No.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Okay, have a nice day.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I tried that.
Well, try again.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
A nigga moment.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Now get
the fuck out of here.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
You don't understand, Pops.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Well, there's only one way
to end a nigga moment for good.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I always wanted
to do this rap thing.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Jail.
Jail?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
AGENT:
FBI! FBI! Drop your weapons!

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And then, you know,
by some miracle,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Jail. Heh-heh.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
AGENT: Nobody move.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
to choose our part in history.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I actually pulled it off.
I just thought--

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
That makes sense.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
AGENT:
Don't do something stupid.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I just thought
it would last longer.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Jail. Isn't that
great, Huey?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
It ain't over,
Thugnificent.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
MAN:
Don't make me do it.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Jail. Of course.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Lamilton.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Oh, man, this is really bad.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
No! Please!
I have VIP tickets!

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
I believe in you.
You like a musical genius.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh, thank God for jail.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Riley, pull me up.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
MAN: Whose side are you on?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Glad we could help.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I'm trying but you really fat.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
We all got VIP tickets!

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Like-- Like--
Like Ray Charles,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
MAN: We paid you off.
What are you doing here?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
STINKMEANER: And that's the moral

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
of the story.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Riley, don't drop me.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
but without the piano skills

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Hey.
Get your hands off me.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
or the ability to sing
or compose music.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
ANNOUNCER: Wait a minute!

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Some niggas just need to go to jail.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
I'm sorry I tried to kill you.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
All right,
you in trouble now.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I have problems with my anger.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Look, man.
I-I can't do this no more.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
They have literally destroyed the ball.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I might be in hell,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I'm calling my nigga Obeezy.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
but at least I ain't in jail, nigga. Ha-ha-ha!

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
You got problems
with your weight too.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
And those red balls are indestructible.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Thanks, old man.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Unh! Boy!

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Wait. Wait.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Please don't Tase me.
Don't Tase me, bro.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I know I told you
to eat a lot of dicks.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
RILEY: Granddad. Guys, help me.
There he is.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
ANNOUNCER: And look at the determination.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Let me out this car.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
I'm a old man.
I got a heart condition.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
But you all right
with me.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I can't believe
somebody snitched.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I'm coming. Hold on.
Help me, help me get him up.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Ming trying to crawl to first base.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Niggas is out here
like running faucets.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
You can't do this to me!
I'm a Civil Rights legend!

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
DOOMUS:
No. No, you must let him die.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
But what is this?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
GRANDDAD:
Y'all can get

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
off my property now.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
MAN:
Take it down.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Freeman is on his feet.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
And make sure you clean this
headless dickhead off my yard,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Save us, Obama!

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
He's going to tag her out

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Oh, Lord, have mercy!

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
and get that ass-squirting
toilet out of my house too.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
with the smoldering remains of the ball.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
He gone! He gone!

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Jesus,
you answered my prayers.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
NARRATOR: Huey Freeman is forced

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
I'm tickled as a coon
on Inauguration Day.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
You killed him.
He deserved to die.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
It's our chocolate,
motherfucker.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
to abort Operation Exodus

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
because he cannot get a ride.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
He's gone.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
No, wait, he's right there.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
He's still alive?

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
You out, little girl.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
No. No!

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
ANNOUNCER:  And Woodcrest wins!

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
It's all over!

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
MAN 1:  Let's swing it.
MAN 2:  Whoo!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Barack Obama?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
: Candy.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I just found out that fool
is gonna raise my taxes.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Folks, what a moment in history!

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
You're the spawn of Satan.
I must destroy you.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
His promises are just
like his tickets: worthless.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
LONG DO:
Ming. Are you okay?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Candy.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Good thing I didn't vote
for his lying ass.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Get off me. Somebody call
my grandmother.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
How much we got?
What do you mean?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Obama ain't no real nigga.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Don't play with me Jazmine,
the money.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
You're not supposed to be
within a hundred yards.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
And check this out:

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Wait. I know that song!

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
How much money we got?
We don't have any money.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I heard he works
for the feds.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Move them butt

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
Well, that's that.
Let's go home.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
That ain't a good look,
Barack.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
MAN: Ooh, yeah, that's good.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I donated it.
You what?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Move them butt cheeks

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I thought that's what
I was supposed to do.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Washington
was indescribable.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
You gave away the money?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Yo, man.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Who told you to give
away the money?

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
It was just so amazing.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
A deal's a deal, Long.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
You got a cigarette?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
That was the point
of a fundraiser.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And I got to meet him.
NARRATOR: Was he everything

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
No! Why you do that?

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Of course.
I am not saddened at my loss.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
You said it was for charity.
You never give the money away.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
you dreamed he would be?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Oh, yes, he was.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
What's good, lil' homey?
Look, I get off at 5.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
And so much more.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
There are not many worthy
opponents left, my old friend.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Oh, God.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I could come through,
ghost ride the company whip.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Who you give the money to?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Oh, yeah, I'm still down
for the cause and shit,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
How you like
the new job?

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
What fun would it be if the game
were to end for good?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Oh, man,
it's some old bullshit.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Hello, PETA.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
but I'm like, hey, I did my
part, you know what I'm saying?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
But check it,
check it.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I got the nigga elected.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Your boy is shooting
his own reality show.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Time to get back to work,
feel me?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Word?
Yeah, nigga,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Congratulations,
Mr. Wuncler, sir.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Doing what Thugnificent do.
Besides, them tight-ass clothes

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
you on it right now!

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Your great white leadership made
all the difference in the world.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
was cutting off
my circulation.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Yo, what up,
what up, what up?

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Young Reezy,
a.k.a. the Fundraiser, nigga.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Man, why you didn't tell me

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Due to the conditions
of my parole,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Now what should we do
about them?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
she was gonna give away
the money?

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
I am unable to leave
the country at this time.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Lethal Interjection, bitch.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
RILEY: Oh, my pancreas hurts.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah, man, all the paper is in
reality shows, right now, nigga.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
I am forced to remain here and
express my extreme displeasure

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Let them bask in the moment.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
We beat those yellow
motherfuckers.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
The music industry's dead.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
while in no way threatening

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I'm trying to get
that Flava Flav money.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
That's who
I'm looking at right now.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Mission accomplished.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
the life of the president
and his beautiful monkey family.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
RILEY: So here I am.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Wow, that sound like
a real good plan, Thugnificent.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah, we ain't go out
like no bitches.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Back to being a nobody.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
NARRATOR: I ask Huey Freeman

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
A loser.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
The thing people ask me most

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Hey, your Granddaddy home?
Hey! Wake up, old nigga!

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Even though the people of Tibet
are still not free,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
if he has any final thoughts

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
is would I do it again?

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
he'd like to share.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Wanted to let you know until
we get this reality show money,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Hey, you kids still selling

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
as symbolic victories go,
this ain't bad.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
your boy Thugnificent
is gonna be right here

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
those chocolate bars
for charity?

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah. I'm retired.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
RILEY:
I think Ms. Von Hausen

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
might be dead.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
handling all your overnight
shipping needs, you smell me?

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
So ask yourself, what can all
this Thugnificence do for you?

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
GRANDDAD:
Whoo! Let's go home

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
and order some Chinese.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
GRANDDAD:
Unless you're not in the mood

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
for Chinese.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Nigga, will you shut
the hell up?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Some of us pay our taxes,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Mr. Punkassnificent!
