WEBVTT

00:01.134 --> 00:03.659
In an hour from now
there's gonna be an earthquake.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.637
Previously on Eli Stone:

00:05.705 --> 00:07.639
Oh, my God.

00:07.707 --> 00:10.471
I see things now,
things that were always there

00:10.543 --> 00:12.773
but that I just never noticed before.

00:12.846 --> 00:16.805
But your dad told me that I would
make good on my debt to him one day.

00:16.883 --> 00:18.646
I didn't know what your dad meant.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.686
Patients should get
their affairs in order.

00:20.754 --> 00:21.880
I should draft a will?

00:21.955 --> 00:23.820
Before I go in for my surgery...

00:23.890 --> 00:25.790
You want us to witness
your suicide note?

00:25.859 --> 00:30.523
It's a statement about how and under
what circumstances I don't want to live.

00:31.164 --> 00:34.930
- CVP holding.
- BP, 100l70.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.664
- Two liters, standing by.
- That's good.

00:38.772 --> 00:42.538
The graft is secure.
I'm preparing to tie off the aneurysm.

00:42.642 --> 00:45.805
Oxygen set is good,
respiration is normal.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.507
- Pulse is dropping!
- Damn it! It ruptured.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.048
- Hemorrhaging!
- He's in V-fib.

00:50.116 --> 00:52.141
- Re-clip proximally.
- Pressure's dropping.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.243
- Run in more volume.
- More suction.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.582
BP's dropping!

01:11.471 --> 01:12.938
Oh.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.770
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:19.446 --> 01:23.280
So you've got that...
thing this week, right?

01:23.349 --> 01:26.113
If by "thing,"
you mean getting my skull sawed open,

01:26.186 --> 01:27.710
then yeah, that's Friday.

01:30.423 --> 01:33.324
Well, listen,
if, uh, anyone deserves to...

01:35.028 --> 01:36.586
...not die,

01:36.696 --> 01:40.063
or be brain damaged...

01:40.166 --> 01:41.724
...it's you.

01:43.870 --> 01:47.601
And, look on the bright side,
if you do end up a vegetable, two words.

01:47.674 --> 01:50.575
Sponge... bath.

01:52.479 --> 01:55.312
Thanks. That's comforting.

02:03.323 --> 02:06.087
Keith, we need to talk about
the Allen depos, right?

02:06.159 --> 02:09.526
- Actually, I was looking for Eli.
- Great, I'll be in my office.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.154
Everything OK with Mosley?

02:11.264 --> 02:13.198
Aside from still being in prison?

02:13.266 --> 02:16.429
He's good. But I wanted
to talk to you about something else.

02:16.503 --> 02:20.166
- I thought they fixed that already.
- I know this is a big week for you.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.539
Is there anyone who doesn't
want to talk about neurosurgery?

02:23.610 --> 02:26.636
Look, I appreciate your concern,
but I'm gonna be fine.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.977
Did they have
an aftershock or something?

02:29.048 --> 02:31.516
OK, I get it.
You don't want to talk about it.

02:31.584 --> 02:35.076
If you change your mind, or you just
want to go out and get hammered,

02:35.155 --> 02:38.090
- drinks are on me.
- Thanks.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.058
Take care of yourself, man.

02:45.331 --> 02:49.028
Any idea why people in the office are
treating me like I'm made of glass?

02:49.102 --> 02:52.663
Um, I couldn't say.
You should get ready for your 10:00.

02:52.739 --> 02:55.606
You don't have to threaten people
to be nice to me.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.802
Well, what else
do you want me to do, Eli?

02:57.877 --> 03:00.505
People don't get brain surgery
every day.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.070
Treat me like you always do.

03:02.148 --> 03:04.981
In fact, I demand
that you are meaner to me than usual.

03:05.051 --> 03:07.485
Where is the mayor of Sass Town
when I need her?

03:07.554 --> 03:09.715
Can we just act like
everything's normal?

03:11.157 --> 03:14.615
- Your 10.00 is here.
- I didn't realize I had a 10.00.

03:14.694 --> 03:18.152
- That's because you don't listen.
- See? See, that's the spirit.

03:18.231 --> 03:20.597
Sorry. Hi. Are you Patti?

03:20.667 --> 03:23.534
So nice to meet you in person,
Mr. Green. Meet Eli Stone.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.730
- He's been expecting you.
- Yes, I have.

03:25.805 --> 03:28.365
Could you just remind me
what this is about?

03:28.441 --> 03:30.534
I need you to help me die.

03:32.745 --> 03:35.612
Assisted suicide
is illegal in California.

03:35.682 --> 03:39.812
I'm not interested in suicide,
Mr. Stone, assisted or otherwise.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.049
My wife wants me declared incompetent.

03:43.156 --> 03:48.856
She wants to take away my right
to make my own medical decisions.

03:48.928 --> 03:50.691
So... are you ill?

03:50.797 --> 03:54.255
Cancer. It started in my colon,
but it spread.

03:54.334 --> 03:57.360
I've been through chemotherapy twice.

03:57.437 --> 04:02.374
Both times I went into remission,
and both times the cancer came back.

04:02.442 --> 04:06.811
My wife wants me to have chemo again...

04:08.147 --> 04:09.580
...but I won't do it.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.384
- You don't want to go through it again.
- No.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.253
God told me to be at peace.

04:18.324 --> 04:21.781
And, in my experience,
chemotherapy is not peace.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.587
- You spoke to God?
- Yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.490
Well, he spoke to me.

04:29.135 --> 04:34.266
I prayed and I told him what happened,
and it just came to me.

04:34.340 --> 04:38.470
Not a voice, exactly, but a feeling.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.878
When it comes to chemotherapy,
for me, it told me,

04:42.982 --> 04:48.352
He... She told me,
"Third time's not the charm. "

04:50.823 --> 04:53.189
Obviously, um, I'm not a doctor,

04:53.259 --> 04:56.888
so I'm guessing...
without the chemotherapy...

04:56.963 --> 05:00.126
I'll die. Probably. Or maybe not.

05:01.934 --> 05:07.702
I... I... I just prayed and God told me
to put myself in his hands.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.770
And my wife doesn't want me to.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.942
Will you help me stop her?

05:19.752 --> 05:22.277
Have you completely
lost your mind?

05:22.355 --> 05:24.619
Original. I haven't heard that once.

05:24.691 --> 05:27.524
Sorry, but sane people
don't predict earthquakes.

05:27.593 --> 05:30.824
They don't sign DNRs
right before high-risk neurosurgery.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.764
- Why not?
- Outcomes can be unpredictable.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.098
For someone like you,
35, young, in good shape,

05:37.170 --> 05:40.662
you can come out with a horrible
prognosis and then be totally fine.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.800
Even if I come out a vegetable,
I might not stay a vegetable?

05:43.876 --> 05:46.344
Yeah, if you want
to get technical about it.

05:46.412 --> 05:50.508
Or I could stay a vegetable,
or in a coma. That's why I need a DNR.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.643
Because surgery is risky,
doesn't mean you should put your life

05:53.720 --> 05:56.883
- in some random doctor's hands.
- I'm not. I'm putting it in yours.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.616
You want me to be your healthcare proxy?

05:59.692 --> 06:02.661
- Back to the crazy jokes?
- You've lost your mind for real.

06:02.729 --> 06:05.095
What is so insane
about asking my brother,

06:05.198 --> 06:08.326
who also happens to be a doctor,
to be my healthcare proxy?

06:08.401 --> 06:11.962
Except the last two people your brother
did that for happened to die.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.872
Valerie Masters refused a heart. You
said so yourself. She made a decision.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.502
Yeah, but Dad didn't.
Look, I know my limits.

06:18.611 --> 06:21.546
Ten years ago I made a bad decision.
I'm not doing it again.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.081
- You won't.
- You don't know!

06:23.149 --> 06:25.413
Yes, I do!
You've been right about everything,

06:25.485 --> 06:27.715
the aneurysm, Dr. Rajapaksa.

06:27.787 --> 06:31.086
- Whatever happens, I trust you.
- And if I don't trust myself?

06:31.157 --> 06:34.058
That's the beauty of it.
You don't have to.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.858
What matters most is that
I believe you'll do the right thing.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.398
And by "right thing,"
you mean, if things get bad,

06:42.468 --> 06:44.834
if worse comes to worst,
you want me to...

06:44.904 --> 06:46.804
I want you to let me go.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.770
Dr. Stone?
Dr. Rajapaksa wants to see you.

06:51.844 --> 06:53.971
It's about your brother.

07:13.933 --> 07:18.199
So I heard about your case.
And, well, I was thinking,

07:18.271 --> 07:20.831
my schedule's pretty free,
I could second chair.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.875
Uh, that's OK.
I can handle it alone.

07:22.975 --> 07:26.103
Well, no, of course you can.
I wasn't implying that...

07:26.179 --> 07:28.545
Do you even know what the case is about?

07:28.648 --> 07:30.616
- Not really.
- No, I had a feeling.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.877
So, what're you really doing here?

07:34.287 --> 07:37.745
Nothing. Nothing at all.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.382
It's just, I owe you.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.828
For last week, for saving Scott,
for everything.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.660
Get in on the dying guy case
with the other dying guy

07:46.732 --> 07:49.166
before both guys get
flushed down the toilet.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.601
Yes. No. Wait, what?

07:51.671 --> 07:54.970
- You're afraid I'm gonna die.
- No, I'm not.

07:55.741 --> 07:59.700
I'm not! In fact, I would really,
really prefer it if you didn't.

08:00.813 --> 08:05.716
It's just, this operation,
it's dangerous.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.151
Really dangerous.

08:09.021 --> 08:12.787
So maybe I am a little scared.
I mean, aren't you?

08:14.727 --> 08:19.494
Truthfully, living or dying,
either of those is fine with me.

08:19.599 --> 08:23.126
It's the something in between
that scares me.

08:24.203 --> 08:28.697
But, for the record,
dying is not really on my agenda, so...

08:29.976 --> 08:33.639
OK. You can second chair.
But no sniffling.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.476
OK. Thanks.

08:35.548 --> 08:38.039
No one wants to die.
But I'm going to, Rebecca.

08:38.116 --> 08:42.053
I just choose to die on my own terms.

08:42.121 --> 08:45.215
But we choose life, David.
That's what we do.

08:45.291 --> 08:48.920
Moses' last words to the Israelites.
"Choose life. "

08:48.995 --> 08:53.329
She called it "the 11th Commandment"
in one of her sermons.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.530
My wife's a rabbi.
Did I forget to mention that?

08:57.637 --> 08:59.662
Yes, actually, you did.

08:59.739 --> 09:02.003
But that explains
the talking to God part.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.975
But Jews haven't talked to God
since the biblical age.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.810
In any case, you'd have to first
believe that God exists. David doesn't.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.884
- That's not true.
- Fine. He doesn't believe God exists,

09:11.984 --> 09:13.713
except during baseball season.

09:13.786 --> 09:17.950
As it turns out,
I was diagnosed during baseball season.

09:18.024 --> 09:21.926
I'm hardly the first person
to find faith in times of crisis.

09:21.994 --> 09:24.724
That's a large part
of what faith is for, isn't it?

09:24.797 --> 09:26.856
We're not questioning
your belief in God,

09:26.933 --> 09:28.833
just your belief that God spoke to you.

09:28.901 --> 09:31.426
I prayed, and I got answers.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.564
How does that make me
less competent than other people?

09:34.640 --> 09:38.371
Because the answers you got
advised you to abandon your children.

09:38.444 --> 09:41.208
They advised me to die with dignity.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.872
And, if that's God's plan,

09:42.982 --> 09:48.010
I can't imagine a greater lesson
to teach my children.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.181
They don't need lessons.
They need their father.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.418
As long as possible.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.692
Where have you been?
I've been calling and calling.

09:58.764 --> 09:59.856
Something happened?

09:59.932 --> 10:04.096
Nothing makes me crazier than you not
answering your cell phone when I call.

10:04.170 --> 10:07.105
- I know you were in the car.
- I must have had it on vibrate.

10:07.173 --> 10:11.405
How hard is it to turn your ringer on?
Do I have to follow you, telling you,

10:11.477 --> 10:14.605
"Ring, ring. Somebody's calling,"
when the person calling is me?

10:14.680 --> 10:17.205
Wow. OK, I'll turn my ringer on.

10:17.283 --> 10:21.515
Good. And... your mama
dresses you funny.

10:22.655 --> 10:25.624
Oh, the mean thing.
I'd forgotten how good you are at that.

10:25.691 --> 10:29.058
Jordan wants to see you,
probably some stupid thing you did.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.359
Now get out of here.
I can't stand looking in your face.

10:32.431 --> 10:35.059
- Thanks, Patti.
- Well, don't just stand there.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.900
- There he is. Go! Go!
- Eli. Walk with me.

10:39.005 --> 10:42.270
Um, I know I said I wouldn't take
any new cases before Friday...

10:42.341 --> 10:46.437
It's not about the case. As WPK's
former and current managing partner...

10:46.512 --> 10:49.174
I know I congratulated you
a couple of days ago.

10:49.248 --> 10:52.342
But I'm having this weird
déjà vu-y kind of day.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.319
So, in case I didn't,
congratulations again.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.616
May I continue?

10:56.689 --> 11:00.557
When you walked into my office
eight years ago, you know what I saw?

11:00.626 --> 11:03.151
A strapping young lawyer
with a full head of hair?

11:03.229 --> 11:06.721
Hmm. A greedy, self-righteous,
little sycophant.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.364
- An ass.
- I am flattered, sir.

11:10.469 --> 11:14.565
But, as I got to know you, I saw you
were more. You were driven, competitive.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.905
When I found out you
were going to be my son-in-law,

11:17.977 --> 11:19.672
I couldn't have been happier.

11:19.745 --> 11:22.373
You were the man
to follow in my footsteps,

11:22.448 --> 11:26.578
to take WPK to the prestigious heights
I had dreamed of.

11:26.652 --> 11:31.146
I put you on the fast track for partner.
But then you got an aneurysm.

11:31.223 --> 11:33.453
And I changed. I know.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.690
Is this little walk-and-talk
about how much I've disappointed you?

11:38.731 --> 11:42.167
Sometimes, you are still an ass.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.116
What's going on?

12:01.187 --> 12:05.283
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you the junior partner

12:05.357 --> 12:09.316
in charge of pro bono initiatives,
Mr. Eli Stone.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.360
Me? What? Oh, my God.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.832
Kudos, man. You deserve this.

12:20.439 --> 12:24.535
Eli. We're so proud of you.
You mean so much to everyone here.

12:25.845 --> 12:29.975
Couldn't have happened to a better guy.
Except me, of course.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.249
Eli, I am so happy for you.

12:39.692 --> 12:43.253
Wait. I know what's going on here.

12:43.329 --> 12:48.164
Sir, um, being partner means more to me
than you'll ever know.

12:48.234 --> 12:52.398
But if you're doing this
because you think I'm gonna die

12:52.505 --> 12:55.770
- or as an incentive to live...
- Eli, you have it all wrong.

12:57.176 --> 13:01.112
I made you partner
because your compassion changed me.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.485
Please wake up.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.262
How would you describe
David's religious beliefs?

13:19.865 --> 13:24.234
David was born Jewish,
but he never had any faith to speak of.

13:24.336 --> 13:27.828
He always said if I hadn't been
so pretty, he would've married a shiksa.

13:27.907 --> 13:31.274
So when David said
that God had spoken to him...

13:31.343 --> 13:33.174
At first I thought it was a joke.

13:33.245 --> 13:36.578
Now, I'm convinced
it's just a symptom of his depression.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.616
Depression?

13:37.716 --> 13:41.049
When the colon cancer progressed,
when David didn't respond

13:41.120 --> 13:43.020
to the new chemotherapy, he...

13:43.989 --> 13:47.117
He grew more and more
despondent. Hopeless.

13:47.193 --> 13:50.924
He claims to have found
new faith and hope.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.260
If that was the case,
he wouldn't be giving up.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.961
He'd fight to live,
to see our children grow up.

13:57.036 --> 14:01.973
For as long as he can.
That's what God wants.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.009
Thank you.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.845
The God that you believe in.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.682
The God of the Jewish faith.

14:12.785 --> 14:17.279
Judaism teaches that God instilled in us
the gift of learning.

14:17.356 --> 14:22.225
Human beings have learned to expand
the horizons of science and medicine,

14:22.294 --> 14:26.458
to create treatments,
however brutal or dangerous,

14:26.565 --> 14:30.695
which can fight disease,
which can save our lives.

14:30.769 --> 14:33.636
That's why I believe
God wants David to live

14:33.706 --> 14:36.937
because he created a world
in which there is a chance

14:37.009 --> 14:38.909
for my husband to survive.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.105
I just want him to take that chance.

14:42.181 --> 14:46.311
For me, and for his children,

14:46.385 --> 14:48.353
and for himself.

14:49.755 --> 14:53.316
That's why I married her.
She's great under pressure, isn't she?

14:56.528 --> 14:58.621
She's very convincing.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.193
Are you having second thoughts
about helping me?

15:05.371 --> 15:09.273
What exactly did God say to you?
How did it happen?

15:09.341 --> 15:14.244
Did you see someone or hear a song?

15:15.948 --> 15:18.917
I can't explain.
It's not like I heard a voice, exactly.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.952
It's more like a...

15:21.487 --> 15:26.550
A moment of clarity.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.752
And I felt calm.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.464
I had peace.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.798
That never happened to me.

15:36.869 --> 15:40.737
You know, it's never happened
to Rebecca, and she's a rabbi.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.805
Want your office back?

15:45.878 --> 15:50.042
A partner should have a big
private office that isn't a library.

15:50.149 --> 15:54.176
Hmm. Who knew that imminent death
could be so upwardly mobile?

15:56.622 --> 15:59.591
You know I couldn't
be more proud of you, right?

15:59.658 --> 16:01.421
Well, that means a lot.

16:02.428 --> 16:05.556
Especially because
you're one of the people I trampled on,

16:05.631 --> 16:08.998
on my ruthless climb to the top.

16:11.437 --> 16:14.065
I've been wanting to tell you something.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.267
I suppose now is as good a time as any.

16:18.877 --> 16:21.812
You're the most important person
in my life.

16:21.880 --> 16:25.247
I thought it was Carlo,
the guy that colors your hair.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.615
I'm serious, Eli.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.695
You taught me about love.

16:37.997 --> 16:43.958
And not just the romantic kind,
but the all-encompassing, lifetime kind.

16:45.471 --> 16:49.931
The kind that sustains
through tragedy and triumph.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.470
- Through breakups...
- Brain surgery?

16:55.781 --> 17:01.117
Taylor, I'm going
to do my darnedest not to die.

17:01.186 --> 17:05.885
Listen to me.
You are not dead, all right?

17:09.261 --> 17:11.627
You're not dead.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.098
Listen to me.

17:21.073 --> 17:24.736
I said I'd be there for you,
no matter what, Eli, and I meant it.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.944
Taylor?

17:31.550 --> 17:33.177
- Hey.
- It's good to see you.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.743
You too.

17:36.822 --> 17:40.588
- You hanging in there?
- Me? Yeah, I'm...

17:40.692 --> 17:42.250
I'm fine.

17:47.599 --> 17:52.161
They were almost done with the surgery,
just about to clip the aneurysm.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.502
Thought he was out of the woods,
then there was a hemorrhage.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.735
Then another.

17:57.843 --> 18:00.937
Artery walls were weakened
due to pressure from the aneurysm,

18:01.013 --> 18:03.345
and the surgery just made things worse.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.208
Eli went into cardiac arrest,

18:06.285 --> 18:09.914
and the heart attack
cut off blood flow to his brain.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.623
- And the aneurysm?
- It's gone.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.495
But...

18:22.634 --> 18:27.264
You know, in an alternate universe,
Eli and I would be married now, and...

18:28.307 --> 18:31.470
...I'd be the one having
to make the decision to...

18:33.178 --> 18:35.738
- The decision.
- Eli already made his decision.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.975
He didn't want to live this way.

18:38.650 --> 18:41.483
Nate, it's easy to say that
when it's a hypothetical.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.919
But when the worst actually happens...

18:45.090 --> 18:48.457
Just because Eli asked you
to let him go...

18:49.461 --> 18:51.929
It doesn't mean
you have to honor his request.

18:51.997 --> 18:56.764
No, but I have to honor him.

18:58.103 --> 19:01.197
I've already let him down,
and I can't do it again. I just...

19:04.576 --> 19:06.009
I can't.

19:10.315 --> 19:14.479
Everything's going my way.
I made partner. Junior partner.

19:14.586 --> 19:17.555
- They had a cake for me. Red velvet.
- Congratulations.

19:17.623 --> 19:23.186
It's what I've been working toward for
years, and now I have it. I earned it.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.757
It's just...

19:25.831 --> 19:29.597
"For what shall it profit a man
if he shall regain the corner office

19:29.668 --> 19:31.932
and lose his own soul?"

19:32.004 --> 19:34.632
Mark 8:36, from your new favorite book.

19:34.706 --> 19:38.665
I have a new client.
He's dying of cancer.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.878
- He says that God spoke to him.
- Did he use a musical number?

19:42.981 --> 19:46.644
No. He just took away his burdens.

19:48.153 --> 19:51.054
He feels like this great weight
has been lifted from him.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.450
- Makes me think.
- "What's God done for you lately?"

19:55.527 --> 19:57.995
Well, yeah.
This guy, he grants inner peace,

19:58.063 --> 20:00.429
and me he just tries
to scare the crap out of.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.695
Maybe God's showing his love
by scaring the crap out of you.

20:03.769 --> 20:07.432
So this is spiritual
corporal punishment?

20:11.176 --> 20:13.076
Why are you looking at me like that?

20:15.647 --> 20:16.875
Back on the commune,

20:16.949 --> 20:21.477
which is supposed to be a place
of harmony and connection to nature,

20:21.553 --> 20:23.521
I never felt close to God.

20:24.189 --> 20:25.622
So when I went out on my own,

20:25.691 --> 20:28.854
I immersed myself in the study
of religion, all religions,

20:28.927 --> 20:31.487
so that I could find Him.

20:32.331 --> 20:35.596
Funny thing is,
all those years of seeking Him out,

20:35.667 --> 20:37.225
He goes and finds me,

20:37.302 --> 20:40.237
when he sent a smug, stubborn,
pain-in-the-rear lawyer

20:40.305 --> 20:42.170
right up to my door.

20:46.111 --> 20:48.944
You've lifted my burdens, Eli.

20:49.014 --> 20:52.643
You're doing it too! Why is everyone
talking to me like I'm gonna...

21:05.230 --> 21:07.721
- Nathan?
- Can I help you?

21:07.799 --> 21:11.565
Actually, I'm here
to help you... help Eli.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.410
Maybe you could say that again.

21:19.478 --> 21:22.641
I had a dream about Eli.
Part of him is alive.

21:22.748 --> 21:25.581
He's in there, and I think
he's trying to get a message out.

21:25.651 --> 21:27.744
A message?

21:27.819 --> 21:31.380
Through a dream...
... to his acupuncturist?

21:31.456 --> 21:35.586
To his friend. To someone who
might be more open to these messages.

21:35.661 --> 21:37.788
If it happened to you,
you'd think it was just a dream.

21:37.863 --> 21:41.526
Well, it happened to you,
and I still think it. No offense.

21:43.368 --> 21:47.634
He doesn't know the surgery happened
yet, Dr. Stone, but he's close.

21:50.876 --> 21:54.812
Two weeks ago I would've called you
a quack and sent you on your way. Now...

21:54.880 --> 21:56.745
Eli told you things.

21:56.815 --> 22:00.251
Things about your past
that he had no way of knowing.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.413
And then he put me in charge of his DNR.

22:03.488 --> 22:06.184
Even comatose, he's a tool.

22:10.228 --> 22:12.992
Today I'm supposed
to take him off of life support.

22:13.098 --> 22:15.658
I think I'm supposed
to convince you otherwise.

22:15.767 --> 22:20.500
I want to listen.
I want to believe you.

22:21.239 --> 22:24.902
More than anything, I want to believe
that, if I just wait long enough,

22:24.976 --> 22:27.536
- Eli will wake up.
- Then why don't you?

22:27.612 --> 22:29.876
Because I can't.

22:29.948 --> 22:34.510
Because I know he's not OK,
and he's not going to get better.

22:34.586 --> 22:36.486
Medical science isn't everything.

22:36.555 --> 22:39.786
If you've listened to anything
Eli had to say, you'd know that.

22:39.858 --> 22:43.555
It's not about what I know.
It's about what Eli wants.

22:43.628 --> 22:45.789
And he was very, very specific.

22:45.897 --> 22:49.560
And if I substitute my needs for his,
then I'm...

22:52.170 --> 22:54.536
It's like I'm betraying him.

23:02.581 --> 23:05.345
We're not betraying him, Nate.

23:06.818 --> 23:11.187
- This is my dad.
- With me. I worked for him.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.154
There's no chance
you Photoshopped this?

23:14.226 --> 23:16.194
I can barely check my e-mail.

23:22.634 --> 23:27.196
Nate, years ago,
your father foresaw me helping Eli.

23:27.272 --> 23:29.934
And, finally, I think
this is my chance to.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.275
Give him more time.

23:36.181 --> 23:39.742
I'll wait 48 hours.

23:39.818 --> 23:42.787
- But if Eli doesn't wake up...
- He will.

23:47.392 --> 23:50.486
Then I'll do my best
to believe in that too.

23:51.129 --> 23:52.426
Be at peace.

23:53.498 --> 23:56.865
That was God's message to you?
That's so simple.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.062
I guess that's why it's divine.

24:00.272 --> 24:05.005
So chemo could extend your life,
or even save it.

24:06.511 --> 24:08.172
Why wouldn't you want that?

24:08.246 --> 24:10.305
Is your wife right?
Are you depressed?

24:10.382 --> 24:12.009
No.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.852
In fact, in some ways,
I'm happier than I've ever been.

24:15.921 --> 24:20.585
This is how I want to spend my remaining
days, and isn't it my choice to make?

24:20.659 --> 24:22.217
Thank you, David.

24:22.828 --> 24:25.763
What did God sound like, Mr. Green?

24:26.531 --> 24:28.658
Well, I didn't hear a voice.

24:28.733 --> 24:33.102
Well, if you didn't hear a voice,
how can you be so sure it was God?

24:33.205 --> 24:38.438
A feeling came over me. And I can't
describe that feeling, that serenity

24:38.510 --> 24:40.808
as anything other than divine.

24:42.581 --> 24:47.678
- And before that, you were despondent.
- Yeah.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.847
What about the first time
the chemo worked?

24:51.923 --> 24:54.687
Elated. Why? What's your point?

24:54.759 --> 24:57.284
One minute you're up,
the next you're down.

24:57.362 --> 24:58.989
There a question in our future?

24:59.064 --> 25:03.160
I'm just wondering if this serenity
isn't just the latest peak on the ride.

25:03.235 --> 25:06.398
That your overloaded brain
created a moment of clarity

25:06.471 --> 25:08.405
so that you'd just let go?

25:08.473 --> 25:11.442
Against scientific evidence
that chemotherapy, sir,

25:11.510 --> 25:13.671
can, in fact, save your life.

25:13.745 --> 25:17.374
You know there's a scientific
explanation for the burning bush?

25:17.449 --> 25:20.748
Dry local fauna
under a volcanic fissure.

25:20.819 --> 25:23.379
But none of us were there, Rebecca.
None of us know.

25:23.488 --> 25:25.456
How can you know it wasn't divine?

25:25.524 --> 25:31.485
Let me enjoy my last moments
on this earth with you and the children.

25:32.597 --> 25:34.121
I'm going to lose.

25:34.199 --> 25:37.862
Mrs. Green, um,
you really shouldn't be here.

25:37.936 --> 25:41.064
I could get sanctioned
for talking to you ex parte.

25:41.139 --> 25:45.235
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
Rabbi's honor.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.978
I know I can't convince a judge

25:50.048 --> 25:52.915
to substitute David's judgment
for my judgment.

25:52.984 --> 25:55.919
Then why put David through this?

25:55.987 --> 25:58.683
Because I do think
I need to convince David.

25:58.757 --> 26:03.490
I need to convince him to keep fighting.
And I need your help.

26:03.562 --> 26:07.123
Rabbi, he's made his decision.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.496
I know you, Mr. Stone.

26:12.237 --> 26:15.138
I know all about you.

26:15.206 --> 26:17.470
- What do you know?
- You're sick.

26:17.542 --> 26:21.706
You're fighting for your life, just as
my husband should be fighting for his.

26:22.914 --> 26:26.077
I know about the earthquake.

26:26.151 --> 26:27.812
I know about all of it.

26:27.886 --> 26:33.347
Mostly, I know
you are more than just a lawyer.

26:33.425 --> 26:37.691
And I know David chose you for a reason.

26:37.762 --> 26:40.230
And I believe that reason
is for you to show him

26:40.298 --> 26:45.930
that difficulties can be overcome,
that fighting for your life is worth it.

26:46.838 --> 26:50.501
Jewish tradition teaches
that to save one life...

26:51.776 --> 26:54.472
...is to save the entire world.

26:54.546 --> 26:57.515
You have within you
the power to save a life.

26:57.616 --> 27:01.518
I beg of you... use it.

27:08.893 --> 27:12.852
I think we can win this case.
I think I can get the judge

27:12.931 --> 27:16.264
to stop Rebecca
from forcing you to take the chemo.

27:16.334 --> 27:19.963
Well, that's great news.
But, apparently, not to you.

27:20.038 --> 27:21.767
Rebecca came to see me.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.012
I thought that was against the rules.

27:30.348 --> 27:31.906
She's a rabbi.

27:32.550 --> 27:36.111
We talked, and the thing is, David,

27:36.187 --> 27:39.418
I... I think she's right.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.755
I think you should want to live.

27:42.861 --> 27:48.163
Not just for her or for the kids,
but for yourself.

27:48.233 --> 27:50.667
Aren't you supposed
to be on my side, Eli?

27:51.369 --> 27:55.135
Rebecca, the doctors,
and now you're trying to convince me...

27:55.206 --> 27:58.573
I'm not like them. I'm more like you.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.803
I...

28:00.512 --> 28:02.639
I believe that God spoke to you.

28:04.549 --> 28:06.642
I just think you heard him wrong.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.955
He sent you a doctor.
He sent you a rabbi.

28:12.323 --> 28:14.052
And now he's sent me.

28:14.125 --> 28:17.219
A doctor, rabbi, lawyer...
Sounds like the start of a joke.

28:17.295 --> 28:20.264
I think that God wants you
to fight for your life.

28:22.467 --> 28:23.729
I am.

28:25.370 --> 28:30.103
I'm fighting for the life I have now.

28:32.310 --> 28:36.770
You know, you never asked me
what my life was like before cancer.

28:37.582 --> 28:39.948
Well, I had everything.

28:40.018 --> 28:43.749
I had a great job, I had a great car.

28:43.822 --> 28:47.588
I drove home every night to a
great house with a great wife and kids.

28:47.659 --> 28:51.220
Except I never saw my family.
I was always at work.

28:51.329 --> 28:54.787
You know why I never went
to Rebecca's services at the synagogue?

28:54.866 --> 28:57.391
Because I got home so late
every Friday night

28:57.469 --> 29:01.200
that Saturday mornings,
I was too exhausted to get out of bed.

29:02.440 --> 29:06.900
Was I a skeptic? Yeah.
But who could blame me?

29:08.346 --> 29:11.315
- That life had no meaning.
- It sounds familiar.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.442
I was sleepwalking.
Don't you see, Eli,

29:14.519 --> 29:17.283
that if I never got sick...

29:19.324 --> 29:21.292
...I'd still be asleep.

29:23.962 --> 29:26.192
And I'm awake now.

29:28.633 --> 29:30.931
I have a full life now.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.233
And it's a life
I never thought I'd have.

29:36.875 --> 29:41.778
And I owe it to that moment with God.

29:43.148 --> 29:45.446
I have a purpose now.

29:47.252 --> 29:49.914
That's what I'm fighting for.

29:50.688 --> 29:53.384
This case is not about God.

29:54.025 --> 29:58.291
The mere fact that David Green
has embraced death to such an extreme,

29:58.363 --> 30:00.923
over the pleas of his wife and children,

30:01.032 --> 30:05.162
is evidence itself that he is not
competent to make this decision.

30:05.236 --> 30:08.399
Rabbi Green, her children
and his doctors

30:08.473 --> 30:11.931
have been unable to force this man
to do the right thing.

30:12.010 --> 30:15.537
But this court can, and it should.

30:24.088 --> 30:28.548
Rabbi Green thinks that there is
no way David could have spoken to God.

30:30.562 --> 30:33.053
Well, there's no way
to prove that he did.

30:34.766 --> 30:38.099
But there's no way
to prove he didn't, either.

30:38.703 --> 30:42.764
Counsel asked David to tell us
what God sounded like.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.810
Why? I think, if we have faith,

30:45.877 --> 30:50.246
we believe that God speaks to us each
in different ways.

30:52.684 --> 30:56.552
A few months ago,
I started hearing and seeing things

30:56.621 --> 30:59.988
that indicated the presence
of God in my life.

31:00.058 --> 31:03.755
I tried to follow
what I thought God wanted.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.388
And I paid the price.

31:07.632 --> 31:12.001
Looking back, I think
it's been the best time of my life.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.708
David had a feeling.

31:18.409 --> 31:23.312
I saw George Michael. Is that crazy?

31:23.381 --> 31:26.475
If it inspires us
to change our lives for the better,

31:26.551 --> 31:32.012
then I hope, I pray... we're all crazy.

31:32.991 --> 31:37.655
David wants to live the rest of his life
in a way that brings him closer to God,

31:37.729 --> 31:41.790
and it may not be
what we would choose for him.

31:41.866 --> 31:46.303
But it's not our choice to make.
It's his.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.904
Taylor.

31:49.974 --> 31:51.305
Dad. Hi.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.976
- We should get going.
- Yeah. Yes.

31:55.046 --> 31:57.412
Just give me a sec, OK?

31:58.750 --> 32:01.048
- You're crying.
- Yeah.

32:01.819 --> 32:05.653
- I'm sorry. I know you hate crying.
- Honey, I don't hate crying.

32:06.824 --> 32:08.189
OK, I hate it.

32:08.259 --> 32:12.218
But these are difficult...
more than difficult times.

32:12.330 --> 32:13.888
I understand.

32:16.467 --> 32:20.563
Not exactly how I thought it would go
when I started working here.

32:29.747 --> 32:31.772
- Do you regret it? Working here?
- No.

32:32.717 --> 32:33.809
No.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.045
It hasn't been easy.

32:39.824 --> 32:43.590
For what it's worth,
I realize a lot of that's been my fault.

32:46.331 --> 32:49.300
I take it from your silence,
you agree with me.

32:49.367 --> 32:54.100
It's OK, Dad, you were just being you.
Mr. Difficult.

32:55.306 --> 33:00.334
I want you to know,
I'm trying to not be myself anymore.

33:01.079 --> 33:02.341
If Eli was...

33:05.149 --> 33:10.485
If Eli was here,
I was gonna make him a partner.

33:10.555 --> 33:13.285
I'm starting a pro bono practice.

33:14.058 --> 33:17.084
I'm changing. The firm is changing.

33:17.161 --> 33:20.255
I want you to be
an integral part of that.

33:20.331 --> 33:23.425
Please, honey, stick with me.

33:23.501 --> 33:26.402
I need you here.

33:28.873 --> 33:31.205
How could I not?

33:31.275 --> 33:33.539
In ruling
on Mr. Green's competence,

33:33.611 --> 33:35.772
I am not unaware
that a verdict in his favor

33:35.847 --> 33:38.509
may well sign his death certificate.

33:38.583 --> 33:42.542
Mr. Dupler used Mr. Green's
alleged conversation with God

33:42.620 --> 33:45.487
as evidence that
he is mentally unstable.

33:45.556 --> 33:51.085
Mr. Stone warned us against
calling faith a form of insanity.

33:51.162 --> 33:55.292
But in the eyes of the law, Mr. Green's
faith is irrelevant to this case.

33:56.167 --> 34:00.194
I must consider his decision
to not pursue a course of treatment

34:00.271 --> 34:02.762
that will make him temporarily sicker,

34:02.840 --> 34:06.105
but which will not guarantee him
a permanent cure.

34:06.177 --> 34:10.079
From that perspective, Mr. Green's
decision is perfectly rational.

34:10.148 --> 34:14.585
The law respects
a dying man's wishes to keep on living,

34:14.652 --> 34:18.610
by whatever definition
of "living" he chooses.

34:18.723 --> 34:23.284
The motion to have David Green
declared incompetent is hereby denied.

34:25.563 --> 34:29.090
- Congratulations.
- Thank you for giving me my life back.

34:41.312 --> 34:43.610
- Get the crash cart.
- No. It's all right.

34:44.482 --> 34:46.313
This is what he wanted.

34:48.953 --> 34:50.681
Goodbye, my love.

36:16.641 --> 36:18.871
Something's not right.

36:18.943 --> 36:20.501
I...

36:20.611 --> 36:24.707
I've been wearing the same suit
and the same shirt and tie for days.

36:24.782 --> 36:29.151
I don't ever remember going home. Or how
I've been getting from place to place.

36:29.220 --> 36:32.314
It's like I'm somewhere,
and then I'm someplace else.

36:33.224 --> 36:34.782
And making partner?

36:34.892 --> 36:38.225
And the case
being about living or dying.

36:39.463 --> 36:42.125
The way everyone's treating me.

36:43.267 --> 36:47.761
- It's like...
- It's like what, Eli?

36:48.639 --> 36:53.008
I already
had the surgery, didn't I?

36:53.744 --> 36:56.907
And it went bad, like in the vision.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.278
Sorry, bro.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.147
Am I?

37:06.958 --> 37:10.519
- Did I shove off?
- Does it matter?

37:10.628 --> 37:11.754
What...

37:11.829 --> 37:14.992
What the hell kind of question is that?
I don't want to be dead.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.398
- Then don't be.
- What does that mean?

37:17.468 --> 37:19.163
It means what it means.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.899
Would you just stop
being annoying and enigmatic!

37:21.973 --> 37:25.306
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm not really here.

37:25.376 --> 37:29.938
Neither are you, for that matter.
It's kind of trippy, isn't it?

37:34.986 --> 37:36.851
You could let go.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.788
No one blames you, Eli.

37:39.857 --> 37:42.087
No one's angry.

37:43.361 --> 37:45.261
They're sad.

37:46.497 --> 37:48.328
And they'll hurt.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.934
They'll hurt for a long time.

37:52.236 --> 37:55.069
But the world
will go on without you, Eli.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.806
The world doesn't need Eli Stone.

38:00.544 --> 38:01.841
Unless...

38:03.914 --> 38:05.609
Unless?

38:07.685 --> 38:08.845
I have...

38:10.855 --> 38:14.757
You can say it, Eli. It's OK.
I'm sure it's nice for Him to hear.

38:14.825 --> 38:18.124
I have more to do?
I have more to do.

38:18.195 --> 38:20.322
I think so too.

38:23.034 --> 38:27.368
How do I get out of here?
Do I take a red pill?

38:27.438 --> 38:29.804
Or, you know,
get Scotty to beam me up?

38:31.575 --> 38:33.270
How about riding the needle?

38:34.645 --> 38:37.478
Does acupuncture work
if it's technically imaginary?

38:37.548 --> 38:41.678
Ah tch tch!
You listen to figment Dr. Chen.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.485
Yeah.

38:50.528 --> 38:51.893
Thank you.

38:52.430 --> 38:55.160
For what?
You're talking to yourself.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.464
I'll miss you most of all, Scarecrow.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.733
That was lame, dude.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.569
Hello?

39:09.980 --> 39:11.743
Is anyone there?

39:16.887 --> 39:18.047
George.

39:18.956 --> 39:20.287
Uh...

39:21.192 --> 39:22.659
What are you?

39:24.862 --> 39:28.889
Oh, man. Are you God?

39:28.966 --> 39:31.730
Well, some men have said so.

39:32.803 --> 39:34.065
Um...

39:35.673 --> 39:38.198
I don't know how to get back.

39:38.275 --> 39:40.607
Sure, you do. You've always known.

39:41.278 --> 39:42.506
I have?
