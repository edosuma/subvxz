[ Brennan ] It’s been
scientifically proven that
higher surface temperatures...

00:17.185 --> 00:19.517
contribute to
extreme weather events.

00:19.604 --> 00:22.846
Look, I don’t understand.
How does an ice storm
followed by a snow storm...

00:22.940 --> 00:24.441
qualify as global warming?

00:24.525 --> 00:26.766
No. The term
is not “global warming.”
It’s “climate change.”

If I can interrupt.
If you’re gonna
take my side.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.652
- I’m not taking sides.
- Then no.

Okay. Here are the facts, Bones.
Sometimes it’s hot,
sometimes it’s cold.

00:33.868 --> 00:36.530
Okay. Seriously, guys,
I really think that we need
to talk about your partnership.

Okay. Is that why

- Brennan.
- D.C. medical examiner
brought in remains...

of an l-295 overpass.

[Brennan ] Why didn’t they
let us inspect the crime scene?
It’s very irritating.

No way.

’Cause if they waited

I know it’s early,
but the radio says this
might turn into a blizzard.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.854
So, lwas thinking
we could work on the case
for a couple of hours...

Everything is fine.
Angela, it really is.

03:11.942 --> 03:15.309
When you find out that
you’re a carrier and you have
a child inside, it’s kind of—

03:15.404 --> 03:18.146
I know, I know.
But the doctor told us
it doesn’t mean a thing...

03:18.240 --> 03:20.105
unless I’m an L.C.A.
carrier too, right?

03:20.242 --> 03:22.278
Right.
Right. Yeah. Good.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.907
So, we wait for my results.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.953
And until then,
you gotta remember,

03:27.041 --> 03:29.953
there is a very,
very small chance
that I’m a carrier.

your mama, “Don’t worry.”

advice to give a mother, right?
Yes.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.306
But come on.
Wouldn’t you hate it
if we didn’t reassure you?

- Not necessary.

viral antibodies,
but no active virions.

Good. Good. Wait.
But how was the victim
strangled?

04:53.836 --> 04:57.294

The killer used
his hands and— Oh, no.

And, since the virus
has a 10-to-12—day
incubation period...

05:07.099 --> 05:08.760
and the murder occurred
almost two weeks ago,

05:08.893 --> 05:11.384
that means the killer is—

There have been no other
reported cases of C.C.H.F.

Only if we catch
the killer in time.

spread the disease.

in any danger of getting sick?

07:56.226 --> 07:58.012
Absolutely.

This is a map from

08:12.993 --> 08:16.736
- Okay. So not North America?
- So, you think that
the victim was a foreigner.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.946
The discriminant functions
of the cranial measurements...

08:19.041 --> 08:21.828
suggest that she was at least
part Native American.

08:21.919 --> 08:25.286
It would be extremely unusual
for someone with
North American Indian blood...

08:25.381 --> 08:26.666
to be born somewhere else.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.463
Okay. So she was a traveler.

reconstruction,

so I can’t do X-rays. Should I
go ahead and clean the bones?

No, no. Go to my office
and look through back issues

According to
Dr. Brennan’s article,

09:10.676 --> 09:14.043
you create a vacuum
inside the glove box,
then pull back the tape.

09:14.138 --> 09:17.926
And this will release
electrical currents strong
enough to generate X-rays?

Theoretically.
Straight through
to the film underneath.

I have a plan.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.289
Great. l’ll climb up
and get it open.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.295
Oh, no, no, no.
I’m the climber.
You’re the thinker.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.513
No. I’ll be able
to fit through the gap
much easier.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.963
- Here.
- Bones, just let me
do the climbing.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.639

I’ll show you.

10:42.726 --> 10:46.139
Oh, hello!
Uh, do you want to
get on my shoulders?

10:46.230 --> 10:48.892
Hey, guys. Mrs. Ross
sent some snacks.
Hello.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.815
Hello. Why is everyone
saying hello?

10:51.902 --> 10:53.358
Uh, I’m sorry.

Should I—

10:55.072 --> 10:57.108
Is this a bad—
Hello. She wants
to sit on my shoulders.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.690
Traditionally, people do that
the other way around.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.447
I’m merely demonstrating
that the widest part of me...

11:02.538 --> 11:04.199
is narrower than
the widest part of Booth.

Ah,nght

11:05.582 --> 11:07.698
Wow. Okay.

during a blizzard, right?

11:09.670 --> 11:12.127
Look, I got the idea, Bones.
Thank you.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.954
Seriously?

11:14.049 --> 11:17.257
The only records you have
of test results are on computer?

11:17.344 --> 11:20.586
I mean, didn’t somebody
jot them down somewhere?

11:20.681 --> 11:22.637
Okay, listen.
I need my test results, okay?

12:54.691 --> 12:57.023
Oh! Where’s Sweets
with those painkillers?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.146
Maybe Mrs. Ross
didn’t have any.

12:59.237 --> 13:03.606
She’s been singing
in the hallways for a week
after her dental surgery.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.201
Trust me.
She has painkillers.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.026
Victim had foreign objects...

13:08.121 --> 13:10.032
embedded in her left femur.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.786
Remodeling suggests
they’d been there
for at least four years.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.413
Ow!

13:15.504 --> 13:19.964
- Shrapnel.
- Yes, the random placement
would suggest an explosion.

13:20.050 --> 13:23.463
- How did you know that?
- Army buddy of mine spent
a few months in a hospital...

13:23.553 --> 13:26.135
after an LED. explosion.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.713
I saw his X-rays.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.845
So the victim was probably
around an explosion
four years ago.

13:30.936 --> 13:34.770
But if we can
figure out where and what
the explosion was,

13:34.856 --> 13:37.939
it might help us
to get closer to an ID.

13:38.026 --> 13:41.314
You gotta look
at the shrapnel itself.
That’s gonna tell you— Ah!

13:41.405 --> 13:44.897
- Sweets!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I gotcha. I gotcha.

Huh? Is she goin’
to some kind of a rave?

- Bottled water.
- Water?

Oh, it’s co-co—
[ Exhales Sharply]

14:13.770 --> 14:15.681
Oh. Actually, that
feels pretty good.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.888
Yeah. That’s pretty good.
Yeah. I like that.

14:19.109 --> 14:22.272
The metal was melted.
l have no idea what it was.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.354
Hey, does that look like
some sort of pattern to you?

14:25.449 --> 14:28.282
Like ridging around
what used to be the edges?

14:28.368 --> 14:31.030
Yeah. Kinda looks like money.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.702
Coins.

14:32.789 --> 14:35.201
Well, that would be consistent
with what Agent Booth
said about |.E.D.’s.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.908
You know, they’re filled
with whatever bits of metal
are available.

14:38.003 --> 14:41.962
Okay. So, if you live
in a country whose currency
is worthless—

14:42.049 --> 14:43.585
Not uncommon in a war zone.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.882
then coins are suddenly
the perfect stuffing
for an LED.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.592
l-l have no idea what that is
or why it excites you.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.513
There’s a Global Cultures
section of the Jeffersonian.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.637
There’s this—
this Coins of the World exhibit.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.060
So I’ll figure out the
composition of the shrapnel...

14:57.147 --> 14:59.354
and then compare it to the coins
that are in the exhibit.

14:59.441 --> 15:01.807
Ooh, fantastic!

15:01.902 --> 15:04.644
And how exactly do you plan
to do that without electricity?

It’s funny how fate
intervenes sometimes, huh?

15:10.702 --> 15:12.818

There’s no such thing as fate.
And this is not funny.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.370
Just let me make my point.
Since you find yourselves here—

15:15.457 --> 15:16.947
Trapped.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.624
You could look at it that way.
Or you can look at it
as an opportunity.

around the bush, okay?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.794

- No. Booth and l

16:37.664 --> 16:39.825
Oh, I can’t use the exhaust
system without electricity,

16:39.916 --> 16:43.408
so I thought it’d be better
to, uh, clean the bones out here
where there’s more airflow.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.789
Oh, my God!
You’re boiling body parts?

I agree.
But since we can’t
use the Medio Cam—

17:49.361 --> 17:51.147
You have to do
a penetrant test.

- I’m not familiar with that.
- Soak the bones
in a liquid dye.

17:54.282 --> 17:59.618

the compromised surfaces,
increasing the contrast.

will become clear.

Excuse me?

Nothing.
Oh, no, Mr. Bray.

We’re way past “nothing.”
What’s with the beetles?

21:32.333 --> 21:36.326
Well, Egyptians used to grind up
their shells to dye textiles.

used slave labor.

As you can see,
the length of the row...

Russian coins in their I.E.D.’s
as further protest...

26:42.852 --> 26:44.592
because the rebels wanted
their own currency.

Look. If an American civilian
was injured...

26:46.522 --> 26:48.729

there’d definitely
be press coverage.

32:17.061 --> 32:19.097
It would be odd
if we didn’t.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.725
Right. Uh, so we’re
talkin’ about this now?

32:21.816 --> 32:24.307
- We seem to be.
- [ Chuckling]

32:24.401 --> 32:29.191
I always assumed that we’d be
very compatible. Didn’t you?

32:30.950 --> 32:32.531
Well, yeah.

32:34.036 --> 32:36.197
-Because we’re both so physical.
-Right.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.280
The way we throw ourselves
into a case.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.115
We both have
excellent stamina.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.700
[Chuckling]

32:42.795 --> 32:46.504
Making love would be...
quite satisfying.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.000
Yeah.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.176
But then what?

32:53.264 --> 32:56.597
I mean, as a couple,
me and you would never—

32:56.684 --> 32:58.424
No, it wouldn’t work.

32:58.519 --> 32:59.634
[ Door Closes ]

32:59.728 --> 33:01.593
[ Sweets ]
Oh, it’s so cold.

33:01.689 --> 33:06.228
Okay, so I, uh— I talked to
the director of the Alliance
for Human Dignity.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.981
And our victim went to Albania
to investigate charges...

33:10.072 --> 33:12.688
that girls were promised
dream jobs in the US...

33:12.783 --> 33:14.774
and were never
heard from again.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.741
Human trafficking.
Yeah.

33:16.829 --> 33:20.447
And back here,
she went to neighborhoods with
a heavy Albanian population...

33:20.541 --> 33:23.954
and visited businesses that
she thought might be covers,

33:24.044 --> 33:25.375
always slipping
young women her number,

33:25.462 --> 33:27.168
telling them to call her
if they need any help.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.588
Right.
They’re sold into prostitution.
It’s a big business here in DC.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.381
And the people that make
the profit are brutal.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.468
How about now?
[Angela ]
No, it’s still not working.

33:34.555 --> 33:36.511
Well, we can always
use them for fries.

- What? How?

- We’re losing power. Come on!
- They should work
for a few hours, guys.

- More potatoes.
- I got one. I got one.
I got one.

- Guys, get on it.

- I have more wires right here.

- Ah.
- Sorry.

Dead.

34:34.823 --> 34:37.565
Angela says the victim’s phone
history was only incoming calls.

34:37.660 --> 34:39.321
That seems unusual.

34:39.411 --> 34:42.244
Unless that was the number
that she gave to women
who might need help.

34:42.331 --> 34:45.744
Right. It could’ve been
a dedicated line.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.961
Were there any calls
near time of death?

34:48.045 --> 34:51.833
One from a building, uh,
near the corner
of Hill and 27th.

34:51.924 --> 34:54.461
- Is the FBI.
gonna send anyone?
- Can’t yet.

34:54.551 --> 34:58.339
- Not until the roads are open.
- Hill and 27th
is less than a mile away.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.092
That’s great.
With us in here, it might
as well be a hundred.

35:03.018 --> 35:06.510
There might actually
be a way out of here.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.681
But you’re not gonna like it.

35:12.695 --> 35:15.437
The bolts between
the first and second seats
are rusted.

kicking or pulling orjumping—

- We can break these apart.
- Yes.

But I know
how important they are.

- We go on three.
- Wait, wait, wait. On three?

Which is more common.

It’s up to you.

screwed by the math.

- Very seriously.
- [ Chuckles ]
What are you talking about?

38:47.451 --> 38:49.442
Because if you can’t teach
our kid how to paint,

38:49.536 --> 38:52.869
then sculpture is an excellent
substitute, you know,
maybe even better.

38:52.956 --> 38:54.992
Honey, listen.

Right.

39:03.717 --> 39:05.582
You’re clever.

we can handle?

the chances are
that me and my dad...

in these seats

don’t skip any doses,

- Well, it wasn’t magic.
- Well, me and you,

40:07.489 --> 40:09.605

definitions on that word.

microwave ovens are magic.

That’s all.

40:39.229 --> 40:41.766

40:41.857 --> 40:43.893
hang back and find
that inner peace...

40:43.984 --> 40:47.067
before I, you know,
get back out there.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.692

about here, right?

and fate.

- Yes. I’m quite strong.

41:17.351 --> 41:19.182
Yeah. Well, you’ve always
been strong.

41:19.269 --> 41:23.308
You know the difference between
strength and imperviousness, right?

41:23.398 --> 41:26.231
No, not if you’re gonna
get all scientific on me.

41:26.318 --> 41:28.434
Well, uh—
[Chuckles]

41:28.528 --> 41:33.147
a substance that is
impervious to damage
doesn’t need to be strong.

41:33.241 --> 41:35.232
Hmm.

41:35.327 --> 41:39.661
When you and I met,
I was an impervious substance.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.864
Now I am a strong substance.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.539
I think I know what you mean.

41:43.627 --> 41:48.212
A time could come when
you aren’t angry anymore...

41:48.298 --> 41:50.710
and I’m strong enough to risk...

41:50.801 --> 41:55.135
losing the last
of my imperviousness.

41:55.222 --> 41:57.554
Maybe then
we could try to be together.

42:01.478 --> 42:04.265
I am going
to write down a date.

42:04.356 --> 42:07.473
And guess what that time is.
All right?

42:07.609 --> 42:10.646
I want you
to do the same.
Why?

42:10.779 --> 42:13.486
Why? Because when l was a kid,
if I wanted something
really, really bad,

42:13.573 --> 42:16.940
I’d write it down on a piece
of paper, and I’d burn it.
It was like a spell.

42:17.035 --> 42:19.242
It was bound that
my wish would come true.

42:19.329 --> 42:21.615
[ Laughing ]
Why?

42:21.707 --> 42:23.868
Why? Because it was,
well, you know—

42:23.959 --> 42:26.200
You’d burn it,
and it was released
into the universe.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.785

It’s just smoke, Booth.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.166

with no special powers.

Fine. Then what do we
have to lose? Go ahead.

42:33.385 --> 42:35.717
Come on.
Okay. How does this work?

42:35.804 --> 42:38.511
Well, write down
what you think—

Don’t look.

42:39.808 --> 42:42.015

42:44.104 --> 42:45.969

We’ll burn it, okay?
On three.

42:46.106 --> 42:48.848
Ready?
One, two—
Wait. We’re going on three?

42:48.984 --> 42:50.975
Just—
On three,
or after three?

42:51.111 --> 42:54.023
Bones, just burn it
together, okay?
Okay.

42:54.114 --> 42:58.073
One, two, three.
