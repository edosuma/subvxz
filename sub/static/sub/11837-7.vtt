WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.368
<i>SHORE: Previously</i>
<i>on "The Practice"...</i>

00:02.402 --> 00:04.003
Suddenly,
airport security comes

00:04.037 --> 00:05.639
and tells me
I have to get off

00:05.672 --> 00:07.908
because I was too fat to fly.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.175
ASHFORD: The statute
of limitations

00:09.209 --> 00:11.011
for suing us has expired.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.513
I would just tell the client
that we settled,

00:12.546 --> 00:13.714
pay them out
of my own pocket,

00:13.747 --> 00:16.248
and avoid the whole
malpractice thing.

00:16.282 --> 00:19.853
They've agreed
to pay you $10,000.

00:19.886 --> 00:21.187
Tell them no.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.689
FRUTT: This woman thinks
the airline

00:22.723 --> 00:24.725
offered her $10,000?

00:24.758 --> 00:25.859
Just help me.

00:25.892 --> 00:27.894
Tell your client the truth.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.395
There's something
you need to know.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.396
I already know.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.566
And all I can say
is thank you.

00:32.598 --> 00:34.835
Mr. Torrance came
to my house this morning.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.069
STRINGER:
He went to Melissa Kenner

00:36.102 --> 00:38.071
and pretended to be somebody
from the airline

00:38.104 --> 00:39.339
and settled the case.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.742
Well, any chance
I get to break a law.

00:42.843 --> 00:43.910
Why are we having lunch?

00:43.944 --> 00:45.946
SHORE: I think
I enjoy the company

00:45.979 --> 00:46.880
of inquisitive people.

00:46.913 --> 00:49.115
Also, I find you attractive.

00:49.149 --> 00:50.551
I was so sure

00:50.584 --> 00:52.252
after the case
was over that--

00:52.285 --> 00:53.720
SHORE:
That you were expendable?

00:53.954 --> 00:55.288
Just the opposite, Diane.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.259
It's not a Jewish thing.

00:59.292 --> 01:00.100
What is it, then?

01:00.133 --> 01:01.768
STRINGER: A man-woman thing.

01:01.802 --> 01:03.970
I want a break up.

01:04.004 --> 01:06.239
Jamie, you and I,
it's just a thing.

01:06.272 --> 01:08.675
We both know that.
It's no big deal.

01:15.015 --> 01:18.018
(music playing)

01:42.108 --> 01:43.476
What are you doing?

01:44.244 --> 01:45.779
Just looking.

01:46.947 --> 01:48.348
You're just looking?

01:50.817 --> 01:51.885
I leave.

01:56.356 --> 01:58.659
I perhaps should've shared

01:58.692 --> 02:00.534
that prior to getting intimate,

02:00.567 --> 02:01.635
but...

02:03.637 --> 02:04.538
in relationships,

02:04.571 --> 02:06.006
I leave.

02:08.709 --> 02:10.342
Are you leaving now?

02:10.376 --> 02:12.312
Only to go to work.

02:14.014 --> 02:15.448
I don't mean to suggest

02:15.481 --> 02:17.884
any waning interest
on my part.

02:17.917 --> 02:19.352
To the contrary, um,

02:20.887 --> 02:23.957
but in the spirit of honesty--

02:24.691 --> 02:25.759
You leave?

02:29.195 --> 02:32.198
(indistinct chatter)

02:42.643 --> 02:44.244
WILSON: Okay,
you'll be transported

02:44.277 --> 02:46.747
to the courthouse
tomorrow at 8:00 A. M.

02:46.780 --> 02:48.549
The trial is scheduled
for 9:00.

02:48.582 --> 02:50.517
When do I see my lawyer?

02:50.551 --> 02:51.885
Mr. Berluti will be
waiting for you

02:51.918 --> 02:53.520
at the courthouse,

02:53.554 --> 02:54.655
as will I.

02:56.590 --> 02:59.225
You might want to think
about a plea.

02:59.259 --> 03:00.501
Aggravated rape

03:00.534 --> 03:02.368
could be as much as 25 years.

03:02.402 --> 03:04.004
Can I ask you something?

03:04.037 --> 03:05.471
Certainly.

03:05.506 --> 03:07.808
WILLS: How is it that I'm going
on trial tomorrow

03:07.841 --> 03:10.210
facing 25 years,

03:10.243 --> 03:12.078
and I haven't seen
my lawyer in weeks?

03:12.112 --> 03:14.581
He's been working
on the case,

03:14.615 --> 03:17.618
and he's quite prepared.

03:17.651 --> 03:18.519
I assure you,

03:18.552 --> 03:21.021
you're in very capable hands.

03:26.226 --> 03:29.229
(music playing)

04:07.240 --> 04:08.241
YOUNG: What are these?

04:08.274 --> 04:10.376
They're for Jamie,
actually.

04:10.410 --> 04:12.012
Wow, orchids
in November.

04:12.045 --> 04:13.413
Who from?
We don't know.

04:13.446 --> 04:14.515
You ready?

04:15.315 --> 04:16.449
Uh, a little heads up,

04:16.482 --> 04:17.584
the client's slightly
perturbed,

04:17.618 --> 04:18.719
not having seen you.

04:18.752 --> 04:20.420
Okay, let's go.

04:20.452 --> 04:23.189
And Jimmy,
hold on a second.

04:23.223 --> 04:24.758
You haven't seen
your client?

04:24.791 --> 04:26.226
Not since the arraignment.

04:26.259 --> 04:28.529
Tara's been doing
the back and forth with him.

04:28.562 --> 04:30.130
I've been prepping
the case from here.

04:31.164 --> 04:32.432
Hey, you're the one who said,

04:32.465 --> 04:35.268
"Watch our time on the
court-appointed cases." Eugene.

04:35.301 --> 04:37.170
So--
I said, "Draw limits."

04:37.203 --> 04:38.638
I never said,
"Don't bother to meet

04:38.672 --> 04:39.372
with the client."

04:39.405 --> 04:41.542
I'm ready to try the case.

04:41.575 --> 04:42.609
Don't worry.

04:44.144 --> 04:45.846
Come on, Tara.

04:51.552 --> 04:52.553
Nice.

04:52.586 --> 04:53.987
Who from?

04:55.021 --> 04:57.190
This is kind of private.

04:57.223 --> 04:58.859
Somebody Jewish, I hope.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.671
SAMUEL: I arrived home,

05:04.705 --> 05:07.173
I think it was just
after 8:00 P. M.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.610
I was picking up Jessica
to go out to dinner.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.778
It was her 21st birthday.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.814
Jessica is your daughter?

05:13.847 --> 05:14.681
SAMUEL: Yes.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.282
I came into the house,

05:16.316 --> 05:18.184
and I immediately heard noise

05:18.218 --> 05:19.720
coming from somewhere.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.354
What kind of noise, sir?

05:21.722 --> 05:24.925
Well, I really couldn't
identify it at first,

05:24.958 --> 05:27.628
but then I went into
the living room

05:27.661 --> 05:29.596
and, uh, I,

05:29.630 --> 05:32.332
I saw the cause of the noise.

05:32.365 --> 05:34.635
What did you see, sir?

05:36.903 --> 05:40.373
(voice breaking)
I saw my daughter...

05:40.406 --> 05:42.676
being raped.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.611
WEBB: I know this is
difficult, sir,

05:44.645 --> 05:46.780
but can you describe
for the jury

05:46.813 --> 05:48.849
exactly what you saw?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.885
SAMUEL: Jessica
was on her back,

05:51.918 --> 05:52.853
on the floor.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.489
That man over there
was on top of her.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.492
Her pants were pulled down,

05:59.526 --> 06:01.367
his too,

06:01.401 --> 06:03.870
and he was forcing himself
inside of her.

06:04.738 --> 06:06.807
WEBB: Are you sure
this is the man

06:06.840 --> 06:08.408
you saw on top
of your daughter?

06:11.444 --> 06:12.913
SAMUEL: I am positive...

06:12.946 --> 06:14.581
it was him,

06:15.582 --> 06:17.350
it was him.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.420
WEBB: What happened next,
Mr. Palmer?

06:21.688 --> 06:23.557
I picked up a shovel

06:23.590 --> 06:25.659
by the fireplace,

06:25.692 --> 06:27.594
and I knocked him
unconscious.

06:28.595 --> 06:31.131
Then I called 911.

06:31.164 --> 06:34.568
I tied him up
with an electrical cord.

06:34.601 --> 06:37.003
The police came and got him.

06:37.337 --> 06:39.405
WEBB: And could you describe
for the jury

06:39.439 --> 06:41.141
the condition
of your daughter?

06:41.842 --> 06:43.777
She was beyond hysterical.

06:47.347 --> 06:48.615
WEBB: I'm done, Your Honor.

06:48.649 --> 06:50.951
(music playing)

07:09.109 --> 07:11.545
You said, sir,
you heard noises

07:11.578 --> 07:13.113
when you entered.

07:13.146 --> 07:14.447
Did you hear screams?

07:15.048 --> 07:16.750
I said before,
I couldn't identify

07:16.783 --> 07:17.651
the noises.

07:18.184 --> 07:20.654
BERLUTI: When you saw
what you saw,

07:20.687 --> 07:21.922
would it be fair to say

07:21.955 --> 07:23.957
it caused you
feelings of shock?

07:24.390 --> 07:26.026
That would be fair.

07:26.727 --> 07:28.662
BERLUTI: Did you see any weapon

07:28.695 --> 07:30.396
in my client's possession?

07:30.430 --> 07:32.032
No.

07:34.835 --> 07:35.869
Nothing further.

07:42.909 --> 07:44.177
You didn't do nothing!

07:44.210 --> 07:46.580
Look, Derrick, this was
the father of the victim.

07:46.613 --> 07:48.081
You got to walk a careful line.

07:48.114 --> 07:49.716
I'm the victim here,
Mr. Berluti!

07:49.750 --> 07:51.317
Do we not understand that?!

07:51.351 --> 07:52.719
BERLUTI:
In the eyes of the jury,

07:52.753 --> 07:54.387
this man was sympathetic.

07:54.420 --> 07:55.656
It would have been
a mistake for me

07:55.689 --> 07:56.389
to beat him up.

07:56.422 --> 07:57.891
So you did nothing?!

07:59.159 --> 08:00.433
No.

08:00.466 --> 08:02.435
I established that he didn't
hear screams,

08:02.468 --> 08:03.937
which, as the girl's father,

08:03.970 --> 08:05.271
he would've remembered hearing.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.073
I established that he went
into shock

08:07.107 --> 08:08.709
upon seeing the event.

08:08.742 --> 08:11.812
Shock compromises
capacity to observe.

08:11.845 --> 08:13.046
Did you explain to Mr. Mills

08:13.079 --> 08:14.180
that our theory of defense--

08:14.214 --> 08:16.883
MILLS: Why haven't you
explained it to me, huh?!

08:16.917 --> 08:17.851
She's a law student.

08:17.884 --> 08:19.052
Where the hell
have you been?!

08:20.286 --> 08:22.889
We got a problem, Mr. Mills?

08:22.923 --> 08:23.857
'Cause if we do,

08:23.890 --> 08:25.592
I got an easy suggestion.

08:25.626 --> 08:26.993
We can go see the judge,

08:27.027 --> 08:28.695
tell her you want
a different lawyer.

08:28.729 --> 08:30.130
I doubt she'll give you one

08:30.163 --> 08:30.931
middle of the trial,

08:30.964 --> 08:32.899
but, hey, it's worth a shot.

08:32.933 --> 08:33.933
You like to take your shots

08:33.967 --> 08:35.467
where you find them,
huh, Derrick?

08:35.969 --> 08:36.903
WILSON: All right.

08:37.403 --> 08:39.139
This isn't helping.

08:41.407 --> 08:43.409
He seems like
a nice guy.

08:43.443 --> 08:44.578
He's angry.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.547
Yeah, I picked up on that.

08:46.580 --> 08:48.481
Jimmy...

08:48.515 --> 08:50.183
if I could play
the role of a naive

08:50.216 --> 08:51.317
law student for a second,

08:52.986 --> 08:54.555
there's no chance
that he could be innocent,

08:54.588 --> 08:55.556
is there?

08:56.990 --> 08:58.358
What are you talking about?

08:58.391 --> 09:00.100
You're the one who's been
saying he's guilty.

09:00.133 --> 09:00.934
WILSON: I know.

09:00.967 --> 09:03.203
I'm sure that he is.

09:03.236 --> 09:05.672
It's just that
he's so indignant.

09:05.706 --> 09:07.407
Lesson number one, Tara,

09:07.440 --> 09:08.308
the guiltier they come,

09:08.341 --> 09:09.610
the more indignant they get

09:09.643 --> 09:11.344
about being arrested.

09:11.377 --> 09:13.346
Right.

09:13.379 --> 09:15.048
(sighs) Good.

09:33.867 --> 09:34.835
Is there a problem?

09:34.868 --> 09:35.536
No.

09:36.102 --> 09:37.170
Excellent.

09:39.272 --> 09:41.808
So, you are here to--

09:41.842 --> 09:44.077
Alan, I don't like
"I'm leaving"

09:44.110 --> 09:45.712
to be the first words
out of a man's mouth

09:45.746 --> 09:46.412
in the morning,

09:47.247 --> 09:48.515
especially after
I've slept with him

09:48.549 --> 09:49.215
the night before.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.789
Could we perhaps
discuss this later?

09:56.289 --> 09:58.659
Oh, I'm not here
for confrontation, Alan,

09:58.692 --> 10:01.034
only some clarity.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.303
Will we be seeing
each other again?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.138
Would tonight
be soon enough?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.473
Yes.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.309
Fine, then.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.426
The man Roland Huff shot,

10:26.459 --> 10:28.629
wasn't that his sister?

10:28.662 --> 10:29.930
I believe it was, yes.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.031
You slept with her?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.699
I did, actually.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.800
Thank you for asking.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.572
Alan.

11:07.173 --> 11:08.108
Do you mind?

11:08.141 --> 11:09.576
Sorry, I, uh, uh--

11:09.610 --> 11:10.877
Thought they were
firm flowers?

11:11.678 --> 11:12.713
Well, since they were out
in the open--

11:12.746 --> 11:14.815
I left them on my desk.

11:16.182 --> 11:17.818
Okay.

11:17.851 --> 11:18.919
Sorry.

11:22.589 --> 11:24.558
You settled
Melissa Kenner's case

11:24.591 --> 11:25.926
for $25,000?

11:27.293 --> 11:29.796
Uh, oh, yeah.

11:29.830 --> 11:30.864
She was very pleased,

11:30.897 --> 11:32.733
hence the flowers.

11:33.066 --> 11:34.200
Well, how come
you never told me

11:34.234 --> 11:35.035
about the settlement?

11:35.068 --> 11:36.236
I mean, that's a pretty
good result.

11:36.269 --> 11:38.138
Well, I don't know.

11:38.171 --> 11:40.273
I don't talk about
all my cases, Eugene.

11:40.306 --> 11:41.942
Where's the money?

11:42.509 --> 11:43.243
Sorry?

11:43.276 --> 11:44.545
YOUNG: Our contingency.

11:44.811 --> 11:46.847
There are no funds
in the client's account,

11:46.880 --> 11:48.549
so when's the money coming in?

11:48.582 --> 11:50.383
Soon.

11:50.416 --> 11:52.619
Very soon.

11:52.653 --> 11:55.188
(music playing)

12:04.004 --> 12:05.038
What's this?

12:05.071 --> 12:06.640
The contingency
on Melissa Kenner.

12:06.673 --> 12:08.675
I can't make deposits
since I'm an associate,

12:08.709 --> 12:10.376
so I'm giving it to you
as a partner.

12:10.410 --> 12:11.612
FRUTT: I'm confused.

12:11.645 --> 12:13.113
We deduct contingencies,

12:13.146 --> 12:14.615
and then we pay the client.

12:14.648 --> 12:15.982
Why is this check--
JAMIE: I forgot.

12:16.182 --> 12:17.383
The client
got the whole thing.

12:17.417 --> 12:18.952
She cut a money order for us.

12:18.985 --> 12:20.654
You forgot?

12:20.687 --> 12:22.322
You just gave the client
the whole thing?

12:22.355 --> 12:23.890
Look, we got the money.

12:23.924 --> 12:24.958
Can you just make
the deposit?

12:24.991 --> 12:26.693
Hello!

12:26.727 --> 12:27.861
Melissa!

12:27.894 --> 12:29.596
We were just talking about you.

12:29.630 --> 12:31.097
KENNER: I brought
a little surprise.

12:31.131 --> 12:31.998
Did you get my flowers?

12:32.032 --> 12:33.233
I did.

12:33.266 --> 12:34.167
Thank you so much.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.802
MELISSA:
Well, I just thought--

12:37.103 --> 12:38.271
Mr. Torrance.

12:39.973 --> 12:41.307
What are you doing here?

12:41.341 --> 12:43.409
Oh, well, I work here.

12:43.443 --> 12:44.945
KENNER: You work here?

12:44.978 --> 12:46.012
I don't understand.

12:46.613 --> 12:48.481
STRINGER: Melissa.
You work for the airline?

12:48.515 --> 12:50.083
The airline?

12:50.116 --> 12:52.318
SHORE: It's just
in-house counsel

12:52.352 --> 12:53.987
for a big airline.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.322
It just wasn't my calling.

12:56.857 --> 12:58.959
And I was so overwhelmed

12:58.992 --> 13:01.334
by Jamie's dedication to you,

13:01.367 --> 13:03.436
it so warmed

13:03.469 --> 13:05.038
the cockles of my heart,

13:05.438 --> 13:07.841
I was inspired to shift

13:07.874 --> 13:09.309
career direction.

13:09.576 --> 13:11.144
Thank you, Melissa,

13:11.177 --> 13:14.047
for both the new life

13:14.080 --> 13:16.550
and the warm cockles.

13:20.386 --> 13:21.622
JESSICA: I was trying
to find my way back

13:21.655 --> 13:24.224
to Storro Drive,

13:24.257 --> 13:27.093
and I pulled over
to ask for directions.

13:27.127 --> 13:29.029
And suddenly,

13:29.062 --> 13:30.130
he just jumped in.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.068
Who jumped in?

13:35.101 --> 13:36.336
Him.

13:36.369 --> 13:38.171
He told me he had a knife,

13:38.605 --> 13:40.373
and he told me to drive.

13:40.406 --> 13:41.842
Did you see the knife?

13:41.875 --> 13:43.376
No.

13:43.409 --> 13:44.077
WEBB: Okay.

13:44.344 --> 13:45.979
Then after he told you to drive,

13:46.012 --> 13:47.648
then what happened, Jessica?

13:47.681 --> 13:49.382
He reached inside my purse,

13:50.016 --> 13:52.385
pulled out my wallet
and my license.

13:53.219 --> 13:56.189
He saw the Beacon Hill
address.

13:56.222 --> 13:58.024
He said he wanted some nice

13:58.058 --> 13:59.860
Beacon Hill things.

14:01.401 --> 14:04.037
And he said
if we didn't go there,

14:04.070 --> 14:05.506
that he'd kill me.

14:05.539 --> 14:07.674
WEBB: So you drove
to your home?

14:07.708 --> 14:09.409
JESSICA: Yes.

14:09.442 --> 14:11.144
He just wanted some stuff

14:11.177 --> 14:13.714
to sell to get drugs,

14:14.581 --> 14:16.583
so I took him in.

14:16.950 --> 14:19.019
He looked around,

14:19.052 --> 14:19.853
and then...

14:21.021 --> 14:22.122
then he said first

14:22.155 --> 14:24.591
he wanted some...

14:24.625 --> 14:26.727
recreation.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.362
And that was the word he used

14:29.395 --> 14:30.964
"Recreation."

14:31.965 --> 14:35.368
Then he grabbed me.

14:36.870 --> 14:39.472
I tried to scream, but he--

14:41.341 --> 14:42.909
Take your time.

14:43.544 --> 14:45.712
He pushed me to the floor

14:48.214 --> 14:49.282
and...

14:50.751 --> 14:52.118
he pulled off my jeans.

14:53.754 --> 14:56.489
I was just...

14:56.523 --> 14:58.892
I was saying to myself,

14:58.925 --> 15:01.602
"Dear God...

15:01.635 --> 15:04.805
please, just let me pass out."

15:06.406 --> 15:08.542
WEBB: Did you pass out?

15:11.444 --> 15:12.478
And then,

15:13.313 --> 15:14.648
he was inside me.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.285
He was inside me.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.656
WEBB: Jessica,

15:22.689 --> 15:24.758
at any time...

15:24.791 --> 15:26.560
did you consent to having sex

15:26.593 --> 15:27.694
with the defendant?

15:28.194 --> 15:29.262
No.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.667
God, no.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.102
WEBB: Thank you, Jessica.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.449
Jessica,

15:49.482 --> 15:51.652
an allegation of rape,

15:51.685 --> 15:54.054
that's a very serious thing.

15:54.588 --> 15:56.623
When you accuse a man
of rape,

15:56.657 --> 15:58.525
he could lose his freedom.

15:58.559 --> 16:00.400
Does counsel
have a question?

16:01.935 --> 16:04.070
Did you willingly have sex
with my client

16:04.104 --> 16:06.907
only to claim rape
after your dad walked in?

16:06.940 --> 16:07.674
JESSICA: No.

16:07.708 --> 16:09.442
He forced me.

16:09.475 --> 16:10.877
BERLUTI: I see.

16:10.911 --> 16:11.945
And have you ever claimed

16:11.978 --> 16:13.413
somebody raped you before

16:13.446 --> 16:15.549
after having--
Objection!

16:15.582 --> 16:16.349
Sustained.

16:16.382 --> 16:17.584
Cut it out, counsel.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.254
BERLUTI: Isn't it true

16:21.287 --> 16:22.723
you invited my client

16:22.756 --> 16:23.757
back to your house?

16:23.790 --> 16:24.891
No.

16:26.326 --> 16:28.228
It is not true.

16:29.630 --> 16:30.831
And I did not extend

16:30.864 --> 16:33.700
an invitation to be raped.

16:39.239 --> 16:40.574
Nothing further.

16:46.813 --> 16:49.149
That went well.

16:49.182 --> 16:52.385
Jimmy, it might be
my imagination,

16:52.418 --> 16:53.954
but when you asked
if she had ever claimed

16:53.987 --> 16:56.089
rape before...
What?

16:56.122 --> 16:58.559
Well, it just seemed
that the district attorney

16:58.592 --> 17:00.734
was ready for the question.

17:00.767 --> 17:02.603
He pounced to shut it down.

17:02.636 --> 17:04.204
What are you saying?

17:04.237 --> 17:06.839
You might have stumbled
onto something.

17:11.512 --> 17:14.146
I wasn't in on it.
He just did it.

17:14.180 --> 17:15.682
He pretended to be
a representative

17:15.715 --> 17:16.782
of the airline?

17:16.817 --> 17:18.117
Yes.

17:18.151 --> 17:20.086
First, why didn't you
stop him?

17:20.119 --> 17:22.556
And second, why didn't you
tell me or Eugene?

17:22.589 --> 17:25.125
I didn't know he was going
to do it, Ellenor.

17:25.157 --> 17:26.126
And I didn't tell you

17:26.159 --> 17:28.161
to protect both him and you.

17:28.194 --> 17:31.464
Jamie, you are a second-year
associate.

17:31.497 --> 17:32.633
It is not your call

17:32.666 --> 17:33.900
whether to tell or not

17:33.934 --> 17:35.001
on something like this!

17:35.035 --> 17:36.837
The guy went to bat for me.

17:36.870 --> 17:39.272
How--
FRUTT: I don't care.

17:39.305 --> 17:40.473
You report to a superior,

17:40.507 --> 17:42.042
either me or Eugene,

17:42.075 --> 17:43.577
no exceptions.

17:51.852 --> 17:53.153
Alan...

17:53.453 --> 17:55.121
could you come
into my office, please?

17:56.356 --> 17:57.991
Have I been bad?

18:00.734 --> 18:02.168
WILSON: Oh God, Jimmy.

18:02.202 --> 18:02.969
Here it is.

18:03.637 --> 18:04.370
What?

18:04.404 --> 18:05.606
Page 32.

18:05.639 --> 18:07.508
"Victim's father reports

18:07.541 --> 18:09.543
two previous unconfirmed

18:09.576 --> 18:11.978
claims of rape.

18:12.012 --> 18:13.747
Investigated.

18:13.780 --> 18:16.116
Unsubstantiated.
Unsubstantiated.

18:16.149 --> 18:18.018
No arrests made.

18:26.126 --> 18:28.461
How could we have missed this?

18:29.262 --> 18:32.966
It's practically
a scribbled footnote.

18:32.999 --> 18:35.435
Look, it notes even
the father doubted

18:35.468 --> 18:37.804
the validity
of the prior claims.

18:45.378 --> 18:46.412
She tells her father

18:46.446 --> 18:48.882
she was raped, twice.

18:48.915 --> 18:52.152
The claims are dismissed.

18:52.185 --> 18:54.254
So she sets it up

18:54.287 --> 18:56.757
for him to walk in on her,

18:56.790 --> 18:59.893
so he'd have to believe her.

18:59.926 --> 19:02.936
(music playing)

19:09.375 --> 19:11.244
You got fired
from your last firm

19:11.277 --> 19:12.513
for embezzling.
Allegedly.

19:12.546 --> 19:13.514
You threatened extortion

19:13.547 --> 19:14.380
your first week here.

19:14.414 --> 19:15.381
That was an accident.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.717
Break privilege,
for which you almost

19:16.750 --> 19:17.551
got disbarred.

19:17.584 --> 19:18.284
Horseshoes.

19:18.318 --> 19:19.653
Sleep with witnesses.

19:19.686 --> 19:20.554
Just the one.

19:20.587 --> 19:21.522
And now I find out

19:21.555 --> 19:22.756
you actually impersonated

19:22.789 --> 19:23.857
an opposing party

19:23.890 --> 19:25.191
so you could settle a case.

19:25.959 --> 19:27.661
That's not just fraud,

19:27.694 --> 19:29.696
that's probably criminal.

19:31.031 --> 19:34.434
Alan, look at me.

19:34.467 --> 19:37.437
You are seriously
self-destructive.

19:37.470 --> 19:39.039
Isn't everybody?

19:39.439 --> 19:42.809
Look, I adore you,
you know that

19:42.843 --> 19:46.079
but this firm is my life.

19:48.515 --> 19:50.283
I have to tell Eugene.

19:52.352 --> 19:54.788
May I ask why?

19:54.821 --> 19:56.222
FRUTT: He's a fellow partner.

19:56.557 --> 19:59.526
I have a fiduciary
responsibility to him.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.433
And you are exposing him

20:00.466 --> 20:01.902
to enormous liability,

20:01.935 --> 20:04.505
as you are Jimmy and me.

20:05.539 --> 20:08.474
Alan, you are
an amazing lawyer

20:09.610 --> 20:11.311
but I don't think

20:11.344 --> 20:12.846
it's gonna work out here.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.282
Are you firing me?

20:16.316 --> 20:18.719
I'm gonna talk to Eugene,

20:18.752 --> 20:19.820
but...

20:21.588 --> 20:22.422
I...

20:22.455 --> 20:23.223
But you don't think

20:23.256 --> 20:25.025
it's gonna work out here?

20:35.702 --> 20:37.771
The difficult thing
about firing him--

20:37.804 --> 20:39.973
Aside from him
being your friend.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.241
Is that, once again,

20:41.274 --> 20:43.176
he fell on the sword
for somebody else,

20:43.209 --> 20:44.244
this time for the firm,

20:44.277 --> 20:46.346
as well as for Jamie.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.948
And he did save us

20:47.981 --> 20:49.315
from a malpractice judgment.

20:49.550 --> 20:51.084
And possibly exposed us

20:51.117 --> 20:52.753
to something much worse.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.692
Eugene...

20:58.725 --> 20:59.926
since I am his friend,

20:59.960 --> 21:02.068
I'm gonna have to let you
make the call here.

21:03.604 --> 21:05.405
In the spirit of objectivity,

21:05.438 --> 21:08.742
I just can't bring
myself to do it.

21:10.076 --> 21:11.144
Okay.

21:14.648 --> 21:15.716
Ellenor...

21:18.018 --> 21:19.920
in the spirit of objectivity,

21:19.953 --> 21:22.055
you're gonna have to deal
with Jamie.

21:22.088 --> 21:24.525
She's complicit, too.

21:30.230 --> 21:31.598
KITTLESON:
All right, Mr. Berluti,

21:31.965 --> 21:33.366
you may begin
your defense.

21:33.800 --> 21:34.835
Thank you, Your Honor.

21:34.868 --> 21:37.971
The defense recalls
Jessica Palmer.

21:38.872 --> 21:40.907
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but if this involves

21:40.941 --> 21:42.342
a continuation of cross--

21:42.375 --> 21:43.276
This is something new.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.178
WEBB: Well, I'd appreciate
a proffer.

21:45.211 --> 21:47.413
Counsel, step up.

21:52.152 --> 21:53.554
What is going on?

21:53.587 --> 21:54.721
Evidence has come to light

21:54.755 --> 21:57.658
that Ms. Palmer has made
claims of rape before,

21:57.691 --> 21:58.825
and I'd like--
This is rape shield.

21:58.859 --> 21:59.793
You can't get into this.

21:59.826 --> 22:01.034
I can't get into it?

22:01.067 --> 22:03.103
None of us will get
into it here.

22:03.136 --> 22:04.337
Chambers.

22:06.707 --> 22:08.675
Her sexual past
is off-limits.

22:08.709 --> 22:10.076
Any questions
relating to her--

22:10.110 --> 22:11.778
This goes to her credibility,

22:11.812 --> 22:13.413
not her sexual past.

22:13.446 --> 22:15.616
This woman alleged rape
how many times?

22:15.649 --> 22:17.818
BERLUTI: Two,
both times to her father,

22:17.851 --> 22:19.085
who was dubious himself--

22:19.119 --> 22:20.020
You can't say this.

22:20.053 --> 22:21.387
I can't say it?

22:21.421 --> 22:22.823
If she goes around
claiming rape--

22:22.856 --> 22:23.890
WEBB: First of all,

22:23.924 --> 22:26.126
you can't prove these claims
were false,

22:26.159 --> 22:27.861
and even if you could,

22:27.894 --> 22:29.663
it still falls
within rape shield.

22:30.163 --> 22:31.798
False rape accusations

22:31.832 --> 22:33.534
by the victim
are not admissible

22:33.567 --> 22:36.570
unless a four-prong test
is satisfied,

22:36.970 --> 22:38.505
one prong being...

22:38.539 --> 22:41.241
the victim is the only
prosecution witness,

22:41.274 --> 22:43.243
which here she isn't.

22:43.276 --> 22:45.111
We have an eyewitness
to the rape.

22:45.145 --> 22:46.246
Her father.

22:46.279 --> 22:47.247
It doesn't matter.

22:47.581 --> 22:50.316
I'm not looking to impugn
the woman's sexual past.

22:50.350 --> 22:52.553
This is only being
introduced to impeach--

22:52.586 --> 22:54.187
KITTLESON: I understand,

22:54.220 --> 22:57.157
but there's no
impeachment exception,

22:57.190 --> 22:58.258
and even if there were,

22:58.291 --> 23:00.534
you have a slew
of problems, counsel.

23:00.567 --> 23:02.736
First, Mr. Webb
states the law correctly.

23:02.969 --> 23:04.571
Your Honor--
KITTLESON: And second,

23:04.605 --> 23:06.072
victim's testimony...

23:06.106 --> 23:08.742
has to be confused
or inconsistent.

23:08.775 --> 23:09.910
Hers wasn't.

23:09.943 --> 23:11.978
Let me question her.
KITTLESON: And third,

23:12.245 --> 23:14.214
you have to file all questions

23:14.247 --> 23:17.751
regarding her sexual past
before trial.

23:17.784 --> 23:18.585
You didn't.

23:18.619 --> 23:19.953
Because I didn't know.

23:19.986 --> 23:20.921
And whose fault is that?

23:20.954 --> 23:22.623
It was in the file.

23:22.656 --> 23:23.323
Did you read it?

23:24.090 --> 23:25.325
They buried it
deep in the file,

23:25.358 --> 23:26.259
barely a footnote.

23:26.292 --> 23:27.894
They didn't want us
to find it.

23:28.094 --> 23:29.329
But it was there.

23:30.964 --> 23:33.066
Your Honor, come on.

23:33.099 --> 23:34.935
This woman has perhaps

23:34.968 --> 23:37.704
falsely claimed rape before.

23:37.738 --> 23:38.839
How could it be possible

23:38.872 --> 23:41.174
that the jury
doesn't get to hear this?

23:41.341 --> 23:42.509
You can write
your congressman

23:42.543 --> 23:45.211
if you don't like
the law, counsel.

23:45.245 --> 23:48.014
In here,
we simply follow it.

23:48.048 --> 23:50.450
Any and all evidence

23:50.483 --> 23:53.219
of prior rape accusations

23:53.253 --> 23:55.689
will not be introduced.

24:03.469 --> 24:05.539
You can't even raise it?

24:05.572 --> 24:07.107
No.

24:08.041 --> 24:09.843
How could this possibly be?

24:12.445 --> 24:14.314
There are specific laws.

24:15.582 --> 24:18.318
Don't I have the right
to confront my accuser?

24:19.152 --> 24:22.122
Unfortunately,
not in rape cases.

24:24.057 --> 24:26.560
Look, I know this is unfair.

24:28.294 --> 24:30.330
I don't know what to say.

24:31.698 --> 24:33.033
So what happens next?

24:34.200 --> 24:37.337
We put you up,
you tell your story.

24:40.841 --> 24:42.042
WILSON: Derrick,

24:42.375 --> 24:45.345
as entitled as you are
to your anger,

24:45.378 --> 24:46.913
you can't let it
overtake you in there.

24:46.947 --> 24:48.582
This is important.

24:48.615 --> 24:52.553
Anger is consistent
with a rapist.

24:52.586 --> 24:54.187
You need
to keep it together.

25:02.002 --> 25:03.436
I'm not firing you.

25:04.470 --> 25:06.773
But if this were a big firm

25:06.807 --> 25:10.476
or perhaps any firm
other than this one,

25:10.511 --> 25:12.378
you would be fired.

25:12.412 --> 25:13.514
You do know that?

25:16.650 --> 25:18.418
What's happening to Alan?

25:19.052 --> 25:21.888
It's Eugene's decision, so...

25:21.922 --> 25:23.389
he's likely gone.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.931
Did you hear
what I just said?

25:30.964 --> 25:32.298
SHORE: I did.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.837
Well...

25:36.870 --> 25:38.471
do you have a response?

25:38.705 --> 25:40.173
I'm sure I do.

25:41.808 --> 25:44.210
But I'm distracted
at the moment.

25:44.244 --> 25:45.746
Could I get back to you?

25:48.815 --> 25:50.851
I have given you
an opportunity.

25:50.884 --> 25:53.086
Perhaps your last opportunity

25:53.119 --> 25:54.555
to account for yourself.

25:56.289 --> 25:59.192
You need to tell me
your thinking now.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.166
SHORE: Eugene, trust me,

26:00.200 --> 26:01.467
if I shared my thoughts
with you,

26:01.501 --> 26:03.169
you'd regard them
as disrespectful

26:03.203 --> 26:05.506
rather than a product
of my preoccupation,

26:05.539 --> 26:07.808
which I assure you, is...

26:07.841 --> 26:09.242
all it is.

26:09.643 --> 26:11.111
Talk.

26:12.278 --> 26:13.547
Okay.

26:15.916 --> 26:17.751
I went to bed with a...

26:17.784 --> 26:19.920
lovely woman
the other night.

26:19.953 --> 26:23.456
She had an extremely
fetching body,

26:23.489 --> 26:25.491
which...

26:25.526 --> 26:26.927
believe it or not,

26:26.960 --> 26:29.863
I wasn't aware of
prior to the lovemaking.

26:30.664 --> 26:32.365
The reason for that is,

26:33.066 --> 26:36.069
she dresses
to desexualize herself,

26:37.403 --> 26:40.073
and that led me to believe

26:40.106 --> 26:41.508
there's perhaps some...

26:41.542 --> 26:42.709
dark back story

26:42.743 --> 26:45.145
I'm not privy to.

26:45.178 --> 26:47.480
I do know she seem sad,

26:48.549 --> 26:51.217
and then it got me
to thinking

26:51.685 --> 26:54.688
most of my relationships
have been with sad women

26:55.689 --> 26:57.323
and I was wondering why.

26:57.357 --> 26:59.960
What does that say about me?

27:02.002 --> 27:05.238
In the end,
it always comes back to me.

27:11.277 --> 27:12.579
Comments?

27:15.782 --> 27:17.651
She picked you up?

27:18.184 --> 27:19.252
Yes.

27:19.285 --> 27:20.854
I was on my way home
from work.

27:21.054 --> 27:22.388
BERLUTI: What do you do, sir?

27:22.422 --> 27:24.424
MILLS: I'm a foreman
at a furniture warehouse.

27:24.457 --> 27:27.160
I was on my way home,
walking down Tremont, and...

27:27.193 --> 27:28.862
she pulled over
to ask me for directions.

27:29.295 --> 27:30.831
BERLUTI: Jessica Palmer?

27:30.864 --> 27:31.932
MILLS: Yes.

27:31.965 --> 27:33.700
And then she
started talking me up.

27:34.167 --> 27:36.469
Then she asked me
if I wanted to climb in

27:36.503 --> 27:38.271
and go for a drive.

27:38.404 --> 27:40.574
She invited you into her car?

27:40.607 --> 27:41.407
MILLS: I know.

27:41.642 --> 27:43.043
It struck me as strange, too.

27:43.309 --> 27:45.011
Plus she seemed shy, so...

27:45.045 --> 27:46.613
what she was saying
wasn't exactly

27:46.647 --> 27:48.381
in keeping with her
scared-like personality,

27:48.815 --> 27:49.916
but that's what happened.

27:49.950 --> 27:50.617
BERLUTI: Okay.

27:51.217 --> 27:53.253
So, you got in?
MILLS: Yes.

27:53.286 --> 27:55.756
Then she started talking about
it was her 21st birthday

27:55.789 --> 27:57.624
and telling me how she had
lived a sheltered life

27:57.658 --> 27:59.225
and how she hadn't lived,

27:59.259 --> 28:00.634
how she hadn't done
wild things,

28:00.667 --> 28:02.468
and stuff like that.
And the next thing,

28:02.503 --> 28:04.104
she's inviting me back
to her place.

28:04.137 --> 28:05.238
Just like that?

28:05.271 --> 28:06.472
MILLS: Just like that.

28:06.807 --> 28:08.108
It's the truth.

28:08.341 --> 28:09.876
BERLUTI: And you said yes?

28:10.143 --> 28:11.812
Attractive women
don't pull over every day

28:11.845 --> 28:13.547
and invite me home.

28:13.580 --> 28:16.449
So, what happened
after you got to her place?

28:16.883 --> 28:18.585
MILLS: We went inside.

28:18.619 --> 28:20.887
She was very forward,
sexually.

28:20.921 --> 28:23.223
She said it was like some kind
of fantasy of hers.

28:23.690 --> 28:25.926
She wanted to pick up
some guy in her car and...

28:25.959 --> 28:27.928
bring him home
and make love to him,

28:27.961 --> 28:29.429
and I made some crack like,

28:29.663 --> 28:31.497
"Yeah, it's my fantasy, too."

28:31.532 --> 28:33.299
I mean, she didn't even want
to go in her bedroom.

28:33.333 --> 28:34.300
She wanted to make love

28:34.334 --> 28:37.504
right there on the floor,
be wild.

28:37.538 --> 28:40.841
Mr. Mills, this sounds like
a very aggressive woman.

28:40.874 --> 28:42.676
MILLS: I know,
and she had that same

28:42.709 --> 28:45.011
shy demeanor as she had
in this witness chair.

28:45.045 --> 28:47.347
It didn't make sense,
but that's what she said.

28:47.380 --> 28:49.983
She wanted to have sex,
and we did,

28:50.016 --> 28:52.485
and in the middle,
her father comes in

28:52.519 --> 28:54.588
and hits me with a shovel,

28:54.621 --> 28:56.222
and that's what happened.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.959
As God is my witness,
that's what happened.

29:01.568 --> 29:03.436
WEBB: The problem is,
we have another witness,

29:03.469 --> 29:05.205
and he saw you
committing a rape.

29:05.506 --> 29:06.907
MILLS: We were making love,

29:06.940 --> 29:08.274
which she consented to.

29:08.308 --> 29:10.544
WEBB: This woman picks up
a total stranger,

29:10.577 --> 29:12.779
drives him to her home
in Beacon Hill,

29:12.813 --> 29:14.280
and ask him
to make love to her?

29:14.414 --> 29:15.381
Yes.

29:15.415 --> 29:17.217
You wouldn't go
into somebody's house...

29:17.250 --> 29:19.185
uninvited,
would you, Mr. Mills?

29:21.254 --> 29:24.457
Ever been convicted
of a crime, sir?

29:24.490 --> 29:25.325
Ten years ago.

29:25.692 --> 29:26.627
WEBB: Breaking and entering.

29:26.660 --> 29:27.828
That's not who I am today.

29:27.861 --> 29:28.562
WEBB: One assault.

29:28.595 --> 29:29.563
I was a kid back then.

29:29.596 --> 29:30.897
I'm a 30-year-old man now.

29:30.931 --> 29:32.132
I've made a life for myself.

29:34.434 --> 29:36.036
Why didn't you
wear a condom?

29:38.304 --> 29:39.540
I didn't have one.

29:39.573 --> 29:40.574
Neither did she.

29:40.607 --> 29:42.242
WEBB: Gee, that seems odd.

29:42.275 --> 29:45.846
This woman solicits
a total stranger for sex,

29:45.879 --> 29:48.549
and she's not going
to have a condom?

29:48.582 --> 29:50.984
That's a death wish,
isn't it, Mr. Mills?

29:51.017 --> 29:53.086
Yeah, well, maybe
she's got a death wish.

29:53.119 --> 29:54.254
Maybe she has some disease

29:54.287 --> 29:55.321
where she needs to fake it--

29:55.355 --> 29:56.156
Move to strike.

29:56.189 --> 29:57.090
Mr. Mills.

29:57.123 --> 29:57.891
Well, what can I say?

29:57.924 --> 29:58.859
KITTLESON: Mr. Mills,

29:58.892 --> 30:00.060
I'll direct you to answer

30:00.093 --> 30:01.668
the district attorney's
questions.

30:01.702 --> 30:02.803
He asked me
if she had a death wish.

30:02.836 --> 30:03.937
It goes to her disease.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.506
KITTLESON: Mr. Mills,
I sincerely

30:05.539 --> 30:07.440
don't want
to prejudice your case.

30:08.208 --> 30:10.110
Members of the jury,
there is no evidence

30:10.143 --> 30:13.179
before you concerning
the victim having a disease.

30:13.213 --> 30:15.448
You are to disregard such rants
from the defendant.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.316
BERLUTI: Objection.

30:17.417 --> 30:18.985
He's not ranting, Your Honor--
KITTLESON: Mr. Berluti,

30:19.019 --> 30:21.121
we can stop this
proceeding right now

30:21.154 --> 30:23.356
and complicate
everybody's lives.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.592
There are rules of evidence.

30:25.626 --> 30:29.530
We will all play
by those rules.

30:32.599 --> 30:33.299
Mr. Webb?

30:33.867 --> 30:35.035
I'm done, Your Honor.

30:35.435 --> 30:36.970
Very wise decision.

30:49.850 --> 30:50.851
Hey.

30:50.884 --> 30:52.052
Hey.

30:53.987 --> 30:55.021
Did you fire him?

30:55.956 --> 30:58.058
Don't ask me why, but no.

30:59.092 --> 31:00.333
Maybe you like him.

31:00.366 --> 31:01.334
I do not like that man.

31:01.367 --> 31:02.669
It had nothing to do with that.

31:05.371 --> 31:06.973
You fired Jamie?

31:08.374 --> 31:09.342
No.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.549
How you doing, Eugene?

31:16.249 --> 31:17.250
Me?

31:17.283 --> 31:18.552
Fine.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.555
Okay.

31:26.159 --> 31:29.095
(door opens and closes)

31:30.997 --> 31:34.000
(overlapping chatter)

31:40.273 --> 31:41.708
What are you doing here?

31:42.075 --> 31:43.777
I just came in for a drink.

31:43.810 --> 31:45.445
I didn't know you'd be here.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.715
I'm here every night,
and you know it.

31:52.218 --> 31:54.755
You had the discretion
to let that stuff in--

31:54.788 --> 31:57.157
Get lost or I'll hold you
in contempt.

31:57.190 --> 31:58.825
BERLUTI: I'll risk contempt.

31:59.025 --> 32:01.234
That woman cries wolf
with rape.

32:01.267 --> 32:02.536
She set the whole thing up

32:02.569 --> 32:04.270
for her father to walk in on.

32:04.304 --> 32:06.239
Prove it in court, Jimmy.

32:06.272 --> 32:07.841
BERLUTI:
My client is innocent.

32:07.874 --> 32:09.209
You know it.

32:09.242 --> 32:11.177
That's probably why
you're in here getting drunk.

32:11.812 --> 32:14.080
Wrong again.
I get drunk every night.

32:16.683 --> 32:18.585
I know you, Roberta.

32:18.619 --> 32:19.720
I know your heart.

32:19.753 --> 32:22.556
I know your sense of fairness.

32:22.589 --> 32:23.857
This is something you can fix.

32:23.890 --> 32:25.859
Jimmy, you are a lawyer

32:25.892 --> 32:28.261
appearing before me in a trial.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.963
This is ex parte.

32:30.731 --> 32:31.898
After this case is over,

32:31.932 --> 32:34.367
if you wanna sit
next to me, fine.

32:34.400 --> 32:35.636
We can share a drink.

32:35.669 --> 32:38.004
Who knows? I might even
wet your whistle after,

32:38.038 --> 32:41.908
but for now,
get your ass off that stool.

32:43.944 --> 32:46.379
You're a vulgar,
desperate woman.

32:46.747 --> 32:49.716
All the more reason
to remain a good judge, then.

32:50.784 --> 32:52.619
Now, beat it.

33:10.276 --> 33:11.812
WEBB: You heard the victim.

33:11.845 --> 33:13.780
You heard from an eyewitness

33:13.814 --> 33:16.382
who saw the rape in progress.

33:16.416 --> 33:19.152
The defendant says
it was consensual.

33:19.185 --> 33:21.955
Consensual sex
does not look like rape,

33:21.988 --> 33:23.590
ladies and gentlemen.

33:23.624 --> 33:26.492
And consider the logic
of what the defendant

33:26.527 --> 33:28.194
is asking you to believe,

33:28.228 --> 33:31.064
that Jessica Palmer
picked up a strange man,

33:31.097 --> 33:31.832
a felon,

33:31.865 --> 33:34.234
in a terrible section of town,

33:34.267 --> 33:35.501
brought him back to her place

33:35.536 --> 33:39.239
to have unprotected sex,
all the while knowing

33:39.272 --> 33:41.274
her father would either be there

33:41.307 --> 33:42.743
or be there shortly.

33:43.109 --> 33:44.578
That really...

33:44.611 --> 33:46.613
sounds credible,
doesn't it?

33:47.447 --> 33:50.584
And what would be her motive
for making this up?

33:51.818 --> 33:54.320
Because rape trials are fun?

33:56.657 --> 33:58.925
The eyewitness was her father,

33:58.959 --> 34:01.234
who basically admitted
he went into shock

34:01.267 --> 34:02.769
as soon as
he entered the room.

34:02.803 --> 34:05.071
Can we completely trust
his version

34:05.105 --> 34:06.973
of what he thinks he saw?

34:07.440 --> 34:08.574
No.

34:08.609 --> 34:12.846
This case comes down
to Jessica Palmer's word

34:12.879 --> 34:14.313
against Derrick Mills.

34:14.347 --> 34:16.949
Might you be more
inclined to believe her?

34:16.983 --> 34:19.820
Sure. Okay.

34:19.853 --> 34:22.355
But can we know
she's telling the truth

34:22.388 --> 34:25.091
beyond all reasonable doubt?

34:25.491 --> 34:27.327
And you wanna talk
about logic?

34:27.360 --> 34:30.163
My client's prints
were all over the car,

34:30.196 --> 34:31.496
all over the house.

34:31.532 --> 34:32.899
He's got a record.

34:32.933 --> 34:35.835
His prints are on file
with the police.

34:35.869 --> 34:37.036
He's gonna rape somebody

34:37.070 --> 34:40.106
and leave that kind of
evidence behind?

34:40.139 --> 34:41.507
He's gonna leave his semen there

34:41.542 --> 34:43.744
for easy DNA identification?

34:43.777 --> 34:46.012
Does that make sense to you?

34:46.045 --> 34:49.215
Something's going on here,
folks.

34:50.016 --> 34:51.217
The D. A. asks,

34:51.251 --> 34:53.119
"What would be her motive
to lie?"

34:53.987 --> 34:55.621
We can't know.

34:55.656 --> 34:57.090
We have rape shield laws

34:57.123 --> 35:00.567
that prohibit us
from getting into her story,

35:01.702 --> 35:03.770
but let me ask you this,

35:03.804 --> 35:06.973
does it feel like
you've got the whole story?

35:08.274 --> 35:09.576
Does it?

35:21.888 --> 35:23.189
Are you not going to work today?

35:23.957 --> 35:25.559
I am. I just thought I might...

35:25.592 --> 35:27.093
hover a bit this morning.

35:30.664 --> 35:32.332
What are you thinking?

35:33.600 --> 35:35.168
Why does everybody so readily

35:35.201 --> 35:36.970
ask that question today?

35:37.003 --> 35:39.139
It's as common as
"How's the weather?"

35:40.206 --> 35:41.474
It's cheating.

35:41.508 --> 35:44.477
People should be required
to figure it out.

35:51.017 --> 35:53.253
Has a man ever asked you
to disrobe?

35:55.188 --> 35:56.222
I don't mean go to bed.

35:56.256 --> 35:58.525
I mean,
simply asked you to disrobe

35:58.559 --> 36:01.234
from across the room
so he might look at you?

36:02.402 --> 36:03.570
No.

36:04.170 --> 36:05.772
Would you like
to be asked that?

36:07.941 --> 36:09.075
I don't know.

36:10.176 --> 36:12.145
Like I said,
I've never been asked.

36:13.847 --> 36:15.682
Would you like to be asked?

36:18.785 --> 36:19.986
Yes.

36:21.655 --> 36:22.923
Interesting.

36:34.835 --> 36:37.538
If you think I'm asking
only because you want me to,

36:37.571 --> 36:40.674
I assure you,
I'm being genuine.

36:44.244 --> 36:46.412
Would you take off your robe?

36:48.782 --> 36:51.785
(music playing)

37:20.987 --> 37:22.355
How long have they been out?

37:23.824 --> 37:25.491
Almost five hours,

37:25.526 --> 37:27.594
which my guess it's good.

37:28.261 --> 37:31.064
It means they at least got
to be asking questions.

37:31.397 --> 37:32.666
Yeah.

37:32.699 --> 37:34.134
Can I talk to you
for a second?

37:46.780 --> 37:49.850
It was in the file that she had
claimed rape before?

37:54.420 --> 37:55.622
So if you had filed
your questions

37:55.656 --> 37:57.490
with the court
as required,

37:57.524 --> 37:58.825
you probably would've been able

37:58.859 --> 38:00.200
to cross-examine
the victim on it.

38:00.233 --> 38:03.136
You don't need
to tell me, okay?

38:03.870 --> 38:06.239
You and I both know

38:06.272 --> 38:08.575
the idea that every defendant

38:08.609 --> 38:10.744
is entitled
to an adequate defense...

38:10.777 --> 38:11.578
is a lie.

38:12.679 --> 38:14.414
Defense lawyers many times

38:14.447 --> 38:16.416
barely bother
to meet the client

38:16.449 --> 38:17.350
or read the files.

38:17.383 --> 38:19.219
Some even doze during trials.

38:19.252 --> 38:21.922
Lawyers phone it in
all the time,

38:21.955 --> 38:23.256
but for it to happen here,

38:24.858 --> 38:26.392
for a lawyer in this firm

38:26.426 --> 38:29.095
to be as blatantly unprepared,

38:29.129 --> 38:31.431
court-appointed or not--

38:31.464 --> 38:33.800
If we lose,

38:33.834 --> 38:38.138
I'll prepare the inadequate
defense appeal myself.

38:40.406 --> 38:43.409
(phone ringing)

38:46.346 --> 38:47.480
Yeah?

38:49.015 --> 38:50.216
Okay.

38:52.085 --> 38:53.554
Your jury's back.

38:56.122 --> 38:58.592
(music playing)

38:58.625 --> 39:00.701
KITTLESON:
Will the defendant please rise?

39:06.439 --> 39:08.909
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

39:09.843 --> 39:10.744
We have, Your Honor.

39:12.746 --> 39:13.914
What say you?

39:15.048 --> 39:16.650
Commonwealth
versus Derrick Mills,

39:16.683 --> 39:19.252
on the charge
of forcible rape,

39:19.953 --> 39:22.589
we find the defendant,
Derrick Mills...

39:23.724 --> 39:24.457
guilty.

39:27.661 --> 39:29.162
KITTLESON:
This concludes your service.

39:29.462 --> 39:30.964
The court thanks you.

39:30.997 --> 39:32.933
Security will take
the defendant into custody.

39:34.167 --> 39:35.001
We are adjourned.

39:35.035 --> 39:36.402
(gavel bangs)

39:36.436 --> 39:39.439
(overlapping chatter)

39:41.842 --> 39:42.843
Derrick,

39:45.378 --> 39:46.513
Derrick, look at me.

39:49.415 --> 39:51.585
I will get you out.

39:51.618 --> 39:53.920
Whatever I have to do,

39:53.954 --> 39:55.889
I will get you out.

40:01.668 --> 40:03.236
(sighs)

40:04.638 --> 40:07.641
(music playing)

40:31.264 --> 40:32.833
Where's Jimmy now?

40:32.866 --> 40:34.968
WILSON: He went home.

40:35.001 --> 40:36.603
He's pretty devastated.

40:36.637 --> 40:38.805
Call him. He needs to get
to work on the appeal.

40:38.839 --> 40:41.474
Eugene, I should've
caught this, too.

40:41.875 --> 40:43.777
Yes, you should have,

40:43.810 --> 40:45.812
but you're a third-year
law student.

40:45.846 --> 40:46.947
He's not.

40:50.416 --> 40:52.318
You're not gonna ask me
for my thoughts, are you?

40:56.823 --> 40:57.490
Eugene,

40:59.626 --> 41:00.834
Ellenor said something
about me

41:00.867 --> 41:02.268
being self-destructive.

41:02.302 --> 41:04.370
It was probably
just conversation filler,

41:04.404 --> 41:06.540
I really don't know.

41:06.573 --> 41:07.974
But I assure you,

41:08.008 --> 41:11.144
if I am unwittingly
or unconsciously

41:11.177 --> 41:13.714
trying to take anybody down,

41:13.747 --> 41:15.582
it isn't you

41:15.616 --> 41:17.283
or this law firm.

41:26.492 --> 41:28.261
(glass clinking)

41:28.294 --> 41:30.330
KITTLESON: You're on my stool.

41:38.071 --> 41:38.839
I'm sorry.

41:39.873 --> 41:41.808
Your ruling was correct.

41:43.109 --> 41:44.310
And any--

41:46.513 --> 41:49.015
this was my doing.

41:49.049 --> 41:51.184
I just came to say that.

41:55.956 --> 41:58.291
Now that the case is over,
I was...

41:58.324 --> 42:00.233
wondering if your offer
is still good.

42:03.169 --> 42:05.338
I mean,
to have a drink together.

42:06.339 --> 42:09.209
The case isn't over.

42:09.242 --> 42:11.011
There's still sentencing.

42:14.480 --> 42:16.249
But I suppose
there's nothing wrong

42:16.282 --> 42:19.252
in drinking separately
on adjacent stools,

42:20.286 --> 42:24.057
enjoying the illusion
of company, I guess.

42:27.694 --> 42:29.295
I could use it.

42:33.433 --> 42:35.168
So could I.

42:35.201 --> 42:38.204
(music playing)

43:01.301 --> 43:04.337
(music playing)

43:27.728 --> 43:28.695
WOMAN: You stinker.

43:28.729 --> 43:31.532
(music playing)
