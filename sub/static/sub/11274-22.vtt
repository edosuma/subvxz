Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:05.221 --> 00:07.524
Well, I'm off, Sam.

00:07.524 --> 00:09.526
Sixth row center

00:09.526 --> 00:11.027
for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

00:11.027 --> 00:12.529
I still have the extra ticket

00:12.529 --> 00:15.532
if you happened to
have changed your mind.

00:15.532 --> 00:17.033
I-I just don't like that stuff.

00:17.033 --> 00:19.035
All those guys jumping around

00:19.035 --> 00:21.037
stabbing each other
in their leotards. I...

00:21.538 --> 00:23.540
I'm sorry.

00:23.540 --> 00:24.541
Come on.

00:24.541 --> 00:26.042
I don't want to go alone.

00:26.042 --> 00:27.043
I-I know. I know.

00:27.043 --> 00:28.044
Did I hear right?

00:28.044 --> 00:29.546
You're leaving early?

00:29.546 --> 00:31.047
I'm going to a play.

00:31.047 --> 00:34.551
Fine. I'll just stay here,
work my butt to the bone,

00:35.051 --> 00:38.054
while the boss's fiancée
takes another day off.

00:38.054 --> 00:39.556
SAM: Hey, come on. We're
not that busy around here.

00:39.556 --> 00:41.057
What're you doing?

00:41.057 --> 00:43.059
As a matter of fact, why don't...

00:43.059 --> 00:45.562
why don't you go to the play with Diane?

00:45.562 --> 00:46.429
Ha.

00:48.181 --> 00:49.682
How about it, Carla?

00:49.682 --> 00:52.068
We rarely do things together.

00:52.068 --> 00:54.738
We never do things together.

00:54.738 --> 00:56.189
It'll be fun.

00:56.189 --> 00:59.692
It'll broaden your horizons.

00:59.692 --> 01:00.693
You... what're you saying?

01:01.194 --> 01:02.195
I-I'm going to get the afternoon off

01:02.195 --> 01:05.197
if I go to the play with Bleachbag?

01:05.197 --> 01:07.700
Only if you go to the
play with Bleachbag.

01:07.700 --> 01:08.501
It's a deal.

01:08.501 --> 01:10.920
(laughs): I'm so excited.

01:10.920 --> 01:13.373
I've been waiting months for
this production to arrive.

01:13.373 --> 01:14.758
Sounds good.

01:14.758 --> 01:16.509
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

01:16.509 --> 01:18.711
I'll bring the pork
rinds, you bring the beer.

01:19.796 --> 01:22.632
We'll make spit wads
out of the programs.

01:23.516 --> 01:26.853
Take this. Follow her. Enjoy.

01:27.854 --> 01:30.356
Hey, honey, wait up.

01:37.113 --> 01:39.365
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:39.365 --> 01:42.368

01:42.368 --> 01:45.371
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:45.371 --> 01:48.374
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:48.374 --> 01:54.130
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:54.130 --> 01:56.916
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:56.916 --> 02:01.921
? Where everybody knows your name ?

02:01.921 --> 02:06.926
? And they're always glad you came ?

02:06.926 --> 02:08.928
? You want to be where you can see ?

02:08.928 --> 02:11.931
? Our troubles are all the same ?

02:11.931 --> 02:16.936
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

02:16.936 --> 02:19.939
? You want to go where people know ?

02:19.939 --> 02:21.941
? People are all the same ?

02:22.442 --> 02:26.946
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:43.763 --> 02:46.216
Greetings, everyone.

02:46.216 --> 02:48.218
CLIFF: Hey, Doctor.

02:48.218 --> 02:49.719
A beer, stout yeoman.

02:49.719 --> 02:51.104
Boy, you're in a good mood, Dr. Crane.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.472
And why shouldn't I be?

02:52.472 --> 02:53.473
Next week marks the anniversary

02:53.473 --> 02:55.475
of the day my beloved
Lilith and I first met.

02:55.475 --> 02:56.693
CLIFF: No kiddin'?

02:56.693 --> 02:57.977
Yeah. As a show of my affection,

02:57.977 --> 02:59.979
I bought her a Louis Quatorze armoire

02:59.979 --> 03:03.149
at a little antique shop
I saw on the Hill today.

03:03.149 --> 03:04.651
It set me back quite a penny.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.653
You know, I think when you're trying

03:06.653 --> 03:08.655
to express your affection for your mate,

03:08.655 --> 03:10.156
old wood says it best.

03:10.156 --> 03:12.125
What do I say?

03:13.126 --> 03:15.128
I was talking about the armoire.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.629
I never say that.

03:16.629 --> 03:19.132
I don't even know what an armoire is.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.635
It's a large chest.

03:22.635 --> 03:25.138
Well, hey, what woman
wouldn't want that?

03:25.138 --> 03:26.139
(laughing)

03:28.641 --> 03:30.643
So, uh, what's Lilith
getting you there, Doc?

03:30.643 --> 03:32.145
A set of golf clubs. Eh.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.146
Although she doesn't know it yet.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.514
Well, how can you be so sure?

03:34.514 --> 03:36.432
Well, I've left a lot of
clues around the house.

03:36.432 --> 03:37.934
You'd have to be an idiot
not to know what I want.

03:37.934 --> 03:39.435
And what's that, Dr. Crane?

03:43.072 --> 03:45.074
I-I haven't decided yet, Wood.

03:45.074 --> 03:46.576
Ah.

03:46.576 --> 03:49.078
So, uh...

03:49.078 --> 03:52.582
eh, Doc, I didn't know
you were a fellow linkster.

03:52.582 --> 03:55.084
You know, uh, someday, when
you feel you're good enough,

03:55.084 --> 03:58.588
I'll, uh, take you down
to my private country club

03:58.588 --> 04:00.957
for a little, uh, mano a mano.

04:00.957 --> 04:03.126
Eh, Normie, remember I took you down?

04:03.126 --> 04:04.594
I had a great time.

04:04.594 --> 04:07.096
I got, uh, three holes in one,
and I birdied the windmill.

04:09.966 --> 04:12.802
Hey, barkeep, I hear you pour

04:12.802 --> 04:14.220
a mean root beer in this saloon.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.722
Joyce?

04:15.722 --> 04:16.606
(laughs)

04:16.606 --> 04:19.024
Oh, my God. Joyce.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.976
Hi. Surprise. Oh. Ha.

04:20.976 --> 04:22.478
Boy, look at you.

04:22.478 --> 04:24.480
It's been ages, you know that? Yeah.

04:24.981 --> 04:25.982
Hey, everybody,

04:25.982 --> 04:28.952
this is Coach's niece, Joyce Pantusso.

04:28.952 --> 04:30.453
Nice to meet you.

04:30.453 --> 04:31.454
Look at you.

04:31.454 --> 04:32.956
It's so good to see you.

04:32.956 --> 04:36.459
Oh, we couldn't be more
thrilled to have you here.

04:36.459 --> 04:37.710
Who are you?

04:37.710 --> 04:39.045
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.797
Diane Chambers,

04:40.797 --> 04:42.131
Sam's fiancée. Oh.

04:42.131 --> 04:44.133
I'm sure he must've mentioned me.

04:44.133 --> 04:47.136
Oh, no.

04:47.136 --> 04:49.639
Well, it must have been an oversight.

04:49.639 --> 04:51.140
Anyway, it's so nice.

04:51.140 --> 04:52.508
We finally get to meet.

04:52.508 --> 04:53.760
We've all got goose bumps.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.263
Sit down here.

04:57.263 --> 04:58.264
Let me get you a soda or something.

04:58.765 --> 04:59.766
Oh, I'll get it. I'll get it.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.267
All right. Thanks, thanks.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.269
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming to Boston?

05:03.269 --> 05:05.772
Well, I wanted to surprise you.

05:05.772 --> 05:08.775
I start college at BU
in the spring quarter.

05:08.775 --> 05:10.159
Oh, my God.

05:10.159 --> 05:11.995
A Pantusso attending college. Yeah.

05:11.995 --> 05:15.999
A Pantusso pronouncing college.

05:15.999 --> 05:18.001
Yeah, yeah, my mom and
dad are really proud.

05:18.001 --> 05:19.002
Oh, I'll bet.

05:19.002 --> 05:21.504
Tell me, how-how-how's
everybody at Reedsport?

05:21.504 --> 05:23.506
Well, um, the family's fine.

05:23.506 --> 05:25.958
Would you believe the twins
are starting high school.

05:25.958 --> 05:26.959
No kidding.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.961
Who are the twins? (stammers)

05:30.963 --> 05:33.850
Mom's calligraphy business
is, uh, doing well. Yeah?

05:33.850 --> 05:36.602
Well, what about that
nutty wild man dad of yours?

05:36.602 --> 05:38.104
Oh, God, Coach's baby brother.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.105
I mean, you never knew

05:39.105 --> 05:40.273
what he was going to do next.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.608
Oh, he threw his back out vacuuming.

05:42.608 --> 05:43.976
What a nut, huh?

05:45.778 --> 05:47.447
(phone ringing)

05:47.447 --> 05:48.698
Oh, you know what? He asked me

05:48.698 --> 05:50.199
to give you something. There you go.

05:50.199 --> 05:51.200
Oh. WOODY: Sam.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.568
Beer distributor on the phone.

05:52.568 --> 05:53.953
Tell him I'll call back, please.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.204
NORM: Sammy, hey, hey.

05:55.204 --> 05:57.373
Where are your priorities? Come on.

06:00.326 --> 06:01.577
I'll be right back.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.715
So where is Reedsport?

06:06.215 --> 06:09.085
Oh, it's in Oregon, about
50 miles west of Eugene.

06:09.085 --> 06:11.387
Well! A left coaster, huh?

06:11.387 --> 06:12.138
Yeah.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.423
You know, uh,

06:13.423 --> 06:15.925
recent medical studies
have shown that, uh,

06:15.925 --> 06:18.428
time zone transference, aka jet lag,

06:18.428 --> 06:19.429
not only can be very upsetting

06:19.429 --> 06:20.930
to one's metabolism,

06:20.930 --> 06:23.933
but, uh, also directly
correlates to the, uh,

06:23.933 --> 06:25.935
loss of, uh, hair follicles.

06:26.936 --> 06:28.821
Are you a doctor?

06:28.821 --> 06:31.741
No, he's a floon.

06:32.742 --> 06:34.744
Who is that?

06:34.744 --> 06:37.246
Nobody knows.

06:40.249 --> 06:44.170
So, any last minute
fatherly pearls of wisdom?

06:44.170 --> 06:46.038
Read for yourself.

06:46.038 --> 06:47.373
Mmm.

06:47.373 --> 06:50.760
"Dear Sam, would you mind
keeping an eye on my Joyce?

06:50.760 --> 06:52.595
"Coach always trusted you.

06:52.595 --> 06:54.097
"She's my little girl,

06:54.097 --> 06:56.048
"and she's all alone in the big city.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.017
"If anything ever happened to her,

06:58.017 --> 07:00.520
"I'd go into the shed
and blow my brains out.

07:00.520 --> 07:04.023
Phyllis says hi."

07:05.024 --> 07:07.026
He writes a nice letter.

07:12.031 --> 07:15.034
Well, that certainly
puts the pressure on me.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.036
You?!

07:17.036 --> 07:18.538
Well, yes.

07:18.538 --> 07:20.540
What do you know about taking care of

07:20.540 --> 07:23.042
an 18-year-old in
the city of Boston?

07:23.042 --> 07:25.545
A young girl away from
home needs a big sister.

07:25.545 --> 07:28.047
Listen, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

07:28.047 --> 07:29.549
but she's my responsibility,

07:30.049 --> 07:32.051
and I am perfectly
capable of handling it.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.554
You know, kids are a lot different

07:34.554 --> 07:36.556
than when we were young.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.057
I mean, today they're smart.

07:38.057 --> 07:41.060
You gotta give 'em a lot of
room to make their own mistakes.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.929
Yeah, so I hear you're
from out of town. Yeah.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.264
Hey, hey, hey, what-what're
you doing there?

07:45.264 --> 07:48.768
I'm just making some
polite conversation.

07:48.768 --> 07:49.769
Yeah, well, buddy, this is a bar.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.771
You want to make polite conversation,

07:51.771 --> 07:52.772
you take it outside.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.274
Whatever you say.

07:55.274 --> 07:56.776
SAM: Do you believe that?

07:56.776 --> 07:57.777
Sam, that wasn't necessary.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.278
I'm not a little girl.

07:59.278 --> 08:00.780
Forget about it. Come on. Come on.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.282
Get up here and sit up on
my bar here and, uh, tell me.

08:03.282 --> 08:04.283
Well, are you all, uh,

08:04.283 --> 08:05.785
you all checked in at college, huh?

08:05.785 --> 08:07.286
Well, uh, not really.

08:07.286 --> 08:09.288
The... my dorm is
having plumbing troubles,

08:09.288 --> 08:12.175
and I have no place to stay.

08:12.175 --> 08:13.626
Well, that's not a problem.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.127
You can stay with me.

08:15.127 --> 08:16.546
I just have to pick up a few things.

08:17.046 --> 08:19.048
A bottle of juice, a loaf of bread.

08:19.048 --> 08:21.050
A door for the bathroom.

08:23.469 --> 08:25.972
My, God, yeah.

08:25.972 --> 08:29.358
Joyce, the only logical place
for you to stay is with me.

08:29.358 --> 08:31.310
Oh.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.312
Coach was like a father to me.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.198
Well, I mean, if it's
no problem. Why not?

08:35.198 --> 08:36.065
None at all.

08:36.065 --> 08:37.066
We'll have fun.

08:37.066 --> 08:39.068
It'll be one long slumber party.

08:39.068 --> 08:40.318
Oh, goody.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.155
Can I come over and bring
my Frankie Avalon records?

08:44.657 --> 08:46.659
I have dibs on cutting off her hair

08:46.659 --> 08:48.661
when she goes to sleep.

08:49.662 --> 08:52.164
Yeah, and if we can get
our hands on a laser,

08:52.164 --> 08:53.549
we'll try cutting Carla's.

08:53.549 --> 08:55.334
Listen, uh,

08:55.334 --> 08:58.170
it'll be a little while
before I can get off.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.555
You know what?

08:59.555 --> 09:01.340
Since this is your first day in Boston,

09:01.340 --> 09:03.226
I bet you'd love to
see some of the sights.

09:03.226 --> 09:04.510
Well, yes, I would.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.012
Good. Yeah, uh,

09:06.012 --> 09:07.013
it's a great idea,

09:07.013 --> 09:08.898
but I can't get out of the bar today.

09:08.898 --> 09:10.733
Oh, Sammy, she can come on
my route with me, if you want.

09:10.733 --> 09:12.101
No, no. Uh...

09:12.101 --> 09:14.070
DIANE: Sam?

09:14.070 --> 09:15.571
Sam... What?

09:15.571 --> 09:17.573
No problem. We'll, uh, we'll just

09:17.573 --> 09:19.942
find someone else to
show her the sights.

09:19.942 --> 09:21.193
All right.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.194
Someone who's

09:22.194 --> 09:23.696
enthusiastic.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.198
Someone who's non threatening.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.617
That's good. That's good.

09:28.117 --> 09:29.619
Somebody, uh, trustworthy.

09:29.619 --> 09:31.120
Somebody, uh, innocent. Right.

09:31.621 --> 09:33.623
Hey, Sam, you remember that little bird

09:33.623 --> 09:34.624
whose wing I mended?

09:35.124 --> 09:38.628
Well, this morning, I was...

09:38.628 --> 09:39.629
Hey, do you mind?

09:39.629 --> 09:40.630
I'm trying to think here, Woody.

09:41.130 --> 09:45.134
Sam...

09:45.134 --> 09:47.637
Oh, yeah, right.

09:47.637 --> 09:49.639
Well, hey, do you
mind? I'll handle this.

09:49.639 --> 09:52.141
Woody, come here for
a second here, will ya?

09:52.141 --> 09:54.644
You know, I've been thinking
long and hard about this, Woody.

09:54.644 --> 09:57.146
Look, there's, uh, somebody
I want you to meet here.

09:57.647 --> 09:58.648
Come here.

09:58.648 --> 10:01.033
Joyce, Woody. Hi.

10:01.033 --> 10:01.901
Wow, what a coincidence.

10:01.901 --> 10:04.153
My first name is Woody.

10:09.292 --> 10:11.794
How would you like to take
the rest of the day off

10:11.794 --> 10:13.296
and show, uh, Joyce around the town?

10:13.296 --> 10:14.797
Oh, gee, I'd love to.

10:14.797 --> 10:16.799
Well, good. Take off. Go on.

10:16.799 --> 10:18.301
Okay, great.

10:18.301 --> 10:21.304
Uh, can we see Old Ironsides first?

10:21.304 --> 10:25.808
Well, I don't know if
Raymond Burr lives in Boston.

10:34.183 --> 10:35.601
Well, I'm off.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.605
Fore!

10:39.605 --> 10:41.107
Oh, you get those clubs yet, Fras?

10:41.107 --> 10:43.025
No, but it's just a matter of time.

10:43.025 --> 10:45.528
See, I placed brochures
strategically about the house

10:45.528 --> 10:46.529
for Lilith to notice.

10:46.529 --> 10:48.030
One nestled under her pillow.

10:48.030 --> 10:49.031
One by the wine rack.

10:49.031 --> 10:50.950
One next to the whip locker.

10:56.422 --> 10:57.423
Hey, Sammy, is Woody

10:57.423 --> 10:58.924
out with Joyce again today?

10:58.924 --> 11:01.794
Yeah. That makes every day this week.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.462
They are so cute together.

11:03.462 --> 11:04.797
You know where he's taking her now?

11:04.797 --> 11:06.298
They're going out for ice cream,

11:06.298 --> 11:07.800
and then they're going roller skating.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.301
Oh, those kiddleys, huh?

11:09.301 --> 11:11.804
Well, doesn't that just
remind you of your youth?

11:11.804 --> 11:12.688
Not one damn bit.

11:13.189 --> 11:14.190
That's why I feel good about it.

11:15.474 --> 11:16.859
You know,

11:16.859 --> 11:18.811
I just think it's a stroke of genius

11:18.811 --> 11:20.813
that I had Woody squire
Joyce around town.

11:20.813 --> 11:23.315
I mean, she's safe, and
I have my peace of mind.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.317
Personally, I'm a little
worried about Joyce.

11:25.317 --> 11:27.319
She's been seeing an awful lot of Woody.

11:27.319 --> 11:28.821
So what?

11:28.821 --> 11:31.574
Do you know what time
she got in last night?

11:31.574 --> 11:34.293
2:30.

11:34.293 --> 11:35.661
Who knows what they were up to?

11:35.661 --> 11:37.163
(chuckling): Oh, come on.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.664
We're talking about Woody.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.167
I mean, the guy is a, is
a walking Disney character

11:41.167 --> 11:42.551
without the fur.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.838
I think you should talk to them.

11:45.838 --> 11:47.840
There's nothing to talk about.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.225
Hey, I'll talk to her.

11:49.225 --> 11:50.176
No, you won't. Why not?

11:50.176 --> 11:52.261
Because you don't know what the hell

11:52.261 --> 11:53.646
you're talking about.

11:53.646 --> 11:54.647
All right, fine.

11:55.147 --> 11:57.400
I don't know what the
hell I'm talking about.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.235
And that's the last you'll hear from me.

11:59.235 --> 12:00.603
Thank you.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.322
Hey, so there you are.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.074
What kind of ice cream did you get?

12:05.074 --> 12:06.108
Tutti-frutti.

12:06.108 --> 12:08.994
Ha-ha! Tutti-frutti.
Did you hear that?

12:08.994 --> 12:09.995
Yeah, you better be careful

12:09.995 --> 12:11.997
'cause that can lead
to the hard stuff--

12:11.997 --> 12:13.365
double chocolate.

12:15.501 --> 12:19.171
So, uh, is he treating you well?

12:19.171 --> 12:20.589
Yeah, yeah, he sure is.

12:20.589 --> 12:22.091
You know, I think he is

12:22.091 --> 12:24.460
the sweetest person I've ever met.

12:24.460 --> 12:25.594
(quietly): Me, too.

12:25.594 --> 12:27.880
You know, Sam, I am having the best time

12:27.880 --> 12:31.383
I've ever had in my life, and
I have you to thank for it.

12:32.384 --> 12:33.769
Well,

12:33.769 --> 12:36.939
if you're happy, we're happy.

12:36.939 --> 12:38.224
If that makes you happy,

12:38.224 --> 12:40.226
you're going to do
cartwheels when you hear this.

12:40.226 --> 12:42.611
Joyce and I are engaged.

12:53.756 --> 12:55.541
NORM: Hey, uh, Sam?

12:55.541 --> 12:57.960
Are you, are you okay?

12:57.960 --> 13:00.296
Yeah, why?

13:00.296 --> 13:03.098
You're filling your shoes with beer.

13:06.802 --> 13:08.604
Will this be enough for you?

13:10.473 --> 13:11.857
Could you two sit down over at

13:11.857 --> 13:13.359
the table there, please?

13:13.359 --> 13:14.727
I'll be right with you.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.529
Ah-ah-ah.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.030
I'll handle this.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.032
Just butt out.

13:22.535 --> 13:26.038
Well... thank you.

13:26.038 --> 13:27.039
You're welcome.

13:27.039 --> 13:30.042
So...you're engaged.

13:30.042 --> 13:32.411
Yeah, yeah, and,

13:32.411 --> 13:34.713
and we wanted you to be the
first one to know about it

13:34.713 --> 13:36.215
since you were the one
who put us together.

13:36.215 --> 13:39.218
Well, thank you.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.720
Why are you doing this to me?

13:43.589 --> 13:45.591
Well, Sam, we thought
this would make you happy.

13:45.591 --> 13:51.096
Well, I am, in a, a...
sad and disappointed way.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.984
Well, listen, I know it sounds crazy.

13:54.984 --> 13:56.936
We've only known each other a few days,

13:56.936 --> 13:58.320
but it seems like...

13:58.320 --> 14:00.739
several.

14:02.575 --> 14:06.529
Listen, listen, you
guys, listen, listen.

14:06.529 --> 14:09.532
I, I was in your shoes once.

14:09.532 --> 14:11.033
I mean, I was young.

14:11.033 --> 14:14.286
I-I, I had a whirlwind
romance and I got married

14:14.286 --> 14:17.089
and it turned out to be a disaster.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.091
I don't want this to happen to you now.

14:19.091 --> 14:20.009
I mean, look at,

14:20.009 --> 14:21.427
look at Diane and me.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.679
We waited five years to get married,

14:23.679 --> 14:25.931
and if it were up to me,
we'd wait another five.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.767
I'm just trying to make a point.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.019
Do you mind?

14:30.019 --> 14:31.804
The point is, the point is

14:32.304 --> 14:33.272
that you got to, you got to,

14:33.272 --> 14:35.274
you got to get to know each other better

14:35.274 --> 14:37.443
if you're going to take
a big step like this.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.728
You got to get past this,
this early infatuation

14:39.728 --> 14:41.230
and get to the point

14:41.230 --> 14:42.731
where you're sick and
tired of each other.

14:42.731 --> 14:44.233
Then you're ready for marriage.

14:46.151 --> 14:49.154
Sam, we're never going
to be sick of each other.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.156
SAM: You know, there, there are hundreds

14:51.156 --> 14:52.658
of good, solid reasons

14:53.158 --> 14:55.411
why you two should not get married.

14:55.411 --> 14:57.746
Like?

14:57.746 --> 14:59.131
Like...

14:59.131 --> 15:02.501
like I forbid you to, young lady.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.005
Wait, you can't forbid me.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.006
You're not my father.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.007
(chuckles)

15:08.007 --> 15:09.508
All right, all right.

15:09.508 --> 15:12.011
Woody, I forbid you to marry Joyce.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.263
Sam, you're only my boss.

15:14.263 --> 15:16.098
Damn it, I, I'm going to forbid

15:16.098 --> 15:17.983
somebody something, I'll tell you.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.234
Norm, I-I forbid you

15:19.234 --> 15:20.486
to leave that stool.

15:20.486 --> 15:23.322
Sorry, Sam, uh, nature calls.

15:23.322 --> 15:24.823
SAM: Hey, hey, you,

15:24.823 --> 15:25.741
whoa, whoa.

15:25.741 --> 15:26.992
You go and you're cut off.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.577
Whatever you say, Pop.

15:29.912 --> 15:32.781
SAM: Let's get down to

15:32.781 --> 15:33.666
brass tacks here.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.167
How much do you want?

15:35.167 --> 15:36.669
Okay, I'm not a, you know,

15:36.669 --> 15:37.670
I'm not a rich guy, but I'm comfortable,

15:37.670 --> 15:40.089
so let's stop jerking old Sammy around,

15:40.089 --> 15:42.591
and name your price.

15:42.591 --> 15:43.592
Come on.

15:43.592 --> 15:45.094
We don't want anything.

15:45.094 --> 15:46.095
We just want to be together.

15:46.095 --> 15:47.596
SAM: Oh, no, don't do...

15:47.596 --> 15:49.598
Just get into my office, will you?

15:49.598 --> 15:51.100
Come on, both of you.

15:51.100 --> 15:52.468
I've tried to talk to you

15:52.468 --> 15:53.469
on an emotional level,

15:53.469 --> 15:55.354
a logical level and
in an economic level.

15:55.354 --> 15:58.357
Now we're just going to have
to raise this whole discussion

15:58.357 --> 15:59.608
up to a higher plane.

16:00.943 --> 16:03.946
Have pity on me.

16:03.946 --> 16:06.315
Oh, please don't do this to me, please.

16:06.315 --> 16:07.783
I-I haven't had an easy life.

16:07.783 --> 16:10.285
This is going to hurt me,
and I-I don't want to be hurt.

16:10.285 --> 16:11.654
I mean, I-I don't like pain.

16:11.654 --> 16:13.122
And think about your parents.

16:13.122 --> 16:13.989
They hate pain, too.

16:13.989 --> 16:16.158
Not, not as much as me, but pretty much.

16:16.158 --> 16:18.077
Oh, come on, this news'll
kill them, you guys.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.461
It'll kill me, too.

16:19.461 --> 16:20.579
I-I... please don't,

16:20.579 --> 16:22.915
please, come on, don't do this to me!

16:22.915 --> 16:24.416
Don't make me beg.

16:26.418 --> 16:27.670
Oh...

16:27.670 --> 16:31.473
Gee, Sam, you feel pretty
strongly about this?

16:31.473 --> 16:33.342
SAM: Yeah.

16:33.342 --> 16:34.810
Yeah.

16:34.810 --> 16:36.178
Well, maybe he's right, Woody.

16:36.178 --> 16:38.564
Maybe we could get to
know each other better.

16:38.564 --> 16:39.815
Really?

16:39.815 --> 16:41.016
It couldn't hurt.

16:41.016 --> 16:43.268
Oh, oh, oh, bless you.

16:43.268 --> 16:44.653
Bless you, kids.

16:44.653 --> 16:47.156
Oh, you, you're the greatest.

16:47.156 --> 16:48.657
Hang in there, buddy.

16:48.657 --> 16:50.159
Oh, oh, thanks, Wood.

16:56.915 --> 17:00.419
Oh... heh-heh, they bought it.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.921
(chortles)

17:05.290 --> 17:06.258
See you later, Sam.

17:06.258 --> 17:07.960
Yeah, yeah. Hey, listen, you know,

17:07.960 --> 17:09.762
what you said in there
made a lot of sense.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.262
I think you may have stopped us

17:11.262 --> 17:12.513
from making a pretty big mistake.

17:12.513 --> 17:13.715
JOYCE: Yes, thank you.

17:13.715 --> 17:15.099
Yeah, my pleasure.

17:17.519 --> 17:22.023
Well, what else can I do
around here that I'm great at?

17:25.527 --> 17:28.530
Nauseate us?

17:28.530 --> 17:30.532
Maybe some other time.

17:37.573 --> 17:38.574
NORM: Hey, Fras,

17:38.574 --> 17:40.075
thought you'd be out
on the links by now.

17:40.576 --> 17:42.077
It would be exceedingly difficult

17:42.578 --> 17:43.579
to tee off with this.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.082
What's, uh, what's that, Fras?

17:47.082 --> 17:50.085
This is my extra
special gift from Lilith.

17:50.085 --> 17:51.086
It's a tie.

17:51.086 --> 17:52.588
Yes, and I hate it.

17:52.588 --> 17:54.089
It's ugly.

17:56.091 --> 17:57.092
It's just a tie.

17:57.593 --> 17:58.594
An ordinary gray tie.

17:58.594 --> 18:00.095
I wanted golf clubs!

18:00.095 --> 18:01.096
It's not special!

18:01.096 --> 18:02.598
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!

18:06.101 --> 18:09.104
Glad she didn't give him a puppy.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.328
Oh, come, come on, come on.

18:16.328 --> 18:19.331
We're not even married yet.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.332
Oh, Sam.

18:20.332 --> 18:21.834
It's never too early

18:21.834 --> 18:23.836
to start thinking about
names for our children.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.338
It-It is if you're thinking
about the name Emile.

18:28.707 --> 18:31.043
What's wrong with Emile?

18:31.043 --> 18:32.544
Emile is something you eat.

18:32.544 --> 18:34.546
It's not something you name your kid.

18:36.298 --> 18:39.468
Why-Why don't you just
name him Socrates, after me?

18:40.435 --> 18:42.304
SAM: Ah!

18:42.304 --> 18:45.724
you two kids still basking
in the glow of my wisdom?

18:45.724 --> 18:46.225
We sure are.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.726
We thought about what you said,

18:47.726 --> 18:49.728
and we decided it was the best advice

18:49.728 --> 18:51.980
anyone had ever given us in our lives.

18:51.980 --> 18:53.782
You hear that, Diane?

18:53.782 --> 18:56.151
That's why we've decided
to call off the wedding

18:56.151 --> 18:57.402
and move in together.

19:02.574 --> 19:04.877
Hear that, Socrates?

19:07.880 --> 19:09.882
Would you two kids go into my office

19:09.882 --> 19:11.383
and, and wait for a second?

19:11.383 --> 19:12.751
Sure, Sam.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.636
Thank you.

19:16.138 --> 19:17.639
You know something?

19:17.639 --> 19:19.641
I could handle this, too,

19:19.641 --> 19:21.393
if I wanted to.

19:21.393 --> 19:24.730
But I think I'm going to
be a good sport about this

19:24.730 --> 19:27.099
and, uh, let you take a crack at it.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.400
So, what you're saying

19:28.400 --> 19:30.769
is that you screwed up miserably,

19:30.769 --> 19:33.655
and now you want me to bail you out.

19:33.655 --> 19:34.656
No! Of course not.

19:35.157 --> 19:36.158
Absolutely not.

19:36.158 --> 19:38.577
Well, yes. Yes.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.829
Well, Sam, you don't deserve it,

19:40.829 --> 19:43.916
but I'll give it a shot.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.250
Stand aside, Sam.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.753
You're about to see
26 units of psychology

19:47.753 --> 19:49.755
fly into action.

19:49.755 --> 19:53.258
So, you're going to live together.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.760
Why? Talk to me.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.128
Well, Sam said

19:56.128 --> 19:58.046
we should get to know each other better

19:58.046 --> 20:00.549
before we got married,
and, and we thought

20:00.549 --> 20:02.050
this might be the best way.

20:02.050 --> 20:04.436
Mm-hmm.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.688
But I think you've forgotten something.

20:06.688 --> 20:10.392
The reason Joyce came to
Boston in the first place.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.645
College.

20:15.564 --> 20:17.065
That was my mom's idea.

20:17.065 --> 20:19.067
I decided I'm not going to college.

20:23.038 --> 20:25.707
Not... not going to college?

20:25.707 --> 20:27.075
No.

20:27.075 --> 20:29.578
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:29.578 --> 20:31.580
Oh, no, no.

20:31.580 --> 20:33.081
Oh, you must listen to me.

20:33.081 --> 20:35.584
You... You have your
whole life ahead of you.

20:35.584 --> 20:37.085
You can't throw it away like this.

20:37.085 --> 20:38.470
If you don't go to college,

20:38.470 --> 20:40.255
you can't earn a living.

20:40.255 --> 20:42.641
And, and without a job, what will you do

20:42.641 --> 20:46.428
when he leaves you
with a litter of kids...

20:46.428 --> 20:48.397
and, and you have to sell them,

20:48.397 --> 20:50.265
one after another,

20:50.265 --> 20:54.019
just to put food on your
pathetic little table?

20:54.019 --> 20:58.023
And, in the end, you'll
be left with nothing.

20:58.023 --> 21:01.994
Nothing but worn-out
hips and sagging breasts.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.782
Is that really what you want?

21:06.782 --> 21:08.583
Well, I can't speak for Joyce,

21:08.583 --> 21:10.419
but I could do without that.

21:19.461 --> 21:22.264
So, tell me

21:22.264 --> 21:26.218
that you'll give up this insane
idea of shacking up together

21:26.218 --> 21:29.721
and concentrate on your college career.

21:29.721 --> 21:32.607
Well, um...

21:32.607 --> 21:35.110
I guess I could move into the dorm

21:35.110 --> 21:36.611
and try a couple classes.

21:36.611 --> 21:37.479
Yes.

21:37.479 --> 21:38.981
Yeah. And we could still date

21:38.981 --> 21:40.732
and see each other, couldn't we?

21:40.732 --> 21:43.035
Sure, oh, sure, sure. Dating's good.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.037
Dating's fine. Yeah.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.538
Sure, I like that idea.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.540
Well, thanks, Miss Chambers.

21:48.540 --> 21:49.541
Okay.

21:49.541 --> 21:50.542
Yes, thank you.

21:50.542 --> 21:51.410
Aw...

21:51.410 --> 21:52.828
Thank you.

22:00.836 --> 22:02.337
How'd it go?

22:02.337 --> 22:03.722
Oh, well,

22:03.722 --> 22:05.140
suffice it to say,

22:05.140 --> 22:08.643
the Chambers expertise worked its magic.

22:08.643 --> 22:10.645
You begged, huh?

22:10.645 --> 22:14.016
How do you know?

22:14.016 --> 22:15.517
Your nylons are all baggy there.

22:19.771 --> 22:21.073
How about you?

22:21.073 --> 22:22.324
I don't wear nylons.

22:23.658 --> 22:26.661
I mean, how did you talk
them out of getting married?

22:26.661 --> 22:29.164
Me?

22:29.164 --> 22:32.167
I begged like a dog for a bone.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.669
Oh, Sam...

22:34.669 --> 22:36.588
Mm.

22:36.588 --> 22:38.623
Well, how can we avoid
having this problem

22:38.623 --> 22:41.126
with our own children?

22:41.626 --> 22:44.596
Never have sex again.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.306
I think it's worth it.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.308
Me, too.

22:58.276 --> 22:59.778
Absolutely.

22:59.778 --> 23:00.779
Yeah, yeah...

23:00.779 --> 23:01.780
It's worth it.

23:01.780 --> 23:02.781
Absolutely.

23:08.203 --> 23:09.204
Well, may...

23:09.204 --> 23:10.705
maybe just...
