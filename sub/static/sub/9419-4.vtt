06:23.684 --> 06:25.283
It's more of a civil matter.

06:25.285 --> 06:26.151
I would pretty much have to take

06:26.153 --> 06:27.452
Him to court, and I'm like,

06:27.454 --> 06:28.620
"I don't have the time, nor do

06:28.622 --> 06:29.821
I have the money."

06:29.823 --> 06:31.022
So I just want to get down to

06:31.024 --> 06:32.457
The bottom of it.

06:32.459 --> 06:33.492
>> and you have all the

06:33.494 --> 06:34.326
Correspondence?

06:34.328 --> 06:35.127
>> yes, I do.

06:35.129 --> 06:35.861
>> let's check it out.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.130
>> yeah.

06:38.132 --> 06:39.865
>> in the end of 2012, first

06:39.867 --> 06:40.866
Found out about kidd.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.033
That's when I found out he had

06:42.035 --> 06:43.568
Some beats on soundcloud.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.503
I listened to him.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.505
I figured out that he was

06:46.507 --> 06:47.472
Talented.

06:47.474 --> 06:48.707
I reached out to him on twitter,

06:48.709 --> 06:49.708
D.M.'d him.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.710
That goes on for weeks, months.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.112
I'm telling you, me and this boy

06:54.114 --> 06:55.547
Were in contact.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.782
>> this is serious contact.

06:56.784 --> 06:57.482
>> yeah.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.183
>> so you do have a number for

06:58.185 --> 06:59.251
Him.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.886
>> 202 is...

07:00.888 --> 07:02.154
>> d.C.

07:02.156 --> 07:02.921
>> that's probably where this

07:02.923 --> 07:04.122
Guy is.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.558
>> so then I was contacted by

07:06.560 --> 07:08.560
His comanager, miguel, about

07:08.562 --> 07:09.528
Being invited to his birthday

07:09.530 --> 07:10.896
Party and the whole celebrity

07:10.898 --> 07:12.664
Guest list.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.366
>> the guests include

07:14.368 --> 07:16.835
Robin thicke, pharrell,

07:16.837 --> 07:18.403
Kanye west, and jaden smith.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.805
>> I was excited.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.606
He says, "I was just, you know,

07:21.608 --> 07:22.774
Reaching out to you to see if

07:22.776 --> 07:23.842
You could help me with some

07:23.844 --> 07:24.876
Things as far as kidd's

07:24.878 --> 07:25.777
Concerned."

07:25.779 --> 07:29.080
So I was pretty much the contact

07:29.082 --> 07:31.917
Person to set up everything for

07:31.919 --> 07:33.952
Kidd cole for what he was going

07:33.954 --> 07:36.688
To be doing in the d.C. Area.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.490
This went on for two weeks.

07:38.492 --> 07:41.126
I booked appearances for him at

07:41.128 --> 07:42.227
A high school.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.229
I would have the lead security

07:44.231 --> 07:45.730
Guy making sure there was an

07:45.732 --> 07:47.232
Entrance that he can come in

07:47.234 --> 07:48.834
And speak to the kids.

07:48.836 --> 07:49.501
>> okay.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.302
>> they would have question and

07:50.304 --> 07:51.937
Answer, and it's like everything

07:51.939 --> 07:53.505
That I'm doing is pretty much a

07:53.507 --> 07:54.806
Test as far as...

07:54.808 --> 07:55.674
>> sure.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.375
>> how I'm going to perform if

07:57.377 --> 07:58.877
I'm with the label.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.446
But it was a fiasco with him.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.882
It was always, "nobody loves me.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.183
Everybody just wants to be with

08:05.185 --> 08:07.018
Me because I have money.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.453
I'll be better off dead."

08:08.455 --> 08:10.255
>> he got you hooked emotionally

08:10.257 --> 08:11.389
And, like, professionally.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.157
>> psychologically,

08:12.159 --> 08:12.824
Professionally.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.492
>> yeah.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.426
>> he always threatened, "well,

08:14.428 --> 08:16.261
I'm going to call kanye.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.095
People going to get fired."

08:17.097 --> 08:17.963
>> who threatened?

08:17.965 --> 08:21.433
>> kidd.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.034
I'm thinking I'm going to be,

08:23.036 --> 08:24.536
You know, charged with something

08:24.538 --> 08:26.338
Because everything is done by

08:26.340 --> 08:27.339
Me.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.640
>> this is what scares me.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.208
You hired the driver.

08:30.210 --> 08:30.976
>> yes.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.477
>> you hired the security guy.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.011
They could easily think that you

08:34.014 --> 08:36.313
Were the one executing the scam.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.448
>> I'm the pawn in all this.

08:37.451 --> 08:38.482
>> yeah.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.118
So how did this end?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.721
>> kidd had given the driver the

08:42.722 --> 08:43.922
Contract.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.324
He calls me saying, "I looked at

08:46.326 --> 08:47.425
The contract.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.560
There was no contact

08:48.562 --> 08:49.227
Information.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.262
There's no address,

08:50.264 --> 08:51.196
No nothing."

08:51.198 --> 08:52.797
He said it's all a fake.

08:52.799 --> 08:53.965
I'm like, "oh, my god, like, how

08:53.967 --> 08:54.966
Are these people going to be

08:54.968 --> 08:55.634
Paid?"

08:55.636 --> 08:56.301
>> right.

08:56.303 --> 08:56.968
>> because when I saw that

08:56.970 --> 08:58.904
Invoice, I almost hit the floor.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.071
These are people who have

09:00.073 --> 09:01.973
Families, who--who have rent to

09:01.975 --> 09:04.042
Pay, like, I mean, and they were

09:04.044 --> 09:05.610
Banking on getting paid from

09:05.612 --> 09:07.012
This job.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.146
>> you must have contacted

09:08.148 --> 09:09.581
Miguel and said, "hey, what's

09:09.583 --> 09:10.415
Going on?"

09:10.417 --> 09:11.650
You have his number.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.118
>> yes, and he never responded.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.586
>> he kind of left you...

09:14.588 --> 09:15.820
>> to fend for myself.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.088
It's like he disappeared--

09:17.090 --> 09:19.057
No texts, no nothing.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.458
He just got ghost.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.459
>> and where is kidd cole?

09:21.461 --> 09:23.328
>> he contacted me just this

09:23.330 --> 09:24.963
Month asking me for my credit

09:24.965 --> 09:27.165
Card information because he had

09:27.167 --> 09:29.167
A press conference to do with

09:29.169 --> 09:31.703
Cnn and the transportation

09:31.705 --> 09:33.805
Company needed a valid credit

09:33.807 --> 09:35.974
Card on file because his credit

09:35.976 --> 09:37.142
Card declined.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.811
Like, who does that?

09:39.813 --> 09:41.279
Oh, god.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.949
I'm in trouble.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.951
I want to find out what's going

09:45.953 --> 09:48.053
On, who he is, why is he doing

09:48.055 --> 09:49.220
This, 'cause this is not how

09:49.222 --> 09:51.056
You treat somebody.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.190
>> all right, so put it all in

09:52.192 --> 09:53.358
An email and give us everything

09:53.360 --> 09:54.025
You have.

09:54.027 --> 09:54.693

09:54.695 --> 09:56.094

09:56.096 --> 09:56.761

09:56.763 --> 09:57.429

09:57.431 --> 09:58.096
Person.

09:58.098 --> 09:58.763
>> that's right.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.431
>> all right?

09:59.433 --> 10:00.231
>> okay, bye.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.734
>> bye.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.602
>> the whole story is

10:03.604 --> 10:04.336
Complicated.

10:04.338 --> 10:05.203
There's lots of parts and

10:05.205 --> 10:06.504
Players and monies.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.906

10:11.712 --> 10:12.444
Looking into that, I think we

10:12.446 --> 10:13.244
Just need to determine if

10:13.246 --> 10:15.647
Kidd cole is real.

10:15.649 --> 10:22.821
>> give me the camera.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.255
>> I'll shoot you.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.390
>> all right.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.558
I will gladly lead this

10:26.560 --> 10:29.227
Investigation.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.029
For two weeks, lucille was

Scammed by this guy, kidd cole.

Really tell who this is, and

There's a song featuring

19:35.008 --> 19:36.274
<i>And I said, "yeah."</i>

19:36.276 --> 19:37.308
<i>And we went and googled this</i>

19:37.310 --> 19:38.409
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

19:38.411 --> 19:40.011
<i>He had, like, events in d.C.</i>

19:40.013 --> 19:42.113
<i>Where he was with kanye west and</i>

19:42.115 --> 19:44.182
<i>Jaden smith.</i>

19:44.184 --> 19:45.983
<i>So the next day we picked</i>

19:45.985 --> 19:47.451
<i>Mr. Cole up.</i>

19:47.453 --> 19:48.786
<i>After that, we went to this</i>

19:48.788 --> 19:50.688
<i>Place to eat and found out that</i>

19:50.690 --> 19:52.190
<i>He didn't have enough money to</i>

19:52.192 --> 19:53.691
<i>Pay the bill.</i>

19:53.693 --> 19:54.959
<i>He texted us the next day, said</i>

19:54.961 --> 19:56.894
<i>That kidd cole was robbed the</i>

19:56.896 --> 19:59.463
<i>Night before, of his wallet and</i>

19:59.465 --> 20:00.698
<i>Of $800.</i>

20:00.700 --> 20:01.966
<i>>> yeah, he told me a similar</i>

20:01.968 --> 20:03.701
<i>Story about how somebody robbed</i>

20:03.703 --> 20:04.368
<i>Him.</i>

20:04.370 --> 20:05.036
<i>>> yeah.</i>

20:05.038 --> 20:06.137
<i>>> and so that was one of the</i>

20:06.139 --> 20:07.438
<i>Reasons why he wanted to have a</i>

20:07.440 --> 20:08.873
<i>Whole bunch of security with</i>

20:08.875 --> 20:09.740
<i>Him, because he had got robbed.</i>

20:09.742 --> 20:10.474
<i>>> oh, my gosh.</i>

20:10.476 --> 20:12.443
<i>I took him to h&m, where he</i>

20:12.445 --> 20:14.478
<i>Wanted me to call and ask for</i>

20:14.480 --> 20:16.847
<i>Security to come outside and</i>

20:16.849 --> 20:18.983
<i>Meet him so he can go shopping.</i>

20:18.985 --> 20:20.017
<i>These gentlemen were standing on</i>

20:20.019 --> 20:22.386
<i>The corner like it was obama.</i>

20:22.388 --> 20:23.621
<i>Then I guess he started trusting</i>

20:23.623 --> 20:25.156
<i>Me, and then I always dropped</i>

20:25.158 --> 20:27.058
<i>Him off at home.</i>

20:27.060 --> 20:28.025
<i>That's the house I went in and</i>

20:28.027 --> 20:29.527
<i>Visited the grandmother.</i>

20:29.529 --> 20:30.294
<i>>> how'd you end up getting</i>

20:30.296 --> 20:31.429
<i>Inside the house?</i>

20:31.431 --> 20:33.197
<i>>> oh, you don't know me, sir.</i>

20:33.199 --> 20:34.599
<i>I went the next day, and</i>

20:34.601 --> 20:36.100
<i>I knocked on the door and said,</i>

20:36.102 --> 20:37.668
<i>"is mr. Jerez coleman there?"</i>

20:37.670 --> 20:38.469
<i>She's like, "who?"</i>

20:38.471 --> 20:39.904
<i>I said, "kidd cole."</i>

20:39.906 --> 20:41.672
<i>And she opened the door.</i>

20:41.674 --> 20:42.707
<i>And she said, "well, no, he's</i>

20:42.709 --> 20:45.676
<i>Not here, but his mother is."</i>

20:45.678 --> 20:47.111
<i>The young lady never came down</i>

20:47.113 --> 20:49.247
<i>To even approach me to see why</i>

20:49.249 --> 20:50.681
<i>I was there about her son.</i>

20:50.683 --> 20:51.782
<i>And as I was leaving, the</i>

20:51.784 --> 20:53.718
<i>Grandma was like, "loretta,</i>

20:53.720 --> 20:54.585
<i>They've been staying with me for</i>

20:54.587 --> 20:55.453

20:55.455 --> 20:57.555
<i>I think they're homeless."</i>

20:57.557 --> 20:59.457
<i>And I was like, "I got him."</i>

20:59.459 --> 21:00.391
<i>And that's all I said, and</i>

21:00.393 --> 21:01.325
<i>I walked out.</i>

21:01.327 --> 21:02.326
<i>>> wow.</i>

21:02.328 --> 21:03.227
<i>>> I have a friend who's a</i>

<i>>> she searched jerez coleman</i>

21:12.138 --> 21:13.137
<i>To court.</i>

21:13.139 --> 21:15.406
<i>So he's going to get caught.</i>

21:15.408 --> 21:16.240
<i>>> how much money did you</i>

33:05.250 --> 33:06.049
<i>>> I don't even know.</i>

33:06.051 --> 33:08.318
<i>Like, I'm trying to--for some</i>

33:08.320 --> 33:09.886
<i>Reason, it--the track isn't</i>

33:09.888 --> 33:12.656
<i>Trying to record.</i>

33:12.658 --> 33:15.759
<i>What is going on here?</i>

33:15.761 --> 33:37.314
<i>[door creaks]</i>

33:37.316 --> 33:38.715
<i>>> all right, so they just</i>

33:38.717 --> 33:40.417
<i>Pretty much have us in a really,</i>

33:40.419 --> 33:42.719
<i>Really awkward position.</i>

33:42.721 --> 33:44.221
<i>Nev, like, really, really wants</i>

33:44.223 --> 33:46.556
<i>To record, and all I can do is</i>

33:46.558 --> 33:49.860
<i>Just play the beat.</i>

33:49.862 --> 33:50.961
<i>>> how's it going?</i>

33:50.963 --> 33:51.695
<i>>> good.</i>

33:51.697 --> 33:52.929
<i>>> lot of pressure with all the</i>

33:52.931 --> 33:53.630
<i>Cameras and stuff.</i>

33:53.632 --> 33:55.599
<i>>> yeah.</i>

33:55.601 --> 33:56.500
<i>No.</i>

33:56.502 --> 33:57.601
<i>>> so you don't live here.</i>

33:57.603 --> 33:58.335
<i>>> no.</i>

33:58.337 --> 33:59.736
<i>>> and do you know kidd?</i>

33:59.738 --> 34:01.271
<i>>> kidd, yes, for, like, a</i>

34:01.273 --> 34:02.005
<i>Month.</i>

34:02.007 --> 34:02.906
<i>>> are you doing this as a favor</i>

34:02.908 --> 34:03.974
<i>To him?</i>

34:03.976 --> 34:05.242
<i>>> he called me.</i>

34:05.244 --> 34:06.543
<i>He's like, "hey, we need a</i>

34:06.545 --> 34:09.612
<i>Studio to record the show at.</i>

34:09.614 --> 34:10.746
<i>Do you know any good studios?</i>

34:10.748 --> 34:11.715
<i>I said, "yeah."</i>

34:11.717 --> 34:12.516
<i>>> and what do you think?</i>

34:12.518 --> 34:13.617
<i>Is he the real deal?</i>

34:13.619 --> 34:16.353
<i>>> um...</i>

34:16.355 --> 34:28.231
<i>>> this episode of</i>

34:28.233 --> 34:29.599
<i>Catfish: The tv show</i> continues

34:29.601 --> 34:33.437
Now.

34:33.438 --> 34:34.905
>> so you've never actually seen

34:34.907 --> 34:36.306
Him, like, working on any of

34:36.308 --> 34:37.007
The...

34:37.009 --> 34:37.706
>> mm-mm.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.275
So every time, like, he came

34:39.277 --> 34:40.543
With something, it was

34:40.545 --> 34:41.210
Already...

34:41.213 --> 34:42.344
>> it was already made.

34:42.347 --> 34:43.080
>> yeah.

34:43.081 --> 34:43.813
>> all right, well, let's go

34:43.815 --> 34:44.481
Back down.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.382
>> all right, cool.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.583
>> all right, let's find our way

34:47.585 --> 34:51.922
Over to the living room.

34:51.924 --> 34:54.123
>> I talked to hadi upstairs,

34:54.126 --> 34:56.993
And he broke down to me that he

34:56.995 --> 35:00.530
Is not an engineer.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.466
>> I need answers, because it's

35:02.468 --> 35:04.968
Like everything that you put me

35:04.970 --> 35:06.603
Through for those two weeks,

35:06.605 --> 35:08.505
Like, you had me call all these

35:08.507 --> 35:10.874
People under false pretenses

35:10.876 --> 35:12.742
That I was going to be with the

35:12.744 --> 35:13.777
Label, that I was going to get a

35:13.779 --> 35:14.544
Job.

35:14.546 --> 35:15.278
You had me get all these

35:15.280 --> 35:16.113
Security guards.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.614
You had me call the driver and

35:17.616 --> 35:18.748
Drive you around.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.417
This is nothing to play with.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.919
These are people's livelihoods.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.488
>> what's driving you?

35:24.490 --> 35:25.755
What do you want?

35:25.757 --> 35:26.623
>> the only thing I want to do

35:26.625 --> 35:27.524
Is to have a break, the

35:27.526 --> 35:28.592
Opportunity to show people what

35:28.594 --> 35:30.460
I can do, because with me making

35:30.462 --> 35:32.129
Music, I actually really know

35:32.131 --> 35:33.130
What the heck I'm doing, and I'm

35:33.132 --> 35:34.097
Really good.

35:34.099 --> 35:35.031
>> all I know is that the songs

35:35.033 --> 35:36.133
That you played are other

35:36.135 --> 35:36.967
People's songs.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.336
We found them on other websites.

35:39.338 --> 35:40.303
We know it's not your stuff.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.171
If you had real music to show

35:41.173 --> 35:41.872
Us, you would have shown it to

35:41.874 --> 35:42.572
Us.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.740
You don't.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.509
And then we drove around with a

35:45.511 --> 35:47.844
Very lovely woman who recently

35:47.846 --> 35:48.812
Drove you around just a couple

35:48.814 --> 35:51.781
Weeks ago, who spent $3,000 of

35:51.783 --> 35:54.518
Her own money renting fancier

35:54.520 --> 35:56.419
Cars for you because suburban

35:56.421 --> 35:57.621
Wasn't good enough.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.389
You wanted the mercedes.

35:59.391 --> 36:00.790
You scammed her just the way you

36:00.792 --> 36:01.892
Scammed the security guards.

36:01.894 --> 36:05.395
Like, you're a scam artist.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.630
>> I mean, basically, you

36:06.632 --> 36:07.764
Trying to, like, ruin--like,

36:07.766 --> 36:08.665
Humiliate me.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.432
>> no, no, no.

36:09.434 --> 36:10.200
You humiliated yourself.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.268
>> you've humiliated yourself.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.869
>> you think you know, but you

36:12.871 --> 36:13.637
Really don't.

36:13.639 --> 36:14.371
>> well, then tell us.

36:14.373 --> 36:15.038
We want to know.

36:15.040 --> 36:15.705
>> you've been, like,

36:15.707 --> 36:16.473
Disrespectful this whole time.

36:16.475 --> 36:17.641
Like, I'm not going to allow you

36:17.643 --> 36:18.808
To disrespect my talent because

36:18.810 --> 36:19.643
I actually am talented.

36:19.645 --> 36:20.410
I'm not going to allow that to

36:20.412 --> 36:21.144
Happen.

36:21.146 --> 36:21.978
>> those are good, hardworking

36:21.980 --> 36:23.847
People who are struggling now

36:23.849 --> 36:25.348
Because of some the choices

36:25.350 --> 36:26.283
You've made.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.784
>> I don't have the time to

36:27.786 --> 36:29.119
Steal nobody's stuff.

36:29.121 --> 36:31.855
I don't do that.

36:31.857 --> 36:38.395
>> we just want to understand.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.196
>> I'm not trying to deceive

36:39.198 --> 36:40.096
People, scam people.

36:40.098 --> 36:40.997
That's not--that's not--

36:40.999 --> 36:42.065
>> but that's how they're going

36:42.067 --> 36:43.066
To see it.

36:43.068 --> 36:44.401
I can understand doing it once,

36:44.403 --> 36:45.335
But, like, why'd you do it,

36:45.337 --> 36:48.705
Like, three times?

36:48.707 --> 36:58.582
But, like, right now you've

36:58.584 --> 37:00.383
Used up a lot of goodwill.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.385
You owe these people money.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.720
I know you probably can't give

37:03.722 --> 37:07.824
Them the money that you took.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.326
I don't know if it's, like, an

37:09.328 --> 37:10.393
Apology.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.294
You're just like, "look, I'm

37:11.296 --> 37:12.028
Really sorry," or just

37:12.030 --> 37:12.696
Something.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.364
Like, it might make you feel

37:14.366 --> 37:16.266
Better, it might make them feel

37:16.268 --> 37:17.133
Better.

37:17.135 --> 37:21.571
>> yeah.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.741
>> what is it that drives you to

37:24.743 --> 37:27.210
Do this?

37:27.212 --> 37:30.146
>> so, I mean...

37:30.148 --> 37:33.183
When I was 16, we had to stay

37:33.185 --> 37:35.252
In a shelter.

37:35.254 --> 37:36.620
The director of the shelter put

37:36.622 --> 37:40.357
Us in foster care.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.291
"I want to be a music producer.

37:41.293 --> 37:41.958
I want to make beats and

37:41.960 --> 37:42.659
Everything."

37:42.661 --> 37:44.160
And then that's when, like, the

37:44.162 --> 37:45.695
Social worker was like, "you're

37:45.697 --> 37:47.831
Not going to, like, be anything.

37:47.833 --> 37:48.898
Like, you can't make music."

37:48.900 --> 37:49.799
They didn't take me seriously.

37:49.801 --> 37:50.867
I really got pissed off.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.703
>> if you're trying to make a

37:53.705 --> 37:55.138
Name for yourself, this isn't

37:55.140 --> 37:56.206
How you do it.

37:56.208 --> 37:57.540
You have to work hard.

37:57.542 --> 37:59.209
You have to make mistakes.

37:59.211 --> 38:00.877
You have to find out for

38:00.879 --> 38:02.012
Yourself.

38:02.014 --> 38:03.713
But the main thing about it is

38:03.715 --> 38:05.448
That you have to do the work.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.117
You just can't get it overnight

38:07.119 --> 38:08.084
Like that.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.419
If nobody can trust you, then

38:09.421 --> 38:10.387
They're not going to put

38:10.389 --> 38:13.089
Themselves out there to even try

38:13.091 --> 38:14.891
To get to know you to even give

38:14.893 --> 38:15.892
You that respect that you're

38:15.894 --> 38:19.462
Trying to get from them.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.931
>> you're too smart to be doing

38:21.933 --> 38:24.701
What you're doing, and it would

38:24.703 --> 38:28.805
Suck to see you continue to make

38:28.807 --> 38:31.374
Some of these bad decisions

38:31.376 --> 38:34.411
>> well, definitely the route

38:34.413 --> 38:36.279
That I'm going is not correct,

38:36.281 --> 38:37.013
So...

38:37.015 --> 38:39.449
I'll just--and I'll work on

38:39.451 --> 38:41.251
Myself and, like, get things

38:41.253 --> 38:44.120
Done and everything like that.

38:44.122 --> 38:45.789
That's pretty much how I got to

38:45.791 --> 38:46.990
Do it, so...

38:46.992 --> 38:48.124
>> we'll look forward to

38:48.126 --> 38:48.858
Seeing...

38:48.860 --> 38:49.559
>> the changes.

38:49.561 --> 38:52.062
>> seeing that happen.

38:52.064 --> 38:53.863
>> all right.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.865

38:55.867 --> 38:59.669

39:14.119 --> 39:15.418

39:15.420 --> 39:16.619
