WEBVTT

00:14.080 --> 00:16.916
- I mean, how did it happen?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.518
- She obviously had unmet needs.

00:18.585 --> 00:21.021
- I've known Benny Balthazar for 12 years.

00:21.087 --> 00:22.756
I could never have imagined that she would have done

00:22.856 --> 00:24.591
anything like that. She was boring.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.926
- O-okay, I-I need to come clean.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.929
She was in love with my friend, Dr. Carpet.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.765
And he was, like, leading her on.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.233
It's all his fault!

00:33.333 --> 00:36.269
- It's this dastardly workplace environment.

00:36.369 --> 00:40.407
And we have it all on camera.

00:40.507 --> 00:43.109
- You see how horrid this place is.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.945
Scientists bungeeing to their deaths on a whim

00:46.046 --> 00:49.749
and petite lesbians poisoning one another!

00:49.849 --> 00:53.787
- Okay, you guys really need to stop gaslighting me on this.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.955
- You were literally holding poison.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.891
- You were

00:57.957 --> 00:59.459
- You know, there's good attention and bad attention.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.961
This has quickly become very bad attention.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.298
I've never been associated with anything like this in my life.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.967
I hate to say this, but, Dory Sief,

01:08.068 --> 01:09.402
I'm removing you from this company.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.604
- What? - And I think that you need

01:11.704 --> 01:13.440
to leave the premises immediately.

01:13.540 --> 01:16.076
- Are you serious? You cannot remove Dory from this company.

01:16.142 --> 01:19.646
- Do you even understand what she knows and what she sees?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.981
- Oh, my God, no, you have to stop believing in her.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.085
She's insane, and anyone who believes her is insane.

01:25.151 --> 01:26.820
- All right, settle down. - Can I get in the circle?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.055
- This is all too much, not my brand.

01:29.122 --> 01:30.990
- Wait, Dory, we can't stop now.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.059
We did it. I know we did it.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.562
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:35.628 --> 01:36.896
- Dory, please don't make this

01:36.963 --> 01:40.433
more difficult than it needs to be.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.968
There we go.

01:47.574 --> 01:49.275
I'm sorry.

01:49.342 --> 01:53.513
It gives me no pleasure to have things end this way.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.682
- I wish it all worked out differently.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.250
- Yeah.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.285
- But Tunnel,

01:59.352 --> 02:03.990
I want to thank you for the teachings.

02:04.090 --> 02:06.126
- Okay.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.371
What are you doing?

02:18.471 --> 02:20.673
Ms. Sief, did you just lock that door?

02:20.773 --> 02:23.209
This is not the time for games. Open the door.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.179
- I won't be leaving until the job is done.

02:26.279 --> 02:28.214
- What? Hey, don't--what?

02:28.314 --> 02:30.817
Open the door. Don't walk away from me.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.394
- There's you, there's you, there's me,

02:41.494 --> 02:43.563
and there's a bunch of people marching with impaled heads.

02:43.663 --> 02:44.898
- Is this Brooklyn?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.333
- Drew, this is art. It's actually good.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.702
I think it could be, like, a classic.

02:49.802 --> 02:52.539
- Well, it was totally alive and in perfect health.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.073
- Hi. - You're back?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.409
- Yes. Ritchie, listen. I need you to find a way

02:56.509 --> 02:58.811
to make some kind of lethal weapon out of that lab.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.480
- A lethal weapon? - Yeah.

03:00.547 --> 03:03.416
We're not gonna hurt anyone. It's just to make a point.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.085
- Yeah. Okay, I can do that. - All right, act fast.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.420
- Go and get your passport.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.821
The plane waits us at Teterboro.

03:08.888 --> 03:10.823
- I've burned it, Mummy, so that I'd never

03:10.890 --> 03:12.358
have to go back. - What?

03:12.425 --> 03:13.726
- Hey, I thought you were escorted out?

03:13.826 --> 03:15.328
- I'm back. Listen, I need you

03:15.395 --> 03:17.931
to get enough duct tape to detain three people.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.999
- But she's evil!

03:20.066 --> 03:21.601
- Sorry, actually four people.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.069
And get some of the others to help you, all right?

03:23.169 --> 03:24.504
We need to act fast, but make sure that

03:24.571 --> 03:25.939
nobody gets hurt in the process.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.507
- Okay. Wait, what?

03:27.574 --> 03:29.342
- The meditation room is a good place to hold them.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.110
- Okay, okay.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.388
- That's my girl. That's my girl!

03:42.455 --> 03:44.591
- I just imagine the Sinister Trinity

03:44.691 --> 03:46.693
and, like, just how they think they can just

03:46.759 --> 03:48.361
hide their entire agenda from us,

03:48.428 --> 03:51.631
and I just let the rage, like, flood me.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.300
- And that's exactly why I chose you, Chantal.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.702
- Oh, God.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.470
Liquorice, this has truly been the most,

03:57.570 --> 04:00.640
like, incredible education of my life.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.475
Like, it actually makes me sick

04:02.575 --> 04:04.544
to think about how blind I used to be.

04:04.611 --> 04:05.745
- Now that you know so much,

04:05.812 --> 04:07.113
why don't you come on full-time

04:07.213 --> 04:09.382
as my official intern?

04:09.449 --> 04:12.051
You're gonna want to quit your day job.

04:12.118 --> 04:13.319
- That's perfect. I don't work.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.488
24 hours a day, wow.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.757
Does that mean I'm gonna have to move in with you?

04:17.824 --> 04:19.225
- Yeah, probably so,

04:19.292 --> 04:21.494
until you're ready to truly protect yourself.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.000
- Dory Sief and her staff at LYTE,

04:27.100 --> 04:29.168
the controversial pharmaceutical endeavor

04:29.269 --> 04:30.603
have barricaded themselves

04:30.670 --> 04:31.838
into their workspace headquarters

04:31.938 --> 04:33.640
in Brooklyn, New York today,

04:33.740 --> 04:37.577
after scientist Benny Balthazar fell out a window to her death.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.079
Sief has denied access to the building

04:40.146 --> 04:43.016
and is holding several innocent bystanders hostage

04:43.116 --> 04:44.851
while her staff mans the windows

04:44.951 --> 04:48.254
armed with spray bottles filled with sulfuric acid.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.822
The hostages have been identified

04:49.922 --> 04:52.525
as the former lover of Ms. Sief, Drew Gardner,

04:52.625 --> 04:54.994
the Grand Duchess and Arch Duchess of Bellhead,

04:55.094 --> 04:57.196
Winnifred and Beatrice Hamsdale,

04:57.297 --> 04:58.865
and a camera man with no family

04:58.965 --> 05:00.967
by the name of Vernon Ankles.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.036
The Hamsdale's were confronting their daughter

05:03.136 --> 05:04.971
live as part of a special program

05:05.038 --> 05:07.206
for the British network Satellite Four

05:07.307 --> 05:08.341
when the event happened.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.344
Sief released a public statement

05:11.444 --> 05:14.113
across her own social media platforms earlier today,

05:14.180 --> 05:15.615
outlining her agenda.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.851
- We've discovered a formula for enlightenment,

05:18.951 --> 05:20.720
but they're trying to shut us down.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.823
So we've decided to take things into our own hands.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.392
Keep your faith in me, and stay tuned

05:26.492 --> 05:27.894
'cause soon,

05:27.994 --> 05:31.064
you will get everything your heart ever wanted.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.799
Let's change the world.

05:46.879 --> 05:50.016
- There are entrances here, here, and here,

05:50.083 --> 05:51.584
all of which should be avoided

05:51.684 --> 05:55.088
because a spray-bottle squirt could reach any of them.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.765
- Open up! This is insane!

06:05.865 --> 06:07.266
- Oh, shut up.

06:07.367 --> 06:12.238
Have you never been taken hostage before, dimwit?

06:12.338 --> 06:14.040
- I guess not,

06:14.107 --> 06:16.743
but I really feel like I have. -

06:16.843 --> 06:19.779
- Oh, we're just all, um,

06:19.879 --> 06:23.182
truly devastated by the loss of Doctor Benny Balthazar.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.852
Those closest to her knew her,

06:25.918 --> 06:28.354
of course, as somebody who is dedicated, um,

06:28.421 --> 06:33.092
tremendously to her great work but also...

06:33.192 --> 06:35.194
somebody who liked a fun party.

06:35.261 --> 06:37.797
You know, she was very popular amongst men.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.099
She will be missed by the thousands.

06:40.199 --> 06:42.368
- This incident took place on your watch

06:42.435 --> 06:43.636
and people are discussing

06:43.736 --> 06:44.971
whether or not you're fit to lead.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.305
What do you have to say about that?

06:46.406 --> 06:50.576
- A good leader, um, takes risks,

06:50.643 --> 06:51.944
and sometimes those risks

06:52.044 --> 06:54.213
don't turn out exactly as you'd hope.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.884
But, for right now, I'm working hand in hand with the FBI,

06:57.950 --> 06:59.152
who, by the way,

06:59.252 --> 07:01.721
doing an absolutely magnificent job.

07:01.788 --> 07:04.157
And I'm gonna be donating a fleet

07:04.257 --> 07:08.127
of the new Tunnel XF99 car

07:08.227 --> 07:13.399
to be used by the entirety of the NYPD because,

07:13.466 --> 07:14.801
well, it's the least that I can do.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.809
Dory, Dory, Dory, Dory,

07:22.909 --> 07:27.647
Dory, Dory, Dory, Dory, Dory!

07:38.925 --> 07:42.662
- Hey, everyone.

07:42.762 --> 07:45.598
I just want to take a moment

07:45.665 --> 07:49.702
to acknowledge the courage

07:49.802 --> 07:53.639
that you are all exhibiting right now

07:53.706 --> 07:55.675
in the face of adversity.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.844
It is truly profound.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.514
And I am so honored to work beside you

08:01.614 --> 08:04.717
in this critical moment in history.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.953
So take a look around

08:07.019 --> 08:09.722
because these are the faces of the people

08:09.822 --> 08:11.724
who are strong enough

08:11.824 --> 08:14.827
to usher in a new era.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.063
Things are going to get rocky,

08:17.163 --> 08:21.067
but you've been preparing for this fight since day one.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.202
'Cause they might try to stop us,

08:23.302 --> 08:28.241
but they can never take away our light!

08:32.845 --> 08:34.514
- Oh, my God. -

08:34.580 --> 08:36.549
- This is getting out of hand. This is getting out of hand.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.752
- Babe, this is the revolution, you know what I mean?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.087
We're prepared for this.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.422
We're just in the messy middle right now.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.657
- Hey, Portia,

08:44.724 --> 08:47.360
you sound crazy. - I'm devoted.

08:47.426 --> 08:49.428
- Mm-hmm.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.397
- You do want the pill, right?

08:51.497 --> 08:53.099
- Literally more than anything.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.600
I mean, I just don't want to be charged

08:54.700 --> 08:57.436
for stowing hostages at acid-point.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.272
I mean, I guess I can talk some reason into her,

08:59.372 --> 09:01.741
but she'll probably just lock me up like her little Drew.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.776
- Hey, she probably locked Drew up for a very good reason.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.278
And I don't know if it makes you feel better,

09:05.378 --> 09:08.080
but I'm really not worried at all.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.916
- Look, I want this pill to get made,

09:10.016 --> 09:11.784
but if it doesn't, I'm not afraid to say

09:11.884 --> 09:13.686
that I was just following orders.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.755
- Would you like me to talk to her for you?

09:15.855 --> 09:17.223
- Mm-mmm.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.925
You're already on thin ice because you poisoned her.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.459
- Look, I don't know if you heard, but we actually

09:20.560 --> 09:21.727
figured the whole poisoning conversation out

09:21.794 --> 09:23.129
and I didn't do it.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.463
Like, everyone knows that I didn't do it.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.098
Like, it wasn't me.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.635
- Portia.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.737
- It wasn't.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.541
- Oh.

09:35.608 --> 09:38.210
Dying for the loo.

09:38.277 --> 09:41.080
I'm sure it's high time we changed your nappy, Mummy.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.883
- Oh, I imagine so.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.718
- I don't want to die.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.219
I just want to go out to get drinks

09:47.286 --> 09:49.488
and hang out for the rest of my life.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.457
I can't cut that short!

09:51.557 --> 09:54.093
If we make it out of here, I'm gonna buy you

09:54.160 --> 09:56.829
the biggest margarita you've ever seen, okay?

09:56.929 --> 09:57.997
- Oh.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.166
- Help!

10:02.935 --> 10:05.004
- Hey, Dory,

10:05.104 --> 10:08.007
I think some of these people need to pee.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.909
- I don't think that's a possibility.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.344
- I think they should piss themselves.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.845
- Are hostages allowed to pee

10:12.945 --> 10:14.413
or should we be doing something else?

10:14.480 --> 10:17.617
- I--I don't know.

10:17.683 --> 10:19.852
- Hey, Dor, do you want one of our beautiful snacks?

10:19.952 --> 10:21.187
- No, thank you.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.126
- Beautiful snack?

10:27.193 --> 10:28.995
- Dory, Dory! - Oh, Ritchie,

10:29.095 --> 10:30.863
deconstructed PB&J? - No!

10:30.963 --> 10:32.365
I just want to let you know that we're all set up

10:32.465 --> 10:33.799
to replicate the formula,

10:33.866 --> 10:35.368
but there's a technical issue with the machine

10:35.468 --> 10:36.869
that we're still working on.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.204
- Okay, so how long is that going to take?

10:38.304 --> 10:39.705
- Well, I'm not tech support,

10:39.805 --> 10:42.375
but there is a tutorial online that I looked at.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.609
I'll try my best? - Okay, just hurry.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.211
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.114
- Also, should I answer that or should I let it linger?

10:48.180 --> 10:49.548
- Answer it. - Okay.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.885
Hello, this is LYTE headquarters,

10:52.985 --> 10:54.720
birthplace of the forthcoming existential revolution.

10:54.820 --> 10:58.057
This is Orange LYTE speaking. How can I guide you today?

10:58.157 --> 11:01.794
Mm-hmm. Okay.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.963
It's for you.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.672
- Hello? - Hello, Ms. Sief,

11:12.738 --> 11:14.473
this is Walter Camp with the FBI.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.542
We have the building surrounded, and there's no way

11:16.642 --> 11:20.312
you're going to get out of this unless you cooperate.

11:20.379 --> 11:21.480
I'm curious.

11:21.547 --> 11:24.517
Are you crazy or just stupid?

11:24.583 --> 11:25.518
- What do you want?

11:25.584 --> 11:27.687
- Let's be reasonable.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.722
There's no way you can get out of this, right?

11:29.822 --> 11:31.257
Have you had a look outside?

11:31.357 --> 11:33.693
You should take a peek. It's a quite a scene.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.594
We have a full militia.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.564
We even have snipers all for you.

11:38.664 --> 11:39.765
- Well, I'm flattered.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.168
- Look, come out now,

11:42.234 --> 11:44.003
it won't be that bad on you.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.905
You'll get a year, tops.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.373
And, who knows?

11:47.440 --> 11:50.209
Maybe you can charm the jury, like last time.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.877
So what do you say?

11:51.944 --> 11:53.612
Do you want to end this before it gets out of hand?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.449
- What's out of hand is that the human race

11:56.549 --> 11:59.585
has been drowning in false ideological structure

11:59.685 --> 12:01.921
since the beginning of time.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.124
So what are you going to do about that?

12:05.224 --> 12:07.793
- That's a tough one.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.061
I don't know.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.730
- Well, I do.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.535
- Did you forget to pay your electric bill, Dor?

12:16.602 --> 12:18.771
- Please turn the lights back on.

12:18.871 --> 12:22.141
- How are you gonna make your pills without electricity?

12:22.241 --> 12:25.478
I bet it gets pretty hot up there without AC, right?

12:25.578 --> 12:28.247
I hear it's supposed to reach to 101 degrees.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.219
- I think I've just pissed myself.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.920
- Oh, it's just sweat.

12:34.987 --> 12:36.889
If you had peed yourself,

12:36.956 --> 12:39.158
you'd jolly-well know it.

12:39.258 --> 12:43.763
- I definitely went pee-pee.

12:43.829 --> 12:47.666
I thought we all agreed we were just gonna let it go.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.169
- What?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.838
- So I'm the only one who peed his pants?

12:52.938 --> 12:57.510
- Okay, Portia, can I talk to you for a second?

12:57.610 --> 12:58.744
What did you mean when you said

12:58.811 --> 13:01.981
that you and Dory were having sex?

13:02.081 --> 13:05.918
- I mean, we're girlfriends.

13:05.985 --> 13:08.187
- Okay, well I'm pretty sure she's fucking Drew.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.321
- Well, so am I.

13:09.421 --> 13:10.689
- What?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.958
- It's just what it's like to, like,

13:13.025 --> 13:14.527
live this way.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.695
- So you're all just, like, fucking each other?

13:16.796 --> 13:19.698
- Yeah, but it's also, like, love too.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.602
- I'm sorry, am--am I hideous?

13:23.669 --> 13:26.705
- Elliot? Elliot?

13:26.806 --> 13:30.109
- Marc? - Elliot?

13:30.176 --> 13:32.978
- Oh, my God.

13:34.346 --> 13:35.815
- Elliot! - Marc?

13:35.881 --> 13:37.883
- Come on, kid. Tell him what he needs to hear.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.552
Get him to talk some sense to that girl.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.221
- Elliot, baby, it's me, Marc, your life partner.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.390
- I know who you are, obviously.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.559
What are you doing here? I'm handling it!

13:46.659 --> 13:49.495
- They asked me to come here and say a few words

13:49.562 --> 13:52.898
to try and get you all to come out.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.233
But I don't care about that.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.801
I need you all to do whatever it takes

13:55.868 --> 13:58.571
to make that pill. Take as long as you need.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.972
- What are you doing? - Hold on.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.674
I am staying at a hotel these days

14:01.740 --> 14:03.542
because I'm scared of our son.

14:03.642 --> 14:06.412
He cut me, the entire length of my arm.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.514
But I guess that's why God gave me two arms.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.350
Make that pill, baby, make a bunch of 'em!

14:11.417 --> 14:12.918
- Are you out of your damn mind?

14:13.018 --> 14:15.254
You are the worst hostage loved one in history.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.424
- Oh, God. Okay.

14:19.892 --> 14:21.527
Hey, Dory.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.062
So we have gotta make this pill.

14:23.162 --> 14:26.165
What can I do to help? - I don't know, okay?

14:26.232 --> 14:28.934
I'm just--I'm--

14:29.034 --> 14:30.102
I'm trying to figure that out.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.839
- Would it help if we had sex?

14:33.906 --> 14:37.109
- What? Why would that help?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.777
- I mean, you tell me.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.413
Like, if it comes down to that in any way just let me know,

14:41.513 --> 14:43.215
just 'cause I would hate it if you ever thought that

14:43.282 --> 14:47.086
I was someone that you couldn't have sex with.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.454
- Okay.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.122
Yeah, thank you for sharing that.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.601
- I'm--yeah.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.638
- Moments ago, the Board of Tunnel Industries

15:05.738 --> 15:07.406
announced that they're meeting today

15:07.473 --> 15:09.308
to discuss what the future of the company would look like

15:09.408 --> 15:10.809
if they moved on without you?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.711
Does this mean that you're going to be replaced?

15:15.714 --> 15:17.816
No, no. No, that's a formality.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.985
They meet once a week like that.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.389
You know, we're a family, and, uh, what family doesn't

15:23.455 --> 15:26.458
discuss ousting the father on a weekly basis?

15:26.558 --> 15:27.826
You know, everybody knows

15:27.927 --> 15:32.231
there's no Tunnel Industries without...

15:32.298 --> 15:33.766
Mr. Tunnel.

15:36.568 --> 15:38.804
- It's hot. Ugh.

15:48.847 --> 15:52.318
- Hi.

15:52.418 --> 15:55.688
How you doin'?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.691
- Uh, well, it's really hot,

15:58.791 --> 16:00.759
we're running out of food and water,

16:00.826 --> 16:02.695
I have to figure out how to make these pills

16:02.795 --> 16:04.263
without electricity,

16:04.330 --> 16:05.864
and I have to figure out how to get us all out of here,

16:05.965 --> 16:07.433
so it's a lot on my shoulders.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.668
- Totally. Can I talk to you about something?

16:09.768 --> 16:10.636
- Sure.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.204
- I promise

16:12.304 --> 16:15.174
that I was not the one poisoning you.

16:15.274 --> 16:18.143
Truly, I would never lie to you

16:18.210 --> 16:19.378
about something like this.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.380
I love you so much.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.681
You mean so much to me.

16:22.781 --> 16:24.717
I could never, ever, ever hurt you.

16:24.817 --> 16:28.053
And, if I'm being completely honest, like,

16:28.153 --> 16:30.055
it actually really hurt me

16:30.155 --> 16:32.157
to think that you could ever think that I could

16:32.224 --> 16:36.695
honestly ever do something like that.

16:36.795 --> 16:37.830
- I'm sorry, it just--

16:37.896 --> 16:41.066
it really seemed like you did it,

16:41.166 --> 16:44.803
but I know things aren't always as they seem.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.141
I believe you.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.843
Will you forgive me?

16:53.879 --> 16:55.881
- Okay, I did it. - What?

16:55.981 --> 16:58.217
Oh, Portia! - I'm sorry! I did it!

16:58.317 --> 17:00.486
I swear that I didn't ever mean to hurt you.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.154
The thing is, like,

17:02.221 --> 17:04.590
I need you and I need you to need me

17:04.690 --> 17:07.026
and I just could feel you kind of slipping away

17:07.092 --> 17:08.827
and I just don't know who I am without you.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.562
- Hey, it's okay. It's okay. - Do you forgive me, please?

17:10.662 --> 17:12.931
I feel really bad. Do you forgive me?

17:13.031 --> 17:14.400
- Sure.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.835
- Really? - Yeah.

17:16.902 --> 17:18.837
- Can we be girlfriends again?

17:18.904 --> 17:22.174
- Portia-- - Hi. so, guys,

17:22.241 --> 17:24.209
tonight for dinner we have to have

17:24.276 --> 17:26.045
all the perishable stuff

17:26.111 --> 17:27.746
and then we can dig into the chips

17:27.846 --> 17:30.215
and all that jellybean-like stuff.

17:30.282 --> 17:34.386
- Wait! Do we still have gas?

17:34.453 --> 17:39.925
Maybe we could make, like, enlightenment jellybeans.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.631
- Is that crazy?

17:45.731 --> 17:48.367
I don't see why it wouldn't work.

17:48.434 --> 17:52.905
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

17:52.971 --> 17:55.974
I'm bursting. I'm going to burst!

17:56.075 --> 17:57.943
- Go ahead and burst.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.479
- You didn't burst yet? I already burst it twice.

18:00.579 --> 18:04.149
- No bursting! Guys, come on, for the love of God!

18:04.249 --> 18:07.886
Let us out! We have basic human needs.

18:10.322 --> 18:11.757
Come on!

18:14.426 --> 18:16.562
- They're gonna, like, break down the glass.

18:16.628 --> 18:19.164
- Damn, they're so privileged. - Come on!

18:19.264 --> 18:21.433
Please, we're not gonna try any bullshit.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.768
I swear to God!

18:22.835 --> 18:25.070
We just want to use the bathroom.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.472
- What's going on?

18:26.572 --> 18:28.006
- They're bitching about using the bathroom.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.442
- Dory, please, there are elderly women in here.

18:30.509 --> 18:31.944
- I hope you're not referring to me.

18:32.010 --> 18:33.645
- Oh, of course, of course. Marty, Winnie,

18:33.745 --> 18:35.147
why don't you just show 'em where the bathroom is?

18:35.247 --> 18:37.015
What's the big deal? - When I asked--

18:37.116 --> 18:38.117
never mind, it's fine.

18:38.183 --> 18:39.852
- It's inhumane, okay?

18:39.952 --> 18:42.421
Just take 'em to the bathroom.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.325
- Thank you.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.461
- Okay, no funny business, all right?

18:49.528 --> 18:51.196
- How's it going in here? - Pretty good.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.598
It's a bit of a production,

18:52.664 --> 18:54.266
but we're about ready to make the beans.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.468
- Okay, it smells good.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.141
- Would you lean back? Put the acid down.

19:02.207 --> 19:05.711
- That was brilliant.

19:05.811 --> 19:09.381
Oh, oh, thank you. - Of course.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.049
No big deal.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.384
- So tell me,

19:12.484 --> 19:15.387
have you ever been to Bellhead County?

19:15.487 --> 19:18.157
- You know, actually, I haven't.

19:18.223 --> 19:19.625
- Mm. - Can you, like, tell me

19:19.691 --> 19:21.126
something about it that, like, I wouldn't know?

19:21.193 --> 19:24.329
- Well, there's hundreds of thousands of accounts

19:24.396 --> 19:29.535
that Bellhead... is a portal...to hell!

19:29.635 --> 19:30.836
- Oh, my God, right? -

19:32.404 --> 19:35.340
He sprayed acid on my arm!

19:35.407 --> 19:37.342
My fucking arm! - Okay, okay. Okay!

19:37.409 --> 19:40.512
- On my fucking arm! - Come here, come here.

19:40.579 --> 19:41.647
Here you go, pal.

19:41.713 --> 19:43.182
- I'm so sorry, guys.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.083
I thought this was the closed position, you know?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.419
- Stop pointing it at me now. - What happened? What happened?

19:47.519 --> 19:48.921
- It was him! - It wasn't my fault!

19:49.021 --> 19:50.189
It wasn't my fault! They tried to escape

19:50.255 --> 19:51.723
and then the Grand Duchess came in

19:51.823 --> 19:53.325
and she hit me in the head with a toilet seat!

19:53.392 --> 19:55.994
I'm a good person, I promise! I'm just a DJ!

19:56.061 --> 19:57.396
- We're just getting word

19:57.496 --> 19:59.398
that it seems that someone has been injured.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.700
We don't know if it's a member of the Royal Family

20:01.767 --> 20:04.102
or Drew Gardner or if it's the other one,

20:04.203 --> 20:06.772
but we can confirm that one of the hostages

20:06.872 --> 20:09.107
has been sprayed with acid and could be injured.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.745
- I feel literally so bad.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.681
Let me buy you a drink when this is all over, okay?

20:15.747 --> 20:17.783
- It's just pain. It's not real, okay?

20:17.883 --> 20:20.285
Breathe. Breathe through it.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.887
What?

20:21.954 --> 20:23.589
- You're losing your grip on the situation, Dory.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.958
People are getting hurt, and that's making me look bad.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.026
Why don't we get on the same page here?

20:28.093 --> 20:29.394
- Everything's going as it should.

20:29.461 --> 20:30.696
- Save it, Dory.

20:30.762 --> 20:31.730
You dug yourself a deep hole,

20:31.797 --> 20:33.198
and there's no way out.

20:33.265 --> 20:36.468
Why don't you just give up while you behind--

20:38.237 --> 20:40.038
- You'll need to strip naked on my stoop

20:40.105 --> 20:41.373
and throw it all in the neighbor's trash

20:41.440 --> 20:43.442
before coming in.

20:43.542 --> 20:49.147
- Hm.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.482
- Lies.

20:50.582 --> 20:54.119
Coercion.

20:54.219 --> 20:56.388
Oh.

20:56.455 --> 20:59.891
Oh, no. Oh, no.

20:59.958 --> 21:02.327
- What?

21:02.427 --> 21:04.496
- It's a letter from myself,

21:04.596 --> 21:06.832
from the future. -

21:06.932 --> 21:11.336
The future?

21:11.436 --> 21:15.240
- I've been getting them ever since I was a little girl.

21:19.778 --> 21:23.415
- Oh, my God, what? What?

21:23.482 --> 21:26.585
- It's about you. - Me?

21:26.652 --> 21:30.589
- It says that you are to have a child, a boy.

21:30.656 --> 21:34.593
And that that boy will bring about the end of the world.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.695
- - No!

21:36.795 --> 21:38.463
- What?

21:38.530 --> 21:40.365
No!

21:40.465 --> 21:43.869
- You mate with a man named John Halwood.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.672
Oh, Jesus.

21:48.607 --> 21:53.178
- This is more than I-- than I know what to do with!

21:55.681 --> 21:58.183
- He needs to go to the hospital.

21:58.283 --> 22:00.485
I know a third-degree burn when I see it.

22:00.552 --> 22:03.188
Now, make me in charge of this.

22:03.288 --> 22:04.823
- This needs to stop right now, Dory, all right?

22:04.890 --> 22:09.528
You need to get it together.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.463
Dory, what are you doing?

22:11.530 --> 22:13.865
We don't even know if this pill that you're making works.

22:13.965 --> 22:16.401
- It does. I know it does.

22:16.501 --> 22:19.371
There are moments in the timeline of humanity

22:19.471 --> 22:23.408
where we've needed to take a leap of faith to keep going.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.177
This is just one of those times.

22:25.243 --> 22:27.312
- What you're saying is delusional.

22:27.379 --> 22:31.049
Come on, Dory, you basically killed your own doctor.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.518
- If he killed himself, and that is true,

22:33.585 --> 22:35.420
then that is absolutely heartbreaking.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.155
But all I am responsible for

22:37.222 --> 22:38.990
is sharing my own experience.

22:39.057 --> 22:40.759
- You need real help, all right?

22:40.859 --> 22:42.994
You're a danger to yourself and to others.

22:43.061 --> 22:46.431
What you believe to be reality is not reality.

22:46.531 --> 22:50.068
- You're right, my reality is different than yours

22:50.168 --> 22:51.536
and most people's,

22:51.603 --> 22:54.406
because most people are living in an illusion.

22:54.506 --> 22:57.743
I know because I used to live in that illusion,

22:57.843 --> 23:01.380
but now I see the truth.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.949
And the truth is that the world is sick,

23:04.049 --> 23:06.752
and it needs medicine, Drew.

23:06.852 --> 23:08.353
That's reality.

23:08.420 --> 23:11.289
- Then why are people getting hurt?

23:11.390 --> 23:14.025
- Because people are scared.

23:14.092 --> 23:15.627
'Cause we'd rather be in pain

23:15.727 --> 23:19.431
than find out who we really are.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.800
- Dory...

23:21.900 --> 23:24.035
I'm tapped out. - I know.

23:24.102 --> 23:27.205
- No, I don't think that you do know.

23:27.272 --> 23:29.040
Okay? 'Cause you're everywhere.

23:29.107 --> 23:30.776
You're in my thoughts, you're in my dreams.

23:30.876 --> 23:33.311
I try to shower you off, and it doesn't work.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.881
'Cause every single time I think that I get out,

23:35.947 --> 23:38.049
I look around and I realize

23:38.116 --> 23:39.985
I'm right back in it.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.955
Okay? And it is torture.

23:44.055 --> 23:47.459
I can't help you anymore.

23:50.629 --> 23:52.063
- You're upset

23:52.130 --> 23:55.901
because you want to be strong enough to let me go.

23:55.967 --> 23:58.837
You keep thinking that if she does one more bad thing

23:58.937 --> 24:03.275
then that'll be the proof I need to know that she's bad.

24:03.341 --> 24:06.244
But there's never enough proof, is there?

24:06.311 --> 24:09.848
Because I'm not bad

24:09.948 --> 24:12.851
and that's why you keep coming back to me.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.320
So if you're gonna come back,

24:15.420 --> 24:18.657
then really come back

24:18.757 --> 24:20.926
and really help me.

24:20.992 --> 24:23.528
And, if not,

24:23.628 --> 24:25.997
then you need to leave forever.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.837
- Yikes.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.371
That looks, like, really intense.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.707
I think she's probably honestly telling Drew

24:35.807 --> 24:37.309
about how she loved me more.

24:37.375 --> 24:40.545
Oh, that sucks for him.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.515
- It actually seems like she might be adding me to the mix.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.116
Nothing official yet but I can just tell

24:45.183 --> 24:47.052
I've definitely been in her thoughts, so--

24:47.152 --> 24:49.888
- What? - Yeah. One second.

24:49.988 --> 24:53.291
Hey, Dory, sexy gal. Fuck!

24:53.358 --> 24:55.961
Anyways, so, we are starving, we are hot,

24:56.027 --> 24:57.362
and we are humiliated,

24:57.462 --> 24:59.898
so we either need to give up and go home

24:59.998 --> 25:01.633
or we need to figure out a way to flee.

25:01.700 --> 25:05.237
But right now, this is not working.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.905
- Okay.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.975
- Okay.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.843
- Walter? - Yes.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.378
- I need a bus.

25:13.478 --> 25:15.747
A classic American school bus from the early '90s

25:15.847 --> 25:17.182
that can hold my disciples

25:17.249 --> 25:20.018
and a dozen large bags full of jellybeans.

25:20.085 --> 25:21.653
And then I want a plane waiting to take me

25:21.720 --> 25:24.523
and my people to Acapulco, Mexico.

25:24.589 --> 25:27.392
What do you say I trade you some hostages for our freedom?

25:27.492 --> 25:31.263
- It's with great sobriety that I, Tunnel Aloysius Quinn,

25:31.363 --> 25:34.599
have chosen to step down, effective immediately,

25:34.699 --> 25:38.103
as the CEO and founder of Tunnel Industries.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.105
While I've poured my heart and soul

25:40.205 --> 25:41.540
into building this company,

25:41.606 --> 25:43.441
which started in my grandmother's basement,

25:43.542 --> 25:46.678
I see now that the simpler things in life

25:46.745 --> 25:48.513
are what matter most to me,

25:48.580 --> 25:51.016
like watching it rain

25:51.082 --> 25:54.119
or enjoying the silence of an empty room

25:54.219 --> 25:58.123
or understanding that I don't matter to anybody.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.225
I'm gonna spend the rest of my days enjoying meals

26:00.292 --> 26:03.128
and finding out if I have any children out there.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.796
Thank you so much.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.632
And good luck to us all

26:07.732 --> 26:10.869
in this grand experiment.

26:10.936 --> 26:14.806
Uh, it's so nice out, I think I'll walk.

26:14.906 --> 26:19.244
Thank you so much.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.479
- Oh, my God. You guys made so much.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.582
I'm truly impressed. - Thank you!

26:23.648 --> 26:24.950
Once we figured out the jellybeans,

26:25.050 --> 26:26.818
it was go, go, go.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.254
- Okay.

26:29.321 --> 26:32.490
So it's time to put these two together.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.825
Remember,

26:33.925 --> 26:36.494
if they jiggle, they break.

26:36.595 --> 26:40.465
Any of it splashes out and these chemicals combine,

26:40.565 --> 26:43.768
we're all dead, okay?

26:43.835 --> 26:44.936
- Okay.

26:45.003 --> 26:46.938
- Okay, everybody, grab two bags.

26:47.005 --> 26:49.341
Do not spill. Hostages, you stand together.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.911
And, disciples, do not dillydally.

26:52.978 --> 26:56.181
- Okay, come on, guys. Let's move, please.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.804
- I've got the target.

27:19.871 --> 27:22.307
- Stay close. Stay close. Get back.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.342
- Walter, be careful. She's got enough

27:24.442 --> 27:25.944
ammonium nitrate on her to blow your head off.

27:26.011 --> 27:28.380
- Stand down! Stand down.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.881
- Move.

27:29.981 --> 27:33.151
- Got it. Got it.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.887
Okay?

27:35.987 --> 27:37.489
- Stop.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.860
- Keys to the bus.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.995
There's a plane waiting for you at a private airport.

27:44.062 --> 27:45.497
- Keys first.

27:45.563 --> 27:47.399
Once everyone's on safely, then I'll let them go.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.581
- Move.

28:10.655 --> 28:12.891
Everybody on.

28:16.728 --> 28:18.763
Stop.

28:25.503 --> 28:27.706
- Help my mother!

28:48.593 --> 28:50.195
- Why is it stopped?
