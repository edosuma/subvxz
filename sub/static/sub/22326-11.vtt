for a fair fight today.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.830
Neither am I.

15:24.830 --> 15:26.000
(DEVICE WARBLES)

15:26.000 --> 15:27.670
(BLOW LANDS)
(GRUNTS)

15:27.670 --> 15:29.170
(WHOOSHING)
(BLOWS LANDING)

15:29.170 --> 15:30.880
(GRUNTS) I can't see him.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.000
Scanning.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.710
(BEEPING)

15:47.540 --> 15:49.710
(GROANS)

15:49.710 --> 15:51.330
(GRUNTS)

15:52.080 --> 15:53.710
(GRUNTING)

15:56.960 --> 15:58.790
(SNARLING)

15:58.790 --> 15:59.620
Dume.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.960
That was my master's name.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.290
What do you
want from me?

16:07.290 --> 16:09.000
You

16:09.000 --> 16:11.670
ran.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.670
Yeah, the wolves
were chasing me!

16:14.500 --> 16:17.170
Why?

16:17.170 --> 16:18.960
(STAMMERING)
I didn't mean to run,

16:18.960 --> 16:21.960
I just... I feel lost
without my master.

16:23.620 --> 16:25.830
He was wise

16:25.830 --> 16:27.460
and brave.

16:27.460 --> 16:29.830
And he cared.

16:29.830 --> 16:32.750
He was there for me
when no one else was.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.500
There was so much more
I needed to learn from him.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.670
(EXHALES)

16:37.670 --> 16:39.880
Fear.

16:39.880 --> 16:42.080
I am afraid!
All right?

16:42.080 --> 16:44.250
I'm afraid.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.460
Everything seems
so hopeless now.

16:46.460 --> 16:48.460
(EXHALES)

16:48.750 --> 16:51.170
Fight.

16:51.170 --> 16:52.420
How?

16:52.960 --> 16:55.290
Together.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.790
(WOLF SNARLING)

16:59.330 --> 17:01.040
(GROWLS)

17:01.040 --> 17:02.080
(STONE CLANKS)

17:11.080 --> 17:12.620
This stone.

17:12.620 --> 17:14.960
Where's it from?

17:14.960 --> 17:17.040
Jedi...

17:17.790 --> 17:19.540
Temple.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.710
(BLOW LANDS)

17:29.710 --> 17:31.120
(WHOOSHING)

17:31.120 --> 17:33.920
(GRUNTING)

17:46.620 --> 17:47.750
(BEEPS)

17:47.750 --> 17:49.830
(WHIRRING)

17:54.250 --> 17:56.000
Can you see him now?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.880
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, yeah.

18:01.620 --> 18:03.210
(RUKH GROANS)

18:03.210 --> 18:04.790
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)

18:04.790 --> 18:07.750
(GRUNTING)

18:09.460 --> 18:11.710
(GRUNTING)
This... Is...
Zeb, stop!

18:11.710 --> 18:13.790
For... Kanan!

18:14.880 --> 18:16.420
(PANTING)

18:16.420 --> 18:18.080
Zeb, Zeb! Stop!

18:18.080 --> 18:20.210
I thought you
wanted to get even.

18:20.210 --> 18:23.920
I do, but this
isn't how we do it.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.420
But what are we
gonna do with him now?

18:28.580 --> 18:30.420
I've got an idea.

18:34.710 --> 18:37.960
We accidentally led
the Empire to the Jedi temple.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.420
We escaped,
but they captured it.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.000
Danger.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.880
Well, then the Empire's
still there!

18:45.880 --> 18:48.830
Secrets

18:48.830 --> 18:51.080
within.

18:51.080 --> 18:54.250
Secrets?
What secrets?

18:54.250 --> 18:56.420
What else
is inside the temple?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.710
Knowledge.

19:00.670 --> 19:03.620
Destruction.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.710
Ahsoka said
we'd find knowledge

19:05.710 --> 19:08.210
in the Sith temple
on Malachor.

19:08.210 --> 19:10.210
But we were wrong.

19:10.210 --> 19:12.710
That's when
everything changed.

19:13.670 --> 19:16.000
Restore...
(BARKS)

19:16.000 --> 19:17.960
Past.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.290
Redeem...

19:20.290 --> 19:21.710
Future.

19:21.710 --> 19:24.330
How?
How do I do this?

19:27.620 --> 19:28.920
Tell me.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.170
(SNARLING)

19:32.170 --> 19:33.540
No, no.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.620
(ROARS)

19:34.620 --> 19:36.080
Kanan!

19:36.080 --> 19:38.080
(WIND WHISTLING)

19:53.080 --> 19:55.620
I always liked your art.

19:55.620 --> 19:56.670
Thanks.
(ENGINES WHIRRING)

19:56.670 --> 19:58.210
I think this is
the best message

19:58.210 --> 20:00.460
we can send to
the Empire right now.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.120
Hey, you set
the homing beacon, right?

20:02.120 --> 20:05.040
Yeah.
Well, I think I did.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.790
Zeb.
No, I did.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.790
I did.
Unbelievable.

20:09.790 --> 20:11.620
Did you just see how much
I worked on that thing?

20:15.250 --> 20:16.710
For Kanan,

20:16.710 --> 20:18.750
so he'll always
be remembered

20:18.750 --> 20:20.830
as a part of my family.

20:22.210 --> 20:23.580
You know, Chop,

20:23.580 --> 20:26.710
despite all his misgivings
about the rebellion,

20:26.710 --> 20:29.750
he always believed
we could change things.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.620
(GRUNTING)

20:32.620 --> 20:34.960
That's what
I'll miss the most,

20:34.960 --> 20:37.210
that when none of us
could find the answer,

20:37.210 --> 20:39.830
Kanan could,

20:39.830 --> 20:42.920
and always in
the most unexpected way.

20:45.580 --> 20:47.750
Hera? Hera?

20:49.790 --> 20:51.830
Was your mission
a success?

20:51.830 --> 20:54.960
No, but yours was.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.170
The TIE defender factories
have shut down.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.670
We didn't fail, Hera.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.460
Kanan made sure of it.

21:04.460 --> 21:05.960
In their attempt
to destroy us,

21:05.960 --> 21:08.710
the Empire blew up
their own refinery.

21:08.710 --> 21:11.000
They have no fuel
for the factories.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.620
Their entire production line
has stopped.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.830
Then we have a chance.

21:16.830 --> 21:19.420
We can still beat them.

21:19.420 --> 21:21.710
EZRA: And I know what
our first mission is.

21:22.670 --> 21:25.170
The Jedi temple
is in danger.

21:25.170 --> 21:27.540
And we're the only ones
who can do anything about it.
