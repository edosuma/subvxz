02:16.191 --> 02:17.273
- You want to?

02:17.274 --> 02:19.465
I got this from my uncle,
he was a cardholder.

02:19.466 --> 02:22.397
I think it's from a science
experiment, it's killer.

02:22.398 --> 02:25.808
- Stop talking about it
and put it in the pipe.

02:25.809 --> 02:27.680
- Tommy.
- Yeah, hun.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.187
- Why don't we go to the
Cougar Bar for dinner?

02:30.188 --> 02:31.185
- I don't know.

02:31.186 --> 02:33.064
Cougar's quite a bit a
ways past Tyler's Gulch,

02:33.065 --> 02:34.566
and I got this fire going

02:34.567 --> 02:36.544
and got all that
meat in the cooler.

02:36.545 --> 02:38.454
Besides, I'm kinda getting
used to this country living.

02:38.455 --> 02:40.726
- Yeah, you know, it's not
all just a roll in the hay

02:40.727 --> 02:43.564
under the stars, there's
actual work involved.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.544
- Whoa, did you see that?

02:46.545 --> 02:48.800
- Yeah, pretty impressive.

02:48.801 --> 02:49.802
- Let's go check it out.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.664
- No, it'll be dark soon.

02:51.665 --> 02:53.056
It'll still be there
in the morning.

02:53.057 --> 02:55.600
- Maybe it's an
alien spacecraft.

02:55.601 --> 02:57.221
- Okay, now I know you're crazy.

02:57.222 --> 03:01.055
Have you not ever seen a
shooting star before?

03:03.960 --> 03:05.824
- You ready for this?

03:05.825 --> 03:06.825
- You know it.

03:23.795 --> 03:25.154
- Yeah, baby!

03:25.155 --> 03:26.271
- Ready?
- Yeah!

03:26.272 --> 03:28.292
- Let's go!

03:29.205 --> 03:30.038
- You coming?

03:30.039 --> 03:34.205
- No way, I'm not
going in there.

03:36.501 --> 03:38.668
- Come on in, you chicken!

03:45.101 --> 03:46.197
- Reid?

03:46.198 --> 03:48.399
Reid, get out of the water!

03:48.400 --> 03:49.233
- Come whenever, come on.

03:49.234 --> 03:52.173
- No, seriously, get
out of the water!

03:54.383 --> 03:58.619
No, I'm being serious, Reid,
get out of the water!

03:58.620 --> 03:59.620
Oh my God.

04:00.838 --> 04:01.838
- Come on!

04:31.126 --> 04:32.459
- Damn chainsaw.

04:45.629 --> 04:48.629
What the hell is
going on out there?

04:54.827 --> 04:55.827
Peggy Sue!

04:56.727 --> 04:58.727
What are you barking at?

05:02.439 --> 05:03.439
Shut up!

05:09.623 --> 05:10.623
Stupid dog.

05:12.346 --> 05:16.513
Always barking at the squirrels.

05:19.026 --> 05:22.204
Eh, she's a good ol' dog anyway.

05:34.369 --> 05:35.832
- Whoa!

05:35.833 --> 05:37.583
Can you believe this?

05:39.369 --> 05:41.550
- What is this,
what happened here?

05:41.551 --> 05:44.848
- You weren't kidding, that's
one serious shooting star!

05:44.849 --> 05:46.589
It's all busted
into little pieces.

05:46.590 --> 05:49.840
- Everything, we will destroy.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.524
- It's still warm.

05:53.525 --> 05:55.353
- Honey, I don't think
you should pick that up.

05:55.354 --> 05:56.651
- Eh, what's the harm.

05:56.652 --> 05:58.204
- No, what if it's radioactive

05:58.205 --> 06:00.288
or it's got space
germs or something?

06:00.289 --> 06:01.870
- You're always talking crazy.

06:01.871 --> 06:04.052
- I'm just saying you don't
know where that thing's been.

06:04.053 --> 06:05.929
- You crack me up sometimes.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.796
- Look, let's just drive
back to Tyler's Gulch

06:07.797 --> 06:09.630
and we'll report it.

06:09.631 --> 06:11.067
- Well what's the rush?

06:11.068 --> 06:12.453
- Well, it's creepy.

07:27.903 --> 07:29.693
- I thought we didn't
have to do group

07:29.694 --> 07:30.527
on this trip?

07:30.528 --> 07:31.684
This sucks.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.403
- Give us a break, man.

07:33.404 --> 07:37.002
- Hey, I've got things I'd
like to be doing myself.

07:37.003 --> 07:39.975
We've got rules, you know.

07:39.976 --> 07:41.224
- Nobody's out here.

07:41.225 --> 07:43.644
We should be able to
do whatever we want.

07:43.645 --> 07:46.476
- Yeah, I blow this off and
one of you jerks rats me out.

07:46.477 --> 07:48.172
Isn't that how
things usually work?

07:48.173 --> 07:49.832
- I ain't saying nothing.

07:49.833 --> 07:53.267
- Like you did with those
cellphone photos I took of you?

07:53.268 --> 07:55.656
- Your pictures sucked, man.

07:55.657 --> 07:57.173
I didn't want you to have those.

07:57.174 --> 07:58.673
I turned all that lot away.

07:58.674 --> 08:01.827
- The song and dance I had to
do to get out of that one.

08:01.828 --> 08:03.078
- What picture?

08:05.554 --> 08:09.222
- Don't worry about it, babe.

08:09.223 --> 08:10.352
- Shelly.

08:10.353 --> 08:11.353
Your turn.

08:12.231 --> 08:13.481
- I don't know.

08:14.391 --> 08:17.134
I stopped growing
in the sixth grade.

08:17.135 --> 08:18.412
- And what about you, Chester?

08:18.413 --> 08:21.192
- I actually thought about
this a lot on the way up here,

08:21.193 --> 08:23.208
and, I don't know,

08:23.209 --> 08:27.376
it's kinda like we all have
to pitch in to survive.

08:28.253 --> 08:29.974
My mom told me once in
the first grade that...

08:29.975 --> 08:32.294
- Don't start with
the mom crap again.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.513
- Can it, Larry.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.553
- Everybody has to
move on at some point.

08:37.554 --> 08:39.174
Ain't that right, Christy?

08:39.174 --> 08:40.947
- I was done anyways.

08:40.948 --> 08:41.948
- Okay.

08:42.631 --> 08:44.454
Thanks for sharing.

08:44.455 --> 08:46.038
Let's hit the road.

09:53.972 --> 09:55.639
- Do you mind?

09:56.570 --> 09:57.570
- Oh, yeah.

10:00.111 --> 10:02.851
Would be a lot easier if you'd
let me smoke in the car.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.449
- Hotel's just up the street.

10:30.852 --> 10:31.867
- More coffee, Jim?

10:31.868 --> 10:33.368
- Yeah, thank you.

10:39.988 --> 10:42.286
- So, you're gonna take the
boat out this weekend?

10:42.287 --> 10:44.627
- Yeah, if I get through
some of this paperwork.

10:44.628 --> 10:45.865
- Then you should, you
should go out there

10:45.866 --> 10:47.668
and enjoy the weather.

10:47.669 --> 10:49.086
- I think I will.

11:04.084 --> 11:05.705
- Hello!

11:05.706 --> 11:07.683
What can I do for ya?

11:07.684 --> 11:11.662
- Sign at the motel
said to check in here.

11:11.663 --> 11:12.803
- One room or two?

11:12.804 --> 11:13.686
- Two.

11:13.686 --> 11:14.686
- Alright.

11:16.470 --> 11:18.303
Fill these out for me.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.124
- Can you give us directions

11:23.125 --> 11:25.792
to a place called Shaman's Pass?

11:26.645 --> 11:29.769
- Well if you're camping, honey,
why're you renting rooms?

11:29.770 --> 11:31.871
- It's more like a day job.

11:31.872 --> 11:34.339
We're from the
university up north.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.090
We're doing research.

11:38.326 --> 11:40.677
- Well, Shaman's Pass is
a little tricky to find

11:40.678 --> 11:43.845
if you're not from
around these parts.

11:44.820 --> 11:47.027
You know who you wanna talk to?

11:47.028 --> 11:49.016
See this guy over here?

11:49.017 --> 11:51.037
He'll get you there.

11:51.038 --> 11:52.371
So, Ms. Lambert?

11:53.837 --> 11:55.299
- You can call me Edith.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.300
- Alright.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.563
You're in room 102.

11:59.745 --> 12:01.061
And...

12:01.062 --> 12:02.062
- Heath.

12:04.481 --> 12:06.231
- You're in room 104.

12:10.561 --> 12:11.394
- Thank you.

12:11.395 --> 12:12.977
- And I'm Dani.

12:12.978 --> 12:16.978
I'm always around, if
there's anything you need.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.684
- Why everything
has to be broken?

12:42.685 --> 12:44.602
How did these get bent?

12:47.135 --> 12:50.052
Good God.

12:55.415 --> 12:57.937
Everything's falling apart.

12:57.938 --> 13:01.605
I spend all my time
fiddling with this crap.

13:03.498 --> 13:04.498
How is that?

13:09.426 --> 13:10.516
Ah, bent.

13:10.517 --> 13:11.517
Always bent.

14:12.058 --> 14:13.058
Chester.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.487
Don't even think about it.

14:37.946 --> 14:39.363
- Come on, start.

14:44.037 --> 14:47.275
Oh, damn tractor, I
just put gas in you,

14:47.276 --> 14:48.443
last week, oh!

15:15.513 --> 15:19.993
- Do you guys have any socks
or underwear or anything?

15:19.994 --> 15:23.327
- No, we don't carry
anything like that.

15:25.095 --> 15:29.012
- Do you know what
size bra I wear?

15:33.735 --> 15:36.521
- I don't mind leading
you guys up there.

15:36.522 --> 15:38.980
I need to get back to the
station pretty quick, though.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.148
- We really appreciate it.

15:42.378 --> 15:44.239
- Why you so interested anyway?

15:44.240 --> 15:47.735
I mean, don't these things hit
the atmosphere all the time?

15:47.736 --> 15:49.939
- Most burn up when they enter
the Earth's atmosphere.

15:49.940 --> 15:51.092
Due to the apparent
size of this one,

15:51.093 --> 15:53.480
we were hoping to find
an intact meteorite.

15:53.481 --> 15:54.777
I saw one in the museum once.

15:54.778 --> 15:57.195
Strange-looking hunk of rock.

15:58.247 --> 16:01.664
Makes you wonder what's
really out there.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.060
- Can I get you
guys anything else?

16:05.061 --> 16:06.660
- I think we're fine, darling.

16:06.661 --> 16:07.894
You guys want something?

16:07.895 --> 16:09.228
- Nah, I'm fine.

16:11.298 --> 16:12.965
- Thanks.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.541
- I remember reading about
a dog being killed by one.

16:17.542 --> 16:19.221
Can you imagine that?

16:19.222 --> 16:20.299
A piece of rock
falling from the sky

16:20.300 --> 16:22.936
and just kills the poor critter.

16:22.937 --> 16:26.471
- Where can we grab
some lunch around here?

16:26.472 --> 16:29.760
- There's a diner up the
street on the right-hand side,

16:29.761 --> 16:31.261
you can't miss it.

16:33.416 --> 16:34.853
- I'm gonna be in the truck.

16:34.854 --> 16:36.521
Hurry it up in here.

16:53.556 --> 16:55.520
- How you doing?

16:55.521 --> 16:56.996
- How's everybody doing today?

16:56.997 --> 16:59.141
- Excellent, we're just
here to get some lunch.

16:59.142 --> 17:00.840
- Alright, right this way.

17:00.841 --> 17:02.234
- Come on then, go on, go on.

17:02.235 --> 17:03.568
Go eat, come on.

17:06.598 --> 17:08.779
- We better head up there.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.356
- Do you guys have a
bathroom in here?

17:23.357 --> 17:26.607
- Yeah, it's right
down that hall, hun.

17:43.193 --> 17:46.057
- I'm already getting tired
of the mountains, dude.

17:46.058 --> 17:49.808
I really hope the food
here doesn't suck too.

17:54.096 --> 17:57.263
- You really need to
learn everything.

18:03.759 --> 18:05.839
♪ I'm so lonely, baby ♪

18:05.840 --> 18:08.437
♪ I'm so lonely ♪

18:08.438 --> 18:12.605
♪ Well I'm so lonely,
I could die ♪

18:16.496 --> 18:20.413
♪ You still can find some room ♪

18:26.640 --> 18:30.274
- Not gonna tell on me
or anything, are you?

18:30.275 --> 18:33.154
- Not unless there's
some for the both of us.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.746
- Help yourself.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.747
- Thanks.

18:42.435 --> 18:44.530
So what kind of
liquor did you get?

18:44.531 --> 18:45.531
- 151.

18:46.696 --> 18:49.533
- That'll get the job done.

18:49.534 --> 18:52.493
So, what do you think
of that Chester guy?

18:52.494 --> 18:54.173
- The glue sniffer?

18:54.174 --> 18:56.431
- Yeah.

18:56.432 --> 19:00.265
- Just my type.

19:05.954 --> 19:08.311
- Ugh, sometimes I wonder
what you just got going on

19:08.312 --> 19:11.314
inside your little ol' head.

19:11.315 --> 19:14.914
My God, that was just a
guy from the Census.

19:14.915 --> 19:17.031
They're just trying
to count heads.

19:17.032 --> 19:19.373
They don't care about that
corn liquor we got brewing

19:19.374 --> 19:21.207
out there in the shed.

19:25.467 --> 19:27.467
Are you listening to me?

19:35.044 --> 19:36.211
Uh, Peggy Sue?

19:38.776 --> 19:40.276
Get over here now.

19:42.776 --> 19:43.776
Peggy Sue.

19:46.579 --> 19:47.917
Peggy Sue!

19:47.918 --> 19:48.918
Yeesh!

20:19.351 --> 20:20.350
- This is it.

20:20.351 --> 20:22.029
Shaman's Pass, about
a mile up the road

20:22.030 --> 20:23.789
and make a right
before you get there.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.029
- Yeah, there,
through the brush?

20:26.030 --> 20:27.511
- Will you be okay
finding your way back?

20:27.512 --> 20:28.828
- Yeah, we'll be fine.

20:39.811 --> 20:41.693
- What were you doing in there?

20:41.694 --> 20:42.694
- Nothing.

20:47.134 --> 20:49.431
- You know, I could see
myself living in the country.

20:49.432 --> 20:50.850
What do you say I
sneak back into town

20:50.851 --> 20:53.773
once I put the kiddies to bed.

20:53.774 --> 20:57.693
Maybe you and I could grab
a drink, or something?

20:57.694 --> 20:58.691
- Mm.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.524
- Dani.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.769
Have you seen Big Jim?

21:01.770 --> 21:03.513
- He was in here just a bit ago.

21:03.514 --> 21:04.627
- Well where the hell is he?

21:04.628 --> 21:06.967
We've got monsters out
there on the loose.

21:06.968 --> 21:07.971
- Monster?

21:07.972 --> 21:10.013
What do you mean, monster?

21:10.014 --> 21:12.809
- They ate my Peggy Sue.

21:12.810 --> 21:14.069
- Oh my God.

21:14.070 --> 21:16.791
- It's like a big
worm with teeth!

21:16.792 --> 21:18.110
- Rance.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.796
It might be a good idea to
hang off the moonshine.

21:20.797 --> 21:25.292
- Oh Dani, it ain't got
nothing to do with moonshine!

21:25.293 --> 21:29.116
Hey you, we've got to get the
state troopers or something.

21:29.117 --> 21:30.949
- Well I'd really like
to help you, Pops,

21:30.950 --> 21:32.687
but we've got some
camping to do.

21:32.688 --> 21:33.685
- Camping?

21:33.686 --> 21:35.305
You can't take anybody camping,

21:35.306 --> 21:37.556
there's monsters out there.

21:38.842 --> 21:40.563
- It's okay.

21:40.564 --> 21:42.964
- They ate my dog, didn't
you hear anything?

21:42.965 --> 21:44.645
- I have monster repellent!

21:44.646 --> 21:45.979
- You damn fool!

21:47.404 --> 21:48.805
- We'll be fine.

21:48.806 --> 21:50.482
- You're not gonna be fine.

21:50.483 --> 21:53.563
- Hey, just lay off
the moonshine a bit.

21:53.564 --> 21:55.231
We'll be fine, okay?

22:00.102 --> 22:02.258
- I gotta do something, Dani.

22:02.259 --> 22:05.744
They ate my dog, they
ate old Peggy Sue.

22:05.745 --> 22:07.203
- Hey, let's go!

22:21.888 --> 22:25.063
- It was much bigger than
I would have predicted.

23:16.790 --> 23:18.352
- More water?

23:18.353 --> 23:21.686
- Yeah, that stuff
really hits the spot.

23:23.617 --> 23:24.950
- You want some?

23:27.756 --> 23:30.017
Be that way, bitch.

23:30.018 --> 23:31.018
- Larry!

23:43.361 --> 23:44.778
- Was that a cop?

23:45.801 --> 23:48.864
- Relax, sweet cheeks,
it's just a forest ranger.

23:48.865 --> 23:51.615
- Probably Yogi,
chasing Boo Boo.

24:23.466 --> 24:26.716
- I'm getting some
biological activity.

24:27.581 --> 24:29.137
Look on your computer and
tell me what kind of reading

24:29.138 --> 24:30.638
you're picking up.

24:31.557 --> 24:36.321
It's a really high
concentration of formic acid.

24:36.322 --> 24:39.180
- You think there might be
life where this is from?

24:39.181 --> 24:42.000
- That's a good question.

24:42.001 --> 24:45.041
We need to get some
samples back to the lab.

24:45.042 --> 24:47.517
- You need to get on that.

24:54.417 --> 24:56.198
- Could you stop at
the next gas station?

24:56.199 --> 24:57.740
I gotta pee.

24:57.741 --> 24:59.057
- In case you haven't noticed,

24:59.058 --> 25:00.574
there hasn't been anything
like civilization

25:00.575 --> 25:02.837
since we passed
that trailer park,

25:02.838 --> 25:05.137
if that even counts
as civilization.

25:05.138 --> 25:07.196
- That was like an hour ago.

25:07.197 --> 25:09.355
- So, you have been
paying attention.

25:09.356 --> 25:11.420
Look, we're not gonna
see another gas station

25:11.421 --> 25:13.500
until we're headed back home.

25:13.501 --> 25:14.501
- No way.

25:15.437 --> 25:18.097
You shoulda told me that.

25:18.098 --> 25:21.387
- Yeah, well, I just work here.

25:21.388 --> 25:22.940
- Wow.

25:22.941 --> 25:26.556
This is chock-full of
complex organic compounds.

25:26.557 --> 25:29.536
That can only come from life.

25:29.537 --> 25:30.758
- Yeah, like I said, it could be

25:30.759 --> 25:33.192
some kind of Earthly
contaminant.

25:33.193 --> 25:37.513
- You yourself said you've
never seen anything like that.

25:40.759 --> 25:41.678
Well, a proper lab analysis

25:41.679 --> 25:46.114
of the deuterium-to-hydrogen
ratio should give us that.

25:46.115 --> 25:50.632
Could an alien life form
have hitched a ride here?

25:50.633 --> 25:52.716
- Transpermia hypothesis?

25:54.035 --> 25:56.178
It's not likely any
life form could survive

25:56.179 --> 25:57.768
the hazard journey
through space.

25:57.769 --> 26:00.257
- Not if the rock acted
as an insulator.

26:00.258 --> 26:01.634
How do you explain
freshly-fallen meteorites

26:01.635 --> 26:04.098
with a layer of
frost around them?

26:04.099 --> 26:06.258
In theory, an organism
could survive,

26:06.259 --> 26:09.676
and that mucus could
be from one of them.

26:11.447 --> 26:14.614
- Yeah, but theories
are dime a dozen.

26:19.859 --> 26:22.351
- On the other
side of the world,

26:22.352 --> 26:23.716
another air incident;
ABC's Gail McCarthy

26:23.717 --> 26:25.329
reports from Saigon.

26:25.330 --> 26:26.832
- Whelan.

26:26.833 --> 26:29.328
- Rance, I didn't expect to
see you for another month.

26:29.329 --> 26:30.393
- I need your help.

26:30.394 --> 26:31.636
- Sure, what do you need?

26:31.637 --> 26:35.716
- There's this great big slug
up at my place, huge thing.

26:35.717 --> 26:37.934
It's bigger than my truck.

26:37.935 --> 26:39.751
- Okay, time to bring out
the heavy artillery, huh?

26:39.752 --> 26:41.774
Snail poison, aisle three.

26:41.775 --> 26:43.616
That ought to do the trick.

26:43.617 --> 26:46.293
- This ain't no
damn garden slug,

26:46.294 --> 26:49.556
this thing is this huge
caterpillar thing.

26:49.557 --> 26:51.140
It's got big teeth!

26:52.773 --> 26:53.773
- Okay.

26:55.275 --> 26:58.194
We've got a bunch of other
concession sides over there.

26:58.195 --> 26:59.856
- You got one of
those pump sprayers?

26:59.857 --> 27:01.376
- Yeah, in the back.

27:01.377 --> 27:02.677
- Your biggest one.

27:02.678 --> 27:04.496
- 40 ounce, I think.

27:04.497 --> 27:07.076
- Well hell, that ain't
gon' do nothing!

27:07.077 --> 27:10.494
No, you got one of
those gas compressors?

27:12.598 --> 27:14.554
- Rance, how big
are these things?

27:14.555 --> 27:17.512
- Man, I told you this
thing's as big as my truck!

27:17.513 --> 27:19.137
It ate my dog!

27:19.138 --> 27:20.805
My little Peggy Sue.

27:22.755 --> 27:25.672
I'm gonna kill that
son of a bitch.

27:26.599 --> 27:28.766
How about that compressor?

27:50.711 --> 27:51.711
- Hey, baby.

27:53.197 --> 27:54.530
What's going on?

27:56.635 --> 27:57.635
What?

27:58.717 --> 28:00.555
She said what?

28:04.314 --> 28:07.777
I was out shooting ball with
the fellas the other night.

28:07.778 --> 28:10.611
Come on baby, don't
listen to her!

28:18.913 --> 28:20.580
That is not my baby.

28:43.619 --> 28:44.619
- What?

28:45.459 --> 28:47.292
- The chair goes here.

28:48.792 --> 28:52.375
- That's too bad.

28:58.257 --> 28:59.550
- Come on, chop chop,

28:59.551 --> 29:01.464
let's get this campsite set up.

29:01.465 --> 29:02.465
Christina!

29:03.139 --> 29:06.797
- Okay, I think what
we came here for.

29:06.798 --> 29:08.674
Let's wrap it up.

29:53.912 --> 29:55.760
- Oh, man, no!

29:55.761 --> 29:56.761
Oh, man!

30:24.169 --> 30:25.357
- This is it?

30:25.358 --> 30:28.441
Sitting here watching
you do nothing?

30:29.289 --> 30:31.372
- I am not doing nothing.

30:44.491 --> 30:46.429
- Couldn't we be doing
this at the house?

30:46.430 --> 30:49.645
- You're missing the point.

30:49.646 --> 30:52.180
Look, this experience
is supposed to be

30:52.181 --> 30:55.464
about making you
guys work together,

30:55.465 --> 30:59.666
in an effort to develop social
skills and self-confidence,

30:59.667 --> 31:03.823
through getting you out of
your comfort zone and creating

31:03.824 --> 31:07.448
physically-and emotionally-challenging
circumstances,

31:07.449 --> 31:11.616
which develop your problem-solving
and coping strategies.

31:15.086 --> 31:18.400
At least that's what
the guidelines say.

31:21.404 --> 31:24.322
- Do the guidelines
say you're a tool?

31:24.323 --> 31:25.920
- Grow up, Larry.

31:25.921 --> 31:27.559
Grow up.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.762
- Sounds like a bunch
of psychobabble to me.

31:30.763 --> 31:33.860
- Look, I didn't say
I bought into it,

31:33.861 --> 31:37.619
I'm just telling you that
that's part of the program.

31:37.620 --> 31:41.863
- She used to live out
in these very woods.

31:41.864 --> 31:46.718
In a little cottage not far
from where we are right now.

31:46.719 --> 31:49.719
She peddled tonics,
herbal remedies,

31:52.070 --> 31:55.782
and everyone in town could
swear the old hag was a witch.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.182
- Yeah?

31:59.183 --> 32:01.433
Well, I gotta tap a kidney.

32:12.918 --> 32:15.680
- Then the town's little
girls started going missing,

32:15.681 --> 32:16.681
one by one.

32:19.460 --> 32:22.960
Try as they might, they
could not find them.

32:22.961 --> 32:25.781
And they searched everywhere.

32:25.782 --> 32:29.949
In the houses, the barns,
the fields, even the woods.

32:33.517 --> 32:34.517
Nothing.

32:36.417 --> 32:40.084
It's as if they just
vanished into thin air.

32:42.822 --> 32:44.300
And although she
denied knowledge

32:44.301 --> 32:46.718
of the girls' disappearances,

32:48.305 --> 32:51.349
the brave souls who questioned
Mary couldn't help but notice

32:51.350 --> 32:54.017
that she looked somehow younger.

32:58.664 --> 33:01.264
Then one faithful night, the
miller's daughter was cast

33:01.265 --> 33:05.432
under a spell, and he followed
her to the witch's cottage,

33:08.397 --> 33:12.564
whereupon he found the bodies
of all the missing girls,

33:14.961 --> 33:17.794
completely drained
of their blood,

33:20.001 --> 33:23.988
the very thing that
restored Mary's youth.

33:23.989 --> 33:27.116
When word got back
to the village,

33:27.117 --> 33:30.867
they banded together and
stormed the cottage.

33:33.041 --> 33:36.144
And as they burned
her at the stake,

33:36.145 --> 33:38.978
she placed a curse
on all of them,

33:41.141 --> 33:45.969
and to this day, they say if
you say her name three times

33:45.970 --> 33:49.303
in the mirror, she'll
appear before you,

33:51.223 --> 33:55.390
right before she rips your
eyes out of the socket.

33:58.318 --> 33:59.318
- Charming.

34:01.302 --> 34:03.635
- I think you should say it.

34:05.061 --> 34:06.311
Are you afraid?

34:07.264 --> 34:08.597
- Of course not.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.382
- Say it.

34:12.090 --> 34:13.580
- Get real.

34:13.581 --> 34:14.581
- Say it!

34:16.744 --> 34:18.494
- You're being silly.

34:19.523 --> 34:20.523
- Say it!

34:30.664 --> 34:31.831
- Bloody Mary.

34:39.168 --> 34:40.168
Bloody Mary.

35:36.445 --> 35:39.423
- Get it off!

36:13.865 --> 36:16.615
- They ate my dog,
old Peggy Sue.

37:13.470 --> 37:14.720
You ate my dog!

37:18.087 --> 37:20.065
Son of a bitch!

37:20.066 --> 37:21.868
Maggot, you!

37:21.869 --> 37:22.869
Ah, gotcha!

37:26.639 --> 37:29.314
They'll believe me now,

37:29.315 --> 37:30.648
that's for sure.

37:41.943 --> 37:43.251
- You gotta apply
pressure on that wound

37:43.252 --> 37:44.282
and stop the bleeding.

37:44.283 --> 37:45.558
Here, breath with me.

37:45.559 --> 37:46.856
- We'll use my sweater.

37:46.857 --> 37:48.274
- Here.

37:49.131 --> 37:51.158
- We'll use my sweater.

37:51.159 --> 37:52.159
Help me.

38:00.149 --> 38:01.818
- What the hell
were those things?

38:01.819 --> 38:03.519
- We can talk about that later.

38:03.520 --> 38:06.937
We gotta get back to
town in the morning.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.975
- Who the hell are you, man?

38:10.976 --> 38:14.318
- The guy that just
saved your life.

38:14.319 --> 38:17.319
Do you even know
where you're going?

38:18.275 --> 38:19.972
- I just wanna go home.

38:19.973 --> 38:21.756
- Look, pull over
after the next turn!

38:26.199 --> 38:30.366
- Now they're gonna
believe me now!

38:51.367 --> 38:52.913
- The wiles of the
Texas Rangers!

38:55.249 --> 38:56.971
- Not to bring up
a sore subject,

38:56.972 --> 38:59.828
other than being the guy who
saved our lives, who are you?

38:59.829 --> 39:03.590
- I came here to investigate
the impact site for a meteor.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.248
I work with the university.

39:05.249 --> 39:08.911
- Those things back there,
what the hell were they?

39:08.912 --> 39:11.965
- I'll have to get back
to you on that one, kid.

39:11.966 --> 39:14.507
- The name's Chester.

39:14.508 --> 39:16.674
- How's she doing?

39:16.675 --> 39:19.360
- I don't know, she's
not saying much.

39:19.361 --> 39:20.870
Shelly?

39:20.871 --> 39:22.848
- Yeah.

39:22.849 --> 39:25.107
- How you doing, babe?

39:25.108 --> 39:26.691
- I've been better.

39:27.550 --> 39:28.706
Where are we?

39:28.707 --> 39:30.790
- We're headed into town.

39:33.196 --> 39:34.768
- These stories based on fact,

39:34.769 --> 39:36.876
and their names, states,
and places are fictitious

39:36.877 --> 39:38.510
for obvious reasons.

39:38.511 --> 39:42.193
The events themselves
are a matter of record.

39:42.194 --> 39:43.852
- Can I tell you something?

39:43.853 --> 39:45.094
- Sure, sweetie.

39:45.095 --> 39:46.614
What is it?

39:46.615 --> 39:49.174
- If you were the
one who's drinking,

39:49.175 --> 39:52.074
why is my stomach killing me?

39:59.353 --> 40:00.378
- Those things have
anything to do

40:00.379 --> 40:03.339
with the meteor you mentioned?

40:03.340 --> 40:07.705
- I'm starting to lean
in that direction, kid.

40:07.706 --> 40:08.706
- Aliens?

40:09.882 --> 40:10.882
- Maybe.

40:12.862 --> 40:14.076
- Cool.

40:14.077 --> 40:16.800
- Those things were
from outer space?

40:16.801 --> 40:19.145
- That's only
speculation right now.

40:19.146 --> 40:22.462
One thing I do know,
wherever they're from,

40:22.463 --> 40:25.081
they've got a taste
for human blood.

40:25.082 --> 40:26.601
- The National
Broadcasting Company

40:26.602 --> 40:31.039
presents Joel McRae in Tales
of the Texas Rangers!

40:42.709 --> 40:44.024
- I got it.

40:44.025 --> 40:45.404
It's at a logging camp.

40:45.405 --> 40:46.406
- Trish, baby?

40:46.407 --> 40:47.407
- Trish?

40:48.749 --> 40:50.364
Baby?

40:50.365 --> 40:52.044
- Just something I got on TV.

40:52.045 --> 40:53.240
Can you get me a beer?

40:53.241 --> 40:54.828
- What am I, a maid?

40:54.829 --> 40:55.946
Get it yourself!

40:55.947 --> 40:57.446
- I don't wanna miss
any of this movie.

40:57.447 --> 41:00.466
This is great, I can't believe
I've never seen this before.

41:05.695 --> 41:08.362
- I want to have an early night.

41:16.827 --> 41:18.601
- Thanks, Trish baby.

41:18.602 --> 41:21.935
- Those people are dead.

41:54.142 --> 41:57.392
- Nothing beats a
good Sasquatch movie.

42:07.101 --> 42:10.184
- Don't forget to
take out the trash.

43:16.099 --> 43:17.221
- As soon as we get into
town, we need to make

43:17.222 --> 43:19.796
some phone calls, call
the army or somebody,

43:19.797 --> 43:23.742
these guys up in the hills
and blow these things out.

43:23.743 --> 43:25.160
Is that the plan?

43:34.901 --> 43:37.960
Why'd they come down
here in the first place?

43:37.961 --> 43:41.001
- Well, they got a
taste for human blood.

43:41.002 --> 43:44.062
Maybe they can smell
it or something.

43:44.063 --> 43:46.478
It's just a couple
blocks to the motel.

43:46.479 --> 43:47.833
- What's there?

43:47.834 --> 43:48.834
- Dani.

43:49.701 --> 43:52.238
- The lady from the diner?

43:52.239 --> 43:54.180
- Yeah, she's the owner.

43:54.181 --> 43:56.558
I gotta make sure she's alright.

43:56.559 --> 43:58.395
- You're crazy, man,
just keep driving!

43:58.396 --> 44:00.878
- Look, we gotta change
vehicles anyway.

44:00.879 --> 44:02.798
Maybe we can use hers.

44:02.799 --> 44:04.278
- It's too dangerous.

44:04.279 --> 44:05.940
We gotta get outta here.

44:05.941 --> 44:09.583
- We'll all get out
of this together.

44:14.899 --> 44:16.691
- Here you go, honey.

44:16.692 --> 44:17.692
- Thank you.

44:21.221 --> 44:22.638
- How's it going?

44:23.872 --> 44:26.633
- You know, I really need
some help at the store,

44:26.634 --> 44:28.302
maybe you can quit
your job at the diner.

44:28.303 --> 44:30.958
- No, you really need
me to keep that job.

44:30.959 --> 44:33.141
Things are tight
enough as it is.

44:39.844 --> 44:43.038
- That didn't sound
like any customer.

44:43.039 --> 44:44.510
Maybe we should call the police.

44:44.511 --> 44:45.881
- Ain't no police for miles,

44:45.882 --> 44:48.022
I can get cleaned out
before they even get here.

44:48.023 --> 44:49.220
- They might have guns!

44:49.221 --> 44:50.442
Wait!

45:02.143 --> 45:05.780
- You guys just gonna
let him do this?

45:05.781 --> 45:06.864
It's suicide.

45:08.442 --> 45:09.598
What the hell is
wrong with you guys,

45:09.599 --> 45:12.260
you don't have the balls
to stand up to this guy?

45:12.261 --> 45:14.398
- I wouldn't go there, Larry.

45:14.399 --> 45:16.580
- What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

45:16.581 --> 45:19.401
- I think you left your
balls at the campsite.

45:19.402 --> 45:21.161
- You don't talk
to me like that.

45:21.162 --> 45:23.912
- Shut up, Larry,
you big whiner!

46:09.921 --> 46:10.921
- Oh, shit!

46:25.061 --> 46:27.978
Where are these
things coming from?

46:40.102 --> 46:41.099
- They're here! They're here!
They're here!

46:41.100 --> 46:42.173
Rance was right!

46:42.174 --> 46:43.403
They're here! They're here!

46:52.982 --> 46:53.982
- Go go go!

47:19.339 --> 47:20.617
- It's not safe!

47:20.618 --> 47:23.340
You gotta come with me!

47:23.341 --> 47:25.178
There's a trail through
the woods to my place!

47:25.179 --> 47:26.899
We gotta go, come on!

48:08.138 --> 48:10.115
- You see anything?

48:10.116 --> 48:11.722
- I can't see any
movement in the dark.

48:11.723 --> 48:13.701
Maybe they're inactive at night.

48:13.702 --> 48:14.821
- Who cares when they're active,

48:14.822 --> 48:18.901
we need to take these things
out and take them out now.

48:18.902 --> 48:20.326
- These things are way too big

48:20.327 --> 48:22.362
to have come here on a meteor!

48:22.363 --> 48:25.460
- Well they've obviously grown
since they've got here.

48:25.461 --> 48:27.802
Maybe something in our
environment serves as a catalyst

48:27.803 --> 48:30.423
and they just grow
exponentially.

48:30.424 --> 48:34.106
You know, like CO2
helps wheat grow?

48:34.107 --> 48:35.857
- Is that you, Daddy?

48:38.920 --> 48:42.298
- We're not talking
about wheat, honey.

48:42.299 --> 48:45.399
- More like maggots on steroids.

48:45.400 --> 48:48.983
- Maybe they got into
some Herakleophorbia.

48:50.914 --> 48:53.644
- You know, I'm not familiar
with that scientific term.

48:53.645 --> 48:54.725
- Just something I read about,

48:54.726 --> 48:57.024
a couple of scientists
put some stuff together,

48:57.025 --> 48:59.868
it makes things go
faster and bigger.

48:59.869 --> 49:02.424
- Oh yeah, HG Wells,
Food of the Gods.

49:02.425 --> 49:04.204
- I saw that movie.

49:04.205 --> 49:06.305
- That's only science fiction.

49:06.306 --> 49:08.587
- I wish those things out there
were just science fiction.

49:13.565 --> 49:14.844
- Well, given their
alien nature,

49:14.845 --> 49:16.508
maybe this rapid
metabolic growth rate

49:16.509 --> 49:19.787
is apart of their normal cycle.

49:19.788 --> 49:23.324
- That still doesn't
get us out of here.

49:23.325 --> 49:26.388
- Okay, if their metabolic
cycle is that fast,

49:26.389 --> 49:29.926
then maybe their
life is shortened?

49:29.927 --> 49:32.410
- That's possible.

49:32.411 --> 49:35.265
- No, I mean shortened,
like way short.

49:35.266 --> 49:37.266
Enough to wait them out.

49:38.285 --> 49:40.865
- Like the mayfly.
- Yeah.

49:40.866 --> 49:42.348
- Listen to this.

49:42.349 --> 49:45.084
We spent a spring
once in Buffalo,

49:45.085 --> 49:47.740
and those things
were everywhere,

49:47.741 --> 49:50.401
and then they just disappeared.

49:50.402 --> 49:53.766
It's like they hatch, and
they're everywhere you can see,

49:53.767 --> 49:55.404
and then they're gone.

49:55.405 --> 49:58.344
In fact, the locals,
they call them dayflies.

49:58.345 --> 49:59.367
It's really weird.

50:01.629 --> 50:02.629
- Dayfly.

50:04.167 --> 50:06.482
Daddy, I want a dayfly.

50:14.685 --> 50:16.602
- What do you mean, we?

50:18.567 --> 50:20.150
- My husband and I.

50:21.062 --> 50:22.604
- Husband?

50:22.605 --> 50:23.605
- Yeah. Ben.

50:27.127 --> 50:29.627
He died in a car crash in '97.

50:30.865 --> 50:32.764
- I'm sorry to hear that.

50:32.765 --> 50:34.848
- Oh yeah, I'm sorry too.

50:36.285 --> 50:38.006
We have giant worms chasing us

50:38.007 --> 50:40.886
and you guys are talking
about dead husbands?

50:40.887 --> 50:41.760
I don't know if you remember,

50:41.761 --> 50:44.262
but we have bigger
problems to deal with.

50:44.263 --> 50:48.843
- So, wait, these things could
be dead in the morning?

50:54.964 --> 50:57.958
- That girl in there
needs hospitalization.

50:57.959 --> 51:00.422
- I'm well aware of that.

51:00.423 --> 51:03.905
- You know, I go to that
diner every damn day.

51:03.906 --> 51:05.406
That's all I know.

51:06.599 --> 51:08.305
I just always had felt like
there's something more

51:08.306 --> 51:12.086
out there, I don't know what,
but just something more.

51:12.087 --> 51:14.170
Is it all gonna end here?

51:15.245 --> 51:18.563
- Maybe we have a
bigger purpose here.

51:18.564 --> 51:19.897
- Yeah, tell me.

51:21.207 --> 51:22.874
- Saving those kids?

51:23.943 --> 51:25.185
- Do you really think that
they could just die off

51:25.186 --> 51:26.686
like Chester said?

51:28.726 --> 51:30.559
- Anything's possible.

51:32.386 --> 51:34.630
Do you see this? - What?

51:34.631 --> 51:36.126
- It's worse than we thought.

51:38.304 --> 51:39.940
More than one.

51:39.941 --> 51:42.060
- I can see that.

51:42.061 --> 51:44.045
These things are gonna
pose greater threat

51:44.046 --> 51:46.720
than we ever even thought.

51:46.721 --> 51:50.365
- I'm almost afraid
to do the math.

51:50.366 --> 51:52.203
You don't suppose an arrow
dipped in rat poison

51:52.204 --> 51:54.480
would do the trick?

51:54.481 --> 51:56.539
- Well, if you had a
lot of rat poison,

51:56.540 --> 51:58.640
and a whole battalion
of archers,

51:58.641 --> 52:00.416
and that's if rat poison
even has a toxic effect

52:00.417 --> 52:02.084
on their metabolism.

52:03.383 --> 52:05.483
- Flaming arrows?

52:05.484 --> 52:07.484
- Yeah, that could work.

52:08.423 --> 52:09.979
How many arrows do you have?

52:09.980 --> 52:11.813
- How many do we need?

52:15.143 --> 52:16.143
- I'm wrong.

52:18.124 --> 52:21.541
I'm wrong, he always
told me I was wrong.

52:26.183 --> 52:28.850
Oh God.

52:32.862 --> 52:34.696
- Shelly, wake up.

52:34.697 --> 52:35.697
Shelly.

52:36.965 --> 52:38.298
Shelly, wake up!

52:39.187 --> 52:40.543
Wake up!

52:54.168 --> 52:56.348
- I don't know what
the big deal is.

52:56.349 --> 52:58.585
She was already dead.

52:58.586 --> 53:01.148
That creature ate her stomach.

53:01.149 --> 53:02.467
Let's be honest.

53:02.468 --> 53:07.144
We were just waiting for
her to stop breathing.

53:07.145 --> 53:08.562
- Shut up, Larry!

53:10.084 --> 53:12.823
- Get outta here, Larry!

53:12.824 --> 53:15.758
- Already proved that you
don't have a backbone!

53:15.759 --> 53:17.027
- Backbone?

53:17.028 --> 53:18.388
I'll show you backbone!

53:30.388 --> 53:32.483
- We still gonna do this?

53:32.484 --> 53:33.567
- We have to.

53:35.413 --> 53:36.413
- Come on.

54:01.809 --> 54:02.809
- Heath?

54:04.280 --> 54:06.400
They're moving! Heath!

54:06.401 --> 54:07.863
They're moving around up there!

54:07.864 --> 54:08.861
Heath!

54:08.862 --> 54:11.111
Look, we gotta go, come on!

54:12.439 --> 54:13.820
Wake up, we gotta go.

54:13.821 --> 54:14.821
We gotta go!

54:20.520 --> 54:21.353
Come on!

54:21.354 --> 54:22.853
Come on, you guys!

55:24.889 --> 55:25.890
- Come on!

55:25.891 --> 55:26.891
Come on!

55:55.811 --> 55:56.811
- Get back!

55:58.635 --> 55:59.635
Chester!

56:03.927 --> 56:05.035
- Thanks for the help.

56:05.036 --> 56:06.036
- Anytime!

56:06.988 --> 56:09.368
- What are you guys
doing, let's go!

56:09.369 --> 56:11.472
- Come on.

56:49.352 --> 56:52.102
- They're everywhere!

57:00.557 --> 57:02.307
- Christina, come on!

57:42.893 --> 57:43.893
Come on!

57:45.555 --> 57:47.628
Are you kidding me?

57:47.629 --> 57:48.616
- Chester!

57:48.617 --> 57:51.949
Does it look like I've
done this before?

58:10.309 --> 58:12.056
- I'm back!

58:12.057 --> 58:13.974
With a little backbone.

01:00:07.209 --> 01:00:08.209
- Let's go!

01:00:32.005 --> 01:00:34.425
- Larry, what are we doing?

01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:37.885
- I don't know, man, I've just
been killing giant maggots!

01:00:37.886 --> 01:00:40.068
- Well shouldn't we have
a plan or something?

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:41.066
- A plan?

01:00:41.067 --> 01:00:42.068
What kind of a plan can we make

01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:45.281
with these gross things
trying to eat us?

01:00:45.282 --> 01:00:47.428
- We should go back to
the old gas station.

01:00:47.429 --> 01:00:48.426
- Okay, but what's
the difference

01:00:48.427 --> 01:00:50.607
between being here and there?

01:00:50.608 --> 01:00:52.628
- Well, there's
gas things there.

01:00:52.629 --> 01:00:54.447
Maybe we can lure
theme over there.

01:00:54.448 --> 01:00:55.522
What about flaming arrows?

01:00:55.523 --> 01:00:57.284
Dani and Heath thought
it would work.

01:00:57.285 --> 01:00:58.285
- Yeah.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.628
- We could blow the
whole place up.

01:01:00.629 --> 01:01:05.229
- I don't think I'm good enough
to shoot flaming arrows.

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:06.435
- Damn, babe.

01:01:06.436 --> 01:01:10.603
From what I saw earlier, you
were looking pretty good.

01:01:12.244 --> 01:01:16.441
- We still have that bottle
of 151 in the truck.

01:01:16.442 --> 01:01:19.204
- I don't think right now is
a good time to be drinking.

01:01:19.205 --> 01:01:21.481
- We could make fiery cocktails,

01:01:21.482 --> 01:01:23.465
and I still have that glue.

01:01:23.466 --> 01:01:25.027
- Well, this all sounds
like a great plan,

01:01:25.028 --> 01:01:27.908
but has anybody checked a phone?

01:01:27.909 --> 01:01:30.147
To see if we have service?

01:01:30.148 --> 01:01:32.047
To call for help?

01:01:32.048 --> 01:01:34.468
- I coulda told you
there was no service.

01:01:34.469 --> 01:01:36.447
With this longitude
and latitude,

01:01:36.448 --> 01:01:38.083
and the altitude of
these mountains,

01:01:38.084 --> 01:01:40.167
the service gets diluted.

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:43.283
And besides, you
can't bounce signal

01:01:43.284 --> 01:01:47.017
through the microwave
belt around the Earth.

01:01:47.018 --> 01:01:48.884
- I'm so glad you're back.

01:01:48.885 --> 01:01:52.135
I was afraid something
happened to you.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.141
- Did you guys see the
last one I took out?

01:03:27.142 --> 01:03:29.679
I blasted his green
guts everywhere!

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.941
- Yeah man, I thought
it had you for sure!

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:33.377
- Are you guys kidding me?

01:03:33.378 --> 01:03:37.519
This isn't a video game, those
things are trying to eat us!

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.922
- Nah, I could take
these things off

01:03:38.923 --> 01:03:41.802
like fish out of a barrel.

01:03:41.803 --> 01:03:44.601
- Reminds me of that game,
Giant Space Slugs From Saturn,

01:03:44.602 --> 01:03:47.359
where that Latin dude becomes
the hero, like Clark Kent

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.527
in Superman, but ends up saving
Gotham City like Batman.

01:03:52.683 --> 01:03:55.779
- Nah, I think it was the
White guy dressed like Rambo!

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.280
- No, I think it was more like

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.343
the Valley girl turned Elektra.

01:04:06.186 --> 01:04:08.936
After all, it is
a woman's world.

01:04:12.522 --> 01:04:14.038
Hey!

01:04:15.728 --> 01:04:16.598
- Holy shit!

01:04:16.599 --> 01:04:17.947
Get those flaming arrows ready!

01:04:30.632 --> 01:04:33.614
- Christina, take
your shirt off.

01:04:36.627 --> 01:04:38.544
For the flaming arrows!

01:04:39.672 --> 01:04:41.339
- I've got the glue!

01:09:08.518 --> 01:09:11.803
- Now that's what you
call a fiery cocktail.

01:09:13.707 --> 01:09:14.858
- Looks like they're
gonna have something new

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:17.759
on the local diner's menu.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.015
Barbecue maggot steaks.

01:09:21.305 --> 01:09:27.245
