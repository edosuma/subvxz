Good morning, Kelly.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.398
Morning, Paulette.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.457
Thank you very much.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.868
- Thanks.
- Bye.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.248
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi, Dominique.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.330
See you in history.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.341
Yeah.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.923
See... see ya.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.720
Why Kelly?
I mean like, really, dom?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.869
Well, he was the only one nice to me
when I first moved here.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.554
That was like 10 years ago.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.647
Okay.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.699
Check it out, boys.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.399
It's the human garbage disposal.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.450
Look at this miserable
piece of shit.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.037
Hey!
Where do you think you're goin'?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.168
Hey.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.875
Answer the question, trash boy.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.415
Yeah, answer the question,
trash boy.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.463
We warned you about
coming here before school.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.591
Hey!

04:20.177 --> 04:21.177
Leave him alone.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.511
You guys are such jerks!

04:23.138 --> 04:25.254
Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is
just guy stuff, Dominique.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.096
Hey.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.350
Don't touch her.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.300
What the fuck did you just say?

04:30.687 --> 04:31.687
What the fuck he say?

04:35.484 --> 04:37.020
You're going dumpster
diving for that.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.859
Think so.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.772
To the dump!

04:45.702 --> 04:47.442
Ladies and gentlemen!

04:47.454 --> 04:50.241
Trash boy has won himself
an all you can eat buffet.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.499
Stop it!

04:51.917 --> 04:53.657
Oh, and a free soda
to wash it all down.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.785
What's going on here?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.291
Get the hell outta here!

04:59.883 --> 05:01.043
I'll call the cops on you!

05:09.476 --> 05:11.432
Hey, hey, it's okay,
they're gone now.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.636
I'm... I'm sorry, Kelly.
I didn't mean to make it worse.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.372
I don't know why
they always pick on you.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.931
We can't be late to school, dom.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.922
- Do you want a ride?
- Uh, my dad would kill me

05:20.946 --> 05:22.482
if he gets slime on the seats.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.898
It's okay,
but thanks for asking.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.331
Hang in there.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.587
Dude, check it out.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.465
Ladies and gentlemen!

07:11.723 --> 07:12.825
Trash boy has won himself...

07:12.849 --> 07:16.387
Check it out, man!

07:19.064 --> 07:20.064
What the fuck?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.126
- I'm so... I'm so sorry.
- Are you blind, bitch?

07:22.150 --> 07:23.435
No, Tucker, I really...

07:24.486 --> 07:25.566
What?

07:26.655 --> 07:27.655
I'm so sorry.

07:33.703 --> 07:34.738
The fuck outta here.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.180
Kelly, help me with
the groceries, honey.

07:52.681 --> 07:53.681
How was school?

07:54.557 --> 07:55.743
Dominique was nice to me.

07:55.767 --> 07:56.882
Oh, I miss her.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.599
That was middle school, mom.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.272
You should ask her out!

08:05.485 --> 08:06.645
And I need that receipt.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.882
All right,
I need you to take those,

08:17.914 --> 08:19.905
I need you to start to
rip it apart for me, okay?

08:20.166 --> 08:21.206
Then put them in the bowl.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.537
All right?
Now mommy will cut all these up.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.410
Hey! How was school? =fine.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.713
I would love to have some
help with dinner tonight.

08:28.967 --> 08:29.967
You know that I can't.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.340
Oh, I know.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.836
You're busy with
track and homework

08:35.097 --> 08:37.054
and the study group or theater.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.508
And I'm proud of you.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.471
Anyone special?

08:45.066 --> 08:46.397
No, it's Nelson.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.651
Again.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.715
I thought you were just crazy
about him a couple of weeks ago.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.550
Yeah, well, he bullied
one of my friends today.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.656
I could never like
a guy like that.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.907
Well, honey, maybe
he was just showing off.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.529
Do you think Nelson felt
your friend was his competition?

09:00.790 --> 09:02.576
I doubt it.
Do you remember Kelly?

09:03.793 --> 09:04.793
Kelly?

09:06.337 --> 09:08.657
The weird kid that used to eat
paper and pencils and stuff?

09:08.798 --> 09:10.538
Really, mom? You too?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.090
What? What did I say?

09:14.804 --> 09:16.214
You know what? Forget it.

10:27.710 --> 10:28.710
Kelly?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.749
How's, uh,
how's your appetite, buddy?

10:33.716 --> 10:35.422
For garbage, doctor,
it's excellent.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.562
I thought you said
he was gonna outgrow this.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.590
Pica is not uncommon
in children.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.012
But most kids do outgrow it.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.171
Maybe it's just
the flu this time.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.847
It's going around, you know.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.290
You're not sick
because of the flu, Kelly.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.034
You're sick because of
your eating disorder.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.733
You're malnourished.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.494
Have you at least been
taking your iron pills?

10:54.863 --> 10:55.863
Yeah.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.072
I take those every day.

11:02.912 --> 11:03.912
Bernice.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.614
I don't see this
as a dietary issue,

11:07.876 --> 11:09.082
I think it's psychological.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.509
I think it's time that
Kelly talked to someone.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.584
Do we really need
another doctor?

11:17.343 --> 11:19.675
Kelly has an obsession
he cannot control.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.716
He needs help to work through
his compulsive behavior.

11:23.892 --> 11:24.892
Mom.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.604
I'll be okay.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.494
Thank you so much for
making the house call,

11:33.526 --> 11:35.437
- I really appreciate it.
- Anytime, bernice.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.321
Let's have dinner.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.658
I think a man's influence
would be good for Kelly.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.290
I'll let you know.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.546
He's got a crush on you.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.715
Nol

11:58.968 --> 12:00.754
I got a crush on you!

12:05.058 --> 12:06.058
I love you.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.352
I love you.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.942
Reverend pflueger is my name,

12:20.949 --> 12:23.486
and healing is my game.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.527
I know I look like two
box cars bumped together

12:27.789 --> 12:29.620
and I rolled out
of a hobo's ass,

12:29.874 --> 12:31.535
but I had a rough night.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.001
I'm a man.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.164
I'm just a man.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.332
But the good lord above
gave me a gift.

12:40.969 --> 12:45.633
It's my life mission to share
that gift to his flock.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.714
With these hands,

12:49.060 --> 12:51.176
I could take away
anything that ails you,

12:52.146 --> 12:53.636
whatever ails you.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.481
With my touch,
you will be free from pain.

12:58.069 --> 13:01.561
Is there anyone here
that could use my gift?

13:02.156 --> 13:03.156
Anyone?

13:05.201 --> 13:06.407
You.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.156
What part of your body
has failed you, dear lady?

13:13.209 --> 13:15.916
My back and my legs.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.120
They're in excruciating pain.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.916
Now, we're gonna fix that.

13:20.842 --> 13:23.333
Yeah, please donate
to the healing jar...

13:23.970 --> 13:26.211
- Oh.
- To empower my hands.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.840
Together, we share
everything in this life.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.428
He will give energy
to my healing hands

13:34.772 --> 13:36.854
that god has bestowed upon me.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.932
And I will heal you.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.977
What part of your
leg really hurts you?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.853
It's my left knee.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.234
Oh, lord, lord.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.871
In this moment,
just give me the healing power

13:53.041 --> 13:54.827
to heal this woman's leg.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.874
To take the pain away.

13:57.253 --> 14:01.212
Heal this woman that she
might throw this Walker away

14:01.466 --> 14:02.626
to the side of the road.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.796
Wait, did you hear that crack?

14:06.012 --> 14:07.012
Did you hear it?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.546
Now tell me how you feel?

14:11.851 --> 14:12.851
I think...

14:14.520 --> 14:16.226
It's a miracle! =yesl

14:16.522 --> 14:19.138
it's a miracle!
=-just throw that Walker to the side.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.311
Throw it to
the side of the road.

14:21.569 --> 14:25.528
- Praise the lord!
- I have no more pain.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.610
- Praise Jesus!
- Hallelujah!

14:27.867 --> 14:29.386
- Hallelujah!
- Thank you.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.616
Hallelujah! Uh-huh.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.281
Come closer,
this is not a trick!

14:33.956 --> 14:36.663
This is not done by me,
this is done by the lord above!

14:37.001 --> 14:38.457
I have no pain.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.624
Oh, thank Jesus.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.294
Uh, if he'll come.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.879
He's too sick to move.

14:48.679 --> 14:49.679
Oh, could you?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.925
- Let's do it.
- Okay, sounds good.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.472
I'm just gonna go grab my car

14:53.726 --> 14:54.806
and then you can follow me?

14:55.144 --> 14:57.180
Yeah, sure.

14:57.897 --> 14:58.897
Thank you.

15:09.534 --> 15:10.534
Very impressive.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.031
How is it that you can heal?

15:14.789 --> 15:15.789
God.

15:16.791 --> 15:17.791
I can help you.

15:19.585 --> 15:20.585
Excuse me”?

15:21.170 --> 15:22.330
I can help you.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.959
Oh. Who the fuck are you?

15:26.384 --> 15:27.384
Red elk.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.918
- Red ass?
- Red elk.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.135
Red elk. And I can help you

15:32.390 --> 15:33.550
let go of the medicine.

15:34.559 --> 15:35.559
The medicine?

15:36.227 --> 15:37.227
My power to heal?

15:40.022 --> 15:42.263
Why would I ever do that, chief?

15:45.486 --> 15:46.896
You cannot be harmed.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.778
Whoever tries will
feel the pain.

15:50.324 --> 15:54.112
It protects itself,
so it protects its host.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.327
That is the medicine's gift.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.822
I'm reverend pflueger,
the healer.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.117
Healing is a special gift
to repair a weakness.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.537
The medicine is purity,
but if you abuse it,

16:06.048 --> 16:07.788
you will eventually
destroy yourself.

16:08.885 --> 16:12.924
Who gives a fuck what
I do with my power?

16:13.431 --> 16:15.137
It doesn't belong to you!

16:16.142 --> 16:18.053
That grave is over
100 years old.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.972
I protect it,
my father protected it,

16:21.355 --> 16:23.095
my grandfather protected it.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.390
You must give the medicine back.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.652
Give it back?

16:28.779 --> 16:29.985
I used to be a nobody,

16:31.282 --> 16:33.193
and now
I'm Jesus fuckin' Christ,

16:33.451 --> 16:35.487
and I'm gonna live forever,
red man.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.287
Red elk.

16:37.997 --> 16:38.997
Whatever.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.993
And you will not live forever.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.292
Please.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.542
Trust me.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.040
Trust me, my brother.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.289
I am not your fuckin' brother.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.342
And I will never give
the power back to you.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.882
Ever.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.307
We're done here.

16:58.059 --> 16:59.344
I have to go give my medicine

16:59.602 --> 17:01.593
to this really
pretty young woman.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.560
Adios, chief red fucker.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.069
Just...

17:10.488 --> 17:12.444
You know what I mean? Fuck you.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.202
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.538
Yeah, so, just come in.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.202
He's getting worse and worse.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.242
I really hate to
see a child suffer.

17:26.503 --> 17:27.618
But as I mentioned before,

17:27.880 --> 17:29.608
I think we should take
care of the money first.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.168
Because a lot of people,
you know,

17:31.175 --> 17:33.211
they... they have
a change of heart

17:33.219 --> 17:36.427
after I've done my work,
and you know what I mean.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.842
Yeah, no, of course.
I have it, I have it right here.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.518
Where the fuck is my money?

17:46.649 --> 17:47.649
Oh, what happened?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.245
Oh, that's okay,
I'll come back another time.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.060
No, no, please,
no, I need you now.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.275
Wait. There it is, sorry.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.533
Ah.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.005
- Thank you.
- Here you hold that.

18:01.330 --> 18:05.289
Why don't we take a look at
this boy of yours, shall we?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.085
Okay.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.259
Kelly?

18:14.510 --> 18:15.790
There's someone here to see you.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.093
This is reverend pflueger.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.100
May I ask you something?
=-mm-hm.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.475
Will your husband be joining us?

18:30.276 --> 18:33.188
No, um, Kelly's father died
before he was born, so...

18:33.446 --> 18:34.446
Oh.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.323
Sorry to hear that.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.325
Thank you.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.246
You know what we're gonna do?

18:51.005 --> 18:52.165
We're gonna make you better,

18:53.090 --> 18:54.250
we're gonna take care of you.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.142
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.555
Before we get started,

19:09.106 --> 19:10.146
can I use your facilities?

19:10.524 --> 19:13.311
P... please, please?
=-of course.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.881
- Thank you.
- Just down the hallway to the left.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.237
Thank you, thank you...
Thank you.

19:48.646 --> 19:49.646
You feeling better?

19:50.439 --> 19:51.439
Yeah, yeah.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.068
Fit as a fiddle.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.145
Yes, one... one of the good
things about being a healer,

20:00.241 --> 20:01.241
you don't have any...

20:01.409 --> 20:03.570
You don't have any,
uh, illnesses...

20:04.078 --> 20:05.078
No injuries.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.168
What's his name?

20:16.173 --> 20:17.173
Kelly.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.796
Kelly.
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly... Kelly.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.336
We have a lot in common,
you and me, Kelly.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.641
Pain.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.266
And a hope for light.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.148
Yeah.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.312
I only have half
a lung in my body.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.691
Then why are you smoking?

20:42.992 --> 20:44.528
None of your fuckin' business.

20:47.455 --> 20:52.324
Oh, and once we start this,
there's no stopping it.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.416
This is very powerful medicine.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.294
- We can't be interrupted.
- Okay.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.686
What are you doing?

21:16.400 --> 21:17.435
Holy shit.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.024
I feel everything.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.575
And it fucking hurts!

21:44.428 --> 21:46.293
Oh, god...

21:54.146 --> 21:56.228
Go fuck yourself, kid.

22:00.861 --> 22:01.861
Mom.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.738
I'm hungry.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.661
What the hell happened?

22:17.545 --> 22:19.206
I don't know,
but I got dibs on the boots.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.498
I got a couple of questions.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.761
Bernice.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.552
I know it's been a long night,
we're almost done.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.179
How are you feeling, Kelly?

22:35.896 --> 22:36.896
I feel fine.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.312
Uh, you reported
a cigarette burn?

22:39.692 --> 22:40.692
Yeah, yeah.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.741
It burnt a hole right on
his chest, right here.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.400
Looks like you're okay.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.490
Look, either way,

22:51.620 --> 22:53.485
we're sorry that pflueger
was conning you

22:53.747 --> 22:55.283
into the whole healing thing.

22:55.666 --> 22:56.666
Mm.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.670
Okay.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.004
Look, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to call.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.508
Thank you, sheriff adler.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.131
Appreciate that, thank you.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.225
He's got a crush on you.

23:35.331 --> 23:36.331
That is so cool.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.326
I'm so tired.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.370
I barely slept at
all last night.

23:42.463 --> 23:43.463
I slept great.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.121
Hug me before work.

23:53.724 --> 23:56.306
Something awesome happened to me

23:56.602 --> 23:57.602
after pflueger healed me.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.104
Look.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.018
Why are you flipping me off?

24:02.483 --> 24:05.020
I cutit.
And... and then boom, it healed.

24:05.653 --> 24:06.653
And it didn't even hurt.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.152
What are you talking about?

24:09.531 --> 24:10.531
It healed.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.539
Ju... just like the cigarette
burn on my chest.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.287
Sure.

24:18.749 --> 24:19.749
Well, that's a good sign.

24:20.668 --> 24:21.668
What?

24:21.877 --> 24:23.788
You drank the soda
instead of eating the can.

24:25.798 --> 24:26.798
Invincible.

24:28.592 --> 24:29.592
I'm invincible.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.003
You must be contagious.

24:32.763 --> 24:33.763
Now I feel great.

25:34.950 --> 25:35.950
Hey, Kelly.

25:36.744 --> 25:37.744
Bike problems?

25:38.537 --> 25:39.537
Just an old chain.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.016
Yeah, I think you
outgrew that bike

25:41.040 --> 25:42.155
like 10 years ago.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.437
My god, Kelly. Last time I saw you
you were just skin and bones.

25:46.837 --> 25:48.919
Did you take some
sort of miracle pill

25:49.173 --> 25:50.173
while you were home sick?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.541
You do look different.

25:54.428 --> 25:55.668
Um, dom,

25:55.679 --> 25:56.839
I'll wait for you in the car.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.015
Bye.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.061
So...

26:03.645 --> 26:04.645
Um...

26:06.023 --> 26:07.208
I, um, I heard about that
guy dying at your place,

26:07.232 --> 26:08.232
that must've been scary.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.854
That was super weird.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.571
But he did...

26:16.825 --> 26:18.611
Something good came of it, it...

26:19.787 --> 26:20.827
It's like I'm a new Kelly.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.661
Well, I like this new Kelly.

26:27.836 --> 26:28.836
Bye.

26:29.755 --> 26:30.755
Bye.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.216
You think you have a chance
with her, trash boy?

26:43.727 --> 26:45.388
She deserves anybody
but your brother.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.480
What'd you say, freak?

26:50.275 --> 26:51.275
You can't hurt me.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.768
Oh, I bet I can, trash boy.

26:55.739 --> 26:56.739
F

27:00.953 --> 27:01.953
Nope.

27:02.162 --> 27:03.162
I didn't feel it.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.811
F

27:10.629 --> 27:11.629
Amazing.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.245
Are you done hurting me?

27:13.674 --> 27:15.380
I'm not sure
you can take much more.

27:23.517 --> 27:24.802
Strike three, you're out!

27:25.602 --> 27:26.602
Get away from Mel!

27:26.812 --> 27:27.812
Fucking monster!

27:31.358 --> 27:32.723
Feel free to beat me up anytime!

27:54.214 --> 27:55.214
Mom!

27:55.465 --> 27:56.905
I got a job
at the pizza place today.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.749
That's amazing!

27:58.760 --> 28:00.170
I'm so proud of you.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.240
I was thinking maybe
I could finally get

28:02.264 --> 28:03.754
a... a cell phone or a new bike,

28:03.974 --> 28:05.510
or maybe even a car.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.760
Who knocks like that?

28:11.356 --> 28:12.721
Stay by the truck, please.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.268
=

28:14.610 --> 28:17.647
Sorry to barge in on you
so late, miss Mason.

28:17.905 --> 28:19.645
I'm, uh, Gus whitcomb.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.943
I'm the football
coach at Stinson high.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.823
Oh. Call me bernice, please.

28:24.995 --> 28:26.280
Okay, bernice. Um...

28:27.039 --> 28:28.239
Yeah, so, the reason I'm here,

28:29.583 --> 28:33.041
my... my son, Reed, he was
attacked before school today.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.939
Oh, that's horrible,
I'm so sorry.

28:34.963 --> 28:38.455
Yeah, well, it's a...
It's a strange situation.

28:39.009 --> 28:40.009
Um...

28:40.969 --> 28:43.460
Reed says that Kelly was there.

28:45.474 --> 28:46.474
Kelly?

28:46.892 --> 28:48.612
Hey, honey.
Do you know anything about this?

28:48.727 --> 28:51.890
Reed was trying to beat me up,
and well, he hurt himself instead.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.513
He hurt him... self?

28:54.900 --> 28:56.765
See, that just doesn't
make any sense.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.027
Reed always picks on me.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.353
No, I khow that, but I mean...

28:59.529 --> 29:00.689
What? Wait, wait, wait.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.779
You know your son
bullies my son?

29:03.075 --> 29:04.155
Have you tried to stop him?

29:04.910 --> 29:05.945
Why? Boys will be boys.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.072
What the fuck does that mean?

29:08.538 --> 29:09.578
Bernice, please, I just...

29:10.999 --> 29:13.102
No, that's miss Mason to you
actually, coach whitcomb.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.162
Okay, back to that. Miss Mason.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.704
Um... I just want to know
what your son knows, that's it.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.584
Kelly, how did Reed get hurt?

29:22.970 --> 29:24.989
I didn't beat him up if
that's what he's telling you.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.379
No, I khow... that.

29:27.641 --> 29:28.847
I know there's no chance

29:29.726 --> 29:31.717
of you beating up my boy,
god no. I just...

29:32.688 --> 29:34.128
He didn't do that
to himself, did he?

29:34.189 --> 29:35.804
Look, you may not
believe your son,

29:36.525 --> 29:37.525
but I believe mine.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.348
Well, something's going on here!

29:39.444 --> 29:41.164
Right. Kelly's told you
everything he knows.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.653
- Goodnight.
- Wha...

29:45.117 --> 29:46.732
You didn't hurt that boy, right?

29:47.244 --> 29:49.564
That's the other pflueger thing
I was gonna tell you about.

29:50.414 --> 29:51.870
But it's easier to show you.

29:51.873 --> 29:52.873
So slap me.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.812
But not too hard, 'cause
I don't want you to get hurt.

29:55.836 --> 29:56.836
Slap you?

29:57.045 --> 29:59.286
Just... just do it.
Only a little slap.

29:59.506 --> 30:00.775
Okay, I've never
hit you in my life,

30:00.799 --> 30:02.664
- I'm not gonna start now.
- Oh, Jesus, mom.

30:02.968 --> 30:03.968
Then... uh...

30:05.053 --> 30:06.053
Pinch me.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.384
Ow!

30:11.101 --> 30:12.101
Invincible.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.227
Amazing, isn't it?

30:16.064 --> 30:17.304
Nobody will ever hurt us again.

30:18.442 --> 30:19.442
I won't let them.

30:22.988 --> 30:23.988
Ow!

30:27.034 --> 30:28.899
Honey, these are all great ideas

30:29.119 --> 30:30.199
to dream about, but...

30:31.038 --> 30:32.619
We might be getting
carried away.

30:33.415 --> 30:35.656
A punch or a few
pinches is one thing,

30:35.917 --> 30:37.782
but that doesn't mean
you can stop a bullet

30:38.045 --> 30:40.001
or withstand fire.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.843
No, don't!

30:52.476 --> 30:53.476
Oh, my god.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.738
Well, I could withstand
the cigarette lighter.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.145
We've gotta keep this
between us.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.913
You can't draw any more
attention to yourself,

31:06.948 --> 31:07.948
promise me.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.490
I promise.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.038
Wow.

31:15.457 --> 31:18.073
You don't have any other
superpowers, do you?

31:20.629 --> 31:22.711
- Hey, do you have my hair tie?
- Oh, yeah.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.482
Thanks for letting me borrow it.
=yeah.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.461
- See you in class.
- Okay.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.084
Yo! Fuck! Who did that?

31:41.233 --> 31:42.689
I will fuck you up!

31:42.943 --> 31:45.434
Did you do that? Hey!

31:53.703 --> 31:54.703
Dominance.

31:55.705 --> 31:56.705
Okay.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.455
So, we've read about it.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.167
Hopefully.

32:02.129 --> 32:03.494
There's lots of
stories about it.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.000
So, it was mostly passed down

32:07.008 --> 32:09.670
through fire dances and chants.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.157
But I couldn't
find any evidence,

32:13.181 --> 32:16.344
any real evidence of
native American tribes

32:16.601 --> 32:17.966
eating the heart
of their enemies.

32:18.937 --> 32:19.937
Maybe it didn't happen.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.180
But maybe, just maybe it did.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.193
Hey, hey, dom.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.152
You dropped your hair tie.

32:28.864 --> 32:29.864
I ate the tag.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.363
Do you want the rest of it?

32:34.077 --> 32:35.277
I'm really trying to cut down.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.411
In fact,
just recently a Syrian rebel

32:39.166 --> 32:40.906
ate the heart of his enemy.

32:53.597 --> 32:54.997
I think a swim is
about the only way

32:55.223 --> 32:56.759
to cool off the body today.

33:01.271 --> 33:03.603
We've been down to
the river so many times.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.935
Maybe there's a more
private way to cool down.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.610
- Private?
- Oh, that feels good.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.375
What is she doing here?

33:31.801 --> 33:33.086
You are such a bad boy.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.012
Can I join?

33:35.514 --> 33:36.549
I don't mind at all.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.182
Kelly?

34:03.291 --> 34:04.651
You are such a bad boy.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.128
Yes!

34:14.261 --> 34:15.261
Hey!

34:15.804 --> 34:17.043
What is going on here?

34:17.472 --> 34:19.382
This is important stuff!

34:21.935 --> 34:23.014
Get back to work.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.931
Go prospectors!

34:44.373 --> 34:46.614
- Milady.
- You're hilarious.

34:46.876 --> 34:48.596
Me and the lads are
headed to the river bend

34:48.670 --> 34:50.877
to partake in some imbibing.

34:51.464 --> 34:54.080
Should you feel so inclined,
please join us.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.273
Okay, I have no idea
what the hell he said,

34:56.511 --> 34:57.842
but I'll be there.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.096
Yes!

35:00.223 --> 35:01.223
Whoa!

35:01.433 --> 35:04.095
Stop it! Stop! Put me down!

35:04.352 --> 35:05.683
Oh, dom, why you so uptight?

35:05.937 --> 35:07.177
Whoa, dom, why you so uptight?

35:07.397 --> 35:09.637
- You know what? Stop it.
- Hey! Leave her alone.

35:09.691 --> 35:12.307
Whoa!

35:12.569 --> 35:13.684
Back up, everyone.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.685
It's trash boy here
to save the day.

35:17.365 --> 35:18.730
Kelly, it's okay, I handled it.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.169
No, you can't just grab
her anytime you want.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.643
What are you gonna
do about it, pussy?

35:25.582 --> 35:28.164
Yeah, you, uh, you scared,
trash boy?

35:32.172 --> 35:33.628
It's payback time,
you little shit.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.210
Hey, hey, hey!

35:36.718 --> 35:38.549
Break it up, cut the crap.
Will ya?

35:38.803 --> 35:40.384
Yeah, this is
supposed to be fun.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.754
Yes, milady.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.741
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
nobody makes fun of me.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.329
Okay? Do that again and
I'll fucking kill you,

35:46.353 --> 35:48.193
- I swear to god...
- Hey. What did I just say?

35:48.813 --> 35:50.929
- Save it for the game.
- Ye... yes, coach.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.479
Hey. There's always later.

35:56.196 --> 35:57.196
Really, still?

35:57.364 --> 36:00.356
Stop talking. Go! Unbelievable.

36:00.617 --> 36:01.982
Come on, tuck. Ride with us.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.122
You know, Kelly...

36:08.667 --> 36:09.907
Things were hard enough for you

36:10.043 --> 36:11.283
when you were avoiding trouble.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.564
Now it's like
you're looking for it.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.919
No, you're just mad about Reed.

36:15.256 --> 36:16.496
Mad? No.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.545
More like bewildered.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.427
But, uh, I'll figure out
what's going on with you.

36:23.973 --> 36:26.680
And when I do, your ass is mine.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.095
That's not fair, coach.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.270
Life's not fair.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.189
Get used to it.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.360
Dominique.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.935
There's a party
at the river bend!

36:40.156 --> 36:41.196
Come on, come on, come on!

36:47.372 --> 36:48.828
- Dominique!
- I heard you!

36:54.421 --> 36:57.333

sleep all day »

37:01.720 --> 37:04.211

37:04.431 --> 37:07.389
Uh, does my middle finger
smell like Sarah's skunk?

37:09.436 --> 37:10.436
Yeah, bro!

37:15.108 --> 37:17.019
Woo! Sick, man, okay!

- Dude, it's trash boy.
- Oh, you want to scare him?

37:37.922 --> 37:39.378
Make him piss his pants.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.839
Nah. Make him shit his pants!

37:42.093 --> 37:43.378
Let's do it!

37:43.386 --> 37:45.306
Dude, this night keeps
getting better and better.

37:58.526 --> 37:59.526
Fuck him up.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.536
Get right up on his ass.

Oh, man.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.792
- You all right, man?
- Yeah, I'm good.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.352
Oh, shit.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.395
Brad. What?

39:23.653 --> 39:24.358
Brad. =oh...

39:24.612 --> 39:25.772
Hey, buddy.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.190
Shit!

39:29.993 --> 39:31.403
What the fuck?

39:31.703 --> 39:33.318
=dude. -

39:33.580 --> 39:35.320
Brad. Shit, bro.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.767
Hey, we're gonna get
you some help, man.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.166
Get the fuck out of the car!

39:40.420 --> 39:42.331
Get me outta here.
Come on, get out!

39:46.593 --> 39:48.553
Did you see his face?
He's not breathing.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.548
Call 911. Call 911.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.366
My phone's in the car,
it's under Brad's seat.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.390
Tucker. Tucker!

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
Bro!

39:55.602 --> 39:56.602
Fuck!

39:59.230 --> 40:00.230
Oh, shit, bro, Kelly.

40:02.483 --> 40:03.518
I thought Brad ran him over.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.732
My fuckin' brother was right.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.523
Why couldn't you all
just leave me alone?

40:08.281 --> 40:09.441
Look what you've done!

40:46.444 --> 40:47.604
That's Brad's car!

40:53.910 --> 40:54.945
Oh, my god!

40:55.203 --> 40:56.203
Where's Tony?

40:58.790 --> 41:00.997
They took off down the road,
after they hit me.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.250
Are you hurt?

41:04.003 --> 41:05.043
What happened?

41:05.338 --> 41:06.578
I was riding my bike home

41:06.589 --> 41:08.029
and they came after
me in Brad's car.

41:08.841 --> 41:10.456
They ran you over with the car?

41:17.350 --> 41:19.328
That's why I brought 'em out as
soon as they came to the house,

41:19.352 --> 41:20.712
because they... they were
in shock,

41:20.895 --> 41:23.011
talking all this nonsense.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.606
- Where's Kelly?
- Bernice, Kelly seems to be okay.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.646
- He's over here.
- Oh, my god.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.439
Oh, my god, are you okay?

41:31.781 --> 41:34.022
No one talks any of
that horseshit nonsense.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.819
- You got it?
- Okay.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.277
I haven't talked to Kelly yet,

41:37.495 --> 41:39.611
so please don't go anywhere
until I release him.

41:39.622 --> 41:40.622
Okay.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.038
Kelly, what happened?

41:42.250 --> 41:43.936
Brad and those guys
ran me over with their car.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.920
All the wounds transferred
to Brad and killed him.

41:46.254 --> 41:47.774
We're supposed to
keep that between us.

41:48.589 --> 41:50.250
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

41:53.302 --> 41:54.302
Tell him what happened.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.336
Kelly wa... uh,
Kelly was riding his bike

41:57.598 --> 41:58.678
in the middle of the road,

41:58.683 --> 42:00.674
and then Brad swerved
to avoid hitting him

42:00.935 --> 42:02.516
and, uh, lost control
and wrecked.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.071
The airbag blew up
in his face and killed him.

42:05.398 --> 42:08.515
So Kelly purposefully pulled
himself in front of the car?

42:08.776 --> 42:10.437
Almost like he was daring us to.

42:11.279 --> 42:12.610
Tucker, what'd you see?

42:12.822 --> 42:15.029
Dumbass was riding his bike
in the middle of the road.

42:19.829 --> 42:21.694
There's no way
you can tell the truth.

42:22.206 --> 42:23.206
Your mom's right.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.699
Okay, so...

42:28.755 --> 42:30.495
I got thrown off my bike
and in the bushes.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.829
It's a miracle
I didn't get hurt.

42:35.845 --> 42:37.210
I got dibs on the car.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.759
And then you'll
destroy yourself.

43:27.230 --> 43:28.936
The whole town knows
about your accident.

43:29.941 --> 43:31.168
Let's hope that
the cops stick with

43:31.192 --> 43:32.557
the airbag malfunction theory.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.687
Yo. Bros, we gotta do
something about that.

43:38.157 --> 43:39.613
Not me, I have no
death wish, bro.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.364
Hey. You're either with us
or against us.

43:43.830 --> 43:44.950
So make up your mind, dildo.

43:45.081 --> 43:46.617
Grow some balls, man.

43:46.874 --> 43:47.874
Yeah, like Brad?

43:49.085 --> 43:50.575
- Geez.
- Come on, man.

43:52.004 --> 43:53.004
Is that your lunch?

43:53.881 --> 43:55.621
Yeah. I love rice cakes.

43:55.883 --> 43:57.589
Those things taste
like styrofoam.

43:59.637 --> 44:00.637
You want one?

44:02.431 --> 44:04.888
Well, they are on
my diet plan, so...

44:08.729 --> 44:10.014
Oh, pass the peanut butter.

44:22.869 --> 44:23.869
I have a plan.

44:25.580 --> 44:28.060
Tonight, trash family begins
their journey out of trailer town.

44:32.879 --> 44:34.119
I don't like all the attention.

44:34.797 --> 44:36.357
I just want things
to go back to normal.

44:36.966 --> 44:38.297
Normal? You?

44:44.056 --> 44:45.637
They're gonna forget
about this soon.

44:46.934 --> 44:47.969
Just stick with me, okay?

44:51.397 --> 44:53.250
Dude, there's so many
other girls at this school.

44:53.274 --> 44:54.684
Just let Kelly have Dominique.

44:55.484 --> 44:57.315
Bro, this isn't about Dominique,

44:57.570 --> 44:59.652
it's a tribute to Brad, asshole.

45:01.908 --> 45:03.588
Hey, um, you know the new
Halloween is out.

45:03.910 --> 45:06.117
Oh, yeah! I was really wanting
to see that one.

45:07.496 --> 45:08.496
Yeah.

45:11.792 --> 45:14.329
Um, are you... are you doing
anything this week?

45:16.172 --> 45:17.172
I don't think so.

45:17.590 --> 45:18.830
No, I think I'm...

45:18.841 --> 45:20.001
Yeah, you know, school stuff.

45:25.348 --> 45:27.430
Okay.
Well, I better get to class.

45:27.642 --> 45:28.927
- So...
- Okay.

45:29.185 --> 45:30.891
Talk later? =yeah.

45:30.895 --> 45:31.895
I'll talk to you later.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.522
Really, that's... that's it?

45:39.528 --> 45:40.938
Oh. Um...

45:42.114 --> 45:43.354
Want to go to the movies Friday

45:43.407 --> 45:45.272
and check out that
new Halloween movie?

45:45.534 --> 45:47.866
- Yes, okay.
- Okay.

45:47.870 --> 45:49.576
- Okay, all right.
- All right.

45:49.997 --> 45:51.658
- I'll see you Friday.
- Friday.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.156
- Okay, bye.
- All right, bye.

46:12.687 --> 46:14.393
Yo. Shifts up.

46:14.647 --> 46:15.647
I got this.

46:16.607 --> 46:17.607
See ya, bro.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.391
Ow! God! That's really hot.

46:20.861 --> 46:22.192
So sorry. =just...

46:23.072 --> 46:24.072
Go, go.

46:28.160 --> 46:29.570
Don't forget the trash.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.085
Are you Kelly Mason?

46:50.474 --> 46:53.216
- Yeah.
- Are you the kid who got hit by the car?

46:54.437 --> 46:55.437
Yeah.

46:55.896 --> 46:56.896
Strange.

46:57.690 --> 46:59.351
You don't look like
you got hurt at all.

47:01.819 --> 47:02.819
I was very lucky.

47:03.612 --> 47:04.612
A bush broke my fall.

47:05.656 --> 47:06.771
You knew pflueger.

47:09.201 --> 47:10.532
The reverend came to my trailer

47:11.037 --> 47:13.397
and helped me when I was sick,
and then he died, that's all.

47:27.303 --> 47:28.303
Hey, mom.

47:30.014 --> 47:32.005
I asked Dominique to go out
with me and guess what she said?

47:32.016 --> 47:34.257
- What?
- She said yes, just like that.

47:34.518 --> 47:35.518
And boom!

47:37.021 --> 47:38.101
We're gonna go see a movie.

47:38.105 --> 47:39.105
Oh, honey!

47:39.398 --> 47:40.683
I'm so proud of you.

47:40.941 --> 47:42.772
You just needed some
confidence, that's all.

47:43.319 --> 47:45.731
You know, pflueger was
a godsend, wasn't he?

47:46.113 --> 47:47.113
Yeah.

47:47.323 --> 47:48.800
I wanna give you a big
bear hug right now,

47:48.824 --> 47:49.824
but I don't feel so good.

47:53.913 --> 47:55.033
Hey, can I get you anything?

47:56.999 --> 47:58.435
You know what?
We ran out of aspirin and

47:58.459 --> 47:59.659
I've got a splitting headache.

47:59.794 --> 48:01.659
- I'll go get you some.
- Would you?

48:01.921 --> 48:02.956
Yeah, can ti take the car?

48:02.963 --> 48:03.963
Yeah, sure.

48:10.179 --> 48:11.179
Why are we waiting?

48:11.931 --> 48:13.211
Let's just do this
thing already.

48:13.682 --> 48:15.162
- What if we get caught?
- Hey, chill.

48:16.018 --> 48:18.259
All right?
She'll be leaving for work soon.

48:18.687 --> 48:19.998
And... and we're sure
Kelly's not home?

48:20.022 --> 48:21.262
Would you put your vagina away?

48:21.941 --> 48:24.432
He's working, dildo.
Don't you ever listen?

48:26.946 --> 48:27.946
Hey.

48:33.661 --> 48:36.277
- Mama trash is on the move.
- 0000, showtime!

48:36.539 --> 48:38.450
- Let's do it!
- Get in the car, dude.

48:50.553 --> 48:52.089
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

48:53.097 --> 48:54.497
Hey, hey, quiet, quiet.

48:55.766 --> 48:57.472
Shut up! They've got neighbors.

48:58.727 --> 49:00.687
Go hook this up!
Come on, come on, come on.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.136
I can't, I can't. What the fuck?

49:02.398 --> 49:03.888
What the fuck are
you doing, man?

49:04.233 --> 49:07.020
- Get the fuck off me.
- Are you trying to screw us over? Huh?

49:07.194 --> 49:08.730
I will beat your fuckin' ass.

49:09.196 --> 49:11.236
I don't want to be like you,
so get the hell off me.

49:11.532 --> 49:12.532
Be a bitch then!

49:39.351 --> 49:41.262
- We're good, let's go.
- Come on, let's go!

50:07.171 --> 50:08.377
Get the chains, boys.

50:10.049 --> 50:11.049
This shit's stuck.

50:11.258 --> 50:12.652
Let's go... well, fuck,
move your ass!

50:12.676 --> 50:14.792
Just throw it in.
Let's go, come on!

50:16.263 --> 50:17.263
Fuck you, Kelly!

50:18.182 --> 50:19.182
Farewell, Brad.

50:20.142 --> 50:21.632
We got him, boys.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.269
Mission accomplished.

50:57.388 --> 50:58.388
Mom!

50:58.889 --> 51:00.174
Mom!

51:01.517 --> 51:02.517
Mom!

51:06.272 --> 51:07.387
Mom, you're gonna be okay.

51:07.856 --> 51:09.221
You're gonna be okay, I got you.

51:23.706 --> 51:27.415
Nol

51:43.976 --> 51:45.841
Dr. Howard, icu.

51:47.021 --> 51:48.682
Dr. Howard, icu.

51:59.950 --> 52:01.781
It doesn't make any sense.
Thanks.

52:02.870 --> 52:03.905
How is he, doc?

52:04.163 --> 52:05.348
We were wrong about
how much damage

52:05.372 --> 52:06.372
the fire did to him.

52:07.333 --> 52:09.289
Most of the charred skin
we found on his body

52:09.293 --> 52:10.293
was actually...

52:11.879 --> 52:12.879
Bernice's.

52:16.925 --> 52:18.506
Uh, Kelly's ready for release.

52:21.305 --> 52:23.296
Kelly doesn't have
any next of kin.

52:24.516 --> 52:26.097
Can you keep him here
for another night?

52:26.310 --> 52:27.846
I'll make arrangements.

52:28.771 --> 52:29.977
Sure, um...

52:30.731 --> 52:32.892
His mom was a wonderful woman.

52:33.233 --> 52:35.519
Yeah,
she was a beautiful spirit.

52:36.820 --> 52:38.856
Thank you for donating
to her funeral.

52:39.114 --> 52:41.275
Oh, least I could do.

52:41.283 --> 52:43.363
Dr. Howard,
please pick up line nine.

52:44.536 --> 52:46.743
Hey, Kelly. One more night.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.362
I'll come and
pick you up tomorrow,

52:48.791 --> 52:50.497
and we'll go pay
respects to your mom.

52:54.380 --> 52:55.995
I'll leave these here.

53:04.848 --> 53:06.463
Ya'at'eeh, sheriff adler.

53:07.559 --> 53:09.174
Do you remember me?
Ti am red elk.

53:10.187 --> 53:11.187
Yeah!

53:12.606 --> 53:14.686
Man, it's been years since
I've been back to the res.

53:15.401 --> 53:17.266
Kelly has something
that is ours,

53:17.736 --> 53:19.647
given to him by that
scoundrel pflueger.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.565
I have come to get it back.

53:22.366 --> 53:23.526
Wait, wha... what?

53:23.784 --> 53:24.784
What is that?

53:25.369 --> 53:26.369
You are navajo.

53:26.995 --> 53:27.995
You're dine.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.658
I believe you sense
the medicine in him.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.324
Look. This kid has been
through a lot now.

53:34.044 --> 53:35.329
I don't think he needs to hear

53:35.587 --> 53:37.327
about our folklore passed down

53:37.589 --> 53:40.171
from our
great-great-grandfathers, okay?

53:40.551 --> 53:43.088
When you believe, you find me.

53:43.387 --> 53:44.387
You know where I am.

53:45.472 --> 53:47.804
I need your help to
set things right.

53:49.601 --> 53:50.601
Aho.

53:53.605 --> 53:55.391
Dr. horowitz, icu.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.599
Bernice"s greatest
pride was her son Kelly,

53:59.153 --> 54:01.485
and we commend her loving
spirit to eternal life.

54:02.322 --> 54:04.813
And now, may you all
go in god's love.

54:05.451 --> 54:07.191
- Amen.
- Amen.

54:46.158 --> 54:47.614
I'm really sorry about your mom.

54:48.410 --> 54:50.150
She was a very
special person to me.

54:50.871 --> 54:52.361
A second mom when I moved here.

54:55.334 --> 54:57.416
Nobody's gonna think
you're weak if you cry.

55:01.507 --> 55:02.507
I have to be strong.

55:04.885 --> 55:06.445
It's why my mom was
finally proud of me.

55:08.096 --> 55:09.696
She was always proud of you.

55:14.478 --> 55:15.478
Please don't move.

55:16.480 --> 55:17.595
I don't have a choice.

55:19.107 --> 55:20.643
It's not fair making
you leave the town

55:20.901 --> 55:21.901
that you grew up in.

55:22.903 --> 55:24.343
The only thing
I'm gonna miss is you.

55:33.455 --> 55:34.535
Sorry.

55:34.540 --> 55:35.540
Are you kidding?

55:53.725 --> 55:54.725
Bye.

55:59.815 --> 56:00.815
Goodbye.

56:17.749 --> 56:19.614
Dom? Where are you?

56:26.466 --> 56:27.466
Oh, my...

57:16.016 --> 57:18.297
Look, Kelly, I know you don't
want to hear this right now,

57:18.393 --> 57:20.509
but I promise you,
I'm gonna find you

57:20.771 --> 57:22.386
the best foster family

57:23.106 --> 57:25.438
so you don't have to be in
social services that long.

57:30.489 --> 57:32.209
Your mom would be so
proud of you right now,

57:32.324 --> 57:35.612
everybody's talking
about you being a hero

57:35.619 --> 57:36.619
for what you did.

57:39.665 --> 57:40.780
Heroes usually save people.

57:44.461 --> 57:48.295
Heroes have the courage
to do what others can't.

57:51.468 --> 57:52.468
Proud of you.

57:54.596 --> 57:55.756
If there's anything you need,

57:55.847 --> 57:57.007
I'll be there, all right?

57:58.558 --> 57:59.558
I'll wait for you.

58:29.715 --> 58:31.797
Kelly, did you
have any work done

58:32.009 --> 58:33.545
on your trailer recently?

58:34.136 --> 58:35.376
Like did you move it or

58:35.721 --> 58:38.258
anything that would affect
the supports?

58:39.725 --> 58:41.636
- No.
- Landscaping?

58:42.144 --> 58:44.681
Any trucks nearby
that would affect it?

58:45.105 --> 58:46.311
No, not that I know of.

58:47.149 --> 58:48.149
Why?

58:48.358 --> 58:49.939
Before the gas ignited,

58:50.694 --> 58:52.810
your trailer fell
off its supports.

58:53.739 --> 58:56.697
Almost like the supports were
pulled out from underneath.

58:57.117 --> 58:59.449
You know how something
like that could happen?

59:00.412 --> 59:01.492
So this wasn't an accident?

59:06.710 --> 59:08.630
Guys, maybe we tell the cops
that it was a prank.

59:09.087 --> 59:10.887
That... that we thought
the trailer was empty.

59:11.423 --> 59:12.708
Dude, really?

59:13.008 --> 59:14.528
So we could spend
the rest of our lives

59:14.676 --> 59:15.756
getting ass-fucked in jail?

59:15.969 --> 59:17.960
Dude, uh, have you had
too many concussions?

59:18.305 --> 59:20.261
Guys, I told you
not to mess with him.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.972
- He's a freak.
- Shut the fuck up.

59:23.226 --> 59:24.706
Why do I have to sit
next to this guy?

59:24.811 --> 59:26.392
We're not going to the cops

59:26.646 --> 59:27.977
because we had nothing to do

59:28.440 --> 59:29.720
with mama trash getting toasted.

59:29.775 --> 59:31.640
Stop calling her that.

59:31.860 --> 59:33.316
Mama trash, mama trash.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.731
Guys, guys, guys, chill.
Okay? It doesn't even matter.

59:35.739 --> 59:37.659
Trash boy's on his way
out of town already, okay?

59:37.866 --> 59:40.699
- So, case closed.
- Learn from your big bro.

59:40.702 --> 59:42.142
All right,
I know how to handle shit.

59:42.788 --> 59:44.699
- Yeah.
- If you're sure.

59:44.956 --> 59:46.142
And I mean like, positively...

59:46.166 --> 59:47.747
Fuck yes, we're sure!

59:47.959 --> 59:50.575
All right? Now let's go give
trash boy a proper goodbye.

59:50.837 --> 59:52.327
Oh, pucker up bitches,
here we go.

59:58.428 --> 59:59.428
So, someone did this?

59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.032
No, I'm not saying that.

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:02.241
Look, it's...

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.347
Hey, bitch!

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:15.934
Yo. Hey, let's hit the river.

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:17.735
River boys, come on!

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:20.105
River, river, river!

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:21.815
Those motherfuckers!

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:23.317
Calm down, Kelly.

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:26.778
Bad temper will only
get you into trouble.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:27.790
Believe me.

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.789
Don't pay attention to
those idiots, all right?

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.329
Kelly!

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:39.170
Oh, my gosh.

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:46.433
Kelly!

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.351
Dispatch. I need an atv...

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:18.163
- Woo, nice!
- Hard to get off.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:19.903
- It's hot.
- Nobody wants to see that.

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:22.167
You probably do.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:23.794
You're just jealous because
your body looks like a 12 year old.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:25.420
That's funny.

01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:29.829
- How you feelin'?
- I'm all right, I'm all right.

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:31.038
Watch out, there's
some hornets and stuff.

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:32.802
Hornets?

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.304
What are you, a bunch of girls?

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:39.528
Lizard city.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.780
All right.

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:46.116
- Think I'm gonna hop in.
- Oh, a little bath time?

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.734
Yeah, bath time, huh.

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:50.407
Yeah, get in there.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960
- I'm gonna fuck him up.
- You want to fuck him up?

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:57.922
Woo.

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:01.725
- Boom!
- Five bucks you can't hit him.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.362
- Chill out, you bitches.
- Five bucks.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.047
All right, who's gonna pay?

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:08.595
You play football?

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:09.975
Come on.

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:11.985
You gotta... you gotta throw
harder than that.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.562
Hey!

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:20.483
Comin' in hot.

01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:24.111
Hey, dodge this.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:25.606
Hey, I'm serious, man.

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.692
Stop.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:30.329
Chill, stop!

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.468
Come on, someone's
gotta be able to hit him.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.043
Yo, Reed, you're a bitch. Hey!

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.136
Hey, this is for being
a pussy in trailer town.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:42.171
- Boom!
- Hey, watch it.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.840
- Guys, stop.
- That's for hopping in the car

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:46.004
when trash boy came.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:52.833
Where you runnin' to, bitch?

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.471
Kelly!

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:36.770
Tucker.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:43.774
Man! Hey, stop messing around!

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:47.197
Tucker.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:48.991
Shit.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Yol

01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:01.960
call the cops, bro.
Yo, come on. Tony!

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:04.442
- Tony, help.
- Put him down, put him down.

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:05.466
Fuck.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.009
Wake up.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:10.342
Tucker!

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:11.555
Wake up!

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.787
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:17.811
Wake up!

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:21.837
- Do cpr, dude.
- Bro, I don't... I don't know cpr, you do it.

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:27.613
One bully down.

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:29.782
Three to go.

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:33.285
Who's next?

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.620
Shit.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:45.714
This must be Reed's.

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:48.967
He's spared.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.459
Nelson. Nelson.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.266
What's going on?

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:00.896
Saved by the calvary.

01:05:02.774 --> 01:05:03.774
For now.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:07.903
What just happened?

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:09.694
Trash boy just fucked
Tucker's shit up.

01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:12.324
Don't know how.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.022
But we're gonna kill that freak.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.076
One, two...

01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:26.919
I'm telling you, all right?

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.583
Kelly was standing right there.

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.749
We... we saw him in the car
with you.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.729
I... I don't know how,
but it's Kelly's fault.

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:37.088
Trash boy like... drowned him

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.140
and then ran up the river.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:39.883
Yeah, like a fucking coward.

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:44.584
Reed said that you
were throwing rocks.

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:45.774
Did you hit Tucker?

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:47.477
We didn't do this to Tucker.

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:48.902
Did you?

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.693
He was our friend,
why would we do that?

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:52.984
You boys are lying
about something.

01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:57.067
Just remember that
was your friend

01:05:57.328 --> 01:05:58.328
in that body bag.

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:05.950
Having a hard time with this.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.119
I've known Kelly forever
and I just can't believe

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.291
that he could hurt anyone.

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:11.005
Well, Tony said he was there

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:12.259
and saw the whole thing.

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:14.337
Have you spoken to Kelly?

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:16.962
F

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:18.223
Hey, I... 1 gotta go.

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:20.052
Come on, ugh.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.161
Jesus!

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:41.205
I'm sorry, honey.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:42.831
Dinner's ready.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:44.368
I'm skipping dinner.

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:51.077
You must keep this
window closed,

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.257
it is not safe.

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:53.957
Especially with Kelly out there.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.720
- Are you sure you're not hungry?
- Mom, I can't eat.

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:03.383
Okay, goodnight.

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.158
Boo!

01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:22.162
Not funny.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:24.540
Sorry.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.644
What happened at
the river with Tucker?

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:31.755
Come with me.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.499
I want to tell you everything.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.804
You can't go through with this.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.400
Revenge is wrong.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.600
Murdering my mom is wrong.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.685
Kelly, you can't do this.

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:57.948
But I have to.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.202
Then just get them to confess.

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:07.117
That would make your mom proud.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.511
Class, today we are
going to be doing

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:27.054
a very exciting
chemical experiment.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.139
We are going to learn how when

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:31.058
chemicals are left alone
they are stable.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:34.933
But when they are combined,
they are reactive.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.651
Very reactive.

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:39.645
Ay yo, let's blow
some shit up, yo!

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:44.067
Mr. Miller, enough of
your hi-jinks today.

01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:47.452
J; Yo, yo, yo, I'm Tony Miller ;

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.118
j and a fuckin' mom killer j

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:52.496
j I play a fool to get
everyone's laughter

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.956
j 'cause way deep down
I'm just a white boy cracker j;

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:56.453
I warned you, trash boy.

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:58.627
Don't mess with me or
I'll fucking kill you.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:00.292
And give me my hat back,
you fuckin' bitch.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.965
- Tony! Shut up! Hey, ma...
- Give me my hat back!

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:05.301
Tony, sit down!
And Kelly, get out of here!

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:07.096
He's trying to get
you to play his game.

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:08.933
Aw, look who's the pussy
now, Nelson.

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.354
Stop!

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:11.894
Admit what you did!

01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:14.852
Okay, I am going to
call the authorities.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:17.319
Tell them.

01:09:17.694 --> 01:09:18.854
Tell them what you did!

01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:21.187
Stop this and confess!

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:26.203
Milady.

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:28.327
Should you partake in
some of my hilarity?

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.430
Should you be so inclined?

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:32.743
Would you let me stick
you with my teeny-weeny?

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.912
Get the fuck...

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.790
No, no, no, Tony.

01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:38.037
I got a funny feeling
you're about to hurt yourself.

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:39.630
Stop!

01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:41.750
- Stop it!
- Tony, don't mess with him.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:42.761
No?

01:09:43.054 --> 01:09:44.054
Tony, don't.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:45.510
- Come on, Tony.
- Fuck you!

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:46.848
Stop it!

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:12.624
Your hat.

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:18.286
Kelly, why are you doing this?

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:19.962
This was not the plan!

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.216
Oh, my god.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:25.554
Sarah.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:28.179
No!

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:36.183
Tony!

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.642
Oh, Nelson doesn't even care
about his own best friend.

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:40.504
You know, he could've
stopped this.

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:42.268
All Nelson cares
about is Nelson!

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:45.904
This isn't my fault, man.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.149
- You did this.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.325
Tony made his choice,
but you could've saved him.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:51.364
And now it's your turn.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.237
Nelson, please just confess.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:55.994
Come on, what's it
gonna be, Nelson?

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:57.701
What's it gonna be?

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:00.881
Kelly, stop!

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:03.008
Don't move.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:08.513
Oh, my god.

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:18.523
Call 911!

01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:43.321
Why are you being
so pushy to see me?

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.787
It's not safe for me to be
out here with Kelly stalking me.

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:48.046
I... I want to get Kelly back

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.336
for what he did to Tony.

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:51.348
So do I.

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:55.391
How? Right, anything
we do to him backfires.

01:11:55.686 --> 01:11:56.846
I don't know how to beat him.

01:11:57.605 --> 01:11:58.685
I might.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:00.689
Remember when I told you
what I saw at the funeral?

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.854
- Trash boy ate a vine and puked.
- So?

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:07.228
Yeah, but it's way
more than that.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:22.146
Is this a part of the cemetery?

01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:23.293
It's right up here.

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:24.749
- Shit.
- Oh!

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:26.880
- What?
- Kelly's vomit.

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:28.965
- Sick.
- Jesus.

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:32.639
It's right here.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:34.057
What, this weed?

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:35.760
Yeah, that's it.

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:38.270
Let's get it.

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:39.931
Uh, is that gonna get
on my seat?

01:12:40.982 --> 01:12:43.439
Really?
You care about your damn seats?

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:50.949
Come on, let's go.

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:11.380
Oh, Jesus. Nelson?

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.967
Nelson? There you are.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.886
Get this science experiment
shit out of here, it stinks.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:19.674
Yeah, yeah, I'll get to it, dad.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.311
Thank you. Oh, and you're
going to the field tomorrow,

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:23.565
so don't make plans.

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:26.651
School's closed.

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:28.104
Not for you, it ain't.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:29.798
Tell your brother too, will you?

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:31.562
I can't seem to
motivate that kid.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.656
Hey, Reed! There you are.

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:35.952
You're going tomorrow.

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:37.318
I didn't raise no pussies.

01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:38.785
I-I have a concussion, dad.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.655
I'll probably get a cte.

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:42.122
Cte, really?

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:44.229
You don't even know what
the hell that shit is.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.253
You're going

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:38.554
Guys, break"s over.
Let's go. Wind sprints.

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:40.047
Hustle, come on!

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:42.596
Gus, I can't protect
them out here.

01:14:42.853 --> 01:14:44.434
Relax, god.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:45.647
Listen to me.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:48.292
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:49.693
Yeah, I do.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:52.060
He's a mealy-mouth
little punk-ass kid

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.524
who for some reason
scares the shit outta you.

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:55.699
You worry too much.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:58.743
Come on, boys!

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:18.427
That's it. That's it!

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.421
There it is,
good hands, good hands.

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.035
All right, bring it back,
bring it back.

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.299
Nelson, you're gonna go long.

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:25.927
And Reed, remember,
you got a safety deep.

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:28.646
So go for the ball,
trust your safety.

01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:30.898
Come on, let's go.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.814
You know we're gonna stay
here until you get it right.

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:37.941
All right, let's try it again.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.650
You ready? Do it right
this time, same play.

01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:42.617
Come on.

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:49.072
You want to be here all day?

01:15:49.628 --> 01:15:51.164
I don't, it's hotter than hell.

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:54.459
So move your ass so we
can get done and get home.

01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:58.129
All right, his ball, go long.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:00.221
Line it up.

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:02.599
Line it up.

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:04.344
Same play, same play.

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:05.682
Let's go, let's go.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:18.820
Let's go, give me the ball.

01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:21.159
Remember... =-Gus.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:22.947
I need to talk to your boys.

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:24.245
About what?

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:25.872
Don't worry about it.

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:38.327
Boys, bring it in, come here.

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:39.886
What's going on?

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:42.586
Nelson, I found the chains

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:44.721
in the back of your
dad's pickup truck.

01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:47.256
Those are my chains.
I put them in there last night.

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:48.937
Why?

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:51.530
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:54.855
Nah. I don't know what
you're talking about, sheriff.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:56.861
What about you, Reed?

01:16:58.405 --> 01:16:59.736
I had nothing to
do with nothing.

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:01.572
Well, there you go.

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:03.785
Glad we cleared that up.

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:06.364
Thanks for coming by.

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:07.952
Check it out, guys.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.112
It's the walking
garbage disposal.

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:19.961
So fucking gross.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:22.846
But it'll be worth it.

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:26.429
Now who's ready?

01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:29.346
Look, Kelly, I had nothing to do
with your mother's death, I swear.

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:32.724
Reed, where the hell
are you going?

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:34.096
Reed, get back here!

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:38.730
I like Reed.
Never thought I'd say that.

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:41.988
Hey, I'm ready, trash boy.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:50.779
Kelly, don't listen to him.

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.076
I can help you.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.334
I won't ask again!

01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:57.620
What are you waiting for, bud?
Arrest his ass.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:14.724
Drop that drill, Kelly.

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:16.017
Not until he confesses!

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:17.859
You know what you did!

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.600
Nelson, you stubborn bastard!

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:23.855
=fuck is this?

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:25.867
Boys will be boys.

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:29.579
Fuck this!

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:32.245
Come on, shoot him, god damn it!

01:18:32.499 --> 01:18:33.659
I can handle this!

01:18:34.752 --> 01:18:35.752
Kelly!

01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:37.664
I know Nelson was involved.

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:39.919
I found the chain
he used on your trailer,

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:41.789
but you have to stop this.

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.499
This is not you.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:48.262
I know pflueger gave you
those powers.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:50.511
What do you know about that?

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:52.409
What I know is
they're not yours.

01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:54.802
They haven't been used
for a hundred years.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.305
That medicine is very dangerous.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.646
This is fuckin' bullshit, man!

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:01.217
Look what he's doing to my son!

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:03.988
Kelly, stop!

01:19:08.869 --> 01:19:09.869
Fuck this!

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:14.207
You okay?

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:28.176
Take that, you son
of a dead bitch!

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.389
What the hell is he?

01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:42.103
Shoot him now, he's weak!

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:47.822
Back up, bud. I don't want
to hurt you. Get away.

01:19:48.075 --> 01:19:49.395
- Don"t do...
- Get the fuck away.

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:57.375
This ends now.

01:19:58.627 --> 01:19:59.787
Nelson killed my mom.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:02.666
He and Tony burned
her alive in our home.

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:04.962
What is wrong with you?

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:06.252
What's wrong with all of you?

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:08.588
Goodbye, freak. Don't shoot!

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:20.638
- Man, that itches.
- Kelly, look what you've done!

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:22.186
What... look what I've done?

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:24.110
This was their doing.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:25.855
They're dead because of you!

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:28.399
No, I didn't kill anyone,
Gus chose to pull that trigger.

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:31.448
So this is what your mom
would've wanted?

01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:33.117
Would she be proud of you?

01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:36.870
Not this new Kelly.

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:39.953
I want you... to like me.

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:42.085
It's all I've ever wanted.

01:20:42.713 --> 01:20:46.001
I don't like you, Kelly.
Not anymore.

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:51.923
Kelly. Red elk and 1,

01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:56.090
we can help you bring back
the old Kelly.

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:58.217
I don't want to
be the old Kelly.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:01.019
Weak and... and powerless,
the one everyone shits on!

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:02.459
You can't have me
and have the powers!

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:03.483
No, that's not fair!

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:05.424
How do you expect
me to give this up?

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:06.814
I can control it, I promise.

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:08.446
You can't.

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:10.406
No one can.

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:14.171
Kelly, if you ever cared for me,

01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:16.075
give these powers
back to red elk.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:17.872
Cared for you?

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:21.042
I love you.

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:31.052
Drop the gun.

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:34.472
Drop the gun.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.927
That won't solve anything.

01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:39.225
Just come with me.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:27.939
Kelly. Kelly, listen to me.

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:30.434
Red elk is gonna make
vou my Kelly again, okay?

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:33.069
Okay? And then we're gonna make
you stronger than ever together,

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:34.073
I promise.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.100
You owe me a movie.

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:42.165
Yeah.

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:43.332
Yeah, I do.

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:57.256
That one's our killer, right?

01:22:59.016 --> 01:23:00.296
Well, I got my
backup right here.

01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:03.975
Let's go.

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:05.229
I don't know.

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.158
Is it working?

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:22.413
Hurry!

01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:24.624
What the hell?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.615
Kelly, let it go, let it go!

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:29.334
Don't stop!
Soon it will be free!

01:23:32.382 --> 01:23:33.382
Let it go!

01:23:33.592 --> 01:23:34.819
What's happening?

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:35.843
Keep going!

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:37.572
What's happening to him?

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:39.052
You said he'd be okay!

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:40.804
Stop it, stop it!

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:42.173
You're killing him!

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:47.447
Listen to me, Kelly. Kelly, when I
scream, you run as fast as you can.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:48.648
Okay?

01:23:50.108 --> 01:23:51.143
Stop it!

01:23:51.151 --> 01:23:52.436
He's had it too long!

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:54.317
You said we could save him.

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:55.731
It's a part of him.

01:23:56.406 --> 01:23:57.406
He must die.

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:00.574
Then I will have the power.

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:02.488
I will not kill this boy.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.611
We must bury him with pflueger.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.580
I can save him.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:13.795
Run, Kelly, run!

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:15.716
Freeze, pull it!

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:17.910
Wait, wait!

01:24:37.114 --> 01:24:39.025
No. No, no, no.

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.239
No, no, Dominique, no, no, no.

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:42.983
Stay with me. Please stay.

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.204
I'm sorry I made you come here.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.036
It's okay, I...

01:24:50.294 --> 01:24:51.414
I would do anything for you.

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:00.425
Then don't give them the power.

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:02.305
I won't.

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:06.684
I love you.

01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:09.353
I always will.

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:11.105
I love...

01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:16.569
No.

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:18.404
No, no...

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:21.234
Nol

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:27.031
no one will ever have
this power again!

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:32.415
Why did you do this to me?

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:35.119
Why!

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:40.249
This evil dies with me.

01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:44.052
With me, pflueger!

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:21.425
Do you have it?

01:26:22.719 --> 01:26:23.719
Do you have it?

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:27.390
No.

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:35.269
Ross, this town is crazy, man.

01:26:35.482 --> 01:26:37.518
Yeah, Carter, I know bro.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.353
Hey, can you turn this up?

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:40.900
- Got it.
- Aight.

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:01.375
Man, that itches.
