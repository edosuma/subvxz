07:47.874 --> 07:49.007

07:49.109 --> 07:50.508

07:50.610 --> 07:52.043

07:52.145 --> 07:53.878
he's known as a badass Batman villain,

07:53.980 --> 07:55.513
but they've crossed him over into "Arrow,"

07:55.615 --> 07:56.881

07:58.785 --> 08:00.218
she's the daughter of Ra's al Ghul.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.587
Not only that, but she
wouldn't be in that role

Does "Arrow" really follow
the comic book continuity?

Or does the show take
it in another direction

09:22.068 --> 09:23.334

them in a certain way, right?

18:30.302 --> 18:32.035

this is my stack here...

18:32.137 --> 18:33.036

- Yep.

18:33.138 --> 18:34.404
Stack 'em like this,

18:34.506 --> 18:35.839
and I-I just slam it down on here, right?

18:35.941 --> 18:37.274
Yeah, yeah, so if it starts facedown,

18:37.376 --> 18:38.609
I gotta get it that way,

18:38.711 --> 18:40.043
or if it's... vice versa.

18:40.145 --> 18:41.345
So that's the... the concept.

18:41.447 --> 18:42.713
And that was called the slammer, right?

18:42.815 --> 18:44.381
- Oh, yeah.
- That has some weight.

18:44.483 --> 18:46.350
He always won 'cause
he had a super slammer.

18:46.452 --> 18:48.118
It was... it was almost double the weight.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.187

have a juiced slammer.

- Now, when's the last time
