00:10.170 --> 00:11.467
Welcome home,
girl interrupted.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.337
Emma:
I had some issues
and I dealt with them.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.638
(Grunting)
Emma:
We survived.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.777
Aha; how, we ’re here
to help each other

00:18.780 --> 00:21.817
ﬁnd a way to get
back to normal.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.173
(Groans)

00:23.190 --> 00:25.215
Oh, my god!
It was a prank!

00:25.220 --> 00:26.289
(Ringtone playing)

00:26.290 --> 00:28.087
Hello?
How was the party?

00:28.090 --> 00:29.284
I hire torturing you.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.588
Aﬁ‘er what you did,
you deserve it.

00:31.590 --> 00:35.424
lVoah:
I think someone
helped Pioer, and I think
they’re st/l/ out there.

00:35.430 --> 00:37.352
Can ’t you see?
Its all connected

00:37.370 --> 00:40.191
You can't hide me forever.
I wouldn’thave to

00:40.200 --> 00:41.690
if you hadn ’t
blackma/led my dad.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.691
You know what?
Jake is got a plan!

00:43.710 --> 00:45.166
p

V y
W
/

00:45.170 --> 00:47.058
and your dad is gonna love me!

00:47.080 --> 00:49.833
(Screaming)

00:50.250 --> 00:54.846
Screw you!
(Screaming)

00:54.850 --> 00:58.217
Noah, what is this?
That's a pig farm.

00:58.220 --> 01:00.745
It belongs to Troy James,
Brandon's brother.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.456
Hello?
Emma, let's get out of here.

01:03.460 --> 01:07.248
(Floors creaking)
(Screaming)

01:08.730 --> 01:10.857
(Screaming)

01:16.270 --> 01:18.363
(Screams)
Are you okay?
I heard you scream.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.600
Someone is living in there.
They have pictures of me
at school,

01:20.610 --> 01:23.135
pictures of me as a kid.
They have newspaper clippings.

01:23.150 --> 01:26.677
What are you talking about?
My entire life is in there!

01:26.680 --> 01:28.545
We need to go now!

01:30.650 --> 01:32.379
(Car doors closing)

01:38.790 --> 01:42.590
Maggie:
So, this farm on pikeview road,
that's what you said, right?

01:42.600 --> 01:46.764
Yeah, yeah.
It belongs to Troy James.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.499
Yeah, I know.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.764
What?
What do you mean you know?

01:50.770 --> 01:55.332
You've been there before,
when you were very young.

01:55.340 --> 01:58.173
I told you about Troy,
Brandon's brother?

01:58.180 --> 01:59.204
Yes, I know.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.471
Well, after the killings,

02:00.480 --> 02:02.345
the jameses were
constantly harassed.

02:02.350 --> 02:06.480
They were...
They basically became outcasts.

02:06.490 --> 02:09.186
So...
So, they moved out there?

02:09.190 --> 02:11.181
Until they could find
another place to live,

02:11.190 --> 02:14.489
a place where they weren't
hated by everyone.

02:14.500 --> 02:19.267
And I couldn't abandon them,
so I would go and visit Troy
and his family,

02:19.270 --> 02:21.534
even after you were born.

02:23.770 --> 02:27.558
I remember that farm.
What?

02:27.580 --> 02:29.605
The pigs.
You remember that?

02:29.610 --> 02:34.445
Mm-hmm.
You were so young
when they moved.

02:34.450 --> 02:36.372
Mom...

02:36.390 --> 02:39.382
How could you
not tell me about this?

02:40.390 --> 02:42.278
I didn't think it mattered.

02:42.290 --> 02:45.487
(Scoffs)
Hey.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.821
So, who's living
out there now? That man?

02:48.830 --> 02:53.927
I don't know.
Why does he have all those
pictures of me on the wall?

02:53.940 --> 02:56.795
As far I know, no one's
lived there since Troy left.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.268
But we're not hiding
from anything anymore.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.832
I don't want you to be afraid.

03:04.580 --> 03:10.940
Let's go back there right now,
you and I. We'll figure it out.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.451
(Suspenseful music playing)

03:30.410 --> 03:31.559
Maggie:
Okay.

03:31.570 --> 03:33.561
(Clattering)

03:35.040 --> 03:38.976
(Emma breathing heavily)

03:55.600 --> 03:57.659
There's nothing.

03:58.770 --> 04:00.726
There's nothing in here.

04:02.340 --> 04:04.604
(Birds tweeting)

04:10.550 --> 04:12.347
Emma, you up?

04:16.020 --> 04:20.343
Look, I know last night
was confusing. I just...

04:31.400 --> 04:33.425
Kieran:
So, everything was just gone?

04:33.440 --> 04:34.896
Like he'd never existed.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.458
It makes no sense, right?

04:36.470 --> 04:40.338
Yeah. That's really weird.
You need to report it
to the cops.

04:40.340 --> 04:45.505
Yeah. So the cops can go
to a crumbling old farmhouse
in the middle of nowhere

04:45.510 --> 04:46.545
and find nothing?

04:46.550 --> 04:51.647
I would look like a total idiot.
Completely crazy.

04:54.390 --> 04:59.726
Am I completely crazy?
Am I seeing things?

05:01.030 --> 05:08.732
When my dad first died,
everything about this place
set me off.

05:09.710 --> 05:15.398
That must have been really hard,
being here by yourself.

05:15.410 --> 05:22.873
Intense. Some mornings,
I'd swear I could hear him
in the other room.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.415
That's normal weirdness.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.454
That's not...

05:28.460 --> 05:31.679
That's not seeing things
that aren't there.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.568
Did I come home too soon?

05:44.570 --> 05:48.472
Should I go back to treatment?

05:48.480 --> 05:51.574
Now, that sounds crazy.

05:51.580 --> 05:54.606
You're good, em...

05:54.620 --> 05:56.440
Right here.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.054
(Engine starts)

06:24.110 --> 06:26.203
(Engine starts)

06:36.130 --> 06:39.782
Egg-wich? Whoa! Oh, sorry.
Somebody's jumpy today.

06:39.800 --> 06:45.090
Tired, actually. I kinda worked
the creeper shift last night.

06:46.140 --> 06:49.234
Okay, look,
it's way too early for you
to be this keyed.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.504
Let it out.
Oh, no. No, it's nothing.

06:51.510 --> 06:55.731
Just an intriguing new lead
on our favorite demented
Internet troll.

06:55.740 --> 07:00.905
Aka the person
who's harassing me?
Aka Piper's accomplice.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.718
Show me.
Okay.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.918
My interview with Emma netted
a record number of comments.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.182
Feast your eyes.

07:09.190 --> 07:10.782
On what, Noah?
What am I looking at?

07:10.790 --> 07:13.588
Commenter eddiekrueger?
Not just your average fan

07:13.600 --> 07:15.522
of one of the 805'
most prolific psychos,

07:15.530 --> 07:18.226
but also a night clerk
at the Crescent palms.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.698
I still have to confirm
the lead, but this Eddie guy

07:20.700 --> 07:24.158
claims he actually saw
Piper's accomplice.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.058
Like, in the flesh.

07:26.070 --> 07:29.528
(Chuckling)
It's... it's amazing.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.869
Brooke, you were there
last night.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.575
Can't you back Emma up
on what she saw?

07:32.580 --> 07:37.142
Well, I can't speak
to the presence
of a stalker collage,

07:37.150 --> 07:38.617
or the vanishing furniture.

07:38.620 --> 07:42.750
Or the squatter?
I didn't really see anything.

07:43.090 --> 07:48.084
Brooke, what? It's nothing
that I haven't already thought.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.589
Look, you were not
making any sense

07:51.600 --> 07:54.068
when you came out
of that house last night, Emma.

07:54.070 --> 07:57.858
I'm sorry. It was...
It was weird. I was worried.

07:57.870 --> 07:59.963
Brooke...
Hey, it's okay.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.106
We all have to be honest.

08:01.110 --> 08:04.170
It's the only way we're
gonna move past this thing.

08:04.180 --> 08:08.241
It's just... you know,
you've seen things before.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.548
Will, your dad...

08:10.550 --> 08:14.008
Yeah. So, you think
that this is a hallucination.

08:14.020 --> 08:21.791
Well, given all of the insanity
that we've been through,
it's not so crazy. Right?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.598
Yeah, I guess.

08:30.870 --> 08:33.202
Hey, if you see Jake today,
will you warn me,

08:33.210 --> 08:35.804
so I can avoid him
and make him suffer?

08:35.810 --> 08:37.038
Yeah.
Noah: Ah!

08:37.050 --> 08:38.802
What up,
my lakewood sixers!

08:38.810 --> 08:41.711
Though, technically, there are
only five of us at the moment.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.214
Look, I know Jake has
probably been spilling trash
about me since we broke up,

08:46.220 --> 08:49.951
and you can just
tell me about it.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.885
What? No one's
talked to him since...

08:52.900 --> 08:54.049
Since we, like, broke up?

08:54.060 --> 08:56.699
Probably part of his bold plan
to make you suffer.

08:56.700 --> 09:01.023
One day is obnoxious and bold.
Two days is obnoxious and weird.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.258
Looks like it's working.
Come on, it's Jake.

09:03.270 --> 09:05.830
He faked mono for a week
to get out of midterms.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.970
His parents are in Mexico.
Maybe he's just laying low
at home.

09:09.980 --> 09:12.005
Brooke, have you tried
texting him?

09:12.010 --> 09:13.307
Please. Every cosmo girl knows

09:13.320 --> 09:17.177
the guy is supposed
to be the one to break
the text standoff.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.044
Wow. So modern.

09:19.050 --> 09:21.245
(Phone vibrates)

09:28.900 --> 09:33.621
(Suspenseful music playing)

09:43.250 --> 09:46.048
(Texting)

09:46.050 --> 09:49.042
The other night at the theater
wasn't enough for you, huh?

09:49.050 --> 09:51.689
Chill, dude! You're losing
your freaking mind!

09:51.690 --> 09:54.011
Stop screwing with me!

09:54.020 --> 09:55.783
I could press charges.

09:55.790 --> 09:57.758
Give me your phone.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.990
I was texting my boyfriend,
you freak!

10:05.230 --> 10:07.061
Sorry.

10:09.370 --> 10:11.133
Hey, you okay?
Because you seem...

10:11.140 --> 10:13.938
I'm fine, Noah.
I'm late for class.

10:14.740 --> 10:18.039
F.Y.I., your bestie's
a total psychotic bitch.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.974
Yeah, you'd know, right?

10:30.260 --> 10:36.153
Oh, my god. I am so sorry.
I totally forgot our tutoring
session this morning.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.368
I... I had a really crazy night
last night.

10:39.370 --> 10:43.295
No, it's fine.
You have a lot going on.
I have a lot going on.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.595
I get it...
If you're not ready.

10:44.610 --> 10:50.469
No, Zoe, I am ready.
I completely need your help
to catch up. It's just...

10:50.480 --> 10:56.749
Look, a while back,
i was going through
some pretty painful stuff,

10:56.750 --> 10:58.980
and I kinda lost my way.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.639
It happens. I get it.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.652
So, how do you get past that?

11:03.660 --> 11:07.448
You find someone smart
and you pay attention.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.223
That's what I meant
by "symbiotic,"

11:09.230 --> 11:12.768
and our tutoring is as much
for me as it is for you.

11:12.770 --> 11:16.592
So, you really think
I'm as smart as you are?

11:17.170 --> 11:20.662
(Whispering)
I used to think
you were smarter.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.675
(Takes deep breath)

11:25.680 --> 11:27.272
Say you're a zebra.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.770
You need to learn
to face the lion,

11:28.780 --> 11:31.271
but you don't want
to end up on the menu.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.212
So, what's the zebra brain do?

11:33.220 --> 11:35.688
It uses nightmares
to simulate the conflict.

11:35.690 --> 11:41.083
Makes sense.
They live their lives
in constant fear of attack...

11:41.100 --> 11:42.499
I texted Jake.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.321
I guess you're not
a cosmo girl, after all.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.422
(Sighs)
Shut up.

11:46.440 --> 11:53.369
I even told him a quick response
would get him a boob pic.
Still nothing.

11:54.110 --> 11:57.671
Weird.
I'm officially worried.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.568
Brooke, Emma,
can either of you tell us

11:59.580 --> 12:03.539
what our friends,
the scientists,
call this adaptation?

12:03.550 --> 12:05.438
Something about zebras?

12:05.450 --> 12:07.589
Yeah, but no.

12:07.590 --> 12:11.082
Together:
Threat simulation theory.

12:11.090 --> 12:14.753
Question is: If prey animals
dream of their predators,

12:14.760 --> 12:16.796
what does the predator dream of?

12:16.800 --> 12:18.620
(Scoffs)
Girl predators.

12:18.630 --> 12:23.761
The predator is us.
Human beings.

12:23.770 --> 12:25.306
Lang:
That's right, stavo.

12:25.310 --> 12:29.178
Everything we do,
how we think, how we sleep,

12:29.180 --> 12:31.671
who we sleep with,
what we kill...

12:31.680 --> 12:34.274
It's all about one thing:
Survival.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.419
When that instinct
is challenged,

12:36.420 --> 12:37.819
our brains go into overdrive.

12:37.820 --> 12:44.259
We have to meet that challenge
and beat it... or else.

12:44.790 --> 12:48.419
(School bell rings)

12:58.370 --> 13:01.464
Miss lang,
do you have a second?

13:01.480 --> 13:05.143
Emma, what's on
your lizard brain?

13:09.650 --> 13:13.313
You need someone to talk to?
Yes.

13:13.320 --> 13:17.586
How about tonight?
The grindhouse around six?

13:18.360 --> 13:22.126
Perfect.
I'll see you there.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.155
(Sighs)

13:34.740 --> 13:37.538
Nice "everything's cool" face.
That obvious?

13:37.550 --> 13:42.146
I probably shouldn't ask
if something weird happened
in the stairwell earlier, right?

13:42.150 --> 13:44.618
Just another charming encounter
with that Hayley chick.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.509
You sure this isn't like
some grade school crush

13:47.520 --> 13:49.579
she's playing out
through torment?

13:49.590 --> 13:51.751
First of all, ew.
Secondly, no.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.421
I don't think
she's into girls.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.398
Okay, good. I mean, whatever.

13:55.400 --> 13:59.461
(Sighs) I thought maybe
i was driving you nuts again,

13:59.470 --> 14:01.722
with the whole Piper's
accomplice thing.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.231
Foster's gotta foster.
(Chuckles)

14:04.240 --> 14:08.461
The question is:
What are you going to do
to chase down your big lead?

14:08.480 --> 14:10.175
I already contacted
the tipster. Checks out.

14:10.180 --> 14:13.399
Seems Piper stayed
at the Crescent palms on and off
while she was in lakewood.

14:13.420 --> 14:17.311
Eddie's saving his big
accomplice identity reveal
for my podcast.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.345
If he knew that Piper
was working with someone,

14:19.350 --> 14:20.942
why didn't he
go to the police
with this info?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.916
That's the thing.
Lakewood pd claims

14:22.920 --> 14:24.956
they have no evidence
of an accomplice, so...

14:24.960 --> 14:26.951
So, this is just conspiracy
theories gone wild.

14:26.960 --> 14:34.196
Okay, I'll choose
to take that as light ribbing,
not a full-on insult.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.565
You know...

14:35.570 --> 14:37.788
I should film it
for the website.

14:37.810 --> 14:41.735
Really? Because you seemed
sort of over the morgue lately.

14:41.740 --> 14:45.244
That was just about
not upsetting Emma.
She's fine. We're good.

14:45.250 --> 14:50.574
_ _ Yes! Yes!
BI-curlous and the virgin
officially out of retirement!

14:50.590 --> 14:54.219
I'll dust off my costume.
Aw. So, you did keep it.

14:54.220 --> 14:55.949
(Both laugh)

15:08.900 --> 15:11.789
Sorry, sorry.
I did not see you there.

15:11.810 --> 15:15.405
I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

15:15.410 --> 15:20.438
This lakewood days
seems like a big deal, huh?

15:20.450 --> 15:22.543
Yeah, it is.

15:22.550 --> 15:24.415
So, what did you sign up for?

15:24.420 --> 15:28.789
The car wash
or the pancake breakfast?

15:28.790 --> 15:31.418
I actually didn't sign up
for anything yet.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.523
Maybe I should.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.854
Are you new here?

15:38.670 --> 15:41.491
And by that you mean...?

15:41.500 --> 15:44.037
Do you go to school here?

15:44.040 --> 15:49.672
No, Emma,
but I'm thinking about it.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.547
How do you know my name?

15:52.550 --> 15:54.871
Doesn't everyone?

16:05.990 --> 16:07.321
According to Denise,

16:07.330 --> 16:09.958
it is critical
that we stay visible

16:09.970 --> 16:11.392
headed into the election.

16:11.400 --> 16:15.063
We need to get out there
and make the most
of lakewood days.

16:15.070 --> 16:18.836
Brooke, are you
listening to me?
Yes, daddy.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.058
There's a lakewood days
photo-op tonight

16:21.080 --> 16:22.729
at the lady of the lake event.

16:22.740 --> 16:25.675
You've signed up already, yes?

16:25.680 --> 16:27.409
Yes.
Good.

16:27.420 --> 16:31.345
(Sighs)
I suppose it wouldn't kill me.

16:35.460 --> 16:36.916
(Sighs)

16:36.930 --> 16:37.988
Bye.

16:37.990 --> 16:40.481
Bye, sweetheart.

16:52.770 --> 16:56.069
(Phone beeps, line ringing)

16:58.910 --> 17:02.016
You have reached
the voice ma/lhoX
of ”the Jake. ”

17:02.020 --> 17:06.081
Aﬁ‘er the tone,
please record your message.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.754
Kieran. Sheriff acosta.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.628
First off, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about your father.

17:18.630 --> 17:21.098
I heard he was a good man.
Thanks.

17:21.100 --> 17:23.432
And that's what
brought you here?

17:23.440 --> 17:25.806
No, we've had
some recent complaints

17:25.810 --> 17:27.869
from your neighbors
about the noise.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.734
You throw a lot of parties.
Kieran!

17:29.740 --> 17:33.403
Were your ears burning?
We were just chatting about you.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.878
When I called
your legal guardian here
about the complaints,

17:36.890 --> 17:40.883
I discovered that aunt Tina
doesn't even live in lakewood.

17:40.890 --> 17:42.881
She lives close enough.

17:42.890 --> 17:43.982
Yeah, and some would say

17:43.990 --> 17:46.982
that you're close enough to 18
to live alone here,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.456
but that would be illegal.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.758
Sheriff, I promise you,
i check in on Kieran

17:50.770 --> 17:51.794
every chance I get.

17:51.800 --> 17:56.760
He's really been through it.
This is where he lived
with his father.

17:56.770 --> 18:02.538
Who, I'm sure would want his son
to live with a legal guardian.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.668
You don't know anything
about my father.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.648
But we understand
what you're saying, Sll‘.

18:07.650 --> 18:10.141
So, don't worry.
I'll resolve the situation.

18:10.150 --> 18:14.416
That's all I wanted to hear.
Thank you.

18:20.930 --> 18:25.765
What the hell, Kieran?
You promised not to turn
this place into party central.

18:25.770 --> 18:26.919
I didn't.
Uh...

18:26.940 --> 18:31.832
The trash can was
overflowing with beer bottles
when the sheriff got here.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.161
I thought you were
more responsible than that.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.579
(Laughs)
I'm sorry.

18:35.580 --> 18:39.038
It's just weird
to hear you talk
about responsibility.

18:39.050 --> 18:40.540
Well, you can laugh about it,

18:40.550 --> 18:43.519
but that stipend I get
for being your guardian

18:43.520 --> 18:45.044
paid my bills.

18:45.050 --> 18:49.749
So, now, what was a win-win...
Is a mess.

18:50.090 --> 18:53.480
I'm gonna have to fix this.
(Sighs)

18:53.960 --> 18:56.121
(Phone rings)

18:56.130 --> 19:00.692
Hey!
Kieran:
Hey, em. I don’tknow
how to tell you this, but...

19:00.700 --> 19:04.534
It looks like
I'm moving to Atlanta.

19:04.540 --> 19:09.876
Yeah. Aunt 77'na says
it has to happen right away.

19:11.950 --> 19:15.078
Maggie:
Honey, you can Skype him.
You can always visit.

19:15.080 --> 19:22.043
Yeah, our attempt
at long distance was
already an epic fail, so...

19:22.620 --> 19:26.021
I finally had someone
i can talk to.

19:27.560 --> 19:30.859
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
No, it's all right.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.929
We're having a hard time.

19:32.930 --> 19:36.764
I just don't think that you know
what I'm going through.

19:36.770 --> 19:38.761
I'm trying to understand.

19:38.770 --> 19:43.833
Look, I know how important
Kieran is to you.

19:44.050 --> 19:47.599
How can I help?
I don't know.

19:47.620 --> 19:53.217
I don't think
that there's anything
anyone can do to fix this.

20:01.030 --> 20:01.928
(Door opens)

20:01.930 --> 20:06.321
(Phone ringing faintly,
faint police radio chatter)

20:06.330 --> 20:11.290
Hi_. I_would like to file
a mIssmg persons report.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.631
Okay. Have a seat.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.341
What are you doing?
Homework.

20:27.360 --> 20:31.148
In the police station?
That's odd.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.856
My dad makes me
come here after school.

20:33.860 --> 20:37.023
(Sighs)
What are you doing?

20:37.030 --> 20:43.731
Waiting for your dad
so I can report my wayward
ex-boyfriend missing.

20:43.740 --> 20:48.063
No response to your
boob pic promise, huh?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.604
(Scoffs)

20:49.610 --> 20:53.068
It's my fault for discussing
my life in psych class.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.298
I mean, I should
be worried though, right?

20:55.320 --> 20:59.040
I mean, I have no way
of getting in touch
with his parents,

20:59.050 --> 21:00.881
and I haven't spoken
to him in two days.

21:00.890 --> 21:04.951
You're talking
about Jake Fitzgerald.
Number six.

21:04.960 --> 21:10.296
That's your boyfriend, right?
I know all you lakewood sixers.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.666
You numbered us?
That's not creepy.

21:12.670 --> 21:18.233
Noah foster coined the phrase.
I just added the ranking.

21:20.640 --> 21:25.907
Okay. So...
What number am I?

21:25.910 --> 21:29.368
I'd go as high
as number four.

21:29.380 --> 21:32.713
(Scoffs)
Are you kidding?

21:32.720 --> 21:34.187
I'm at least three.

21:34.190 --> 21:35.680
Noah's number three.

21:35.690 --> 21:37.885
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

21:37.890 --> 21:40.029
He was the investigative force.

21:40.030 --> 21:42.999
I was stabbed
and left in a freezer!

21:43.000 --> 21:44.058
(Phone dings)

21:44.070 --> 21:45.719
Yeah, I know.

21:45.730 --> 21:47.368
Thought it would
have had a bigger impact.

21:47.370 --> 21:49.338
What is that supposed to mean?

21:49.340 --> 21:51.934
Woman:
The sheriff will see you now.

21:56.210 --> 21:58.906
(Phone dings, vibrates)

22:01.120 --> 22:03.941
(Sighs)
Finally answered, huh?

22:03.950 --> 22:06.043
He must really love you.

22:06.050 --> 22:07.938
(Chuckles)

22:09.260 --> 22:13.720
All you people who think
you know everything
about the lakewood six,

22:13.730 --> 22:18.895
or whatever it is you want
to call us, you don't know us.

22:18.900 --> 22:21.425
(Whispering)
Not really.

22:26.410 --> 22:28.207
(Door closes)

22:30.380 --> 22:31.870
(Clears throat)

22:31.880 --> 22:33.905
(Knocking)

22:35.120 --> 22:41.810
Hi, Tina.
It's Maggie, Emma's mom.
We met at Clark's funeral.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.380
Maggie, of course.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.152
You were so special
to my big brother.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.424
Oh, thank you
for saying that.

22:50.430 --> 22:54.491
Do you have a minute
that we can talk about Kieran?

22:54.500 --> 22:56.491
Sure. Come in!

23:00.110 --> 23:03.170
I mean...
I saw the photographs.

23:03.180 --> 23:08.106
They... they seemed to be there,
as real as anything.

23:08.120 --> 23:12.489
Even though it seems illogical
that they would be there?

23:12.490 --> 23:14.139
Yeah. I guess. Yes.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.153
Hallucinations and paranoia
are extremely common with PTSD.

23:18.160 --> 23:23.154
It's not something to be
too worried about, really.
You'll pull through.

23:23.160 --> 23:29.838
Yeah, you sound, um,
just like my therapist
at the treatment center.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.137
Is that a bad thing?
No.

23:31.140 --> 23:35.406
I mean, I don't know. Maybe.
Woman: Emma and Kristin?

23:35.410 --> 23:37.878
Um, I'll get it.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.317
Emma: Thanks.

23:55.860 --> 23:59.057
(Breathing nervously)

24:04.840 --> 24:06.808
Piper!

24:06.810 --> 24:08.300
(Gasps)

24:08.310 --> 24:11.871
(Hyperventilating)

24:18.120 --> 24:21.783
Well, it should. Someone
should invent an app for that.

24:21.790 --> 24:26.659
What made me think I could even
set foot in this place again?

24:26.660 --> 24:31.051
This is where
Piper and I first met.

24:33.900 --> 24:36.539
She sat right over there,

24:36.540 --> 24:39.668
and I let her
become my friend.

24:39.670 --> 24:40.659
I trusted her.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.705
Emma, you didn't know
any better.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.974
It's not bad to trust,
to be vulnerable.

24:44.980 --> 24:50.941
Am I gonna have a meltdown
every time I see a brunette
drinking a nonfat mocha?

24:50.950 --> 24:53.316
Don't let her ruin your life.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.016
This is what happens.

24:57.060 --> 25:01.759
It all closes in on you,
and then you can't get out.

25:01.760 --> 25:05.924
It happened to my dad.
Is it happening to me?

25:05.930 --> 25:09.661
Am I gonna be
this screwed-up person
for the rest of my life?

25:09.670 --> 25:13.106
You won't be. You just
have to work to not be.

25:13.110 --> 25:15.203
You're not a victim, Emma.
You're a survivor.

25:15.210 --> 25:20.000
Piper has taken
so much from you.
don't let her take any more.

25:20.010 --> 25:23.969
She's gone. That was not
her sitting over there.
Piper is gone.

25:23.990 --> 25:29.883
Whatever you need to do
to prove that to yourself...
Is worth doing.

25:36.900 --> 25:40.063
Woman:
that flicker
you tried to hide

25:40.070 --> 25:45.793
its there in your sm/le,
in the corners of your mouth

25:45.810 --> 25:47.732
I see it in your eyes

25:47.740 --> 25:50.208
you don ’t even know
its there

25:50.210 --> 25:54.806
so you forget to hide

25:54.820 --> 25:59.109
I know its hard
for you to love again

25:59.120 --> 26:02.908
hard for you to trust again

26:07.860 --> 26:12.763
(knocking)
(Footsteps approaching)

26:14.070 --> 26:16.129
What are you doing here?

26:16.140 --> 26:20.759
Emma? Hey.
This is my cousin, Eli.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.931
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.009
This is my aunt Tina.
This is Emma.

26:26.010 --> 26:28.672
Maggie's daughter, right?
Hey, there.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.419
Hi.

26:29.420 --> 26:35.313
Uh, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

26:36.160 --> 26:39.049
They seem interesting.
That's one word for it.

26:39.060 --> 26:40.721
I can't believe
you're leavmg.

26:40.730 --> 26:42.823
Your mom came by
and talked to Tina.
Did she?

26:42.830 --> 26:45.094
Yeah. Said she gave her
a lot to think about,

26:45.100 --> 26:46.795
whatever that means.
Really?

26:46.800 --> 26:48.825
I can't believe my fate
rests in Tina's hands.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.298
I know you don't have
much time left, but there's
something I want to do.

26:52.310 --> 26:57.737
I don't want to do it
with anyone but you. I don't
want to do it alone. I mean...

26:57.750 --> 27:02.175
I guess I really have to do it
now or never. So, uh...

27:02.180 --> 27:06.844
Can we go for a drive?
Yeah.

27:15.130 --> 27:17.428
This place is nice.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.989
We can't just up
and move, Eli.
Yeah?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.024
(Car engine starts)

27:22.040 --> 27:24.736
We live in a crappy
one-bedroom apartment

27:24.740 --> 27:27.004
with your loser boyfriend.

27:27.010 --> 27:29.069
It's not like you have a job.

27:29.080 --> 27:32.470
We could stay
in this big house rent free.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.402
Okay, things aren't perfect.
I'm sorry.

27:34.420 --> 27:38.914
No, they're not.
They're horrible.

27:39.220 --> 27:42.815
Woman:
I wﬂl not lie

27:42.820 --> 27:46.278
I see the way you feel

27:48.800 --> 27:51.997
no need to hide

27:52.000 --> 27:55.959
the keepers gonna keep

27:55.970 --> 27:57.835
(chuckles)

27:58.170 --> 28:00.434
(Knocking on door)
Come in.

28:00.440 --> 28:04.069
Starting to feel the heat

28:04.080 --> 28:07.299
Brooke, honey,
what are you wearing?

28:07.310 --> 28:08.242
It's a dress.

28:08.250 --> 28:09.774
Well, it's way too much.

28:09.780 --> 28:12.749
The photo-op's in 20 minutes.
You have to go change.

28:12.750 --> 28:15.082
Oh, daddy, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to flake on that.

28:15.090 --> 28:19.481
That is unacceptable.
This is a very important
moment for the family.

28:19.490 --> 28:22.857
You made a promise, Brooke.
Maddoxes keep their promises.

28:22.860 --> 28:26.193
(Scoffs) Do you really want
to get into this family's legacy

28:26.200 --> 28:27.519
of lying and breaking promises?

28:27.540 --> 28:31.761
I am going to spend
the rest of my life
apologizing for my mistakes.

28:31.770 --> 28:36.798
I'm trying to make up for them.
Brooke, what could possibly
be more important?

28:36.810 --> 28:39.870
Do you really want to know?

28:41.220 --> 28:44.417
I'm going to see
my boyfriend...

28:44.420 --> 28:48.015
Jake. Yeah, that Jake.

28:48.020 --> 28:51.911
We've been seeing each other
ever since you got arrested,
andits".

28:51.930 --> 28:54.080
(Sighs)
It's basically amazing.

28:54.100 --> 28:59.128
Brooke, that boy hurt us
very much.

28:59.130 --> 29:00.791
No, he hurt you.

29:00.800 --> 29:04.099
All you do is talk about
how much you've changed.

29:04.110 --> 29:09.161
Well, so has Jake.
He's a good person, dad.

29:09.510 --> 29:11.978
And I care about him.

29:13.450 --> 29:14.576
I can't help it.

29:14.580 --> 29:19.483
This is my life,
not some stupid campaign.

29:20.390 --> 29:22.312
I'm sorry, daddy.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.589
(Grabs phone)

29:29.930 --> 29:31.352
(Sighs)

29:55.190 --> 29:58.079
You sure this isn't too soon?

29:59.490 --> 30:01.287
It's just a dock.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.389
Will you wait here?

30:12.410 --> 30:14.332
I won't move.

30:14.340 --> 30:18.436
(Suspenseful music playing)

31:02.160 --> 31:08.258
(Suspenseful music playing)

31:24.010 --> 31:32.941
Man:
this Is the start
of how it all ends

31:35.060 --> 31:38.689
I ’m surrounded by l/ght

31:38.690 --> 31:42.285
and I have everything
but nothing at all

31:42.300 --> 31:46.498
everything I touch
turns to gold

31:46.500 --> 31:48.593
ooh

31:50.140 --> 31:56.067
it took some time
to d/sco ver...

31:56.080 --> 31:58.435
is this okay?

31:58.750 --> 32:02.277
I hate it. It's so ugly.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.977
It makes you
more beautiful to me.

32:07.220 --> 32:11.213
I ’m surrounded by l/ght

32:11.230 --> 32:14.256
people crave
to watch me fall

32:14.260 --> 32:19.050
everything I touch
turns to gold

32:20.600 --> 32:23.239
crazy chick was here
all the time.

32:23.240 --> 32:29.236
Usually alone, but once,
i saw her arguing...
With a girl.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.128
A girl accomplice?
Holy plot twist!

32:31.150 --> 32:32.674
Do you remember
what she looked like?

32:32.680 --> 32:36.343
Yeah, she had
that creepy j-horror hair
and those weirdo glasses.

32:36.350 --> 32:40.719
No, not Piper.
The accomplice.
(Phone rings)

32:40.720 --> 32:43.086
Crescent palms.
Distorted voice:
Play it cool, scumbag,

32:43.090 --> 32:46.651
or housekeeping wﬂl
be scraping your bone
fragments off the ce/ling.

32:46.660 --> 32:51.620
What?
And don ’t make any stupid faces
to do him of either, or...

32:51.630 --> 32:56.124
I'll strangle you
with your own intestines.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.029
I can see you.

33:00.540 --> 33:03.236
Uh, yes.

33:05.450 --> 33:06.644
I was wrong.
(Chuckles)

33:06.650 --> 33:09.676
I, uh... I don't really
remember anything.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.672
I should get back to work.
You've been talking to me
all night.

33:12.690 --> 33:17.810
And you just said...
This interview's over. Sorry.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.258
Good boy.

33:32.270 --> 33:34.431
Hey! Hey.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.237
Well, well.
If it isn't my tardy sidekick.

33:36.240 --> 33:40.199
Sorry. Got tricked
into the butter pump
cleaning duty at the theater.

33:40.210 --> 33:43.418
Man cannot live
on toppings alone.
Yeah. So, what'd I miss?

33:43.420 --> 33:47.140
The clerk was on the verge
of spilling his guts,
and then, he just...

33:47.150 --> 33:49.618
He just froze, like he'd seen
the dark eye of Sauron.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.554
Jackass probably made
the whole thing up.

33:51.560 --> 33:55.087
No, I'm clearly onto something.
Before his personality split,

33:55.100 --> 33:58.422
Eddie told me about
this storage unit
the motel owns

33:58.430 --> 33:59.988
just a few blocks away
on clearview,

34:00.000 --> 34:01.558
where they keep all the crap
guests leave behind.

34:01.570 --> 34:04.562
He thinks there's stuff in there
that might belong to Piper.

34:04.570 --> 34:07.164
Right, 'cause the cops
would have let that slide.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.660
Piper didn't stay here
all the time.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.636
It's possible the cops
didn't even know about it.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.608
I mean, I could be
the only one onto this!

34:12.610 --> 34:15.340
I arranged to check it out
first thing in the morning.

34:15.350 --> 34:19.571
Figured you'd want to be there.
Film the big reveal?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.978
Wouldn't miss it.

34:28.460 --> 34:30.599
Tina: A little late though,
don't you think?

34:30.600 --> 34:32.750
Making the most
of the time we have left.

34:32.770 --> 34:35.466
Tina: Hey, so, I've been
doing some serious thinking,

34:35.470 --> 34:39.190
and I have an obligation
to my brother.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.563
I gotta do right by him.

34:40.570 --> 34:43.004
Actually, Emma, your mom
stepped up and offered

34:43.010 --> 34:45.069
to take Kieran in.
She did what?

34:45.080 --> 34:48.072
Looks like you won't be moving
to Atlanta, after all.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.741
I'm gonna live with Emma?
Oh, no!

34:49.750 --> 34:51.411
God, no! I'd never
let that happen.

34:51.420 --> 34:53.615
No, I'm just...
I've just come to my senses

34:53.620 --> 34:56.612
and realized I've got
to step up for my nephew.

34:56.620 --> 35:00.522
You know w_hat_I mean?
We're movmg In here.

35:01.100 --> 35:04.024
I guess I'll see you
at school?

35:04.530 --> 35:05.724
(Chuckles)

35:05.730 --> 35:09.393
You sure you want
to walk home?
Yeah.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.391
Man:
I fly away now,
promise you to wave

35:11.410 --> 35:15.267
fly with the angels
of my 200

35:15.280 --> 35:18.477
try reaching out
at the mid moon

35:18.480 --> 35:20.345
ruin clouds, do it now

35:20.350 --> 35:24.411
good night, Emma.
Text me when you get home.

35:24.420 --> 35:27.116
High with the feeling
in this f/ume

35:27.120 --> 35:30.351
try swimming out
at the mid moon

35:30.360 --> 35:33.284
ruin clouds, do it now

35:33.290 --> 35:35.724
wave on through it

35:35.730 --> 35:37.459
(engine starts)

35:37.460 --> 35:43.069
(Suspenseful music playing)

35:44.070 --> 35:46.538
(Phone ringing)

35:48.240 --> 35:50.128
Hey! Everything okay?

35:50.140 --> 35:53.746
Yes, mom, I'm fine.
You are awesome.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.809
I just heard what
you did for Kieran.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.310
I don't think it worked.

35:57.320 --> 36:00.187
No, mom, it worked.
Kieran's staying.

36:00.190 --> 36:03.250
They're all staying,
which is weird, I guess, but...

36:03.260 --> 36:06.388
That's incredible.
Yeah.

36:07.090 --> 36:13.620
And I think that we should
have dinner together tonight,
just you and me.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.325
We should talk.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.661
I'd love that.

36:17.670 --> 36:19.592
Bye.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.362
Bye.

36:28.880 --> 36:32.668
(Suspenseful music playing)

36:54.410 --> 36:57.231
(Tires screeching)

36:58.180 --> 37:01.399
Why are you following me?

37:05.350 --> 37:08.615
(Panﬂng)

37:17.360 --> 37:19.191
Emma.

37:20.230 --> 37:21.663
Dad?

37:22.870 --> 37:26.499
(Crying)

37:26.510 --> 37:28.967
Are you real?
I was just trying

37:28.980 --> 37:34.304
to figure out the best way
to approach you, you know...

37:34.310 --> 37:35.709
To talk to you...

37:35.720 --> 37:40.419
To let you know
that I'm back here in lakewood.

37:42.290 --> 37:43.985
Okay.

37:43.990 --> 37:46.754
Okay, that's... that's done.

37:46.760 --> 37:50.321
I know there's
no forgiving me...

37:50.330 --> 37:52.298
For anything.

37:52.500 --> 37:57.790
I just finally thought that
i needed to be here for you.

37:59.240 --> 38:06.009
And whatever happens next...
Is your decision.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.988
(Phone vibrates)

38:37.380 --> 38:39.007
(Scoffs)

38:44.280 --> 38:48.910
Eddie's voice:
I saw her arguing with a girl.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.425
Welcome back, horror fans.

38:58.430 --> 39:02.423
Wish I had an exciting reveal
for you tonight, but...

39:02.440 --> 39:07.537
In my humble opinion,
suspense is underrated.

39:07.740 --> 39:10.834
Noah:
The thing about the truth is...

39:12.050 --> 39:14.746
its hard to pin down.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.638
Its hot. ..

39:19.650 --> 39:20.912
and cold.

39:20.920 --> 39:27.029
You hope its one thing,
but deep down, you know
its something else.

39:27.030 --> 39:30.796
It's dad. He's back.

39:32.500 --> 39:35.560
Noah:
Of course I want there
to be something amazing

39:35.570 --> 39:39.097
when I open that locker
tomorrow...

39:41.410 --> 39:43.605
(Suspenseful music playing)

39:43.610 --> 39:44.872
(Sighsl gags)

39:44.880 --> 39:49.704
but part of me knows,
when I do finally get
my big reveal,

39:49.720 --> 39:52.974
I'm not gonna like what I find.

40:16.810 --> 40:18.937
Jake.

40:24.020 --> 40:26.648
(Suspenseful music playing)
