00:23.123 --> 00:24.715
Next time I'll handle him myself. How?

00:27.560 --> 00:29.551
Why did you try
to kill Michael?

00:29.629 --> 00:31.620
Because the poison
didn't work.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.599
If I didn't get the one with
the poison in it, Cindy did.

00:34.667 --> 00:36.225
Michael, I've isolated
the poison.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.805
Frail is a peculiar way to describe
an orchid that can kill a man...

00:39.873 --> 00:41.704
Sorry I can't give you
the antidote.

00:42.308 --> 00:44.435
Renard still has the antidote,
and I'm guessing...

00:44.511 --> 00:46.445
he's on his way back
to LA right about now.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.140
I'm surprised
you're still with us, Michael.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.545
Take off. Now!

00:49.749 --> 00:51.944
KITT, we've got to stop them.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.689
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

01:07.767 --> 01:10.258
into the dangerous world
of a man...

01:10.336 --> 01:12.065
who does not exist.

01:20.046 --> 01:22.014
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.082 --> 01:24.744
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.818 --> 01:26.843
the helpless, the powerless...

01:26.920 --> 01:30.117
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.466
Still here?

03:25.538 --> 03:28.735
Hey, what a better place
to watch the parade, huh?

03:29.142 --> 03:32.305
Parade or circus? As long
as there is music, who cares?

03:32.378 --> 03:36.974
Tell me something, you ever relax, put
on some skates and ride the boardwalk?

03:38.952 --> 03:42.353
If that's an invitation, I'll
even bring the ghetto blaster.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.784
Well, I'll see you later.
It's show time, must go.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.383
You got a date.

03:56.903 --> 03:57.995
Phew!

04:12.485 --> 04:15.249
Michael, before you trade me
in for a pair of skates...

04:15.321 --> 04:16.982
don't forget why we're here.

04:17.055 --> 04:21.083
I haven't forgotten.
Just hope this guy shows up.

04:33.906 --> 04:36.136
Michael,
what on earth is this?

04:37.644 --> 04:40.238
Looks like the boardwalk
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.248
And what exactly
is an Arnold Schwarzenegger?

04:44.617 --> 04:46.949
Wait a minute.
We got a van, pal.

04:48.321 --> 04:51.085
It matches the one our
informant described, Michael.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.352
Okay, let's go undercover.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.725
All right,
scan what's inside.

05:02.068 --> 05:04.298
A half-dozen unmarked cartons.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.866
Looks like steel canisters.

05:09.275 --> 05:11.743
Filled with HCN,
hydrogen cyanide.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.506
A compound
when mixed with water...

05:13.579 --> 05:16.343
could wipe out the entire
population of a small town.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.748
Michael.
Yeah, I know, I see him.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.451
Do you think
he's our chemical caterer?

05:22.689 --> 05:25.658
No, pal, I think
he's just our delivery boy.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.626
Well, what do we have here?

05:40.106 --> 05:42.131
The resident Fidel Castro.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.244
Michael, if he drives off
with those chemicals...

05:50.316 --> 05:52.341
there's no telling
where on earth they'll end up.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.909
I know, I just wanna
catch him in the act.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.922
It's not time to break up
the party just yet.

06:08.868 --> 06:13.430
If you don't mind, Arnold, would you
please get both dumbbells off my hood?

06:15.441 --> 06:17.739
Hey, there's only one dumbbell
on your hood.

06:17.810 --> 06:21.678
Now there's only one dumbbell on my
hood, and would you kindly take it off?

06:21.748 --> 06:24.148
KITT,
would you get off this kick?

06:30.089 --> 06:33.820
Whoever you are in there,
you'd better be pretty big.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.663
It's time.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.364
We've been made.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.377
All right,
put up the window.

07:00.219 --> 07:01.345
Hey, it's squeezing me!

07:01.521 --> 07:02.681
Your delivery days are over.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.189
Hey, I got souvenirs here.
Take a look.

07:09.896 --> 07:10.988
KITT!

07:15.234 --> 07:16.326
Is she all right?

07:16.402 --> 07:18.893
The hospital, buddy.
Scan her vitals.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.933
I'm sorry, Michael,
but it's too late.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.241
Too late?
She's dead.

07:27.313 --> 07:30.749
There's nothing more you or
anyone else can do for her.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.761
Devon,
she was only 20 years old.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.232
She just came in
from St. Louis a week ago.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.031
Yes, I know, Michael,
I'm terribly sorry.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.204
We're all sorry,
but she's dead.

07:53.272 --> 07:55.797
The worst thing is that the
only information we could get...

07:55.875 --> 07:59.777
from the one you picked up was
his name, rank, and serial number.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.780
He's a member
of a quasi-military group...

08:01.848 --> 08:05.113
dedicated to overthrowing
the island of Mandominow.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.843
A spot on the Pacific
no larger than Venice Beach.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.412
So you're telling me we're no closer
to this broker of chemical warfare...

08:11.491 --> 08:13.925
than we were when we started. Not true.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.518
At least we know what one
of his people looks like.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.190
What he looks like,
but not who he is.

08:19.532 --> 08:22.194
KITT ran the photo we took of
him through his image databank...

08:22.268 --> 08:24.236
but he couldn't get
a positive identification.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.134
You get the license plate
number on the van?

08:26.205 --> 08:27.638
Yeah, we had better luck
with that one.

08:27.707 --> 08:31.234
It's registered to a delivery
service here in town. Keller Brothers.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.871
The only thing is it appears
to be a legitimate company.

08:34.947 --> 08:38.508
And as far as we know, the van
could've been stolen from them.

08:38.583 --> 08:42.212
I learned a long time ago
everything isn't what it appears.

08:42.321 --> 08:43.413
I wanna check it out.

08:43.489 --> 08:46.720
Michael, I know how important
this case is to you...

08:46.792 --> 08:49.955
but may I be so bold
as to recommend caution?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.498
Devon, you can recommend
anything you want...

08:52.565 --> 08:54.430
but that poison gas
was meant for me.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.268
Michael, I understand
your anger...

08:57.336 --> 08:58.826
but you really
should try to relax.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.497
Your stress level is alarming.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.939
Yeah, maybe I should
take up weight lifting...

09:03.009 --> 09:04.943
like your friend
on the beach, huh?

09:05.011 --> 09:07.571
Your attempt at humor
is an excellent idea, Michael.

09:07.647 --> 09:12.141
Laughter is a known tension reliever.
Perhaps I should tell you some jokes.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.548
You're going to tell jokes?
Why not?

09:14.620 --> 09:16.611
I've done a lot of research
on humor.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.213
For instance...

09:18.524 --> 09:22.153
the other night I was parked
in a garage that was so small...

09:22.228 --> 09:24.093
the mice were hunchbacked.

09:24.163 --> 09:25.858
KITT, that is terrible.

09:25.932 --> 09:30.198
Michael, is my act dying? No, but
it's not going to Vegas either.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.367
We're on duty.
Stay on top of it.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.554
How'd you get in here?
The door.

09:57.129 --> 09:58.824
I thought it was locked.

09:58.898 --> 10:02.595
Locked? Why would your door be
locked during business hours?

10:03.569 --> 10:05.730
It's a jungle out there.
That's a very good reason.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.670
Hi, my name is Michael Knight.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.402
I'm looking for the person
in charge of this place.

10:10.476 --> 10:13.968
Sonny says I'm supposed to ask
everybody what company they work for.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.411
Come on in.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.717
I doubt that Sonny's
ever heard of us.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.446
I work for
a nonprofit organization...

10:21.520 --> 10:23.488
called the Foundation
for Law and Government.

10:23.556 --> 10:27.652
Nonprofit? You're right, I
doubt Sonny's ever heard of you.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.556
Yeah?
Sonny.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.157
Yes,
there's a Michael Knight here.

10:35.234 --> 10:38.328
He's with the Foundation
for Law and Government.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.266
Law and Government?

10:40.439 --> 10:44.170
Okay, tell him I'll be right out.
I'm just finishing up something.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.914
He won't be long.
Thanks.

10:55.021 --> 10:57.148
KITT, is that someone
coming or going?

10:57.223 --> 11:00.056
It's Rosemary, and why are
you talking to your arm?

11:00.126 --> 11:01.286
It's a van, Michael.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.157
Loaded and getting ready
to leave the premises.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.890
Come back anytime.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.446
Let's get him!

11:58.284 --> 12:02.084
All right, get him on the infrared
tracking scope and scan the cargo for me.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.850
He's got a three-block lead.

12:07.927 --> 12:10.828
And, Michael, that van is loaded
with those horrible chemicals.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.730
All right,
three blocks and closing.

12:26.479 --> 12:30.472
Let's not push him too hard.
That van's a rolling bomb.

12:59.211 --> 13:00.769
I think we've got him,
Michael.

13:01.147 --> 13:03.945
I think that's open
for discussion.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.154
KITT, what's he heading for?

13:11.223 --> 13:14.090
Open traffic. And there's a
school at the end of the road.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.491
Michael,
if those chemicals...

13:15.594 --> 13:17.494
Don't even say it.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.795
Michael,
there's no one at the wheel.

13:20.866 --> 13:24.393
I figured as much. Draw a
bead on the van, will you, pal?

13:28.974 --> 13:32.000
I've got him.
All right. Fire Microlock.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.879
Any sign of our driver? I'm
afraid not. He's out of range.

13:51.630 --> 13:56.090
Why is it that I can always count on
you to fret over the most minute details?

13:56.669 --> 13:59.604
Because careless people in my
position do not survive very long.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.329
Nor mine, Colonel.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.205
Let me assure you that the
safety of this shipment...

14:04.276 --> 14:06.506
is as important to me
as it is to you.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.042
You have nothing
to worry about.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.083
That is what I told our
President before my military coup.

14:13.552 --> 14:16.316
Touche.
Have a good day, Colonel.

14:17.723 --> 14:20.283
A case of nerves?
With good reason.

14:21.227 --> 14:24.219
You see, for the Colonel,
failure means death.

14:26.232 --> 14:27.722
Odd, isn't it?

14:27.833 --> 14:31.462
That something so frail,
so beautiful...

14:31.537 --> 14:34.267
should mean so much
to a man like Faisur.

14:35.074 --> 14:38.134
A man so dedicated
to violence and destruction.

14:39.111 --> 14:42.774
Frail is a peculiar way to describe
an orchid that can kill a man...

14:42.848 --> 14:45.316
without leaving a trace
of its poison.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.909
Not too unlike
some women I've known.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.379
Present company excluded,
of course.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.754
We've got trouble, Renard.

14:55.828 --> 14:59.229
We? And what indiscretion
did we commit this time?

14:59.431 --> 15:02.423
There is a plainclothes cop,
Michael Knight...

15:02.534 --> 15:05.162
he's been snooping around and
yesterday, he broke up a sale...

15:05.237 --> 15:07.296
then he found the warehouse.
I had to clear out, man.

15:07.373 --> 15:10.501
It's a total loss. I had to
ditch the truck and everything.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.905
What makes you think
he's a cop?

15:13.279 --> 15:17.113
I was running stash when the other
guys my age were trading baseball cards.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.649
I can smell a cop.

15:18.717 --> 15:21.743
He says he's from
the Law Foundation.

15:23.155 --> 15:26.318
Foundation for Law and Government? Yeah.

15:26.392 --> 15:29.657
You know him?
An associate of mine did.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.623
As he described it, it was a
rather unpleasant experience.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.188
I hope you didn't
leave any clues.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.791
I didn't exactly have time
to tidy up.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.127
That's too bad.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.706
Still, the loss of a truck
and one warehouse...

15:41.774 --> 15:44.265
certainly won't put us
out of business...

15:44.910 --> 15:46.104
nor will it lead him here.

15:46.178 --> 15:50.342
See, I don't know where this guy...
What are we gonna do about this?

15:51.517 --> 15:54.486
Any suggestions?
One.

15:55.854 --> 15:59.085
Since Michael Knight is so
interested in our business...

15:59.158 --> 16:01.991
he might like to sample
our latest product.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.631
I wonder what Cindy
wants to see you about.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.901
I don't know, pal.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.967
All I know is she told Devon
it was important.

16:23.949 --> 16:25.143
Oh, no.

16:29.688 --> 16:31.315
Not Arnold again.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.055
Well, don't say
I didn't warn you.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.568
Think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

16:48.640 --> 16:51.006
I'm a Knight Industries
Two Thousand...

16:51.076 --> 16:55.240
with 1,000 megabits of memory
and a one nanosecond access time.

16:55.614 --> 16:59.015
I bet you wear contact lenses,
too, and eat quiche.

17:00.052 --> 17:04.147
Well, Mr. Brain, if you
won't come out, I'll come in.

17:05.457 --> 17:08.425
Arnold, we really must stop
meeting like this.

17:45.364 --> 17:48.822
What can I get you? Orange
juice. Fresh, if you got any.

17:49.134 --> 17:52.069
Sure you can handle it?
Yeah, I can handle it.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.233
To your good health.
Thank you.

18:28.307 --> 18:31.333
You look real nice. How come
you don't have to wear a uniform?

18:31.410 --> 18:33.401
I'm not the T-shirt type.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.517
You're starting early
this morning.

18:43.589 --> 18:46.524
Yeah. You ought to try some of
this, it's fresh orange juice...

18:46.592 --> 18:51.256
and it's got a lot of vitamin C and
whole bunch other things I can't remember.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.298
Are you okay?
No.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.458
I'm really sorry
about what happened to Lori.

18:57.536 --> 19:01.131
Hey, I know. It wasn't
your fault. Yeah, I know.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.672
Let's have a toast
to some wonderful news.

19:05.744 --> 19:08.645
You got some good news?
I can use some good news.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.909
Yeah, I was invited to
audition for a lead in a show.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.282
No kidding. That's great.
Yeah.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.656
What's going on?
What?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.255
Devon said you wanted to talk
to me about something.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.191
He said it was important.

19:23.262 --> 19:24.559
It wasn't me.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.724
Are you sure? Hey, maybe
it was some other Cindy.

19:28.567 --> 19:32.503
One OJ. Straight up. But I
already got one from the hostess.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.006
Guess this one's
on the house then.

19:38.210 --> 19:43.147
Come on, let's have a toast to
something crazy. I don't know.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.913
Break a leg.
Thanks.

19:56.495 --> 19:59.623
You're telling me you had no idea
Sonny was selling poison chemicals?

19:59.698 --> 20:03.031
What do I look like, a
chemist? I can barely type.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.035
So much for job security.

20:05.103 --> 20:09.335
How long have you worked here,
anyway? Two weeks. Next Friday.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.405
And you have no idea
where Sonny is?

20:11.476 --> 20:13.341
Why do I feel like
I'm being evicted?

20:13.412 --> 20:16.677
Rosemary, a young girl
is dead here. I know that.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.248
But I don't know
where Sonny is.

20:19.851 --> 20:24.288
Did you ever go out with him? For
$5.50 an hour, you gotta be kidding.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.623
Maybe he asked you out.

20:27.426 --> 20:30.088
Twice last week.
Monday and Wednesday.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.755
Maybe he even brought you
some flowers.

20:32.831 --> 20:35.629
I've never known a pretty girl
yet who had to buy her own orchids.

20:35.701 --> 20:38.795
All right, so he brought
me flowers. The creep.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.605
But I still don't know
where he is, that's the truth.

20:42.808 --> 20:46.938
Okay, if you hear from him, anything
at all, you call me at this number.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.207
Even if it's only a postcard.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.109
Now can I go?
Yeah.

20:52.150 --> 20:56.018
Are they going to be surprised to see
me back at the old unemployment line...

20:56.088 --> 20:58.318
and only after nine days, too.

21:07.499 --> 21:09.729
Anything hidden
behind these walls?

21:09.801 --> 21:12.736
Nothing a good exterminator
couldn't take care of, Michael.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.569
Great,
we're back to square one.

21:15.641 --> 21:17.905
There is something
that's puzzling me though.

21:17.976 --> 21:18.965
What?

21:19.044 --> 21:21.512
Rosemary is likely to be
the only young lady...

21:21.580 --> 21:24.879
in the unemployment line
wearing a priceless orchid.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.776
Sonny boy goes first class.
Tell me more, buddy.

21:30.389 --> 21:33.483
It's a Hybrid Jantilius,
an exceptionally rare variety.

21:33.558 --> 21:35.082
In fact,
according to my research...

21:35.160 --> 21:37.151
there's only one
horticulturist in the country...

21:37.229 --> 21:39.129
who has had any success
growing them.

21:39.197 --> 21:42.291
Where can I find him? Right
here in Los Angeles, Michael.

21:42.367 --> 21:46.326
A Mr. Paul Renard. All right,
let's check these orchids out.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.270
What do we have
on Paul Renard?

21:51.643 --> 21:54.669
Except for failure to pay
a traffic citation in '82...

21:54.746 --> 21:56.805
Paul Renard has a clean slate.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.816
And speaking of traffic...

21:58.884 --> 22:02.149
Not another joke.
Remember your stress, Michael.

22:02.354 --> 22:05.289
Yes, it's great to be back
on the road again.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.982
How great is it?

22:07.092 --> 22:10.892
But seriously, I stopped for gas the
other day and the service was so slow...

22:10.962 --> 22:14.762
by the time they filled me up,
my upholstery was out of style.

22:16.601 --> 22:20.594
It's going to be a long,
long ride, KITT.

22:45.330 --> 22:46.456
You all right?

22:46.531 --> 22:49.989
Yeah, I guess I'm just working
myself a little too hard.

22:50.135 --> 22:52.626
Don't worry,
I'm gonna be all right.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.473
Is something wrong,
Mr. Renard?

23:00.545 --> 23:03.275
No, you surprised me,
that's all.

23:04.783 --> 23:08.150
You say you saw a secretary
wearing one of my prize orchids?

23:08.220 --> 23:10.882
Yes, sir.
As impossible as it seems.

23:10.956 --> 23:13.481
She said it was a gift
from her boss.

23:14.192 --> 23:16.490
She must be a whiz
at shorthand.

23:16.628 --> 23:18.357
Ten words a minute.

23:18.630 --> 23:22.066
What sort of business is her
boss into? Killing people.

23:23.969 --> 23:26.631
Maybe you've heard of him,
his name is Sonny Martin.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.138
No, I don't believe I have.

23:28.206 --> 23:30.834
Well, he's a terrific
admirer of yours.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.643
Your orchids.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.410
The Jantilius
is a rare creature.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.345
Would you care to take
a closer look, Mr. Knight?

23:37.416 --> 23:38.815
I'd love to.

23:39.551 --> 23:42.111
Yes, so delicate,
so lovely.

23:42.888 --> 23:46.051
It's hard to believe
it hides a deep, dark secret.

23:46.124 --> 23:47.591
And what is that?

23:47.659 --> 23:51.789
If I told you it wouldn't be a
secret anymore, would it, Mr. Knight?

23:52.097 --> 23:54.088
Well, what do you think of it?

23:54.166 --> 23:58.330
Well, I've got to admit I've never
seen another flower quite like it.

23:58.403 --> 24:01.372
No, in some ways, you're
fortunate to have seen it at all.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.273
If that's all I can do
for you, Mr. Knight.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.441
If I wanted to buy one of your
rare orchids, where would I go?

24:09.514 --> 24:11.482
Unfortunately,
they're not for sale.

24:11.550 --> 24:14.542
No kidding, I wonder
how Sonny Martin got his?

24:15.053 --> 24:17.214
Well, as you can see there
are no armed guards around.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.224
One doesn't expect treachery
in a greenhouse.

24:20.325 --> 24:21.917
Nor in a beachfront bar.

24:21.993 --> 24:24.359
Especially when it involves
the death of a young girl.

24:24.429 --> 24:27.262
I mean, that's treachery
of the worst kind.

24:31.002 --> 24:34.768
I got a sneaky suspicion
we'll meet again. Perhaps.

24:35.707 --> 24:38.039
But then,
who's to say for sure.

24:57.362 --> 24:59.091
Speak of the devil
and the devil appears.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.563
What's Knight doing here?

25:00.632 --> 25:02.293
A better question,
what's he doing anywhere?

25:02.367 --> 25:04.733
Yeah, I thought you were
going to take care of him.

25:04.803 --> 25:06.862
Something must've gone wrong.

25:06.938 --> 25:08.929
And thanks to your generosity
with my orchids...

25:09.007 --> 25:10.474
he's breathing down my neck.

25:10.542 --> 25:11.975
Welcome to the club.

25:12.043 --> 25:14.534
Don't worry about it. Next
time I'll handle him myself.

25:14.613 --> 25:17.446
How? The old fashioned
way. I'm gonna kill him.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.981
KITT, Renard's into this
up to his geraniums.

25:21.052 --> 25:23.452
But how do we prove it,
Michael?

25:23.522 --> 25:24.989
I don't know.

25:25.056 --> 25:29.390
If I knew that I'd be here to take
Cindy for a slow walk on the beach...

25:29.494 --> 25:33.863
instead of trying to find out if she's
even seeing Sonny and Renard together.

25:33.932 --> 25:36.162
You got that hard copy for me?

25:39.070 --> 25:43.336
Now that's what I call instant
service. Keep your scanners peeled, huh?

26:00.926 --> 26:02.416
Michael, duck!

26:22.647 --> 26:25.081
Pick me up.
I'm on my way, Michael.

27:10.428 --> 27:13.192
All right,
let's get this over with.

27:41.926 --> 27:45.760
All right KITT, let's haul him in,
before he gives garbage a bad name.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.367
Take a good look at him,
Sonny.

27:57.442 --> 27:58.932
Look at him!
All right, I looked.

27:59.010 --> 28:02.104
What now? Now we want to
know all about Mr. Renard.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.909
How long
you've worked for him...

28:03.982 --> 28:06.314
where he buys his chemicals,
who his customers are...

28:06.384 --> 28:10.115
how he's managed to run his ghastly
business with such relative ease.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.053
You know something?
You talk funny.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.784
You know something,
you've got a big mouth.

28:13.858 --> 28:14.882
Easy.
One I'm just itching...

28:14.959 --> 28:16.586
to put on the other side
of your face.

28:16.661 --> 28:19.596
I'm sure that when Mr. Martin realizes
the gravity of his situation...

28:19.664 --> 28:21.655
he will only be too happy
to cooperate.

28:21.733 --> 28:22.825
What's my situation?

28:22.901 --> 28:25.961
For openers, you're facing a murder
charge for killing that little girl.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.504
For openers? Try proving it.

28:27.572 --> 28:31.008
There were a dozen witnesses,
man! I had a tough childhood!

28:31.076 --> 28:33.442
I'll find religion. I'll get
a couple of years, that's it.

28:33.511 --> 28:35.035
Michael!

28:36.614 --> 28:38.206
What I want to know from you,
Mr. Martin...

28:38.283 --> 28:40.148
is why did you tried
to kill Michael?

28:40.218 --> 28:43.676
Who tried to kill him? I was
trying to give him a shave.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.285
Listen to me,
you unconscionable lout.

28:46.357 --> 28:49.451
I'm a man of considerable
patience, but once that patience...

28:49.527 --> 28:51.552
has exhausted itself,
it's replaced by a rage...

28:51.629 --> 28:53.028
the like of which
you have never seen.

28:53.098 --> 28:56.397
Now I'm going to ask you one
more time and one more time only.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.403
Why did you try to
kill Michael? Because...

28:59.471 --> 29:02.463
Because why? Because
the poison didn't work.

29:03.108 --> 29:06.669
What poison? The poison they
put in your orange juice.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.975
Who put it in his orange
juice? I don't know!

29:09.047 --> 29:10.105
I think you do.

29:10.181 --> 29:11.842
Devon, there were two glasses
of orange juice.

29:11.916 --> 29:15.443
If I didn't get the one with
the poison in it, Cindy did.

29:21.025 --> 29:23.926
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Cindy.

29:23.995 --> 29:26.987
But is Cindy looking for you?
You don't understand.

29:27.065 --> 29:31.399
Sure I do. Next you'll be telling me
your eyes met across a crowded bar...

29:31.469 --> 29:32.561
and you can't live
without her.

29:32.637 --> 29:36.539
She may not be able to live without me.
She accidentally drank some poison here.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.768
Oh, no.

29:37.976 --> 29:40.536
She said she didn't feel well
when she left.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.603
Do you know where she went?
She had an audition.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.375
Where?
The bandstand on the beach.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.643
Thanks.

30:04.602 --> 30:06.832
Michael. It's okay, I'm
gonna take care of you.

30:06.905 --> 30:09.066
I think they liked me,
I think they really did.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.836
Liked you? They had to
love you. Come on, babe.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.242
KITT, see if you can determine
what kind of poison it is.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.075
Right away, Michael.

30:27.725 --> 30:29.784
Michael,
I've isolated the poison.

30:29.861 --> 30:32.796
What is it? A sophisticated
derivative compound...

30:32.864 --> 30:36.425
originating in the
orchidaceous Bauhinia veriegata.

30:36.501 --> 30:40.130
In plain English, please.
The rare Jantilius orchid.

30:41.706 --> 30:45.870
So that's what Renard meant when he
said it hides a deep, dark secret.

30:45.944 --> 30:47.468
The secret of death.

30:47.545 --> 30:50.514
Unfortunately, there's
no known antidote for it.

30:50.582 --> 30:53.983
KITT, if the poison comes
from the orchid...

30:54.385 --> 30:57.821
there's also a good chance the
orchid could produce the antidote.

30:57.889 --> 30:58.981
That's right, Michael.

30:59.057 --> 31:02.857
All right, as soon as we get her
to the hospital, it's harvest time.

31:02.927 --> 31:07.489
But I told you, Mr. Renard left a
short time ago in his private jet.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.159
Did he say where he was
going? Not to me, he didn't.

31:10.235 --> 31:13.727
But I did hear Miss Ava
mention something about Mexico.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.866
Where in Mexico,
heaven only knows.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.465
KITT, run a check on every
private jet requesting clearance...

31:18.543 --> 31:20.135
to Mexico in the last hour.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.236
I'm checking now, Michael.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.782
Nothing.
Check radio communications.

31:26.851 --> 31:28.182
Good idea.

31:30.221 --> 31:33.816
A private jet ran a weather check
for an area just across the border.

31:34.225 --> 31:37.683
We're getting closer.
Let's get those orchids!

31:41.132 --> 31:42.963
KITT, he beat us to them.

31:43.034 --> 31:44.626
Michael, what is it?

31:44.702 --> 31:48.798
Every last one of them burned to a
crisp. And useless as an antidote.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.637
Guess old Tetzulla
fell asleep on duty.

31:51.943 --> 31:54.810
Tetzulla?
The Aztec God of Fertility.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.905
Mr. Renard brought it back
from one of his trips...

31:57.982 --> 32:00.416
and hung it there to look
after his rare orchids.

32:00.485 --> 32:03.579
KITT, what do you got
in your banks on Tetzulla?

32:03.755 --> 32:06.155
Besides being the Aztec
God of Fertility, Michael...

32:06.224 --> 32:09.682
he's also the patron God of
the Mexican town of Chalaxa.

32:10.094 --> 32:13.257
There's got to be a landing
strip in Chalaxa, buddy.

32:13.331 --> 32:17.165
Yes, a small one, but certainly
large enough for a private jet.

32:17.502 --> 32:20.994
Michael, if you're thinking what I'm
computing, I'm afraid it's a long shot.

32:21.072 --> 32:23.063
Right now, it's the only shot
we got, pal.

32:23.141 --> 32:24.836
Let's swing on down
Mexico way.

32:27.045 --> 32:29.036
Michael, Devon's calling.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.876
Lay it on me, Devon.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.383
The doctors have her on a
life support system, Michael...

32:33.451 --> 32:35.942
but I'm afraid
it doesn't look good.

32:36.888 --> 32:40.380
Devon, look,
this is all because of me.

32:41.225 --> 32:44.023
They've got to keep her alive
till I get back with the antidote.

32:44.095 --> 32:46.188
Believe me, they're
doing everything they can.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.289
You got to get them
to do more!

32:48.366 --> 32:49.560
Please.

32:50.568 --> 32:52.627
You got to get them
to do more.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.831
I'll stay on top of them,
Michael. I promise.

33:28.306 --> 33:30.934
Michael, you know what I think
you could use right now?

33:31.009 --> 33:33.341
The antidote.
Aside from that.

33:33.544 --> 33:36.240
Don't tell me.
A little stress reliever.

33:36.381 --> 33:38.246
Very well, since you insist.

33:40.918 --> 33:43.751
When I was a kid...
You were never a kid.

33:43.821 --> 33:45.812
Not now, Michael,
I'm on a roll.

33:45.890 --> 33:49.223
Now, when I was a kid, we
were so poor... Michael?

33:50.395 --> 33:52.386
All right, how poor were you?

33:52.463 --> 33:54.988
We couldn't afford cheese
to bait the mousetrap.

33:55.066 --> 33:57.762
Another mouse joke?
Please, no heckling.

33:57.835 --> 34:01.293
Anyway, we had to cut out
a picture of cheese for bait.

34:02.173 --> 34:05.506
So what happened? We
caught a picture of a mouse.

34:06.744 --> 34:08.541
Michael, what is it?
Are you in pain?

34:08.612 --> 34:11.514
No, it's your jokes.
They're killing me.

35:05.369 --> 35:08.167
I trust the compound
is totally effective?

35:08.873 --> 35:11.899
Chalaxa is the perfect
place to milk the orchids...

35:11.976 --> 35:13.967
and mass-produce their venom.

35:14.045 --> 35:17.845
One fluid ounce has the killing
power of 25 gallons of cyanide.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.880
A terrorist's dream.

35:39.904 --> 35:41.496
All right, pal,
you know the plan.

35:41.572 --> 35:45.235
We both know the plan, Michael. Now
let's only hope they fall for it.

35:45.309 --> 35:48.745
Soon as I give you the signal,
pull out all the stops.

36:03.528 --> 36:04.654
All right...

36:06.197 --> 36:09.291
Everybody stay where you are.
We've got the place surrounded.

36:09.367 --> 36:13.667
And by orders of the Mexican and United
States authorities, you're all under arrest.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.464
You're an amazing man,
Mr. Knight.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.475
No, Renard,
just one who keeps his word.

36:18.543 --> 36:20.477
I promised I'd see you again.

36:20.545 --> 36:23.605
No one leaves or comes in
this cantina. No one!

36:25.116 --> 36:27.880
I want the antidote
and I want it right now.

36:27.952 --> 36:30.182
I know you keep it real close.

36:30.721 --> 36:33.246
Like maybe on your chain
right there.

36:34.425 --> 36:35.858
You're right again,
Mr. Knight.

36:35.927 --> 36:38.418
You there. Stop!
No one goes inside.

36:38.496 --> 36:40.157
Do not enter the cantina.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.396
Play Melancholy Baby.

36:43.467 --> 36:44.729
It's a trick!

36:44.802 --> 36:47.635
There's nothing out there
but a black car making noises!

36:47.705 --> 36:48.967
Take him!

37:03.654 --> 37:06.145
Sorry I can't give you
the antidote.

37:06.390 --> 37:10.520
But so you won't be too disappointed,
I'm gonna give you the poison.

37:25.109 --> 37:28.636
And I can assure you that
the concentrated injection...

37:28.713 --> 37:32.547
will work much faster than the
one diluted in the orange juice.

38:01.145 --> 38:04.410
Don't tell me I've died
and gone to that hot place.

38:06.550 --> 38:10.987
Don't rush it. You've so little time
left, why spend it on unpleasantries?

38:17.428 --> 38:18.952
Where's Renard?

38:21.132 --> 38:24.226
Michael Knight,
true to your reputation.

38:25.403 --> 38:28.338
Drawing your last breaths
and still fighting.

38:52.797 --> 38:56.961
Why don't we try and go someplace
where we can find a little privacy?

38:58.736 --> 39:01.933
You don't strike me as
the shy and inhibited type.

39:05.242 --> 39:07.472
There's only one question
I gotta ask you.

39:09.580 --> 39:10.638
Why?

39:11.716 --> 39:12.774
Michael?

39:12.850 --> 39:15.546
Michael, where are you?
Can you hear me?

39:16.654 --> 39:18.144
It's what you do with it.

39:28.299 --> 39:29.391
KITT.

39:34.472 --> 39:36.940
Michael, I'm so glad
to see you. Likewise.

39:37.007 --> 39:39.498
Better get the Federales in
here to clean up this place.

39:39.577 --> 39:42.671
Did you find the antidote?
Yeah, and the poison.

39:42.747 --> 39:45.682
Michael, what do you mean?
Scan my vitals. You'll see.

39:45.750 --> 39:49.242
Oh, no, Michael, they've injected
you with a lethal quantity.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.651
Tell me about it.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.780
Renard still has the antidote,
and I'm guessing...

39:52.857 --> 39:55.155
he's on his way back
to LA right about now.

39:55.226 --> 39:58.491
You're right. They took off 14
minutes ago, headed northwest.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.531
I'm afraid that plane was
loaded with a very nasty cargo.

40:01.599 --> 40:04.898
Just about enough poison
to wipe out an entire city.

40:05.469 --> 40:10.099
Okay, pal, they got a
head start. Head start?

40:10.174 --> 40:13.610
Michael, even at my top speed
they'd beat us there by half an hour.

40:13.677 --> 40:15.668
And they're too far up
to micro-jam.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.613
I know, but see if you can access
the plane's navigation computer...

40:18.682 --> 40:20.013
to the Palomar uplink.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.575
If we can scramble their
compass and airspeed indicator...

40:22.653 --> 40:26.111
we may be able to throw them
off course, cost them some time.

40:26.190 --> 40:29.023
Brilliant, Michael.
I'll take it from here.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.798
Now you just relax.

40:45.776 --> 40:50.270
Lear 634, tango delta,
this is LA Center...

40:50.347 --> 40:54.181
request U-turn right,
heading 043.

40:54.251 --> 40:57.243
Roger, LA Center,
turning right to 043.

40:57.721 --> 41:00.690
Anything wrong up there?
It's okay.

41:00.991 --> 41:02.618
Relax, my friend.

41:03.227 --> 41:05.218
You made a fortune today.

41:06.230 --> 41:07.697
You're right.

41:08.098 --> 41:11.795
And the only man who could take
it away from me is dead now.

41:12.670 --> 41:17.164
Marissa, some champagne,
please. Of course.

41:17.741 --> 41:19.538
It'll do us all some good.

41:26.417 --> 41:29.614
KITT, how much longer do
I have? Don't ask me that.

41:30.521 --> 41:33.319
An hour? Two hours?

41:34.825 --> 41:38.090
Cindy, what about poor Cindy?

41:38.662 --> 41:40.892
I'm surprised
you're still with us, Michael.

41:40.965 --> 41:42.694
You're living
on sheer willpower.

42:00.651 --> 42:02.414
Call Devon.

42:03.087 --> 42:06.989
Have them get Cindy to the
airport in an ambulance.

42:08.425 --> 42:10.450
Tell him to meet us there.

42:10.628 --> 42:14.428
The will to live, Michael, it's
all you've got. Don't give up.

42:14.565 --> 42:15.759
You...

42:17.001 --> 42:21.165
You just keep driving on. I'll take
a little nap here, I wanna rest.

42:21.238 --> 42:22.466
Michael!

42:22.907 --> 42:25.637
A friend of mine
flew to Las Vegas yesterday...

42:25.709 --> 42:28.143
and boy, are his arms tired.

42:28.379 --> 42:31.007
I know a man who made so
much money in Las Vegas...

42:31.081 --> 42:32.776
they're still looking
for his body.

42:43.460 --> 42:47.089
That body of water. I don't
remember it on the flight down.

42:47.698 --> 42:50.758
So, we're on a different
flight path. Calm down.

42:51.468 --> 42:54.198
You're getting too old
for this business.

42:54.605 --> 42:58.097
That's Lake Arrowhead.
We're 100 miles off course.

42:58.676 --> 43:02.112
Turn this jet around. Yes,
sir, Mr. Renard, right away.

43:02.479 --> 43:04.709
Head winds, Renard,
head winds.

43:05.749 --> 43:09.207
Next thing you know,
you'll be seeing ghosts.

43:19.396 --> 43:22.092
But when it comes
to having fun...

43:22.833 --> 43:26.428
take my wife, please,
someone take my wife.

44:29.867 --> 44:32.961
Is that them, KITT?
Did we make it?

44:33.404 --> 44:37.704
We surely did, Michael,
and not a moment to spare.

44:37.908 --> 44:41.071
Let's give them a reception
they'll never forget.

44:48.352 --> 44:49.842
Take off again. Now!

44:49.920 --> 44:51.785
We've got to get
airborne immediately!

44:51.855 --> 44:53.083
Head on.

45:02.132 --> 45:06.000
Michael, they're lifting off
again. Not if we can stop them.

45:06.203 --> 45:08.501
Just try and clip
the wing tank.

45:26.490 --> 45:27.957
Michael,
what are you planning?

45:28.025 --> 45:30.391
You hardly have the strength
to stand up.

45:30.461 --> 45:33.521
It's time for another dose
of willpower, buddy.

45:38.702 --> 45:42.160
Michael, the fire's reaching
the jet's main fuel tanks.

45:42.673 --> 45:45.073
Get away from the plane,
it's gonna blow!

45:55.819 --> 45:59.016
Are they all right? All
vitals are strong, Michael.

46:29.019 --> 46:30.850
Cindy's in the back, Michael.

46:30.921 --> 46:32.548
Devon, I got it.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.889
Cindy!

46:38.829 --> 46:43.391
Michael, we're not gonna
die, are we? No, baby.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.935
We got a date, remember?

47:05.889 --> 47:07.015
Beautiful!

47:07.825 --> 47:11.158
Not much like a fox trot, but it
does have a certain animal vitality.

47:11.228 --> 47:14.459
Animal vitality? You kidding?
There's no doubt about that.

47:14.531 --> 47:16.692
Guess what?
Got some good news.

47:16.767 --> 47:19.065
Cindy is on her way
to Broadway.

47:19.136 --> 47:20.296
You're kidding?

47:20.370 --> 47:23.134
The director called me today and
I got the lead in Dance Mania.

47:23.207 --> 47:26.608
That's terrific! Congratulations!
You're going to be great.

47:26.677 --> 47:28.702
Congratulations! This
calls for a celebration...

47:28.779 --> 47:30.110
and I have just the thing.

47:30.180 --> 47:31.477
Better be a good year.

47:31.548 --> 47:34.415
A good year, it's an excellent
year. 1984. Squeezed this morning.

47:36.186 --> 47:37.847
How about
a little champagne?

47:41.525 --> 47:45.017
Speaking of jokes...
We weren't speaking of jokes.

47:45.095 --> 47:48.223
Did I ever tell you about my
cousin who thought he was an orange?

47:48.298 --> 47:50.766
No, but I got a feeling
you're going to.

47:50.834 --> 47:53.598
Well, we would've put him away
except we needed the juice!

47:54.504 --> 47:57.234
Thank you!
You're a beautiful audience.

47:57.307 --> 48:00.208
All right, congratulations.
Hear, hear.

48:00.277 --> 48:02.711
That's right. Fantastic.
Thank you.
