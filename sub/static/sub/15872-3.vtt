00:00.079 --> 00:01.726
Previously on
<i>The Lying Game...</i>

00:01.751 --> 00:02.951
My twin sister.

00:03.004 --> 00:03.760
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

00:03.785 --> 00:05.902
You-You want me
to take your place?

00:05.927 --> 00:08.632
Two days. Just
hang out, relax.

00:08.657 --> 00:11.062
I'm gonna find our real parents.

00:12.535 --> 00:14.011
I knew it.
You're not Sutton.

00:14.456 --> 00:16.523
Probably you that gave
him the idea to go there.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.492
You told him, didn't you?
Is that right? Answer me!

00:18.526 --> 00:20.260
Hey. Hold it.

00:20.295 --> 00:22.162
ETHAN:
<i>Someone broke into your house.</i>

00:22.197 --> 00:23.430
My house?

00:23.465 --> 00:25.099
Yeah, your room,
and the only thing

00:25.133 --> 00:26.200
that they stole is the laptop.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.102
Everything is on that.

00:28.136 --> 00:30.070
back to here.
The trail that's led me

00:30.105 --> 00:31.538
to find that thing!
You guys need

00:31.573 --> 00:34.208
Why didn't you tell them
about me?

00:34.242 --> 00:36.477
How I'm helping
you in this.

00:36.511 --> 00:38.245
His name's Ethan Whitehorse.

00:38.279 --> 00:40.414
<i>It's like he's her secret</i>
<i>boyfriend or something.</i>

00:40.448 --> 00:42.182
Sutton?

00:42.217 --> 00:45.385
He's just a friend.
So why didn't he use the front door?

00:45.420 --> 00:48.355
As promised, Sutton
Mercer's laptop.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.467
You get everything
you need from that?

01:00.502 --> 01:03.036
It's none of your business. You know
what to do with it, right?

01:03.071 --> 01:04.504
Can't I just toss it
in a pond or something?

01:04.539 --> 01:07.074
I want this thing as far
away from me as possible.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.176
No, you can't just toss it
in a pond or something.

01:09.210 --> 01:10.511
You have to do
what we talked about.

01:10.545 --> 01:13.080
Yeah, but those charges
you said you'd get dropped?

01:13.114 --> 01:15.182
Your office keeps calling,
so it's kind of like...

01:15.216 --> 01:17.017
Just do what I ask you to do.

01:17.051 --> 01:18.152
Then we'll see.

01:18.186 --> 01:20.387
(sighs)

01:22.290 --> 01:24.491
(computer beeping)

01:31.065 --> 01:33.333
(sighs)

01:33.368 --> 01:35.302
Morning, sexy.

01:35.336 --> 01:37.404
Sutton...

01:37.438 --> 01:39.206
Good guess.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.074
Palm trees give it away?

01:41.109 --> 01:43.143
Emma doesn't call me sexy.

01:43.178 --> 01:44.378
Yet.

01:44.412 --> 01:48.315
Look, I know
I owe you an apology.

01:48.349 --> 01:50.250
you were leaving?
For not telling me

01:50.285 --> 01:52.286
your place?
Or that Emma was taking

01:52.320 --> 01:54.488
It all happened so fast,
and I figured

01:54.522 --> 01:57.124
knew. Plus, I knew I was gonna
it would be safer if no one

01:57.158 --> 01:58.125
be back in a few days.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.160
Hey, Dan.

02:00.195 --> 02:02.029
You plan on going
to school today?

02:02.063 --> 02:03.997
Why wouldn't I?

02:04.032 --> 02:06.333
I don't know. You might want
to get your ass out of bed.

02:06.367 --> 02:10.070
at the Mercer house?
How's it going on the break-in

02:10.104 --> 02:12.072
on the stolen laptop?
Is there any word

02:12.106 --> 02:13.273
Why do you care?

02:13.308 --> 02:15.442
Unless you're seeing
Sutton again.

02:15.476 --> 02:17.211
I told you, man, you just got

02:17.245 --> 02:19.012
out of juvie,
and that Sutton girl...

02:19.047 --> 02:20.214
I know.

02:20.248 --> 02:22.449
Sutton's bad news.

02:22.483 --> 02:24.184
You assaulted
DAN:

02:24.219 --> 02:26.153
the D.A. last night
because of her.

02:26.187 --> 02:29.056
I'm not gonna be able to
save your ass every time.

02:29.090 --> 02:32.092
All right, he's gone.

02:32.126 --> 02:33.460
Dan knows about us?

02:33.494 --> 02:37.197
Uh, hello, secret boyfriend.

02:37.232 --> 02:38.398
Who else knows?

02:38.433 --> 02:40.133
Actually, your mom and dad.

02:40.168 --> 02:42.269
and Emma last night.
They walked in on me

02:42.303 --> 02:44.471
What the hell is she doing?

02:44.505 --> 02:48.141
and this is what happens?
I go away for a few days,

02:48.176 --> 02:50.377
This is what you told her to do.
SUTTON: No, no.

02:50.411 --> 02:52.412
I told her to pretend to be me.

02:52.447 --> 02:54.514
keep her head down,
I thought she would

02:54.549 --> 02:57.050
my whole life!
but instead, she's messing up

02:57.085 --> 02:58.352
Oh, I think
she's doing just fine.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.320
All right, it took her a day
to break up with Luke.

03:00.355 --> 03:02.222
How long you been saying
you were going to do that?

03:02.257 --> 03:03.457
That's not the point.

03:03.491 --> 03:07.194
Just make sure
nobody else finds out about us,

03:07.228 --> 03:09.229
and stay away from Emma.

03:09.264 --> 03:11.398
How'd you figure it out?

03:11.432 --> 03:15.068
How'd you know it wasn't me?

03:15.103 --> 03:17.404
I kissed her.

03:17.438 --> 03:20.207
It was the only way

03:20.241 --> 03:21.475
I could know for sure.

03:21.509 --> 03:23.310
about the switch,
All right, if you had told me

03:23.344 --> 03:24.478
to kiss her.
I wouldn't have had

03:24.512 --> 03:26.413
You kissed Emma.

03:26.447 --> 03:32.386
Well, I would appreciate it
if you didn't do that again.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.221
You're my boyfriend,

03:34.255 --> 03:36.156
remember?

03:38.092 --> 03:40.394
I love you, Ethan.

03:44.198 --> 03:46.433
I love you, too, Sutton.

- I don't know. I think

04:17.332 --> 04:19.298
I kept seeing him
for you guys, really.

04:19.334 --> 04:21.368
While you were sneaking
around with...

04:21.402 --> 04:23.303
Ethan. Yes.

04:23.338 --> 04:25.172
Why don't we have him over

04:25.206 --> 04:27.040
for dinner?
The guy who clocked your godfather?

04:27.075 --> 04:29.176
Alec's actually
the one who hit him.

04:29.210 --> 04:33.046
I just want you to understand
that he's not some creep

04:33.081 --> 04:35.015
who snuck into my bedroom.

04:35.049 --> 04:36.283
He's... Look, I promise--

04:36.317 --> 04:39.319
if you get to know him, you're
going to see how great he is,

04:39.354 --> 04:40.988
like I do.

04:43.391 --> 04:47.060
(playing classical music)

04:59.340 --> 05:01.174
(clapping)

05:02.343 --> 05:03.977
That was amazing.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.145
Thanks.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.114
But you're gate-crashing.

05:07.148 --> 05:09.216
I thought I was alone.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.218
I'll buy a ticket.

05:11.252 --> 05:12.352
How much
do I owe you?

05:12.387 --> 05:14.321
Uh, depends.

05:14.355 --> 05:17.290
The Get Up Kids played this park
last spring, and that was free.

05:17.325 --> 05:19.126
Sounds like a great night.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.228
I saw them at Coachella.

05:21.262 --> 05:24.031
Slept in my car to pay
for the three-day pass.

05:24.065 --> 05:26.066
I would do it again
in a heartbeat.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.401
So what are you
doing out here

05:27.435 --> 05:29.302
wasting music on
the birds and bees?

05:29.337 --> 05:31.371
For now, you know.

05:31.406 --> 05:33.407
But one day I'll have
this place packed.

05:33.441 --> 05:35.108
Get Up Kids packed.

05:35.143 --> 05:37.244
And I will be
looking forward to it.

05:37.278 --> 05:38.345
I'm Justin.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.147
Laurel.

05:40.181 --> 05:41.948
First girl I met in Phoenix.

05:41.983 --> 05:43.083
Lucky me.

05:44.118 --> 05:45.452
See you around.

05:53.327 --> 05:55.062
Kind of heroic that
creepy, weird guy

05:55.096 --> 05:56.329
got in my
dad's face for you.

05:56.364 --> 05:58.165
Speak of the devil.
Hello, girls.

05:58.199 --> 06:02.035
Mind if I steal my daughter
for a second?

06:02.070 --> 06:04.304
Alec, I just want
to apologize

06:04.338 --> 06:06.273
for butting in last night.

06:06.307 --> 06:09.076
Things got kind
of out of control.

06:09.110 --> 06:11.912
Oh, listen, apology accepted.

06:11.946 --> 06:15.115
Will you excuse us for a minute?

06:16.184 --> 06:18.218
Like it was Sutton's fault.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.353
You embarrassed me
in front of all my friends.

06:20.388 --> 06:22.956
Kind of like
you're doing right now.

06:22.990 --> 06:25.092
Mads, I could have handled
last night a little better.

06:25.126 --> 06:27.027
But that's no excuse.

06:27.061 --> 06:28.895
You cannot just not come home.

06:28.930 --> 06:29.996
You need to call, okay?

06:30.031 --> 06:31.198
We still have ground rules.

06:31.232 --> 06:33.200
What, like the rules
you had with Thayer?

06:33.234 --> 06:35.969
I'm trying to be
the best father I can.

06:36.003 --> 06:37.938
I love my children, Mads.

06:37.972 --> 06:40.006
We're all we have left.

06:41.342 --> 06:44.377
Uh, can you give me a sec?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.081
Ew. No, really?

06:48.116 --> 06:51.017
I should at least
say thank you.

06:51.052 --> 06:54.154
Alec was strong-arming me,
till Ethan came along.

06:54.188 --> 06:56.056
Well, don't let him
breathe on you.

06:56.090 --> 06:57.157
And watch the spittle.

06:57.191 --> 06:59.059
STPs-- so serious.

06:59.093 --> 07:00.293
We're learning all
about them in Bio.

07:00.328 --> 07:03.096
Thank you for the head's up.
Mm-hmm.

07:04.232 --> 07:06.333
What are you doing?

07:06.367 --> 07:10.237
Allegedly thanking you
for defending me from Alec.

07:10.271 --> 07:13.173
Actually, letting you
know the good news.

07:13.207 --> 07:14.975
I sorted things out
with the parents.

07:15.009 --> 07:16.309
Told them that you
were my boyfriend.

07:16.344 --> 07:17.911
Well, Sutton's.

07:17.945 --> 07:19.279
What?!

07:19.313 --> 07:21.047
Why would you do that?

07:21.082 --> 07:22.349
It's a good thing,
isn't it?

07:22.383 --> 07:25.352
The Alcove, five minutes.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.057
THAYER:
<i>You and Emma are twins.</i>

07:31.092 --> 07:32.959
It'd be weird if he wasn't
attracted to her, Sutton.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.995
'Cause our relationship
is purely physical?

07:35.029 --> 07:36.229
Oh, come on. If
you weren't worried,

07:36.264 --> 07:38.165
then why did you
tell him you love him?

07:38.199 --> 07:41.001
What kind of person do you think I am?
A smart one.

07:41.035 --> 07:43.069
With a trunkful
of ulterior motives.

07:43.104 --> 07:44.237
What Ethan and I had

07:44.272 --> 07:46.039
is beyond physical.

07:46.073 --> 07:47.941
He's very romantic.

07:47.975 --> 07:49.376
Even the way we met.
(groans)

07:49.410 --> 07:51.344
Okay, forget it.
No, no, no, please,

07:51.379 --> 07:54.214
regale me with instances
of his awesomeness.

07:54.248 --> 07:57.217
Thayer, just tell
me what you got.

07:57.251 --> 07:59.085
Okay, your birth mother...
Ruth Peterson-- this I know.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.087
Name on both our
birth certificates.

08:01.122 --> 08:03.957
Bailed on me in Santa Monica.
She just shut down her profile page.

08:03.991 --> 08:05.892
Now that's how we contacted
her before,

08:05.927 --> 08:08.228
so my guess is Ruth stood you up
for a reason.

08:08.262 --> 08:10.864
Why? What would make
her change her mind?

08:10.898 --> 08:12.199
Maybe she just freaked
at the thought

08:12.233 --> 08:13.967
of meeting her daughter.

08:14.001 --> 08:15.235
You can be kind of overwhelming.

08:16.304 --> 08:18.171
Luckily, I'm a genius.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.307
Her friends list was cached
on the search engine,

08:20.341 --> 08:22.142
so I was able to
cross-reference.

08:22.176 --> 08:24.244
Seven of her friends
work at the same place.

08:24.278 --> 08:25.912
I'm betting Ruth works
there, too.

08:25.947 --> 08:27.013
Where is it?

08:27.048 --> 08:29.249
Rodeo Drive?
Movie studio?

08:29.283 --> 08:31.952
Even better. A library.

08:33.988 --> 08:36.121
What do you mean you told them
I was your boyfriend?

08:36.157 --> 08:39.292
They walked in on you at 11:00
at night in my bedroom.

08:39.327 --> 08:41.328
Yeah, and we told them
that we're just friends!

08:41.361 --> 08:43.230
Which is lame.
They weren't buying it.

08:43.264 --> 08:45.899
So I had to just tell them the truth.
The truth?

08:45.933 --> 08:48.001
The truth is,
they're not your parents.

08:48.035 --> 08:51.071
You're someone else pretending
to be their daughter.

08:51.105 --> 08:52.339
Which, P.S., they believe.

08:52.373 --> 08:54.174
So obviously I'm doing
a pretty good job.

08:54.208 --> 08:56.209
Why are you pissed at me?

08:56.244 --> 08:59.079
This is a good thing
for you and Sutton.

08:59.113 --> 09:01.982
They want to get to know you,
they want to have you over for dinner.

09:02.016 --> 09:03.149
Dinner?

09:03.184 --> 09:06.286
Yes. Kristin-- she is
a great cook.

09:08.122 --> 09:11.057
Okay, fine. I'm really sorry.
I got carried away.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.260
I just thought that Sutton would
want them to know--

09:13.294 --> 09:15.061
at least if you guys
got caught--

09:15.096 --> 09:16.896
that you weren't some criminal.

09:18.199 --> 09:21.835
Well, that's not
what Sutton wants, okay?

09:21.869 --> 09:24.304
What about what you want?

09:28.009 --> 09:30.844
Just get Laurel to keep quiet
about this stuff, okay?

09:30.878 --> 09:33.079
Sutton's friends
can't know about us.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.948
And you got to make
this dinner go away.

09:34.982 --> 09:37.183
It's what Sutton would do,
and this is her life

09:37.218 --> 09:39.152
you're messing with.

09:45.977 --> 09:48.770
So he's not your
secret boyfriend?

09:49.468 --> 09:51.436
No. I...

09:51.470 --> 09:54.205
Ethan freaked when
Mom and Dad found out.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.507
He doesn't want
anyone else to know.

09:55.541 --> 09:59.244
So you have to keep
it on the D.L.

09:59.278 --> 10:01.580
Oh. I guess I could,

10:01.614 --> 10:05.383
but how will I remember
not to tell anyone?

10:05.418 --> 10:07.519
You want something.

10:07.553 --> 10:10.221
Uh, duh. That's how this
relationship works.

10:10.256 --> 10:12.424
You do something bad,
I find out about it

10:12.458 --> 10:16.394
and then blackmail you in exchange
for my complete and utter silence.

10:16.429 --> 10:18.563
Oh, well, what do you want?

10:18.598 --> 10:20.298
There's a guy.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.400
I met him this morning
in Cactus Park.

10:22.435 --> 10:25.303
All I know is his name's Justin,
he's new in Phoenix

10:25.338 --> 10:27.472
and judging from his T-shirt,
he might be in the Marines.

10:27.506 --> 10:30.308
In Phoenix?
Or he was

10:30.343 --> 10:31.409
in the Marines.

10:31.444 --> 10:33.244
Or he loves the Marines.

10:33.279 --> 10:35.146
Okay, yeah, this isn't
a lot to go on.

10:35.181 --> 10:38.283
Okay, tall, blonde, surfer-cute,
kind of...

10:38.317 --> 10:40.285
Runner-preppy?

10:46.492 --> 10:48.293
Hi, new guy.

10:48.327 --> 10:50.228
JUSTIN:
Hey.

10:50.262 --> 10:52.163
Welcome to Arroyo.

10:52.198 --> 10:54.432
Thank you.
Thrilled to be here.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.234
A week late-- missed
so much already.

10:56.268 --> 10:59.170
Don't worry, we'll fill you in.
We kind of run the place.

10:59.205 --> 11:00.405
Then I guess you're
the girls to know.

11:00.439 --> 11:02.474
And I guess you
are a fast learner.

11:02.508 --> 11:04.476
Here's hoping.

11:04.510 --> 11:06.277
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.

11:08.147 --> 11:10.315
Okay, so I know we both saw
him at the same time,

11:10.349 --> 11:12.150
but he's perfect for me,
don't you think?

11:12.184 --> 11:13.485
So Ken to my Barbie.

11:13.519 --> 11:15.320
At first glance, sure.

11:15.354 --> 11:17.489
What, you want him for yourself?

11:17.523 --> 11:20.125
No, trust me. I just...
Come on.

11:20.159 --> 11:21.559
I just got kicked out
of dance recital,

11:21.594 --> 11:24.229
my mom is back to drinking
herself into a stupor.

11:24.263 --> 11:26.231
I need something fun
to focus on.

11:26.265 --> 11:28.466
Okay, the "new guy" it is.

11:28.501 --> 11:31.336
Right?
Must find out everything!

11:31.370 --> 11:33.371
Everything.

11:33.406 --> 11:35.273
Did you see the
super-hot new guy?

11:35.307 --> 11:36.441
Sure did.

11:36.475 --> 11:38.576
Let everyone know
he is so mine.

11:50.189 --> 11:51.556
SUTTON:
There she is.

12:09.542 --> 12:13.611
Are you Ruth Peterson?

12:16.382 --> 12:18.183
How did you find me?

12:18.217 --> 12:21.319
Oh, my God...

12:21.353 --> 12:23.288
I can see it. Our eyes

12:23.322 --> 12:24.522
are kind of
the same, right?

12:24.557 --> 12:26.191
You know, we can't talk here.

12:26.225 --> 12:27.425
Why don't I get
my purse

12:27.460 --> 12:29.461
and, um, we'll take a walk?

12:29.495 --> 12:31.196
Yeah, okay. Great.

12:31.230 --> 12:32.430
We'll take a walk.

12:33.566 --> 12:35.300
This is incredible.

12:35.334 --> 12:36.468
No, something's not right.

12:36.502 --> 12:37.469
She's bolting.

12:39.438 --> 12:40.538
Please stop, Ruth!

12:40.573 --> 12:42.173
Mom!

12:45.511 --> 12:49.214
I can't give you what you want.

12:49.248 --> 12:51.316
I don't want anything.

12:51.350 --> 12:54.319
I just had to see you

12:54.353 --> 12:57.355
and just know the truth
about you.

12:57.389 --> 13:00.258
And I want you to know
that your twins, we're okay,

13:00.292 --> 13:01.459
and we found each other...

13:01.494 --> 13:04.462
No, don't. I...

13:04.497 --> 13:06.498
I'm sorry.

13:06.532 --> 13:10.135
The real truth is,
I am not your mother.

13:12.138 --> 13:15.206
I'm not anyone's mother.

13:15.241 --> 13:16.374
If you're not my mother,

13:16.408 --> 13:18.476
then why was your name on
my birth certificate?

13:18.511 --> 13:21.446
Because I was paid a lot
of money to put it there.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.480
By whom?

13:22.515 --> 13:24.382
A baby broker.

13:24.416 --> 13:27.218
He told me your real birth
mother was in bad shape,

13:27.253 --> 13:28.486
wanted to keep
her identity a secret.

13:28.521 --> 13:31.189
Said I'd be doing
her a big favor.

13:31.223 --> 13:32.590
And I'm not proud
of it, but...

13:32.625 --> 13:36.227
at the time,
I really needed the money.

13:36.262 --> 13:40.331
I mean... do you at least know
my real mother's name?

13:40.366 --> 13:42.133
No, I-I never met her.

13:42.168 --> 13:43.501
I don't know
the broker's name either.

13:43.536 --> 13:46.137
He paid me in cash.
It was all so...

13:46.172 --> 13:48.206
secretive.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.475
All that mattered to me was
that the babies

13:50.509 --> 13:52.210
each ended up in
a happier place.

13:52.244 --> 13:54.412
Well, not so happy.

13:54.446 --> 13:57.582
My sister Emma ended
up in foster care.

13:57.616 --> 14:02.220
No, no, you were both adopted.
I signed those papers.

14:02.254 --> 14:04.422
You went to the Mercers
in Phoenix,

14:04.456 --> 14:07.125
and the other twin went to the
Websters in Beverly Hills.

14:07.159 --> 14:08.493
Okay, this doesn't
make sense.

14:08.527 --> 14:12.497
If Emma was adopted by a rich
family in Beverly Hills,

14:12.531 --> 14:16.167
then how did she end up in the
foster system in Nevada?

14:16.202 --> 14:18.336
LAUREL:
<i>It's too late.</i>

14:18.370 --> 14:19.504
Char already called dibs.

14:19.538 --> 14:21.306
What are we, 12?

14:21.340 --> 14:24.342
Dibs is the code,
and you invented it.

14:24.376 --> 14:27.445
When I was 12, right?

14:27.479 --> 14:30.281
Okay, so now it's perfectly fine
for me

14:30.316 --> 14:32.350
to go after the guy
your best friend likes?

14:32.384 --> 14:34.252
I don't know.

14:34.286 --> 14:36.454
I mean, well, you saw him
first, right?

14:36.488 --> 14:38.556
I understand you want to
be a good friend,

14:38.591 --> 14:40.491
but maybe if you just talk
to Char.

14:40.526 --> 14:42.493
'Cause we're BFF's.

14:42.528 --> 14:45.463
I haven't gotten my official
invitation to the wolf pack,

14:45.497 --> 14:49.467
and if I go after her new crush,
I probably never will.

14:49.501 --> 14:52.203
I've seen what you guys do to
kids you don't like.

14:52.238 --> 14:54.339
Char would have no problem

14:54.373 --> 14:56.574
making my life miserable, and
you'd probably help her do it.

14:56.609 --> 14:58.610
Laurel, I would never.

15:00.346 --> 15:02.146
You're my sister.

15:02.181 --> 15:04.482
(chuckles) Okay.
Very reassuring.

15:04.516 --> 15:07.185
You know what? Forget it.

15:12.524 --> 15:15.293
Hey, stranger.

15:15.327 --> 15:17.495
Hi, Justin.

15:17.529 --> 15:19.330
Welcome to Arroyo.

15:22.201 --> 15:25.136
Um, lucky us, right?
I mean, twice in one day.

15:25.170 --> 15:28.139
Yeah, it's just a teeny tiny
little world.

15:28.173 --> 15:30.241
I gotta get to Chem.

15:30.276 --> 15:32.210
Before you do...

15:32.244 --> 15:34.145
How did you learn how
to do that?

15:34.179 --> 15:36.381
Dad was in the mob.

15:37.416 --> 15:39.250
I'm kidding.

15:39.285 --> 15:41.252
But this...

15:41.287 --> 15:43.254
really is my number...

15:43.289 --> 15:46.291
in case there are any, uh, private
concerts I should know about.

15:47.526 --> 15:50.194
(chuckles) I'll see ya.

15:53.565 --> 15:57.201
Mom?

15:57.236 --> 15:58.503
BOTH:
I need to talk to you.

15:58.537 --> 16:01.339
Okay, me first.

16:01.373 --> 16:02.473
I feel awful.

16:02.508 --> 16:05.076
You feel awful?

16:05.110 --> 16:07.512
I thought I was the one who got
caught with a boy in her room.

16:07.546 --> 16:10.481
Yes, and that is
not okay, but...

16:10.516 --> 16:12.417
What?

16:12.451 --> 16:15.486
I can't believe you felt
the need to sneak around

16:15.521 --> 16:18.289
and hide your true boyfriend,

16:18.324 --> 16:21.426
keep seeing Luke
just to make us happy?

16:21.460 --> 16:23.328
It's not how I want your
relationship with me

16:23.362 --> 16:24.462
or your dad to be.

16:24.496 --> 16:28.132
I want to be honest with you,
more than you know.

16:28.167 --> 16:31.069
Please don't think just
because Luke is familiar

16:31.103 --> 16:33.137
we wouldn't be open
to someone from

16:33.172 --> 16:36.240
somewhat different
circumstances.

16:36.275 --> 16:40.078
Thank you. That means a lot.

16:40.112 --> 16:42.313
So, thank you
for suggesting dinner.

16:42.348 --> 16:44.115
I think it's a great idea.

16:44.149 --> 16:47.251
We're looking forward to meeting
Ethan properly.

16:47.286 --> 16:48.353
(sighs)

16:48.387 --> 16:50.088
Actually,

16:50.122 --> 16:53.291
I was going to
suggest that we cancel dinner.

16:53.325 --> 16:56.094
I have this paper due
for Mr. Beattie...

16:56.128 --> 16:57.428
You mean Mr. Beastly,

16:57.463 --> 16:59.297
the teacher you've been
dreading for years?

16:59.331 --> 17:01.966
Not that I'm complaining,
but since when

17:02.001 --> 17:04.068
do you care
about a paper being due?

17:04.103 --> 17:06.371
Well, I-I don't.

17:06.405 --> 17:09.040
It's just...

17:09.074 --> 17:10.308
I think you're looking
for an excuse,

17:10.342 --> 17:12.143
and I don't want
you to find one.

17:12.176 --> 17:14.145
I want to have
this dinner.

17:14.179 --> 17:16.381
And I'm making tamales,
your favorite.

17:16.415 --> 17:20.451
Well, I guess dinner it is then.

17:20.486 --> 17:22.987
(quietly):
I'll tell Ethan.

17:23.021 --> 17:24.321
I thought you were gonna take
care of this.

17:24.356 --> 17:25.990
I couldn't.

17:26.025 --> 17:27.224
Sutton could have.

17:27.259 --> 17:28.425
Well, I'm not Sutton!

17:28.460 --> 17:31.029
Keeping you a secret,
seeing Luke,

17:31.063 --> 17:33.197
Kristin thinks that this is
their fault,

17:33.232 --> 17:35.233
and I have no idea
if that's true.

17:35.267 --> 17:37.468
It is breaking my heart,
and it'll break her heart

17:37.503 --> 17:39.303
if you don't come.

17:39.338 --> 17:40.405
You really care about
these people

17:40.439 --> 17:42.140
who aren't even your real
parents?

17:42.174 --> 17:45.043
They're the closest thing
that I have ever had.

17:45.077 --> 17:47.178
I know I have

17:47.212 --> 17:48.446
been making a mess,

17:48.480 --> 17:51.449
but I'm just trying
to make it better.

17:51.483 --> 17:55.186
Well, I guess I should help.

17:55.220 --> 17:57.488
Really?
Yeah.

17:57.523 --> 17:59.157
Thank you.

17:59.191 --> 18:00.291
Sorry.

18:00.325 --> 18:02.026
That's all right.

18:02.061 --> 18:03.961
I will see you tonight.

18:03.996 --> 18:05.129
(murmurs)

18:12.834 --> 18:14.834
5...6...7...8

18:15.313 --> 18:17.381
(classical music playing)

18:27.916 --> 18:29.069
Do you want
to get going?

18:29.094 --> 18:30.094
Un-um. No.

18:30.145 --> 18:31.212
Hey, there.

18:31.927 --> 18:32.691
By any chance could I

18:32.692 --> 18:34.426
get you to wait in the car?

18:34.460 --> 18:36.595
What, for these prices?
Don't you think I should have

18:36.629 --> 18:38.831
a front-row seat
and a bucket of popcorn?

18:38.865 --> 18:41.700
Sometimes the girls get a little
nervous when they're not ready.

18:41.734 --> 18:44.670
I just want it to be perfect for when
the parents see it at the recital.

18:44.704 --> 18:46.705
Is that what it is?

18:46.739 --> 18:48.473
(phone rings)

18:48.508 --> 18:51.610
I'll be right back.

18:51.644 --> 18:55.881
Hello. Well, tell the judge
the D.A.'s office doesn't agree.

18:55.915 --> 18:57.883
Thank you.

18:57.917 --> 18:59.618
Do you want to talk about it?

18:59.652 --> 19:02.554
No. I just want to dance.

19:14.467 --> 19:15.834
My parents are liars.

19:15.869 --> 19:17.836
birth mother was dead.
They said our real

19:17.871 --> 19:19.471
Maybe she is.

19:19.505 --> 19:23.675
was dead.
They said Ruth Peterson

19:23.710 --> 19:25.777
our real birth mother,
She may not be

19:25.812 --> 19:27.446
but she's certainly alive.

19:27.480 --> 19:28.780
Okay, but what about
that baby broker?

19:28.815 --> 19:30.616
They could have told
your parents anything.

19:30.650 --> 19:33.819
And if our adoption was as shady
as Ruth made it sound...

19:33.853 --> 19:35.787
Yeah, shady and illegal.

19:35.822 --> 19:38.624
certificates? It's crazy, Emma.
Fake names on fake birth

19:38.658 --> 19:42.728
I can't believe
Ted and Kristin knew about that.

19:42.762 --> 19:44.496
Why not?

19:44.530 --> 19:46.498
the Mercer family Kool-Aid?
You've been drinking

19:46.532 --> 19:49.534
It's just... I mean,
they've been really nice.

19:49.569 --> 19:52.638
Maybe they think they're
protecting you.

19:52.672 --> 19:55.641
thing in the world
Emma, it is the most natural

19:55.675 --> 19:58.410
to find her real birth parents.
for an adopted kid to want

19:58.444 --> 20:00.412
standing in the way of that?
Why are they

20:00.446 --> 20:01.546
It's got to be something big.

20:01.581 --> 20:04.783
Okay, it's just...

20:04.817 --> 20:06.852
what they did then doesn't
matter as much

20:06.886 --> 20:08.487
as who they are now.

20:08.521 --> 20:09.655
Maybe not to you,

20:09.689 --> 20:11.924
whole hell of a lot to me.
but it matters a

20:14.560 --> 20:16.428
KRISTIN:
<i>I hope you like tamales.</i>

20:16.462 --> 20:18.497
I don't know if
you're a vegetarian or...

20:18.531 --> 20:19.731
No, no, this is great.

20:19.766 --> 20:20.832
I eat anything.

20:20.867 --> 20:22.734
(cell phone buzzes)

20:22.769 --> 20:25.771
So, Ethan, I gotta ask,
how was prison?

20:25.805 --> 20:26.905
Lauren...

20:29.909 --> 20:31.643
No, it's-it's okay.

20:31.678 --> 20:34.713
Actually, it was juvie,
and it wasn't fun.

20:34.747 --> 20:36.481
Why don't we start
with something

20:36.516 --> 20:37.749
a little more basic, honey?

20:37.784 --> 20:40.585
We know your brother, we know
you work at the club. Is that

20:40.620 --> 20:41.687
how you and Sutton met?

20:41.721 --> 20:43.655
Yeah.
No.

20:43.690 --> 20:46.692
Well, you valet
at the club.

20:46.726 --> 20:49.661
And we go to school
together, so...

20:49.696 --> 20:51.563
Why don't you tell
the story?

20:51.597 --> 20:55.767
Well, yeah, we had seen each
other at school

20:55.802 --> 20:56.868
and at the club before.

20:56.903 --> 20:59.504
Probably more like
I'd seen her,

20:59.539 --> 21:02.441
but then there was
that flat tire.

21:02.475 --> 21:04.743
Oh, right, right!

21:04.777 --> 21:06.778
Yeah, I'd seen her on the side
of the road.

21:06.813 --> 21:09.548
So I helped her change it.

21:09.582 --> 21:11.450
And that was it.

21:11.484 --> 21:14.519
KRISTIN:
So nice.

21:14.554 --> 21:16.455
Honey, you know
we have Triple A.

21:16.489 --> 21:18.557
Thank you for coming
to Sutton's rescue.

21:18.591 --> 21:20.826
'Cause she just screams
"damsel in distress."

21:20.860 --> 21:23.462
I don't buy it.

21:23.496 --> 21:25.731
There's no way you'd let some
strange guy-- sorry, but a guy

21:25.765 --> 21:27.632
everyone in this town
talks about--

21:27.667 --> 21:29.768
pull up and take over.

21:31.504 --> 21:32.838
You're right.

21:32.872 --> 21:38.543
I actually insisted on
changing my own tire, right?

21:38.578 --> 21:40.746
Well, I was trying to spare your
parents the part

21:40.780 --> 21:42.781
where you almost destroyed

21:42.815 --> 21:45.684
a $200 rim because you were
too stubborn to admit

21:45.718 --> 21:47.753
you had no idea
what you were doing.

21:47.787 --> 21:49.488
It's all starting
to fit together now.

21:49.522 --> 21:52.791
After that, we took a little ride on
my motorcycle.

21:52.825 --> 21:54.459
Whoa. What?

21:54.494 --> 21:56.828
I wore a helmet. Right?

21:56.863 --> 21:58.563
Yeah. Yeah, I want

21:58.598 --> 22:00.699
to take her up to the overlook
off Route 18.

22:00.733 --> 22:02.768
There was this rising moon
that night.

22:02.802 --> 22:04.703
It was pretty incredible.

22:04.737 --> 22:07.472
I remember this.
You came home one night,

22:07.507 --> 22:08.774
raving about the moon.

22:08.808 --> 22:11.410
Saying how it had
always been there,

22:11.444 --> 22:12.677
but you'd never seen it.

22:12.712 --> 22:14.379
(doorbell rings)

22:14.414 --> 22:16.415
I'll get it.

22:16.449 --> 22:18.350
Moon love's a little
mushy for me, anyway.

22:18.384 --> 22:20.585
So what do you ride?

22:20.620 --> 22:23.688
I had a Vespa when I
was an intern back in L.A...

22:25.758 --> 22:28.827
Sorry to interrupt,
Dr. Mercer, Mrs. Mercer.

22:28.861 --> 22:31.363
But I need to get my
brother home right away.

22:31.397 --> 22:32.597
It's a family emergency.

22:32.632 --> 22:33.665
Everything all right?

22:33.699 --> 22:35.767
I'll explain when we get home.

22:37.770 --> 22:41.406
Um... Thanks so much
for dinner. It was great.

22:41.441 --> 22:43.508
Sorry I have to bail.

22:43.543 --> 22:44.743
TED:
Yeah. Thanks for coming.

22:44.777 --> 22:47.679
Nice to meet you.

22:49.782 --> 22:51.550
He's lovely, honey.

22:51.584 --> 22:53.485
Yeah. Lovely?

22:53.519 --> 22:54.853
Motorcycles and moonlight?

22:54.887 --> 22:56.688
That's a dad's worst nightmare.

22:56.722 --> 22:59.424
I'm sorry,
I just... have to...

23:01.828 --> 23:03.595
This couldn't
wait till later?

23:03.629 --> 23:05.697
I'm protecting them. Didn't want
you doing any more damage.

23:05.731 --> 23:07.632
What's going on?

23:07.667 --> 23:10.435
Do you need my help?
Go back inside, Sutton.

23:10.470 --> 23:12.337
I don't want to do this in front of you.
Do what?

23:12.371 --> 23:13.572
Tell me!

23:13.606 --> 23:14.806
Okay.

23:14.841 --> 23:17.809
So I found your laptop.

23:17.844 --> 23:20.512
Inside Ethan's Jeep.
He's the one who stole it.

23:20.546 --> 23:22.347
That's crazy.

23:22.381 --> 23:23.748
And impossible,
because Ethan was with me

23:23.783 --> 23:25.517
the night of the break-in.

23:25.551 --> 23:27.752
Well, maybe he didn't
break into your home.

23:27.787 --> 23:29.754
But someone did. And your
laptop ended up with him.

23:29.789 --> 23:31.590
Or how about someone
planted it on me?

23:31.624 --> 23:33.458
But you didn't give it
back to her, did you?

23:33.493 --> 23:35.460
ETHAN:
I didn't know it was there.

23:35.495 --> 23:37.529
I didn't do this.

23:37.563 --> 23:39.664
DAN: Well, don't worry.
We'll get to the bottom of it.

23:39.699 --> 23:42.467
Ethan won't be
bothering you anymore.

23:42.502 --> 23:43.869
Let's go.

23:51.354 --> 23:53.081
Don't feel bad, kiddo.

23:53.380 --> 23:55.315
Some people are just really
good at deceiving you,

23:55.349 --> 23:56.683
and that kid's
got charm for days.

23:56.717 --> 23:58.718
So you think he did it?

23:58.752 --> 24:01.187
I think until the cops
tell us otherwise,

24:01.222 --> 24:02.288
that's what we have to assume.

24:02.323 --> 24:03.523
I just thought...

24:03.557 --> 24:06.226
that he was the one
person I could trust.

24:06.260 --> 24:08.494
Honey... what about us?

24:10.564 --> 24:12.432
You can always trust
your mom and dad.

24:12.466 --> 24:14.234
Okay?

24:14.268 --> 24:15.635
Hey, look... forget Ethan.

24:15.669 --> 24:17.537
All right? Everything else
has been going great

24:17.571 --> 24:19.205
since we got back from Paris.

24:19.240 --> 24:23.343
Whatever you're doing,
you just... keep doing it.

24:24.678 --> 24:26.446
I think I can do that.

24:28.515 --> 24:30.250
That's why I love you.

24:30.284 --> 24:32.385
I love you, too.

24:32.419 --> 24:34.687
Good night.
Night.

24:36.690 --> 24:39.259
What are you writing?
So intense.

24:39.293 --> 24:41.261
Is that your journal?
EMMA: English paper.

24:41.295 --> 24:42.362
(laughs)

24:42.396 --> 24:44.430
What? I didn't have
time last night.

24:44.465 --> 24:46.432
You're actually trying to
finish and turn it in?

24:46.467 --> 24:47.667
Yeah, or she's
just madly copying

24:47.701 --> 24:49.569
whatever she found
on the Internet.

24:49.603 --> 24:51.537
No, it's a paper for
Mr. Beattie's class...

24:53.274 --> 24:55.508
Whatever you have is
way more important.

24:55.542 --> 24:58.578
Uh, yeah. We have to figure out
the perfect "Get Justin" plan.

24:58.612 --> 25:00.647
I'm thinking pool party.

25:00.681 --> 25:02.649
Lure him to the house,
go in for the kill.

25:02.683 --> 25:05.318
Plus, boy-hunting in a bikini
means I'm already halfway there.

25:05.352 --> 25:07.654
Char, what do you
know about this guy?

25:07.688 --> 25:10.223
I mean... you really
think he's all that?

25:10.257 --> 25:11.591
You've seen him, right?

25:11.625 --> 25:13.426
Yeah, he's super hot...

25:13.460 --> 25:15.428
Oh, great.
Now you want him.

25:15.462 --> 25:17.230
You know, I thought
it would take you

25:17.264 --> 25:18.431
more than a second
to get over Luke.

25:18.465 --> 25:20.366
Can I have nothing for myself?

25:20.401 --> 25:22.235
No, I-- you absolutely can.

25:22.269 --> 25:24.237
All right? And I know you called dibs.
Forget it.

25:24.271 --> 25:26.339
There's a sale on at Bloomie's,
which usually feels just as

25:26.373 --> 25:28.408
good as having a boyfriend.
Not that I would know, but...

25:28.442 --> 25:31.444
I'll see you later.

25:31.478 --> 25:32.512
MADS:
It's okay.

25:32.546 --> 25:34.514
She's just a little raw.
Clearly.

25:34.548 --> 25:39.552
I just don't want to see her
get sucked in, and then...

25:39.586 --> 25:40.620
get her heart broken...

25:45.392 --> 25:48.194
I don't know.
Guys can be...

25:48.228 --> 25:51.631
You think they're everything,
and then they turn out to be...

25:51.665 --> 25:53.466
nothing.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.668
Except when they're
everything, right?

26:03.610 --> 26:06.312
♪ ♪

26:12.353 --> 26:14.320
Nice digs.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.522
Emma would've liked
growing up here.

26:16.557 --> 26:19.225
(rings doorbell)

26:23.163 --> 26:26.232
Hi. Are you...

26:26.266 --> 26:27.500
Randall Webster?

26:27.534 --> 26:29.335
And, uh, who wants to know?

26:29.370 --> 26:32.405
I think you adopted
my twin sister.

26:34.441 --> 26:36.409
Well, this is the great
tragedy of my life.

26:36.443 --> 26:40.113
We did adopt a baby, brought her
home, everything was perfect.

26:40.147 --> 26:42.348
Till the birth mother showed up,
asking for her child back.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.117
You can do that?

26:44.151 --> 26:45.551
I hired the best
adoption attorney in L.A.,

26:45.586 --> 26:49.322
but the birth mother had
all the right paperwork.

26:49.356 --> 26:52.125
We had no choice but
to hand our baby over.

26:52.159 --> 26:54.293
So that's... my mother
you're talking about.

26:54.328 --> 26:56.396
What was her name?
Who knows?

26:56.430 --> 26:58.331
She said her name
was Ruth Peterson.

26:58.365 --> 27:00.233
Even had a driver's license
proving that it was.

27:00.267 --> 27:03.202
Ruth Peterson.
We just met her.

27:03.237 --> 27:04.537
She says she's not...
And she isn't.

27:04.571 --> 27:06.439
See, all we wanted
to do was follow up,

27:06.473 --> 27:08.207
make sure the baby was okay.

27:08.242 --> 27:09.375
Quickly found out
what you did:

27:09.410 --> 27:11.411
Ruth Peterson was
just paid for her name.

27:11.445 --> 27:14.480
So the real birth mother,
the one who came to your door,

27:14.515 --> 27:17.116
got a fake driver's
license and then...

27:17.151 --> 27:18.351
Disappeared.

27:18.385 --> 27:21.154
With our baby.
Didn't you call the police?

27:21.188 --> 27:22.422
We couldn't.

27:22.456 --> 27:26.192
Truth is, I knew this was
a back-channel adoption.

27:26.226 --> 27:29.529
Did my parents know
this adoption was

27:29.563 --> 27:32.131
back-channel?
They must have.

27:34.334 --> 27:36.402
WOMAN: Honey? Where are you?
I just got home.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.570
I'm going to have to go.

27:37.604 --> 27:39.372
I don't want this
to upset my wife.

27:39.406 --> 27:40.540
Can I give you
my number, address,

27:40.574 --> 27:42.308
in case you think
of anything else?

27:42.342 --> 27:43.309
WEBSTER:
Absolutely. Good luck.

27:43.343 --> 27:44.343
Thank you.

27:46.513 --> 27:49.182
So did you hear?

27:49.216 --> 27:51.250
Cops finally caught the guy
who broke into the house,

27:51.285 --> 27:53.152
stole Sutton's laptop.

27:53.187 --> 27:54.387
No, I didn't hear.

27:54.421 --> 27:56.322
Yeah, it's that valet
you got into it with

27:56.356 --> 27:57.490
the night of the
father-daughter dance.

27:57.524 --> 27:59.392
Ethan Whitehorse.
Uh-huh.

27:59.426 --> 28:02.128
Kid's got a record,
been to juvie...

28:02.162 --> 28:03.529
Well, it looks like
he's going back.

28:03.564 --> 28:07.467
Yeah, well, I know you helped
his brother back in the day...

28:07.501 --> 28:09.335
That was different.

28:09.369 --> 28:11.270
I mean, this is Sutton
we're talking about, Ted.

28:11.305 --> 28:13.573
We've got to do whatever it
takes to protect our families.

28:17.511 --> 28:18.544
(gasps)
Shh... don't.

28:18.579 --> 28:20.446
You can trust me.

28:20.481 --> 28:23.216
You want me to trust you,
don't hide in my room

28:23.250 --> 28:25.351
and scare the hell out
of me when I walk in.

28:25.385 --> 28:27.420
I've been fending off guys
like you my whole life.

28:27.454 --> 28:28.554
What do you want?

28:28.589 --> 28:30.490
To talk.
To figure out a plan.

28:30.524 --> 28:33.192
I think the plan is,
wait for Sutton to get back,

28:33.227 --> 28:35.161
and let her deal
with all of this.

28:35.195 --> 28:36.496
Don't you get it?
Something's going on here.

28:36.530 --> 28:38.531
This isn't just in L.A.,
it's right here in Phoenix.

28:38.565 --> 28:41.234
Yeah, I'm pretending to be
somebody that I'm not,

28:41.268 --> 28:43.369
and I'm making a big old
mess while I'm at it.

28:43.403 --> 28:45.271
All this stuff is connected:

28:45.305 --> 28:47.473
Sutton's search for her
real mother, the break-in,

28:47.508 --> 28:49.408
Dan finding the
laptop in my truck.

28:49.443 --> 28:52.512
I don't know why you would
want to steal Sutton's laptop.

28:52.546 --> 28:55.181
I wouldn't. Sutton said
it herself, all the info

28:55.215 --> 28:56.482
about her search
is on that thing.

28:56.517 --> 28:59.285
Maybe somebody found out, and
they wanted to see how far

28:59.319 --> 29:01.521
she'd gotten, and then they
wanted her to stop trusting me.

29:01.555 --> 29:03.489
No one knows that you
and Sutton are dating.

29:03.524 --> 29:05.191
My brother does.

29:05.225 --> 29:06.526
Okay, he knows, and
he hates it. He hates you.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.427
He's probably thrilled to
have an excuse to break us up.

29:08.462 --> 29:09.428
Sutton.

29:09.463 --> 29:11.397
Break you and Sutton up.

29:11.431 --> 29:13.266
You know what I mean.

29:15.202 --> 29:16.202
Actually, I don't.

29:18.405 --> 29:22.575
And I really don't know you.

29:25.178 --> 29:28.381
Some people are just
really good at deceiving you.

29:32.119 --> 29:34.387
I guess I don't really
know you, either.

41:17.366 --> 41:22.236
Well, everything's still here,
but whoever broke in saw it all.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.371
No one knows I'm in L.A.

41:23.405 --> 41:25.373
Are you sure
this isn't about you?

41:25.407 --> 41:27.108
Your video game apps?

41:27.142 --> 41:29.110
It's so competitive.
You hear all the time

41:29.144 --> 41:31.212
about gamer espionage.
No, Sutton, that's...

41:31.246 --> 41:32.413
that's not what this is.

41:32.447 --> 41:34.315
Okay, then you're
freaking me out.

41:34.349 --> 41:37.385
I can't believe there was another
break-in about another laptop.

41:37.419 --> 41:39.353
Sorry.

41:39.388 --> 41:41.489
No, no, no, no.
That's-That's okay.

41:41.523 --> 41:44.158
I'll just, um...

41:44.193 --> 41:45.459
uh, sleep on the couch.

41:45.494 --> 41:47.395
No, come on. That's...

41:47.429 --> 41:49.363
This doesn't have to be weird.

41:49.398 --> 41:52.400
I mean, we've known each other
since, like, forever.

41:52.434 --> 41:56.237
Yeah, yeah, uh, forever.

Hi...
Mr. Webster.

42:05.414 --> 42:07.481
Here, I wasn't sure
I even still had this.

42:07.516 --> 42:09.450
But, uh, there you go.

42:09.484 --> 42:11.385
What is it?
That woman--

42:11.420 --> 42:14.322
uh, the one who took
our baby-- she sent us that

42:14.356 --> 42:17.391
about a year after,
and it meant a lot to us.

42:17.426 --> 42:20.461
Uh, but I know it's going to mean a lot
more to you, and you should have it.

42:20.495 --> 42:23.397
She's your mother.

42:39.067 --> 42:42.135
Sutton.
Hi. So glad it's you.

42:42.883 --> 42:44.288
Look. So much has happened.

42:44.293 --> 42:45.687
This is a lot harder
than you thought.

42:45.712 --> 42:47.215
I keep screwing it up.

42:47.822 --> 42:49.022
Stop. This doesn't matter.

42:49.047 --> 42:50.247
No. It does.

42:50.369 --> 42:52.708
Trust me.
Answers on the laptop.

42:52.733 --> 42:55.919
Trust me.
This is way more important.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.654
What? What did you find?

43:01.467 --> 43:02.667
This.

43:04.275 --> 43:05.475
That's you Emma.

43:07.238 --> 43:08.690
And that is our mother.
