WEBVTT

00:09.426 --> 00:11.637
She's being called
the next big thing in YA,

00:11.720 --> 00:14.306
the author of the critically acclaimed
time travel series

00:14.389 --> 00:17.851
Back in Time with Becca Baxter.
Please give a warm Lizzie welcome to...

00:17.935 --> 00:20.771
Kit Smithers!

00:24.316 --> 00:28.362
It is so wonderful to have you
on the show, Kit. I'm a big fan.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.573
Oh, it is wonderful to be here, Lizzie.
I'm a fan too.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.951
Let's dive right in.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.995
Tell me, what did you do
before you became an author?

00:37.079 --> 00:39.581
I was a time traveler, of course.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.752
Actually, I was a middle school teacher.

00:43.836 --> 00:47.005
And I would always fantasize about
what it would be like

00:47.089 --> 00:50.759
if I were able to go back in time
to the most amazing moments in history.

00:51.343 --> 00:54.471
Would I let them run their course,
or would I change them?

00:54.555 --> 00:57.307
But enough about my writing.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.727
Can we talk about the delightful letter
you sent me last week?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.355
Beautiful handwriting, by the way.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.942
I'm flattered, Kit.
Thank you, really.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.152
Let's take some questions
from the audience.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.864
-Yes?
-You wrote Kit Smithers a letter?

01:11.947 --> 01:13.198
Did she write back?

01:14.324 --> 01:15.617
Lizzie?

01:15.701 --> 01:16.785
What?

01:17.786 --> 01:19.997
No. Not yet.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.040
Can you imagine if she actually did?

01:22.124 --> 01:25.127
Imagine?
It's all she's talked about this week.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.962
That is so not true.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.591
-Did the mail come yet?
-Not yet.

01:30.674 --> 01:34.261
Now, sweetie, Kit Smithers is probably
very busy promoting her new book,

01:34.344 --> 01:37.181
so don't take it personally
if she doesn't respond.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.932
I won't. I won't.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.101
She'll write back.

01:41.185 --> 01:43.562
And did I forget to mention

01:43.645 --> 01:47.065
that the next stop for her book tour
is right here in Middleton?

01:47.149 --> 01:51.111
I can't wait to read this and impress her
with all my well-thought-out questions.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.406
Maybe we can both read it this week
for book club.

01:55.282 --> 01:58.202
What? I thought you said
your book club was full.

01:58.285 --> 02:01.622
That was before Lewis's mom got
a promotion and moved the family to Spain.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.625
So yes, there's a spot open.
If you still wanna join.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.960
Let me think about that.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.755
Having deep discussions
about characters in stories

02:09.838 --> 02:11.965
with kids who actually read for fun?

02:12.049 --> 02:14.259
-Of course I wanna do it!
-Great.

02:14.343 --> 02:17.763
I just have to run it by Daphne.
She's club president.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.556
Did you hear that?

02:19.640 --> 02:20.807
I think the mail's here.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.935
This day just keeps getting
better and better!

02:29.107 --> 02:30.692
Hi, Dr. Abby.

02:30.776 --> 02:34.154
Thanks for the warm reception, Lizzie.
It's wonderful to see you too.

02:34.238 --> 02:37.199
I should get home.
I'll call you the second I talk to Daphne.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.700
-Bye.
-Bye.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.579
I'm sorry. I was just
expecting something in the mail.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.499
I do have a special delivery.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.466
Hi. Hi!

02:54.550 --> 02:57.636
What's his name?

03:03.642 --> 03:05.477
One of my clients got Jack here

03:05.561 --> 03:08.230
as a companion for her dog,
Murphy, a mastiff.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.650
But it backfired. They didn't get along
from the moment they met.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.610
Mastiffs are huge.

03:13.694 --> 03:17.823
Jack must have been so scared.
Poor little guy.

03:23.078 --> 03:26.081
-I think he wants to explore.
-Yeah.

03:31.670 --> 03:35.424
Boxer puppies can be quite needy.

03:35.507 --> 03:38.385
We'll give him tons of attention.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.304
That's why you two are my faves.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.140
Speaking of attention,

03:43.223 --> 03:46.226
there's a febrile cockatoo
over in Chanbury who needs mine.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.020
-Thanks, again.
-No problem.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.438
-Thank you.
-Of course.

03:50.105 --> 03:54.067
Lizzie, you weren't expecting
a letter today, were you?

03:54.693 --> 03:57.821
Really? Oh, my gosh.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.407
I can't believe
she actually wrote me back.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.451
I can't believe
you still haven't opened it.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.081
Jack, no!

04:08.165 --> 04:09.374
-Jack!
-Jack.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.460
No, Jack, no!

04:11.543 --> 04:14.129
-Drop it, Jack.
-You're scaring him away!

04:14.213 --> 04:16.380
I think he's feeding off
your energy, honey.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.051
Y-Yeah, no, you're right.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.470
Boxers can be
very sensitive and excitable.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.101
Come here, Jack. It's okay, boy.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.811
Come here, bud.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.190
Come on. Bring it here, Jack.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.192
Come on.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.568
It's okay, boy.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.571
Come here.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.784
You got it. Come here.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.410
Good boy, Jack.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.623
That was awesome.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.501
Yeah. Awesome.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.092
Okay, I think we are getting there.

05:03.303 --> 05:08.600
"Dear Lizzie," something, something.
Puppy drool.

05:08.684 --> 05:12.646
S-Something, smudge, "thoughtful."

05:13.313 --> 05:17.651
Something, something. H--

05:18.694 --> 05:20.863
Thanks for trying, guys.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.949
Honey, I know you've been
waiting for this letter for weeks.

05:26.076 --> 05:31.999
"Fans like you are the r-r-reason I..."

05:33.542 --> 05:35.252
I think it says "write."

05:37.004 --> 05:40.340
What? Fans like me
are the reason she writes?

05:40.424 --> 05:42.926
I'm the reason Kit Smithers writes.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.263
Okay, nobody touch this letter.
I need to find a frame.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.226
Here you go, Jack.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.314
And if you need to chew, use this.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.320
How's he doing?

06:02.779 --> 06:05.657
Okay. He's kind of anxious,
so I'm putting him in the crate.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.619
It'll help him get comfortable
in his new environment.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.246
Tucking him in
like we used to do with you.

06:11.330 --> 06:14.082
Except Jack's not asking for
a little more screen time.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.626
Real funny, Dad.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.253
-I thought it was.
-Thank you, sweetie.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.214
-We're proud of you.
-Yeah.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.595
You really like that dolphin, don't you?

06:31.350 --> 06:34.102
Oh, my gosh. Handwritten and everything.

06:34.186 --> 06:37.189
-She really took the time.
-Yeah.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.317
I think this is the beginning of
a beautiful friendship.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.777
Or at least a pen pal.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.154
I need to write to that letter
to Michelle Obama.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.406
I'm serious, Maria.

06:46.490 --> 06:49.910
First, I find out she's doing a reading
at my favorite bookstore,

06:49.993 --> 06:53.372
then she writes me back,
and finally, she loves dogs.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.041
Look, this is her boxer, Kaboodle.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.168
A boxer, like Jack.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.336
I know.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.965
So, in other exciting literary news,

07:03.048 --> 07:05.926
-I spoke to Daphne about book club.
-What did she say?

07:06.510 --> 07:09.054
The admissions committee
has agreed to an interview.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.764
Tomorrow afternoon, your house.

07:10.848 --> 07:13.308
Admissions committee? Seriously?

07:13.892 --> 07:16.478
I know.
But don't worry. You'll be amazing.

07:16.562 --> 07:19.815
Plus, how can a book club say no
to someone who sort of almost knows

07:19.898 --> 07:22.150
a soon-to-be-world-famous author?

07:24.528 --> 07:26.905
I gotta go. Thanks, Maria.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.789
No. You poor puppy.

07:37.082 --> 07:40.586
Hey, it's okay, Jack. We're here.

07:46.175 --> 07:49.261
Can you believe this used to be a dolphin?

07:50.971 --> 07:53.390
Definitely can't tape that back together.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.477
What's going on with him?

07:57.561 --> 08:00.522
He's probably acting out
because he doesn't like to be alone.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.524
Boxers crave companionship.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.494
Come here, Jack.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.455
Come here.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.416
-Hey, bud.
-Good boy. Good boy.

08:22.085 --> 08:25.422
He definitely seems a lot happier now.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.196
Good morning.

08:51.990 --> 08:55.077
Long night? Looked like
Jack was hogging all the blankets.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.913
-We didn't wanna wake you up.
-Nothing wakes her up.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.831
Okay, okay.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.208
We're worried about Jack,

09:01.291 --> 09:03.877
and we wanna help him gain back
his sense of security.

09:03.961 --> 09:07.381
I don't know why that other dog was
so mean to him. He's such a sweetheart.

09:08.507 --> 09:12.386
-What if we find Jack a friend?
-That's actually a really great idea.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.596
Another dog that'll
make him feel accepted.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.098
I'll call Sammy.

09:16.181 --> 09:20.727
He can bring over Rufus and Goldie.
They're the friendliest dogs in the world.

09:20.811 --> 09:23.480
-Jack will love them.
-Sounds like a plan.

09:23.564 --> 09:27.234
And remember, with socialization,
how you introduce Jack

09:27.317 --> 09:29.778
is just as important as
who you introduce him to.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.614
Fine. But why do you keep saying "you"?

09:32.698 --> 09:35.409
Because I have to get ready
for my own introduction.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.004
S'mores. Excellent choice.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.174
Actually they're "Toni S'morrisons."

09:51.216 --> 09:52.301
Because book club.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.762
Wordplay is a shortcut
to any book club president's heart.

09:56.638 --> 10:00.267
Now it's time for the pièce de résistance.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.729
Good call. They're gonna love you.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.107
Sure hope so.
Okay, I'm ready. Let's do this.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.943
You know they're not coming
for another hour, right?

10:10.027 --> 10:13.071
I knew that. Just got carried away.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.366
Well, um, I better put these pear tarts--

10:16.450 --> 10:20.662
I mean "Shakes-pear" tarts...
...back in the fridge.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.415
All right, over here.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.460
Goldie, Rufus!

10:27.044 --> 10:30.380
I had them play tug-of-war for
half an hour to burn off their zoomies.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.050
That's my grandma's word
for excess energy.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.386
-They're gonna love having a new friend.
-Great. I'll get Jack.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.097
Okay. Ready, guys? It's gonna be great.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.975
Come on, Jack. Come on.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.312
Let's go. Come on. Don't be afraid.

10:48.815 --> 10:49.441
Jack.

10:49.525 --> 10:52.152
-Okay, guys.
-It's okay.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.403
Jack, no.

10:56.156 --> 11:00.035
Do you think Jack's intimidated because
Goldie and Rufus are already so close?

11:00.118 --> 11:04.498
I don't know. If he can't get along with
the two friendliest dogs in the world,

11:04.581 --> 11:05.958
something must be wrong.

11:06.041 --> 11:09.294
Yeah.
Wonder what that other dog did to him.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.964
I'm gonna find out.

11:12.047 --> 11:15.592
The first one was my favorite
because Katniss was so selfless.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.010
I thought the same thing.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.973
So many interesting titles.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.933
We are a family of readers.

11:25.227 --> 11:28.188
So, Lizzie,
what's your position on Little Women?

11:28.689 --> 11:29.690
Masterpiece.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.108
To Kill a Mockingbird?

11:31.191 --> 11:34.987
Classic. But Harper Lee's case of
writer's block was very concerning.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.446
-Audiobooks?
-Love 'em,

11:36.530 --> 11:39.867
-but prefer to read in print first.
-Maria was right.

11:39.950 --> 11:42.619
-You are a great fit for our book club.
-Told you.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.371
And these S'morrisons are unreal.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.332
Does that mean I'm in?

11:49.543 --> 11:52.129
Here's the issue:
we only have one slot available,

11:52.212 --> 11:55.716
and we met another candidate this morning.
She's also very qualified.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.467
And she has a huge swimming pool,

11:57.551 --> 12:00.345
which could be a game changer
for our summer series.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.725
It's a big decision
and I'm gonna need to sleep on it.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.727
It was great to meet you, Lizzie.

12:08.187 --> 12:09.605
Wait.

12:09.688 --> 12:13.108
What if I bring a real author
to our meeting on Sunday?

12:13.192 --> 12:15.652
We'd read her books
and talk about it with her.

12:16.445 --> 12:17.988
What author?

12:18.071 --> 12:21.408
Kit Smithers. Lizzie knows Kit Smithers.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.620
-I do.
-I'm not familiar with her work.

12:24.703 --> 12:28.040
Wait.
You-- You actually know Kit Smithers?

12:28.540 --> 12:30.542
I stan Becca Baxter.

12:31.126 --> 12:34.588
Suspenseful storytelling,
empowering female voice. You'd love her.

12:34.671 --> 12:38.467
Yeah.
Actually, here's a letter she wrote me.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.512
I can't read this.

12:42.012 --> 12:47.935
Uh, it's mostly personal stuff and, um,
inside jokes between me and Kit.

12:48.519 --> 12:49.520
Hang on.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.317
I've never met a published author.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.737
Self-published, yes,
but I'm not sure that counts.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.032
Welcome to the book club, Lizzie.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.042
Are you sure Jack's old owner
is gonna be here?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.045
Dr. Abby said she comes to the dog park
every day at 3:00.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.549
And even if she doesn't, maybe Jack will
find some dogs to play with.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.175
-There are tons here.
-Yeah.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.806
-Should we let him off leash?
-Yeah.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.850
Ready to make some friends, Jack?

13:30.727 --> 13:32.187
Come on.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.984
Come on, Jack.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.695
Here we go again.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.239
Come on, Jack. It's okay.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.410
That dog's bigger than I am.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.829
That's a mastiff. I'll bet it's Andrea.

13:49.413 --> 13:50.539
she's punctual.

13:53.417 --> 13:54.042
Jack?

13:56.378 --> 13:58.589
Jack! Hi!

13:59.256 --> 14:02.926
Yeah! Hello. I've missed you.

14:04.011 --> 14:04.887
Hi.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.849
One of you must be Charles Peterson.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.393
That's me. This is my friend, Sammy.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.936
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:13.020 --> 14:17.858
I-- I'm Jack's old owner.
What a coincidence to bump into you here.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.276
Not really.

14:19.359 --> 14:23.238
-We came to talk to you about Jack.
-You did? Why? What's going on?

14:23.322 --> 14:26.533
He's been having
a really hard time adjusting.

14:26.617 --> 14:29.703
We think your dog really traumatized him.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.039
Murphy?

14:32.122 --> 14:35.000
Are you kidding?
She couldn't hurt a fly.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.795
Uh, she's an old lady and a sweetie pie.

14:41.340 --> 14:45.344
The truth is, if anyone was unwelcoming,
it was Jack.

14:45.427 --> 14:49.598
I-- I mean, he was great with my kids
but wanted nothing to do with Murphy.

14:49.681 --> 14:52.392
If she tried to play with him
or came too close,

14:52.476 --> 14:54.269
Jack would always growl.

14:54.353 --> 14:56.730
Just like he did
with Rufus and Goldie.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.565
-Yeah.
-I-- I didn't wanna give him up,

14:58.649 --> 15:01.568
and I wouldn't have, you know,
if it wasn't for Murphy.

15:03.278 --> 15:08.200
I hope you find him a good home.
He is a great puppy.

15:09.785 --> 15:12.829
-Yeah.
-Let's go, Jack.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.626
He really is.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.546
Don't worry, Jack.
I'm not giving up on you.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.968
So let's look at the facts.

15:26.051 --> 15:29.513
In the past,
you've fostered helpers, chasers,

15:29.596 --> 15:33.141
and some very adorable puppies
who needed a little extra attention.

15:33.225 --> 15:36.228
But Jack, he's sui generis.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.814
Is that another one
of your grandma's words?

15:38.897 --> 15:41.149
No. It's Latin for...

15:42.776 --> 15:44.695
"in a category by himself."

15:46.196 --> 15:48.031
So he doesn't like to be left alone.

15:48.115 --> 15:51.493
-And he doesn't like other dogs.
-Who doesn't like other dogs?

15:52.202 --> 15:55.497
This guy.
Today didn't really go as planned.

15:56.582 --> 15:57.708
Is he all right?

15:57.791 --> 15:59.501
He will be, eventually.

15:59.585 --> 16:02.921
He just needs to be
the only dog in the house.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.423
Or the dog park.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.342
And you needed
all this to figure that out?

16:07.426 --> 16:09.219
No, we were just bored.

16:09.887 --> 16:13.307
Well, when you're done,
you might want to check on your sister.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.893
I don't think today went as planned
for her either.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.604
-Okay.
-Okay.

16:26.111 --> 16:29.865
-So, what are you gonna do about Kit?
-I was able to track down her email,

16:29.948 --> 16:32.284
and I'm sending her
a really nice message...

16:33.410 --> 16:35.913
-now.
-Okay, that's a start.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.664
But give her a few days to respond.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.834
Remember, worrying is not gonna
make her get back to you any faster.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.755
I just got an email from Kit!

16:44.838 --> 16:46.882
Stop it! Uh, what did she say?

16:46.965 --> 16:51.053
"Kit Smithers is out of the office.
Due to the high volume of messages,

16:51.136 --> 16:53.555
she's not able to reply to you
at this time."

16:54.056 --> 16:55.474
Not her best work.

16:56.934 --> 17:00.521
What was I thinking?
I mean, she's a busy adult.

17:00.604 --> 17:04.066
She doesn't have time for
special requests from some random kid.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.818
You're not a random kid.
You're her biggest fan.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.530
Well, I'm certainly not her friend.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.031
So, what do you wanna do?

17:12.115 --> 17:14.076
I don't know.
I have to think of something.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.828
I'll try to think of something too.
Talk later.

17:16.912 --> 17:18.789
'Kay. Bye.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.335
We came to cheer you up.
It was Jack's idea.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.048
All I wanted was
to get into Maria's book club.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.551
But I lied to them
and messed everything up.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.636
I don't know why you'd need to lie.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.264
But I also don't know
why you'd need a book club.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.349
-You can always watch the movie.
-Charles.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.018
I'm trying to cheer you up, remember?

17:40.102 --> 17:42.479
I told them
I was good friends with Kit Smithers

17:42.563 --> 17:44.857
and that I'd bring her to our meeting
on Sunday.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.901
And she hasn't even returned my emails.

17:47.985 --> 17:51.113
But you said she'd be
at Cozy Nook Books on Saturday.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.115
Why don't you just ask her then?

17:53.198 --> 17:56.910
-I'm done bothering her.
-But you don't know if you bothered her.

17:56.994 --> 17:59.454
Maybe she's just really busy,
like you said.

17:59.538 --> 18:02.207
You were eavesdropping? Rude!

18:02.291 --> 18:05.711
No. I didn't wanna walk in
while you were talking to Maria.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.629
That would have been rude.

18:07.713 --> 18:08.714
Right.

18:11.175 --> 18:13.427
Is there anything I can do to help?

18:13.510 --> 18:15.304
Not unless you know Kit Smithers.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.349
Here's what I do know.

18:19.433 --> 18:22.936
When we're trying to find a home
for a puppy, you never give up.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.439
So I don't see why
you'd give up on this either.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.274
Come on, Lizzie.

18:27.357 --> 18:30.611
Jack and I will walk with you
to the bookstore for moral support.

18:31.111 --> 18:34.907
You just want me to buy you a copy of
the new Majestic Dog Warrior comic book.

18:34.990 --> 18:36.450
What you do with your allowance

18:36.533 --> 18:38.660
is none of my business.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.079
And it's not a comic book. It's manga.

18:41.163 --> 18:44.458
Any leads on finding Jack a home?

18:45.459 --> 18:47.002
Right now, just one.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.963
Well, that's great. If it's the right one.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.965
I'm not getting my hopes up.

18:56.428 --> 18:57.429
Well?

18:57.513 --> 18:59.056
I'm thinking.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.724
Thinking about adopting?

19:01.433 --> 19:05.437
Or about all the things you're gonna find
wrong with him, like you usually do?

19:06.605 --> 19:11.485
There's nothing wrong with him.
He seems friendly. And I like his ears.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.695
Remember, he doesn't like other dogs.

19:13.779 --> 19:16.949
I don't have other dogs.
This could be a great match.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.867
-Really?
-Totally.

19:18.951 --> 19:20.285
That's amazing!

19:20.369 --> 19:24.706
But the thing is that he's a boxer,
and that reminds me of boxing.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.875
And boxing is about striking.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.962
-And as a practitioner of Judo--
-I knew it.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.260
-Hi, Dario.
-Hey, Lizzie.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.680
-I was wondering--
-Is the new Majestic Dog Warrior in yet?

19:39.763 --> 19:41.557
It's over in comic books.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.560
-Yes, I know it's manga.
-Okay. Thanks.

19:44.643 --> 19:47.020
That couldn't wait
until after Kit's reading?

19:47.104 --> 19:48.105
Nope.

19:50.065 --> 19:53.485
-Can I ask you a favor?
-Anything for my best customer.

19:53.569 --> 19:54.862
Is it possible for you

19:54.945 --> 19:57.573
-to introduce me to K--
-Excuse me.

19:57.656 --> 19:58.907
Dar...

19:58.991 --> 20:01.743
-Er-- I'm sorry.
-It's Dario, Ms. Smithers.

20:01.827 --> 20:04.496
Well, it's Kit, not Ms. Smithers.

20:04.580 --> 20:08.959
And as you might be able to tell,
I seem to have misplaced my glasses.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.794
I'll check the lost and found.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.922
Hi, Kit.

20:14.006 --> 20:15.340
Hello.

20:15.424 --> 20:16.717
I'm your biggest fan.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.595
Maybe not your biggest.
I don't know how to quantify that.

20:19.678 --> 20:22.139
But I did write you a letter
and you wrote me back.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.141
But, of course, it got all chewed up.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.352
But I still put it in a frame
because you're, well, Kit Smithers!

20:27.436 --> 20:31.231
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Now, if you'll excuse me--

20:31.315 --> 20:33.817
You mentioned in your letter
that your fans inspire you.

20:33.901 --> 20:34.902
You're welcome.

20:34.985 --> 20:36.528
I mean, thank you.

20:36.612 --> 20:40.157
So, I was wondering if you might be able
to make a special guest appearance

20:40.240 --> 20:41.533
at my book club tomorrow?

20:41.617 --> 20:44.328
Delicious, literary-themed snacks
guaranteed.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.663
I'm sorry.

20:46.747 --> 20:49.333
-No one turned them in.
-That's distressing.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.543
Hard to do a book reading
when you can't read.

20:51.627 --> 20:54.588
I think I have an extra pair in my car.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.342
I am sorry, dear,

20:58.425 --> 21:02.638
but visiting my fans' book clubs,
it's just not something I do.

21:03.555 --> 21:07.392
-But I hope you'll stay for the reading.
-Yeah.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.063
Of course.

21:11.563 --> 21:12.564
So?

21:13.857 --> 21:17.861
So Kit has no idea who I am,
and she's not even coming to my book club.

21:17.945 --> 21:20.656
-I don't know what I'm gonna do, Charles.
-Me neither.

21:20.739 --> 21:22.908
They're sold out of Majestic Dog Warrior.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.160
Now I have nothing to read
during the reading.

21:26.328 --> 21:29.873
You don't have to stay,
but I appreciate that you would.

21:30.541 --> 21:32.459
Plus, Jack's gonna be bored.

21:35.921 --> 21:37.339
Are you sure?

21:37.422 --> 21:39.258
Yeah, I'm sure.

21:40.175 --> 21:42.719
Okay, thanks. Come on, Jack.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.610
Hey, Maria. What are you doing here?

21:58.694 --> 22:01.446
Remember when we were trying
to figure out the Kit situation

22:01.530 --> 22:03.448
and I said I'd try to think of something?

22:03.532 --> 22:06.201
-Well, I thought of something.
-Okay.

22:06.285 --> 22:08.871
I told Daphne and Vincent
Kit had to leave early tomorrow

22:08.954 --> 22:11.832
and wouldn't be able to make it,
and that you argued with her,

22:11.915 --> 22:14.668
"But, Kit, you promised.
You can't let my book club down."

22:15.169 --> 22:16.628
Did they believe you?

22:16.712 --> 22:20.257
100%. Not only that,
I told them how terrible you feel,

22:20.340 --> 22:22.050
and they said it's totally fine.

22:22.134 --> 22:25.179
Wait, so, does this mean
I'm still in the book club?

22:25.762 --> 22:27.264
Maria, that's amazing.

22:27.347 --> 22:30.684
-No, it-- it's not.
-Wait, what?

22:31.268 --> 22:32.603
There she is.

22:32.686 --> 22:34.313
Lizzie!

22:34.396 --> 22:37.065
Maria filled us in. Don't worry.
It wasn't your fault.

22:37.149 --> 22:39.151
Besides,
you can introduce her to us today.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.778
I can't wait to tell her
how much we love her new book.

22:41.862 --> 22:45.574
And she can join us for tea after all
the regular people get their books signed.

22:46.325 --> 22:47.868
I love being a VIP.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.377
I have something to tell you both.

22:59.463 --> 23:01.256
I don't really know Kit Smithers.

23:02.424 --> 23:05.761
I wrote her a letter. She wrote me back.
But that was it.

23:06.762 --> 23:11.517
I really wanted to be in your book club.
And I don't have a pool, so I panicked.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.727
If I can have
everyone's attention.

23:13.810 --> 23:18.398
Please give a warm Cozy Nook welcome
to Kit Smithers.

23:23.654 --> 23:27.741
Thank you all for coming.
What a beautiful shop.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.868
I understand why you did what you did.

23:29.952 --> 23:31.828
-Before we jump in...
-Really?

23:31.912 --> 23:34.414
Totally. Daphne's another story.

23:34.498 --> 23:38.627
...I'd like to share a quick story
from my own far less eventful life.

23:39.378 --> 23:40.754
As some of you might know,

23:40.838 --> 23:44.466
I recently had to say goodbye
to my best friend, my dog, Kaboodle.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.761
Kaboodle lived a long and wonderful life,

23:47.845 --> 23:51.598
but my heart hasn't been the same
since he passed.

23:51.682 --> 23:52.683
That's why,

23:52.766 --> 23:57.229
when I saw an adorable boxer puppy
in the parking lot ten minutes ago,

23:57.312 --> 23:59.439
I had to say hello.

23:59.523 --> 24:02.901
The young man walking him recognized me
and we chatted a bit,

24:02.985 --> 24:06.446
and I realized
he was actually a little upset with me.

24:06.947 --> 24:08.073
No.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.993
But we quickly worked it out.

24:11.076 --> 24:14.997
And that's why I wanna take this time
to thank a very special person,

24:15.747 --> 24:17.124
Lizzie Peterson...

24:18.208 --> 24:23.714
who, I now remember, sent me one of
the loveliest and most thoughtful letters

24:23.797 --> 24:25.007
I've ever received.

24:26.258 --> 24:28.802
Thanks to Lizzie and her brother, Charles,

24:28.886 --> 24:33.182
my new best friend, Jack, and I
will be heading home to Vermont together.

24:33.265 --> 24:34.683
What?

24:34.766 --> 24:37.269
That is so cool.

24:40.272 --> 24:44.484
Anyway, let's see what
Becca Baxter's been up to, shall we?

24:45.068 --> 24:46.904
This is from chapter six,

24:46.987 --> 24:52.159
where Becca and Sardo find themselves
in the middle of a drafty, dark castle.

24:55.078 --> 24:58.540
Why would she wait until the last chapter
to introduce the character of Benjamin?

24:59.124 --> 25:03.337
Honestly, knowing Kit Smithers,
I bet we'll find out in her next book.

25:03.962 --> 25:05.506
What do you guys think?

25:10.177 --> 25:11.136
Anybody else?
