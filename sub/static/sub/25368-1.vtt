00:00.067 --> 00:01.565
<i>Previously on "Shades of Blue"...</i>

00:01.600 --> 00:03.520
<i>Lower the weapon, Detective Santos.</i>

00:03.545 --> 00:04.778
It's you who's under arrest.

00:04.813 --> 00:08.749
<i>Wozniak's convinced that
Saperstein's the mole.</i>

00:08.783 --> 00:09.917
<i>She's an escort</i>

00:09.951 --> 00:11.418
- What's your name?
- Harlee.

00:11.452 --> 00:13.677
Robert, your badge.

00:13.678 --> 00:15.245
<i>Stahl's unstable.</i>

00:15.280 --> 00:16.245
<i>He's become obsessed with me,</i>

00:16.280 --> 00:17.247
<i>and none of us feel safe.</i>

00:17.282 --> 00:18.916
<i>Your secrets have poisoned you.</i>

00:18.950 --> 00:20.551
But soon I'm gonna heal you.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.653
This is between us and Quince.

00:22.687 --> 00:25.556
You weren't supposed to look
in this bag here, were you?

00:25.590 --> 00:27.591
It's one thing running drugs;
it's a whole other thing

00:27.626 --> 00:29.760
when you make a little kid do it!

00:29.794 --> 00:32.396
My future is here with you.

00:32.430 --> 00:34.601
'Cause I love you.
I'm not going anywhere.

00:35.266 --> 00:37.771
<i>If you thought I was gonna
let you go that easily...</i>

00:38.803 --> 00:40.437
What did you do to me?

00:40.462 --> 00:42.776
<i>Your clothes got a little
dirty when I moved you.</i>

00:43.441 --> 00:44.842
Damn it!

00:44.876 --> 00:46.410
Why would you do this to yourself?

00:46.444 --> 00:47.411
Help me.

00:52.283 --> 00:53.283
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

00:53.318 --> 00:54.585
Quince took my mom.

00:56.321 --> 00:57.588
Somebody!

The witness will state her name, rank,

01:12.704 --> 01:14.438
and precinct for the record.

01:22.013 --> 01:23.380
Harlee Grace Santos,

01:23.415 --> 01:26.450
detective first grade, Brooklyn,

01:26.484 --> 01:28.111
the six four.

01:28.145 --> 01:30.688
You're assigned to
Lieutenant Matt Wozniak's

01:30.722 --> 01:32.556
so-called anti-crime unit.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.992
My duty and my home
for the past ten years.

01:35.026 --> 01:36.860
Except for a recent leave of absence,

01:36.895 --> 01:39.463
after which you underwent
psychological evaluation,

01:39.497 --> 01:40.531
is that right?

01:42.169 --> 01:43.458
Yes.

01:43.459 --> 01:46.127
And do you concur with
the assessment that cleared you

01:46.162 --> 01:49.297
for duty so soon
after a traumatizing abduction?

01:50.666 --> 01:53.263
I was shaky at first, but...

01:53.803 --> 01:55.437
I'm recovered now.

01:55.471 --> 01:57.372
I think it's important
to establish for the record

01:57.406 --> 01:59.441
that the events to which
you're about to testify

01:59.475 --> 02:03.178
took place after you survived
the ordeal in the woods

02:03.212 --> 02:05.347
and with your abductor still at large.

02:05.381 --> 02:08.027
Are you asking if I'm a reliable witness?

02:08.633 --> 02:10.551
If... if I'm crazy?

02:10.586 --> 02:12.287
Some of your actions after the incident

02:12.321 --> 02:14.289
could be perceived that way:

02:14.323 --> 02:15.824
rash, impulsive.

02:15.858 --> 02:17.492
I'm not gonna pretend
that former Agent Stahl

02:17.527 --> 02:19.540
didn't have an effect on me...

02:21.330 --> 02:25.963
more than I even knew or was
willing to admit to myself,

02:27.503 --> 02:29.371
But not in the way
that you're suggesting.

02:29.405 --> 02:31.473
In what way then?

02:31.507 --> 02:33.637
In the path that I've chosen;

02:34.343 --> 02:36.478
the decisions I've made;

02:36.512 --> 02:38.754
in the cop that I'm trying to be.

02:38.789 --> 02:40.482
So much so that now you're willing to

02:40.516 --> 02:44.853
identify criminal corruption
within the NYPD?

02:44.887 --> 02:46.655
I am.

02:46.689 --> 02:48.657
And how would you
characterize the corruption?

02:49.570 --> 02:51.493
Obstruction,

02:51.527 --> 02:53.240
racketeering...

02:54.283 --> 02:55.282
and murder.

02:56.435 --> 02:58.667
Involving active duty police officers?

02:59.788 --> 03:01.169
Correct.

03:01.203 --> 03:02.337
Including yourself?

03:04.907 --> 03:06.708
In a manner of speaking.

03:06.742 --> 03:08.743
Well, that begs the question

03:08.778 --> 03:12.009
and really defines this whole hearing.

03:12.782 --> 03:14.616
Detective Santos,
do you consider yourself

03:14.650 --> 03:18.219
more of a police officer or a criminal?

03:18.254 --> 03:19.683
Honestly?

03:22.144 --> 03:23.858
Depends on the day.

03:26.796 --> 03:28.775
Order, please.

03:29.231 --> 03:31.600
Then pick a day, Detective.

Last call is over, beautiful.

03:48.818 --> 03:50.756
I wasn't looking for a drink.

04:04.767 --> 04:06.267
Bang!

04:06.302 --> 04:08.436
Always secure your vehicle, Loman.

04:08.471 --> 04:10.405
A simple rap on the window
would have sufficed.

04:10.439 --> 04:12.907
I saw an opportunity
for a teaching moment.

04:14.810 --> 04:17.579
Yeah, you're six hours
too early for that.

04:17.613 --> 04:19.247
We ordered a "Welcome Back" cake.

04:19.281 --> 04:20.327
Oh, yeah?

04:20.983 --> 04:22.417
What's the play here?

04:22.451 --> 04:24.252
Ah, just a flyer.

04:24.286 --> 04:26.821
Bartender started peddling
fentanyl about a week ago.

04:26.856 --> 04:27.956
We thought we'd obtain a sample

04:27.990 --> 04:30.212
to compare to Quince's old stash.

04:30.993 --> 04:32.827
Wait, how did you know we were here?

04:32.862 --> 04:33.995
Make it a pie.

04:34.030 --> 04:35.797
- What?
- A "Welcome Back" pie.

04:35.831 --> 04:37.432
I'm not a frosting guy.

04:37.466 --> 04:38.933
Pies don't have enough slices.

04:38.968 --> 04:40.468
You think I'm gonna share?

04:44.907 --> 04:46.374
You're out late.

04:46.409 --> 04:48.276
I didn't realize
it was a full moon tonight.

04:48.310 --> 04:50.679
That bartender must have ice
in his veins.

04:50.713 --> 04:52.547
Uh-uh. His hormones are functional.

04:52.581 --> 04:54.883
Just can't get him to sell me
any fentanyl.

04:54.917 --> 04:56.518
He's probably thinking cop.

04:56.552 --> 04:58.782
Well, let's confirm it for him.

04:59.755 --> 05:02.891
You plant it, Loman, cuff him,
and I'll watch.

05:02.925 --> 05:06.190
Or we all go home and
get a warrant in the morning.

05:06.225 --> 05:08.329
And let Quince
slip through our fingers again?

05:08.364 --> 05:09.964
I could call your wife
and get her opinion.

05:09.999 --> 05:11.466
She'd say if there's an opportunity

05:11.500 --> 05:13.468
to get the man who almost had me killed

05:13.502 --> 05:15.904
and he's in the city
still selling his poison

05:15.938 --> 05:17.906
that it's worth applying some pressure.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.374
We haven't stirred up enough dirt

05:19.408 --> 05:20.475
that's ended up in our faces?

05:20.509 --> 05:23.025
What, that bullet in your gut
not painful enough?

05:23.060 --> 05:25.980
It's a dime bag on a drug dealer.

05:26.015 --> 05:27.582
We're not robbing a bank.

05:29.919 --> 05:31.486
- Was that...
- Yeah.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.687
One block, maybe two.

05:34.523 --> 05:36.153
Let's go be good police.

05:37.526 --> 05:40.762
Dispatch, tango 9303
responding to shots fired

05:40.796 --> 05:43.098
around the 800 block of Sunrise Avenue.

05:43.132 --> 05:46.034
Roger that, 303, do you have
visual on a suspect?

05:46.068 --> 05:48.748
Right there, shattered glass
straight ahead.

05:49.371 --> 05:51.406
Negative. Roll back units to 815 Sunrise.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.474
Officers on site.

05:52.508 --> 05:55.368
Loman, take the wheel
and do a perimeter check.

05:55.402 --> 05:56.529
Who's on point?

05:56.563 --> 05:58.546
I remember how to kick in a door.

06:07.923 --> 06:10.812
Sure you wouldn't rather
be shaking down the dealer?

06:12.094 --> 06:13.895
Dinner's still warm.

06:16.398 --> 06:18.032
Uh, do you think minimum wage

06:18.067 --> 06:20.568
put up a fight for the register?

06:21.510 --> 06:23.211
Not against a gun.

07:01.043 --> 07:02.410
NYPD!

07:25.901 --> 07:27.049
Harlee, you clear?

07:27.083 --> 07:28.096
Yeah, just making sure

07:28.130 --> 07:30.138
no one stayed behind to do the dishes.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.367
Drop the weapon! Hands in the air!

08:12.748 --> 08:14.182
You my backup?

08:14.216 --> 08:16.374
Do it now. On the ground.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.853
You lead with "police," genius.

08:18.888 --> 08:21.192
Good way to get yourself shot.

08:22.317 --> 08:24.085
Police! Freeze!

08:30.866 --> 08:32.371
Harlee, you still there?

08:32.405 --> 08:33.466
Let me see your badge.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.565
Drop it. Police.

08:34.599 --> 08:36.537
Stand down.

08:36.572 --> 08:37.672
Stand down.

08:37.706 --> 08:39.177
He's with me.

08:39.211 --> 08:40.929
I lost a runner.

08:40.964 --> 08:43.756
All right, well, go out back
and try to find Harlee.

08:45.268 --> 08:46.234
Put your gun down.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.692
We're all on the same team.

08:48.217 --> 08:49.918
Put your gun down.

08:56.772 --> 08:58.640
Five victims.

08:58.665 --> 09:00.700
It's a staged robbery.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.014
Damn it, Parker.

09:07.603 --> 09:09.324
You knew him?

09:12.241 --> 09:13.912
He's my partner.

09:14.402 --> 09:16.636
NYPD intelligence unit.

09:23.050 --> 09:24.306
Turn around!

09:24.331 --> 09:25.465
Hands where I can see 'em.

09:38.847 --> 09:40.448
You're not gonna shoot me, are...

10:21.929 --> 10:23.962
- Oh, my god.
- Harlee!

10:24.330 --> 10:25.564
Harlee!

10:25.598 --> 10:26.565
Harlee!

10:26.599 --> 10:28.033
Harlee, are you hurt?

10:28.067 --> 10:29.034
Are you hurt? Look at me.

10:29.068 --> 10:30.035
Look at me.

10:30.069 --> 10:31.036
Is any of this blood yours?

10:31.070 --> 10:32.407
No.

10:33.339 --> 10:35.034
He's dead.

10:36.609 --> 10:38.577
Oh, my god.

10:42.915 --> 10:44.149
Did you see anyone else?

10:44.183 --> 10:47.672
He turned, and I recognized him.

10:48.254 --> 10:49.588
- I saw...
- His gun.

10:50.523 --> 10:52.424
You saw his gun.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.459
He ran away from the crime scene.

10:54.494 --> 10:56.595
No, Loman. No more.

11:02.201 --> 11:04.169
You were on foot pursuit.

11:04.203 --> 11:05.470
You cornered the suspect; he turned.

11:05.505 --> 11:07.439
- No, Loman.
- He aimed his gun at you.

11:10.276 --> 11:11.476
- And fired his weapon.
- Loman!

11:23.122 --> 11:24.323
Harlee.

11:26.125 --> 11:28.260
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

11:28.294 --> 11:31.496
<i>Uh, a woman, she's, uh... she's bleeding.</i>

11:31.531 --> 11:34.266
<i>She... she cut her wrist wide open.</i>

11:34.300 --> 11:35.634
<i>Can you tell me where you are?</i>

11:35.668 --> 11:38.370
<i>872 Deerfield Road.</i>

11:38.404 --> 11:40.505
<i>Hurry up. She's losing a lot of blood.</i>

11:40.540 --> 11:42.259
<i>Do you have a clean cloth or towel</i>

11:42.284 --> 11:44.276
<i>you can use to apply pressure
on the wound?</i>

11:44.302 --> 11:47.112
She is unconscious,
and she needs help right now.

11:47.146 --> 11:48.280
<i>I need you to stay with her.</i>

11:48.314 --> 11:49.648
<i>Can you feel her pulse?</i>

11:49.682 --> 11:51.116
<i>There's no time.</i>

11:51.150 --> 11:52.117
There's no time.

11:52.151 --> 11:53.118
<i>Try talking to her.</i>

11:53.152 --> 11:54.152
<i>Let me know she responds.</i>

11:54.187 --> 11:55.620
<i>I... I... I can't.</i>

11:55.655 --> 11:58.156
<i>Stay with me. You can do this.</i>

11:58.191 --> 11:59.157
<i>What is your name?</i>

12:00.560 --> 12:03.128
Thought you said you were
gonna delete that.

12:03.162 --> 12:06.131
Turns out erasing
was trickier than I thought.

12:07.544 --> 12:09.201
Come on. I'll make you some coffee.

12:09.235 --> 12:10.880
I saw him again.

12:14.479 --> 12:15.546
Stahl?

12:18.444 --> 12:20.265
He was right there.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.034
And then he wasn't.

12:23.518 --> 12:25.150
I could swear...

12:25.184 --> 12:26.685
that he was real.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.154
Okay, that's your mind telling you

12:29.188 --> 12:31.156
you can't act as if it never happened.

12:33.134 --> 12:35.866
Baby, you can't always be sprinting.

12:36.847 --> 12:40.766
When I stop, my mind is too loud.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.537
Come here.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.835
Maybe it wants an audience.

12:50.209 --> 12:52.422
You never proposed a theory.

12:53.498 --> 12:55.098
Where Stahl is?

12:55.633 --> 12:57.716
Why he saved my life.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.887
If I had to guess?

13:01.220 --> 13:03.422
So you'd be in your bathroom
four months later,

13:03.456 --> 13:04.723
still fixated on him.

13:04.757 --> 13:06.060
Yeah.

13:06.626 --> 13:07.726
He'd like that.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.814
But you are safe now.

13:10.763 --> 13:12.364
It's over.

13:12.398 --> 13:13.580
Stahl is a fugitive,

13:13.614 --> 13:16.268
and he'd be crazy to come
anywhere near us.

13:19.572 --> 13:22.577
I'm starting to think that
crazy is contagious.

13:23.509 --> 13:25.830
Well, don't worry. I got vaccinated.

13:28.427 --> 13:29.527
Come on.

13:32.351 --> 13:34.419
I killed a man tonight.

13:43.763 --> 13:45.430
Welcome back, boss.

13:45.465 --> 13:47.132
Sorry. Janitorial promised me

13:47.166 --> 13:48.300
they'd have it cleaned out by yesterday.

13:48.334 --> 13:50.435
There's urinal cakes on my sofa!

13:50.470 --> 13:52.671
There was a flood on the
second floor storage area.

13:52.705 --> 13:54.172
Linoleum's been drying for a month.

13:54.207 --> 13:56.241
So use the conference room.

13:56.275 --> 13:58.643
They're still spraying it for roaches.

14:00.546 --> 14:02.247
How long has Loman been in there?

14:02.281 --> 14:04.316
Verco's been grilling him
for about half an hour.

14:04.350 --> 14:06.351
The kid looked confident going in.

14:06.385 --> 14:08.653
Well, he better be. It's his story.

14:08.688 --> 14:10.522
Did Harlee rotate through?

14:10.556 --> 14:12.657
Internal affairs record. 18 minutes.

14:12.692 --> 14:13.882
Hey! Hey!

14:13.916 --> 14:16.528
I thought I told you two to
meet me this morning outside.

14:16.562 --> 14:18.430
We did. Linda said you left early.

14:18.464 --> 14:20.365
The precinct, not my house!

14:20.399 --> 14:22.267
What, did they confiscate brain cells

14:22.301 --> 14:24.269
when they took your detective shields?

14:24.303 --> 14:25.637
Disciplinary demotion is bad enough,

14:25.671 --> 14:28.173
but I have to ride around
with him all day.

14:28.207 --> 14:29.868
Any word on those shields, Woz?

14:29.902 --> 14:31.062
Yeah, you'll get them.

14:31.096 --> 14:34.179
But the first order of
business is to get Quince.

14:34.213 --> 14:35.607
I'll pound rocks for you, Woz.

14:35.641 --> 14:38.116
I mean, Quince is out of prison
because we screwed up.

14:38.150 --> 14:40.218
But the man is well aware he
crossed a line. He's a ghost.

14:40.253 --> 14:43.121
Maybe, but we're gonna
cycle though every rat hole,

14:43.155 --> 14:45.123
every associate, every rumor,

14:45.157 --> 14:47.158
starting with last night's bartender.

14:47.193 --> 14:48.838
Whoa, whoa, whoa; we're
already late for roll call.

14:48.872 --> 14:50.295
Unless you can write us a tardy slip.

14:50.329 --> 14:52.500
Call my cell when you're rolling.

14:53.266 --> 14:54.799
And you, lose the suit.

14:54.834 --> 14:56.618
It's not gonna impress
the company we're meeting.

14:56.652 --> 14:57.758
Can't today, boss.

14:57.792 --> 15:00.633
I got a supervise a whodunit
I'm working for homicide.

15:02.608 --> 15:04.442
Great to be back.

15:18.457 --> 15:19.986
Working a theory?

15:20.729 --> 15:22.827
Slain cop, that's a career-making case.

15:22.862 --> 15:24.496
Look, I'm not trying to
poach; I'm just...

15:24.530 --> 15:25.864
Second-guessing?

15:25.898 --> 15:28.119
Car kind of just drove me here.

15:29.535 --> 15:31.289
I must have the same model.

15:32.373 --> 15:33.833
I'm sorry...

15:34.773 --> 15:36.541
about your partner.

15:43.883 --> 15:45.617
Did the place speak to you?

15:45.651 --> 15:47.886
You know, sometimes you stand
in a crime scene long enough,

15:47.920 --> 15:51.893
you listen, you know, real quiet as if

15:52.892 --> 15:55.193
they'll tell you their secrets.

15:55.227 --> 15:57.362
You can almost see it play out.

15:59.231 --> 16:01.633
First shot was fired at your partner.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.154
Parker.

16:03.636 --> 16:05.403
His name was Parker.

16:05.438 --> 16:07.074
Parker...

16:07.773 --> 16:10.077
was sitting here with someone.

16:10.676 --> 16:12.644
Stands up to face his killer.

16:12.678 --> 16:14.913
Sees a threat; protective
instincts kick in.

16:14.947 --> 16:16.881
Get him shot in the head from
no more than four feet away.

16:16.916 --> 16:18.917
Suggests it was personal.

16:18.951 --> 16:20.552
Do you know why he was here?

16:21.172 --> 16:23.257
I'm working on it.

16:23.956 --> 16:27.258
He fires back, almost simultaneously.

16:27.293 --> 16:30.640
Probably dead before the bullet
hits the door right over there.

16:31.697 --> 16:32.931
You think this was planned?

16:32.965 --> 16:34.685
In public? No.

16:35.601 --> 16:39.732
The other victims
were just afterthoughts.

16:41.273 --> 16:43.575
A diner full of witnesses won't do.

16:43.609 --> 16:44.843
Only the shooter's interrupted

16:44.877 --> 16:46.490
before he can sweep the kitchen.

16:46.524 --> 16:47.644
He hears sirens.

16:47.679 --> 16:49.244
Walks right out the front door.

16:49.278 --> 16:51.061
Probably the suspect who got away

16:51.096 --> 16:53.284
that my crewmember
chased down the street.

16:54.163 --> 16:56.249
And the man you chased?

16:57.857 --> 16:59.691
Why don't you answer my questions

16:59.725 --> 17:00.925
before you start asking ones

17:00.960 --> 17:02.460
you already have the answers to.

17:03.963 --> 17:04.963
I'm not an oracle.

17:04.997 --> 17:05.964
No.

17:05.998 --> 17:08.833
Guys are better than that.

17:08.867 --> 17:10.702
Intelligence unit.

17:10.736 --> 17:13.438
Special clearances, secret networks,

17:13.472 --> 17:15.272
international reach.

17:15.307 --> 17:17.442
Doesn't make us untouchable.

17:19.231 --> 17:20.632
Jeff Morris.

17:20.656 --> 17:22.625
The man I shot.

17:22.650 --> 17:26.089
37 years old, worked the docks
for the last ten.

17:26.115 --> 17:28.880
Survived only by an estranged ex-wife.

17:31.323 --> 17:32.877
Well, he's the mystery, isn't he?

17:34.026 --> 17:36.628
If he was an accomplice,
what was he waiting for?

17:36.662 --> 17:38.463
If he wasn't,
what was he doing with a gun?

17:38.497 --> 17:40.410
I'm leaning toward witness who escaped.

17:40.445 --> 17:43.368
A witness who pointed a gun at a cop.

17:45.705 --> 17:47.143
What was a longshoreman doing with a gun

17:47.177 --> 17:48.707
at the scene of a massacre?

17:51.510 --> 17:53.678
I didn't give him a chance to explain.

17:57.715 --> 17:59.448
Did you ever dress as anyone else?

17:59.473 --> 18:00.406
No.

18:00.431 --> 18:02.669
Agents all had very clear instructions.

18:02.819 --> 18:04.320
Always the wig.

18:04.354 --> 18:05.788
Always you.

18:05.822 --> 18:07.289
You were his fantasy.

18:07.324 --> 18:08.991
Did he tell you what to say?

18:09.026 --> 18:11.327
I'd improvise. He'd correct me.

18:11.361 --> 18:14.285
Are you sure you want to
keep hearing all this?

18:14.698 --> 18:16.370
Until he's caught.

18:16.700 --> 18:20.041
So one time I called myself... you...

18:20.537 --> 18:21.908
a bad girl.

18:21.942 --> 18:23.239
And he stopped.

18:23.273 --> 18:26.008
And insisted that I was never
to call myself bad.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.811
I've done bad things.

18:28.845 --> 18:30.146
Maybe.

18:30.180 --> 18:32.803
But he saw them as survival.

18:42.859 --> 18:44.393
Same time next week?

18:51.701 --> 18:53.135
Checkmate.

18:53.170 --> 18:55.304
That's 12 in a row.

18:55.338 --> 18:56.705
You better not tell anyone.

19:01.445 --> 19:02.711
Hey.

19:02.746 --> 19:05.481
They already know I'm the cop you shot.

19:06.196 --> 19:08.547
Now they'll think you shot
an important one.

19:10.946 --> 19:12.388
I gotta go.

19:12.422 --> 19:14.690
But I'll be back in a few days, okay?

19:14.724 --> 19:16.826
You keep your head up.

19:16.860 --> 19:19.228
None of this was your fault.

19:19.262 --> 19:20.813
As far as I'm concerned,

19:20.847 --> 19:23.896
it was as if Quince
pulled the trigger himself.

19:30.087 --> 19:32.989
May those who love us, love us.

19:33.910 --> 19:35.444
May those who don't love us

19:35.479 --> 19:37.702
have their hearts turned by God.

19:38.381 --> 19:40.937
And if God can't turn their hearts,

19:40.937 --> 19:42.104
may he turn their ankles

19:42.138 --> 19:43.772
so that we'll know them by their limp.

19:45.074 --> 19:47.276
Parker would have liked that joke.

19:47.310 --> 19:50.045
He had a terrible sense of humor...

19:50.079 --> 19:52.147
apparently like all of you.

19:53.316 --> 19:54.950
For as long as I can remember,

19:54.984 --> 19:57.286
I've been running toward the chaos,

19:57.320 --> 19:59.922
not knowing what awaits in the darkness,

19:59.956 --> 20:01.456
just like the rest of you do,

20:01.491 --> 20:04.459
day in and day out;

20:04.494 --> 20:06.128
just like Parker did.

20:06.162 --> 20:07.996
I have watched far too many

20:08.031 --> 20:10.599
of our brothers and sisters
lowered into the earth.

20:10.633 --> 20:13.135
But after each solemn ceremony,

20:13.779 --> 20:16.171
I never wavered in my conviction.

20:16.206 --> 20:18.409
I never questioned my path.

20:19.642 --> 20:21.579
Fidelis ad mortem.

20:22.212 --> 20:24.580
Faithful unto death.

20:28.586 --> 20:30.463
Are you settled in?

20:32.021 --> 20:35.023
I'm aggravated. Does that count?

20:35.478 --> 20:37.479
You ever lose the taste for it?

20:38.846 --> 20:40.264
The job?

20:41.130 --> 20:43.332
Think maybe it's just time
to hang it all up?

20:43.366 --> 20:46.401
Not when there's a score to settle, no.

20:47.303 --> 20:48.503
So never.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.640
Look, you came back too soon is all.

20:51.674 --> 20:54.109
No wife to nag you back to bed.

20:54.143 --> 20:55.344
Oh, Nava's trying.

20:55.378 --> 20:57.112
I bet.

20:57.146 --> 20:58.647
No, I mean,

20:58.681 --> 21:00.349
he's great.

21:00.383 --> 21:03.385
You know, he says all the right things;

21:03.419 --> 21:05.621
does all the right things.

21:06.165 --> 21:08.357
It's like the more supportive he is,

21:08.391 --> 21:10.711
the harder it is
to leave the job at the door.

21:11.261 --> 21:12.961
So what, you gonna move upstate

21:12.996 --> 21:15.633
and see what your special casserole is?

21:17.033 --> 21:19.534
I shot an innocent man...

21:19.569 --> 21:22.037
the sole witness in a cop's murder...

21:22.071 --> 21:23.639
because I can't stop seeing Stahl.

21:23.673 --> 21:27.542
If the intelligence unit
can disappear terror suspects,

21:27.577 --> 21:30.379
they can close the file
on one of their own.

21:30.413 --> 21:32.900
And what if they figure out
what actually happened?

21:34.717 --> 21:38.020
Harlee, take a couple of days.

21:38.054 --> 21:40.336
I'm gonna duct tape the team together.

21:40.370 --> 21:42.284
I'm gonna bag Quince...

21:43.426 --> 21:46.662
And then we'll see
if the slipper still fits.

21:57.573 --> 21:59.942
I wish I'd gotten to know Saperstein.

21:59.976 --> 22:01.410
Annoying as hell.

22:01.444 --> 22:03.278
But a huge heart.

22:03.313 --> 22:05.247
Must be hard for you.

22:05.281 --> 22:06.375
You know?

22:06.963 --> 22:08.583
You know, I'm sorry, Loman.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.218
Nah, you don't have to apologize.

22:10.253 --> 22:12.587
No, I'm sorry for choosing for you.

22:12.622 --> 22:15.090
For deciding what kind of cop
you were gonna be

22:15.124 --> 22:17.059
before you had the chance to.

22:17.093 --> 22:19.294
I thought I knew better. I didn't.

22:19.329 --> 22:21.740
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

22:22.632 --> 22:23.868
Harlee, wait.

22:23.902 --> 22:25.567
Isn't that the officer from Sunrise?

22:28.471 --> 22:29.538
Yeah.

22:29.572 --> 22:30.916
The partner.

22:31.474 --> 22:34.503
He's arguing with the suspect
I chased outside the scene.

22:36.145 --> 22:37.145
Are you sure?

22:37.180 --> 22:39.014
You chased a cop?

22:41.317 --> 22:43.752
A cop who ran away from a massacre.

22:47.880 --> 22:48.934
Theo Bennett.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.141
Six years with vice before

22:50.166 --> 22:51.527
being recruited to join intelligence.

22:51.552 --> 22:53.748
So a member of his crew
gets shot in the head,

22:53.773 --> 22:56.525
and this experienced officer
flees from the scene.

22:56.776 --> 22:59.192
His only possible defense is
that he was chasing a suspect.

22:59.209 --> 23:01.079
Yeah, but he ran from you too.

23:02.472 --> 23:03.687
He must be involved.

23:03.712 --> 23:05.285
Their captain preaching about sacrifice

23:05.319 --> 23:07.077
when they killed one of their own?

23:08.746 --> 23:11.542
Some of them seem to be
genuinely mourning.

23:12.290 --> 23:14.158
I just finished with internal affairs.

23:14.877 --> 23:16.594
How do we go back in
and tell them all this?

23:16.628 --> 23:18.262
We don't.

23:18.296 --> 23:20.431
Lonely on the other side of
that blue wall.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.433
Anyone finds out we're
talking to internal affairs,

23:22.467 --> 23:23.601
and we're done as cops.

23:24.511 --> 23:27.514
So nothing to see here?

23:28.891 --> 23:30.574
We throw a lifeline.

23:38.216 --> 23:39.658
Thanks for coming.

23:39.692 --> 23:42.655
I know how difficult it is
to bury one of your own.

23:43.355 --> 23:47.691
If you need help outside your unit,

23:47.726 --> 23:49.160
you can reach me at the 64.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.462
Hitting on me at a funeral, are you?

23:51.496 --> 23:54.041
I think you knew your partner
was in danger.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.635
I think that's why
you were close by that night.

23:57.669 --> 24:00.422
Maybe already on your way to
Sunrise Café.

24:01.807 --> 24:04.175
And I think those few minutes
you were late

24:04.209 --> 24:06.210
are gonna haunt you
for the rest of your life.

24:07.471 --> 24:09.513
This is help?

24:09.548 --> 24:10.815
Sounds like an interrogation.

24:10.849 --> 24:13.435
Do you know why Parker was there?

24:13.761 --> 24:15.495
Or who would want to kill him?

24:15.530 --> 24:18.765
Darling, I don't know if this
is curiosity or compassion.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.768
But my advice? Walk away from this one.

24:21.803 --> 24:23.203
God knows I would if I could.

24:23.237 --> 24:24.438
If that were true, you would have let

24:24.472 --> 24:26.406
Bennett pose with the other mourners.

24:29.477 --> 24:32.345
Parker was meeting two people
at the Sunrise Café:

24:32.379 --> 24:33.680
the longshoreman that you killed

24:33.715 --> 24:35.382
and another dock worker named Orlando,

24:35.416 --> 24:37.384
only Orlando was too scared to show.

24:37.418 --> 24:38.719
What was Orlando so afraid of?

24:38.753 --> 24:40.120
That, you'll have to get from him.

24:40.154 --> 24:42.222
If I didn't have to offer condolences,

24:42.256 --> 24:43.757
I'd be swinging by 2561 Breemount

24:43.791 --> 24:44.758
within the next hour.

24:44.792 --> 24:46.526
Harlee, we gotta get going.

24:46.561 --> 24:48.228
I got a family thing to get to.

24:48.262 --> 24:50.130
Yeah, okay.

24:50.164 --> 24:54.267
Um, I mean, you can drop me
at the L if that's quicker.

24:54.302 --> 24:56.403
You're riding the subway
in your dress blues?

24:56.437 --> 24:58.143
Can't allow that, I'm afraid.

24:58.178 --> 25:00.240
We can give Detective Santos
a ride, can't we, Cole?

25:00.274 --> 25:01.441
Yes, sir.

25:01.476 --> 25:02.809
I'm sure you have other commitments.

25:02.844 --> 25:04.311
It's the least we can do after

25:04.345 --> 25:06.279
you put down the animal
who killed our man.

25:06.314 --> 25:07.647
Is that your theory:

25:08.282 --> 25:11.418
a longshoreman went on a killing spree?

25:11.452 --> 25:13.253
I'm confident that you'll not only

25:13.287 --> 25:14.865
be cleared by internal affairs,

25:14.900 --> 25:17.758
but you'll also prove to be the
only hero in this sad story,

25:17.792 --> 25:19.626
aside from our departed, of course.

25:21.536 --> 25:22.636
So what's it gonna be?

25:26.091 --> 25:27.567
Can we offer you that ride?

25:27.602 --> 25:29.302
No need, Captain.

25:29.337 --> 25:30.837
I'm taking her.

25:30.872 --> 25:32.906
I thought I heard you say
you had a family thing.

25:34.308 --> 25:36.410
Which I can make if we leave now.

25:36.444 --> 25:37.844
Flexibility:

25:38.206 --> 25:39.706
an underrated quality.

25:41.815 --> 25:43.316
Sorry for your loss.

25:43.351 --> 25:44.818
And we appreciate that.

25:46.788 --> 25:48.622
As much as I'm enjoying this workout,

25:48.656 --> 25:50.590
I gotta pick up my ingrates from school

25:50.625 --> 25:51.825
and my boss is not gonna let me leave

25:51.859 --> 25:53.293
till you give me an answer.

25:53.327 --> 25:57.464
So where is Quince?

25:57.498 --> 26:00.200
I think we're way past the
ten-count on this bartender.

26:00.234 --> 26:01.468
You want to relieve her?

26:01.502 --> 26:03.336
Nah. Let her work it out.

26:04.505 --> 26:05.898
Patrol car too tight?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.707
Now, don't get me wrong;
we're having a blast.

26:07.742 --> 26:09.810
But between the pay cut
and her deadbeat ex,

26:09.844 --> 26:12.479
I get an earful of crazy
eight hours a day.

26:12.513 --> 26:13.513
Try marriage.

26:15.683 --> 26:17.217
Okay.

26:17.251 --> 26:19.886
Quince has his number two
running the operation

26:19.921 --> 26:21.321
while he's been in hiding.

26:21.355 --> 26:22.556
Didn't need to put the guy

26:22.590 --> 26:24.017
through the blender to find that out.

26:24.020 --> 26:26.262
He has this kid Junior
acting like a courier,

26:26.287 --> 26:27.421
essentially he's been funneling money

26:27.446 --> 26:30.581
into whatever gopher hole
Quince's been burrowed up in.

26:30.665 --> 26:32.866
Does Junior have an address?

26:40.775 --> 26:43.210
2561 Breemount.

26:43.244 --> 26:46.379
Apparently Orlando's cousin
Teresa owns the psychic joint

26:46.414 --> 26:47.514
and the apartment above it.

26:48.850 --> 26:50.517
Hello, Teresa?

26:50.551 --> 26:51.852
This is Detective Harlee Santos

26:51.886 --> 26:53.587
of the New York City police department.

26:53.621 --> 26:55.722
Is your cousin Orlando there?

26:56.424 --> 26:58.692
No, we just wanted to ask him a
few questions.

26:58.726 --> 27:00.727
Is it okay if we stop by?

27:02.864 --> 27:04.264
Teresa?

27:08.595 --> 27:10.596
- She needs a new crystal ball.
- Mm-hmm.

27:12.807 --> 27:14.541
Orlando.

27:14.575 --> 27:15.867
Orlando Carter?

27:30.491 --> 27:31.558
Relax.

27:31.592 --> 27:32.559
We're here to help you.

27:32.593 --> 27:33.727
Yeah, I can tell right off.

27:38.966 --> 27:41.434
All right, I'm gonna let you up.

27:41.469 --> 27:43.895
But you gotta promise not to run.

27:45.339 --> 27:46.573
Come on. Get up.

27:47.842 --> 27:49.276
All right, I'm Detective Santos,

27:49.310 --> 27:50.477
and this is Detective Loman,

27:50.511 --> 27:53.313
and we're investigating the
murders at the Sunrise Café.

27:53.347 --> 27:55.303
- I never heard of the place.
- Really?

27:55.337 --> 27:56.765
'Cause we heard
you and your friend Morris

27:56.799 --> 27:59.252
were meeting a cop named Parker
there the other night.

27:59.287 --> 28:00.287
Don't worry.

28:00.321 --> 28:03.290
I don't remember any of that.
You have my word.

28:03.324 --> 28:04.824
You must have us confused
with some other unit.

28:04.859 --> 28:06.960
We're actually trying to solve
this murder.

28:08.035 --> 28:09.135
How do I know?

28:09.160 --> 28:10.830
Because you're still breathing.

28:10.865 --> 28:12.599
Okay, you're gonna have to trust us.

28:12.633 --> 28:13.833
Okay, Morris trusted that other cop,

28:13.868 --> 28:15.469
and now both of them are dead.

28:16.504 --> 28:17.804
Harlee.

28:20.875 --> 28:22.337
Orlando, you're gonna
have to come with us.

28:22.371 --> 28:23.443
I told Morris to let the cops

28:23.477 --> 28:24.783
clean up their own mess,
but he wouldn't listen.

28:24.817 --> 28:26.012
And that one cop sounded desperate.

28:26.047 --> 28:27.414
In the car now.

28:27.448 --> 28:28.949
See those cops?

28:28.983 --> 28:30.917
One of them went to the Sunrise
instead of you.

28:30.952 --> 28:32.085
Get in.

28:34.021 --> 28:36.356
You can go home and change, officers.

28:36.390 --> 28:37.857
We'll take the suspect from here.

28:37.892 --> 28:39.592
Oh, no, it's just a drunk and disorderly.

28:39.626 --> 28:41.461
That requires two detectives to solve?

28:41.912 --> 28:43.930
I was getting my fortune told.

28:43.965 --> 28:45.665
I can tell you how today ends.

28:47.668 --> 28:49.369
That man's a potential accomplice

28:49.403 --> 28:51.371
in the murder of a police officer.

28:51.405 --> 28:52.639
Yeah, do you have an arrest warrant?

28:52.673 --> 28:53.707
Do you?

28:53.741 --> 28:55.508
Thought we'd drive around
until he sobers up.

28:55.543 --> 28:57.477
Catch and release, I hope.

28:57.511 --> 28:58.612
Sorry for your loss.

29:13.327 --> 29:14.693
I must have tossed this block eight times

29:14.727 --> 29:15.662
in the past four months.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.729
Guess Quince mastered the
art of hiding in plain sight.

29:17.764 --> 29:18.882
Which house?

29:18.907 --> 29:20.414
Second house up on the right.

29:20.449 --> 29:22.181
Security footage
has this Junior character

29:22.216 --> 29:23.822
bringing in groceries three times a week.

29:23.822 --> 29:25.223
He's gotta be sneaking out product.

29:25.257 --> 29:27.577
No one puts a bullet in Quince but me.

29:27.602 --> 29:28.935
I want him alive.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.394
Understood?

29:31.562 --> 29:32.963
Police!

29:41.072 --> 29:43.974
Show me two hands
or I show you two bullets!

29:45.500 --> 29:46.934
Hello, Matt.

29:46.968 --> 29:48.269
I'm starving.

29:48.303 --> 29:49.570
I haven't eaten anything since breakfast.

29:49.604 --> 29:51.305
Funerals do that to you.

29:51.773 --> 29:53.040
Where's Quince?

29:53.075 --> 29:55.576
Mayonnaise, ketchup, and half a burrito.

29:55.610 --> 29:57.378
I guess he was ordering in.

29:57.412 --> 29:58.947
Ah.

29:59.948 --> 30:01.741
One beer left.

30:02.417 --> 30:04.202
What do you say we split it?

30:05.921 --> 30:07.222
- Police!
- NYPD!

30:08.262 --> 30:09.757
Woz, where are you?

30:09.791 --> 30:11.759
I'm in the kitchen. I'm good.

30:12.032 --> 30:13.166
We got a problem out here.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.734
Stand down.

30:14.768 --> 30:16.069
We're all friends.

30:16.103 --> 30:17.507
I'm glad to hear it.

30:18.172 --> 30:20.006
I need a little favor.

30:20.040 --> 30:21.874
Happy to repay it.

30:36.890 --> 30:39.192
This favor have a name?

30:39.226 --> 30:40.760
Orlando Carter.

30:40.794 --> 30:44.664
Two DUIs and an armed robbery
count in his 20s.

30:44.698 --> 30:46.099
He worked the docks with the longshoreman

30:46.133 --> 30:48.000
that I shot at the Sunrise Café.

30:48.035 --> 30:49.335
They were both there to meet Parker,

30:49.370 --> 30:51.904
the intelligence officer that got killed.

30:51.939 --> 30:53.072
But Orlando didn't show.

30:53.107 --> 30:54.815
He told you this?

30:54.850 --> 30:55.950
But he won't tell me

30:55.985 --> 30:57.588
what the meeting was about
without immunity.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.212
Immunity for what?

30:59.246 --> 31:00.800
Whatever the hell he's scared of.

31:00.835 --> 31:02.882
Have you booked our Sunrise suspect yet?

31:02.916 --> 31:05.302
Oh, just an informal chat
with a potential lead.

31:05.336 --> 31:07.019
Hold on, is he is he a
witness or an accomplice?

31:07.054 --> 31:08.221
That's what we're sorting out.

31:08.255 --> 31:09.956
Can you excuse us a minute, Counselor?

31:09.990 --> 31:11.057
Yeah.

31:14.228 --> 31:15.928
Ramsey has Quince.

31:15.963 --> 31:17.100
What, since when?

31:17.134 --> 31:19.899
Since you and Loman picked up
his person of interest.

31:19.933 --> 31:21.591
That wasn't even a couple of hours ago.

31:21.625 --> 31:23.236
How did you know to look for that guy?

31:23.270 --> 31:24.737
How did intel know where to find Quince?

31:24.772 --> 31:26.272
'Cause they have reach, Harlee.

31:27.341 --> 31:29.909
You know, Loman ID'd his
runner from the Sunrise Café.

31:29.943 --> 31:31.077
He's one of Ramsey's men.

31:31.111 --> 31:32.578
Yeah, I could do the math.

31:32.613 --> 31:34.113
And you want to deliver Orlando to them?

31:34.148 --> 31:36.115
No, I want you to.

31:36.150 --> 31:38.951
I'll be waiting for Quince
six blocks over.

31:38.986 --> 31:40.507
Fair trade.

31:41.288 --> 31:43.623
I know that Quince is personal.

31:43.657 --> 31:44.984
I get it.

31:45.019 --> 31:46.097
Stahl is personal.

31:46.131 --> 31:48.594
But we can't burn the city down
trying to find them.

31:48.629 --> 31:50.396
River Road, midnight.

31:50.431 --> 31:53.933
I get Quince at the same time
under Hell's Gate Bridge.

31:53.967 --> 31:55.401
I'm not gonna deliver a man to his death

31:55.436 --> 31:56.538
for your revenge fantasies.

31:56.572 --> 31:58.137
You have to do it.

31:58.172 --> 32:00.009
Ramsey's gotta know that
we're all on board.

32:00.044 --> 32:01.338
We're not all on board.

32:01.372 --> 32:03.158
Are you willing to take
a bullet for this guy?

32:03.192 --> 32:04.284
'Cause I'm not.

32:04.319 --> 32:06.112
If Orlando has evidence
that can take down Ramsey

32:06.146 --> 32:07.280
and his intelligence unit,

32:07.314 --> 32:08.848
then no one has to take a bullet.

32:08.882 --> 32:10.795
I'll take that all-comers, Harlee.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.952
But I gotta make the crew whole again.

32:12.986 --> 32:16.001
I'm not starting a war
with the secret police.

32:16.890 --> 32:19.292
They killed one of their own men, Woz.

32:19.754 --> 32:21.798
So did we.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.868
I don't even know what you're asking me.

32:28.902 --> 32:30.436
Were you and your friend
Morris engaged in

32:30.471 --> 32:33.139
illegal activities
with law enforcement officers?

32:40.414 --> 32:42.381
I think I know why he's not talking.

32:42.416 --> 32:44.317
Sorry, I may have
jumped the gun on this one.

32:44.351 --> 32:46.152
He just hinted that Parker
may have been talking

32:46.186 --> 32:47.453
with someone at internal affairs.

32:47.488 --> 32:48.988
Yeah, but I guess he's a CI

32:49.022 --> 32:51.357
that Parker cut loose for bad intel.

32:51.391 --> 32:52.453
He's playing us.

32:52.487 --> 32:55.328
His fear seems pretty genuine to me.

32:55.362 --> 32:57.205
I'm gonna transfer him
to One Police Plaza.

32:57.206 --> 32:58.674
Whoa, a few minutes ago,
you were convinced

32:58.708 --> 33:00.642
this guy was at risk
of being killed by police.

33:01.421 --> 33:03.845
Yeah, I'm... I'm off my game.

33:03.880 --> 33:04.980
I'm sorry.

33:09.585 --> 33:12.254
I guess old habits die hard
when your boss needs something.

33:18.328 --> 33:20.128
Deny knowing anything.

33:20.163 --> 33:21.997
Swear to forget and move on.

33:22.031 --> 33:23.732
It's your best chance.

33:23.766 --> 33:25.320
Chance?

33:25.902 --> 33:28.537
The second I open my mouth,
they'll stick a gun in it.

34:10.279 --> 34:11.346
I'm sorry.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.181
Okay? I really am.

34:13.216 --> 34:14.683
We're just caught in a stampede.

34:14.717 --> 34:15.817
I trusted you.

34:15.851 --> 34:18.219
You said you'd help; that you
weren't that kind of cop.

35:02.031 --> 35:03.265
No, you...

35:03.299 --> 35:04.565
No!

35:25.046 --> 35:25.945
Woz?

35:30.255 --> 35:31.589
Woz.

35:42.195 --> 35:44.792
Harlee, I didn't ask.

35:45.752 --> 35:49.468
When you were bleeding out
in that open field,

35:49.923 --> 35:52.338
did you get that feeling?

35:52.717 --> 35:54.206
Could you tell?

35:54.802 --> 35:56.342
That I might die?

35:58.890 --> 36:01.013
That you would die.

36:04.062 --> 36:06.898
When I was on the lobby floor,

36:07.941 --> 36:09.488
I knew it.

36:10.818 --> 36:13.225
I knew it for sure.

36:13.655 --> 36:15.628
And there was no peace in it.

36:16.241 --> 36:19.031
There was no bright light.

36:19.065 --> 36:20.453
There was just...

36:23.168 --> 36:24.802
fear.

36:25.672 --> 36:29.108
Fear and loneliness.

36:32.924 --> 36:36.515
Paramedics told me that I was
dead for two minutes.

36:37.178 --> 36:39.051
And yet, here you are.

36:39.085 --> 36:41.474
Guess we got a do-over.

36:42.028 --> 36:44.227
I intend to use mine.

36:45.191 --> 36:47.945
It's not a do-over unless
we make different choices.

36:47.979 --> 36:49.094
Where's Orlando?

36:49.129 --> 36:50.262
They were gonna kill him, Woz.

36:50.296 --> 36:51.697
You knew that when you cuffed him.

36:51.731 --> 36:54.266
To cover up a murder of one of their own.

36:54.300 --> 36:55.334
A cop.

36:55.368 --> 36:56.535
I made assurances.

36:56.569 --> 36:57.536
Where is he?

36:57.570 --> 36:58.771
Somewhere safe...

36:58.805 --> 37:00.406
far from Ramsey's reach.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.441
You can't stand where you're standing

37:02.475 --> 37:04.176
and pretend it's high ground.

37:04.210 --> 37:05.544
I'm not standing, Woz!

37:05.578 --> 37:06.745
Okay, I'm underwater.

37:06.780 --> 37:07.780
I can't breathe.

37:07.814 --> 37:09.682
I can't even reach the surface!

37:09.716 --> 37:11.216
Then let me make the decisions

37:11.251 --> 37:13.686
until you figure out which was is up.

37:14.549 --> 37:17.790
I need to be able to close my eyes

37:17.824 --> 37:19.725
and not see the things that I've done.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.226
These guys don't mess around.

37:21.261 --> 37:22.361
I know that.

37:22.395 --> 37:24.196
Then tell me where Orlando is.

37:24.230 --> 37:26.699
I've been telling myself
over and over again

37:26.733 --> 37:29.435
that I'm gonna do what I know is right,

37:29.469 --> 37:33.272
until there's some excuse
for me not to, and then I cave.

37:33.306 --> 37:34.807
This is where you draw the line?

37:34.841 --> 37:36.742
You're gonna break the blue wall

37:36.776 --> 37:39.211
against the intelligence division?

37:39.245 --> 37:42.581
You do not need to get Quince
to start over.

37:42.615 --> 37:46.251
Just take your second chance
and be grateful for it.

37:46.286 --> 37:47.820
And move on like you did?

37:47.854 --> 37:49.722
Kill the man that you think is Stahl?

37:49.756 --> 37:51.890
No, by doing things differently.

37:51.925 --> 37:55.461
And then failing and then
trying to do right again,

37:55.495 --> 37:57.496
until that becomes the new normal.

37:57.530 --> 37:59.598
I don't want a new normal.

37:59.632 --> 38:01.834
I want a crew that follows orders.

38:01.868 --> 38:04.770
I want to have cred in the streets

38:04.804 --> 38:07.106
so I can make them safe again.

38:07.140 --> 38:08.607
I don't want to start over.

38:08.641 --> 38:12.478
I want things back to the way they were.

38:14.781 --> 38:16.482
And I don't.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.454
You want a world

38:22.489 --> 38:26.859
where there's no place for men like me.

38:26.893 --> 38:29.165
And so do I.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.232
But it doesn't exist.

38:36.297 --> 38:37.903
I love you, Woz.

38:39.372 --> 38:41.306
I always will.

38:41.341 --> 38:42.941
There was a time
where I could honestly say

38:42.976 --> 38:46.891
that I would do anything for you.

38:49.682 --> 38:51.938
But cut me loose on this.

38:53.815 --> 38:55.654
I'll stand alone.

39:03.830 --> 39:06.799
<i>Hey, did you reach the DA?
Can she see us in the morning?</i>

39:06.833 --> 39:08.634
I don't think this can wait
until the morning.

39:08.668 --> 39:10.069
Why, what did Orlando tell you?

39:10.103 --> 39:11.303
Can you meet me at my office?

39:14.007 --> 39:15.240
Should I be worried?

39:15.275 --> 39:16.809
<i>I got hold of the DA.</i>

39:16.843 --> 39:18.243
<i>She's having drinks in the village,</i>

39:18.278 --> 39:19.511
but she'll meet us downtown.

39:19.546 --> 39:21.246
We're leaving my apartment now.

39:21.281 --> 39:22.848
I'm five minutes away. Wait for me.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.817
All right, I'll be right there.

40:38.491 --> 40:39.758
Shouldn't we wait for that cop lady?

40:39.792 --> 40:40.993
I'll just talk to her.

40:41.027 --> 40:42.628
She's on her way.

40:46.599 --> 40:48.967
<i>The next stop is 23rd Street.</i>

40:59.545 --> 41:01.413
<i>You reached James Nava. Leave a message.</i>

41:13.459 --> 41:15.494
NYPD. Run that light now.

41:37.304 --> 41:39.689
Miss, I need you to wait.

41:40.820 --> 41:41.787
Wait.

41:41.821 --> 41:42.988
He wasn't alone.

41:43.022 --> 41:44.690
Carjacking gone bad.

41:44.724 --> 41:47.071
Looks like they found the
assailant and...

41:47.860 --> 41:48.894
James.

41:48.928 --> 41:49.962
Easy. You can't touch him

41:49.996 --> 41:51.563
before the M.E. gets here.

41:51.597 --> 41:53.966
James.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.001
Baby. Baby.

41:56.035 --> 41:57.540
Please.

41:58.504 --> 41:59.571
- Please.
- He's dead.

41:59.605 --> 42:00.839
- Ma'am, he's gone.
- No!

42:00.873 --> 42:02.474
No!

42:02.508 --> 42:04.509
No! No!

42:04.544 --> 42:05.844
No! No!

42:07.914 --> 42:09.414
No.
