00:01.001 --> 00:07.339
[thunder booming]

00:07.465 --> 00:09.174
>> Oh it's coming
down now.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.135
Whoa!
I don't like this.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.219
>> Good grief.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.220
>> Should we move
that bench?

00:13.346 --> 00:14.805
>> It'll float away
if we don't.

00:14.931 --> 00:15.806
Jep: I bet you hundred
dollars you can't get

00:15.932 --> 00:17.850
up on this thing.

00:18.810 --> 00:19.268
Hey.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.186
Easy.
Easy.

00:21.312 --> 00:21.812
Easy.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.022
[splashing]

00:23.148 --> 00:23.647
>> You know what
I'm thinking, Jase?

00:23.773 --> 00:24.732
Jase: Huh?

00:24.858 --> 00:25.858
>> This is why
I left the river.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.694
>> Yeah, this is why
I headed North.

00:28.820 --> 00:29.862
Korie:
Where's Willie?

00:29.988 --> 00:30.612
>> Making a mail run.

00:30.739 --> 00:31.405
>> What?!

00:31.531 --> 00:32.948
>> Typical Willie.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.200
When the work starts out,
he's checking the mail.

00:35.326 --> 00:36.744
[whimsical music]
Willie: [exclaims]

00:36.870 --> 00:39.413
Going down the pants.
Going down the pants.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.789
>> There's nothing
more dangerous,

00:40.915 --> 00:44.835
or unpredictable,
than rising flood waters.

00:44.961 --> 00:47.796
I don't about grabbing this
during a lightening storm.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.466
Because Phil and Kay
live on the river,

00:50.592 --> 00:52.342
their house is in
constant danger

00:52.469 --> 00:54.178
of being flooded.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.221
Which is why we're
are here doing everything

00:56.347 --> 00:59.433
possible to keep that
from happening.

00:59.809 --> 01:00.809
This was always Willie,

01:00.935 --> 01:02.144
every time we
had a flood.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.645
We would all
be working....

01:03.772 --> 01:04.980
>> From the peripheral.

01:07.567 --> 01:11.528
>> Wait!
You lost a oar.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.363
Jase:
Well, except for Willie.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.365
Whose decided to put
all his efforts

01:15.492 --> 01:16.909
in retrieving the mail.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.495
>> Go it.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.287
>> Good job, babe.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.747
[grunting]

01:23.833 --> 01:25.709
>> Job well done.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.628
>> It's a little damp.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.796
>> All right, I'm headed
to higher ground.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.422
>> All right.
I think we got it all.

01:30.548 --> 01:31.590
>> Is that all of it?

01:31.716 --> 01:32.216
>> I can't wait to
see how important

01:32.342 --> 01:33.467
that mail is.

01:33.593 --> 21:16.849
>> It's a little wet.
It's a little wet.
