00:02.438 --> 00:04.571
I've been thinking about
what happened up there,

00:04.573 --> 00:06.406
that plane over D.C.

00:06.408 --> 00:09.143
UFOs. The symbol...

00:09.145 --> 00:11.545
I keep seeing this.

00:11.547 --> 00:13.280
Still are unanswered questions.

00:17.553 --> 00:19.119
You work for the Russians?

00:19.121 --> 00:22.188
You've been lying to all
of us this whole time.

00:22.190 --> 00:25.725
You've been spying on me, my family.

00:25.727 --> 00:27.627
Senator Kennedy is here to see you.

00:27.629 --> 00:29.029
Project Blue Book.

00:29.031 --> 00:30.329
- Senator.
- Senator.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.665
What can we do for you?

00:31.667 --> 00:33.667
Whatever you're working on,
I need you to put it down.

00:33.669 --> 00:36.302
We have a situation developing
in the North Atlantic.

- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

01:13.007 --> 01:14.239
Attention on deck.

01:16.811 --> 01:19.144
in preparation for heavy seas.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.051
_

01:26.053 --> 01:28.187
Ever heard of the Doomsday Clock?

01:28.189 --> 01:29.588
No. What's that?

01:30.791 --> 01:33.025
Scientists use it to calculate

01:33.027 --> 01:35.660
how close we are to
destroying ourselves.

01:35.662 --> 01:36.995
Oh, yeah?

01:36.997 --> 01:38.697
They just pushed it up this week.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.432
What's it at now?

01:43.436 --> 01:45.603
Two minutes to midnight.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.372
Midnight as in...

01:48.374 --> 01:50.474
They don't call it the
Doomsday Clock for nothing.

01:52.578 --> 01:54.511
Midnight? Ha!

01:54.513 --> 01:57.014
By my clock, it's already well past.

01:57.016 --> 01:59.316
That's weird.

01:59.318 --> 02:00.551
My watch stopped.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.620
We losing power?

02:02.622 --> 02:03.687
Do you see that?

02:05.658 --> 02:08.126
Is that the ghost ship?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.295
That was definitely it.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.564
No, I saw something else.

02:14.958 --> 02:16.033
There it is.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.402
Sir, you seeing this?

02:18.404 --> 02:20.604
Oh, my God. What is that?

02:23.709 --> 02:25.208
Russian?

02:25.210 --> 02:27.110
Forward batteries open fire.

02:27.112 --> 02:28.445
Forward batteries, engage.

02:28.447 --> 02:29.546
Engage.

02:29.548 --> 02:31.282
Oh, shit.

02:31.284 --> 02:33.450
It's gonna hit us!

02:33.452 --> 02:34.718
Retreat!

03:08.420 --> 03:09.452
The admiral on the ship

03:09.454 --> 03:11.321
classified it as Russian aircraft,

03:11.323 --> 03:14.357
but when I read the
official report, I...

03:14.359 --> 03:15.425
I had my doubts.

03:15.427 --> 03:17.627
- Then it's not one of ours.
- No.

03:17.629 --> 03:21.163
Now the Navy's acting
as if it never happened.

03:21.165 --> 03:22.888
Operation Mainbrace is gonna be

03:22.890 --> 03:24.919
the largest joint military exercise

03:24.921 --> 03:26.669
since World War I.

03:26.671 --> 03:29.271
Nine countries, 200 ships,

03:29.273 --> 03:31.741
80,000 men.

03:31.743 --> 03:35.277
All the more reason that
I should be fully informed,

03:35.279 --> 03:36.379
but I'm not.

03:36.381 --> 03:38.280
So what do you need from us, Senator?

03:39.617 --> 03:41.417
I want you to investigate this sighting

03:41.419 --> 03:42.618
as a UFO occurrence.

03:42.620 --> 03:43.686
I've already arranged

03:43.688 --> 03:45.221
to have you both flown out to the ship,

03:45.223 --> 03:47.357
assuming, of course,
that you're up for this.

03:47.359 --> 03:50.259
Well, we'd need to
inform the generals first.

03:50.261 --> 03:52.995
Don't worry about them.
I can take care of that.

03:52.997 --> 03:55.231
You just need to report back to me

03:55.233 --> 03:56.465
and only me

03:56.467 --> 03:59.869
about anything anomalous
you find out there.

03:59.871 --> 04:02.404
Is there something else going on

04:02.406 --> 04:04.773
that we should know about?

04:09.546 --> 04:11.881
I don't trust my Intel right now.

04:11.883 --> 04:14.216
Not since Fairchild's death.

04:14.218 --> 04:16.084
But he trusted you.

04:16.087 --> 04:18.172
He also thought when push came to shove,

04:18.173 --> 04:19.721
the military would do whatever it could

04:19.723 --> 04:21.790
to cover up the existence of UFOs,

04:21.791 --> 04:23.849
but anything unidentified

04:23.851 --> 04:27.008
in a war exercise this
close to Russian soil

04:27.010 --> 04:29.531
is very dangerous.

04:29.533 --> 04:31.867
So,

04:31.869 --> 04:33.502
I'll ask you once more.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.606
Are you up for this?

04:41.244 --> 04:43.578
Are you sure it's safe
where you're going?

04:43.580 --> 04:45.569
The entire NATO fleet's
out there right now.

04:45.571 --> 04:48.016
It might be the safest
place on the planet.

04:48.018 --> 04:51.319
What's that?

04:51.321 --> 04:55.123
My final statement to
the generals about Susie.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.925
You want me to drop
it off when I get back?

04:56.927 --> 04:59.461
They actually wanna talk
to me about it as well,

04:59.463 --> 05:02.731
I guess to, you know, wrap it all up.

05:02.733 --> 05:07.168
Well, hopefully then we
can put all this behind us.

05:08.705 --> 05:11.372
I already have.

05:12.842 --> 05:14.408
It's open.

05:18.414 --> 05:19.847
You finally cleaned up.

05:19.849 --> 05:21.816
Yeah, but I moved a few things around,

05:21.818 --> 05:24.418
and now I can never find my keys.

05:24.420 --> 05:26.487
Still in the door.

05:26.489 --> 05:27.588
You're a lifesaver.

05:31.561 --> 05:33.494
Dog tags? Those yours?

05:35.465 --> 05:37.644
Never used to wear 'em when
I traveled during the war.

05:38.901 --> 05:40.501
Figured it was bad luck,

05:40.503 --> 05:43.671
so I always just hooked 'em there.

05:43.673 --> 05:46.406
Anyway, come on. We're
running late as it is.

05:59.788 --> 06:01.420
That is absolutely...

06:01.422 --> 06:02.689
Terrifying.

06:28.783 --> 06:30.783
Sir, Dr. Hynek.

06:30.785 --> 06:32.585
The admiral's waiting
for you on the bridge.

06:32.587 --> 06:34.921
This way, please.

06:36.558 --> 06:38.356
Keelhaul recovery on the
fantail is now complete.

06:38.358 --> 06:42.394
Keelhaul recovery on the
fantail is now complete.

06:42.396 --> 06:44.720
Admiral, sir.

06:44.722 --> 06:45.962
The men from Project Blue Book.

06:49.770 --> 06:51.369
At ease.

06:51.371 --> 06:53.471
Captain Quinn, is it?

06:53.473 --> 06:55.874
That means you must be the
brains of the operation,

06:55.876 --> 06:58.476
- Dr. Hynek, yes?
- Uh, yes, sir.

06:58.478 --> 07:01.446
A special unit to
investigate flying saucers.

07:01.448 --> 07:02.915
Whose clever idea was that?

07:02.917 --> 07:04.883
The Air Force's, sir.

07:04.885 --> 07:07.485
That explains a lot now, doesn't it?

07:08.822 --> 07:10.956
Thank you for allowing us to board, sir.

07:10.958 --> 07:12.718
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Captain,

07:12.720 --> 07:16.061
but my men didn't see
any spaceships last night.

07:16.063 --> 07:18.140
I tried to make that
clear to the senator,

07:18.142 --> 07:20.065
but he insisted you still come out.

07:20.067 --> 07:22.633
So I did you the courtesy

07:22.635 --> 07:25.603
of compiling some witness statements.

07:25.605 --> 07:28.573
That way, no one's
wasting time out here.

07:28.575 --> 07:30.174
The Russians sure aren't.

07:30.176 --> 07:32.643
With all due respect, Admiral,

07:32.645 --> 07:33.911
Senator Kennedy sent us out

07:33.913 --> 07:36.513
to conduct our own investigation.

07:36.515 --> 07:39.684
My word not good enough
for you, Professor?

07:39.686 --> 07:43.654
Well, not unless you were an
actual eyewitness, Admiral,

07:43.656 --> 07:45.856
and we are under congressional orders.

07:45.858 --> 07:47.925
Isn't that funny? So am I.

07:49.729 --> 07:52.683
Master Chief Harris, let's
find our guests a room

07:52.685 --> 07:54.565
so they can interview our witnesses.

07:54.567 --> 07:57.568
That way, you can do your
job and I can do mine.

07:57.570 --> 07:58.903
Yes, sir.

07:58.905 --> 08:00.569
Anything else I can
do for you gentlemen?

08:00.571 --> 08:02.506
- No, sir.
- No, thank you, this is...

08:09.515 --> 08:12.182
He's convinced it was the Russians.

08:12.184 --> 08:13.750
I stole a look at his charts.

08:13.752 --> 08:15.152
The course he's mapped out?

08:17.123 --> 08:18.607
The admiral's bringing his fleet

08:18.609 --> 08:20.724
right to the edge of Soviet waters.

08:20.726 --> 08:24.228
200 warships, 80,000 men.

08:24.230 --> 08:25.496
It'll look like we're invading.

08:25.498 --> 08:27.764
I thought this was just
a training exercise.

08:27.766 --> 08:29.375
Yeah, out here, he can pretty much act

08:29.377 --> 08:30.900
under his own authority,

08:30.902 --> 08:32.669
especially if he feels threatened.

08:32.671 --> 08:35.539
So unless we can prove this
sighting was a real UFO...

08:35.541 --> 08:36.607
In a few hours.

08:36.609 --> 08:38.275
We may be going to war.

08:54.415 --> 08:56.315
Thank you for your honesty, Mrs. Hynek.

08:56.317 --> 08:58.050
We know this has been quite a process.

08:58.052 --> 09:00.886
What are you still
looking for at this point?

09:00.888 --> 09:02.811
I've told you everything I can remember

09:02.813 --> 09:03.921
at least five times.

09:03.923 --> 09:05.812
And I'm sorry we have to
keep putting you through it.

09:05.814 --> 09:06.925
I wish I could tell you more.

09:06.927 --> 09:08.411
I just don't know what else to do.

09:08.413 --> 09:10.562
Yeah, we might still
have something actually.

09:10.564 --> 09:12.580
You know, when Susie first came,

09:12.582 --> 09:15.597
she told us that she had
valuable intelligence for us,

09:15.599 --> 09:18.066
but she insisted she would only share it

09:18.068 --> 09:20.736
on one condition.

09:20.738 --> 09:22.604
She'd only tell it to you.

09:26.544 --> 09:27.632
What?

09:27.634 --> 09:30.111
We're actually hesitant
bringing it to your attention,

09:30.113 --> 09:31.413
but we have a situation developing

09:31.415 --> 09:33.048
in the North Atlantic right now.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.182
That's where Allen is.

09:34.184 --> 09:35.717
We realize that we're putting you

09:35.719 --> 09:37.385
in an uncomfortable position,

09:37.387 --> 09:40.135
but we're running out of options.

09:40.137 --> 09:42.405
And time.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.640
So what we're asking is

09:44.642 --> 09:46.376
would you be willing to talk to her,

09:46.378 --> 09:49.311
under our supervision, one on one?

09:53.517 --> 09:55.284
How long will I have?

09:55.286 --> 09:57.652
As much as you need.

09:57.654 --> 10:01.090
Unless she does something
that we don't like.

10:01.092 --> 10:03.325
Your safety is a priority here.

10:05.662 --> 10:07.329
I'd be more worried about her.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.834
Sir, I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:12.836 --> 10:15.070
I didn't see anything that night.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.571
Well...

10:16.573 --> 10:19.108
according to this
report, you were on deck

10:19.110 --> 10:21.543
during the sighting of the craft.

10:21.545 --> 10:22.878
Sir, may I go now?

10:24.481 --> 10:25.937
Well, if you do remember anything,

10:25.939 --> 10:27.516
we'll be right here.

10:27.518 --> 10:29.050
And we'll listen.

10:35.659 --> 10:37.225
You can send the next one in.

10:39.195 --> 10:40.495
Lying?

10:40.497 --> 10:42.464
Usually people lie about what they see,

10:42.466 --> 10:44.433
not what they don't.

10:44.435 --> 10:47.335
There's something else going on here.

10:47.337 --> 10:50.439
Sir? Permission to enter, sir?

10:50.441 --> 10:52.941
Permission granted.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.242
- Sir.
- Sir.

10:54.244 --> 10:55.343
- Sir.
- Sir.

10:55.345 --> 10:56.377
I really have no idea...

10:56.379 --> 10:57.579
What you're talking about.

10:57.581 --> 11:01.483
- Sure, I was there...
- But I didn't see anything.

11:01.485 --> 11:03.551
Then why give a statement
in the first place?

11:06.288 --> 11:09.356
Sir, I'd take it back if I could.

11:09.358 --> 11:11.391
Because I don't wanna end up like them.

11:15.130 --> 11:17.331
End up like who? What
are you talking about?

11:19.401 --> 11:21.401
Gerald?

11:21.403 --> 11:23.136
No one.

11:24.474 --> 11:27.040
Sir, are we done?

11:27.042 --> 11:28.442
No. No, we're not.

11:32.615 --> 11:34.281
Look, I understand.

11:34.283 --> 11:36.316
Yeah, you don't wanna get yourself

11:36.318 --> 11:38.084
or anyone else in trouble.

11:38.086 --> 11:40.820
So don't talk.

11:40.822 --> 11:42.789
Just point to someone who's willing to

11:42.791 --> 11:45.124
and we'll take it from there.

11:48.497 --> 11:49.596
You're off the hook.

11:55.537 --> 11:56.603
Sir, they're not on there.

11:56.605 --> 11:58.270
- Can you double check?
- I did.

12:01.643 --> 12:03.476
Sir, I have a post I need to stand,

12:03.478 --> 12:04.811
and you've heard my statement.

12:04.813 --> 12:06.846
Permission to be excused, sir.

12:06.848 --> 12:08.347
Permission granted.

12:16.891 --> 12:19.558
He's terrified. They all are.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.649
You know, it's almost as if

12:20.651 --> 12:22.971
the high-ranking commanding
officer who steers this ship

12:22.973 --> 12:24.062
told them all what to say.

12:24.064 --> 12:26.231
And why give us only a
partial list of witness names

12:26.233 --> 12:29.367
if he's scared them
all into keeping quiet?

12:29.369 --> 12:31.169
'Cause maybe the ones
who aren't on the list

12:31.171 --> 12:32.671
insisted on telling the
truth the first time.

12:32.673 --> 12:34.172
Disobeying an order from the admiral

12:34.174 --> 12:35.841
would land you in the brig, yes?

12:35.843 --> 12:38.443
Not if you're a higher ranking officer.

12:38.445 --> 12:40.646
Come on.

12:51.491 --> 12:52.857
Sir.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.759
We're here to interview those men.

12:54.761 --> 12:56.417
I can't let you in there, sir.

12:56.419 --> 12:57.444
I have orders.

12:57.446 --> 12:58.863
Well, the admiral ordered us

12:58.865 --> 13:01.966
to interview all witnesses on this ship.

13:01.968 --> 13:04.902
Are you saying you'll
disobey that order?

13:04.904 --> 13:07.805
- No, sir.
- Then step aside.

13:13.046 --> 13:15.813
Commander. Lieutenant.

13:15.815 --> 13:17.782
I'm Captain Michael Quinn.
This is Dr. Allen Hynek.

13:17.784 --> 13:19.835
- U.S. Air Force.
- Project Blue Book.

13:19.837 --> 13:22.852
We investigate UFOs,
unidentified flying objects,

13:22.854 --> 13:24.421
and we've come all the way from Ohio

13:24.423 --> 13:25.855
just to hear your story.

13:25.857 --> 13:27.224
You were there in D.C., right?

13:27.226 --> 13:29.359
- Those lights over the Capital?
- That's right.

13:29.361 --> 13:31.395
And we heard you have
an even better story.

13:31.397 --> 13:32.729
In fact, it made it all the way back

13:32.731 --> 13:34.698
- to Senator Kennedy.
- What did he hear?

13:34.700 --> 13:36.833
Sir.

13:36.835 --> 13:38.635
We'll say whatever you want.

13:38.637 --> 13:41.238
Just let us know what you need to hear.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.640
Well, that's easy. Just the truth.

13:47.413 --> 13:50.514
Now, the reason you're here under guard

13:50.516 --> 13:51.748
is that you tried telling the admiral

13:51.750 --> 13:52.849
what you really saw.

13:52.851 --> 13:54.317
He told you to lie, right?

13:57.922 --> 14:00.022
Nobody'll talk about it now,

14:00.024 --> 14:01.491
but strange stuff has been going on

14:01.493 --> 14:02.658
since we got out here.

14:02.660 --> 14:03.692
Equipment malfunctioning,

14:03.694 --> 14:05.528
pilots seeing strange
lights in the skies...

14:05.530 --> 14:08.231
And the ghost ship.

14:08.233 --> 14:09.432
Ghost ship?

14:09.434 --> 14:11.267
There's this boat that's
shown up out of nowhere

14:11.269 --> 14:12.368
a couple times.

14:12.370 --> 14:13.736
Fishing trawler.

14:13.738 --> 14:15.671
It'd be there one
second and gone the next.

14:15.673 --> 14:18.007
This is a different thing
to the craft in the sky, yes?

14:18.009 --> 14:20.709
Yes, sir. That would come after.

14:20.711 --> 14:22.911
And you told the admiral
what you just told us?

14:22.913 --> 14:24.614
Sir, he insisted it was Russia.

14:24.616 --> 14:27.082
Told us to keep our mouths shut
or we'd never get out of here.

14:27.084 --> 14:28.850
But we had a little insurance policy

14:28.852 --> 14:30.918
on the deck with us that night.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.687
It's gotta still be up there

14:32.689 --> 14:34.122
where we hid it.

14:46.002 --> 14:47.735
Clear.

14:58.715 --> 15:00.281
A camera?

15:00.283 --> 15:01.816
There's gotta be a lab on board.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.350
Let's go.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.327
Just a few more seconds, Captain.

15:50.398 --> 15:52.786
Go in there and speak freely.

15:52.788 --> 15:54.178
We'll be right here behind you.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.286
We need to alert Senator Kennedy.

16:16.924 --> 16:19.725
Someone needs to shut
down this entire operation.

16:21.328 --> 16:24.396
We got a bigger problem than that, Doc.

16:24.398 --> 16:28.000
Whatever that thing is,
it's still out there.

16:33.746 --> 16:37.281
One of my men took this?

16:37.283 --> 16:38.745
Sir, this print shows a craft

16:38.747 --> 16:40.638
with no wings, no
obvious source of thrust,

16:40.640 --> 16:42.607
emerging from the ocean.

16:42.609 --> 16:45.276
What these men saw was
real. This is proof.

16:47.114 --> 16:48.413
You're right.

16:50.184 --> 16:52.951
The Russians clearly have
a tactical advantage here,

16:52.953 --> 16:53.985
and unless I move swiftly,

16:53.987 --> 16:55.453
there's no telling
what they might do next.

16:55.455 --> 16:56.478
What? No.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.244
No, the Russians don't have
this kind of capability.

16:58.246 --> 16:59.619
- Nobody does.
- Sir, Admiral, sir.

16:59.621 --> 17:01.921
We have a situation.
Unidentified craft approaching.

17:01.923 --> 17:03.813
- What is it? What's its position?
- I don't know, sir.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.425
It just appeared out of nowhere.
Half a mile ahead.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.079
All stop.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.476
- All stop.
- All stop by.

17:23.478 --> 17:25.243
We've got a vessel
in distress out there.

17:25.246 --> 17:26.512
Let's prepare to board her.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.515
Alert the rest of the fleet.

17:29.517 --> 17:32.284
I want a fully armed
boarding party on standby.

17:32.286 --> 17:33.819
Let's go. Let's go!

17:33.821 --> 17:36.489
- Yes, sir.
- All fleet stand by.

17:39.260 --> 17:42.327
What is it? What do you see?

17:42.329 --> 17:43.995
The ghost ship.

17:43.997 --> 17:45.163
Which means...

17:45.165 --> 17:46.964
The triangle craft should come next.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.347
It's nice to see you, Mimi.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.732
You told the generals
you had something for me?

18:25.404 --> 18:27.538
Is that the only reason you're here?

18:27.540 --> 18:30.107
What other reason would there be?

18:35.414 --> 18:37.848
Mimi, I'm sorry.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.318
I don't expect you to forgive me...

18:41.320 --> 18:42.419
I don't.

18:42.421 --> 18:43.711
But maybe someday you
will understand why.

18:43.713 --> 18:46.423
You almost got me killed.

18:46.425 --> 18:49.759
Allen, our son.

18:49.761 --> 18:52.228
What am I supposed to understand?

18:56.068 --> 18:59.569
That in some ways, you
and I are very much alike.

18:59.571 --> 19:02.005
We are nothing alike.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.212
I asked for you

19:09.214 --> 19:12.048
because you are the only person I trust

19:12.050 --> 19:13.883
to deliver my message safely.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.159
This is the name and address

19:24.161 --> 19:27.429
of the highest ranking
operative of ours in Ohio.

19:27.431 --> 19:29.098
She knows all about Blue Book

19:29.100 --> 19:31.266
as well as Russian counterintelligence.

19:33.437 --> 19:35.503
She is who the generals are looking for.

19:38.642 --> 19:40.285
This is everything I swore to protect

19:40.287 --> 19:42.010
my entire life, Mimi.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.920
And now I'm giving it to you,

19:51.922 --> 19:54.022
and when I do, my life will be over.

19:55.726 --> 19:58.359
You can at least
understand that, can't you?

20:01.765 --> 20:04.598
So that's why you brought me here?

20:04.600 --> 20:06.567
Just to tell me that?

20:12.108 --> 20:13.374
Hey, hey, hey. Let her go.

20:13.376 --> 20:14.742
Let her go!

20:14.744 --> 20:16.177
I was never gonna hurt you, Mimi.

20:16.179 --> 20:18.015
- Get her out of here!
- I killed Cal to protect you.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.097
- That's what you meant to me.
- Get her out of here.

20:27.857 --> 20:29.723
What, do you see something, Al?

20:29.725 --> 20:31.625
The markings on that vessel.

20:31.627 --> 20:33.960
Take a look. It's
registered in Shanghai.

20:33.962 --> 20:37.397
Yes, by sea, that's
11,000 miles from here.

20:40.959 --> 20:42.281
Sir.

20:42.283 --> 20:43.973
Boat is empty. Not a soul on board.

20:43.975 --> 20:45.097
All right.

20:45.099 --> 20:46.727
That abandoned boat's
a hazard for other ships

20:46.729 --> 20:48.275
passing through the area.

20:48.277 --> 20:50.243
Put a demo crew
together. I want it sunk.

20:50.245 --> 20:51.711
- What?
- Yes, sir.

20:51.713 --> 20:53.280
Why would you do that?

20:53.282 --> 20:55.048
Where are we at with our chopper?

20:55.050 --> 20:57.284
Sir, the weather's forecast
to clear in the next few hours.

20:57.286 --> 20:59.152
The second it does, I
want them off my ship.

20:59.154 --> 21:00.954
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

21:02.757 --> 21:04.324
What the hell was that?

21:04.326 --> 21:06.325
We need to get on that trawler.

21:06.327 --> 21:08.694
Appeared out of nowhere,
like the lieutenant said,

21:08.696 --> 21:10.562
right before the black triangle came?

21:10.564 --> 21:11.763
I wanna know why,

21:11.765 --> 21:13.199
and that means we need to get on board.

21:13.201 --> 21:14.800
Oh well, I'm sure if we
ask the admiral nicely,

21:14.802 --> 21:16.101
he'll let us do whatever we want.

21:16.103 --> 21:17.325
Captain, he didn't believe the photo,

21:17.327 --> 21:18.483
but if there's evidence on that boat

21:18.485 --> 21:19.604
to prove our case...

21:22.409 --> 21:25.144
You realize I'd be
risking a court martial?

21:25.146 --> 21:26.478
As opposed to World War III?

21:36.758 --> 21:38.790
They're gonna figure out
we're here pretty quickly.

21:38.792 --> 21:40.392
I'd say we have ten minutes.

21:40.394 --> 21:41.693
Or worse, they don't

21:41.695 --> 21:43.562
and blow this boat up with us on it.

21:52.706 --> 21:54.373
This way.

22:04.551 --> 22:06.485
I think they're on to us, Doc.

22:11.725 --> 22:14.392
Fuel tank's nearly full.

22:14.394 --> 22:16.727
This says there were six souls aboard

22:16.729 --> 22:19.663
when they left Shanghai.

22:19.665 --> 22:22.633
Look at that date.

22:22.635 --> 22:25.904
Two days ago.

22:25.906 --> 22:28.373
There's no way this boat
traveled over 10,000 miles

22:28.375 --> 22:31.342
in two days and still
have a full tank of fuel.

22:31.344 --> 22:33.511
Yeah. It's impossible.

22:38.178 --> 22:41.035
Am I seeing things?

22:41.037 --> 22:42.653
What is that, melted wood?

22:42.655 --> 22:44.822
It's not melted.

22:44.824 --> 22:46.791
Fused.

22:46.793 --> 22:50.461
Like the wheel's somehow being absorbed

22:50.463 --> 22:51.595
back into the boat.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.767
All the glass is fused too.

22:56.769 --> 22:58.569
You hear that?

23:01.541 --> 23:02.606
What is that?

23:30.135 --> 23:32.335
I don't understand.

23:32.337 --> 23:33.537
You say I'm where?

23:33.539 --> 23:37.140
In the North Atlantic near Norway.

23:37.142 --> 23:39.075
No.

23:39.077 --> 23:40.610
That's not possible.

23:40.612 --> 23:43.112
Ship's log says there
was a crew on board.

23:43.114 --> 23:44.280
Where are they?

23:44.282 --> 23:46.348
They took the lifeboat.

23:46.350 --> 23:48.350
I stayed with the ship.

23:48.352 --> 23:50.419
That's what a captain does.

23:50.421 --> 23:52.721
And what's your name, Captain?

23:52.723 --> 23:53.856
Turi.

23:53.858 --> 23:57.470
Turi.

23:57.472 --> 23:59.762
Well, Turi, we got a U.S. Naval fleet

23:59.764 --> 24:01.296
that thinks you're a Russian asset.

24:01.298 --> 24:02.364
Now, they're on their way

24:02.366 --> 24:04.168
to apprehend all of us as we speak,

24:04.170 --> 24:07.903
so we're gonna need to explain
how the hell you ended up here.

24:07.905 --> 24:10.238
We were fishing,

24:10.240 --> 24:11.840
setting up the nets,

24:11.842 --> 24:14.176
and suddenly, the power...

24:17.848 --> 24:19.949
Then we see this light.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.354
Coming from under the boat.

24:26.356 --> 24:29.757
A craft of some sort.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.593
This craft, what did it look like?

24:35.832 --> 24:37.065
Triangle.

24:39.136 --> 24:41.436
And it came up from under the water?

24:41.438 --> 24:45.154
Fishermen, they all told the stories

24:45.156 --> 24:46.692
of the cities under the sea.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.943
What do you mean, cities?

24:48.945 --> 24:51.846
Where the triangle come from.

24:51.848 --> 24:54.249
Been here for thousands of years.

24:54.251 --> 24:57.252
You're sure that this is what you saw?

24:57.254 --> 24:58.853
I would bet my life on it.

25:00.356 --> 25:02.757
We are not alone.

25:02.759 --> 25:06.293
Unidentified vessel,
prepare to be boarded!

26:02.084 --> 26:03.716
I left something in Joel's room.

26:03.718 --> 26:04.951
Hey, hey, hey. Let her go.

26:04.953 --> 26:06.152
Let her go!

26:46.527 --> 26:48.060
Yes?

26:48.062 --> 26:49.361
Um...

26:49.363 --> 26:53.165
This is the address...

26:53.167 --> 26:55.101
on the letter from Lena?

27:02.276 --> 27:04.409
Who are you?

27:04.411 --> 27:08.214
She wanted me to deliver this

27:08.216 --> 27:10.082
to her.

27:15.421 --> 27:16.600
I'm sorry.

27:18.527 --> 27:20.217
Is Mommy here?

27:31.037 --> 27:33.506
Take good care of her, okay?

27:35.520 --> 27:37.310
Pull the destroyers into position

27:37.312 --> 27:38.556
and put them on high alert,

27:38.558 --> 27:39.957
and I want the frigates moved here

27:39.959 --> 27:41.991
to make room for the
carriers by nightfall.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.115
Aye, aye, admiral.

27:44.117 --> 27:47.118
Admiral, sir.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.352
You said bring them to you first.

27:49.354 --> 27:52.555
Yes. Thank you, Master Chief.

27:52.557 --> 27:55.025
Gentlemen, come here. I
want to show you something.

27:56.924 --> 27:58.113
In the past eight hours,

27:58.115 --> 27:59.471
we've picked up Russian submarines

27:59.473 --> 28:01.925
here, here, and here.

28:01.927 --> 28:03.316
The entire carrier fleet

28:03.318 --> 28:04.632
is already moved into open water.

28:04.634 --> 28:06.170
They're preparing for war.

28:06.172 --> 28:08.604
And in the middle of this,
I've had to stop this ship

28:08.606 --> 28:10.008
and send men out to bring you back

28:10.010 --> 28:11.163
because you disobeyed an order.

28:11.165 --> 28:12.364
Sir, our orders are
from Senator Kennedy.

28:12.366 --> 28:13.632
And there was still a
fisherman on that boat.

28:13.634 --> 28:14.900
We have the authority
to act on our own accord.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.125
He saw the triangle craft,
and it wasn't Russian!

28:16.127 --> 28:18.870
You said a fisherman
said it wasn't Russian?

28:18.872 --> 28:20.039
Oh, I see.

28:20.041 --> 28:22.507
So in your eyes, his word means more

28:22.509 --> 28:23.556
than the admiral of this ship?

28:23.558 --> 28:25.276
Sir, there was more
evidence onboard that ship

28:25.278 --> 28:26.310
that we cannot explain.

28:26.312 --> 28:28.312
That you couldn't explain?

28:28.314 --> 28:31.182
Try explaining to the
president of the United States

28:31.184 --> 28:33.617
why you let Russia sink
an entire NATO fleet

28:33.619 --> 28:35.520
and fire a first strike on the mainland

28:35.522 --> 28:38.383
because a couple of insolent
Air Force idiots showed up

28:38.385 --> 28:40.027
and tried to convince
you that it was aliens

28:40.029 --> 28:41.325
flying around your ship

28:41.327 --> 28:42.886
and not the Communist superpower

28:42.888 --> 28:44.562
that has publicly vowed to destroy you!

28:44.564 --> 28:46.730
So now, I'm gonna throw you in the brig

28:46.732 --> 28:47.998
and ask you give thanks

28:48.000 --> 28:50.534
for my having mercy on your sorry asses.

28:50.536 --> 28:52.369
Now get off my bridge!

28:57.777 --> 28:59.509
All ahead full.

28:59.511 --> 29:00.611
All ahead full.

29:00.613 --> 29:01.838
All ahead full.

29:03.549 --> 29:04.582
All ahead full.

29:06.385 --> 29:08.956
When Kennedy doesn't hear
from us, he'll reach out.

29:08.958 --> 29:10.798
- He'll help.
- It'll be too late by then, Doc.

29:16.896 --> 29:18.696
What was that?

29:22.901 --> 29:24.400
Captain.

29:24.402 --> 29:25.935
That's coming from below.

29:27.973 --> 29:29.872
Battle stations!

29:29.874 --> 29:32.341
Battle stations!

29:32.343 --> 29:34.510
Battle stations!

29:35.680 --> 29:37.614
Hey, Doc. Come on.

29:40.485 --> 29:42.284
Which way?

29:45.790 --> 29:47.857
Doc, over here.

29:47.859 --> 29:49.158
Is it the Russians?

29:57.034 --> 29:58.366
There!

30:22.798 --> 30:24.264
What's it doing?

30:31.310 --> 30:32.765
What did we just see out there?

30:36.738 --> 30:38.104
Sir, we've got multiple targets

30:38.106 --> 30:39.806
moving faster than any known submarine.

30:39.808 --> 30:40.873
Where the hell are they?

30:40.875 --> 30:42.208
300 feet down.

30:42.210 --> 30:43.599
Looks like they're
nearing some sort of...

30:43.601 --> 30:44.844
Some sort of what?

30:44.846 --> 30:46.045
I don't know, sir.

30:46.047 --> 30:48.715
Maybe...

30:48.717 --> 30:50.282
What just happened?

30:50.284 --> 30:51.784
I'm not sure.

30:51.786 --> 30:53.753
They could've disappeared
into some sort of structure,

30:53.755 --> 30:56.222
but all the charts we have
don't show anything down there.

30:56.224 --> 30:58.224
Whatever that thing is,
if we can read it on radar,

30:58.226 --> 31:00.860
our depth charges can find it too.

31:00.862 --> 31:02.929
We have to take matters
into our own hands now.

31:02.931 --> 31:04.030
Where are we going?

31:04.032 --> 31:06.799
How do you stop someone from
making a horrible mistake?

31:06.801 --> 31:07.962
You make the choice for them.

31:13.107 --> 31:14.172
What are we doing here?

31:14.174 --> 31:15.441
I'm going after those things.

31:15.443 --> 31:16.908
Hold on, you're what?

31:16.910 --> 31:18.043
400 feet down.

31:18.045 --> 31:19.278
This sub is capable of that.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.447
I can ID whatever's below, radio backup.

31:21.449 --> 31:22.948
Once I'm inside, you'll
need to open the hatch

31:22.950 --> 31:24.683
that lets me out.

31:24.685 --> 31:25.884
That's the switch right there.

31:25.886 --> 31:27.742
- I'm not doing that.
- Yes, you are.

31:27.744 --> 31:28.833
No, I'm not!

31:28.835 --> 31:30.225
Doc, if the admiral
thinks I'm down there,

31:30.227 --> 31:31.349
he won't launch an attack.

31:31.351 --> 31:32.840
But what if whatever's
down there is hostile?

31:32.842 --> 31:34.756
What if it is the Russians
and I made a mistake?

31:34.758 --> 31:35.958
Is that what you really think?

31:38.232 --> 31:39.431
Neither do I.

31:41.034 --> 31:42.934
Do you even know how
to pilot a submarine?

31:42.936 --> 31:44.637
Had some basic training once.

31:44.639 --> 31:46.238
Yeah, well Mimi showed me
how to make pancakes once,

31:46.240 --> 31:48.506
but I couldn't flip one now
if you gave me a snow shovel.

31:50.244 --> 31:52.450
I don't know that I can do this.

31:52.452 --> 31:53.652
Doc.

31:53.654 --> 31:55.854
I came so close in D.C.

31:55.856 --> 31:57.989
If there really is something
from another world down there,

31:57.991 --> 31:59.423
I wanna see what it is.

32:02.829 --> 32:04.328
This is why we do this.

32:11.504 --> 32:12.737
Okay.

32:14.664 --> 32:15.740
Be careful.

32:17.443 --> 32:19.483
Careful would've been
staying at home to begin with.

32:20.714 --> 32:22.513
I'm doing what needs to be done.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.686
Good luck.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.714
Depth charges, Hedgehogs, torpedoes.

32:47.716 --> 32:49.286
We'll throw everything we've got at 'em.

32:49.288 --> 32:50.874
Admiral, you can't fire now.
The captain's down there.

32:50.876 --> 32:52.032
- You'll kill him.
- He's what?

32:52.034 --> 32:53.578
Captain Quinn's deployed
himself into a submarine.

32:53.580 --> 32:54.845
He's heading after those things.

32:54.847 --> 32:56.646
- You're not serious.
- Oh, yes, I am.

32:56.648 --> 32:58.848
- Check your gauges.
- Sir, we're in range and ready to fire.

32:58.850 --> 33:00.750
Then he's put himself in harm's way.

33:00.752 --> 33:01.784
Don't you dare.

33:01.786 --> 33:03.653
I will not risk the
lives of all of my men

33:03.655 --> 33:04.854
for one of yours.

33:34.819 --> 33:35.852
Oh, my God.

33:40.424 --> 33:41.490
"USS Wisconsin",

33:41.492 --> 33:43.092
if you can hear me, don't attack.

33:43.094 --> 33:45.042
I'm nearing the sight. Don't attack.

33:45.044 --> 33:47.797
It's not a cave, it's...

33:47.799 --> 33:49.966
something else.

33:49.968 --> 33:52.012
It's beautiful.

33:52.014 --> 33:53.569
Admiral, you can't do this.

33:53.571 --> 33:56.572
I didn't do this. You did.

33:56.574 --> 33:59.475
My responsibility is to the fleet.

33:59.477 --> 34:01.077
No, please! No, you can't do this.

34:01.079 --> 34:03.044
- You'll kill him!
- Get out of my way!

34:03.046 --> 34:04.246
Fire at will!

34:04.248 --> 34:05.748
Fire! Fire!

34:05.750 --> 34:07.249
Admiral, no! You're making a mistake!

34:10.487 --> 34:11.587
- Depth charges away.
- No!

34:23.534 --> 34:26.067
Charges away.

34:26.069 --> 34:27.101
Depth charges away.

34:38.947 --> 34:40.014
Admiral, no!

34:41.784 --> 34:43.150
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

34:45.154 --> 34:47.522
Shit.

34:50.607 --> 34:55.206
_

35:29.547 --> 35:31.013
What's it say?

35:31.015 --> 35:33.149
The events will be officially ruled

35:33.151 --> 35:36.618
as humpback whales diving
above and beneath the seawater,

35:36.620 --> 35:38.988
feeding on bioluminescent plankton.

35:38.990 --> 35:40.289
It's done.

35:40.291 --> 35:42.524
Yeah.

35:42.526 --> 35:44.293
For now.

35:46.630 --> 35:48.764
He didn't have any family

35:48.766 --> 35:51.133
that I could forward these on to.

35:58.106 --> 35:59.706
I'm, uh...

36:01.442 --> 36:04.043
I'm gonna recommend him
for the Medal of Honor.

36:07.147 --> 36:10.048
I think that's the only
right thing to do, Jim.

36:46.319 --> 36:47.752
The ghost ship.

36:47.754 --> 36:50.155
It'd be there one second
and gone the next.

36:53.660 --> 36:55.660
The cities under the sea.

36:58.731 --> 37:00.131
But what if whatever's
down there is hostile?

37:00.133 --> 37:02.400
What if it is the Russians,
and I made a mistake?

37:02.402 --> 37:04.101
Is that what you really think?

37:07.174 --> 37:09.106
Allen?

37:09.108 --> 37:12.076
This is why we do this.

37:12.078 --> 37:14.245
Allen.

37:14.247 --> 37:16.147
You need to come to bed.

37:16.149 --> 37:19.016
It's 2:00 a.m. You
haven't slept in days.

37:19.018 --> 37:20.484
No, no, no. Look at this.

37:20.486 --> 37:22.053
One man missing, two left alive,

37:22.055 --> 37:24.388
traveling 3,700 miles in three days.

37:24.390 --> 37:26.157
Two... two people
missing, one left alive,

37:26.159 --> 37:28.527
- traveling 3,000 miles in two days...
- Allen.

37:28.529 --> 37:29.718
It's just like the ghost ship.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.128
You need to let this go.

37:34.133 --> 37:35.833
Allen.

37:35.835 --> 37:37.034
Allen.

37:39.405 --> 37:41.138
You have to let him go.

38:34.825 --> 38:37.559
It's not a cave; it's something else.

38:37.561 --> 38:39.128
It's beautiful.

39:07.323 --> 39:08.455
This can't be.

39:16.132 --> 39:17.231
Can't be.

39:21.504 --> 39:22.970
Oh, my God.

40:47.087 --> 40:49.921
I can't say I'm surprised
you found me, Doctor.

40:49.923 --> 40:53.157
It is, after all, the logical choice.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.393
Tierra Del Fuego.

40:56.497 --> 40:59.531
Last stop on land before Antarctica.

40:59.533 --> 41:01.566
What does surprise me

41:01.568 --> 41:03.502
is that you accepted my invitation.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.537
Well, I didn't.

41:05.539 --> 41:07.438
In fact, you are the
last person on Earth

41:07.440 --> 41:08.539
I wanna see right now.

41:10.576 --> 41:12.510
Then why are you here?

41:12.512 --> 41:15.245
I need help finding someone.

41:15.247 --> 41:18.716
Something tells me I'm
looking at the only person

41:18.718 --> 41:20.284
who may actually be able to do that.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.353
Who are you searching for?

41:36.101 --> 41:37.468
What just happened?

41:37.470 --> 41:38.936
What happened?

41:38.938 --> 41:40.440
It appears that all our depth charges

41:40.442 --> 41:41.965
have been neutralized somehow, sir.

41:41.967 --> 41:43.607
And Quinn?

41:43.609 --> 41:44.707
Where's the submarine?

41:48.780 --> 41:50.613
Captain.

41:50.615 --> 41:52.615
Quinn, do you read me?

41:52.617 --> 41:54.584
Quinn, do you read?

41:54.586 --> 41:56.987
Captain.

41:56.989 --> 41:59.622
Then what happened, to the submarine

41:59.624 --> 42:01.258
and to the captain?

42:07.366 --> 42:09.299
I don't understand.

42:09.301 --> 42:12.402
How could everything
down there just vanish?

42:19.445 --> 42:20.610
Doctor?

42:29.521 --> 42:31.187
He found them.

42:33.124 --> 42:37.426
And now it's time to find Quinn.

42:54.612 --> 42:56.412
Three, one, five, four,

42:56.414 --> 43:00.516
five, six, five, three, nine.
