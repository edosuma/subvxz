00:55.630 --> 00:58.027
- My father
always used to say to me,

00:58.027 --> 01:01.850
"Son, you only come this way once.

01:01.850 --> 01:05.233
See the world, tell people what you saw.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.240
Leave your mark,

01:08.240 --> 01:12.210
interpret the human
experience through your lens."

01:12.210 --> 01:16.190
So how did I end up here?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.130
Good morning, James Hayes.

01:42.130 --> 01:43.080
How may I help you?

01:44.060 --> 01:44.893
Hey, Teresa.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.940
He's downstairs to see me now?

01:50.079 --> 01:51.493
Did he say he had an appointment?

01:53.390 --> 01:54.223
Okay.

01:54.223 --> 01:56.010
I gotta stop and get his loss report,

01:56.010 --> 01:58.220
but tell him I'll be down
there in just a few minutes.

01:58.220 --> 01:59.053
Yeah. Thank you.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.193
- Look at that.

02:06.110 --> 02:07.460
- That's it?

02:07.460 --> 02:08.720
- What do you mean "That's it?"

02:08.720 --> 02:11.120
My car didn't look like that before.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.840
- Did you say your wife was
injured in this accident?

02:12.840 --> 02:14.053
- Yeah, and?

02:14.980 --> 02:16.830
- How could anyone
possibly have been injured?

02:16.830 --> 02:18.590
I mean, the bumper's barely scratched.

02:18.590 --> 02:20.480
- All I know is after the accident,

02:20.480 --> 02:21.750
my wife's neck started hurting.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.090
So we went to the hospital

02:23.090 --> 02:24.710
and they gave her a cervical collar

02:24.710 --> 02:27.030
and a prescription for medicine.

02:27.030 --> 02:29.440
We're supposed to follow
up with her doctor.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.370
That's what we're gonna do

02:31.370 --> 02:33.423
and your company's gonna pay for it.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.757
- Let's go inside, Mr. Frowd.

02:55.410 --> 02:56.343
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.080
You know, sometimes when
I'm driving to work,

03:02.080 --> 03:03.993
I wonder how the hell did I get here?

03:05.878 --> 03:06.870
You get paid just enough

03:06.870 --> 03:09.550
to create a lifestyle you wanna maintain,

03:09.550 --> 03:10.890
but you'll never make enough money

03:10.890 --> 03:13.430
to be as comfortable as you like.

03:13.430 --> 03:16.370
- At least you have a
job, your bills get paid.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.290
What's the big deal?

03:17.290 --> 03:20.470
- The big deal is we give away
the best years of our life

03:20.470 --> 03:22.830
and energy to a place we
don't really wanna be.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.670
- Every morning when I come in,

03:24.670 --> 03:26.000
I see you working on something

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
that is clearly non-insurance related

03:28.000 --> 03:30.500
on company time using company equipment

03:30.500 --> 03:32.460
and it's not costing you a thing.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.670
- I spend 40 to 45 minutes a day writing.

03:34.670 --> 03:35.640
The rest of my day

03:35.640 --> 03:37.270
is spent listening to people lie to me

03:37.270 --> 03:39.530
and they don't even have
the decency to do it well.

03:39.530 --> 03:41.170
- Speaking of lying and deceiving,

03:41.170 --> 03:42.003
what do you think about that nonsense

03:42.003 --> 03:43.830
they're trying to pull with the raises?

03:43.830 --> 03:45.760
- You mean the raises we're
not getting this year?

03:45.760 --> 03:48.120
- It's because our
expenses are really high.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.480
- Oh, come on, Angela.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.600
The company's losing money

03:50.600 --> 03:52.636
because of consistently poor decisions.

03:52.636 --> 03:53.830
- That's not it.

03:53.830 --> 03:55.770
- Obviously you've been
drinking the Kool-Aid.

03:55.770 --> 03:58.350
- No, I just read the annual report.

03:58.350 --> 03:59.840
- You know, two months ago they tell us

03:59.840 --> 04:02.270
we're not getting the raises
that we deserve this year,

04:02.270 --> 04:05.950
only to tell us last week that
they're spending $75 million

04:05.950 --> 04:08.170
on a brand new hockey arena in a town

04:08.170 --> 04:09.330
that doesn't have a hockey team

04:09.330 --> 04:10.173
and never had one.
- Yeah, but it's not like

04:10.173 --> 04:12.580
they're gonna write a
check out for 75 million.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.033
- I mean, do they think
that we can't figure out

04:14.033 --> 04:16.130
that we're not getting
the raises this year

04:16.130 --> 04:18.980
because they're spending
money on unnecessary bullshit?

04:18.980 --> 04:20.800
- You have options.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.820
- Yeah, so Angela,

04:22.820 --> 04:24.513
since you've got those hooker heels on,

04:24.513 --> 04:25.346
why don't you to come over here

04:25.346 --> 04:27.010
and give me a quick lap dance?

04:27.010 --> 04:29.829
- Grow some equipment
and I'll think about it.

04:29.829 --> 04:30.662
- You know what?

04:30.662 --> 04:31.670
Why don't you just give him some?

04:31.670 --> 04:33.680
Maybe he'll leave you alone.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.990
- He wouldn't know what to do

04:34.990 --> 04:37.508
if he had printed instructions.

04:39.326 --> 04:40.750
- She wishes I needed
printed instructions.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.090
- Hello?

04:42.090 --> 04:43.850
Hey, what's up?

04:43.850 --> 04:45.750
Oh, I know. It was awesome, wasn't it?

04:47.730 --> 04:48.563
- Let's get started.

04:48.563 --> 04:50.550
- That's my supervisor, Sharon.

04:50.550 --> 04:53.320
She's required by corporate to
hold these biweekly meetings

04:53.320 --> 04:56.400
which are a complete waste of time.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.650
I mean, I can't even
act like I care anymore.

04:59.650 --> 05:00.840
Not at all.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.140
Now you've already met Steve and Angela.

05:03.140 --> 05:06.150
That's Holly and to her right is Greg.

05:06.150 --> 05:09.680
The people I work with
make this job bearable.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.600
Now the only reason I ask
questions in these stupid meetings

05:12.600 --> 05:15.722
is to keep myself from falling asleep.

05:15.722 --> 05:20.722
♪ We said all that we could say ♪

05:21.719 --> 05:26.719
♪ Can you relate to me in another way ♪

05:28.048 --> 05:32.048
♪ We said all that we could say ♪

05:34.230 --> 05:35.764
Uh-oh.

05:35.764 --> 05:36.943
- What?

05:36.943 --> 05:38.790
- When a woman is looking at a dude

05:38.790 --> 05:40.549
like you looking at me now-

05:40.549 --> 05:43.778
- First of all, I'm not just some woman.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.426
I am Sanaa Medcalf,

05:45.426 --> 05:47.400
the love of your life.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.300
Now rephrase that.

05:49.370 --> 05:50.997
- Okay.

05:50.997 --> 05:54.300
When my crazy ass girlfriend, Sanaa,

05:54.300 --> 05:57.030
is looking at me like
you looking at me now.

05:57.030 --> 05:58.441
- Now why am I crazy?

05:59.829 --> 06:03.237
- Because, damn, Sanaa,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

06:03.237 --> 06:06.180
You gotta be at court
first thing in the morning.

06:06.180 --> 06:08.831
And let's not forget we just had the best-

06:08.831 --> 06:10.900
- We did not just have sex.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.159
We made love.

06:14.210 --> 06:16.080
- Are you gonna let me
finish the sentence?

06:16.080 --> 06:17.073
- I just did.

06:18.818 --> 06:20.068
- Just ask your question.

06:24.700 --> 06:25.533
- Well,

06:26.940 --> 06:28.590
do you believe in open marriages?

06:29.820 --> 06:31.610
- We're not married.

06:31.610 --> 06:32.443
- Exactly.

06:32.443 --> 06:34.073
So, I'm not talking about us.

06:34.920 --> 06:35.920
Answer the question.

06:37.860 --> 06:38.693
- No.

06:38.693 --> 06:40.353
I don't believe in open marriages.

06:41.503 --> 06:42.920
- So you feel like you
could stay with one person

06:42.920 --> 06:44.220
for the rest of your life?

06:45.390 --> 06:46.343
- Well I hope so.

06:47.729 --> 06:49.329
- Do you think that's realistic?

06:51.593 --> 06:52.790
- Yeah.

06:52.790 --> 06:53.643
Yeah, I do.

06:54.830 --> 06:55.663
- I don't.

06:57.660 --> 07:01.833
I think that some women
and most men cheat.

07:03.110 --> 07:05.580
So, things would work out a lot better

07:05.580 --> 07:06.480
if they could just be open

07:06.480 --> 07:08.403
and honest with each other from the start.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.490
- Okay, so why get married

07:11.490 --> 07:13.820
if you wanna have sex with other people?

07:13.820 --> 07:14.670
Just stay single.

07:18.441 --> 07:19.925
- Do you think that I love you?

07:19.925 --> 07:22.208
- I hope so.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.609
- Stop being silly. You know I love you.

07:25.609 --> 07:27.353
- Yes, baby, I know, I know.

07:27.353 --> 07:28.353
You love me.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.970
- What if I told you I wanted
to have sex with someone else?

07:31.970 --> 07:33.120
- Man or woman?

07:33.960 --> 07:35.072
- Does it matter?

07:35.072 --> 07:36.121
- Yeah.

07:36.121 --> 07:36.954
- Why?

07:36.954 --> 07:37.790
- Because if it's a woman,

07:37.790 --> 07:39.473
I may wanna watch.

07:40.410 --> 07:42.920
But if it's a man, I'm gonna
tell you to keep it moving.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.800
- Well, I wouldn't mind if you
had sex with another woman.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.963
- Okay, what's really going on here?

07:55.280 --> 07:56.452
- Nothing.

07:56.452 --> 07:58.980
We're just having a discussion, babe.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.863
- Are you serious with all this?

08:02.630 --> 08:04.240
- I just wanna pick your brain.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.650
I think it's healthy for couples

08:05.650 --> 08:08.036
to have these types of conversations.

08:08.036 --> 08:10.500
♪ Show me, show me ♪

08:10.500 --> 08:11.333
- Okay.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.620
What if I said I wanted to
have sex with your sister?

08:17.030 --> 08:17.863
- Karima?

08:18.890 --> 08:20.960
- Yeah, Karima.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.663
What if I said I wanted
to have sex with Karima?

08:24.500 --> 08:25.917
- So that's how you look at her?

08:25.917 --> 08:29.050
- No, but you just
sat up in here and said

08:29.050 --> 08:31.420
you could watch me have
sex with another woman.

08:31.420 --> 08:33.370
So what if that other woman was Karima?

08:34.470 --> 08:36.303
- Yeah, but the fact that she was

08:36.303 --> 08:39.250
the first person you thought about

08:39.250 --> 08:41.072
makes me believe that
that's how you think of her.

08:41.072 --> 08:43.050
- No, it doesn't.

08:43.050 --> 08:44.443
- Yes, it does.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.110
- Wait!

08:48.110 --> 08:49.350
Sanaa.

08:49.350 --> 08:51.293
Don't leave, Sanaa. Wait a minute!

08:52.540 --> 08:53.560
Come on, hey, sweetheart.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.090
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:55.090 --> 08:56.142
Come back.

08:57.150 --> 08:58.029
I knew it.

08:58.029 --> 08:59.300
I knew it, I knew it,

08:59.300 --> 09:01.193
and I still took the bait.

09:02.680 --> 09:03.513
Boo.
- You know what?

09:03.513 --> 09:06.660
This whole time that we've
been hanging out with Karima

09:06.660 --> 09:09.410
you were secretly hoping I
would get drunk and fall asleep

09:09.410 --> 09:11.170
so you could have sex with her.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.960
- Get drunk? Fall asleep?

09:12.960 --> 09:14.030
What are you talking about?

09:14.030 --> 09:15.370
I didn't start this. You did!

09:15.370 --> 09:17.250
- I was speaking hypothetically.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.013
- Can we just get back in
bed and talk about this?

09:19.013 --> 09:19.846
- No.

09:19.846 --> 09:20.840
- Why are you feeling some type of way

09:20.840 --> 09:22.613
about a conversation you started?

09:23.620 --> 09:24.660
- Don't you remember me telling you

09:24.660 --> 09:26.280
about the last guy I dated

09:26.280 --> 09:28.203
who only used me to get to Karima?

09:34.840 --> 09:35.891
- Jesus.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.113
Where's your car, man?

10:07.113 --> 10:08.590

10:08.590 --> 10:09.520
- I hear you.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.270
See the people, get a
little creative inspiration.

10:12.270 --> 10:13.520
- Exactly.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.350
That's all the footage from Rio.

10:15.350 --> 10:17.440
You see the edit notes
that I put in your email?

10:17.440 --> 10:18.960
- Yeah, I got it.
- Perfect.

That's what I'm talking about.
- All right, man.

10:26.199 --> 10:27.700
- All right, I'll give you a
call in about a week or so.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.533
- All right, bet.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:29.366 --> 10:30.220
Let's go burn one.
- No, no, man.

10:30.220 --> 10:31.627

Are you still mad at me

11:17.523 --> 11:20.347
about what I said about
your sister the other night?

11:22.300 --> 11:23.133
- Yeah.

11:23.133 --> 11:24.500
I'm in my feelings a little bit.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.370
- So you brought me out here

11:25.370 --> 11:27.300
so you could be mad face-to-face?

11:27.300 --> 11:28.133
- Pretty much.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.840
- Babe, we were just
having a conversation.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.740
I really didn't mean anything by that.

11:35.290 --> 11:36.520
And you laughin'.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.860
What's so funny?

11:37.860 --> 11:40.190
- I'm not really mad at you.

11:40.190 --> 11:42.450
I just wanted to see
you squirm a little bit.

11:42.450 --> 11:43.900
- Really?

11:43.900 --> 11:45.210
- I mean, yeah, okay.

11:45.210 --> 11:47.250
I was a little upset that night

11:47.250 --> 11:49.000
but I thought about it and, like you said,

11:49.000 --> 11:50.750
we were just having a conversation.

11:51.700 --> 11:52.710
But.

11:52.710 --> 11:53.543
- But.

11:54.490 --> 11:56.320
- If we're ever out with Karima

11:56.320 --> 11:59.373
and I even so much as think
that you're checking her out,

11:59.373 --> 12:01.170
I'ma have your ass sent for a year.

12:01.170 --> 12:02.859
- Yeah, I hear you, babe.

12:02.859 --> 12:04.610
I'm a peaceful brother.

12:04.610 --> 12:06.528
I don't want none of your
people pulling up on me.

12:07.466 --> 12:09.466
You gonna have your goons pull up on me?

12:10.621 --> 12:11.454
- I might.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.260
- So, why did you wanna meet out here?

12:25.260 --> 12:26.530
- Okay.

12:26.530 --> 12:27.460
Um...

12:29.870 --> 12:31.120
I am considering

12:33.660 --> 12:35.547
moving to New York.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.993
- New York? Why?

12:37.890 --> 12:40.200
- Well, a partner's retiring

12:40.200 --> 12:42.823
and they named a woman to replace him,

12:42.823 --> 12:44.060
a black woman.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.200
So she reached out

12:45.200 --> 12:48.193
and she said that this would
be a good opportunity for me.

12:49.050 --> 12:50.760
- Opportunity to do what?

12:50.760 --> 12:52.013
- To make partner.

12:53.900 --> 12:54.733
- Did they say that they

12:54.733 --> 12:56.360
were gonna make you partner, Sanaa?

12:56.360 --> 12:58.910
- Well no, but with her on my side

12:58.910 --> 13:00.310
I have a pretty good chance.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.623
- So is this definite?

13:06.190 --> 13:07.330
- Well, no, nothing's definite

13:07.330 --> 13:08.907
especially I haven't
talked to you about it.

13:08.907 --> 13:11.320
- Babe, I appreciate that, I really do,

13:11.320 --> 13:13.533
but damn.

13:15.070 --> 13:15.903
New York?

13:17.290 --> 13:18.740
- I want you to come with me.

13:18.740 --> 13:20.380
- How am I gonna go with you?

13:20.380 --> 13:23.260
I'd have to find a job
and what about my house?

13:23.260 --> 13:25.830
- Yeah, I mean, there's
plenty of insurance companies

13:25.830 --> 13:26.663
in New York

13:26.663 --> 13:28.837
and your house, shit, you can rent that.

13:28.837 --> 13:32.050
- I don't want another job
in the insurance business.

13:32.050 --> 13:33.180
And I'm not just gonna be able

13:33.180 --> 13:35.770
to rent my house out just like that.

13:35.770 --> 13:37.281
- Babe, you work in insurance already.

13:37.281 --> 13:38.114
I don't see what the difference is.

13:38.114 --> 13:40.740
- I don't want another
insurance job, Sanaa.

13:40.740 --> 13:42.530
I wanna travel so I can blog about it.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.340
- Yeah, you can do that eventually,

13:44.340 --> 13:46.170
but babe, right now,

13:46.170 --> 13:47.285
I mean, come on, this is-
- Wait, wait, wait,

13:47.285 --> 13:49.400
wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.820
If we moved to New York,

13:50.820 --> 13:53.157
it's gonna about money, marriage,

13:53.157 --> 13:54.957
and Sanaa, what if you get pregnant?

13:56.140 --> 13:57.793
- Well, what would be so wrong about that?

13:57.793 --> 13:59.950
- Nothing would be wrong with any of that

13:59.950 --> 14:01.600
once I'm established as a writer.

14:04.230 --> 14:05.460
- All right.

14:05.460 --> 14:06.460
I'll leave it alone.

14:07.510 --> 14:09.753
I'm not gonna rush you into anything.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.163
Just know that this is a
huge opportunity for me.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.090
A game changer.

14:17.090 --> 14:17.923
You hear?

14:17.923 --> 14:19.393
- I get it. I get it, okay?

14:24.570 --> 14:25.600
- Come on.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.633
Give me a hug.

14:43.762 --> 14:45.650
- Oh, Tony.

14:45.650 --> 14:46.940
Uncle Tony!

14:46.940 --> 14:48.770
- Nephew, what's going on, baby?

14:48.770 --> 14:50.350
- What's good?

14:50.350 --> 14:51.183
Come on in.

14:52.514 --> 14:54.190
Hey man, why don't you get
yourself a nine millimeter

14:54.190 --> 14:55.750
and get rid of that starter pistol?

14:55.750 --> 14:56.662
- Shit, it'll put a hole in you.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.250
- Yeah, but you only got six shots.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.870
- Shit, all I need is one.

14:59.870 --> 15:02.540
- I still say you need a
nine millimeter though.

15:02.540 --> 15:03.973
- Nah, revolvers don't jam.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.895
Hold on, hold on.

15:06.895 --> 15:08.470
- What?

15:08.470 --> 15:09.650
- How are you gonna have
me over here at dinner time

15:09.650 --> 15:11.151
and I don't smell no grease?

15:11.151 --> 15:12.920
- Uncle, who said anything about cooking?

15:12.920 --> 15:14.550
I called you over here so we can talk.

15:14.550 --> 15:16.089
- How you gonna have family
over here at dinner time

15:16.089 --> 15:17.420
and you ain't got no food on the table?

15:17.420 --> 15:18.650
- I don't even cook for myself.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.510
So you know I'm not cooking you jack.

15:20.510 --> 15:22.700
- Well, since I can't get a meal,

15:22.700 --> 15:23.700
what you got me over here for?

15:23.700 --> 15:26.010
Make it quick. I got shit to do.

15:26.010 --> 15:27.791
- Scored
Edwards landed three goals

15:27.791 --> 15:30.665
helping pass the Wolves eight to three.

15:30.665 --> 15:32.915
The chargers throttled
the Bucks nine to two.

15:35.090 --> 15:36.700
- You know this some bullshit, right?

15:36.700 --> 15:37.533
- Tonight the Bullets

15:37.533 --> 15:39.160
put their first place lead on the line

15:39.160 --> 15:40.394
in a game with with the Tempests.

15:40.394 --> 15:42.263
- Do you remember my girlfriend, right?

15:44.800 --> 15:47.360
- The one we went to the Falcons
game with last year, right?

15:47.360 --> 15:48.307
- Yeah, Sanaa.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.223
- Yeah, I remember.

15:51.390 --> 15:52.477
- What do you think?

15:54.960 --> 15:55.793
- Personally?

15:57.460 --> 15:59.160
I usually like them a little
thicker than that, you know?

15:59.160 --> 16:00.460
I like them like Serena Williams.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.210
That real big fat-

16:02.210 --> 16:04.440
- Timeout, Uncle, timeout, timeout.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.824
Whoo.

16:05.824 --> 16:06.710
You wild, Unc.

16:06.710 --> 16:08.082
That's not what I meant.

16:08.082 --> 16:09.910
- Damn, I'm just fucking with you.

16:09.910 --> 16:10.913
I know what you meant.

16:10.913 --> 16:12.913
- What do you think about her?

16:14.738 --> 16:17.060
- I mean, you know, she seems nice.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.710
You know, I didn't talk to her that much.

16:19.710 --> 16:20.830
She's a lawyer, right?

16:20.830 --> 16:21.663
- Yeah.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.340
- What's the problem?

16:24.340 --> 16:26.420
- She got a job offer in New York,

16:26.420 --> 16:27.980
wants me to go with her.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.270
- Weigh your options, make a decision.

16:30.270 --> 16:31.610
- Oh, I don't wanna go

16:31.610 --> 16:33.540
but I love her, I care about her.

16:33.540 --> 16:34.980
So me saying, "I don't wanna go"

16:34.980 --> 16:36.750
it's just not that easy.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.240
- So if you don't wanna go, don't go.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.490
All that other stuff is your heart

16:40.490 --> 16:42.140
trying to override what your mind

16:43.780 --> 16:45.030
knows to be true.

16:45.030 --> 16:47.250
- I don't know if I
wanna go down this road.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.042
- You plan on marrying her?

16:49.042 --> 16:51.020
- I don't know. We haven't
talked about all that.

16:51.020 --> 16:53.311
- Do you think she wants to marry you?

16:53.311 --> 16:55.070
- I don't know. I don't know.

16:55.070 --> 16:56.690
- It's a yes or no question.

16:56.690 --> 16:57.870
- Yes.

16:57.870 --> 16:58.703
- Okay.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.620
And you say you care about her.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.453
- I do.

17:03.910 --> 17:06.226
- You say you care about her

17:06.226 --> 17:07.059
but you don't wanna tell her

17:07.059 --> 17:08.743
that you don't wanna move to New York.

17:12.303 --> 17:13.620
That doesn't make any sense to me.

17:13.620 --> 17:16.380
- That's why I'm over here
talking to you about it.

17:16.380 --> 17:17.213
- The Gladiators

17:17.213 --> 17:18.876
shouldn't have much
trouble with the Henchmen

17:18.876 --> 17:20.680
and the Barbarians are still 14.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.980
- If you say you care about her

17:22.980 --> 17:23.813
and you're not ready to commit,

17:23.813 --> 17:24.910
what you gotta do

17:26.900 --> 17:28.720
is let her go to New York
and meet other people.

17:28.720 --> 17:29.720
-
Five games were featured

17:29.720 --> 17:32.130
in hockey action last evening.

17:32.130 --> 17:34.200
- If she meets a guy that
she wants to be with,

17:34.200 --> 17:35.033
you let her go.

17:36.770 --> 17:39.820
That's the way you treat
somebody you care about.

17:39.820 --> 17:40.840
Now the selfish thing to do

17:40.840 --> 17:43.350
is to, is to, you know,

17:43.350 --> 17:44.807
lie to yourself and lie to her

17:44.807 --> 17:46.320
and keep her around

17:46.320 --> 17:47.610
until you figure out what you wanna do

17:47.610 --> 17:49.810
with no regard to how
it's gonna affect her.

17:50.950 --> 17:53.224
- So just tell her I don't wanna go?

17:53.224 --> 17:54.560
- Why don't you wanna go?

17:54.560 --> 17:57.429
- Because, Unc, I wanna quit my job.

17:57.429 --> 17:58.262
You know that.

17:58.262 --> 17:59.100
I wanna travel,

17:59.100 --> 18:00.340
I wanna shoot my videos,

18:00.340 --> 18:01.477
I wanna blog and I wanna write about it

18:01.477 --> 18:03.520
and if I go off to New York with her,

18:03.520 --> 18:04.833
it's gonna be about her,
it's gonna be more expensive,

18:04.833 --> 18:08.330
and I'm never gonna
able to do my own thing.

18:08.330 --> 18:09.494
- Why don't you just make-

18:10.327 --> 18:11.160
Hold on a second.

18:13.630 --> 18:15.260
Hello?

18:15.260 --> 18:16.163
- The
front running Bullets

18:16.163 --> 18:17.503
ripped the Crusaders 14-three

18:17.503 --> 18:20.620
and the Dragons got
past the Jets seven-six.

18:20.620 --> 18:22.700
- No, I don't care nothing...

18:22.700 --> 18:23.900
Well who is still there?

18:26.680 --> 18:28.320
No, fuck that.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.050
I'm gonna say it just like this.

18:30.050 --> 18:31.840
You tell whoever is still at the house

18:31.840 --> 18:34.560
to tell Shamal that he better
find me before I find him.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.121
It's as simple as that.

18:36.121 --> 18:37.860
All right, I'll see
y'all when I get there.

18:37.860 --> 18:38.911
I gotta go.

18:38.911 --> 18:39.911
- All right.

18:43.030 --> 18:44.810
Hey, when you gonna stop
by and look at the deck?

18:44.810 --> 18:45.790
- Your deck?

18:45.790 --> 18:48.220
- Yeah, remember I told
you some stairs were loose.

18:48.220 --> 18:49.093
- Uh.

18:50.210 --> 18:51.600
What about this time next Wednesday?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.180
- Wednesday works.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.013
All right, now.

19:05.320 --> 19:06.320
Who are you texting?

19:07.290 --> 19:09.337
- Oh, it's just someone from work.

19:09.337 --> 19:11.323
- Can it wait till tomorrow?

19:12.760 --> 19:13.610
- No, she actually,

19:13.610 --> 19:15.660
she's working out of her New York office.

19:21.970 --> 19:22.803
What?

19:24.230 --> 19:27.194
- You should go natural, grow an Afro.

19:28.027 --> 19:28.860
- No.

19:29.720 --> 19:30.827
Yeah, no.

19:30.827 --> 19:32.874
- I'm serious, baby.

19:32.874 --> 19:34.330
- No, sweetheart, that's not me.

19:34.330 --> 19:36.660
Plus I don't think that'll
go over well at work.

19:36.660 --> 19:37.830
- Ah, so that's it.

19:37.830 --> 19:39.330
They won't let you go natural.

19:40.330 --> 19:42.140
- No, they can't stop me.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.300
But I think that it might
inhibit my advancement.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.500
- Chemicals and all, out
here trying to assimilate.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.710
- I am not trying to assimilate.

19:50.710 --> 19:52.320
I like my hair the way it is.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.990
I got you with my hair like this.

19:53.990 --> 19:57.770
- Damn, babe, that's because
I used to squint real hard

19:57.770 --> 20:00.752
and then I'd fantasize, ooh,

20:00.752 --> 20:03.447
with a big old Angela Davis Afro!

20:03.447 --> 20:05.173
You would look like this, babe.

20:19.470 --> 20:20.303
So you wanna talk about

20:20.303 --> 20:23.183
that big pink elephant sitting
in that chair over there?

20:24.347 --> 20:25.547
- Oh, you mean New York?

20:27.856 --> 20:28.689
- Yes.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.333
- Well, I wanna go.

20:36.025 --> 20:37.175
Are you coming with me?

20:40.640 --> 20:41.473
- No.

20:43.922 --> 20:45.127
- Well, why not?

20:46.006 --> 20:48.310
You don't think it would
be a good move for us?

20:48.310 --> 20:50.820
- I think it'd be a great
move for you and your career.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.070
- No, it would be a good
move for the both of us.

20:53.070 --> 20:55.040
I mean, you've established a career

20:55.040 --> 20:56.580
in the insurance industry

20:56.580 --> 20:58.170
and you can just take it to the next level

20:58.170 --> 20:59.490
by coming to New York.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.610
- Sanaa, you know I don't like my job.

21:01.610 --> 21:02.560
I hate it.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.360
- Yeah, but your
job is your reality.

21:05.360 --> 21:09.860
- You know, to me, you only
got two options in life.

21:09.860 --> 21:11.870
You can either live your dream

21:11.870 --> 21:13.290
or help someone else live theirs.

21:13.290 --> 21:16.090
And I'm tired of helping other
people live their dreams.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.520
- So you think coming to New York,

21:18.520 --> 21:20.560
you'll be helping me live my dream?

21:20.560 --> 21:25.000
- I was talking about
me, my life, my career.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.730
I wanna get up and do
what I love for a living.

21:28.730 --> 21:30.370
- That's unrealistic.

21:30.370 --> 21:32.000
I mean, I love my career too,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.230
but there's sometimes I don't
feel like getting out of bed.

21:34.230 --> 21:36.361
I mean, everybody feels like that.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.570
- Would you practice law for free?

21:38.570 --> 21:39.670
- No.

21:39.670 --> 21:41.340
- Well see, I travel,

21:41.340 --> 21:43.320
I shoot video, and I blog about it

21:43.320 --> 21:45.570
and I do it for free because I love it

21:45.570 --> 21:47.570
and I wanna do what I love for a living.

21:49.060 --> 21:51.363
- What you're talking about is a hobby.

21:52.620 --> 21:54.110
- I'm gonna make a career out of it.

21:54.110 --> 21:56.427
I don't know why you
don't understand that.

21:59.849 --> 22:02.277
- So you're really not coming?

22:02.277 --> 22:03.840
- No, I gotta be on the right path

22:03.840 --> 22:05.650
before I can make a move like that.

22:11.860 --> 22:12.860
- Well what about us?

22:12.860 --> 22:13.750
- If you go to New York

22:13.750 --> 22:14.800
and you're meeting another people

22:14.800 --> 22:16.688
and you're working on-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:16.688 --> 22:18.102
Hold on.
- What, what?

22:18.102 --> 22:19.690
- Meeting other people?

22:19.690 --> 22:21.730
I thought we were in a
committed relationship.

22:21.730 --> 22:22.980
- We are.

22:22.980 --> 22:26.280
- So why are you talking
about meeting other people?

22:26.280 --> 22:27.650
Is that what you're trying to do?

22:27.650 --> 22:28.490
- Of course not.

22:28.490 --> 22:29.640
But what I'm saying is-

22:29.640 --> 22:30.977
- No, I heard exactly what you said.

22:30.977 --> 22:33.270
I think it's some bullshit.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.650
I think that you had a Freudian slip

22:34.650 --> 22:36.340
and now you're trying
to reel back from it.

22:36.340 --> 22:37.603
- It wasn't a Freudian slip.

22:37.603 --> 22:38.510
I meant what I said.

22:38.510 --> 22:39.343
- I know!

22:39.343 --> 22:40.995
- Hold on, hold on.
- No, don't touch me!

22:40.995 --> 22:41.828
- Will you just relax?

22:41.828 --> 22:42.661
Babe, just chill out for a minute.

22:42.661 --> 22:45.173
- Get off of me!
- Okay, I'm not touching you.

22:48.150 --> 22:49.640
- So, what, I'm supposed to think

22:49.640 --> 22:51.840
that you're going to sit
in front of your computer

22:51.840 --> 22:53.891
for 24 hours?

22:53.891 --> 22:54.724
You know what?

22:55.860 --> 22:57.180
If you didn't wanna be together,

22:57.180 --> 22:58.843
you should've just said something.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.540
I can't do this.

23:01.540 --> 23:02.777
- Wait a minute.

23:02.777 --> 23:03.610
Hold on.

23:05.110 --> 23:05.943
Come on now.

23:08.144 --> 23:09.150
Can we talk about this?

23:09.150 --> 23:10.340
- We just did!

23:10.340 --> 23:12.840
- I don't wanna leave
things unresolved like this!

23:33.100 --> 23:35.670
May I speak to Oscar Heiler, please?

23:35.670 --> 23:37.420
Yes, ma'am. My name is James Hayes.

23:38.690 --> 23:42.490
Yeah, I submitted an article
for next month's publication.

23:42.490 --> 23:43.323
Good morning.

23:43.323 --> 23:44.660
My name is James Hayes

23:44.660 --> 23:46.600
and I submitted a story for December

23:46.600 --> 23:48.300
and I got an email from you guys

23:48.300 --> 23:50.940
saying that you needed some
more source information.

23:50.940 --> 23:53.012
This is James Hayes.

23:53.012 --> 23:53.845
Mm-hmm.

23:53.845 --> 23:55.670
And I submitted a piece.

23:55.670 --> 23:57.430
Hey Beau, what's going on, man?

23:57.430 --> 23:58.780
I'm doing good.

23:58.780 --> 24:01.700
Hey, well I was looking at the rough cut

24:01.700 --> 24:03.340
from Rio last night

24:03.340 --> 24:05.940
and there's some things I
wanna incorporate into it.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.260
Yeah, yeah.

24:08.260 --> 24:09.860
I'm gonna send you the edit now.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.120
Be careful.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.640
See what I'm talking about?

24:18.640 --> 24:20.730
This, this?

24:20.730 --> 24:21.900
- Oh yeah, damn.

24:21.900 --> 24:22.733
- Yeah.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.463
All of that.

24:28.460 --> 24:29.903
- Yeah, see here, see?

24:31.050 --> 24:32.370
They used nails instead of screws

24:32.370 --> 24:33.210
and they're pulling right out.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.437
- Oh, okay, okay.

24:35.437 --> 24:37.143
- That's an easy fix though.

24:39.090 --> 24:41.073
- So how much is it going to cost me?

24:42.021 --> 24:42.870
- It's not gonna cost you anything.

24:42.870 --> 24:44.590
I'm gonna show you exactly
what needs to be done

24:44.590 --> 24:45.770
and I'm gonna watch you do it.

24:45.770 --> 24:48.280
- Come on, Unc, you know
I'm not handy like that.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.113
- Yeah, I know,

24:49.113 --> 24:49.960
that's why I'm gonna supervise.

24:52.110 --> 24:54.210
You talk to Sanaa about going to New York?

24:55.710 --> 24:56.710
- Yeah.

24:56.710 --> 24:57.543
- And?

24:58.740 --> 24:59.773
- She's in New York.

25:02.930 --> 25:04.817
- I take that to mean you're not goin'?

25:08.710 --> 25:10.500
- I told her to go up there, chill,

25:10.500 --> 25:11.850
and she didn't find someone,

25:11.850 --> 25:13.200
maybe we could be together.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.730
- Is that how you said it to her?

25:16.730 --> 25:17.563
- Yeah.

25:17.563 --> 25:19.490
- No wonder she left.

25:19.490 --> 25:20.323
- What you mean?

25:20.323 --> 25:21.187
That's what you told me to say.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.960
- Yeah, but I thought
you'd be smart enough

25:22.960 --> 25:25.200
to say it the right way.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.440
- Well, be that as it may,
what's done is done, so.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.504
- When did she leave?

25:30.504 --> 25:32.340
- Mm, about two weeks ago.

25:32.340 --> 25:34.690
- When was the last time you spoke to her?

25:34.690 --> 25:36.230
- Tried to call her numerous times,

25:36.230 --> 25:37.670
she won't answer the phone,

25:37.670 --> 25:39.320
won't respond to my texts either.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.740
- So how's the video blogging
and writing stuff going?

25:45.740 --> 25:46.830
- Now that's going good.

25:46.830 --> 25:49.513
As a matter of fact, on my way to Europe.

25:50.390 --> 25:51.373
- Europe?
- Yeah.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.917
- Didn't you just come back
from Rio a couple months ago?

25:54.917 --> 25:56.060
- Mm-hmm.

25:56.060 --> 25:59.560
- Are you sure that you
can afford to go to Europe?

25:59.560 --> 26:01.010
- Unc, I can't afford not to.

26:04.170 --> 26:05.620
- I respect that.

26:05.620 --> 26:07.120
Stepping out on faith.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.730
- Coming from you, that
means everything, man.

26:09.730 --> 26:10.563
Everything.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.017
So what's up with this?

26:15.850 --> 26:16.683
- Next weekend.

26:16.683 --> 26:18.140
Yeah, next weekend should be good.

26:18.140 --> 26:19.400
- Cool.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.200
- Since you're a writer,

26:21.200 --> 26:22.910
the next time you have
something to say to Sanaa,

26:22.910 --> 26:25.200
you should probably
write to her, all right?

26:25.200 --> 26:26.473
This way there's a 50/50 chance

26:26.473 --> 26:27.610
that you'll be able to edit yourself

26:27.610 --> 26:29.130
before you say some stupid shit like,

26:29.130 --> 26:30.592
I wanna have a threesome with her sister.

26:30.592 --> 26:31.425
- You think you
know what, you got jokes.

26:31.425 --> 26:32.258
You think you funny.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.219
- I'm serious.

26:33.219 --> 26:34.380
- So that's
how you do nephew, huh?

26:34.380 --> 26:35.810
- It might be the best
advice I ever gave you.

26:35.810 --> 26:36.950
- You got jokes. Very funny.

26:36.950 --> 26:38.612
- Now let's get out of
here. It's hot as shit.

26:38.612 --> 26:40.270
- Of course.

26:40.270 --> 26:42.100
Going at me about her sister.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.433
Boy, I tell you.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.085
Yes, sir.

26:51.085 --> 26:52.710
Firststateinsurance.com.

26:52.710 --> 26:54.370
Just like it's...

26:54.370 --> 26:55.920
Yes, sir, I'll spell it for you.

26:55.920 --> 27:00.920
F-I-R-S-T insurance.com. That's right.

27:03.370 --> 27:04.890
Okay.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.010
Yeah, once I receive it,

27:06.010 --> 27:07.410
I should be able to get payment to you

27:07.410 --> 27:08.940
in a couple of days.

27:08.940 --> 27:10.210
Yes, sir.

27:10.210 --> 27:11.363
Thank you for calling.

27:18.780 --> 27:19.870
Good morning. This is Jay.

27:19.870 --> 27:20.913
How can I help you?

27:24.950 --> 27:27.450
You wanna know if I received
the email, Mr. Frowd?

27:28.290 --> 27:29.893
Did you get an error message?

27:32.070 --> 27:34.783
Well then that means the
email was received, sir.

27:35.890 --> 27:37.330
Yeah, they kinda got this email thing

27:37.330 --> 27:38.795
pretty much figured out.

28:05.680 --> 28:06.710
to pay for my hotel room.

28:06.710 --> 28:07.979
They won't let me back
in the room until I pay.

28:07.979 --> 28:09.279
- No, I can't help you.

28:09.279 --> 28:10.380
- You don't have to give the money to me.

28:10.380 --> 28:11.784
Just go to the lobby.

28:11.784 --> 28:13.084
- I don't have any change.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.430
- Man.

28:18.350 --> 28:21.064
Excuse me, Miss. Excuse me.

28:22.090 --> 28:24.290
- When people
come up to me begging,

28:25.240 --> 28:26.953
I usually just brush them off.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.370
But for some reason,

28:29.370 --> 28:32.863
I couldn't forget about
that woman at the store.

29:52.400 --> 29:55.650
- Look, I appreciate you
taking care of this room

29:55.650 --> 29:58.750
and helping me with my bags and all,

29:58.750 --> 30:00.507
but I don't have nothing for you.

30:07.919 --> 30:10.419
- How did you end up homeless?

30:17.192 --> 30:20.260
- We ain't even got that kind of time.

30:20.260 --> 30:21.683
- As a matter of fact, I do.

30:30.910 --> 30:32.000
All right, now look.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.180
This is just gonna be two people

30:33.180 --> 30:34.870
having a conversation, okay.

30:34.870 --> 30:35.840
Real easy.

30:35.840 --> 30:36.990
We're just talking

30:36.990 --> 30:38.815
like we did a couple of days ago, okay?

30:38.815 --> 30:39.648
- Okay.

30:39.648 --> 30:40.966
All right.

30:40.966 --> 30:42.380
Where do I start?

30:42.380 --> 30:43.283
- Why don't you tell me

30:43.283 --> 30:46.450
the first recollection of your family?

30:48.086 --> 30:48.980
- Okay.

30:48.980 --> 30:53.723
It may sound strange but my
first memory is of my mom.

30:54.860 --> 30:58.023
She was arguing with someone
on the other side of the door.

30:58.930 --> 31:00.050
I was really little,

31:00.050 --> 31:02.360
maybe like two or three.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.040
I couldn't tell what
she was arguing about,

31:04.040 --> 31:06.940
but I remember that it was a man

31:06.940 --> 31:08.940
and she was so upset.

31:08.940 --> 31:10.710
He was screaming and cussing her out,

31:10.710 --> 31:12.800
calling out her name.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.883
It was a mess.

31:24.780 --> 31:25.860
Hello?

31:25.860 --> 31:27.150
- Hey, I just finished the edit.

31:27.150 --> 31:28.814
We're about to go live.

31:28.814 --> 31:30.370
- About to go live?

31:30.370 --> 31:32.310
- Yeah, the Gram, Twitter,

31:32.310 --> 31:35.500
Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo, everywhere.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.333
- Wait, okay.

31:36.333 --> 31:37.224
So how am I gonna see it?

31:37.224 --> 31:38.869
You know I don't have a phone.

31:38.869 --> 31:41.110
- They got computers in the
hotel lobby, don't they?

31:41.110 --> 31:43.370
- Yeah, but I never used them.

31:43.370 --> 31:45.768
- They're for the guests
and you're a guest.

31:45.768 --> 31:47.430
- All right, I'll check it out.

31:47.430 --> 31:48.560
- Okay.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.530
Hey, how's that job search going?

31:50.530 --> 31:53.350
- Nothing ye but I'm
gonna keep it pushing.

31:53.350 --> 31:54.630
- It's gonna happen for you.

31:54.630 --> 31:56.750
You're too strong of
a girl to be kept out.

31:56.750 --> 31:58.340
- Yeah, I really hope you're right.

31:58.340 --> 32:01.090
- Well, look, I'm gonna get
back to the grind, okay?

32:01.090 --> 32:02.790
You call me if you need something.

32:05.540 --> 32:08.240
- You want to take a six
week leave of absence

32:08.240 --> 32:10.210
to go to Europe to do what?

32:10.210 --> 32:11.453
- Well I'd like to finish a project

32:11.453 --> 32:12.626
I've been working on and I-

32:12.626 --> 32:14.550
- Project? What project?

32:14.550 --> 32:16.310
- Well, it has nothing
to do with insurance.

32:16.310 --> 32:17.830
It's something I actually
do outside of work.

32:17.830 --> 32:19.920
- And what kind of project is it?

32:19.920 --> 32:22.570
- Well I'm writing and shooting a video

32:22.570 --> 32:24.840
on international travel.

32:24.840 --> 32:27.980
- That's the kind of stuff
you do when you retire.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.280
- Well, the retired
people I see when I travel

32:30.280 --> 32:31.930
don't seem like they're
enjoying themselves.

32:31.930 --> 32:33.000
As a matter of fact, they look like

32:33.000 --> 32:35.020
they just wanna sit down somewhere

32:35.020 --> 32:36.840
and, you know, Sharon, I want to do this

32:36.840 --> 32:37.930
while I'm still young, you know,

32:37.930 --> 32:39.920
while I can still turn up.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.221
- Turn what up?

32:42.054 --> 32:43.850
- All I'm asking for is
three additional weeks

32:43.850 --> 32:45.623
on top of the three I already have.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.023
- Three weeks.

32:58.140 --> 33:00.000
- My first stop was in Southern France

33:00.000 --> 33:01.831
for the Cannes Film Festival.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.630
Natalie Portman, Kate
Blanchett were all there.

33:06.630 --> 33:09.250
I was also just on the outside,

33:09.250 --> 33:10.633
but I was there too.

33:14.849 --> 33:16.173
And then on to Paris.

33:25.140 --> 33:26.617
The Louvre Museum.

33:26.617 --> 33:29.453
By the way, the Mona Lisa is a lot smaller

33:29.453 --> 33:31.203
than you would think.

33:34.070 --> 33:37.570
Get a flight to Rome to see the Colosseum.

34:13.495 --> 34:15.578
And then back to reality.

34:36.083 --> 34:37.206
Hello?

34:37.206 --> 34:39.213
- Hey, it's Sanaa.

34:39.213 --> 34:40.450
- I know.

34:40.450 --> 34:43.410
I still have your number
programmed in my phone.

34:43.410 --> 34:44.770
- First of all, let me apologize

34:44.770 --> 34:47.470
for not taking your calls
or responding to your texts.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.133
- Yeah.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.560
I would've thought you were dead

34:52.560 --> 34:54.943
unless your mom would
have told me otherwise.

34:54.943 --> 34:56.526
- I just...

34:57.820 --> 35:01.320
It was a lot with the move and everything.

35:02.730 --> 35:04.270
- I get it.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.309
I get it, Sanaa.

35:05.309 --> 35:06.830
But I thought you may have

35:06.830 --> 35:08.780
at least called me before you left.

35:08.780 --> 35:11.630
- I wanted to but
I didn't know what to say.

35:11.630 --> 35:12.510
All I could think about

35:12.510 --> 35:14.760
was the fact that you
weren't coming with me.

35:14.760 --> 35:17.803
And I knew if I saw you, it
would all come back to that.

35:21.740 --> 35:23.280
- So how are things going?

35:23.280 --> 35:24.270
- Great.

35:24.270 --> 35:25.420
I'm learning a lot.

35:25.420 --> 35:27.670
I have more responsibility
than I did before.

35:28.626 --> 35:29.459
I'm adjusting.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.660
So what's going on with you?

35:31.660 --> 35:33.310
- Well I literally just
walked through the door

35:33.310 --> 35:34.520
from Europe.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.903
Phone rang and it was you.

35:36.903 --> 35:38.012
- Wow.

35:38.012 --> 35:39.870
I always wanted to go there.

35:39.870 --> 35:40.703
Couldn't wait to dump me

35:40.703 --> 35:42.351
so you could start jet setting, right?

35:44.060 --> 35:46.300
- So when are you coming back to Atlanta?

35:46.300 --> 35:47.714
- Thanksgiving.

35:47.714 --> 35:49.514
Yeah, I'll be back for Thanksgiving.

35:52.180 --> 35:54.780
- Well, when you get in town,

35:54.780 --> 35:56.630
if you got some time, give me a call.

35:59.494 --> 36:02.911
- That would be my first thought.

36:05.261 --> 36:07.010
Jay, can you hang on for a second?

36:07.010 --> 36:07.843
- Yeah.

36:11.612 --> 36:14.207
- I really have
to go. I'm still at work.

36:14.207 --> 36:16.524
It's good to hear your voice though, Jay.

36:16.524 --> 36:18.863
- Yeah, it was good talking to you too.

36:19.890 --> 36:21.326

Hey, are you looking for Beau?

36:58.930 --> 36:59.930
- Yeah, I am.

36:59.930 --> 37:01.060
- I just called him.

37:01.060 --> 37:03.280
He said he'd be here in about 20 minutes.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.113
- Wow.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.720
I don't have time to wait.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.760
All right. Thank you.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.610
- You're welcome.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.980
Hey, I was gonna tell you, if you...

37:21.980 --> 37:24.010
You wanna roll your
window down a little bit?

37:24.010 --> 37:25.330
- I can hear you.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.030
- Yeah, but I can barely hear you.

37:28.070 --> 37:30.170
- I'll talk louder.

37:30.170 --> 37:32.559
- What do you think I'm gonna do?

37:32.559 --> 37:33.760
- I don't know.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.360
- I'm saying I'm waiting
for Beau just like you are.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.213
- Okay.

37:39.190 --> 37:41.260
- I was just gonna say, you
know, if you had to leave,

37:41.260 --> 37:43.200
I could tell Beau that you were here,

37:43.200 --> 37:44.550
but you just couldn't stay.

37:45.940 --> 37:47.490
- I was just about to call him.

37:49.630 --> 37:51.119
I'm good. Thank you.

37:51.119 --> 37:52.027
- All right.

37:52.027 --> 37:53.610
I'm just trying to help.

37:53.610 --> 37:54.797
- Thank you.

37:54.797 --> 37:56.214
- You're welcome.

38:13.470 --> 38:14.303
- No.

38:15.830 --> 38:16.663
Why?

38:20.274 --> 38:23.143
Come on, come on, come on.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.033
Damn.

38:37.100 --> 38:39.860
Hey, do you mind if I use your phone?

38:39.860 --> 38:42.743
My battery died and I
don't have my charger.

38:44.650 --> 38:46.850
- Can I see your teeth first?

38:46.850 --> 38:49.380
- Why do you need to see my teeth?

38:49.380 --> 38:50.993
- To make sure you got some.

38:51.870 --> 38:53.683
There you go. That wasn't so hard.

38:55.770 --> 38:57.020
- It's locked.

38:57.020 --> 38:58.070
- Oh, my bad.

39:01.260 --> 39:02.160
- Thank you.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.257
- Mm-hmm.

39:16.690 --> 39:18.400
I just tried to call Beau

39:18.400 --> 39:19.690
just before you pulled up.

39:19.690 --> 39:20.700
He's probably not answering

39:20.700 --> 39:23.280
because he'll be here in a few minutes.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.660
- Okay.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.810
Well, I might as well sit.

39:26.810 --> 39:27.763
- Yeah, sit.

39:30.056 --> 39:31.456
- I guess I can wait on him.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.130
So when did you go to France?

39:36.330 --> 39:37.760
- Actually, a couple of weeks ago.

39:37.760 --> 39:38.593
That's why I'm here.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.500
Dropping off some of my footage to Beau.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.100
You ever been to France?

39:42.100 --> 39:44.010
- I went there to study for a semester.

39:44.010 --> 39:45.957
- Uh-huh, wow was it?

39:45.957 --> 39:46.950
- Um, it was nice.

39:46.950 --> 39:49.370
It was really a great experience.

39:49.370 --> 39:50.660
I got to see a lot of Europe

39:50.660 --> 39:53.820
and see a lot different
people, different cultures.

39:53.820 --> 39:54.850
It was cool.

39:54.850 --> 39:57.314
- You must speak French fluently.

39:59.470 --> 40:00.920
- Well, I wouldn't say fluently,

40:00.920 --> 40:02.420
but I know a little something.

40:04.260 --> 40:06.180
I mean, I think the problem
is that people from France,

40:06.180 --> 40:07.706
they speak so fast and the
accent is so different.

40:07.706 --> 40:08.956
- Right, right.

40:09.830 --> 40:10.920
- Yeah, I'm just used to people

40:10.920 --> 40:13.300
from America speaking
French and, you know,

40:13.300 --> 40:14.710
but I made it work.

40:14.710 --> 40:16.060
- There you go, there you go.

40:16.060 --> 40:19.047
Obviously, learning a foreign
language can be tough.

40:19.047 --> 40:19.880
- Mm-hmm.

40:20.767 --> 40:22.580
You go by yourself?

40:22.580 --> 40:24.010
- Yeah, I did.

40:24.010 --> 40:26.010
Actually, I needed to get
away for a little bit.

40:26.010 --> 40:28.330
I was also finishing up a project.

40:28.330 --> 40:30.470
Then I went to the Cannes Film Festival.

40:30.470 --> 40:31.830
Man, that was awesome.

40:31.830 --> 40:32.690
- What do you do?

40:32.690 --> 40:34.980
- I work for an insurance company.

40:34.980 --> 40:36.780
You know, but what I really wanna do

40:37.620 --> 40:41.130
is I wanna travel and shoot video

40:41.130 --> 40:44.060
and tell my story like only I can,

40:44.060 --> 40:45.700
you know what I mean?

40:45.700 --> 40:47.640
Yeah.
- Right. That's nice.

40:47.640 --> 40:48.660
- How about you?

40:48.660 --> 40:49.760
- I'm a photographer.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.550
- Head shots and baby photos?

40:51.550 --> 40:52.383
- No.

40:53.216 --> 40:55.990
More like urban landscapes and-

40:55.990 --> 40:56.823
- Really?

40:56.823 --> 40:59.460
- I like to take pictures of
people with interesting faces.

40:59.460 --> 41:00.713
- Nice, nice.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.150
- You know, I like how
natural light hits an object,

41:04.150 --> 41:06.020
so I just try to capture it.

41:06.020 --> 41:07.250
- That's awesome. That's awesome.

41:07.250 --> 41:09.400
I'd love to see some
of your work sometime.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.430
- Yeah, you can ask Beau.

41:10.430 --> 41:12.300
I'll let him know that you
wanna see some of my stuff.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.050
He's working on a reel
for me right now, so.

41:14.050 --> 41:16.710
- Mm, I would like for you

41:16.710 --> 41:18.363
to show me some of your work.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.273
- Why?

41:20.273 --> 41:22.650
- Because it's your work.

41:22.650 --> 41:23.483
Duh.

41:24.500 --> 41:25.333
I'm Jay.

41:26.330 --> 41:27.163
- Monet.

41:27.163 --> 41:28.030
Nice to meet you.

41:28.030 --> 41:29.013
- Nice to meet you.

41:30.150 --> 41:31.470
- So is Jay your government name

41:31.470 --> 41:32.692
or is it some kind of nickname?

41:32.692 --> 41:34.960
- Yeah, it's short for James.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.490
- Okay.

41:36.490 --> 41:37.730
And my name really is Monet,

41:37.730 --> 41:41.320
not Diamond or Lexi or
some kind of stage name.

41:41.320 --> 41:45.080
- You don't have a stage name, do you?

41:45.080 --> 41:46.130
- No.

41:46.130 --> 41:47.840
I haven't had a stage name

41:47.840 --> 41:49.790
since fifth grade when I played Juliet.

41:51.190 --> 41:52.740
And if I did have a stage name?

41:53.680 --> 41:55.080
- Gotta get it how you live.

41:56.990 --> 41:57.823
- Yeah, okay.

41:58.780 --> 42:00.160
Most men say they'd date a stripper,

42:00.160 --> 42:01.340
but if it came down to it,

42:01.340 --> 42:03.570
they wouldn't even take her seriously.

42:03.570 --> 42:05.880
- Wait, you trying to date me?

42:05.880 --> 42:06.817
- I didn't say you.

42:07.807 --> 42:10.757
I said most men.
- Oh, you did, you did.

42:13.414 --> 42:15.197
So when are you gonna let
me see some of your work?

42:20.300 --> 42:21.860
- I'll give you my number

42:21.860 --> 42:24.630
and then we can talk on the phone first

42:24.630 --> 42:26.160
and then we'll see.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.640
- Okay, so let me ask you this.

42:46.973 --> 42:51.270

43:08.630 --> 43:11.050
Commercially, you'd have to say Jay Z.

43:11.050 --> 43:14.140
But Illmatic may be the
illest album of all time.

43:14.140 --> 43:17.210
So is Nas the greatest?

43:17.210 --> 43:19.620
Then Snoop's been around 20 years

43:19.620 --> 43:22.710
and then you still got
Black Thought, Rakim,

43:22.710 --> 43:24.313
Eminem, Biggie, Pusha T.

43:25.180 --> 43:27.070
I mean, you could make an argument

43:27.070 --> 43:28.620
with any one of those guys, so.

43:30.380 --> 43:31.213
- Wow.

43:31.213 --> 43:32.970
Impressive.

43:32.970 --> 43:35.610
- My roommate when I was in grad school,

43:35.610 --> 43:37.640
she was an intern for a label.

43:37.640 --> 43:39.523
So she used to keep me up on everything.

43:40.460 --> 43:41.810
- Grad school?

43:41.810 --> 43:43.050
- Yeah.

43:43.050 --> 43:45.620
I got my master's degree in education,

43:45.620 --> 43:48.380
even though I knew I
wanted to be an artist.

43:48.380 --> 43:50.070
- So why get a master's in education

43:50.070 --> 43:52.533
if you wanted to be a photographer?

43:53.490 --> 43:55.490
- My parents wanted me to
have something to fall back on

43:55.490 --> 43:57.080
in case the creative
thing didn't work out.

43:57.080 --> 44:00.480
So I promised them that I
would get my master's degree

44:00.480 --> 44:02.850
and then they gave me a
little bit of seed money

44:02.850 --> 44:05.685
to tie me over just in
case things didn't work out

44:05.685 --> 44:08.453
and, you know, that way
I could get started.

44:09.980 --> 44:11.390
- Sounds like a waste of money to me.

44:11.390 --> 44:13.170
- Mm-mm.

44:13.170 --> 44:15.550
No, you are totally off base with that.

44:15.550 --> 44:17.230
- Okay, so tell me one meaningful thing

44:17.230 --> 44:19.360
you learned while you were in grad school.

44:19.360 --> 44:22.910
- The word Negus, N-E-G-U-S,

44:22.910 --> 44:26.140
is a word using in reference
to Ethiopian sovereignty

44:26.140 --> 44:29.340
and the root of the word, N-G-S a noun

44:29.340 --> 44:31.440
derived from the ancient language of Geez.

44:32.410 --> 44:34.700
So basically when someone refers

44:34.700 --> 44:36.830
to a group of people as niggas,

44:36.830 --> 44:39.230
they're basically calling
them a group of kings.

44:40.280 --> 44:41.600
- That's not true

44:41.600 --> 44:43.930
because I'm quite sure
that back in the day,

44:43.930 --> 44:47.160
master was not referring
to his slaves as kings.

44:47.160 --> 44:48.470
- Right, because they were ignorant

44:48.470 --> 44:51.330
about where the word came
from and what it meant

44:51.330 --> 44:53.763
much like yourself before I told you.

44:54.792 --> 44:56.192
- How do I know that's true?

44:57.420 --> 44:59.270
- Okay, well, since
you're a visual person,

44:59.270 --> 45:04.180
go to YouTube and type
in spelling bee N-E-G-U-S

45:05.100 --> 45:06.030
and then you don't even have to

45:06.030 --> 45:07.810
tax your little brain to read.

45:07.810 --> 45:10.410
They use it in a national spelling bee.

45:10.410 --> 45:15.380
Now there's so much more to the
etymology of the word nigger

45:15.380 --> 45:16.710
but I don't even want to go into it

45:16.710 --> 45:18.763
because your whole head might explode.

45:20.140 --> 45:22.562
- I'm just gonna let that go.

45:26.805 --> 45:28.320
I totally didn't mean to say that.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.670
I'm a good girl.

45:29.670 --> 45:30.760
- You know, we're gonna have to have

45:30.760 --> 45:33.750
some sort of date set up
before we get off this phone.

45:33.750 --> 45:36.260
I mean, we've been havin'
hella conversations

45:36.260 --> 45:38.440
and I feel like it's my duty,

45:38.440 --> 45:42.187
no, no, no, my obligation
to get us in the same space.

45:42.187 --> 45:43.880
I just wanna see you again

46:42.716 --> 46:44.683
that exhibits the same behavior?

46:45.530 --> 46:48.323
- Uh, for a guy?

46:52.640 --> 46:55.050
A player. Player?

46:55.050 --> 46:57.780
- Okay, so same, same situation,

46:57.780 --> 47:00.060
but different connotation based on gender?

47:00.060 --> 47:00.893
Right.

47:02.442 --> 47:04.080
And you think that's right?

47:04.080 --> 47:05.680
- Probably not, but I mean, let's face it.

47:05.680 --> 47:08.503
That's the reality of
the world we live in.

47:08.503 --> 47:09.650
- Ah.

47:09.650 --> 47:11.450
Kind of like how women
get paid way less money

47:11.450 --> 47:14.067
than men to do the same exact job.

47:14.067 --> 47:14.900
- Wait, wait, wait.

47:14.900 --> 47:16.090
Pay disparity is institutional.

47:16.090 --> 47:20.210
Sexual mores are more societal.

47:20.210 --> 47:21.210
Yeah.

47:21.210 --> 47:24.730
- Okay, and one affects the other.

47:24.730 --> 47:27.760
You men are raised with
an antiquated notion

47:27.760 --> 47:29.370
of what it is to be a woman

47:29.370 --> 47:31.620
and you take that with
you everywhere you go.

47:33.576 --> 47:34.950
- Do you secretly hate men?

47:34.950 --> 47:36.320
- No.

47:36.320 --> 47:37.570
Not all of you.

47:37.570 --> 47:40.860
I do love my dad and
my brother very dearly.

47:40.860 --> 47:41.693

47:41.693 --> 47:45.140
when I see a woman like
that with a body like that

47:45.140 --> 47:47.393
walking down the street dressed like that?

47:49.170 --> 47:51.296
- She's liberated.

47:52.129 --> 47:53.080
- Now you said liberated.

47:53.080 --> 47:54.840
Come on, I don't want
that kind of liberation

47:54.840 --> 47:56.250
for my daughter.

47:56.250 --> 47:58.070

And the only way you're
gonna be able to do that

48:02.570 --> 48:04.467
is if you open up your mind

48:04.467 --> 48:06.310
and start forming your own opinions

48:06.310 --> 48:08.570
instead of carrying on these antiquated

51:03.113 --> 51:04.097
- Damn.

51:04.097 --> 51:06.020
- What's the matter?

51:06.020 --> 51:07.320
- Another rejection email.

51:09.520 --> 51:12.340
- How many travel sites did you submit to?

51:12.340 --> 51:13.720
- A lot.

51:13.720 --> 51:14.920
- How many rejected you?

51:15.780 --> 51:17.403
- 100%.

51:18.960 --> 51:20.580
- You sent the guy you met from VICE TV

51:20.580 --> 51:21.880
the links to your documentaries

51:21.880 --> 51:23.730
from Morocco and Brazil, right?

51:23.730 --> 51:26.010
They may call you. You never know.

51:26.010 --> 51:27.800
- They ain't gonna call me.

51:27.800 --> 51:30.610
- Stop with your negative energy.

51:30.610 --> 51:31.443
- Got it.

51:35.382 --> 51:38.227
- I think I'm gonna make you some dinner.

51:39.810 --> 51:41.033
That'll change your mood.

51:47.314 --> 51:49.710
- Ooh, okay, okay.

51:49.710 --> 51:51.650
Ooh, this looks good.

51:51.650 --> 51:52.550
- I would hope so.

51:53.506 --> 51:55.308
- Have a seat.

51:55.308 --> 51:56.141
- Thanks.

51:56.141 --> 51:58.499
- All right, let's pray before we eat.

51:58.499 --> 51:59.932
- Okay.

51:59.932 --> 52:02.150
- Lord, thank you for this
food we're about to receive,

52:02.150 --> 52:03.760
bless the hands that prepared it,

52:03.760 --> 52:05.670
and may it nourish our
body for Christ's sake.

52:05.670 --> 52:06.640
Amen.

52:06.640 --> 52:07.473
- Amen.

52:08.870 --> 52:10.143
Let me know how it tastes.

52:10.143 --> 52:11.726
- Oh, I'm about to.

52:15.020 --> 52:16.290
Mm, mm, Monet.

52:18.794 --> 52:20.222
Mm-mm.

52:20.222 --> 52:21.143
This is good.

52:21.143 --> 52:23.070
This is really, really good.

52:23.070 --> 52:24.463
- Yeah?

52:24.463 --> 52:25.296
-
Think it's time to hear

52:25.296 --> 52:27.574
your wife's secret confession.

52:27.574 --> 52:29.698
Julia, we came here today
to tell your husband-

52:29.698 --> 52:31.260
- I want you to go to church with me.

52:31.260 --> 52:32.600
- Where do you go to church?

52:32.600 --> 52:34.222
- Mount Calvary.

52:34.222 --> 52:36.090
- Yeah, I know exactly where that is.

52:36.090 --> 52:37.220
Matter of fact,

52:37.220 --> 52:38.710
I visited there a couple times

52:38.710 --> 52:40.700
before I decided to stop going to church.

52:40.700 --> 52:42.000
- Why'd you stop going to church?

52:42.000 --> 52:44.340
- Just kind of felt like I
was going through the motions.

52:44.340 --> 52:45.520
I mean, in the middle of the sermon,

52:45.520 --> 52:46.910
everybody's jumping up and down.

52:46.910 --> 52:48.667
I'm sitting back wondering

52:48.667 --> 52:50.476
"When's the Falcon game start?"

52:50.476 --> 52:52.340
- Oh my God. You are terrible.

52:52.340 --> 52:54.500
- When we first started
going, I really liked it.

52:54.500 --> 52:55.333
And I've...

52:57.180 --> 52:59.330
- Oh, so you went to
church for some chick.

53:03.450 --> 53:04.991
So what happened to the chick

53:04.991 --> 53:07.282
you used to go to church with?

53:07.282 --> 53:08.115
- I don't know.

53:08.115 --> 53:09.090
She's around, I guess.

53:09.090 --> 53:10.376
- She's around, you guess?

53:10.376 --> 53:12.560
- You don't see
me diving on my phone

53:12.560 --> 53:13.840
every time it rings, do you?

53:13.840 --> 53:15.790
- Well, your phone's always on vibrate.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.390
- How do you know that?

53:21.512 --> 53:24.270
- I picked it up one time by mistake.

53:24.270 --> 53:25.690
- By mistake.

53:25.690 --> 53:26.683
- Yeah.

53:28.230 --> 53:29.640
- Where was I at?

53:29.640 --> 53:30.890
- You were in the shower.

53:34.580 --> 53:35.830
What?

53:35.830 --> 53:36.990
Why are you so nervous?

53:36.990 --> 53:38.540
What can I even do?

53:38.540 --> 53:40.890
It's not like you're my
man or anything, right?

53:44.370 --> 53:47.010
- True, true.

53:47.010 --> 53:49.503
But I still don't see why
you feel the need to check.

53:49.503 --> 53:51.080
I mean, you can ask me anything.

53:51.080 --> 53:52.930
I'll answer it honestly.

53:52.930 --> 53:54.030
- You're right.

53:54.030 --> 53:54.950
I am so sorry.

53:54.950 --> 53:56.815
I will never do that again.

53:58.400 --> 53:59.997
- Yeah, right.

53:59.997 --> 54:01.230
- I'm not like that.

54:01.230 --> 54:04.060
If I gotta check up on you,
I'm gone like the wind.

54:04.060 --> 54:04.893
Believe me.

54:06.870 --> 54:08.707

54:58.840 --> 54:59.798
It's not even like that.

54:59.798 --> 55:01.180
I have to get up in the morning.

55:01.180 --> 55:02.170
- No, I understand,

55:02.170 --> 55:05.210
but I don't see why you just can't stay.

55:05.210 --> 55:06.043

55:06.043 --> 55:07.040
Go home in the morning.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.800

55:08.800 --> 55:12.000
I have a client at 7:00 AM,

55:12.000 --> 55:15.375
so I need to get it together tonight.

55:19.800 --> 55:20.633
What?

55:23.470 --> 55:24.303
- Nothing really.

55:24.303 --> 55:26.298
We can talk about it tomorrow.

55:26.298 --> 55:28.298
- What are you thinking?

55:32.090 --> 55:35.025
- Like you said, you gotta go

55:35.025 --> 55:36.763
and it's no big deal, I'm serious.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.230
- Okay, but I'm here now.

55:39.230 --> 55:40.090
So tell me.

55:42.388 --> 55:44.275
- Struck out 41

55:44.275 --> 55:47.149
and his 26th inning is pitched

55:47.149 --> 55:49.303
giving up 12 hits in the process.

55:49.303 --> 55:51.823
- You know, I'm really glad I met you.

55:52.927 --> 55:55.380
- I'm really glad I met you too.

55:55.380 --> 55:56.660
You're so sweet.

55:56.660 --> 55:57.940
- Sweet?

55:57.940 --> 55:59.350
What? Quit playing!

55:59.350 --> 56:03.060
What about sexy, strong, intelligent?

56:03.060 --> 56:03.893
- Okay!

56:03.893 --> 56:07.711
- And not to mention, a
machine in bed.

56:07.711 --> 56:11.357
- All of that, all of that.

56:13.820 --> 56:16.250
- Do you remember when
we were talking earlier

56:16.250 --> 56:17.760
and you asked me whose idea it was

56:17.760 --> 56:19.672
to go to the church I was attending?

56:19.672 --> 56:21.089
- Mm-hmm.

56:25.109 --> 56:27.850
- I wanna be honest with you.

56:27.850 --> 56:31.160
- Jay, you don't
have to explain anything

56:31.160 --> 56:32.763
that happened in the past.

56:36.620 --> 56:38.240
- I was seeing someone

56:38.240 --> 56:40.583
and she got this great
job offer to New York.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.720
- You got a girlfriend?

56:42.720 --> 56:45.233
- No, we broke up before she left.

56:46.260 --> 56:49.383
- So why didn't you tell
me about this before?

56:50.710 --> 56:52.340
How long were you guys together?

56:52.340 --> 56:53.253
- Three years.

56:57.890 --> 57:00.374
- So why are you just now telling me this?

57:00.374 --> 57:01.890
- I don't want you to be upset.

57:01.890 --> 57:03.000
- The only reason why you would tell me

57:03.000 --> 57:05.750
about an ex-girlfriend is if
you're still in love with her

57:05.750 --> 57:07.980
or if you're lying to me

57:07.980 --> 57:08.813
and you're still with her.

57:08.813 --> 57:10.440
So which one is it?

57:10.440 --> 57:11.663
- We broke up.

57:15.630 --> 57:18.150
But she's coming home for Thanksgiving.

57:18.150 --> 57:18.983
- Home?

57:20.460 --> 57:21.650
Where's home? She live here?

57:21.650 --> 57:23.220
- No.

57:23.220 --> 57:24.120
She's from Atlanta.

57:24.120 --> 57:25.403
Her family lives here.

57:27.600 --> 57:30.590
- We just had this
discussion earlier today.

57:30.590 --> 57:33.340
Why didn't you tell me
about that then, huh?

57:33.340 --> 57:34.830
Because you wanted what you wanted tonight

57:34.830 --> 57:35.810
and you knew that you wouldn't get it

57:35.810 --> 57:38.003
if you were to tell me the truth, right?

57:38.900 --> 57:41.740
- No, I didn't plan
for it to go like this.

57:41.740 --> 57:42.573
- Yes, you did it.

57:42.573 --> 57:43.406
- Come on now.

57:43.406 --> 57:44.239
- Come on now?

57:45.920 --> 57:47.290
- Monet.

57:47.290 --> 57:48.173
- Here in
the bottom half of the first.

58:03.193 --> 58:04.657
- Hey!
- Hey, you.

58:04.657 --> 58:05.996
You look great. Come on in!

58:05.996 --> 58:07.692
- Thank you!

58:07.692 --> 58:08.600
I can't stay long.

58:08.600 --> 58:10.010
My ride is outside waiting.

58:10.010 --> 58:11.480
- Ride?

58:11.480 --> 58:12.870
Things must be working out for you.

58:12.870 --> 58:14.370
- Thanks to you.

58:14.370 --> 58:15.203
- Me?

58:15.203 --> 58:16.520
I mean, we haven't spoken in weeks.

58:16.520 --> 58:18.190
- And what about the video you did for me?

58:18.190 --> 58:20.730
- Oh, the video that all
of 100 people have seen?

58:20.730 --> 58:22.250
- Well, someone from
Safehouse Outreach saw it

58:22.250 --> 58:24.600
and when I applied for the position,

58:24.600 --> 58:26.520
they recognized me and
hired me on the spot.

58:26.520 --> 58:27.540
- What?
- Yes.

58:27.540 --> 58:28.930
I'm an assistant to the director.

58:28.930 --> 58:31.241
- Oh, that's
great. Congratulations!

58:31.241 --> 58:33.760
You deserve it!
- Thank you. Thank you.

58:33.760 --> 58:35.310
There's more, but I have to go.

58:36.300 --> 58:38.010
My director went to college with her

58:38.010 --> 58:39.120
and she saw the video

58:39.120 --> 58:41.010
and wants you to call her, okay?

58:41.010 --> 58:41.843
I gotta go.

58:41.843 --> 58:43.587
- All right. You keep doing good.

58:43.587 --> 58:44.502
- Thank you.

58:44.502 --> 58:46.051
Hey, listen. Let me know
how that goes, okay?

58:46.051 --> 58:47.801
- I will.
- All right.

59:22.172 --> 59:23.315
- May I?

59:23.315 --> 59:25.362
- Yeah, why would you ask?

59:25.362 --> 59:26.864
- Just checking.

59:26.864 --> 59:28.596
- Can I get you something to drink?

59:28.596 --> 59:29.544
- Do you have wine?

59:29.544 --> 59:30.532
- Of course.

59:30.532 --> 59:31.365
- I'll take that.

59:31.365 --> 59:32.698
- Be right back.

59:44.087 --> 59:44.920
Here you go.

59:44.920 --> 59:46.216
- Thank you.

59:46.216 --> 59:51.216
- So tell me all about New
York, this new job, all of it.

59:51.270 --> 59:53.393
- Brooklyn is lit.

59:54.300 --> 59:56.503
All the neighborhoods, and the people,

59:56.503 --> 59:58.410
like they're completely different,

59:58.410 --> 1:00:00.137
but they're all right
next door to each other.

1:00:00.137 --> 1:00:00.970
So, yeah.

1:00:00.970 --> 1:00:04.010
And the restaurants
and the cafes,

1:00:04.010 --> 1:00:05.520
But you spent time in Brooklyn.

1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:06.866
You know what I'm talking about.

1:00:06.866 --> 1:00:08.480
- Yeah, I always said
if I moved to New York,

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:10.120
I'd probably live in Brooklyn.

1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:12.582
- Oh, well, you had your opportunity.

1:00:14.671 --> 1:00:16.123
Anywho, how's your mother?

1:00:17.770 --> 1:00:19.190
- She's doing good.

1:00:19.190 --> 1:00:20.417
Matter of fact, she asked about you.

1:00:20.417 --> 1:00:22.660
- And what did you say?

1:00:22.660 --> 1:00:25.350
- I told her that you got a
great job offer in New York

1:00:25.350 --> 1:00:27.285
that you just couldn't refuse.

1:00:27.285 --> 1:00:28.830
- Did she ask you if we were together?

1:00:28.830 --> 1:00:30.882
- I told her that we keep
in contact, you know,

1:00:30.882 --> 1:00:32.820
and that we're still friends.

1:00:32.820 --> 1:00:34.080
- What, I've been gone for three months

1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:36.240
and we've only spoken like three times,

1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:38.090
today being included?

1:00:38.090 --> 1:00:40.930
I speak to my friends a little
bit more often than that.

1:00:40.930 --> 1:00:43.630
- Well, I have called
you, tried to text you,

1:00:43.630 --> 1:00:45.630
but if you don't respond, what can I do?

1:00:46.507 --> 1:00:48.603
- Do you do this for all your friends?

1:00:49.446 --> 1:00:51.312
- What?

1:00:51.312 --> 1:00:52.970
- This.

1:00:52.970 --> 1:00:56.410
The fireplace, the low lights,

1:00:56.410 --> 1:01:00.133
chilled wine, the soft music.

1:01:01.930 --> 1:01:04.800
- No, I don't do this for everyone.

1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:06.740
And as a matter of fact, I got a surprise.

1:01:06.740 --> 1:01:07.600
Now, listen, obviously-

1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:11.513
- Jay, I need to talk to
you about something else.

1:01:13.150 --> 1:01:13.983
To be honest with you,

1:01:13.983 --> 1:01:14.816
I was planning on taking this

1:01:14.816 --> 1:01:16.480
in a completely different direction.

1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:18.330
- Before we could even
talk about getting together

1:01:18.330 --> 1:01:20.353
or considering that, you
know we'd have to talk about-

1:01:20.353 --> 1:01:22.863
- Jay, I'm in love with someone else.

1:01:34.876 --> 1:01:36.950
- I don't know what I was expecting,

1:01:36.950 --> 1:01:39.043
but I know I wasn't expecting that.

1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:43.140
- I know I should
have said something,

1:01:43.140 --> 1:01:45.943
but I didn't wanna tell
you over the phone,

1:01:46.780 --> 1:01:49.580
even though I don't think
that you deserve the courtesy.

1:01:50.850 --> 1:01:53.475
- Why wouldn't I deserve the courtesy?

1:01:53.475 --> 1:01:56.440
- I don't wanna go backwards here.

1:01:56.440 --> 1:01:59.640
I love him and he loves me.

1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:02.140
I didn't mean for this to
happen, but it just did.

1:02:03.220 --> 1:02:05.300
- You've been gone for
less than three months.

1:02:05.300 --> 1:02:07.600
How could you possibly have
fallen in love already?

1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:11.100
- I don't think you want me
to answer that, Jay, honestly.

1:02:11.100 --> 1:02:13.240
- Try me. Yeah, I would.

1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:16.400
- Well what he and I have
shared in three months,

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:19.513
you and I we never
experienced in three years.

1:02:23.050 --> 1:02:25.130
You and I, we had something.

1:02:25.130 --> 1:02:25.963
Yeah.

1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:27.930
But it wasn't...

1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:31.859
It wasn't what I have now.

1:02:31.859 --> 1:02:33.190
And what I have now

1:02:33.190 --> 1:02:35.880
is something that I need and I want.

1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:37.310
- That's bullshit, Sanaa.

1:02:37.310 --> 1:02:39.190
I know you and I know how you operate.

1:02:39.190 --> 1:02:41.440
Ain't no way you're gonna let some dude

1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:43.570
get that close to you so quickly.

1:02:43.570 --> 1:02:45.380
- We spent a lot of time together.

1:02:45.380 --> 1:02:47.260
Look, I fell in love with someone else.

1:02:47.260 --> 1:02:48.210
It happens.

1:02:48.210 --> 1:02:49.390
People fall in love.

1:02:49.390 --> 1:02:51.250
People fall out of love.

1:02:51.250 --> 1:02:53.290
- So, on your mama's life,

1:02:53.290 --> 1:02:55.580
you gonna sit there and look me in my face

1:02:55.580 --> 1:02:57.750
and tell me that you done
fell in love with some cat

1:02:57.750 --> 1:02:59.100
in less than three months?

1:02:59.100 --> 1:03:02.410
- Okay, we met before I moved, but like,

1:03:02.410 --> 1:03:04.190
it wasn't anything, okay?

1:03:04.190 --> 1:03:05.803
It wasn't anything.
- Where'd you meet him?

1:03:07.110 --> 1:03:08.160
- Does it make a difference?

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:08.993
- I mean, you might as well tell me.

1:03:08.993 --> 1:03:10.290
I don't see why you feel the need

1:03:10.290 --> 1:03:11.640
to lie to me at this point.

1:03:13.410 --> 1:03:15.710
- I met him while I was working here.

1:03:15.710 --> 1:03:17.890
He came to the Atlanta office for work

1:03:17.890 --> 1:03:20.700
and, I mean, that's when I met him

1:03:20.700 --> 1:03:22.950
but we didn't go out or anything, okay?

1:03:22.950 --> 1:03:24.200
- But he had your number.

1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:27.100
- I mean, we would talk about work.

1:03:27.100 --> 1:03:28.573
I mean, that was it.

1:03:29.770 --> 1:03:30.603
- Wait a minute.

1:03:31.810 --> 1:03:33.460
Is this the guy who told you

1:03:33.460 --> 1:03:36.030

I needed to hit the streets.

1:04:15.290 --> 1:04:16.850
I figured I hit a club and chill

- I told you.

1:06:22.602 --> 1:06:25.400
I was just doing some
driving around thinking

1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:27.140
and I ran out of gas.

1:06:27.140 --> 1:06:29.550

1:06:29.550 --> 1:06:31.850

down there at that time.

1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:39.333
- What?

1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:45.310
- So the next time you have an argument

1:06:45.310 --> 1:06:46.143

1:06:46.143 --> 1:06:47.950
why don't you try driving around Buckhead

1:06:47.950 --> 1:06:51.040

1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:52.040
- All right.

1:06:58.285 --> 1:07:00.200
- I'm gonna get this filled for you.

1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:01.920

1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:02.753

1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:12.410

see Jay for a minute.

1:07:12.410 --> 1:07:14.727
- Sure, come on in.
- Thank you.

1:07:14.727 --> 1:07:16.317
- Close this door.

1:07:16.317 --> 1:07:17.150
- Thank you.

1:07:17.150 --> 1:07:18.060
- I'm Jay's Uncle Tony.

1:07:18.060 --> 1:07:19.710
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you also.

1:07:19.710 --> 1:07:20.740
He's right in here.

1:07:28.580 --> 1:07:29.413
- Hey.

1:07:33.293 --> 1:07:34.870
- How are you feeling?

1:07:34.870 --> 1:07:36.390
- I'm all right.

1:07:36.390 --> 1:07:37.443
Just a concussion.

1:07:38.630 --> 1:07:40.130
- Jay, I can see you're in good hands.

1:07:40.130 --> 1:07:42.910
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna take off.

1:07:42.910 --> 1:07:43.810
It was nice meeting you.

1:07:43.810 --> 1:07:44.900
- Nice meeting you too.

1:07:44.900 --> 1:07:45.760
- Thanks, Unc.

1:07:47.540 --> 1:07:49.427
So thanks for coming by.

1:07:49.427 --> 1:07:50.840
You wanna have a seat

1:07:50.840 --> 1:07:52.563
or I can take your coat, you know?

1:07:54.263 --> 1:07:55.763
- No, I'm not gonna stay long.

1:07:58.130 --> 1:07:59.188
I just came by to check on you

1:07:59.188 --> 1:08:00.738
and see if you needed anything.

1:08:02.190 --> 1:08:03.390
- I'm all right.

1:08:04.371 --> 1:08:05.204
- I have to be honest.

1:08:05.204 --> 1:08:06.160
I wasn't even sure I was gonna

1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:07.810
answer the phone when you called.

1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:16.493
I wasn't sure when you were
gonna hear from me again,

1:08:17.890 --> 1:08:20.130
but I could tell from
the sound of your voice

1:08:20.130 --> 1:08:21.730
that something was really wrong.

1:08:23.410 --> 1:08:24.603
Do you need anything?

1:08:25.460 --> 1:08:26.710
- I'm all right, I guess.

1:08:28.887 --> 1:08:31.087
- You need a
prescription filled or?

1:08:32.500 --> 1:08:34.550
- No, my uncle already took care of that.

1:08:36.250 --> 1:08:37.800
- Did you eat?

1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:38.633
- Yeah.

1:08:42.170 --> 1:08:44.960
- Okay, well, since you
don't need anything,

1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:45.810
I guess I'll just go.

1:08:45.810 --> 1:08:47.373
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:08:49.793 --> 1:08:51.930
I don't have everything I need.

1:08:51.930 --> 1:08:53.130
- What do you need, Jay?

1:08:58.840 --> 1:08:59.673
- You.

1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:04.360
- Moving women around like chess pieces

1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:06.893
for your enjoyment is not a need.

1:09:09.725 --> 1:09:11.683
- I wanted to be honest with you.

1:09:11.683 --> 1:09:13.850
I wanted to be sure I was over her

1:09:13.850 --> 1:09:15.360
before we went any further.

1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:17.100
- You come across as disingenuous

1:09:17.100 --> 1:09:18.740
and you talk about being honest

1:09:18.740 --> 1:09:21.103
after you intentionally
withheld the truth?

1:09:27.790 --> 1:09:30.743
All that matters is what Jay wants, right?

1:09:34.350 --> 1:09:35.183
- No.

1:09:36.890 --> 1:09:38.920
Just give me another opportunity, Monet.

1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:40.973
- No, I'm gone.

1:09:42.250 --> 1:09:43.083
- Monet.

1:10:00.290 --> 1:10:01.350
- Let's get started.

1:10:01.350 --> 1:10:03.570
All Texas licenses have to be renewed

1:10:03.570 --> 1:10:04.720

1:10:06.010 --> 1:10:08.030
I take it you all have the required

1:10:08.030 --> 1:10:10.051
continuing education hours.

1:10:12.062 --> 1:10:13.450
What is the problem?

1:10:13.450 --> 1:10:14.870
You're all professionals.

1:10:14.870 --> 1:10:16.570
Why do you wait till the last minute?

1:10:16.570 --> 1:10:18.490
- Some of us have families.

1:10:18.490 --> 1:10:20.770
- I assigned a time management module

1:10:20.770 --> 1:10:23.430
and to date none of
y'all have completed it.

1:10:23.430 --> 1:10:24.970
If you took your career seriously,

1:10:24.970 --> 1:10:25.980
you would have completed it

1:10:25.980 --> 1:10:27.963
and implemented but you aren't.

1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:30.820
- Why are you speaking
to us like we're kids?

1:10:30.820 --> 1:10:33.230
- Maybe because our
customer service results

1:10:33.230 --> 1:10:34.683
are the worst in the company.

1:10:36.090 --> 1:10:37.720
We get more home office complaints

1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:39.070
than any other region.

1:10:39.070 --> 1:10:42.660
And as result, I get a
call from the home office

1:10:42.660 --> 1:10:44.633
ripping me a new one on a weekly basis.

1:10:45.470 --> 1:10:46.710
- They send us questionnaires

1:10:46.710 --> 1:10:49.429
to one out of every 25 policy holders.

1:10:49.429 --> 1:10:50.490
- It doesn't matter.

1:10:50.490 --> 1:10:52.550
Our results are the worst in the company.

1:10:52.550 --> 1:10:53.980
- You know, I got one of those last week

1:10:53.980 --> 1:10:57.500
from a guy who totaled
out a 2002 Ford F150.

1:10:57.500 --> 1:11:00.320
We had the value at $6,350,

1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:02.390
but he valued it $15,000

1:11:02.390 --> 1:11:04.540
because he put a new set of tires on it

1:11:04.540 --> 1:11:06.410
and he got a brand new paint job.

1:11:06.410 --> 1:11:07.940
So what do you think he's gonna say

1:11:07.940 --> 1:11:10.080
when somebody asks him about his claim?

1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:11.210
- You're not the only one

1:11:11.210 --> 1:11:13.870
that settles total losses.

1:11:13.870 --> 1:11:14.703
Let me repeat.

1:11:14.703 --> 1:11:16.650
Our results are the worst in the company.

1:11:16.650 --> 1:11:17.483
Fix it.

1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:21.680
All right.

1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:23.080
Last thing.

1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:24.480
Take one and pass it down.

1:11:57.546 --> 1:12:00.400
As you can see, this
is a policy endorsement

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:02.890
that was effective the
first of last month.

1:12:02.890 --> 1:12:05.050
- So why are we just
hearing about this now?

1:12:05.050 --> 1:12:05.883
Based on this,

1:12:05.883 --> 1:12:07.400
I told somebody something
that wasn't true.

1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:08.950
We should have known about this.

1:12:08.950 --> 1:12:10.560
- We need to do what's required by-

1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:11.710
- Sharon, you just sat up in here

1:12:11.710 --> 1:12:14.020
and said we had issues
with customer service.

1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:16.030
So what does it say about customer service

1:12:16.030 --> 1:12:17.350
when we broaden the coverage

1:12:17.350 --> 1:12:19.683
but we can't tell them so
they can take advantage of it?

1:12:19.683 --> 1:12:21.926
- I just became aware of it myself.

1:12:21.926 --> 1:12:23.203
That's why we're having this meeting.

1:12:23.203 --> 1:12:24.740
- This is bullshit.

1:12:24.740 --> 1:12:25.680
- Watch your language.

1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:26.870
- You know, you bring us in here

1:12:26.870 --> 1:12:28.610
and tell us how poorly
of a job we're doing

1:12:28.610 --> 1:12:30.350
like we're supposed to sit
up in here and take it.

1:12:30.350 --> 1:12:31.507
It's insulting.

1:12:31.507 --> 1:12:32.573
- It sounds like an intentional move

1:12:32.573 --> 1:12:34.591
from the executive office to me.

1:12:34.591 --> 1:12:35.743
- It wasn't.

1:12:35.743 --> 1:12:37.480
- You know, if the insurance
department found out,

1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:39.370
we could get hit with a pretty heavy fine

1:12:39.370 --> 1:12:41.870
or maybe even be prevented
from writing the policies.

1:12:41.870 --> 1:12:43.790
This is a big effin' deal.

1:12:43.790 --> 1:12:45.903
- It is not our job to worry about it.

1:12:46.830 --> 1:12:47.730
That's all I have.

1:12:59.460 --> 1:13:01.060
- I'm taking a leave of absence.

1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:03.242
- This is a joke, right?

1:13:03.242 --> 1:13:04.440
- No.

1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:05.360
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:07.260
You just got back from vacation.

1:13:07.260 --> 1:13:09.220
- And I'm taking a leave of absence.

1:13:09.220 --> 1:13:11.133
- You got a set on you, you know that?

1:13:12.150 --> 1:13:14.300
Meet me in the conference
room after lunch.

1:13:23.210 --> 1:13:25.210
I said in the conference room after lunch.

1:13:25.210 --> 1:13:26.043
What part of that do you not-

1:13:26.043 --> 1:13:27.870
- I've worked here for nine years

1:13:27.870 --> 1:13:29.210
as a senior claims specialist.

1:13:29.210 --> 1:13:31.730
I even interned two summers
here when I was in college.

1:13:31.730 --> 1:13:34.400
I've gone along with the
changes this company has made

1:13:34.400 --> 1:13:36.390
in an effort to keep up
with our competitors.

1:13:36.390 --> 1:13:37.223
And you know what?

1:13:37.223 --> 1:13:39.280
You owe me nine years and two summers.

1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:42.240
Because the arrogance
displayed by this company

1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:44.110
is only eclipsed by the absurdity

1:13:44.110 --> 1:13:46.320
and selfishness of its decision making.

1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:47.300
And you know what?

1:13:47.300 --> 1:13:49.260
I fear that it's contagious

1:13:49.260 --> 1:13:51.980
and that I've taken years off my life

1:13:51.980 --> 1:13:54.260
by breathing the air that
circulates in this building.

1:13:54.260 --> 1:13:55.900
So you know what?

1:13:55.900 --> 1:13:58.550
I'm not giving you a two
weeks notice because I quit.

1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:03.033
- Yo, where are you going?

1:14:03.033 --> 1:14:04.280
- I'm out, Steve.

1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:05.230
I'll call you, man.

1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:02.970
It's amazing what you
see when you slow down

1:15:04.427 --> 1:15:07.573
and just allow yourself to be.

1:16:14.690 --> 1:16:17.630
- What motivated you to tell this story?

1:16:17.630 --> 1:16:20.150
- Well, I can tell you
that it wasn't planned.

1:16:20.150 --> 1:16:23.220
I actually was headed
into a convenience store.

1:16:23.220 --> 1:16:26.780
It had already been a
long day and I was tired.

1:16:26.780 --> 1:16:27.613
And you know how it is,

1:16:27.613 --> 1:16:29.653
I wasn't exactly in the best of moods.

1:16:30.750 --> 1:16:33.510
And I was about to head
into the convenience store

1:16:33.510 --> 1:16:36.360
and this young woman just approached me.

1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:37.930
That meeting turned into a job

1:16:37.930 --> 1:16:40.570
producing special projects for CNN.

1:16:40.570 --> 1:16:42.820
Don't ignore that little
voice in your head.

1:16:42.820 --> 1:16:44.800
That's your conscience talking to you.

1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:46.430
Once you realize that,

1:16:46.430 --> 1:16:47.910
the next step is to figure out

1:16:47.910 --> 1:16:49.217
what you're supposed to do

1:16:49.217 --> 1:16:51.400
and how you're supposed to do it.

1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:53.990
I like to write and document what I see.

1:16:53.990 --> 1:16:55.050
I wanna do that in a way

1:16:55.050 --> 1:16:57.130
that informs and helps other people

1:16:57.130 --> 1:16:58.120
because in the end,

1:16:58.120 --> 1:17:00.310
helping other people is all that matters.
