00:06.202 --> 00:08.203
Air and naval
forces of the United States

00:08.205 --> 00:11.172
launched a series of strikes
against terrorist facilities...

00:11.174 --> 00:13.208
Pan Am flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.

00:13.210 --> 00:14.542
He has sanctioned
acts of terror

00:14.544 --> 00:17.212
in Africa, Europe and
the Middle East.

00:17.214 --> 00:19.881
This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.

00:19.883 --> 00:21.549
This relentless
pursuit of terror.

00:21.551 --> 00:23.384
We will make no distinction...

00:23.386 --> 00:24.819
The USS Cole was attacked

00:24.821 --> 00:26.054
while refueling in
the port of Aden.

00:26.056 --> 00:27.989
This was an act of terrorism.

00:27.991 --> 00:30.425
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:30.427 --> 00:32.894
The next samba
we're going to swing for you

00:32.896 --> 00:34.062
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:34.064 --> 00:36.564
...until something stops him.

00:36.566 --> 00:39.400
It was right
in front of my eyes,

00:39.402 --> 00:41.069
and I never saw it coming.

00:41.071 --> 00:44.105
That plane crashed
into the World Trade Center.

00:44.107 --> 00:46.608
Thousands of people running.

00:46.610 --> 00:50.578
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:56.452 --> 00:58.686
You're the smartest
and the dumbest fucking person

00:58.688 --> 01:00.922
I've ever known.

01:00.924 --> 01:02.457
I'm not the
one who got it wrong.

01:02.459 --> 01:04.659
I'm the only one
who got it right.

01:08.430 --> 01:10.365
Take 'em.

01:10.367 --> 01:12.166
Take 'em all.

01:19.469 --> 01:22.563
Homeland - 3x05
"The Yoga Play"

01:24.246 --> 01:26.013
Previously on Homeland...

01:26.015 --> 01:27.415
He's not good for you.

01:27.417 --> 01:30.084
And that is based on what,
not knowing him at all?

01:30.086 --> 01:31.118
He's unstable.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.287
Dana?

01:33.289 --> 01:35.256
Mom, what happened?

01:35.258 --> 01:36.958
Your sister's gone.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.693
Go.

01:38.695 --> 01:40.728
It's not an official
missing persons for 24 hours.

01:40.730 --> 01:42.129
The state police have
a description,

01:42.131 --> 01:44.131
and they're aware that Leo
is a fugitive from here.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.700
Leo wasn't in the rehab facility
for treatment.

01:45.702 --> 01:47.468
His parents made a deal
with the DA

01:47.470 --> 01:49.904
to keep him from being charged
with a homicide.

01:49.906 --> 01:53.074
It's beyond argument
that the Agency is now crippled

01:53.076 --> 01:55.109
and its reputation in tatters.

01:55.111 --> 01:58.212
How can the CIA be expected
to protect this country

01:58.214 --> 02:00.448
if it can't even protect itself?

02:00.450 --> 02:01.482
It's Carrie.

02:01.484 --> 02:03.584
She's out for blood, Saul.

02:03.586 --> 02:06.754
I just wanted you to know
I'm gonna stop her.

02:06.756 --> 02:08.489
Your client,
in her current state of mind,

02:08.491 --> 02:10.390
poses a threat
to national security.

02:10.393 --> 02:12.593
Un-fucking-believable.

02:13.995 --> 02:15.630
Carrie?

02:15.632 --> 02:16.831
You're out.

02:16.833 --> 02:18.399
I'm out?

02:18.401 --> 02:20.301
We went to a lot of trouble
to get you out of that hospital.

02:20.303 --> 02:21.769
In exchange for?

02:21.771 --> 02:24.138
A sit-down with one of
the partners in the firm.

02:24.140 --> 02:25.640
Our firm has
longstanding relationships

02:25.642 --> 02:28.643
with several countries
in the Middle East.

02:28.645 --> 02:30.244
What does your client want?

02:30.246 --> 02:32.980
Well, he recently lost
six business associates.

02:32.982 --> 02:36.017
So this is Iran
we're talking about.

02:36.019 --> 02:37.818
Javadi?

02:37.820 --> 02:40.154
He ordered the attack
on this building.

02:40.156 --> 02:41.622
I need him in a room.

02:41.624 --> 02:43.858
I want to rip him
down to the studs.

02:43.860 --> 02:47.094
I will see your client,
but only him,

02:47.096 --> 02:48.729
and only face-to-face.

02:50.432 --> 02:52.767
It worked, Saul.

02:52.769 --> 02:55.169
Javadi.

02:55.171 --> 02:57.171
It has to be.

02:57.173 --> 03:00.374
Did you hold out for
a meeting in person?

03:03.145 --> 03:06.213
You've been very, very brave.

03:06.215 --> 03:08.516
You should've gotten me
out of the hospital, Saul.

03:08.518 --> 03:10.918
You shouldn't have left me
in there.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074

03:19.027 --> 03:21.095
Hello.

03:23.198 --> 03:26.200
What's the purpose of your visit
to the United States, Mr. Zarin?

03:26.202 --> 03:27.334
Business.

03:27.336 --> 03:28.669
What sort of business?

03:28.671 --> 03:29.704
Uh, paper products.

03:29.706 --> 03:32.206
Oh, I'm visiting clients
in Albany.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.675
I thought I'd take
the scenic route.

03:34.677 --> 03:36.544
How long will you be
in the States?

03:36.546 --> 03:38.946
Maximum three days.

03:44.319 --> 03:46.053
Enjoy your stay.

03:46.055 --> 03:48.122
Thanks very much.

03:53.628 --> 03:56.726
_

04:03.071 --> 04:04.739
Yes?

04:04.741 --> 04:06.507
I'm Peter Quinn;
Saul called me.

04:06.509 --> 04:08.242
Come in. I'm Mira.

04:08.244 --> 04:09.877
Saul's just getting dressed.

04:09.879 --> 04:11.512
What as?

04:11.514 --> 04:12.580
Hey.

04:12.582 --> 04:14.248
He's going duck hunting.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.616
And why would he do that?

04:15.618 --> 04:18.185
The President's
Chief of Staff invited him

04:18.187 --> 04:21.088
and half the Senate Committee
on Intelligence.

04:21.089 --> 04:23.057
They're gonna talk to him
about the permanent job.

04:23.059 --> 04:25.259
Director of the CIA.

04:25.261 --> 04:27.595
Better not screw it up.

04:27.597 --> 04:29.230
That's what Mira
keeps telling me.

04:29.232 --> 04:31.532
How do I look?

04:31.534 --> 04:33.434
If I was a duck, I'd be worried.

04:34.904 --> 04:37.138
I'll make some coffee.

04:40.075 --> 04:42.109
Come here.

04:46.615 --> 04:48.582
I need your eyes on Carrie.

04:48.584 --> 04:50.951
Carrie? Why?

04:50.953 --> 04:54.088
Because the Iranians
are watching her, too.

04:54.090 --> 04:55.790
For what reason?

04:55.792 --> 04:58.292
They believe she's a
disgraced CIA officer,

04:58.294 --> 05:00.461
desperate enough
to sell information.

05:00.463 --> 05:02.296
No, that's crazy.
Carrie would never

05:02.298 --> 05:04.031
- in a million years...
- But she would.

05:05.801 --> 05:09.103
'Cause that was the play.

05:09.105 --> 05:11.672
We dangled her to draw
the Iranians out.

05:13.608 --> 05:15.643
"Dangled"?
What are you talking about?

05:15.645 --> 05:19.413
I'm inviting you into an
ongoing operation, Peter.

05:19.415 --> 05:21.215
Carrie's and mine.

05:23.585 --> 05:25.653
You mean...

05:26.788 --> 05:29.857
burning her
in front of the Senate?

05:29.859 --> 05:31.992
Committing her
to a mental institution?

05:31.994 --> 05:33.594
All an act.

05:33.596 --> 05:35.362
Part of the plan.

05:37.299 --> 05:38.666
Fuck me.

05:39.936 --> 05:41.669
And it's working?

05:41.671 --> 05:43.003
So far.

05:43.005 --> 05:45.039
Two nights ago,

05:45.041 --> 05:47.808
the Deputy Chief of Iran's
Intelligence Directorate

05:47.810 --> 05:49.443
took the bait.

05:49.445 --> 05:51.812
We believe he's
on his way here.

05:51.814 --> 05:53.948
Javadi himself?

05:53.950 --> 05:56.383
Majid Javadi?

05:56.385 --> 05:58.552
He's taking a huge fucking risk.

05:58.554 --> 06:01.755
Carrie Mathison's
a huge fucking draw.

06:59.115 --> 07:01.081
English, please.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.549
The tank is full.

07:02.551 --> 07:06.020
There's a credit card
and some dollars.

07:06.022 --> 07:07.922
Okay.

07:07.924 --> 07:10.124
Do you want a weapon?
Sig Sauer 250?

07:10.126 --> 07:12.192
No guns.

07:14.029 --> 07:15.763
I've programmed
the directions, sir.

07:15.765 --> 07:17.264
Thank you.

07:27.275 --> 07:30.945
So, I have $74.58 left.

07:30.947 --> 07:32.446
And you?

07:32.448 --> 07:34.415
Zip. Nada.

07:34.417 --> 07:36.483
You forget, I come from
a money-free zone.

07:36.485 --> 07:38.953
So we have enough
for another tank of gas

07:38.955 --> 07:41.889
and a few days of food,
and then...

07:41.891 --> 07:44.158
Despair, starvation, death.

07:46.329 --> 07:49.129
As long as I'm with you.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.635
We could find somewhere,
though, you know?

07:54.637 --> 07:56.437
Somewhere where nobody knows us.

07:56.439 --> 07:58.105
Get a place,

07:58.107 --> 07:59.306
get jobs.

07:59.308 --> 08:00.741
Flipping burgers?

08:00.743 --> 08:03.811
Hell, I mean, I'd flip burgers.

08:03.813 --> 08:05.980
I'm just saying,

08:05.982 --> 08:08.482
we don't have to be who we are.

08:08.484 --> 08:10.184
Not forever.

08:10.186 --> 08:11.652
We can escape it.

08:11.654 --> 08:13.320
You think people would let us?

08:13.322 --> 08:15.622
Your family, my family?

08:15.624 --> 08:17.558
All the bullshit?

08:19.527 --> 08:21.161
Hey.

08:21.163 --> 08:23.297
We got to enjoy what we've got,

08:23.299 --> 08:25.666
because it will never
get better than this.

08:25.668 --> 08:27.501
Here and now,

08:27.503 --> 08:30.504
you and me, all right?

08:35.010 --> 08:35.708
Shit!

08:36.979 --> 08:38.011
Jesus.

08:38.014 --> 08:39.446
- Sorry.
- Leo.

08:39.448 --> 08:41.248
Sorry.

08:43.719 --> 08:45.886
I was looking at you.

09:00.168 --> 09:02.169
Jessica?

09:02.171 --> 09:03.937
I'm sorry, I...

09:05.974 --> 09:08.042
Dana's missing.

09:08.044 --> 09:10.577
Uh, c-come in.

09:13.381 --> 09:14.548
I know it's not appropriate

09:14.550 --> 09:16.216
for me to just turn up
like this.

09:16.218 --> 09:18.385
I-I literally have
nowhere else to go.

09:18.387 --> 09:20.721
What do you mean,
Dana's missing?

09:20.723 --> 09:22.189
She disappeared three days ago.

09:22.191 --> 09:24.892
She stole my car
and she broke her boyfriend

09:24.894 --> 09:26.527
out of the clinic where she...

09:26.529 --> 09:29.396
I don't know how much you know,
but Dana tried to kill herself.

09:29.398 --> 09:31.532
Yes, I know, I know.

09:31.534 --> 09:33.333
Have you gone to the police?

09:33.335 --> 09:34.902
They say they're looking,

09:34.904 --> 09:37.337
but it's obvious they think
it's just two kids on a joyride.

09:37.339 --> 09:38.505
The FBI?

09:38.507 --> 09:39.773
They say it's not
their jurisdiction.

09:39.775 --> 09:43.744
Well, m-maybe it is
just kids on a joyride.

09:43.746 --> 09:45.112
Even if it is, I'm worried.

09:45.114 --> 09:47.181
I found out
why Leo was in the clinic.

09:47.183 --> 09:50.717
His parents put him there
to avoid a homicide charge.

09:50.719 --> 09:52.386
He killed someone?

09:52.388 --> 09:54.054
His little brother
ended up dead,

09:54.056 --> 09:55.756
killed with the family gun.

09:55.758 --> 09:57.458
Maybe it was an accident,

09:57.460 --> 09:59.893
maybe Leo's a psychopath,
I don't know.

09:59.895 --> 10:01.228
I don't know what Dana knows,

10:01.230 --> 10:02.629
- and I'm scared.
- Dana's a bright girl.

10:02.631 --> 10:04.431
- She'll see through him.
- Dana's in love.

10:04.433 --> 10:05.799
Who knows what she'll see?

10:07.436 --> 10:08.902
Look, I'm sorry,

10:08.904 --> 10:11.105
but this is a really
bad time for me.

10:11.107 --> 10:12.639
I-I'm not in
a position...

10:12.641 --> 10:14.241
You tried to help us
once before.

10:14.243 --> 10:16.610
You turned up to my house,

10:16.612 --> 10:18.946
and you tried to warn me
about Brody.

10:18.948 --> 10:20.948
And even though I knew
in my heart

10:20.950 --> 10:23.484
something was seriously
fucking wrong, I didn't listen.

10:23.486 --> 10:26.487
And I know something's
wrong now. I know it.

10:26.489 --> 10:29.256
And I'm begging you,
please help me find her.

10:29.258 --> 10:31.658
- Please.
- Okay, okay.

10:31.660 --> 10:34.294
Thank you.

10:34.296 --> 10:37.464
Look, go home, and
I'll see what I can do.

10:37.466 --> 10:39.700
Thank you.

11:14.003 --> 11:15.502
Yes?

11:15.504 --> 11:17.337
Agent Hall,
it's Carrie Mathison.

11:17.339 --> 11:18.972
I need to talk.

11:18.974 --> 11:20.641
I got nothing to say to you.

11:20.643 --> 11:22.509
This is about Dana Brody.

11:22.511 --> 11:24.278
I don't care what it's about,
Mathison.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.979
Don't call me again.

11:25.981 --> 11:27.514
Fucking Brody.

12:03.318 --> 12:04.551
Yeah?

12:04.553 --> 12:06.420
Hey, Max, it's Carrie.

12:06.422 --> 12:08.222
Carrie.

12:08.224 --> 12:09.556
Uh...

12:09.558 --> 12:10.657
Carrie, where are you?

12:10.659 --> 12:12.025
In ten seconds,
I'm gonna call you back

12:12.027 --> 12:13.026
and set up the yoga play.

12:13.028 --> 12:14.261
Yoga?

12:14.263 --> 12:15.862
Virgil's yoga play, using Lisa.

12:15.864 --> 12:17.064
Remember? So when I call,

12:17.066 --> 12:19.233
act a little less clueless
than you are now, okay?

12:19.235 --> 12:20.934
Carrie, I'm not acting clueless.

12:20.936 --> 12:23.570
I was up all night
on a job, prep...

12:33.837 --> 12:36.099
_

12:45.961 --> 12:46.960
Hello.

12:46.962 --> 12:48.095
This is Max.

12:48.097 --> 12:49.263
Hey, Max, it's Carrie.

12:49.265 --> 12:50.430
I'm just, uh, calling to see

12:50.432 --> 12:51.765
if we're still on
for yoga this morning.

12:51.767 --> 12:53.033
Oh, yeah.

12:53.035 --> 12:54.101
Yeah, yoga.

12:54.103 --> 12:55.102
Sure, right.

12:55.104 --> 12:57.604
Class starts at 10:00, so...

12:57.606 --> 12:59.106
better get moving, okay?

12:59.108 --> 13:01.441
Okay.

13:06.414 --> 13:07.981
Target's on the move.

13:07.983 --> 13:09.850
Copy that.

13:21.963 --> 13:25.098
Jesus! What the fuck, Quinn?

13:25.100 --> 13:27.768
Shouldn't you be
hiding up a tree or something?

13:27.770 --> 13:29.136
I'm up on your burner phone.

13:29.138 --> 13:30.804
I heard your conversation
with Agent Hall

13:30.806 --> 13:32.105
and your little friend Max.

13:32.107 --> 13:34.574
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

13:34.576 --> 13:36.143
If you heard, you should know.

13:36.145 --> 13:37.444
I'm trying to find Dana Brody.

13:37.446 --> 13:38.779
You're gonna look
for her yourself?

13:38.781 --> 13:40.480
No, I'm gonna get
the FBI to do it.

13:40.482 --> 13:41.648
How are you gonna do that?

13:41.650 --> 13:43.817
The guy won't even talk to you.

13:43.819 --> 13:45.819
You came in on this operation,
like, five minutes ago,

13:45.821 --> 13:47.487
and now you're
telling me what to do?

13:47.489 --> 13:48.855
You have surveillance
all over you.

13:48.857 --> 13:50.657
Two teams, as far as I can see.

13:50.659 --> 13:52.626
They realize you're not
who you're supposed to be,

13:52.628 --> 13:53.660
they'll just kill you.

13:53.662 --> 13:55.095
They won't realize.
This play works.

13:55.097 --> 13:56.496
I've used it a dozen times.

13:56.498 --> 13:57.698
Well, you're still
risking the operation.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.366
Let me handle it.
I'll talk to the fed.

13:59.368 --> 14:00.600
No, I know the guy.

14:00.602 --> 14:01.668
He's just gonna
jerk you around.

14:01.670 --> 14:04.204
Carrie, you're under
a lot of strain.

14:04.206 --> 14:05.672
You're not thinking clearly.

14:05.674 --> 14:07.274
I'm thinking just fine, Quinn.

14:07.276 --> 14:09.009
If anyone's risking
this operation, it's you.

14:09.011 --> 14:10.544
You shouldn't be
anywhere near me.

14:14.682 --> 14:16.350
Look...

14:17.318 --> 14:19.019
I'm glad you've got my back.

14:19.021 --> 14:22.356
And... you came to see me

14:22.358 --> 14:25.525
in the hospital when I was
not in a good place.

14:25.527 --> 14:28.228
And... it meant a lot.

14:33.067 --> 14:36.703
What you put yourself through...

14:36.705 --> 14:39.239
it was fucking incredible.

14:43.344 --> 14:46.580
Yeah, well, I've got a yoga
class that starts in 11 minutes.

15:32.727 --> 15:34.394
Michael Higgins.

15:34.396 --> 15:36.596
I didn't know you went in
for this sort of thing.

15:36.598 --> 15:37.964
I don't.

15:37.966 --> 15:39.199
The President asks,

15:39.201 --> 15:41.101
his Chief of Staff delivers.

15:43.539 --> 15:45.305
You can dump your stuff here.

15:45.307 --> 15:47.441
They'll take it up
to your room for you.

15:47.443 --> 15:48.875
Okay, thanks.

15:53.614 --> 15:55.115
Now, we'll get some coffee.

15:55.117 --> 15:56.483
Unless you want
something stronger.

15:56.485 --> 15:57.918
No, coffee's fine. Black.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.820
Could we get
a black coffee here?

16:02.423 --> 16:05.158
Well, you should know, you've
won a lot of respect here

16:05.160 --> 16:08.295
with the operation
to take out the Langley bombers.

16:08.297 --> 16:10.130
Maybe I should've brought
their heads back on a spike.

16:10.132 --> 16:12.299
Hello, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.

16:12.301 --> 16:13.967
- Mike.
- Hey!

16:13.969 --> 16:16.670
Hope the White House can
survive without you for one day.

16:16.672 --> 16:18.171
Saul. How are you?

16:18.173 --> 16:19.272
I'm well, Senator.

16:19.274 --> 16:22.175
Where the hell is my Slivovitz?

16:22.177 --> 16:23.977
I got a taste for this

16:23.979 --> 16:26.046
when I was with KFOR in Kosovo.

16:28.449 --> 16:30.650
That burns away the cobwebs.

16:30.652 --> 16:31.818
You want one?

16:31.820 --> 16:33.987
Thanks,
I'm cobweb-free.

16:35.157 --> 16:36.790
You ever hunted geese before?

16:36.792 --> 16:38.492
No, just spies and traitors.

16:38.494 --> 16:40.160
Thought we were hunting duck.

16:40.162 --> 16:43.263
Duck season's long gone, Saul.

16:43.265 --> 16:44.931
Goose season's almost over, too.

16:44.933 --> 16:48.468
This is our last chance
to take down some big boys.

16:48.470 --> 16:49.803
It's good to meet

16:49.805 --> 16:52.305
in less adversarial
circumstances, isn't it?

17:18.534 --> 17:20.599
Hi, sorry.

17:24.405 --> 17:26.373
Hey, Lisa, I really
appreciate this.

17:26.375 --> 17:27.874
Yeah, you're lucky
I was in town.

17:27.876 --> 17:29.209
I know.
It was an emergency.

17:29.211 --> 17:30.377
Okay, the boys
are in the alley.

17:30.379 --> 17:32.445
Okay, I'll be back
before the class ends.

17:44.725 --> 17:46.159
Virgil.

17:46.161 --> 17:48.361
Classy move, Carrie, taking
advantage of my brother.

17:48.363 --> 17:49.596
What else could I do?

17:49.598 --> 17:51.097
Last time I called, you implied
you were being watched.

17:51.099 --> 17:52.699
Those goons backed off
two days ago.

17:52.701 --> 17:55.101
But I'm not kidding, we could
lose our jobs over this.

17:55.103 --> 17:56.236
I know, and I'm grateful,

17:56.238 --> 17:58.071
but can we talk
about this on the move?

17:58.073 --> 18:00.106
I'm on a really tight
time frame here.

18:00.108 --> 18:01.408
I have to get
to Bethesda and back

18:01.410 --> 18:03.310
in less than 50 minutes,
so can we move?

18:14.255 --> 18:16.756
I pulled rank and arranged
for us to share a hide.

18:16.758 --> 18:19.259
One of the few places you can
actually talk in private.

18:19.261 --> 18:20.260
Hope you don't mind.

18:20.262 --> 18:21.461
Not at all.

18:21.463 --> 18:23.697
Long as you don't expect me
to hit anything.

18:23.699 --> 18:25.265
Fired a shotgun recently?

18:25.267 --> 18:26.266
Not for 20 years.

18:26.268 --> 18:27.434
Happy hunting, boys!

18:27.436 --> 18:29.102
See you out there, Lonnie.

18:29.104 --> 18:30.270
Try my old remington.

18:30.272 --> 18:31.671
Never missed a shot.

18:32.873 --> 18:34.541
Come on, Rio, let's roll!

18:34.543 --> 18:36.610
Come on!

18:51.058 --> 18:52.592
10:42. Where is he?

18:52.594 --> 18:53.827
Does he always come here?

18:53.829 --> 18:55.128
Every morning.
I've watched him.

18:55.130 --> 18:57.430
He picks up his coffee sometime
between 10:30 and 10:45,

18:57.432 --> 19:00.300
then he drives to the Brody
house to do his shift.

19:00.302 --> 19:02.769
10:43. We're not
gonna make it back

19:02.771 --> 19:04.170
before that class ends.

19:04.172 --> 19:05.705
- We have to go, Carrie.
- We're staying.

19:08.677 --> 19:10.276
What is it
that you're working on?

19:10.278 --> 19:11.378
I said we're staying.

19:30.132 --> 19:31.131
Hi, there!

19:31.133 --> 19:33.199
Look what I got for you.

19:35.336 --> 19:37.404
I know, sweetheart, I know.

19:54.121 --> 19:56.022
Oh...

19:56.024 --> 19:58.258
Ugh.

20:24.051 --> 20:26.219
Agent Hall.

20:26.221 --> 20:28.254
Jesus.
You got nerve.

20:28.256 --> 20:30.156
- I'm not talking to you.
- This isn't about me.

20:30.158 --> 20:31.224
Dana Brody is missing.

20:31.226 --> 20:32.425
What are you doing
on the street, Mathison?

20:32.427 --> 20:34.227
Why aren't you in the nuthouse
where you belong?

20:34.229 --> 20:35.729
Do you have to be such a dick?

20:35.731 --> 20:38.031
Please. Dana's in
real trouble.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.933
- Her mother's going out of her mind.
- That's not my problem.

20:39.935 --> 20:41.568
How is that not your problem?

20:41.570 --> 20:43.403
What if her father's
still in the country?

20:43.405 --> 20:45.438
What if she's on her way
to meet him?

20:45.440 --> 20:47.540
She isn't.
She's also not in any trouble.

20:47.542 --> 20:49.209
- How do you know?
- Because.

20:49.211 --> 20:51.277
My guys have been
listening in on Dana

20:51.279 --> 20:52.746
and her boyfriend for weeks.

20:52.748 --> 20:55.415
This? It's two teenagers
run away on a fuck-fest.

20:55.417 --> 20:56.950
Romeo and Juliet.

20:56.952 --> 20:58.752
You do know how Romeo and
Juliet ends, don't you?

20:58.754 --> 20:59.753
Not well.

20:59.755 --> 21:01.521
Get over yourself, Mathison.

21:01.523 --> 21:02.522
They'll be home.

21:02.524 --> 21:03.923
Soon as the money runs out.

21:03.925 --> 21:06.059
Did you ever run background
on the boyfriend?

21:06.061 --> 21:08.962
If you did, you'd know
he's bad fucking news.

21:08.964 --> 21:10.930
I mean, even if you don't
give a shit about Dana,

21:10.932 --> 21:12.966
she is the one person
Brody will reach out to

21:12.968 --> 21:14.467
if he ever reaches
out to anybody.

21:14.469 --> 21:16.469
So please, tell me
you know where she is,

21:16.471 --> 21:18.438
tell me she's safe,
and then I'll walk away.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.241
Look, we got a BOLO
out to field offices,

21:21.243 --> 21:22.876
law enforcement
across the Northeast.

21:22.878 --> 21:24.611
- We're gonna find her.
- You better.

21:24.613 --> 21:26.146
Because if anything
happens to that girl,

21:26.148 --> 21:28.047
it's on you,
and I will make damn sure

21:28.049 --> 21:29.516
the whole world knows
you lost her.

21:58.312 --> 22:00.613
What the hell?

22:00.615 --> 22:03.283
Hey! Hey!

22:03.285 --> 22:04.317
Move your damn car!

22:04.319 --> 22:06.319
Oh, I just got to deliver this.

22:06.321 --> 22:07.954
I said move your fucking car.

22:07.956 --> 22:09.222
I'll be, like,
five seconds tops, I promise.

22:10.791 --> 22:12.625
Um... listen,

22:12.627 --> 22:14.627
you know where 1905-B is?

22:14.629 --> 22:15.995
'Cause I can see
1905-A, but...

22:15.997 --> 22:18.131
I should break your neck,
asshole.

22:18.133 --> 22:19.299
Hey, man, what's the hurry?

22:19.301 --> 22:22.168
Well, I guess
it's around back, but...

22:22.170 --> 22:24.304
- Take it easy.
- Thanks.

22:37.318 --> 22:38.785
Thank you.

22:49.163 --> 22:51.698
I spoke to
the President yesterday.

22:51.700 --> 22:52.699
He's concerned.

22:52.701 --> 22:54.367
About what?

22:54.369 --> 22:56.135
Morale.

22:56.137 --> 22:58.037
At the CIA, for one thing.

22:58.039 --> 23:00.807
In the wake of
the Langley bombing,

23:00.809 --> 23:02.809
and the revelations
about Carrie Mathison.

23:02.811 --> 23:05.011
Tell the President
not to worry.

23:05.013 --> 23:07.046
Morale is good.

23:07.048 --> 23:08.882
We're moving forward.

23:14.522 --> 23:16.756
You should also know he's...

23:16.758 --> 23:19.893
exploring some changes
in intelligence practice.

23:21.495 --> 23:24.397
The old games are proving
less and less effective.

23:24.399 --> 23:27.233
Obsolete, even.

23:27.235 --> 23:28.902
"The old games"?

23:28.904 --> 23:32.906
Certain categories of
clandestine operations.

23:32.908 --> 23:37.110
Double agents, coat-trailing,
stimulated defections.

23:37.112 --> 23:39.178
Live sources.

23:39.180 --> 23:41.514
Human beings.

23:41.516 --> 23:44.083
That's the gold standard
of espionage.

23:44.085 --> 23:46.586
They're also
the most unreliable.

23:46.588 --> 23:49.622
Two words, Nicholas Brody.

23:52.293 --> 23:54.761
Brody got past us.

23:54.763 --> 23:56.296
I'll admit that.

23:56.298 --> 23:58.398
Look, I'm not here
to beat you over the head,

23:58.400 --> 23:59.866
but the truth is,
where we've been

23:59.868 --> 24:01.434
most effective is militarily.

24:01.436 --> 24:02.936
The drone program alone...

24:02.938 --> 24:04.804
You can't run an
intelligence agency

24:04.806 --> 24:06.372
from 17,000 feet, Senator.

24:06.374 --> 24:08.241
No one is suggesting that.

24:08.243 --> 24:10.043
But with Al-Qaeda
seriously degraded,

24:10.045 --> 24:11.911
out biggest threat is now Iran.

24:11.913 --> 24:15.715
Military action at this point--

24:15.717 --> 24:17.884
be a huge mistake.

24:17.886 --> 24:21.454
The President wants
all options on the table, Saul.

24:21.456 --> 24:24.457
I'll do whatever it takes.

24:24.459 --> 24:26.059
But I won't temper my views

24:26.061 --> 24:28.695
just to get your support for
my confirmation as director.

24:33.268 --> 24:36.903
I'm afraid you've got
this backwards, old friend.

24:36.905 --> 24:39.839
I'm the one getting
nominated as director.

24:43.077 --> 24:44.978
What?

24:44.980 --> 24:49.148
The President's putting my name
up for confirmation tomorrow.

24:49.150 --> 24:51.918
So this really isn't about
tempering your views,

24:51.920 --> 24:53.486
it's about changing them.

24:53.488 --> 24:57.757
If, that is, you want a job...

24:57.759 --> 24:59.659
in my CIA.

25:01.596 --> 25:03.663
Your bird, I think.

25:32.292 --> 25:34.027
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

25:36.030 --> 25:37.797
Welcome, sir.
My name is Navid.

25:37.799 --> 25:39.499
This is Aram.
Your cases came yesterday.

25:39.501 --> 25:40.500
They're upstairs.

25:40.502 --> 25:41.768
Thank you.

25:44.838 --> 25:47.106
Let's see what you have.

25:51.745 --> 25:54.013
Can I get you anything, sir?
A drink, some food?

25:54.015 --> 25:56.749
No, thank you.
I need to change my shirt.

25:56.751 --> 25:58.184
It's stained.

25:58.186 --> 26:00.319
But first, show me
the interview room.

26:00.321 --> 26:01.621
Sure. This way.

26:09.530 --> 26:10.863
$40 on five, please.

26:10.865 --> 26:12.565
Good to go.

26:12.567 --> 26:14.901
...was found
dead on a small fishing boat

26:14.903 --> 26:18.104
near his vacation cabin,
the victim of a savage beating.

26:18.106 --> 26:21.007
The motive for the fatal attack
remains unknown.

26:21.009 --> 26:24.010
Syracuse Police have asked
the public to be on the lookout

26:24.012 --> 26:27.246
for two teenagers on the run
from a Maryland clinic,

26:27.248 --> 26:29.782
driving a 1989 silver
Toyota Camry.

26:29.784 --> 26:32.385
One of the teens is Dana Brody,

26:32.387 --> 26:35.588
daughter of fugitive Congressman
Nicholas Brody.

26:35.590 --> 26:37.723
Her companion, Leo Carras,

26:37.725 --> 26:39.258
is receiving
court-mandated treatment

26:39.260 --> 26:40.893
following the death
of his brother

26:40.895 --> 26:42.762
who died from a gunshot wound

26:42.764 --> 26:45.798
after an alleged suicide pact
with Leo.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.234
Police have asked the public
not to approach the couple

26:48.236 --> 26:53.739
but to contact Syracuse PD
at 800-555-0199.

26:53.741 --> 26:56.442
In sports, Chiefs fans may have
to open their wallet wider...

26:56.444 --> 26:57.944
That it?

26:57.946 --> 26:58.945
Yeah.

26:58.947 --> 27:00.646
95 cents.

27:07.955 --> 27:10.690
Hey, uh, what about
your change?

27:13.594 --> 27:14.961
Coming?

27:14.963 --> 27:16.162
Come on, we need to find

27:16.164 --> 27:18.131
a place to sleep
before it gets dark.

27:19.099 --> 27:21.367
You okay?

27:22.302 --> 27:24.237
I don't know.

27:24.239 --> 27:26.806
Will you tell me
about your brother?

27:26.808 --> 27:28.808
Tell you what?

27:28.810 --> 27:30.143
Tell me what happened.

27:30.145 --> 27:32.578
I already told you.

27:32.580 --> 27:34.413
So, will you tell me again?

27:34.415 --> 27:36.315
Look, I don't exactly
enjoy talking about it.

27:36.317 --> 27:37.750
Will you please just tell me?

27:37.752 --> 27:39.785
I want to understand.

27:39.787 --> 27:43.656
I was in my room doing homework,

27:43.658 --> 27:46.759
I heard a gunshot,

27:46.761 --> 27:48.995
I went into Phil's room,

27:48.997 --> 27:52.665
he was... he was lying there,
blood everywhere.

27:52.667 --> 27:55.368
Somehow he'd gotten
hold of my dad's gun.

27:55.370 --> 27:58.304
Before, you said that
he-he'd done it in front of you.

27:58.306 --> 27:59.839
Because that's
what it felt like.

27:59.841 --> 28:01.174
He was right next door.

28:01.176 --> 28:02.341
In front of you, next door?

28:02.343 --> 28:03.843
How can that feel like
the same thing?

28:03.845 --> 28:06.512
Hey, Dana, Dana,
what's got into you?

28:06.514 --> 28:08.748
They said it was different
on the news.

28:09.716 --> 28:11.217
What news?

28:11.219 --> 28:13.052
In there.

28:13.054 --> 28:14.720
We're-we're on the news.
They're looking for us.

28:14.722 --> 28:16.389
And they said what happened

28:16.391 --> 28:18.858
to you and your brother
was a suicide pact.

28:18.860 --> 28:19.892
The fucking news.

28:19.894 --> 28:20.893
Jesus, like they were there.

28:20.895 --> 28:22.195
I mean, you know better
than anyone else

28:22.197 --> 28:23.529
what these people make up.

28:23.531 --> 28:25.364
Except in my case,
they didn't make anything up.

28:25.366 --> 28:27.633
It was... it was all true,
every single thing they said.

28:27.635 --> 28:29.035
Would you just get in the car?

28:29.037 --> 28:30.369
So-so which is it?

28:30.371 --> 28:31.704
Did Phillip kill himself
in his room?

28:31.706 --> 28:33.372
- Is that what happened?
- Yes!

28:33.374 --> 28:34.607
Will you get in the car?!

28:36.543 --> 28:38.377
How did he get the gun?

28:38.379 --> 28:40.046
I don't know.
He got hold of it.

28:40.048 --> 28:41.380
- You are lying.
- I'm not.

28:41.382 --> 28:42.582
You are. I can tell.

28:42.584 --> 28:44.650
- Why are you doing this?
- Stop the car.

28:44.652 --> 28:46.219
- No. Dana...
- Stop. Let me out!

28:46.221 --> 28:48.921
- No, you're gonna hurt yourself!
- No, stop! Who cares?

28:48.923 --> 28:50.523
Jesus! Dana!

28:53.061 --> 28:54.794
Dana!

28:56.063 --> 28:57.897
Please stop!

28:57.899 --> 28:59.065
Dana, please wait!

28:59.067 --> 29:01.100
Wait, just tell me
what you want, I'll do it!

29:01.102 --> 29:02.435
Tell me the truth!

29:02.437 --> 29:03.703
I'm calling the police!

29:03.705 --> 29:04.904
I'll tell... I'll tell you
the truth.

29:04.906 --> 29:06.072
Dana, please.

29:06.074 --> 29:07.573
Leave me alone.

29:07.575 --> 29:08.908
I love you.

29:08.910 --> 29:10.343
Don't say that, that
doesn't mean anything.

29:10.345 --> 29:11.744
It does to me.
I love you.

29:11.746 --> 29:12.945
Get off of me.

29:12.947 --> 29:14.247
Dana, listen to me.

29:14.249 --> 29:15.615
Why would I listen to you?

29:15.617 --> 29:16.949
- Dana...
- Why would I listen to you?

29:16.951 --> 29:18.084
Because you're right! It was me!

29:18.086 --> 29:19.418
It was my idea,

29:19.420 --> 29:20.920
playing the game with the gun.

29:20.922 --> 29:22.922
It was my idea,
my fault he's dead.

29:22.924 --> 29:24.223
I wanted to tell you,

29:24.225 --> 29:25.891
but I-I couldn't;
I didn't know how to.

29:25.893 --> 29:27.760
You just say it.

29:27.762 --> 29:28.861
How do I say that?

29:28.863 --> 29:30.630
I liked you,
I wanted you to like me.

29:30.632 --> 29:31.731
How-how do I say that?

29:31.733 --> 29:33.199
You just say it!

29:33.201 --> 29:34.900
Like I said it!

29:34.902 --> 29:37.069
Like, "My dad murdered
200 people."

29:37.071 --> 29:39.639
Like, "I tried
to kill myself."

29:39.641 --> 29:42.308
I told you! I told you
over and over again

29:42.310 --> 29:45.111
that the one thing I cannot
have in my life is lies,

29:45.113 --> 29:46.379
and you lied to me!

29:46.381 --> 29:47.847
Dana, please.

30:48.809 --> 30:49.842
Saul.

30:49.844 --> 30:52.144
Carrie, how you doing?

30:52.146 --> 30:54.347
Going a little crazy,
to be honest.

30:54.349 --> 30:56.515
Have you heard anything?

30:56.517 --> 30:58.184
Yeah, I heard about you
and Jessica Brody,

30:58.186 --> 30:59.552
about you and the FBI.

30:59.554 --> 31:00.653
That's what I heard.

31:00.655 --> 31:02.188
I had no options, Saul.

31:02.190 --> 31:04.156
But you did have
an option, Carrie,

31:04.158 --> 31:05.725
which was not to compromise
our operation.

31:05.727 --> 31:07.326
I didn't. Last I looked,

31:07.328 --> 31:08.728
the surveillance
is still in place.

31:08.730 --> 31:10.029
We're still in business.

31:10.031 --> 31:11.897
Well, you should look again.

31:11.899 --> 31:13.332
Quinn just called.

31:13.334 --> 31:16.135
Surveillance pulled out
five minutes ago.

31:21.708 --> 31:24.510
Well, maybe they just
knocked off for the night,

31:24.512 --> 31:26.078
or maybe Javadi's delayed.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.347
Or maybe they saw through
your fool's errand

31:28.349 --> 31:29.982
on behalf of Brody's daughter.

31:29.984 --> 31:32.351
Brody's daughter,
for fuck's sake.

31:32.353 --> 31:34.553
You realize how much work
you wasted?

31:34.555 --> 31:36.756
How much goddamn pain?

31:39.226 --> 31:41.727
I-I wasn't made, Saul.
I know I wasn't.

31:44.732 --> 31:46.432
Right.

31:46.434 --> 31:48.734
Saul, listen to me.

31:48.736 --> 31:51.437
I've got to go.

32:14.928 --> 32:19.465
♪ I've got my pride,
I've got my soul ♪

32:19.467 --> 32:23.436
♪ my dignity to hold on to ♪

32:23.438 --> 32:25.104
♪ when you do what you do... ♪

32:25.106 --> 32:26.472
Getting worried.

32:26.474 --> 32:28.307
Thought you might
have run out on us.

32:28.309 --> 32:30.042
When I'm having so
much fun? Scotch.

32:30.044 --> 32:31.577
Lockhart told me

32:31.579 --> 32:33.646
you had a spirited
exchange of views.

32:33.648 --> 32:36.715
Yep. We didn't agree
on a damn thing.

32:36.717 --> 32:40.119
You know what might have been
nice, though, from a friend?

32:40.121 --> 32:43.856
A word of fucking warning
about what was going on.

32:49.796 --> 32:51.096
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:51.098 --> 32:53.632
if I could have your
attention, please.

32:55.636 --> 32:59.772
Um, you know why
I invited you here.

32:59.774 --> 33:04.076
To set the future direction
of our nation's intelligence

33:04.078 --> 33:07.112
and to kill some geese.

33:09.150 --> 33:12.151
I believe that both of those
missions have been accomplished.

33:12.153 --> 33:14.854
So would you please raise
a glass with me

33:14.856 --> 33:18.290
to Andrew Lockhart,

33:18.292 --> 33:20.693
the man the President
has chosen

33:20.695 --> 33:24.029
to be the next director
of the CIA.

33:24.031 --> 33:25.264
Hear, hear!

33:25.266 --> 33:26.799
Well done.

33:26.801 --> 33:28.300
Thank you.

33:28.302 --> 33:31.704
Thank you all.

33:31.706 --> 33:33.839
I want you to know that

33:33.841 --> 33:36.041
when the President announces
my nomination tomorrow,

33:36.043 --> 33:38.677
there won't be a
prouder man in America.

33:38.679 --> 33:40.679
And two weeks from now,

33:40.681 --> 33:44.149
when, by God's grace,
I'll be confirmed,

33:44.151 --> 33:47.019
there won't be a humbler.

33:47.021 --> 33:49.355
Humble, because I know

33:49.357 --> 33:52.358
that I wouldn't be
standing here tonight

33:52.360 --> 33:55.227
without the support
of all of you.

33:55.229 --> 34:00.366
And a special thanks to the man
who was the caretaker

34:00.368 --> 34:03.369
of the Agency through
this most difficult time,

34:03.371 --> 34:04.703
Saul Berenson.

34:04.705 --> 34:06.005
To you, Saul.

34:06.007 --> 34:07.540
Well done.

34:07.542 --> 34:09.275
Hear, hear.

34:11.878 --> 34:14.079
And on that happy note,

34:14.081 --> 34:15.313
I think we can eat.

34:15.315 --> 34:16.649
One second, Mike.

34:16.650 --> 34:18.217
I, too, would like to
congratulate Senator Lockhart

34:18.219 --> 34:19.385
on his nomination.

34:19.387 --> 34:22.721
If he's half as good a director

34:22.723 --> 34:25.925
as he is a shot,
we're in safe hands.

34:27.762 --> 34:30.728
Maybe that wasn't
the right analogy.

34:30.731 --> 34:33.331
Being a spy isn't the same as

34:33.333 --> 34:34.567
sitting in a hide

34:34.569 --> 34:37.069
waiting for the enemy
to come under your guns.

34:37.071 --> 34:40.539
You're in the jungle,
usually in the dark,

34:40.541 --> 34:44.976
with bad information
and unreliable partners.

34:47.047 --> 34:48.914
The Senator's made a career

34:48.916 --> 34:52.418
criticizing the Agency
he's about to lead.

34:52.420 --> 34:56.755
His first job, in my opinion,
is to win the hearts and minds

34:56.757 --> 34:58.591
of those men and women

34:58.593 --> 35:00.492
in harm's way.

35:02.429 --> 35:04.630
Otherwise, he's just another
political appointee

35:04.632 --> 35:07.600
holding up his finger to see
which way the wind is blowing.

35:11.471 --> 35:13.539
I wish you luck, Senator.

35:18.111 --> 35:22.548
In the meantime, I still have
two weeks left on my watch

35:22.550 --> 35:25.751
and a lot of work to do.

35:25.753 --> 35:28.020
Bon appétit.

35:32.592 --> 35:34.660
General.

36:32.852 --> 36:34.586
I'm okay.

36:38.191 --> 36:40.259
Really.

38:39.145 --> 38:40.245
Yes?

38:40.247 --> 38:42.114
It's Quinn.

38:42.116 --> 38:44.449
I know.
Is the surveillance back?

38:44.451 --> 38:45.551
No.

38:46.986 --> 38:49.822
You okay?

38:49.824 --> 38:52.191
Not really.

38:55.595 --> 38:57.262
Where are you?

38:57.264 --> 39:00.432
About a hundred yards away.

39:01.769 --> 39:03.302
I'm not sure I like

39:03.304 --> 39:05.370
being watched over
by you, Quinn.

39:07.173 --> 39:08.674
I'm at a safe distance.

39:08.676 --> 39:11.777
Anyway, according to Saul,
you're wasting your time.

39:11.779 --> 39:13.412
I blew it.

39:14.681 --> 39:17.349
You don't know that.

39:17.351 --> 39:18.617
You were there.

39:18.619 --> 39:20.085
Did I get made?

39:21.020 --> 39:22.754
I don't know.

39:24.557 --> 39:26.592
It was always
a fucking long shot.

39:30.897 --> 39:32.531
Night, Quinn.

39:41.708 --> 39:43.375
Saul?

39:43.377 --> 39:46.712
I didn't expect you
back tonight.

39:46.714 --> 39:49.848
This is Alan Bernard.

39:49.850 --> 39:51.950
Hello.

39:53.386 --> 39:56.755
Alan and I worked together
in Mumbai, and...

39:56.757 --> 39:59.625
Saul?

40:32.558 --> 40:33.992
No sound.

40:46.440 --> 40:47.439
Open.

40:47.441 --> 40:49.107
Open.

40:55.415 --> 40:57.616
Take off your clothes.

40:57.618 --> 40:58.617
Everything.

40:58.619 --> 41:01.353
No, please.

41:03.423 --> 41:05.090
Okay.

41:05.092 --> 41:07.159
Okay, I'll do it.

42:11.190 --> 42:12.524
Yes.

42:12.526 --> 42:14.860
I think the watch is back on.

42:14.862 --> 42:16.294
What are you seeing?

42:16.296 --> 42:17.329
I'm not sure.

42:17.331 --> 42:18.830
I put a GoPro camera
on her street,

42:18.832 --> 42:20.198
but it's not
showing me anything.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.034
I got to get closer.

42:22.036 --> 42:23.402
No, no, stay put.

42:27.708 --> 42:29.241
Dress now.

42:29.243 --> 42:31.276
No.

42:33.179 --> 42:36.415
In these.

42:36.417 --> 42:37.916
No, this-this isn't right.

42:37.918 --> 42:39.584
This is not what we agreed.

42:39.586 --> 42:40.685
Nothing is agreed.

42:40.687 --> 42:42.421
Get dressed.

42:49.929 --> 42:51.797
Anything?

43:06.245 --> 43:08.246
Any sign of Carrie?

43:08.248 --> 43:09.915
No, there's no sign of Carrie.

43:09.917 --> 43:11.583
I'm too fucking far away.

43:11.585 --> 43:13.251
Well, keep your distance.

43:13.253 --> 43:14.920
That's an order.

43:24.597 --> 43:26.665
Hurry.

43:41.747 --> 43:42.747
I'm getting closer.

43:42.749 --> 43:43.782
Quinn.

43:43.784 --> 43:45.350
Do not move.

43:48.087 --> 43:50.155
Quinn?

44:57.323 --> 44:58.924
Saul?

44:59.859 --> 45:01.226
Not now.

45:01.228 --> 45:03.428
Saul, please.

45:09.235 --> 45:10.468
Yes.

45:10.470 --> 45:11.870
Yeah, I'm inside. She's gone.

45:11.872 --> 45:14.172
They left her clothes.

45:14.174 --> 45:15.207
Broke her phone.

45:15.209 --> 45:16.541
I guess they got her SIM.

45:16.543 --> 45:18.543
We lost her.

45:18.545 --> 45:21.413
But we know who's got her.

45:21.415 --> 45:23.548
We're back in business.

45:23.550 --> 45:25.283
She's on her own, Saul.

45:27.253 --> 45:30.121
She's always been on her own.

45:56.449 --> 45:58.650
Take it off.

46:01.787 --> 46:04.289
Carrie Mathison.

46:04.291 --> 46:07.792
You're in good shape.

46:07.794 --> 46:10.195
Must be all that yoga.

Are you ready?

46:32.658 --> 46:33.987
ON THE NEXT HOMELAND

46:34.124 --> 46:36.575
I watched the man I thought
I knew become an animal...

46:37.171 --> 46:38.421
in front of my eyes.

46:38.628 --> 46:39.951
This is just the beginning.

46:40.078 --> 46:42.075
Does anyone else know that
you and I are meeting?

46:42.193 --> 46:43.335
No.

46:43.451 --> 46:45.502
The machine says you're lying.
