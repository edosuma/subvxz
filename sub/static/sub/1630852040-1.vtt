Oh, you came back here for free rent,
free childcare, free everything.

01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:36.075

I get my ass up out of here.

01:10:37.075 --> 01:10:39.866
All right. Get on up
out of here then. Fast, too.

01:10:39.991 --> 01:10:43.700
Okay. You know, something?
<font color="#87CEFA">(chuckles)</font> I spoiled you as a child.

01:10:43.825 --> 01:10:48.075
- Yeah, gave you everything.
- You spoiled me? You destroyed me.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.200
And you wasn't no damn mama.

01:10:50.325 --> 01:10:52.325
No mama? Really?

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:56.241
Who birthed you? Raised you?
Kept a motherfucking roof over your head?

01:10:56.366 --> 01:10:58.366
Oh. I had a motherfucking roof
over my head.

01:10:58.491 --> 01:11:01.991
But what I needed was a goddamn
lock on my bedroom door.

01:11:02.116 --> 01:11:05.491
- Lock? For what?
- You know damn well for what.

01:11:05.616 --> 01:11:08.991
Okay, you see,
you was always one for making stories.

01:11:09.116 --> 01:11:12.283

you serving today?

01:11:12.408 --> 01:11:14.200
Oh. You know
what the question is?

01:11:14.325 --> 01:11:17.241
What kind of bullshit
was you serving to yourself

01:11:17.366 --> 01:11:20.075
when your baby girl was back
there in that room being raped.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.616
- Raped?
- Raped.

01:11:21.741 --> 01:11:23.950
By all your boyfriends
coming in and out of that room.

01:11:24.075 --> 01:11:26.575
And your nasty-ass brother
Dexter too.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.325
- Dexter paid the rent!
- No, I paid the rent!

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:31.991
- With my ass, my mouth, my private parts.
- Liar!

01:11:32.116 --> 01:11:34.033
- Don't talk about your uncle.
- You a liar. You knew.

01:11:34.158 --> 01:11:35.325

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:32.283

She earned it with a perfect

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.241
taking everybody out
within the distance.

01:39:00.366 --> 01:39:03.283
<font color="#FF7F50"><b>JULES</b></font>: With the pace and power
that the Lady Killer brings

01:39:03.408 --> 01:39:07.158

She is undefeated as a professional.

01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:23.991
She wears green this evening

01:40:24.116 --> 01:40:29.491
Now living and training out of

A creative way
of getting out of it.

She might wanna
stay down there.

01:41:35.783 --> 01:41:38.408

Can she come back in the second round?

If she does, that tells me that she's been
in the trench and working on her game.

If this is the woman

<font color="#FF7F50"><b>YVES</b></font>: Look at Justice. She's
working for a single from the bottom.

Four years out of the cage to come

We didn't see this
earlier tonight.

01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:00.116

<font color="#FF7F50"><b>YVES</b></font>: She's looking for this triangle.
And that's deep.

she can just pull on that head!

01:51:20.241 --> 01:51:21.950

what she needs to do!

01:51:22.075 --> 01:51:23.616

- That's the question.
- <font color="#FF7F50"><b>JULES</b></font>: She looks exhausted.
