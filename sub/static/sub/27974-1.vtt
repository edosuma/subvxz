00:12.200 --> 00:16.199
Stop! That isn't the way
to cross the road.

00:16.200 --> 00:21.200
If you step out here,
you could get badly hurt. Or worse.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.199
This is a pedestrian
light controlled crossing.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.199
Or PELICON crossing for short.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.200
To cross the road,
press the button... and wait.

00:36.200 --> 00:40.399
Wait until the red man
changes to the green man.

00:49.935 --> 00:52.420
So always find a safe place to cross

00:52.445 --> 00:55.199
at a designated pedestrian crossing.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.400
And remember, if the pelican can,
then so can you.

'What Is And What Should Be'
by Led Zeppelin

01:51.200 --> 01:54.879
Next one, please. Thank you.
That's lovely.

02:02.059 --> 02:03.224
That's beautiful.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.628
Big smile.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.199
I, Charles, Prince of Wales,

03:04.200 --> 03:07.719
do become your liege man
of life and limb,

03:07.720 --> 03:10.040
and of earthly worship.

03:33.200 --> 03:37.880
Hello, Pat, it's Karen. Is Ann with you?

03:39.799 --> 03:41.200
No, I just wondered

03:41.201 --> 03:43.200
if she'd come back with Jeanette
after school?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.200
Shop!

04:37.200 --> 04:39.240
This is where
you've been keeping yourself, is it?

04:41.633 --> 04:42.953
I was passing.

04:44.240 --> 04:51.200
People tend to.
Look, I, er... come bearing gifts.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.200
CID closed a month after
I arrived in Woodstock. Budget.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.352
It was uniform or nothing.
What about you?

05:01.353 --> 05:03.320
You know me. I'm doing all right.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.199
There was a piece in the Gazette.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.199
Inter-Departmental something or other.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.719
The Inter-Departmental
Forward Planning Steering Committee.

05:12.720 --> 05:18.199
- Steering what, exactly?
- Resources. Manpower.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.885
It's a sort of
quasi-managerial anticipatory role.

05:20.886 --> 05:23.560
- Is it?
- Just shuffling paperwork, mostly.

05:28.740 --> 05:29.900
Seen the old man?

05:32.200 --> 05:37.040
I've called the house a few times.
Left messages.

05:38.666 --> 05:41.460
- I'd have told 'em where to stick it.
- Would you?

05:43.200 --> 05:46.200
Division don't like
to lose police officers.

05:47.966 --> 05:51.966
Full disciplinary, though?
Busted down a rank?

05:53.007 --> 05:54.007
It wasn't right.

05:55.240 --> 05:58.200
And we're still no nearer
to finding who did for George.

05:59.560 --> 06:04.559
"We"? I'm here. You're there.

06:04.560 --> 06:09.199
Thursday's at Castle Gate.
Bright's at traffic.

06:09.200 --> 06:14.039
I mean... there is no "we",
nor is there likely to be.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.200
- We said...
- No, you said.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.766
Heat of the moment.

06:18.791 --> 06:21.199
- I meant it.
- Yes, I'm sure.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.200
But it's not how it's turned out, is it?

06:26.200 --> 06:28.400
It's never how these things turn out.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.199
We are launching a fresh appeal
to the public

06:35.200 --> 06:39.199
to be on the lookout for Ann Kirby,
who went missing on the 1st of July

06:39.200 --> 06:43.199
on her way home from school,
and who hasn't been seen since.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.192
Now, obviously, as the days pass by,

06:45.217 --> 06:46.783
we're becoming more and more concerned

06:47.280 --> 06:49.199
for her safety and well-being.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.199
To that end, I would urge anyone
who has any information

06:53.200 --> 06:56.199
about her disappearance to come forward

06:56.200 --> 06:58.199
and to contact the police.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.845
Your call will be treated
with the strictest confidence

07:00.846 --> 07:02.719
and may be made anonymously.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.940
If you have any information, any at all,

07:04.941 --> 07:08.879
no matter how slight
or trivial it may appear,

07:08.880 --> 07:12.399
then, please,
do contact us as soon as possible.

07:12.400 --> 07:17.199
Now, I, er, I will just take
one or two questions from the press.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.199
- Chief Inspector.
- Yes, Miss Frazil?

07:20.200 --> 07:22.559
Is there any suggestion
she might have been kidnapped?

07:22.560 --> 07:23.863
Extraordinary.

07:23.864 --> 07:26.559
Er, no. No, there's no indication
that such is the case.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.199
- How are the family?
- Well, as you can imagine,

07:29.200 --> 07:31.199
they're worried about their little girl.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.655
Chief Inspector.

07:32.656 --> 07:36.200
One at a time, please. All right.
Settle down. Settle down.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.200
Well, then, matey...

07:43.560 --> 07:45.879
Look, let me know next time,
and I'll bake a cake.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.400
Oh, I saw Joanie.
Said to say hello if I ran into you.

07:51.347 --> 07:53.666
Started in as a trainee with the Welfare.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.200
So, I suppose it all works out
in the end.

08:03.106 --> 08:06.106
We shouldn't let it go,
what happened to George.

08:07.560 --> 08:10.200
- Well, don't you care?
- Would it make a difference?

08:35.200 --> 08:37.558
Police have made
a fresh appeal to the public

08:37.559 --> 08:39.198
for information concerning
the whereabouts

08:39.200 --> 08:42.198
of missing schoolgirl Anne Kirby,
aged 10.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.923
Obviously, as the days pass by,

08:43.924 --> 08:45.564
we're becoming more and more concerned,

08:45.565 --> 08:47.200
for her safety and well-being.

08:47.759 --> 08:51.078
To that end, I would urge anyone
who has any information

08:51.103 --> 08:54.103
about her disappearance, to come forward.

09:09.526 --> 09:11.772
There's been a young man hanging around.

09:11.797 --> 09:16.960
I think he's been sleeping
in the porch. This was in the nave.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.719
Good morning. Sergeant Morse.
Mr Tingwell, is it?

09:36.720 --> 09:38.953
- Yes, that's right.
- Well, how can I help you?

09:38.954 --> 09:41.199
Information room said something
about a missing horse?

09:41.200 --> 09:44.199
Skynner here was due to collect
a Connemara from me this morning,

09:44.200 --> 09:45.200
only it's not in the field.

09:45.201 --> 09:50.199
Right, well, when was the last time
that you saw it?

09:50.200 --> 09:54.200
Yesterday afternoon. 15 hands. Grey.

09:54.886 --> 09:58.199
Well, I can pass the description
on to neighbouring stations,

09:58.200 --> 10:01.200
and I'll keep an eye out for it,
when I'm on my rounds.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.520
I've got night class. It's important.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.199
Got to do something for me,
I can't sit by the window

10:43.200 --> 10:45.200
and wait for someone
to tell me my life can start.

10:46.033 --> 10:47.033
I can't do it anymore.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.033
I can't do this anymore.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.199
I suppose I should've shut the window

11:06.200 --> 11:09.559
upon retiring to bed,
but it was really rather hot.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.200
And one just doesn't expect
that sort of thing out this way.

11:14.902 --> 11:20.199
So, it's seven snuff boxes,
and a couple of lighters.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.200
All silver, is that right?

11:24.200 --> 11:27.399
- Doctor Sheridan?
- Er, yes. Yes, that's right.

11:27.400 --> 11:31.012
- But it's only the snuff boxes that have any real value.
- Oh.

11:31.013 --> 11:34.200
Most of them are Victorian.
Two of them are Georgian.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.080
- They're something of a passion with me.
- I see.

11:38.119 --> 11:40.799
Oh, I can let you have a photograph,
if you give me a moment.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.200
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.199
- Was it the boy that did it?
- What boy would that be?

12:08.200 --> 12:12.199
There was a boy watching the house
from across the road

12:12.200 --> 12:14.200
- yesterday evening.
- Oh, yes?

12:16.200 --> 12:20.199
- And what did he look like?
- Like he could do with a good wash.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.200
Yes, I knew I had a picture...

12:23.839 --> 12:26.199
I'll be with you in a moment,
Sophie, dear.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.433
Well, I just came in for my book.

12:27.434 --> 12:30.239
Yes, well, as you can see,
the officer is busy.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.200
I'll bring it to you.

12:36.971 --> 12:38.200
The terrible teens!

12:39.200 --> 12:40.690
I'm afraid the police training manual

12:40.691 --> 12:42.200
is silent on that subject.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.200
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

15:08.620 --> 15:12.620
- No sign of her satchel?
- Well, we'll find it.

15:14.930 --> 15:16.929
What do you think
to the flowers in her hair?

15:16.930 --> 15:17.930
Well, it's probably best

15:17.931 --> 15:19.970
we leave it to them that gets paid
to ask those questions, eh?

15:21.930 --> 15:23.400
All right, mate. Thanks for your help.

15:23.401 --> 15:24.999
We'll take it from here.
If you could do something

15:25.000 --> 15:27.929
- about the nag...
- There's a horsebox on its way.

15:27.930 --> 15:29.969
Well, we've got a tea-urn coming out.

15:29.970 --> 15:33.930
- If you could find a spot for that?
- Don't you want my report?

15:35.736 --> 15:39.736
When the gaffer gets here.
She's not going anywhere, is she?

15:53.930 --> 15:57.930
Well, you do get about.
I thought I hadn't seen you.

15:58.930 --> 16:02.449
- What's the, uh...
- Dead about 24 hours.

16:02.450 --> 16:05.969
Sizeable bruise on the skull,
same to her hip, too.

16:05.970 --> 16:09.929
But nothing to say
how she died at first glance.

16:10.390 --> 16:13.930
- And...
- No. No obvious sign.

16:18.516 --> 16:20.515
- DS Jago says you found the body?
- Sir.

16:20.930 --> 16:24.770
Sergeant Morse, sir.
A former colleague from Cowley.

16:26.330 --> 16:31.650
I remember. Didn't recognise you. So?

16:33.670 --> 16:36.669
I had a report of a horse stolen
from Tingwell's Farm last night.

16:36.694 --> 16:39.905
I was on my rounds, I saw an animal
matching that description.

16:39.930 --> 16:45.929
I came into the field, I found her,
and I called it in.

16:45.930 --> 16:48.930
Right. Fair enough.
That's you done, then.

16:52.930 --> 16:55.545
What... It's standard practice
in such cases

16:55.546 --> 16:58.625
to ask if anybody unusual
has been reported in the area.

16:58.626 --> 16:59.932
- Have they?
- Yes,

16:59.957 --> 17:03.929
there's a young man been seen
hanging around the church.

17:03.930 --> 17:06.952
A rough sleeper. The offertory
box was forced last night.

17:06.977 --> 17:08.037
Right.

17:08.038 --> 17:10.929
Possibly drug use. I've a syringe
recovered from the church.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.929
- You might...
- Stick it in your report.

17:12.930 --> 17:17.382
Make sure it's on my desk by tea.
And next time, try to remember

17:17.383 --> 17:19.929
we put a cordon down,
so uniform don't go trampling

17:19.930 --> 17:22.930
all over the scene of crime
with their size nines.

17:23.930 --> 17:26.930
Standard practice in a case like this.

17:32.930 --> 17:34.130
Right.

17:42.696 --> 17:45.696
- Fred.
- Guv.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.710
Pervert?

18:01.683 --> 18:04.999
Are you asking if there's
evidence of sexual assault?

18:05.024 --> 18:06.092
Is there?

18:06.783 --> 18:08.783
Not at first glance, no.

18:09.930 --> 18:12.929
Be able to tell you more
after the post-mortem.

18:12.930 --> 18:16.290
- Shall we say four o'clock?
- You can say what you like.

18:17.709 --> 18:21.709
I'm not one for seeing kiddies
carved up. Liaise with DI Thursday.

18:28.403 --> 18:31.150
I'll brief upstairs.
Can you take the parents?

18:32.329 --> 18:35.649
- If that's what you want.
- See you back at the factory.

18:40.077 --> 18:44.117
- He's come from robbery.
- Not the Lucy Clayton?

18:45.363 --> 18:50.522
Still. It's nice to see you,
Inspector. And Morse, of course.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.969
One might've known
if anyone was going to find her,

18:52.970 --> 18:54.610
it would be him.

19:35.623 --> 19:36.623
No.

19:39.930 --> 19:40.930
Not my Ann.

19:43.930 --> 19:44.930
Not my Annie.

19:47.930 --> 19:50.929
- It's a mistake.
- Love...

19:50.930 --> 19:52.930
They've made a mistake.

19:54.930 --> 19:57.770
You... You have made a mistake.

19:58.930 --> 20:02.930
It's got to be some other girl.
Tell him, Joe.

20:04.387 --> 20:06.414
Tell him it's got to be some other girl.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.954
Come on, love...

20:08.569 --> 20:10.150
My sincere condolences.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.769
The body of a young girl

20:23.770 --> 20:25.929
has been found in the countryside
west of Oxford.

20:25.930 --> 20:29.129
Police have not confirmed yet
if it is that of Ann Kirby,

20:29.130 --> 20:30.929
who went missing
on the way home from her school

20:30.930 --> 20:32.450
in Banbury on Tuesday...

21:10.930 --> 21:13.930
My report. Syringe is in the bag.

21:15.930 --> 21:17.930
I'll see the guv'nor gets it.

21:19.810 --> 21:20.905
Anything?

21:21.550 --> 21:24.834
Early days. You know how it is.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.903
Mind how you go.

21:32.590 --> 21:34.970
You are looking at
the Emily Bayard case, presumably?

21:36.283 --> 21:38.070
Er, Berkshire case.

21:38.930 --> 21:41.351
Disappeared on her way home
from school, July 1966.

21:41.352 --> 21:45.930
- Very, very similar circumstances.
- Only she was never found.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.930
The DCI's ruled it out.

21:49.930 --> 21:51.930
Is he up to it? Box.

21:52.930 --> 21:54.929
A Sergeant doesn't question

21:54.930 --> 21:57.929
a Detective Chief Inspector's
fitness to lead an inquiry.

21:57.930 --> 22:02.930
- "Robbery? I've shit 'em," wasn't it?
- Things change.

22:04.930 --> 22:08.929
I'm sorry about your disciplinary.
You deserved better.

22:08.930 --> 22:12.610
I don't know about that. I was in charge.

22:13.339 --> 22:15.930
Well, if you fancy
getting a drink some time...

22:17.763 --> 22:20.763
Yeah. Yeah, we, er...

22:22.209 --> 22:24.049
...we must do that.

22:29.403 --> 22:32.043
Give my regards to Mrs Thursday.

22:32.930 --> 22:35.930
It won't be any stroke of genius
that finds him.

22:36.930 --> 22:39.930
Long hours and shoe-leather
will see this one right.

22:40.524 --> 22:46.110
No obscure motive to be uncovered.
Just depravity. Some nobody.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.930
On file already, like as not.

22:51.930 --> 22:54.929
Initial reports said she was wearing
an Alice band in her hair

22:54.930 --> 22:56.150
when she left school.

22:57.259 --> 23:00.330
- It wasn't at the scene.
- Could be in the field.

23:00.821 --> 23:02.420
Why there?

23:03.568 --> 23:05.481
He could have left her body anywhere.

23:05.482 --> 23:07.644
In a ditch, in the middle
of the field somewhere.

23:07.645 --> 23:09.556
She wouldn't have been found
until harvest time.

23:09.557 --> 23:11.930
Why leave her at the foot of a pylon?

23:15.970 --> 23:18.929
- Showing off maybe?
- No, it matters.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.930
Same as the flowers. It's important.

23:23.930 --> 23:26.450
Sergeant Morse
delivering his report, sir.

23:28.930 --> 23:32.129
- Nicked your little thief, yet?
- Not quite.

23:32.130 --> 23:34.130
Well, don't let us keep you.

23:37.930 --> 23:38.930
Sir.

24:19.716 --> 24:20.716
Hey!

24:25.930 --> 24:27.930
Ugh!

24:53.930 --> 24:56.929
Stanley Clemence. Date of birth,
October the 4th, 1951.

24:56.930 --> 24:59.242
- Of no fixed abode.
- What about family?

24:59.243 --> 25:00.929
He hasn't asked
for anyone to be informed.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.929
We've got a string
of juvenile previous on him.

25:02.930 --> 25:04.929
Been in trouble on and off
since he was about 10.

25:04.930 --> 25:07.609
Next of kin's an aunt in Torquay.

25:07.610 --> 25:09.930
You want to brace him now,
or when the dew's still on him?

25:10.930 --> 25:13.930
Let him sweat it a minute.
I haven't had my tea yet.

25:14.331 --> 25:16.929
- See your reports here first thing.
- Well, I can do it now,

25:16.930 --> 25:19.465
if I could take a loan of a typewriter.

25:19.466 --> 25:20.930
The pool's gone home.

25:20.931 --> 25:23.929
I kept my old machine.
Er, it's all right, innit?

25:23.930 --> 25:25.930
So long as he keeps his beak out
of anything else.

25:29.118 --> 25:31.969
Hard to see how he could've kept
Ann Kirby holed up all this time,

25:31.970 --> 25:35.930
- if he's been living in a squat.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

25:36.790 --> 25:39.629
He's your collar, Sergeant.
This goes the distance,

25:39.654 --> 25:40.929
could be your ticket back to big school.

25:40.930 --> 25:43.405
Unless you want to stay
counting cabbages out in the sticks.

25:43.406 --> 25:45.502
Sergeant Morse's got a point, sir.

25:45.503 --> 25:48.309
Thief and drug addict's one thing.
A child murderer's something else.

25:48.310 --> 25:50.929
If he's not involved,
how's he come by her satchel?

25:50.930 --> 25:54.929
Oh, I was just asking.
What if he didn't do it?

25:54.930 --> 25:58.990
It's the court's business, not ours.
We just get them up the steps.

26:15.290 --> 26:18.930
- You think he did it?
- I'm uniform. I don't get paid to think.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.110
I might know him.

26:23.930 --> 26:24.930
How?

27:07.750 --> 27:08.910
So, who killed his mother?

27:11.750 --> 27:15.750
His father. Philip Clemence.
Commercial traveller.

27:16.763 --> 27:18.763
Knocked out brushes, door to door.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.770
And did he go down for it?

27:28.930 --> 27:33.930
13 Jubilee Row.
Funny how some things stick.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.563
His maternal aunt and uncle took him on.

27:38.930 --> 27:41.930
Decent people... as I recall.

27:45.930 --> 27:49.930
Well... Mind how you go.

27:58.977 --> 28:02.297
- Tell me about Ann Kirby.
- I don't know her.

28:03.297 --> 28:05.471
Well, what are you
doing with her satchel?

28:06.042 --> 28:07.227
I found it.

28:08.463 --> 28:11.711
Look, man, can you help me out?
I don't feel good.

28:11.736 --> 28:12.756
Found it where?

28:13.823 --> 28:16.463
I don't remember.

28:18.463 --> 28:21.757
On the road, maybe.

28:21.758 --> 28:24.904
I'm serious. I'm sick. I need something.

28:24.905 --> 28:28.956
- What do you mean, you need something?
- A doctor!

28:30.463 --> 28:32.463
I need to see a doctor.

28:33.463 --> 28:37.116
Come on, man. You can see I'm not right.

28:40.463 --> 28:43.636
We know all about you, Stanley.

28:45.463 --> 28:46.463
You're bad blood.

28:50.503 --> 28:54.116
I'm not blaming you. It's not your fault.

28:55.463 --> 28:59.836
But you help us out with Ann,
we'll see about a Doctor.

29:03.463 --> 29:06.463
- Help you out how?
- Just put your hands up to it.

29:11.143 --> 29:12.463
I can't.

29:14.463 --> 29:17.463
I can't say I did something I didn't do!

30:13.463 --> 30:14.463
What he said...

30:16.463 --> 30:18.463
- Hm?
- The other one.

30:20.463 --> 30:24.276
Bad blood. You know about that?

30:30.463 --> 30:32.316
I carried you out of there.

30:36.355 --> 30:37.676
Ah, I don't remember.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.463
- Some things are best forgot.
- Mm.

30:46.463 --> 30:49.796
- What was she like?
- Who?

30:51.463 --> 30:52.716
My mum.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.576
Did you know her?

30:58.055 --> 30:59.156
Yeah.

31:01.463 --> 31:02.756
Yeah, I knew her.

31:05.795 --> 31:07.356
She was a good 'un.

31:16.463 --> 31:17.463
And him?

31:41.876 --> 31:45.462
Don't give me that old bollocks!
He's still a minor,

31:45.463 --> 31:49.462
he's got rights.
Uh-huh. Oh, is that right?

31:49.463 --> 31:52.462
Well, you tell him Viv Wall is coming.

31:52.970 --> 31:55.655
Wall. As in Berlin. As in bricks.

31:55.656 --> 31:58.462
As in, about to come down
on your round head like a ton of...

31:58.463 --> 31:59.818
Want me to spell it for you?

31:59.819 --> 32:01.463
Prick!

32:04.503 --> 32:09.302
Er, the psychiatric assessments
for the Pendleton hearing.

32:09.303 --> 32:10.841
Don't worry about that. Fetch your coat.

32:10.842 --> 32:14.303
- Why? Where are we going?
- To war.

32:18.463 --> 32:21.462
Wait for it. Wait for it..

32:21.463 --> 32:26.462
And remember, if the pelican can,
then so can you!

32:32.463 --> 32:36.463
There he goes. Right, then.

32:37.983 --> 32:40.983
Back to work. Fred.

32:45.085 --> 32:48.462
And tell me, is this the young man
you found sleeping in the porch?

32:48.463 --> 32:52.462
That's him. I did feel for the poor boy.

32:52.836 --> 32:56.462
Nowhere to live, he said.
No family. No money.

32:56.463 --> 32:59.462
I told him
to try some of the farms hereabouts.

32:59.463 --> 33:02.462
Skynner the slaughterman
sometimes takes on casual labour.

33:02.796 --> 33:05.463
You think he robbed the offertory?

33:09.796 --> 33:11.462
I shall pray for him.

33:11.796 --> 33:16.463
Well, I've kept you from your flock
long enough. Thank you.

33:22.685 --> 33:25.724
- Very pretty.
- All from the vicarage garden.

33:25.725 --> 33:30.045
Friday a funeral. Saturday a bride.
Sunday a christening.

33:31.045 --> 33:33.685
The lot of a country parson.

33:34.685 --> 33:36.684
Shall we be seeing you at the fete?

33:36.685 --> 33:41.685
- Er, yes. Yes, I should think so.
- But not in church?

33:42.685 --> 33:45.684
Six months,
and you've not darkened my transept,

33:45.685 --> 33:50.684
except on official business.
Or perhaps you've lost your faith?

33:50.685 --> 33:52.685
There was never much to lose.

33:55.685 --> 33:56.916
We all have our doubts.

33:58.685 --> 34:00.685
There have been times in my own life...

34:03.045 --> 34:06.684
Ah, but I trust in the forgiveness
of a merciful Father.

34:07.396 --> 34:09.684
I can't imagine
there's much in a vicar's life

34:09.685 --> 34:10.685
warrants forgiving.

34:12.143 --> 34:13.916
No. Well...

34:15.685 --> 34:16.876
God be with you, Sergeant.

34:20.725 --> 34:25.684
Stanley Clemence is 17. A minor.
We should've been notified.

34:25.685 --> 34:27.684
- You have been.
- At once.

34:27.685 --> 34:31.684
Not the best part of 12 hours later.
According to the custody record,

34:31.685 --> 34:33.886
he's not been examined
by the police surgeon.

34:33.911 --> 34:34.946
What's this?

34:34.947 --> 34:38.684
Welfare. About Clemence. DCI Box.

34:38.685 --> 34:41.684
- You've interviewed him?
- Of course we have.

34:41.685 --> 34:44.524
- He's facing a serious charge.
- I don't care what he's facing.

34:44.525 --> 34:46.494
There should have been
a solicitor present.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.684
He declined.

34:47.685 --> 34:48.685
He's an addict.

34:49.315 --> 34:52.684
I doubt he was in a fit state
to decline anything.

34:52.685 --> 34:56.684
I want him independently assessed,
and I want the duty brief notified.

34:56.685 --> 35:00.684
- We'll look into it.
- You'll do it, or I'll know why.

35:00.685 --> 35:03.685
In the absence of family,
we stand in loco parentis.

35:06.454 --> 35:09.684
Word to the wise.
Little girls who squeak out of turn,

35:09.685 --> 35:11.684
are liable to find themselves
over my knee.

35:11.685 --> 35:13.685
- Oi!
- It's all right, Viv.

35:14.685 --> 35:16.685
- Like to see you try.
- Would you?

35:17.685 --> 35:21.685
So, who are you, then?
The sorcerer's apprentice?

35:22.451 --> 35:24.836
My daughter, sir. Joan.

35:27.205 --> 35:30.685
- Well, there's a thing.
- Railroading a kid into the dock?

35:31.685 --> 35:35.205
I expect better of you, Fred.
I want to see him.

35:36.164 --> 35:38.436
We want to see Stanley Clemence now!

35:43.137 --> 35:44.297
Dad.

35:49.685 --> 35:50.685
Small world.

35:53.065 --> 35:55.684
Sorry, I wish I could help you.
I've not seen him.

35:55.685 --> 35:57.878
- It's to do with this kiddie, is it?
- Oh, no, I'm just trying

35:57.879 --> 35:59.684
to locate his whereabouts
for the past few days.

35:59.685 --> 36:01.684
Where you two off to, then?

36:01.685 --> 36:04.685
Take her books back. Library's in Bladon.

36:05.405 --> 36:06.392
What's this, then?

36:06.417 --> 36:07.684
The sergeant, he's asking after some lad.

36:07.685 --> 36:10.685
Sorry, er, this is my wife, Mags.
Sergeant Morse.

36:11.685 --> 36:14.024
Didn't he do a couple of days last year?

36:14.049 --> 36:15.684
What, it's the same lad?

36:15.685 --> 36:18.685
- Stan?
- Yeah, that's him all right.

36:19.685 --> 36:23.044
- My, er, my wife wasn't too keen.
- Oh, why's that?

36:23.045 --> 36:26.364
He just had a weird way about him.

36:26.365 --> 36:29.994
Didn't sit right with me.
Thought we'd seen the last of him,

36:29.995 --> 36:32.204
but I saw him last week
hanging by the church.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.785
Should talk to the Reverend.

36:47.685 --> 36:51.468
Oh. Oh, sorry. I haven't got round
to taking the plates off yet.

36:51.469 --> 36:52.685
It's not an offence, is it?

36:53.885 --> 36:55.684
Well, I won't say anything if you don't.

36:55.685 --> 36:58.876
She only passed last week.
It's... It's third time lucky.

37:00.685 --> 37:03.916
It'll be a godsend, to be honest
with, er, with Laurel.

37:04.365 --> 37:06.036
It's muscular dystrophy.

37:06.685 --> 37:09.684
Taking her into town
for check-ups and that, you know.

37:09.685 --> 37:12.407
Up to now, it's either been the bus
or me, so...

37:12.408 --> 37:14.684
Usually means taking a day off work.

37:14.685 --> 37:16.684
You got kids?
Sorry, it's none of my business.

37:16.685 --> 37:21.095
- No. No, need a wife first.
- Not in this day and age, you don't.

37:21.096 --> 37:25.684
Mm. Look, er, I don't think
there was anything in it,

37:25.685 --> 37:28.364
what Mags was saying about the boy.

37:28.365 --> 37:30.684
To be honest with you,
I felt bad about letting him go.

37:31.191 --> 37:33.191
Put him in Tingwell's way.

37:34.578 --> 37:36.916
Right. Well, thank you for your help.

37:39.685 --> 37:44.684
Yes, Stan helped out here.
But it was only for a few weeks.

37:44.685 --> 37:48.684
Come autumn, he just lit out.
Not seen him since.

37:48.685 --> 37:51.684
He wasn't a great worker, if I'm honest.

37:51.685 --> 37:53.685
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

37:55.205 --> 37:56.684
How do you mean?

37:57.196 --> 38:00.536
- Well, takes after his old man.
- Oh, you knew his father?

38:00.561 --> 38:01.684
Oh, yes.

38:01.685 --> 38:05.524
Phil Clemence and me were choirboys
together at St Christopher's.

38:05.525 --> 38:08.525
Shared our first cigarette
up in the organ loft there.

38:09.517 --> 38:10.716
I bet if I went back today,

38:10.741 --> 38:13.541
I'd find our old pack of Woodbines
still be behind the pipework.

38:14.685 --> 38:17.685
No, it was a bad business.

38:20.685 --> 38:23.684
'What Goes On' by The Velvet Underground

38:47.685 --> 38:52.685
- Er, the door was open.
- It's always open. What do you want?

38:54.365 --> 38:56.684
Some information on Stanley Clemence.

38:56.685 --> 38:58.685
I'm told he's been living here.

38:59.685 --> 39:02.685
- Who wants to know?
- Police. Sergeant Morse.

39:04.685 --> 39:05.796
When did you see him last?

39:07.685 --> 39:11.684
- Couple of days. He came and went.
- Well, I'd like to see his room.

39:12.686 --> 39:15.684
You need a warrant or something,
don't you?

39:16.036 --> 39:18.364
You've got a couple skinning up
on the mattress over there,

39:18.365 --> 39:20.684
and the place reeks of Red Leb.
Do you want me to call

39:20.685 --> 39:22.685
the drugs squad,
or do you want to show me his room?

42:46.348 --> 42:48.988
Go!

43:26.437 --> 43:27.637
Oh!

43:52.437 --> 43:54.437
I don't know
what you've got to come back for.

43:57.984 --> 43:59.344
How do you mean?

44:01.616 --> 44:03.163
There was another copper came by.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.617
What other copper?

44:54.623 --> 44:55.783
So, what's all this?

44:58.617 --> 45:03.970
- What's all what?
- All that. Incognito.

45:04.863 --> 45:07.617
In disguise, or hiding from someone?

45:09.297 --> 45:12.543
- You don't look like you.
- What does me look like?

45:14.282 --> 45:17.178
- Not like this.
- Well, there you go.

45:17.203 --> 45:19.883
Maybe, I'm not me. Not anymore.

45:20.623 --> 45:21.623
Things change.

45:23.729 --> 45:28.063
- Well, that's too bad.
- It's just how it goes. You?

45:30.996 --> 45:34.303
- I'm still me.
- Well, good for you.

45:37.890 --> 45:39.889
- Morse...
- Help! Please!

45:40.203 --> 45:43.722
Somebody help me! Please!
I can't find my little girl.

45:43.723 --> 45:46.203
Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Sorry.

45:47.356 --> 45:49.683
- What is it? What's her name?
- Rosie.

45:49.708 --> 45:50.704
Rosie. What's she wearing?

45:50.729 --> 45:52.863
- A pink dress.
- Right. Right.

46:10.203 --> 46:15.893
- All right, as you were. Ronnie?
- Rosie Johnston, sir. From Cowley.

46:15.894 --> 46:17.646
We've got a sighting
of a man with a little girl

46:17.647 --> 46:19.893
that sounds like Rosie,
stood by a vehicle in the car park.

46:19.894 --> 46:22.413
- Do we have a description?
- Witness didn't see his face,

46:22.414 --> 46:23.893
only that he was wearing a Panama hat.

46:23.894 --> 46:26.574
Doesn't sound like Stanley Clemence.

46:26.575 --> 46:29.241
I've a photograph of Rosie Johnston
for circulation.

46:29.242 --> 46:31.573
- You took your time.
- What about a registration?

46:31.574 --> 46:35.165
Er, just the make. Vanden Plas, two tone.

46:35.166 --> 46:38.536
I've ordered roadblocks, sir.
15 mile perimeter.

46:38.537 --> 46:39.894
Well, that's something, I suppose.

46:39.895 --> 46:41.933
Though, I suspect he'll be long past
any cordon by now.

46:41.934 --> 46:43.894
Unless he's pulled off the road.

46:46.894 --> 46:49.893
Ronnie, I can leave you to liaise
with Chief Superintendent Bright?

46:49.894 --> 46:52.893
Of course, sir.
Very glad of Traffic's assistance.

46:52.894 --> 46:55.893
Hourly despatches, yes? For good or ill.

46:55.894 --> 46:58.894
Find Clemence, find the child.

47:00.894 --> 47:03.893
We don't know that it is Clemence.

47:03.894 --> 47:06.893
Our chief suspect for the abduction
and murder of a little girl

47:06.894 --> 47:09.893
skips hospital, and hours later,
another girl goes missing.

47:09.894 --> 47:11.429
Could be coincidence, couldn't it?

47:11.430 --> 47:13.893
What are you saying, we've got
two perverts on the ground?

47:13.894 --> 47:15.103
Well, it is a possibility.

47:15.894 --> 47:18.733
Unless Clemence had nothing to do
with Ann Kirby.

47:18.734 --> 47:21.651
I mean, I don't suppose anybody's
considered the locus of the body,

47:21.652 --> 47:22.894
or the flowers in her hair?

47:22.895 --> 47:25.413
Listen, this kiddie was taken out
from under the nose

47:25.414 --> 47:28.690
of you and Johnny Morris here,
so I'll have no lectures.

47:28.691 --> 47:30.894
If you'll excuse me.
I have a child to find.

47:34.894 --> 47:37.622
There's evidence
Clemence had Ann Kirby at his place.

47:37.623 --> 47:40.893
- What evidence?
- The blue Alice band she was wearing.

47:40.894 --> 47:43.268
DI Thursday turned it up
not three hours since.

47:43.269 --> 47:45.602
- Where?
- At his place. Now, be told.

47:45.627 --> 47:47.257
But where at his place?

47:47.258 --> 47:48.933
In his room under a loose floorboard.

47:48.934 --> 47:51.894
Along with some drug paraphernalia,
and a notebook.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.520
Fred.

47:55.633 --> 47:56.863
I hate to admit it.

48:27.574 --> 48:29.733
Anything from Traffic?

48:29.734 --> 48:31.543
Not yet.

48:32.094 --> 48:34.893
If there was a blue Alice band
under the floorboards,

48:34.894 --> 48:36.893
it wasn't there when I looked.

48:36.894 --> 48:38.893
You've been there? When?

48:38.894 --> 48:40.893
Well, before you, clearly.

48:40.894 --> 48:42.116
You think I did it?

48:42.117 --> 48:43.893
Well, somebody did.

48:43.894 --> 48:46.893
Whoever it is,
somebody is trying to frame Stanley.

48:46.894 --> 48:48.183
Well...

48:49.343 --> 48:50.893
You keep it to yourself.

48:50.894 --> 48:52.893
Gets back to Box
you've been poking around

48:52.894 --> 48:55.594
- in business that's none of your concern...
- But it is my concern.

48:57.036 --> 48:58.893
He's not gonna get to the bottom
of it, you know that.

48:58.894 --> 49:00.138
He's senior officer.

49:00.139 --> 49:02.063
He's a fist with a warrant card.

49:03.524 --> 49:05.933
He's gonna pin Ann Kirby
on the first passing suspect.

49:05.934 --> 49:07.893
Your boy Stanley. Is that what you want?

49:07.894 --> 49:09.893
You get caught with your tit
in the wringer on this one,

49:09.894 --> 49:12.734
- I won't be able to help you.
- I'm not looking for your help.

49:13.894 --> 49:15.893
How can you stand it?

49:16.223 --> 49:18.894
"Yes, sir, no, sir" to a man like that.

49:19.681 --> 49:20.894
It's called the chain of command.

49:20.895 --> 49:22.894
Well, you're worth a hundred of his sort.

49:23.894 --> 49:25.893
Don't forget it.

49:25.894 --> 49:27.063
Because I won't.

49:40.423 --> 49:42.458
Mister Haynes?

49:42.459 --> 49:44.383
- Yes, sir?
- Can we have a word, please?

49:45.638 --> 49:46.690
Yes, sir.

49:46.691 --> 49:49.893
- Have you always worked round here?
- Mm-hm. Yes, sir. That's right.

49:49.894 --> 49:52.475
Have you ever spent any
time in Berkshire.

49:52.476 --> 49:53.894
On the buses or...?

49:53.895 --> 49:56.893
Nah, Oxford, always have been.

49:56.894 --> 49:58.893
You said when you made your statement

49:58.894 --> 50:01.573
that you couldn't remember
when Ann Kirby got off.

50:01.574 --> 50:04.283
Well, you try driving this route
week in, week out.

50:04.284 --> 50:07.894
They're just uniforms.
They get on, they get off.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.893
But, usually, she would alight
at West Adderbury.

50:12.894 --> 50:15.284
If you say so,
but she can't have done that day.

50:15.285 --> 50:16.413
Why's that?

50:16.414 --> 50:18.715
I was running empty after Weeping Cross.

50:18.716 --> 50:19.894
There was no-one aboard.

50:19.895 --> 50:21.893
Didn't mention that in your statement.

50:21.894 --> 50:23.091
Nobody asked.

50:23.092 --> 50:25.893
Look, man, one day's the same
as the next in this game, you know.

50:25.894 --> 50:28.263
Not every day one of your passengers
goes missing.

50:28.894 --> 50:30.893
You know, thinking about it,

50:30.894 --> 50:33.066
maybe she did get off
at Weeping Cross before.

50:33.067 --> 50:36.414
Not regular, just once in a while.

50:43.894 --> 50:45.894
We've enough to nail Clemence, then.

50:46.894 --> 50:48.254
Just a question of picking him up.

50:48.934 --> 50:50.093
If it's hers.

50:50.094 --> 50:51.893
Course it's hers.

50:51.894 --> 50:53.103
Why wouldn't it be?

50:53.894 --> 50:56.894
Handy, it turning up when it did.

50:58.894 --> 51:00.893
You turned it up, Fred.

51:00.894 --> 51:02.093
Credit where it's due.

51:02.094 --> 51:04.893
You know, it's funny,
we had trouble making it stick

51:04.894 --> 51:05.983
against Stanley's father.

51:07.483 --> 51:08.515
That right?

51:08.516 --> 51:10.893
Couldn't crack him, love nor money.

51:11.143 --> 51:16.551
In the end, it was a young DC,
my old bagman, Arthur Lott,

51:16.552 --> 51:17.894
found the hammer he'd used,

51:17.895 --> 51:21.893
concealed in the cistern
of the outside lav at his address.

51:21.894 --> 51:23.893
- Lucky break.
- Yeah.

51:23.894 --> 51:25.463
Miraculous.

51:25.894 --> 51:28.893
Given it wasn't there when I had
a feel around two days previous.

51:29.303 --> 51:30.894
People miss things.

51:31.894 --> 51:34.143
- Even you.
- That's what I told myself.

51:35.183 --> 51:36.574
It's what did for him, though.

51:37.894 --> 51:40.894
Even so, he went to the gallows
swearing his innocence.

51:45.894 --> 51:46.894
But he wasn't.

51:47.863 --> 51:48.894
Was he?

51:49.894 --> 51:51.463
He was a wrong'un.

51:55.894 --> 51:57.103
So's his boy.

51:58.254 --> 51:59.894
Bad stock.

52:01.574 --> 52:02.894
We don't know he did it.

52:03.894 --> 52:05.503
We never know.

52:05.894 --> 52:07.893
It's a balance of probabilities.

52:07.894 --> 52:09.894
You go with your gut.

52:10.673 --> 52:13.673
What's important
is types like that get put away.

52:14.894 --> 52:18.894
And if we've got to nudge the
jukebox to get the penny to fall?

52:21.223 --> 52:22.894
What are you saying, Fred?

52:23.726 --> 52:25.725
Not sure I'm saying anything.

52:25.750 --> 52:27.749
We're just talking.

52:27.774 --> 52:29.774
Something coming in to Traffic now.

53:00.543 --> 53:02.542
He was picked up
at one of the road blocks.

53:02.543 --> 53:04.542
Been teaching here
for ten years, apparently.

53:05.166 --> 53:07.726
Thought I recognised his name
from your report.

53:35.166 --> 53:36.383
Opium.

53:40.206 --> 53:41.543
What are they doing here?

53:42.543 --> 53:44.543
All hands to the pumps, I thought.

53:45.282 --> 53:46.961
We've got Sheridan in custody.

53:47.223 --> 53:49.542
This is our show, not Banbury's.

53:49.926 --> 53:51.542
The uniform wants to make himself useful,

53:51.543 --> 53:54.383
he can get back on his own ground
and search for the girl.

54:05.543 --> 54:07.542
You should come out to Banbury some time.

54:07.543 --> 54:09.222
I've been to Banbury.

54:09.223 --> 54:11.542
Have a few beers, I meant.

54:11.543 --> 54:12.543
Few beers.

54:12.544 --> 54:14.543
- Curry...
- Talk about George.

54:17.006 --> 54:19.542
- He's still on the books.
- Only for us.

54:19.543 --> 54:21.543
Oh, there is an "us",
then, still, is there?

54:23.543 --> 54:24.543
You're doing well.

54:24.544 --> 54:26.542
You've friends at the Lodge.

54:26.543 --> 54:28.543
You're going places. Just let it go.

54:31.029 --> 54:32.029
I can't.

54:35.443 --> 54:36.766
I can't.

54:43.966 --> 54:45.542
That upstairs.

54:45.543 --> 54:49.542
It don't mean anything,
it's... just his way.

54:49.543 --> 54:51.542
Well, there's a daughter, Sophie.

54:51.543 --> 54:54.126
- You should get Welfare over there.
- Right.

54:54.926 --> 54:58.272
Oh, I went through the items
at 13 Jubilee Row.

54:58.273 --> 54:59.543
You did what?

55:01.166 --> 55:03.543
You can't keep your fingers out, can you?

55:06.543 --> 55:09.300
Brush salesman, wasn't he?
Stanley's father.

55:09.301 --> 55:10.814
- Door to door.
- So?

55:10.815 --> 55:13.542
So I was thinking he should have
a sample case, shouldn't he?

55:13.869 --> 55:14.869
Of brushes.

55:15.046 --> 55:17.288
The past is the past.

55:17.289 --> 55:18.582
Dead and buried.

55:19.006 --> 55:20.326
Done.

55:27.543 --> 55:30.742
A man answering your description,
wearing a Panama hat,

55:30.743 --> 55:33.542
was seen with Rosie at the fair.

55:33.543 --> 55:37.543
Well, there must have been
50 men there wearing Panama hats.

55:41.349 --> 55:43.349
We found your photographs.

55:44.688 --> 55:45.688
Children.

55:46.543 --> 55:49.542
Young girls in not much more
than the altogether.

55:49.543 --> 55:51.542
That's art.

55:51.543 --> 55:53.542
I'm interested in photography.

55:53.543 --> 55:57.542
- You're interested in something.
- Those are historical images.

55:57.543 --> 56:00.542
They were taken
by the Reverend Charles Dodgson.

56:00.926 --> 56:02.542
Lewis Carroll?

56:02.543 --> 56:04.543
The man who wrote Alice In Wonderland?

56:06.543 --> 56:08.222
Prince Albert and Queen Victoria

56:08.223 --> 56:09.542
were great collectors of child nudes.

56:09.543 --> 56:12.382
I doubt they were in the habit
of abducting young girls

56:12.383 --> 56:13.542
from country fetes.

56:13.543 --> 56:14.939
No more am I.

56:14.940 --> 56:19.542
Look, there was a young man
watching my daughter at our house

56:19.543 --> 56:21.902
the night before that, erm,
that Kirby girl was found.

56:21.903 --> 56:23.869
That's the man you should be looking for.

56:23.870 --> 56:26.326
Where were you on the afternoon
of July the 1st?

56:28.543 --> 56:31.245
July the...
Er, I'd need to consult my diary.

56:31.246 --> 56:34.222
The day of the Investiture,
if that helps. Tuesday last.

56:34.223 --> 56:37.542
Oh. Yes, well, in that case,
I was in my rooms.

56:37.543 --> 56:39.742
I watched the ceremony on television.

56:40.046 --> 56:42.382
Anyone who can vouch for you?

56:42.383 --> 56:44.543
Yes. The Bursar at Crozier.

56:52.802 --> 56:55.482
Bursar confirms he spoke to Sheridan.

56:56.442 --> 57:00.961
They talked about the Investiture,
mostly, what The Queen was wearing.

57:00.986 --> 57:03.465
Call was made at 16:23,

57:03.490 --> 57:05.489
line was in use for 26 minutes.

57:05.543 --> 57:07.542
If he was at home talking to Bursar,

57:07.543 --> 57:09.542
he can't've been out
picking up Ann Kirby.

57:09.543 --> 57:11.542
Stand down the warrant for his gaff now.

57:12.126 --> 57:13.542
What about the opium?

57:14.366 --> 57:15.903
Can't prove it's his.

57:17.223 --> 57:19.542
I can't see a jury buying it, can you?

57:19.543 --> 57:21.062
I'm sorry, Fred.

57:21.063 --> 57:23.542
I know you wanted it to be him,
but it's Clemence.

57:23.543 --> 57:25.542
It's always been Clemence.

57:25.543 --> 57:27.383
We've just got to find
the little bastard.

57:57.886 --> 57:59.542
Oh!

58:00.006 --> 58:01.542
Oh, it's nothing sinister.

58:01.543 --> 58:04.086
I was just getting a seed cake
out of the oven.

58:04.886 --> 58:06.543
Well, come in.

58:09.886 --> 58:12.542
Well, this is a first.

58:12.543 --> 58:13.806
Splash more?

58:16.543 --> 58:18.542
How do you know where I live, by the way?

58:18.543 --> 58:19.966
You're in the book.

58:21.543 --> 58:22.543
It's nice.

58:22.544 --> 58:24.542
I am fighting a war of attrition

58:24.543 --> 58:27.086
with the greenfly over the tea roses.

58:27.868 --> 58:31.547
Not very successfully,
it must be said, but yes.

58:31.743 --> 58:34.446
As a spot, I am rather fond.

58:35.543 --> 58:38.542
Well, something has to be lovely,

58:38.543 --> 58:40.223
doesn't it?

58:45.286 --> 58:46.326
Guv'nor.

58:46.351 --> 58:48.098
There's a known pervert
seen back in the area.

58:48.099 --> 58:49.542
Maybe he knows where the boy is.

58:50.166 --> 58:51.542
Maybe.

58:52.286 --> 58:53.742
Look.

58:54.326 --> 58:56.542
This ain't gonna be Geneva Convention.

58:57.246 --> 58:59.542
So if you've got reservations,

58:59.886 --> 59:01.902
now would be the time to say.

59:02.286 --> 59:03.686
Whatever it takes.

59:09.862 --> 59:10.862
I mean it.

59:12.286 --> 59:13.543
Can I count on you?

59:16.326 --> 59:17.886
Always.

59:20.543 --> 59:22.542
Ann Kirby.

59:23.086 --> 59:25.543
I wondered if I had missed anything
in the post-mortem.

59:27.326 --> 59:29.543
Not your case, is it?

59:31.366 --> 59:35.542
Serious head trauma,
hairline fracture of the cranium.

59:35.543 --> 59:39.043
Diffused degeneration
of the cerebral white matter.

59:39.044 --> 59:40.329
Caused by?

59:40.330 --> 59:43.171
A single violent blow
to the back of the skull.

59:43.172 --> 59:45.062
Coup and contrecoup,

59:45.063 --> 59:48.184
the brain bruises across a diffuse area.

59:48.209 --> 59:49.341
Quick?

59:49.366 --> 59:50.806
Not necessarily.

59:51.583 --> 59:55.846
Some patients can lapse into coma
and linger for some time.

59:57.326 --> 59:59.046
What do you think happened to her?

01:00:00.903 --> 01:00:05.886
I think if I spent my days
in contemplation of such questions,

01:00:06.543 --> 01:00:09.086
I would drink rather more than I do.

01:00:21.886 --> 01:00:23.582
Been on your holidays, Gilbert?

01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:25.966
We've been looking for you.

01:00:31.543 --> 01:00:34.806
Rosie!

01:00:41.726 --> 01:00:43.543
Rosie?

01:00:48.006 --> 01:00:49.542
What is this?

01:00:49.926 --> 01:00:52.542
Oh, you know what this is, Gilbert.

01:00:52.543 --> 01:00:54.543
This is how things get done.

01:01:03.543 --> 01:01:05.542
You've got known associates, Gilbert.

01:01:06.206 --> 01:01:09.542
God knows how you freaks find
each other, but I know you do.

01:01:09.966 --> 01:01:13.126
Swapping your nature studies
like cigarette cards.

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:22.166
We're looking for him.

01:01:22.543 --> 01:01:23.743
I don't know him...

01:01:36.543 --> 01:01:38.062
- Urgh!
- Attaboy!

01:01:57.543 --> 01:01:58.543
You want tea?

01:01:59.006 --> 01:02:00.542
You're back, are you?

01:02:01.206 --> 01:02:02.063
Yeah.

01:02:03.543 --> 01:02:05.063
I'm making tea.

01:02:05.064 --> 01:02:06.542
Not for me.

01:02:06.966 --> 01:02:08.486
Righto.

01:02:10.766 --> 01:02:12.686
Gunsmoke, is it?

01:02:13.455 --> 01:02:15.455
I don't know. Something.

01:02:17.063 --> 01:02:18.583
What've you done to your hand?

01:02:20.543 --> 01:02:21.543
Oh.

01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:23.543
I don't remember.

01:02:25.543 --> 01:02:26.726
Caught in a door, probably.

01:02:27.886 --> 01:02:29.543
Doesn't hurt.

01:02:37.543 --> 01:02:39.543
I'll put the kettle on.

01:03:08.543 --> 01:03:10.062
I didn't do it,

01:03:10.063 --> 01:03:13.223
I'm innocent! Thursday!

01:03:44.543 --> 01:03:48.180
'Phil Clemence and me were choirboys
together at St Christopher's.

01:03:48.181 --> 01:03:51.542
'Shared our first cigarette
up in the organ loft there.

01:03:51.543 --> 01:03:52.734
'I bet if I went back today,

01:03:52.735 --> 01:03:55.543
'I'd find our old pack of Woodbines
still behind the pipework.'

01:05:39.613 --> 01:05:43.092
That's the sixth this year.

01:05:43.495 --> 01:05:45.132
Overdose?

01:05:45.133 --> 01:05:48.292
He was a habitual user, but...

01:05:48.293 --> 01:05:49.556
No.

01:05:49.557 --> 01:05:50.930
If he's anything like the others,

01:05:50.931 --> 01:05:53.508
it's what the heroin's
being adulterated with

01:05:53.509 --> 01:05:57.093
to make it go further that's the problem.

01:05:57.813 --> 01:05:59.493
Quinine.

01:06:00.225 --> 01:06:02.224
Not a happy combination.

01:06:02.453 --> 01:06:07.453
And if someone doesn't cut off
the supply, he won't be the last.

01:06:15.093 --> 01:06:16.055
I'm sorry.

01:06:19.739 --> 01:06:21.055
I let him down.

01:06:22.872 --> 01:06:24.552
His father, too.

01:06:25.573 --> 01:06:27.572
Arthur Lott fitted Phil Clemence up.

01:06:27.597 --> 01:06:29.855
And I sent an innocent man
to the gallows.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.700
I've read the casefiles.

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:39.093
There's something you should see.

01:06:52.973 --> 01:06:53.973
Clemence's sample case.

01:06:53.998 --> 01:06:56.135
He had hidden it at St Christopher's.

01:06:56.786 --> 01:06:58.286
So Arthur Lott may have
planted the evidence

01:06:58.311 --> 01:07:01.810
that got him convicted.
But you were right, he was guilty.

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:09.791
That's not how they'll see it upstairs.

01:07:09.816 --> 01:07:11.815
Or in the papers.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.680
You know how it works.

01:07:15.293 --> 01:07:16.792
If I fitted up Phil Clemence,

01:07:16.793 --> 01:07:18.813
who else have I fitted up over the years?

01:07:18.814 --> 01:07:20.813
But you didn't.

01:07:20.814 --> 01:07:22.495
You think that'll matter?

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:29.655
They'll look at every single case
I ever made. We ever made.

01:07:30.854 --> 01:07:34.813
Well, as it stands, nobody knows.

01:07:34.814 --> 01:07:36.015
We know.

01:07:46.494 --> 01:07:48.814
Bury it now, we're no better
than Arthur Lott.

01:07:50.814 --> 01:07:52.814
An Alice band, a hammer.

01:07:53.633 --> 01:07:54.855
It's corruption.

01:07:58.814 --> 01:07:59.814
No.

01:08:03.373 --> 01:08:05.373
Tell the truth and shame the devil.

01:08:09.447 --> 01:08:10.695
I'll turn it in.

01:08:12.814 --> 01:08:14.390
Well, if you want to do things
by the book,

01:08:14.391 --> 01:08:15.814
it's actually in my custody.

01:08:15.815 --> 01:08:19.255
So... I'll take
the responsibility for it.

01:08:30.126 --> 01:08:32.126
Any news on Rosie Johnston?

01:08:34.246 --> 01:08:35.246
Were still looking.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.613
If Stanley took her...

01:08:38.638 --> 01:08:40.175
She's still alive.

01:08:40.814 --> 01:08:42.803
Stanley didn't take her
any more than he killed Ann Kirby.

01:08:42.804 --> 01:08:44.734
You know that and I know that.

01:08:48.814 --> 01:08:50.814
I'd better get back to the nick.

01:09:41.814 --> 01:09:43.255
Mr Croglin?

01:09:43.814 --> 01:09:45.215
That's right, yeah.

01:09:45.654 --> 01:09:48.013
Sergeant Morse, Thames Valley.

01:09:48.014 --> 01:09:50.265
You had a stall at Blenheim Fete.

01:09:50.265 --> 01:09:52.173
Yeah, that's right. What's this about?

01:09:52.174 --> 01:09:54.166
Do you ever do any work in Berkshire?

01:09:54.167 --> 01:09:56.814
No, I've all I can manage here.

01:09:57.814 --> 01:09:58.853
But you took this.

01:09:58.854 --> 01:10:01.813
Er, yeah, yeah.

01:10:01.814 --> 01:10:05.427
And do you remember this little girl?

01:10:05.428 --> 01:10:07.175
From the photo you took here last week.

01:10:09.574 --> 01:10:11.573
That's the girl that was killed,
isn't it?

01:10:12.415 --> 01:10:13.975
My little bookworm.

01:10:15.814 --> 01:10:16.895
How's that?

01:10:18.567 --> 01:10:20.566
Well, I'd had to change a roll, see,

01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:22.416
so I had a couple more minutes with her.

01:10:22.441 --> 01:10:23.455
Mm-hm.

01:10:24.413 --> 01:10:26.535
She was telling me
that she was reading, erm...

01:10:27.455 --> 01:10:28.813
Black Beauty.

01:10:28.814 --> 01:10:31.813
I said, "Oh, yeah, that's nice".
You know, just to make conversation.

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:33.814
She said yeah.

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:37.813
Only, she was worried.

01:10:38.175 --> 01:10:39.813
About what?

01:10:39.814 --> 01:10:40.814
Erm...

01:10:40.815 --> 01:10:44.814
As it's quite a long book, you see.

01:10:45.814 --> 01:10:47.316
She wouldn't be able to get finished

01:10:47.317 --> 01:10:48.853
before it had to be back to the library.

01:10:48.854 --> 01:10:52.813
I said, "You'll have to buy a copy".

01:10:52.814 --> 01:10:57.654
She said, "I'm not made of money".

01:10:58.593 --> 01:10:59.975
Just like that.

01:11:02.306 --> 01:11:04.146
"I'm not made of money."

01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:06.380
We rolled up.

01:11:08.533 --> 01:11:10.053
Anyway...

01:11:12.513 --> 01:11:13.513
That was...

01:11:14.814 --> 01:11:16.175
My little bookworm.

01:11:35.014 --> 01:11:37.853
The last time you would have
been here was when?

01:11:37.854 --> 01:11:40.813
- Was it the 1st of July?
- That's right.

01:11:40.814 --> 01:11:42.813
Can you tell me
if this girl came by that day?

01:11:42.814 --> 01:11:44.814
Her name's Ann Kirby.

01:11:45.814 --> 01:11:47.814
If you give me a minute.

01:11:51.814 --> 01:11:53.578
Do you stop in Deddington?

01:11:53.579 --> 01:11:55.312
No, that's not on the rota.

01:11:55.313 --> 01:11:57.813
Weeping Cross is the nearest we come.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:59.173
Yes, here we are.

01:11:59.174 --> 01:12:00.814
Ann Kirby.

01:12:01.814 --> 01:12:03.675
Returned four books, took out four more.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:04.813
Four?

01:12:04.814 --> 01:12:06.237
Mm-hm.

01:12:06.238 --> 01:12:08.579
Caring For Your Pony, Ride Like The Wind,

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.855
Blue Ribbon for Binky
and Gypsy Wins Through.

01:12:12.553 --> 01:12:13.753
Four books every visit.

01:12:15.014 --> 01:12:16.415
Like clockwork.

01:13:34.659 --> 01:13:36.975
I carried a little boy
out of a bloodbath.

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:40.814
That's got to mean something.

01:13:42.814 --> 01:13:45.375
Guilty or innocent,
I can't give up on him.

01:13:46.814 --> 01:13:49.187
So you returned to the scene
of the crime.

01:13:49.188 --> 01:13:50.814
Hoping for what?

01:13:51.255 --> 01:13:52.814
That the killer would return?

01:13:54.567 --> 01:13:57.015
- Sometimes they come back.
- Sometimes they do.

01:13:58.607 --> 01:14:00.287
But this isn't the scene of the crime.

01:14:01.146 --> 01:14:03.625
You were right, I was wrong.

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:05.334
There is no obscure motive.

01:14:06.087 --> 01:14:07.975
No stroke of genius.

01:14:08.494 --> 01:14:09.814
Just shoe-leather.

01:14:10.694 --> 01:14:12.693
Little girl goes missing, turns up dead,

01:14:12.718 --> 01:14:14.718
one thought springs to mind.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.135
99 times out of 100, it's the right one.

01:14:18.814 --> 01:14:20.814
But not this time?

01:14:37.086 --> 01:14:39.086
Mr Skynner?

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.299
Detective Inspector Thursday,
Thames Valley.

01:14:42.324 --> 01:14:44.324
I believe you know Sergeant Morse.

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:47.813
It's about the girl
found in the pylon field.

01:14:48.575 --> 01:14:50.173
Oh, yes.

01:14:50.174 --> 01:14:51.813
The day Anne Kirby disappeared,

01:14:51.814 --> 01:14:53.813
she got off the bus a few stops early

01:14:53.814 --> 01:14:55.813
to return books to the mobile library,

01:14:55.814 --> 01:14:57.814
where she collected four more.

01:15:02.255 --> 01:15:04.813
I checked to see which would be
the best shortcut

01:15:04.814 --> 01:15:06.410
from Weeping Cross to her home.

01:15:06.411 --> 01:15:08.853
There's a field with a lane.

01:15:08.854 --> 01:15:11.375
With a very nasty blind bend.

01:15:40.814 --> 01:15:43.394
I recovered a piece of an L-Plate there,

01:15:43.395 --> 01:15:45.333
broken off in a collision.

01:15:45.334 --> 01:15:46.813
Alfie?

01:15:46.814 --> 01:15:48.427
It's all right, Mags, go home.
See to Laurel.

01:15:48.428 --> 01:15:50.781
Actually, it's probably
best if you stay here.

01:15:50.806 --> 01:15:51.813
Please.

01:15:51.814 --> 01:15:53.380
I'm sorry, Mr Skynner.

01:15:53.381 --> 01:15:55.814
What's going on, Alf?

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.015
They know who was driving.

01:16:00.814 --> 01:16:02.814
It was an accident.

01:16:03.587 --> 01:16:04.814
She was just there.

01:16:04.815 --> 01:16:06.340
I wasn't going fast.

01:16:06.341 --> 01:16:09.124
- There was nothing I could do.
- She panicked, that's all it was.

01:16:09.125 --> 01:16:13.814
I thought if I brought her back,
Alf could do something.

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:15.853
Make her right.

01:16:16.495 --> 01:16:18.204
Only she never came to.

01:16:18.205 --> 01:16:19.814
We thought that she'd come round.

01:16:20.814 --> 01:16:22.653
Then, the longer it went on...

01:16:22.654 --> 01:16:25.295
She just slipped away.

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:29.173
I went to get her a cold flannel.
I couldn't have been gone a minute.

01:16:29.495 --> 01:16:31.814
She just slipped away.

01:16:34.814 --> 01:16:36.493
I knew the maintenance gang
were gonna be out

01:16:36.494 --> 01:16:37.814
seeing to the pylons.

01:16:38.814 --> 01:16:40.814
I thought that they'd find her.

01:16:41.814 --> 01:16:44.371
They skipped over to the next valley.

01:16:44.372 --> 01:16:46.305
So you put the horse in the field,

01:16:46.306 --> 01:16:48.813
knowing that Mr Tingwell
would report it stolen?

01:16:48.814 --> 01:16:51.174
I didn't want her lying out there.

01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:53.813
With animals and all sorts.

01:16:53.814 --> 01:16:54.814
I didn't...

01:16:55.215 --> 01:16:56.814
I didn't want her messing with.

01:16:58.193 --> 01:16:59.335
For her parents.

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:01.814
And you put the flowers in her hair?

01:17:04.687 --> 01:17:06.687
I thought I'd get in trouble.

01:17:07.433 --> 01:17:09.895
Laurel, our daughter...

01:17:11.166 --> 01:17:15.375
With Alf working... I'm all she's got.

01:18:02.295 --> 01:18:03.814
Well...

01:18:05.627 --> 01:18:07.627
Who's a clever bastard?

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.579
They're nothing to do with
Rosie Johnston.

01:18:10.814 --> 01:18:12.813
Well, seeing as Stanley's
cooling in the fridge,

01:18:12.814 --> 01:18:14.814
we've still got some work to do
to find her.

01:18:16.455 --> 01:18:18.014
Fred.

01:18:49.968 --> 01:18:50.968
What's this?

01:18:52.968 --> 01:18:56.613
Well, I wouldn't swear to it,
as one looks much like another,

01:18:56.614 --> 01:19:00.967
but I'd say that was
Ann Kirby's Alice band.

01:19:00.968 --> 01:19:02.968
It was under the driver's seat.

01:19:03.662 --> 01:19:05.662
Must've fallen off when they...

01:19:06.881 --> 01:19:08.586
...got her out of the car.

01:19:13.386 --> 01:19:15.968
We didn't have the best of starts.

01:19:18.555 --> 01:19:20.306
But I hope we can straighten that out.

01:19:21.968 --> 01:19:23.026
Bury the hatchet.

01:19:24.328 --> 01:19:26.746
You got a raw deal over George Fancy.

01:19:27.968 --> 01:19:29.968
Everybody knows that.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:34.266
It's you should be sitting here,
and me standing there.

01:19:35.788 --> 01:19:37.106
How it goes.

01:19:37.968 --> 01:19:39.426
Maybe.

01:19:41.968 --> 01:19:44.266
But it doesn't make my job any easier.

01:19:45.801 --> 01:19:47.800
You're Fred Thursday.

01:19:48.181 --> 01:19:50.181
That means something to these blokes.

01:19:51.968 --> 01:19:53.968
I don't know about that.

01:19:55.968 --> 01:19:57.808
I do.

01:19:59.968 --> 01:20:00.968
Look.

01:20:02.648 --> 01:20:04.808
My manners aren't all they should be.

01:20:05.874 --> 01:20:08.873
But everything I've got in this
game has come through this

01:20:08.898 --> 01:20:10.418
and hard graft.

01:20:11.454 --> 01:20:12.906
And I reckon you're the same.

01:20:17.968 --> 01:20:19.968
We can do something here.

01:20:20.741 --> 01:20:21.741
You and me.

01:20:22.666 --> 01:20:25.967
Sort this place out,
make it somewhere decent.

01:20:26.386 --> 01:20:28.488
Kids can grow up safe.

01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:31.855
But I need your help.

01:20:35.968 --> 01:20:37.328
You in?

01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:40.701
Or out?

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:14.507
Oh. Sir?

01:21:14.508 --> 01:21:16.167
- Morse?
- It's her.

01:21:16.168 --> 01:21:17.967
- Who?
- Emily Bayard.

01:21:17.968 --> 01:21:19.967
The missing school girl.

01:21:19.968 --> 01:21:22.967
He's using her as a model,
and period photographic techniques

01:21:22.968 --> 01:21:24.755
to pass the images off
as vintage photographs.

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:26.114
- Who is?
- Doctor Sheridan.

01:21:26.115 --> 01:21:27.967
That photograph's a fake.

01:21:27.968 --> 01:21:30.491
- Looks like a photograph to me.
- No, I mean it's inauthentic.

01:21:30.492 --> 01:21:33.483
If you look at the sculpture
on the plinth, it's by Degas.

01:21:33.484 --> 01:21:36.186
Couldn't have been cast
until the early 20th century.

01:21:36.549 --> 01:21:38.967
That's not Victorian,
that was made about three years ago.

01:21:38.968 --> 01:21:40.017
How do you know?

01:21:40.042 --> 01:21:42.992
Because the girl in the
picture is Emily Bayard.

01:21:43.968 --> 01:21:45.186
Sophie.

01:21:45.648 --> 01:21:48.430
- Sheridan's so-called daughter.
- So-called?

01:21:48.431 --> 01:21:49.968
Yeah, it's the same girl.

01:21:54.968 --> 01:21:56.967
- Emily?
- Emily!

01:21:56.968 --> 01:21:58.967
Emily, it's the police.

01:21:58.968 --> 01:22:00.968
You're safe now.

01:22:01.968 --> 01:22:03.276
- It was here.
- What was?

01:22:03.277 --> 01:22:05.327
The statue. He must
have taken it with him.

01:22:05.328 --> 01:22:07.451
- Where?
- Wherever he takes the photographs.

01:22:07.452 --> 01:22:10.808
Presumably where he stashed Rosie
after he took her from the fete.

01:22:14.968 --> 01:22:16.968
Trapped in an upstairs room.

01:22:20.106 --> 01:22:21.567
She's a bit...

01:22:21.568 --> 01:22:22.968
It's all right.

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:24.967
You're all right.

01:22:24.968 --> 01:22:27.438
Nobody's going to hurt you.

01:22:27.439 --> 01:22:29.226
You're safe now.

01:22:31.306 --> 01:22:33.968
Where is he, Emily?

01:22:48.265 --> 01:22:49.967
What is this place?

01:22:49.968 --> 01:22:51.967
Badgett Manor, former church land.

01:22:51.968 --> 01:22:54.967
Sheridan was a local history buff,
He knew all about the place.

01:22:54.968 --> 01:22:56.968
He knew it would be empty.

01:23:42.968 --> 01:23:44.968
Rosie?

01:23:57.968 --> 01:23:59.967
She's... She's perfectly all right.

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.967
She'd better be. Morse?

01:24:01.968 --> 01:24:02.968
Laudanum.

01:24:02.969 --> 01:24:04.007
A sedative.

01:24:04.008 --> 01:24:06.648
I can assure you, she's quite unharmed.

01:24:07.968 --> 01:24:09.167
And Emily?

01:24:09.706 --> 01:24:12.967
Three years your captive,
and God knows what else.

01:24:12.968 --> 01:24:14.167
How harmed is she?

01:24:14.586 --> 01:24:16.967
It's... It's just photographs.

01:24:16.968 --> 01:24:18.967
You take the photographs, and what?

01:24:18.968 --> 01:24:20.741
You sell them on to other freaks?

01:24:20.742 --> 01:24:22.967
Freaks? No, hobbyists.

01:24:22.968 --> 01:24:24.967
Men of a like aesthetic bent.

01:24:24.968 --> 01:24:25.866
Men?

01:24:26.946 --> 01:24:28.967
You're not a man.
You're not a man's arse.

01:24:28.968 --> 01:24:31.647
- I've never laid a finger...
- Perhaps.

01:24:31.648 --> 01:24:33.473
But what did you intend to do with her?

01:24:33.474 --> 01:24:35.967
Just sell her off to the highest bidder?

01:24:35.968 --> 01:24:37.967
And that's why you took Rosie,

01:24:37.968 --> 01:24:40.968
because you needed a new model,
because Emily had grown up.

01:24:42.762 --> 01:24:45.121
She was... perfect.

01:24:46.066 --> 01:24:48.648
Sugar and spice...

01:24:49.968 --> 01:24:51.968
And all...

01:24:53.648 --> 01:24:54.967
...things nice.

01:24:54.968 --> 01:24:57.487
- Oof!
- Woah! Woah!

01:24:57.488 --> 01:24:58.620
That's enough, that's enough!

01:24:58.621 --> 01:25:00.266
That's enough.

01:25:12.968 --> 01:25:14.546
All right, Rosie.

01:25:16.968 --> 01:25:19.968
Now then,
hand you over to this lady here.

01:25:20.555 --> 01:25:22.555
She's gonna take you home. All right?

01:25:27.621 --> 01:25:30.620
I expect he lied to Rosie
the same way he lied to Emily.

01:25:30.968 --> 01:25:32.967
Told her her parents were dead,

01:25:32.968 --> 01:25:34.522
that she was gonna come and live with him

01:25:34.523 --> 01:25:36.648
and she wouldn't have to
go to school anymore.

01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:38.466
Sick bastard.

01:25:42.266 --> 01:25:44.007
She'll be all right.

01:25:44.008 --> 01:25:45.968
They both will.

01:25:47.215 --> 01:25:49.215
Like Stanley?

01:25:53.428 --> 01:25:55.068
I'll see you around.

01:26:05.968 --> 01:26:08.575
Transfer I asked about, sir.

01:26:08.576 --> 01:26:10.968
If I could trouble you for a signature.

01:26:11.968 --> 01:26:15.401
- E Morse, He's, erm...
- Oh, yes, sir.

01:26:15.402 --> 01:26:17.968
One of the college lodges, I believe.

01:26:19.488 --> 01:26:20.967
Thank you, sir.

01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:22.967
"Dear Mr E Morse,
