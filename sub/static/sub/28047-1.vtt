WEBVTT

00:30.160 --> 00:31.170
Walk him out.

00:31.190 --> 00:33.060
? I bring the drum out and dump
it

00:45.040 --> 00:46.180
? That's the third time you've
been got

01:16.040 --> 01:18.070
Get out of the van now!

01:18.090 --> 01:20.220
-All right, all right.
-Move, move!

01:21.000 --> 01:22.160
All right, all right,
I'm moving!

01:35.130 --> 01:36.130
Let's go!

01:42.090 --> 01:43.100
What about the money?

01:43.120 --> 01:45.080
As soon as he's a safe distance
from here,

01:45.120 --> 01:47.050
you'll both get what was
promised.

01:47.070 --> 01:49.190
Hammond, we gotta go!

02:00.050 --> 02:02.230
Right now! Right now!

02:34.030 --> 02:35.060
Don't give me that look.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.170
I turned a shit situation
into a pay day.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.200
A job as dangerous as this is
worth more

02:40.000 --> 02:41.200
than just getting that gun back.

02:41.220 --> 02:44.000
Deal was we break him out.
Why are we still with 'em?

02:44.020 --> 02:46.170
Until he lands somewhere safe,
the job's not over.

02:48.190 --> 02:49.220
What the fuck...

02:51.160 --> 02:52.230
Must be an accident.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.060
We got a possible issue
in the number three lane.

03:04.050 --> 03:05.160
Yeah, I see 'em.

03:05.180 --> 03:08.120
- Think they do?
- Let the other cars know.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.090
Two in front, one in back.

03:18.160 --> 03:22.010
Heads up. We might have company.

03:25.090 --> 03:27.030
Let the
Ravens handle this.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.100
Eyes.

03:45.030 --> 03:47.060
Tell Steve it opens up
once we get past this truck.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.160
Go!

04:04.180 --> 04:05.180
Get down! Get down!

04:06.140 --> 04:07.140
Don't move!

04:09.120 --> 04:10.150
Son of a...

04:14.090 --> 04:15.090
Shit!

04:17.050 --> 04:18.170
Get everyone to our father!

04:31.070 --> 04:32.110
Target the third SUV.

04:50.220 --> 04:52.120
Get out! Get out!

04:52.140 --> 04:54.010
Move out!

05:02.070 --> 05:03.120
Get up!

05:04.190 --> 05:06.010
They got Cole!

05:07.180 --> 05:09.030
Nobody move or
we shoot him.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.080
Who the hell were they?

05:43.100 --> 05:44.160
-Ramos.
-Yo.

05:44.180 --> 05:45.220
Check with dispatch and make
sure

05:46.030 --> 05:47.050
nothing from that freeway

05:47.070 --> 05:49.020
-is leading the field units back
to us.

05:49.060 --> 05:49.150
-Copy.

05:49.170 --> 05:52.000
The rest of you get over
to the street fair and

05:52.040 --> 05:52.180
socialize.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.050
Make sure they see your face
and remember you were there.

05:58.170 --> 05:59.170
Listen...

06:02.000 --> 06:03.080
this wasn't about the money.

06:04.180 --> 06:06.000
No!

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
We needed that gun back
and now you've muddied the

06:13.040 --> 06:13.130
waters!

06:13.160 --> 06:14.170
All right...

06:16.030 --> 06:17.070
so I got them to sweeten the
deal

06:17.120 --> 06:18.160
for a couple hundred grand.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.050
And why not?
The club needs the money.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.030
You're being played.
We can't do this.

06:24.020 --> 06:27.000
You were voted out four months

06:27.040 --> 06:27.140
ago.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.010
Your dad is sick of this shit
and fucked off.

06:30.030 --> 06:32.000
So I run this now. Not you.

06:33.170 --> 06:36.010
We just gotta find the pricks
that took Ignacio...

06:36.220 --> 06:38.100
and then we can get
their father back.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.180
Hey...

06:46.190 --> 06:48.210
I'm just fixing what
you fucked up.

07:02.060 --> 07:04.100
? From nothin' to somethin'
Who'd ever thought that we'd

07:09.210 --> 07:11.200
-Come on.
It's for the community, people.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.160
-Thank you.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.080
Hey, we got a bogie at our nine,
Carl.

07:17.030 --> 07:19.100
Hey! Alligator arms.
Free to the public only.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.100
You better find a way
to reach those pockets for a

07:21.140 --> 07:21.210
donation

07:21.230 --> 07:23.060
if you take that goddamn burger.

07:23.090 --> 07:25.200
-Put it on my tab?
-I ain't running any tabs.

07:25.220 --> 07:28.220
Good. Because I wouldn't pay it,
if you were.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.110
Save that smile for Kraley.

07:37.140 --> 07:39.100
He's the one you gotta impress,
not that prick.

07:39.230 --> 07:41.030
All right.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.000
Let's go, folks.

07:43.150 --> 07:45.130
We should've known
that shit was gonna go south.

07:45.150 --> 07:47.230
Look, I don't like it anymore
than you do,

07:48.030 --> 07:49.140
but Kraley's in charge.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.070
Now, you making yourself noticed
like Steve said?

07:53.100 --> 07:55.000
Without pissing people off.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.010
We're the good guys,
remember that.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.050
-Hey, how's it going?
-Hey.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.110
What can I get you, ma'am?

08:10.130 --> 08:13.110
Uh, well, this little man
would love a burger. Well done.

08:14.040 --> 08:17.110
OK. Well done, coming right up.

08:22.140 --> 08:23.230
-Here you go, little man, well
done.

08:24.030 --> 08:24.160
-Thank you!

08:24.180 --> 08:26.170
You're welcome.
And what about mom?

08:26.210 --> 08:28.010
You need anything?

08:28.060 --> 08:29.180
Oh, he's not mine.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.100
Oh, good to hear.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.060
Excuse me?

08:33.230 --> 08:36.090
No, I meant... just nice to
know.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.080
You know, that's all.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.210
If the two of you are done,
the rest of us are hungry too.

08:42.060 --> 08:44.120
-Name's Amber.
-My name is Cole.

08:45.070 --> 08:48.020
And I'm single.
I'm just saying, Amber.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.160
All right, bye now...

08:51.210 --> 08:53.070
I'll take mine well done.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.100
Oh, man... what you did
right there, man,

08:56.120 --> 08:57.110
I mean that was a straight up
block.

08:57.150 --> 08:58.030
You know that?

08:59.020 --> 09:01.080
-A block?
-Yeah, a block, you know what

09:01.120 --> 09:02.060
I'm saying.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.130
No. I'm not quite sure I do.

09:05.090 --> 09:07.100
And since that's my daughter
we're talking about,

09:08.120 --> 09:10.000
why don't you explain it to me.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.030
-Hey, uh... you got a sec?
-What?

09:20.090 --> 09:23.030
Y'know, anything you need,
I got you.

09:23.140 --> 09:24.210
I'm down for the Ravens.

09:25.220 --> 09:28.040
-OK.
-I mean it.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.050
Hey, leave the man alone
and go flip some burgers.

09:34.110 --> 09:35.110
Yeah.

09:36.230 --> 09:39.100
-What the hell was that?
-She wants ink.

09:39.210 --> 09:41.180
You don't just come
out and ask it.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.210
-She knows that, right?
-Yeah.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.110
What?

09:47.130 --> 09:48.200
My back.

09:49.220 --> 09:52.080
-Man up. It's not that heavy.
-I've got a blown disc.

09:52.220 --> 09:56.100
-Then get it taken care of.
-I am. Going next week.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.060
Yeah?
Make sure your replacement's

09:58.100 --> 09:59.210
better looking than you.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.200
I just want to thank you and the
station

10:07.000 --> 10:08.170
for participating in this.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.090
No worries.
Just our way of showing

10:10.130 --> 10:11.210
we support the community.

10:12.060 --> 10:13.230
Do you?
Because I still hear stories

10:14.030 --> 10:15.050
in the neighborhood

10:15.070 --> 10:17.090
about people being
jacked by cops.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.070
- Jacked?
- Profiled.

10:19.090 --> 10:21.140
Stopped and searched
without probable cause.

10:21.160 --> 10:25.030
Excessive force used on them...
Should I go on?

10:25.220 --> 10:27.220
Change starts with dialogue.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.180
And that's why we're here,

10:30.090 --> 10:33.090
make sure that both sides
see each other as people,

10:33.110 --> 10:34.200
not stereotypes.

10:36.110 --> 10:38.150
And all the money goes back
to the community.

10:39.010 --> 10:40.150
Specifically, your church.

10:40.220 --> 10:42.010
And we appreciate that...

10:43.130 --> 10:47.100
but some would say
that money isn't a Band-Aid

10:47.120 --> 10:49.130
for a generation of abuses.

10:51.170 --> 10:53.170
Then we'll just
have

10:53.210 --> 10:55.170
to keep doing more, won't we?

10:55.190 --> 10:57.210
I sincerely hope you will.

11:02.050 --> 11:04.060
Colombian
friends want to talk.

11:10.130 --> 11:11.170
If they wanted him
dead,

11:11.210 --> 11:13.100
they would've killed him on the
spot.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.160
Someone's gonna call and ask for
a ransom.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.020
I'll put money on it.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.160
Yeah, that's why we're here.

11:21.150 --> 11:23.140
Maybe you already
know who has him?

11:24.170 --> 11:25.190
What does that mean?

11:26.130 --> 11:28.140
They knew he was
being broken out,

11:28.160 --> 11:31.120
and only my men got shot
when he was taken.

11:31.150 --> 11:33.230
Bullshit.
We had nothing to do with it.

11:34.190 --> 11:36.130
None of our people talked.

11:36.150 --> 11:39.030
-They're both lying.
-Stay the fuck out of this.

11:50.220 --> 11:54.210
We want him back.
No questions asked.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.000
We don't know who did it.

11:58.190 --> 12:00.050
You don't know?

12:04.170 --> 12:06.120
I will pay five million if you
find out

12:06.160 --> 12:08.120
who did, and bring him back to
me.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.120
Make it ten.

12:16.130 --> 12:18.120
No.

12:20.060 --> 12:22.020
How do we know you'll pay up
if we do find him?

12:30.140 --> 12:32.000
I will pay you your money.

12:32.150 --> 12:34.010
You have my word on that.

12:34.030 --> 12:37.030
We don't know you.
And your word means nothing to

12:37.070 --> 12:37.140
us.

12:37.160 --> 12:42.080
So, until we get that gun back,
we're not doing anything. Hmm?

12:42.100 --> 12:43.140
You want a gun!

12:44.190 --> 12:46.160
How's mine, huh?

12:52.100 --> 12:57.010
I never break my word as long
as obligations are met.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.200
Find my father, Kraley.

13:08.200 --> 13:12.000
One in the head.
Just like I did with your FBI

13:12.040 --> 13:12.220
friend...

13:20.000 --> 13:22.170
I'll find you. I'll find you.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.130
Five million reasons.

13:36.170 --> 13:37.160
That's why.

13:37.180 --> 13:39.070
Yeah, if they pay.

13:39.130 --> 13:41.110
He's their father.
Head of the cartel.

13:41.150 --> 13:42.090
They'll pay.

13:45.190 --> 13:48.070
Hey, what's she doing here?

13:51.140 --> 13:53.050
Steve said he's got unfinished
business

13:53.090 --> 13:53.200
with her.

14:02.170 --> 14:05.130
Come in.

14:15.090 --> 14:17.040
Thanks for coming, Tara.

14:17.060 --> 14:20.000
When I reached out to you,
it was for answers.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.100
You promised me you had some.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.080
So tell me... what
happened that night?

14:33.040 --> 14:37.010
The report was true.
It was Russian gangsters.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.070
They tortured us for information
about a bust we made...

14:40.220 --> 14:42.070
and when they didn't like the
answers,

14:42.120 --> 14:43.070
they killed Damon.

14:43.090 --> 14:47.070
But listen, we will find the guy
that killed him.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.070
And we will get justice.
I promise.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.220
Well, then, answer
me honestly...

14:53.090 --> 14:55.060
were you helping him in the RICO
case?

14:55.100 --> 14:57.030
Or were you the reason for it?

14:57.140 --> 14:59.030
Well, right now we need each
other.

14:59.070 --> 15:00.030
You understand?

15:02.030 --> 15:03.030
We helped him.

15:04.060 --> 15:05.100
To help ourselves.

15:07.170 --> 15:09.030
So then, why not just tell me
this

15:09.070 --> 15:10.210
over the phone.
Why ask me here?

15:13.090 --> 15:14.090
What is this?

15:14.190 --> 15:16.210
We collected some money in
Damon's memory.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.010
That cashier's check is
what we raised.

15:24.070 --> 15:26.060
No, this is a lot of money.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.080
Keep it.

15:28.130 --> 15:30.200
If you don't need it now,
save it for your son's college

15:31.000 --> 15:31.070
fund.

15:35.030 --> 15:36.100
Damon would've wanted that.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.080
Please.

15:54.190 --> 15:56.010
I thought I smelled
something bad.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.030
That hurts.

15:57.050 --> 15:58.170
-No, it doesn't.
-Oh, come on, you miss riding

15:58.210 --> 15:59.050
with me?

15:59.070 --> 16:01.080
- Admit it.
- Don't flatter yourself.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.040
I was glad to go back to
a one-man car.

16:03.150 --> 16:05.110
Especially when I found out
you were transferring to the rat

16:05.150 --> 16:05.210
squad.

16:05.230 --> 16:08.030
Yeah? Well, when you hear this,
you're gonna be happy I did.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.090
A reporter called,

16:10.140 --> 16:12.140
looking for an official comment
on a story they're about to

16:12.180 --> 16:13.000
drop.

16:13.190 --> 16:14.190
What kind of story?

16:15.160 --> 16:17.130
An exposé on cop gangs.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.180
-Are you shitting me?
-I wish I was.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.090
But they mentioned you
specifically.

16:21.130 --> 16:23.090
The police commission is freaked
out.

16:23.140 --> 16:25.100
I mean, obviously it's bad
for the department's image.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.110
They're gonna come in here
and snatch all of your badges

16:27.130 --> 16:28.160
just to cover their asses.

16:28.180 --> 16:29.190
Who's the reporter?

16:30.110 --> 16:33.050
I-I can't tell you that.
We both know what you're gonna

16:33.090 --> 16:33.150
do.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.160
All right?
That's only gonna make

16:34.200 --> 16:35.070
things worse.

16:35.090 --> 16:36.090
Come on.

16:36.170 --> 16:37.230
I covered for your ass
a ton of times.

16:38.030 --> 16:38.210
Give me something.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.160
Like what?

16:41.180 --> 16:42.180
Anything.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.000
-Who's the source?
-I don't know.

16:45.090 --> 16:46.090
Bullshit.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.020
I don't.

16:49.030 --> 16:50.180
But for you I can find out.

16:58.040 --> 17:02.010
Goodbye!

17:04.050 --> 17:05.160
Oops. Oh!

17:05.190 --> 17:06.210
Hey,  princesa.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
Hey.

17:15.010 --> 17:19.020
Why don't you go into your room,
and let your father and me talk,

17:19.060 --> 17:19.130
OK?

17:19.150 --> 17:21.100
We don't need to talk.
I'm here to see my daughter.

17:21.140 --> 17:21.230
Not you.

17:22.010 --> 17:23.010
Yeah, and you will.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.040
After we talk.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.140
Go,  mija , go.

17:28.120 --> 17:30.140
It's OK,  princesa .
I'll be right there.

17:37.070 --> 17:38.120
This is bullshit.

17:39.010 --> 17:40.020
Don't you ever talk to me like
that

17:40.060 --> 17:41.080
in front of my daughter again.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.020
I talk to you the way I have to.

17:43.130 --> 17:46.130
What happened to Don Ignacio,
it's all over the news.

17:46.150 --> 17:48.040
I wouldn't know
anything about that. Or care.

17:48.060 --> 17:49.100
Come on, Pete, don't lie to me.

17:49.180 --> 17:52.140
Not if that little girl means
as much to you as you say she

17:52.180 --> 17:53.020
does.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.080
Huh?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.120
You think we want to be
in their debt?

17:59.040 --> 18:00.040
You did this to us.

18:00.060 --> 18:02.090
If I hadn't stepped in, you
and the other Ravens would all

18:02.130 --> 18:02.230
be dead.

18:03.010 --> 18:04.220
You didn't save our lives,
you sold them.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.020
We done here?

18:10.020 --> 18:11.140
By now you know what these
people

18:11.180 --> 18:12.230
are capable of, right?

18:17.160 --> 18:20.000
They might hurt Veronica
if they felt it necessary.

18:20.020 --> 18:22.040
-No, that will never happen.
-You're wrong, Pete.

18:22.130 --> 18:24.060
As long as you remain in her
life,

18:24.100 --> 18:26.090
that will always be a
possibility.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.010
Veronica's happy here.

18:29.130 --> 18:32.120
But most importantly,
she is safe.

18:35.010 --> 18:36.080
You took my wife...

18:37.080 --> 18:39.230
I will not allow you
to take my daughter as well.

18:50.180 --> 18:52.150
? If you don't do it somebody
else can

18:54.080 --> 18:55.230
You had no right giving
her our money!

18:56.010 --> 18:58.060
- We've got nothing now.
- What?

18:59.080 --> 19:01.000
I gave Byrd's widow
a hundred grand from the

19:01.040 --> 19:01.140
pension.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.140
-We owed it to him.
-The hell we did!

19:04.160 --> 19:05.230
And that ain't the worst of it.

19:06.170 --> 19:08.160
Article's coming out
about cop gangs.

19:08.180 --> 19:10.050
-Specifically mentioning the
Ravens.

19:10.090 --> 19:11.180
-And specifically naming her.

19:12.010 --> 19:14.100
-Why you?
-We're working on finding out.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.210
Maybe it's because
she keeps pissin' everybody off.

19:16.230 --> 19:18.200
- I give it how I live it.
- Enough.

19:21.140 --> 19:23.030
Even though he pissing away our
pension,

19:23.070 --> 19:25.040
and she's dragging us into a
shit-storm...

19:26.030 --> 19:27.190
-there's still a silver lining
to this.

19:27.230 --> 19:29.050
-Bullshit.
We're screwed.

19:29.070 --> 19:31.040
So what if we are?

19:31.060 --> 19:32.060
Who needs badges?
We get that

19:32.110 --> 19:34.000
five million, we got fuck you
money.

19:34.220 --> 19:35.220
What?

19:36.100 --> 19:37.220
We're not ignoring the article.

19:39.010 --> 19:40.180
Kraley, we need to
make it go away.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.100
Fair enough.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.110
So we got two problems.

19:45.030 --> 19:47.040
The most profitable one being
the Cartel.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.030
So let's handle that one first.

19:49.110 --> 19:51.030
You two, pay a visit to Tristan.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.230
He sold the intel
about the transport to us.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.050
Find out who else knew about it.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.170
Listen, I know Tristan
pushes

19:57.210 --> 19:59.050
your buttons, but stay focused.

19:59.070 --> 20:00.070
I feel ya.

20:10.220 --> 20:11.220
How'd it go, Pete?

20:13.180 --> 20:14.220
Not good.

20:15.150 --> 20:17.010
Divorce is part of the job.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.070
I got no sympathy on that.

20:19.110 --> 20:20.120
It's not about the divorce
anymore.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.160
It's about my little girl.

20:23.220 --> 20:24.220
Steve.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.160
I lose my visitation if Lourdes
and her

20:27.200 --> 20:29.140
father can convince a judge I'm
unfit.

20:31.060 --> 20:32.060
It'll shake out.

20:34.060 --> 20:36.060
First the FBI, now the Cartel...

20:37.220 --> 20:39.080
We gotta get out of this cycle.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.010
If we get this money,

20:44.030 --> 20:45.200
we gotta use our
share to go legit.

20:45.230 --> 20:47.000
Go legit?

20:48.070 --> 20:49.180
What the fuck would you two do?

20:50.210 --> 20:52.120
The opposite of
whatever you're doing.

20:59.210 --> 21:00.210
Hey.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.130
I need a word.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.080
What about?

21:07.100 --> 21:09.030
My goddaughter's
busting my balls.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.020
How do you feel about her?

21:12.020 --> 21:14.190
She's a bit young for me,
don't ya think?

21:15.010 --> 21:16.040
Don't even go there.

21:17.140 --> 21:19.160
Honestly I don't know
anything about her.

21:22.050 --> 21:24.110
Before he ate a bullet,
her dad rode with you.

21:25.130 --> 21:26.160
How much more you need to know?

21:31.180 --> 21:32.180
It's not gonna happen.

21:33.140 --> 21:34.210
She's not her old man.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.190
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
What do you guys want?

21:44.220 --> 21:46.190
- To talk.
- Talk about what?

21:46.210 --> 21:49.180
Somebody took Ignacio from us,
after we took him from you.

21:50.170 --> 21:53.010
Now, how the hell do you think
that happened, huh?

21:53.030 --> 21:54.030
You had him.

21:54.210 --> 21:56.220
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, man! Don't touch my leg!

21:57.200 --> 22:00.020
You do that again I'm gonna yell
for staff to throw you out.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.110
He's gonna yell for staff
to throw me out this hospital.

22:03.180 --> 22:04.200
Since the two of you have
history,

22:05.000 --> 22:06.010
why don't you wait outside.

22:06.030 --> 22:07.030
Yeah, go outside.

22:07.190 --> 22:08.170
That way if he starts to get
loud,

22:08.220 --> 22:10.010
you can just explain to the
staff

22:10.030 --> 22:11.080
that we're doing
physical therapy.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.100
What?

22:27.140 --> 22:29.060
There. Thank you.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.100
Hey.

22:37.010 --> 22:38.180
Remember me? From the barbecue?

22:39.230 --> 22:41.060
Cole, right?

22:41.190 --> 22:42.190
Yeah.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.170
Your dad ain't around here,
is he?

22:45.080 --> 22:46.220
Why? You scared?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.090
Hell yeah, I'm scared of him.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.010
But I'd like to take you
to dinner sometime.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.160
Why?

22:59.230 --> 23:01.040
Because I want to get
to know you.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.030
I only sold that info
to you guys.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.220
Then you must've been running
your mouth

23:10.020 --> 23:11.010
in front of the wrong people.

23:11.030 --> 23:12.030
I didn't.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.000
All right!
But I'm not the only one

23:13.050 --> 23:13.230
who knew that was going down.

23:14.010 --> 23:15.010
Who else then?

23:16.190 --> 23:19.170
Supervisor, all the guards
on that detail. Everybody.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.220
Did they sell it to someone?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
No.

23:23.220 --> 23:25.130
No!

23:26.040 --> 23:28.070
My sergeant mentioned it
to an old partner of his.

23:28.090 --> 23:29.160
This old partner of your
sergeant,

23:29.200 --> 23:30.130
he have a name?

23:32.070 --> 23:33.070
Eli.

23:34.110 --> 23:35.210
I'm gonna need more than that.

23:35.230 --> 23:38.120
Look, I can't, all right?
I don't want to start a turf

23:38.160 --> 23:38.220
war.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.060
He's in a club?

23:45.230 --> 23:47.220
Yes, all right? He's a Horseman.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.140
Horsemen are Port police?
Why are they interested in our

23:51.180 --> 23:51.230
guy?

23:52.050 --> 23:54.050
I don't know, bitch.
Why don't you ask them.

23:55.130 --> 23:57.140
Why do people keep
calling me that?

24:14.190 --> 24:16.000
Don't embarrass me on this.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.110
I'm under pressure here.

24:17.220 --> 24:18.230
You get that, right?

24:19.120 --> 24:20.120
No.

24:21.030 --> 24:22.050
Of course you don't.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.230
What's he doing here?

24:29.230 --> 24:31.000
Mind your business.

24:37.130 --> 24:39.150
I hear you've dealt
with the Horsemen before?

24:40.030 --> 24:41.050
Tell me about it.

24:43.010 --> 24:44.060
There's not much to tell.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.210
Neckbone wanted the ports
to move a little weight,

24:46.230 --> 24:48.220
Winters contracted a deal
with the Horsemen, splitting the

24:49.020 --> 24:49.070
tax.

24:49.090 --> 24:50.180
Neckbone's gone,

24:50.200 --> 24:52.080
so who's dealing with
the Horsemen now?

24:56.100 --> 24:57.130
I want the corners back.

24:58.110 --> 25:00.090
-Jesus.
-No.

25:00.190 --> 25:02.010
We have nothing to talk about.

25:03.090 --> 25:04.080
Because whatever you got going
with

25:04.120 --> 25:05.110
the Colombians is gonna pay.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.220
He asked why you wanted to talk.
I didn't say anything other than

25:11.020 --> 25:11.080
that.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.140
She's telling the truth.

25:12.230 --> 25:14.150
I don't know what you got
going on with them, I don't

25:14.190 --> 25:15.000
care.

25:15.170 --> 25:17.000
All I care about is telling my
people

25:17.040 --> 25:18.010
we're earning again.

25:20.110 --> 25:22.090
Look, we gave you those corners
because of what Winters did.

25:22.110 --> 25:23.180
That debt is now paid.

25:25.030 --> 25:26.100
It's time to give them back.

25:33.100 --> 25:36.050
OK. You got the spots back.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.130
Mexican cartel took
Neckbone's place.

25:43.010 --> 25:44.030
The Horsemen shut us out of the
deal

25:44.070 --> 25:45.010
as soon as they did.

25:52.150 --> 25:54.080
We'll give Carmen the
information

25:54.120 --> 25:56.150
and if they get the old man
back...

25:58.070 --> 26:00.030
...we should get a percentage
of the reward as well as the

26:00.070 --> 26:00.120
gun.

26:00.140 --> 26:03.110
They're not gonna go for that.
And I don't want a percentage,

26:03.130 --> 26:05.120
I just want my five
million bucks.

26:06.050 --> 26:08.190
Kraley, for once in your life
think about someone other than

26:08.230 --> 26:09.110
yourself.

26:10.050 --> 26:11.070
Someone else?

26:12.120 --> 26:16.010
Last I checked our fingerprints
aren't on the gun. Just yours.

26:16.150 --> 26:19.150
So the way I see it,
it's you just thinking about

26:19.190 --> 26:20.110
yourself.

26:40.030 --> 26:41.180
My brother, Ricardo, was
contacted

26:41.220 --> 26:43.170
by the Mexicans a few hours ago.

26:45.010 --> 26:46.090
It's about turf.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.190
They want our product
out of the city.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.060
So give them what they want
and get your old man back.

26:55.100 --> 26:58.190
My brother would start a war
before he did anything like

26:58.230 --> 26:59.090
that.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.000
I need you and the Ravens.

27:07.140 --> 27:09.150
We're not interested
in getting between you,

27:09.170 --> 27:12.090
your brother, and the Mexicans.
That's a no-win situation for

27:12.130 --> 27:12.180
us.

27:13.170 --> 27:15.130
You and I have a lot in common.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.080
We're both trying
to move in better directions,

27:19.100 --> 27:22.180
but at the end of the day
we're just at the mercy of other

27:22.220 --> 27:23.100
people.

27:24.130 --> 27:28.050
And because of it,
there's a new deal in place.

27:31.020 --> 27:32.030
What's that supposed to mean?

27:32.170 --> 27:35.140
When you called
and said that we needed to meet,

27:35.160 --> 27:38.180
I was curious
as to why Kraley wasn't joining

27:38.220 --> 27:39.060
us.

27:40.050 --> 27:41.050
So I called him.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.110
-Son of a bitch.
-In his defense, he did make new

27:46.150 --> 27:47.040
demands.

27:48.170 --> 27:49.170
Like what?

27:50.090 --> 27:51.140
An extra million.

27:53.100 --> 27:54.140
And a sign of goodwill.

28:03.150 --> 28:05.110
If you give me that,
why should I help you?

28:06.130 --> 28:08.070
For the money,

28:08.090 --> 28:10.200
which Kraley says
you need to get out of this

28:11.000 --> 28:11.090
life.

28:37.210 --> 28:39.210
-License and registration.
-What'd I do?

28:40.150 --> 28:41.230
I have the right to know.

28:42.090 --> 28:43.160
You absolutely do.
And that's why

28:43.200 --> 28:45.130
I'm gonna put it in writing for
you.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.200
Now give me your license
and registration.

28:48.100 --> 28:50.140
This is why people hate cops.

28:53.070 --> 28:54.110
The feeling's mutual.

29:00.210 --> 29:01.210
Anything?

29:01.230 --> 29:03.190
Yeah.
You're not gonna like it.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.120
We all got needs.

29:13.110 --> 29:14.110
You want your daughter back,

29:14.130 --> 29:16.060
that six million
would get you the best lawyer in

29:16.100 --> 29:16.160
town.

29:16.180 --> 29:19.060
-I say we chance it.
-They're not hood rats we're

29:19.100 --> 29:20.050
dealing with.

29:20.070 --> 29:21.210
They're a lot more
dangerous than that.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.170
Back me up on this.

29:25.110 --> 29:26.110
He's right.

29:27.150 --> 29:29.050
I'm gonna need that money,
Steve.

29:36.050 --> 29:37.050
Kraley?

29:42.110 --> 29:43.140
What's up? I'm busy.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.130
Carl told me you said no.

29:46.110 --> 29:47.110
Yeah, I did.

29:48.170 --> 29:49.200
Can you just hear me out?

29:49.220 --> 29:51.040
-Look, I ain't got time for this
shit.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.090
-Look, look, look, I lead

29:52.110 --> 29:54.040
in arrest stats over
at the 14th.

29:54.180 --> 29:56.120
If I stayed, I would've
been treated well,

29:56.140 --> 29:57.190
but I didn't.

29:58.230 --> 30:01.050
Because ever since I was a kid
I looked up to my dad.

30:02.020 --> 30:03.110
I need to know that he's looking
down

30:03.150 --> 30:04.130
on me and he's proud.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.000
Transferring here and becoming
a Raven would've been what he

30:08.040 --> 30:08.100
wanted.

30:08.120 --> 30:10.080
Bullshit. I knew your old man.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.160
He would've wanted his kid
far away from this kind of shit.

30:13.180 --> 30:15.060
It's not just about me.

30:16.070 --> 30:17.200
Now that he's gone I'm
responsible

30:18.010 --> 30:19.140
for raising my little sister.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.120
You can't do that on a
cop's salary.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.100
I need to earn.

30:27.120 --> 30:29.230
Your problem, not ours.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.220
- What was that all about?
- Says she wants to

30:34.020 --> 30:34.080
earn.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.040
So, let her. Her old man
was a stand-up guy.

30:37.060 --> 30:38.210
Yeah. But we don't know her
like we knew him.

30:40.200 --> 30:43.140
-You don't see the similarity?
-What are you talking about,

30:43.180 --> 30:44.000
man?

30:45.060 --> 30:47.180
The only reason you got ink

30:47.200 --> 30:50.010
is 'cause of your dad
and your brother.

31:15.110 --> 31:18.050
You know, the polite thing
would've been to call before

31:18.090 --> 31:19.020
stopping by.

31:19.090 --> 31:20.220
We know you're running
protection

31:21.020 --> 31:22.090
for the Mexican Cartel.

31:23.070 --> 31:24.110
So what about it?

31:25.020 --> 31:27.000
We earn however we want.

31:27.020 --> 31:29.160
Last I checked I don't need
any other club's approval on

31:29.200 --> 31:30.040
that.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.080
What, you looking for a date?

31:36.190 --> 31:38.110
How'd you hurt your arm, man?

31:38.130 --> 31:40.130
He scratched himself
on a rusty nail.

31:41.010 --> 31:42.210
-Place is full of them.
-Hey, cut the bullshit, Eli.

31:42.230 --> 31:44.150
We want to end this
before it gets any worse.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.110
Listen.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.140
How much is it going to take for
you

31:50.180 --> 31:52.050
to walk away from the Mexicans?

31:54.180 --> 31:57.160
We earn because once
we take a job,

31:57.180 --> 31:59.090
we finish it.

31:59.150 --> 32:01.100
So there's nothing you or the
Colombians

32:01.140 --> 32:03.050
can offer that will change that.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.200
We'll see about that.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Cole!

32:40.060 --> 32:41.060
What do you--

32:46.210 --> 32:49.040
I didn't go to that reporter,
he came to me.

32:51.180 --> 32:53.060
And that makes it OK?

32:53.220 --> 32:55.130
Do you know what you've done?

32:56.060 --> 32:58.110
I answered some questions.

33:00.020 --> 33:02.180
You saw a chance to stick
a knife in my ribs and you

33:02.220 --> 33:03.170
jumped at it.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.180
Has there ever been
a day in your miserable life

33:06.200 --> 33:08.060
you gave a shit about me?

33:08.100 --> 33:10.070
You had three squares
and a roof over your head,

33:10.110 --> 33:11.000
didn't you?

33:11.020 --> 33:12.130
You ever give a shit what I went
through

33:12.170 --> 33:13.120
to put them there?

33:13.150 --> 33:16.120
-You were my mother.
That was your job.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.040
-Oh, I did my job.

33:19.190 --> 33:21.050
Never a thank-you, never an
ounce

33:21.090 --> 33:22.150
of appreciation from you.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.230
Appreciate what?

33:26.090 --> 33:28.020
You treated me like I was dog
shit

33:28.070 --> 33:29.060
under your shoe.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.200
You wouldn't even look at me!

33:35.100 --> 33:36.100
Just like that.

33:44.210 --> 33:47.060
You hated me from the
day I was born.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.120
Turn away.

34:18.210 --> 34:20.160
Just kick me down and turn away.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.080
That is your best trick.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.210
Every time I looked at you--

34:33.090 --> 34:36.140
Every time I look at you,
you wanna know what I see?

34:38.180 --> 34:39.180
I see him.

34:41.020 --> 34:42.160
Your so-called father.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.170
Coming at me.

34:46.190 --> 34:47.220
Holding me down.

34:48.160 --> 34:50.170
I begged him to stop,
but he just...

34:51.000 --> 34:54.160
pulled my legs apart
and rammed himself inside me.

34:55.030 --> 34:56.130
He didn't give a shit.

34:57.180 --> 34:58.180
Got what he wanted.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.180
And I got you.

35:21.210 --> 35:24.220
Dispatch, it's code-four re:
unit 33 Adam.

35:25.090 --> 35:26.210
She's out on a citizen flag
down.

35:27.010 --> 35:28.150
You can cancel the grid search.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.200
Copy that.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.100
Amber?

35:34.210 --> 35:36.130
-Hey.
-Hi.

35:37.210 --> 35:38.210
Here's the thing.

35:39.060 --> 35:41.180
The worst date I ever went on
was with a doctor

35:41.200 --> 35:43.060
and the second worst was a cop
and

35:43.100 --> 35:44.230
the third worst was another cop

35:45.010 --> 35:46.120
and the problem was the same
with all of them.

35:46.140 --> 35:49.060
They had no interest in anything
but getting me into bed--

35:49.080 --> 35:51.130
and I decided I'd never go out
with

35:51.170 --> 35:53.090
another doctor or cop--

35:53.140 --> 35:55.190
and that's me right now
and that's who you'd be taking

35:55.230 --> 35:56.110
to dinner.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.150
I'm interested, yeah, but...

35:59.070 --> 36:00.180
I'm not that guy, all right?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.080
A connection either
happens or it doesn't.

36:04.010 --> 36:05.080
I'm not gonna try to force it.

36:05.110 --> 36:06.150
I'm gonna call you back.

36:06.170 --> 36:09.120
How about we meet
tonight for a drink?

36:09.190 --> 36:11.190
At the wine bar on Third.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.000
11:00 p.m.

36:14.020 --> 36:15.030
OK?

36:15.100 --> 36:16.170
I'll be there.

36:18.020 --> 36:19.090
I'd like that.

36:22.140 --> 36:23.200
Hey.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.200
You didn't kill her, did you?

36:26.220 --> 36:28.190
No.

36:28.210 --> 36:30.030
Kraley needs us to meet him.

36:31.020 --> 36:32.020
About what?

36:32.160 --> 36:33.180
He didn't say.

36:34.230 --> 36:36.160
Yeah.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.200
Shit!

36:54.180 --> 36:56.170
Uh-uh, you're coming with us,
asshole.

36:56.190 --> 36:59.160
Turn around, Briggs.
Turn around.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Let's go.

37:05.220 --> 37:06.220
Get in there.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.080
No, stop.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.090
Oh, you're gonna wanna
lose that hand.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.170
He don't like to be touched.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.080
We need to talk about
the Mexicans.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.190
You know,
instead of sending these

37:51.230 --> 37:52.120
assholes...

37:53.170 --> 37:54.180
you could've just asked.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.230
Yeah, but see, that would've put
us

37:57.030 --> 37:58.000
on equal footing.

37:58.060 --> 38:00.080
And I just don't like equality,
man.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.200
Well, I hate to break it to you,

38:02.220 --> 38:04.060
I'm not scared of them.

38:04.080 --> 38:05.230
And I'm damn sure ain't
scared of you.

38:06.070 --> 38:08.080
We'll see.  Venga.

38:08.110 --> 38:09.170
-No, no, no.
-Stay here.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.050
My brother will
handle this part.

38:12.110 --> 38:13.120
He's a cop.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.180
I'm not gonna let you hurt him.

38:16.130 --> 38:19.080
Is he a cop?
Or is he a gang member?

38:19.190 --> 38:22.130
-You can't be both.
-Well, we fuckin' are.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.220
So listen to what the man said.

38:41.090 --> 38:42.090
Your call.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.200
Families are out of bounds.

38:48.110 --> 38:49.180
Not to us.

38:51.020 --> 38:52.020
Relax.

38:52.220 --> 38:55.130
Men will do almost anything
to protect their family.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.110
He'll do what we want.

38:58.230 --> 38:59.230
Vamos.

39:08.070 --> 39:10.180
My father is being held
in building forty at the Port.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.050
He's being watched
by a group of Mexican nationals.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.230
So we don't make things any
messier

39:15.030 --> 39:16.070
than they need to be,

39:16.090 --> 39:17.230
we want you to go and
get him back.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.110
The Mexicans are dangerous.

39:19.130 --> 39:20.220
I'm not worried about the
Mexicans.

39:21.020 --> 39:22.130
I'm worried about the Port cops.

39:23.170 --> 39:26.000
You need to keep your men
off that part of the Port.

39:27.140 --> 39:29.200
We'll need his uniform shirt
and his access card.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.120
OK.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.130
Bring my father back safe.

39:35.190 --> 39:38.030
Once you do, you'll be paid
what you were promised.

39:47.220 --> 39:50.120
Look at this.
This shit doesn't even fit me.

39:50.200 --> 39:54.060
Stay focused. I want us
all going home in one piece.

39:54.080 --> 39:57.090
We will. So long as
Eli called his guys off.

39:57.170 --> 39:59.180
You know he's gonna retaliate
for this shit.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.030
Of course he's gonna.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.220
We'll worry about that
when we have to.

40:03.020 --> 40:04.160
Focus on this.

40:04.180 --> 40:05.230
Shit!

40:06.170 --> 40:07.170
What?

40:08.140 --> 40:10.000
I was supposed to meet someone.

40:10.020 --> 40:11.080
Well, don't
text right now.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.170
That shit will ping off the
nearest

40:12.210 --> 40:14.140
cell tower and pin us to this
location.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.160
He's right.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.140
If this goes south we don't want
them

40:17.180 --> 40:19.150
tracing us back to a cartel
site.

40:37.180 --> 40:39.200
Port Authority left about
20 minutes ago.

40:40.010 --> 40:40.230
-Haven't seen any movement
since.

40:41.030 --> 40:42.050
- What's she doing here?

40:42.070 --> 40:43.140
Kraley's seeing if she can hang.

40:43.180 --> 40:45.170
That's not a very good idea.
I don't even like her.

40:45.230 --> 40:48.000
-I can hear you.
-I know.

40:48.040 --> 40:51.060
Hey, stay on the perimeter
and keep an eye out.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.220
We'll take care of the inside.

40:53.010 --> 40:54.080
By the time they realize we're
not

40:54.120 --> 40:56.060
Port cops, we'll have the drop
on them.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.130
We're in, we're out, no one
pulls

40:57.170 --> 40:59.010
the trigger unless we have to.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.080
-Let's go.
-Copy.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.180
On me. Cover down.

41:21.010 --> 41:22.120
- Show me your hands.
- On the ground!

41:22.140 --> 41:23.220
Don't even
think about it!

41:24.000 --> 41:25.200
Play it smart, dick for brains.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.110
Tell me where your friends are.

41:30.210 --> 41:32.010
Goddamn it!

41:34.080 --> 41:35.170
What are you doing here?

41:42.200 --> 41:45.040
Oh! You motherfucker!

41:48.070 --> 41:49.150
Leave him.
We need to get to my father.

41:50.170 --> 41:51.170
Hammond!

41:51.190 --> 41:53.010
Go that way!

42:00.030 --> 42:01.030
He's hit!

42:15.150 --> 42:17.160
-What the...
-Shit!

42:23.230 --> 42:26.030
-He ain't here.
-Yeah, but it looks like he was.

42:26.050 --> 42:27.140
Look, this place is gonna be
crawling

42:27.180 --> 42:29.050
with uniforms pretty goddamn
soon.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.080
And we ain't gonna be able
to explain this shit--

42:31.100 --> 42:33.010
let alone that I'm dressed
like one of them.

42:33.140 --> 42:35.050
Well, come on, let's go.
Come on.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.200
Don't touch it.

42:54.090 --> 42:55.130
I had it handled!

42:56.060 --> 42:57.060
Did you?

43:03.140 --> 43:04.150
Next time...
