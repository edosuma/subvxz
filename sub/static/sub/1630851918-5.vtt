No, believe me, it could be worse.

14:36.108 --> 14:37.142
You were right, Monika.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.716
I'm worthless and everyone

14:47.853 --> 14:48.754
Susa...

14:49.889 --> 14:50.789
Pippa...

14:52.491 --> 14:53.392
[sniffs]

14:54.393 --> 14:55.361
Elle.

15:00.599 --> 15:01.667
[chuckles, sniffs]

15:01.767 --> 15:02.768
I only have you now.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.410
[breathes deeply]

15:12.544 --> 15:13.545
I am so sorry.

15:17.883 --> 15:18.784
Why?

15:20.653 --> 15:21.654
I want to help you.

15:23.722 --> 15:24.623
[sighs]

15:28.694 --> 15:29.595
I'm scared.

15:31.931 --> 15:32.831
I know.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.479
Let's get up. We're not allowed

15:47.546 --> 15:49.281
[sniffs] Seriously?

15:49.848 --> 15:50.783
Yeah, it's verboten.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.586
So fucking German!

15:55.387 --> 15:58.390
And while we're at it, actually,

15:58.490 --> 16:00.392
but this is an emergency.

16:00.492 --> 16:02.027
I mean, they tossed you out, right?

16:06.598 --> 16:07.833
I'm a worthless piece of shit.

16:09.201 --> 16:10.769
Let's not get carried...

16:10.836 --> 16:12.404
[horn blares]

16:15.507 --> 16:17.076
What the... What are you doing?

16:17.142 --> 16:18.610
You could have died, goddamn it!

16:19.411 --> 16:21.246
[Mat sobs]

16:31.090 --> 16:32.691
I don't know what's happening

16:36.028 --> 16:37.563
That was so dumb.

16:37.629 --> 16:38.597
That was really dumb.

16:39.798 --> 16:40.733
Man!

16:47.773 --> 16:49.308
[bird squawks]

17:15.067 --> 17:16.001
Monika?

17:17.569 --> 17:19.171
[Ophelia] They're sad,

17:19.705 --> 17:22.875
I think I saw F32.2-2009/02.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.010
- [all] Hermann?

17:25.077 --> 17:28.414
Fiona and Ophelia have had

17:28.480 --> 17:31.450
Apparently, only a severe depression

17:31.517 --> 17:33.552
and anything less is

17:33.652 --> 17:35.454
Right, so what is it

17:35.521 --> 17:37.089
I might have seen him...

17:37.156 --> 17:39.625
No, I'm positive I saw him

17:40.692 --> 17:41.593
Monika?

17:45.431 --> 17:46.832
Mat!

17:46.932 --> 17:48.000
Get in, man.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.968
- Astrid gave me a call.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.907
- Hey, what's going on?

17:55.674 --> 17:56.842
No, I haven't.

17:57.476 --> 17:58.877
Hey, can you please

18:03.148 --> 18:04.083
It's okay.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.192
Come in.

18:15.027 --> 18:15.961
Come.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.367
Okay...

18:23.335 --> 18:24.236
Go ahead. Come on.

18:26.672 --> 18:27.773
Uh, okay, have a look.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.410
With this tablet, you control

18:31.477 --> 18:33.545
You can, uh...

18:33.645 --> 18:35.013
You can control the door.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.216
You can do the oven, the fridge.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.851
You can do the heating.

18:38.917 --> 18:42.521
You can do the cameras and you can

18:42.588 --> 18:43.589
Look at this.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.158
Oh, I love this.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.826
You see that? [chuckles]

18:47.926 --> 18:50.929
Although there are some pre-sets,

18:50.996 --> 18:51.930
[beeping]

18:58.837 --> 19:00.405
Um... Hey.

19:02.007 --> 19:04.176
Uh... I need to get to the shop.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.146
But in case there's anything

19:07.246 --> 19:09.348
no matter what, give me a call,

19:17.322 --> 19:18.991
I don't know who I am anymore.

19:22.294 --> 19:25.531
[Hermann] Her case stepped out on to

19:25.597 --> 19:26.598
and she held him back.

19:30.602 --> 19:33.405
Attempted suicide with a moderate

19:33.472 --> 19:34.873
[Anna-Belle] What happened then?

19:37.743 --> 19:39.545
She literally embraced him.

19:39.645 --> 19:40.879
Embraced?

19:41.480 --> 19:42.915
This is a serious accusation.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.285
Are you certain that, uh, she was

19:46.351 --> 19:49.087
- It's easy to confuse the two.

19:52.724 --> 19:56.595
Um, excuse me, I was just at a really

19:56.695 --> 19:58.397
How much longer is this going

19:59.798 --> 20:01.767
- Exactly what I mean.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.412
Yeah, I'm Monika.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.915
I was... a moderate depression.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.587
And I'm... I'm... well, I...

20:21.687 --> 20:24.323
I feel like, um, right now,

20:26.024 --> 20:28.961
They have taken away my access code

20:29.027 --> 20:31.263
my connection to Mat

20:31.863 --> 20:33.632
Were you at least able

20:34.733 --> 20:36.568
- No.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.439
I will, um, operate the osmosis

20:40.505 --> 20:44.209
until the case has been conclusively

20:46.845 --> 20:49.081
But still you were able to

20:55.587 --> 20:57.189
Why are there severe depressions?

20:58.890 --> 21:00.726
I mean, what's the concept?

21:02.527 --> 21:04.997
And suicide, what's the purpose?

21:10.402 --> 21:11.303
I am Bruno.

21:12.471 --> 21:15.807
Controller and a post-traumatic

21:17.276 --> 21:18.510
I'm ashamed of myself

21:18.610 --> 21:21.913
because I have abandoned

21:22.614 --> 21:25.684
Oh, but you... you didn't

21:25.751 --> 21:26.685
Uh...

21:28.587 --> 21:32.891
If it hadn't been so much fun for me,

21:32.958 --> 21:35.360
If I hadn't been so dumb,

21:35.427 --> 21:38.764
- No.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.199
No, right from the start,
