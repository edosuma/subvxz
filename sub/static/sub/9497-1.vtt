(music plays)

02:24.042 --> 02:26.250
(music stops)

02:37.626 --> 02:39.125
- What time is it?

02:39.209 --> 02:42.209
- Um, I'm gonna say,
we got noon right now?

02:42.292 --> 02:44.626
12:30?

02:49.834 --> 02:51.876
- What is this?

02:51.959 --> 02:53.834
- What?
- This.

02:53.918 --> 02:55.459
Why is this like this?

02:55.542 --> 02:57.417
- Uh, I'm not sure.

02:57.501 --> 03:01.334
- Well, you closed
last night, so...

03:01.417 --> 03:04.334
- Yeah, um...
I don't know, who cares?

03:04.417 --> 03:05.751
I'll clean it up.

03:05.834 --> 03:07.334
- I just don't-
I don't know why

03:07.417 --> 03:09.626
you left a big pile of rags right there.

03:09.709 --> 03:12.667
- Uh, I had to close, and yeah,

03:12.751 --> 03:14.959
so there's a pile of rags that I left,

03:15.042 --> 03:16.542
and I'll clean it up
before we open.

03:16.626 --> 03:18.751
How's this a mystery?

03:18.834 --> 03:21.459
- Pete, the place is always
perfect every time you close,

03:21.542 --> 03:23.876
so I thought you must have a reason.

03:23.959 --> 03:27.000
- So, I didn't.
- Okay.

03:27.083 --> 03:30.334
- I must've just gotten tired
last night and I didn't finish.

03:30.417 --> 03:32.918
- Okay, Pete, you know,
I don't really care.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.751
I'm not- it's not like
I'm judging you.

03:35.834 --> 03:39.667
- Well, you are.

03:39.751 --> 03:41.250
- You know, I'm actually
saying it's because

03:41.334 --> 03:44.667
you're so good at your job,
that's why I'm saying-

03:44.751 --> 03:48.000
Well, you know, it's like-
it's like a pyramid of rags,

03:48.083 --> 03:50.542
it's like you decided to put
a pyramid of rags here.

03:50.626 --> 03:52.459
And you're really good
at closing, that's why-

03:52.542 --> 03:54.167
You know, you understand,
that's like a compliment,

03:54.250 --> 03:57.626
I'm saying, you're so good,
why is that like that?

03:57.709 --> 03:59.834
That's all.

03:59.918 --> 04:01.209
- Okay, I would rather you say

04:01.292 --> 04:03.334
that I just fucked up, all right,

04:03.417 --> 04:05.334
and that I didn't do my job well

04:05.417 --> 04:07.542
than to infer that I would
do something like this

04:07.626 --> 04:09.459
that- for a reason.

04:09.542 --> 04:12.334
I don't like what that infers.

04:14.626 --> 04:16.625
- Okay.

04:16.709 --> 04:19.959
Well, uh, you did a shitty job
of closing last night.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.292
- Okay, thank you.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.209
You want coffee?

04:29.292 --> 04:30.792
- Yeah.

04:33.292 --> 04:35.209
Thank you.

04:44.876 --> 04:47.876
Hey, this is good.
Why is this good?

04:47.959 --> 04:50.417
- I ordered some beans
from the computer.

04:50.501 --> 04:51.834
Yeah, I like it.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.375
- What time is it?

05:07.459 --> 05:09.626
- It's like getting close
to 1:00.

05:24.834 --> 05:27.584
- Hey, it's Dad.
Can you please call me back?

05:27.667 --> 05:31.209
Just trying to reach you.
Okay, thanks.

05:38.334 --> 05:39.751
What time are they coming today?

05:39.834 --> 05:41.834
- I don't know,
around 5:00, I think.

05:41.918 --> 05:43.250
- Fuck.
- I know.

05:43.334 --> 05:44.751
(woman)
- Horace?

05:44.834 --> 05:46.959
- Hi.

05:48.834 --> 05:50.751
- Oh.
- Hey.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.751
- I didn't know where you went.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.667
I got out of the shower
and you were just-

05:54.751 --> 05:56.000
You were just gone and-

05:56.083 --> 05:57.959
I was all around the apartment
calling your name,

05:58.042 --> 05:59.792
but you just vanished.

05:59.876 --> 06:02.542
- Well, I was down here,
I was- I was opening up.

06:02.626 --> 06:04.250
- Yeah. Hi Pete, good morning.

06:04.334 --> 06:07.209
- Hi, Rachel, good morning.

06:07.292 --> 06:09.417
- Come here.
- Okay.

06:14.459 --> 06:16.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:22.876 --> 06:23.918
- Okay, bye.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.751
- Okay.
- I will see you later tonight.

06:25.834 --> 06:27.667
- Okay. Bye.

06:27.751 --> 06:29.000
- Should I open you up?

06:29.083 --> 06:30.542
- Yeah, just go ahead
and leave it open,

06:30.626 --> 06:32.751
we're open, so open it.

06:32.834 --> 06:34.042
Thank you.

06:34.125 --> 06:36.834
- Bye.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.834
(door opens)

07:04.501 --> 07:06.709
- Thanks.

07:09.125 --> 07:10.959
- It's 1:00.

07:12.751 --> 07:16.542
(male newscaster)
- This is Headline News Update.

07:20.876 --> 07:22.459
- Hey, man.
Can I get a coffee, black?

07:22.542 --> 07:23.584
(female newscaster)
- Here's our top stories that

07:23.667 --> 07:25.042
we're looking at for today.

07:25.125 --> 07:28.334
Candidates are gearing up
for the nation's first primaries

07:28.417 --> 07:30.417
and the caucus tomorrow night in Iowa.

07:30.501 --> 07:33.751
Donald Trump still leading
the polls ahead of Ted Cruz.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.417
At a rally today in Des Moines,

07:35.501 --> 07:36.792
Trump's supporters
said that he is the man...

07:36.876 --> 07:37.876
(volume lowers)

07:37.959 --> 07:39.626
- Trump, Jesus.
- What?

07:39.709 --> 07:42.334
Wait, why not Trump?

07:42.417 --> 07:45.209
- 'Cause he's a... jerk.

07:45.292 --> 07:47.959
Drops out of the debates,
and I don't know,

07:48.042 --> 07:49.584
I think he'd ruin this country.

07:49.667 --> 07:52.792
- Okay. So?
Why not that?

07:52.876 --> 07:55.584
Like, what's so fucking great
about this country?

07:55.667 --> 07:57.209
Listen, man, if we vote for him,

07:57.292 --> 07:59.125
that just means
we want to go down,

07:59.209 --> 08:01.834
so let us go down.

08:01.918 --> 08:03.125
- Yeah, I guess.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.167
Hi, Marsha.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.417
- Hey, Pete.

08:10.501 --> 08:12.459
- Yeah, listen, nothing lasts
forever, man, you know?

08:12.542 --> 08:14.918
That's just how a democracy
declines, right?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.334
The populace degenerates

08:16.417 --> 08:20.250
until they elect a guy like that
and he just ruins what's left.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.334
I mean, we used to be great.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.167
We used to be-
have a great work force.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.834
We used to be educated.

08:26.918 --> 08:29.542
We used to pretend
to be moral, right?

08:29.626 --> 08:32.542
Now everything's made
in China by fucking babies.

08:32.626 --> 08:33.876
Everybody's stupid on purpose

08:33.958 --> 08:35.542
and nobody gives a shit
about anything

08:35.626 --> 08:38.958
except consumer pleasures,
so why not Trump?

08:39.042 --> 08:40.751
Let's just get
this shit over with.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.208
That should be his slogan.

08:42.292 --> 08:45.125
"Trump: Let's get
this shit over with. "

08:45.209 --> 08:49.000
- Hi, honey, um, I keep going
to voicemail when I call you

08:49.083 --> 08:50.667
and then you keep texting me,

08:50.751 --> 08:52.584
and I really don't
want to text with you,

08:52.667 --> 08:57.792
so can you please not text and-
and pick up the phone, okay?

08:57.876 --> 09:00.375
Thank you.

09:00.459 --> 09:01.459
(phone alert)

09:01.542 --> 09:02.876
Jesus Christ.

09:05.626 --> 09:07.250
(music plays)

09:08.334 --> 09:11.083
- Hey, Nick.

09:13.626 --> 09:16.542
Hey, who do you got
for the Super Bowl?

09:16.626 --> 09:17.751
- I don't know,

09:17.834 --> 09:19.542
I don't have a dog in the fight
this year, you know?

09:19.626 --> 09:21.751
So I guess it comes down to
quarterbacks this year for me.

09:21.834 --> 09:24.709
Kinda old school, versus new.

09:24.792 --> 09:25.834
I like Peyton Manning,

09:25.918 --> 09:27.751
that's what a quarterback
is supposed to look like,

09:27.834 --> 09:29.167
you know, like a-
like a senator

09:29.250 --> 09:31.667
with a busted nose
from the '50s.

09:31.751 --> 09:34.042
Not a- I'm not
a big Cam Newton fan.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.584
- Oh, Jesus.

09:35.667 --> 09:38.626
Cam Newton, that fucking guy
makes me nuts.

09:38.709 --> 09:40.417
I mean, that-

09:40.501 --> 09:43.250
Grinning like a monkey
all the time,

09:43.334 --> 09:45.375
jumping around,
show boating.

09:45.459 --> 09:51.042
I mean, why is there no humility
left in this sport, huh?

09:51.125 --> 09:52.459
- Yeah, but how can you
tell that he's-

09:52.542 --> 09:54.459
that he's grinning with his-
when he has his helmet on?

09:54.542 --> 09:56.542
- Well, you can see it.
- You can't tell he's grinning.

09:56.626 --> 09:58.792
- What the fuck-,
what are you talking about?

09:58.876 --> 10:00.667
You can see the grin
a mile away.

10:00.751 --> 10:02.209
All he does is grin.

10:02.292 --> 10:03.751
- Stop it.
- Oh, shut up.

10:03.834 --> 10:07.250
- You guys are just afraid
of an exuberant black man, that's all it is.

10:07.334 --> 10:09.542
(Nick)
- Oh, got me pegged.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.417
- I don't know,
I like the Super Bowl.

10:16.501 --> 10:18.751
You know, because of all
the cheering and the-

10:18.834 --> 10:19.876
people get excited.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.709
(music stops)

10:38.125 --> 10:42.000
- Leon.
- Thanks, Pete.

10:48.626 --> 10:50.626
- Hello, Marsha,
you need another one?

10:50.709 --> 10:52.334
- Always.

10:54.042 --> 10:56.042
(woman)
- I'm not going if she's there.

10:56.125 --> 10:58.125
I think she's a dumb bitch.

10:58.209 --> 11:00.751
No, I'm at this bar.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.334
I don't know,
just having a drink.

11:02.417 --> 11:03.667
- Turn that off.

11:03.751 --> 11:07.417
You want to make
a telephone call, go over there.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.959
- Sorry, um...

11:10.042 --> 11:12.292
can I have a double Jack?

11:24.834 --> 11:27.334
- Hey, Pete, um...
listen, you know,

11:27.417 --> 11:29.792
my sister's coming later with
her lawyer to hash everything.

11:29.876 --> 11:31.792
- Yeah, I know.

11:31.876 --> 11:34.751
- So I was thinking that maybe
you shouldn't be here.

11:34.834 --> 11:36.125
- Why's that?

11:36.209 --> 11:38.125
- Because I-

11:38.209 --> 11:40.334
sometimes, when there's
a conflict, you can be-

11:40.417 --> 11:41.751
you can be kind of an asshole,

11:41.834 --> 11:44.751
and I just don't want
to deal with it.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.542
Look, I'm not-

11:46.626 --> 11:47.918
I'm not trying to insult you,
I just-

11:48.000 --> 11:49.042
- You're not insulting me.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.501
- Okay, well, there's a lot at stake here.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.716
- Oh, yeah?

11:51.751 --> 11:53.626
- The whole place is at stake, Pete.

11:53.709 --> 11:55.542
- The whole place?
- Yeah.

11:55.626 --> 11:58.167
- Hey, Horace.
- Oh, fuck.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.667
- First of all, fuck you,
you dumb cocksucker.

12:01.751 --> 12:03.584
Maybe you're afraid
of your fucking sister,

12:03.667 --> 12:04.918
but I'm not afraid
of your fucking sister.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
- All right, Pete.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.334
- And I'll tell you what else,
you miserable cunt.

12:08.417 --> 12:09.626
- Jesus Christ, man, all right.

12:09.709 --> 12:12.125
- No, you know what?
I'll be here if I feel like it.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.918
I mean, when did you start
being the one to tell me

12:14.000 --> 12:15.584
where to go and what to do,
what to say?

12:15.667 --> 12:16.751
Jesus Christ, cocksucker.

12:16.834 --> 12:19.417
- All right, all right.
- You know the thing with you, Horace?

12:19.501 --> 12:21.834
You're not a cocksucker,
you're a piss ant.

12:21.918 --> 12:22.959
- All right, do what you want.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.209
- Oh, oh, oh...
- You do what you want.

12:24.292 --> 12:25.792
- Walk away, walk away.
- Yeah, I'm walking away.

12:25.876 --> 12:27.667
- Piss ant.

12:27.751 --> 12:28.792
You know what a piss ant is-

12:28.876 --> 12:31.334
Leon, you know what
a piss ant is?

12:31.417 --> 12:32.834
- I feel like I know.

12:32.918 --> 12:37.000
- A piss ant is an insect
that has no value,

12:37.083 --> 12:39.334
but it smells like piss.

12:39.417 --> 12:41.834
You know, at least a cocksucker
can do something.

12:41.918 --> 12:43.542
Suck cock.

12:43.626 --> 12:46.542
But a piss ant just sits there
in the door jamb,

12:46.626 --> 12:48.250
smelling like piss.

12:48.334 --> 12:51.751
- I was wrong,
I thought it was a kind of car.

12:51.834 --> 12:54.626
- Why'd you do that?

12:54.709 --> 12:56.792
- I was trying
to make things easier.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.792
- Well, it felt like
you made things harder.

12:58.876 --> 13:00.501
I mean, you had to know
it was gonna go that way.

13:00.584 --> 13:01.667
Why'd you do it?

13:01.751 --> 13:04.542
- I didn't know.
- How could you not know?

13:04.626 --> 13:06.125
You walk up to Uncle Pete

13:06.209 --> 13:09.375
and say, "Don't come tonight
because you're an asshole?"

13:09.459 --> 13:12.167
And then he says what?
"Okay, Horace?"

13:12.250 --> 13:15.125
I mean, it feels like you
did that on purpose.

13:15.209 --> 13:16.375
- I- oh, you're saying this

13:16.459 --> 13:17.542
because of what I said
about the rags.

13:17.626 --> 13:19.334
That's why you're giving me
this shit now?

13:19.417 --> 13:22.334
- How did I end up with
a piss ant for a nephew?

13:22.417 --> 13:24.334
I mean, his father, Horace VII,

13:24.417 --> 13:26.751
he wasn't a piss ant,
right, Marsha?

13:26.834 --> 13:28.792
- I never heard him
described that way.

13:28.876 --> 13:32.000
- Oh, but now get his piss ant son
Horace telling me

13:32.083 --> 13:34.792
I gotta get lost because
he's afraid of his sister

13:34.876 --> 13:36.959
coming over here
with her Jew lawyer.

13:37.042 --> 13:39.626
- Um, that's pretty racist.

13:39.709 --> 13:44.125
- Um, racist is what you do,
not what you say.

13:44.209 --> 13:46.459
This place ain't racist.

13:46.542 --> 13:48.542
We served coloreds here
in the '30s.

13:48.626 --> 13:50.751
- Oh, my God.

13:50.834 --> 13:53.876
- Yeah, nobody would serve
boogies in those days.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.042
I got a picture of a nigger
sitting right there

13:56.125 --> 13:59.542
in that stool, in 1930.

13:59.626 --> 14:01.792
You look at that
and call me a racist.

14:01.876 --> 14:04.417
- Ugh, God damn it, Jesus.

14:04.501 --> 14:05.542
- Don't worry,
he'll run himself down.

14:05.626 --> 14:06.667
- Fuck.

14:06.751 --> 14:09.334
- My father, Pete VI,
he used to say,

14:09.417 --> 14:13.209
"If niggers drink beer,
then we're all niggers. "

14:13.292 --> 14:16.209
Racist, I'll give you
fucking racist.

14:17.918 --> 14:19.834
- That guy's a nightmare.

14:19.918 --> 14:22.125
- Don't come in here, then.

14:22.209 --> 14:23.334
- How about I come in here

14:23.417 --> 14:25.375
and he stops being
a gross racist?

14:25.459 --> 14:27.375
Why is that not an option?

14:27.459 --> 14:31.834
- What I would love
is if you were to shut up.

14:31.918 --> 14:33.918
- Oh, my God.

14:35.626 --> 14:38.125
- Hi, it's Dad, leaving you
another message.

14:38.209 --> 14:39.626
Please don't text me.

14:39.709 --> 14:41.918
I am not gonna respond
to your texts, okay?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.334
So please call me on the phone.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.584
I don't want to communicate
with you that way, please.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.292
Thank you.

14:48.459 --> 14:50.250
- Whoa!

14:50.334 --> 14:51.751
- What was that?
What happened.

14:51.834 --> 14:54.834
- Oh, uh, nothing, nothing,
I'm sorry.

14:54.918 --> 14:59.334
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just...

14:59.417 --> 15:01.125
- What does it mean that
you're an assistant D.A.?

15:01.209 --> 15:04.209
I never really knew
what that meant.

15:04.292 --> 15:07.667
- Well, the district attorney,
Ken Thompson, he runs the office

15:07.751 --> 15:09.626
and he directs
what kinds of cases

15:09.709 --> 15:11.667
and what cases
we bring to court,

15:11.751 --> 15:13.959
and assistant district attorneys
like myself

15:14.042 --> 15:16.375
bring the cases to court.

15:16.459 --> 15:18.417
- How many assistant D.A.s are there?

15:18.501 --> 15:20.584
- In Brooklyn, about 800.

15:20.667 --> 15:23.167
- Oh, that's weird.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.417
- Why is that weird?

15:24.501 --> 15:28.042
- I don't know, that's weird,
like, it seems like a lot?

15:28.125 --> 15:29.542
I thought it was
an impressive thing,

15:29.626 --> 15:32.125
like, you're the D.A.'s assistant,

15:32.209 --> 15:35.542
but there's a bunch of you
all doing the same thing.

15:35.626 --> 15:38.167
Hundreds of you.
It's just not as-

15:38.250 --> 15:41.167
- Yeah, it's not impressive,
I didn't say it was.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.250
- I know, I'm just saying,

15:42.334 --> 15:45.125
I thought it sounded
like a big shot job.

15:45.209 --> 15:46.417
- No, I didn't say
it was a big shot job,

15:46.501 --> 15:49.542
I mean, you asked what I do,
that's all.

15:49.626 --> 15:52.667
- Yeah, but when you're talking
about your job, you're saying,

15:52.751 --> 15:55.042
"Like, you know,
like, look at me.

15:55.125 --> 15:58.334
"This is what I do,
this is something special,

15:58.417 --> 16:00.751
"like, I'm the D.A.'s assistant.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.792
"You know, like,
I work for the city,

16:02.876 --> 16:04.834
"and I put away bad guys

16:04.918 --> 16:07.125
and it's just, you know,
me and him. "

16:07.209 --> 16:09.751
But there's just, like,
a bunch of you all

16:09.834 --> 16:11.334
doing the same thing.

16:11.417 --> 16:13.250
Have you even ever
met the D.A.?

16:13.334 --> 16:16.417
- Uh, no, I haven't, all right?

16:16.501 --> 16:18.417
It's not impressive,
I didn't say it was.

16:18.501 --> 16:21.542
It's just my job, that's all.

16:21.626 --> 16:24.334
- But you have to figure
that the D.A.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.542
was once an assistant D.A., right?

16:26.626 --> 16:28.000
And he worked his way up,

16:28.083 --> 16:32.334
so you can work your way up
and then someday, right?

16:32.417 --> 16:33.417
- Not really.

16:33.501 --> 16:34.751
- Why not?
Why not really?

16:34.834 --> 16:36.417
- Well, because,
when he was an A.D.A.,

16:36.501 --> 16:37.959
he was probably in his late 20s,

16:38.042 --> 16:40.125
and now he's still
younger than me,

16:40.209 --> 16:41.542
so I'm not going anywhere.

16:41.626 --> 16:44.334
It's just a job,
that's all.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.334
- So how old are you, anyways?

16:46.417 --> 16:48.209
- I'm almost 50.

16:48.292 --> 16:51.083
- So how come you're 50
and you're still doing that?

17:03.292 --> 17:06.459
- Oh, my God.
This is like a total dive bar.

17:06.541 --> 17:08.459
- This place is amazing.

17:08.541 --> 17:10.416
- Where are all these fucking
people coming from?

17:10.501 --> 17:12.791
- Outside, I hope.

17:15.125 --> 17:18.375
- Can I get, um,
two vodka martinis?

17:18.459 --> 17:20.584
- No mixed drinks.
- What?

17:20.666 --> 17:25.041
- No mixed drinks.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.250
Beer, whiskey, gin, vodka.

17:27.334 --> 17:29.959
- Oh, um...

17:31.167 --> 17:32.167
- Hi, Alice.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.459
- Hi, Uncle Pete.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.125
Is my dad around?

17:36.209 --> 17:38.125
- Yeah, he's in the back trying
to get you on the phone.

17:38.209 --> 17:40.626
- I know.
How are you?

17:40.709 --> 17:43.667
- I'm, uh... yeah, good.
How's your mom?

17:43.751 --> 17:45.751
- She's, you know.

17:45.834 --> 17:49.542
- Hey, I found some
old pictures of you

17:49.626 --> 17:51.125
that I took when
you were a baby.

17:51.209 --> 17:53.375
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

17:53.459 --> 17:55.042
I was just cleaning up my room

17:55.125 --> 17:56.751
and there's a lot
of old stuff in there

17:56.834 --> 18:00.334
and I found these
old pictures of me

18:00.417 --> 18:01.459
when I was, like, ten,

18:01.542 --> 18:04.334
and of you when
you were a baby and-

18:04.417 --> 18:06.417
and some old black & white photos from,

18:06.501 --> 18:09.250
I don't know, way back when,
that somebody took in the family.

18:09.334 --> 18:11.042
And there's just-

18:11.125 --> 18:13.209
there's just so much old stuff
in there, you know?

18:13.292 --> 18:15.751
- Nice.
You doing okay?

18:15.834 --> 18:18.626
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm great, yeah.

18:18.709 --> 18:19.792
So nice to see you.

18:19.876 --> 18:21.167
Yeah, we never see you anymore.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.375
You gonna- you gonna come by
for Easter?

18:23.459 --> 18:25.459
- Um, I don't know.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.125
Hadn't really
thought about it, so.

18:27.209 --> 18:29.417
- Oh, all right,
well, uh...

18:29.501 --> 18:30.542
it's nice to see you

18:30.626 --> 18:32.167
and your dad's over there
in the phone zone.

18:32.250 --> 18:34.751
- Okay, thanks, Pete.

18:40.501 --> 18:43.042
- Shit!

18:43.125 --> 18:45.792
- Hi, Marsha.

18:45.876 --> 18:47.918
- Is that Alice?
- Yeah, hi.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.792
- Oh. Are you here
to see your daddy?

18:50.876 --> 18:52.292
- Yep.

18:54.209 --> 18:55.209
- Kiss.

18:55.292 --> 18:58.334
- Oh, um...
no, thank you.

18:58.417 --> 19:00.584
- Oh, you don't want to kiss
your grandma?

19:00.667 --> 19:02.584
- Well, you're not my grandma.

19:02.667 --> 19:06.584
You were my dad's dad's
last girlfriend, so...

19:06.667 --> 19:08.459
- Well, that never
stopped you before.

19:08.542 --> 19:11.250
I mean, you always
used to kiss me.

19:11.334 --> 19:12.959
- Yeah, I think that was before

19:13.042 --> 19:16.667
I figured out that
I don't have to, so.

19:16.751 --> 19:19.626
I never-
I never really liked it.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.959
(whispers)
- Wow. Huh?

19:22.042 --> 19:25.125
That's really mean.
That's really mean, Alice.

19:25.209 --> 19:26.959
I didn't think
you could be mean.

19:27.042 --> 19:29.417
- Sorry, Marsha,
I'm not trying to be mean.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.334
- Well...

19:32.417 --> 19:34.250
You should try it sometime.

19:34.334 --> 19:35.876
You have an aptitude.

19:39.542 --> 19:41.125
- Dad.

19:41.209 --> 19:42.834
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

19:42.918 --> 19:45.334
I was just close by
so I just came over.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.209
- Well... I just didn't-

19:47.292 --> 19:49.209
I just didn't want to text with you,
I wanted to talk on the phone.

19:49.292 --> 19:52.667
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

19:52.751 --> 19:54.959
Well, I'm here in person,
so it's better, right?

19:55.042 --> 19:57.042
- It's just, you could have called me,
it would have been okay for-

19:57.125 --> 19:58.334
- What do you want me to do, Dad?

19:58.417 --> 19:59.834
You want me to step outside
and call you?

19:59.918 --> 20:01.125
Is that more in
your comfort zone?

20:01.209 --> 20:02.417
- No, it's okay.
- Okay.

20:02.501 --> 20:06.918
- I'm sorry.
Um... hey.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.417
- Hi.
- You want to sit down?

20:08.501 --> 20:10.334
- Sure.

20:14.083 --> 20:16.125
- Is Pete okay?

20:16.209 --> 20:17.334
- Yeah, yeah, why?

20:17.417 --> 20:20.959
- I don't know, just-
he seems a little...

20:21.042 --> 20:23.501
- Yeah, he's okay,
he's all right.

20:27.209 --> 20:28.959
- Dad.

20:29.042 --> 20:31.125
- Hey, so, look, I just-

20:31.209 --> 20:33.959
I've just been trying
to reach you because,

20:34.042 --> 20:35.125
I don't know, I feel like you're mad at me.

20:35.209 --> 20:36.876
- What?
- Yeah, I feel like-

20:36.959 --> 20:38.292
Yeah, I just- I get this feeling like-

20:38.375 --> 20:39.918
like, we didn't have a fight
or anything, but something-

20:40.000 --> 20:42.334
It just feels like something
happened that you're-

20:42.417 --> 20:43.542
Like, did I-
is there something that I-

20:43.626 --> 20:45.584
- No, it's-
- I'm sorry, I'm-

20:45.667 --> 20:47.959
I just, I- I feel
a bad feeling between us.

20:48.042 --> 20:49.542
- Yeah, I- I just-

20:49.626 --> 20:51.250
Do you want to get
into this right now?

20:51.334 --> 20:52.876
- I'm just trying-
I'm just saying that I-

20:52.959 --> 20:54.751
I'm getting a feeling like
something's wrong,

20:54.834 --> 20:57.751
and so I'm coming out
and saying something.

20:57.834 --> 20:59.375
Isn't that-
is that a bad thing?

20:59.459 --> 21:02.876
- Yeah, yeah, it is,
it's kinda shitty, Dad.

21:02.959 --> 21:04.250
- Whoa.
- "Whoa" what?

21:04.334 --> 21:06.209
You asked the question,
do you want to know the answer?

21:06.292 --> 21:10.751
- What did I do?
- Oh, my... fucking God.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.417
- What?

21:12.501 --> 21:13.542
- You know-
- Honey, I don't-

21:13.626 --> 21:16.834
- No, it's like, you are not aware
of anything, you know?

21:16.918 --> 21:18.334
You, like, look at a person's face,

21:18.417 --> 21:19.876
and if they're smiling,
you're fine,

21:19.959 --> 21:22.334
and if they're not,
then you're sad.

21:22.417 --> 21:23.542
- It- isn't that normal?

21:23.626 --> 21:26.876
- Yeah, for a five-year-old,
but you're 50, you know?

21:26.959 --> 21:31.334
And there are reasons
why I need some boundaries.

21:31.417 --> 21:32.959
- I- Why?
I don't understand.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.751
- I don't-
- Okay.

21:34.834 --> 21:36.667
- Nothing happened.
Did something happen?

21:36.751 --> 21:41.125
- Okay. There's this tortoise
and a frog.

21:41.209 --> 21:43.751
- Is this like a joke or a story?

21:43.834 --> 21:46.834
- So, there's this tortoise
and a frog

21:46.918 --> 21:49.626
and they live together
in kind of, like-

21:49.709 --> 21:51.792
like a swamp, you know?

21:51.876 --> 21:55.626
And one day, the frog eats
the tortoise's eggs.

21:55.709 --> 21:57.250
- He eats his eggs?
- Her eggs.

21:57.334 --> 21:58.834
- What does-

21:58.918 --> 22:01.751
So she cooks some eggs
and then he made her breakfast.

22:01.834 --> 22:03.667
- The tortoise laid eggs,
the tortoise didn't-

22:03.751 --> 22:05.334
how would a tortoise cook eggs?

22:05.417 --> 22:06.876
- I don't know, you're talking
about them like they're people,

22:06.959 --> 22:08.417
so I don't understand what
the rules are of this story.

22:08.501 --> 22:11.000
- Okay, so the tortoise laid eggs.

22:11.083 --> 22:13.542
- Okay.
- That's how she has babies.

22:13.626 --> 22:16.000
And you know, the tortoise,
she protects her eggs.

22:16.083 --> 22:17.584
- Yeah.

22:17.667 --> 22:20.417
- And one day,
the frog is hopping by

22:20.501 --> 22:24.417
and it eats the tortoise's eggs.

22:25.709 --> 22:28.292
- Shit.
- Yeah, it's bad.

22:28.375 --> 22:31.751
And then the next day,
the frog is hopping by

22:31.834 --> 22:33.209
and it's her best friend...

22:34.626 --> 22:35.918
and you know, the tortoise

22:36.000 --> 22:37.542
is looking kind of pissed
at the frog.

22:37.626 --> 22:43.501
And the frog says,
"Why are you mad at me?"

22:47.709 --> 22:51.000
- Okay. I get it.

22:51.083 --> 22:52.751
- You know?
- Yeah.

22:52.834 --> 22:58.167
- Like, you are my dad, so I'm-

22:58.250 --> 23:01.959
like, my brother won't even
say your name and I'm trying.

23:02.042 --> 23:03.834
You know, like,
I like to see you,

23:03.918 --> 23:06.959
I like to come around, I like to
have you in my tech cycle.

23:07.042 --> 23:10.834
- Yeah.
- But that's my choice.

23:10.918 --> 23:14.209
And, like, you don't-

23:14.292 --> 23:17.125
you don't make me smile,

23:17.209 --> 23:21.626
because of stuff that
we both know about.

23:21.709 --> 23:23.334
So I don't know what
you want me to say,

23:23.417 --> 23:24.876
and I don't know
what you want me to do.

23:24.959 --> 23:29.501
You want me to just smile
so that you can feel good?

23:29.584 --> 23:30.667
- It wouldn't kill you, would it?

23:30.751 --> 23:32.876
- Yeah, it would, actually,
I don't want to smile.

23:32.959 --> 23:34.209
I'm not gonna smile.

23:34.292 --> 23:36.918
- That's because you're fat.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.542
It's not your fault, Horace.

23:38.626 --> 23:42.876
I mean, she won't smile
because you're unhappy, right?

23:42.959 --> 23:45.959
I mean, you're unhappy
because you're overweight.

23:46.042 --> 23:48.584
- Uh, thank you so much,
Marsha, thanks.

23:48.667 --> 23:49.751
- Yeah, you know, I mean,
it's all right.

23:49.834 --> 23:51.125
It's just-

23:51.209 --> 23:53.584
you should smile for your daddy,
don't blame him.

23:53.667 --> 23:54.918
- Marsha, Marsha, Marsha,
could you-

23:55.000 --> 23:56.209
- You're overweight.
- Marsha, shut up, please.

23:56.292 --> 23:57.626
- Hey, shut up.
- Hey, hey, hey.

23:57.709 --> 23:58.751
Don't talk to her like that.

23:58.834 --> 24:00.584
- If you don't want to be fat-
- She's calling my daughter fat.

24:00.667 --> 24:01.918
- Shut up!
If you don't want to be fat-

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
- Well, look at her.

24:03.083 --> 24:04.667
She's bigger around the middle
than everybody else.

24:04.751 --> 24:08.292
- Both of you, please-
please shut up, both of you.

24:12.709 --> 24:14.250
- Hey, Alice.

24:14.334 --> 24:16.959
You know, your Aunt Reeny
was fatter than you.

24:17.042 --> 24:18.584
She loved life.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.542
- God damn it.
- No, really, remember her?

24:20.626 --> 24:23.792
- Yeah.
- She was a happy fat girl.

24:23.876 --> 24:25.584
I'm just saying,
it's possible.

24:25.667 --> 24:27.375
- Okay. Okay, Pete.

24:27.459 --> 24:28.626
And what about Cassie,

24:28.709 --> 24:29.792
your daughter,
my dad's cousin Cassie?

24:29.876 --> 24:31.042
What about her?

24:32.834 --> 24:34.292
- What is that supposed to mean?

24:36.209 --> 24:37.626
What? You trying to make me feel bad

24:37.709 --> 24:41.584
because my daughter died?

24:41.667 --> 24:43.959
I was trying to be nice to you.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.751
- You should enjoy
being a fat girl,

24:53.834 --> 24:55.751
it's not a bad thing.

24:55.834 --> 24:57.542
- There.
- Thank you.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.459
This has been a very nice visit
and a real joy.

24:59.542 --> 25:00.584
- Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.751
Where- how- how-
how are you doing?

25:02.834 --> 25:03.918
- What?
- I mean, how are you?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.667
That's all I just want to ever
say is how you doing?

25:05.751 --> 25:06.834
Are you okay?
Have you been okay?

25:06.918 --> 25:08.542
- I mean, no, not really.

25:08.626 --> 25:10.584
- You're not? What's going on?
What's wrong?

25:10.667 --> 25:13.542
- I'm losing my apartment.
- Why?

25:13.626 --> 25:17.918
- Because I was paying my rent
to my roommate

25:18.000 --> 25:20.542
and she wasn't
paying the landlord, so...

25:20.626 --> 25:22.167
- What was she doing with the-
with the money?

25:22.250 --> 25:24.042
- Just being a piece of shit.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.667
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

25:25.751 --> 25:28.751
I'm- and I have to start
studying for the bar,

25:28.834 --> 25:30.417
so I'm just- I'm fucked.

25:30.501 --> 25:32.834
- Move in here with me.
- No.

25:32.918 --> 25:34.542
- Why not?
That's a great idea.

25:34.626 --> 25:35.792
I have plenty of room upstairs.

25:35.876 --> 25:36.876
- No.
- I got rooms.

25:36.959 --> 25:38.042
- Dad, I'm not gonna
live with you.

25:38.125 --> 25:39.167
- This is a solution
to the problem.

25:39.250 --> 25:40.334
- I'm saying-
- No.

25:40.417 --> 25:41.542
- I can- I can do that for you.

25:41.626 --> 25:43.250
- No, that's psychotic.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.751
- Why?
- Because.

25:45.834 --> 25:49.000
I'm not gonna live with you
doing your whole thing.

25:49.083 --> 25:52.542
- It's Rachel.
You don't like Rachel?

25:52.626 --> 25:54.167
- I mean...
- You don't like Rachel.

25:54.250 --> 25:57.125
- That's not fair to her
and that's not fair to me.

25:57.209 --> 25:58.501
- I'm just saying,
if Rachel didn't live here,

25:58.584 --> 25:59.626
then you could move in with me.

25:59.709 --> 26:01.167
- Oh, my fucking God, okay.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.250
- Spend time together.
- Jesus. Bye!

26:02.334 --> 26:05.417
Bye, everyone.
Thank you.

26:20.292 --> 26:21.334
(whispers)
- Fuck.

26:21.417 --> 26:22.626
This place is toxic.

26:22.709 --> 26:25.626
She's- she's like-

26:25.709 --> 26:28.918
she's got this wall
between me and her.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.584
I don't know.

26:31.667 --> 26:36.626
- I mean, I don't have kids,
but it seems to be fundamental,

26:36.709 --> 26:39.459
you just need to make an effort.

26:39.542 --> 26:40.876
- What effort am I not making?

26:40.959 --> 26:42.918
I just asked her
to move in with me.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.334
- Well, that's a grand gesture,
but isn't parenting more about,

26:48.417 --> 26:50.125
you know, like,
the everyday things?

26:50.209 --> 26:53.209
Everyday.
Small things, you-

26:53.292 --> 26:56.334
you take her to lunch,
you listen to her.

26:56.417 --> 26:59.209
One day at a time,
you see what grows.

27:01.959 --> 27:05.000
- You know, Pete, you don't have kids,
so maybe- you know?

27:05.083 --> 27:06.125
- All right, well,
I'm just saying.

27:06.209 --> 27:07.834
- You know, maybe don't.

27:12.876 --> 27:14.417
- Horace, Horace.

27:14.501 --> 27:16.000
- What?
- Horace.

27:16.083 --> 27:17.375
- What?

27:18.792 --> 27:20.459
- What?
- Oh, shit.

27:20.542 --> 27:21.959
Nothing, nothing.
It was nothing.

27:22.042 --> 27:24.000
- Nothing?

27:24.083 --> 27:25.959
Pete, what is going on with you?

27:26.042 --> 27:28.751
You're taking your
Probitol, right?

27:28.834 --> 27:31.042
- Well, I ran out.
- You ran out?

27:31.125 --> 27:32.125
What do you mean you ran out?

27:32.209 --> 27:33.417
- They changed my insurance again

27:33.501 --> 27:34.918
and then they were supposed
to send me new cards,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.751
and they didn't, and I fucked up
'cause I didn't call.

27:38.834 --> 27:41.125
And that shit is $100 a pill
without the insurance.

27:41.209 --> 27:43.542
- Yeah.

27:43.626 --> 27:46.000
You're out?
Are you out?

27:46.083 --> 27:48.959
- I got distracted last month

27:49.042 --> 27:52.334
when it happened, and I was
supposed to take care of it

27:52.417 --> 27:53.834
and I didn't
and I- and then I-

27:53.918 --> 27:56.334
Now I'm less cognizant,

27:56.417 --> 27:59.209
you know, but what I'm doing
is I'm taking less pills.

27:59.292 --> 28:00.876
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Just to spread it out.

28:00.959 --> 28:02.209
- Pete, that doesn't work
that way.

28:02.292 --> 28:04.292
- Well, I got-
I got one left.

28:04.375 --> 28:06.834
- That's it?
- Yeah, so I'm just gonna wait.

28:06.918 --> 28:08.584
This is my last 12 hours of sanity.

28:08.667 --> 28:09.792
- Wait for what, Pete?

28:09.876 --> 28:11.000
We have to take you
to the doctor.

28:11.083 --> 28:12.334
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Why?

28:12.417 --> 28:14.000
- They take-
if I go to a doctor,

28:14.083 --> 28:15.375
I'm so full of symptoms,

28:15.459 --> 28:17.792
he's gonna send me right back
to the hospital, all right?

28:17.876 --> 28:22.918
That I don't need, I'm just-

28:23.000 --> 28:25.918
Horace, it's-

28:26.000 --> 28:27.834
I feel like I'm,
you know, dying here.

28:27.918 --> 28:30.209
Like I'm slipping into
the crazy land.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.417
- Well, Pete, we gotta take care of it,
we just have to take care of it.

28:32.501 --> 28:33.626
- No, it's not your problem,
it's my problem.

28:33.709 --> 28:35.167
- It's very much my problem

28:35.250 --> 28:38.250
and it's gonna become more
my problem, too, right?

28:38.334 --> 28:40.584
So give me your shit,
what do you have?

28:40.667 --> 28:42.125
You gotta get your paperwork
and get me involved.

28:42.209 --> 28:44.834
- I have it, I- it's-
this is the-

28:44.918 --> 28:46.334
that's the old insurance company.

28:46.417 --> 28:47.542
- Okay.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.542
- But they sold my policy to someone else
and I don't know who to call.

28:49.626 --> 28:52.209
- I got it, I got it, okay?

28:52.292 --> 28:54.209
- All right.
- Shit.

28:56.501 --> 28:58.375
- What the hell is this?
- Oh, my God.

28:58.459 --> 29:02.042
- This bar is so old,
it's amazing.

29:02.125 --> 29:04.167
- Hey.
- Hi, can we get two Coronas?

29:04.250 --> 29:06.834
- All right, all you people, out, now.

29:06.918 --> 29:08.000
- Whoa, whoa, wait, what are you-
what are you doing?

29:08.083 --> 29:09.542
- There's too many people in here.

29:09.626 --> 29:10.918
There hasn't been
this many people

29:11.000 --> 29:12.876
since the bar opened
100 years ago.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.626
Come on, bar's closing, let's go.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.167
- No, no, no, no, no, you can't
throw out our customers.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.209
- Hey, these aren't our customers,

29:18.292 --> 29:20.667
these people want martinis and Coronas.

29:20.751 --> 29:23.000
- God damn it, Pete,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

29:23.083 --> 29:25.542
- What, what, do you think you can
run this place without me?

29:25.626 --> 29:27.417
- You're not running it!
- Get out!

29:27.501 --> 29:31.125
Get out! Get-
Get out, get out!

29:31.209 --> 29:32.209
- Pete. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Pete!

29:32.292 --> 29:33.334
Get out!

29:33.417 --> 29:34.501
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Hey, Pete!

29:34.584 --> 29:36.000
- Get out!
- What the fuck?

29:36.083 --> 29:38.751
- Hey, take it easy!
There's nobody there!

29:38.834 --> 29:40.626
- Pete.

29:40.709 --> 29:43.542
- Jesus Christ.
- Shit.

29:43.626 --> 29:44.751
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:44.834 --> 29:46.542
- It's okay, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

29:46.626 --> 29:48.000
What kind of a person acts like that?

29:48.083 --> 29:49.167
- He's off his medication.

29:49.250 --> 29:52.125
- Well, put him in a cage
or something for Christ's sake,

29:52.209 --> 29:53.334
we got customers here.

29:53.417 --> 29:56.501
(Kurt)
- Man, that shit was intense.

29:59.918 --> 30:01.417
- What happened?
What did you see?

30:01.501 --> 30:04.584
- It's a- like a snake-headed thing,

30:04.667 --> 30:07.542
it was horrible, big teeth.

30:07.626 --> 30:08.876
(Leon)
- Did you get rid of it?

30:08.959 --> 30:10.876
- Excuse me.

30:10.959 --> 30:13.792
Uh, is this really
Horace & Pete?

30:13.876 --> 30:16.542
- Yeah, this is Horace & Pete's.

30:16.626 --> 30:21.751
- Well, I just can't believe
that this place is still here.

30:21.834 --> 30:25.542
Is it still run by
a Horace and a Pete?

30:25.626 --> 30:27.250
- Yes, I'm Horace, this is Pete.

30:27.334 --> 30:28.959
That's a previous Pete,
Uncle Pete.

30:29.042 --> 30:30.834
- What, you used
to come here or what?

30:30.918 --> 30:34.000
- Yeah, I used to come here
when I was a kid.

30:34.083 --> 30:37.876
My mother would send me here
for a pail of beer for my dad.

30:37.959 --> 30:40.417
- Yeah, we used to sell beer pails
out the back.

30:40.501 --> 30:45.542
- Yeah, and I- I came here
to get my first beer.

30:45.626 --> 30:48.542
And I met my wife here.

30:48.626 --> 30:53.876
She was sitting... in that stool.

30:56.542 --> 31:02.125
Yeah, and we were- we were
married for years,

31:02.209 --> 31:08.125
and I- I was happy.

31:08.209 --> 31:14.125
And then I heard that she was
sleeping with my best friend.

31:14.209 --> 31:17.209
And so I showed up here one night

31:17.292 --> 31:22.167
and she was sitting
in that stool, again,

31:22.250 --> 31:25.626
with my best friend kissing her,

31:25.709 --> 31:30.334
and I just shot them both dead.

31:32.209 --> 31:36.375
That was back in 1961.

31:36.459 --> 31:40.751
I just got out of-
got out of jail today.

31:43.876 --> 31:47.959
(man whimpers)

31:53.542 --> 31:56.250
(sobbing)

31:56.334 --> 31:57.751
- Is that guy really there?

31:57.834 --> 32:00.125
- Yeah, he's there.

32:00.209 --> 32:03.751
- Hey, you want a beer?
You want a beer?

32:03.834 --> 32:05.334
- Yeah.

32:05.417 --> 32:09.042
- What's the last one you had
since 1961?

32:09.125 --> 32:11.083

32:13.459 --> 32:16.000

32:50.125 --> 32:52.459

33:00.125 --> 33:02.834

33:09.751 --> 33:13.167
- They're gonna be here soon,
we should get down there.

33:13.250 --> 33:17.375
- The accountant's already
down there talking to Pete.

33:17.459 --> 33:18.459
- Well, that's not good.

33:18.542 --> 33:20.000
- I know.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.209
- I'm telling you,
we should get down there.

33:21.292 --> 33:23.334
- You're not going anywhere,
I'll take care of it.

33:23.417 --> 33:28.125
- Well, you're gonna need me
down there, Horace.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.667
- What's that?

33:32.751 --> 33:36.125
Yes, yes, please.
Yes, okay.

33:36.209 --> 33:38.584
Uh, so can you-
can you send the new cards?

33:38.667 --> 33:41.125
'Cause that's the whole thing
is that we need the cards.

33:41.209 --> 33:43.000
- You conservatives are trying
to find something

33:43.083 --> 33:46.125
in Hillary's e-mails because you have
nothing real to say about her.

33:46.209 --> 33:47.751
You're incapable of a real debate.

33:47.834 --> 33:48.876
- Yeah, well,
the problem with you liberals,

33:48.959 --> 33:51.209
you think you're the good guys,
you think that gives you a pass

33:51.292 --> 33:53.876
to do random criminal acts, you know?

33:53.959 --> 33:57.000
Ooh, I- I saved an owl,
now I can go kill a baby.

33:57.083 --> 34:00.000
- That seems like-
you must know that's not true.

34:00.083 --> 34:01.417
- It's kind of an interesting thing,

34:01.501 --> 34:04.125
the way you guys define
yourselves and each other.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.167
Liberal, conservative.

34:06.250 --> 34:08.125
How would you define a liberal?

34:08.208 --> 34:10.042
Like, to you,
what is a liberal?

34:10.125 --> 34:14.417
- Just P.C., fucking fake,
animal rights,

34:14.501 --> 34:16.833
and gay agenda, always pushing
the liberal agenda.

34:16.918 --> 34:19.417
They hate Christians
and they hate white men.

34:19.501 --> 34:21.125
You know why?
'Cause they don't think it through.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.876
And they think they're better
than everyone else

34:22.958 --> 34:24.751
and that they should tell
everyone else how to think.

34:24.833 --> 34:25.833
They're just fucking assholes.

34:25.918 --> 34:28.375
- Okay. How would you define
a conservative?

34:28.458 --> 34:32.333
- Uh, just Jesus everything
and they hate gay people

34:32.417 --> 34:34.375
and racist but pretending they're not,

34:34.458 --> 34:36.876
and they're selfish
and they only care about money

34:36.958 --> 34:40.125
and they think everyone has to do
their conservative Christian shit.

34:40.208 --> 34:44.583
- See, the fact that you start out
by seeing each other like that,

34:44.667 --> 34:46.876
I mean, how could you
possibly ever respect each other

34:46.958 --> 34:48.042
or agree on anything?

34:48.125 --> 34:50.333
- Yeah, well,
they do that, I don't.

34:50.417 --> 34:52.167
(scoffs)
- You just said you do.

34:52.250 --> 34:53.833
You just described us
with a string of insults.

34:53.918 --> 34:55.000
- Just like you did.
- Yeah-

34:55.083 --> 34:57.042
- Okay, okay, okay.
This is getting interesting.

34:57.125 --> 35:00.459
Now, you, define conservative.

35:00.542 --> 35:02.459
- Conservative means values.

35:02.542 --> 35:04.125
Having values
and sticking to 'em

35:04.209 --> 35:06.375
and defending what's right
and not just saying

35:06.459 --> 35:09.459
what somebody said is right that year,
you know what I mean?

35:09.542 --> 35:11.417
There's- there's things in this
world that are right and wrong

35:11.501 --> 35:12.584
and always have been.

35:12.667 --> 35:15.626
And you have to respect
where this country came from,

35:15.709 --> 35:17.250
and you have to hold on to that.

35:17.334 --> 35:20.250
And the fact that country
and God and life,

35:20.334 --> 35:21.918
those are all sacred things.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.751
And people should
respect each other,

35:23.834 --> 35:26.459
and government is there
to facilitate, all right?

35:26.542 --> 35:27.876
It's not there
to control people.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.959
And the way you get
the best out of people

35:30.042 --> 35:32.751
is to make room
for their strengths,

35:32.834 --> 35:35.334
not by overcompensating
for their weaknesses.

35:35.417 --> 35:36.959
- Well, that sounds reasonable.

35:37.042 --> 35:39.792
That sounds like something
most people can respect, right?

35:39.876 --> 35:42.125
- Yeah.
- Now, define liberal.

35:42.209 --> 35:46.375
- Just being open to things
outside yourself,

35:46.459 --> 35:49.918
having your eyes open
and thinking about others,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.334
and being aware
that our planet is precious

35:52.417 --> 35:54.125
and we're responsible for that.

35:54.209 --> 35:56.667
And people need to listen
to each other.

35:56.751 --> 36:00.626
And be decent and tolerant
and that a diverse community

36:00.709 --> 36:01.918
is a strong community.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.876
And sometimes the little guy
needs a hand.

36:03.959 --> 36:05.584
And we're a strong enough
country to do that,

36:05.667 --> 36:06.751
and so we should.

36:06.834 --> 36:07.876
- Okay, how's that sound?

36:07.959 --> 36:09.250
- Sometimes, yeah.
Yeah, okay.

36:09.334 --> 36:14.042
- Yeah? So, if you start by taking
his definition of himself

36:14.125 --> 36:15.876
and he starts with
your definition of you,

36:15.959 --> 36:18.125
don't you stand a better chance,

36:18.209 --> 36:21.375
have a better shot at getting
to some sort of consensus?

36:21.459 --> 36:24.542
(scoffs)
- Who said they want that?

36:24.626 --> 36:25.751
- Well, that's another thing.

36:25.834 --> 36:28.000
- They're not trying
to reach an agreement.

36:28.083 --> 36:30.334
This is fucking sports.

36:30.417 --> 36:36.000
- Hillary Clinton is a cunt,
and I'm a liberal.

36:36.083 --> 36:37.751
- (chuckling)

36:37.834 --> 36:40.250
- Look, do you know how lucky
we are to live in this country?

36:40.334 --> 36:42.542
You think this conversation
is happening in a bar

36:42.626 --> 36:43.834
in any other country?

36:43.918 --> 36:45.751
- God, I hope not.

36:45.834 --> 36:47.459
- Give me a fucking break.

36:47.542 --> 36:49.209
This country is not that great.

36:49.292 --> 36:51.542
It's not even
a democracy anymore.

36:51.626 --> 36:55.042
- Then go live in Afghanistan,
you got the fucking beard for it.

36:55.125 --> 36:56.542
- You know what
the sad thing is?

36:56.626 --> 36:58.751
This country has such potential.

36:58.834 --> 37:00.792
It's not a democracy,
you're right.

37:00.876 --> 37:03.000
But it could be, tomorrow.

37:03.083 --> 37:05.667
If the people woke up,
they could change the whole thing.

37:05.751 --> 37:08.375
The whole system's set up
and waiting.

37:08.459 --> 37:11.000
It's just sitting there
like exercise equipment,

37:11.083 --> 37:14.667
waiting to be touched
while your fat ass watches TV.

37:14.751 --> 37:16.417
If everybody woke up tomorrow

37:16.501 --> 37:19.000
and said, "We're not gonna spend
another fucking dollar

37:19.083 --> 37:22.375
"or cast another vote
or fight another bullshit war

37:22.459 --> 37:26.584
until we get our fair share,"
that shit would change tomorrow.

37:26.667 --> 37:30.209
But it fucking won't,
and the framers knew this.

37:30.292 --> 37:32.000
That's the sick part.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.959
They were sitting in their little room
with their buckled shoes.

37:35.042 --> 37:37.125
And one of them,
probably Jefferson,

37:37.209 --> 37:38.250
because he had the clearest head

37:38.334 --> 37:41.459
from blowing all his jizz
on slave faces,

37:41.542 --> 37:43.959
said, "Hey, the way
to control these people

37:44.042 --> 37:45.375
"is not to suppress them.

37:45.459 --> 37:46.876
That doesn't work anymore. "

37:46.959 --> 37:48.250
- That's right,
that's what history shows us.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.000
Look at the French.
Look at Cromwell.

37:50.083 --> 37:53.334
They knew that every time you
give the control to the people,

37:53.417 --> 37:54.918
all of the control,
they don't want it,

37:55.000 --> 37:56.125
they give it right back.

37:56.209 --> 37:58.584
- Because they're fucking sheep.
- Those are Frenchmen.

37:58.667 --> 38:01.876
- The reason the few and the rich
control all the power

38:01.959 --> 38:04.959
is because the many poor
and stupid let them.

38:05.042 --> 38:07.417
They're too afraid to try
to succeed at anything,

38:07.501 --> 38:10.792
they want to dream about
rich people and never be one.

38:10.876 --> 38:11.959
It's pathetic.

38:12.042 --> 38:13.042
And then you sit here

38:13.125 --> 38:15.375
doing your little
"Punch and Judy" puppet show,

38:15.459 --> 38:18.459
as if it matters if you're a liberal
and you're a conservative.

38:18.542 --> 38:20.876
You're both suckers.

38:20.959 --> 38:22.751
- Sheep suckers!

38:22.834 --> 38:24.542
- There you go.
- Sheep suckers!

38:24.626 --> 38:27.167
- Sheep suckers.
- Sheep suckers.

38:27.250 --> 38:29.459
- Oh, she's my favorite.

38:35.292 --> 38:37.834
- Hey, I'm Horace.

38:37.918 --> 38:38.918
Um, you need some information?

38:39.000 --> 38:40.459
- Yeah, actually,
I'm having trouble finding,

38:40.542 --> 38:42.209
really, any information in these books.

38:42.292 --> 38:43.751
- Okay, well,
what do you need to know?

38:43.834 --> 38:46.334
- Okay, well, what do you
pay your employees?

38:46.417 --> 38:48.375
- I mean, we don't have a waitress
or anything, we just have-

38:48.459 --> 38:50.959
You know, he's the bartender.

38:51.042 --> 38:53.959
- Okay, what's his
salary per week?

38:54.042 --> 38:57.125
- I don't know.
I mean, it's whatever he takes.

38:57.209 --> 38:59.250
- Takes?
- Yeah, he just goes-

38:59.334 --> 39:00.959
He takes out of the register
at the end of the day,

39:01.042 --> 39:03.584
he keeps what he needs
and then he takes the rest to the bank.

39:03.667 --> 39:05.876
- Okay. How much did he
take this week?

39:05.959 --> 39:07.667
- I don't know.

39:07.751 --> 39:10.876
- Excuse me.
- Excuse you what?

39:10.959 --> 39:13.334
- I've just been informed
that you help yourself

39:13.417 --> 39:15.876
to the company profits
at your own discretion.

39:15.959 --> 39:18.209
So would you mind telling me
how much you paid yourself this week?

39:18.292 --> 39:21.626
- Yes, I would mind, very much.

39:21.709 --> 39:24.250
- Okay, well, I need to know.

39:24.334 --> 39:25.876
- No, you don't.

39:25.959 --> 39:27.751
- Look, I was sent here
to examine the-

39:27.834 --> 39:30.918
- Yeah, yeah, you were sent here.
I didn't send for you.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.125
You have no right
to come in here

39:32.209 --> 39:33.834
and ask me these
personal questions.

39:33.918 --> 39:35.250
- Except it's not
a personal question.

39:35.334 --> 39:36.751
- Oh, no, it's not?

39:36.834 --> 39:38.876
You're asking me
how much money I have.

39:38.959 --> 39:43.375
How about I ask you if you
like to fuck little boys?

39:43.459 --> 39:45.834
See? See what that feels like?

39:49.209 --> 39:50.959
- Okay.

39:51.042 --> 39:55.167
So your bartender's salary
is undeterminable.

39:55.250 --> 39:56.334
- Yeah, yeah,
I would say that.

39:56.417 --> 39:58.167
- And how do you justify that?

39:58.250 --> 39:59.542
- Well, the lights are on

39:59.626 --> 40:02.250
and the place has been
open for 100 years.

40:02.334 --> 40:03.375
- Got it.

40:03.459 --> 40:06.334
Okay, also, I've noticed
a strange discrepancy

40:06.417 --> 40:08.918
in your inventory
and sales ledger.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.959
You can see here,
it shows that you buy

40:11.042 --> 40:12.834
a case of Johnny Walker Black per month

40:12.918 --> 40:15.125
and that you sell
two cases per month.

40:15.209 --> 40:18.209
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- Okay, and that same thing

40:18.292 --> 40:20.751
holds true of every liquor
that you sell.

40:20.834 --> 40:22.876
Can you explain that?

40:22.959 --> 40:25.417
- Yeah, I can, but-
but I don't want to.

40:25.501 --> 40:27.751
- Why is that?

40:27.834 --> 40:29.751
- 'Cause it's not a good explanation.

40:29.834 --> 40:30.876
- Do you want me
to say it for you?

40:30.959 --> 40:33.542
Because I think we both know
what we're talking about.

40:33.626 --> 40:35.834
- Sure.
- You're watering down the liquor.

40:35.918 --> 40:37.292
- Yeah.
- By 50%.

40:37.375 --> 40:38.417
- Yeah.

40:38.501 --> 40:41.000
- That's indefensible.

40:41.083 --> 40:44.584
- That's why I didn't
want to say it.

40:44.667 --> 40:46.751
- Why would you do that?
- Why?

40:46.834 --> 40:48.584
Because you make twice
the money.

40:48.667 --> 40:49.834
What's wrong with this guy?

40:49.918 --> 40:51.751
- How can you do that
to your customers?

40:51.834 --> 40:55.334
- Do you know what would happen
if we served unwatered whiskey

40:55.417 --> 40:56.417
to these rummies?

40:56.501 --> 40:58.417
Half of them would have been
dead years ago.

40:58.501 --> 41:01.125
These aren't customers.
They're alcoholics.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.626
- Sir, that is a deception.

41:03.709 --> 41:06.042
- Oh.
- That is a terrible deception.

41:06.125 --> 41:08.459
- Oh, all right, look,
everybody listen up.

41:08.542 --> 41:09.542
Get out of the way.

41:09.626 --> 41:11.250
Listen up.

41:11.334 --> 41:12.667
Just want to let you know,

41:12.751 --> 41:17.584
we've been watering down your drinks,
for years, for 100 years.

41:17.667 --> 41:19.417
So when you get a shot,

41:19.501 --> 41:22.334
it's about half booze, half water.

41:22.417 --> 41:24.167
Anybody have
a problem with that?

41:24.250 --> 41:26.667
- I knew it.
- You fuckers.

41:26.751 --> 41:28.542
- This place is so awesome.

41:31.584 --> 41:34.209
- Have a good day now, okay?

41:41.292 --> 41:44.667
Okay, everybody,
listen, we need to close up early.

41:44.751 --> 41:46.167
- Shit!
- Everybody's got to go.

41:46.250 --> 41:47.542
You all gotta go, now.

41:47.626 --> 41:50.584
- Why are they closing?
- See you, Leon.

41:50.667 --> 41:51.751
Have a good one.

41:51.834 --> 41:56.626
- So, um, want to get a six-pack,
go back to my apartment?

41:57.876 --> 42:00.626
- You want me to?

42:00.709 --> 42:02.501
- You want to?

42:04.209 --> 42:05.959
- Marsha, stick around.

42:06.042 --> 42:08.042
- Why should she stick around?

42:08.125 --> 42:11.125
- Because this concerns her.
- Concerns her how?

42:11.209 --> 42:13.959
- Stick around, Marsha.

42:14.042 --> 42:15.125
- Hello, Sylvia.

42:18.042 --> 42:19.417
You're not gonna say anything.

42:19.501 --> 42:23.209
What's, this some kind of game?

42:23.292 --> 42:24.834
- No, I have nothing
to say to you.

42:24.918 --> 42:26.334
- Not even hello?

42:26.417 --> 42:28.918
- No, especially not hello.
- Not hello.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.542
(chuckling)

42:30.626 --> 42:32.626
You're a mess.

42:32.709 --> 42:34.834
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm good.

42:34.918 --> 42:35.959
Are you okay?

42:36.042 --> 42:37.542
- I'm all right.
- Good.

42:37.626 --> 42:39.542
- You doing all right?
- Yeah, you know.

42:39.626 --> 42:40.792
- Yeah.
- Fine, fine.

42:40.876 --> 42:41.918
You taking care of yourself?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.375
- Yeah. Mostly.

42:43.459 --> 42:46.584
- How is Rachel?
She still living with you?

42:46.667 --> 42:48.125
- Yeah.
- Good.

42:48.209 --> 42:49.209
- Still.

42:49.292 --> 42:51.792
- Did you take care of the urinary tract thing
or did you just sort of ride it out?

42:51.876 --> 42:54.209
- Sylvia, yes, it's fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
- All right.

42:55.542 --> 42:56.542
- You doing all right?

42:56.626 --> 42:58.375
- Yeah.
- You all right?

42:58.459 --> 42:59.667
- Yeah, you know.

42:59.751 --> 43:01.918
Kids go back to school
in a couple of weeks,

43:02.000 --> 43:03.876
Franklin's been hanging
around my house all summer

43:03.959 --> 43:05.167
with his loser friends.

43:05.250 --> 43:08.375
I swear to God, I pay
that school 26 grand a year

43:08.459 --> 43:09.834
just to keep him away from me.

43:09.918 --> 43:11.626
- Hey, Pete, come on down.

43:11.709 --> 43:13.375
- No, no, no, no, no,
hey, hey, let him rest,

43:13.459 --> 43:14.751
he can't- just, he needs-

43:14.834 --> 43:16.000
- This is a family meeting.

43:16.083 --> 43:17.876
He's the reigning Pete,
he's got to be present.

43:17.959 --> 43:19.542
- No, this is not
a family meeting,

43:19.626 --> 43:23.334
this is a courtesy meeting
before I bring legal action.

43:23.417 --> 43:25.918
So why is she here?

43:26.000 --> 43:27.125
- She?

43:27.209 --> 43:31.000
- I said, she stays, too.
- Oh, she.

43:31.083 --> 43:32.959
- What, because she was
the last person our dad

43:33.042 --> 43:34.584
was fucking before he died?

43:34.667 --> 43:36.125
That doesn't make
her family, Pete.

43:36.209 --> 43:37.792
- Fucking is how you make family.

43:37.876 --> 43:38.959
(Sylvia)
- Oh, Christ almighty.

43:39.042 --> 43:40.542
- Now, what's this?
This your legal action here?

43:40.626 --> 43:43.209
- Yes, this is Randall.
Randall- Randall is representing me.

43:43.292 --> 43:45.792
- Hello, nice to meet you all.

43:45.876 --> 43:48.250
I hope we can resolve this amicably.

43:50.083 --> 43:52.626
- This is your representation?
This is your lawyer?

43:52.709 --> 43:54.542
- Yes.
- Randall?

43:54.626 --> 43:55.751
Hello, Randall.

43:55.834 --> 43:58.250
- Come on, Pete,
stop with that.

43:58.334 --> 43:59.918
- What? He's a sissy.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.167
- Come on, it's 2016.

44:02.250 --> 44:04.876
- Not for him, it isn't.
Cro-Magnon idiot.

44:04.959 --> 44:05.959
- Don't bother, Sylvia.

44:06.042 --> 44:09.125
- No, his homophobic bullshit
is unacceptable.

44:09.209 --> 44:11.876
- Well, I wouldn't have gotten
very far as a lawyer in New York

44:11.959 --> 44:13.876
if I didn't accept it.

44:13.959 --> 44:19.250
At least I don't have to put up
with it every day like he does.

44:22.542 --> 44:24.626
- Hey, Pete.
- Pete, hi.

44:24.709 --> 44:26.751
- Hi, Sylvia.

44:26.834 --> 44:28.375
- He ran out of Probitol.

44:28.459 --> 44:31.876
- He what? How- how could you
let that happen?

44:31.959 --> 44:33.209
- I didn't let it happen.

44:33.292 --> 44:35.042
- So what the hell's wrong
with you, anyway?

44:35.125 --> 44:37.584
What, you get cuckoo
if you don't have a pill?

44:37.667 --> 44:39.542
- Pete, Pete,
he has a mental condition.

44:39.626 --> 44:42.125
- No, come on, he's just agitated,
that's all.

44:42.209 --> 44:44.334
So what?
You calm down.

44:44.417 --> 44:48.125
You know, you feel something strange
coming on, you just- you calm down.

44:48.209 --> 44:50.000
What the hell do you
need a pill for?

44:50.083 --> 44:52.042
- Listen, I would really
like to get started

44:52.125 --> 44:54.626
because we have
a bit of ground to cover.

44:54.709 --> 44:56.459
From my read of things,

44:56.542 --> 45:00.209
this case covers
a common law issue

45:00.292 --> 45:03.417
regarding Sylvia
and her brothers,

45:03.501 --> 45:05.417
involving this bar,

45:05.501 --> 45:08.125
which they inherited from their
father when he died a year ago.

45:08.209 --> 45:10.626
- That's not what happened,
that's not the way this works.

45:10.709 --> 45:12.542
You know, you have
no business being here.

45:12.626 --> 45:15.626
- Pete, please, don't start with the-
the nonsense about

45:15.709 --> 45:18.584
the Horace & Pete lineage,
this is not "Game of Thrones. "

45:18.667 --> 45:20.959
- Okay, Mister-

45:21.042 --> 45:22.959
- It's Uncle Pete.
- Okay.

45:23.042 --> 45:24.876
If my notes are correct,

45:24.959 --> 45:27.876
you were Horace Sr. 's first cousin?

45:27.959 --> 45:30.000
Which really gives you no role here.

45:30.083 --> 45:32.334
- Hey, screw you, Randall.

45:32.417 --> 45:36.167
He was Horace
and I was Pete

45:36.250 --> 45:39.209
and now he's gone
and that makes me Uncle Pete

45:39.292 --> 45:41.000
and these two now are
Horace and Pete.

45:41.083 --> 45:42.167
- All right,
we're not gonna do this,

45:42.250 --> 45:44.667
okay, 'cause this is old bullshit malarkey.

45:44.751 --> 45:47.751
- This is how it's been done
for 100 years!

45:47.834 --> 45:48.834
100 years!

45:48.918 --> 45:52.375
- Okay, everyone, please
just a minute here.

45:52.459 --> 45:56.209
Let's just get
the facts clear first.

45:56.292 --> 46:00.125
Horace & Pete, this bar,

46:00.209 --> 46:03.250
previously owned
by Horace Wittel,

46:03.334 --> 46:05.959
deceased one year ago today.

46:06.042 --> 46:08.417
- Really?
- Yeah, it's not a coincidence.

46:08.501 --> 46:09.542
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

46:09.626 --> 46:14.834
Mr. Wittel, having left
no will on record,

46:14.918 --> 46:16.876
common law is applied,

46:16.959 --> 46:19.584
leaving care and ownership
to his children,

46:19.667 --> 46:23.334
Horace Wittel VllI
and Sylvia Wittel.

46:23.417 --> 46:24.751
- None of that's true.

46:24.834 --> 46:26.417
- Hey, can we let him finish,
please?

46:26.501 --> 46:29.667
- He didn't leave it to her,
he left it to Horace and Pete.

46:29.751 --> 46:32.751
- Okay, common law says
that he left it

46:32.834 --> 46:35.584
to all of his children
equally, by default,

46:35.667 --> 46:36.959
and that after a year,

46:37.042 --> 46:39.375
because these two have let
the business steadily decline,

46:39.459 --> 46:42.375
I as a partner have
a right to take over control

46:42.459 --> 46:44.250
of the business to dissolve it.

46:44.334 --> 46:47.542
- This bar belongs
to Horace and Pete.

46:47.626 --> 46:49.834
Marsha here gets a cut

46:49.918 --> 46:51.959
when business is good,
I get my cut.

46:52.042 --> 46:53.209
- No, no, not anymore.

46:53.292 --> 46:55.334
- And Sylvia, if you want
a share of this,

46:55.417 --> 46:57.375
then I suggest you
get knocked up,

46:57.459 --> 46:58.751
if any man will have you,

46:58.834 --> 47:02.209
and then give birth to
a son and call him Horace,

47:02.292 --> 47:04.125
because you're not gonna get anything
bringing this fag in here.

47:04.209 --> 47:05.334
(Sylvia)
- Holy shit.

47:05.417 --> 47:06.584
- No offense, Randall.

47:06.667 --> 47:08.834
- Peter-
- No, no, just a minute, Sylvia.

47:08.918 --> 47:10.250
This is what you
brought me here for.

47:10.334 --> 47:11.417
Okay.

47:12.834 --> 47:16.334
So tell me, Peter...

47:17.918 --> 47:21.417
Tell me what you know that I don't.

47:22.959 --> 47:28.667
- Because, like you said,
Horace Vll left no will,

47:28.751 --> 47:32.000
because we don't use wills,
we don't leave wills.

47:32.083 --> 47:33.125
We have traditions.

47:33.209 --> 47:34.751
- Okay, Pete,
none of this means anything.

47:34.834 --> 47:36.000
- No, I want to hear this.

47:37.834 --> 47:40.250
- Go ahead, tell him.
Tell him all the whole thing.

47:41.709 --> 47:43.000
- Horace & Pete's
was opened in 1916-

47:43.083 --> 47:45.000
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

47:45.083 --> 47:48.751
- I'm telling the story.
- Go ahead, tell it.

47:48.834 --> 47:50.334
- Hey, I have a story.

47:50.417 --> 47:52.250
- I'll tell it.

47:52.334 --> 47:54.876
Come over here.
Come here.

47:59.876 --> 48:01.334
Do you drink?

48:01.417 --> 48:03.417
- Sure.

48:07.209 --> 48:09.501
- Take a taste of that.

48:15.542 --> 48:17.751
- Wow, that's wonderful.

48:17.834 --> 48:22.459
- That's because
it's 100 years old.

48:22.542 --> 48:26.042
That, my Miss Randall,

48:26.125 --> 48:28.918
was the first bottle of whiskey
ever purchased for this place.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.584
- I mean, that is the most
incredible whiskey I've ever tasted.

48:32.667 --> 48:34.250
I've never tasted
anything like that.

48:34.334 --> 48:37.250
It's like... drinking time.

48:37.334 --> 48:40.375
- This bottle was bought
by Horace Wittel.

48:40.459 --> 48:43.626
Wittel, Horace Wittel.

48:43.709 --> 48:46.751
And in 1916,
he started this place

48:46.834 --> 48:50.542
and operated it with his brother, Pete.

48:50.626 --> 48:52.209
Now, in the meantime,

48:52.292 --> 48:56.667
Horace had a son named Horace
and Pete had a son named Pete.

48:56.751 --> 48:57.834
And when they died,

48:57.918 --> 49:00.918
those Horace and Pete inherited
the place and they ran it

49:01.000 --> 49:03.626
as the new Horace and Pete.

49:03.709 --> 49:06.375
And it's been like that,
passing down from generation

49:06.459 --> 49:08.667
to generation ever since then.

49:08.751 --> 49:10.834
Always in the family,

49:10.918 --> 49:12.334
always owned by a Horace

49:12.417 --> 49:16.542
and operated in partnership
with a Pete.

49:16.626 --> 49:20.584
Sometimes they were brothers,
sometimes they were cousins.

49:20.667 --> 49:22.876
Me and my cousin Horace
owned this place

49:22.959 --> 49:27.375
until he died a year ago today.

49:27.459 --> 49:29.918
And then it was passed on
to this worthless fuck Horace

49:30.000 --> 49:32.792
and his worthless fuck cousin Pete.

49:32.876 --> 49:34.834
- So-
- What?

49:34.918 --> 49:36.000
- What?

49:36.083 --> 49:38.834
- You said cousin.
- So?

49:38.918 --> 49:40.959
- We're not cousins,
we're brothers.

49:41.042 --> 49:43.334
- No, you're not, stupid.
- No, Pete, our brother Pete.

49:43.417 --> 49:44.751
(Uncle Pete)
- No, he's not.

49:44.834 --> 49:46.792
- What are you talking about?

49:46.876 --> 49:48.542
- Horace wasn't your father.

49:48.626 --> 49:50.459
(Horace)
- Yes, he was.

49:50.542 --> 49:53.417
- No, he was-

49:53.501 --> 49:55.125
He was my kid.

49:56.501 --> 49:57.584
I don't like kids.

49:57.667 --> 50:00.334
So I put him in with Horace's,
that's all.

50:02.334 --> 50:03.876
- Are you fucking serious?

50:03.959 --> 50:06.209
- What? It's not serious.
It's what is.

50:08.751 --> 50:10.459
- Wait a minute.

50:10.542 --> 50:12.751
So who's his mother?

50:13.918 --> 50:15.959
- Never mind that.
That- that's none of your business.

50:16.042 --> 50:17.584
- No, I kinda think it is, Pete.

50:17.667 --> 50:20.792
- Oh, okay, all right,
she had him and she died

50:20.876 --> 50:23.876
and then I have him over
to Horace when Sylvia was two.

50:25.834 --> 50:27.334
- You're not-
you're not kidding.

50:27.417 --> 50:30.792
- This is- this is true?
So you gave up your son?

50:30.876 --> 50:32.250
- I don't like kids.

50:32.334 --> 50:34.459
- And then you married
Aunt Dorothy and had-

50:34.542 --> 50:35.834
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

50:35.918 --> 50:37.209
Look, that's not the story here.

50:37.292 --> 50:39.751
This is the story here,
let me tell the fucking story!

50:39.834 --> 50:40.959
- Dad?

50:41.042 --> 50:44.083
- Oh, don't start that shit now,
I'm not your father.

50:45.334 --> 50:46.375
I'm Uncle Pete.

50:46.459 --> 50:47.667
Just keep things the way they are.

50:47.751 --> 50:49.417
Uncle Pete, that's it.

50:49.501 --> 50:52.876
- Oh, my God, wow.

50:52.959 --> 50:54.375
- Wow.

50:54.459 --> 50:57.334
- This is the best whiskey in the world.

50:57.417 --> 51:00.334
I mean, wow.

51:00.417 --> 51:02.375
- This faggot likes whiskey.

51:02.459 --> 51:06.209
- That's why when mom left
and moved to Manhattan,

51:06.292 --> 51:10.792
she only took you two, not me,
because she's not my mom.

51:10.876 --> 51:12.334
- Yeah, you'll catch on real quick.

51:12.417 --> 51:13.417
- Oh, my God.

51:13.501 --> 51:15.125
- Look, I kept you in the family,
didn't I?

51:15.209 --> 51:16.334
You're Pete.

51:16.417 --> 51:19.042
You're the new Pete
of this new generation.

51:19.125 --> 51:21.542
That means you own this bar
along with Horace

51:21.626 --> 51:23.250
and you can do with it
whatever you want.

51:23.334 --> 51:26.959
- None of this is written down
or documented anywhere.

51:27.042 --> 51:28.876
It has absolutely no basis in law.

51:28.959 --> 51:30.751
It is fucking madness.

51:30.834 --> 51:33.000
This place belongs
to me and Horace,

51:33.083 --> 51:35.375
through basic common law, okay?

51:35.459 --> 51:37.209
- Randall, please?
- That's right.

51:37.292 --> 51:38.584
- Common law.
- Common law.

51:38.667 --> 51:41.125
- Common law.
Okay, now, look, I'm not-

51:41.209 --> 51:43.417
You know, I'm not
an educated guy or anything,

51:43.501 --> 51:45.667
but it seems to me
that common law

51:45.751 --> 51:48.918
is when there's
nothing written down, right?

51:49.000 --> 51:50.834
Like there's no will, right?

51:50.918 --> 51:52.792
And that's when you go

51:52.876 --> 51:57.292
to a generally agreed upon principle of law,
is that- is that right?

51:57.375 --> 51:59.167
- Yeah, pretty close.

51:59.250 --> 52:01.042
- So what about our family law?

52:01.125 --> 52:03.542
What about-
what about our common law?

52:03.626 --> 52:05.125
- What do you mean?

52:05.209 --> 52:10.334
- This family,
this establishment has a tradition,

52:10.417 --> 52:11.667
it has a history,

52:11.751 --> 52:14.918
it has bylaws that have been
followed by the letter

52:15.000 --> 52:18.042
for a 100 years.

52:18.125 --> 52:21.042
You're gonna tell me that if
this goes in front of a judge,

52:21.125 --> 52:23.792
he's not gonna
pay some respect to that?

52:23.876 --> 52:25.375
Here in Brooklyn?

52:25.459 --> 52:28.959
- Well, not-
- No, that is why we are here.

52:29.042 --> 52:31.334
Because common law,
not family law,

52:31.417 --> 52:34.876
common law dictates that
because he fucked the place up,

52:34.959 --> 52:36.584
it gives me the right to sell it.

52:36.667 --> 52:37.876
- Oh, stop it.

52:37.959 --> 52:39.334
You're not gonna
sell this place.

52:39.417 --> 52:41.125
I see you coming a mile away.

52:41.209 --> 52:42.542
- What are you?

52:42.626 --> 52:44.042
- It's always been a woman
in this family

52:44.125 --> 52:45.542
always trying to shut the place down.

52:45.626 --> 52:48.334
You know, the very first
Horace & Petes,

52:48.417 --> 52:51.417
they started this place
just to get away from their wives.

52:51.501 --> 52:52.834
It's always been a female
in the family.

52:52.918 --> 52:55.459
- Oh, my God, Pete,
are you proud of that?

52:55.542 --> 52:59.542
All that misery in this
fucked-up place in our family?

52:59.626 --> 53:02.542
Why are you holding on to that?

53:02.626 --> 53:04.250
Why do you want us
to hold on to that?

53:04.334 --> 53:05.375
Why can't we all-

53:05.459 --> 53:07.209
- We're not gonna
close this place down!

53:07.292 --> 53:10.417
- Pete, Pete, you are
the most unhappy man

53:10.501 --> 53:14.000
I have ever known
in my whole life.

53:14.083 --> 53:15.959
My whole life.

53:16.042 --> 53:19.918
Horace is gone.
Everybody's gone, okay?

53:20.000 --> 53:23.751
Let us sell this place.

53:23.834 --> 53:26.042
Let us get on with our lives.

53:26.125 --> 53:28.542
We will get you nice place
in Florida.

53:28.626 --> 53:30.167
You can get a mail order bride,

53:30.250 --> 53:32.834
you can fuck her mouth
until you're dead.

53:32.918 --> 53:35.667
Our brother can go back
to his accounting job

53:35.751 --> 53:38.334
with real live human beings
and pretend he's one of them.

53:38.417 --> 53:39.459
- A 100 years, Sylvia.

53:39.542 --> 53:43.417
- 100 years of misery is enough,
it's enough, Pete.

53:43.501 --> 53:45.125
Misery is something you get past,

53:45.209 --> 53:48.042
not something you pass on
to your children.

53:48.125 --> 53:49.334
- Boy, if your father could hear you...

53:49.417 --> 53:50.667
- Yeah, my father was a wife-beater

53:50.751 --> 53:53.167
and a fucking brute
and a narcissist.

53:53.250 --> 53:56.959
And thank God
our mother got us out of here.

53:57.042 --> 53:59.459
How many wives have been beaten
in this place, Pete?

53:59.542 --> 54:02.209
This has never
been a good thing.

54:02.292 --> 54:04.751
So you are Pete's father.

54:04.834 --> 54:06.042
Oh, my God.

54:06.125 --> 54:08.918
- Yeah, now I just got that, too.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.459
- Boy, did you fuck things up, Horace.

54:11.542 --> 54:13.667
You see what a mess you made
by not stepping up?

54:13.751 --> 54:16.042
You're supposed to be
the fucking boss.

54:16.125 --> 54:17.834
- I don't- I don't care.

54:17.918 --> 54:21.834
- You should be defending
this place, you, not me, I'm old.

54:21.918 --> 54:24.125
- I don't care.

54:25.125 --> 54:26.959
I'm not the new Horace, okay?

54:27.042 --> 54:30.042
I'm not- I'm not the boss,
I'm not my dad.

54:30.125 --> 54:32.167
- You're a loser.
- Okay, fine.

54:32.250 --> 54:34.792
I'm a loser,
if that's what you want.

54:34.876 --> 54:37.209
And fuck you, by the way,
from before.

54:37.292 --> 54:38.375
- What?

54:38.459 --> 54:40.876
- You said- earlier,
you said fuck you to me,

54:40.959 --> 54:42.584
so fuck you, too.

54:42.667 --> 54:44.250
- Oh, well, fuck you.

54:44.334 --> 54:45.834
(chuckling)
- Fuck you.

54:45.918 --> 54:47.751
- Stop it.
Just stop it!

54:47.834 --> 54:49.375
- Oh, oh, here goes this again.

54:49.459 --> 54:51.542
- All of you just stop.

54:51.626 --> 54:54.000
- He's talking to invisible monsters.

54:54.083 --> 54:57.334
- No, I'm talking to you.

54:57.417 --> 54:59.375
And you and you.

54:59.459 --> 55:04.751
Sylvia, have some respect,
this is your family.

55:04.834 --> 55:08.751
You don't bring in a lawyer
to break up your family.

55:08.834 --> 55:10.584
And Horace,

55:10.667 --> 55:15.167
do you think you have
no responsibility to everyone?

55:15.250 --> 55:16.751
Never mind what kind
of Horace you are,

55:16.834 --> 55:18.918
what kind of man are you, huh?

55:20.250 --> 55:22.834
And Uncle Pete,
or whatever you are to me,

55:22.918 --> 55:25.459
you want to blame us?

55:25.542 --> 55:27.209
You want to tell
your fucking story?

55:27.292 --> 55:29.125
You want to pour our whiskey
to this stranger

55:29.209 --> 55:31.334
and tell him the 100-year story

55:31.417 --> 55:36.334
of Horace and Petes
and how they were all saints?

55:36.417 --> 55:38.959
Just an unbroken chain
of fucking saints,

55:39.042 --> 55:40.918
Horace after Horace,
Peter after Pete,

55:41.000 --> 55:44.417
not an asshole in the bunch,
and how this place thrived

55:44.501 --> 55:46.125
until this Horace and Pete.

55:46.209 --> 55:49.751
- Sounds right to me.
- Yeah, tell yourself another story.

55:49.834 --> 55:53.459
Yeah, we're probably the worst
Horace and Pete yet.

55:53.542 --> 55:55.334
I'm incompetent
and he's unwilling,

55:55.417 --> 55:59.542
but whose fault is that, huh?

55:59.626 --> 56:01.876
How did this place survive
for 100 years?

56:01.959 --> 56:07.250
A family business,
how did it survive?

56:07.334 --> 56:08.667
(sighs)

56:08.751 --> 56:12.459
- Because all the Horace
and Petes before you

56:12.542 --> 56:14.876
were good fathers,

56:14.959 --> 56:17.000
that's why.

56:17.083 --> 56:21.751
Because they kept
the family together.

56:21.834 --> 56:27.334
Yes, they beat their wives
and they raised their sons right.

56:27.417 --> 56:29.334
What kind of fathers
were you two?

56:29.417 --> 56:31.918
You, the Pete and the Horace
before us, their dad,

56:32.000 --> 56:35.417
who until a minute ago,
I thought he was my dad.

56:38.125 --> 56:40.042
Yeah, you two were lucky.

56:40.125 --> 56:42.000
You fucking lived
somewhere else.

56:42.083 --> 56:43.417
I had to stay here

56:43.501 --> 56:47.542
and watch that guy love
nobody but himself.

56:47.626 --> 56:50.417
Three wives,
he loved none of them.

56:50.501 --> 56:54.542
And you, Pete, what kind of
a father were you?

56:54.626 --> 56:55.834
Look at me, Pete!

56:57.959 --> 56:59.876
Family law?

56:59.959 --> 57:04.042
What kind of a family man are you?

57:04.125 --> 57:09.375
None of us has a claim
to this fucking place.

57:09.459 --> 57:11.584
And I'll tell you something else.

57:11.667 --> 57:15.209
Yeah, I am fucking crazy
and you think that's funny.

57:18.209 --> 57:19.584
Let me tell you this right now.

57:19.667 --> 57:24.209
If you ever talk to Sylvia
the way you did today,

57:24.292 --> 57:29.042
ever again, I'll be the crazy guy
who tore your fucking head off.

57:34.292 --> 57:36.375
- You took the last Probitol, huh?

57:36.459 --> 57:38.209
- Yeah, while I was upstairs.

57:43.334 --> 57:45.626
- This bar belongs
to Horace and Pete.

57:47.209 --> 57:49.417
Marsha gets a cut,

57:49.501 --> 57:53.751
because she was Horace VII's final love,

57:53.834 --> 57:56.334
and I get mine.

57:56.417 --> 57:59.125
And you two can give your sister
whatever she wants,

57:59.209 --> 58:02.042
or whatever you want to give her
because she has no rights here.

58:02.125 --> 58:04.375
- Okay, none of that
will stand up in court, so.

58:04.459 --> 58:07.125
- Well, this has been
a real pleasure.

58:07.209 --> 58:08.626
- None of it will stand.

58:08.709 --> 58:09.792
- Let's go, Sylvia.

58:09.876 --> 58:13.876
- Marsha, as long as I'm alive,
you're okay here.

58:13.959 --> 58:15.834
- Thank you, Pete.

58:24.167 --> 58:25.209
- You got closing?

58:25.292 --> 58:27.417
- I got it.
- Okay.

58:40.626 --> 58:41.918
(Pete)
- Good night, Marsha.

58:43.834 --> 58:44.876
Good night, Sylvia.

58:44.959 --> 58:46.542
- I love you, honey.
- Love you, too.

58:46.626 --> 58:47.876
- Good night.
- Good night.

59:03.083 --> 59:04.792
(toilet flushes)

59:28.501 --> 59:29.542
(door lock turning)

59:29.626 --> 59:31.125
(Rachel)
- Horace?

59:33.626 --> 59:34.918
- Hi.
- Hi.

59:40.459 --> 59:43.584
- Hey.
- Hi.

59:43.667 --> 59:45.459
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

59:45.542 --> 59:48.792
- Ugh, what a day.

59:48.876 --> 59:52.334
I went to the farmer's market

59:52.417 --> 59:56.375
and got some of those
purple green beans.

59:56.459 --> 59:58.125
Mm, you remember them?

59:58.209 --> 59:59.250
- Yeah.

59:59.334 --> 01:00:01.834
- You know, it's so weird,
there's just this one guy

01:00:01.918 --> 01:00:05.542
and that's all he sells.

01:00:05.626 --> 01:00:08.167
You have to come with me
to the farmer's market, Horace,

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.584
it is so sweet.

01:00:09.667 --> 01:00:11.250
These people are farmers

01:00:11.334 --> 01:00:13.876
and they come to Brooklyn
to sell their wares.

01:00:13.959 --> 01:00:17.000
And their eyes are all squinty

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:19.334
from spending their whole lives in the sun

01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:23.667
and- and they have
the soil on their hands and-

01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:28.042
and they just bring the country to the city
with them

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:30.584
and they have this-
I don't know,

01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:34.209
this relaxed look
on their face, you know?

01:00:34.292 --> 01:00:38.834
And it just makes you realize
that we all just worry,

01:00:38.918 --> 01:00:40.542
and we don't have to,

01:00:40.626 --> 01:00:43.459
'cause if you wanted to plant
a seed in the ground

01:00:43.542 --> 01:00:46.417
and just eat what grows,
then you could, you know?

01:00:46.501 --> 01:00:48.459
And this one guy
with the purple green beans-

01:00:48.542 --> 01:00:53.334
He- he is just-

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:55.751
he has this dog and he just
sits in this old chair...

01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:57.042
- Rachel.
- ... which I guess he must have

01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:58.209
brought from the farm, because-

01:00:58.292 --> 01:01:00.501
- Rachel.
- What?

01:01:01.876 --> 01:01:05.751
- Um... I...

01:01:08.417 --> 01:01:11.417
I think maybe
you should move out.

01:01:13.751 --> 01:01:16.334
- What?

01:01:16.417 --> 01:01:20.667
- I feel like I-
I think we rushed into this.

01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:22.751
I don't think that we
thought it through.

01:01:22.834 --> 01:01:24.125
I think that-

01:01:25.501 --> 01:01:27.334
I'm not-

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:29.417
I'm not ready to live with
a woman again

01:01:29.501 --> 01:01:33.584
and it's not fair to you that-

01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:35.334
you know, and I got my kids...

01:01:35.417 --> 01:01:38.083
- Horace, uh...

01:01:38.167 --> 01:01:41.626
- I'm sorry, I just-

01:01:41.709 --> 01:01:44.542
- What are you, um...

01:01:44.626 --> 01:01:45.876
I don't- what are-
you don't-

01:01:45.959 --> 01:01:50.167
you don't mean this.

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.918
- I think I do,
I'm sorry.

01:01:57.125 --> 01:02:01.125
I think I do.

01:02:01.209 --> 01:02:02.751
- You're kicking me out?

01:02:03.876 --> 01:02:05.751
- No, no, no, no, no,
I mean, you can stay,

01:02:05.834 --> 01:02:07.167
until you figure something else.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.626
- Uh-huh, until I figure
something out.

01:02:09.709 --> 01:02:11.375
Because you've-

01:02:11.459 --> 01:02:15.959
you've already figured it
all out, so, um...

01:02:16.042 --> 01:02:17.334
- I'm just saying that
you can stay here-

01:02:17.417 --> 01:02:18.792
you can stay here
until you find a-

01:02:18.876 --> 01:02:20.834
- Okay, okay, oh, my God.

01:02:20.918 --> 01:02:22.417
(chuckling)

01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:25.250
God, uh...

01:02:25.334 --> 01:02:27.584
(groans)

01:02:27.667 --> 01:02:29.417
- Rachel.
- No, don't.

01:02:29.501 --> 01:02:33.209
No, uh-uh, not now.

01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:36.125
(sighs)

01:02:39.501 --> 01:02:43.042
- Well, I-
- Bad job, buddy, real bad.

01:02:43.125 --> 01:02:45.125
Yeah, real bad.

01:02:45.209 --> 01:02:49.125
- I know.
- No, no, you don't know.

01:02:49.209 --> 01:02:50.542
- I'm sorry.
- You don't.

01:02:50.626 --> 01:02:52.626
This is the worst.
The worst.

01:02:52.709 --> 01:02:54.334
Oh, my God.

01:02:56.876 --> 01:02:58.292
(whispers)
- Fuck.

01:03:01.334 --> 01:03:02.876
(sighs)

01:03:09.667 --> 01:03:12.417
- Hey, listen.
- Just- shh.

01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:14.083
- Listen.

01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:18.626
- No.

01:03:27.834 --> 01:03:29.542
- Fuck.

01:03:53.042 --> 01:03:55.417
(sighs)

01:04:04.959 --> 01:04:07.417
Hi, it's-
hi, it's Dad.

01:04:07.501 --> 01:04:08.751
Can you call me, please?

01:04:08.834 --> 01:04:11.000
Just wanted to-

01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:14.000
just give me a call
when you get a minute.

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:15.709
It's Dad, thanks.

01:04:19.292 --> 01:04:20.834
(door opens)

01:04:30.459 --> 01:04:31.959
- How come Rachel was crying?

01:04:36.834 --> 01:04:39.417
- I asked her to... move out.

01:04:40.959 --> 01:04:43.918
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.125
- Man.

01:04:59.834 --> 01:05:04.125
- How long is that-
that last Probitol gonna last?

01:05:04.209 --> 01:05:08.250
- About 12- 12 more hours.

01:05:08.334 --> 01:05:12.209
- Well, bottom line is that
in about three days,

01:05:12.292 --> 01:05:15.792
we can get you more
in three days, then you're back.

01:05:15.876 --> 01:05:20.542
- Okay, then I need you
to lock me in my room

01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:26.334
for the next two days,
and I mean for real.

01:05:26.417 --> 01:05:27.959
- Okay.

01:05:32.209 --> 01:05:35.042
- Look...

01:05:35.125 --> 01:05:38.125
I wasn't lucid the whole time
down there.

01:05:39.667 --> 01:05:42.959
Did I hear Uncle Pete
say that he's my father?

01:05:43.042 --> 01:05:45.542
Eh...

01:05:45.626 --> 01:05:49.250
So we're not even brothers?

01:05:52.083 --> 01:05:54.209
- Well, Pete,
we're in our fifties.

01:05:54.292 --> 01:05:55.751
I mean, what's the difference?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.083
- Yeah.
