Previously on Legacies...
LIZZIE:
There's something

00:04.754 --> 00:06.381
you need to know about Finch--
what she is.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.633
My dad built this school for
people like us. Come with me.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.720
(coughing)
(gasps)

00:11.761 --> 00:14.305
Landon? Landon!

00:14.347 --> 00:16.057
I've been trapped in
an alternate dimension

00:16.099 --> 00:17.684
for what feels like forever,
and I have no idea

00:17.726 --> 00:19.144
how to get out.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.478
CLEO:
You cannot move on from grief

00:20.520 --> 00:23.148
if you are still
holding onto it.

00:23.189 --> 00:26.359
Give him life again
with your art.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.319
HOPE:
Monster problems multiplying.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.280
(snarling)

00:33.074 --> 00:35.201
CLEO: Why do you think
he'd run away?
HOPE: I don't know.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.203
Something about it
felt familiar.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.789
(grunts):
I guess I figured out
who the monster is after all.

00:39.831 --> 00:42.250
I am merely forcing you to
live up to your potential.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.419
Seda...

00:48.381 --> 00:49.549
Landon?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.846
♪ ♪

00:58.933 --> 01:00.477
No, it's not serious.

01:00.518 --> 01:04.022
I just need the artifact back
for a little bit.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.608
Yeah, I'll send somebody to come
pick it up right away.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.026
All right, yeah.
Thanks, Dorian.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.278
Uh-huh. Bye.

01:11.988 --> 01:15.200
You're gonna put Cleo
back in there, aren't you?

01:15.241 --> 01:17.577
Yeah, next time you're
planning something shady,

01:17.619 --> 01:18.953
you should remember that
there are vampires here

01:18.995 --> 01:20.246
that can hear you.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.372
I haven't decided

01:21.414 --> 01:22.707
what to do with Cleo yet, okay?

01:22.749 --> 01:24.042
Not in the long term,
but for now,

01:24.084 --> 01:25.543
it might be best
for everyone's safety

01:25.585 --> 01:26.920
if she's returned
to the artifact

01:26.961 --> 01:28.254
while I figure things out.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.632
Look, I know you guys
are close,

01:30.673 --> 01:32.467
and you're probably here
to tell me I'm wrong.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.219
But I am this school's
headmaster,

01:34.260 --> 01:36.346
and I have the burden of making
these tough decisions.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.597
I get it.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.975
I'm Team Shade, too.

01:41.017 --> 01:44.020
Well, that's not the way things
usually go around here.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.649
Cleo manipulated Hope
by creating a fake Landon,

01:47.690 --> 01:49.400
and then tried to kill her.

01:50.777 --> 01:54.030
Cleo's gotta go.

01:54.072 --> 01:58.118
So I don't need to hear
more from you, Doc.

01:58.159 --> 02:02.580
But from Cleo, before
you put her on ice, that's...

02:02.622 --> 02:03.998
that's a whole other story.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.336
That's between me and her.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.463

02:33.945 --> 02:35.905
(gasps)

02:36.948 --> 02:38.408
Sorry.

02:38.449 --> 02:40.618
Instinct.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.745
I didn't hear you come in.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.539
I got pretty good
at being quiet.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.918
And not half bad at haircuts.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.965
You're pretty jumpy about
people touching your weapons.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.511
I guess I spent more time in the
prison world than I thought.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.143
Well, I will let you
get dressed.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.229
Um, do you...

03:08.271 --> 03:11.733
maybe want to
grab breakfast after?

03:11.774 --> 03:13.776
Was there something
you wanted to ask me?

03:13.818 --> 03:16.279
It can wait.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.031
Meet you in dining hall?

03:25.496 --> 03:27.790
JOSIE:
You know, you can relax.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.918
Nobody here bites.

03:32.837 --> 03:36.341
That was a marginal-at-best
werewolf pun.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.344
I was expecting some sort of
sarcastic response.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.722
Sorry, I'm a little overwhelmed.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.184
Werewolves, vampires, witches.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.810
There's a lot going on
at this school.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.437
Isn't it great?

03:51.689 --> 03:53.024
I'll let you know
how I feel about it

03:53.066 --> 03:55.318
as soon as I figure that out.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.361
Ignore them.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.656
But speaking for this witch,

03:59.697 --> 04:01.824
I'm really glad that
you decided to come.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.993
For breakfast.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.536
We'll see about the rest.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.289
I'm still not sure
this is the right fit.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.583
This place was literally built
for people like us.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.169
Jo, let's be real.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.255
It was built for you
and your sister.

04:15.296 --> 04:18.258
Fair point, but I'm just a
student here like anybody else.

04:18.299 --> 04:21.803
No... you're the headmaster's
daughter

04:21.844 --> 04:23.179
who fits in here.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.640
I'm a loner from
Mystic Falls High

04:25.682 --> 04:27.350
who hates group activities.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.436
Those two things
aren't the same.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.147
Please, just give it a chance.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.024
You gave me
a school tour once.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.360
It's time for me
to return the favor.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.904
I'll try to keep
an open mind.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.617
HOPE:
I thought I'd find you here.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.662
You missed breakfast,
so I brought you this.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.628
I haven't really been around
people in a while.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.717
It's a lot right now.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.761
I have a confession to make.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.973
I used a locator
spell to find you.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.227
I just needed to make sure...

05:11.269 --> 05:12.437
I'm really me?

05:13.604 --> 05:15.565
Smart.

05:15.606 --> 05:19.152
I mean, I know that,
you know, this should be

05:19.193 --> 05:21.863
enough proof, but--

05:21.904 --> 05:24.824
I mean, I keep telling myself,
like, it's actually you--

05:24.866 --> 05:26.451
but, you know, I just...

05:26.492 --> 05:27.952
after everything
that's happened,

05:27.994 --> 05:29.996
I just want to make sure.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.706
Like "dig through all my stuff
when I'm not there" sure?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.958
I was about to
confess that, too.

05:37.211 --> 05:41.466
We've both been through
so much, and...

05:41.507 --> 05:45.219
I'm trying to be patient,
but, I mean,

05:45.261 --> 05:46.888
I have a lot of questions.

05:50.224 --> 05:53.019
And I don't want to
overwhelm you, but...

05:54.771 --> 05:57.648
Help a girl out. I mean,
I'm at a loss here.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.990
I guess I'm still kind
of processing everything.

06:07.408 --> 06:08.951
Can't really put it
into words yet.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.042
I could really use something
to take my mind off it all.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.420
I might have just the thing.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.978
Dr. Saltzman sent
Hope and Landon

06:36.020 --> 06:37.855
to go get the artifact.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.276
Aren't you gonna say anything?
'Cause spoiler alert,

06:42.318 --> 06:44.404
he plans on stuffing
your ass back in it.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.948
So be it.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.617
That's it?
That's all you got for me?

06:52.203 --> 06:53.955
You are the one that insisted
I be honest and real.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.624
And now you're gonna be
tight-lipped about things?

06:56.666 --> 06:59.085
If that ain't hypocritical,
I don't know what is.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.545
I am not a hypocrite,

07:00.586 --> 07:01.754
and I am not the villain
everyone at this school

07:01.796 --> 07:03.297
thinks I am.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.176
I will prove it.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.761
Well, go on and prove it,
then, Cleo.

07:08.803 --> 07:12.348
I can no longer hide
from my past.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.977
It always has a way
of catching up with me.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.854
So I will share my story.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.188
What-what are you doing?

07:19.230 --> 07:20.690
What is about to happen
will feel strange,

07:20.731 --> 07:22.275
but you will be safe.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.402
And do not worry,
I will make sure

07:24.444 --> 07:26.279
you can understand
the language.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.781
No, I don't like the sound
of that. Let-let go.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.408
You came here for answers.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.952
This is how I choose
to give them to you.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.663
Then do the damn thing.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.710
(laughs)

07:40.751 --> 07:42.211
(croaking)

07:42.253 --> 07:43.713
Stop.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.592
(horn bellows in distance)

07:57.768 --> 08:00.062
Cleo? W-Wait. Where you going?

08:00.104 --> 08:03.608
Hey, what--
And where the hell am I?

08:08.988 --> 08:11.073
Grandma, what is happening?

08:11.115 --> 08:12.492
Where are the warriors going?

08:12.533 --> 08:14.368
Good question, grasshopper.
Come, come.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.122
Don't worry, my dear.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.374
Let me tell you a story.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.001
A long time ago,

08:22.043 --> 08:24.795
there was a monster
that lived in the woods.

08:24.837 --> 08:29.008
One day it sought out
a happy and magical village.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.928
It was searching for
something special there.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.514
The monster wanted
that thing so badly

08:34.555 --> 08:38.142
that it threatened to destroy
the village to get it.

08:38.184 --> 08:42.563
So the warriors gathered
to defend their home.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.358
But before they set out
to battle,

08:45.399 --> 08:48.819
a muse used her powerful magic

08:48.861 --> 08:50.530
to get the warriors
to fight

08:50.571 --> 08:53.783
with their words
instead of their weapons.

08:53.824 --> 08:57.495
So the warriors went
into the woods

08:57.537 --> 08:59.247
to talk with the monster.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.083
And the monster agreed
to spare the village

09:02.124 --> 09:05.586
in exchange for what it wanted.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.922
What did the monster want?

09:07.964 --> 09:10.091
(door opening)

09:11.801 --> 09:13.219
It is agreed.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.684
I got a bad feeling about this.

09:21.686 --> 09:25.273
I, uh... I can't
go in there with you.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.899
Are you sure?

09:26.941 --> 09:29.277
I bet Mr. Williams
would love to see you.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.114
When I was in the prison world,
I hid out here one night.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.783
I had a run-in with a monster
who makes you see things

09:35.825 --> 09:37.368
that aren't really there.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.246
I kept hallucinating
I was being rescued,

09:40.288 --> 09:42.290
over and over.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.583
Land, it's all right.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.462
Of course you can
wait out here.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.048
I want to hear the good
and the bad.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.259
We can talk more
on the walk back, okay?
Okay.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.390
Hey, Kirby.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.100
It's been a while.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.148
Miss getting stuffed
in your locker?

10:09.150 --> 10:10.776
CLEO:
Why do you have to go?

10:10.818 --> 10:13.029
To keep the village safe.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.865
Look, I wanted to wait
to tell you this,

10:15.906 --> 10:17.408
but you must know it now.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.910
You're not just a witch,
like your sisters.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.871
You are special, as am I.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.832
You are the seventh daughter
of a seventh daughter.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.167
You are a muse.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.879
Like from the story?
Yes.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.297
What does a muse do?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.174
A muse inspires people.

10:33.215 --> 10:36.010
I use my magic
to help the villagers

10:36.052 --> 10:37.428
because I care about them.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.430
And some day,
you'll become

10:39.472 --> 10:42.725
very powerful,
and they'll need you, too.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.769
That is why I must leave you.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.187
Let me come with you.

10:46.228 --> 10:48.147
No, you cannot.
Because such power

10:48.189 --> 10:50.483
comes with
an obligation.

10:50.524 --> 10:55.404
So I will use it to protect
our home and most of all, you.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.283
Tell your sisters I love them.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.081
I do not want you to go.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.415
Dide ko fo lo.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.547
We have to make
big sacrifices

11:13.589 --> 11:15.925
to keep the people
we care about safe.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.134
What about what you want?

11:17.176 --> 11:18.803
You may not like it,

11:18.844 --> 11:21.305
but I am choosing to do this.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.641
One day you will
understand.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.899
I love you, my granddaughter.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.532
Grandma, no! Grandma!

11:42.118 --> 11:43.452
(crying softly)

12:06.308 --> 12:08.811
You know, you're a total badass
in the future.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.442
It's gonna be okay.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.865
Uh-uh. Oh, damn.
I know that look.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.200
(speaks Yoruba)

12:30.124 --> 12:31.792
Hey. Where are you...

12:31.834 --> 12:33.544
Cleo, where are y...

12:36.088 --> 12:37.381
(low growl)

12:37.423 --> 12:39.008
Malivore?

12:39.049 --> 12:40.968
This bitch is everywhere.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.766
My Cleo, you must not be here.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.726
Hurry home.
No.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.936
You need to protect
our village,

12:50.978 --> 12:53.439
and I will protect you.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.112
I am a muse, too.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.489
Take me instead.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.782
No! Cleo!
(speaks Yoruba)

13:27.807 --> 13:29.975
CLEO:
And now you see

13:30.017 --> 13:32.645
we must make big sacrifices

13:32.686 --> 13:35.022
to keep the people
we care about safe.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.234
You understand that, right?

13:47.868 --> 13:49.829
(people shouting, clamoring)

13:49.870 --> 13:51.539
(grunting, blows landing)

13:56.585 --> 13:57.628
Landon!

14:06.554 --> 14:08.347
What is wrong with you?

14:20.651 --> 14:22.820
Oh, you're coming in hot.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.822
So I'm guessing that means
Cleo didn't give you

14:24.864 --> 14:26.282
the answers you were
looking for.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.033
No. She gave me a
lot more than that,

14:28.075 --> 14:29.702
a-and you can't go
through with this.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.662
This is your feelings
for her talking right now.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.038
Okay? And with all due respect,
it's not your decision to make.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.040
No, she opened up to me.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.625
She showed me
her story. I-I...

14:36.667 --> 14:38.669
I saw her as a little kid.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.087
And Malivore was there.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.256
There doing what?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.258
I-I don't know,
but I-I'm telling you,

14:44.300 --> 14:45.676
we got it all wrong about Cleo.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.177
S-She's not a villain.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.596
Okay? Back in
ancient times,

14:48.637 --> 14:50.389
or whenever the
hell she's from,

14:50.431 --> 14:52.141
s-she was a hero.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.060
She sacrificed herself
to save her grandma

14:55.102 --> 14:56.729
and the entire village.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.732
Of course that's what
she wants you to think.

14:59.773 --> 15:02.484
But whatever she showed you,
however she did it, just know

15:02.526 --> 15:04.361
that she's the one
controlling the narrative.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.823
And if what happened to Hope
is any proof, that's not good.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.869
I was there, Doc.

15:11.911 --> 15:15.831
It was real. I believe her.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.708
And what if she teamed up
with Malivore?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.252
I need more information.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.962
Not a problem. I'm on it.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.340
No, you're not, because you've
already made up your mind.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.846
Hold up, if those are the rules,
then it can't be you, either.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.806
Excuse me?
Oh, come on.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.808
Your mind's been made up
from the jump, Doc.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.894
You're sitting up in here
reading a book about da Vinci,

15:36.936 --> 15:38.854
trying to figure out
how the artifact works

15:38.896 --> 15:40.940
so that you can lock
Cleo away again.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.108
And your track record
of sending problem kids

15:43.150 --> 15:45.235
to prison worlds proves that.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.404
That's a low blow.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.032
But you're not wrong.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.784
I have sent kids away

15:51.825 --> 15:53.827
before I had the whole story,

15:53.869 --> 15:57.164
so like I said,
we need more information.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.750
Okay? Which
means that

15:59.792 --> 16:02.753
neither one of us
is qualified to get it.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.463
So, we need to find

16:04.505 --> 16:06.757
an impartial party.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.135
I know that you haven't really

16:10.177 --> 16:11.887
been around other werewolves,

16:11.929 --> 16:14.932
but this is where
they like to hang out.

16:19.561 --> 16:20.938
Cool.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.232
Hey, Jo. What's up?

16:23.273 --> 16:25.609
Hey, Jed. This is my g...

16:25.651 --> 16:27.361
Finch.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.279
Finch, this is Jed,

16:29.321 --> 16:31.490
the Salvatore School's alpha.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.534
New wolf. Nice.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.952
How much can you bench?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.495
(soft laughter)

16:38.497 --> 16:39.581
FINCH:
What's the next
stop on the tour?

16:39.623 --> 16:40.833
I've seen enough of this one.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.335
ALARIC:
Josie.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.712
I need your help.

16:44.753 --> 16:47.047
Same. Hi.
Hi.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.217
Dad, this is my...

16:50.259 --> 16:52.428
friend Finch.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.722
Finch. Yes.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.390
The transfer.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.725
Potential transfer.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.476
Uh, yeah, cool.
It's so nice to meet you.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.311
I'm sorry for interrupting
what I'm sure

17:01.353 --> 17:03.272
is a phenomenal tour
because of your guide,

17:03.313 --> 17:06.275
but, uh, something urgent
has come up.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.735
You're being vague,

17:07.776 --> 17:09.528
(whispers):
and you're embarrassing me.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.572
Okay, well, then,
maybe we can talk in private,

17:11.613 --> 17:14.491
because it's only gonna
get worse from here. (chuckles)

17:15.659 --> 17:17.411
Nice to meet you.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.706
But you promised.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.249
I know, and I'll be back
before you know it.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.668
Plus, I mean, you're in good...

17:26.336 --> 17:28.130
...good-ish hands.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.590
Okay?

17:29.631 --> 17:31.800
Be back really quick,
really quick. Here we go!

17:35.637 --> 17:37.222
HOPE:
Landon!

17:39.600 --> 17:40.893
Landon.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.439
Are you okay?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.941
I'm assuming that's rhetorical.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.487
Why won't you just ask me the
question you've been working

17:51.528 --> 17:53.572
so hard to avoid?
What happened to you?

17:53.614 --> 17:56.075
You are acting like
a completely different person.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.868
You couldn't possibly understand
what I've been through.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.537
How can I understand if you
haven't told me what's happened?

18:00.579 --> 18:02.414
You want to know
what happened?

18:02.456 --> 18:04.541
After we had sex,
I was trapped in Malivore

18:04.583 --> 18:07.127
for what felt like years,
and I kept telling myself

18:07.169 --> 18:10.506
that any minute now,
Hope will show up and save me.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.299
I had to fight the
Necromancer to escape.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.009
I had to fight my way
out of the darkness,

18:14.051 --> 18:15.803
only to be stuck in a
prison world full of monsters

18:15.844 --> 18:17.721
with no one to help me.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.224
It wasn't about
waiting for you

18:20.265 --> 18:24.394
to rescue me anymore,
it was about surviving.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.979
So I learned how to fight.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.773
And kill.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.359
And every day I woke up
to do it all over again.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.528
But you found a way out.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.655
No.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.281
You did.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.783
What do you mean?

18:37.825 --> 18:38.992
I saw these
black tendrils,

18:39.034 --> 18:43.122
like a rift opening up.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.415
You, Josie and Lizzie
created it.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.793
Sangiema Meam Et...

18:50.462 --> 18:52.798
That's how I got back.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.344
That was weeks ago.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.641
Are you telling me that you've
been back this whole time?

19:08.564 --> 19:10.065
Hi.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.650
Sorry to interrupt.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.485
Where is Kaleb?

19:13.527 --> 19:15.571
My dad actually thought that
I should talk to you instead.

19:15.612 --> 19:18.574
And Kaleb thought
that it was cool, too.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.910
I cannot imagine why.
We do not even know each other.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.620
That's actually why they both
thought it should be me.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.914
Kaleb told me
what happened.

19:29.376 --> 19:33.672
Um, I had a run-in with
black magic not too long ago.

19:33.714 --> 19:37.718
I did terrible things
to the people that I love.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.970
I am not the villain here.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.769
I was told that Malivore took
you as a child.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.314
What did he want?

19:50.355 --> 19:53.025
For me to create.

19:53.066 --> 19:56.528
This is how I learned
to make friends.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.238
That's great.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.949
Isn't that great?

20:00.991 --> 20:03.243
(scoffs softly)

20:03.285 --> 20:05.204
If you have been sent here
to judge me,

20:05.245 --> 20:07.497
that is a decision
you must make for yourself.

20:09.416 --> 20:10.709
(gasps)

20:22.638 --> 20:26.058
Mo gba yin niyanju lati gbe.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.520
Hmm?
(croaks)

20:30.562 --> 20:31.605
(laughs)

20:31.647 --> 20:32.731
(cheers)

20:34.274 --> 20:35.734
Hello, friend.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.735
(chuckles)

20:36.777 --> 20:38.403
He's so cute.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.073
(frog chatters happily)

20:43.158 --> 20:45.035
(low growl)

20:49.289 --> 20:51.375
Look what I made from your mud.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.755
(whimpering, shrieks)

20:58.006 --> 21:01.301
(gasping)

21:01.343 --> 21:04.930
It pains me to relive
these moments.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.724
I never thought I would
find myself in that cave again.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.309
So, Malivore

21:09.351 --> 21:12.479
forced you to create monsters

21:12.521 --> 21:15.399
just so he could eat them?

21:15.440 --> 21:18.068
He was hungry
and desperate by design,

21:18.110 --> 21:20.737
in accordance with the spell
that had created him.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.407
He so acutely wanted to
escape his imprisonment

21:23.448 --> 21:25.492
that he imprisoned me,

21:25.534 --> 21:28.203
believing that I would be
his salvation.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.247
How?

21:38.338 --> 21:40.424
(fire crackling)

21:42.884 --> 21:45.012
CLEO:
I spent many years alone.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.847
I longed for my family,
but my only choice

21:46.888 --> 21:48.265
was to make friends.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.352
Monsters, some would call them.

21:57.232 --> 22:01.403
But Malivore continued
to consume each one,

22:01.445 --> 22:04.781
until one day,
inspiration returned the favor

22:04.823 --> 22:06.742
and smiled upon me.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.623
I would create
a vessel for Malivore.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.167
It would not only be

22:15.208 --> 22:18.503
his salvation, but mine, too.

22:18.545 --> 22:22.215
You inspired Malivore
to want a vessel.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.719
I am the one who gave him the
solution to his hunger problems.

22:25.761 --> 22:29.222
The idea that he has
obsessed over for centuries.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.058
And what he still wants today.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.063
(laughs softly)

22:42.402 --> 22:44.738
You have done well, Cleo.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.823
Given me a voice.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.242
This form is perfect.

22:49.284 --> 22:52.496
Watching you force
yourself into it was not.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.081
My hunger is finally sated.

22:54.122 --> 22:55.499
I have given you your vessel.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.958
So you are finally free
from the confines

22:57.000 --> 22:59.544
of the spell that spawned you.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.671
I want my freedom in return.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.340
(Malivore laughs)

23:03.382 --> 23:07.594
You belong to me, forever.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.263
I cannot let such power go
now that I am free.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.224
Never make a deal
with the bad guy.

23:12.265 --> 23:15.936
I will rid this world of
the creatures that created me.

23:15.977 --> 23:20.023
Vampires, witches, werewolves,

23:20.065 --> 23:23.443
then I will create a superior
species of my own making

23:23.485 --> 23:24.986
to take their place.

23:25.028 --> 23:28.323
This is just the beginning
of our story.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.742
No. It is the end.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.494
For you are more
a prisoner now

23:32.536 --> 23:33.537
than you ever
were before.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.372
You just do not know it yet.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.581
(speaks Yoruba)

23:39.126 --> 23:41.420
Your new form is
indeed perfect,

23:41.461 --> 23:43.713
but I am the one
who controls it.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.674
(grunts)

23:45.715 --> 23:48.009
O le so.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.469
You may speak.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.388
Correction, only make a deal
with the bad guy

23:51.430 --> 23:53.432
when you know
how to screw him over.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.058
MALIVORE:
You are making

23:55.100 --> 23:56.643
a fatal mistake.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.395
Or I have finally been
inspired to be something

23:58.437 --> 24:00.439
greater than your servant.

24:01.064 --> 24:03.233
In time, this vessel
will fail to hold me.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.944
I can feel its weak points
as we speak.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.446
If you do not starve first.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.698
However long it lasts,
this vessel will be

24:09.739 --> 24:11.783
the last comfort my gifts
will ever bring you.

24:12.742 --> 24:13.952
I will break free

24:13.994 --> 24:16.538
and I will find you,
Cleo Sowande.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.249
This I swear!

24:23.086 --> 24:24.838
(roars)

24:31.386 --> 24:32.929
So, you made it back
to this world and thought

24:32.971 --> 24:34.681
that it would be cool to start
cosplaying in the woods?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.141
I was watching the
school from a distance.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.726
I wanted to make sure
everyone was safe.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.436
That nothing came
through the rift with me.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.105
You tried to kidnap Cleo
and then attacked me.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.232
No, I was fighting a
wolf that ambushed me.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.442
The moment I realized
it was you, I...

24:45.484 --> 24:47.319
You ran away.

24:48.945 --> 24:51.698
I didn't want to hurt you.
I was trying to protect you.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.825
I needed to know why Malivore
was after Cleo.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.660
Just like I needed to know
why there was a faux-Landon

24:55.702 --> 24:57.746
running around, so I took a
strand of his hair to test it.

24:57.787 --> 25:00.457
So you knew the truth,
that that thing was an imposter?

25:01.208 --> 25:02.542
Why would you let me
be with him?

25:02.584 --> 25:03.752
The same reason you
let me be with Josie

25:03.793 --> 25:04.878
last year.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.546
You looked happy, I was a mess.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.465
It seemed like
the better option for you.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.467
He was a golem.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.552
If Cleo hadn't
forced your hand,

25:12.594 --> 25:14.054
would you even be here
with me right now?

25:14.095 --> 25:16.306
(rustling)

25:16.348 --> 25:17.849
Something's out there.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.434
If you don't want
to answer the question,

25:19.476 --> 25:20.560
don't pretend
that th...

25:23.480 --> 25:25.106
There's...

25:25.148 --> 25:26.233
A monster?

25:29.694 --> 25:31.196
(roars)

25:38.995 --> 25:41.540
Put the salt down.
We won't need any of it.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.918
(sighs) I see Cleo has
convinced you, too.

25:44.960 --> 25:49.297
She was on her own, imprisoned
by Malivore for years.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.466
And I sympathize.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.052
I chose to do black magic.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.012
I was manipulated, sure,

25:56.054 --> 26:00.559
but Cleo was torn
from her family and forced to.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.061
Before I knew her story,
I thought that our experiences

26:03.103 --> 26:06.940
were similar, too,
but I was wrong.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.526
Right or wrong,
that was in the past,

26:09.568 --> 26:11.444
Dad, because
you put it there.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.196
I almost killed MG

26:13.238 --> 26:15.031
and then I actually
killed Alyssa.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.575
You just let me back
into this school

26:16.616 --> 26:18.785
like nothing happened.
I'm your father.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.620
What was I supposed to do?

26:20.662 --> 26:23.498
If Cleo was your daughter,
would you be doing this to her?

26:25.166 --> 26:27.669
You're the headmaster.
You're in charge.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.171
But you can't play judge,
jury and executioner

26:30.213 --> 26:31.715
with Cleo's life.

26:31.756 --> 26:35.218
You and Mom built this school
to help supernaturals,

26:35.260 --> 26:39.431
not condemn them to
an eternity of loneliness.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.142
So how are you proving
that that's true?

26:45.020 --> 26:46.187
(snarling)
Corporis impetus.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.191
(roars)

26:50.233 --> 26:52.319
(sighs) I feel like
that spell never works.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.904
Or he's immune to magic.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.448
Take this and run.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.284
No.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.368
Landon, we
can go back

27:00.410 --> 27:01.411
to being pissed
at each other.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.912
I need to kill him first.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.206
He wants this.
Monsters are a lot like bullies:

27:05.248 --> 27:07.083
There's no talking to them,
you just got to fight.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.218
I guess we'll have to do
this the old-fashioned way.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.095
(door opens)

27:20.889 --> 27:22.349
You must be lost.
(door closes)

27:22.390 --> 27:24.934
Or have you come to send me
away yourself?

27:26.895 --> 27:28.605
I spoke with Kaleb and Josie,

27:28.647 --> 27:30.649
and they have very strong
feelings about you

27:30.690 --> 27:32.609
after seeing what
you've been through.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.319
They shed some light
on who you are,

27:34.361 --> 27:35.654
but there's a
piece missing.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.030
Why?

27:37.072 --> 27:39.282
Why did you make
a golem of Landon?

27:39.324 --> 27:43.286
And more importantly,
why did you try and kill Hope?

27:44.663 --> 27:46.373
You already know that answer.

27:46.414 --> 27:48.291
You have known it
for quite some time,

27:48.333 --> 27:50.627
you just refuse to accept it.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.630
Then please, enlighten me.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.090
There is no need
for me to inspire

27:55.131 --> 27:58.176
the solution that will
destroy Malivore.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.679
You already have it.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.932
Hope Mikaelson must die.

28:11.439 --> 28:14.109
(panting)

28:21.116 --> 28:22.992
(grunts)

28:32.001 --> 28:33.878
(roars)

28:38.675 --> 28:40.093
Hey...
No! Stay away.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.720
Our blood can't mix.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.433
Fugere.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.980
You dropped this.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.943
I go low. You go high.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.377
I think we make
a pretty good team.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.628
(laughs softly)

29:16.796 --> 29:19.340
Good teams don't
fail their mission.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.895
Do not look at me
like that.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.772
Deep down,
you know that I am right.

29:33.813 --> 29:37.567
Even if you are, what you're
suggesting isn't an option.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.110
It is the only option.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.820
Since I arrived at your school,
I have hoped

29:40.862 --> 29:42.197
to find a different way.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.491
Then show me.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.075
Why should I even bother?

29:46.117 --> 29:47.410
Because I need to see it.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.204
And I think that's something
you know.

29:51.247 --> 29:54.709
So, please, if you will.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.253
Please.

30:02.133 --> 30:07.138
CLEO:
I was sealed
in the artifact for centuries.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.932
It could only be opened
by the one capable

30:08.973 --> 30:12.977
of killing Malivore: Hope.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.979
But I had to learn more
about her and her powers,

30:15.021 --> 30:17.857
so I followed you here,
to the Salvatore School.

30:17.899 --> 30:20.401
Your school seemed
like an ideal place.

30:20.443 --> 30:21.945
One of acceptance.

30:23.738 --> 30:26.658
so when I learned that it was
in need of financial assistance

30:26.699 --> 30:30.119
and that there was a supply
of Malivore mud at hand,

30:30.161 --> 30:31.329
I helped.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.373
(incanting)

30:37.252 --> 30:39.838
Wait, so Malivore
didn't send the leprechaun?

30:39.879 --> 30:41.422
No.

30:41.464 --> 30:44.259
And I did not summon
the Ferryman, either.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.262
I made him.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.018
I made him as I have made
so many monsters

30:54.060 --> 30:55.854
from the mud of Malivore.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.981
(incanting)

31:00.149 --> 31:02.235
But my most important creation

31:02.277 --> 31:06.155
was only necessary because Hope
refused to let Landon go.

31:06.197 --> 31:09.701
I could not have her open up
a portal to the prison world

31:09.742 --> 31:11.619
and risk Malivore's escape.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.289
I made the Ferryman
so that Hope would believe

31:14.330 --> 31:16.332
he had granted her fervent wish.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.209
But the story changed
when Malivore learned

31:18.251 --> 31:19.836
I was still alive.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.379
The monsters that came
after the Ferryman

31:21.421 --> 31:23.798
and Landon's golem
were his doing.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.509
Malivore promised me freedom
from the darkness

31:26.551 --> 31:29.888
in exchange for bringing him
that girl.

31:29.929 --> 31:32.473
CLEO:
And those monsters
were meant to find me,

31:32.515 --> 31:34.100
as he once swore he would.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.894
I did not want
to be his prisoner again,

31:35.935 --> 31:37.395
so I was forced
to switch tactics.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.397
But of course
I had to prevent you

31:39.439 --> 31:40.815
from discovering
my true origins.

31:40.857 --> 31:43.234
I tried to keep you all safe.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.486
The parchment!

31:47.363 --> 31:50.909
But when that proved impossible,

31:50.950 --> 31:52.869
I had to make a terrible choice.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.913
(grunts)

31:54.954 --> 31:57.665
There's nothing I wish to see
more than Malivore destroyed.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.461
That's why you tried
to kill Hope.

32:01.502 --> 32:04.589
She would become a true
Tribrid-- the chosen one

32:04.631 --> 32:06.382
who can defeat Malivore
for good.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.926
But, again, you know that.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.512
Hope has already lost
so much in her life.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.933
Her father, mother,

32:14.974 --> 32:16.893
uncle.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.104
And I won't watch her lose
her human life, too.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.149
Family means everything to her.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.151
And maybe someday
she'll want one of her own,

32:25.193 --> 32:28.821
which would be impossible
if she becomes a full Tribrid.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.700
I understand loss all too well.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.285
After I escaped
from Malivore,

32:34.327 --> 32:36.913
I yearned to return
to my village, but I was afraid

32:36.955 --> 32:38.539
Malivore would follow me there.

32:38.581 --> 32:40.875
Torture my family and friends.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.754
So you ended up in Italy.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.923
It was there that I met
a brilliant young man,

32:46.965 --> 32:48.466
Leonardo da Vinci.

32:48.508 --> 32:51.344
(chuckles)
So I told Leonardo

32:51.386 --> 32:53.388
about the friends
Malivore had murdered.

32:54.347 --> 32:57.642
He sketched them in an effort
to help me heal.

32:57.684 --> 33:00.311
Some of those sketches
I have heard are famous now.

33:00.353 --> 33:03.314
But back then,
they meant he cared for me.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.358
Leonardo had cared
for many men

33:05.400 --> 33:07.318
and women before me,
but he was

33:07.360 --> 33:10.029
my first and only love.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.990
I should've known
it would not last.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.866
Yeah.

33:13.908 --> 33:16.995
I've learned that
the hard way, too.

33:18.496 --> 33:22.709
My grandmother's
precious granddaughters.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.961
She at least was safe
from Malivore.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.088
Having ascended
into the heavens.

33:27.130 --> 33:30.758
I believe she still watches
over me as ancestor.

33:32.301 --> 33:34.762
It was her power running through
my veins that helped me infuse

33:34.804 --> 33:37.640
the artifact
I inspired Leonardo to create

33:37.682 --> 33:39.142
with magic
that could shield me

33:39.183 --> 33:41.185
from Malivore.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.187
(exhales)

33:43.229 --> 33:45.565
We agreed to keep
my existence a secret.

33:45.606 --> 33:48.026
So I parted ways with Leonardo

33:48.067 --> 33:50.445
hoping that one day,
Malivore would be gone,

33:50.486 --> 33:52.572
and I could return to the world.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.159
It wasn't a true life, but...

33:56.200 --> 33:58.244
at least it was painless.

33:58.286 --> 34:01.456
Until you found me, and, well,

34:01.497 --> 34:04.625
now you finally know
my full story.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.669
I'm...

34:06.711 --> 34:09.047
sorry your time with...

34:09.088 --> 34:10.965
da Vinci was cut short.

34:11.007 --> 34:14.427
And I am sorry for everything
that has happened to you.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.638
But...

34:17.680 --> 34:20.892
I need to know that you won't
try and kill Hope again.

34:20.933 --> 34:24.103
In my desperation to do
what I believed was right,

34:24.145 --> 34:27.648
I did not see that history
was repeating itself.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.526
But I will not keep losing
the people I care about.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.737
So as my grandmother
taught me...

34:32.779 --> 34:35.239
that sacrifice is
Hope's to make.

34:35.281 --> 34:38.159
As it should have been
from the start.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.744
Mm-hmm.

34:42.705 --> 34:44.749
(sighs)
But...

34:44.791 --> 34:47.460
what is my fate?

35:01.015 --> 35:02.892
Your fate...

35:02.934 --> 35:05.061
is for you to decide.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.562
Josie and Kaleb
were right.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.147
This school
was created

35:08.189 --> 35:10.566
for students just like you.

35:10.608 --> 35:15.279
And rest assured, you will
always have a place here.

35:15.321 --> 35:16.697
That is...

35:16.739 --> 35:18.616
if you choose to stay.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.292
(grunting)
(crowd clamoring)

35:35.383 --> 35:38.094
Finch!
It's okay, Jo, I got this.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.265
(shouts, grunting)

35:44.934 --> 35:46.686
(shouting)

35:47.854 --> 35:49.397
JED:
Nice move, runt.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.151
Same time tomorrow?

35:53.192 --> 35:54.694
You bet your ass.

35:54.735 --> 35:56.696
Which I will kick again.

35:56.737 --> 35:58.489
We'll see about that.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.449
Go on.

36:03.452 --> 36:05.538
Thanks.

36:08.374 --> 36:11.252
Did... you just
make a friend?

36:12.420 --> 36:14.172
A couple, actually.

36:15.464 --> 36:16.716
The pack's pretty cool.

36:16.757 --> 36:19.177
Everything on
your end go okay?

36:19.218 --> 36:21.304
Uh, yeah... yeah,

36:21.345 --> 36:24.682
if by okay,
you mean me realizing

36:24.724 --> 36:27.351
that I am a spoiled princess,
flitting about a castle

36:27.393 --> 36:29.478
that my daddy built for me...

36:29.520 --> 36:31.439
yeah, yeah, it went awesome.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.067
This place isn't what
I've always thought it was.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.736
I mean, at least,
not for everyone.

36:36.777 --> 36:38.988
So I am so sorry...

36:39.030 --> 36:40.740
that I pressured you.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.158
You do not have
to go here

36:42.200 --> 36:43.701
if you don't want to.

36:44.785 --> 36:47.413
Actually... I do.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.999
On one condition.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.709
When you introduced me earlier,
it was pretty obvious

36:51.751 --> 36:54.128
you didn't know what to call me.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.423
So I was thinking...

36:57.465 --> 36:59.383
girlfriend?

36:59.425 --> 37:01.302
Really?

37:01.344 --> 37:02.261
Yeah.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.388
Yes! Yes!

37:10.061 --> 37:11.729
(laughs)

37:16.359 --> 37:18.611
I know a healing spell for that.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.279
Can you hold
that there?

37:20.321 --> 37:21.697
Yeah, wrap that
around my arm.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.208
Thanks.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.709
♪ The final song... ♪

37:33.751 --> 37:35.294
Look.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.672
I know I've been
rushing things,

37:37.713 --> 37:40.216
but...

37:40.258 --> 37:42.093
it's honestly just
because I'm a little scared

37:42.134 --> 37:43.928
because Cleo told me

37:43.970 --> 37:45.721
that I'm gonna have to become
a fully activated Tribrid

37:45.763 --> 37:47.890
in order to defeat Malivore.

37:47.932 --> 37:51.602
And I don't like
being told what to do.

37:51.644 --> 37:54.647
And I don't want
to do that to you.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.358
So you take
as much time as you need

37:57.400 --> 37:58.943
to tell me what happened to you.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.654
It doesn't matter what it is
or if anything's changed.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.031
You are still the person I love.

38:04.073 --> 38:06.659
That's the problem.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.369
Nothing has changed.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.246
What are you talking about?

38:10.288 --> 38:12.039
You asked me if I would be here

38:12.081 --> 38:14.250
with you right now
if things had been different.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.460
And how--
We will get through this, okay?

38:16.502 --> 38:17.753
We always do.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.380
So there's really
no need to say it.

38:19.422 --> 38:20.089
I have to say it.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.593
I went through hell in that
prison world to stay alive,

38:24.635 --> 38:27.972
only to find you happy
with a perfect version of me.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.890
At first I was angry,

38:29.932 --> 38:32.101
but then I realized
the truth.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.730
The one we can't avoid.

38:36.772 --> 38:38.190
We're doomed.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.071
Anyone else can
believe that,

38:44.113 --> 38:47.158
but not us, because I went
through hell to find you.

38:47.199 --> 38:49.118
And I would do it all over again
if I needed to.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.454
I can't let you do that.

38:54.415 --> 38:56.959
I am the son of Malivore.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.961
You are the loophole
who defeats him.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.213
We exist to destroy each other.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.510
And I want with all of my heart
for it to be different,

39:06.552 --> 39:07.720
but...

39:07.762 --> 39:09.722
Are you breaking up with me?

39:14.310 --> 39:16.479
We should probably stay
far away from each other.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.981
(sobbing)

39:19.023 --> 39:21.275
I mean, where are you gonna go?

39:22.943 --> 39:25.112
I don't know.

39:26.113 --> 39:29.033
I don't belong
at this school without you.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.912
Goodbye, Hope.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.835
(crying)

39:48.302 --> 39:50.388
How'd it go with Cleo?

39:50.429 --> 39:53.265
Well, you and Josie
were right-- I was more

39:53.307 --> 39:55.518
concerned with being
the voice of authority

39:55.559 --> 39:58.396
than in seeing Cleo
for who she really was.

39:58.437 --> 39:59.855
I told her
she was welcome

39:59.897 --> 40:01.774
to stay at the school.

40:03.692 --> 40:05.194
(laughs)
Good.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.029
Um, thanks, Doc.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.948
Uh, you know where I can find
her so I can apologize, too?

40:08.989 --> 40:10.533
I have no idea.

40:10.574 --> 40:11.742
She chose to leave.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.119
I think telling
us her story

40:13.160 --> 40:14.537
brought up a lot
of past pain.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.748
She's looking for
a fresh start.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.583
New beginnings of sorts.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.544
But there was one more thing
I needed to know.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.799
If...

40:26.841 --> 40:28.843
if her being into me

40:28.884 --> 40:31.554
was just part
of her cover story, too.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.934
Doc, we-we got to go find her.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.602
We got to convince her to stay.

40:38.644 --> 40:40.604
Actually, I think she's
the one who's convinced us

40:40.646 --> 40:42.773
that we need
to respect her wishes.

40:42.815 --> 40:45.025
Look, uh... you know,

40:45.067 --> 40:47.361
I really am sorry things
didn't work out the way you

40:47.403 --> 40:48.779
wanted them to, Kaleb.

40:51.657 --> 40:54.160
Where do you think she's going?

40:54.201 --> 40:56.287
(insects trilling)

40:58.164 --> 41:00.249
(exhales)

41:08.757 --> 41:10.885
LANDON:
Hey.

41:10.926 --> 41:12.428
This seat taken?

41:12.470 --> 41:14.680
Landon Kirby.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.765
You kidnapped me.
Yeah.

41:16.807 --> 41:19.101
You tried to murder my...

41:19.143 --> 41:20.519
ex-girlfriend.

41:21.854 --> 41:23.856
Big day for you, too?

41:28.944 --> 41:31.030
(sighs)

41:32.072 --> 41:34.492
I heard you're not the bad guy
everyone thought you were.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.285
I am not.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.537
But I have decided
to leave Mystic Falls.

41:38.579 --> 41:39.872
Where are you headed?

41:39.914 --> 41:42.833
To find another way
to kill Malivore.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.754
Need a hand?
