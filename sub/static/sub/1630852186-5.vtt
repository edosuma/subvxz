00:06.583 --> 00:09.041
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:23.250 --> 00:24.125
God!

00:30.708 --> 00:32.916
No, it isn't going down. Give me another.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.833
-Please, please!
-Another one!

00:34.916 --> 00:36.000
Another shot!

00:47.416 --> 00:49.458
Come on, come on, come on.

00:49.541 --> 00:50.416
What's going on?

00:56.500 --> 00:58.125
Okay, he's better, he's better.

00:59.250 --> 01:00.458
He's fine.

01:28.666 --> 01:30.541
-00:26
-00:25

01:30.625 --> 01:31.833
-00:24
-00:23

02:04.250 --> 02:05.416
How much time is left?

02:06.583 --> 02:07.500
Five seconds.

02:10.041 --> 02:11.791
-00:03
-00:02

02:11.875 --> 02:13.208
-00:01
-00:00

02:16.458 --> 02:19.041
Doors are unlocked.
Everyone, get ready. Come on!

02:20.083 --> 02:24.125
Get ready! Masks on, now!

02:42.583 --> 02:44.875
Smoke! Now!

03:06.250 --> 03:07.083
Silence!

03:07.458 --> 03:08.500
Fuck, be quiet!

03:09.083 --> 03:09.916
It's only smoke.

03:14.375 --> 03:16.041
Not yet. Hold on.

03:18.333 --> 03:21.083
Helicopters, descending in 30 seconds.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.375
Now! We're going out. Come on!

03:32.458 --> 03:35.375
Now. Fast. Everyone out.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.708
Come on. We're going out.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.333
Everyone out. Fast, fast, fast.

03:42.916 --> 03:44.000
Come on! Out!

03:44.083 --> 03:45.333
Come on, come on! Out!

03:45.666 --> 03:46.625
Fast!

04:04.291 --> 04:05.541
What the fuck?

04:05.625 --> 04:06.958
We can't enter through there.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.166
We have to abort.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.666
I don't care about the balconies.
If they have the hostages there,

04:11.750 --> 04:13.125
we'll knock down the main door.

04:13.208 --> 04:16.041
Armored units, move forward!

04:47.708 --> 04:50.375
Come on, come on!
The bad guys are at the door.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.500
I'll open the door and you'll get out,
arms raised high with these boxes.

04:53.625 --> 04:55.125
Is that what you think, orphan?

04:57.083 --> 04:58.333
Fuck.

05:04.333 --> 05:05.875
They're opening the doors.

05:05.958 --> 05:09.083
All the better.
Let's enter with all we have. Now!

05:14.625 --> 05:16.416
I'm telling you to get out there.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.958
Nobody moves.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.625
Get out there, now!

05:19.708 --> 05:23.208
The special forces are arriving.
Nobody move.

05:38.125 --> 05:39.500
What are you going to do?

05:40.208 --> 05:42.541
Are you going to shoot us,
like your daddy was shot?

05:46.875 --> 05:47.708
Nobody move!

05:47.791 --> 05:50.250
Denver! What are you doing?

05:52.208 --> 05:53.041
Denver!

05:53.333 --> 05:54.708
What are you doing, Denver?

05:55.500 --> 05:59.666
And brother, here's the big surprise.
The one you're already thinking about.

06:00.916 --> 06:02.666
White flag!

06:02.750 --> 06:04.125
White flag!

06:04.625 --> 06:06.333
White flag!

06:08.416 --> 06:09.583
What is he doing?

06:10.583 --> 06:11.833
What is he doing?

06:12.250 --> 06:13.500
White flag!

06:14.125 --> 06:15.375
White flag!

06:17.375 --> 06:18.875
<i>Target confirmed.</i>

06:21.000 --> 06:22.875
Denver!

06:35.500 --> 06:38.333
<i>I have the target in sight.</i>
<i>He's in my line of fire.</i>

06:38.416 --> 06:40.125
<i>Requesting permission to shoot.</i>

06:41.500 --> 06:44.291
<i>Requesting permission to shoot.</i>
<i>I repeat, requesting permission to shoot.</i>

06:45.916 --> 06:49.666
<i>A state can accept that they had</i>
<i>to deploy the army on the streets.</i>

06:50.250 --> 06:54.333
A state can allow you to go into
the national reserve and steal the gold,

06:54.416 --> 06:57.916
but there's something
they can't allow happen.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.666
A state can't tolerate
you getting to their secrets.

07:03.500 --> 07:07.166
<i>If we get those red boxes out,</i>
<i>and they see them,</i>

07:07.791 --> 07:10.625
<i>it will only take them a second to realize</i>
<i>what we have in our hands,</i>

07:10.708 --> 07:11.791
<i>and they'll be ours.</i>

07:11.875 --> 07:13.291
Those sons of bitches.

07:13.375 --> 07:16.333
Because in those 24 boxes,

07:16.708 --> 07:19.708
<i>there are the secrets</i>
<i>from the Ministry of the Interior, </i>

07:20.666 --> 07:25.833
<i>Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Intelligence,</i>
<i>and how they spend the reserve fund.</i>

07:25.916 --> 07:27.333
<i>The sewers of the state!</i>

07:27.791 --> 07:31.166
<i>All those things</i>
<i>the system can't allow to go public,</i>

07:31.458 --> 07:35.958
or they'd go down the drain
where their own shit is hidden.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.666
<i>Sons of bitches!</i>

07:43.750 --> 07:45.041
Stop the assault!

07:45.125 --> 07:48.791
<i>I repeat. Abort.</i>
<i>Respect the white flag and withdraw.</i>

07:50.666 --> 07:53.541
Is it possible for those cocksuckers
to dive inside the chamber?

07:53.625 --> 07:54.791
I don't know, Colonel.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.791
<i>-I don't know.</i>
<i>-For God's sake!</i>

08:21.875 --> 08:22.958
Yes!

08:26.375 --> 08:27.291
Yes!

10:50.541 --> 10:53.500
Gay sex is the best in the world,
and do you know why?

10:53.583 --> 10:54.500
It's obvious.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.291
Because there are no women.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.083
You aren't homosexual,
you're misogynistic.

10:59.166 --> 11:02.416
-How were you not born in a cauldron?
-No, ma'am.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.333
Don't mistake misogyny with biology.
They're facts. It's very simple.

11:06.416 --> 11:10.250
We, men, need to get rid of our poison.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.125
Every few hours, we need to boom boom.

11:12.208 --> 11:16.416
Later, we reject the body
that we spilled it onto.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.833
It doesn't matter which body,
we can't help but to reject it.

11:18.916 --> 11:20.166
Then, we say, <i>"Ciao."</i>

11:20.875 --> 11:21.958
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

11:22.041 --> 11:23.666
-Beautiful.
-Homosexual sex.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.666
Sex between women is also homosexual.

11:25.750 --> 11:30.666
Boom, boom, <i>ciao. </i>Two men meet
and they relieve each other.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.541
Boom, boom, <i>ciao. </i>They don't even know
each other's names. Wonderful.

11:33.958 --> 11:35.208
Do you know what's wonderful?

11:35.541 --> 11:38.000
The fantastic fucks women can enjoy.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.125
And we can do it ten times
in succession...

11:40.500 --> 11:42.375
-Or more.
-And multiple orgasms.

11:42.458 --> 11:45.250
We can cum for hours, not in five seconds.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.416
I'm not saying that God didn't give you
the possibility of feeling pleasure,

11:50.500 --> 11:51.916
saying that would be misogynistic.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.625
I am simply saying you don't need it.

11:54.708 --> 11:56.833
-In that case...
-It's not as organic a need

11:56.916 --> 11:58.958
as it is for men. Let me explain myself.

11:59.750 --> 12:03.583
The world is full of saunas
where men meet and relieve each other.

12:03.666 --> 12:07.375
Public parks, public toilets,
where we find each other and do the deed.

12:07.458 --> 12:08.875
It's seminal altruism.

12:08.958 --> 12:10.416
Where are those saunas for women?

12:10.500 --> 12:12.416
-We don't need them.
-You don't?

12:12.500 --> 12:14.000
-Of course not.
-They don't exist.

12:14.083 --> 12:19.291
Where are the public toilets
where you rub your tits? They don't exist.

12:19.958 --> 12:21.875
I'm going to tell you why,
and it's controversial.

12:22.583 --> 12:27.125
That's because female sex
is conditioned by procreation.

12:27.833 --> 12:34.291
In some way or another, you're looking
for a man to exchange genes.

12:34.375 --> 12:37.916
To form a family, which is revolting.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.541
You have too many things in your head.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.958
We have only one. Ejaculate.

12:43.041 --> 12:45.041
That's why we do: boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

12:45.125 --> 12:47.458
Boom, boom, <i>ciao. </i>Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

12:47.541 --> 12:48.958
Gay sex!

12:49.041 --> 12:50.458
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

12:50.541 --> 12:53.666
Look, your theory is fucking shit,
but the rhythm is catchy.

12:53.750 --> 12:54.583
No.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.625
-Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>
-I'm out of here.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.500
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

12:58.583 --> 13:00.125
-Professor!
-Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

13:00.208 --> 13:01.708
-Come on, Professor.
-Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

13:01.791 --> 13:02.958
Professor!

13:03.041 --> 13:04.375
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

13:04.458 --> 13:05.458
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

13:05.541 --> 13:08.125
-Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>
-Let your hair down, Professor!

13:08.208 --> 13:11.208
-Let your hair down, Professor!
-Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

13:11.291 --> 13:12.500
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

13:12.583 --> 13:13.958
<i>Boom, boom, </i>ciao.

13:26.333 --> 13:27.500
Good night.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.416
I can leave, if you want. No problem.

13:39.666 --> 13:40.500
Okay.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.666
We have to be practical, Helsinki.

13:46.458 --> 13:49.750
You were good. You're a titan.
That's true, I can say that.

13:51.416 --> 13:52.875
But we're professionals.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.625
Not like the rest of the idiots
in this gang, right?

13:57.708 --> 13:58.541
Right.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.583
Can you imagine going in there
carrying an emotional backpack?

14:01.666 --> 14:04.125
It's absurd, don't you think?
We pumped out our poison.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.875
We did the boom, boom. And now...

14:05.958 --> 14:06.958
Now, <i>ciao.</i>

14:08.375 --> 14:09.291
No backpack.

14:11.791 --> 14:13.625
Well, now we're blood brothers.

14:13.708 --> 14:17.250
Brothers, pals, something like that.
Aren't we?

14:23.250 --> 14:24.916
Yes, brothers.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.500
What's wrong?

14:49.083 --> 14:50.416
It's better I sleep here.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.666
Tomorrow is a big day.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.041
He fucked you and kicked you out.

14:58.458 --> 14:59.708
What a disgusting asshole!

15:00.166 --> 15:02.708
-Between men, that's the way.
-You're not like that.

15:04.208 --> 15:08.166
I've traveled the world with you,
and you're a teddy bear, darling.

15:08.875 --> 15:12.750
And if you could spend the next 12 hours
cuddling him, you'd prefer that.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.333
We're colleagues. Brothers.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.541
You're not his brother!

15:20.291 --> 15:21.541
Helsinki!

15:23.125 --> 15:24.416
You have to love yourself more.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.583
And get over that disrespectful asshole.

15:30.583 --> 15:35.166
The next time he tells you, "Boom, boom,"
you tell him, <i>"Ciao."</i>

15:35.750 --> 15:38.541
And that he can stick his boom-boom
up his ass.

15:40.875 --> 15:41.708
Okay.

15:46.375 --> 15:47.208
Helsi.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.208
Are you in love?

16:02.416 --> 16:03.416
Brothers.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.583
Damn.

16:14.458 --> 16:15.541
<i>There are weird days.</i>

16:16.833 --> 16:18.750
<i>You should be in an important meeting,</i>

16:19.333 --> 16:22.500
<i>but a while ago, you were clinically dead</i>
<i>and dressed as a diver.</i>

16:23.333 --> 16:24.666
<i>You're still wearing the neoprene,</i>

16:24.750 --> 16:27.291
<i>and you really don't know</i>
<i>if you're dead or alive.</i>

16:34.791 --> 16:38.541
<i>You feel as if you had the biggest</i>
<i>hangover in the world, and you wonder...</i>

16:39.500 --> 16:40.791
<i>"Is this hell?</i>

16:41.708 --> 16:44.833
<i>What did I do wrong?"</i>
<i>You didn't do anything wrong.</i>

16:44.916 --> 16:46.625
<i>Well, the same as everyone else.</i>

16:46.708 --> 16:48.208
<i>Being in the wrong place...</i>

16:48.833 --> 16:50.416
<i>at the worst time of all.</i>

16:52.666 --> 16:53.875
Governor?

16:55.416 --> 16:56.416
Governor?

16:57.583 --> 16:58.791
Governor?

17:00.041 --> 17:01.041
Governor!

17:01.125 --> 17:02.750
Your heart almost exploded.

17:02.833 --> 17:05.750
We injected enough Diazepam in you
for a whole family. Please lie down.

17:06.541 --> 17:07.708
I'm perfectly fine.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.000
Easy, easy.

17:10.666 --> 17:11.500
Be careful.

17:12.208 --> 17:13.041
Be careful.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.916
If you're feeling fine,

17:16.666 --> 17:19.333
come with me. I'm going to show you
what a beauty we've built.

17:19.791 --> 17:21.125
Come, Governor. Look.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.583
Look. What do you smell? Smell!

17:25.583 --> 17:26.458
What's the smell?

17:27.583 --> 17:32.291
That's it! There's no smell.
Industrial extractors.

17:33.583 --> 17:37.458
The gases go through the machine
and they get liquefied.

17:41.125 --> 17:43.625
Then, it goes to the vault.

17:44.791 --> 17:47.125
Atmospheric contamination, zero.

17:47.750 --> 17:52.666
But be careful tomorrow,
because there will be way too much CO2.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.083
Here...

17:54.166 --> 17:57.625
We're melting 52 ingots per hour.

17:58.250 --> 18:01.500
We've already reached cruising speed.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.500
Those are state assets.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.708
And every single drop is there.

18:06.541 --> 18:09.500
We already melted 1600 kilos.
Isn't that right?

18:10.375 --> 18:12.458
How many days have I been unconscious?

18:13.166 --> 18:14.083
Four hours.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.750
Come here, Mr. Mario.
This is the best part.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.208
Look at that.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.583
Look, Mr. Mario. This is the best part.

18:27.666 --> 18:28.541
Come, come.

18:29.541 --> 18:30.916
Look how it spills out.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.333
Look how it spills out. There!
So beautiful!

18:35.666 --> 18:36.750
So beautiful!

18:41.791 --> 18:44.291
Good evening, Governor. Chorizo?

18:45.666 --> 18:48.791
Here, we turn the melted gold into grains.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.458
Pips of gold, like rice grains.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.750
We do everything with bubbles.

18:56.250 --> 18:57.291
It's addictive.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.416
Look at these!

19:09.333 --> 19:11.333
Golden seeds, Governor.

19:11.791 --> 19:16.833
Miss, what you're doing here
will bring countless consequences.

19:17.416 --> 19:20.166
<i>That's the lesson: Nothing is free.</i>

19:21.125 --> 19:23.333
<i>Everything we do has consequences.</i>

19:23.416 --> 19:26.291
<i>Almost a million people surround</i>
<i>the Bank of Spain.</i>

19:26.375 --> 19:28.833
<i>The government is under a lot of pressure.</i>

19:28.916 --> 19:30.500
<i>And the big question, Sara Solomando,</i>

19:30.583 --> 19:34.541
<i>what was in those boxes to make</i>
<i>the police and the army stop the assault?</i>

19:35.083 --> 19:38.875
<i>For now, Cristina, all our questions</i>
<i>have been answered with silence.</i>

19:38.958 --> 19:42.916
<i>Since the assault was aborted,</i>
<i>many official cars have arrived,</i>

19:43.000 --> 19:44.083
from the highest ranks.

19:44.166 --> 19:47.625
Among them, the Minister of the Interior,
the State Secretary of Foreign Affairs

19:47.708 --> 19:49.708
<i>and the Chief of the Defense Staff.</i>

19:49.791 --> 19:52.250
<i>and the crowd was not happy</i>
<i>to see any of them.</i>

19:59.541 --> 20:01.625
<i>The consequences have begun to arrive.</i>

20:03.833 --> 20:07.208
<i>The Minister of the Interior,</i>
<i>the Chief of the Defense Staff,</i>

20:08.083 --> 20:09.791
<i>all of them came to the command center</i>

20:09.875 --> 20:12.625
<i>during the four hours</i>
<i>the governor had been unconscious.</i>

20:13.041 --> 20:15.916
The Prime Minister wants the crowd
to be dispersed immediately.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.208
Tell him that if we disperse
the crowd with water cannons,

20:19.291 --> 20:21.666
tomorrow we won't have
one million people out there, but two.

20:21.750 --> 20:24.125
The European Union
is demanding information.

20:24.708 --> 20:27.125
They want to know if the contents
in the boxes implicate them.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.166
Of course it implicates them,
but they can't know that.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.125
Understood?

20:31.208 --> 20:34.708
Your job is to reduce the diplomatic
pressure so I can do my job.

20:34.791 --> 20:37.166
They already think there must be
something quite big.

20:37.333 --> 20:40.916
They saw how the Spanish forces stopped
an assault against seven delinquents.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.208
<i>Colonel Tamayo had tried it,</i>

20:44.291 --> 20:45.958
<i>but as in a game of chess,</i>

20:46.458 --> 20:49.166
<i>the Professor and Berlin's plan</i>
<i>had changed everything.</i>

20:50.541 --> 20:51.541
<i>One move</i>

20:52.250 --> 20:54.791
<i>and now it was them</i>
<i>who were under the threat of a checkmate</i>

20:56.041 --> 20:59.541
<i>against the king and the rest</i>
<i>of the government's institutions.</i>

21:04.833 --> 21:08.541
<i>The contents of those 24 boxes</i>
<i>took less than an hour to get to Pakistan.</i>

21:09.791 --> 21:13.250
<i>Our legion of hackers opened</i>
<i>a secure and undetectable email account</i>

21:13.583 --> 21:15.208
<i>through an opaque satellite.</i>

21:15.916 --> 21:18.916
<i>If we published that information,</i>
<i>they would be dead.</i>

21:20.375 --> 21:21.291
<i>And they knew it.</i>

21:22.750 --> 21:24.666
What's the real size of the leak?

21:29.500 --> 21:30.333
Colonel?

21:32.666 --> 21:33.500
Minister.

21:40.541 --> 21:41.875
The size of the leak...

21:44.750 --> 21:48.083
Europe causing a war in Libya
because of personal interests.

21:48.291 --> 21:51.708
Payments to Morocco in exchange
for leaving immigrants in the desert.

21:51.791 --> 21:54.583
The confidential agreement to look away
from the Mediterranean.

21:54.666 --> 21:58.208
Seventy-four shipwrecks that could've
been avoided, hundreds drowned.

21:58.291 --> 22:00.041
Even if it sounds old, all the details

22:00.125 --> 22:03.333
about the creation of a terrorist group
in the south of France. Do you want more?

22:04.416 --> 22:07.833
The contents of those boxes condemn
this government and the previous ones.

22:07.916 --> 22:11.125
The shit is going to land on Spain,
the European Union, and NATO.

22:11.208 --> 22:12.333
And what's worse...

22:12.583 --> 22:15.750
we'd be bringing ourselves down.
You, you, you and me.

22:17.541 --> 22:21.458
Are we willing to end up in the court?
Is that what the prime minister wants?

22:21.958 --> 22:25.291
Is there any prime minister in Europe
who wants to go to jail?

22:31.125 --> 22:33.166
That's the size of the fucking leak.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.291
We can't negotiate with that man.

22:36.875 --> 22:39.291
If he has the secrets,
he will always be a threat.

22:40.958 --> 22:42.125
So?

22:44.708 --> 22:46.000
What do you propose?

22:47.041 --> 22:48.291
We can only do one thing.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.791
You know it well.

23:11.041 --> 23:15.583
Good evening, I'm Alicia Sierra,
for those who don't know me.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.583
And I'm going to be in charge
of the robbery's negotiations.

23:18.958 --> 23:20.166
Let the party begins.

23:20.875 --> 23:24.958
I want three little things.
I know you can do it.

23:25.291 --> 23:31.500
I want to know how much gasoline they have
to feed the emergency generators.

23:31.583 --> 23:33.083
Second,

23:34.416 --> 23:36.416
bring in the underground teams

23:36.500 --> 23:38.333
so they can tell me exactly
what's under there.

23:38.416 --> 23:41.208
Tunnels, galleries, sewers.

23:41.625 --> 23:43.125
Okay? And third,

23:44.541 --> 23:45.500
Antoñanzas.

23:47.041 --> 23:48.000
Antoñanzas?

23:48.083 --> 23:48.916
Inspector?

23:49.875 --> 23:55.958
Okay. Donuts, licorice, lollipops,
and that melon-shaped gum.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.875
My hormones are all over the place

23:57.958 --> 23:59.875
and I need to seem like a sweet,
empathetic woman

23:59.958 --> 24:02.708
when I talk to that fucking Professor.
How's that sound?

24:03.083 --> 24:05.208
Everything's peachy.
I leave you in charge.

24:07.166 --> 24:08.541
Okay. Come on.

24:13.791 --> 24:14.833
Martínez.

24:14.916 --> 24:17.708
Inspector, we're trying
to triangulate the calls.

24:17.791 --> 24:18.958
Inspector.

24:19.041 --> 24:23.375
<i>What country was he detained in?</i>
<i>Why was he brought in a secret plane?</i>

24:23.458 --> 24:24.791
The pregnant woman who tortures.

24:24.875 --> 24:27.708
Even the monkeys from Madagascar
are going to know about me.

24:27.791 --> 24:29.416
He fell like a rag doll.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.041
Go and get me some chewing gum.

24:34.125 --> 24:36.500
ALLEGED ILLEGAL INTERROGATION

24:37.833 --> 24:38.666
I look fat.

24:41.291 --> 24:42.208
I look fat.

24:44.291 --> 24:48.750
Yesterday, we were discussing how to
buy time if we're arrested here, in Spain.

24:48.833 --> 24:52.416
But what happens
if we're able to rob the Royal Mint,

24:52.500 --> 24:55.083
escape with the money,
and then, after some time,

24:55.166 --> 24:57.666
Interpol arrests us in a foreign country?

24:58.166 --> 25:02.125
In all likelihood,
they will hold us in that country to...

25:02.916 --> 25:07.041
well, to make use of what they call
enhanced interrogation techniques.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.333
Torture.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.958
The only good news is that

25:13.041 --> 25:15.750
at a certain time,
we can use it to our advantage.

25:15.833 --> 25:18.791
Using torture to our advantage? Cool.
How come I didn't think of that?

25:18.875 --> 25:20.333
Even if they sidestep the law,

25:20.416 --> 25:23.250
even if they sidestep the laws
guaranteeing our rights, sooner or later,

25:23.333 --> 25:28.166
they have to bring us back to Spain,
and that means transfers, vans.

25:28.416 --> 25:32.083
That's the moment in which
you have to look completely destroyed,

25:32.166 --> 25:33.708
because there's always someone looking.

25:33.791 --> 25:37.291
And if the people see and feel
that brutality...

25:38.333 --> 25:40.916
that's when we have
our chance to negotiate.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.458
Did you come from the bathroom?

25:46.458 --> 25:47.291
Yes.

25:48.125 --> 25:52.250
Did you go to deposit your solid detritus
at 12:00 p.m. in the shared bathroom?

25:52.333 --> 25:55.750
To shit? Yes. Is there any problem?

25:55.833 --> 25:59.125
That's the bathroom we all use,
what if I have to go now?

25:59.208 --> 26:01.458
Then light a match, for fuck's sake.

26:02.166 --> 26:05.541
Or cover your nose with that finger
you always have up your ass

26:05.625 --> 26:07.791
and that makes you be so standoffish.
You have options.

26:09.458 --> 26:12.083
Do you know what smell is?
Smells are particles.

26:12.166 --> 26:15.583
Particles that were in the grime
of your intestines,

26:15.666 --> 26:18.083
placidly flying around and they got out...

26:18.500 --> 26:22.625
with your detritus, through your anus,
laying waste to everything!

26:22.708 --> 26:25.500
And now I have to accept it
going into my nose?

26:25.583 --> 26:27.041
Then, cover your fucking nose.

26:27.125 --> 26:28.375
What, you don't shit?

26:28.458 --> 26:32.458
Every day, religiously, like a watch,
but in the wee hours of the morning.

26:32.541 --> 26:35.875
First, because of privacy,
but especially, out of respect...

26:35.958 --> 26:38.375
-Respect, you say?
-Out of respect.

26:38.458 --> 26:41.916
I don't think anyone has to inhale
the particles of my shit.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.250
Let's not get too refined.

26:43.333 --> 26:45.250
If we start with the taboo
against taking a dump,

26:45.333 --> 26:47.166
we'll end up calling each other "mister."

26:47.250 --> 26:49.291
-I like to be called "mister."
-What a surprise.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.291
Look.

26:52.250 --> 26:56.750
I know I am not
an elegant man like you, mister.

26:56.833 --> 27:00.333
I know I don't know
as many things as you do, mister.

27:01.083 --> 27:05.958
And I only know how to open holes where
not even God would dare to open them.

27:06.541 --> 27:07.666
But most importantly,

27:08.333 --> 27:12.083
I would risk my life for my people,
if it were necessary.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.333
And the question is...

27:17.291 --> 27:20.375
are you part of my team or not?

27:20.750 --> 27:22.708
The question is
if I would risk my life for you.

27:22.791 --> 27:24.000
That's the question.

27:26.125 --> 27:31.333
The answer is that, despite your habits
learned in a shit-hole boarding school

27:31.833 --> 27:34.583
and your fondness for crosswords,
if we go into the Mint together...

27:37.000 --> 27:38.125
we'll get out together.

27:54.375 --> 27:57.291
So, are we all friends again? Yes?

28:00.250 --> 28:01.166
Great.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.958
What we were talking about
is very important.

28:05.958 --> 28:08.666
We all run the risk of being arrested.

28:12.333 --> 28:13.166
Let's see.

28:18.458 --> 28:21.541
Palermo?
Can you see anything with that eye?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.791
I see your Russian Orthodox beard,
fucking Serbian.

28:26.125 --> 28:27.916
Or is it Jeremiah Johnson's beard?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.041
What I don't see is the fucking mule.
Where did you leave it?

28:32.250 --> 28:33.458
I can see fine, fatty.

28:33.541 --> 28:34.583
Let's see the other eye.

28:46.375 --> 28:50.083
Don't worry. Your eye needs to heal.
It will be better tomorrow.

28:51.458 --> 28:52.708
Let's put the patch on.

29:00.291 --> 29:01.666
I'm going to grab a cane.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.041
Palermo, are you there?

29:20.500 --> 29:21.916
Eagle eye! I'm listening, Professor.

29:22.000 --> 29:22.833
Is Tokyo there?

29:26.125 --> 29:27.125
Yes, she's here.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.333
Professor.

29:42.125 --> 29:43.000
Tokyo...

29:46.250 --> 29:47.500
Rio is in Spain.

29:59.083 --> 29:59.916
Thank you.

30:01.875 --> 30:03.541
I hope I'll be able to hug you...

30:04.250 --> 30:06.125
<i>and thank you in person very soon.</i>

30:07.208 --> 30:08.041
Of course you will.

30:13.541 --> 30:17.000
<i>Tokyo, we still have to do the most</i>
<i>difficult part, but we'll get it done.</i>

30:18.666 --> 30:19.916
We'll get it done.

30:32.875 --> 30:33.958
<i>All actions,</i>

30:35.000 --> 30:35.916
<i>all of them,</i>

30:36.000 --> 30:37.250
<i>have consequences.</i>

30:37.875 --> 30:39.041
<i>And the police...</i>

30:39.125 --> 30:39.958
Colonel!

30:40.041 --> 30:41.541
<i>...in the darkest time,</i>

30:42.041 --> 30:43.291
<i>were going to see a light.</i>

30:43.375 --> 30:46.416
-We're starting to triangulate the signal.
-Like a mobile phone?

30:46.500 --> 30:48.166
It isn't as precise, by a long shot.

30:48.250 --> 30:50.166
UIT has receivers everywhere in Spain.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.250
The signal turns up in Galicia,
Alicante and even the rest of Europe.

30:54.333 --> 30:57.083
But it emits more intensively
from the south of the peninsula.

30:57.916 --> 31:00.791
-I think they're transmitting from there.
-How precise is this?

31:02.833 --> 31:04.041
This is the radius.

31:06.458 --> 31:09.916
He's running the robbery from the beach?
On holiday with his cousin Rosita?

31:10.000 --> 31:10.833
Come on!

31:10.916 --> 31:14.583
It doesn't make sense for him to be close.
He did this in the previous robbery, sir.

31:14.666 --> 31:17.500
He will take for granted that we'll search
every building in the area.

31:17.583 --> 31:20.500
So they went to Portugal,
Andalusia, Morocco?

31:20.583 --> 31:22.208
Every place is safer than Madrid.

31:22.916 --> 31:24.666
He only needs a phone and a radio.

31:26.625 --> 31:28.291
Colonel, he knows our protocols.

31:29.166 --> 31:32.208
And there aren't any about investigating
a robbery with hostages 400 miles away

31:32.625 --> 31:33.750
from the crime scene.

31:35.208 --> 31:36.708
What happens if you go there?

31:37.541 --> 31:40.375
-Well, the area is still very wide.
-Fuck that, Angel!

31:40.458 --> 31:43.208
-We need to narrow it down.
-Go there, right now!

31:44.791 --> 31:46.375
And absolute discretion.

31:46.958 --> 31:48.500
I would rather have you there

31:48.583 --> 31:50.625
than a couple of Civil Guards
from a small town

31:50.708 --> 31:52.125
that would only scare them away.

31:52.208 --> 31:53.333
Martínez! Come here!

31:53.416 --> 31:54.250
Yes.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.125
You're going to work with him.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.250
Study this signal exclusively.
Only this one.

32:01.583 --> 32:02.583
Okay.

32:02.666 --> 32:05.041
And this stays between us.
Don't tell anyone.

32:25.291 --> 32:28.250
I would love to do a trip like this
with you some weekend.

32:29.666 --> 32:31.708
I mean, without having to rob anything.

32:31.791 --> 32:33.333
Yes, it could be our honeymoon.

32:33.416 --> 32:34.625
Yes.

32:36.416 --> 32:38.958
Well, for that we would need
to marry first.

32:39.416 --> 32:42.541
Well, I'm already living with your mother.
Marrying you wouldn't be an issue.

32:42.625 --> 32:43.500
Excuse me?

32:45.041 --> 32:47.208
-What the fuck was that?
-Excuse me?

32:47.291 --> 32:51.958
Marrying you wouldn't be an issue?
Are you fucking kidding with that?

32:52.041 --> 32:54.666
You're just put it out there
and then puss out?

32:54.750 --> 32:56.250
-It was just a comment.
-Forget it.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.208
Forget it, because you're making it worse.

32:59.166 --> 33:00.291
Call Marseille.

33:01.708 --> 33:02.541
Yes.

33:02.625 --> 33:03.500
Hey...

33:04.458 --> 33:05.916
if you want to marry me,

33:07.333 --> 33:09.041
ask for my hand properly.

33:12.333 --> 33:13.916
Look for a place to pull over.

33:39.458 --> 33:40.291
PRIETO

33:49.666 --> 33:51.208
Inspector. It's him.

34:03.958 --> 34:04.833
Professor.

34:07.333 --> 34:10.583
Inspector Sierra? What a joy!
I was looking forward to talking with you.

34:11.958 --> 34:14.791
Yes, I know you like to negotiate
with policewomen.

34:15.666 --> 34:17.750
Aren't you going to ask me
what I'm wearing?

34:18.416 --> 34:19.791
I imagine maternity clothes.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.208
Oh, how old-fashioned you are!

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Are you one of those men
who wear undershirts?

34:25.500 --> 34:27.458
Actually, I am, but...

34:29.250 --> 34:31.833
Inspector, the classics never die.
Don't you think?

34:32.500 --> 34:36.125
Alas, you can look like Pablo Escobar
with an undershirt

34:36.791 --> 34:38.958
or like Marlon Brando
in <i>A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

34:40.583 --> 34:41.416
Touché.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.875
Tell me, then.

34:43.291 --> 34:45.250
Have you ever recorded yourself
making love?

34:47.083 --> 34:48.166
Let me think...

34:51.000 --> 34:52.666
No, the truth is I haven't.

34:54.083 --> 34:57.416
I guess I've always had qualms about it
because I'm a shy man.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.125
In that case, I can help you.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.166
Raquel!

35:03.750 --> 35:04.916
You are listening, aren't you?

35:05.750 --> 35:06.833
Raquel?

35:09.208 --> 35:11.541
Hello, Alicia. Long time no see.

35:11.625 --> 35:12.875
A long time, yes.

35:12.958 --> 35:16.375
I'm surprised your Professor is too shy
to ask you to record yourselves

35:16.458 --> 35:17.666
<i>having sex.</i>

35:17.750 --> 35:19.791
<i>You did it in the second year of Academy.</i>

35:19.875 --> 35:22.666
With Hortigosa. Fuck!

35:23.958 --> 35:25.541
Alicia, you disappoint me.

35:25.625 --> 35:26.958
<i>Listen.</i>

35:27.041 --> 35:28.583
I'm going to tell you what you're doing.

35:32.500 --> 35:35.208
You're trying to take control
of the conversation

35:35.291 --> 35:39.583
with a friendly disposition, and then
you will drop a bomb to try to divide us.

35:40.250 --> 35:41.750
Negotiations 101.

35:41.833 --> 35:44.541
Not at all.
I was only entertaining myself.

35:46.541 --> 35:48.458
I'm dropping the bomb now.

35:50.458 --> 35:54.250
You've been classified as terrorists,
so I got the CIA, Interpol,

35:54.333 --> 35:57.291
<i>and fucking everyone searching</i>
<i>for your mother and your daughter.</i>

35:58.250 --> 35:59.500
<i>I don't know where they are,</i>

36:00.375 --> 36:03.958
but I'm guessing you didn't run away
to Norway,

36:05.208 --> 36:08.833
but to an idyllic country
with a poor, inefficient police force.

36:10.208 --> 36:11.958
South Asia, for example.

36:13.833 --> 36:15.000
That's what I would do.

36:16.291 --> 36:18.958
Do you know what's bad
about those countries, Raquel?

36:19.625 --> 36:20.958
You tell me, Alicia.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.000
The jails.

36:29.166 --> 36:30.208
<i>They're disgusting.</i>

36:30.708 --> 36:32.125
<i>Overcrowding, infections...</i>

36:32.500 --> 36:34.041
<i>drugs and killings.</i>

36:35.083 --> 36:37.333
<i>All kinds of things,</i>
<i>and your mother is there!</i>

36:37.416 --> 36:39.791
With her age and how confused she is.
And Paula?

36:40.416 --> 36:41.625
Little Paula?

36:42.291 --> 36:44.291
<i>I can delay an extradition</i>
<i>for a long time,</i>

36:44.375 --> 36:47.750
<i>I can't imagine her there,</i>
<i>crying every night</i>

36:47.833 --> 36:51.000
in an orphanage in Jakarta.
Damn, poor girl.

36:51.083 --> 36:54.666
<i>Congratulations, Raquel. Great job.</i>
<i>You won a wimp.</i>

36:54.750 --> 36:58.250
I'm sure he's one of those who only want
sex once a month, and you lost a family.

37:00.375 --> 37:03.458
If you hand over the Professor,
I will leave them alone.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.083
Why did you tell her that?

37:14.166 --> 37:17.041
Because this is a card game,
and I went all-in.

37:18.041 --> 37:21.083
And now they will be fucked for a while.
And that's what the game is about.

37:21.875 --> 37:22.708
Screwing someone.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.000
Calm down.

37:50.416 --> 37:53.041
-It was a bluff.
-You called and you lost control.

37:53.125 --> 37:54.500
You took my control away.

37:54.583 --> 37:56.750
She was playing you.
She manipulated you.

37:56.833 --> 37:57.666
Me?

37:57.750 --> 38:00.416
-And you were smiling like a puppet!
-She manipulated you!

38:01.250 --> 38:03.875
She hung up
and we didn't even play our cards.

38:07.833 --> 38:10.208
She went after you
because you're the weak link.

38:41.833 --> 38:42.791
Hey, mutt!

38:43.833 --> 38:44.708
Bring me water.

38:44.791 --> 38:45.791
What did you call me?

38:47.583 --> 38:48.625
Mutt.

38:49.166 --> 38:54.500
But I can also call you doner kebab,
gypsy or melon seller.

38:56.958 --> 38:59.666
Do you want to go nose-to-nose with me
and piss me off?

38:59.750 --> 39:00.750
I don't.

39:00.833 --> 39:04.708
I don't even want to think of the number
of asses that nose has been in.

39:09.666 --> 39:11.250
You're Gandía. Aren't you?

39:20.291 --> 39:23.458
Is it just me or is there
a lot of negativity in the air?

39:23.541 --> 39:25.208
Very bad vibes.

39:25.791 --> 39:27.708
Take me to him, I want to talk to him.

39:29.750 --> 39:31.083
Leave us alone.

39:33.541 --> 39:35.208
He's sitting in front of you.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.333
I smell sulfur.

39:50.708 --> 39:52.166
I don't see very well, but...

39:54.875 --> 39:56.750
I'm developing other senses.

39:59.666 --> 40:02.375
And my intuition tells me
that you don't respect us.

40:03.375 --> 40:05.583
It's what jerks with masks deserve.

40:06.666 --> 40:08.208
They don't command respect.

40:11.625 --> 40:14.625
A logical thought coming
from someone of your position,

40:14.708 --> 40:16.541
but you're wrong about me.

40:17.958 --> 40:20.333
You watched too much TV.
Do you think we're Robin Hood?

40:20.916 --> 40:23.458
That we're adorable teddy bears
with Dalí masks?

40:26.333 --> 40:32.166
What I think is that you're a <i>sudaca,</i>
one-eyed, faggot son of a bitch.

40:35.416 --> 40:36.333
<i>Sudaca.</i>

40:39.250 --> 40:41.166
Yes, I'm <i>sudaca.</i> That's true.

40:43.166 --> 40:45.500
But I'm from the German school. Berlin's.

40:47.750 --> 40:48.833
Don't move!

40:49.166 --> 40:50.791
I love <i>piñatas.</i>

40:51.958 --> 40:52.916
Don't move!

40:53.208 --> 40:54.125
Son of a bitch!

40:55.208 --> 40:56.958
-Palermo!
-Don't move! Don't move!

40:57.625 --> 41:01.500
I am the <i>sudaca </i>that's going to repatriate
the gold you plundered, asshole.

41:01.583 --> 41:03.166
Denver, stop him!

41:05.333 --> 41:06.750
Palermo! Denver, stop him!

41:06.833 --> 41:10.833
Gold bathed in American blood!
Satanic, ritualistic!

41:11.416 --> 41:13.666
-Fucking reptile!
-Stop!

41:13.750 --> 41:16.750
Better kill me. If not, I'm going
to rip your intestines out of your ass

41:16.833 --> 41:19.250
-with a pair of pliers.
-I'm going to kill him!

41:19.333 --> 41:21.041
Son of a bitch! Come here!

41:21.125 --> 41:22.083
I'm going to kill you!

41:22.166 --> 41:23.583
Nobody move!

41:23.666 --> 41:27.000
Come here and hit me harder!
Hit me harder! Son of a bitch!

41:27.916 --> 41:30.625
Son of a bitch! Come here!

41:31.541 --> 41:35.083
You've put us on the same fucking level
as the Taliban.

41:35.750 --> 41:37.291
What were you trying to prove?

41:37.750 --> 41:38.583
Authority?

41:39.250 --> 41:41.583
Beating up a guy that's tied down?

41:41.666 --> 41:43.625
You only proved
that you're a piece of shit!

41:43.708 --> 41:48.583
Then untie him and I'll beat him up with
just one hand! That fucker, bring him!

41:48.666 --> 41:51.958
This fucking psycho
is who the Professor put in charge?

41:52.041 --> 41:55.916
No, no, no. Listen to me, Palermo.
Here we have a plan and we have rules.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.791
The Professor's rules.

41:58.166 --> 41:59.541
And he's the one in charge.

41:59.625 --> 42:04.791
Where the fuck is the Professor?
Where is Mr. Professor? He's never here!

42:05.750 --> 42:08.083
Raise your hand if you have
the scepter of command!

42:08.166 --> 42:10.500
I have the scepter of command!
I'm the one in charge!

42:10.583 --> 42:11.708
Easy, easy.

42:22.333 --> 42:25.208
I'm going to explain something to you
about the rules,

42:27.500 --> 42:29.291
the son of a thousand bitches

42:30.875 --> 42:35.000
who dares to insult any member
of the team, I will break his skull.

42:36.833 --> 42:39.208
And you, mutt, you will stay silent.
Did you hear me?

42:40.625 --> 42:44.458
Unless you want to open your mouth
to thank me

42:45.375 --> 42:48.125
because I defended you,
for example. What do you say?

42:49.166 --> 42:53.625
I don't need a piece of crap like you
to defend me.

42:53.708 --> 42:57.625
Don't you realize that in the same way
you've beaten up a defenseless guy,

42:57.708 --> 43:01.250
I could grab my rifle, crack your skull,
leave you fucked...

43:02.333 --> 43:03.166
and take charge.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.041
Really?

43:08.458 --> 43:09.541
Helsinki, tie her up.

43:11.625 --> 43:15.500
Tie up her hands and feet, and take her
to the forge for mutiny. Right now.

43:18.250 --> 43:20.625
Don't even think about it. Helsi, Helsi!

43:21.291 --> 43:22.125
-Nairobi.
-Helsi.

43:22.208 --> 43:23.166
"Helsi?"

43:24.750 --> 43:27.541
"Oh, Helsi." Sorry.

43:28.375 --> 43:33.083
I think you're addressing him from
your emotional backpack. Am I right?

43:36.333 --> 43:39.083
Do you really think
you can be Helsinki's woman?

43:42.791 --> 43:47.208
What, Nairobi?
Following an impossible love? Why is that?

43:48.291 --> 43:52.958
Are you lying to yourself?
Or do you want to play mommy?

43:56.375 --> 44:01.458
I regret to inform you the only role
you can assume now is the faggot's friend.

44:02.250 --> 44:06.291
You're the fucking fag hag.
I'm sorry. Helsinki loves me.

44:06.375 --> 44:07.625
I'm sorry.

44:07.708 --> 44:11.458
Let me tell you something that you need
to know, because you're old enough.

44:11.750 --> 44:15.583
In the relationships of love,
we have the lover and the beloved.

44:16.083 --> 44:21.875
The lover lives the relationship
with passion, devotion, and romanticism.

44:22.291 --> 44:23.250
The beloved...

44:24.916 --> 44:26.791
simply enjoys being worshiped.

44:27.500 --> 44:29.166
I'm not saying being a lover
is a bad thing.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.875
Don't get me wrong, please.

44:30.958 --> 44:32.125
But do you know what?

44:33.625 --> 44:35.750
Lovers suffer a lot, dear.

44:37.541 --> 44:38.875
Whereas, I have my fun.

44:39.458 --> 44:42.708
The only yield I get is sex.

44:43.125 --> 44:45.833
It's the fucking law of love, Nairobi.
I'm sorry. It's the way it is.

44:51.625 --> 44:56.166
The only miserable one
in this whole story...

44:57.500 --> 44:58.333
is you.

44:59.166 --> 45:03.250
With your speech about love,
and "Boom, boom,<i> ciao." </i> Wow.

45:05.083 --> 45:08.583
That's because...
you are too coward to admit the truth.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.875
The only truth is the reality.

45:13.458 --> 45:17.458
And I'm going to explain it to you.
Look. You love fatty.

45:18.500 --> 45:19.583
Fatty loves me.

45:20.500 --> 45:23.541
And I don't love anyone.
And that's precisely why...

45:25.458 --> 45:26.416
you hate me.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.333
You don't love anyone?

45:31.291 --> 45:33.166
Of course you don't, darling.

45:35.208 --> 45:36.833
You don't have the balls for it.

45:38.375 --> 45:39.833
To love you need courage.

45:41.500 --> 45:43.041
I have courage. Look.

45:44.625 --> 45:45.458
Helsi.

45:48.041 --> 45:50.583
I love you. I love you so much...

45:53.000 --> 45:54.750
that I would have a family with you.

45:57.250 --> 45:59.583
See? This is bravery.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.666
I feel it and I say it.

46:05.708 --> 46:06.541
And that...

46:07.291 --> 46:08.500
you don't know how to do.

46:10.208 --> 46:11.291
How long has it been?

46:12.208 --> 46:15.208
Ten years? You were in love
with Berlin for ten years?

46:15.750 --> 46:17.750
And you never dared to tell him.

46:20.750 --> 46:25.208
Of course. You worshiped him
and followed him like a dog.

46:26.666 --> 46:27.666
And that's it.

46:29.875 --> 46:30.833
Now what?

46:31.666 --> 46:32.875
Nothing is possible now.

46:34.541 --> 46:35.375
He's dead.

46:38.375 --> 46:39.500
And you're empty.

46:42.416 --> 46:46.166
The only thing you can do is hide
behind that damn speech. Boom, boom,<i> ciao.</i>

46:49.333 --> 46:50.250
Because you know.

46:51.666 --> 46:53.958
You've been left
in the lurch forever, friend.

47:05.375 --> 47:06.791
Let's get back to work.
