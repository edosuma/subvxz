17:21.082 --> 17:22.367
I'm just wondering,
it would be an honor

17:22.458 --> 17:25.246
if you would perhaps give me
a lesson one day or...

17:26.878 --> 17:28.118
You do not have a master?

17:29.090 --> 17:31.457
I belong to the kune
of Sifu Bruce Lee.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.635
Yes. I have heard
of Lee Jun-fan.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.711
Yeah?

17:37.557 --> 17:40.174
If you are a student
of Sifu Lee,

17:40.810 --> 17:43.848
I doubt there is anything
I can teach you.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.268
(DOOR BELL TINKLING)

17:54.615 --> 17:55.855
See you, man.
You prick.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.908
I finally meet a living legend
and I ask him to shine my shoes?

17:59.203 --> 18:00.989
(LAUGHS)
Could have been worse.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.161
Really? How?

18:02.248 --> 18:04.330
I could have taught you to say,
"I hear you have a tiny dick."

18:05.126 --> 18:07.288
BRUCE LEE: Hey, wait.
Watch your mouth in here.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.953
And what do you mean, you
finally met a living legend?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.412
You see me every day.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.872
(CHUCKLING)
I'm sorry, Sifu.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.674
I was talking
about Wong Jack Man.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.377
What the hell are you talking about?
Sifu, mouth!

18:17.471 --> 18:19.382
Shut up, Vinnie!
How did you meet him?

18:19.890 --> 18:21.472
I heard he was coming
to San Francisco.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.800
And I went to, you know,
meet him to shake his hand.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.343
Did he say
what he is doing here?

18:25.813 --> 18:27.053
He said
he came to observe.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.263
Observe what?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.899
He didn't say, Sifu, but he
did tell me he heard of you.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.195
So, the Shaolin sent Wong
Jack Man to spy on me.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.605
Why would
they do that?

18:38.784 --> 18:40.741
When I was a toadae of
Sifu Yip Man in Hong Kong.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.073
Shaolin found out
my Grandmother was white.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.871
You know what they did?
They made him stop teaching.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.959
So when I come to America, I
open up my kune for everybody.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.165
Maybe Shaolin
don't forgive me for that.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.043
You really think Master Wong
came because you teach whites?

18:55.926 --> 18:57.132
Why else
would he be here?

Just ignore him.
I can't, Frankie.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.881

in this world

who can tear down everything I've
been working so hard to build up.

Has he challenged you?

21:56.023 --> 21:57.013
Not yet.

So it doesn't
matter then.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.607
It does matter, Frankie.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.237

like the fact that I teach whites,

that I married one.

himself as a top dog here,

Kung Fu on television?

25:18.058 --> 25:19.514
For what purpose?

of the importance of Kung Fu.

the more people respect you?

Sifu Lee wants to see you.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.081
For what reason?

27:55.132 --> 27:58.090
He thinks you're here because he
teaches Kung Fu to Americans.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.467
What do you think,
Mr. McKee?

28:00.554 --> 28:02.511
Well, that would explain why
you don't want to teach me.

and thinking.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.188
It was born among
the Chinese people...

28:13.859 --> 28:15.816
and it belongs to
the Chinese people.

Do you share your
atomic bomb secrets?

28:20.490 --> 28:22.197
Well, Kung Fu
isn't an atomic bomb.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.274
No.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.075
It is more powerful.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.529
The bomb comes from
the death force.

28:28.749 --> 28:32.208
Kung Fu comes from chi,
the life force.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.127
Life is stronger than death.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.538
Master Wong,

28:38.550 --> 28:40.336
nothing about you
is what I expected.

28:40.427 --> 28:41.667
What did you expect?

28:41.845 --> 28:45.213
I guess, at the boat, I thought you'd
be greeted by a whole delegation.

28:45.307 --> 28:46.388
I am a monk.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.925
Not a television star.

28:50.687 --> 28:51.677
Thank you.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.517
But then I heard you were

Please.
Nah.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.485
Well, I'm just trying
to understand why...

29:04.785 --> 29:06.367
Why'd you come
to San Francisco?

29:08.330 --> 29:09.365

29:09.831 --> 29:12.198
That doesn't make any sense,
it's a terrible job.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.827
It is honest labor
and it is necessary.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.787
Yeah, but you're
a great Kung Fu master.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.125

is ashamed.

29:27.683 --> 29:28.673
Why?

29:31.144 --> 29:33.852
I allowed my pride
to overcome my discipline.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.309
I hurt someone badly,

29:36.984 --> 29:38.725
someone I respected.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.193
It is a great sin.

29:47.953 --> 29:50.536
Now, I must do penance.

29:51.915 --> 29:55.909
I must humble myself to restore
the balance in my soul.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.376
The balance
in your soul?

30:02.592 --> 30:05.550
Tell me, what does
Sifu Lee teach you?

30:07.556 --> 30:09.138
He teaches us
to kick ass.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.258
Kick ass?

30:18.900 --> 30:21.312
To take on a student
of such a man,

30:23.071 --> 30:25.187
that would be
a humbling experience.

30:25.907 --> 30:26.897
Please,

30:27.743 --> 30:29.074
let me think about it.

I tell Sifu Lee?

30:54.144 --> 30:55.134

I don't doubt that.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.198
So,

32:02.254 --> 32:03.744
you talked to Wong?
Yes.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.043
Did he say what
he's doing here?

32:08.051 --> 32:10.634
He said he's here to restore
the balance to his soul.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.886
How's he gonna do that?

32:15.016 --> 32:17.053

at the Jackson Café.

32:19.563 --> 32:22.601

35:37.344 --> 35:39.335
this is the famous
Wong Jack Man,

35:39.804 --> 35:41.511
master of the Shaolin temple.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.424
He's come all the way to San
Francisco to see what I can do.

35:46.728 --> 35:47.718
Well, Master Wong,

35:48.563 --> 35:49.598
are you satisfied?

35:50.607 --> 35:51.597
Yes.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.474
Thank you.

35:55.945 --> 35:57.936
Aren't you gonna share
some Shaolin wisdom with us?

36:04.537 --> 36:05.902
I have seen
what you can do.

36:06.748 --> 36:09.490
I have also seen
what you cannot do.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.374
What is that supposed to mean?

36:11.461 --> 36:12.792
Whatever you choose
it to mean.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.667
Don't give me your Shaolin
navel-gazing, say what you mean.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.629
Your technique
is impressive.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.511
Indeed,
it is almost perfect.

36:23.306 --> 36:26.048
But it has one limitation.

36:26.559 --> 36:27.549
Oh, really?

36:30.730 --> 36:31.720
What?

36:37.821 --> 36:38.811
You.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.397
You fight from ambition
and pride.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.700
But you do not fight
from your soul.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.867
And no matter how great
the skill you possess,

36:49.207 --> 36:50.993
nothing will make up
for that.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.121
You want to show me
what you mean.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.208
How do you suggest
I do that?

36:58.299 --> 36:59.289
Fight me.

37:00.009 --> 37:03.718
Right here and right now, so
everyone can see who has the limits.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.842
No. Thank you.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.308
That is not
why I came here.

37:09.394 --> 37:10.725
Then why did you come?

37:12.480 --> 37:15.438
Because your student
invited me.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.855
And now, with your
permission, I will leave.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.357
I told him to invite you.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.322

turn down a challenge

all these people.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.077

37:29.914 --> 37:33.999
You have made your limitation clear
in front of all these people.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.873
You don't settle things
with words, Wong,

37:41.760 --> 37:43.296

with your fists.

37:44.304 --> 37:45.465

past and you know it.

Why didn't you fight him?

pride, not to indulge it.

But you can't walk away
from a public challenge.

to fight and when it is not.

38:14.209 --> 38:15.199
And how...

when it's necessary?

your life for it.

to protect it.

Well, I bet a thousand bucks
on Sifu and I cleaned up.

01:25:17.904 --> 01:25:18.894
Who'd you bet on?

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:21.314
Master Wong.
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:23.983
I told you, never bet
against the street.

01:25:24.077 --> 01:25:25.112
Sifu.

01:25:25.912 --> 01:25:26.902
Take it easy, Mac.

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:28.616
I can imagine how you feel.

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:33.167
Actually I can't, I never
had my ass kicked before.

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:35.415
What is it like?
It hurts.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.500
But all the girls
were let go.

01:25:38.425 --> 01:25:39.961
Thank you,
both of you.

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:43.256
Hey, I took a grand off of my
Mom's bank account to bet on you,

01:25:43.347 --> 01:25:45.588
and I better put it back
before she finds out.

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:48.716
Glad you're not dead.

(SERENE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

01:25:54.608 --> 01:25:55.643
Do you need anything?

01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:58.267
No, I'm good.

01:26:00.697 --> 01:26:02.654
But I do have to ask.

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:06.442
Do you really think
you won that fight?

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:11.697
Yes.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:14.241
Why?

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:19.330
Wong showed me...

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:21.541
I had reached
a limit of my style.

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:23.964
I was only fighting myself.

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:27.304
He made me realize I had to
create a whole new style.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.590
You know how water

01:26:30.143 --> 01:26:31.804
takes the shape of anything
you put it in,

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.973
but it stays strong and pure?

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.555
Now that's gonna be my style.

01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:39.058
Cool.

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:42.145
I was planning
on being a star,

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:44.939
but I think I'd rather be
a legend instead.

01:26:47.577 --> 01:26:48.567
Like Wong Jack Man.

01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:54.247
Will you be back,
Master Wong?

01:26:55.502 --> 01:26:57.288
Yes, I think so.

01:26:58.588 --> 01:26:59.999
There's much
to learn here

01:27:00.507 --> 01:27:02.214
and perhaps
some to teach.

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:05.050
Will you still be here
when I return?

01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:06.502
Maybe.

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:09.054
I guess we'll have
to see how things go.

01:27:11.184 --> 01:27:12.174
Mr. McKee...

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:14.719
thank you.

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:16.721
Without you,

01:27:17.399 --> 01:27:19.982
I think I may never have
finished washing dishes.

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:25.195
Master \/Vong, Sifu Lee understood
what you wanted to teach him.

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:26.905
So you did win that fight.

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:32.324
Kung Fu must be given
to the world.

01:27:33.248 --> 01:27:34.579
Bruce Lee will do that.

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:36.957
And if he does not...

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:41.833
I may have to come back
and kick his ass again.
