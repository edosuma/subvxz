00:00.742 --> 00:02.414
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:02.416 --> 00:05.468
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

00:05.470 --> 00:08.270
Leonard. I must be losing my mind.

00:08.272 --> 00:10.473
The reason why Snart and I got on so well

00:10.475 --> 00:11.941
was we trusted one another.

00:11.943 --> 00:13.692
We were friends.

00:13.693 --> 00:16.361
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

00:16.364 --> 00:18.230
The spear could alter reality itself.

00:18.232 --> 00:19.565
We broke it into four separate pieces.

00:19.567 --> 00:21.450
Mr. Hunter took one...

00:21.452 --> 00:23.652
And took the rest of you to
three different time periods,

00:23.654 --> 00:25.070
which means the last piece unaccounted for

00:25.072 --> 00:26.572
must be with your grandfather.

00:26.574 --> 00:28.407
Waverider crew, we are now the proud owners

00:28.409 --> 00:30.576
of the last fragment
of the Spear of Destiny.

00:30.578 --> 00:32.912
Back in 1942, you have a
destiny waiting for you.

00:32.914 --> 00:34.630
Ask Ray what happens
to your village, ask him

00:34.632 --> 00:36.799
what happens to your daughter
and your granddaughter,

00:36.801 --> 00:40.219
and tell me you'll choose
history over your own family.

00:42.256 --> 00:43.255
Watch out, lads!

00:43.257 --> 00:44.757
- _
- Incoming!

00:49.147 --> 00:51.430
Coming through! Coming through!

00:51.432 --> 00:56.652
According to this map, Jesus'
blood is somewhere over there.

00:56.654 --> 00:58.487
The spear is sensing the blood.

00:58.489 --> 01:01.240
We won't last five minutes out there.

01:01.242 --> 01:02.942
It's not too late to use it.

01:11.536 --> 01:15.421
_

01:15.423 --> 01:17.790
It's hard to imagine that,
when joined with their siblings,

01:17.792 --> 01:19.959
they're as powerful as God.

01:19.961 --> 01:23.095
But right now, that's just
a useless piece of wood.

01:23.097 --> 01:24.597
It's not useless.

01:24.599 --> 01:26.932
I know ten different ways
to kill somebody with this.

01:26.934 --> 01:29.718
Not to mention,

01:29.720 --> 01:32.054
it's great for scratching in
those hard-to-reach places.

01:32.056 --> 01:33.973
Please don't tell me you
used the Spear of Destiny

01:33.975 --> 01:35.307
as a back scratcher.

01:35.309 --> 01:37.776
Who said anything about my back?

01:37.778 --> 01:39.812
Well, as Mr. Rory has demonstrated,

01:39.814 --> 01:41.063
in the wrong hands,

01:41.065 --> 01:43.148
this divine artifact can be

01:43.150 --> 01:45.367
- put to truly horrific use.
- Yeah.

01:45.369 --> 01:48.237
Which is why I called this meeting,

01:48.239 --> 01:52.324
to figure out how to keep
it out the Legion's hands.

01:52.326 --> 01:54.743
Where's Nate?

01:54.745 --> 01:58.998
Nathaniel said he wasn't
feeling up to socializing.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.833
He said he'll go along
with whatever we decide.

02:00.835 --> 02:02.635
What is there to decide?

02:02.637 --> 02:05.221
We find the Legion, and we steal
back their pieces of the spear.

02:05.223 --> 02:08.556
There's no need to find the Legion.

02:08.559 --> 02:10.476
I know where they've been operating out of.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.978
Why keep it a secret?
Let's just go get them.

02:12.980 --> 02:14.930
The reason why you've been
unable to locate Mr. Thawne

02:14.932 --> 02:16.932
and his partners all this
time is because they've

02:16.934 --> 02:19.852
- been operating outside of it.
- You lost me.

02:19.854 --> 02:21.520
- Yeah, me too.
- Three.

02:21.522 --> 02:24.690
What's the one place that
exists outside of time?

02:24.692 --> 02:26.825
- No way.
- Yes way.

02:26.827 --> 02:32.031
We must return to the Vanishing Point.

02:43.094 --> 02:44.460
We're in position. Ray?

02:44.462 --> 02:45.761
- Ready.
- Mick?

02:45.763 --> 02:47.880
- Yeah.
- Standby.

02:47.882 --> 02:50.099
Here.

02:50.101 --> 02:51.800
The pieces of the spear call to each other.

02:51.802 --> 02:53.886
We will be able to use
these to locate the pieces

02:53.888 --> 02:55.521
in the Legion's possession.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.723
That's why we're separating into two teams.

02:57.725 --> 03:00.859
Mr. Jackson, shall we?

03:00.861 --> 03:02.645
Are you sure bringing
out pieces of the spear

03:02.647 --> 03:04.730
was a good idea? If this goes wrong...

03:04.732 --> 03:06.982
Then the Legion has the entire spear.

03:06.984 --> 03:08.567
So we have to be careful.

03:13.457 --> 03:15.240
On my way for Legion-watching.

03:15.242 --> 03:16.825
20 seconds.

03:19.797 --> 03:22.498
Well, I thought I'd seen
the last of this place.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.583
Let's not make it a habit.

03:30.308 --> 03:32.057
Well, I appear to be getting considerable

03:32.059 --> 03:34.093
vibrational energy from this.

03:41.018 --> 03:44.520
My old friend, please, forgive me.

03:44.522 --> 03:46.071
Oof!

03:46.073 --> 03:48.991
Mick. Mick!

03:50.745 --> 03:52.361
Are you okay?

03:52.363 --> 03:55.280
Am I okay?

03:55.282 --> 04:00.252
Why wouldn't I be okay?

04:00.254 --> 04:02.621
I miss him too.

04:02.623 --> 04:08.427
He blew himself up. For what?

04:08.429 --> 04:11.180
So the rest of us could live.

04:11.182 --> 04:13.015
Idiot.

04:13.017 --> 04:15.134
Mick, we gotta go.

04:15.136 --> 04:17.019
Look, this is a heist.

04:17.021 --> 04:18.803
We have to steal the
other pieces of the spear

04:18.805 --> 04:21.724
and get out of here.

04:21.726 --> 04:23.609
You think this is what Snart wants?

04:23.611 --> 04:28.147
You waiting around so
that you can get caught?

04:28.149 --> 04:30.566
Probably not.

04:40.661 --> 04:42.244
Hold on a sec.

04:42.246 --> 04:44.380
That looks like something
you might hide something in.

04:47.885 --> 04:49.752
Yes, it does.

04:49.754 --> 04:52.304
Jax and I may have found the
other pieces of the spear.

04:52.306 --> 04:54.089
Standby.

04:54.091 --> 04:56.308
Copy that.

04:57.812 --> 04:59.895
And I've got eyes on Thawne.

05:03.517 --> 05:07.186
He doesn't know we're here.

05:12.526 --> 05:14.610
Your try, Mr. Jackson.

05:14.612 --> 05:17.496
Oh.

05:17.498 --> 05:19.031
What's your favorite candy?

05:19.033 --> 05:21.033
Jelly beans. Why?

05:35.766 --> 05:37.382
A little transmutation trick me and Grey

05:37.384 --> 05:39.101
have been working on.

05:46.193 --> 05:50.562
Both delicious and impressive, Mr. Jackson.

05:50.564 --> 05:51.730
We have the rest of the spear.

05:51.732 --> 05:52.981
Get back to the ship.

05:54.285 --> 05:55.901
We better hurry. He's on to us.

05:55.903 --> 05:57.369
- On my way.
- Everyone, get the hell

05:57.371 --> 05:59.371
- out of here.
- This can't be happening.

05:59.373 --> 06:01.573
They're not smart enough
for this to be happening.

06:01.575 --> 06:03.242
- You get it?
- Indeed.

06:03.244 --> 06:05.077
Gideon, get us out of here.

06:17.591 --> 06:20.592
No!

06:20.594 --> 06:22.177
Piece of cake.

06:22.179 --> 06:23.645
Whoa, you thought that was easy?

06:23.647 --> 06:25.981
No, I want a piece of cake and a beer.

06:25.983 --> 06:28.984
Later, where's the spear?

06:30.771 --> 06:35.190
There we go.

06:36.443 --> 06:37.743
What is that?

06:37.745 --> 06:39.361
That's power.

06:39.363 --> 06:41.246
The pieces of the spear
are calling to each other.

06:41.248 --> 06:43.782
They long to be whole.

06:47.705 --> 06:49.254
Yep, that just happened.

06:49.256 --> 06:50.455
Well, that's remarkable.

06:50.457 --> 06:52.124
The spear must be composed of some kind

06:52.126 --> 06:54.526
of magnetized compound which
acts as its own sealant.

06:54.528 --> 06:56.261
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.

06:56.263 --> 06:57.713
Don't touch it.

06:57.715 --> 06:59.882
Now that the spear is
whole, it will try and lure

06:59.884 --> 07:01.550
each of us to use it.

07:01.552 --> 07:06.722
It will draw on our weaknesses,
our desires, our regrets.

07:06.724 --> 07:09.892
It will promise each of us
that we can remake the world

07:09.894 --> 07:12.477
just as we want it.

07:12.479 --> 07:14.396
Well, what's wrong with that?

07:14.398 --> 07:16.148
What? Oh, come on.

07:16.150 --> 07:17.399
You're all thinking it.

07:17.401 --> 07:19.985
Absolute power corrupts, Mr. Rory.

07:19.987 --> 07:21.620
Even when used with the best intentions,

07:21.622 --> 07:24.323
which is why I'd attempted to destroy it.

07:24.325 --> 07:26.491
Well, maybe you didn't try hard enough.

07:26.493 --> 07:28.994
No, no, no, no, no!

07:28.996 --> 07:30.412
Not on the ship, bro!

07:30.414 --> 07:33.498
You said destroy, so I destroyed.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.751
It's not destroyed. It's not even charred.

07:35.753 --> 07:37.419
Any harm brought upon
the spear is temporary.

07:37.421 --> 07:39.087
It will always heal itself.

07:39.089 --> 07:41.173
That's why you had to
keep the pieces separated.

07:41.175 --> 07:44.476
Yes, accomplished with much
effort and numerous explosives.

07:44.478 --> 07:45.677
Wait a sec.

07:45.679 --> 07:48.180
There's something written on it.

07:48.182 --> 07:50.682
That's odd.

07:50.684 --> 07:52.351
That wasn't there before.

07:52.353 --> 07:54.519
It must have been revealed by the flames.

07:54.521 --> 07:57.105
Hmm, see, I did help.

07:57.107 --> 08:02.327
"Natum de sanguine, perditus a sanguine."

08:02.329 --> 08:04.529
Anyone know Latin?

08:05.950 --> 08:10.035
"Natum de sanguine, perditus a sanguine."

08:10.037 --> 08:12.454
Yes, but what does that mean?

08:12.456 --> 08:15.040
"Born of blood, undone by blood."

08:15.042 --> 08:16.592
And what does that mean?

08:16.594 --> 08:18.460
- It...
- Look, we finally

08:18.462 --> 08:19.928
have the spear.

08:19.930 --> 08:21.546
We just need to figure
out what to do with it.

08:21.548 --> 08:23.682
We need to determine a way to protect it.

08:23.684 --> 08:25.684
You don't.

08:25.686 --> 08:27.102
You destroy it.

08:27.104 --> 08:28.887
Yes, well, I've tried that, Dr. Heywood.

08:28.889 --> 08:30.272
It is impervious to destruction.

08:30.274 --> 08:33.058
No, it's not.

08:33.059 --> 08:36.395
"Born of blood, undone by blood."

08:36.397 --> 08:38.447
Pretend we're not historians.

08:38.448 --> 08:40.532
"Born of blood" because the blood of Christ

08:40.534 --> 08:41.783
gave the spear power.

08:41.784 --> 08:44.736
"Undone by blood" because
the blood of Christ

08:44.738 --> 08:46.538
is the only thing that can destroy it.

08:46.540 --> 08:48.740
Now you're talking.

08:48.742 --> 08:50.792
Gideon, plot a course for the Crucifixion.

08:50.794 --> 08:52.744
- Yes, Cap...
- Don't you dare, Gideon.

08:52.746 --> 08:55.747
Look, throughout history,
there are certain moments

08:55.749 --> 08:58.550
whose integrity are crucial.

08:58.552 --> 09:00.252
The birth, life, and death of Jesus Christ

09:00.254 --> 09:01.753
are all such moments.

09:01.755 --> 09:04.423
Any interference, no matter
how miniscule, could have

09:04.425 --> 09:06.892
disastrous consequences
for the time stream.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.478
We cannot go there. Ever.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.763
Look, I understand that,
but if this is the only way

09:11.765 --> 09:12.931
to destroy the spear...

09:12.933 --> 09:14.433
It's not.

09:16.270 --> 09:18.186
It's not the only way.

09:18.188 --> 09:21.073
Now, I'm not a historian,
but I can't imagine

09:21.075 --> 09:23.358
it's possible to obtain the blood of Christ

09:23.360 --> 09:25.110
without Christ.

09:25.112 --> 09:28.447
Actually, it is.

09:30.534 --> 09:34.202
I did a year abroad at Oxford
while working on my Masters,

09:34.204 --> 09:37.789
and in between dating this
girl, Wendy, I remember reading

09:37.791 --> 09:40.926
this unpublished paper
by this classics scholar

09:40.928 --> 09:42.461
from early 20th century.

09:42.463 --> 09:46.014
Now, this scholar had
this far-fetched theory

09:46.016 --> 09:48.350
about Sir Gawain, that the knight returned

09:48.352 --> 09:51.353
from the Crusades not with the Holy Grail,

09:51.355 --> 09:54.856
but with something far more valuable.

09:54.858 --> 09:56.942
- The blood of Christ.
- Exactly.

09:56.944 --> 09:59.945
Now, the paper went on to
theorize that Gawain had

09:59.947 --> 10:02.230
a vial of this precious substance on him

10:02.232 --> 10:04.232
up to his death and was buried with it

10:04.234 --> 10:06.985
somewhere in the North of France.

10:06.987 --> 10:08.870
Just somewhere in the North of France?

10:08.872 --> 10:10.205
That's a big area.

10:10.207 --> 10:12.124
I know, but if anyone, and I mean anyone,

10:12.126 --> 10:14.576
knows where to start looking,

10:14.578 --> 10:17.662
it's this guy.

10:17.664 --> 10:19.881
"The Burden of the Purest Heart:

10:19.883 --> 10:25.387
Sir Gawain's Secret
Treasure," written by...

10:25.389 --> 10:30.308
- John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.
- You're kidding.

10:30.310 --> 10:33.011
The guy who wrote "The Hobbit"
and "The Lord of the Rings."

10:33.013 --> 10:35.764
John Tolkien was in the
North of France in 1916

10:35.766 --> 10:37.766
during the Battle of the
Somme as a Second Lieutenant

10:37.768 --> 10:39.518
in World War I.

10:39.520 --> 10:43.021
Well, looks like we're going back to war.

10:49.781 --> 10:52.115
Temper, temper.

10:52.117 --> 10:53.817
Don't test me, Damien!

10:53.819 --> 10:55.485
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

10:55.487 --> 10:58.738
You sent me and Malcolm off
to find the Kalabros Manuscript

10:58.740 --> 11:00.207
while the Legends managed to abscond

11:00.209 --> 11:01.992
with the Spear of Destiny.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.743
I should have that zombie Speedster

11:03.745 --> 11:06.663
you're so afraid of eat your brain.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.331
No.

11:08.333 --> 11:11.885
No, this is actually
a positive development.

11:11.887 --> 11:13.753
Or maybe he already has.

11:13.755 --> 11:16.473
With the entire spear in
the Legends' possession,

11:16.475 --> 11:18.842
we no longer have to keep
going after it piecemeal.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.261
Yeah, I'm a glass half-full kind of guy...

11:21.263 --> 11:23.179
The legendary idiots
won't be able to use it.

11:23.181 --> 11:25.015
They'll either try to
hide it or destroy it,

11:25.017 --> 11:29.519
and when they do, we'll be there, waiting.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.571
- No.
- Excuse me?

11:31.573 --> 11:33.189
Not just us.

11:33.191 --> 11:35.408
I'm not sure if you're
keeping score, Eobard,

11:35.410 --> 11:36.776
but we're losing.

11:36.778 --> 11:40.196
So it's time to change the game.

11:47.539 --> 11:49.623
All right, we gotta be careful.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.875
The Battle of the Somme was
one of the bloodiest conflicts

11:51.877 --> 11:53.176
in human history.

11:53.178 --> 11:54.711
Sounds terrible. I'm in.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.296
We're all in.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.964
It's not gonna be easy
finding Tolkien in this mess.

11:57.966 --> 11:59.716
According to military records,

11:59.718 --> 12:02.135
Second Lieutenant Tolkien
contracted trench fever

12:02.137 --> 12:04.437
and was transferred to a
first aid outpost to await

12:04.439 --> 12:05.939
transportation back to Britain.

12:05.941 --> 12:08.558
Perfect. Amaya, take the Backstreet Boys,

12:08.560 --> 12:10.727
intercept Tolkien, find out what he knows,

12:10.729 --> 12:11.861
send him on his way.

12:11.863 --> 12:13.229
So what'd you want us to do?

12:13.231 --> 12:14.981
Guard the spear.

12:14.983 --> 12:17.067
Somebody has to be with
the spear at all times.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.235
Indeed, now that the spear
has been reconstituted,

12:19.237 --> 12:21.237
the stakes have never been greater.

12:21.239 --> 12:24.741
Which is why I should stay on the ship too.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.043
You okay?

12:27.045 --> 12:28.745
I'm fine.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.414
All right, in that case, go with the guys.

12:31.416 --> 12:34.167
They could use the adult supervision.

12:42.177 --> 12:46.479
We're at the outpost. God, it's a madhouse.

12:46.481 --> 12:47.647
Fan out to cover more ground.

12:47.649 --> 12:50.016
Stay on the coms and be careful.

12:50.018 --> 12:51.901
Yeah, Gideon said Tolkien was ill.

12:51.903 --> 12:54.237
We should search amongst the injured.

12:54.239 --> 12:58.441
Mr. Rory, Ms. Jiwe, you go look in triage.

12:58.443 --> 13:01.244
Let me guess. We get the fun part?

13:01.246 --> 13:03.246
I've always wanted to visit the Somme.

13:03.248 --> 13:07.117
Just without, you know,
all the warfare going on.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.420
Amaya, any sign of Tolkien?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.540
I... I don't know.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.292
There's so much suffering.

13:16.294 --> 13:18.845
So many injured.

13:24.936 --> 13:27.804
Miss, please, help me.

13:31.226 --> 13:33.610
Just try to stay still.

13:33.612 --> 13:35.528
Let me see what we're dealing with.

13:35.530 --> 13:37.781
Nurse, change these bandages, will you?

13:38.784 --> 13:42.235
I don't want to die alone.

13:42.237 --> 13:43.737
You won't.

13:48.326 --> 13:50.577
Here.

13:54.299 --> 13:57.250
Hey, those are for them.

14:22.694 --> 14:27.664
My, my, my, how the mighty have fallen.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.283
You said that the last time you appeared.

14:30.285 --> 14:32.836
Huh, you pick a hell of a time to show up.

14:32.838 --> 14:34.454
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.539
Yeah, in the middle of
being a good little doggie

14:36.541 --> 14:40.210
to those insufferable wannabes.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.512
Stay on mission, now.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.380
Gotta find this hobbit guy.

14:44.382 --> 14:46.599
J.R.R. Tolkien, why?

14:46.601 --> 14:47.884
Hoping for an autograph?

14:47.886 --> 14:49.552
I don't even know who that guy is.

14:49.554 --> 14:51.638
All I know is I gotta find
this hobbit guy who knows

14:51.640 --> 14:53.973
the guy who's buried with Jesus' blood.

14:53.975 --> 14:57.227
Then we can destroy the Spear of Destiny.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.396
Mick, Mick, Mick, when have
we ever destroyed anything

15:00.398 --> 15:03.533
we've ever stolen, let
alone the most valuable score

15:03.535 --> 15:04.534
in the universe?

15:04.536 --> 15:06.786
What have they done to you?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.573
How the hell are we supposed
to find anyone in here?

15:10.575 --> 15:12.075
- What?
- I said, how the hell

15:12.077 --> 15:13.543
are we sup...

15:13.545 --> 15:15.662
On your feet, you
lazy good-for-nothings,

15:15.664 --> 15:17.831
or I'll have you shot!

15:17.833 --> 15:19.833
Did you hear me, Lieutenant?

15:19.835 --> 15:23.052
- Yes, sir.
- On your feet with your weapon,

15:23.054 --> 15:25.755
you fool of a Tolkien! On your feet!

15:25.757 --> 15:28.808
Tolkien, Lieutenant Tolkien?

15:28.810 --> 15:31.060
Yes, yes, that's me.

15:31.062 --> 15:34.597
He's very ill. He's gotta come with us.

15:34.599 --> 15:36.983
Nonsense, I... I'm perfectly fine.

15:36.985 --> 15:38.985
- Whoa.
- Oh.

15:38.987 --> 15:41.070
This man is burning with a fever.

15:41.072 --> 15:42.405
We're taking him out of here now!

15:42.407 --> 15:44.073
Well, get him to the field hospital.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.861
Come on, you trench rats!

15:47.863 --> 15:50.280
The boys have a date
with your bitter steel!

15:50.282 --> 15:52.415
We have him, but he's
in no condition to talk.

15:52.417 --> 15:54.367
All right, get him to the extraction point.

15:54.369 --> 15:56.452
- We'll meet you there.
- Mr. Rory?

15:56.454 --> 15:58.171
Steal us an ambulance, will you?

15:58.173 --> 15:59.422
On it.

15:59.424 --> 16:00.957
What happened to the man who never

16:00.959 --> 16:03.459
took orders from anyone?

16:03.461 --> 16:05.461
I respected the hell out of that guy.

16:05.463 --> 16:08.131
Now you're just their trained pet.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.632
Sit, Mick. Fetch, Mick.

16:09.634 --> 16:11.935
Good boy, Mick. Woof!

16:11.937 --> 16:14.137
I'm no one's... pet.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.139
Sure you are.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.107
They may act all friendly to you,

16:18.109 --> 16:19.976
but they'll never trust you, never.

16:19.978 --> 16:21.611
When the chips are
down, they'll look at you

16:21.613 --> 16:26.616
the same way they always have: as a thug.

16:26.618 --> 16:30.320
But you and me? We're partners.

16:30.322 --> 16:34.073
At least, we were, and could be again.

16:34.075 --> 16:36.376
Take the Spear of Destiny,
Mick. Use it for yourself.

16:36.378 --> 16:38.161
- Use it for us.
- There is no us.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.913
- You're dead.
- I don't have to be, Mick.

16:39.915 --> 16:43.082
With the spear, it'd be
so easy to bring me back.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.502
You're in my head. You're a...

16:46.504 --> 16:48.471
you're an illumination.

16:48.473 --> 16:51.808
- A hallucination.
- That's it.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.097
Now, did that feel like a hallucination?

17:09.280 --> 17:11.238
I must be hallucinating.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.761
Actually, we took the liberty of curing

17:12.762 --> 17:15.276
your typhoid fever, Lieutenant Tolkien.

17:15.278 --> 17:16.656
You.

17:16.659 --> 17:18.787
I knew you weren't volunteers.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.873
Your accent alone was horrendous.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.508
I'll have you know I played Bert

17:22.510 --> 17:24.960
in my middle school production
of "Mary Poppins," thank you.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.546
Who are you, then? German?

17:27.548 --> 17:29.381
Ottoman? And where on God's Earth

17:29.383 --> 17:30.716
have you brought me?

17:30.718 --> 17:32.518
Somewhere the less
talked about, the better,

17:32.520 --> 17:34.186
- for your sake.
- But we're on your side,

17:34.188 --> 17:35.471
and we need your help.

17:35.473 --> 17:37.389
In your paper, "The Burden
of the Purest Heart,"

17:37.391 --> 17:40.192
you described the final
resting place of Sir Gawain.

17:40.194 --> 17:42.528
I never actually published
that paper... how did you...?

17:42.530 --> 17:44.229
It's hard to explain,
but we need to know where

17:44.231 --> 17:45.698
the knight is buried.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.399
You abducted me from the
middle of a battlefield

17:47.401 --> 17:49.034
to ask about an old myth?

17:49.036 --> 17:50.569
There is a war on, you fools!

17:50.571 --> 17:52.621
And I imagine that the
view from the trenches

17:52.623 --> 17:54.490
is pretty bleak.

17:54.492 --> 17:56.125
It looks to me like the end of the world.

17:56.127 --> 17:58.077
But it's not. Believe me,

17:58.079 --> 18:00.879
this darkness will pass.

18:00.881 --> 18:03.549
You speak as someone who's seen the future.

18:03.551 --> 18:05.751
Haven't all students of history?

18:05.753 --> 18:07.052
Those who suffer heal.

18:07.054 --> 18:09.054
Everything destroyed gets rebuilt.

18:09.056 --> 18:12.257
And our towers grow a
little taller every time.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.093
I should like to believe you.

18:14.095 --> 18:17.396
Tell me, why do you
seek the grave of Gawain?

18:17.398 --> 18:20.566
Eh... it's a long story.

18:20.568 --> 18:21.934
I enjoy long stories.

18:21.936 --> 18:24.369
Yeah, he does.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.938
In short, my fellow travelers and I...

18:25.940 --> 18:27.406
Fellowship, if you will.

18:27.408 --> 18:30.192
We're on a journey to destroy an object.

18:30.194 --> 18:33.979
One which would bring the
bearer unimaginable power.

18:33.981 --> 18:36.532
Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?

18:36.534 --> 18:40.702
I came across numerous obscure
references to it in my studies.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.421
Of course, such a divine artifact

18:42.423 --> 18:43.455
could never actually exist.

18:43.457 --> 18:44.923
But it does.

18:44.925 --> 18:48.177
And we need your help to end its threat.

18:48.179 --> 18:50.512
I left all my research at Oxford.

18:50.514 --> 18:53.766
To help you, I would need a vast library.

18:53.768 --> 18:56.718
Well, lucky for you, we brought one.

19:06.781 --> 19:08.730
How'd it go out there?

19:11.986 --> 19:13.152
Amaya?

19:15.072 --> 19:17.539
It was worse than any nightmare.

19:22.213 --> 19:24.830
You've seen this before.

19:24.832 --> 19:28.300
In World War II, it's definitely
a situation where the sequel

19:28.302 --> 19:30.302
was worse than the original.

19:30.304 --> 19:32.254
What changed?

19:32.256 --> 19:36.758
I had Gideon show me the historical record.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.645
My future.

19:39.647 --> 19:42.147
How much did you see?

19:42.149 --> 19:45.767
My village burned to the ground.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.820
My daughter turned into a refugee.

19:47.822 --> 19:52.157
And her daughter turned into an orphan.

19:52.159 --> 19:57.830
Seeing the battlefield today,
it just made it so real.

19:57.832 --> 20:00.115
I'm so sorry.

20:02.786 --> 20:08.507
But, if it helps, from
what my sister told me,

20:08.509 --> 20:11.710
despite all the pain and
suffering your granddaughter

20:11.712 --> 20:13.212
will endure...

20:15.216 --> 20:19.101
She turns out to be a
pretty remarkable person.

20:19.103 --> 20:20.302
A hero.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.903
Don't even think about it!

20:37.905 --> 20:41.123
That is not a scratcher of any variety.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.574
What happened to your face?

20:42.576 --> 20:44.576
I saw Snart again.

20:44.578 --> 20:47.412
More likely, you took a
nasty blow on the battlefield.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.249
Perhaps you're suffering
some minor brain damage or,

20:50.251 --> 20:52.251
at least, more brain damage.

20:52.253 --> 20:53.969
Snart did this!

20:53.971 --> 20:56.171
I believe you.

20:56.173 --> 20:57.890
- You do?
- Of course not.

20:57.892 --> 21:00.058
I just don't want you to hurt me.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.927
But, given our trip to the Vanishing Point,

21:01.929 --> 21:05.264
it would make sense that
he'd be in your thoughts.

21:05.266 --> 21:08.600
Mick, let him go.

21:08.602 --> 21:10.185
You're going to church.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.770
I'm not the religious type.

21:11.772 --> 21:13.772
Tolkien's located Gawain's burial place.

21:13.774 --> 21:15.607
It's in a cathedral in Amiens.

21:15.609 --> 21:16.909
If it's still there.

21:16.911 --> 21:19.244
The war's already passed through.

21:19.246 --> 21:20.529
Are you sure you're up for this?

21:20.531 --> 21:22.164
Yes.

21:22.166 --> 21:27.619
Snart, he... he's in my head, right?

21:34.261 --> 21:35.928
The Church of Amiens.

21:35.930 --> 21:38.547
Built in the 1600s, for centuries,

21:38.549 --> 21:40.716
it was a shelter, a refuge.

21:40.718 --> 21:43.602
Now just a place for
marauding armies to squat.

21:43.604 --> 21:45.354
Look closely, but be careful.

21:45.356 --> 21:47.105
Returning knights of
the Crusades were known

21:47.107 --> 21:49.858
to hide their relics so only
the worthy could find them.

21:49.860 --> 21:54.146
They set traps for those
who aren't so worthy.

21:54.148 --> 21:55.480
Aw, they're so close,

21:55.482 --> 21:57.649
finishing each others' dire warnings.

21:57.651 --> 22:00.202
- Ha.
- Think I found something.

22:03.157 --> 22:05.907
It's gotta be worth a fortune.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.960
- Gold.
- Yeah, don't bite the relics.

22:07.962 --> 22:10.495
- Give me that.
- And don't steal the relics.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.798
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

22:12.800 --> 22:14.666
the inscription's written in...

22:16.837 --> 22:19.671
Proto-Celtic.

22:19.673 --> 22:23.892
It says, "Follow the outlier,
then push further still."

22:23.894 --> 22:25.761
But what is the outlier?

22:31.602 --> 22:34.936
Three rubies, one emerald.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.855
I think I found our outlier.

22:36.857 --> 22:38.774
"Then push further still."

22:41.862 --> 22:44.780
This structure's been
damaged from all the fighting.

22:53.090 --> 22:55.707
Sir Gawain, I presume.

22:55.709 --> 22:58.927
Hey, look, on his
shield, it's an engraving.

22:58.929 --> 23:03.348
Pretty pathetic, if you ask me.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.387
Mr. Snart?

23:08.389 --> 23:11.773
Wait, you can see him?

23:11.775 --> 23:13.308
You're supposed to be dead.

23:13.310 --> 23:15.644
Yeah, they told me all about how I get soft

23:15.646 --> 23:19.231
and die for you losers.
I didn't believe them.

23:19.233 --> 23:20.699
Believe who?

23:20.701 --> 23:23.568
Well, if that's not an entrance line,

23:23.570 --> 23:25.570
I don't know what is.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.873
What is going on here?

23:27.875 --> 23:30.242
The Legion must have traveled back in time

23:30.244 --> 23:33.912
and picked up Mr. Snart
before he joined the Legends.

23:33.914 --> 23:35.747
He told us all about
your plan on how you're

23:35.749 --> 23:37.582
going to destroy the spear.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.418
Thanks for the tip, Mick.

23:41.255 --> 23:42.721
I didn't think he was real.

23:42.723 --> 23:45.340
No, no, no, no. No need to defend yourself.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.975
Actually, there is.

23:46.977 --> 23:48.060
Angriff!

23:49.730 --> 23:50.896
Get behind me!

23:53.484 --> 23:54.933
What is this madness?

23:56.236 --> 23:57.486
Aah!

23:57.488 --> 23:58.937
What are you?

24:00.441 --> 24:01.656
Aah!

24:06.947 --> 24:08.447
What are you doing? We gotta go!

24:08.449 --> 24:10.198
Not without the engraving!

24:16.840 --> 24:20.792
You actually care about these losers.

24:20.794 --> 24:23.345
Mick, come on, let's go!

24:23.347 --> 24:26.681
Because I guarantee they
don't care about you, Mick.

24:30.634 --> 24:32.483
So Snart's alive.

24:32.485 --> 24:34.126
And he's working with the Legion.

24:34.128 --> 24:36.103
Well, it's not just the Legion,

24:36.105 --> 24:37.321
is it, Mick?

24:37.323 --> 24:38.906
You got something to say to me?

24:38.908 --> 24:41.192
You told him about our
plan to destroy the spear.

24:41.194 --> 24:43.327
Well, I thought I was seeing things.

24:43.329 --> 24:45.746
Whether Mr. Snart was
a hallucination or not,

24:45.748 --> 24:48.533
the fact that you told him
about our plan speaks volumes.

24:48.535 --> 24:50.501
Volumes of what, Professor?

24:50.503 --> 24:53.504
I think what Martin is trying
to say is that he's worried

24:53.506 --> 24:55.039
that, if it came down to a decision

24:55.041 --> 24:56.374
between Leonard and us...

24:56.376 --> 24:58.543
You would choose Snart in a heartbeat.

24:58.545 --> 25:00.761
Yeah, I would. He's a friend,

25:00.763 --> 25:03.714
and you guys ain't exactly
being friendly right now.

25:03.716 --> 25:05.433
Can you blame us?

25:05.435 --> 25:08.553
We're concerned that your
blunder with Mr. Snart

25:08.555 --> 25:10.521
confirms that you haven't truly given up

25:10.523 --> 25:14.058
your roots as a... thug.

25:14.060 --> 25:16.527
Oh.

25:16.529 --> 25:19.730
That what you think, Captain?

25:19.732 --> 25:21.983
Mick, we just need you to be careful.

25:21.985 --> 25:23.150
Why?

25:26.239 --> 25:28.956
Oh, I see.

25:28.958 --> 25:32.660
In your eyes, I'm always
gonna be a... criminal.

25:35.715 --> 25:38.883
This is fascinating.

25:38.885 --> 25:42.887
Apparently the spear will glow
in the presence of divine blood.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.589
Yeah, and it also revealed
the message when Mick

25:44.591 --> 25:45.756
lit it on fire.

25:45.758 --> 25:47.508
A secret only fire can tell.

25:47.510 --> 25:49.427
How marvelous.

25:49.429 --> 25:51.062
So, unless you wanna wander all over France

25:51.064 --> 25:52.897
waiting for this thing
to light up, I suggest

25:52.899 --> 25:54.232
we figure out this map.

25:58.238 --> 25:59.570
You okay?

25:59.572 --> 26:00.605
I'm afraid I suffer from what is known

26:00.607 --> 26:03.357
in the trenches as "shell shock,"

26:03.359 --> 26:06.827
although some would prefer
to call it "common cowardice."

26:06.829 --> 26:09.413
Said the guy who dodged
bullets to get a grave rubbing.

26:09.415 --> 26:10.948
Give me a break.

26:10.950 --> 26:15.620
Proof I belong in a
library, and not on a...

26:15.622 --> 26:18.789
battlefield.

26:18.791 --> 26:21.626
I know where we have to
go to destroy the spear.

26:21.628 --> 26:23.961
Where?

26:23.963 --> 26:26.464
The middle of hell on Earth.

26:37.477 --> 26:39.560
You hear them too, huh?

26:39.562 --> 26:42.280
I'm sorry?

26:42.282 --> 26:44.398
The voices.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.817
What's the spear saying to you?

26:46.819 --> 26:49.537
It's not the spear. It's my mother.

26:49.539 --> 26:51.822
Her voice, at least.

26:51.824 --> 26:55.242
She's begging me to help our people.

26:55.244 --> 26:59.497
To keep our family and our legacy safe.

26:59.499 --> 27:02.249
She wants me to change my destiny.

27:02.251 --> 27:06.971
Maybe the spear can do that for her.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.839
The chance to rewrite reality.

27:08.841 --> 27:11.842
Who wouldn't be tempted?

27:11.844 --> 27:13.844
What do you hear?

27:15.848 --> 27:17.848
My parents.

27:17.850 --> 27:19.984
What are they saying?

27:19.986 --> 27:23.604
"Don't play with fire, Mick."

27:23.606 --> 27:26.857
Mick, Amaya, I need you in here.

27:29.954 --> 27:31.236
So, it looks like our historians

27:31.238 --> 27:32.988
have made a discovery.

27:32.990 --> 27:35.074
According to this map, the blood of Christ

27:35.076 --> 27:37.710
is hidden right smack in
the middle of no-man's land.

27:37.712 --> 27:39.828
Great, right at the center
of the bloodiest battle

27:39.830 --> 27:41.547
in human history.

27:41.549 --> 27:43.415
Even if we were to make it
through the terrain unscathed,

27:43.417 --> 27:45.718
there's still the issue of
the blood's precise location.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.302
That's the good news.

27:47.304 --> 27:50.672
Just as the spear acted as
a diving rod for its pieces,

27:50.674 --> 27:53.258
it glows when it's close to Jesus' blood.

27:53.260 --> 27:56.512
But one cannot simply walk
into the middle of a war zone.

27:56.514 --> 27:58.897
What if we convinced both
sides to stop fighting

27:58.899 --> 28:00.599
long enough for us to get in there?

28:00.601 --> 28:03.602
That'll never work.

28:03.604 --> 28:05.437
But there is another way.

28:05.439 --> 28:07.439
We can rewrite reality.

28:07.441 --> 28:08.941
Eliminate the threat of the Legion

28:08.943 --> 28:10.492
once and for all time.

28:10.494 --> 28:11.527
No, we can't.

28:11.529 --> 28:12.945
This is just a tool.

28:12.947 --> 28:14.530
In the right hands, in our hands,

28:14.532 --> 28:17.199
- we can use it for good.
- But the spear has more power

28:17.201 --> 28:19.284
than any of us could possibly wield.

28:19.286 --> 28:23.789
I know a thing or two about
wielding mystical artifacts.

28:23.791 --> 28:25.257
I can control it.

28:25.259 --> 28:26.759
Look, a totem is one thing,

28:26.761 --> 28:30.212
but that... that is more powerful

28:30.214 --> 28:32.631
than anything any of us have seen.

28:32.633 --> 28:34.183
She said she can handle it.

28:34.185 --> 28:35.968
Mick, not now.

28:35.970 --> 28:38.937
Amaya, look, you don't know
what the spear can do to you.

28:38.939 --> 28:42.024
Having the ability to
rewrite your own reality...

28:42.026 --> 28:44.610
it's too much temptation for anyone.

28:44.612 --> 28:48.230
That's why we have to do this the hard way.

28:49.950 --> 28:53.786
All right, hard way it is.

28:53.788 --> 28:55.988
I'm in.

28:55.990 --> 28:59.041
Yeah, I'm down.

28:59.043 --> 29:00.993
It's the right thing to do.

29:04.381 --> 29:06.999
Obviously, I've been outvoted.

29:07.001 --> 29:10.335
I will help you in whatever way I can.

29:10.337 --> 29:13.672
But I think you're making a huge mistake.

29:19.230 --> 29:20.846
Incoming!

29:20.848 --> 29:22.264
Aah!

29:25.269 --> 29:27.269
Coming through! Coming through!

29:27.271 --> 29:30.790
According to this map, Jesus' blood

29:30.792 --> 29:32.441
is somewhere over there.

29:32.443 --> 29:34.360
The spear is sensing the blood.

29:34.362 --> 29:37.113
We won't last five minutes out there.

29:37.115 --> 29:39.031
It's not too late to use it.

29:41.119 --> 29:42.418
Loser.

29:47.208 --> 29:50.459
Commander, we may request
a moment of your time.

29:50.461 --> 29:51.794
We are in the midst of battle.

29:51.796 --> 29:55.014
There are no moments... Lieutenant Tolkien.

29:55.016 --> 29:57.183
I was told you were
suffering from trench fever,

29:57.185 --> 29:59.769
and you better be, or else
I report you as a deserter.

29:59.771 --> 30:02.638
Captain Hunter, Royal Army Medical Corps.

30:02.640 --> 30:06.058
Now, I can assure you that
this man is no deserter.

30:06.060 --> 30:07.943
As such, we have an urgent entreaty.

30:07.945 --> 30:09.361
We need you to contact German command

30:09.363 --> 30:10.479
and request a ceasefire.

30:10.481 --> 30:12.064
How dare you waste my time?

30:12.066 --> 30:13.315
We're on the verge of taking Guillemont.

30:13.317 --> 30:14.733
Guillemont can wait.

30:14.735 --> 30:15.985
There is a greater battle at hand,

30:15.987 --> 30:18.070
one that concerns all of humanity.

30:18.072 --> 30:19.655
Both sides must lay down their arms,

30:19.657 --> 30:22.491
or all shall be lost.

30:22.493 --> 30:26.796
Sir, latest casualty report.

30:26.798 --> 30:28.831
2,300 dead.

30:28.833 --> 30:32.802
Nearly 8,000 wounded.

30:32.804 --> 30:35.971
All has already been lost.

30:38.976 --> 30:40.176
Mm.

30:42.847 --> 30:44.847
Perhaps our friends on the Germans' side

30:44.849 --> 30:47.483
are having more luck.

30:49.237 --> 30:51.320
You wish for me to order our artillery

30:51.322 --> 30:53.105
to stop shelling the enemy?

30:53.107 --> 30:55.157
Just long enough for
us to rescue the wounded

30:55.159 --> 30:56.442
from the battlefield.

30:56.444 --> 30:58.194
And so the British can rescue theirs.

31:02.366 --> 31:04.867
I will order our batteries to stop firing

31:04.869 --> 31:08.337
when they stop firing on us.

31:08.339 --> 31:11.173
It seems neither side
wants to give up the fight.

31:11.175 --> 31:13.342
We don't have time, not
with the Legion on our tails.

31:13.344 --> 31:14.293
We have to push forward.

31:14.295 --> 31:16.178
Advance, soldiers!

31:16.180 --> 31:19.215
Up the ladders, over the top, let's go!

31:21.052 --> 31:22.718
The British are advancing.

31:22.720 --> 31:25.020
Now's our best chance to move.

31:25.022 --> 31:26.889
It's all on us now.

31:26.891 --> 31:29.608
Watch each others' backs, and
we'll make it to the ship alive.

31:29.610 --> 31:31.393
Understood?

31:52.917 --> 31:54.416
Oh!

31:59.390 --> 32:00.839
We're getting closer!

32:03.261 --> 32:06.478
What is it with me and Nazis?

32:06.480 --> 32:08.013
Wrong World War, Mick!

32:08.015 --> 32:09.598
These are Huns, not Nazis!

32:09.600 --> 32:12.151
I don't care what you wanna call them,

32:12.153 --> 32:14.320
just take them out, now!

32:14.322 --> 32:15.771
I'm on it.

32:32.089 --> 32:33.789
_

32:36.043 --> 32:37.793
We must be almost on top of it.

32:37.795 --> 32:39.378
That way.

32:39.380 --> 32:41.597
Sir, you need to understand
that this is one problem

32:41.599 --> 32:43.599
that cannot be solved with violence.

32:45.353 --> 32:47.219
Okay, maybe a spot of violence.

32:47.221 --> 32:49.555
Well, if he's not gonna give
the order for the ceasefire,

32:49.557 --> 32:50.940
we'll have to.

32:50.942 --> 32:52.524
What frequency are we on?

32:52.526 --> 32:54.560
Um, three megahertz.

32:54.562 --> 32:57.029
Jax, set the Waverider
to receive the signal

32:57.031 --> 33:01.150
and hijack all communication
on the battlefield.

33:01.152 --> 33:02.985
Copy that, pumping the volume.

33:08.209 --> 33:10.409
Attention all combatants.

33:10.411 --> 33:13.329
May I have your attention, please?

33:14.882 --> 33:18.050
There are casualties on the battlefield.

33:20.838 --> 33:23.839
Brave men on both sides
who are in urgent need

33:23.841 --> 33:26.342
of medical attention.

33:26.344 --> 33:29.728
I know that the divisions
between us run deep,

33:29.730 --> 33:33.182
that they may very well be insurmountable.

33:33.184 --> 33:36.568
But I implore both of our armies

33:36.570 --> 33:39.772
for this one moment

33:39.774 --> 33:43.609
to come together as allies
and honor a ceasefire

33:43.611 --> 33:45.444
so that the injured may be removed

33:45.446 --> 33:48.113
from the field of battle.

33:48.115 --> 33:53.419
There may come a day
when our courage fails us,

33:53.421 --> 33:56.171
when we forsake our friendships

33:56.173 --> 33:58.957
and break the bonds of fellowship,

33:58.959 --> 34:03.045
but today is not that day.

34:03.047 --> 34:06.215
And perhaps in showing our humanity...

34:09.353 --> 34:11.469
We might just save it.

34:26.987 --> 34:29.321
It worked.

34:29.322 --> 34:32.241
I can't believe they fell for it.

34:32.243 --> 34:33.992
Let's keep moving.

34:36.996 --> 34:38.914
That's gotta be it.

34:59.570 --> 35:02.688
Tolkien was right.

35:02.690 --> 35:04.189
The legend's real.

35:04.191 --> 35:05.407
It's the blood of...

35:05.409 --> 35:08.610
Christ, you are so predictable.

35:08.612 --> 35:11.113
Though, I have to admit,
negotiating a ceasefire

35:11.115 --> 35:13.699
in the middle of a World
War? Pretty impressive.

35:13.701 --> 35:16.452
Maybe they'd like to hear our peace terms.

35:16.454 --> 35:18.203
It's quite simple, really.

35:18.205 --> 35:21.673
Hand over the spear, or we kill you.

35:29.547 --> 35:30.763
Sorry, Captain,

35:30.765 --> 35:33.441
but you've reached the end of your quest.

35:33.443 --> 35:35.827
You're right. I'm gonna end this now.

35:35.829 --> 35:39.781
Mick, give me the spear.

35:39.783 --> 35:40.782
Mick.

35:40.784 --> 35:41.906
What are you doing?

35:41.908 --> 35:44.452
Hey, man, we're your friends.

35:44.454 --> 35:45.787
I don't have friends.

35:45.789 --> 35:49.457
But he does have partners.

35:49.459 --> 35:52.844
So what do you say, partner?

35:52.846 --> 35:55.346
Mick, you're better than this.

35:55.348 --> 35:57.098
No, actually, you're not.

35:57.100 --> 36:00.468
They may pretend to believe in
you as long as they can use you,

36:00.470 --> 36:02.603
but they'll just as soon let you die,

36:02.605 --> 36:04.272
same as they did me.

36:04.274 --> 36:06.641
He's messing with your head, man.

36:06.643 --> 36:08.109
Ever since I've been on that ship,

36:08.111 --> 36:09.644
you people have been trying to change me.

36:09.646 --> 36:11.779
That's not true, Mick.

36:11.781 --> 36:13.314
But guess what?

36:13.316 --> 36:16.451
There are things about
me I wanna change too.

36:18.405 --> 36:20.038
Steel up, Nate. Stop him.

36:20.040 --> 36:22.156
He does, you and animal chick die,

36:22.158 --> 36:23.741
but we still keep the spear.

36:23.743 --> 36:27.161
And we're gonna make
all kinds of fun changes.

36:27.163 --> 36:28.713
You bastard.

36:28.715 --> 36:31.799
Come with me.

36:31.801 --> 36:35.086
The spear can help us
fix your messed up future

36:35.088 --> 36:37.171
and my past.

36:39.342 --> 36:41.592
Never.

36:41.594 --> 36:43.344
If you think we're gonna
let you walk out of here

36:43.346 --> 36:44.645
- with the spear...
- You're right.

36:44.647 --> 36:46.147
You know, we could use a distraction.

36:46.149 --> 36:50.518
I hereby declare that
the armistice is over.

36:55.108 --> 36:56.190
Get down!

37:01.748 --> 37:03.081
Oh, that's just great.

37:03.083 --> 37:04.749
Now we're all gonna die.

37:04.751 --> 37:09.420
Mick, have I ever pulled a
heist without a getaway plan?

37:16.679 --> 37:18.679
I wish things could've
been different, Sara.

37:20.767 --> 37:22.550
Get down!

37:22.552 --> 37:24.218
Jax, we need an extraction.

37:24.220 --> 37:26.220
Go!

37:26.222 --> 37:27.805
Copy that, I'm in bound.

37:36.232 --> 37:37.615
Aah!

37:43.156 --> 37:44.288
Ah.

38:02.642 --> 38:04.976
Okay, opening the cargo bay doors.

38:08.097 --> 38:09.597
Let's go!

38:12.819 --> 38:14.101
Amaya!

38:16.439 --> 38:18.322
Mick's gone. It's over.

38:27.450 --> 38:30.618
We never should have set
foot on that battlefield.

38:30.620 --> 38:32.703
We didn't have a choice.

38:32.705 --> 38:34.288
That's not true.

38:34.290 --> 38:37.008
There was a choice, and
you made the wrong one,

38:37.010 --> 38:39.877
and now the Spear of Destiny,
the most powerful weapon

38:39.879 --> 38:42.597
in all of history, is
in the hands of not one,

38:42.599 --> 38:44.298
but four psychopaths.

38:44.300 --> 38:47.301
- Don't forget Mr. Rory.
- That's right.

38:47.303 --> 38:50.221
We trusted him, and he screwed us over.

38:50.223 --> 38:52.857
Did we trust him?

38:52.859 --> 38:55.943
I mean, admit it, we never really did,

38:55.945 --> 38:57.528
and he picked up on it.

38:57.530 --> 39:02.283
Yeah, apparently Mr.
Rory's not entirely stupid.

39:02.285 --> 39:04.652
We lied to him.

39:04.654 --> 39:05.653
Not Mick, Tolkien.

39:05.655 --> 39:08.656
We told him there was hope.

39:08.658 --> 39:11.993
That humanity will light its way, but...

39:11.995 --> 39:15.830
we just ended up dumping
him back in the trenches.

39:15.832 --> 39:17.915
We had to restore time.

39:17.917 --> 39:19.584
Although I suppose it
doesn't really much matter

39:19.586 --> 39:21.636
now that reality itself is threatened.

39:25.508 --> 39:27.225
Maybe not.

39:30.063 --> 39:32.513
Last time I checked, there
was not an on/off button

39:32.515 --> 39:35.850
on the spear.

39:35.852 --> 39:39.854
What if... what if they
don't know how to use it?

39:39.856 --> 39:41.022
Oh.

39:41.024 --> 39:44.575
I have to say, well done.

39:44.577 --> 39:46.777
I've heard of your
skills as a thief before,

39:46.779 --> 39:50.164
but this has taken it to a whole new level.

39:50.166 --> 39:54.001
Truly masterful, getting one
of them to steal it for us.

39:54.003 --> 39:55.953
He was never really one of them.

39:55.955 --> 39:58.456
Were you, Mick?

39:58.458 --> 40:00.875
I thought you said the
spear belonged to us.

40:00.877 --> 40:03.010
There's plenty of power to go around.

40:03.012 --> 40:05.129
Thanks for waiting for me.

40:05.131 --> 40:07.214
Seems like I missed a few things.

40:07.216 --> 40:08.299
You found the Kalabros.

40:08.301 --> 40:10.551
The word of God himself.

40:10.553 --> 40:13.554
It's like the owner's manual
for the Spear of Destiny.

40:13.556 --> 40:15.306
It wasn't easy to find.

40:15.308 --> 40:17.141
Now what?

40:20.947 --> 40:22.813
Grab hold.

40:32.659 --> 40:35.409
"B'khi-eel.

40:35.411 --> 40:39.580
"Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.
K'i-ah-een.

40:39.582 --> 40:42.049
"Kh-det Bay-all-ma-ah.
B'khi-eel.

40:42.051 --> 40:44.418
"Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.
K'i-ah-een.

40:44.420 --> 40:46.921
"Kh-det Bay-all-ma-ah.
B'khi-eel.

40:46.923 --> 40:49.223
"Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.
K'i-ah-een.

40:49.225 --> 40:51.092
"Kh-det Bay-all-ma-ah.
B'khi-eel.

40:51.094 --> 40:53.060
"Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.
K'i-ah-een.

40:53.062 --> 40:54.762
Kh-det
Bay-all-ma-ah."
