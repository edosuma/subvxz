WEBVTT

00:00.805 --> 00:02.706
<i>There are a few
things you might need to know.</i>

00:02.774 --> 00:04.308
Don't hurt him again.
- I won't.

00:04.376 --> 00:06.007
The hotel's booked,
so we should probably

00:06.144 --> 00:07.378
go if we're gonna beat traffic.

00:07.445 --> 00:08.479
With this list,
it's just a matter of time

00:08.547 --> 00:10.080
before we learn the identities

00:10.148 --> 00:11.015
of FULCRUM's agents.

00:18.590 --> 00:20.991
Oh, wow!

00:21.059 --> 00:22.293
Chuck, look at this view!

00:22.360 --> 00:24.161
It's amazing.

00:26.031 --> 00:27.832
Chuck? It's just
a Ferris wheel.

00:27.899 --> 00:29.200
It's fine.

00:29.267 --> 00:30.734
Ah. Yeah.

00:30.802 --> 00:33.504
Yeah, it's not the...
it's not the wheel so much

00:33.572 --> 00:34.939
as it is me.

00:35.006 --> 00:37.575
What? What does
that mean?

00:39.544 --> 00:41.545
I kind of sort of
bribed the carny

00:41.613 --> 00:44.048
to stop us at the top.

00:44.115 --> 00:45.983
Well, for someone
who's afraid of heights,

00:46.051 --> 00:47.751
that was
pretty moronic.

00:47.819 --> 00:50.754
I was going for... romantic,

00:50.822 --> 00:52.523
but...

00:52.591 --> 00:54.258
Okay, here goes. Uh...

00:54.326 --> 00:57.161
Jill, we... we've been friends

00:57.229 --> 00:59.263
for... for, like,
a semester now, right?

00:59.331 --> 01:01.198
And it's been really fun.

01:01.266 --> 01:03.567
And I was just...

01:03.635 --> 01:04.802
I was thinking that maybe,

01:04.870 --> 01:06.437
you know, uh,
you and I... we could,

01:06.505 --> 01:10.074
I don't know...

01:10.142 --> 01:11.642
You know what? You're right.

01:11.710 --> 01:12.977
I-I... What am I thinking?

01:13.044 --> 01:14.712
You're right.
This is moronic. I...

01:14.779 --> 01:16.680
You were happy being friends,
and I'm happy being friends,

01:16.748 --> 01:17.948
and I just thought...

01:18.016 --> 01:19.450
Chuck, there <i>is</i> a problem.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.320
You talk way, way

01:23.388 --> 01:25.422
too much.

01:27.726 --> 01:29.560
<i>Jill Roberts is FULCRUM?</i>

01:29.628 --> 01:31.162
And she has Chuck?

01:31.229 --> 01:33.063
How is that possible?

01:33.131 --> 01:35.366
Well, the LaFleur List
contained a code name

01:35.433 --> 01:37.735
our computer translated
to one Jill Roberts.

01:37.802 --> 01:40.404
By the time we saw it,
they were already gone.

01:40.472 --> 01:41.605
His cell is switched off,

01:41.673 --> 01:42.673
and his watch is still
in the apartment.

01:42.741 --> 01:43.841
Find him.

01:43.909 --> 01:45.009
I don't care how. Just do it.

01:47.078 --> 01:48.412
You know, it doesn't matter.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.847
FULCRUM's working him over
about now.

01:49.915 --> 01:51.348
He's not gonna last an hour.

01:51.416 --> 01:52.550
No, you're wrong.

01:52.617 --> 01:54.018
They don't know
Chuck's the Intersect,

01:54.085 --> 01:56.554
and they don't know
Jill has been burned.

01:56.621 --> 02:01.058
Well, if it ain't torture...
what are they doing to him?

02:01.126 --> 02:04.962
We have ways to
make you talk, Mr. Bartowski.

02:05.030 --> 02:06.897
Do your worst.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:15.774 --> 02:17.641
There's gonna be yelling.

02:17.709 --> 02:19.543
Well, was it worth it?

02:22.581 --> 02:24.682
Was it worth it?

02:27.853 --> 02:29.720
Mmm.

02:31.356 --> 02:32.590
It was so worth it.

02:34.793 --> 02:36.293
Good.

02:36.361 --> 02:37.862
I'm going to take a shower.

02:37.929 --> 02:39.463
You deal with the yelling, okay?

02:39.531 --> 02:40.731
Okay.

02:41.933 --> 02:43.801
Have fun.

02:57.983 --> 02:59.817
Oh, that's not good.

03:05.790 --> 03:07.825
Jill, your phone's buzzing.

03:07.893 --> 03:09.293
What?

03:09.361 --> 03:13.063
Oh, no. No, no, no, no!

03:20.472 --> 03:22.206
This can't be happening.

03:22.274 --> 03:23.507
What was that, Chuck?

03:23.575 --> 03:24.675
Nothing!

03:24.743 --> 03:26.677
Um, nothing at all, actually.

03:26.745 --> 03:28.445
I was just saying,
I'm a little...

03:28.513 --> 03:30.514
I'm a little, uh, parched,
'cause-cause,

03:30.582 --> 03:32.550
well, last night was incredible.

03:32.617 --> 03:35.186
You know? Like,
we had some fun, didn't we?

03:35.253 --> 03:37.488
Then I was thinking,
hey, you want some coffee?

03:37.556 --> 03:38.556
Yeah, that'd
be great.

03:38.623 --> 03:40.457
Okay, great, great.

03:49.201 --> 03:50.968
Oh!

03:51.036 --> 03:53.003
You idiot!

03:53.071 --> 03:54.638
You sad-sack,
bleeding heart idiot!

03:54.706 --> 03:55.873
She's-She's...

03:55.941 --> 03:57.608
Chuck, never do that again.

03:57.676 --> 03:59.009
It's Jill. I think....

03:59.077 --> 03:59.710
We know.
- We know.

03:59.778 --> 04:00.978
Wait.

04:01.046 --> 04:03.914
This-This has got
to be a mistake, okay?

04:03.982 --> 04:06.016
I've known Jill
for eight years, since college,

04:06.084 --> 04:07.418
and we-we had
this really amazing...

04:08.587 --> 04:10.221
...night. Look, she's not a spy,

04:10.288 --> 04:12.056
and she has
no FULCRUM code name.

04:12.123 --> 04:13.524
The code name was...
Wait, wait, wait.

04:13.592 --> 04:14.391
Don't say it.

04:14.459 --> 04:15.993
Sandstorm.

04:18.964 --> 04:20.798
Oh, my God.

04:22.132 --> 04:24.068
Jill's a spy.

04:24.135 --> 04:25.669
I'm sorry, Chuck.

04:31.843 --> 04:33.677
<i>What do you mean</i>

04:33.745 --> 04:35.312
I have to go back in there?

04:35.380 --> 04:37.114
Think, Bartowski. We
don't want Jill to know

04:37.182 --> 04:38.849
that we know
she's a spy, right?

04:38.917 --> 04:40.017
Oh, okay, look, okay.

04:40.085 --> 04:41.519
Jill is FULCRUM.

04:41.586 --> 04:43.521
FULCRUM is looking
for the Intersect,

04:43.588 --> 04:45.890
and the Intersect just happens
to be <i>me.</i>

04:45.957 --> 04:47.158
Chuck, they don't know that.

04:47.225 --> 04:48.526
Trust me. We're right here.

04:48.593 --> 04:50.227
Everything will be fine.
You will be safe.

04:50.295 --> 04:51.595
Yeah. Buck up,
soldier.

04:51.663 --> 04:52.963
FULCRUM pulled one
on us.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.832
Let's return the favor.

05:06.344 --> 05:08.145
Oh!

05:08.213 --> 05:10.481
Thank you, sweetie.

05:10.549 --> 05:12.917
Oh...

05:14.753 --> 05:16.253
You're welcome... darling.

05:43.014 --> 05:44.482
# Na-na na-na na-na #

05:44.549 --> 05:47.418
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

05:47.486 --> 05:49.019
# Na-na na-na na-na #

05:49.087 --> 05:50.688
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

05:50.755 --> 05:52.223
# Na-na na-na na-na #

05:52.290 --> 05:55.526
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

06:05.392 --> 06:06.792
<i>Chuck, are you sure</i>
<i>everything's okay?</i>

06:06.860 --> 06:08.861
Huh? Yeah. Everything's
fantastic. It's great.

06:08.928 --> 06:11.563
This is me on the verge
of total happiness.

06:11.631 --> 06:13.632
Okay, do you want to do
something tonight?

06:13.700 --> 06:16.335
Um, yeah, I would...
I would love to,

06:16.403 --> 06:18.837
but the problem is,
the apartment is not safe.

06:18.905 --> 06:20.172
My sister's back,

06:20.240 --> 06:22.107
and I can't blow my cover, so...

06:22.175 --> 06:23.842
Well, we can go out.

06:23.910 --> 06:26.612
Okay. All right.

06:30.016 --> 06:31.016
Okay.

06:31.084 --> 06:32.918
Bye. Drive safe.

06:41.328 --> 06:42.962
Are you okay?

06:43.029 --> 06:44.296
You know, for a few days,

06:44.364 --> 06:45.864
I thought things were going
to be different.

06:45.932 --> 06:47.800
I could have a life.
I could have a girlfriend.

06:47.867 --> 06:49.068
I could be
a regular human being.

06:49.135 --> 06:50.269
I thought Jill was...

06:50.337 --> 06:52.171
Different?
- No.

06:52.238 --> 06:53.639
Normal.

06:53.707 --> 06:54.673
How could
this happen?

06:54.741 --> 06:56.041
Jill must have been recruited

06:56.109 --> 06:57.910
when she was at Stanford.

06:57.978 --> 07:00.512
FULCRUM uses leadership seminars
to look for possible agents.

07:00.580 --> 07:03.849
Excuse me, I'm sorry, General,
but who in my life isn't a spy?

07:03.917 --> 07:05.351
My sister? My best friend?

07:05.418 --> 07:06.552
Should I just start
asking people that

07:06.619 --> 07:07.853
when I first meet them?

07:07.921 --> 07:09.488
Hi. I'd like
the extra value meal,

07:09.556 --> 07:11.790
and while we're on the topic,
do you covertly work

07:11.858 --> 07:12.858
for a government espionage
faction?

07:12.926 --> 07:14.927
Your flash in Jill's room

07:14.995 --> 07:16.629
referenced an agent
called Leader.

07:16.696 --> 07:19.031
We want you to use
your relationship with Jill,

07:19.099 --> 07:20.566
see if she makes contact
with him.

07:20.634 --> 07:21.867
General, Chuck is not ready

07:21.935 --> 07:23.102
for this type of mission.

07:23.169 --> 07:24.703
He could barely handle
a good-bye with Jill.

07:24.771 --> 07:26.105
She's going to see
right through him.

07:26.172 --> 07:27.973
This is our best opportunity
to infiltrate FULCRUM,

07:28.041 --> 07:29.541
but if you don't think
he's ready...

07:29.609 --> 07:30.776
I'll do it.

07:32.812 --> 07:35.781
Jill betrayed me twice.

07:35.849 --> 07:38.484
You bet I'll do it.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.361
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't sit down!

07:49.429 --> 07:52.464
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What is it?

07:52.532 --> 07:54.233
Devon's parents are coming
tomorrow for Thanksgiving,

07:54.301 --> 07:55.834
and the couch is... perfect.

07:55.902 --> 07:57.603
Okay, perfect.
- The Awesomes?

07:57.671 --> 07:59.038
The Awesomes are coming here?

07:59.105 --> 08:01.073
Yes, the Very Awesomes
are coming here.

08:01.141 --> 08:03.642
They make their son
look mildly impressive.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.411
Sis, you got nothing
to worry about.

08:05.478 --> 08:06.912
They love you.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.614
Huh. I guess
when you're a doctor,

08:08.682 --> 08:10.049
and you marry a doctor,

08:10.116 --> 08:11.684
and you raise
three awesome boys,

08:11.751 --> 08:13.786
you tend to judge people
a little harsher.

08:13.853 --> 08:16.455
I guess that's how I feel
when Mrs. Awesome is around.

08:16.523 --> 08:19.291
I have never heard you use
the nickname that many times.

08:19.359 --> 08:21.093
I know. I know. It's okay.

08:21.161 --> 08:23.162
I'm just a little
stressed right now,

08:23.229 --> 08:24.997
but we all have
our burdens to bear.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.268
Hey, Chuck, yo!

08:29.336 --> 08:30.936
Hey, yo!

08:31.004 --> 08:32.770
What?

08:32.839 --> 08:33.938
Anybody here?

08:34.006 --> 08:35.073
Like whom?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.342
Like whom?

08:36.409 --> 08:38.010
Like, the other
woman, dude. Jill.

08:38.078 --> 08:39.544
Morgan, there is
no other woman.

08:39.611 --> 08:40.813
Really? That's great,

08:40.880 --> 08:43.182
'cause I thought I
was gonna have to do

08:43.249 --> 08:44.583
some sort of intervention
or something.

08:44.651 --> 08:46.185
You know, help you
with your addiction

08:46.252 --> 08:47.553
to really
attractive women.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.455
What's that smell?

08:49.522 --> 08:51.023
Uh, probably Ellie.

08:51.091 --> 08:52.725
She's doing some
practice cooking for tomorrow.

08:52.792 --> 08:54.193
Naturally.
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.728
So, that smell is...

08:55.795 --> 08:57.663
turkey.

09:13.179 --> 09:16.649
Morgan?

09:16.716 --> 09:17.850
Morgan?!

09:19.185 --> 09:20.152
I need you to try this.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.121
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

09:22.188 --> 09:23.389
Oh, my God.

09:28.061 --> 09:29.862
It's heaven.

09:29.929 --> 09:32.031
No. No, it's too...
it's too dry.

09:34.701 --> 09:36.835
Test turkey #1 is too dry.

09:36.903 --> 09:39.271
Uh, three hours, seven minutes.

09:42.008 --> 09:43.175
What are you doing?

09:43.243 --> 09:44.977
No, no, no, no. Ellie,
what are you...?

09:45.045 --> 09:46.211
Oh, my God.

09:46.279 --> 09:49.782
Okay, Morgan, we need to talk.

09:49.849 --> 09:52.751
It's fine. Please just don't
hurt another turkey like that.

09:52.819 --> 09:54.353
Morgan, this Thanksgiving
is very important.

09:54.421 --> 09:55.721
Sure.

09:55.789 --> 09:57.222
And things need
to run smoothly.

09:57.290 --> 09:59.491
I know. I know.

09:59.559 --> 10:00.759
You've been so stressed.
Everything's great.

10:00.827 --> 10:02.061
It's perfect. What can I do?

10:02.128 --> 10:03.329
Morgan?

10:03.396 --> 10:04.697
Yeah?

10:04.764 --> 10:06.598
You're...

10:06.666 --> 10:07.766
Not invited!

10:07.834 --> 10:09.034
I can't believe this.

10:09.102 --> 10:11.170
I mean, how?
Uninvited to T-day...

10:11.237 --> 10:12.438
Morgan, Morgan, relax.

10:12.505 --> 10:14.673
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you.

10:14.741 --> 10:16.208
It's all going to be okay.

10:16.276 --> 10:18.477
I'm gonna talk to Ellie,
and we're gonna sort it out.

10:18.545 --> 10:20.646
Anna's out of town,
and you guys were my only hope.

10:20.714 --> 10:22.514
If I don't Thanksgiving with you...
Morgan! Morgan, breathe.

10:22.582 --> 10:24.383
Excuse me, sir?
- Hi. Can I help you?

10:24.451 --> 10:25.617
Grimes! With me.

10:25.685 --> 10:27.987
Okay.

10:28.054 --> 10:29.922
Did I just hear you don't
have Thanksgiving plans?

10:29.990 --> 10:31.457
That's terrible,
damn terrible.

10:31.524 --> 10:33.459
I'm amazed to find
so many staff members

10:33.526 --> 10:35.327
without proper plans
for Thanksgiving.

10:35.395 --> 10:37.496
Like these two
poor creatures.

10:37.564 --> 10:38.764
Sir, are you inviting us
to dinner?

10:38.832 --> 10:40.966
No... God, no.

10:41.034 --> 10:43.936
I need you lonely bastards
to stand guard here at the store

10:44.004 --> 10:45.804
on Thanksgiving.
- Stand guard?

10:45.872 --> 10:47.473
Yeah, because
of Black Friday.

10:47.540 --> 10:48.707
We have more product
in the store

10:48.775 --> 10:49.975
than ever before,
and you three

10:50.043 --> 10:51.744
are gonna make certain
nobody steals it.

10:59.219 --> 11:00.919
Answer it.
- Not on the first ring.

11:00.987 --> 11:02.154
It implies
an eagerness

11:02.222 --> 11:03.656
that I'm not really
feeling right now.

11:03.723 --> 11:05.224
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

11:05.292 --> 11:06.625
Hi, hi, hi, Jill.

11:09.329 --> 11:10.896
A-a date?

11:10.964 --> 11:12.064
Tonight?

11:12.132 --> 11:13.966
Yeah, sounds...
sounds great.

11:14.034 --> 11:15.067
Where?

11:15.135 --> 11:16.969
It's a surprise.

11:18.271 --> 11:20.005
Of course I can tell
my bodyguards

11:20.073 --> 11:21.907
to take the night off
so we can be alone.

11:21.975 --> 11:22.841
Just the two of us.

11:24.177 --> 11:26.178
I'm looking forward
to it as well.

11:28.281 --> 11:29.415
Ow, ow!

11:29.482 --> 11:30.549
What are you doing?

11:30.617 --> 11:32.051
What was that for?
- The kissy noise.

11:32.118 --> 11:33.519
Have some self-respect,
Bartowski.

11:33.586 --> 11:35.087
You're a man.

11:35.155 --> 11:37.056
I got to go talk to Sarah.

11:43.830 --> 11:45.497
What... what is it?

11:45.565 --> 11:46.832
Sarah, I need your help.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.167
How am I gonna survive tonight?

11:49.336 --> 11:51.303
Well, a good spy knows

11:51.371 --> 11:52.771
what their
mark wants.

11:52.839 --> 11:54.540
And what do we
know about Jill?

11:54.607 --> 11:56.575
She's a spy;
she wants you to be

11:56.643 --> 11:58.444
under her spell.
- Okay, how do I do that?

11:58.511 --> 11:59.845
She's gonna test you.

11:59.913 --> 12:01.847
When the time is right,
she's gonna make certain

12:01.915 --> 12:03.882
that she has you,
that you love her.

12:03.950 --> 12:05.484
How is she gonna do that?

12:05.552 --> 12:07.119
When you're
most exposed.

12:07.187 --> 12:08.620
Emotionally exposed.

12:08.688 --> 12:11.223
Like a... an intimate moment,
say, a kiss.

12:11.291 --> 12:13.025
Okay.

12:13.093 --> 12:14.426
Imagine that I am Jill.

12:14.494 --> 12:15.794
The moment
is romantic.

12:15.862 --> 12:17.029
She's close to you.

12:17.097 --> 12:19.164
She's looking
into your eyes.

12:19.232 --> 12:20.833
Got it, okay.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.067
You got... I-I got that.

12:22.135 --> 12:23.402
I'm trying not
to be distracted

12:23.470 --> 12:24.770
by the oh-so-romantic
secret base.

12:29.042 --> 12:30.442
Concentrate, Chuck.

12:30.510 --> 12:31.744
Keep looking into my eyes.

12:31.811 --> 12:33.012
Don't look up.

12:33.079 --> 12:35.180
And if you can't
hold Jill's stare,

12:35.248 --> 12:36.415
look at her lips.

12:36.483 --> 12:38.217
Good.

12:38.284 --> 12:40.419
Now, move her hair
back over her ear.

12:43.223 --> 12:45.024
And when you
start to kiss,

12:45.091 --> 12:47.760
focus again on her.

12:47.827 --> 12:51.063
And just before your lips
are about to meet,

12:51.131 --> 12:52.798
close your eyes.

12:56.136 --> 12:57.136
Okay, good.

12:57.203 --> 12:59.505
Good, you're all set.

12:59.572 --> 13:00.506
Huh?

13:01.941 --> 13:03.008
Oh, yeah, good.

13:03.076 --> 13:04.109
Hey.

13:04.177 --> 13:05.744
NSA just picked up
a purchase

13:05.812 --> 13:06.979
on Jill's credit card.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.547
Two tickets
to some stupid concert

13:08.615 --> 13:10.482
down at the Music Center.

13:10.550 --> 13:12.184
Better not be another
freaking opera.

13:12.252 --> 13:13.986
Well, we'll be there
waiting for you.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.387
Look, just remember,

13:15.455 --> 13:16.588
Jill is capable of anything.

13:34.341 --> 13:35.774
You look great.

13:35.842 --> 13:37.109
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

13:41.081 --> 13:43.716
So, what do you
think of my surprise?

13:43.783 --> 13:45.951
Uh, weren't-weren't we
supposed to...

13:46.019 --> 13:46.952
What?

13:47.020 --> 13:48.520
Nothing, nothing.

13:48.588 --> 13:50.956
If I seem tense, it's just my
irrational fear of carnivals

13:51.024 --> 13:52.391
acting up on me.
- Oh, right.

13:52.459 --> 13:53.892
Come here. I've got
another surprise for you.

14:01.701 --> 14:04.103
You saw this coming,
didn't you?

14:04.170 --> 14:06.038
You bribed a carny.

14:07.474 --> 14:09.775
You know what
happens next?

14:09.843 --> 14:12.077
You get really,
really nervous,

14:12.145 --> 14:13.979
and then you
ramble on

14:14.047 --> 14:15.848
for a couple seconds,
and then...

14:17.017 --> 14:18.851
I have to kiss you.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.900
I'm sorry, Chuck.

14:36.836 --> 14:38.237
For what?

14:48.543 --> 14:49.676
What are you doing?

14:49.744 --> 14:51.044
I work for a group
called FULCRUM.

14:51.112 --> 14:52.880
You know who they are,
don't you, Chuck?

14:52.947 --> 14:55.182
I plan to eliminate you.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.317
Jill, please don't do this.
- Believe me, Chuck.

14:57.385 --> 14:59.052
I don't want to.
I'm not a killer.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.921
This isn't what I do for a living.
- You pull that trigger,

15:00.989 --> 15:02.289
and it is what you do
for a living.

15:02.357 --> 15:03.290
You already broke my heart.

15:03.358 --> 15:04.391
Is it necessary for you

15:04.459 --> 15:05.359
to shoot it as well?

15:09.597 --> 15:10.731
You're right.

15:12.667 --> 15:14.701
Okay, Chuck, here's the truth.

15:14.769 --> 15:16.036
There's a FULCRUM operative
down there.

15:16.104 --> 15:17.137
He's watching
us right now.

15:17.205 --> 15:19.139
I'm supposed
to transport you to a car

15:19.207 --> 15:21.108
in the parking lot, and if
I don't follow their plan,

15:21.176 --> 15:22.509
they're gonna eliminate
you and me

15:22.577 --> 15:24.211
as a precaution.

15:26.581 --> 15:27.981
We're almost
to the Music Center.

15:28.049 --> 15:28.949
What's the ETA

15:29.017 --> 15:30.717
on Chuck and the FULCRUM agent?

15:31.953 --> 15:33.454
Wait, I lost him.

15:33.521 --> 15:35.722
His signal just dropped off the grid.
- What?!

15:35.790 --> 15:37.357
It was a ghost.
Turn us around, Casey, now!

15:41.930 --> 15:43.430
They're not at the Music Center.

15:43.498 --> 15:44.531
North 101. Go!

15:46.167 --> 15:48.769
Chuck, you have to
do exactly what I say, okay?

15:48.837 --> 15:50.237
I think you should know

15:50.305 --> 15:51.972
that my completely
rational fear of carnivals

15:52.040 --> 15:53.273
has spread to ex-girlfriends.

15:53.341 --> 15:55.342
I mean, how do I know
I can trust you?

15:55.410 --> 15:57.411
How do I know you're
not just gonna take me

15:57.479 --> 15:58.879
to the parking lot
to do something

15:58.947 --> 16:00.013
you said you wouldn't?
- Oh, no.

16:00.081 --> 16:01.048
It's him.

16:01.116 --> 16:02.416
Who's him? Him who?

16:04.452 --> 16:05.719
Leader.

16:11.626 --> 16:13.627
Okay, come here.

16:21.803 --> 16:23.137
Um, excuse us,

16:23.204 --> 16:24.605
person we don't know,
you're blocking us.

16:24.672 --> 16:26.106
His handlers are closing in.

16:26.174 --> 16:27.574
Eliminate him.

16:27.642 --> 16:29.176
What, here?

16:29.244 --> 16:30.110
Don't think.
- Shoot him

16:30.178 --> 16:31.311
in the head and let's go.

16:31.379 --> 16:32.913
Did-did you...
did you just say...

16:32.981 --> 16:34.348
Let's talk about this first.

16:34.415 --> 16:36.450
Think I should just leave
if there's a... ow!

16:36.518 --> 16:37.618
This is a test, Jill.

16:37.685 --> 16:38.752
Do it now.

16:39.954 --> 16:40.988
Too late.

16:45.527 --> 16:47.561
You're making a big mistake.

16:52.167 --> 16:53.433
Sorry, sorry, excuse me!

17:06.481 --> 17:08.582
Mr. Bartowski.

17:10.351 --> 17:11.585
You need
to come with me.

17:11.653 --> 17:14.454
Um, you told Jill to shoot me.

17:14.521 --> 17:16.490
Why would I ever
go anywhere with you?

17:16.558 --> 17:19.092
I'd rather not leave your body
here on the ride.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.794
What if some kid saw it?

17:23.263 --> 17:25.299
Wow, that's, uh...

17:25.366 --> 17:27.601
that's strangely considerate
of you.

18:30.265 --> 18:30.330
Okay.

18:52.954 --> 18:54.555
That's exactly how I feel.

18:54.622 --> 18:57.925
Chuck, you have to trust me.
- Jill?

18:57.992 --> 18:59.426
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

18:59.494 --> 19:00.961
Where are you?

19:01.029 --> 19:02.796
Jill, where are you?
Why are you doing this?

19:02.864 --> 19:04.898
When did you join FULCRUM
and why?

19:07.535 --> 19:09.136
It started
at Stanford.

19:09.204 --> 19:10.704
They sponsored

19:10.772 --> 19:12.306
a leadership seminar.

19:12.373 --> 19:14.608
After school, whatever job
we wanted, they got us.

19:14.676 --> 19:17.644
They made our dreams
come true.

19:17.712 --> 19:18.946
Couldn't you get out?

19:19.013 --> 19:19.980
When someone
controls

19:20.048 --> 19:21.482
every part of your life, Chuck,

19:21.549 --> 19:23.250
you have to do what they say.

19:23.318 --> 19:26.220
After a while,
I found myself doing things

19:26.287 --> 19:28.322
I never thought
I would have done, but...

19:28.389 --> 19:31.125
but then it was too late.

19:31.192 --> 19:33.227
Too late for what?

19:33.294 --> 19:34.761
Jill?

19:34.829 --> 19:36.396
Jill!

19:37.632 --> 19:40.567
I'm impressed,
Mr. Bartowski.

19:40.635 --> 19:42.970
I wasn't really certain
you were a spy,

19:43.037 --> 19:45.439
but... now I see.

19:57.786 --> 19:58.819
Good-bye.

20:10.498 --> 20:12.800
Chuck, come on.

20:18.039 --> 20:19.940
Don't move!

20:20.008 --> 20:21.742
No, no, wait,
wait, wait!

20:21.810 --> 20:22.976
Don't hurt her.

20:23.044 --> 20:24.578
She saved my life.

20:34.558 --> 20:36.325
# #

20:38.154 --> 20:40.088
So one more time,
what's the plan?

20:40.156 --> 20:42.124
We stay here
in the store all day.

20:42.192 --> 20:43.659
Anything goes wrong, we call you.
- Good.

20:43.726 --> 20:46.462
Remember, you three are the last
line of defense against...

20:46.529 --> 20:48.363
Yeah, but, can I...
this is a bit overkill.

20:48.431 --> 20:49.498
Overkill?

20:49.566 --> 20:50.265
Dude.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.400
Grimes, my first store

20:51.468 --> 20:53.101
was The Husky Lad:
Big and Tall.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.671
"For the more than
average man."

20:55.738 --> 20:56.772
It was robbed.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.273
Thanksgiving of '88.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.275
That was a dark day, Morgan.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.244
Husky lads throughout Burbank

21:02.312 --> 21:04.079
went without britches
for Christmas.

21:04.147 --> 21:07.116
The store closed
before the new year.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.350
So, no...

21:08.418 --> 21:10.152
it's not overkill.

21:10.220 --> 21:11.220
It's business.

21:11.287 --> 21:13.522
Sure.

21:13.590 --> 21:15.991
Um, but before you lock us in,

21:16.059 --> 21:18.660
um, isn't there some
sort of law or rule

21:18.728 --> 21:20.362
about locking us in the store?
I mean, what if there's a fire?

21:20.430 --> 21:21.697
I'm not worried about a fire.

21:21.764 --> 21:23.665
I'm worried
about thieves.

21:23.733 --> 21:25.934
All right, Lady Big
Mike is cooking

21:26.002 --> 21:27.736
with the family;
I got fish to catch.

21:29.906 --> 21:31.740
Lady Big Mike?

21:40.817 --> 21:43.118
Everything's going
to be all right.

21:46.356 --> 21:49.158
Answer all of our questions
with a "yes" or "no."

21:49.225 --> 21:50.325
Okay.

21:50.393 --> 21:51.760
Is your name Jill Roberts?

21:51.828 --> 21:53.462
Yes.

21:55.498 --> 21:58.400
Did you attend
Stanford University?

21:58.468 --> 21:59.535
Yes.

22:01.638 --> 22:03.038
Can I ask a follow-up question?

22:03.106 --> 22:04.206
You're about to leave
through that window.

22:04.274 --> 22:05.707
I rescind my follow-up question.

22:05.775 --> 22:07.910
Do you have a degree
in molecular biology?

22:07.977 --> 22:08.544
Yes.

22:10.346 --> 22:12.214
Are you a FULCRUM agent?

22:12.282 --> 22:13.382
No. Wait...

22:13.450 --> 22:15.517
I'm sorry.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.586
Telling the truth is new to me.

22:17.654 --> 22:19.721
Yes,

22:19.789 --> 22:22.157
I am a FULCRUM agent.

22:22.225 --> 22:25.127
Do you know the current
whereabouts of your FULCRUM

22:25.195 --> 22:29.164
handler,
codename Leader?

22:29.232 --> 22:30.766
Do you know the current

22:30.834 --> 22:32.935
whereabouts of your FULCRUM handler...
- Yes.

22:33.002 --> 22:34.403
Give us the location now.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.042
Tell me now or I lose my calm.
- Jill.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.243
Jill, just tell, just tell him.

22:41.311 --> 22:42.644
Please, just tell him.

22:42.712 --> 22:44.613
Okay, I'm not supposed
to know this,

22:44.681 --> 22:46.381
but FULCRUM has
a mobile medical unit.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.550
You'll find Leader recovering
in an office building

22:48.618 --> 22:50.052
in downtown Los Angeles.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.121
Is this a trap?

22:52.188 --> 22:53.422
No.

22:59.529 --> 23:00.863
What about Jill, Sarah?

23:00.930 --> 23:02.297
I know what
you're thinking.

23:02.365 --> 23:04.633
That Jill is the same person
that you went to school with,

23:04.701 --> 23:06.468
and the same person
that you dated.

23:06.536 --> 23:08.137
But we cannot
be certain.

23:08.204 --> 23:11.006
Trust me, Chuck.
You can't trust her.

23:17.380 --> 23:19.314
Is he setting a trap?
- Mm-hmm.

23:19.382 --> 23:21.550
Good friend Jeffrey's been doing
this job for, give or take,

23:21.618 --> 23:22.785
15 years.

23:22.852 --> 23:24.353
This is his Thanksgiving
tradition.

23:24.420 --> 23:25.654
Amazing.

23:25.722 --> 23:26.855
How many traps
does he set?

23:26.923 --> 23:28.657
Just the one trip wire,
it's kind of sad.

23:28.725 --> 23:29.992
He tripped over it
last year.

23:30.059 --> 23:31.794
Anyway, bon appétit,

23:31.861 --> 23:33.796
buddy. Mmm.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.233
Turkey in plastic? No, no.

23:38.301 --> 23:39.501
Les, this is
all wrong.

23:39.569 --> 23:40.669
This is not what
Thanksgiving's about.

23:40.737 --> 23:41.737
This is pathetic.

23:41.805 --> 23:43.438
Dude.
- What?

23:43.506 --> 23:44.706
What else is there?

23:44.774 --> 23:46.542
There's so much more.

23:46.609 --> 23:48.644
Man, yeah, there's-there's fun,
and food, and friends.

23:48.711 --> 23:50.312
And that's, that's just the Fs.

23:50.380 --> 23:51.613
Where?

23:51.681 --> 23:53.315
Out there.

23:55.485 --> 23:58.353
Morgan, we can't leave.

24:00.290 --> 24:02.191
Dude, what if I could
bring it back here?

24:02.258 --> 24:04.259
A turkey.

24:04.327 --> 24:05.327
We, we...
- No, not-not,

24:05.395 --> 24:06.395
not like this.

24:06.463 --> 24:08.530
A real turkey?
- Yes!

24:13.002 --> 24:16.171
What do I have to do
to get this...

24:16.239 --> 24:18.273
real turkey?

24:18.341 --> 24:20.542
# #

24:20.610 --> 24:22.311
Okay, motor's off.
Come on.

24:22.378 --> 24:23.846
Dude, we
got to push harder here.

24:23.913 --> 24:24.947
I'm trying.

24:25.014 --> 24:26.048
I'm trying.
- Come on.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.516
This is such a fire hazard.

24:27.584 --> 24:28.684
Look, look, look.
- Okay, okay.

24:30.253 --> 24:31.353
Hold, hold, you
got to hold it.

24:31.421 --> 24:32.621
Ow!

24:32.689 --> 24:34.490
Jeff!

24:34.557 --> 24:35.724
Open the door, buddy.
Open the door.

24:35.792 --> 24:36.625
Okay.

24:36.693 --> 24:37.459
Oh, my Lord.

24:37.527 --> 24:39.695
Jeff!
- Got it.

24:39.762 --> 24:43.065
Okay, nice, Jeff.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.600
Now can you
open the door

24:44.667 --> 24:46.235
that is currently
chopping me in half?

24:46.302 --> 24:48.370
Oops. My bad.

24:48.438 --> 24:50.272
Okay, just pull.
Just pull.

25:01.718 --> 25:03.485
Did he make it?

25:23.773 --> 25:25.374
Security breach at Buy More

25:25.441 --> 25:27.976
location 2453.

25:28.044 --> 25:30.212
Security breach at Buy More

25:30.280 --> 25:33.048
location 2453.

25:34.417 --> 25:36.418
T-time is 45 minutes.

25:36.486 --> 25:37.886
What time are your parents
getting here?

25:37.954 --> 25:39.354
Okay.

25:39.422 --> 25:40.956
Mm-hmm.

25:41.024 --> 25:42.624
I love you, too.

25:42.692 --> 25:43.792
Babe...
- Hmm?

25:43.860 --> 25:45.894
I got some news.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.763
My parents
can't make it.

25:49.466 --> 25:51.667
Don't toy with my emotions
right now, Devon.

25:51.734 --> 25:53.669
Honey, I wouldn't dare.

25:53.736 --> 25:55.604
You're serious?

25:55.672 --> 25:57.339
Yeah.
- Oh, that's great!

25:57.407 --> 25:59.575
Oh, that's so great!

25:59.642 --> 26:01.743
Oh, my God.
- Now can we just have some fun?

26:01.811 --> 26:03.645
Yes!
- Listen to Chuck's stories.

26:03.713 --> 26:05.514
Laugh at Morgan
as he o-faces

26:05.582 --> 26:08.050
through his, his mashed
potatoes and stuffing.

26:08.118 --> 26:10.052
Oh, no!

26:10.120 --> 26:11.553
I uninvited Morgan.

26:11.621 --> 26:12.788
He's like the one person

26:12.856 --> 26:14.156
who loves this dinner
more than everyone.

26:18.628 --> 26:21.396
Ah, man, some animals
got in the trash again.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.670
Oh, what?

26:30.874 --> 26:32.674
Well, I saw you
put it in the bag.

26:32.742 --> 26:34.443
You know, and I figured
it was still gonna be good.

26:34.511 --> 26:35.844
So I...

26:35.912 --> 26:36.879
Okay.

26:38.047 --> 26:40.048
Morgan, I'm so sorry

26:40.116 --> 26:41.817
that I uninvited you
to Thanksgiving.

26:41.885 --> 26:43.018
Please, please forgive me.

26:43.086 --> 26:44.019
Forgive you?

26:44.087 --> 26:45.454
Yeah, of course.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.589
Yes, I understand.
I completely understand.

26:47.657 --> 26:49.925
I mean, you've been so stressed
out with this whole thing

26:49.993 --> 26:51.627
and, you know, with our
new boss at work

26:51.694 --> 26:53.128
and this Chuck
and Jill thing

26:53.196 --> 26:54.763
is like...
- What Chuck and Jill thing?

26:54.831 --> 26:56.031
Hmm?

26:56.099 --> 26:57.266
What Jill thing?
- I didn't say anything...

26:57.333 --> 26:58.901
Morgan, you tell me
everything that you know.

26:58.968 --> 27:00.369
Mm-hmm. Absolutely, I will.

27:00.436 --> 27:02.137
Can I just get one
small favor?

27:02.205 --> 27:03.872
I need to invite a
couple guests over.

27:07.010 --> 27:08.877
Chuck?

27:11.014 --> 27:12.381
Hey.

27:12.449 --> 27:13.182
Hey.

27:20.490 --> 27:22.891
I was just seeing
if you, you know,

27:22.959 --> 27:24.626
if you needed a water
or something.

27:24.694 --> 27:26.595
No, I'm good.

27:26.663 --> 27:28.497
Are Casey and Sarah ready
to start again?

27:28.565 --> 27:30.466
Um, no.

27:30.533 --> 27:32.034
No, not just yet.

27:32.101 --> 27:34.570
But before they do,

27:34.637 --> 27:38.006
I was wondering if I could
maybe ask you a few things.

27:38.074 --> 27:40.108
Do you know how to work
all this stuff?

27:40.176 --> 27:41.677
Yeah, totally.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.645
I, uh, read the manual.

27:43.713 --> 27:45.280
You read a lie
detector manual?

27:45.348 --> 27:48.283
No, this is the manual
for the entire Castle base.

27:48.351 --> 27:51.253
Oh, you read a manual
for a base?

27:51.321 --> 27:53.188
Well, you know, I mean, um...

27:54.357 --> 27:56.225
...I skimmed it.

27:58.094 --> 28:00.796
Would you, uh,

28:00.864 --> 28:02.764
would you mind if I ask you
a couple questions?

28:02.832 --> 28:04.433
Go ahead.

28:15.979 --> 28:17.913
Back at Stanford,

28:17.981 --> 28:19.848
when we were dating,

28:19.916 --> 28:22.417
was that for real?

28:22.485 --> 28:24.219
Yes.

28:28.091 --> 28:30.025
You really liked me?

28:30.093 --> 28:31.760
Those were real emotions?

28:31.828 --> 28:33.095
Yes.

28:37.534 --> 28:40.335
Okay, then, well then
why did you sleep with Bryce

28:40.403 --> 28:42.004
right after I got kicked
out of school?

28:42.071 --> 28:44.006
Chuck, it has to be a "yes" or
"no" question or it won't work.

28:44.073 --> 28:46.308
Did you love him, too?

28:46.376 --> 28:48.644
No.

28:52.749 --> 28:54.483
Great.

28:54.551 --> 28:56.218
That's great.
That makes it even worse.

28:56.286 --> 28:58.187
There's a question
you're not asking.

28:58.254 --> 29:00.989
It's right there, and
you're not asking it.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.128
Did you sleep with Bryce?

29:06.196 --> 29:07.830
No.

29:09.032 --> 29:10.632
I didn't.

29:27.183 --> 29:28.317
Everyone freeze!

29:31.254 --> 29:32.254
Take 'em all out of here.

29:32.322 --> 29:33.822
Except this one on the table.

29:33.890 --> 29:36.492
He's mine.

29:36.559 --> 29:38.260
So you're telling me

29:38.328 --> 29:41.430
that for the last six years
of my life

29:41.498 --> 29:43.298
I've been believing
that you betrayed me.

29:43.366 --> 29:44.733
Why would you do that?

29:44.801 --> 29:46.568
When you got kicked
out of school,

29:46.636 --> 29:49.371
my FULCRUM advisor said
that I had to let you go.

29:49.439 --> 29:50.606
Now you weren't
talking to Bryce,

29:50.673 --> 29:52.274
so that was the easiest
way to do it.

29:52.342 --> 29:53.976
I'm so sorry, Chuck.

29:54.043 --> 29:56.678
I don't believe this.

29:56.746 --> 29:59.348
FULCRUM told you to dump me?

29:59.415 --> 30:01.016
I didn't have a choice.

30:03.086 --> 30:05.687
I guess
in your defense,

30:05.755 --> 30:07.990
when they told you to kill me,
you didn't do it.

30:08.057 --> 30:10.559
So, I guess
that means something.

30:10.627 --> 30:11.560
It does.

30:13.663 --> 30:16.398
I never wanted to hurt you,
Chuck, ever.

30:18.134 --> 30:20.002
You were my first love.

30:26.709 --> 30:29.511
Do you think that
when this is all over,

30:29.579 --> 30:31.547
we could try again?

30:31.614 --> 30:33.449
Get me out of these.

30:41.791 --> 30:43.625
Yes.

30:53.403 --> 30:56.171
Chuck, we have Leader.

30:56.239 --> 30:58.307
We're taking him back to Castle.

30:58.374 --> 31:00.075
Great. See you
when you get back.

31:04.247 --> 31:06.115
I'm sorry, Chuck.

31:21.402 --> 31:22.603
Chuck?

31:22.670 --> 31:24.538
Chuck, what's the matter?
- You promised

31:24.606 --> 31:26.573
that you wouldn't hurt them.

31:28.209 --> 31:29.543
Put the guns on the table,

31:29.611 --> 31:31.445
take the cuffs off now.

31:31.513 --> 31:32.346
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31:32.414 --> 31:33.347
I let her out.

31:33.415 --> 31:34.381
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

31:52.467 --> 31:55.736
Now, I believe we were headed
to a holding area.

31:55.804 --> 31:56.770
Show me the way.

32:08.850 --> 32:10.684
Chuck, do what he says
and you'll be okay.

32:10.752 --> 32:12.519
What about my friends?

32:12.587 --> 32:14.188
Just do what he says.

32:14.255 --> 32:16.457
How could you do this, Jill?

32:16.524 --> 32:17.658
Chuck, it's complicated.

32:18.960 --> 32:21.595
Listen, I know
complicated, okay?

32:21.663 --> 32:22.930
How could <i>you</i> do this?

32:22.997 --> 32:25.065
You did

32:25.133 --> 32:26.667
an excellent job, my dear.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.374
Show him the access screen

32:34.442 --> 32:35.876
for the Joint
Intelligence Database.

32:35.944 --> 32:38.245
Um, I'm sorry.
I don't know how to do that.

32:38.313 --> 32:40.347
Do it now
or I'll kill your friends,

32:40.415 --> 32:44.051
starting
with the blonde.

32:51.993 --> 32:54.261
Thank you, Chuck.

32:54.329 --> 32:57.231
This was all a trick, wasn't it?

32:57.298 --> 32:58.499
I mean, you guys
just did all this

32:58.566 --> 32:59.967
just to get in here
and access our computer.

33:00.034 --> 33:01.368
Y-You, you let her shoot you.

33:01.436 --> 33:03.003
Devious, aren't we?
Move him.

33:12.814 --> 33:15.916
Oh, baby.

33:17.118 --> 33:18.952
Jill, you're making
a big mistake.

33:19.020 --> 33:22.055
I have to do
what he says, Chuck.

33:22.123 --> 33:23.690
Why? Why? What is
your boss searching for?

33:23.758 --> 33:24.858
I mean, what,

33:24.926 --> 33:26.527
what secret is worth this?
He's searching

33:26.594 --> 33:27.995
for someone.

33:28.062 --> 33:29.496
Who?
- Bryce Larkin.

33:30.832 --> 33:32.933
Bryce?

33:33.001 --> 33:34.368
Why are you looking for Bryce?

33:34.436 --> 33:35.335
Chuck, don't try
and protect him.

33:35.403 --> 33:37.337
We know he's CIA.

33:37.405 --> 33:39.573
He stole something from us.

33:42.577 --> 33:44.478
They're looking
for the Intersect.

33:44.546 --> 33:45.712
I'm sorry, Sarah.

33:45.780 --> 33:47.514
I should have listened to you.

33:47.582 --> 33:48.816
We'll figure something out.
- Actually,

33:48.883 --> 33:50.184
I have a plan.

33:50.251 --> 33:51.952
Hey,

33:52.020 --> 33:53.287
what are you doing?

33:53.354 --> 33:54.855
That's the Castle manual.
I told you that's

33:54.923 --> 33:56.356
top secret.

33:56.424 --> 33:57.758
Yeah, I know.

33:57.826 --> 33:58.659
So am I.

34:10.505 --> 34:13.139
Chuck.

34:14.342 --> 34:16.610
What did you do?

34:16.678 --> 34:19.480
Like I told Jill,
I read the manual.

34:19.547 --> 34:21.547
What... did you do?

34:21.616 --> 34:23.183
Well, I locked you out
of the computer system

34:23.251 --> 34:24.985
using the remote console
that every room

34:25.053 --> 34:26.620
in Castle is
equipped with.

34:26.688 --> 34:27.920
It's in the manual.

34:27.989 --> 34:31.091
Unfortunately, said manual
is in here with me,

34:31.159 --> 34:33.761
and since I overrode
Castle's primary controls,

34:33.828 --> 34:36.697
we're now safely locked
within these bulletproof cells.

34:36.764 --> 34:39.666
Devious, aren't I?

34:39.734 --> 34:42.136
I'll make one call and my men
will be here in 20 minutes.

34:42.203 --> 34:43.704
I'm so glad you
brought that up

34:43.772 --> 34:46.739
because I also activated the
base's communications jammer,

34:46.808 --> 34:48.041
so no calls out--

34:48.109 --> 34:49.376
sorry about that--

34:49.444 --> 34:52.012
and because I triggered
the CIA's trouble alarm,

34:52.080 --> 34:55.014
I think the cavalry's going
to be here in ten minutes or so.

34:55.083 --> 34:56.550
The nerd in me

34:56.618 --> 35:00.254
really, really wants to say
"Checkmate" right about now.

35:00.321 --> 35:01.789
Never say that.

35:01.856 --> 35:03.424
Why?
- Because you don't know

35:03.491 --> 35:05.826
who you're playing against.

35:05.894 --> 35:06.960
These cells

35:07.028 --> 35:08.462
might be
bulletproof,

35:08.530 --> 35:10.030
but they can't withstand that.

35:10.098 --> 35:12.900
The blast will kill them,

35:12.967 --> 35:14.601
but I'll bet
your cell will be fine.

35:14.669 --> 35:16.236
Chuck, don't do anything.

35:16.304 --> 35:18.005
Stay in that cell, Bartowski.

35:18.072 --> 35:20.107
Jill?
- Just do what he says, Chuck.

35:20.175 --> 35:21.442
Open the door

35:21.509 --> 35:22.910
or your friends will die.

35:28.383 --> 35:30.384
Good-bye, Mr. Bartowski.

35:30.452 --> 35:31.485
W-W-W-W-Wait!

35:31.553 --> 35:33.253
Wait.

35:38.660 --> 35:41.295
Now, show me the way
out of here.

35:42.664 --> 35:44.498
Jill, if you hurt him,
I swear...

36:08.523 --> 36:10.290
It's a message
from Chuck.

36:38.186 --> 36:40.487
# #

36:50.365 --> 36:51.165
Drop it!

36:55.670 --> 36:57.704
Sarah, don't hurt her!

37:17.092 --> 37:18.992
Jill, Jill.

37:19.060 --> 37:20.861
Hey, I can
help you.

37:20.929 --> 37:22.262
Come with me.

37:24.466 --> 37:25.566
Come on.

37:43.685 --> 37:45.185
You thought
you were going to

37:45.253 --> 37:46.220
take me down?

37:46.287 --> 37:47.755
No, baby, I am!

38:04.639 --> 38:06.940
I hate thieves.

38:07.008 --> 38:09.610
Grimes put you in charge?

38:09.677 --> 38:10.611
Yeah.

38:10.678 --> 38:13.046
Smart boy.

38:13.114 --> 38:14.715
<i>What's going on?</i>

38:14.783 --> 38:16.450
What are we doing?
- Look...

38:16.518 --> 38:17.885
you're taking
the Matrix, okay?

38:17.952 --> 38:18.952
All-wheel drive,

38:19.020 --> 38:20.654
touch screen navi,
iPod capability,

38:20.722 --> 38:22.022
and a full tank of gas.

38:22.090 --> 38:23.424
It's the perfect
getaway car.

38:23.491 --> 38:25.626
Just get in
and drive as far as you can.

38:25.693 --> 38:27.060
I won't call it in, I swear.

38:27.128 --> 38:29.329
Thank you.

38:31.466 --> 38:33.400
Come with me.

38:33.468 --> 38:34.768
We can still be together.

38:34.836 --> 38:36.537
How?

38:36.604 --> 38:37.538
Just you and me.

38:37.605 --> 38:40.074
No secrets, no spies.

38:40.141 --> 38:43.043
Come with me, Chuck.

38:43.111 --> 38:44.778
No, I, I can't. I can't.

38:44.846 --> 38:46.547
I... look,
obviously,

38:46.614 --> 38:49.450
there's the whole "opposites
attract" chemistry thing

38:49.517 --> 38:51.251
that we have, and I, I...

38:51.319 --> 38:54.621
it's just the-there's,
there's one small problem.

38:56.024 --> 38:57.357
What are you doing, Chuck?

39:05.700 --> 39:07.701
What's going on?
Don't do this to me, Chuck.

39:07.769 --> 39:09.203
You should know
I wanted to help you.

39:09.270 --> 39:11.572
I was going to
let you get away.

39:11.639 --> 39:12.806
Chuck, no.

39:12.874 --> 39:14.708
But when you were
about to kill Sarah,

39:14.776 --> 39:16.610
you made the
decision for me.

39:17.779 --> 39:19.379
You're under arrest, Jill,

39:19.447 --> 39:20.981
and I'm
breaking up

39:21.049 --> 39:21.982
with you.

39:35.403 --> 39:36.736
I'm sorry, Sarah.

39:36.804 --> 39:38.505
I should have listened
to you from the beginning.

39:38.572 --> 39:40.407
You were right: I wasn't
ready for this mission.

39:40.474 --> 39:43.009
No one is ready for this type
of mission, Chuck.

39:43.077 --> 39:44.978
Your girlfriend
being FULCRUM

39:45.046 --> 39:46.579
isn't something
they teach you in spy school.

39:46.647 --> 39:47.547
I'm just too trusting.

39:47.615 --> 39:49.082
Ever since I was a kid,

39:49.150 --> 39:50.750
I really wanted to believe
what everybody always told me.

39:50.818 --> 39:52.052
You know?

39:52.119 --> 39:53.586
I'm just getting used
to this new job--

39:53.654 --> 39:55.055
all the spying and lying.

39:55.122 --> 39:56.323
Don't get used to it.

39:56.390 --> 39:57.657
What makes you special

39:57.725 --> 39:59.426
is that you're not
like every other spy.

39:59.493 --> 40:01.795
You're a good guy,
and you want to help people.

40:01.862 --> 40:03.730
Leave the deception to me.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.600
I'm glad I have you.

40:07.668 --> 40:10.437
# #

40:11.706 --> 40:13.573
Yeah, we're better as a team.

40:15.343 --> 40:17.210
Oh, yeah.

40:17.278 --> 40:18.211
Happy Thanksgiving.

40:18.279 --> 40:19.446
Can I borrow you?

40:19.513 --> 40:21.381
Sorry, I'm stealing
him real quick.

40:21.449 --> 40:24.351
Are you absolutely certain
that Jill is not with Chuck?

40:24.418 --> 40:26.653
Yeah, I mean, that's what
he, that's what he tol...

40:26.721 --> 40:28.588
Why, you think that Chuck's
gonna break up with Sarah?

40:28.656 --> 40:30.557
Well, I hope not.

40:30.625 --> 40:31.958
Yeah, me, too.

40:32.026 --> 40:33.193
You know what
we need here?

40:33.260 --> 40:34.427
What?
- Thanksgiving miracle.

40:34.495 --> 40:35.795
Yeah, y-y-yeah,
listen.

40:35.863 --> 40:37.097
Chuck and Sarah are gonna
walk through that door,

40:37.164 --> 40:38.765
they're going to be
as happy as can be,

40:38.833 --> 40:40.000
and everything's
going to be fine.

40:41.535 --> 40:43.236
Wow, good job, Morgan.

40:43.304 --> 40:44.504
Hi.

40:44.572 --> 40:45.872
I could have asked
for anything.

40:45.940 --> 40:46.940
Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi.

40:47.008 --> 40:48.141
Happy Thanksgiving.

40:50.344 --> 40:53.680
Ellie, uh, do you, do you
realize that Lester and Jeff

40:53.748 --> 40:55.115
of the Nerd Herd
are at our table

40:55.182 --> 40:56.249
right now? Is
everything okay?

40:56.317 --> 40:57.984
Yes, well,
the Awesomes couldn't make it,

40:58.052 --> 40:59.319
so you know me--

40:59.387 --> 41:01.354
just expand Thanksgiving.

41:01.422 --> 41:03.423
Okay.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

41:03.491 --> 41:04.357
You, too.

41:04.425 --> 41:05.425
Are you okay?

41:05.493 --> 41:06.493
Of course, yeah.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.761
Why, why do you ask?

41:07.828 --> 41:12.132
Well, because Morgan told me
about you and Jill.

41:12.199 --> 41:13.566
I'm sorry.
I just...

41:13.634 --> 41:14.968
I was worried about you.

41:15.036 --> 41:17.304
Um, no, yeah,
everything's good.

41:17.371 --> 41:19.039
She wanted to see if
we could work it out

41:19.106 --> 41:21.207
and maybe give it a second try.
- And?

41:21.275 --> 41:24.411
And I realized that Jill,
Stanford, and Bryce--

41:24.478 --> 41:25.578
that's the story
from my past.

41:27.148 --> 41:29.950
But my new story is you
and Sarah and these...

41:30.017 --> 41:31.384
frigging yahoos.

41:31.452 --> 41:32.752
And sometimes...

41:32.820 --> 41:34.688
it can be a really fun story.

41:34.755 --> 41:36.156
Uh, Swedish
bikini team.

41:36.223 --> 41:37.490
Uh, DeLorean, flying DeLorean.

41:37.558 --> 41:38.692
Hey, Morgan.

41:38.759 --> 41:40.527
Come on, buddy.

41:41.662 --> 41:42.996
So anyways, where was I?

41:43.064 --> 41:44.698
Yeah, you were saying how,
how the turkey gets made.

41:44.765 --> 41:46.266
You were saying that
the turkeys volunteer.

41:46.334 --> 41:48.068
No, they don't.
It's more of a draft.

41:48.135 --> 41:52.005
Toast to, uh, some of the great,
uh, faces that I know

41:52.073 --> 41:53.173
and some new ones
to Thanksgiving.

41:53.240 --> 41:54.207
Yeah, we don't know
each other.

41:54.275 --> 41:55.742
Hear, hear.

41:55.810 --> 41:58.178
Happy Thanksgiving.

41:58.245 --> 42:00.747
Great job, babe.

42:00.815 --> 42:02.983
Done, first, complete.

42:03.050 --> 42:04.317
One, number one.

42:04.385 --> 42:06.319
I have to carve the turkey.
Careful. Coming through.
