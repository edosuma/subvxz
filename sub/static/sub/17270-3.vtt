WEBVTT

00:01.028 --> 00:02.360
My name is Stephen Jameson.

00:02.363 --> 00:03.529
I am one of the Tomorrow People,

00:03.531 --> 00:05.765
the next step in human evolution.

00:06.412 --> 00:08.913
They call our powers the three T's.

00:08.915 --> 00:09.980
- Telepathy...
- Stephen?

00:09.982 --> 00:11.048
Telekinesis...

00:11.050 --> 00:12.716
And teleportation.

00:12.718 --> 00:15.685
There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...

00:15.687 --> 00:18.321
- No!
-... the secret organization that hunts us.

00:18.323 --> 00:20.690
The only way to keep my
species from going extinct

00:20.692 --> 00:22.158
is to find my father.

00:22.160 --> 00:26.028
And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.

00:26.030 --> 00:28.731
Previously on The Tomorrow People...

00:28.733 --> 00:31.033
Reading someone's thoughts
is just the beginning.

00:31.035 --> 00:32.901
You'll be able to access their feelings.

00:32.903 --> 00:34.302
Even their memories.

00:34.304 --> 00:36.772
Stephen, you have no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

00:36.774 --> 00:38.740
We have a visitor. This is your uncle.

00:38.742 --> 00:40.342
Work for me, Stephen.

00:40.344 --> 00:42.410
We track anything that
can indicate a new breakout

00:42.412 --> 00:45.413
and then we have our agents who
help us track rogue paranormals.

00:45.415 --> 00:46.703
And when the time comes,

00:46.704 --> 00:48.669
Stephen will lead us
to the Tomorrow People.

00:49.285 --> 00:50.785
And we'll kill them.

00:50.787 --> 00:53.087
Stephen. Got someone I'd like you to meet.

00:53.089 --> 00:54.421
Your new partner.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.370 --> 01:10.737
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:12.239 --> 01:14.140
Dude, go for it. That girl
literally doesn't say no.

01:15.977 --> 01:17.176
Why don't you make a move?

01:17.178 --> 01:18.244
I'm just looking out for my wingman.

01:36.228 --> 01:39.430
You can read lips, right?

01:41.333 --> 01:44.135
Good. Well, let me tell you,

01:44.137 --> 01:46.170
you're not missing anything.

01:46.172 --> 01:49.106
The music here sucks.

01:50.242 --> 01:52.943
You wanna get out of here?

01:52.945 --> 01:54.711
Go someplace a little more quiet?

02:08.793 --> 02:10.359
You're really pretty.

02:12.763 --> 02:15.798
How do you say, uh,
"pretty" in sign language?

02:39.922 --> 02:41.088
Hey, hey! Easy.

02:42.757 --> 02:43.891
Heard about you from the guys.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.962
Ow! Ah!

02:47.964 --> 02:49.296
Deaf bitch... get over here!

02:55.136 --> 02:56.135
Hey!

03:00.808 --> 03:01.941
Cara!

03:59.763 --> 04:01.830
Excuse me.

04:01.832 --> 04:02.798
Are you done with that?

04:03.933 --> 04:04.967
Your newspaper.

04:09.205 --> 04:13.208
Way to go, dude. You just creeped her out.

04:13.210 --> 04:15.410
How do I tell her I
didn't get the promotion?

04:15.412 --> 04:17.045
I was so sure. We were so sure.

04:17.047 --> 04:20.380
I'm so tired. I'm so tired.

04:42.414 --> 04:44.449
Hey, just in time.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.185
We figured out a way to
get the jump on Ultra.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.419
A way to save breakouts before
their powers are stripped

04:49.421 --> 04:50.921
or they're turned into agents.

04:50.923 --> 04:55.025
Yes. We are using Ultra's
own intel against them.

04:55.027 --> 04:57.928
My buddy Tim figured it out.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.364
- And who built Tim?
- Who stole his new processor?

05:00.366 --> 05:03.367
Good combo. Up top?

05:03.369 --> 05:04.768
Are you okay?

05:06.703 --> 05:08.805
I thought you... you
were gonna get us food.

05:08.807 --> 05:10.306
Sorry, I, uh...

05:11.341 --> 05:13.109
I got sidetracked.

05:13.111 --> 05:14.177
What's the plan?

05:17.882 --> 05:19.115
We're going to need Stephen.

05:33.229 --> 05:35.030
Uh, I don't think I should drink with...

05:35.032 --> 05:36.164
Your meds.

05:36.356 --> 05:39.256
Yeah, I know. It's just water.

05:39.258 --> 05:41.225
It's a prop. You gotta blend.

05:41.227 --> 05:43.627
I'm blending, okay? Check it out...

05:43.629 --> 05:47.431
Oh... No, no, no, please.
Don't ever do that again.

05:47.433 --> 05:50.334
I, uh, I'm actually trying to
reintegrate you into the social circle,

05:50.336 --> 05:52.402
not have you scare people away.

05:52.404 --> 05:55.872
I know, okay? I get it, but I
don't need you to babysit me.

05:55.874 --> 05:57.040
Good.

06:00.878 --> 06:02.545
She's not wearing a bra.

06:02.547 --> 06:03.846
No wait, she is wearing a bra.

06:05.316 --> 06:07.183
She's not wearing a bra.

06:07.185 --> 06:08.450
Oh, I can't tell.

06:11.554 --> 06:13.355
Twenty calories a chip.

06:13.357 --> 06:15.891
Salsa's another 20, but
I skipped lunch, so...

06:21.164 --> 06:22.231
Really good.

06:25.401 --> 06:26.934
Douche...

06:26.936 --> 06:29.270
Douche... bitch.

06:29.272 --> 06:31.572
Sartre was right. Hell is other people.

06:34.476 --> 06:36.110
What's your problem?

06:36.112 --> 06:39.013
Nothing, um... Emily.

06:39.015 --> 06:41.081
- Stephen...
- Jameson, I remember.

06:41.083 --> 06:42.582
The crazy one

06:42.584 --> 06:44.451
Hey, you know, we should probably split up

06:44.453 --> 06:47.054
before the normal kids think
the freaks are starting a club.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.444
What is her problem?

06:54.446 --> 06:56.812
Claws in. Emily's been through hell.

06:56.814 --> 06:58.847
Yeah, so have you.

06:58.849 --> 07:01.283
Okay, I get what happened
with her sister was awful,

07:01.285 --> 07:04.420
but doesn't mean she gets a free pass.

07:04.422 --> 07:07.122
Maybe that's enough
socialization for one night.

07:07.124 --> 07:09.191
Okay, sure. I'll meet you
outside. Just let me go say bye.

07:11.761 --> 07:15.262
I'm so sick and tired of trying
to fit in with these people.

07:16.398 --> 07:20.668
Thank the non-existent God that in 48 hours

07:20.670 --> 07:21.836
I'll be dead.

07:30.912 --> 07:33.780
We certainly had a difficult
time tracking you down.

07:38.218 --> 07:40.453
Question is, what are we
going to do with you now?

07:40.455 --> 07:42.521
Who are you and what is this place?

07:42.523 --> 07:44.790
It's kind of a rehab
center for people like you.

07:46.259 --> 07:48.661
Look, I'm not saying that
superpowers aren't fun.

07:48.663 --> 07:50.395
Heck, if I was born with them,

07:50.397 --> 07:52.832
I'd probably decorate my walls
with stolen Van Goghs as well.

07:54.468 --> 07:56.668
Of course, I prefer Modernism. Point is...

07:58.370 --> 07:59.804
your kind can't be trusted in our world.

07:59.806 --> 08:01.138
This... this is about the paintings.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.641
Look, I will never teleport
into the Met ever again

08:03.643 --> 08:05.743
and I will never touch
another painting, okay?

08:05.745 --> 08:07.378
I know you won't.

08:09.949 --> 08:12.583
- You gonna kill me?
- Well, that's entirely up to you.

08:13.885 --> 08:15.853
First part is non-negotiable.

08:15.855 --> 08:20.791
Your criminal disposition, your
mediocre powers, are useless to me.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.559
So I'm going to take them away from you.

08:22.561 --> 08:24.461
Return you to the way you used to be.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.196
- Human.
- And the second part?

08:29.399 --> 08:32.234
That you will never breathe a word
of what happens today to anyone,

08:32.236 --> 08:34.336
or, make no mistake, I will kill you.

08:36.172 --> 08:37.172
You believe me?

08:41.945 --> 08:43.211
Give him the shot.

08:44.279 --> 08:45.547
Hey, hey, wait, no.

08:47.249 --> 08:48.383
Ow!

08:55.258 --> 08:57.726
Have you ever seen someone
have their powers taken?

08:59.528 --> 09:00.794
I have.

09:01.863 --> 09:03.463
What do you want me to do?

09:03.465 --> 09:05.766
You said you wanted to be a double agent.

09:05.768 --> 09:06.834
It's game time, baby.

09:07.903 --> 09:09.537
Tim, pull up the schematics.

09:09.539 --> 09:10.738
Yes, Cara.

09:10.890 --> 09:13.290
I've constructed a 3D map of Ultra.

09:14.725 --> 09:16.893
You want me to break into my own office?

09:16.895 --> 09:18.995
A highly restricted part of the facility.

09:18.997 --> 09:20.697
We'll guide you through it, step by step.

09:20.699 --> 09:23.499
And I'll be close enough to be
inside your head the whole time.

09:23.501 --> 09:24.767
And theirs.

09:24.769 --> 09:27.369
- You'll place this drive...
- This dongle.

09:27.371 --> 09:29.138
Inside their firewall.

09:29.140 --> 09:33.441
It'll install software that syncs
up their system directly to Tim.

09:33.443 --> 09:35.410
It'll give us all their
intel on new breakouts.

09:36.913 --> 09:40.849
Ultra is linked into a whole
web of classified material.

09:40.851 --> 09:43.985
Medical files, police
reports, psych records.

09:43.987 --> 09:47.521
They even have their own algorithms
for ID-ing potential paranormals.

09:47.523 --> 09:49.356
It's sort of like an alarm
system that lets them know

09:49.358 --> 09:50.825
if someone's secretly one of us.

09:50.827 --> 09:53.828
Tap into that system, no
more head start for Jedikiah.

09:53.830 --> 09:55.562
Are you excited, Timothy?

09:55.564 --> 09:58.099
You get to stick your
dongle in Ultra's mainframe.

09:58.101 --> 10:01.435
As you know, I'm incapable
of experiencing excitement.

10:01.437 --> 10:04.470
Or appreciating crude sexual innuendo.

10:04.472 --> 10:07.540
Stephen, I know it's dangerous.

10:07.542 --> 10:10.076
If you get caught, it won't matter
that you're Jedikiah's nephew.

10:11.112 --> 10:12.678
But, hey, if you're not ready...

10:14.048 --> 10:15.481
I'm ready.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.452
Cara.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.519
You got a sec?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.523
At this party, it was the first time

10:25.525 --> 10:27.760
that I could hear all of
my classmate's thoughts.

10:27.762 --> 10:29.061
Sucks, doesn't it?

10:29.063 --> 10:30.729
Knowing what's going on
inside people's heads.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.898
Yeah, but...

10:32.900 --> 10:34.566
not just that, there's this girl, Emily.

10:34.568 --> 10:37.101
- She said something disturbing.
- What'd you hear?

10:37.103 --> 10:38.702
"In 48 hours, I'll be dead."

10:39.738 --> 10:41.338
That could mean anything.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.674
Or it could mean, in two
days, she's gonna kill herself.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.877
Even if it did,

10:45.879 --> 10:48.045
we don't use our powers to
intervene in human lives.

10:48.047 --> 10:50.947
- Why not?
- Do you really want to play God?

10:50.949 --> 10:54.651
It's messy, it's complicated
and it risks exposure.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.086
When I was losing it,

10:56.088 --> 10:58.655
I had to go to the nurse
every day to get my pills.

10:58.657 --> 11:00.123
Me and Emily, we were the freaks,

11:00.125 --> 11:01.892
both of us having breakdowns.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.626
Only she had an excuse.

11:03.628 --> 11:05.495
She was behind the wheel of the car

11:05.497 --> 11:06.929
- when her sister got...
- Stephen, stop it.

11:08.731 --> 11:10.432
You dig around in people's minds,

11:10.434 --> 11:13.068
you'll find everyone has a sad story.

11:13.070 --> 11:15.070
You talking from experience?

11:15.072 --> 11:16.738
Not that I'd like to share.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.808
Okay, wait...

11:19.943 --> 11:22.544
So what? We just ignore them?

11:22.546 --> 11:24.879
Forget about their kind.

11:24.881 --> 11:27.081
We'll be lucky if we
can save our own species.

11:34.070 --> 11:41.548
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

11:54.049 --> 11:56.017
Take off your shirt.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.752
Excuse me?

11:57.754 --> 12:00.021
Bio-metric transmitter.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.657
It only works on bare skin.

12:04.193 --> 12:05.860
Okay.

12:05.862 --> 12:07.928
You could buy me dinner first,
I don't even know your name.

12:07.930 --> 12:10.196
Yes you do, it's Agent Nichols.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.600
Got a first name, Agent Nichols?

12:13.602 --> 12:16.069
This isn't some get-to-know-you
luncheon. I'm here to train you.

12:17.838 --> 12:18.972
It's Darcy.

12:20.041 --> 12:21.908
What the hell's the gun for, Darcy?

12:21.910 --> 12:24.109
According to your file, not
only are you naturally gifted

12:24.111 --> 12:27.312
in telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis,

12:27.314 --> 12:28.881
but you can actually stop time.

12:28.883 --> 12:30.182
I don't know how to control it.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.884
Oh, I saw the tape. You did it before.

12:31.886 --> 12:33.418
Yeah, by accident.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.121
Your power is tied into your emotion.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.257
The stronger your emotion,
the stronger your power.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.258
Which is why you were
able to save those kids.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.727
Because you were scared.

12:42.729 --> 12:45.797
Which only follows that,
if I scare you again,

12:45.799 --> 12:47.198
you'll be able to stop time.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.766
- I'm gonna count to three. One...
- Wait, wait, wait...

12:48.768 --> 12:50.167
- Are you serious?
- Two...

12:50.169 --> 12:51.970
- I swear to God.
- Three.

12:56.373 --> 12:57.641
What just happened?

13:00.045 --> 13:03.146
Nothing, except for an
incredibly elevated heart rate.

13:03.148 --> 13:05.048
You just fired a gun at
me. Why aren't I dead?

13:05.050 --> 13:06.349
Oh.

13:06.351 --> 13:07.851
It was loaded with blanks.

13:07.853 --> 13:10.120
Our kind can't kill, remember?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.921
I just had to make you think it was real.

13:13.224 --> 13:17.192
Well, this was...

13:17.194 --> 13:19.695
loads of fun. I'm gonna go grab a water.

13:19.697 --> 13:20.997
Maybe change my shorts.

13:22.198 --> 13:24.934
You do that.

13:24.936 --> 13:27.103
Your partner's a real sweetheart.

13:27.105 --> 13:30.338
- You were in my head for that?
- And hers.

13:30.340 --> 13:33.141
Being a telepath, is like
being a psychic antenna.

13:33.143 --> 13:35.043
That's why I had to get
close enough to help you,

13:35.045 --> 13:36.911
it helps me hear better.

13:36.913 --> 13:39.814
- See that agent?
- Follow him.

13:39.816 --> 13:41.950
He's headed to the restricted section.

13:41.952 --> 13:43.618
Uh, problem. There's a key pad.

13:49.691 --> 13:50.691
Two, two...

13:52.260 --> 13:53.994
six, zero, one.

14:06.707 --> 14:07.807
Now which way to the mainframe?

14:11.045 --> 14:13.012
Left. Go all the way to the end of the...

14:13.014 --> 14:13.980
Wait!

14:15.649 --> 14:17.248
Someone headed your way. Hide.

14:26.826 --> 14:28.226
You're all clear.

14:28.228 --> 14:29.294
Go.

14:37.035 --> 14:38.335
Okay, stop. You're there.

14:40.370 --> 14:42.072
I don't see a mainframe.

14:45.643 --> 14:47.210
Above you. You see that panel?

14:47.212 --> 14:49.045
Third one up. Can you reach it?

14:58.855 --> 15:00.689
It's the primary data
cable for the mainframe.

15:06.097 --> 15:07.763
Damn European tippers.

15:07.765 --> 15:09.297
I can't believe I blew
it with another interview.

15:14.770 --> 15:16.670
Okay, that was easy.

15:16.672 --> 15:18.873
Which way out? Am I clear?

15:23.212 --> 15:24.912
Cara, are you there?

15:34.688 --> 15:36.322
Stephen.

15:36.324 --> 15:38.225
What are you doing here?

15:38.227 --> 15:41.694
Uh... I... I was looking for you.
I wanted to talk to you in private.

15:46.099 --> 15:47.066
Come to my office.

15:48.869 --> 15:52.071
I overheard something
that I wasn't supposed to.

15:52.073 --> 15:54.173
One of my classmates, who's been having

15:54.175 --> 15:57.209
pretty serious mental problems,
is thinking about killing herself.

15:58.278 --> 15:59.245
Oh, that's tragic.

16:01.413 --> 16:04.182
So... I... I should try to help her?

16:04.184 --> 16:06.617
What was it that Stalin once said?

16:06.619 --> 16:08.552
When one man dies it's a tragedy,

16:08.554 --> 16:10.255
when millions die, it's a statistic.

16:12.758 --> 16:14.325
Well, obviously he was a monster.

16:15.327 --> 16:18.095
And he had it backwards.

16:18.097 --> 16:21.198
Because what happens if by using
your powers to help this person,

16:21.200 --> 16:23.333
you accidentally reveal
to the rest of the world

16:23.335 --> 16:25.702
that there's a new species
living amongst them?

16:25.704 --> 16:27.337
One that could read their thoughts,

16:27.339 --> 16:29.773
steal their secrets, prey upon them.

16:31.009 --> 16:33.843
Humans would either try
to exploit you or kill you

16:33.845 --> 16:37.046
and then millions would
die, of your kind and mine.

16:37.048 --> 16:39.282
And that would indeed be a tragedy.

16:39.284 --> 16:40.983
So what does make Emily?

16:43.153 --> 16:44.653
Is she the statistic?

16:45.789 --> 16:47.023
You can't save everybody.

16:57.967 --> 17:00.268
Sweep the fourth floor. Make
sure nothing is out of place.

17:09.644 --> 17:12.612
The great dongler returns!

17:12.614 --> 17:15.950
Good job. Tim's uploading
from Ultra as we speak.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.218
Are you sure you got out clean?

17:18.987 --> 17:21.154
Yeah, yeah. Cara was with
me every step of the way.

17:27.862 --> 17:29.662
Thank you for not making
a big deal in front of...

17:29.664 --> 17:31.764
Actually, it was a big deal.

17:31.766 --> 17:33.099
I almost got caught up there

17:33.101 --> 17:35.101
because of you going mute on
me in the middle of a mission.

17:35.103 --> 17:36.735
What happened?

17:36.737 --> 17:40.739
Sometimes my powers work
a little too well up there.

17:40.741 --> 17:44.042
I can get overwhelmed by all
the noise and I get these...

17:44.044 --> 17:45.344
episodes.

17:45.346 --> 17:46.845
Episodes?

17:47.847 --> 17:50.615
- Must be tough.
- What?

17:50.617 --> 17:52.583
Being stuck down here.

17:52.585 --> 17:54.585
There's a whole world up
there you can't be a part of.

17:55.820 --> 17:56.820
Trust me, Stephen.

17:57.956 --> 17:59.924
I'm happy not being a part of that world.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.226
Cara?

18:24.228 --> 18:25.927
Are you okay?

18:25.929 --> 18:27.463
What happened, honey?

18:29.899 --> 18:32.000
Who? Who did this to you?

18:32.002 --> 18:33.202
Mr. Coburn?

18:36.072 --> 18:38.240
Tell her she's under arrest.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.841
- For what?
- For the murder of Tyler Miller.

18:40.843 --> 18:41.842
Murder?

18:44.179 --> 18:46.247
My daughter says she just shoved him.

18:46.249 --> 18:47.482
She was defending herself.

18:47.484 --> 18:49.417
Yeah, well, it was some shove.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.785
The kid's head was cracked open.

18:51.787 --> 18:53.187
What did you hit him with, a rock?

18:53.189 --> 18:54.822
Where did you hide it?

18:54.824 --> 18:57.390
The truth is going to come out.

18:57.392 --> 19:00.860
Don't waste... can I have a moment
alone with my daughter, please?

19:00.862 --> 19:03.430
Don't worry. Don't
worry. It's gonna be okay.

19:03.432 --> 19:06.233
Sir, you wanna help your daughter?

19:06.235 --> 19:07.967
I suggest you find her an attorney.

19:39.017 --> 19:43.587
4-15, then 5-44, 7-23, 9-16...

19:51.628 --> 19:53.863
So you're, uh... you're stalking Emily now?

19:53.865 --> 19:55.598
No.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.999
Liar.

19:57.001 --> 19:58.968
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

19:58.970 --> 20:00.302
I'm just worried about her.

20:00.304 --> 20:01.971
I think she's been more
depressed than usual.

20:01.973 --> 20:03.673
Oh, and this is based on the, uh,

20:03.675 --> 20:06.108
the 10 seconds of
scintillating conversation

20:06.110 --> 20:09.511
- you *** out of her at the party.
- Not just that. I, um...

20:09.513 --> 20:12.247
I overhead her at the guidance
counselor talking about

20:12.249 --> 20:14.116
the accident and her sister.

20:14.118 --> 20:15.184
That's not cool.

20:15.186 --> 20:17.652
I know, but I heard what I heard.

20:17.654 --> 20:20.489
She's in a dark place and I'm
worried she might try to hurt herself.

20:20.491 --> 20:23.091
- So you stole her notebook.
- I didn't steal it.

20:24.226 --> 20:25.726
Okay, I stole it.

20:25.728 --> 20:27.895
I just needed an excuse
to check in with her.

20:27.897 --> 20:29.097
Make sure she's okay.

20:30.632 --> 20:33.101
Sweet. I mean it's creepy...

20:33.103 --> 20:35.169
but sweet.

20:47.482 --> 20:49.416
Are you doing okay?

20:49.418 --> 20:50.950
Yeah. Why?

20:52.386 --> 20:55.321
Come on. I recognize the look.

20:55.323 --> 20:57.656
It's happening again, isn't it?

20:57.658 --> 21:00.092
I know this time of year is hard.

21:00.094 --> 21:01.627
But you don't have to be so alone.

21:01.629 --> 21:03.629
With your powers, it'd be
so easy to just let me in.

21:03.631 --> 21:06.064
You know damn well there are things
inside your head you don't let me see.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.070
I'm sorry.

21:17.075 --> 21:19.110
It's all ancient history.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.278
Just try and focus on the present.

21:42.266 --> 21:45.434
What is with you all over
me all of a sudden, Jameson?

21:45.436 --> 21:47.037
We, uh, we brought your notebook.

21:48.139 --> 21:51.406
- You dropped it, so I, uh...
- Picked it up?

21:51.408 --> 21:52.541
My hero.

21:55.178 --> 21:56.611
Hold on...

21:56.613 --> 21:58.080
Look, you did your good deed for the day

21:58.082 --> 22:00.949
so you can go check off
your community service hour.

22:00.951 --> 22:02.617
We... we're worried about you.

22:02.619 --> 22:04.186
You're worried about me?

22:04.188 --> 22:06.921
You're the one who's
hanging out with a schizo.

22:06.923 --> 22:09.157
- So what does that make you?
- A friend.

22:11.126 --> 22:12.593
I know about your sister.

22:14.296 --> 22:15.863
And I've lost somebody too.

22:18.500 --> 22:24.370
I didn't lose her. She's not a
set of car keys. I killed her.

22:24.372 --> 22:28.608
I wasn't paying attention. I
didn't even see a train coming.

22:28.610 --> 22:30.944
I killed my little sister, okay?

22:35.282 --> 22:37.249
So, if you're here to tell me that you know

22:37.251 --> 22:38.804
what it feels like to have
your parents look at you

22:38.805 --> 22:39.805
like you're a murderer...

22:40.254 --> 22:43.422
No. No, I just meant that...

22:43.424 --> 22:46.225
we'd like to help you.

22:46.227 --> 22:49.729
Stephen overheard you talking in
the counselor's office accidentally.

22:52.465 --> 22:56.400
That's funny, 'cause I haven't
been to the counselor all year.

22:56.402 --> 22:58.569
So, maybe you're hallucinating again?

23:10.715 --> 23:13.910
Tim, I need you to search
some numbers for me,

23:13.911 --> 23:14.911
see if they mean anything.

23:15.320 --> 23:18.488
5-44, 7-23, and 9-16.

23:18.490 --> 23:20.257
They could signify anything.

23:20.259 --> 23:24.561
Time intervals. Departure or
arrival times for a flight.

23:24.563 --> 23:27.529
- Train, ferry, bus...
- Train.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.866
Train. Emily's sister. Uh...

23:29.868 --> 23:32.037
Search all train schedules.

23:32.038 --> 23:34.466
See if there's a line
that hits those times.

23:36.706 --> 23:38.274
No matches.

23:38.276 --> 23:42.010
- You checked everything?
- I am a supercomputer.

23:45.848 --> 23:47.715
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

23:47.717 --> 23:50.685
This doesn't have anything to
do with your friend at school.

23:50.687 --> 23:52.720
The one who's mind your reading?

23:52.722 --> 23:56.258
- We do not help humans.
- Yes, thank you, I already got the lecture.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.759
Then I don't need to explain
why it's not worth the risk.

23:58.761 --> 24:00.895
I risked my ass for you guys.

24:00.897 --> 24:02.115
I hacked into Ultra's mainframe

24:02.116 --> 24:04.926
to help your species
track down new breakouts.

24:04.934 --> 24:07.434
It's your species too, Stephen.

24:07.436 --> 24:10.537
And I almost got caught thanks to whatever
the hell's going on inside your brain.

24:10.539 --> 24:11.598
But just because you can't deal

24:11.599 --> 24:13.740
or don't give a damn about
humans, doesn't mean...

24:13.809 --> 24:16.176
What's he talkin' about?

24:17.945 --> 24:19.913
You're right.

24:19.915 --> 24:21.559
The real reason not to help these people

24:21.560 --> 24:23.140
isn't because it's reckless.

24:24.102 --> 24:25.101
It's pointless.

24:26.604 --> 24:28.171
They don't deserve saving.

24:28.173 --> 24:30.973
- You don't mean that.
- The people you love,

24:30.975 --> 24:33.709
they don't know the truth about you.

24:33.711 --> 24:39.081
If, when, they discover there's
a freak living in their midst,

24:39.083 --> 24:40.707
then you'll find out who they really are...

24:41.786 --> 24:42.738
Sorry to interrupt,

24:42.739 --> 24:45.462
but I just received an
alert via Ultra's mainframe.

24:46.322 --> 24:48.308
- It worked.
- It seems there's a breakout

24:48.359 --> 24:50.849
- in the vicinity of the navy yard.
- You got an ID?

24:50.860 --> 24:53.095
Facial recognition coming through.

24:56.592 --> 24:59.761
Tim's put us ahead of Ultra
on a new breakout. Let's move.

24:59.763 --> 25:02.196
I didn't get any kind of
telepathic read on this girl.

25:02.198 --> 25:04.731
Maybe that's 'cause your
powers are fritzing out.

25:04.733 --> 25:08.102
Russel and I can handle this
if you're not feeling 0%0%.

25:08.104 --> 25:09.603
Stop coddling me, I'm fine

25:11.540 --> 25:14.141
- You're not going anywhere.
- Why not?

25:14.143 --> 25:16.017
You're the inside man at Ultra.

25:16.018 --> 25:18.149
We can't risk you being exposed.

25:22.349 --> 25:23.972
Dark-haired female,

25:23.973 --> 25:27.373
5'6. Exhibiting paranormal
powers somewhere in the vicinity.

25:27.489 --> 25:30.390
What a craphole. Why would
a breakout want to hang here?

25:30.392 --> 25:33.392
She's probably confused.
Wants to stow away on a ship.

25:33.394 --> 25:37.896
Get as far away from home
home as fast as possible.

25:37.898 --> 25:42.767
I have to get out of here before
they figure out I'm a freak.

25:42.769 --> 25:45.637
- I got her. She's here.
- We'll cover you.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.530
Please don't make me go home.

25:50.531 --> 25:53.172
You don't know what they did to me.

25:53.346 --> 25:56.280
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

25:57.682 --> 25:59.617
Hey! It's me, we have to go.

26:02.621 --> 26:04.121
I don't think so.

26:44.783 --> 26:46.917
They took her! We gotta jet!

26:51.290 --> 26:52.789
We can't help her if we're dead!

27:06.122 --> 27:08.123
- They got her.
- We don't know that.

27:08.125 --> 27:09.925
Maybe she bolted with the breakout.

27:09.927 --> 27:11.894
There was no breakout,
it was a damned trap.

27:11.896 --> 27:14.029
Jedikiah must have found our drive.

27:14.031 --> 27:15.141
I never should have let her go up top,

27:15.142 --> 27:16.142
not in the state she was in.

27:16.143 --> 27:18.076
Wait, what do you mean?

27:18.168 --> 27:19.448
The night Cara broke out,

27:19.449 --> 27:21.811
this bastard attacked
her, tried to rape her.

27:22.005 --> 27:23.240
Cara fought back.

27:23.241 --> 27:25.001
That's how she discovered she had powers.

27:25.008 --> 27:26.890
That was five years ago exactly.

27:26.891 --> 27:29.295
This time of year is always rough.

27:29.546 --> 27:31.746
It's like she's reliving it all over again.

27:31.748 --> 27:34.047
- So, what do we do now?
- What do you think we do?

27:34.049 --> 27:36.883
- We go in...
- No, they'll be ready for us.

27:36.885 --> 27:38.652
We don't have a choice.

27:38.654 --> 27:40.954
They're gonna kill her.

27:40.956 --> 27:42.556
Stay here.

27:42.558 --> 27:43.524
Stephen.

27:44.526 --> 27:46.460
I'm gonna get her.

27:46.462 --> 27:48.195
I'm the inside man, remember?

27:54.234 --> 27:55.935
Jedikiah.

27:57.137 --> 27:58.137
Hmm.

28:00.173 --> 28:04.509
Power suppression
restraints. Very effective.

28:04.511 --> 28:05.811
How'd you get her?

28:07.980 --> 28:09.414
Familiar?

28:10.717 --> 28:12.317
What is it?

28:12.319 --> 28:14.519
Just something that
mysteriously found its way

28:14.520 --> 28:16.655
into my computer system
after you came on board.

28:18.090 --> 28:19.725
I've never seen it before.

28:23.662 --> 28:26.446
Get Darcy to give me another one
of your telepathic brain scans

28:26.447 --> 28:27.447
if you don't believe me.

28:28.734 --> 28:31.935
No, I prefer to take you at your word.

28:31.937 --> 28:33.588
Learning otherwise would, of course,

28:33.589 --> 28:35.292
put you in the same boat
as your friend there.

28:35.842 --> 28:37.574
What are you gonna do to her?

28:37.576 --> 28:39.576
I mean, you can't kill her.

28:39.578 --> 28:43.179
I certainly can. Easily.

28:43.181 --> 28:44.647
She's useless.

28:45.983 --> 28:47.950
But impressive.

28:47.952 --> 28:49.595
Our best telepath

28:49.596 --> 28:52.252
could not retrieve a shred
of intel on her compatriots.

28:54.424 --> 28:56.224
Jedikiah...

28:56.226 --> 28:59.628
Please. Don't do it.

28:59.630 --> 29:01.830
Well, you seem awfully attached.

29:02.965 --> 29:04.700
Cara helped me.

29:04.702 --> 29:06.133
When I thought I was going nuts,

29:06.134 --> 29:08.829
her voice kept me from falling apart.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.805
I owe her.

29:10.807 --> 29:13.741
You do know that she's a murderer.

29:13.743 --> 29:16.844
A fugitive. Unrepentant.

29:16.846 --> 29:19.595
I'm sorry, Stephen, I can't justify it.

29:19.596 --> 29:20.371
I'm gonna have to put her down.

29:20.372 --> 29:22.583
What if you just take away her powers?

29:22.585 --> 29:24.418
She would be harmless.

29:24.420 --> 29:27.120
Now, why would I let her off that easy?

29:27.122 --> 29:29.923
Because of John. He's in love with her.

29:29.925 --> 29:31.622
You take away her powers,

29:31.623 --> 29:34.009
you turn her into the thing he hates.

29:34.011 --> 29:35.710
Human.

29:35.712 --> 29:38.847
Without her telepathy,
she's useless to him.

29:44.052 --> 29:47.220
I can't tell if your being
sadistic or self-serving.

29:50.291 --> 29:51.959
If you don't believe me...

29:53.928 --> 29:56.829
why don't you let me
give her the injection?

30:13.846 --> 30:14.980
So, now what?

30:16.849 --> 30:17.983
I'm gonna get you out of here.

30:22.221 --> 30:24.355
- What are you doing?
- It's the only way.

30:24.357 --> 30:26.158
No, Stephen, no!

30:26.160 --> 30:28.393
I'm sorry, the best I can do is
to give you your old life back.

30:28.395 --> 30:31.428
No, you don't understand what
it was like for me to be human.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.699
No, you don't understand. If I don't
do this, they're gonna kill you.

30:34.701 --> 30:36.233
Stephen, I can't...

30:36.235 --> 30:38.002
I can't go back to who I was.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.040
I'm sorry.

30:46.343 --> 30:47.744
Kill me.

30:50.214 --> 30:51.681
Just kill me.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.149
No.

30:53.151 --> 30:55.218
You are a survivor, Cara.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.285
You will find a way.

30:57.287 --> 30:59.189
No, don't.

31:03.694 --> 31:05.861
No, don't, Stephen!

31:47.560 --> 31:48.593
Cara.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.568
Yeah?

31:57.570 --> 31:59.203
Nothin'.

31:59.205 --> 32:02.440
I just didn't know you
were such a good actress.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.275
How'd you know you could do it again?

32:07.079 --> 32:08.278
I didn't.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.281
I just hoped I could.

32:12.350 --> 32:14.084
No. No.

32:15.386 --> 32:18.188
No, don't, Stephen!

32:28.031 --> 32:29.631
Oh, my God, Stephen.

32:29.633 --> 32:33.469
Okay. I'm gonna inject you with saline.

32:34.670 --> 32:37.206
Are you a good actress?

32:37.208 --> 32:39.274
'Cause you need to give the
performance of your life here.

32:39.276 --> 32:40.641
Thank you.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.011
Ready?

32:49.318 --> 32:50.951
He saved my life.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.588
When Ultra had me, I thought...

32:54.590 --> 32:55.689
Hey.

32:57.191 --> 32:59.192
You're safe now.

32:59.194 --> 33:01.061
What about Stephen?

33:01.063 --> 33:03.497
If Jedikiah ever sees
me using my powers again,

33:03.499 --> 33:04.631
you know what will happen to him.

33:05.966 --> 33:07.434
He made that choice himself.

33:09.470 --> 33:11.271
I would have done the same thing.

33:17.511 --> 33:19.178
I'm just glad I got you back.

33:22.015 --> 33:23.315
Me too.

33:26.520 --> 33:29.220
I'm serious, man, you gotta
teach me how to do that.

33:29.222 --> 33:32.157
There's still a few casinos
I haven't been banned from.

33:32.159 --> 33:34.125
We could do some major damage!

33:34.127 --> 33:35.626
Pardon me for interrupting.

33:35.628 --> 33:37.461
Oh, Tim! We are having a moment.

33:37.463 --> 33:40.597
But are you aware you have
12 missed calls, Stephen?

33:40.599 --> 33:43.267
I believe the eager young
woman's name is Astrid.

33:43.269 --> 33:46.103
How do you know that? My phone
doesn't even work down here.

33:46.105 --> 33:48.372
Never mind, you're a supercomputer.

33:48.374 --> 33:50.274
Hmm. Who's Astrid?

33:50.276 --> 33:52.434
We blocked all cell
reception a long time ago.

33:52.435 --> 33:53.831
Security measures.

33:53.945 --> 33:55.644
I just opened a line for you now.

33:55.646 --> 33:57.513
Thank you.

34:00.016 --> 34:02.085
- Hi.
- Hey, it's me.

34:02.087 --> 34:04.087
Yeah, look, it's Emily.
Nobody can find her.

34:04.089 --> 34:06.055
Um... her mom has been calling everybody.

34:06.057 --> 34:09.190
I think you were right.
She's hiding something.

34:09.193 --> 34:12.527
Her mom said that this last week,
she's totally shut down on them.

34:12.529 --> 34:14.728
When did her sister die?
Do you remember the date?

34:14.731 --> 34:19.101
I think it was around now.
You don't think she's gonna...

34:19.103 --> 34:22.170
Yeah, it's the anniversary.
Astrid, I'm sorry, I gotta go.

34:22.172 --> 34:25.272
Tim, those numbers I gave you
didn't match any train schedules?

34:25.274 --> 34:26.639
That is correct, Stephen.

34:26.641 --> 34:28.675
What about the time intervals?

34:28.677 --> 34:32.679
That is interesting. They
match the Westbound blue line.

34:32.681 --> 34:35.516
Only the times are off
by exactly three minutes.

34:35.518 --> 34:37.585
That's 'cause she's not
planning on hopping a train,

34:37.587 --> 34:39.286
she's planning on getting hit by one.

34:42.356 --> 34:45.324
Emily's been obsessing about
dying the same way her sister did.

34:45.327 --> 34:47.159
I don't care about your
rules, I gotta stop her.

34:47.161 --> 34:49.596
- No, Stephen, you can't.
- Why the hell not?

34:49.598 --> 34:51.664
Stephen, this girl knows you.

34:51.666 --> 34:54.934
You'll risk exposing yourself if
you use your powers in front of her.

34:54.936 --> 34:58.170
- I'll go.
- Cara. I almost lost you once today.

34:58.172 --> 35:00.405
I can do this, John.

35:00.407 --> 35:01.440
Trust me.

35:22.628 --> 35:24.629
Between the three of us,
I think we can TK the car.

35:24.631 --> 35:26.430
Too risky.

35:26.432 --> 35:28.498
Wait... Cara!

35:28.500 --> 35:31.067
It's okay. She's got this.

35:33.003 --> 35:34.103
I'm sorry.

35:35.540 --> 35:36.673
I'm so sorry.

35:40.646 --> 35:43.547
- Hey.
- What the hell? What are you doing?

35:43.549 --> 35:45.481
I might ask you the same question.

35:45.483 --> 35:48.651
Are you crazy? Get out!

35:48.653 --> 35:49.985
No.

35:53.990 --> 35:56.958
Do you think this is what
your sister would've wanted?

35:56.960 --> 35:59.328
How do you know about my sister?

35:59.330 --> 36:01.362
You don't understand. Everybody
blames me. My parents...

36:01.364 --> 36:03.864
What happened was an accident.

36:05.267 --> 36:07.468
Killing yourself is not
going to bring her back.

36:13.175 --> 36:15.976
I know what it's like to see someone's face

36:15.978 --> 36:17.477
every time you close your eyes.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.915
Killing yourself is not
gonna settle the score.

36:48.541 --> 36:50.375
What'd you say?

36:52.378 --> 36:54.613
We should go before she sees you.

37:21.185 --> 37:22.451
Emily.

37:25.789 --> 37:27.623
What do you think'll happen?

37:28.725 --> 37:31.761
Let's hope it's a wake-up call.

37:31.763 --> 37:35.197
Maybe now they can all
stop living in the past.

37:35.199 --> 37:36.298
Moment of truth.

37:43.306 --> 37:45.440
I hope Emily knows how lucky she is.

37:45.442 --> 37:48.043
A mystery woman just
talked her off the edge.

37:48.045 --> 37:49.576
I think she's feeling pretty lucky.

37:51.579 --> 37:53.480
I meant that she gets to go home.

37:53.482 --> 37:55.549
Something I can never do.

37:56.751 --> 37:58.085
What happened?

37:59.554 --> 38:01.255
I wanna show you something.

38:01.257 --> 38:03.557
Something I've never shared with anyone.

38:12.967 --> 38:13.967
Yeah?

38:15.236 --> 38:16.669
Cara?

38:16.671 --> 38:18.405
What are you doing here?

38:20.074 --> 38:21.740
Dad...

38:24.010 --> 38:25.744
I can hear.

38:27.247 --> 38:31.783
What do you mean, you can hear?
That doesn't make any sense.

38:31.785 --> 38:34.653
Cara, a boy is dead.

38:34.655 --> 38:38.489
That boy, do you know who his father is?

38:38.491 --> 38:41.659
No one's gonna believe
that you're innocent.

38:41.661 --> 38:46.130
No one's gonna believe
that you suddenly can hear.

38:46.132 --> 38:49.033
Look, you want a life,

38:49.035 --> 38:51.802
then you turn around and you go.

38:51.804 --> 38:55.072
And you never come back here. Ever.

38:55.074 --> 38:56.340
Cara.

39:05.317 --> 39:08.018
This is the best I can do.

39:08.020 --> 39:10.586
Take this and go.

39:13.323 --> 39:15.524
We'll be better off without her.

39:17.527 --> 39:21.130
Cara. Go.

39:36.545 --> 39:38.013
Cara!

39:49.624 --> 39:50.590
Bye.

40:03.070 --> 40:04.737
I'm sorry, Cara.

40:04.739 --> 40:07.206
I had no idea.

40:07.208 --> 40:08.508
It's okay.

40:10.844 --> 40:12.711
You can't change what happened.

40:12.713 --> 40:14.646
No.

40:14.648 --> 40:17.615
You also don't have to let it define you.

40:17.617 --> 40:19.784
Maybe we were given
these powers for a reason.

40:19.786 --> 40:22.718
You know? Our being able
to help people like Emily,

40:22.719 --> 40:23.719
it's not playing God.

40:24.357 --> 40:25.756
It's just being human.

40:27.625 --> 40:31.228
You're a real cup's-half-full
kinda guy, aren't you?

40:32.697 --> 40:34.165
I like that.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.633
You did good today.

40:37.635 --> 40:38.768
Really good.

40:47.311 --> 40:50.646
Hey! You scared the crap out of me.

40:51.648 --> 40:53.248
Sorry.

40:55.351 --> 40:57.786
Anything you wanna say to me?

40:57.788 --> 41:00.522
Uh, yeah. Text me before
you show up in my room

41:00.524 --> 41:03.559
like something out of Paranormal Activity.

41:03.561 --> 41:04.759
Anything else?

41:07.063 --> 41:08.397
About Emily, maybe?

41:09.731 --> 41:13.033
Um... yeah. I'm sorry I hung up on you.

41:13.035 --> 41:15.570
I just heard that she's fine.

41:15.572 --> 41:20.408
You know she's fine. You
were at the train tracks.

41:20.410 --> 41:25.079
And then, all of a sudden,
you were just... not.

41:27.582 --> 41:32.619
I... I appreciate the credit, but
I wasn't anywhere near a train.

41:34.255 --> 41:36.723
You're really gonna stand
there and lie to my face?

41:38.293 --> 41:40.260
Astrid...

41:40.262 --> 41:41.460
I'm onto you.

41:44.131 --> 41:45.564
And if you don't wanna tell me the truth,

41:45.566 --> 41:48.134
I will go figure it out for myself.
