00:00.180 --> 00:01.520
Previously on Good Trouble...

00:01.540 --> 00:03.440
Tell us what it's like,
working at Speckulate.

00:03.460 --> 00:04.560
The culture sucks.

00:04.570 --> 00:06.440
You always have the best ideas.

00:06.460 --> 00:09.040
Do you really think trying to kiss me

00:09.060 --> 00:11.320
wouldn't make you look
like you're full of crap?

00:11.380 --> 00:13.900
_

00:13.940 --> 00:16.260
I thought I could do this
casual thing with you,

00:16.280 --> 00:17.799
but I don't want to
share you with anyone.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.460
Excuse me, do you know Dennis?

00:19.470 --> 00:23.050
I'm Jennifer, Dennis'
soon to be ex-wife.

00:23.060 --> 00:25.520
You told your friends I'm
clerking the Jamal case?

00:25.540 --> 00:27.400
No one's supposed to know
what cases I'm working on.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.280
Did you see the way Callie
was looking at that girl?

00:29.300 --> 00:30.309
I think they know each other.

00:30.310 --> 00:32.380
Tate Wilson was arrested
a few weeks back

00:32.390 --> 00:35.000
charged with DUI and
assaulting a police officer.

00:35.020 --> 00:36.299
But it happened up in Berkeley,

00:36.300 --> 00:39.000
so no conflict or interest
with the police down here.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.300

01:00.180 --> 01:03.020
Coffee. Coffee, coffee, coffee.

01:07.430 --> 01:10.380
You realize the compromising
position you're putting me in?

01:10.390 --> 01:11.540
Professionally,

01:11.580 --> 01:14.380
not to mention the grief that
you've caused me and your mother.

01:14.390 --> 01:16.060
What about the grief you caused me?

01:16.100 --> 01:17.900
What the hell have I ever done to you?

01:18.390 --> 01:20.090
Beyond putting a roof over your head

01:20.100 --> 01:21.920
or, or food in your mouth.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.900
Not to mention paying
for private schooling.

01:23.940 --> 01:26.880
Every little thing that you ever wanted.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.310
Well, maybe what I wanted
was a father who was there.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.080
Who wasn't working all the time.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.240
I worked to provide for my family.

01:35.270 --> 01:36.800
No, no, you worked for this.

01:36.810 --> 01:39.590
For, for a lifetime
appointment to play God.

01:39.620 --> 01:40.630
It wasn't enough.

01:40.650 --> 01:43.220
You judged every little
thing I ever said or did.

01:43.230 --> 01:47.050
You needed a stage to
impose your intellectual

01:47.060 --> 01:48.720
and moral authority on the world.

01:48.730 --> 01:50.060
Right, right, right.
So while I'm to blame

01:50.080 --> 01:51.850
for you partying your ass off in college

01:51.860 --> 01:55.200
and failing out, not to mention
getting arrested for a DUI.

01:55.220 --> 01:56.720
And taking a swing

01:56.730 --> 01:57.740
at a police officer!

01:57.750 --> 01:59.590
That is all my fault!

01:59.600 --> 02:01.500
Isn't it?

02:01.550 --> 02:02.600
Forget it.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.550
No, you were a perfect father

02:05.560 --> 02:06.940
and I'm just a screw-up.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.460
Sorry you have to work for an asshole.

02:38.930 --> 02:41.340
I hope you like milk and sugar.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.940
Yeah, any coffee's good coffee.

02:48.140 --> 02:51.140
Especially when my barista's so hot.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.200
Thank you.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.630
H-He...

03:22.640 --> 03:27.900
He would tell me about sex
dreams that he had about me...

03:27.940 --> 03:30.720
and what we were doing in them,

03:30.730 --> 03:32.880
what I was doing to him.

03:32.890 --> 03:35.920
He would brush up against me,

03:35.930 --> 03:37.260
stand too close.

03:37.270 --> 03:41.760
I asked him to stop and he
said he was just kidding

03:41.770 --> 03:44.380
and that I shouldn't be so uptight.

03:44.390 --> 03:48.220
And then I finally reported
everything to Human Resources

03:48.240 --> 03:51.960
and a few days later, I was let go.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.140
With no explanation.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.220
She has no case.

03:59.230 --> 04:00.300
You don't believe her?

04:00.310 --> 04:01.670
It doesn't matter if I believe her,

04:01.680 --> 04:03.090
she can't prove the harassment,

04:03.100 --> 04:05.720
or that she was retaliated
against for reporting it.

04:05.850 --> 04:08.760
The company has evidence that
she doctored her timecards

04:08.770 --> 04:10.800
and was late to work multiple times.

04:10.810 --> 04:11.940
Then why didn't they fire her

04:11.960 --> 04:13.960
until after she reported the harassment?

04:13.970 --> 04:16.050
Don't you think the timing's
a little suspicious?

04:16.060 --> 04:18.899
Not according to Brooks
v. City of San Mateo,

04:18.910 --> 04:21.670
which I'm going to cite as
precedent in my bench memo.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.860
As a woman,

04:22.880 --> 04:25.050
don't you think you owe her
the benefit of the doubt?

04:25.060 --> 04:26.510
As the clerk on this case,

04:26.520 --> 04:28.800
I owe the judge a recommendation
based on the law.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.220
Not as a feminist.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.390
Ha, you're a feminist?

04:32.520 --> 04:35.670
Yes, conservative women
can be feminists.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.170
While working toward
limiting women's rights?

04:38.180 --> 04:39.300
Let's not go there.

04:39.310 --> 04:42.050
Okay, so, you ladies going
to Clerk Cocktails tonight?

04:42.060 --> 04:43.760
Callie, you're kind of expected to go,

04:43.770 --> 04:45.760
- represent your judge.
- Where is it this time?

04:45.770 --> 04:47.310
Some bar called "Douro."

04:48.350 --> 04:49.380
Douro?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.670
That's funny, I was there last night.

04:51.680 --> 04:52.770
It's nice.

04:55.200 --> 04:59.760
_

04:59.810 --> 05:03.440
_

05:06.730 --> 05:08.700
_

05:08.720 --> 05:11.240
Glad you got to see my office
before you leave tomorrow.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.550
This is ridiculous.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.060
You're telling me that
you're allowed to have

05:14.090 --> 05:15.840
whatever you want whenever you want it?

05:15.850 --> 05:17.590
Like, there's full-time baristas here?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.440
Oh, you've got a ping-pong table!

05:19.470 --> 05:22.120
You got the, the sliding thing
that's for rich people.

05:22.140 --> 05:23.520
You got a rock wall!

05:23.960 --> 05:26.160
How do you even do work
with a VR headset on?

05:26.170 --> 05:27.180
Okay, look, it's great

05:27.200 --> 05:30.320
if you can ignore the racism,
sexism, and general oppression.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.410
Well, just tell me whose
ass I'm kicking first.

05:32.420 --> 05:33.540
You're not kicking anyone's ass

05:33.550 --> 05:34.750
although I'd love to watch.

05:34.760 --> 05:37.680
Alex, Sam, Raj, this is
my twin brother, Jesus.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.120
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.290
Hey, man, really nice to meet you.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.250
Oh, firm handshake there.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.250
So, Jesus, what do you do?

05:45.260 --> 05:47.120
Oh, I'm a contractor.

05:47.130 --> 05:48.700
- Wait, you build stuff?
- Mm-hmm.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.000
- With your hands?
- Yeah.

05:51.010 --> 05:52.410
Very cool.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.800
Yeah, yeah, very cool.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.480
Hey, they don't seem that bad.

05:59.940 --> 06:01.060
Excuse me.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.800
Ah, Angela, what brings you by?

06:02.810 --> 06:06.080
Well, something has been
brought to my attention

06:06.140 --> 06:09.140
and I need to speak with you, Mariana.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.670
Right now?

06:11.680 --> 06:12.730
Yes.

06:17.020 --> 06:20.960
Welcome to the first meeting of
the Women of Tech Fight Club.

06:20.970 --> 06:24.140
Or as I like to call it, "Byte Club."

06:25.520 --> 06:27.480
Get it? Like B-Y-T-E.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.630
No, too cute? Okay.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.880
Um, anyways,

06:31.890 --> 06:33.160
thank you all for coming.

06:33.350 --> 06:36.520
So... what kind of place is this?

06:36.540 --> 06:38.300
It's like a commune?

06:38.340 --> 06:41.300
No, it's an intentional living space,

06:41.310 --> 06:42.800
not a commune.

06:43.390 --> 06:46.120
Anyways, the purpose of this club

06:46.140 --> 06:49.340
is to have a safe space
to vent and discuss ways

06:49.360 --> 06:50.420
in which we can support each other...

06:50.430 --> 06:52.220
So, everyone shares a bathroom?

06:53.660 --> 06:55.050
Yeah.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.230
So, who would like to start?

07:09.220 --> 07:10.920
Maybe we should open some wine first?

07:14.180 --> 07:16.840
So, after pretending he needed my help,

07:16.860 --> 07:18.460
and telling me how smart I was,

07:18.470 --> 07:20.120
he tried to kiss me!

07:20.230 --> 07:22.340
Was it Josh?

07:22.350 --> 07:23.420
I'm not naming names,

07:23.430 --> 07:25.400
but thank you for the heads up on Josh.

07:25.420 --> 07:27.420
My first year at Speckulate,

07:27.430 --> 07:28.840
they called me "Double A."

07:28.850 --> 07:30.580
For "Affirmative Action."

07:30.600 --> 07:32.440
Anytime I identify a problem,

07:32.470 --> 07:34.100
they tell me to calm down.

07:34.140 --> 07:35.380
"Don't get hysterical."

07:35.400 --> 07:37.280
- "Will you take notes?"
- "Man up."

07:37.300 --> 07:38.429
"You should smile more."

07:38.430 --> 07:40.120
- "Tidy up."
- "Oh, don't be so bossy!"

07:40.140 --> 07:41.460
"Are you sure you can handle that?"

07:41.470 --> 07:42.800
- "Shrill."
- "Ambitious."

07:42.810 --> 07:44.720
It's like they literally
can't hear me speak.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.060
Exactly!

07:46.120 --> 07:48.220
And that's it for Blue Team.

07:48.230 --> 07:49.550
Um, actually, I have an update...

07:49.560 --> 07:50.800
Read Team, what do you have?

07:50.810 --> 07:52.400
No, excuse me. I have...

07:52.560 --> 07:53.720
I have an update.

07:53.730 --> 07:54.920
Is there more from Blue?

07:54.930 --> 07:57.180
- Yes.
- No, we're all good.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.220
Moving on!

07:58.240 --> 07:59.630
Yellow Team, what do you got?

07:59.640 --> 08:01.180
We were able to manage peak performance

08:01.200 --> 08:02.360
better by prioritizing.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.780
This was such a great idea.

08:04.800 --> 08:05.900
Yeah, it feels good to vent.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.920
And it's not that I don't love my job,

08:07.930 --> 08:10.550
it just sucks watching dudes
who play video games all day

08:10.560 --> 08:11.640
get credit for your work.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.630
- And probably paid more.
- Hmm.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.480
So, let's do more than just vent.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.720
We need to find a way to be heard.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.840
A way to fight back.

08:20.850 --> 08:22.800
I need to speak with you, Mariana.

08:22.810 --> 08:24.670
- Right now?
- Yes.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.300
Uh, can we talk in your office?

08:27.310 --> 08:30.350
No, I want everyone to hear this.

08:36.929 --> 08:38.919
My buddy, Wyatt and I build tree houses,

08:38.929 --> 08:40.760
but work is kinda slow.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.550
Moms actually think that I should
go work for another contractor.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.600
Well, maybe you should.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.420
You know, until things take off.

08:47.430 --> 08:48.759
No, I like working for myself.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.360
Sometimes you have to
start from the bottom,

08:50.390 --> 08:51.650
and work your way up to the top.

08:51.660 --> 08:52.670
Why?

08:53.470 --> 08:54.880
I say "Stay true to yourself."

08:54.890 --> 08:56.170
Don't compromise, man.

08:56.180 --> 08:57.460
I did that my whole life.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.670
You know, did what was expected.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.800
I went to college, got
the corporate job.

09:00.810 --> 09:02.020
You had a corporate job?

09:02.100 --> 09:03.630
Yeah, and I hated it!

09:03.640 --> 09:05.800
And look where you are now!

09:05.810 --> 09:08.010
Davia! This is Jesus!

09:08.020 --> 09:09.840
- Oh. Hi!
- Hi.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.420
Look, I may not have much,

09:11.440 --> 09:13.460
but I'm following my bliss
and I got everything I need.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.880
Bliss don't pay the bills.

09:15.850 --> 09:17.720
You know what? I actually have an idea.

09:17.730 --> 09:19.800
I wanna build tiny houses.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.760
Cause there's this housing
crisis in California, right?

09:22.770 --> 09:24.590
And San Diego is allowing contractors

09:24.600 --> 09:27.050
to build four tiny houses on one lot.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.590
Makin' a ton of money, too.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.590
I would love a tiny house.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.630
For my shoes.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.550
The only problem is

09:33.560 --> 09:35.680
that I would need a really big loan.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.800
Or like an investor to come and buy
property and all the materials.

09:38.810 --> 09:41.010
Jesus, you've never built a house before

09:41.020 --> 09:42.090
that wasn't in a tree.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.500
Yeah, I know.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.740
But I think I could figure it out.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.010
Once the coconut's on...

09:47.020 --> 09:48.050
straight into the oven.

09:48.060 --> 09:49.670
Voila!

09:49.680 --> 09:52.050
- Ooh!
- That is raw.

09:52.060 --> 09:54.620
Good. I'm on a raw diet.

09:54.850 --> 09:56.010
So, why are we baking?

09:56.020 --> 09:58.140
Oh! I have a presentation tomorrow,

09:58.170 --> 09:59.520
and if I bring in baked goods,

09:59.550 --> 10:01.600
the men's attention will
be on me right away.

10:01.620 --> 10:03.660
Or you could just not wear a bra.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.800
So, who wants to get a drink?

10:07.880 --> 10:10.130
- I wanna check out LA.
- Yeah. Me.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.670
Sorry. I have to work.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.080
Yeah, it's getting kinda
late, but you guys go ahead.

10:14.140 --> 10:15.240
Are you sure?

10:15.270 --> 10:16.420
- Course.
- Yeah.

10:16.430 --> 10:18.050
All right, we'll go down to my loft,

10:18.060 --> 10:19.340
grab my jacket,

10:19.370 --> 10:20.720
down a couple of shots.

10:20.860 --> 10:22.760
Game plan.

10:22.770 --> 10:24.550
I'm in for the night,

10:24.560 --> 10:26.380
but thanks for asking, Dennis.

10:30.460 --> 10:31.920
So, Callie...

10:32.000 --> 10:34.540
what happened with you and Gael?

10:34.850 --> 10:36.670
Why are you asking?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.540
Well, according to Bryan,

10:38.570 --> 10:40.740
they're exclusive now.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.090
Oh, like "married" exclusive?

10:44.100 --> 10:45.760
Like your boyfriend?

10:45.880 --> 10:47.180
I gotta work.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.040
- You had that one coming.
- I didn't know she had it in her.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.880
The layout is... is really open.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.050
So, it doesn't even feel tiny.

10:59.060 --> 11:00.100
Okay, there's no patio,

11:00.120 --> 11:02.340
but if you put a living
roof up on the top,

11:02.350 --> 11:04.090
then you have an outdoor space.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.800
You know...

11:05.810 --> 11:07.650
I might know a guy who'd
be interested in this.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.670
- Really?
- From my days in finance.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.130
He funds a lot of entrepreneurs.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.510
That would be awesome.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.980
- Let me text him.
- Sure. Please!

11:35.300 --> 11:36.670
Mmm! These are delicious!

11:36.680 --> 11:37.780
Thank you!

11:37.800 --> 11:39.420
All right, all right, all right!

11:39.430 --> 11:40.840
Let's get this bitch started.

11:40.850 --> 11:44.160
Okay, Blue Team. What's the word?

11:44.240 --> 11:46.960
All systems go on the
social network project.

11:46.970 --> 11:49.640
Should have some preliminary
code to you by Friday.

11:49.660 --> 11:51.590
Good, that's what I like
to hear. Red Team!

11:51.600 --> 11:54.220
- And, um, I'm sorry, but, I, uh...
- Please.

11:54.230 --> 11:56.510
Red Team, what's the
word on development?

11:56.520 --> 11:59.540
When speaking in a meeting, no
"um's" or "sorry's" allowed.

11:59.570 --> 12:00.580
Get to the point,

12:00.600 --> 12:01.850
and if you speak with authority,

12:01.860 --> 12:03.010
they won't be able to ignore you.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.510
Excuse me, Josh,

12:04.520 --> 12:05.720
I have an update on maintenance

12:05.730 --> 12:06.739
that I'd like to share.

12:06.740 --> 12:08.660
We need to improve our
connections model,

12:08.680 --> 12:10.510
and dig into image/audio recognition,

12:10.520 --> 12:11.840
and rank possible
connections based on...

12:11.850 --> 12:14.320
Yeah, our connections model review
can wait until the next scrum,

12:14.340 --> 12:15.350
at which time, we'll...

12:15.370 --> 12:17.220
How do we deal with
the "man-terrupters"?

12:17.230 --> 12:20.170
I read that if you sit
up straight or stand,

12:20.180 --> 12:23.420
that sort of non-verbal
assertiveness is non-threatening.

12:23.430 --> 12:25.220
- ... at that time...
- Actually, Josh,

12:25.230 --> 12:27.300
our connections model needs
immediate attention,

12:27.310 --> 12:30.260
because we are losing hundreds of
users a week to competitive apps.

12:30.270 --> 12:31.980
You know, I was thinking
we should look into

12:32.000 --> 12:34.460
our image/audio to improve recognition.

12:34.470 --> 12:38.050
And maybe rank our connections
based on content quality?

12:38.060 --> 12:39.220
That's a good idea, Sam.

12:39.230 --> 12:41.170
What do we do about the "himitator?"

12:41.180 --> 12:42.510
The guy who says what you just said,

12:42.520 --> 12:43.739
and everyone thinks it was his idea?

12:43.740 --> 12:44.749
Yes, Sam.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.080
Thank you so much for agreeing
with everything I just said.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.720
- What?
- No, I don't think

12:48.740 --> 12:49.920
you understand what he meant.

12:49.930 --> 12:52.720
He's pitching working on
connections as a whole.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.820
Not just invitations.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.350
I understand what Sam was
pitching, because it was my idea,

12:56.360 --> 12:57.370
and I'm in charge of maintenance.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.720
Okay, we'll look into it moving forward!

12:59.730 --> 13:00.860
Good work, Blue Team.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.400
Okay, but what about when
you've done all that,

13:02.420 --> 13:04.130
and you're still not getting
credit for your idea?

13:04.140 --> 13:05.380
Amplification.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.720
- Oh, yes!
- Yep, amplification! Yeah!

13:07.740 --> 13:08.920
Yeah, when we're in meetings together,

13:08.930 --> 13:10.920
we need to speak up, and we'll
give each other credit.

13:10.930 --> 13:12.960
Can Mariana repeat back her great idea?

13:12.970 --> 13:14.880
I just wanna make sure I get
it in the meeting notes.

13:14.890 --> 13:17.170
Right. Good work, Mariana.

13:17.180 --> 13:19.640
Yeah, and these coconut bars are insane.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.300
Nathan.

13:29.310 --> 13:30.960
Whoa! Dennis!

13:30.970 --> 13:33.170
Wow!

13:33.180 --> 13:35.020
- Good to see you, man. Wow!
- You, too.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.080
This is Jesus Adams Foster.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.550
Ah, nice to meet you.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.920
- Thanks for taking the time.
- Yeah! Of course. Have a seat.

13:40.940 --> 13:42.060
Sure.

13:45.770 --> 13:46.770
Been a long time!

13:48.230 --> 13:49.980
Dropped off the face of the Earth!

13:51.850 --> 13:53.270
Understandably.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.470
How you holding up?

13:56.520 --> 13:57.590
I'm good!

13:57.600 --> 13:58.770
- Good.
- Doing well.

13:59.850 --> 14:00.960
Yeah.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.850
So, Jesus has a fantastic concept

14:03.880 --> 14:05.220
that I thought you might
be interested in.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.670
Ah! Yes!

14:06.680 --> 14:08.840
Let's get a couple of
not-so-tiny drinks,

14:08.850 --> 14:10.840
and you can tell me about
these tiny houses.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.060
- Absolutely.
- All right.

14:15.890 --> 14:17.960
Hey, I thought your idea was great.

14:17.970 --> 14:19.580
The first time you said it.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.920
Thanks.

14:20.930 --> 14:23.010
And listen, I'm sorry.

14:23.020 --> 14:26.340
I didn't think about
how trying to kiss you

14:26.350 --> 14:29.340
would make you feel like
I don't respect you.

14:29.380 --> 14:30.620
You're a brilliant engineer,

14:30.650 --> 14:31.660
and I wasn't just saying that

14:31.680 --> 14:34.340
because I wanted to sleep with you.

14:34.350 --> 14:36.880
I swear, I asked for your help
because I really needed it.

14:38.020 --> 14:39.960
- I still do.
- Look.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.960
Alex doesn't want me to
work on the project.

14:41.970 --> 14:44.220
And I'm not gonna work
on it anonymously.

14:44.230 --> 14:47.090
It's hard enough getting credit
for my own ideas around here.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.219
I get that.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.840
If there's anything I can do to help...

14:50.850 --> 14:52.920
I'll let you know.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.760
I'm eyeing the Appellate
Court, then the Supreme Court.

15:00.770 --> 15:02.760
Would be nice to have a good
case on my resume, though.

15:02.770 --> 15:05.760
Not all of us get handed a
huge case in our first week.

15:05.770 --> 15:07.720
Some people are just lucky.

15:07.730 --> 15:09.600
No matter what conflicts come up,

15:09.620 --> 15:10.880
things keep working out for them.

15:10.890 --> 15:13.020
Excuse me. I'm gonna get a drink.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.540
A rosé. Thanks.

15:21.230 --> 15:24.630
How 'bout we drink every time
Ben says "Supreme Court?"

15:24.640 --> 15:26.510
No, thanks. I like my liver.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.679
So, uh, of course,

15:30.680 --> 15:32.850
he told me about the girl
who lives in your building.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.800
Wilson doesn't think it's a conflict.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.540
- Odd.
- Really?

15:36.570 --> 15:39.090
Do you interact with everybody
that lives in your building?

15:39.100 --> 15:41.900
Hi! I'm Kate.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.720
Do you, um... ?

15:43.730 --> 15:46.380
Do you know that guy you
were just talking to?

15:46.390 --> 15:47.670
Why? What did he do?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.170
Nothing!

15:49.180 --> 15:50.539
I just think he's cute.

15:50.540 --> 15:51.760
Wait 'til you meet him.

15:51.770 --> 15:53.090
His name's Ben.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.750
He clerks with us. I'm Callie.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.510
- Hi.
- Rebecca.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.880
Who's your judge?

15:57.890 --> 15:59.560
Judge Wilson. What about you?

15:59.580 --> 16:00.800
Judge Handelman.

16:00.810 --> 16:02.590
Handelman?

16:02.600 --> 16:04.920
Yeah! I mean, I've only been
with him for a few weeks.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.670
Still trying to get the lay of the land.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.560
Rebecca, didn't you use
to clerk for Handelman?

16:09.340 --> 16:11.760
Uh, it was more of an internship

16:11.770 --> 16:13.760
before I got the clerkship
with Judge Wilson.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.530
How was that for you? Working with him?

16:16.390 --> 16:17.390
Fine.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.020
Excuse me.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.020
- Hi. I'm Kate.
- Ben.

16:28.180 --> 16:30.380
Um... I see a colleague.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.200
I should probably go say hi.

16:35.390 --> 16:36.670
She's kinda weird.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.590
She thinks you're cute.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.680
Really?

16:41.270 --> 16:43.760
By the way, it wasn't an internship.

16:43.780 --> 16:45.550
Rebecca was Handelman's clerk,

16:45.560 --> 16:48.090
before she got her grandfather,
the esteemed Senator from Texas,

16:48.100 --> 16:49.920
to pull some strings and get
her transferred to Wilson.

16:49.930 --> 16:50.960
What was wrong with Handelman?

16:50.970 --> 16:53.090
He's just less respected.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.820
Older, not moving up.

16:54.850 --> 16:56.400
It's better to have a judge
with a good reputation

16:56.420 --> 16:57.440
and a future on your resume.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.600
Like Wilson, who's a
Supreme Court contender.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.090
Why do you think she's so sensitive

17:03.100 --> 17:05.020
about having "earned" this clerkship?

17:05.140 --> 17:06.519
Because she didn't.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.839
It was just another opportunity

17:07.859 --> 17:09.349
handed to her on a silver platter.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.420
Hey, Jamie.

17:22.099 --> 17:23.930
Callie! Hi!

17:25.270 --> 17:27.920
Uh, this is, uh...

17:27.930 --> 17:29.340
I'm sorry, I... I didn't get your name.

17:29.350 --> 17:30.960
Rebecca.

17:30.970 --> 17:33.770
We clerk together for Judge Wilson.

17:36.310 --> 17:38.460
I am due for a re-fill.

17:38.470 --> 17:39.930
It's nice meeting you.

17:43.140 --> 17:45.510
Well, what are you doing
at Clerk Cocktails?

17:45.520 --> 17:47.420
Besides hitting on pretty blondes.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.670
Uh, I didn't know it was
clerk cocktail night.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.380
I am actually meeting a client.

17:52.390 --> 17:54.220
Why? Are you jealous?

17:54.230 --> 17:55.260
No.

17:55.270 --> 17:57.220
I'm just playing by
the rules you set up.

17:57.230 --> 17:58.550
How's your artist?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.010
- He's fine.
- Mm-hmm.

18:00.020 --> 18:01.460
I have calls in about his sister's case.

18:01.470 --> 18:02.840
Should have an update soon.

18:02.850 --> 18:04.940
Thank you. I really,
really appreciate it.

18:05.980 --> 18:08.220
Think Judge Wilson will
rule on the motion yet?

18:08.230 --> 18:10.510
To suppress the officer's
personnel records,

18:10.520 --> 18:11.960
in the Jamal case?

18:11.980 --> 18:15.010
No. The hearing's not 'til next week.

18:15.020 --> 18:17.590
So, do you think the new Police
Chief poses a conflict of interest?

18:17.600 --> 18:19.670
I was gonna ask what you think.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.220
I dunno. I think it's a gray area.

18:22.260 --> 18:25.320
Yes, Wilson's son is facing
charges in Berkeley,

18:25.340 --> 18:26.600
and the new Chief has strong ties

18:26.620 --> 18:28.260
to that department and the DA,

18:28.270 --> 18:29.720
but I don't think you can prove

18:29.740 --> 18:31.260
that Wilson is feeling pressure

18:31.270 --> 18:33.130
to go easy on the LAPD as a result.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.060
Unless, the new Chief
didn't want a big ruling

18:35.080 --> 18:37.600
against the LAPD the
first month of his job.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.670
He could use Tate's situation
to lean on Wilson.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.880
You think Wilson can be bought?

18:43.890 --> 18:46.090
I don't agree with his view of the law,

18:46.100 --> 18:47.840
but I respect him.

18:47.850 --> 18:49.260
I think he's ethical.

18:49.270 --> 18:52.090
I mean, I hope he is for the
sake of Jamal's family.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.970
And yours.

18:55.640 --> 18:56.670
Like it or not,

18:56.680 --> 18:58.240
your career is tethered to his now.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.700
Great.

19:05.020 --> 19:06.390
My client's running late.

19:07.890 --> 19:09.550
How late?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.320
Your pants are buzzing.

19:37.430 --> 19:39.300
My client's wondering where I am.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.260
It was, uh, fun bumping into you!

20:08.020 --> 20:09.050
Hey.

20:09.060 --> 20:10.510
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

20:10.520 --> 20:12.010
- We're crashing!
- Mm-hmm.

20:12.020 --> 20:14.220
She may have said something
about meeting a cute law clerk.

20:14.230 --> 20:16.380
Ooh! Who's that?

20:17.180 --> 20:18.460
No! That's Ben.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.760
- Oh.
- Yeah.

20:19.770 --> 20:21.010
Hey, uh, Dennis is gonna meet us.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.300
So if you guys want to grab a table,

20:22.310 --> 20:23.350
I'll get the drinks.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.630
Hey, you never mentioned

20:27.640 --> 20:29.050
how hot Ben was.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.420
You cannot date my coworker.

I'm Jesus.

I'm Becca.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.180
Can I buy you a drink?

No.

I'll buy you one.

21:10.350 --> 21:11.960
Okay, I got one.

21:11.970 --> 21:15.800
What was the worst pick-up

21:15.810 --> 21:17.850
Um...

21:19.430 --> 21:21.310
Hm. Okay.

21:22.230 --> 21:23.590
This one's embarrassing.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.600
Okay, go.

21:25.970 --> 21:27.840
He asked me,

21:27.850 --> 21:30.520
"Did you just fart because
you blew me away?"

21:30.560 --> 21:32.840
- Stop. No.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

21:32.850 --> 21:36.300
- That's really bad.
- I know, it's really bad.

21:36.310 --> 21:37.420
Oh, my goodness.

21:37.430 --> 21:40.380
Okay, um, give me your
best pick-up line.

21:40.580 --> 21:42.960
Oh, I don't have... I don't have one.

21:42.970 --> 21:43.970
Come on.

21:43.971 --> 21:47.510
Okay... um...

21:47.520 --> 21:48.900
What do you do for a living?

21:48.920 --> 21:51.840
- Seriously?
- I told you I have no game.

21:51.850 --> 21:52.850
I don't believe you.

21:52.851 --> 21:53.870

Okay. So...

21:57.600 --> 21:58.800
Excuse me.

21:58.810 --> 22:01.880
My, my buddy is really embarrassed.

22:01.890 --> 22:03.180
He wants to get your phone number

22:03.200 --> 22:04.319
'cause he wants to know the best way

22:04.320 --> 22:05.960
to get ahold of me in the morning.

22:07.310 --> 22:09.420
Ooh.

22:09.430 --> 22:11.180

22:32.470 --> 22:34.130
What, is this the only place you drink?

22:34.140 --> 22:36.080
I could ask you the same.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.220
I'm from out of town so this
is the only bar I know.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.590
I'm sorry I didn't text you.

It's been crazy busy.

22:43.180 --> 22:44.190
No worries.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.360
I'm here with my sisters,

22:46.400 --> 22:48.850
um, are you going to
be around for awhile?

22:48.860 --> 22:50.600
I might.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.100
Okay, well maybe I
could buy you a drink.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.170
Maybe.

22:54.180 --> 22:55.920
Okay.

23:00.850 --> 23:03.570
My coconut bars buttered those
bros up before the meeting

23:03.580 --> 23:05.800
and I used all of my
tips from the Fight Club

23:05.820 --> 23:06.880
and guess what?

23:06.890 --> 23:09.170
Josh actually acknowledged
that I had an idea.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.510
So did he put you on the new project?

23:11.520 --> 23:13.460
Well, no, but...

23:13.470 --> 23:15.260
I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.420
How does you baking brownies

23:17.430 --> 23:19.570
and then thanking someone
for stealing your idea

23:19.580 --> 23:20.590
count as a victory?

23:22.180 --> 23:24.320
You take what you can get
in the real world, Jesus.

23:24.350 --> 23:25.800
Doesn't really sound like you, Mariana.

23:25.810 --> 23:27.700
You've never been one
to settle for scraps.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.130
See, this corporate bullshit
is exactly why I dropped out.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.090
Okay, well not everyone
can quit, Dennis.

23:34.100 --> 23:36.090
And neither of you know what it's like

23:36.100 --> 23:37.110
in a work place

23:37.120 --> 23:38.979
where all of the bros have the power,

23:38.980 --> 23:40.720
and they only use it to help each other.

23:43.730 --> 23:45.670
Well, I have some good news.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.240
Listen, Jesus, I like your idea.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.880
Let me think on it a beat
and I'll get back to you.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.460
- All right?
- Thank you.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.720
- Sounds amazing.
- Great.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.510
Uh, excuse me. I gotta
go to the bathroom.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.680
All right.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.550
- Nice kid.
- Yeah.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.590
I think he's a real hustler.

23:58.600 --> 23:59.630
Yeah.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.630
I've actually been meaning
to reach out to you.

24:02.640 --> 24:05.420
I ran into Jennifer a
couple of months back

24:05.430 --> 24:07.359
and, probably should have asked first,

24:07.360 --> 24:08.680
but we've been seeing each other.

24:10.230 --> 24:12.380
She wanted to tell you, but...

24:12.390 --> 24:14.020
I wanted you to hear it from me.

24:15.890 --> 24:18.100
I appreciate that.

24:18.470 --> 24:20.590
She says the divorce is almost final.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.840
Yeah.

24:22.850 --> 24:25.540
I hope, you know, we're still cool.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.630
Long as Jenn's happy.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.220
Good man.

24:30.230 --> 24:31.520
Come here.

24:33.350 --> 24:34.850
Good. Great seeing you.

24:46.930 --> 24:48.960
Uh, Dennis and I met
with his friend today.

24:48.970 --> 24:50.399
Oh, you guys used to work together.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.409
Yeah.

24:51.410 --> 24:53.050
Anyway, he's a venture capitalist guy

24:53.080 --> 24:55.040
which means he invests in entrepreneurs,

24:55.060 --> 24:56.900
and he really loved my tiny house idea.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.280
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.630
We like, really hit it off.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.630
And then he said, "Oh, I'm
gonna think about it."

25:01.640 --> 25:03.800
And then he called me like an
hour later and said that he's in.

25:03.810 --> 25:05.180
He's gonna back me.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.050
Wow. Um...

25:09.060 --> 25:11.180
Good for you, Jesus.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.500
I'm tired, I think I'm gonna go home.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.670
Uh, what's with her?

25:20.680 --> 25:22.510
She's just really struggling.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.580
Nothing's coming easy for her

25:24.600 --> 25:26.590
and it's Mariana, she's
not used to that.

25:26.660 --> 25:28.760
Should probably go talk to her.

25:28.770 --> 25:31.100
No, you stay. I'll, uh, talk her down.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.040
Hey.

25:34.060 --> 25:35.630
Hi.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.799
So, I was gonna take off but I'll stay

25:38.800 --> 25:40.290
if you want to buy me that drink.

25:40.350 --> 25:43.460
Uh... I do.

25:43.470 --> 25:46.730
But I actually gotta go talk to someone.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.460
Sorry.

26:15.020 --> 26:17.300

was probably wrong.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.520
Look, I'm not mad at you.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.590
Okay, fine, I'm not gonna keep asking.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.960
Okay, look, it's just...

26:22.970 --> 26:25.130
I've been working at
Speckulate for four months,

26:25.140 --> 26:27.840
and getting acknowledged for that
one idea in that one meeting

26:27.850 --> 26:29.560
was the first real win that I've had.

26:29.580 --> 26:31.960
And you kind of just shit all over it.

26:31.980 --> 26:34.060
- Sorry, I didn't mean to.
- And after bro-ing it out

26:34.080 --> 26:35.130
with Dennis for two days,

26:35.140 --> 26:37.630
you've already got a V.C.
throwing money at you.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.800
It just sucks because I
have to work so hard.

26:39.820 --> 26:40.900
Yeah, I work hard too, Mariana.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.760
At being a guy that girls
love and guys love

26:43.770 --> 26:46.340
and everything comes easily to.

26:46.350 --> 26:48.090
Oh, you think...

26:48.100 --> 26:50.420
that it's been easy, having a TBI?

26:50.430 --> 26:51.939
No, but...

26:51.940 --> 26:53.729
I'm not as smart as you,
Callie, or Brandon.

26:53.730 --> 26:56.090
You guys went to college, and now
you're out there killing it.

26:56.100 --> 26:58.380
The best I could do was get
my contractor's license,

26:58.390 --> 27:01.170
and I had to bust my
ass to pass that test.

27:01.180 --> 27:03.100
Nothing in my life has come easy to me.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.420
Look, it makes me sick

27:11.430 --> 27:13.600
how these guys are treating you at work.

27:15.180 --> 27:16.719
I want to kick their asses,

27:16.720 --> 27:18.400
but I know you.

27:18.420 --> 27:20.590
And no one can kick their
asses better than you.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.050
Yeah, he's not wrong about that.

27:23.060 --> 27:27.630
I might not know how the
corporate world works,

27:27.640 --> 27:30.590
but I love you, Mariana.

27:30.600 --> 27:34.420
And all I meant was that
I didn't want to see you

27:34.430 --> 27:36.280
have to play down to their level.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.459
You know, especially since you're, like,

27:39.460 --> 27:41.460
hella smarter than any of these guys.

27:44.180 --> 27:45.390
I love you too.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.630
- Come here.
- Come in here.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.720
Oh, my gosh!

27:50.730 --> 27:51.740
Knocked me out.

27:53.060 --> 27:54.260
It was a love tap.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.460
I think I'm gonna have
another concussion.

27:57.470 --> 27:58.680
No.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.630
What's up?

28:10.640 --> 28:12.130
We're approaching this all wrong.

28:12.140 --> 28:14.300
We don't need to navigate
the culture here,

28:14.310 --> 28:16.420
- we need to change it.
- How?

28:16.440 --> 28:18.590
Well, for starters, closing
the gender pay gap.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.090
Yeah right, how do we do that?

28:20.100 --> 28:22.170
The end of the year performance
reviews are coming up, right?

28:22.180 --> 28:25.020
Let's walk in there and demand
the raises that we deserve.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.670
Well, yeah, okay, but how?

28:26.680 --> 28:28.260
We share our salary info.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.510
Find out what they're paying the
men, and then demand the same.

28:30.520 --> 28:33.720
Wait, sharing our salary information?

28:33.730 --> 28:36.630
We signed non-disclosure
agreements in our contracts.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.760
Look, if they even hear about this,

28:38.770 --> 28:40.260
they can fire us.

28:40.850 --> 28:41.920
Fine.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.670
Then we do it anonymously.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.420
We make sure that they don't find out.

28:51.390 --> 28:53.130
Hey, so...

28:53.140 --> 28:55.180
if you're serious, I know
a way you could help me.

28:56.470 --> 28:58.800
A few of the women and I are
putting together a spreadsheet

28:58.810 --> 29:00.510
to collect data on
what everyone's making

29:00.520 --> 29:02.680
so that we can negotiate
better salaries for ourselves.

29:03.730 --> 29:06.130
Uh, you know about the NDA, right?

29:06.140 --> 29:08.960
Yeah, it's all going to be anonymous.

29:08.970 --> 29:12.090
I could get fired just
knowing about this.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.670
Look, I'm... I'm not gonna tell anyone.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.420
No one's going to know that you
shared your salary information.

29:16.430 --> 29:18.040
We just need to get guys on board,

29:18.060 --> 29:19.380
or else it's not gonna work.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.840
Yo, Mariana.

29:21.850 --> 29:23.920
Are you telling people
that I tried to kiss you?

29:23.930 --> 29:25.090
What?

29:25.100 --> 29:28.090
No. I-I never said that
you tried to kiss me.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.720
Because you didn't.

29:29.730 --> 29:32.240
You heard that, right? I
never tried to kiss her.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.560
Yep.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.230
'Cause you're a witness, now.

29:44.180 --> 29:45.740
Look, I...

29:45.770 --> 29:47.720
I told some of the girls
that someone at work

29:47.730 --> 29:49.880
tried to kiss me and they all
assumed that it was Josh

29:49.890 --> 29:52.880
because, well, apparently he's
tried to kiss a bunch of them.

29:52.890 --> 29:54.920
But I never said that it was you.

29:54.930 --> 29:56.630
Probably didn't need to.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.680
I'm sure they'll figure it out.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.640
Will you think about the spreadsheet?

30:24.270 --> 30:26.850
Raj, are you waiting for me?

30:28.930 --> 30:30.670
I need to talk to you.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.310
Okay. Come on in.

30:56.680 --> 31:00.220
So, um, regarding Elizabeth
Rodgers' sexual harassment suit.

31:00.230 --> 31:03.340
I know it's not my case,
but I planned a precedent

31:03.350 --> 31:05.760
that would allow the judge
to rule in her favor.

31:05.770 --> 31:08.170
Westendorf vs West Coast Contractors

31:08.180 --> 31:09.740
awarded the plaintiff damages

31:09.770 --> 31:12.800
because she wasn't told why she was
fired until after she filed suit.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.180
You're right.

31:17.230 --> 31:19.480
It's not your case, Callie.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.359
Hey, what was that?

31:26.360 --> 31:27.679
She's probably just pissed that

31:27.680 --> 31:29.429
she keeps getting lame
two-day bench trials,

31:29.430 --> 31:30.499
when the whole reason

31:30.500 --> 31:32.429
she got Gramps to transfer her
out of Handelman's office

31:32.430 --> 31:34.800
was so she could get
more high profile cases.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.350
- Ben, Judge would like a word.
- Yeah.

31:44.730 --> 31:48.460
Um, that's not why
Rebecca was transferred.

31:51.520 --> 31:55.500
Judge Handelman's nickname
is "Judge Handsyman."

31:55.520 --> 31:57.060
I'm just saying.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.060
I'm sorry if I overstepped.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.920
Guess I'm just a little sensitive

32:17.930 --> 32:20.090
about this case.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.220
Uh-huh.

32:25.020 --> 32:26.520
I was raped.

32:28.230 --> 32:31.460
And my rapist didn't
face any consequences.

32:32.430 --> 32:34.300
It was when I was in foster care.

32:34.310 --> 32:35.860
I had no power,

32:36.100 --> 32:39.890
and he ended up doing it
again, to another girl.

32:44.140 --> 32:46.720
Becca, did Handelman
sexually harass you?

32:49.270 --> 32:52.100
Wasn't as bad as what happened to you.

32:52.140 --> 32:54.260
All abuse is bad.

33:02.140 --> 33:05.680
It started with a few
inappropriate comments.

33:06.890 --> 33:08.920
I figured, you know,

33:08.930 --> 33:10.300
different generation.

33:10.310 --> 33:13.050
Maybe he didn't mean anything
by the "sweethearts"

33:13.060 --> 33:15.380
and comments about what I was wearing

33:15.390 --> 33:16.640
and my figure.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.640
Then he started touching me.

33:23.430 --> 33:25.380
Hands on the small of my back

33:25.390 --> 33:27.100
as he'd walk by.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.140
Lingering hugs.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.180
Pressing up against me.

33:35.390 --> 33:37.680
I had no one to complain to.

33:42.730 --> 33:44.470
These judges...

33:47.100 --> 33:48.800
they don't have bosses

33:48.810 --> 33:52.670
or... an HR department overseeing them.

33:52.680 --> 33:56.020
The only choice I had
was to tell my family.

33:57.350 --> 33:59.960
So my grandfather pulled some strings,

33:59.970 --> 34:01.479
but I still had to interview with Wilson

34:01.480 --> 34:02.929
to prove I was up to the job.

34:02.930 --> 34:04.890
No one doubts your ability, Rebecca.

34:07.230 --> 34:09.040
Does Wilson know about Handelman?

34:09.080 --> 34:11.050
I'm assuming everyone does.

34:11.060 --> 34:14.060
Look, all I know is that
my grandfather told me

34:14.080 --> 34:15.840
to take the job with Wilson,

34:15.850 --> 34:17.590
keep my mouth shut,

34:17.600 --> 34:20.760
and they'd make sure
Handelman wasn't assigned

34:20.770 --> 34:22.429
any more female clerks.

34:24.060 --> 34:26.080
Wonder if it's happening to Kate.

34:27.179 --> 34:29.010
Maybe if you went public...

34:29.020 --> 34:30.040
I can't.

34:31.139 --> 34:33.510
My family would kill me.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.550
Look, I know it's hard.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.170
I didn't want to come forward either,

34:37.179 --> 34:39.130
but if Kate's being
harassed by Handelman...

34:39.139 --> 34:40.670
I admire that you came forward,

34:40.679 --> 34:43.300
but if I accuse a federal judge,

34:43.310 --> 34:44.630
it'll be all over the news.

34:44.639 --> 34:45.800
And if the press found out

34:45.820 --> 34:47.960
that my grandfather
knew about Handelman,

34:47.969 --> 34:50.199
that could ruin him, politically.

34:51.179 --> 34:53.300
My family would never speak to me again.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.420
So as much as I wish I could, I can't.

34:57.460 --> 35:00.840
If he's doing it to Kate, she's
gonna have to come forward herself.

35:00.850 --> 35:02.380
Well, you know that she won't

35:02.420 --> 35:06.240
'cause she doesn't have a
powerful family to protect her.

35:06.260 --> 35:08.220
If she comes forward, she
won't be transferred,

35:08.240 --> 35:09.640
she'll be ruined.

35:15.140 --> 35:16.890
There's nothing I can do about that.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.020
I'm sorry.

35:33.730 --> 35:36.170
Something has been
brought to my attention

35:36.180 --> 35:39.220
and I need to speak with you, Mariana.

35:39.230 --> 35:41.380
Uh, can we talk in your office?

35:41.390 --> 35:44.300
No, I want everyone to hear this.

35:49.310 --> 35:52.630
I understand that you are being excluded

35:52.640 --> 35:54.880
from working on the new
social network project,

35:54.890 --> 35:56.640
which was assigned to this team,

35:56.660 --> 35:59.740
and when something gets assigned
to a team at Speckulate,

35:59.780 --> 36:02.900
it means the entire team. Got it?

36:04.560 --> 36:07.230
Alex, you got it?

36:08.640 --> 36:10.260
Yeah, sure.

36:10.270 --> 36:11.720
Whatever. I...

36:11.730 --> 36:13.460
- I was just thinking...
- Great.

36:13.470 --> 36:14.670
Great.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.920
I'll let Josh know.

36:23.400 --> 36:24.940
Seriously, Mary-anna?

36:24.960 --> 36:26.640
- You bitched to Angela?
- Hey.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.590
I didn't say a word. I swear.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.240
Then how did she find out?

36:30.930 --> 36:32.060
I told her.

36:34.060 --> 36:35.700
Mariana has great ideas,

36:35.740 --> 36:37.760
and she codes faster than all of us,

36:37.770 --> 36:39.220
even you, Alex.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.810
We need her on this project.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.590
Okay, Raj.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.920
She can work with you.

36:44.930 --> 36:48.300
But maybe that was your
plan all along, huh?

36:48.310 --> 36:49.520
I need a kombucha.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.960
Et tu, Brute ?

37:00.280 --> 37:02.140
That was a savage move, dude.

37:03.270 --> 37:05.220
I should have done it sooner.

37:05.230 --> 37:08.080
And send me that spreadsheet.

37:13.310 --> 37:17.170
So I wrote it in favor
of Elizabeth Rodgers,

37:17.180 --> 37:19.670
using your precedent.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.180
But...

37:22.120 --> 37:24.099
I'd appreciate it if
you didn't tell anyone

37:24.100 --> 37:25.429
about our conversation earlier.

37:33.470 --> 37:36.020
Sorry you have to work for an asshole.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.520
Sorry, I didn't know anyone was here.

37:54.930 --> 37:56.560
Can I ask you a personal question?

37:57.600 --> 37:58.740
Sure.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.380
You had a tough childhood.

38:01.390 --> 38:02.770
Foster care, juvie.

38:03.850 --> 38:05.630
How did you end up going to law school

38:05.640 --> 38:07.810
without screwing your life up?

38:14.350 --> 38:16.940
Well, I was adopted

38:17.020 --> 38:18.310
by my moms.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.380
And they made me feel wanted

38:22.390 --> 38:25.640
and like I could do
something with my life.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.300
Yeah, but...

38:29.310 --> 38:31.680
it's not just about good parenting.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.810
What...

38:36.310 --> 38:40.270
What's inside you that drives
you to want to succeed?

38:43.060 --> 38:44.180
I don't know.

38:50.100 --> 38:51.310
My son...

38:53.390 --> 38:55.020
has no respect for me...

38:55.600 --> 38:57.220
or his mother,

38:57.230 --> 38:58.700
or himself.

38:58.740 --> 39:00.460
He had too much privilege.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.740
No one ever truly appreciates that

39:02.770 --> 39:04.350
which is not earned.

39:11.060 --> 39:13.360
Many ways...

39:13.970 --> 39:15.220
I blame myself.

39:16.430 --> 39:18.800
But sometimes I think

39:18.810 --> 39:24.100
character is just something
you're born with.

39:24.940 --> 39:26.310
Or not.

39:29.020 --> 39:30.900
You have character, Callie.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.170
Try not to...

39:33.180 --> 39:36.560
compromise that as you
go forth in your career.

39:38.020 --> 39:40.000
Situations...

39:40.890 --> 39:44.060
can get more complicated.

39:45.270 --> 39:49.340
Grey areas are not as easy to navigate.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.630
I'll be expecting your memo

39:57.640 --> 39:59.690
on the defense motion
for the Thompson case

39:59.700 --> 40:01.310
on my desk by Monday.

40:05.430 --> 40:07.240
It was really nice having you here.

40:07.250 --> 40:08.349
Oh, you sure?

40:08.350 --> 40:09.579
Oh!

40:09.580 --> 40:11.199
Uh, it's good, 'cause I'll
be back in a few weeks

40:11.200 --> 40:12.349
for a meeting with Nathan.

40:12.350 --> 40:14.460
Also, Brandon's couch sucks!

40:14.470 --> 40:16.340
- It does.
- I am so sorry.

40:16.350 --> 40:17.670
I had to work all day.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.300
Can we grab dinner before you go?

40:19.310 --> 40:21.420
Um, I actually made plans with that girl

40:21.430 --> 40:22.730
- that I met the other night.
- Ooh.

40:22.740 --> 40:24.460
I asked her to meet
me here. Is that okay?

40:24.470 --> 40:25.479
Yeah.

40:25.480 --> 40:26.630
Hey, Becca.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.130
Uh, these are my sisters.

40:28.140 --> 40:30.310
Mariana and Callie.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.780
Your Honor.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.010
Can I ask you a favor?

40:47.020 --> 40:49.470
It's about Judge Handelman.
