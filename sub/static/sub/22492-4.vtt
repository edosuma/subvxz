00:18.931 --> 00:20.831
It's alive!

00:40.219 --> 00:44.323
Ah, what a wonderful day
to make cookies.

00:50.696 --> 00:51.890
Oh, my god!

00:51.964 --> 00:54.933
Hide the recipes!

00:55.000 --> 00:56.024
Oh, my god!

00:56.101 --> 00:57.568
Ow! My foot!
My foot!

00:59.004 --> 01:01.495
You bastard!

01:03.876 --> 01:05.711
Mom!
Where's my costume?

01:05.746 --> 01:06.877
Here it is, Randy.

01:06.912 --> 01:09.415
A Power Rangers costume,
just like you asked.

01:09.450 --> 01:10.404
It's a girl's costume!

01:11.617 --> 01:12.811
My friends are here!

01:12.885 --> 01:15.080
Nobody cares what color
your costume is.

01:15.154 --> 01:17.054
Look!

01:17.122 --> 01:18.885
Randy's going as
Elton John this year.

01:18.958 --> 01:20.118
Fuck you guys.

01:20.192 --> 01:22.285
Mom, I need a
trick-or-treat bag!

01:22.361 --> 01:23.953
We're out of shopping bags,
honey.

01:24.029 --> 01:25.053
Just use this.

01:26.432 --> 01:28.764
Nice purse, lady!

01:28.834 --> 01:30.096
Here you are, little girl.

01:31.203 --> 01:32.101
That does it!

01:32.171 --> 01:33.468
I'm going home!

01:34.440 --> 01:35.464
It's too small.

01:35.541 --> 01:36.508
I- I can't get it off!

01:36.575 --> 01:38.941
This is the greatest
Halloween ever!

01:39.011 --> 01:41.445
It's Armpit!
Run!

01:42.548 --> 01:45.039
Come here!

01:45.117 --> 01:46.982
Ow!

01:47.052 --> 01:48.178
Hey, baby.

01:48.254 --> 01:50.415
You, me... going for a ride.

01:50.489 --> 01:51.581
No.

01:53.158 --> 01:54.216
Oh, no.

01:54.293 --> 01:56.284
Armpit's gonna rape Randy.

02:06.905 --> 02:10.169
Nobody... Understands me!

02:10.241 --> 02:14.372
I try to fit in... But I'm filled
with so much rage!

02:14.446 --> 02:17.244
Why did my soccer coach
do that to me?

02:30.029 --> 02:31.428
You know what, sweetheart?

02:31.497 --> 02:32.862
I didn't even get your name.

02:34.099 --> 02:35.862
Are you Randy McCormick?

02:35.934 --> 02:36.901
Yes!

02:36.969 --> 02:38.197
Oh, thank goodness you're here!

02:38.270 --> 02:39.294
I'm Randy McCormick!

02:39.371 --> 02:40.804
Randy McCormick?!

02:40.873 --> 02:42.841
I'm gonna kill you, man!

02:45.311 --> 02:46.369
Randy,
I'm afraid your mom's dead.

02:46.445 --> 02:47.275
What?!

02:47.346 --> 02:48.278
It was a fire, son.

02:48.347 --> 02:49.609
It seems all she had time to do

02:49.682 --> 02:51.673
was write this note saying
she never loved you.

02:51.750 --> 02:52.774
Oh, no!

02:52.851 --> 02:55.547
Right before she
shot your dog.

02:55.621 --> 02:58.590
Have a happy Halloween.

03:07.166 --> 03:10.703
Court's adjourned.

03:16.775 --> 03:18.042
I think we're frakked.

03:18.077 --> 03:19.243
I can't see any frakking way

03:19.278 --> 03:20.646
we can survive
this frakkin' assault.

03:20.681 --> 03:21.845
Sorry, sir.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.013
I need to be excused.

03:23.048 --> 03:24.777
I got to take a shart...
a massive,

03:24.817 --> 03:26.910
wet, sloppy, huge,
frakkin' shart.

03:26.952 --> 03:28.249
Sorry I'm late, guys.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.584
I was just havin' arnal sex in
the locker room.

03:31.990 --> 03:35.824
Who the frak jarked off in my
frakkin' coffee?!

03:35.894 --> 03:37.418
What the fuck are
they saying?

03:38.197 --> 03:42.000
Oh, it is ever so lonely
being the last unicorn.

03:42.035 --> 03:44.203
Will I ever find a friend?

03:44.238 --> 03:45.471
Yo!

03:46.872 --> 03:51.275
Oh, to be the last unicorn is
a woeful plight, indeed.

03:51.410 --> 03:52.476
Bret Matthews,

03:52.511 --> 03:54.712
a normal teenager until he
crashed his car

03:54.747 --> 03:57.449
into a secret government
molecular-transfer ray.

03:57.484 --> 03:59.144
Now, whenever bret
gets too hot,

03:59.218 --> 04:02.915
he becomes the incredible
turbo teen.

04:19.471 --> 04:21.964
Oh, yeah!

04:22.040 --> 04:23.905
Do me, Alex!
Do me!

04:23.976 --> 04:24.874
Alex, do me!

04:24.943 --> 04:25.773
Come on!

04:26.745 --> 04:27.939
Alex, I'm worried.

04:28.013 --> 04:29.708
You afraid Bret's gonna
find out his girl's

04:29.782 --> 04:31.113
cheating on him
with his best friend?

04:31.183 --> 04:32.377
No, stupid.

04:32.451 --> 04:33.918
I'm worried our sex stains
won't come out

04:33.986 --> 04:34.816
of those leather seats.

04:35.788 --> 04:37.050
I love being a slut!

04:37.122 --> 04:39.249
Dude, free car!

04:45.764 --> 04:47.755
Sorry, dude.

05:01.246 --> 05:02.178
Let's get out of here!

05:02.247 --> 05:05.011
Yeah!

05:23.569 --> 05:26.732
Aaa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!

05:36.482 --> 05:37.815
Easter bunny!
Easter bunny!

05:37.850 --> 05:40.185
I found nine easter eggs
and a chocolate one!

05:40.220 --> 05:42.312
I didn't hide any
chocolate eggs.

05:43.722 --> 05:44.922
Give it up, Tracy!

05:44.957 --> 05:47.191
You'll never take us alive!

05:47.226 --> 05:50.010
Wasn't planning on it,
Pruneface.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.795
It's final cut for you,
Flattop.

05:52.865 --> 05:55.129
Fuck you, Mumbles.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.224
Wow, Dick!

05:56.301 --> 05:57.563
You really showed them.

05:57.636 --> 05:59.365
Ha! I sure did, Horsemouth.

05:59.438 --> 06:01.429
Uh, do you need a ride back
to the station?

06:01.507 --> 06:02.565
No, thanks, Big Ears.

06:02.641 --> 06:03.972
I think I'll walk.

06:04.042 --> 06:05.703
You've got to take it easy
with the nicknames, Tracy.

06:05.777 --> 06:07.005
Criminals are fine,

06:07.079 --> 06:09.138
but guys in the precinct are
taking it personal.

06:09.214 --> 06:12.479
You do things your way,
Man-boobs, I'll do them mine.

06:12.551 --> 06:14.280
Hey! How's it going,
Deepthroat?

06:14.353 --> 06:15.183
How does he know?

06:15.254 --> 06:16.152
Uh...

06:16.221 --> 06:17.381
I was talking to you, buddy.

06:17.456 --> 06:18.388
Paper, mister?

06:18.457 --> 06:19.924
No, thanks, Pre-pubes.

06:19.992 --> 06:21.789
So that's the reason they
call you Dick.

06:21.860 --> 06:22.849
Yeah.

06:24.096 --> 06:25.654
That's the reason.

06:25.964 --> 06:28.665
Randy Mccormick!

06:28.700 --> 06:30.395
I'm gonna kill you, man!

06:30.469 --> 06:32.460
Aa-a-a-a-a-h!

06:36.308 --> 06:39.811
Wisp, you must follow the
sphere of light to a land

06:39.846 --> 06:42.948
without color and rescue
the seven color kids.

06:42.983 --> 06:44.006
Once there,

06:44.082 --> 06:46.710
you will be forever known
as Rainbow Brite.

06:46.785 --> 06:48.082
Will you accept this mission?

06:48.153 --> 06:49.085
Yes, I will!

06:49.154 --> 06:51.782
Then follow
the sphere of light.

06:52.758 --> 06:53.690
Call it.

06:53.759 --> 06:55.283
Time of death... 4:15 p.m.

06:56.395 --> 06:57.453
Oh, no, our child!

06:57.529 --> 06:58.359
My baby!

06:58.430 --> 07:00.295
We'll never make another.

07:04.736 --> 07:06.537
So, you're trying to tell me

07:06.572 --> 07:08.904
Venom did this to mask
headquarters?

07:08.974 --> 07:10.100
Um...

07:10.175 --> 07:11.005
Yes?

07:11.076 --> 07:12.043
Malarkey, Scott.

07:12.110 --> 07:13.441
What really happened
last night?

07:13.512 --> 07:14.536
Uh...

07:16.748 --> 07:17.612
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

07:17.683 --> 07:18.650
Look at me!

07:18.717 --> 07:20.082
I'm in mask!

07:20.152 --> 07:22.780
Aa-a-a-a-a-h!

07:22.854 --> 07:24.219
Whoa-oh!

07:24.289 --> 07:26.780
This is the greatest day
of my life!

07:26.858 --> 07:29.190
Whoo-hoo!

07:32.531 --> 07:34.226
You're grounded, mister.

07:34.299 --> 07:36.199
Such an asshole!

07:38.570 --> 07:40.128
He's never had a mother,
Sato.

07:40.205 --> 07:44.266
Sato say good woman will do
70 chores around the house...

07:44.343 --> 07:46.368
cooking and 69.

07:46.445 --> 07:49.505
Oh, Sato, you're
fantastically offensive.

07:49.581 --> 07:51.071
A dating website?

07:51.149 --> 07:53.049
That could be a huge security
risk, Matt.

07:53.118 --> 07:54.085
Sorry, Hondo.

07:54.152 --> 07:55.619
I just don't meet
that many women.

07:55.687 --> 07:57.348
Why don't you just
date Gloria?

07:59.224 --> 08:00.156
Nnah.

08:00.225 --> 08:01.658
I'm more of a chubby chaser.

08:01.727 --> 08:04.753
Yeah, there's nothing like a
big, hard... wait.

08:04.830 --> 08:06.821
What did you mean by chubby?

08:19.945 --> 08:21.037
Oh, Matt.

08:22.214 --> 08:23.238
Wow!

08:23.315 --> 08:24.976
Bitchin' car!

08:25.050 --> 08:26.517
You ain't seen nothing yet.

08:28.954 --> 08:30.353
Madre de dios!

08:32.791 --> 08:33.849
Dang!

08:33.924 --> 08:36.018
Does everything in
this house transform?

08:36.094 --> 08:36.924
Yeah.

08:36.995 --> 08:38.962
Watch this, baby.

08:42.501 --> 08:44.128
Wow!

08:44.202 --> 08:46.970
Mmm!

08:47.039 --> 08:48.870
So all y'all have masks, huh?

08:48.940 --> 08:50.601
<i>Don't I get a mask?</i>

08:50.676 --> 08:52.644
Yeah, you sure do.

09:00.952 --> 09:02.817
Darlene's pregnant, Sato!

09:02.888 --> 09:04.287
What am I gonna do?

09:04.356 --> 09:08.918
Sato say shotgun wedding is
case of wife or death.

09:13.065 --> 09:13.997
I do.

09:14.066 --> 09:15.226
Then by the power vested in me,

09:15.300 --> 09:17.495
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

09:19.304 --> 09:21.295
You may kiss the bride.

09:23.308 --> 09:25.333
Now!

09:25.410 --> 09:26.843
Oh, my god.

09:26.912 --> 09:28.402
Miles Mayhem?!

09:28.480 --> 09:29.572
He's the leader of Venom.

09:29.648 --> 09:30.512
Ha ha ha!

09:30.582 --> 09:32.311
The joke's on you, Trakker!

09:34.519 --> 09:36.783
Now I have all your secrets,
mask!

09:36.855 --> 09:39.187
Venom legally owns
half your shit.

09:39.257 --> 09:41.122
Just try and divorce me!

09:41.193 --> 09:42.524
But I put my...

09:42.594 --> 09:43.583
you put your...

09:43.662 --> 09:45.061
Oh, my god.

09:45.130 --> 09:48.759
Sato say gay dinosaur called
mega-sore-ass.

09:48.834 --> 09:52.270
You'll have to bathe yourself
from now on, Scott Trakker!

09:54.272 --> 09:55.261
Mom?

09:56.408 --> 09:57.466
What a plan!

09:57.542 --> 09:58.839
Nothing can stop us now!

09:58.910 --> 10:00.207
Yeah.

10:00.278 --> 10:01.745
But wouldn't it
have been easier

10:01.813 --> 10:02.802
to send me instead?

10:02.881 --> 10:04.508
I mean,
I'm an actual chick.

10:04.583 --> 10:06.574
Silence!

10:14.326 --> 10:16.726

Aah!

10:48.126 --> 10:49.559
Oh! Aah! Ohh!

Oh, there is no God!

10:51.596 --> 10:52.790
Come on, Joss.

10:52.864 --> 10:55.332
That's why you got kicked off
"Wonder Woman. "
