00:06.048 --> 00:08.217
Nom, nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.178
-Jacqueline!
-[Jacqueline] In a minute.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.055
I picked up that gift at Christie's.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.849
The auction house,
not Christie's Discount Belts.

00:15.933 --> 00:19.478
A mistake that I turned
into a "shopportunity."

00:20.145 --> 00:21.313
It's a star!

00:23.357 --> 00:25.734
[gasps] Ah-ooga!

00:25.817 --> 00:28.278
Amana-amana-amana! Boi-oi-oi-oi-oing!

00:28.362 --> 00:29.821
Thank you, Kimmy.

00:29.905 --> 00:32.031
It's Orson Snyder's 75th birthday.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.534
Look at what I found him.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.035
You got him a Ping-Pong paddle?

00:35.118 --> 00:37.829
<i>The</i> Ping-Pong paddle that Forrest Gump
used to defeat the Chinese.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.708
While you were in the bunker,
we found out that Forrest Gump is real.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.335
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.420
So is Russ coming back for the party?

00:45.504 --> 00:48.757
I should've bought you one of those
sexy clear belts I saw at Christie's.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.592
You can see everything.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.054
Actually, Russ got back this afternoon.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.431
He's just so jet-lagged,
I'm letting him sleep.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.684
[Russ snoring]

00:58.767 --> 01:00.602
Tonight is a big night.

01:00.686 --> 01:03.272
Step one in our plan to get the Redskins
to change their name.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.815
-[gasps] Ooh, let me guess the plan.
-Please don't.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.900
At the party, you suggest everyone
play Truth or Dare.

01:06.984 --> 01:07.901
You know that's wrong.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.653
If they choose dare,
dare them to change the name.

01:09.736 --> 01:10.571
They have to do it.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.698
If they go truth,
tell them you're Native American.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.032
-No!
-They say, "That's not

01:14.116 --> 01:14.950
how the game works!"

01:15.033 --> 01:16.827
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.038
The Snyders cannot know I'm Sioux.
No one can.

01:20.122 --> 01:23.208
They have to accept me as one of them,
which means they have to think I'm white.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.460
Oh, that's no fun. We're the worst.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.629
[Russ yawns, sniffs]

01:27.713 --> 01:30.465
Jacqueline, I had the most amazing dream.

01:30.549 --> 01:31.591
I bowled a 90.

01:32.718 --> 01:33.802
Good morning, Buckley.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.053
[Buckley] Oh, hey, Russ.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.972
I thought you were
a pile of dirty clothes.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.099
Well observed, Buckley.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.352
In Namibia, women kept trying to put me
on their heads and take me to the river.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.395
[Russ chuckles]

01:43.478 --> 01:45.897
And you must be Kimmy.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.734
Well, Jacqueline, you were wrong.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.194
She's exactly as attractive
as Pippi Longstocking.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.988
Thank you!

01:53.071 --> 01:56.116
Jacqueline has been filling me in
on Operation Plan.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.367
Don't worry.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.953
I'll keep treating her like she's white.

02:00.037 --> 02:03.373
Jacqueline, how was that lobster roll?

02:03.457 --> 02:06.418
The key to the whole thing
is me winning over Russ's dad.

02:06.501 --> 02:09.378
Yes, Orson Hamrod Snyder.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.715
He rules over the team with an iron fist

02:11.798 --> 02:14.635
that he keeps in a box
called The Fist Box,

02:14.718 --> 02:16.678
and he does not like me.

02:16.762 --> 02:17.846
But he loves me.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.973
[Russ] So, to truly get Dad to--

02:20.057 --> 02:23.101
[sighs]
Sorry, he hates it when I call him that.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.854
To truly get Orson to trust Jacqueline,

02:25.937 --> 02:29.232
she's gonna have to pretend
to dislike me as much as he does.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.693
Then we start phase two.

02:31.777 --> 02:35.113
So tonight we have to get
into a huge fight.

02:35.197 --> 02:38.492
Oh, how could I get mad at that face?

02:38.575 --> 02:42.996
Well, if it helps, I refuse
to harm the tick that's in my beard.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.623
I could use that.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.833
Boy, this sounds complicated.

02:46.917 --> 02:50.879
Oh, Operation Plan has crashed
my PowerPoint more than once.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.965
One could almost say
there's too much ClipArt.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.717
[Jacqueline]
But Russ has thought it all out.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.887
He's the brains.
I'm just the beauty... and the muscle.

02:58.970 --> 02:59.971
-Yeah.
-[Kimmy gasps]

03:00.055 --> 03:02.974
Can I be the guy that's
one day away from retirement?

03:03.058 --> 03:05.560
"Oh, I'm getting too old for this, sugar."

03:07.562 --> 03:11.733
[man] <i>You're watching Sadsack TV,</i>
<i>random stuff from the '70s...</i>

03:11.817 --> 03:13.777

03:13.860 --> 03:17.072
-Titus?
-Do not interrupt my spa time.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.324
It's only been one week
since I let Mikey go, Kimmy.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.035
And being kind, wise, and mature

03:22.119 --> 03:23.370
was very hard on me.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.039
Now I know why Yoda looked
like a piece of dried green poop.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.625
Well, you promised
to give me acting lessons

03:28.708 --> 03:30.460
to beef up my college application.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.129
I don't have any extracurriculars.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.966
I don't recall making that promise.
But I've been forgetting so much lately.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.511
Did I take my medicine? What is this?

03:39.594 --> 03:41.680
Where am I? I want to go home!

03:41.763 --> 03:43.390
Titus, you are home.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.641
You're not my daughter.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.184
Don't you know me? It's your Kimmy.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.477

03:48.645 --> 03:51.064

back already to marry me?

Don't answer that door
until I lose 15 pounds.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.804
That's me.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.265
But around these parts,
they call me Karate Kim.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.850
I'm Wendy Hebert.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.060
I'm here with your updated
divorce settlement

04:29.144 --> 04:33.815
from Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne,
aka Dick Wayne, aka DJ Slizzard.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.525

04:35.609 --> 04:37.694
Oh! Let me go get our pen.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.780
Wow, you have a lovely home.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.115
-We really don't, but thanks.
-Ugh. Where you from?

04:42.199 --> 04:44.743
So I understand that
you're gonna take your portion

04:44.826 --> 04:47.829
of the divided assets and pay for college?

04:48.330 --> 04:51.208
Kudos to you. That's wonderful.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.376
I, myself, have two graduate degrees.

Wow! They must love you
at the frame store.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.632

Man, I can't even imagine

05:00.592 --> 05:03.887

would marry the Reverend on purpose.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.514

05:05.597 --> 05:08.809
to whatever dusty, crocheted
toilet paper doll agreed to that,

05:08.892 --> 05:10.602

05:12.521 --> 05:14.898
Mystery bitch. [laughs] Ouch!

05:14.981 --> 05:17.818
I mean, I would never speak
about another woman that way.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.321
Especially since I'm mystery bitch.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.280
Woof?

05:22.948 --> 05:24.366
Meaning I'm marrying Richard.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.117
You're marrying the Reverend?

05:27.077 --> 05:29.246
Why did you bring
those divorce papers in person?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.163
That's weird.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.499
Is it weird? [sighs]

05:32.582 --> 05:34.292
I know. I'm sorry.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.587

were so anxious to get started

05:37.671 --> 05:39.422
with this new chapter in our lives

05:39.506 --> 05:41.675
and it was brought to my attention
that if I get these signed

05:41.758 --> 05:43.969
and get 'em back to Durnsville
by Thursday,

05:44.052 --> 05:46.388
we could actually get married
on Fried Chicken Night.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.432
Which, you know, he hates fried chicken,
but he loves the sides.

will judge our relationship.

There's only one reason
they're saying that to me,

and it's 'cause I'm engaged
to an incarcerated man

to the nearest Kinko's, okay?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.012
[sobbing]

19:42.431 --> 19:44.392
[sighs] I don't know what to do.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.102
It's like I'm 16 again living in a town

19:46.185 --> 19:47.728
where the most exciting thing
that ever happened

19:47.812 --> 19:49.355
was when the <i>The Guinness Book</i>
<i>of World Records </i> came

19:49.438 --> 19:51.190
and measured our tumbleweed.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.900
So close.

19:54.235 --> 19:57.113
The only thing I could do then
was run away,

19:57.196 --> 19:59.281
which was the right move.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.617
And now...

20:01.701 --> 20:04.328
it's time for me to run away again.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.246
Disappear forever.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.206
Step one-- win <i>America's Next Top Model.</i>

20:08.666 --> 20:13.462
And maybe that was your plan
the whole time--

20:13.546 --> 20:16.799
to make me leave and start a new life.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.344
So, if I'm right,

20:20.428 --> 20:23.472
just continue to lie there
and not make any sounds at all.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.730
-Okay.
-[Russ moaning]

20:31.731 --> 20:32.815
Okay, fine.

20:34.650 --> 20:38.487
I guess I'll just stay right here
and read about...

20:38.571 --> 20:42.450
Diane Lane's favorite dog breeds
for pleasing your man.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.244
What does that even mean?

20:45.327 --> 20:46.662
[printer clicks]

20:47.955 --> 20:49.290
Why isn't Kimmy back?

20:49.373 --> 20:51.041
She better not just be gone.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.752
Dick told me she was always
trying to run away.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.879
No, she's coming back.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.883
It's not just about
Fried Chicken Night, man.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.260
I got to lock this relationship down.

21:01.343 --> 21:05.306
I'm pretty sure that Richard
is still writing two of his sex pen pals.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.476
And one of 'em has chest implants.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.186
I can't compete with that.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.520
Wendy, I--

21:13.564 --> 21:16.776
You know you're pretty-looking
and such, right?

21:16.859 --> 21:18.402
[scoffs]

21:18.486 --> 21:21.238
Titus, I've been hurt very badly

21:21.322 --> 21:22.615
in my previous relationships

21:22.698 --> 21:25.284
by guys who looked real good on paper.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.621
Guess what.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.706
Turns out you're not a good guy

21:30.790 --> 21:34.001
just 'cause you came up
with a hot ad campaign for walnuts.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.921
But with Richard, I know what I'm getting.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.965
He won't cheat on me with my neighbor
'cause he can't.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.968
He can't scream at me
when the Steelers lose.

21:43.052 --> 21:46.722
He can't flip my cereal bowl in my face
and call me a dummy.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.307
A man flipped cereal at you?

21:48.390 --> 21:51.936
'Cause now I eat my cereal at home
before I go to the prison.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.522
I'm in control for once.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.398
I'm not stupid, Titus.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.860
I know it's not a fairy-tale romance.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.029
We only get to see each other
an hour a week.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.573
But that's why this is gonna work.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.493
If we only see each other one hour a week,

22:07.576 --> 22:10.037
he'll never realize
what a useless piece of crap I am,

22:10.120 --> 22:12.122
and he'll love me forever.

22:12.206 --> 22:14.625
And that's what I deserve.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.752
[straining] Wendy...

22:16.836 --> 22:18.087
I'm gonna fix you.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.922
I'm gonna fix you!

22:20.005 --> 22:21.882
[Duke laughing]

22:21.966 --> 22:23.592
Sorry it took us so long to get here.

22:23.676 --> 22:27.555
I found a ton of rare nom-noms
on the way over and crushed it.

22:27.638 --> 22:30.349
Well, the doctor said
that Russ may never come--

22:30.432 --> 22:31.517
Ooh, garlic bread!

22:31.600 --> 22:34.812
[munching]

22:36.438 --> 22:37.940
-[shimmering tone]
-[laughs]

22:38.023 --> 22:40.317
You made that bread your bitch, son.

22:40.401 --> 22:41.360
[chuckles]

22:41.443 --> 22:44.989
So, Jacqueline... how's Russ?

22:45.072 --> 22:47.658
Well, we know he can still poop.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.452
I just wish we'd figured that out
before they put the cast on him.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.997
Look, obviously, this is awkward.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.916
Now that you know my heritage,
I'm sure you want nothing to do with me.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.752
Don't be ridiculous, Jacqueline.

22:58.836 --> 23:02.256
No, in fact, we want you to know,

23:02.339 --> 23:05.676
if you pushed Russ in front of that car...

23:05.759 --> 23:06.594
we get it.

23:06.677 --> 23:07.761
What?

23:07.845 --> 23:10.889
-But you own the Redskins.
-Exactly.

23:10.973 --> 23:13.892
-And your heritage...
-Is an important part of who I am.

23:13.976 --> 23:16.061
Yes, perfect. Say crap like that.

23:16.145 --> 23:19.773
Until my little promotion today,
I was head of PR for the Redskins.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.400
I won a Digie for my sweet tweets.

23:21.483 --> 23:25.446
But just imagine the optics of having
a Native American in the family.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.572
We'll be bulletproof.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.574
What do you mean "in the family"?

23:28.657 --> 23:32.995
Let's get you and Russ married
before God takes him.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.289
You'll never get me!

23:35.789 --> 23:38.626
I'm better than you! Father.

23:38.709 --> 23:41.003
You brought a priest?

23:41.879 --> 23:43.547
[sighs]

23:43.631 --> 23:45.341
[printer clicks]

23:49.011 --> 23:51.180
She's one of God's little babies, Kimmy.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.599
-What?
-Wendy needs your help.

23:53.682 --> 23:57.269
No. Titus, I just spent all night
doing stuff for myself...

23:57.353 --> 23:58.228
for college.

23:58.312 --> 24:01.649
Kimberly, Wendy's like
a beautiful, rare Barbie

24:01.732 --> 24:03.776
that some boys pulled the arms
and legs off of

24:03.859 --> 24:06.278
and now the family dog
is chewing on the connector nubs.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.864
I'm worried she won't go back
together again.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.324
She's tragic.

24:10.407 --> 24:14.203
Right now she's looking
for a deli to get waffles to go.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.330
Waffles don't travel!

24:16.413 --> 24:18.707
I did everything I could
to make her see she's better than this.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.000
I even tried to seduce her.

24:20.084 --> 24:23.045
[light instrumental music]

24:29.176 --> 24:31.345
She's immune to my charm.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.639
-I think only you can--
-Stop it!

24:33.722 --> 24:35.307
Like you said, I don't know her.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.226
I for sure don't understand her.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.688
Why should I be responsible for
that dusty, crocheted toilet paper doll?

24:40.771 --> 24:42.564
That description of Wendy
is now considered offensive.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.191
As a society, we've moved on.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.619
[Jacqueline]
Look, I'm not sure about this.

24:55.703 --> 24:56.912
Russ is unconscious.

24:56.995 --> 24:57.996
Yeah, that's why it's perfect.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.665
You get his money, the Snyders get you,

24:59.748 --> 25:02.292
and no one has to go
to a bachelor party at an arboretum.

25:02.376 --> 25:05.295
[laughter]

25:05.379 --> 25:07.798
All right, Russ, obviously,
you want to marry her.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.427
She's tall, hot, and,
for the first time, not inflatable.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.429
-[laughter]
-Sick burn, Father.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.805
[priest] Oh, right?

25:14.888 --> 25:17.015
-Now, blonde lady...
-Thank you.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.685
Do you take Russ to have and to hold,

25:19.768 --> 25:21.687
in just sickness, I guess?

25:21.770 --> 25:23.105
[laughter]

25:23.188 --> 25:26.275
Russ, I don't know what you want me to do.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.943
Is this still the plan?

25:30.654 --> 25:31.864
Iktomi.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.658
[bright woodwind music]

25:34.742 --> 25:36.410
So you gonna marry him or not?

25:42.166 --> 25:43.041
I do.

25:43.125 --> 25:45.544
Welcome to the Redskins family!

25:45.627 --> 25:47.296
[laughs] Oh!

25:54.470 --> 25:56.764
-[door opens]
-Titus, come on.

25:56.847 --> 25:59.308
I didn't know
if waffles would travel well,

25:59.391 --> 26:01.477
so I also got fish tacos.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.773
[Titus] Help her, Kimmy. Don't sign.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.400
I know you need the money,
but you'll find another way,

26:08.484 --> 26:11.195
like two Christian teens
who signed an abstinence pledge,

26:11.278 --> 26:12.488
'cause you're a survivor.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.698
You survived the bunker.

26:14.782 --> 26:17.785
You need a bunker flashback.
Those always work.

26:17.868 --> 26:21.079
Plus, it gives me a chance
to just hang out and eat some cheese.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.748
Um... bunker flashback.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.374
[stammering]

26:24.458 --> 26:26.210
-Flashback to your tragic past.
-Titus.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.670
Uh... trigger word... um...

26:28.754 --> 26:29.630
Galoshes.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.715
Brigadoon. Candelabra. Cumberbatch.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.926
Kokomo. Flippy-floppy. Donga.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.428
-[echoing] Razmatazz.
-[speaking Spanish]

26:36.512 --> 26:38.889
[in Spanish] How long have you been here?

26:38.972 --> 26:40.599
It ends now!

26:40.682 --> 26:43.769
[Cyndee in English] Wow, I guess
it's winter outside, Sister Kimmy.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.270
We were way off.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.522
[in Spanish] I'm going to kill him!

26:46.605 --> 26:48.232
[in English] It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.775
We're not letting the Reverend near you.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.735
[in Spanish] I just need to get near him!

26:51.819 --> 26:54.530
I'm hiding an icicle in my butt!

26:54.613 --> 26:56.073
When he comes at me,

26:56.156 --> 27:01.119
I'll stab him in the eye
and drive it into his brain!

27:01.203 --> 27:03.580
I'm Kimmy. This is Cyndee.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.541
The Reverend wants to marry you, okay?

27:05.624 --> 27:06.667
He thinks it'll make us jealous.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.670
Yeah, and I'd only be jealous
if he married the cab driver from <i>Wings.</i>

27:09.753 --> 27:10.921
[in Spanish] Quick!

27:11.004 --> 27:14.424
Before the icicle melts,
just tell me where to go!

27:14.508 --> 27:15.843
Shh, it's okay.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.135
[in Spanish] Let go of me!

27:17.219 --> 27:18.846
I don't know you. I don't understand you.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.265
But I'm not letting that monster
hurt another person.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.891
[in Spanish] Why are you so strong?!

27:23.767 --> 27:25.477
So you're not marrying
the Reverend tonight.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.604
-Huh?
-I'll marry him instead.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.606
What? You're gonna marry him?

27:29.690 --> 27:32.943
[in Spanish] Now is the time, idiots!

27:33.026 --> 27:34.361
Ayúdame just got here.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.154
She doesn't know
how to distract the Reverend

27:36.238 --> 27:38.198
by asking him to rank Kid Rock songs.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.116
I'll be fine.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.325
[in Spanish] Never mind.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.370
I no longer have an icicle.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.455
You're welcome, sister.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.624
[sighs]

27:49.209 --> 27:50.294
Did it work?

27:52.754 --> 27:53.797
Wendy.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.050
I don't know you. I don't understand you.

27:57.134 --> 28:00.012
But I'm not going to let that monster
hurt another person.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.639
I'm not signing these.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.641
I knew it!

28:04.725 --> 28:06.602
He told me you were
still in love with him.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.646
Sure. If that's what you need to believe.

28:09.730 --> 28:10.898
[Wendy] Well, it is.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.191
And you can't stop me from seeing him

28:13.275 --> 28:15.402
because we're gonna be together forever.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.404
We may never get conjugal visits,

28:17.487 --> 28:19.114
but I can stay close to him

28:19.197 --> 28:23.160
because the Hampton Inn told me
that I can buy a room, like a condo!

28:23.243 --> 28:27.289
You'll never get him back,
if that's your crazy pipe dream,

28:27.372 --> 28:29.875
because he is not a fan of yours!

28:29.958 --> 28:31.710
Not a fan, Kimmy!

28:31.793 --> 28:33.295
I promised I wouldn't do this,

28:33.378 --> 28:35.130
but one of his very first compositions

28:35.213 --> 28:40.093
was a scathing haiku about... you.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.346
It's called <i>Kimmy.</i>

28:42.429 --> 28:43.847
[sighs]

28:43.931 --> 28:46.683
"I hate you, Kimmy.

28:46.767 --> 28:49.686
Shut up. Shut up.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.813
Shut up.

28:51.897 --> 28:56.860
Shut, wrecker of my joy."

29:03.659 --> 29:06.745
[groans softly]
Can I borrow a snack for the ride home?

29:06.828 --> 29:07.663
Mm.

29:09.039 --> 29:10.415
-Titus.
-Oh.

29:10.499 --> 29:11.458
Titus.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.838
[door closes]

29:25.305 --> 29:27.724
You'll still get that money
for college, Kimmy.

29:27.808 --> 29:31.270
We just have to make a cool, new app.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.355
You know that's not short
for appetizers, right?

29:33.438 --> 29:35.107
You know I don't know that!

29:35.190 --> 29:37.109
[binder slams]

29:37.693 --> 29:39.027
Wrecker of my joy.

29:43.365 --> 29:44.491
Ho-lay.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.202
What? Did something happen
to the tumbleweed?

29:48.453 --> 29:50.497
No. It's your daughter.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.041
[Fern sighs]

29:53.125 --> 29:55.544
What did I do wrong with this one?

29:55.627 --> 29:57.170
Oh, don't blame yourself.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.673
You know, I saw a white spider
the other day.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.676
I bet this is all Iktomi's doing.

30:02.759 --> 30:06.138
Oh, you can't blame Iktomi for everything.
