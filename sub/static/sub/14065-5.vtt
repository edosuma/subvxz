WEBVTT

00:01.265 --> 00:02.863
I slept with Alan Shore.
How objective can he…

00:02.863 --> 00:04.164
You also slept with me.

00:04.164 --> 00:05.630
Do you ever think that
might be part of the problem?

00:05.630 --> 00:06.838
You're a very good lawyer.

00:06.838 --> 00:08.590
But not good enough.
We're letting you go.

00:08.590 --> 00:10.951
Judge Marcia Hooper
was found murdered last night.

00:10.951 --> 00:11.982
We were having an affair.

00:11.982 --> 00:15.502
You're the man giving representation
to the person who murdered my wife.

00:15.502 --> 00:17.358
He's a nasty little man.

00:17.358 --> 00:19.436
He made her get that restraining
order against me.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.782
He made her do it.

00:20.782 --> 00:23.077
Scott Little's father is
on the prosecution's witness list.

00:23.077 --> 00:25.999
This is a pathetic attempt to be
relevant in your son's life.

00:25.999 --> 00:27.871
How could you give
testimony against him?

00:27.871 --> 00:30.254
I'm not.
At least not on the murder.

00:36.099 --> 00:40.181
Gracie Jane reporting to you live
from Boston with goosebumps.

00:40.181 --> 00:42.132
Tomorrow it happens.

00:42.132 --> 00:46.372
That low-life, adultering,
judge-murdering defendant Scott Little,

00:46.372 --> 00:48.795
who of course gets
the presumption of innocence,

00:48.795 --> 00:52.196
goes on trial, and yours truly
is here to cover it.

00:52.196 --> 00:55.818
And I will be right here,
lapping it up like a saint Bernard.

00:55.818 --> 00:58.321
Am I panting too loudly?

01:00.099 --> 01:02.215
Denny, there's a…

01:03.816 --> 01:05.302
Why are you in your bathrobe?

01:05.302 --> 01:07.388
I just had a massage.

01:07.388 --> 01:09.767
Uh, why are you holding
your briefcase?

01:09.767 --> 01:13.666
My checkbook's in it.
I needed to pay the masseuse.

01:13.898 --> 01:16.073
–Who is that under there?
–What? Where?

01:16.073 --> 01:18.151
Whoever's under there,
come out.

01:18.151 --> 01:20.346
–Go away!
–I'm not going away.

01:20.346 --> 01:22.607
Come out now.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.782
I was doing nothing untoward.

01:27.782 --> 01:30.370
I was just hiding because I didn't
want to be seen in a room with him

01:30.370 --> 01:32.088
while he's dressed in a bathrobe.

01:32.088 --> 01:35.807
So better to be seen
under the bathrobe.

01:35.807 --> 01:38.688
Who are you, Columbo?

01:39.108 --> 01:41.463
–Gracie Jane.
–What about her?

01:41.463 --> 01:44.236
She's contaminating the jury pool.

01:44.236 --> 01:47.524
Anything you can do to shut her up?

01:48.518 --> 01:50.537
Delighted to see you again.

01:50.537 --> 01:54.378
Don't you be sarcastic
with me, you snoot.

01:57.119 --> 01:59.691
My reputation's ruined.

02:07.884 --> 02:12.245
You know, uh…
this is the big third date.

02:12.245 --> 02:14.025
The kiss date.

02:14.025 --> 02:19.286
In modern times, some might say
the consummate date.

02:19.286 --> 02:21.473
Yeah, uh, Zach,

02:21.473 --> 02:24.082
there's something
you need to know about me.

02:24.082 --> 02:27.557
What's there to know,
you beautiful, funny lawyer?

02:27.557 --> 02:31.394
I'm a lawyer at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

02:31.394 --> 02:32.725
Why do I know that name?

02:32.725 --> 02:35.730
You know it because we
represent Scott Little.

02:35.730 --> 02:38.175
–You represent Scott?
–I do.

02:38.175 --> 02:42.048
Along with Jeffrey Coho,
who you've met.

02:42.393 --> 02:45.133
So all this time…

02:45.677 --> 02:46.749
How dare you?

02:46.749 --> 02:48.193
Don't lecture me.

02:48.193 --> 02:50.645
The only reason Scott Little
is going on trial

02:50.645 --> 02:55.031
is because his own doctor
sold him out to the police.

02:55.031 --> 02:57.581
You've also revealed a few choice
little nuggets to me that…

02:57.581 --> 02:59.267
I've told you nothing.

02:59.267 --> 03:04.112
Zach, you're a chatty little guy.

03:04.496 --> 03:06.668
I will make a deal with you right now.

03:06.668 --> 03:09.852
Tell me the rest of the story,
let me look at Scott's medical records,

03:09.852 --> 03:12.119
maybe give me a glance
at judge Hooper's as well,

03:12.119 --> 03:16.465
and I promise Jeffrey won't shred
you on the stand like a piece of linguini.

03:16.465 --> 03:18.879
Let me tell you something
about me, lady.

03:18.879 --> 03:20.807
Yeah, you've kissed Gina Gershon.

03:20.807 --> 03:23.053
I will not be blackmailed.

03:23.053 --> 03:26.245
Even if I were inclined to let
you see those medical records,

03:26.245 --> 03:30.181
which I most certainly am not,
I am bound by doctor-patient privilege.

03:30.181 --> 03:32.006
–Oh, now you're bound?
–Yes!

03:32.006 --> 03:35.003
It was my duty to reveal the other
because a human life was in danger,

03:35.003 --> 03:38.822
you treacherous vixen!

03:39.592 --> 03:43.222
You've made a big mistake
making an enemy of me.

03:43.597 --> 03:47.031
Hey, I am not paying for this.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.847
I will bury you.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2006/10/17

04:22.652 --> 04:24.856
Jerry, you have got to calm down.

04:24.856 --> 04:28.043
I can't help you
while you're in this state.

04:28.254 --> 04:29.516
Jerry…

04:29.516 --> 04:31.986
Goodness, I've never heard
that sound before.

04:31.986 --> 04:33.657
I've been sued.

04:33.657 --> 04:35.400
Oh, I thought I could handle it.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.234
We were in the process of effecting
a mutually acceptable settlement,

04:38.234 --> 04:41.159
when suddenly he got himself
a new, aggressive, awful,

04:41.159 --> 04:43.278
androgynous woman lawyer!

04:43.278 --> 04:46.350
Now he wants a million dollars.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.983
Jerry, what have you been sued for?

04:49.152 --> 04:51.615
One of my attorneys…

04:52.262 --> 04:55.588
as you know, I've been building
my own quiet, little firm.

04:55.588 --> 04:56.910
One of my attorneys,

04:56.910 --> 04:58.882
I terminated him,
which I'm entitled to do.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.687
It's at-will employment,
my will being dispositive.

05:01.687 --> 05:05.939
And then he filed a claim
like a snively, horrible man.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.965
What did you fire him for?

05:07.965 --> 05:11.806
He turned out to be
a scientologist, full-blown!

05:11.806 --> 05:15.147
Jerry, we do have a little thing
called freedom of religion.

05:15.147 --> 05:18.094
Oh, I know that, but why should
I have to work with one?

05:18.094 --> 05:20.917
I don't like this scientology business.

05:20.917 --> 05:22.933
Yuck, yuck, yuck!

05:31.794 --> 05:33.776
–Brad.
–Sally?

05:34.846 --> 05:37.979
–You look incredible.
–I know.

05:38.458 --> 05:41.141
–Sally.
–It's her, Androgy-woman.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.902
How you doing, old man?

05:42.902 --> 05:45.623
This is opposing counsel?

06:07.718 --> 06:09.916
You ready?

06:09.916 --> 06:11.427
Yep.

06:11.427 --> 06:13.585
Look at me.

06:15.969 --> 06:19.100
I can probably get us out of this
right now with murder two,

06:19.100 --> 06:21.956
8 to 12 years.

06:22.271 --> 06:23.762
No.

06:23.762 --> 06:27.830
Murder one means life.

06:28.742 --> 06:30.526
Are we going to lose?

06:30.526 --> 06:32.659
We may.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.147
I didn't kill her, Mr Coho.

06:38.147 --> 06:42.717
And I'm not accepting any plea
that says I did.

06:43.264 --> 06:46.294
Okay, let's go.

06:58.388 --> 06:59.803
Oh, my God.

06:59.803 --> 07:02.565
Stay tight. No comment.

07:02.565 --> 07:03.578
Okay.

07:11.524 --> 07:13.275
Mr Coho, one quick question.

07:13.275 --> 07:16.562
Rikki Klieman. Scott, is your father going
to testify for or against you?

07:16.562 --> 07:19.446
Jeffrey, Joan Rivers.
Who are you wearing?

07:28.706 --> 07:29.953
What are you planning to say?

07:29.953 --> 07:31.565
Get out of my way, Barbara.

07:31.565 --> 07:33.590
–This is your own son.
–You would never let him be my son.

07:33.590 --> 07:34.982
–You are gonna give testimony against
your own son—
–if I had raised him,

07:34.982 --> 07:37.768
he wouldn't be here now!
–Just to get back at me!
–Barbara!

07:37.768 --> 07:41.223
–I will not let you get away with this.
–Barbara.

07:46.488 --> 07:48.278
I really, really apologize.

07:48.278 --> 07:49.448
You apologize?

07:49.448 --> 07:51.987
I didn't tell her anything
that would compromise your case,

07:51.987 --> 07:52.804
I don't think.

07:52.804 --> 07:55.578
You compromised yourself,
which will compromise our case.

07:55.578 --> 07:57.735
I really, really apologize.

07:57.735 --> 08:01.629
Look, I promise I will be
the best witness you've ever had.

08:01.706 --> 08:03.464
The driveway was a crushed gravel.

08:03.464 --> 08:05.380
We were able to lift
various tire tracks,

08:05.380 --> 08:07.700
all of which belonged
to the defendant's car,

08:07.700 --> 08:09.996
the victim's and the victim's husband.
Nobody else.

08:09.996 --> 08:12.434
And, uh, what evidence
did you find in the house?

08:12.434 --> 08:14.321
The only prints inside the house
were Mr Hooper's,

08:14.321 --> 08:17.336
none of the defendant,
which is odd, since he was there.

08:17.336 --> 08:18.926
No prints of the victim even.

08:18.926 --> 08:20.104
What did that tell you?

08:20.104 --> 08:22.462
Someone was meticulous
in wiping away the evidence.

08:22.462 --> 08:25.552
Even the body had been wiped
with what appeared to be a towelette.

08:25.552 --> 08:27.536
Any evidence at all on the body?

08:27.536 --> 08:31.788
Microscopic traces of his semen
and oil secretions.

08:31.788 --> 08:33.130
The defendant's?

08:33.130 --> 08:34.947
And nobody else.

08:35.227 --> 08:38.736
How did you first learn that my client
was in the house that night?

08:38.736 --> 08:39.636
He told us.

08:39.636 --> 08:42.510
He came to you on his own
to volunteer the information.

08:42.510 --> 08:45.540
–Yes. –And other than Scott Little
being in the house that night,

08:45.540 --> 08:47.952
you have no evidence,
physical or otherwise,

08:47.952 --> 08:49.893
connecting him to the crime, do you?

08:49.893 --> 08:52.336
We have a video of him
confessing to his therapist

08:52.336 --> 08:54.862
that he had dreams of killing her.
–Yes, of course, the video.

08:54.862 --> 08:57.630
Once you saw that, Scott Little
was your man, wasn't he?

08:57.630 --> 08:58.754
He was the main suspect.

08:58.754 --> 09:00.938
The main suspect?
Who were the other suspects?

09:00.938 --> 09:02.301
He was the only viable one.

09:02.301 --> 09:04.737
Who were the others who
turned out to be non-viable?

09:04.737 --> 09:06.778
He was the only one
we considered seriously.

09:06.778 --> 09:09.812
He was the only one you
considered at all, wasn't he?

09:09.812 --> 09:12.258
Because once you saw that video,

09:12.258 --> 09:13.700
it was case closed.

09:13.700 --> 09:17.973
Because if a person dreams or
harbors fantasies of killing somebody,

09:17.973 --> 09:20.627
well, that's foolproof evidence.
Case closed.

09:20.627 --> 09:21.897
–Objection!
–Sustained.

09:21.897 --> 09:23.923
We have more than the suspect's
dreams of killing her.

09:23.923 --> 09:25.446
He was in the house
the night of the murder.

09:25.446 --> 09:27.469
–But he left before the murder.
–We don't know that.

09:27.469 --> 09:29.999
The coroner stated that
after Mrs Hooper was hit on the head,

09:29.999 --> 09:31.586
she likely died within minutes.

09:31.586 --> 09:34.141
The time of death was
between 10:15 and 10:30,

09:34.141 --> 09:37.920
but Scott Little was at home
in his house by 9:30.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.238
According to his mother.

09:39.238 --> 09:40.437
Can you refute the mother?

09:40.437 --> 09:44.002
Can you prove that he was
in the house after 9?

09:44.002 --> 09:46.047
–No, but I don't need…
–Thank you, detective.

09:46.047 --> 09:48.911
Now Mrs Hooper was having
other affairs, wasn't she?

09:48.911 --> 09:51.924
She wasn't committing adultery
only with Scott Little.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.966
–She was seeing two other men.
–That you knew of.

09:53.966 --> 09:55.988
Both of whom had verified alibis.

09:55.988 --> 09:59.476
Can you prove that these were
the only two other men

09:59.476 --> 10:00.974
that Mrs Hooper was seeing?

10:00.974 --> 10:02.372
Can I prove it?

10:02.372 --> 10:03.766
No.

10:03.766 --> 10:07.203
Thank you, detective.
Nothing further.

10:07.203 --> 10:08.746
Mr Winant?

10:08.746 --> 10:12.519
I think we'll break here and resume
again tomorrow with your next witness.

10:12.519 --> 10:14.138
Mr Winant, who do you call?

10:14.138 --> 10:16.934
The prosecution calls judge Brian Hooper.

10:21.869 --> 10:24.542
–$1 million?
–The job paid three and a quarter.

10:24.542 --> 10:27.078
When prospective employers
ask him why he was fired, he's…

10:27.078 --> 10:30.233
We're not gonna give
you a million dollars, Sally.

10:30.233 --> 10:32.234
Then I guess we go to court.

10:32.234 --> 10:38.296
Since the day you left,
I've longed to go head-to-head.

10:38.296 --> 10:40.986
You can't win this, Alan.
Freedom of religion,

10:40.986 --> 10:43.128
it's one of the biggies.

10:43.128 --> 10:46.371
I suppose we could wager.

10:46.371 --> 10:51.553
Loser has to slather the winner
in maple syrup and then lick it off.

10:51.553 --> 10:56.570
Winner gets to slather
the loser with maple syrup

10:56.570 --> 10:59.195
and then lick it off.

11:00.710 --> 11:03.672
I'll see you in court.

11:07.601 --> 11:08.407
Brad.

11:08.407 --> 11:10.639
Sally.
It's really nice to see you again.

11:10.639 --> 11:13.389
Would you like to grab
some dinner sometime, catch up?

11:13.389 --> 11:14.805
I was never behind.

11:14.805 --> 11:16.387
I'm not the same girl
you went out with, Brad.

11:16.387 --> 11:18.209
I'd love to get to know
the new girl.

11:18.209 --> 11:21.020
I think he's making his move.

11:27.641 --> 11:30.564
I used to date that woman.
That gives me the first right to redate her.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.581
I see.

11:31.581 --> 11:34.355
Well, since we're playing by high
school rules, I dated her after you did.

11:34.355 --> 11:37.558
No, you had a prurient affair with her
when she was on the rebound from me,

11:37.558 --> 11:39.046
and that doesn't count.

11:39.046 --> 11:41.947
What do you want to do,
wrestle me for her?

11:41.947 --> 11:44.230
Hands off my ex-girl.

11:58.950 --> 12:01.290
Hands, how's it going?

12:01.290 --> 12:02.728
Fine.

12:03.896 --> 12:06.065
I prefer to be called “Jerry.”

12:06.065 --> 12:07.680
Of course you do.

12:08.431 --> 12:10.645
And may I ask you a question?

12:10.645 --> 12:13.814
Well, this may be the mad cow speaking,

12:13.814 --> 12:15.829
but didn't we fire you?

12:15.829 --> 12:20.739
I left under unfortunate circumstances.
Just…

12:20.739 --> 12:21.805
Not to worry.

12:21.805 --> 12:24.535
Actually, it caused me
a lot of worry, Mr Crane.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.429
But now I've managed
to reestablish myself.

12:27.429 --> 12:30.032
I've started my own firm.
–Oh, there you go.

12:30.032 --> 12:32.852
But now I've totally blown it.
I've lost it all, so not to worry.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.654
Jerry, you're not
gonna lose your firm.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.206
Of course I am, Alan.

12:37.206 --> 12:39.436
I fired a man because of his religion.

12:39.436 --> 12:41.272
I went to three lawyers before you,

12:41.272 --> 12:43.759
because I so didn't want
to bother you again,

12:43.759 --> 12:47.137
and they all told me I can't win.

12:49.058 --> 12:51.775
You're not gonna lose your firm.

13:03.194 --> 13:04.852
He never had a problem with my work.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.313
Just the opposite.
He told me I could make partner.

13:07.313 --> 13:08.882
Then suddenly, he fired me.

13:08.882 --> 13:10.180
Did he give you a reason?

13:10.180 --> 13:13.101
He said my being a scientologist
wasn't commensurate with the image

13:13.101 --> 13:15.068
he wanted his law firm to project.

13:15.068 --> 13:16.744
He called my religion “yuck.”

13:16.744 --> 13:18.133
Your exact words.

13:18.133 --> 13:21.013
Mr Karnes, he claims you were
outspoken about your religion.

13:21.013 --> 13:22.199
That's not true.

13:22.199 --> 13:24.736
I talked about it.
I did not get on any soapbox.

13:24.736 --> 13:25.959
Talked about it in the office?

13:25.959 --> 13:27.798
Yes, but I wasn't trying
to convert anyone.

13:27.798 --> 13:29.274
I certainly wasn't a zealot.

13:29.274 --> 13:31.644
He just had a problem
with my particular faith,

13:31.644 --> 13:33.627
and he said so.

13:33.964 --> 13:35.578
Thank you.

13:39.744 --> 13:44.238
–Scientology was invented by…
–L. Ron Hubbard.

13:44.238 --> 13:46.931
Who started out as
a science fiction writer.

13:46.931 --> 13:48.545
He said, and I quote,

13:48.545 --> 13:51.766
“writing for a penny a word
is ridiculous.”

13:51.766 --> 13:55.142
“If a man really wanted
to make a million dollars,”

13:55.142 --> 13:56.280
“he'd start his own religion.”

13:56.280 --> 13:59.137
You know, people like you take
that quote way out of context.

13:59.137 --> 14:00.320
People like me?

14:00.320 --> 14:03.786
Does that mean non-believers?
Or lawyers?

14:03.786 --> 14:05.452
Foot fetishists?
–Objection.

14:05.452 --> 14:07.822
Mr Karnes, what's an engram?

14:07.822 --> 14:10.084
An engram is basically
a psychic scar.

14:10.084 --> 14:12.484
It's the, uh, origin of illness.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.541
And as I…

14:14.541 --> 14:17.717
life, according to scientology,

14:17.717 --> 14:21.367
is all about ridding yourself
of these, uh, engrams.

14:21.367 --> 14:25.431
You do this by pursuing
a path of enlightenment known…

14:25.431 --> 14:27.697
uh, help me out.
–The bridge to total freedom.

14:27.697 --> 14:30.930
And at each stage of the bridge,

14:30.930 --> 14:33.709
you are audited by
a senior church member,

14:33.709 --> 14:37.748
who hooks you up
to some electronic device.

14:37.748 --> 14:39.715
An electro-psychometer.

14:39.715 --> 14:41.831
–Is it painful?
–No.

14:41.831 --> 14:45.796
And after you go through all the stages,

14:45.796 --> 14:50.017
uh, you become an operating thetan?
theetan? thetan?

14:50.017 --> 14:51.170
That's right.

14:51.170 --> 14:53.439
And OT's, as they're called,

14:53.439 --> 14:56.732
are said to be able to
communicate with animals,

14:56.732 --> 14:59.113
move inanimate objects,

14:59.113 --> 15:01.925
leave their bodies at will.

15:01.925 --> 15:03.589
You hope to do that?

15:03.589 --> 15:05.559
One day.

15:05.559 --> 15:08.074
–Are thetans immortal?
–It's been said.

15:08.074 --> 15:12.399
Well, in fact, most scientologists
believe brother Hubbard will return.

15:12.399 --> 15:14.364
And Christians believe
Jesus will come again.

15:14.364 --> 15:16.447
Are they all nuts?
–Most.

15:16.447 --> 15:18.834
Scientologists also believe

15:18.834 --> 15:24.067
that 75 million years ago
an evil galactic warlord,

15:24.067 --> 15:27.858
and here's where I can
almost taste the maple syrup,

15:27.858 --> 15:30.617
an evil warlord by the name of Xenu

15:30.617 --> 15:35.625
dumped 13 trillion aliens from different
planets into the Earth's volcanoes

15:35.625 --> 15:38.266
and then vaporized them with h-bombs.

15:38.266 --> 15:39.726
You're familiar with this?
–Yes.

15:39.726 --> 15:44.289
And the radioactive souls of
these poor, vaporized alien creatures

15:44.289 --> 15:46.769
continue to enter into our bodies,

15:46.769 --> 15:51.157
implanting engrams and false ideas
about Christ and God and psychiatry,

15:51.157 --> 15:55.980
and that's why we have to purge
ourselves of all of these engrams.

15:55.980 --> 15:56.788
Yes.

15:56.788 --> 15:58.922
And when one releases an engram,

15:58.922 --> 16:03.690
the erasure is often accompanied
by yawns or tears, sweat, odor,

16:03.690 --> 16:07.350
panting, urine, vomiting and
other excreta. You've heard this?

16:07.350 --> 16:08.286
Yes.

16:08.286 --> 16:10.986
So basically every time you
piss, puke or crap,

16:10.986 --> 16:14.503
you're a step closer to immortality.
–Objection.

16:15.828 --> 16:18.268
Getting closer as I speak.

16:18.830 --> 16:20.608
Objection.

16:24.913 --> 16:26.070
Judge Brian Hooper,

16:26.070 --> 16:29.198
the husband of the victim,
is on the stand as we speak.

16:29.198 --> 16:31.547
You'll remember
he discovered the body.

16:31.547 --> 16:36.599
We play his frantic 911 call for you
on an average of 36 times a night.

16:36.599 --> 16:38.559
It never gets old.
Hey!

16:38.559 --> 16:39.879
I'm standing here.

16:39.879 --> 16:42.116
Well, drop dead, crime slut.

16:42.116 --> 16:44.806
Take five. Ladies…

16:46.914 --> 16:49.169
Denny Crane, as I live and drool.

16:49.169 --> 16:51.113
Got your own TV show? Wow.

16:51.113 --> 16:53.899
Yes, I do, and I don't need
the likes of you, I'll tell you that.

16:53.899 --> 16:56.815
Come on, Gracie. You're on this
campaign to convict my client.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.533
A little residual anger?

16:58.533 --> 17:01.316
Don't flatter yourself, you big goat.

17:01.316 --> 17:05.688
Come on, you and me.
Ten minutes of chubby sex.

17:06.478 --> 17:09.671
Where had you been, sir,
prior to coming home that night?

17:09.671 --> 17:11.267
I had been out to dinner.

17:11.267 --> 17:14.680
I stopped by my chambers
to get some materials,

17:14.680 --> 17:17.999
and I proceeded home,
arriving there around 11 o'clock.

17:17.999 --> 17:19.800
Do you know the defendant Scott Little?

17:19.800 --> 17:22.178
Yes, I do.
He was my wife's law clerk.

17:22.178 --> 17:25.116
–You know him personally?
–Some.

17:25.116 --> 17:27.922
He always struck me
as extremely unstable.

17:27.922 --> 17:28.768
Object.

17:28.768 --> 17:32.469
You've learned that
Mr Little and your wife had been
carrying on an adulterous affair.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.685
–Yes.
–When did you learn this, sir?

17:34.685 --> 17:36.445
The day of her death.

17:36.445 --> 17:40.246
My therapist, who is also the defendant's
therapist, informed me.

17:40.246 --> 17:41.985
What occasioned your therapist
to tell you this,

17:41.985 --> 17:44.529
betraying Scott Little's
patient confidentiality?

17:44.529 --> 17:47.223
He suddenly feared Mr Little
might harm Marcia.

17:47.223 --> 17:48.766
He gave me a disc.

17:48.766 --> 17:52.494
It showed the defendant
fantasizing about killing her.

17:52.494 --> 17:54.129
He thought it was nothing more
than a fantasy,

17:54.129 --> 17:56.736
but he couldn't be sure,

17:56.736 --> 17:58.604
and he became concerned.

17:58.604 --> 18:00.824
After you saw this disc,
what did you do?

18:00.824 --> 18:03.922
I called Marcia,
told her of the threat.

18:03.922 --> 18:06.433
We argued over the affair,

18:06.433 --> 18:12.715
and we agreed to talk that night
when I got home.

18:13.449 --> 18:15.481
But…

18:16.832 --> 18:20.958
that talk obviously never took place.

18:23.022 --> 18:25.783
When I got home…

18:29.253 --> 18:30.772
Um, I'm sorry.

18:30.772 --> 18:33.993
Your honor, perhaps a short break.

18:35.151 --> 18:36.384
“A short break”?

18:36.384 --> 18:38.664
He wants to give the jury
time to absorb the testimony.

18:38.664 --> 18:39.964
I don't think we should cross him.

18:39.964 --> 18:41.321
We have to cross him, Denise.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.933
This whole thing could just
blow up in our faces…

18:42.933 --> 18:46.256
He's a viable suspect.
We have to take the shot.

18:51.225 --> 18:52.709
Now comes the difficult part.

18:52.709 --> 18:56.179
You can plan on her cross-examining you
quite vigorously, Jerry.

18:56.179 --> 18:57.364
I'm ready.

18:57.364 --> 19:00.080
Last night I practiced
in a mock trial setting.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.274
I'm ready.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.957
You practiced?

19:02.957 --> 19:04.250
Who questioned you?

19:04.250 --> 19:07.326
Well, Patty.

19:07.326 --> 19:10.455
Patty? The doll?

19:10.455 --> 19:12.106
She didn't really question me.

19:12.106 --> 19:13.925
I supplied the questions.

19:13.925 --> 19:16.081
But she looks like
Androgy-woman a little.

19:16.081 --> 19:17.926
It was very helpful.

19:17.926 --> 19:19.546
Okay.

19:19.762 --> 19:25.238
Alan, don't you think
the resemblance is uncanny?

19:25.238 --> 19:27.522
Well, it hadn't occurred to me.

19:27.522 --> 19:29.930
Joanna the sex therapist
told me that one day

19:29.930 --> 19:33.233
I'd encounter a real, live Patty.

19:33.233 --> 19:36.146
Perhaps it's Sally.

19:37.113 --> 19:38.989
Oh, dear.

19:47.861 --> 19:49.527
I liked him personally,

19:49.527 --> 19:53.548
but his ramblings were becoming
more and more aberrant.

19:53.548 --> 19:55.514
Could you give us
an example, please?

19:55.514 --> 19:58.294
Well, he impugned me
for taking medication.

19:58.294 --> 20:01.733
Then there was the business
about the aliens.

20:01.733 --> 20:05.874
He'd request time off
to get his body audited by these

20:05.874 --> 20:08.045
electro-psychometer machines.

20:08.045 --> 20:11.467
They believe man evolved from a clam.

20:11.467 --> 20:14.221
–A clam? –The problem was
he'd talk about it openly.

20:14.221 --> 20:18.797
He was losing credibility as a lawyer,
causing my firm to lose credibility.

20:18.797 --> 20:21.121
The law business is tough.

20:21.121 --> 20:23.723
He was making a mockery of mine.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.791
He ever commit any legal malpractice?

20:25.791 --> 20:27.621
No, he's an excellent attorney,

20:27.621 --> 20:29.079
but when he talked about
his religion…

20:29.079 --> 20:30.849
It reflected poorly on the firm.

20:30.849 --> 20:32.737
I believe in religious freedom.

20:32.737 --> 20:35.800
What if one of your associates
was Hindu and worshipped a cow,

20:35.800 --> 20:38.465
would that be all right?

20:38.465 --> 20:40.215
Uh, I think so.

20:40.215 --> 20:41.680
What about Christianity?

20:41.680 --> 20:46.362
What if one of your associates believed
that Jesus actually walked on water,

20:46.362 --> 20:48.722
or that Moses parted the Red sea,

20:48.722 --> 20:52.436
or that Noah's ark actually held
60 million animals?

20:52.436 --> 20:53.911
I don't take everything
in the Bible literally.

20:53.911 --> 20:55.520
What if one of your lawyers did?

20:55.520 --> 20:59.285
Your honor, if she's making fun
of Christianity, it's unpatriotic.

20:59.285 --> 21:01.287
I'm concerned
it'll hurt the troops.

21:01.287 --> 21:04.089
Mr Shore, sit down.

21:04.268 --> 21:06.527
What if of your employees believed,

21:06.527 --> 21:10.778
instead of the soul of an alien entering
our bodies, it was the devil?

21:10.778 --> 21:14.388
Would you fire somebody from your firm
because they spoke openly about that?

21:14.388 --> 21:18.723
I am sorry, your honor.
This woman is clearly a Jew.

21:18.723 --> 21:21.371
You object to her being Jewish?

21:21.371 --> 21:24.665
I'm sure somebody here must.

21:27.532 --> 21:29.229
I don't mean to tell you
how to practice law,

21:29.229 --> 21:32.509
but at least some of the people
in that jury box go to church or temple.

21:32.509 --> 21:34.961
You can't be launching a broad
attack on religion like that.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.256
It'll alienate us!

21:36.256 --> 21:38.371
Jerry, I have to launch
a broad attack.

21:38.371 --> 21:41.984
Why? This is my career on the line.

21:41.984 --> 21:45.268
If we single out scientology,
that would make us bigots.

21:45.268 --> 21:47.449
Are we bigots, Jerry?

21:48.840 --> 21:53.701
<i>The widower reportedly will be
cross-examined not by Jeffrey Coho</i>

21:53.701 --> 21:56.891
<i>but Claire Simms, the little
princess who sits next to him.</i>

21:56.891 --> 22:00.706
<i>Ask me, I don't know why
they're crossing him at all.</i>

22:00.706 --> 22:01.747
<i>It was a—</i>

22:01.747 --> 22:04.029
Did you talk to her?

22:04.029 --> 22:06.366
I gave her my best shot.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.831
You had sex with her.

22:07.831 --> 22:09.449
Cheap sex, the best kind.

22:09.449 --> 22:11.358
What about Bethany?
Wouldn't she object?

22:11.358 --> 22:12.717
A gentleman never tells.

22:12.717 --> 22:15.724
A gentleman might want to look down.

22:15.909 --> 22:17.242
No way.

22:17.242 --> 22:19.323
Way.

22:19.323 --> 22:23.933
I knew you were there.
I was just trying to make you jealous.

22:27.167 --> 22:29.070
Denny, if she's going to be
the seventh one,

22:29.070 --> 22:32.171
you might want to go after her.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.114
Pumpkin?

22:41.437 --> 22:44.943
I testify next after judge Hooper's
cross-examination.

22:44.943 --> 22:48.948
I'm very nervous, of course,
being a chief prosecutorial witness.

22:48.948 --> 22:50.037
What do you plan to say?

22:50.037 --> 22:53.953
Mr Winant has asked me not to
make any anticipatory remarks.

22:53.953 --> 22:57.409
He doesn't want me to defuse
my thunder, of course.

22:57.409 --> 23:01.325
Suffice it to say,
I'm a very big cog.

23:01.827 --> 23:04.257
Your honor, my name is Claire Simms,

23:04.257 --> 23:07.489
and first let me convey
my sympathy for your loss.

23:07.489 --> 23:10.651
Why don't you direct
that sentiment to the jury,

23:10.651 --> 23:14.252
since it's for their benefit
that you express it?

23:14.252 --> 23:16.273
Okay.

23:16.641 --> 23:19.695
You said you regarded
my client as unstable.

23:19.695 --> 23:22.016
Did your wife share this view?

23:22.016 --> 23:23.288
I wouldn't know.

23:23.288 --> 23:26.922
Well, would it be like her to
have affairs with unstable men?

23:26.922 --> 23:30.738
Did your wife have affairs
with other men, your honor?

23:30.738 --> 23:32.050
Not to my knowledge.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.788
You never heard rumors that she did?

23:33.788 --> 23:36.579
I lend no credence
to rumors, counsel.

23:36.579 --> 23:42.011
You say you relayed Scott's fantasy
to your wife the afternoon of her death?

23:42.011 --> 23:45.978
–Yes.
–And she understood you clearly?

23:46.869 --> 23:48.154
What is that supposed to mean?

23:48.154 --> 23:50.511
Well, she made love to him that night.

23:50.511 --> 23:51.927
He probably raped her.

23:51.927 --> 23:54.273
There was no sign
of forced intercourse.

23:54.273 --> 23:56.264
Perhaps she didn't take
his fantasy seriously.

23:56.264 --> 23:58.493
We'd have to ask her.

23:59.999 --> 24:04.095
He's got keys to your house,
her chambers.

24:04.095 --> 24:07.764
And you felt he was unstable,
emotionally troubled,

24:07.764 --> 24:09.627
and now you learn of this fantasy.

24:09.627 --> 24:12.353
I don't know, if it's someone
I love, I tell the police.

24:12.353 --> 24:14.403
You tell the police, sir?
–No.

24:14.403 --> 24:17.559
And that night
you just went out to dinner.

24:17.559 --> 24:20.221
Now you said you got home
at 11 o'clock that night.

24:20.221 --> 24:25.410
Your neighbor Lincoln Meyer said he saw you
drive into your garage between 10 and 11.

24:25.410 --> 24:27.445
–He's wrong.
–Your dinner ended at 9.

24:27.445 --> 24:29.646
–I had to go to my chambers.
–Anybody see you there?

24:29.646 --> 24:30.988
I don't know.

24:30.988 --> 24:32.998
Maybe a security guard
at the courthouse.

24:32.998 --> 24:34.552
I checked.

24:34.552 --> 24:37.301
I couldn't find anybody.

24:37.301 --> 24:40.374
I've got to ask you
this question, judge.

24:40.977 --> 24:43.824
Did you kill your wife?

24:46.007 --> 24:46.952
How dare you?

24:46.952 --> 24:49.366
Well, you learned
she's having an affair,

24:49.366 --> 24:53.869
and you're told the kid she's having it
with fantasizes about killing her.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.130
And what do you do?

24:55.130 --> 24:56.895
You go out to dinner that night.

24:56.895 --> 25:00.348
Nobody can account for your
whereabouts between 9 and 11.

25:00.348 --> 25:04.581
Is it possible that you waited
for Scott Little to go to your house

25:04.581 --> 25:08.118
and leave a little semen at the scene,
after which you went in and killed her?

25:08.118 --> 25:09.486
–Objection!
–You're disgusting.

25:09.486 --> 25:11.875
You and your wife were having
marital problems, were you not?

25:11.875 --> 25:14.965
The reason she left
Dr Simon's practice,

25:14.965 --> 25:17.941
he felt he couldn't
ethically treat both of you,

25:17.941 --> 25:22.141
because it posed a conflict of interest.

25:29.913 --> 25:32.572
It's not like
I'm attracted to her.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.683
It's just that sometimes
I have to take one for the team.

25:35.683 --> 25:38.128
I think you have serious mental problems.

25:38.128 --> 25:40.128
Bethany, you and I aren't
even seeing each other yet.

25:40.128 --> 25:41.728
And I'm not going to see somebody

25:41.728 --> 25:44.691
that throws his penis around
like it's going out of style,

25:44.691 --> 25:46.630
which it probably did 50 years ago.

25:46.630 --> 25:47.789
I promise you,

25:47.789 --> 25:51.066
once I enter into
an exclusive relationship,

25:51.066 --> 25:54.168
I sleep with very few people.

25:54.432 --> 25:56.210
You know what the problem is?

25:56.210 --> 25:58.482
You're a dirty old man.

25:58.482 --> 26:00.064
Bethany!

26:01.080 --> 26:03.094
I like you.

26:03.297 --> 26:05.482
Can we give this a try?

26:05.482 --> 26:09.336
You would have to seriously
clean up your act.

26:12.699 --> 26:14.804
We're talking about freedom of religion,

26:14.804 --> 26:17.656
the most basic of individual liberties.

26:17.656 --> 26:21.543
Scientology may seem
a little wacky to Mr Espenson.

26:21.543 --> 26:22.671
So what?

26:22.671 --> 26:26.475
We never hold religion up
to standards of reasonableness.

26:26.475 --> 26:29.210
If we did,
what religion could pass?

26:29.210 --> 26:31.619
Christian scientists
won't go to the doctor.

26:31.619 --> 26:34.744
Jehovah's witnesses forbid
singing the national anthem

26:34.744 --> 26:36.451
and buying girl scout cookies.

26:36.451 --> 26:40.821
Radical Islamists blow themselves up
to meet virgins in heaven.

26:40.821 --> 26:44.896
The Hindus have their cow.
People believe in all kinds of things.

26:44.896 --> 26:49.257
It is their right to do so
under the First Amendment.

26:49.257 --> 26:52.988
But the defendant doesn't want
to afford that liberty to Douglas Karnes

26:52.988 --> 26:58.431
because he thinks that scientology
is just a little too out there, I guess.

26:58.431 --> 26:59.620
Come on.

26:59.620 --> 27:04.066
Freedom of religion means just that.

27:04.066 --> 27:06.304
Oh, please.
It's a dumb freedom.

27:06.304 --> 27:10.401
An employee's behavior reflects on
their employer, for God's sake.

27:10.401 --> 27:12.056
In this case, we're talking
about a law firm,

27:12.056 --> 27:15.557
a business in which clients look for
good judgment, sound and sane counsel.

27:15.557 --> 27:17.776
This guy's running around saying
man evolved from a big clam

27:17.776 --> 27:19.827
after galactic warlords
invaded our volcanoes.

27:19.827 --> 27:21.627
He's a nut job,

27:21.627 --> 27:25.477
and I don't know about you,
but I'm getting a little tired
of this freedom of religion thing.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.905
When did religion get
such a good name anyway?

27:27.905 --> 27:31.501
Be it the Crusades,
the reformation genocides,

27:31.501 --> 27:33.104
the troubles in Northern Ireland,

27:33.104 --> 27:36.766
the Middle east, mass slaughters
supposedly in the name of Allah,

27:36.766 --> 27:39.776
and then, of course, the obligatory
reciprocal retributions.

27:39.776 --> 27:43.245
Hundreds of millions of people
have died in religious conflicts.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.697
Hitler did his business
in the name of his creator.

27:45.697 --> 27:48.424
9/11 was an act of
religious extremism.

27:48.424 --> 27:51.495
It's our greatest threat today,
a holy Jihad.

27:51.495 --> 27:55.568
If we're not ready to strip religion
of its sacred cow status,

27:55.568 --> 27:58.059
how about we at least
scale back a little

27:58.059 --> 28:01.318
on the constitutional dogma
exalting it as all get-out?

28:01.318 --> 28:05.051
Your honor, I would love to know what
this has to do with my client being fired.

28:05.051 --> 28:08.326
Your client was fired because he
entered into an at-will employment contract,

28:08.326 --> 28:10.021
he acted like a complete loon,

28:10.021 --> 28:12.405
and he now tries to cloak himself
in a Constitutional Amendment

28:12.405 --> 28:15.094
that is as overplayed
as it is misapplied.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.569
Everybody should get
to believe in God,

28:17.569 --> 28:20.283
pray to his God,
worship his God, of course.

28:20.283 --> 28:23.844
But to impose him on others,
to victimize others in his name,

28:23.844 --> 28:27.958
the founding fathers of this country
set out to prevent persecution,

28:27.958 --> 28:29.828
not to license it.

28:29.828 --> 28:32.081
And for Jerry Espenson,

28:32.081 --> 28:35.227
struggling with his law practice
to make ends meet,

28:35.227 --> 28:37.081
don't tell me he's not victimized

28:37.081 --> 28:41.307
when one of his lawyers bounces around
telling clients and other attorneys

28:41.307 --> 28:44.769
that according to his most recent
electro-psychometer reading,

28:44.769 --> 28:46.455
he's getting closer to immortality,

28:46.455 --> 28:49.293
at which point he'll be able
to leave his body and talk to zebras.

28:49.293 --> 28:51.450
At a certain point, we have to say,

28:51.450 --> 28:55.798
“enough with this freedom of
religion crap. Yuck, yuck!”

28:56.022 --> 28:57.813
Yuck.

29:01.857 --> 29:04.509
Yes, I know.
I'll get letters.

29:10.539 --> 29:12.328
Not going to steal my thunder.

29:12.328 --> 29:15.294
She was a lovely woman.
That's all I'll say.

29:15.294 --> 29:18.911
I hope I can be a cog
in convicting her killer.

29:18.911 --> 29:21.624
Not going to steal my thunder.

29:21.624 --> 29:24.550
–He had his very own clicker.
–“Clicker”?

29:24.550 --> 29:28.062
A remote so he could covertly
pull into her garage.

29:28.062 --> 29:30.810
I'd see him pull in,
and I'd watch him pull out.

29:30.810 --> 29:33.350
–“Him” being?
–The boy.

29:33.350 --> 29:35.318
The boy was her favorite.

29:35.318 --> 29:37.106
And by “boy,” you mean
the defendant Scott Little?

29:37.106 --> 29:42.630
Many times I'd look through the window
and see them doing it like apes.

29:42.630 --> 29:44.998
You'd see the defendant
and Mrs Hooper make love?

29:44.998 --> 29:47.155
It was often angry.

29:47.155 --> 29:49.284
–Angry?
–Oh, yes.

29:49.284 --> 29:52.425
Sometimes it looked like
he was trying to hurt her.

29:52.425 --> 29:56.665
And she seemed to take pleasure
in the physicality of his wrath.

29:56.665 --> 30:00.364
In fact, I think she rather
got off on feeling punished.

30:00.364 --> 30:02.415
He seemed to enjoy hurting her,

30:02.415 --> 30:06.307
so it made for some
very passionate, ape-like sex.

30:06.307 --> 30:07.550
This isn't good.

30:07.550 --> 30:10.364
Now you didn't actually see them
make love the night of the murder?

30:10.364 --> 30:11.275
No.

30:11.275 --> 30:15.014
But I definitely saw him
arrive at 8-ish.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.405
–Did you see anybody else?
–No.

30:17.405 --> 30:19.904
I'd seen others on various occasions.

30:19.904 --> 30:21.769
Some had their own clickers.

30:21.769 --> 30:23.385
But on the night of the murder,

30:23.385 --> 30:29.312
only him and the husband,
who arrived about 11, I think.

30:29.312 --> 30:31.105
Thank you, sir.

30:32.131 --> 30:35.006
We'd better get this guy.

30:35.503 --> 30:37.730
You and I have had several conversations,
haven't we, Lincoln?

30:37.730 --> 30:39.856
We have.
I don't like you.

30:39.856 --> 30:42.141
You never told me
the lovemaking was angry.

30:42.141 --> 30:44.027
Didn't I? Sorry.

30:44.027 --> 30:46.738
I have to wonder if you were
saving this for trial.

30:46.738 --> 30:49.489
You're very excited about being
a big cog, aren't you, Lincoln?

30:49.489 --> 30:51.172
I'd say anxious,

30:51.172 --> 30:54.141
anxious to see her brutal
murderer brought to justice.

30:54.141 --> 30:57.756
You told Denise Bauer you saw the
husband get home between 10 and 10:30.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.546
I said no such thing.

30:59.546 --> 31:01.564
She's obviously twisted my words.

31:01.564 --> 31:04.152
–She twisted your words?
–Yes.

31:04.152 --> 31:05.912
That's what all lawyers do.

31:05.912 --> 31:07.551
Were you obsessed with Marcia Hooper?

31:07.551 --> 31:09.300
I was enamored.
She was lovely.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.312
–Were you in love with her?
–I adored her.

31:11.312 --> 31:13.709
Why'd she get a restraining
order against you?

31:13.709 --> 31:14.525
Her husband.

31:14.525 --> 31:16.346
In her affidavit,
she called you “sick.”

31:16.346 --> 31:17.952
He made her write those things.

31:17.952 --> 31:21.583
I'll bet it was kind of hard to
watch her make love to all those men.

31:21.583 --> 31:24.986
–Peepies love watching.
–You brought her flowers a lot.

31:24.986 --> 31:26.270
She adored my flowers.

31:26.270 --> 31:29.072
Yet she called you “sick, unbalanced.”

31:29.072 --> 31:30.959
His words.

31:30.959 --> 31:33.524
When's the last time you
brought her flowers, Lincoln?

31:33.524 --> 31:36.178
I don't really recall.

31:36.389 --> 31:37.722
You grew these flowers?

31:37.722 --> 31:40.259
In my garden.
They're lovely.

31:41.153 --> 31:44.000
Your flowers again, Lincoln?

31:45.951 --> 31:48.585
Sure look like yours.

31:49.231 --> 31:51.240
You were in the house, Lincoln.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.203
You go in after Scott left?
–Don't be ridiculous.

31:54.203 --> 31:55.365
These are your flowers.

31:55.365 --> 31:57.665
I gave them to her outside
that afternoon.

31:57.665 --> 31:59.715
Oh, now you suddenly remember.

31:59.715 --> 32:01.660
You kill her, Lincoln?
–Mr Coho…

32:01.660 --> 32:04.304
–Clearly she made you angry.
–She did not make me angry.

32:04.304 --> 32:05.491
–She called you “sick.”
–No.

32:05.491 --> 32:06.720
–“Unbalanced.”
–His words!

32:06.720 --> 32:09.645
–No, Marcia's.
–She was drawn to me.

32:09.645 --> 32:10.903
Drawn to you?

32:10.903 --> 32:14.346
An effeminate loser who plays
in his garden all day?

32:14.346 --> 32:16.867
You're a peeping Tom, for God's sakes!

32:16.867 --> 32:18.923
You should be a registered sex offender!

32:18.923 --> 32:20.511
You're a weird little pervert!

32:20.511 --> 32:23.140
You watch your mouth,
you dirty mouth!

32:23.140 --> 32:24.547
You watch your mouth!

32:24.547 --> 32:27.281
–Or what, you'll kill me?
–Objection!

32:31.334 --> 32:35.877
Somebody ought to wash
your dirty mouth out with soap.

32:55.967 --> 32:57.756
Does he always pace like that?

32:57.756 --> 33:01.635
If they come back with a number
above the policy, he's out of business.

33:01.635 --> 33:03.462
Which is why you should have settled.

33:03.462 --> 33:05.388
And waste all that syrup?

33:05.388 --> 33:07.868
Madame foreperson,
the jury has reached a verdict?

33:07.868 --> 33:09.688
–We have, your honor.
–What say you?

33:09.688 --> 33:13.969
We the jury, in the matter
of Karnes vs Espenson,

33:13.969 --> 33:15.916
find in favor of the defendant.

33:15.916 --> 33:19.154
Oh, thank God!
Oh, my God.

33:19.154 --> 33:20.837
Thank you! Thank you all!

33:20.837 --> 33:21.641
Thank you!

33:21.641 --> 33:23.482
The court thanks
the jury for its service.

33:23.482 --> 33:25.610
You are dismissed.

33:30.305 --> 33:31.929
And thank you.

33:31.929 --> 33:38.260
Someday I'm going to pay you back for
your continued kindness, you kind, kind man.

33:42.212 --> 33:44.233
I'm gonna go now.
Would that be all right?

33:44.233 --> 33:46.493
It would.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.299
Congratulations.

33:59.202 --> 34:01.561
I will beat you one day.

34:01.561 --> 34:04.804
I'd much rather be flogged.

34:06.177 --> 34:10.565
If memory serves me,
according to our wager…

34:14.016 --> 34:16.139
You lick.

34:27.686 --> 34:30.989
Would you describe your relationship
with your son as estranged?

34:30.989 --> 34:34.742
I would describe it
as almost non-existent.

34:34.742 --> 34:36.058
My wife saw to that.

34:36.058 --> 34:37.971
You and your wife were divorced
when Scott was 3.

34:37.971 --> 34:40.518
Yes, and I was granted
very little access.

34:40.518 --> 34:42.678
She controlled him.
She dominated him, isolated him.

34:42.678 --> 34:46.047
Mr Schiller, you told police you visited
your ex-wife two months ago.

34:46.047 --> 34:48.404
It wasn't a visit
so much as an encounter.

34:48.404 --> 34:50.533
She brought a civil action
to garnish my wages.

34:50.533 --> 34:52.965
I went to confront her,
and as I approached the house,

34:52.965 --> 34:54.904
I heard them arguing.

34:54.904 --> 34:56.358
Who?

34:56.358 --> 34:58.170
Scott and his mother.

34:58.170 --> 35:00.432
Could you hear what was being said?

35:00.432 --> 35:02.942
Yes, she was, uh, screaming at him,

35:02.942 --> 35:06.626
saying that adultery
was a sin and so forth.

35:06.626 --> 35:09.782
She was accusing him of loving
whoever the woman was,

35:09.782 --> 35:11.107
and he was denying it.

35:11.107 --> 35:14.721
So according to his mother,
Scott was in love with this woman.

35:14.721 --> 35:15.976
Objection.
Calls for hearsay.

35:15.976 --> 35:17.521
–Excited utterance.
–I'll allow it.

35:17.521 --> 35:19.022
–Your honor…
–I'll allow it.

35:19.022 --> 35:21.914
Mr Schiller, prior to the day
you heard them arguing,

35:21.914 --> 35:24.651
when was the last time
you saw your son?

35:24.651 --> 35:26.110
Two years ago.

35:26.110 --> 35:28.254
It was a futile attempt
on my part to reconnect.

35:28.254 --> 35:29.927
We went on a trip together to New York.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.792
It didn't go well?

35:31.792 --> 35:33.733
No, we had to end it abruptly.

35:33.733 --> 35:36.374
Could you tell us what happened?

35:36.725 --> 35:38.562
Um…

35:38.562 --> 35:41.166
I, uh…

35:41.521 --> 35:43.375
I was out,

35:43.375 --> 35:46.851
and when I returned
to the hotel room,

35:46.851 --> 35:49.505
I inadvertently walked in on him.

35:49.505 --> 35:51.956
What was he doing?

35:53.153 --> 35:55.582
He was gratifying himself.

35:55.582 --> 35:58.172
–He was masturbating?
–Yes.

35:58.172 --> 36:00.376
He jumped up.

36:00.376 --> 36:03.284
We pretended I didn't see what I saw,

36:03.284 --> 36:07.630
and he went to the bathroom.
And I noticed on the bed…

36:07.630 --> 36:10.387
a picture and a woman's sweater.

36:10.387 --> 36:12.984
A picture of?

36:16.440 --> 36:17.685
A naked woman.

36:17.685 --> 36:22.157
Did you recognize the woman
in the photo?

36:22.157 --> 36:24.343
Yes.

36:24.343 --> 36:27.365
It was his mother.

36:27.558 --> 36:30.559
And it was one of her sweaters.

36:30.559 --> 36:33.569
And that's when I knew for sure
what I'd suspected for a long time.

36:33.569 --> 36:36.113
Which was?

36:36.113 --> 36:41.427
Scott was sexually attracted
to his mother.

36:41.427 --> 36:44.994
And he was deeply in love with her.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.305
–Objection.
–Overruled.

36:46.305 --> 36:49.077
Scott Little was in love
with his own mother?

36:49.077 --> 36:51.680
Yes.

36:52.097 --> 36:54.570
And when I saw the picture of the victim,

36:54.570 --> 36:56.903
how much she looked like Barbara,

36:56.903 --> 37:00.090
I realized that Scott was
probably carrying on

37:00.090 --> 37:03.258
some sick, twisted version
of the love affair

37:03.258 --> 37:06.141
he'd always wanted to have
with his mother, for which I blame her!

37:06.141 --> 37:08.401
Objection.
Speculation. Foundation?

37:08.401 --> 37:11.352
Sustained. The jury will disregard
that last statement.

37:11.352 --> 37:13.219
–My son is very ill.
–Objection!

37:13.219 --> 37:16.962
Sustained. Mr Schiller, you will not offer
psychological testimony.

37:16.962 --> 37:19.379
I have nothing further.

37:24.704 --> 37:26.512
Your honor, I need more time.

37:26.512 --> 37:30.259
We'll adjourn and resume
at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

37:31.614 --> 37:33.292
You can't let the jury sleep on that.

37:33.292 --> 37:36.062
Denise, I need more time.

37:55.232 --> 37:57.738
I'm not in love with you.

37:57.738 --> 38:01.380
Not, uh, not like that.

38:01.380 --> 38:06.789
How did you get a naked
picture of me, Scott?

38:06.789 --> 38:08.854
You were sunbathing once by the pool.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.904
You didn't know I was home…

38:10.904 --> 38:13.243
and I photographed you.
–Why?

38:13.243 --> 38:16.080
You just, um…

38:16.080 --> 38:20.758
the sun, the way the light, uh…

38:21.929 --> 38:25.852
I just thought it would make
for a good picture.

38:29.121 --> 38:30.931
Scott…

38:31.793 --> 38:34.222
is this what you were afraid
we would discover

38:34.222 --> 38:37.784
if we opened Dr Simon's files,
that you, um,

38:37.784 --> 38:39.515
have feelings for your mother?

38:39.515 --> 38:41.826
Okay, ick and double ick.

38:41.826 --> 38:44.751
I think we should move for
a mistrial on unfair surprise.

38:44.751 --> 38:47.653
We won't get it, but we should
at least preserve it on appeal.

38:47.653 --> 38:49.241
–What happens now?
–What happens now?

38:49.241 --> 38:50.992
You fill out your
change-of-address forms!

38:50.992 --> 38:53.569
–I didn't kill her!
–Oh, gee, there's some rage.

38:53.569 --> 38:55.415
You shut up!

39:20.771 --> 39:24.168
You can do this,
you can do this.

39:31.113 --> 39:33.272
Mr Espenson?

39:33.939 --> 39:37.302
I realize this is extremely,
extremely forward of me,

39:37.302 --> 39:41.143
and I apologize deeply
for any intrusion,

39:41.143 --> 39:45.033
but you remind me
so very much of…

39:45.033 --> 39:48.037
–Alan?
–Jerry.

39:48.385 --> 39:50.423
I'm terribly sorry.
Good-bye.

39:50.423 --> 39:51.912
Jerry, wait.

39:52.470 --> 39:54.093
Jerry…

39:54.864 --> 39:56.183
Je…

40:01.285 --> 40:05.228
I feel so badly for him.

40:05.228 --> 40:08.425
The courage it took for him
to actually go to her door.

40:08.425 --> 40:10.434
Awful.

40:12.387 --> 40:15.139
He still has the doll
as backup, right?

40:15.139 --> 40:18.227
<i>Please, let's keep in mind
he gets a presumption of innocence,</i>

40:18.227 --> 40:21.862
<i>'cause nothing says “not guilty”
like a pervert mama's boy</i>

40:21.862 --> 40:24.505
<i>who dreams about
committing murder.</i>

40:24.505 --> 40:25.873
My God.

40:25.873 --> 40:28.351
I thought you wielded
some influence with this woman.

40:28.351 --> 40:31.273
Well, she's, she's always
had that problem.

40:31.273 --> 40:32.726
She surrenders,

40:32.726 --> 40:35.115
and then she's ready to
go back to war again

40:35.115 --> 40:37.419
the minute I withdraw my soldier.

40:37.419 --> 40:39.067
Maybe you should take her to dinner.

40:39.067 --> 40:40.543
No can do.

40:40.543 --> 40:42.602
I'm involved.

40:42.832 --> 40:43.742
Sorry?

40:43.742 --> 40:46.135
I asked Bethany out.
We're a couple.

40:46.135 --> 40:47.426
The little person?

40:47.426 --> 40:50.471
Yeah, she's so brazen and ballsy,

40:50.471 --> 40:52.063
and she takes no prisoners.

40:52.063 --> 40:54.908
She reminds me of somebody
I used to know years and years ago.

40:54.908 --> 40:57.359
–Who?
–Me.

40:57.359 --> 40:59.678
Oh, I like her, Alan.

40:59.678 --> 41:01.616
Something special's happening here.

41:01.616 --> 41:03.468
I feel giddy.

41:03.468 --> 41:07.404
The only thing more exciting than meeting
a new woman is running into an old one.

41:07.404 --> 41:09.107
Sally Heep.

41:09.107 --> 41:12.624
What is it about young girls?

41:13.560 --> 41:17.261
We look at ourselves through their eyes
and feel relevant instead of…

41:17.261 --> 41:19.459
Old and fat.

41:19.459 --> 41:20.922
I must admit, Denny,

41:20.922 --> 41:24.144
I don't like it that there's
a huge trial going on in this firm,

41:24.144 --> 41:26.694
and you and I
aren't front and center.

41:26.694 --> 41:30.089
It makes it difficult to
remember that in life,

41:30.089 --> 41:32.953
it's all about me.

41:36.320 --> 41:40.154
–We haven't lost it, have we?
–Don't be silly.

41:40.154 --> 41:46.060
Oh, we may be less relevant,
but we're rich and famous.

41:46.060 --> 41:48.436
We still got it, Alan.

41:49.004 --> 41:51.657
Of course we do.

41:54.091 --> 41:56.614
What is it we still got?

41:56.614 --> 41:58.573
Young girls.
