Oh! Yeah!

00:42.006 --> 00:43.172
Yeah!

00:45.326 --> 00:46.775
We made a drink!

00:46.777 --> 00:48.177
- Yeah!
- Excuse me.

00:48.179 --> 00:49.878
Excuse me! Hey!

00:49.880 --> 00:52.615
Uh... can I get a drink here or what.

00:58.922 --> 01:00.022
Here you go.

01:00.024 --> 01:01.614
Happy birthday, Craig.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.224
Retirement. Thanks.

01:05.738 --> 01:06.761
Whoops!

Your ankle is the size of a grapefruit.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.877
How did you not realize it was sprained?

01:22.879 --> 01:24.379
I mean, by that point in the night,

01:24.381 --> 01:26.481
I wasn't feeling much of anything.

01:26.483 --> 01:28.749
I learned that tequila is an upper...

01:28.751 --> 01:30.851
I feel like it was, like, psychological,

01:30.853 --> 01:32.587
like the Gazebo effect.

01:32.589 --> 01:34.388
<i>Placebo</i> effect?

01:35.530 --> 01:37.324
Yeah. Yeah.

01:37.326 --> 01:39.393
I thought that you said
you were working.

01:39.395 --> 01:42.062
It was just, like, a
really lame catering gig,

01:42.064 --> 01:43.530
so we were, like, trying
to make the most of it.

01:44.933 --> 01:46.766
Thank you so much
for coming over, Lesley.

01:46.768 --> 01:48.968
You're the best girlfriend...

01:48.970 --> 01:51.938
Whoa, girlfriend?

01:51.940 --> 01:54.971
- Yeah. I mean, or partner. I like...
- You...

01:54.982 --> 01:56.767
- I like "girlfriend."
- You know, this...

01:56.778 --> 01:58.978
I think this actually brings up
an interesting point.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.081
"Partner." Yeah. "Partner"
is more lesbian.

02:01.083 --> 02:04.084
- No, no. Abb... Please don't... Abbi.
- I... I... Like, I know this now.

02:04.086 --> 02:06.253
I actually think that...

02:06.255 --> 02:09.455
that we should stop doing...

02:09.458 --> 02:11.657
this.

02:11.659 --> 02:13.126
Wait, okay. Okay.

02:13.128 --> 02:15.561
Is this about the...
the "placebo" thing...

02:15.563 --> 02:20.209
No, Abbi, it's... It's a
lot bigger than that.

Hunter freaking College, bish.

I'm in, Hunter College. I'm freaking in!

02:58.973 --> 03:00.973
Well, Master's.

03:00.975 --> 03:02.931
Whoo! Grad student.

03:04.879 --> 03:09.482
Acceptance letter!

03:09.484 --> 03:10.820
Whoo!

03:24.531 --> 03:25.846
Hello.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.455
Can I help you?

03:29.536 --> 03:32.870
I hear you offer student discounts.

03:32.872 --> 03:34.839
So, we can't give you a student discount

03:34.841 --> 03:38.410
if you don't have a student ID,
and this isn't a student ID.

03:38.412 --> 03:41.813
Okay, but this says that I <i> will</i> be
a student in like three months.

03:41.815 --> 03:43.014
Oh, three months?

03:43.016 --> 03:45.850
Oh, that's almost as long as we've
been having this conversation.

03:45.852 --> 03:48.386
Okay, Zahm Zena. Do we have a beef?

03:48.388 --> 03:49.921
Oh, my God, miss?

03:49.923 --> 03:52.723
- Okay. Jesus. I'm leaving.
- Oh, no, you're not.

03:52.725 --> 03:55.459
Your hair. It's perfect.

03:55.461 --> 03:58.662
The curls are so plump yet so light.

03:58.664 --> 04:00.631
<i> Moi?</i>

04:00.633 --> 04:02.566
<i>Merci beaucoup, monsieur.</i>

04:02.568 --> 04:04.019
I know this is crazy,

04:04.037 --> 04:06.888
but would you consider modeling for us?

04:06.899 --> 04:09.606
Stop. Okay, stop. Is this
some sort of perverted prank?

04:09.608 --> 04:11.375
Are you in on this... 'Cause you've
been a bitch the whole time?

04:11.377 --> 04:14.044
I know this is last-minute,
but we're doing a shoot tonight.

04:16.949 --> 04:18.548
You know what? I think that'll be good.

04:18.551 --> 04:20.916
Perfection... Just like your curls.

04:20.918 --> 04:23.721
See you back here at 6:00
and be camera ready.

04:23.723 --> 04:26.156
Okay, 6:00 P.M., camera ready.

04:26.158 --> 04:29.117
Oh, my God, did you see that?
That was amazing.

04:29.128 --> 04:30.675
I'm on a call right now. I can't talk.

04:30.686 --> 04:32.753
Okay, something seems
very locked up inside of you,

04:32.764 --> 04:36.166
so when you decide to change your
life with therapy, give <i> me</i> a call.

04:38.170 --> 04:39.635
I don't understand.

04:39.637 --> 04:42.805
Like, Lesley, I-I like you so much.

04:42.807 --> 04:44.875
We're just not on the same page.

04:44.877 --> 04:46.142
I'm a doctor.

04:46.144 --> 04:49.296
I do jiu-jitsu and have hobbies.
And you...

04:49.307 --> 04:51.975
You just don't really feel
like an adult yet.

04:51.986 --> 04:54.584
And I'm sure your life is fun,

04:54.586 --> 04:58.588
but it's really just kind of
a series of wild shenanigans.

04:59.912 --> 05:00.956
Wow.

05:00.958 --> 05:02.491
Shenanigans?

05:02.493 --> 05:06.962
You're 20s are for...
wild "shenanigans."

05:06.964 --> 05:08.370
But aren't you 30?

05:09.776 --> 05:11.600
Wow, wow. You're fucking nuts, Lesley!

05:11.602 --> 05:13.202
- What?!
- Yeah. Yeah, you're nuts.

05:13.204 --> 05:16.538
I'm just saying that you need
to grow up a little bit.

05:16.540 --> 05:18.274
Mm. Okay. Yeah. No, no, no. Yeah.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.510
You know what... I write
thank-you notes all the time.

05:21.512 --> 05:23.178
And my phone screen isn't even cracked.

05:23.180 --> 05:25.106
And guess what, Lesley?
I'm going to a play today.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.102
- I'm going to a matinée.
- Yeah, with Ilana's parents,

05:27.113 --> 05:28.724
who, I'm assuming, paid for the tickets.

05:28.735 --> 05:30.652
Actually, you know what, Lesley?
I think that we're done.

05:30.654 --> 05:32.521
I think that you should
get out of my house.

05:32.523 --> 05:34.956
Finally on the same page
about something.

05:37.756 --> 05:42.063
You know what? Why don't you take
your ugly-ass hat back, too.

05:42.065 --> 05:43.864
Fine. I will.

05:43.866 --> 05:47.468
Of course it looks cute on you.
Whatever. God!

05:47.470 --> 05:50.004
Oh, shit!

05:50.006 --> 05:52.573
Great. Well, thanks a lot. Now I
<i>do</i> have a crack in my screen,

05:52.575 --> 05:56.044
- thanks to your stupid boot.
- Oh, did the wig not protect it?

05:57.747 --> 05:59.780
It didn't.

06:03.353 --> 06:07.270
DevaCurl?! Oh, my freakin' God, Ilana!

06:07.281 --> 06:09.957
- I know. I know!
- You're gonna be a model.

06:09.959 --> 06:12.225
I literally could not
have done this without you guys.

06:12.227 --> 06:14.100
Also, I got into grad school today.

06:14.111 --> 06:15.563
What? That's fantastic.

06:15.565 --> 06:18.398
DevaCurl! Ah! Oh! I'm
coming to the shoot.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.076
Of course you're coming.
You're my number-one curl inspo.

06:21.087 --> 06:23.671
DevaCurl. Ah.

06:23.673 --> 06:25.339
DevaCurl!

06:25.341 --> 06:28.175
Devacu-u-u-u...

06:32.915 --> 06:34.381
uuuuuuuur...

06:43.032 --> 06:45.397
Yeah. That is adult.

06:45.408 --> 06:48.710
Whoo! She got the plaid slacks.
She got the pink sweater.

06:48.712 --> 06:50.445
She got the tortoise-shell clip, bish.

06:50.447 --> 06:52.588
- Yass! I love it!
- Oh, my gosh. Hold on.

06:52.599 --> 06:54.199
Is this a grad student?

06:54.210 --> 06:56.076
- Oh, well, mm... Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Mm!

06:56.087 --> 06:58.586
- Yes!
- I'm so proud of you, dude.

06:58.588 --> 07:00.060
- Congrats!
- Thank you!

07:00.071 --> 07:02.639
And you must be my sexy professor.

07:02.650 --> 07:04.983
Wow, Lesley is a true monster

07:04.994 --> 07:07.395
if she can break up with you
looking like this.

07:07.406 --> 07:09.906
Yeah, well... she said
I'm not "adult" enough

07:09.917 --> 07:11.384
- for her, so...
- Oh!

07:11.395 --> 07:14.262
I didn't realize she was
a fucking heinous bitch.

07:14.273 --> 07:16.145
She smells like fucking shit.

07:16.156 --> 07:18.880
- She doesn't smell like shit.
- Always hated her... never liked her.

07:18.891 --> 07:20.875
Listen, it's fine, because
I have been flooding

07:20.877 --> 07:23.610
my Instagram account
with adult-ass pics all day

07:23.612 --> 07:25.579
so she can see what
she's missing out on.

07:25.581 --> 07:28.081
Wow. I love it. Hence <i> The New Yorker.</i>

07:28.083 --> 07:30.213
Hence <i> The New Yorker,</i> indeed.

07:30.224 --> 07:32.285
Whatever. Enough about Lesley, okay?

07:32.287 --> 07:34.463
Okay, so, um... I am scared

07:34.474 --> 07:36.122
that my brother is leaving the city.

07:36.124 --> 07:37.924
You know, I-I know that
he's obviously going

07:37.926 --> 07:39.853
to be the perfect Jewish-Canadian VJ...

07:39.864 --> 07:42.606
I'm sorry. Is your eye okay?

07:42.617 --> 07:45.200
I'm just going for, like, a
structured architectural brow today.

07:45.211 --> 07:47.814
No, no. Like, it's red. It
looks really irritated.

07:47.825 --> 07:49.836
Yeah, I got this, like,
AC drop in my eye before.

07:49.838 --> 07:52.739
It was just, like, air conditioning
pre-cum... like Ninja Turtle juice.

07:52.741 --> 07:54.307
It's fine.

07:54.309 --> 07:55.711
Is it, though?

07:55.722 --> 07:58.577
Yeah, I'll just flush it out
when I cry at the play later.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.047
O-o-oh!

08:01.049 --> 08:03.749
Oh, my God!

08:03.751 --> 08:06.096
I didn't tell you the best news of all.

08:07.155 --> 08:11.057
Lordy, lordy... ♪ 'Cause Janet be 40 ♪

08:11.059 --> 08:14.760
Yep, yep, yep, yep! Whoo-whoo!

08:14.762 --> 08:17.363
- What?
- Girl, I got scouted...

08:17.365 --> 08:20.033
to model... for Devachan.

08:20.035 --> 08:21.951
Okay? Whoo!

08:21.962 --> 08:23.703
- This is the Vision Board.
- That's it.

08:23.714 --> 08:24.828
- Yes!
- Yes!

08:34.615 --> 08:37.616
Oh, here she is!

08:37.618 --> 08:41.807
My star... my DevaCurl star.

08:42.557 --> 08:43.738
No, we had a wild night.

08:43.749 --> 08:47.025
Eliot, your sister
is a DevaCurl hair model!

08:47.027 --> 08:48.744
I mean, this is really, very exciting

08:48.755 --> 08:50.729
about the modeling, but, please...

08:50.731 --> 08:53.298
let us not forget
this is Eliot's special day.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.501
It is bon voyage to New York.

08:55.503 --> 08:57.035
My favorite neighborhood, no less...

08:57.037 --> 08:59.019
the Theater District.

08:59.030 --> 09:01.006
Would it kill you to put a
smile on your pretty face?

09:01.008 --> 09:03.476
You have a simply spectacular smile...

09:03.478 --> 09:05.844
- my sweet baby.
- Hey, hey, hey, lady.

09:05.846 --> 09:09.180
You want a picture with my daughter?
She's a very famous hair model.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.949
Can we just go inside, please?

09:10.951 --> 09:13.017
Yeah, you know, we got
to cash in on this, El.

09:13.019 --> 09:17.054
I mean, one of those whats-their-faces
is worth, like, a billion dollars.

09:17.056 --> 09:21.192
You know, you really should
be putting weight on the good foot.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.227
Yeah, but it's... I wanted the heel,

09:23.229 --> 09:25.029
so it just, like, works.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.665
Look at how fast you're going. Good job.

09:28.554 --> 09:30.301
Hey, girls.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.371
Hungry?

09:33.373 --> 09:34.572
She's a professional.

09:52.136 --> 09:54.761
Someone's making a dank Instagram story.

09:55.061 --> 09:56.960
Yes, it's a story about a grown

09:56.962 --> 09:59.630
woman at the theater.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.065
Theater, yes.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.167
It's starting. Damn it.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.846
I'm so sick of this attic!

10:08.331 --> 10:11.275
Walk it off, Anne Frank!

10:17.248 --> 10:19.040
Please enjoy a brief intermission.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.903
Wow.

10:20.914 --> 10:22.313
They're gonna win that Tony.

10:22.324 --> 10:27.857
Oh, my God. Dude... Does your eye stink?

10:29.127 --> 10:30.493
Hoo!

10:30.495 --> 10:32.662
Yeah, it stinks. What's going...

10:32.664 --> 10:34.664
Holy shit! Ilana...

10:34.666 --> 10:36.313
It smells like prosciutt.

10:36.324 --> 10:38.421
You cannot go to the
DevaCurl shoot like this.

10:38.432 --> 10:40.002
You got to go to a doctor right away

10:40.004 --> 10:42.363
and get this cleared up,
for the family honor!

10:42.374 --> 10:44.265
Doctor? I don't have a "doctor" "here."

10:44.276 --> 10:45.680
Wait, you don't have a doctor here?

10:45.691 --> 10:47.761
No one in the city does.
That's why it's a cesspool.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.849
All right, it's an emergency!
Go to the emergency room.

10:49.860 --> 10:51.346
- Go to St. Vincent's.
- It's condos.

10:51.348 --> 10:52.880
- All right, so Cabrini!
- Also condos.

10:52.891 --> 10:54.784
How 'bout that what's-his-name
doctor on Houston St.?

10:54.786 --> 10:56.218
It's not condos, but it's a Whole Foods.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.354
- Again, why do you love this city?
- You got to get an ambulance.

10:59.356 --> 11:01.148
You... You smell like a dog's ass.

11:01.159 --> 11:02.803
- What'd you say?
- A dog's ass.

11:02.814 --> 11:04.794
Dog's ass... That's it?

11:04.796 --> 11:06.201
- What?
- Mwah!

11:06.212 --> 11:08.497
Okay, I know who can cure me.
I got this.

11:08.499 --> 11:10.032
Oh, I hope so.

11:10.034 --> 11:12.468
Oh, God.

11:12.470 --> 11:16.105
Save me! Come on.

11:21.928 --> 11:24.228
Hey, can you drive me downtown
and just weave

11:24.230 --> 11:25.530
in and out of traffic very fast?

11:25.532 --> 11:27.299
Listen, I'm not a pedicab driver.

11:27.301 --> 11:29.200
I'm a real estate broker. Read the sign.

11:29.202 --> 11:31.068
Okay, then why do you have a pedicab?

11:31.070 --> 11:32.837
It's the fastest way to get clients

11:32.839 --> 11:34.872
to apartments for multiple viewing.

11:34.874 --> 11:37.342
You know, I think I-I know you.

11:37.344 --> 11:39.076
- Are you a cop?
- No.

11:39.078 --> 11:42.180
But you showed my friend and
I an apartment years ago,

11:42.182 --> 11:43.782
a bunch of shitty apartment.

11:43.784 --> 11:46.250
I mean, they were
all literal crime scenes.

11:46.252 --> 11:48.420
Oh, yeah, crime scene homes
are my speciality.

11:48.422 --> 11:51.873
You know, I got an ex that works
in the NYPD. He hooks me up.

11:51.884 --> 11:53.758
I just give him a hand job
once and a while.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.928
Okay, since we have a history
can I please get a ride?

11:55.939 --> 11:57.594
This is a modeling emergency.

11:57.596 --> 11:59.864
Look, I've been pedaling
my butt off all day.

11:59.866 --> 12:01.098
I mean, look at my feet.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.567
Oh, Jesus Christ.

12:03.569 --> 12:05.536
Wait a minute. Flex that thigh.

12:05.538 --> 12:07.138
Whoopsie!

12:07.140 --> 12:08.639
I can see your short and curlies.

12:08.641 --> 12:10.007
Let's go!

12:11.177 --> 12:12.376
Damn.

12:12.378 --> 12:13.945
There you go. You got it.

12:13.947 --> 12:16.047
You should see your ass from back here.

12:16.049 --> 12:19.217
It's amazing. It looks like a big heart.

12:19.219 --> 12:22.286
- Thank you, Pam... Move! Scram!
- Oh, let's go!

12:22.288 --> 12:24.055
We have a medical emergency!

12:24.057 --> 12:26.157
- Look out for the baby... the baby!
- Get out of the way!

12:30.128 --> 12:33.129
Well, well, well, Lesley.

12:33.131 --> 12:35.598
One of these babies could've been yours.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.600
Shit.

12:37.602 --> 12:39.736
Lighting is terrible in here.

12:39.738 --> 12:43.073
Gotta find another light... source.

12:53.151 --> 12:55.051
Yes! Daylight.

12:56.355 --> 12:57.754
Here we go.

12:57.756 --> 13:00.323
Lesley's not gonna know what hit her.

13:09.443 --> 13:11.976
Shenanigans.

13:14.487 --> 13:15.719
Okay.

13:18.224 --> 13:19.857
Oh, my God. Yes.

13:19.859 --> 13:23.194
Ah! Yes!

13:24.397 --> 13:26.497
Hello? Somebody?

13:26.499 --> 13:27.865
H-Hello?

13:27.867 --> 13:30.168
Abbi? It's Lesley.

13:30.170 --> 13:35.472
Hey. Lesley.

13:37.176 --> 13:39.776
What's up... girl?

13:45.446 --> 13:48.151
Okay, I'm sorry. I have to
go before you. I'm a model.

13:49.555 --> 13:52.789
- The doctor's with a patient!
- Yeah, I'm a model.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.124
S-Stop!

13:55.126 --> 13:57.026
Doctor... Ohh! Sorry.

13:57.028 --> 13:58.562
Ilana, I told you...

13:58.564 --> 14:01.717
I can not spay-neuter a human,
and it is not reversible.

14:01.728 --> 14:04.501
No, I-I Googled that...
you were right about it.

14:04.503 --> 14:06.102
I'm here about this.

14:07.539 --> 14:10.339
Ugh. Okay.

14:10.341 --> 14:12.875
That looks bad. Have a seat.

14:12.877 --> 14:14.711
Okay, good girl. Good girl.

14:14.713 --> 14:16.278
Good... Good girl!

14:16.280 --> 14:19.949
Well, I actually wanted
to apologize to you.

14:19.951 --> 14:21.383
For before.

14:21.385 --> 14:23.319
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.855
Oh, did you see my Instagram?

14:25.857 --> 14:29.025
- What?
- Never mind. Wh-Wh-What's up?

14:30.435 --> 14:35.589
Look, the truth is,
I'm really set in my ways,

14:35.600 --> 14:38.701
and maybe I'm self-sabotaging
this whole things

14:38.703 --> 14:41.370
because I have a lot of fun with you...

14:41.372 --> 14:42.972
shenanigans and all.

14:42.974 --> 14:45.274
<i>I mean, who am I to
judge the way you live?</i>

14:45.276 --> 14:47.243
<i>You know, you're...
you're figuring it out.</i>

14:47.245 --> 14:51.079
Wow. Well, thanks...

14:51.081 --> 14:52.548
I mean, thank you for saying that.

14:52.550 --> 14:54.717
I...

14:54.719 --> 14:57.085
You really hurt my feelings
this morning.

14:57.087 --> 14:59.855
I know, and I'm so sorry.

14:59.857 --> 15:03.726
Do you think there's any way
that we can try this again?

15:03.728 --> 15:05.728
You mean, like, get back together?

15:05.730 --> 15:08.264
<i>Yes. I'd really like
to keep seeing you, Abbi.</i>

15:08.266 --> 15:09.698
I think you're great.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.433
<i>Well, I think you're great, too.</i>

15:11.435 --> 15:15.837
I mean, what are you, uh...

15:17.584 --> 15:19.908
What are you doing tonight?

15:19.910 --> 15:22.577
Well, I think I may have a date

15:22.579 --> 15:26.581
with my very adult,
very sexy artist girlfriend.

15:26.583 --> 15:29.785
Yeah. I mean, I'm down to...

15:29.787 --> 15:31.419
hang.

15:31.421 --> 15:35.133
<i>Um, before we lock in any logistics...</i>

15:35.144 --> 15:37.993
I've, u-um...

15:37.995 --> 15:40.561
gotten myself in
a little bit of trouble.

15:42.532 --> 15:45.834
But, uh, I do need...
I do need you to call 9-1-1.

15:45.836 --> 15:47.669
- What?
- <i>And then you know what?</i>

15:47.671 --> 15:51.439
You pick dinner. It's totally on you.
I'm cool with whatever.

15:51.441 --> 15:53.675
Jesus Christ, Abbi.

15:53.677 --> 15:56.477
You know, I've gotten New
York City water droplets

15:56.479 --> 15:58.446
in my mouth before, and I was fine.

15:58.448 --> 16:01.182
I did have bloody stool
for a week or two,

16:01.184 --> 16:03.083
but that's pretty typical
for me in the summer.

16:03.085 --> 16:05.123
Well,<i> this</i> is conjunctivitis.

16:05.134 --> 16:06.209
- No!
- Yes.

16:06.220 --> 16:08.723
You cannot get any closer
than this to anyone.

16:08.725 --> 16:10.491
Please! I have a photoshoot tonight.

16:10.493 --> 16:11.968
What if I'm paired with a curly-haired,

16:11.979 --> 16:13.661
non-binary model, and it's a love scene?

16:13.663 --> 16:15.196
- And a little bit of a pinch.
- Mm!

16:15.198 --> 16:16.831
One, two, three.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.790
- Okay.
- Hey! Thank you.

16:18.801 --> 16:20.401
Okay, so this is gonna clear up my eye

16:20.403 --> 16:21.922
and make me "gorgus" for the evening.

16:21.933 --> 16:24.986
No, that's your third
round of Hep B shots.

16:24.997 --> 16:26.914
You have another one
scheduled for next month..

16:26.925 --> 16:28.706
- Okay.
- I'm gonna write you a prescription.

16:28.717 --> 16:31.946
And this is gonna clear your
eye up in about two weeks.

16:31.948 --> 16:34.849
Two fuggin' weeks?! No, no, no!

16:34.851 --> 16:36.984
Look, honey, I'm a model now,

16:36.986 --> 16:39.019
and this here is my money maker.

16:39.021 --> 16:40.687
Don't you have something
quicker, like...

16:40.689 --> 16:43.190
bovine growth hormone that
Madonna shoves up her crack?

16:43.192 --> 16:45.625
I need something that
will clear me up tonight.

16:45.627 --> 16:47.394
There is one option.

16:47.396 --> 16:48.996
Work those curls, Mama.

16:48.998 --> 16:51.065
Nasty little duet. Yeah!

16:51.067 --> 16:52.733
Kinky, kinky.

16:52.735 --> 16:55.269
Give me a... realness. Volume, volume.

16:55.271 --> 16:58.538
Yes. Work it, Mama.
Yeah, Shirley Temple.

16:58.540 --> 17:00.807
Now lose the glasses, baby.

17:03.278 --> 17:04.743
Uh... Cut the music!

17:04.746 --> 17:07.413
What's with the patch? What is this?

17:07.415 --> 17:09.462
Today I'm serving, um...

17:09.473 --> 17:11.251
"Kill Bill" realness.

17:11.252 --> 17:13.386
Yeah, more like Bob Costas realness.

17:13.387 --> 17:15.154
Lose the patch.

17:15.165 --> 17:18.090
You don't want to see what's under here.

17:18.093 --> 17:20.760
- Well, then the shoot's over.
- Whoa, whoa. What's the problem?

17:20.762 --> 17:22.060
Uh, and who are you?

17:22.063 --> 17:24.763
- I'm the manager/mother.
- Stop it.

17:24.766 --> 17:28.501
You're curls make your daughter's
curls look like trash.

17:28.502 --> 17:32.071
The rare triple helix...
the Holy Grail of curls.

17:32.073 --> 17:33.539
You must sleep sitting up.

17:33.541 --> 17:35.707
Of course I do, I'm not an animal.

17:35.709 --> 17:38.210
This is really last minute,
but we're totally in a bind.

17:38.922 --> 17:41.268
You could save the day.

17:44.018 --> 17:47.119
Whoo! You own everything.

17:47.121 --> 17:50.655
Louis Vuitton, CHANEL.

17:50.657 --> 17:55.027
All right... Yaas! Slay Curl Kween!

17:55.029 --> 17:57.462
For the family honor.

17:59.133 --> 18:01.466
"The cast is electric"?

18:01.468 --> 18:03.349
What an idiot.

18:19.486 --> 18:21.319
Wow.

18:54.899 --> 18:59.626
Okay, so this psycho dumped you
a second time in one day

18:59.637 --> 19:02.170
while you're hanging
between two buildings,

19:02.172 --> 19:04.306
two stories above concrete?

19:04.308 --> 19:06.308
- This bitch is a menace.
- Right?

19:06.310 --> 19:09.554
But then there was, like, this
fire woman that was rescuing me.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.232
She was, like, carrying me down,
and I was, like...

19:14.648 --> 19:16.484
"Who are you?" Like, she was hot.

19:16.486 --> 19:19.021
- Yas.
- It's cool that I can see that now.

19:19.023 --> 19:23.025
I mean, the female form...
God's hottest creation.

19:23.027 --> 19:24.731
Oh, yeah... "Made in Her image."

19:24.742 --> 19:27.662
It's a Catholic thing.

19:27.664 --> 19:30.198
Man, I'm just so bummed
my modeling career

19:30.200 --> 19:31.533
is over before it started.

19:31.535 --> 19:34.836
But my mom was incredible.

19:34.838 --> 19:36.271
- Wow.
- She slayed.

19:36.273 --> 19:39.207
I got to show you. Oh, my God.
She posted all about it.

19:39.209 --> 19:40.642
Who's that? Huh?

19:40.644 --> 19:42.144
Aww. Eliot.

19:43.646 --> 19:46.780
God, everybody's moving away, huh?

19:46.782 --> 19:49.417
But not the most important one.

19:49.419 --> 19:51.419
The most important person...

19:51.421 --> 19:53.087
... of my life.

19:53.089 --> 19:55.056
I'd give everybody else up.

19:56.359 --> 19:57.825
Yeah.

19:57.836 --> 19:59.893
Show me... Why don't you
show me pictures of your mom,

19:59.895 --> 20:01.329
- 'cause I didn't see it.
- Yeah, I didn't even give it to ya.

20:01.331 --> 20:02.496
Here.

20:02.498 --> 20:04.498
Holy shit.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.566
Wow.

20:05.568 --> 20:07.068
I'm like, "Go, girl!"

20:07.070 --> 20:09.503
Slay, girl. Work it, girl.

20:09.505 --> 20:11.672
"Covergirl! Slay, Mama!"

20:11.674 --> 20:12.906
- Covergirl!
- Covergirl!

20:12.908 --> 20:14.675
- Be the curl.
