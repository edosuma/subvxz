08:55.049 --> 08:57.029
[cheers and applause]

08:57.049 --> 08:58.139
- How you doing?

08:58.159 --> 09:00.039
- Hi!

09:01.139 --> 09:02.220
- I'm happy to be here.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.200
- Thank you so much
for joining us, Anthony.

09:04.220 --> 09:06.230
I know that you have been
exposed to COVID,

09:07.009 --> 09:09.149
therefore you can't be
in this room with us.

09:09.169 --> 09:13.100
The last time that we saw you,
you were handing over a key

09:13.120 --> 09:15.159
to Faith
to your New York place.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.019
And you were like,
"Baby, here you go.

09:17.039 --> 09:18.200
You got the keys;
come out to New York."

09:18.220 --> 09:20.159
How would you define
the relationship

09:20.179 --> 09:22.080
with you and Anthony today?

09:23.179 --> 09:26.120
- Uh...
[laughs]

09:26.139 --> 09:29.129
Um, I don't know
how to answer that question.

09:29.149 --> 09:31.169
Take this one.
[laughs]

09:31.190 --> 09:34.019
- Are you two still together?

09:34.039 --> 09:36.179
- Well, things didn't go
exactly as planned.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.080
A little after we left
the castle, you know,

09:39.100 --> 09:41.029
2020's just been crazy.

09:41.049 --> 09:43.000
COVID hit, it's been tough
fighting through the distance.

09:43.019 --> 09:46.059
So me and Faith, we're still
working out certain things,

09:46.080 --> 09:47.200
and it's still possible

09:47.220 --> 09:49.220
that something special
can happen with me and her.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.190
- Faith,
is that how you see it?

09:51.210 --> 09:55.039
You two are or are not
still together?

09:55.059 --> 09:56.100
- No, we're not together.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.000
Um, we are both single.

09:59.019 --> 10:02.049
- Did you guys make an effort
to make it work, do you feel?

10:02.070 --> 10:05.009
- Yeah, I mean, I was willing
to uproot my life to New York,

10:05.029 --> 10:06.120
so, I mean, I don't think

10:06.139 --> 10:09.080
that there's much more
you can do besides that.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.120
- Well, what went wrong?

10:10.139 --> 10:12.019
Did you ever make it
to New York?

10:12.039 --> 10:13.200
- Like he said, you know,
2020 with COVID,

10:13.220 --> 10:15.190
it's been--it's been hard.

10:15.210 --> 10:19.029
We can't just jump on a flight
like we could have beforehand.

10:19.049 --> 10:20.090
- I mean, to be fair though,

10:20.110 --> 10:21.210
I jumped on a flight
to get here,

10:21.230 --> 10:24.159
so there are flights
still going.

10:24.179 --> 10:26.019
So do you feel like

10:26.039 --> 10:28.029
there was something
that was holding you back

10:28.049 --> 10:32.019
from making the full-on move
from LA to New York?

10:32.039 --> 10:35.090
- Um, so me,
I work, uh...

10:35.110 --> 10:37.110
I might not work
as fast as certain people.

10:37.129 --> 10:39.009
Some people, they see
each other, they're like,

10:39.029 --> 10:40.139
"All right,
let's make this happen."

10:40.159 --> 10:42.049
At the time I was like,
"Come to New York."

10:42.070 --> 10:44.009
But then you also have to
take a step back like,

10:44.029 --> 10:45.200
"Are you rushing this?"
That's a big decision,

10:45.220 --> 10:48.210
for me to make her move all
the way from LA to New York.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.039
- Okay,
so I want to ask you this.

10:51.059 --> 10:55.049
With regard to the kiss--
or kisses--with Chad,

10:55.070 --> 10:57.200
what do you feel now
after seeing the show?

10:57.220 --> 11:00.230
Do you feel that you
overreacted about the kiss,

11:01.009 --> 11:03.129
or do you feel that, you know,
your reaction was warranted?

11:03.149 --> 11:04.220
- My action was warranted,

11:05.000 --> 11:06.100
because it was never
about the kiss.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.220
The kiss doesn't mean
anything to me.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.090
The thing was,
I wasn't given certain facts.

11:11.110 --> 11:13.049
It was just a messy situation

11:13.070 --> 11:15.129
and I just wasn't informed
of what was happening.

11:15.149 --> 11:17.179
I just would like us
to be truthful to each other

11:17.200 --> 11:20.100
so that we can establish
a certain relationship.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.019
- I want Anthony to know
that, like,

11:22.039 --> 11:25.220
I never, ever, ever was trying
to hide something at all.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.019
I felt guilty being
put in a position as a lead

11:28.039 --> 11:29.149
and not being open-minded.

11:29.169 --> 11:32.019
And so I'm going to try
to be open-minded.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.139
I tried doing that.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.159
And then Chad
genuinely thought I, like,

11:35.179 --> 11:37.100
had feelings for him.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.090
The way it's all pieced
together just makes it look

11:39.110 --> 11:41.059
even more messy
and, like, crazy.

11:41.080 --> 11:44.059
And at the time, look,
it was Chad or Kevin, so...

11:44.080 --> 11:47.190
[laughs]
Sorry, Kevin.

11:47.210 --> 11:50.070
- I hear you, and I've also
been involved

11:50.090 --> 11:52.110
in reality TV as well, right?

11:52.129 --> 11:55.039
So we know that, you know,
sometimes you do things,

11:55.059 --> 11:57.039
you look back at it on camera,
and go, "Oh, man,

11:57.059 --> 12:00.230
that's not representative
of who I completely am."

12:01.009 --> 12:02.230
But it felt like you guys
did have

12:03.009 --> 12:05.149
a real--at least
some type of connection.

12:05.169 --> 12:10.190
Chad, how did you feel about
your connection with Faith?

12:10.210 --> 12:13.100
- I mean,
let's get the story straight.

12:13.120 --> 12:17.159
I do believe
that at some point

12:17.179 --> 12:19.230
we all have to stand
by our actions.

12:20.009 --> 12:21.210
Do I think that it was
a strong connection at all?

12:21.230 --> 12:26.190
No. But to backtrack at all,
after the fact,

12:26.210 --> 12:32.049
all of it--I mean,
that's her prerogative.

12:32.070 --> 12:34.000
- Faith,
do you feel like you gave

12:34.019 --> 12:37.200
all of the guys
a real fair shot?

12:37.220 --> 12:39.200
- No.
[laughs]

12:39.220 --> 12:42.210
I 100% will admit that.

12:42.230 --> 12:45.049
I tried doing that with Chad
and give someone a chance

12:45.070 --> 12:47.110
that I wouldn't normally
give a chance,

12:47.129 --> 12:50.120
and then that got fucked up.

12:50.139 --> 12:52.120
And so then after that I think
I was just like,

12:52.139 --> 12:54.000
"All right, I'm not doing
that anymore."

12:54.019 --> 12:55.029
I was like,
"I'm sticking to what I like,

12:55.049 --> 12:57.039
and I'm going for it."

12:57.059 --> 12:58.080
- If there's anyone
that you could go back

12:58.100 --> 12:59.200
and give a second chance to,

12:59.220 --> 13:03.000
who would you want
to get to know better?

13:03.019 --> 13:06.080
- I definitely felt bad
for Aaron,

13:06.100 --> 13:09.080
because he came so late
into the game.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.009
Anthony already had my heart
at that point,

13:11.029 --> 13:14.059
and I just--I felt bad,
because he's such a nice guy,

13:14.080 --> 13:16.129
and he's just like
the sweetest human.

13:16.149 --> 13:19.059
I just--I felt bad;
he didn't have enough time.

13:19.080 --> 13:22.210
- I think that we shared
some great conversations

13:22.230 --> 13:24.120
and connected in various ways,

13:24.139 --> 13:27.210
but like she said, you know,
her heart was elsewhere.

13:27.230 --> 13:29.169
- Is there anyone who felt
like they didn't get

13:29.190 --> 13:32.190
a fair shot with Faith?
- Yeah.

13:32.210 --> 13:36.009
- Tell me why you feel like
you didn't have a fair shot.

13:36.029 --> 13:39.019
- I might be too pale.
Um...

13:39.039 --> 13:41.149
[laughter]

13:41.169 --> 13:44.009
I think that Kevin, Wells,
and I

13:44.029 --> 13:45.139
all share something in common

13:45.159 --> 13:48.139
and that isn't really
on the top of Faith's list.

13:48.159 --> 13:49.230
- I was like, "You know what?

13:50.009 --> 13:51.210
I think that she has
a special type,

13:51.230 --> 13:54.159
and I think that she's
interested in the melanin,

13:54.179 --> 13:57.049
or should I say
the "mela-men," okay?

13:57.070 --> 14:01.149
So, Anthony, do you feel then
it was you who called off

14:01.169 --> 14:03.159
the relationship,
or was it Faith?

14:03.179 --> 14:06.039
- I don't know.
I want to say it's mutual,

14:06.059 --> 14:08.120
but I think there was more
hesitation on my side.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.100
- Faith, I saw you lift
that "you said that,

14:10.120 --> 14:11.190
you said that" finger.

14:11.210 --> 14:14.009
Do you agree
with what Anthony is saying?

14:14.029 --> 14:15.159
- I still want us to work.

14:15.179 --> 14:19.070
I want--I would love for us
to make it work.

14:19.090 --> 14:23.190
- Faith, how did it feel when,
you know, Anthony said,

14:23.210 --> 14:26.220
you know, "Never mind,
don't move to New York.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.230
Maybe we should take
a second on this"?

14:29.009 --> 14:31.000
- It's disappointing that
it didn't work out, obviously.

14:31.019 --> 14:34.019
Like, he captured my heart
in a way that no one else has.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.120
It's heartbreaking, you know,
when you see a future

14:36.139 --> 14:40.029
with someone
and that future is ripped away,

14:40.049 --> 14:41.179
like, it's shitty.

14:41.200 --> 14:46.019
But I will always
have his back...

14:56.120 --> 14:57.190
- Look, me and Faith

14:57.210 --> 14:59.190
haven't even known
each other a year yet.

14:59.210 --> 15:02.019
We're still a work-in-progress.
There's no reason

15:02.039 --> 15:04.029
that we should have to rush
our relationship.

15:04.049 --> 15:05.230
We still talk every day;
we're still

15:06.009 --> 15:08.049
the best of friends,
and we're still building.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.210
So I don't think
that there's anything wrong

15:09.230 --> 15:11.039
with taking a step back,

15:11.059 --> 15:12.210
getting to know
each other first,

15:12.230 --> 15:14.100
and then making it happen.

15:14.120 --> 15:17.029
- Well, Anthony, I hear you
on that 100%, okay.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.100
It's nothing wrong
with getting to know people,

15:19.120 --> 15:22.110
but it just feels like
you gave me this moment

15:22.129 --> 15:26.029
where you were like,
"Move to New York, be my boo."

15:26.049 --> 15:30.059
And now today it's, like,
not happening.

15:32.039 --> 15:33.200
- I think when anything
works out the way

15:33.220 --> 15:36.169
that you don't want it to,

15:36.190 --> 15:38.220
it's disappointing,
and I agree.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.009
Like, I think we're in
a great place right now,

15:41.029 --> 15:44.210
and I think
it's something to...

15:44.230 --> 15:47.000
to just keep moving forward.

15:47.019 --> 15:48.080
That's all we can do.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.000
- I mean, it's not my place
to judge

15:50.019 --> 15:53.169
but looking from the outside,
I mean,

15:53.190 --> 15:55.039
we all fell in love
with the couple

15:55.059 --> 15:56.149
that you guys grew to be.

15:56.169 --> 15:59.070
And after hearing what,

15:59.090 --> 16:02.169
you know, Faith has just been
so vulnerable and open about,

16:02.190 --> 16:05.149
I felt that Anthony was very
hesitant and still closed off

16:05.169 --> 16:08.129
on a lot of the things
he really wanted to say.

16:08.149 --> 16:10.039
So I mean, Faith,

16:10.059 --> 16:12.070
don't you think
you deserve better?

16:15.149 --> 16:17.169
- Anthony is being
really vulnerable.

16:17.190 --> 16:19.200
For him to say "I love you"
to someone,

16:19.220 --> 16:22.019
that's him really
putting himself out there.

16:22.039 --> 16:25.000
So I think if you know him,
like,

16:25.019 --> 16:27.009
you know that takes a lot
for him.

16:27.029 --> 16:30.210
- Faith, I'm in love with you,
and you already know that.

16:30.230 --> 16:33.159
- Anthony, I love you.

16:33.179 --> 16:36.049
- Thank you, Faith and Anthony,
for being so generous

16:36.070 --> 16:37.159
and so honest with us.

16:37.179 --> 16:39.159
We really do appreciate it,
and as a viewer,

16:39.179 --> 16:41.090
I have to say
I've enjoyed your journey,

16:41.110 --> 16:43.120
and I'm still going to be
checking in, okay?

16:43.139 --> 16:45.120
- Yeah, thank you so much.

16:45.139 --> 16:47.059
- There is so much more
to come.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.149
Oh, honey, when we come back,

16:48.169 --> 16:50.070
we're going to get right
into my good friends

16:50.090 --> 16:53.220
Chad and Garrett, and all
the juicy gossip they're in.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.200
Ooh, but right now,
I need to get me a drink.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.139
Waiter!
Baby!

16:57.159 --> 16:59.139
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:59.159 --> 17:02.139
- Corey!
- Can I bring my drink?

17:02.159 --> 17:04.099
I'll bring my drink.
- I don't like it.

17:04.119 --> 17:06.029
It's embarrassing for her.

17:06.049 --> 17:07.099
- Faith deserves better.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.029
This is bullshit.

17:09.049 --> 17:11.210
- He says things to keep her
holding on.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.029
He said, "I love you."

17:13.049 --> 17:14.109
She said,
"I want to marry you."

17:14.130 --> 17:15.170
- Right.
- He said, "I love you too."

17:15.190 --> 17:16.230
- Right.
- But they're not--

17:17.009 --> 17:18.069
- You need the words
and the actions.

17:18.089 --> 17:19.150
She's making the risk.
- Right.

17:19.170 --> 17:21.079
- She's moving from LA
to New York.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.200
- Yes!
- He doesn't lose anything!

17:22.220 --> 17:24.039
- Yeah.
- If they break up, he lives

17:24.059 --> 17:25.069
in the same apartment...
- Yep.

17:25.089 --> 17:26.190
- Same ZIP code.
- Yep.

17:26.210 --> 17:28.190
- It hurts me to see her ready
to literally

17:28.210 --> 17:30.079
make a commitment...
- Yeah.

17:30.099 --> 17:33.029
- And then Anthony
just doesn't want to yet.

17:33.049 --> 17:34.130
- She's putting it
all out there.

17:34.150 --> 17:37.009
- Yeah.
- Like, on the show and now.

17:37.029 --> 17:38.049
- Right.
- Like, she's been like,

17:38.069 --> 17:39.109
"I love you,
I'll move for you."

17:39.130 --> 17:41.049
What has he done for her?

17:41.069 --> 17:45.109
[indistinct chatter]

17:45.130 --> 17:47.029

17:47.049 --> 17:49.200
honestly, you make
my little homosexual heart

17:49.220 --> 17:51.230
just flutter, all right?

17:52.009 --> 17:54.049

you are harder to hold on to

18:04.049 --> 18:07.180
Unpacking that
is really difficult.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.029
- Even though you didn't
end up taking anyone home,

18:10.049 --> 18:12.039
you certainly had a choice.

18:12.059 --> 18:14.029

to continue this.

the hope away,

you made me question
my worth as a person,

ended it with Corey earlier

there was not a spark?

to make
a decision that night, so...

that she just gave you,

tell you

21:16.009 --> 21:17.059
how I felt by what you did,

21:17.079 --> 21:18.140

I'm doing right now.

- Corey, what are you

kind of every other situation

for being Black

in wanted this more than you.

thank you for showing up.

your experience

22:13.230 --> 22:17.059
in the castle
with my friend Garrett here?

22:17.079 --> 22:18.210
- I realized after
the first conversation

22:18.230 --> 22:21.059
that I just didn't have
chemistry with Garrett,

22:21.079 --> 22:22.220
and there wasn't a spark there.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.019
And it was something
that I knew for myself

22:26.039 --> 22:27.140
I didn't want to pursue.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.150
- Garrett, what about that
turned you on?

22:29.170 --> 22:31.200
[laughter]

22:31.220 --> 22:34.019
I mean, it seems like
a very odd question

22:34.039 --> 22:35.150
to ask anybody, right?

22:35.170 --> 22:38.069
However, in watching the show,
I would make the assumption

22:38.089 --> 22:39.180
that, well,
if you're not into Garrett,

22:39.200 --> 22:41.089
he gonna come after you,
but if you're into him,

22:41.109 --> 22:43.180
watch out, 'cause it's not
going to work out.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.119
So clarify that for me,
or set me straight.

22:46.140 --> 22:48.089
- I was hoping for a friendship

22:48.109 --> 22:49.220
to form
out of Dominick; I was--

22:50.000 --> 22:51.089
- But you came here
looking for love.

22:51.109 --> 22:54.140
- Of course, but once I said
goodbye to Jose,

22:54.160 --> 22:58.200
I knew that with the dates
that I had in the castle

22:58.220 --> 23:00.230
that I was not going
to be choosing anyone.

23:01.009 --> 23:04.029
I also was not just gonna bring
anyone home for Christmas.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.190
I want to make sure
that who I bring home,

23:06.210 --> 23:10.009
it's a real,
genuine connection.

23:10.029 --> 23:11.150
- Zach,
you have something to say?

23:11.170 --> 23:13.230
- I do.
The one thing you say about me

23:14.009 --> 23:17.059
is that we had
great conversation,

23:17.079 --> 23:18.220
and then you keep the person

23:19.000 --> 23:21.029
who literally said
they want to go home.

23:21.049 --> 23:24.230
And I'm not bitter,
because--I'll take your words,

23:25.009 --> 23:27.029
Corey--I don't want
to talk to someone

23:27.049 --> 23:29.150
who doesn't want to talk to me.

23:29.170 --> 23:31.220
[applause]

23:32.000 --> 23:33.190
- Okay, help me out then.

23:33.210 --> 23:36.160
What really happened
that just tore apart

23:36.180 --> 23:39.099
the relationship
between you and Jose?

23:39.119 --> 23:42.019
Because I will tell you,
in watching it, I was invested.

23:42.039 --> 23:43.210
I was like, "Ooh, yes, honey,
I'm about to be

23:43.230 --> 23:46.150
probably officiating
a new gay marriage!"

23:46.170 --> 23:48.119
I was about to get my booking,
okay?

23:48.140 --> 23:50.200
So what was that moment?

23:50.220 --> 23:54.069
- It was that night when you
came into the room

23:54.089 --> 23:55.220
with the producers in there,

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
and you had a few drinks,
and it pushed me over the edge.

24:00.019 --> 24:02.150
I just felt like
you weren't fully seeing

24:02.170 --> 24:05.230
what does turn me off
and what does set me back

24:06.009 --> 24:09.049
after I had kind of just
went through that with Corey.

24:09.069 --> 24:12.180
- He was literally taking me
on a roller coaster.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.059
It's like, "Oh, it's, like,
well, maybe we can

24:14.079 --> 24:15.170
make it work, like, this way."

24:15.190 --> 24:17.000
He's like, "But actually,
no, we can't."

24:17.019 --> 24:18.059
It's like, "But maybe we can."

24:18.079 --> 24:20.130
Or, "No, I guess we cannot."
[laughs]

24:20.150 --> 24:23.029
Which is why I was
very confused at the end of it.

24:23.049 --> 24:24.069
- You know what?

24:24.089 --> 24:26.029
I was a little confused
at home,

24:26.049 --> 24:29.130
because I saw--Garrett,
you said goodbye to Jose.

24:29.150 --> 24:31.009
Jose, you left saying,

24:31.029 --> 24:33.039
"You know what? This is why
he can't be trusted."

24:33.059 --> 24:35.170
And then when you were invited
to come home,

24:35.190 --> 24:37.210
all of a sudden,
you were back in love with him

24:37.230 --> 24:39.049
and showing your heart again.

24:39.069 --> 24:42.099
Was there ever
an off-camera hook up,

24:42.119 --> 24:44.220
something else that happened
that made you feel like,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.009
"You know what?
Yeah, this is going to work"?

24:47.029 --> 24:48.220
- Yeah.
- Yes.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.039
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

I knew my crystal ball
wasn't wrong.

24:53.089 --> 24:54.170
Now, wait a minute.
So where did this happen,

24:54.190 --> 24:56.220
in Louisiana, or in the castle?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.130
- It happened in Louisiana.

24:58.150 --> 25:02.170
- So there was another reunion
before mama's house? Right?

25:02.190 --> 25:04.029
- Yeah.
- That--where it happened.

25:04.049 --> 25:05.190
Okay.
And there was a lovely session

25:05.210 --> 25:09.019
and then y'all--now then you
came back to the house,

25:09.039 --> 25:10.180
and you thought,
"This is going to work."

25:10.200 --> 25:12.160
Well, thank you
for clarifying for me.

25:12.180 --> 25:14.059
But, Garrett,
I'm going to ask you too.

25:14.079 --> 25:17.089
Do you think it is fair
that Jose said

25:17.109 --> 25:20.059
that you were misleading him
at your mom's house?

25:20.079 --> 25:24.180
- Yeah, we reconnected,
but I had already communicated

25:24.200 --> 25:26.009
with him
that I didn't see

25:26.029 --> 25:28.019
a relationship
forming beyond that.

25:28.039 --> 25:29.200
[somber music]

25:29.220 --> 25:32.069
- I don't know.

- [sighs]

25:38.029 --> 25:41.059
No. No.

25:41.079 --> 25:43.220
Sorry.
It's really hard sometimes

25:44.009 --> 25:46.210
when you do have
a connection with someone,

25:46.230 --> 25:49.119
but then you know
there's characteristics

25:49.140 --> 25:52.059
in the relationship that aren't
going to work out long-term.

25:52.079 --> 25:54.170
And I think
that's where we are, Jose.

25:54.190 --> 25:57.230
But again, apologies for,

25:58.009 --> 26:00.089
you know,
levels of miscommunication

26:00.109 --> 26:02.220
that I think
we both experienced.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.089
- I accept that. I mean,
I thank you for apologizing.

26:06.109 --> 26:07.230
That makes me feel
a little bit better,

26:08.009 --> 26:10.069
because I don't think
you've ever apologized.

26:10.089 --> 26:12.019
- I have a question for you,
Garrett.

26:12.039 --> 26:15.140
You have one, two, three, four,
five men sitting here,

26:15.160 --> 26:19.029
telling you how you made us
feel, and your response is,

that's"--like,

the accountability?

26:25.180 --> 26:28.119
I want to be a nice person,

and clearly I failed at it.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.049
Clearly I hurt people
along the way.

26:45.069 --> 26:46.180
You know what?

26:46.200 --> 26:49.059
You're not always going
to make the right decision.

26:49.079 --> 26:51.200
- You need to understand
how your words and actions

26:51.220 --> 26:53.190
feel to other people,
take accountability,

26:53.210 --> 26:56.039
and maybe grow.
- Okay, all right.

26:56.059 --> 27:00.130
So love is intense.
And I think that, Garrett,

27:00.150 --> 27:04.190
the fact that you invited
everyone home for the holidays,

27:04.210 --> 27:06.059
that was a really
powerful moment.

27:06.079 --> 27:08.039
You know, as a person,
you know,

27:08.059 --> 27:10.230
fabulously
of the LGBTQIA+ community,

27:11.009 --> 27:13.130
I thought it really represented
something beautiful for us,

27:13.150 --> 27:16.000
because a lot of times,
you don't see

27:16.019 --> 27:19.170
positive representation
of gays and family life.

27:19.190 --> 27:23.049
What did it feel like
seeing your mom embrace

27:23.069 --> 27:24.230
all of your newfound--well,

27:25.009 --> 27:27.130
I almost said lovers--
and friends?

27:27.150 --> 27:29.039
- It was really special.

27:29.059 --> 27:34.009
Personally, I started
my own journey coming out,

27:34.029 --> 27:37.049
I was scared like everyone else
is probably scared

27:37.069 --> 27:39.099
when they tell their family
that they're gay.

27:39.119 --> 27:41.210
And, you know,
your family has one way, maybe,

27:41.230 --> 27:44.210
of thinking your life's
going to go this way.

27:44.230 --> 27:47.049
And then you change
the direction for them

27:47.069 --> 27:52.099
by coming out,
and I was so proud of my mom

27:52.119 --> 27:54.069
and proud of these men

27:54.089 --> 27:57.000
for letting
that opportunity happen,

27:57.019 --> 27:59.200
because that was really special
to me personally.

27:59.220 --> 28:01.130
- I still have these butterfly

28:01.150 --> 28:03.049
happy feelings
from that moment.

28:03.069 --> 28:05.150
- Watching your journey
for love

28:05.170 --> 28:07.109
was something
that was inspiring to me.

28:07.130 --> 28:09.079
Even though in the end
you didn't get

28:09.099 --> 28:12.029
to take one person
who had captured your heart,

28:12.049 --> 28:13.150
you took everybody.

28:13.170 --> 28:14.230
You should be very proud, okay?

28:15.009 --> 28:16.069
- Thank you.
- All right, halleloo.

28:16.089 --> 28:17.220
I love you.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.019
All right, well,
I guess we better go ahead

28:20.039 --> 28:23.140
and get the down low
from our very final lead,

28:23.160 --> 28:25.220
our lovely Chad.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.029
Come on up, Chad!

28:27.049 --> 28:28.220
[cheers and applause]

28:29.000 --> 28:31.049
- Yes!

28:31.069 --> 28:32.130
[cheers and applause]

28:32.150 --> 28:34.109
- Ohh.

28:34.130 --> 28:35.160
How you doing, Shangela?

28:35.180 --> 28:37.230
- Oh. My Chad.
- How you doing?

28:38.009 --> 28:40.059
- Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad!

28:40.079 --> 28:42.009
I want to come over
and sit on the couch with you,

28:42.029 --> 28:43.150
but no,
I got to be socially distanced.

28:43.170 --> 28:46.190
Okay, I got to be distancing.
Don't you tempt me, Chad!

28:46.210 --> 28:48.190
[laughter]

28:48.210 --> 28:51.009
Now, Chad, baby,
you came into this show

28:51.029 --> 28:52.150
like a wrecking ball with lips.

28:52.170 --> 28:55.049
I mean, just kissing any
and everybody came in your way.

28:55.069 --> 28:57.180
Like mwah bam,
mwah bam, mwah bam!

28:57.200 --> 29:00.009
I was like,
come on, Miley Cyrus!

29:00.029 --> 29:02.180
[laughter and applause]

29:02.200 --> 29:05.079
Honey, you were busier
than Santa Claus

29:05.099 --> 29:07.220
on Christmas Eve, okay?

29:08.000 --> 29:09.190
And trust me, you can come
down my chimney anytime.

29:09.210 --> 29:13.059
Ooh, thank you! Oh, well
that's kind of--excuse me.

29:13.079 --> 29:15.069
[laughter]
Sorry, Granny.

29:15.089 --> 29:18.009
Chad, what are your secrets
to a good kiss?

29:18.029 --> 29:19.079
- Well, I mean, you definitely

29:19.099 --> 29:20.220
want to make sure
it's mutual first.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.160
But yeah, I think
just closing your eyes...

29:25.180 --> 29:26.200
- Mm-hmm.

29:26.220 --> 29:28.069
- Throwing those lips
out there,

29:28.089 --> 29:29.109
and just hoping
for the best, really.

29:29.130 --> 29:31.150
[laughter]

29:31.170 --> 29:35.160
- Now, Chad, your love story
became one of the best ones

29:35.180 --> 29:37.109
to watch blossom on screen.

29:37.130 --> 29:40.170
Let's go back and take a look
at how it went.

29:40.190 --> 29:42.000
- Merry Christmas, everyone!

29:42.019 --> 29:43.109
- Who are we? Who are we?
Who are we?

29:43.130 --> 29:47.039
- Hi! I'm Kate,
and I'm your new date.

29:47.059 --> 29:49.099
- You are beautiful, I'm sorry.

29:49.119 --> 29:51.140
- I think I'm blushing now.
- Kate's extremely attractive.

29:51.160 --> 29:54.039
I was drawn to her smile,
her eyes,

29:54.059 --> 29:55.220
and just her
bubbly personality.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.180
- [rapping] Loving cute cats
is worth all my time

29:57.200 --> 30:00.160
When they look like Garfield
and purr all the time

30:00.180 --> 30:02.190
When I'm with Chad,
things just click.

30:02.210 --> 30:04.059
It feels easy.

30:04.079 --> 30:07.099
- I'm glad that you're here
and that we can just relax

30:07.119 --> 30:10.099
and talk about,
you know, nothingness.

30:10.119 --> 30:12.160
- Oh, I can do that.

30:12.180 --> 30:14.049
- I know you can!

30:14.069 --> 30:15.210
What I see within Kate
is completely different

30:15.230 --> 30:18.119
than any other relationship
in the castle,

30:18.140 --> 30:20.019
let alone
any other relationship

30:20.039 --> 30:21.180
that I've ever experienced.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.130
- I never knew, honestly,
what love could be like

30:24.150 --> 30:28.089
with somebody
until I met Chad.

30:28.109 --> 30:29.220
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

30:30.000 --> 30:31.089
- Based off my
parents' relationship,

30:31.109 --> 30:34.039
I really believe in true love.

30:35.089 --> 30:37.059
I love you so much.

30:37.079 --> 30:41.109
Kate...

30:41.130 --> 30:44.180
will you marry me?

30:46.190 --> 30:48.160
- Absolutely, yes.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.079
[laughs]

30:51.099 --> 30:53.009
Yes. Oh, my God.

30:53.029 --> 30:55.099
[cheers and applause]

30:55.119 --> 30:58.160
Oh, my God.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.190
Wow.

31:00.210 --> 31:02.150
Oh, my God!

31:02.170 --> 31:04.200
[laughs]

31:04.220 --> 31:06.079
[cheers and applause]

31:06.099 --> 31:08.220
- All right! All right!

31:09.000 --> 31:12.119
- I actually don't really get
emotional very often, but--

31:12.140 --> 31:15.029
- Why are you
getting emotional?

31:15.049 --> 31:17.180
- Um...the ending there.

31:17.200 --> 31:21.019
I took that plunge,
and I took it with Kate,

31:21.039 --> 31:24.119
and it's just--
I'm just really happy.

31:24.140 --> 31:26.210
- Let's bring Kate out
right now.

31:26.230 --> 31:30.130
Everyone's favorite
cat-rapping lady!

31:30.150 --> 31:32.000
Kate!

31:32.019 --> 31:33.230
[cheers and applause]

31:34.009 --> 31:36.019
- Hey!
- Hi!

31:36.039 --> 31:37.039
- Hi!

31:37.059 --> 31:39.190
Hi, guys!
- Yes, have a seat!

31:39.210 --> 31:41.200
Are you two still engaged?

31:41.220 --> 31:43.140
What is the current update?

31:43.160 --> 31:47.170
- Do you have it on?
- It's all coming together.

31:47.190 --> 31:49.119
[applause]
- Yes!

31:49.140 --> 31:52.220
- Oh! Oh, yeah! Ah!

31:53.000 --> 31:55.140
That's the finger under
the chin; I know that move!

31:55.160 --> 31:58.130
I saw--okay, all right, hey!
Get a room!

31:58.150 --> 32:01.130
It's exciting to hear
that you're still engaged.

32:01.150 --> 32:03.039
And what else--is anything else

32:03.059 --> 32:05.039
new happening in your lives
right now?

32:05.059 --> 32:08.119
- We just signed a lease,
and Chad's coming to Chi-Town!

32:08.140 --> 32:10.119
[cheers and applause]
- Oh.

32:10.140 --> 32:12.039
All right!

32:12.059 --> 32:14.009
- I'm super excited!
- It looks like 2020

32:14.029 --> 32:16.220
didn't stop everybody,
all right?

32:17.190 --> 32:19.220
- Wait, so you can move
across the country for someone?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.119
That's crazy.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.059
- So, Chad,
let's talk about your journey.

32:23.079 --> 32:28.079
Was it hard to date so many
fantastic women at one time?

32:28.099 --> 32:29.230
- The hardest thing
I've ever done.

32:30.009 --> 32:31.099
- You know, you ruffled a
couple feathers along the way.

32:31.119 --> 32:34.099
Do you ever feel
that you were misunderstood

32:34.119 --> 32:36.000
by any of the women
that you dated?

32:36.019 --> 32:38.000
- Yeah, for instance,
with Angel.

32:38.019 --> 32:39.200
I'll be honest,
I'm a perfectionist,

32:39.220 --> 32:43.019
and I also really do try to be
as kind as possible,

32:43.039 --> 32:46.130
but I know now
that wasn't always the case.

32:46.150 --> 32:48.130
For some rea--
we just didn't see--

32:48.150 --> 32:50.109
couldn't get on the same page.

32:50.130 --> 32:53.099
There were some
misunderstandings as far as,

32:53.119 --> 32:57.170
you know, my feelings towards
getting to know you more.

32:57.190 --> 32:59.170
But I do, honestly,
from the bottom of my heart,

32:59.190 --> 33:02.130
want to apologize with the way
we ended things,

33:02.150 --> 33:06.049
because you really do shine.

33:06.069 --> 33:10.049
And I almost feel like
I robbed you a little bit,

33:10.069 --> 33:12.000
in a sense, of your shine,

33:12.019 --> 33:16.170
and your ability
to just be more present

33:16.190 --> 33:19.049
and just be there longer
in the experience,

33:19.069 --> 33:20.160
because you're
an amazing person,

33:20.180 --> 33:22.150
and that's on me,
and I really apologize.

33:22.170 --> 33:24.119
- I was a little bit surprised,
because I thought

33:24.140 --> 33:26.140
that I had a chance
to potentially,

33:26.160 --> 33:29.059
you know, stay or maybe see if
there might've been something,

33:29.079 --> 33:31.019
but I also knew
that Chad and I,

33:31.039 --> 33:33.069
even off camera,
we weren't really, like,

33:33.089 --> 33:34.220
exploring each other.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.019
After I didn't get chosen
for a date, stubborn Taurus,

33:37.039 --> 33:40.039
I was like, "That's it,
he's got other options,"

33:40.059 --> 33:41.220
you know?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.079
And even though we didn't
get a chance to explore,

33:44.099 --> 33:47.039
I think it's fine for you
to pick someone

33:47.059 --> 33:50.099
that you actually do feel
more of a connection with,

33:50.119 --> 33:52.119
even though I'm sure
the viewers were disappointed,

33:52.140 --> 33:54.119
because everybody
wants to see, like,

33:54.140 --> 33:56.180
the Black girl have
a happy ending, right?

33:56.200 --> 34:00.099
But we did actually end
that night on a good note.

34:00.119 --> 34:01.160
- We did.

34:01.180 --> 34:03.069
- Now, Chad is
a one-in-a-million,

34:03.089 --> 34:05.089
and he can get away with a lot
of things by, you know,

34:05.109 --> 34:08.150
just doing what I call
one of those Chad-isms. Mm-hmm.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.059
- I like that.
- Yeah.

34:10.079 --> 34:13.159
Well, let's take a look at Chad
giving us some Chad-isms.

34:13.179 --> 34:14.219
- I am a flirt.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.170
You meet someone new,
and I go all in.

34:16.190 --> 34:19.039
You look amazing.
You look amazing.

34:19.059 --> 34:20.179
You have the sweetest smile.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.090
You have one of the best smiles
I've ever seen.

34:22.110 --> 34:25.030
Always looking cute.
Looking cute as always.

34:25.050 --> 34:28.059
You're lovely! Did I mention
your dress? It's lovely.

34:28.079 --> 34:30.019
I try not to be cheesy,

34:30.039 --> 34:31.199
but I just feel like
it's in my nature.

34:31.219 --> 34:34.190
Out here looking like
a pastel snow queen.

34:34.210 --> 34:37.119
Your sweetness is my weakness.

34:37.139 --> 34:40.199
Angel is dressed
like an angel, and I love it.

34:40.219 --> 34:41.199
The scenery is finally

34:41.219 --> 34:42.219
matching your eyes.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.010
- Oh, stop.

34:44.030 --> 34:46.210
- Your eyes
are just incredible.

34:46.230 --> 34:48.030
How tall are you?
- 5'2".

34:48.050 --> 34:50.010
I'll put you
in my pocket right here!

34:50.030 --> 34:51.190
I'm really interested
in Shannon.

34:51.210 --> 34:53.159
She's gorgeous.
You look lovely.

34:53.179 --> 34:55.210
I'm digging
the emotional connection

34:55.230 --> 34:58.010
between Skyler and I.

34:58.030 --> 34:59.119
Alexia is my strongest
connection.

34:59.139 --> 35:02.019
This isn't warming me up,
maybe you can?

35:02.039 --> 35:04.119
I'm so back and forth;
I'm constantly conflicted.

35:04.139 --> 35:07.110
Okay if I gave you a kiss?
Can I give you a kiss?

35:07.130 --> 35:08.230
May I kiss you?

35:09.010 --> 35:11.059
Would you mind coming over here
for one more?

35:11.079 --> 35:13.170
- Yes.
- I have absolutely no clue

35:13.190 --> 35:16.030
what's happening.
Can I give you a hug?

35:16.050 --> 35:18.050
- No.
- Okay.

35:18.070 --> 35:21.079
[laughter]

35:21.099 --> 35:23.199
- And, Kate,
I can see on your face.

35:23.219 --> 35:26.199
How aware were you
about all of Chad's,

35:26.219 --> 35:31.179
you know--how do I say this.
extra-kiss-ricular activities?

35:31.199 --> 35:35.119
- Well, I didn't know, like,
how many people he kissed.

35:35.139 --> 35:38.050
And I think it's actually,
like, probably for,

35:38.070 --> 35:40.150
like, the best that I didn't
know, to be honest.

35:40.170 --> 35:43.019
- The question is,
has Chad seen

35:43.039 --> 35:45.190
all of your
extra-kiss-ricular

35:45.210 --> 35:47.159
activities in the castle?
- Ooh!

35:47.179 --> 35:50.050
- What?

35:50.070 --> 35:51.230
- No way!
- Well, you know,

35:52.010 --> 35:54.130
those cameras in the castle
are always rolling, right?

35:54.150 --> 35:56.039
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

35:56.059 --> 35:58.010
Let's just roll the tape.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.210
[laughter]

35:59.230 --> 36:01.099
[romantic music]

36:01.119 --> 36:03.090
- What was your first
impression of me, I gotta ask?

36:03.110 --> 36:05.010
- Okay...
- Tyson!

36:05.030 --> 36:07.079
- You are handsome as hell.

36:07.099 --> 36:08.170
- Thank you.
- Seriously!

36:08.190 --> 36:10.079
I honestly was like,
"Who is this guy?"

36:10.099 --> 36:13.090
- Oh, wow. You came in, like,
on fire, like...

36:13.110 --> 36:15.019
- Aw, thank you.
- You are, like,

36:15.039 --> 36:17.099
amazingly attractive, and--
- I think I'm getting like,

36:17.119 --> 36:20.179
nervous like a--like
a schoolgirl right now.

36:20.199 --> 36:22.019
- Do you kiss the first date?

36:22.039 --> 36:24.110
- Um...

36:24.130 --> 36:25.210
- Tyson!

36:25.230 --> 36:29.079
- I do kiss on the first date,
if I feel comfortable.

36:29.099 --> 36:32.099
- Are you feeling
comfortable today?

36:32.119 --> 36:35.019
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:35.039 --> 36:37.170
[cheers and laughter]

36:37.190 --> 36:39.199
- Get in there!

36:39.219 --> 36:41.179
- Well, there's your answer.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.070
- I'm glad, you know,
we got that out of the way.

36:43.090 --> 36:44.119
Now we can move
forward from there.

36:44.139 --> 36:46.179
- Exactly!

36:46.199 --> 36:51.070
- Well, well, well, well,
well, well, well, well, well!

36:51.090 --> 36:54.050
- That was not my best work.
[laughter]

36:54.070 --> 36:56.030
- We tell
each other everything.

36:56.050 --> 36:58.230
I knew about that;
it was even better to watch.

36:59.010 --> 37:00.070
But...
- Was it?

37:00.090 --> 37:02.130
I feel a threesome
coming on tonight!

37:02.150 --> 37:05.070
[all hollering]

37:05.090 --> 37:07.110
"Better to watch"?
What kind of...

37:07.130 --> 37:08.090
[laughter]

37:08.110 --> 37:09.230
We saw a lot of connections,

37:10.010 --> 37:13.119
although there was not
as strong a connection, Chad,

37:13.139 --> 37:15.150
for you and Miss Chelsea.

37:15.170 --> 37:17.159
- What's up, girl?
- I really loved

37:17.179 --> 37:19.000
watching you come on the show,

37:19.019 --> 37:21.050
because you came
in hot like fire.

37:21.070 --> 37:24.130
Like spicy habanero sauce,
okay?

37:24.150 --> 37:26.039
There were some
very interesting moments

37:26.059 --> 37:27.110
in your journey.

37:27.130 --> 37:29.000
- Like what?
- Shall we take a look?

37:29.019 --> 37:30.230
- Yeah.
- All right.

37:31.010 --> 37:32.070
- Let's go.
- Love her.

37:32.090 --> 37:34.000
- When was your
last relationship?

37:34.019 --> 37:37.059
- I'll have a thing with like
five people at the same time.

37:37.079 --> 37:38.199
- Don't take this
the wrong way,

37:38.219 --> 37:42.030
but I just don't get
the greatest feeling from you.

37:42.050 --> 37:44.119
- You just didn't give me
a chance at all.

37:44.139 --> 37:47.110
- I don't think that you really
did want to get to know me.

37:47.130 --> 37:50.119
- The fuck is wrong
with that guy?

37:53.000 --> 37:55.199
- I love it.
- Okay! Well.

37:55.219 --> 37:58.119
- You can smell the dra-ma!

37:58.139 --> 37:59.199
[laughter]

37:59.219 --> 38:04.000
It is hot in here, baby!

38:04.019 --> 38:05.119
- In watching that back, Chad,

38:05.139 --> 38:08.039
is there anything
that you would have done

38:08.059 --> 38:11.150
differently to try
and create a connection?

38:11.170 --> 38:13.000
- I'm gonna be honest.

38:13.019 --> 38:14.219
Chelsea scared
the hell out of me.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.170
[laughter]
She--she did.

38:16.190 --> 38:17.210
- Maybe I was being
a little catty,

38:17.230 --> 38:19.090
because I was a little, like,

38:19.110 --> 38:21.010
annoyed that he didn't want
to be with me.

38:21.030 --> 38:22.210
But at the end of the day,
like, he wouldn't have

38:22.230 --> 38:25.059
picked me to marry him
no matter what, so it's, like,

38:25.079 --> 38:27.139
I'm glad that he didn't waste
his time with someone like me.

38:27.159 --> 38:29.170
Like, I think us as friends,
like,

38:29.190 --> 38:31.110
I think we could be homies,
we could be cool.

38:31.130 --> 38:33.090
Like, we've made
each other laugh, like,

38:33.110 --> 38:34.199
I mean--well,
you haven't made me laugh,

38:34.219 --> 38:37.210
but like, I make you laugh.
[laughter]

38:37.230 --> 38:39.010
- Wow!

38:39.030 --> 38:40.090
- Well, listen saucy Santa,

38:40.110 --> 38:42.190
you're known to be
a dating diva.

38:42.210 --> 38:44.230
And I live, okay?
Halleloo, I live.

38:45.010 --> 38:50.030
Tell me, is it difficult dating
more than one person at a time?

38:50.050 --> 38:51.090
- No.

38:51.110 --> 38:53.030
- Ooh.
- It can be difficult

38:53.050 --> 38:55.139
if you're, like, trying to
remember different things

38:55.159 --> 38:57.130
about different people and
you're like, "I forgot, like,

38:57.150 --> 38:59.139
if that guy, like, his mom
died or someone else's,

38:59.159 --> 39:01.059
like, I forgot,"
like, it's a little sensitive.

39:01.079 --> 39:04.059
I think most men date
multiple girls at one time,

39:04.079 --> 39:06.050
and they just don't
tell us about it.

39:06.070 --> 39:08.039
So I decided to take
the power away,

39:08.059 --> 39:09.090
and I'm going to date
multiple guys at one time

39:09.110 --> 39:11.019
and then tell them about it.

39:11.039 --> 39:13.039
- All right, come on for the
snatching my power girl, yes!

39:13.059 --> 39:14.190
Okay!
- It works!

39:14.210 --> 39:16.139
I think everybody
should do that

39:16.159 --> 39:18.099
when they're, like, dating.
I mean, everyone except Chad.

39:18.119 --> 39:19.150
I don't think
he wants to do that.

39:19.170 --> 39:23.039
[laughter]

39:23.059 --> 39:25.030
- Well, you know, in the
beginning of your journey,

39:25.050 --> 39:27.139
you made a connection
with Faith, right?

39:27.159 --> 39:30.079
And, Faith, I can--ooh, I
can feel from the screen, baby,

39:30.099 --> 39:31.210
the technology, the radiation
is letting me know

39:31.230 --> 39:33.090
you have something
you want to say.

39:33.110 --> 39:38.039
- At the time when I chose
to kiss Chad,

39:38.059 --> 39:40.110
I feel like I handled it
really poorly.

39:40.130 --> 39:42.139
Looking back now,
it's a learning experience.

39:42.159 --> 39:46.119
If I could go back and handle
it differently, I would.

39:46.139 --> 39:48.030
Kate, I'm so sorry; we don't
have to talk about this,

39:48.050 --> 39:50.099
because you're my girl,
I love you!

39:50.119 --> 39:51.179
[laughs]

39:51.199 --> 39:54.190
So awkward.
But yeah, so, Chad, again,

39:54.210 --> 39:57.110
I'm sorry that everything
happened the way did,

39:57.130 --> 39:59.170
and, Alexia,
that you got roped into it,

39:59.190 --> 40:02.070
and obviously, Anthony, that
I handled it the way I did.

40:02.090 --> 40:04.019
- Well, thank you for that,
Faith,

40:04.039 --> 40:07.039
but at the end of the day,
it all worked out for you, yes?

40:07.059 --> 40:09.070
- It did.
- All right. Alexia.

40:09.090 --> 40:10.179
- Yes.
- You also had

40:10.199 --> 40:12.110
a romantic journey with Chad.

40:12.130 --> 40:14.190
You know, you and Kate
were pretty neck-and-neck.

40:14.210 --> 40:17.099
How do you feel today?

40:17.119 --> 40:19.110
- I was excited
when I was with Chad.

40:19.130 --> 40:20.230
But at the end of the day,

40:21.010 --> 40:23.039
I'm just happy
that he stuck with his heart,

40:23.059 --> 40:26.010
and he's with Kate.
I love Kate, she's my girl!

40:26.030 --> 40:27.199
- I know! My girl.
- I know, you seem like

40:27.219 --> 40:30.030
you would be
a bridesmaid at the wedding...

40:30.050 --> 40:31.170
- Hope so!
- After this--that could be

40:31.190 --> 40:33.039
something interesting.

40:33.059 --> 40:37.130
Shannon, you also came in
ready to find love.

40:37.150 --> 40:39.000
Do you feel like the connection

40:39.019 --> 40:41.110
that you had with Chad
was a genuine one?

40:41.130 --> 40:43.179
- Honestly, definitely.

40:43.199 --> 40:46.050
- You even came back again...
- Absolutely.

40:46.070 --> 40:47.119
- Like, you know what?
I'm not done.

40:47.139 --> 40:49.130
- Yeah.
- What brought you back?

40:49.150 --> 40:51.190
- I do not want any regrets
in life,

40:51.210 --> 40:55.000
and I just felt as though

40:55.019 --> 40:57.130
you and I had something,

40:57.150 --> 41:00.219
and I did not want to wonder,
"What if?" So...

41:01.010 --> 41:02.130
- Do you feel like
the other girls who were there

41:02.150 --> 41:05.000
gave you a fair shot
in the initial meeting?

41:05.019 --> 41:07.190
- No. No, I don't.

41:07.210 --> 41:11.230
People initially thought
I was a little fake,

41:12.010 --> 41:13.130
calling me a little Kardashian,

41:13.150 --> 41:16.039
which, to be honest,
I am a little flattered.

41:16.059 --> 41:20.019
I love the Kardashians,
so yeah.

41:20.039 --> 41:22.199
You know, you can't really
judge a book by its cover.

41:22.219 --> 41:26.219
Alexia and I,
we were friends in the castle,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.179
but when I heard the things
that she was saying about me,

41:29.199 --> 41:32.130
like, I was like,
"Excuse me? That's rude!"

41:32.150 --> 41:34.130
- Oh!
- Well, Shannon, you know,

41:34.150 --> 41:38.019
I apologize for the things
that I said.

41:38.039 --> 41:40.019
And it wasn't me,

41:40.039 --> 41:42.110
and it was definitely
out of character for me.

41:42.130 --> 41:45.179
I think I was just emotionally
drained at that point

41:45.199 --> 41:47.050
and a little stressed as well.

41:47.070 --> 41:49.179
I mean, you are beautiful
like a Kardashian.

41:49.199 --> 41:51.059
I mean, seriously!
[laughs]

41:51.079 --> 41:53.179
But I just want you to know
that I am sorry.

41:53.199 --> 41:55.059
- Thank you.

41:55.079 --> 41:57.219
- Well, you know,
in competitions...

41:58.000 --> 41:59.219
- Yeah.
- Things can always be said

42:00.000 --> 42:01.099
when you're competitors.

42:01.119 --> 42:03.230
But it's nice to see that you
ladies are together tonight,

42:04.010 --> 42:06.059
which is very beautiful.

42:06.079 --> 42:08.230
Skyler,
how strong was the connection

42:09.010 --> 42:10.119
that you and Chad had together?

42:10.139 --> 42:12.219
- Initially we had a really
strong connection,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.210
and we were the only two there,
so I was, like,

42:15.230 --> 42:17.099
happy that there was
no competition.

42:17.119 --> 42:20.119
And then I definitely
got jealous of Angel

42:20.139 --> 42:22.119
because she's so hot.
[laughter]

42:22.139 --> 42:24.090
And then I, like,
was, like, ugh, over it,

42:24.110 --> 42:27.070
and then Kevin, of course...
y'all know what happened

42:27.090 --> 42:30.090
with Kevin.
- How are you and Kevin?

42:30.110 --> 42:32.099
- Kevin and I are great.
We live on opposite sides

42:32.119 --> 42:35.110
of the country, and we still,
like, talk all the time,

42:35.130 --> 42:37.000
like, just texting, but--

42:37.019 --> 42:38.099
- Yeah, 'cause maybe you can
clarify

42:38.119 --> 42:40.019
this on the timeline for me.
- Okay.

42:40.039 --> 42:42.179
- I'm watching it,
and I saw Faith was like,

42:42.199 --> 42:44.050
"You know what?
I'm into Anthony.

42:44.070 --> 42:45.210
Skyler is my girl"--
- I was like,

42:45.230 --> 42:47.210
"Take him off my hands!"
- "So I'm going to save Kevin."

42:47.230 --> 42:49.039
She was like, girl code.

42:49.059 --> 42:50.190
And she saved Kevin
to stay there,

42:50.210 --> 42:52.150
not for herself, but for you.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.219
- Yeah, yeah.
- But, you told Chad,

42:55.000 --> 42:56.070
"I am back into you."

42:56.090 --> 42:58.230
Were you playing him,
or were you really into him?

42:59.010 --> 43:02.099
- She's calling you out.
- To be honest,

43:02.119 --> 43:05.190
I was playing him.
- Whoo!

43:05.210 --> 43:07.199
- Hey, she kept it real.
[cheers and laughter]

43:07.219 --> 43:10.179
- I was trying to cheat
the system a little bit.

43:10.199 --> 43:13.119
'Cause yeah, at that point
I was, like, fully into Kevin.

43:13.139 --> 43:15.099
And then I was like,
"Uh-oh, like, obviously

43:15.119 --> 43:18.179
he's not going to keep me here,
because I'm not here for him,"

43:18.199 --> 43:20.110
and I'm really sorry
that I did that to you.

43:20.130 --> 43:22.190
- Oh, it's okay.
- But I would do it again.

43:22.210 --> 43:25.019
[laughter]
- Oh, yes.

43:25.039 --> 43:27.170
Well, you know what?
Here's a good question, then.

43:27.190 --> 43:30.139
So, Kevin, there was a night

43:30.159 --> 43:32.150
when everyone was together,
right?

43:32.170 --> 43:35.130
And you were having the beer
and the pizza, okay?

43:35.150 --> 43:37.039
- Okay.
- And she kept trying to

43:37.059 --> 43:39.050
get you
to go back to the bedroom.

43:39.070 --> 43:41.119
- Kevin, are you done
with your pizza?

43:41.139 --> 43:44.210
- Yeah, I'm done with my pizza,
but I'm not done with my beer.

43:44.230 --> 43:47.070
Can I just talk to my friends?

43:49.099 --> 43:51.150
And she's getting sad, and--

43:53.030 --> 43:54.210
- Please clarify for the doll.

43:54.230 --> 43:56.130
[chatter]

43:56.150 --> 43:58.230
- Well, the bedroom is where
we shared our first--

43:59.010 --> 44:01.010
- Oh, I know what happens
in the bedroom, girl!

44:01.030 --> 44:03.150
You don't have to tell me!
I know, don't y'all know?

44:03.170 --> 44:05.139
- Okay, so you know
what happens in the bedroom,

44:05.159 --> 44:08.090
so that's why I was trying
to go back to the bedroom!

44:08.110 --> 44:11.110
And he just
didn't want to go, so...

44:11.130 --> 44:12.179
- But why didn't Kevin
want to go?

44:12.199 --> 44:14.059
- What did you want
to do that night?

44:14.079 --> 44:15.179
- I wanted to hang out
with the boys...

44:15.199 --> 44:19.039
And then after, go,
and that's quite simple!

44:19.059 --> 44:20.170
- That's what he kept saying.

44:20.190 --> 44:23.019
- I understand wanting to hang
with the boys, yes.

44:23.039 --> 44:24.130
Ooh and after this,

44:24.150 --> 44:26.010
I would like to see
every single one of you

44:26.030 --> 44:27.159
in my dressing room
right now, trust me.

44:27.179 --> 44:30.130
I'm wearing smudge-proof
lipstick, mm-hmm.

44:30.150 --> 44:32.019
[laughter]

44:32.039 --> 44:34.199
And don't worry, Kevin,
I've got a beer and a pizza

44:34.219 --> 44:36.179
and the boys.

44:36.199 --> 44:38.099
[laughter]

44:38.119 --> 44:39.179
- Oh, my God.

44:39.199 --> 44:41.050
Oh, my God.

44:41.070 --> 44:43.159
- Skyler, is there a future
for you and Kevin?

44:43.179 --> 44:47.210
- Um...maybe there would be
if we lived closer,

44:47.230 --> 44:51.219
but we don't, and I definitely
don't think I would, like,

44:52.000 --> 44:55.159
move across the country for...

44:55.179 --> 44:56.219
- For Kevin.
- For Kevin.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.070
[laughter]

44:58.090 --> 45:00.099
- Yes, well, there's nothing
wrong with having

45:00.119 --> 45:02.210
the connection
when you have the connection.

45:02.230 --> 45:04.179
- Yes.
- Okay? Halleloo.

45:04.199 --> 45:06.090
And I wish you both
all the best.

45:06.110 --> 45:08.099
- Thanks.
- And a late checkout.

45:08.119 --> 45:10.139
[laughter]

45:10.159 --> 45:13.199
- Oh, goodness.
- You know, Chad,

45:13.219 --> 45:15.119
you had a lot of choices.

45:15.139 --> 45:20.139
In the end, it came down to
Kate and Shannon and Alexia.

45:20.159 --> 45:24.190
And you just kept coming back
to Kate here. Why?

45:24.210 --> 45:28.099
- Kate really, really just
genuinely cracks me up.

45:28.119 --> 45:30.170
She's just--she's funny,
she's witty.

45:30.190 --> 45:33.219
Like, we just connected
so quickly.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.219
It really--I know
this sounds cheesy,

45:36.000 --> 45:37.059
but I've said cheesier things.

45:37.079 --> 45:39.110
She just felt like home
from the beginning.

45:39.130 --> 45:41.199
- What was the moment
that you knew,

45:41.219 --> 45:43.210
"This is the one for me"?

45:43.230 --> 45:47.110
- After that really tough...

45:47.130 --> 45:51.059
ceremony,
where Chelsea left,

45:51.079 --> 45:54.019
I was really emotionally
exhausted,

45:54.039 --> 45:55.130
physically exhausted,

45:55.150 --> 45:59.039
and I remember being up
in the bedroom,

45:59.059 --> 46:01.110
and all of a sudden,
I just hear your voice,

46:01.130 --> 46:02.230
and I just see your smile.

46:03.010 --> 46:06.139
And I could tell that you were
going above and beyond,

46:06.159 --> 46:08.039
and I could feel that.

46:08.059 --> 46:10.230
And that's--
that's when I knew, so....

46:11.010 --> 46:14.019
- [whimpers]
- It was our first date

46:14.039 --> 46:15.159
in the library when I sat down,

46:15.179 --> 46:17.119
and it was just you
and I in that moment.

46:17.139 --> 46:19.039
I forgot, like,
completely where I was,

46:19.059 --> 46:21.079
and I've never, like,
experienced that in my life.

46:21.099 --> 46:23.039
And from that moment
I just, like,

46:23.059 --> 46:24.199
didn't want you to, like,
leave my side.

46:24.219 --> 46:27.219
You let me be 100% myself.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.219
You're the kindest,
most genuine, caring person,

46:30.000 --> 46:34.039
and you've absolutely changed
my life for the better.

46:34.059 --> 46:37.099
- You're radiant, your energy,
it can't be matched.

46:37.119 --> 46:41.179
And I felt that
from the second I met you.

46:41.199 --> 46:45.030
And to be honest,
I just wanted

46:45.050 --> 46:48.050
to hitch myself to your side.

46:48.070 --> 46:51.170
- Aw! Well, I don't hear
jingle bells ringing right now,

46:51.190 --> 46:53.050
but I definitely hear
wedding bells.

46:53.070 --> 46:54.150
- Whoo!

46:54.170 --> 46:57.090
- I am ordained!
I am ordained!

46:57.110 --> 47:00.210
- Of course somebody would be
ordained here, of course!

47:00.230 --> 47:02.130
Of course.
[laughter]

47:02.150 --> 47:04.190
We're moving in together;
we just want to have--like,

47:04.210 --> 47:07.039
this is the time where
you can just, like, have fun.

47:07.059 --> 47:08.159
- I'm nervous
moving to Chicago.

47:08.179 --> 47:10.190
I don't, obviously,
really have any friends there,

47:10.210 --> 47:14.219
but Kate's friends are already
welcoming me with open arms,

47:15.000 --> 47:16.110
and I'm really excited
about it.

47:16.130 --> 47:18.010
- Well, I'm going to tell you.
When you're meeting

47:18.030 --> 47:20.119
new friends,
don't start out with,

47:20.139 --> 47:22.030
"Hi, may I kiss you?"

47:22.050 --> 47:24.159
Okay?
If you don't do that,

47:24.179 --> 47:27.079
I think you'll make lots
of friends in Chicago, baby.

47:27.099 --> 47:29.050
All right?

47:29.070 --> 47:32.019
I loved watching
your journey on this show,

47:32.039 --> 47:34.010
and seeing you have
this moment together.

47:34.030 --> 47:37.099
I loved watching all of you
create connections

47:37.119 --> 47:39.019
and have fun dating moments.

47:39.039 --> 47:43.019
You know, for our leads, Faith,
and for Garrett, yeah,

47:43.039 --> 47:44.179
you're not being engaged
right now.

47:44.199 --> 47:48.000
However, there is still love
out in the world for you,

47:48.019 --> 47:49.190
and all of us
and all of your fans

47:49.210 --> 47:52.170
who have watched the show are
rooting for you in that place.

47:52.190 --> 47:55.030
Okay?
All of you,

47:55.050 --> 47:58.090
thank you so much for sharing
your journey of love.

47:58.110 --> 48:00.070
I wish you all the best.
And with that,

48:00.090 --> 48:04.139
that is a wrap on the "12 Dates
of Christmas Unwrapped."

48:04.159 --> 48:06.070
[cheers and applause]

48:06.090 --> 48:07.230
Happy holidays, everyone!

48:08.010 --> 48:09.119
Merry Christmas!

48:09.139 --> 48:12.230
