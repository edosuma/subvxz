WEBVTT

00:00.524 --> 00:02.271
Previously on The Royals...

00:02.529 --> 00:06.097
Your doctor called. He needs
to see you once. It's urgent.

00:06.531 --> 00:09.112
I have cancer. Of the balls.

00:09.113 --> 00:10.214
Testicular cancer?

00:10.215 --> 00:13.319
No, lung cancer in my balls.
Yes, testicular cancer.

00:14.064 --> 00:17.079
This was hanging around my neck the
night before the King was killed.

00:17.080 --> 00:17.867
It wasn't me.

00:17.868 --> 00:21.324
We figure this out, we figure out
who's been killing my family.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.004
And then we make them pay.

00:25.423 --> 00:26.439
Hey.

00:26.828 --> 00:28.480
Beck, what are you doing here?

00:28.684 --> 00:30.074
I left her.

00:30.296 --> 00:31.781
It's always been you.

00:33.609 --> 00:35.795
I like you when you say my name.

00:37.355 --> 00:38.988
(Whispers) Say it again.

00:38.990 --> 00:40.756
Eleanor.

00:41.692 --> 00:44.319
Your first order of
business is to pass our bill.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.218
Understood.

00:46.030 --> 00:47.696
- Is he?
- Yes. Dead.

00:48.733 --> 00:50.632
'Wait till Moorefield hears about this.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.569
He's been whoring himself out
to a couple of half-wits.'

00:53.571 --> 00:55.771
Get me a meeting with the
Deputy Prime Minister.

00:55.773 --> 00:57.890
I don't have time for
tea with the Queen.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.376
Tell her I'll think about
it and let her know.

01:02.246 --> 01:04.179
I don't believe in someday.

01:04.181 --> 01:05.881
Lucky for you I do.

01:07.618 --> 01:10.436
(NICK) 'I hope the fairy
tale works out for you.'

01:10.438 --> 01:12.621
- I really do.
- Nick...

01:13.741 --> 01:16.692
He saw you coming. The man
in the striped jacket.

01:16.694 --> 01:19.528
He called you... tenacious.

01:20.831 --> 01:24.867
You've been retracing Dad's steps
ever since the day he died.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.437
Retrace yours.

01:28.439 --> 01:31.340
Find that thing that...
that made you happy.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.443
I need to do some things alone,

01:34.445 --> 01:36.111
and I need you to trust me.

03:13.210 --> 03:14.376
- I did?
- Mm-hm.

03:14.378 --> 03:16.078
- I do.
- Mm.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.380
I do. I...

03:19.283 --> 03:21.350
I just don't quite remember saying it.

03:26.824 --> 03:28.524
- Okay.
- Hey!

03:30.628 --> 03:32.561
Nope. You packed the bowl,

03:32.563 --> 03:34.196
now go pack a bag.

03:34.198 --> 03:36.381
We're going away for the weekend.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.016
Where are we going?

03:38.018 --> 03:39.701
It's a surprise.

03:39.703 --> 03:42.271
Will it top the club opening
in Chelsea tonight, though?

03:42.273 --> 03:43.972
So much better than Chelsea.

03:44.775 --> 03:46.108
Just pack some things.

03:46.110 --> 03:48.794
I'll speak with James, and
see if he'll stand down.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.979
- James?
- Your security detail.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.599
Right. Yes, of course, James.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.151
He amuses me. James.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.554
You amuse me.

03:59.690 --> 04:01.540
Off we go.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.575
I love a surprise.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.495
(Bubbling)

04:10.167 --> 04:14.503
I hate surprises. Quit being
so dramatic and spit it out.

04:14.672 --> 04:17.339
Despite our best efforts
to eradicate your cancer,

04:17.341 --> 04:19.007
it seems we're losing the war.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.777
You say "we" as if
somehow you're involved.

04:21.779 --> 04:23.478
We need to remove a testicle.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.014
Let me get this straight.
We're losing the war,

04:26.016 --> 04:27.683
but I'm losing a nut. Which one?

04:28.319 --> 04:30.319
- I'm sorry?
- Which one am I losing?

04:31.038 --> 04:34.623
- Erm... Your right one.
- (Sighs) The big one.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.758
Your Majesty, try and
focus on the positives.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.677
Tell you what, I'll
hack off one of yours

04:38.679 --> 04:40.929
and let's see how positive you are.

04:40.931 --> 04:43.365
What I mean to say is that
by removing the testicle

04:43.367 --> 04:46.602
we feel strongly that we can
eradicate the cancer from your body.

04:46.604 --> 04:49.371
So I'll beat cancer but be a freak.

04:49.373 --> 04:52.741
Cosmetically, there are testicular
implants available. Prosthetics.

04:52.743 --> 04:55.060
I'll arrange for you
to see some samples.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.297
There's no other way?

04:58.299 --> 04:59.982
I'm afraid not.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.886
If I do this, I'll be okay?

05:05.222 --> 05:07.623
We have every reason to
believe you will be.

05:07.625 --> 05:09.524
Medically, we can only do so much.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.760
But positive thinking, diet, exercise,

05:11.762 --> 05:13.895
your support group,
these things matter.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.514
You're the King of England,

05:15.516 --> 05:17.666
you can engender the
goodwill of a nation.

05:17.668 --> 05:20.335
Channel the power of the
people who love you.

05:22.740 --> 05:25.040
So, basically, I'm screwed.

05:35.152 --> 05:36.785
(Footsteps)

05:38.422 --> 05:40.739
- Your Majesty?
- God's sake, it's about time.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.761
Why is she so late?

05:41.786 --> 05:44.684
The Deputy Prime Minister
won't be coming today.

05:46.063 --> 05:48.297
She'd better be dead,
like the last one.

05:48.299 --> 05:49.965
It seems she canceled.

05:49.967 --> 05:53.168
She sent word that she's simply
too busy to meet with you.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.275
Who do you think you are?

06:00.744 --> 06:02.294
Wow!

06:02.296 --> 06:04.212
It seems the press gang's all here.

06:04.214 --> 06:06.014
- Mr. Crenshaw.
- Your Majesty.

06:06.350 --> 06:08.467
And you must be our
Deputy Prime Minister.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.754
My apologies, they didn't
tell me you were disabled.

06:12.756 --> 06:15.991
Your Majesty, I seem to
have forgotten my manners.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.428
Yes, and for the second time today.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.237
Gentlemen, I look forward
to seeing you all soon.

06:29.740 --> 06:32.007
And let's be honest, not near as much

06:32.009 --> 06:33.709
as you look forward to seeing me.

06:33.711 --> 06:35.377
(Laughter)

06:36.630 --> 06:38.347
Walk away.

06:44.088 --> 06:47.572
Yes, you can all just... go out.

06:54.765 --> 06:57.265
- (Door closes)
- Please, sit.

06:57.267 --> 06:59.868
Perhaps a refresher
course in etiquette.

07:00.371 --> 07:03.772
I'm the Queen of England. I
speak first, I sit first,

07:03.774 --> 07:05.741
and I certainly don't wait for you.

07:05.743 --> 07:09.578
You wait for me and you don't cancel.

07:09.580 --> 07:11.913
Of course. My apologies.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.433
I think I'll sit.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.257
Might I say what an honor
and a privilege it is

07:22.259 --> 07:23.759
to meet Your Majesty.

07:23.761 --> 07:25.694
I've admired you since I was young.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.429
But not too young.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.682
You were recently working closely
with the Prime Minister, yes?

07:30.684 --> 07:33.001
On a bill to alter the
order of succession?

07:33.003 --> 07:35.103
The Prime Minister was
in full agreement

07:35.105 --> 07:37.355
that it was the right and
prudent thing to do.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.758
Cyrus's children are not
fit to rule the country.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.111
Of course they're not, but then...
none of you are.

07:43.814 --> 07:45.781
The people elect their leaders.

07:45.783 --> 07:47.716
The leaders protect their people.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.402
The monarchy is simply
a national exhibit.

07:50.404 --> 07:52.020
Like going to the zoo or visiting

07:52.022 --> 07:54.022
an antiquated part of our history.

07:54.024 --> 07:56.408
You intrigue me, um...

07:56.410 --> 07:58.510
Rani. It means queen.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.178
Of course it does.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.165
First you cancel your audience
with the actual Queen,

08:03.167 --> 08:05.217
not just someone with a pretend name,

08:05.219 --> 08:07.936
and then you call me antiquated.

08:08.238 --> 08:11.139
Both occasions simply reflect
the modernity of England.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.942
A Prime Minister's work is never done.

08:13.944 --> 08:16.678
You don't seem to understand
you're not yet Prime Minister

08:16.680 --> 08:19.281
and never will be if
I decide against it.

08:20.117 --> 08:22.751
It's tragic that you
actually believe that.

08:23.187 --> 08:26.221
And even more tragic that
everyone lets you believe it.

08:26.223 --> 08:30.525
No-one lets me do anything,
and certainly not you.

08:30.527 --> 08:32.894
- Do I offend Your Majesty?
- Yes, you do.

08:33.447 --> 08:36.431
Mostly with your stupidity, and
partly with your arrogance.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.701
But what's most offensive are
your knock-off Jimmy Choos.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.504
This is not Soho House Chicago.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.308
Pull yourself together.

08:46.310 --> 08:48.276
Your bill is dead, Queenie.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.413
And so is the only hope
you had with the people.

08:51.415 --> 08:54.015
And so is the last person
that sat in that chair.

08:54.017 --> 08:57.335
Don't get too comfortable. These
are shark-infested waters

08:57.337 --> 09:00.188
and those fake tits won't
keep you afloat for long.

09:02.493 --> 09:04.793
(Door opens and closes)

09:09.233 --> 09:11.199
- (LIAM) How's your coffee?
- (OPHELIA) I got tea.

09:11.201 --> 09:12.951
- Yours?
- I got coffee.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.669
- It's good.
- (Laughs)

09:16.640 --> 09:20.475
- I want to apologize.
- You don't have to.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.228
But I found out about your audition.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.863
I felt like I was putting you first.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.581
I was trying to be honorable.

09:26.583 --> 09:30.368
I was trying to shield you from
the dangers and madness of my world.

09:31.455 --> 09:34.339
But I should have asked you
instead of telling you.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.424
It was your choice to make, not mine.

09:38.629 --> 09:40.428
Thank you for saying that.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.798
I've missed you.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.270
That's not fair.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.640
Ophelia!

09:54.311 --> 09:56.228
I'm sorry.

10:25.982 --> 10:28.882
Tell me there's a music
festival or something nearby.

10:28.884 --> 10:30.517
Actually, the opposite.

10:30.519 --> 10:32.853
I thought you could use
a little quiet time.

10:32.855 --> 10:34.488
Why, have you met me?

10:34.490 --> 10:37.591
Never understood why people
like going to the country.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.276
There's nothing to do.

10:43.115 --> 10:44.865
I have an amazing bed.

10:46.068 --> 10:47.768
I like the country.

10:49.455 --> 10:51.839
- Come on.
- Ooh!

10:51.841 --> 10:54.591
♪ There's no use fighting... ♪

10:54.593 --> 10:56.310
So this is what it comes to.

10:57.113 --> 10:59.513
You wait your entire life to be King...

11:00.349 --> 11:02.032
..and then they cut off your balls.

11:02.568 --> 11:06.153
It's just one ball, sir. Sac
half full, if you will.

11:06.155 --> 11:10.290
Sir, if I may, perhaps the
doctor was onto something.

11:10.292 --> 11:12.693
I mean, the power of positive thinking.

11:12.695 --> 11:14.361
The support of the people.

11:14.964 --> 11:17.665
As you said, you've waited
a lifetime to be king.

11:18.467 --> 11:20.601
It would be a shame to
cut that lifetime short.

11:20.603 --> 11:22.286
Maybe you're right.

11:22.605 --> 11:24.238
Perhaps a charity.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.407
Or one of those bum buffets.

11:27.143 --> 11:29.626
I think the term is "soup
kitchen", Your Majesty.

11:29.628 --> 11:31.311
Soup kitchen!

11:32.715 --> 11:36.400
Lucius, have the press
meet us at a soup kitchen.

11:37.053 --> 11:39.720
Let's see if we can't
generate a little goodwill.

11:39.722 --> 11:41.372
Hm.

11:42.591 --> 11:45.209
Len.

11:45.211 --> 11:47.061
Put your phone away, you're missing it.

11:47.063 --> 11:48.729
What?

11:49.532 --> 11:52.116
Beck, I've seen the country.

11:54.537 --> 11:56.270
A girl needs to eat.

11:58.374 --> 12:00.257
You know that bed you
were bragging about?

12:00.259 --> 12:03.444
- Yeah.
- Picnic blanket is the new bed.

12:07.049 --> 12:08.682
(Cheering)

12:08.684 --> 12:10.768
(Applause and whistling)

12:14.356 --> 12:16.006
Oh!

12:18.677 --> 12:20.427
Come on.

12:25.167 --> 12:28.218
I asked you all here today
because I've had an epiphany.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.905
Our country has always
helped those less fortunate.

12:31.907 --> 12:34.475
It troubles me to see
so many with so little.

12:34.477 --> 12:37.811
And so I pledge to you all here today,

12:38.514 --> 12:39.780
the monarchy will match

12:39.782 --> 12:41.982
whatever funds Parliament will pledge,

12:41.984 --> 12:43.951
in perpetuity,

12:43.953 --> 12:47.020
in order to make us a happier,

12:47.022 --> 12:50.340
healthier, truly United Kingdom.

13:04.457 --> 13:06.857
You know the King owns all
mute swans in England.

13:07.343 --> 13:08.809
They're lucky to be mute.

13:08.811 --> 13:11.111
They don't have to worry
about what to say.

13:11.113 --> 13:12.763
I know you're upset with me.

13:12.765 --> 13:14.398
How could I not be?

13:14.400 --> 13:15.749
You know I care about dancing

13:15.751 --> 13:17.684
and you didn't think I
could do it on my own.

13:17.686 --> 13:20.220
That's absolutely not true.
I've always believed in you.

13:20.222 --> 13:22.573
At first I thought the other
dancers in the company

13:22.575 --> 13:25.092
were just avoiding me
because I was the new girl.

13:25.094 --> 13:27.628
Then I thought maybe it had
something to do with us.

13:28.497 --> 13:31.598
So, I tried befriending them and
that's when I learned the truth.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.567
That apparently my place in the company

13:33.569 --> 13:36.236
was the result of a favor
called in by the palace.

13:36.238 --> 13:38.489
Ophelia, I promise you I
knew nothing about this.

13:42.111 --> 13:45.212
It doesn't matter. I
couldn't stay there.

13:45.214 --> 13:47.214
- I didn't earn it.
- You did earn it.

13:47.950 --> 13:49.750
You'd have earned it every day.

13:50.636 --> 13:52.619
It was just like Monaco.

13:53.255 --> 13:56.290
Something that was real and
truthful, something that mattered,

13:56.292 --> 13:58.759
was twisted into something
ugly because of your world.

13:59.728 --> 14:02.963
I told you, Liam, I wanted
you, not your world.

14:02.965 --> 14:04.331
But they're both the same thing.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.466
- They don't have to be.
- Yes, they do.

14:06.468 --> 14:08.869
Your world is their
world, no matter what.

14:12.074 --> 14:13.957
I wish it wasn't, but it is.

14:15.127 --> 14:16.844
And it always will be.

14:20.366 --> 14:22.266
I wanted everything you wanted.

14:22.935 --> 14:24.651
With you and for you.

14:26.956 --> 14:28.922
I didn't know about the rest of it.

14:30.009 --> 14:31.725

- Well, let's see.

18:10.538 --> 18:12.421
I woke up to you smoking a bong,

18:12.423 --> 18:14.106
your bedroom looks like a chemist's

I'm merely suggesting

21:47.413 --> 21:50.314
there is a time for the whip
and a time for the feather.

21:50.316 --> 21:54.334
Considering the time and effort Her
Majesty has so skillfully invested,

21:54.336 --> 21:56.887
perhaps feather is the wiser play.

21:56.889 --> 21:58.555
Fine, I'll try the feather.

21:58.557 --> 22:00.757
If that doesn't work,
I'm burning Parliament

22:00.759 --> 22:02.559

out her shoe size.

22:08.117 --> 22:09.800
Of course, Your Majesty.

22:19.228 --> 22:21.311
Perhaps we got off on the wrong foot.

22:21.313 --> 22:23.580
The right foot should be wearing these.

22:25.017 --> 22:26.516

22:27.286 --> 22:29.386
But I'm afraid I can't accept them.

22:29.388 --> 22:31.238
Nonsense! Consider them a gift.

22:32.358 --> 22:34.591
But, you see, if I accept a gift,

22:34.593 --> 22:36.360
it could be perceived as a bribe,

22:36.362 --> 22:38.495

exactly what you want.

23:07.693 --> 23:09.760

position of power.

will quietly but effectively

23:17.536 --> 23:20.704

monarchy's time has passed.

23:21.373 --> 23:23.040

23:23.909 --> 23:27.561

are we such a threat?

23:28.981 --> 23:31.798

away, when you go away...

Your worst nightmare.

27:02.052 --> 27:03.718
- What do you want?
- Want?

27:03.720 --> 27:06.054
We want to have sex with you.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.156
- What?

Don't do that!

27:19.202 --> 27:22.370
Yeah, but didn't you love the idea of
being our sex slave just a little bit.

27:22.372 --> 27:24.789
- You are a piece of work.
- It was my brother's idea.

27:24.791 --> 27:26.775
We had to kidnap you to
take you out tonight.

27:26.777 --> 27:28.410
Guys, I'm not going
out, I'm going home.

27:28.412 --> 27:30.145

27:45.262 --> 27:46.961
Of course.

Hey! D-Throned. Leave her alone.

28:25.736 --> 28:28.470
- You just broke my phone.
- Yeah? I just broke a nail,

28:28.472 --> 28:30.372
and they cost more
than your shit phone.

28:30.374 --> 28:32.123
Slag.

28:32.876 --> 28:34.309

- All good.

know what slag means.

28:38.548 --> 28:40.265
I'll see ya.

28:43.754 --> 28:45.153
- She has a boyfriend.
- Ooh.

28:45.155 --> 28:46.821
I know the guy.

28:46.823 --> 28:48.623
Seems like what she wants.

28:48.625 --> 28:50.959
- What do you want?
- I want her to be happy.

28:51.595 --> 28:55.680
I want this beer, and about
six more just like them.

28:59.836 --> 29:01.903
Oh, my God!

29:02.539 --> 29:04.205
I'm drunk.

29:09.312 --> 29:12.414
Polo match. You were stalking
the stripy suit guy.

29:21.525 --> 29:23.475
Erm... maybe later.

29:25.762 --> 29:27.462
Disappointing.

29:33.737 --> 29:35.904
Okay, we love her.

29:37.574 --> 29:40.008
Oh, no. It's my dad.

29:43.947 --> 29:46.080
- I got it.
- You sure?

29:46.082 --> 29:47.882

30:09.506 --> 30:11.506
- What are you drinking?
- Shots.

30:11.758 --> 30:12.974
Of?

30:12.976 --> 30:14.859
I read once that if
you're gonna take a shot,

30:14.861 --> 30:17.345
it should be something you feel,
like, tequila or whiskey.

30:17.347 --> 30:19.147
Nothing with juice or some funny name.

30:19.616 --> 30:22.317
I absolutely agree. Who wrote that?

30:22.319 --> 30:24.486
I don't know. Hemingway or J.K.
Rowling.

30:24.488 --> 30:26.171
Someone like that.

30:26.173 --> 30:27.806
So, what's your poison?

30:27.808 --> 30:29.858
Drugs, booze, boys?

30:29.860 --> 30:31.910
- Yes!
- (Laughs) Okay.

30:31.912 --> 30:33.411
I hear that.

30:33.413 --> 30:35.797
Except the first two got me
in trouble with the third,

30:35.799 --> 30:39.834
so I kind of sexed him
into a coma and snuck out.

30:39.836 --> 30:42.737
Well played. So, no boys.

30:43.023 --> 30:44.873
How about booze? You game?

30:44.875 --> 30:46.674
I'm so game.

30:46.676 --> 30:49.043
- I'm Len.
- I know.

30:49.329 --> 30:51.846
I mean, I'd like to pretend
I'm all cool and I don't,

30:51.848 --> 30:54.282
but the truth is, your
fashion sense is amazing.

30:54.284 --> 30:56.184
We all think you're a badass rock star.

30:56.186 --> 30:57.886
- Who's we?
- Models.

30:57.888 --> 30:59.904
I'm a model. Mandy.

31:01.291 --> 31:02.824
To feeling this in the morning.

31:04.144 --> 31:06.027
Beats feeling nothing at all.

31:12.419 --> 31:15.470
Ahh! I'm telling you, they should
all be ashamed of themselves.

31:15.472 --> 31:17.639
Every so-called rock band out there.

31:17.641 --> 31:20.792
I was backstage at a Linkin Park show
and they were all on their laptops.

31:20.794 --> 31:22.510
Answering e-mails and doing charity.

31:22.512 --> 31:24.612
I said, "Oi. You're
supposed to be a rock band.

31:24.614 --> 31:27.081
Smash something, you pussies!" (Laughs)

31:27.851 --> 31:29.784
Oh. Alright. Here we go.

31:29.786 --> 31:31.986

this way all night.

31:31.988 --> 31:34.255
I hope she's looking at me, but
worried she's looking at you.

31:34.257 --> 31:38.326
And if she's looking at Ivan the whole
lot of us are gonna be disappointed.

31:38.328 --> 31:40.161
No, no, no, no.

31:40.163 --> 31:42.664
I do love my sons. Always will.

31:42.666 --> 31:44.198

wanted to leave with me?

32:04.220 --> 32:05.687
I'm sorry. I can't.

32:05.689 --> 32:08.022
Okay. I guess I tried.

32:08.024 --> 32:09.707
Hey.

32:12.929 --> 32:15.563

with you, because I can't.

Firstly, I was right about your ass.

33:46.056 --> 33:47.522

that got better than that?

33:57.283 --> 33:59.534
But what do I know? I'm
sure he's amazing.

33:59.536 --> 34:01.736
- Yeah.
- Timing is everything, right?

34:01.738 --> 34:03.237
Yeah.

34:03.239 --> 34:04.989
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

34:41.889 --> 34:44.290
A feather didn't work
with the Deputy PM.

34:44.292 --> 34:47.694
If I'm gonna pass my bill, I
need to find another way.

34:49.681 --> 34:51.347
I can ask around.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.984
Those PMs are rather kinky.

34:55.570 --> 34:57.553
A little blackmail goes a long way.

34:58.106 --> 35:00.690
Hm. Well, I guess it's
time for the whip.

35:01.526 --> 35:03.192
Literally.

35:06.297 --> 35:08.014

35:08.016 --> 35:09.399

35:09.401 --> 35:11.367
Stop here. I'll walk
the rest of the way.

35:11.369 --> 35:12.952

35:40.582 --> 35:43.132
It was fun. I'm sorry if I worried you.

35:45.603 --> 35:47.970
I was already worried.

35:48.173 --> 35:49.889
That's why I brought you here.

35:51.142 --> 35:53.810
I know who you are and
all that comes with it.

35:54.529 --> 35:57.814
I was just hoping I could add
a little quiet to your noise.

36:07.692 --> 36:10.059
Quiet is difficult for
me right now, Beck.

36:13.198 --> 36:16.332
The noise is... how I breathe.

36:16.668 --> 36:18.434
It's what gets me through the day.

36:19.003 --> 36:21.320
But you know that's temporary, right?

36:21.322 --> 36:22.989
It won't always be that way.

36:24.909 --> 36:26.576
What if it is?

36:28.663 --> 36:31.347
What if this is who... who I am?

36:32.851 --> 36:35.334
You know, you're always
telling me who I can be.

36:37.722 --> 36:39.889
What if this is me, this version?

36:40.475 --> 36:45.294
You know, loud, messy,
shit-show princess.

36:46.765 --> 36:48.798
It's not.

36:50.151 --> 36:52.585
Don't blame me for seeing a better you.

36:53.288 --> 36:55.304
For believing in the
best version of you.

36:55.306 --> 36:57.440

I love you for it.

36:59.461 --> 37:01.477

37:02.330 --> 37:04.864
But it just reminds me
of how broken I am.

37:07.502 --> 37:10.520
It makes me feel like I'm
constantly disappointing you.

37:12.824 --> 37:15.925
Not to mention that my
father felt the same way.

37:21.416 --> 37:23.282
You left your wife for me.

37:26.754 --> 37:31.073
I left my wife... and
the noise of her world.

37:32.577 --> 37:36.245
And then... I chose you.

37:38.283 --> 37:40.233
You have a type.

37:40.235 --> 37:41.918
No.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.003
There's no type when it comes to you.

37:45.190 --> 37:47.323
You're in a place all of your own.

37:50.728 --> 37:53.129
I know you mean that as a compliment.

37:57.235 --> 37:59.118

You shouldn't have been on your
feet after surgery like that.

40:39.297 --> 40:40.913
I didn't have surgery.

40:40.915 --> 40:44.166
My father had cancer.
He was stubborn too.

40:44.168 --> 40:46.419
I would prefer it if you
didn't speak of this.

40:46.421 --> 40:47.803

41:04.989 --> 41:07.390
- Who?
- People.

41:07.759 --> 41:10.009
They don't like me and they never will.

Not like the rest of them.

41:29.931 --> 41:32.314
You seem nice too. You're funny.

41:32.767 --> 41:35.267

if they like you or not?

41:35.269 --> 41:36.602
You're the King of England.
