00:52.803 --> 00:55.513
Mr. and Mrs. Campbell,

00:55.597 --> 00:57.598
I'm Dr. Stone.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.101
And how are we today?

01:00.185 --> 01:02.270
We're so pleased to be here.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.855
My friend, Sara Driscoll,

01:03.939 --> 01:06.441
her father is head of Obstetrics
at Lenox Hill.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.109
She said you get results.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.277
They got results.

01:09.361 --> 01:12.447
Sometimes all a young couple needs
is a good old-fashioned hand-holding.

01:12.531 --> 01:15.408
Have a seat, Mr. Campbell.

01:15.492 --> 01:20.913
Now, I am going to ask you
some questions together

01:20.998 --> 01:23.916
and more intimate ones separately.

01:24.001 --> 01:27.837
How long have you been
trying to conceiνe?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.922
Eighteen months.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.383
That sounds like a long time. Is it?

01:32.468 --> 01:34.927
Let's not worry about what's normal.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.597
Everyone is different.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.932
Are you two aware
of the principles of conception?

01:40.017 --> 01:41.934
Of how the sperm meets the egg?

01:42.019 --> 01:44.061
Yes.

01:44.146 --> 01:47.023
Although if you'd like
to show us some films...

01:48.317 --> 01:49.942
You'd be surprised.

01:50.027 --> 01:53.738
Prior to the decision to conceiνe,
were you using birth control?

01:53.822 --> 01:55.948
- She was.
- I used a diaphragm.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.284
Although it's possible I didn't need to.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.119
Mrs. Campbell.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.458
So we're walking in the park after lunch,

02:05.542 --> 02:09.128
and he sees these birds
picking seeds out of some horse shit,

02:09.213 --> 02:11.672
and he says, "Moνe over, fellows.
That's my job."

02:15.052 --> 02:17.678
That sounds like a visit
from the stork or De Beers.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.056
Or it could be just a new hairdo.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.142
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Draper.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.936
How are you this morning?

02:25.020 --> 02:26.270
Joan. Morning.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.649
Well, there's your answer.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.736
- Ever had mumps?
-Yes.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.822
How old were you?

02:35.906 --> 02:37.990
Summer of '45--

02:38.075 --> 02:39.492
1 1 , 1 2.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.911
Did your testicles descend normally?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.497
Absolutely.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.416
And have you ever fathered a child?

02:47.501 --> 02:49.001
No.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.921
Have you eνer had difficulty
completing the sexual act?

02:54.007 --> 02:57.009
Drinking doesn't help.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.010
But no.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.012
I always reach home base.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.473
Do you have difficulties with arousal?

03:02.558 --> 03:04.350
Jesus.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.103
I'm a red-blooded American male, okay?

03:07.187 --> 03:09.438
No one is questioning
your manhood, Mr. Campbell.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.232
You could be a warrior,

03:11.316 --> 03:14.026
an athlete, a bull of a man.

03:14.111 --> 03:17.280
George Washington was sterile.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.907
Fertility has nothing to do with manliness.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.287
Do you want to have a child?

03:24.371 --> 03:27.456
What kind of question is that?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.667
Of course I do.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.711
What man doesn't want a child?

03:34.506 --> 03:38.968
Although you think
about the world right now.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.095
The bomb...

03:41.221 --> 03:43.973
Do you worry about the world?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.850
Occasionally.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.981
Do you work with X-rays,
radioactive material,

03:52.065 --> 03:53.316
or toxic chemicals?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.067
I'm in adνertising.

03:55.152 --> 03:59.363
We got a Xerox machine,
but l don't use it.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.531
Not personally.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.241
Adνertising?

04:02.326 --> 04:03.534
Must be a lot of fun.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.244
Are you kidding?

04:05.329 --> 04:07.038
I'm an account man.

04:07.122 --> 04:10.708
I spend half my day tiptoeing
around creative crybabies

04:10.792 --> 04:13.044
and the other half drinking
with ungrateful turnips

04:13.128 --> 04:15.087
who just fell off the truck.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.924
I'm completely replaceable,

04:18.008 --> 04:20.760
even though I just brought in
a huge account.

04:22.387 --> 04:26.599
Then you throw this baby thing
on top of it,

04:26.683 --> 04:30.102
the economy contracting, my in-laws...

04:30.187 --> 04:32.021
Yes, it's a lot.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.106
What about your parents?

04:34.191 --> 04:36.108
My father just passed away.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.654
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.989
Do you think that has
something to do with this?

04:42.074 --> 04:43.449
It doesn't.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.743
I mean...

04:45.827 --> 04:48.120
I try not to think about it.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.413
It's been a few months.

04:49.498 --> 04:53.751
It is a difficult moment in the life cycle.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.212
But we are part
of a continuum, aren't we?

04:58.298 --> 05:01.008
So maybe I'm the end of the line.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.223
Well, that'll do it, Mr. Campbell.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.267
I think I feel better already.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.061
Can you send in your wife?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.146
And then I'd like you
to schedule a time with a nurse

05:14.231 --> 05:15.815
for a semen analysis.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.234
Whenever she's free.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.157
Red and green are my colors,
so we're gonna do Christmas.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.159
He doesn't know that yet.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.161
I can coνer Mr. Draper's desk for you.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.329
I know you'll have your hands full.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.539
You had your shot.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.040
It's beautiful.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.750
Miss Holloway,
those aren't wedding bells.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.169
I'm so sorry, Mr. Draper.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.171
Mr. Draper's office.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.256
One moment, please.

05:44.636 --> 05:47.179
Mr. Draper, Bobbie Barrett on line 1 .

05:47.264 --> 05:48.389
Thank you.

05:55.814 --> 05:59.358
Don, I want you to ask me how I am.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.194
How are you?

06:02.279 --> 06:04.196
Where are you right now?

06:04.281 --> 06:06.574
I'm in my office,

06:06.658 --> 06:09.243
where you called me.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.453
You sound a little tipsy.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.829
We did it.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.081
We sold Grin and Barrett.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.500
Congratulations. You got an order?

06:16.585 --> 06:19.378
No, but we're going to make a pilot.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.213
I remember that because Jimmy said,

06:21.298 --> 06:23.841
"Ask her. She's made
every pilot in town."

06:24.843 --> 06:26.260
Come celebrate with me.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.930
I'm at Sardi's, surrounded by clowns.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.100
And why would I come?

06:33.185 --> 06:36.979
I'm being ignored.
Come take up my time.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.232
I'm working.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.068
You provided key advice.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.861
We can call it business.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.156
No. Let's not confuse this.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.450
I'm about to change my mind.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.342
Thank you.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.345
Was there eνen a party?

07:10.347 --> 07:11.597
He'll have an old fashioned.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.020
Buddy Hackett told Jimmy

07:18.105 --> 07:19.480
that Gleason didn't have to make a pilot,

07:19.564 --> 07:21.899
so Jimmy went home to sulk,

07:21.983 --> 07:24.318
and the rest went out
to celebrate that they ruined his day.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.112
So here we are.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.865
I expect him to get this way
when it's bad,

07:29.950 --> 07:32.535
but when it's good?

07:32.619 --> 07:34.120
Maybe he doesn't understand
how big this is.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.287
No, he does.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.541
It's the big opportunity
he's bound to ruin.

07:50.971 --> 07:51.971
Mr. Draper.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.305
Miss Menken.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.308
Actually, it's Mrs. Katz.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.644
- This is my husband Tilden.
- Pleasure.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.149
Mr. Draper's firm did some work
for us a while back.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.400
Adνertising.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.614
I'm Bobbie Barrett.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.074
I'm sorry.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.494
Mrs. Barrett's husband
is a comedian who works with me.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.329
Nice to meet you.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.248
Tilden. I love comedians.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.918
So, how are things at Grey?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.628
Are they still taking credit
for everything we did?

08:24.713 --> 08:26.797
He's all business, isn't he?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.968
Now, Rach, we don't
want to miss the curtain.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.344
We haνe seats for
A Funny Thing Happened.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.305
Oh, it's wonderful.

08:34.389 --> 08:37.474
Well, you two enjoy working together.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.059
Nice to meet you.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.573
So, I would like some really good chow.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.366
Shall we go elsewhere?

08:54.451 --> 08:56.285
We can.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.079
Does feel a little cloudy in here right now.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.624
No, it's fine.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.377
So, tell me what I want.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.048
Steak tartare.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.092
Oh, my God, you're good.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.387
Hearts of palm salad. Steak tartare.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.848
I always order for Jimmy.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.850
Watch the money.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.978
Otherwise he ends up
sporting for people we don't know.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.482
He doesn't realize that being a big shot
means you don't have to pay.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.403
I think you're wrong about that.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.948
In the end, we're
in different businesses, okay?

09:36.201 --> 09:38.577
To a nice price on the pilot.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.626
And I boxed them in for 39
on the air if they order.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.711
You should have seen my neckline.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.297
You really do his business, don't you?

09:51.341 --> 09:53.717
lf it wasn't for me,
it wouldn't be Grin and Barrett.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.302
\t'd be Grin and Brownstein.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.264
This is America.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.517
Pick a job and then become
the person that does it.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.437
Well, that's true.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.815
Right after I met Jimmy,

10:07.899 --> 10:11.151
I watched somebody's Uncle Morty

10:11.236 --> 10:12.569
close a deal for him,

10:12.654 --> 10:15.489
and I realized
I negotiate for eνerything--

10:15.615 --> 10:18.450
the rent, the plumber, my hairdresser.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.537
I even did it in a department store once.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.373
It's touchy because
you're really telling somebody

10:24.457 --> 10:26.125
they're not worth what they think.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.085
But you can't hurt their feelings.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.754
Negotiating is a bore.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.965
It's hand-to-hand combat.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.011
You don't like negotiating.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.887
What the hell do you like?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.723
What do you mean?

10:40.807 --> 10:42.474
Doesn't haνe to be in business.

10:42.559 --> 10:43.559
I'll take anything.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.190
You can't even answer.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.860
The answer is huge.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.322
I don't think so.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.575
Do you like the ocean?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.494
Yes.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.579
Yes, I do.

11:05.665 --> 11:09.209
I have a little place in Stony Brook,
right on the shore.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.511
I want to have you on the beach.

11:19.596 --> 11:25.601
Feel the cold sand on my back
with the surf pounding behind us.

11:36.154 --> 11:39.323
I can smell the ocean.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.622
I loνe bridges.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.375
I don't know if it's the drop

11:49.459 --> 11:51.543
or just because
you get to see something

11:51.628 --> 11:54.463
disappearing behind you.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.714
Do you like bridges?

11:57.467 --> 11:58.425
I do.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.138
That's two things you like.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.265
What else?

12:07.644 --> 12:08.852
Movies.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.606
Yes. Spartacus?

12:15.402 --> 12:16.610
You seen the foreign ones?

12:16.736 --> 12:19.488
So sexy.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.117
Yes.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.830
Why is it so hard to just enjoy things?

12:31.668 --> 12:34.753
God, I feel so good.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.428
I don't feel a thing.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.639
You all right?

13:27.724 --> 13:29.308
Yeah.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.268
I think so.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.607
Are you okay in there?

13:52.165 --> 13:55.667
Mr. Draper, your wife says
that the whiskey was hers.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.670
But you did fail the sobriety test.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.672
You're at the legal limit--

14:00.757 --> 14:03.217
.1 5 percent.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.220
The fine's $1 50.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.765
May l?

14:26.616 --> 14:30.702
I have $63 and some subway tokens.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.204
I'll mail you the rest.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.457
I need you to pay the fine tonight.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.167
Or l can put you up.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.338
Let me call a cab,
and I'll send an employee

14:41.422 --> 14:43.715
out here with the $500
tomorrow morning.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.260
I bet you would, too.

14:46.344 --> 14:49.846
No, it's just 1 50.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.723
It's within my rights to detain you.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.600
What is the problem?

14:53.685 --> 14:57.479
People's kids are out on that road, sir.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.356
Call somebody.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.736
Or maybe your wife has a friend.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.778
I have $1 1 0.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.865
It's all l could get short notice.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.886
If you're going to be sick,
please tell me.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.890
This is my brother-in-law's car.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.809
I put $2.00 worth of gas in it.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.561
I don't want to have to clean it, too.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.777
Mr. Draper, I think
you should keep her awake.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.403
Bobbie, stay up!

16:36.704 --> 16:38.038
What?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.666
What do you think?

16:41.668 --> 16:42.834
Are you feeling okay?

16:42.919 --> 16:44.795
You can drop me off at Grand Central.

16:44.879 --> 16:45.837
Bobbie, what do you want to do?

16:45.922 --> 16:48.840
Jimmy can't see me this way.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.550
I shouId check in somewhere,

16:50.635 --> 16:51.718
see how the shiner does.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.972
Peggy, do you have a roommate?

16:56.057 --> 16:57.057
No.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.308
I don't know.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.144
No, you should stay with me.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.355
Just for the night, if you want.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.192
Mr. Draper, you need to rent a car.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.861
I can take you to LaGuardia.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.196
Idlewild is better.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.864
The Cross Island or the Belt Parkway.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.867
It's faster to take the Grand Central
to LaGuardia.

17:19.956 --> 17:22.416
I don't have any clothes.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.167
I wish l was your size.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.670
Do you have any dry cleaning?

17:26.754 --> 17:27.879
I'll pick it up.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.715
In the city.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.092
I'll go in and get it first thing.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.802
Okay?

17:36.431 --> 17:38.890
Hello.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.559
Leaνe her alone.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.066
No one in the office can know about this.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.276
It's business.

17:53.865 --> 17:56.241
You'll have to believe me
that I'll forget this.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.705
I don't want you treating me badly
because I remind you of it.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.792
This can be fixed.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.083
Where the hell were you?

18:47.168 --> 18:48.877
I was in an accident.

18:50.922 --> 18:54.049
What? Are you okay?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.425
What happened?

18:55.510 --> 18:58.970
By the time I could call,
I didn't want to wake you.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.555
Wake--

19:00.640 --> 19:01.556
Wake me?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.058
I've been awake all night.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.811
I knew something was wrong.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.395
I could feel it.

19:07.480 --> 19:12.442
I went to the doctor a while ago,
and I haνe high blood pressure.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.903
What the hell, Don?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.988
It's fine, except...

19:17.073 --> 19:17.989
he gave me a prescription,

19:18.074 --> 19:22.994
and l think the pills
mixed with the drinks was too much.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.996
I lost control of the car.

19:25.081 --> 19:29.000
Jesus. How could you
not tell me about this?

19:29.085 --> 19:30.919
I didn't want to worry you.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.589
I've been up all night.

19:34.674 --> 19:38.718
And now l find out you're sick
and you could have died?

19:38.803 --> 19:41.221
What did you want me to do?

19:41.305 --> 19:42.681
Have you come down there?

19:42.765 --> 19:44.683
Ask Francine in the middle of the night
to watch the kids

19:44.767 --> 19:46.017
because your husband's
in the drunk tank?

19:46.102 --> 19:49.521
Who cares if I couldn't help you?

19:49.605 --> 19:51.940
You should call me.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.024
I'm your wife.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.276
I was solving a problem, Bets.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.862
I need a clear head.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.989
You can't get all hysterical.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.910
I didn't know you were waiting up.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.791
You promised you wouldn't
disappear like that anymore.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.841
I have to get changed and go in.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.551
You're going to the office?

20:19.635 --> 20:23.430
I don't want anyone to know about this.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.056
I rented a car. I'll haνe to get my car.

20:25.141 --> 20:28.894
I don't care about the car, Don.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.770
My father has high blood pressure.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.275
I'll swing by Dr. McLattery on the way in.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.697
Just help me get dressed, okay?

20:53.127 --> 20:54.920
You can fend without me.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.674
I'm at a fat farm.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.968
One of your friends
made a crack about my ass.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.471
It doesn't matter who.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.563
Well, we're gonna be
all over the television,

21:13.648 --> 21:15.315
and the camera adds 1 0 pounds.

21:16.817 --> 21:20.320
No. You look fine.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.114
Jimmy, stop.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.115
You and l both know

21:24.200 --> 21:26.201
you should haνe behaved
yourself last night.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.579
I will.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.836
I couldn't find an ashtray.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.216
What's all this?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.634
I thought you might be hungry.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.136
It'll ruin my alibi.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.721
I need cottage cheese and champagne.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.724
I'm joking.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.061
Do you mind if I lay down
for a few minutes?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.771
I'm not used to being up all night.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.398
Of course, dear.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.025
And I got this to keep me company.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.235
I'll make up the couch for you.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.611
You must be beat, too.

22:01.696 --> 22:02.779
I'll make it.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.739
- Where are the linens?
- Just a minute.

22:09.453 --> 22:12.497
Oh, Marilyn.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.166
The tragedy you live.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.210
I'm sure glad I don't have problems.

22:18.546 --> 22:22.048
I think most women
would love to haνe her problems.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.300
Somebody said she's gonna
be at the fundraiser

22:24.385 --> 22:26.886
at the Garden on Saturday night.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.681
You know, the president's birthday?

22:29.765 --> 22:31.891
I really don't want to miss it.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.435
Do you have a headache?

22:33.519 --> 22:36.146
Because we had a little boy
in our neighborhood

22:36.230 --> 22:38.064
who fell off a swing set and hit his head

22:38.149 --> 22:39.315
and went to sleep.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.942
And then he died.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.279
Well, it's certainly
good to have company.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.823
I'm sorry. I shouldn't talk that way.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.787
I keep forgetting the accident.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.748
It was terrible.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.209
And it keeps getting stranger.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.212
If you're lucky, it will disappear.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.673
I have to lie down.

23:03.758 --> 23:05.300
Are you his secretary?

23:06.302 --> 23:08.303
No, but we work together.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.849
We'll both be handling
Mr. Draper for the time being.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.142
Now, you're a college girl,

23:14.226 --> 23:16.478
so I'm going to expect you
to jump in with haste.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.230
I have a lot of arrangements
to make for my wedding.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.608
Oh, my goodness. Congratulations.

23:21.692 --> 23:23.193
He's a doctor. He doesn't work here,

23:23.277 --> 23:25.236
so don't worry about putting
your foot in your mouth.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.696
Lucky you.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.740
Let me see?

23:28.824 --> 23:31.117
It's so liνely.

23:31.202 --> 23:34.329
You'd like to think it doesn't matter.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.209
l'νe been offered a few,
and this is by far the best.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.256
I'm a little bit clairvoyant,

23:45.341 --> 23:47.425
and I think you two are going
to be very happy together.

23:54.642 --> 23:56.601
I feel like I'm walking in tall cotton.

23:56.685 --> 24:00.730
Aren't you darling?
You're gonna be gangbusters.

24:00.815 --> 24:04.359
Mr. Draper is impatient.
Do not let it intimidate you.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.738
If it isn't the welcome wagon.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.490
Hello there.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.367
I'm Ken Cosgrove, Accounts.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.410
Paul Kinsey, copywriter.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.538
Harry Crane, married.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.623
Jane Siegel.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.750
Anything I can help
you gentlemen with?

24:20.835 --> 24:24.295
I actually need to see Mr. Draper.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.381
Is he in?

24:27.550 --> 24:29.425
- Morning, Don.
- Morning.

24:29.510 --> 24:32.011
Mr. Draper.

24:32.096 --> 24:34.430
I'd like you to meet Jane, the new girl.

24:34.515 --> 24:35.557
Morning.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.394
Can I talk to you for a minute?

24:42.231 --> 24:44.149
I'm gonna help you hold onto this one.

24:44.233 --> 24:48.069
I'm not paying attention anymore
until they're here a month.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.321
What happened to your wing?

24:50.406 --> 24:52.407
I missed the bottom step.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.411
It's an old house.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.621
I got an urgent call from Jimmy Barrett.

24:58.706 --> 25:00.331
He wants to come in.

25:00.416 --> 25:01.416
Why?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.709
He wouldn't say.

25:02.793 --> 25:05.378
Was he upset about something?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.046
Who can tell?

25:11.927 --> 25:13.344
I want you to put him off a few days,

25:13.429 --> 25:15.138
let him cool.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.264
He'll make more sense.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.349
Good idea.
He probably wants a rubdown.

25:18.434 --> 25:20.310
Paper says they ordered his pilot.

25:20.394 --> 25:21.895
Friday.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.356
Should I talk to your girl?

25:25.441 --> 25:26.566
I'll handle it.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.985
You bet.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.862
Get the door.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.001
Hello?

25:45.085 --> 25:46.377
Is eνerything okay?

25:46.462 --> 25:48.379
Yes, I think so.

25:48.464 --> 25:49.380
Is she awake?

25:49.465 --> 25:50.924
She's fine.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.385
Put her on.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.346
Just a minute.

26:04.855 --> 26:06.105
I didn't think you'd call.

26:06.190 --> 26:07.398
Why not?

26:07.483 --> 26:08.775
I don't know. I just--

26:09.777 --> 26:10.818
How are you?

26:10.903 --> 26:13.196
I don't know.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.281
Jimmy called.
He wants to meet with me.

26:15.366 --> 26:17.242
He does?

26:17.326 --> 26:19.661
I called him, and everything went fine.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.412
So you don't know
anything about this?

26:21.497 --> 26:23.414
You think I'd be in Brooklyn
if I didn't have to be?

26:23.499 --> 26:26.084
I talked to him.
I'm covered. Believe me.

26:26.168 --> 26:28.586
I do.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.046
Are you okay?

26:30.130 --> 26:32.882
I guess.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.300
You?

26:35.511 --> 26:37.428
It's going to be better.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.806
Good.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.349
Take care.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.070
Do you want to play cards or something?

26:54.154 --> 26:55.113
I think I have some.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.531
No.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.166
I'm sorry, but it's killing me.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.795
Why are you doing this?

27:10.879 --> 27:12.463
I don't know.

27:12.548 --> 27:13.673
He's my boss.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.633
Quite an example he's setting.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.555
Are you seeing him?

27:21.557 --> 27:22.640
No.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.143
So what, then?

27:25.227 --> 27:27.729
He's done a lot for me.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.480
He made me a copywriter.

27:29.565 --> 27:32.233
I bet you made yourself a copywriter.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.484
All these books.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.905
He's a decent man, isn't he?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.741
You wouldn't think he would be.

27:39.825 --> 27:43.161
I never expect him to be
any other way than what he is.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.550
We'll keep her here for another few weeks.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.511
She's still not in any condition
to make decisions for herself.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.221
She should be at home.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.724
Listen to the doctor, Mama.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.477
In this kind
of psychoneurotic disorder--

28:07.561 --> 28:10.021
Hello, Ma.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.314
Hello, dear.

28:13.609 --> 28:16.444
I'm afraid you'll haνe to leave us alone.

28:17.780 --> 28:21.157
I'm going, but I'm not leaving, Peaches.

28:32.461 --> 28:34.253
Hello, Peggy.

28:34.338 --> 28:36.381
How are you today?

28:36.465 --> 28:39.550
I still feel so tired.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.094
Do you know what year it is?

28:43.472 --> 28:44.806
It's 1 960.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.600
Do you know who the president is?

28:47.726 --> 28:50.561
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

28:50.646 --> 28:54.482
Good. Do you know
where you are, Peggy?

28:56.235 --> 28:58.027
St. Mary's.

28:58.112 --> 28:59.946
Do you know why you're here?

29:02.658 --> 29:04.325
No.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.452
You know St. Mary's is a hospital?

29:06.537 --> 29:07.912
Yes.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.665
Why do you think you're here?

29:13.419 --> 29:15.378
I don't know.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.883
I don't feel like myself.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.594
That's because we haνe you
on medication.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.681
We want you to be relaxed
so you feel more like talking.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.605
I told you what happened.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.357
You had a baby.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.661
You know, you can hear that outside.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.788
Nobody knows what I'm doing.

30:32.873 --> 30:35.041
It's good for mystique.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.671
So, Joanie, I hear
congratulations are in order.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.465
Yes.

30:42.549 --> 30:45.343
Marriage. Don't know why you'd want
to join that club, baby.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.678
Hasn't stopped you
from haνing a good time.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.347
How old is this guy?

30:49.431 --> 30:51.015
He's 34.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.351
What's wrong with him?

30:53.435 --> 30:54.894
Nothing.

30:54.978 --> 30:58.814
Well, I think it's nice to hear the story
of relatively young love.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.776
Are you being a concerned daddy?

31:03.278 --> 31:05.738
I'll tell you the same thing
I told my daughter.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.199
If you put a penny in a jar

31:08.283 --> 31:11.077
every time you make love
in the first year of marriage,

31:11.161 --> 31:12.870
and then you take
a penny out of the jar

31:12.955 --> 31:14.705
every time you make love
in the second year,

31:14.790 --> 31:15.790
you know what you have?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.625
A jar full of pennies.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.461
I envy that girl having you
to giνe her away.

31:22.589 --> 31:26.634
I've always been faithful
to whomeνer l was with.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.095
And despite your jokes,

31:29.179 --> 31:31.264
I always assumed you
were unhappy with Mona,

31:31.348 --> 31:32.807
not the whole idea.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.102
You aren't just another woman, Joanie.

31:36.186 --> 31:39.313
Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.482
I fell in love.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.486
Makes me sad.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.738
Just another reason
not to come in to work.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.532
I'm not going anywhere.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.242
Yes, you are.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.244
You'll see.

31:55.205 --> 31:57.331
Can I give you a couple paddles
for good luck?

32:13.724 --> 32:14.807
Coffee.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.894
Thanks for buying milk.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.063
I live alone. It always goes bad.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.983
So this really must be a kick in the head.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.320
Company is nice.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.738
Your eye's improved.

32:28.822 --> 32:30.781
That's good.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.451
l can cover the purple
with some green eye shadow.

32:33.535 --> 32:35.369
Complementary colors. We use that.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.954
Old trick.

32:37.039 --> 32:38.205
I was a dancer.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.500
I met a lot of interesting people.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.379
You have a boyfriend?

32:45.464 --> 32:46.881
No, l don't.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.719
So, are you in love with him?

32:51.803 --> 32:53.304
No.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.807
It's not a ridiculous question.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.267
Are you?

32:58.352 --> 33:00.436
It's a personal question,

33:00.520 --> 33:02.313
and I'νe already answered you.

33:04.191 --> 33:05.650
You're right.

33:11.365 --> 33:14.575
Aren't you going to ask me
if I'm in love with him?

33:14.660 --> 33:16.535
It's none of my business.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.872
You're right again.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.543
You're so young and beautiful.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.837
I'm not your competition.

33:28.924 --> 33:29.924
That's sweet.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.010
Is there anything else I can get you?

33:33.095 --> 33:35.763
No.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.223
I loνe your place.

33:39.685 --> 33:40.976
I've been trying to fix it up.

33:41.061 --> 33:44.605
Well, I like it. lt takes me back.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.832
Unless one of you needs help
finding a dead client file,

34:02.916 --> 34:04.959
I suggest you pitch
your tents elsewhere.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.216
I see what you're doing,

34:12.300 --> 34:13.884
and I haνe to say I'm disappointed.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.678
I don't follow.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.930
Your décolletage is distracting.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.891
This is an office that hinges
on professional decorum.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.894
I'm so sorry, Joan.

34:23.979 --> 34:25.813
I didn't realize.

34:25.897 --> 34:26.856
Better?

34:26.940 --> 34:28.733
Go out and get a sweater at lunch.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.110
Be reasonable.

34:31.194 --> 34:34.822
There's still plenty to see,
and you know that.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.455
Jane.

34:42.539 --> 34:47.918
I have some very important talent
coming in tomorrow to see Don,

34:48.003 --> 34:49.628
somebody famous,

34:49.713 --> 34:52.965
and I just want to make sure
you're aware of that.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.634
What's your title here?

34:55.719 --> 34:56.719
Title?

34:58.096 --> 34:59.847
I'm Ken.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.349
Cosgrove.

35:03.685 --> 35:04.894
Accounts.

35:04.978 --> 35:07.480
Yes, you're here in the book
with Jimmy Barrett.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.482
Would you like to go see him sometime?

35:11.151 --> 35:13.152
Hey. Listen to this.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.042
It's Mozart.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.062
You can use the mirror in the bedroom.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.272
No.

35:50.357 --> 35:54.026
Part of the process of learning
to live without your hospitality.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.694
It's nothing.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.990
Not true.

36:09.084 --> 36:13.462
I was curious if you're aware
of the value of your service.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.673
It's what you're supposed to do, isn't it?

36:16.508 --> 36:17.925
I wouldn't say that.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.302
People will take advantage of you.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.012
I know what l'm doing.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.059
What do you want?

36:28.103 --> 36:32.064
Are you just some busy little bee
building a hive out in Brooklyn?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.859
Are you still trying to say thank you?

36:36.903 --> 36:39.655
You have to start living the life
of the person you want to be.

36:39.739 --> 36:42.324
Is that what you did?

36:48.123 --> 36:50.332
You're never going to get that corner office

36:50.417 --> 36:53.210
until you start
treating Don as an equal.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.130
And no one will tell you this,

36:56.214 --> 36:58.007
but you can't be a man.

36:58.091 --> 37:00.676
Don't even try.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.970
Be a woman.

37:04.431 --> 37:07.391
It's a powerful business
when done correctly.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.232
Do you understand
what I'm saying, dear?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.320
I think so.

37:22.616 --> 37:27.077
How do l get to Grand Central from here,
steam ship?

37:27.162 --> 37:28.871
I can walk you to the train.

37:28.955 --> 37:29.997
It's two blocks oνer.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.165
I'll call a car.

37:37.047 --> 37:38.380
Hello?

37:43.053 --> 37:44.094
How was your day?

37:44.179 --> 37:46.639
Spectacular.

37:46.723 --> 37:49.850
Duck called Bert Peterson a mongoloid.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.602
What a leader of men.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.103
Dr. Stone's office rang.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.439
How is Dr. Stone?

37:55.523 --> 38:01.111
I didn't ask, but the nurse said
that your sample was quite viable.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.113
Is that right?

38:03.198 --> 38:06.408
Well. What do you know?

38:08.912 --> 38:12.790
That is a relief, I do say.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.041
Yes.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.671
Able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound, are they?

38:19.881 --> 38:20.881
I suppose.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.970
To viability.

38:28.682 --> 38:29.807
What? This is good.

38:29.891 --> 38:32.226
It is.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.479
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

38:35.563 --> 38:38.148
No, you're right. It's a relief.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.233
Now we know it's me.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.609
Right.

38:40.694 --> 38:44.238
So Stone can blow up your ovaries
or do whatever his cutting-edge plan is.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.366
Peter, I can't believe you.

38:47.450 --> 38:50.369
Wait a minute. You wanted to do this.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.538
You had to know this
was a possible outcome.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.040
Get back here!

38:55.125 --> 38:56.250
Trudy!

39:01.089 --> 39:02.798
Sit down.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.261
I'm sorry.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.597
I didn't think it through.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.142
That's honest.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.936
I don't know what I thought.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.189
Who says we have to do this?

39:19.274 --> 39:20.357
Except for what,

39:20.442 --> 39:22.484
it's the next thing we're supposed to do?

39:22.569 --> 39:24.486
But it is. It's natural.

39:24.571 --> 39:25.988
Says who?

39:27.657 --> 39:31.035
I was having a great time.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.411
Weren't you?

39:32.495 --> 39:35.831
Maybe this is the way
it's supposed to be.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.751
I mean, you have a baby.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.169
You can't traνel.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.671
You can't go to the movies
unless you have help,

39:42.756 --> 39:44.256
and that's expensiνe.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.342
You're immature, Peter, you know that?

39:47.427 --> 39:49.887
I just did a very private thing

39:49.971 --> 39:51.930
in a very public place for you.

39:52.015 --> 39:55.893
And guess what.
You don't like the results.

39:55.977 --> 39:57.478
What do you want me to do?

39:57.562 --> 40:00.272
Express some concern.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.232
And stop talking about
how you're going to miss

40:02.317 --> 40:04.818
seeing Cape Fearfor the third time.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.028
I know one thing.

40:06.112 --> 40:09.490
I sure as hell wouldn't want a kid here
watching this donnybrook.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.825
Either you make it through this thing,

40:11.910 --> 40:13.702
or you just keep it to yourself.

40:13.787 --> 40:15.079
I'm giving you that option.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.330
Stop!

40:19.542 --> 40:22.252
I'm sorry.

40:22.337 --> 40:23.670
I'm just--

40:26.341 --> 40:31.345
It's just l really do want a baby.

40:36.476 --> 40:39.103
What is all this for?

40:44.234 --> 40:45.734
I don't know.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.033
Can we eat now?

40:55.078 --> 40:56.829
Not here.

40:56.913 --> 40:58.163
Get your coat.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.410
Is that you?

41:38.371 --> 41:39.788
Are you really there?

41:39.873 --> 41:42.291
Yes, I am.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.419
What are you doing here?

41:47.422 --> 41:50.257
You got a promotion and disappeared.

41:51.384 --> 41:54.052
Your Christmas present
is sitting on your desk.

41:55.096 --> 41:56.346
I called your house,

41:56.431 --> 41:59.057
and your roommate gaνe me
your mother's number.

41:59.142 --> 42:01.059
Oh, God.

42:04.439 --> 42:07.691
Your mother told me you were quarantined.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.359
TB.

42:09.444 --> 42:13.363
I guess that was supposed
to lessen my concern.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.618
I'm sorry.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.453
What's wrong with you?

42:21.206 --> 42:22.623
I don't know.

42:22.707 --> 42:25.626
What do they want you to do?

42:28.421 --> 42:30.547
I don't know.

42:30.632 --> 42:32.466
Yes, you do.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.553
Do it.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.474
Do whateνer they say.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.272
Peggy, listen to me.

42:49.359 --> 42:53.403
Get out of here and move forward.

42:55.448 --> 42:57.491
This neνer happened.

43:00.245 --> 43:04.414
It will shock you
how much it never happened.

43:15.093 --> 43:17.427
It's old work, and we're
meeting early next week.

43:17.512 --> 43:19.179
The artwork is new.

43:19.264 --> 43:21.890
I'm going to see my
father-in-law this weekend,

43:21.975 --> 43:24.268
and he's going to ask me.

43:25.853 --> 43:28.480
Mr. Draper, Jimmy Barrett
is going to be early.

43:31.359 --> 43:33.110
I'm sorry l'm late.

43:33.194 --> 43:36.321
Don was asking where
we're going with this.

43:36.406 --> 43:38.740
I need more time. I was sick.

43:38.825 --> 43:41.451
I did my work.

43:42.870 --> 43:44.454
Should we bring someone else in?

43:44.539 --> 43:46.081
Throw it at Kurt and Smitty?

43:46.165 --> 43:48.667
I don't know. Miss Olson,
do you need some help?

43:48.751 --> 43:50.419
No. l'll have it first thing Monday.

43:50.503 --> 43:52.629
Yes, you will.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.019
Yes?

44:07.103 --> 44:09.479
Mr. Draper, I'm sorry I was unprepared.

44:09.564 --> 44:11.440
Don't let it happen again.

44:12.692 --> 44:15.027
Well, it's-- it's just that--

44:16.696 --> 44:17.779
What?

44:18.948 --> 44:22.159
$1 1 0 is a lot of money for me.

44:22.243 --> 44:23.452
Your baiI.

44:27.749 --> 44:28.790
Right.

44:35.590 --> 44:37.049
Here.

44:37.133 --> 44:39.593
I'll give you 50 tomorrow.

44:41.596 --> 44:43.513
I guess when you try
to forget something,

44:43.598 --> 44:45.390
you have to forget everything.

44:47.602 --> 44:49.269
Thank you, Don.

45:00.156 --> 45:02.532
Wow, Draper.

45:02.617 --> 45:04.534
Some kind of tomato farm you got here.

45:04.619 --> 45:05.786
Window dressing's important.

45:05.870 --> 45:07.537
Can I get you anything?

45:07.622 --> 45:09.873
I was going to ask you the same thing.

45:12.627 --> 45:14.628
Blondie, wait outside.

45:19.967 --> 45:23.553
Jimmy, Mrs. Barrett, you look good.

45:23.638 --> 45:25.555
You don't. What happened
to the flipper there?

45:25.640 --> 45:27.182
Old football injury.

45:27.266 --> 45:29.559
Yeah. I get those, too.

45:29.644 --> 45:31.561
Have a seat.

45:31.646 --> 45:34.314
No need. I'll keep this short.

45:35.942 --> 45:37.943
I just want to thank you
for convincing the folks at Utz

45:38.027 --> 45:39.653
to let me do the show.

45:41.656 --> 45:43.323
- My pleasure.
- Yeah.

45:43.408 --> 45:45.575
We all got what we wanted, didn't we?

45:45.660 --> 45:47.160
What l'm trying to say is,
the way I behaved,

45:47.245 --> 45:49.371
I wouldn't have been surprised
if you would have, you know,

45:49.455 --> 45:51.581
looked the other way
on this thing, blocked it up.

45:51.666 --> 45:53.125
Why would l do that?

45:54.210 --> 45:55.585
This guy.

45:55.670 --> 45:57.754
I can't tell if he's being smug or not.

46:00.049 --> 46:02.384
I just wanted you to know
that I'm not a bad guy.

46:03.678 --> 46:05.720
You didn't have to come all
the way in here to say that.

46:05.805 --> 46:06.930
I know that.

46:07.014 --> 46:08.765
Nobody knows that.

46:10.852 --> 46:12.269
You're a cool cat, Donnie.

46:13.563 --> 46:14.604
Okay.

46:14.689 --> 46:16.064
Bye, Mr. Draper.

46:31.956 --> 46:33.790
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

46:38.045 --> 46:39.171
How was your day?

46:40.715 --> 46:41.798
I made it.

47:01.736 --> 47:03.361
Where's the salt?

47:06.032 --> 47:07.657
Oh, Bets. No salt?

47:08.951 --> 47:10.660
You'll see. You'll get used to it.

47:10.745 --> 47:12.746
It's for your own good.

47:16.542 --> 47:18.376
What would we do without you?

47:19.420 --> 47:21.838
Why can't Daddy have salt?

47:22.924 --> 47:24.341
Because we love him.
