WEBVTT

00:02.631 --> 00:03.915
I don't know why I avoided

00:03.917 --> 00:05.500
the Harry Potter books
for so long.

00:05.502 --> 00:06.918
These are great.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.887
I just started number six.

00:08.889 --> 00:10.305
That's a good one.

00:10.307 --> 00:12.006
Dumbledore dies in that one.

00:14.393 --> 00:17.812
Yeah, I know,
I didn't see it coming, either.

00:17.814 --> 00:20.265
Why would you say that?

00:20.267 --> 00:21.499
You brought up
the subject.

00:21.501 --> 00:23.835
I contributed an interesting
fact on that subject.

00:23.837 --> 00:25.854
It's called the art
of conversation.

00:25.856 --> 00:27.405
Okay, your turn.

00:28.891 --> 00:30.909
That was a huge spoiler.

00:30.911 --> 00:32.677
Good.

00:32.679 --> 00:35.196
What is wrong with you?

00:35.198 --> 00:37.749
If I did that, you'd bitch
about it for weeks.

00:37.751 --> 00:39.200
Oh, really, Leonard?
Are you going to have

00:39.202 --> 00:40.151
another one of your hissy fits?

00:40.153 --> 00:43.154
Hissy fits?
<i>I</i> have hissy fits?

00:43.156 --> 00:45.540
Yes, and I have a theory why.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.926
Because of
your lactose intolerance,

00:47.928 --> 00:49.594
you switched over to soy milk.

00:49.596 --> 00:51.146
Soy contains

00:51.148 --> 00:53.164
estrogen-mimicking compounds.

00:53.166 --> 00:55.433
I think your morning Cocoa Puffs

00:55.435 --> 00:58.553
are turning you
into a hysterical woman.

01:02.091 --> 01:04.025
You are unbelievable.

01:04.027 --> 01:06.060
I don't know why
I put up with you.

01:06.062 --> 01:08.179
You're controlling,
you're irritating...

01:08.181 --> 01:10.565
There you go again--
nag, nag, nag.

01:11.617 --> 01:13.568
You're only proving my point,
little lady.

01:13.570 --> 01:16.521
You know what?
Screw you, Sheldon.

01:16.523 --> 01:19.124
You are the most annoying person
I have ever met.

01:19.126 --> 01:20.525
What? I'm annoying?

01:20.527 --> 01:22.794
You criticize my behavior
all the time.

01:22.796 --> 01:25.330
"Sheldon, don't talk
about your bowel movements

01:25.332 --> 01:26.864
over breakfast."

01:28.033 --> 01:29.667
"Sheldon, when the president
of the university

01:29.669 --> 01:31.553
"is giving a eulogy
at a funeral,

01:31.555 --> 01:33.838
don't yawn
and point at your watch."

01:33.840 --> 01:35.974
"Sheldon,
don't throw away my shirts

01:35.976 --> 01:37.225
'cause you think they're ugly."

01:37.227 --> 01:38.510
You're impossible.

01:38.512 --> 01:39.877
That's it. I don't...

01:39.879 --> 01:41.646
I don't have to
put up with this.

01:41.648 --> 01:43.965
Actually, I have your signature
on a roommate agreement

01:43.967 --> 01:45.383
that says you do.

01:45.385 --> 01:46.884
Aw.

01:46.886 --> 01:49.521
Here's what I think
of your roommate agreement.

01:53.042 --> 01:55.410
You pick that up right now.
No.

01:55.412 --> 01:57.829
Roommate agreement,
section 27, paragraph 5:

01:57.831 --> 01:59.781
The roommate agreement,
like the American flag,

01:59.783 --> 02:02.167
cannot touch the ground.

02:02.169 --> 02:04.402
I don't care.

02:04.404 --> 02:07.755
I don't have to do
anything you say because...

02:07.757 --> 02:10.708
I don't think I want
to live here anymore.

02:10.710 --> 02:11.976
Where are you going?

02:11.978 --> 02:14.579
To live with Penny and not you,
you crazy bastard.

02:14.581 --> 02:17.532
Crazy bastard?
Yes.

02:17.534 --> 02:19.584
Leonard, wait.
What?

02:20.352 --> 02:22.187

02:56.483 --> 02:57.500
Here you go.

02:57.502 --> 02:59.168
Great. Come on in.

02:59.170 --> 03:00.486
What, you don't say thank you?

03:00.488 --> 03:01.788
It's my suitcase.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.290
I lent it to you two years ago.

03:04.292 --> 03:05.625
Well, then, I should tell you

03:05.627 --> 03:07.377
I broke the wheel
and the handle.

03:10.848 --> 03:13.182
So, is everyone
from Bernadette's company

03:13.184 --> 03:14.333
going to Vegas?

03:14.335 --> 03:17.220
No, just me, her
and a couple of the big wigs.

03:17.222 --> 03:18.855
It's part of a bonus she got.

03:18.857 --> 03:21.224
Cool. Did she discover
a cure for something?

03:21.226 --> 03:22.308
Not exactly.

03:22.310 --> 03:24.227
They spent a ton of
money developing this

03:24.229 --> 03:26.479
dandruff medication
that had the side effect

03:26.481 --> 03:28.481
of horrible anal leakage.

03:31.068 --> 03:33.286
Is there a good
anal leakage?

03:35.689 --> 03:37.874
Anyway, it was
Bernie's idea

03:37.876 --> 03:39.959
to rebrand the stuff as a
cure for constipation.

03:41.212 --> 03:43.629
Way to make lemonade.

03:43.631 --> 03:46.532
You know, from around the
corner where fudge is made.

03:49.253 --> 03:51.671
Hey, I got a favor to ask.

03:51.673 --> 03:53.423
Sure.

03:53.425 --> 03:55.425
My mom's been kind of
an emotional wreck

03:55.427 --> 03:58.428
since that dentist
she was dating dumped her.

03:58.430 --> 04:00.346
Dumped her?
What, did he use a forklift?

04:04.217 --> 04:05.852
Sorry.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.438
There's nothing funny
about morbid obesity.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.056
She's huge. It was funny.

04:11.109 --> 04:12.442
Anyway, I was
just hoping

04:12.444 --> 04:15.061
that maybe you could check in
on her tomorrow night

04:15.063 --> 04:17.079
and make sure she's doing okay.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.732
Dude, I'm a single man.

04:19.733 --> 04:22.919
Saturday night
is my party night.

04:22.921 --> 04:25.371
Really?
What do you got going on?

04:25.373 --> 04:27.623
I don't know,
maybe drive down to Hollywood,

04:27.625 --> 04:30.293
hit a few hot spots,
see if I can get lucky.

04:30.295 --> 04:32.378
Okay, tell me
if this sounds familiar.

04:33.915 --> 04:36.248
You pay $15 to park,

04:36.250 --> 04:37.850
you stand on the sidewalk
for an hour

04:37.852 --> 04:39.552
until you break down
and give the bouncer

04:39.554 --> 04:40.686
20 bucks to let you in.

04:40.688 --> 04:42.188
You push your
way to the bar,

04:42.190 --> 04:44.307
where you drink
an $18 cosmopolitan,

04:44.309 --> 04:46.425
then you stare at a pretty girl

04:46.427 --> 04:48.561
and imagine your perfect life
together.

04:48.563 --> 04:49.862
Your children, grandchildren.

04:49.864 --> 04:51.614
Meanwhile, she leaves
with a guy who claims

04:51.616 --> 04:53.766
he wrote
<i>Beverly Hills Chihuahua.</i>

04:54.785 --> 04:56.652
Then you give up
on anyone ever loving you,

04:56.654 --> 04:58.104
go to Marie Callender's,
buy a pie

04:58.106 --> 05:01.874
and eat it in your car
in the parking lot.

05:02.810 --> 05:04.577
What time should I be
at your mother's?

05:04.579 --> 05:07.330
I told her around 7:00.

05:08.465 --> 05:11.000
I swear, that man is
the most egotistical,

05:11.002 --> 05:13.119
insufferable human
being I have ever met.

05:13.121 --> 05:15.922
Yeah, but you two make
such a cute couple.

05:17.808 --> 05:19.759
Like Burt and Ernie.

05:20.811 --> 05:24.730
You guys even teach me stuff
about words and numbers.

05:24.732 --> 05:26.732
Well, I've had it.
I am done.

05:26.734 --> 05:28.968
I can't... I can't live with him
for one more minute.

05:28.970 --> 05:30.853
Wow. Where are you going to go?

05:30.855 --> 05:33.122
I was thinking
here with you.

05:35.492 --> 05:37.443
Oh.

05:37.445 --> 05:39.478
That a problem?

05:39.480 --> 05:40.797
No, not at all.

05:40.799 --> 05:41.814
No, it's-it's great.

05:41.816 --> 05:43.082
It's terrific. I...

05:43.084 --> 05:45.651
You know, I just can't help
feel bad about Sheldon.

05:45.653 --> 05:46.652
I mean...

05:46.654 --> 05:49.038
how's he going to get by
without you?

05:49.040 --> 05:51.924
Ernie.

05:51.926 --> 05:53.709
He's got Amy now.

05:53.711 --> 05:56.162
Yeah, he does,
but it's not the same.

05:56.164 --> 05:57.430
Why?

05:58.382 --> 06:00.466
Um...

06:00.468 --> 06:02.018
Well, um, all right.

06:02.020 --> 06:04.353
You-you know how in <i>Harry Potter</i>
<i>and the Half-Blood Prince,</i>

06:04.355 --> 06:05.855
Ron didn't abandon Harry
just because

06:05.857 --> 06:07.557
Harry started
dating Ron's sister?

06:07.559 --> 06:10.593
Harry and Ginny
get together?

06:14.281 --> 06:16.532
Sorry.
Spoiler alert.

06:16.534 --> 06:19.518
My point is, as much
as I want to live with you,

06:19.520 --> 06:21.988
I can't do it knowing
how much Sheldon needs you.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.840
Please, the only
thing he needs me for

06:23.842 --> 06:25.408
is to be his whipping boy,

06:25.410 --> 06:27.710
his-his stooge, his doormat.

06:27.712 --> 06:30.529
Well, you know what they say:
if it ain't broke...

06:32.365 --> 06:33.833
Wow.

06:33.835 --> 06:36.419
It sounds to me like you don't
want us to live together.

06:36.421 --> 06:37.787
No. No, no, I do.

06:37.789 --> 06:39.205
I do. It's just...

06:39.207 --> 06:41.540
I mean, it's a really big step.

06:41.542 --> 06:42.541
Is it?

06:42.543 --> 06:43.709
We're together all the time.

06:43.711 --> 06:45.144
Financially,
it makes great sense.

06:45.146 --> 06:47.680
Can you think of one reason
why we shouldn't do this?

06:48.849 --> 06:51.517
Well... um...

06:51.519 --> 06:55.571
I'm just a little thirsty.
Yeah.

06:59.359 --> 07:01.777
I got nothing.

07:01.779 --> 07:03.329
Great. I'll go get my stuff.

07:03.331 --> 07:05.948
Yeah.

07:07.868 --> 07:10.569
Okay, all right,
don't freak out.

07:10.571 --> 07:12.838
You can make this work.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.241
Oh, could you clear off
a shelf for me in the bathroom?

07:15.243 --> 07:17.677
I take <i>a lot</i> of medicine.

07:18.512 --> 07:21.597
Oh, please let
some of it be Xanax.

07:25.052 --> 07:27.937
Are you ready for dessert?

07:29.974 --> 07:31.774
No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz.

07:31.776 --> 07:34.827
As it is, I'm going to have
to carry my stomach out of here

07:34.829 --> 07:37.429
like I'm a fireman
rescuing an infant.

07:39.266 --> 07:40.233
Oh, please.

07:40.235 --> 07:43.719
You're a tall glass
of brown water.

07:43.721 --> 07:45.121
Have dessert.

07:45.123 --> 07:46.822
Well, I-I really couldn't.

07:46.824 --> 07:49.075
But, uh, I've had a lovely time
eating your brisket

07:49.077 --> 07:51.577
and hearing about the things
you've had removed

07:51.579 --> 07:53.913
from your body over the years.

07:53.915 --> 07:57.116
Didn't know you could have
a cyst inside another cyst.

07:58.168 --> 08:00.937
The doctor said they were
like Russian nesting dolls.

08:00.939 --> 08:04.257
Well, if you have to go,

08:04.259 --> 08:07.593
how about I put a little
doggie bag together for you?

08:07.595 --> 08:09.762
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

08:14.067 --> 08:16.218
Mrs. Wolowitz, uh...

08:16.220 --> 08:18.104
are you okay?

08:18.106 --> 08:19.272
Don't mind me.

08:19.274 --> 08:21.140
I just cry
when I'm lonely

08:21.142 --> 08:23.759
and have nothing
to live for.

08:28.715 --> 08:30.750
I, uh...

08:30.752 --> 08:33.085
I suppose I could stay
for some dessert.

08:33.087 --> 08:35.187
Great. You like
chocolate chip cheesecake?

08:35.188 --> 08:36.554
Sure.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.758
I'll make one.

08:41.260 --> 08:45.097
One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk
action figure.

08:45.099 --> 08:46.465
That's Leonard's.

08:46.467 --> 08:49.268
Children's toy.

08:49.270 --> 08:52.605
One <i>Star Trek:</i>
<i>The Next Generation</i> phaser.

08:52.607 --> 08:53.973
That's Leonard's.

08:53.975 --> 08:57.059
Children's toy.

08:57.061 --> 09:01.314
One <i>Game of Thrones</i> collector's
edition Longclaw sword.

09:01.316 --> 09:04.200
Oh... Leonard and I
bought that together.

09:04.202 --> 09:07.370
That's a bit
of an ethical conundrum.

09:08.238 --> 09:10.873
Eh, I'll keep it.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.359
So, uh, what's your plan
moving forward?

09:13.361 --> 09:16.962
Uh, suppose I'll have to find
and cultivate a new roommate.

09:16.964 --> 09:18.881
What a task
that will be.

09:18.883 --> 09:22.551
Do you know how uncivilized
Leonard was when I took him in?

09:22.553 --> 09:24.236
No.

09:24.238 --> 09:28.424
Oh, it took me forever to get
him on a bathroom schedule.

09:28.426 --> 09:32.044
He would just go
whenever the mood struck him.

09:32.046 --> 09:33.879
Like a dog-boy.

09:33.881 --> 09:35.881
Exactly.

09:35.883 --> 09:37.516
What if you could
find a roommate

09:37.518 --> 09:39.268
who was a scientist

09:39.270 --> 09:42.104
and already familiar
and comfortable with your ways?

09:42.106 --> 09:43.672
That would be ideal.

09:43.674 --> 09:45.341
If a person like that existed,

09:45.343 --> 09:48.027
I would sign on,
no further questions asked.

09:48.862 --> 09:51.447
Great. Here I am!

09:56.536 --> 09:58.254
Wait.

09:58.256 --> 10:00.239
Here who is where?

10:00.241 --> 10:02.291
Me.

10:02.293 --> 10:05.094
Aren't I your
perfect roommate?

10:05.096 --> 10:07.079
Um...

10:07.081 --> 10:08.381
Think about it, Sheldon.

10:08.383 --> 10:09.515
I'm not a stranger,

10:09.517 --> 10:11.133
we're intellectually
compatible,

10:11.135 --> 10:13.252
I'm willing to chauffeur
you around town,

10:13.254 --> 10:14.520
and your personality quirks,

10:14.522 --> 10:16.472
which others find abhorrent
or rage-inducing,

10:16.474 --> 10:18.224
I find cute as a button.

10:19.443 --> 10:21.360
What do you think?

10:27.150 --> 10:29.285
Um...

10:29.287 --> 10:32.571
Tell me one reason why this
isn't a fantastic idea.

10:32.573 --> 10:35.274
Um...

10:35.276 --> 10:37.326
See? You can't.

10:37.328 --> 10:38.794
I'm gonna go see
if Leonard's room

10:38.796 --> 10:41.213
is big enough for my water bed.

10:43.616 --> 10:46.001
Um...

10:47.104 --> 10:50.289
Good buddy Leonard.
Good buddy Leonard.

10:50.291 --> 10:53.476
Good buddy Leonard.

10:54.311 --> 10:55.728
What do you want?

10:55.730 --> 10:58.264
Hey, good buddy.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.348
So, uh, I was

10:59.350 --> 11:00.933
just talking to Amy,

11:00.935 --> 11:02.268
and she made me realize

11:02.270 --> 11:04.687
that this little dust-up
between you and me

11:04.689 --> 11:06.272
is much ado about nothing.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.523
Is that so?

11:07.525 --> 11:08.640
Yes.

11:08.642 --> 11:10.659
All is forgiven,
so come back home.

11:10.661 --> 11:12.945
I'll make you
some soy hot chocolate,

11:12.947 --> 11:15.414
and then I'll you tell you
about our exciting new

11:15.416 --> 11:18.083
devil-may-care bathroom policy.

11:21.505 --> 11:23.155
Cut to the chase, Sheldon.

11:23.157 --> 11:25.841
Okay. Amy's decided
she wants to move in with me,

11:25.843 --> 11:28.677
so I need you to come back home,
you lovable scamp.

11:30.163 --> 11:32.715
That's a lot of product.

11:32.717 --> 11:33.832
Hey.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.217
What's going on?
Oh, get this:

11:35.219 --> 11:36.635
Suddenly, Sheldon
wants me back

11:36.637 --> 11:39.171
because Amy wants
to move in with him.

11:39.173 --> 11:41.173
Really? Interesting.

11:41.175 --> 11:43.976
Well, too late, pal.
I'm not going anywhere.

11:43.978 --> 11:46.278
Penny and I are very happy
living together.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.446
Isn't that right?

11:47.448 --> 11:48.647
It's like the happiness

11:48.649 --> 11:51.317
won't ever leave
the apartment.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.485
Leonard, please.

11:52.487 --> 11:54.737
You know Amy moving in
marks a level of intimacy

11:54.739 --> 11:56.688
our relationship
isn't ready for.

11:56.690 --> 11:59.074
Yes! That is a real thing.

11:59.076 --> 12:01.193
And it doesn't mean you
don't care about each other;

12:01.195 --> 12:03.162
it just means things
are moving at a pace

12:03.164 --> 12:05.197
you're not comfortable with,
and that's fine.

12:05.199 --> 12:07.132
Well, if he doesn't
want to live with her,

12:07.134 --> 12:09.001
then he should
tell her how he feels.

12:09.003 --> 12:10.920
Well, maybe he doesn't
know how to say it

12:10.922 --> 12:12.087
without hurting
her feelings.

12:12.089 --> 12:13.138
Feelings?

12:13.140 --> 12:15.641
What am I, a hippie
at a love-in? No.

12:15.643 --> 12:17.042
The problem is,

12:17.044 --> 12:18.761
she laid out a series
of logical arguments

12:18.763 --> 12:19.845
that I couldn't refute.

12:19.847 --> 12:21.146
That is the worst,
isn't it?

12:21.148 --> 12:22.714
Yes.

12:22.716 --> 12:24.934
I'm sorry, Sheldon.
I can't help you.

12:24.936 --> 12:26.101
Oh, spoiler alert:

12:26.103 --> 12:28.571
This door's about
to slam in your face.

12:29.739 --> 12:31.073
Oh, there you are.

12:31.992 --> 12:34.960
When do I get a key
to our apartment?

12:36.780 --> 12:38.998
Um...

12:40.000 --> 12:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:55.520 --> 12:56.654
Hello?

12:56.656 --> 12:58.839
Hey. How'd it go last night
with my mom?

12:58.841 --> 13:00.758
Okay, I guess.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.076
What time did you leave?

13:04.213 --> 13:07.531
Actually, I'm still here.

13:07.533 --> 13:10.200
What? You spent the night?

13:10.202 --> 13:12.019
Yeah. Uh...

13:12.021 --> 13:16.040
after dinner, we watched
a rerun of <i>Rockford Files,</i>

13:16.042 --> 13:17.642
and then she opened a bottle

13:17.644 --> 13:20.210
of, uh, cream sherry,
and the next thing I know,

13:20.212 --> 13:23.514
she was tucking me
into your bed.

13:23.516 --> 13:26.400
You wore my pajamas?

13:26.402 --> 13:27.551
Mm-hmm.

13:27.553 --> 13:29.403
How do you sleep
in these things?

13:29.405 --> 13:31.238
Silk pajamas on satin sheets?

13:31.240 --> 13:34.275
I slid out of the bed,
like, three times.

13:34.277 --> 13:36.661
Rajesh!

13:36.663 --> 13:37.795
You up?

13:37.797 --> 13:39.080
You ready for breakfast?

13:39.082 --> 13:41.032
Oh, boy. Breakfast.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.084
Okay, Raj, listen to me.

13:43.086 --> 13:44.568
You need to get out of there.

13:44.570 --> 13:49.707
But I have a cream sherry
hangover and I smell blintzes.

13:49.709 --> 13:52.426
If you don't leave now,
she'll use food and guilt

13:52.428 --> 13:54.595
to keep you there
for the rest of your life.

13:54.597 --> 13:56.430
Oh, Howard, stop.

13:56.432 --> 13:57.631
Trust me, you're not Jewish.

13:57.633 --> 13:58.883
That's how they get you.

13:58.885 --> 14:01.469
You're being silly.

14:01.471 --> 14:03.521
I can leave whenever I want.

14:03.523 --> 14:05.756
Oh, really? Where are
your clothes and your shoes?

14:05.758 --> 14:08.292
They're on the chair,
right over...

14:09.695 --> 14:12.463
Oy vey.

14:16.618 --> 14:18.719
Hello, home wrecker.

14:21.406 --> 14:22.990
What did I do?

14:22.992 --> 14:24.759
You gave Leonard
somewhere to go.

14:24.761 --> 14:28.145
Thanks to you, Amy's out buying
his and hers bath towels.

14:28.147 --> 14:30.214
Like I'd ever dry myself
with something

14:30.216 --> 14:32.466
that has a possessive pronoun
on it.

14:32.468 --> 14:34.135
Okay.

14:34.137 --> 14:37.121
Listen, the truth is

14:37.123 --> 14:38.506
I don't want him living with me.

14:38.508 --> 14:40.091
Great. Kick him out.

14:40.093 --> 14:42.309
Break his heart.
Everybody wins.

14:42.311 --> 14:43.978
No, I don't want
to break his heart.

14:43.980 --> 14:45.262
I love him.

14:45.264 --> 14:46.731
This is just happening too fast.

14:46.733 --> 14:47.965
You think this is fast?

14:47.967 --> 14:49.183
It's just a matter of time

14:49.185 --> 14:51.635
before I see Amy's leg stubble
in my shower.

14:51.637 --> 14:53.404
Yeah, and I've seen those legs.

14:53.406 --> 14:56.524
You might want
to get some Drano.

14:56.526 --> 14:58.109
Hold on.

14:58.111 --> 15:00.027
If you don't want
to live with Leonard,

15:00.029 --> 15:01.311
why don't you just tell him?

15:01.313 --> 15:02.663
Well, you know how he is.

15:02.665 --> 15:04.165
He's sensitive and emotional.

15:04.167 --> 15:08.202
That's because he drinks
too much soy milk.

15:08.204 --> 15:09.837
Well, I don't know
what else we can do

15:09.839 --> 15:11.038
but tell them the truth.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.757
I suppose there's no choice

15:12.759 --> 15:15.593
but to face the crying,
angry accusations

15:15.595 --> 15:17.645
and the high-pitched wails
of despair.

15:17.647 --> 15:18.946
Yeah.

15:18.948 --> 15:21.882
And who knows
how Amy will react.

15:25.303 --> 15:27.004
Here's some more ice.

15:27.006 --> 15:28.806
Oh, thanks.

15:28.808 --> 15:30.691
What were we thinking?

15:30.693 --> 15:34.228
We should have just done it
the regular way.

15:34.230 --> 15:36.513
Those Chinese acrobats
in Cirque du Soleil

15:36.515 --> 15:39.116
made it look so easy.

15:39.118 --> 15:41.986
Honestly,
if I could bend that far,

15:41.988 --> 15:44.822
what would I need with you?

15:46.241 --> 15:49.660
If you could bend that far,
you'd be doing us both a favor.

15:57.169 --> 15:58.752
Hey, Raj. What's up?

15:58.754 --> 15:59.870
You were right!

15:59.872 --> 16:02.173
I can't get out of here!

16:02.175 --> 16:04.258
You're still
at my mother's?

16:04.260 --> 16:05.375
I'm trapped.

16:05.377 --> 16:07.478
My clothes have been
in the laundry all day,

16:07.480 --> 16:08.946
and she hid my keys.

16:08.948 --> 16:10.898
I think they might be
in her bra,

16:10.900 --> 16:13.350
because she jingles
when she walks.

16:13.352 --> 16:14.885
What do I do?

16:14.887 --> 16:16.604
Hey, you wanted a woman
in your life.

16:16.606 --> 16:18.572
Now you got one.

16:18.574 --> 16:20.441
Come on, Howard, help me.

16:20.443 --> 16:23.894
Rajesh, <i>tatellah,</i>
I ran you a bath.

16:23.896 --> 16:26.664
Oh, my God.

16:26.666 --> 16:30.618
She's not gonna bathe me,
is she?

16:32.137 --> 16:35.372
Gee, I wish I could tell you no.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.428
All right, well,
thanks again for helping me out.

16:41.430 --> 16:43.380
But, Howard...

16:43.382 --> 16:45.432
Should we go back
and rescue him?

16:45.434 --> 16:46.634
It's too late.

16:46.636 --> 16:48.418
We'll see him
at his Bar Mitzvah.

16:50.689 --> 16:52.256
Here you go.

16:52.258 --> 16:55.309
I picked up the Chinese food
just the way Leonard used to.

16:55.311 --> 16:57.311
Is it kung pao chicken?
Yes.

16:57.313 --> 16:59.230
Brown rice, not white rice?
Yes.

16:59.232 --> 17:00.781
Spicy mustard
from the Korean deli?

17:00.783 --> 17:02.283
Yes. I did good, right?

17:02.285 --> 17:04.768
Yes.

17:05.619 --> 17:07.436
Amy,

17:07.439 --> 17:10.273
are you worried
that us living together

17:10.276 --> 17:12.960
will take the mystery
out of our relationship?

17:12.962 --> 17:13.961
No.

17:13.963 --> 17:16.297
Yeah, why would you?

17:16.299 --> 17:18.299
Oh, and, uh, check this out.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.666
I took the liberty of scripting

17:19.669 --> 17:21.969
a new outgoing voice mail
message for both of us.

17:26.340 --> 17:28.175
"Hello. This is Sheldon."

17:28.176 --> 17:29.393
"And this is Amy."

17:29.395 --> 17:31.061
"We're not home right now."

17:31.063 --> 17:34.348
"'Cause we out
dropping science, son."

17:39.371 --> 17:41.705
"Leave a message."

17:43.942 --> 17:45.159
Beep.

17:47.613 --> 17:50.164
You can't live here.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.016
What?

17:52.018 --> 17:53.334
Why?

17:53.336 --> 17:54.585
Is it the message?

17:54.587 --> 17:57.254
I only used urban slang
to sound tough

17:57.256 --> 17:59.206
so people wouldn't break in.
No.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.258
It's not the message.

18:01.260 --> 18:02.659
Well, what is it, then?

18:02.661 --> 18:04.511
I did everything
just the way you like it.

18:04.513 --> 18:07.331
You did.
Then what the hell, Sheldon?!

18:08.950 --> 18:11.668
We have been going out
for over two years,

18:11.670 --> 18:14.104
and I have been nothing
but patient with you!

18:14.106 --> 18:16.140
I watch your dopey
space movies.

18:16.142 --> 18:18.309
I signed your
ridiculous contract.

18:18.311 --> 18:20.144
I even stopped wearing lip gloss
'cause you said

18:20.146 --> 18:22.179
it made my mouth look
too slippery.

18:23.064 --> 18:25.182
I am the best
girlfriend

18:25.184 --> 18:26.567
you're ever
gonna have.

18:26.569 --> 18:29.570
You give me one good reason
why I can't live here.

18:30.405 --> 18:32.539
It's Penny's fault.

18:32.541 --> 18:33.958
What?

18:33.960 --> 18:35.359
She doesn't want
to live with Leonard,

18:35.361 --> 18:36.994
so he has to come
live here again.

18:36.996 --> 18:38.379
She's the snake in our garden.

18:39.631 --> 18:42.383
She's the reason
we can't be happy.

18:45.203 --> 18:46.253
Hey, Ames.
Yeah.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.554
"Hey, Ames," nothing.

18:47.556 --> 18:49.723
I was all set to move in
with Sheldon, and now I hear

18:49.725 --> 18:51.508
I can't 'cause you don't want
to live with Leonard.

18:51.510 --> 18:53.377
What?

18:54.729 --> 18:57.982
Sheldon, what did you say?
I said the truth.

18:57.984 --> 19:00.217
You don't want to live with
Leonard, and you know it.

19:00.219 --> 19:01.590
Since when don't you want
to live with me?

19:01.615 --> 19:02.720
Oh, don't get all huffy.

19:02.721 --> 19:04.054
You're the one who
decided to move in

19:04.056 --> 19:05.439
without even asking
me if I was ready.

19:05.441 --> 19:07.074
Yeah, I think we should talk
about that.

19:07.909 --> 19:09.743
And since you love
the truth so much,

19:09.745 --> 19:12.246
why don't you tell Amy you
don't want to live with her

19:12.248 --> 19:13.697
instead of
blaming it on me?

19:13.699 --> 19:16.400
I thought we were talking
about the other thing.

19:17.235 --> 19:18.619
You're a coward.

19:18.621 --> 19:22.256
Well, the evidence
does support that.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.742
Come on, Amy,
let's go drink wine

19:25.744 --> 19:28.212
and talk about what jerks
our boyfriends are.

19:28.214 --> 19:29.680
You know what would show them?

19:29.682 --> 19:31.548
I should move in here with you.

19:34.602 --> 19:36.770
Um...

19:47.399 --> 19:48.699
Do you want to...

19:48.701 --> 19:50.767
catch up on some <i>Walking Dead?</i>

19:50.769 --> 19:52.953
Okay.

19:54.272 --> 19:56.740
Have you seen the one
where Lori dies?

20:01.846 --> 20:03.997
No.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.283
Or maybe she doesn't.

20:06.285 --> 20:08.001
Let's find out.

20:24.284 --> 20:26.419
