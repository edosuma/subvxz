A tragic accident today
in the North Providence area.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.623
A family of four
lost their lives

00:39.706 --> 00:41.792
when their minivan swerved off
the road and into a ravine

00:41.875 --> 00:43.502
exploding on impact.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.837
( snickers )

00:44.920 --> 00:46.046
Do you find
this funny, Tom?

00:46.129 --> 00:47.381
Oh, no, no, no.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.466
I was remembering I accidentally
put my shirt on

00:49.550 --> 00:50.968
inside out this morning.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.427
It's fine now, though.

00:52.511 --> 00:55.430
S-so wh-what were you saying
about a f-fashion show?

00:55.514 --> 00:57.015
Chris, turn the TV off.

00:57.099 --> 00:59.101
We got to find an anniversary
gift for Mom and Dad.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.894
Don't look!

01:00.978 --> 01:02.479
We're shopping,
we're shopping!!

01:02.563 --> 01:05.023
Oh, kids, you don't need to do
anything special

01:05.107 --> 01:07.234
for our anniversary,
just your father.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.902
I hope he doesn't wait

01:08.986 --> 01:10.404
and get your gift
at the last minute again.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.614
My goodness, a human thumb.

01:12.698 --> 01:15.117
Where did you ever
find this?

01:15.200 --> 01:16.785
It was on E-bay...

01:16.869 --> 01:18.537
( throws up )

01:18.620 --> 01:19.997
Oh, God, call
an ambulance!

01:20.080 --> 01:22.207
This year, instead of
exchanging gifts

01:22.291 --> 01:23.917
I told him it'd be nice

01:24.001 --> 01:26.170
if we could just spend
a romantic day together.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.714
Oh, dear, I think we all know
what that means...

01:28.797 --> 01:29.882
Boy-yoy-yoy yoy-yoy-ying!

01:29.965 --> 01:31.049
Gross.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.803
Hey, fellas, guess what.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.890
I got us a tee time tomorrow at
Barrington Country Club.

01:37.973 --> 01:39.016
Barrington, wow.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.392
I'm in.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.227
Uh, Peter, tomorrow's
your anniversary.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.812
Ah, crap.

01:43.896 --> 01:46.023
If Lois finds out
I'm ditching her to play golf

01:46.106 --> 01:48.233
she'll hit me
with a frying pan.

01:48.317 --> 01:52.237
Which is why I'm going to drink
this frying pan antidote.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.281
All right, hit me
with this.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.782
Didn't work.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.219
What the hell?

02:15.302 --> 02:18.347
"Lois, it's an anniversary
scavenger hunt.

02:18.430 --> 02:22.059
Your first clue is at the
Quahog Mini-mart. Love, Peter."

02:22.142 --> 02:23.477
Oh, how fun!

02:27.147 --> 02:29.316
All right, gentlemen,
before you tee off

02:29.399 --> 02:32.069
here are your complimentary
monogrammed bag towels

02:32.152 --> 02:33.654
a sleeve of balls

02:33.737 --> 02:35.531
and this mobile
ball cleaner.

02:35.614 --> 02:40.118
( swooshing and squeaking
sounds )

02:40.202 --> 02:42.120
Clean as a whistle, sir!

02:42.204 --> 02:45.958
I'm not going to get short by
touching your spit, am I?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.960
You'd be the first, champ.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.461
Well, it's about time.

02:49.545 --> 02:53.257
Sorry, fellas, I'm not
going to be able to play.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.133
Loretta's mother
is in town

02:55.217 --> 02:58.428
and we have to go buy
new sheets for the dog bed.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.805
Cleveland!

02:59.888 --> 03:01.807
I mean the
pull-out sofa bed.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.350
Cleveland,
this is Barrington.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.144
You could be the first black guy
ever to play this course.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.479
People will be impressed.

03:07.563 --> 03:08.730
Hey, a black guy!
Ooh, fun!

03:08.814 --> 03:10.190
Come on, Cleveland.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.150
Maybe we should
play another time.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.569
Screw that.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.445
I busted my ass keeping Lois
busy so I could be here.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.947
Now let's grip it and rip it.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.740
The Fed is going to be
lowering rates

03:18.824 --> 03:20.701
so get your money out of T-bills

03:20.784 --> 03:22.703
and put it all into...
waffles, tasty waffles

03:22.786 --> 03:23.787
with lots of syrup.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.248
Waffles! Buy waffles!!

03:26.331 --> 03:28.584
All:
Waffles! Waffles!

03:34.423 --> 03:37.259
Okay, kids, keep your eyes
peeled for a clue.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.595
Now what Jughead
has done here--

03:39.678 --> 03:41.471
and it's really quite
ingenious, actually--

03:41.555 --> 03:44.892
is paint pupils on his eyelids
so he can sleep through class

03:44.975 --> 03:48.854
without Miss Grundy
being any the wiser.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.690
( cackles ):
He's sleeping!!

03:51.773 --> 03:53.567
Mom, I found
Dad's first clue.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.195
I can't believe your father
organized this.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.989
Usually, he can't even handle
simple tasks.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.784
Peter, why is there a diaper
in the lamp socket?

04:02.868 --> 04:04.786
Oh, Lois, he's done it again!

04:04.870 --> 04:06.288
Wait a minute.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.290
( electrical buzzing )

04:08.373 --> 04:09.374
Ha!

04:12.836 --> 04:14.004
Peter, let's pack it in.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.756
There's too much
water out here.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.424
Yeah, let's hit
the bar, huh?

04:17.508 --> 04:20.552
Oh, come on, there's worse
things in life than rain...

04:20.636 --> 04:22.054
like, eh... like spiders.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.097
Oh, he's behind the door...

04:24.181 --> 04:25.641
( coughing )

04:25.724 --> 04:27.267
Peter, he's bothering everyone.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.727
Say something.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.437
Say something.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.397
I'll kick his ass,
someone ought to kick his ass.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.233
Don't go in there!!

04:34.316 --> 04:35.567
Peter...

04:35.651 --> 04:37.152
All right,
give me a Kleenex.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.737
I knew he was bad!

04:38.820 --> 04:40.113
I knew...ahhhh!!

04:40.197 --> 04:43.200
Out of me way, they're after
me Lucky Charms!

04:43.283 --> 04:46.245
I paid him ten bucks
to say it.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.329
Classic.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.248
We'll be in the clubhouse.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.707
Go on, run away.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.876
More golf course
for me.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.214
That was close.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.465
Huh, that looks dangerous.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.300
Somebody's going to get hurt.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.723
Ah, it'll be fine.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.481
( gasps )

05:14.565 --> 05:15.983
Both:
You again?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.239
Oh, Death, please
don't take me now!

05:22.322 --> 05:23.574
Relax, you're not dying.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.534
You're just having
a near-death experience.

05:25.617 --> 05:26.869
Oh, thank God.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.662
Oh, yeah, thank God.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.790
Thank God I get to hang out
with a fascinating gent like yourself.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.876
So wh-when am I
going to die?

05:33.959 --> 05:36.170
About two years after
your wife divorces you.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.338
What the hell
are you talking about?

05:38.422 --> 05:39.715
Lois'd never leave me.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.634
She's been crazy about me
since the night we met.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.972
Oh, my God, that's me.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.391
Look how thin
I was!

05:49.474 --> 05:52.311
My, this is certainly
a beautiful night.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.104
I love looking at stars.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.480
Say no more.

05:55.564 --> 05:56.732
Peter, wait.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.319
"Very interesting...
but stupid!"

06:00.402 --> 06:01.904
( laughing )

06:01.987 --> 06:04.406
Oh, my God,
I love Arte Johnson!

06:04.489 --> 06:06.950
Then why don't you give him
a kiss, heh?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.869
Oh, Peter, get
away from me!

06:08.952 --> 06:10.579
Come on, come on.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.247
Stop it, stop it.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.636
Oh, my God!

06:25.719 --> 06:27.221
( tires screeching )

06:27.304 --> 06:30.140
( crashing )

06:30.224 --> 06:31.558
♪♪ Oh, baby, I love your way...♪

06:31.642 --> 06:33.268
Oh, Peter, I hear music.

06:33.352 --> 06:34.436
Yeah, me, too.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.731
From now on,
this'll be our song.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.650
( "Baby, I Love Your Way"
playing )

06:39.733 --> 06:41.318
( explosion )

06:41.401 --> 06:42.945
( groaning)

06:43.028 --> 06:45.197
I've never met a guy like you.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.324
You're so full of life.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.910
( wolves growling )

06:49.993 --> 06:51.245
( man screams )

06:51.328 --> 06:54.373
It's like I can really be myself
with you.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.832
I'm so happy.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.001
Ah, man, she was
beautiful.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.546
You know, this looks
awfully familiar...

07:00.629 --> 07:02.881
Wait a second, I remember this.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.383
That's me.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.051
Look at all
that hair.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.012
I can't believe I thought
that looked good.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.681
I must've been high.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.225
I love you, Lois Pewterschmidt.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.310
I love you, Peter Griffin.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.020
Look at that, huh, huh?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.314
There's no way
she's going to leave me.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.526
Now put me back in
my freakin' body, all right?

07:22.609 --> 07:25.153
I can't put you back
until you have a revelation.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.614
You know, one of those things
that changes your life.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.366
Oh, to hell with this,
I'm going home.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.617
What are you doing?

07:30.701 --> 07:31.910
You can't get
in that way.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.329
I'm sure as hell not
going in the back door.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.623
Oh, crap, I don't have time
for this.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.876
Listen,
I'm late for an appointment.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.253
You don't want to follow
procedure, fine.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.588
Stay here in limbo.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.339
No, no, no, wait.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.842
I don't want to be in limbo.

07:52.139 --> 07:56.310
Okay, it says the next note
will be right under my nose.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.394
( bell rings )

07:57.477 --> 07:58.562
Announcer:
And they're off.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.397
And quick out in front

08:00.480 --> 08:02.691
Silver Dasher,
followed by My Nose.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.359
Aha! Hold my purse!

08:08.947 --> 08:10.782
What's Mom doing?

08:10.866 --> 08:12.034
I'll tell you
what she's doing.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.077
She's screwing up my 6-2
quinella, damn it!

08:14.161 --> 08:16.538
My Nose out in front,
followed by Sea Biscuit

08:16.622 --> 08:18.373
followed by Some Crazy Lady

08:18.457 --> 08:20.375
followed by
Middle-Aged Housewife

08:20.459 --> 08:22.211
followed by Wait A Minute,
Who's That?

08:22.294 --> 08:23.795
followed by Silver Dasher.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.547
And now it appears there's
a woman chasing the dogs!

08:25.631 --> 08:27.799
( dogs barking )

08:29.384 --> 08:30.844
Let's go, kids!

08:30.928 --> 08:33.222
Lucky, tell the boys in
Kansas City the bet's off.

08:33.305 --> 08:34.681
Too late, Stewie.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.434
The fix is in and the noodles
are boiling in the pot--

08:37.518 --> 08:39.186
boiling, I tell you.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.605
Wait a minute, I got it, I got
it, I figured out my revelation.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.024
Uh, God loves
a working man.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.192
No!

08:45.275 --> 08:46.610
The Shadow is, in reality

08:46.693 --> 08:48.070
Lamont Cranston,
wealthy young man-about-town.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.738
No!

08:49.821 --> 08:52.324
Crap, I'm late;
I'm in big, big trouble.

08:52.407 --> 08:55.494
Geez, you're pretty shook up
about that appointment of yours.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.663
You're Death,
what are you afraid of?

08:57.746 --> 08:59.331
Where the hell
have you been?

08:59.414 --> 09:02.167
When I said lunch, I said noon,
not noon-ish.

09:02.251 --> 09:03.377
Sorry, Ma...

09:03.460 --> 09:04.962
Sorry!

09:05.045 --> 09:06.839
Is sorry going to
reheat the casserole?

09:06.922 --> 09:08.590
So who's your friend?

09:08.674 --> 09:10.968
It's a work thing, Ma,
near-death experience.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.135
Where are you going?

09:12.219 --> 09:13.262
I got to take a leak.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.430
Don't forget to zip up
your fly.

09:15.514 --> 09:19.184
If you don't zip up your fly,
a seagull will get you.

09:19.268 --> 09:23.188
God, she's a pain in the ass,
I wish Dad was still dead.

09:23.272 --> 09:26.441
Lois's dad was a pain in the ass
when I met him.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.611
( doorbell rings )

09:32.531 --> 09:34.908
Hi. Can I take my tie off yet?

09:34.992 --> 09:36.368
Oh, Peter,
you look so wonderful.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.787
You aren't nervous about
meeting Daddy, are you?

09:38.871 --> 09:40.497
Oh, you'll know
when I'm nervous.

09:40.581 --> 09:41.623
Father:
Lois!

09:41.707 --> 09:43.208
( passes gas ):
Now!

09:43.292 --> 09:45.210
Lois, take the
rap for this.

09:45.294 --> 09:48.213
I only get one chance
to make a first impression.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.673
( sniffs )

09:49.756 --> 09:52.801
Hi, Daddy, that was me,
and this is Peter.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.261
Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.138
What are you feeding
this gal?

09:56.221 --> 09:58.390
Peter Griffin. Can I take
this freakin' tie off?

09:58.473 --> 09:59.725
It's a pleasure, Peter.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.185
My daughter is quite taken
with you.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.603
And I'm taken with her.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.354
I mean, look at her.

10:04.438 --> 10:07.065
Show us front and
back there, Lois.

10:07.149 --> 10:10.235
And don't think I don't know
where that comes from.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.237
That's some world-class juice

10:12.321 --> 10:15.574
you got brewing in the old flesh
balloon down there, Carter?

10:15.657 --> 10:17.367
I'm going to get my purse.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.702
All right.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.913
Based on what you've seen
with your wife

10:20.996 --> 10:22.915
what can we expect
in terms of droopage here?

10:22.998 --> 10:24.499
Are we talking a slight slope

10:24.583 --> 10:25.751
or the full-blown
fried eggs

10:25.834 --> 10:27.085
hanging on a nail thing?

10:27.169 --> 10:28.253
Peter, what do you think of
this bronze statue?

10:28.337 --> 10:29.421
It's nice.

10:29.505 --> 10:30.547
It's early Etruscan.

10:30.631 --> 10:31.715
Oh, get out of here!

10:31.798 --> 10:32.966
No, seriously.
Oh, that's great.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.686
( sputtering and coughing )

10:46.313 --> 10:47.606
Hey, look, a manatee.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.233
We can use it for soup.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.031
Ensign Glen Quagmire;
welcome aboard.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.158
You picked a great day
to get rescued.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.702
We were just about to sing
a song about mopping.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.746
( breezy show music plays )

11:02.829 --> 11:05.666
♪♪ We're mopping the deck,
which is Navy for floor ♪♪

11:05.749 --> 11:09.419
♪♪ And when we're done mopping,
we'll mop it some more ♪♪

11:09.503 --> 11:12.297
♪♪ Swab means mop,
deck means floor... ♪♪

11:12.381 --> 11:15.300
Could you tell me when you're
leaving to go back in time?

11:15.384 --> 11:18.053
I was talking to a robe on
the coat rack for 20 minutes

11:18.136 --> 11:20.472
before I realized
you weren't in it.

11:20.556 --> 11:23.809
Ahh, for God's sake,
leave me alone, I'm working.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.435
Don't yell at your mother.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.104
If you yell at your mother

11:27.187 --> 11:29.273
a hen will lay eggs
in your tummy.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.358
Wow, brilliantly choreographed.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.110
That's your tax
dollars at work.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.153
Why don't you join us
and see the world?

11:35.237 --> 11:39.575
Sorry, pal, I've seen
the world, and its name is Lois.

11:39.658 --> 11:40.951
How romantic.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.036
Why can't you find a nice girl?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.830
Ma, she's going
to dump him.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.832
Well, at least he got that far.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.668
You know who he took to
the prom-- his cousin!

11:49.751 --> 11:51.086
That's weak.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.963
Yeah.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.591
All right, that's it,
I'm sick of both of you.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.342
Come on, Peter.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.678
Death, put your jacket on
or you'll get frostbite.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.096
I don't have skin.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.015
That's 'cause you didn't
eat your beans.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.895
Come on, come on, get back
in your big, fat body.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.980
Why should I help some guy
save his marriage

12:10.063 --> 12:12.274
when I can't even
get a girl?

12:12.357 --> 12:13.525
What are you saying?

12:13.609 --> 12:15.152
The revelation, jackass.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.654
It could've helped you
save your marriage.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.239
Oops, but too late.

12:19.323 --> 12:22.367
Oh, and, uh, by the way,
when the lightning hit you

12:22.451 --> 12:23.452
you soiled yourself.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.412
Enjoy.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.538
I can't lose Lois.

12:26.622 --> 12:27.706
I'll do anything.

12:27.789 --> 12:31.001
What if I helped you get a girl?

12:31.084 --> 12:34.046
Y-you think you
could do that?

12:34.129 --> 12:37.382
Sure, all we got to do is get
you a little fixed up, you know.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.426
Get your hair cut,
give you a good, clean...

12:39.510 --> 12:41.011
( screams )

12:41.094 --> 12:44.264
shave, maybe some cologne, the
chicks will be all over you.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.600
Gee, y-you really think so?

12:46.683 --> 12:47.976
Absolutely.

12:54.316 --> 12:55.359
You got any SPF-50?

12:55.442 --> 12:56.860
I bleach like
a gym sock.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.487
What? Death,
will you relax?

12:58.570 --> 13:01.406
I told you the beach is the perfect place
to pick up chicks.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.950
I want you
to go over there

13:03.033 --> 13:04.826
and ask those girls
if you can play.

13:04.910 --> 13:08.497
Uh... hey!
Can I join you?

13:08.580 --> 13:10.457
I guess.
What's your name?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.085
Josh.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.045
Do you, like, live
around here?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.089
No. I, uh...
I live with my mom.

13:18.257 --> 13:19.675
Let's get
out of here.

13:19.758 --> 13:20.759
See you, Josh.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.427
Tell your mom
we said hi.

13:22.511 --> 13:23.512
( giggling )

13:23.595 --> 13:24.680
Man:
Heads up!

13:26.932 --> 13:28.934
How do we get
up there?

13:29.017 --> 13:30.477
Dad put grease on the pole.

13:30.561 --> 13:31.854
Don't worry, Meg.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.772
We've been studying fulcrums
in school.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.899
You simply have
to counterbalance the weight

13:35.983 --> 13:37.776
at the point
where the lever pivots.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.194
Like so.

13:39.278 --> 13:42.072
Stewie, honey, you want
to play rocket ship?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.074
-What the deuce?
-Blast off!

13:44.157 --> 13:45.158
Go on, Stewie.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.910
Get the note
for Mommy.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.913
How dare you use me for your own
personal, selfish...

13:49.997 --> 13:52.124
Hmm... Whoo. Pull slower.

13:52.207 --> 13:55.335
I must remember to do this again
when no one's around.

13:55.419 --> 13:57.087
What the hell
was I thinking?

13:57.171 --> 13:59.423
You don't know anything
about picking up chicks.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.591
Are you kidding?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.009
I learned from the best.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.306
Come on, buddy. We're about
to anchor in Jamaica.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.141
Aw, Craig, we're getting closer
to Rhode Island.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.767
Rhode Island? Forget that.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.811
I'm taking off
for some shore leave.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.396
Does this look like
a "q" to you?

14:14.479 --> 14:16.064
-No.
-How about now?

14:16.148 --> 14:17.316
Sorry, Quagmire.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.860
Your crotch just looks like
Lois to me.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.403
Well, let's ask her, then.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.822
Hey, Lois, should Peter
sit around and mope all night?

14:25.574 --> 14:27.826
Or should Peter go out
with his buddy

14:27.910 --> 14:29.203
and have some fun?

14:29.286 --> 14:31.580
Huh, huh. All right.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.081
( music playing )

14:33.165 --> 14:35.375
Okay. That one's
a feminist type--

14:35.459 --> 14:38.504
she's into he-man--
and that one's mad for jazz.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.005
Watch this.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.758
The plight of women in this
hemisphere is deplorable.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.468
I can bench-press 800 pounds.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.762
You, me and Coltrane till dawn.
Giga-giga-gigadi!

14:46.845 --> 14:48.263
Huh. There you go, Peter.

14:48.347 --> 14:49.765
One for you, two for me.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.767
You guys go on without me.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.274
( sighs )

14:59.358 --> 15:01.235
So why didn't you go
with them?

15:01.318 --> 15:03.904
You don't know what it's like
when you're in love.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.364
Oh, yeah?
Her name's Amy.

15:05.447 --> 15:06.865
She works
at a pet store.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.576
I met her last summer
when her dad hung himself.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.411
But I was too shy
to ask her out.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.996
Aah, what's with
that mustache?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.540
Huh? Let me see that.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.500
Sorry. That's
Edward James Olmos.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.835
Here. This is her.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.545
Ah, nice ass.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.004
Oh, sorry. No, no.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.756
That's
Edward James Olmos's ass.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.633
I guess I don't have
a photo of her

15:24.716 --> 15:25.968
but trust me, she's cute.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.678
Well, let's go get her.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.389
I'm going to need that picture
of Olmos's ass back.

15:30.472 --> 15:31.473
Oh. Yeah, right.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.353
Mom, hurry!
I can't stand the smell.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.105
I found the note.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.983
"Go back to the Mini-mart"?

15:41.066 --> 15:43.026
Oh, this isn't very creative.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.486
Let's go, kids.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.405
Mom, you remember
that goldfish

15:46.488 --> 15:48.115
we flushed down
the toilet?

15:48.198 --> 15:49.575
He wasn't dead.

15:49.658 --> 15:50.659
( gun cocks )

15:50.742 --> 15:52.452
There she is.
That's her.

15:52.536 --> 15:53.620
All right now, go on.

15:53.704 --> 15:54.913
Just like we practiced.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.164
( inhales,
then exhale)

15:56.248 --> 15:57.749
Hey, you.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.127
Hi. I was, just, uh...

16:00.210 --> 16:01.628
( animals yelping )

16:01.712 --> 16:04.423
uh... and, and, uh, I was just

16:04.506 --> 16:06.758
in the neighborhood and, uh

16:06.842 --> 16:09.553
so I thought that, uh...

16:09.636 --> 16:11.388
so, uh, you...

16:11.471 --> 16:13.182
uh, I'll, uh...

16:13.265 --> 16:15.601
( louder ):
This is a bad time.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.896
Maybe I'll just come back.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.856
Who am I kidding?
I'll never get he.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.191
Not with that attitude.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.568
Come on! Robert Reed
got Florence Henderson

16:24.651 --> 16:27.279
and he was one of them
toe-tappin' burgermeisters.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.531
You've got to find a way
to make it happen.

16:29.615 --> 16:30.699
So long, Peter.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.326
I hope you find your girl.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.535
Thanks, Quagmire.

16:33.619 --> 16:35.829
Hope you live next
door to me someday.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.415
Hey... hey! Does this
look like a "q" to you?

16:38.498 --> 16:39.499
( woman screams )

16:39.583 --> 16:40.626
How about now?

16:45.464 --> 16:49.343
So, where is it that you need
to go, my new honky friend?

16:49.426 --> 16:51.929
Rhode Island.
That's not to far, is it?

16:52.012 --> 16:55.974
Nothing's too far away from
Maxine the cheatin' queen.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.977
Women. That's not fair.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.979
I'm just speaking
out of hurt.

17:04.983 --> 17:08.111
That truck's coming up
on us awful fast.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.780
( horn honking )

17:09.863 --> 17:11.198
Holy crap!

17:11.281 --> 17:12.533
Do you see what I see?

17:12.616 --> 17:13.659
I'm afraid I do.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.536
We're being chased by ghosts!

17:17.412 --> 17:20.415
So you went through all this
trouble just to see a girl?

17:20.499 --> 17:22.459
I just did, and I'm
just a fat idiot.

17:22.543 --> 17:24.419
What's your excuse,
you big chicken?

17:24.503 --> 17:26.046
Chicken?
You take that back.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.130
And make me.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.466
I don't make monkeys--
I train them.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.010
( both grunting and groaning)

17:32.094 --> 17:33.303
Holy crap!
I'm sorry.

17:33.387 --> 17:34.388
Did that hurt?

17:34.471 --> 17:35.806
No. But this will!

17:35.889 --> 17:37.474
Ah! Ah! You bastard!

17:37.558 --> 17:39.935
( yelling )

17:40.018 --> 17:41.478
What the hell is going on
out here?

17:41.562 --> 17:42.771
Um...

17:42.855 --> 17:44.523
Actually, I, uh...
I, uh...

17:44.606 --> 17:47.109
Actually, he wanted
to ask you something.

17:47.192 --> 17:50.070
Amy, you want to go somewhere
and grab a coffee?

17:50.153 --> 17:51.446
Sure. I get off at 2:00.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.948
Great. Uh, uh, Great.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.449
Uh, I'll meet you here.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.244
You did it!

17:57.327 --> 17:58.620
All right!

17:58.704 --> 18:01.164
Hey, who knows?
You might even, uh, you know?

18:04.543 --> 18:05.752
I'm not following you.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.212
-Intercourse.
-Ha.

18:08.714 --> 18:10.382
What are you
doing here?

18:10.465 --> 18:13.135
Loretta's mom
was hankering for a snack

18:13.218 --> 18:16.096
so we had to pick her up
some Kibbles 'n Bits.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.181
Cleveland!

18:17.264 --> 18:18.682
I mean Cheez-its.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.392
Did Peter give you
a clue for me?

18:20.475 --> 18:23.520
Peter? He's down at Barrington
with Brian and Quagmire.

18:23.604 --> 18:24.897
He's golfing?

18:24.980 --> 18:27.024
On our anniversary?

18:27.107 --> 18:29.985
Oh, boy. You just put
Peter in a doghouse

18:30.068 --> 18:32.321
which is where
your mother...

18:32.404 --> 18:33.739
Don't say it!

18:35.616 --> 18:36.909
Your mother smells.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.498
See? This is why I
hate clothes shopping.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.417
I have no ass.
I'm minus an ass.

18:45.501 --> 18:46.668
You're trying too hard, Death.

18:46.752 --> 18:49.004
She's not going to care
what you're wearing.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.756
She's just going to
be glad to see you.

18:50.839 --> 18:51.965
That's how it was with Lois.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.262
( growling )

18:57.346 --> 18:59.598
-( yells )
-( barking )

18:59.681 --> 19:01.892
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

19:01.975 --> 19:03.602
( barking ferociously )

19:06.313 --> 19:07.898
Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.900
What the hell
are you doing her?

19:09.983 --> 19:11.109
That's a long story

19:11.193 --> 19:12.528
with some
terrific performances

19:12.611 --> 19:14.196
and a wonderful scene
in a carnival

19:14.279 --> 19:15.697
but I'll cut to the ending.

19:15.781 --> 19:17.074
I want to marry Lois.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.659
Out of the question!

19:18.742 --> 19:21.328
Now, listen, Griffin,
I want you to take this

19:21.411 --> 19:23.914
and stay away from
my daughter forever.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.083
( gasps ):
A million dollars!

19:26.166 --> 19:27.292
A million dollars.

19:27.376 --> 19:28.502
No deal.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.712
Lois may be worth
a million to you

19:30.796 --> 19:32.798
but to me, she's worthless.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.550
I love her, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

19:34.633 --> 19:35.968
Oh, Peter!

19:38.178 --> 19:39.638
Holy crap!

19:39.721 --> 19:42.891
Back then, I gave up a million
bucks just to be with Lois.

19:42.975 --> 19:44.935
Now I won't even miss
a lousy golf game

19:45.018 --> 19:47.104
to spend our anniversary
together.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.689
No wonder she's
going to dump me.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.107
Or... is she?

19:50.190 --> 19:52.234
Wait a minute.
That's my revelation.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.361
I got to pay more attention
to my wife!

19:54.444 --> 19:55.863
Eureka.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.614
Now come on back
to the golf course.

19:57.698 --> 19:58.824
I've got a date.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.242
Death, wait, wait, wait.

20:00.325 --> 20:03.412
Before we go, I need you
to do me one more favor.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.582
Peter...

20:06.665 --> 20:09.209
Peter Frampton!

20:09.293 --> 20:10.711
Oh, no! God, please, no!

20:10.794 --> 20:12.629
I'm too young to die.

20:12.713 --> 20:16.508
Are you sure you're not supposed
to be at Keith Richards's house?

20:16.592 --> 20:20.721
All right. If you want to live,
come with me

20:20.804 --> 20:22.097
and bring your guitar

20:22.181 --> 20:24.558
and bring that thing
you use to make it go:

20:24.641 --> 20:26.894
♪♪ Wa, wa-wa-wa-wa-wa. ♪♪

20:28.312 --> 20:29.354
Hey!

20:29.438 --> 20:30.647
Hey!

20:30.731 --> 20:33.192
( tires squealing )

20:33.275 --> 20:36.695
How could he lie to me
on our anniversary?!

20:36.778 --> 20:38.238
( brakes screeching )

20:39.364 --> 20:41.033
( guitar playing softly )

20:41.116 --> 20:44.036
Frampton: ♪♪ Ooh, baby,
I love the way... ♪♪

20:44.119 --> 20:47.873
( music grows louder )

20:47.956 --> 20:50.584
♪♪ I wanna tell you
I love the way... ♪♪

20:55.506 --> 20:58.800
♪♪ I wanna be with you
night and day ♪♪

20:58.884 --> 21:01.386
Oh, Peter, our song!

21:01.470 --> 21:04.306
Happy anniversary, Lois!

21:04.389 --> 21:07.476
This is the most romantic gift
you've ever given me.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.103
How did you ever put
all of this together?

21:10.187 --> 21:12.147
Well, I had a little help

21:12.231 --> 21:14.525
from a very special friend.

21:14.608 --> 21:15.859
( song ends )

21:15.943 --> 21:18.070
I like animals.

21:18.153 --> 21:19.279
Uh-huh.

21:19.363 --> 21:20.864
'Cause they're
like people.

21:20.948 --> 21:22.574
Just little
furry people.

21:22.658 --> 21:25.702
Yeah. Uh, hey!
You ever go on the internet?

21:25.786 --> 21:29.164
They've got some cool stuff
there on that internet.

21:29.248 --> 21:30.874
Oh, yeah. I bought
these shoes

21:30.958 --> 21:32.334
from a company
on the internet

21:32.417 --> 21:34.169
because they don't
test on animals.

21:34.253 --> 21:36.463
Wow. ( sighs )

21:36.547 --> 21:39.049
You know, animals
never have wars.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.260
War is an invention
of mankind.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.595
What the hell
are you talking about?

21:43.679 --> 21:45.305
Animals fight all the time.

21:45.389 --> 21:47.057
Not with
nuclear arms.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.143
You can't hug your children
with nuclear arms.

21:51.937 --> 21:53.522
Check, please.
