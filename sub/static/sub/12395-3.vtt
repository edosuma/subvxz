WEBVTT

00:13.580 --> 00:16.378
- WHAT'S YOUR POISON?
- HUMANITY.

00:16.410 --> 00:17.638
- BAD DAY IN THE UNIVERSE, HUH?

00:17.680 --> 00:20.410
- EH. THEY ALL SORT
OF RUN TOGETHER.

00:20.450 --> 00:22.645
UNLESS A CORPSE RESURFACES
IN A BOGGY CREEK

00:22.690 --> 00:24.442
OR I LIQUIDATE SOME
NUT LOVING RODENTIA.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.149
OH! JACK DANIELS, ROCKS.

00:35.860 --> 00:37.566
- I'LL HAVE WHAT HE'S HAVING.

00:41.170 --> 00:46.107
I HOPE YOU WEREN'T SAVING
THIS STOOL FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:46.140 --> 00:48.279
- DO I KNOW YOU?

00:48.310 --> 00:49.777
OR DO YOU THINK
I'M SOMEONE ELSE?

00:49.810 --> 00:51.300
- TO THE NIGHT.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.411
SO WHAT'S YOUR STORY,
CARLTON?

00:57.450 --> 00:58.815
- HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.454
- I ASKED YOU FIRST.

01:00.490 --> 01:02.048
- ARE YOU A PROSTITUTE?

01:04.860 --> 01:07.294
- IS THAT THE VIBE
I'M GIVING OFF?

01:07.330 --> 01:11.790
I'M SORRY, NO. I'M JUST...
I DON'T KNOW, JUST A LITTLE...

01:11.830 --> 01:13.695
- LONELY?

01:13.740 --> 01:16.504
- YEAH, MAYBE.
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

01:16.540 --> 01:19.338
SO YOU GONNA TELL ME
ABOUT YOURSELF OR NOT?

01:19.380 --> 01:20.506
- YEP.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.439
WELL, YOU ALREADY KNOW MY NAME.

01:24.480 --> 01:28.371
I COME HERE TO UNWIND,
'CAUSE MY JOB CAN BE INTENSE.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.115
I OFTEN DREAM
I'M CLINT EASTWOOD.

01:30.150 --> 01:31.549
- EVEN IN BLOODWORK?

01:31.590 --> 01:33.478
- MOSTLY HEARTBREAK RIDGE.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.488
- PLEASE CONTINUE.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.181
- I AM SOMEWHAT
RECENTLY DIVORCED,

01:37.230 --> 01:38.857
I BELIEVE THERE IS LITI'LE T0
N0 ROOM FOR INTERPRETATION

01:38.890 --> 01:40.596
WHEN IT COMES TO
THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION,

01:40.630 --> 01:43.121
AND I HAVE AN UNUSUALLY
HIGH THRESHOLD FOR PAIN.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.422
THAT IS A FAIRLY
UNUSUAL NECKLACE

01:45.470 --> 01:48.359
AND IT SHOWS OFF
YOUR CLAVICLE QUITE WELL.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.709
- FOR ALL ETERNITY

01:50.740 --> 01:53.436
- YOUR TURN.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.849
- OKAY. I'M ABOUT
AS SINGLE AS THEY COME,

01:57.880 --> 02:00.610
AND I REALLY LIKE A MAN
WITH HAIR ON HIS CHEST.

02:00.650 --> 02:04.882
AND AS FOR CLINT, I REALLY
THINK IT'S UNFORGIVEN.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.616
YOUR EYES ARE SWIMMABLE.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.389
WHY IS YOUR JOB SO INTENSE?

02:09.430 --> 02:11.819
- HOW DID YOU KNOW MY NAME?

02:11.860 --> 02:15.398
- WHY DON'T YOU HOLD THAT
THOUGHT WHILE I GO FRESHEN UP?

02:15.430 --> 02:17.261
WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE WHISKEY.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.830
- MAYBE SHE'S ON THE PHONE.
YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?

02:28.880 --> 02:30.279
- MAYBE SHE'S WITH A GUY.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.515
- HEY! YOU BLIND, FLAT STANLEY?

02:37.550 --> 02:39.757
- GET.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.458
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.590
[screaming]

04:03.370 --> 04:05.600
- LISTEN, JULES, JUST DON'T
BEAT YOURSELF UP.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.676
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BE
EXPECTED TO CONTROL

04:07.710 --> 04:09.371
WHETHER OR NOT GUS AND I,

04:09.410 --> 04:10.445
SURREPTITIOUSLY FOLLOW
YOU AFTER YOU GET

04:10.480 --> 04:12.038
A CALL DURING BREAKFAST.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.672
- BUT, I SPECIFICALLY
TOLD YOU NOT TO FOLLOW.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.778
- SHE SAID FARROW.

04:14.820 --> 04:15.878
- FARROW IS NOT A WORD.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.547
I SAID FOLLOW,
HE KNOWS I SAID FOLLOW.

04:17.590 --> 04:20.354
- I WASN'T THERE BUT, FARROW IS
MOST DEFINITELY A WORD.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.414
- THANK YOU.

04:21.460 --> 04:23.348
- IT MEANS TO BIRTH
A CALF OR A LI'I'I'ER OF PIGS.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.756
- OKAY, FINE. WHY WOULD
I TELL SHAWN NOT TO BIRTH

04:25.790 --> 04:27.724
A CALF OR A LITTER OF PIGS?

04:27.760 --> 04:28.897
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:28.930 --> 04:30.022
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

04:30.070 --> 04:31.560
- MALE, EARLY 3OS.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.033
NOW CSI IS ON THEIR WAY,
BUT I'D SAY--

04:33.070 --> 04:34.662
- THE GIRL, MCNAB.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.702
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT
THE GIRL I MET LAST NIGHT?

04:36.740 --> 04:39.538
- OH. I MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BIT
MORE TO GO ON, SIR.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.536
- WHAT DO YOU NEED?
WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED?

04:41.580 --> 04:43.502
I TOLD YOU SHE'S BLONDE

04:43.550 --> 04:45.370
AND PALE AND PERFECT
AND BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.742
SO, GET ME A NAME AND
GET ME AN ADDRESS,

04:47.780 --> 04:50.340
AND GET ME SOME ASPIRIN.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.312
PLEASE TELL ME WHY
THEY'RE AT MY CRIME SCENE?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.987
- LASSIE, IT'S NOT JULES' FAULT.

04:54.020 --> 04:55.214
SHE TOLD ME NOT TO FOLLOW HER,

04:55.260 --> 04:59.082
I THOUGHT SHE WAS TELLING ME
NOT TO BE PREGNANT WITH SWINE.

04:59.130 --> 05:01.394
- GO.

05:01.430 --> 05:02.624
- ARE YOU OKAY?

05:02.670 --> 05:04.422
I HAVEN'T BEAT YOU
TO A CALL IN SIX YEARS.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.664
- OF COURSE I'M OKAY.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.089
WHY WOULDN'T I BE OKAY?
I HAD TO STOP FOR GAS.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.108
ALL RIGHT,

05:13.940 --> 05:16.079
NAME OF THE DECEASED
IS HAMILTON DEANE,

05:16.110 --> 05:20.342
LIVES DOWNTOWN,
ABOUT A HUNDRED BUCKS IN CASH,

05:20.380 --> 05:22.041
CREDIT CARDS, AAA.
I'M GOING TO ROLL HIM.

05:24.890 --> 05:27.450
THIS ABRASION ON HIS NECK?

05:28.760 --> 05:30.387
- THAT DUDE IS AWFULLY PALE

05:30.430 --> 05:32.421
ABNORMALLY PALE.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.893
ESPECIALLY SINCE
HE'S ONLY BEEN DEAD FOR--

05:33.930 --> 05:35.693
- CHECK THE NECK.
CHECK THE WRISTS.

05:35.730 --> 05:36.924
- WHAT'S THIS?

05:36.970 --> 05:40.098
LOOKS LIKE OUR KILLER MIGHT
HAVE LEFT US A LITTLE PRESENT.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.732
- WHAT A SHAME.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.635
- THAT IS A VERY USUAL NECKLACE

05:45.670 --> 05:47.729
AND IT SHOWS OFF
YOUR CLAVICLE QUITE WELL.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.146
- FOR ALL ETERNITY.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.045
- GUS, NO BLOOD, PUNCTURE MARKS.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.014
- ABNORMALLY PALE!
WHAT?! DO IT.

05:54.050 --> 05:55.074
- OKAY.
- DO IT.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.439
- OKAY.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.548
- BETTER YET,
LET ME DO IT. I'LL DO IT.

05:57.590 --> 05:58.784
- SETTLE DOWN.
YOU'RE NOT DOING IT.

05:58.820 --> 06:00.458
I WISH I HAD A BIGGER AUDIENCE.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.582
- DO IT.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.053
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

06:03.090 --> 06:05.456
I MUST ASK YOU TO
BRACE YOURSELVES.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.050
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO EXPUNGE
IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.

06:08.100 --> 06:11.126
IT IS BOLD WITH A ZESTY,
SALTY FINISH.

06:11.170 --> 06:14.037
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST
HERE IS NO MERE MORTAL.

06:14.070 --> 06:18.860
I'M AFRAID THIS VERY WELL
MAYBE THE WORK OF A VAMPIRE.

06:18.910 --> 06:21.708
- SOOKIE...IS MINE!!

06:28.180 --> 06:30.489
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING PARTNER?

06:30.520 --> 06:32.579
- ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO GO WITH SPENCER ON THIS ONE.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.151
[indie rock music]

06:39.190 --> 06:42.819
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW,
THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

06:42.870 --> 06:46.021
* I KNOW YOU KNOW,
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

06:46.070 --> 06:49.164
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION,
LEARN HOW TO BEND *

06:49.200 --> 06:53.500
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS TEND
TO PSYCH YOU OUT IN THE END *

07:05.190 --> 07:06.612
- YOU KNOW YOU WEREN'T
NEARLY THIS PUMPED

07:06.660 --> 07:07.911
WHEN YOU THOUGHT WE WERE
CHASING A WEREWOLF.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.757
- I'M NOT TRYING TO GET
DEVOURED BY A HAIRY,

07:09.790 --> 07:12.452
FAMISHED BEAST, SHAWN,
BUT I WILL WHIP ME SOME LITHE,

07:12.500 --> 07:13.797
WISPY VAMPIRE ASS.

07:13.830 --> 07:16.196
- ALL RIGHT,
AND YOU WREAK OF GARLIC.

07:16.230 --> 07:18.164
YOU LOOK LIKE OMAR EPPS
FROM DRACULA 2000.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.088
- I'LL TAKE IT.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.493
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S ODD

07:21.540 --> 07:23.098
THAT LASSIE JUMPED ON
OUR VAMPIRE WAGON?

07:23.140 --> 07:25.062
- YOU KNOW I HAVE LONG
SINCE DREAMT OF LASSIE

07:25.110 --> 07:27.078
JUMPING ONBOARD WITH
ONE OF MY NUTTY THEORIES,

07:27.110 --> 07:28.099
BUT NOW THAT HE'S
ACTUALLY DONE IT,

07:28.140 --> 07:29.846
I DON'T KNOW WHY I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE SO COOL,

07:29.880 --> 07:31.108
IT DOES FEEL ODD.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.572
- IT'S LIKE THE ROADRUNNER
STOPPING AND SAYING,

07:32.620 --> 07:33.678
"YOU KNOW WHAT, WILE E.?

07:33.720 --> 07:34.618
YOU'VE EARNED THIS.
BLOW ME UP. "

07:34.650 --> 07:37.039
- YOU SAYING THE COYOTE
HAS A FIRST NAME?

07:37.090 --> 07:38.182
- YEAH.

07:38.220 --> 07:39.517
- IT'S NOT, O-S-C-A-R?

07:39.560 --> 07:40.982
- THAT'S BOLOGNA.
- YOU'RE BOLOGNA

07:41.020 --> 07:42.521
- NECRO BUTCHER!

07:42.560 --> 07:44.949
- RYAN PHILLIPE!

07:44.990 --> 07:46.924
- WE'RE TRYING OUT PET NAMES.
YOURS IS BOLOGNA.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.689
- CAN WE GET STARTED PLEASE?

07:48.730 --> 07:52.120
- OF COURSE.
FOR YOU, MY LADY.

07:52.170 --> 07:54.593
- AW, WHAT IS IT?
- SMALL INTESTINE OF A RAM.

07:56.970 --> 07:58.608
- CAUSE OF DEATH?

07:58.640 --> 08:00.528
- PULMONARY FAILURE
OR SEVERE BLOOD LOSS.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.207
WHICHEVER CAME FIRST.
- HOW SEVERE?

08:02.240 --> 08:03.309
- HIS TANK'S JUST
ABOUT ON EMPTY.

08:03.350 --> 08:06.615
A BIT OF TRIVIA, THE HUMAN BODY
WHEN DRAINED OF MOST

08:06.650 --> 08:09.016
ITS BLOOD WILL OFTEN
TIMES STOP WORKING.

08:09.050 --> 08:11.280
NOTE THE PUNCTURE
WOUNDS ON THE NECK THERE

08:11.320 --> 08:13.857
AND ON THE WRISTS HERE AND HERE.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.881
- WOODY, IN YOUR
PROFESSIONAL OPINION,

08:15.920 --> 08:17.126
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
THIS POOR MAN

08:17.160 --> 08:19.549
WAS THE VICTIM OF
A VAMPIRE ATTACK?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.955
- DON'T DIGNIFY THAT
WITH A RESPONSE.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.524
- WASN'T PLANNING ON IT.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.219
- IS IT POSSIBLE?
- MOST LIKELY, YES.

08:25.270 --> 08:26.567
- WOODY?!
- IT'S A GIVEN REALLY.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.965
- ALL RIGHT PEOPLE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.809
I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS
WE'RE AFTER A VAMPIRE

08:29.840 --> 08:31.728
WHO'S OUT THERE DOING
STUFF THAT VAM PIRES DO.

08:31.770 --> 08:33.101
SO, GET ON THIS AND
FIND ME A LEAD.

08:33.140 --> 08:34.539
- CARLTON, HAVE YOU
LOST YOUR MIND?

08:34.580 --> 08:36.571
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

08:36.610 --> 08:38.942
- I HAVE A PERSONAL MATTER
TO ATTEND TO, I'LL CATCH UP.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.845
- SINCE WHEN DO YOU HAVE
PERSONAL MATTERS?

08:43.290 --> 08:46.009
OKAY, MY PARTNER HAS
GONE OFF THE RESERVATION.

08:46.050 --> 08:47.950
I HOPE THAT YOU ARE
ALL VERY HAPPY.

08:47.990 --> 08:50.629
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO CATCH A MURDERER

08:50.660 --> 08:54.596
AND I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN
THAT HE OR SHE IS HUMAN.

08:54.630 --> 08:56.689
- WELL, THERE GOES MY NIGHT.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.974
- THIS NECKLACE LOOK
FAMILIAR TO YOU?

09:08.010 --> 09:10.103
- HEY, WE USED
TO SELL THIS PIECE.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.879
- HEY, NO KIDDING?

09:11.910 --> 09:13.616
I'M GONNA NEED
A RECORD OF EVERYONE

09:13.650 --> 09:14.912
WHO'S PURCHASED THIS
THING IN THE LAST OH,

09:14.950 --> 09:16.588
I DON'T KNOW,
LET'S JUST SAY EVER.

09:16.620 --> 09:19.885
- OH, MAN, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
- COME AGAIN?

09:19.920 --> 09:21.956
- WELL IT'S JUST THIS PIECE,
WE ONLY HAD A FEW OF THEM,

09:21.990 --> 09:23.082
AND IT WAS YEARS AGO.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.358
- HOW MANY YEARS AGO?

09:24.390 --> 09:25.857
- THREE OR FOUR MAYBE.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.699
WE DON'T REALLY KEEP
RECORDS OF THAT KINDA STUFF.

09:27.730 --> 09:32.838
I MEAN, LOOK AROUND.
WE'RE NOT ZALES OR JARED'S.

09:32.870 --> 09:35.759
- OKAY, I DON'T SUPPOSE
THAT YOU WOULD REMEMBER

09:35.800 --> 09:37.700
WHO MADE THESE
PURCHASES WOULD YOU?

09:37.740 --> 09:39.560
- DUDES. CHICKS.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.875
NO, NO, NOT REALLY, NO.

09:43.910 --> 09:45.309
- JUST FORGET IT.

09:45.350 --> 09:47.739
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
A PLACE CALLED BLING CROSBY

09:47.780 --> 09:49.782
WOULD BE A DEAD END.
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.

09:49.820 --> 09:52.038
- SORRY, MAN.

09:52.090 --> 09:53.887
THAT'S A KILLER WATCH
YOU HAVE THOUGH.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.184
YOU WANT TO SELL IT FOR
WAY LESS THAN IT'S WORTH?

09:56.220 --> 09:59.690
- THIS OLD THING JUST KEEPS
ON TICKING LIKE THE HEART

09:59.730 --> 10:03.325
OF A WOUNDED ELEPHANT
JUST GRIZZLED AND...

10:03.370 --> 10:06.635
- WHY DON'T YOU HOLD THAT
THOUGHT WHILE I GO FRESHEN UP?

10:13.080 --> 10:14.377
- I'LL BE DAMNED.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.644
- THIS IS NOT FUNNY SHAWN.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.739
I'M THE ONLY SANE PERSON
WORKING THIS CASE

10:21.780 --> 10:23.839
AND THAT MAKES MY TIME
EVEN MORE VALUABLE.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.039
DO YOU KNOW HAVE ANY
IDEA HOW LONG IT TOOK

10:25.090 --> 10:26.682
ME TO FIND THIS
RIDICULOUS PLACE?

10:26.720 --> 10:29.689
IT DOESN'T HAVE AN ADDRESS.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.254
HELLO, SHAWN.

10:36.430 --> 10:39.263
- "I CAN'T HELP BEING
A GORGEOUS FIEND.

10:39.300 --> 10:42.189
IT'S JUST THE CARD I DREW."

10:42.240 --> 10:44.902
- WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU WEARING?

10:47.740 --> 10:49.674
- WE'RE ON THEIR TURF JULIET.

10:49.710 --> 10:52.144
WE HAVE TO WALK THE WALK
OF A TRUE NIGHT STALKER.

10:52.180 --> 10:53.943
- NIGHT STALKER?
- HE'S RIGHT. LOOK AROUND,

10:53.980 --> 10:56.244
YOU'RE THE FISH
OUT OF WATER HERE.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.009
- BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL
PRETENDING TO BE DEAD, SHAWN.

10:58.050 --> 11:00.814
- WELL, PERHAPS IT IS US
WHO PRETEND TO BE ALIVE.

11:02.420 --> 11:06.857
- GREETINGS BROTHER.
THREE VIRGIN SLOW GIN FIZZES.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.788
- MAKE 'EM BLOODY MARYS

11:08.830 --> 11:11.162
AND WHATEVER SNACK MIX
YOU CAN WHIP UP OVER THERE.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.461
- I WILL GLADLY SERVE
THE TWO OF YOU,

11:17.510 --> 11:21.401
HOWEVER THE HUMAN IS NOT
GOING TO GET A DRINK FROM ME.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.375
YOU HAVE BROKEN THE
CARDINAL LAW BY ALLOWING

11:24.410 --> 11:26.970
A DAY WALKER TO ENTER OUR REALM.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.772
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.

11:28.820 --> 11:31.948
DETECTIVE O'HARA, SBPD.
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.959
- WHOA! HEY, OKAY,
SLOW IT DOWN THERE, CAGNEY.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.049
JUST A REGULAR GUY
HERE, OKAY,

11:37.090 --> 11:38.387
TRYING TO MAKE A DOLLAR,
THAT'S IT.

11:38.430 --> 11:40.091
I PLAY UP THIS WHOLE
CHARACTER THING

11:40.130 --> 11:42.826
TO GET SOME MONEY
OUT OF THESE FREAKS.

11:42.870 --> 11:43.825
- CHARLATAN!

11:43.870 --> 11:46.361
- WHO'S TALKING?
COUNT CHOCULA OVER HERE, PLEASE.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.891
- COUNT CHOCULA? YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND!

11:48.940 --> 11:50.134
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU,

11:51.440 --> 11:53.032
EXCEPT FOR US
AND QUENTIN TARANTINO.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.379
LOOK,
WE'RE JUST WONDERING IF--

11:56.410 --> 11:58.799
IF YOU THINK ANY OF YOUR
CUSTOMERS HERE ARE DANGEROUS

11:58.850 --> 12:02.513
OR CAPABLE OF
ATTACKING SOMEONE AND

12:03.890 --> 12:05.141
- YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

12:05.190 --> 12:07.181
DUDE, THIS IS
SANTA BARBARA OKAY.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.223
ALL THE PEOPLE HERE ARE LIKE
FASHIONISTAS AND SLAM POETS.

12:10.260 --> 12:11.488
- I'M LEAVING NOW.

12:11.530 --> 12:14.158
- OH, WAIT! I DO HAVE
ONE LITTLE PIECE OF INFO

12:14.200 --> 12:16.054
YOU MIGHT FIND INTERESTING.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.193
I GOT A CALL LAST WEEK,
I BELIEVE ON WEDNESDAY,

12:18.230 --> 12:20.266
AND IT WAS A CUSTOMER
WHO WAS ASKING

12:20.300 --> 12:25.033
IF I WOULD SELL THEM A PINT
OF REAL BLOOD. WEIRD.

12:25.070 --> 12:26.901
- DID YOU RECOGNIZE THE VOICE?

12:26.940 --> 12:28.339
- NO, CAN'T SAY I DID.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.870
- YOU REMEMBER WHEN THEY CALLED?

12:29.910 --> 12:31.775
- YES, AS A MATTER FACT,
IT WAS AT 1:30.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.471
IT WAS EXACTLY
1:30 ON WEDNESDAY,

12:33.520 --> 12:35.215
BECAUSE I WAS WATCHING OPRAH

12:35.250 --> 12:36.342
AND IT WAS RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF--

12:36.380 --> 12:37.540
WHAT'S THAT THIS GUY, NATE...

12:37.590 --> 12:38.887
- BERKUS.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.251
- BERKUS! LOVE THAT GUY!

12:40.290 --> 12:44.158
HE WAS REFURBISHING
A CHIPPENDALE, AMAZING STUFF.

12:44.190 --> 12:45.259
- CALLER ID.

12:45.290 --> 12:46.826
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DO THE HONORS?

12:46.860 --> 12:48.259
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO SEE THAT PHONE.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.266
- MARLOWE VICCELLIO.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.825
- HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

13:35.010 --> 13:36.238
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

13:36.280 --> 13:39.545
- YOU DON'T LIVE ALONE.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.241
- NO, IT'S ME AND THREE GUYS.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.417
- HAVE YOU EVER DATED,
THOUGHT ABOUT DATING

13:42.450 --> 13:43.542
OR HAVE ANY CASUAL RELATIONS

13:43.590 --> 13:44.909
WITH TH ESE
FREELOADING PARASITES?

13:44.950 --> 13:48.010
- NO. IS THIS AN INTERROGATION?

13:48.060 --> 13:50.426
- BELIEVE ME,
I WISH IT WEREN'T.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.087
WHERE'S THE NECKLACE?

13:52.130 --> 13:53.449
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.025
- "FOR ALL ETERNITY."
THE NECKLACE.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.893
- WELL, I DIDN'T SLEEP IN IT.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.636
- SHOW IT TO ME.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.400
- OKAY, FOLLOW ME.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.979
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
ALREADY IN MY BEDROOM.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.050
YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT, DETECTIVE?

14:24.090 --> 14:25.489
- OKAY, ONE MORE THING
AND I PROMISE

14:25.530 --> 14:27.327
WE'LL BE ABLE TO
LAUGH ABOUT THIS.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.497
I NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED

14:28.530 --> 14:30.862
AFTER YOU LEFT LAST NIGHT.

14:32.470 --> 14:33.494
- I WENT OUT THE BATHROOM WINDOW

14:33.540 --> 14:36.168
AND I RAN ACROSS THE STREET
AND I SAT IN MY CAR

14:36.200 --> 14:39.931
AND I WATCHED YOU WAIT FOR ME.

14:41.980 --> 14:44.369
YOU GOT INTO A FIGHT
WITH THE BARTENDER

14:44.410 --> 14:46.549
AND THEN YOU FINISHED YOUR DRINK

14:46.580 --> 14:49.378
AND YOU WENT TO BACK AND
EVENTUALLY YOU WENT OUTSIDE

14:49.420 --> 14:53.516
AND EXCHANGED HEATED
WORDS WITH A HOMELESS MAN.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.482
YOU LOOKED REALLY SAD.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.488
I JUST LET YOU WALK AWAY.

15:01.630 --> 15:03.097
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

15:03.130 --> 15:06.520
- I JUST--
IT'S BEEN TOUGH FOR ME LATELY.

15:06.570 --> 15:11.360
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD MUCH LUCK.
I FELT SOMETHING.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.434
- SO DID I.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.501
THE ONLY THING IT COMPARES
TO IS THE RUSH OF JUBILATION

15:16.540 --> 15:18.576
I FELT WHEN I HEARD CHUCK
NORRIS SPEAK AT AN N.R.A.

15:18.610 --> 15:21.374
CONVENTION IN ABERDEEN.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.514
I WAS THIRTEEN.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.518
- I JUST GOT SCARED.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.487
I'M SORRY.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.198
[loud knocking]

15:34.230 --> 15:37.290
- MARLOWE VICCELLIO!
THIS IS THE POLICE!

15:37.330 --> 15:39.628
[crash]

15:39.670 --> 15:44.232
HOLD ON, GUYS.
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING YET.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.534
CARLTON, WHAT'S GONG ON HERE?

15:54.150 --> 15:57.142
- CARLTON, WHAT EXACTLY
IS GOING ON HERE?

15:57.190 --> 15:59.613
- I SUPPOSE I DO OWE YOU
AN EXPLANATION, PARTNER.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.208
I OWE YOU TWO NOTHING
AND YOU LOOK LIKE

16:01.260 --> 16:03.683
A COUPLE OF ASS HATS IN
THOSE RIDICULOUS COSTUMES.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.688
- I'M DANGEROUS IN A SEXY WAY.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.197
- MORE LIKE A GAY WAY.

16:08.230 --> 16:09.993
- WELL, I'M STRAIGHT-UP ICONIC.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.622
- I WOULDN'T CALL
COUNT CHOCULA AN ICON.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.331
- I'M BLACULA!

16:13.370 --> 16:15.133
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE
UNDER ARREST YOU SUCCUBUS.

16:15.170 --> 16:16.330
- HOLD ON.

16:16.370 --> 16:18.304
THERE'S IS NO WAY SHE COULD
HAVE COMMITTED THIS MURDER,

16:18.340 --> 16:20.501
SHE HAS AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI.

16:20.540 --> 16:23.202
- CARLTON, SOMEBODY
CALLED A VAMPIRE BAR

16:23.250 --> 16:24.478
ASKING TO BUY A LOT OF BLOOD.

16:24.510 --> 16:25.647
WE TRACED THE CALL,

16:25.680 --> 16:27.238
AND IT CAME FROM
INSIDE THIS HOUSE.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.679
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

16:28.720 --> 16:31.086
- SURE.
I HAVE THREE ROOMMATES

16:31.120 --> 16:32.439
AND THEY'RE A QUIRKY
GROUP OF GUYS,

16:32.490 --> 16:34.378
SO I WOULDN'T PUT
IT PAST ANY OF THEM

16:34.420 --> 16:35.785
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.027
- YOU LIVE WITH TWO DUDE
AND MARIO LOPEZ.

16:38.060 --> 16:39.755
- OH, BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE
CARNAL KNOWLEDGE OF ANY OF THEM.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.394
- WHAT'S THIS AIRTIGHT ALIBI?

16:41.430 --> 16:44.228
- GO AHEAD.
YOU CAN TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.236
- I WAS WITH CARLTON IN A BAR

16:47.270 --> 16:49.761
AND SNUCK AWAY TO
MY CAR TO WATCH HIM,

16:49.800 --> 16:53.236
BECAUSE I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT
THE LEVEL OF ATTRACTION

16:53.280 --> 16:57.774
I IMMEDIATELY FELT FOR HIM BOTH
EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY.

16:57.810 --> 17:00.313
- NO, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT'S THE ALIBI?

17:00.350 --> 17:03.080
- SHE RECOUNTED MY EVERY MOVE
AS I SAT STOIC AT THE BAR.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.111
THERE IS NO WAY SHE COULD HAVE
BEEN IN TWO PLACES AT ONE TIME.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.742
- YOU REALIZE BY
CORROBORATING HER STORY?

17:06.790 --> 17:10.089
- YES, O'HARA.
IT MEANS I'M HER ALIBI.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.655
AND NEEDLESS TO SAY, I DON'T
BELIEVE IN VAMPIRES.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.351
- YOU WILL WHEN SHE BITES YOU.

17:14.400 --> 17:19.793
- BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LOVE YOU
ENOUGH "NOT TO CONDEMN YOU."

17:19.830 --> 17:21.593
- YOU WATCH THAT
HAIRY EYEBALL SPENCER,

17:21.640 --> 17:23.369
THIS LADY'S BEEN THROUGH
ENOUGH.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.604
- MARLOWE, WE'RE GOING
TO NEED TO TALK

17:24.640 --> 17:26.733
TO EACH OF YOUR ROOMMATES AND
FIND OUT WHO MADE THAT CALL.

17:26.770 --> 17:29.739
- YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S EDDIE, JAKE AND LUCIEN.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.340
- WHERE IS THE LUCIEN?

17:33.380 --> 17:35.416
- SO, ANY FOOD ALLERGIES
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

17:35.450 --> 17:38.487
BEFORE I DAZZLE YOU
WITH DINNER?

17:38.520 --> 17:39.748
NUTS, WHAT KIND OF NUTS?
ALL NUTS?

17:39.790 --> 17:42.850
JUST FILBERTS, CHECK.

17:42.890 --> 17:46.053
- LUCIEN, OUR SUSPECT,
IS IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM.

17:47.730 --> 17:50.164
- OH, OH. THERE WILL BE DESSERT.

18:06.310 --> 18:10.110
- DUDE, NO DICE, IT NEEDS TO BE
GARLIC TO SKIN CONTACT SHAWN.

18:24.430 --> 18:26.159
- ARE YOU SURE
THIS WATER IS HOLY?

18:26.200 --> 18:28.498
- YES, I HAD FATHER WESLEY
BLESS IT OVER THE PHONE.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.167
- OVER THE PHONE.
- YES.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.131
- I DON'T THINK IT
WORKS LIKE THAT.

18:31.170 --> 18:36.574
- YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
ANYTHING WORKS, SHAWN.

18:36.610 --> 18:41.343
- SO, LUCIEN, WHERE WERE YOU
BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 10:00 PM

18:41.380 --> 18:42.847
AND 11:00 PM
ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT?

18:42.880 --> 18:45.189
- AND THE YEAR 1540.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.539
- WHAT?

18:46.590 --> 18:48.785
- TAKE IT, CREATURE.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.356
- GUYS, ENOUGH.

18:52.230 --> 18:54.198
- MAN, I DON'T THINK
THIS IS SLIVER.

18:54.230 --> 18:55.697
- I PAID FOR SILVER.
- WELL, YOU GOT HOSED.

18:55.730 --> 18:57.721
- WOW! YOU GUYS
ARE ACTUALLY DEVOLVING.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.795
GET BACK OVER HERE. NOW!

19:02.540 --> 19:03.564
REALLY.

19:06.670 --> 19:07.773
ANSWER THE QUESTION, LUCIEN.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.748
- I WAS WORKING MY SHIFT
AT KING PUTT MINI-GOLF.

19:11.780 --> 19:12.906
THERE WAS A LATE RUSH,

19:12.950 --> 19:14.474
AND I CLOSED
THE COURSE THAT NIGHT.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.509
- HOLD UP.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.716
WILL KING PUTT HONOR AN EXPIRED,

19:21.760 --> 19:23.352
TWO FOR-ONE GROUPON?
YES OR NO.

19:23.390 --> 19:24.948
- SHAWN, THIS IS SERIOUS.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.753
LISTEN, ON THE THIRD HOLE,

19:26.790 --> 19:27.950
I USUALLY PUTT UP
THE RIGHT SIDE,

19:28.000 --> 19:29.149
BANK THROUGH THE
RUBBER BUMPERS,

19:29.200 --> 19:32.397
BUT I STILL KEEP GETTING NAILED
BY THE SWINGING MAMMARIES.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.897
- THOSE AREN'T MAMMARIES.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.659
THEY'RE THE BELLS ON
THE END OF A JESTER'S CAP.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.906
both: REALLY?

19:37.940 --> 19:39.703
- YES, IT'S PUTT-PUTT FOR KIDS.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.805
- LUCIEN, WE'LL NEED
TO VERIFY YOUR ALIBI

19:45.850 --> 19:47.511
WITH THE MANAGEMENT
AT KING PUTT.

19:47.550 --> 19:49.438
- FINE, HIS NAME IS WAYNE.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.929
- I'M NOT BUYING THIS.
I CAN SEE YOUR BEDROOM, MAN,

19:58.960 --> 20:01.520
WITH THE CRACKED MIRROR
AND THE KITTY LITTER.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.221
- GIVE IT UP, SHAPE SHIFTER!

20:03.270 --> 20:04.897
- I DON'T HAVE A BEDROOM.

20:04.930 --> 20:07.933
I LIVE IN THE TENT OUT BACK.
YOU SHOULD BE TALKING TO ED.

20:07.970 --> 20:09.892
- WE'VE GOT THE WRONG ROOMMATE

20:19.410 --> 20:21.742
- I KNOW WHERE WE NEED TO BE.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

20:28.590 --> 20:30.979
- WHY ARE WE AT A BLOOD BANK?

20:31.030 --> 20:33.328
- WELL, IT'S REALLY COMMON
FOR FULL FLEDGED VAMPIRES

20:33.360 --> 20:35.351
TO WANDER THE BARRENS,
YOU KNOW, GRAVEYARDS,

20:35.400 --> 20:36.799
INDUSTRIAL WASTELAN DS.

20:36.830 --> 20:38.559
PLACES OF IRREVERSIBLE
URBAN BLIGHT.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.999
THE BLOOD BANK DOES
SEEM A LIKELY PLACE

20:40.030 --> 20:42.396
FOR THE UNDEAD TO
QUENCH THE HUNGER.

20:42.440 --> 20:43.862
- FIVE MINUTES,
AND WE ARE LEAVING.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.707
THERE IS JUST 0% CHANCE
THAT I'M GETTING

20:45.740 --> 20:49.005
CAUGHT UP IN THIS FANTASTICAL,
VAMPIRE NONSENSE.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.349
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
THERE'S A CHANCE.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.974
- NO, SHAWN,
I SAID 0%.

20:58.490 --> 20:59.514
- EDWARD HAS ENTERED
THE BUILDING.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.858
- WHAT? WHERE?

21:00.890 --> 21:02.858
- IT'S A CLASSIC
SHIFTING TECHNIQUE.

21:02.890 --> 21:04.653
IT'S INCOGNITO
MAN-TO-ANIMAL MANEUVER.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.328
- THAT'S CORRECT,
IT'S LOOKS LIKE WEMAY BE

21:06.360 --> 21:08.794
DEALING WITH AN ELDER,
OR EVEN WORSE, A DIABLERIE.

21:08.830 --> 21:09.854
- NO
- YES.

21:09.900 --> 21:10.924
- WE'RE LEAVING.

21:10.970 --> 21:11.868
- WHAT?
- NO.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.333
- WHY DID WE COME ALL
THE WAY OUT HERE?

21:13.370 --> 21:14.632
- EDWARD IS IN THE BUILDING.

21:14.670 --> 21:16.535
- TO INVESTIGATE,
HE'S WONDERING AROUND.

21:16.570 --> 21:19.061
- GOD, I USED TO BE A DETECTIVE,
NOW I'M A BABYSITTER.

21:19.110 --> 21:21.601
- THAT MAKES YOU ELISABETH SHUE
AND GUS IS KEITH COOGAN.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.868
- YOU'RE COOGAN.
- YOU'RE COOGAN.

21:22.910 --> 21:23.899
- YOUR MOMMA'S COOGAN.

21:30.050 --> 21:31.688
- HELLO, EDWARD.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.553
- JUST ACT NATURAL.
NEVER LOOK A FELINE IN EYES,

21:34.590 --> 21:35.682
LEST YOU WANT TO BE A--

21:35.720 --> 21:37.779
- JUST STOP IT.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.457
- HERE WE GO.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.772
- HE IS LOOKING
RIGHT AT YOU, GUS.

21:56.810 --> 21:57.845
- HE IS LOOKING AT JULIET.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.507
- NO, HE ISN'T.

21:59.550 --> 22:02.474
[elevator ding]

22:05.890 --> 22:07.414
- DID I JUST SEE WHAT
MY BRAIN IS TELLING

22:07.460 --> 22:08.813
MY EYES THAT I JUST SAW?

22:08.860 --> 22:10.782
- WAS THAT A CAPE?

22:10.830 --> 22:13.697
[growl]

22:17.430 --> 22:18.795
- OKAY, HOW DID IT GET FROM
ONE END OF THE BUILDING

22:18.830 --> 22:20.491
TO THE OTHER IN TWO SECONDS?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.735
[glass shattering]

22:27.040 --> 22:28.439
- BLOOD PRODUCTS.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.036
- DETECTIVE, WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

22:55.070 --> 22:56.992
- WE HAD GOOD REASON
TO BELIEVE OUR SUSPECT

22:57.040 --> 22:58.962
WAS HERE IN THE BLOOD BANK.

22:59.010 --> 23:03.447
WE ENTERED AND WHAT WE
SAW WAS A HOODED FIGURE,

23:03.480 --> 23:07.519
WHO APPEARED TO MOVE
WITH INEXPLICABLE SPEED,

23:07.550 --> 23:08.972
AS IF IT WERE A...

23:09.020 --> 23:11.682
- MR. SPENCER, IF I MAY, WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS SOMEONE

23:11.720 --> 23:15.554
WHO IS CAPABLE OF VAMP SPEED OR
AT PRESENT-SPACE QUANTUM LEAP.

23:15.590 --> 23:17.421
- BLACULA GIVES
A SHOUT OUT TO BACKULA.

23:17.460 --> 23:19.621
- THE TRUTH IS,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE SAW.

23:19.660 --> 23:23.118
- HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS,
SAID SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY,

23:23.160 --> 23:24.991
AND IN DUE TIME WE'LL BE ABLE
TO STICK THE NAILS TO HIM.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.998
- LET ME SAY THAT SHAWN
AND GUS' OPINION

23:27.030 --> 23:28.691
DOES NOT REFLECT MY OWN.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.504
- WHAT SUSPECT?

23:36.110 --> 23:37.839
THAT'S A FELINE.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.472
- THAT WILL DRINK
YOU LIKE A JUICE BOX.

23:39.510 --> 23:41.068
DON'T BE DECEIVED.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.815
THAT'S A GROWN ASS MAN
WHO FEEDS OFF THE BLOOD...

23:42.850 --> 23:43.885
- GUS, YOU MUST STOP.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.148
- LOOK, I'M GONNA TELL THE CHIEF

23:45.190 --> 23:46.748
THAT DETECTIVE
O'HARA IS IN FULL,

23:46.790 --> 23:49.213
UNDETERRED CONTROL
OF THIS INVESTIGATION,

23:49.260 --> 23:52.582
I'LL SPARE THE JUICY DETAILS.

24:03.670 --> 24:05.535
- I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

24:06.840 --> 24:10.105
SHOOT THE GLASS.

24:12.780 --> 24:13.917
SOUNDS GOOD BROTHER.

24:13.950 --> 24:14.974
- YEAH.

24:21.820 --> 24:22.855
- UH-OH, WHERE'S LASSIE?

24:22.890 --> 24:24.118
- I'M PRETTY SURE
HE INVITED HIS

24:24.160 --> 24:25.058
NEW GIRLFRIEND OVER FOR DINNER.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.058
- IF HE INVITES A VAMPIRE
INTO HIS HOME

24:27.090 --> 24:28.626
IT'S FREE TO FEED
ON HIM AT WILL.

24:28.660 --> 24:29.752
- WE ARE THE ONLY
ONES IN THE WORLD

24:29.800 --> 24:30.789
THAT CAN SAVE HIM RIGHT NOW.

24:30.830 --> 24:31.922
- LET'S GO.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.808
- HI, CARLTON.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.910
[laughs]

24:47.950 --> 24:50.077
MM, SOMETHING SMELLS
DELICIOUS.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.145
- WELL, I WOULD LIKE
TO SAY IT'S THE ELK LOIN

24:52.190 --> 24:53.987
I'VE BEEN BRAISING,
BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT

24:54.020 --> 24:57.217
INTOXICATING SCENT IS YOU,
MARLOWE.

24:57.260 --> 24:58.784
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN?

24:58.830 --> 25:02.152
- I'D LOVE TO.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.638
HI.
- HI.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.650
[knocking]

25:36.700 --> 25:38.622
- COME LASSIE,
LET THE RIGHT ONES IN, BUDDY.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.069
- UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY UNDEAD.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.795
- IN WHICH CASE WOULD YOU
KINDLY IMPALE YOURSELF

25:41.840 --> 25:43.068
WITH A WOODEN STAKE?

25:43.100 --> 25:44.931
- SPENCER, GUSTER, GO AWAY!

25:44.970 --> 25:46.801
- CARLTON, OPEN THE DOOR!

25:46.840 --> 25:48.068
- O'HARA!?

25:48.110 --> 25:50.032
- GIVE US SOME SORT OF
SIGNAL THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.002
A COUGH OR A THUMP OF SOME KIND.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.642
- HENRY?

25:53.680 --> 25:55.272
- SHOULD I CALL FOR
THE BATTERING RAM?

25:55.320 --> 25:57.811
- MCNAB!

25:57.850 --> 25:59.738
- WHAT THE HELL IS
WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

25:59.790 --> 26:01.087
CAN'T YOU SEE I'M IN
THE THROES OF PASSION?

26:01.120 --> 26:02.712
CONTRARY TO PUBLIC OPINION,

26:02.760 --> 26:04.182
I DO NOT GET THIS KIND
OF ACTION EVERY NIGHT!

26:04.230 --> 26:05.857
- ARE YOU WEARING GARTERS?

26:08.930 --> 26:12.058
- NO, YOU DULLARD, THESE ARE
STANDARD, MILITARY ISSUE.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.193
THEY KEEP MY SHIRT TUCKED TIGHT
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

26:24.010 --> 26:25.807
- WE FOUND THIS PRESS ON NAIL
AT THE SANTA BARBARA

26:25.850 --> 26:28.273
BLOOD BANK WHICH WAS
ROBBED EARLIER THIS EVENING.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.141
- MARLOWE, YOU MIND SHOWING US
YOUR MITTS PLEASE?

26:39.130 --> 26:40.995
- THIS IS JUST
A CRAZY COINCIDENCE.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.863
THESE NAILS WERE MADE
POPULAR BY JERSEY SHORE.

26:43.900 --> 26:46.061
- NICE TRY, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED.

26:46.100 --> 26:51.037
- JWOWW DOES WEAR THOSE NAILS
WHEN THEY GO OUT CLUBBING.

26:51.070 --> 26:53.800
WHAT? I'M NOT SAYING
I BUY HER STORY.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.671
- BUT MARLOWE SAID
THEY'RE VERY COMMON.

26:55.710 --> 26:57.405
WE CERTAINLY NEED
MORE EVIDENCE THAN THIS.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.998
- OKAY, WELL THEN I'M
SURE SHE WON'T HAVE

26:59.050 --> 27:00.403
A PROBLEM WITH US
SEARCHING HER HOUSE.

27:00.450 --> 27:03.271
- OF COURSE SHE WON'T.
SHE'S NOTHING TO HIDE, RIGHT?

27:03.320 --> 27:05.686
- UH-HUH.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.244
SO LETS GO OVER THERE
AND CLEAR HER GOOD NAME.

27:14.260 --> 27:15.295
- GOT ANYTHING?

27:15.330 --> 27:16.729
- NOT YET.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.318
- DON'T RUSH BE SHAWN,
I'M BEING THOROUGH.

27:33.380 --> 27:38.181
- UH-OH! I'M SENSING SOMETHING
COLD AND VERY UNFORTUNATE,

27:38.220 --> 27:41.314
SOMETHING ICY LIKE
MARLOWE'S AORTA.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.419
- SPENCER, THIS IS
PERSONAL FOR ME.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.121
EITHER CONDUCT
YOURSELF LIKE AN ADULT,

27:45.160 --> 27:47.697
OR I WILL REMOVE YOU FROM
THESE PREMISES BY FORCE.

27:47.730 --> 27:49.095
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
THAT WAS INSENSITIVE.

27:49.130 --> 27:51.189
I'M SORRY, COME ON.
LET'S HUG IT OUT.

27:51.230 --> 27:52.891
- I WOULD RATHER LEARN
TO PLAY THE HARP.

27:52.930 --> 27:53.965
- OKAY.

27:58.140 --> 27:59.437
THIS IS NICE.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.350
HELLO, PLASMA.

28:15.390 --> 28:18.154
- OKAY, SO I DID
TAKE THE BLOOD.

28:18.190 --> 28:20.158
BUT ONLY BECAUSE I'M
TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET

28:20.190 --> 28:21.418
AND THEY PAY REALLY GOOD MONEY

28:21.460 --> 28:23.098
ON THE BLACK MARKET
FOR THAT.

28:23.130 --> 28:25.997
BUT I PROMISE
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

28:26.030 --> 28:28.760
I CAN'T BEAR WHAT YOU MUST
THINK OF ME RIGHT NOW.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.994
BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

28:33.810 --> 28:35.004
- I CAN'T.

28:36.510 --> 28:38.842
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
- WHAT?

28:38.880 --> 28:40.814
- O'HARA, THIS CASE
IS OFFICIALLY YOURS.

28:40.850 --> 28:43.114
I'LL BE IN MY APARTMENT
IF YOU NEED ME.

28:43.150 --> 28:44.879
I TRUST YOU WILL NOT.

28:50.390 --> 28:51.254
- WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO,

28:51.290 --> 28:53.155
HAUL ALL THIS BLOOD
BACK TO THE BANK?

28:53.190 --> 28:54.521
- NO, I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST LEAVE IT HERE.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.768
- WOULD YOU RELAX, BUDDY?
LOOK, THIS STUFF IS LOCKED

28:57.800 --> 28:59.392
AND LOADED IN THESE
THICK RUBBER BAGGY--

29:12.850 --> 29:15.410
- IS HE RESPONSIVE AT ALL?

29:15.450 --> 29:18.089
- NO, NOTHING.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.382
WE EVEN HELD
A PLATE OF BEAN

29:19.420 --> 29:21.980
AND CHEESE NACHOS
IN FRONT OF HIS FACE.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.282
- HOW MUCH BLOOD WAS IT,
EXACTLY, SHAWN?

29:23.320 --> 29:24.526
- JUST A LITTLE STREAM,

29:24.560 --> 29:25.788
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS
THE END OF CARRIE,

29:25.830 --> 29:26.956
OR THE BEGINNING OF CARRIE.

29:26.990 --> 29:29.220
LOOK, JULES, DID YOU GET
MARLOWE TO CON FESS

29:29.260 --> 29:30.397
TO THE MURDER OR WHAT?

29:30.430 --> 29:32.967
- NO, BUT IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE SHE CRACKS.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.536
I JUST FEEL SO BAD
FOR LASSITER.

29:34.570 --> 29:36.367
HE SEEMED TO REALLY
CARE ABOUT THIS GIRL.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.469
OH, SHAWN,
HANG ON A SECOND.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.400
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT A MAN WAS JUST ATTACKED

29:39.440 --> 29:40.839
IN THE PARKING LOT OF LOX,
STOCK

29:40.880 --> 29:43.030
AND TWO TOASTED BAGELS,
OVER ON FLETCHER STREET,

29:43.080 --> 29:46.299
AND THE PERPETRATOR ATTEMPTED
TO DRAIN HIM OF HIS BLOOD.

29:46.350 --> 29:47.578
HE'S AT
ST. THOMAS OF THE APOSTLES.

29:47.610 --> 29:48.975
- SHAWN, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

29:49.020 --> 29:51.909
- YES! GREATEST NAME
FOR A BAGEL JOINT EVER.

29:51.950 --> 29:53.918
PLUS, THIS MEANS LASSIE
IS LOVE WITH A LIAR

29:53.960 --> 29:56.178
AND A BLOOD THIEF,
BUT NOT A FULL-ON MURDERER!

29:56.220 --> 29:58.188
- SLAP GUS AS HARD AS YOU CAN,
AND MEET ME AT THE HOSPITAL.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.982
- COPY THAT.

30:00.030 --> 30:01.452
ALL RIGHT DAD.
I GOT THIS.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.196
- OKAY.

30:04.230 --> 30:05.822
- ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN UP, BUDDY.

30:05.870 --> 30:09.089
THIS HURTS ME WAY MORE
THAN IT HURTS YOU.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.108
OH!

30:14.140 --> 30:16.608
- WELCOME BACK, GUSTER.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.471
- PAGING DR. BENDER.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.283
- HE'S CLEARLY NOT
GONNA EAT IT, SHAWN.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.514
AND I'M HUNGRY LIKE A MUG.

30:25.550 --> 30:28.917
- YOU'RE HUNGRY LIKE A WHAT?

30:28.960 --> 30:31.622
- OKAY, RON, CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT?

30:31.660 --> 30:33.958
- YEAH.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.592
- OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED?

30:35.630 --> 30:37.154
- A GUY IN A CAPE ATTACKED ME.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.327
- DID YOU GET A GOOD
LOOK AT HIS FACE?

30:39.370 --> 30:40.496
- NO.

30:40.530 --> 30:42.589
- ARE YOU SURE?

30:42.640 --> 30:44.130
- NAH.

30:44.170 --> 30:45.467
- ALL RIGHT, WELL THANKS, RON.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.102
YOU'VE BEEN A HUGE HELP SO FAR.

30:47.140 --> 30:49.131
THIS IS THE CHIEF,
I'M GONNA TAKE IT OUTSIDE.

30:50.610 --> 30:51.941
- YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.345
- I HAVEN'T EATEN
SINCE BREAKFAST.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.018
- ANOTHER MAN'S SANDWICH.

30:55.050 --> 30:56.176
- SO.

30:56.220 --> 30:59.144
- SOMEONE IS LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.613
- WHO?
- WELL, YOU ARE SON.

31:13.070 --> 31:15.095
- O NEGATIVE.
- DO WHAT?

31:15.140 --> 31:16.937
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
HIS BLOOD TYPE?

31:16.970 --> 31:18.665
- IT'S A SPECIAL GIFT
THAT I BUST OUT IN RARE

31:18.710 --> 31:20.598
OCCASIONS AND
ALMOST ALL THE TIME.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.676
- WELL, YES, RON HERE
HAS ONE OF THE RAREST

31:22.710 --> 31:23.938
BLOOD TYPES THERE IS.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.140
- HOW RARE?

31:25.180 --> 31:28.479
- EXTREMELY. IN FACT...

31:28.520 --> 31:30.272
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR A BLOOD DONOR.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.481
BUT, THERE ARE ONLY
WROTE TWO DOZEN PEOPLE

31:32.520 --> 31:35.159
IN SANTA BARBARA WHO
HAVE O NEGATIVE BLOOD.

31:35.190 --> 31:36.953
- THE KILLER IS
AFTER O NEGATIVE.

31:36.990 --> 31:38.218
I NEED A DIVERSION.

31:38.260 --> 31:41.195
SLIP A DISC
OR START PEEING YOURSELF.

31:41.230 --> 31:42.424
DOCTOR, MY FRIEND
HAS PEED HIMSELF.

31:42.460 --> 31:45.429
- NO, I SLIPPED A DISC.
AHH.

31:45.470 --> 31:48.633
- JUST BREATHE, YOUNG MAN.
IT'S PROBABLY JUST A SPASM.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.109
- IT HURTS.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.607
- GUS, HAVE SOME
RESPECT FOR YOURSELF.

32:00.680 --> 32:01.578
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

32:01.620 --> 32:03.679
- YES, DOCTOR,
I BREATHED INTO THE SPASM

32:03.720 --> 32:05.540
AND IT LOOSENED UP NICELY.

32:09.190 --> 32:10.919
- THANKS DOCTOR.
- THANK YOU.

32:12.560 --> 32:16.394
- DUDE, ONE OF THE NAMES ON
THE LIST IS ADRIAN VICCELLIO.

32:16.430 --> 32:17.397
I BET YOU THAT'S
MARLOWE'S BROTHER.

32:17.430 --> 32:20.069
HE HAS SOMETHING CALLED
VAN WILDER'S DISEASE.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.591
- VON WILLIBRAND'S.
THAT'S A RARE BLOOD DISORDER

32:22.640 --> 32:24.335
THAT REQUIRES ITS PATIENTS
TO HAVE TRANSFUSIONS

32:24.370 --> 32:25.667
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.337
IT USUALLY AFFECT S HUMANS
AND DOBERMAN PINSCHERS.

32:27.370 --> 32:28.701
- THAT'S ODDLY SPECIFIC.

32:33.150 --> 32:34.674
- THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF VWD,

32:34.720 --> 32:36.608
TYPE TWO IS DIVIDED
INTO FOUR SUBTYPES.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.618
SHAWN, I BET YOU ANYTHING
THAT OUR GUY HAD

32:38.650 --> 32:40.345
THE WORST TYPE AND
LOST HIS INSURANCE.

32:40.390 --> 32:42.483
- THAT'S IT, HE'S HAVING
TO STEAL THE BLOOD FROM

32:42.520 --> 32:44.124
THE FEW PEOPLE THAT HAVE
HIS RARE BLOOD TYPE.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.559
- HE PROBABLY SWIPED
THE LIST OF MATCHING DONORS

32:45.590 --> 32:46.625
DURING HIS LAST HOSPITAL STAY.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.059
- WELL, THAT'S JUST CONJECTURE.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.158
- IT'S ALL CONJECTURE, SHAWN.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.349
THAT'S ALL WE'RE
DOING RIGHT NOW.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.095
- ALL RIGHT, RON, WE ARE
GONNA NEED A SWAB

32:52.130 --> 32:54.598
YOUR CLOTHING
AND BOTH YOUR FISTS.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.097
- JULES, JULES, IT'S MARLOWE'S
BROTHER ADRIAN.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.734
HE HAS SOMETHING CALLED
DON SKARSGARD'S DISEASE.

32:59.770 --> 33:02.238
HE NEEDS A LOT OF RARE
BLOOD, O NEGATIVE,

33:02.280 --> 33:03.338
AND HE'S HAVING TO STEAL IT

33:03.380 --> 33:04.449
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
HAVE INSURANCE.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.573
- DID YOU JUST SAY O NEGATIVE?
- YEAH.

33:06.610 --> 33:09.170
- THAT'S CARLTON'S BLOOD
TYPE WE GOT TO GO.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.381
- CARLTON,
PLEASE DON'T HANG UP.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.047
I BEGGED THE POLICE
FOR THIS CALL.

33:13.090 --> 33:14.717
I HAD TO CALL YOU TO TELL YOU

33:14.760 --> 33:16.250
THAT YOU COULD
IN SOME SERIOUS--

33:16.290 --> 33:17.382
- THERE IS A CAGE, MARLOWE--

33:17.420 --> 33:20.651
A CAGE MADE OF BRAWN AND
STEEL THAT PROTECT S MY HEART.

33:20.690 --> 33:22.658
I WELCOMED YOU
INSIDE THAT CAGE,

33:22.700 --> 33:24.622
I OFFER YOU A SEASON
PASS TO THE FESTIVAL

33:24.670 --> 33:27.468
OF LIGHT THAT HAPPENS
IN MY CHEST CAVITY.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.161
- FESTIVAL?

33:30.670 --> 33:32.535
WHAT'S WORSE IS
YOU NEVER WANTED IT.

33:32.570 --> 33:35.232
- I DO WANT IT, BUT I NEED TO
WARN YOU THAT YOU COULD...

33:35.280 --> 33:37.737
- NOW, I'M GOING TO TELL
YOU THE SAME THING

33:37.780 --> 33:39.805
I TOLD MY MOTHER AND
HER NEW GIRLFRIEND

33:39.850 --> 33:42.148
THE DAY I LEFT FOR THE ACADEMY.

33:42.180 --> 33:45.616
WHY DON'T YOU BOTH
JUST GET IN YOUR CAR

33:45.650 --> 33:48.551
AND THELMA & LOUISE YOURSELVES
RIGHT INTO THE PACIFIC?

33:48.590 --> 33:51.684
IT WAS AN UGLY THING TO SAY
AND I WISH I COULD TAKE IT BACK,

33:51.730 --> 33:55.621
BUT I WAS CONFUSED.

33:55.660 --> 33:58.299
I DIDN'T WANT MY MOTHER
TO BE A LESBIAN AT 53.

33:58.330 --> 34:00.195
EVENTUALLY I CAME TO
REALIZE THAT ALTH EA MAKES

34:00.230 --> 34:01.788
HER HAPPY IN A WAY
THAT DAD NEVER COULD.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.707
- CARLTON, I NEED YOU TO
FOCUS AND LISTEN TO ME.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.731
[loud bang]

34:06.770 --> 34:08.135
- SPENCER, GO AWAY.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.239
- CARLTON, DON'T
ANSWER THE DOOR.

34:10.280 --> 34:11.577
[loud knocking]
- HANG ON A SECOND.

34:11.610 --> 34:14.374
- WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

34:14.420 --> 34:17.309
- IS TAMARA HOME?
- WHO THE HELL IS TAMARA?

34:18.890 --> 34:21.108
- CARLTON? CARLTON?

34:29.630 --> 34:33.327
- YOU'RE THAT HOOLIGAN
FROM THAT AWFUL HABERDASHERY.

34:33.370 --> 34:36.339
- IT'S EASIER IF YOU
DON'T TALK, DETECTIVE.

34:36.370 --> 34:40.136
IF YOU JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES,
ALL OF THIS NASTY BUSINESS

34:40.170 --> 34:43.776
WILL BE OVER BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT, I PROMISE.

34:43.810 --> 34:46.506
- MARLOWE AND HER BROTHER
BOTH ROBBED THE BLOOD BANK.

34:51.850 --> 34:53.317
WE WERE ACTUALLY SEEING
TWO PEOPLE!

34:53.350 --> 34:55.181
- SO, YOU SEE, THERE IS
A RATIONAL EXPLANATION

34:55.220 --> 34:56.312
FOR EVERYTHING, SHAWN.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.509
- THERE IS NO RATIONAL

34:57.560 --> 34:59.482
EXPLANATION FOR ANYTHING,
UNTIL WE SEE THE OTHER ROOMMATE

34:59.530 --> 35:01.498
AND THAT BLACK CAT TOGETHER
IN THE SAME PLACE

35:01.530 --> 35:03.157
AT THE SAME TIME!

35:03.200 --> 35:06.397
- I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF HANGING UP ON MY BIG SIS.

35:06.430 --> 35:07.658
SHE'S PRETTY UPSET.

35:07.700 --> 35:13.332
- MARLOWE IS YOUR SISTER?
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

35:13.370 --> 35:15.509
I FIGURED SHE WOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU, SEEING HOW SHE'S ALL

35:15.540 --> 35:17.508
SWEET ON YOU.

35:17.540 --> 35:20.509
- SHE IS?
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

35:20.550 --> 35:24.338
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY
WITH THIS, AND YOUR SISTER--

35:24.390 --> 35:28.178
- LOOK.
I'M ONE TOUGH SON OF A BITCH,

35:28.220 --> 35:30.654
AND I'M HAPPY FOR MARLOWE.

35:30.690 --> 35:33.420
SHE'S BEEN SACRIFICING
EVERYTHING

35:33.460 --> 35:38.568
AND TAKING CARE OF ME FOREVER,
AND SHE DESERVES..

35:41.970 --> 35:45.929
A NICE GUY WHO WILL TAKE CARE
OF HER, YOU KNOW?

35:45.970 --> 35:49.201
- I CAN'T REALLY DO THAT
IF I'M DEAD NOW, CAN I?

35:49.240 --> 35:52.949
JUST MAKE ONE SMART MOVE...
- I'M NOT GOING TO KILL YOU.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.709
NOBODY WAS EVER SUPPOSED TO DIE.

35:54.750 --> 35:59.449
THAT FIRST GUY WAS ALIVE
WHEN I LEFT HIM, I SWEAR IT.

36:01.690 --> 36:04.727
I WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE, SEE,

36:04.760 --> 36:07.320
EXCEPT I CAN ONLY ASSAULT
INNOCENT BLOOD DONORS

36:07.360 --> 36:10.227
WHEN I HAVE MY STRENGTH
AND RIGHT NOW I'M FRESHLY

36:10.260 --> 36:13.696
TRANSFUSED OR...WAS.

36:13.730 --> 36:14.958
THAT GUY ON THE LIST
AHEAD OF YOU

36:15.000 --> 36:16.729
KICKED MY ASS EARLIER
TONIGHT.

36:16.770 --> 36:18.260
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

36:19.970 --> 36:23.838
- AND IN A COUPLE OF DAYS,
I'M GONNA BE CLINGING

36:23.880 --> 36:26.678
ONTO LIFE AGAIN.

36:26.710 --> 36:29.645
[snorting]

36:29.680 --> 36:31.841
SO, HERE WE ARE,
DESPERATE TIMES

36:31.890 --> 36:36.589
CALL FOR BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

36:36.620 --> 36:38.588
- THE DUDE IS A REAL-LIFE
VAMPIRE, BABE!

36:38.630 --> 36:39.756
- I'M NOT CONCEDING THE FACT

36:39.790 --> 36:40.984
THAT VAMPIRES DON'T EXIST,
AND YOU KNOW YOU GUYS COULD

36:41.030 --> 36:43.498
AT LEAST PRETEND TO BE A LITTLE
BIT CONCERNED ABOUT CARLTON.

36:43.530 --> 36:46.499
- HEY, WHATEVER THE SITUATION
MAY BE, I'M SURE LASSIE

36:46.530 --> 36:48.634
IS FIRMLY IN CONTROL.
DANGER IS HIS MIDDLE NAME.

36:48.670 --> 36:51.605
- I FOR ONE, AM LESS OPTIMISTIC.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.473
- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SICK,
WE CAN GET YOU SOME HELP.

36:54.510 --> 36:55.829
THIS IS INSANE.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.872
- SEE, THE INSURANCE DARLINGS
NO LONGER FEEL ANY

36:58.910 --> 37:01.413
RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP OUT.

37:01.450 --> 37:04.544
I AM A LIABILITY, YOU SEE.

37:04.590 --> 37:07.548
- THINK ABOUT MARLOWE,
AND SHE'S AN ACCOMPLICE.

37:07.590 --> 37:08.716
SHE'LL DO HARD TIME.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.354
- SHE NEVER LAID A FINGER
ON ANYONE.

37:11.390 --> 37:12.482
YOU WERE HER FIRST MARK,

37:12.530 --> 37:15.920
AND WE BOTH KNOW HOW THAT WENT.
SO SHE STOLE SOME BLOOD.

37:15.960 --> 37:19.259
BIG DEAL.
SHE DID IT TO SAVE A LIFE.

37:19.300 --> 37:22.963
AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S THERE FOR,
ISN'T IT?

37:23.000 --> 37:27.937
WELL, ISN'T IT?
NO MORE TALKING.

37:40.020 --> 37:41.851
- CARLTON!
ARE YOU OKAY IN THERE?

37:41.890 --> 37:45.758
- GUS, QUICK--GIVE ME
YOUR CREDIT CARD.

37:45.790 --> 37:47.655
GREAT.
JULES, KICK THE DOOR IN.

37:47.690 --> 37:49.920
- WHAT!
- CARLTON! OPEN THE DOOR!

37:52.100 --> 37:54.398
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- NEVER BETTER. WE NEED TO GET

37:54.440 --> 37:56.328
THIS YOUNG MAN TO THE HOSPITAL,
THEN THE STATION.

37:56.370 --> 37:59.760
IT'S POSSIBLY IN THAT ORDER,
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE.

38:02.440 --> 38:08.709
- OH! WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
- CHLOROFORM, SNEAK ATTACK.

38:08.750 --> 38:11.548
UNBEKNOWNST TO MY ASSAILANT,
I'VE SLOWLY

38:11.590 --> 38:13.945
AND METHODICALLY BEEN BUILDING
UP A TOLERANCE TO CHLOROFORM

38:13.990 --> 38:16.458
OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS.

38:16.490 --> 38:17.718
- DEAR GOD, WHY?

38:17.760 --> 38:19.682
- FOR A NIGHT LIKE THIS,
SPENCER.

38:19.730 --> 38:21.698
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

38:21.730 --> 38:23.698
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME OTHER
KIND OF CHEMICAL.

38:23.730 --> 38:28.099
- OH, GREAT, NOW WE HAVE

38:28.130 --> 38:29.688
TO CARRY TWO
GUYS OUT OF HERE.

38:40.650 --> 38:41.844
- I MEAN,
LOOK AT HIM.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.973
HE REALLY WORE HIS HEART ON HIS
SLEEVE THROUGH ALL OF THIS,

38:44.020 --> 38:46.079
I MEAN HE'S OBVIOUSLY HURTING,
AND I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE

38:46.120 --> 38:47.917
NICE IF HE KNEW THAT WE WERE ALL
HERE FOR HIM.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.918
- WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO?
- SERIOUSLY.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.588
- WELL, GO TALK TO HIM.
GIVE HIM SOME ENCOURAGEMENT,

38:52.630 --> 38:54.655
LET HIM KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY
OF FISH IN THE SEA.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.998
- ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS?
- FINE.

38:59.530 --> 39:01.361
- WHAT IS THAT?
- SPIDER.

39:01.400 --> 39:07.464
- CRAP ON A CRACKER.
- THERE IS NO SPIDER.

39:07.510 --> 39:10.707
- THERE WAS NO SPIDER.
NOW HE'S HERE, AND HE'S HAIRY,

39:10.740 --> 39:12.605
AND HE'S VENOMOUS
AND HE IS UNBEATABLE.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.618
- THE OTHER THREE ARE ALL
INANIMATE OBJECTS, SHAWN.

39:14.650 --> 39:16.140
A SPIDER CAN'T BITE
A PAIR OF SCISSORS.

39:16.180 --> 39:18.011
- YEAH, HE'S RIGHT,
SCISSORS CLEARLY HAVE

39:18.050 --> 39:21.383
THE ADVANTAGE AND WELL,
ROCK CRUSHES SPIDER.

39:21.420 --> 39:24.116
OH BUT I SUPPOSE SPIDER
CRAWLS ON PAPER?

39:33.100 --> 39:35.534
- GO ON.

39:38.510 --> 39:39.499
- HEY, LASSIE.

39:41.540 --> 39:45.601
I JUST WANTED TO SAY,
YOU KNOW THAT THE SEA IS VAST

39:45.650 --> 39:50.144
AND FILLED WITH MANY STRANGE
CREATURES AND CORALS.

39:52.150 --> 39:55.984
MOSTLY DIVORCED CORALS,
PROBABLY WITH A BUNCH OF KIDS,

39:56.020 --> 39:58.853
AND THEY'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR ANY OLD CRUSTACEAN

39:58.890 --> 40:00.187
WITH A STEADY INCOME SO...
- SORRY, SPENCER.

40:00.230 --> 40:02.596
NO TIME FOR YOUR EMPTY,
BONE-HEADED MUSINGS.

40:02.630 --> 40:04.393
I'M LATE FOR AN APPOINTMENT.

40:13.040 --> 40:16.703
- TRANSPORT DETAIL,
REPORT TO INMATE RECEPTION.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.605
TRANSPORT DETAIL,
REPORT TO INMATE RECEPTION.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.564
- I WASN'T SURE YOU'D COME.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.831
- I AM A MAN OF MY WORD.
- I'M SO SORRY. I WISH I--

40:46.870 --> 40:49.907
- LOOK, YOU DID WHAT YOU
THOUGHT YOU HAD TO DO.

40:52.710 --> 40:54.473
IF THERE'S AN UPSIDE TO ANY
OF THIS, IT'S THAT YOUR BROTHER

40:54.520 --> 40:55.771
WILL FINALLY GET THE CARE
HE NEEDS

40:55.820 --> 40:57.048
NOW THAT HE'S GONNA
BE IN THE SYSTEM

40:57.080 --> 41:00.811
FOR A LONG, LONG, LONG TIME.

41:02.590 --> 41:03.989
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

41:05.890 --> 41:07.585
- ANYTHING.
- WHERE WOULD YOU RATE

41:07.630 --> 41:10.793
PINK CADILLAC
IN EASTWOOD CANON?

41:10.830 --> 41:12.866
- NOT VERY HIGH I'M AFRAID.

41:12.900 --> 41:15.198
I MEAN I SUPPOSE IT'S A GOOD
COMPANION PIECE

41:15.240 --> 41:18.164
TO CITY HEAT BUT HE'S MUCH
FUNNIER WITH THE ORANGUTAN.
