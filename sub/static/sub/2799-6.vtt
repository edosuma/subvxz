01:43.645 --> 01:48.150
28. The decedent's name
is Christina Adalian,

01:48.192 --> 01:49.151
Gunshot to the temple.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.653
Her sist er is over there,

01:51.695 --> 01:53.655
just came in from L.A.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.657
When no one answered the
door, she looked inside.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.159
Saw her sist er on the floor.

01:57.159 --> 02:00.162
The playpen with the baby
was next to the body.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.164
Police officers
kicked in the door

02:02.206 --> 02:03.665
Where's the father?

02:03.665 --> 02:04.666
Well, according to her sister,

02:04.666 --> 02:05.667
she's a single mom,
they lived alone.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.670
Hey.

02:09.670 --> 02:12.174
Lividity suggests
she hasn't been moved.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.176
Liver temp is 92 degrees

02:14.176 --> 02:17.679
which means she's been dead
four to five hours.

02:17.721 --> 02:21.183
Wound pattern and GSR suggest
a tight contact shot.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.185
Consistent with suicide.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.686
Oh, there's a note
on the white table.

02:28.190 --> 02:32.945
"Joey is better off without me.
Christina Adalian. "

02:32.986 --> 02:37.699
Postpartum depression so bad,
it leads to suicide?

02:38.200 --> 02:40.202
Sister was feeding the baby.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.204
Where'd she get the bottle

02:42.204 --> 02:44.706
The fridge is full of bottles
of breast milk.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.211
Mom stocks the fridge
and kills herself,

02:49.711 --> 02:51.213
knowing her sister
was going to show up.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.716
She wanted to make sure that her
baby was quickly found and fed.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.218
David,

02:56.218 --> 02:57.719
do you mind if I render
the gun safe?

02:57.761 --> 02:59.721
Better you than me

03:13.735 --> 03:15.237
One shot fired.

03:15.237 --> 03:18.740
Sara, check out the blood
on her hand.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.245
There isn't any.

03:23.245 --> 03:27.249
The gun is spattered
in dried blood.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.251
She wasn't holding this gun
when she was shot.

03:29.293 --> 03:32.754
And what appears to be, is not.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.764
? Who... are you??

03:42.764 --> 03:46.018
? Who, who, who, who??

03:46.059 --> 03:49.271
? Who... are you??

03:49.271 --> 03:50.772
? Who, who, who, who??

03:50.772 --> 03:52.274
? I really want to know?

03:52.774 --> 03:55.277
? Who... are you??

03:55.277 --> 03:57.279
?Oh-oh-oh?
?Who...?

03:57.279 --> 04:00.282
? Come on tell me
who are you, you, you?

04:00.782 --> 04:02.784
? Oh, you!?

04:20.802 --> 04:23.263
Honest.
I am good with kids.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.806
I'll get a hotel.
I'll stay in town.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.767
I know we've been over this befo re.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.061
Like I said, he'
ll be placed in Child Services

04:29.102 --> 04:30.687
until appropriate cust
ody can be determine d.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.314
That's just the way
it is. I'm so rry.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.316
Metro just arrived with
a baby seat. We're ready.

04:34.816 --> 04:35.776
All right.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.319
I'd really like
to go with him.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.779
Okay, after we're finished,

04:38.820 --> 04:40.322
an officer will take you
to the facility.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.282
Finished with what?

04:42.324 --> 04:43.784
Well, we have
a few more questions.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.827
And, uh, CSI has to take
your fingerprints.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.329
It won't take long,
believe me

04:47.371 --> 04:48.789
Well, what about his bottles?

04:48.830 --> 04:51.333
They're in a cooler
in the officer's car.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.793
Ma'am.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.795
It's okay.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.839
It's o kay. It's
gonna be all right.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.341
Come on.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.093
It's okay.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.344
You're okay.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.855
Can't find a red pen anywhere.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.857
Well, maybe the killer
brought his own pen.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.859
Or took it with him
as a souvenir.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.366
Okay, guys.

05:24.867 --> 05:25.826
I swept the perimeter.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.870
I think someone jimmied
the back kitchen door.

05:29.872 --> 05:32.875
Now, I printed the doorknob.
Nothing but smudges.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.835
But check out the fresh scrapings

05:34.877 --> 05:36.879
there on the door jamb
and the striker plat .

05:38.881 --> 05:41.383
Looks like forced entry
with a metal object.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.640
Some black and white particles.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.893
Want to hand me a hinge lift?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.895
Good eyes.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.905
Who do you keep avoiding?
Ecklie.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.407
Ah, that means
you should answer it.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.910
No, he just wants to yell at me

06:08.410 --> 06:10.412
because I'm late with
the personnel evaluations.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.414
It can wait.

06:12.456 --> 06:13.916
No, it can't.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.919
No one on your team receives
cost-of-living adjustments

06:16.960 --> 06:21.423
until those evaluations
are turned in.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.884
Well, she kind
of has a point.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.929
I do like to take the wife out
to dinner every now and then.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.889
Mm-hmm.

06:28.931 --> 06:31.934
I'll do them as soon
as I get back to the lab.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.937
Last time I saw my sister
was over a year ago.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.397
She was just beginning to show.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.941
She'd gone through
a really bad breakup

06:39.441 --> 06:40.400
and couldn't stop crying

06:40.442 --> 06:42.945
Is the ex the baby's fat her?

06:42.986 --> 06:44.404
I'm not sure.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.448
Well, we need to contact
him regarding Joey

06:46.949 --> 06:48.450
It would be helpfu
I to know his whereabouts.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.953
I only know his first name.
Evan.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.956
But Christina referred to him
as "the jerk. "

06:55.457 --> 06:57.918
They met at a church social
a few years back.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.212
Christina complained he wasn't
very Christian-like.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.464
But that was part of
the attraction, if you ask me.

07:02.506 --> 07:05.926
He was older.
Didn't want to get married

07:05.968 --> 07:10.472
You know, Christina never said
he was the father.

07:10.514 --> 07:11.932
So there were other guys?

07:11.974 --> 07:15.477
No. As far as I knew,
Christina was a prude.

07:15.519 --> 07:18.981
She'd turn red if somebody told
a dirty joke.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.483
I always thought she was
a virgin until...

07:21.525 --> 07:22.985
Until she got pregnant.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.444
Yeah.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.488
Excuse me, have either
of you two seen Grissom?

07:26.530 --> 07:27.489
He's in the house.

07:33.996 --> 07:35.956
Sofia.
Hey, Catherine.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.000
Grissom, Ecklie's
been looking for you.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.543
Is your cell not working?

07:39.543 --> 07:40.961
What are you doing here?

07:41.003 --> 07:44.006
Well, apparently,
I was a CSI, then a detective,

07:44.047 --> 07:45.966
but now I'm a messenger.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.010
You're needed at the lab ASAP.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.970
Why?
I have no idea.

07:50.012 --> 07:53.515
But the undersherriff's
camped out in the break room.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.521
I'll have Greg run down
the gun's serial number.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.981
Nick is covering
the autopsy.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.025
Warrick and I will fin
ish the processing here

08:03.066 --> 08:04.026
and I'll keep
you posted.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.987
Thanks.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.531
What would you do withoutme?

08:14.536 --> 08:15.996
Grissom.

08:16.038 --> 08:16.997
Conrad. Sheriff.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.499
It's always lovely
to see you fellas,

08:18.540 --> 08:20.042
but I'm right in
the middle of a crime scene.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.543
We have a situation, Gil.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.545
Preston Breckman
who's on trial

08:23.587 --> 08:25.047
for the murder
of Joanna Whitson.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.507
Yeah, I know.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.051
She was a friend
of yours. I'm sorry.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.553
I was her godfather.
Grew up with her dad.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.054
Two weeks before
she was murdered

08:33.096 --> 08:34.556
I gave a toast
at her sweet 16.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.558
Well, they say
it's a slam dunk case.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.059
You would think.
We've got an eyewitness

08:38.101 --> 08:39.520
who saw him stab her.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.063
Hair, fiber, even DNA
from the killer's tobacco

08:42.105 --> 08:43.023
indict Breckman.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.566
We got the right guy.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.026
So what am I doing here?

08:46.068 --> 08:49.071
Defense has called
entomologist Mark Thayer

08:49.112 --> 08:50.614
as an expert witness.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.032
He's a gun for hire.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.535
He's gonna say that the
insect activity on the body

08:54.576 --> 08:57.079
proves the defendant was out of
town at the time of the murder.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.581
And you want me to
refute his testimony?

09:01.083 --> 09:02.584
When does he take the stand?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.586
Half an hour.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.047
Look, he's been on the list,

09:07.089 --> 09:09.591
but the D.A. assured me
he was unavailable.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.594
Gil, we need you to listen
to his testimony.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.597
Prosecution may need
your assistance on cross.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.099
I'll do my best.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.560
No mystery here.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.103
Penetrating gunshot wound
to the right temple

09:21.144 --> 09:22.104
killed our Virgin Mary.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.106
I sent the bul let to ballistics.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.108
Virgin Mary?

09:26.608 --> 09:30.112
Hymen's intact which means
she's never had intercourse.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.865
But she gave birth...
caesarean scar

09:32.906 --> 09:35.576
So other than
divine intervention,

09:35.617 --> 09:38.579
how do you explain
this miraculous conception?

09:38.620 --> 09:41.623
Well, the most obvio us
explanation would be frottage.

09:41.665 --> 09:42.624
You mean dry humping?

09:43.125 --> 09:44.084
In Sex Ed,

09:44.126 --> 09:46.879
Nick, they teach t
hat rubbing body parts is safe

09:46.920 --> 09:49.631
But since the hymen's
not a barrier to semen,

09:49.673 --> 09:51.133
there's still a risk of pregnancy,

09:51.175 --> 09:52.593
not to mention STDs.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.637
Right. Sperm meets labia,
all bets are off.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.639
It's all about gravity.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.141
Thanks, Dr. Ruth.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.605
The test fire bullet matches
the evidence bullet.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.649
That confirms the gun found
at the scene was used to kill

10:07.691 --> 10:10.152
this, uh...
Christina Adalian.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.654
You run the serial number?

10:12.696 --> 10:14.114
Yeah, of course.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.408
Anyway, Greg,
your two-inch Colt

10:16.450 --> 10:18.619
was originally purchased
in 1986

10:18.660 --> 10:23.165
by a Mr. Duane McWane
from Henderson.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.666
Good luck.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.126
Thanks.

10:26.168 --> 10:29.171
Well, as you can see, the life
cycle of the black blow fly,

10:29.213 --> 10:31.173
from egg to larva to puparium
to adult,

10:31.673 --> 10:33.133
is like clockwork.

10:33.175 --> 10:36.178
So, to be clear, we can use
the fly's lifecycle

10:36.678 --> 10:38.180
to accurately determine
the precise day

10:38.222 --> 10:39.181
the victim was killed.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.641
That's correct.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.435
The victim was murdered
in a woodsy area near Lake Mead.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.188
In that vicinity, how long would
it take for the blow fly

10:46.230 --> 10:47.689
to lay eggs in Joanna Whitson's
body?

10:47.731 --> 10:49.191
Within minutes of her death.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.192
Is that true?

10:50.234 --> 10:51.193
Mm-hmm.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.695
Doctor, based on your review
of the blow fly activity

10:53.737 --> 10:56.198
as documented by CSI,
can you tell this jury

10:56.240 --> 10:58.200
the exact date Joanna
was murdered?

10:58.242 --> 11:00.202
CSI found puparia on the body,

11:00.244 --> 11:01.662
but no adults.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.706
So that means that the vic
tim had been dead for 15 days.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.209
The body was discovered
November 15.

11:07.251 --> 11:08.710
So based on your analysis,

11:09.211 --> 11:10.712
the victim was killed
November 1st?

11:10.754 --> 11:12.172
That's correct.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.716
Defendant was in Mexico
'til November 3rd.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.177
We think he killed her
on the 4th.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.179
Well, he's still
got to prove his timeline.

11:19.221 --> 11:21.723
Dr. Thayer, this timeline you
suggest- from egg to puparia,

11:21.765 --> 11:23.225
has this been documented?

11:23.267 --> 11:24.685
I documented it myself.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.187
In fact, in preparation
for this trial,

11:27.229 --> 11:30.232
I videotaped a black blow fly
breeding on a pig carcass.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.235
Now, this videotape will
illustrate that the timeline

11:33.735 --> 11:37.239
from egg to puparium is,
in fact, precisely 15 days.

11:39.741 --> 11:42.244
Your Honor, on this video tape,

11:42.286 --> 11:44.204
I have relevant footage

11:44.246 --> 11:45.747
of Dr. Thayer's experiment
With your permission, I would

11:45.789 --> 11:47.249
like to play i t for the jury.
Have you seen this tape?

11:47.291 --> 11:48.709
No. Objection.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.253
Your Honor, the defense
never produced that tape

11:51.295 --> 11:52.713
for our review.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.257
We haven't had the opportunity
to examine its authenticity.

11:55.299 --> 11:56.758
It's not our fau
It. It was never requested

11:56.800 --> 11:58.719
Is that true, Counselor?

11:58.760 --> 12:00.262
The defense is playing games,
Your Honor.

12:00.304 --> 12:01.763
We subpoenaed the expert's
files, reports

12:01.805 --> 12:03.223
and opinions.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.017
But, apparently,
they've conveniently

12:05.058 --> 12:06.727
construed the subpoena
too narrowly.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.520
They're acting
in bad faith, Your Honor,

12:08.562 --> 12:10.397
and cannot expect
this court to usurp...

12:10.439 --> 12:12.274
Your Honor, Your Honor.
If I may..

12:12.316 --> 12:13.233
You may not.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.735
You blindsided the court.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.279
You knew that the ADA
would want to see that tape

12:17.321 --> 12:19.281
and you deliberately
withheld it.

12:19.323 --> 12:21.241
How much time do you need?

12:21.283 --> 12:22.784
We won't know
until we review the video.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.244
Fine.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.787
The defense
is to hand over the tape

12:25.829 --> 12:28.248
and all associated evidence.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.792
The jury is dismissed
until 1:00 p. m. tomorrow.

12:33.795 --> 12:34.796
Send everything
over to the lab.

12:34.838 --> 12:35.797
I'll be there.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.807
Your black-and-white particles

12:45.807 --> 12:47.267
were composed of plagioclase,

12:47.309 --> 12:51.313
biotite, hornblende
and pyroxene.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.773
Diorite granite.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.816
You remember your geology.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.276
Yes!
Wow.

12:56.318 --> 12:59.821
Actually, senior year
I took "Rocks For Jocks. "

12:59.863 --> 13:01.323
I dated the TA.

13:02.824 --> 13:03.283
Lucky guy.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.077
I'm sure you got an "A."

13:05.118 --> 13:06.829
As a matter of fact, I did.

13:07.329 --> 13:08.789
Mm-hmm.

13:08.831 --> 13:09.331
You're married?

13:10.833 --> 13:11.792
Don't flirt.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.336
Anyway, uh, diorite
granite is used

13:14.378 --> 13:16.338
in high end bathroom
vanities.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.091
Was there any recent
construction at the house?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.343
No, I processed the bathroom
and the countertops

13:21.844 --> 13:23.345
for some kind
of plastic laminate.

13:23.387 --> 13:24.847
Made a few calls.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.306
There's only one

13:26.348 --> 13:27.599
slab yard in Clark County

13:27.641 --> 13:28.851
that works with Diorite.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.853
It's on Alonzo Avenue
across the street

13:31.353 --> 13:33.355
from the old theater.

13:35.357 --> 13:38.360
Hey, take it easy
with that, Thassos

13:38.861 --> 13:40.362
It's the last shipment
of the month.

13:40.404 --> 13:41.864
Sorry about that.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.866
Sure, I know Christina.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.367
Dated one of my guys.

13:45.409 --> 13:46.827
Real sweet gal.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.371
Used to bring donuts around
before they broke up.

13:49.413 --> 13:52.875
Her ex happen
to be working today?

13:53.375 --> 13:54.334
Yep.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.378
His name's Evan.

13:58.881 --> 13:59.882
Thank you.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.346
Well, I'm sorry
to hear about Christina,

14:06.388 --> 14:08.891
but we broke it off months ago.
I haven't seen her since

14:08.932 --> 14:11.393
Really?

14:11.894 --> 14:13.395
Is she dating one
of your co-workers?

14:13.896 --> 14:14.897
Huh?

14:15.397 --> 14:18.400
Well, we found marble particles
in her house

14:18.442 --> 14:19.902
and we identified the stone.

14:20.402 --> 14:21.904
It came from this facility.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.865
See, Mr. Peters,

14:24.907 --> 14:27.367
we know that you
and Christina

14:27.409 --> 14:28.911
technically never
had sex, so when you

14:29.411 --> 14:30.412
found out that s
he was pregnant,

14:30.454 --> 14:31.371
that
I'm guessing

14:31.413 --> 14:33.373
you felt that
she cheated on you

14:33.415 --> 14:36.376
How in the hell do you know
about my sex life?

14:36.418 --> 14:38.420
I mean, that had to have made
you really angry, right?

14:38.462 --> 14:39.922
Well, that's why I dumped her.

14:42.424 --> 14:46.428
And fine... I saw her
a couple of days ago.

14:46.470 --> 14:49.431
She called me
in a panic.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.392
Dingbat had locked herself out

14:52.434 --> 14:54.686
with her damn baby
still inside the house.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.897
Thought I had her spare key. I didn't.

14:56.939 --> 15:00.442
She sounded hysterical,
so I went over to help.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.446
Please hurry.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.951
Joey! Joey

15:10.953 --> 15:12.955
You followed her
into the house?

15:12.996 --> 15:14.206
Well, she wanted to talk.

15:14.248 --> 15:16.333
What did
you talk about

15:16.375 --> 15:18.418
All right, get this.

15:18.460 --> 15:23.966
She tried to tell me
that God got her pregnant.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.970
If that's true, the
Big Guy owes me an apology

15:28.011 --> 15:29.471
'cause she was
my girlfriend.

15:29.513 --> 15:30.973
He should have
asked me first.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.933
Why did you lie to us?

15:32.975 --> 15:35.227
Claim that you hadn't se
en her in months?

15:35.269 --> 15:37.479
Well, you guys are
investigating her murder,

15:37.521 --> 15:39.439
and I want to stay out of it.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.984
Well, it's too late
for that, my friend.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.486
We need your DNA.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.988
Open wide.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.494
The day I got married,
I got rid of my gun.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.496
se. The wife didn't want it in the hou

15:54.538 --> 15:55.956
You sell it?

15:55.998 --> 15:58.000
No, I gave it
to my paralegal.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.459
I'm an attorney.

15:59.501 --> 16:00.961
Look, it's just a hand gun,

16:01.003 --> 16:03.505
so I wasn't required
to register the transfer.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.007
What's your paralegal's name

16:05.048 --> 16:06.967
Rita Day.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.468
She left the firm
years ago.

16:08.510 --> 16:11.013
She's a paramedic now
at Emergency Care Ambulance.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.514
You still keep
in touch with her?

16:13.015 --> 16:14.016
I get a card
every Christmas.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.018
All right, well, thanks,
Mr. McWane.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.478
Look, just, just
so you know,

16:18.520 --> 16:20.981
she only got that gun
for her own protection

16:21.023 --> 16:23.525
Whatever you're investigating,
Rita didn't do it.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.530
How is it going?

17:09.570 --> 17:11.573
Well, according
tomyexperience

17:11.615 --> 17:13.534
and all three of
these textbooks,

17:13.575 --> 17:17.579
theP. Reginawould develop
from egg to puparium in 11 days.

17:17.621 --> 17:18.539
Great.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.040
That discounts
Thayer's testimony

17:20.082 --> 17:22.584
and puts Breckman in Vegas
at the time of the homicide.

17:22.626 --> 17:25.587
Yeah, but his demonstration
speaks for itself.

17:26.088 --> 17:30.592
There's no visible puparia f
15 days, just as Thayer asserts.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.344
And jurors might
be more receptive

17:32.386 --> 17:34.054
to video documentation
than books.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.557
The science
in these textbooks is sound,

17:36.598 --> 17:40.602
but thetapeis more than enough
to get reasonable doubt.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.104
Well, there's
no doubt in my mind

17:42.145 --> 17:43.105
that Thayer worked his science

17:43.605 --> 17:44.606
to get the answers
the defense needed.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.567
We just need to know
how he did it.

17:46.608 --> 17:49.111
Could he have altered
one of the variables?

17:49.611 --> 17:50.571
I've reviewed his documentation.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.364
He purchased the pig
from a reputable dealer.

17:52.406 --> 17:54.116
He conducted the experiment
at a private lab

17:54.616 --> 17:56.368
with eyewitnesses,
controlledallvariables

17:56.410 --> 17:58.120
d to replicate the
conditions at Lake Mea

17:58.162 --> 17:59.621
during the time in question.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.582
65 to 73 degrees,

18:01.623 --> 18:03.125
no precipitati
on, on and on.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.627
Can you conduct
your own experiment?

18:05.627 --> 18:07.379
Sure, if the judge
will give me 11 days.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.256
Well, we know
that's not gonna happen.

18:09.298 --> 18:11.717
I'll have Archie
review the video footage.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.136
Maybe he messed
with the time code or something.

18:14.178 --> 18:15.596
I'll let you know.

18:15.637 --> 18:19.641
So I heard that my predecess
or in DNA had all these

18:20.142 --> 18:22.603
you know,
personal hygiene issues.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.646
Well, just for the record,
I'm not like that.

18:24.646 --> 18:27.107
I have always been
very touchy-feely.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.651
I mean, I used to work
in San Francisco, you know.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.154
So... every day we started with hugs.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.614
Uh-huh. Yeah.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.158
Thatmust've been
nice for you. So...

18:36.200 --> 18:37.159
Hey, how about
lunch tomorrow

18:37.659 --> 18:38.619
Just you and me.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.162
Cause, see, I-I figure
that you gotta know

18:40.162 --> 18:41.663
where the bodies are
buried around here.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.625
So to speak.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.919
Is that why you paged me?

18:46.919 --> 18:49.129
No. No, um... I compared

18:49.171 --> 18:53.675
Christina Adalian's DNA
to Baby Joey's, and guess what

18:53.675 --> 18:55.677
Mother and son-
they're not mother and son

18:55.677 --> 18:57.179
At least not genetically speaking.

18:57.679 --> 18:58.639
There's no relation.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.182
And Evan Peters
isn't the father?

19:00.682 --> 19:01.683
Nope.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.686
So assuming that there was no
big baby mix-up at the hospital,

19:04.686 --> 19:07.189
I'm thinking that Christin
a Adalian had to be a surrogate.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.193
Surrogacy...
that would explain her hymen.

19:11.235 --> 19:12.653
Hello.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.154
Her hymen was intact,

19:14.196 --> 19:17.699
which is consistent with
in-vitro fertilization.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.159
lem.
Yeah, but there's one prob

19:19.201 --> 19:21.453
A surrogate's not supp
osed to keep the baby.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.580
A surrogate is supposed to be
a gestational carrier

19:23.622 --> 19:25.707
who returns the child
to the biological parents

19:25.707 --> 19:27.960
after it's been born.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.212
Yeah, thatisa problem.

19:36.718 --> 19:37.678
Hey, Gris.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.221
I reviewed your videotapes.

19:39.721 --> 19:42.724
Checked for insertions,
deletions, omissions.

19:42.724 --> 19:43.976
They're all authentic.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.602
You're certa
Oh, yeah.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.187
I de-interlaced the video,

19:47.229 --> 19:49.231
checked the head switching,
the HBI-VBI

19:49.273 --> 19:50.232
looked for in-out signals.

19:50.732 --> 19:51.733
The tapes are clean.

19:51.733 --> 19:52.693
Sorry.

19:52.734 --> 19:53.735
Did you blow up the frames?

19:54.236 --> 19:54.736
Yeah.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.238
One every six hours.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.240
They're in Layout,
when you're ready. Okay.

19:58.282 --> 19:59.241
Oh, hi, Archie.

19:59.283 --> 20:00.742
Hey.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.744
I just finished your eval.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.204
And?

20:04.246 --> 20:07.249
In the comments section, I noted
that if you had my job,

20:07.291 --> 20:09.251
late. these evaluati ons wouldn't be

20:09.293 --> 20:11.211
Thank you.

20:11.253 --> 20:15.257
So I understand that you're
going up against Mark Thayer.

20:15.299 --> 20:16.717
The guy's an ass.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.760
He used to be a
competent scientist.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.264
We actually co-authored a paper
together ten years ago.

20:22.306 --> 20:24.516
I believe greed ha
s gotten in his way.

20:24.558 --> 20:26.768
Well, I've seen him
on the stand.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.770
He manipulates evidence.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.230
He manipulates people.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.233
The public assumes
that scientists are ethical,

20:33.275 --> 20:35.777
but many of us are no better
than politicians, evidently.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.280
So do you think that Thayer

20:38.780 --> 20:40.782
is presenting the jury
with faulty forensics?

20:40.782 --> 20:43.785
I know he is.
I just don't know how.

20:43.785 --> 20:46.288
Videotapes are clean.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.791
The science appears sound.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.293
How's your case going?

20:51.793 --> 20:54.796
Huh. I don't know who kill
ed Christina Adalian,

20:54.796 --> 20:56.757
I don't know
how she got pregnant

20:56.798 --> 21:01.803
s. and I don't know the identity
ofthe baby's biological parent

21:01.803 --> 21:03.305
It's always good to know
what youdon'tknow.

21:08.519 --> 21:10.020
Sure, I know Duane.
He's a good boss.

21:10.062 --> 21:11.772
I just hated
being cooped up

21:11.813 --> 21:13.649
in an office building
all day.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.526
n He claims he g ave you his gu

21:15.567 --> 21:17.027
several years back

21:17.069 --> 21:18.487
Yeah, sure. Why?

21:18.529 --> 21:21.532
It was recently used in a homicide.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.534
Damn.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.494
Well, I'm sorry.

21:25.536 --> 21:28.539
So, the gun's no lon
ger in your possession

21:28.580 --> 21:30.290
Lost the Colt in a poker
game years ago.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.042
Do you remember
who you lost it to

21:32.084 --> 21:33.544
I was drunk as a skunk.

21:33.585 --> 21:34.795
Met these guys at a bar.

21:34.837 --> 21:36.004
Lost a small fortune

21:36.046 --> 21:37.548
trying to keep up
with their raises.

21:38.048 --> 21:40.050
Can you tell me anything
about the guy who won the gun?

21:40.551 --> 21:43.303
Well, he's an older guy,
at least 50.

21:43.345 --> 21:46.056
I remember guys
were calling him "Cy,"

21:46.098 --> 21:47.057
but that wasn't
his real name.

21:47.558 --> 21:49.059
He had this large mole
between his eyes.

21:49.101 --> 21:51.520
"Cy," short
for "Cyclops

21:51.562 --> 21:54.064
Yeah. I swear I thought
that thing was winking at me.

21:54.106 --> 21:55.065
Thanks for your help.

21:55.107 --> 21:56.066
No problem.

22:03.574 --> 22:05.033
Oh, ducks.

22:05.075 --> 22:06.535
That's a new decorating choice

22:06.577 --> 22:12.583
I now have to share this office
with the day shift supervisor.

22:12.624 --> 22:15.085
She's got some kind of thing
for waterfowl.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.587
What's up?

22:17.087 --> 22:21.091
Warrick and I tracked down
Joey Adalian's birth certificate.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.093
Christina's named
as the mother,

22:23.135 --> 22:24.094
father's unknown.

22:24.595 --> 22:27.097
We also found another
document in her desk.

22:27.139 --> 22:29.600
It's a registration form
for an organization

22:29.641 --> 22:31.560
called Project Sunflower.

22:31.602 --> 22:33.604
They find mothers
for abandoned embryos.

22:34.104 --> 22:36.565
s?
Abandoned embryo

22:36.607 --> 22:38.567
According to the literature,

22:38.609 --> 22:41.612
Project Sunflower believes that
every fertilized egg or embryo

22:41.653 --> 22:44.865
is a baby from the moment it's
created in a laboratory dish.

22:44.907 --> 22:48.118
Fertility clinics freeze
fertilized eggs for their clients

22:48.619 --> 22:50.579
undergoing
in-vitro fertilization.

22:50.621 --> 22:54.124
Often, the clinics freeze more
eggs than they ultimately need.

22:54.166 --> 23:01.131
And Sunflower tries
to find women willing

23:01.173 --> 23:03.133
to gestate
and raise the leftovers?

23:03.175 --> 23:05.093
Uh-huh.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.888
Project Sunflower promotes
itself as doing God's work

23:07.930 --> 23:10.641
I knew a stripper who claimed
the exact same thing.

23:13.143 --> 23:15.646
So, is there any chance
that you have a record

23:15.687 --> 23:17.105
of the baby's
biological parents

23:17.147 --> 23:20.651
Not yet. But I do have
an address for Sunflower's

23:20.692 --> 23:22.611
local chapter.

23:22.653 --> 23:25.113
It's such a tragedy.

23:25.155 --> 23:28.158
There are over 400,000 embryos
currently in cryobank storage

23:28.200 --> 23:30.118
in the United States.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.164
Pre-born children
suspended in time.

23:34.665 --> 23:37.668
If I understand your program
correctly,

23:38.168 --> 23:41.171
you take these embryos
and you place them

23:41.213 --> 23:44.132
in available wombs.

23:44.174 --> 23:46.677
We seek out special
unselfish women

23:46.718 --> 23:48.136
who are prepared
to adopt

23:48.178 --> 23:50.681
at the embryonic stage
of development.

23:50.722 --> 23:53.183
We believe that
the soul is infused

23:53.225 --> 23:55.143
when sperm meets egg.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.645
That's when life begins.

23:56.687 --> 24:01.650
Are you aware
that throughout much of history,

24:01.692 --> 24:04.695
life the official churc h
position held th at a child's

24:04.736 --> 24:07.698
begins when the mother
first becomes aware of movement?

24:07.739 --> 24:09.658
Oh, that's your opinion.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.202
In the 16th century,
the Pope proclaimed

24:12.703 --> 24:15.706
that embryos less than 40 days
old are not human.

24:15.747 --> 24:16.707
That is not my opinion.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.711
You've had an abortion,
Miss Willows?

24:20.752 --> 24:24.214
Huh. No. Thank God

24:24.715 --> 24:26.717
I decided
not to have one.

24:27.217 --> 24:30.721
But we are not talking about me,
Dr. Ryan.

24:30.762 --> 24:31.722
Are you a medical doctor?

24:32.222 --> 24:34.725
I don't care
for that insinuation.

24:34.766 --> 24:36.727
Oh, it's just a question

24:37.227 --> 24:38.729
I take i t that's a no?

24:39.229 --> 24:41.231
I have a very busy afternoon.

24:41.273 --> 24:43.233
What exactly can I do for you?

24:43.275 --> 24:45.694
I have a question.

24:45.736 --> 24:49.239
Do the biological parents
get to meet the embryo adopters?

24:49.281 --> 24:50.240
Of course.

24:50.741 --> 24:53.702
If you are going to give
up your pre-born child,

24:53.744 --> 24:56.246
you'd want to approve of his
or her future parents, right?

24:56.747 --> 24:58.999
Uh, one of you r special women,

24:59.041 --> 25:01.627
Christina Adalia n, was murdered.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.962
We're go ing to need the names

25:04.004 --> 25:06.256
of her son's biological parents.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.763
I am, I'm sorry to hear
about Christina.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.223
I conducted her

25:14.264 --> 25:16.266
intake interview personally.

25:16.308 --> 25:17.267
A lovely woman.

25:18.769 --> 25:21.772
Our records are confidential.

25:21.813 --> 25:22.731
I'm sorry.

25:22.773 --> 25:25.275
We can get a court order.

25:25.317 --> 25:27.277
So get one.

26:31.341 --> 26:33.844
Ecklie said the tape
might be authentic.

26:33.886 --> 26:35.804
so.
Seems

26:35.846 --> 26:38.348
Grissom, I don't know
what to do:

26:38.390 --> 26:40.851
instruct the DA to offer
second degree?

26:40.893 --> 26:42.311
I mean, I can't risk

26:42.352 --> 26:44.354
letting this guy back
back out on the street

26:44.396 --> 26:46.857
but to plead this out
after what he did

26:46.899 --> 26:49.818
to someone I loved

26:49.860 --> 26:52.321
I need some guidance here.

26:52.362 --> 26:55.365
I can't tell you
what to do, Sheriff

26:55.407 --> 26:57.326
No, you can't.

26:57.367 --> 26:59.369
But you can tell me
where we stand.

26:59.411 --> 27:00.871
What are you doing?

27:00.913 --> 27:02.372
Circling blowflies

27:02.414 --> 27:03.373
Why?

27:05.375 --> 27:08.128
'Cause dead flies tell no lies

27:08.170 --> 27:10.881
The signature
is definitely hers,

27:11.381 --> 27:14.384
and you're right, she
wrote the note under duress.

27:14.426 --> 27:16.345
Have you been able
to analyze the ink?

27:16.386 --> 27:20.891
Thin-layer chromatography tells
us the red dye is consistent

27:20.933 --> 27:23.352
with a standard Coda pen.

27:23.393 --> 27:26.396
But find the pen. I should
be able to match it to the note.

27:26.438 --> 27:28.148
You can match ink?

27:28.190 --> 27:29.900
I can match its flow.

27:34.905 --> 27:37.407
What do you notice
about the ink?

27:37.449 --> 27:40.369
Uneven distribution?

27:40.410 --> 27:41.870
The pen sock et that holds

27:41.912 --> 27:42.913
the ball in pl ace was askew.

27:46.416 --> 27:48.919
The cockeyed socket caused
ink disruption

27:48.961 --> 27:50.921
as it flowed down to the paper.

27:50.963 --> 27:53.423
A damaged socket is quite common

27:53.465 --> 27:55.884
in cheap writing
instruments.

27:55.926 --> 27:58.679
Lucky for us, the uneven
distribution of the ink

27:58.720 --> 28:01.431
will be uniq ue to the
pen tha t wrote the note

28:01.473 --> 28:04.434
Hey, Professor. Looking good.

28:04.476 --> 28:06.395
You know how sometimes

28:06.436 --> 28:08.438
fact is stranger than fiction?

28:08.480 --> 28:09.898
Yeah.

28:09.940 --> 28:11.400
Brass got the court order

28:11.441 --> 28:13.694
for Joey Adalian's
biological parents

28:13.735 --> 28:15.946
a Kenli and Dan Johnson
in Seven Hills

28:16.446 --> 28:18.407
will. We also fo und Christina's

28:18.448 --> 28:20.951
Guess who she named
as Joey's guardians?

28:20.993 --> 28:21.952
Kenli and Dan?

28:23.954 --> 28:25.414
Excuse me.

28:25.455 --> 28:26.915
You're right.

28:26.957 --> 28:29.960
A single woman adopts
a leftover embryo

28:30.460 --> 28:32.421
from an
infertile couple

28:32.462 --> 28:34.464
and upon her death agrees
to give the child back

28:34.965 --> 28:36.425
to its biological parents?

28:36.466 --> 28:38.927
Who gave up the embryo
in the first place.

28:38.969 --> 28:41.972
You happen to have an address
for this Mr. and Mrs. Johnson?

28:42.014 --> 28:42.973
Let's go.

28:45.976 --> 28:47.978
Oh, hey. How's
The Way of The Gun?

28:48.020 --> 28:49.479
It was lost
in a poker game.

28:49.521 --> 28:50.939
Did you get
the winner's name?

28:50.981 --> 28:53.984
No, but he has a large mole
between his eyes

28:54.026 --> 28:55.485
and his nickname's "Cy. "

28:55.527 --> 28:56.945
That's all I got,
so sorry.

28:56.987 --> 28:59.490
Greg, never apolog
ize for doing your job

29:01.992 --> 29:03.452
Okay.

29:03.494 --> 29:06.497
Dan and I were desperate

29:06.538 --> 29:07.956
to have a child,

29:07.998 --> 29:10.501
and the doctor said ou
r only hope was in-vitro

29:10.542 --> 29:12.503
Where is your
husband now?

29:13.003 --> 29:14.463
He

29:14.505 --> 29:16.465
He passed away.

29:16.507 --> 29:18.509
Are you sure I can't
get you something?

29:18.550 --> 29:20.969
No, thank you.

29:21.011 --> 29:23.514
Thank you, Mom
You're welcome, baby.

29:23.555 --> 29:26.475
It's been almost a year.

29:26.517 --> 29:28.018
We were coming home
from a movie

29:28.060 --> 29:28.977
when we were
broadsided

29:29.019 --> 29:32.022
The guy kept goi ng and Danny

29:32.523 --> 29:34.483
never woke up.

29:34.525 --> 29:38.028
I'm so sorry.

29:38.070 --> 29:41.490
Can I ask you...

29:41.532 --> 29:43.992
did you ever
conceive a child?

29:44.034 --> 29:46.537
Well, my body ke
pt rejecting the procedure,

29:46.578 --> 29:48.038
so we trie d three times

29:48.539 --> 29:50.499
and then calle d it quits.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.543
Had you ever considered
a surrogate?

29:52.584 --> 29:54.503
It's very expensive.

29:54.545 --> 29:58.549
Danny just was never comfortable
with the notion that...

29:58.590 --> 30:01.802
Well, we just figured
we weren't meant to be parents

30:01.844 --> 30:05.055
And that's why you decid
ed to give away your embryos.

30:05.097 --> 30:07.015
Yeah, I had seen a flyer
at the clinic.

30:07.057 --> 30:10.561
Are you aware that one of those
embryos was carried to term?

30:10.602 --> 30:13.522
Dan and I pre-screen ed Christina,

30:13.564 --> 30:17.067
and we went to see
Joey and her once a month.

30:17.568 --> 30:20.529
So that' s why when I got your call,

30:20.571 --> 30:23.532
I just don't know who'd
want to hurt such a sweet girl.

30:23.574 --> 30:27.578
According to Christina's wil
you were named Joey's guardian

30:28.078 --> 30:30.080
Yes, that was very important
to Christina.

30:30.122 --> 30:31.039
She's not close

30:31.081 --> 30:32.541
with any of her family,

30:32.583 --> 30:35.544
so I've already ca lled
Child Services, and as soon

30:35.586 --> 30:39.089
the lawyer reviews the will,
I'm supposed to pick him up.

30:39.131 --> 30:40.090
Well, if you don't mind,

30:40.591 --> 30:42.551
I'd like your permission

30:42.593 --> 30:44.595
to take a look
at the clothing that you wore

30:44.636 --> 30:46.054
two nights ago.

30:46.096 --> 30:48.599
You can't possibly think
I had anything

30:48.640 --> 30:50.100
to do with this?

30:50.601 --> 30:52.603
It's protocol. The victim
was shot at close range.

31:07.618 --> 31:09.578
I wore the white blouse.

31:09.620 --> 31:12.122
We're going to need to take

31:12.164 --> 31:14.583
all the laundry
back to our lab.

31:14.625 --> 31:17.586
You never found the
gu y who killed my husband,

31:17.628 --> 31:20.631
and now you're wasting t
ime looking at my dirty clothes.

31:20.672 --> 31:22.633
That's fine.

31:22.674 --> 31:24.635
Take it.

32:04.132 --> 32:06.593
Why did the fly, fly?

32:06.635 --> 32:09.596
Because the spider spied her.

32:09.638 --> 32:11.640
Catherine's daughter told
me that when she was three.

32:11.682 --> 32:13.642
Do we have results

32:22.651 --> 32:23.652
Thank you.

32:26.655 --> 32:28.615
Oh, hey, Ecklie
said you wanted to see me.

32:28.657 --> 32:32.661
Yeah. A Dr. Ryan called and said
that you verbally harassed her?

32:32.703 --> 32:36.165
I met Dr. Ryan in the course
of my investigation.

32:36.206 --> 32:39.626
She runs an organization called
Project Sunflower.

32:39.668 --> 32:43.172
Philosophically, I completely
disagree with the organization.

32:43.213 --> 32:45.674
Perhaps I expressed myself

32:45.716 --> 32:47.676
Which means?

32:48.177 --> 32:49.636
I'm pro-choice.

32:49.678 --> 32:51.138
I'm in favor
of stem cell research.

32:51.180 --> 32:53.182
I'm sorry she felt harassed,
but my comments were

32:53.223 --> 32:54.141
in response to her statements.

32:54.183 --> 32:55.684
I don't think I was out of line.

32:56.185 --> 32:59.188
You should have cited
Leviticus 17:11.

32:59.229 --> 33:01.690
"The life of the flesh
is in the blood. "

33:01.732 --> 33:04.151
Taken literally,
life doesn't begin

33:04.193 --> 33:06.695
when the sperm meets the egg,
but 18 days later.

33:06.737 --> 33:08.197
When the embryo is infused
with blood.

33:08.238 --> 33:09.698
Is that your position?

33:10.199 --> 33:12.201
Well, if I were speaking
with a woman

33:12.242 --> 33:14.161
who prefers theology
to science,

33:14.203 --> 33:16.205
it's a position
she'd find tough to refute

33:16.705 --> 33:19.708
So are we having a philosophical
discussion here,

33:19.750 --> 33:21.210
or am I being reprimanded?

33:21.251 --> 33:22.711
I don't know.

33:23.212 --> 33:24.213
I got to go to court.

33:27.216 --> 33:28.675
What?

33:28.717 --> 33:30.177
Your white blouse.

33:30.219 --> 33:31.220
The results are printing.

33:37.726 --> 33:40.187
It seems like
you and Grissom

33:40.229 --> 33:41.730
were having a fairly
intense conversation.

33:41.772 --> 33:42.689
Can I ask...?

33:42.731 --> 33:44.233
Tell me about the blouse,
please.

33:45.734 --> 33:50.239
I ran the S.E.M. over
the adhesive disks

33:50.280 --> 33:53.242
and confirmed
gunshot residue.

33:53.742 --> 33:56.245
You found clothing in a laundry basket

33:56.286 --> 33:58.747
that tested positive
for gunshot residue.

33:59.248 --> 34:00.249
So what?

34:00.749 --> 34:01.750
That doesn't mean my client
killed anyone.

34:02.251 --> 34:04.253
It proves that she fired a gun,
Carol.

34:04.294 --> 34:05.712
I've never fired a gun.

34:05.754 --> 34:07.714
I've never even touched a gun.

34:07.756 --> 34:10.759
Catherine, I'm sorry,
but if I understand

34:10.801 --> 34:13.762
your forensics,
the GSR test does not, in fact,

34:14.263 --> 34:16.223
confirm that she fired a gun.

34:16.264 --> 34:19.268
I mean, it's possible she rubbed
up against someone who did.

34:19.768 --> 34:20.726
Theoretically.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.772
I cared about Christina.

34:23.813 --> 34:26.733
I'm sure that you did.

34:26.775 --> 34:31.280
But looking into Joey's eyes
and seeing your husband,

34:31.321 --> 34:34.241
must've torn you
up inside.

34:34.283 --> 34:36.784
And the only person standing
between you and your baby

34:36.827 --> 34:38.745
was the victim.

34:38.786 --> 34:40.789
Okay, don't respond to that.

34:43.292 --> 34:45.793
When was the last time you
actually saw Christina?

34:49.297 --> 34:52.050
Two days ago. I took
them to lunch.

34:52.092 --> 34:54.803
What were you doing
two nights ago,

34:54.844 --> 34:56.804
around 11:00 p.m.?

34:56.847 --> 34:58.807
I was home all night.

34:59.308 --> 35:01.268
Can anyone verify that?

35:01.310 --> 35:05.814
My mom lives with me,
but she wasn't home.

35:05.856 --> 35:07.816
That's gin rummy night.

35:18.827 --> 35:20.287
What's going on in there?

35:20.329 --> 35:22.331
Kenli had nothing to do
with this.

35:22.372 --> 35:24.791
Mrs. Walkey, I need your help.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.835
Your daughter claims
that two night ago

35:26.877 --> 35:28.295
she was home

35:28.337 --> 35:29.338
watching television.

35:29.838 --> 35:30.797
Can you confirm that?

35:30.839 --> 35:33.842
Well, of course. I was with her.

35:35.344 --> 35:36.345
Thank you.

36:00.369 --> 36:02.871
If you had to guess,
what's Kenli's dress size?

36:02.913 --> 36:04.832
Four, maybe six.

36:04.873 --> 36:06.875
I found blood spatter

36:06.917 --> 36:08.877
on this blouse. Size 12.

36:09.378 --> 36:14.383
There're two women that live
at that house.

36:14.424 --> 36:17.344
Only one is a size 12.

36:17.386 --> 36:18.887
I don't need an attorney

36:19.388 --> 36:20.347
I've done nothing wrong.

36:20.389 --> 36:23.392
Would you mind emptying
the contents of your purse?

36:23.433 --> 36:25.894
First you go after Kenli,
now me.

36:25.936 --> 36:28.355
A few hours ago, you guys
were saying

36:28.397 --> 36:30.899
there was gunshot powder
on Kenli's blouse.

36:30.941 --> 36:32.359
You make a mistake?

36:32.401 --> 36:34.903
No, it was probably transferred
from your blouse,

36:34.945 --> 36:36.864
the one that you wore
that night.

36:36.905 --> 36:38.407
I have a warrant to search
your person

36:38.448 --> 36:39.366
and your home.

36:39.408 --> 36:40.409
Please empty the contents

36:40.909 --> 36:42.411
of your purse onto the table.

36:54.423 --> 36:58.927
A red Coda pen.

36:59.928 --> 37:01.388
Joey...

37:01.430 --> 37:03.932
is...

37:04.433 --> 37:06.935
better off...

37:07.436 --> 37:08.437
...without me.

37:16.445 --> 37:19.448
Please don't do this.

37:19.490 --> 37:20.949
Oh, God, please.

37:20.991 --> 37:23.702
Sign it.

37:23.744 --> 37:26.413
Sign it!

37:26.455 --> 37:28.457
You knew that her sister
was coming for a visit,

37:28.957 --> 37:30.918
so the baby
would be okay.

37:30.959 --> 37:33.337
You killed her
and then staged the scene.

38:03.492 --> 38:07.496
You have a wild imagination,
Ms. Willows.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.503
Is this your husband?

38:14.545 --> 38:16.964
Arnold.

38:17.005 --> 38:19.508
He passed away.

38:20.008 --> 38:21.468
Two years ago, May.

38:21.510 --> 38:22.970
He looks like a poker player.

38:23.011 --> 38:25.514
You can tell that
from his photo?

38:25.556 --> 38:27.975
Actually, it's...

38:28.016 --> 38:32.521
the mole between his eyes
that's his tell.

38:32.563 --> 38:35.023
Why are we talking about Arnie?

38:35.065 --> 38:36.984
Because you used his gun.

38:37.025 --> 38:38.527
The gun he won in a poker game.

38:43.031 --> 38:45.033
Are you going to put me in jail?

38:45.075 --> 38:48.495
That's how it works.

38:48.537 --> 38:52.541
And the baby- he goes
with Kenli, right?

38:52.583 --> 38:56.545
I'm sure that Child Services
will follow

38:57.045 --> 38:59.047
the dictates
of Christina's will.

38:59.089 --> 39:01.049
Then it was all worth it.

39:03.051 --> 39:05.512
My baby has her baby.

39:05.554 --> 39:07.055
That's all that really matters

39:08.557 --> 39:10.058
Did you ever consider

39:10.559 --> 39:13.061
that Christina Adalian
is somebody's baby?

39:13.103 --> 39:15.314
We each protect our own.

39:15.355 --> 39:17.566
That's how it's done.

39:19.067 --> 39:23.572
Officer, would you please escort
Mrs. Walkey to lockup?

39:33.582 --> 39:37.336
As you can see, on day 14-
plenty of larvae,

39:37.377 --> 39:41.048
commonly known as maggots,
but no puparia.

39:41.089 --> 39:44.092
a Finally on day 15,
you'll notice the pupari

39:44.134 --> 39:45.552
swimming in the brown liquid.

39:45.594 --> 39:49.097
Based on that evidence,
I can reliably conclude

39:49.139 --> 39:51.850
that Joanna Whitson was
killed on November 1st

39:51.892 --> 39:54.603
You're absolutely certain
of that timeline?

39:54.645 --> 39:55.604
Yes.

39:56.104 --> 39:58.607
Thank you. No further questions.

39:58.649 --> 40:00.567
Your witness.

40:00.609 --> 40:02.611
We have no questions
for Dr. Thayer.

40:03.111 --> 40:05.614
But I now call to the stand
Dr. Gil Grissom

40:05.656 --> 40:07.074
as a rebuttal
expert witness.

40:07.115 --> 40:08.075
Dr. Thayer, you're dismissed

40:08.116 --> 40:11.119
Dr. Grissom, please approach
the stand to be sworn in.

40:14.623 --> 40:16.083
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear

40:16.124 --> 40:18.627
to tell the truth, the whole
truth, so help you God?

40:18.669 --> 40:19.878
I certainly do.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.129
You may be seated.

40:23.632 --> 40:25.592
Dr. Grissom,

40:25.634 --> 40:28.136
you've had a chance to review
Dr. Thayer's tape

40:28.178 --> 40:30.138
and associated evidence,
is that correct?

40:30.180 --> 40:31.098
Yes.

40:31.139 --> 40:33.392
Do you agree with his finding

40:33.433 --> 40:35.602
that Joanna Whitson
was murdered

40:35.644 --> 40:38.647
15 days before her body
was discovered?

40:38.689 --> 40:40.107
No.

40:40.148 --> 40:41.108
Can you please elaborate?

40:41.149 --> 40:44.153
Our crime lab analyzed
fly larvae

40:44.194 --> 40:46.113
that was taken
from the pig

40:46.155 --> 40:49.116
used by Dr. Thayer
in his demonstration.

40:49.158 --> 40:54.163
Apparently, they digested
dimethyldithiophosphate

40:54.204 --> 40:56.123
and T-mulz Light Aromatic.

40:56.165 --> 40:59.168
A toxin commonly known
as malathion?

40:59.209 --> 41:00.627
Yes.

41:00.669 --> 41:04.173
I believe the malathion was
sprayed onto the pig's skin.

41:09.678 --> 41:12.139
How would malathion affect
a fly's life cycle?

41:12.181 --> 41:15.184
It would delay the time it takes
for puparia to appear.

41:15.225 --> 41:18.187
Specifically, the malathion
would delay oviposition.

41:18.687 --> 41:19.188
Oviposition?

41:19.688 --> 41:20.647
Laying eggs.

41:20.689 --> 41:23.150
Without malathion, adult flies

41:23.192 --> 41:25.694
would immediately lay
new eggs on the pig's flesh.

41:25.736 --> 41:27.196
But with malathion,

41:27.696 --> 41:30.199
oviposition would be delayed
up to four days.

41:30.699 --> 41:34.953
A four-day delay would mean
that Joanna Whitson died

41:34.995 --> 41:39.208
on November 4th, not November 1st,
is that correct?

41:39.249 --> 41:40.667
Yes.

41:40.709 --> 41:42.211
Is there any scientific
rationale

41:42.252 --> 41:43.712
for spraying a pig
with malathion

41:44.213 --> 41:45.214
before documenting
a fly's life cycle?

41:45.255 --> 41:47.174
Objection.
Overruled.

41:47.216 --> 41:50.219
The only rationale I can think
of would be jury manipulation.

41:50.719 --> 41:53.222
Every entomologist knows
that early oviposition

41:53.722 --> 41:54.681
is undetectable

41:54.723 --> 41:57.726
because flies lay
their first round of eggs

41:57.768 --> 42:00.187
inside body openings.

42:00.229 --> 42:01.730
Anyone reviewing
the tape would assume

42:02.231 --> 42:04.733
that the eggs were being laid,
when in fact they were not.

42:04.775 --> 42:07.236
If our lab had n
ot tested the larva

42:07.736 --> 42:10.739
for toxins,
we would never have known that.

42:10.781 --> 42:12.741
Nor would the jury.

42:13.242 --> 42:15.744
Thank you. No further questions.

42:15.786 --> 42:18.705
Counselor, your witness.

42:18.747 --> 42:20.749
Uh, we have no questions
at this time.

42:21.250 --> 42:23.752
Well, in that case,
we are adjourned

42:24.253 --> 42:25.254
until 9:00 a. m.
tomorrow morning.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.720
I want to talk to you.

42:33.762 --> 42:35.264
I have nothing to say to you.

42:35.305 --> 42:36.765
You impugned my character.

42:37.266 --> 42:38.767
What character Uh,
excuse me, Dr. Thayer.

42:38.809 --> 42:40.727
What the hell do you want?

42:40.769 --> 42:44.773
Well, to inform you that you
have the right to remain silent.

42:45.274 --> 42:47.025
The D.A.'s filing
charges for perjury

42:47.067 --> 42:48.777
Oh, my God...
and obstruction of justice

42:48.819 --> 42:50.279
We won't be accepting
a plea.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.280
This is all your fault.

42:51.321 --> 42:53.282
I hope so.

42:56.785 --> 42:58.245
Grissom.

42:58.287 --> 43:00.289
Great work up there.

43:00.789 --> 43:01.790
Actually, the work
was done in the lab.

43:02.291 --> 43:03.250
When I took this job,

43:03.292 --> 43:05.294
I heard
a lot of things about you.

43:05.794 --> 43:08.297
If you ever need a favor,
if I can help you in any way...

43:08.338 --> 43:11.258
You know Sheriff , you could help me.

43:11.300 --> 43:14.303
I'm late delivering my team's
personnel evaluations.

43:14.344 --> 43:15.762
I'll tell Ecklie.

43:15.804 --> 43:18.307
He'll backdate your
cost-of-living adjustments.

43:18.348 --> 43:19.766
Thank you.

43:19.808 --> 43:22.269
So, Grissom, I'm not sure
of your ambitions,

43:22.311 --> 43:24.813
but if you're interested in
taking on more responsibility,

43:24.855 --> 43:26.815
maybe a promotion,
I'd be glad to pass...

43:27.316 --> 43:28.775
You know, Oscar
Wilde once said,

43:28.817 --> 43:31.320
"Ambition is the I
ast refuge of failure.

43:31.361 --> 43:33.322
I'm fine. Thanks.
