00:02.171 --> 00:03.401
Freya: You will all fall...

00:03.403 --> 00:05.283
one by friend, one by foe,

00:05.313 --> 00:06.755
one by family.

00:06.785 --> 00:07.723
Rebekah: When I am buried,

00:07.753 --> 00:10.735
the family part of the prophecy
will be over. Elijah, do it!

00:10.765 --> 00:12.328
(Gasps)

00:13.273 --> 00:16.548
Stefan Salvatore,
welcome to New Orleans.

00:19.830 --> 00:22.041
That, that is the mark of the Phoenix.

00:22.071 --> 00:23.354
- You've seen this before.
- Tell me

00:23.356 --> 00:24.609
you have not been careless enough

00:24.639 --> 00:26.312
to make an enemy of Rayna Cruz.

00:26.342 --> 00:28.293
Why do you think I'm here, Klaus?

00:28.332 --> 00:31.284
The missing ingredient is the
heart of an unsired vampire.

00:31.314 --> 00:33.915
They need my heart.
Or one that's identical to it.

00:33.945 --> 00:34.854
Jackson.

00:34.884 --> 00:36.500
Then maybe you can tell Aya

00:36.502 --> 00:38.336
to let me bring back Kol permanently.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.755
Kol's been dead. He can stay
dead a little while longer.

00:40.757 --> 00:42.629
But my life could end at any minute.

00:42.659 --> 00:44.981
All I wanted was to delink
my friends from Klaus.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.232
Now I finally can.

00:46.262 --> 00:47.628
The bullets are white oak.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.995
My beloved brother suffers in a box.

00:50.025 --> 00:51.471
So I will end his suffering

00:51.501 --> 00:54.274
by ending you, his sire.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.778
I've come to make a proposal.

00:55.808 --> 00:58.639
I suspect our world
can change with a bang.

01:01.477 --> 01:04.144
- (Crickets chirping)
- (Old-timey French song playing)

01:06.519 --> 01:08.616
Aurora: I can see why
my brother liked you.

01:09.150 --> 01:11.786
Such the strong, silent type.

01:11.788 --> 01:13.393
This isn't silence, Aurora.

01:13.423 --> 01:14.418
It's patience.

01:14.448 --> 01:18.107
Give me what's in your hand,
and I'll give you what you want.

01:18.613 --> 01:22.013
But you see, Aya, what I want, I have.

01:22.591 --> 01:24.348
A weapon that can kill the unkillable

01:24.350 --> 01:26.400
and make the Mikaelsons
suffer nearly as much pain

01:26.402 --> 01:28.112
as they've made me suffer.

01:28.142 --> 01:31.522
Unfortunately, Elijah is one
of your targets and my sire.

01:31.524 --> 01:33.858
If you kill him, I die, too.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.331
As would my brother,

01:35.361 --> 01:37.728
who drowns endlessly at
the bottom of the ocean.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.336
Killing Elijah is the only
mercy I can offer him, Aya.

01:41.770 --> 01:43.951
But what if there was another way?

01:45.392 --> 01:47.571
Help me sever the link
between the Originals

01:47.573 --> 01:50.741
and their sire lines...

01:51.109 --> 01:53.279
And maybe I'll show it to you.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.306
You know, Aya, when all this is over,

02:00.336 --> 02:01.919
we should be better friends.

02:02.384 --> 02:05.806
When this is over, we
can be anything we want.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.637
Now...

02:08.657 --> 02:11.595
come and lie over here.

02:11.597 --> 02:13.681
Cynthia will guide you.

02:19.346 --> 02:20.771
This had better work.

02:23.068 --> 02:24.608
Close your eyes.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.698
(Chanting in foreign language)

02:36.455 --> 02:37.454
(Squeals) Tristan!

02:37.456 --> 02:38.710
Sister.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.763
(Both laugh)

02:40.793 --> 02:43.377
Oh, I missed you.

02:51.655 --> 02:53.514
Tristan, I'm so sorry.

02:53.544 --> 02:54.688
I failed you.

02:54.690 --> 02:56.140
Shh, darling. It's all right.

02:56.142 --> 02:57.641
It's all right.

02:57.643 --> 03:00.361
My circumstances have
been beyond horrific,

03:00.363 --> 03:02.480
but a light has appeared.

03:02.941 --> 03:04.648
Aya hasn't forsaken me.

03:04.650 --> 03:07.225
Her witches made this place.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.637
Drew my mind here.

03:08.667 --> 03:11.007
Though my body drowns,

03:11.037 --> 03:13.741
here, I can read and play music

03:13.743 --> 03:15.100
and see you.

03:15.130 --> 03:16.269
(Chuckles)

03:17.215 --> 03:18.497
Tristan...

03:19.465 --> 03:23.501
If I have to burn the world
to drain the oceans,

03:23.951 --> 03:25.669
I will find you.

03:27.244 --> 03:29.590
Of this, I have no doubt.

03:31.236 --> 03:32.754
(Chuckles)

03:33.613 --> 03:36.847
But first, I have a little show
in store for you today.

03:36.849 --> 03:40.684
A comedy. Or a tragedy,
depending on who you are.

03:43.010 --> 03:46.524
And you and I have front row seats.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.670
You daggered Rebekah?

03:53.700 --> 03:55.070
And you're just telling me now?

03:55.100 --> 03:57.718
She sacrificed herself
in order to protect us.

03:57.748 --> 04:00.671
And to protect her, I've told
Niklaus and I'm telling you.

04:01.296 --> 04:03.045
No one would have known
Rebekah's whereabouts

04:03.075 --> 04:05.409
if Aurora had taken my life.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.090
The prophecy says you
three will be felled

04:07.120 --> 04:08.951
by friend, family and foe.

04:08.981 --> 04:10.398
Rebekah was fallen by family.

04:10.428 --> 04:12.054
That leaves friend and foe.

04:12.084 --> 04:13.810
You and Klaus have a lot of foes.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.957
Just one or two.

04:14.987 --> 04:18.154
Thankfully, not many friends.

04:18.156 --> 04:22.125
Freya, this is Stefan Salvatore,
an old friend.

04:22.783 --> 04:25.268
One of my trickle-down sirelings.
Long story.

04:25.298 --> 04:28.104
Stefan, this is Freya,
my brand-new older sister.

04:28.134 --> 04:29.900
Also a long story.

04:29.930 --> 04:31.445
Stefan needs a favor.

04:31.475 --> 04:34.088
You're an old "friend," are you?

04:34.330 --> 04:37.258
Well, that kind of depends
on your definition.

04:41.361 --> 04:42.813
(Exhales)

04:47.233 --> 04:48.219
You got everything you need

04:48.249 --> 04:49.804
to break the sire link?

04:50.106 --> 04:52.798
Almost. Aya's getting the rest.

04:52.828 --> 04:54.275
I should be ready by sunrise.

04:56.111 --> 04:58.412
It'll be fine. I promise.

04:59.818 --> 05:01.787
You may feel some warmth
when the spell begins,

05:01.817 --> 05:04.101
but it'll pass when the link's broken.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.188
I know that face.

05:08.436 --> 05:09.323
Crazy spell.

05:09.353 --> 05:11.547
Substitute hearts, creepy
witches helping you out.

05:11.577 --> 05:14.328
What if the warmth is the
last thing that I feel?

05:14.702 --> 05:15.701
I'll be careful.

05:15.731 --> 05:17.982
I get that. And I am game.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.351
But we are on a tight rope
with the Mikaelsons.

05:20.353 --> 05:21.735
I mean, that's not just anybody's heart.

05:21.737 --> 05:23.854
Jackson was a friend
to them and he was to us.

05:24.349 --> 05:26.486
I know, Marcel.

05:26.810 --> 05:29.670
And I know it's a long shot,
but if I don't save you,

05:29.700 --> 05:32.029
then I can't save Josh
and I can't save Kol.

05:32.259 --> 05:33.781
I wouldn't be able to live with myself

05:33.783 --> 05:36.314
if something happened to you guys.

05:43.768 --> 05:44.652
So, um,

05:44.682 --> 05:48.679
just full disclosure.
I dated your sister once.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.681
Oh.

05:50.121 --> 05:53.300
While that seems like a great story,

05:53.809 --> 05:56.554
let's get back to your wound.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.594
A mystical vampire huntress

05:58.624 --> 06:00.791
stabbed you with her magic sword,

06:00.793 --> 06:03.677
Klaus killed her, but...
surprise, surprise...

06:03.679 --> 06:05.486
- She regenerates.
- (Sighs)

06:05.516 --> 06:07.871
- And won't rest until you're dead.
- Right.

06:07.901 --> 06:11.798
So no matter how far I run,
this wound acts as a beacon,

06:11.828 --> 06:13.356
drawing her to me.

06:13.850 --> 06:16.807
So, I guess you could say it's
been a bit of a rough week.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.714
(Chuckles) Well, I can't cure the wound,

06:18.744 --> 06:20.665
but this paste will mask its signal.

06:20.695 --> 06:22.501
Rayna Cruz won't know how to find you.

06:22.531 --> 06:23.613
Just let that dry,

06:23.615 --> 06:26.508
and you'll be on your merry way.

06:26.991 --> 06:28.702
You know, not that I was expecting a,

06:28.732 --> 06:30.454
uh, parade or anything,

06:30.456 --> 06:34.207
but why is everyone
so eager for me to go?

06:34.313 --> 06:36.360
Stefan Salvatore is not the problem.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.812
But if you are so determined
to find foe amongst friends,

06:38.814 --> 06:40.486
then look no further than Marcel.

06:40.516 --> 06:43.105
After all, did he not steal
Jackson's heart and deliver it

06:43.135 --> 06:45.185
to the very people bent on harming us?

06:45.187 --> 06:47.059
Marcel is the least of our troubles.

06:47.089 --> 06:49.884
What's troubling the
Mikaelsons? Oh, let's see.

06:49.914 --> 06:52.559
Well, there's Elijah's
super secret society

06:52.561 --> 06:54.428
of ancient vampires...

06:54.430 --> 06:56.230
The Strix would still be
clamoring over Hayley's heart

06:56.232 --> 06:58.432
- if it weren't for Marcel.
- Freya: One of their more

06:58.434 --> 07:01.318
zealous members, an
old flame of Elijah's,

07:01.320 --> 07:03.520
is trying to undo my mother's
most powerful spell.

07:03.522 --> 07:04.772
Klaus: And now Aya

07:04.774 --> 07:05.906
and her mob are free

07:05.908 --> 07:08.025
to break the sire line.
You know, we have made

07:08.027 --> 07:09.993
many glorious enemies
over the years, brother,

07:09.995 --> 07:12.544
but if they sever their link to us,

07:12.574 --> 07:14.248
then they will all come for our heads.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.449
Not without the white oak.

07:15.451 --> 07:17.167
Aurora has the last of it.

07:17.169 --> 07:18.702
Then she dies first.

07:18.704 --> 07:22.539
You once told me you wanted
to use her head as a footstool.

07:24.093 --> 07:26.009
Why wait?

07:26.011 --> 07:28.722
(Phone vibrating)

07:29.265 --> 07:31.014
- Hayley.
- (Phone beeps)

07:31.915 --> 07:33.634
Yes.

07:33.976 --> 07:35.753
I see.

07:36.939 --> 07:40.808
The Crescent wolves...
They found Aurora.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.503
(Laughs) Hardly, darling.

12:27.505 --> 12:29.588
Though between a sub-par piece
of art and a broken relic,

12:29.590 --> 12:32.758
I suppose you'd have to choose
the swords, wouldn't you?

12:32.760 --> 12:34.543
If only out of denial.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.878
(Gasps)

12:36.298 --> 12:38.299
Maybe we can't hurt each other in here,

12:38.329 --> 12:43.051
but when I'm free, I'm
going to cut you in half.

12:44.172 --> 12:45.713
How's Cami?

12:49.230 --> 12:50.614
(Chuckles)

12:50.644 --> 12:53.562
Who says we can't hurt
each other in here?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.483
Let me guess.

12:59.563 --> 13:00.836
I'm the chessboard.

13:00.866 --> 13:02.393
Not exactly, but this room

13:02.423 --> 13:04.562
was designed by someone who knew you,

13:04.592 --> 13:06.031
intimately.

13:06.777 --> 13:08.243
So you should ask yourself,

13:08.245 --> 13:09.928
how does Aya see you?

13:09.930 --> 13:11.564
You realize that I'm here because

13:11.594 --> 13:13.266
my people love me. You're here because

13:13.268 --> 13:15.740
those exact same people loathe you.

13:15.770 --> 13:18.072
You've driven them to this.

13:18.102 --> 13:19.510
It's a prison of your own making.

13:19.959 --> 13:21.896
Shackled to your miserable existence

13:21.926 --> 13:24.131
from the moment I sired you.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.544
Precisely.

13:25.546 --> 13:27.079
We are your children.

13:27.109 --> 13:29.198
We came to you. We begged you

13:29.200 --> 13:32.206
to lock yourselves away until
the prophecy window had passed,

13:32.236 --> 13:35.471
to, for once, bear the burden
of being our creators.

13:35.473 --> 13:37.323
Would you mind terribly if you spared me

13:37.325 --> 13:39.191
the deadbeat dad lecture?

13:39.771 --> 13:40.743
You know,

13:40.745 --> 13:44.769
I'm almost grateful for those
hundred-odd years

13:44.799 --> 13:47.866
I spent compelled being you.

13:48.018 --> 13:49.685
It taught me so much.

13:49.687 --> 13:53.072
But nothing more important
than how to not be you.

13:53.102 --> 13:56.280
Where you betray, I prove loyal.

13:56.310 --> 13:59.075
Where you abandon, I remain.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.603
And should you find a knight
or two in shining armor

14:01.633 --> 14:05.403
still foolish enough to fight for you...

14:08.176 --> 14:10.556
They will die right alongside you.

14:15.458 --> 14:19.120
I had no idea that Aya was gonna
take Klaus and Elijah down.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.683
And regardless, why the hell

14:20.685 --> 14:22.907
are we trusting this
guy all of a sudden, huh?

14:22.937 --> 14:25.331
He's the one who ran off with
Aurora the first chance he got.

14:25.361 --> 14:27.690
You can hardly fault a man
for following his heart.

14:27.842 --> 14:29.124
Yet the moment she started raving

14:29.126 --> 14:30.459
about firing white oak into Klaus,

14:30.461 --> 14:31.356
well, words were said,

14:31.386 --> 14:33.317
hearts broken, veins drained.

14:33.347 --> 14:34.885
You're one to talk about trust.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.383
Who was it that handed
my dead husband's heart

14:37.385 --> 14:38.702
to the people that helped murder him?

14:38.732 --> 14:40.586
I bought your life with that heart.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.327
But, hey, you know
what, you called me here,

14:42.357 --> 14:44.529
so if you have another
plan, please, let's hear it.

14:44.559 --> 14:46.659
It's simple. We storm the coven houses,

14:46.689 --> 14:50.411
stop the Strix from completing
the de-siring spell. Period.

14:50.441 --> 14:52.252
Okay. Well, that's easy for you to say.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.194
You're not sired by anyone,
now, are you?

14:54.224 --> 14:55.756
It's not just about de-siring...

14:55.786 --> 14:57.920
We've got to stop an execution.

15:00.113 --> 15:01.456
What are you talking about?

15:01.458 --> 15:04.126
A lovesick teenage witch
with a runner-up heart

15:04.128 --> 15:06.286
is somehow going to break the sire link?

15:06.316 --> 15:08.403
I'm sorry, your darling Davina
is in over her head,

15:08.433 --> 15:10.004
and Aya knows this.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.117
She will let Davina
de-sire both brothers,

15:12.119 --> 15:13.233
then test the spell's success

15:13.263 --> 15:16.422
by firing a white oak
bullet into Klaus's heart.

15:16.824 --> 15:17.816
I mean, it's win-win for her.

15:17.846 --> 15:19.842
If you live, Marcel, well, she's won.

15:19.872 --> 15:23.179
If not, at least she's eliminated
the rival sire line.

15:23.481 --> 15:24.847
Including me.

15:25.027 --> 15:26.931
His prophecy witch said she saw

15:26.961 --> 15:30.235
Klaus die and his entire sire line burn.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.221
She watched us fall,

15:32.251 --> 15:36.665
she watched us burn, every
soul Klaus ever turned.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.727
When Aya tests this spell,

15:38.729 --> 15:41.421
Klaus will fall either way.

15:41.579 --> 15:44.817
And if Davina fails, as she likely will,

15:45.025 --> 15:46.952
the two of us will die as well.

15:47.350 --> 15:48.904
Stefan: Actually...

15:50.850 --> 15:52.575
make that the three of us.

16:00.801 --> 16:02.501
Aurora: You know what, Nik?

16:04.328 --> 16:07.331
Maybe this is the piece
that represents you in here.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.477
(Imitates hooves clopping)

16:11.981 --> 16:15.014
You do quite fancy yourself
the white knight, don't you?

16:15.239 --> 16:17.622
You even carved one out of
white oak when you were a boy.

16:17.652 --> 16:22.049
The one you turned into bullets
to bury in my brother's heart.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.256
Like I said,

16:24.258 --> 16:26.391
there's more than one way to hurt you.

16:26.493 --> 16:27.569
I do like seeing how hard

16:27.599 --> 16:30.122
you work to save the few
who still care about you.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.981
There's Elijah, Cami...

16:34.234 --> 16:36.785
Hmm. It's a pretty short list.

16:39.187 --> 16:42.381
Mention her name again
and you'll regret it.

16:42.643 --> 16:43.664
Ooh.

16:43.694 --> 16:46.445
The white knight indeed.

16:46.632 --> 16:50.449
But do you not also claim
to be a king, darling?

16:50.651 --> 16:52.595
Oh, yes.

16:53.832 --> 16:55.354
That's more fitting.

16:55.521 --> 16:56.822
And yet the king is both

16:56.824 --> 16:59.274
the greatest and the weakest
piece on the board.

16:59.276 --> 17:02.483
It flounders around once
all its defenders desert it.

17:02.513 --> 17:05.386
Much like what will happen to
you when that sire link breaks.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.104
Once their chains fall,

17:07.134 --> 17:09.050
they'll clamor for a piece of white oak

17:09.053 --> 17:11.219
to shove into your heart.

17:13.656 --> 17:14.656
Oh.

17:16.233 --> 17:18.115
Wait, you don't actually
think they fight for you

17:18.145 --> 17:20.145
because they love you, do you?

17:21.912 --> 17:23.766
They have to, Nik.

17:26.301 --> 17:28.270
You're their eternal burden.

17:34.786 --> 17:36.164
Stefan: Could use one
of these access tunnels

17:36.194 --> 17:37.579
to slip into a back room.

17:37.581 --> 17:38.536
Hmm.

17:38.566 --> 17:40.371
What? Worried about
getting a little dirt

17:40.401 --> 17:41.435
on your thousand-dollar shoes?

17:41.465 --> 17:43.674
Actually, I'll be doing most
of the heavy lifting since

17:43.704 --> 17:46.899
the vampires we're facing are,
what, seven times your age?

17:46.929 --> 17:49.395
Is this really the best help we can get?

17:51.961 --> 17:52.933
Doesn't matter.

17:52.963 --> 17:54.796
We're not getting their bodies back.

17:54.798 --> 17:56.081
Strix from all over the world

17:56.111 --> 17:58.205
are flying in to make sure
that this spell goes off.

17:58.235 --> 18:00.024
They're guarding every
entrance and exit.

18:00.054 --> 18:01.325
Well, you're their leader.

18:01.355 --> 18:03.188
Call a meeting, schedule a retreat.

18:03.190 --> 18:05.142
- Order them to stop.
- Nah, nah, nah, nah.

18:05.172 --> 18:06.158
I do that,

18:06.160 --> 18:08.315
Aya has no problem staging a coup.

18:08.345 --> 18:09.928
Marvelous. I guess it's on me

18:09.930 --> 18:11.647
to come up with our grand plan, then.

18:11.649 --> 18:14.099
Hayley: No need, Lucien.

18:14.101 --> 18:16.902
Freya figured out a way to get
the boys out of the chambre.

18:16.904 --> 18:19.438
She just needs a strong
enough power source.

18:19.440 --> 18:20.507
I'd channel Finn,

18:20.537 --> 18:22.747
but he's all for letting
our brothers perish.

18:22.777 --> 18:25.232
So I'll channel Lucien.

18:25.262 --> 18:27.554
The older the vampire,
the better the battery.

18:27.584 --> 18:28.737
Hayley: We're gonna buy her some time,

18:28.767 --> 18:31.033
- keep the Strix occupied.
- Wait, so you want me

18:31.035 --> 18:33.174
here holding hands with the
leftover sister while you

18:33.204 --> 18:35.364
take the two toddlers
and tackle the Strix?

18:35.394 --> 18:36.622
You must be jok...

18:40.192 --> 18:41.794
That was impressive.

18:41.796 --> 18:43.834
Well, I work better with quiet.

18:43.864 --> 18:46.576
Marcel: Wait, so the plan is
that the three of us are gonna

18:46.606 --> 18:51.703
keep 100 of the world's most
ancient vampires occupied?

18:52.635 --> 18:55.507
Well, there could be another way.

18:55.983 --> 18:59.165
All you have to do is
get us to the front door.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.167
Stefan: Are we close?

19:15.724 --> 19:17.938
A few more minutes.

19:21.106 --> 19:22.793
That's a cute kid.

19:22.795 --> 19:26.271
Yeah. She is.

19:27.079 --> 19:28.682
She the reason you're here?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.634
In a trunk with a stranger,

19:30.636 --> 19:33.137
going into a fight we may not win?

19:33.405 --> 19:35.989
She's not the only reason, but yeah.

19:37.559 --> 19:41.394
Maybe I just don't want her
to grow up without a father.

19:41.396 --> 19:42.901
Hmm.

19:43.271 --> 19:45.682
Guess that depends on the father.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.268
I could have done without mine.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.769
If it weren't for my brother,

19:49.771 --> 19:51.321
I probably wouldn't
have survived the guy.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.323
So he stood up for you

19:53.325 --> 19:56.743
and now you're risking
your life for him?

19:56.745 --> 19:59.446
Yeah. Something like that.

20:02.639 --> 20:05.001
You know, I never
understood the brotherly bond

20:05.003 --> 20:07.120
until I met Klaus and Elijah.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.673
They hurt each other
more than anyone, but...

20:10.675 --> 20:14.427
they're vicious when it comes
to protecting each other.

20:15.709 --> 20:17.714
And the ones they care about?

20:20.018 --> 20:22.218
So who's on your homepage, huh?

20:26.764 --> 20:29.476
Ah, Caroline.

20:31.133 --> 20:34.197
- Klaus had a thing for her.
- Yup.

20:34.499 --> 20:37.283
And I'm pretty sure that
I snapped her neck once.

20:37.285 --> 20:40.837
Yeah, well... she's toughened up since.

20:40.839 --> 20:42.622
I don't think you'd win round two.

20:42.624 --> 20:45.564
And she's also in Klaus's sire line.

20:45.594 --> 20:49.228
Is she the reason why you're here?

20:49.769 --> 20:51.431
In a trunk with a stranger,

20:51.433 --> 20:53.733
going into a fight we may not win?

20:54.089 --> 20:56.653
I guess we both have our reasons.

21:06.114 --> 21:08.114
Shh.

21:14.623 --> 21:16.706
Uh-huh.

21:26.468 --> 21:29.385
(Playing minor-key melody)

21:39.003 --> 21:41.236
Why, holy heavens.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.099
Look at you two.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.268
How could a woman really
love either of you?

21:45.270 --> 21:47.009
Even if she can stomach
all your treachery,

21:47.039 --> 21:48.529
she's left to face your brother.

21:48.559 --> 21:51.046
And here we go again with the same tune

21:51.076 --> 21:53.409
you've been singing ever
since you came to town:

21:53.411 --> 21:55.695
"How Elijah ruined our love."

21:55.948 --> 21:58.920
I speak of both of you.
Did you not rip Aya

21:58.950 --> 22:02.271
from Elijah when you forced
him to abandon his loyal Strix?

22:02.301 --> 22:04.370
Just as he tore you from me?

22:04.372 --> 22:06.594
All in the name of
"always and forever"...

22:06.624 --> 22:08.575
A ridiculous concept that ensures

22:08.577 --> 22:12.245
both of you spend
your immortality alone.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.086
Oh.

22:21.085 --> 22:23.827
It appears I've struck a nerve.

22:23.857 --> 22:25.091
Elijah: Tell me something, Aurora.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.927
Have you met your brother Tristan?

22:29.301 --> 22:30.429
Between deception

22:30.459 --> 22:33.564
and rampant abuse, he
frequently, repeatedly,

22:33.594 --> 22:36.603
isolates and abandons you. Of course,

22:36.605 --> 22:38.187
he's painfully aware of something

22:38.189 --> 22:39.368
that we've known all along:

22:39.398 --> 22:44.110
You... are a deranged
and ridiculous child

22:44.112 --> 22:46.112
who cannot be left unsupervised.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.114
Do you know, I think the greatest mercy

22:48.116 --> 22:52.118
that I ever paid my brother
was to compel you to leave him.

22:56.174 --> 22:57.457
Et voilÃ !

22:58.202 --> 22:59.959
Ten centuries later,

22:59.961 --> 23:03.630
he came to that
conclusion all by himself.

23:05.363 --> 23:06.466
Well, look at that.

23:07.486 --> 23:09.802
So it appears I've struck a nerve.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.806
♪♪

23:22.701 --> 23:25.234
(Footsteps approaching)

23:25.855 --> 23:27.036
Any problems?

23:27.038 --> 23:29.822
No. We're nearly there.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.375
After today, one man's recklessness

23:32.377 --> 23:36.212
will no longer weigh on
the shoulders of his sires.

23:36.214 --> 23:38.347
Thousands of vampires across the world

23:38.349 --> 23:41.467
will be freed from the
tyranny of the Originals.

23:46.941 --> 23:49.108
I'm really glad you're here, Marcel.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.783
Stay close by when it happens.

23:52.290 --> 23:53.646
Mm.

23:53.648 --> 23:55.698
I'm not going anywhere.

24:00.989 --> 24:03.155
(Footsteps approaching)

24:13.603 --> 24:14.834
Did you know?

24:15.691 --> 24:16.638
Know what?

24:16.668 --> 24:18.276
She's going to kill them.

24:18.306 --> 24:19.772
Klaus first,

24:19.774 --> 24:22.475
then if the sire line is proven broken,

24:22.477 --> 24:24.527
Elijah won't last much longer.

24:25.622 --> 24:27.980
I didn't know.

24:27.982 --> 24:29.854
But does that really change anything?

24:29.884 --> 24:31.467
If it fails,

24:31.469 --> 24:34.170
and Aya puts Aurora's
bullet into Klaus's heart,

24:34.172 --> 24:35.555
I die.

24:37.712 --> 24:39.225
Josh dies.

24:42.614 --> 24:44.430
You don't think I can do it.

24:44.614 --> 24:46.198
It's too risky.

24:46.228 --> 24:47.900
And either way, Klaus is gone.

24:47.902 --> 24:50.153
Your boyfriend, Kol's brother.

24:50.346 --> 24:52.188
- My sire.
- I get it.

24:52.697 --> 24:55.024
Klaus saved you like you saved me.

24:55.898 --> 24:58.244
You think you owe him, but you don't.

24:59.501 --> 25:01.301
He's taken far more than he's given...

25:01.331 --> 25:03.833
from you, from me, from Kol.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.201
He's had his turn.

25:05.662 --> 25:07.420
Two years ago, you
asked me to find a way

25:07.422 --> 25:10.373
to break the sire link because
you wanted to kill Klaus.

25:11.649 --> 25:12.865
I swore to you

25:12.895 --> 25:14.177
that I would find a way to do it.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.045
Now I have.

25:16.047 --> 25:17.430
You trusted me then.

25:17.687 --> 25:20.049
Circumstances have changed, all right?

25:20.051 --> 25:21.205
- Things are different now,  D.
- No.

25:21.235 --> 25:23.803
We've always protected each other.

25:25.390 --> 25:27.890
When you had me shunned, I was furious.

25:28.511 --> 25:29.726
But now...

25:29.967 --> 25:32.228
I get it.

25:32.230 --> 25:35.231
You'll always protect
me, no matter what.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.567
Even if I hate you for it.

25:41.573 --> 25:44.512
You deserve to be free of Klaus.

25:45.203 --> 25:46.743
We all do.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.413
But I can't do this
if you don't trust me.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.915
I'm scared, Marcel.

25:54.919 --> 25:56.988
You're the only family that I have.

25:57.018 --> 25:58.163
(Sniffles)

26:00.592 --> 26:02.558
So are we in this together?

26:02.560 --> 26:04.093
Because if so, I can do it.

26:04.095 --> 26:05.762
(Sniffles)

26:05.764 --> 26:08.765
No doubts, no hesitation... I can do it.

26:13.772 --> 26:16.022
♪♪

26:19.861 --> 26:21.661
(Sighs)

26:38.694 --> 26:40.598
(Sighs): It's time.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.519
Hey, listen, I... know we
don't really know each other,

26:44.521 --> 26:46.971
but my life is... sort of in your hands,

26:47.001 --> 26:50.942
so let's make this count.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.751
(Groans, sighs)

26:59.753 --> 27:02.454
(Crickets chirping)

27:08.779 --> 27:10.545
I'm ready.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.174
Are you sure?

27:13.204 --> 27:14.420
Take your time.

27:14.858 --> 27:15.723
Aya: If the girl is ready,

27:15.753 --> 27:16.952
she's ready.

27:25.429 --> 27:28.380
All of us have waited
long enough for this.

27:36.056 --> 27:39.441
The unsired heart will bind the
sisters' magic to these waters.

27:41.581 --> 27:44.029
Once the pool's fully charged
with the Mikaelson blood,

27:44.407 --> 27:46.398
I can break the sire link.

27:53.124 --> 27:55.068
- (Chanting softly)
- (Sighs)

27:55.098 --> 27:56.625
Did you have to tie me up?

27:57.359 --> 27:58.794
This will hurt.

27:59.885 --> 28:01.802
I need you not to move.

28:02.176 --> 28:05.083
You're a dark one, Freya Mikaelson.

28:06.170 --> 28:08.253
Vervain ropes. Penetrating spells.

28:08.255 --> 28:10.005
Throw in a Pinot and a cheap motel,

28:10.007 --> 28:11.630
and you've got the
beginnings of a romance.

28:11.660 --> 28:14.176
Well, you'd have to survive this first.

28:14.178 --> 28:15.144
(Ropes creaking)

28:15.146 --> 28:16.845
You see, there's an anchor

28:16.847 --> 28:18.597
locking my brothers inside.

28:18.599 --> 28:20.766
Something representational.

28:20.768 --> 28:22.651
That's why they can't get out.

28:22.653 --> 28:25.437
(Sighs) But I'm going to bust
into this little mental prison

28:25.439 --> 28:27.406
and shatter it from the inside.

28:27.408 --> 28:29.135
And it's going to take most of my power

28:29.165 --> 28:31.082
and probably all of yours.

28:31.825 --> 28:34.475
Oh, luv, my stamina's
never been an issue.

28:35.230 --> 28:37.024
Go on, have at it.

28:37.054 --> 28:40.286
I'll be bound to the edge
of my seat until your return.

We may have an issue.

29:57.659 --> 30:00.360
(Chanting continues)

30:04.115 --> 30:05.532
I need you to focus.

30:05.534 --> 30:06.783
Show me what represents you,

30:06.785 --> 30:08.251
so I can break you out.

30:08.253 --> 30:10.370
- The kings.
- (Grunts)

30:10.372 --> 30:12.455
The knights.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.209
If you've lost contact,

30:16.211 --> 30:18.962
send men to the front
gate to check the...

30:26.013 --> 30:28.221
(Shouting, screaming)

30:33.551 --> 30:35.691
Well, if it isn't Rayna Cruz!

30:36.898 --> 30:39.566
(Grunting, clamoring)

30:43.166 --> 30:44.037
Which is it?

30:44.039 --> 30:45.538
The kings or the knights?

30:45.540 --> 30:47.240
We need to decide now.

(Women chanting)

30:57.052 --> 30:59.102
- Marcel!
- I'm sorry, D.

30:59.426 --> 31:01.855
We need to get them
out of that water now.

31:01.857 --> 31:03.292
No!

31:03.322 --> 31:04.538
(Shouts)

31:05.644 --> 31:07.026
How perfect.

31:07.028 --> 31:09.819
Even in this crucial
hour, your ignorance

31:09.849 --> 31:11.270
blinds you.

31:11.498 --> 31:14.595
Even if you never learn from your sins,

31:14.911 --> 31:16.443
at least you will die

31:16.473 --> 31:19.572
because of them and I get to watch.

31:20.792 --> 31:21.792
(Panting)

31:23.122 --> 31:24.711
Take the queens.

what a monster I've been,

36:50.885 --> 36:55.921
and I am sorry that I
didn't do this sooner.

36:58.593 --> 37:00.309
You can't just leave me here!

37:02.263 --> 37:05.848
I had the right idea when
I bricked up your portrait.

37:05.850 --> 37:08.150
Behind walls is where you belong.

37:08.534 --> 37:09.935
Then just kill me.

37:09.937 --> 37:11.682
Please, Nik, just kill me!

37:11.712 --> 37:13.689
Oh, I think not.

So, while the fish eat him...

37:21.749 --> 37:22.915
No.

37:22.917 --> 37:24.917
And the worms eat you,

37:24.919 --> 37:30.256
just know it was I who
took everything from you.

Your bag's over there.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.572
I figured, after what you
did, I'd better get you out

37:46.574 --> 37:48.346
before the Mikaelsons
came back to hurt you.

37:49.001 --> 37:50.293
You mean like you hurt me?

37:50.295 --> 37:53.212
I asked you to do one thing for me.

37:53.614 --> 37:55.147
To believe in me.

37:55.149 --> 37:57.283
To choose my side.

37:57.285 --> 38:00.069
I asked you to choose me.

38:00.741 --> 38:02.215
But you didn't.

38:02.882 --> 38:03.759
Wait, D.

38:03.789 --> 38:05.408
Listen. Hey.

38:06.341 --> 38:07.593
Listen.

38:07.595 --> 38:08.978
I am always on your side.

38:08.980 --> 38:11.314
All right? I always have your back.

38:11.316 --> 38:13.816
But sometimes the things that you want,

38:13.818 --> 38:16.185
they aren't worth the price
you have to pay to get them.

38:16.729 --> 38:17.937
Yeah?

38:18.451 --> 38:19.772
Keep telling yourself that.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.526
Enjoy your freedom.

38:31.675 --> 38:34.120
So... the spell worked.

38:34.503 --> 38:35.621
We survived.

38:35.623 --> 38:38.674
I saved you and you saved me.

38:39.540 --> 38:41.177
Funny how that works, isn't it?

38:41.179 --> 38:42.795
Mm.

38:42.797 --> 38:45.381
I'd be happy to let this be the end.

38:45.683 --> 38:46.982
Am I too optimistic in thinking

38:46.984 --> 38:48.317
we'll never see each other again?

38:48.319 --> 38:49.602
Well, that depends.

38:49.604 --> 38:51.353
Are you going to do the right thing?

38:51.355 --> 38:54.490
By whom? I assume you
don't mean my brother.

38:55.059 --> 38:57.276
By her.

39:01.833 --> 39:02.825
(Sighs)

39:02.855 --> 39:04.917
I love her.

39:04.919 --> 39:08.420
I know that you did once, too.

39:08.422 --> 39:11.290
I promise I will only do right by her.

39:15.146 --> 39:16.646
Thank you.

39:24.605 --> 39:25.988
You know, um...

39:27.408 --> 39:29.775
there is someone else
you should be thanking.

39:29.777 --> 39:31.160
Marcel had to fight for me,

39:31.162 --> 39:32.445
for his own survival.

39:32.447 --> 39:33.746
I'm talking about Hayley.

39:34.876 --> 39:36.916
For some reason, she cares about you.

39:38.024 --> 39:40.252
Enough to risk her own life.

39:40.616 --> 39:42.171
Take your own advice.

39:42.462 --> 39:43.839
Do right by her.

39:48.463 --> 39:50.012
(Exhales shakily)

39:51.308 --> 39:52.682
You okay?

39:53.999 --> 39:55.384
Never better.

39:58.384 --> 40:00.121
And you...

40:00.151 --> 40:04.643
take care of yourself, old friend.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.120
(Exhales)

40:14.122 --> 40:15.454
What's wrong with me?

40:15.969 --> 40:17.990
You hemorrhaged an enormous amount

40:17.992 --> 40:20.993
of mystical energy, enough
to create a nexus vorti.

40:21.663 --> 40:22.578
It's nothing

40:22.580 --> 40:24.519
a good night's rest won't cure.

40:25.414 --> 40:27.166
