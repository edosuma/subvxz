07:47.601 --> 07:49.837
HE'S A STREET PERFORMER.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.105
- HOW ROMANTIC.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.242
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.711
LAST NIGHT,
WE MADE LOVE ON THE ROOF.

07:57.745 --> 08:00.681
UNDERNEATH THE STARS.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.883
NEVER DID ANYTHING LIKE THAT
WITH BRIAN.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.253
- I DON'T KNOW. I RECALL HEARING

08:06.286 --> 08:08.121

- DAPHNE.
- YOUR WORDS, DARLING, NOT MINE.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.729

LA CAMPANELLA

08:15.763 --> 08:18.599
ONE MORE TIME,
I'M GOING TO SCREAM.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.669

08:42.322 --> 08:45.559
- WELL,
WHO'S BEEN PAYING FOR IT?

08:50.297 --> 08:52.933
- I HEARD YOUR PROFILE.
YOU SOUND HOT.

08:52.966 --> 08:56.737
- UH-HUH.
- SO WHAT ARE YOU INTO?

08:56.770 --> 09:00.007
- SITTING ON YOUR FACE
WHILE YOU SUCK MY BALLS.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.010
- OH, YEAH.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.679
OH, FUCK, I'M SO HARD.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.848
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A HIT
OF POPPERS,

09:07.881 --> 09:10.350
STICK A COUPLE OF FINGERS UP
YOUR HOLE, AND JERK OFF?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.319
- OH, GOD. I'M COMING.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.955
- YOU'RE WASTING IT
ON THE PHONE.

09:14.988 --> 09:20.694
WHAT KIND OF PATHETIC TROLL
ARE YOU?

09:20.728 --> 09:22.930
- * YOU CAN'T GET
NO HONEY *

09:22.963 --> 09:24.798
* IT'S A WASTE

09:24.832 --> 09:28.035
- YOU DIDN'T MEAN WHAT YOU SAID
IN THE PARK, DID YOU?

09:28.068 --> 09:31.238
- NO COOKIES BEFORE LUNCH?
- HMM.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.974
NO BABIES AFTER GUS.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.909
- WELL, NOW THAT HE'S
IN PRE-SCHOOL,

09:35.943 --> 09:38.912
I WAS HOPING TO RETURN
TO CIVILIAN LIFE.

09:38.946 --> 09:42.650
YOU KNOW, TEACH, GET BACK
INTO MY ART.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.852
SARA EVEN SAID THAT,
IF I HAD ENOUGH PAINTINGS,

09:44.885 --> 09:47.054
SHE COULD GIVE ME A SHOW.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.990
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
IF WE HAVE ANOTHER KID?

09:50.023 --> 09:53.093
- I UNDERSTAND, BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE WE CAN POP OUT A BABY

09:53.126 --> 09:54.995
WHENEVER WE WANT.
- OHH.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.766
- IT REQUIRES TIMING,
PLANNING...

09:58.799 --> 10:05.005
- WRONG TIME, WRONG PLAN.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.007
- YOU LOVED BEING PREGNANT.

10:07.040 --> 10:12.212
- I DID?
- UH, GOD, WERE YOU EVER SEXY!

10:12.245 --> 10:18.051
- I WAS?
- YOU HAD A BIG, HARD BELLY

10:18.085 --> 10:21.121
AND HOT, LUSCIOUS TITS,

10:21.154 --> 10:27.027
AND YOU WERE HORNY
ALL THE TIME.

10:27.060 --> 10:31.164
- OH, I DON'T REMEMBER IT
QUITE THAT FONDLY.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.365
[coughing]

10:32.399 --> 10:33.967
- OKAY.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.804
THEN HOW ABOUT THIS?

10:36.837 --> 10:40.974
WHEN WE BROUGHT GUS HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL,

10:41.008 --> 10:45.846
YOU SAID, "I WANT A HOUSE
FILLED WITH CHILDREN,

10:45.879 --> 10:49.116
"CHILDREN WHO KNOW
THEY'RE LOVED,

10:49.149 --> 10:52.920
WHO ARE AN EXPRESSION
OF OUR LOVE."

10:55.956 --> 10:58.892
- MM-HM.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.366
YOU'RE VERY PERSUASIVE,
COUNCILLOR.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.207

11:17.911 --> 11:19.279
- OH, THANK YOU, BENJAMIN.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.081
BUT I'M ON MY WAY
TO MEET MR. RIGHT.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.349
- I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY MET HIM.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.951
- OH, IT'S JUST--

11:23.984 --> 11:25.719
JUST THIS GAME
THAT TEDDY AND I PLAY.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.420
WE FIND EACH OTHER AT BABYLON,

11:27.454 --> 11:29.957
AND HE'LL SAY SOMETHING TO ME
LIKE, "COME HERE OFTEN?",

11:29.990 --> 11:32.025
AND I'LL SAY SOMETHING
TO HIM LIKE,

11:32.059 --> 11:34.094
"ONLY WHEN MY BOYFRIEND'S
OUT OF TOWN."

11:34.127 --> 11:36.897
AND THEN WE GO BACK TO HIS PLACE
AND FUCK LIKE BUNNIES.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.732
- OH, THAT'S CUTE.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.768
- SO DO YOU GUYS WANT
TO HOOK UP LATER?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.169
- NOTHING SHORT OF A DISASTER

11:42.202 --> 11:44.171
COULD DRAG US OUT OF THE HOUSE.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.405
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.907
WELL, TRY NOT TO BURN
THE PLACE DOWN.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.008
TA!

11:48.041 --> 11:51.912
- BYE.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.181
- COME AND GET IT.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.984
- THESE ARE THE WORDS
I HAVE BEEN DROOLING TO HEAR.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.251

[knock at door]

11:59.953 --> 12:02.322
EMMETT FORGET HIS KEY?

12:02.355 --> 12:04.257

12:04.291 --> 12:05.525
[insistent knock at door]

12:05.558 --> 12:07.394
- YOU DON'T SUPPOSE
THAT COULD BE...

12:07.427 --> 12:09.997
- IF YOU DON'T ANSWER IT,
HE'LL GO AWAY.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.132
- YOU SAID I WAS WELCOME
ANYTIME.

12:12.165 --> 12:17.270
- FUCK.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.405
- AT LEAST GIVE ME
A LITTLE DINNER

12:18.438 --> 12:22.142
AND SCHMOOZE ME UP FIRST.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.276
SO.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.912
WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

12:24.945 --> 12:26.279
- MEE KROB.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.048
- HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
OF MEATLOAF?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.783
- I ONLY MADE ENOUGH FOR TWO.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.985
- OH, WHICH ONE OF YOU IS GOING
TO JOIN ME?

12:32.019 --> 12:34.955
- BRIAN, BEN AND I WOULD LIKE
TO SPEND

12:34.988 --> 12:37.224
AN EVENING AT HOME.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.826
ALONE.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.293
- BUT IT'S "NINE-INCH NITE"
AT BABYLON.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.562
ANY GUY WITH MORE THAN NINE
INCHES GETS IN FOR FREE.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.165
SO I FIGURED
I'D BUY YOUR TICKETS.

12:45.198 --> 12:49.136
- BUT WE PREFER TO SIT
THIS ONE OUT.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.931
- THOUGHT YOU AND MICHAEL
WERE SPENDING

13:17.965 --> 13:21.201

14:00.407 --> 14:02.910
- HEY, STRANGER.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.380
OH, MY GOD, IT'S, UM...
- DIJON.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.249
LIKE THE MUSTARD.
- RIGHT!

14:09.282 --> 14:11.384
YEAH, I KNEW YOU WERE
A CONDIMENT.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.987

ABOUT YOU, BABY.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.457
- YOU HAVE?
THAT'S--THAT'S SWEET.

14:17.490 --> 14:21.061

14:25.966 --> 14:29.069
- AND I HAVE
A THREE-DAY LAYOVER.

14:29.102 --> 14:34.141
PLENTY OF TIME TO GET LAID,
OVER AND OVER.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.308
YOU STILL UP FOR THAT DATE?

14:35.342 --> 14:37.410
- DATE?

14:37.444 --> 14:40.413
- THAT WE MADE AT THE GYM
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

14:40.447 --> 14:46.019
MAYBE THIS WILL JOG
YOUR MEMORY.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.157
- AH, YEAH--

14:50.190 --> 14:56.163
OH, YEAH,

15:02.202 --> 15:05.939
THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT
HAS CHANGED.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.708
- POSTAGE WENT UP?
- HMM.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.112
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.713
- WELL, I WON'T TELL
YOUR BOYFRIEND

15:13.746 --> 15:19.119
IF YOU WON'T TELL MINE.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.454

15:44.044 --> 15:46.346
- OH!
TEDDY, IT'S YOU, HEY.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.647
- WHO DID YOU THINK IT WAS?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.249
YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE SO LONG,

15:49.282 --> 15:51.018
I THOUGHT YOU'D FALLEN IN
OR SOMETHING.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.220
OR MET SOMEONE ELSE.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.722
- MET SOMEONE ELSE!

15:55.755 --> 15:58.225
SO FUNNY.
[laughter]

16:06.399 --> 16:08.368
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.
ARE YOU READY TO GO?

16:08.401 --> 16:09.769
- THE NIGHT IS YOUNG.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.771
- NOT AS YOUNG AS IT ONCE WAS.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.107
- WHY DON'T YOU COME DANCE?
- MICHAEL, I TOLD YOU.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.575
I HAVE CLASS FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.776
- THAT'S PERFECT.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.511
YOU CAN LEAVE STRAIGHT
FROM HERE.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.314
- GOTTA GO.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.750

16:23.783 --> 16:25.052
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

16:25.085 --> 16:30.557
*

16:30.590 --> 16:34.294
- JUSTIN TELLS ME
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.263
- NO, I LIKE TO THINK
I INHERITED IT

16:36.296 --> 16:37.364
FROM MY GRANDFATHER.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.533
- HE WAS
AT A CONCENTRATION CAMP.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.136
- OH!
OH, I'M SORRY...

16:43.170 --> 16:44.304
- LUCKILY, HE SURVIVED,

16:44.337 --> 16:46.039
AND HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO PLAY.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.674
- THANK GOD.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.076
- I'M ALSO FORTUNATE
TO HAVE PARENTS

16:49.109 --> 16:50.477
WHO PAID
FOR ALL THOSE LESSONS

16:50.510 --> 16:52.145
EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH MONEY.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.514
- WELL, HOW NICE TO HEAR SOMEONE

16:54.547 --> 16:57.117
PRAISING THEIR PARENTS
FOR A CHANGE.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.186
- I SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.121
YOU'RE JUST NOT AROUND
TO HEAR IT.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.323
- WELL, I GOTTA GO.
I GOTTA PRACTICE.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.492
- ETHAN'S A FINALIST
FOR THE HEIFETZ COMPETITION.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.726
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.296
I HOPE YOU WIN IT.
- ME TOO.

17:09.329 --> 17:12.165
NICE TO MEET YOU, MRS. TAYLOR.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.700
- MWAH.
MY PLEASURE.

17:13.733 --> 17:17.237
- THANKS AGAIN FOR LUNCH.
AND YOU...

17:17.270 --> 17:20.173
SEE YOU AT HOME.
- YEAH.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.578
- WELL.

17:25.612 --> 17:29.116
HE SEEMS LIKE
AN ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG MAN.

17:29.149 --> 17:32.119
- DON'T LEAVE OUT "CUTE."
- VERY CUTE.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.621
AND CERTAINLY MORE APPROPRIATE
FOR YOU THAN BRIAN.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.190
NOT THAT I HAVE ANYTHING
AGAINST BRIAN.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.425
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR HIM,
I DON'T KNOW

17:38.458 --> 17:40.127
WHAT EITHER ONE OF US
WOULD HAVE--

17:40.160 --> 17:41.328
- DO YOU MIND
IF WE DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.130
I'M WITH ETHAN NOW.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.598
LET ME GET THE TIP.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.767
- PUT YOUR MONEY AWAY.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.871
- IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GOING
TO NEED IT.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.674
- MAYBE I CAN HELP WITH TUITION.
AT LEAST PART OF IT.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.609
- YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF AND MOLLY.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.278
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

17:58.311 --> 18:01.848
- MOLLY SAYS HE ASKS ABOUT YOU.

18:01.881 --> 18:05.252
- LIKE I GIVE A SHIT.
- JUSTIN.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.420
MAYBE NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT
WITH BRIAN, HE MIGHT--

18:07.454 --> 18:10.357
- I'M NOT ASKING DAD
FOR A FUCKING THING.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.695
- HE'S BEEN VERY GENEROUS
WITH YOUR SISTER.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.431
MAYBE IF YOU EXPLAINED
THE SITUATION,

18:18.465 --> 18:19.699
HE MIGHT COME THROUGH.

18:19.732 --> 18:23.636
AFTER ALL,
HE'S STILL YOUR FATHER.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.575
- I KNOW
I MAY NOT BE STANDING HERE

18:28.608 --> 18:29.642
WITH A RAZOR BLADE AT MY WRIST

18:29.676 --> 18:31.244
OR A LIGHT BULB UP MY ASS,

18:31.278 --> 18:34.714
BUT I NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE NOW!

18:34.747 --> 18:36.716
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE
GODDAMNED GAY CRISIS HELP LINE

18:36.749 --> 18:38.818
TO TAKE MY CALL
FOR THE PAST 15 MINUTES.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.454
- YOU SHOULD TELL THEM YOU HAVE
A REALLY BAD TINT JOB.

18:41.488 --> 18:45.392
I'M SURE THEY'D PUT YOU
RIGHT THROUGH.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.927
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

18:47.960 --> 18:51.464
- THE PROBLEM IS

18:51.498 --> 18:53.833
I HAVE THIS FRIEND...
- THAT WOULD BE YOU.

18:53.866 --> 18:57.537
- WHO IS IN LOVE
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND...

18:57.570 --> 18:59.206
- THAT WOULD BE THEODORE.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.540
- BUT BEFORE THEY REALIZED
THEY WERE IN LOVE,

19:00.573 --> 19:02.542
MY FRIEND MADE
THIS PREVIOUS COMMITMENT.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.611
- FUCK DATE.
- WITH THIS REALLY,

19:04.644 --> 19:06.279
REALLY HOT FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.614
- DIJON?
LIKE THE MUSTARD?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.416
- GOD, HE'S A FIRST-CLASS FUCK.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.784
PLUS YOUR FRIEND WILL GET
FREE BONUS MILES.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.521
- SO WHAT ABOUT THE REMORSE
AND GUILT?

19:14.554 --> 19:15.955
- TELL HIM NOT TO SWEAT IT.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.757
HE'S PROTECTED
BY THE GRANDFATHER CLAUSE.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.827
- WHAT'S THAT?
- THAT STATES THAT ANY AGREEMENT

19:20.860 --> 19:22.729
MADE BEFORE THE CURRENT
ARRANGEMENT

19:22.762 --> 19:23.796
IS STILL CONSIDERED
LEGALLY BINDING

19:23.830 --> 19:25.765
AND MUST THEREFORE BE HONORED.

19:25.798 --> 19:29.902
- SO YOU MEAN MY FRIEND
COULD ACTUALLY BLOW

19:29.936 --> 19:31.438
SAID REALLY HOT
FLIGHT ATTENDANT

19:31.471 --> 19:34.307
AND STILL BE WITHIN HIS RIGHTS?

19:34.341 --> 19:37.710
- AS LONG AS HE KEEPS
HIS MOUTH SHUT AFTERWARDS.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.387
- HOW ABOUT A TIDE?

19:47.420 --> 19:48.655
- NO, I'VE ALREADY GOT IT.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.922
- MULTI-GRAIN CHEERIOS?

19:49.956 --> 19:51.658
- FOR YOUR RAGU?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.593
- DEAL.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.362
[chuckling]

19:55.395 --> 19:56.929
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

19:56.963 --> 19:58.665
- REMEMBER WHEN I WAS TEACHING
THAT CLASS

19:58.698 --> 20:00.400
ON ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM

20:00.433 --> 20:03.403
AND YOU WERE LECTURING
ON THE METAPHYSICAL POETS?

20:03.436 --> 20:06.639
NOW WE'RE SWAPPING COUPONS
FOR THE SHOP 'N SAVE.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.375
- TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I DON'T MIND IT.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.942
BESIDES, WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY
ABOUT ROTHKO OR DONNE

20:09.976 --> 20:11.544
THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN SAID?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.513
- IT'S JUST
THAT SOMETIMES I FEEL

20:13.546 --> 20:15.415
LIKE I'M MISSING
ALL THE EXCITEMENT.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.418
MELANIE'S OUT THERE, MAKING
THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE,

20:18.451 --> 20:20.353
AND WHAT AM I DOING?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.422
- RAISING BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN
TO LIVE IN IT.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.391
- CORRECTION: ONE CHILD.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.692
- WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEAR.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.360
- WHAT?
- AH, I SAW YOUR BETTER HALF

20:27.394 --> 20:29.296
AT THE CASH MACHINE
THIS MORNING.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.830
SHE TOLD ME THE BIG NEWS.
- WHAT BIG NEWS?

20:30.863 --> 20:32.499
- OH, AND I'VE ALREADY GOT
YOUR NAMES PICKED OUT.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.966
SHANE IF IT'S A BOY,
SABRINA IF IT'S A GIRL.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.602
YOU CAN TELL
THAT I'M WATCHING AMC.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.637
- MELANIE TOLD YOU WE'RE HAVING
ANOTHER KID?

20:37.670 --> 20:41.974
- YEAH, SHE WAS ALL EXCITED.
SHE SAID YOU COULDN'T WAIT.

20:42.008 --> 20:45.312
- YOU KNOW, I WAS PUKING MY GUTS
OUT LAST NIGHT.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.847
- MUST'VE BEEN THE VAST AMOUNT
OF DRUGS YOU CONSUMED.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.751
- YEAH, OR MAYBE IT WAS THAT
WEIRD ASIAN SHIT BEN CONCOCTED.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.789
SO WHAT TIME'S DINNER?

20:56.823 --> 20:58.325
- IT'S NOT.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.727
WE'RE GOING TO MY MOM'S.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.463
- OH, THAT SHOULD BE FUN.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.931
ALMOST AS MUCH FUN
AS THE UNDERWEAR PARTY.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.533
- WHAT UNDERWEAR PARTY?

21:06.566 --> 21:09.602
- THE ONE I'M ATTENDING
THIS EVENING.

21:09.636 --> 21:10.803
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT--

21:10.837 --> 21:13.673
WORKING ALL DAY,
FUCKING ALL NIGHT.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.942
- WELL, THEY SAY IN THE VAST
EMPTINESS OF SPACE,

21:15.975 --> 21:17.810
THE FASTER YOU MOVE,
THE SLOWER YOU AGE.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.379
- I HAVE TO BELIEVE

21:19.412 --> 21:21.881
THE SAME HOLDS TRUE
FOR PITTSBURGH.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.050
YOU CARE TO JOIN ME?

21:24.083 --> 21:26.586
- YOU'LL HAVE TO STAY
FOREVER YOUNG WITHOUT ME.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.422
- I UNDERSTAND.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.458
YOU'RE IN A COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR--

21:31.491 --> 21:33.360
WHAT IS THAT HIDEOUS EXPRESSION?

21:33.393 --> 21:36.363
"SIGNIFICANT OTHER"?

21:36.396 --> 21:39.499

[door chimes jingle]

21:45.805 --> 21:47.507

21:55.014 --> 21:56.549
FUCK! BRIAN!

21:56.583 --> 21:58.718
- GOTCHA!
[laughing]

21:58.751 --> 22:01.488
- YOU SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME!

22:01.521 --> 22:03.456
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

22:03.490 --> 22:05.992
- I THOUGHT I'D DROP YOU
AT YOUR MAMA'S.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.994
- YOU ARE SO PATHETIC,
YOU KNOW THAT?

22:08.027 --> 22:11.063
- ACTUALLY, YOU ARE.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.533
- SO WHAT TIME'S
THE PARTY START?

22:13.566 --> 22:18.738
- WHEN I GET THERE, OF COURSE.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.139
- HEY...

22:20.172 --> 22:22.775
YOU JUST--
YOU MISSED MY MOM'S TURN.

22:22.809 --> 22:26.546
- AH. OR SHOULD I SAY,
WHEN WE GET THERE?

22:26.579 --> 22:29.716
- I TOLD YOU I CAN'T GO.
TURN BACK.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.618
- IT'S TOO LATE.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.420
- THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.422
JUST LET ME OUT.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.757
- SORRY.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.526
- I'M CALLING BEN.

22:39.559 --> 22:43.863
- [chuckling]

22:43.896 --> 22:45.798
- THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
GIMME.

22:45.832 --> 22:49.436
- SIT BACK AND RELAX.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.474
OH.

22:54.507 --> 22:58.411
HERE'S A LITTLE PARTY OUTFIT
I GOT YOU.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.847
- I CAN'T STAY.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.050
THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE
IS BECAUSE, MY AUNT LULA,

23:04.083 --> 23:06.886
SHE ALWAYS TAUGHT ME THAT,
IF YOU HAVE TO DELIVER BAD NEWS,

23:06.919 --> 23:08.655
IT'S BEST TO DO IT IN PERSON.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.923
"IT'S JUST PLAIN GOOD MANNERS!",
SHE WOULD SAY.

23:10.957 --> 23:14.627
SO, UM, BYE.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.529
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.864
WHAT'S YOUR HURRY, BABY?

23:17.897 --> 23:20.199
COME ON IN.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.602
- I-I'M AFRAID IT'S GOING
TO BE IMPOSSIBLE

23:22.635 --> 23:25.204
FOR US TO KEEP
THIS LITTLE TRYST.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.874
I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP, SEE,

23:27.907 --> 23:31.644
WITH THIS REALLY WONDERFUL MAN.
- MM-HMM.

23:31.678 --> 23:35.748
- AND EVEN THOUGH I COULD CITE
THE GRANDFATHER CLAUSE--

23:35.782 --> 23:40.219
- CAN I GET YOU A BEVERAGE?
- OH, BLOODY MARY.

23:40.252 --> 23:43.556
I HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO.

23:43.590 --> 23:47.226
INSTEAD, I CHOOSE TO HONOR
MY COMMITMENT.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.761
TO THE LETTER.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.798
- PEANUTS OR PRETZELS?
- PEANUTS.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.033
SO I HOPE
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT,

23:54.066 --> 23:56.736
EVEN THOUGH I WOULD
REALLY, REALLY LIKE TO STAY

23:56.769 --> 24:02.141
FOR THE IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT,
I--

24:02.174 --> 24:03.843
WHAT'S THAT?

24:03.876 --> 24:06.779
- THE AIRLINE AWARDED THAT TO ME

24:06.813 --> 24:09.015
FOR SERVICING
OVER 10,000 PASSENGERS.

24:09.048 --> 24:12.785
- AH, "TO DIJON,"

24:12.819 --> 24:14.253
LIKE THE MUSTARD,

24:14.286 --> 24:17.590
"WHO WILL GO TO ANY LENGTH
TO MAKE SURE

24:17.624 --> 24:19.926
SATISFACTION IS GUARANTEED."

24:19.959 --> 24:24.196
[beep]

24:24.230 --> 24:29.001
I SEE WHAT THEY MEAN
BY "ANY LENGTH."

24:29.035 --> 24:31.938
- AND I SEE YOU'RE ALREADY IN
THE UPRIGHT AND LOCKED POSITION.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.573
[jet engines humming]

24:33.606 --> 24:35.675
- WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU,
YOU LITTLE ASSHOLE?

24:35.708 --> 24:37.076
I'VE BEEN CALLING
AND LEAVING MESSAGES

24:37.109 --> 24:38.611
FOR YOU
FOR OVER AN HOUR,

24:38.645 --> 24:40.847
AND NOT ONE FUCKING "BOO"
FROM YOU.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.649
WELL, YOU'D BETTER BE
ON YOUR WAY OVER HERE

24:42.682 --> 24:44.050
IS ALL I GOTTA SAY,
'CAUSE MY GODDAMN DINNER'S

24:44.083 --> 24:45.752
TURNING TO SHIT.

24:45.785 --> 24:49.088
LOVE, MOTHER.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.891
- THIS GARLIC BREAD'S NOT BAD
FOR A DOORSTOP.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.793
- SHUT UP.
- [chuckles]

24:53.826 --> 24:55.061
- SO IT'S A DRIED-OUT MESS.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.664
THAT'S WHY ITALIANS
INVENTED SAUCE.

24:57.697 --> 25:01.868
WELL, WE WILL GO AHEAD
WITH OUR DINNER,

25:01.901 --> 25:04.704
WITH OR WITHOUT MY SON.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.839
- YOU KNOW, IT ISN'T
LIKE MICHAEL NOT TO SHOW UP.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.307
OR EVEN CALL.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.645
- NO, BUT IT'S EXACTLY
LIKE YOU-KNOW-WHO.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.547
- WHO? BRIAN?

25:14.581 --> 25:16.015
- YOU WIN THE VEAL.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.917
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'S WITH BRIAN?

25:17.950 --> 25:19.852
- YOU SAID THEY'VE BEEN OUT
EVERY NIGHT THIS WEEK.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.654
- AND LAST.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.156
- WELL, YEAH, BRIAN NEEDS
HIS BEST FRIEND RIGHT NOW.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.324
THOUGH HE WOULD
NEVER ADMIT THAT.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.759
HE WANTS EVERYONE TO THINK

25:26.793 --> 25:28.094
HE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.
EXCUSE ME.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.696
- COVER YOUR EARS, SIS.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.598
- BUT HE IS HURTING INSIDE.

25:31.631 --> 25:34.967
AND THE MORE HE'S HURTING,
THE MORE HE TRIES TO HIDE IT.

25:35.001 --> 25:38.571
- WHAT AN INCREDIBLY KIND,
COMPASSIONATE THING TO SAY.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.607
YOU REALLY ARE
A HELL OF A NICE GUY.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.674
- THANK YOU, DEBBIE.

25:41.708 --> 25:44.010
- FUCK "NICE."

25:44.043 --> 25:46.078
UNLESS YOU KNOCK SOME SENSE
INTO THAT BOYFRIEND OF YOURS,

25:46.112 --> 25:48.715
BRIAN'S GONNA KEEP HAULING HIM
OFF TO GOD KNOWS WHERE,

25:48.748 --> 25:50.149
AND HE SHOULD BE HERE WITH YOU.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.584
- IT'S NOT UP TO ME.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.152
I CAN'T CONTROL HIM.
- WHY NOT?

25:53.185 --> 25:56.555
SHE'S BEEN DOING IT
FOR 30 YEARS.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.660
- LET'S JUST HOPE MICHAEL
WAKES UP

26:00.693 --> 26:02.895
AND REALIZES HE'S
JUST A SUBSTITUTE FOR JUSTIN.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.164
- ONLY TROUBLE IS,
THE SUBSTITUTE'S

26:05.197 --> 26:08.334
USUALLY THE LAST TO KNOW.

26:08.367 --> 26:11.871
- SAUCE?

26:15.041 --> 26:18.010
- YOUR SON WAS
A CRANKY LITTLE CUSS TONIGHT.

26:18.044 --> 26:22.314
- I LOVE HOW WHEN HE'S CRANKY,
HE'S MY SON.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.050
YOU LOOK A LITTLE CRANKY
YOURSELF.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.618
- DO I?

26:25.652 --> 26:28.287
[water running]

26:28.320 --> 26:30.122
I WENT TO THE SUPERMARKET TODAY.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.258
- MM?
- AND WHILE I WAS THERE,

26:32.291 --> 26:35.695
I RAN INTO DUSTY, WHO TOLD ME
THE MOST ASTONISHING NEWS.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.096
- REALLY? WHAT?

26:37.129 --> 26:40.199
- YOU AND I ARE HAVING
ANOTHER BABY.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.334
GEE, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

26:42.368 --> 26:44.771
- WELL, WE TALKED
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT,

26:44.804 --> 26:46.338
AND I THOUGHT WE DECIDED--

26:46.372 --> 26:47.740
- WE DIDN'T DECIDE ANYTHING.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.308
I SAID I'D THINK ABOUT IT.

26:49.341 --> 26:50.943
AND SINCE I'M THE ONE
WHO'LL BE CARRYING IT,

26:50.977 --> 26:52.111
DON'T YOU THINK I SHOULD HAVE

26:52.144 --> 26:54.113
AT LEAST SOME SAY AS TO WHEN?

26:54.146 --> 26:56.182
- OF COURSE YOU SHOULD, HONEY.
I...

26:56.215 --> 26:57.950
- OH, STOP TRYING
TO PLACATE ME, MEL.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.786
REMINDS ME
OF MY GODDAMN PARENTS.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.220
- I'M NOT TRYING TO PLACATE YOU,

27:01.253 --> 27:03.422
AND WE ARE DEFINITELY
NOT YOUR PARENTS.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.792
- OH, COMPARED TO US, THEY'VE
GOT THE ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE,

27:05.825 --> 27:09.328
AND WE'RE THE HAPPILY MARRIED
STRAIGHT COUPLE OF 1962.

27:09.361 --> 27:13.399
- ALL I SAID IS THAT I WOULD
LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER CHILD.

27:13.432 --> 27:14.834
- AND JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE BREADWINNER,

27:14.867 --> 27:16.035
THAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO TELL ME

27:16.068 --> 27:19.138
WHEN TO POP OUT ANOTHER LOAF?

27:19.171 --> 27:22.775
YOU WANT ANOTHER BABY SO BADLY,
HAVE IT YOURSELF.

27:22.809 --> 27:25.812
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAID THAT.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.815
THAT IS NOT FAIR.
YOU KNOW I CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.817
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL I CAN'T.
THE DOCTORS TOLD ME.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.251
- THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.853
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THERE ARE NEW PROCEDURES.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.287
THEY COULD ZAP YOU WITH A LASER,

27:35.321 --> 27:37.156
AND YOU'D AS BE FERTILE
AS MOTHER EARTH.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.158
BUT, YOU SEE, YOU'D RATHER LET
ME EXPERIENCE THE JOY

27:39.191 --> 27:41.293
OF CHILDBIRTH,
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PLAY DAD,

27:41.327 --> 27:42.795
PASSING OUT THE COHIBAS.
- WHAT?

27:42.829 --> 27:45.798
- [chuckles]
SORRY, MEL. NO CIGAR.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.835
- [sighs]

27:48.868 --> 27:51.103
- YOU WANT A SODA?

27:51.137 --> 27:54.106
- I'LL HAVE THE SAME AS YOU.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.743
- I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
HAVE A DRINK.

27:56.776 --> 27:57.977
- THAT'S BECAUSE I ALWAYS USED
TO WAIT

27:58.010 --> 27:59.779
UNTIL YOU WERE OUT
OF THE HOUSE.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.849
OR ASLEEP.
THANKS.

28:02.882 --> 28:05.885
- MOLLY TELLS ME YOU'RE BETTER.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.120
- YEAH, I'M DOING ALL RIGHT.

28:08.154 --> 28:11.057
- HONEY?

28:11.090 --> 28:13.292
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.431
- HEY, I'M JUST GONNA GO DOWN
TO THE STORE.

28:19.465 --> 28:24.136
- OKAY. SEE YOU SOON.

28:24.170 --> 28:27.239
- OKAY. BYE.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.212
- SHE'S PRETTY.

28:33.245 --> 28:36.816
- YEAH.
HER NAME'S LORI.

28:36.849 --> 28:41.153
WE'VE BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER
FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW.

28:41.187 --> 28:44.891
- I BROUGHT
SOME OF MY LATEST WORK.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.293
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO SEE SOME.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.863
- SURE.

28:50.897 --> 28:53.800
BUT I'M NOT MUCH
OF AN ART CRITIC.

29:02.308 --> 29:07.446
IT'S VERY GOOD.

29:09.015 --> 29:12.184
- THE NEW TERM'S COMING UP,
AND...

29:12.218 --> 29:16.388
I NEED
SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.

29:16.422 --> 29:20.326
I WAS HOPING
MAYBE YOU WOULD HELP ME OUT.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.361
- JUSTIN, I TOLD YOU WHEN YOU
WERE APPLYING TO COLLEGES...

29:22.394 --> 29:24.230
- I KNOW WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.565
BUT NOW THAT I'VE COMPLETED

29:26.598 --> 29:28.334
MY FIRST YEAR WITH HONORS,

29:28.367 --> 29:30.336
IN SPITE OF THE HAND,

29:30.369 --> 29:34.907
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WOULD CHANGE
YOUR MIND.

29:34.941 --> 29:38.010
LOOK, I CAN'T GET A SCHOLARSHIP
BECAUSE YOU MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.913
AND I CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL
AND WORK FULLTIME.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.514
- WHAT ABOUT BRIAN?

29:42.548 --> 29:44.483
- WE'RE NOT TOGETHER ANY MORE.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.819
- FINALLY, SOME GOOD NEWS.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.288
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'VE COME
TO YOUR SENSES.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.290
NOW, IF YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT GOING TO DARTMOUTH OR--

29:51.323 --> 29:55.962
- DAD. I'M NEVER GOING
TO BE A BUSINESSMAN.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.930
AND I'M NEVER GOING
TO BE STRAIGHT.

30:01.868 --> 30:05.371
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

30:05.404 --> 30:07.506
THE ONE THING
THAT MEANT THE MOST TO YOU,

30:07.539 --> 30:10.009
EVEN MORE THAN MAKING
YOUR MOTHER HAPPY,

30:10.042 --> 30:13.112
WAS MAKING ME PROUD.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.248
WHENEVER YOU GOT AN "A"
ON A TEST OR A REPORT CARD,

30:16.282 --> 30:18.885
IT WAS ALWAYS ME
YOU CAME RUNNING TO.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.587
AND NO FATHER EVER COULD HAVE
BEEN PROUDER OF HIS SON

30:21.620 --> 30:23.389
THAN I WAS OF YOU.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.157
- NOW YOU'RE ASHAMED?

30:25.191 --> 30:27.226
- NO.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.361
- THAT I'M NOT THE MAN
YOU WANTED ME TO BE?

30:33.900 --> 30:36.335
WELL...

30:36.368 --> 30:39.071
I AM THE MAN THAT I WANT TO BE.

30:39.105 --> 30:44.610
I'M THE ONLY MAN THAT I CAN BE.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.513
IF YOU CAN'T BE PROUD
OF ME FOR THAT,

30:47.546 --> 30:51.083
THEN THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.630
- GIVE ME THE KEYS.

31:04.663 --> 31:05.932
I'M TAKING THE FUCKING CAR,

31:05.965 --> 31:07.033
AND I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU HERE.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.434
- THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

31:08.467 --> 31:13.372
- GIVE ME MY PHONE!

31:13.405 --> 31:15.307
THANK YOU.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.043
THE BATTERY'S ALMOST DEAD.

31:17.076 --> 31:20.579
- I KNOW.
I WAS FEEDING ON ITS ENERGY.

31:20.612 --> 31:23.449
- BEN?
BEN, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

31:23.482 --> 31:27.253
I'M GOING TO BE A LITTLE LATE.
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

31:27.286 --> 31:31.057
HELLO?

31:31.090 --> 31:33.059
SHIT! I LOST HIM.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.393
- WELL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE

31:34.426 --> 31:36.528
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES

31:36.562 --> 31:39.331
AND JOIN THE PARTY.
- I DON'T WANT TO.

31:39.365 --> 31:41.467
- YOU KNOW, THIS REMINDS ME OF
THE FIRST TIME I BLINDFOLDED YOU

31:41.500 --> 31:43.469
AND TOOK YOU
TO THE LIBERTY BATHS.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.337
YOU WERE SO HOT

31:45.371 --> 31:47.139
WALKING UP AND DOWN THE HALLS

31:47.173 --> 31:49.475
IN YOUR CORDUROYS
AND YOUR FLANNEL.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.111
LOOSEN UP.
- I SAID NO.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.280
- YOU'D RATHER WATCH?

31:54.313 --> 31:57.950
THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

31:57.984 --> 32:01.087
YOU SEE THAT FINE,
UPSTANDING YOUNG MAN

32:01.120 --> 32:03.555
OVER THERE?

32:03.589 --> 32:06.592
FIRST, I'M GOING TO WEAR OUT
HIS JAW ON MY COCK.

32:06.625 --> 32:11.430
THEN I'M GOING
TO REACH AROUND BACK

32:11.463 --> 32:15.001
AND START FINGERING...

32:19.071 --> 32:20.706
WHY NOT SEE FOR YOURSELF?

32:20.739 --> 32:23.709
[upbeat music]

32:23.742 --> 32:31.083
*

32:41.293 --> 32:45.464
- * LET'S GET INTIMATE

32:45.497 --> 32:49.435
* LET'S GET
INTIMATE *

32:49.468 --> 32:54.406
* LET'S GET INTIMATE

32:54.440 --> 32:58.477
* LET'S GET
INTIMATE *

32:58.510 --> 33:02.548
* LET'S GET INTIMATE

33:02.581 --> 33:05.684
* LET'S GET
INTIMATE *

33:05.717 --> 33:07.119
*

33:07.153 --> 33:11.123
* LET'S GET INTIMATE

33:11.157 --> 33:13.492
* LET'S GET
INTIMATE *

33:13.525 --> 33:20.566
*

33:24.803 --> 33:26.438
* LET'S GET INTIMATE

33:26.472 --> 33:28.307
* I LIKE IT

33:28.340 --> 33:30.742
* LET'S GET...

33:39.618 --> 33:42.254
- I NEED TO GET SOME WORK DONE
IN PEACE.

33:42.288 --> 33:45.791
- I DON'T ENVY YOU BREADWINNERS.
HUH.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.493
- DO YOU MIND IF WE NOT TALK
ABOUT BREAD?

33:47.526 --> 33:50.462
I'M TRYING TO WATCH MY CARBS.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.598
- HOW ABOUT SOME EGGS?
- [scoffs]

33:52.631 --> 33:54.266
DON'T EVEN MENTION EGGS.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.734
EGGS ARE THE LAST THING I WANT
TO THINK OF.

33:55.767 --> 33:59.805
- ANY PROBLEM WITH PRUNES?

33:59.838 --> 34:01.407
MEL, HONEY.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.475
AFTER A HEALTHY BREAKFAST,

34:03.509 --> 34:05.477
THE BEST WAY TO START THE DAY

34:05.511 --> 34:07.546
IS BY TELLING ME,

34:07.579 --> 34:13.085
WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON?

34:13.119 --> 34:16.288
- LINDSAY SAYS,
IF I WANT ANOTHER BABY,

34:16.322 --> 34:18.690
I SHOULD CARRY IT MYSELF.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.192
- SOUNDS FAIR TO ME.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.794
EVEN IF I COULD,

34:22.828 --> 34:27.299
I NEVER PICTURED MYSELF
THE "BIRTHING BABIES" TYPE.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.435
ALL THE FUSS AND THE MUSS AND--

34:29.468 --> 34:31.603
- WELL, IT'S DEFINITELY
NOT FOR CONTROL FREAKS

34:31.637 --> 34:33.672
OR THE FAINT OF HEART.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.241
- THAT LET'S ME OUT.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.575
YOU SEE, MY LIFE WORKS BEST

34:36.608 --> 34:38.510
WHEN IT'S GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

34:38.544 --> 34:41.213
MY PLAN.
AND, AS FOR PAIN,

34:41.247 --> 34:44.516
PAIN IS DEFINITELY NOT
ON MY "TO DO" LIST.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.785
- SO YOU'D RATHER LEAVE
THE DIRTY WORK TO HER?

34:46.818 --> 34:48.387
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.256
- WELL, WHAT IS IT THEN?

34:50.289 --> 34:55.661
- IT'S THAT SHE'S BRAVER

34:55.694 --> 34:58.197
AND STRONGER

34:58.230 --> 35:00.866
AND A BETTER WOMAN

35:00.899 --> 35:02.834
THAN I'LL EVER BE.

35:02.868 --> 35:07.273
- THAT'S THE BIGGEST LOAD
OF HORSESHIT I'VE EVER HEARD.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.477
I'M NOT TELLING YOU
IT ISN'T SCARY.

35:11.510 --> 35:14.346
'CAUSE IT'S FUCKING TERRIFYING.

35:14.380 --> 35:17.616
AND I'M NOT TELLING YOU
THAT IT ISN'T PAINFUL.

35:17.649 --> 35:21.220
ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS
I'VE FORGOTTEN THAT.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.789
BUT I AM TELLING YOU
THAT HAVING A KID

35:23.822 --> 35:27.293
IS THE NUMBER ONE,
TOP-RATED EXPERIENCE

35:27.326 --> 35:30.896
IN MY LIFE.

35:30.929 --> 35:33.899
AND I'D HATE TO SEE YOU DEPRIVE
YOURSELF OF ALL OF THAT

35:33.932 --> 35:37.336
BECAUSE YOU THINK
YOU'RE NOT WOMAN ENOUGH.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.705
PFFF.

35:47.546 --> 35:50.549
HOW ABOUT I GET YOU SOME EGGS
AND A NICE, FRESH BUN?

35:50.582 --> 35:53.819
OKAY.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.470
- I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU UP
SO EARLY

36:11.503 --> 36:13.272
AFTER GETTING IN SO LATE.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.674
- IT WAS 1:30-ISH.

36:15.707 --> 36:18.410
- TRY 2:45-ISH.

36:18.444 --> 36:20.946
- HE KIDNAPPED ME.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.714
- HE KIDNAPPED YOU.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.950
- YEAH, AND THEN HE TOOK
MY CELL PHONE,

36:24.983 --> 36:27.253
AND HE SHOVED IT
DOWN HIS PANTS.

36:27.286 --> 36:30.356
- WELL, THAT IS DEFINITELY OUT
OF YOUR CALLING AREA, HUH?

36:30.389 --> 36:32.791
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

36:32.824 --> 36:35.694
- I'M THE ONE WHO TOLD YOU
TO HANG OUT WITH HIM.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.429
ALTHOUGH I DID THINK THAT,

36:37.463 --> 36:38.830
WHEN YOU ASKED ME
TO MOVE IN WITH YOU,

36:38.864 --> 36:40.499
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE HERE
FROM TIME TO TIME.

36:40.532 --> 36:43.835
- I WANTED TO BE.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.238
- [sighs]

36:50.008 --> 36:52.278
I GUESS THIS WASN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.912
- WHAT?
- US LIVING TOGETHER.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.914
- OF COURSE IT IS!

36:55.947 --> 36:57.316
- NO, WE DIDN'T PLAN ON IT,
MICHAEL.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.617
IT JUST HAPPENED
OUT OF CIRCUMSTANCE.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.452
- SO?
- SO MAYBE WE'RE NOT READY.

37:00.486 --> 37:03.322
MAYBE THERE ARE
SOME THINGS IN OUR LIVES

37:03.355 --> 37:04.790
WE NEED TO WORK OUT FIRST.
- WHAT--

37:04.823 --> 37:09.661
- MAYBE I SHOULD FIND
MY OWN APARTMENT.

37:09.695 --> 37:12.264
[door opens]

37:22.774 --> 37:24.676
- DON'T USE UP ALL YOUR ENERGY,
BUNNY.

37:24.710 --> 37:25.977
GOT TO SAVE SOME
FOR OUR WORKOUT.

37:26.011 --> 37:29.548
- [chuckles]

37:29.581 --> 37:31.517
UH...
OH!

37:31.550 --> 37:32.951
OW! OW.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.420
- SWEETIE, WHAT'S WRONG?

37:34.453 --> 37:36.455
- I-I THINK I PULLED A MUSCLE.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.758
- YOU POOR BABY.
- YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.527
I THINK I JUST NEED TO PUT
SOME HEAT ON IT.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.295
I'M GOING TO--I'M GOING
TO GO TO THE STEAM ROOM.

37:43.329 --> 37:45.931
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY, IT'S...

37:45.964 --> 37:48.066
- HEY, SWEET THING!
- HEY!

37:48.099 --> 37:51.637
TEDDY, THIS IS DIJON.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.739
LIKE THE MUSTARD.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.575
THIS IS TED, MY BOYFRIEND.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.845
THE ONE I'M
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.413
- RIGHT.

38:01.447 --> 38:05.016
I'M ON A FLIGHT TONIGHT
TO MIAMI.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.352
- OH, THANK GOD.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.887
I MEAN, THANK GOD FOR YOU.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.889
GETTING OUT OF HERE...
COLD...

38:10.922 --> 38:15.661
- AND WHEN I GET BACK,

38:15.694 --> 38:18.564
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A CALL.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.874
- WHY SHOULD HE GIVE YOU
A CALL?

38:28.907 --> 38:31.543
- HE'S A FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

38:31.577 --> 38:34.546
SO I THINK HE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET US AN UPGRADE.

38:34.580 --> 38:38.817
- WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

38:38.850 --> 38:42.087
WHY WAS HE TOUCHING YOU
LIKE THAT?

38:42.120 --> 38:45.090
- YOU KNOW, HE WAS GIVEN
AN AWARD FOR SERVICE.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.058
HE'S VERY ATTENTIVE.

38:47.092 --> 38:51.830
- YEAH, I NOTICED.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.833
YOU DID IT WITH HIM,
DIDN'T YOU?

39:02.874 --> 39:05.811
WELL, AT LEAST I KNOW
WHAT MUSCLE YOU PULLED.

39:08.780 --> 39:12.083
- I'M AFRAID I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.052
- THE PROBLEM IS,
THAT UNLESS MR. TAYLOR

39:14.085 --> 39:15.854
IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE
HIS STUDIES,

39:15.887 --> 39:17.055
THE WORLD IS GOING
TO BE DEPRIVED

39:17.088 --> 39:19.057
OF HIS STAGGERING GIFT.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.959
- AND THAT WOULD BE A SHAME.

39:20.992 --> 39:22.861
- IS THERE ANY WAY
THAT I CAN DEFER TUITION

39:22.894 --> 39:24.996
UNTIL I CAN FIGURE OUT SOME WAY
TO GET A LOAN?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.398
- YOU DON'T NEED A LOAN.

39:26.432 --> 39:27.833
- HOW ELSE
IS HE SUPPOSED TO PAY?

39:27.866 --> 39:29.167
- IT'S ALREADY BEEN PAID.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.939
IT'S IN YOUR FILE.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.475
- YOU--YOU SAID
YOUR ASSHOLE FATHER REFUSED.

39:36.508 --> 39:39.845
- HE DID.
I MEAN, I THOUGHT HE DID.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.580
- WELL, APPARENTLY HE CHANGED
HIS MIND.

39:41.613 --> 39:45.016
- WELL, WHATEVER YOU SAID
TO HIM, IT WORKED.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.485
[loud kissing]

39:46.518 --> 39:48.854
- CONGRATULATIONS, MR. TAYLOR.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.790
THE WORLD CAN NOW ANTICIPATE
YOUR GIFT.

39:51.823 --> 39:55.694
- [chuckles]

39:55.727 --> 40:00.832
- THAT'S JUST STANDING UP,
SAME AS ANY MAN'LL DO.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.034
- AND YOU THINK THAT TO KILL HIM

40:03.068 --> 40:05.971
WILL MAKE YOU A MAN?

40:06.004 --> 40:08.173
- [mouthing along]
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.841
BUT I KNOW THAT I THOUGHT
ABOUT HIM

40:09.875 --> 40:12.778
EVERY DAY FOR FIVE YEARS.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.914
AND THAT WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT KEPT ME GOING.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.650
[banging on door]

40:18.684 --> 40:20.852
- DO YOU?

40:20.886 --> 40:22.788
THERE ARE NOT MANY CHANCES
IN LIFE

40:22.821 --> 40:24.990
TO BE HAPPY.

40:25.023 --> 40:28.660
AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE
A GOOD ONE NOW.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.729
WON'T YOU TRY TO FORGET THIS--

40:30.762 --> 40:33.465
- YOU PLANNING ON COMING IN?

40:37.703 --> 40:42.140
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE,
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE HERE.

40:42.173 --> 40:45.877
- FOR A CHANGE.

40:45.911 --> 40:49.948
IS THAT A NEW COFFEE TABLE?

40:49.981 --> 40:53.785
- MIES VAN DER ROHE.
- HMM.

40:53.819 --> 40:59.558
MUST HAVE COST A FORTUNE.
- YEP.

40:59.591 --> 41:02.193
- I WENT BY THE BURSAR'S OFFICE
TODAY.

41:02.227 --> 41:05.030
I CAN'T ACCEPT IT.

41:05.063 --> 41:07.232
- WHAT?
- TUITION.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.501
- OH, THAT.

41:09.535 --> 41:11.637
WHY, IS SOMEONE ELSE
COVERING IT?

41:11.670 --> 41:13.605
- NO.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.574
- WELL, THEN YOU CAN'T AFFORD
NOT TO.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.042
- BUT WE'RE NOT TOGETHER
ANYMORE.

41:17.075 --> 41:18.209
- WE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.611
I'LL PAY FOR YOUR SCHOOL.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.513
YOU PAY ME BACK
WITH INTEREST.

41:21.547 --> 41:25.116
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO HONOR IT.

41:25.150 --> 41:29.855
- A DEAL'S A DEAL.

41:29.888 --> 41:31.857
- I COULD BE POOR
FOR A LONG TIME.

41:31.890 --> 41:35.060
- YEAH, WELL, KNOWING YOUR
TASTES, YOU'D BETTER NOT BE.

41:35.093 --> 41:36.628
- IT'S NOT
LIKE I HAVE A SHITLOAD

41:36.662 --> 41:40.866
OF GREAT MONEYMAKING
OPPORTUNITIES.

41:40.899 --> 41:43.569
- YOU HAVE ONE.

41:48.707 --> 41:52.077
AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING?

41:52.110 --> 41:53.311
- THANK YOU.

41:53.344 --> 41:57.649
- NOT THAT.
THAT.

41:57.683 --> 42:01.286
YOUR COMPUTER.
I PACKED IT FOR YOU.

42:01.319 --> 42:02.888
- IT'S YOURS.

42:02.921 --> 42:05.123
- BULLSHIT.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.325
YOU NEED IT.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.962
TAKE IT.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.585
- THE GRANDFATHER CLAUSE?

42:33.619 --> 42:36.187
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D USE
SUCH A LUDICROUS EXCUSE!

42:36.221 --> 42:39.124
- IT SEEMED TO MAKE SENSE
WHEN BRIAN EXPLAINED IT.

42:39.157 --> 42:40.926
- OR THAT YOU'D EVEN GO TO...

42:40.959 --> 42:43.862
GULDEN'S HOUSE TO TELL HIM
YOU COULDN'T SEE HIM.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.731
- DIJON.
- YEAH, WHATEVER!

42:45.764 --> 42:47.065
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE PHONE?

42:47.098 --> 42:48.667
COREY,
DON'T RUB IT RAW, OKAY?

42:48.700 --> 42:49.668
YOU'VE GOT
ANOTHER HOUR AND A HALF.

42:49.701 --> 42:50.936
WOULD YOU GO, PLEASE?

42:50.969 --> 42:53.004
[men moaning]

42:53.038 --> 42:55.974
[mixed chatter]

43:02.814 --> 43:04.349
- YOU KNOW THE ONE THING I WISH

43:04.382 --> 43:07.686
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW?

43:07.719 --> 43:11.723
I WISH THAT I COULD TALK
TO MY BEST FRIEND TEDDY.

43:13.859 --> 43:19.097
HE'S ALWAYS SO WISE AND CARING.

43:19.130 --> 43:21.833
ONLY NOW HE'S MY BOYFRIEND,
AND...

43:21.867 --> 43:23.769
WELL, THERE'S
JUST SOME THINGS

43:23.802 --> 43:25.771
YOU CAN'T SAY TO YOUR BOYFRIEND,
NO MATTER

43:25.804 --> 43:27.739
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HIM.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.182
- ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?

43:37.215 --> 43:40.986
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

43:41.019 --> 43:42.688
I MEAN, I MUST BE CRAZY.

43:42.721 --> 43:47.092
I NO SOONER GET TOGETHER
WITH THIS REALLY WONDERFUL GUY

43:47.125 --> 43:49.127
THAN I GO AND DO SOMETHING

43:49.160 --> 43:53.865
WITH SOMEONE THAT MEANS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ME.

43:53.899 --> 43:57.869
- I MEAN,
WHY DO I DO THESE THINGS?

44:00.405 --> 44:03.208
- BECAUSE YOU NEVER MET A COCK
YOU DIDN'T LIKE.

44:03.241 --> 44:05.877
- [chuckles bitterly]

44:05.911 --> 44:07.145
- IT'S PART OF YOUR CHARM,

44:07.178 --> 44:11.116
SO DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

44:13.018 --> 44:16.154
THAT'S YOUR BEST FRIEND
SPEAKING.

44:16.187 --> 44:17.422
BUT AS YOUR BOYFRIEND,

44:17.455 --> 44:19.224
I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHAT YOU DID

44:19.257 --> 44:22.160
WAS A FLAGRANT BETRAYAL.

44:22.193 --> 44:27.032
I'M NOT SURE
THAT I CAN EVER TRUST YOU AGAIN.

44:27.065 --> 44:31.036
THEN AGAIN,
AS YOUR BEST FRIEND,

44:31.069 --> 44:33.972
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT YOU'D
GIVE IN TO TEMPTATION.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.174
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN SINGLE
ALL THESE YEARS.

44:36.207 --> 44:40.779
IT'S NOT EASY
TO JUST SETTLE DOWN OVERNIGHT.

44:40.812 --> 44:41.913
STILL, IT'S ONE THING
TO KNOW THAT

44:41.947 --> 44:43.448
AS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

44:43.481 --> 44:47.418
IT'S ANOTHER THING TO ACCEPT IT
AS YOUR LOVER.

44:51.022 --> 44:54.860
- I'M SORRY, TEDDY,

44:54.893 --> 44:58.063
FOR HURTING YOU

44:58.096 --> 45:04.035
AND FOR DESTROYING
WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE HAD.

45:20.986 --> 45:23.154

TO PLAY A NOTE
SO LOUD AND SO HIGH

47:18.636 --> 47:20.906
