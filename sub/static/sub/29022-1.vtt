     money we offer him.

24:57.930 --> 25:01.098
 That's why I haven't spoken
 to him. But I'm not worried.

25:01.100 --> 25:04.001

  vote without the deacons.

          My pleasure.

           LORETTA:
     Veronica and I were
just talking about the votes.

25:19.819 --> 25:23.287
   Oh, okay. So let me sum
 up what we are facing here.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.823
      The charter of the
   church allows the pastor

25:25.825 --> 25:29.093
  to make decisions without
  involvement of the board,

25:29.095 --> 25:32.730
    except for relocation,
 denomination, and financial

25:32.732 --> 25:34.965
   expenditures over $10,000.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.135
     So in order to move
    forward on any matter

25:38.137 --> 25:40.237
      that falls within
      these exceptions,

25:40.239 --> 25:43.207
    a vote of yes from two
   out of the three boards

25:43.209 --> 25:45.543
   and the pastor is needed.

25:45.545 --> 25:48.779
    Now Loretta, I'm quite
sure you'll handle the pastor.

25:48.781 --> 25:52.016
      Of course. How do
  you think we got this far?

25:52.018 --> 25:54.585
        Great, great.
  Has anyone spoken to Joan?

25:54.587 --> 25:56.320
    We're definitely gonna
  need the stewardess board

25:56.322 --> 25:58.622
       because it will
     be almost impossible

25:58.624 --> 26:00.291
 to have the deacons on board.

26:00.293 --> 26:03.093
   That's what Loretta was
 saying before you came over.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.930
   That Deacon Williams, he
  is an Old Testament stiff.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.966
If it was up to him, he would
 live and die in that church.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.035
           -Mm-hmm.
  -But I did speak to Joan,

26:11.037 --> 26:14.271

the seeds with the stewardess.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.208

  little trip to the church.

           -Really?
            -Yep.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.645
