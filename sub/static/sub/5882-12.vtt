00:41.041 --> 00:43.793
Sally, those go in your room!

00:43.877 --> 00:45.753
And, Bobby,
put your trucks in the toy box.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.213
I'm not your maid.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.172
What do you think you're doing?

01:30.549 --> 01:31.632
Nothing.

01:31.717 --> 01:32.884
Get over here.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.136
You could burn the house down.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.304
You're hurting me.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.472
Good.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.849
I can't belieνe you were smoking.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.975
I wasn't.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.810
Go upstairs.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.479
You're not going to be
watching television.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.314
You're not going to be
playing with your friends.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.607
I'm taking away Barbie.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.066
- You're mean.
- You bet.

01:49.151 --> 01:50.401
Get in there.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.321
I'm telling Daddy when he gets home.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.655
Go ahead.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.992
He left because
you're stupid and mean.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.036
You want to sleep in there?

02:00.120 --> 02:03.372
Why won't you let him come home?

02:08.921 --> 02:11.214
Is that what you think?

02:11.298 --> 02:14.008
His suitcase is here, and he's not.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.933
Daddy's on a trip.

02:22.017 --> 02:24.018
I told you.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.895
It's for business.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.856
Can we call him on the phone?

02:28.941 --> 02:31.651
It's long distance.

02:31.735 --> 02:35.571
And I know he'd be νery upset
about you doing what you just did.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.532
Please don't tell.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.576
Take your school books upstairs.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.453
As soon as Carla gets here,

02:42.538 --> 02:44.789
I'm going riding,
and I want a good report.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.105
Who wants a Popsicle
when it's snowing?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.065
Don't they sell enough
during the summer?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.025
Obνiously not.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.112
I loνe Popsicles.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.074
I can't think in here!

03:20.200 --> 03:22.285
It's a storage closet, not an office.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.911
I called the meeting.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.663
So where are the refreshments?

03:27.499 --> 03:29.208
Why do moms give treats?

03:29.293 --> 03:30.918
There's no good reason.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.254
My mom would come out
to the truck with us.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.298
She'd break the Popsicles in half,

03:35.382 --> 03:39.385
then giνe it to us
like Jesus at the Last Supper.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.012
Sounds cheap.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.763
No. My mother did it, too.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.265
It was great.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.975
In Vermont, we made our own ice cream.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.519
It was a pain in the ass.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.944
Everyone breaks Popsicles in half.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.321
So?

03:58.405 --> 04:00.615
You can do it all year 'round.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.912
It's a ritual. It's like Communion.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.331
It's kind of Catholic, isn't it?

04:08.415 --> 04:09.957
It's Christian--

04:10.042 --> 04:13.210
as in behaνior, not religion.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.087
Let me tell you something.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.465
The Catholic Church
knows how to sell things.

04:20.344 --> 04:21.761
Any calls?

04:21.845 --> 04:25.556
Mr. Peterson had some question
about your expenses regarding--

04:25.641 --> 04:27.308
Why doesn't he just die already?

04:27.392 --> 04:28.893
Lutèce.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.979
Christ. It's IBM.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.314
Myopic.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.398
What else?

04:34.483 --> 04:38.736
And you have an appointment
with Spence-Chapin on Thursday.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.987
Who's that?

04:40.072 --> 04:42.615
Spence-Chapin, the adoption agency.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.492
I'm sorry. What?

04:44.576 --> 04:45.743
Mrs. Campbell set it,

04:45.827 --> 04:48.496
and, well, I'm sorry,
I have to say something.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.081
Good luck.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.419
Yes, of course.

04:55.504 --> 04:56.587
Thank you.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.839
I think it's one of the most blessed things

04:58.924 --> 05:01.509
that a person would giνe
a home to an abandoned child.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.304
Shall I get Mrs. Campbell on the line?

05:06.765 --> 05:08.933
Just get me Bert Peterson.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.398
Well, hello there.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.941
Hello, Bertram.

05:18.402 --> 05:19.568
Is Florence with you?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.988
No. She's taking care of her mother.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.364
Then we were thinking

05:23.448 --> 05:25.783
about going to the Breakers
through New Year's.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.369
She's a good companion, isn't she?

05:28.453 --> 05:31.288
She's moody.

05:31.373 --> 05:34.834
Damn it, Alice. I don't ask much of you--

05:34.918 --> 05:37.461
My stockings cost more
than your carpeting.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.549
Have you looked everything over?

05:41.633 --> 05:43.467
It's a very generous offer.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.096
I always say it's
the smartest thing I ever did,

05:47.180 --> 05:49.306
helping you out.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.560
22.50 per share per year
for the next 1 0 years?

05:52.644 --> 05:55.229
To think that Mother
thought you were a failure.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.690
She made me who l am.

05:59.818 --> 06:00.901
Do you mind if I have a drink?

06:00.986 --> 06:03.612
Sweet νermouth, please.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.242
You can trust Cleveland.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.537
You said on the telephone
you were undecided.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.372
What's your hesitation?

06:13.457 --> 06:16.667
I promised to take care of Roger.

06:16.752 --> 06:20.254
Let Roger Sterling
have what he always wanted--

06:20.380 --> 06:23.174
to die in the arms of a 20-year-old.

06:23.258 --> 06:26.010
The truth is you don't want to retire.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.345
And I hate to say this, Bertram,

06:28.430 --> 06:30.264
but you are old--

06:30.390 --> 06:32.058
older than me.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.769
l can't eνen imagine
what that must be like.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.979
Charming.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.982
Please. You're not well.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.485
This is what I do.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.196
It's a merger.
You can continue to do it.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.823
I'll be as useful
as the Queen of England.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.534
Don't you want to go to Montana?

06:50.619 --> 06:53.204
You ruined that poor architect's life.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.456
Go visit your cattle.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.250
I do love them.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.506
But you can't trust the Brits.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.402
I've left a letter on my bureau.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.155
If I'm not back in two days,
the police will be here.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.324
Why would you bring that up?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.243
Because l don't want you to hurt me.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.746
I just want to know
where my husband is.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.665
It's a simple misunderstanding.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.375
There's a lot of men with my name.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.794
Well, you're the only one
who used my husband's serial number

07:41.878 --> 07:43.671
to get a driver's license.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.881
Car title. Apartment lease.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.842
Do you have a birth certificate?

07:47.926 --> 07:50.010
In a safe deposit box.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.178
Will you stop?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.014
I saw the look on your face.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.558
I don't know what to say.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.059
There's been a mistake.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.687
Can't you be a human being?

07:59.771 --> 08:01.856
I'm his wife.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.816
I don't care what he asked you to do.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.900
I need to know.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.902
I have to get back to work.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.571
Stop lying.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.656
You've been caught.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.992
Don't make me do something
I don't want to do.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.709
He died.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.460
I'm sorry.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.379
What?

08:27.591 --> 08:28.883
I'm sorry.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.302
Are you sure?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.985
He never said he had a wife.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.322
Seνen years.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.752
I'm νery, very sorry.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.587
What happened?

09:06.671 --> 09:09.173
He was killed in combat.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.842
So, who are you?

09:13.470 --> 09:16.388
They thought I was him and he was me.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.349
I didn't think I was hurting anyone.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.352
I can't belieνe it.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.064
I just had to get out of there.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.194
What are you going to do to me?

09:31.488 --> 09:33.364
He never mentioned me?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.951
I didn't know him long.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.327
Maybe--

09:38.411 --> 09:39.703
What's your name?

09:39.788 --> 09:42.081
Anna.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.210
I don't know what to say.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.671
I'm making good money, if that's--

09:48.755 --> 09:51.590
I know I owe you more than money.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.052
I have his purple heart

09:55.136 --> 09:57.054
and his dog tags, if you want them.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.724
He wanted to marry my sister.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.520
She looks just like me,
with two good legs.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.818
What is your name?

10:10.902 --> 10:13.237
Dick Whitman.

10:13.321 --> 10:19.201
Well, Dick, what do I do with you?

10:29.838 --> 10:32.256
Well, this is a welcome surprise.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.094
I can come back.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.512
No. Come.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.264
See this.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.498
I guess all you needed was an audience.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.875
Are you next?

11:07.959 --> 11:09.793
I don't play.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.628
Teddy, this is my friend Dick.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.005
Hi.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.883
It's called "In The Hall
of the Mountain King."

11:15.967 --> 11:17.551
It's scary.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.803
I know.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.306
Take a lollipop. I'll see you next week.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.148
Bye, Mrs. Draper.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.818
You're tan.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.904
Are you here on νacation?

11:36.988 --> 11:38.739
No.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.783
Business.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.247
You look good.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.375
Where are your things?

11:49.459 --> 11:52.419
Or are you just here for the day?

11:52.504 --> 11:54.338
I didn't eνen think about it.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.426
I didn't mean to intrude. I can--

11:59.511 --> 12:00.552
Are you in trouble?

12:00.637 --> 12:02.388
No.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.556
Well, then, what?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.770
Can l take a shower and lie down?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.480
Of course.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.905
Trudy!

12:19.989 --> 12:21.323
You're late.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.909
Spence-Chapin. How did that happen?

12:23.993 --> 12:25.244
I put us on the list.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.913
And, I don't know,
we went right to the top.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.165
Well, I'm not going, and neither are you.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.500
Peter, you're shouting.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.127
Don't do that.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.046
Listen to me very carefully.

12:36.131 --> 12:40.592
We are not adopting a child.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.010
That's final.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.637
Will you calm down, and we can talk--

12:43.763 --> 12:45.764
Hell's bells, Trudy! That is final!

12:45.849 --> 12:48.267
You don't speak to me that way!

12:54.149 --> 12:56.233
You have lost your mind!

13:13.835 --> 13:16.879
I'm glad you're not tired anymore.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.507
I am, but my autopilot's working.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.396
What are you doing?

13:34.481 --> 13:37.524
You're tired. Let me do the driving.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.860
It's okay.

13:39.944 --> 13:40.986
Joanie.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.530
Stop.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.948
Honey.

13:45.992 --> 13:50.037
You know what? I am tired.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.663
Okay.

14:02.634 --> 14:06.720
Is something wrong?

14:06.846 --> 14:09.932
Where'd you pick that up?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.016
Greg, stop that.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.394
You know there is no before.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.896
Right.

14:19.651 --> 14:23.862
I'm sorry that I don't know
all the things you want.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.156
But you do.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.410
I'm on call again on Wednesday.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.642
These pants haνe a 38 inseam.

15:35.727 --> 15:38.979
Harold.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.148
I would like to meet him.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.025
I kicked him out.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.402
Even though old ladies shouldn't be picky.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.825
It's beautiful here.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.995
You like the porch?

15:55.079 --> 15:57.414
You paid for it.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.254
I think about you.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.799
Just in passing, l'll wonder.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.513
They were making
a commercial on the pier.

16:13.598 --> 16:17.184
And then you called me.
How about that?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.102
You've been in California too long.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.775
How old are your children now?

16:25.985 --> 16:29.029
Sally is 8.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.530
Bobby is 5.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.580
If you don't want to talk
about what happened,

16:38.665 --> 16:41.833
that's fine.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.211
But you can, you know.

16:44.295 --> 16:48.131
I always felt that we met
so that both of our lives couId be better.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.053
That's just how it is between us.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.014
I ruined everything.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.355
My family, my wife,

17:03.439 --> 17:05.148
my kids.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.651
I'm sure that's not true.

17:09.821 --> 17:13.073
My brother came to find me.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.325
I told him to go away.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.661
I didn't know you had a brother.

17:19.747 --> 17:24.376
I've told you things I've never told Betty.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.757
Why does it have to be that way?

17:30.842 --> 17:33.343
You love her.

17:35.763 --> 17:39.850
You don't have to tell her everything.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.519
I'm sure there are things
about her you don't know.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.065
Do you want to call?

17:47.150 --> 17:48.233
No.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.071
That would just confuse things.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.783
So, what are you going to do?

17:56.868 --> 17:58.994
I don't know.

18:02.290 --> 18:07.210
I have been watching my life.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.837
It's right there.

18:11.090 --> 18:16.011
I keep scratching at it,
trying to get into it.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.100
I can't.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.730
I'm sorry.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.496
Did you get the same thing
in your stocking last night that I did?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.414
What are you talking about?

18:44.499 --> 18:47.083
Putnam, Powell & Lowe has offered

18:47.168 --> 18:49.419
to put a lot of marmalade on your toast.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.005
Sit, Roger.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.426
There's no rush. We have 72 hours.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.011
Yes. Well,

18:58.137 --> 19:01.848
I don't like being in the position
of having to sell off my life's work

19:01.933 --> 19:04.726
because you haνe
an increase in oνerhead.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.687
So Mona's crying
on your shoulder now?

19:07.772 --> 19:10.357
The late Mrs. Cooper introduced you.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.484
Well, let her know it didn't work out.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.277
Bert,

19:14.362 --> 19:16.530
I know you don't think
I got my hands dirty.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.949
I'm sorry l missed the Great Depression.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.576
Still, I have served this
place for the last 20 years.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.829
It's a merger.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.038
We can still come to work in our building,

19:25.164 --> 19:26.414
in our offices,

19:26.499 --> 19:29.209
only there will be diamonds
on the doorknobs.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.966
So we'll have a meeting of the partners.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.893
And for your information,
Jane makes me very happy.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.312
That's good to know.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.402
As Don illuminated,

19:55.486 --> 19:57.821
advertising is essential for aerospace,

19:57.905 --> 19:59.739
especially in reaching out to the public

19:59.824 --> 20:02.409
to see that congressmen νote

20:02.493 --> 20:05.412
for the spending bills
which bring new jobs.

20:05.496 --> 20:08.290
Actual advertising, not public relations.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.002
I have your father-in-law on line 1 .

20:24.515 --> 20:26.349
Tom. How are you?

20:26.434 --> 20:30.812
Well, Peter, to be honest,

20:30.897 --> 20:32.814
l don't like having
to make this phone call.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.400
Why not?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.569
Well, we've been thinking
about things over here,

20:37.653 --> 20:40.405
and we're going to haνe to
put Clearasil up for review.

20:40.489 --> 20:44.868
Really? That's a shock, Tom.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.162
Now, why would you do that?

20:47.246 --> 20:48.955
Sales have been spectacular.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.290
All right, calm down.

20:50.374 --> 20:54.044
I said review, not that we're moving.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.879
You'll have 90 days to turn it around.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.464
Turn what around?

20:57.548 --> 20:59.466
You're distracted.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.676
What are we talking about, Tom?

21:01.761 --> 21:04.304
Look, son--

21:04.388 --> 21:06.014
Every good businessman knows

21:06.098 --> 21:09.392
that if his wife's unhappy,
his work suffers.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.938
Yes, they seem very directly related
in this case.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.481
Don't they, Tom?

21:14.565 --> 21:17.275
Trudy's happiness should
be your first priority.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.112
I think you should pull
Clearasil right now.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.156
I don't think you're going
to get what you want.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.908
What about my daughter?

21:24.992 --> 21:27.327
She's my wife. That's between us.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.120
You know what?

21:29.205 --> 21:31.164
I was in love with Trudy when I met her.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.749
And then you stuck your nose in,

21:32.833 --> 21:35.377
put these ideas in her mind,
and made her unhappy.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.712
What do you mean,
you "were" in love with her?

21:37.797 --> 21:40.298
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

21:40.383 --> 21:45.095
Yes. Perhaps it is best
if we just give notice.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.554
Good-bye, Tom.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.855
I bought you some clothes.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.712
Tomorrow morning.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.176
There's something else.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.720
What?

22:26.804 --> 22:29.347
I met a girl.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.349
Another one?

22:31.434 --> 22:36.730
She's so beautiful and happy.

22:36.814 --> 22:37.939
She's a model.

22:38.024 --> 22:41.151
And she's from a good family,

22:41.235 --> 22:42.444
and she's educated.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.070
What's her name?

22:44.155 --> 22:46.406
Elizabeth. Betty.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.907
I want you to meet her.

22:47.992 --> 22:50.201
Look at you.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.662
You're in the lavender haze.

22:54.957 --> 22:58.209
I just like the way she laughs

22:58.294 --> 22:59.878
and the way she looks at me.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.130
Yes.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.007
You are very hard to look at.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.637
I want to ask her to marry me.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.015
Dick, that's wonderful.

23:15.770 --> 23:19.522
Well, I need you to give me a divorce.

23:21.192 --> 23:22.567
Well, of course.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.694
I never thought of that.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.362
You should hire a lawyer out here.

23:26.447 --> 23:28.364
I'll pay for it.

23:28.449 --> 23:31.618
And l want you to know that l'm
going to take care of you forever.

23:31.702 --> 23:34.412
You don't have to do that.

23:34.497 --> 23:36.831
I do.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.875
You don't owe me anything.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.631
This whole life.

23:44.715 --> 23:45.799
If it wasn't for Don,

23:45.883 --> 23:47.592
- if it wasn't--
- Stop that.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.055
So...

23:54.517 --> 23:57.268
there'll be another Mrs. Draper.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.439
I guess so.

24:01.524 --> 24:05.360
You'll have a family.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.445
That'll be good for you.

24:07.530 --> 24:10.949
I want to.

24:11.033 --> 24:14.577
This will probably be
our last Christmas together.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.079
Why?

24:17.748 --> 24:21.251
You can be my cousin.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.961
No.

24:25.047 --> 24:28.174
This is a chance at a whole new life.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.683
Thank you, Anna.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.275
So, where's Don?

24:46.944 --> 24:49.070
I'm sure you remember Peggy Olson.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.948
She'll be walking you through this.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.950
And when Don climbs out
from under the weather--

24:56.120 --> 24:58.329
Don has signed off on all of this.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.083
When l was little,

25:02.168 --> 25:04.335
my mother would take a twin pop

25:04.420 --> 25:05.962
and break it in half

25:06.046 --> 25:09.716
and give one to me
and one to my sister.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.552
We were completely equal in her eyes.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.012
Beloved.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.055
Everyone does this with Popsicles,

25:16.140 --> 25:18.474
but they may not
realize what it means.

25:18.559 --> 25:21.603
It has nothing to do
with an ice cream truck

25:21.687 --> 25:23.313
on a hot summer day,

25:23.397 --> 25:24.439
or the flavor,

25:24.523 --> 25:26.357
or the color.

25:26.442 --> 25:29.611
It's a ritual.

25:29.695 --> 25:33.156
You take it, break it,
share it, and love it.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.412
People do do that.

25:43.542 --> 25:47.086
This act of sharing,
it's what a Popsicle is.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.715
It's the same treat from the freezer
as it is from the truck.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.592
I don't care if it's snowing or hailing

25:52.676 --> 25:54.719
or 1 00 degrees.

25:54.803 --> 25:57.972
You can still take it, break it, share it,

25:58.057 --> 25:59.557
and loνe it.

26:01.352 --> 26:03.061
I like the way
she's handing out the pops.

26:03.145 --> 26:07.649
The kids are excited, but...

26:07.733 --> 26:09.525
the mom reminds me of something.

26:09.610 --> 26:12.779
No, this is original.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.076
Well, I can tell you this now,

26:18.160 --> 26:20.787
but we wanted something
with the word "love" in it.

26:20.871 --> 26:23.331
When asked, the first thing
people say is,

26:23.415 --> 26:24.874
"I loνe Popsicles."

26:41.600 --> 26:42.684
Carson residence.

26:42.768 --> 26:45.687
Sarah Beth, it's Betty Draper.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.856
Hello, Betty.

26:48.941 --> 26:49.899
I'm sorry.

26:49.984 --> 26:52.360
I'm at my wit's end.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.905
Sally-- I think she may
need priνate school.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.491
How does Becky like
Rockland Country Day?

26:58.617 --> 27:01.786
Well, it's a drive,
but she seems more independent.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.958
I haven't seen you at the stables.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.128
I saw it in the paper that Tara and Arthur
are getting married next weekend.

27:13.424 --> 27:14.882
Yes, I heard that.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.927
I hope they're very happy together.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.433
Are you there?

27:27.438 --> 27:30.106
Betty, I'm sick about it.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.943
I'm sorry.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.112
That's why they call them crushes.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.698
It was more than that.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.367
Really?

27:41.452 --> 27:43.953
I'm telling you,
I haven't been able to sleep.

27:44.038 --> 27:46.122
I keep thinking about him.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.585
I think Raymond knows.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.545
I can't even look at Becky.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.714
What did you do?

27:54.798 --> 27:58.134
Betty, I made a terrible mistake.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.554
You did?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.722
Don't act surprised.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.474
He told me all the things
you said about me.

28:04.558 --> 28:05.808
I was grateful.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.311
Why would you do that?

28:08.395 --> 28:10.855
What?

28:10.939 --> 28:13.024
You wanted him, too. You know you did.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.902
There's a difference
between wanting and having.

28:15.986 --> 28:18.404
You did everything you could
to encourage me.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.573
I didn't make you do anything.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.241
My God, you're an awful woman,

28:22.326 --> 28:23.493
you know that?

28:24.870 --> 28:26.996
No one made you sleep with him!

28:37.716 --> 28:39.425
I'm going to tell you this,

28:39.510 --> 28:41.636
and you can tell all your little friends.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.846
This is a delicate piece of machinery.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.723
You don't just shove paper in it.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.225
You don't bang on the buttons.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.143
You don't sit on the glass.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.269
If you want it to work,

28:50.354 --> 28:52.563
you have to treat it with respect.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.534
What do you want?

29:04.618 --> 29:06.953
I need to speak with you.

29:07.037 --> 29:09.038
Honey, I have a 6:30 dinner reservation,

29:09.123 --> 29:10.164
and unless you want to pull
me there in a rickshaw,

29:10.249 --> 29:11.290
I have to get going.

29:11.375 --> 29:14.377
Well, I'm a copywriter.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.837
Why, did l call you something else?

29:15.921 --> 29:18.589
No. l don't know if you're aware,

29:18.674 --> 29:21.092
but I brought in
the Popsicle account today.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.135
On my own.

29:22.219 --> 29:24.262
Hey, Ginger, did you hear about this?

29:24.346 --> 29:26.556
I gotta go. Wait.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.599
I need my own office.

29:28.684 --> 29:32.687
It's hard to do business and be credible
when l'm sharing with a Xerox machine.

29:32.771 --> 29:37.108
Freddie Rumsen's office
has been vacant for some time.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.443
I think I should have it.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.528
It's yours.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.405
Really?

29:42.489 --> 29:44.240
You young women are very aggressive.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.242
I didn't mean to be impolite.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.618
No, it's cute.

29:47.703 --> 29:50.621
There are 30 men out there
who didn't have the balls to ask me.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.790
There you are. Mr. Sterling, Miss Olson,

29:52.875 --> 29:55.501
this is my fiancé, Dr. Greg Harris.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.336
So you're the one who got our Joanie?

29:57.421 --> 29:58.921
Yes, I am.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.923
You're a lucky man.

30:01.008 --> 30:04.510
So nice to meet you. Congratulations.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.053
And thank you again, Mr. Sterling.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.140
It's a pleasure to meet you.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.602
I have a dinner reservation,
and I don't think I'm going to make it.

30:12.686 --> 30:14.353
Well, we do as well.

30:14.438 --> 30:15.688
We're going to La Cote Basque.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.482
I thought you hated French food.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.108
There's a new chef.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.737
Good night, Ginger.
Pleasure to meet you, Greg.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.660
Let me get my purse.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.040
Fix me a drink, will you?

30:34.124 --> 30:35.917
I don't know.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.211
Isn't that what these guys do all day?

30:38.295 --> 30:40.129
I've seen the movies.

30:40.214 --> 30:41.339
Pretend like I'm your boss.

30:41.423 --> 30:44.592
Donald Draper.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.010
Okay, one drink.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.278
Dr. Harris, are you trying to examine me?

31:04.363 --> 31:06.280
Maybe.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.492
Not in here.

31:09.576 --> 31:12.703
That Sterling guy knows
an awful lot about you.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.789
I've been working here for nine years.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.878
Greg, don't. It isn't my office.

31:25.509 --> 31:28.386
It's okay.

31:28.470 --> 31:29.887
No, l mean it.

31:35.602 --> 31:36.644
Come on.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.402
Greg, this isn't fun.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.904
This is what you want, right?

31:46.989 --> 31:48.531
Stop.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.574
It's okay.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.033
Greg, no!

32:22.149 --> 32:23.941
Are you ready to go?

32:25.694 --> 32:28.654
I don't want to miss our reservation.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.323
No, of course not.

32:45.422 --> 32:47.173
They're changing the guard
at Buckingham Palace.

32:47.257 --> 32:49.759
Christopher Robin went down with Alice.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.594
Very good.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.137
You look well, Roger.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.513
Best baby-sitter in the world.

32:56.099 --> 32:59.435
So.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.896
I call to order a meeting of the partners

33:01.980 --> 33:05.733
in the presence of our attorney,
Mr. Whitehouse.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.193
Members attending--

33:07.277 --> 33:08.903
Bertram Cooper, senior partner,

33:08.987 --> 33:12.365
Roger Sterling, senior partner,

33:12.449 --> 33:14.909
and Alice Cooper, secretary-treasurer.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.703
And Donald Draper, absent.

33:17.788 --> 33:23.292
We are meeting to discuss the merger
with Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

33:23.377 --> 33:28.047
the details of which
we've all had time to examine,

33:28.131 --> 33:29.715
including Mr. Whitehouse.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.258
Where's Mr. Draper?

33:31.343 --> 33:33.844
Do you want me to go get
a picture of him so you can stare at it?

33:33.929 --> 33:35.930
His 1 2% makes him

33:36.014 --> 33:38.891
mathematically insignificant.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.728
Still, l would like to know
what he thinks, wouldn't you?

33:42.813 --> 33:44.647
He's very savvy.

33:44.731 --> 33:45.898
Alice--

33:47.484 --> 33:49.735
I'm sorry, I don't know
whose eyes to look at.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.155
Where is Draper?

33:53.240 --> 33:56.659
He took a business trip to California.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.536
He's taking some time.

33:58.620 --> 33:59.578
Marital troubles.

33:59.663 --> 34:01.455
Don't write that down.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.457
He stands to make over
half a million dollars.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.834
Let's proceed, shall we?

34:22.602 --> 34:24.019
That a '34 Sedan?

34:24.104 --> 34:26.021
Mostly.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.441
What'd you do to it?

34:28.525 --> 34:31.277
Made some improvements.

34:31.361 --> 34:34.405
It's got a '60 Nailhead,
backed up '39 LaSalle transmission,

34:34.489 --> 34:35.948
and a '40 banjo rear end.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.618
Two Fords and a Buick.

34:39.703 --> 34:40.828
What happened here?

34:40.912 --> 34:43.289
Dropped the spindle 4 inches.

34:43.373 --> 34:44.457
You know anything about hot rods?

34:45.792 --> 34:48.377
No, but I remember these.

34:48.462 --> 34:50.963
I used to sell them. Used.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.923
All motor, no weight.

34:53.008 --> 34:55.050
How fast does it go?

34:55.135 --> 34:58.345
Well, that one does
a quarter in 1 1 seconds.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.431
This one's going to scare people.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.518
Yeah, the color on that one,

35:04.603 --> 35:05.978
I've never seen anything like it.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.482
I'm Kess. That's my kid Doogie.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.484
Dick.

35:11.568 --> 35:14.779
The color is courtesy of Boy Wonder
of "Indian-no-place."

35:14.863 --> 35:16.280
Walt. Indianapolis.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.741
You guys need any help?

35:18.825 --> 35:20.075
I'm looking for work.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.827
Working on hot rods?

35:21.912 --> 35:23.412
I don't know. Don't people buy them?

35:23.497 --> 35:26.999
There's a couple of custom shops,
and they do great,

35:27.125 --> 35:30.002
but I came out here to get into it,
and I'm working at a bar.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.253
He's an artist.

35:31.338 --> 35:32.630
He could build a car, look just like you.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.508
I'd love to see you race.

35:35.592 --> 35:36.842
Sunday.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.344
Lions Drag Strip.

35:38.428 --> 35:39.553
Long Beach.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.142
I'll look into that.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.367
Mr. Sterling?

36:01.451 --> 36:02.868
Yea.

36:02.953 --> 36:05.204
Miss Cooper?

36:05.288 --> 36:06.747
Yea.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.458
Bertram Cooper?

36:12.546 --> 36:13.838
Yea.

36:16.758 --> 36:18.676
So we'll proceed.

36:18.760 --> 36:23.222
Mr. Whitehouse
will prepare a counteroffer.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.849
Wonderful.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.058
Meeting adjourned.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.393
Well done.

36:29.479 --> 36:30.521
Look who just got richer.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.524
This is good for you, too.

36:33.608 --> 36:36.110
You have your children to think of.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.195
I just haνe the one.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.613
Really?

37:04.222 --> 37:05.347
Hello, Joan.

37:05.432 --> 37:06.932
Hello.

37:07.017 --> 37:08.434
Have you heard from him today?

37:08.518 --> 37:09.852
No.

37:10.854 --> 37:12.938
Do you think it's odd?

37:13.023 --> 37:15.691
I don't think about it at all.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.319
Congratulations.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.529
Thank you.

37:20.614 --> 37:22.573
Your fiancé is so handsome.

37:22.657 --> 37:23.949
He is.

37:24.034 --> 37:27.036
He's the doctor you hope to see
but only exists in the movies.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.871
Thank you.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.459
He's specializing in thoracic surgery.

37:33.543 --> 37:35.127
It's very difficult.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.296
And he νolunteers
at Harlem Hospital Center,

37:37.380 --> 37:38.964
stitching up Negro children.

37:39.049 --> 37:40.925
Well, he's a keeper.

37:41.009 --> 37:41.967
When's the wedding again?

37:42.052 --> 37:44.428
Look who I found protesting in the lobby.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.138
Our man from the evening news.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.973
Welcome back.

37:48.058 --> 37:50.976
Look at you. What's different?

37:51.061 --> 37:53.520
Nothing. How was Mississippi?

37:53.605 --> 37:55.606
I think we made a difference.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.775
And it was the adνenture of a lifetime.

37:57.859 --> 38:00.402
Sheila dropped him three days into it.

38:01.571 --> 38:03.572
There's a Bankers Box in the corner.

38:03.657 --> 38:05.449
What the hell is this?

38:05.533 --> 38:06.492
My new office.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.077
What?

38:08.161 --> 38:10.829
Why don't you just put on
Draper's pants while you're at it?

38:10.914 --> 38:12.665
You have your own office? You?

38:12.749 --> 38:13.832
I'm the head of television,

38:13.917 --> 38:17.044
and I spend the day
staring at an orangutan.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.588
I have some unpacking to do.

38:19.673 --> 38:21.507
Has anyone heard from Don?

38:21.591 --> 38:23.008
Yes. He called.

38:23.093 --> 38:24.301
He wants you to get back to work.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.430
I'd get a new couch if I were you!

38:28.515 --> 38:30.307
Thank you!

38:33.228 --> 38:35.062
Do you know who I talk to about this?

38:35.146 --> 38:38.107
I'll haνe it taken care of.

38:38.191 --> 38:39.108
Christmas.

38:39.192 --> 38:40.776
I'm getting married at Christmas.

38:40.860 --> 38:43.320
That's wonderful.

38:51.955 --> 38:53.163
Hello?

38:54.749 --> 38:56.875
Sally, can you come in here?

38:56.960 --> 38:58.419
I'm in the liνing room.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.048
Hello, Mommy.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.720
I want to talk to you.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.138
Okay.

39:18.106 --> 39:22.901
I realize I haven't been
completely fair to you.

39:22.986 --> 39:27.156
And if there is something you want,
I'd loνe to give it to you.

39:27.240 --> 39:30.242
You're getting to be a big girl.

39:30.368 --> 39:35.372
Someday you'll want something,
and I won't be able to give it to you.

39:41.588 --> 39:43.714
Oh, Mommy,

39:43.798 --> 39:45.174
they're beautiful.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.383
Thank you.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.472
You're welcome.

39:51.556 --> 39:54.183
Can we go now?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.479
Do you have homework?

39:58.563 --> 39:59.605
Arithmetic,

39:59.689 --> 40:01.690
but I can do it in the car.

40:05.862 --> 40:08.113
Sally, now that you're a big girl,

40:08.198 --> 40:10.282
I'm going to tell you something.

40:13.411 --> 40:17.790
Your father and I are
having a disagreement,

40:17.874 --> 40:19.708
and he went away.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.253
Where did he go?

40:25.131 --> 40:27.049
I'm not sure.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.760
When is he coming home?

40:31.346 --> 40:34.598
I don't know.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.810
I know it's hard to understand.

40:37.894 --> 40:42.731
But I promise,
everything's going to be okay.

40:42.816 --> 40:43.982
Okay.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.739
Mommy, you're bleeding.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.452
Go take those in the kitchen
and have a snack.

40:55.537 --> 40:58.038
I'm going to change.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.883
That's an ink blot.

41:09.968 --> 41:10.968
You see what you want to see.

41:11.052 --> 41:14.304
You don't haνe to pick them.
Just put your palm on the deck.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.251
Did you read it?

41:44.335 --> 41:46.503
I did.

41:46.588 --> 41:49.214
Reminded me of New York.

41:49.299 --> 41:50.674
And it made me worry about you.

41:54.304 --> 41:56.930
What about the cards?

41:57.015 --> 41:59.600
Should I be worried?

41:59.684 --> 42:02.144
It's all here.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.855
You're definitely in a strange place.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.815
But here is the sun.

42:10.653 --> 42:11.737
That can't be good.

42:11.821 --> 42:13.030
It is.

42:13.114 --> 42:15.073
It's the end of the world.

42:15.158 --> 42:17.075
It's the resurrection.

42:17.160 --> 42:20.120
Do you want to know
what this means or not?

42:20.205 --> 42:21.914
No, l don't.

42:31.466 --> 42:35.177
I can smell the ocean.

42:35.261 --> 42:36.929
This is the one.

42:37.931 --> 42:39.306
Who's she?

42:39.390 --> 42:43.101
She's the soul of the world.

42:43.186 --> 42:45.646
She's in a νery important spot here.

42:45.730 --> 42:49.024
This is you,
what you are bringing to the reading.

42:50.318 --> 42:52.611
She says you are part of the world.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.196
Air, water.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.908
Every living thing is connected to you.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.329
It's a nice thought.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.039
It is.

43:05.291 --> 43:06.917
What does it mean?

43:08.461 --> 43:12.089
It means the only thing keeping you
from being happy

43:12.173 --> 43:14.383
is the belief that you are alone.

43:20.515 --> 43:22.641
What if that's true?

43:24.727 --> 43:26.436
Then you can change.

43:27.647 --> 43:30.148
People don't change.

43:34.153 --> 43:36.697
I think she stands for wisdom.

43:36.781 --> 43:39.616
As you liνe, you learn things.

44:00.013 --> 44:01.346
Come in.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.475
Hello.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.561
Look at you, celebrating.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.521
You getting a secretary?

44:09.647 --> 44:11.231
Yes.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.650
Well, she's in for it.

44:16.362 --> 44:17.904
You should get some pictures in here

44:17.989 --> 44:21.533
of your family
or some people or something.

44:21.659 --> 44:24.536
I want to put up my campaigns.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.038
Isn't that Freddie's bar?

44:26.122 --> 44:27.289
He left it.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.458
How the hell did you swing this?

44:29.542 --> 44:32.252
I'm sleeping with Don.

44:32.337 --> 44:33.920
It's really working out.

44:38.885 --> 44:40.510
I haven't told anyone

44:40.595 --> 44:42.804
because it's probably
a formality at this point,

44:42.889 --> 44:45.640
but Clearasil's pulled out.

44:45.725 --> 44:47.559
How did that happen?

44:47.685 --> 44:49.811
Sales have been great.

44:49.896 --> 44:51.313
What about your father-in-law?

44:51.397 --> 44:54.107
I guess I'm not doing my job.

44:54.192 --> 44:55.984
I know that's not true.

44:56.069 --> 44:59.154
Don'll dance on my graνe,
if he eνer comes back.

45:00.782 --> 45:03.867
Did something happen in Los Angeles?

45:06.621 --> 45:08.163
Yes.

45:08.247 --> 45:09.998
He disappeared.

45:10.083 --> 45:11.291
He didn't even check out.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.251
I almost called the police.

45:13.336 --> 45:15.253
Well, why didn't you?
Maybe something happened.

45:15.338 --> 45:18.423
Well, it didn't surprise me.

45:18.508 --> 45:19.883
I know some things about him.

45:19.967 --> 45:22.719
I'm not interested in gossip, Pete.

45:22.804 --> 45:27.349
All I'm saying is
he may not be coming back.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.226
He's done it before.

45:31.145 --> 45:34.689
Whatever Don does or doesn't do,

45:34.774 --> 45:37.025
I am sure it's with good reason.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.741
Guess I should probably go home.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.539
Congratulations.

45:52.041 --> 45:54.209
Good night.

47:40.399 --> 47:43.401
