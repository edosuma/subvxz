about that.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.782
I'm not here
to talk about that.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.284
I just want to hear
your side of the story.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.553
You don't want to hear--
I told y'all mother[bleep]

08:41.555 --> 08:43.221
We weren't gonna talk
about that, mort.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.656
I'm trying to talk
about the music.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.125
And lots of people understand
that you're talking

08:47.127 --> 08:49.160
About your own
personal experiences.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.563
Your fans
would like to know--

08:51.565 --> 08:52.631
How many times
I need--

08:52.633 --> 08:54.966
Why--what--
the fans don't want to know.

08:54.968 --> 08:55.800
That's--
you want to know!

08:55.802 --> 08:57.035
- I just want to clarify--
- you want to know.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.137
You ain't want to clari--
you want clarification?

08:59.139 --> 09:00.739
I want to hear your side
of the story.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.240
I'll tell you
my side of the story.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.842
Interview's over.
How about that?

09:03.844 --> 09:04.543
Interview's over.

09:04.545 --> 09:05.577
- Please, young bidness.
- Done.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.913
There's no need
for the interview to be over.

09:07.915 --> 09:08.914
Interview's over.

09:08.916 --> 09:09.781
All y'all
mother[bleep].

09:09.783 --> 09:12.651
Young bidness, there's no need
for the language or any of this.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.319
All y'all--
I told y'all mother[bleep]

09:14.321 --> 09:15.487
I wasn't gonna talk
about that.

09:15.489 --> 09:16.621
Do you want to talk
about the album?

09:16.623 --> 09:19.024
'cause I'd be more than happy
to talk about the album.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.091
- This is the<i> c-word.</i>
- Mort.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.193
It looks like it's well
on its way to going platinum.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.096
[bleep]--get the [bleep]
away from me, [bleep].

09:25.098 --> 09:27.632
Louis, louis.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.301
Well on its way
to going platinum.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.602
We can talk
about this.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.537
This [bleep]
is tucked in here.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.305
It's fine with me.

09:33.307 --> 09:34.639
You want to talk
about the album?

09:34.641 --> 09:35.774
We can talk
about the album.

09:35.776 --> 09:36.741
How about<i> tanks of truth?</i>

09:36.743 --> 09:38.910
<i>Tanks of truth--</i>
is that a treatise

09:38.912 --> 09:40.645
On the conflict
with isis?

09:40.647 --> 09:43.281
I mean, what--
talk to me about this.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.015
What--

09:44.017 --> 09:45.650
Young bidness, please,
I'm begging you.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.686
Just sit down,
take a deep breath,

09:47.688 --> 09:48.520
And let's discuss.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.322
- No.
- Let's discuss the album.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.991
It's done, mort.
It's done.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.395
So...

09:57.397 --> 09:58.563
You brought this
on yourself, mort.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.732
- Young bidness--
- you brought it on yourself.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.866
Young bidness,
young bidness,

10:01.868 --> 10:03.535
I would really love it
if you had a seat,

10:03.537 --> 10:04.769
And we could just
talk together

10:04.771 --> 10:06.438
About anything--
anything you want.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.341
We don't--I won't mention
tina's name again.

10:09.343 --> 10:10.442
Young bidness.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.410
How the [bleep]--

10:12.412 --> 10:13.478
Youthful--

10:13.480 --> 10:14.946
How does--
where does it go to?

10:14.948 --> 10:15.780
Louis, help him.

10:15.782 --> 10:19.250
No, get the [bleep]--
get the [bleep] off me, louis.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.785
Louis, go.

10:20.787 --> 10:21.419
Leave it be.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.787
You're exacerbating
the situation.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.723
(young bidness)
this [bleep]
attached to?

10:24.725 --> 10:26.725
- It's probably--
- it's just a lot of slack.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.927
The cord is blending in
with the color of the carpet.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.695
- So what--what--
- okay, I just think that--

10:30.697 --> 10:33.999
Young bidness, why don't
you drop the mic cable

10:34.001 --> 10:34.699
And have a seat?

10:34.701 --> 10:37.268
This is what we used to call
back in the army a fubar.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.970
Let me just--okay,
let me just tell you--

10:38.972 --> 10:41.139
No, get--
don't get involved.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.407
We have to get you
out of here.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.376
Amy, please,
can we just get--

10:44.378 --> 10:47.746
Listen--
here, if you let go of it...

10:47.748 --> 10:48.546
Let me get in there.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.081
Don't get in it.
Don't--see?

10:50.083 --> 10:51.249
I'm trying
to get around--

10:51.251 --> 10:53.652
Don't step
on my jacket!

10:53.654 --> 10:55.654
$1,500 jacket, bitch.

10:55.656 --> 10:56.221
Get--

10:56.223 --> 10:58.857
Why do we have black cords
and a black carpet?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.058
All right, well,
you mother[bleep]--

11:00.060 --> 11:05.296
I told y'all I wasn't gonna--
louis, I swear to [bleep] god!

11:05.298 --> 11:07.499
We're gonna
take care of it.

11:07.501 --> 11:08.833
Just stay put.

11:08.835 --> 11:09.434
Now you got--

11:09.436 --> 11:12.370
Now I seemed to have gotten
myself tangled in it.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.406
Don't--you ain't--

11:14.408 --> 11:16.374
Get off me, man.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.509
Now it's just me.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.443
Can I--may I help you?

11:18.445 --> 11:19.811
Don't touch the jacket.

11:19.813 --> 11:20.745
I'm sorry.

11:20.747 --> 11:21.546
Look, okay, here's--

11:21.548 --> 11:23.281
- Raise you knee.
- There's one end right here.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.251
- You got to get--now--
- hold on. I got bursitis.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.185
You know what?
Here.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.019
Here's what
we're gonna do.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.954
Have a seat here.
Put your fanny right here.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.923
- Don't say "fanny."
- there.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.091
- There you go.
- All right.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.127
How you--you do it--
what, you do this--

11:36.129 --> 11:36.661
Don't.

11:36.663 --> 11:37.796
You ain't taking
the pants off.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.397
Nicole, god damn it.
Where is jerry?

11:39.399 --> 11:41.132
This is some [bleep]
right here.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.268
Same sound guy
for 27 years,

11:43.270 --> 11:44.736
And he vanishes
into thin air.

11:44.738 --> 11:45.670
All right,
all right, no.

11:45.672 --> 11:46.838
Nicole,
for god's sake.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.808
All right,
louis, louis.

11:49.810 --> 11:50.442
Hold that.

11:50.444 --> 11:53.011
Don't do anything
but hold that.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.345
Okay, no, no.
You got to put--

11:54.347 --> 11:55.280
No, [bleep],
you got to take--

11:55.282 --> 11:57.649
No, you can't take
the pants off over the shoes!

11:57.651 --> 11:59.551
You can't take
the pants off over the shoes!

11:59.553 --> 12:01.352
Louis, louis,
get your white ass

12:01.354 --> 12:02.253
Out the mother[bleep].

12:02.255 --> 12:03.655
You ain't
helping nobody.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.924
- All right, all right.
- I'm taking the shoes off.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.727
Okay, left one first.
All right, well...

12:08.729 --> 12:11.563
Do whatever the [bleep]
you want, then, [bleep], fine.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.332
Thank you.
One, two...

12:14.334 --> 12:15.066
Thank you!

12:15.068 --> 12:18.470
I told y'all I wasn't
gonna talk about that [bleep]!

12:24.110 --> 12:27.011
We'll be right back
with alec baldwin.

I'm not like one
of those guys that's, like--

12:31.752 --> 12:33.985
Who wants a girl
to call him "daddy" or anything.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.653
I don't like...
[mumbling]

12:35.655 --> 12:37.388
- [shudders]
- uncle is fine.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.823
You know
what I mean?

12:38.825 --> 12:41.259
- Grandpa.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.169
That's weird.
That's strange to me.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.304
- That's strange to me.
- It's weird.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.339
That's strange
to me.

disappointed if I got her

13:14.661 --> 13:18.196
A ring that was diamonds
made to look like

13:18.198 --> 13:19.864
The<i> ghostbusters</i> symbol?

13:19.866 --> 13:22.367
Do not make me
stop this car,

13:22.369 --> 13:24.536
'cause I will stop this car
and strand you

13:24.538 --> 13:26.371
In the middle
of the mojave desert.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.539
I'm just asking
a question.

13:27.541 --> 13:28.540
That's the most--no.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.108
That's the most
ludicrous thing

13:30.110 --> 13:32.076
I've ever heard you
utter in my life.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.711
That's what I mean.
Well, I just--

13:33.713 --> 13:36.014
Is that a thought
that was in your mind?

13:36.016 --> 13:36.815
I'm thinking something--

13:36.817 --> 13:39.150
I mean, we both
have to look at it

Oh, jordan.

13:50.564 --> 13:52.397
Don't ever
do that again.
