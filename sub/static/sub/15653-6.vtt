00:09.907 --> 00:11.209
Can we pray?

00:12.309 --> 00:13.309
Excuse me?

00:15.413 --> 00:19.483
Please? It would make me
feel so much better.

00:19.516 --> 00:22.286
I'm sorry. It'd be unprofessional.

00:23.553 --> 00:25.056
But I want to pray.

00:26.123 --> 00:27.591
I want to pray.

00:27.625 --> 00:28.660
I want to pray!

00:28.692 --> 00:31.428
I... want... to...

00:31.462 --> 00:34.398
- pray!
- Orderly!

00:34.431 --> 00:36.968
- Orderly!

00:48.679 --> 00:50.648
Let us pray.

01:06.029 --> 01:08.499
I have seen into your soul, Terrence.

01:08.532 --> 01:11.302
Your bosses don't appreciate you.

01:11.335 --> 01:13.905
All your coworkers think you're a joke.

01:14.739 --> 01:17.142
But you have greatness in you.

01:17.174 --> 01:20.544
Now is your chance to show the world.

01:21.546 --> 01:24.650
Get it done.

01:27.719 --> 01:29.154
Thank you...

01:30.320 --> 01:32.356
...for opening my eyes.

I'm goin' back out.

04:45.693 --> 04:48.029
- Come on, let's go!

04:48.063 --> 04:50.353
In case you haven't noticed, maestro,

04:50.387 --> 04:53.135
there's a big orange ball
burning out there in the sky

04:53.168 --> 04:56.172
that turns the likes of us
into charcoal briquettes.

04:56.204 --> 04:57.707
Don't give me that shit.

04:57.740 --> 04:59.786
There's no breaks
until we find my brother.

04:59.819 --> 05:02.609
It's been three days... and nights.

05:02.641 --> 05:04.846
- We need rest.
- Fuck rest.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.216
- Who put you in charge, anyway?
- I did.

05:07.248 --> 05:10.185
Yeah? Well, tell your boss he's a prick.

05:10.219 --> 05:11.754
I got a break comin'.

05:20.596 --> 05:24.500
Sun just came up. Can't be 4:20 yet.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.852
It is somewhere.

05:27.885 --> 05:29.645
You know, I don't know
why you're holding out

05:29.669 --> 05:31.623
so much hope for your brother.

05:31.657 --> 05:34.659
That crazy queen has either
sucked his soul dry by now

05:34.693 --> 05:36.596
or made him one of her fuck boys.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.296
Either way, I guarantee you

05:38.330 --> 05:41.200
he is only a husk of his former self.

05:42.368 --> 05:44.003
Get out.

05:44.036 --> 05:47.006
You did not just do that.

05:47.039 --> 05:48.274
Oh.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.982
I'm terrified.

05:51.709 --> 05:55.693
Like your addled brain is gonna
remember any of this, anyway.

05:56.382 --> 05:58.222
You know, if you had
any kind of a memory left,

05:58.246 --> 06:00.716
we might be out there
winning this war right now.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.356
You know what I remember about the war?

06:05.591 --> 06:07.793
All the bad parts.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.796
And I guarantee you this
finely pressed suit of yours

06:10.829 --> 06:14.467
isn't ready for what
she is going to put you through.

06:21.707 --> 06:22.942
Yeah?

06:24.709 --> 06:26.012
Jesus Christ! Where are you?

06:26.044 --> 06:27.512
Nicotero State Hospital.

06:27.546 --> 06:29.447
It's abandoned, but she's using it.

06:29.481 --> 06:30.883
Using it for what?

06:30.916 --> 06:33.586
She's got me holed up in here.

06:33.618 --> 06:36.556
I can hear her.
I can hear her people, too.

06:37.989 --> 06:40.259
- I've gotta get back to my cell.
- What are you, nuts?

06:41.760 --> 06:43.695
No, Seth, I'm not nuts.

06:43.729 --> 06:46.464
Now, try and follow me here.
She doesn't know I'm out.

06:46.498 --> 06:48.901
She also doesn't know
that we know about this place.

06:48.933 --> 06:50.303
So round up the super friends,

06:50.335 --> 06:51.803
get out here and we'll ambush her.

06:51.837 --> 06:55.574
I think I'm in the central wing.

06:55.606 --> 06:57.309
- OK?
- Richard!

07:06.751 --> 07:07.753
[sighs]

07:10.988 --> 07:12.424
That sounds like a trap.

07:13.491 --> 07:15.560
Well, if it is, we'll be ready.

07:15.594 --> 07:17.063
And she'll be outnumbered.

07:17.096 --> 07:19.398
We wait for her to show,
then we grab her.

07:19.431 --> 07:22.702
Right. I suggest we get as many
bodies together as possible.

07:23.769 --> 07:25.505
This is mine.

07:37.515 --> 07:38.717
Gonzalez.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.455
Nicotero State Hospital?

07:43.488 --> 07:45.524
That place has been
shut down for a while.

07:45.556 --> 07:46.996
Which is probably why she's using it.

07:47.020 --> 07:49.923
OK, track down Ximena.
Tell her to meet us.

07:57.034 --> 07:58.604
They found Richie.

08:02.907 --> 08:04.409
I heard.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.593
Hey. Come here.

08:14.853 --> 08:16.622
We have time before we gotta go.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.957
Save it, vaquero.

08:18.991 --> 08:21.692
What? Too hot over here?

08:22.693 --> 08:25.931
Do you mind... turning around?

08:43.047 --> 08:44.482
You dropped this.

08:44.516 --> 08:46.017
Must've fallen off last night.

08:58.629 --> 09:00.032
Did you not wanna stay the night?

09:03.469 --> 09:04.703
I don't wanna be the one.

09:04.735 --> 09:06.538
The one to what?

09:10.642 --> 09:12.645
The one who keeps you
from going back to them.

09:15.814 --> 09:17.416
Come on, we gotta go.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.210
Didn't your daddy ever tell you

09:45.243 --> 09:47.113
not to run with scissors?

09:54.018 --> 09:56.788
- It doesn't look occupied.
- How do we wanna approach this?

09:58.089 --> 10:00.936
- Fan out.
- Fan out, really?

10:01.660 --> 10:05.030
If you find any entrance
that's not open, break in.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.532
Richard said he's in the central wing.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.085
Whoever's in there, we'll surround
them and work our way to him.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.870
Stone and swarm. I like it.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.739
You look, but you don't see.

10:17.843 --> 10:18.844
Tell me what you see.

10:34.959 --> 10:37.229
Your weapon of choice, isn't it?

10:49.641 --> 10:51.121
- [sadistic laughter]
- [impact grunt]

11:03.754 --> 11:05.991
[screams and groans]

11:09.728 --> 11:11.830
Remember what we shared, Richard.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.067
You know what you have to do.

11:16.701 --> 11:19.070
Send them all to a better place.

11:22.773 --> 11:24.976
[Seth] Richard!

11:25.009 --> 11:27.112
Richard!

11:31.916 --> 11:33.552
Holy shit.

11:35.152 --> 11:36.821
Are you OK?

11:36.854 --> 11:38.157
Yeah.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.790
I guess I didn't make it
back to my cell.

11:42.227 --> 11:44.063
Son of a bitch.

11:44.476 --> 11:46.130
I was worried sick about you.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.032
- You sure you're OK?
- Yeah.

11:48.065 --> 11:49.228
Yeah?

11:50.134 --> 11:53.806
All right. Let's get
the hell out of here. Come on.

12:04.715 --> 12:06.985
[Amaru] <i>You know what you have to do.</i>

12:07.018 --> 12:09.187
[Richard sighs]

12:09.220 --> 12:11.791
<i>Send them all to a better place.</i>

12:18.030 --> 12:20.799
He swears that she was here
and she's coming back.

12:20.831 --> 12:22.667
Power's on in the whole place.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.670
And it does look like
he's been in that cell

12:24.703 --> 12:26.805
for at least three days.

12:26.838 --> 12:28.272
[Tanner] Yeah, but...

12:29.395 --> 12:31.744
can't take everything
he says at face value.

12:31.777 --> 12:33.112
Meaning?

12:33.144 --> 12:35.113
Meaning your bro's always been

12:35.147 --> 12:38.083
a couple tacos
short of a fiesta platter.

12:38.115 --> 12:41.152
The light's on in his fridge,
but the food ain't cold.

12:41.185 --> 12:43.721
And you're the paragon
of sanity, you sick fuck.

12:43.754 --> 12:46.357
Gentlemen!
She's clearly holding him here.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.892
So there's a very good chance

12:47.926 --> 12:49.846
she or one of her slaves
will make an appearance.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.664
Let's make one more sweep.

12:51.696 --> 12:54.376
At the very least, someone could
show and we track them back to her.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.068
OK. Works for me.

12:56.100 --> 12:59.871
Hey, gotta get rid of the cars.

13:07.012 --> 13:09.314
They'll see 'em when they come back.

13:09.347 --> 13:11.817
Somebody should stay
in the control room, too.

13:11.849 --> 13:13.152
It's right up front.

13:13.185 --> 13:15.404
You can sound the alarm from here.

13:15.437 --> 13:16.921
Alert us to any intruders.

13:17.371 --> 13:18.456
OK.

13:18.489 --> 13:21.893
You two. Professor long hair,
Jimi Hendrix...

13:23.027 --> 13:24.729
go move the cars out back, pronto.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.455
[Richard] I'll go with the professor.

13:27.364 --> 13:29.301
Don't want him scratching up
our ride again.

13:29.334 --> 13:31.936
Scratching up your...
that was... Look...

13:31.969 --> 13:34.038
- I was a little tipsy...
- OK. Hey!

13:34.071 --> 13:35.206
Make it quick. Go!

13:36.508 --> 13:38.243
I'm gonna stay and guard here, OK?

13:38.276 --> 13:39.712
One sweep and we're done.

13:39.744 --> 13:41.147
Let's go.

13:49.754 --> 13:54.325
Whoa! Put your glasses on,
four eyes! Idiot.

13:55.359 --> 13:57.363
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

14:17.516 --> 14:20.051
[Tanner groans]

14:22.153 --> 14:24.255
How could you hit me there...

14:24.776 --> 14:26.458
of all places?

14:26.490 --> 14:28.159
Oh, Jesus.

14:29.161 --> 14:32.030
You sick son of a... [groans]

14:32.062 --> 14:34.332
What the hell are you doing?

14:34.365 --> 14:36.300
Oh, you sick fuck.

14:36.334 --> 14:41.774
[groans]

14:43.008 --> 14:44.777
Hey!

14:45.576 --> 14:47.178
[groans]

14:47.211 --> 14:49.314
Next one will kill you.

Somebody open the door!

[telephone rings]

15:56.348 --> 15:57.960
Hello, brother.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.954
In case you're wondering,
I've initiated a lockdown.

16:02.377 --> 16:03.396
Richard...

16:03.421 --> 16:05.190
<i>Can't let the lunatics turn this place</i>

16:05.223 --> 16:07.291
into <i>Shock Corridor.</i>

16:07.325 --> 16:09.194
You may be in the control room, brother,

16:09.227 --> 16:11.530
but I've got my hand on the wheel now.

16:11.562 --> 16:12.897
<i>Richard, listen to me.</i>

16:12.931 --> 16:15.166
Let me outta here right now.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.235
- You understand me?
- No!

16:17.268 --> 16:19.470
Richard, let me the fuck
outta here right now!

16:19.503 --> 16:22.841
No. OK, just... stay there.

16:23.642 --> 16:25.176
Do not attempt to leave.

16:25.209 --> 16:26.911
Let me outta here right now!

16:28.012 --> 16:29.614
I've got a plan, Stan.

16:31.148 --> 16:33.051
I've got a plan.

16:33.084 --> 16:34.520
Dammit!

16:36.756 --> 16:39.893
[jiggling door handle]

16:39.926 --> 16:42.362
[frustrated sigh]

16:42.395 --> 16:43.665
She left me, you know.

16:44.665 --> 16:45.833
What's that?

16:45.866 --> 16:48.569
My ex-wife. She left me.

16:50.737 --> 16:53.710
You said you didn't wanna be the one
that comes between me and my family.

16:54.607 --> 16:56.611
I really didn't have a choice.

16:58.258 --> 16:59.593
I understand.

17:01.848 --> 17:03.384
Do you?

17:06.223 --> 17:08.761
We made a choice,
for you to spend the night.

17:11.534 --> 17:12.637
It's a two-way street.

17:13.894 --> 17:16.396
That's generally how it works, vaquero.

17:18.432 --> 17:21.076
- Smells like shit.
- We're in a morgue.

17:21.109 --> 17:23.703
No, smells like actual feces.

17:23.736 --> 17:25.872
[pounding]

17:30.778 --> 17:32.847
Back the fuck up, man.

17:32.879 --> 17:34.848
I will go full Dahmer
on both your asses.

17:34.882 --> 17:36.689
No one will ever find the pieces.

17:36.721 --> 17:39.020
All right. We don't wanna hurt you.

17:39.052 --> 17:41.521
[combat grunts]

17:41.555 --> 17:43.250
OK, that kinda hurt.

17:43.824 --> 17:45.493
[cocks pistol]

17:45.526 --> 17:48.058
[muffled gunshots]

17:49.997 --> 17:51.566
[inaudible] Shit.

18:01.607 --> 18:03.310
[switch clacking]

18:07.947 --> 18:09.516
[sighs]

18:09.549 --> 18:11.051
Shit.

18:27.800 --> 18:28.802
Yes.

18:29.869 --> 18:30.871
Hello?

18:32.405 --> 18:33.741
Can anybody hear me?

18:35.576 --> 18:37.111
Did you lock us in here?

18:37.697 --> 18:39.080
I should've,

18:39.113 --> 18:41.849
but you agents are
hard to keep in a cage.

18:41.882 --> 18:43.818
- Agents?
- CIA.

18:43.850 --> 18:46.020
That's what you guys are. I can tell.

18:46.052 --> 18:48.655
Special activities division,
black bag operations,

18:48.688 --> 18:50.523
wet work, whatever the fuck.

18:50.557 --> 18:51.834
What do you think,
he's some kind of squatter?

18:51.858 --> 18:52.992
Oh, you gonna talk about me

18:53.026 --> 18:54.128
like I'm not even here?

18:54.161 --> 18:55.496
That's not very good tradecraft.

18:55.529 --> 18:57.365
Stop. Someone's been in here,

18:57.397 --> 18:59.277
and they've been using
this place like a prison.

18:59.301 --> 19:00.867
<i>Like</i> a prison.

19:00.901 --> 19:02.837
I hear them sometimes.

19:02.869 --> 19:05.439
Guess what? They can't track me anymore.

19:08.442 --> 19:10.644
I removed the transmitter myself.

19:10.676 --> 19:12.413
I'm a cable installer by trade.

19:12.445 --> 19:13.847
[speaking Spanish]

19:17.917 --> 19:21.655
Losing the transmitter. That's smart.

19:21.687 --> 19:23.690
Was that before or after the massacre?

19:26.938 --> 19:28.341
Massacre?

19:28.373 --> 19:30.511
That security guard shot up the place.

19:31.377 --> 19:32.379
Were you here for that?

19:33.513 --> 19:35.448
Terrence was good man. He...

19:35.480 --> 19:37.583
just went off one day.

19:37.617 --> 19:38.784
Man.

19:39.785 --> 19:41.388
Got a name?

19:41.967 --> 19:44.423
Pablo. As in Escobar.

19:44.457 --> 19:46.760
So don't fuck with me.

19:51.063 --> 19:52.765
What are you doing in here?

19:52.799 --> 19:56.536
They discharged me.
Told me I can handle the world.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.274
Yeah, but that's not
your world out there.

20:04.343 --> 20:05.344
This is.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.009
I bet you know this place
like the back of your hand.

20:12.784 --> 20:14.321
[sighs]

20:15.755 --> 20:17.690
But you probably
can't get us out of here.

20:17.724 --> 20:19.793
Who does he think he's talking to?

20:28.735 --> 20:29.736
You first.

20:30.803 --> 20:32.405
So, is it true?

20:32.438 --> 20:34.674
You fought all those Xibalban things?

20:34.707 --> 20:36.709
And you fought her, Amaru?

20:36.743 --> 20:38.477
That's why you joined us, right?

20:38.511 --> 20:39.711
'Cause you're that grizzled vet

20:39.743 --> 20:41.143
that's gonna help me find my sister.

20:41.167 --> 20:42.549
Look, kid. I am a soloist.

20:42.582 --> 20:44.684
I am not a member of this boy band.

20:44.717 --> 20:46.315
- <i>Capisce?</i>
- Yeah, I get that.

20:46.347 --> 20:49.688
But, you know, I was hoping you could
show me the ropes, because I'm new

20:49.721 --> 20:51.857
and you're... old.

20:51.890 --> 20:53.692
How about you go that way,

20:53.726 --> 20:55.728
and see if there's another exit.

20:55.762 --> 20:57.364
Go ahead. Yeah.

20:57.397 --> 20:59.399
And... get the fuck outta my face.

21:00.699 --> 21:02.101
Hello?

21:03.101 --> 21:05.071
Can anybody hear me?

21:05.103 --> 21:06.972
<i>Hello?</i>

21:07.005 --> 21:08.608
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

21:09.609 --> 21:11.011
<i>Anybody?</i>

21:12.544 --> 21:14.348
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

21:15.415 --> 21:17.450
- Yeah, it's me.
- Burt?

21:17.483 --> 21:19.619
Oh, Jesus Christ, man.
Something's wrong with Richie.

21:19.651 --> 21:21.888
Really? No shit.

21:22.851 --> 21:25.592
Just get back to the control room.
Get me outta here.

21:25.624 --> 21:27.993
There you go, giving orders again.

21:28.026 --> 21:30.396
<i>Burt, now is not the fucking time!</i>

21:36.768 --> 21:39.538
<i>It's just common courtesy. Ask politely.</i>

21:39.572 --> 21:42.141
Burt, just shut the fuck up.
Tell me where you are right now.

21:42.604 --> 21:44.010
Well, I don't know.

21:44.043 --> 21:47.112
Um, I saw something about the east wing.

21:47.146 --> 21:48.682
Shit. You're about to have company.

21:49.948 --> 21:52.518
Really? OK.

22:39.564 --> 22:40.790
Burt?

22:41.566 --> 22:43.169
Is that you?

23:00.820 --> 23:04.157
- What the hell, man?
- Shh! I think I saw her.

23:05.257 --> 23:06.793
This way, through the kitchen.

23:06.825 --> 23:09.562
- No, let's go find Burt.
- There's no time.

23:09.594 --> 23:10.663
Come on.

23:21.940 --> 23:24.110
Yeah, the guy was
kind of a dick, anyways.

23:24.142 --> 23:25.678
Yeah.

23:27.246 --> 23:30.149
He's about to lose
the Second Xibalban War.

23:31.249 --> 23:33.786

Oh, boy...

24:47.793 --> 24:49.295
[both audibly straining]

24:51.063 --> 24:52.666
Yeah, sorry, pal.

24:55.101 --> 24:56.902
[Burt screams]

24:56.936 --> 24:59.939
Fuck! Goddamn it!

25:08.080 --> 25:11.149
[Seth] <i>Burt. Burt, did
you make it over there?</i>

25:11.182 --> 25:12.785
Talk to me, Burt.

25:13.785 --> 25:15.354
<i>Burt?</i>

25:26.998 --> 25:28.166
Richard,

25:28.199 --> 25:30.937
<i>listen to me if you can hear me.</i>

25:30.969 --> 25:33.338
<i>Remember what Uncle Eddie
said about jobs that go bad.</i>

25:33.371 --> 25:34.974
<i>"Adjust if you must,</i>

25:35.006 --> 25:37.342
but you stick to the plan, Stan."

25:37.376 --> 25:40.113
This is not the plan. You know that.

25:42.014 --> 25:43.183
Richard?

25:44.883 --> 25:46.885
[sighs] Shit.

25:51.791 --> 25:54.127
[audibly straining]

25:59.398 --> 26:02.267
[ceiling access door opens]

26:05.170 --> 26:06.171
[Ximena] Yeah.

26:12.977 --> 26:14.413
What happened to you?

26:14.447 --> 26:17.350
That four-eyed motherfucker...

26:17.382 --> 26:19.284
cut me with that Xibalban knife of his.

26:19.317 --> 26:22.821
Oh... I want his egghead on a stick.
Who's that?

26:22.854 --> 26:25.257
I'm Pablo. As in Escobar.

26:25.291 --> 26:27.460
He's helping us.

26:27.493 --> 26:30.129
You know, that was nice, the way
he helped you down like that.

26:30.161 --> 26:32.731
I haven't seen you
blush like that since...

26:32.765 --> 26:34.367
I dunno, the 18th century?

26:34.399 --> 26:37.169
<i>Ay por Dios.</i> Just tell us what you saw.

26:37.203 --> 26:42.108
Blood red eyes, Xibalban dialect.
She got to Richie.

26:42.140 --> 26:45.210
- She got to him how?
- She awakened his shadow self.

26:49.281 --> 26:52.919
- Where are you going?
-I gotta get to this goddamn intercom.

26:52.951 --> 26:54.820
Awakened his what?

26:54.853 --> 26:57.890
We all have another self
that exists on that side.

26:57.922 --> 27:00.044
Some of us struggle with it every day.

27:01.127 --> 27:03.730
Richard's has taken hold of him,
and it's loyal to her.

27:04.996 --> 27:07.366
She's using him to tear us apart.

27:09.034 --> 27:10.394
What the hell is she talking about?

27:10.418 --> 27:12.788
Don't worry about it. You'll be fine.

27:16.342 --> 27:19.746
Sorry, kid. I ain't gonna
heal if I don't feed.

27:19.778 --> 27:22.448
What the fuck?!

27:22.480 --> 27:24.449
You idiot!

27:24.483 --> 27:27.220
He was our only shot
at cancelling the lockdown.

27:27.253 --> 27:29.121
- I'll get him.
- No!

27:29.155 --> 27:32.825
You stay here with numbnuts.
I'll go get him.

27:32.858 --> 27:34.094
Isn't she a joy?

27:54.380 --> 27:55.814
OK.

28:02.487 --> 28:04.457
[ceiling access door opens]

28:04.489 --> 28:06.024
[Pablo groans softly]

28:06.057 --> 28:07.059
[Seth] Hey.

28:08.393 --> 28:10.228
Hey! Open the door.

28:10.262 --> 28:12.365
- You one of them too?
- One of what?

28:12.398 --> 28:16.068
Sharp teeth, crazy eyes, genetically
engineered super mutants.

28:16.101 --> 28:17.837
Look at my face.

28:17.870 --> 28:21.040
No, I'm not. I can help you.

28:21.073 --> 28:23.393
All right? Just-just open the door.
Help me get outta here.

28:24.104 --> 28:25.578
I gotta rewire this panel.

28:25.611 --> 28:28.113
It's, like, doing a co-ax
reroute to the living room.

28:28.147 --> 28:29.982
I got nothing to strip the cables with.

28:30.015 --> 28:33.352
OK, look, just... just try, all right?
Just give it a shot.

28:40.124 --> 28:41.393
[exhales]

28:49.235 --> 28:50.468
Hey. Hey!

28:50.502 --> 28:52.839
- What? I'm working on it.
- Hey...

28:52.871 --> 28:54.541
[low bestial growl]

29:18.030 --> 29:19.265
Richard.

29:23.334 --> 29:25.219
Told you to stay put.

29:25.905 --> 29:29.542
"Adjust if you must,
but stick to the plan, Stan."

[clanking inside ceiling]

29:59.847 --> 30:01.049
Pablo?

30:02.950 --> 30:04.619
Is that you?

30:11.392 --> 30:12.559
Pablo?

30:16.505 --> 30:17.674
Pablo?

30:27.007 --> 30:29.644
[rhythmic squeaking sound]

[drill whirrs]

30:41.721 --> 30:42.789
[Ximena grunts]

30:45.273 --> 30:47.709
When a doctor performs a
lobotomy, he puts you to sleep

30:47.742 --> 30:51.246
and then drills a hole into your
head, straight through your skull.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.549
Lucky for you, I won't be
putting you to sleep.

30:53.581 --> 30:54.649

31:13.735 --> 31:15.338
Finish her.

31:24.746 --> 31:25.914
[Ximena groans]

31:36.759 --> 31:38.594
That's far enough.
There's nothing there.

31:38.627 --> 31:41.328
You wanna double back, boss?
We'll double back.

31:41.363 --> 31:43.666
- You can reunite with your girl.
- She's not my girl.

31:43.698 --> 31:46.534
So what is it?
Is it the forbidden fruit thing?

31:46.568 --> 31:48.871
Where she's the culebra and you're not?

31:48.904 --> 31:51.339
I don't really wanna
talk about this right now.

31:51.373 --> 31:54.213
Come on, Peacekeeper, you pull out
your little six-gun on a lowly snake,

31:54.237 --> 31:55.444
there must be a reason.

31:55.476 --> 31:56.678
She might be a snake...

31:59.172 --> 32:01.441
but she's the most human person I know.

32:01.617 --> 32:03.986
Aw, cute.

32:12.895 --> 32:14.430
[Freddie] She was a patient here.

32:16.065 --> 32:18.434
She probably made
that guard go ballistic.

32:18.466 --> 32:20.402
Same thing she's done to Richie.

32:21.837 --> 32:23.472
You're the expert here.

32:23.504 --> 32:26.312
How do we fix this? Can we reverse it?

32:26.742 --> 32:29.073
Back in the day, way back in the day,

32:29.098 --> 32:34.260
the <i>curanderos</i> had a purification
ritual to lift Xibalban possession.

32:34.285 --> 32:37.689
They would cover the person
with resin and set 'em on fire.

32:37.852 --> 32:40.922
Something like that
might work with Mr. Gecko,

32:40.955 --> 32:44.726
especially with his culebra
healing ability, you know?

32:44.760 --> 32:45.973
And if it doesn't...

32:48.800 --> 32:50.236
we kill him.

32:53.735 --> 32:56.004
[Ximena] <i>Amaru's taken control of you!</i>

32:57.106 --> 32:58.973
You have to pull yourself away.

32:59.007 --> 33:01.110
And we all have to stop her.

33:01.143 --> 33:05.448
Richard. Richard, you know this.

33:07.014 --> 33:08.550
Richard!

33:13.155 --> 33:14.824
[Scott] Let me outta here, asshole!

33:14.857 --> 33:16.559
[Tanner] Let me outta here!

33:16.591 --> 33:17.992
- What are you doing?
- Richie!

33:18.025 --> 33:20.962
Nobody tries to cut me
in half with a car

33:20.995 --> 33:23.064
and lives to talk about it!

33:23.098 --> 33:26.735
All right? Now you come here
and open this door.

33:26.769 --> 33:28.938
[Scott] ...fuckin' kill you!

33:28.971 --> 33:30.506
What are you doing?

33:31.973 --> 33:34.377
You're supposed to send them
to a better place.

33:34.409 --> 33:36.511
I thought of another way.

33:36.544 --> 33:39.184
I can still get to Xibalba, but I
need to bring my brother with me.

33:39.208 --> 33:41.617
It's the only way I'll go.

33:41.649 --> 33:43.118
Trust me,

33:43.673 --> 33:45.755
Seth is the key.

33:45.788 --> 33:48.022
I think you'll like what I have planned.

33:48.056 --> 33:51.727
No! You don't get to think,
you do as I say!

33:51.760 --> 33:54.931
And what I say is you kill them
all, and start with the girl.

33:56.098 --> 33:57.832
She and her so-called lord

33:57.866 --> 34:01.037
committed the biggest
betrayal of them all.

34:42.678 --> 34:45.580
I'm gonna go down that way, see
if I can catch up with her.

34:45.612 --> 34:47.581
You circle around to the west side.

34:47.614 --> 34:48.617
Good idea.

35:03.164 --> 35:06.034
Ahh! What the fuck!

35:08.002 --> 35:12.040
[current sizzles]

35:18.046 --> 35:19.548
[exertion grunt]

35:19.580 --> 35:21.517
What the fuck are you doing?

35:24.185 --> 35:25.702
The fuck is this?

35:26.254 --> 35:29.791
Xibalban sumbitch!
I know that's not you in there!

35:31.660 --> 35:34.129
Piece of crap Xibalban beetlehead.

35:36.198 --> 35:37.500
[pistol cocks]

35:37.533 --> 35:38.868
Game over.

35:46.908 --> 35:49.044
[Tanner] All right, Seth. My man.

35:49.077 --> 35:50.178
Yeah.

35:52.914 --> 35:55.087
You're going off the rails, Richard.

35:55.917 --> 35:57.151
I'm gonna bring you back.

35:57.185 --> 35:58.254
[gunshot]

35:58.287 --> 35:59.655
[combat grunts]

36:00.789 --> 36:02.191
[Richard groans]

36:03.191 --> 36:05.160
[Seth groans]

36:09.263 --> 36:12.600
I'm not gonna let you kill them.
It's not gonna happen.

36:12.633 --> 36:14.035
I'm not gonna kill them, Seth.

36:16.071 --> 36:17.106
You are.

36:21.556 --> 36:22.891
[Seth grunts]

36:27.295 --> 36:28.797
Richard, come on, man.

36:28.831 --> 36:30.766
[Amaru] Two Geckos are
better than one, no?

36:30.798 --> 36:33.369
Yes, that is true.

37:00.862 --> 37:02.664
Richard, come on, man.

37:03.865 --> 37:05.735
She's fucking with you.

37:05.768 --> 37:09.704
Amaru told me the truth
about this world. And the next.

37:09.737 --> 37:12.741
There is a place
for people like us, Seth.

37:16.577 --> 37:18.014
I've seen it.

37:28.023 --> 37:29.559
Let me show you.

37:33.362 --> 37:35.898
[groaning softly]

37:35.931 --> 37:38.601
[soft laughter]

37:44.606 --> 37:47.510
[euphoric sigh]

37:47.543 --> 37:50.214
[sighs] I saw it, Seth.

37:51.079 --> 37:53.368
Xibalba is a place where we can shine.

37:53.782 --> 37:55.222
Where we can finally live like kings.

37:55.246 --> 37:56.619
What are you talking about?

37:56.652 --> 37:58.332
It's a place where
you can live a long life

37:58.356 --> 37:59.521
and die on a beach.

37:59.955 --> 38:02.023
You're not making any sense.

38:02.056 --> 38:05.063
Richard. Richard, look at me.

38:05.972 --> 38:08.167
Xibalba is not El Rey.

38:09.031 --> 38:12.568
It's hell. You remember that?

38:12.601 --> 38:16.037
You said hell was coming for us
for the things that we've done.

38:16.070 --> 38:18.150
What if the things that we've
done were for a reason?

38:18.174 --> 38:20.442
Richard, we have to be
careful here, all right?

38:20.476 --> 38:22.778
Amaru gave me
a one-way ticket to Xibalba,

38:22.811 --> 38:23.778
but I am not going without you.

38:23.811 --> 38:24.913
We are not going anywhere.

38:24.947 --> 38:26.916
She is opening up the gates for us...

38:26.949 --> 38:28.684
Would you fucking listen to me!

38:30.652 --> 38:31.887
Buddy...

38:32.887 --> 38:34.631
we've been down this road before.

38:35.157 --> 38:36.492
Yeah?

38:37.793 --> 38:40.496
Come on, buddy.
You can come back from this.

38:42.097 --> 38:43.559
This isn't you.

38:45.467 --> 38:47.003
This is not you.

38:49.046 --> 38:51.074
We have each other's back.

38:52.874 --> 38:54.287
That's what we do.

38:56.010 --> 38:58.780
I look out for you, you look out for me.

39:03.519 --> 39:05.088
This is not you.

39:09.490 --> 39:10.592
It's not me.

39:12.161 --> 39:13.863
It's us.

39:23.838 --> 39:24.998
Do you remember when Pop died?

39:25.022 --> 39:26.575
Yeah, the day you lit him on fire.

39:26.608 --> 39:27.968
No! The day that we buried him, OK?

39:27.992 --> 39:29.744
We got our first black suits that day.

39:29.777 --> 39:31.546
Do you remember
what everybody said to us?

39:31.579 --> 39:32.847
No, Richard.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.884
They said that he was
going to a better place.

39:34.916 --> 39:36.851
Now why do you think it is
that they say that?

39:36.885 --> 39:39.188
It's a fucking fairytale! All right?

39:39.220 --> 39:42.023
It's bullshit people tell themselves
so they can sleep at night.

39:42.056 --> 39:43.759
No. They say it because it's true.

39:43.791 --> 39:46.027
Death is not the end,
just the beginning.

39:46.061 --> 39:47.595
[audibly struggling]

39:47.628 --> 39:50.165
Kill them all one by one, and we're in.

39:50.199 --> 39:51.666
Do your part, brother.

39:58.005 --> 40:01.042
No. We are not killers.

40:01.076 --> 40:03.512
We pull down scores, and that is it.

40:03.545 --> 40:04.729
Do it!

40:07.782 --> 40:09.985
- [Ximena gasping]
- Do it! Do it!

40:10.018 --> 40:11.586
- ...kill her!
- Do it!

40:11.619 --> 40:14.757
Do it... and your
brother's six feet under.

40:18.141 --> 40:19.776
Take the shot and she dies.

40:19.808 --> 40:22.611
- Richie's possessed.
- Don't listen to him, Seth.

40:22.645 --> 40:24.413
Burt says he needs to be purified.

40:24.446 --> 40:26.515
Gotta set him on fire
if you wanna get him back.

40:26.549 --> 40:27.805
That's gonna ruin the plan, Stan.

40:27.838 --> 40:30.759
No, listen to Freddie!
Your brother's gone!

40:31.687 --> 40:33.456
[Richard groans]

40:37.649 --> 40:38.785
How could you do this?

40:39.094 --> 40:41.031
This was all for you, Seth. All of it.

40:42.799 --> 40:44.335
[growls]

40:48.471 --> 40:50.407
[cries out]

40:50.440 --> 40:53.476
Ah, fuck, you fucking prick!

40:53.509 --> 40:55.578
I'm your blood! I saved your life!

40:56.578 --> 41:00.015
[speaking Xibalban language]

41:00.049 --> 41:02.052
All hail Amaru.

41:02.085 --> 41:05.054
[Amaru] <i>Richard... Richard...
Richard... Richard...</i>

41:05.087 --> 41:06.790
[Richard] All hail Amaru!

41:08.158 --> 41:11.395
[Amaru] <i>Get it done.</i>

41:19.701 --> 41:21.437
Sorry, man.

41:21.471 --> 41:23.107
[Richie screams]

41:25.875 --> 41:28.078
Kill her. Kill her now.

41:36.652 --> 41:39.156
[audibly struggling]

41:45.127 --> 41:46.595
[grunts]

41:46.629 --> 41:48.699
Freddie. Freddie,
I'm not gonna fight you.

41:49.298 --> 41:50.333
I'm not gonna fight you.

41:53.025 --> 41:55.461
You let me down for the last time, Seth.

42:03.746 --> 42:06.583
[combat grunts]

42:11.287 --> 42:13.490
Freddie. Freddie, <i>por favor.</i>

42:13.857 --> 42:14.958
Stop, stop, stop.

42:17.801 --> 42:19.604
Come and say goodbye to your brother!

42:40.897 --> 42:42.332
[snarling]

42:43.799 --> 42:45.135
[angry grunt]

42:46.636 --> 42:49.640
[groaning]

42:54.710 --> 42:55.913
[grunts] Freddie...

42:55.946 --> 42:57.848
hell is coming.

42:57.881 --> 43:01.752
OK? But it doesn't
have to change who you are.

43:01.785 --> 43:04.555
There's dark and there's light.

43:04.587 --> 43:06.390
And you are light.

43:06.422 --> 43:08.359
Yeah. OK?

43:08.392 --> 43:10.230
That's what I love about you.

43:14.297 --> 43:15.299
You hear me?

43:17.433 --> 43:19.202
You did.

43:32.950 --> 43:34.152
No!

43:41.558 --> 43:45.363
[screaming]

44:14.357 --> 44:16.526
[cremains sizzle]

44:44.520 --> 44:45.989
[buzzer sounds]

44:46.022 --> 44:47.725
