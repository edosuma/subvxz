03:10.431 --> 03:11.773
<i>on the screen,</i>

<i>this is the Money Pit data set.</i>

03:17.688 --> 03:19.281
<i>The orange is kind of
in the middle.</i>

03:19.365 --> 03:22.201

03:22.360 --> 03:26.029
<i>This linear feature here,
it almost, to me,</i>

03:26.113 --> 03:28.498
<i>what this might be
is some sort of a tunnel.</i>

03:30.952 --> 03:32.035

<i>And it extends
all the way over to here.</i>

03:35.289 --> 03:36.215
Where's C-1, for reference?

03:37.208 --> 03:39.468
<i>- C-1's right there.</i>
- Okay.

03:39.627 --> 03:41.053

03:41.212 --> 03:43.046
<i>is actually, go back to
the bird's-eye view.</i>

03:43.130 --> 03:45.966

this point is right in</i>

03:46.050 --> 03:47.893
<i>the middle of Shaft 12.</i>

03:49.312 --> 03:51.813
- Interesting.
- It puts us right in our zone of interest for sure.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.473
Yeah.

03:53.557 --> 03:55.725
<i>NARRATOR:
In 1894,</i>

03:55.810 --> 03:57.394
<i>treasure hunter Frederick Blair</i>

03:57.487 --> 03:59.988
<i>and his team
constructed Shaft 12,</i>

04:00.147 --> 04:02.148
<i>30 feet east of the Money Pit,</i>

04:02.242 --> 04:05.160
<i>down to a depth of 55 feet.</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:08.747
<i>His plan was to intercept
the legendary booby-trapped</i>

04:08.906 --> 04:12.167
<i>flood tunnel believed
to originate at Smith's Cove.</i>

04:12.326 --> 04:14.670
<i>Unfortunately,
the effort failed,</i>

04:14.754 --> 04:17.747
<i>and Shaft 12 was abandoned.</i>

04:17.832 --> 04:21.093
Can you give us some
depths on this anomaly?

04:21.252 --> 04:22.928
Just a little bit
north of 100 feet

04:23.087 --> 04:23.929
<i>of depth.</i>

04:24.088 --> 04:25.180
<i>So, uh,</i>

04:25.339 --> 04:26.506
let's go take a look inside.

04:26.590 --> 04:29.685
<i>So if we go right in...</i>

04:31.854 --> 04:35.023
<i>You have
this tunnel-type system,</i>

04:35.182 --> 04:37.109
<i>so that tells me right away that</i>

04:37.268 --> 04:40.362
<i>it has to be from some
sort of human activity,</i>

04:40.521 --> 04:44.199
<i>- roughly around depths that you guys are expecting.</i>
- Yeah.

04:45.693 --> 04:48.778
<i>NARRATOR: Is it possible
that in his failed bid to</i>

04:48.863 --> 04:51.698
<i>locate a booby trap,
Frederick Blair was actually</i>

04:51.791 --> 04:55.544
<i>on a course to intercept
a much deeper man-made tunnel?</i>

04:55.628 --> 04:58.213
<i>And one in an area where
the team has recently detected</i>

04:58.298 --> 05:02.459
<i>both gold and silver
through water sample testing?</i>

05:02.543 --> 05:04.878
One of the more interesting
knowns in the Money Pit

05:04.962 --> 05:07.297
is Shaft 12.

05:07.381 --> 05:08.807
<i>It was work
conducted very early on</i>

05:08.966 --> 05:11.560
<i>when the Money Pit location
was known.</i>

05:11.644 --> 05:14.888
<i>I think we need to
prove or disprove, ground truth,</i>

05:14.972 --> 05:18.150
<i>whether or not there really
is a tunnel below Shaft 12.</i>

05:18.309 --> 05:19.735
<i>That's impactful.</i>

05:19.819 --> 05:21.811
All right.
Should we go deeper?

05:21.896 --> 05:24.156
- Yes.
- Yes.

05:24.315 --> 05:25.324
Here we go.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.068
<i>I think this
is the most significant</i>

05:28.152 --> 05:30.495
<i>anomaly out of everything.</i>

05:30.580 --> 05:32.581
<i>And it's a larger
anomaly, but then there</i>

05:32.740 --> 05:34.324
<i>are smaller details in it.</i>

05:34.417 --> 05:37.502
<i>And this is down
at about 160 feet.</i>

05:37.587 --> 05:39.838
<i>What's really interesting
about this, though,</i>

05:39.922 --> 05:43.842
<i>is this low-density,
cave-like feature right here.</i>

05:44.001 --> 05:47.596
<i>I call it the Structure.
Very square,</i>

05:47.755 --> 05:50.265
<i>with this little tail off of it.</i>

05:50.424 --> 05:52.759
<i>Let me zoom out here for you.</i>

05:52.852 --> 05:55.678
<i>And what kind of got me
most excited about it was that</i>

05:55.763 --> 05:59.524
<i>tunnel from Shaft 12
goes all the way over here.</i>

05:59.609 --> 06:02.986
<i>It connects up with
this structure area over here.</i>

06:04.864 --> 06:05.614
That is very intriguing.

06:05.773 --> 06:08.108
What size is that structure?

06:08.192 --> 06:09.109
Just approximately.

06:09.193 --> 06:10.944
You're looking at...

06:11.028 --> 06:13.121
12 feet by 12 feet, tops.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.207
Okay.

06:15.366 --> 06:17.033
I-I guess I have to wonder,
were they tunneling

06:17.126 --> 06:19.461
there for a purpose,
and then building

06:19.545 --> 06:21.129
an expanded chamber,
if you will, at the end of it?

06:21.214 --> 06:22.205
Yeah.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.209
<i>NARRATOR: A possible
12-foot by 12-foot chamber</i>

06:26.293 --> 06:30.138
<i>some 160 feet deep,
and potentially connected to</i>

06:30.223 --> 06:32.307
<i>a tunnel in the area
where the team has already</i>

06:32.466 --> 06:35.227
<i>detected traces of silver
and gold?</i>

06:35.311 --> 06:38.063
<i>It has become
Marty Lagina's suspicion</i>

06:38.147 --> 06:41.057
<i>that if treasure on
Oak Island really does exist,</i>

06:41.142 --> 06:43.735
<i>it may not be in
the original Money Pit,</i>

06:43.894 --> 06:47.313
<i>but rather in an offset
chamber from the main shaft.</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:50.659
<i>Is it possible that
Jeremy Church has just</i>

06:50.743 --> 06:54.830
<i>found evidence that
Marty's theory is correct?</i>

06:54.914 --> 06:57.490
<i>MARTY: What is interesting
about the anomaly is</i>

06:57.575 --> 06:59.409
<i>it's about the right size.</i>

06:59.493 --> 07:00.910
<i>It appears to be</i>

07:00.995 --> 07:03.997
something that has almost,
like, a little roof on it.

07:04.081 --> 07:05.340
Well, that sounds good.

07:05.499 --> 07:06.842
<i>And it also appears to be</i>

07:06.926 --> 07:08.334
<i>something less dense there.</i>

07:08.428 --> 07:11.921
<i>So, you got a roof, a cap
and something less dense.</i>

07:12.006 --> 07:13.849
<i>That sounds like
a possible chamber.</i>

07:13.933 --> 07:15.767
It's worth drilling, for sure.

07:15.926 --> 07:19.020
STEVE G.: The anomaly we're
chasing that you've presented,

07:19.105 --> 07:22.348
it may help really zone in an
area of interest for us because

07:22.442 --> 07:25.852
soon we've got caissons coming,
and we really need to

07:25.945 --> 07:30.773
- start getting as much data as we can to pick caissons.
- Yep.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.693
<i>CRAIG:
If any of these anomalies</i>

07:33.777 --> 07:35.945
align up with where
we might want to drill,

07:36.038 --> 07:38.457
I-I'd drill for
these anomalies, too.

07:38.616 --> 07:41.201
Yeah, I'd like to put a hole
over by Shaft 12

07:41.285 --> 07:43.453
to see if you find a tunnel.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.622
- Mm-hmm.
- Put a couple holes there.

07:45.706 --> 07:46.715
You find a tunnel,
then it confirms this.

07:46.874 --> 07:48.884
We might get lucky and actually

07:48.968 --> 07:50.460
put a coin in your hand
this year, Marty.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.629
- Okay, good.
- Well, I don't think

07:52.713 --> 07:55.965
there's anything else to say,
other than we have legitimate

07:56.058 --> 07:58.718
targets, and now it's all
about getting out there

07:58.802 --> 08:00.896
and ground-truthing it,
and keep going.

08:01.055 --> 08:03.648

- Yep.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.934
It was a wet bucket,
but right here

10:03.019 --> 10:04.519
it looked like it might have
been a little piece of wood.

10:04.678 --> 10:06.763
Just a small piece.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.231
Okay, mate, I'll see

10:42.299 --> 10:44.217

the archaeologists finding

10:44.301 --> 10:48.647
strips of this
underneath the stone roadway.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.399
It was, like,
used as, like, packing.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.643
And then the stones
were put on top of it.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.154
- It's too small for a fence post.
- Yeah.

10:56.313 --> 10:57.480
You think it's a survey stake,
Billy?

10:57.573 --> 10:59.649
Well, do you remember how
the stakes were pointed

10:59.733 --> 11:01.234
that went along the swamp road?

11:01.318 --> 11:03.078
- The path?
- Yeah.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.904
So, this could be
really interesting if we

11:04.988 --> 11:07.248

11:07.333 --> 11:09.325
- Yeah.
- See how old it is.

- That's cut.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.990
One of these coordinates
is really close to the center

12:31.083 --> 12:32.667
of the projected tunnel
that comes off of Shaft 12,

12:32.826 --> 12:33.659
and this was the closest.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.170
Okay, all right.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.337
So this is
the highest probability

12:36.497 --> 12:38.173

- Has to be.

19:37.500 --> 19:41.012
<i>Although the seismic data
presented by geophysicist</i>

19:41.171 --> 19:44.340
<i>Jeremy Church indicated
that a tunnel might be found</i>

19:44.433 --> 19:47.435
<i>some 30 feet deeper,
is it possible</i>

19:47.594 --> 19:50.679
<i>that the team has encountered
a different man-made structure?</i>

19:50.764 --> 19:53.191
<i>If so, what could it be?</i>

19:53.350 --> 19:56.694
<i>And might it be related
to the traces of silver and gold</i>

19:56.778 --> 20:00.689
<i>that the team detected through
water testing earlier this year?</i>

20:00.774 --> 20:03.618
If there's a tunnel here
that had air in it,

20:03.702 --> 20:06.370
and you drilled into it,
up she comes.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.864
- Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. And then the pressure behind it

20:08.957 --> 20:10.875
would force all the water
up and out.

20:10.959 --> 20:14.545
- Do we think this is a good omen?
- It could be.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.039
Well, just in case it is
some gas, let's step back.

20:17.123 --> 20:20.042
Don't fire up any smokes.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.962
<i>NARRATOR: Although Craig,
Alex and members of the team are</i>

20:41.240 --> 20:42.398
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

20:42.482 --> 20:44.659
All it takes is
one good find out here.

20:44.818 --> 20:46.902
We saved the best till last.

20:46.987 --> 20:49.488
- That does sound different to me, too.
- It does.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.659
<i>just west of the swamp,

20:53.743 --> 20:58.005

search for important clues.</i>

20:59.916 --> 21:02.009
MARTY: Gonna have
to get the rocks out here.

21:04.087 --> 21:05.846
There you go, mate.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.431
This one could be tough.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.103
- Boy, that is just buried in the rocks, Gary.
- Yeah.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.856
It can hide, but it can't run.

21:17.434 --> 21:20.436
- Just get that out of there.
- Yeah, I'm gonna take that out.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.614
All right.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.116
(device beeping)

21:25.275 --> 21:28.861
Oh, yeah, it's been
trapped there a while.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.613
Look at that. I'm going
to pull it out, mate.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.458
- What do we got here?
- What the hell is that?

21:34.617 --> 21:38.287
Look at the size of that.
That is one big spike.

21:38.371 --> 21:40.798
Look at the size of that!

21:40.882 --> 21:42.466
- I mean, that's crazy.
- That looks like a railroad spike, no?

21:42.551 --> 21:45.970
No. I think it's too big
to be a railroad spike.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.806
I mean, it's very,
very heavy as well.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.467
It's like an old wharf pin
or something like that.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.227
I don't know what the heck
it's doing out here.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.563
Well, you know what?
We think there's a wharf,

21:55.722 --> 21:57.898
and we think it was over there,
but we don't really know that.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.058
It could have been right here.

21:59.142 --> 22:00.893
<i>More possible evidence</i>

22:00.986 --> 22:03.988
<i>of a ship's wharf on Lot 32?</i>

22:04.147 --> 22:06.899
<i>And in the same area
where the team found</i>

22:06.992 --> 22:10.486
<i>a potentially ancient
cargo bag seal one year ago?</i>

22:10.579 --> 22:12.913
<i>The burning question
then becomes:</i>

22:12.998 --> 22:15.249
<i>what happened to the cargo?</i>

22:15.408 --> 22:17.326
<i>Could the Money Pit or the swamp</i>

22:17.410 --> 22:19.745
<i>soon provide the answer?</i>

22:19.838 --> 22:21.830
- Is it iron?
- Yeah, it's iron,

22:21.923 --> 22:23.999
and more than likely
wrought iron.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.677
<i>MARTY: I don't really want to
find more spikes on this island.</i>

22:26.762 --> 22:31.090
But, but this particular one
is incredibly massive,

22:31.183 --> 22:33.592
and it was way deep in the soil.

22:33.676 --> 22:35.936
<i>So it's been there
a long, long time.</i>

22:36.021 --> 22:37.438
We'll put it in the XRF.

22:37.597 --> 22:38.931
We'll have Carmen Legge
look at it,

22:39.024 --> 22:41.609
probably Christa Brosseau.
We'll see what they all say.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.027
<i>- GARY: Okay, mate.
- All right.</i>

22:43.186 --> 22:46.697
<i>GARY:
Dang! That is a big spike.</i>

22:46.782 --> 22:50.442
<i>NARRATOR: As Marty and Gary
continue their search on Lot 32,</i>

22:50.527 --> 22:52.620
<i>back at the Money Pit...</i>

22:52.779 --> 22:53.704
<i>BRENNAN:
It's a void.</i>

22:53.789 --> 22:54.872
We drilled through a void.

22:55.949 --> 22:57.699
<i>NARRATOR: after completing
a safety check</i>

22:57.793 --> 23:01.453
<i>for a possible gas leak
in Borehole AB-13,</i>

23:01.538 --> 23:03.372
<i>the team is now confident</i>

23:03.456 --> 23:05.383
<i>that it is safe to
continue investigating</i>

23:05.467 --> 23:10.137
<i>a mysterious void at
a depth of nearly 70 feet.</i>

23:10.296 --> 23:11.213
For air to come out, I mean,

23:11.306 --> 23:12.464
it would have to be
a dry cavity.

23:12.549 --> 23:15.226
Yeah, an open cavity
of some sort. Definitely.

23:15.310 --> 23:18.637
A chamber to put things in
could hold a lot of air,

23:18.721 --> 23:21.140
and it could hold it there
for centuries.

23:21.224 --> 23:24.568
Whether it happened in 2017 or
a century ago, we're not sure.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.492
I think it's bubbling again
or something.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.913
I could see it
when you were drilling.

23:39.826 --> 23:42.044
- Got some bubbles?
- TEDFORD: Bubbles.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.081
BRENNAN: Why don't you
turn the rig off for a second?

23:46.174 --> 23:47.758
Let's see how much airflow
we can hear.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.762
- CRAIG: Bubbling on the outside of the casing.
- Yeah.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.101
- BRENNAN: It's a pretty good flow.
- CRAIG: Yeah, it is.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.854
That's interesting that
we're still having that.

23:59.938 --> 24:03.441
<i>CRAIG: Very unusual. We've
never seen this on the Money Pit,</i>

24:03.600 --> 24:04.358
<i>you know,
so we're trying to figure out</i>

24:04.443 --> 24:06.193
<i>the volume of the air in it.</i>

24:06.278 --> 24:09.363
So it's an exciting find
in this area.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.608
It's at a depth
of about 68 feet.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.861
You know,
it's an unknown depth to us.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.289
You know, there's no records
of anything in that depth.

24:18.448 --> 24:22.543
So, something very positive
and something we have to pursue.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.045
It's exciting. I think
we should go tell the guys.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.789
To me, there's
only one explanation for

24:27.874 --> 24:30.709
an air cavity, and that's
a man-made tunnel.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.553
- I agree.
- At this depth.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.880
CRAIG:
I agree. I'm encouraged.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.640
It's encouraging that we got it.

24:36.799 --> 24:38.634
It's encouraging where
it's at because why is it

24:38.718 --> 24:41.970
at such a shallow depth?
I mean, it's nothing that--

24:42.063 --> 24:45.224
Nothing searchers would
have apparently done,

24:45.308 --> 24:48.143
so hopefully the original
people would have.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.488
Yeah. Let's go see
what my dad and Rick think.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.813
<i>- CRAIG: Okay. Okay.
- ALEX: See you, guys.</i>

24:51.907 --> 24:53.407
<i>- STEVE G.: See you, guys.
- TERRY: See you later.</i>

24:59.331 --> 25:02.082
<i>MARTY: So, guys, weird
stuff yesterday, huh?</i>

25:02.167 --> 25:04.752
<i>- At the latest well.
- ALEX: Yeah, very.</i>

25:04.911 --> 25:08.005
<i>NARRATOR: One day after
the team drilled into a mysterious,</i>

25:08.164 --> 25:10.424
<i>air-filled void in
the Money Pit area...</i>

25:10.583 --> 25:12.510
Give us the numbers again.

25:12.669 --> 25:16.922
We drilled with
the casing down to 68 feet, too.

25:17.015 --> 25:20.017
<i>brothers Rick and Marty
Lagina are heading there</i>

25:20.101 --> 25:22.344
<i>to continue the operation,
along with their partner</i>

25:22.437 --> 25:25.272
<i>Craig Tester
and Marty's son Alex.</i>

25:25.431 --> 25:27.432
<i>CRAIG: As it's coming out of
the hole and all of the sudden,</i>

25:27.526 --> 25:31.687
the water starts squirting out,
obviously being pushed by air

25:31.780 --> 25:36.283
between the casing
and the core barrel.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.785
So, below 68 feet,
you would guess?

25:37.944 --> 25:39.286
- Yes.
- Yeah.

25:39.445 --> 25:43.865
<i>CRAIG: Then he moved the
core barrel down to 88 feet.</i>

25:43.959 --> 25:46.210
All of a sudden the air
started coming out of

25:46.294 --> 25:47.786
the outside of the casing.

25:47.870 --> 25:49.705
I see. Okay.

25:49.789 --> 25:52.624
<i>Was there any smell
associated with it?</i>

25:52.717 --> 25:54.543
That's a great question.

25:54.627 --> 25:56.211
No, we were worried
it might be natural gas,

25:56.296 --> 25:58.514
which, if it's just methane,
does not smell.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.800
<i>MARTY:
Craig tells me that</i>

26:01.893 --> 26:05.554
in the construction of Shaft 12,
the-the searchers had to quit

26:05.638 --> 26:08.307
at 55 feet because they were
flooded out.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.152
<i>I don't know anywhere else
on Oak Island where 55 feet</i>

26:12.312 --> 26:14.154
<i>encounters significant water.</i>

26:16.899 --> 26:18.483
(indistinct chatter)

26:18.568 --> 26:20.494
Hey, guys. How are you?

26:20.653 --> 26:22.246
What are today's mysteries?

26:22.405 --> 26:23.330
Well, there's a few.

26:23.489 --> 26:24.915
- (laughs)
- Okay, guys.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.827
This side of the table,
explain the air to me.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.214
Okay, so, one thing's for sure.
There's a cavity.

26:34.834 --> 26:37.919
And in this terrain,
in that very dense till,

26:38.013 --> 26:40.505
this isn't something
that washed out glacially.

26:41.674 --> 26:43.675
This has got to be a pick
and shovel type of an opening.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.686
So, you're saying

26:45.770 --> 26:47.929
a dead-end tunnel looks
like this.

26:48.014 --> 26:50.182
Yeah, something like that, and
we're close to that dead end.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.610
It's a man-made hole.

26:54.446 --> 26:58.857
<i>NARRATOR: If the team
did, in fact, drill into a tunnel,</i>

26:58.950 --> 27:01.201
<i>could it be the legendary
booby trap that is believed</i>

27:01.286 --> 27:04.705
<i>to feed water into
the Money Pit from Smith's Cove?</i>

27:04.789 --> 27:07.866
<i>Or, because it was
full of air, might it be</i>

27:07.950 --> 27:10.535
<i>a very different kind
of man-made structure?</i>

27:10.629 --> 27:14.882
<i>Perhaps one connected to a vast
cache of silver and gold?</i>

27:17.218 --> 27:19.553
MARTY: And this same
phenomena would occur

27:19.638 --> 27:22.222
for the famous offset chamber,
wouldn't it?

27:22.307 --> 27:24.966
- You'd have the same thing like this?
- Exactly.

27:25.051 --> 27:26.635
And you pierce it here
and it's full of air?

27:26.719 --> 27:28.145
Yep. No question.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.222
Steve? Same thing?

27:30.306 --> 27:32.974
We pierced something that hasn't
been pierced in a long time.

27:33.059 --> 27:36.061
I'm going to make a really quick
point. I think we should

27:36.145 --> 27:38.155
drill close to where we're at
and we should investigate what

27:38.314 --> 27:39.657
we hit yesterday,
but I think we're really close

27:39.816 --> 27:41.492
to a tunnel.

27:43.236 --> 27:44.736
Okay, well, that's pretty cool.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.080
Let's finish up this hole
and go to the next one.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.247
- Which way we going?
- STEVE G.: I would move down

27:47.407 --> 27:50.742
the seismic line three feet.

27:50.827 --> 27:53.495
I think we should come
closer than three.

27:53.579 --> 27:55.580
Two and a half.

27:55.665 --> 27:57.257
- Two and a half.
- Compromise.

27:57.417 --> 27:59.000
MARTY:
Okay. I like that.

27:59.085 --> 28:01.762
- Got that, Steve?
- Two and a half feet west?

28:01.921 --> 28:05.090
- CRAIG: Two and a half feet, rather than three.
- Yep.

28:05.174 --> 28:06.600
<i>RICK:
I would love for them</i>

28:06.759 --> 28:07.843
<i>to be correct that there's</i>

28:07.927 --> 28:10.011
<i>some sort of dry tunnel.</i>

28:10.096 --> 28:12.272
If there is a tunnel and we can

28:12.432 --> 28:14.015
access it, I'd be the first one

28:14.109 --> 28:16.601
in the tunnel,
I can tell you that.

28:16.686 --> 28:19.613

28:51.387 --> 28:52.971
Carmen, we have
some more of our treasures

28:53.064 --> 28:54.356
that we need identified here.

28:56.893 --> 28:59.644
It was found on Lot 32
by my dad.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.239
I find almost nothing, so
I'm really quite proud of this.

29:03.825 --> 29:07.995
ALEX: Lot 32 is on the south side
of the island, close to the swamp,

29:08.079 --> 29:10.914
uh, near where we think there
may have been an old wharf.

29:31.928 --> 29:34.679
ALEX: 'Cause you anchor
your boat out in the ocean.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.097

Not very far.
I'd say maybe 50 feet.

Piece just beyond my bucket,

34:59.097 --> 35:02.507
- Can one of you guys get it?
- Oh, is that a board?

35:02.591 --> 35:05.936
I don't know, mate.
Let me see if I can get it.

35:08.848 --> 35:10.181
We'll keep it to one side.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.016
- It looks like a board.
- It's dimensional enough, yeah.

35:12.101 --> 35:13.693
Yeah, it looks like a board.

35:13.853 --> 35:15.862
One side's pretty smooth.

35:16.021 --> 35:18.690
Oh, they got something.

35:18.774 --> 35:20.951
Look at that, mate.
Looks like a ship's timber.

35:21.035 --> 35:23.194
Probably a piece of decking,
by the look of it.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.612
Good eye, Billy.

35:24.697 --> 35:27.624
Yeah, when you see a flat piece,
it really sticks out.

35:27.708 --> 35:30.710
Yeah. That's cool, mate.
Look at that.

35:30.870 --> 35:34.038
<i>NARRATOR: Another potential
piece of decking from a ship?</i>

35:55.227 --> 35:57.904
<i>RICK: We have

<i>of what we believe

those items should not
be down there,

36:04.653 --> 36:06.571

36:06.655 --> 36:09.908
and that really, certainly,
piques all of our interests.

36:09.992 --> 36:12.076
This is definitely man-made.

36:12.161 --> 36:15.246
It's badly deteriorated, but if

36:15.339 --> 36:18.249
there's an old ship
in the swamp, it would be.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.677
Exactly. We're only
picking up the pieces, right?

36:20.836 --> 36:21.845
Yeah.

36:21.929 --> 36:24.097
JACK:
We'll get it cleaned up, though.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.516
Definitely a candidate for C-14.

very significant.

- Take it away.

37:47.756 --> 37:50.091
It's a plank
that came out of the swamp.

37:50.184 --> 37:53.353
It's about two feet long,
six inches wide,

37:53.512 --> 37:55.605

five to six feet.

38:23.625 --> 38:24.709
Okay.

38:24.793 --> 38:26.469
Makes sense.

38:26.554 --> 38:30.473

39:24.186 --> 39:28.114
<i>a 1652 Spanish maravedi coin
nine years ago,</i>

39:28.199 --> 39:30.858
<i>the triangle-shaped swamp
has produced</i>

39:30.943 --> 39:33.119
<i>a number of corroborating clues</i>

39:33.204 --> 39:35.780
<i>that something extraordinary
happened on Oak Island</i>

39:35.864 --> 39:40.377
<i>long before the discovery
of the Money Pit in 1795.</i>

39:40.461 --> 39:44.038
<i>Many of them, from potential
fragments of ships</i>

39:44.123 --> 39:45.965
<i>to wharfs</i>

39:46.125 --> 39:48.543
<i>and even a man-made rock feature</i>

39:48.627 --> 39:50.878
<i>at the so-called
Eye of the Swamp,</i>

39:50.963 --> 39:52.797
<i>have all scientifically tested</i>

39:52.890 --> 39:56.393
<i>to a period between
the 16th and 17th centuries.</i>

39:56.552 --> 39:59.137
<i>Could that mean
that the team is finally</i>

39:59.221 --> 40:01.648
<i>zeroing in on when
the Oak Island mystery</i>

40:01.732 --> 40:03.400
<i>actually began?</i>

40:03.559 --> 40:05.568
Anyway, we have another
piece of wood that

40:05.653 --> 40:07.728
absolutely suggests

40:07.822 --> 40:10.490
something happening here
long before

40:10.574 --> 40:12.909
- the discovery of the Money Pit.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

40:12.993 --> 40:14.902
So, maybe, just maybe,

40:14.987 --> 40:16.988
we're coming closer
to a "when," but

40:17.072 --> 40:19.240
<i>the "why" still escapes us.</i>

40:19.324 --> 40:20.741
- Mm-hmm.
- MARTY: Yeah. "Who" is a bit

40:20.826 --> 40:24.078
of a problem, and "what" is,
uh, plaguing us, too. (chuckles)

40:24.171 --> 40:26.923
<i>All the Ws are, but the "when,"</i>

40:27.082 --> 40:28.666
that open circle
seems to be closing.

40:28.750 --> 40:31.335
Yeah, there's a whole
coalescing of data around

40:31.429 --> 40:34.755
1650 to 1750.

40:34.840 --> 40:37.091
And then there's some
of these outlier,

40:37.176 --> 40:39.853
really old things
that are really inexplicable.

40:39.937 --> 40:42.013
But we will stay with it
until we find out.

40:42.097 --> 40:44.023
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.191
- We're not giving up.
- MARTY: All right, Rick,

40:45.350 --> 40:46.693
well, we'll let you
get back to your work.

40:46.852 --> 40:49.028
All righty. You guys take care.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.281
<i>I'll be there
as soon as possible.</i>

40:51.365 --> 40:53.032
<i>- MARTY: All right. See you.
- OTHERS: See you.</i>

40:53.117 --> 40:56.202
<i>NARRATOR: With every
clue that Rick, Marty, Craig,</i>

40:56.361 --> 40:58.196
<i>and their team unearth,</i>

40:58.280 --> 41:00.373
<i>one by one, Oak Island secrets</i>

41:00.458 --> 41:02.617
<i>are finally being revealed.</i>

41:02.701 --> 41:04.961
<i>Although the questions of who,</i>

41:05.045 --> 41:08.715
<i>what, when, where,
and why persist,</i>

41:08.874 --> 41:10.124
<i>at least for now,</i>

41:10.217 --> 41:13.044
<i>as the team continues searching
across the island,</i>

41:13.128 --> 41:16.380
<i>digging in the swamp,</i>

41:16.465 --> 41:20.218
<i>and drilling in the Money Pit,</i>

41:20.311 --> 41:22.637
<i>just how much longer</i>

41:22.721 --> 41:25.056
<i>can those questions remain</i>

41:25.149 --> 41:26.983
<i>unanswered?</i>

41:29.728 --> 41:32.396
<i>Next time on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:32.481 --> 41:34.741
Are you ready to put some coil
to the soil, mate?

41:34.825 --> 41:36.234
- I'm ready.
- Let's go for it.

41:36.318 --> 41:37.485
Woo-hoo-hoo! What we got here?

41:37.569 --> 41:38.319
Oh, yeah.

41:38.412 --> 41:40.580
GARY:
Ooh! Look at that, mate.

41:40.664 --> 41:41.739
Is that something?

41:41.823 --> 41:43.908
Wow. That is spectacular.

41:43.992 --> 41:46.669
Why does it have these angles?
Does it cry ship?

41:46.754 --> 41:48.162
It could easily
be part of a ship.

41:48.255 --> 41:50.173
Well, how about that. (laughs)

41:50.332 --> 41:51.758
- Hey, Craig!
- I think they might have it.

41:51.842 --> 41:53.251
- There it is.
- Oh!

41:53.335 --> 41:54.835
What the...? Check that out!

41:54.920 --> 41:57.597
That's a phenomena right there.
