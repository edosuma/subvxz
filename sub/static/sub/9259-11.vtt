00:58.450 --> 01:02.614
- [Man] Now, / need you to tell the truth. 
- Absolutely.

01:02.721 --> 01:07.420
- [Man] /s your name Shane Vendrell?
- Yes.

01:07.526 --> 01:12.429
- [Man] Are you currently
the mayor of New York City?
- [Chuckles] No.

01:14.199 --> 01:18.329
Have you ever lied to
keep yourself out of trouble?

01:18.437 --> 01:20.803
[Shane]
Yes.

01:20.906 --> 01:26.071
[Man] Have you ever won the gold medal
in women's gymnastics?

01:26.178 --> 01:28.840
[Chuckles]
No.

01:28.947 --> 01:32.542
- [Man] Are you married?
- [Shane] Yeah.

01:32.651 --> 01:35.211
- [Man] Do you have children?
- [Shane] Yes.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.782
[Man] Have you ever been unfaithful
to your wife?

01:39.891 --> 01:42.121
[Shane]
No.

01:44.830 --> 01:47.094
Eatin' ain't cheatin'.

01:49.201 --> 01:53.035
I've been fielding calls all day by people
very angry that we put away Antwon Mitchell.

01:53.138 --> 01:55.038
He confessed to
murdering a teenage girl.

01:55.140 --> 01:59.543
Mitchell's always claimed we were targeting
him: now he's screaming that Vendrell's dirty.

01:59.644 --> 02:01.908
- People think we're trying to cover our ass.
- That's bullshit.

02:02.013 --> 02:06.507
I know. I just
need you to explain it to them.

02:13.558 --> 02:16.527
- I'd be a little nervous.
- [Mackey] Yeah.

02:16.628 --> 02:19.358
- So how we supposed to beat this thing?
- Well, it's easier...

02:19.464 --> 02:22.331
if you're a pathological liar
or a narcissist.

02:22.434 --> 02:26.461
All right. So Shane's safe.
What do we do about Army?

02:26.571 --> 02:28.732
I heard something
about putting a tack in your shoe.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.104
- /t messes up the results.
- [Mackey] Along with your foot.

02:31.209 --> 02:34.975
Tack in your shoe. Bar of soap
under the armpit. No proof they work.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.139
Plus, if they catch you,
they know you're lyin'.

02:37.249 --> 02:39.342
- Come on, Smitty. What do we do?
- All right.

02:39.451 --> 02:43.114
You be the interrogator.
Ask me about some crime you think I did.

02:43.221 --> 02:47.351
- You like little Asian boys?
- Let's say I did.

02:47.459 --> 02:51.828
I'd do what they call a substitution.
I'd replace your question in my mind...

02:51.930 --> 02:55.127
with another question
to which the truthful answer is no.

02:55.233 --> 02:59.397
/ might ask myself,
"Do / have $ 10 million in the bank? '"

02:59.504 --> 03:04.305
And I answer "no." The polygraph
records the response as truthful.

03:04.409 --> 03:07.606
- [Army] And that really works?
- /f you do it right, yeah.

03:07.712 --> 03:10.704
- Oh.
- [Mackey] Got no choice.

03:10.816 --> 03:15.276
Captain's got a spotlight on all of us
until you two pass that lie detector test.

03:15.387 --> 03:20.154
We got a few days to practice.
We can do it.

03:20.292 --> 03:22.522
[Monica] The officer
Mitchell propositioned was undercover.

03:22.627 --> 03:25.960
- We heard he was corrupt.
- [Monica] That was Mitchell's allegation.

03:26.064 --> 03:28.157
- We're investigating.
- [Woman] / was at your first town meeting.

03:28.266 --> 03:32.600
- [Monica] Yes. I remember.
- That councilman said
these seizures breed corruption.

03:32.704 --> 03:35.867
/ have the officers involved
taking a polygraph test.

03:35.974 --> 03:38.101
I will be happy
to make those results public.

03:38.210 --> 03:41.509
We also hear you're trying to blame Antwon
for those two dead police.

03:41.613 --> 03:44.844
- We're investigating all leads.
- Investigate yourself.

03:44.950 --> 03:48.386
Taking people's houses is what got
those cops killed. Now you're trying to hide it.

03:48.487 --> 03:50.682
How much longer
you gonna let these seizures go on?

03:50.789 --> 03:53.280
[Monica] We don't know
what got those officers killed...

03:53.391 --> 03:57.555
but attacking the seizure policy
isn't gonna help us find it.

03:57.662 --> 04:00.495
We're reevaluating the seizures entirely.
This department is not interested...

04:00.599 --> 04:05.059
in any policy that inflames the community
or leads to cops'deaths.

04:05.170 --> 04:08.037
[Onlookers Murmuring]

04:12.978 --> 04:15.742
Here. The files you were lookin' for.

04:15.847 --> 04:18.611
Nailin'Antwon's really
shakin'things up.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.652
- What's the fallout on the street?
- Uh, naturally...

04:21.753 --> 04:24.847
decapitating the One-niners
has created a power vacuum.

04:24.956 --> 04:28.289
Now a few of his sloppy seconds
wanna try on the crown.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.157
So how do we take advantage?

04:31.263 --> 04:34.096
Hit 'em up for info on the two dead cops
before the dust settles.

04:34.199 --> 04:38.431
At least until Antwon sets up shop
in prison, circles the wagons again.

04:38.537 --> 04:41.870
You think Antwon's lying,
One-niners are responsible?

04:41.973 --> 04:44.441
Don't you?

04:47.212 --> 04:51.774
- Hit 'em hard.
- Fine. But I need Shane and Army.

04:51.883 --> 04:54.010
- Not until they clear the polygraph.
- That's not till next week.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.349
I need guys now.

04:56.454 --> 04:59.855
Just let 'em work on who killed Carl
and Scooby, nothin' else.

05:01.893 --> 05:05.329
They only work the cops' murders.

05:05.430 --> 05:09.890
- Anything goes sideways with them, it is on you.
- Got it.

05:10.035 --> 05:12.299
[Rap On Radio]

05:12.404 --> 05:14.565
[Shane]
Looks like Antwon Mitchell...

05:14.673 --> 05:16.834
isn't the only One-niner
on his lawyer's buddy list.

05:16.942 --> 05:22.107
- I knew that shylock was dirty.
- Officer of the court runnin' errands
for Antwon Mitchell?

05:22.213 --> 05:25.410
- Gives us a good card to play with Halpern.
- Yeah.

05:25.517 --> 05:28.145
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doin'?
- Lighting up.

05:28.253 --> 05:31.848
No, no. No, you're not. I finally got something
nice where the A/C actually works.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.118
- Toss it.
- I'll blow the smoke out the window.

05:34.225 --> 05:38.025
Or you could blow me. I want this to smell
like Corinthian leather, not an ashtray.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.097
Come on.

05:46.638 --> 05:50.404
/ heard what happened this morning.
Phillips really threw you to the wolves.

05:50.508 --> 05:53.705
Yeah. He hauled me in front of
Antwon's true believers and promised them...

05:53.812 --> 05:56.440
that he would
reevaluate the seizure policy.

05:56.548 --> 05:58.914
It's a real shame you weren't there
to witness your handiwork.

06:00.852 --> 06:03.980
He's linking it to Carl and Scooby
getting killed. Is it?

06:04.089 --> 06:06.114
[Sighs]

06:07.759 --> 06:10.284
We don't know.

06:10.395 --> 06:13.694
If you can prove the killings had nothing
to do with the seizures-

06:13.798 --> 06:16.266
However it breaks, it breaks.

06:16.368 --> 06:19.201
I'm not suggesting slanting evidence.
I'm offering you an olive branch.

06:19.304 --> 06:21.272
High enough to hang myself from?

06:21.373 --> 06:24.069
I don't like people
capitalizing on cop killings.

06:26.277 --> 06:30.646
/'m willing to talk to the chief
on your behalf, on behalf of the seizures.

06:30.749 --> 06:35.311
- lf?
- /f you agree to a few modifications...

06:35.420 --> 06:39.550
such as no auctioning properties
until the suspects are actually convicted.

06:39.658 --> 06:42.559
That leaves money
in escrow accounts for years...

06:42.661 --> 06:45.061
instead of in the community,
where we need it.

06:45.163 --> 06:47.131
It's an olive branch.

06:49.134 --> 06:53.230
Thanks for your offer.
I think I can take care of Phillips.

07:02.180 --> 07:05.513
And listen.
Anybody gives you shit, you come find me.

07:05.617 --> 07:08.643
- You get on the horn, and you call me.
- Go get your nails done, girls.

07:08.753 --> 07:10.653
We need some quality time
with big papa.

07:10.755 --> 07:12.586
- [Halpern] All right, guys.
- Screw.

07:14.526 --> 07:16.585
What? You already
got Antwon sittin' down.

07:16.695 --> 07:19.493
That deal we were discussin' prior
to your accident? It's back on the table.

07:19.597 --> 07:22.259
What is it with you guys? I look like
I got a pork chop around my neck?

07:22.367 --> 07:25.734
Antwon's lawyer went straight from the men's jail
to a meet and greet with a cat named Weed.

07:25.837 --> 07:28.203
- You know him?
- Yeah.

07:28.306 --> 07:31.469
- [Shane] I thought you were next in line, Halpern?
- White smoke comin'out...

07:31.576 --> 07:33.476
of Antwon's cell, man.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.046
Means he's anointing Weed
as his new pope of dope.

07:36.147 --> 07:38.638
We're tryin' to figure out
whose side we're on.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.447
[Chuckles]
You fools still playin' that dirty cop shit?

07:42.554 --> 07:46.115
- [Chuckles]
- Hey, shithead. We don't wanna
get in business with you.

07:46.224 --> 07:48.124
We're lookin' for the guys
who killed our cops.

07:48.226 --> 07:50.456
I already gave you
the El Salvadorans.

07:50.562 --> 07:55.329
No one specific. All we got to
was that street-level asshole, Pitarrio.

07:55.433 --> 07:59.870
You've been out of I.C. U: you reconnected
to the street. You must've heard something new.

08:02.006 --> 08:04.839
[Mackey] This guy's not a player.
Let's go talk to Weed.

08:04.943 --> 08:08.242
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

08:10.381 --> 08:15.409
When Antwon got with the Salvadorans,
he only talked to one guy...

08:15.520 --> 08:17.545
a cat named Gusano.

08:17.655 --> 08:20.852
- Where do I find this maggot, Gusano?
- He deals to Pitarrio.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.860
Now, how you gonna
handle Weed for me, huh?

08:23.962 --> 08:29.867
- You're lookin' at a bunch
of bona fide Weed whackers.
- [Grunts]

08:29.968 --> 08:35.565
[Shane] Hey, Weed.
You wanna hang up the phone, superstar?

08:35.673 --> 08:38.767
- [Mackey] Grab some skull, dickhead.
- You know what's funny, man?

08:38.876 --> 08:41.778
I see your mouth movin',
but I don't hear you sayin' nothin'.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.110
Yeah? Can you hear me now?

08:44.215 --> 08:47.582
Any of you guys smell
the sickly sweet odor of ganja?

08:47.685 --> 08:50.176
Yeah. All right. Come on, man.
This the 21 st century.

08:50.288 --> 08:54.247
That old-school trickery,
it ain't gonna fly in these last days.

08:54.359 --> 08:57.192
You'll be locked up a week
before the judge drops the charges.

08:57.295 --> 09:00.924
Antwon's gone, man.
One-niners are decidin' who's got next.

09:01.032 --> 09:03.364
Can you really afford
to be benched for that long?

09:03.468 --> 09:07.029
Especially with Halpern
on the campaign trail.

09:07.138 --> 09:11.404
Look. Check this out, man.
Quit "beatin' me in my head" conversation.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.239
- What is it y'all want?
- You give us something that
gets us our cop killers...

09:14.345 --> 09:16.870
I guarantee ya Halpern
goes down in the polls.

09:23.021 --> 09:27.515
All right. Word on the street. Some kids
runnin' their mouth 'bout some dead cop's gun.

09:27.625 --> 09:31.391
- Where'd you hear that shit?
- Nigga named Jamani
staying down on Grape Street.

09:31.496 --> 09:34.260
He runs guns
to the street struggle.

09:34.365 --> 09:39.268
So Halpern really wants to squabble, huh?
You got my back, right?

09:39.370 --> 09:43.773

kissin' your ring before you know it.

- Nah. Get me later.

- Dutch hates Giovanni's.

We've papered the town with flyers.

Scooby and Carl, but /'ve got Vic looking into it...

13:35.139 --> 13:37.573
We're comin' in! We'll shoot!

13:37.675 --> 13:40.405
- [Woman] Me too.
- Stop!

13:48.119 --> 13:51.179
- [Mackey] Where's Pitarrio?
- Gone.
- Where to?

13:51.289 --> 13:54.884
He lost something he was holding. He knew
the Salvadorans would come to kill him.

13:54.992 --> 13:58.621
[Mackey]
What did he lose?

14:01.799 --> 14:04.233
Heroin. A kilo.

14:04.335 --> 14:06.860
Shit.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.565
Where did he lose this kilo?

14:09.674 --> 14:12.700
Look, we're not here to bust you.

14:12.810 --> 14:18.373
[Sighs] I'm Pitarrio's cut-up girl.
The Salvadorans can't find him...

14:18.483 --> 14:20.610
they'll come after me next.

14:20.718 --> 14:24.176
- / thought you were them.
- Then why'd you come back here?

14:24.288 --> 14:28.418
I thought maybe I could
grab some product or some tools to sell.

14:28.526 --> 14:32.326
Pitarrio left without paying me.

14:32.430 --> 14:35.297
/ got nothing for us.

14:35.399 --> 14:40.063
- Who's gettin' you and Pitarrio so scared?
- [Whimpering]

14:40.171 --> 14:42.639
Dealer named Gusano.

14:42.740 --> 14:46.938
You know where we could find him?

14:49.046 --> 14:52.072
Vic? Vic? Come here.

14:52.183 --> 14:55.641
She was here when I roughed Pitarrio up
and took that heroin as collateral...

14:55.753 --> 14:57.721
so if she's runnin',
it's 'cause of me.

14:57.822 --> 14:59.653
- She see you take it?
- I don't know.

14:59.757 --> 15:04.285
- Come on, man. Let's just get out of here.
- And leave her hangin'? No way.

15:04.395 --> 15:09.856
- [Shane] What do we do?
- Pack a bag. Pack a bag. Let's go.

15:09.967 --> 15:13.164
What exact-
What exactly did you tell him?

15:13.271 --> 15:17.207
- I told him we were seeing each other.
- Yeah? How'd he take it?

15:17.308 --> 15:21.005
He said you two weren't exactly
the strangers you said you were.

15:21.112 --> 15:25.572
Well, we've bumped heads
over a case or two, but you know Vic.

15:25.683 --> 15:28.049
We need to talk about this.

15:28.152 --> 15:31.883
Listen, I hate to do this to you,
but I'm looking at a dead body right now.

15:31.989 --> 15:35.618
- I've gotta go.
- Okay. I'll still see you at 8:00?

15:35.726 --> 15:38.160
Sure. If this case wraps up, sure.

15:38.262 --> 15:40.253
Okay.

15:40.364 --> 15:45.802
[Claudette] Louis Saldera.
Twenty-one. Took four shots at close range.

15:45.903 --> 15:49.737
- Do we know the car yet?
- Saldera's registered owner of a 2003 Honda.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.808
Still wet.
Maybe there's a witness.

15:51.909 --> 15:56.243
Somebody was here recently. You're not gonna
wash your car with a dead body next door.

15:56.347 --> 15:59.043
Don't be so sure.

15:59.150 --> 16:04.247
/'ll post a squad car out front,
but trust me. No one's gonna find you.

16:04.355 --> 16:08.951
Gusano thinks I know
where Pitarrio is or that I have the heroin.

16:09.060 --> 16:12.223
Last woman he thought crossed him,
his man held her down...

16:12.330 --> 16:15.197
stuck a rat in her pussy
till she bled to death.

16:16.934 --> 16:20.028
That's a street fairy tale
cholos have been spinning for years.

16:20.137 --> 16:23.903
Well, something happens to me...

16:24.008 --> 16:26.943
make sure somebody takes care
of my boy.

16:27.044 --> 16:29.911
Nothing's happening.
Let me take care of Gusano.

16:30.014 --> 16:33.643
- After that, things could change.
- I'm out of a job.

16:33.751 --> 16:36.015
I can't exactly
collect unemployment...

16:36.120 --> 16:39.612
and H-cutter don't look good
on no résumé.

16:39.724 --> 16:44.388
You could
clean up your act, start fresh.

16:46.397 --> 16:48.297
I don't see
where you have much of a choice.

16:48.399 --> 16:53.302
I'm helping you this time.
Next time, I'll be arresting you.

16:54.839 --> 16:58.275
Besides, how old's this kid?
Two? Three?

16:58.376 --> 17:00.344
Four.

17:01.412 --> 17:05.712
Four? He seems small.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.751
We take care of ourselves.

17:10.788 --> 17:13.814
But the good news is
this gun guy, Jamani, works alone.

17:13.924 --> 17:17.484
- Come on, dude. Put that shit out.
- This is my car.

17:17.595 --> 17:21.190
Okay. This guy deals in filed-down guns
and sawed-off shotguns.

17:21.299 --> 17:24.564
- You gotta be careful.
- We'll try not to get your hair messed up.

17:24.669 --> 17:27.968
[All Laughing]

17:28.071 --> 17:31.633
- I can't go through with this lie detector.
- [Shane] That's jitters.

17:31.742 --> 17:35.007
We'll get you back to Smitty's,
get you strapped in.

17:35.112 --> 17:37.842
We got three days
to practice.

17:37.948 --> 17:41.179
Are we gonna beat this thing
based off the tips of a goddamn locksmith?

17:41.285 --> 17:44.049
Smitty was Army Intelligence
for 12 years before he got into keys.

17:44.155 --> 17:46.055
Dude, I was in the service.
A.I. just means...

17:46.157 --> 17:48.523
he was carrying extra batteries
for the field radio.

17:48.626 --> 17:53.495
Look, man, Vic put his ass
on the line for us. So did these guys.

17:53.597 --> 17:56.930
- Wejust need to be calm and concentrate.
- Shit.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.969
Answer these questions that we ask ourselves.
We're gonna get through this.

18:00.071 --> 18:02.198
- Bro-
- Don't "bro" me.

18:02.306 --> 18:06.140
This is a team,
and it all comes down to us delivering.

18:06.243 --> 18:08.143
We're not gonna
let these guys down.

18:08.245 --> 18:13.012
Let's go find this asshole
and see what he knows.

18:13.117 --> 18:15.881
[Monica] We hear you fix guns
for Grape Street, Jamani.

18:15.986 --> 18:18.546
Anyone approached you
with a slain officer's gun?

18:18.656 --> 18:21.591
- You got some bad information.
- We found three silencers and a stash...

18:21.692 --> 18:23.922
of unregistered handguns
in your crib.

18:24.028 --> 18:26.792
Unless you wanna
hone your legal skills at Soledad...

18:26.897 --> 18:29.661
you'd better tell us
about the gun you heard about.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.667
African cat stepped to me with it.

18:31.769 --> 18:33.794
Somebody need the numbers
filed off.

18:33.904 --> 18:37.897
- What kind of piece?
- Beretta 92-F.

18:38.008 --> 18:42.172
But / told Kunta Kinte he could
take that business somewhere else.

18:42.279 --> 18:45.305
He came in actin'all arrogant,
high and mighty and shit.

18:45.416 --> 18:49.352
- This dude called me a nigger, like "G-E-R."
- [Monica] What's his name?

18:49.453 --> 18:53.719
- I don't know.
- I need you to look at some mug books.

18:53.824 --> 18:57.555
Nah. Later for that.
I didn't even get a good look at him.

18:57.661 --> 19:01.062
Hey, man, this guy's
great-great-great grandpappy...

19:01.165 --> 19:04.134
sold one of
your ancestors to the man.

19:04.235 --> 19:07.898
You really wanna let him get away
with actin' like he's better than you?

19:10.474 --> 19:14.501
/ heard something loud. / came over
to the window to see what it was.

19:14.612 --> 19:18.048
- What did you see?
- No one's gonna know your name.

19:18.149 --> 19:22.245
I only saw one car.
It was dark blue and old.

19:22.353 --> 19:25.049
This was about a minute
after the shots.

19:25.156 --> 19:28.683
- 1990s? '80s?
- /'m really not good with cars.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.091
Older, I think, like a classic.

19:32.496 --> 19:35.329
We're back from the car wash.
The victim was a Latino.

19:35.433 --> 19:38.027
- He was killed during the carjacking.
- Girl heard the shots.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.262
She didn't see the killer,
but she saw a witness.

19:40.371 --> 19:42.498
"The shooter had Los Mag gang tats.
He drove the stolen car.

19:42.606 --> 19:46.201
Two other Latino males
followed him in a black BMW."

19:46.310 --> 19:49.746
Sounds like your witness called in. Wouldn't
give his name, but he caught a lot of detail.

19:49.847 --> 19:52.247
- [Dutch] 911 get his number?
- No. He called the switchboard.

19:52.349 --> 19:54.909
He knew how to keep his name
and voice out of it.

20:04.462 --> 20:09.126
- What you got?
- Unis papered the neighborhood
for this Nigerian named Ade Achebe.

20:09.233 --> 20:11.929
He lives here.
He was tryin' to clean a cop's gun.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.800
- From the make, it looks like Carl's.
- Any connection to the Niners?

20:14.905 --> 20:18.671
Haven't seen one,
but he's on a Homeland Security watch list.

20:18.776 --> 20:21.802
So is every African
that's entered the country since 9/11.

20:21.912 --> 20:24.972
What's the big deal?
You could fit 'em all in a phone booth.

20:26.851 --> 20:31.015
Ronnie, Army, take the back.

20:31.121 --> 20:34.318
- [Curtis] We got a warrant?
- Just my winning smile.

20:34.425 --> 20:37.155
Anybody else
hear those cries for help?

20:39.396 --> 20:41.864
Police.

20:45.603 --> 20:48.800
- Here we go. Here.
- [Dog Barking Wildly]

20:51.075 --> 20:53.373
[Continues Barking]

20:53.477 --> 20:57.573
- 6-Paul-11. [Echoes]
- Whoa.

20:57.681 --> 21:01.310
- That's another radio. Hit it again.
- [Static Echoes]

21:01.418 --> 21:04.182
- Keep hittin' it.
- 6-Paul-11.

21:04.288 --> 21:06.620
- 6-Paul-11.
- [Static]

21:06.724 --> 21:09.659
Test, one, two. Test, one, two.
[Echoes]

21:09.760 --> 21:13.196
Hey. Scooby's.

21:13.297 --> 21:15.527
- [Ronnie] Test, one, two.
- Shit.

21:17.635 --> 21:21.731
- So somebody executed our best lead?
- We found Scooby's radio.

21:21.839 --> 21:24.103
- Any guns?
- No.

21:24.208 --> 21:26.699
Well, he could've bought that radio
in a pawn shop.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.869
[Mackey]
Or took it from him after he killed him.

21:28.979 --> 21:31.106
This guy couldn't
subdue Carl and Scooby on his own.

21:31.215 --> 21:34.651
The whole neighborhood knew
we were lookin' for a Nigerian.

21:34.752 --> 21:37.915
Maybe his accomplices heard too
and tried to tie things up.

21:38.022 --> 21:41.924
It feels like it's moving away from Antwon.
Might not even be seizure-related.

21:42.026 --> 21:46.725
I wouldn't rule him out just yet. We haven't
found his Salvadoran hookup, Gusano.

21:46.830 --> 21:50.425
- This reads mob to me.
- The neighbors are screaming "blue justice"...

21:50.534 --> 21:53.435
payback for one of our own.

21:53.537 --> 21:57.837
Let them stick their fingers up his ass.
He's been cold for hours. We just got here.

21:57.942 --> 22:03.539
We just need to get a fix on what direction
this is going. El Salvadorans? Nigerians?

22:03.647 --> 22:05.911
Just get me answers.

22:07.251 --> 22:09.515
We should talk to Vic.
Maybe he could find out...

22:09.620 --> 22:12.088
if our dead guy was beefing
with another gang.

22:12.189 --> 22:15.716
- We can do anything he can do.
- Including dating his wife?

22:15.826 --> 22:18.260
Ex-wife, and we're friends.

22:18.362 --> 22:21.354
You wanna keep secrets,
go ahead...

22:21.465 --> 22:25.231
but when it starts interfering
with our investigations, give it up.

22:25.336 --> 22:29.136
It's just weird timing right now.
Maybe you should be the one to talk to him.

22:29.239 --> 22:31.833
Where you goin'?

22:33.344 --> 22:36.643
Blue classic car,
well-maintained?

22:38.282 --> 22:41.410
- That's a classic?
- /t is to Billings.

22:41.518 --> 22:44.544
- You're not serious.
- Witness knew enough to call the switchboard...

22:44.655 --> 22:46.646
instead of 911.

22:46.757 --> 22:48.748
You're just mad at him
because he took our cases.

22:48.859 --> 22:51.157
Witness with a spot-on knowledge
of gang tattoos.

22:51.261 --> 22:54.924
- Still not there yet.
- That's dried soap.

22:55.032 --> 22:58.195
I thought he was supposed
to be getting you lunch.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.327
So what's up?

23:01.438 --> 23:04.737
[Dutch] We're stuck
on this carjacking murder...

23:04.842 --> 23:07.538
thought you
might be able to help us out.

23:07.645 --> 23:12.105
- Sure.
- Anything you wanna tell us about it?

23:12.216 --> 23:16.084
- What do you mean?
- The anonymous caller
who witnessed the shooting...

23:16.186 --> 23:18.086
provided a lot of detail-
very thorough.

23:18.188 --> 23:21.157
Called the switchboard,
recognized gang tats.

23:21.258 --> 23:25.217
Your car is streaked with dried soap,
like you rushed out without having time to rinse.

23:25.329 --> 23:27.388
Dried soap?

23:27.498 --> 23:31.161
We had Nicole's blood in O.J.'s bedroom,
and look at what good that did us.

23:31.268 --> 23:35.500
- Give me a break.
- We got the bills back from the car wash.

23:35.606 --> 23:38.734
Your fingerprints were
on some of them.

23:38.842 --> 23:41.606
You guys must have broken the world record.
I can't get anything...

23:41.712 --> 23:43.976
back from those lab rats
in less than a day.

23:44.081 --> 23:47.448
So it'll take a day, but when it does
come back, are we gonna find yours?

23:50.821 --> 23:53.654
All right. I was there.

23:53.757 --> 23:56.692
And now I'm here, because I didn't feel
like committin' suicide today.

23:56.794 --> 24:00.992
Come on. / was 15 feet away from two
armed bangers who already had their guns out.

24:01.098 --> 24:05.296
That's not bein' a coward.
That's livin' to fight another day.

24:05.402 --> 24:09.338
- Why didn't you report it?
- I called in and told 'em what I saw, every detail.

24:09.440 --> 24:13.638
- If I didn't care, would I have done that?
- You should've called us instead.

24:13.744 --> 24:17.441
- Why? So the people here could
think I didn't do something to stop it?
- Did you?

24:17.548 --> 24:20.415
I was outnumbered
and outgunned.

24:20.517 --> 24:23.782
Come on. You know you can't
show any weakness in this house.

24:23.887 --> 24:26.185
You saw how they treated Reynolds
when they caught him bawlin' his eyes out...

24:26.290 --> 24:29.782
in the locker room, or Lowe
when his boyfriend threw a hissy fit.

24:29.893 --> 24:33.556
- They still make fag jokes behind his back.
- It wouldn't be like that.

24:33.664 --> 24:36.792
After what happened to Carl and Scooby,
everybody's looking over their shoulder.

24:36.900 --> 24:42.736
They give us this badge and a gun,
and they expect us to act like Superman.

24:42.840 --> 24:47.277
Like I'm not some middle-aged guy who could
use a few more hours a week on the treadmill.

24:48.479 --> 24:52.040
You're both smart.
You got the facts.

24:52.149 --> 24:55.710
I gotta work
with the people here.

24:55.819 --> 24:58.287
Keep me out of this?

25:09.633 --> 25:13.763
- What are you doin'?
- I'm practicin' for the damn polygraph.

25:15.272 --> 25:18.366
Listen, dude.
You're gonna pass it.

25:21.678 --> 25:24.738
And after you do,
you should get out.

25:27.451 --> 25:30.443
- For real?
- Look, this team gets into a lot of shit.

25:30.554 --> 25:33.921
- You're tellin' me now?
- We always say we're through, okay...

25:34.024 --> 25:37.255
but if you're not in 100%,
split while the going's good.

25:39.129 --> 25:43.498
'Cause you're either built
for it or you're not.

25:43.600 --> 25:48.560
- [Door Opens]
- Hey, techies pulled a slug
out of that dead guy's wall.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.663
Ballistics don't match
Carl or Scooby's guns.

25:50.774 --> 25:52.969
I.N.S. gave us his roommate
off an expired visa.

25:53.076 --> 25:58.070
- Idisa Okoye.
- It's "okoye" with me if it's "okoye" with you.

25:58.182 --> 26:01.049
Sponsored by a family
out of Long Beach.

26:01.151 --> 26:03.312
If Okoye executed his roomie, he's gonna need
a place to hide for the next few days...

26:03.420 --> 26:06.856
so grab your swimsuits:
we're headed to Long Beach.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.355
[Birds Squawking]

26:12.462 --> 26:16.660
- Lem, Ronnie, go around back.
- [Curtis] You got it, man.

26:16.767 --> 26:19.531
[Curtis]
Come on, Ronnie. Let's go down the side.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.602
Idisa Okoye? Is he here?

26:27.711 --> 26:29.975
- Is he inside?
- Speak English?

26:30.080 --> 26:34.039
- [Speaking Nigerian]
- [Mackey] Idisa? Idisa?

26:34.151 --> 26:37.314
- [Woman Screaming]
- [Mackey] Get 'em out ofhere.

26:37.421 --> 26:42.085
- [Screaming Continues]
- Army. Army, get these kids out.

26:42.192 --> 26:45.025
- [Mackey] Police.
- [Shane] Come on, buddy. Come here.

26:45.128 --> 26:48.256
- Come on!
- [Screaming Continues]

26:48.365 --> 26:51.300
- [Man Speaking Foreign Language]
- Sounds Russian.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.665
- You ready? Go!
- [Gunfire]

26:53.770 --> 26:57.831
- Cover.
- [Gunfire Continues]

27:01.378 --> 27:03.471
He's empty!

27:03.580 --> 27:07.038
[Grunting]

27:07.150 --> 27:10.745
- [Shane] Don't move.
- [Crying]
- You all right?

27:16.093 --> 27:18.789
[Gunshot]

27:41.752 --> 27:44.585
- [Gun Cocks]
- [Gunfire]

27:44.688 --> 27:48.351
He's down! He's down!

27:49.559 --> 27:53.154
[Groans]

27:53.263 --> 27:55.197
Shit.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.632
- Vic. Hey, thank you.
- Yeah.

27:58.735 --> 28:00.862
[Sirens Wailing, Distant]

28:00.971 --> 28:04.338
- Vic!
- [Sirens Grow Louder]

28:08.445 --> 28:11.005
- [Officer] Don't move!
- [Shane] Hey, hey, man!

28:11.114 --> 28:14.777
- We're cops, Farmington cops.
- You wanna shoot somebody, / volunteer this guy.

28:16.954 --> 28:20.048
[Siren Chirping]

28:20.157 --> 28:23.649
We responded to shots fired, :
we found this guy fleeing from the scene.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.661
He involved in the shooting?

28:26.763 --> 28:29.357
It's Idisa Okoye. Sister lives here.

28:29.466 --> 28:32.026
Yeah, well,
we found this on him.

28:34.271 --> 28:39.231
It's Carl's. Hey, man,
you just snagged yourself a cop killer.

28:44.381 --> 28:46.815
[Chattering]

28:48.685 --> 28:51.017
- Where's your partner?
- He's in the restroom.

28:51.121 --> 28:54.318
/'ve got a murder
/ could use some help on.

28:54.424 --> 28:57.257
/'ll be with you in a second.

29:04.835 --> 29:07.804
I heard you're banging my ex.

29:07.904 --> 29:11.897
- Trying to get my attention?
- No. We met-

29:12.009 --> 29:16.070
/ hope you're
thinkin'that through.

29:19.783 --> 29:25.551
And by the way, we just picked up one
of the guys who killed Carl and Scooby.

29:25.655 --> 29:31.218
- That's great.
- Yeah. Weren't you primary on that?

29:32.696 --> 29:37.099
Well, we're all here
to help each other out, right? Right?

29:40.937 --> 29:44.873
You are in deep shit.

29:44.975 --> 29:48.001
We know
you killed two police officers.

29:48.111 --> 29:50.636
I didn't kill anybody.

29:50.747 --> 29:55.616
Why were two Russians
holding your family hostage, waiting for you?

29:57.020 --> 29:59.511
Let's start with the cops.

29:59.623 --> 30:02.854
Did Antwon Mitchell
hire you to kill them?

30:02.959 --> 30:07.419
- Who?
- Why were the bodies left in a seized house?

30:12.702 --> 30:15.500
Look, I don't know how it works
back home in Lion Country, but here...

30:15.605 --> 30:18.073
you get the needle for killin' cops.

30:18.175 --> 30:21.372
Give yourself a chance,
you start talkin', namin' names.

30:24.881 --> 30:30.478
You say I killed someone:
I say you are wrong.

30:30.587 --> 30:34.250
They found the police radio
in your apartment.

30:34.357 --> 30:37.087
You had one of their guns
on you when they picked you up.

30:37.194 --> 30:40.493
Both were taken off the bodies
after they were killed.

30:42.966 --> 30:47.130
I am tired now.
I am going to take a nap.

30:55.512 --> 30:57.776
Okay. Settle down.

30:57.881 --> 31:01.817
Now, even cop killers
have rights.

31:01.918 --> 31:05.752
Sleeping just
isn't one of them.

31:10.961 --> 31:13.327
This guy doesn't even know
to ask for a lawyer.

31:13.430 --> 31:15.398
You give me the night, I'll get him
to own up to stabbing our guy.

31:15.499 --> 31:19.060
It just doesn't add up.
Why are the Russians involved?

31:19.169 --> 31:22.002
- We'll figure it out.
- Looks like it has nothing to do with the seizures.

31:22.105 --> 31:24.596
- Isn't that a good thing?
- Yes.

31:24.708 --> 31:27.939
The Russian guy from the house
won't say a word...

31:28.044 --> 31:30.012
but I tied him
to Carl and Scooby.

31:30.113 --> 31:34.140
They pulled his boss over a few weeks back,
clocked him doing 50 in a school zone.

31:34.251 --> 31:38.654
They got into some kind of argument,
and they tossed the guy in lockup overnight.

31:38.755 --> 31:43.158
- What?
- Carl liked to get in people's faces.

31:43.260 --> 31:46.491
They got killed
over a speeding ticket?

31:54.471 --> 31:56.735
[Dutch] We need you
to /.D. the shooter on the record.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.775
- [Billings] Why?
- [Claudette] Unis pulled over the stolen car.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.037
- He was Los Mag, long rap sheet.
- So why do you need me?

32:02.145 --> 32:05.308
Because he's not talking. We don't know
who his accomplices are.

32:05.415 --> 32:08.145
- We didn't find a murder weapon.
- You guys are the best detectives here.

32:08.251 --> 32:11.220
Tell him you got 10 witnesses.
Break this asshole and get him to confess.

32:11.321 --> 32:14.222
We tried.
You're our only eyewitness.

32:14.324 --> 32:17.521
- [Claudette] / know you're scared.
- [Billings] Come on.

32:17.627 --> 32:21.427
Can you honestly say you wouldn't
have done the same thing?

32:21.531 --> 32:25.558
/ know /'m an asshole for asking,
but, please, take another crack at this guy.

32:25.669 --> 32:28.638
- I'm beggin'.
- Well, don't.

32:39.683 --> 32:44.450
Ever heard of Andrei Tretiak?
He's Russian organized crime...

32:44.554 --> 32:47.648
same as the comrades who are
holding your family hostage.

32:47.757 --> 32:51.124
You're safe and sound here
in the police station, but what about them?

32:51.228 --> 32:54.254
They already
killed your roommate.

32:54.364 --> 32:57.856
We stopped them before
they raped and tortured your family.

32:59.903 --> 33:04.772
Next time, they'll be quick.
They might let the kids live...

33:04.874 --> 33:10.710
but only if they cut their eyes out
so they can't be identified.

33:10.814 --> 33:15.274
[Monica] But it's over for you. /t was over
the moment you killed our two officers.

33:15.385 --> 33:19.981
But I'm giving you a chance to save the lives
of your sister and the rest of them.

33:28.632 --> 33:32.591
- How would you protect them?
- We'd move them out of state.

33:32.702 --> 33:36.194
But you'd have to give us a statement
and leave nothing out.

33:41.177 --> 33:44.772
- [Mackey] Did Tretiak hire you?
- I can't say.

33:44.881 --> 33:47.907
Achebe arranged everything.

33:48.018 --> 33:51.215
Well, while we're
gluing his brains back together...

33:51.321 --> 33:54.984
you give us something
on these Russians.

33:55.091 --> 34:00.495
- Just did what Achebe asked.
- [Monica] And what was that?

34:01.765 --> 34:05.292
Well, he was given names
and pictures.

34:05.402 --> 34:10.806
We followed them, your officers.
We waited for our opportunity.

34:10.907 --> 34:15.867
Then they went into an apartment,
so we opened a manhole cover.

34:15.978 --> 34:21.382
When they came back,
we told them we heard a child below...

34:21.484 --> 34:24.715
so they bent down to look.

34:24.821 --> 34:29.417
That's when I stabbed the Asian one
in the back of the neck.

34:29.525 --> 34:35.431
He was paralyzed,
couldn't move his arm.

34:35.532 --> 34:39.628
But the other one, the black one,
he fought hard.

34:39.735 --> 34:43.194
So / went to help Achebe.
We stabbed him-

34:43.306 --> 34:46.639
We kept stabbing him,
but he wouldn't die.

34:48.277 --> 34:52.112
And then we heard the Asian one.

34:52.215 --> 34:55.241
He was still breathing...

34:55.351 --> 35:00.813
so I went, took him down
and finished him as well.

35:00.924 --> 35:03.791
Cut him here.

35:06.429 --> 35:09.694
And then we carried them
into the building...

35:09.799 --> 35:12.768
the one you had stolen...

35:12.869 --> 35:16.771
just as Achebe was instructed.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.039
- [Mackey] We straight? Let's go.
- [Knocking]

35:25.148 --> 35:28.174
- Yeah?
- Hey.

35:28.284 --> 35:30.878
I just wanted to say
that it really means a lot to everyone...

35:30.987 --> 35:34.616
that you guys nailed those assholes
who killed Carl and Scooby.

35:34.724 --> 35:36.954
This old team
still has a few new moves.

35:37.060 --> 35:40.325
- Yeah.
- Still gotta get the Russian string pullers.

35:40.430 --> 35:44.093
Also, we got a lead on Antwon's
Salvadoran connection, a guy named Gusano.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.361
You still think
Antwon's involved?

35:46.469 --> 35:50.496
Oh, we think he might be connected
somehow. We're on the way there now.

35:50.607 --> 35:54.634
Shane and Army have other business first.
Polygraph in 10 minutes.

35:54.744 --> 35:57.269
- Gang Central.
- [Mackey] / thought that was next week.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.474
You know the public pressure
we're getting on this.

36:00.583 --> 36:03.347
/f / have to stand up for this team,
/ need assurances, and / need them now.

36:03.453 --> 36:08.152
If you can put it off till tomorrow,
this Salvadoran might fill in some blanks for us.

36:08.258 --> 36:11.159
These two are staying.

36:11.261 --> 36:14.890
Anyway, good work.

36:23.139 --> 36:26.370
Did you have
to get such a pretty tester, Captain?

36:26.476 --> 36:31.038
- Try and relax.
- I'm just saying you got my heart rate up.

36:31.147 --> 36:34.583
Could you take a few points off
for me, darlin'?

36:34.684 --> 36:37.619
I'm gonna ask you a series
of questions first just to make sure...

36:37.720 --> 36:39.620
the machine's working properly.

36:39.722 --> 36:42.691
- Okay.
- Make your answers accurate and honest.

36:44.594 --> 36:47.654
[Machine Beeps]

36:49.866 --> 36:54.326
- Is your name Shane Vendrell?
- Yes.

36:54.437 --> 36:56.769
- [Chattering]
- Gusano.

36:56.873 --> 37:01.867
- What's up, man?
- /'m here to talk about Pitarrio
and his heroin cutter...

37:01.978 --> 37:03.912
Emolia Melendez.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.208
- Cops?
- [Door Opening]

37:06.316 --> 37:10.946
- Yo, man. /t's a friendly visit.
- [Gusano] Since when are cops bein' so friendly?

37:11.054 --> 37:16.492
Pitarrio lost something of yours.
Emolia was worried that you might blame her too.

37:16.593 --> 37:19.756
/ helped her to get it back.
Now /'m helping to make it right.

37:19.863 --> 37:22.161
Here.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.730
[Spanish]

37:33.409 --> 37:36.503
Tell her to relax, :
don't even trip.

37:36.613 --> 37:40.549
As soon as I tell you to stay the hell away
from her and her kid.

37:46.222 --> 37:49.521
Thank you very much.
/t's very nice to meet you.

37:49.626 --> 37:52.288
- Hey, it's not that bad.
- [Monica] Army, let's get started.

37:52.395 --> 37:55.228
- I'm not taking it.
- You're what?

37:55.331 --> 37:58.198
I talked to my P.B.A. rep,
and he said I can refuse to take it.

37:58.301 --> 38:01.031
But we got-
we got nothing to hide.

38:01.137 --> 38:05.767
And I can't get penalized for it either.
He said polygraphs are subjective...

38:05.875 --> 38:09.470
and the results aren't worth shit,
and that's why they're not admissible in court.

38:09.579 --> 38:13.709
- This isn't about covering your own ass.
- [Exhales Sharply]

38:13.816 --> 38:15.807
We have to prove
that we didn't set up Antwon.

38:15.919 --> 38:18.888
If people believe that,
they'll think we framed our cop killer.

38:18.988 --> 38:22.321
- Everything will fall apart.
- I'm sorry. That's not my problem.

38:24.994 --> 38:29.055
It is about everyone in here...

38:29.165 --> 38:31.360
and how people think of us
out there.

38:32.902 --> 38:35.700
You are screwing every single cop
in this building.

38:35.805 --> 38:40.003
This has nothing to do with anybody else.
This is about taking care of me.

38:45.281 --> 38:48.773
- The guy's just nervous-
- No! It's too late.

38:51.821 --> 38:53.789
[Door Slams Shut]

38:55.592 --> 38:58.959
The injunctions are keeping the gangs indoors.
/'m surprised to say it...

38:59.062 --> 39:01.622
but Monica's policies
are really starting to take an effect.

39:01.731 --> 39:03.858
The public sees us
as having our boot on their neck.

39:03.967 --> 39:06.492
- When does the press get good on this?
- We're seeing a difference.

39:06.603 --> 39:08.764
Somebody just has to report it.

39:08.871 --> 39:13.205
- Don't shut it down now.
- [Aceveda] She brought down
Antwon Mitchell, for Chrissake.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.437
- You've been pissing on
her policies. Why the change?
- /'m allowed to reevaluate...

39:16.546 --> 39:18.639
my position,
as long as she's willing to also.

39:18.748 --> 39:23.014
- I really think there's a middle ground
we can be happy with.
- Like what?

39:23.119 --> 39:28.056
No. Compromise, retreat
is the worst thing we can do...

39:28.157 --> 39:31.718
and you'd be abandoning the memory
of those two dead cops and all they fought for.

39:31.828 --> 39:34.956
Christ. Don't play that card with me.
Most people in this town...

39:35.064 --> 39:37.726
still think they were killed
because of your seizure policy.

39:37.834 --> 39:41.600
Well, they weren't.
It seems it was a traffic dispute.

39:41.704 --> 39:45.105
Do we know that for sure? Is there any proof
we can put in front of the people?

39:45.208 --> 39:50.407
I'll find it.
As for the seizures, they stay, or I go.

39:50.513 --> 39:54.711
Then you can tell the brass how you lost
one of L.A. 's two female captains...

39:54.817 --> 39:57.980
because she was too tough
on crime.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.685
[Door Slams]

40:05.328 --> 40:07.558
Hey.

40:11.034 --> 40:13.400
l- Oh.

40:17.774 --> 40:22.268
/ took care of Gusano.
He's not gonna be a threat to you anymore.

40:22.378 --> 40:26.246
You can stay here for a few more days,
but after that...

40:26.349 --> 40:28.874
/ can only
fudge the paperwork for so long.

40:28.985 --> 40:31.112
We'll be fine.

40:32.722 --> 40:36.158
How's this little guy?

40:36.259 --> 40:39.626
- Has he been to a doctor?
- Sure.

40:41.230 --> 40:44.131
What'd they say?

40:44.233 --> 40:49.261
I gotta make him eat,
get him into a preschool.

40:49.372 --> 40:55.140
He used to talk more,
but some of the stuffhe's seen-

40:55.244 --> 40:57.542
I'd keep my mouth shut too.

41:04.821 --> 41:08.814
I'll go pick up a few things,
make you guys a little more comfortable.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.950
Maybe that'll get him
back to talking.

41:11.060 --> 41:13.028
Thanks.

41:25.241 --> 41:28.699
He confessed.
Kept your name out of it.

41:28.811 --> 41:32.212
- Thanks. Really.
- You're welcome.

41:34.450 --> 41:37.248
- How 'bout I buy you both a beer?
- No, thanks.

41:37.353 --> 41:40.254
Can't.
I've gotta be somewhere.

[Chuckles Ruefully]

41:57.874 --> 42:02.834
- Vic's put me through hell, but
never anything this malicious.
- He just said that to hurt us.

42:02.945 --> 42:05.846
- So you're not trying to get close
to me just to get back at him?
- No.

42:05.948 --> 42:08.007
Absolutely not.

42:10.486 --> 42:15.549
Maybe at first a little,
but I really like you now.

42:17.493 --> 42:22.123
Look, / put up with Vic's shit every day,
so is asking you out a perk?

42:22.231 --> 42:26.565
Sure. Vic's an asshole.

42:26.669 --> 42:31.106
He's the father of my children.
That makes him my asshole, not yours.

42:34.177 --> 42:37.510
- It's not where we started: it's where we are now.
- It started with a lie.

42:37.613 --> 42:41.014
I don't even know
where we are now.

42:41.117 --> 42:44.644
- I'm sorry.
- You think this is easy for me, dating again?

42:44.754 --> 42:48.747
I told you it was a bad idea,
but you kept pushing it.

42:48.858 --> 42:51.258
- What about my kids?
- I love your kids.

42:51.360 --> 42:55.319
You weren't honest with me before.
How can I even trust you with them now?

42:55.431 --> 42:58.594
- Or trust myself to you?
- Corrine.

43:00.036 --> 43:02.971
You can leave, okay?

43:10.613 --> 43:14.674
l- l- I am sorry.

43:25.995 --> 43:28.088
It was nothing
you couldn't handle: I told you that.

43:28.197 --> 43:30.631
- I don't have to handle it.
The P.B.A. guy told me that.
- You'd trust him before us?

43:30.733 --> 43:33.600
Damn right! I mean,
he may not be as well-versed in these things...

43:33.703 --> 43:36.968
as an ex-army locksmith,
but I'll take my chances.

43:37.073 --> 43:39.132
- You stupid shit.
- Hey, hey...

43:39.242 --> 43:41.972
your P.B.A. genius,
he gonna get you your next job?

43:42.078 --> 43:45.639
- He's gonna keep me out of court.
- Toss your career if you want...

43:45.748 --> 43:48.182
but you made us all look guilty
when you blew off that test.

43:48.284 --> 43:50.684
- You are guilty!
- Shh.

43:50.786 --> 43:53.482
Who's the one who lost it and shot Halpern?
I know I didn't.

43:53.589 --> 43:55.887
Which makes me guilty too.

43:55.992 --> 43:59.393
Hey, maybe Army's right.

43:59.495 --> 44:01.520
/t's as good a time
as any for him tojump.

44:01.631 --> 44:04.691
No reason we can't leave
as friends.

44:04.800 --> 44:09.100
Captain is right.
You are screwin' people over.

44:09.205 --> 44:13.039
- You're screwin' this team over.
- This team? Look, that bullshit
never worked for me...

44:13.142 --> 44:16.202
when I was pullin' sand out of my ass
in the desert: it's not workin' for me now.

44:16.312 --> 44:19.907
I didn't take a bullet over there: I'm not
gonna take a bullet here, not for you guys.

44:20.016 --> 44:22.780
I appreciate your honesty.

44:22.885 --> 44:25.046
Let's go.

44:33.729 --> 44:35.788
[Exhales Sharply]

44:35.898 --> 44:38.526
- I vouched for him. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

44:38.634 --> 44:42.229
We have to shake the Russians, figure out
how this all comes back to Antwon.

44:42.338 --> 44:45.774
- You think it does?
- There's only one guy who can
get all the Salvadorans...

44:45.875 --> 44:48.901
Russians, Africans
and One-niners all in the same bed.

44:49.011 --> 44:51.707
- [Curtis] Antwon.
- We just got out from
underneath Antwon's shadow.

44:51.814 --> 44:53.714
- Why shake a stick at a hornet's nest?
- Because anyone...

44:53.816 --> 44:58.219
who had anything to do with killing Carl
and Scooby has to pay.

44:58.321 --> 45:03.418
Plus I got eight missing months
of kickin' ass with you guys to make up for.

45:04.460 --> 45:06.451
