00:06.170 --> 00:08.161
("Captain Sunshine"
by Lucy Schwartz playing)

00:19.180 --> 00:20.477
You'll be great.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.080
Oh, God, it's like I'm a
first-time lavwer again.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.042
How many cases have you argued?

00:25.090 --> 00:26.648
423.
So...

00:26.690 --> 00:28.180
this'll be your 424th.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.585
My last.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.599
It's my last one as a lawyer.

00:32.630 --> 00:35.519
I just don't want to finish
by embarrassing myself.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.198
Then don't.

00:38.430 --> 00:41.661
You're always so good
with the pep talks, aren't you?

00:41.700 --> 00:45.704
* Make way
for Captain Sunshine... *

00:48.540 --> 00:51.668
You want a tattoo.

00:51.710 --> 00:54.543
I want a tattoo?
Mm-hmm.

00:54.580 --> 00:59.415
'Cause it'll hurt so, so good.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.859
You know what I feel?

01:00.890 --> 01:02.528
What?

01:02.560 --> 01:04.187
Awake.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.198
Probably best
when your eyes are open.

01:06.230 --> 01:08.357
No, really awake.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.664
Like I haven't been in a while.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.669
What are you doing tonight?

01:13.700 --> 01:15.668
What am I doing?

01:15.700 --> 01:17.463
I have no idea.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.535
I want to see you again.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.536
See me now.

01:21.580 --> 01:23.548
No. I'm serious.

01:23.580 --> 01:25.571
See me now.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.281
* Captain

01:30.320 --> 01:31.742
* Mm, mm*

01:31.790 --> 01:34.554
* Sunshine.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.287
(music stops abruptly)
What?

01:37.330 --> 01:39.218
I have to go to school,
and everyone's already here.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.420
Oh, my God.

01:40.460 --> 01:41.620
I overslept.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.830
I was out.

01:46.870 --> 01:49.566
I was really out.
I know.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.259
You probably just
needed to sleep.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.538
But I have to go.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.207
Um, you be good today.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.707
You're the mom today.

01:55.740 --> 01:56.877
Uh, brush your teeth

01:56.910 --> 01:58.548
and do not_lose
any more clients.

01:58.580 --> 02:01.777
I'll do my best.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.811
(indistinct chatter)

02:05.190 --> 02:06.657
Where did you say
you wanted this, Alicia?

02:06.690 --> 02:08.180
Oh, in front
of the fireplace.

02:08.220 --> 02:09.380
Sorry, we had to start early.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.681
The workers were here.
CAREY:
It's a go.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.425
We have a lead
on offices.
Where?

02:12.460 --> 02:13.688
Wallis & Frey.
The tax firm?

02:13.730 --> 02:14.628
Yeah, they're breaking up.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.423
The new lavwers
are kicking out the old.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.562
And they want us to lease
their empty offices?

02:17.600 --> 02:18.760
Really?
Wallis & Frey?

02:18.800 --> 02:20.165
That's great.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.202
Not-not that I don't
love you all here.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.468
(doorbell rings)
ROBYN:
Oh.

02:23.510 --> 02:24.329
That's probably the broadband.
I'll get it.

02:24.370 --> 02:26.429
How-how much is_ the lease?
We're trying

02:26.480 --> 02:27.777
to find out now.

02:27.810 --> 02:29.641
Good morning.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.739
Good morning. You're...

02:31.780 --> 02:33.645
Marilyn, yes. The chair
of your husband's

02:33.680 --> 02:35.341
ethics commission.
I-I know.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.610
Um, what can...
Uh, why are you here, Marilyn?

02:37.650 --> 02:39.754
I'm sorry to throw myself
at you like this, Alicia,

02:39.790 --> 02:41.951
but I only discovered today that
you're starting your own firm,

02:41.990 --> 02:43.321
and I wanted to catch you

02:43.360 --> 02:44.588
before...
Before I made too many mistakes?

02:44.630 --> 02:46.598
No, no, no. Not
at all. It's just

02:46.630 --> 02:48.518
that the ethic rules for the
governor can be qUIte...

02:48.560 --> 02:52.337
counterintuitive. Uh, you know,
they've changed a lot even

02:52.370 --> 02:53.530
in the past few months...
Broadband?

02:53.570 --> 02:54.969
Yeah, right this way.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.265
Um, Marilyn, could we do this
another time?

02:58.310 --> 02:59.732
Heather?
Hello.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.668
Alicia, oh, my gosh.
What happened?

03:01.710 --> 03:03.849
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you go by work?

03:03.880 --> 03:06.713
Someone else is in your office,
a man who told me to get lost.

03:06.750 --> 03:07.569
Yeah, 1-1 was going to...

03:07.620 --> 03:09.588
Marilyn, can we do this
another time?

03:09.620 --> 03:10.882
Certainly.
MAN: Pardon me.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.251
Do you want me to drop by
this afternoon?
Yes.

03:12.290 --> 03:13.587
N-No. Let me figure it out,
okay?

03:13.620 --> 03:15.451
Definitely.
I'll drop by.

03:15.490 --> 03:17.378
What was that?
Oh, nothing.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.227
Just someone
from my husband's staff.

03:19.260 --> 03:22.696
I wanted to tell you:
I left Lockhart/Gardner.

03:22.730 --> 03:23.822
And I'm starting

03:23.870 --> 03:26.236
my own firm.
Here?

03:26.270 --> 03:28.397
No. (chuckles)
This is temporary.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.805
We move into office space
Fnday.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.637
But shouldn't you be in court?
Yes.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.605
It's just... I've mostly dealt
with you, Alicia, not Diane.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.609
So I'm just... a bit confused.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.868
Well, you are
in good hands.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.615
It's just...
I've worked a lot on your case,

03:41.650 --> 03:45.609
and I'm quite familiar with it.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.355
Your Honor...
(clears throat)

03:49.390 --> 03:51.950
I find the defense's motion
to dismiss galling...

03:51.990 --> 03:53.491
I'm sorry.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.657
I didn't mean to "gall" you.
She is suggesting

03:55.700 --> 03:58.692
there is no way ever to
sue a gun manufacturer.
I'm suggesting

03:58.730 --> 04:00.436
that Congress passed
the Lawful Protection

04:00.470 --> 04:01.869
of Commerce in Arms Act.
A reprehensible law.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.868
I know that that's
your opinion, Your Honor,

04:03.910 --> 04:05.662
but it is still the law.

04:05.710 --> 04:08.531
And if I may, Your Honor, if you
don't feel that you can judge

04:08.580 --> 04:11.003
fairly...
I feel I can judge very fairly,
thank you,

04:11.050 --> 04:12.540
no matter how destructive

04:12.580 --> 04:13.842
your client's product
is to America.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.040
Your Honor, it is
true that the act

04:15.080 --> 04:18.686
passed by Congress outlaws suits
against gun manufacturers,

04:18.720 --> 04:20.051
but there are exceptions.

04:20.090 --> 04:22.627
This gun, a Decatur .38 Lobera,

04:22.660 --> 04:26.721
misfired and killed the husband
of my client.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.524
Your Honor, even if she can
prove that it was defective,

04:29.570 --> 04:30.889
the gun was fired
during the commission

04:30.930 --> 04:33.535
of a crime. Therefore,
the manufacturer cannot be sued.

04:33.570 --> 04:36.664
My client's husband
was the victim of a crime.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.666
He was held up and killed
at his place of business

04:38.710 --> 04:40.007
by two robbers.
Yes, but the gun

04:40.040 --> 04:41.701
was fired during
a criminal act.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.605
His gun. The victim's gun.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.402
Not the robber's.
Yes, but it was fired...

04:45.450 --> 04:47.577
Misfired.
...when the robbers
slapped it out of his hands.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.973
Therefore, he was not
in possession of it.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.511
Thus, it was fired
during a criminal act.
Thank you.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.689
I'll have to ask both attorneys
to join me

04:53.720 --> 04:55.415
in chambers.
Um...

04:55.460 --> 04:57.428
why?
An administrative issue.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.592
DAVIES:
Please, everybody.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.789
Take a seat.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.660
Let's just take a breath

05:10.710 --> 05:12.735
before we start
in on this.
Um, start in with...

05:12.780 --> 05:14.532
what?
You, too, Nancy.

05:14.580 --> 05:15.774
Here.

05:15.810 --> 05:19.519
Everybody, take a
big, long breath.

05:19.550 --> 05:22.986
Now, I've received a request
for a change of representation

05:23.020 --> 05:24.612
from you, Heather.
Is that true?

05:24.650 --> 05:26.857
Yes.
Your Honor, my firm

05:26.890 --> 05:28.755
recently fired ten lawyers
who were

05:28.790 --> 05:30.087
poaching clients.
We weren't poaching.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.529
What else would you call it?

05:31.560 --> 05:32.857
You were negotiating
with our top clients

05:32.900 --> 05:33.924
behind our back.
All right,
everybody, please,

05:33.960 --> 05:35.450
please, please.
Unclench your fists.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.468
Okay? Look at...
look at your fist.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.127
Squash it. Come on.

05:39.170 --> 05:42.037
Squash it. I work
with kids in gangs.

05:42.070 --> 05:43.401
That's what we say.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.566
Squash it.

05:45.710 --> 05:47.575
There you go.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.872
Diane,

05:48.910 --> 05:50.138
you have something to say?

05:50.180 --> 05:52.478
Yes. I am personally offended,
Your Honor.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.010
I've been developing this case
for two years.

05:54.050 --> 05:55.870
ALICIA:
No, you haven't, Diane. We have.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.808
Cary and myself...
I took on this case.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.886
I brought it
to this point...
Your Honor, these are the bills

05:59.920 --> 06:01.854
segregating out
hours based

06:01.890 --> 06:03.858
on partner
and associate work...
Where did you get those?

06:03.890 --> 06:05.448
Billing is not an effective way

06:05.490 --> 06:06.457
to determine work.
It's not

06:06.500 --> 06:07.751
an effective way?
What other way would you...

06:07.800 --> 06:10.519
(overlapping arguing)
Okay, okay, okay.
Everybody, please.

06:10.570 --> 06:13.539
Please, please. Okay?
We were doing so well.

06:13.570 --> 06:15.731
Come on. Squash it.

06:15.770 --> 06:16.805
Everybody, come on.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.762
Let's see it.

06:18.810 --> 06:20.573
Come on.

06:22.810 --> 06:24.141
There we go.

06:24.180 --> 06:26.045
Heather, it is unorthodox

06:26.080 --> 06:28.071
to switch representation
on the first day of motions,

06:28.120 --> 06:30.042
especially with Diane
already commencing.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.819
So I'm going
to ask you.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.909
Diane?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.484
Or Alicia
and Cary?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.124
What is it?
Heather, I have made it

06:37.160 --> 06:38.923
my life to fight
for gun control.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.054
This is the wedge issue
to drive into the PLCAA.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.920
Alicia and Cary.

06:43.970 --> 06:46.632
ALICIA:
Your Honor, we have an immediate
request for your assistance.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.888
The client's files,
all two years of files,

06:48.940 --> 06:50.931
we need to have them transferred
to our law firm.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.631
What law firm? You're working
out of your apartment.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.908
Well, we're
in the process

06:53.940 --> 06:56.773
of finding new office...
Your Honor,
we need the case files.

06:56.810 --> 06:57.970
They don't belong
to Lockhart/Gardner.

06:58.010 --> 07:00.808
They belong
to our client.
Agreed. Diane, have them sent

07:00.850 --> 07:03.148
to, um...
CARY:
Florrick-Agos & Associates.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.182
When can
we expect delivery?

07:07.790 --> 07:10.782
How'd it go?

07:10.830 --> 07:12.229
They took it.

07:12.260 --> 07:13.227
My case.

07:13.260 --> 07:14.591
What? Who?

07:14.630 --> 07:16.427
Who do you think?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.692
Where are you going?

07:18.730 --> 07:20.698
To get it back.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.709
(indistinct chatter)
Oop, sorry.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.833
I hope you don't mind.
We had problems

07:25.870 --> 07:26.905
with the kids' toilet.

07:26.940 --> 07:27.907
ROBYN:
How was court?

07:27.940 --> 07:29.908
We got it.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.612
(cheering)
How much do Wallis & Frey
want for their lease?

07:32.650 --> 07:34.208
Uh, it wasn't what we expected.
They want us to join them.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.912
Join their firm?
Yes, we'd split
the office space,

07:36.950 --> 07:38.941
the lease, the clients.
Do we want that?
o.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.810
They're tax attorneys.
With office space.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.849
CARY:
Yeah, but we
just got out

07:41.890 --> 07:42.652
from under Lockhart/Gardner.

07:42.690 --> 07:43.520
Do we really want
to throw ourselves

07:43.560 --> 07:45.755
back into another
corporate Situation?

07:45.790 --> 07:47.257
ANTHONY:
I don't think so.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.949
Marilyn?
Mm-hmm?

07:49.000 --> 07:49.967
Hello.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.820
Oh, hi.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.235
Uh, I hope you don't mind.

07:53.270 --> 07:54.760
I just needed a glass of water.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.892
No, I thought you were calling
this afternoon.

07:55.940 --> 07:56.759
Oh.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.005
And I thought
I was just dropping by.

07:59.040 --> 07:59.938
I hope this doesn't
inconvenience...

07:59.980 --> 08:01.732
What do you need?

08:01.780 --> 08:03.042
I just need to
take your firm

08:03.080 --> 08:05.503
through a short PowerPoint
on the ethical rules

08:05.550 --> 08:07.279
of a start-up.
Uh, I've heard the rules.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.517
I'll tell them the rules.
We don't have time.

08:12.050 --> 08:14.553
I'm sorry to be rude.
May I use your restroom?

08:14.590 --> 08:15.716
Yes. Are you all right?
Can you show me?

08:15.760 --> 08:16.727
Right this way.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.751
(gags)

08:20.300 --> 08:22.996
(retching)

08:23.030 --> 08:25.692
Ms. Garbanza?

08:25.730 --> 08:27.163
Hello? Are you all right?

08:27.200 --> 08:29.168
(moans)

08:29.200 --> 08:31.839
(panﬁng)
I'm sorry.

08:31.870 --> 08:33.679
No.
(coughing)

08:33.710 --> 08:36.201
Not at all. Can I..._
can I get you something?

08:36.240 --> 08:37.901
(retches)
Maybe a hand towel,

08:37.950 --> 08:39.975
if you don't mind.
Yes, of course.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.682
(moaning)
Here.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.245
Is it, uh, food poisoning?

08:45.290 --> 08:47.019
It's morning sickness.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.550
Really?

08:48.590 --> 08:50.182
Congratulations.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.322
Have you read
What to Expect

08:51.360 --> 08:52.952
When You're Expecting?
(chuckles)

08:53.000 --> 08:54.956
Yes.
It's awful, isn't it?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.764
Well, yeah,
they don't sugarcoat it.
Did you read

08:57.800 --> 08:59.324
the chapter
on pregnancy complications?

08:59.370 --> 09:01.099
Oh, you shouldn't read that.
Everybody gave
me a copy.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.869
I have eight books.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.605
I couldn't
not read it.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.733
I'm sorry I came by.
I know you're very busy.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.237
That's okay.
It's your job.
Yes, it is.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.204
What a silly job, making sure
other people follow the rules.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.718
How long will it take

09:15.750 --> 09:17.786
to see
your PowerPoint?
20 minutes.

09:17.820 --> 09:19.287
(knocking)
CARY:
Alicia.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.810
We need to get to court.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.828
Yeah. One minute.

09:22.860 --> 09:25.158
Why don't you come by tomorrow
at 3:00? We'll do it then.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.691
Okay.

09:26.730 --> 09:28.891
Okay?
(sighs)

09:28.930 --> 09:31.763
Do you want me to call...
Oh, no. It's okay. I just want
to sit here for a minute.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.997
I'll get you
a glass of water.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.701
Alicia.
Yeah.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.765
You're very nice.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.675
(chuckles)
I'll be right back.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.701
(indistinct chatter)

09:46.780 --> 09:48.077
Uh, Mom, some boxes.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.611
Oh, good, Cary.
The files arrived.

09:50.650 --> 09:51.810
You're kidding.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.010
I underestimated them.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.880
(gasps)
What?

09:54.920 --> 09:58.356
CAREY:
Or overestimated them.
Uh-oh.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.052
"To Florrick-Agos, we
are doing our best to...

10:01.100 --> 10:03.295
"process your request.
And in the meantime,

10:03.330 --> 10:05.969
"please accept the contents
of your desks

10:06.000 --> 10:07.888
"as a goodwill gesture.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.703
Will Gardner, managing partner."
I can't believe

10:09.740 --> 10:11.731
they'd endanger their
own clients to get back at us.

10:11.770 --> 10:12.805
It's not their client anymore.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.229
They don't give a damn.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.741
Come on.

10:18.780 --> 10:19.940
ROBYN:
Where, to court?

10:19.980 --> 10:21.948
No, he'll be expecting that.

10:21.980 --> 10:23.641
The plan is simple.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.908
We are in a superior position
to branch out

10:25.950 --> 10:28.418
from Chicago to New York
and then L.A.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.223
But we need to act now.

10:30.260 --> 10:31.955
I have clients wondering
about our losses...

10:31.990 --> 10:35.858
David, when I'm
finished, you can talk.

10:35.900 --> 10:39.222
The first move is
to destabilize our competitors.

10:39.270 --> 10:42.660
These are the top 12 litigators
at competing firms.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.837
I want you to select one name

10:44.870 --> 10:46.804
and target him
or her for acquisition.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.899
Do you understand?

10:49.950 --> 10:52.771
David, you can talk now.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.913
I'll be right back.

10:57.220 --> 10:59.711
(moaning)

10:59.760 --> 11:01.182
Mr. Gardner?

11:01.220 --> 11:02.756
Uh...

11:02.790 --> 11:04.781
this came for you.

11:09.130 --> 11:11.166
You got a subpoena
from them?
(laughs)

11:11.200 --> 11:13.395
What?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.396
They want their files.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.169
And they're taking us
to court for them?

11:17.210 --> 11:19.007
No. The ACDB.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.871
DAVID:
What the hell is that?
The Attorney Disciplinary Board.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.878
Oh. That's the board that...?

11:22.910 --> 11:25.777
Suspended me. Alicia does have
a sense of humor,

11:25.810 --> 11:26.947
I'll give her that.

11:26.980 --> 11:28.948
Don't let her get
into your head.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.948
No.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.413
That's where I want her.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.991
Thank you, Your Honor. I know
that the plaintiff's team is

11:48.040 --> 11:50.167
somewhat in flux,
so if they would like me

11:50.210 --> 11:51.359
to summarize
my motion again...

11:51.410 --> 11:52.809
No, Nancy, we read
the court transcripts,

11:52.840 --> 11:54.307
and we ask Your Honor to deny

11:54.340 --> 11:55.375
her motion to dismiss.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.298
You are rejecting
the Protection of Arms Act...?

11:57.350 --> 11:59.238
No, Your Honor, it is
the law of the land.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.872
Your Honor, I know
that your sympathies

12:00.920 --> 12:02.808
tend against
my client.
Nancy, stop playing me.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.738
Sorry, I'm not.
I'm speaking from my heart.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.987
I, myself, have never
fired a gun in my life,

12:08.020 --> 12:09.385
but what matters
to me is justice.

12:09.420 --> 12:10.853
Good for you.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.050
The difficulty

12:12.090 --> 12:13.227
I'm having, Alicia, and, um...

12:13.260 --> 12:14.397
Cary. Agos.

12:14.430 --> 12:16.227
Cary. Is that Nancy
is right on the law.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.161
If the gun is fired during
the commission of a crime...

12:19.200 --> 12:21.930
Yes, Your Honor, but we don't
know if it did go off during

12:21.970 --> 12:23.835
the commission of_ a crime.
They were holding up
a car wash, so...

12:23.870 --> 12:26.009
They were accused
of holding up a car wash.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.473
One is dead, and the other
is currently on trial

12:27.510 --> 12:28.738
in the Cook County
criminal court,

12:28.780 --> 12:31.169
and no determination has been
made on his 9th or innocence.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.349
Nancy?

12:33.380 --> 12:34.517
Any thoughts?

12:34.550 --> 12:36.415
Your Honor,
he's being prosecuted.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.281
Yes, and if he is found
"not guilty,"

12:40.160 --> 12:42.958
to decide whether
there was indeed a crime.

12:42.990 --> 12:44.218
That is exactly right.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.818
We will wait
for the determination

12:45.860 --> 12:46.997
from the criminal court.

12:47.030 --> 12:48.895
In the meantime,
we will address the question

12:48.930 --> 12:50.898
of the product's defect.

12:50.930 --> 12:52.989
(indistinct chatter)

12:53.040 --> 12:54.894
Nancy?

12:54.940 --> 12:56.862
Nancy?!

12:56.910 --> 12:59.162
Do your friends in the front row
agree or disagree?
What?

12:59.210 --> 13:01.337
Um, Your Honor,
if that is your ruling,

13:01.380 --> 13:04.042
we have no _choice
but to achIesce.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.570
(gavelbangs)
I'll take criminal court.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.146
I know how the SA
will prosecute this.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.272
Great, and I'll go
to Disciplinary Board

13:08.320 --> 13:09.241
and get our files.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.986
Will will be there.
Are you okay with that?

13:11.020 --> 13:12.419
I'm great with that.

13:12.450 --> 13:14.111
GENEVA:
Your Honor, this is

13:14.160 --> 13:15.980
a signed confession
by Lee St. George,

13:16.020 --> 13:18.056
the accomplice to this man.

13:18.090 --> 13:20.923
Objection. Mr. St. George
hanged himself

13:20.960 --> 13:22.291
while in Cook County jail,

13:22.330 --> 13:23.820
so we have no way
to corroborate this.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.064
GENEVA: Your Honor,
it doesn't matter.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.795
He confessed
to robbing the car wash.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.405
Olivia, you
got a second?

13:35.440 --> 13:38.546
I got a 19-year-old kid
who was duped into a robbery,

13:38.580 --> 13:39.911
and is facing 20 years.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.076
What do you think?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.439
I think I can help you.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.380
Really? Why?

13:44.420 --> 13:45.512
I think your
guy's innocent.

13:45.550 --> 13:47.484
(laughs)
Oh, come on.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.023
Olivia, I know we've
butted heads in the past,

13:50.060 --> 13:51.027
but let me help you.

13:51.060 --> 13:53.494
Geneva Pine likes to sit
on her Brady material.

13:53.530 --> 13:56.328
You think she's withholding
exculpatory evidence?

13:56.360 --> 13:59.363
I think that she sometimes likes
to build momentum in her case,

13:59.400 --> 14:01.493
and then, let the evidence
magically appear.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.640
DEERFIELD:
Hello, everyone.

14:14.680 --> 14:17.217
Welcome to _
the Attorney Compliance

14:17.250 --> 14:21.118
and Disciplinary Board
where we handle disputes

14:21.160 --> 14:24.482
between lawyers
in a collegial manner.

14:26.390 --> 14:29.894
And welcome back, Will.

14:29.930 --> 14:32.421
Uh, I hope this visit
to our sanctum

14:32.470 --> 14:34.438
will prove more fruitful.

14:34.470 --> 14:36.961
Can we ask Mrs. Florrick
why she chose this venue

14:37.010 --> 14:39.262
for her complaint and
not a court subpoena?

14:39.310 --> 14:40.675
We can.

14:40.710 --> 14:41.904
Mrs. Florrick?

14:41.940 --> 14:45.103
Mr. Gardner has already shown
his true stripes to this board.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.209
(laughs)
And we thought
you would be best

14:47.250 --> 14:49.218
to discern a pattern
of abuse here.

14:49.250 --> 14:51.138
Oh, go to hell.
She's using Will's disbarment...

14:51.190 --> 14:53.408
Excuse me, sir.
I haven't called on you yet.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.984
WILL:
Mrs. Florrick

14:55.020 --> 14:56.157
has already admitted
she's hoping

14:56.190 --> 14:57.953
this board will be biased
against my firm.

14:57.990 --> 14:59.127
ALICIA:
Not your firm.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.650
You.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.459
We would only ask that
this complaint be quashed until

15:06.500 --> 15:07.432
the court's jurisdiction
is satisfied.

15:07.470 --> 15:10.166
We are in active litigation
at this moment,

15:10.210 --> 15:11.336
Mr. Chairman...

15:11.370 --> 15:12.507
After poaching my case.
No.

15:12.540 --> 15:13.700
We did not approach the client.

15:13.740 --> 15:16.538
She approached us, disappointed
with your representation.

15:16.580 --> 15:21.040
Mr. Chairman, we need
all these case files so that

15:21.080 --> 15:23.640
we can properly represent
the client's interests, and

15:23.690 --> 15:26.341
Mr. Gardner and Ms. Lockhart
are actively delaying...

15:26.390 --> 15:27.550
What, I don't rate?

15:27.590 --> 15:29.558
And Mr. Lee are
actively delaying

15:29.590 --> 15:31.251
the delivery of these files

15:31.290 --> 15:33.349
in an attempt to
win the client back.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.492
Is this true, Will?

15:34.530 --> 15:37.192
No. We are carefully culling
our records for these files.

15:37.230 --> 15:38.595
ALICIA:
There's no need to cull.

15:38.630 --> 15:40.188
This isn't the '705.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.403
Lockhart/Gardner's IT department
keeps a careful,

15:43.440 --> 15:45.169
ongoing record
of all its cases.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.461
All you have to do

15:46.510 --> 15:48.375
is type in this code
and push "return."

15:48.410 --> 15:49.570
How do you know that?

15:49.610 --> 15:51.498
I worked there.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.145
Will... you were suspended

15:56.180 --> 15:58.114
because of this kind
of nonsense.

15:58.150 --> 16:00.584
Get her the files,
or be sanctioned.

16:00.620 --> 16:03.180
DEERFIELD:
Diane?

16:03.230 --> 16:05.755
Oh, we're handling it, Lionel.
Don't worry.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.054
Oh, no, no. I just
wanted to say,

16:08.100 --> 16:09.453
I told Florrick's people that

16:09.500 --> 16:11.695
you would make a far better
justice than Blair Koturbash.

16:11.730 --> 16:14.039
I'm sorry?

16:14.070 --> 16:16.368
The governor's people called
to vet Koturbash,

16:16.400 --> 16:19.005
and I said they were crazy
not to nominate you

16:19.040 --> 16:20.632
for the Supreme Court seat.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.205
But I'm _sure _
everything Will be fine.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.418
(elevator bell dings)

16:28.450 --> 16:33.058
Well, how long
until the meeting is over?

16:33.090 --> 16:35.058
Well, please tell Mr. Gold
to call.

16:35.090 --> 16:36.717
KaHnda?

16:36.760 --> 16:38.751
I need help.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.796
Peter Florrick is vetting
another candidate

16:42.830 --> 16:45.390
for the Supreme Court.

16:45.430 --> 16:47.239
It may just
be for show.

16:47.270 --> 16:50.569
Peter may want it to
look like a fair process.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.033
Or it... it could be
because of events here.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.105
I'll find out.
Good, thanks.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.142
Bill me personally.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.414
Bad day?

17:11.160 --> 17:13.697
Found your defect
for your gun case.

17:13.730 --> 17:16.255
(laughs)

17:16.300 --> 17:18.097
(sighs)
You want me
to come back?

17:18.130 --> 17:19.722
No, it's...

17:19.770 --> 17:22.466
It's just not
my case anymore.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.139
It's too bad. It's winnable.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.138
(phone ringing)

17:27.180 --> 17:28.738
ALICIA:
Hello?

17:28.780 --> 17:31.840
Hello, Alicia.
It's Gina... at work.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.609
I mean, your old work.

17:33.650 --> 17:34.810
Oh. Hi, Gina. How are you?

17:34.850 --> 17:36.169
Good.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.609
Uh, actually, not so good.

17:38.650 --> 17:41.289
They've stopped paying
for teleconferencing from home,

17:41.320 --> 17:42.582
and I have child-care problems.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.178
Oh.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.822
I'm so sorry.
I would have called,

17:45.860 --> 17:47.589
but, uh, we're not hiring
assistants

17:47.630 --> 17:49.689
right now.
We're still looking

17:49.730 --> 17:50.867
for office space.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.629
What if I gave you something

17:52.670 --> 17:54.558
that would help
win your gun case?

17:54.600 --> 17:56.659
What if? What is it?

17:56.700 --> 17:58.759
No. I need my same salary,

17:58.810 --> 18:01.870
two days at home,
one year guaranteed.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.708
ALICIA:
Uh, Carey,

18:04.750 --> 18:06.570
do you have a minute?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.484
Everything all right?
Yeah.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.647
Um, just, what did Grace want?

18:12.690 --> 18:15.614
Oh, she just wanted to know if
I was converted in Campus Faith,

18:15.660 --> 18:17.651
or if I always
was a Christian.

18:17.690 --> 18:19.681
Okay, here's the thing.

18:19.730 --> 18:22.392
I don't want my family life
overlapping

18:22.430 --> 18:26.127
with my work life,
so, if you don't mind,

18:26.170 --> 18:28.468
the next time Grace wants
to talk to you,

18:28.500 --> 18:30.161
just tell her you're busy?

18:30.210 --> 18:31.609
It's completely innocent,

18:31.640 --> 18:33.232
Alicia.
I know.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.907
I just don't want my daughter
distracted.

18:34.940 --> 18:36.908
I want her to do her homework.

18:36.940 --> 18:38.908
Okay. Sorry.
No, no.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.770
Everything's fine.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.276
(Grace laughs)

18:42.320 --> 18:45.847
Um, I have to go
and get us a ballistics expert.

18:45.890 --> 18:49.348
I'll be back in an hour.

18:49.390 --> 18:50.880
Grace?

18:50.930 --> 18:52.818
Bye.
See ya.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.391
I wasn't doing anything.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.307
I know, I just wanted the
pleasure of your company.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.733
Alicia's going to want us
to join Wallis & Frey.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.941
I know.
They want a portion
of our Chumhum fee.

19:10.980 --> 19:12.607
We need to outvote Alicia.

19:12.650 --> 19:14.618
Or find new office space.

19:14.650 --> 19:16.709
This is all about us
invading her home.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.684
(sighs)

19:18.720 --> 19:22.281
Find something, and we won't
need to outvote her.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.856
CARY:
Hello?

19:23.890 --> 19:25.585
Mm. Hi.

19:25.630 --> 19:28.929
Um, I have a meeting
with Alicia at 3:00, but I think

19:28.960 --> 19:30.325
she's a little late.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.497
Actually, she had
a meeting to go to.

19:32.530 --> 19:33.690
I'm her partner,
Cary Agos.

19:33.740 --> 19:34.729
May I help you?

19:34.770 --> 19:36.829
I'm the chair of the governor's
ethics commission.

19:36.870 --> 19:40.829
(whispering):
Um, I just had a few questions.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.836
(chatter and laughter)
Sure.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.678
Oh.

19:45.710 --> 19:47.644
And you're
making soup?
(laughs)

19:47.680 --> 19:50.319
No. I just never know
when I might feel sick.

19:50.350 --> 19:53.285
So you've acquired
Chumhum as a client?

19:53.320 --> 19:54.309
That's a great account.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.554
Oh, it is.

19:55.590 --> 19:58.582
It's just their Midwestern
business, but it's pretty big.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.420
(groans)

20:02.460 --> 20:03.666
But it didn't look like

20:03.700 --> 20:05.725
the account was always
gonna go your way?

20:05.770 --> 20:07.692
Well, we-we had a battle
with Lockhart/Gardner,

20:07.740 --> 20:08.968
our old firm, over it.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.935
And Peter Florrick heard about
your troubles With the account?

20:11.970 --> 20:15.508
Well, he was here, so,
yeah, I guess he did.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.509
He was here, at the apartment,
when you heard

20:18.550 --> 20:20.245
about losing Chumhum?

20:20.280 --> 20:21.611
Yes. Why?

20:21.650 --> 20:23.982
No reason. _
So you were surprised

20:24.020 --> 20:27.683
when Governor Florrick made a
speech about Internet taxation?

20:27.720 --> 20:30.826
I mean, that-that speech really
turned the tides for you.

20:30.860 --> 20:34.523
You work for Mr. Florrick?

20:34.560 --> 20:35.788
Governor Florrick? Yes.

20:35.830 --> 20:38.469
I mean, after that speech, the
account really came your way...

20:38.500 --> 20:41.765
Actually, why don't we wait
for Alicia to return?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.836
Maybe she should help
answer these questions.

20:43.870 --> 20:46.839
(inhales deeply)

20:47.880 --> 20:49.836
Excuse me.

20:51.710 --> 20:54.873
Just so I understand,
Mrs. Florrick.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.842
You took the case
from Diarli\le Lockhart?
o.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.610
The client came to _me
of her own free Will.

20:59.650 --> 21:00.787
I didn't take her.

21:00.820 --> 21:01.855
I was hired by Lockhart/Gardner.
I know.

21:01.890 --> 21:03.482
And we would like
to hire you, too.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.282
We'll pay your usual fee,

21:05.330 --> 21:08.652
and ask nothing more
than your good judgment.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.894
Ah, my good judgment.

21:09.930 --> 21:12.524
Mr. McVeigh, I know
you're married to Diane

21:12.570 --> 21:15.596
and I don't want to cause
any problems for you,

21:15.640 --> 21:17.039
but there is
a defective gun out there,

21:17.070 --> 21:19.300
and I know that means
more to you than anything.

21:19.340 --> 21:20.978
You know what means
more to me than anything?

21:21.010 --> 21:22.830
Not being used.
I'm not using you.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.542
All I am asking you to do is...

21:25.580 --> 21:27.741
tell the truth
maw%.
You're not after the truth.

21:27.780 --> 21:31.045
Forget our issues
With Lockhart/Gardner.

21:31.090 --> 21:34.480
_ Mr_s. Sorrentino
is an innocent woman

21:34.520 --> 21:36.852
Who deserves justice;
that's the truth.

21:39.060 --> 21:41.096
McVEIGH:
What do you need me to do?

21:41.130 --> 21:42.791
ALICIA:
Anything. Start
from scratch.

21:42.830 --> 21:43.694
Dig deeper.

21:43.730 --> 21:45.368
There has to be
something you missed.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.766
McVEIGH:
I don't miss things,
Mrs. Florrick.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.994
*

22:11.890 --> 22:14.927
He had a lot of guns.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.690
He's a ballistics expert.

22:17.730 --> 22:20.460
They were...
really elaborate.

22:20.500 --> 22:23.060
It's all right for him
to have them, but...

22:23.100 --> 22:25.000
guns are dangerous.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.873
I want to fire one sometime.

22:29.910 --> 22:32.640
No. I don't think
that's a good idea.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.375
Have you ever fired one?

22:34.420 --> 22:35.569
No.

22:36.950 --> 22:38.941
I want to sometime.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.386
They sent the files--

22:46.430 --> 22:47.988
I can't believe it.
Don't.

22:48.030 --> 22:49.054
They redacted them.

22:49.100 --> 22:50.522
You're kidding.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.959
CAREY: Nope.
They're toying with you.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.375
("Captain Sunshine"
by Lucy Schwartz playing)

23:09.820 --> 23:11.811
*

23:16.960 --> 23:18.951
I want a baby.

23:18.990 --> 23:20.855
You...

23:20.900 --> 23:21.798
What?

23:21.830 --> 23:23.923
(laughs): Don't worry,
I don't want you.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.528
I just want your baby.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.095
You don't have to be the dad.
I don't want you

23:28.140 --> 23:30.700
to stick around.
Isabel, I've
known you three days.

23:30.740 --> 23:31.832
Right.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.428
This isn't about commitment

23:33.480 --> 23:35.004
or wanting to live with you.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.871
I want you to get me pregnant

23:36.910 --> 23:38.946
and... go away.
I got to go to work.

23:38.980 --> 23:40.811
So, that's a no?

23:40.850 --> 23:44.013
It's a "I don't know what the
hell you're talking about,

23:44.050 --> 23:47.178
but I want to return to
people Who make sense."

23:47.220 --> 23:50.018
(laughs)

23:50.060 --> 23:52.119
You really think
I wanted a baby?
I did.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.128
Oh... psyche.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.957
(Isabel laughs)

23:56.000 --> 23:57.991
Come on,
get me pregnant, Will.

23:58.030 --> 23:59.964
Bye, crazy lady.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.069
Mmm.

24:01.100 --> 24:05.104
But I need your baby
inside me, Will.

24:07.140 --> 24:11.645
McVEIGH:
I've been asked to testify
in the Sorrentino gun case.

24:14.150 --> 24:16.869
You've been asked?

24:16.920 --> 24:18.012
By whom?

24:18.050 --> 24:19.119
Alicia Florrick.

24:27.160 --> 24:31.096
And you're... asking me
if this is all right?

24:31.130 --> 24:33.223
No. We said When we got married

24:33.270 --> 24:36.194
that we wouldn't have veto power
over each other's cases.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.561
So you're just informing me?
Yes.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.498
This was my case.

24:40.540 --> 24:43.941
I know. And it's Winnable.
Winnable for Alicia.

24:43.980 --> 24:46.642
No, Winnable
for Heather Sorrentino.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.739
That's not fair.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.008
How is that not fair?

24:53.050 --> 24:54.756
Well, you've already

24:54.790 --> 24:57.008
made up your mind,
so go, go do it.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.982
The gun is defective--
it should be taken

24:59.030 --> 25:01.191
off the street.
Yep.

25:01.230 --> 25:03.562
Go. Be a hero.

25:09.170 --> 25:11.138
McVEIGH:
They're called

25:11.170 --> 25:14.230
junk guns-- that's the term
that law enforcement uses

25:14.280 --> 25:16.009
for cheaply made handguns.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.838
You see a lot of them,
because they're easy to buy.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.177
Did you examine the Lobera .38

25:20.210 --> 25:22.246
that killed Tim Sorrentino?
Yes. I compared it

25:22.280 --> 25:24.282
to five separate Loberas
that I bought

25:24.320 --> 25:26.117
from five different stores.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.050
Why?
To ensure that my test
sample was random.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.614
And what did you find?

25:29.660 --> 25:32.151
The trigger mechanism
had a faulty spring,

25:32.190 --> 25:33.225
and the resistance

25:33.260 --> 25:36.058
was 75% less than normal.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.829
So with this kind
of hair trigger,

25:37.870 --> 25:40.122
could a gun discharge
if it hit the ground?

25:40.170 --> 25:41.797
I'd be surprised
if it didn't.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.865
ALICIA:
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.233
(sighs)
Um...

25:48.280 --> 25:50.236
I don't know much about guns,

25:50.280 --> 25:51.975
but, um, my daddy

25:52.010 --> 25:54.274
does hunt a little bit,
and he told me that there

25:54.320 --> 25:56.242
are other factors
that can contribute

25:56.280 --> 25:57.884
to a firearm's
performance.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.185
Um, such as
weather, right?
Certainly.

26:01.220 --> 26:04.257
Were you aware that on June 18,
the day Mr. Sorrentino died,

26:04.290 --> 26:06.724
that Chicago was
experiencing a heat wave

26:06.760 --> 26:09.092
and the temperature
was 98 degrees?

26:09.130 --> 26:10.597
McVEIGH:
No.

26:10.630 --> 26:12.359
CROZIER:
How about moisture...

26:12.400 --> 26:15.039
like... from a car wash,

26:15.070 --> 26:19.029
_ could that affect
a firearm's performance?

26:19.070 --> 26:20.935
It could.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.778
CROZIER:
So if I kept a gun locked in
a drawer in a damp environment

26:23.810 --> 26:25.243
in 98-degree heat,

26:25.280 --> 26:27.771
could that cause
a hair trigger?

26:28.820 --> 26:30.310
It could.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.179
(indistinct conversation nearby)

26:40.090 --> 26:43.150
You, uh, asked me
to look into the vetting process

26:43.200 --> 26:44.360
of the governor-elect.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.823
It's real?

26:46.870 --> 26:48.235
Yeah.

26:48.270 --> 26:50.738
They're, um, they're vetting
Blair Koturbash,

26:50.770 --> 26:53.000
Thomas Veracruz
and Janet Sasaki.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.598
I'm out?

26:56.940 --> 26:58.908
I... I can't say that.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.008
Thank you.

27:04.050 --> 27:06.086
That's... that's What I thought.

27:08.820 --> 27:10.287
(door creaks open)

27:11.330 --> 27:14.094
(inhaling deeply)

27:18.100 --> 27:20.739
(door closes)

27:20.770 --> 27:23.659
(sobbing)

27:29.140 --> 27:31.301
And here we are again.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.908
But, uh, no
Mrs. Florrick?

27:32.950 --> 27:35.111
She's in court, Your Honor,
but I'm Cary Agos,

27:35.150 --> 27:37.015
and I'm here
to argue...
Lionel is fine.

27:37.050 --> 27:39.189
And what seems to be
the problem now?

27:39.220 --> 27:40.858
This is What Mr. Gardner

27:40.890 --> 27:43.188
and Ms. Lockhart
have sent us.

27:43.220 --> 27:45.222
Uh, Will...

27:45.260 --> 27:46.727
Will...
We sent

27:46.760 --> 27:47.954
every file we're legally

27:48.000 --> 27:50.218
required to...
You're trying to bleed us
out of this case.

27:50.260 --> 27:51.761
That is not true.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.132
Florrick and Associates...
Florrick-Agos.

27:54.170 --> 27:56.092
is legally entitled
to client files.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.734
They are not legally entitled
to work product.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.135
And the redactions
are your work product?

28:00.170 --> 28:02.274
Yes. Our personal notes,
our observations,

28:02.310 --> 28:04.107
our-our legal stratagems.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.378
Not your legal
stratagems,

28:05.410 --> 28:07.105
our legal stratagems from when

28:07.150 --> 28:08.947
we worked for you.
Yes, When you were

28:08.980 --> 28:10.447
a Lockhart/Gardner
employee-- in other words,

28:10.480 --> 28:11.913
our work product.
Your Honor,

28:11.950 --> 28:13.486
we'd like to call
a hostile Witness

28:13.520 --> 28:15.283
to prove that this isn't true.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.311
CARY:
I mean, Mr. Chairman.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.248
Miss Sharma,

28:19.290 --> 28:20.996
you conducted
investigative work

28:21.030 --> 28:24.796
on Heather Sorrentino's suit
against Decatur Firearms?
Yes.

28:24.830 --> 28:26.263
What questions
did you ask them?

28:26.300 --> 28:28.734
I was trying to determine
if anyone had prior knowledge

28:28.770 --> 28:31.068
of the flaws in the Lobera .38.
And what

28:31.110 --> 28:33.237
did you conclude?
Objection.
He's fishing

28:33.270 --> 28:35.374
for content for
_ his lawsuit.
Keep it on pomt, Mr. Agos.

28:35.410 --> 28:37.105
Did you take notes
during these interviews?

28:37.140 --> 28:39.074
I did.
What did you do
With these notes?

28:39.110 --> 28:41.419
I shared them
With Ms. Lockhart, and then I

28:41.450 --> 28:44.840
put them away in the files.
Lionel, clearly
these notes are part

28:44.890 --> 28:46.289
of the client files,
but they have been redacted.

28:47.150 --> 28:49.914
Kalinda, did you
write anything else

28:49.960 --> 28:51.325
in your notes besides
the employees' answers?

28:51.360 --> 28:54.124
I did. Comments
and observations.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.025
Such as?

28:56.060 --> 28:58.324
I wanted to look into one
of the lab employees

28:58.370 --> 29:00.167
I suspected was
an alcoholic.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.134
So you didn't just record
objective facts--

29:02.170 --> 29:05.264
you memorialized
subjective opinion, follow-ups,

29:05.310 --> 29:06.868
strategies.
Yes.

29:06.910 --> 29:09.174
Uh, hello? Hello?

29:09.210 --> 29:10.848
May I help you?
Hi.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.269
Uh, Robyn Burdine, the
Florrick-Agos investigator.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.012
Hi.

29:17.050 --> 29:18.244
Hi.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.780
I just have a
quick follow-up.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.185
Miss Sharma,
What is this?

29:24.060 --> 29:27.257
It's, um, it's an invoice
to Heather Sorrentino

29:27.290 --> 29:29.850
for my services.
Your investigative services

29:29.900 --> 29:32.368
_ in connection
With the Decatur Firearms case.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.563
Yes.
But this is not
a Lockhart/Gardner invoice.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.932
This has been issued
by you personally.

29:37.970 --> 29:40.359
Is that because you are
an independent contractor

29:40.410 --> 29:41.479
engaged by
Lockhart/Gardner,

29:41.510 --> 29:43.432
and technically
not an employee

29:43.480 --> 29:45.505
of the firm?
Yes.

29:45.550 --> 29:48.041
Mr. Chairman, this invoice
proves that Kalinda Sharma

29:48.080 --> 29:49.377
was engaged directly
by the client,

29:49.420 --> 29:50.887
and therefore her notes

29:50.920 --> 29:53.480
are our client property.

29:55.960 --> 29:59.225
ROBYN:
At least I don't see any rats.
I think we got the real files.

29:59.260 --> 30:00.522
No redactions.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.050
Here, either.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.328
(laughter)

30:03.360 --> 30:04.463
Good job, you two.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.263
Mom, there's someone
at the door.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.329
Oh, Mr. McVeigh, hello.

30:10.370 --> 30:11.507
You got a minute?

30:11.540 --> 30:12.859
Yes. Um, What
can I help you With?

30:12.910 --> 30:15.037
My examination of the .38.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.900
Oh, that's okay.
We have other evidence.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.339
When I first examined
the firing mechanism,

30:18.380 --> 30:20.371
it was easy to access,

30:20.410 --> 30:22.571
there was no need
to take it apart.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.009
But I was thinking about
the environmental conditions

30:25.050 --> 30:26.312
mentioned in
court, so...

30:26.350 --> 30:28.489
this time I wanted to be sure.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.511
Sure of What?

30:32.160 --> 30:34.094
These are...?

30:34.130 --> 30:36.155
What you need to Win.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.395
GENEVA:
That's interesting,

30:38.430 --> 30:40.068
because When
I hear someone yell,

30:40.100 --> 30:41.192
"Just give him the money,"

30:41.240 --> 30:42.935
I assume they're
conducting a robbery.

30:42.970 --> 30:44.528
OLIVIA:
Objection. Argumentative.

30:44.570 --> 30:46.936
Mr. Rolfe already explained
that he was just trying

30:46.970 --> 30:49.131
to get the victim
out of there alive.
Withdrawn.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.579
(whispering inaudibly)

30:50.610 --> 30:54.114
Your Honor... I would like
to add one more witness.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.111
The gun had bad pins.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.139
(quietly):
In What way?

30:59.190 --> 31:00.543
In What way were they bad?

31:00.590 --> 31:04.026
This is a standard
cocking cam pivot pin.

31:04.060 --> 31:07.029
It's kind of a link between
the trigger and the hammer.

31:07.060 --> 31:09.199
This is the pin that was
in Tim Sorrentino's gun.

31:09.230 --> 31:11.164
It was defective.
That's What caused

31:11.200 --> 31:12.269
the hair trigger.
In your opinion...

31:12.300 --> 31:13.267
And in your opinion,

31:13.300 --> 31:15.063
What caused
this defect?

31:15.100 --> 31:17.068
McVEIGH:
The gun was new, so...

31:17.100 --> 31:18.931
owner misuse wasn't
the problem.

31:18.970 --> 31:21.029
That leaves a flaw
in manufacturing.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.173
So... it
was already

31:23.210 --> 31:26.646
damaged before it was installed
into Tim Sorrentino's gun,

31:26.680 --> 31:29.069
and a gun like this
could discharge

31:29.120 --> 31:30.348
if it hit the ground?

31:30.380 --> 31:32.041
Yes, definitely.
So...

31:32.090 --> 31:33.341
a murder charge
against my client

31:33.390 --> 31:35.381
would clearly be
unwarranted.
Objection.

31:35.420 --> 31:38.127
Your Honor, beyond the scope,
beyond the sense.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.650
I'll Withdraw...

31:39.690 --> 31:41.897
and rest my case.

31:42.330 --> 31:43.524
Thank you.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.562
All in a day's work.

31:50.470 --> 31:53.439
Nice job you did there, Cary,
getting them that Witness.

31:53.470 --> 31:55.335
Having an innocent
man always helps.

31:55.380 --> 31:56.631
_ We'll reduce
to involuntary manslaughter.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.477
That's the best I can do.

31:58.510 --> 32:01.377
This isn't about having
a plea bargain, Geneva.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.216
This is about clearing

32:02.250 --> 32:03.512
Mr. Rolfe of
all charges.
Five years.

32:03.550 --> 32:04.482
With good time credit,

32:04.520 --> 32:05.646
you'll be out in three.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.181
You have ten minutes to decide.

32:09.590 --> 32:11.455
All right,
it's not what we'd hoped for,

32:11.490 --> 32:13.526
but we can still beat this
in court.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.323
Take it.
What?!

32:15.360 --> 32:18.420
Wait. The ASA is just
playing a game of chicken.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.529
And she won.
Take it, Adam.

32:20.570 --> 32:23.562
You don't take five years,
you're likely facing 20.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.205
Take it.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.537
He took the deal?

32:27.570 --> 32:29.174
He didn't want
to risk 20 years.

32:29.210 --> 32:30.609
ALICIA:
Well, we have to
find a new strategy,

32:30.640 --> 32:31.538
because his guilty plea

32:31.580 --> 32:33.502
just gave Nancy Crozier
her criminal act.

32:33.550 --> 32:37.179
Mom? I'm going back
to my room to study. See?

32:37.220 --> 32:39.188
Good. Thanks.

32:39.220 --> 32:41.359
(overlapping chatter)

32:43.590 --> 32:45.558
I'm sorry I
missed you before.

32:45.590 --> 32:51.267
Yes, but it seems you got
your answers from Cary instead.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.030
Yes, he mentioned
that Peter was here

32:54.070 --> 32:56.561
When you discovered
the Chumhum account

32:56.600 --> 32:58.500
was in trouble.
Peter did not
know that.

32:58.540 --> 32:59.529
But he was here?

32:59.570 --> 33:02.505
Yes. Having sex With me.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.269
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

33:05.310 --> 33:08.473
52?, _::; ’1

33:09.680 --> 33:11.739
Here's what I'm wondering,
Ms. Garbanza.

33:11.790 --> 33:15.157
Who are you really working for?

33:15.190 --> 33:17.215
The governor...
of course.

33:17.260 --> 33:19.626
So, that's Why you hid the fact

33:19.660 --> 33:21.594
that you were really here
to snoop around

33:21.630 --> 33:25.020
about Peter's
Internet taxation speech?

33:25.070 --> 33:27.061
(sighs)

33:29.670 --> 33:31.661
(groans)

33:37.180 --> 33:39.148
I, uh...

33:39.180 --> 33:41.148
I had a tip.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.273
Someone called my
office anonymously,

33:43.320 --> 33:45.208
saying that Peter
used his bully pulpit

33:45.250 --> 33:46.547
to help you
sign Chumhum.

33:46.590 --> 33:49.479
I wanted to investigate
in order to protect Peter.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.488
You mean Governor Florrick?

33:51.530 --> 33:53.486
Yes, of course.

33:53.530 --> 33:55.498
Governor Florrick.

33:55.530 --> 33:58.192
And how does this investigation
protect him?

33:58.230 --> 34:00.164
When I write a report

34:00.200 --> 34:03.397
clearing you and Governor
Florrick of wrongdoing,

34:03.440 --> 34:05.601
it Will inoculate you
against future investigation.

34:08.540 --> 34:12.647
You're right not
to trust me, Alicia.

34:12.680 --> 34:17.140
My job is both friendly
and antagonistic.

34:19.150 --> 34:21.812
But I'd like to tell you
Where your story is weak.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.621
Go for it.

34:26.660 --> 34:31.097
You should warn Cary
about talking to outsiders.

34:31.130 --> 34:33.769
You should ask the governor
not to intervene

34:33.800 --> 34:35.631
in your business
again.
He doesn't.

34:35.670 --> 34:39.128
He does. When it comes
to his family, he does.

34:39.170 --> 34:41.604
And that's What
Will eventually...

34:41.640 --> 34:43.801
(sighs)

34:43.840 --> 34:45.808
...hurt him.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.148
(groans)

34:48.180 --> 34:50.239
Okay.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.612
I need to go.

34:52.650 --> 34:54.584
Can I get you anything?

34:54.620 --> 34:56.611
The second
trimester.

35:00.560 --> 35:04.462
Well, we could put the plant
manager on the stand.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.525
He must have known
about the defective pins.

35:06.570 --> 35:07.764
He'll just
denyit

35:07.800 --> 35:10.735
Then we need to try
another PLCAA exception.

35:10.770 --> 35:11.759
Fine. Which one?

35:11.810 --> 35:13.630
Breach of warranty?

35:13.670 --> 35:15.672
It's a stretch.

35:15.710 --> 35:16.904
A big one.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.544
McVeigh gave us the defect.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.400
We need to demonstrate
how it violated

35:20.450 --> 35:21.872
the warranty.
CAREY:
And no one's

35:21.920 --> 35:23.512
ever tried this before?

35:23.550 --> 35:24.744
No one's ever
had Judge Davies.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.518
Look, he wants
to rule for us.

35:25.550 --> 35:26.915
We need to give
him something.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.451
Okay, warranty violation.

35:28.490 --> 35:29.684
Only problem?

35:29.720 --> 35:32.359
Lockhart/Gardner has
the manufacturer's

35:32.390 --> 35:33.527
warranty documents.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.755
Of course they do.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.222
(siren wailing)

35:37.260 --> 35:38.659
You're wearing me out.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.793
(laughing)

35:40.830 --> 35:42.263
What ifI did want a kid?

35:42.300 --> 35:43.528
What if you What?

35:43.570 --> 35:44.867
Are we joking now or What?

35:44.910 --> 35:48.732
We're joking...
and not joking.

35:52.850 --> 35:55.717
I got to go.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.951
Hey.

36:04.990 --> 36:07.424
Oh, we were about
to start Without you.

36:07.460 --> 36:08.597
I'm here.

36:08.630 --> 36:10.518
Rock and roll.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.699
DEERFIELD:
Florrick-Agos is in the

36:12.730 --> 36:15.790
unfortunate position of coming
to you hat in hand asking for

36:15.840 --> 36:18.559
relevant documents
piecemeal.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.737
As of today, that ends.

36:20.770 --> 36:22.806
Mr. Chairman,
we ask for sanctions.

36:22.840 --> 36:23.829
And the chair agrees.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.747
Every day that files are kept
from Florrick-Agos,

36:26.780 --> 36:28.771
a fine of $20,000
Will be applied.
That...

36:28.820 --> 36:30.344
That won't be necessary.

36:30.380 --> 36:31.916
We'll turn over everything
immediately.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.781
Once we're properly compensated

36:34.820 --> 36:36.310
for our time and effort.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.885
Your what?

36:38.930 --> 36:41.797
Well, here's a copy of our
standard retainer agreement.

36:41.830 --> 36:45.493
Mrs. Sorrentino hired _us
on a contingency basis.

36:45.530 --> 36:47.395
And that means we'd only
get paid if she won.

36:47.430 --> 36:49.591
Since we're no longer
the attorneys of record,

36:49.640 --> 36:51.335
we're entitled
to compensation

36:51.370 --> 36:53.258
for our work
product to date.

36:53.310 --> 36:56.404
At standard rates,
that comes to... $145,000.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.273
We're on a contingency basis,
and our client

36:59.310 --> 37:00.641
doesn't have
that kind of money.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.375
WILL:
Hmm. Well,

37:02.420 --> 37:04.388
once someone cuts us a check

37:04.420 --> 37:06.581
for the 145 Gs,
you'll get your files.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.386
CROZIER:
Objection!

37:13.430 --> 37:15.694
Your Honor has already
ruled. The accused,

37:15.730 --> 37:17.391
Mr. Rolfe,
was sentenced yesterday

37:17.430 --> 37:19.398
to involuntary manslaughter.

37:19.430 --> 37:20.829
A crime.

37:20.870 --> 37:21.734
Thus, the plaintiff
cannotsue,

37:21.770 --> 37:24.261
as the gun was fired
during a criminal act.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.709
Which is why we would like

37:25.740 --> 37:27.435
to amend ou_r suit
from product liability

37:27.470 --> 37:29.335
to breach
of warranty.
I'm sorry.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.302
Mrs. Florrick is just
obviously playing a game

37:31.350 --> 37:32.374
of musical
PLCAA exceptions.

37:32.410 --> 37:34.469
Your Honor, we have enough
evidence to demonstrate...

37:34.520 --> 37:35.669
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have

37:35.720 --> 37:37.369
to stop you right there,
Mrs. Florrick.

37:37.420 --> 37:38.614
You've been replaced

37:38.650 --> 37:40.379
as plaintiff's
counsel.
I've been...?

37:44.090 --> 37:46.558
Heather?

37:46.590 --> 37:47.921
They have all
the files, Alicia.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.928
I just want to Win,
that's all.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.518
I'm sorry.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.595
Permission to be seated,
Your Honor?

37:53.630 --> 37:55.393
Permission granted.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.635
Well, here we are,

37:57.670 --> 37:59.763
exactly where we were
two days ago.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.835
Congratulations.
Mrs. Florrick?

38:02.880 --> 38:04.700
Don't want you to forget this.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.809
Have a nice day.

38:12.350 --> 38:14.989
Your Honor, I would like
to amend the suit

38:15.020 --> 38:18.683
from product liability
to breach of warranty.

38:23.830 --> 38:26.890
(phone rings)
WOMAN:
Lockhart/Gardner.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.890
Oh, yeah, she is.
One second.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.931
Peter Florrick for you.

38:34.510 --> 38:36.501
Okay.

38:41.650 --> 38:43.641
Hello?

38:44.920 --> 38:47.013
Hello, Governor.

38:53.030 --> 38:55.089
Yes, I understand.

38:55.130 --> 39:00.022
I, uh, appreciate the honor
of even being considered.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.468
Yes, that would be great.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.502
I'll have my assistant call.

39:06.740 --> 39:09.038
Yes, all the best
to you, too, Peter.

39:18.550 --> 39:20.745
So, you're going
running now?
Yeah.

39:20.790 --> 39:22.018
I've got this energy.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.449
I don't know where it's coming
from, but I'm going to ride it.

39:24.490 --> 39:26.458
What's up?

39:26.490 --> 39:29.152
Nothing. So, we
got Heather back.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.896
We did, didn't we?

39:31.930 --> 39:33.568
It was like old times.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.398
I was angry,
you were calm.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.431
What would you say if I stayed?

39:43.980 --> 39:45.948
Peter screwed you over?

39:45.980 --> 39:48.448
(quietly):
Yes.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.471
(sighs)

39:52.790 --> 39:54.917
It's an odd psychology,
isn't it?

39:54.960 --> 39:57.019
He can hurt his wife
all he wants,

39:57.060 --> 39:59.688
but anyone else try,
and he goes absolutely tribal.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.790
Bill and Hillary on steroids.

40:05.100 --> 40:09.036
I'm taking this firm
to the top, Diane.

40:09.070 --> 40:10.560
We're gonna rip through
our opponents.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.067
(zippering)
No votes.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.066
Just decide and go.

40:14.110 --> 40:16.078
And it won't be polite anymore.

40:16.110 --> 40:18.169
Anyone in our way,
we kick their ass,

40:18.210 --> 40:19.643
fire them or buy them out.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.671
Can you handle that?

40:21.720 --> 40:23.540
I'm through being polite.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.047
Good.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.785
Then welcome aboard.

40:30.260 --> 40:32.148
(loud, overlapping chatter)

40:32.190 --> 40:34.727
ANTHONY:
I don't think we should get
in business with these people.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.728
We just got out from
under all of this.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.159
It's ridiculous.
Why are we even...?

40:38.200 --> 40:39.167
Okay. Ok...

40:39.200 --> 40:41.065
Okay, shh. Hey.

40:41.100 --> 40:42.636
We need to decide.

40:42.670 --> 40:44.638
We look like idiots
to them.
ANTHONY:
Screw them.

40:44.670 --> 40:46.467
They're tax attorneys.
ROBYN:
They're tax attorneys

40:46.510 --> 40:48.239
Who are offering us
office space.

40:48.270 --> 40:49.703
Okay, I'm gonna speak
for myself.

40:49.740 --> 40:51.173
I was impressed
With their offer.

40:51.210 --> 40:53.201
Wallis & Frey will not touch

40:53.250 --> 40:54.911
the first three years
of Chumhum money.

40:54.950 --> 40:56.076
That is all ours.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.644
That's a good deal.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.739
Yes, but we'll
share voting rights.

40:59.790 --> 41:00.882
Our ten partners

41:00.920 --> 41:02.751
With their
ten partners.

41:02.790 --> 41:04.781
Do we really
want that?
We want to do something.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.229
Look, we need
to get out of here.

41:06.260 --> 41:07.727
This isn't just about me.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.057
(quietly):
Zach, get your sister

41:09.100 --> 41:10.658
out of the kitchen... now.

41:10.700 --> 41:13.066
Look, Alicia, if this is just
about your apartment...

41:13.100 --> 41:17.264
No!_We are not a real_firm
until we have real offices.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.768
We-we can't meet
With clients here.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.508
And Lockhart/Gardner's
gaining initiative While

41:24.550 --> 41:25.778
we're sitting
around squabbling.
Yeah, but

41:25.810 --> 41:27.846
we shouldn't commit to Wallis
& Frey for their office space.

41:27.880 --> 41:29.973
Or we'll end up top-heaw
like Lockhart/Gardner,

41:30.020 --> 41:31.578
Which is exactly Why
we left them.

41:31.620 --> 41:32.882
Okay, you know What?

41:32.920 --> 41:34.808
We can debate this
till we're blue in the face.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.657
We're all partners here.
Let's just take a vote.
CAREY: No, no.

41:36.690 --> 41:38.248
We have to look at how
the financials line up.

41:38.290 --> 41:39.928
CARY:
Alicia's a name partner.
She's calling for a vote.

41:39.960 --> 41:42.758
So we vote. Okay?

41:42.800 --> 41:46.167
All those in favor for joining
Wallis & Frey, raise your hands.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.259
(overlapping chatter)
Uh...

41:52.070 --> 41:55.631
Yeah, hold on.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.602
(indistinct chatter)

41:57.640 --> 42:00.200
They move fast.
Terms are great.

42:02.250 --> 42:04.070
Yeah, okay...

42:04.120 --> 42:05.712
ROBYN:
What's going on?

42:05.750 --> 42:07.240
They've been bought out.

42:07.290 --> 42:09.281
ROBYN:
Just now? By who?

42:11.260 --> 42:13.228
(laughs)

42:13.260 --> 42:15.694
WILL:
I'm so glad you came on board.

42:15.730 --> 42:19.166
We need tax attorneys,
and we have the infrastructure.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.168
Yeah, Florrick-Agos is a joke.

42:21.200 --> 42:24.237
They'll be out
of business in a month.

42:24.270 --> 42:26.067
Right. Thanks.

42:26.110 --> 42:31.104
* Make way
for Captain Sunshine. *
