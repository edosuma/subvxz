01:34.666 --> 01:39.125
When you've been locked up for 100 hours,
chained, about to be killed,

01:40.250 --> 01:44.833
and you've lost your best friend,
those 100 hours feel like 100 years.

01:49.916 --> 01:51.083
And going outside…

01:51.916 --> 01:54.041
the biggest freedom in the world.

01:55.750 --> 01:57.875
Who cares if soldiers are aiming at you?

01:59.125 --> 02:00.375
Unarmed,

02:00.458 --> 02:01.625
barefoot,

02:02.666 --> 02:05.833
with the sun on your face
and surrounded by silence…

02:07.083 --> 02:08.083
you feel free.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.250
We were sending a message of hope.

02:18.041 --> 02:22.750
Lisbon was there with us,
walking out of the bank,

02:23.958 --> 02:28.041
not at the National Court
or in prison like everyone thought.

02:29.791 --> 02:31.250
Colonel Tamayo!

02:32.458 --> 02:34.041
White flag!

02:37.166 --> 02:40.750
We were telling them that
if we could do that…

02:42.458 --> 02:45.041
we could do anything.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.708
And people started to believe in miracles.

03:55.250 --> 03:58.166
I want your team ready
in one minute, Suárez!

03:58.250 --> 03:59.833
I want a clean operation!

03:59.916 --> 04:02.583
Top priority is those three bitches,
then the hostages.

04:02.666 --> 04:04.875
I want them here!
I don't care how you do it.

04:04.958 --> 04:07.375
You heard him! I want everyone ready.

04:07.958 --> 04:09.541
We can't do that, Tamayo.

04:09.625 --> 04:13.166
She pissed on our faces.
I'm going to wipe her out, no matter what.

04:13.666 --> 04:15.583
-30 seconds!
-They're waving a white flag.

04:15.666 --> 04:18.125
It's been a symbol of peace
since the Punic wars.

04:18.208 --> 04:20.000
Even the Nazis respected it.

04:20.083 --> 04:22.541
Are we going to dismiss it
with the whole world watching?

04:22.625 --> 04:23.833
We're ready!

04:25.541 --> 04:28.958
-We're awaiting your orders.
-I heard you! I'm thinking.

04:33.583 --> 04:36.208
-If we negotiate, we're shitheads.
-No.

04:36.875 --> 04:40.541
This battle is to show who the good
and bad guys are in this war.

04:41.208 --> 04:43.416
If they have a corridor, so do we.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.958
We have to project a friendly image.
No tie.

04:47.041 --> 04:50.000
No jacket. Sleeves rolled up
and no bullet-proof vest.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.583
I'll look like a wimp.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.458
You'll look solid as a rock, Tamayo.
You have to be tough.

04:55.541 --> 04:58.666
You'll give them an ultimatum.
In two minutes, we go in.

04:59.166 --> 05:03.083
We need to cause panic in there.
Let them know they're fucked.

05:03.708 --> 05:05.583
You're giving me a hard-on.

05:06.875 --> 05:10.250
Set up a security corridor
so I can negotiate with them.

05:17.833 --> 05:19.833
-Go get them, Colonel!
-Go, Colonel!

05:20.416 --> 05:21.416
Governor.

05:22.666 --> 05:24.291
What's the army doing here?

05:25.041 --> 05:27.458
This isn't a civil conflict anymore.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.666
Two battalions, assault troops…

05:31.583 --> 05:32.666
They're going in.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.125
It's about time.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.875
That's not good news.

05:37.208 --> 05:39.166
To the police, we're hostages.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.500
To the army, we're collateral damage.

05:47.416 --> 05:48.875
Leaving the security perimeter.

05:48.958 --> 05:50.625
And what's that supposed to mean?

05:51.125 --> 05:54.166
They'll shoot anyone
that's wearing a mask.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.375
Their priority is to kill them,

05:59.875 --> 06:01.250
not rescue us.

06:11.500 --> 06:15.375
The Three Graces have come to put
a friendly face to the heist's name.

06:16.041 --> 06:18.708
We've come out with our faces uncovered
so everyone can see

06:18.791 --> 06:20.875
I'm not at the National Court,

06:20.958 --> 06:23.833
I'm not being interrogated in the tent
and I'm not in prison.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.291
-What the fuck do you want?
-Gandía's injured.

06:27.791 --> 06:29.333
I have to show you something.

06:33.625 --> 06:36.666
Raise your hand,
everyone knows what that means.

06:46.583 --> 06:47.416
Palermo.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.666
Let's see, you slimy snake.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.666
Come on.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.666
There's shrapnel
between his cervical vertebrae.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.000
One wrong move
and he'll never move his arm…

07:04.083 --> 07:06.708
or his lungs, again.
It's called the phrenic nerve.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.375
He urgently needs a neurosurgeon.

07:10.958 --> 07:13.250
One from the army, if you want.
You've got a few.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.833
What are we waiting for?

07:15.750 --> 07:17.541
Let's run to the tent. Now!

07:18.208 --> 07:20.791
They won't shoot us.
We can't go back in the bank.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.083
Of course we can.

07:23.041 --> 07:24.958
Our fellow hostages have no idea.

07:25.750 --> 07:29.666
They'll find out eventually.
It's every man for himself out here.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.750
We have the moral obligation
to do something.

07:33.875 --> 07:36.083
You came in here to be a hero, right?

07:37.166 --> 07:38.541
Well, now's the time.

07:40.916 --> 07:43.416
If I send a doctor in,
I'll have to wait 3 or 4 hours

07:43.500 --> 07:46.375
to get the army in,
which you know I'll do.

07:46.458 --> 07:50.208
That's why you're using
the only card you have. Gandía's injury.

07:50.291 --> 07:53.500
Will you let a man you used be paralyzed?

07:54.458 --> 07:57.750
-Let him go. I'll treat him.
-I get nothing out of that.

07:59.958 --> 08:01.083
You do.

08:01.958 --> 08:03.625
I'll tell you why.

08:03.708 --> 08:06.250
If you don't let him go,
I go in right now.

08:07.208 --> 08:10.708
But if you do, until he tells me
what you're up to in there,

08:10.791 --> 08:12.541
I may as well wait an hour.

08:12.625 --> 08:13.750
It's up to you.

08:15.958 --> 08:18.041
Give us a minute to discuss it.

08:18.833 --> 08:19.791
Of course.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.458
It looks like
I'm getting out before you, Sandokan.

08:29.916 --> 08:31.916
What the fuck are you doing, Bogotá?

08:32.625 --> 08:33.750
At that moment…

08:33.833 --> 08:36.666
We need to release Gandía.
We need that hour.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.750
…Lisbon was the only one
who noticed a tiny detail…

08:39.833 --> 08:40.666
Lisbon?

08:40.750 --> 08:43.625
…that would radically
change the rules of the game.

08:43.708 --> 08:45.625
They don't have the Professor.

08:45.708 --> 08:47.416
-What?
-What?

08:48.625 --> 08:52.166
He gave us an ultimatum
and didn't use his trump card.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.333
If you can checkmate
in one move and don't…

08:55.916 --> 08:58.250
it's because you don't know you can.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.291
Exactly.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.208
Sierra's a lone ranger.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.333
I'm starting to like that nutcase.

09:06.416 --> 09:07.708
Get Gandía ready.

09:14.041 --> 09:16.583
I'm going to fight this piece of shit.

09:18.583 --> 09:19.791
Bogotá, stop!

09:21.041 --> 09:23.666
I may be destroyed,
but I'm still going to beat your ass.

09:23.750 --> 09:27.416
Shit, Bogotá! We're letting him go.
We can't give them scraps.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.500
He'll be carried out feet first.

09:29.583 --> 09:32.000
Hurry up, the minister is waiting
for me with a medal.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.375
Shut up, asshole!

09:33.458 --> 09:35.583
Every time you punch him,
you're punching us.

09:35.666 --> 09:37.750
Your pride's going to fuck us all.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.250
We're already fucked.

09:40.541 --> 09:43.750
This won't change a thing.
Dignity is all we have left.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.583
That's revenge.

09:46.291 --> 09:49.916
-Revenge is a selfish act, you know that.
-It's respect.

09:51.125 --> 09:54.708
Respect for us
and respect for our executed colleague.

09:54.791 --> 09:56.666
-That's what this is.
-I'm with him!

09:56.750 --> 09:58.500
Are you all morons or what?

09:58.583 --> 10:01.625
Lisbon has agreed to release him.
She's buying time.

10:01.708 --> 10:04.083
I don't know Lisbon, but I knew Nairobi.

10:04.583 --> 10:07.416
We're destroying him
before they fuck us over.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.708
Oh, now you're going to kill him?

10:09.791 --> 10:13.000
You're the asshole who says
"Kill him," from behind,

10:13.083 --> 10:15.458
because you couldn't do it
when you had the chance!

10:15.541 --> 10:18.416
You didn't have the balls to do it.
You stopped in your tracks.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.833
So stop being stupid!

10:19.916 --> 10:22.416
You're going to beat each other up, too.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.166
Are you really coming after me?

10:25.083 --> 10:28.083
He's the perpetrator,
he pulled the trigger.

10:28.666 --> 10:31.666
And the mastermind is that bastard.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.750
So stop busting my balls, okay?

10:34.833 --> 10:37.708
Do you want me
to take some flowers to forensics?

10:38.500 --> 10:41.791
Your friend must still be warm.

10:42.458 --> 10:44.500
And even firm.

10:44.583 --> 10:48.500
What would you do if Stockholm were dead?
You hit Arturo when he teased you.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.916
This motherfucker killed one of us.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.375
What's reason enough for you
doesn't apply to us?

10:55.041 --> 10:56.958
Do whatever the fuck you want.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.875
Is it that important to you?

11:03.666 --> 11:04.666
Brother…

11:06.291 --> 11:08.666
We need this
so we can look each other in the eye.

11:10.750 --> 11:11.875
He's all yours.

11:26.875 --> 11:29.791
Let's enjoy recess
before the girls come back.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.791
-Let's go.
-Let's do this.

11:37.583 --> 11:38.916
We'll let Gandía go.

11:39.791 --> 11:42.375
But before we do,
I need to check with the Professor.

11:44.708 --> 11:46.458
Ask him whatever you want.

11:47.125 --> 11:48.750
You've got four minutes.

11:49.416 --> 11:51.000
What do you suggest we do?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.791
Organize an escape.

11:53.791 --> 11:55.666
With 10, 15 or 20 hostages.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.166
Deal.

12:01.916 --> 12:03.791
Take them to a safe area.

12:11.833 --> 12:15.875
-You know there are no safe areas inside.
-Of course there are.

12:15.958 --> 12:17.416
Come on…

12:17.916 --> 12:21.125
Any of the four vaults
that open with my fingerprint.

12:22.166 --> 12:23.083
Hit me.

12:27.666 --> 12:28.541
I said hit me.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.166
Hit me!

12:39.625 --> 12:43.250
-Do you know why I'm going to kill you?
-Because I groped your girlfriend's ass.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.166
No…

12:44.833 --> 12:46.000
Because you're a fascist.

12:49.458 --> 12:52.000
As soon as you lift a gun
to defend your country,

12:52.083 --> 12:54.041
some asshole calls you a fascist.

12:59.666 --> 13:00.625
Open the door!

13:04.041 --> 13:05.708
You're fascist for saying "mutt."

13:08.166 --> 13:09.291
"Gypsy."

13:11.333 --> 13:12.583
What the hell?

13:12.666 --> 13:14.291
Close the doors! Get in line!

13:14.375 --> 13:16.250
Back off! Now!

13:16.333 --> 13:18.291
-I said back off!
-"Redneck!"

13:18.375 --> 13:20.750
-Against the wall! Hands up!
-Stop it!

13:20.833 --> 13:22.875
For calling Palermo a "one-eyed queer…"

13:24.083 --> 13:25.083
Right now!

13:26.500 --> 13:28.375
-Leave them alone!
-Stop it!

13:28.458 --> 13:29.875
…and a "wetback!"

13:29.958 --> 13:31.666
-What are you doing?
-You're racist!

13:31.750 --> 13:34.625
We're trying to make miracles happen
and you set up a fight.

13:34.708 --> 13:35.791
You're sexist!

13:35.875 --> 13:37.041
-Stop them!
-No!

13:37.125 --> 13:38.791
You're homophobic!

13:42.166 --> 13:44.000
And this is for Nairobi.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.125
Bogotá.

13:47.583 --> 13:48.458
Bogotá.

13:49.041 --> 13:51.833
-He killed Nairobi.
-The police don't have the Professor.

13:56.791 --> 13:58.250
Nairobi wouldn't want this.

13:59.625 --> 14:02.750
Tamayo doesn't know anything
about the Professor. It's not checkmate.

14:02.833 --> 14:04.125
We stand a chance.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.500
-He killed her.
-Let him go.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.666
Let him go.

14:20.666 --> 14:22.083
Do I still turn you on?

14:25.416 --> 14:26.500
Tokyo…

14:29.041 --> 14:30.291
You missed it.

14:31.416 --> 14:32.291
Boom.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.250
Come on, recess is over!

14:46.500 --> 14:48.833
-Stitch him up.
-I'll kill you, asshole!

14:48.916 --> 14:51.125
She knocked me out, fucking Sandokan!

14:51.208 --> 14:54.333
Not you!

14:54.416 --> 14:56.208
On the ground, you terrorists!

15:03.291 --> 15:04.958
Fuck!

15:06.333 --> 15:09.000
-This way, come on!
-Get them out of here!

15:13.583 --> 15:15.375
-Denver!
-Denver!

15:20.500 --> 15:21.708
Fucking hell.

15:24.541 --> 15:26.916
It's okay, keep calm.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.416
Let me see the wound.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.250
-Stay calm. It's okay.
-There's an exit wound.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.916
I need the surgical kit.

15:37.000 --> 15:37.833
-Now!
-Coming.

15:37.916 --> 15:39.833
Get the kit. Your gun, let's go!

15:40.625 --> 15:42.875
Helsinki, Manila, the hostages have fled.

15:42.958 --> 15:46.000
They hit Denver and some of their own.
They've got weapons!

15:46.083 --> 15:47.083
Copy that.

15:47.833 --> 15:48.666
Let's go!

15:50.125 --> 15:52.708
You stay here. Don't let anyone move.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.458
Let's go!

16:00.750 --> 16:01.916
Let me see.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.041
That son of a bitch.

16:09.125 --> 16:10.833
Denver.

16:11.708 --> 16:13.541
Fix Gandía, he's top priority!

16:14.041 --> 16:15.291
Denver!

16:16.750 --> 16:17.708
Fuck!

16:17.791 --> 16:19.833
I need a medical unit by the door!

16:19.916 --> 16:24.416
The bank's head of security is about
to come out with a severe prognosis.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.583
You're the next to move.
You're in charge of the intervention.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.875
-With what men?
-Special Forces III.

16:29.958 --> 16:32.000
You know most of them. They're the best.

16:32.083 --> 16:34.166
-Cañizo!
-At your command, sir!

16:34.250 --> 16:36.083
Get your men ready immediately.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.041
Yes, sir.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.708
-How's the recording?
-It sounds like a shooting.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.750
I told you I'd go in with my team.

16:43.541 --> 16:44.750
I want them.

16:44.833 --> 16:47.625
The guys you requested
are out of the question.

16:50.375 --> 16:53.500
Colonel, it's going to be a massacre.

16:54.083 --> 16:57.708
I need men who won't ask who's behind
the mask when they have to shoot.

16:59.625 --> 17:02.541
And Special Forces will,
because somewhere in their brains

17:02.625 --> 17:05.375
lies the notion of rescuing hostages.

17:05.875 --> 17:10.375
I need people who will go in there
to conquer territory, not to save lives.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.916
What percentage of civilian casualties
are we talking about?

17:15.708 --> 17:18.375
Well, don't count on more than…

17:19.875 --> 17:21.458
thirty percent surviving.

17:23.958 --> 17:26.291
Either I go in with my team…
or I don't go in.

17:26.375 --> 17:27.250
Your team?

17:30.208 --> 17:33.541
Mateo Canalejas,
arrested for playing Russian roulette

17:33.625 --> 17:36.083
with his service weapon
in a joint in Tbilisi.

17:36.166 --> 17:40.041
Arantxa Arteche organizes
illegal monkey fights in Gibraltar.

17:40.125 --> 17:41.041
What a fucking joke.

17:41.125 --> 17:44.125
Salvador Torrecilla
pretended Boko Haram kidnapped him

17:44.208 --> 17:47.541
after spending six days copulating
with the chancellor's daughter in Mali.

17:47.625 --> 17:50.958
Shall I continue?
Ramiro Vázquez, your trusted bomb expert,

17:51.041 --> 17:52.791
is in the Mondragón mental hospital.

17:52.875 --> 17:56.166
I'm aware of all that.
They're all outside, waiting.

17:56.833 --> 17:59.375
I called them
when the Professor started throwing bills.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.375
Should I get them…

18:02.583 --> 18:03.458
Colonel?

18:09.916 --> 18:10.750
Sagasta.

18:13.041 --> 18:15.041
Don't fuck with me.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.541
Go to the right!

18:30.083 --> 18:32.666
Palermo! Come out to play, motherfucker!

18:37.791 --> 18:38.791
Fuck!

18:39.500 --> 18:40.416
Fuck!

18:42.125 --> 18:44.208
-Shoot the vests!
-Shoot the ceiling!

18:51.750 --> 18:52.583
Get down.

18:52.666 --> 18:54.791
-Helsinki, they're headed your way.
-Get down!

18:54.875 --> 18:56.333
Do you copy, fatty?

19:04.000 --> 19:04.833
Help!

19:04.916 --> 19:05.958
We're right here!

19:07.791 --> 19:08.750
Cover me!

19:13.666 --> 19:14.583
Lisbon!

19:21.125 --> 19:23.291
We're trapped! There's no way out!

19:27.875 --> 19:29.125
I don't want to die!

19:33.750 --> 19:35.583
We won't make it to the vaults,

19:35.666 --> 19:38.166
but we can get them out
through the loading dock.

19:38.250 --> 19:41.000
-How?
-Through the next door. Cover us!

19:41.083 --> 19:42.083
Come on!

19:52.750 --> 19:54.375
-For fuck's sake!
-Fuck!

19:56.916 --> 19:59.916
-They're heading to the loading docks.
-Follow them!

20:00.000 --> 20:02.125
Palermo, with me.
We'll use the other door.

20:02.208 --> 20:05.416
Helsinki! Go to the top floor.
Report any troop movement.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.666
Weapons, ammunition, men, anything.
I want to know if they're coming.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.000
Let's go.

20:13.375 --> 20:16.000
Let's go! Matías,
take five of your hostages.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.041
Let's go!

20:18.125 --> 20:20.000
To the library, now!

20:20.083 --> 20:21.375
Come on!

20:21.458 --> 20:22.541
Inspector.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.875
It's confirmed, shots were fired.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.583
Through this hallway. Run!

20:46.791 --> 20:48.375
Let's go. Down this hallway.

20:48.458 --> 20:49.916
-Run!
-This way!

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Run!

21:00.083 --> 21:01.833
They're coming!

21:02.875 --> 21:03.708
Fuck!

21:09.291 --> 21:10.541
Get down.

21:10.625 --> 21:11.708
Okay, let's go.

21:11.791 --> 21:12.833
Back off!

21:14.291 --> 21:15.250
Shoot the vests.

21:16.333 --> 21:17.208
Watch out!

21:17.291 --> 21:18.333
Come on!

21:29.291 --> 21:30.125
Shit.

21:30.208 --> 21:31.541
We're fucked.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.125
Let's go, guys. This way!

21:38.125 --> 21:40.708
-They've blocked the exit with steel…
-Shit.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.666
…and explosives.

21:45.875 --> 21:48.708
They're the ones who are fucked, Governor.

21:57.291 --> 21:59.333
All their weapons are here.

22:09.041 --> 22:10.791
My name is Alicia Sierra.

22:10.875 --> 22:15.500
I'm an inspector with the National Police…
They've issued a warrant for my arrest.

22:16.458 --> 22:19.750
I'm recording this video
in case the police or the CNI

22:19.833 --> 22:23.458
try to hide, distort
or misrepresent the real facts.

22:26.166 --> 22:29.458
But I won't fall apart on you all
because today calls for celebration.

22:30.333 --> 22:33.375
Here we are. Look who's here with me.

22:34.333 --> 22:37.250
Let's see. Here we are, in the hideout…

22:38.333 --> 22:40.000
of this smart little animal.

22:40.916 --> 22:41.916
The Professor.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.458
Wave to the camera, Mr. Marquina.

22:46.958 --> 22:47.958
Mr. Marquina?

22:48.041 --> 22:50.541
-This isn't necessary.
-Of course it is.

22:50.625 --> 22:53.750
Tell us, Mr. Professor, who arrested you?

22:58.208 --> 22:59.458
-You did.
-You, who?

22:59.541 --> 23:01.000
Do your part.

23:01.583 --> 23:04.250
I've been arrested
by inspector Alicia Sierra.

23:05.916 --> 23:07.166
Exactly!

23:08.500 --> 23:10.166
Cross my heart and hope to die.

23:10.250 --> 23:14.750
I, Alicia Sierra,
at 9:50 a.m. on April 8th,

23:14.833 --> 23:19.500
located the abandoned stormwater tank
at kilometer 21 on the road--

23:19.583 --> 23:20.750
Can I tell the truth?

23:22.958 --> 23:24.375
I'd like to tell the truth.

23:26.666 --> 23:27.708
Go ahead.

23:32.125 --> 23:36.833
I recruited one of your officers.
He was part of the Paris Plan.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.875
We recruited Mr. Benito Antoñanzas.

23:39.958 --> 23:42.708
Antoñanzas jumped
into his gated community's swimming pool

23:43.541 --> 23:47.125
from his home,
specifically from his bathroom window.

23:47.208 --> 23:51.541
And that's when I began to leave a trail.

23:54.458 --> 23:58.375
In your colleague's defense, we made
him fear for his and his family's life--

23:58.458 --> 24:01.541
Shut the fuck up.
What did you have for lunch, a parrot?

24:02.333 --> 24:03.750
He won't stop chatting.

24:03.833 --> 24:06.791
I'm trying to set the facts straight
and tell the truth.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.541
You've been lying the whole time.

24:08.625 --> 24:11.333
You didn't even tell
your brother the truth.

24:11.416 --> 24:14.208
-What's going on?
-That's why now's the time…

24:14.958 --> 24:17.708
Fuck you. Keep your fucking mouth shut!

24:17.791 --> 24:19.500
Marseille!

24:19.583 --> 24:23.000
I'll blow your fucking head off.
Shut your mouth.

24:24.125 --> 24:27.750
Marseille! Code red!

24:28.833 --> 24:30.916
Marseille! Benjamín!

24:31.000 --> 24:31.833
Marseille!

24:49.291 --> 24:50.125
Shit!

24:54.125 --> 24:55.250
Hell yeah.

24:57.458 --> 24:59.958
Marseille! Police!

25:03.083 --> 25:06.708
Marseille! Police!

25:08.500 --> 25:11.500
I'm not a police officer anymore,
four-eyes.

25:14.875 --> 25:15.708
Marse…

25:16.833 --> 25:17.833
Marseille…

25:19.250 --> 25:21.458
Mars…

25:34.958 --> 25:36.958
-You need a tourniquet.
-I'm okay.

25:45.625 --> 25:48.000
Come on, Amanda, Miguel, grab some guns.

25:48.791 --> 25:50.083
You can do it.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.541
Let's go, you two!

25:55.500 --> 25:56.708
The windows.

25:58.041 --> 26:00.708
You two, cover from the windows.

26:03.875 --> 26:07.583
-Do you know what you're doing?
-Of course. What has to be done.

26:08.416 --> 26:09.416
I don't think you do.

26:31.208 --> 26:32.375
The windows!

26:38.708 --> 26:40.666
Get back! Get out of here!

26:47.083 --> 26:49.583
Stop this. You got two people injured.

26:49.666 --> 26:52.625
Yes, but I saved four
and we've got their weapons.

26:52.708 --> 26:53.583
Look at me!

26:54.666 --> 26:56.333
They both have families.

26:59.375 --> 27:03.083
It wasn't my fault.
It was the damn recoil.

27:03.166 --> 27:04.958
Collateral damage.

27:05.041 --> 27:09.000
This is war! Can't you see?
Churchill would see it as a victory.

27:09.958 --> 27:11.291
Ammunition?

27:14.666 --> 27:16.250
-Two clips.
-What?

27:16.333 --> 27:19.041
We can't cover the hallway with two clips.

27:19.125 --> 27:20.166
God damn it.

27:21.916 --> 27:23.083
We need to blow it up.

27:23.166 --> 27:26.708
If the weapons in there explode,
the entire building will collapse.

27:27.208 --> 27:29.833
-We have no other choice.
-We need grenades.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.666
Where the hell do we get those?

27:34.833 --> 27:37.083
I know where there are grenades.
And much more.

27:37.166 --> 27:40.666
Distract them. They won't suspect
we went to get explosives. Lisbon…

27:43.083 --> 27:44.750
Good luck, Tokyo!

27:55.041 --> 27:58.750
We heard shots in the building.
Something serious is going on.

27:58.833 --> 28:02.791
It's the same as always.
The Valencia or Beijing Plan. It's a show.

28:02.875 --> 28:05.375
They're blowing stuff up
so we change our road map.

28:05.458 --> 28:08.500
They're assault rifles.
There are civilians in there.

28:08.583 --> 28:10.000
-Suárez, please.
-Colonel.

28:10.791 --> 28:13.041
Are you organizing
an operation behind my back?

28:13.125 --> 28:16.750
-Would it be an issue if I were?
-This is a civil conflict.

28:16.833 --> 28:21.500
-I demand to be part of any intervention.
-You demand? Who do you think you are?

28:21.583 --> 28:25.125
I'm the inspector in charge
of the special operations group.

28:25.625 --> 28:30.041
No matter how hard you try to ignore us,
let me remind you we killed Berlin

28:30.125 --> 28:32.083
while fighting against his Browning.

28:38.333 --> 28:39.250
Sagasta!

28:40.333 --> 28:42.791
Sagasta, go in with your team. Right now!

28:47.833 --> 28:50.041
Okay.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.500
Rio! Come with me.

29:02.958 --> 29:06.125
-Motherfucker!
-Don't move!

29:06.208 --> 29:08.750
You're a son of a bitch, Denver.

29:08.833 --> 29:09.666
What?

29:11.208 --> 29:14.625
You kicked me out of the previous heist,
the good one.

29:14.708 --> 29:17.583
But you call me for this one,
which is a fucking mousetrap.

29:17.666 --> 29:21.666
I'm doing this because I'm a good person,
but I should be doing this to your balls!

29:25.250 --> 29:26.708
Back off!

29:38.958 --> 29:39.833
Denver!

29:40.333 --> 29:43.583
Listen. You're bleeding
like a stuck pig, come back.

29:43.666 --> 29:47.250
Okay. Your arm will go numb,
but it'll be fine, okay?

29:47.333 --> 29:48.958
You can go now.

29:50.791 --> 29:53.500
-What are you going to do with that?
-Make them dance.

29:53.583 --> 29:57.583
Didn't you say we should be heroes?
That's exactly what I'm doing.

29:57.666 --> 29:59.708
The hostages are in the armory

30:00.500 --> 30:02.250
and we have two fucking clips left.

30:03.916 --> 30:05.166
I'm not going anywhere.

30:07.333 --> 30:10.333
We can't attack rashly.
We have their weapons.

30:10.916 --> 30:12.916
It's a matter of time
until the army attacks.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.875
Honey. Dani, sweetie, please come back.

30:15.958 --> 30:18.375
I'm fine, okay? I'm great.

30:18.458 --> 30:19.541
You're not fine.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.833
It's our job to defend
this position intelligently.

30:27.291 --> 30:30.000
Defend? An Italian defense? Huh?

30:30.500 --> 30:33.541
With little Messi on our team?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.083
And Neymar?

30:38.583 --> 30:40.333
And Cristiano Ronaldo?

30:40.833 --> 30:44.666
No, we're not playing defense here.
We're playing tiki-taka!

30:46.166 --> 30:47.791
Come on, go get some cover.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.083
Your turn.

31:10.958 --> 31:12.666
-Grenade!
-Grenade!

31:30.958 --> 31:31.916
Are you okay?

31:33.583 --> 31:34.875
How are you?

31:35.375 --> 31:36.291
Bad!

31:39.375 --> 31:41.375
Arturo!

31:41.458 --> 31:43.833
I'm going to rip your balls off!

31:43.916 --> 31:46.958
They're right here, you bastard!

31:47.750 --> 31:49.375
Come pay me a visit!

32:16.500 --> 32:17.375
Fucking hell!

32:18.208 --> 32:20.500
-Are you okay?
-No!

32:27.458 --> 32:29.916
They've got enough ammo for four wars!

32:30.000 --> 32:31.333
We're fucked!

32:32.083 --> 32:34.708
-What is this?
-Put it down, it's a flamethrower.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.750
A flamethrower, huh?

32:43.875 --> 32:46.666
Everything in here
is flammable and explosive!

32:47.333 --> 32:48.750
Don't worry, Governor.

32:50.750 --> 32:52.625
The barbecue will be out there.

32:56.416 --> 32:58.625
…is for all of you who see this mask

32:58.708 --> 33:00.666
as a symbol of the resistance.

33:03.500 --> 33:04.708
We need you.

33:07.125 --> 33:09.333
The State has declared war on us.

33:10.916 --> 33:12.416
A filthy war.

33:17.208 --> 33:18.166
Professor?

33:19.375 --> 33:21.208
And we've decided to face them.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.208
The police have detained
one of us in a foreign country.

33:29.666 --> 33:30.666
Aníbal Cortés.

33:31.875 --> 33:34.166
It's been almost two months
since his arrest.

33:36.250 --> 33:38.875
They haven't filed
formal charges against him.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.208
Professor?

33:41.291 --> 33:42.958
They haven't requested extradition.

33:43.041 --> 33:45.166
Marseille. The bathroom.

33:45.250 --> 33:48.125
-They haven't provided him with a lawyer.
-Go check it out.

33:50.416 --> 33:51.875
He's being held captive…

33:53.791 --> 33:54.625
Hello?

33:55.583 --> 33:56.833
Anyone in there?

33:56.916 --> 33:59.708
…somewhere unknown, and in all likelihood…

34:01.125 --> 34:02.458
they're torturing him.

34:05.208 --> 34:06.750
So we demand

34:08.250 --> 34:11.916
that this illegal detention
be brought to an end immediately

34:12.000 --> 34:15.625
and that he be brought to justice in a way
that respects legal standards.

34:15.708 --> 34:18.208
-The State started this war…
-Benjamín.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.833
…and we will not hide.

34:20.916 --> 34:22.166
He's sleeping.

34:23.041 --> 34:24.458
We will fight,

34:26.291 --> 34:27.333
blow…

34:28.500 --> 34:29.750
for blow.

34:30.666 --> 34:31.666
And this time…

34:35.083 --> 34:37.083
it will be an even bigger heist.

34:37.958 --> 34:39.541
Well done, Professor.

35:45.750 --> 35:48.583
The next shots
will clear out the whole toilet,

35:48.666 --> 35:51.208
so throw your gun under the door
and come out behind it.

35:52.875 --> 35:54.000
Very well.

35:54.083 --> 35:57.000
Three, two…

35:58.666 --> 35:59.500
one.

36:04.958 --> 36:06.333
Who the fuck are you?

36:07.375 --> 36:08.875
-Logroño?
-I…

36:09.375 --> 36:10.875
don't have a…

36:11.500 --> 36:12.583
city name.

36:19.958 --> 36:23.041
Shit! The tank is running out of oxygen.

36:32.166 --> 36:34.416
It's refilling. It'll take a minute.

36:47.375 --> 36:49.666
In the bathtub,
I told you to break up with me.

36:51.041 --> 36:52.625
But I didn't say my last words.

36:56.291 --> 36:57.916
You're not leaving here without me.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.250
You know that, right?

37:03.833 --> 37:05.125
You'd have to kidnap me.

37:07.166 --> 37:09.083
That's a bad way to start over.

37:11.291 --> 37:12.416
But it'd be hot.

37:13.875 --> 37:16.166
I've learned
a few tricks about kidnappings.

37:16.250 --> 37:18.625
How to tie people up… and all that.

37:21.791 --> 37:24.125
Are you cutting steel or hitting on me?

37:28.833 --> 37:30.500
I can do two things at once.

37:34.083 --> 37:35.708
And I could do a third one.

37:41.791 --> 37:45.541
You three,
get in the first vehicle! Move!

37:46.125 --> 37:47.083
It's Helsinki.

37:47.916 --> 37:49.625
There's movement outside.

37:49.708 --> 37:52.583
The army's special ops.

37:52.666 --> 37:54.750
They're loaded with every kind of weapon.

37:54.833 --> 37:58.791
A C-90 rocket-launcher,
grenade launchers, machine guns,

37:59.291 --> 38:00.541
shotguns, rifles.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.208
Come on, let's go!

38:03.458 --> 38:06.958
They're getting in two LMVs.
Shit, immediate intervention!

38:08.958 --> 38:12.791
Bogotá, Lisbon speaking.
Let Gandía go immediately.

38:15.125 --> 38:17.500
He'll tell them
we're chasing the hostages.

38:17.583 --> 38:19.500
If we don't, they'll break in now!

38:19.583 --> 38:22.541
We don't have any weapons.
The hostages have taken the armory.

38:31.041 --> 38:34.208
Hey! Cover me! All of you!

38:36.333 --> 38:37.500
Fuck!

38:37.583 --> 38:38.500
God!

38:45.375 --> 38:46.208
God!

38:48.541 --> 38:49.958
Denver!

38:51.500 --> 38:53.583
I am Cincinnati's dad!

38:53.666 --> 38:55.166
You fucking dick.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.291
Come give me a kiss!

38:57.791 --> 39:01.291
-Who's the father? I don't get it.
-Shut up or I'll staple your mouth shut.

39:01.375 --> 39:02.375
Come here!

39:10.666 --> 39:12.583
-Area secured.
-All clear.

39:12.666 --> 39:15.041
-Get ready to intervene.
-Clear, Colonel.

39:15.125 --> 39:16.875
Green light. We can proceed.

39:16.958 --> 39:17.791
Now!

39:22.833 --> 39:23.750
He's ready.

39:25.000 --> 39:25.916
Come on.

39:44.250 --> 39:45.625
Son of a bitch!

39:45.708 --> 39:46.833
Arturito!

39:46.916 --> 39:51.541
Do you believe in reincarnation?
If not, then you better negotiate, right?

39:52.833 --> 39:54.291
Can you hold your breath?

39:54.375 --> 39:58.708
For as long as it would take me
to fuck your mother up the ass.

40:00.416 --> 40:01.458
Is that enough?

40:12.375 --> 40:13.416
It's fentanyl.

40:13.500 --> 40:14.583
The doors are opening.

40:17.250 --> 40:19.416
Let's see if this doesn't
knock you out either.

40:26.958 --> 40:30.083
The hostages!

40:30.166 --> 40:33.083
-What the fuck is that?
-The hostages are…

40:37.333 --> 40:38.833
The hostages…

40:41.625 --> 40:43.625
Abort the intervention!

40:46.708 --> 40:48.625
The hostages are…

40:58.291 --> 40:59.541
Confirmed, Colonel.

40:59.625 --> 41:02.500
It's Gandía, Colonel. It's Gandía!

41:02.583 --> 41:05.500
Sagasta, abort operation
until further notice.

41:12.916 --> 41:14.333
The hostages…

41:17.750 --> 41:18.750
Denver.

41:20.208 --> 41:23.375
I know you're listening.
Do you think she loves you?

41:24.250 --> 41:25.333
Denver?

41:26.666 --> 41:27.666
No.

41:28.916 --> 41:30.791
You're not man enough for her.

41:31.375 --> 41:33.083
She used to tell me

41:33.166 --> 41:35.708
I taught her what love is.

41:35.791 --> 41:38.291
Did she ever
say anything like that to you? No.

41:38.791 --> 41:40.333
Do you know why?

41:41.083 --> 41:44.791
Because you lack the intelligence
to get where I got.

41:45.416 --> 41:48.916
Your personal vendetta
is putting us all at risk!

41:49.000 --> 41:49.833
Shut up!

41:51.166 --> 41:56.125
I know that kid as if he were my own son.
I know where to scratch to rile him up.

41:56.791 --> 42:00.458
And that's what I'm going to do.
When he comes out, I'll scorch him.

42:05.750 --> 42:06.625
With me…

42:08.125 --> 42:11.375
she never wondered,
"What am I doing with this guy?"

42:11.958 --> 42:13.041
Never.

42:13.125 --> 42:14.583
And I was married.

42:15.416 --> 42:16.625
And she knew.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.458
But she couldn't leave my side
for a second.

42:19.541 --> 42:23.375
Sparks flew between us

42:24.208 --> 42:26.750
every time we ran into each other
by the coffee maker.

42:26.833 --> 42:28.166
Give me your gun.

42:28.250 --> 42:30.083
We were doing it all the time.

42:32.041 --> 42:33.916
In every corner.

42:34.875 --> 42:35.708
One year…

42:40.083 --> 42:41.291
after another.

42:41.875 --> 42:44.458
We made love everywhere, Denver.

42:45.541 --> 42:49.833
It didn't matter
if we were under the printer,

42:50.875 --> 42:52.500
in the cafeteria bathroom,

42:53.791 --> 42:55.083
or in my office.

42:58.583 --> 43:00.416
Or on the coin display cabinet.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.000
It didn't matter.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.541
And every night…

43:09.958 --> 43:13.208
Every night, as soon as she got home,

43:14.125 --> 43:16.375
she wrote me these beautiful texts,

43:17.916 --> 43:19.208
sent me photos

43:20.958 --> 43:24.250
and told me and promised me

43:24.333 --> 43:27.500
she had never felt like that before
and couldn't live without me.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.125
Denver,

43:30.708 --> 43:32.833
has she ever told you anything like that?

43:33.416 --> 43:35.000
I bet she hasn't.

43:35.500 --> 43:36.958
-Give me the walkie-talkie.
-No.

43:37.041 --> 43:39.958
Why didn't you have another child?
Your own child!

43:41.291 --> 43:45.083
You stole her from me, you bastard!
You had to kidnap her!

43:45.166 --> 43:48.708
And before she knew it,
she was in the middle of nowhere,

43:48.791 --> 43:51.875
doomed to share her life with a bumpkin!

43:53.791 --> 43:54.958
No, man, don't!

44:00.083 --> 44:01.875
Come on!

44:01.958 --> 44:03.458
Keep a cool head,

44:03.541 --> 44:04.708
for fuck's sake!

44:09.250 --> 44:12.625
Tokyo will be here
with the weapons any second now.

44:13.250 --> 44:14.625
Keep your cool.

44:14.708 --> 44:18.500
I'm sorry.

44:20.500 --> 44:21.375
Weapons!

44:22.583 --> 44:23.958
They have more weapons.

44:24.041 --> 44:25.125
Fuck!

44:25.750 --> 44:26.875
Change of plans!

44:26.958 --> 44:28.625
You two, get those shields

44:28.708 --> 44:31.833
and set up the Browning
on the forklift. Now!

44:37.291 --> 44:40.083
There's no military logic
to abandoning our position.

44:46.583 --> 44:48.583
Out there you have no chance.

44:48.666 --> 44:51.250
Listen to me closely,
because I won't say this twice.

44:55.208 --> 44:58.791
They're attacking us. And you heard them,
they have more weapons.

45:02.708 --> 45:04.333
As soon as they bring them here,

45:04.416 --> 45:07.166
this will become a rat trap
and they'll finish us off!

45:12.166 --> 45:14.833
I told you, we need to strike!

45:18.083 --> 45:19.166
Now!

45:26.333 --> 45:27.416
Let's go.

45:33.291 --> 45:36.250
They stopped covering the windows.
We can't wait any longer.

45:36.333 --> 45:37.708
Attack quickly! Now!

45:50.833 --> 45:52.500
-What the fuck is that?
-Back off!

45:53.166 --> 45:54.000
Open!

46:03.583 --> 46:04.541
Close!

46:13.041 --> 46:14.208
Open!

46:18.083 --> 46:20.000
Last clip!

46:30.000 --> 46:30.916
Close!

46:32.583 --> 46:33.708
Open!

46:33.791 --> 46:35.000
Shit!

46:37.541 --> 46:39.208
We're out of ammo!

46:49.166 --> 46:50.083
Arturo!

47:02.875 --> 47:04.125
Mónica…

47:07.000 --> 47:08.083
Calm down.

47:12.916 --> 47:14.416
Move and I'll shoot him!

47:16.750 --> 47:17.875
On your knees!

47:17.958 --> 47:19.041
Come on, get down.

47:20.583 --> 47:22.791
Don't do anything you'll regret.

47:24.375 --> 47:25.875
Put the gun down, please.

47:30.791 --> 47:32.416
But you won't shoot…

47:33.083 --> 47:33.916
right?

47:34.625 --> 47:36.291
You'd never shoot your son's dad.

47:37.125 --> 47:38.708
Do you know how I know?

47:40.375 --> 47:44.833
I'll be the only one left to look after
that child when this is all over.

47:46.750 --> 47:50.000
-The only one he won't be embarrassed by.
-Get down!

47:52.083 --> 47:53.125
Don't you understand?

47:56.750 --> 47:57.916
Don't you get it?

47:59.000 --> 48:01.291
Don't pretend to be someone you're not.

48:01.791 --> 48:06.666
You'll never be one of them.

48:09.458 --> 48:11.125
You'll always be a secret--

50:00.666 --> 50:04.166
