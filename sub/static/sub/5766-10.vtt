(cell phone ringing)

00:09.070 --> 00:11.231
(phone ringing nearby)

00:13.080 --> 00:16.049
(workplace murmurings)

00:38.830 --> 00:41.094
(phone ringing)

00:42.210 --> 00:43.529
(ringing continues)

00:47.640 --> 00:48.777
Hello.

00:48.810 --> 00:50.846
Alicia Florrick's... office.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.074
May I help you?

00:52.120 --> 00:53.610
DIANE:
Hello. Is Alicia there?

00:53.650 --> 00:55.242
I am sorry, but Alicia

00:55.280 --> 00:56.838
is away from her desk
at the moment.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.243
May I take a message?

00:58.290 --> 01:00.087
Yes. I...

01:00.120 --> 01:01.451
Who is this?

01:01.490 --> 01:02.650
Uh, this is Owen.

01:02.690 --> 01:03.782
Who is this?

01:04.830 --> 01:06.627
Diane.

01:06.660 --> 01:08.298
Diane, hello.

01:08.330 --> 01:11.265
Would you like to leave
a message of some specificity?

01:11.300 --> 01:13.768
Uh, yes. I would.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.165
Thank you.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.259
Uh, tell Alicia
to phone me back, please.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.709
Thank you.

01:20.510 --> 01:22.671
I don't think
this is a good idea.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.143
_We want
ElI's busmess.

01:24.180 --> 01:27.411
Eli goes where
the Florricks go.

01:27.450 --> 01:28.439
(knocking)
Hello.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.582
Hello.

01:30.620 --> 01:31.848
Alicia's not in.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.209
I see.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.249
And you're...

01:34.290 --> 01:36.258
I'm Alicia's brother, Owen.

01:36.290 --> 01:37.689
Oh! Hey!

01:37.730 --> 01:38.685
I'm sorry.

01:38.730 --> 01:39.856
I-I didn't know you were,

01:39.900 --> 01:41.652
uh...

01:41.700 --> 01:42.826
I... I'm Will.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.519
Her... boss.

01:44.570 --> 01:45.628
Her boss.

01:45.670 --> 01:46.796
That-that's impressive.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.331
Nah, I try not
to flash it around a lot.

01:50.370 --> 01:52.304
How's my sis doing, as a lawyer?

01:52.340 --> 01:53.830
Good. Great, really.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.438
Well, don't
tell her that.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.799
She-she works best
when she's worried

01:56.850 --> 01:58.203
that she's not living up

01:58.250 --> 01:59.444
to other people's
expectations.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.345
(chuckles)
That's good to know.

02:01.380 --> 02:03.689
As soon as I hear something,
I'll let you know.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.162
Oh, hi.
Hi.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.428
Hi.

02:21.470 --> 02:23.563
I brought you something
from Botswana.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.532
How... nice.

02:25.570 --> 02:27.572
And here I thought
you were gone for another

02:27.610 --> 02:29.669
two weeks.
Came back early.
Isn't that fun?

02:29.710 --> 02:31.803
We've been getting
better acquainted.

02:31.850 --> 02:33.818
Okay. So that makes me nervous.

02:33.850 --> 02:35.818
So I'll let you two talk.

02:35.850 --> 02:36.646
Just one quick thing.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.783
The Murphy/Gomes suit?
Yeah, we're...

02:38.820 --> 02:40.708
we're right on target.
No, some...

02:40.760 --> 02:41.818
Murphy's son.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.452
He got picked
up last night

02:43.490 --> 02:45.287
at Cook State College
on a drug charge.

02:45.330 --> 02:47.594
Prescription stimulant--
small-time.

02:47.630 --> 02:49.769
But I guess it's quite the thing
to do during finals week.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.290
ALICIA:
First offense?

02:51.330 --> 02:52.558
Yeah. A 1410
at the worst.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.737
Look, I could put a
junior associate on it,

02:53.770 --> 02:55.738
but Murphy/Gomes is
such a cash cow.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.863
No, no. Don't worry
about it. I've got it.

02:57.910 --> 03:00.299
WILL: Kalinda will phone
when she finds out where

03:00.340 --> 03:01.432
he's being processed.
Okay.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.606
Owen. It's really nice
to meet you.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.709
Oh, nice to meet you,
too, Will--

03:04.750 --> 03:06.638
what was it again?
Gardner.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.875
Gardner,
of course.

03:11.890 --> 03:14.518
That's a familiar name.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.709
What happened, Owen?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.387
You're supposed to be
on vacation.

03:17.430 --> 03:18.886
(sighs)

03:18.930 --> 03:20.750
Okay, look,
I broke up with Kevin.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.791
It's not a big deal,
but I just don't want

03:22.830 --> 03:24.320
to have a big
harangue about it.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.826
Oh, Owen, I thought
Kevin was the keeper.

03:25.870 --> 03:26.859
He was.

03:26.900 --> 03:27.798
He's not anymore.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.364
May I?

03:29.410 --> 03:30.559
Oh, please.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.578
(sighs)

03:32.610 --> 03:33.872
What happened?

03:33.910 --> 03:35.502
He cheated on me.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.939
When? On vacation?

03:36.980 --> 03:38.242
You know, I
don't even care.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.841
I'm just going to live alone,
like an aging writer with dogs.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.381
Open your present.

03:43.420 --> 03:44.785
So, are you hiding out?

03:51.730 --> 03:52.697
(jingling)

03:52.730 --> 03:54.425
It's an Mbukushu wig,

03:54.460 --> 03:55.927
worn by African women
when they work.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.393
Put it on.

03:57.430 --> 03:58.727
How thoughtful.

03:58.770 --> 04:01.432
(cell phone rings)

04:01.470 --> 04:02.835
Yeah.

04:02.870 --> 04:04.735
KALIN DA:
Drexel and 6lst Street.

04:04.770 --> 04:06.909
His name is Jonathan Murphy, 22.

04:06.940 --> 04:07.929
How long ago?

04:07.980 --> 04:09.675
An hour.

04:09.710 --> 04:12.417
They won't agree to a 1410
until he IDs the dealer.

04:12.450 --> 04:13.678
What? Why?

04:13.720 --> 04:14.948
Ah, it's a slow Friday.

04:14.980 --> 04:15.969
They're being hard-asses.

04:16.020 --> 04:18.443
I'll be right there.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.685
(keys jangling)
Don't pick a fight with Peter.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.418
I'm only an hour behind you.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.779
Look at you, going off to war.

04:24.830 --> 04:27.799
Don't forget
your headdress.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.821
Two?
Yep.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.861
Jonathan and
his girlfriend,

04:32.900 --> 04:33.992
Alexis Symanski.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.496
They've been together
for six months.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.768
ALICIA: Does she
have a lawyer?

04:36.810 --> 04:38.004
Nope. She can't
afford one.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.871
Hey. What's the holdup?

04:39.910 --> 04:42.777
(chuckles) What do you think?
ASA involvement.

04:42.810 --> 04:45.938
Hey, I can't even wipe my nose
without ASA giving the okay.

04:46.950 --> 04:47.917
JONATHAN:
We'll be okay.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.440
ALEXIS:
Doesn't work that way.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.445
Yes, it can.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.788
And since when did I
become the optimist here?

04:52.820 --> 04:53.980
ALICIA:
Sorry.

04:54.020 --> 04:55.681
Hi.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.859
I'm your father's lavwer,
Alicia Florrick.

04:57.890 --> 04:58.879
You're Jonathan,
is that correct?

04:58.930 --> 05:00.955
Jon. Yeah, hi.

05:01.000 --> 05:01.955
And you are... ?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.661
Alexis.

05:03.700 --> 05:04.769
I'm with the firm
representing Jon's father,

05:04.800 --> 05:07.689
but I can also process this
for you if you'd like.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.867
Thanks.
Okay.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.559
So you were both
picked up

05:11.610 --> 05:12.975
for buying
prescription drugs

05:13.010 --> 05:15.877
for private use.
Is that correct?

05:15.910 --> 05:17.775
I was. He was just...
No, that's not true.

05:17.810 --> 05:19.971
ALEXIS: Look, I needed to stay
up late and study for finals.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.942
I work two jobs.
No,dont
listen to her.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.641
She doesn't take drugs.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.715
I was the one who
suggested getting them.
Okay.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.911
What you two just did there
is fine for me,

05:27.960 --> 05:29.951
but don't do that
in front of the police.

05:29.990 --> 05:30.922
(whispers):
Okay.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.984
Look, the state's
attorney

05:32.030 --> 05:34.919
will offer
a 1410 probation citing.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.791
That's a case
that remains active

05:36.830 --> 05:38.058
but with
no conVIctIon.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.636
Then Jon will have a record?

05:39.670 --> 05:40.864
For some time.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.800
It's just, um, we
both want to go

05:42.840 --> 05:44.000
to law school.
(door buzzing)

05:46.170 --> 05:48.638
Will you excuse me?

05:50.610 --> 05:51.838
Don't worry.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.017
I'm not here
to make your life harder.

05:53.050 --> 05:55.075
Ijust need an ID.
Are there
any other

05:55.120 --> 05:57.088
ASAs in the
district attorney's office,

05:57.120 --> 05:58.940
or are you
the only one?

05:58.990 --> 06:01.652
I'm the only one assigned
to Lockhart/Gardner cases.

06:01.690 --> 06:02.884
ALICIA: Hmm.
Hey, Kalinda.

06:02.930 --> 06:03.988
KALIN DA:
Cary.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.055
So here's the
deal, Cary.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.421
We ID your drug dealer,
we get drug school,

06:09.470 --> 06:10.425
no record.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.028
Okay. I can agree to that.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.890
Why?

06:13.940 --> 06:15.965
Why can I agree to that?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.968
I don't know. You want
me not to agree to that?

06:18.010 --> 06:20.103
Well, I want you
to tell us what's up.
Okay.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.745
Well, we think this dealer
killed a pharmacist

06:22.780 --> 06:24.771
last night during a burglary,
and we think

06:24.810 --> 06:26.971
these kids can help us
catch him, or her.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.874
Sketch artist
or photo array?

06:28.920 --> 06:29.887
Photo.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.444
So you have someone
in mind, then.

06:31.490 --> 06:32.912
We do.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.758
We think this dealer is a
known assocnate of a name

06:35.790 --> 06:37.155
from your past, Lemond Bishop.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.896
ALICIA:
You want my client

06:39.930 --> 06:41.750
to ID a lieutenant

06:41.800 --> 06:43.461
for the most dangerous
drug gang in Chicago.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.731
I want your clients
to do their civic duty.

06:46.770 --> 06:48.829
So, why don't you two
take a minute?

06:49.840 --> 06:51.137
WILL:
Make the deal.

06:51.170 --> 06:53.104
Cary can make
their life miserable.

06:53.140 --> 06:54.698
Nail them on possession.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.469
Bishop won't touch Murphy's son.

06:56.510 --> 06:57.477
VVho?

06:57.510 --> 06:59.102
His girlfriend.

06:59.150 --> 07:01.038
And she's our problem, why?

07:01.080 --> 07:03.878
Girlfriend, boyfriend;
they seem to come as a package.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.945
Yeah... have Kalinda look into

07:05.990 --> 07:08.015
their antigang protections,
and keep me in the loop.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.527
Make the deal.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.085
(giggling)

07:12.130 --> 07:15.019
Will Gardner,
lawyer extraordinaire.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.789
Yeah, I got a new
tie and everything.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.866
Mm-hmm.
So, can I kIss
you here,

07:18.900 --> 07:20.128
or is that
unprofessnonal?

07:22.140 --> 07:24.062
So, you ready?

07:24.110 --> 07:26.032
I was born ready.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.174
Thanks for
arranging this.
Hey!

07:28.210 --> 07:29.472
Rodney!

07:29.510 --> 07:30.875
MAN:
Hey, Tamara.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.878
So this is the guy
I was talking about.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.239
Mr. Washington,
Will Gardner.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.145
Sorry, I don't shake
lawyers' hands.

07:36.180 --> 07:37.215
He's-he's joking.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.241
Derrick Rose already
has an agent,

07:39.290 --> 07:41.850
two business managers,
three lavwers and me.

07:41.890 --> 07:43.221
Why does he need
a fourth lawyer?

07:43.260 --> 07:44.124
Career longevity.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.128
We stay with him no
matter what he does.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.549
Well, Derrick
was asking about you.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.919
(giggling):
He was not.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.528
WILL: A book, movie,
more sponsorships,

07:51.570 --> 07:53.128
no matter what.

07:53.170 --> 07:54.899
Okay, well, I'll talk
to Derrick about it.

07:54.940 --> 07:56.908
And I'm going
to have him call you.

07:56.940 --> 07:58.999
Stop, stop.

08:03.010 --> 08:04.204
I need to get your pants off.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.172
(keys jangling)

08:06.210 --> 08:08.019
Oh.

08:08.050 --> 08:09.074
Yep. Oh.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.109
It's me.

08:10.150 --> 08:11.981
Alicia's not here.

08:12.020 --> 08:14.181
Yeah, she... gave me her keys.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.653
I'm here to stay the night.

08:15.690 --> 08:17.055
Notice the suitcases?

08:18.160 --> 08:20.993
Well, then, you'd
better come in.

08:21.030 --> 08:22.224
(sighs)

08:23.270 --> 08:25.693
Fun times.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.231
ALEXIS:
HIm.

08:27.270 --> 08:28.999
JONATHAN:
Yeah.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.065
He looked a bit different,
though, without the sideburns.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.236
CARY:
Good. Good.

08:32.270 --> 08:34.306
That's... that's helpful.

08:34.340 --> 08:37.138
And did you see him the night
before, on that corner,

08:37.180 --> 08:38.249
around 11:00?

08:38.280 --> 08:39.042
No.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.674
So you two
were near that corner.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.085
JONATHAN:
No.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.644
I mean, we didn't
see him there,

08:44.690 --> 08:46.214
but not because
he wasn't there,

08:46.250 --> 08:48.286
but because we
weren't there.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.185
You were... where?

08:50.230 --> 08:51.219
Where were you two?

08:51.260 --> 08:52.693
In the library.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.153
Both of you.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.565
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.160
JONATHAN:
Why?
No reason.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.807
Okay. I may need
you two

09:03.840 --> 09:05.159
to stick_around
for a lineup.

09:25.130 --> 09:27.098
(dialing)

09:28.700 --> 09:31.066
KALINDA: _
Hey, I was just trying
to phone you.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.226
Yeah, something's weird here.

09:32.270 --> 09:34.693
I just checked
on antigang preparations.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.037
There are none.

09:36.070 --> 09:37.708
There are...

09:37.740 --> 09:39.162
What do you mean?

09:39.210 --> 09:40.768
There's no investigation
of a dealer.

09:40.810 --> 09:42.107
It's all a scam

09:42.140 --> 09:44.142
to get our clients talking.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.252
That's it. We're done.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.053
Get up, both of you.
No, please stay.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.387
Get up now.
We're ouNt the door.
0.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.227
You are.
They're under arrest for murder.

10:01.260 --> 10:02.796
What?

10:02.830 --> 10:05.628
For the murder of
the pharmacist.

10:05.670 --> 10:08.389
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

10:18.410 --> 10:21.914
(game playing on TV)
So how long have you
known Derrick Rose?

10:21.950 --> 10:24.885
Are you really getting
jealous of Derrick Rose?

10:24.920 --> 10:26.956
How positively charming.

10:26.990 --> 10:29.879
I have a better average
from the free throw line.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.669
See? TV.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.394
I see that.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.660
Square knobs.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.737
You know, if it were between
you and Derrick Rose...

10:44.770 --> 10:46.704
Derrick Rose?

10:46.740 --> 10:48.332
Yeah. Sorry.

10:48.380 --> 10:51.247
A girl has to keep up
her standards.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.339
But you and me,
we're having fun, right?

10:53.380 --> 10:55.371
I am. Are you?

10:55.420 --> 10:57.786
That's why I'm still here.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.685
(ringing)

10:59.720 --> 11:01.984
(sighs)

11:02.020 --> 11:03.954
I have to get that.

11:03.990 --> 11:06.026
I know. Then do.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.327
Derrick would have
no problem with that.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.394
Yeah.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.091
They're being accused of murder.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.698
WILL: Who?

11:15.740 --> 11:16.707
Jonathan Murphy
and his girlfriend.

11:16.740 --> 11:19.106
Prescription drugs were traced
to a pharmacy

11:19.140 --> 11:20.471
that was burglarized last night.

11:20.510 --> 11:22.774
The pharmacist surprised
the burglar

11:22.810 --> 11:24.038
and was shot-- killed.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.105
Okay, I get it.
Kalinda's on it?

11:26.150 --> 11:27.378
Yeah, but I need backup.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.842
On my way.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.882
And you're
on your way.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.809
I'm sorry.
It's an important client.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.384
I wouldn't do this
for anyone.

11:35.420 --> 11:36.956
Have fun.

11:36.990 --> 11:39.185
Maybe I'll give Derrick a call.

11:39.230 --> 11:41.198
DIANE:
It's good that you called.

11:41.230 --> 11:43.494
We can find a better price
with the full floor.
All right.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.738
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.931
Who was that?

11:48.970 --> 11:50.733
Alicia.

11:50.770 --> 11:52.067
Did you ask her?

11:52.110 --> 11:55.409
No. It's about
Murphy/Gomes.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.375
Murphy's son is being
accused of murder.

11:58.410 --> 11:59.399
He what?

11:59.450 --> 12:01.771
Will is on his
way to help.

12:04.220 --> 12:07.712
Murphy/Gomes could mean
a lot if he came with us.

12:08.990 --> 12:10.184
We'll be in touch.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.481
It'll go fast.

12:11.530 --> 12:14.090
In this market?
I doubt it.

12:16.060 --> 12:17.220
We'll be fine.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.828
I know. I love you.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.189
I love you, too.

12:28.510 --> 12:30.239
We're holding them
for questioning.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.975
We haven't charged them yet.

12:32.010 --> 12:33.409
Yeah, well, either charge
them or let them go.

12:33.450 --> 12:34.269
Maybe you haven't heard.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.244
Murder one, the execution
of a robbery.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.485
With weak and
tangential evidence.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.851
The jars of prescription pills

12:40.890 --> 12:42.881
found in Alexis's room
had bar codes.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.022
These bar codes link them

12:44.060 --> 12:45.789
to the Colton
& Lowell Pharmacy,

12:45.830 --> 12:48.025
where Andrew Lightbox, a
hardworking American citizen,

12:48.060 --> 12:50.164
was murdered
at 11:00 last night.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.865
When the police subsequently
searched Jonathan Murphy's room,

12:54.900 --> 12:56.094
they found more of the same.

12:56.140 --> 12:58.563
Searched? Did the police
have a search warrant?

12:58.610 --> 13:00.271
Hey, it's a reunion.

13:00.310 --> 13:02.005
And, no, they didn't.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.143
They are campus police.

13:03.180 --> 13:04.477
They don't need
a search warrant

13:04.510 --> 13:07.047
to canvass any
on-campus dorm room.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.342
Yeah, that's right.
Get Kalinda on it.

13:08.380 --> 13:10.245
DIANE: Come on, Cary.
ALICIA: They ID'd

13:10.290 --> 13:11.484
the drug dealer as
one of Bishop's crew.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.010
Yes.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.518
All of these men
are members of Bishop's crew.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.528
They also all happen to be dead.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.488
Nice sleight of hand, Cary.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.521
Hey, I learned from the best.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.868
So, here's the thing--

13:26.900 --> 13:29.494
only one of your two clients
pulled the trigger.

13:29.540 --> 13:31.303
So I could charge them both,

13:31.340 --> 13:34.138
I could prosecute them both,
but I have a deal for you.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.968
Burglary for the first one
who turns on the other.

13:38.010 --> 13:40.319
Burglary, first offense--
eight months.

13:40.350 --> 13:43.114
Murder during the commission
of a robbery-- 25 years.

13:43.150 --> 13:45.141
Yep.

13:45.190 --> 13:46.589
First pie out of the oven.

13:46.620 --> 13:49.214
So, the question is,
who wants to get out of prison

13:49.260 --> 13:51.148
in time for their 22nd birthday?

13:51.190 --> 13:53.420
And who wants to get out
for their 48th?

13:59.070 --> 14:00.594
We play this out.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.868
Keep listening to Cary.

14:01.900 --> 14:02.935
Keep him talking.

14:02.970 --> 14:04.528
We don't say a word.

14:04.570 --> 14:05.969
The right to
remain silent

14:06.010 --> 14:07.500
does not mean the
right to not listen.

14:07.540 --> 14:10.247
And we'll see
what you can dig up.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.145
We should phone
Blake, too.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.614
We need to keep her
on the reservation.

14:14.650 --> 14:16.572
Alexis?_
Yes, Alexrs.

14:16.620 --> 14:18.349
You and Julius
represent her.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.119
Alicia and I
will take him.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.515
Cary's playing this
like the prisoner dilemma.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.324
One prisoner gets so paranoid
the other will flip,

14:25.360 --> 14:26.486
they both race to flip.

14:26.530 --> 14:27.929
But we keep in touch.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.052
We don't get paranoid.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.226
If we both remain silent,

14:30.270 --> 14:32.124
he has to make a case.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.991
And he doesn't have one.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.439
And Murphy's son?

14:36.470 --> 14:38.165
What if he's the triggerman?

14:40.180 --> 14:43.274
Well, I think you know
who we need to protect here.

14:46.180 --> 14:48.239
Is Alexis all right?

14:48.280 --> 14:49.474
She's fine.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.147
We're going to represent
both of you.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.384
Thank you.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.012
Thank you so much.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.029
Look, Jon,
your first instinct here

14:57.060 --> 14:58.687
will be to lie to us.

14:58.730 --> 15:01.619
Your second instinct

15:01.660 --> 15:04.367
will be to lie
to us, too.

15:04.400 --> 15:08.234
So we need your third instinct.

15:08.270 --> 15:10.966
We're not your confessors.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.159
We're not here to judge.

15:12.210 --> 15:15.509
We're your lawyers.

15:15.540 --> 15:19.203
We just need the truth in
order to know how to act.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.343
So what happened?

15:23.150 --> 15:25.710
Nothing.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.354
It was stupid.

15:27.390 --> 15:28.357
We heard about a place

15:28.390 --> 15:30.950
where you could go get something
to keep awake.

15:30.990 --> 15:33.493
So we went.

15:33.530 --> 15:35.395
For finals.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.318
A lot of kids
were doing it.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.262
He's lying.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.369
I don't know why.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.662
I don't think
they did it.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.361
He might be trying
to protect her.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.968
And she's protecting him.

15:46.010 --> 15:48.308
They're going to protect
each other right into prison.

15:52.580 --> 15:55.743
So how do you
know you're gay?

15:55.780 --> 15:59.409
You mean before or after
I fellated my first guy?

15:59.450 --> 16:02.749
I don't like that word.

16:02.790 --> 16:06.180
I'm sorry. Before or after
I fellated my first man?

16:07.660 --> 16:10.527
You _don't have to answer
If you don't want.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.096
I knew from a very young age.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.266
High school.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.700
So you think you were born gay?

16:18.740 --> 16:22.506
Do I think I was born gay?
Yes, I do think.

16:22.540 --> 16:23.609
What I don't understand

16:23.650 --> 16:26.505
is why it's so important
to say people were born gay.

16:26.550 --> 16:27.676
If it's so good,

16:27.720 --> 16:30.382
people should be allowed to
choose it, shouldn't they?

16:30.420 --> 16:31.717
They should think

16:31.750 --> 16:33.081
it wasn't forced on them.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.519
They would just prefer it.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.484
But it isn't about "should;"
it's about biology.

16:37.530 --> 16:41.193
Well, yes...
Well, I don't think it is.

16:41.230 --> 16:42.527
I think people want

16:42.560 --> 16:44.596
to think it is.

16:44.630 --> 16:47.190
Okay, my turn.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.800
Why do so many old people
read Reader's Digest?

16:49.840 --> 16:52.536
The big type.

16:52.570 --> 16:54.231
Isn't this fun?

16:54.280 --> 16:56.339
We're sharing deep truths.

16:58.450 --> 17:01.669
I saw Grace holding hands
with a girl from school.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.484
Oh... my God.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.817
You can make fun,

17:05.850 --> 17:07.283
but I think it's too early

17:07.320 --> 17:09.151
for her to know
if she's gay or not.

17:09.190 --> 17:11.124
I'm afraid she's making a choice
that she'll regret.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.752
Regret?

17:12.790 --> 17:14.758
Don't take it
personally.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.722
Sure. Why would I?

17:16.760 --> 17:19.228
Look, they were
holding hands, Jackie.

17:19.270 --> 17:20.498
Girls hold hands.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.791
In Grace's room.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.400
Girls hold hands in rooms.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.465
On her bed, after a sleepover.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.638
Let her through.
Thanks.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.352
I thought I'd just see
how you guys were...

17:40.390 --> 17:42.608
You don't have to tell
a story, all right?

17:42.660 --> 17:44.252
We're here to _show
you everything.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.155
The ASA says you'll
find it anyway.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.555
Okay, then,
show me everything.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.291
You need one of these to
get Into the lIbrary.

17:51.330 --> 17:52.661
Your client says
they were in there

17:52.700 --> 17:54.565
at 11:00-- the time
of the murder.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.261
I think he said
around 11:00.

17:56.300 --> 17:57.528
It doesn't matter.

17:57.570 --> 17:59.265
There's a computer
that keeps track

17:59.310 --> 18:00.800
of everyone entering
and exiting.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.831
Here's a copy for you.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.599
I'm guessing this is
not going to end well.

18:05.650 --> 18:07.447
Well, it does for me.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.539
Last time your client
was in the library

18:09.580 --> 18:10.615
was a week ago.

18:10.650 --> 18:11.719
Bye-bye, alibi.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.548
Who's that?

18:14.590 --> 18:16.251
Campus police.

18:16.290 --> 18:18.349
_ KALINDA:
Getting older every year.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.426
Is he the one
who found the pills?

18:20.460 --> 18:22.496
It was a legal search.

18:22.530 --> 18:23.827
I'm sure it was.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.828
Do you mind if I just
have a chat with him?

18:26.870 --> 18:29.737
Damn. I thought at least
their alibi would hold up.

18:29.770 --> 18:30.759
I'm talking to the campus cop.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.630
They're always good
for an infraction or two.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.900
WOMAN:
Mr. Gardner?
Yes?

18:34.940 --> 18:39.639
I'm Eliza Symanski,
Alexis's mother.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.319
DIANE: We're doing this
pro bono, ma'am-- free--

18:42.350 --> 18:44.614
because we have a relationship
with the Murphy family.

18:44.650 --> 18:47.813
It's serious, but we can't tell
how much is police overreach.

18:47.860 --> 18:48.918
Overreach?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.723
Are they overcharging?

18:50.760 --> 18:53.558
Was it just a drug charge
they're trying to inflate

18:53.600 --> 18:54.851
to a murder?
(gasps)

18:54.900 --> 18:56.891
ALICIA: Do you need
some water, ma'am?

18:56.930 --> 18:58.864
No, thank you.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.891
She's a good girl.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.589
She would never
do anything like that.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.868
DIANE:
That's good to know.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.470
WILL: Just know, Mrs. Symanski,
we're on the case.

19:06.510 --> 19:07.738
You could go with
a public defender,

19:07.780 --> 19:09.509
but we will put all our
resources into this.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.706
I think I will take that water.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.911
Certainly.

19:14.950 --> 19:17.942
At a certain point, you have
to wonder if this is right.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.639
Tricking that woman

19:19.690 --> 19:21.908
into thinking
you're on her side.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.951
Let me get this straight.

19:23.990 --> 19:26.879
You're criticizing us
for using tricks?

19:26.930 --> 19:29.819
I don't apologize for lying to
two punk kids who killed a man.

19:29.860 --> 19:31.919
Two punk kids-- really?
Have you looked at them?

19:31.970 --> 19:34.894
We've both dealt
with enough criminals

19:34.940 --> 19:37.659
to know the killers
look exactly like the victims.

19:39.510 --> 19:40.807
So you have a master key?

19:40.840 --> 19:42.933
Yep. All the campus cops do.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.868
So when you entered
Jonathan's dorm room,

19:44.910 --> 19:45.877
you were looking for drugs?

19:45.910 --> 19:46.979
Yes.

19:47.010 --> 19:48.841
Don't mind me.
I'll just sit here.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.644
Other students reported
prescription drugs

19:51.690 --> 19:53.453
being sold by
Mr. Murphy.

19:53.490 --> 19:54.957
Sold, not used?
Yes.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.514
Congratulations,
Kalinda.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.720
You just added a year
to their sentence.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.921
And where'd you find the drugs?

19:59.960 --> 20:00.699
There,

20:00.730 --> 20:03.665
under the bed.
KALINDA:
In there?

20:03.700 --> 20:04.962
Can you show me
how you found the drugs?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.639
Sure.

20:07.670 --> 20:11.868
Yeah, I come in the room,
I look around,

20:11.910 --> 20:13.673
I see the gym bag there.

20:13.710 --> 20:14.904
I zip it open,

20:14.940 --> 20:16.874
saw the drugs.

20:16.910 --> 20:19.549
You zipped open the gym bag?

20:19.580 --> 20:20.877
(sighs)
Yeah.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.944
Why?

20:21.980 --> 20:23.982
Search of the dorm room
was legal,

20:24.020 --> 20:26.887
but the moment you unzipped
Mr. Murphy's gym bag,

20:26.920 --> 20:29.684
the search
became Illegal.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.028
Better phone Cary.

20:31.060 --> 20:33.255
Thanks a lot.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.029
It's going to be a long night.

20:35.060 --> 20:37.051
Yeah, I got it.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.829
1410 probation for
the both of them.

20:43.870 --> 20:45.735
It's a technicality.

20:45.770 --> 20:47.499
You guys just
love saying that.

20:47.540 --> 20:49.531
The whole Constitution

20:49.580 --> 20:50.672
is a technicality.

20:50.710 --> 20:51.938
(chuckles)

20:51.980 --> 20:53.538
Okay.

20:53.580 --> 20:54.911
Three months.

20:54.950 --> 20:56.975
First one who flips
gets three months.

20:57.020 --> 20:59.909
Cary, think about it.
Why would we do that?

20:59.950 --> 21:01.918
Diane's in one room,
I'm in the other.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.882
You lost.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.921
Don't let your ego
do the thinking.

21:14.870 --> 21:17.930
So they're not
charging you?

21:17.970 --> 21:19.733
Excuse me?

21:19.770 --> 21:21.328
The, uh, law firm...

21:21.380 --> 21:23.974
Lockhart/Gardner,
they're not charging you

21:24.010 --> 21:24.977
for representing
your daughter?

21:25.010 --> 21:25.999
Yeah. Why?

21:26.050 --> 21:28.075
Did they tell you
I have a deal on the table?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.338
If your daughter
takes it,

21:30.390 --> 21:33.041
she gets three months probation
as opposed

21:33.090 --> 21:34.011
to 25 years.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.812
On the other hand,

21:35.860 --> 21:37.953
if their paying client
takes the three months,

21:37.990 --> 21:39.958
your daughter gets 25 years.

21:39.990 --> 21:43.665
So, that's a difficult
position to be in--

21:43.700 --> 21:44.928
representing both clients,

21:44.970 --> 21:48.030
especially when only one of them
can benefit from a plea bargain.

21:50.070 --> 21:52.732
I just want the best thing
for my daughter.

21:52.770 --> 21:53.998
I know,

21:54.040 --> 21:56.008
but they're trying to scare you

21:56.040 --> 21:58.907
by saying it's them
or a public defender,

21:58.950 --> 22:01.043
and there are respectable
law firms out there

22:01.080 --> 22:02.911
that do pro bono work.

22:02.950 --> 22:07.819
So, I could give you a name
if you want.

22:13.430 --> 22:14.795
No.

22:14.830 --> 22:16.354
Yep. You've just been fired.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.822
By who?

22:17.870 --> 22:20.020
Mrs. Symanski.

22:21.470 --> 22:24.109
I think it's for the best.

22:24.140 --> 22:26.062
Yeah, for the best,

22:26.110 --> 22:29.409
but thank you for all
your hard, selfless work.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.907
I'll take it from here.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.043
Eight months
to the first one who flips.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.071
Good night.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.879
(knocking)
Owen, it's me.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.820
You have my keys, remember?

22:43.860 --> 22:45.020
Hello.

22:45.060 --> 22:48.518
Hello.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.788
Having fun, are we?

22:49.830 --> 22:52.560
I have had a drink,
but I'm fine.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.897
I'm doing laundry.

22:53.940 --> 22:54.895
Okay.

22:57.970 --> 23:00.871
What have you done
to my mother...?

23:00.910 --> 23:02.639
No, no, that...

23:02.680 --> 23:04.807
that is _
your perception.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.910
Well, you know, I can't...
I can't help you with that.

23:07.950 --> 23:10.919
Oh, okay, yeah.
No, believe him and not me.

23:10.950 --> 23:12.781
That's fine.

23:12.820 --> 23:14.082
That is great.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.849
(sighs)

23:15.890 --> 23:18.779
Hey. How'd your thing go?

23:18.830 --> 23:21.924
Not well.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.120
Was that Kevin?

23:23.160 --> 23:25.924
Yeah. He told me
to tell you hello.

23:25.970 --> 23:28.097
I drank all your tequila.
When did you start

23:28.140 --> 23:29.869
drinking tequila,
anyway?

23:29.900 --> 23:31.561
You should go to him.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.976
To Kevin? No. Why?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.105
He didn't cheat on you, did he?

23:38.710 --> 23:40.575
(sighs)

23:40.620 --> 23:42.144
Just go to him
and say you're sorry.

23:42.180 --> 23:43.613
Yeah, well, what if I'm not?

23:43.650 --> 23:44.947
Lie and say that you are.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.946
Oh, come on, Alicia.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.787
We don't all have
to be like you.

23:48.820 --> 23:51.687
Not everybody's required
to be committed for life.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.698
Oh, really?

23:58.730 --> 24:00.937
The silent Alicia treatment.

24:00.970 --> 24:02.130
Really?

24:02.170 --> 24:05.003
Is that what we've
descended to already?

24:08.080 --> 24:10.469
Hey. Hey, hey!

24:10.510 --> 24:11.807
(chuckles)

24:11.850 --> 24:13.101
Not funny! Not funny!

24:13.150 --> 24:15.038
(laughs)
No!

24:20.020 --> 24:21.954
So, did you
save the world?

24:21.990 --> 24:24.049
No. Tomorrow.

24:24.090 --> 24:26.820
Oh, it's you.
(chuckles)

24:26.860 --> 24:27.895
Anything from Derrick?

24:27.930 --> 24:29.750
Nope. Rodney called.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.994
What'd he say?

24:31.030 --> 24:35.137
Derrick is out, and he heard
Lockhart/Gardner's breaking up.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.067
You're serious?

24:40.110 --> 24:41.634
Yeah, I'm serious.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.103
Diane Lockhart's been lining up
clients for a coup.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.108
I'm going back
to sleep now.

24:47.150 --> 24:49.516
Making little
kitten noises.

25:01.060 --> 25:04.791
CARY: That's blood, Jon,
on the floor of your car.

25:04.830 --> 25:05.660
We're testing it now,

25:05.700 --> 25:07.861
and my guess is,
it's going to come back

25:07.900 --> 25:09.834
as the blood of Mr. Lightbox,
the murdered pharmacist.

25:09.870 --> 25:11.064
Inadmissible, Cary,
and you know it.

25:11.110 --> 25:11.906
Fruit of the poisonous tree.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.874
The only reason you
searched the car

25:13.910 --> 25:14.729
is_because of an
Illegal search

25:14.780 --> 25:16.998
of our client's bag
in their dorm room.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.770
And yes, if this was strictly
about court, that would be true.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.072
But what you need to know

25:21.120 --> 25:22.872
is that we're closing in
on you two.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.888
WILK:
Then come back to us
when you've closed in,

25:24.920 --> 25:27.047
because this melodrama
IS getting old.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.558
We'll find the gun, Alexis,
then the deal goes away.

25:29.590 --> 25:31.182
Right now, it's eight months.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.118
Make it eight-month
probation and we'll talk.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.025
Then I'll just walk
across the hall,

25:35.060 --> 25:37.028
and I'll make the same
offer to your girlfriend.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.288
ALICIA: Then walk.
You wouldn't be here

25:38.330 --> 25:39.968
if they hadn't said
the same thing.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.889
Okay, but it's your life

25:42.940 --> 25:44.862
your lawyers
are gambling with, Jon.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.935
And here's... here's one
more thing you might consider:

25:46.970 --> 25:48.232
My boss
is Glenn Childs.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.929
He's running
for reelection.

25:49.980 --> 25:53.074
And he's received a fairly large
campaign contribution

25:53.110 --> 25:55.249
from Keith Murphy, the
father of your boyfriend.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.010
Now, who do you
think my boss

25:58.050 --> 25:59.142
would rather make a deal with,

25:59.190 --> 26:00.987
your or his campaign
contributor?

26:03.090 --> 26:05.285
So, if I were you,
I would jump at that,

26:05.330 --> 26:07.321
because how would that look
to the electorate?

26:07.360 --> 26:09.328
Glenn Childs making
a light plea offer

26:09.360 --> 26:12.090
to one of his largest
campaign contributors?

26:12.130 --> 26:14.064
Are you listening?

26:14.100 --> 26:15.636
I'm listening.

26:15.670 --> 26:18.264
You don't understand.

26:18.310 --> 26:23.031
Alexis won't turn on me,
and I won't turn on her.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.105
CARY:
Are you sure about that?

26:25.150 --> 26:27.072
Because I just came from him,

26:27.110 --> 26:29.078
and he has these
high-priced lawyers,

26:29.120 --> 26:31.338
and they seem to be
wearing him down.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.654
I don't believe you.

26:37.060 --> 26:39.119
Do you think love
can conquer all?

26:41.100 --> 26:44.365
Even a 25-year stretch?

26:57.680 --> 26:59.170
Well, that's good.

26:59.210 --> 27:00.768
Jonathan's _dad
just flew In.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.173
Maybe he can talk
to him.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.188
What's Kalinda doing?

27:04.220 --> 27:05.687
She's looking for the gun.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.312
(police siren wailing)

27:07.350 --> 27:10.217
I need you to keep something
confidential, Alicia.

27:10.260 --> 27:11.249
Okay.

27:11.290 --> 27:12.655
Can you do that?

27:12.690 --> 27:15.022
I... If you ask me to.

27:15.060 --> 27:17.051
I've come to respect you
mightily as a lawyer.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.068
Thank you.

27:19.100 --> 27:22.160
David Lee, Julius and I
are starting our own firm.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.338
We want you to come with us.

27:27.070 --> 27:29.777
As you can imagine,
this is very difficult.

27:29.810 --> 27:31.346
I have genuine feelings
for Will,

27:31.380 --> 27:33.348
but he and Bond
are taking the firm

27:33.380 --> 27:36.770
_ in a direction that leaves
little room for me-- a woman.

27:36.820 --> 27:39.345
Does Will know about this?

27:39.390 --> 27:41.358
That we're leaving? No.

27:41.390 --> 27:45.053
And I know you two have
a close relationship.

27:45.090 --> 27:47.820
That's why I'm asking you--
whichever way you choose to go,

27:47.860 --> 27:51.159
you must keep this conversation
conﬁdenﬁaL

27:52.330 --> 27:55.128
(door opens)

27:55.170 --> 27:57.138
He's having his third instincts.

27:57.170 --> 27:59.263
And here we come.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.916
Alexis has a friend.

28:11.950 --> 28:14.180
Jenni, uh, Salerno.

28:14.220 --> 28:15.255
Someone from
the neighborhood.

28:15.290 --> 28:16.359
She phoned.
She was in trouble.

28:16.390 --> 28:20.156
She needed to be picked up,
so... so we drove her.

28:20.190 --> 28:23.159
She had blood on her shirt
and her shoes,

28:23.200 --> 28:24.326
and she had a gun.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.498
Did you touch the gun?
Yes.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.269
We hoped to get rid of it.

28:32.370 --> 28:35.271
Okay, I need you
to tell me exactly:

28:35.310 --> 28:37.744
Where did you
get rid of it?

28:37.780 --> 28:41.170
Hey, Blake, we need you
to locate a Jenni Salerno.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.814
Yeah.

28:43.850 --> 28:46.284
With any luck, he
tossed it in the water.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.459
ALICIA: I don't think he's been
having much luck up until now.

28:48.490 --> 28:49.809
WILL:
Where's you car?

29:10.210 --> 29:12.201
Come on in.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.184
Yep, they're doing
a quadrant search.

29:18.220 --> 29:20.415
He said it was right up
over here.

29:31.830 --> 29:35.061
So what do we do?

29:35.100 --> 29:36.533
It's illegal to take it.

29:36.570 --> 29:38.299
So we just leave it?

29:38.340 --> 29:40.069
Hope maybe the police
don't find it?

29:40.110 --> 29:42.305
(sighs)

29:42.340 --> 29:45.275
It's not technically
part of the crime scene.

29:45.310 --> 29:47.574
The police haven't found
any evidence yet.

29:47.610 --> 29:51.239
And who's to say this gun
was the gun?

29:54.890 --> 29:58.326
We took it into our possession.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.952
We were in a crime-ridden
neighborhood.

29:59.990 --> 30:03.096
We were worried someone
would find the gun

30:03.130 --> 30:05.860
before the police
were contacted.

30:06.870 --> 30:09.088
It's evidence.

30:09.140 --> 30:13.338
We can't destroy, move,
alter, conceal evidence.

30:13.370 --> 30:15.270
So that's it, then.

30:15.310 --> 30:17.403
Yes.

30:21.450 --> 30:23.372
WILL:
Pull over here.

30:23.420 --> 30:24.910
ALICIA:
Why?

30:24.950 --> 30:26.383
A thought.

30:27.420 --> 30:29.115
Hey.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.982
Hey to you.

30:33.030 --> 30:34.258
We're not selling.

30:34.300 --> 30:37.019
No, we, uh...

30:37.060 --> 30:38.994
back by the rocks
over there,

30:39.030 --> 30:40.395
we just found a gun.

30:40.430 --> 30:43.035
We didn't know if it
was one of yours. Maybe not.

30:44.070 --> 30:45.606
Okay.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.530
Was that legal?

30:49.580 --> 30:52.902
That was
on the line.
Uh-huh.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.082
She said that? She lying.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.008
KALINDA: They also said
that you wanted them

31:00.050 --> 31:01.915
to get rid of your gun

31:01.960 --> 31:03.951
and that you sold them
some prescription pills.

31:03.990 --> 31:05.218
What?

31:05.260 --> 31:07.649
It was the opposite. I bought
some of those pills from them.

31:07.690 --> 31:11.091
Answer the question!
Thursday night,

31:11.130 --> 31:12.495
11:00 pm, where were you?

31:12.530 --> 31:15.135
I was at a ATM machine, okay?!

31:15.170 --> 31:17.331
Geez! I was getting
out money!

31:17.370 --> 31:19.235
Empty your pockets.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.576
Surveillance photos
of Jenni at 11:10 pm.

31:27.610 --> 31:29.510
There's no way
she would have gotten

31:29.550 --> 31:31.245
from the murder scene
to the ATM machine.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.518
So Jonathan and Alexis,

31:32.550 --> 31:33.642
they're lying.

31:33.690 --> 31:36.113
They broke in,
the two of them.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.457
The pharmacist surprised them.

31:37.490 --> 31:39.981
Alexis saw him raising his gun
to shoot Jonathan,

31:40.030 --> 31:42.555
so she struggled with him
and killed him.

31:42.600 --> 31:46.263
Later, they told
Jenni what happened.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.393
Alexis killed him
to save Jonathan.

31:50.670 --> 31:52.365
So we need him to take the plea.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.935
We need him to turn on her.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.278
How are we
going to do that?

31:57.310 --> 32:01.576
The one reason he hasn't turned
on her yet: love.

32:04.390 --> 32:07.109
You're going to break them up?

32:11.260 --> 32:13.421
No one said it would be pretty.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.561
WILL: I have a question
in my mind, they started
pushing her hard...

32:20.600 --> 32:21.567
He's here.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.567
Mr. Murphy.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.067
Where's my son?

32:24.110 --> 32:25.259
He's being questioned.
I'm Will Gardner.

32:25.310 --> 32:26.368
We spoke on the phone.

32:26.410 --> 32:27.536
All right, Diane,
what's going on?

32:27.570 --> 32:29.470
The state's attorney
made an offer:

32:29.510 --> 32:31.569
four m_onths_in trade
for his testimony.

32:31.610 --> 32:32.577
Against her?

32:32.610 --> 32:35.044
Yes. It looks like they
burglarized the pharmacy

32:35.080 --> 32:37.310
together, but she was the one
who shot the pharmacist.

32:37.350 --> 32:39.341
Um, maybe we should...

32:41.460 --> 32:43.451
(workplace murmurings)

32:45.530 --> 32:47.452
How long has Jonathan
been dating Alexis?

32:47.490 --> 32:49.128
Dating? Half a
year, maybe. Why?

32:49.160 --> 32:51.128
The reason Jonathan has refused

32:51.170 --> 32:53.593
to take a plea
is his concern for her.

32:53.630 --> 32:56.736
We need him to
rethink that concern.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.066
What was your name again?

33:00.110 --> 33:02.670
Will Gardner.
Do you have a plan
for doing that?

33:02.710 --> 33:05.577
Yes, but it would help
if we had some ammunition.

33:05.610 --> 33:06.702
(sighs)

33:06.750 --> 33:08.274
He e-mails regularly
with my wife.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.777
About a month ago,
he told her he couldn't sleep.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.515
He was... he...

33:12.550 --> 33:14.552
he thought Alexis
was seeing another student.

33:14.590 --> 33:16.148
_WILL: Did he
give you a name?

33:16.190 --> 33:17.452
MURPHY: He overheard
her talking to someone

33:17.490 --> 33:19.026
on the phone named Neil.
That's all I know.

33:19.060 --> 33:20.220
That's enough.
I'll get on it.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.093
You think this
is a mistake?

33:23.130 --> 33:25.121
I can't tell what's
a mistake anymore.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.398
He didn't do it.

33:26.430 --> 33:28.466
Yes, but she did
it to save him.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.468
WILL: Damn.
It's the kid with the gun.

33:33.610 --> 33:35.339
Hey, that's kind of
fortuitous, huh?

33:35.380 --> 33:37.336
This kid just showed up
with the murder weapon.

33:37.380 --> 33:39.598
Really?
Yeah.

33:39.650 --> 33:43.108
Turns out he's a sophomore at
CSC and he just found the gun,

33:43.150 --> 33:45.345
called it _in
to the police.

33:46.390 --> 33:48.085
That's a real
Good Samaritan.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.315
(chuckles) It's a good thing
he pointed us towards the gun

33:50.360 --> 33:52.328
because we never
would have found it.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.191
Yeah, it's a good thing.
Yeah.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.323
Not only that,
but we found prints on it.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.328
The lab is expediting them,
so we should know

33:58.370 --> 34:00.361
in a couple hours who
those prints belong to.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.789
So, it's a good time
to make that deal with us.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.035
Yeah, we'll get back to you.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.172
CARY: Do you really think
he's going to hold out

34:09.210 --> 34:10.802
much longer?

34:10.840 --> 34:15.345
He's negotiating with us right
now to get the plea down.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.712
I don't believe you.

34:18.750 --> 34:21.753
I love him,
and he loves me.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.088
Well, I hope you're right,

34:26.130 --> 34:28.325
because I just found
the murder weapon.

34:29.330 --> 34:30.752
And my guess is,

34:30.800 --> 34:32.392
it has both your
prints on it.

34:32.430 --> 34:33.692
WILK:
Let me talk to her.

34:38.170 --> 34:40.206
I know the lavwers
over there, Alexis.

34:40.240 --> 34:41.730
I know how they work.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.271
They're doing what I'm
going to do right now:

34:44.310 --> 34:46.449
plead with you to
take this deal.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.539
I know you think
love lasts forever.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.116
It doesn't.

34:50.150 --> 34:53.449
Love wilts in the
face of 25 years,

34:53.490 --> 34:56.584
and then it'll just be
you and a prison cell.

34:56.620 --> 34:59.680
Listen to me, please.

35:04.230 --> 35:06.118
Here's your Neil--
Neil Osiola.

35:06.170 --> 35:07.467
She phoned him three
times in one night,

35:07.500 --> 35:09.138
five times the
following week.

35:09.170 --> 35:10.330
Good. Great.

35:10.370 --> 35:11.462
No, it's not
what you think.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.262
She's not cheating on him.

35:13.310 --> 35:14.572
Doesn't matter. _
We can leverage this.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.532
No, I phoned him.
He's her OB/GYN.

35:17.580 --> 35:18.842
And she's phoning

35:18.880 --> 35:20.472
her OB/GYN
'cause she's pregnant.

35:20.510 --> 35:22.375
(sighs)

35:28.920 --> 35:30.785
WILL: Look, she phoned
him seven times--

35:30.820 --> 35:31.855
three in one night.

35:31.890 --> 35:33.289
Neil Osiola.

35:33.330 --> 35:34.524
Neil Osiola there.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.652
You see?

35:35.700 --> 35:38.191
That's the woman you're
throwing away your future for.

35:38.230 --> 35:40.869
That's the man she's
been cheating with.

35:48.610 --> 35:50.601
(door closes)

35:55.820 --> 35:57.811
(workplace murmurings)

36:06.560 --> 36:09.222
Sorry I have to be tough.

36:09.260 --> 36:11.364
People decide their future
in a heartbeat,

36:11.400 --> 36:13.618
and they don't know how
important that heartbeat is.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.535
Wilk's doing the same thing
in his room.

36:15.570 --> 36:17.629
I understand.

36:17.670 --> 36:19.900
I just don't
have to like it,

36:19.940 --> 36:21.703
but I understand.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.346
MURPHY:
Do it, Jon.

36:24.380 --> 36:25.938
It's not right, Dad.

36:25.980 --> 36:28.574
No, what's not right
is having your mom

36:28.620 --> 36:31.316
visit you in prison
for the next 25 years.

36:31.350 --> 36:34.319
What's not right
is throwing away your future.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.419
I can't turn on her.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.553
You can, son.

36:38.590 --> 36:40.524
She did it.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.289
She killed a man.

36:42.330 --> 36:44.594
She killed a man to save me.

36:44.630 --> 36:47.224
The only reason we were
there was because of me.

36:47.270 --> 36:48.931
And you won't walk
away from that.

36:48.970 --> 36:50.392
You'll be sentenced
for burglary.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.566
You'll have a record.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.464
Dad, I love her.

36:57.010 --> 36:59.240
Do you love me?

37:00.650 --> 37:02.641
Then, please...

37:02.680 --> 37:04.682
do this.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.292
Get him in here.

37:16.330 --> 37:18.696
(door opening)

37:18.730 --> 37:20.721
WILL:
Cary. Cary.

37:23.740 --> 37:26.402
Have you made a decision?

37:29.710 --> 37:31.541
I want to confess.

37:31.580 --> 37:32.774
(sighs)

37:52.370 --> 37:54.361
ALEXIS:
No!

37:54.400 --> 37:55.560
(door opens)

37:55.600 --> 37:56.589
ALEXIS: No!
Alexis!

37:56.640 --> 37:58.437
Alexis, it's okay!

37:58.470 --> 37:59.562
ALEXIS:
No!

37:59.610 --> 38:00.702
Let me out!

38:00.740 --> 38:03.675
Let me out!
Let me out!

38:03.710 --> 38:05.746
Hold on.
Let me out!

38:05.780 --> 38:07.839
Let me out!
Let me out, please!

38:07.880 --> 38:08.847
(opens door)

38:08.880 --> 38:11.075
Please. Why?

38:11.120 --> 38:12.712
Why did you do it?

38:12.750 --> 38:14.581
We're having a baby.

38:14.620 --> 38:16.759
(Alexis sobbing)

38:18.120 --> 38:19.724
I can't have
you lnSIde.
No!

38:19.760 --> 38:21.455
Look, you did this
to protect me.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.797
That's why I'm
doing this.

38:22.830 --> 38:24.821
No.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.504
No.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.698
ALEXIS:
No!

38:35.710 --> 38:39.498
(sobbin :
N0! N3!)

38:43.780 --> 38:45.441
DIANE:
I understand.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.640
Now I do.

38:47.690 --> 38:49.681
Thank you.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.821
That was Murphy?

38:54.860 --> 38:56.851
Yes.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.864
He wants_another firm
to handle his son's appeal.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.867
He wants to take
his business elsewhere.

39:06.910 --> 39:09.572
And he's going
with you?

39:13.910 --> 39:15.673
With me?

39:15.720 --> 39:18.439
To your new firm.

39:21.690 --> 39:23.658
You want to have this out now?

39:23.690 --> 39:25.658
We're both here.

39:25.690 --> 39:27.681
Who told you? Alicia?

39:29.860 --> 39:32.693
No. She didn't tell me.

39:32.730 --> 39:34.869
In fact, I didn't even know
she already knew.

39:34.900 --> 39:37.494
I've asked her to join me.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.736
And she's considering it?

39:43.780 --> 39:45.577
I think so.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.799
Who else?

39:47.850 --> 39:50.774
Why, so you can weed out
the betrayers?

39:50.820 --> 39:51.809
You should have told me, Diane.

39:51.850 --> 39:53.488
If I was considering this,

39:53.520 --> 39:54.555
I would have
told you.

39:54.590 --> 39:55.955
Are you serious?

39:55.990 --> 39:58.458
You and Bond have been plotting
for months...

39:58.490 --> 39:59.787
Oh, my God, you're paranoid.
And I'm right.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.889
Tell me I'm not right.
No, you know what?
I'm through telling you.

40:01.930 --> 40:04.694
We have not made one single
move against you, Diane.

40:04.730 --> 40:05.822
Not one.
You said you never knew Blake.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.497
Kalinda found out--

40:07.530 --> 40:09.589
you and Blake
go back for years.

40:09.640 --> 40:10.868
And you and Bond
have been systematically

40:10.900 --> 40:11.662
turning the equity partners
against me.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.803
You are only happy
when you think

40:13.840 --> 40:15.876
people are lined up against you.

40:15.910 --> 40:17.605
So have it.

40:17.640 --> 40:18.948
Happy birthday.

40:18.980 --> 40:21.619
It's my present
to you.

40:21.650 --> 40:23.914
Gorge on your own paranoia,
but don't come in tomorrow.

40:23.950 --> 40:25.611
This is my firm, as well.

40:25.650 --> 40:26.787
No, it isn't!

40:28.860 --> 40:31.954
I'm going to have guards
outside your office doors,

40:31.990 --> 40:35.494
and I'm gathering
the equity partners.

40:35.530 --> 40:36.849
To vote me out.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.061
Tell me my concerns
weren't real.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.739
You made your concerns real.

40:47.970 --> 40:49.938
(door opens)

40:49.980 --> 40:51.948
I'm in here.

40:51.980 --> 40:53.709
You're up late.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.945
Yeah. (sighs)

40:58.590 --> 41:00.012
I'm eating
Halloween candy.

41:00.050 --> 41:01.950
Do you want some?

41:01.990 --> 41:03.059
No. I'm good.

41:07.830 --> 41:10.151
I'm never going
to find love.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.027
What do you mean?

41:14.070 --> 41:16.732
I'm hard to live with.

41:16.770 --> 41:18.761
I get sick of people.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.801
They get on my nerves.

41:20.840 --> 41:21.875
You called Kevin.

41:21.910 --> 41:23.639
I did.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.944
I apologized.

41:25.980 --> 41:27.948
I was very convincing.

41:27.980 --> 41:30.972
I even... convinced myself.

41:31.020 --> 41:32.783
But he said it's over.

41:34.020 --> 41:35.180
Oh, Owen.

41:35.220 --> 41:37.757
It's all right.

41:37.790 --> 41:41.055
Scary thing is that
I felt relieved.

41:41.090 --> 41:42.751
I don't know.

41:42.800 --> 41:46.759
Love just doesn't seem
to last very long for me.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.166
They should put
you in a museum.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.838
Thanks.

41:50.870 --> 41:52.963
No. It's not, um...

41:53.010 --> 41:56.969
No, it's just this
ability you have.

41:57.010 --> 42:01.003
How... how do you make
love outlast passion?

42:02.180 --> 42:03.818
Is that what I do?

42:03.850 --> 42:06.045
I don't know.
You tell me.

42:08.760 --> 42:12.787
I think it's not just
about the heart, Owen.

42:12.830 --> 42:17.529
I think, sometimes,
the heart needs... steering.

42:19.770 --> 42:21.931
I thought you were going
to say something profound.

42:21.970 --> 42:24.837
(laughs)
What was wrong with that?

42:24.870 --> 42:28.306
"The heart needs...
steering."

42:28.340 --> 42:31.741
(both laughing)

42:31.780 --> 42:33.771
It's late.

42:35.780 --> 42:37.816
I'm going to stay here
for a couple of days.

42:37.850 --> 42:38.942
Okay.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.878
I mean, you can say no.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.785
Can I?
No.

42:42.820 --> 42:43.809
Okay.

42:43.860 --> 42:47.125
So, Owen, why don't you
stay here for a few days?

42:47.160 --> 42:49.128
If you insist.

42:52.230 --> 42:54.164
Will you make
cooing sounds

42:54.200 --> 42:57.567
so that I feel like everything's
going to be all right?

42:59.940 --> 43:01.976
(makes light
humming sounds)
