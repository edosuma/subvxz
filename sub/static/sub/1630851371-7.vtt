This is, like, you know,
a new challenge,

05:33.292 --> 05:37.294
you know, to continue to just
broaden my range as a performer,

05:37.338 --> 05:40.881
- and I had so much fun.
- Yeah!

05:40.924 --> 05:44.092
Ahem.

05:44.127 --> 05:46.928
Hey, I didn't
see you there.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.973
Oh, it's quite all right.
I'm easy to miss.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.851
I'm only three inches tall.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.353
Can I ask who you are?

05:54.396 --> 05:57.606
I mean, please don't tell me
you're another wild card act.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.358
Nope, I'm miss masky.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.193
I'm here to help out
the viewers at home

06:01.236 --> 06:03.153
by giving them extra clues.

06:03.197 --> 06:06.239
Oh, wow. Well, are you sure
you're here to help?

06:06.283 --> 06:07.949
'cause last year,
we had a chicken

06:07.951 --> 06:09.284
who said they were here to help.

06:09.328 --> 06:11.787
Turned out to just be
really annoying to everyone,

06:11.830 --> 06:13.789
and then turned out
to be donnie walberg.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.040
Ha! I'm serious!

06:15.084 --> 06:18.251
I'm just your friendly
neighborhood clue-holic,

Oh, well, nice
to meet you, miss masky.

06:25.302 --> 06:29.429
Pleasure's all mine, handsome.
Oops. I mean, mr. Cannon.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.057
Nah, handsome is fine.
Please call me that.

06:32.101 --> 06:34.601
Or nick.
But definitely not mr. Cannon.

06:34.645 --> 06:37.354
Handsome nick if you want.
You know what? I gotta go.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.022
I'll check you later,
miss masky.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.024
Bye, nick.

06:42.653 --> 06:46.196
Now, before we continue
the all-time countdown,

06:46.198 --> 06:48.907
let's reveal brand-new clues
and unseen footage

06:48.951 --> 06:50.951
from some of the masks
still battling

06:50.953 --> 06:54.496
to go head-to-head
in our prize fight finale.

06:55.958 --> 06:59.126

I've only been here
for one show, but, oh, boy.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.257
"if I were a boy" was a pretty
great first performance.

07:05.300 --> 07:10.345
♪ I would listen to her

07:10.389 --> 07:15.851
♪ 'cause I know how it felt

07:15.894 --> 07:17.853
I'm getting
the boy band vibes again.

07:17.896 --> 07:21.314
I think I put a bug in the
panel's ear about who I may be.

07:21.358 --> 07:25.318
- ( whispering )
- so, for my next song,

07:25.362 --> 07:28.738
what if I were a boy bander
like they think I am?

07:28.782 --> 07:34.244
<i> So I'm gonna sing a fast-paced</i>
<i> group number... Solo.</i>

07:37.833 --> 07:40.584
There's a reason why I said no
to "dancing with the stars."

07:40.627 --> 07:42.085

07:42.129 --> 07:44.421

<i> even bigger with my next song.</i>

23:01.089 --> 23:03.130
So let's just walk you
through, like, placement.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.467
You're gonna start
on just the bottom step.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.929
Do you want to start up there?

23:09.931 --> 23:12.089
<i> And I'm going to</i>
<i> keep aiming higher</i>

23:12.100 --> 23:14.225
<i> until I reach the top, okurr?</i>

23:14.268 --> 23:17.812
I'll never reach
the top of anything,

23:17.855 --> 23:22.566
but you can step up with this
sneaky clue to bull's identity.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.237

but my next performance

24:16.747 --> 24:20.291

- Yes, sir.

24:25.923 --> 24:28.215

24:28.217 --> 24:29.917
- I'll give it a go.
- Okay.

24:29.927 --> 24:33.262
All right, I'm up for anything.
If it works and it's yippee--

24:33.306 --> 24:37.266
it's a lot of work
being the wildest wild card.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.851

24:38.895 --> 24:42.438

24:44.650 --> 24:46.066
This shark is big,

24:46.110 --> 24:50.237

my already limited
dancing ability.

25:28.945 --> 25:31.403

25:32.990 --> 25:36.200
Choreographers had very low
expectations of my dancing,

25:36.244 --> 25:40.204

we've never done before--
"masked singer" duets.

All right, before we reveal
which performance is number one,

30:23.405 --> 30:26.156

<i>...We've really learned that</i>

30:37.753 --> 30:40.254
Though we do have separate
dressing rooms, of course,

30:40.297 --> 30:44.466

31:19.169 --> 31:20.711

31:20.754 --> 31:21.837
<i> Thankfully, we said yes,</i>

31:22.172 --> 31:25.591

Welcome back to

super all-time countdown.

38:40.027 --> 38:45.405
So far, we've heard the nine

39:03.633 --> 39:07.052

39:07.095 --> 39:10.347
<i> Behold beach ball.</i>

39:10.390 --> 39:12.349
I've been eyeing
the other singers,

39:12.392 --> 39:14.893
and it's time
for them to bounce.

39:14.936 --> 39:17.520
<i> I'm here to bring the party,</i>
<i> the good vibes,</i>

39:17.564 --> 39:19.522

39:25.364 --> 39:28.740
<i> Literally anyone</i>

39:28.784 --> 39:32.702
<i> It started</i>
<i> with a computer model</i>
<i> of 12 triangular pieces,</i>

39:32.746 --> 39:35.330
<i> which were assembled</i>
<i> into a six-foot sphere.</i>

39:35.374 --> 39:37.248
<i> A giant vinyl beach ball</i>
<i> covering</i>

39:37.292 --> 39:39.834
<i> was painstakingly fitted</i>
<i> over the form,</i>

39:39.878 --> 39:43.797
<i> then a mouth and jaw</i>
<i> apparatus built inside</i>
<i> for puppeteering.</i>

39:43.840 --> 39:46.591
<i> We've never seen anything</i>
<i> like beach ball.</i>

39:46.635 --> 39:51.096

But first,
here's a massive clue,

39:53.100 --> 39:54.724
and it's not for the birds.

39:54.768 --> 40:00.355
A beach ball and my name
are actually a perfect match.

40:00.399 --> 40:02.148
Bye-bye for now!

40:02.192 --> 40:06.152
Wow, that beach ball

42:26.336 --> 42:28.878
And, you know,
a lot of my peers did
and they get accepted.

42:28.880 --> 42:33.341
This helped me get my voice
out there even more,
and I appreciate you guys.
