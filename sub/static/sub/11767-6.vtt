17:59.699 --> 18:01.000
HOW DO? [ CLICKS TONGUE ]

18:01.000 --> 18:02.412
WHAT? NICE!

18:02.412 --> 18:03.913
SWEET! HELLO, BEAUTIFUL.

18:03.913 --> 18:05.415
HI THERE, LITTLE LADY.

18:05.415 --> 18:07.377
UHH! EASY, BABE.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.669
YOU ARE ACTING LIKE
A REAL JACKASS, TOM!

18:09.669 --> 18:12.132
THIS ISN'T YOU!
YES, IT IS. I'M DR. STUD.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.713
NO! NO, YOU'RE NOT!

18:13.713 --> 18:16.216
YOU'RE NEIGHBOR TOM,
AND NEIGHBOR TOM IS SUPER WEIRD

18:16.216 --> 18:18.138
BUT HE'S ALSO REALLY SWEET.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.769
AND HE'S FUN!

18:19.769 --> 18:22.182
AND THAT'S WHY EVERYONE
IN OUR GANG REALLY LOVES HIM.

18:22.182 --> 18:25.355
THE GANG IS NOT GOING TO LOVE
THIS NEW TOM.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.147
SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.569
DO YOU WANNA BE A SKEEVY JACKASS
OUT THERE, PLAYING THE FIELD?

18:29.569 --> 18:31.151
OR DO YOU WANNA BE
THE SWEET GUY THAT HAS

18:31.151 --> 18:33.283
A GREAT GROUP OF FRIENDS
THAT REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM?

18:33.283 --> 18:35.535
Woman: HI!

18:35.535 --> 18:37.407
THAT'S MY 6:00. I GOTTA JET.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.912
THAT IS NOT HOW I THOUGHT
THIS WOULD END. [ SIGHS ]

18:46.206 --> 18:47.797
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

18:47.797 --> 18:51.841
GRAYSON, I'M SORRY FOR HIJACKING
THE "S.S. PRISSY-PANTS."

18:51.841 --> 18:54.554
AT FIRST, I LOVED
CRUSHING YOUR SPIRIT.

18:54.554 --> 18:55.965
I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT
THE STUPID SANCTUARY.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.887
I JUST LOVED
FIGHTING WITH YOU.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.809
IS THIS YOUR PSYCHOTIC WAY
OF SAYING

18:59.809 --> 19:01.351
THAT YOU LOVE BATTLING ME

19:01.351 --> 19:03.142
BECAUSE YOU ENJOY
DOING STUFF WITH ME,

19:03.142 --> 19:05.144
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE FRIENDS?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.856
WASN'T REALLY GOING THERE.

19:06.856 --> 19:10.730
WHAT I LOVE IS THE THRILL
OF SAVAGELY DUKING IT OUT

19:10.730 --> 19:12.572
WITH A WORTHY ADVERSARY.

19:12.572 --> 19:14.534
I JUST DON'T HAVE MUCH OF THAT
THESE DAYS.

19:14.534 --> 19:17.737
I GUESS I'M BORED. I NEED
A NEW CHALLENGE IN MY LIFE.

19:19.329 --> 19:21.701
I FIXED YOUR STRING.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.455
Man: в™Є TELLS ME NOTHING в™Є

19:25.455 --> 19:26.916

19:29.339 --> 19:31.381
ELLIE, SERIOUSLY.

19:31.381 --> 19:33.923
JULES, I CAN'T HANDLE
ANOTHER INTERVIEW.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.216
I'M TEARING THROUGH
ALL MY GOOD SHIRTS.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.928
IT'S NOT AN INTERVIEW.
IT'S JUST A SALES PITCH.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.140
COME ON,
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT. GO.

19:41.140 --> 19:44.103

19:44.103 --> 19:46.436
I'M MOTIVATED, PASSIONATE,

19:46.436 --> 19:49.939
AND I CAN DO THIS JOB
AS WELL AS ANYONE IN THE WORLD.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.443
ELLIE...

19:53.443 --> 19:55.525
I WANNA BE
A STAY-AT-HOME DAD.

19:55.525 --> 19:57.196
в™Є THROUGH THE RUINS в™Є

19:57.196 --> 19:59.779
OF COURSE, THIS MEANS YOU WOULD
HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK.

19:59.779 --> 20:01.991
в™Є TRYING TO SAVE IT в™Є

20:01.991 --> 20:03.373
LET'S DO IT.

THE BRONZER --

20:32.942 --> 20:36.776
IT, UH, COMES IN A 16-OUNCE
OR DOE IT ALSO COME IN A 64?

20:38.318 --> 20:39.859
JULES.

20:39.859 --> 20:41.701
TOM, WE WERE JUST
ALL SITTING IN MY KITCHEN,

20:41.701 --> 20:43.783
AND I WANTED TO INVITE YOU
TO COME BY.

20:43.783 --> 20:45.665
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN SO LONG.

20:45.665 --> 20:47.707
