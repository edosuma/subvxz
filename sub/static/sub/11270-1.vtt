00:39.720 --> 00:41.760
How about a beer, chief?

00:43.641 --> 00:45.884
How about an ID?

00:46.853 --> 00:48.893
An ID?

00:50.441 --> 00:52.019
That's very flattering!

00:52.902 --> 00:54.646
Wait till I tell the missus.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.739
Military ID.

01:01.871 --> 01:05.572
First Sergeant Walter Keller,
born 1944.

01:06.251 --> 01:08.328
That makes you 38.

01:09.130 --> 01:11.668
- Must've fought in Vietnam.
- Yeah.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.050
- What was it like?
- It was gross.

01:16.013 --> 01:19.596
Yeah, that's what they say.
War is gross.

01:20.184 --> 01:22.224
I'm sorry, soldier.

01:23.939 --> 01:25.848
This is the thanks we get.

02:38.068 --> 02:40.310
Sumner, this is crazy.

02:40.446 --> 02:42.688
Diane, we're about to be married.

02:42.824 --> 02:46.193
Married! Congratulations!
Let's celebrate with a drink.

02:47.454 --> 02:49.114
I think not.

02:49.248 --> 02:50.577
I give it six months.

02:53.211 --> 02:56.331
Perhaps we won't have children
right away.

02:57.132 --> 03:00.834
- Come on. Let's sit here.
- We have a plane to catch.

03:00.970 --> 03:06.096
I insist you have my grandmother's
antique gold wedding ring.

03:06.226 --> 03:11.222
Didn't you say it's still on your
ex-wife's finger? I don't need it.

03:11.357 --> 03:15.937
- You're enough for me.
- True. But symbols are important.

03:16.071 --> 03:20.615
Let me call Barbara and see if
she's home. The phone's back here.

03:20.743 --> 03:25.287
As long as we're here,
let's celebrate with some champagne.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.846
Hello? Sam?

03:43.395 --> 03:44.854
Are you Sam?

03:44.980 --> 03:47.020
- Yes.
- Yes, he's here.

03:47.150 --> 03:48.395
Someone named Vicki.

03:48.526 --> 03:50.151
No.

03:51.363 --> 03:54.317
No, she knows you're here.
I told her you're here.

03:54.450 --> 03:55.992
Well...

03:56.744 --> 03:58.654
Now, look...

04:00.040 --> 04:03.456
I'm sorry, I was wrong.
He had to step out.

04:03.586 --> 04:04.665
Where?

04:06.297 --> 04:09.749
Well, I think what happened is he...

04:11.345 --> 04:13.967
...he had... to go to mime class.

04:18.937 --> 04:21.559
Yes, I'll take a message.

04:26.279 --> 04:27.857
You're welcome.

04:28.615 --> 04:32.744
- Well?
- You're a magnificent pagan beast.

04:32.870 --> 04:34.828
Thanks. What's the message?

04:39.086 --> 04:41.209
Listen, I didn't like doing that.

04:41.339 --> 04:45.633
I'm sorry. If I didn't own
this place, I'd fire me on the spot.

04:45.761 --> 04:48.430
For lying for me,
I'll buy you your first drink.

04:50.141 --> 04:52.679
I'd like a bottle
of your best champagne.

04:52.811 --> 04:54.850
It wasn't that great a lie.

04:55.522 --> 04:59.473
- No, we'll pay for it.
- We're on our way to get married.

04:59.610 --> 05:03.062
Then this is on me. Congratulations.

05:03.198 --> 05:05.985
Barbara was home.
She said I can come over.

05:06.118 --> 05:08.027
Well, do you want me to go with you?

05:08.162 --> 05:10.736
No, it could get a trifle sticky.

05:10.874 --> 05:14.919
Besides, if she saw the dazzling
beauty who's about to succeed her,

05:15.045 --> 05:16.919
it would break her heart again.

05:17.047 --> 05:19.087
Sumner, I'm not beautiful.

05:19.217 --> 05:20.759
Blasphemy.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.341
So where's the ceremony gonna be?

05:23.472 --> 05:26.888
- Tomorrow, in Barbados.
- Nice.

05:27.018 --> 05:30.601
I'm Dr Sumner Sloane, Professor
of World Literature at the U.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.811
He has an article in <i>Harper's.</i>

05:37.989 --> 05:40.907
Diane's been my teaching assistant
for two years.

05:41.034 --> 05:43.989
Today, I was sitting in my office
with Diane.

05:44.121 --> 05:47.954
I looked up from my Proust,
she had her nose in her Yeats.

05:49.169 --> 05:54.460
I said to myself, "I would be crazy
to let this girl get out of my life."

05:54.592 --> 05:57.878
So, right there on the spot,
I said, "Let's get married."

05:58.638 --> 06:04.013
What he actually said was,
"Come with me and be my love,

06:04.145 --> 06:06.850
and we will
some new pleasures prove."

06:06.981 --> 06:10.018
- That's Donne.
- I certainly hope so.

06:11.278 --> 06:14.648
No. John Donne, the poet.

06:15.450 --> 06:17.443
Well, that's lovely.

06:18.704 --> 06:21.622
Listen, I must dash.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.240
- Excuse me, what's your name?
- Sam.

06:24.377 --> 06:28.162
Listen, Sam, old man,
I have an errand to run.

06:28.298 --> 06:33.210
Diane will stay here. I'd appreciate
it if you would keep an eye on her.

06:33.346 --> 06:36.716
For you, Sumner, old man,
I'll keep both my eyes on her.

06:36.850 --> 06:43.103
Sumner, am I stupid to let you go see
a woman you were once in love with?

06:43.233 --> 06:46.234
Darling,
I'm leaving you alone in a bar.

06:46.361 --> 06:49.778
- Which one of us is the stupider?
- Too close to call.

06:51.743 --> 06:56.370
In any case, you sit at the bar
and chat with Sam while I'm gone.

06:56.498 --> 06:59.619
I'll be back before you know it
with your wedding ring.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.997
He's quite a fella, your fiancé.

07:06.135 --> 07:10.263
Listen, you don't have to
make conversation with me.

07:10.390 --> 07:13.308
I'm not in the habit
of talking with bartenders.

07:13.435 --> 07:16.602
I understand. One's trying
to move into my neighbourhood.

07:19.108 --> 07:20.651
Call that a football team?

07:20.777 --> 07:24.396
- What's wrong, Coach?
- The Patriots did it again.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.774
This is the worst draft yet.

07:26.909 --> 07:28.867
They got a first-round pick.

07:28.995 --> 07:31.665
Did they get a jackrabbit
for the backfield? No.

07:31.790 --> 07:35.740
A gunslinger at quarterback? No.
A linebacker they get.

07:35.878 --> 07:38.583
I've seen a good linebacker
turn a team around.

07:38.715 --> 07:40.340
Yeah, me, too.

07:42.678 --> 07:44.718
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:44.847 --> 07:47.635
I hope nobody told you
the bus goes by here.

07:47.767 --> 07:50.140
She'll be here for a while.

07:50.604 --> 07:54.305
Excuse me. I hate to keep asking
for special attention,

07:54.442 --> 07:57.858
but could you not discuss
my private life with everyone?

07:57.988 --> 08:01.440
- What would you like me to tell him?
- I don't care.

08:03.077 --> 08:05.485
- She's a hooker.
- Yeah?

08:07.582 --> 08:09.908
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

08:10.043 --> 08:12.250
- Carla's late again.
- Nuts.

08:13.965 --> 08:18.378
OK, I'm late! My kid was throwing up
all over the place.

08:18.512 --> 08:20.421
You don't buy that excuse, I quit.

08:20.556 --> 08:23.723
I don't work for a man who has
no compassion for my children.

08:23.851 --> 08:27.221
And you're not exactly swamped here.
I'm usually punctual.

08:27.356 --> 08:30.855
If you don't like it, fine.
This ain't such a great job.

08:30.985 --> 08:32.015
I'm gonna change.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.821
Think I was too hard on her?

08:37.491 --> 08:39.450
- Hiya, Coach.
- Hi, Carla.

08:39.578 --> 08:42.448
Patriots finally got
the linebacker they needed.

08:42.582 --> 08:45.702
Are you nuts? They're up to
their ears in linebackers!

08:45.836 --> 08:48.873
That's true. They do have a lot.

08:52.594 --> 08:54.670
I love to see a woman

08:54.805 --> 08:57.925
who isn't afraid
to take her luggage out for a drink.

08:58.893 --> 09:00.767
She doesn't want to be disturbed.

09:01.437 --> 09:03.976
Well, tell Her Nibs I'm sorry.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.771
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

09:07.903 --> 09:11.605
- Norm, what do you know?
- Not enough.

09:11.741 --> 09:14.280
What do you think
of the Patriots' draft?

09:14.411 --> 09:16.903
They need linebackers
like I need antlers.

09:17.039 --> 09:19.957
That new linebacker will put 'em
in the Super Bowl.

09:20.084 --> 09:23.917
He'll probably do that.
I got an awful headache.

09:24.465 --> 09:28.130
Sox lost again today, Sam.
Sure could have used you.

09:28.261 --> 09:30.088
Not in the shape I'm in, Norm.

09:31.348 --> 09:32.593
You, miss!

09:33.016 --> 09:36.766
Wouldn't you love to see Sammy
flinging the horsehide?

09:36.896 --> 09:38.141
Flinging what?

09:38.273 --> 09:42.852
Don't you know who he is? He was
one of the best pitchers in baseball.

09:44.029 --> 09:46.568
Samuel "Mayday" Malone.

09:46.741 --> 09:50.822
I coached this kid in double-A ball,
and with the Red Sox.

09:50.954 --> 09:54.075
He was one of the best
Little Leaguers ever.

09:54.208 --> 09:57.744
- Take it easy, Coach.
- No, I mean it, he was the best.

09:57.879 --> 10:00.834
- Sure as the earth is round.
- You don't believe that.

10:00.966 --> 10:06.388
I didn't until I saw those pictures
from the space shuttle.

10:07.807 --> 10:13.763
Sam once struck out Cash, Kaline and
Freehan with a tying run on second.

10:16.026 --> 10:18.778
How long is the wimp convention
in town?

10:18.904 --> 10:20.944
Carla, heel.

10:24.035 --> 10:27.239
If you were so good,
why aren't you still playing?

10:27.372 --> 10:31.667
I developed an elbow problem.
I bent it too much.

10:31.794 --> 10:33.170
You were a drunk?

10:33.296 --> 10:36.796
Are you kidding?
He was a great drunk.

10:36.925 --> 10:38.550
Anything he did, it was great.

10:38.677 --> 10:42.462
I was not a great drunk.
I was a good drunk.

10:42.599 --> 10:44.223
Are you drunk now?

10:44.351 --> 10:46.344
I haven't had a drink in three years.

10:46.478 --> 10:50.808
I'm proud you licked it, Sammy.
Must've been hell.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.694
- Why do you own a bar?
- I bought it when I was a drunk.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.444
I held on to it
for sentimental reasons.

10:58.576 --> 11:02.277
You, miss. What you reading?

11:02.414 --> 11:03.873
A book?

11:05.709 --> 11:08.913
Excuse me. Where is your bathroom?

11:09.046 --> 11:10.956
Next to my bedroom.

11:12.926 --> 11:14.005
Down the hall.

11:20.477 --> 11:22.386
So, what's Goldilocks's story?

11:22.521 --> 11:24.514
- Never mind.
- Come on, Sam.

11:24.648 --> 11:28.777
- Why can't you tell us?
- Yeah, what's the big deal?

11:28.903 --> 11:32.854
Take it easy.
Sam's shy about these things.

11:32.991 --> 11:36.443
- I'll fill you in. She's a hooker.
- She's not a hooker.

11:36.579 --> 11:38.905
Well, not in the traditional sense.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.832
She's not a hooker at all.

11:40.959 --> 11:44.495
Finest young lady I ever met.
My head is killing me.

11:44.630 --> 11:48.296
Look, she does not want
to be bothered.

11:48.426 --> 11:50.135
She's waiting for her fiancé.

11:50.262 --> 11:54.426
They're going to the Caribbean
to get married. OK?

12:08.200 --> 12:09.908
They missed you.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.555
Another beer, Norm?

12:27.681 --> 12:30.932
Well, yeah, one more quick one.
Thanks.

12:33.062 --> 12:35.768
- He's not back yet?
- No.

12:35.899 --> 12:38.225
Why don't you make a run for it?

12:39.570 --> 12:42.322
You're a bitter little person,
aren't you?

12:44.492 --> 12:46.699
Yeah. Well, I have a right to be.

12:46.829 --> 12:50.329
- My husband left me with four kids.
- Four kids?

12:50.458 --> 12:54.124
Right. And after I paid his way
through school hustling drinks.

12:54.254 --> 12:56.247
What school did your husband go to?

12:56.382 --> 12:58.125
The Colletti Academy.

12:59.010 --> 13:00.421
TV repair.

13:02.305 --> 13:05.010
So the minute he graduated,
he left me.

13:05.142 --> 13:10.184
Said I wouldn't fit in with the
other repairmen's wives. Big shot!

13:11.274 --> 13:15.403
- He sounds like a cur.
- Yeah. Well, he's not all bad.

13:15.529 --> 13:18.447
He still fixes my set
and only bills me for parts.

13:21.578 --> 13:23.487
If it's my missus, I'm on my way.

13:24.498 --> 13:28.579
Cheers. Yeah, just a sec.
Is there an Ernie Pantusso?

13:28.711 --> 13:30.669
- That's you, Coach.
- Speaking.

13:32.007 --> 13:35.673
I'd like two draughts
and a Scotch on the rocks.

13:35.803 --> 13:39.504
That group's arguing
about the sweatiest movie ever made.

13:39.641 --> 13:41.183
The what?

13:41.310 --> 13:43.883
What movie
did people sweat most in?

13:44.021 --> 13:45.646
That's easy. <i>Rocky II.</i>

13:45.773 --> 13:49.273
No, not even close.
<i>Body Heat.</i> Sweat city.

13:49.402 --> 13:52.238
<i>Ben Hur.</i> The boys
in that galley sweat like pigs.

13:52.364 --> 13:55.401
<i>Alien.</i> Buckets.

13:56.619 --> 14:01.496
The night before my wedding and
I'm in the middle of a sweat contest.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.997
Speaking of sweat,
here's a little-known fact.

14:06.131 --> 14:10.628
Women have fewer sweat glands than
men, but they're larger, more active.

14:10.761 --> 14:16.385
- The human body.
- Consequently, they sweat more.

14:16.518 --> 14:17.716
Really?

14:17.853 --> 14:22.646
Sure. How about you, miss?
What are your perspiration patterns?

14:29.909 --> 14:33.243
Sumner, I'm so glad to see you.

14:33.371 --> 14:37.749
These men have been arguing
over the sweatiest movie ever made.

14:37.876 --> 14:40.629
- <i>Cool Hand Luke.</i>
- That's one!

14:42.715 --> 14:46.584
What happened to you?
It's been over an hour.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.887
Diane, that woman is extraordinary.

14:51.601 --> 14:54.472
- Did she give you the ring?
- I couldn't take it.

14:54.604 --> 14:58.520
- We've got a plane to catch.
- Diane, I love you.

14:58.651 --> 15:02.519
But when I was with Barbara,
something stirred inside me.

15:02.656 --> 15:04.981
We can talk about it on the flight.

15:05.117 --> 15:07.240
I can't fly to Barbados
this confused.

15:07.370 --> 15:10.157
It's OK, the pilot knows the way.

15:13.752 --> 15:15.295
I love your wit.

15:15.796 --> 15:18.288
You're a beautiful child.

15:19.092 --> 15:23.719
- Let's go to Barbados.
- Let's go to Barbados.

15:25.891 --> 15:28.644
- Who isn't here?
- Me.

15:30.272 --> 15:33.024
Cheers. Just a minute.

15:36.571 --> 15:40.783
If you're not, I apologise,
but is your name Sumner Sloane?

15:40.909 --> 15:42.024
Yes, it is.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.168
Hello?

15:49.544 --> 15:54.373
No, it's alright.
She understands and I understand.

15:54.884 --> 15:58.550
Barbara, that's very human of you.
I'll be right over.

16:01.058 --> 16:05.353
And, Barbara,
your depth frightens me.

16:07.357 --> 16:09.931
She insists that you have the ring.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.394
We won't have time
to catch our flight.

16:12.530 --> 16:17.027
You call and get us
on a later flight. I'll get the ring.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.120
- Sumner...
- Yes?

16:19.246 --> 16:22.912
- How about a kiss?
- Maybe. I'll play it by ear.

16:48.823 --> 16:52.904
Cheer up, cookie.
He may have been in an accident.

16:55.289 --> 16:58.492
I'm knocking off, Sam.
Home to my book.

16:58.626 --> 17:02.790
- Still working on that novel?
- Yeah, coming on six years now.

17:02.923 --> 17:06.008
I got a feeling
I might finish it tonight.

17:06.135 --> 17:10.180
- You're writing a novel?
- No, reading one.

17:12.851 --> 17:15.603
Wait a second.
I want you to take Norm home.

17:17.147 --> 17:20.019
- Norm!
- I'm up.

17:20.151 --> 17:22.724
One quick one
then I really gotta fly.

17:24.239 --> 17:26.944
- Coach will take you home.
- I'll give you a lift.

17:27.076 --> 17:28.903
- Goodnight, Sam.
- Goodnight.

17:29.037 --> 17:32.905
Coach, we stop somewhere,
I'll buy you a beer.

17:33.042 --> 17:35.533
Norm, you're in here every night.

17:35.670 --> 17:38.078
Doesn't your wife wonder
where you're at?

17:38.214 --> 17:40.373
Wonders. Doesn't care.

17:45.723 --> 17:48.844
Night, Sam.
Thanks for letting me bend your ear.

17:48.977 --> 17:51.219
That's OK, Ron. Goodnight.

17:56.903 --> 18:00.273
You must get real tired
of hearing people cry in their beer.

18:03.327 --> 18:07.622
I wonder why people
tell bartenders their problems.

18:07.749 --> 18:11.000
- It's kind of sad, isn't it?
- Yeah.

18:11.128 --> 18:15.079
These poor wretches
with no one in the world to turn to

18:15.216 --> 18:18.134
but some stranger who mixes drinks.

18:18.762 --> 18:21.432
I met Sumner two years ago.

18:23.309 --> 18:27.390
I was so flattered
when he went out of his way

18:27.523 --> 18:30.275
to pick me as his teaching assistant.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.863
I'm still kind of in awe of him,
you know.

18:34.531 --> 18:38.315
He's the most brilliant man
I've ever known.

18:39.286 --> 18:43.534
For the last two years, he's been
the most important thing in my life,

18:43.667 --> 18:45.909
and now I may be losing him.

18:46.920 --> 18:47.952
Come on.

18:49.131 --> 18:52.881
Look, you are
a very attractive young lady.

18:57.141 --> 18:58.220
Thank you.

18:59.018 --> 19:01.094
Yeah. Sure.

19:02.564 --> 19:07.025
You're gonna find someone a lot
better than that goofy professor.

19:09.614 --> 19:12.865
Goofy? Are you talking about Sumner?

19:12.993 --> 19:15.911
- I'm talking about Sumner.
- You don't like Sumner.

19:16.038 --> 19:17.996
I don't like Sumner.

19:18.124 --> 19:21.410
- You know why you don't like Sumner?
- Because he's goofy.

19:22.087 --> 19:25.539
No. Because
he's everything you're not.

19:25.675 --> 19:31.132
He's well bred, highly educated,
he's distinguished, he's urbane...

19:31.264 --> 19:35.345
- You left out "goofy".
- I did not leave out "goofy"!

19:35.478 --> 19:38.515
- You were coming to it?
- I should have expected this.

19:38.648 --> 19:42.148
That goof will be on the cover
of <i>Saturday Review</i> someday.

19:42.277 --> 19:45.030
That goof is probably
gonna be on a beach tomorrow,

19:45.156 --> 19:47.279
rubbing suntan oil on his ex-wife.

19:52.832 --> 19:54.575
I've had a real rough day,

19:54.709 --> 19:58.043
and I'm now going to reward myself
by getting out of here.

19:59.715 --> 20:02.550
When Sumner comes back,
will you say I've gone home?

20:02.677 --> 20:03.875
Fine.

20:05.180 --> 20:08.383
I forgot to change
the reservations again.

20:08.517 --> 20:11.803
- Use this one.
- Thank you.

20:22.200 --> 20:27.028
I'd like to change the reservations
for Mr and Mrs Sumner Sloane,

20:27.164 --> 20:29.204
flight 481 to Barbados.

20:34.214 --> 20:37.880
They did? Are you sure?

20:42.223 --> 20:43.801
No, thank you.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.982
- I'm sorry.
- How did you know?

20:53.111 --> 20:55.151
Bartenders' intuition.

20:55.948 --> 21:00.824
A shame such an astute observer of
human nature is stuck behind a bar.

21:00.954 --> 21:03.113
That's what I think.

21:03.248 --> 21:06.748
Well, why not bring
your remarkable powers to bear

21:06.877 --> 21:09.832
and enlighten me
as to what my future holds?

21:12.759 --> 21:17.837
I'm probably gonna regret this,
but you could work here.

21:26.776 --> 21:28.057
Sam.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.612
Shut up for a second, will you?

21:30.739 --> 21:33.065
I need...

21:33.200 --> 21:37.033
I need two vodka gimlets,
one straight up, one blended, rocks,

21:37.163 --> 21:40.081
Chivas rocks, soda,
a Comfort Manhattan, no cherry,

21:40.208 --> 21:44.586
a white wine spritzer, an
Old Bushmill Irish decaf, no sugar.

21:44.714 --> 21:49.423
What makes you think I would
ever work in a place like this?

21:49.553 --> 21:52.590
Simple. You can't go back
to the professor for work.

21:53.558 --> 21:55.800
I need a waitress. You need a job.

21:55.935 --> 21:58.641
You like the people here.
You think they like you.

22:01.150 --> 22:06.228
And the phrase "magnificent pagan
beast" has never left your mind.

22:10.327 --> 22:11.822
Now, look, buster.

22:12.622 --> 22:15.623
I do need a job. And I'll find one.

22:15.750 --> 22:19.334
And you can bet
that it won't be waiting tables.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.375
What are you qualified to do?

22:25.303 --> 22:26.798
Nothing.

22:29.433 --> 22:33.432
But somewhere, there is a job
that I'm perfect for,

22:33.563 --> 22:35.188
that's perfect for me.

22:35.315 --> 22:38.435
I'll find it.
And when I do, I'll know it.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.064
Carla, what am I making?

22:42.115 --> 22:45.781
Two vodka gimlets,
one straight up, one blended, rocks,

22:45.911 --> 22:49.363
Chivas rocks, soda,
a Comfort Manhattan, no cherry,

22:49.499 --> 22:52.120
a white wine spritzer with a twist,

22:52.252 --> 22:56.500
one Old Bushmill lrish decaf,
hold the sugar.

23:08.312 --> 23:09.688
<i>Your first customers.</i>

23:10.148 --> 23:12.390
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

23:14.153 --> 23:16.110
Hello. Welcome to Cheers.

23:16.238 --> 23:21.316
My name is Diane. I will be serving
you. Why don't you sit down here?

23:21.453 --> 23:23.695
I should tell you, parenthetically,

23:23.831 --> 23:27.781
that you are the first people
that I have ever served.

23:27.919 --> 23:31.668
If anyone had told me a week ago
that I would be doing this,

23:31.799 --> 23:33.957
I would have thought them insane.

23:34.093 --> 23:38.257
When Sam offered me the job,
I laughed in his face.

23:38.390 --> 23:40.217
But then it occurred to me,...

23:42.520 --> 23:45.011
...here I am, I'm a student.

23:45.148 --> 23:49.442
Not just in an academic sense,
but a student of life.

23:49.569 --> 23:53.948
And where better than here
to study life in all its many facets?

23:54.075 --> 24:01.454
People meet in bars, they part,
they rejoice, they suffer.

24:02.084 --> 24:05.750
They come here
to be with their own kind.

24:07.299 --> 24:09.339
What can I get you?

24:09.760 --> 24:13.295
Where is police?
We have lost our luggage.
