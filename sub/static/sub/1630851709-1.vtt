summer camp.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.386
I heard you guys got
great maple syrup.

00:19.452 --> 00:20.687
Great Canadian bacon.

00:49.582 --> 00:52.786
And the 2nd kiss, and the 3rd.
For a big make out party.

01:00.827 --> 01:04.063
I'm seeing her as the
mother to my children.

01:04.130 --> 01:05.765
<i>Who will get caught up

01:05.832 --> 01:07.801
Ah, I'm too blunt

01:07.867 --> 01:10.537
I'm just so used to guys,
like, burning me.

01:10.603 --> 01:11.805
Anybody can walk down that dock.

01:11.871 --> 01:13.773
For this moment, she's my girl.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.810
- Little snake.
- Who'd I say was coming?!

01:16.876 --> 01:19.646
I don't feel like other people-
Oh, [beep]!

01:19.712 --> 01:21.881
Please tell me that
wasn't on camera.

01:21.948 --> 01:24.884
<i>And who will leave Camp
Paradise broken hearted?</i>

01:24.951 --> 01:27.387
I just don't want to make

I'm Jesse Jones.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.356
And it is my pleasure to
welcome you to the first ever

02:03.423 --> 02:06.493
season of Bachelor in
Paradise Canada.

02:06.559 --> 02:09.562
Nestled against a lake in
beautiful northern Ontario,

02:09.629 --> 02:13.099
our singles will spend their
summer here, at Camp Paradise,

02:13.166 --> 02:16.503
where they'll get a chance to
experience all of the highs and

02:16.569 --> 02:20.039
the lows that summer camp
has to offer.

02:20.106 --> 02:21.908
Our singles are on their way.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.410
So, prepare yourself
for a season like

02:24.477 --> 02:28.147
you've never seen before.
Because Camp Paradise...

02:28.214 --> 02:29.749
is open.

03:58.871 --> 04:00.873
Hey, guys. I'm Brendan.
I'm 26 years old,

04:00.940 --> 04:02.976
and I'm from Katie's season
of The Bachelorette.

04:03.042 --> 04:03.910
Hello.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.812
You look absolutely
incredible tonight.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.046
Thank you.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.881
Getting this opportunity,
I'm obviously grateful for it.

04:08.948 --> 04:12.051
Not too many people get a
second chance of finding love.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.053
I didn't get there,
in my season.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.755
I'm not here to play games.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.657
I'm just, I'm coming in
to be myself.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.726
And, you know, whoever I
connect with, that's...

04:19.792 --> 04:21.494
that's al that matters to me.

04:21.561 --> 04:22.562
- Brendan!
- How's it going, man?

04:22.629 --> 04:24.063
- It's a pleasure.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.264
Yeah, you too.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.233
So, you're just coming off
doing Bachelorette as well?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.636
Yeah, it's been a, it's been
a wild journey, man.

04:29.702 --> 04:31.170
You know, obviously,
I didn't find love there.

04:31.237 --> 04:32.705
But, that's why I'm here
in Paradise.

04:32.772 --> 04:33.973
I feel like this is
more my vibe.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.842
What are you looking
forward to most?

04:35.908 --> 04:37.810
Ah, meet someone, you know,
really cool.

04:37.877 --> 04:39.879
And, someone who's adventurous
and who wants to be with me,

04:39.946 --> 04:41.214
and who I connect with.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.082
- Brendan, I'm feeling the vibe.
- Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

04:43.149 --> 04:44.117
- Welcome to Paradise.
- Thank you, man.

04:44.183 --> 04:45.652
- I'll see you over there.
- Yeah, of course.

04:45.718 --> 04:46.953
Thank you, man.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.821
Coming into Paradise, I'm just
more in touch with my emotions

04:48.888 --> 04:51.024
and my feelings and,
I know what I want.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.892
When you find the right person,
you know,

04:52.959 --> 04:55.061
you kind of get tunnel vision
and you just stay in your lane

04:55.128 --> 04:57.096
so, I just want to enjoy
this experience.

04:57.163 --> 04:59.632
You know, super stoked for
that and, but you know,

04:59.699 --> 05:01.901
love is obviously the,
the biggest thing.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.536
- Welcome to Paradise, man.
- Thank you, man.

05:03.603 --> 05:05.271
- It's an honour to be here.
- First one here.

05:05.338 --> 05:06.539
Were you expecting to
see someone, or-?

05:06.606 --> 05:08.975
I was, I was. I knew you were
gonna be here, but... you know.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.176
Just me so far.
I hope that's okay.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.744
Yeah, man.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.112
The atmosphere here in
Paradise is incredible.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.981
This is totally, you know,
my atmosphere.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.150
Obviously, a bar on the beach,
nothing can beat that and,

05:17.216 --> 05:18.685
Kevin's bartending and,
you know,

05:18.751 --> 05:19.585
you can't beat that either.

05:19.652 --> 05:20.386
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.587
- Good to meet ya.
- You too, man.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.193
Hey, guys.
I'm Illeana.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.196
You might know me from Matt's
season of The Bachelor.

05:30.263 --> 05:35.334
I did take giant meatball out
of a purse and feed it to him.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.804
Take a little bite. Alright.

05:37.870 --> 05:41.808
Ha-ha! Yes, that is my claim
to fame, right there.

05:41.874 --> 05:43.776
So, what do you
think of my balls?

05:43.843 --> 05:44.944
Not bad.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.679
Really like to leave the
stuffing balls in

05:46.746 --> 05:48.681
people's faces behind me.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.717
- Illeana!
- Hello!

05:50.783 --> 05:52.685
-
- I'm here!

05:52.752 --> 05:55.188
- Welcome to Paradise.
- Thank you.

05:55.254 --> 05:58.091
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing incredibly well.

05:58.157 --> 06:00.626
So, you were on the last
season of The Bachelor?

06:00.693 --> 06:03.129
- I sure was.
- Tell me about that.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.997
You know, it was a
great experience.

06:05.064 --> 06:08.134
I put myself out there and,
I learned a lot from it.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.203
I mean, here I am.
I'm doing it, part two.

06:10.269 --> 06:11.938
So, I, I clearly liked it.

06:12.004 --> 06:15.274
- Illeana, welcome to...?
- Paradise!

06:15.341 --> 06:17.009
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

06:17.076 --> 06:20.713
I'm here to meet my husband.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.115
That's what I'm here for.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.851
I hope to make
wonderful connections.

06:24.917 --> 06:27.754
And if I do meet, you know,
someone that I'm gonna fall

06:27.820 --> 06:30.323
in love with, that is just
the icing on the cake.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.125
You have someone
coming over here.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.293
- Hello!
- Hello, hello!

06:34.360 --> 06:36.362
- Welcome to Paradise!
- I'm Brendan.

06:36.429 --> 06:37.630
- Hey.
- How are ya?

06:37.697 --> 06:39.232
Good, how are you?
I'm Illeana.

06:39.298 --> 06:40.867
- It's nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.268
- Can I get you a drink?
- Oh...

06:42.335 --> 06:43.469
- Yeah.
- Yes.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.671
- What are you in the mood for?
- Can I have a margarita?

06:45.738 --> 06:47.907
First impression of Illeana,
you know, she's, she's stunning.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.276
Beautiful, great smile.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.078
Brendan, you've got a
nice tan going already.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.147
- I mean, how did you get that?
- Okay, so, funny story.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.149
So, in our hotel room,
every morning, 8:30,

06:56.215 --> 06:57.083
sun would beam in.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.284
Oh, my god, wait,
did you lay out a towel?

06:58.351 --> 06:59.252
- Oh, yeah.
- Me too.

06:59.318 --> 07:00.119
Yeah, bronzer.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.954
What's your go-to
bronzer of choice?

07:02.021 --> 07:04.390
'Cause I might have to...
I might have to...

07:04.457 --> 07:06.359
I brought it with me.
We can share, for sure.

07:06.425 --> 07:07.960
Illeana's for sure
my type of girl.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.263
Very soft spoken, but very
confident as well.

07:10.329 --> 07:12.131
She's giving me good energy
right off the bat.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.866
Well, you did a great job
́cause you definitely-

07:13.933 --> 07:16.402
You as well. You look great.
You look amazing.

07:16.469 --> 07:19.872
For now,
my eyes are set on her.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.378
- Oh, hey.
- Hi, Kamil.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.846
What's up, man?
How are you?

07:26.913 --> 07:28.915
- I am great, man.
- Welcome to Paradise!

07:28.981 --> 07:31.250
Thank you so much.
Excited to be here, man.

07:31.317 --> 07:32.752
I'm Kamil, I'm 33.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.153
You probably remember me
from Becca's season

07:34.220 --> 07:36.222
of The Bachelorette.

07:36.289 --> 07:40.159
And also, Bachelor in Paradise,
season 5.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.360
I love you.

07:44.063 --> 07:45.998
I left Paradise with
a relationship.

07:46.065 --> 07:48.000
Whoo!

07:48.067 --> 07:52.805
And, on the last episode, I,
I broke up with Annalise.

07:52.872 --> 07:56.309
You deserve the best and...

07:56.375 --> 07:58.211
I think...

07:58.277 --> 08:00.313
I might not be the guy for you.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.351
Our relationship was
already like, turbulent.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.987
And, I don't regret it
whatsoever, at this point.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.891
I'm coming to Paradise
for the second time.

08:11.958 --> 08:14.227
And I feel like it's a new
opportunity for me.

08:14.293 --> 08:18.097
Hopefully, I don't
mess it up again.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.033
- Hey, all, how are you?
- Hey!

08:21.100 --> 08:22.201
I'm Kamil,
nice to meet you guys.

08:22.268 --> 08:23.169
How's it going, man?
How are ya?

08:23.236 --> 08:24.370
It feels good to see someone.
How are ya?

08:24.437 --> 08:25.338
- Brendan.
- Kamil.

08:25.404 --> 08:25.905
Kamil, nice to meet you, man.
A pleasure.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.406
- Hey.
- Hi, Kamil.

08:27.473 --> 08:28.641
Nice to meet you.
How are you?

08:28.708 --> 08:30.276
- Illeana, nice to meet you.
- So, how are you guys doing?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.311
Welcome!
Are you so happy to be here?

08:32.378 --> 08:34.347
Yeah, I'm very happy.
Where are you guys from?

08:34.413 --> 08:35.781
- I'm Toronto.
- Oh, nice.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.016
- I'm a Canadian boy, yeah.
- Cool, cool.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.518
- Ah, I'm from New York.
- Me too.

08:38.584 --> 08:40.386
- Okay!
- Yeah, what part of New York?

08:40.453 --> 08:41.454
Like, Manhattan.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.488
I live right outside
Manhattan.

08:42.555 --> 08:43.923
- Okay.
- Yeah, an hour north.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.258
- Only Canadian...
- But I work in Manhattan.

08:45.324 --> 08:46.058
- Okay.
- Which is cool.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.927
Only Canadian.
Just, just like me.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.295
You know what, I'm pretty
sure there's gonna be

08:49.362 --> 08:50.429
a lot more Canadians here.

08:50.496 --> 08:52.932
Yeah, I think so too.
I love Canadians, but who knows.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.001
- I know, Canadians are nice.
- They are really nice.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.369
You guys are so
sweet and polite.

08:56.435 --> 08:59.472
New Yorkers are like sharks.
We'll just like...

08:59.538 --> 09:02.108
chop you up and spit you out.

09:06.946 --> 09:10.950
My name is Lisa, I'm 28,
from St. Catherine's, Ontario.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.386
Oh! Good boy.

09:13.452 --> 09:15.421
You may recognize me from
Chris Leroux's season of

09:15.488 --> 09:19.292
Bachelor Canada as the
mermaid squirrel whisperer.

09:19.358 --> 09:21.994
Now, while I do still love
being a mermaid...

09:22.061 --> 09:23.396
and hanging with squirrels...

09:23.462 --> 09:24.530
Oh!

09:24.597 --> 09:26.165
I am now living my life,
full-time,

09:26.232 --> 09:29.101
as a professional cosplay
artist. Basically,

09:29.168 --> 09:31.070
I get paid to act like every
day is Halloween,

09:31.137 --> 09:33.039
and I couldn't be happier.

09:33.105 --> 09:34.273
Mm!

09:34.340 --> 09:37.076
Mum's gonna miss you.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.378
So, my love life hasn't
really changed at all since

09:39.445 --> 09:41.547
my season on the
Bachelor Canada.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.883
I want to feel genuine love
with somebody,

09:43.950 --> 09:45.918
and I want to hear and
express those words,

09:45.985 --> 09:49.388
"I love you" to myself, and I'm
hoping I find that in Paradise.

09:49.455 --> 09:51.157
That would be legit.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.594
I didn't know we'd be
at the beach,

09:54.660 --> 09:56.128
or I wouldn't have
worn these shoes.

09:58.497 --> 10:00.366
- Hi!
- Hey!

10:00.433 --> 10:02.401
I think that's Shushanna.

10:02.468 --> 10:05.071
I see a girl that's like
about 5-foot tall,

10:05.137 --> 10:06.973
with heels, long hair.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.040
Shushanna?

10:08.107 --> 10:10.610
And I'm like, "Shushanna?"
From my season.

10:10.676 --> 10:13.212
For someone who keeps
saying she's not a witch,

10:13.279 --> 10:14.547
she's all over the map.

10:19.585 --> 10:20.553
Who is that?

10:20.620 --> 10:23.189
- Hi, guys!
- Hey! How are you?

10:23.255 --> 10:24.957
- I recognize you.
- Yes, what's up?

10:25.024 --> 10:26.158
Hi, I'm Lisa.

10:26.225 --> 10:27.360
Eugh, bad mistake.

10:27.426 --> 10:29.462
Sorry, I thought you were
somebody else for one second?

10:29.528 --> 10:30.429
- What?
- Yeah.

10:30.496 --> 10:31.364
- Really?!
- From far away.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.466
- I better be better looking.
- Yeah...

10:38.337 --> 10:39.171
I gotta get a drink.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.173
Yeah, yeah, Kevin's
waving you down.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.475
I will go do that. I wanna
talk to you guys

10:42.541 --> 10:44.276
Alright, nice meeting you,
Lisa.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.379
When it comes to, like,
romance, I'm like, alright,

10:46.445 --> 10:49.148
I am now a 16-year-old awkward
boy and I have nothing to say.

10:49.215 --> 10:52.418
And I've never had any dates.
And I am just like... enh!

10:52.485 --> 10:54.487
I'll just like, run down the
beach in these really

10:54.553 --> 10:56.655
impractical shoes that nobody
told me we'd be at the beach.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.491
And nobody told me not
to wear 6-inch shoes.

10:58.557 --> 11:00.459
Take ́em off, it's sand!

11:00.526 --> 11:03.362
No! I lose all my power
when I lose all my height.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.106
We're just chilling. We're
waiting for everyone to arrive.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.575
- Hello!
- Hey, guys!

11:16.642 --> 11:18.644
Angela.
She was on my season.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.446
How are you?

11:22.281 --> 11:24.116
I'm Angela.
I'm 31.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.918
I was on Nick's season
of The Bachelor,

11:25.985 --> 11:29.321
and season 5 and 6 of
Bachelor in Paradise.

11:29.388 --> 11:32.425
Paradise has always been a
little bit tough for me.

11:32.491 --> 11:36.495
- When we decided to end thing--
- Ah, we didn't decide.

11:36.562 --> 11:38.130
- You decided.
- Okay!

11:38.197 --> 11:39.298
We didn't decide.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.668
I took a risk,
it didn't work out.

11:42.735 --> 11:47.006
But, maybe third
time's the charm.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.408
I want it to work this time.
I'm just gonna, you know,

11:49.475 --> 11:53.379
be even more open and
more vulnerable.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.981
I don't know, I just, I have
such a good feeling.

11:56.048 --> 12:00.586
It's finally like,
hopefully my time.

12:00.653 --> 12:01.620
- Hey, oh my god!
- Hey, what's up?

12:01.687 --> 12:03.389
- Long time no see.
- Hi!

12:03.456 --> 12:04.724
- How you been?
- How are you?

12:04.790 --> 12:06.225
- Wow!
- It's been a minute.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.326
I wasn't expecting you.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.295
You probably weren't
expecting me either, wow!

12:09.361 --> 12:10.730
- Hey, I'm Angela.
- Illeana.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.731
Oh, beautiful, Illeana.
Nice to meet you.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.133
- Hi! Oh, my gosh!
- How are you?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.602
Welcome. I'm like,
she's got good hair...

12:16.669 --> 12:17.670
- So...
- I'm Angela.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.638
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you too.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.140
- What's your name?
- Lisa.

12:21.207 --> 12:22.241
I was from
Bachelor Canada.

12:22.308 --> 12:23.242
Oh, cool.
Oh, my gosh, amazing.

12:23.309 --> 12:26.579
Did you watch it, no!
I'm kidding.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.147
Super nerd.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.751
I want to know about you guys.
What do you guys do?

12:32.818 --> 12:35.087
I'm a professional cosplayer...

12:35.154 --> 12:37.223
which sounds made up,
but it's not made up.

12:37.289 --> 12:38.691
Oh, my god, someone else.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.060
Someone else.
Oh, he's doing the walk.

12:50.369 --> 12:53.139
I see this guy coming
down the beach.

12:56.342 --> 13:01.747
He has kind of just like that
intangible, like, swag.

13:01.814 --> 13:04.450
That, like, athletic build.

13:07.086 --> 13:11.724
His honey, green, amazing eyes.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.728
Yeah, I'm definitely looking
very much forward to

13:15.794 --> 13:17.730
getting to know him more.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.432
- Hi!
- How's it going?

13:25.371 --> 13:27.439
Agh! I'm too blunt,
and I'm too pure,

13:27.506 --> 13:30.075
and I'm too honest. A lot of
people are pieces of shit.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.343
It might not be
revealed now,

13:31.410 --> 13:35.181
but it's probably gonna get
revealed. And I can't wait.

13:35.247 --> 13:36.682
I'm digging Kamil right now.

13:36.749 --> 13:37.716
I think we'll have a good time.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.753
- Hi, everyone.
- Oh, my god.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.521
They work together and,
apparently,

13:42.588 --> 13:43.722
they don't work well together.

13:43.789 --> 13:46.325
I think we can all kind of feel
the animosity in the room.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.760
- Can we go for a walk?
- Yeah, let's go.

13:47.826 --> 13:51.363
I don't want it to be a
competition between me and Vay.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.565
I do want to see how
this plays out ́cause

13:52.631 --> 13:55.067
I like a good cat fight...
Meow.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.681
- Oh, my god, someone else.
- Someone else.

14:08.747 --> 14:10.449
Oh, he's doing the walk.

14:10.516 --> 14:14.687
- How's it going?
- Hi!

14:14.753 --> 14:17.156
Put hands on our...

14:17.223 --> 14:20.793
on our knees, nice and calm.
Close your eyes, just relax.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.496
Inhale...

14:24.563 --> 14:28.567
Exhale.

14:28.634 --> 14:33.806
It feels good, doesn't it?
I feel so amazing right now.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.776
My name is Brendan.
I am from Edmonton, Alberta,

14:37.843 --> 14:39.411
and I am 30 years old.

14:39.478 --> 14:41.280
I used to be a professional
football player.

14:41.347 --> 14:42.548
I played in the CFL.

14:42.615 --> 14:46.785
And, now I'm a full-time
yoga instructor.

14:46.852 --> 14:50.823
Right now, my life, I would say
I am mentally sound,

14:50.889 --> 14:53.792
I am calm. I am happy.

14:53.859 --> 14:58.197
I'm looking for a woman
who's loving, kind,

14:58.264 --> 15:01.800
secure with themselves.
Giving, forgiving.

15:01.867 --> 15:04.236
And that's the reason that
I'm here in Paradise.

15:04.303 --> 15:05.304
- Kamil.
- Brendan.

15:05.371 --> 15:06.372
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, brother.

15:06.438 --> 15:07.940
Hey, I'm Angela.
It's so nice to meet you.

15:08.007 --> 15:08.908
We're gonna hug,
we're gonna hug.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.409
- We're allowed to hug now.
-

15:10.476 --> 15:13.579
Brendan M. walks in and,
of course,

15:13.646 --> 15:17.883
I thought he was super
attractive. Definitely my type.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.452
I'm excited to explore the,

15:20.519 --> 15:22.855
the Brendan M. avenue
a little bit.

15:22.922 --> 15:23.789
Alright, how old are you?

15:23.856 --> 15:26.558
How old do you think I am?
Take a guess.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.328
- Don't do this to me.
- Guess low.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.497
Don't, don't do me dirty, okay?

15:31.563 --> 15:33.666
27, 28?

15:33.732 --> 15:35.334
That's a pretty good guess.
I'm actually 30.

15:35.401 --> 15:36.635
Oh, okay, okay.

15:36.702 --> 15:37.736
He just looks like a man!

15:37.803 --> 15:39.505
Like, I want somebody who's
gonna like pick me up,

15:39.571 --> 15:40.940
and if need be-
you know what I mean?

15:41.006 --> 15:43.208
Or, throw a punch if necessary.

15:43.275 --> 15:47.713
And I feel like he, he would be
up for the challenge.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.215
- I'm gonna do the same thing!
- Alright.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.452
How old do I look?
Be nice, be gentle.

15:53.519 --> 15:54.753
I already know you're
gonna lie, it's fine.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.622
20... 23?

15:57.956 --> 16:01.860
- Stop! I'm 31.
- You're 31?

16:01.927 --> 16:03.696
- I'm 31.
- You wear it well.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.331
- 23!
- I don't know!

16:05.397 --> 16:07.433
- Wow!
- Yeah, you look good.

16:07.499 --> 16:10.736
- Points for Brendan.
- There we go.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.439
It's been a minute since
I felt butterflies.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.274
I'm glad you're here.
Brendan?

16:15.341 --> 16:16.642
- Brendan, yeah.
- What's my name?

16:16.709 --> 16:18.777
- Shit, I was gonna ask you!
- Bye, "Brandon"!

16:18.844 --> 16:20.379
No, don't do that to me now!

16:27.519 --> 16:29.755
- Chris!
- Hey, man.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.757
- How you doing?
- So good.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.026
- Hey, welcome to Paradise.
- Nice to meet you.

16:34.093 --> 16:35.961
I'm Chris, and I'm from
Jasmine's season

16:36.028 --> 16:37.963
of The Bachelorette, Canada.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.332
Whoa...

16:40.399 --> 16:41.934
Art.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.636
I'm an inventor, I'm an artist.
I'm a musician.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.538
I'm a filmmaker,
I'm a photographer.

16:46.605 --> 16:49.908
I'm a lover.
I'm a bit of a renaissance man.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.483
I've heard from a lot of people
that I'm a very interesting guy.

16:57.549 --> 17:00.052
The most interesting guy
they've ever met.

17:00.119 --> 17:03.022
My time on The Bachelorette
was tough.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.990
Just another broken dream.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.725
There's two different
kinds of guys.

17:06.792 --> 17:12.731
There's the geeks and the jocks.
And, I was in the geek squad.

17:12.798 --> 17:16.301
I tried to impress Jasmine
with how smart I was,

17:16.368 --> 17:20.372
and I completely ignored
the emotional side.

17:20.439 --> 17:23.509
I... don't.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.044
I was,
I was a much- like,

17:25.110 --> 17:27.880
I was a much different person
back then.

17:27.946 --> 17:30.949
Since then, I really got in
touch with myself.

17:31.016 --> 17:34.053
And, now when I
meet with people,

17:34.119 --> 17:36.655
I really look for the
heart connection.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.658
Chris, welcome to Bachelor in
Paradise Canada, my friend.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.361
- Ah! I'm so excited.
- Go in there, brother.

17:42.428 --> 17:43.562
- Thanks, man!
- Alright.

17:43.629 --> 17:44.696
The beach awaits you, Chris.

17:44.763 --> 17:47.733
Oh, I'm gonna get crazy.
I'm gonna be singing, dancing...

17:47.800 --> 17:49.868
laughing.
I'm gonna bring the fun.

17:49.935 --> 17:51.970
Now I'm here,
this is my destiny.

17:52.037 --> 17:53.539
Oh, my god, hey!

17:53.605 --> 17:54.907
Bachelor,
Bachelor Canada nation.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.108
Kamil, nice to meet you.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.042
- Amil?
- Kamil.

17:57.142 --> 18:00.446
I feel so comfortable here
that I can just

18:00.512 --> 18:03.849
be myself and be outgoing.
And I'm just taking it all in.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.598
My name's Caitlin.
I was on Colton's

18:19.665 --> 18:20.999
season of The Bachelor.

18:21.066 --> 18:24.937
And, Bachelor in Paradise
season 6.

18:25.003 --> 18:29.908
In my season of Paradise,
I'm likely most memorable for

18:29.975 --> 18:33.112
getting involved in the Blake
stagecoach drama.

18:33.178 --> 18:36.548
And then, unfortunately,
got blindsided.

18:36.615 --> 18:41.587
Being caught in a love triangle
is not a happy place to be.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.021
- Hey!
- How are you?

18:43.088 --> 18:44.156
- I'm Caitlin.
- I'm Brendan, nice to meet you.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.457
Hi, Brendan.
Nice to meet you.

18:45.524 --> 18:46.558
- You can give a hug.
- Okay.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.826
Yeah, it's okay.
Masks are off.

18:47.893 --> 18:48.794
- I know, right?
- Hi, how are you?

18:48.861 --> 18:50.863
- Good, how are you?
- So nice to meet you.

18:50.929 --> 18:53.732
I'm excited to give the
Canadian Paradise a go.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.100
Hopefully, I can find
somebody who's

18:55.167 --> 18:56.502
a little bit closer to home.

18:56.568 --> 18:59.872
Not get mixed up
in the boy drama.

18:59.938 --> 19:03.175
And that I can walk out of here
with the love of my life.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.546
Caitlin's really cool.
I met her in New York.

19:07.613 --> 19:08.881
- Kamil, what's up?
- Hey, you.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.082
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

19:10.148 --> 19:11.750
- Long time no see.
- I know.

19:11.817 --> 19:12.784
- How you been?
- Good.

19:12.851 --> 19:14.786
- You look great. Welcome.
- Thanks, so do you.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.188
We shared a drink, talked.

19:16.255 --> 19:17.656
And I feel like we have
a lot in common.

19:17.723 --> 19:20.159
She does real estate,
I do real estate.

19:20.225 --> 19:21.326
She's like an equestrian.

19:21.393 --> 19:24.796
I watch Heartland on Netflix.
It's like, meant to be.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.899
- Name again?
- Chris.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.166
Chris, hi.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.103
Caitlin walks in and
I'm getting excited.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.804
How do you even get up here?

19:32.871 --> 19:34.806
I was hoping she would be here.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.909
If I'm being honest, like,
a bit of my downfall when

19:36.975 --> 19:40.078
it comes to dating is like,
I'm just so-

19:40.145 --> 19:41.980
I've been so
invested in my work.

19:42.047 --> 19:45.050
The wheels are turning in my
head as she's saying how

19:45.117 --> 19:47.486
she's looking for a guy
who understands

19:47.553 --> 19:48.620
her professional career.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.856
- There's not a lot of people-
- Who understand.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.824
A lot of men who are
confident enough to

19:52.891 --> 19:55.861
take on somebody who,
like, me.

19:55.928 --> 19:59.498
I like doing what I do, and I
want to be able to, like,

19:59.565 --> 20:00.799
build my empire.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.968
Hey, I'm right here.
Like, let's do this.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.870
You know what it is, they're
just not comfortable with,

20:04.937 --> 20:07.105
like, a powerful woman.
- Yeah.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.208
- It's very cool to meet you.
- It's good to meet you too.

20:09.274 --> 20:12.978
I'm... I'm intrigued,
Caitlin.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.147
Good. It's a
good place to be.

20:23.021 --> 20:25.023
My name is Jeremy,
I'm 28 years old.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.993
And I'm from Montreal, Quebec.
I love to dance.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.962
There's just something about
moving my body.

20:30.028 --> 20:32.164
I let the hips, I let
everything just move.

20:32.230 --> 20:35.667
And I just go with it.
I'm a bit of a freestyler.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.169
I'm ready to get out there,
you know.

20:37.236 --> 20:41.873
I'm a bird and I
need to fly.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.811
- Haha, welcome to Paradise.
- Hey, what's up?

20:45.877 --> 20:46.979
- How are you?
- How you doing?

20:47.045 --> 20:48.580
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.115
What are you most
excited about, man?

20:50.182 --> 20:53.151
I'm looking for someone to
cuddle up, you know.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.621
A little
bit of romance.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.089
A little bit of something,
a little bit of this,

20:57.155 --> 20:58.724
a little bit of that.

20:58.790 --> 20:59.891
I'm looking for all of it.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.193
Alright, listen, I don't
want to get in the way of

21:01.259 --> 21:03.962
the energy here so, welcome.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.263
- Good to meet you.
- Alright.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.232
- Head over to the beach.
- Let's go.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.670
I'm ready to step into Paradise.
I'm excited to meet my one.

21:11.737 --> 21:13.105
And I know she's in there
somewhere.

21:13.171 --> 21:14.706
So, I'm gonna go find her.

21:14.773 --> 21:15.841
- What's up, bro?
- I'm Brendan.

21:15.907 --> 21:17.609
Brendan, nice to meet you, man.
- What's your name?

21:17.676 --> 21:19.811
I want to find someone that
I can connect with,

21:19.878 --> 21:22.114
that I can be with, and that
I can honestly spend

21:22.180 --> 21:23.749
the rest of my life with.

21:23.815 --> 21:26.852
I'm excited to, like, party.
To dance.

21:26.918 --> 21:28.253
I just all of a sudden
got intrigued.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.222
Like, well...

21:30.288 --> 21:32.624
Paradise is amazing.

21:32.691 --> 21:34.259
All the girls walking
down the dock.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.061
Honestly, these girls
got me shook.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.131
Hi! Oh, oh,
are you from Montreal?

21:39.197 --> 21:40.098
- Yeah.
- Me too!

21:40.165 --> 21:42.067
That's why you guys
do the double kiss.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.936
Ana, she's Latina.

21:45.003 --> 21:50.008
Kit, she's tall, she's mystical,
majestic, magical.

21:50.075 --> 21:51.009
We're gonna, we're gonna
ease into it.

21:51.076 --> 21:51.943
We're gonna get comfortable
and everything.

21:52.010 --> 21:55.147
I look really good in a bikini.

21:55.213 --> 21:56.882
These girls got me
flabbergasted.

22:00.419 --> 22:04.690
Lisa! Ah!

22:04.756 --> 22:06.692
It has been so long!

22:06.758 --> 22:09.194
- How are you?
- Oh, my god!

22:09.261 --> 22:11.196
My name is Stacy, and I
was on Chris' season

22:11.263 --> 22:12.931
of The Bachelor Canada.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.033
My first experience
did not work out.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.836
But in Paradise,
anything is possible.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.004
My god, you guys match.

22:19.071 --> 22:22.908
- I'm super excited you're here.
- Oh, yay, good! Ah!

22:22.974 --> 22:23.975
How you doing?
I'm Brendan.

22:24.042 --> 22:25.944
Brendan, nice to meet you.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.181
Brendan M. has
the most amazing eyes.

22:29.247 --> 22:31.650
They're just like
piercingly green.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.251
And I feel like when
he looks at you,

22:33.318 --> 22:35.253
there's just something about
his eyes that make me,

22:35.320 --> 22:38.256
like weak.

22:38.323 --> 22:39.758
He's hot.

22:39.825 --> 22:41.359
My name is Stacy, again,
if you forgot.

22:41.426 --> 22:45.130
- Brendan.
- I remember.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.631
I'd make out with him.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.647
- Is that the next guy?
- Oh, my god.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.349
- Yo, I love it.
- Look at him.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.351
I love it.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.386
- There's the showman.
- No!

23:08.453 --> 23:11.356
Oh, my god. I'm dying.

23:18.196 --> 23:22.701
- Is that the next guy?
- I'm dying. Oh, my god.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.369
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my...

23:24.436 --> 23:25.704
There, there's
the showman.

23:25.771 --> 23:26.638
No!

23:26.705 --> 23:28.740
Hey, how we doing?
I'm Joey. I'm 31.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.375
I live in Medicine Hat,
Alberta,

23:30.442 --> 23:32.144
and I'm currently
working construction.

23:34.112 --> 23:36.715
I love the simplicity of
a small town life.

23:36.782 --> 23:37.916
Sometimes, when
you're in the city,

23:37.983 --> 23:39.718
you can forget what it's like
to work with your hands.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.353
And, that's a good feeling.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.355
It keeps you grounded, it keeps
you levelheaded so,

23:43.422 --> 23:44.990
helping the parents
on the acreage.

23:45.056 --> 23:46.892
Okay, let's see if these
mothercluckers

23:46.958 --> 23:48.360
got any eggs for us.

23:48.426 --> 23:49.995
Mum's got chickens and ducks.

23:50.061 --> 23:51.930
Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.

23:51.997 --> 23:54.766
Oh, look at that!
More eggs!

23:54.833 --> 23:56.468
Puttin' a hard day's work
in is good for the soul.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.303
Breakfast.

24:01.540 --> 24:04.409
When I was a teenager and,
as I was a maturing adult,

24:04.476 --> 24:06.044
I lost two of my
closest friends.

24:06.111 --> 24:10.282
And that definitely changed
how I view the world.

24:10.348 --> 24:13.852
And how I interact with it.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.488
I don't care what you think
about me because

24:16.555 --> 24:19.024
life's too short.
This is me.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.525
If you like it, awesome.
If you don't...

24:20.592 --> 24:22.294
-
- ...couldn't be bothered.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.896
That's your opinion,
that's not my problem.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.365
Shitkickers are not
made for sand.

24:27.432 --> 24:29.434
- Hi, cowboy.
- People?

24:29.501 --> 24:34.506
I haven't been the luckiest
in love, in my life.

24:34.573 --> 24:36.508
But I think the dice might
roll my way this time.

24:36.575 --> 24:38.076
- Kamil.
- Kamil? Nice to meet you.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.311
It ain't my first rodeo either.

24:39.377 --> 24:41.480
That ́a boy, that's what I
like to hear. Fellow cowboy.

24:42.848 --> 24:47.786
He comes in with these pink
Speedos like- I'm like, bro,

24:47.853 --> 24:49.921
there is no rodeo. There's
no bulls, there's no horses.

24:49.988 --> 24:52.190
How we doing?
Hat and boots.

24:52.257 --> 24:55.126
That's bringing Alberta flavour.
Yeehaw!

24:55.193 --> 24:56.494
This guy's great. Look at.

24:56.561 --> 24:57.629
So great.

24:57.696 --> 24:58.830
I'm gonna be in the centre of
whatever's happening,

24:58.897 --> 25:01.366
and if anybody looks like
they're not having a good time,

25:01.433 --> 25:02.834
we're gonna turn that frown...

25:02.901 --> 25:03.969
let's go.

25:04.035 --> 25:04.769
How you doing?
What's your name?

25:04.836 --> 25:06.037
- Joey.
- Joey, nice to meet you.

25:06.104 --> 25:07.005
- I'm Jeremy.
- Brendan, man.

25:07.072 --> 25:08.874
- Brendan?
- Yes.

25:08.940 --> 25:09.908
- Good to see you, bro.
- You too, buddy.

25:09.975 --> 25:12.878
The fact that Joey showed up
here in a Speedo,

25:12.944 --> 25:14.279
I mean, that shows
a lot of balls.

25:15.614 --> 25:16.581
- How are you?
- I'm good.

25:16.648 --> 25:17.983
- Joey.
- Illeana.

25:18.049 --> 25:19.584
It literally shows
a lot of balls.

25:24.456 --> 25:25.624
It's a good-looking
group of guys.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.225
And I'm like worried, I'm like,
are they my competition?

25:27.292 --> 25:28.360
What's going on?

25:28.426 --> 25:30.395
God, I feel like I'm late to
the party here, eh.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.464
Yeah, but you're the...
you're the spice.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.232
Montreal steak spice.

25:34.299 --> 25:35.433
I'm from Montreal, man.
Don't say that.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.434
I'm gonna fall in love with you.

25:36.501 --> 25:38.103
Come on. It's the only
way to go for steak.

25:38.169 --> 25:39.271
I'm gonna fall in love
with you right now!

25:39.337 --> 25:40.538
- I'm just saying, bro.
- Chill!

25:40.605 --> 25:43.174
You know, there's something
about him that I really like.

25:43.241 --> 25:44.276
You know, I came here for love.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.845
-
- So...

25:46.912 --> 25:48.847
Better get on a knee, man!
I ain't playing' games.

25:50.348 --> 25:52.984
I don't think I could rock
his pink Speedo.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.287
But it was definitely a
statement piece.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.255
- Yeehaw!
-

26:02.360 --> 26:05.897
Canada chose me.
I'm ready to fall in love.

26:05.964 --> 26:08.066
And that's what I'm
looking for here.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.502
- Ah-ha-ha, Alice!
- Jesse!

26:10.568 --> 26:12.604
- What's up?
- Ah, so nice to meet you.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.639
So nice to meet you.
Welcome to Paradise.

26:14.706 --> 26:17.208
Thank you. I feel so
grateful for

26:17.275 --> 26:19.978
everyone who voted,
who supported me, and...

26:20.045 --> 26:21.012
- There's your ticket.
- We are ready.

26:21.079 --> 26:21.980
There's your ticket.

26:22.047 --> 26:24.115
Canada, you're not gonna
regret picking me.

26:24.182 --> 26:26.585
I think my husband is
literally right there.

26:26.651 --> 26:29.087
Let's get the journey started.

26:29.154 --> 26:31.389
- Hi!
- Welcome to Paradise.

26:31.456 --> 26:33.091
- How are you?
- So nice to meet you.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.626
- You smell good.
- Do I?

26:34.693 --> 26:36.094
- Yes.
- Thank you.

26:36.161 --> 26:37.028
This is the runway.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.463
You look a pro, with the
heels in the sand.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.131
Do you want to give it
a try as well?

26:40.198 --> 26:41.633
I already did it, 3 times.

26:41.700 --> 26:45.503
Stilettos at the beach?
Of course. Why not?

26:45.570 --> 26:47.038
How you doing?
I'm Joey.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.573
- Nice to meet you, Joey.
- Nice to meet you.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.041
Oh, sorry.
What is that?

26:50.108 --> 26:53.011
- This is...
- A boarding pass?

26:53.078 --> 26:54.946
My ticket.
Do you guys have a ticket?

26:55.013 --> 26:56.548
No. Where are you going?

26:56.615 --> 27:00.452
Alice comes in with her
boarding pass to Paradise.

27:00.518 --> 27:03.521
- Destination Paradise.
- She's here.

27:03.588 --> 27:05.690
It's like, oh, this is so fun.
Canada voted her in.

27:05.757 --> 27:07.592
Oh, man.
I want to dance.

27:07.659 --> 27:09.494
- We should dance.
- We should.

27:09.561 --> 27:12.097
1, 2, 3, 4.

27:12.163 --> 27:15.000
1- oh, your flight.
Or else you're not going home.

27:15.066 --> 27:16.067
Your ass is staying here.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.335
Your ass is
staying here after that.

27:23.274 --> 27:26.578
Do you like
tattoos on people?

27:26.644 --> 27:28.046
Deal breaker?

27:28.113 --> 27:29.581
So, those are your
deal breakers, eh?

27:29.647 --> 27:32.117
- I mean-
- Hey, it's been a pleasure.

27:32.183 --> 27:34.419
I don't, I don't think we'd be
here today if you had

27:34.486 --> 27:36.221
a tattoo on your face.

27:36.287 --> 27:37.422
At this moment, I feel great.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.592
I think, you know, Brendan and
I have made a connection.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.060
There are other people here.

27:42.127 --> 27:43.361
It's one of those things.

27:43.428 --> 27:46.564
But, every conversation that
we have with others,

27:46.631 --> 27:49.467
we keep ending right
back up together.

27:49.534 --> 27:51.269
Like we're obviously
gravitated- like,

27:51.336 --> 27:52.470
I'm gravitated towards you.

27:52.537 --> 27:55.540
All I want to do is go hang out
on the beach with Illeana.

27:55.607 --> 27:59.344
I'm a realist. I'm not scared
to say, "I like, want to pursue.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.545
My eyes are set on you."

28:03.615 --> 28:05.050
so, I mean...

28:05.116 --> 28:07.352
That's basically the only
two options though.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.187
I have tunnel vision at
this point right now.

28:09.254 --> 28:11.723
But, it's Paradise.
Anything could happen.

28:17.662 --> 28:19.698
I literally had so much
time to like create

28:19.764 --> 28:21.232
conspiracy theories
in my head.

28:21.299 --> 28:23.735
I'm waiting to find out
who's the villain.

28:23.802 --> 28:26.337
Lisa...

28:26.404 --> 28:28.106
No, I need to know every
fact and every single thing

28:28.173 --> 28:29.040
that's going on.

28:29.107 --> 28:30.575
Oh, Lisa.

28:30.642 --> 28:31.843
Look at your knee
touching my knee.

28:31.910 --> 28:34.779
- Do you think that's okay?
- Yeah, is that a connection?

28:34.846 --> 28:36.548
Lisa...

28:36.614 --> 28:37.615
She's...

28:37.682 --> 28:39.484
Did you watch our
Canadian season?

28:39.551 --> 28:41.119
- I didn't.
- I haven't.

28:41.186 --> 28:44.155
Ah!

28:44.222 --> 28:45.557
Lisa's gotta calm down.

28:45.623 --> 28:48.259
I'm just trying to help her
relax a little bit.

28:48.326 --> 28:50.295
Would you consider yourself
an outlier?

28:50.361 --> 28:53.565
Oh, for sure. It never felt
like I truly fit in.

28:53.631 --> 28:56.734
You know there's gonna be
people here that are like not...

28:56.801 --> 29:01.740
genuine at all. And I'm just,
I, I can't fake things.

29:01.806 --> 29:05.777
I can't act like I'm into
something if I'm not.

29:05.844 --> 29:09.414
She's talking about, you know,
bad intentions in people and

29:09.481 --> 29:10.715
how the bad always happens.

29:10.782 --> 29:13.351
So far, like, nobody's given me
a problem. I think I'm just

29:13.418 --> 29:15.420
like mentally overanalyzing
and being like,

29:15.487 --> 29:17.355
people are gonna be
pieces of shit.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.290
Imagine somebody
blindsiding you.

29:19.357 --> 29:21.559
Like, I literally
can't fathom that.

29:21.626 --> 29:23.761
I honestly can't believe
it's only the first day and

29:23.828 --> 29:26.297
I've gotten like teary about
it ́cause I didn't even

29:26.364 --> 29:27.599
cry on my own season.

29:27.665 --> 29:28.800
Well, you're crying now.

29:28.867 --> 29:30.635
I'm letting her know
I'm there for her,

29:30.702 --> 29:33.671
but I should focus on the
connections that I'm having.

29:35.907 --> 29:38.476
I'm looking for Caitlin.
Where is she?

29:38.543 --> 29:42.313
Talking to Kamil.
I think this might be a problem.

29:42.380 --> 29:45.550
- Oh, man, Clementine.
- Stressing.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.118
Caitlin's a fun time.

29:47.185 --> 29:49.254
And she's such a
sweet clementine.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.789
That's Caitlin Clemmons.
I call her the clementine.

29:51.856 --> 29:53.258
- I wonder if she'll survive.
- I don't know.

29:53.324 --> 29:56.127
Just this whole thing.
We'll see.

29:56.194 --> 29:57.462
I think it'll be great.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.430
At this point, I'm interested
in getting to know

29:59.497 --> 30:00.598
more about Kamil.

30:00.665 --> 30:03.801
I think we'll have a good time.
And it's finally like...

30:03.868 --> 30:05.870
given us time to get
to know each other.

30:05.937 --> 30:07.172
- I know.
- Cause we've always...

30:07.238 --> 30:08.673
...been like pen pals.

30:08.740 --> 30:12.143
I'm digging Kamil right now.

30:12.210 --> 30:15.413
Hello there, mate.
You guys match.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.484
And, we'll learn more about
Chris.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.419
- See you later, Clementine.
- See ya.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.687
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:22.754 --> 30:24.322
Mm...

30:32.964 --> 30:34.766
The whole situation,
I was just like...

30:34.833 --> 30:35.967
...What a beautiful view.
It's Joey.

30:36.034 --> 30:40.138
- Just like sunset-esque.
- With like the hat silhouette?

30:46.878 --> 30:49.180
- How's everyone doing?
- Good!

30:49.247 --> 30:50.048
Good.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.317
Jesse walks in.
My first impression is,

30:52.383 --> 30:53.518
he's so welcoming.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.688
But, it's Paradise.

30:56.754 --> 30:59.257
Anything can happen here.

30:59.324 --> 31:01.259
Let me fill you in on
how Paradise works.

31:01.326 --> 31:05.430
Each week, there'll be dates.
If you get a date card,

31:05.496 --> 31:08.333
you can ask anyone
you'd like to join you.

31:08.399 --> 31:10.301
There'll also be
rose ceremonies.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.370
If you haven't made a
connection and

31:12.437 --> 31:14.339
you don't receive a rose...

31:14.405 --> 31:17.909
you leave Paradise immediately.

31:17.976 --> 31:21.846
Right now, we have
8 ladies and 6 men.

31:21.913 --> 31:25.483
So, that means, fellas,
you're safe.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.818
For now.

31:26.884 --> 31:29.554
I'm feeling amazing to have
the power of the rose.

31:29.621 --> 31:33.791
This is a real great chance
for me to meet someone that

31:33.858 --> 31:36.461
I've been wanting to meet.

31:36.527 --> 31:40.932
Ladies, unfortunately, the same
can't be said for you.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.501
You're all at risk to
potentially be going home...

31:43.568 --> 31:45.603
at the next rose ceremony.

31:45.670 --> 31:48.473
The guys have the
power this week.

31:48.539 --> 31:51.542
They are giving out the roses.
That means, you know,

31:51.609 --> 31:53.678
if you don't have a
connection by the next

31:53.745 --> 31:57.682
rose ceremony, you will be
leaving Paradise.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.985
Take every advantage
of this opportunity

32:01.052 --> 32:05.990
to be real with each other.
And lastly, have fun with this.

32:06.057 --> 32:07.392
Hell, yeah.

32:07.458 --> 32:09.928
Because Camp Paradise
is officially open.

32:12.997 --> 32:15.400
Have a great night, guys.
Enjoy.

32:15.466 --> 32:17.902
- Thank you!
- It's party time, baby!

32:17.969 --> 32:20.004
It's party time, baby.

32:20.071 --> 32:22.407
♪
Almost paradise. ♪

32:22.473 --> 32:24.976
♪ I'm knocking
at heaven's door! ♪

32:28.646 --> 32:30.782
I'm really open to like what's
going on right now.

32:30.848 --> 32:32.984
And I want to believe
people are good.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.919
And people are genuine.

32:34.986 --> 32:37.021
But I'm definitely gonna be,
like, reserved.

32:37.088 --> 32:39.290
Real country girl now.

32:39.357 --> 32:41.693
Alright, I hate you.
I can't be looking at this.

32:41.759 --> 32:43.761
My self-esteem going woo!

32:43.828 --> 32:45.963
It is what it is.
Some people are pieces of shit.

32:46.030 --> 32:48.800
Some people are pieces of gold.

32:48.866 --> 32:50.768
I do be the gold.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.473
Like, I know like it's
The Bachelor franchise.

32:55.540 --> 32:58.443
Everyone's like, "Oh, I'm here
for love." It's like...

32:58.509 --> 33:00.945
I'm like, actually... unh!

33:01.012 --> 33:02.647
I'm too blunt,
and I'm too pure,

33:02.714 --> 33:05.483
and I'm too honest. It's like
bad for my own good.

33:05.550 --> 33:08.519
I think Lisa, I think
she's in trouble.

33:08.586 --> 33:10.388
Lisa, I'm glad you're here.

33:10.455 --> 33:12.724
Oh-kay!

33:12.790 --> 33:15.827
I'm just so used to guys,
like, burning me.

33:15.893 --> 33:17.628
You put on rose coloured
glasses and you're willing to

33:17.695 --> 33:20.631
like overlook like stupid,
shady things.

33:20.698 --> 33:22.467
And it's like, I know there's
gonna people like that here and

33:22.533 --> 33:24.569
I'm like not equipped
to deal with that.

33:24.635 --> 33:26.504
I feel like you're super strong
and I can see that,

33:26.571 --> 33:27.972
even just having just met you.

33:28.039 --> 33:31.442
And it like grosses me out that
some people are so fake.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.612
And it's just like, I know they
casted pieces of shit for this.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.315
Lisa has already had
a breakdown.

33:37.382 --> 33:39.584
Like some of them are
definitely pieces of shit.

33:39.650 --> 33:42.887
She's crying over things that
haven't even happened yet.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.922
I just don't, I don't
understand.

33:44.989 --> 33:48.593
Like, it's, we haven't been
here long enough for that.

33:48.659 --> 33:51.362
Honestly, I'm so surprised
that I already cried.

33:51.429 --> 33:54.766
I genuinely just feel like a lot
of people are pieces of shit.

33:54.832 --> 33:56.901
And, it might not
be revealed now,

33:56.968 --> 33:59.971
but it's probably gonna
get revealed.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.873
And I can't wait.
I'm honestly good.

34:01.939 --> 34:04.075
I just don't want to be
seen crying on TV.

34:06.978 --> 34:10.681
I don't feel like other people-
Oh, [beep]!

34:10.748 --> 34:12.483
Please tell me that
wasn't on camera.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.829
- Look at how nice this is.
- Cute, eh?

34:24.896 --> 34:26.798
- I just want to steal you away.
- Wow.

34:26.864 --> 34:29.634
Before the end of
the night here.

34:29.700 --> 34:32.170
Illeana is, like,
she's the real deal.

34:32.236 --> 34:36.074
I definitely see us, you know,
going far throughout this

34:36.140 --> 34:38.042
experience, throughout this
amazing journey.

34:38.109 --> 34:39.177
It was a good day.
How do you feel?

34:39.243 --> 34:40.311
- It was a good day.
- Yeah? - Yeah.

34:40.378 --> 34:43.681
I'm just a passionate guy that
knows what he wants.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.818
I know it's still, like,
a long experience.

34:46.884 --> 34:50.021
Right, we've got some
time to go, but...

34:50.088 --> 34:51.189
My eyes are on you.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.559
Regardless of who comes in,
I mean, I'll meet people.

34:54.625 --> 34:55.927
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna...

34:55.993 --> 34:57.795
it's not gonna be the same.

34:57.862 --> 34:59.430
What if someone
invites you on a date?

34:59.497 --> 35:01.766
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- I'll still go.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.569
Absolutely, yeah, yeah.
No, for sure.

35:04.635 --> 35:06.204
But it's like, but that
doesn't mean that

35:06.270 --> 35:07.772
I don't feel the
way you feel.

35:07.839 --> 35:09.874
No matter who you talk to,
I'm like, yeah,

35:09.941 --> 35:11.809
our connection won't go away.
- Right.

35:11.876 --> 35:13.478
It's there, so I'm
confident with that.

35:13.544 --> 35:18.950
I've never met a man who's so
open about his feelings.

35:19.016 --> 35:21.786
Like, he's emotionally
available.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.522
It's strange, right, 'cause
you don't expect

35:24.589 --> 35:27.091
to like make a connection
the first day.

35:27.158 --> 35:28.693
I mean, being with
someone like you,

35:28.759 --> 35:30.228
it's definitely like a
breath of fresh air.

35:30.294 --> 35:32.897
It is. It's been a long
time since like,

35:32.964 --> 35:34.999
I've connected
with someone, like...

35:35.066 --> 35:36.667
on this level, for sure.
It's been a long time.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.703
It just feels like we
know each other.

35:38.769 --> 35:41.005
What was the first thing that
you thought when I walked in?

35:41.072 --> 35:43.641
Oh, my god. You're just...

35:43.708 --> 35:45.710
beautiful.
You're so beautiful.

36:09.967 --> 36:12.270
Last night, we're going to bed,
and we look up and we see,

36:12.336 --> 36:15.172
you know, through the rafters,
this little spider's crawling.

36:15.239 --> 36:16.974
And, I was like, I'm concerned.

36:17.041 --> 36:19.076
Brendan's like,
"He's gonna be fine.

36:19.143 --> 36:20.711
He's gonna stay up there.
He's not gonna trip."

36:20.778 --> 36:23.214
And just as he says that,
the spider, like,

36:23.281 --> 36:25.850
fumbles and falls
and catches itself.

36:29.287 --> 36:32.790
It's the second day in Paradise.
We all had a great first day.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.125
We made some connections.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.260
- We like each other.
- Yeah.

36:36.327 --> 36:40.598
Illeana and Brendan S., they
are definitely coupling up.

36:40.665 --> 36:41.566
We kept talking
to everybody,

36:41.632 --> 36:44.135
but then we kept going
back to each other.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.803
We did.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.071
Yo, what's up?
What's up?

36:47.138 --> 36:50.841
Kamil, he's got his
eye set on...

36:50.908 --> 36:53.077
[Beep]!
I gotta learn these names.

36:53.144 --> 36:55.146
- Hello!
- The party has arrived.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.113
Do you want to squeeze in?

36:56.180 --> 36:58.215
- What's her name?
-

36:58.282 --> 36:59.250
Her and I are
getting married,

36:59.317 --> 37:00.985
so I'm gonna have to
remember it eventually.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.621
Caitlin.
Caitlin, Caitlin.

37:03.688 --> 37:05.222
- Hey, I'm-
- ...for looking out.

37:05.289 --> 37:06.591
- I got ya.
- Gotta look good.

37:07.925 --> 37:10.628
We're both interested in
Caitlin, but I'm feeling good.

37:10.695 --> 37:13.264
We were up, like,
all night, just gossiping.

37:13.331 --> 37:14.398
Yeah?

37:14.465 --> 37:16.934
I'm hoping someone else comes
down that dock and...

37:17.001 --> 37:19.870
locks eyes with Kamil
and he goes for her

37:19.937 --> 37:22.039
instead of Caitlin.
Anything could happen.

37:22.106 --> 37:24.075
Do you think, you think
there'll be a date card?

37:26.077 --> 37:28.079
- Today's unpredictable.
- Yeah.

37:30.147 --> 37:31.949
I feel like there should be on--

37:32.016 --> 37:35.353
Hi, everyone.
Oh, my god.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.722
- Hi!
- Hello!

37:37.788 --> 37:40.024
- How's it going?
- Good.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.293
She's on my real estate team
and we do not get along.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.195
My name is Veronique,
but I do go by Vay.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.296
I'm 31 years' old,

37:45.363 --> 37:47.198
and I'm a real estate agent
in Toronto, Ontario.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.236
Vay and I don't have
a very, like,

37:52.303 --> 37:54.672
chummy relationship back home.

37:54.739 --> 37:57.308
If I had a choice, you know,
we wouldn't be hanging out,

37:57.375 --> 37:58.709
outside of work.

37:58.776 --> 37:59.844
So, my full name's Veronique.

37:59.910 --> 38:01.846
I'm very French,
but I go by Vay.

38:01.912 --> 38:04.615
If I'm not interested in having
someone in my life,

38:04.682 --> 38:07.318
then you best believe you're
not gonna be a part of it.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.353
- Hi, Caitlin. How are you?
- Good, how are you?

38:09.420 --> 38:10.855
How do you two know each other?

38:10.921 --> 38:14.392
- We actually work together.
- Wow! Oh!

38:14.458 --> 38:16.060
- Yeah.
- More real estate.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.295
All I know about Vay and
Caitlin's relationship is they

38:18.362 --> 38:21.065
work together and, apparently,
they don't work well together.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.000
Because, I think we can
all kind of feel

38:23.067 --> 38:24.235
the animosity in the room.

38:24.302 --> 38:28.306
So, I actually have a date card.
"Take a shot with someone".

38:28.372 --> 38:29.774
I like the sound
of this already.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.909
Do any of the guys
want to go chat first?

38:31.976 --> 38:33.711
- I'll chat. Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

38:33.778 --> 38:35.980
So, Vay, that's a
very unique name.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.348
Caitlin, did you know your
friend was coming?

38:37.415 --> 38:40.651
Give us the gossip.
Is there some tension there?

38:40.718 --> 38:43.020
Ah, yeah, we're not,
we're not super close.

38:43.087 --> 38:44.822
Do you all just not
see eye to eye?

38:44.889 --> 38:48.826
It's not a conversation that
needs to be had on TV.

38:48.893 --> 38:51.996
She doesn't need to be on
my radar whatsoever.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.964
I'm not convinced that,
you know,

38:54.031 --> 38:57.134
she's coming here to
really find her person.

38:57.201 --> 39:00.271
- How are you?
- Not good. Yeah, no.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.907
I just need to like
breathe for a second.

39:02.973 --> 39:04.709
Can we go outside?

39:04.775 --> 39:08.179
When Vay walks in,
I can feel a tension in the air.

39:08.245 --> 39:10.014
And it's like a storm's
come into Paradise.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.682
- Can we go for a walk?
- Yeah, let's go.

39:11.749 --> 39:14.318
- Where do you want to go?
- I don't know. Anywhere.

39:14.385 --> 39:17.955
And then I notice Caitlin. It's
a big storm coming to Paradise.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.024
- Wow, that's awkward.
- Right?

39:20.091 --> 39:22.159
Yeah, come here.

39:22.226 --> 39:25.096
I don't want it to be a
competition style

39:25.162 --> 39:26.364
between me and Vay.

39:26.430 --> 39:28.265
I'm not- I don't want to
go through that.

39:28.332 --> 39:30.000
What do you think
the date card is?

39:30.067 --> 39:31.969
Ah, I would love
to enjoy the lake.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.104
I'd like to go on a boat.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.473
Mhm, would you go on the date?
- Since you love boats.

39:35.539 --> 39:38.909
I would love to go on a date
with you, if possible.

39:38.976 --> 39:41.278
Would you go on the
date today with Vay?

39:41.345 --> 39:43.414
With Vay? Ah...

39:43.481 --> 39:46.917
I don't know. I just, I know
you don't like her,

39:46.984 --> 39:49.253
but I really don't-
I don't know,

39:49.320 --> 39:52.022
if she had nobody else to
pick I guess I would.

39:52.089 --> 39:55.760
But like, just to get
to know her. That's it.

39:55.826 --> 39:56.827
Okay.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.162
I just don't know
how I would,

39:58.229 --> 39:59.363
I don't know how
I would take it.

39:59.430 --> 40:01.866
- How do you feel about that?
- I mean...

40:01.932 --> 40:04.835
Would you look at me differently
if I went on a date with her?

40:04.902 --> 40:05.903
Um...

40:05.970 --> 40:08.339
I want someone that's not
going to potentially

40:08.405 --> 40:13.110
take off on me
and go on dates.

40:13.177 --> 40:15.012
I don't know if she would
have that under,

40:15.079 --> 40:17.014
underlying like level of spite,
but...

40:17.081 --> 40:19.150
- Right.
- You never know.

40:19.216 --> 40:20.351
Why, do you think
she would pick me?

40:20.418 --> 40:23.187
- Mhm.
- Just to make you mad?

40:23.254 --> 40:25.456
I mean, I think you're
probably her type.

40:25.523 --> 40:28.926
I think you're a lot of
people's type, but...

40:28.993 --> 40:31.796
Yeah, I just want to meet
everyone. Like, even if...

40:31.862 --> 40:33.798
you know, like, nothing
happens in Paradise,

40:33.864 --> 40:35.432
at least I can say
I met everyone.

40:35.499 --> 40:37.134
I mean, there will be lots
of time to get to

40:37.201 --> 40:38.969
know her after too.
- Yeah, I guess.

40:44.575 --> 40:47.244
- I think I was in Vegas...
- Hey, guys.

40:47.311 --> 40:49.113
- Oh, hey.
- Do you mind if I join you?

40:49.180 --> 40:50.181
- Yeah, come on.
- Absolutely.

40:50.247 --> 40:51.782
- Perfect.
- Got a reserved seat.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.384
I think I have the
first date card,

40:53.451 --> 40:55.019
so this is like an
advantage for me.

40:55.085 --> 40:56.921
So, I'm gonna try my best to
get to know everyone.

40:56.987 --> 40:58.355
Tell me a little bit
about you guys.

40:58.422 --> 41:00.291
Well, I'm originally from
small-town Alberta.

41:00.357 --> 41:02.426
Kind of lived...
all over the place.

41:02.493 --> 41:03.394
I love that.

41:03.460 --> 41:06.063
She's a gorgeous girl.
Does she know it?

41:06.130 --> 41:08.199
But, I'd like to take the time
to maybe get a one on one with

41:08.265 --> 41:10.367
her and see if she can handle
a little bit of Alberta.

41:10.434 --> 41:12.203
This is my third time and,

41:12.269 --> 41:14.038
I feel like third time's
the charm so...

41:14.104 --> 41:15.539
- Well, I'm rooting for you.
- Thank you.

41:15.606 --> 41:17.441
Caitlin is my number
one priority.

41:17.508 --> 41:21.278
But, I'm open to everyone.
I- my heart is open to love.

41:21.345 --> 41:22.546
Does anyone have
questions for me?

41:22.613 --> 41:25.282
- Yeah, let's hear about you.
- Born and raised up north.

41:25.349 --> 41:26.951
Two and a half years ago,
I moved to Toronto.

41:27.017 --> 41:30.087
And that is why I know
one of the girls inside.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.322
- Caitlin.
- Caitlin.

41:31.388 --> 41:33.123
- You guys work together.
- We do, yes.

41:33.190 --> 41:35.125
So, who sells more?
Let's hear it.

41:35.192 --> 41:37.561
We're competitors.

41:37.628 --> 41:38.729
Let's cut to the chase.

41:38.796 --> 41:42.199
Kamil's so, so sexy.
But, let's not tell him that.

41:42.266 --> 41:44.535
I'm gonna play
hard to get a bit.

41:44.602 --> 41:46.470
So, maybe I should
ask this question.

41:46.537 --> 41:49.507
If I were to ask any of you
guys right now to go on a date,

41:49.573 --> 41:51.308
it would be a possibility?

41:54.445 --> 41:56.280
Okay, that's all I
need to know.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.448
There you go.

41:57.514 --> 41:59.316
Well, it was really nice to get
to know all of you guys.

41:59.383 --> 42:01.585
But, I gotta go make a decision
so, we'll talk later?

42:01.652 --> 42:03.120
- Yeah.
- Sounds good!

42:03.187 --> 42:04.421
- See you, Vay.
- Bye.

42:07.391 --> 42:08.592
- Shut up.
-

42:08.659 --> 42:10.094
Why you turning red?

42:10.160 --> 42:12.096
I mean, Paradise is about
meeting new people.

42:12.162 --> 42:14.231
And it's just a date.
I mean, it might go well.

42:14.298 --> 42:15.266
- It might not.
-

42:15.332 --> 42:17.635
It's a tough situation
'cause I do like Caitlin.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.470
And I know she has
a problem with it.

42:19.536 --> 42:21.205
And I don't want to
disappoint anyone, but...

42:21.272 --> 42:22.172
At the end of the day,

42:22.239 --> 42:23.541
you're gonna have to
disappoint someone.

42:23.607 --> 42:24.975
This is part of Paradise,
guys.

42:25.042 --> 42:26.377
This is gonna be interesting.

42:26.443 --> 42:28.512
- Yeah.
- Yes, it is.

42:35.019 --> 42:36.487
I am so ready to
go on this date.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.188
Like, I'm super, super excited.

42:38.255 --> 42:40.190
- Hi, everyone.
- There she is.

42:40.257 --> 42:43.894
I truly want that connection
with someone.

42:43.961 --> 42:45.062
So, I had a lot of
great connections

42:45.129 --> 42:47.998
with everyone here, but...

42:48.065 --> 42:49.600
Kamil, do you want to go
on a date with me?

42:49.667 --> 42:51.168
Why not? Yes.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.136
Perfect.

42:52.202 --> 42:54.271
I picked Kamil because like,
he was the one

42:54.338 --> 42:55.439
who was asking me a
lot of questions.

42:55.506 --> 42:58.242
Like, obviously, he's gorgeous.
He's kind of like a

42:58.309 --> 43:00.177
Rubik's cube that I'm
trying to like figure out.

43:00.244 --> 43:02.012
And I'm like, that's,
that's like my type.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.414
You guys have fun.

43:03.480 --> 43:04.581
- Sorry!
- Absolutely.

43:06.450 --> 43:10.254
I'm very happy for both of them
because now I'm so excited that

43:10.321 --> 43:11.956
I get to spend some
time with Caitlin.

43:12.022 --> 43:14.191
I'm gonna take advantage of
every opportunity with her.

43:14.258 --> 43:15.960
- Bye, guys.
- Bye!

43:16.026 --> 43:17.962
- See ya.
- I didn't plan that.

43:18.028 --> 43:20.297
That was, I mean, it couldn't
be better timing.

43:20.364 --> 43:21.565
Couldn't have been
better timing.

43:21.632 --> 43:23.233
I don't envy Kamil right now.

43:23.300 --> 43:25.603
Kamil's gonna have a choice he
needs to make real quick.

43:25.669 --> 43:28.305
♪ Dun-dun... dun.

43:30.174 --> 43:32.376
My feathers are a little bit
ruffled at this point,

43:32.443 --> 43:35.479
and I'm kind of, you know,
uneasy about it all.

43:35.546 --> 43:39.383
I'm feeling that with Kamil,
there's likely going to be this

43:39.450 --> 43:42.252
underlying level of uncertainty.

43:42.319 --> 43:44.488
I'm feeling a little bit
guarded at this point because

43:44.555 --> 43:47.424
I've been through where
someone's told me that they're

43:47.491 --> 43:50.694
here just for me, and then,
come time for a rose ceremony,

43:50.761 --> 43:53.130
I'm standing there, and they
don't call my name.

43:53.197 --> 43:56.000
Something in my gut tells me...

43:56.066 --> 43:57.635
Kamil would do that to me.

44:08.345 --> 44:09.780
Are you good at golf?

44:09.847 --> 44:12.116
I don't even know what
side I swing on.

44:12.182 --> 44:16.186
I chose Kamil to go on my date
with me 'cause Kamil was

44:16.253 --> 44:19.423
definitely engaging with me
while we all spoke in a group.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.158
And I mean, physically...

44:21.225 --> 44:22.192
can't go wrong.

44:22.259 --> 44:24.461
Here's my wood.

44:26.330 --> 44:29.199
He is exactly what I've
been looking for so,

44:29.266 --> 44:31.101
getting to know him
would be definitely

44:31.168 --> 44:32.503
something I'd want to do.

44:32.569 --> 44:34.138
Alright, you want me to show
you how it's done.

44:34.204 --> 44:35.606
- Yeah.
- Alright, well...

44:35.672 --> 44:37.675
- I'm not much of a golfer.
- Mr. Athletic.

44:37.741 --> 44:39.276
- Yeah, that helps.
- It's like a twerk.

44:39.343 --> 44:41.578
- Yeah.
-

44:41.645 --> 44:44.281
Um...

44:44.348 --> 44:45.616
Alright, so nothing.

44:45.682 --> 44:47.217
Alright, here we go.
Let's see.

44:47.284 --> 44:50.487
Ah, I don't think I can
hit the ball.

44:50.554 --> 44:52.356
Oh!

44:52.423 --> 44:56.527
I am trying to shoot
this ball, and like,

44:56.593 --> 44:59.229
I feel like the stick
should be this big.

44:59.296 --> 45:01.465
That's a big enough driver.
You've got a little ball.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.801
- I need a bigger one.
- You need a bigger one?

45:03.867 --> 45:06.070
Wow.

45:06.136 --> 45:08.806
So, you put your
right hand lower.

45:08.872 --> 45:10.274
- Okay.
- Left hand here.

45:10.340 --> 45:11.308
Oh, my god. This is like
embarrassing.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.243
- Step closer.
- Well, I hope so.

45:13.310 --> 45:16.180
You need the movement, like,
from here, up.

45:16.246 --> 45:19.349
And then,
release. Oh!

45:19.416 --> 45:22.186
-
- Well done.

45:22.252 --> 45:26.256
I am not one to kiss
this early on in a date.

45:26.323 --> 45:29.159
Like, this is not
something I do.

45:29.226 --> 45:30.227
- Sorry.
- Wow.

45:30.294 --> 45:32.196
I guess that's a kiss.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.502
But I mean, we are in Paradise.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.704
Alright, so let's play-
let's change the rules up.

45:42.639 --> 45:45.509
We'll let fate decide.

45:45.576 --> 45:46.543
- A dare?
- Yeah.

45:46.610 --> 45:49.780
- That was a dare.
- I dare you...

45:49.847 --> 45:51.882
to show me...

45:51.949 --> 45:54.184
...how much you like me.

45:54.251 --> 45:56.787
Hm.

46:01.959 --> 46:02.893
Okay, wow.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.828
I feel a connection with Kamil.

46:04.895 --> 46:07.898
I feel like we're very
on the same level.

46:07.965 --> 46:09.733
I do know that he has a
connection with Caitlin

46:09.800 --> 46:12.603
as well, but at the end of
the day, if he's my guy,

46:12.669 --> 46:14.204
nothing's gonna stop...

46:14.271 --> 46:16.173
whether or not he has a
connection with someone else.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.574
- Let's do it.
- Oh.

46:17.641 --> 46:20.310
Alright, here we go.
1...

46:22.813 --> 46:25.549
Better make this one count.
Like, I'm, I'm letting you know.

46:25.616 --> 46:29.686
The kiss had to happen.
And I'm not upset about it.

46:29.753 --> 46:31.622
And the second kiss
needed to happen.

46:31.688 --> 46:35.626
And the third, and the fourth.
They all just needed to happen.

46:35.692 --> 46:36.894
I think it ended up being

46:36.960 --> 46:39.196
exactly what it
was supposed to be.

46:43.867 --> 46:46.503
- Just a little roomie update.
- What's going on?

46:46.570 --> 46:48.205
How's everyone's day been?

46:48.272 --> 46:51.508
Cabin 24 unite. You know,
me Illeana and Caitlin.

46:51.575 --> 46:54.645
Whenever we see one of us
struggling, we're there.

46:54.711 --> 46:58.715
What do we think about
today's events?

46:58.782 --> 47:01.718
I feel like I'm dealing
with a lot right now.

47:01.785 --> 47:05.322
The last thing I want is to
be involved in some

47:05.389 --> 47:09.493
ridiculous love triangle
between a guy and Vay.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.728
I hate that for you.
Honestly.

47:11.795 --> 47:15.199
It sucks that it's her, but...

47:15.265 --> 47:17.401
You said you and Kamil
had like a good chat,

47:17.467 --> 47:18.869
before he went on the date?

47:18.936 --> 47:22.506
Yeah, it was, I mean, a
little bit reassuring I guess.

47:22.573 --> 47:25.909
I don't want to be led astray.

47:25.976 --> 47:27.778
I think it just felt
overwhelming because

47:27.844 --> 47:30.881
I had to take in like all
the emotions of...

47:30.948 --> 47:33.350
her coming here.
How are you guys feeling?

47:33.417 --> 47:35.719
Do you feel good about
getting Brendan S.'s rose?

47:35.786 --> 47:37.321
I mean, I feel good about it.

47:37.387 --> 47:38.922
But like I said, I just like to
live in the moment.

47:38.989 --> 47:41.258
Who are you digging?
Have you talked to Brendan?

47:41.325 --> 47:43.427
Yeah, we had a
long chat earlier.

47:43.493 --> 47:45.295
It was cute.
He was like, saying, like,

47:45.362 --> 47:46.897
"Maybe talked about you
a little bit today".

47:46.964 --> 47:47.998
Aw.

47:48.065 --> 47:50.767
"Maybe talked about you too."
It's so cheesy.

47:50.834 --> 47:54.471
Brendan M. and I seem to have a
lot in common so far, which is,

47:54.538 --> 47:56.640
it's like, we keep like-
are we the same person?

47:56.707 --> 47:58.976
It's weird, in a good way.

47:59.042 --> 48:01.345
Dude, you have the
biggest crush right now.

48:01.411 --> 48:03.647
She does!
She's so crushing on him.

48:03.714 --> 48:06.650
-
- No, I'm not you, guys.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.452
Should we cheers?
Let's cheers.

48:08.518 --> 48:09.920
Cheers to finding love.

48:09.987 --> 48:12.923
Cheers to finding
love and friends. Woo!

48:19.396 --> 48:21.331
- Channel it out.
- Doesn't mean anything.

48:21.398 --> 48:22.866
- Channel it out.
- Yeah.

48:25.869 --> 48:28.372
Brendan M. and I have had quite
a few good conversations,

48:28.438 --> 48:30.307
so I'm really excited to see
where this one goes and

48:30.374 --> 48:32.442
if we can develop our connection
a little bit further.

48:34.411 --> 48:36.346
This is gonna be really
pretty with the sunset.

48:36.413 --> 48:37.981
- I know.
- Will you watch it with me?

48:38.048 --> 48:39.216
I will.

48:39.283 --> 48:43.587
Like if we dive in here and, and
do all the right next steps,

48:43.654 --> 48:46.023
I can see how this would work.

48:46.089 --> 48:48.792
Obviously, you and I
have been...

48:48.859 --> 48:52.529
you know, spending some time
together these past two days.

48:52.596 --> 48:54.531
There's definitely a good
connection here, I think.

48:54.598 --> 48:55.599
I think so.

48:55.666 --> 48:57.701
Yeah, how do you feel about
everything that's...

48:57.768 --> 48:58.969
been going on so far?

48:59.036 --> 49:02.773
I think the person that I want
to get to know right now is you.

49:02.839 --> 49:04.808
Yeah, I mean, I agree with you.

49:04.875 --> 49:05.909
I think we have great chemistry.

49:06.009 --> 49:08.745
I think we have a great
connection starting to form.

49:08.812 --> 49:10.881
And it makes me feel hopeful.

49:18.121 --> 49:19.723
Um...

49:21.124 --> 49:23.427
Is that Stacy, or is it?
Who is he with?

49:23.493 --> 49:24.895
Oh, it's Stacy.

49:26.797 --> 49:29.900
- Okay, well I did not see-
- Me either.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.502
I did not see that happening
over there. Did you?

49:32.569 --> 49:33.704
- No.
- Hm.

49:33.770 --> 49:36.807
It's super frustrating to
see Stacy and Brendan M. kiss.

49:36.873 --> 49:39.609
I was feeling pretty
confident and then...

49:39.676 --> 49:43.747
see them out there
and I'm like...

49:43.814 --> 49:48.518
That kiss was not what
I wanted to see, so...

49:48.585 --> 49:50.454
I'm caught off guard by that.

49:50.520 --> 49:51.321
How are you feeling?

49:51.388 --> 49:55.592
I have to stay confident
in myself, so...

49:55.659 --> 49:58.962
we'll see what happens.

49:59.029 --> 50:00.530
Should we jump in the water,
just like...?

50:00.597 --> 50:02.699
- Cool down a little.
- Yeah, my head is- ah.

50:02.766 --> 50:04.434
I'm excited.

50:04.501 --> 50:07.771
I agree.
Yeah, we're good.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.873
Everything's fine.
We're good.

50:09.940 --> 50:12.442
- You're great.
- Yeah.

50:22.018 --> 50:23.954
- It's really cute out here.
- It is.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.822
- Maybe you should pop the...
- The bubbles?

50:25.889 --> 50:27.491
Yeah. You know,
we've kissed six times,

50:27.557 --> 50:30.727
so maybe popping the champagne
is necessary.

50:30.794 --> 50:31.995
Okay.

50:32.062 --> 50:36.066
Veronique, she's very outgoing.
Aesthetically, she's beautiful.

50:36.133 --> 50:39.069
Like, she also has these
piercing blue eyes, brunette.

50:39.136 --> 50:42.105
Like, nice body,
like... sporty.

50:42.172 --> 50:45.041
What I want to know is, like,
what she came here for.

50:45.108 --> 50:47.544
I don't know if she's here
to meet someone,

50:47.611 --> 50:49.679
or if she's here to maybe,
you know,

50:49.746 --> 50:53.016
offset Caitlin's chances of
meeting someone.

50:53.083 --> 50:55.886
Cheers to that.

50:55.952 --> 51:01.057
My big question to you is,
the whole thing with

51:01.124 --> 51:03.760
you and Caitlin. And,
I feel like she's like

51:03.827 --> 51:06.530
the sweet, innocent
clementine.

51:06.596 --> 51:09.166
What's the bad beef
between you two?

51:09.232 --> 51:12.035
So, I honestly...

51:12.102 --> 51:14.771
have no idea why Caitlin
doesn't like me.

51:14.838 --> 51:17.207
I know for a fact I've never
done anything to that girl.

51:17.274 --> 51:19.076
For someone to not
like me and not-

51:19.142 --> 51:21.044
and me not know why,
it is bothersome.

51:21.111 --> 51:22.179
It is, yeah.
That would bother me.

51:22.245 --> 51:24.915
- Like, tremendously.
- And like, why, what did I do?

51:24.981 --> 51:27.017
Like, just tell me,
use your words.

51:27.083 --> 51:29.119
I got a gut feeling that
there's a lot of drama coming.

51:29.186 --> 51:31.822
And, I don't want to be
caught in the crossfire,

51:31.888 --> 51:34.991
so I'm trying to stay neutral
like Switzerland here.

51:35.058 --> 51:37.561
Or, Canada, obviously.

51:37.627 --> 51:40.030
If you're gonna get to know us
both, we are opposite.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.866
So, if you like her, I'm
probably not the girl for you.

51:42.933 --> 51:45.101
Or if you like me, she's
probably not the girl for you

51:45.168 --> 51:47.737
because like, I do know her
more than you do.

51:47.804 --> 51:49.005
And we're just...

51:49.072 --> 51:52.542
two completely different people.
And I think that's why we clash.

51:52.609 --> 51:55.178
I could be tempted.
It's like Adam and Eve.

51:55.245 --> 51:56.913
I mean, they wouldn't have
ate the apple

51:56.980 --> 51:58.114
if they weren't
hungry, right?

51:58.181 --> 51:59.850
And I'm hungry to meet someone.

51:59.916 --> 52:02.886
- So, Veronique...
- I love how you say my name.

52:02.953 --> 52:05.188
I mean, I like the way it
slips off my tongue.

52:05.255 --> 52:07.057
- It's like, "Ver-neek".
- I do, too.

52:07.123 --> 52:10.660
So, thank you again
for bringing me. Cheers.

52:10.727 --> 52:11.895
To everything happening
for a reason.

52:11.962 --> 52:13.797
Yes, good motto.

52:21.304 --> 52:24.174
- Dangerous.
-

52:27.644 --> 52:30.881
- Who are we watching?
- Love in Paradise.

52:30.947 --> 52:33.216
Caitlin's beautiful.
She's so smart.

52:33.283 --> 52:35.919
She's career driven.
She's on a mission.

52:35.986 --> 52:38.355
And this is exactly what
I've been looking for.

52:38.421 --> 52:40.257
I'm really into this girl.

52:40.323 --> 52:42.792
We're creeping on everyone
over here, on our perch.

52:42.859 --> 52:46.596
We're seeing what's happening.

52:46.663 --> 52:48.131
What's up?
How are ya?

52:48.198 --> 52:50.267
I'm good.
Um, can I...

52:50.333 --> 52:51.535
I'm gonna steal her away.

52:51.601 --> 52:54.905
I am so intrigued by Caitlin,
I'm gonna take advantage of

52:54.971 --> 52:56.840
every opportunity with her.

52:56.907 --> 52:58.375
- How are you?
- I'm alright.

52:58.441 --> 53:01.177
I like, I feel a lot better now.

53:01.244 --> 53:03.113
Okay.

53:03.179 --> 53:05.749
This morning was a little,
a little overwhelming.

53:05.815 --> 53:07.717
Okay, well,
I guess I'll take off then.

53:07.784 --> 53:08.919
- Okay.
- No, I'm just kidding.

53:08.985 --> 53:11.755
I feel good that
you're here, duh.

53:11.821 --> 53:13.924
That's good, like, let's talk
about the elephant in the room.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.763
- What?
- Well, you had a hard day.

53:19.829 --> 53:21.631
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:21.698 --> 53:23.333
I was like super
comfortable yesterday.

53:23.400 --> 53:27.237
It felt like I'm vibing, like,
with you guys and like...

53:27.304 --> 53:29.105
it felt good.
I felt comfortable here.

53:29.172 --> 53:32.375
And then, that kind of like
just shook me a little bit.

53:35.145 --> 53:37.314
What?!

53:37.380 --> 53:41.217
- I could feel... the tension.
- Yeah.

53:41.284 --> 53:43.954
- I think everyone could.
- Yeah.

53:44.020 --> 53:46.222
But, I just want to make sure
you're in a good space.

53:46.289 --> 53:48.091
How are you feeling?
How's your day been?

53:48.158 --> 53:48.925
I was looking for you
everywhere.

53:48.992 --> 53:50.961
- Aw.
- Not gonna lie.

53:51.027 --> 53:52.929
- Well, we're here now.
- Yeah.

53:57.834 --> 54:00.103
I'm looking at Caitlin.

54:00.170 --> 54:03.239
And I'm seeing visions of us

54:03.306 --> 54:05.408
hanging out in the
park with our kids.

54:07.410 --> 54:10.246
What?

54:10.313 --> 54:14.751
I'm seeing her as like the
mother to my children.

54:14.818 --> 54:18.121
- The sunset's pretty.
- Mhm.

54:18.188 --> 54:21.191
Like I... I love sunsets.

54:21.257 --> 54:24.894
And now, we're here.
And here is a good place to be.

54:24.961 --> 54:27.797
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:27.864 --> 54:29.399
- Come here.
- Right?

54:39.376 --> 54:40.443
Here's a good place to be.

54:40.510 --> 54:42.412
It sure is.

54:45.181 --> 54:48.084
Wow.
Wow.

54:48.151 --> 54:50.887
It feels good to have someone
in my corner today.

54:50.954 --> 54:54.958
Yeah, I mean, I'm...
I'm a fighter.

54:55.025 --> 54:59.429
Chris kind of was feeling like
a safe space for me.

54:59.496 --> 55:03.767
But, when I kissed Chris
that was just kind of like

55:03.833 --> 55:05.735
forced and a
little unnatural.

55:05.802 --> 55:09.139
It wasn't the same feeling that
I was having for Kamil.

55:09.205 --> 55:11.741
That kind of speaks volumes.

55:11.808 --> 55:14.844
- How's your canoe game?
- What?

55:18.415 --> 55:22.252
I'm looking at Caitlin as a
real potential partner.

55:22.318 --> 55:24.854
I, I can't stop
thinking about her.

55:24.921 --> 55:26.923
What are your thoughts?

55:26.990 --> 55:28.925
Chris, he's a really nice guy.

55:28.992 --> 55:33.163
It's still so early on, and I
don't want to fully invest.

55:33.229 --> 55:36.066
- We kissed.
- You, you did?

55:36.132 --> 55:39.102
We've connected on a,
on an emotional level.

55:39.169 --> 55:42.305
On a goal-oriented level.
On a physical level.

55:42.372 --> 55:43.840
- I did not know.
- Mhm.

55:43.907 --> 55:47.043
- Give me the T.
- That is the T.

55:47.110 --> 55:51.848
I'm fortunate enough to be able
to keep myself protected by

55:51.915 --> 55:55.285
indulging Chris because
he's there and he's,

55:55.351 --> 55:57.253
obviously, interested in me.

55:57.320 --> 55:59.022
You don't know what's gonna
happen with Kamil.

55:59.089 --> 56:00.457
I think you should
just be open

56:00.523 --> 56:02.926
to exploring the
possibility of both.

56:02.992 --> 56:04.127
This is my person.

56:04.194 --> 56:06.863
This is who I'm definitely
giving a rose to this week.

56:06.930 --> 56:08.531
So, the kiss was...?

56:08.598 --> 56:13.069
Oh, no.

56:13.136 --> 56:15.105
Um...

56:15.171 --> 56:17.440
I don't know, I don't know.

56:21.644 --> 56:23.913
Okay.

56:33.957 --> 56:34.858
Angela.

56:34.924 --> 56:36.993
Angela was actually the
first person I noticed

56:37.060 --> 56:38.294
when I came here.

56:38.361 --> 56:41.030
I didn't have an opportunity to
speak with her as much as I did

56:41.097 --> 56:43.600
with Stacy so, it will be nice
to get to know her a little bit

56:43.666 --> 56:46.569
more and just see if there's
something there.

56:46.636 --> 56:47.637
Oh, my god.

56:47.704 --> 56:49.372
- This has been great.
- I know.

56:53.376 --> 56:54.444
-
- Today.

56:54.511 --> 56:56.413
- Yeah, I was wondering.
- I would have scooped you.

56:56.479 --> 56:58.581
- Oh, my gosh.
- I would have.

56:58.648 --> 57:01.217
Brendan M. spent all
morning with Stacy.

57:01.284 --> 57:03.653
But that's why we're here,
is to talk to people and

57:03.720 --> 57:07.157
get to know people.
That's the premise of Paradise.

57:07.223 --> 57:08.458
And besides, you owe me.

57:08.525 --> 57:10.360
I did give you a nice little
piggyback, so...

57:10.427 --> 57:11.327
- Oh, okay.
- It's only right.

57:11.394 --> 57:13.296
- I owe you a date.
- It's only right.

57:13.363 --> 57:17.967
But I just gotta stay confident
and focus on my own stuff.

57:18.034 --> 57:21.938
And then, try to deal as best I
can with outside forces.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.974
- Would you?
- Mhm.

57:25.041 --> 57:26.509
Well, I guess we'll see
what happens tomorrow.

57:26.576 --> 57:28.144
I guess we'll see
what happens.

57:28.211 --> 57:30.413
-
- Oh, my god.

57:30.480 --> 57:32.549
If you saw me, like,
in real life,

57:32.615 --> 57:34.184
would you come up to me or no?

57:34.250 --> 57:35.518
Yeah.

57:35.585 --> 57:37.520
I'm really enjoying
connecting with Angela.

57:37.587 --> 57:39.589
She's just so easy to talk to.

57:39.656 --> 57:42.458
And we're connecting
on another level.

57:42.525 --> 57:46.262
I'm very picky. And like,
I normally don't...

57:46.329 --> 57:50.667
like, vibe with people
like this, like...

57:50.733 --> 57:51.701
it's crazy.

57:51.768 --> 57:54.671
- This is very rare.
- Mhm. Yeah.

57:54.737 --> 57:57.040
Oh, my gosh.
Are you crying?

57:57.106 --> 57:58.575
- No, I'm not crying.
-

57:58.641 --> 58:00.076
You're so happy you're
tearing up?

58:00.143 --> 58:02.245
My eyes, I think there's
like something that

58:02.312 --> 58:04.214
just went in my eyes.
- Seriously?

58:04.280 --> 58:05.448
- Yeah.
- Let me see.

58:05.515 --> 58:08.051
Oh, [beep]!

58:08.117 --> 58:10.420
I'm ruining the moment. Let me
just like let my eye twitch

58:10.487 --> 58:13.456
as I just like stare
at you.

58:13.523 --> 58:16.226
Just flickering like this.

58:17.794 --> 58:19.362
You're so emotional.

58:30.106 --> 58:32.675
On a scale of one to ten,
Angela is...

58:32.742 --> 58:35.578
yeah, she's up there
for kissing.

58:35.645 --> 58:38.615
Probably have to get
another scale, actually.

58:38.681 --> 58:42.085
Mm. Hi.

58:42.151 --> 58:44.254
- That was nice.
- I agree.

58:44.320 --> 58:47.090
So far, on Paradise,
I have kissed two girls.

58:47.156 --> 58:49.525
I can't just be out here,
you know, Rico Suave,

58:49.592 --> 58:50.727
with two girls on my hip.

58:50.793 --> 58:52.462
But I, I really want
to make sure that

58:52.528 --> 58:53.463
I'm making the
right decision.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.632
This is Paradise.
We're here to figure out

58:55.698 --> 58:57.634
who we're a ma-
made for, I guess.

58:57.700 --> 59:00.637
So, I'm, I'm keeping my
options somewhat open.

59:00.703 --> 59:02.572
-
- Your eye's not twitching.

59:02.639 --> 59:05.575
- My eye is perfect now.
- Oh, it's perfect, I fixed it?

59:05.642 --> 59:07.210
Yeah.

59:13.816 --> 59:15.585
Hey, guys.
I got a card.

59:15.652 --> 59:18.454
Hey! Let's hear it.
Come on, buddy.

59:18.521 --> 59:20.123
"Tonight, you will have the
chance to get to

59:20.189 --> 59:22.191
know each other on
a deeper level.

59:22.258 --> 59:23.559
When the sun goes down,

59:23.626 --> 59:26.195
head to the fire at the
end of the beach.

59:26.262 --> 59:28.164
Open the envelope
addressed to you and

59:28.231 --> 59:30.433
read the question inside.

59:30.500 --> 59:34.037
You can direct it to any
individual, or the group.

59:34.103 --> 59:35.738
Your choice.

59:35.805 --> 59:39.475
Be honest."

59:44.581 --> 59:47.750
- What turns you on?
- Oh.

59:47.817 --> 59:50.286
I'm gonna ask Jeremy.

59:50.353 --> 59:55.224
I like, you know, neck kissing
and all that little cute stuff.

59:55.291 --> 59:57.460
The little lovey dove stuff,
I like that, you know.

1:00:00.163 --> 1:00:01.731
- Just for, just for-
- Hello!

1:00:01.798 --> 1:00:03.499
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.

1:00:03.566 --> 1:00:05.435
- Hey, friends.
- Wow, this is nice and warm.

1:00:05.501 --> 1:00:08.504
Yeah, this is really cozy.
I'm gonna sit right here.

1:00:08.571 --> 1:00:11.441
As soon as Vay walks in the
room with Kamil,

1:00:11.507 --> 1:00:13.476
I find a really
uncomfortable vibe.

1:00:13.543 --> 1:00:16.746
You can kind of just cut the
tension with a knife.

1:00:16.813 --> 1:00:20.450
I know things are
about to go down.

1:00:20.516 --> 1:00:25.288
Was there a kiss?

1:00:25.355 --> 1:00:27.657
Um, yeah, we kissed, yeah.

1:00:29.792 --> 1:00:34.731
This experience can really
show people's true colours.

1:00:34.797 --> 1:00:38.835
Vay is a little bit more
abrasive and...

1:00:38.901 --> 1:00:40.336
aggressive.

1:00:40.403 --> 1:00:43.106
It's only a matter of time
before you get to see

1:00:43.172 --> 1:00:45.174
people's real personalities.

1:00:45.241 --> 1:00:46.643
I honestly think they put
the kiss thing

1:00:46.709 --> 1:00:48.478
the closest on purpose.

1:00:49.646 --> 1:00:51.581
Good.

1:00:51.648 --> 1:00:53.149
Yeah, so we played golf.

1:00:53.216 --> 1:00:56.586
And then, we had some champagne
and just, just chatted.

1:00:56.652 --> 1:00:58.287
Got to know each other
lot better, so...

1:00:58.354 --> 1:00:59.789
- Nice.
- It was... It was cute.

1:00:59.856 --> 1:01:02.425
- Overall, a great date.
- Really was.

1:01:02.492 --> 1:01:03.593
I do want to see how
this plays out ́cause

1:01:03.659 --> 1:01:06.529
I like a good cat fight.

1:01:06.596 --> 1:01:07.897
Meow.

1:01:12.502 --> 1:01:15.171
Stay tuned for highlights from
<i>the first ever season of</i>

1:01:15.238 --> 1:01:16.706
<i>Bachelor in Paradise Canada.</i>

1:01:19.242 --> 1:01:23.746
<i>This season, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada...</i>

1:01:23.813 --> 1:01:26.783
Woohoo!

1:01:26.849 --> 1:01:27.884
Camp Paradise!

1:01:27.950 --> 1:01:31.587
- I always wanted to go camp.
- Paradise is amazing.

1:01:31.654 --> 1:01:34.757
Woo! Woo!
That was so cool!

1:01:34.824 --> 1:01:37.593
I'm so glad to be at
a summer camp.

1:01:37.660 --> 1:01:38.961
It's like being a kid again.

1:01:40.830 --> 1:01:43.566
Hard, hard, hard!

1:01:43.633 --> 1:01:46.769
I'm just feeling good.

1:01:46.836 --> 1:01:48.438
Oh!

1:01:48.504 --> 1:01:50.706
- When you know, you nose.
- Mhm.

1:01:50.773 --> 1:01:52.842
Queens!

1:01:52.909 --> 1:01:54.310
King and queen.

1:01:54.377 --> 1:01:56.379
How do you spell Paradise?
L-O-V-E, baby.

1:01:56.446 --> 1:01:57.680
Oh!

1:01:59.682 --> 1:02:02.919
It's like my childhood
summer camp experience

1:02:02.985 --> 1:02:04.887
has just come to life.

1:02:04.954 --> 1:02:06.556
Ah!

1:02:06.622 --> 1:02:08.858
It feels like I'm like at
camp in high school.

1:02:08.925 --> 1:02:11.327
We just talk about who's cute
and who has the nicer abs.

1:02:13.062 --> 1:02:17.433
Wow, those extra-large protein
meals are helping.

1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:19.435
I don't know, there's a few men
that need to catch up.

1:02:20.737 --> 1:02:22.605
<i>Get ready for a long...</i>

1:02:22.672 --> 1:02:24.607
- Like this?
- Oh, god.

1:02:24.674 --> 1:02:25.608
<i>Hot...</i>

1:02:25.675 --> 1:02:28.277
What is happening in Paradise?

1:02:28.344 --> 1:02:29.645
<i>Canadian...</i>

1:02:29.712 --> 1:02:31.447
Yes! Ha!

1:02:31.514 --> 1:02:33.916
<i>Summer.</i>

1:02:33.983 --> 1:02:36.586
I'm falling in love with him.

1:02:36.652 --> 1:02:38.454
I really care about that girl.

1:02:38.521 --> 1:02:42.391
He's gone out of his way to make
me feel special and loved.

1:02:42.458 --> 1:02:44.727
I have found love.

1:02:44.794 --> 1:02:47.730
I'm so ready for
my happy ending.

1:02:47.797 --> 1:02:49.599
I look at her and it's just...

1:02:49.665 --> 1:02:52.535
everything else disappears.

1:02:52.602 --> 1:02:55.338
Not right here, no.

1:02:55.404 --> 1:02:57.006
No...

1:02:57.073 --> 1:03:01.511
- Oh, my god!
- What's going on?

1:03:01.577 --> 1:03:04.313
Oh my god,
I can't stand her.

1:03:04.380 --> 1:03:06.883
She's gonna literally attack me.

1:03:06.949 --> 1:03:08.784
You can tell a storm is coming.

1:03:08.851 --> 1:03:11.420
It's too quiet out here. There's
always a storm rolling in.

1:03:11.487 --> 1:03:13.589
It's always the calm
before the storm here.

1:03:13.656 --> 1:03:16.058
The hardest part
about dating you...

1:03:19.562 --> 1:03:21.998
I think that a storm is brewing.

1:03:22.064 --> 1:03:24.600
I just need a man who can
use his brain and

1:03:24.667 --> 1:03:26.502
answer the questions.

1:03:28.104 --> 1:03:30.473
They had a talk with Kamil,

1:03:30.540 --> 1:03:33.309
about how you're
really not her type.

1:03:33.376 --> 1:03:34.944
Little snake, man.

1:03:35.011 --> 1:03:36.846
Oh, I'm gonna show him
Paradise.

1:03:36.913 --> 1:03:39.348
I don't care if you're a
space cowboy or

1:03:39.415 --> 1:03:42.451
a space whatever you are.
Like, I don't care.

1:03:42.518 --> 1:03:47.490
In this scenario, you have a
stud horse in the pasture...

1:03:47.557 --> 1:03:49.091
and you've got a mare.

1:03:49.158 --> 1:03:51.794
And there's a coyote scaring
the mare. And I'll tell you

1:03:51.861 --> 1:03:54.931
what's gonna be left of the
face of the coyote...

1:03:54.997 --> 1:03:56.566
not so much.

1:03:56.632 --> 1:03:58.668
I think he's a piece of [beep],
to be honest with you.

1:03:58.734 --> 1:03:59.635
I just don't want to
talk to him.

1:03:59.702 --> 1:04:01.037
I don't like the fact that
the only person

1:04:01.103 --> 1:04:02.238
I'm talking to is you.

1:04:02.305 --> 1:04:05.474
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me.

1:04:05.541 --> 1:04:07.944
He is not a good guy.

1:04:08.010 --> 1:04:09.679
She's not your girl.

1:04:09.745 --> 1:04:12.481
The connection is terminated.
You're gone, delete.

1:04:12.548 --> 1:04:14.383
You're a rooster.
I'm a gorilla.

1:04:14.450 --> 1:04:16.118
Sit your ass down.

1:04:16.185 --> 1:04:18.921
I'm not just gonna let
someone walk over me.

1:04:18.988 --> 1:04:21.657
You do put your trust in
somebody that you thought

1:04:21.724 --> 1:04:25.728
you were close to and, like,
it could blow up in your face.

1:04:25.795 --> 1:04:27.663
You're in this constant drama.

1:04:27.730 --> 1:04:30.633
When I feel like someone
just wants to do whatever

1:04:30.700 --> 1:04:33.736
I want all the time,
I want to, like, run.

1:04:33.803 --> 1:04:36.372
- It's okay.
- I'm just not ready.

1:04:36.439 --> 1:04:39.909
I don't want to...
fall back in that hole.

1:04:44.580 --> 1:04:48.117
I hate that I'm the one that
made her feel this way.

1:04:48.184 --> 1:04:50.887
[Beep]!
Love sucks.

1:04:50.953 --> 1:04:52.588
<i>We're coming in hot...</i>

1:04:52.655 --> 1:04:53.856
Wow, with the ice skates.

1:04:53.923 --> 1:04:54.957
<i>This season.</i>

1:04:55.024 --> 1:04:56.492
Are they kissing?

1:04:56.559 --> 1:04:58.527
On Bachelor in Paradise Canada.

1:04:58.594 --> 1:04:59.695
Woo!

1:04:59.762 --> 1:05:01.664
This is mind blowing.
It's literally mind blowing.

1:05:01.731 --> 1:05:03.399
Like, it's just a
conversation that

1:05:03.466 --> 1:05:05.568
turned into an
epic battle.

1:05:07.069 --> 1:05:09.772
- What does your heart say?
- No.

1:05:09.839 --> 1:05:12.541
nightmare to me.

1:05:14.610 --> 1:05:16.712
Anything can happen at
Camp Paradise.

1:05:19.248 --> 1:05:23.052
- Stacy's laugh...
- Ah! Ha-ha-ha!

1:05:23.119 --> 1:05:27.156
- Stacy has a very...
- Very distinctive laugh.

1:05:27.223 --> 1:05:29.091
Ah-ha-ha!

1:05:29.158 --> 1:05:32.561
Hundred yards across the beach,
you can hear Stacy laugh.

1:05:32.628 --> 1:05:34.797
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Ah-ha-ha!

1:05:34.864 --> 1:05:36.165
-
- I can't do it.

1:05:36.232 --> 1:05:38.034
- Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-

1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:39.168
That's so bad.

1:05:39.235 --> 1:05:42.438
- Hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Ha-haa!

1:05:42.505 --> 1:05:44.707
- Ha-ha-ah!
-

1:05:44.774 --> 1:05:46.976
Ah-haaaaaa!

1:05:47.043 --> 1:05:49.745
It's like a lower octave and
then like a higher octave.

1:05:49.812 --> 1:05:51.480
Ha-ha-ha-haaaa!

1:05:51.547 --> 1:05:54.150
It just one of those
unique laughs that

1:05:54.216 --> 1:05:55.818
you cannot help but to love.

1:05:55.885 --> 1:05:57.720
You're gonna have like a
montage of clips of

1:05:57.787 --> 1:05:59.622
all of us trying to do
Stacy's laugh.
