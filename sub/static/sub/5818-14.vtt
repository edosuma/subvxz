DAMON: Previously on
The Vampire Diaries...

00:04.640 --> 00:05.687
(ENZO GRUNTS)

00:06.440 --> 00:07.441
What the hell did you do?

00:07.600 --> 00:10.809
I can't protect Mystic Falls on my own
so I made some friends that could help.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.286
Who are these friends?

00:12.440 --> 00:13.930
Alaric's babies
are the future of the coven.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.445
They're inside of you.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.291
CAROLINE: Oh, my God.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.442
This is Josie, in honor of their mother.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.768
This is Elizabeth,
in honor of your mother.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.761
ENZO: Meet Rayna Cruz.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.041
VALERIE:
Once you've been marked by her sword,

00:25.280 --> 00:26.441
she never stops hunting you.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.608
You don't stand a chance against her.
None of us do.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.683
NORA: We'll keep moving.
Just like we did before.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.843
- No!

00:38.440 --> 00:39.680
(GRUNTS)

00:39.960 --> 00:41.041
Stefan.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.161
I'll see you, brother.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.290
I have to keep moving
if I wanna stay ahead of her.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.045
Why did you hand over that sword, Damon?

00:49.280 --> 00:52.648
- I will fix this. I promise you.
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.491
I wish I could be there.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.325
I just wish
it didn't always have to be you.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.641
I love you.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.527
All right, girls, do you know
what this is? It's a bar.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.883
And this is the last time
you're going to be in one of these

01:13.080 --> 01:14.844
until you are 21.

01:15.320 --> 01:19.166
Sorry, we're closed and...
(SIGHS) I don't think so.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.606
CAROLINE: Oh, we're not staying.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.490
We just got here, and then I realized

01:22.680 --> 01:25.081
I didn't actually know where
the person I'm looking for lived.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.046
Klaus Mikaelson?

01:29.720 --> 01:32.007
Honey, I hate to say this,
but you've wasted a trip.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.691
Look, I know that he comes here.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.763
Okay, my name is Caroline Forbes.
He'll know me.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.571
I don't care who you are.
Klaus Mikaelson is gone.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.889
Gone? Gone where?

01:43.120 --> 01:46.044
I mean, nobody's seen or heard
from that man in three years.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.126
STEFAN: South Georgia, I think.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.045
I just ditched my car
and passed Grantville off I-85.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.568
Okay, you're about to come upon
Highway 27. Take it north.

02:00.080 --> 02:03.084
Eventually you'll connect with
the I-20 and want to take that west.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.044
And where is this leading me exactly?

02:05.240 --> 02:07.811
A safe house that's been imbued
with a magical disruption spell.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.883
Even the strongest magic
can't penetrate its walls,

02:10.039 --> 02:13.044
which means Rayna Cruz's sword
cannot track you there.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.406
Did you find 27 yet?

02:14.600 --> 02:17.331
No. I just pulled over at a QuikStop
in the middle of nowhere.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.607
Tell me you're joking.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.928
My cell phone's almost dead.
I need a charger.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.844
Stefan, that's a mistake.
Get back in your car.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.801
Stefan, you can't stop moving, ever.
Stefan. Are you there?

02:28.040 --> 02:29.485
Hello?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.085
Hello?

02:39.880 --> 02:41.723
Hi. I need to buy a charger for my phone.

02:47.440 --> 02:51.161
Okay, we've got the brick charger,
the adapter for your car.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.606
This one's solar power. Pretty neat.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.040
This is fine. How much?

02:54.240 --> 02:55.446
That'll bâ‚¬ $22.50.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.847
Hey!

03:15.080 --> 03:16.127
(TIRES SCREECHING)

03:31.720 --> 03:34.291
Valerie said she just lost
cell reception with Stefan.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.682
As if ruining his life wasn't
enough for me to worry about,

03:37.880 --> 03:40.167
now I get to wonder when
you and Valerie exchanged numbers.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.051
You told Stefan you would find a way
to get him off the hook with Rayna,

03:43.280 --> 03:45.408
and I told Caroline I'd make sure
you didn't screw it up.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.724
So we both have a lot riding on this.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.480
(DOOR CLOSES)

03:53.200 --> 03:56.010
Good. You made it.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.725
DAMON: Where the hell are we?

03:58.960 --> 04:00.485
ENZO: This is the Armory.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.524
Home to a society of
supernatural artifact collectors.

04:03.960 --> 04:07.851
They keep them under lock and key,
so they don't fall into the wrong hands.

04:08.240 --> 04:13.280
The Armory. Never heard of it. You?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.968
- Nope.
- ENZO: Yeah, that's kind of the point.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.685
They've taken great care
to keep themselves

04:17.880 --> 04:19.325
out of history as we know it.

04:19.640 --> 04:24.089
And for three easy payments of $19.99,
we too can be members.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.968
How about we just cut to the part
where they can save my brother.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.361
Where's the cavalry, man?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.324
They're out on their own
supernatural treasure hunt.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.285
But, lucky you, they've recruited me
to nab Rayna Cruz.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.207
Ever since that annoying Phoenix Stone
turned up in Mystic Falls,

04:36.400 --> 04:37.925
she's been their top priority.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.204
They actually consider her one of
the supernatural wonders of the world.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.971
And why do you care what they want?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.043
- They have something I want.
-(DOOR BEEPS)

04:48.800 --> 04:50.131
Good morning.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.322
ENZO: When the Armory kidnapped me
four months ago,

04:52.560 --> 04:55.803
it wasn't to torture me. A woman
named Alex made me an offer.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.447
Who the hell are you?

04:58.280 --> 04:59.691
Someone who needs your help.

05:00.040 --> 05:03.965
And in return can provide you with
information you desperately want.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.366
(CHUCKLES)

05:05.560 --> 05:08.769
If it's all the same, I'd rather just
be cut loose and be on my way.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.086
Be my guest.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.924
Just figured you'd want to know
who your family was. Orphan and all.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.530
How do you know about my family?

05:22.720 --> 05:26.520
Because as obnoxious as it sounds,
we like to think we know everything.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.126
(DOOR BEEPS)

05:28.560 --> 05:31.803
ENZO: Needless to say, I've been
working for the Armory ever since.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.928
Look. All we need to do
is get Stefan here,

05:35.120 --> 05:37.885
and Rayna will have no choice
but to follow, a rat to the cheese.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.241
We spring the trap, and the Armory

05:39.480 --> 05:41.608
keeps her under
lock and key forever after.

05:41.960 --> 05:45.681
Everyone gets on with their lives.
(EXHALES) What do you say?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.402
I'll have to discuss this with my Council.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.609
Okay, we're in.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.042
Must be time for another checkup.
(CHUCKLES)

06:03.480 --> 06:05.881
Actually, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.565
What's going on?

06:07.800 --> 06:10.485
I'm moving to Dallas. I'm leaving today.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.690
What? No, Ric,

06:13.880 --> 06:15.530
you still need a house,

06:15.720 --> 06:17.609
and a nanny,
and the right school district...

06:17.800 --> 06:21.441
I don't care. After I saw their little
faces yesterday, everything changed.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.244
Is this about that psycho huntress?

06:24.480 --> 06:27.689
Because you can rest assured
she is very far away from here,

06:27.880 --> 06:30.360
pursuing my equally
far away from here boyfriend.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.446
No. It's not about her, okay?
It's about Jo.

06:35.640 --> 06:39.042
And the promise I made to her to
leave town after we got married,

06:39.240 --> 06:40.446
and we know how that turned out, okay?

06:40.640 --> 06:43.405
So I'm not making that mistake twice,
and certainly not with my kids.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.127
Well, do you know how hard it is to travel
with one newborn, let alone two?

06:47.320 --> 06:49.971
Two car seats. Two feeding schedules.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.210
Crying in surround sound.
Not to mention the actual driving part.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.880
I know, and stopping every 90 minutes.
I get it.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.287
Which is why I've hired a nurse
to come with me.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.683
A nurse? Who? Frankie
with the heart murmur,

07:02.880 --> 07:05.531
or Jarica the perpetual boyfriend-texter?

07:06.440 --> 07:07.487
Jaflca.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.808
- Come on.
- Do you have a better idea?

07:12.440 --> 07:15.569
Me. I'm the better idea.

07:18.360 --> 07:22.524
But you just got through a major surgery,
you just had a C-section.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.285
And I'm all healed up.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.484
That is the one and only perk
of a vampire pregnancy.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.683
(CHUCKLES)
I can either sit here, alone, freaking out

07:31.880 --> 07:33.848
that my boyfriend is
somewhere in this country

07:34.040 --> 07:36.930
trying to outrun a huntress
who will stop at nothing to kill him,

07:37.320 --> 07:39.891
or I can be useful. It's up to you.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.926
(SCOFFS)

08:00.560 --> 08:01.721
(SIGHING)

08:41.240 --> 08:44.722
Welcome to New Orleans, old friend.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.363
Klaus, as I live and breathe.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.802
Stefan Salvatore in the Crescent City.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.970
This ought to be very good,
or entertainingly bad.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.286
(CHUCKLES)

09:08.520 --> 09:10.727
Well, I'm just in town for a little R&R.

09:12.640 --> 09:13.801
Hate to disappoint.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.490
(STEFAN SIGHS)

09:17.920 --> 09:20.730
So, how are Elijah and, uh,

09:20.920 --> 09:22.604
whoever else you've brought back
from the dead?

09:22.960 --> 09:26.169
Oh, you know the Mikaelsons.
Never a dull moment.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.571
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

09:34.200 --> 09:36.851
So of all the gin joints, you pick ours,

09:37.040 --> 09:41.045
four walls invulnerable to the magic
of those pesky locator spells.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.730
Bit of a coincidence, isn't it?

09:46.320 --> 09:48.322
Damon's looking for me,
and I don't want to be found.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.764
I figure you of all people
can relate to family drama.

09:57.360 --> 10:02.287
Sylvia, this is an old friend,
please keep his cup brimming.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.490
Mmm. Cute old friend.
Where have you been hiding him?

10:05.680 --> 10:07.364
KLAUS: Quaint little place
called Mystic Falls.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.803
Home of the mining fires that prompted
a town-wide evacuation.

10:11.680 --> 10:17.084
It was very noble of you to stand up
for the human faction as you did,

10:17.920 --> 10:20.890
and in such uncharacteristically
sweeping, dramatic fashion.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.646
(CHUCKLES)

10:23.760 --> 10:25.569
I did have some help.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.484
How is Caroline?

10:31.560 --> 10:32.925
(SIGHS)

10:36.520 --> 10:39.763
Sylvia, I think we are going to
need another round.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.529
What do you mean, you don't know
where Rayna is? She's wherever Stefan is.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.881
MATT: No one knows where he is either.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.167
He's not taking anyone's calls.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.368
And I can't triangulate his cell phone
without at least knowing--

10:51.560 --> 10:52.607
- What? Sorry.
-(BABIES WAILING)

10:52.760 --> 10:54.683
lam in a little bell jar of baby noises.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.410
I think they need to eat. Are you hungry?

10:56.600 --> 10:58.762
No. Yes. We should stop.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.969
Caroline? Hello?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.606
I'm here. What's the plan?

11:03.800 --> 11:05.290
If I can narrow the search,
we have a chance.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.643
But until I know the general vicinity of
either of them, I have nothing to track.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.770
I may be able to help you with that.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.286
Let me guess.
Valerie's here to save the day.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.489
Let me call you back.

11:18.520 --> 11:21.046
This is the highway system
between Grantville and New Orleans.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.609
Stefan's on his way there now, and Rayna
is no doubt breathing down his neck.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.569
Tell me you at least appreciate the irony.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.409
I need your help because
there's no sheriff's department left.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.441
The reason there's no sheriff's department
is because you killed all the sheriffs.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.885
Then, yes, I do appreciate the irony.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.403
Just as I hope you appreciate that
I helped Caroline deliver her babies,

11:45.640 --> 11:48.291
and that I am here because
I'm desperate to keep Stefan alive.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.765
(SIGHS)

11:53.160 --> 11:57.006
I suppose if she stole a car or something,
I could get a bead on her.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.211
Thank you.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.607
I thought you hated rubbish food.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.280
I do. Maybe it'll kill me.

12:07.480 --> 12:12.850
Beau, Lily, Oscar, Malcolm, our family
couldn't survive in this new world.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.451
And now, once again, the two of us
have to worry about a psychotic huntress

12:17.640 --> 12:20.120
who will kill any vampire in her sight.

12:20.320 --> 12:24.120
Maybe this will be a quick,
sodium-laden means to my end.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.891
Is this really who I'm stuck
traveling cross-country with?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.809
We're running for our lives.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.365
What could I possibly have
to be happy about?

12:30.600 --> 12:35.527
Us, Mary Lou. Starting over.
Together. Away from all this.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.004
New horizons. New everything. Here.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.725
Am I supposed to know what that is?

12:42.920 --> 12:44.684
It's a ring. Made from candy.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.885
It's not even a diamond,
but what it is, is good enough.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.049
We're all we have left.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.288
Let's see what else is out there together.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.605
(SIGHS) I suppose there's no one I'd
rather explore this dreadful world with.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.247
(GASPS)

13:11.880 --> 13:12.927
(GASPS)

13:15.280 --> 13:16.645
Poor thing.

13:18.320 --> 13:21.005
So desperate to embrace the modern world,

13:21.200 --> 13:23.885
but so unable to grasp
the concept of cell phone tracking.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.844
Bag 'em up and let's go home.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.526
Where's Stefan?

13:28.720 --> 13:31.564
Safe. Though I suppose that could mean
anywhere outside of your vicinity.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.571
You know he has a girlfriend, right?
Blonde? Sweet? Cute as a button?

13:34.760 --> 13:35.886
You're not actually her.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.566
I'm hanging up now.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.047
You don't wanna do that.
I have a way to take down Rayna,

13:40.240 --> 13:41.890
but it requires him to come to me.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.481
Well, that might take a while.
He's in New Orleans.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.809
Doubtful. We only go to New Orleans
for crappy booze and Klaus blood.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.004
There's a bar there,
the St. James Infirmary.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.726
It's considered a safe house
for supernatural travelers.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.287
Oscar came upon it when he was
looking for the Phoenix Stone.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.568
Fine. Tell them to pack it up
and huff it back to Virginia

13:58.760 --> 14:00.410
to a pile of bricks called the Armory.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.931
Did you just say the Armory?

14:02.120 --> 14:05.044
Yes, I did. As a matter of fact
I've said that word more times today

14:05.280 --> 14:06.327
than I have in my entire life.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.682
- Get out of there, Damon. Now.
- Why?

14:08.880 --> 14:11.042
The Armory is a black hole of lies.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.084
They once tricked us into
using Beau as bait,

14:13.280 --> 14:15.328
in exactly the same fashion
they'll use Stefan.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.251
And they were more than happy to
let Rayna bury her sword in his heart,

14:18.440 --> 14:20.090
as long as they could put her
in one of their cages.

14:20.280 --> 14:23.011
I promise you,
they will do the same to Stefan.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.885
Well, I don't have another option
at the moment, Valerie.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.923
Yeah, well, whose fault is that?

14:28.120 --> 14:31.966
Look, the best way you can help Stefan
is to keep your mouth shut

14:32.160 --> 14:33.969
and stop making things worse.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.287
(SIGHS)

14:41.400 --> 14:45.724
So this faceless, so-called Armory
claims to know where you come from.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.682
I find Rayna Cruz,
they fill in the blanks.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.729
And if you have to lie
or hurt your friends

14:50.920 --> 14:54.163
or screw anyone over in the process,
so be it, right?

14:56.120 --> 14:58.646
I was sent to a workhouse
at the age of four

14:58.840 --> 15:02.811
with a concept of family so limited
that I actually convinced myself

15:03.040 --> 15:05.202
that an Italian line cook was my father.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.963
By 14, I was out on the streets.
By 27, I was dead.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.482
That is it. That is the sum total
of my life as a human.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.684
I know how to comfort myself,
live off scraps, and catch disease.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.286
And the rest, you know, love,

15:20.520 --> 15:24.161
relationships, family, these are
things I know nothing about.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.764
This is what the Armory can provide me.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.169
So will I do whatever it takes
for answers? In a heartbeat.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.287
Flag on the play.

15:32.480 --> 15:35.324
Like an idiot, Stefan didn't renew
the minutes on his cell phone.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.686
We'll call you when we connect.
Come on, Bon. I wanna beat traffic.

15:42.840 --> 15:43.966
You know where he is.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.525
Yeah, I do, Enzo.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.890
I also know that you allowed me to believe
Elena was dead so I'd help you kill Rayna,

15:50.080 --> 15:52.162
who has already escaped your custody once.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.283
Then you tricked me into saving your ass,

15:54.480 --> 15:56.482
which resulted in Rayna
getting this stupid sword,

15:56.720 --> 15:59.371
and now I have Stefan's 1863 siphon crush

15:59.600 --> 16:01.807
telling me that you all are shady people.

16:02.360 --> 16:06.604
So Bonbon here and I are gonna go
cook up a Plan B. But thanks anyway--

16:54.920 --> 16:56.922
Poor bloke's been in a coma ever since.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.007
Why the hell is he here?

16:59.240 --> 17:03.131
He's an associate of ours, actually.
We take care of our own.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.284
That's why you have Elena.

17:07.800 --> 17:08.961
Cookie for you.

17:10.119 --> 17:13.442
Well, it turns out Tyler made contact with
the Armory during his hunter sojourns.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.010
So when Matt Donovan needed help
with the vampire problem in Mystic Falls,

17:17.200 --> 17:18.645
he called Tyler,
who then called the Armory,

17:18.839 --> 17:20.410
thinking they'd put me away for good.

17:20.640 --> 17:25.521
Little did he know they wanted me to
work for them instead. So here we all are.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.526
In a cell. That's how
you take care of people?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.211
Now, don't worry about Tyler.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.920
We're simply keeping him alive
until his werewolf transformation

17:35.120 --> 17:39.011
stirs him awake and heals him up.
Shouldn't be long now.

17:49.440 --> 17:50.487

Look, you're welcome to watch the show
with me on this side of the glass.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.487
Just give me Stefan's location.

17:56.720 --> 18:01.044

I'm a sucker for the front row.

We'll see how long that lasts.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.724
-(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- ENZO: Damon put Tyler in a coma.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.488
Bit of a hallucination mix-up that

18:24.680 --> 18:27.331
resulted in Damon
introducing Tyler's skull

18:27.520 --> 18:29.648
to the pavement several times.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.361
If the Armory hadn't found him,
he'd be a vegetable.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.881
Or dead. Ice?

18:36.680 --> 18:40.480
You knock me out, then offer me ice?
What is wrong with you?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.047
Where is Damon?

18:43.240 --> 18:45.686
I locked him in a room
with Tyler on a full moon.

she gave birth to them,

on the steps of St. Ann's Church.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.409
She will pursue you until your paranoia

your desire to live.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.487

she will find you.

We have a chest that was

they're Ric's...

27:43.240 --> 27:46.449
Yes, that's been made abundantly clear
to me by your boyfriend.

in the face of my misery

28:01.960 --> 28:03.564

28:03.760 --> 28:05.125
Stefan will be fine.

Luckily, these aren't mine.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.525
So you've mentioned.

28:36.480 --> 28:40.007
You know, my family challenges
the bounds of my sanity,
