02:13.574 --> 02:14.406
Come on!

02:19.412 --> 02:20.447
Idiots.

02:49.944 --> 02:52.613
And step all through.

02:55.182 --> 02:56.483
There you go.

03:05.058 --> 03:05.993
Good catch.

03:17.237 --> 03:18.103
Did you get it?

03:18.105 --> 03:18.973
Yeah.

03:20.173 --> 03:22.241
Woody, that's
not the right one!

03:22.243 --> 03:23.574
Oh, did you mean this one?

03:23.576 --> 03:24.610
This one?

03:24.612 --> 03:25.477
Not funny.

03:25.479 --> 03:26.780
Go put this on, go.

03:28.214 --> 03:29.750
Stop peeking, Woody!

03:37.925 --> 03:39.826
Any last piece of advice, Dad?

03:40.962 --> 03:43.731
The way I see it, you
got a couple choices here.

03:51.438 --> 03:55.140
Who gives this woman to
be joined in holy matrimony?

03:55.142 --> 03:56.144
Her mother and I.

04:11.658 --> 04:12.860
You can be seated.

04:15.695 --> 04:17.696
No, no, I'm good, baby.

04:17.697 --> 04:19.100
No, it's on, yeah.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.567
Congratulations, Woody.

04:21.569 --> 04:23.535
Old boy's supposed to pay
me Friday but he jagged me.

04:23.537 --> 04:25.903
I got the Benjis
now, so it's on.

04:25.905 --> 04:26.672
Hey.

04:26.674 --> 04:28.307
Good luck, man.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.875
I get paid, I buy from
you, know what I'm saying?

04:30.877 --> 04:31.643
Right?

04:31.645 --> 04:32.713
Are we good?

04:34.213 --> 04:35.547
Yeah.

04:36.417 --> 04:37.548
Tonight?

04:37.550 --> 04:40.518
The Thrifty, 27th and 2nd.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.856
I'll be there, baby.

04:43.590 --> 04:47.026
Case 714, December
13th, 6:37 p.m.

04:47.028 --> 04:50.194
Detective Woods in combo
with suspect Cindy Jones,

04:50.196 --> 04:51.997
arranging buy meeting.

04:53.134 --> 04:54.600
Here's Cindy.

04:54.602 --> 04:56.535
Pretty nice ride
for a girl from the hood.

04:56.537 --> 04:59.437
Man, I can't believe she fell
for your Jello pudding jive.

04:59.439 --> 05:00.504
I learned
it all from you.

05:00.506 --> 05:01.305
That's what I do.

05:01.307 --> 05:02.206
I do it all day.

05:03.610 --> 05:04.543
All right, man, you ready?

05:04.545 --> 05:05.410
Yeah.

05:05.412 --> 05:06.411
Testing, testing.

05:06.413 --> 05:07.780
It's good.

05:07.782 --> 05:09.014
So remember, you're
gonna keep her in view

05:09.016 --> 05:10.749
the whole time,
make sure you stay...

05:10.751 --> 05:12.850
Hey, it's not my
first rodeo, Sherlock.

05:12.852 --> 05:14.418
Check you out, mixed metaphor.

05:14.420 --> 05:15.887
- Here we go.
- Go.

05:29.869 --> 05:31.706
All right, man, there's Cindy.

05:33.439 --> 05:34.274
Got her.

05:37.076 --> 05:38.742
Looks like she can
stick that whole pharmacy

05:38.744 --> 05:39.980
in that big old coat.

05:43.083 --> 05:45.016
It looks like she's
packing up, buddy.

05:45.018 --> 05:47.588
All right, man, here
we go, here we go.

05:53.860 --> 05:55.759
Cindy Jones, Philadelphia PD.

05:55.761 --> 05:57.362
Oh shit, you
gotta be kidding me!

05:57.364 --> 05:58.329
Now, now, kitty, be nice.

05:58.331 --> 05:59.663
How you doing, Cindy?

05:59.665 --> 06:01.033
Baby?

06:01.035 --> 06:02.533
It's nice to finally
meet you face to face.

06:02.535 --> 06:04.168
That was you?

06:04.170 --> 06:05.704
Yeah.

06:05.706 --> 06:07.538
Okay, so the way I see it,
you got a couple choices here.

06:07.540 --> 06:09.141
All right, you can give
us the name of the doctor

06:09.143 --> 06:10.408
who wrote the scripts

06:10.410 --> 06:12.543
or we can ruin your night.

06:16.984 --> 06:17.983
Hey!

06:17.985 --> 06:18.649
FBI!

06:18.651 --> 06:19.584
DEA.

06:19.586 --> 06:20.952
Philadelphia PD.

06:20.954 --> 06:22.553
This is a local bust.

06:22.555 --> 06:24.256
Don't worry your pretty
little head about it.

06:24.258 --> 06:25.023
No, no, no, no.

06:25.025 --> 06:26.458
We built this collar.

06:26.460 --> 06:27.959
Ooh, looks like a
formal investigation.

06:27.961 --> 06:29.326
You going to the prom?

06:30.965 --> 06:33.298
This is an interstate
drug situation, my friend.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.966
You are in second place.

06:34.968 --> 06:36.468
No, no, if she
doesn't give us what we need,

06:36.470 --> 06:37.735
she's going to city jail.

06:37.737 --> 06:38.535
She's a federal suspect!

06:38.537 --> 06:39.704
Dr. Gosnell!

06:42.542 --> 06:46.646
The woman I get the scripts
from works for Dr. Gosnell.

06:51.319 --> 06:54.685
I promise I'm only doing
drugs a few more months.

06:54.687 --> 06:56.788
Oh, I've heard that before.

06:56.790 --> 06:58.156
You'll start with the drugs

06:58.158 --> 07:00.024
and then you'll
go back to murder.

07:00.026 --> 07:01.959
I'm sick of looking at
autopsies and murder weapons.

07:01.961 --> 07:03.495
I just want a normal life.

07:03.497 --> 07:04.963
Take the job at the
governor's office.

07:04.965 --> 07:06.430
We'll move to Harrisburg.

07:06.432 --> 07:08.632
If we move, can we get a dog?

07:08.634 --> 07:09.901
If we have a bigger yard

07:09.903 --> 07:11.002
and someone does the
dishes, we might.

07:11.004 --> 07:12.737
It's not my turn, it's his.

07:12.739 --> 07:13.738
And a hot tub.

07:13.740 --> 07:14.572
Mmm.

07:15.441 --> 07:16.507
- Ew!
- Mom!

07:16.509 --> 07:17.809
Oh, I gotta take this.

07:17.811 --> 07:18.877
I gotta go.

07:18.879 --> 07:20.213
Just take him for one second.

07:20.913 --> 07:22.115
You're not done yet.

07:23.216 --> 07:25.249
Woody, I'm not
back 'til tomorrow.

07:25.251 --> 07:27.685
There's that
voice I long to hear!

07:27.687 --> 07:28.586
Thought you were back today.

07:28.588 --> 07:29.788
I'll call Dan.

07:29.790 --> 07:31.456
Well, now I'm
curious, what's up?

07:31.458 --> 07:32.689
Well, we found our Oxy source.

07:32.691 --> 07:35.259
It's a Dr. Kermit Gosnell.

07:35.261 --> 07:39.264
He runs a clinic at
3801 Lancaster Avenue.

07:39.266 --> 07:40.598
Wanted to get a
warrant so we can take

07:40.600 --> 07:41.966
a hidden camera in there.

07:41.968 --> 07:43.735
I'll follow up
with Dan tomorrow.

07:43.737 --> 07:47.074
I'm always happy to help you
with these drug cases, Woody.

07:48.609 --> 07:49.708
Bye, kids!

07:49.710 --> 07:51.108
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

07:51.110 --> 07:52.712
Okay, go
get your backpack.

07:54.913 --> 07:56.113
Is Mom the police?

07:56.115 --> 07:59.117
No, Mom's the
boss of the police.

07:59.119 --> 08:00.584
And don't you forget it.

08:21.275 --> 08:22.406
Now, don't
you speak all that

08:22.408 --> 08:23.608
in one place either.

08:23.610 --> 08:25.276
What have we got?

08:25.278 --> 08:26.610
We have surveillance
footage from Gosnell's clinic.

08:26.612 --> 08:28.747
All in one place, do you?

08:28.749 --> 08:31.986
This
ain't my rookie season, okay?

08:33.020 --> 08:33.951
I hear ya.

08:33.953 --> 08:35.155
Money changing hands.

08:37.722 --> 08:38.823
You got jokes.

08:38.825 --> 08:39.890
I'll try to make...

08:39.892 --> 08:41.225
Okay, let's pick her up.

08:42.794 --> 08:45.629
That never
went so fast in my life.

08:45.631 --> 08:48.966
I got there at quarter to,
that's before my.

08:48.968 --> 08:50.768
Hey, hey, beautiful.

08:50.770 --> 08:51.668
You going for a ride today.

08:51.670 --> 08:52.870
Hold up!

08:52.872 --> 08:54.272
You a cop?

08:54.274 --> 08:56.140
Yes, ma'am, I am
a police officer.

08:56.142 --> 08:57.808
Man, this is
some entrapment bullshit.

08:57.810 --> 08:59.076
You poor thing, I
feel so sorry for you.

08:59.078 --> 09:00.845
Please watch your head.

09:00.847 --> 09:03.315
Keshawna, the way I see it,
you got a couple choices here.

09:03.317 --> 09:07.951
Look, most of the pharmacists,
you know, they legit.

09:07.953 --> 09:09.120
You can't be going in
with the same names

09:09.122 --> 09:10.790
on the script all the time.

09:11.726 --> 09:13.725
So, Doc Gosnell, he
has us pay junkies

09:13.727 --> 09:16.861
50 bucks for their IDs and
writes the scripts for 'em.

09:16.863 --> 09:18.764
Is he the only
one writing scripts?

09:18.766 --> 09:20.499
He the
only doctor there.

09:20.501 --> 09:21.932
They got girls that
been to high school

09:21.934 --> 09:23.033
doing the procedures.

09:23.035 --> 09:24.602
Procedures?

09:24.604 --> 09:25.971
Yeah, the abortions.

09:25.973 --> 09:27.572
So you
send in the Smurfs.

09:27.574 --> 09:28.740
That's right.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.708
Seekers pay 84 and 80.

09:30.710 --> 09:33.610
That mean $3200 for a script.

09:33.612 --> 09:34.712
Seekers?

09:34.714 --> 09:36.750
Yeah, see, we got three...

09:39.819 --> 09:41.820
He got three kind of
customers at the clinic.

09:41.822 --> 09:45.789
The seekers, they the ones
come in for the drugs.

09:45.791 --> 09:48.625
Oxy, sometimes Xanax, Percocet.

09:48.627 --> 09:50.995
And you got the procedures,

09:50.997 --> 09:52.697
and they gotta
get they pain meds

09:52.699 --> 09:55.133
to get ready for the abortions
when the doctor comes in.

09:55.135 --> 09:56.634
'Cause see, he don't
even get there most days

09:56.636 --> 09:58.669
'til like 7:00 at night or so.

09:58.671 --> 10:01.807
So you use the
Smurfs to get the IDs

10:01.809 --> 10:02.974
for the scripts, right?

10:02.976 --> 10:04.643
And then the seekers...

10:04.645 --> 10:06.845
Wait, who's giving the
abortion patients their meds?

10:06.847 --> 10:08.212
What's that got
to do with anything?

10:08.214 --> 10:09.279
Well, if there's
no doctor there,

10:09.281 --> 10:10.514
who's doling out the pain meds?

10:10.516 --> 10:11.615
Any of us.

10:11.617 --> 10:15.419
Alison, Lydia, Betty, sometimes.

10:15.421 --> 10:16.354
Excuse me.

10:16.356 --> 10:17.688
Can we finish the conversation

10:17.690 --> 10:19.289
about the narcotics operation?

10:19.291 --> 10:20.792
And Lydia was there
when that one woman died.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.163
Wait, a woman died?

10:28.702 --> 10:30.235
This doesn't make
sense to me here.

10:30.237 --> 10:31.769
Healthy woman goes
into a clinic,

10:31.771 --> 10:33.770
comes out dead and
there's no police report?

10:33.772 --> 10:35.139
How does that that happen?

10:35.141 --> 10:36.674
I thought you were
working narcotics.

10:36.676 --> 10:38.176
Woody, you back at homicide?

10:38.178 --> 10:40.010
Can't a
guy have hobbies.

10:40.012 --> 10:42.447
The death certificate
said accidental death.

10:42.449 --> 10:44.048
Fentanyl and
Demerol don't sound

10:44.050 --> 10:45.149
like accidental drugs to me.

10:45.151 --> 10:46.918
They sound like doctor drugs.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.519
Yeah, fine, but if a
doctor administered 'em,

10:48.521 --> 10:50.754
it's not a crime,
it's an accident.

10:50.756 --> 10:52.322
Malpractice, maybe.

10:52.324 --> 10:55.228
What if the doctor
didn't administer those?

10:58.665 --> 11:00.032
What do the Feds say?

11:00.034 --> 11:00.965
They're saying
it's a drug case.

11:00.967 --> 11:02.533
It is a drug case.

11:02.535 --> 11:04.369
Woman goes into a clinic,
gets drugged to death

11:04.371 --> 11:06.471
by some untrained teen and
that's just a drug case?

11:06.473 --> 11:08.005
That's a lot of
assumptions, Woody.

11:08.007 --> 11:09.474
We don't know that
any of that's true.

11:09.476 --> 11:10.942
Karnamaya Mongar, okay.

11:10.944 --> 11:12.644
41 years old.

11:12.646 --> 11:14.745
Her husband and her and her
kid get chased out of Bhutan

11:14.747 --> 11:17.249
for some ethnic cleansing
bullshit, I don't know what it is.

11:17.251 --> 11:20.217
They spend 20 years in a
straw hut in a refugee camp

11:20.219 --> 11:22.620
in Nepal, only to
finally, finally make it

11:22.622 --> 11:24.589
to the good ol' USA.

11:24.591 --> 11:27.759
Four months later, she goes in
for a procedure with Dr. Oxy.

11:27.761 --> 11:30.827
Now she's dead and no
one seems to give a damn?

11:30.829 --> 11:31.796
You seem to give a damn.

11:31.798 --> 11:33.432
I do.

11:33.434 --> 11:34.966
Okay, all right, what
kind of procedure was it?

11:34.968 --> 11:36.035
Abortion.

11:39.405 --> 11:40.274
What?

11:41.974 --> 11:43.808
I thought you were pro-choice.

11:43.810 --> 11:45.442
What does that have
to do with anything?

11:45.444 --> 11:46.711
I don't know, what
does that have to do

11:46.713 --> 11:47.846
with anything, Dan?

11:47.848 --> 11:49.349
It complicates things.

11:51.718 --> 11:52.650
Am I in the right place here?

11:52.652 --> 11:53.850
This is homicide, right?

11:53.852 --> 11:54.985
Homicide?

11:54.987 --> 11:58.092
Because this is homicide, Dan.

11:59.692 --> 12:00.628
It's homicide.

12:04.164 --> 12:05.429
Is she your girlfriend?

12:05.431 --> 12:07.265
- Exactly.
- Thank you, Dad.

12:07.267 --> 12:08.231
Thank, Buddy, thank
you for being an adult.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.033
Cannot deny.

12:10.971 --> 12:12.703
Is that the police?

12:12.705 --> 12:14.038
I'll just be a minute.

12:14.040 --> 12:14.972
They're
coming to get you.

12:14.974 --> 12:16.039
Let's hope so.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.374
Woody, it's dinner time.

12:17.376 --> 12:18.576
Why didn't
you back me up in there?

12:18.578 --> 12:20.012
Woody.

12:20.014 --> 12:21.947
That poor woman lost her
life because some moron

12:21.949 --> 12:23.480
pumped her full of drugs and
you're just gonna ignore it?

12:24.516 --> 12:25.749
Woody, you
got your warrant.

12:25.751 --> 12:26.684
What?

12:26.686 --> 12:28.286
You got your warrant.

12:28.288 --> 12:31.755
You're going with the FBI, stay
out of their way, all right?

12:31.757 --> 12:32.758
Okay, yeah.

12:33.859 --> 12:36.228
Now, is there anything
else you'd like to say to me?

12:37.296 --> 12:40.264
You like the Eagles or
the Giants with spread?

12:47.973 --> 12:50.009
Okay, guys, we're set.

12:52.011 --> 12:53.879
Yo, who's Nurse
Ratchet over there?

12:53.881 --> 12:55.312
Mmm, Department of Health.

12:55.314 --> 12:56.413
She's gotta be there
because the clinic's

12:56.415 --> 12:58.515
gonna be open when we go in.

12:58.517 --> 12:59.386
Mmm hmm.

13:03.055 --> 13:04.822
Good slice?

13:04.824 --> 13:06.523
No?

13:06.525 --> 13:08.493
You know you guys got this
warrant in the Mongar case.

13:08.495 --> 13:10.894
Look for what you need, don't
screw up our evidence, got it?

13:10.896 --> 13:11.732
Got it.

13:12.899 --> 13:14.197
All right, listen up.

13:15.769 --> 13:17.534
We move through the
clinic fast, get everyone

13:17.536 --> 13:19.604
in separate rooms so
they can't compare notes.

13:19.606 --> 13:21.806
We're not expecting any
weapons, but you never know,

13:21.808 --> 13:23.508
so be prepared.

13:23.510 --> 13:26.244
This is Nurse Sandra Rose,
Department of Health.

13:26.246 --> 13:28.145
She's coming along to
ensure the well-being

13:28.147 --> 13:30.216
of any patients we
might encounter.

13:31.484 --> 13:34.418
We are looking for
scripts, pills,

13:34.420 --> 13:37.422
anything that looks like
drugs or paraphernalia.

13:37.424 --> 13:39.756
Don't touch anything else.

13:39.758 --> 13:43.062
They'll have copies of the
warrant, know why we're here.

13:43.729 --> 13:44.598
Let's move.

13:53.506 --> 13:56.642
Officer,
what's going on?

14:02.649 --> 14:03.780
Good evening.

14:03.782 --> 14:06.486
We have a warrant to
search the premises.

14:09.122 --> 14:10.721
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:10.723 --> 14:12.155
- We need to talk to you!
- Lets spread out.

14:12.157 --> 14:13.924
- Stop, stop!
- Got your instructions.

14:14.928 --> 14:16.360
Roger that.

14:16.362 --> 14:17.394
Gentlemen, do not
disturb the patients.

14:17.396 --> 14:18.763
You take the upstairs.

14:18.765 --> 14:19.630
Yes sir.

14:19.632 --> 14:20.565
All right, come on.

14:41.087 --> 14:43.020
Hey, let's get
that nurse in here!

14:50.463 --> 14:51.863
Who's out there?

14:51.865 --> 14:53.400
No, no.

14:56.136 --> 14:57.804
What is that smell?

15:00.973 --> 15:03.809
Yeah, we're gonna
need more guys up here.

15:04.710 --> 15:06.110
Man, it smells like
a dead fish up in here.

15:06.112 --> 15:07.180
Yeah.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.279
You write these down.

15:12.184 --> 15:14.784
The police, okay,
just stay where you are.

15:14.786 --> 15:17.391
Hey, let's get these
girls in separate rooms!

15:18.324 --> 15:19.890
You two, come with me.

15:21.126 --> 15:22.192
You want me
to hold 'em here?

15:22.194 --> 15:24.131
Keep 'em separate, whew.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.664
Hey, Ken.

15:27.666 --> 15:31.469
I got it, I got it.

15:31.471 --> 15:33.403
Man, I think I
stepped in something.

15:33.405 --> 15:35.139
It's probably cat shit.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.310
Oh man, it is cat shit!

15:38.544 --> 15:39.847
That over there.

15:42.781 --> 15:43.648
Oh my God.

15:43.650 --> 15:44.916
Don't touch that.

15:44.918 --> 15:45.982
What is this, the lunch room?

15:45.984 --> 15:47.217
Lunch room?

15:47.219 --> 15:49.822
No, I'm good, no lunch for me.

16:07.406 --> 16:08.639
Keep those
ladies in the back.

16:08.641 --> 16:11.477
We'll interview 'em
later, all right?

16:13.846 --> 16:15.379
I think I
got some blood spatter

16:15.381 --> 16:16.413
over here or something.

16:16.415 --> 16:17.483
Hey, uh, Woody.

16:18.418 --> 16:19.920
Hey man, you gotta see this.

16:30.329 --> 16:31.995
Hold it up, little higher.

16:46.145 --> 16:48.515
Hey man, is this normal?

16:49.415 --> 16:50.514
I don't know, I've never been

16:50.516 --> 16:51.951
in an abortion clinic before.

16:54.887 --> 16:56.019
You all right?

16:56.021 --> 16:57.855
We've
got eyes on Gosnell.

16:57.857 --> 16:59.155
He's coming in the
north entrance.

16:59.157 --> 17:00.426
Roger that.

17:02.761 --> 17:04.961
Should
be there in a minute.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.108
Hello, hello!

17:19.111 --> 17:20.813
How y'all doing this evening?

17:22.948 --> 17:23.816
Dr. Gosnell.

17:24.916 --> 17:29.386
We are the DEA, the FBI,
and the Philadelphia Police.

17:29.388 --> 17:31.588
Well, goodness, my goodness.

17:31.590 --> 17:33.223
Did we have a break in?

17:33.225 --> 17:36.795
No sir, we have a warrant
to search these premises.

17:37.495 --> 17:39.196
Am I under arrest?

17:39.198 --> 17:40.666
Not at this juncture.

17:42.069 --> 17:44.234
Well, just give me a moment

17:44.236 --> 17:46.903
if you would to put these down.

17:46.905 --> 17:48.308
Ah, thank you.

17:51.844 --> 17:55.014
I have some special patients
I have to attend to.

17:55.915 --> 17:57.984
You gentlemen can come
watch if you like.

18:02.621 --> 18:04.824
Ooh, just a minute, guys.

18:09.628 --> 18:11.362
Ah, there you are.

18:11.364 --> 18:12.699
Hey, hey, hey!

18:13.767 --> 18:16.232
Oh yes, you're
hungry, aren't you?

18:16.234 --> 18:17.169
Here we go.

18:18.338 --> 18:21.972
Ah, come get it, come get
it, come on, come get it.

18:21.974 --> 18:23.708
Come, there you come.

18:23.710 --> 18:24.578
Oh yeah.

18:25.944 --> 18:26.812
Ah, yes.

18:27.981 --> 18:28.882
Ah, yes.

18:30.916 --> 18:35.619
They bring my patients such
joy at a very difficult time.

18:35.621 --> 18:38.321
Doctor, we have a
patient in distress.

18:38.323 --> 18:39.725
Oh, oh dear!

18:40.761 --> 18:43.829
Pardon me, I have to see
about this right away.

19:24.570 --> 19:28.839
I'm hoping
they arrested somebody.

19:28.841 --> 19:31.711
Excuse me, officer, have
there been any arrests?

19:34.880 --> 19:36.146
Can you tell me why the police

19:36.148 --> 19:37.783
are raiding an abortion clinic?

19:40.485 --> 19:42.755
Why are the DEA and
the FBI involved?

19:44.624 --> 19:46.723
What's the matter, you
don't like tattoos?

19:52.933 --> 19:55.633
We're gonna,
scripts, on the fraud,

19:55.635 --> 19:57.469
- on the false IDs.
- Let's go after the money.

19:57.471 --> 19:59.068
You build the money
on top of my case.

19:59.070 --> 20:00.671
Hey, are you just
gonna let him run around

20:00.673 --> 20:01.972
and treat these women?

20:01.974 --> 20:03.641
You know how to do it?

20:03.643 --> 20:05.476
Well, call in an
ambulance or something,

20:05.478 --> 20:06.778
this place is crazy!

20:06.780 --> 20:09.681
Look, that's not
what we're here for.

20:09.683 --> 20:12.215
I'm sorry for
all the extra mess.

20:13.819 --> 20:15.655
You might have noticed, um,

20:20.358 --> 20:21.726
we've been having a dispute

20:21.728 --> 20:26.600
with our medical
disposal company.

20:34.005 --> 20:37.076
Yeah, you see that
little rascal over there?

20:38.511 --> 20:42.148
He's killed over 100
mice in this clinic.

20:55.126 --> 20:56.527
Woody?

20:56.529 --> 20:58.131
You are not gonna believe
what I saw last night.

21:02.335 --> 21:04.568
The stench was unbelievable.

21:04.570 --> 21:05.702
Is this the lunch room?

21:05.704 --> 21:07.938
He had all these
bags everywhere.

21:07.940 --> 21:09.472
He said they were medical waste.

21:09.474 --> 21:10.941
We opened up some of them,

21:10.943 --> 21:14.211
there were little bodies inside.

21:14.213 --> 21:15.278
Bodies?

21:15.280 --> 21:16.413
What do you mean, fetuses?

21:16.415 --> 21:18.952
They looked like babies to me.

21:20.319 --> 21:21.685
How many?

21:21.687 --> 21:23.354
So far, we found
over 30 of them.

21:23.356 --> 21:26.656
Stuffed inside jugs, inside
bags, in the refrigerator,

21:26.658 --> 21:28.291
the freezer, everywhere.

21:28.293 --> 21:30.661
Oh, oh, the jars.

21:30.663 --> 21:34.131
This guy put baby's
feet in jars.

21:35.601 --> 21:37.134
What, what do
you mean, in jars?

21:37.136 --> 21:39.503
No, wait, look,
right over here.

21:39.505 --> 21:40.570
Look at that.

21:40.572 --> 21:41.941
I mean, is that normal?

21:48.580 --> 21:50.183
He had dozens of 'em.

21:51.850 --> 21:54.218
And then they let him
go work on this woman

21:54.220 --> 21:55.619
while we were there.

21:55.621 --> 21:56.988
I'm telling you,
this woman was bigger

21:56.990 --> 21:58.388
than Joan was when
she had Charlie.

21:58.390 --> 22:00.626
And, that's got to
be illegal, right?

22:01.726 --> 22:02.792
I don't know.

22:02.794 --> 22:04.295
A woman that big?

22:04.297 --> 22:05.863
I mean, there has to
be some kind of a limit

22:05.865 --> 22:07.131
on when you can
have an abortion.

22:07.133 --> 22:09.666
Yeah, but I don't
know what that is.

22:09.668 --> 22:11.535
I thought you were a lawyer?

22:11.537 --> 22:13.069
Woody, I have five kids.

22:13.071 --> 22:14.808
What do I know about abortion?

22:17.309 --> 22:18.675
Here.

22:18.677 --> 22:21.010
No person shall perform
or induce an abortion

22:21.012 --> 22:23.079
upon another person
when the gestational age

22:23.081 --> 22:26.085
of the unborn child
is 24 or more weeks.

22:26.953 --> 22:28.618
That's six months.

22:28.620 --> 22:29.487
Unreal.

22:29.489 --> 22:30.557
Six months?

22:33.425 --> 22:36.626
How big is a baby at six months?

22:36.628 --> 22:37.929
Pretty big.

22:37.931 --> 22:39.762
Big enough that the
fetuses that you saw

22:39.764 --> 22:41.031
could have been perfectly legal.

22:41.033 --> 22:44.067
There's something
bad going on there.

22:44.069 --> 22:44.937
I know it.

22:45.672 --> 22:46.770
You got any witnesses?

22:46.772 --> 22:48.207
I got a list of employees.

22:49.541 --> 22:50.876
Let's go talk to 'em.

22:51.777 --> 22:53.144
I made me a color
chart to remember

22:53.146 --> 22:56.446
the different drugs and
how much to give them.

22:56.448 --> 22:58.715
They would tell me a color
and I'd know what to do.

22:58.717 --> 23:01.751
So, Gosnell trained
you to give anesthesia?

23:01.753 --> 23:03.721
How much training did you get?

23:03.723 --> 23:04.957
About 20 minutes.

23:07.292 --> 23:09.593
When did you start
working at the clinic?

23:09.595 --> 23:10.928
'Bout five years ago, I guess.

23:10.930 --> 23:12.699
When you were 15.

23:13.598 --> 23:14.999
Mama worked there.

23:15.001 --> 23:17.000
She'd bring me in after
school for extra credit

23:17.002 --> 23:19.436
and Doc liked me,
so he hired me.

23:19.438 --> 23:21.338
And you would use this
chart to help you know

23:21.340 --> 23:24.442
what drugs to give the women
who came into the clinic?

23:24.444 --> 23:25.542
Yeah.

23:25.544 --> 23:27.045
The Demerol and the Cytotec.

23:27.946 --> 23:30.050
That's the one that
makes them precipitate.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.651
Precipitate?

23:33.653 --> 23:36.623
That's Doc's word for
when the babies come out.

23:38.590 --> 23:40.325
When the babies come out?

23:41.461 --> 23:44.329
What would happen then,
after the babies came out?

23:45.098 --> 23:46.800
Doc or somebody'd snip it?

23:48.533 --> 23:50.268
Snip it?

23:50.270 --> 23:53.004
He would take scissors and
cut the back of their necks.

23:53.739 --> 23:55.071
He taught everybody how to do it

23:55.073 --> 23:57.407
so that it could be
done if he wasn't there.

23:57.409 --> 24:01.780
He did it to all of them, even
the ones that wasn't moving.

24:03.147 --> 24:05.251
Some of the
babies were moving?

24:10.021 --> 24:12.626
Betty, how many times
did you see that happen?

24:13.358 --> 24:14.226
Babies moving?

24:20.398 --> 24:21.800
I don't know.

24:26.271 --> 24:28.407
Got any plans for
the next few years?

24:30.809 --> 24:34.178
Can you just call DA McGuire
and ask if she'll see me?

24:34.180 --> 24:35.311
I mean...

24:35.313 --> 24:36.846
I really
can't, ma'am, I'm sorry.

24:36.848 --> 24:38.015
I mean, I know I don't
have an appointment,

24:38.017 --> 24:38.882
but since I'm
already down here...

24:38.884 --> 24:40.183
I know.

24:40.185 --> 24:41.952
You really need to
have an appointment.

24:41.954 --> 24:43.320
I even know the extension
if you can just like

24:43.322 --> 24:44.954
like 432, like hello,
can DA McGuire see me?

24:44.956 --> 24:46.691
Hey Woody.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.592
Oh, Detective Woods, hi, can
I talk to you for a second?

24:48.594 --> 24:49.961
Do I know you?

24:49.963 --> 24:51.394
Mollie Mullaney,
Mullaney Report.

24:51.396 --> 24:52.963
I just had a couple
questions about the...

24:52.965 --> 24:54.565
The press, no,
I hate the press.

24:54.567 --> 24:55.833
It's nothing personal,
it's just because you guys

24:55.835 --> 24:56.900
lie all the time and stuff.

24:56.902 --> 24:58.001
I'm not from the press.

24:58.003 --> 24:59.036
I'm an investigative blogger.

24:59.038 --> 24:59.903
I just want a few...

24:59.905 --> 25:01.538
Blogger?

25:01.540 --> 25:03.507
Forget it, kid, I don't
even talk to real reporters.

25:03.509 --> 25:05.909
Ah, no bloggers allowed.

25:29.734 --> 25:31.102
Yeah.

25:31.104 --> 25:32.635
That's jammed up
pretty good, huh?

25:32.637 --> 25:34.273
Let's take the whole unit.

25:35.540 --> 25:36.907
Detective Stark?

25:36.909 --> 25:38.075
There are a bunch of
file boxes on the list

25:38.077 --> 25:39.410
that seem to have been moved.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.277
We can't find 'em.

25:40.279 --> 25:41.181
Show me.

25:49.355 --> 25:50.988
It was a cat, there
were cats everywhere

25:50.990 --> 25:52.623
in the whole place,
cat's running around.

25:52.625 --> 25:53.957
And we've been clearing
stuff out of this clinic

25:53.959 --> 25:55.459
for almost 24 hours.

25:55.461 --> 25:57.094
We found envelopes
with cash in 'em

25:57.096 --> 25:59.096
and one of which was
labeled with, uh...

25:59.098 --> 26:00.564
Karnamaya Mongar.

26:00.566 --> 26:01.665
Thank you.

26:01.667 --> 26:03.267
She paid for her own death.

26:03.269 --> 26:05.836
We also found these
plastic medical waste bags.

26:05.838 --> 26:07.471
Some of them contained fetuses.

26:07.473 --> 26:09.440
And then we have these
files that Gosnell

26:09.442 --> 26:12.009
kept on 'em and some of them
corresponded with the fetuses.

26:12.011 --> 26:14.144
How did you match the
files to the bodies?

26:14.146 --> 26:15.746
He labeled them.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.315
He wrote names on a little
piece of masking tape.

26:17.317 --> 26:19.583
The guy must not think
he did anything wrong.

26:19.585 --> 26:22.786
But he was moving the files
and he was moving the bags

26:22.788 --> 26:23.988
in the meantime.

26:23.990 --> 26:25.189
Well, how could he do that?

26:25.191 --> 26:26.623
There were cops
all over the place.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.057
I mean, that's like
a maze up in there.

26:28.059 --> 26:29.292
It's like three houses connected

26:29.294 --> 26:30.728
by secret corridors and stuff.

26:30.730 --> 26:32.496
I got lost in there
a couple times.

26:32.498 --> 26:35.799
But he's not under arrest, so
he could have moved that stuff

26:35.801 --> 26:37.401
at any time under our noses.

26:37.403 --> 26:39.803
I guess he does think
he's doing something wrong.

26:39.805 --> 26:43.073
Yeah, but the question is,
where's he moving the stuff to?

26:48.946 --> 26:50.513
McGuire!

26:50.515 --> 26:52.017
Didn't know you were
gonna party with us today.

26:53.219 --> 26:56.255
Well, I can't let
you boys have all the fun.

26:56.989 --> 26:58.422
You look good in Kevlar.

26:58.424 --> 27:00.093
You should wear it more often.

27:18.578 --> 27:19.776
Dr. Gosnell?

27:19.778 --> 27:20.876
Police, open up.

27:20.878 --> 27:22.415
We've got a search warrant.

27:25.850 --> 27:29.254
Dr. Gosnell, it's the police
with a search warrant, open up.

27:30.655 --> 27:31.558
All right.

27:32.892 --> 27:33.960
Wait!

27:35.627 --> 27:38.596
Rule number one in
a door breach, try the handle.

27:38.598 --> 27:39.598
Thank you.

27:41.232 --> 27:44.101
Dr. Gosnell, Philadelphia
Police Department.

27:44.103 --> 27:46.069
We have a search
warrant for this house.

27:47.906 --> 27:48.974
Dr. Gosnell?

27:50.542 --> 27:51.444
Police.

28:18.870 --> 28:19.938
Dr. Gosnell?

28:21.072 --> 28:22.207
Police Department.

28:24.510 --> 28:27.180
I guess their
cleaning lady took a week off.

28:33.018 --> 28:33.884
Sorry to bother you.

28:33.886 --> 28:35.618
Police.

28:35.620 --> 28:36.955
Is your father at home?

29:06.217 --> 29:08.417
Dr. Gosnell, Philadelphia
Police Department.

29:08.419 --> 29:10.588
We have a search warrant
for your house, sir.

29:11.557 --> 29:14.226
Of
course, of course.

29:15.394 --> 29:18.263
Just let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

29:19.164 --> 29:21.631
I assume you've met my daughter.

29:21.633 --> 29:22.669
Is your wife here?

29:23.769 --> 29:24.867
No, she's not.

29:24.869 --> 29:25.804
She's shopping.

29:26.772 --> 29:28.440
Make yourselves at
home.

29:47.059 --> 29:49.159
Deeds to houses.

29:49.161 --> 29:51.397
He's got real estate
all over the place.

29:52.431 --> 29:54.731
That's not all he's got.

29:54.733 --> 29:56.034
Look at this.

30:12.484 --> 30:15.719
May I fix you
some breakfast, detective?

30:15.721 --> 30:16.588
No thank you.

30:18.457 --> 30:20.223
Dr. Gosnell, we need
the keys that you have

30:20.225 --> 30:21.825
to a padlocked door
in the hallway.

30:21.827 --> 30:24.627
Do you really need to do that?

30:24.629 --> 30:26.297
It's the cellar.

30:26.299 --> 30:28.768
I'm almost ashamed to
let you go down there.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.736
It's a bit messy.

31:10.309 --> 31:12.244
Files have been
moved recently.

31:14.512 --> 31:16.348
Definitely moving stuff around.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.133
Oh.

31:45.176 --> 31:46.344
Stark?

31:47.346 --> 31:48.778
Yeah?

31:48.780 --> 31:50.580
What is this?

31:50.582 --> 31:51.315
Oh God!

31:51.317 --> 31:53.016
Oh, hell no, come on!

31:53.018 --> 31:54.217
Let's go!

31:56.821 --> 31:57.887
Open up!

31:57.889 --> 31:59.155
- Hey!
- Open up!

31:59.157 --> 31:59.823
Come
on, help me with it.

31:59.825 --> 32:00.924
Open up.

32:00.926 --> 32:01.858
We got it, here.

32:01.860 --> 32:02.925
Here, gimme your hand.

32:02.927 --> 32:03.794
Come on, get 'em out.

32:03.796 --> 32:04.694
Get your suits off!

32:04.696 --> 32:06.331
Get it off of me.

32:07.332 --> 32:09.399
Get 'em
off, get 'em off!

32:09.401 --> 32:10.334
Oh shit.

32:10.336 --> 32:11.570
Get this off.

32:13.438 --> 32:14.639
It's disgusting!

32:18.309 --> 32:19.444
What the...

32:20.378 --> 32:22.246
Did someone turn on the radio?

32:23.014 --> 32:25.283
Hey, what's going on in here?

32:29.120 --> 32:30.723
This is a crime scene, people.

32:39.665 --> 32:42.135
I warned you about the mess.

33:16.467 --> 33:18.470
Yes, I'm holding
for Dr. North.

33:19.672 --> 33:21.070
Well, do you know
when she will be in?

33:21.072 --> 33:23.208
This is the third
time I've called.

33:25.176 --> 33:26.378
Yes, please.

33:27.245 --> 33:29.278
ADA Alexis McGuire.

33:29.280 --> 33:30.482
You have my number?

33:32.283 --> 33:36.655
Yeah, okay, thank you.

33:39.524 --> 33:43.058
Hey, Doctor Ray,
I got a man down.

33:43.060 --> 33:44.530
Do you mind taking a look?

33:45.664 --> 33:47.263
It's just a little
ear infection.

33:47.265 --> 33:48.498
I'll call in a prescription
for you, he'll be fine.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.365
Thanks, Doc.

33:49.367 --> 33:50.435
You're the best.

33:51.870 --> 33:54.637
By the way, have you
ever heard of a doctor

33:54.639 --> 33:58.040
cutting an aborted fetus's
neck to ensure fetal demise?

33:58.042 --> 33:59.511
I've never heard of that.

34:00.311 --> 34:02.313
Is this the Gosnell case?

34:02.315 --> 34:04.248
Can I put you
on the witness stand?

34:04.250 --> 34:05.848
Wouldn't testify
in that case about anything.

34:05.850 --> 34:07.584
Doubt you'll find
a doctor who will.

34:07.586 --> 34:08.984
Tell me about it.

34:08.985 --> 34:11.587
My own obstetrician who
just delivered this guy

34:11.589 --> 34:13.022
told me to pound sand.

34:13.024 --> 34:14.889
Well, they all knew
him as a colleague.

34:14.891 --> 34:16.190
Some of them probably even
referred patients to him.

34:16.193 --> 34:17.259
So?

34:17.261 --> 34:18.860
That doesn't make them culpable.

34:18.862 --> 34:20.763
Lexi, it's abortion,
nobody wants to touch that.

34:20.764 --> 34:23.668
Listen, if he's not better
in a couple days, holler.

34:39.150 --> 34:40.216
Here you go.

34:40.217 --> 34:41.884
One medium skinny late.

34:41.886 --> 34:42.886
Name's Lexi.

34:47.591 --> 34:49.324
Excuse me, Ms. McGuire.

34:49.327 --> 34:50.993
Are you gonna be the first
prosecutor in American history

34:50.995 --> 34:53.129
to charge an abortion
doctor with murder?

34:53.130 --> 34:54.531
I'm sorry, who are you?

34:54.533 --> 34:56.569
Mollie Mullaney,
Mullaney Report.

34:59.738 --> 35:02.772
Shouldn't you be at home
in your pajamas or something?

35:02.774 --> 35:04.975
It's free Wi-Fi, so it's
actually reason enough

35:04.977 --> 35:06.442
to get out of bed.

35:06.444 --> 35:08.144
Now, in the past, you've
said that you're pro-choice.

35:08.146 --> 35:09.781
Why are you pursuing this case?

35:11.015 --> 35:13.750
Young lady, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

35:13.752 --> 35:16.086
but I don't speak about
ongoing investigations.

35:16.088 --> 35:19.122
Hmm, have you ever heard
the name Samika Shaw?

35:19.124 --> 35:20.355
No, I haven't.

35:20.357 --> 35:22.091
Really?

35:22.093 --> 35:24.194
Well, she died in 2000 after
being treated by Dr. Gosnell.

35:24.196 --> 35:27.397
Ever heard of the Mother's
Day Massacre in 1972?

35:27.399 --> 35:30.200
Gosnell flew to the Bahamas
for 12 years right after that.

35:30.202 --> 35:31.535
Curious about why?

35:31.537 --> 35:32.734
Well, you can read
about it on my blog,

35:32.736 --> 35:34.904
the links are on the card.

35:34.906 --> 35:36.442
Wait, hold on.

35:37.443 --> 35:39.276
Where are you getting
your information?

35:39.278 --> 35:42.381
Sorry, I don't speak about
ongoing investigations.

36:01.834 --> 36:05.167
Ah kee kee, kee, I
got your toes here.

36:05.169 --> 36:07.504
Chh, chh, clap, clap, clap.

36:30.629 --> 36:34.767
We rehydrated all 47 of the
bodies taken from the fridges.

36:35.767 --> 36:38.901
I think you'll wanna
concentrate on the five largest.

36:38.903 --> 36:41.136
During a legal abortion,
a doctor would definitely

36:41.138 --> 36:44.808
have to empty the skulls to get
'em through the birth canal.

36:44.810 --> 36:48.212
So if we could prove the
skulls weren't emptied...

36:48.214 --> 36:51.517
That would mean they were
probably delivered alive.

37:03.227 --> 37:05.664
How do we know if the
skulls were emptied?

37:10.167 --> 37:11.035
We look.

37:17.642 --> 37:19.145
You just had a baby, Lex.

37:44.970 --> 37:45.838
Hey.

37:55.013 --> 37:55.881
What's going on?

37:57.883 --> 38:03.088
Mother's Day, 1972, Gosnell
and this psychologist,

38:04.189 --> 38:07.593
they bused in 15 pregnant
women from Chicago.

38:09.260 --> 38:10.662
Second trimester.

38:12.097 --> 38:16.299
They were doing
this big experiment,

38:16.301 --> 38:17.700
a demonstration, you know.

38:17.702 --> 38:19.504
They filmed it and everything.

38:21.140 --> 38:24.573
They were testing
this new device

38:24.575 --> 38:26.945
to make abortion easier.

38:30.115 --> 38:32.115
This ball of blades.

38:32.117 --> 38:36.921
They put it inside the woman
and the blades rolled open.

38:42.627 --> 38:44.563
Cut the girls up bad.

38:45.763 --> 38:49.332
Infections, hemorrhages,
one poor girl

38:49.334 --> 38:50.935
had to have a hysterectomy.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.850
You know what
happened to Gosnell?

39:07.952 --> 39:08.886
Nothing.

39:10.155 --> 39:13.857
He hid out in the Bahamas
for a while, came back here,

39:13.859 --> 39:17.596
opened another clinic,
and since then, he's,

39:18.897 --> 39:24.135
he's been, killing babies, Ed.

39:25.002 --> 39:27.439
He's been delivering
babies alive,

39:28.339 --> 39:32.745
and then snipping their
necks with scissors.

39:33.912 --> 39:36.044
Hundreds of them,
thousands maybe,

39:36.046 --> 39:38.182
I don't know, for 30 years.

39:39.084 --> 39:41.185
Because nobody wanted
to say anything.

39:42.988 --> 39:44.756
Nobody wanted to know.

39:50.528 --> 39:52.595
I'm gonna get that bastard.

39:58.803 --> 39:59.669
You didn't pass out.

39:59.671 --> 40:01.404
No, but close.

40:01.406 --> 40:03.305
So, these are the files
that'll go with the other ones.

40:03.307 --> 40:06.277
Yeah, that would
be great, thank you.

40:12.082 --> 40:14.383
Okay, what have we got?

40:14.385 --> 40:16.352
We have written
statements from a number

40:16.354 --> 40:20.223
of untrained staff who saw
Gosnell snip the spinal cords

40:20.225 --> 40:22.258
of the babies after
they were born.

40:22.260 --> 40:24.727
He also directed his unlicensed
staff to administer drugs

40:24.729 --> 40:27.830
to Karnamaya Mongar,
resulting in her death.

40:27.832 --> 40:29.499
And we've gotten
statements to the tune

40:29.501 --> 40:32.935
of over 200 violations of
existing abortion limits,

40:32.937 --> 40:35.770
from the 24-hour rule
to the 24-week rule.

40:35.772 --> 40:37.339
Physical evidence?

40:37.341 --> 40:40.509
The bodies of six
fetuses, babies, whose heads

40:40.511 --> 40:43.779
were not emptied, indicating
they were born intact.

40:43.781 --> 40:45.348
Anything else?

40:45.350 --> 40:47.116
We also have a suspicion
that he was using medical waste

40:47.118 --> 40:48.917
from his clinics and he
was using that as bait

40:48.919 --> 40:50.953
for his crab pots
at his beach house.

40:50.955 --> 40:54.256
Well, that's sick and shocking,
but it's a lesser charge,

40:54.258 --> 40:55.491
abuse of corpse.

40:55.493 --> 40:56.892
It's not murder.

40:56.894 --> 40:58.593
What about that
garbage disposal?

40:58.595 --> 41:00.129
I mean, that thing was clogged
with God only knows what.

41:00.131 --> 41:01.730
There were
probably baby parts...

41:01.732 --> 41:04.433
Again, that does not
speak to a murder charge.

41:04.435 --> 41:06.301
Now listen.

41:06.303 --> 41:10.772
I heard Gosnell put
Mike Cohan on retainer.

41:10.774 --> 41:12.508
He's tough.

41:12.510 --> 41:15.213
If I was in this trouble, I'd
want him representing me too.

41:16.747 --> 41:17.648
Lexi.

41:18.450 --> 41:20.549
You have to
understand completely

41:20.551 --> 41:22.417
what it is you're doing here.

41:22.419 --> 41:26.122
You are prosecuting an
abortion doctor for murder.

41:26.124 --> 41:29.892
That man took babies
that he medically induced

41:29.894 --> 41:31.294
to be born alive...

41:31.296 --> 41:35.298
Yes, yes, but you know
how Cohan will play it.

41:35.300 --> 41:37.933
And you know how it
will play in the media.

41:37.935 --> 41:40.270
If you try this case
and lose, you can kiss

41:40.272 --> 41:43.339
any sort of political position
with the governor goodbye.

41:44.743 --> 41:47.509
You'll be the prosecutor who
went after reproductive rights.

41:47.511 --> 41:51.149
An activist ADA and you'll
be a racist to boot.

41:52.417 --> 41:56.651
There is nothing that man
did illegally for 30 years

41:56.653 --> 41:59.488
that protects women or children

41:59.490 --> 42:02.760
and you don't have to be a
pro-life activist to see that.

42:04.495 --> 42:05.463
All right.

42:06.798 --> 42:08.232
But you better win.

42:09.700 --> 42:11.868
Your Honor, we believe
there is sufficient evidence

42:11.870 --> 42:16.105
to prove that Karnamaya Mongar
was murdered by Dr. Gosnell

42:16.107 --> 42:20.209
and that he murdered a number
of infants born alive...

42:20.211 --> 42:22.212
All right, stop right there.

42:22.214 --> 42:24.680
This is not a case
about abortion.

42:24.682 --> 42:25.881
You hear me?

42:25.883 --> 42:26.918
I hear you.

42:28.019 --> 42:30.453
You bring this
to my grand jury,

42:30.455 --> 42:33.189
I'm the one who signs
off on the report,

42:33.191 --> 42:37.427
and that report
will not, will not

42:38.363 --> 42:41.332
bring a woman's right
to chose into question.

42:42.501 --> 42:45.368
In this state, you've got
a lot of conservative folk

42:45.370 --> 42:47.572
who'd like to see
abortion outlawed

42:48.472 --> 42:51.073
and this is not
going to be the case

42:51.075 --> 42:53.078
that gives them an excuse.

42:54.646 --> 42:57.312
That's the way you're
going to try it,

42:57.314 --> 43:01.017
because that's the only
way I'll sign off on it.

43:02.720 --> 43:03.789
Understood?

43:20.537 --> 43:24.040
As an intern, you saw
the conditions of the clinic.

43:24.042 --> 43:25.140
Oh yeah.

43:25.142 --> 43:27.509
There was dirt everywhere.

43:27.511 --> 43:30.513
Instruments being reused
without sterilization.

43:30.515 --> 43:33.149
Sometimes the patients
would have to urinate

43:33.151 --> 43:36.151
in the halls because
the bathrooms were busy.

43:36.153 --> 43:37.789
No one even cleaned it up.

43:39.423 --> 43:40.823
As a nursing student,

43:40.825 --> 43:43.260
why didn't you
report any of this?

43:44.194 --> 43:46.529
I just thought that's
the way they did things

43:46.531 --> 43:48.367
in an inner city clinic.

43:49.501 --> 43:51.600
I was referring
patients to Gosnell

43:51.602 --> 43:55.039
and they were returning with
sexually transmitted diseases.

43:55.841 --> 43:57.406
I got suspicious.

43:57.408 --> 44:00.609
I asked a social worker
to check the place out.

44:00.611 --> 44:05.048
She found appallingly dirty
conditions, untrained personnel,

44:05.050 --> 44:08.250
single use instruments
being used repeatedly.

44:08.252 --> 44:09.653
So you
filed a complaint

44:09.655 --> 44:11.386
with the State
Department of Health?

44:11.388 --> 44:15.125
I hand delivered that
complaint to the DOH personally.

44:15.127 --> 44:16.225
And their response?

44:16.227 --> 44:17.896
They never got back to me.

44:21.633 --> 44:27.004
When I said I wanted
to stop, he yelled at me.

44:27.839 --> 44:30.875
He slapped my leg real hard.

44:32.010 --> 44:35.111
Do you remember
exactly what he said to you?

44:35.113 --> 44:38.951
He told me, "Stop
acting like a baby."

44:39.818 --> 44:41.252
All of the nurses did.

44:42.187 --> 44:44.355
And then I passed out.

44:45.490 --> 44:50.495
And when I woke back up, I
knew I wasn't pregnant no more.

44:54.399 --> 44:56.866
I asked Dr.
Gosnell what happened

44:56.868 --> 44:58.234
to the babies afterwards.

44:58.236 --> 45:00.102
He said, "We burn 'em."

45:00.104 --> 45:01.671
So I told him I changed my mind.

45:01.673 --> 45:04.240
He got really mad at me,
told me it was too late.

45:04.242 --> 45:06.910
Said the procedure
couldn't be reversed.

45:06.912 --> 45:09.712
But the laminaria
had already been placed

45:09.714 --> 45:11.013
in your cervix, right?

45:11.015 --> 45:12.314
So what did you do?

45:12.316 --> 45:14.351
I went to Children's
Hospital instead.

45:15.287 --> 45:16.718
And were they able
to help you out?

45:16.720 --> 45:17.787
Oh yes.

45:17.789 --> 45:19.057
I had my baby.

45:20.993 --> 45:22.258
The prosecution
has offered you

45:22.260 --> 45:24.294
a plea bargain, Dr. Gosnell.

45:24.296 --> 45:26.296
Your wife and daughter
would keep the house,

45:26.298 --> 45:28.064
your wife would
avoid prosecution,

45:28.066 --> 45:29.899
and you would avoid
the death penalty.

45:29.901 --> 45:33.169
But, I would have to admit
I was guilty.

45:33.171 --> 45:34.904
That is correct.

45:34.906 --> 45:37.605
Why on Earth would
I wanna do that?

45:37.607 --> 45:38.910
I'm not guilty.

45:42.147 --> 45:43.912
In that case, let me
ask you some questions

45:43.914 --> 45:45.515
that the prosecution
might ask you

45:45.517 --> 45:47.350
in the event we go to trial.

45:47.352 --> 45:50.422
I look forward to the
opportunity to tell my story.

45:52.624 --> 45:55.890
Well, the DA alleges that
you performed abortions

45:55.892 --> 45:57.361
past the legal limit.

45:58.664 --> 46:01.633
I was a close friend of
George Tiller, you know.

46:02.901 --> 46:04.000
I'm sorry?

46:04.002 --> 46:06.035
He was a sweet, gentle man.

46:06.037 --> 46:07.736
A martyr, really.

46:07.738 --> 46:10.841
But they said that he
performed late abortions too,

46:11.975 --> 46:15.646
and for that, he was struck
down by an assassin's bullet.

46:19.684 --> 46:22.685
Well, to get back
on point, Dr. Gosnell,

46:22.687 --> 46:26.990
let's say a woman came
to you, desperate,

46:26.992 --> 46:28.825
past the 24-week limit.

46:28.827 --> 46:31.794
Would you be inclined
to give her an abortion?

46:31.796 --> 46:33.162
Yes.

46:33.164 --> 46:36.064
I've asked myself what
if your own daughter

46:36.066 --> 46:37.667
were in this situation?

46:37.669 --> 46:40.870
Would you want her to have
access to an abortion?

46:40.872 --> 46:43.975
To not have her life
changed forever by a baby?

46:45.510 --> 46:47.109
I looked at all
the women I treated

46:47.111 --> 46:49.013
as if they were my own daughter.

46:50.615 --> 46:52.080
Many of the files
in your office

46:52.082 --> 46:54.817
you had written 24.5 weeks.

46:54.819 --> 46:56.718
Are you aware that 24.5 weeks

46:56.720 --> 46:58.754
is past the legal
limit for abortion?

46:58.756 --> 47:03.392
I suppose I
assumed as in mathematics,

47:03.394 --> 47:06.664
that the number would be
rounded down to 24.

47:08.466 --> 47:10.732
Well, actually,
in mathematics that number

47:10.734 --> 47:12.535
would be rounded up,
but are you saying

47:12.537 --> 47:15.004
that that number
was an estimation

47:15.006 --> 47:17.173
and not a scientifically
deduced fact?

47:17.175 --> 47:19.676
If you read the law, it states

47:19.678 --> 47:23.645
that the measure of viability
is up to the physician.

47:23.647 --> 47:28.852
So, if I assessed that it is
of a lower gestational age,

47:29.553 --> 47:30.854
then that's what rules today.

47:31.622 --> 47:33.388
So your interpretation
of the law

47:33.390 --> 47:36.125
is that whatever you
decide to write down

47:36.127 --> 47:37.459
should be accepted.

47:37.461 --> 47:38.329
Yes.

47:40.664 --> 47:44.133
You kept the feet of
aborted babies in jars.

47:44.135 --> 47:45.633
Why?

47:45.635 --> 47:50.272
It's often necessary
to preserve the DNA

47:50.274 --> 47:52.142
for later identification.

47:52.144 --> 47:54.276
It's customary for
physicians to preserve

47:54.278 --> 47:57.113
a small sample, but
not a whole foot.

47:57.115 --> 47:59.117
See, these are
scientific matters.

48:00.051 --> 48:02.151
I can't expect a
layman to understand

48:02.153 --> 48:05.122
the complex nature
of my research.

48:06.223 --> 48:08.357
Is it true that you
allowed your unlicensed

48:08.359 --> 48:11.127
and untrained staff to
administer anesthesia

48:11.129 --> 48:14.629
and even to perform medical
procedures in your absence?

48:14.631 --> 48:16.799
They were properly trained.

48:16.801 --> 48:18.067
I trained 'em myself.

48:18.069 --> 48:19.801
But you are aware
that there are laws

48:19.803 --> 48:23.772
governing the licensing and
training of medical personnel?

48:23.774 --> 48:25.309
These laws.

48:26.276 --> 48:27.343
They've always struck me

48:27.345 --> 48:29.948
as being politically motivated.

48:30.848 --> 48:33.682
The enemies of
abortion erected them

48:33.684 --> 48:38.256
to create barriers between
women and my services.

48:39.758 --> 48:42.461
I have no respect for
these laws whatsoever.

48:43.662 --> 48:47.631
These poor women who need me

48:49.868 --> 48:51.236
have nowhere else to go.

48:57.207 --> 48:58.475
You are an inspector

48:58.477 --> 49:00.276
for the Department
of Health, correct?

49:00.278 --> 49:01.644
Correct.

49:01.646 --> 49:03.111
And when was the
last time your division

49:03.113 --> 49:05.747
inspected Dr. Gosnell's clinic?

49:05.749 --> 49:06.982
1993.

49:06.984 --> 49:09.620
And then when the
FBI raided the place.

49:10.488 --> 49:12.955
17 years between inspections.

49:12.957 --> 49:14.756
We were told not
to do any inspections

49:14.758 --> 49:16.892
unless we received complaints.

49:16.894 --> 49:19.763
And you received no
complaints about Gosnell?

49:28.506 --> 49:30.341
Can you tell me what these are?

49:32.176 --> 49:33.341
I'll tell you what they are.

49:33.343 --> 49:34.442
They're complaints.

49:34.444 --> 49:36.414
Why didn't you do an inspection?

49:37.147 --> 49:39.015
We had instructions directly

49:39.017 --> 49:40.348
from Governor Ridge's office

49:40.350 --> 49:41.984
not to inspect abortion clinics.

49:41.986 --> 49:43.386
Why?

49:43.388 --> 49:44.453
It would hamper
women from exercising

49:44.455 --> 49:45.821
their reproductive rights.

49:45.823 --> 49:48.191
Are you aware that a
woman, Karnamaya Mongar,

49:48.193 --> 49:51.959
died of complications from an
abortion at Gosnell's clinic?

49:51.961 --> 49:53.495
I believe so, yes.

49:53.497 --> 49:55.798
Is it true the DOH
requires nail salons

49:55.800 --> 49:58.801
to be inspected at
least once a year?

49:58.803 --> 50:00.002
Yes.

50:00.004 --> 50:01.537
If someone had
died at a nail salon,

50:01.539 --> 50:03.973
would you have
inspected it then?

50:03.975 --> 50:05.473
Look.

50:05.475 --> 50:07.778
Accidents happen during
medical procedures.

50:08.446 --> 50:09.779
People die.

50:34.638 --> 50:37.408
So this is what happens
when you try to help people?

50:51.622 --> 50:53.555
Dr. Kermit Gosnell.

50:53.557 --> 50:55.890
You are charged with
eight counts of murder

50:55.892 --> 50:57.228
in the first degree,

50:58.095 --> 51:00.863
24 counts of illegal abortion,

51:00.865 --> 51:04.533
and 227 misdemeanor violations

51:04.535 --> 51:07.705
of the 24-hour
abortion consent law.

51:08.539 --> 51:09.707
How do you plead?

51:10.640 --> 51:12.910
My client pleads not
guilty, Your Honor.

51:14.379 --> 51:17.145
I order you remanded
to custody to await trial.

51:17.147 --> 51:19.649
Your Honor, I'm
prepared to pay bail.

51:19.651 --> 51:21.616
This is a capital
murder case, Dr. Gosnell.

51:21.618 --> 51:23.821
Bail is not a possibility.

51:24.756 --> 51:26.022
Do you have anything
else you'd like to say

51:26.024 --> 51:27.790
before this indictment
is handed down?

51:27.792 --> 51:29.057
Oh my.

51:29.059 --> 51:29.961
Yes, Your Honor.

51:31.129 --> 51:33.796
I'm quite concerned about
the turtles in my clinic.

51:33.798 --> 51:35.665
They're an endangered species

51:35.667 --> 51:38.734
and I've filed several
requests for them to be moved.

51:38.736 --> 51:41.738
Counselor, you will
have to deal with this.

51:41.740 --> 51:44.473
Your Honor, this is a
very complicated case.

51:44.475 --> 51:46.109
I think we have
higher priorities

51:46.111 --> 51:49.377
than worrying about Dr. Gosnell's
illegally obtained pets.

51:49.379 --> 51:53.049
I take the Endangered
Species Act very seriously.

51:53.051 --> 51:54.984
You are going to
have to figure out

51:54.986 --> 51:58.153
how to deal with these
vulnerable creatures.

51:59.823 --> 52:01.526
Thank you, Your Honor.

52:03.660 --> 52:05.562
Not an animal
lover, Ms. McGuire?

52:18.343 --> 52:22.544
All right, you guys have
never handled a case like this.

52:22.546 --> 52:23.814
You need to be ready.

52:24.948 --> 52:28.183
Kermit Gosnell is perhaps the
most prolific serial killer

52:28.185 --> 52:29.951
in American history,

52:29.953 --> 52:32.187
but he is also an
abortion doctor,

52:32.189 --> 52:34.522
a major hot button issue.

52:34.524 --> 52:36.392
That makes him big news.

52:36.394 --> 52:38.194
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

52:38.196 --> 52:40.629
this is gonna be a long trial.

52:40.631 --> 52:42.365
When you get to
the courthouse,

52:42.367 --> 52:45.866
you are going to be swarmed
by reporters, swamped by them.

52:45.868 --> 52:48.136
They are gonna be
shouting questions at you,

52:48.138 --> 52:52.274
snapping pictures, sticking
microphones in your faces.

52:53.944 --> 52:56.845
The courtroom is going to
be packed to overflowing.

52:56.847 --> 52:58.781
You won't be able
to use the toilet

52:58.783 --> 53:01.417
without one of them
sticking their heads out

53:01.419 --> 53:03.154
to ask you for an interview.

53:04.122 --> 53:07.589
So, remember, take
a breath, stay calm,

53:07.591 --> 53:09.591
say the case will
be tried in court

53:09.593 --> 53:11.896
and decided by the
jury and that's all.

53:12.897 --> 53:14.529
When we get there,
I want you to head

53:14.531 --> 53:16.464
right into the courtroom.

53:16.466 --> 53:18.435
I'll stop and
speak to the press.

53:20.805 --> 53:22.607
You ready for this, counselor?

53:43.359 --> 53:44.796
I'll be damned.

54:03.847 --> 54:05.482
Where is everybody?

54:11.354 --> 54:12.421
Hello!

54:12.423 --> 54:14.089
Well, how pretty you look today.

54:14.091 --> 54:16.325
Don't tell me you know how
to work that contraption.

54:20.497 --> 54:21.964
Hello, counselor.

54:21.966 --> 54:24.702
My, what a lovely blouse.

54:28.037 --> 54:30.641
This is not a
case about abortion.

54:31.542 --> 54:33.575
This is a case about murder.

54:33.577 --> 54:35.877
The murder of Karnamaya Mongar

54:35.879 --> 54:40.883
and the murder of seven infants
born alive and then killed.

54:40.885 --> 54:42.886
That's what I want
you to focus on.

54:43.687 --> 54:45.720
The murder of those babies.

54:45.722 --> 54:47.823
Not that they were
there to be aborted,

54:47.825 --> 54:50.625
not whatever their
mothers had in mind,

54:50.627 --> 54:56.033
but what happened to those
babies after they were born alive

54:56.499 --> 54:57.501
into this world.

55:03.073 --> 55:06.375
They've come up with one
tragic death, Karnamaya Mongar.

55:06.377 --> 55:09.845
One death in 31 years and
they think that one case

55:09.847 --> 55:11.549
makes this man a monster.

55:12.484 --> 55:14.250
I mean, to hear the
Commonwealth talk,

55:14.252 --> 55:16.584
you'd think people
were just dropping dead

55:16.586 --> 55:18.654
right in front of
that clinic every day,

55:18.656 --> 55:20.890
the corpses just piling
up on the sidewalk,

55:20.892 --> 55:23.325
right there in front of
3801 Lancaster Avenue.

55:23.327 --> 55:27.462
But no, this man's clinic has
been in operation for years,

55:27.464 --> 55:29.566
in '78, '79, '80, '81,

55:31.068 --> 55:31.970
'82, '83, '84.

55:33.169 --> 55:35.537
Year after year after
year of this man

55:35.539 --> 55:38.341
successfully treating his
patients and giving them

55:38.343 --> 55:40.042
the services they requested.

55:40.044 --> 55:41.410
Some of them even coming back

55:41.412 --> 55:43.145
for a third or fourth procedure.

55:43.147 --> 55:46.618
Why would they come back if
this man was such a monster?

55:49.687 --> 55:51.020
The Commonwealth
wants to tell you

55:51.022 --> 55:53.488
that this is not a
case about abortion.

55:54.825 --> 55:57.292
This absolutely is a
case about abortion,

55:57.294 --> 55:58.362
ladies and gentlemen.

55:59.463 --> 56:02.830
And if you stay true to your
oath and you look at the facts,

56:02.832 --> 56:04.200
you will see what I see.

56:05.102 --> 56:07.837
An overly zealous
Catholic investigator

56:07.839 --> 56:11.307
in a police department
dominated by Catholicism

56:11.309 --> 56:15.044
and a targeted, racist,
prosecutorial lynching

56:15.046 --> 56:17.946
of a man who has done nothing
but serve the citizens

56:17.948 --> 56:21.015
of West Philadelphia for
decades in neighborhoods

56:21.017 --> 56:22.952
they wouldn't even set foot in.

56:23.921 --> 56:25.890
Hey man, I think
he convinced me.

56:30.560 --> 56:31.926
Really, Cohan?

56:31.928 --> 56:32.993
That's how you're
gonna play this?

56:32.995 --> 56:34.062
We're a bunch of racists?

56:34.064 --> 56:35.631
Woody, get a hold of yourself.

56:35.633 --> 56:37.165
You gonna bring my
religion into this, really?

56:37.167 --> 56:38.299
- Woody, back off!
- Is that you

56:38.301 --> 56:39.368
wanna make this about,

56:39.370 --> 56:40.502
- you asshole?
- Hey, hey, hey.

56:40.504 --> 56:41.870
- Do you?
- Stop it!

56:41.872 --> 56:43.138
Woody, hey, calm
down, all right?

56:43.140 --> 56:44.406
Hey, keep your mouth
quiet, all right?

56:44.408 --> 56:45.540
That outburst, it needs to stop.

56:45.542 --> 56:46.743
That could cost us a mistrial.

56:47.678 --> 56:48.810
In this interview

56:48.812 --> 56:50.044
conducted before
he was arrested,

56:50.046 --> 56:52.615
Dr. Gosnell told
News 11 he believes

56:52.617 --> 56:54.116
he will be fully vindicated.

56:55.385 --> 56:57.017
I hadn't been aware
of how hard I'd been

56:57.019 --> 56:58.687
working until I got
a couple of days off.

57:00.591 --> 57:03.357
My feeling is that if
you're not making mistakes,

57:03.359 --> 57:07.164
then you're not really attempting
to do anything of value.

57:07.830 --> 57:10.098
So I think my patients are aware

57:10.100 --> 57:12.169
that I'm doing my
very best by them.

57:12.970 --> 57:16.506
I provide the standard of care

57:17.640 --> 57:21.178
for them that I would
want for my own daughter.

57:22.479 --> 57:24.613
Dr. Gosnell's
considered by authorities

57:24.615 --> 57:26.013
to be a flight risk.

57:26.015 --> 57:27.649
Currently, he's being
held without bail

57:27.651 --> 57:29.654
in the Philadelphia County Jail.

57:31.089 --> 57:32.854
Dr. North, can
you tell the jury

57:32.856 --> 57:35.089
why you decided
to testify today?

57:35.091 --> 57:37.392
I didn't want anyone to
think that Dr. Gosnell's clinic

57:37.394 --> 57:40.261
represents what women's
clinics are really like.

57:40.263 --> 57:43.031
Do you ever
perform non-emergency

57:43.033 --> 57:45.466
pregnancy terminations
after 24 weeks?

57:45.468 --> 57:47.002
No, never.

57:47.004 --> 57:49.004
Always we stop at 20 weeks.

57:49.006 --> 57:52.174
Do you reuse instruments
on different patients

57:52.176 --> 57:53.676
that haven't been sterilized?

57:53.678 --> 57:54.979
No, never.

57:56.080 --> 57:58.779
Do you ever allow
untrained personnel

57:58.781 --> 58:01.716
to say, administer anesthesia?

58:01.718 --> 58:03.084
No.

58:03.086 --> 58:05.287
Everyone in our office
is a registered nurse

58:05.289 --> 58:07.892
and I administer the
anesthesia myself.

58:09.459 --> 58:14.798
Dr. North, have you ever cut
a baby's spine with scissors?

58:15.798 --> 58:18.167
No, we would not do that.

58:18.169 --> 58:19.901
Do you know any
doctor that would?

58:19.903 --> 58:20.937
No, I do not.

58:21.906 --> 58:23.441
Thank you, no
further questions.

58:27.010 --> 58:29.211
Dr. North,
how many abortions

58:29.213 --> 58:32.046
would you say you've
performed in your career?

58:32.048 --> 58:34.851
I have performed
over 30,000 abortions.

58:35.653 --> 58:36.486
Wow.

58:37.687 --> 58:41.223
In the second trimester, what
method of abortion do you use?

58:41.225 --> 58:44.158
Mostly D&E, dilation
and evacuation.

58:44.160 --> 58:45.060
Yes.

58:45.062 --> 58:47.029
Dilation is where you soften

58:47.031 --> 58:50.131
and widen the woman's
cervix, correct?

58:50.133 --> 58:51.700
That is correct.

58:51.702 --> 58:53.401
Once the fetus grows
larger, it's very important

58:53.403 --> 58:55.837
that we do that to
prevent the cervix

58:55.839 --> 58:58.207
from tearing as the
fetus is removed.

58:58.209 --> 59:00.843
And then you
evacuate the fetus.

59:00.845 --> 59:02.678
You remove it from the womb.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.279
Yes.

59:04.281 --> 59:06.548
But first, we have to make sure
that it's not a live birth.

59:06.550 --> 59:09.951
Oh, of course, of
course, how do you do that?

59:09.953 --> 59:11.787
Well, we inject
potassium chloride

59:11.789 --> 59:14.223
into the heart of the fetus.

59:14.225 --> 59:15.059
Hmm.

59:17.995 --> 59:20.064
With one of these, correct?

59:22.133 --> 59:22.966
Yes.

59:25.336 --> 59:28.535
Your Honor, I'd like to
introduce defense exhibit 1A

59:28.537 --> 59:29.404
on the screen.

59:29.406 --> 59:30.138
May I publish?

59:30.140 --> 59:31.274
You may publish.

59:34.278 --> 59:39.450
Now, this is a sonogram
of a 23-week-old fetus.

59:40.417 --> 59:42.283
And so when you
inject the fetus,

59:42.285 --> 59:44.553
do you put the needle here?

59:44.555 --> 59:45.423
No.

59:47.457 --> 59:48.557
Here?

59:48.559 --> 59:49.723
Yes.

59:49.725 --> 59:50.794
Right there.

59:51.727 --> 59:53.162
And that stops the heart.

59:53.164 --> 59:54.232
That's correct.

59:56.732 --> 59:58.836
And then you use forceps.

01:00:02.071 --> 01:00:04.372
You use these and
you reach up in there

01:00:04.374 --> 01:00:08.377
and you grab ahold
of an arm or a leg

01:00:08.379 --> 01:00:10.278
or whatever and you pull on it

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:14.515
until it comes out or
comes off, correct?

01:00:14.517 --> 01:00:15.850
That's correct.

01:00:15.852 --> 01:00:18.486
But with larger fetuses,
they remain intact.

01:00:18.488 --> 01:00:20.756
Of course, because
the head's bigger.

01:00:20.758 --> 01:00:22.890
Makes it more difficult.

01:00:22.892 --> 01:00:24.493
What do you do then?

01:00:24.495 --> 01:00:27.162
We use a machine to
suction out the gray matter.

01:00:27.164 --> 01:00:29.430
The gray matter, the brains.

01:00:29.432 --> 01:00:32.700
So, you suction out the
brains and then what happens?

01:00:32.702 --> 01:00:36.671
Then the skull collapses
and the fetus can be removed.

01:00:36.673 --> 01:00:37.541
Right.

01:00:41.011 --> 01:00:42.644
Now, isn't it true
that sometimes,

01:00:42.646 --> 01:00:45.513
in order to get the suction
machine into the fetus,

01:00:45.515 --> 01:00:47.214
you have to use a
pair of scissors

01:00:47.216 --> 01:00:49.854
to make a hole in
the back of the neck?

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.988
Sometimes this happens, yes.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:55.557
So before, when you said
that you'd never cut the neck

01:00:55.559 --> 01:00:56.926
of a fetus...

01:00:56.928 --> 01:00:58.325
I was referring
to a live birth.

01:00:58.327 --> 01:00:59.227
Oh.

01:00:59.229 --> 01:01:01.231
Oh, okay, yeah, I get it now.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.667
Have you ever had a live birth

01:01:04.669 --> 01:01:06.267
during an abortion
attempt, doctor?

01:01:06.269 --> 01:01:08.337
No, I have not,
because we listen

01:01:08.339 --> 01:01:11.973
to the sonogram to ensure that
the fetal heart has stopped.

01:01:11.975 --> 01:01:13.408
Well, what if
you made a mistake?

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:14.209
We don't.

01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:15.642
Well, what if you did?

01:01:15.644 --> 01:01:17.145
Objection,
hypothetical, Your Honor.

01:01:17.147 --> 01:01:18.913
Your Honor, she's
a medical expert.

01:01:18.915 --> 01:01:20.948
I'd like to have her opinion.

01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:22.783
Overruled.

01:01:22.785 --> 01:01:24.086
I'm going to allow the question,

01:01:24.088 --> 01:01:26.022
but stay on point, counselor.

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:29.156
What would you do
if the baby was out

01:01:29.158 --> 01:01:30.528
and it was breathing?

01:01:31.961 --> 01:01:35.796
We would issue comfort care.

01:01:35.798 --> 01:01:37.232
Comfort care.

01:01:37.234 --> 01:01:39.103
Can you define that for us?

01:01:40.236 --> 01:01:43.441
That's keeping the fetus
warm and comfortable.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.609
Eventually, it will pass.

01:01:46.776 --> 01:01:49.079
Eventually, it would pass.

01:01:53.182 --> 01:01:54.484
So basically, you'd,

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.356
you'd let it die.

01:02:05.428 --> 01:02:06.962
Seems like it'd be more humane

01:02:06.964 --> 01:02:08.162
to just take a
pair of scissors...

01:02:08.164 --> 01:02:09.765
Objection!

01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:12.336
Withdraw the
question, Your Honor.

01:02:53.176 --> 01:02:54.776
Yashoda, you were there

01:02:54.778 --> 01:02:57.845
on the night your mother,
Karnamaya Mongar died.

01:02:57.847 --> 01:02:59.446
Yes.

01:02:59.448 --> 01:03:01.049
I went with her to clinic
and I walked down hall

01:03:01.051 --> 01:03:02.651
with her to see doctor.

01:03:04.354 --> 01:03:06.321
No, no, no, no!

01:03:06.323 --> 01:03:07.955
Just put
her on the table.

01:03:07.957 --> 01:03:09.457
Doctor, doctor!

01:03:09.459 --> 01:03:11.292
- No, no.
- Just take these.

01:03:11.294 --> 01:03:12.593
- Please, Mama.
- You need to take

01:03:12.595 --> 01:03:13.729
- these right now.
- You're gonna have to

01:03:13.731 --> 01:03:14.796
wait in the other room.

01:03:15.598 --> 01:03:16.531
Call doctor.

01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:21.069
I called doctor 'cause
I didn't think Lydia

01:03:21.071 --> 01:03:22.171
knew what she was doing,

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:23.504
and Ms. Mongar was putting up

01:03:23.506 --> 01:03:25.339
- such a fuss.
- Oh ladies.

01:03:25.341 --> 01:03:26.876
Well, med her up.

01:03:28.077 --> 01:03:30.611
When he said "med her up,"
did you know what he meant?

01:03:30.613 --> 01:03:31.745
Yeah.

01:03:31.747 --> 01:03:33.647
He liked using Demerol
'cause it was cheap

01:03:33.649 --> 01:03:35.049
and it worked fast.

01:03:35.051 --> 01:03:38.454
Give her some intravenously
until she calms down.

01:03:39.388 --> 01:03:43.727
I'll be there presently.

01:03:53.437 --> 01:03:55.406
I seen doctor come in

01:03:58.508 --> 01:04:00.774
and I knew he was
there for Mama,

01:04:00.776 --> 01:04:03.780
but he stop at the
desk a long time.

01:04:07.151 --> 01:04:09.685
Finally, he went
downstairs and I thought

01:04:09.687 --> 01:04:12.757
I was supposed to
wait, so I did.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.995
Well,
that ought to do it.

01:04:20.997 --> 01:04:22.732
Let's get her into recovery.

01:04:23.633 --> 01:04:25.133
Doctor, she
don't look so good.

01:04:25.135 --> 01:04:26.504
She's a funny color.

01:04:35.211 --> 01:04:36.245
Oh my.

01:04:37.247 --> 01:04:38.312
Doctor went and
got the crash cart

01:04:38.314 --> 01:04:39.881
from up on the third floor.

01:04:39.883 --> 01:04:42.417
We tried to use the paddles
but they were broke.

01:04:42.419 --> 01:04:44.453
Then he just sort of stopped.

01:04:44.455 --> 01:04:49.160
I'm just thrilled that we
kept this cart up to date.

01:04:51.694 --> 01:04:52.562
Hello?

01:04:53.497 --> 01:04:54.365
Hello?

01:04:56.732 --> 01:04:59.433
I couldn't wait anymore,
so I ran down there,

01:04:59.435 --> 01:05:00.805
make them let me in.

01:05:04.573 --> 01:05:08.042
Lydia, plug in that
oximeter in there.

01:05:08.044 --> 01:05:09.276
That oximeter don't work.

01:05:09.278 --> 01:05:10.481
Plug it in anyway!

01:05:12.314 --> 01:05:15.183
And throw all that
expired medicine away.

01:05:15.185 --> 01:05:16.286
Okay.

01:05:17.187 --> 01:05:19.522
And make sure we clean
up the floor there.

01:05:20.758 --> 01:05:23.560
We only get one chance to
make a first impression.

01:05:31.635 --> 01:05:34.336
And when you got
in, how was your mother?

01:05:34.338 --> 01:05:37.839
She, she, she was out.

01:05:37.841 --> 01:05:39.510
She never woke up again.

01:05:44.247 --> 01:05:46.247
We took her to the hospital,

01:05:46.249 --> 01:05:48.886
but she died the next day.

01:05:51.955 --> 01:05:55.522
To your best recollection,
how long was it

01:05:55.524 --> 01:05:58.459
from the time you saw your
mother was unconscious

01:05:58.461 --> 01:06:00.463
until she was put
in the ambulance?

01:06:01.531 --> 01:06:05.870
I think maybe one,
maybe one and a half hour.

01:06:07.636 --> 01:06:09.506
No more questions, Your Honor.

01:06:17.214 --> 01:06:20.615
Ms. Mongar, I cannot
imagine what a painful time

01:06:20.617 --> 01:06:22.283
that must have been for
you and your family.

01:06:22.285 --> 01:06:25.222
I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

01:06:27.022 --> 01:06:31.459
Can you tell us why your
mother was seeking an abortion?

01:06:31.461 --> 01:06:33.361
We just moved to America.

01:06:33.363 --> 01:06:36.932
We had refugee food
stamps running out

01:06:36.934 --> 01:06:40.370
and my mother saying
no work with baby.

01:06:41.472 --> 01:06:43.807
Did you want your mother
to have an abortion?

01:06:46.176 --> 01:06:47.044
No.

01:06:48.211 --> 01:06:50.377
Did you tell your mother
that you didn't want her

01:06:50.379 --> 01:06:51.582
to have an abortion?

01:06:57.588 --> 01:06:58.689
Yes.

01:07:02.892 --> 01:07:05.325
Did your mother go
to any other clinics

01:07:05.327 --> 01:07:07.397
before she came to Dr. Gosnell?

01:07:10.066 --> 01:07:11.299
Yes.

01:07:11.301 --> 01:07:12.801
And what did they say?

01:07:12.803 --> 01:07:14.738
Why didn't she
have it done there?

01:07:15.839 --> 01:07:19.908
The first say too
late, past 14 weeks,

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:22.410
others say too risky.

01:07:22.412 --> 01:07:23.480
Too risky.

01:07:24.546 --> 01:07:26.249
They said it was too risky?

01:07:27.984 --> 01:07:29.319
Yes.

01:07:33.189 --> 01:07:35.589
Ms. Mongar, do
you recall a letter

01:07:35.591 --> 01:07:37.760
that Dr. Gosnell
wrote your family?

01:07:38.727 --> 01:07:41.932
Yes, my uncle read it to me.

01:07:44.334 --> 01:07:45.969
Do you remember this section?

01:07:47.102 --> 01:07:49.669
One moment I feel confident
that I did everything possible.

01:07:49.671 --> 01:07:52.140
In the next, I'm very down.

01:07:52.142 --> 01:07:53.774
I'm not a wealthy individual.

01:07:53.776 --> 01:07:56.345
My lower fees are a reflection
of what my neighbors

01:07:56.347 --> 01:07:58.446
can afford, but
please let me know

01:07:58.448 --> 01:08:02.786
if there is any way that I
can compensate for your loss.

01:08:05.354 --> 01:08:06.687
Do you remember that?

01:08:06.689 --> 01:08:08.189
Yes.

01:08:08.191 --> 01:08:11.392
Does that sorrowful letter
sound like it was written

01:08:11.394 --> 01:08:12.394
by a murderer?

01:08:12.396 --> 01:08:13.595
Objection.

01:08:13.597 --> 01:08:14.761
Sustained.

01:08:14.763 --> 01:08:16.831
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:08:24.307 --> 01:08:25.639
You guys are getting
killed in there.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.075
You're a ray of sunshine.

01:08:27.077 --> 01:08:29.042
Ever interview a girl
named Betty Goodwin?

01:08:29.044 --> 01:08:30.511
I told you, I don't
talk to reporters.

01:08:30.513 --> 01:08:32.412
Have you checked
out her photo blog?

01:08:32.413 --> 01:08:33.484
Her what?

01:08:34.383 --> 01:08:35.716
Betty's a bit of a shutterbug.

01:08:35.718 --> 01:08:37.417
She takes pictures
of everything.

01:08:37.419 --> 01:08:39.353
I guarantee you she'd have
some shots inside the clinic.

01:08:39.354 --> 01:08:41.790
I'll send you the link, maybe
your kid can open it for you.

01:08:41.792 --> 01:08:43.256
Don't you need
my email address?

01:08:43.258 --> 01:08:45.259
No, I have it, Detective.

01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:00.841
Before we resume testimony,

01:09:00.843 --> 01:09:02.676
let's do a little housekeeping.

01:09:02.678 --> 01:09:04.912
Is tomorrow the day when
the jury is scheduled

01:09:04.913 --> 01:09:06.947
to visit the women's
clinic, Mrs. McGuire?

01:09:06.948 --> 01:09:08.950
Your Honor, it has
come to our attention

01:09:08.952 --> 01:09:11.819
that there has been an
incident at the clinic.

01:09:11.821 --> 01:09:14.622
Apparently a pipe burst
and the conditions

01:09:14.624 --> 01:09:17.157
are not safe for
the jury to visit.

01:09:18.694 --> 01:09:21.228
We'll remove that
from the schedule.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:25.866
Also, the court has reached a
decision regarding the motion

01:09:25.868 --> 01:09:28.202
by the defense to
dismiss charges regarding

01:09:28.203 --> 01:09:30.805
to Baby B, Baby F, and Baby G

01:09:30.807 --> 01:09:33.274
for insufficient
physical evidence.

01:09:33.276 --> 01:09:35.443
The court grants this motion.

01:09:35.444 --> 01:09:38.446
Jury is instructed to
disregard any evidence

01:09:38.448 --> 01:09:41.050
heretofore presented
regarding those matters.

01:09:41.984 --> 01:09:44.719
Cohan's got the jury
thinking that Gosnell's

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.755
just an ordinary abortion
doctor who cut some corners

01:09:47.756 --> 01:09:50.125
to provide services
to poor black women.

01:09:50.127 --> 01:09:52.995
Now we can't even bring
the jury to that hellhole.

01:09:54.129 --> 01:09:56.831
Well, we're gonna bring
that hellhole to them.

01:09:56.833 --> 01:09:59.033
Your Honor, may it please
the court, the prosecution

01:09:59.035 --> 01:10:01.937
would like permission to
publish previously admitted

01:10:01.939 --> 01:10:04.872
exhibits six, seven,
eight, and nine.

01:10:04.874 --> 01:10:07.875
These are items salvaged
from the Gosnell clinic

01:10:07.877 --> 01:10:10.213
after the damage caused
by the broken pipe.

01:10:11.114 --> 01:10:13.548
Exhibit six is a
gynecological chair

01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:15.849
taken from the second
procedure room.

01:10:15.851 --> 01:10:20.054
Exhibit seven is the waste
disposal unit from the kitchen.

01:10:20.056 --> 01:10:22.793
Exhibit eight is a
broken pulse oximeter.

01:10:23.959 --> 01:10:25.395
Exhibit nine...

01:10:31.168 --> 01:10:32.169
Excuse me.

01:11:01.797 --> 01:11:03.499
You're welcome.

01:11:23.253 --> 01:11:24.318
Can I
quote you on that?

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.189
Yes.

01:11:26.655 --> 01:11:28.421
What happened?

01:11:28.423 --> 01:11:30.461
We made the papers.

01:11:35.265 --> 01:11:36.499
All rise.

01:11:43.472 --> 01:11:44.540
Be seated.

01:11:48.144 --> 01:11:50.812
The jury will notice there is
an increased media presence

01:11:50.814 --> 01:11:51.981
in the room today.

01:11:52.915 --> 01:11:54.616
They are instructed
not to let that affect

01:11:54.618 --> 01:11:56.687
their sense of the
case before them.

01:11:59.555 --> 01:12:01.455
When a white woman would come,

01:12:01.457 --> 01:12:03.858
she would get the room upstairs.

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.527
It was cleaner and more private.

01:12:06.529 --> 01:12:08.996
Did you ever have a
conversation with Dr. Gosnell

01:12:08.998 --> 01:12:12.300
about why his white patients
had a separate room?

01:12:12.302 --> 01:12:14.868
He said that's just
the way of the world.

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:16.136
Who's a racist now?

01:12:16.138 --> 01:12:19.640
Did you ever see
or hear a baby cry?

01:12:19.642 --> 01:12:21.242
Yes.

01:12:21.244 --> 01:12:23.580
This one time, me and
Betty was in the hallway.

01:12:38.561 --> 01:12:40.027
Did you
tell the doctor?

01:12:40.029 --> 01:12:41.763
He said not to worry about it.

01:12:41.765 --> 01:12:43.563
That it happened all the time.

01:12:43.565 --> 01:12:46.533
But about half the time, with
all the Cytotec we was giving,

01:12:46.535 --> 01:12:49.437
the women would deliver before
the doctor could arrive.

01:12:49.439 --> 01:12:52.340
You told us earlier
about the baby that you saw

01:12:52.342 --> 01:12:53.942
swimming in the toilet.

01:12:53.944 --> 01:12:56.743
Were there any other
babies that you can recall

01:12:56.745 --> 01:12:58.679
that were moving or breathing?

01:12:58.681 --> 01:13:00.615
Lydia had called
me over and told me,

01:13:00.617 --> 01:13:02.050
"Come look at this one baby."

01:13:02.052 --> 01:13:04.786
And I seen the baby's
chest going up and down.

01:13:04.788 --> 01:13:06.920
Was anything else
on that baby moving?

01:13:06.922 --> 01:13:08.923
Lydia had pulled the baby hand

01:13:08.925 --> 01:13:10.894
and the baby pulled
his hand back.

01:13:13.296 --> 01:13:14.664
No further questions.

01:13:21.937 --> 01:13:23.306
Miss Strawberry.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.907
So, you were there for the baby

01:13:26.909 --> 01:13:28.710
that was swimming in the toilet.

01:13:28.712 --> 01:13:30.277
Yes.

01:13:30.279 --> 01:13:31.578
You were there the
night you heard the whine

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.413
you thought was a baby's cry.

01:13:33.415 --> 01:13:34.782
Yes.

01:13:34.784 --> 01:13:35.750
And you were there
when the baby breathed

01:13:35.752 --> 01:13:37.218
and moved its arm?

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:38.352
Yes, I was.

01:13:38.354 --> 01:13:40.487
Did you ever see the
movie Forrest Gump?

01:13:40.489 --> 01:13:41.621
Objection.

01:13:41.623 --> 01:13:42.693
I'll allow it.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.425
Yeah, I saw it.

01:13:45.427 --> 01:13:47.795
You remember how he was
at the JFK assassination,

01:13:47.797 --> 01:13:50.098
he was at the I
Have a Dream speech.

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:54.367
Almost every event in American
history, he was there, right?

01:13:54.369 --> 01:13:55.902
I don't know.

01:13:55.904 --> 01:13:57.272
You're just like
Forrest Gump, aren't you?

01:13:57.274 --> 01:13:58.406
You're just everywhere.

01:13:58.408 --> 01:13:59.540
Objection, Your Honor,

01:13:59.542 --> 01:14:00.642
this is ridiculous.

01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:02.242
Sustained.

01:14:02.244 --> 01:14:04.978
Over time, didn't your
personal relationship

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.880
with Dr. Gosnell
begin to deteriorate?

01:14:06.882 --> 01:14:08.349
It was never personal.

01:14:08.351 --> 01:14:11.118
Did you say in your
grand jury testimony,

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.920
"He started hollering at
me like he was my dad.

01:14:13.922 --> 01:14:15.290
"I didn't like it."

01:14:15.292 --> 01:14:16.189
Did you say that?

01:14:16.191 --> 01:14:17.291
Yes.

01:14:17.293 --> 01:14:18.792
Then why did you
continue to work there?

01:14:18.794 --> 01:14:20.428
Because I had a
family to take care of.

01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:23.063
Or because Dr. Gosnell
was paying you good money,

01:14:23.065 --> 01:14:24.831
or maybe because you
had a little something

01:14:24.833 --> 01:14:25.832
going on the side.

01:14:27.537 --> 01:14:30.004
A lot of the employees at
that clinic have been arrested

01:14:30.006 --> 01:14:32.340
on drug trafficking
charges, why haven't you?

01:14:32.342 --> 01:14:33.541
Objection!

01:14:33.543 --> 01:14:34.908
Isn't it true that you
made a deal with the DA

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:36.143
to avoid prosecution?

01:14:36.145 --> 01:14:37.745
Objection!

01:14:37.747 --> 01:14:39.380
Given your personal
animosity for Dr. Gosnell,

01:14:39.382 --> 01:14:40.948
why should we believe
anything you have to say

01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:42.215
- in this courtroom today?
- Your Honor, please!

01:14:42.886 --> 01:14:43.787
Mr. Cohan!

01:14:44.854 --> 01:14:47.554
Mr. Cohan, I warn you, further
outbursts of that nature

01:14:47.556 --> 01:14:50.357
will result in a formal
admonition by the court.

01:14:50.359 --> 01:14:53.627
You do not have the right to
continue to shout questions

01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:55.662
before I have ruled
on an objection.

01:15:00.703 --> 01:15:02.305
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:15:11.346 --> 01:15:12.679
And, I know you think
she gonna talk to me

01:15:12.681 --> 01:15:14.349
just 'cause I'm black.

01:15:14.351 --> 01:15:15.916
I'm still police though.

01:15:15.918 --> 01:15:17.685
I think she's gonna talk to
you because you're Mr. Smooth,

01:15:17.687 --> 01:15:19.252
Mr. Handsome, you
got that deep voice.

01:15:19.254 --> 01:15:20.787
Yeah, man, I'm sure that
gets you excited and everything

01:15:20.789 --> 01:15:23.023
but I don't know if
it's gonna work on her.

01:15:23.025 --> 01:15:24.961
Hey, hey, Betty,
how you doing?

01:15:25.895 --> 01:15:27.261
My mom said I'm not
supposed to talk to you.

01:15:27.263 --> 01:15:28.795
You trying to put
us all in jail.

01:15:28.797 --> 01:15:30.464
No, no, Betty, we're
not even after you.

01:15:30.466 --> 01:15:32.032
The thing is that you're
gonna testify tomorrow...

01:15:32.034 --> 01:15:33.434
There's a thing called
obstruction of justice

01:15:33.436 --> 01:15:34.868
so if there's
information you have...

01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:36.002
Would you shut up
for five seconds?

01:15:36.004 --> 01:15:37.239
Look, I told you everything.

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.540
I can't talk to you.

01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:46.147
That went well.

01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:48.349
I thought you wanted the
black guy to do all the talking.

01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:30.127
This is the baby I saw moving.

01:17:07.396 --> 01:17:08.929
Lex, I need to talk to you.

01:17:08.931 --> 01:17:09.897
Are you kidding me?

01:17:09.899 --> 01:17:10.965
I'm sorry.

01:17:10.967 --> 01:17:11.831
Our daughter is playing.

01:17:11.833 --> 01:17:13.500
I'm really sorry.

01:17:13.502 --> 01:17:14.167
Just one second.

01:17:14.169 --> 01:17:16.006
I'll be right back.

01:17:17.839 --> 01:17:19.575
I'm sorry.

01:17:22.378 --> 01:17:24.377
Woody, my daughter is next.

01:17:24.379 --> 01:17:25.144
Got it.

01:17:25.146 --> 01:17:26.283
You need to see this.

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.187
Betty took that picture
inside the clinic.

01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:34.721
Baby Boy A was alive.

01:17:46.802 --> 01:17:47.868
This is what we wanted.

01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:04.018
Everything all right?

01:18:23.772 --> 01:18:26.107
Ms. Goodwin, how
many times did you see babies

01:18:26.109 --> 01:18:29.643
that were breathing,
crying, chest moving,

01:18:29.645 --> 01:18:31.312
anything like that?

01:18:31.314 --> 01:18:33.581
How many times would you
say you personally saw that?

01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:35.515
More than 10 times.

01:18:35.517 --> 01:18:38.853
And what, if anything,
did Dr. Gosnell

01:18:38.855 --> 01:18:40.621
do to those babies?

01:18:40.623 --> 01:18:44.060
He would take scissors
and snip the neck.

01:18:45.461 --> 01:18:49.863
Do you remember a specific
baby that he did this to?

01:18:49.865 --> 01:18:51.130
Yes.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.637
For the record,
this is Baby Boy A.

01:18:57.673 --> 01:19:00.840
And were you there on
the night that Baby Boy A

01:19:00.842 --> 01:19:02.609
was born alive?

01:19:02.611 --> 01:19:03.876
Yeah.

01:19:03.878 --> 01:19:04.980
Me and Allison.

01:19:21.064 --> 01:19:22.365
Well, well.

01:19:23.499 --> 01:19:27.270
This baby is big enough to
walk me to the bus stop.

01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:44.585
He put the baby in a tray.

01:19:44.587 --> 01:19:48.656
But when the baby was in
the tray, the baby moved.

01:19:48.658 --> 01:19:50.694
It kind of curled up.

01:19:52.762 --> 01:19:55.362
After Dr. Gosnell put the
baby in the surgical tray,

01:19:55.364 --> 01:19:57.130
what did he do next?

01:19:57.132 --> 01:20:01.170
He put the tray back on the
shelf with the other ones.

01:20:01.937 --> 01:20:03.203
The other ones?

01:20:03.205 --> 01:20:05.005
There were other
babies on the shelf?

01:20:05.007 --> 01:20:06.075
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:14.216 --> 01:20:15.452
Counselor?

01:20:21.923 --> 01:20:23.925
Betty, you like to
take pictures, don't you?

01:20:23.927 --> 01:20:25.158
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:26.794
You take a lot
of pictures, right?

01:20:26.796 --> 01:20:28.261
Pictures of your meals,
pictures of things you see

01:20:28.263 --> 01:20:30.096
on the street, pictures
of your friends?

01:20:30.098 --> 01:20:31.832
Yes.

01:20:31.834 --> 01:20:34.337
Did you ever take a picture
inside Dr. Gosnell's clinic?

01:20:35.037 --> 01:20:36.804
Yes.

01:20:36.806 --> 01:20:38.639
On that particular night, do
you remember taking a picture

01:20:38.641 --> 01:20:41.207
of Baby Boy A, the baby
you saw Dr. Gosnell

01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:42.242
put up on that shelf?

01:20:42.244 --> 01:20:43.678
Objection.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.547
Overruled.

01:20:45.981 --> 01:20:47.948
The witness may answer.

01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:49.383
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:49.385 --> 01:20:51.117
Your Honor, in light
of this new evidence,

01:20:51.119 --> 01:20:52.987
we would like to be
granted the opportunity

01:20:52.989 --> 01:20:53.920
to publish this photograph...

01:20:53.922 --> 01:20:55.255
Objection, Your Honor,

01:20:55.257 --> 01:20:56.490
- this is outrageous!
- People's exhibit C...

01:20:56.492 --> 01:20:58.126
This was not presented
in discovery!

01:20:58.128 --> 01:20:59.594
Exhibit C-5.

01:20:59.596 --> 01:21:01.295
Order, this come
will come to order!

01:21:01.297 --> 01:21:02.862
I declare a short recess.

01:21:02.864 --> 01:21:05.866
I wanna see both counsels
in my chambers now!

01:21:27.856 --> 01:21:29.121
Your Honor,
may the Commonwealth

01:21:29.123 --> 01:21:31.023
publish the exhibit to the jury?

01:21:31.025 --> 01:21:32.461
You may publish.

01:21:33.361 --> 01:21:34.694
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

01:21:34.696 --> 01:21:36.596
this is the photograph
that Betty Goodwin

01:21:36.598 --> 01:21:40.503
took of Baby Boy A on
the night of July 12th.

01:23:27.508 --> 01:23:29.878
Betty, is this the
photograph that you took?

01:23:33.082 --> 01:23:34.380
Yes.

01:23:34.382 --> 01:23:36.452
I just have one
last question for you.

01:23:37.986 --> 01:23:40.554
Why did you decide
to take a photograph

01:23:40.556 --> 01:23:42.492
of this particular baby?

01:23:43.391 --> 01:23:44.925
He was so big.

01:23:46.928 --> 01:23:49.932
He looked like he could have
been somebody's little brother.

01:23:51.668 --> 01:23:54.571
I just thought that there
should be a picture of him,

01:23:56.372 --> 01:23:58.874
to show that he was
here for a little while.

01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:03.810
The Commonwealth
wants you to look

01:24:03.812 --> 01:24:05.979
at a hole in a dirty chair

01:24:05.981 --> 01:24:09.250
and say that means that
that man is a monster.

01:24:09.252 --> 01:24:10.550
It wants you to believe
somebody who says,

01:24:10.552 --> 01:24:12.853
"Oh, I think that
baby moved its arm,"

01:24:12.855 --> 01:24:15.456
and that means that
that man is a killer.

01:24:15.458 --> 01:24:17.860
It's laughable,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:19.093 --> 01:24:21.761
You are not here to
decide whether or not

01:24:21.763 --> 01:24:25.031
Dr. Gosnell ran the cleanest
clinic in Pennsylvania.

01:24:25.033 --> 01:24:26.332
He did not.

01:24:26.334 --> 01:24:27.768
We are not here to
determine whether or not

01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:30.103
abortion is a horrible,
terrible thing

01:24:30.105 --> 01:24:31.741
to have to look at, it is.

01:24:32.574 --> 01:24:34.340
We are here to
determine whether or not

01:24:34.342 --> 01:24:36.710
the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania has proved

01:24:36.712 --> 01:24:39.412
that this fine man, who
has served his community

01:24:39.414 --> 01:24:42.351
for 30 years,
providing services...

01:25:15.851 --> 01:25:21.056
Ladies and gentlemen, Kermit
Gosnell snipped the spine

01:25:21.556 --> 01:25:22.658
of this baby

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.425
and hundreds, maybe
even thousands

01:25:26.427 --> 01:25:28.897
of other babies just like him,

01:25:29.832 --> 01:25:32.769
born alive and then killed.

01:25:34.770 --> 01:25:36.939
Yes, he did some
legal abortions.

01:25:37.672 --> 01:25:39.907
Yes, his clinic was filthy.

01:25:39.909 --> 01:25:43.513
Yes, he had separate rooms for
white women and black women.

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.516
But, this case is
not about that.

01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:51.084
This case is about
Karnamaya Mongar.

01:25:51.086 --> 01:25:56.324
This case is about that baby
and countless other babies

01:25:57.426 --> 01:26:00.029
that Dr. Gosnell murdered
after they were born.

01:26:04.098 --> 01:26:06.535
This baby would be
four years old today.

01:26:36.531 --> 01:26:37.699
Okay, thanks.

01:26:47.409 --> 01:26:50.445
Will the defendant and
the attorneys please rise?

01:26:52.413 --> 01:26:55.749
Mr. Foreman, have the
jurors reached a verdict?

01:26:55.751 --> 01:26:57.587
Yes, Your Honor, we have.

01:26:58.854 --> 01:27:00.519
To the charge of
criminal homicide

01:27:00.521 --> 01:27:03.057
in the death of
Baby E, how say you?

01:27:03.059 --> 01:27:04.092
Not guilty.

01:27:04.994 --> 01:27:06.760
What?

01:27:06.762 --> 01:27:07.827
On the charge of murder
in the third degree,

01:27:07.829 --> 01:27:09.599
victim Mongar, how say you?

01:27:10.399 --> 01:27:11.700
Not guilty.

01:27:14.869 --> 01:27:16.469
To the charge of
first degree murder,

01:27:16.471 --> 01:27:18.574
Baby A, how say you?

01:27:20.508 --> 01:27:21.876
Guilty.

01:27:24.879 --> 01:27:28.618
To the charge of first degree
murder, Baby C, how say you?

01:27:29.251 --> 01:27:30.153
Guilty.

01:27:32.454 --> 01:27:36.523
To the charge of first degree
murder, Baby D, how say you?

01:27:36.525 --> 01:27:37.724
Guilty.

01:27:40.628 --> 01:27:42.062
Order!

01:27:44.266 --> 01:27:45.902
Order in the court.

01:27:47.269 --> 01:27:48.137
Order!

01:28:08.524 --> 01:28:11.191
But this was
not a case about abortion.

01:28:11.193 --> 01:28:13.260
In the end, this was
not a case about abortion,

01:28:13.262 --> 01:28:14.894
this was a case about a doctor...

01:28:14.896 --> 01:28:16.296
What did I tell you?

01:28:16.298 --> 01:28:18.633
This is not a case
about abortion.

01:28:19.534 --> 01:28:21.503
Now I'm gonna do you a solid.

01:28:22.904 --> 01:28:25.005
Anyone from the media
that would like to speak

01:28:25.007 --> 01:28:27.643
to the DA's office,
please gather round.

01:28:29.645 --> 01:28:32.178
The Commonwealth would
like to thank the jury

01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.313
for their hard work.

01:28:33.315 --> 01:28:34.247
Mollie.

01:28:34.249 --> 01:28:35.447
Congratulations.

01:28:35.449 --> 01:28:36.817
Oh, I hate to admit this,

01:28:36.819 --> 01:28:39.252
but we could not have
done this without you.

01:28:39.254 --> 01:28:40.122
It's true.

01:28:41.323 --> 01:28:42.755
Why did you help?

01:28:42.757 --> 01:28:44.624
I didn't help, I'm a reporter.

01:28:44.626 --> 01:28:46.359
I'm just interested
in the truth.

01:28:46.361 --> 01:28:48.327
If the truth doesn't
match what I believe,

01:28:48.329 --> 01:28:50.063
I don't change the truth.

01:28:50.065 --> 01:28:50.967
See you around.

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:55.102
Well, fellas, I
have five kids to feed.

01:28:55.104 --> 01:28:56.071
See you tomorrow.

01:28:59.641 --> 01:29:01.140
There we go.

01:29:01.142 --> 01:29:02.843
You ready to ride
off into the sunset?

01:29:02.845 --> 01:29:04.814
Yeah, right.

01:29:11.486 --> 01:29:12.654
Excuse me!

01:29:13.855 --> 01:29:15.321
Ms. McGuire.

01:29:15.323 --> 01:29:16.258
You remember me?

01:29:17.159 --> 01:29:20.059
Of course, Ms. Brown,
from the grand jury.

01:29:20.061 --> 01:29:22.562
I have somebody
I'd like you to meet.

01:29:22.564 --> 01:29:23.798
This is Gracie.

01:29:24.999 --> 01:29:27.002
My baby started
kindergarten today.

01:29:33.309 --> 01:29:35.241
Hi, Gracie!

01:29:35.243 --> 01:29:36.509
Hi.

01:29:36.511 --> 01:29:37.580
I'm Lexi!

01:29:38.379 --> 01:29:40.315
It's so nice to meet you.

01:33:03.918 --> 01:33:08.918
