09:45.236 --> 09:46.498
Oh, you in trouble now!

09:46.542 --> 09:48.239
-You in trouble now!
-Dude, fuck you!

09:48.283 --> 09:49.676
Now, fucking listen!

09:49.719 --> 09:51.416
There ain't no raft!
It ain't gonna happen!

09:51.460 --> 09:53.418
-But Tuna's fucking gone,
asshole!
-No!

09:53.462 --> 09:55.290
I'm the new Tuna!
I'm the new Tuna!

09:55.333 --> 09:57.161
Except I'm not gonna use
that wack name!

09:57.205 --> 09:59.207
You're
a fucking sick motherfucker,

09:59.250 --> 10:00.600
-you know that?
-I'm a smart motherfucker.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.297
That's what's up.
That's what's up.

10:02.340 --> 10:05.430
You ain't going anywhere,
not today, not never!

10:05.474 --> 10:08.346
Fucking pool time, baby!
[whoops]

10:08.390 --> 10:10.435
Fuck you!

10:13.090 --> 10:15.310
[door slams]

10:26.190 --> 10:28.453
[faint P.A. announcement]

10:39.160 --> 10:41.118
GUARD:
On the gate.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.381
[door buzzes]

10:51.215 --> 10:53.174
You look like shit.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.176
Thanks. So do you.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.830
You're here early.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.483
Yeah, I needed to see you.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.790
But you didn't need to answer
your phone when I called?

11:00.834 --> 11:02.531
What the hell happened to you?

11:02.574 --> 11:05.055
Actually, I just-- I just met
a friend of yours.

11:05.099 --> 11:08.102
Uh, outside in the parking lot.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.930
Mid-50s, pigtails.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.323
Came at me like a demon toddler.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.848
I'm still seeing blurry
out of this eye.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.067
[chuckles]

11:17.111 --> 11:19.069
You got your ass whipped
by Patty?

11:19.113 --> 11:20.462
[laughing]:
That's hilarious.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.072
Who the hell is Patty?

11:22.116 --> 11:23.683
My girlfriend.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.467
-Girlfriend?
-Or, you know,

11:25.510 --> 11:27.774
sugar mama, to be more precise.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.471
I didn't know you had
a girlfriend.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.865
-I didn't know you wore a weave.
-I'm a woman of mystery.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.301
Hmm. Guess I am, too.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.564
Oh, yeah.
Starting to figure that out.

11:36.521 --> 11:39.133
So, you have
a deranged sugar mama.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.265
That's fascinating.

11:41.309 --> 11:45.139
Any other secrets
that you'd like to share?

11:45.182 --> 11:46.618
No.

11:46.662 --> 11:49.665
-No? Nothing?
-Where have you been?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.362
-I asked you first.
-No, where have you been?

11:51.406 --> 11:52.973
Where have you been? Where have
you been? Where have you been!

11:53.016 --> 11:54.757
GUARD:
Hey!

11:54.801 --> 11:56.193
BETH:
You done?

11:56.237 --> 11:57.760
I'm not a fucking toy.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.631
I mean, you can't just
leave me hanging like that.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.416
I thought you'd given up on me.

12:01.459 --> 12:02.939
And then I thought
you were dead.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.506
I was actually worried
about your raggedy ass.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.203
But it turns out
this whole time

12:06.247 --> 12:07.552
you've been at the club.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.904
What are you doing, Beth?

12:10.947 --> 12:13.123
Are you even writing this story?
'Cause you came in here

12:13.167 --> 12:15.343
guns blazing,
ready to be Captain Save-A-Ho.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.345
Well, then cape up, bitch.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.477
Ticky-tock.

12:19.521 --> 12:23.960
I went out with Allegra,
Simone and Chevy.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.484
-Why?
-For your story.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.269
Then you were wasting your time.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.619
Oh, no. It was really helpful,
talking to your friends.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.447
-They had a lot to say.
-Well, that's weird,

12:32.490 --> 12:35.842
'cause they haven't said a peep
to me in years.

12:35.885 --> 12:38.105
And as far as I know,
Allegra, Simone and Chevy,

12:38.148 --> 12:40.063
those bitches
didn't kill Wallace.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.283
So you don't need to be spending
your Friday nights

12:42.326 --> 12:43.719
out in the club with them

12:43.763 --> 12:46.287
in a skirt
that's a decade too short.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.812
[whispers]:
Chevy told me everything.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.466
[whispers]:
What'd she tell you?

12:51.509 --> 12:53.598
That she was in love with me?

12:53.642 --> 12:55.992
'Cause that's true. She was.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.647
Or that she never forgave me
for dating Wallace?

12:58.690 --> 13:00.301
[chuckles]:
You know...

13:00.344 --> 13:03.260
Chevy and I were close, and
then somewhere along the line

13:03.304 --> 13:05.175
she wanted me to be
her girlfriend and sister

13:05.219 --> 13:07.874
and mom all wrapped up into one,
and I couldn't be that.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.963
Shit, I barely had a mom myself.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.703
It's funny you should say that.

13:11.747 --> 13:15.098
Do you remember what's across
the street from the Percolator?

13:15.142 --> 13:16.708
[clears throat]

13:17.753 --> 13:20.234
Some janky liquor store?

13:20.277 --> 13:21.713
No. No.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.237
Other side.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.197
The Caribbean Corner.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.070
[sighs]

13:31.593 --> 13:33.290
So you met Yvette.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.945
Oh, so you do know
your mom's in Denver.

13:35.989 --> 13:36.903
Cool.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.861
-All right, listen...
-No. No.

13:38.905 --> 13:42.691
You said to me she was deported
when you were 14.

13:42.734 --> 13:47.522
You had me weeping on your bed,
feeling so, so sorry for you.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.959
The-the quilt
and the abandonment...

13:50.003 --> 13:51.656
Guyana?

13:51.700 --> 13:53.484
I mean, great choice of country,
by the way.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.660
Very specific.
But this whole time

13:55.704 --> 13:58.141
she's been slinging patties
at the fucking Caribbean Corner?

13:58.185 --> 13:59.664
-It wasn't like that.
-No?

13:59.708 --> 14:01.188
-It...
-What was it like?

14:01.231 --> 14:02.450
How are you gonna spin this

14:02.493 --> 14:04.147
so you don't come off
like a big fat liar?

14:04.191 --> 14:06.280
It-it wasn't a lie, exactly.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.064
Well, what was it, exactly?

14:08.108 --> 14:10.675
An... emotional truth.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.895
[whispers]:
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

14:12.939 --> 14:17.334
So what, a lie isn't a lie as
long as it's emotionally true?

14:17.378 --> 14:19.162
You should get a trophy
for that.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.772
GUARD [in distance]:
Let's keep it moving, inmates!

14:20.816 --> 14:23.906
Some things are true
in my heart, okay?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.038
No, not okay.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.083
Either a mom is deported
or she isn't.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.432
Yours wasn't!

14:28.476 --> 14:29.825
She always was about to be,

14:29.869 --> 14:31.609
-or thought she was.
-[whispers]: Oh, my God.

14:31.653 --> 14:34.395
I mean, what, do you think
this country elects Black people

14:34.438 --> 14:35.787
from Guyana?

14:35.831 --> 14:37.267
I mean, we were always waiting
for a visa,

14:37.311 --> 14:38.616
then waiting
for the visa to renew,

14:38.660 --> 14:39.922
then waiting for a green card,

14:39.966 --> 14:41.881
then waiting
for the green card to renew.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.144
And it could all get overturned
because of something that I did.

14:44.187 --> 14:48.539
If I got a detention or if I
lifted a tube top from a store

14:48.583 --> 14:50.846
or got caught
fucking jaywalking.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.067
And she'd go, "What, you
trying to get me thrown out,

14:54.110 --> 14:56.417
"then see how much
you like living on the streets

14:56.460 --> 14:58.810
-like a harlot."
-So you didn't like her rules.

14:58.854 --> 14:59.942
Boo-hoo.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.813
Fuck you, Malibu.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.990
You're so stuck
in your own mind,

15:04.033 --> 15:05.339
you don't even realize

15:05.382 --> 15:07.732
some people have to lie
just to survive.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.735
There are moms all over
the world who don't give a shit.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.476
It doesn't mean
we-we lie about it

15:12.520 --> 15:14.217
or use it as a convenient excuse

15:14.261 --> 15:16.480
every chance we get.

15:18.047 --> 15:21.529
You know, Yvette was a
scared person who clung to God.

15:25.098 --> 15:28.884
If I so much as looked at a guy,
she thought I'd get pregnant.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.931
And when I started going out,

15:31.974 --> 15:34.585
she either locked me in the
house or locked me out of it.

15:34.629 --> 15:35.891
My own mom.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.241
And I'd have to sleep
in the playground

15:38.285 --> 15:40.852
next to this schizo guy
who would climb to the top

15:40.896 --> 15:43.072
where there's a pirate ship

15:43.116 --> 15:45.422
and yell down
to "batten the hatches."

15:45.466 --> 15:47.381
It was fucked up.

15:48.164 --> 15:51.863
So one night I went home, and
I screamed through the window

15:51.907 --> 15:55.302
that I was gonna leave for good
if she didn't want me.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.173
You know what she said?

15:57.217 --> 15:58.870
She said, "Go.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.003
"This is a good house
for good people,

16:01.047 --> 16:04.789
and there's no room for
shameless Jezebels like you."

16:06.052 --> 16:08.706
So I said, "The Holy Spirit
can suck my dick."

16:08.750 --> 16:11.971
She said, "Don't you ever
come back," and I didn't, ever.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.624
I was 14.

16:13.668 --> 16:17.063
So yeah, I say she got deported.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.891
It's easier to accept
than the truth.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.677
And she chose not to come
to my trial.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.811
Not to come visit me here.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.509
Not to raise my daughter.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.554
Somebody else is doing that.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.556
I might not even see my child,

16:32.600 --> 16:34.906
my own baby, because of her.

16:37.257 --> 16:39.215
And you don't even believe me.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.783
-[Beth sighs]
-Hmm?

16:41.826 --> 16:43.828
I don't know what to believe.

16:43.872 --> 16:47.180
So you think
just because I lied about Yvette

16:47.223 --> 16:49.008
that I'm a killer?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.835
-Is that where we're at?
-No,

16:50.879 --> 16:52.750
because it's not just Yvette.

16:52.794 --> 16:56.058
-I saw the texts to Chevy.
-What texts?

16:56.102 --> 16:57.320
-Please don't bullshit me.
-No, I'm not.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.235
-What texts?
-Okay, fine.

16:59.279 --> 17:00.584
The texts where you said,

17:00.628 --> 17:02.238
"Would you help me kill
my husband?"

17:02.282 --> 17:05.589
And she said, "No,"
and you said, "All right, okay,

17:05.633 --> 17:08.114
I'm cool doing murder
by myself."

17:09.289 --> 17:11.900
Yeah, those texts.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.826
WYATT:
Yo, how many other crews
Tuna got?

17:24.869 --> 17:29.309
Us, obviously, Cortez bunch...

17:29.352 --> 17:31.963
Grand J, Salt Lake...

17:32.007 --> 17:36.142
Who else is there?
What's the other one?

17:36.185 --> 17:37.708
Yuma!

17:37.752 --> 17:39.493
That's what's up. Never liked
them little bitches.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.234
[phone ringing]

17:41.277 --> 17:43.540
-BETH: Hey, it's Beth.
Leave a message.
-[beep]

17:43.584 --> 17:47.327
Hey, Beth, uh, it's George.
Um...

17:48.154 --> 17:50.721
-Listen, um...
-WYATT: Fuck those other crews.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.811
I'm calling to ask you
to please

17:53.855 --> 17:55.117
delete those texts

17:55.161 --> 17:56.901
-that I sent you.
-I'm Tuna now, bitches.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.295
-'Bout to tune you out.
-You know the ones, the...

17:59.339 --> 18:00.557
WYATT:
Blam! Blam!

18:00.601 --> 18:03.038
You know the ones.
The ones of my...

18:03.082 --> 18:04.735
WYATT:
Got Tuna 2.0 right here.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.041
-...of my dick.
-Yo, Spanky,

18:06.085 --> 18:07.825
who do you think
we should hit up first?

18:07.869 --> 18:09.697
Too many of them Grand J
fuckers.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.177
Probably should be Yuma.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.179
Yeah, Yuma.

18:13.222 --> 18:16.443
Uh, I just want you to know
that I don't...

18:16.486 --> 18:18.314
I don't send pictures like that

18:18.358 --> 18:21.274
to just anyone.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.884
Okay?

18:22.927 --> 18:27.671
For me to show you
what I showed you, it...

18:27.715 --> 18:31.153
it means something.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.285
To me, at least.

18:32.328 --> 18:33.677
WYATT:
You want to make sure to pack

18:33.721 --> 18:34.722
a short-sleeve velour
track suit.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.637
Arizona's hot as hell.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.856
Let's go.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.250
Uh, listen, I'm headed to Yuma
for a few days,

18:41.294 --> 18:43.687
but, um...

18:43.731 --> 18:47.082
when I get back,
I-I'd really like to see you.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.258
Aw, fuck me.

18:49.302 --> 18:52.218
All right. Bye.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.535
[gunshot]

19:05.579 --> 19:08.190
Oh, shit! Goddamn!

19:09.104 --> 19:10.497
Aw, man, wasted money on a pool.

19:10.540 --> 19:11.498
Fuckin'...

19:11.541 --> 19:14.022
It's all good.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.371
My finger just slipped.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.981
GEORGE:
Goddamn.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.985
I really believed
in my heart

19:21.029 --> 19:23.205
that you were innocent.

19:23.249 --> 19:27.078
But this whole time,
it wasyou.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.950
I fought for you.

19:28.993 --> 19:32.171
I-I fell into a frozen lake
at gunpoint for you.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.956
My whole life has gone
to shit because of you.

19:34.999 --> 19:38.220
You're just gonna sit there
and keep lying to me?

19:38.264 --> 19:42.485
And the worst part is, God,
I thought we were friends.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.574
What?

19:44.618 --> 19:46.924
Yeah. I trusted you.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.274
I opened up to you.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.101
You used me,
just like you're using

19:50.145 --> 19:52.408
that-that sad woman Patty.

19:52.452 --> 19:55.106
Oh, shit.
[laughs]

19:55.150 --> 19:56.499
What?

19:56.543 --> 19:58.632
That's good.

19:58.675 --> 20:01.635
Why are you laughing?
Stop laughing.

20:03.593 --> 20:06.117
'Cause I figured you out.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.989
I used to think you loved
playing the hero,

20:08.032 --> 20:10.861
but actually, you're horny
for being the victim.

20:10.905 --> 20:13.255
It's always somebody else's
fault your life is shit.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.214
Okay, you're de--
You're deflecting.

20:15.257 --> 20:19.261
Ah, your mom, your husband,
your baby-faced boss.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.263
Now it's my turn.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.309
Are you really
so self-absorbed that you think

20:23.352 --> 20:26.877
there's some global conspiracy
to ruin your life?

20:26.921 --> 20:29.271
Like that many people
actually care.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.359
You killed him.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.274
And, hey, I-I get it.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.494
Maybe if somebody was
abusing me,

20:34.537 --> 20:36.452
then I would have
killed them, too.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.585
I just--

20:38.628 --> 20:41.588
I wish you would
admit it, for your sake.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.111
No, I won't do that.

20:43.154 --> 20:45.809
You want me to be guilty
so you don't have to admit

20:45.853 --> 20:48.029
that you failed at yet
another thing.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.422
So you can say you solved it.

20:49.465 --> 20:50.945
'Cause you thought it was
that violent Black woman

20:50.988 --> 20:53.252
the whole time, but it wasn't.
Sorry.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.079
I hired you to prove
my innocence,

20:55.123 --> 20:56.820
and you failed spectacularly.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.474
No, I did my job.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.303
I followed the leads,
I worked all the sources.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.479
I tried my hardest
to protect you from a system

21:03.523 --> 21:04.915
that totally failed you.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.309
But you sent me
on a fool's errand.

21:07.353 --> 21:10.312
And you jeopardized my career
in the process.

21:10.356 --> 21:13.402
How could I jeopardize something
that barely exists?

21:13.446 --> 21:17.058
Oh, wow. Okay.

21:17.101 --> 21:19.495
-I think we're done here.
-No, no, no, no, no.
Not yet.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.932
Deep down under
your liberal white woman,

21:21.976 --> 21:24.195
"I'm in it for
the right reasons" bullshit,

21:24.239 --> 21:27.590
you look at me, and you see
a guilty person.

21:27.634 --> 21:30.332
As soon as you got the chance
to do that, you did.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.203
How could we be friends?

21:32.247 --> 21:34.031
How could we possibly be friends

21:34.075 --> 21:35.685
if you haven't been
a good friend to me;

21:35.729 --> 21:38.079
if this is how you treat me?

21:41.343 --> 21:44.694
You're right,
I wanted to kill him.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.566
Wallace?

21:46.609 --> 21:47.871
No, the other dead white guy.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.831
[exhales sharply]
Okay.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.354
You know, when I met him,
he had this way of

21:52.398 --> 21:54.356
making you feel like
anything was possible.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.924
That he was invincible,
fearless,

21:56.967 --> 21:59.970
a golden child of God.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.537
But that was all hype.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.365
Anything wasn't possible.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.628
The world just kept
shitting on him

22:05.672 --> 22:07.195
and knocking him down.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.893
He got meaner,
turning around

22:09.937 --> 22:12.026
and shitting on the people
around him.

22:12.069 --> 22:14.245
Wyatt, George, me.

22:14.289 --> 22:16.073
Especially me.

22:16.117 --> 22:20.251
I had a front-row seat
to his insecurity, to his fear.

22:20.295 --> 22:21.905
To all the things
he hated about himself,

22:21.949 --> 22:23.994
and he hated me for that.

22:24.038 --> 22:28.521
And when it got really bad,
like, really bad,

22:28.564 --> 22:31.480
I started losing it.

22:31.524 --> 22:35.266
Kept thinking about killing him.

22:36.224 --> 22:39.358
And at first, it terrified me,

22:39.401 --> 22:42.709
like, what the fuck was going on
in my head.

22:42.752 --> 22:45.407
But then I grew to like it.

22:45.451 --> 22:49.933
In the dreams I...
thought about stabbing him,

22:49.977 --> 22:52.458
poisoning him,
then pushing him

22:52.501 --> 22:54.460
down an elevator shaft.

22:54.503 --> 22:56.462
But then, at the end
of the dreams,

22:56.505 --> 23:00.074
I felt happy, free.

23:00.117 --> 23:04.470
So, yeah, I texted Chevy

23:04.513 --> 23:07.560
to see if she could
make my dreams a reality.

23:07.603 --> 23:10.214
But before I could
go through with it,

23:10.258 --> 23:13.783
I found out I was gonna
have a baby.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.090
I was gonna be a mom.

23:16.133 --> 23:19.789
And suddenly,
I couldn't kill him.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.965
I couldn't risk
getting locked up.

23:22.009 --> 23:24.664
That's hilarious, right?

23:24.707 --> 23:27.928
But I knew what it was like
to lose a mother,

23:27.971 --> 23:30.670
and I didn't want
to put my daughter

23:30.713 --> 23:32.323
through the same thing.

23:32.367 --> 23:35.196
And I thought you,
of all people, would get it.

23:35.239 --> 23:38.329
But maybe you don't.

23:38.373 --> 23:42.421
Maybe you're so unloved,
you can't even imagine

23:42.464 --> 23:45.424
someone making a decision
like that for someone else.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.693
I didn't kill Wallace

23:53.736 --> 23:57.392
because I love Laila.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.482
You know,

24:00.526 --> 24:04.138
sometimes I think the closest
I'll get to holding her

24:04.181 --> 24:07.228
is looking at this.

24:09.143 --> 24:13.060
Oh, goddamn it, I'm sorry, Toni.

24:13.103 --> 24:17.064
I'm sorry. Sorry.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.372
That, uh...
[clears throat]

24:21.416 --> 24:24.506
-That isn't Laila.
-What?

24:24.550 --> 24:27.161
On your-- On your arm.

24:27.204 --> 24:30.164
[sniffles] It's not her.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.079
What are you saying?

24:32.122 --> 24:35.212
It's my niece.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.128
Her name is Ellie.

24:38.172 --> 24:41.480
-Your niece Ellie?
-You were--

24:41.523 --> 24:43.743
You were making a mistake
going with Tessa,

24:43.786 --> 24:45.092
and I couldn't let that happen.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.528
And I knew I could find
the real Laila

24:46.572 --> 24:47.790
with just a little bit
more time.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.400
Where's my daughter?!

24:49.444 --> 24:51.577
Wh-What the fuck are you
telling me right now?

24:51.620 --> 24:54.275
No, no. I found her. I promise
you, I found her. I swear I did.

24:54.318 --> 24:55.755
-The girl on the phone?
-Yes.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.104
That's her. That's Laila.

24:57.147 --> 24:58.671
And everything I told you
about her

24:58.714 --> 25:01.195
and her foster family,
all that is true.

25:01.238 --> 25:03.850
It's just, you know,
I needed a minute,

25:03.893 --> 25:05.460
and I couldn't let you
slip away.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.418
-Just shut up!
-Plimpton!

25:07.462 --> 25:10.465
-[growls]
-I can still find Wallace's
killer, I promise you.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.988
-I promise.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.120
You have lost the right
to talk to me.

25:13.163 --> 25:14.556
You don't have that anymore.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.689
And what, you want me
to pat you on the head

25:16.732 --> 25:18.517
and tell you it's gonna be okay?
It's not okay.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.084
What you did is not okay.
What you're doing is not okay.

25:21.128 --> 25:23.391
You think you're better than
the people who put me in here?

25:23.434 --> 25:25.175
At least they didn't pretend
to be the good guy.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.960
Toni, I'm gonna make this right,
I promise.

25:27.003 --> 25:28.265
No, no, no, no, no.

25:28.309 --> 25:29.528
Go find yourself
somebody else to save.

25:29.571 --> 25:30.964
You better get me
the fuck out of here

25:31.007 --> 25:33.314
-before I hit this woman.
