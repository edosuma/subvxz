00:00.531 --> 00:01.769
Previously on Z Nation.

00:01.869 --> 00:04.137
A bullet to the heart will reveal the truth.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.872
No!

00:09.777 --> 00:11.445
I love you.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.479
I love you too.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.147
Warren, we have to go.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.148
No! We have to go now.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.083
We can't let him turn.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.952
We have to give him mercy!

00:41.409 --> 00:42.909
Good morning, people.

00:42.944 --> 00:45.111
Welcome to the third day of the sixth month

00:45.146 --> 00:47.447
of the year 03 A.Z.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.683
If you're listening to this,
it means you're still alive.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.785
So congratulations.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.320
Or condolences.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.155
You know, whatever.

00:55.456 --> 00:59.059
If you're noticing more despair
in my voice than usual today,

00:59.093 --> 01:01.728
it's because we lost someone special.

01:01.762 --> 01:05.197
I know, we lose people all the time.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.534
Getting your face chewed
off by a Z is more common

01:07.568 --> 01:09.736
than making it to your next birthday.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.505
But this guy...

01:13.274 --> 01:15.509
This one's worth mentioning.

01:15.543 --> 01:19.713
Charles Garnett, First Sergeant,
Army National Guard Reservist,

01:19.747 --> 01:24.484
was an honest to God,
real life, actual good guy.

01:24.519 --> 01:27.954
He fought for other people,
not just for his own survival.

01:27.989 --> 01:30.357
And he did something that's
pretty much impossible

01:30.391 --> 01:31.758
these days.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.493
He gave people hope.

01:34.996 --> 01:37.030
Remember hope?

01:37.064 --> 01:39.065
Remember thinking that we might actually

01:39.100 --> 01:41.434
come out on the other side of this thing?

01:41.469 --> 01:43.370
Yeah. That.

01:43.404 --> 01:47.874
Sergeant Garnett died trying
to give us a reason to hope.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.744
And for that...

01:54.148 --> 01:56.683
Sergeant Charles Garnett.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.386
On behalf of a grateful nation,

01:59.420 --> 02:01.855
or whatever the hell we are now,

02:02.823 --> 02:04.858
we salute you.

02:36.924 --> 02:37.757
Radiator?

02:37.792 --> 02:39.559
Yeah.

02:39.594 --> 02:40.560
Fixable?

02:40.595 --> 02:41.962
Don't know.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.297
Gee, if we only had a mechanic.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.932
You got to let her deal, man.

02:45.967 --> 02:47.634
She's got that post-traumatic stress.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.603
She's got post-traumatic stress?

02:49.637 --> 02:52.806
The whole world's got post-traumatic stress.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.841
Actually there isn't anything post about it.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.077
We all got plain ol' present tense,

02:57.111 --> 02:59.613
all traumatic, all stress all the time.

02:59.814 --> 03:01.982
What makes her so special?

03:03.417 --> 03:06.453
Hey. Wake up. Hey.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.924
No, you can't just check out.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.926
We got a job to do.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.601
And I am running out of time.

03:21.636 --> 03:24.304
And California is still
2,000 miles of bad road away.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.873
And we are <i> not</i> gonna make it without you.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.643
Cuz it's not like they're gonna follow me

03:29.677 --> 03:32.212
or the old man or the
wonder twins out there.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.047
Hey.

03:46.394 --> 03:49.029
All right, Addy and I will scout up ahead.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.630
See if we can get some help.

03:50.665 --> 03:51.698
We will?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.566
Yeah.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.636
Yeah, I dunno, guys.
I think we should stick together.

03:56.671 --> 03:57.904
No, Doc. Don't worry.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.873
We're just gonna scout ahead and
circle back around and find you.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.775
I mean it's not like you're
getting far in the truck.

04:01.809 --> 04:02.742
Come on, Addy.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.250
I can't believe I'm saying this, but

04:10.284 --> 04:12.919
what if Warren doesn't snap out of it?

04:13.554 --> 04:15.722
She's not giving up.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.290
All right, well

04:17.324 --> 04:19.759
we can't just sit here
and wait for help to come.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.728
I mean we got to do something.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.930
Okay.

04:33.174 --> 04:35.942
I found the leak in the radiator hose.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.644
Taped it up a little bit, but

04:37.678 --> 04:41.347
we're not going anywhere unless
we get some water in there.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.757
I get thirsty.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.359
We all get thirsty.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.232
I'll drive.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.434
Knock yourself out, kid.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.673
Whoa! Whoa!

05:06.707 --> 05:08.975
Easy there, kid! Easy!

05:09.009 --> 05:10.844
Who taught you how to drive?

05:10.878 --> 05:11.911
Ahhh...

05:11.946 --> 05:13.313
no one.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.783
Hands on the ten and the two.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.587
And easy on the gas.

05:50.985 --> 05:52.819
Nothin' out here.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.922
No people, no gas, not even Zs.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.424
Nah, we got to go back.

05:58.993 --> 06:00.360
There is no help out here.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.796
There's no help back there either.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.133
We have to go back, Mack.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.435
We have a mission.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.037
We made a promise.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.772
No, we didn't.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.007
We never did.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.543
Addy, the only promise we
ever made was to each other.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.111
To stay alive.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.412
Look, yeah, okay.

06:19.446 --> 06:23.550
Maybe we didn't say the words
and we didn't sign an oath. But

06:24.084 --> 06:25.518
we all stand for each other.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.120
We don't leave each other behind.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.722
Garnett came back for me when
those cannibals kidnapped me.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.891
And now you want to leave Warren?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.595
She needs us.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.997
They all need us.

06:38.032 --> 06:39.766
I just think

06:40.768 --> 06:43.803
maybe we have a better chance on our own.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.239
Like in the beginning.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.208
Mmm-hmmm.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.344
So how long?

06:52.646 --> 06:53.513
What?

06:54.682 --> 06:56.282
How long before you think
that you have a better chance

06:56.317 --> 06:57.884
on your own?

06:59.653 --> 07:01.387
Addy. Whoa.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.956
Hey.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.225
I came back for you.

07:05.259 --> 07:05.758
Hmmm?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.660
The cannibals.

07:07.695 --> 07:11.598
I came back for you.
I'll always come back for you.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.771
You know me.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.774
I'm not so sure anymore.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.877
About anything.

07:24.879 --> 07:25.945
All right.

07:28.682 --> 07:29.883
We'll go back.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.854
Okay.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.961
Go right.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.329
Why right?

07:43.697 --> 07:45.732
Why not?

07:52.706 --> 07:53.606
No Zs.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.375
That's a good sign.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.413
Getting interesting.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.918
Liquor! Now you're talking.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.420
Murphy, we're gonna have to
let you navigate more often.

08:08.555 --> 08:11.557
Congratulations, son.
You're now the designated driver.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.092
What's that mean?

08:13.460 --> 08:14.761
It means step on it!

08:38.919 --> 08:42.188
I've never
seen so many in one place.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.157
So much for going back.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.698
<i> ♪ Have mercy... ♪</i>

Stop.

09:11.085 --> 09:12.885
Y'all armed?

09:13.754 --> 09:15.989
Obviously.

09:18.092 --> 09:21.027
Good. We don't have time to babysit anyone.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.573
Guns and liquor.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.308
What could go wrong?

09:35.476 --> 09:37.210
Did anyone say liquor?

09:38.112 --> 09:39.846
Enjoy the show fellas.

09:42.216 --> 09:45.852
Welcome to S&S Limited,
the finest gun show in the west.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.220
Entry fee is seven.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.354
Seven what?

09:48.389 --> 09:49.188
Bullets.

09:49.223 --> 09:50.390
Oxy.

09:50.424 --> 09:54.794
Grams of whatever DIY super
fun time substance you got.

09:54.828 --> 09:58.131
Well I think I got some
crystal back in the truck.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.199
It's the good stuff too. Yeah.

10:00.234 --> 10:04.270
Back off with the toilet bowl cleanser meth.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.739
We only take that genuine

10:06.774 --> 10:10.443
vein splittin' take you right
out of this beautiful apocalypse

10:10.477 --> 10:12.078
and into a hell-hole meth.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.781
Well slap my ass and call me Sally

10:14.815 --> 10:16.949
if it ain't Sketchy McClain.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.619
How'd you get way out here?

10:19.653 --> 10:22.255
We traded our way up in the world.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.356
Here.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.958
You see zombies,
they move in mysterious ways.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.594
We were on our last legs
when we came upon this

10:28.629 --> 10:30.763
truckload of sweet weaponry under attack.

10:30.798 --> 10:33.132
We had to give the former owners mercy.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.067
And in return,

10:34.101 --> 10:36.202
they gave us this wonderful vehicle with

10:36.236 --> 10:39.105
enough gas to get us here to Kansas.

10:39.139 --> 10:39.906
Oh.

10:39.940 --> 10:40.773
Hey, Skeezy!

10:40.808 --> 10:42.642
Look what the living dead dragged in!

10:42.676 --> 10:44.010
Doc!

10:44.044 --> 10:49.615
I heard you were toast back at Camp Blue Sky!

10:49.650 --> 10:51.350
Don't just stand there.
Get your ass in here.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.052
We need another sucker.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.520
Bite me, Skeezy.

10:54.555 --> 10:57.757
Hey, I got to show you the
new and improved Z-Whacker.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.194
Hey, speaking of Z-Whacker

11:01.228 --> 11:03.796
what happened to the girl you were with?
Did she...

11:03.831 --> 11:05.932
No, man. We're still traveling together.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.633
They went ahead looking for help.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.602
Kinda thought they'd end up here.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.971
No, haven't seen them.

11:12.206 --> 11:13.940
And I'm pretty sure I'd notice.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.909
Here we've got our latest innovations

11:16.944 --> 11:19.078
in zombie fighting technology.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.447
Small arms. Hot potato.

11:21.482 --> 11:22.915
Siege weapons.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.817
Brain-obliterators.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.085
You name it, we got it.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.555
Just sit back, relax,
and forget about the apocalypse.

11:29.590 --> 11:31.224
Aren't you worried about the Zs?

11:31.258 --> 11:32.158
Look around.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.960
We're in the middle of nowhere Kansas.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.095
We're surrounded by hundreds of square miles

11:36.130 --> 11:38.297
of nothing but fallow farmlands.

11:38.332 --> 11:40.399
There's no Zs here. Nothing for them to eat.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.401
They've all moved on to the big cities.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.036
Don't you worry.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.905
I'll protect you.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.677
Yeah, but anyway,
if one were to come amble by,

11:51.712 --> 11:54.647
to say we're prepared is an understatement,
right? Uh,

11:54.681 --> 11:56.649
over there is the FU-Bar.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.619
Home to the finest and
probably actually the only

11:59.653 --> 12:02.655
corn whiskey and moonshine
between here and the Miss...

12:02.689 --> 12:05.324
Whoa. Somebody's thirsty.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.127
Listen man, we need a new vehicle.

12:08.162 --> 12:11.197
Ours is dying a slow death.
You think you could help us out?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.598
You know, for old time's sake?

12:12.633 --> 12:14.200
No can do, my friend.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.669
I'm an entrepreneur, not a philanthropist.

12:16.703 --> 12:17.803
But

12:17.838 --> 12:20.006
there might be a way you can help yourself.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.543
Our first annual live
zombie shooting contest.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.877
What's the prize?

12:24.912 --> 12:27.547
Hey, Vernon.
Show our friends here first prize.

12:32.052 --> 12:32.985
Wow.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.087
That a real 50 caliber M82 Barret?

12:35.122 --> 12:36.422
Genuine.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.025
Plus we'll even throw in a
few hundred rounds of shells.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.960
Seems like a little overkill.

12:40.994 --> 12:44.630
Yeah. But there's a lot of
guys who like their toys.

12:44.665 --> 12:47.300
A lot of guys who might be
willing to trade a vehicle

12:47.334 --> 12:49.335
for a sweet piece of steel like that 50.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.169
You know what I mean?

12:50.204 --> 12:51.771
Where do I sign up?

12:52.739 --> 12:54.507
You think you got what it takes, little man?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.876
This kid could kill a Z at 50 yards away

12:56.910 --> 12:58.911
with a rubber band and a paper clip.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.047
All right. Sign ups in the FU-Bar.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.481
If you do win

13:02.516 --> 13:05.284
and you want to trade it
for a bad mama jama vehicle,

13:05.319 --> 13:07.920
you wanna talk to a guy named Wannamaker.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.523
Oh and if you want side
action talk to Vernon.

13:10.557 --> 13:14.627
But do <i> not</i> bet against that guy.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.662
Darren Cooper.

13:16.697 --> 13:18.598
Ex Ranger Sniper.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.766
Fifty confirmed kills in Afghanistan.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.035
Lethal as they come.

13:45.464 --> 13:46.798
Hey.

13:46.832 --> 13:48.900
You got to do something about her.

13:52.071 --> 13:53.505
I'm not waiting for anybody.

13:53.539 --> 13:55.473
I know, Murphy. Keep your shorts on.

13:55.508 --> 13:57.609
Have you seen a guy in
here named Wannamaker?

13:57.843 --> 13:59.811
What, are we making friends now?

14:06.585 --> 14:09.754
Anybody know anybody in
here named Wannamaker?

14:09.789 --> 14:10.822
Who wants to know?

14:10.856 --> 14:12.691
Oh, we're just lookin' to trade.

14:12.725 --> 14:14.426
You know just a little business.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.428
Yeah,
my friend said he might have a vehicle.

14:16.462 --> 14:17.429
Yeah.

14:17.463 --> 14:20.031
Wannamaker's got cars.

14:20.066 --> 14:22.500
Do you know where he is?

14:26.806 --> 14:29.574
Uh, hey! Uh, hello!

14:29.608 --> 14:31.109
He's not gonna wake up.

14:31.143 --> 14:34.112
Once Wannamaker's down, he's down.

14:34.146 --> 14:36.081
Check back in forty-eight hours.

14:37.049 --> 14:39.117
Well what about you?

14:39.151 --> 14:41.519
You look like a car man.

14:41.887 --> 14:43.421
I don't drive cars.

14:43.456 --> 14:45.123
I drive machines.

14:45.157 --> 14:48.993
Any, uh,
any machine you'd be willing to let go of?

14:49.028 --> 14:50.495
Depends.

14:53.099 --> 14:54.866
What do you got to trade?

14:55.901 --> 14:59.237
Don't worry, darlin'. You're not worth it.

14:59.271 --> 15:02.006
Ain't nothing as sweet as the Formanmobile.

15:02.241 --> 15:04.876
What about that 50 caliber first prize?

15:04.910 --> 15:05.877
Ha!

15:05.911 --> 15:08.880
Even if you do win, and that's a big if,

15:08.914 --> 15:11.750
the Formanmobile is not for sale.

15:11.784 --> 15:12.884
Bio-diesel.

15:12.918 --> 15:14.018
Solar-powered.

15:14.053 --> 15:15.220
Quiet as they come.

15:15.254 --> 15:16.488
Kitchen.

15:16.522 --> 15:17.422
Bathroom.

15:17.456 --> 15:19.891
Fully regenerative internal plumbing system

15:19.925 --> 15:22.293
complete with marine grade PEX fittings.

15:22.328 --> 15:25.363
Built in, we got an NSV machine gun,
flame thrower,

15:25.398 --> 15:28.299
cattle gun, grenade launcher, doom whistle,

15:28.334 --> 15:30.101
plus the usual

15:30.136 --> 15:32.337
wheel spikes, all that.

15:34.707 --> 15:36.775
Look at me teasin' ya.

15:36.809 --> 15:40.345
Ain't no way you're getting
your hands on my baby.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.447
Oh, okay.

15:42.481 --> 15:43.815
Well he's drunk.

15:43.983 --> 15:45.984
Let's go get you signed up, kid.

15:46.018 --> 15:49.554
I got to drain the lizard king.

16:25.124 --> 16:26.524
Hey, Forman!

16:26.892 --> 16:28.660
Forman, you okay?

16:30.129 --> 16:31.563
Forman.

16:44.944 --> 16:46.744
What are you doing?

16:47.513 --> 16:48.713
Get off me!

16:56.355 --> 16:58.456
Zombie. Hell.

16:59.358 --> 17:00.692
What are you?!

17:15.907 --> 17:17.541
Zombie.

17:28.854 --> 17:33.157
Let's hope they'll take a
busted up truck for the entrance fee.

17:34.994 --> 17:38.630
Next. Have your entry fees ready.

18:10.429 --> 18:13.531
No key. Come on.

18:28.781 --> 18:30.348
Ladies and gentlemen.

18:30.683 --> 18:33.017
It's that moment you've
all been waiting for.

18:33.385 --> 18:35.086
It's shootin' time.

18:40.059 --> 18:41.159
I'm Ten Thousand.

18:41.193 --> 18:43.528
Don't need to know your
name to kick your ass.

18:43.562 --> 18:45.229
Registered shooters!

18:45.264 --> 18:48.700
Please hit your marks on
the designated firing line!

18:50.469 --> 18:54.238
All right,
this first round takes place 100 yards out.

18:54.273 --> 18:56.975
When I announce the target Z, you aim.

18:57.009 --> 18:59.110
When I say fire, you shoot.

18:59.144 --> 19:01.012
If you miss, you're out.

19:01.046 --> 19:03.047
This is sudden death, people.

19:03.082 --> 19:05.850
Cuz there ain't no other way these days.

19:05.884 --> 19:07.919
Skeezy over here's gonna be judge.

19:07.953 --> 19:10.154
And what the judge says is final. Yeah?

19:10.189 --> 19:12.724
Last man standing gets the 50!

19:12.758 --> 19:13.691
Hey!

19:13.726 --> 19:15.793
Tell them what second place gets them,
Vernon!

19:16.095 --> 19:17.929
Set of steak knives!

19:19.598 --> 19:21.499
You're a shoe-in, kid.

19:40.386 --> 19:41.419
You lost someone?

19:43.989 --> 19:46.824
Seems like that's all we ever do these days.

19:47.526 --> 19:50.395
Makes you wonder if it's even
worth being around people

19:50.429 --> 19:51.162
anymore.

19:52.898 --> 19:54.799
Was it family?

19:56.135 --> 19:58.136
Yeah, that's what I thought.

20:01.073 --> 20:03.174
You're gonna need a few more of these.

20:13.419 --> 20:15.119
You ready, shooters?!

20:15.487 --> 20:20.525
Let's... kill... some... zombies!

20:29.234 --> 20:33.304
Round one!

20:33.338 --> 20:35.139
There's the first target right there.

20:35.174 --> 20:37.709
Hippie dude with the long hair.

20:38.177 --> 20:39.644
Fire!

20:46.952 --> 20:49.187
All right, who shot grandma?

20:51.190 --> 20:53.057
Voorhees, you're out!

20:55.594 --> 20:57.829
Next target! Hipster with the sweatpants!

20:57.863 --> 20:58.963
Fire!

21:08.474 --> 21:10.942
You okay, Forman?

21:11.744 --> 21:14.245
You don't look so good.

21:14.279 --> 21:16.447
You bleeding?

21:16.482 --> 21:20.184
I'm more than bleeding, you idiot. I'm bit!

21:20.219 --> 21:22.887
Some zombie-looking mother bit me!

21:24.423 --> 21:27.258
If it was a zombie, you'd have turned.

21:31.096 --> 21:32.563
I don't know what he was.

21:32.598 --> 21:33.998
But he wasn't right!

21:34.032 --> 21:36.801
He's like some kind of animal or something.

21:37.836 --> 21:39.837
He took the keys to the Formanmobile.

21:39.872 --> 21:42.473
And he'll steal your stuff too.

21:42.508 --> 21:44.442
And who knows who else he's gonna bite.

21:44.476 --> 21:46.811
You. You. You.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.914
I'm finding that dude

21:49.948 --> 21:52.917
and I'm taking him out
before he has a chance

21:52.951 --> 21:54.786
to bite anyone else.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.154
Who's with me?!

21:56.989 --> 21:58.723
Let's get him! We'll get him!

21:59.658 --> 22:00.424
Let's go!

22:06.265 --> 22:08.132
Anything I need to know?

22:11.370 --> 22:14.438
It's not a zombie.

22:25.950 --> 22:27.784
It's like some kind of

22:27.952 --> 22:29.653
unnatural disaster.

22:38.663 --> 22:40.397
A freakin' zunami.

22:42.767 --> 22:43.366
Uh.

22:43.401 --> 22:44.201
Booongk.

22:44.235 --> 22:45.101
Booongk.

22:45.136 --> 22:46.603
Booongk.

22:46.637 --> 22:49.172
This is not
a test. Repeat. This is not a test.

22:49.207 --> 22:52.576
This is the Citizen Z emergency
broadcast system. There's a...

22:52.610 --> 22:54.277
a flood, a zombie flood,

22:54.312 --> 22:56.346
a zunami of biblical proportions.

22:56.380 --> 22:59.049
If you're anywhere in the
vicinity of Western Kansas,

22:59.083 --> 23:00.550
you need to...

23:00.585 --> 23:03.753
Screw it. You need to get the hell out now!

23:03.788 --> 23:07.757
If you're in Hamilton, Greeley,
Wichita, Kearney County area,

23:07.792 --> 23:10.060
get the hell out now!

23:10.094 --> 23:14.097
Booongk.
Booongk. Booongk.

23:43.894 --> 23:46.997
That's him! That's the Z that bit me!

23:48.032 --> 23:49.366
Uh-oh.

23:49.700 --> 23:52.402
Why do I have a bad feeling about that?

23:52.436 --> 23:53.303
Get the Z!

23:54.972 --> 23:55.872
That's him!

23:55.906 --> 23:58.108
Hey, guys. What's up?

23:58.876 --> 24:00.076
He's not a zombie. He's talkin'.

24:00.111 --> 24:01.945
I said he looked like a zombie.

24:01.979 --> 24:03.079
I mean look at him.

24:03.114 --> 24:04.881
But it doesn't matter. He stole my keys!

24:04.915 --> 24:06.616
Uh, that's a lie.

24:06.651 --> 24:08.685
Then what are you doing at my machine?

24:08.719 --> 24:10.186
Search him.

24:16.827 --> 24:18.194
It is a Z!

24:18.229 --> 24:19.663
I told you.

24:21.299 --> 24:25.235
I am gonna put him down.

24:31.742 --> 24:32.609
No!

25:03.407 --> 25:05.108
Zombies!

25:07.578 --> 25:09.979
Let's go!
Get out of here!

25:31.669 --> 25:33.603
Nice shootin', everybody!

25:34.004 --> 25:35.171
Hey,

25:35.206 --> 25:38.274
people checking out inventory
over at the barter tables,

25:38.509 --> 25:41.177
watch stray bullets. Thanks.

26:08.906 --> 26:10.673
What?

26:10.708 --> 26:11.408
What?

26:11.442 --> 26:12.742
You bit that guy?

26:12.777 --> 26:15.578
No. No. It was just a fight.

26:15.613 --> 26:17.080
Well what'd you fight him with?

26:17.114 --> 26:19.816
Because he was bleeding. A lot.

26:19.850 --> 26:22.819
I dunno. He was drunk. I didn't see.

26:22.853 --> 26:25.955
I tried to help him,
and then he accused me of stealing from him.

26:25.990 --> 26:28.091
You tried to help him?

26:28.459 --> 26:30.894
Come on, man. Level with me.

26:32.263 --> 26:36.032
Screw it. We need a vehicle,
and we need it more than he does.

26:36.066 --> 26:37.867
Because I'm the savior of humanity.

26:37.902 --> 26:39.969
Remember? Priority number one.

26:40.004 --> 26:42.906
So we do what we got to do.
And sometimes we steal stuff.

26:42.940 --> 26:44.908
Did you bite him?

26:44.942 --> 26:46.776
Doc, you know me.

26:46.811 --> 26:49.979
I am not an animal.

26:50.014 --> 26:52.482
What happened to your tooth?

26:55.152 --> 26:56.586
Look.

26:56.821 --> 26:57.854
Stay here.

26:57.888 --> 26:59.989
I'm gonna go get the others.

27:00.024 --> 27:03.359
I'm very disappointed.

27:16.907 --> 27:19.342
We got five contestants left.

27:19.710 --> 27:20.944
Next target.

27:21.312 --> 27:22.679
Cowboy hat.

27:23.047 --> 27:23.847
Fire!

27:32.223 --> 27:33.256
Snyder, you're out.

27:33.290 --> 27:35.525
Mulligan, you're out.

27:36.927 --> 27:38.595
Good shootin', Mulligan.

27:38.629 --> 27:42.031
Better luck next year.
If there is a next year.

27:42.066 --> 27:44.968
All right, we got three contestants left!

27:45.002 --> 27:50.773
So let's up the ante and let's
take it out to 400 yards!

27:53.043 --> 27:54.077
We need to get out of here.

27:54.111 --> 27:55.612
We can't, not yet.

27:55.646 --> 27:57.113
He's still in it?

27:57.147 --> 27:58.314
Oh yeah.

27:58.349 --> 27:59.349
That's our boy.

28:17.134 --> 28:19.235
Your friends didn't even cover you up.

28:20.037 --> 28:21.804
Savages.

28:22.907 --> 28:24.541
You didn't turn.

28:50.627 --> 28:53.413
All right, we got three contestants left.

28:55.148 --> 28:56.648
Let's up the ante!

28:56.683 --> 29:00.819
Let's take her out 500 yards!

29:02.722 --> 29:06.058
Why are you called Ten Thousand?

29:06.092 --> 29:07.392
It's how many Zs I plan to kill.

29:07.427 --> 29:08.727
How many you got?

29:08.761 --> 29:10.195
Not counting today...

29:10.229 --> 29:11.964
Two thousand one hundred nineteen.

29:11.998 --> 29:13.632
I'll still get more than you today.

29:13.666 --> 29:14.866
Maybe.

29:15.301 --> 29:17.603
Maybe not.

29:18.037 --> 29:19.871
The dude with the coveralls!

29:19.906 --> 29:21.239
Fire!

29:27.180 --> 29:29.548
Sorry! You're gone!

29:31.017 --> 29:33.585
You got this, kid. You got this!

29:37.857 --> 29:39.291
You ready to give up?

29:39.492 --> 29:40.559
Never.

29:41.561 --> 29:42.561
Never?

29:42.595 --> 29:44.963
If this is your attempt
at trying to psych me out,

29:44.998 --> 29:45.697
you're failing miserably.

29:45.732 --> 29:47.399
Stay focused.

29:48.401 --> 29:50.902
That gun is mine.

30:01.014 --> 30:02.314
Zombies.

30:02.749 --> 30:05.150
Zombies inside the perimeter!

30:05.885 --> 30:08.420
Okay, listen up everybody. We...

30:08.454 --> 30:11.556
we need a few people to go
check and clean up some Zs

30:11.591 --> 30:13.291
and see what's going on at the perimeter.

30:13.326 --> 30:14.926
Look people, no one's gonna win anything

30:14.961 --> 30:16.995
unless we stop these Zs
from spoiling our fun!

30:17.030 --> 30:17.896
All right?

30:17.930 --> 30:18.797
Stay here.

30:18.831 --> 30:20.799
You keep shooting.

30:31.310 --> 30:33.445
Where the hell they all come from?

30:46.192 --> 30:48.827
So you're a zombie now.

30:48.861 --> 30:50.829
That's just perfect.

30:52.665 --> 30:55.434
I guess that makes you a
liar like everyone else.

30:55.468 --> 30:58.336
No, no, it's okay.

30:58.371 --> 31:00.405
I don't blame you.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.008
If it's anybody's fault,

31:03.710 --> 31:05.143
it's mine.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.550
I shoulda known better, Charlie.

31:14.554 --> 31:16.755
I shoulda.

31:22.361 --> 31:24.930
But you were so...

31:24.964 --> 31:27.399
I used to just watch you

31:27.433 --> 31:28.800
back when we started.

31:30.837 --> 31:33.472
I know you don't like to talk about this.

31:33.506 --> 31:38.276
But it doesn't make you bad
that you like to kill them

31:38.311 --> 31:40.045
and it turns you on.

31:41.380 --> 31:43.181
It doesn't.

31:43.716 --> 31:46.752
It's what made me believe in you.

31:47.653 --> 31:51.723
You were such a badass. Oh man.

31:51.758 --> 31:53.492
Not like those blind idiots

31:53.526 --> 31:56.361
always dreaming of a life
that will never come back.

31:56.395 --> 31:58.897
No, you weren't blind.

32:00.199 --> 32:03.235
You saw it, and you faced it.

32:03.269 --> 32:06.471
So when you told me there was a way,

32:07.473 --> 32:09.708
a way to live again,

32:11.778 --> 32:14.012
I believed you.

32:16.149 --> 32:20.018
You made me believe you.

32:23.022 --> 32:25.257
How could you do that to me?

32:26.159 --> 32:28.727
You gave me...

32:32.431 --> 32:34.666
Hope.

32:34.967 --> 32:37.335
That I, that we,

32:37.370 --> 32:40.772
could have some kind of life. And I...

32:44.977 --> 32:47.612
I loved you for that.

32:47.980 --> 32:50.282
Then it got you killed.

32:51.384 --> 32:53.952
You had hope,

32:53.986 --> 32:56.288
and it made you weak.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.590
It made me weak.

33:00.426 --> 33:03.261
How could you do that, Charlie?

33:03.296 --> 33:05.063
How could you

33:06.299 --> 33:08.066
give me all of that

33:09.168 --> 33:10.936
and then take it away?

33:11.304 --> 33:13.205
How could you?

33:18.211 --> 33:19.244
How could you?

33:22.481 --> 33:23.415
How could you?

33:49.575 --> 33:51.309
Just guessing.

33:59.085 --> 34:01.620
If you don't have a reason to live,

34:02.355 --> 34:04.356
you might as well die.

34:05.591 --> 34:07.659
That's all you did.

34:07.693 --> 34:09.960
Cuz you gave me a reason.

34:09.996 --> 34:12.297
And it was a nice one.

34:12.665 --> 34:16.134
A beautiful lie, really.

34:17.803 --> 34:20.272
It won't ever be beautiful like that.

34:21.440 --> 34:24.476
But I'll find a reason to live.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.712
I will.

34:31.417 --> 34:33.952
I give you mercy.

34:42.561 --> 34:46.965
Okay! We're 500 yards out,
and we can't go any further!

34:47.233 --> 34:48.867
So best shot wins!

34:49.902 --> 34:52.170
This is for all the cookies!

34:55.775 --> 34:57.042
First up!

34:57.076 --> 34:58.677
The judge!

35:02.581 --> 35:03.748
Fire!

35:03.783 --> 35:04.916
Ladies first.

35:04.951 --> 35:06.918
Screw you. I'm no lady.

35:07.753 --> 35:08.887
Okay.

35:22.668 --> 35:23.902
Beat that.

35:24.370 --> 35:24.970
kay.

35:32.745 --> 35:35.213
Two bullets, one hole.

35:36.449 --> 35:38.249
I'm callin' it a tie.

35:40.386 --> 35:42.420
Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen.

35:42.455 --> 35:44.956
We got ourselves a barn burner here.

35:44.991 --> 35:48.393
This thing's going into
sudden death overtime!

35:49.128 --> 35:50.628
So come on over and see me

35:50.663 --> 35:53.498
and put down your bets
before the next round!

35:55.267 --> 35:57.435
All right, people. Place your bets.

35:57.470 --> 35:59.371
Come on. Put them down.

36:06.712 --> 36:07.979
Oh shit.

36:14.317 --> 36:15.935
We got a couple of fresh runners.

36:16.035 --> 36:18.102
You first. I'll clean up.

36:33.352 --> 36:34.118
Our driver!

36:34.386 --> 36:35.453
Our driver!

36:35.554 --> 36:37.855
They're getting Side Meat!

36:41.794 --> 36:43.094
Give the man mercy!

36:48.133 --> 36:49.067
Nice shootin'.

36:49.468 --> 36:51.736
Hey, we've got ourselves a winner!

36:51.770 --> 36:53.137
Nice job, kid.

36:53.172 --> 36:55.940
Now let's get your prize and
get the hell out of here.

36:55.975 --> 36:56.975
Good shootin'.

37:01.947 --> 37:04.248
To the victor goes the spoils!

37:05.351 --> 37:08.086
Kill in good health, kid.
Now get out of dodge.

37:09.555 --> 37:10.788
Closing time!

37:24.737 --> 37:26.137
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

37:45.090 --> 37:45.990
I'm getting low on ammo.

37:46.025 --> 37:46.724
Yeah, me too.

37:47.493 --> 37:48.926
Where are these Zs coming from?

37:50.629 --> 37:53.364
I dunno. But where the hell is my dad?

37:56.068 --> 37:57.502
We can't wait much longer.

37:57.936 --> 37:58.803
Brittany!

37:58.837 --> 37:59.737
There he is.

37:59.772 --> 38:01.005
Brittany!

38:06.311 --> 38:07.245
I'm out.

38:12.651 --> 38:14.819
Two thousand two hundred five.

38:15.788 --> 38:16.654
Nice shooting, kid!

38:16.688 --> 38:18.856
Come on, Brit! We got to go!

38:19.591 --> 38:20.725
Wait!

38:23.862 --> 38:25.363
Take this.

38:25.397 --> 38:26.998
You deserve it more than I do.

38:28.967 --> 38:30.435
Really. I want you to have it.

38:30.469 --> 38:32.470
Brit. We got to go.

38:35.240 --> 38:36.374
Thank you.

38:40.946 --> 38:42.513
Good luck, kid.

38:59.164 --> 39:00.598
Where'd you come from?

40:19.411 --> 40:20.678
You're looking better.

40:22.047 --> 40:23.214
Who's next?

40:28.058 --> 40:29.526
How much longer are we gonna wait for him?

40:29.560 --> 40:30.493
Not much.

40:30.528 --> 40:31.828
He'll be here.

40:33.330 --> 40:34.831
Hey!

40:44.308 --> 40:45.542
Hold him steady, kid!

40:45.576 --> 40:46.576
I can't!

41:28.886 --> 41:30.720
You know where you're going?

41:31.622 --> 41:33.189
Followin' the sun.

41:34.358 --> 41:35.391
It's what Charlie...

41:37.561 --> 41:39.062
It's what he would do.

41:41.265 --> 41:43.266
I hope we catch up with Mack and Addy.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.268
Yeah, I hope so too.

41:49.106 --> 41:50.540
Well, people.

41:50.574 --> 41:52.875
If we weren't already in an apocalypse,

41:52.910 --> 41:54.877
this would be a damn obvious sign.

41:55.245 --> 41:58.348
What do you call something worse
than an apocalypse? Because

41:58.382 --> 42:00.883
this is it. Whatever it is.

42:00.918 --> 42:04.721
Swarm, horde, zunami.
There's no end in sight.

42:04.755 --> 42:06.990
If you're not already west of this thing,

42:07.024 --> 42:09.459
you better get moving.
There's no getting through it.

42:09.493 --> 42:10.860
There's no outrunning it.

42:10.894 --> 42:13.997
You got to find some place safe and hide.

42:14.832 --> 42:16.299
Good luck, people.

42:16.667 --> 42:18.768
And Godspeed.
