WEBVTT

00:10.637 --> 00:12.972
Do you know who he is?

00:16.768 --> 00:18.520
Who he really is?

00:21.690 --> 00:24.150
Shadow Moon...

00:24.317 --> 00:26.319
You're my man now.

00:26.486 --> 00:28.279
You've gotten yourself
mixed up

00:28.446 --> 00:30.156
in some really weird shit,
Shadow.

00:30.323 --> 00:32.867
You shouldn't
trust him. Grimnir. Don't trust him.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.704
Trying to start a war,
Glad-O-War?

00:35.870 --> 00:38.498
We're at war already
and we're losing.

00:38.665 --> 00:40.250
Who are you?

00:40.417 --> 00:42.669
You wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.173
What should I believe?

00:47.340 --> 00:49.884
- What's today?
- Wednesday.

00:50.051 --> 00:52.429
Today's my day.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.132
This is all too big.

03:34.299 --> 03:36.759
Too much going on at once.

03:39.721 --> 03:41.598
We should start with a story.

03:41.764 --> 03:43.224
Oh, Jesus, Nancy!

03:43.391 --> 03:44.809
I'm gonna tell you a story.

03:44.976 --> 03:48.104
Haven't got time for a story.
Just do the fucking work, huh?

03:48.271 --> 03:50.607
Let me tell
a goddamned story!

03:51.649 --> 03:53.776
I got a good one.

03:54.819 --> 03:56.529
Real good.

03:56.696 --> 03:58.865
Once upon a time...

03:59.032 --> 04:01.659
See? It sounds good already.

04:01.826 --> 04:03.202
You're hooked.

04:03.369 --> 04:05.204
Just get on with it, huh?

04:08.416 --> 04:09.876
Once upon a time,

04:10.043 --> 04:11.586
there was a fucking queen.

04:12.629 --> 04:14.172
She had it all,

04:14.339 --> 04:16.841
the glory, the power.

04:17.008 --> 04:20.970
Worshippers, eager to give
and grateful to receive.

04:21.137 --> 04:23.139
Why?

04:23.306 --> 04:26.267
Because she had the gift
of the gift.

04:26.434 --> 04:30.188
The blessing of blessings,
hers to bestow.

04:31.481 --> 04:33.483
And her place of worship?

04:35.735 --> 04:37.695
Well, that was the place to be.

04:38.738 --> 04:41.240
THAT was the goddamn shit.

05:30.540 --> 05:33.376
It was
good fucking times.

06:09.787 --> 06:12.248
Kings didn't like that.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.542
Kings came one after the other

06:14.709 --> 06:17.003
to knock her off her throne.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.590
They didn't last long.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.169
When the queen
was done with you...

07:41.212 --> 07:43.381
..you were gone.

07:43.548 --> 07:45.716
Worse ways to go.

08:30.845 --> 08:34.182
Clothes and hair
change with the times,

08:34.348 --> 08:35.975
but this queen...

08:37.768 --> 08:40.021
..she kept the party going.

09:14.096 --> 09:18.935
♪ As a friend
Not as a fighter

09:21.229 --> 09:26.400
♪ I come as someone you invited

09:27.610 --> 09:30.821
♪ You seem to confess

09:31.864 --> 09:34.951
♪ It's all so senseless

09:38.746 --> 09:40.539
♪ Ah

09:40.706 --> 09:42.625
♪ Oh

09:42.792 --> 09:44.335
♪ Ah. ♪

09:49.423 --> 09:51.550
But the kings,

09:51.717 --> 09:54.804
they kept coming after her.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.724
Our queen's power,

09:58.891 --> 10:01.519
which is the power
of all women,

10:01.686 --> 10:05.606
the power of rebirth
and creation.

10:07.817 --> 10:11.153
It makes some men kneel in awe

10:11.320 --> 10:12.947
and give gifts.

10:13.114 --> 10:16.242
But it makes other men angry.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.706
And you know it -

10:21.872 --> 10:25.710
anger gets shit done.

10:28.087 --> 10:29.588
So men did what they do.

10:29.755 --> 10:34.176
They took from her that power.
Took them a long time.

10:34.343 --> 10:38.597
Took them guns and knives
and sharp dicks.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.808
But they grabbed the power

10:40.975 --> 10:43.394
they were too scared
for a queen to have.

10:49.442 --> 10:51.027
They laundered it

10:51.193 --> 10:53.779
and gave it to men.

10:53.946 --> 10:58.534
They forced our queen
into the back seat.

10:59.577 --> 11:01.871
<i>The remaining flight time</i>

11:02.038 --> 11:04.540
<i>to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport
is 11 hours.</i>

11:04.707 --> 11:06.542
<i>So sit back, relax and enjoy...</i>

11:06.709 --> 11:08.711
"Where is the library?"

11:09.754 --> 11:11.422
"Where is the library?"

11:17.303 --> 11:20.639
Now, our queen,
she made her peace with change.

11:20.806 --> 11:22.183
She told herself

11:22.350 --> 11:24.810
the back seat's
got cushions too.

11:24.977 --> 11:26.562
She told herself

11:26.729 --> 11:28.981
she was playing the game

11:29.148 --> 11:31.484
by staying in it.

11:33.486 --> 11:35.571
Excuse me.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.616
Do you know
where the bathroom is?

11:38.783 --> 11:40.618
There's one in the back.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.829
I don't see it.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.667
Show me.

12:34.839 --> 12:36.382
Where did 30F run off to?

12:36.549 --> 12:39.218
So long
as I'm still alive...

12:40.261 --> 12:41.637
..I can adapt.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.472
So you can
let everyone back home

12:43.639 --> 12:45.057
know where you're going.

12:45.224 --> 12:48.519
I still know what I am.

13:24.889 --> 13:26.265
But America too

13:26.432 --> 13:28.934
can take issue
with a woman of power.

13:29.101 --> 13:32.563
It finds ways
of cutting her down,

13:32.730 --> 13:36.317
of punishing her
for her daring to be.

14:31.622 --> 14:33.415
And our girl...

14:34.875 --> 14:38.504
..after a while, even she forgot
there's a queen inside.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.278
<i>ISIS fighters
destroyed the ancient temple,</i>

15:02.444 --> 15:04.196
<i>a once popular
tourist attraction</i>

15:04.363 --> 15:06.490
<i>recently denounced
by ISIS militants</i>

15:06.657 --> 15:09.868
<i>as "the necessary destruction
of idolatrous structures</i>

15:10.035 --> 15:12.621
<i>"in accordance
with Islamic law."</i>

15:12.788 --> 15:14.707
And there's no end

15:14.873 --> 15:19.044
to the cruelty of men
threatened by strong women.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.552
So what's a queen to do?

15:28.262 --> 15:30.806
She gets on her knees.

15:30.973 --> 15:35.019
She takes
what she don't want to

15:35.185 --> 15:38.147
and we watch
in easy fucking judgement

15:38.314 --> 15:42.693
and pretend we'd do a single thing
different in her shoes.

15:56.457 --> 15:58.000
Hm.

15:59.043 --> 16:01.086
I hear they blew up your altar.

16:03.631 --> 16:05.174
Darn.

16:05.341 --> 16:08.969
I have a new one to offer you.

16:11.722 --> 16:13.766
Aren't you the lucky duck?

16:19.188 --> 16:21.231
Oh!

16:21.398 --> 16:23.025
Boop.

16:23.192 --> 16:25.069
OK.

16:32.785 --> 16:36.038
Worship
is a volume business.

16:37.456 --> 16:42.586
Whosoever has the most followers
wins the game.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.097
Want to play?

16:55.224 --> 16:58.602
Life is long
when you got regret.

16:59.895 --> 17:03.982
A moment can last forever

17:04.149 --> 17:06.985
when you can see
how it should have gone.

17:08.654 --> 17:11.240
You get the moral to this story?

17:11.407 --> 17:13.283
I don't know.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.035
Don't compromise?

17:15.202 --> 17:16.578
Or, uh...

17:16.745 --> 17:18.497
..don't cut deals
with treacherous motherfuckers.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.541
What? No!

17:20.708 --> 17:22.167
Fuck, no!

17:22.334 --> 17:24.211
Did you get this one
off the discount rack?

17:24.378 --> 17:26.422
Where are you getting in life

17:26.588 --> 17:28.257
without some fucking compromise?

17:28.424 --> 17:29.675
The moral is...

17:29.842 --> 17:31.218
Get myself a queen.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.845
You goddamn right.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.472
You better get yourself a queen.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.392
'Cause you just went and killed
one of theirs.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.603
That's one of mine.
I killed one of mine.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.397
Not anymore.

17:43.564 --> 17:47.526
Not in a LONG while
has he been one of yours.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.903
You separate a head from a body,

17:50.070 --> 17:53.907
that is strike fucking one
across the bow.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.826
They ain't gonna
take that lightly.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.036
Good - wait till
he sees strike two,

17:58.203 --> 18:00.581
when I get myself that queen.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.714
What about you?

18:08.881 --> 18:11.759
Spill blood together,
that binds you to him for life.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.595
- Yeah, the fuck it does.
- Fuck it doesn't.

18:14.762 --> 18:17.598
- Now, we have a compact.
- Yeah. Till you piss me off.

18:17.765 --> 18:19.475
You've just gone
and pissed me off, OK?

18:19.641 --> 18:21.101
So I think that violates
our agreement.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.811
What are you so pissed off
about?

18:24.855 --> 18:27.191
You just cut off
your friend's head!

18:27.357 --> 18:28.233
OK?

18:28.400 --> 18:29.777
Now you're getting a suit made

18:29.943 --> 18:31.320
like you're
the goddamn Godfather?

18:31.487 --> 18:32.863
Who the fuck
did you think he was?

18:33.030 --> 18:34.406
You're getting one too.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.950
We have to be presentable,
where we're going.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.494
Fuck you!

18:38.660 --> 18:40.370
Look, I don't even
know your name!

18:40.537 --> 18:42.664
Hey, Mr Wednesday?
Who I met on a Wednesday.

18:42.831 --> 18:45.834
I don't think you understand
the concept of 'pissed off'.

18:46.001 --> 18:48.128
It's angry.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.631
Oh, I know what pissed off is.
I'm pissed off!

18:50.798 --> 18:53.342
So as a pissed-off person,
I'm aware.

18:53.509 --> 18:54.968
You're confused.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.304
You got questions,
but you don't know how to ask them.

18:57.471 --> 19:00.557
Do not confuse confusion
for anger.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.936
I'm not confused.

19:06.355 --> 19:08.982
I'm VERY confused.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.151
You're confused.
And you're intrigued.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.904
Your wife came back from the dead.
Why wouldn't you be?

19:14.071 --> 19:15.823
If you denied it,
I'd call you a liar.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.825
- A bigger one than I am.
- Ha!

19:17.991 --> 19:20.244
And that's a very big liar.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.370
Hm...

19:21.537 --> 19:24.540
The terms of our agreement
are intact.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.167
You're not angry, Shadow.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.962
But you do have to start
getting angry.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.507
Angry...gets shit done.

19:34.550 --> 19:36.343
Try that on for size.

20:57.341 --> 20:58.717
Is this Wisconsin?

20:58.884 --> 21:00.677
That's our NEXT stop.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.472
Welcome to Kentucky.

21:15.150 --> 21:18.403
Now, be nice to the lady we're visiting,
but not too nice.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.531
She might take a fancy to you
and that would not be good.

21:21.698 --> 21:25.410
Why? She an ex-girlfriend
of yours?

21:26.453 --> 21:29.164
Not for all the little plastic toys
in China.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.166
No, she's...

21:32.542 --> 21:34.419
She's something else.

21:50.102 --> 21:53.605
We might not be welcome
at first.

22:33.270 --> 22:37.816
Ah...in the presence of a queen.

23:00.464 --> 23:02.090
Huh. Forgot it was Easter.

23:02.257 --> 23:05.969
Well, it is Sunday,
16th of April,

23:06.136 --> 23:08.638
seven days
after the vernal equinox.

23:11.099 --> 23:14.227
- I love Easter.
- Oh, many do.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.398
Some for the rabbits,
some for the resurrection.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.193
Most think of the food.

23:21.359 --> 23:23.904
All that fucking sugar, huh?

23:24.071 --> 23:26.656
They don't think
of the truth of the day.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.910
And why would they?

23:31.787 --> 23:33.705
But, yeah, you could...

23:33.872 --> 23:36.541
..you could call this Easter.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.418
Or we could call it
what it really is.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.588
A pagan ritual, the celebration
of the beginning of spring,

23:41.755 --> 23:44.174
dating back about 12,000 years.

23:44.341 --> 23:46.843
So when you see children
dipping eggs

23:47.010 --> 23:49.137
in vinegar the colours
of their favourite toys,

23:49.304 --> 23:53.016
when you see the nation's youth
fleeing south for copulation,

23:53.183 --> 23:55.102
or when they spread their seed

23:55.268 --> 23:58.021
over that sinking mass
that is the great state of Florida,

23:58.188 --> 23:59.773
they all...

23:59.940 --> 24:01.650
..without realising it,

24:01.817 --> 24:04.444
do it in her name.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.572
Ostara.

24:11.785 --> 24:13.745
Hello!

24:16.581 --> 24:19.417
Oh, it is a treasure and a treat

24:19.584 --> 24:21.795
to welcome you all to my home

24:21.962 --> 24:25.132
and on my day,
my favourite day of the year.

24:25.298 --> 24:28.260
When all is lavender and dew,

24:28.426 --> 24:30.345
reborn and restored.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.264
- When we celebrate...
- Hello, Shadow.

24:34.975 --> 24:36.518
Hey.

24:37.561 --> 24:38.979
Do I know you?

24:39.146 --> 24:41.648
Yes, you do.

24:43.108 --> 24:45.944
..and then move on.

24:46.111 --> 24:48.738
I think it's important
for us all to remember

24:48.905 --> 24:52.409
what this day is
really, truly about, which is...

24:52.576 --> 24:55.537
Ooh, for Christ's sake.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.749
Praise the Lords.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.711
Please help yourself
and those less fortunate to the buffet.

25:02.878 --> 25:04.963
I got plenty of honey ham.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.382
But for those of you
who do not partake of pork...

25:07.549 --> 25:09.509
That's...

25:10.635 --> 25:12.721
..Easter?

25:12.888 --> 25:14.639
Because people
believe in Easter.

25:14.806 --> 25:18.226
Believing is seeing.

25:18.393 --> 25:20.562
Gods are real
if you believe in them.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.543
Gods.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.128
Uh-huh.

25:45.295 --> 25:47.047
Fuck me.

25:47.214 --> 25:49.549
- Alright, so...
- Hm?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.676
That's...Jesus Christ.

25:51.843 --> 25:53.220
A Jesus Christ.

25:53.386 --> 25:56.139
Some Jesus Christ.

25:56.306 --> 25:59.184
For every belief, every branch,
every denomination,

25:59.351 --> 26:02.270
they see a different face
when they close their eyes to pray.

26:02.437 --> 26:04.481
So who are you?

26:04.648 --> 26:08.735
Like I said, you wouldn't
believe in me if I told you.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.324
Happy Easter, you old fraud.

26:14.491 --> 26:17.369
And a fair Ostara to you.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.412
What the hell
are you doing here?

26:19.579 --> 26:21.623
I'm not here for Christ's sake,
but all our sakes.

26:21.790 --> 26:23.166
You look divine.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.876
How the hell else should I look?

26:25.043 --> 26:28.213
Say hello to Ostara.

26:30.674 --> 26:32.759
Hey, Ostara.

26:33.802 --> 26:36.054
Oh, he's a blusher.

26:36.221 --> 26:37.430
- Wednesday.
- Mm-hm?

26:37.597 --> 26:39.099
- You brought me a blusher.
- Mm-hm.

26:39.266 --> 26:42.560
And he's pink chocolate.
How perfectly wonderful.

26:42.727 --> 26:44.771
What's he called?

26:44.938 --> 26:47.065
Shadow Moon.

26:57.409 --> 26:59.619
So, how's tricks?

26:59.786 --> 27:02.747
Asks the tricksiest rabbit
I know.

27:02.914 --> 27:06.251
Well, I was hoping
to enlist your assistance.

27:06.418 --> 27:08.336
Stop wasting time.

27:08.503 --> 27:11.131
I can't be bothered,
so don't you bother me about it.

27:11.298 --> 27:13.842
Shadow? That's a sweet name.

27:14.009 --> 27:16.720
Now, now, now, now.
Leave him be, huh?

27:16.886 --> 27:18.847
Why do they call you Shadow,
sweetness?

27:19.014 --> 27:20.807
The way I followed my mama
around.

27:20.974 --> 27:23.852
She didn't know
what else to call me.

27:24.019 --> 27:25.854
Well, I deal in sugar, Sugar,

27:26.021 --> 27:28.315
and you're the sweetest damn thing
I've ever seen.

27:30.025 --> 27:32.360
This is the boy
that has everyone so upset?

27:32.527 --> 27:34.237
Ah, you heard?

27:34.404 --> 27:36.740
Well, I keep my ears pricked up.

27:36.906 --> 27:38.366
Come here, sweet Shadow.

27:38.533 --> 27:40.410
Allow me to impart some wisdom.

27:40.577 --> 27:42.912
There's far too many
secret societies out there.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.582
They have no loyalty
and no love.

27:45.749 --> 27:48.918
They range from barely competent
to deeply dangerous.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.421
- You don't sound like one of us.
- I'm not one of you.

27:51.588 --> 27:52.964
Oh, yes, you are.

27:53.131 --> 27:56.634
You're as forgotten, unloved
and unremembered as any of us.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.303
I'm doing just fine.

27:58.470 --> 28:01.431
Happy Easter. Christ is risen.
Hello, boys.

28:01.598 --> 28:03.183
Well, you were
before these assholes were born.

28:03.350 --> 28:05.727
Until the day that Jesus Christ

28:05.894 --> 28:08.355
crawled out
of his stinky old grave,

28:08.521 --> 28:12.901
folks would paint eggs with
dandelions and paprika for her,

28:13.068 --> 28:15.737
to exchange as gifts
at the first sign of spring,

28:15.904 --> 28:18.114
in her name...Ostara.

28:18.281 --> 28:20.784
They still do. They still do!

28:20.950 --> 28:22.327
On my festival days,

28:22.494 --> 28:25.246
they still feast
on eggs and rabbit and candy.

28:25.413 --> 28:27.832
- And they do it in my name.
- Serious question, my dear.

28:27.999 --> 28:30.710
I have no doubt that millions
upon millions exchange tokens

28:30.877 --> 28:32.462
and observe the rituals
of your festival,

28:32.629 --> 28:34.381
all down to the hunting
of the hidden eggs,

28:34.547 --> 28:37.384
but does anybody pray
in your name?

28:38.426 --> 28:40.345
Do they say it in worship?

28:40.512 --> 28:41.971
Oh, they mouth your name,

28:42.138 --> 28:44.808
mm, but they have no idea
what it means, none whatsoever.

28:44.974 --> 28:48.061
Same every spring - you do
all the work, he gets the prayers.

28:48.228 --> 28:50.021
What has gotten into you?

28:50.188 --> 28:52.273
I feel terrible about this.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.858
No. No!

28:54.025 --> 28:56.444
It's her day.
You took it.

28:56.611 --> 28:58.196
You crucified her day.

28:58.363 --> 29:00.365
When they started following you,
everybody else got burned.

29:00.532 --> 29:01.908
In YOUR name.

29:02.075 --> 29:04.160
Happy fucking Easter!

29:04.327 --> 29:06.663
Uh...

29:06.830 --> 29:09.082
N...

29:11.167 --> 29:13.420
- A word.
- Mm-hm.

29:22.303 --> 29:25.557
You shut your mouth before
I slap it off your goddamn face!

29:25.723 --> 29:28.351
Oh... Oh. How dare you?

29:28.518 --> 29:29.936
How dare you?

29:30.103 --> 29:32.188
How dare you come into my home

29:32.355 --> 29:34.232
and uncork
all over Jesus of Nazareth

29:34.399 --> 29:36.860
and all the other Jesuses
who died on the cross

29:37.026 --> 29:39.320
and even the ones who didn't -
how dare you!

29:39.487 --> 29:41.030
These are kind, generous men

29:41.197 --> 29:42.782
and they've come to celebrate
their day.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.325
My day.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.286
God damn it, OUR day!

29:46.453 --> 29:48.830
And you come in here
and disrespect them?

29:48.997 --> 29:51.541
- They are gods, for God's sake!
- They're sons of.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.543
They're men who walk the streets.
They shake hands.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.545
- They take shits.
- Oh!

29:55.712 --> 29:57.881
What I'm doing here
is of no concern to them.

29:58.047 --> 30:00.383
This is your day, love.

30:00.550 --> 30:02.927
Always has been, always will be.

30:03.094 --> 30:06.931
Just don't try to tell me
that THEY all worship you.

30:07.098 --> 30:09.434
I know they don't.
I'm not a fool.

30:09.601 --> 30:12.312
No, you're not.

30:12.479 --> 30:14.397
I am.

30:14.564 --> 30:17.066
An old one.

30:19.986 --> 30:22.322
They killed Vulcan.

30:22.489 --> 30:25.366
They killed my friend.

30:27.076 --> 30:29.829
He pledged his allegiance to me

30:29.996 --> 30:31.831
and forged a blade...

30:34.000 --> 30:36.211
..in my honour.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.385
And they killed him for it.

30:47.222 --> 30:49.098
The NEW gods.

30:50.517 --> 30:52.393
That's why we need you.

30:53.436 --> 30:55.355
That's why we need Spring
to fight them,

30:55.522 --> 30:57.690
to show them who WE are.

30:58.733 --> 31:01.986
Oh, they will worship you.

31:02.153 --> 31:03.863
They will...

31:04.030 --> 31:07.909
..worship you
if you make them pray.

31:08.076 --> 31:09.911
They'll pray to Him.

31:12.121 --> 31:14.958
But he's not
the goddess of spring.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.547
Shadow, my boy,

31:20.713 --> 31:23.466
I need a word
with the fair lady here alone.

31:23.633 --> 31:25.468
Help yourself to a drink.
Two, tops.

31:25.635 --> 31:27.262
Still need you sharp.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.862
You've been avoiding me.

32:27.238 --> 32:28.906
Hm?

32:29.073 --> 32:30.658
My mistake.

32:30.825 --> 32:33.161
I used the phone.

32:33.328 --> 32:36.205
Worst thing you can do
to someone is call them.

32:38.291 --> 32:40.335
I've been occupied.

32:41.377 --> 32:43.171
Yes, you have.

32:44.213 --> 32:47.550
Impressive reach metrics.
Deep penetration.

32:48.593 --> 32:50.553
Total unique impressions
is what sells,

32:50.720 --> 32:54.641
and no-one leaves an impression
more unique than you.

32:56.309 --> 32:58.102
You've done well with me.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.813
VERY well.

33:00.980 --> 33:06.486
Now it's my turn
to do well by you.

33:37.350 --> 33:40.228
I can take care of you.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.106
Hm.

33:43.272 --> 33:45.274
Hands free, honeypot.

33:45.441 --> 33:49.404
I have no intention
of spending the rest of my days

33:49.570 --> 33:52.281
feeding your soul
from the vagina nebula.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.451
But...

33:55.618 --> 33:58.996
..if you point that gun
in the right direction...

34:08.631 --> 34:10.425
Hm?

34:11.968 --> 34:15.221
You're wishing
you had no business with me.

34:16.472 --> 34:19.350
But you do.

34:20.685 --> 34:22.270
You owe.

34:23.312 --> 34:25.273
I'm calling it in.

34:52.008 --> 34:53.551
Is this it?

34:59.390 --> 35:00.892
How'd you find it?

35:06.439 --> 35:08.149
Shadow's here.

35:09.192 --> 35:10.777
Jesus Christ.

35:10.943 --> 35:13.362
Are they all...Jesuses?

35:16.240 --> 35:18.367
Right, of course,
'cause...

35:18.534 --> 35:21.287
..Jesus is real.

35:21.454 --> 35:23.164
Hm.

35:41.474 --> 35:43.017
God damn it.

35:44.727 --> 35:47.772
Hm...

35:51.526 --> 35:53.402
Did you always believe?

35:53.569 --> 35:56.072
Did I always believe?

35:57.448 --> 36:00.493
I AM belief, Shadow.

36:03.287 --> 36:06.207
I don't know how not to believe.

36:10.503 --> 36:13.381
I don't think I know how to.

36:14.632 --> 36:16.717
I think maybe I...

36:16.884 --> 36:20.471
..I don't really believe.

36:22.723 --> 36:25.518
You know, I don't really believe
any of this.

36:27.854 --> 36:30.231
And maybe everything
that's happened so far

36:30.398 --> 36:32.942
is just some kind
of vivid dream.

36:37.321 --> 36:38.698
Um...

36:38.865 --> 36:41.158
I don't even know
if I can believe that.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.705
Even if you don't believe,

36:45.872 --> 36:50.042
you cannot travel
in any other way

36:50.209 --> 36:52.211
than the road...

36:53.588 --> 36:56.549
..your senses show you.

36:58.092 --> 37:01.262
And you must walk that road...

37:02.972 --> 37:04.932
..to the end.

37:08.603 --> 37:10.062
Starve them
into submission?

37:10.229 --> 37:12.440
They used to starve themselves.

37:12.607 --> 37:13.983
40 days.

37:14.150 --> 37:16.861
And not out of worship,
but out of necessity.

37:17.028 --> 37:18.988
Hunger was an ancient form
of prayer

37:19.155 --> 37:20.865
and they've never been hungry.

37:21.032 --> 37:23.868
I mean, they just pluck their food
out of the freezer,

37:24.035 --> 37:25.786
throw it in the microwave,
watch it spin around.

37:25.953 --> 37:28.205
Never once have they
had to work for it,

37:28.372 --> 37:30.124
give thanks for it

37:30.291 --> 37:32.251
or pray to you for it.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.546
Make them pray.

37:35.713 --> 37:37.214
Let them remind themselves

37:37.381 --> 37:40.676
it was a queen
that gave them the harvest.

37:40.843 --> 37:43.262
Oh, they'll be hungry,
but then they'll turn to you

37:43.429 --> 37:47.683
and they will pray to Ostara
once again.

37:47.850 --> 37:50.686
She withholds, she returns.

37:50.853 --> 37:53.981
Prayer, reward.

37:54.148 --> 37:56.067
The ancient contract.

37:59.862 --> 38:01.238
Holy shit.

38:01.405 --> 38:03.824
Hold that thought.

38:04.867 --> 38:07.370
Come on.

38:16.921 --> 38:18.756
Oh!

38:35.523 --> 38:36.941
A dead girl?

38:37.108 --> 38:40.152
I have a house full of guests
and a garage full of caterers

38:40.319 --> 38:42.446
and you brought me a dead girl?

38:43.489 --> 38:45.741
Hi.

38:45.908 --> 38:47.743
- You have a lovely home.
- Don't stoop.

38:47.910 --> 38:50.162
Somebody tried to raise you
with refined manners, dead girl,

38:50.329 --> 38:52.498
and failed.

38:54.917 --> 38:57.211
Let me see you.

38:59.588 --> 39:00.965
She doesn't want to be dead.

39:01.132 --> 39:03.217
Dead gets a bad rap.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.177
I don't want her to be dead.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.263
- Reason being?
- Selfish reasons.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.558
Can you do that?

39:10.725 --> 39:14.145
Professional courtesy.
Colleague to colleague?

39:14.311 --> 39:16.439
You all think I'm like you.
I am not like you.

39:16.605 --> 39:19.775
You, I'm particularly not like.

39:19.942 --> 39:21.610
And that doesn't translate
into courtesies owed,

39:21.777 --> 39:23.362
professional or otherwise.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.905
A favour, then.

39:25.072 --> 39:26.824
You do owe me that.

39:30.286 --> 39:31.704
Who were you, exactly?

39:31.871 --> 39:33.998
I was, uh, Laura Moon.

39:34.165 --> 39:35.958
Um, I'm still Laura Moon.

39:36.125 --> 39:37.793
Laura Moon.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.628
Shadow Moon?

39:39.795 --> 39:42.923
Mm, we know he's here.
We know who he's here with.

39:43.090 --> 39:45.051
Best he doesn't know I'm here.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.428
Best he don't know
who I'm here with.

39:49.138 --> 39:50.890
How do you feel?

39:51.057 --> 39:52.683
I don't mean existentially.

39:52.850 --> 39:54.727
I mean physically.
Sensationally.

39:54.894 --> 39:57.271
Are you IN your body,
but not of it?

39:57.438 --> 40:00.149
Ah, I'm in my body. I feel it.

40:00.316 --> 40:02.818
Death hurts.

40:02.985 --> 40:06.530
I mean, mostly that hurt
is just absences of things.

40:08.491 --> 40:11.410
I'm thirsty all the time.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.537
Fucking parched.

40:13.704 --> 40:15.998
And...cold.

40:17.041 --> 40:18.667
Cold in my bones.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.836
Living in her own apocalypse.

40:22.171 --> 40:24.757
Did, um...did Jesus go through
his own apocalypse

40:24.924 --> 40:26.300
before you brought him
back to life?

40:26.467 --> 40:28.719
Oh, I didn't bring Jesus
back to life, no.

40:28.886 --> 40:30.679
He was dreamed back to life
on my day.

40:30.846 --> 40:33.849
A very narrow sliver
in that Venn diagram.

40:34.016 --> 40:36.018
This is your day.

40:36.185 --> 40:38.437
The vernal equinox,
the light of the world.

40:38.604 --> 40:41.315
Rebirth, renewal, resurrection.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.400
Can you do it?

40:43.567 --> 40:45.236
I can. I have.

40:45.402 --> 40:46.987
I normally wouldn't.

40:47.154 --> 40:49.115
But today
isn't a normally kind of day.

40:51.033 --> 40:53.369
I don't resurrect, I re-life.

40:53.536 --> 40:55.538
Life has always been my gift

40:55.704 --> 40:57.832
to re-gift.

40:57.998 --> 40:59.917
Well, good.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.421
Good, because as it turns out,
I have a lot to live for

41:04.588 --> 41:08.843
and it's so close I can feel it.

41:09.009 --> 41:11.137
It's the only thing
I can feel, so...

41:11.303 --> 41:14.014
I would really like
to not be dead anymore,

41:14.181 --> 41:16.350
so that I can feel it fully.

41:17.393 --> 41:19.645
So...

41:19.812 --> 41:21.188
..how does this work?

41:21.355 --> 41:23.732
How it works is I find out
exactly why you are dead

41:23.899 --> 41:25.276
and we go from there.

41:25.442 --> 41:27.736
Well, I don't know
why this happened.

41:27.903 --> 41:31.490
I mean, I know how,
but I don't know why.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.827
Come. Let me take a look.

41:48.799 --> 41:51.510
I'm starting to get an idea.

41:53.888 --> 41:55.723
Folks have
always been curious

41:55.890 --> 41:57.808
about that exact moment
of death.

42:02.730 --> 42:04.148
As if the difference

42:04.315 --> 42:06.192
between one side of that divide
and the other

42:06.358 --> 42:07.776
could be quantified.

42:07.943 --> 42:10.905
Some believe that you can
develop a last image seen

42:11.071 --> 42:12.740
off their retinas.

42:13.782 --> 42:15.534
Like a photograph.

42:31.175 --> 42:35.179
Death is usually the last enemy.

42:36.222 --> 42:38.557
Right, but not for, uh...
not for Jesus Christ.

42:38.724 --> 42:40.267
No, not for you.

42:40.434 --> 42:42.519
And you're no Jesus Christ.

42:42.686 --> 42:44.688
Are you still working
for the man?

42:46.357 --> 42:47.733
I was.

42:47.900 --> 42:49.944
About that,
we have a problem here.

42:50.110 --> 42:52.238
A...a problem with me?

42:52.404 --> 42:54.531
Oh, no. Not with you, you.

42:54.698 --> 42:56.075
You are perfectly lovely,

42:56.242 --> 42:58.619
but you dead,
yes, is a problem for me.

42:58.786 --> 43:00.412
But you said
you could re-gift the gift.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.748
I need the gift.
I need to be alive.

43:02.915 --> 43:04.750
I can't help you with your dead.

43:04.917 --> 43:07.294
You are dead
of a different kind.

43:07.461 --> 43:08.837
Fuck.

43:09.004 --> 43:10.881
How am I dead different?

43:11.048 --> 43:12.007
Laura Moon...

43:12.174 --> 43:14.176
..you were killed by a god.

43:14.343 --> 43:16.303
I can't interfere with that.

43:16.470 --> 43:17.930
That is a dead without undoing.

43:18.097 --> 43:19.974
Not by my hand, anyway.

43:24.144 --> 43:26.146
Oh, shit.

43:26.313 --> 43:29.900
I have other guests. Good luck.

43:38.409 --> 43:40.286
I was killed...

43:40.452 --> 43:42.329
..by a god?

43:46.083 --> 43:49.253
Which...fucking...god?

43:59.346 --> 44:01.557
Never saw you look
quite so pretty before.

44:01.724 --> 44:06.020
- Happy Easter, Easter.
- Oh...and to you.

44:06.186 --> 44:09.315
I could hardly wait to keep our date
this lovely Easter morning.

44:10.357 --> 44:13.235
And your heart beat fast
as you came through that door.

44:13.402 --> 44:14.820
Um...

44:14.987 --> 44:17.614
- We had a date?
- Standing.

44:17.781 --> 44:19.658
- Our marshmallow peepshow.
- Oh.

44:19.825 --> 44:23.162
Candy cream eggs, cellophane grass,
bunnies and duckies.

44:23.329 --> 44:26.332
We popularised the pagan.
We practically invented brunch.

44:26.498 --> 44:28.542
We built this holiday.

44:28.709 --> 44:30.711
You and me.

44:31.879 --> 44:33.255
We're a couple of swells.

44:33.422 --> 44:36.925
Oh, have you met my sheep?

44:39.470 --> 44:42.639
Which fucking god?

44:42.806 --> 44:45.434
ME fucking god.
I ran you off the road.

44:45.601 --> 44:48.520
See, here I thought I knocked
the gear shift with my shoulder.

44:48.687 --> 44:51.023
All this time,
I've been blaming myself.

44:52.274 --> 44:53.901
Now I have somebody else
to blame, right?

44:55.277 --> 44:57.196
That's right, I killed you!

44:57.363 --> 44:59.239
- I killed you fucking dead!
- No!

44:59.406 --> 45:00.908
You are not a god!

45:01.075 --> 45:02.785
She said I was killed by a god.

45:02.951 --> 45:04.661
You're many things,
but you're not a god.

45:04.828 --> 45:06.705
Which fucking god?

45:07.915 --> 45:10.876
I'll squeeze them straight out
of the sac, like shucking peas.

45:11.043 --> 45:13.128
I swear to Jesus.

45:13.295 --> 45:15.005
He's right outside.

45:16.757 --> 45:18.801
You...you know which god.

45:18.967 --> 45:20.469
Of course I know which god!

45:20.636 --> 45:22.971
I want to hear you
fucking say it, so say it.

45:24.431 --> 45:27.101
Wednesday.

45:29.353 --> 45:30.896
Fuck that guy.

45:31.063 --> 45:33.107
Why?

45:33.273 --> 45:35.609
Why me? Why murder me?

45:35.776 --> 45:38.904
You weren't murdered,
you were sacrificed.

45:45.244 --> 45:47.454
Shadow, right?

45:47.621 --> 45:50.582
So why does Shadow matter?

45:50.749 --> 45:52.376
He doesn't!

45:52.543 --> 45:54.670
He's nothing.

45:55.712 --> 45:57.172
He's no-one who just...

45:57.339 --> 45:59.466
..just happens to be the guy.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.931
When we robbed the casino,

46:06.098 --> 46:08.475
did Wednesday
fuck up my perfect plan?

46:08.642 --> 46:10.602
It wasn't a perfect plan.

46:11.645 --> 46:14.231
Didn't account for
divine intervention, did you?

46:16.358 --> 46:18.652
The whole fucking time?

46:18.819 --> 46:21.864
The robbery,
Shadow going to jail, me dying...

46:22.906 --> 46:24.283
Act of god?

46:24.450 --> 46:26.660
Just fucking with us
to fuck with us?

46:28.537 --> 46:30.581
What do you think gods do?

46:31.623 --> 46:33.667
They do
what they've always done.

46:33.834 --> 46:35.961
They fuck with us.

46:37.754 --> 46:39.882
They fuck with all of us.

46:40.048 --> 46:42.009
Just don't take it personally.

46:44.303 --> 46:46.346
I don't.

46:50.851 --> 46:52.895
He needed your man.

46:54.813 --> 46:56.190
Needed him to be in a place

46:56.356 --> 46:58.984
where he had nothing left
in the world.

47:00.444 --> 47:02.654
Nothing to lose, 'cause...

47:03.989 --> 47:06.033
..he'd already lost everything.

47:13.290 --> 47:15.751
What does Wednesday
have to lose?

47:28.972 --> 47:31.475
They're here.

47:42.402 --> 47:43.779
Is he here?

47:43.946 --> 47:45.447
Is who here?

47:45.614 --> 47:47.699
Oh, He with a capital H?

47:47.866 --> 47:49.785
I've got a gaggle of them
inside.

47:49.952 --> 47:51.745
One of them has got
a baby dinosaur.

47:51.912 --> 47:53.830
That's not the 'he'
I was referring to.

47:53.997 --> 47:58.126
The 'he' I was referring to
was...Wednesday.

47:58.293 --> 48:01.338
Oh, he was here,
trying to enlist me

48:01.505 --> 48:03.340
in some sort of something
he was brewing.

48:10.347 --> 48:12.808
What are the ingredients
of that brew?

48:17.604 --> 48:19.856
I dismissed him
before hearing him out.

48:20.023 --> 48:21.733
I'm doing peachy.

48:21.900 --> 48:23.443
So why would I help him?

48:23.610 --> 48:26.238
That's right.
A god has to be exotic.

48:26.405 --> 48:28.115
She has to be...

48:28.282 --> 48:29.658
..a peach.

48:29.825 --> 48:31.243
And Wednesday...

48:31.410 --> 48:34.204
..well, I suppose he's a lemon.

48:34.371 --> 48:37.708
You're an old god new again.

48:37.874 --> 48:39.668
That's what we offer.

48:39.835 --> 48:41.378
That's what we represent.

48:43.672 --> 48:46.800
You feel
you've been treated unfairly?

48:46.967 --> 48:50.637
I feel misrepresented
in the media.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.098
Put a pillow over that feeling

48:53.265 --> 48:55.475
and bear down
until it stops kicking.

48:55.642 --> 48:58.270
St Nick
took the same deal you did.

48:58.437 --> 49:00.188
The only reason
why you're relevant today

49:00.355 --> 49:02.316
is because Easter
is a Christian holiday.

49:03.942 --> 49:06.194
It's religious Darwinism.

49:06.361 --> 49:08.572
Adapt and survive.

49:08.739 --> 49:11.074
What we have achieved together,
you and I,

49:11.241 --> 49:12.618
is no small feat,

49:12.784 --> 49:15.162
now that we're living
in an atheist world.

49:15.329 --> 49:17.456
Look at you.

49:17.623 --> 49:19.750
Squawk the squawk.

49:19.916 --> 49:21.877
In your Easter bonnet,

49:22.044 --> 49:23.795
with all the frills upon it,

49:23.962 --> 49:26.214
you should be thrilled,
overjoyed

49:26.381 --> 49:28.634
that anyone believes in anything
that doesn't have a screen

49:28.800 --> 49:29.843
anymore.

49:31.511 --> 49:34.598
What happens if they all decide

49:34.765 --> 49:37.934
that God doesn't exist?

49:46.234 --> 49:49.529
What if they decide
God DOES exist?

49:50.572 --> 49:52.074
Whose god?

49:52.240 --> 49:54.618
They're not all
going to choose just one.

49:54.785 --> 49:56.536
Well, it doesn't matter.

49:56.703 --> 50:00.040
Plenty of worship to go around,
once worship gets redistributed.

50:00.207 --> 50:02.417
WE are the distributors.

50:02.584 --> 50:04.961
The platform
and the delivery mechanism.

50:05.128 --> 50:07.172
We control the story.

50:07.339 --> 50:09.091
We control the flow.

50:10.634 --> 50:12.427
We ARE the flow.

50:12.594 --> 50:15.305
What you offer
is existential crisis aversion.

50:15.472 --> 50:17.265
Don't look over there,
look over here.

50:17.432 --> 50:19.351
Don't listen to that,
listen to this.

50:19.518 --> 50:22.270
You provide a product,
an innovative distraction,

50:22.437 --> 50:25.065
and you keep innovating it
and you keep providing it.

50:25.232 --> 50:28.777
The beauty of what we do
is we only need inspire.

50:28.944 --> 50:30.821
Hm. You don't have the juice.

50:30.987 --> 50:33.573
And don't act like
your fucking rent boy here

50:33.740 --> 50:35.200
is your disciple.

50:35.367 --> 50:39.538
Here's the thing...
you're old as fuck.

50:39.705 --> 50:42.916
Things are never going back

50:43.083 --> 50:44.668
to the way that they were.

50:44.835 --> 50:46.837
The times, they are a-changing.

50:47.003 --> 50:50.257
You can't fight progress.

50:51.717 --> 50:53.343
Then why are you here?

50:53.510 --> 50:54.928
Why do I matter?

50:55.095 --> 50:57.305
We're here for her.

50:57.472 --> 50:59.474
We're here for my friend.

50:59.641 --> 51:01.810
And you don't matter.

51:01.977 --> 51:03.854
Not really. Not anymore.

51:04.020 --> 51:06.648
You could have, but...

51:06.815 --> 51:10.193
People create gods when
they wonder why things happen.

51:12.571 --> 51:16.700
Do you know why things happen?
Because gods make them happen.

51:16.867 --> 51:19.411
You want to know
how to make good things happen?

51:19.578 --> 51:21.663
Be good to your god.

51:21.830 --> 51:24.458
You give a little,
you get a little.

51:24.624 --> 51:27.836
The simplicity of that bargain
has always been appealing.

51:28.003 --> 51:32.090
That's why you're here
and that's precisely why I matter.

51:34.468 --> 51:38.013
You only matter
in matters of war.

51:38.180 --> 51:41.725
And there's not going
to be a war.

51:41.892 --> 51:44.060
We have the guns.

51:44.227 --> 51:46.229
We have the firepower.

51:46.396 --> 51:48.607
You have the swords
and knives...

51:48.774 --> 51:50.776
..and hammers and stone axes.

51:53.612 --> 51:56.072
We fight, we win.

51:56.239 --> 51:59.367
We don't fight...we win.

52:00.410 --> 52:02.537
You die out either way.

52:02.704 --> 52:07.334
You are
the passenger pigeons and thylacines.

52:07.501 --> 52:09.961
Nobody cares about you.

52:10.128 --> 52:12.589
It's either
going to be a bloodbath

52:12.756 --> 52:15.467
or we'll wait you out

52:15.634 --> 52:18.220
and get the whole thing
without a fuss.

52:19.262 --> 52:21.014
My message to you...

52:22.182 --> 52:24.309
..don't fight.

52:24.476 --> 52:26.561
I don't have to fight.

52:35.362 --> 52:37.322
I have faith.

52:37.489 --> 52:41.785
I dedicate these deaths
to Ostara.

52:42.869 --> 52:45.205
Which deaths?

53:05.600 --> 53:08.562
Do you have faith, Shadow?

53:12.482 --> 53:14.109
What are you?

53:15.151 --> 53:16.695
Do you know me?

53:16.862 --> 53:18.321
Do you know what I am?

53:18.488 --> 53:20.365
Do you want to know my name?

53:21.825 --> 53:23.201
Tell me.

53:23.368 --> 53:25.871
This is what I am called.

53:26.037 --> 53:30.500
I am called Glad-O-War,
Grim, Raider and Third.

53:32.168 --> 53:33.879
I am One-Eyed.

53:34.045 --> 53:36.131
I am also called Highest
and True-Guesser.

53:36.298 --> 53:39.885
I am Grimnir and the Hooded One.

53:40.051 --> 53:42.971
I am All-Father,
Gondlir Wand-bearer.

53:43.138 --> 53:45.765
I have as many names
as there are winds,

53:45.932 --> 53:48.560
as many titles
as there are ways to die!

53:48.727 --> 53:52.606
My ravens are Huginn and Muninn.
Thought and Memory!

53:52.772 --> 53:54.691
My wolves are Freki and Geri!

53:54.858 --> 53:56.443
My horse is the gallowed.

53:56.610 --> 54:03.283
I am ODIN!

54:05.452 --> 54:06.745
Odin?

54:06.912 --> 54:08.496
Odin!

54:08.663 --> 54:11.166
And you are Ostara of the dawn.

54:11.333 --> 54:15.587
Show them who you are.

56:25.717 --> 56:27.093
What have you done?

56:29.429 --> 56:32.640
You wanted a war,
Glad-of-War?

we've taken the spring.

They can have it back...

56:54.913 --> 56:56.623
..when they pray for it.

57:00.877 --> 57:03.129
Do you believe?

57:07.092 --> 57:08.468
I believe.

57:08.635 --> 57:10.720
What do you believe, Shadow?

57:13.973 --> 57:15.600
Everything.

57:33.868 --> 57:36.788

with my husband.
