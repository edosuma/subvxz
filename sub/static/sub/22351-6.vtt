00:01.950 --> 00:04.990
>> Announcer: Previously on "big
brother" --

00:04.990 --> 00:10.990
Shelli, Audrey and df formed an
alliance on day one.

00:10.990 --> 00:12.990
>> Oh, my God.

00:12.990 --> 00:13.990
Female power, baby.

00:13.990 --> 00:15.990
Watch out, boys.

00:15.990 --> 00:24.990
>> Announcer: But when Shelli
got close to Clay -- Mama Da'

00:24.990 --> 00:25.120
cut Shelli loose.

00:25.120 --> 00:30.700
>> She might have to be on the
outer ring.

00:30.700 --> 00:31.990
>> Shelli's relationship with
Clay is a problem.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.990
She's not going to stay solid to
the girls' alliance.

00:35.990 --> 00:38.990
>> Announcer: Then after a
confrontation with Clay --

00:38.990 --> 00:41.000
>> this is the most idiotic
conversation --

00:41.000 --> 00:43.990
>> then stop having it.

00:43.990 --> 00:46.990
Announcer: Lines were drawn
in the sand.

00:46.990 --> 00:47.990
>> Mama Da', I don't know why
you're so paranoid.

00:47.990 --> 00:49.410
It's going to get you evicted
eventually.

00:49.410 --> 00:52.990
>> Announcer: When Audrey tried
to control the situation.

00:52.990 --> 00:54.990
>> Pozgize because she started
crying.

00:54.990 --> 00:57.990
>> Announcer: Is only made mama
da' more upset.

00:57.990 --> 01:00.830
>> I'm irritated with Audrey
because I'm thinking you're

01:00.830 --> 01:02.990
trying to manipulate me right
now.

01:02.990 --> 01:04.990
You're trying to be the puppet
master.

01:04.990 --> 01:07.830
>> Announcer: Worried about her
fractured alliance.

01:07.830 --> 01:11.990
>> I feel like it's really
important to start lining the

01:11.990 --> 01:13.990
troops.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.990
>> Announcer: Audrey went on a
midnight hunt for new members.

01:15.990 --> 01:16.990
>> Thanks a lot, Audrey.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.990
I guess you're just going to
pick and choose and do what you

01:19.990 --> 01:20.830
want.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.990
>> Announcer: Leaving people
questioning her game play.

01:22.990 --> 01:25.540
>> I'm starting to have second
thoughts about Audrey.

01:25.540 --> 01:27.990
I think Audrey's going to be on
the chopping block if she's not

01:27.990 --> 01:28.990
careful.

01:28.990 --> 01:31.410
>> Announcer: And after a
confrontation with Jace --

01:31.410 --> 01:33.990
>> I trusted you and you
betrayed me.

01:33.990 --> 01:35.990
It's as simple as that.

01:35.990 --> 01:38.410
>> Announcer: The target on
Audrey's wack continued to grow.

01:38.410 --> 01:39.990
>> You're still sitting here
lying to everybody, trying to

01:39.990 --> 01:41.990
make it seem like you're not the
bad person.

01:41.990 --> 01:43.990
>> You sound crazy.

01:43.990 --> 01:46.290
Announcer: At the live
eviction, the house said later

01:46.290 --> 01:49.990
to the skater.

01:49.990 --> 01:52.990
>> Julie: With 12 votes to
evict, Jace, you are evicted

01:52.990 --> 01:57.700
from the "Big Brother" house.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.990
>> Announcer: And at the head of
household competition, girl

02:00.990 --> 02:01.990
powered ruled.

02:01.990 --> 02:03.700
>> Julie: Congratulations to
Becky.

02:03.700 --> 02:03.990
Congratulations, Shelli.

02:03.990 --> 02:09.990
Are you this week's second head
of household.

02:09.990 --> 02:15.990
>> Announcer: Then, a new bb
takeover kicks off when Kathy

02:15.990 --> 02:18.540
Griffin gives the house a twist.

02:18.540 --> 02:20.950
>> Kathy: I'm going to give one
of you to get the last laugh at

02:20.950 --> 02:22.290
the next eviction.

02:22.290 --> 02:24.990
>> Announcer: Tonight, four new
houseguests go up on the block.

02:24.990 --> 02:28.990
Plus -- Audrey and Da'vonne go
toe to toe.

02:28.990 --> 02:31.990
>> This hit the fan point-blank
end of period.

02:31.990 --> 02:34.990
>> Announcer: All this right now
on "Big Brother."

02:34.990 --> 02:36.990
>> Yeah!

03:16.990 --> 03:17.700
>> Oh, my God.

03:17.700 --> 03:17.990
You did amazing, dude.

03:17.990 --> 03:18.990
You're going to get pictures,
all of it.

03:18.990 --> 03:19.990
You're going to get all your
stuff.

03:19.990 --> 03:22.990
It's going to be amazing.

03:22.990 --> 03:22.990
>> Guess what, guys?

03:22.990 --> 03:24.990
This is the hoh key.

03:24.990 --> 03:25.990
I can't believe it.

03:25.990 --> 03:26.990
I actually won.

03:26.990 --> 03:28.990
I'm really excited.

03:28.990 --> 03:29.990
I'm also nervous.

03:29.990 --> 03:31.990
This key means a whole lot.

03:31.990 --> 03:36.990
>> Who do you think your letter
is going to be from?

03:36.990 --> 03:41.950
>> I'm so excited to be head of
household with Shelli.

03:41.950 --> 03:42.990
I think the world of her.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.990
I'm hoping her and I get some
one-on-one time and can really

03:45.990 --> 03:46.990
make the most out of this game.

03:46.990 --> 03:50.540
>> We're going to be like the
two girls in the tub with the

03:50.540 --> 03:54.990
bikinis on.

03:54.990 --> 03:56.990
>> I'm so stoked that Shelli
just won head of household for

03:56.990 --> 03:58.990
the week because she is the one
person in this game that I trust

03:58.990 --> 04:04.120
the most.

04:04.120 --> 04:08.990
After the fallout with me and
da', da' does not trust

04:08.990 --> 04:16.990
Shelli or myself and never will.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.990
>> So I lost the hoh
competition.

04:19.990 --> 04:24.990
Shelli and Becky are in power.

04:24.990 --> 04:25.990
Yay.

04:25.990 --> 04:26.990
Whoopdy frickin' doo.

04:26.990 --> 04:27.990
I don't trust them.

04:27.990 --> 04:35.990
They're big question marks in my
book.

04:35.990 --> 04:35.990
Ugh!

04:35.990 --> 04:36.990
>> That was so much fun.

04:36.990 --> 04:40.700
After Shelli and Becky win
hoh, there's new power in the

04:40.700 --> 04:40.990
house.

04:40.990 --> 04:42.990
The last 48 hours have been
crazy around here.

04:42.990 --> 04:44.990
The biggest target in the house
right now seems to be Audrey.

04:44.990 --> 04:47.990
It started when Audrey pulled a
bunch of people upstairs and

04:47.990 --> 04:51.990
tried to peg me as this
mastermind of an all girls

04:51.990 --> 04:51.990
alliance.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.410
Was really ridiculous.

04:54.410 --> 04:55.950
>> Vanessa cannot be trusted.

04:55.950 --> 04:57.990
I've been trying to build a a
port with Vanessa to figure out

04:57.990 --> 05:00.990
where the [ Bleep ] she is in
this game.

05:00.990 --> 05:03.990
She instigated the all-girl
alliance.

05:03.990 --> 05:08.000
And I've walked in on her
talking to Becky.

05:08.000 --> 05:08.990
>> Yeah.

05:08.990 --> 05:10.990
I've seen Becky and her talking.

05:10.990 --> 05:15.540
>> She has been working hard
this whole time.

05:15.540 --> 05:19.410
I just want to, like, bring it
to your attention.

05:19.410 --> 05:22.990
I guess there's like a new weird
thing going around like -- it's

05:22.990 --> 05:25.290
like about kind of this girl
click.

05:25.290 --> 05:26.990
>> Oh, really?

05:26.990 --> 05:26.990
Uh-hmm.

05:26.990 --> 05:28.990
You're being associated with
it.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.540
>> Really?

05:30.540 --> 05:30.990
Uh-hmm.

05:30.990 --> 05:35.990
Becky, you, Jackie, Liz.

05:35.990 --> 05:36.990
I'm sorry.

05:36.990 --> 05:37.990
No, you're fine.

05:37.990 --> 05:39.120
Is it working out good?

05:39.120 --> 05:39.990
Yeah, it's good.

05:39.990 --> 05:40.990
Are you shiny?

05:40.990 --> 05:42.990
Yeah.

05:42.990 --> 05:44.990
Dude, you can't even believe
that.

05:44.990 --> 05:49.700
Like --
>> yeah.

05:49.700 --> 05:54.990
Who can -- I can seriously
dispel them of this.

05:54.990 --> 05:59.540
>> It's definitely disconcerting
to say the least that several

05:59.540 --> 06:02.830
people suspect I'm masterminding
this thing that we're not a part

06:02.830 --> 06:03.990
of at all.

06:03.990 --> 06:08.290
>> I just want to let you know
because --

06:08.290 --> 06:11.990
>> like, if that were my doing
in this game, it would be mind

06:11.990 --> 06:15.990
boggling.

06:15.990 --> 06:16.990
It's actually a perfect
opportunity to bring something

06:16.990 --> 06:17.990
up.

06:17.990 --> 06:19.410
Honestly, I like cried this
morning I was so hurt.

06:19.410 --> 06:24.990
You told me da' was the one
who told you that I'm in an all

06:24.990 --> 06:25.990
girls alliance.

06:25.990 --> 06:26.990
>> Did you tell her that?

06:26.990 --> 06:28.990
Let me get this straight.

06:28.990 --> 06:32.990
She comes in here saying she
told you that I told her there

06:32.990 --> 06:34.990
was an all girls alliance.

06:34.990 --> 06:38.990
>> That really did come from
da'.

06:38.990 --> 06:39.990
>> Never said that.

06:39.990 --> 06:41.700
Never said that.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.990
>> I heard what came out of your
mouth.

06:43.990 --> 06:44.830
>> Never said that.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.990
I preesh yacht you coming in
here, though.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.990
>> Look, if you don't trust me,
that's fine.

06:48.990 --> 06:50.990
I we don't have to pretend to be
friends anymore.

06:50.990 --> 06:53.540
>> You never said there was an
all girls alliance and you did

06:53.540 --> 06:56.990
not tell a bunch of people that
you felt like Vanessa was at the

06:56.990 --> 06:57.990
forefront of it.

06:57.990 --> 06:57.990
>> No.

06:57.990 --> 06:58.700
Yes.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.410
Uh-uh.

07:02.410 --> 07:02.990
Let's rally the troops.

07:02.990 --> 07:03.990
Go for it.

07:03.990 --> 07:04.990
You know that's false.

07:04.990 --> 07:10.990
Game on.

07:10.990 --> 07:14.120
I decided to call a house
meeting because it's time get

07:14.120 --> 07:15.990
everything out in the open.

07:15.990 --> 07:18.700
She's done her dirt, and it's
time for everything to hit the

07:18.700 --> 07:18.990
fan.

07:18.990 --> 07:21.000
And I'm tired of it.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.990
Jason, I need you.

07:23.990 --> 07:24.990
>> I hope you're not lying.

07:24.990 --> 07:25.990
I really hope you're not.

07:25.990 --> 07:30.990
>> It's always disappointing
when your game play is exploited

07:30.990 --> 07:31.990
and your back is against the
wall.

07:31.990 --> 07:37.990
I knew that I put myself in a
vulnerable position, and I knew

07:37.990 --> 07:43.120
that it could blow up in my face
should people connect the dots.

07:43.120 --> 07:46.540
And some dots were definitely
connected.

07:46.540 --> 07:46.990
>> I need you.

07:46.990 --> 07:49.540
I need you in my room.

07:49.540 --> 07:51.830
>> I'll be there.

07:51.830 --> 07:52.990
Mama Da' wants to have a
house meeting.

07:52.990 --> 07:53.990
I'm nervous.

07:53.990 --> 07:57.540
I'm not sure what's about to
happen, but I'm ready for it.

07:57.540 --> 08:02.990
>> Did she or did she not rally
up all of you and tell you guys

08:02.990 --> 08:07.990
that Vanessa was at the
forefront of this alliance?

08:07.990 --> 08:10.990
When she woke you guys up at
night what did she say?

08:10.990 --> 08:12.990
>> That Vanessa was the problem.

08:12.990 --> 08:12.990
Okay.

08:12.990 --> 08:15.830
Well, I don't know what else to
say.

08:15.830 --> 08:16.990
You're a [ Bleep ] two-faced.

08:16.990 --> 08:19.990
Seriously, you said it came from
day.

08:19.990 --> 08:22.830
You guys -- are you
pathological.

08:22.830 --> 08:22.990
You really are.

08:22.990 --> 08:24.990
>> You are pathological.

08:24.990 --> 08:26.990
'Re making up these
things, telling one person, then

08:26.990 --> 08:28.990
running to the other person and
acting like the person you just

08:28.990 --> 08:30.990
told is the one who said it.

08:30.990 --> 08:33.990
>> The only person Audrey has
truly been loyal to is herself.

08:33.990 --> 08:35.990
She has overplayed this game.

08:35.990 --> 08:38.990
Everyone in this room witnessing
this knows that Audrey is a

08:38.990 --> 08:41.950
liar.

08:41.950 --> 08:44.990
>> You talked the same amount of
[ Bleep ] about everyone.

08:44.990 --> 08:49.990
>> The difference is that I
don't have a mouthpiece to

08:49.990 --> 08:51.990
validate any [ Bleep ] that
could be coming out of the my

08:51.990 --> 08:53.000
house.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.990
You two do.

08:54.990 --> 08:56.990
>> Her and I talked.

08:56.990 --> 08:59.990
Because of the situation that
happened downstairs right?

08:59.990 --> 09:03.990
Then didn't I tell you she came
to talk to and youcy thought she

09:03.990 --> 09:04.990
did the same thing to you.

09:04.990 --> 09:05.990
She was involved in that, right?

09:05.990 --> 09:08.990
>> Every vehicle there is, the
mistrust between them, the

09:08.990 --> 09:10.990
mistrust between everybody and
Vanessa, all the mistrust in

09:10.990 --> 09:15.990
this whole house has all been
planted by you.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.990
>> Clearly, no matter what I say
is right.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.700
>> The girls thing was
completely from.

09:20.700 --> 09:21.990
>> You it was not from me.

09:21.990 --> 09:23.990
It's a game that she's
playing.

09:23.990 --> 09:26.990
And at the end of the day, when
her ass is gone, they still

09:26.990 --> 09:27.700
here.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.990
And I don't need them coming for
me because of the lies she done

09:31.990 --> 09:31.990
playing.

09:31.990 --> 09:39.990
This has hit the fan,
point-blank, end of period.

09:39.990 --> 09:41.990
>> The last thing I wanted in
the world was for Audrey to be

09:41.990 --> 09:43.990
the most hated person in the
house.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.990
But having a big target in the
house is good for everyone

09:45.990 --> 09:58.410
because it gets us all one week
further.

09:58.410 --> 09:59.990
>> This could have been much
worse.

09:59.990 --> 10:04.410
I thought people were buying
everything that I was telling

10:04.410 --> 10:04.990
them.

10:04.990 --> 10:07.990
But, yeah, that didn't really
work out the way that I hoped.

10:07.990 --> 10:10.950
Right now my back is against the
wall.

10:10.950 --> 10:25.290
And my strategy is just to lie
down and play dead.

10:25.290 --> 10:32.990
>> You think that Audrey feels
like she can get Shelli to side

10:32.990 --> 10:33.000
with her?

10:33.000 --> 10:33.990
>> I don't know.

10:33.990 --> 10:35.000
I don't know.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.120
I was like oh, somebody's going
to set me up.

10:39.120 --> 10:43.990
And that was after the
conversation.

10:43.990 --> 10:47.990
She looked at me, smiled like
gain get put up.

10:47.990 --> 10:50.990
I said by who?

10:50.990 --> 10:53.990
That's the question

10:53.990 --> 10:56.950
it's no secret me and Audrey
are a wrap.

10:56.950 --> 10:56.990
We're done.

10:56.990 --> 11:01.990
But with her and Shelli, it's
not solid, but it's not broken

11:01.990 --> 11:01.990
either.

11:01.990 --> 11:02.990
It's just a little shaky.

11:02.990 --> 11:04.990
I don't know where they stand.

11:04.990 --> 11:08.410
At this point, I kind of feel
like I'm going to get put up on

11:08.410 --> 11:08.990
the block.

11:08.990 --> 11:10.990
If that's the case, bring it,
because I ain't scared of nobody

11:10.990 --> 11:11.990
in here.

11:11.990 --> 11:13.990
This is what I came for.

11:23.990 --> 11:30.990
>> Who wants to see our hoh
room?

11:30.990 --> 11:33.990
Everyone has to come now.

11:33.990 --> 11:35.990
>> Who wants to see my hoh room?

11:35.990 --> 11:37.990
I don't.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.990
>> Yeah!

11:40.990 --> 11:41.120
(Cheers).

11:41.120 --> 11:41.990
>> Oh, my God!

11:41.990 --> 11:43.990
Oh, my God!

11:43.990 --> 11:45.290
Baby pictures.

11:45.290 --> 11:47.990
So embarrassing.

11:47.990 --> 11:51.700
>> Shelli's a beautiful woman,
and seeing her in her clown

11:51.700 --> 11:57.000
costume definitely made my heart
melt just a little more.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.990
>> Dear Becky, don't forget that
you are loved.

11:59.990 --> 12:05.990
Remember to be strong because
you never know who you are

12:05.990 --> 12:06.990
inspiring.

12:06.990 --> 12:07.990
>> Aw.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.540
We are all rooting for you.

12:09.540 --> 12:11.950
With love, Jessie and Ashley.

12:11.950 --> 12:16.990
(Applause)
>> To our sweet, wonderful

12:16.990 --> 12:18.120
Shelli, we are missing you like
crazy.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.830
I hope you are not missing us at
all and are completely focusing

12:21.830 --> 12:21.990
on the game.

12:21.990 --> 12:23.990
I guess you have made some new
friends.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.990
You always do with a winky face.

12:25.990 --> 12:28.700
We all wish you good luck.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.990
We cherish you, mom and dad.

12:30.990 --> 12:31.990
>> Aw!

12:31.990 --> 12:31.990
Mr.Z.

12:31.990 --> 12:36.290
(Applause)
>> The whole time I'm in the

12:36.290 --> 12:39.290
room I'm putting on the
greatest poker face.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.990
I'm smiling.

12:40.990 --> 12:44.990
My inner self is screaming, help
me!

12:44.990 --> 12:45.990
>> Congratulations, ladies.

12:45.990 --> 12:55.990
(Applause)
>> Congratulations.

12:55.990 --> 12:59.540
(Giggling)
>> We haven't talked a lot.

12:59.540 --> 12:59.990
No.

12:59.990 --> 12:59.990
About anything.

12:59.990 --> 13:02.990
So we need to talk about where
you stand, where I stand, like,

13:02.990 --> 13:03.990
I don't even know.

13:03.990 --> 13:05.990
Do you even have any ideas?

13:05.990 --> 13:08.990
>> Obviously, the elephant in
the house.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.120
>> Audrey.

13:10.120 --> 13:10.990
Where do you stand?

13:10.990 --> 13:14.990
I'm nervous to keep her in
this game.

13:14.990 --> 13:18.950
On a personal level, I want her
to not feel unhappy or attacked.

13:18.950 --> 13:23.120
At the same time, I do question
a little bit.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.990
I need to know honestly from you
how you feel and I would respect

13:26.990 --> 13:27.990
any way that you feel about it.

13:27.990 --> 13:30.290
>> I don't know her that well
and I didn't talk game with her.

13:30.290 --> 13:36.990
>> So in my way, we just need to
set four pawns tonight.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.410
>> Four pawns and a back door.

13:38.410 --> 13:39.990
She's the back door.

13:39.990 --> 13:40.410
I'm fine with that.

13:40.410 --> 13:43.990
>> The same thing we did with
Jace last week, we need to

13:43.990 --> 13:44.990
repeat that for Audrey.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.990
>> Obviously, I don't want Clay
to go up.

13:47.990 --> 13:51.990
>> Steve would be a person I
would like to put up.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.700
>> Just kind of ling -- he just
kind of lingers.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.990
>> Who are our other pawns.

13:56.990 --> 13:58.990
I don't know who that person
is right now.

13:58.990 --> 13:59.990
We need ideas.

13:59.990 --> 14:02.410
>> Let's just gather information
and we'll do what's best for

14:02.410 --> 14:02.990
both of us.

14:02.990 --> 14:07.990
>> Okay.

14:07.990 --> 14:13.000
Bviously, no one wants to be
a nominee.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.990
I expect since I put you up last
week so if you want to put me

14:15.990 --> 14:16.990
up, it's okay.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.700
I'm not that worried about it.

14:18.700 --> 14:19.990
>> Okay.

14:19.990 --> 14:24.830
I was considering it.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.990
Can I tell you what it is.

14:26.990 --> 14:28.410
Audrey's going home.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.990
>> And Shelli's onboard.

14:31.990 --> 14:33.990
Basically we were talking
game.

14:33.990 --> 14:40.000
But now that Jason's gone --
Jace is gone, that's it for me.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.990
My biggest worry is being
back-toured like Jace was.

14:43.990 --> 14:46.990
>> As far as the target this
week --

14:46.990 --> 14:47.990
>> it's not me?

14:47.990 --> 14:48.540
Nope.

14:48.540 --> 14:52.290
Not even close.

14:52.290 --> 14:52.990
>> Sorry.

14:52.990 --> 14:54.830
I hope we didn't have issues.

14:54.830 --> 14:57.990
So just try to keep me safe.

14:57.990 --> 14:58.990
>> You're safe.

14:58.990 --> 14:59.990
I like you.

14:59.990 --> 15:02.950
I like you in this game, but I'm
not going to make promises

15:02.950 --> 15:03.990
because I don't know where you
stand.

15:03.990 --> 15:03.990
>> Right.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.990
And I respect where you're at
in the game.

15:05.990 --> 15:12.990
And we all know who's going home
and -- she needs to go.

15:12.990 --> 15:13.990
Between me, you, I like you.

15:13.990 --> 15:14.990
>> All right.

15:14.990 --> 15:17.990
Same here.

15:17.990 --> 15:21.830
>> Okay.

15:21.830 --> 15:23.990
So where's your head at?

15:23.990 --> 15:26.990
Audrey needs to go.

15:26.990 --> 15:28.990
Pretty much people are going to
be pawns part 2.

15:28.990 --> 15:31.990
I'm going to give them the full
chance to get off.

15:31.990 --> 15:34.120
Shelli and I are still decide
who those people are.

15:34.120 --> 15:40.990
I have ideas.

15:40.990 --> 15:43.700
>> You had a very crazy night
and you've had a lot of

15:43.700 --> 15:43.990
information thrown at.

15:43.990 --> 15:44.990
>> You I know.

15:44.990 --> 15:47.950
R head is spinning right
now, I'm sure.

15:47.950 --> 15:49.290
>> That's because there's an
elephant in the house.

15:49.290 --> 15:53.990
We all know who that elephant
is.

15:53.990 --> 15:55.990
>> Are you and Shelli on the
same board with that?

15:55.990 --> 15:56.990
>> So far, yes.

15:56.990 --> 16:01.990
But keep it super, super, super
quiet.

16:01.990 --> 16:03.990
Because stuff changes and next
thing you know, the attention

16:03.990 --> 16:05.990
changed from Audrey --
>> you're asking me not to

16:05.990 --> 16:06.000
repeat this.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.290
That's what you're asking me.

16:07.290 --> 16:07.990
>> Yeah.

16:07.990 --> 16:10.990
I want the attention to stay on
Audrey not on any other --

16:10.990 --> 16:11.990
>> I understand.

16:11.990 --> 16:12.990
-- Anyone in this house.

16:12.990 --> 16:19.120
Okay.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.000
Can we talk?

16:20.000 --> 16:27.990
See, here's the thing.

16:27.990 --> 16:30.990
First off, she walked by, she
walked by the door.

16:30.990 --> 16:35.990
You can't trust -- a word that
comes ow out of Audrey's mouth.

16:35.990 --> 16:39.120
I don't think she'll come after
me, you or Shelli.

16:39.120 --> 16:43.990
If we save her but we've got to
make hear deal.

16:43.990 --> 16:46.990
>> I don't trust Shelli or
myself and never will so we need

16:46.990 --> 16:51.990
to get her out before she comes
after us.

16:51.990 --> 16:56.410
>> Okay.

16:56.410 --> 16:57.540
What's your pick?

16:57.540 --> 17:01.990
Audrey just because just
emotionally, I don't know how

17:01.990 --> 17:02.990
to -- and I would tell that.

17:02.990 --> 17:06.290
I just don't know how to react.

17:06.290 --> 17:10.990
Ever since my blowup with
Da'vonne, I've been basically

17:10.990 --> 17:12.990
laying around playing dead.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.990
So as soon as the opportunity
presents itself for me to have a

17:15.990 --> 17:33.990
talk with Clay and with Jeff, I
will take.

17:33.990 --> 17:34.990
I've hit rock bottom.

17:34.990 --> 17:35.990
I can't go any lower.

17:35.990 --> 17:39.990
So if you give me an opportunity
to show you I'm not going to

17:39.990 --> 17:42.990
target anyone in this group, I'm
going to go for the people that

17:42.990 --> 17:45.990
started all this trouble.

17:45.990 --> 17:50.410
I put on this extreme
performance of repentance.

17:50.410 --> 17:52.990
You know, I am so sorry.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.990
I will shed a tear.

17:54.990 --> 17:58.990
The emmy would definitely go to
me this week.

17:58.990 --> 18:07.830
>> If you want to --
have no one, okay.

18:07.830 --> 18:10.990
So if there's an opportunity for
you to let me prove myself

18:10.990 --> 18:13.990
again, I want to take it.

18:13.990 --> 18:17.120
>> Audrey is basically a master
manipulator.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.830
She's trying to use Clay as her
little puppet and she's

18:20.830 --> 18:23.990
basically exploiting him because
she knows that he's got a big

18:23.990 --> 18:31.990
heart and he thinks with his
emotions.

18:31.990 --> 18:38.700
>> Becky and I talked and we're
targeting Audrey which means

18:38.700 --> 18:39.990
this is too easy.

18:39.990 --> 18:52.990
>> There's no trust in you or --
da' has no trust in you or me.

18:52.990 --> 18:59.540
And if she or Jason wins next
week, she you know damn well

18:59.540 --> 18:59.990
they're putting us up.

18:59.990 --> 19:04.990
>> Clay immediately says to me,
we've got to go after da'.

19:04.990 --> 19:06.990
I'm totally on born because
da' hasn't given me any reason

19:06.990 --> 19:09.990
to trust her in this game and
she's the one I want to see go

19:09.990 --> 19:11.990
home this week.

19:11.990 --> 19:16.290
>> If it were me --
something would happen, I

19:16.290 --> 19:18.990
would never do that.

19:18.990 --> 19:19.990
Clay, I would never do that.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.990
Listen to me.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.990
Da'vonne could pin pov.

19:24.990 --> 19:29.410
Vase Jason could win pov and
they couldic that themselves

19:29.410 --> 19:29.990
off.

19:29.990 --> 19:30.990
I would never do that.

19:30.990 --> 19:32.700
>> What if you do?

19:32.700 --> 19:35.000
I'm backing it whatever it is.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Just want you to know.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.990
>> I need find someone to put up
on the block with da' that

19:41.990 --> 19:45.990
will throw the competition so
that I stay hoh and so I can

19:45.990 --> 19:47.990
send da' home.

19:47.990 --> 19:51.950
>> Put me up.

19:51.950 --> 19:52.990
Vut numbers to do that.

19:52.990 --> 19:55.990
>> The other side of the house
will totally turn around and --

19:55.990 --> 19:57.990
I would never, ever be able to
get over it.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.990
I will not do it.

20:00.990 --> 20:06.990
>> I don't trust --
will not do it.

20:06.990 --> 20:08.990
The only person is John.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.990
John is maybe not that strong of
a competitor.

20:11.990 --> 20:13.290
>> Who's going to throw it?

20:13.290 --> 20:15.990
He will not throw a
competition.

20:15.990 --> 20:16.950
He will not.

20:16.950 --> 20:21.290
The only reason why John won the
Bob last time is because Becky

20:21.290 --> 20:23.990
killed it.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.990
>> In order it ensure that I
stay head of household this

20:25.990 --> 20:29.990
week, I'm going to need to put a
pawn up against Da'vonne to

20:29.990 --> 20:31.990
make sure that they throw the
battle of the block and then

20:31.990 --> 20:38.540
that will leave me in control
this week.

20:38.540 --> 20:38.990
Come here.

20:38.990 --> 20:41.290
>> What do you want to do?

20:41.290 --> 20:44.990
Okay.

20:44.990 --> 20:45.990
Do you have anybody that you
trust that you want to keep in

20:45.990 --> 20:46.990
this game?

20:46.990 --> 20:47.830
>> Becky.

20:47.830 --> 20:48.990
Perfect.

20:48.990 --> 20:48.990
Great.

20:48.990 --> 20:49.990
Anybody else?

20:49.990 --> 20:50.990
This guy.

20:50.990 --> 20:51.120
At's perfect.

20:51.120 --> 20:55.700
You have loyalty on the people
that we are with, okay?

20:55.700 --> 20:58.700
We are asking you because we
feel like we can trust you.

20:58.700 --> 21:01.950
If you go up there on the block
with da'.

21:01.950 --> 21:01.990
>> We want you to throw it.

21:01.990 --> 21:05.990
Ill you throw the Bob, don't
win it.

21:05.990 --> 21:13.990
>> If I give you my word, when I
say that we want you on our team

21:13.990 --> 21:16.990
and if I didn't mean something,
and you will not go home if you

21:16.990 --> 21:19.990
lose this competition, you will
not go home becausely do

21:19.990 --> 21:24.540
everything in my power to hold
my word and if we think you'll

21:24.540 --> 21:28.290
go home, I will mess up my own
game to keep my own word for

21:28.290 --> 21:28.950
you.

21:28.950 --> 21:29.290
I mean that.

21:29.290 --> 21:31.700
>> There are so many things
running through my head.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.990
Why do I have to be the pawn?

21:33.990 --> 21:35.290
Why can't Clay be the pawn?

21:35.290 --> 21:38.990
It's like, guys, do you not like
my face or something?

21:38.990 --> 21:40.990
You just want to throw mow up
there as a pawn every week?

21:40.990 --> 21:45.700
I don't even play chess!

21:45.700 --> 21:48.950
>> We will keep our word and
make sure that you're --

21:48.950 --> 21:49.290
>> it's a tough call.

21:49.290 --> 21:51.990
Like, am I going to help these
people and keep looking like I'm

21:51.990 --> 21:54.990
really bad at competitions or am
I going to save myself to make

21:54.990 --> 21:55.990
sure I live through the week?

21:55.990 --> 21:58.990
I just don't know which way I
want to go.

21:58.990 --> 22:00.990
>> Are you okay with it?

22:09.990 --> 22:14.120
Be a fly on the wall inside
the Big Brother house

22:14.120 --> 22:16.120
watch the houseguests anytime
with the live feed CBS.Com

22:25.990 --> 22:28.700
>> I was afraid to talk to
people when I was younger.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.990
It was so scary.

22:30.990 --> 22:34.120
Even now in the "Big Brother"
house, it's intimidating.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.990
>> We are roommates at this
point.

22:35.990 --> 22:35.990
We're live together.

22:35.990 --> 22:40.000
So eventually everyone's life
stories will be out there for

22:40.000 --> 22:40.990
everyone.

22:40.990 --> 22:41.990
>> I have a thing to tell you,
you guys.

22:41.990 --> 22:43.990
>> Oh, my gosh.

22:43.990 --> 22:46.990
I got hit by a train last
year while I was walking.

22:46.990 --> 22:50.990
>> You got hit by a --
a train.

22:50.990 --> 22:53.120
On a track?

22:53.120 --> 22:54.290
I don't understand.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.990
How did it hit you?

22:55.990 --> 22:56.540
>> It was 6:00 A.M.

22:56.540 --> 22:56.990
It was dark out.

22:56.990 --> 22:59.950
And I had had my hood up.

22:59.950 --> 23:03.990
And right at the corner where I
cross the street is a big van,

23:03.990 --> 23:07.830
and I had walked in front of it
and put my head out.

23:07.830 --> 23:09.990
>> Oh, my God.

23:09.990 --> 23:10.290
!

23:10.290 --> 23:11.410
A train in the face.

23:11.410 --> 23:13.830
The whole front of the train.

23:13.830 --> 23:16.990
The whole front of the train
literally as I put my face out

23:16.990 --> 23:23.990
behind and I landed like 15 feet
from -- of course, I'm knocked

23:23.990 --> 23:23.990
out.

23:23.990 --> 23:27.120
I broke this part of my leg and
from the land.

23:27.120 --> 23:31.990
These two broke off, went
through this lip.

23:31.990 --> 23:33.990
This lip this to be sewn back
on.

23:33.990 --> 23:37.540
My nose was crushed, fractured
now skull and I was out of work

23:37.540 --> 23:39.990
for eight weeks.

23:39.990 --> 23:41.990
Full recovery, no plastic
surgery.

23:41.990 --> 23:43.990
>> No, no, no.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.830
No way!

23:45.830 --> 23:48.990
>> Becky getting hit by a train
is the most insane thing ever.

23:48.990 --> 23:53.290
That chick is superhume fln are
you -- human.

23:53.290 --> 23:54.990
>> Are you leery of trains?

23:54.990 --> 23:58.700
It changed my whole
perspective.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.990
I spent more time with my
family, started going to church

24:01.990 --> 24:04.990
again, had a relationship with
my grandma and I calmed the.

24:04.990 --> 24:05.990
[ Bleep ] Down.

24:05.990 --> 24:06.990
I work at the same school.

24:06.990 --> 24:08.700
I'm your basic bitch.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.990
(Laughter)
I really am.

24:10.990 --> 24:14.990
>> I have never heard in my life
of a girl to get hit in the face

24:14.990 --> 24:16.990
with a train.

24:16.990 --> 24:19.990
Someone that can take a train to
the face is definitely someone I

24:19.990 --> 24:22.990
can see myself aligning with and
definitely working with in this

24:22.990 --> 24:27.990
game.

24:27.990 --> 24:32.990
>> So when you see a trainwreck,
just think of me.

24:32.990 --> 24:39.290
(Choo-choo)
>> Have a good night.

24:39.290 --> 24:40.990
I'm going to bed.

24:40.990 --> 24:51.990
>> Been, bro'.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.700
Lucky dog, you.

24:53.700 --> 24:58.000
This will be a first for me.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.830
Enjoy it, man.

24:59.830 --> 25:13.990
I -- I don't intend on
utilizing it.

25:13.990 --> 25:14.120
.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.990
>> My responsibility as the
heads of households is to each

25:16.990 --> 25:22.990
nominate two people for
eviction.

25:22.990 --> 25:25.990
>> If the goal is to send me
home, my best bet is to get put

25:25.990 --> 25:31.990
up so, in a way, I kind of want
me be nominated today.

25:31.990 --> 25:35.990
It's crazy.

25:35.990 --> 25:39.990
>> Going into this nomination
ceremony, I'm a little on the

25:39.990 --> 25:41.990
edge of my seat.

25:41.990 --> 25:43.990
There's some bad blood between
me and half of the house.

25:43.990 --> 25:51.120
I will never, ever completely
feel safe.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.990
>> Going into this nomination
ceremony, I'm really worried

25:54.990 --> 25:57.410
they're going to tell me
something to my face but

25:57.410 --> 25:58.990
outgoing hoh, I'm not in power
anymore.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.990
So I'm feeling right now that I
went from bel air to the trailer

26:01.990 --> 26:06.540
park.

26:06.540 --> 26:09.990
>> Going into this nomination
ceremony, I think Becky's going

26:09.990 --> 26:13.950
to put me up because we had a
real awkward vibe during our

26:13.950 --> 26:13.990
conversation.

26:13.990 --> 26:16.990
I know I'm not her target but
I'd rather not go up anyway just

26:16.990 --> 26:20.990
because pawns do go home.

26:20.990 --> 26:23.990
>> I'm nervous for nominations,
because in this game, you never

26:23.990 --> 26:24.990
really know.

26:24.990 --> 26:28.700
I put Becky up last week, so
it's very easy for her to put me

26:28.700 --> 26:30.990
up this week.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.540
>> This is the nomination
ceremony.

26:50.540 --> 26:54.990
It is our responsibility as the
heads of households to nominate

26:54.990 --> 26:58.990
two houseguests for eviction.

26:58.990 --> 27:13.990
The first houseguest I have
nominated is --

27:13.990 --> 27:25.290
the next houseguest I have
nominated is --

27:25.290 --> 27:29.990
I have nominated you, John, and
you Da'vonne.

27:29.990 --> 27:33.990
Da', you don't intend to trust
me in this game so I'm simply

27:33.990 --> 27:35.540
protecting myself.

27:35.540 --> 27:39.540
It's not easy to choose anybody
but that's what we have to do as

27:39.540 --> 27:42.290
heads of households.

27:42.290 --> 27:57.990
>> The first houseguest I have
nominated is --

27:57.990 --> 28:10.990
the second houseguest I have
nominated is --

28:10.990 --> 28:15.120
I have nominated you, Jason, and
you, Steve.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.990
Jason, you put me on the block
the first week and you wished me

28:17.990 --> 28:17.990
the best luck.

28:17.990 --> 28:21.120
So I wish you that same luck
this week.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.990
Steve, you're a great guy in
this house but we haven't talked

28:23.990 --> 28:24.990
a lot of game.

28:24.990 --> 28:26.990
I can't wait to see what happens
this week.

28:26.990 --> 28:36.410
This nomination ceremony is
adjourned.

28:36.410 --> 28:36.990
>> Nominations are over.

28:36.990 --> 28:39.990
And I didn't get noted.

28:39.990 --> 28:41.410
I'm ecstatic.

28:41.410 --> 28:46.990
But someone could have a secret
agenda that involves me going

28:46.990 --> 28:52.990
out the back door.

28:52.990 --> 28:55.990
>> We successfully have four
pawns onto the block.

28:55.990 --> 28:59.990
Now all we have to do is wait
for Audrey to get backdoored.

28:59.990 --> 29:03.830
>> I know that Becky thinks that
I'm going to be on board to

29:03.830 --> 29:04.540
backdoor Audrey this week.

29:04.540 --> 29:06.990
But my main plan is to get rid
of Da'vonne first.

29:06.990 --> 29:09.290
I really hope that this works
out for me, because this is a

29:09.290 --> 29:14.410
big move that could be super,
super risky for my game.

29:14.410 --> 29:16.990
>> Right now the plan to get out
Da'vonne is in full effect.

29:16.990 --> 29:19.990
I'm really happy that Shelli
trusts me enough to actually

29:19.990 --> 29:22.950
consider my opinion and put up
Da'vonne on the block.

29:22.950 --> 29:34.830
She is the biggest threat to
Shelli's game as well as mine.

29:34.830 --> 29:34.990
>> That's rough.

29:34.990 --> 29:35.990
Let's do it again.

29:35.990 --> 29:38.990
>> I need to win this battle of
block so I can secure my safety

29:38.990 --> 29:40.990
because next week I got a hit
list and I'm checking them off

29:40.990 --> 29:46.990
one by one.

29:46.990 --> 29:47.990
>> We need some cookies.

29:53.990 --> 29:57.290
Can't get enough Big Brother?
There is never a dull moment

29:57.290 --> 29:59.990
see what's happening inside the
house whenever you want

29:59.990 --> 30:01.990
with the live feeds on CBS.Com

30:03.540 --> 30:04.540
you know you want to watch!

30:13.950 --> 30:18.950
How the hell did Audrey not
get on the block?

30:18.950 --> 30:20.990
>> They plan on backdooring her.

30:20.990 --> 30:22.120
We're the target.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.990
>> We've been the target since
last week.

30:23.990 --> 30:24.990
>> Because we actually opened
our mouth.

30:24.990 --> 30:25.990
>> Oh, man.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.990
Audrey should have been
everybody's target, everybody.

30:28.990 --> 30:36.990
So this one week we should have
united as a house and got this

30:36.990 --> 30:38.990
chick up outta here!

30:38.990 --> 30:44.990
>> This chick lied to your face
and got proven to be a liar, and

30:44.990 --> 30:45.990
you can't trust me?

30:45.990 --> 30:48.990
>> Both of us are possible
targets for this week.

30:48.990 --> 30:52.990
Da'vonne and myself have both
showed that we're not afraid to

30:52.990 --> 30:53.540
snatch a wig.

30:53.540 --> 30:56.990
This week with a full-blown
assault against me and

30:56.990 --> 30:57.990
Da'vonne.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.990
>> Neither one of us is going
nowhere.

31:00.990 --> 31:10.990
We going to get that.

31:10.990 --> 31:13.990
>> Do you know who the target
is?

31:13.990 --> 31:14.950
>> Audrey.

31:14.950 --> 31:15.990
We have a mutual target.

31:15.990 --> 31:17.990
I know this is a lot of
speculation.

31:17.990 --> 31:20.990
>> Okay.

31:20.990 --> 31:26.990
I am cheering for you guys.

31:26.990 --> 31:29.990
T should be an easy week for
both Steve and Jason.

31:29.990 --> 31:32.950
It seems like the whole house is
after the same person, so as

31:32.950 --> 31:35.990
long as they lay low, everything
should go very smoothly for

31:35.990 --> 31:44.540
them.

31:44.540 --> 31:45.990
>> We got a squirrel running
around the house.

31:45.990 --> 31:48.990
And I want to get the squirrel
out of here.

31:48.990 --> 31:52.990
>> Becky tells me the big plan
in motion is supposedly to

31:52.990 --> 31:56.990
backdoor aud aw Audrey but I
don't think anybody is 100%

31:56.990 --> 31:57.290
believing that at this point.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.990
I want to win battle of the
block so I can ensure that I am

31:59.990 --> 32:08.990
safe.

32:08.990 --> 32:10.000
(Ding dong).

32:10.000 --> 32:10.990
>> Who's that?

32:10.990 --> 32:11.990
At's up?

32:11.990 --> 32:13.700
Am I interrupting?

32:13.700 --> 32:17.950
No, we just saw you walk
over.

32:17.950 --> 32:20.950
>> Can I ask you one question?

32:20.950 --> 32:22.990
And then I'll just --
>> just one.

32:22.990 --> 32:22.990
Okay.

32:22.990 --> 32:24.990
Yeah, you only got one
question so --

32:24.990 --> 32:24.990
>> okay.

32:24.990 --> 32:28.990
Is there a plan "b" if for some
reason Steve or Jason throws

32:28.990 --> 32:39.410
their competition?

32:39.410 --> 32:42.990
>> It's not my business to tell
her what Becky's plan is.

32:42.990 --> 32:45.700
God, how bad would that be for
my game if I told Audrey

32:45.700 --> 32:47.700
something and then she let
somebody else know and the way

32:47.700 --> 32:49.990
that the whole house is against
her, then that would totally

32:49.990 --> 32:59.290
blow up and Shelli would be
going home.

32:59.290 --> 33:00.990
>> I'm not talking to you
tonight.

33:00.990 --> 33:05.990
Good night.

33:05.990 --> 33:06.700
>> Okay.

33:06.700 --> 33:06.990
Good night.

33:06.990 --> 33:07.990
>> You okay?

33:07.990 --> 33:09.990
Eah, I'm fine.

33:09.990 --> 33:12.990
I expected it.

33:12.990 --> 33:14.990
>> I don't know if I'm going to
sleep tonight.

33:14.990 --> 33:15.990
I'm going to try.

33:15.990 --> 33:17.120
We got to sleep somehow.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.990
We can't be groggy tomorrow.

33:20.990 --> 33:24.540
We got to be full on fierce.

33:24.540 --> 33:26.990
So throwing this competition is
going to get me a bunch of new

33:26.990 --> 33:28.990
people to work with.

33:28.990 --> 33:31.990
But at this point, I'm really
not sure if I should throw the

33:31.990 --> 33:41.990
battle of the block, but it's
like --

33:41.990 --> 33:42.990
>> brush your teeth.

33:42.990 --> 33:43.290
Yeah.

33:43.290 --> 33:45.990
All right?

33:45.990 --> 33:45.990
Yeah.

33:45.990 --> 33:47.990
That's going to go out the
window.

33:47.990 --> 33:51.990
I'm sorry, Da'vonne, had is
going to be the worst injection

33:51.990 --> 33:52.990
of all time.

33:52.990 --> 33:56.990
Boom, right in the gum and bam!

33:56.990 --> 33:57.990
The pain hurts.

34:10.950 --> 34:11.990
>> Red alert!

34:11.990 --> 34:15.990
It's time for the battle of the
block competition!

34:15.990 --> 34:17.990
>> Oh, my God.

34:17.990 --> 34:20.990
Are you kidding?

34:20.990 --> 34:28.990
>> Get changed and report to the
ginger fever set.

34:28.990 --> 34:31.990
>> Woo!

34:31.990 --> 34:35.990
Yeah.

34:35.990 --> 34:37.990
When I walk into the yard, I
see cameras.

34:37.990 --> 34:38.990
I see props.

34:38.990 --> 34:43.290
And I realize, ah, we're on a TV
set.

34:43.290 --> 34:44.990
Well, these people are looking
for drama.

34:44.990 --> 34:46.990
They've come to the right house.

34:46.990 --> 34:50.290
>> Welcome to "Big Brother"
studios.

34:50.290 --> 34:57.410
Today you'll be camera operators
for "ginger fever."

34:57.410 --> 35:00.540
Becky's nominees will battle
Shelli's nominees to save

35:00.540 --> 35:02.990
themselves from the chopping
block.

35:02.990 --> 35:06.990
The winning pair not only earns
safety for the rest of the week

35:06.990 --> 35:10.990
but will dethrone the hoh that
nominated them.

35:10.990 --> 35:15.990
When I yell "action," the
director's shot list will start

35:15.990 --> 35:17.000
flashing on the video monitor.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.990
Your job is to match your shot
list to your screen.

35:21.990 --> 35:26.990
Shot 1 on screen 1, shot 2 on
screen 2, and so on.

35:26.990 --> 35:28.290
How are you going to do this?

35:28.290 --> 35:31.990
You're going to use your cameras
to find the props on the set.

35:31.990 --> 35:35.990
The trick is that you don't know
which cameras are wired to which

35:35.990 --> 35:37.830
screen.

35:37.830 --> 35:41.120
The first team to get all nine
shots correct and hit their

35:41.120 --> 35:44.990
button wins the battle of the
block.

35:44.990 --> 35:52.990
Who's ready to play get me
props?!

35:52.990 --> 35:53.290
(Applause).

35:53.290 --> 35:53.990
>> Yeah.

35:53.990 --> 35:54.990
Yeah.

35:54.990 --> 35:56.990
>> I went from being on the
block to the person in control

35:56.990 --> 35:58.990
of the block.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.990
Knowing that Shelli and I are
going after the same person this

36:01.990 --> 36:05.990
week has really taken a lot of
the stress of a uoff of me.

36:05.990 --> 36:09.830
If I'm dethroned, Shelli is
still going to target Audrey and

36:09.830 --> 36:10.990
get the blood on her hands.

36:10.990 --> 36:13.990
>> Becky thinks that my plans
will is to backdoor Audrey, but

36:13.990 --> 36:15.990
really my plan to sto get
Da'vonne out.

36:15.990 --> 36:18.990
So I'll hoping that John is
going to pull off this plan to

36:18.990 --> 36:20.990
throw the battle of the block.

36:20.990 --> 36:23.990
>> This is like the toughest
decision I've had to make in

36:23.990 --> 36:24.990
here yet.

36:24.990 --> 36:27.830
I can try to win this thing and
I'm just safe for the week and I

36:27.830 --> 36:28.990
don't have to worry about it.

36:28.990 --> 36:32.990
Or I could throw this battle
bmgt and -- battle of the block

36:32.990 --> 36:38.990
and I will help people in power.

36:38.990 --> 36:42.990
>> Kathy wants you to bond
together so she sent over these

36:42.990 --> 36:43.120
outfits.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.990
>> John and I get told that we
have to put on this uniform and

36:45.990 --> 36:52.990
kind of be like seem ease
twins -- siamese twins worked at

36:52.990 --> 36:53.990
the hip.

36:53.990 --> 36:56.990
I work as a solo art pitch I
hate doing things in pairs, in

36:56.990 --> 36:59.990
teams, in twos.

36:59.990 --> 37:05.990
>> This is definitely the most
action I've had in months.

37:05.990 --> 37:06.990
I'll take it.

37:06.990 --> 37:14.990
>> Lights, camera, action!

37:14.990 --> 37:18.990
The shot lists start
flashing.

37:18.990 --> 37:21.990
>> 1 gumball.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.120
2 --
>> first shot is a gumball jar.

37:23.120 --> 37:27.990
The second shot is a doctor
squirrel.

37:27.990 --> 37:30.950
Our strategy is to start with
two cameras and we happened to

37:30.950 --> 37:33.540
get lucky because the first two
cameras we put on are shots 1

37:33.540 --> 37:36.990
and 2.

37:36.990 --> 37:36.990
>> Okay.

37:36.990 --> 37:38.990
So this is 2 and then 1.

37:38.990 --> 37:44.830
>> And then we point our cameras
at the gumball jar and

37:44.830 --> 37:44.990
Dr. squirrel.

37:44.990 --> 37:47.990
By only opening two cameras at a
time we won't get confused on

37:47.990 --> 37:56.990
which camera matches which shot.

37:56.990 --> 38:00.990
>> Running around.

38:00.990 --> 38:03.990
First thing we're going to do
is open up all the lenses on the

38:03.990 --> 38:08.410
cameras so that we can see what
they're actually looking at.

38:08.410 --> 38:10.990
Two, we did back to the shot
list to decide which items we

38:10.990 --> 38:12.990
want to go ahead and find.

38:12.990 --> 38:16.540
Step three, we run back to the
cameras and point them at the

38:16.540 --> 38:16.990
random items.

38:16.990 --> 38:21.990
And then fourth, we run back to
the main screen to make sure we

38:21.990 --> 38:26.990
accurately zoomed in on that
item.

38:26.990 --> 38:30.410
>> Da'vonne comes up with this
strategy to first run around and

38:30.410 --> 38:30.990
open every.

38:30.990 --> 38:34.990
I'm like, this is the dumbest
strategy that you could possibly

38:34.990 --> 38:37.700
do for this competition.

38:37.700 --> 38:40.990
I'm going to be able to throw
this thing no problem.

38:40.990 --> 38:41.990
Sounds good.

38:41.990 --> 38:43.990
I'm on board.

38:43.990 --> 38:44.990
>> Wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.410
Did you see what it was?

38:46.410 --> 38:46.990
>> No.

38:46.990 --> 38:50.990
Okay.

38:50.990 --> 38:51.990
This one.

38:51.990 --> 38:51.990
>> Okay.

38:51.990 --> 38:52.990
Let's go.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.990
Come on, da'.

38:54.990 --> 38:57.990
Daven's strategy is so bad,
like she's throwing it for me

38:57.990 --> 38:59.990
and I don't even have to worry
about it.

38:59.990 --> 39:00.990
>> Okay.

39:00.990 --> 39:05.990
This one.

39:05.990 --> 39:08.990
>> We have our first two cameras
set, so we're going to open two

39:08.990 --> 39:13.290
more cameras, run back to our
monitor and see what two shots

39:13.290 --> 39:16.990
those correspond with.

39:16.990 --> 39:23.990
>> Run back to the monitor and
see that 4 corresponds with the

39:23.990 --> 39:26.990
demonstration heart and 7 is a
massage oil.

39:26.990 --> 39:27.990
>> The demonstration heart?

39:27.990 --> 39:28.990
Yeah.

39:28.990 --> 39:30.990
Where the hell is massage
oil?

39:30.990 --> 39:30.990
Right here.

39:30.990 --> 39:33.000
>> Got it.

39:33.000 --> 39:33.990
(Ding).

39:33.990 --> 39:36.990
>> And repeat this is th is
actually simple.

39:36.990 --> 39:37.990
>> Okay.

39:37.990 --> 39:38.990
Careful, careful.

39:38.990 --> 39:39.000
Okay.

39:39.000 --> 39:39.990
Here.

39:39.990 --> 39:44.950
>> At this point, I'm noticing
John is just kind of there.

39:44.950 --> 39:44.990
He's not helping.

39:44.990 --> 39:45.990
He's not doing anything.

39:45.990 --> 39:49.990
I'm kind of just pulling him
along.

39:49.990 --> 39:51.830
I have to win.

39:51.830 --> 39:53.990
So at this point, I'm just kind
of like dragging him.

39:53.990 --> 39:56.990
I'm running to each camera.

39:56.990 --> 39:57.990
He's sliding.

39:57.990 --> 40:00.410
He's, hold on, hold on.

40:00.410 --> 40:00.990
No!

40:00.990 --> 40:04.990
Pick up, catch up!

40:04.990 --> 40:06.950
>> Gold pick.

40:06.950 --> 40:08.990
Over there, over there.

40:08.990 --> 40:14.990
Kay.

40:14.990 --> 40:14.990
Dr. squirrel.

40:14.990 --> 40:24.990
You got this, guys.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.990
Oversized mass crad and
squirrel.

40:26.990 --> 40:27.990
>> Killing it.

40:27.990 --> 40:28.990
Where is it?

40:28.990 --> 40:29.990
Right over here.

40:29.990 --> 40:39.990
Got it.

40:39.990 --> 40:44.950
(Ding)
>> Oh.

40:44.950 --> 40:46.120
Okay.

40:46.120 --> 40:49.120
>> John and Da'vonne are doing
so terribly right now, it looks

40:49.120 --> 41:02.990
like my master plan might
actually be coming together.

41:02.990 --> 41:03.990
>> X-ray screen.

41:03.990 --> 41:05.990
Not until you press your
button are you sure that you

41:05.990 --> 41:06.700
have this correct.

41:06.700 --> 41:09.990
So I'm hoping that me and Steve
have all these cameras

41:09.990 --> 41:23.950
positioned correctly.

41:23.950 --> 41:23.990
(Ding).

41:23.990 --> 41:24.990
>> Congratulations, Jason and
Steve.

41:24.990 --> 41:25.990
>> Yeah!

41:25.990 --> 41:27.990
Ou have won the battle of
the block.

41:27.990 --> 41:29.540
Are you now safe for this week.

41:29.540 --> 41:33.990
>> It feels so you asol to have
won the battle of the block.

41:33.990 --> 41:36.990
My plan is to do anything I can
to try to save Da'vonne.

41:36.990 --> 41:38.990
This is definitely crunch time.

41:38.990 --> 41:42.990
And I'm not giving up just yet.

41:42.990 --> 41:45.990
>> Shelli is still head of
household this week.

41:45.990 --> 41:46.990
My plan is in action.

41:46.990 --> 41:48.990
And we're going to be sending
Da'vonne out the tour.

41:48.990 --> 41:52.990
I'm sorry, Becky, but it looks
like your backdoor plan is about

41:52.990 --> 41:54.990
to take an unexpected turn.

41:54.990 --> 41:54.990
(Applause).

41:54.990 --> 41:56.000
>> All right!

41:56.000 --> 41:57.990
Yes!

41:57.990 --> 42:02.990
Unfortunately, Becky, you are
no longer a head of household.

42:02.990 --> 42:07.990
You're losing power, but gaining
powder.

42:07.990 --> 42:08.990
>> Oh!

42:08.990 --> 42:12.990
(Laughter)
>> I'm getting everything I

42:12.990 --> 42:12.990
want.

42:12.990 --> 42:15.700
I have my new relationships in
the house.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.990
My pawns are happy as can be.

42:17.990 --> 42:20.000
And Shelli will be taking out my
target for me.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.990
I expect all hell to break loose
in the house like it always

42:22.990 --> 42:23.990
does.

42:23.990 --> 42:31.950
I don't have to take care of any
of it.

42:31.950 --> 42:31.990
>> This is awesome.

42:31.990 --> 42:36.990
I literally did nothing to throw
this, which is kind of

42:36.990 --> 42:38.990
consistent with the rest of my
strategy so far.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.990
It's beautiful.

42:40.990 --> 42:46.120
>> If I get kicked out, so be
it, but I have to win this veto

42:46.120 --> 42:47.990
by any means necessary.

42:47.990 --> 42:53.700
I don't give a damn if I got to
break my toes, my legs, my

42:53.700 --> 42:53.990
kneecaps.

42:53.990 --> 42:57.990
Otherwise they're going to send
me home.

42:57.990 --> 43:00.990
>> Announcer: Who will win the
power of veto?

43:00.990 --> 43:03.990
And will it be used to save
either John or Da'vonne from

43:03.990 --> 43:05.990
eviction?

43:05.990 --> 43:07.990

8/7 central on "Big Brother."
