01:25.516 --> 01:26.520
All right, miss?

01:29.576 --> 01:31.536
Sergeant Drake. Miss Rose.

01:33.556 --> 01:35.576
Such a beautiful posy, Sergeant.

01:36.580 --> 01:40.503
There's a, there's nothing's
more lovely than a rose.

01:40.504 --> 01:43.520
I, er... I took the liberty
of purchasing tickets.

01:44.596 --> 01:46.551
Sergeant!

01:46.805 --> 01:47.832
Please.

01:47.833 --> 01:49.804
Call me Bennet.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.793
Well, Bennet. Shall we?

02:13.443 --> 02:43.526
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

02:45.506 --> 02:46.522
It's so romantic!

02:47.534 --> 02:49.497
But, they die.

02:49.498 --> 02:51.498
Yeah! Of wild passions!

02:52.502 --> 02:56.533
"Where souls do couch on flowers,
we'll hand in hand.

02:56.534 --> 03:01.525
"And with our sprightly port
make the ghosts gaze..."

03:01.526 --> 03:03.546
You could be an actress, Miss Rose.

03:03.547 --> 03:05.481
Do you think so?

03:05.482 --> 03:08.501
Well, I'm sure of it,
if such would please.

03:08.502 --> 03:12.480
I knew a girl, Peggy, worked on
her back from ten years of age,

03:12.481 --> 03:15.492
fell in with a company of players
and toured continents!

03:15.493 --> 03:17.514
They showered petals on her, Bennet!

03:17.515 --> 03:20.457
What, so she done acting
instead of...

03:20.458 --> 03:22.517
That is... work on her back?

03:22.518 --> 03:25.464
Yeah. But on her back till
she met her gentleman.

03:25.465 --> 03:27.538
An actress needs a patron, silly.

03:27.539 --> 03:30.461
Ah, look!

03:30.462 --> 03:33.513
Lovebirds, they are, miss.
Very friendly.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.469
And, may I say,
good with children...

03:36.470 --> 03:38.474
Should such be a consideration.

03:39.514 --> 03:41.513
I mean no harm, of course.

03:41.514 --> 03:43.529
But, er... listen, Mr, er...?

03:43.530 --> 03:45.534
What do they call you by, good sir?

03:45.535 --> 03:47.545
Drake. Mr Drake!

03:47.546 --> 03:50.485
Why, a Drake's a duck, is it not?

03:50.486 --> 03:52.529
You're practically related!

03:52.530 --> 03:54.466
Birds of a feather.

03:55.478 --> 03:56.538
They're adorable, Bennet.

03:59.454 --> 04:00.469
How much?

04:00.470 --> 04:01.486
Ten and six.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.497
And for just one?

04:05.498 --> 04:07.517
You can't part 'em, sir.

04:07.518 --> 04:09.466
They's lovebirds!

04:10.494 --> 04:12.506
See how the good lady's
taken a shine.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.476
Never mind, Bennet.

04:16.478 --> 04:17.482
Sergeant!

04:18.502 --> 04:21.512
Pardon me, miss... I didn't realise
that the Sergeant was, erm...

04:21.512 --> 04:22.534
What is it, boy?

04:22.535 --> 04:24.473
It's my afternoon off.

04:24.474 --> 04:25.538
The Inspector, he needs you.

04:25.539 --> 04:27.462
It's urgent, like.

04:30.454 --> 04:33.506
I'm sorry, Rose, I better go,
I'll see you around.

04:48.522 --> 04:51.465
Drilled clean through again?

04:51.466 --> 04:53.494
You needn't have dressed up,
Sergeant.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.536
Same crew as
Rob Wheen & Harker Insurance?

04:58.537 --> 05:01.500
If it is so, I fear what else
lurks in their arsenal.

05:01.501 --> 05:05.494
Chloroform for the driver, smoke
bombs in the street and now, this...

05:06.518 --> 05:08.546
Advertisement for these
in the Evening Post.

05:08.547 --> 05:10.505
"Guaranteed blast-proof."

05:10.506 --> 05:11.534
Caveat emptor.

05:12.542 --> 05:14.498
That ain't black powder. What is it?

05:14.499 --> 05:17.457
What indeed. Jackson's en route.

05:17.458 --> 05:19.484
Haul of gemstones, Hobbs said.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.532
Struck a lot luckier this time,
didn't they?

05:21.533 --> 05:23.480
Luck? The carriage is unmarked.

05:23.481 --> 05:27.452
The jeweller changes his route every
week. Nobody's that lucky.

05:27.453 --> 05:28.518
What, someone tipped 'em?

05:28.519 --> 05:32.485
Or they had the wit to find
what they needed to know.

05:32.486 --> 05:35.516
Right between the eyes,
at movement, from a rooftop.

05:35.517 --> 05:37.524
Could you have made that shot,
Sergeant?

05:37.525 --> 05:39.548
I can't rightly say, sir.
I was never a marksman.

05:39.549 --> 05:41.528
But you'd need to be... Hobbs!

05:41.529 --> 05:44.512
Hobbs, I need this scene examined
before the street's cleared.

05:44.513 --> 05:46.474
Where in hell is that Yankee?

05:46.475 --> 05:49.525
It, it seems he's... refused
to rouse, sir.

05:49.526 --> 05:50.530
What?!

05:51.538 --> 05:54.481
I want that man
dragged from his rank pit,

05:54.482 --> 05:56.478
trussed if need be. Yes, sir.

05:59.454 --> 06:00.458
Fetch a saw.

06:02.474 --> 06:03.520
I had a headache.

06:03.521 --> 06:06.468
Needed the soothing attentions
of a fair maiden's hand.

06:06.469 --> 06:09.476
Jackson, when I send for you,
you will come or else I shall...

06:09.477 --> 06:11.500
Else you'll do a thing
and lock me in a place

06:11.501 --> 06:13.524
and drop me on my so forth
and what have you, right?

06:13.525 --> 06:16.530
Smokescreen was potassium chlorate,
by the way. Excuse me.

06:19.514 --> 06:23.550
Bicarb moderator so the crates
didn't burn. Nice enough work.

06:23.551 --> 06:28.485
How they blew the safe, however,
to that, I doff my bowler.

06:28.486 --> 06:29.532
It's not gunpowder, is it?

06:29.533 --> 06:31.522
Gunpowder wouldn't even
dent that box.

06:31.523 --> 06:34.493
Nitroglycerine? Trinitrotoluene?

06:34.494 --> 06:36.510
No, makes a bang,
but it's a bitch to detonate.

06:36.511 --> 06:38.521
Then what? Search me.

06:38.522 --> 06:42.517
Say it isn't so... Our noble surgeon
stumped and stymied.

06:42.518 --> 06:44.522
Care to take the reins. Ey?

06:46.458 --> 06:47.462
Do it, man.

06:58.510 --> 06:59.534
Oops.

07:01.494 --> 07:03.529
Go west, young man.

07:03.530 --> 07:05.477
Well, south west.

07:05.478 --> 07:06.522
45 calibre.

07:08.490 --> 07:11.461
You see here where it's hexagonal?

07:11.462 --> 07:13.526
That slug definitely
came from a Whitworth.

07:13.527 --> 07:14.545
It's a rifle.

07:14.546 --> 07:19.530
Sharpshooter's favourite. The kind
of shooter that would keep his eye
in at a gun range.

07:19.531 --> 07:21.469
The rifle range, Wimbledon.

07:21.470 --> 07:22.493
Ready a hansom.

07:22.494 --> 07:24.488
Now, Reid, I know
you're no gunslinger,

07:24.489 --> 07:27.472
but most folks like to see
what they're shooting at.

07:27.473 --> 07:30.508
The light's fallen, sir. Club will
be closed before we cross London.

07:30.509 --> 07:33.452
Ah, first thing, then.
We've other business.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.472
Jackson, get to work.

07:34.473 --> 07:36.522
And fetch a mop, man.
You're not at home now.

07:39.474 --> 07:41.550
Sir, I... I wonder if I might have
a minute of your time

07:41.551 --> 07:43.477
to discuss a matter of...

07:43.478 --> 07:44.497
Ah, Inspector!

07:44.498 --> 07:46.518
I have brought the records
that you requested.

07:46.519 --> 07:48.453
Thank you, Mr Wheen.

07:48.454 --> 07:50.508
I'm aware you have pressing
matters at hand. Well, indeed.

07:50.509 --> 07:53.512
And order shall be restored
at Wheen & Harker Insurance.

07:53.513 --> 07:57.526
I only give thanks to God that there
was no money on the premises when
the villains came a calling.

07:57.527 --> 08:00.478
You may wish to
ration your gratitude.

08:02.494 --> 08:04.533
White's Row, clear as day...

08:04.534 --> 08:08.488
Inspector, surely you can't be
suggesting... Mr Wheen, these men
are not amateurs

08:08.489 --> 08:11.472
and not the kind to break into your
office to leave empty-handed.

08:11.473 --> 08:13.508
They didn't want money,
but your insurance records.

08:13.509 --> 08:17.454
Everything they needed to ambush
this carriage is laid out right here.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.478
No! That's, it would mean...

08:20.542 --> 08:24.476
Hapsburg Jewellers is but one
client of hundreds. Hundreds!

08:24.477 --> 08:27.542
And all have lodged their security
provisions, their fireplans,

08:27.543 --> 08:30.457
their inventories
with Wheen & Harker!

08:30.458 --> 08:33.477
Are you suggesting that any
and all are at threat of,

08:33.479 --> 08:35.496
of plotted villainy?!

08:35.498 --> 08:38.494
I mean, imagine if word spread?
I would be destitute!

08:38.495 --> 08:39.498
Inspector!

08:40.525 --> 08:44.534
It's the swag from the carriage,
sir. Well, it's only been delivered.

08:44.535 --> 08:46.473
Delivered? Where?

08:46.474 --> 08:48.468
To the jeweller who had it
nicked, sir.

08:48.469 --> 08:49.518
Left right on the doorstep.

08:49.519 --> 08:53.485
All accounted for, sir,
'cept one thing.

08:53.486 --> 08:55.529
One sapphire.

08:55.530 --> 08:58.505
One single blue sapphire.

08:58.506 --> 09:01.488
Why such keen travail to steal
what you don't want?

09:01.489 --> 09:03.534
All that for one small gem. Why?

09:03.535 --> 09:06.457
Is Wheen in on it, sir?

09:06.458 --> 09:08.536
I smell fear on him, not guilt.

09:08.537 --> 09:12.482
Man like that hasn't the stomach
for acts improper. The safe...

09:12.483 --> 09:16.469
Like you said, it's blast-proof.
A new design?

09:16.470 --> 09:20.469
Sir, might we, erm... have that word?

09:20.470 --> 09:21.533
What?

09:21.534 --> 09:23.526
Oh, yes, of course. Certainly.

09:29.462 --> 09:31.470
So, Bennet.

09:32.486 --> 09:34.462
Inspector, I, er...

09:36.510 --> 09:40.530
My service being of some years now
with the greatest of dedication,

09:40.531 --> 09:43.522
and being, I hope,
to your satisfaction...

09:45.482 --> 09:47.494
I wondered if you
might consider...

09:49.454 --> 09:50.522
That is, if you think it merited...

09:50.523 --> 09:52.474
Are you asking for a raise?

09:56.538 --> 09:58.532
Well, there's no question
it's merited.

09:58.533 --> 10:01.456
Whether it's possible is,
I fear, another matter.

10:01.457 --> 10:03.470
Resources, as you know, are limited.

10:04.546 --> 10:06.541
Bennet, may I ask,

10:06.542 --> 10:09.502
does this request come from you
or from Rose?

10:12.490 --> 10:15.532
Your interest in the girl
has not escaped me.

10:15.533 --> 10:18.526
I, er... I don't think
I take your meaning.

10:18.527 --> 10:20.509
Oh, Bennet...

10:20.510 --> 10:22.516
A bobtail like that
will look you deep in the eye

10:22.517 --> 10:24.502
only so long as she's deep
in your pocket.

10:24.503 --> 10:26.510
No! She's not!

10:27.534 --> 10:30.538
You don't know her. All my years of
policing, I've known her kind plenty,

10:30.539 --> 10:35.465
as have you. I'm, I'm simply saying,

10:35.466 --> 10:36.542
beware the kitten's claws.

10:42.498 --> 10:45.453
My request was, er...

10:45.454 --> 10:47.453
I misspoke.

10:47.454 --> 10:48.538
It was a foolish fancy. Nothing...

10:48.539 --> 10:50.485
Bennet...

10:50.486 --> 10:51.526
Good evening, sir.

10:56.546 --> 10:58.466
Bennet?

11:01.514 --> 11:04.513
Sergeant! Listen, Sergeant...

11:04.514 --> 11:06.474
Stand straight, Sergeant!

11:09.486 --> 11:10.518
At ease, man.

11:12.542 --> 11:14.506
Colonel!

11:16.494 --> 11:19.481
Inspector Reid,
Colonel Madoc Faulkner.

11:19.482 --> 11:21.469
A great pleasure, Inspector.

11:21.470 --> 11:22.548
What brings you to London, sir?

11:22.549 --> 11:25.550
The briefest of business en route
to more tranquil climes,

11:25.551 --> 11:27.505
as befits a retiree.

11:27.506 --> 11:28.525
Oh?

11:28.526 --> 11:32.464
Comes a time for every soldier
to sheathe his sword, Sergeant.

11:32.465 --> 11:34.488
I hoped you might join me
for dinner,

11:34.489 --> 11:36.534
toast the onset of my twilight.

11:36.535 --> 11:38.489
Well, of course.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.549
And you too, Inspector Reid.

11:40.550 --> 11:43.506
I shouldn't want to intrude
on old friends. Sir, I insist.

11:45.542 --> 11:48.529
Few of my old friends remain,
Inspector.

11:48.530 --> 11:51.510
Allow me the pleasure of making new.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.520
Gordon was slain by the incompetence
of Gladstone

11:57.521 --> 11:59.544
and his horde of cowering acolytes.

11:59.545 --> 12:02.488
And I have little clemency
for men behind desks

12:02.489 --> 12:04.518
in high places with low honour.

12:04.519 --> 12:07.482
Are you admiring my heart, sir?

12:08.550 --> 12:11.489
I've seen its like
in the British Museum.

12:11.490 --> 12:15.533
It was dug from a tomb in Dashur
with my own hands.

12:15.534 --> 12:18.500
The Egyptians placed
heart-scarabs with the dead,

12:18.501 --> 12:20.534
so their own heart
would not betray them.

12:23.466 --> 12:27.457
Do you remember the ceremony
of judgment, Sergeant?

12:27.458 --> 12:28.698
Oh, I'm not certain if I, er...

12:32.498 --> 12:35.473
Let me see, if memory serves,

12:35.474 --> 12:38.506
they believed the gods placed the
heart in the scales against
a feather.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.513
The Feather of Justice.

12:40.514 --> 12:43.500
Now, if the heart spoke of no sin,
the scales balanced,

12:43.501 --> 12:45.520
and the soul could join
the afterlife.

12:45.521 --> 12:50.490
Some might have it that keeping
silent of sin does not commeasure
being free from them.

12:50.491 --> 12:53.502
The Egyptians were
a practical people.

12:55.454 --> 12:57.486
Is there so much you hope to silence?

12:59.458 --> 13:02.526
I would not have thought
any man who'd seen war could ask
such a question.

13:04.530 --> 13:07.457
The Inspector did not serve,
Colonel.

13:07.458 --> 13:08.533
Oh!

13:08.534 --> 13:10.534
And you take a position of command?

13:12.502 --> 13:14.501
Do you think me unqualified?

13:14.502 --> 13:17.508
I should not presume to comment
on your present post, sir.

13:17.509 --> 13:19.516
My wars were against enemies
of the Empire,

13:19.517 --> 13:21.544
not the poor and desperate
of its capital.

13:21.545 --> 13:23.538
Is that how you imagine our role?

13:23.539 --> 13:26.513
I lack imagination, Inspector.

13:26.514 --> 13:31.469
What I know is good men who
served our Queen with their all

13:31.470 --> 13:33.520
now languish as reward
at Her Majesty's Pleasure.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.550
Did they commit a crime?

13:34.551 --> 13:37.453
They returned from noble service

13:37.454 --> 13:40.522
to a homeland which offered
neither gratitude nor succour.

13:40.523 --> 13:43.453
The best of us made hungry
and penniless

13:43.454 --> 13:46.469
will react, in extremis,
with extremity.

13:46.470 --> 13:47.550
I'm afraid that
does not absolve them.

13:47.551 --> 13:52.481
No. All men stand equal
before the law, do they not?

13:52.482 --> 13:54.477
The hero and the whoremonger.

13:54.478 --> 13:55.480
That is the law.

13:55.481 --> 13:56.486
It is your law.

13:59.470 --> 14:00.502
Is it yours?

14:03.534 --> 14:05.457
Colonel, I...

14:05.458 --> 14:09.476
Well, be assured you have the finest
man in your Sergeant, sir.

14:09.477 --> 14:10.508
Yes, I'm aware of it.

14:10.509 --> 14:12.516
I was forced to give officers'
commissions

14:12.517 --> 14:16.528
to spoiled Sandhurst brats who
weren't fit to shine his boots.

14:16.529 --> 14:19.530
With an army of Drakes,
I could've saved Khartoum.

14:21.534 --> 14:24.526
I never knew a man
hungrier for Dervish blood.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.457
Police work pleases you?

14:31.458 --> 14:32.518
Walking the beat?

14:32.519 --> 14:35.473
The humble bobby's lot?

14:35.474 --> 14:37.522
I don't think I take your meaning,
Colonel.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.478
Excuse me.

14:44.454 --> 14:47.489
Be not afraid.
Have you lodging tonight?

14:47.490 --> 14:48.538
Coin for a meal?

14:55.470 --> 14:57.468
Thank you, sir.
Let us hope they find shelter

14:57.469 --> 15:00.518
before your Reid shackles them
for vagrancy.

15:00.519 --> 15:03.517
Thus our glorious
Britannia, Sergeant.

15:03.518 --> 15:05.480
She takes a man and hollows him.

15:05.481 --> 15:08.514
Spits him back with the marrow
still dripping from her maw.

15:08.515 --> 15:10.506
Not every man, Colonel.

15:12.486 --> 15:15.522
I would not have thought to hear
you speak as one unscathed.

15:20.474 --> 15:21.534
Hrrmmh...

15:23.454 --> 15:24.470
Hrrmmh...

15:25.530 --> 15:26.550
Yeah.

15:33.514 --> 15:37.481
Sweet ma'am, hot-damn!

15:37.482 --> 15:38.546
Wow!

15:44.518 --> 15:47.545
You do make a rumpus,
Captain Jackson.

15:47.546 --> 15:51.520
Well, a man has got to be
vocal in his pleasures, darlin'.

15:51.521 --> 15:54.550
Hell, I'll bet Drake grunts away
like a rutting rhinoceros.

15:56.474 --> 15:58.509
I wouldn't know.

15:58.510 --> 16:01.489
And leave Bennet alone.
He's all right.

16:01.490 --> 16:03.497
He's just so goddamn serious.

16:03.498 --> 16:05.536
Why don't you take me
to the theatre?

16:05.537 --> 16:08.544
You think I need a bunch of fake
people selling me fake feelings?

16:08.545 --> 16:10.538
I live in a goddamn whorehouse.

16:10.539 --> 16:14.549
Since you mention it,
no more free ones, house rules.

16:14.550 --> 16:17.489
Hmmm, but I have a tab
with the house.

16:17.490 --> 16:19.517
I do! Look at me.

16:19.518 --> 16:22.522
Is this not the most honest
face you've ever sat on?

16:25.510 --> 16:27.546
Sergeant Drake, I remember,
had but one mistress.

16:27.547 --> 16:29.550
Or are you now cured?

16:33.514 --> 16:35.454
What's her name?

16:36.530 --> 16:37.546
Rose.

16:38.550 --> 16:40.482
Will you marry her?

16:42.470 --> 16:43.502
I'm not sure she'd go.

16:46.454 --> 16:48.485
My means are modest, Colonel.

16:48.486 --> 16:49.502
And what of hers?

16:50.526 --> 16:52.477
She hopes to be an actress.

16:52.478 --> 16:53.533
Hopes to be?

16:53.534 --> 16:55.486
What is she at present?

16:59.486 --> 17:02.473
In extremis, extremity.

17:02.474 --> 17:06.470
Those who need it most in this cruel
city find mercy least.

17:07.550 --> 17:11.461
If you love her, make her yours.

17:11.462 --> 17:13.497
There's no riddle to it.

17:13.498 --> 17:14.538
You tell Mr Reid that.

17:14.539 --> 17:17.530
He and I, it seems,
disagree on much.

17:23.486 --> 17:27.510
I think a reunion of comrades merits
something stronger, don't you?

17:27.511 --> 17:28.518
Oh...

17:30.470 --> 17:33.534
Mr Reid gave me some brandy
last Christmas, I've been saving it.

17:39.506 --> 17:44.490
I've tried to keep up my reading,
sir. Especially Egypt...

17:48.534 --> 17:50.550
Though it's a bugger
to find the time

17:50.551 --> 17:52.526
with all my police work...

18:13.538 --> 18:15.529
It's military.

18:15.530 --> 18:17.486
Picric acid.

18:18.502 --> 18:23.453
Army's branding it
"lyddite" for new munitions.

18:23.454 --> 18:25.542
Makes gunpowder
look like peppercorns.

18:25.543 --> 18:27.549
Smoke-bombs, lyddite.

18:27.550 --> 18:30.516
This hardware is not found
on the shelves of a musket shop.

18:30.517 --> 18:32.530
Somebody must be supplying it.
Find out who.

18:32.531 --> 18:35.521
Me?
Yes, Jackson, you!

18:35.522 --> 18:38.488
I'd stake my wage that amongst
the reprobates and low lives

18:38.489 --> 18:39.532
that comprise your intimates

18:39.533 --> 18:43.530
somebody must know of a gun seller
recently giddy with profit.

18:43.531 --> 18:45.510
Is that an actual stake?

18:50.506 --> 18:53.472
I therefore have urgent questions
concerning your products

18:53.473 --> 18:55.524
and require conference
at the earliest.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.530
Get it to the Chatwood Safe Company.

18:57.531 --> 18:59.549
Right away, sir.

18:59.550 --> 19:01.529
Anything more, Inspector?

19:01.530 --> 19:04.482
Yes. Where's Sergeant Drake?

19:21.478 --> 19:23.496
How did you find me, Sergeant?

19:23.497 --> 19:24.540
I'm a policeman.

19:24.541 --> 19:27.546
Have you informed your Inspector
of my involvement?

19:31.454 --> 19:33.512
Let it end now
and you have my silence.

19:33.513 --> 19:35.546
But I beg of you - leave London.

19:35.547 --> 19:39.521
But ahead lies an operation
of true magnificence...

19:39.522 --> 19:42.454
for which I need you, Sergeant.

19:43.534 --> 19:45.470
I'm a policeman!

19:47.506 --> 19:50.494
Then let us speak of justice,
copper.

19:52.530 --> 19:55.506
Would you have walked past
those men last night, hmm?

19:55.507 --> 19:57.505
Hurried on your way?

19:57.506 --> 19:59.488
They are your brothers, Sergeant!

19:59.489 --> 20:02.524
And the Crown you served
and serve still will not think twice

20:02.525 --> 20:04.502
to leave you heaped with them.

20:04.503 --> 20:08.513
But we will show this rotted
kingdom true justice.

20:08.514 --> 20:10.500
Colonel, please, do not ask me...

20:10.501 --> 20:11.512
Remember who you are?

20:11.513 --> 20:13.522
Or do you prefer to be
at Reid's beck and call,

20:13.523 --> 20:15.465
tethered and lowly as a dog?

20:15.466 --> 20:18.510
I am not...
You are the warrior I forged of you.

20:18.511 --> 20:22.493
Not the slavish henchman
of a crippled coward.

20:22.494 --> 20:25.469
But how it must suit him
to hold you thus.

20:25.470 --> 20:28.498
Small wonder he'd seek
to keep you from your Rose.

20:31.454 --> 20:34.474
Don't you deserve to sleep
at peace in her arm?

20:35.510 --> 20:39.522
To writhe no more in the serpent
strangle of your nightmares?

20:43.470 --> 20:45.502
Every soldier betrayed
deserves their due.

20:45.503 --> 20:47.549
And we shall see they get it.

20:47.550 --> 20:50.525
We shall reclaim from this kingdom

20:50.526 --> 20:52.530
riches beyond measure...

20:54.458 --> 20:58.498
Reward enough for each man thrown
by his bitch queen to the wolves.

20:59.534 --> 21:02.469
And then, a life far from here.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.550
Your Rose's pretty hand
held in yours for all time.

21:09.538 --> 21:13.494
Stone of perception
to the Egyptians.

21:15.470 --> 21:19.453
Cleopatra herself had sapphires
in her eye-shadow

21:19.454 --> 21:21.482
that she might see the more wisely.

21:24.502 --> 21:26.490
You know where to find me.

21:28.506 --> 21:30.474
My eggs are getting cold.

21:44.462 --> 21:47.453
An elegant weapon indeed, Inspector.

21:47.454 --> 21:49.542
Some of our finest marksmen
do still favour the Whitworth.

21:49.543 --> 21:51.477
Who?

21:51.478 --> 21:53.472
Our membership is confidential, sir.

21:53.473 --> 21:57.540
I fear it behoves my custodial duty
to ask what this enquiry portends.

21:57.541 --> 22:00.538
We pulled a Whitworth bullet
from the brains of a horse

22:00.539 --> 22:04.509
whose carriage had been burglarised
by armed men.

22:04.510 --> 22:07.534
Now, is your custodial duty
sufficiently fulfilled

22:07.535 --> 22:09.461
to oblige me in mine?

22:09.462 --> 22:11.536
Far be it from me to interfere
with your police work,

22:11.537 --> 22:14.498
but may I suggest you
commence your enquiries

22:14.499 --> 22:16.474
with a Mr George Doggett?

22:18.522 --> 22:20.476
Says he won the Queen's Prize.

22:20.477 --> 22:22.528
Our highest award, indeed he did.

22:22.529 --> 22:25.518
Before events led to him perforce
being expelled from the club.

22:25.519 --> 22:26.537
Events?

22:26.538 --> 22:29.501
Stealing. From other members.

22:29.502 --> 22:33.457
That and his taste for live targets.

22:33.458 --> 22:38.521
Birds, squirrels, cats, dogs.

22:38.522 --> 22:41.518
The local pet-owners, alas,
took exception.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.486
Bennet!

23:04.470 --> 23:06.526
Your attentions seem elsewhere.

23:06.527 --> 23:08.481
I'm quite all right, sir.

23:08.482 --> 23:09.528
Look, about our talk yesterday.

23:09.529 --> 23:12.542
It was the onset of a head cold.
Nothing more.

23:33.486 --> 23:34.506
Mr Doggett?

23:38.514 --> 23:39.542
Take it.

23:42.534 --> 23:44.474
If you please.

23:45.506 --> 23:46.542
Thank you.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.524
Copied directly from the policy.

24:21.525 --> 24:23.530
Mr Wheen is going
to have the vapours.

24:47.510 --> 24:48.542
I know you, Sergeant.

24:50.510 --> 24:52.477
You're the one, ey?

24:52.478 --> 24:53.542
Scourge of the goddess.

24:55.478 --> 24:56.502
S'nothin' personal.

25:08.514 --> 25:09.526
You let him go?

25:14.482 --> 25:16.541
Ah, no matter.

25:16.542 --> 25:18.454
Look.

25:19.498 --> 25:20.521
The next job?

25:20.522 --> 25:23.461
Copied directly from
Wheen's files also.

25:23.462 --> 25:24.534
Take weeks to match that.

25:24.535 --> 25:26.473
Then, we narrow the field.

25:26.474 --> 25:28.546
Time to speak to
Mr Chatwood about his safes.

25:36.514 --> 25:38.489
But our safes are tested!

25:38.490 --> 25:40.541
Repeatedly! Exhaustively!

25:40.542 --> 25:43.512
I sought out the most nefarious
screwsmen in the city,

25:43.513 --> 25:45.520
all were defeated by our new locks!

25:45.521 --> 25:48.480
Mr Chatwood,
whomever we contend with here,

25:48.481 --> 25:50.464
they are no ordinary cracksmen.

25:50.465 --> 25:54.516
I have never known of thieves to
take such a haul only to return it.

25:54.517 --> 25:57.542
I need to know every
owner of a Chatwood safe,

25:57.543 --> 26:01.489
every purchaser of your new model
and I need to know...

26:01.490 --> 26:03.482
now!

26:04.494 --> 26:05.512
Owners of a Chatwood.

26:05.513 --> 26:06.548
On the double to Wheen & Harker,

26:06.549 --> 26:08.528
cross refer with their policy
holders,

26:08.529 --> 26:11.468
find out to which of them
this groundplan might pertain.

26:11.469 --> 26:13.488
If Mr Wheen is anything less
than a perfect host,

26:13.489 --> 26:15.508
tell him I've a cell
he's welcome to fill.

26:15.509 --> 26:18.526
Inspector Reid,
this could take me all night, sir!

26:20.502 --> 26:23.468
One day, Constable, there will be
gleaming machines

26:23.469 --> 26:25.512
that will perhaps make light work
of such a process.

26:25.513 --> 26:29.468
But, for now, you'll find, in the
custody of Sergeant Artherton,

26:29.469 --> 26:30.548
some exceptional Turkish coffee,

26:30.549 --> 26:33.510
with which I suggest you make
keen acquaintance.

26:51.486 --> 26:52.490
Bennet!

26:54.510 --> 26:55.545
Miss Rose.

26:55.546 --> 26:58.477
What a lovely surprise!

26:58.478 --> 27:00.525
Have you booked me?

27:00.526 --> 27:02.513
No!

27:02.514 --> 27:03.534
I came to...

27:05.514 --> 27:06.518
to ask you...

27:09.506 --> 27:10.545
Yes?

27:10.546 --> 27:15.493
That is, after what you were
saying, if...

27:15.494 --> 27:18.481
Well, if, say, I were a man of means

27:18.482 --> 27:22.509
and if I could support you,
in your acting?

27:22.510 --> 27:26.542
Like a patron? Yeah, yeah,
like the very thing, what you...

27:26.543 --> 27:30.518
Oh, Bennet, what a pretty thought!

27:31.518 --> 27:33.482
May I offer you some tea?

27:35.462 --> 27:38.522
I should love most of all
to see New York and I...

27:38.523 --> 27:39.526
Rose.

27:40.526 --> 27:42.470
Don't keep them waiting.

27:43.550 --> 27:46.458
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.

27:52.514 --> 27:56.498
If you want her time, you will have
to pay for it like everyone else.

27:58.462 --> 28:00.486
Will that be all, Sergeant?

28:12.482 --> 28:14.473
Oy!

28:14.474 --> 28:16.482
Will that be all, Mr Drake?!

28:18.530 --> 28:22.470
This is a place of business,
not a prize-ring.

28:28.546 --> 28:31.542
Godammit. I know you're cheating.

28:40.542 --> 28:42.470
Sergeant!

28:45.482 --> 28:46.525
Sergeant.

28:46.526 --> 28:48.518
Count me out, I'll be back.

28:55.550 --> 28:58.526
Care to join our merry
game of chance, Sergeant?

28:59.550 --> 29:01.530
Fill these till the cup be hid.

29:06.506 --> 29:07.529
Look, Drake.

29:07.530 --> 29:11.550
I know we've had our differences,
but I've been thinking, well,

29:11.551 --> 29:14.538
what do you say
we bury the hatchet, huh?

29:16.466 --> 29:17.504
Cos from where I'm standing,

29:17.505 --> 29:20.476
me and you seem like two fellas
with plenty in common.

29:20.477 --> 29:21.530
We have nothing in common.

29:23.514 --> 29:27.490
Men who've walked through the fire
never shed the heat, Sergeant.

29:29.454 --> 29:32.478
They see on each other the burns
that other people don't.

29:34.466 --> 29:39.489
Nah, me and you,
we got plenty in common.

29:39.490 --> 29:43.477
The worst and best in life - war...

29:43.478 --> 29:44.522
and women.

29:47.466 --> 29:48.478
Yeah.

29:50.498 --> 29:53.466
I heard you, er... stepped out
with Rose.

29:55.478 --> 29:57.473
The theatre, no less, huh!

29:57.474 --> 29:58.516
Leave me be now, Jackson.

29:58.517 --> 30:00.488
You just watch your purse-strings.

30:00.489 --> 30:02.512
It's only gratis till you're hooked.

30:02.513 --> 30:05.480
I said. Leave me be.
Also a word to the wise,

30:05.481 --> 30:07.532
you might like to keep your strength
about you with that one

30:07.533 --> 30:11.526
cos her sweet little mouth could
suck a melon through a rye stalk.

30:11.527 --> 30:13.533
Come on, Drake.

30:13.534 --> 30:15.457
We're friends!

30:15.458 --> 30:17.502
There's no shame in supping
a buttered bun, huh?

31:45.514 --> 31:47.474
He wants to run away with me.

31:48.494 --> 31:52.550
"The triple pillar of the world
transformed into a strumpet's fool."

31:56.462 --> 31:57.490
Be kind.

31:58.506 --> 31:59.521
Accident.

31:59.522 --> 32:02.502
I'm not talking about me,
dumb tail. To Drake.

32:04.462 --> 32:05.583
He has a sweet heart, but...

32:07.466 --> 32:09.514
Captain Jackson, I'm hardly going
to give myself

32:09.515 --> 32:11.477
to some Whitechapel plodder.

32:11.478 --> 32:12.550
That's my meaning exactly.

32:12.551 --> 32:15.454
When you break his heart, be kind.

32:17.522 --> 32:18.530
What do you care?

32:20.490 --> 32:23.534
I've just been where he's been
before, that's all.

32:24.550 --> 32:26.454
Besides...

32:30.462 --> 32:32.478
it's going to end badly.

32:34.482 --> 32:35.510
Why do you say that?

32:35.511 --> 32:37.514
Jesus Christ. What doesn't?

32:47.462 --> 32:50.488
Hobbs? Still at Wheen & Harker.
He telegraphed.

32:50.489 --> 32:52.456
Estimates a return mid-morning,

32:52.457 --> 32:56.536
provided consumption of my coffee
does not provoke a further eruptive
crisis of the lad's young gut pipes.

32:56.537 --> 32:59.498
Send another constable.
Blake, Riggs, anyone, tell them...

33:02.478 --> 33:04.501
Tip from a fence,

33:04.502 --> 33:06.489
narks for a tanner.

33:06.490 --> 33:08.481
He was trying to sell this.

33:08.482 --> 33:10.540
Wanted something for me trouble.

33:10.541 --> 33:13.542
More fool them what won't pocket
what they pilfer. Who?

33:13.543 --> 33:15.485
Dream on, copper.

33:15.486 --> 33:18.533
My throat's good as sliced
if I turn nose.

33:18.534 --> 33:21.498
I'll see much worse awaits you
if you do not.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.533
You've no idea what awaits.

33:23.534 --> 33:26.466
Had a rummage in me old satchel,
didn't ya?

33:26.467 --> 33:28.469
Found something tasty.

33:28.470 --> 33:30.514
Bet you'd give a nut
to know where's next.

33:33.518 --> 33:34.550
Get stuffed.

33:38.458 --> 33:40.526
I'm sorry, what I meant
to say was...

33:40.527 --> 33:43.470
suck a fat bag of brown chutney!

33:47.550 --> 33:49.525
Decorated marksman.

33:49.526 --> 33:53.497
To hear some tell it,
the finest shot in all the Rifles.

33:53.498 --> 33:55.497
And look at you...

33:55.498 --> 33:58.453
chained like a dog and for what?

33:58.454 --> 33:59.530
We've been kicked
like dogs every day

33:59.531 --> 34:03.469
since we stopped fighting
for gutless bastards like you.

34:03.470 --> 34:06.473
Sleeping in shit
and chewing on scraps.

34:06.474 --> 34:07.546
Think we didn't want jobs?

34:07.547 --> 34:10.501
Normal lives? Plenty manage.

34:10.502 --> 34:12.485
What do you know, pig?

34:18.482 --> 34:19.485
Sergeant.

34:29.469 --> 34:30.474
Again.

34:32.525 --> 34:34.505
Wait.

34:34.505 --> 34:37.453
What say you make it worth my while?

34:37.454 --> 34:38.522
How's about a little bargain?

34:38.523 --> 34:40.478
I do not bargain.

34:49.502 --> 34:54.462
You think you scare me, with your
little cell and your snarling grunt?

34:56.514 --> 34:58.509
What I've seen,

34:58.510 --> 35:00.521
you'd scream yourself deaf,

35:00.522 --> 35:02.494
you'd piss your civvie pants.

35:04.498 --> 35:06.524
You want to stop 'em,
you'll bargain.

35:06.525 --> 35:09.550
And you'll do it quick smart,
or by noon, they'll be gone.

35:14.494 --> 35:15.506
What do you want?

35:17.510 --> 35:20.530
Lose the gorilla.
I don't care for his stink.

35:36.474 --> 35:38.538
Hawkins. He's the leader
and the schemer.

35:38.539 --> 35:41.465
Great, big beautiful safes,

35:41.466 --> 35:43.469
stuffed stupid with lucre.

35:43.470 --> 35:45.458
Going to blow them all
and take the lot.

35:45.459 --> 35:46.462
Where?

35:47.490 --> 35:49.518
Your word.
I don't go down with them.

35:49.519 --> 35:51.470
Tell me. Your word.

35:53.514 --> 35:54.518
You have it.

35:56.462 --> 35:59.482
Metropolitan Precious Metals
Company. Shadwell.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.544
You stay in this cell
until I have Hawkins.

36:06.545 --> 36:10.518
If you're gulling me, I'll tie
the noose around your neck myself.

36:17.482 --> 36:19.548
All of them. I need every man.
Should we not wait for Hobbs...?

36:19.549 --> 36:23.494
Metropolitan Metals checks both
lists. What would you have me do?

36:23.495 --> 36:24.549
Sir.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.502
And dammit, where is Drake?!

36:38.522 --> 36:40.510
Welcome home, Sergeant Drake.

36:45.506 --> 36:47.504
It's an honour to soldier
at your side again.

36:47.505 --> 36:48.518
And yours, Corporal.

36:48.519 --> 36:51.497
But this war's worth the fighting.

36:51.498 --> 36:54.488
Saved me from the bottle
and the pipe, he did.

36:54.489 --> 36:56.502
And what the Colonel's
planned here...

36:58.510 --> 37:00.454
it's an eye for an eye.

37:19.490 --> 37:21.493
Good morning, sir.

37:21.494 --> 37:24.469
H-Division, for Inspector Reid.

37:24.470 --> 37:26.492
Listen, there's been word
of a cunning robbery,

37:26.493 --> 37:28.466
I need to speak to your superior.

37:28.467 --> 37:29.526
Yes, sir.

38:04.522 --> 38:06.504
Never had you for a Peeping Tom.

38:06.505 --> 38:09.494
Out of sight, man. Did the Pinkertons
teach you nothing?

38:31.514 --> 38:34.509
So I've been turning
stones like you asked.

38:34.510 --> 38:37.498
Seems these fellas
haven't gone un-noticed.

38:37.499 --> 38:40.457
The thieves are soldiers,
they used to be.

38:40.458 --> 38:43.494
The leader's a Colonel with a grudge
the size of the Sahara.

38:44.514 --> 38:45.533
Hawkins?

38:45.534 --> 38:47.530
Hmm. Close. Faulkner.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.462
Faulkner? Uh-huh.

38:56.470 --> 38:57.494
Get me a hansom!

39:13.490 --> 39:14.494
Thanks very much.

39:18.494 --> 39:20.489
Easy now, all right.

39:20.490 --> 39:21.498
There you go.

39:49.474 --> 39:50.482
Oy!

39:55.494 --> 39:56.502
Help!

40:01.522 --> 40:03.461
Where is Faulkner?

40:03.462 --> 40:04.524
You're too late, arse crack.

40:04.525 --> 40:06.480
We'll all of us be paid in full

40:06.481 --> 40:08.474
before you've found the end
of Leman Street.

40:08.475 --> 40:09.494
Inspector!

40:11.466 --> 40:12.530
Only three possibles, sir.

40:17.462 --> 40:18.541
The Mint.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.542
They're going for the bloody Mint.

40:27.506 --> 40:28.533
Good morning.

40:28.534 --> 40:31.526
Good morning, gentlemen,
we have a delivery for you.

40:41.458 --> 40:42.482
What you doing?

40:44.470 --> 40:46.462
I thought you said
no man would be hurt.

40:46.463 --> 40:49.461
I said no man need die. Nor will he.

40:49.462 --> 40:52.490
A scratch is all.
Police work's turned you soft.

41:04.494 --> 41:07.453
Everybody pay attention,
nobody gets hurt.

41:07.454 --> 41:08.510
Over the other side!

41:08.511 --> 41:10.545
Come on! On your bellies!

41:10.546 --> 41:14.477
Get down! Down!

41:14.478 --> 41:16.490
Your attention, please!

41:17.514 --> 41:21.525
We are here for Her Wretched
Majesty's gold.

41:21.526 --> 41:24.493
Mistake us not for common thieves.

41:24.494 --> 41:27.481
We seek not to harm a single man.

41:27.482 --> 41:30.545
Be still and be silent
and return unscathed

41:30.546 --> 41:32.534
to your homes and your families.

42:19.458 --> 42:20.530
Have at it.

42:23.478 --> 42:24.522
You too, Sergeant.

42:26.534 --> 42:28.506
To the spoils.

42:47.470 --> 42:48.493
Lynch!

42:48.494 --> 42:49.530
Lynch!

42:52.482 --> 42:53.518
Jesus Christ!

42:56.462 --> 42:57.474
No!

43:00.486 --> 43:01.494
Hold your fire.

43:08.526 --> 43:11.477
Well, Sergeant?

43:11.478 --> 43:14.477
Call it off now.
A last chance for you.

43:14.478 --> 43:18.530
I take him in. The rest of you
leave the gold, disappear.

43:19.538 --> 43:21.465
Please, Colonel.

43:21.466 --> 43:23.462
Think twice, Harris.

43:25.482 --> 43:28.505
You have no idea of your quarry.

43:28.506 --> 43:31.470
Not a man amongst you
knows the measure of him.

43:32.478 --> 43:35.514
At El Teb, Sergeant Drake
was cut off from his regiment.

43:35.515 --> 43:38.465
Trapped and circled by Dervishes.

43:38.466 --> 43:41.544
But when the sun fell blood-red
on the desert that night,

43:41.545 --> 43:44.506
every single one of them
was slain by his hand.

43:45.542 --> 43:47.545
Was it not so, Sergeant?

43:47.546 --> 43:51.514
How I found you
screaming in the dunes...

43:53.550 --> 43:57.550
the limbs of men strewn in
offering to your savage goddess?

43:59.538 --> 44:03.494
But today,
your goddess finds you wanting.

44:15.454 --> 44:16.482
Come here.

44:18.482 --> 44:19.545
Lynch.

44:19.546 --> 44:21.462
Bring him.

44:24.458 --> 44:27.506
If you care not for their spoils,
you shall join me in mine.

44:29.522 --> 44:31.474
You're stealing medals?

44:32.490 --> 44:35.501
I said I've no interest
in tawdry baubles.

44:35.502 --> 44:37.529
And what are these?

44:37.530 --> 44:40.454
The tawdriest bauble of them all.

44:48.534 --> 44:51.490
They shall know what
I think of their medals.

44:57.550 --> 44:59.466
Give me the lyddite.

45:02.518 --> 45:07.526
They shall know my justice
is a hurricane of fire.

45:18.518 --> 45:19.530
No!

45:23.502 --> 45:26.490
You shall not come
between the falcon and his prey.

45:28.550 --> 45:31.469
Of all men on Earth,

45:31.470 --> 45:33.542
you were the last
I thought could betray me.

45:33.543 --> 45:34.546
Colonel!

45:35.546 --> 45:36.550
Police.

45:40.454 --> 45:41.501
No.

45:41.502 --> 45:42.526
No.

45:43.534 --> 45:45.470
Outside.

46:03.462 --> 46:04.466
Move.

46:12.490 --> 46:14.490
Faulkner, surrender yourself!

46:17.542 --> 46:21.501
Get thee back!
May thy bones be broken!

46:21.502 --> 46:24.522
Let poison fall
and lie dead upon the ground

46:24.523 --> 46:29.490
for I have thrown open
the doors of the firmament!

46:48.490 --> 46:49.525
Reid.

46:49.526 --> 46:52.510
Attempt to ingress,
and Sergeant Drake will be shot

46:52.511 --> 46:54.461
and thrown from this window.

46:54.462 --> 46:55.546
Clear your police.

46:55.547 --> 46:58.509
Provide safe passage for my men,

46:58.510 --> 47:02.505
onto a ship and away
from this befouled land.

47:02.506 --> 47:06.517
Then and only then
will Drake see release.

47:06.518 --> 47:09.465
You know I can provide
no such thing.

47:09.466 --> 47:10.538
You can. And you shall.

47:10.539 --> 47:12.486
Or Drake dies.

47:17.526 --> 47:20.465
Reid. What?

47:20.466 --> 47:21.626
You still got that Whitworth?

47:36.474 --> 47:38.461
Faulkner!

47:38.462 --> 47:39.486
I accede.

47:52.526 --> 47:54.489
My men are cleared.

47:54.490 --> 47:56.470
You'll have safe passage.

47:58.518 --> 48:00.470
The copper's made good.

48:53.510 --> 48:55.526
Welcome home, Sergeant Drake.

48:57.458 --> 49:00.496
They told me
you sought out the black canyon,

49:00.497 --> 49:03.474
went under knife
and needle to slay your dreams.

49:04.486 --> 49:07.462
But all of your pain could not
sate her, could it?

49:10.474 --> 49:12.466
Your Lady of Flame owns you still.

49:13.538 --> 49:16.462
The Holy Man helped me.

49:17.542 --> 49:19.486
The goddess healed me.

49:20.490 --> 49:22.501
I am what I was no longer.

49:22.502 --> 49:23.518
Tell them that.

49:28.502 --> 49:29.534
Lay down your gun.

49:29.535 --> 49:31.478
Men like us, Sergeant...

49:32.526 --> 49:34.477
we carry her here.

49:34.478 --> 49:37.506
Lay down your gun.
I'm arresting you.

49:42.506 --> 49:45.482
You'll be cut down
the instant you step outside.

49:46.506 --> 49:47.518
It's finished.

49:49.502 --> 49:51.517
I had no choice.

49:51.518 --> 49:54.470
You understand that, don't you,
Sergeant?

49:57.530 --> 49:59.462
I want you to do it.

50:03.462 --> 50:04.466
No.

50:05.486 --> 50:06.490
Do it.

50:08.514 --> 50:09.546
I cannot, Colonel.

50:11.466 --> 50:12.534
An order, Sergeant!

50:16.466 --> 50:18.486
I'm not your Sergeant any more.

50:35.470 --> 50:38.456
His deeds are righteous
in the great balance

50:38.457 --> 50:40.490
and no sin has been found on him.

50:42.458 --> 50:45.474
For his heart is yet lighter
than Truth's feather.

50:46.530 --> 50:48.465
Inspector Reid,

50:48.466 --> 50:49.498
I know you are here.

50:56.486 --> 50:58.506
You need medical attention.
Get Jackson.

50:58.507 --> 51:00.509
Wait, Inspector.

51:00.510 --> 51:04.546
You should be aware that Sergeant
Drake was forced against his will
at gunpoint,

51:04.547 --> 51:07.474
to become an accessory
to these crimes.

51:08.502 --> 51:13.457
He is for his own part as fine
a policeman as he was a soldier

51:13.458 --> 51:15.530
and innocent of all wrongdoing.

51:15.531 --> 51:17.466
And, Inspector...

51:19.466 --> 51:22.489
when you return
to your home this eve,

51:22.490 --> 51:25.452
give thanks to your God
you will never set eyes

51:25.453 --> 51:26.774
upon the things I have witnessed.

51:28.546 --> 51:32.486
The bravest of men
butchered like pigs.

51:33.498 --> 51:37.518
Sons and brothers in their hundreds
left for carrion.

51:40.486 --> 51:44.526
Dirt-beetles crawling at feast
in their torn hollow.

51:48.474 --> 51:50.482
And all for Queen and Country.

51:58.550 --> 52:01.458
They were fools, the Egyptians.

52:03.454 --> 52:06.530
What god could hope to reckon
the weight of one man's heart?

52:10.494 --> 52:11.510
No!

52:38.458 --> 52:41.534
Inspector, what the Colonel
said about my, er...

52:43.474 --> 52:45.478
my wrongdoing.
I need to tell you...

52:45.479 --> 52:46.526
Sergeant.

52:47.530 --> 52:51.478
I have no reason to doubt
the candour of the man's confession.

52:55.550 --> 52:57.454
Wait.

53:21.510 --> 53:23.482
I intend no trouble.

53:36.462 --> 53:37.481
Hello, Bennet.

53:37.482 --> 53:39.501
Miss Rose.

53:39.502 --> 53:41.477
I...

53:41.478 --> 53:43.465
Good day.

53:43.466 --> 53:44.534
Good day to you.

53:48.470 --> 53:50.522
There's something
I should like to say, if I may.

53:50.523 --> 53:52.470
Of course!

53:57.454 --> 54:00.464
There's a story told by
the Egyptians of a goddess.

54:00.465 --> 54:02.514
A terrible goddess, of war and pain.

54:03.530 --> 54:06.457
They said her breath
was screaming fire,

54:06.458 --> 54:08.508
what carved out the deserts
and howled in the winds.

54:08.509 --> 54:11.530
They said death and bloodshed
was balm for her heart.

54:11.531 --> 54:15.501
But in the story,
her heart's becalmed.

54:15.502 --> 54:17.465
Her rage is quelled.

54:17.466 --> 54:20.502
And the goddess of war transforms
into the goddess of love.

54:22.538 --> 54:25.490
Time was I'd tell myself
that story over and over

54:25.491 --> 54:27.498
and hope such could be true.

54:29.526 --> 54:30.550
You see, I...

54:33.474 --> 54:34.510
I'm...

54:37.458 --> 54:38.579
You know I'm not a rich man.

54:40.490 --> 54:43.526
But what I cannot offer you
in wealth and luxury, I...

54:45.526 --> 54:49.545
Miss Rose, I offer you
my whole heart.

54:49.546 --> 54:51.533
For always.

54:51.534 --> 54:56.494
For when I look upon you,
I feel a mercy I thought lost to me.

54:57.518 --> 55:01.510
And I would work as hard as
any man is able, and harder...

55:01.511 --> 55:04.545
to provide every day
for your happiness

55:04.546 --> 55:07.545
and to be a better man,

55:07.546 --> 55:10.466
if you would...

55:11.474 --> 55:12.498
that is to say, if...

55:14.498 --> 55:19.494
if you might consider doing me the
utmost honour of being at my side.

55:24.498 --> 55:26.485
Oh, Bennet.

55:26.486 --> 55:28.513
That's so terribly...

55:28.514 --> 55:29.546
sweet.

55:32.534 --> 55:33.538
But...

55:35.546 --> 55:37.542
Well, you see, I just don't think...

55:39.510 --> 55:42.456
Well, there's a life
I have in mind for myself and...

55:42.457 --> 55:43.522
Miss Rose, please, forgive me...

55:43.523 --> 55:46.465
No! No, don't be sorry! You're...

55:46.466 --> 55:50.466
You're a lovely, lovely friend.

55:52.506 --> 55:54.514
But I can't be a bobby's housewife.

55:57.538 --> 55:59.454
Rose.

56:02.522 --> 56:08.529
I hope that you will always
be my friend, Bennet.

56:08.530 --> 56:10.522
You've a queue forming, girl.

56:41.542 --> 56:43.466
Sergeant.

56:45.466 --> 56:46.502
Sergeant Drake.

56:50.458 --> 56:51.538
No man's heart aches for ever.

56:51.539 --> 56:53.466
I promise you.

58:14.546 --> 58:18.493
Fire brands and ruffians
who must be brought to heel

58:18.494 --> 58:20.522
and the East End
is the root of it!

58:20.523 --> 58:23.493
I already have explosions
on my streets.

58:23.494 --> 58:25.478
You are an accessory to murder.

58:28.474 --> 58:29.550
Let it go, friend.

58:30.000 --> 58:59.883
