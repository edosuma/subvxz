00:24.275 --> 00:26.732

Oh, a cricket. I love crickets.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.651
Crickets are trouble. Noisy bugs.

01:59.745 --> 02:03.363
But they get to do whatever they want.
Hopping from place to place.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.614
-They're free.
-You're free.

02:05.710 --> 02:06.699
To do what we want.

02:06.794 --> 02:07.829
To be who you are.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.160
And you are who you are.

02:09.255 --> 02:10.745
Well, maybe lwant to
be something else.

02:11.048 --> 02:14.131
Maybe I don't want to steal.
Maybe I want to be good.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.298
All that from a cricket?

02:15.386 --> 02:17.126
Told you, trouble.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.961
"Good" is another word for "weak."

Let us do the thinking for you.

That's what parents are for.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.178

02:23.269 --> 02:25.555
You are who you are
and there's no changing it, Jiminy.

02:26.439 --> 02:27.645
-Right?
-Right.

02:27.732 --> 02:28.812
Right.

02:30.234 --> 02:33.397
Problem solved. (LAUGHS)

02:38.200 --> 02:39.451
You weren't always a cricket.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.817
I wasn't always...

02:42.246 --> 02:44.237
Oh, right. Because I'm...

02:45.624 --> 02:47.239
Because you think I'm Jiminy Cricket.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.327
Why do you think that, Henry?

02:51.422 --> 02:53.287
It's just because of who you are.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.337
And who am I?

02:54.425 --> 02:57.417
You're a conscience. You help people
see right from wrong.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.965
So all the crickets in Storybrooke,
they were once people, too?

03:03.017 --> 03:05.429

You've just never noticed.

03:15.321 --> 03:18.358
So you think that's proof
that there's a curse?

03:18.449 --> 03:21.691
Yes, but I know it's not enough.
I'm looking for more.

03:23.079 --> 03:27.038
Henry, look, I asked you this once
before and you said you'd think about it.

03:27.124 --> 03:30.616
Why do you think it's so important
that this is real?

03:33.464 --> 03:36.297
It... Itjust is.

03:37.510 --> 03:40.502
All right, well, keep thinking
about that answer, Henry.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.843

there's something buried there.

You know you don't have to dress a
woman as a man to give her authority.

So you think you can get people to do
what you want in that red coat?

03:53.526 --> 03:56.188
I'm getting you
to do what I want right now.

03:56.821 --> 03:57.901
Well, at least wear the badge.

People of Storybrooke,
don't be alarmed.

05:07.850 --> 05:11.138
We've always known this area was
honeycombed with old mining tunnels.

05:11.228 --> 05:15.892
But fear not, I'm going to undertake
a project to make this area safe,

05:16.233 --> 05:19.066

is part of some horrible plot.

27:30.650 --> 27:34.393
(SIGHING) It's like
I woke up in some strange land.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.487
Is anything coming back?

27:43.412 --> 27:46.996
What about when you're with her?
You remembered your dog.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.246
Yeah, I lied.

27:52.463 --> 27:53.964
You did?

27:54.382 --> 27:57.715
She's just so loving,
I didn't want to disappoint her.

28:00.263 --> 28:02.219
But none of it feels right.

28:02.306 --> 28:05.093
A dog named Ajax.
Who would name a dog that?

28:06.352 --> 28:08.968
None of it makes sense. None of it...

28:10.481 --> 28:12.312
None of it feels real.

28:13.943 --> 28:15.774
That sounds lonely.

28:17.864 --> 28:20.355
Actually, one thing does feel real.

28:21.784 --> 28:22.864
You.

28:24.537 --> 28:25.526
What?

28:25.621 --> 28:28.954
I know it's crazy, but I swear,
you're the only thing in this whole place

28:29.041 --> 28:32.454
that feels right.

28:39.844 --> 28:40.879
Kathryn.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.127
-Right.
-Kathryn.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.309
You're here.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.679
I know it's outside of visiting hours

28:51.230 --> 28:53.061
but I needed to see you.

28:54.817 --> 28:58.560
I made some cranberry muffins.
They used to be your favorite.

29:03.993 --> 29:04.982
I should leave you two.

29:06.704 --> 29:08.160
Wait, Mary Margaret.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.406
See you tomorrow?

29:19.675 --> 29:21.176
What was that?

29:21.260 --> 29:24.002
What the hell was that?
You said you could do this.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.085
Madam Mayor.

29:25.181 --> 29:26.512
They could've killed my son!

29:26.599 --> 29:29.090
I know. But this isn't helping.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.927
If we knew exactly where they were,
we could drill down to them.

29:32.021 --> 29:33.477
(DOG BARKING)

29:34.190 --> 29:36.852
Maybe rig something
to bring them back up.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.149
-But drill where?
-Come on, buddy.

29:48.454 --> 29:51.787
Look, this is where they must be.
What is it?

29:51.874 --> 29:53.375
Good boy.

30:03.511 --> 30:04.626
What is that?

30:04.720 --> 30:05.880
It's an air shaft.

30:13.771 --> 30:17.059
I'm really, really,

30:18.901 --> 30:20.232
really sorry.

30:22.488 --> 30:23.523
It's all right.

30:23.614 --> 30:26.731
I just wanted to find proof.

30:27.952 --> 30:29.943
It's really all right, Henry.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.570
I'm sorry, too.

30:35.918 --> 30:38.375
Look, I don't think you're crazy.

30:39.672 --> 30:42.709
ljust think that you got
a very strong mother

30:43.676 --> 30:47.760
who's got a clear idea of a path
that she wants you to be on

30:47.847 --> 30:52.011
and when you step off that
she gets scared.

30:52.101 --> 30:53.932
And that's natural.

30:57.231 --> 31:00.894
But it's also natural for you
to be able to be free

31:00.985 --> 31:03.818
to think the things
that you want to think.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.357
Anyway, I didn't mean those things I
said and I never should have said them.

31:10.453 --> 31:12.739
Then why did you?

31:16.459 --> 31:18.575
I guess I'm just not a very good person.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.129
I'm not the man I want to be.

31:43.194 --> 31:44.934
All right.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.238
So, what's next?

31:57.041 --> 31:58.781
I think you can be him.

31:59.168 --> 32:01.454
I think you can be a good person.

32:02.171 --> 32:03.877
I mean, you're Jiminy Cricket.

32:04.673 --> 32:08.916
Henry, Jiminy Cricket was a cricket,
okay?

32:09.011 --> 32:11.923
And he was a conscience.
And I hardly think that's me.

32:12.014 --> 32:14.505
But before he was that, he was a guy

32:14.600 --> 32:18.889
who took a long time to figure out
the right thing to do.

32:22.858 --> 32:24.689
That kind of sounds like me.

because of the curse.

32:51.387 --> 32:53.799
You need to lower someone
straight down,

or the line will collapse
the sides of the shaft.

-Lower me down.

for 10 years. I can do this.

that your fairy tale theory is true?

I don't know.

Because this can't be all there is.

33:58.996 --> 34:00.782
I understand.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.955
I thought if I found proof...

34:05.044 --> 34:06.875
But I didn't find anything.

-Don't test me.
-I don't need to.

Because you're gonna leave me alone
and let me do my work in peace.

36:51.919 --> 36:53.375
Really? Why is that?

36:53.462 --> 36:56.795
Because someday, Madam Mayor, you
may find yourself in a custody battle.

36:57.966 --> 37:01.458
And do you know how the court
determines who is a fit parent?

37:01.929 --> 37:06.844
They consult an expert. Particularly
one who has treated the child.
