<i>There are certain moments</i>

00:02.545 --> 00:04.379
<i>that are pregnant</i>

00:05.088 --> 00:06.422
<i>end of high school...</i>

00:06.456 --> 00:08.023
<i>the day we marry...</i>

00:08.058 --> 00:09.325
<i>the day we die.</i>

00:09.359 --> 00:11.727
<i>These are the times</i>
<i>we seem to be standing</i>

00:11.762 --> 00:13.729
<i>at destiny's crossroads,</i>

00:13.764 --> 00:16.565
<i>waiting for fate to deliver</i>
<i>the next bend in the road,</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:19.368
<i>waiting for a message</i>
<i>from above.</i>

00:19.403 --> 00:22.271
Mail's here!

00:22.306 --> 00:24.173
Anything for me?

00:24.207 --> 00:26.442
Uh, something from
Dart mouth, and it's thin.

00:26.476 --> 00:27.943
Ah. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

00:27.978 --> 00:29.111
You're very welcome!

00:29.146 --> 00:30.413
Whoa!

00:30.447 --> 00:32.415
What you got
there kiddo?

00:32.448 --> 00:35.418
Uh, something for you and Mom
with fancy writing on it.

00:35.452 --> 00:40.389
And for Mom, something
from your doctor.

00:40.424 --> 00:42.058
Which doctor?

00:42.092 --> 00:44.994
Witch doctor? Who said anything
about a witch doctor?
Yeah.

00:45.028 --> 00:47.029
You keep that up, I'm gonna
take you to a witch doctor.

00:47.064 --> 00:48.831
Really? Which
witch doctor?

00:48.865 --> 00:51.233
Hey, hey, looks like
we've just been invited

00:51.268 --> 00:53.369
to the wedding
of a Ms. Lynn DiNovi

00:53.403 --> 00:54.904
and a Mr. Lee Scanlon.

00:56.773 --> 00:58.174
Good news? Bad news? No news?

00:58.208 --> 01:01.677
Uh, just new insurance,
new rules.

01:01.712 --> 01:03.379
I'm never good at this stuff.

01:03.413 --> 01:05.147
Ariel?

01:05.182 --> 01:06.115
You all right?

01:06.149 --> 01:07.917
I got in! I got in!

01:07.951 --> 01:09.785
I got in. I got financial aid.

01:09.820 --> 01:10.953
I got in!

01:10.987 --> 01:12.188
You got in where?

01:12.222 --> 01:13.923
Dartmouth. Dartmouth!

01:13.957 --> 01:15.091
Dartmouth! Dartmouth!
Dartmouth!

01:15.125 --> 01:16.826
I got in,
my first choice, Dartmouth.

01:16.860 --> 01:17.893
Oh, my God, Dartmouth.

01:17.928 --> 01:19.862
Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you!

01:19.896 --> 01:21.130
<i>Just don't understand</i>

01:21.164 --> 01:23.532
why she has to go to college
in New Hampshire.

01:23.567 --> 01:25.835
Because that's
where Dartmouth is.

01:25.869 --> 01:28.971
Because that's where
she wants to go.

01:29.005 --> 01:32.675
Because it's time for us
to let her live her life.

01:32.709 --> 01:35.344
Hey, I got no problem
with her living her life.

01:35.379 --> 01:37.179
Just, why can't she do it here?

01:37.214 --> 01:38.814
You know, I grew up here.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.082
I went to college here.

01:40.117 --> 01:41.650
I'm perfectly happy.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.085
This letter's from your doctor.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.620
It's not about insurance.

01:44.654 --> 01:46.122
Where did you get that?

01:46.156 --> 01:47.690
From my pocket?

01:47.724 --> 01:49.458
According to this,
he needs to see you.

01:49.493 --> 01:51.127
He's concerned
about that piece of tumor

01:51.161 --> 01:52.595
he had to leave in your skull

01:52.629 --> 01:54.196
'cause it was attached
to your spine.

01:54.231 --> 01:56.565
Yeah, he's so concerned
that he wrote me a letter.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.068
I mean, he didn't call me,
he didn't e-mail me.

01:59.102 --> 02:00.736
I mean, he wrote me a letter.

02:00.771 --> 02:01.871
And you know what?

02:01.905 --> 02:03.005
It's not that urgent.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.907
If you read the whole thing,
you'll see.

02:04.941 --> 02:07.176
What he really wants is
for me to come in

02:07.210 --> 02:09.245
so they can try some new drug
on me.

02:09.279 --> 02:11.847
It's a solicitation
for test subjects.

02:11.882 --> 02:15.484
And I'm not sure how I feel
about <i>being</i> a test subject.

02:15.519 --> 02:17.653
Allison, we're talking
about a drug that...

02:17.687 --> 02:18.921
I'm reading now.

02:18.955 --> 02:20.890
"...virtually eliminates
the possibility

02:20.924 --> 02:23.459
"of seizure or death
sometimes associated

02:23.493 --> 02:25.161
with vestigial
cerebral growths."

02:25.195 --> 02:28.330
I think you'd at least want
to talk to somebody about that.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.732
Man, I do
want to talk

02:29.766 --> 02:32.468
to somebody about that,
but I'm not having seizures.

02:32.502 --> 02:35.704
I think I would know if I were
staring at imminent death.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.039
Listen, I promise you,

02:37.073 --> 02:38.941
on Monday,
I will call the doctor.

02:38.975 --> 02:40.810
I'll find out what's happening.

02:40.844 --> 02:43.279
Thank you.

02:43.313 --> 02:47.116
I'm just saying that I think
if we both take a position about

02:47.150 --> 02:48.851
Ariel going to school
closer to home,

02:48.885 --> 02:50.219
I think she might do it.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.654
Hey, look, I
heard you, Allison.

02:51.688 --> 02:54.123
Problem for me is that
that's not my position.

02:54.157 --> 02:55.391
Are you forgetting?

02:55.425 --> 02:56.625
I grew up in Michigan,

02:56.660 --> 02:58.861
and I moved to Phoenix
to study engineering,

02:58.895 --> 03:01.030
thousands of miles
away from home.

03:01.064 --> 03:02.298
And thank God I did.

03:02.332 --> 03:04.433
Otherwise, how else
would I have met you?

03:04.468 --> 03:07.636
Now, if she wants to move to
New Hampshire to go to school,

03:07.671 --> 03:09.572
I think we should
encourage her to go.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.407
Am I gonna miss
her? Absolutely.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.609
But I couldn't be
more excited for her.

03:13.643 --> 03:14.844
Now, come on.

03:14.878 --> 03:18.781
Tell me you're going to
get on board with this.

03:20.050 --> 03:23.018
What? Stop looking at me
like I'm some kind of ghoul.

03:23.053 --> 03:24.820
I love my daughter.

03:24.855 --> 03:26.088
Am I excited for?

03:26.122 --> 03:28.757
Hey, you know what?
I'm more than excited for her.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.460
Am I ready for her
to move across country? No.

03:31.495 --> 03:35.598
Am I ready to not see her
for days or weeks

03:35.632 --> 03:37.233
or months at a time?

03:37.267 --> 03:39.001
No. I would rather die!

03:39.035 --> 03:40.769
It's not
about you!
Hey, you know what?

03:40.804 --> 03:43.072
She was accepted
to three other schools,

03:43.106 --> 03:44.740
all of them a lot closer.

03:44.774 --> 03:47.643
And that's where I want her,
a lot closer, and if...

03:47.677 --> 03:50.179
You know what? If that makes me
an awful person,

03:50.213 --> 03:52.114
I can live with that.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.449
Come on, Allison.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.584
You come on.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.194
Oh.

04:08.565 --> 04:10.966
Whoa.

04:14.037 --> 04:16.872
This is nice.

04:16.906 --> 04:19.642
I don't remember
you waking up once.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.177
I don't think
you had a dream all night.

04:22.212 --> 04:24.713
When was the last time
that happened?

04:26.950 --> 04:29.051
Um...

04:29.085 --> 04:32.154
Al, you awake?

04:32.188 --> 04:34.323
Honey, the alarm went off.

04:35.425 --> 04:37.560
Al?

04:41.064 --> 04:43.265
Al?

04:44.534 --> 04:46.135
Al.

04:47.571 --> 04:48.837
Al?

04:48.872 --> 04:50.906
Al!

04:50.941 --> 04:52.374
Al!

04:53.944 --> 04:56.445
Al!

07:12.256 --> 07:14.791
I filled the trays with water
again 20 minutes ago.

07:14.826 --> 07:16.860
And you'd think,
out of respect for Mommy,

07:16.894 --> 07:18.729
these people would drink
their damn liquor

07:18.763 --> 07:19.830
at room temperature.

07:19.864 --> 07:22.299
Hey.

07:23.201 --> 07:25.268
Come here.

07:45.890 --> 07:48.425
Um... Daddy.

07:48.459 --> 07:50.127
Sorry.
Excuse me.

07:52.730 --> 07:54.865
Yeah. What
is it, honey?

07:56.567 --> 07:58.668
Nothing.

08:10.915 --> 08:12.983
You doing all right?

08:13.017 --> 08:15.886
It's a lot to get used to.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.687
My name's Mary-Louise.

08:17.722 --> 08:20.457
I heard about
what happened to you, and...

08:20.491 --> 08:23.493
I, um... I live in Phoenix.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.229
Lived in Phoenix.

08:26.264 --> 08:27.731
I read about you.

08:27.765 --> 08:28.965
I know who you are.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.168
I just... thought I'd look in.

08:31.202 --> 08:33.068
See if you were making
the adjustment okay.

08:33.104 --> 08:34.837
So,  you're...?

08:34.871 --> 08:37.674
Dead? Mm.

08:37.707 --> 08:39.676
Four days.

08:39.710 --> 08:42.679
I think I'm supposed
to have moved on by now.

08:42.712 --> 08:46.917
Don't think they like
you hanging around.

08:46.951 --> 08:48.385
I don't know.

08:48.419 --> 08:51.755
I just, um... think
I'm a little scared.

08:51.789 --> 08:54.958
The whole final destination
thing makes me a little uneasy.

08:56.160 --> 09:00.530
I wasn't a bad person,
but I was no angel, either.

09:02.166 --> 09:05.302
Besides, once
you get over the shock--

09:05.336 --> 09:06.803
this, being dead,
hanging around--

09:06.838 --> 09:09.739
it's not the worst thing
in the world.

09:13.077 --> 09:15.245
Besides, I kind of
want to make sure

09:15.279 --> 09:17.747
the police catch the bastard
who did this to me.

09:17.782 --> 09:20.550
Are you saying
you were murdered?

09:24.555 --> 09:26.656
Ugh.

09:30.795 --> 09:33.530
Can I show you something,
please?

09:35.299 --> 09:38.368
<i>Can you see him?</i>

09:38.402 --> 09:40.704
<i>His name's Clarence,</i>
<i>Clarence Denton.</i>

09:40.738 --> 09:43.974
<i>Apparently, he's been in</i>
<i>and out of prison.</i>

09:44.008 --> 09:46.843
<i>Rape, assault. Lovely man.</i>

09:46.878 --> 09:49.479
<i>I guess he'd been watching me</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

09:49.513 --> 09:51.514
<i>I was on my computer</i>
<i>in the den.</i>

09:51.549 --> 09:53.016
<i>Heard this noise</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

09:53.050 --> 09:55.018
<i>I went in to see what it was,</i>

09:55.052 --> 09:58.221
<i>and he came up behind me</i>
<i>and strangled me with a belt.</i>

09:58.256 --> 10:01.191
<i>I still have no idea</i>
<i>how he got in my house.</i>

10:01.259 --> 10:03.994
<i>Then he put his hands</i>
<i>all over me,</i>

10:04.028 --> 10:06.162
<i>did all kinds of things to me.</i>

10:06.197 --> 10:08.231
<i>Now watch this.</i>

10:08.266 --> 10:10.800
Supper time.

10:10.835 --> 10:12.369
<i>Oh my God.</i>

10:12.403 --> 10:14.371
<i>Her name is Shannon Mitchell.</i>

10:14.405 --> 10:17.440
<i>I think he grabbed her</i>
<i>in Tempe two nights ago.</i>

10:17.475 --> 10:20.677
<i>Anyway, you get the idea.</i>

10:22.513 --> 10:24.347
So now you know.

10:24.382 --> 10:27.517
Ever since I died,
that's what I've been doing.

10:27.551 --> 10:29.252
Watching him.

10:29.287 --> 10:32.555
Trying to figure out
what to do about it all.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.591
And then I heard about you.

10:34.625 --> 10:36.493
I... I know it's crazy.

10:36.527 --> 10:38.962
You're as dead as I am.

10:38.996 --> 10:41.698
But I guess I was just
kind of hoping.

10:43.668 --> 10:46.202
Any-hoo...

10:46.237 --> 10:51.775
I feel better now that
I've told somebody.

10:51.809 --> 10:53.610
I'm gonna leave you
to your family.

10:53.644 --> 10:56.012
Let you get your bearings.

10:57.782 --> 11:01.418
Mary-Louise.

11:01.452 --> 11:04.988
You're the first new friend
I've made in the hereafter.

11:09.260 --> 11:11.461
Ariel?

11:14.265 --> 11:15.966
Ariel?

11:17.535 --> 11:21.237
Hi, Mom.

11:21.272 --> 11:23.673
Hi...

11:23.708 --> 11:25.675
my darling.

11:25.710 --> 11:28.812
You look nice.

11:30.247 --> 11:34.484
Maybe I can just do this

11:34.518 --> 11:36.653
lay here...

11:36.687 --> 11:38.488
dream about you.

11:38.522 --> 11:41.191
Okay.

11:41.225 --> 11:42.726
We can do that.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.528
No.

11:45.563 --> 11:49.065
At some point,
I'm gonna need to wake up.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.767
Ariel...

11:50.801 --> 11:53.036
you <i>are</i> awake.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.776
Ariel...

11:59.810 --> 12:02.379
you <i>are</i> awake.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.748
I <i>am</i> here.

12:04.782 --> 12:07.117
No...

12:07.151 --> 12:09.686
Honey, you remember last night?

12:09.720 --> 12:13.656
You saw me
outside the kitchen window?

12:13.691 --> 12:16.126
I saw you, too.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.795
Daddy doesn't see me.

12:18.829 --> 12:21.498
You sisters can't see me.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.932
But you can.

12:22.967 --> 12:25.135
But-but-but...

12:25.169 --> 12:26.803
I don't know.

12:26.837 --> 12:28.972
I mean, is this how
it's supposed to be?

12:29.006 --> 12:31.341
But aren't you supposed
to go some other place?

12:31.375 --> 12:35.278
Some other <i>wonderful</i> place?

12:35.312 --> 12:37.580
Look, it's not...

12:37.615 --> 12:40.383
it's not that
I don't want you here,

12:40.418 --> 12:45.789
because I do, forever...

12:45.823 --> 12:49.159
t how am I supposed
to explain this to Dad?

12:49.193 --> 12:53.630
Honey, tell Daddy,
tell him I am fine.

12:53.664 --> 12:55.498
Tell him I feel good,

12:55.533 --> 12:58.868
that I'm in no pain, okay?

12:58.903 --> 13:01.938
You tell him he's my everything,

13:01.972 --> 13:04.674
he's the great love of my life,

13:04.708 --> 13:06.209
and that I'm watching over him.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.078
I think that'll make him happy.

13:09.680 --> 13:13.883
And your sisters, sweetie,
please,

13:13.918 --> 13:17.153
tell your sisters
that I love them,

13:17.188 --> 13:19.989
that I'm so proud of them,

13:20.024 --> 13:25.328
and that I am with them
in their lives still.

13:25.362 --> 13:27.697
And that goes for you too,
Ariel,

13:27.731 --> 13:30.400
my big girl.

13:30.434 --> 13:33.269
My beautiful girl.

13:33.304 --> 13:38.741
I am with you
for as long as you need me.

13:41.445 --> 13:46.082
Oh, honey, I need you
to do something for me.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.684
I met this woman.

13:47.718 --> 13:50.520
She gave me some information
about the man who murdered her.

13:50.554 --> 13:52.655
About the man who murdered her?

13:52.690 --> 13:53.857
That's right.

13:53.891 --> 13:56.626
He's got a girl
he's holding hostage.

13:56.660 --> 13:57.894
Okay.

13:57.928 --> 14:00.597
You'll need to get
a pen and paper.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.365
I'm gonna give you some names.

14:02.399 --> 14:04.601
You'll need to get them
to the district attorney.

14:05.536 --> 14:08.071
Ariel, baby,

14:08.105 --> 14:10.773
pen and paper?

14:12.676 --> 14:14.344
Uh, backpack.

14:14.378 --> 14:16.279
Uh, kitchen.

14:20.217 --> 14:21.351
Um...

14:24.855 --> 14:27.991
Hey. How're we doing
this morning?

14:28.025 --> 14:29.492
We're doing.

14:31.562 --> 14:34.264
Hey, honey, you seem
a little manic.

14:34.298 --> 14:36.065
I know this is hard.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.268
I know this is like
the worst thing ever.

14:38.302 --> 14:40.603
Hey, come on.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

14:40.638 --> 14:42.705
I want to tell
you something.

14:42.740 --> 14:44.707
Hey, no, wait,
wait, wait.

14:44.742 --> 14:49.946
Your Mom is actually here...
right now.

14:49.980 --> 14:51.781
She's watching all of us.

14:51.815 --> 14:53.449
She's watching you.

14:53.484 --> 14:55.818
She's proud of you.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.288
Don't ask me
how, but I know.

15:03.093 --> 15:04.127
What?

15:04.161 --> 15:07.630
You look like you want
to say something.

15:07.665 --> 15:09.632
Where does Mom keep the pens?

15:12.069 --> 15:14.037
Right in the drawer.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.041
Thanks!

15:27.674 --> 15:29.476
<i>So, we're all dying to hear.</i>

15:29.626 --> 15:32.294
What's the temperature like
in New Hampshire?

15:32.329 --> 15:33.996
31 degrees.

15:34.031 --> 15:35.431
And it's homecoming weekend.

15:35.465 --> 15:36.532
What's that?

15:36.566 --> 15:37.566
It's nothing.

15:37.601 --> 15:39.702
It doesn't matter.

15:39.736 --> 15:40.703
I'm not going to Dartmouth.

15:40.737 --> 15:41.804
I'm going to Mesa.

15:41.838 --> 15:42.938
And Mesa doesn't have
homecoming,

15:42.973 --> 15:44.206
so just forget about it.

15:44.241 --> 15:46.609
Hey, Bridge, Marie,
go to your room.

15:46.643 --> 15:47.943
Get your stuff together.

15:47.978 --> 15:49.645
We're leaving
in five minutes.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.081
Hey, Bridge,
did you have Daddy sign
that permission slip?

15:52.115 --> 15:53.282
How do you know about that?

15:53.316 --> 15:55.317
What difference does it
make how I know about it?

15:55.352 --> 15:56.719
If you don't hand
that slip in today,

15:56.753 --> 15:57.987
you're not going
on that trip.

15:58.021 --> 15:59.789
That's not fair.

15:59.823 --> 16:01.924
Just get the slip, Bridge.

16:06.096 --> 16:07.663
So how's your mom?

16:11.001 --> 16:12.702
She's fine.

16:12.736 --> 16:14.570
She misses you.

16:16.940 --> 16:19.341
She here?

16:19.376 --> 16:20.643
Now?

16:21.945 --> 16:24.146
No. When I woke up this morning,

16:24.181 --> 16:26.348
she gave me a whole list
of crimes and criminals

16:26.383 --> 16:27.783
to tell the D.A. about.

16:27.818 --> 16:29.452
She made me promise
to get on Bridge

16:29.486 --> 16:31.020
about that permission
slip, and

16:31.054 --> 16:33.622
I'm supposed to tell you that
Marie's still having bad dreams,

16:33.657 --> 16:36.092
and that maybe she should sleep
in your bed tonight.

16:37.427 --> 16:41.197
You know, I would've figured
that out eventually--

16:41.231 --> 16:44.066
about Marie-- and Bridge,
I know it's mean,

16:44.101 --> 16:46.368
but maybe she should have
missed the field trip.

16:46.403 --> 16:48.871
And maybe next time she'd know
to get the slip signed.

16:48.905 --> 16:51.941
I'm just saying,
if you went to Dartmouth...
You know what?

16:51.975 --> 16:53.476
You're right, Dad.
And what about that man

16:53.510 --> 16:54.777
that Mom told me about
that's gonna stuff

16:54.811 --> 16:56.545
a nine-year old boy
into the trunk of his car

16:56.580 --> 16:57.480
the day after tomorrow?

16:57.514 --> 16:58.447
Am I not supposed

16:58.482 --> 16:59.715
to tell the DA
about that, too?

16:59.750 --> 17:01.617
Am I maybe just supposed
to let that happen?

17:01.651 --> 17:03.119
I don't know, Ariel.

17:03.153 --> 17:06.122
I'm just worried about you.

17:06.156 --> 17:08.022
I know that
from where your Mom is,

17:08.058 --> 17:09.258
she sees all kinds of things,

17:09.291 --> 17:10.992
that she knows
all kinds of things.

17:11.027 --> 17:16.632
And maybe, maybe she does know
what's best.

17:16.665 --> 17:18.701
But still,
I'm worried about you.

17:19.770 --> 17:22.371
Dad, are we going or not?!

17:28.912 --> 17:30.679
<i>Her name's Amanda Tillman.</i>

17:30.714 --> 17:34.784
A maid at the Robin's Nest Motel
found her this morning.

17:34.818 --> 17:37.753
I'm sorry.

17:37.788 --> 17:39.722
My mom came to visit me
this morning,

17:39.756 --> 17:41.624
but she didn't say anything
about this.

17:41.658 --> 17:45.728
Oh, well, your mom and you
have spoiled me.

17:45.762 --> 17:48.364
I guess
I can't expect every case

17:48.398 --> 17:51.200
to be handed to me
on a silver platter.

17:51.234 --> 17:53.702
Ariel...

17:53.737 --> 17:56.272
you know that day
that you came in here

17:56.306 --> 17:57.907
and you told me
about Clarence Denton?

17:57.941 --> 17:59.408
The man
who was holding the girl--

17:59.442 --> 18:01.477
the one who killed the woman
my mother met

18:01.511 --> 18:02.778
shortly after she died?

18:02.813 --> 18:08.284
The man, as it turned out,
who killed all those women, yes.

18:08.318 --> 18:09.652
Ever since that day,

18:09.686 --> 18:13.255
I've felt
a little guilty.

18:13.290 --> 18:16.492
Having your mom work here
all those years

18:16.526 --> 18:17.860
was an incredible gift.

18:17.894 --> 18:20.496
And having her continue to
help us even after her passing,

18:20.530 --> 18:22.965
it... it seems almost
too good to be true.

18:22.999 --> 18:27.670
And sometimes I worry that it's
all happening at your expense.

18:27.704 --> 18:32.374
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't want to be.

18:34.010 --> 18:37.012
So, lunch.

18:37.047 --> 18:38.581
Ah, time for this diabetic

18:38.615 --> 18:40.916
to give himself a shot
of insulin.

18:40.951 --> 18:41.984
All right, then.

18:42.018 --> 18:44.620
Do you mind if I use
my mom's old desk

18:44.654 --> 18:45.921
to get some schoolwork done?

18:45.956 --> 18:47.590
Not at all. Be my guest.

18:47.624 --> 18:49.225
Thank you.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.458
What's wrong?!

19:31.301 --> 19:35.504
It's quite a turnout.

19:35.538 --> 19:39.341
Allison, I was hoping
you'd be stopping by.

19:42.045 --> 19:43.979
Insulin overdose.

19:44.014 --> 19:47.449
Never saw
that coming.

19:47.484 --> 19:48.617
Hmm.

19:49.586 --> 19:51.453
I've been with her
every second

19:51.488 --> 19:54.323
these past few days,
watching her cry,

19:54.357 --> 19:57.259
not being able to hold her,
not being able to tell her

19:57.294 --> 19:59.628
that everything's
gonna be okay.

19:59.663 --> 20:02.464
How did you deal with that?

20:02.499 --> 20:05.601
For me, it's a
little different.

20:05.635 --> 20:09.838
I can talk to
Ariel, which means
I can talk to Joe.

20:12.342 --> 20:13.442
Well, you know,
that's why

20:13.476 --> 20:15.844
she's working
at your office.

20:17.814 --> 20:19.748
You should know, though,

20:19.783 --> 20:21.750
that my successor's
already been appointed.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.085
Her name is Kelly Shuler.

20:23.119 --> 20:26.288
But to be honest with
you, I have no idea

20:26.323 --> 20:29.024
if she'll be open to
working with you and Ariel.

20:29.059 --> 20:30.726
Don't you worry
about that.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.295
Let me worry about that.

20:35.398 --> 20:40.336
Listen... I know that
you can't talk to Lily.

20:40.370 --> 20:43.138
So if there's
any last words,

20:43.173 --> 20:46.976
anything at all you
want to say, please,

20:47.010 --> 20:51.013
Ariel and I are
happy to help.

20:52.115 --> 20:53.282
No.

20:53.316 --> 20:54.583
Thank you.

20:54.617 --> 20:56.118
She knows how I feel.

20:56.152 --> 20:57.319
When I was alive,

20:57.354 --> 21:00.456
I made it a point of
telling her every single day.

21:00.490 --> 21:03.926
Now she just needs
to get on with her life.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.628
I owe her that.

21:13.570 --> 21:15.637
Hey, I'm turning in.

21:15.672 --> 21:17.573
You all right?

21:17.607 --> 21:20.843
Just studying for a midterm.

21:20.877 --> 21:22.211
Um, all right.

21:22.245 --> 21:23.746
Don't stay up too late.

21:26.049 --> 21:27.716
Good night, Daddy.

21:27.751 --> 21:29.618
He's getting so thin.

21:29.652 --> 21:31.653
He's not eating enough.

21:31.688 --> 21:34.823
Don't worry.
I'll get him to eat more.

21:34.858 --> 21:38.961
Maybe I'll, uh,
make some pasta this weekend.

21:42.032 --> 21:44.600
Honey, have you heard
about this new D.A.?

21:44.634 --> 21:46.902
Of course.

21:46.936 --> 21:49.071
Well, have you
given any thought

21:49.105 --> 21:51.273
about how you're
going to approach her...

21:51.307 --> 21:52.975
what you're
going to say?

21:53.009 --> 21:55.844
You know, she might not
be as open to working with us

21:55.879 --> 21:57.546
as Devalos was.

21:59.182 --> 22:04.286
Actually, I wasn't
going to approach her.

22:04.320 --> 22:09.725
I thought maybe now is as good
a time as any to, you know,

22:09.759 --> 22:12.661
pay more attention to school.

22:12.695 --> 22:14.596
Maybe transfer to Dartmouth.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.401
What?

22:21.738 --> 22:23.939
Have you looked
at that lately?

22:26.509 --> 22:27.742
Mom, I...

22:27.744 --> 22:28.944
Come on, open it

22:39.556 --> 22:41.657
Every page
in that book

22:41.691 --> 22:45.027
is a person whose
life we've saved

22:45.061 --> 22:46.695
or a criminal that
we've put in jail.

22:46.729 --> 22:49.164
That man there,
Clarence Denton, without us

22:49.199 --> 22:52.334
he would have gotten away with
murdering Mary-Louise Graff.

22:52.368 --> 22:54.536
And that young girl
he kidnapped?

22:54.571 --> 22:56.405
She would be dead right now

22:56.439 --> 22:58.540
instead of at home
with her family.

23:03.580 --> 23:07.883
Okay. I'll talk to her tomorrow.

23:07.917 --> 23:11.954
But right now, I need to study,
and then I need to sleep.

23:11.988 --> 23:14.189
<i>Someone here?</i>

23:15.091 --> 23:18.727
Hello?

23:18.761 --> 23:21.029
Warren, is that you?

23:21.064 --> 23:23.198
Are you home, darling?

23:23.233 --> 23:24.233
No, don't.

23:24.267 --> 23:27.369
It's better
in the dark.

23:28.571 --> 23:30.639
Warren's not here.

23:30.673 --> 23:32.441
No one's here.

23:32.475 --> 23:35.377
It's just
you... and me.

23:35.411 --> 23:38.113
Yeah.

23:38.148 --> 23:39.648
Yeah, there.

23:39.682 --> 23:42.117
I have a feeling
you're gonna like this.

23:55.565 --> 23:57.399
Oh, Mom...

23:57.433 --> 23:59.902
He's not the one
who murdered her.

24:03.714 --> 24:06.646
I don't understand why
you're showing me this.

24:07.066 --> 24:10.569
The murder of Mary-Louise Graff
is a closed case.

24:11.204 --> 24:14.706
In fact, you closed it,
didn't you?

24:14.741 --> 24:18.810
Uh, Clarence Denton confessed
to everything, didn't he?

24:18.845 --> 24:20.545
He did.

24:20.580 --> 24:21.947
Hmm.

24:21.981 --> 24:25.083
But he was guilty of
a lot of other crimes.

24:25.118 --> 24:27.152
I mean, remember that girl
that he kidnapped and tortured?

24:27.186 --> 24:28.920
You could get the death penalty
for that alone.

24:28.955 --> 24:31.323
So when they said that they'd
take execution off the table

24:31.357 --> 24:33.291
if he confessed to the murder
of Mary-Louise Graff,

24:33.326 --> 24:34.993
he jumped at it.

24:35.027 --> 24:37.062
I mean, he would have said
he shot President Kennedy

24:37.096 --> 24:39.164
if he knew that he could
avoid the needle.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.403
Look at this.

24:44.437 --> 24:48.173
This woman was found hanging
by a noose in a hotel room.

24:48.207 --> 24:51.243
Makes two women in one week.

24:51.277 --> 24:53.578
This is a case
that needs my attention.

24:53.613 --> 24:57.282
This is a case
that needs closing.

24:57.316 --> 24:59.785
That's all, Ariel.

25:06.392 --> 25:08.326
You're making a huge mistake.

25:10.129 --> 25:12.631
I just want to help you.

25:15.535 --> 25:20.038
You're young, you're beautiful,
you're smart.

25:20.072 --> 25:23.175
Why aren't you out having
the time of your life?

25:23.209 --> 25:24.843
Why on earth would you want

25:24.877 --> 25:27.412
to spend your days
working in this office?

25:28.514 --> 25:29.848
You know what?

25:29.882 --> 25:31.216
I am going to help you.

25:32.318 --> 25:36.254
I am going to do you
the biggest favor of your life.

25:36.289 --> 25:37.756
I'm giving you notice.

25:37.790 --> 25:39.558
30 days from today you're fired.

25:39.592 --> 25:41.293
This is the last month
that you will work

25:41.327 --> 25:42.627
in the district
attorney's office.

25:42.662 --> 25:44.830
And you know what, Ariel?

25:44.864 --> 25:47.833
One of these days,
you will thank me.

25:47.867 --> 25:49.067
So go.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.221
Where are you going?

26:10.490 --> 26:12.991
To school, Mom.

26:13.025 --> 26:14.226
To school.

26:14.260 --> 26:15.427
Because that's where I belong.

26:15.461 --> 26:17.229
That's where I'm supposed to be.

26:17.263 --> 26:19.664
So that I can grow up.
So that I can be an adult.

26:19.699 --> 26:21.566
So that one day,
I can tell someone like me

26:21.601 --> 26:22.734
how little they know

26:22.768 --> 26:24.436
and what they should be doing
with their life.

26:24.470 --> 26:26.004
What about Mary-Louise Graff?

26:26.038 --> 26:27.639
What about her?! She's dead.

26:27.673 --> 26:30.308
I mean, isn't she the one
who got us into this?

26:30.343 --> 26:32.978
Wasn't she the one who was sure
that Clarence Denton killed her?

26:33.012 --> 26:36.214
Yes, but...
Yes, but that's not what I saw
in my dream.

26:36.249 --> 26:38.984
Okay, the fact is, she told me
her killer came up behind her.

26:39.018 --> 26:40.952
I guess she didn't get
a good look at him.

26:40.987 --> 26:44.856
I can't explain why she thought
Denton did it.

26:44.891 --> 26:46.625
I am sorry.

26:46.659 --> 26:49.327
But the fact remains,
her killer is still out there.

26:49.362 --> 26:50.862
And you know what he looks like.

26:50.897 --> 26:52.297
You even have a picture of him.

26:52.331 --> 26:55.700
Mom, the woman fired me.

26:55.735 --> 26:57.669
Yes, but you still have a month.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.138
Honey, come on, a month
is plenty of time

27:00.172 --> 27:02.774
to show her how useful
you can be.

27:02.808 --> 27:05.477
That's plenty of time
to change her mind.

27:05.511 --> 27:07.546
We just have to put
a name to that face.

27:07.580 --> 27:09.915
We just have to find out
who killed Mary-Louise.

27:09.949 --> 27:13.184
Mom, I have a test.

27:13.219 --> 27:14.886
Oh, Honey, I know.

27:14.921 --> 27:17.956
I just need you to make
one little stop

27:17.990 --> 27:19.024
on your way to school.

27:19.058 --> 27:20.725
<i>This doesn't make any sense.</i>

27:20.760 --> 27:23.161
They caught the man
who murdered my wife.

27:23.195 --> 27:25.730
He's been in jail,
for some time now.

27:25.765 --> 27:28.199
I was actually hoping
that you'd be willing

27:28.234 --> 27:31.436
to look at composite
sketch of a new suspect.

27:48.621 --> 27:51.222
This is a joke.

27:52.992 --> 27:55.894
You're playing some sort
of sick joke on me.

27:55.928 --> 27:58.396
I promise you, Mr. Graff,
this isn't...

27:58.431 --> 28:00.498
YOUNG MAN:
Hey, I'm going out
for a bit, Dad.

28:00.533 --> 28:03.401
Don't wait on me for dinner,
okay? Ooh...

28:03.436 --> 28:06.071
I didn't know
you had company.

28:06.105 --> 28:08.340
How's it going? I'm Ryan.

28:08.374 --> 28:09.975
Yeah, there.

28:10.009 --> 28:12.077
I have a feeling
you're gonna like this.

28:23.589 --> 28:26.591
His name is Ryan Graff.

28:26.626 --> 28:29.127
He's Mary-Louise Graff's
stepson.

28:29.161 --> 28:31.162
He's the one who murdered her.

28:31.197 --> 28:33.264
I see.

28:33.299 --> 28:38.470
And you know this
because he confessed it?

28:38.504 --> 28:40.338
Or, no, no, wait, um,

28:40.373 --> 28:44.743
you saw it or, or, no,
you-you dreamt it.

28:46.879 --> 28:49.581
Well, that means
it must be true.

28:49.615 --> 28:52.684
And I know that you know this,

28:52.718 --> 28:56.821
but I-I can't admit a dream
as evidence in court.

28:56.856 --> 28:58.623
I can't put it on the stand.

28:58.658 --> 29:00.425
I can't submit it
to cross-examination.

29:00.459 --> 29:04.596
And since there's virtually
no forensic evidence left

29:04.630 --> 29:07.232
at the scene
of Mary-Louise's murder,

29:07.266 --> 29:11.236
your theory about her stepson
is really a waste of my time.

29:13.239 --> 29:15.106
You know what? Forget
what I said this morning.

29:15.141 --> 29:17.509
Today was your last day.

29:17.543 --> 29:19.344
I will have someone
pack up your things

29:19.378 --> 29:22.347
and get them to your house
tomorrow.

29:22.381 --> 29:24.949
Now you have a nice evening.

29:24.984 --> 29:29.521
MARY-LOUISE
<i>North...</i>

29:29.555 --> 29:30.822
<i>North.</i>

29:30.856 --> 29:34.192
North!

29:38.130 --> 29:43.902
Oh, God! Ryan, you cannot
keep ignoring our safe word.

29:43.936 --> 29:46.204
That's why it's there--
to keep me safe.

29:46.238 --> 29:48.840
I say the word,
you're supposed to stop.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.508
I don't want to stop.

29:50.543 --> 29:53.745
It only gets really
good towards the end.

29:53.779 --> 29:58.049
It only gets really good
when it seems like you're
about to slip away.

29:58.084 --> 30:01.352
Don't say that.

30:01.387 --> 30:03.121
You're scaring me.

30:03.155 --> 30:05.423
Good.

30:05.458 --> 30:09.294
Good. I want to scare you.

30:09.328 --> 30:11.796
It should be scary.

30:11.831 --> 30:15.433
It's the only way
that it will work.

30:15.468 --> 30:18.336
That's the point.

30:18.370 --> 30:21.339
Really? That's the point?

30:21.373 --> 30:24.309
God, I thought it
was scary enough.

30:24.343 --> 30:26.644
You're my husband's son.

30:26.679 --> 30:28.113
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:28.147 --> 30:31.216
It doesn't work
for me anymore.

30:33.352 --> 30:35.820
You wait.

30:35.855 --> 30:38.556
Someday...

30:38.591 --> 30:41.626
I'm going to sneak up
behind you

30:41.660 --> 30:44.929
in the dark...

30:44.964 --> 30:49.000
and there won't be...
a safe word.

30:49.034 --> 30:51.069
Oh.

30:51.103 --> 30:53.838
No, there won't be
any safety at all.

30:56.909 --> 30:59.978
Mary-Louise was having
an affair with her stepson.

31:02.615 --> 31:04.816
You saw it, too.

31:04.850 --> 31:06.985
Listen, honey, I need you
to do something for me.

31:07.019 --> 31:08.653
I need you to call
Detective Scanlon

31:08.687 --> 31:10.088
and tell him what you know.

31:10.122 --> 31:14.192
Why? What do I know?

31:14.226 --> 31:15.894
I think this whole preoccupation

31:15.928 --> 31:18.730
with sex and asphyxiation
is important.

31:18.764 --> 31:22.300
I mean, think about it--
all the girls who were murdered,

31:22.334 --> 31:24.602
weren't they found hanging
from belts?

31:24.637 --> 31:26.304
I think there might
be a connection.

31:26.338 --> 31:29.174
I'm done, Mom.

31:29.208 --> 31:30.942
What?

31:30.976 --> 31:33.878
I'm not calling anybody.

31:33.913 --> 31:35.246
I'm not doing anything.

31:35.281 --> 31:37.615
What I just dreamt
doesn't make any difference.

31:37.650 --> 31:40.752
And I already told the new D.A.
who I think it is that did this,

31:40.786 --> 31:42.187
and she doesn't care.

31:42.221 --> 31:44.088
Well, we'll make her care.

31:44.123 --> 31:45.657
Call Detective Scanlon.

31:45.691 --> 31:47.959
You call Detective Scanlon.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.794
You investigate this.

31:49.829 --> 31:51.963
I can't do that.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.665
I am dead.

31:53.699 --> 31:55.967
Well, then act like it.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.703
Leave me alone.

31:58.737 --> 32:00.738
Crawl back into your grave,

32:00.773 --> 32:03.341
and I will come visit you
on Mother's Day and Christmas.

32:09.348 --> 32:11.482
Ariel!

32:11.517 --> 32:13.418
I mean it, Mom.
I am done.

32:13.452 --> 32:15.753
I am packing my bags
tomorrow morning,

32:15.788 --> 32:18.389
and I am going to find a college
that I want to go to.

32:18.424 --> 32:19.657
And then I'll get a job

32:19.692 --> 32:21.359
so I can work my way
through school.

32:21.393 --> 32:22.493
What are you talking about?

32:22.528 --> 32:24.128
What college?
Are you talking about Dartmouth?

32:24.163 --> 32:25.396
I don't know, Mom,

32:25.431 --> 32:27.232
but I'm certainly
not telling you.

32:27.266 --> 32:29.534
I am tired of running away
from my future.

32:29.568 --> 32:31.336
It's about time
that I start running towards it,

32:31.370 --> 32:33.004
no matter how far from here
it is!

32:33.038 --> 32:34.672
Don't drink that!

32:34.707 --> 32:35.807
This is insane!

32:35.841 --> 32:37.976
No matter where you go,
I will follow you.

32:38.010 --> 32:39.244
Well, then I'll move again.

32:39.278 --> 32:40.678
What about your father,
your sisters?

32:40.713 --> 32:43.414
They're gonna wake up and
you're just gonna be gone?

32:43.449 --> 32:45.516
You can blame yourself for that.

32:45.551 --> 32:47.151
Stop that, Ariel!

32:47.186 --> 32:48.686
You are too young
to drink!

32:48.721 --> 32:49.821
What are you doing?!

32:49.855 --> 32:51.422
Isn't this why
you started drinking?

32:51.457 --> 32:53.524
So that you'd get rid
of the ghosts?

32:53.559 --> 32:56.761
Because there is one ghost
that I am tired of listening to.

32:56.795 --> 32:59.831
Ariel, what are you saying?!

32:59.865 --> 33:01.933
You are breaking my heart!

33:04.169 --> 33:06.137
Oh, my goodness.

33:07.473 --> 33:10.174
It's really working.

33:12.411 --> 33:14.679
I can't see you anymore.

33:16.782 --> 33:18.816
I can barely hear you.

33:22.688 --> 33:23.788
Oh, wow...

33:25.958 --> 33:27.625
No, Ariel!

33:27.660 --> 33:29.127
Ariel, listen to me!

33:29.161 --> 33:30.228
You can't leave me!

33:30.262 --> 33:33.031
You can't leave
this house!

33:36.502 --> 33:38.403
Bye, Mommy.

33:40.973 --> 33:43.041
I gotta go now.

33:50.712 --> 33:53.581
<i>Dear Dad,</i>
<i>I know you'll understand,</i>

33:54.727 --> 33:57.363
<i>although I imagine you'll</i>
<i>find it hard to forgive me.</i>

33:58.347 --> 34:01.216
<i>I just need to escape</i>
<i>and find a path to my own life.</i>

34:02.057 --> 34:05.059
<i>Please tell Bridgette and Marie</i>
<i>that I love them,</i>

34:05.093 --> 34:07.263
<i>that they're aays</i>
<i>in my heart.</i>

34:08.906 --> 34:11.541
<i>You too, Dad.</i>

34:11.574 --> 34:13.342
<i>All my love. Ariel.</i>

34:13.377 --> 34:16.145
I'm so, so sorry, Joe!

34:16.179 --> 34:18.246
This is so hard
letting her go.

34:18.282 --> 34:21.384
I-I didn't mean it
to end this way.

34:21.418 --> 34:24.754
Dad, you think
she's ever coming back?

34:24.788 --> 34:26.688
I don't know,
girls.

34:27.658 --> 34:30.560
I-I-I-I just
don't know.

34:30.594 --> 34:33.329
Yes, yes, of course
she's coming back!

34:33.364 --> 34:34.597
I'm gonna find her.

34:34.630 --> 34:35.864
I'm gonna bring
her back.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.166
I'm gonna undo this.

34:37.201 --> 34:39.936
I will!
I will find her!

34:39.969 --> 34:41.571
You'll see!

34:43.574 --> 34:45.074
I will find her!

34:45.109 --> 34:47.476
♪ Trampin' ♪

34:47.511 --> 34:54.083
♪ Try'n-a make heaven my home. ♪

34:56.587 --> 34:57.887
Who are you
looking for?

34:57.921 --> 34:58.888
Oh!

34:58.922 --> 35:00.556
Your detective friend?

35:00.591 --> 35:03.259
Mary-Louise, I thought
you moved on a while ago.

35:03.293 --> 35:06.496
Nope. Just been
keeping out of the way,

35:06.530 --> 35:08.097
enjoying the show.

35:08.132 --> 35:10.366
Wow, that new DA?

35:10.401 --> 35:12.201
She's changed everything:

35:12.236 --> 35:14.237
reorganized
the police department,

35:14.271 --> 35:17.306
moved your buddy back
to traffic detail.

35:17.341 --> 35:20.209
Guess he won't be able
to help you find your daughter,

35:20.244 --> 35:21.511
which is just as well.

35:21.545 --> 35:23.479
She really doesn't want
to be found.

35:23.514 --> 35:25.314
You know about all that?

35:25.349 --> 35:26.449
Of course.

35:26.483 --> 35:29.318
I had to keep my eye
on the two of you.

35:29.353 --> 35:33.056
You really were the only ones
who could upset my plan.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.357
What plan?

35:43.300 --> 35:45.701
So, wait a second.

35:45.736 --> 35:47.437
So you weren't mistaken
when you told me

35:47.471 --> 35:48.704
that Clarence Denton
killed you?

35:48.739 --> 35:51.140
You knew
it was your stepson all along?

35:51.175 --> 35:53.643
Of course I knew all along.

35:53.677 --> 35:57.447
No girls found
in the last 24 hours

35:57.481 --> 36:01.918
hanging by a leather belt
from a showerhead, by the way.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.821
I do believe
the worst is over.

36:04.855 --> 36:06.889
Why would you do that?

36:06.924 --> 36:08.758
Why would you lie to me?

36:08.792 --> 36:12.161
Why would you help your stepson
get away with killing you?

36:16.934 --> 36:20.336
I loved him, Allison.

36:20.370 --> 36:22.505
Still do.

36:22.539 --> 36:24.507
From the moment
he slipped that belt

36:24.541 --> 36:27.110
around my neck,
I knew who it was.

36:27.144 --> 36:29.312
The second I died,
I started looking for someone

36:29.346 --> 36:31.414
to frame for my murder.

36:31.448 --> 36:34.617
I saw Denton kidnap
and kill that girl,

36:34.651 --> 36:36.486
and I knew I had my answer.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.754
Once I pointed you
in his direction,

36:38.789 --> 36:41.591
it was only a matter of time
till they caught him.

36:41.625 --> 36:44.827
Naturally, the DA
offered him a deal

36:44.862 --> 36:46.562
for confessing
to my murder

36:46.597 --> 36:48.531
And, of course, he confessed.

36:48.565 --> 36:52.235
He had nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

36:52.269 --> 36:54.704
Mary-Louise...

36:54.738 --> 36:56.205
that makes no sense.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.573
Ryan killed you.

36:57.608 --> 36:59.008
Now he's killing other women.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.277
No, they are not the same thing.

37:01.311 --> 37:03.813
My death was
an unfortunate accident.

37:03.847 --> 37:07.717
My death was the very definition
of an act of passion!

37:07.751 --> 37:10.019
Those other deaths...

37:10.053 --> 37:13.723
these other deaths...
it's not as if anyone

37:13.757 --> 37:15.558
is actually gonna
miss the victims.

37:15.592 --> 37:17.927
A few pieces of bar trash
losing their lives

37:17.961 --> 37:20.263
is hardly the end
of the world.

37:20.297 --> 37:22.165
What is important is
that the killing stop.

37:22.199 --> 37:24.400
And it has.
He's done.

37:24.434 --> 37:25.434
I know this.

37:25.469 --> 37:27.403
You have my word on it.

37:27.437 --> 37:28.738
Your word?

37:30.140 --> 37:33.075
What choice did I have?

37:33.110 --> 37:35.478
You made a fool out of me!

37:35.512 --> 37:38.481
I bullied my daughter
into helping solve your murder,

37:38.515 --> 37:40.616
when you knew who the killer was
all the time.

37:40.651 --> 37:42.552
And now she's gone!

37:42.586 --> 37:44.720
Well, that's not my fault.

37:44.755 --> 37:47.323
But I'd be happy
to help you find her.

37:47.357 --> 37:49.225
Not if hell froze over!

37:52.229 --> 37:54.830
The world is
a very big place, Allison.

37:54.865 --> 37:57.333
And while it's true
we can see everything,

37:57.367 --> 38:00.203
we can't see it
all at once.

38:01.305 --> 38:04.941
You know, two spirits
are better than one...

38:04.975 --> 38:07.076
although actually,
it doesn't really matter.

38:07.110 --> 38:08.177
Your daughter's gone.

38:08.212 --> 38:09.912
You're never gonna
see her again.

38:09.947 --> 38:11.847
Not now, not ever.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.202
Hey...

38:34.771 --> 38:36.105
Did you feel that?

38:36.139 --> 38:38.774
Of course I felt that.

38:38.809 --> 38:41.310
Why wouldn't I feel that?

38:42.512 --> 38:43.879
Can you hear me?

38:43.914 --> 38:45.248
Why do you do this?

38:46.283 --> 38:48.184
Why do you torture me?

38:52.089 --> 38:53.556
Mm...

38:55.259 --> 38:56.726
Okay.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.594
Now what was that for?

38:58.629 --> 39:01.797
Because you make me
feel alive!

39:02.733 --> 39:04.967
Hey, it's just part
of the service.

39:18.849 --> 39:20.650
Mom...?

39:20.684 --> 39:22.451
Hi.

39:22.486 --> 39:25.688
What are you doing
on the floor?

39:25.722 --> 39:28.891
Just getting ready.

39:28.925 --> 39:30.259
For what?

39:30.294 --> 39:32.895
For when you go.

39:32.929 --> 39:35.364
To Dartmouth?

39:35.399 --> 39:38.134
But I haven't even left yet.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.369
That's okay.

39:42.339 --> 39:45.541
You know, I'm probably
going to call you every day.

39:45.575 --> 39:47.643
You'd better.

39:47.678 --> 39:50.079
And text.

39:50.113 --> 39:52.381
Texting is good.

39:52.416 --> 39:53.883
And e-mail.

39:53.917 --> 39:57.420
Yeah. Me, too.

39:57.454 --> 39:59.522
And pictures.

39:59.556 --> 40:02.124
I'll send you lots of pictures.

40:02.159 --> 40:05.328
And you know I'm gonna
want to come visit.

40:05.395 --> 40:10.099
Sleep in your dorm room
in a sleeping bag

40:10.133 --> 40:11.233
right next to your bed.

40:11.268 --> 40:14.637
So, you want me
to get you a sleeping bag?

40:16.506 --> 40:19.575
That's okay.

40:19.609 --> 40:21.177
I'm just practicing.

40:21.211 --> 40:23.312
Yeah.

40:26.516 --> 40:28.417
I love you, Mom.

40:34.291 --> 40:35.758
Ah...

40:35.792 --> 40:37.059
10:15.

40:37.094 --> 40:38.494
Just in time for lunch.

40:38.528 --> 40:42.164
Sorry. I had an important
doctor's appointment.

40:42.199 --> 40:43.899
God, it's good to see you.

40:43.934 --> 40:44.900
It's okay.

40:44.968 --> 40:47.002
You can come in anytime
you like.

41:04.521 --> 41:06.489
Listen, I can't do this here.

41:06.523 --> 41:09.158
People can't hear you talk,
but they can hear me.

41:09.192 --> 41:10.793
Oh, my God.

41:10.827 --> 41:11.927
You actually <i>can</i> see me.

41:11.962 --> 41:14.430
Follow me.

41:17.134 --> 41:19.001
That's pretty amazing.

41:19.035 --> 41:21.270
I mean, I heard that you can
see people like me,

41:21.304 --> 41:24.006
but still, it's...
it's hard to believe.

41:26.042 --> 41:28.077
My name is Mary-Louise Graff,

41:28.111 --> 41:29.478
and I need your help.

41:29.513 --> 41:31.080
A few days ago,
I was murdered

41:31.114 --> 41:33.282
by a man named
Clarence Denton...

41:33.316 --> 41:34.316
Hold it, hold
it, hold it.

41:34.351 --> 41:35.751
Mary-Louise,
do you want me

41:35.786 --> 41:37.119
to call the police?

41:37.154 --> 41:39.422
About my murder, and the fact
that he's kidnapped...

41:39.456 --> 41:41.157
Kidnapped a young girl
named Shannon Mitchell,

41:41.191 --> 41:42.658
and he's keeping her
in his trailer.

41:42.692 --> 41:44.093
Yeah, yeah, I know
about that.

41:44.127 --> 41:46.829
Oh, and I know about
your stepson.

41:46.863 --> 41:49.331
I made a little call
on my way to work.

41:49.366 --> 41:50.866
In fact, you know,

41:50.901 --> 41:54.470
the police should probably be
picking him up right about now.

41:54.504 --> 41:55.738
So, see?

41:55.772 --> 41:58.641
You don't have any unfinished
business to worry about.

41:58.675 --> 42:01.243
You should leave you free
to go wherever it is

42:01.278 --> 42:02.611
you're meant to go.

42:04.581 --> 42:08.451
Oh, Mary-Louise, I do hope
you packed for the heat.
