She was totally affected.

Only a couple of things are different.

of the lamp post is a half an inch thick.

But that's as much as I could find.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.167
What? Why?

10:50.360 --> 10:52.203
- Because I showed up.
-Yeah.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.164
Yes. The only problem
with Barry's little theory

10:54.360 --> 10:56.249
is there were no fingerprints
found on the post.

10:56.480 --> 10:57.925
Again, Julian, not my theory.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.764
And the meta could have been
wearing gloves.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.081
Yes, perhaps.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.730
But the curvature on the post suggests

11:02.920 --> 11:04.046
that equal amounts of pressure

11:04.240 --> 11:07.403
were applied to the whole thing
at the same time.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.247
So, unless our strong man
has a wingspan of over 20 feet...

11:11.440 --> 11:12.601
Something else caused it.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.081
Yes.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.170
Who's that, sir?

11:18.440 --> 11:21.762
That's Frankie Kane,
the victim's foster kid.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.567
That poor girl's been
in and out of homes for years.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.410
Listen, she said that
she blacked out during the incident.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.125
-"Blacked out?"
-Yeah.

11:31.280 --> 11:35.729
Repressing memories is a coping mechanism
for lots of foster kids.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.964
- Hmm? Is it?
-it is.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.441
Could be something else.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.409
BOTH: What are you--

11:43.960 --> 11:45.883
- Hello, there.
-Hi.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.725
You Okay?

11:48.120 --> 11:49.281
Yeah.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.131
Can I get you some more water?

11:52.240 --> 11:53.446
Yes, thank you.

11:54.560 --> 11:55.641
Sure.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.644
Gonna need another glass, detective.
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:01.480 --> 12:02.641
- Follow him.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.649
- See what you can get.
-What are you gonna do?

12:04.800 --> 12:06.040
I'm gonna finish this up

12:06.280 --> 12:08.328
and convince my son that
he's not meant to be a superhero.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.891
Good idea.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.971
(PANTING) So, how'd <i>I</i> do?

12:18.240 --> 12:20.641
Blood pressure, heart rate,
metabolic rate, all excellent,

12:20.840 --> 12:23.127
-and you've got some serious speed, girl.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.441
I think you're good to go.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.681
(STAMMERS)
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.251
I just still want to run a few more tests.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.002
- Like what?
-Like more tests.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.845
- Uh, hey so, is Wally here?
-No, not yet.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.011
Right. Mmm.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.081
Okay, I'm gonna go grab some food.
I'm starving.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.085
Yeah. There's some power-bars
in the workshop. Help yourself.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.526
Cool.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.771
- Harry?
-Mmm-hmm.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.601
- What are you doing?
-Being thorough.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.370
Yeah? 'Cause it seems like
you're stalling.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.762
Okay, fine. I'm stalling, I'm stalling.
So what?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.007
So what, so why?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.680
"So why?" Why?
Why, I gotta explain myself to you two?

12:57.880 --> 12:59.370
Oh, I guess I do
'cause you're not parents.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.046
That's my daughter, okay?

13:02.320 --> 13:04.607
And she spent months on this very Earth,

13:04.840 --> 13:08.003
watching Barry Allen defeat meta
after meta after meta, and Zoom.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.201
Then all of a sudden, barn!

13:09.440 --> 13:12.205
She's got speed and now
she wants to be a hero just like him.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.882
And I think that's a great idea...
Not. (SIGHS)

13:16.160 --> 13:18.049
Harry, we can help her.
We can train herjust like we did

13:18.200 --> 13:19.565
-with Barry.
-I don't want you to train her.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.047
Okay? I brought her here
for you to talk her out of it.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.566
Not talk her into it.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.206
All right, Ramon?
You should talk to her. You're a meta.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.368
Yeah. Which makes me the last person

13:28.560 --> 13:30.244
she should talk to about
not using her powers.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.205
Okay, Snow, Caitlin...

13:34.560 --> 13:37.086
You and her, you've always had
such a special relationship.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.281
You talk to her.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.206
- No, we don't.
-Yeah.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.765
And I don't know anything
about having powers,

13:42.040 --> 13:45.089
so I'm the last person you should talk to
so don't ask me.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.288
But... (STAMMERING)

13:51.400 --> 13:52.606
WALLYI Dad.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.205
What's going on? Why'd you want to see me?

13:55.400 --> 13:56.606
Oh, hey.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.121
Uh, have a seat.

14:03.800 --> 14:08.328
Look, I know
it's been really hard for you.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.606
Seeing Jesse with speed and...

14:13.280 --> 14:15.931
I just keep thinking of what Harry said.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.007
How sometimes it takes a while
for powers to manifest.

14:20.640 --> 14:23.120
Yeah. Harry also said
that they may never manifest.

14:23.800 --> 14:27.600
Yes. But I got hit by that
dark matter, too, just like Jesse.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.804
It could still happen for me somehow.

14:30.640 --> 14:36.124
Look, you weren't here when
the first particle accelerator exploded.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.603
That dark matter went
throughout the whole city.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.961
Everybody got hit.

14:41.160 --> 14:44.642
Me, your sister, this whole precinct.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.846
Do you know how many metas
there have been so far?

14:48.440 --> 14:50.124
I know you want this more than anything.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.290
But you have to face the fact
that it might not happen.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.642
So you think just let it go?

14:57.320 --> 14:59.288
Give up on wanting to help people?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.643
You don't need powers to do that.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.805
Look, Barry was coming to the rescue
as a CSI long before he was the Flash.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.446
He wanted to help people then
just like you want to help people now.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.971
<i>So he studied,</i>

15:11.360 --> 15:13.328
he honed that brilliant mind of his.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.289
<i>And you have the same
brilliant mind, Wall.</i>

15:15.480 --> 15:16.686
- Dad--
-No, I mean it, son.

15:16.880 --> 15:20.168
Look, a lot of people dream about
making the world a better place.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.209
With that mind of yours
and that engineering talent,

15:24.480 --> 15:27.211
you literally could build a better world.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.170
So what? I gotta stay in school?

15:33.360 --> 15:34.850
Yeah, you gotta stay in school.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.202
Just a couple more years.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.201
What are you doing?

15:43.480 --> 15:46.324
I assumed you'd taken
a DNA sample before.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.487
Okay. Yes, I know what you're doing.
I mean, why are you doing it?

15:50.720 --> 15:52.484
What, you're looking
to steal another sample?

15:53.520 --> 15:57.570
I've isolated an element consistent
in all five of the husks that we've found.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.882
Including Edward Clariss'.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.521
You mean the Rival?

16:01.720 --> 16:03.210
Mmm-hmm, that's what the papers
are calling him, yes.

16:04.720 --> 16:05.767
What's the element?

16:06.040 --> 16:07.041
I don't know.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.722
But it's not one
that I've found in any other

16:10.000 --> 16:12.571
meta-human samples that I've studied.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.566
So you think that Frankie,
the girl downstairs,

16:15.760 --> 16:17.603
has the same element in her DNA?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.764
Well, I wouldn't be comparing samples

16:20.040 --> 16:22.247
if it wasn't a possibility,
would I, Allen?

16:24.720 --> 16:26.927
It's a good thing for both of us I did.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.241
- What?
-Come on.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.680
What?

16:31.560 --> 16:33.528
- BARRY: Calm down, okay?
-Where is she?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.922
- Julian--
-You, you girl, stop!

16:36.240 --> 16:37.241
- Hey, ease up, Julian.
-Stop!

16:37.400 --> 16:38.925
- You did it, didn't you?
-Me? What?

16:39.080 --> 16:40.411
The lamp post. You did it, didn't you?

16:40.640 --> 16:41.766
What? No, no, no, stop!

16:41.960 --> 16:43.041
- You're a liar.
-JuHan!

16:43.240 --> 16:45.083
- You're a meta-human.
-Stop, no. Stop! (GROANING)

16:45.280 --> 16:47.442
You put your foster father
in the hospital, didn't you?

16:47.720 --> 16:49.802
- No,no.No.
-Didn't you?

16:50.320 --> 16:51.731
Didn't you?

16:54.920 --> 16:56.968
Oh, I wanted to do more than hurt him.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.811
(EXHALES)
And, now, I'm gonna do the same to you.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.089
(METAL CLANGING)

17:05.440 --> 17:06.601
(GLASS SHATTERING)

17:15.599 --> 17:17.967
Frankie! Frankie, stop!

17:18.280 --> 17:20.123
(PANTING)

17:29.440 --> 17:30.646
You Okay?

17:38.080 --> 17:39.127
Frankie!

17:39.320 --> 17:41.004
No. Frankie's gone.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.005
My name is Magenta.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.651
You're like this because of Alchemy.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.162
<i>He changed you, didn't he?</i>

17:48.480 --> 17:49.811
<i>This isn't you.</i>

17:50.040 --> 17:51.530
Just come with me.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.840
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

17:55.480 --> 17:56.641
I can help you.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.724
I don't need any more help, Flash.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.005
I just don't want anyone to get hurt.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.891
It's too late for that.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.121
(GRUNTS)

18:08.840 --> 18:09.887
Frankie, don't!

18:10.520 --> 18:12.841
It's me or him!

18:13.680 --> 18:14.841
Come on.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.207
(GRUNTS)

18:21.040 --> 18:22.041
(GLASS SHATTERING)

18:23.640 --> 18:24.846
(PANTING)

18:28.040 --> 18:31.681
Her name's Frankie Kane.
But she's calling herself Magenta.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.049
- Meh.
-And Magenta is a whole different person

18:35.200 --> 18:38.044
than the scared, kind girl
I was interviewing.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.210
- She's dissociative.
-You mean split-personality.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.521
According to her medical records,

18:42.760 --> 18:44.728
it's a condition she's been dealing with
her entire life.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.730
I'm sure all the yelling at C.C.P.D.
is what triggered it.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.882
So Frankie is Jekyll, Magenta is Hyde.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.081
Classic, good versus evil.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.210
- Or she's pulling a Primal Fear.
-She's faking it.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.686
No, she's not faking it.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.885
I saw the struggle going on inside of her.
Magenta's trying to take over completely.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.520
You said she was raised
in the foster care system?

19:02.720 --> 19:05.200
Yep. All her life.
She went from home to home.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.244
Yeah, and maybe not good ones.
Her current foster father, John,

19:08.520 --> 19:10.090
the one who was hurt in the attack?

19:10.240 --> 19:12.129
Yeah, he's got a few disorderly conducts.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.927
He might have some information we can use.
I can follow up with him.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.248
Mmm-hmm. There is something else.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.569
She got her powers from Alchemy.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.530
When I said his name, she knew who he was.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.650
So Magenta must have existed
in the other timeline, too.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.245
- Who's Alchemy?
-(SCOFFS)

19:26.760 --> 19:30.367
Well, uh, Doctor Alchemy
is a magic man in a cloak

19:30.600 --> 19:34.047
who can somehow restore the powers
that people had in Flashpoint.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.961
Okay, and what's Flashpoint?

19:37.480 --> 19:39.767
That's what we're calling the alternate
timeline that Barry created

19:39.960 --> 19:41.928
when he went back in time
and saved his mom.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.964
Oh, so Magenta is another
side effect from your time trip.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.083
Genius... Not.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.442
Um, I don't need to be reminded.
Thank you.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.769
Look, anybody with those powers
and as angry as her

19:54.080 --> 19:56.321
needs to be tracked down, fast.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.331
Well, great. I mean, fast I can do.
Let me just go carb-load.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.121
He didn't-- That's-- You don't--

20:04.960 --> 20:06.166
Snow.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.651
Please.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.725
Okay, Harry. I'll talk to her.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.645
But I don't know what I'm gonna say.

20:16.280 --> 20:20.729
Hey, Joe, did you talk to Wally?
He still seems a little bummed.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.804
It's not gonna fix itself overnight,
but it's all good. He gets it.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.365
- Okay.
-And I gotta be honest,

20:25.560 --> 20:27.642
it was one of my better
"Dad-Cop" speeches.

20:27.840 --> 20:28.966
What's "Dad-Cop?"

20:29.160 --> 20:31.891
There's good cop, bad cop, and "Dad-Cop."

20:32.160 --> 20:34.162
Firm but reassuring. Cuts to the point.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.487
I don't think I know that one.

20:35.680 --> 20:36.647
Yeah, I didn't use it on you.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.009
Wally's different than you, Barry.
You're like a second daughter.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.651
You overshare your feelings.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.161
Him I gotta be a little bit more nuanced.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.323
Huh? Cool.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.925
- I'm messing with you.
-(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

20:48.160 --> 20:49.924
I'll talk at you if I get
any leads on Frankie, all right?

20:50.160 --> 20:51.525
All right.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.322
Second daughter, what is he talking about?

20:55.760 --> 20:57.762
CAITLIN: Hey, hey.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.885
Hey, sorry, um...

21:00.240 --> 21:02.925
You guys were not kidding when you
said speedsters were hungry all the time.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.286
Yeah.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.207
Listen, Jesse,
before you speed off to find Frankie,

21:08.360 --> 21:11.842
I just wanna make sure
that you feel like you're ready?

Barry didn't have to take things slow.

the second he got his powers.

"I'd return to you the power you had
to inflict your pain upon others."

23:19.880 --> 23:21.405
I came to you,

No, no. This is all me.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.200
You all right?

24:08.040 --> 24:11.408
Uh, you know, when this whole thing
happened to me, you were...

24:11.880 --> 24:14.724
You were actually the first person
I wanted to call.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.887

it happened to you, too.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.042

24:27.880 --> 24:29.564
I mean, it was... It was crazy.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.724
So like, one day,
I was walking home from a friend's house,

24:32.920 --> 24:35.651
and this car, it ran a red light,

24:35.880 --> 24:38.770
and, you know,
it was speeding right at me.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.086
And I just stood there, frozen.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.884
You know, basically waiting to be hit.

24:42.240 --> 24:45.562
And then I looked around,
and everything around me was frozen, too.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.651
And it was peaceful and quiet,

24:49.080 --> 24:51.765
but I felt this, like,
electricity running in me.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.006
And, so, I ran out of the way.

24:55.240 --> 24:59.928
Like, I kept running and running
and I mean, now I don't ever want to stop.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.969
So you basically
just jumpstarted your powers.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.443

33:39.440 --> 33:41.283
I'm so sorry.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.130
It's gonna be okay.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.123
It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.803
So no one else got hurt?

33:59.040 --> 34:01.646
Luckily, no.
You don't have to worry about that.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.441
What about John?

34:03.680 --> 34:05.967
<i>JOE: The DA is prosecuting him
for what he did to you.</i>

34:06.280 --> 34:07.850
So I think he's gonna be serving time,

34:08.120 --> 34:11.647
and he's not gonna ever be
anybody's foster father again.

34:12.719 --> 34:18.170
It's just so strange being responsible
for all of this

34:18.320 --> 34:20.163
and not remember any of it.

34:20.360 --> 34:21.725
What do you remember?

34:21.960 --> 34:25.567
About how you got your powers?
How this all began?

34:26.520 --> 34:28.248
(SIGHS) Um...

34:29.360 --> 34:33.159
I started having dreams
at night of Magenta.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.641
Dreams?

34:34.840 --> 34:36.489
<i>Well, they were more than dreams.</i>

34:37.040 --> 34:40.487
I don't know, it was like
I was living another life or something.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.686
And then I started getting them
all the time, during the day...

34:45.520 --> 34:47.920
And the more it happened,

34:48.320 --> 34:51.210
the more painful they became.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.525
<i>Then I started hearing a voice.</i>

34:54.159 --> 34:55.161
What voice?

34:55.760 --> 34:58.525
It was a man named Alchemy.

34:59.360 --> 35:03.684
<i>He said he could give me what I wanted
and make me powerful again.</i>

35:04.200 --> 35:07.568
But I didn't understand,
I thought I was going crazy.

35:08.520 --> 35:12.286
Trust me, Magenta is not here
because of anything that you did.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.569
There may be a darkness inside of you,
but if you face it,

35:15.800 --> 35:18.201
it'll make it easier
for the good side of you to win.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.211
You're letting me go?

35:20.520 --> 35:22.727
None of this is your fault, Frankie.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.361

35:25.720 --> 35:27.722

But what if Magenta tries to come back?

35:31.080 --> 35:32.411
Fight her.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.566
<i>And if you need help, we'll be there.</i>

You sure?

Yeah.

You really were.

do it 'cause you believed in me. So...

36:42.600 --> 36:43.601
Uh-uh.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.725
I should have been that way
a long, long time ago.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.650
I'm always gonna worry.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.407
I'm always going to be cautious.

I'm always going to love you.

I think we'll stay here a few more days,

So, you're ready to try this again?

why our last date was so boring.

that I shouldn't use my powers.

And it's not that
I'm nothing without them,

39:25.800 --> 39:28.007

They're a part of you.

This is our life and I think last date,
we were ignoring that part of us.

We were trying to be the people
that we were before I was the Flash.
