WEBVTT

00:19.387 --> 00:23.555
Nori, just one more time, okay?

01:48.375 --> 01:52.678
Mom, where are you going?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.313
I'll just be gone for a bit.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.704
Thanks, Nick.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.672
I'll see you soon.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.258
Excuse me.

03:46.260 --> 03:46.992
I'm Detective Murphy.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.769
Who's my first responder?

03:57.771 --> 03:59.338
Over there. That's me.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.509
Homeless guy called it in.

04:04.511 --> 04:09.548
It's, uh... I've never seen
anything like that before.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.949
When did you get here?

04:10.951 --> 04:12.384
A few minutes before midnight.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.319
Has anyone else been inside?

04:14.321 --> 04:19.658
Ju... just me and my partner
here, uh, one of the EMTs,

04:19.660 --> 04:20.759
and, uh, Lieutenant...

04:20.761 --> 04:23.895
Welcome back, Detective.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.897
Picked a hell of a night
to come back to work.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.500
Well, I hope you're
not here to babysit me.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.602
I'm not.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.571
I was halfway home
when I got the call.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.473
I was getting a lot of
chatter about this one.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.875
Oh, yeah, why's that?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.844
You should probably pop
your head in and take a look.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.058
Ah, good to see you.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.627
You, too.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.962
You ready for this?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.569
It's all you.

05:04.571 --> 05:05.604
Let me know if
you need anything.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.583
What is this?

05:50.984 --> 05:54.419
She's completely charred, and
there's no evidence of a fire.

05:54.421 --> 05:55.387
I know, exactly.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.362
The homeless guy, did he
call in a body or a fire?

06:03.364 --> 06:05.564
Nothing about a
fire, just the body.

06:19.113 --> 06:24.583
"Kyoko Oshiro," what
happened to you?

07:28.081 --> 07:29.147
Mrs. Oshiro?

07:31.652 --> 07:32.784
Hi.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.186
I'm Detective Stella Murphy.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.220
Can I come in for a minute?

07:42.796 --> 07:48.900
Okay, so she left the apartment
last night at around 9:45?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.535
And did she tell you
where she was going?

07:50.537 --> 07:51.603
Who killed her?

07:55.576 --> 07:59.077
That's what I'm going
to find out, Mrs. Oshiro.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.679
Do you know anyone
who would want

08:00.681 --> 08:03.081
to hurt Kyoko, any friends,
family, co-workers?

08:13.794 --> 08:17.596
Ma'am, I know that
this is very difficult,

08:17.598 --> 08:22.601
but would you be willing to come
down and identify Kyoko's body?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.135
I cannot.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.673
I understand.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.279
Before I go, would you mind
if I took a look around?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.086
Thank you.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.219
Yeah, hold on one sec.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.120
Yeah?

09:49.122 --> 09:50.789
Can you send IT over?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.190
I need to change my password.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.258
For what?

09:55.662 --> 09:58.997
Because it's still Mara.

09:58.999 --> 09:59.998
Yeah, I'll send someone over.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.608
So we don't have any
dental records to match to.

10:09.610 --> 10:14.279
Logic obviously points
to this being Ms. Oshiro.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.615
Yeah, I figured as much.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.350
Family is not going
to come identify.

10:18.352 --> 10:19.851
I don't blame them.

10:19.853 --> 10:25.357
This body, I ran
carbon-14 dating

10:25.359 --> 10:27.325
on her a couple of
times, even recalibrated

10:27.327 --> 10:30.929
the machine to make sure
something wasn't wrong.

10:30.931 --> 10:39.871
Each reading put this body
at more than 1,000 years old.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.874
She wasn't burnt.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.876
She's petrified.

11:31.825 --> 11:37.729
I want to see Mom.

11:37.731 --> 11:38.730
You cannot.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.265
Why not?

11:40.267 --> 11:44.235
We will hear from the police
when they find something.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.304
Don't you want to see her?

11:48.475 --> 11:50.875
We will not speak
about this anymore.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.490
Yeah?

13:12.492 --> 13:13.958
I need an APB sent out.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.527
On who?

13:15.529 --> 13:17.495
The homeless man who called
in the body, Rudolfo Sanchez,

13:17.497 --> 13:20.098
he has a prior for
arson a few years back.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.099
Call you back?

13:21.101 --> 13:22.367
Thanks.

13:22.369 --> 13:25.069
You got anything else?

13:25.071 --> 13:26.538
Is this the level of supervision

13:26.540 --> 13:27.872
I can expect from now on?

13:30.410 --> 13:32.143
I was wondering.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.145
Do you have any idea why a
woman who was born 42 years ago

13:34.147 --> 13:38.049
has been dead for 1,000 years?

13:38.051 --> 13:40.819
Anyway, that's how the,
uh, chain of command works.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.120
Right.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.254
Are you gonna have
a problem with that?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.027
No.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.028
I left.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.363
You stayed, got a promotion.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.431
I'm proud of you.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.833
Stella, Stella.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.506
Sorry.
I tried your first.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.141
She wouldn't stop
asking for you.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.142
It's okay.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.210
Thank you.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.480
Nori, is everything okay?

14:09.482 --> 14:11.015
I was wondering if
I could see my mom.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.353
Um.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.426
I'd really like to see her.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.229
Yeah, I understand.

14:24.231 --> 14:33.371
Um, honey, I don't know if
that's a good idea right now.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.608
You... you don't want
to see her like this.

14:39.613 --> 14:40.879
I need to.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.884
How old are you, again?

14:45.886 --> 14:48.019
I'm 18.

14:48.021 --> 14:52.523
Is your grandma here, Nori?
No.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.428
Let's go.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.671
This is never easy.

15:06.673 --> 15:07.939
Okay.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.147
No.

15:18.652 --> 15:19.617
So this is her.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.219
No.

17:06.159 --> 17:06.790
Can I come in?

17:06.792 --> 17:08.459
Not right now.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.528
No, ma'am, was there
something you didn't tell me?

17:15.101 --> 17:20.405
Your daughter's body was
petrified, and the tests we ran

17:20.406 --> 17:25.076
came back saying she'd been
dead nearly 1,000 years.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.477
I don't mean to overstep here.

17:26.479 --> 17:30.648
But your granddaughter,
something happened to Nori

17:30.650 --> 17:33.618
when she saw her mother's body.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.387
Now considering the two
strangest things I have ever

17:36.389 --> 17:39.390
seen in my life happened
with your family,

17:39.392 --> 17:43.161
I'm thinking you could
tell me something.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.662
You could not
possibly understand.

17:48.802 --> 17:49.700
What happened?

17:49.702 --> 17:50.735
My Kaisho.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.270
And the detective saw.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.805
I didn't mean to.

17:53.807 --> 17:57.475
Nori, these people cannot know.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.578
There's no point in it.
What?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.146
You must not be seen.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.081
You cannot...

18:06.419 --> 18:09.720
How you doing?

18:09.722 --> 18:14.692
It's a weird one, more questions

18:14.694 --> 18:16.861
than answers at this point.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.497
No, I mean, how are you?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.299
Oh, I'm fine.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.834
Just checking.

18:22.836 --> 18:26.571
I can still do that, right?

18:26.573 --> 18:31.242
Yeah, I wouldn't be here
if I wasn't all right.

18:31.244 --> 18:31.843
Have a good night.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.892
Jake.
Jake!

19:58.898 --> 20:00.464
Stella, what are you doing?

20:00.466 --> 20:03.201
I got to do my laundry.
Excuse me.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.275
You been drinking?

20:16.349 --> 20:18.282
I don't like seeing
you like this.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.751
Jake, can you just please
stop it with all this, like,

20:20.753 --> 20:22.353
supervisor...

20:22.355 --> 20:24.222
Are you kidding me right now?

20:25.357 --> 20:26.489
My wife comes to our
house that she hasn't

20:26.492 --> 20:27.825
been to in months, drunk.

20:27.827 --> 20:28.993
You think I don't have
a right to be concerned?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.228
Fine.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.262
I'm not asking you to be fine.

20:31.264 --> 20:31.996
I'm asking you to be careful.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.864
Okay.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.502
What the fuck is that?

20:38.504 --> 20:39.837
Ow.
Ow.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.677
I don't know when you got into
this rogue I can, like, suffer

20:46.679 --> 20:49.647
through this on my
own bullshit, but it

20:53.820 --> 20:55.253
doesn't have to be that way.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.687
You're not the only one in pain.

20:56.689 --> 21:01.592
Oh, that's funny, because
it didn't really seem

21:01.594 --> 21:02.793
like it bothered you that much.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.669
I'll let myself out.

21:11.671 --> 21:12.737
Yeah, why don't you
take a fucking cab?

22:09.095 --> 22:09.994
I don't want tea.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.902
Why didn't you or
Mom ever explain

22:17.904 --> 22:21.472
what was going to happen to me?

22:21.474 --> 22:26.911
A Kaisho is something you
must discover for yourself.

22:26.913 --> 22:30.681
It is our sacred
gift to bring back

22:30.683 --> 22:33.851
what is beautiful in the world.

22:33.853 --> 22:38.989
But you must not be seen until
you can learn to control it.

22:38.991 --> 22:44.562
Noriko, your mother did not want
you to grow up living in fear.

22:44.564 --> 22:50.401
So instead, we chose to
stay hidden from the world?

22:50.403 --> 22:52.069
I was so lost yesterday.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.104
You should not have gone.

22:53.106 --> 22:54.505
I needed to see her.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.578
I just want things to be normal.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.714
Do not complain
about what is normal.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.950
You are not normal.

23:05.952 --> 23:10.554
Your Kaisho is more important
than your happiness.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.690
It is your responsibility.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.549
Murphy.
Murphy.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.803
I don't think you're
ready to be back.

25:05.805 --> 25:09.273
Why, because of last night?
I'm sorry.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.241
What time is it?

25:10.243 --> 25:11.709
Am I late for work, Jake?

25:11.711 --> 25:12.977
I don't understand.
What's the problem?

25:12.979 --> 25:14.044
Oh, I don't know,
drunk driving, maybe.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.882
I'm going to recommend
you go back out on leave.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.817
Oh, okay, don't go
on a power trip.

25:19.819 --> 25:23.954
You need more time.
No, I don't need more time.

25:23.956 --> 25:26.924
What I need is to stay busy.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.837
Okay.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.138
I'm sorry.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.873
Last night was stupid,
and it was reckless.

25:42.875 --> 25:43.807
It won't happen again.

25:46.746 --> 25:47.945
But if you're really
worried about me,

25:47.947 --> 25:49.914
you'll let me do my job.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.849
I promise it's what's
best for me right now.

25:51.851 --> 25:52.883
I can bring this case home.

25:52.885 --> 25:53.784
You just need to let me.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.557
If for a second I don't
think you can handle it,

25:59.559 --> 26:00.190
I'm pulling you back off.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.094
All right.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.776
Evening, what can I get you?
Hi.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.311
I'm looking for Davis.

26:20.313 --> 26:21.845
Is he here?

26:21.847 --> 26:23.247
I'll get him.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.782
Ordering anything?

26:24.784 --> 26:26.617
Yeah, a cup of
coffee would be great.

26:26.619 --> 26:27.351
Thank you.

26:36.729 --> 26:39.630
It's clean, just
the humidity makes

26:39.632 --> 26:41.765
everything a little sticky.

26:43.069 --> 26:45.836
I didn't want you to
think things were dirty.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.005
What can I do for you, miss?

26:48.007 --> 26:49.907
I'm Detective Stella Murphy.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.109
I just have some questions
about Kyoko Oshiro.

26:56.382 --> 26:59.316
Uh.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.319
Do you want to
talk somewhere else?

27:02.321 --> 27:04.722
She asked me to do it.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.991
Excuse me?
Look.

27:06.993 --> 27:10.094
I don't want to make
this into some big deal.

27:10.096 --> 27:15.666
But, uh, I don't make
a lot of money here.

27:15.668 --> 27:18.736
I'm barely managing
to keep the lights on.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.170
With all that's
going on out there,

27:20.172 --> 27:21.972
I don't know how
you guys can come

27:21.974 --> 27:25.876
down on me for paying somebody
a few dollars under the table.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.178
Okay.

27:28.180 --> 27:33.350
So what is it, a fine?

27:33.352 --> 27:35.853
Did she report this?

27:35.855 --> 27:38.822
She hasn't even been here
for the last two shifts.

27:38.824 --> 27:42.126
Mr. Davis, I work homicide.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.028
Kyoko was found
dead four days ago.

28:03.749 --> 28:04.715
Can I help you?

30:32.131 --> 30:33.197
Mom?

31:04.630 --> 31:08.098
No, Kyoko had a
child and responsibility.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.633
She was taking
care of her mother.

31:09.635 --> 31:13.637
There's no world in which
she would do this to herself.

31:13.639 --> 31:16.607
Because it's not.

31:16.609 --> 31:18.275
Jake, she never
even went to school.

31:18.277 --> 31:22.045
Nobody knows anything about her.

31:22.047 --> 31:26.350
I don't know, but it
seems like Kyoko was

31:26.352 --> 31:29.152
just keeping her hidden inside.

31:32.024 --> 31:39.429
Or maybe she was... she was
trying to keep something out.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.364
I don't know.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.405
Hello.
Wait.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.973
What?

32:54.206 --> 32:57.174
What is this?

32:57.176 --> 32:59.142
I think this is
who killed my mom.

33:26.171 --> 33:29.339
It happened in my mom's room.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.376
It was something in this book.

33:32.378 --> 33:36.413
I thought that maybe I could do
it again to see who killed her.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.783
Have you ever done anything
like that before or seen it?

33:39.785 --> 33:41.051
No.

33:43.555 --> 33:47.190
But I've grown up
learning about my family,

33:47.192 --> 33:51.395
that we're connected
to something very old.

33:51.397 --> 33:56.066
There used to be more like us,
but people are afraid of what

33:56.068 --> 33:57.034
they don't understand.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.309
I used to feel so
safe around her.

34:06.311 --> 34:09.713
Now it's as if I'm in
this giant sea and...

34:09.715 --> 34:11.214
It just seems endless?

34:14.786 --> 34:16.053
Yes.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.431
I know that man.

34:27.433 --> 34:30.400
Mr. Davis has always
been very nice to us.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.837
Anytime I was sick, he would
bring over soup to our home.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.304
She said she really
liked working here.

34:38.177 --> 34:41.143
Do you like your job?

34:41.146 --> 34:44.181
Uh, yeah.

34:44.183 --> 34:48.150
Yeah, it's not easy,
but, yeah, I like it.

34:48.152 --> 34:52.522
Might not be the best way
to look at it, but sometimes

34:52.524 --> 34:55.559
when you see how bad
it can be for people

34:55.561 --> 35:00.597
it forces you to evolve
in more ways than one.

35:00.599 --> 35:04.401
That's good, right?
Yeah.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.273
Whether or not you're
growing closer or farther

35:10.275 --> 35:13.143
from the things in your
life, it's just important

35:13.145 --> 35:14.344
that you're growing, right?

35:21.553 --> 35:22.886
Have a good night, okay?

35:22.888 --> 35:24.821
You, too.
Bye.

35:54.153 --> 35:58.321
Shh, shh.

36:05.264 --> 36:06.663
Yeah, this is Detective
Stella Murphy.

36:06.665 --> 36:07.631
I need all available units.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.178
She have someplace to go?

36:21.180 --> 36:23.780
Uh, yeah, we're working
on that right now.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.248
Well, I think it's safe to say

36:25.250 --> 36:28.852
the killer knows the family.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.387
What?

36:30.389 --> 36:33.290
The entire
apartment was trashed,

36:33.292 --> 36:35.192
but Nori's room was untouched.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.574
Hey, let's get you
out of here, okay?

36:50.576 --> 36:51.942
I'll call you later.

36:59.952 --> 37:01.518
Can I stay with you tonight?

37:32.451 --> 37:33.416
Come on in.

37:37.889 --> 37:43.994
So I can get you some
sheets for the couch.

37:56.375 --> 38:00.310
Okay, so here are
some, uh, blankets.

38:00.312 --> 38:04.281
Is a t-shirt okay?

38:04.283 --> 38:08.718
Um, you can turn on
the TV if you want.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.420
I don't have cable, but...

38:13.292 --> 38:16.826
Also I usually keep some
music on while I sleep.

38:16.828 --> 38:17.894
Is that okay?

38:20.799 --> 38:21.865
Um.

39:25.397 --> 39:28.365
Do you want one?

39:28.367 --> 39:29.366
Does it hurt?

39:29.368 --> 39:30.133
Yeah, a little.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.907
I used to have this
townhouse with my ex.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.409
Ex?

39:39.411 --> 39:42.412
Ex-husband,
I used to be married.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.446
Oh.

39:43.448 --> 39:44.914
Yeah, we had this place.

39:44.916 --> 39:48.718
It wasn't anything fancy,
but it was our dream home.

39:51.857 --> 39:56.159
Anyway, one night, I was lying
in bed, and all of a sudden I

39:56.161 --> 39:58.928
heard this dripping sound.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.564
I was just lying
there, listening to it,

40:01.566 --> 40:04.768
waiting for it to go away
or waiting until I stopped

40:04.770 --> 40:06.569
caring about it or something.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.772
But neither happened,
so I got up.

40:08.774 --> 40:12.809
And I... I went to
go look for it,

40:12.811 --> 40:17.080
just searching around
for this dripping sound.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.782
And all the faucets
were turned off,

40:18.784 --> 40:20.984
and the windows were closed.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.420
I'm just looking for
this little, like, drip,

40:23.422 --> 40:27.757
drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.427
So finally, I... I went
out into the hallway.

40:30.429 --> 40:35.465
And I could hear that it was
coming from inside the wall.

40:35.467 --> 40:39.035
There was really nothing I
could do, short of putting

40:39.037 --> 40:40.170
a hammer through the wall.

40:40.172 --> 40:41.905
So I just went back to bed.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.907
And I tried to go to
sleep, but I couldn't.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.179
And then it happened again the
next night, and the next night,

40:49.181 --> 40:50.780
and the next night.

40:50.782 --> 40:55.919
So I got one of those
little, uh, music players.

40:55.921 --> 41:00.457
And I, um, I would
play my favorite jazz

41:00.459 --> 41:04.861
albums so I could sleep.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.963
The first night, I could
still kind of hear the drip,

41:06.965 --> 41:10.633
but then it just
kind of went away.

41:16.107 --> 41:24.180
You know, sometimes noise is so
loud that you just have to make

41:30.055 --> 41:31.488
your own to cover it up.

41:39.731 --> 41:42.966
The radiators in our house
used to make a loud banging.

41:42.968 --> 41:44.033
Yeah?

41:46.571 --> 41:47.637
We got them fixed.

42:10.128 --> 42:11.027
I brought you some coffee.

42:11.029 --> 42:15.732
I'm not supposed to.

42:15.734 --> 42:16.966
Okay.

42:16.968 --> 42:21.104
I'll just leave it
here if you want it.

42:21.106 --> 42:25.008
So we have somewhere we
need to be this morning.

42:25.010 --> 42:27.210
Why don't you hop in the shower?

42:27.212 --> 42:30.780
I left a towel and
some clothes for you.

42:30.782 --> 42:31.848
Okay.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.348
Okay, just sign right there.

43:10.155 --> 43:12.589
I'll make sure your grandma
is right next to her, okay?

43:18.997 --> 43:19.963
Thank you.

43:57.736 --> 44:00.269
Hey.

44:00.271 --> 44:02.839
Hey!
Hey!

44:19.824 --> 44:21.958
It's a sports bike, no plates.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.827
Rider is in all black gear.

44:24.829 --> 44:29.032
I think male, but
don't hold me to that.

44:29.034 --> 44:31.367
Okay, yeah, let me know.

44:31.369 --> 44:33.236
What did they say?

44:33.238 --> 44:36.072
Well, it's not much,
but it's out to dispatch.

44:36.074 --> 44:38.141
It's not much to go
on, but you never know.

44:40.912 --> 44:42.345
He's coming for me.

44:42.347 --> 44:44.447
Hey, I'm not going to
let anything happen to you.

44:44.449 --> 44:45.715
Yeah.

44:51.823 --> 44:53.790
Being a detective just
seems like asking a lot

44:53.792 --> 44:55.324
of people a lot of questions.

44:56.895 --> 44:59.328
You're not wrong about
that, but you also need

44:59.330 --> 45:02.265
to know how to read people.

45:02.267 --> 45:04.367
It's not about their answers.

45:04.369 --> 45:05.401
It's about how they answer.

45:09.808 --> 45:11.708
Mr. Davis.

45:11.710 --> 45:14.277
Ladies, any news?

45:14.279 --> 45:15.978
Has a man in a motorcycle outfit

45:15.980 --> 45:19.449
ever come in here to
talk to my mother?

45:19.451 --> 45:21.050
Yeah.

45:21.052 --> 45:23.453
Yeah, last week, she had
an argument with some guy.

45:23.455 --> 45:24.854
He came in.

45:24.856 --> 45:26.856
He was decked out
from head to toe.

45:26.858 --> 45:29.258
What?
What were they arguing about?

45:29.260 --> 45:32.495
I don't speak Japanese.
Well, what?

45:32.497 --> 45:35.064
I... I thought he was a
customer, someone she knew.

45:35.066 --> 45:35.832
I don't know.

45:35.834 --> 45:37.366
I asked you.

45:37.368 --> 45:39.102
And I just remembered it.

45:43.842 --> 45:44.907
Do those work?

45:53.818 --> 45:55.284
Do you recognize him?

45:55.286 --> 45:57.787
No, just from today.
Are you sure?

45:57.789 --> 46:02.525
Murph, my office, now.

46:02.527 --> 46:05.128
I'll be back.

46:15.073 --> 46:16.472
What the hell is she doing here?

46:16.474 --> 46:18.407
Jake, she's an active
part of my investigation.

46:18.409 --> 46:20.143
Okay, a civilian,
nonetheless a kid,

46:20.145 --> 46:21.878
cannot be in the pen, pretending
to play junior detective.

46:21.880 --> 46:25.348
I'm getting an idea on
some security footage.

46:25.350 --> 46:27.216
Her entire family is dead.

46:27.218 --> 46:28.818
We buried her mom this morning.

46:28.820 --> 46:30.353
And in the process, we
found a possible suspect.

46:30.355 --> 46:31.954
An arsonist.
This is not arson.

46:35.126 --> 46:41.497
We can agree something crazy
is going on here, right?

46:41.499 --> 46:44.267
We have run out of
words to describe

46:44.269 --> 46:45.868
the state of these
bodies, let alone

46:45.870 --> 46:47.136
how the killings
actually went down.

46:47.138 --> 46:50.573
And that little girl
is at the center of it.

46:50.575 --> 46:54.177
I know what this sounds
like, but she is special.

46:54.179 --> 46:55.444
What do you expect
me to do with that?

46:55.446 --> 46:57.046
I expect you to believe me.

46:57.048 --> 46:58.347
All right, well, special
isn't going to cut it.

46:58.349 --> 46:59.882
Especially since the
second body showed up,

46:59.884 --> 47:01.284
we're getting a lot of
pressure from upstairs.

47:01.286 --> 47:04.320
Oh, well, I'm sorry
you're having a tough time.

47:04.322 --> 47:08.424
If you want to be helpful
to me, call immigration.

47:08.426 --> 47:09.892
Check on the Oshiro family.

47:28.980 --> 47:31.113
Murphy.
Hmm?

47:50.468 --> 47:51.434
Stay close.

48:23.368 --> 48:25.368
Hey, are you okay?

48:25.370 --> 48:26.903
I'm okay.
All right.

48:30.008 --> 48:33.542
Do you mind if I lay
down for a little while?

48:33.544 --> 48:35.211
You're in the guest
bedroom upstairs.

48:35.213 --> 48:35.978
Make yourself at home.

48:48.192 --> 48:49.125
It's okay.

48:52.330 --> 48:53.396
Hey.

48:56.067 --> 48:56.632
You doing all right?

48:56.634 --> 48:58.234
Come on.

48:58.236 --> 49:00.336
You should have someone
go back to the apartment.

49:00.338 --> 49:03.239
Um, maybe he left
something behind.

49:03.241 --> 49:04.373
Maybe just do, like, a...
Yeah, I already...

49:04.375 --> 49:05.441
I called already.
Okay.

49:05.443 --> 49:06.509
It's good.

49:09.981 --> 49:11.213
How long has she been
staying with you?

49:19.123 --> 49:25.695
Two nights, ever
since her grandmother...

49:25.697 --> 49:27.229
Stella...
I know.

49:27.231 --> 49:29.098
I know.

49:33.304 --> 49:34.136
It's not a good look.

49:37.375 --> 49:38.441
Hey.

49:47.752 --> 49:49.018
It's okay.

49:55.460 --> 49:57.026
You're all right.

50:00.498 --> 50:03.032
It's just been so weird,
having a kid around.

50:07.672 --> 50:08.738
It's okay.

50:22.653 --> 50:23.719
I'm sorry.

50:38.736 --> 50:45.341
It wasn't anybody's fault.

50:45.343 --> 50:49.378
She rolled onto her
stomach in the middle

50:49.380 --> 50:52.748
of the night, which is something
she had never done before.

50:55.753 --> 51:02.191
And when she was face down, her
neck wasn't strong enough yet

51:02.193 --> 51:03.392
to turn to the side.

51:03.394 --> 51:07.463
So she... she suffocated
in her sleep.

51:12.403 --> 51:19.275
Nobody tells you how afraid you
become when you have a baby.

51:22.413 --> 51:26.115
I used to wake up at the
slightest sound coming

51:26.117 --> 51:29.852
from the monitor,
just so paranoid

51:29.854 --> 51:38.227
that every movement or cough
or moan was something bad.

51:42.867 --> 51:45.401
She was so quiet that night.

51:50.141 --> 51:54.877
I'm sorry for going in there.
It's okay.

52:07.158 --> 52:08.224
It's okay.

52:14.198 --> 52:17.466
So I'll just, um, I'll just
set up in the living room.

52:20.771 --> 52:22.571
Do you need anything?

52:22.573 --> 52:26.408
Yeah, do you still have that
speaker from the holiday party?

52:26.410 --> 52:28.844
Oh, I forgot to tell
you, I fixed the drip.

52:28.846 --> 52:32.414
It's gone.

52:32.416 --> 52:33.782
It's in the junk drawer.

53:04.448 --> 53:06.248
Yeah.

53:06.250 --> 53:06.815
All right, go ahead.

53:09.520 --> 53:10.586
Right.

53:14.492 --> 53:16.625
Immigration just called.

53:16.627 --> 53:18.527
I got some information
on the Oshiros.

53:18.529 --> 53:19.862
Yeah?

53:19.864 --> 53:24.333
Oshiro Kyoko and Umaris
Yako immigrated in 1998.

53:24.335 --> 53:26.569
Six months later,
they had Noriko.

53:26.571 --> 53:28.237
Get this.

53:28.239 --> 53:31.540
Supposedly, there's a son
in the family, Jin Oshiro,

53:31.542 --> 53:33.742
wasn't on any of the
immigration records.

53:33.744 --> 53:39.315
He was busted for assault
in '08, nothing since.

53:39.317 --> 53:40.849
You think Nori knows about him?

53:49.427 --> 53:55.431
Nori?

53:59.403 --> 54:00.369
Oh, my God.

54:53.791 --> 54:54.857
Hi.

54:57.528 --> 54:58.494
I'm Jin.

55:02.900 --> 55:03.866
You're Nori, right?

55:06.904 --> 55:09.538
Did you kill them?

55:09.540 --> 55:11.040
No.

55:11.042 --> 55:12.908
It's more complicated than that.

55:15.880 --> 55:19.014
But, yeah, I did.

55:22.987 --> 55:25.387
Hey, did they ever mention me?

55:25.389 --> 55:27.356
You killed my mother!
Nori!

55:34.065 --> 55:35.097
No.

55:35.099 --> 55:36.031
No, it's not like that, Nori.

55:39.070 --> 55:44.039
They were not good people, okay?

55:44.041 --> 55:45.441
They lied to you.

55:45.443 --> 55:47.576
My mother would never lie.

55:47.578 --> 55:48.844
I really wish that were true.

55:53.818 --> 55:59.388
Nori, listen.

55:59.390 --> 56:00.089
I'm your brother.

56:04.662 --> 56:06.628
What?

56:06.630 --> 56:10.432
I am your brother.
Wait.

56:36.961 --> 56:40.162
For the rest of our
family, the Kaisho was

56:40.164 --> 56:44.133
always beautiful, like yours.

56:44.135 --> 56:47.102
But to Mother,
mine was wretched.

56:47.104 --> 56:47.870
She'd never do that.

56:56.180 --> 56:59.047
Trauma started the Kaisho.

56:59.049 --> 57:01.917
The trauma is what
Mother gave to me.

57:05.790 --> 57:09.525
When I was a boy,
Mother would take me

57:09.527 --> 57:14.530
into the city on a train,
and I loved watching

57:14.532 --> 57:15.731
the sunset through the window.

57:18.469 --> 57:19.968
It was always beautiful.

57:23.174 --> 57:27.476
But one day, a man
came into the train

57:27.478 --> 57:31.613
and sat down very
close to Mother.

57:31.615 --> 57:35.083
He was a bad man.

57:35.085 --> 57:37.986
He was a bad guy.

57:37.988 --> 57:41.523
He kept staring at her.

57:41.525 --> 57:43.459
We got off the train.

57:47.865 --> 57:50.883
He followed us in the dark.

57:50.884 --> 57:53.902
And he showed up, and
he grabbed Mother.

57:53.904 --> 58:00.809
I pulled his arm,
and it turned to ash.

58:00.811 --> 58:06.782
But after that, Obaachan
looked at me as cursed.

58:06.784 --> 58:09.117
She wouldn't speak to me.

58:09.119 --> 58:12.087
I just wanted to
protect my mother.

58:12.089 --> 58:18.060
But Mother, she thought
she could change me.

58:18.062 --> 58:22.631
She pushed me hard,
pushed me to pain,

58:22.633 --> 58:25.067
and pushed me to hating her.

58:25.069 --> 58:30.672
And I even hated myself 'cause
I thought that was my fault.

58:30.674 --> 58:34.042
Mother finally realized
my Kaisho wouldn't change.

58:38.048 --> 58:42.751
It couldn't become
beautiful like yours.

58:42.753 --> 58:47.823
So one day, Mother
took me to a park.

58:47.825 --> 58:49.224
It was a cold day.

58:49.226 --> 58:51.527
It was sunny.

58:51.529 --> 58:55.664
Then she told me to wait.
I waited.

58:58.168 --> 59:06.975
I waited for her to come back,
not knowing that my family had

59:06.977 --> 59:08.544
gone to America.

59:13.951 --> 59:15.817
She didn't need me anymore.

59:18.756 --> 59:21.557
She had you.

59:21.559 --> 59:26.194
When I felt the pain of
being abandoned for good,

59:26.196 --> 59:29.665
my Kaisho grew stronger.

59:29.667 --> 59:35.804
After years of honing this
power, I told myself, one day,

59:35.806 --> 59:41.109
I'd find them and show
them what they left behind.

59:44.715 --> 59:45.280
Nori.

59:45.282 --> 59:47.816
Nori!

59:47.818 --> 59:49.751
Nori.

59:49.753 --> 59:51.086
Let go of me!

59:51.088 --> 59:52.654
Listen.
Listen!

59:52.656 --> 59:53.989
All right?

59:53.991 --> 59:54.957
Please.

59:54.959 --> 59:56.758
It's okay.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.260
I don't want to hurt you, Nori.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:03.599
I want to help you.

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:11.273
And I can show you what you're
really able to do, all right?

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:12.207
It's okay.

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:16.612
See?

01:00:16.614 --> 01:00:17.713
Take my hand.

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:20.382
It's okay.
See?

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:27.022
You feel it, huh?

01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:30.792
Let me teach you.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.161
Huh?

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:36.131
I can teach you.

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:37.132
It's all right.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:40.102
It's okay.

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:42.971
All right, come on.
Come on.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.373
It's okay.

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:45.340
Come with me.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:02.290
Hey, come on.

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:03.258
Let's go.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:10.866
Come on.

01:01:45.269 --> 01:01:47.469
Hey.

01:01:47.471 --> 01:01:49.037
Just grab what you need.

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:00.315
Murphy?

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:09.458
Nori.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:13.195
Oh, my God, honey, are you okay?

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:14.463
What happened?

01:02:14.465 --> 01:02:15.430
I don't know where to begin.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:54.136
You made the right decision.

01:02:57.241 --> 01:03:00.108
Let's do this.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:01.409
He wasn't going to hurt me.

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:02.144
Yeah, sure.

01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:03.111
Let's go.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.045
Stay here.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:12.554
I figure we play it
safe with this guy.

01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:13.822
Good luck.

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:28.370
Mr. Oshiro, I'm
Detective Murphy.

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:32.240
Yeah, we met.

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:35.076
Not officially.

01:03:35.078 --> 01:03:38.246
Can I ask you some questions?

01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:41.883
Yeah, go ahead.

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:48.824
On September 1, you visited
Kyoko Oshiro at the diner

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:51.893
she works at, right?

01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:55.931
Mm-hmm, yeah, I did.

01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:57.532
Do you remember what
happened that night?

01:04:04.975 --> 01:04:07.142
Oh, nothing special.

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:19.187
I just wanted to see my mother.

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:32.400
September 8, do you remember
where you were that night?

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:39.641
In the abandoned
warehouse on Spring Street,

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:40.942
where I killed my mother.

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:51.953
And a few days later, I killed
my grandmother in her home.

01:04:58.295 --> 01:05:01.196
Why would you kill your
mother and your grandmother?

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:06.201
Family issues.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:11.406
Did you love them?

01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:16.678
I loved them.

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:23.919
I loved them, and I
wanted to be loved.

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:29.557
What did you do to them?

01:05:29.559 --> 01:05:33.094
Did you burn them?

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.029
Not really.

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:41.369
Would you care to elaborate?

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:46.708
I could, but I bet you
would not understand.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:48.243
Why don't you try me?

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:06.361
Okay, it's a shame
she died so young.

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:12.600
Do you want to see her?

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:18.440
I can show you, right
here, right now.

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:23.278
Huh?

01:06:26.683 --> 01:06:28.583
Would you please
excuse me for a minute?

01:06:42.733 --> 01:06:43.765
What the hell was that?

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:53.541
We got him.

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:55.777
He admitted to
both of the murders.

01:06:55.779 --> 01:06:57.545
But I already told
you he killed them.

01:06:57.547 --> 01:07:00.115
Yeah, well, uh, he admitted
it, so now we can arrest him.

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:02.283
He's done.

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:03.618
What happens to him?

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.120
Well, he gets
booked and processed.

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:06.688
Assuming he maintains
this admission of guilt,

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.189
he'll go to prison.

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:09.457
And then from there,
we'll know when and how

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:11.526
long he's locked up for.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:12.660
Nori, what's going on?

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:22.504
Move, move.

01:07:22.506 --> 01:07:24.205
Sergeant, move
over here with me.

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:33.148
Get over here now.

01:07:41.525 --> 01:07:45.093
Watch the back door.

01:07:45.095 --> 01:07:46.494
Go.

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:48.830
Get out of here.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.750
Authorities are still gathering

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:11.453
information on the explosion
at the metropolitan police

01:08:11.455 --> 01:08:12.520
station.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.359
Lieutenant Tenwick,
we're ready in 20.

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:22.430
Let me talk to him first.
I can help.

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:23.665
No, Nori, he's too dangerous.

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:25.433
That's not going to happen.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.734
That's my brother.

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:31.339
This is my fault.
I need to fix it.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:34.109
Jake, I'll ping you
when we're ready, okay?

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:35.109
Murphy.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:37.345
Give me a second.
It's okay.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.517
Jake, I know this isn't what you
want to hear, but she's right.

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:44.336
Are you serious?

01:08:44.337 --> 01:08:46.154
We're not going to pull her in the
middle of this. It's our job.

01:08:46.156 --> 01:08:47.755
We don't even know what
we're dealing with here.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.256
We have to do everything
we can to stop this guy,

01:08:49.259 --> 01:08:53.328
and whatever Jin's got,
Nori's got it, too.

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54.295
Can't, sorry.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.135
Nori?

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.304
Nori?

01:09:05.742 --> 01:09:08.877
Nori!

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.225
Jin.

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:31.899
Are you alone?

01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:35.603
Yes, but not for long.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:36.537
Jin, they're coming for you.

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:42.844
I trusted you.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:43.611
Do you hear me?

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:44.379
I trusted you.

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.255
You don't deserve
what happened to you,

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:56.824
but that doesn't give you
the right to kill anyone.

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:58.493
Nori, listen.

01:09:58.495 --> 01:10:00.795
I was rescuing you, okay?

01:10:04.334 --> 01:10:05.800
It was all for you.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:08.336
You murdered them.

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:09.671
Don't say that.

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:11.539
What about those
police, those paramedics?

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:12.307
Don't say that!

01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:18.246
Jin, you have to
turn yourself in.

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:26.354
I know Mom and Obaachan
were not good to you.

01:10:28.992 --> 01:10:30.758
What they did was
wrong, and I'm sorry.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:46.874
You're just as
despicable as Mother.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:56.711
Nori.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:00.715
Nori!

01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:06.354
Nori, stop!

01:12:19.369 --> 01:12:21.769
Jake?
Jake?

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:24.038
Jake, honey?
Jake?

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.840
Oh, God, Jake.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:28.009
Jake, you're okay, honey.

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:28.976
Oh, God.

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:33.881
You're okay.

01:12:46.796 --> 01:12:47.829
You don't have to do this.

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:52.967
I'll go with you.

01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:56.070
It's too late.

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:58.039
It will be nice to
have family again.

01:19:13.049 --> 01:19:14.915
Are you sure you don't
want me to ride with you?

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:16.050
It's okay.

01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:20.020
I need to figure
these things out.

01:19:20.022 --> 01:19:22.990
Hey, so, um, I want
you to take this.

01:19:22.992 --> 01:19:27.361
It's not that much, but
I think it'll help you.

01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:28.329
Thank you.

01:19:35.538 --> 01:19:36.804
Hey.

01:19:39.342 --> 01:19:40.875
You will always have
a home here, okay?

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:45.112
Okay.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:07.034
I'll be back.
