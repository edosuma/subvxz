00:08.440 --> 00:10.101
- NO!

00:10.140 --> 00:11.539
NO, THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
WE HAD A DEAL.

00:11.570 --> 00:13.401
DOES THAT NOT MEAN ANYTHING
TO ANYBODY ANYMORE?

00:13.440 --> 00:15.579
WHAT, YOUR YES, NOT YES?
YOUR NO, NOT NO?

00:15.610 --> 00:17.441
I MEAN, IF THIS DOESN'T
GO THROUGH, I'M SCREWED.

00:17.480 --> 00:18.401
I'M SCREWED.

00:18.450 --> 00:24.480
I'VE GOT A MORTGAGE,
I HAVE A BABY, COME ON!

00:24.520 --> 00:25.680
OH, GEEZ.

00:30.790 --> 00:35.250
NO, LET ME CALL YOU BACK,
LET ME CALL YOU BACK.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.570
YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:51.610 --> 00:52.372
- BETTER THAN YOU, BEAMER.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.719
- WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.189
- WELL, NOW THIS SITUATION
IS ALL WRONG.

01:07.230 --> 01:08.754
- OH, COME ON.

01:14.470 --> 01:18.861
- TRUST ME,
I'M DOING THESE GLASSES A FAVOR.

01:18.910 --> 01:19.729
- UNH!

01:19.780 --> 01:22.271
- TAKING THE LADY
TO A SPA WEEKEND.

01:22.310 --> 01:23.277
WHAAAT?

01:23.310 --> 01:24.800
THAT'S BIG TIME, SON.

01:24.850 --> 01:26.442
- HE WOULDN'T EVEN TELL ME
HOW MUCH IT COSTS.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.414
- THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY, JULES.

01:28.450 --> 01:31.146
IT'S ABOUT GIVING YOU A VACATION
YOU SO RICHLY DESERVE.

01:31.190 --> 01:33.408
AND SPENDING AN ABSURD
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DO IT.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.758
- YOU ARE GROWING UP
RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.678
- COME ON, GUS,
YOU KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME.

01:37.730 --> 01:38.685
- YEAH.

01:38.730 --> 01:40.789
- BYE, GUS.

01:40.830 --> 01:42.764
- OKAY.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.495
MAKE SURE YOU WATER MY PLANTS,
THRICE DAILY.

01:44.530 --> 01:46.634
BUT DO NOT TALK TO THEM,
BECAUSE ONCE THEY GET STARTED

01:46.670 --> 01:48.467
THEY WILL NOT STOP,
ESPECIALLY JIM.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.535
- JIM IS THE FICHUS?
- YES, INDEED.

01:49.570 --> 01:52.539
- GOT IT.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.808
WHAT?

01:53.840 --> 01:56.343
- I NEED TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.549
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT.

01:59.580 --> 02:00.911
- YES, YOU DO.
- NO.

02:00.950 --> 02:03.180
- READY?

02:03.220 --> 02:07.281
- FINE.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.480
WAFFLES.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.829
- MY GOD, IT'S CRAZY, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.521
THAT WAS JUST A TEST.
- OKAY.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.599
- OKAY, HERE IT IS, READY?
- ALL RIGHT.

02:16.630 --> 02:18.518
STILL WAFFLES.
- DAMN IT.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.538
ONE MORE TIME.
- OKAY.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.505
- WHY ARE YOU GAZING
INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES?

02:26.540 --> 02:29.907
- WE'RE NOT DOING THAT,
JUST A ROUTINE FOREHEAD CHECK.

02:29.950 --> 02:33.340
RECIPROCATED.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.608
- LISTEN, SHAWN,
I KNOW YOU'RE NERVOUS

02:34.650 --> 02:36.208

BUT DON'T WORRY.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.478

- I'M GONNA CALL YOU, OKAY?
SO KEEP YOUR PHONE ON.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.652
- OH, YEAH.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.191
- THINK YOU CAN SURVIVE
FOR TWO DAYS WITHOUT EACH OTHER?

02:50.230 --> 02:52.232
- OF COURSE.
- [laughs]

02:52.270 --> 02:55.535
- LOOK, JULES, I KNOW THAT YOU
HAVE VERY DEFINITE EXPECTATIONS

02:55.570 --> 02:56.537
FOR THIS WEEKEND.

02:56.570 --> 02:57.559
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:57.610 --> 02:58.804
- WELL, YOU SENT ME AN EMAIL ON
THE FIFTH SAYING

02:58.840 --> 03:02.640
"SHAWN, I HAVE VERY DEFINITE
EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS WEEKEND."

03:02.680 --> 03:04.671
- RIGHT,
TO WHICH YOU RESPONDED,

03:04.710 --> 03:07.270
"SLUMBER PARTY,
NUDIE TIMES, DRINKY-DRINKY."

03:07.320 --> 03:09.447
- THAT'S MY
"OUT OF OFFICE REPLY."

03:09.490 --> 03:11.947
- LOOK, I JUST THINK
THIS TRIP IS IMPORTANT FOR US.

03:11.990 --> 03:14.458
IT'S OUR FIRST TIME
OUT OF THE SBPD BUBBLE

03:14.490 --> 03:15.752
AND WE'LL SEE HOW WE
REALLY ARE AS A COUPLE.

03:15.790 --> 03:16.859
- MMMMMMMM!

03:16.890 --> 03:18.380
- IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US

03:18.430 --> 03:19.658
TO TAKE OUR RELATIONSHIP
TO THE NEXT STEP

03:19.700 --> 03:21.292
IN A MATURE WAY.

03:21.330 --> 03:22.729
- I'M VERY EXCITED.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.762
NOW LET'S GO HAVE FUN.

03:31.510 --> 03:34.604

HELLO, GUSTER.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU SHOPPED HERE.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.673
- I HAD COUPONS.
- YES.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.541
THEY DO HAVE
SOME GOOD BARGAINS.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.514

GOOD LORD, YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
BUYING SCENTED CANDLES ARE YOU?

04:20.820 --> 04:22.685
- HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO
FRESHEN UP MY PLACE?

04:22.730 --> 04:23.526
- WELL, DO WHAT I DO,

04:23.560 --> 04:25.619
YOU PUT YOUR
LAUNDRY BASKET OUTSIDE,

04:25.660 --> 04:26.957
AND BLAST THE PLACE
WITH RIGHT GUARD.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.524

SHE STAYED IN PRISON.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.494
DON'T YOU USUALLY
SEE HER ON SATURDAYS?

04:30.530 --> 04:32.589
- YEAH, BUT SHE GOT
THROWN IN SOLITARY

SHE SURE HATES CUTSIES.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.601

04:40.640 --> 04:42.540
AND MAKE CRANK CALLS
ALL NIGHT.

04:42.580 --> 04:44.605

TO DO THAT.

WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR TENNIS

17:58.570 --> 18:00.538

WE WERE ROBBED.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.774
- YEAH...

18:03.550 --> 18:06.644

18:06.680 --> 18:08.443

18:08.480 --> 18:09.447
I'VE GOTI'A WARN THEM!

18:09.480 --> 18:12.142

18:12.190 --> 18:13.885

18:17.490 --> 18:19.629

18:19.660 --> 18:21.651

HELLO? WHO IS CALLING?

18:21.700 --> 18:24.828
- [laughs]

18:24.870 --> 18:26.519
CLIVE'S DOING A BIT.

18:26.570 --> 18:28.538
HE'S SO FUNNY.

18:28.570 --> 18:30.435

18:39.350 --> 18:42.342

[dial tone]

18:52.430 --> 18:54.352
- WE HAVEN'T FOUND
YOUR THINGS YET.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.289
- I NEED CLIVE NOBLE'S ROOM,
PLEASE.

19:00.770 --> 19:03.762
- THERE'S NO ONE BY THAT NAME
REGISTERED AT THE RESORT.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.532
TENNIS IS OFF.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.639
- ALL RIGHT, BEEF RIBS.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.648
AND...

19:13.680 --> 19:16.240
[laughs] BEEF RIBS.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.508
AND...

19:17.550 --> 19:19.245
MORE BEEF RIBS?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

19:19.290 --> 19:21.383
NEITHER OF YOU THOUGHT
TO BRING A VEGETABLE?

19:21.420 --> 19:22.512
- THIS IS A MAN'S _WEEKEND.
[cell phone rings]

19:22.560 --> 19:23.629
NOT A LADIES
ROTARY CLUB LUNCHEON.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.525
- YOU KNOW?
HELLO?

19:25.560 --> 19:27.425
- THIS IS
CAPITAL ONE FRAUD ALERT.

19:27.460 --> 19:29.951
THERE'S SOME SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY
ON YOUR CARD IN THE OJAI AREA.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.524
- FRAUD?
OJAI?

19:31.570 --> 19:33.629
DAMN IT, SHAWN.

19:33.670 --> 19:34.568
- SO SPENCER,
DID YOU CALL

19:34.600 --> 19:37.637
THAT LI'ITLE SENORITA
YOU MET LAST NIGHT?

19:37.670 --> 19:38.830
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
SHE'S A COUPLE OF DECADES

19:38.870 --> 19:40.576
SOUTH OF MY COMFORT ZONE.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.931
I JUST DID IT TO PROVE A POINT
THAT I'M STILL VIBRANT AND ALIVE

19:42.980 --> 19:44.607
AND I CAN STILL
REEL THEM IN.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.813
HENRY SPENCER, MASTER CASTER.

19:47.850 --> 19:50.580
- HEEEEEY!

19:50.620 --> 19:51.985
- HEY!

19:52.020 --> 19:54.614
I WAITED ALL MORNING
FOR YOU TO CALL ME

19:54.660 --> 19:56.218
BUT I GOT BORED.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.251
SO I DID A REVERSE SEARCH
ON THE INTERNET.

19:58.290 --> 19:59.257
- OH.

19:59.290 --> 20:02.453
- HEY'
- HEY!

20:02.500 --> 20:05.389
- HEY! I'M SO GLAD
I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP.

20:05.430 --> 20:06.692
- WHOO!

20:06.730 --> 20:07.697
[laughs]

20:07.740 --> 20:08.490
CHEERS.

20:08.540 --> 20:12.704
- YEAH, THIS IS
GONNA BE AWESOME.

20:12.740 --> 20:16.005
- [laughs] AWESOME!

20:16.040 --> 20:18.838
- SHAWN, CALM DOWN.
- HOW ABOUT YOU CALM DOWN, HUH?

20:18.880 --> 20:20.245
HOW ABOUT YOU CALM DOWN?

20:20.280 --> 20:21.542
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST PART IS, JULES?

20:21.580 --> 20:22.979
THEY JUST PRETENDED
TO LIKE US

20:23.020 --> 20:24.647
SO THAT THEY COULD
ROB US BLIND.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.612
SHE HAD YOU EATING
OUT OF THE PALM OF HER HAND

20:26.650 --> 20:28.584
WITH THAT LITTLE
PHONY PROPOSAL STORY.

20:28.620 --> 20:29.382
- WHAT ABOUT YOU AND CLIVE?

20:29.420 --> 20:30.523
YOU WERE FEEDING
EACH OTHER CAKE.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.721
- OKAY, SO I ADMIT I WAS
SEDUCED BY DELICIOUS FLAVOR.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.318
I AM JUST A MAN, JULES!

20:34.360 --> 20:36.726
- I FORBID YOU TO INVESTIGATE,
WE ARE ON VACATION.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.591
JUST LET THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES
DO WHAT THEY DO.

20:38.630 --> 20:42.760
- WHICH IS WHAT, EXACTLY, JULES?
THEY WEAR BERMUDA SHORTS.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.361
OH, MY GOD.

20:46.410 --> 20:48.605
THAT'S MY NINTENDO!

20:48.640 --> 20:51.404
- SHAWN...

20:51.450 --> 20:55.568
- GIVE ME THAT!

20:55.620 --> 20:56.712
- REALLY?

20:56.750 --> 20:57.614
- I'M...

20:57.650 --> 20:59.686
SORRY, LITTLE MAN.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.618
ENJOY YOUR STAY.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.957
HEY, DON'T RUN.

21:01.990 --> 21:03.924
THERE'S NO--
DIDN'T YOU READ THE SIGNS?

21:03.960 --> 21:05.848
- YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A CHILD, SHAWN.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.996
- I AM NOT ACTING!

21:09.030 --> 21:11.692
[cell phone rings]

21:11.730 --> 21:12.822
- WELL, IT IS ABOUT TIME.

21:12.870 --> 21:15.464
- SHAWN, THIS IS THE FOURTH
VACATION YOU'VE PAID FOR

21:15.500 --> 21:16.660
ON MY CREDIT CARD.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.598
- HOW ARE MY PLANTS?

21:17.640 --> 21:19.528
- IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU USED
MY COMPANY CARD

21:19.570 --> 21:20.878
TO PAY
FOR YOUR SUITE.

21:20.910 --> 21:22.832
BUT NOW YOU'RE TRAIPSING AROUND
DOING WINE TASTINGS?

21:22.880 --> 21:24.643
- IT WASN'T US, OKAY?

21:26.850 --> 21:29.318
- [sighs]
WHERE ARE THE CHARGES FROM?

21:29.350 --> 21:31.989
- SUTTON HOUSE WINERY
IN DEEP VALLEY VINEYARDS.

21:37.690 --> 21:39.385
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS,
THEY TOOK A WINE TOUR?

21:39.430 --> 21:40.556
- WHO?

21:40.600 --> 21:41.851
- WE KNOW THE PEOPLE
WHO STOLE IT, OKAY?

21:41.900 --> 21:43.925
AND I--I ALSO STILL
NEED TO TALK TO YOU

21:43.970 --> 21:46.564
ABOUT WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY
A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.739
BUT SINCE YOU TOOK A YEAR
TO CALL ME BACK, GUESS WHAT.

21:48.770 --> 21:51.364
I HAVE TO GO NOW.
- DO NOT HANG UP ON--

21:51.410 --> 21:52.536
[scoffs]

21:52.570 --> 21:53.537
- [sighs] JULES?

21:53.580 --> 21:55.707
- MM.
- I'M SO SORRY.

21:55.740 --> 21:57.742
I DIDN'T MEAN TO FLY
OFF THE HANDLE LIKE THAT.

21:57.780 --> 21:58.804
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.647
I THINK HOTEL SECURITY
CAN HANDLE THIS

22:00.680 --> 22:01.749
AND WE CAN ALWAYS
BUY NEW STUFF.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.817
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
IS IRREPLACEABLE?

22:04.850 --> 22:05.817
A LOVER'S RETREAT.

22:05.850 --> 22:06.817
- MM.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.909
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE DO SOMETHING ROMANTIC?

22:08.960 --> 22:10.757
- OOH, BALLOON TOUR?

22:10.790 --> 22:12.929
- GOD, NO.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.554
HOW ABOUT WE
GO WINE TASTING?

22:15.600 --> 22:17.397
- YEAH.

22:17.430 --> 22:18.897
- MM...MM!

22:18.930 --> 22:22.593
- THESE ARE THE BEST RIBS
I HAVE EVER EATEN.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.631
OH, MY GOD,
I'M A MESS.

22:24.670 --> 22:26.433
[laughs]

22:26.470 --> 22:27.630
- MA'AM, CANCEL
THE CARD IMMEDIATELY.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.500
THANK YOU.
- MM.

22:29.540 --> 22:31.440
- IS THAT HER SECOND SLAB?

22:31.480 --> 22:34.119
- I HAVE NEVER SEEN A WOMAN
EAT RIBS LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE.

22:34.150 --> 22:36.744
- MMM.
- EXCEPT IN CAVEMAN DRAWINGS.

22:36.780 --> 22:38.816
- LOOK, CHELS, HERE'S THE THING.
- MMM.

22:38.850 --> 22:40.408
- I THINK YOU'RE
AN AMAZING GIRL.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.711
- YEAH, YOU DO.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.682
- BUT DON'T YOU THINK
I'M A LITTLE OLD FOR YOU?

22:43.730 --> 22:45.857
- NO, I LIKE OLDER MEN.

22:45.890 --> 22:47.619
ESPECIALLY THE
BALDING, VIRILE TYPE.

22:47.660 --> 22:48.991
YOU KNOW.

22:49.030 --> 22:53.660
TERRY BRADSHAW, SEAN CONNERY--
OOH, DICK CHENEY.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.839
- OKEY DOKE.
- WOW, OKAY.

22:55.870 --> 22:56.859
UM, CHELSEA,

22:56.900 --> 22:58.436
IT WAS A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU.

22:58.470 --> 22:59.505
BUT I NEED TO
HEAD TO OJAI

22:59.540 --> 23:00.871
TO KILL MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE WORLD.

23:00.910 --> 23:01.729
- MM.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.407
- AND I NEED TO HELP HIM
BURY THE BODY.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.803
- OOH, BABE, CAN YOU
GET ME ANOTHER PULLER?

23:04.850 --> 23:06.647
- UH, YEAH--
GUYS, TWO THINGS.

23:06.680 --> 23:07.669
FIRST, WHAT'S A PULLER?

23:07.720 --> 23:09.745
SECOND, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.

23:09.780 --> 23:11.714
- OH, YOU KNOW,
AS MUCH AS I HATE TO LEAVE

23:11.750 --> 23:13.149
THE UNCOMFORTABLE HENRY SHOW,

23:13.190 --> 23:14.817
I'M GUSTER'S RIDE.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.418
YOU KIDS HAVE FUN NOW.

23:16.460 --> 23:20.829
[laughter]

23:20.860 --> 23:21.997
- OH, WOW, LOOKS LIKE

23:22.030 --> 23:23.827
THE PARTY'S OVER
A LITTLE EARLY, HUH?

23:23.870 --> 23:25.519

23:25.570 --> 23:26.992
- LOOK, WHY DON'T I PACK YOU UP
SOME, UH, POTATO SALAD TO GO?

23:27.030 --> 23:28.736

23:28.770 --> 23:30.067
WE'RE GOIN'
ROLLER BLADIN', YO!

23:30.100 --> 23:31.067
HOLLA!

23:31.110 --> 23:32.134
- WHO THE HELL

23:32.170 --> 23:33.535
WITH SEVEN POUNDS
OF RIBS IN 'EM?

23:33.580 --> 23:34.899
- CHELSEA DO, THAT'S WHO!

23:34.940 --> 23:37.647
[strange laugh]

23:37.680 --> 23:39.568
- [laughs]

23:41.720 --> 23:42.618
- WAIT!

23:42.650 --> 23:45.744
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

23:50.990 --> 23:54.153
[indistinct].

23:54.200 --> 23:55.724
- FOR OVER A CENTURY,

23:55.760 --> 23:57.694
MY FAMILY NAME
HAS BEEN SYNONYMOUS

23:57.730 --> 23:58.697
WITH THIS REGION.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.493
DE PALMA.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.837
IT'S ABOUT QUALITY...

24:01.870 --> 24:03.508
AND TRADITION.

24:03.540 --> 24:05.929
WE'VE NEVER CHANGED
AND WE NEVER WILL.

24:05.970 --> 24:08.677
I CAN'T WAIT TILL MY SON
GIANCARLO CARRIES ON

24:08.710 --> 24:10.769
THE DE PALMA NAME
WITH THE SAME PRIDE THAT I DO.

24:10.810 --> 24:12.072
ENJOY.

24:12.110 --> 24:14.044
- LOOK, I WAS ROBBED, OKAY?

24:14.080 --> 24:16.674
AND I'M DEALING WITH
A LOT OF CRAP RIGHT NOW.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.687
DO YOU GET THAT?

24:17.720 --> 24:21.258
IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES
RIGHT NOW, YOU WOULD...

24:21.290 --> 24:22.655
- OH, HEY, MAN.

24:22.690 --> 24:24.681
SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO INTERRUPT YOUR CALL.

24:24.730 --> 24:25.754
- OH, PLEASE, IF ONLY THAT WAS
THE WORST THING

24:25.790 --> 24:26.620
THAT HAPPENED TO ME
THIS WEEKEND.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.753
- OH, WELL, WHAT
DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.529
- UH, LET ME SEE,
I WAS ROBBED.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.630
SOME PUNK COUPLE
FAKES AN ACCIDENT ON ROUTE 33,

24:33.670 --> 24:35.535
AND WHEN I'M DUMB ENOUGH
TO CHECK ON THEM,

24:35.570 --> 24:37.094
'CAUSE I'M A GOOD SAMARITAN,
WHAT DO THEY DO?

24:37.140 --> 24:38.209
THEY ROB ME.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.265
- WHAT DID THEY LOOK LIKE?
- OF COURSE LIKE MODELS.

24:40.310 --> 24:42.835
THEY TOOK MY CAR KEYS,
EYE GLASSES, PHONE--

24:42.880 --> 24:44.677
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING
BUT MY SUNGLASSES.

24:44.710 --> 24:46.644
I HAD TO WALK FIVE MILES.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.648
FIRST IT WAS CLOUDY,
THEN IT WAS BLAZING HOT.

24:48.680 --> 24:49.647
- THAT EXPLAINS YOUR FACE.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.510
- IS IT OBVIOUS?

24:50.550 --> 24:53.087
- LOOKS LIKE SPAM.
- OH, GREAT, YEAH.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.052
- CHECK IT OUT, MAN.

24:54.090 --> 24:55.853
I THINK WE GOT ROBBED
BY THE SAME COUPLE.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.619
- WHAT?

24:57.660 --> 24:58.888
- YOU SEE, I'M A PSYCHIC MAN.

24:58.930 --> 25:01.558
AND MY SENSES LED ME
TO THAT PUNK COUPLE

25:01.600 --> 25:02.794
IN THIS VERY SPOT.

25:02.830 --> 25:05.799
- I KNEW YOU WERE INVESTIGATING.
SEAN, THIS IS OUR VACATION.

25:05.830 --> 25:07.058
I DON'T GET TO
DO THIS VERY OFTEN.

25:07.100 --> 25:12.003
- [woman screams]

25:15.710 --> 25:19.669
- [sigh]

25:19.710 --> 25:22.611
- "HOUSTON RAY WHITE
AND HOUSTON RAY ROSE

25:22.650 --> 25:24.538
IS CLEAN OUTTA SIGHT."

25:24.590 --> 25:26.615
- HOUSTON...

25:26.650 --> 25:27.856
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.065
- EXCUSE ME.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.034
O'HARA.

25:42.070 --> 25:42.991
- WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS DOING HERE?

25:43.040 --> 25:44.007
- WELL, I THOUGHT YOU COULD
USE SOME HELP

25:44.040 --> 25:46.133
FROM A DETECTIVE
NOT DRESSED AS A CUB SCOUT.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.979
- I CAME TO GET
MY CREDIT CARD BACK.

25:48.010 --> 25:50.001
- I'M HAVING
SOME LADY TROUBLES.

25:50.040 --> 25:53.840
- IT'S A LONG STORY.
- EXCUSE ME.

25:53.880 --> 25:54.915
- GUS!
- BOOM.

25:54.950 --> 25:56.872
A PAPER TRAIL OF DECEIT.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.717
- LOOK, I WAS
A VICTIM HERE TOO, MAN.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.012
- SHAWN, YOU ROBBED ME.

26:00.050 --> 26:00.880
AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED,

26:00.920 --> 26:02.581
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT
THAN THE THIEVES

26:02.620 --> 26:04.258
WHO ROBBED YOU
OF THE THING YOU ROBBED.

26:04.290 --> 26:05.257
- WOW.

26:05.290 --> 26:06.621
WELL, THAT HURTS, GUS.

26:06.660 --> 26:07.820
YOU KNOW WHY?

26:07.860 --> 26:08.827
BECAUSE WHEN I REALIZED
YOUR CARD WAS GONE

26:08.860 --> 26:09.895
I WAS SICK
TO MY STOMACH.

26:09.930 --> 26:10.999
- YET YOU STILL
MANAGED TO ORDER

26:11.030 --> 26:12.964
PAY-PER-VIEW AND SURF N' TURF
FOR TWO TO THE ROOM.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.060
- YES, TO MASK THE PAIN
THAT WAS RUNNING DEEP.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.864
AND EVERY BITE OF DELICIOUS
LOBSTER WAS A BUTTERY REMINDER

26:18.910 --> 26:20.161
OF YOUR FACE.

26:20.210 --> 26:22.599
- THE LOCAL COPS FOUND
A SPENT ROUND ON THE FLOOR.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.107
IT'S A .38 SPECIAL.

26:24.150 --> 26:27.074
- OH, NOW THAT
IS A CLASSIC.

26:27.110 --> 26:28.975
GO-TO MUNITIONS
FOR COPS AND SOLDIERS

26:29.020 --> 26:30.988
SINCE W-W-ONE.

26:31.020 --> 26:36.981
TYPICALLY USED IN REVOLVERS,
BUT NO STRANGER TO SEMI-AUTO.

26:37.020 --> 26:39.022
- I'M SENSING HOUSTON WAS KILLED
WITH HIS OWN GUN.

26:39.060 --> 26:42.223
- AND SENSE WHO
MIGHT HAVE DONE IT?

26:45.370 --> 26:46.689
- NICE WATCH.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.231
OMEGA SPEEDMASTER SPECIAL.

26:48.270 --> 26:51.728
ABOUT 100K RETAIL.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.237
- CLIVE AND BARBIE.

26:53.270 --> 26:54.635
- WHO THE HELL
ARE CLIVE AND BARBIE?

26:54.680 --> 26:56.932
- CLIVE AND BARBIE ARE
COLD-BLOODED MURDERERS,

26:56.980 --> 26:58.072
WHO LIE AND
MAKE TENNIS DATES

26:58.110 --> 26:59.998
THEY HAVE
NO INTENTION OF KEEPING.

27:00.050 --> 27:00.948
AND...

27:00.980 --> 27:02.845
THEY HAVE MY NINTENDO.

27:02.880 --> 27:03.881
- [sighs]

27:03.920 --> 27:06.946
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
O'HARA AND I WILL STAY HERE

27:06.990 --> 27:08.014
AND HELP THE
BARNEY FIFE BRIGADE

27:08.060 --> 27:09.948
COMB THIS PLACE FOR CLUES,

27:09.990 --> 27:11.184
YOU GUYS ALL HEAD BACK
TO THE HOTEL--WHY THE FACE?

27:11.230 --> 27:13.926
- UH, WELL, SHAWN AND I WERE
HOPING TO WORK ON THIS ONE...

27:13.960 --> 27:16.155
TOGETHER.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.929
- WHY?

27:17.970 --> 27:18.823
- WELL, IT'S OUR
ROMANTIC WEEKEND AWAY.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.134
WE'LL TAKE ANY ALONE TIME
WE CAN GET.

27:21.170 --> 27:22.159
- FINE.

27:22.200 --> 27:25.067
YOU TWO STAY HERE
AND DO WHATEVER POLICE WORK

27:25.110 --> 27:26.862
YOU FEEL ENHANCES
YOUR SENSE OF ROMANCE.

27:26.910 --> 27:27.979
THE REST OF US
WILL HEAD BACK TO THE HOTEL.

27:28.010 --> 27:29.329
HAPPY?
- ELATED.

27:29.380 --> 27:33.202
- I'M SO GLAD.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.013
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

27:35.050 --> 27:36.142
- SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

27:36.180 --> 27:37.272
- UH...

27:42.960 --> 27:45.884
I HAVE AN IDEA.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.871
- I WOULDN'T DO THAT, CLIVE.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.046
- GUYS!
- OH!

28:09.080 --> 28:11.048
- HEY!

28:11.090 --> 28:14.014
BARBIE AND I WERE JUST SAYING
THAT WE SHOULD HANG OUT AGAIN.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.210
MAYBE GO FOR A HIKE?

28:16.260 --> 28:17.010
- HI, JULES.

28:17.060 --> 28:19.153
OH, MY GOD,
I LOVE THOSE SHOES.

28:19.190 --> 28:20.327
- HMM.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.395
- HOT AIR BALLOONS.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.796
HOW MANY WAYS CAN WE THINK OF
TO KILL OURSELVES?

28:23.830 --> 28:26.958
- MAN, YOU GAVE CHELSEA THE SLIP
IN A BIG WAY, THAT WAS COLD.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.160
- I DIDN'T
GIVE ANYBODY THE SLIP.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.758
- YES, YOU DID.
- I DID NOT.

28:29.800 --> 28:30.960
I FOLLOWED UP WITH CHELSEA.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.069
I APOLOGIZED FOR
LEAVING SO ABRUPTLY

28:33.110 --> 28:34.998
AND SIMPLY INFORMED HER
THAT I WAS COMING UP HERE

28:35.040 --> 28:36.974
TO SPEND SOME TIME
WITH MY SON.

28:37.010 --> 28:38.978
YOU SEE, MY GENERATION EMBRACED
THE LONG FORGOTTEN VALUE

28:39.010 --> 28:40.910
CALLED RESPECT.

28:40.950 --> 28:42.212
I JUST HOPE
SHE GOT THE TEXT.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.946
- YOU NEVER, EVER TELL
A CRAZY WOMAN WHERE YOU ARE.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.309
- SHE'S NOT CRAZY.
- YES, SHE IS.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.910
- NO, SHE'S NEEDY,
AND I RESPECT THE DIFFERENCE.

28:48.960 --> 28:53.420
- [Chelsea laughing]

28:53.460 --> 28:56.793
- THAT CHICK IS BONKERS!
- TOLD YOU.

28:56.830 --> 28:57.990
- HEY!

28:58.030 --> 29:00.498
- HEY.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.964
- I KNOW YOU, RIGHT?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.228
- I'M GUS.
- RIGHT.

29:04.270 --> 29:06.909
- SO WHERE'S DADDY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

29:06.940 --> 29:08.476
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN A WHILE.

29:08.510 --> 29:09.477
- OOH.

29:09.510 --> 29:11.046
HEY, POP-POP.

29:11.080 --> 29:14.015
MAN, THERE ARE SOME CUTIES
UP IN HERE.

29:14.050 --> 29:17.019
LOOK AT THAT.

29:17.050 --> 29:17.948
- SO HOW'D YOU FIND US?

29:17.990 --> 29:20.117
- I'M A PSYCHIC.
- RIGHT.

29:20.150 --> 29:21.253
AND I ACTUALLY
PAID FOR DINNER.

29:21.290 --> 29:22.518
SERIOUSLY,
HOW'D YOU FIND US?

29:22.560 --> 29:24.824
- WE SAW THAT THE CREDIT CARD
WAS DECLINED A HALF MILE AWAY

29:24.860 --> 29:25.827
AND WE
PUT IT TOGETHER.

29:25.860 --> 29:27.919
- SO Y'ALL ARE COPS?

29:27.960 --> 29:30.019
THAT IS SEXY.
- HUH.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.824
NORMALLY CIVIL SERVANTS
CAN'T AFFORD THE PLACES WE HIT.

29:32.870 --> 29:33.791
- OKAY, ENOUGH!

29:33.840 --> 29:35.239
IT'S CONFESSION TIME,
WHERE'S MY NINTENDO?

29:35.270 --> 29:36.498
- SERIOUSLY?

29:36.540 --> 29:38.462
- [laughs]

29:38.510 --> 29:40.831
DUDE, I THINK
WE PITCHED THAT.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.474
- OH, GOD.

29:43.510 --> 29:47.810
- OH, NOW I FEEL BAD.
- OH, BABY.

29:47.850 --> 29:49.249
- YOU GUYS LIED TO US!

29:49.280 --> 29:51.487
YOU MADE US BELIEVE THAT YOU
REALLY LIKED US AS PEOPLE!

29:51.520 --> 29:54.011
- AND THEY KILLED SOMEONE.
- COME AGAIN?

29:54.060 --> 29:55.516
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE ALSO,
BUT IT'S THE LYING.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.582
- WELL, OF ALL
THE PEOPLE WE'VE ROBBED,

29:58.630 --> 29:59.927
WE LIKE YOU
GUYS THE BEST.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.053
- IT'S TRUE, SHE
WENT ON AND ON ABOUT IT

30:02.100 --> 30:03.829
THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE
RIFLING THROUGH YOUR STUFF.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.326
BUT WE DIDN'|'\|I'C5(ILL ANYONE.

30:05.370 --> 30:06.564
- SURE YOU DIDN'T.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.091
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
A DEAD MAN'S WATCH?

30:09.140 --> 30:12.029
- LOOK, WE BROKE INTO HIS ROOM,
WE TOOK HIS WATCH

30:12.070 --> 30:14.038
AND A BRIEFCASE
FULL OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.331
BUT THAT'S IT.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.404
WE ARE DIRTY THIEVES,

30:16.440 --> 30:18.078
BUT WE ARE
BASICALLY NICE PEOPLE.

30:18.110 --> 30:19.907
AND WE ARE TOTALLY
AGAINST ANIMAL CRUELTY.

30:19.950 --> 30:21.178
- AND ILLEGAL DOWNLOADING.

30:21.220 --> 30:25.088
PIRACY MAKES ME SICK.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.041
- WAIT A MINUTE.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.411
THAT'S NOT THE GUN
THAT KILLED HOUSTON RAY.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.052
- THAT'S A FAKE,
IT'S A PROP.

30:30.090 --> 30:31.887
WE STOLE IT FROM A MOVIE
WE WERE WORKING ON.

30:31.930 --> 30:33.158
- YEAH.
- YOU GUYS WORKED ON A MOVIE?

30:33.190 --> 30:35.192
- YEAH.
- AS EXTRAS.

30:35.230 --> 30:37.050
THE WILD STALLION.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.159
- THE WILD STALLION
WITH CONNIE SELLECA?

30:39.200 --> 30:40.064
[police sirens]

30:40.100 --> 30:41.897
- OH, SHE IS A TOTAL PRO,
NO ATTITUDE.

30:41.940 --> 30:42.895
- SHE IS
ALL ABOUT THE WORK.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.532
- YOU GUYS
ARE HORRIBLE PEOPLE,

30:44.570 --> 30:46.106
BUT YOU'RE SO COOL!

30:46.140 --> 30:47.266
[police sirens]

30:47.310 --> 30:48.937
- SHAWN, YOU
GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.107
DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE'D KILL A GUY FOR HIS WATCH?

30:51.150 --> 30:53.471
AND KEEP ROBBING HIGHWAYS
JUST A FEW MILES AWAY?

30:53.510 --> 30:54.442
- COME ON, SIR.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.038
- WHAT WAS THE TIME OF DEATH
ON HOUSTON RAY?

30:56.080 --> 30:56.944
- STAND UP.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.481
- UH, LOCAL CORONER
SAID ONE PM, WHY?

30:58.520 --> 30:59.714
- HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

30:59.750 --> 31:02.457
- OKAY, UH, WHERE'S THE LAST
PLACE YOU TRIED TO USE THE CARD?

31:02.490 --> 31:04.082
- COME ON.
- UH, TARGET.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.223
BUT IT WAS DECLINED.
OH, SO EMBARRASSING.

31:06.260 --> 31:07.329
WE'RE THE
REAL VICTIMS HERE!

31:07.360 --> 31:10.124
- I LOVE YOU, BABY.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.628
- SO WHO KILLED THE TEXAN?

31:12.670 --> 31:14.991
- OUR HOUSE RED
IS FROM DE PALMA VINEYARDS--

31:15.040 --> 31:18.305
- SOON YOU'LL SEE MY FACE ON
EVERY BOX OF THAT JESUS JUICE.

31:18.340 --> 31:21.207
- DE PALMA,
IT'S ABOUT TRADITION.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.935
WE'VE NEVER CHANGED
AND WE NEVER WILL.

31:22.980 --> 31:25.608
- WE HAVE TO GO
WINE TASTING AGAIN.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.914
- YOU TOLD THE POLICE
YOU HAD NEVER SEEN THE GUY

31:27.950 --> 31:28.769
FOUND DEAD HERE TODAY.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.345
- WELL, LOTS OF PEOPLE
VISIT MY WINERY,

31:31.390 --> 31:35.087
I MEAN, HE'S NOT THE FIRST
PERSON TO DIE DURING A TASTING.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.610
- IT'S Ol-TEN THAT PEOPLE
ARE SHOT IN THE GUT

31:36.660 --> 31:38.059
AND DUMPED
IN A BARREL?

31:38.090 --> 31:44.029
- NO, THAT WAS NEW.
- HEH.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.992
TELL YOU WHAT I THINK,
I THINK YOU KNEW THE TEXAN.

31:46.030 --> 31:47.566
VINEYARD IS STRUGGLING,

31:47.600 --> 31:49.238
HE COMES IN HERE,
WANTS TO BUY YOU OUT.

31:49.270 --> 31:51.306
BUT YOU WOULD RATHER LIQUIDATE
THAN TURN YOUR FAMILY BUSINESS

31:51.340 --> 31:52.637
OVER TO
A WINE BOX MOGUL.

31:52.670 --> 31:54.433
SO HE WOULDN'T
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER,

31:54.480 --> 31:56.129
YOU LIQUIDATED HIM.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.943
- [laughs] YOU COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG.

31:57.980 --> 31:58.947
- DAMN IT.

31:58.980 --> 32:00.140
- LOOK, I'LL BREAK IT DOWN.

32:00.180 --> 32:03.149
I HATE THE WINE BUSINESS.

32:03.180 --> 32:05.944
I HATE OJAI AND
I HATE MY FAMILY.

32:05.990 --> 32:06.945
- WHAT?

32:06.990 --> 32:08.184
EVEN YOUR SON GIANCARLO?

32:08.220 --> 32:09.619
- I DON'T HAVE A SON
AND IF I DID

32:09.660 --> 32:11.127
I'D HATE HIM TOO.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.321
THAT'S JUST A SPIEL
THAT I GIVE IN THE WINERY

32:13.360 --> 32:14.327
DURING THE TOURS.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.089
IT'S ALL MALARKEY.

32:16.130 --> 32:18.394
MY NAME IS
NOT EVEN DE PALMA.

32:18.430 --> 32:20.625
IT'S GOLDBERG.

32:20.670 --> 32:22.490
GUNNER GOLDBERG.

32:22.540 --> 32:26.101
I MEAN, WOULD YOU BUY WINE
FROM A GOLDBERG VINEYARDS?

32:26.140 --> 32:27.107
- MAYBE SPRITZER.

32:27.140 --> 32:28.698
- THAT TEXAN
WAS MY TICKET OUT.

32:28.740 --> 32:30.537
HE COULD HAVE PUT A PICTURE
OF HIS ASS ON THE BOX

32:30.580 --> 32:31.547
FOR ALL I CARE.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.104
- THAT I'D BUY.

32:33.150 --> 32:34.549
CU RIOSITY.

32:34.580 --> 32:37.219
- I WAS SO DESPERATE TO UNLOAD
I ALMOST ACCEPTED

32:37.250 --> 32:39.241
A LOW BALL OFFER
FROM THIS OTHER SCHMUCK.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.009
BUT THE GUY, I MEAN,
HE'S LEVERAGED TO THE HILT.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.755
MONEY FROM ALL SORTS
OF ILLEGAL SOURCES AND--

32:43.790 --> 32:45.018
- AND WHO IS THAT?

32:45.060 --> 32:47.381
- A REAL SAD SACK.

32:47.430 --> 32:50.558
- LISTEN TO ME, I AM DEALING
WITH A LOT OF CRAP RIGHT NOW.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.669
A LOT OF CRAP.

32:51.700 --> 32:54.066
- SAD SACK.

32:54.100 --> 32:59.003
WAS HIS NAME JERRY?
- YEAH.

33:00.340 --> 33:02.672
- ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
JERRY KINCAID'S ROOM.

33:02.710 --> 33:04.598
HOUSEKEEPING!

33:04.650 --> 33:05.639
- LOOKS LIKE NOBODY'S HOME.

33:05.680 --> 33:06.772
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LOOK,
WE GOTTA KEEP MOVING.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.038
CHELSEA COULD BE ANWVHERE.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.014
- THIS ROOM IS SWEET!

33:10.050 --> 33:10.744
IT HAS ITS
OWN STEAM ROOM.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.384
- YOU CAN GO.

33:12.420 --> 33:14.149
- YOU COULD HAVE JUST ASKED ME
TO OPEN THE DOOR, YOU KNOW.

33:14.190 --> 33:15.612
INSTEAD OF
PULLING YOUR GUN ON ME.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.184
- SORRY,
IT'S FORCE OF HABIT.

33:17.220 --> 33:19.051
- JERK.

33:19.090 --> 33:20.352
- THAT'S FAIR.

33:20.390 --> 33:26.124
GUYS?

33:26.170 --> 33:27.569
- DROP THE GUN, DETECTIVE.

33:27.600 --> 33:32.299
OR I SWEAR I WILL SHOOT
EVERYBODY IN THEIR STUPID FACES!

33:34.810 --> 33:36.129
[pistol hammer clicks]

33:45.550 --> 33:46.778
- THANKS.

33:46.820 --> 33:49.084
IT'S NOT LIKE LASSITER
TO NOT ANSWER HIS PHONE.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.327
- THIS IS ALL YOU.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.657
SO...

33:52.690 --> 33:55.557
JERRY WANTED TO BUY THE WINERY
BUT HOUSTON SWOOPED IN,

33:55.600 --> 33:57.158
HE'S TAKING
THE DEAL AWAY.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.065
- JERRY JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
THE KILLER TYPE.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.567
- WELL, AS WE'VE LEARNED
THIS WEEKEND, JULES,

34:00.600 --> 34:03.194
PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS
WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.764
EXCEPT ON REALITY TV.

34:04.810 --> 34:08.598
WE'RE ARE THE REAL HOUSEWIVES
OF SOMEWHERE.

34:08.640 --> 34:10.574
- WHAT IS IT YOU--
- JERRY CONFRONTS HOUSTON.

34:10.610 --> 34:13.579
THE TEXAN LAUGHS,
ALL TEXAN LIKE.

34:13.610 --> 34:14.577
- [laughs]

34:14.620 --> 34:16.349
- AND JERRY
LOSES HIS SCHLITZ.

34:16.380 --> 34:17.472
THAT'S A THING, RIGHT?

34:17.520 --> 34:19.385
- PRETTY SURE
THAT'S A MALT LIQUOR.

34:19.420 --> 34:22.184
- SO, CLEARLY
THERE WAS A STRUGGLE.

34:22.220 --> 34:24.757
JERRY ENDS UP
WITH THE TEXAN'S GUN.

34:24.790 --> 34:26.257
- NOW CALM DOWN, FRIEND.

34:26.290 --> 34:27.188
[indistinct arguing]

34:27.230 --> 34:32.588
- WITHOUT THINKING--
BOOM! HE SHOOTS HIM.

34:32.630 --> 34:34.234
OR MAYBE HE WAS THINKING,
AT THIS POINT

34:34.270 --> 34:35.294
IT'S IMMATERIAL.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.295
- SHAWN, THE STEAM ROOM.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.706
- JULES, COME ON,
WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE.

34:38.740 --> 34:40.264
IT'S NOT THE TIME
TO STEAM IT OUT.

34:40.310 --> 34:41.277
[laughs]

34:41.310 --> 34:42.470
- SHAWN, THE STEAM ROOM!

34:42.510 --> 34:46.469
- WOW, YOU ARE
A RANDY LITTLE LASS.

34:46.510 --> 34:48.171
- UNH!

34:48.220 --> 34:50.279
- OOOH!

34:50.320 --> 34:52.311
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING IN THERE?

34:52.350 --> 34:53.510
- JERRY TRAPPED US!

34:53.550 --> 34:54.756
- WELL, HOW
DID HE DO THAT?

34:54.790 --> 34:56.519
- WHY DOESN'T OUR ROOM
HAVE A STEAM ROOM?

34:56.560 --> 34:59.688
- JULES, I GOT THE BEST
AVAILABLE ROOM THAT THEY HAD.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.595
- WITH MY CREDIT CARD!

35:01.630 --> 35:05.293
- COME ON, JERRY GOT
A HEAD START, LET'S GO!

35:05.330 --> 35:07.195
- HENRY! HENRY!

35:07.230 --> 35:08.766
[laughs]

35:08.800 --> 35:11.200
HENRY?
- AAH!

35:11.240 --> 35:13.299
- SQUINTY GUY,
SUNBURN, REAL SAD SACK?

35:13.340 --> 35:16.173
- OH, YEAH, I SAW THE GUY
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.303
HE LEI-T ABOUT
TEN MINUTES AGO

35:18.350 --> 35:19.203
IN A SILVER SEDAN.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.740
- HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO CATCH HIM NOW?

35:20.780 --> 35:22.816
- I'LL CATCH HIM.

35:22.850 --> 35:24.784
- CARLTON, THERE ARE FIVE
DIFFERENT WAYS OUT OF HERE

35:24.820 --> 35:25.912
YOU'LL JUST BE GUESSING.

35:25.950 --> 35:28.157
- WHOA, WHOA!
- GO, GO!

35:28.190 --> 35:30.750
- MAYBE NOT, FOLLOW ME
TO THE ACTIVITIES DESK.

35:30.790 --> 35:33.179
- THAT CHICK
IS A FREAK!

35:33.230 --> 35:34.857
-AAH!

35:34.900 --> 35:38.768
[tires squealing]

35:49.610 --> 35:50.577
- WOULD YOU SETTLE?

35:50.610 --> 35:51.577
- I THINK Al-TER
THIS WEEKEND

35:51.610 --> 35:53.407
I CAN GO WITHOUT
SEEING YOU GUYS FOR A WHILE.

35:53.450 --> 35:57.671
- AGREED!
- AGREED!

35:57.720 --> 35:59.449
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THIS GUY.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.514
[cell phone rings]

36:00.550 --> 36:04.429
all: [grunting, mumbling]

36:04.460 --> 36:05.654
- YEAH, SPENCER!

36:05.690 --> 36:07.180
- LASSIE, I CAN SEE YOU!

36:07.230 --> 36:08.219
WE'RE IN THE SKY!

36:08.260 --> 36:10.194
WE COMMANDEERED A BALLOON
FROM THE TOUR DESK!

36:10.230 --> 36:11.868
- OKAY, LET'S DO THIS!
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

36:11.900 --> 36:13.265
- UH...

36:13.300 --> 36:15.268
I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE NAMES
PER SE...

36:15.300 --> 36:17.461
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S CROSSING OVER A BRIDGE!

36:17.500 --> 36:19.309
- CHEESE, ANYONE?

36:19.340 --> 36:20.830
both: NOT NOW, FELIPE!

36:20.870 --> 36:23.407
- WHERE--WOULD YOU GET YOUR
ELBOW OUT OF MY FACE?

36:23.440 --> 36:27.274
- WELL, HE'S PASSING A
BIG, RED, WOODEN BUILDING!

36:27.310 --> 36:30.916
- THAT'S SETTLER'S HOMESTEAD,
HOME OF THE FIRST SILK FACTORY

36:30.950 --> 36:32.440
IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
IN 1887.

36:32.490 --> 36:33.809
CRACKERS?

36:33.850 --> 36:35.909
- OOH, APPLES.
- IT'S SETTLER'S HOMESTEAD!

36:35.960 --> 36:38.224
- WHO--WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

36:38.260 --> 36:40.626
- IT'S THE FIRST SILK FACTORY,
IT WAS BUILT IN 1887!

36:40.660 --> 36:41.957
- EIGHTEEN EIGHTY WHAT?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.524
- 87, 87!

36:43.560 --> 36:45.221
- WELL, HOW IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO HELP ME?

36:45.270 --> 36:49.366
- WILL YOU MOVE OVER?
- YOU MOVE OVER!

36:57.010 --> 36:58.841
- OH, YEAH,
LASSIE, I SEE YOU AGAIN!

36:58.880 --> 36:59.904
YOU'RE RIGHT BEHIND HIM!

36:59.950 --> 37:02.771
HIS ROUTE GOES THE LONG WAY,
YOU CAN CUT HIM OFF!

37:02.820 --> 37:04.014
UH, TAKE THE UPPER ROAD,

37:04.050 --> 37:05.017
AND FLOOR IT!

37:05.050 --> 37:06.381
- WAIT, OKAY, LEI-T?

37:06.420 --> 37:07.444
- JUST TURN! TURN!

37:07.490 --> 37:09.879

37:09.920 --> 37:10.909
RIGHT HERE,

37:15.500 --> 37:21.268
AAAARRGHH!

37:21.300 --> 37:23.268
- SLICE, SLICE!
- SLICE WHAT?

37:23.300 --> 37:24.506
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SLICE?

37:24.540 --> 37:25.962
NOT YOU!
I'LL TAKE A SLICE OF CHEESE.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.307
- OH, HERE.

37:27.340 --> 37:29.376
- UH, THE ORANGE KIND.
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

37:29.410 --> 37:31.230
- MMM.

37:32.680 --> 37:35.717
[incoherent mumbling]

37:35.750 --> 37:36.910
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU SAYING?

37:36.950 --> 37:39.487
- I'M SO SORRY,
MY MOUTH IS FULL OF CHEESE!

37:39.520 --> 37:41.511
IT'S MUCH HOTTER
THAN I WAS ANTICIPATING.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.379
- IT'S JALAPENO CHEDDAR.

37:42.420 --> 37:44.012
- SPENCER, GET YOUR HEAD
IN THE GAME,

37:44.060 --> 37:47.826
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

37:47.860 --> 37:51.990
- HE'S COMING RIGHT AT YOU!

37:52.030 --> 37:55.363
- THERE HE IS!
I GOT YOU NOW!

37:55.400 --> 37:57.038
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
- NO, NO, LASSITER!

37:57.070 --> 37:58.731
[screaming, yelling]

37:58.770 --> 38:01.375
- LASSITER, LASSITER!

38:01.410 --> 38:03.071
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

38:03.110 --> 38:05.374
- AAH!
[tires squealing]

38:05.410 --> 38:07.799
[screaming, yelling]

38:07.850 --> 38:13.015
[tires squealing]

38:13.050 --> 38:14.358
- UNH!

38:29.440 --> 38:32.637
- GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE!

38:32.670 --> 38:34.729
YOU DROP THAT WEAPON
OR I WILL DROP YOU!

38:34.780 --> 38:36.998
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

38:37.040 --> 38:38.644
YOU GOT IT WRONG,
YOU GOT IT WRONG.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.671
THIS IS ALL A BIG
MISUNDERSTANDING.

38:40.710 --> 38:41.916
COME ON.

38:41.950 --> 38:43.713
- TURN AROUND,
FACE YOUR VEHICLE.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.581
GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES,
CROSS YOUR ANKLES,

38:45.620 --> 38:46.644
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR HEAD.

38:46.690 --> 38:47.839
- WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M A GYMNAST?

38:47.890 --> 38:49.050
THAT'S CRAZY,
I'M NOT THAT FLEXIBLE.

38:49.090 --> 38:50.387
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- JUST DO IT.

38:50.420 --> 38:51.626
- GOD.

38:51.660 --> 38:53.059
- SURPRISINGLY
GOOD WORK, SPENCER.

38:53.090 --> 38:55.957
WE GOT HIM.
- YEAH, YOU SEE?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.456
JERRY WAS LEVERAGED
TO THE HILT

38:57.500 --> 38:58.990
WITH SOME
PRETTY TOUGH CUSTOMERS.

38:59.030 --> 39:01.089
WHEN THE TEXAN SWOOPED IN
TO BUY THE VINEYARD,

39:01.130 --> 39:03.462
JERRY FOUND HIMSELF
ON THE HOOK TO INVESTORS

39:03.500 --> 39:04.569
FOR A DEAL
HE COULDN'T MAKE.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.066
- I WILL SHOOT YOU!
UNBELIEVABLE.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.101
- FACED WITH A CHOICE--
[cell phone beeps off]

39:08.140 --> 39:11.576
HELLO? HELLO?

39:11.610 --> 39:12.747
HUH.

39:12.780 --> 39:14.577
[laughs]

39:14.620 --> 39:16.679
AAH.
- SHOULD WE HEAD BACK NOW?

39:16.720 --> 39:20.019
- NO, FELIPE, I DO BELIEVE
WE'D LIKE TO TAKE

39:20.050 --> 39:22.917
THE LONG WAY HOME.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.552
- OUR ADULT VACATION.

39:24.590 --> 39:25.989
- DO YOU WANNA SEE HOW LONG
IT TAKES FOR THIS GRAPE

39:26.030 --> 39:26.985
TO HIT THE GROUND?

39:27.030 --> 39:30.796
- OH, I DO,
I REALLY DO.

39:30.830 --> 39:32.889
[gaSPSI
- HERCULES! I HIT A HOUSE!

39:32.930 --> 39:34.397
- TRY THE APPLE SLICES.
- YUP.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.489
- PLEASE STOP THROWING THINGS.
- OH, SORRY, FELIPE.

39:37.540 --> 39:38.905
- SORRY, FELIPE.

39:38.940 --> 39:40.601
- PARTY POOPER.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.733
FELI-POOP.
- MM-HMM.

39:42.780 --> 39:45.101
- WE'RE REALLY UP HERE.
- YEAH, WE ARE.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.139
- I'M GONNA
KISS YOU ON THE MOUTH.

39:46.180 --> 39:48.000
- MM.
[kissing]

39:54.460 --> 39:57.657
- HEH, NICE VACATION, HUH?

39:57.690 --> 39:58.918
- IT WASN'T A DISASTER.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.427
GOT A HOT AIR BALLOON RIDE.

40:00.460 --> 40:02.189
DIDN'T COUNT ON THE DEAD TEXAN
IN THE WINE BARREL,

40:02.230 --> 40:03.993
BUT MY FISH THE FIRST NIGHT
WAS DELICIOUS.

40:04.030 --> 40:05.520
- I LET YOU DOWN,
DIDN'T I?

40:05.570 --> 40:08.198
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
- OH, I DID A LITTLE.

40:08.230 --> 40:11.802
WHEN I LOOK AT CLIVE AND BARBIE,
THEY'RE SUCH A GREAT COUPLE.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.000
- SHAWN, THEY'RE CRIMINALS.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.678
- YEAH, BUT THEY'RE DEVOTED.

40:14.710 --> 40:15.972
- AND WE'RE NOT?

40:16.010 --> 40:18.001
- NO, WE--
NO, WE ARE, WE ARE.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.099
I JUST...

40:20.150 --> 40:22.516
LOOK, JULES, I KNOW YOU HAVE
THESE DEFINITE EXPECTATIONS,

40:22.550 --> 40:24.074
RIGHT?

40:24.120 --> 40:28.011
AND THAT IN A PERFECT WORLD
I'D BE A LITTLE LESS LIKE ME,

40:28.050 --> 40:29.017
YOU KNOW?

40:29.060 --> 40:30.948
A LITTLE MORE MATURE,
AND OPEN TO THINGS LIKE

40:30.990 --> 40:32.958
DANCING AND TRIPS TO IKEA.

40:32.990 --> 40:35.788
AND I CAN DO THAT,
YOU KNOW?

40:35.830 --> 40:37.229
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE TO.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.467
I WANT TO.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.922
FOR YOU.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.767
AND FOR US AS
TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS.

40:42.800 --> 40:43.960
- OKAY.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.763
- I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR COMMITMENT.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.129
AND...

40:47.170 --> 40:49.730
AND THE "M" WORD.

40:49.780 --> 40:52.169
AND SOME SUCH...

40:52.210 --> 40:53.848
- YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT WHEN
I SAID "DEFINITE EXPECTATIONS"

40:53.880 --> 40:54.972
THAT I MEANT--

40:55.020 --> 40:56.169
- NO.

40:56.220 --> 40:58.211
NO, NO, NO, NO,
OF COURSE NOT.

40:58.250 --> 40:59.148
- [sigh of relief]

40:59.190 --> 41:00.782
- THAT WOULD MEAN
I'M A COMPLETE MORON.

41:00.820 --> 41:01.855
NO, I DIDN'T--
[laughs] I DIDN'T THINK THAT.

41:01.890 --> 41:04.154
- BECAUSE I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE

41:04.190 --> 41:07.159
HEADED DOWN THE RIGHT PATH
AND WE ARE.

41:07.190 --> 41:09.055
I MEAN, JUST COMING HERE,
THIS MORE THAN MEETS

41:09.100 --> 41:10.920
MY CURRENT EXPECTATIONS.

41:10.960 --> 41:14.259
I'M NOT READY
TO GET MARRIED.

41:14.300 --> 41:15.494
- ARE YOU?
- OH, GOD, NO.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.030
NO, NO, NO.

41:17.070 --> 41:18.765
I MEAN,
IT'S ON MY BUCKET LIST.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.109
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
UH, [laughs] HELLS NO.

41:22.140 --> 41:26.839
THANK YOU FOR BEING
SO MUCH SMARTER THAN ME.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.199
[kissing]

41:28.250 --> 41:31.174
- HM?

41:31.220 --> 41:33.688
[laughs]

41:33.720 --> 41:36.018
- WELL, I HOPE YOU
LOOK THAT GOOD

41:36.060 --> 41:38.051
WHEN I'M 140.

41:38.090 --> 41:40.126
- YOU KNOW I WILL.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.593
- I'M SORRY, SIR.

41:41.630 --> 41:43.097
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DISPUTE
THE ROOM CHARGES.

41:43.130 --> 41:45.598
I MEAN, WHO ORDERS
PISTACHIO ICE CREAM

41:45.630 --> 41:46.927
AT 1:00 A.M.?

41:46.970 --> 41:48.961
- WE FOUND THIS IN ONE OF
THE DUMPSTERS OUT BACK

41:49.000 --> 41:49.796
OF THE RESORT.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.034
I BELIEVE THIS IS
ONE OF THE ITEMS

41:51.070 --> 41:52.560
STOLEN FROM
MR. SPENCER'S ROOM.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.635
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN
A GROWN MAN SO UPSET

41:54.680 --> 41:55.704
OVER THE THEl-T OF A TOY

41:55.740 --> 41:57.037
THAT WASN'T HIS CHILD'S.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.298
- WE TAKE OUR HANDHELD
ENTERTAINMENT VERY SERIOUSLY.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.500
- WELL, THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.182
