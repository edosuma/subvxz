Hey, everybody.

Where's the buttery butter

00:51.052 --> 00:53.986
Oh, here,
you can have the chimney.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.654
I love you, my boy.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.322
Well, I'm not eating.

00:57.324 --> 00:59.825
I need to look orphan-thin

RALLO:
Good morning, everybody.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.504
Notice something?

01:12.506 --> 01:14.206
Not much.
A lot.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.408
Rallo, why are you
Porky Pigging it?

01:16.410 --> 01:19.211
Because I slept all night
without a pull-up.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.180
Boom! Dry! Bone dry!

01:21.182 --> 01:22.514
You know what
this means?

01:22.516 --> 01:24.016
Silk boxers?

01:24.018 --> 01:25.751
He can stop
sleeping in the tub?
Nothing?

01:25.753 --> 01:29.021
It means he's not
a baby anymore.

01:29.023 --> 01:31.056
Oh, my God,
you're right!

01:31.058 --> 01:34.026
This a monumental day!

01:34.028 --> 01:37.129
We can finally get rid of all
his baby crap in the garage.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.031
Hang a tennis ball in there.

01:39.033 --> 01:42.034
Park it just right every time.

01:43.570 --> 01:47.139
Rallo, bring the kerosene
from your bedroom!

Junior, bring your torch!

01:52.045 --> 01:53.112
ROBERTA:
No! Stop!

01:53.114 --> 01:54.646
You forgot his baby book

01:54.648 --> 01:57.216
and the CD of all
his baby photos.

01:57.218 --> 02:00.886
Rallo, today you

Mm.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.486
Cleveland,
I've been thinking.
What?

02:34.488 --> 02:36.355
I'm 42 years old,
Oof.

02:36.357 --> 02:39.691
and there are some things I'm
afraid I won't be able to do--

02:39.693 --> 02:41.260
have a successful career,

02:41.262 --> 02:43.095
backpack across Europe.

02:43.097 --> 02:45.130
Or wear a bathing suit
without a skirt on it.

Or have another baby.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.267
Mm-hmm.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.668
Well, night, now.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.969
Cleveland...

02:50.971 --> 02:52.938
I want to have
another baby.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.306
Uh? Wha...?

02:54.308 --> 02:56.308
I want to have
another baby.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.210
Donna, we just
got rid of a baby.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.779
Let's enjoy our
twilight years in peace.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.648
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:02.650 --> 03:03.982
I have to write a letter.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.284
Long hand.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.852
In the bathroom.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.221
Peen, pen, pen, peen.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.119
(bat hits ball,

03:42.822 --> 03:44.323
Cleveland,
if we did have a baby,

03:44.325 --> 03:46.058
I would need some help.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.527
So I thought we'd get
a sexy live-in nanny.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.295
Girls!

03:53.233 --> 03:54.833
Nope.
Send 'em back.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.503
DONNA:
All right, girls.
Back on the bus.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.372
Please no make us.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.507
We have so much herpes.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.243

04:08.782 --> 04:10.215
I messed myself.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.750
I love you, Daddy.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.552
It ain't working, Donna.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.654
What's Miss Donna
got to do with this?

04:20.360 --> 04:25.430

♪ I'm...

04:25.432 --> 04:27.266
♪ Singing.

Stop, stop, stop.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.203
That was awful.
I've heard enough.

04:31.205 --> 04:32.537
Did I get the part?

04:32.539 --> 04:34.306
Yes. Next!

04:34.308 --> 04:36.208
Look at me, I'm swinging!

04:36.210 --> 04:38.310

04:45.219 --> 04:46.752
Hey, stage manager.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.987
Why are you
stage managing?

04:48.989 --> 04:50.789
Because there were no
burly lesbians around

04:50.791 --> 04:52.090
who wanted to do it.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.259
Ha! That's who
does that job.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.994

your extra shirt.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.829

I have an extra shirt?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.164
Come on, man.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.632
Fat guys always have
an extra shirt.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.635
All that sweating,
food dribbling, lactation.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.103
Okay, okay.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.139
Go get it from my locker.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.741

05:09.743 --> 05:11.076
Stage name.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.344
All right.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.346

05:16.316 --> 05:18.183
Leapin' lizards, Daddy Warbucks!

05:18.185 --> 05:19.985

Wait.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.321
I don't need to hear any more.
You've got the role...

05:22.323 --> 05:25.290
Really?!
...of kicking the stool
out from under me

05:25.292 --> 05:28.093
as I hang myself
because you were so dreadful.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.096
Oh, it looks like
I'll never find my Annie.

05:31.098 --> 05:34.800
Man, Junior's shirt is
unexpectedly large on me.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.602
I feel like Al Roker
after his third surgery.

05:37.604 --> 05:40.205
Except all this would be skin.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.108
That'll work.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.376

I just waxed the floor.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.378

Wait, what's that?

05:50.283 --> 05:52.084

Hit the lights!

Cue the music!

05:54.388 --> 05:56.888
(playing "Hard Knock Life"

05:58.991 --> 06:02.361
I think we've found our Annie!

06:02.363 --> 06:04.329
What? Him?

06:04.331 --> 06:05.664
Yes.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.866
This play will be
an historic display

06:07.868 --> 06:11.403
of color-blind, gender-blind,
talent-blind casting.

06:11.405 --> 06:15.807

all the way to an Obie Award!

06:15.809 --> 06:18.377
But, Mr. Gargalode,
who am I gonna play?

06:18.379 --> 06:20.679
It's "Miss," and I'm gonna
throw you a bone.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.148
And by that, I
mean you can be the dog.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.716
But you...

06:24.718 --> 06:26.251
you are the star.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.319
Me?

06:27.321 --> 06:28.653
I'm a star?

06:28.655 --> 06:30.722
I want to make a rap album.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.894
Hey, baby.
Get it?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.429
There was an
explosion at work.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.164
I can't hear anything.
Good night.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.867

Hmm?

06:41.869 --> 06:44.436
So, there was
no explosion at work.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.505
There was, I just
wasn't there.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.507
Isn't there a part of you
that's curious to see

06:48.509 --> 06:50.342
what the two of us
would make together?

06:50.344 --> 06:52.744
Someone
with my determination,

06:52.746 --> 06:54.446
good looks,
and upper-body strength,

06:54.448 --> 06:56.515
and your last name?

06:56.517 --> 06:58.383
I do have a good last name.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.419
Oh, Cleveland,
just look at Rallo.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.354
They grow up so fast.

07:02.356 --> 07:04.556
Junior's not gonna take baths
with you forever.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.057
I'll take that bet.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.392

07:28.215 --> 07:29.948
BRUCE WILLIS:

Ha ha!
Baby called boobies "lunch."

07:41.762 --> 07:45.397

07:45.399 --> 07:47.833
Look who's sobbing.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.301
Donna. Wake up.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.402
I want to make a baby.

07:50.404 --> 07:51.670
You do?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.004
What made you
change your mind?

07:53.006 --> 07:54.573
<i>Look Who's Talking</i> movie.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.142
We're gonna have a dumb baby.

08:03.749 --> 08:05.083
Kids, great news.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.651
We're having
a talking baby.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.086
Like Verne Troyer?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.521
Exactly.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.523
What this means is
when Mommy and Daddy

08:11.525 --> 08:13.091
put a sock on
their doorknob,

08:13.093 --> 08:14.493
we do not bother them,

08:14.495 --> 08:16.795
no matter how bad
the dream was,

08:16.797 --> 08:18.530
or how thirsty we are.

08:18.532 --> 08:22.300
Or how much we hear what sounds
like a mugging in progress.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.702
Or what sounds like

08:23.704 --> 08:26.705
wet chicken breasts slapping
against each other.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.006
Mmm.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.308
Or a boot being
pulled out of the mud.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.510
Ooh.

08:31.512 --> 08:35.814
Or like someone mixing
macaroni and cheese.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.383
(sultry music plays)

08:39.218 --> 08:40.819
Cleveland.
Right.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.187
Kids, clean that mess up.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.622
(both giggling)

08:43.624 --> 08:45.657
So let me get this right.

08:45.659 --> 08:49.227
You make a baby with mud,
chicken and mac and cheese?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.962
That's what Paula Deen
is made of.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.430
Ha! Got her.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.803
Come on, Sandy,
we're going to N.Y....

08:58.805 --> 09:00.138
(clears throat)

09:00.140 --> 09:01.640
I could use a
glass of water.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.008
Junior, you mind
getting me some water?

09:03.010 --> 09:04.709
There's a water fountain
right there.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.913
We can't have our star
drinking from a public fountain.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.282
That water's 90% lead.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.055
And while you're at it,
get me some Pringles.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.723
(groans)

09:22.695 --> 09:25.830
I am wore out.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.666
<i>Monday Night Raw.</i>

09:29.035 --> 09:30.602
Is anyone curious why?

09:30.604 --> 09:32.237
Curious? No.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.605
Trapped? Yes.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.107
Guys, Donna and I
are making a baby.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.442
No, you're not.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.077
What?
You got a vasectomy.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.378
No, I didn't.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.080
Yeah, you did.
Six months ago.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.182
We all got drunk and
played Truth or Dare.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.684
Holt got a tramp stamp,

09:45.686 --> 09:46.885
you got a vasectomy,

09:46.887 --> 09:48.186
and Tim tried meth.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.588
One time, one time.

09:50.456 --> 09:51.623
Okay, two.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.124
A vasectomy?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.627
So that's why my boys
hurt for three weeks.

09:55.629 --> 09:58.930
I thought a spider had
laid eggs in there.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.700
Donna?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.602
There's something serious
we need to talk about.

10:04.904 --> 10:07.706
Mm. Down, Brown.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.207
Donna, a few weeks ago,

10:09.209 --> 10:11.543
while presumably
blackout drunk, I...

10:11.545 --> 10:14.546
Cleveland, I sent the kids
on a six-minute errand.

10:14.548 --> 10:16.214
You know what that means.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.550
No one will
hear me whimper?

10:18.552 --> 10:21.853
(Cleveland whimpers happily)

10:23.089 --> 10:26.091
♪

10:26.093 --> 10:28.627
Leapin' lizards, Daddy Warbucks!

10:28.629 --> 10:30.729
Your mansion is way better

10:30.731 --> 10:33.131
than mean ol'
Miss Hannigan's orphanage.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.600
Annie, you're all right.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.669
Oh! This is stupid dumb.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.105
How come Rallo gets to
rehearse on Skype?

10:40.107 --> 10:42.340
Because he was unhappy
with the humidity level

10:42.342 --> 10:43.742
in the auditorium.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.244
Annie got to have her frizz.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.313
You know, just
a thought on Sandy...

10:48.315 --> 10:49.914
I think to really sell "dog,"

10:49.916 --> 10:52.150
she should be eatin'
real dog food.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.819
Oh, my God!
Get out of my brain! Yes!

10:54.821 --> 10:56.354
Annie, got your gum!

10:56.356 --> 10:57.956
(laughing)

10:57.958 --> 10:59.758
I got that,
did you get it?
Yeah, I got it.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.859
That's Hubba Bubba.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.460
I asked for
Dubble Bubble.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.595
They're both gum.

11:03.597 --> 11:04.996
They are not both gum.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.698
When I ask for something,
I get it!

11:06.700 --> 11:08.033
And this goes
for all of you!

11:08.035 --> 11:09.701
Turn me. You!

11:10.336 --> 11:12.437
Turn me. You!

11:12.439 --> 11:14.005
Turn me again. And you!

11:14.007 --> 11:15.440
Me?

11:15.442 --> 11:16.641
All of you!

11:16.643 --> 11:19.444
If Annie's not happy,
you got no show.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.446
WALLY:
It's you <i>have</i> no show.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.615
And by the way,
you do have no show.

11:23.617 --> 11:26.718
If you want to do a musical,
you have to pay for the rights.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.219
ALL:
Oh...

11:28.221 --> 11:29.821
I've heard that.
Yeah, I've heard that more.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.489
And since we spent
all our budget

11:31.491 --> 11:33.658
on Rallo's grandiose
demand-ee-ohs,

11:33.660 --> 11:35.293
we have no money.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.861
Therefore, no play.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.530
What demand-ee-ohs?

11:38.532 --> 11:40.598
Well, your trailer, for one.

11:42.134 --> 11:43.468
What?

11:43.470 --> 11:44.736
I'm not gonna be a star?

11:44.738 --> 11:47.539
Exactamundo-rooney!

11:48.741 --> 11:49.841
Thank God.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.710
Rallo was turning
into such a diva.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.144
He was so mean.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.548
But his occasional compliments
made me walk on air.

11:58.851 --> 12:02.387
The thing is, my wife and I
have been having crazy sex.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.489
Lights on, clothes off,

12:04.491 --> 12:06.558
first names... everything.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.860
But turns out I had a vasectomy.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.729
Is there any chance I could
still get her pregnant?

12:10.731 --> 12:12.397
Zero.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.399
But the procedure
is reversible.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.834
Great! Let's do it.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.869
Okay, just put this on,

12:17.871 --> 12:20.171
while I disclose a few of
the potential side effects.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.273
First, fluid buildup

12:22.275 --> 12:23.842
and swelling of
the genitals.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.744
Always a concern.
Go on.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.712
Bleeding in scrotum.
Okay.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.214
And sperm granuloma.

12:29.216 --> 12:32.450
I prefer milk on my granuloma
in the morning.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.252
Oh, (laughs), yes, I see.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.855
No, no, no, sperm granuloma
occurs when

12:36.857 --> 12:40.225
sperm leaks into your scrotum
and forms an inflamed mass.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.026
Oh.
But don't worry.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.294
I've done this twice on a dummy.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.863
Now lie back and relax.

12:45.865 --> 12:49.200
Now to make
the initial incision...

12:49.202 --> 12:51.302
I'll try to match
your natural seam,

12:51.304 --> 12:53.905
so as not to slice
against the grain.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.273
Preesh.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.809
All right, I've made the cut...

12:57.811 --> 12:59.244
and I've made a mistake.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.645
Nurse, abort the procedure.

13:00.647 --> 13:01.713
What? What happened?

13:01.715 --> 13:03.715
Shh, shh, shh, now,
now, now, now, now.

13:03.717 --> 13:05.083
I'm trying to concentrate.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.384
There it is!
Got it! No!

13:06.386 --> 13:07.719
Whoops!
It's all you.

13:07.721 --> 13:08.753
I've got it,
I've got it!

13:08.755 --> 13:10.088
No, no, don't step on it!

13:10.090 --> 13:11.422
Oop...

13:11.424 --> 13:13.825
And I owe you a
new cup of coffee.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.161
You know what, Doc?

13:16.163 --> 13:18.730
I'm gonna pray on this.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.498
(Cleveland whimpers)

13:21.734 --> 13:23.601
Gotta come clean.

13:23.603 --> 13:24.769
Don't let her seduce you.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.005
I will not get turned on.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.507
CCH Pounder on the toitey.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.110
CCH Pounder
on the toitey.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.745
CCH Pounder on the toitey...

13:33.747 --> 13:34.946
No! No hump!

13:34.948 --> 13:37.749
Cleveland, I'm pregnant!
No.

13:37.751 --> 13:39.384
Yes.
Really?

13:46.592 --> 13:48.626
So, you're pregnant.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.128
Are you sure?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.330
Cleveland, I've been
pregnant five times.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.431
Yeah, I'm sure.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.667
How could this be?
(laughs)

13:55.669 --> 13:58.336
You acting like you weren't
there when it happened.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.437
Of course I was.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.005
I had to have been.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.474
What possibly could've
snipped my involvement?

14:03.476 --> 14:06.311
You know, they say babies can
hear everything in the womb.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.712
Do you want to say "hi"?

14:07.714 --> 14:09.180
I'd love to.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.716
I don't know who you are,

14:11.718 --> 14:13.318
or how you got there,

14:13.320 --> 14:15.820
but I'll never
love you. Ever.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.489
And I'm going to follow
your mother until I find out

14:18.491 --> 14:20.391
who your father is,

14:20.393 --> 14:24.162
and then lord it over her
until she is destroyed.

14:24.164 --> 14:27.465
That is the only way
to repair this relationship.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.734
Love you.
Oh...

14:29.736 --> 14:33.805
I probably will love you,
after I see your little face.

14:37.142 --> 14:39.444
(giggles)
(chuckles)

14:41.213 --> 14:43.414
(sighs)

14:44.583 --> 14:46.351
Good-bye, Annie.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.354
For us, there is no tomorrow.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.389
(sobbing)

14:51.391 --> 14:52.557
(sobbing)

14:52.559 --> 14:53.758
Rallo?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.927
Ro-Ro! J.J.!

14:55.929 --> 14:58.930
I'm so sorry I got the
show-show shut down.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.932
I ruined it,
not just for me

15:00.934 --> 15:03.568
but for you guys,
and that terrible cast.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.436
I let it all go to my head.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.273
And now I'm the most
pathetic thing on earth:

15:08.275 --> 15:10.708
a former child star.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.543
Now if you'll excuse me,

15:12.545 --> 15:14.512
I'm gonna go get this over with
and hold up a Laundromat.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.047
Rallo, wait.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.916
I think there's a way
to do the show

15:17.918 --> 15:19.717
even without the rights.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.719
We'll do our own
knockoff version!

15:21.721 --> 15:23.187
Ack, ugh!

15:23.189 --> 15:24.522
Girl don't know
how to whisper.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.391
I am whispering!

15:26.393 --> 15:28.927
DONNA:
And so then Dr. Fist called
to talk to Cleveland,

15:28.929 --> 15:31.262
and I find out
he had a vasectomy

15:31.264 --> 15:33.464
and refused to
get it reversed.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.633
So to get back at him,
I've been faking a pregnancy.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.569
So suddenly we're friends?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.872
I have no one else
to talk to.

15:40.874 --> 15:43.875
So how long you gonna
keep up the ruse?

15:43.877 --> 15:45.410
I won't tell the truth

15:45.412 --> 15:47.745
until he admits the truth
about his vasectomy.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.114
But don't you still
want a baby?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.950
Oh, I can always
have a baby.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.718
But how often do I get to

15:53.720 --> 15:56.120
have the upper hand
against my husband?

15:56.122 --> 15:59.724
You know, when I can really
rub his face in it.

15:59.726 --> 16:03.594
Your people's marriages
are so interesting.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.130
Let's go shower off.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.103
How dare Donna lie to me?

16:12.105 --> 16:14.672
She drew first blood.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.974
Not me.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.543
I guarantee Kendra
whizzed in here.

16:22.114 --> 16:25.016
So what are you going
to do about Donna?
Nothing.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.617
I won't admit I'm lying

16:26.619 --> 16:28.619
until she admits
she's lying.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.989
That's gonna be
kind of rough.

16:30.991 --> 16:34.859
Not nearly as rough as the hands
of this guy massaging me.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.628
Want to take it
down a notch, Sven?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.630
(deep voice):
Sorry, sir.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.166
And... boom
goes the dynamite.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.670
Cleveland?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.538
I'm home, and nauseous
with morning sickness

16:47.540 --> 16:49.040
because I'm pregnant.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.909
Cleveland?

16:53.345 --> 16:55.179
Oh, hey, Donna.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.915
I was just finishing up
the paint job on the nursery.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.987
Now, before I unwrap
this expensive, Swedish,

17:02.989 --> 17:07.025
non-returnable-once-opened
crib set I spent $2,000 on,

17:07.027 --> 17:08.726
is there anything
you want to tell me?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.128
Two thousand...!

17:10.130 --> 17:13.164
No. Is there anything
you want to tell me?

17:13.166 --> 17:16.467
No. My lovely, pregnant wife.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.102
Nothing.

17:24.076 --> 17:25.209
Ah! I'm blind!

17:25.211 --> 17:26.911
Oh.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.082
(woman screaming)

17:31.084 --> 17:33.184
Put the 3D glasses
back on, Cleveland.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.019
I mean, we have
to be prepared.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.755
Unless there's something
you want to tell me.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.057
(woman moaning)

17:39.059 --> 17:40.591
(gagging): No.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.260
Is that...?

17:42.262 --> 17:44.262
Ah, she's pooping!
She's pooping!

17:44.264 --> 17:45.863
It's the miracle of...

17:45.865 --> 17:48.266
(retching)

17:50.836 --> 17:52.370
Excuse me, excuse me.

17:52.372 --> 17:55.039
Huge, nine-months-pregnant wife
coming through.

17:55.041 --> 17:58.076
But her boobs haven't gotten
any bigger for some reason.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.211
Thank you for coming, everyone.

18:00.213 --> 18:03.681
And now, with the approval
of our team of lawyers...

18:03.683 --> 18:05.383

19:09.749 --> 19:12.283
Looks like we have no choice.

19:12.285 --> 19:15.686
I'm finally gonna meet you,

19:44.517 --> 19:45.850
Careful.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.351
That's a lot of
sudden movement.

19:47.353 --> 19:51.189
You know, for the baby
that's under your shirt.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.293
My water broke.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.460
So we're really
doing this?

19:56.462 --> 19:58.563
I guess we are.

Push!

20:03.336 --> 20:04.669
(groans)
Push!

20:04.671 --> 20:05.970
(screams)

20:05.972 --> 20:07.305
Oh, the pain!

20:07.307 --> 20:08.573
It's so real.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.708
Give me more morphine.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.677
Um, you've had kind of a lot.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.479
Especially considering there's
just a couch cushion in there.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.148
Aha! Liar!

20:17.150 --> 20:18.583
You were never pregnant!

20:18.585 --> 20:20.818
You're the liar!
You had a vasectomy!

20:20.820 --> 20:22.186
If I may interject...

20:22.188 --> 20:23.254
you're both
terrible people

20:23.256 --> 20:24.722
who should not
have any children.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.390
In fact, I am not
even comfortable

20:26.392 --> 20:27.725
sending that cushion
home with you.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.427
Shh, shh, shh.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.928
You're with Daddy now.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.496
Oh, he's right.

20:32.498 --> 20:34.498
I'm exhausted just pretending
to have been pregnant.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.500
I'm 42 years old.
Ugh.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.236
What was I thinking?

20:38.238 --> 20:40.371
I don't have the energy
to have another baby.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.506
Plus, I gained 20 pounds.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.841
Higher, Bob.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.743
Yeah, I'm always tired.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.445
That baby would've died.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.348
What do you say,
instead of a baby,

20:50.350 --> 20:52.116
we just get a couple hammocks
for the side yard?

20:52.118 --> 20:53.751
Ooh! Or maybe one
of those big ones

20:53.753 --> 20:56.254
we can lie in together.
Or maybe a couple
one-person ones.
