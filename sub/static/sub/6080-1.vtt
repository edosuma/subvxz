00:30.559 --> 00:34.348
The legend began
beneath these dark hills

00:34.413 --> 00:36.791
and under this same sky.

00:37.724 --> 00:41.216
It tells of a sword
of great power,

00:41.289 --> 00:44.202
forged for the conqueror
Julius Caesar.

00:45.304 --> 00:48.547
This weapon was passed down
until it reached

00:48.613 --> 00:53.487
the last of Caesar's noble line,
the emperor Tiberius.

00:54.781 --> 00:59.172
On his death it was hidden away
to keep it from the hands of evil men.

01:00.273 --> 01:02.738
For generations
it lay in a secret place.

01:02.811 --> 01:05.822
marked by the sign
of a pentangle

01:05.895 --> 01:10.222
and as it was written.
under the very gaze of Caesar.

01:11.805 --> 01:15.047
I, Ambrosinus, born in Britannia...

01:16.400 --> 01:19.028
was one of many men who sought it.

01:21.603 --> 01:22.884
In a time of injustice,

01:22.952 --> 01:26.577
I made it my life's task
to find the sword

01:26.647 --> 01:29.440
and the one righteous
enough to wield it.

01:29.505 --> 01:32.298
I journeyed far
across the Continent,

01:32.365 --> 01:35.956
through the heart of an empire
that ruled half the known world.

01:37.183 --> 01:42.221
Now a threatened Rome
was calling back her bravest and best

01:42.290 --> 01:44.273
to defend her boundaries.

02:14.091 --> 02:15.658
Make way!

02:28.354 --> 02:30.084
Good to be home,
Commander?

02:30.827 --> 02:33.040
Is this what I'm supposed to wear?

02:33.108 --> 02:35.057
I can't even remember
how to put it on.

02:37.285 --> 02:38.632
Why ask, Vatrenus, hmm?

02:39.373 --> 02:40.588
Why me?

02:40.657 --> 02:43.899
because they trust you.
You are a true Roman.

02:43.966 --> 02:48.741
besides, 'tis a glorious thing,
they say, to guard the new Caesar.

02:48.816 --> 02:51.061
We held Africa for them
for 10 years,

02:51.130 --> 02:52.794
grew old on their battlefields,

02:52.864 --> 02:54.945
lost good men.

02:56.044 --> 02:57.676
What was it all for?

02:57.746 --> 03:01.404
We're soldiers, Aurelius.
Politicians make the decisions.

03:02.597 --> 03:05.511
Two breeds of men
to be avoided like the pox-

03:05.585 --> 03:08.443
...politicians and philosophers.

03:11.367 --> 03:14.312
You know, in Alexandria
they cut off the hand that steals.

03:14.385 --> 03:15.338
No, please.

03:15.414 --> 03:17.912
Once the hand is off, it's for God
to decide whether you live or die.

03:19.269 --> 03:20.255
Most die.

03:21.550 --> 03:22.502
Batiatus!

03:24.858 --> 03:27.487
Do it outside. It'll make a mess.
blood everywhere.

03:35.555 --> 03:37.703
- Who's this?
- Thief. Caught in the act.

03:37.772 --> 03:38.724
I'm not a thief.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.398
Now he's yours, big man.

03:41.401 --> 03:43.899
- One hand or two, Commander?
- Oh, just the one.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.438
No, let me go, please!

03:55.504 --> 03:58.515
I wasn't gonna steal it, I swear to you!
I give you my word.

03:58.587 --> 03:59.902
Your word?

04:00.837 --> 04:02.403
You?

04:02.474 --> 04:05.168
A street boy? A thief?

04:05.237 --> 04:06.803
How can you be
a man of your word?

04:06.874 --> 04:08.123
I just wanted to look at it.

04:09.670 --> 04:13.328
I am Aurelianus Caius Antonius,
commander of the Imperial Guard.

04:13.396 --> 04:15.992
I am asking you,
do you lie to me?

04:19.305 --> 04:21.255
I would not lie to you.

04:26.535 --> 04:28.232
You come back in ten years, boy.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.668
I'll give you your own sword.

04:33.088 --> 04:34.237
Now get out.

04:35.753 --> 04:38.832
Another worthy foe
vanquished then, Commander.

04:41.214 --> 04:45.606
It's heartening to see
soldiers of Rome display such valor.

04:45.679 --> 04:46.313
Who are you?

04:46.385 --> 04:50.175
One who knows humiliation
to be a poor teacher...

04:51.364 --> 04:52.799
for both men and boys.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.186
I smell a philosopher.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.852
Are you all right?

04:58.753 --> 05:01.634
- Take the boy and go.
- In our own good time.

05:08.487 --> 05:11.313
Hey. He said go, old man.

05:12.947 --> 05:14.612
More than a philosopher, then.

05:36.912 --> 05:37.963
How'd he do that?

05:38.035 --> 05:41.396
Every time we have goose for dinner,
you do that same old trick.

05:41.472 --> 05:42.425
Oh, dear.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.613
Have I done that one before?

05:44.684 --> 05:46.185
And I didn't need your help.

05:49.150 --> 05:51.044
Either way, you missed
your Greek lesson.

05:51.110 --> 05:53.541
How come you never told me
you knew how to fight?

05:55.285 --> 05:57.562
Get out of here,
both of you. Go, go!

05:58.433 --> 05:59.420
Let them pass.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.507
- Odoacer.
- Orestes.

06:11.924 --> 06:14.170
For ten years
I have supported Rome.

06:14.238 --> 06:15.969
Ten years my warriors

06:16.037 --> 06:17.931
- have fought beside your legions.
- Who is that?

06:17.997 --> 06:19.825
The commander of the Goths.

06:19.891 --> 06:22.235
So now here I am...

06:22.301 --> 06:24.414
to claim my dues.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.150
And what are your dues, General?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.267
One-third of all Italy.

06:29.336 --> 06:30.968
You think I'm joking?

06:31.038 --> 06:33.151
Is this true, Orestes?
Did you make such a pact?

06:33.222 --> 06:37.362
No... how could I promise
what isn't mine to give?

06:37.430 --> 06:39.708
One-third of Italy.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.824
That way the alliance continues

06:41.896 --> 06:43.691
and your new Caesar

06:43.760 --> 06:47.187
will not topple from his throne
like the others before him.

06:47.260 --> 06:50.984
I promised you nothing beyond
the reward you were already given.

06:53.557 --> 06:55.954
You've grown so tall, Orestes...

06:56.929 --> 06:59.525
you forget whose shoulders
you stand on.

07:06.340 --> 07:08.936
Romulus, where have you been?

07:09.843 --> 07:11.573
We've been looking everywhere.

07:12.445 --> 07:17.001
Ambrosinus, you took him
outside without a guard?!

07:17.070 --> 07:18.570
- You know the danger.
- No, I-

07:18.644 --> 07:21.471
It's a fine morning.
We went for a walk. No harm done.

07:21.536 --> 07:24.581
You know what
tomorrow holds for him?

07:25.583 --> 07:26.733
For all of us.

07:26.804 --> 07:28.533
I know perfectly well, Orestes.

07:28.602 --> 07:30.496
I have as much care
for your son as you have.

07:30.561 --> 07:32.161
What did you say?

07:35.766 --> 07:38.811
You go too far, schoolmaster.

07:38.882 --> 07:40.579
Leave us.

07:42.576 --> 07:48.195
Orestes, sometimes I think you
forget he is just a boy.

07:48.263 --> 07:51.854
He has your blood in his veins,
bloodline of the Caesars.

07:51.924 --> 07:53.939
He was never just a boy.

08:01.465 --> 08:07.467
Mother, in five years
there have been five emperors...

08:08.595 --> 08:09.910
and they were all murdered.

08:13.541 --> 08:15.142
What will happen to me?

08:19.421 --> 08:21.820
You will be guarded by the best.

08:21.895 --> 08:26.188
You will live long and rule wisely.

09:26.044 --> 09:26.996
My son...

09:28.260 --> 09:30.953
this day you join the immortals.

10:03.724 --> 10:08.050
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

10:11.112 --> 10:13.542
Mother, am I now the most
powerful man in the world?

10:13.617 --> 10:14.569
You are.

10:14.645 --> 10:16.957
Then why can't I stay out
on the day I am crowned?

10:18.532 --> 10:20.713
What am I to be,
a god or a boy?

10:23.447 --> 10:28.354
You are Caesar,
and my Caesar must be protected.

10:29.646 --> 10:31.180
but who would harm me?

10:31.253 --> 10:34.232
The one you saw,
Odoacer the Goth.

10:34.305 --> 10:35.684
He is our ally.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.379
And you, teacher
of words and numbers,

10:38.448 --> 10:40.791
what is the business
of the state to you?

10:42.013 --> 10:45.190
My only concern
is the welfare of your son.

10:45.259 --> 10:47.854
You make concern yourself no longer.

10:47.925 --> 10:49.207
He is Caesar now.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.654
He's still a boy.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.132
Perhaps he still needs me.

10:52.196 --> 10:54.957
Well, your task is over.

10:55.024 --> 10:58.299
Leave us. Don't come back.

11:01.412 --> 11:02.430
Romulus...

11:15.611 --> 11:16.727
Hail, Caesar.

11:16.799 --> 11:19.877
This is Aurelius,
of the Nova Invicta.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.993
He will command
your personal guard.

11:24.413 --> 11:25.946
May I see your sword, Commander?

11:31.640 --> 11:33.753
He must do everything
to protect me from harm,

11:33.824 --> 11:37.098
- must he not, Father?
- Indeed, he must.

11:37.165 --> 11:38.479
To the last breath.

11:38.547 --> 11:40.693
And do I have your word on that?

11:40.762 --> 11:43.194
You have his word.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.666
He is sworn to serve you.

11:45.741 --> 11:47.242
Is it so, Commander?

11:50.817 --> 11:51.769
Thank you.

11:52.714 --> 11:54.860
I only wanted to look at it.

12:01.449 --> 12:02.883
Open the gate.

12:04.438 --> 12:06.518
And this is also Caesar's will?

12:06.590 --> 12:10.051
You've been well rewarded.
Go back where you came from.

12:10.123 --> 12:14.514
My crime is putting new ideas
into a young head,

12:14.588 --> 12:16.088
teaching a lad to think for himself.

12:16.162 --> 12:17.629
This lad is our emperor.

12:18.604 --> 12:21.999
Which do you serve:
Caesar or your own ideas?

12:22.073 --> 12:24.898
"A wise man never asks
what another man serves...

12:24.964 --> 12:27.275
...for only his actions
will speak the true answer. "

12:27.341 --> 12:29.771
You've read your Seneca.

12:29.845 --> 12:31.927
I find poets as dangerous
as philosophers.

12:34.119 --> 12:35.071
And you...

12:36.175 --> 12:37.742
Where did you get this?

12:39.836 --> 12:41.435
A long time ago...

12:42.407 --> 12:43.721
in another land.

12:46.229 --> 12:48.507
...from a man who loved
only power.

12:52.428 --> 12:54.444
So you're an adventurer, as well.

12:55.288 --> 12:58.200
If I see you again in Rome,
it'll be on the point of my sword.

12:58.274 --> 13:00.105
Take care in the mist, Commander.

13:00.171 --> 13:03.051
It may hide what the gods
themselves dare not look upon.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.270
but who will guard
the guardians themselves?

13:14.336 --> 13:15.586
Nestor?

13:15.654 --> 13:17.121
Leave us.

13:21.025 --> 13:22.137
A senator.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.512
Well, these sit better on me
than armor ever did.

13:25.608 --> 13:27.272
How is it with you, Aurelius?

13:27.342 --> 13:29.390
Oh, a little older... no wiser.

13:29.462 --> 13:30.995
After all these years?

13:31.069 --> 13:32.963
Did you ever marry, have children?

13:33.028 --> 13:34.144
No.

13:35.051 --> 13:36.551
So what do you make of Rome?

13:36.626 --> 13:37.907
Different.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.669
Uneasy.

13:39.742 --> 13:43.203
If you're to guard our new Caesar,
keep your wits about you.

13:44.207 --> 13:47.964
And come see me. Friends are
a rare commodity these days.

13:48.029 --> 13:50.047
I will.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.543
The Goths!
They've betrayed us!

14:21.474 --> 14:22.656
You! To the wall!

14:24.525 --> 14:25.806
Commander!

14:26.678 --> 14:28.473
Prepare to fire!

14:29.031 --> 14:30.747
Aurelius!

14:30.817 --> 14:31.999
Down!

14:35.050 --> 14:37.932
Defend the Emperor!

14:38.990 --> 14:41.816
Get back, behind! Go! Go!

14:46.897 --> 14:48.728
Form wall!

14:57.078 --> 14:59.940
Over this way!

15:01.647 --> 15:03.929
Get back, boy!

15:21.066 --> 15:23.985
Yah!

15:41.984 --> 15:42.932
Ugh!

15:42.933 --> 15:44.913
Father!

15:46.056 --> 15:48.903
Odoacer wants the boy alive!

15:49.971 --> 15:53.200
I'll do my best.

16:06.962 --> 16:08.956
Save yourself.

16:12.537 --> 16:14.022
Yah.

16:37.971 --> 16:38.967
Aah!

18:00.217 --> 18:03.973
King, the emissary
from Constantinople.

18:04.038 --> 18:05.736
Welcome, Excellency.

18:05.806 --> 18:08.598
The city is ours.

18:09.692 --> 18:11.522
I ask that your empire recognize me

18:11.589 --> 18:14.151
as the sole ruler of Rome
and all her dominions.

18:14.222 --> 18:17.267
My emperor is in Constantinople.

18:18.109 --> 18:20.573
I am his eyes and his ears,

18:20.646 --> 18:22.694
but I cannot speak
on his behalf.

18:22.766 --> 18:24.847
Then go and seek his word.

18:35.583 --> 18:36.534
Master!

18:39.310 --> 18:40.974
Aurelius! Fetch water.

18:41.847 --> 18:45.224
The boy, Caesar-
is he alive?

18:45.298 --> 18:46.930
I couldn't find him.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.803
His mother and father were killed,
as were my men.

18:54.871 --> 18:56.152
How did this happen?

18:56.221 --> 18:58.881
Some of your men survived,
that I do know.

18:59.818 --> 19:01.384
Vatrenus was taken prisoner.

19:01.456 --> 19:02.868
There may be others with him, but...

19:03.865 --> 19:05.728
they're to be executed
as an example

19:05.794 --> 19:07.710
to those who would
stand against Odoacer.

19:23.624 --> 19:24.582
Come to me.

19:39.889 --> 19:42.803
Is it for you that
so many people have died?

19:44.193 --> 19:45.541
Such an innocent face.

19:45.607 --> 19:48.553
The blood of the Caesars
flows in his veins.

19:48.628 --> 19:51.989
Old Wulfila here
thinks that I should fear you.

19:53.155 --> 19:54.371
Is this true?

19:54.441 --> 19:57.967
He is the last of the bloodline.
End it now!

19:58.038 --> 19:59.671
Old Rome will die, and we rule!

19:59.741 --> 20:00.825
We?

20:02.022 --> 20:03.271
We rule?

20:04.592 --> 20:06.224
Take care, Wulfila.

20:06.294 --> 20:09.053
Sometimes your tongue
runs ahead of your brain.

20:19.368 --> 20:20.901
What do you say, boy?

20:22.837 --> 20:24.118
Should I be afraid of you?

20:26.082 --> 20:27.812
Why is Caesar treated so?

20:28.781 --> 20:30.510
Why is Caesar treated so...

20:38.578 --> 20:39.892
Perhaps Wulfila's right.

20:41.179 --> 20:43.611
Perhaps I should
end this here, right now.

20:48.568 --> 20:50.265
Can you see yourself?

20:51.202 --> 20:52.931
Can you see your face?

20:55.218 --> 20:56.367
What do you see?

20:56.439 --> 20:58.004
Do you see a boy?

21:00.293 --> 21:02.023
Or do you see a Caesar?

21:04.147 --> 21:05.527
I see...

21:05.593 --> 21:06.545
Tell me.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.433
I see a Caesar.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.295
I am Caesar.

21:20.047 --> 21:21.615
Wrong answer.

21:21.687 --> 21:23.034
Take him away.
Cut his head off.

21:24.353 --> 21:27.715
That will be
a grave error, Lord Odoacer.

21:28.497 --> 21:29.646
Who are you?

21:29.717 --> 21:33.376
You kill the boy,
you make a martyr of him,

21:33.443 --> 21:35.239
and Caesar's ghost
will haunt you ever after.

21:35.307 --> 21:36.555
Is that so?

21:36.623 --> 21:38.190
- Read the signs.
- What signs?

21:38.262 --> 21:39.696
An omen.

21:39.772 --> 21:42.049
Do not mistake it, Odoacer.

21:43.626 --> 21:45.421
If you hear one thing,
then hear this.

21:45.490 --> 21:48.436
What now happens in this room
will echo across an empire.

21:48.509 --> 21:49.977
A city may be won by blood.

21:52.524 --> 21:54.222
It takes a man of vision to rule.

21:54.292 --> 21:55.988
All empires are built on blood.

21:56.058 --> 21:57.109
People will judge you.

21:57.182 --> 22:00.808
The people will thank the gods
that they survived

22:00.876 --> 22:02.508
and serve their new master.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.759
Now, I asked. Who are you?

22:04.827 --> 22:08.189
Will they respect a leader
who's so afraid of a Roman child

22:08.265 --> 22:09.764
he had to butcher him?

22:16.007 --> 22:19.052
Perhaps the boy is more use to us
alive than dead.

22:19.989 --> 22:23.067
Do you want to look a fool?
Kill them both!

22:23.137 --> 22:24.418
Fool!

22:25.739 --> 22:31.292
Your best hope for the future,
Lord Wulfila, lies in silence!

22:33.546 --> 22:34.662
Give me your hand.

22:59.468 --> 23:02.097
Now, I ask, who are you?

23:02.167 --> 23:03.382
I'm known by many names.

23:03.451 --> 23:04.403
Like a thief.

23:04.479 --> 23:06.593
Here I'm called Ambrosinus.

23:22.263 --> 23:24.924
The boy will be taken
to the island fortress at Capri.

23:24.994 --> 23:28.038
You-you will be his prison guard.

23:28.109 --> 23:29.708
That's your reward.

23:29.779 --> 23:32.026
No harm comes to him
unless I say so.

23:32.093 --> 23:35.817
Not a hair on his head,
you understand me?

23:40.091 --> 23:41.822
And take this one, too.

23:42.789 --> 23:43.741
I don't trust him.

23:49.921 --> 23:51.552
Someone's here.

23:51.623 --> 23:52.707
Where?

23:59.526 --> 24:00.642
Please.

24:00.714 --> 24:02.663
Wait, Aurelius, I know this man.

24:02.737 --> 24:04.633
He speaks for the Eastern Empire.

24:04.698 --> 24:05.650
Is the boy alive?

24:05.725 --> 24:07.072
I saw him in chains.

24:07.138 --> 24:08.705
They're taking him to Capri.

24:08.777 --> 24:10.956
I'll find him,
bring him back.

24:11.025 --> 24:13.424
From Capri?
That's impossible.

24:13.499 --> 24:15.843
- It's an island, a natural fortress.
- I'll need my men.

24:15.908 --> 24:18.120
We've long been allies, Senator.

24:19.474 --> 24:20.623
Free your Caesar.

24:20.695 --> 24:24.220
My emperor will give him sanctuary
until it is safe for him to return to Rome.

24:40.575 --> 24:42.622
We meet at Fano in six days,
on the beach.

24:42.695 --> 24:45.192
If you bring back the boy,
there'll be a boat to take us east.

24:47.738 --> 24:49.402
Six days, then.

24:49.472 --> 24:50.939
- To the last breath.
- To the last breath.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.475
What's this?

24:55.543 --> 24:58.424
One of the ambassador's guards.
You'll need help to free your men.

24:58.499 --> 25:00.809
These people are our allies.
Use them.

25:07.044 --> 25:08.424
Follow me.

25:16.777 --> 25:19.856
Act as my prisoner.
When I give the signal, try to escape.

25:19.926 --> 25:21.787
You understand
what I've told you, yes?

25:23.715 --> 25:25.479
Then do as I've said
and nothing more.

25:34.091 --> 25:35.044
Uhn!

25:37.272 --> 25:38.804
Him first.

25:41.704 --> 25:43.784
Stop!

25:43.856 --> 25:44.842
Another prisoner.

25:48.418 --> 25:51.276
I'm to take this one's head
back to Rome,

25:51.342 --> 25:53.356
an assassin sent
to kill Lord Odoacer.

25:54.907 --> 25:55.858
Go.

25:57.284 --> 25:58.783
Uhn! Aah!

26:01.396 --> 26:02.929
Get him!

26:34.321 --> 26:35.406
Uhn!

26:48.488 --> 26:49.572
Ambrosinus...

26:51.057 --> 26:52.755
I want to be with them.

26:52.824 --> 26:55.102
I want to be with
my mother and father.

26:55.170 --> 26:56.286
You are with them.

26:57.001 --> 26:58.665
They live on in your heart.

27:00.951 --> 27:01.970
You cannot see them,

27:02.043 --> 27:04.989
but it's as if you're in one room
and they're in the next.

27:05.866 --> 27:07.761
I should have died, too.

27:07.825 --> 27:08.877
Not your destiny.

27:08.951 --> 27:10.385
I have no destiny.

27:10.460 --> 27:13.789
Every living creature
has a destiny, be sure of it.

27:14.861 --> 27:18.102
but when the pathway gets dark
and it's difficult to see the way...

27:20.129 --> 27:21.082
Well...

27:22.249 --> 27:23.781
that's why you have me...

27:25.141 --> 27:26.422
for all that I'm worth.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.176
Dumb bird. Forgot to feed it.

27:30.247 --> 27:32.777
Pugie. Pugie!

27:34.198 --> 27:35.316
I knew it.

27:36.897 --> 27:38.211
I knew it was a trick!

27:38.278 --> 27:39.658
Shh.

27:58.612 --> 28:00.144
Is this our destiny,

28:00.217 --> 28:02.847
to be prisoners here
for the rest of our lives?

28:03.592 --> 28:05.124
Have faith.

28:05.197 --> 28:07.507
There is a purpose behind all things.

28:21.483 --> 28:23.914
Where is he now?

29:20.810 --> 29:22.508
No sign of the Goths.

29:23.702 --> 29:26.012
but we should stay close to the river.

29:26.079 --> 29:27.677
The river, yes.

29:27.749 --> 29:29.095
They'll have scouts all the way.

29:31.250 --> 29:32.629
- Agreed, so we-
- Mira.

29:32.695 --> 29:33.647
Yes.

29:36.519 --> 29:37.471
What?

29:37.547 --> 29:40.208
My name. Mira.

29:51.296 --> 29:52.412
There's your boat.

29:52.484 --> 29:53.896
How d'you want to do this?

29:53.961 --> 29:56.008
If we all go down there,
we'll scare him off.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.647
He'll be gone before we get there.

30:07.003 --> 30:07.989
Wait here.

30:13.909 --> 30:15.508
He's a woman.

30:39.575 --> 30:40.528
Uhn!

30:43.977 --> 30:47.055
This fortress
was built as a palace

30:47.125 --> 30:50.070
by the great emperor Tiberius,
who, it is written,

30:50.143 --> 30:52.421
was a man of great dignity
and bearing-

30:52.489 --> 30:54.405
both of which you've inherited.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.627
So my ancestors built my prison.

30:58.754 --> 31:00.166
A prison it is.

31:07.940 --> 31:09.188
You thirsty, boy, hmm?

31:09.256 --> 31:10.757
Go on, drink.

31:11.859 --> 31:12.811
Mm?

31:12.887 --> 31:14.519
Drink.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.409
You dare insult me, boy! Huh!?

31:18.476 --> 31:20.426
It is a long way down, no?

31:20.500 --> 31:22.514
How many fingers
will it take you to learn

31:22.588 --> 31:25.184
your fate lies in the palm
of this child's hand,

31:25.255 --> 31:27.171
as sure as Odoacer
is your master.

31:27.246 --> 31:29.458
Throw this boy to the rocks,
you will follow.

31:32.835 --> 31:35.814
When the time comes, boy,

31:35.886 --> 31:39.895
I will send you to join
your mother and your father.

31:44.431 --> 31:45.515
You.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.534
Odoacer said nothing of you.

31:49.634 --> 31:50.916
String him up!

31:55.225 --> 31:56.176
Hold.

31:59.722 --> 32:01.452
What is this?

32:02.323 --> 32:04.119
Are you some kind of priest?

32:04.186 --> 32:05.468
A sorcerer?

32:05.537 --> 32:08.165
Just a seeker after the truth.

32:08.235 --> 32:10.578
You would never understand.

32:10.644 --> 32:11.892
Put him up.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.341
How long is it to climb to the top?

32:28.407 --> 32:31.003
An hour. Faster coming down.

32:31.073 --> 32:33.604
Take up all the wood
we can spare. And rope.

32:33.676 --> 32:34.760
You stay on the boat.

32:36.149 --> 32:37.682
- You may need me.
- No.

32:46.783 --> 32:48.962
The pentangle!

32:49.898 --> 32:51.848
Of course, of course, of course!

32:51.922 --> 32:53.750
This is the place.

32:54.941 --> 32:58.819
The sword!
Tiberius must have brought it here.

32:58.893 --> 33:01.105
And the boy will find it!

33:01.944 --> 33:03.226
Romulus!

33:03.293 --> 33:04.705
Ambrosinus?

33:04.771 --> 33:06.183
Go to the temple.

33:06.248 --> 33:08.494
Look for your ancestor,
Julius Caesar.

33:08.561 --> 33:10.608
There is something he guards for you.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.938
Look under the gaze of Caesar!

33:19.258 --> 33:21.918
Of course,
of course, of course.

33:31.433 --> 33:33.579
Under the gaze of Caesar.

34:14.922 --> 34:16.587
I told you to stay on the boat.

34:17.652 --> 34:19.286
You will need my help.

34:22.889 --> 34:25.681
You know what happens to a soldier
of mine who disobeys an order?

34:26.969 --> 34:28.731
Your men are too slow.

34:29.956 --> 34:31.523
Stay out of sight.

34:34.293 --> 34:35.989
I don't see why you take the risk.

34:36.927 --> 34:38.426
I serve my emperor.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.641
He's your country's ally,
so I am with you.

34:42.708 --> 34:44.438
Where did you learn to fight?

34:45.504 --> 34:49.195
I come from Kerala,
in the south of India.

34:49.262 --> 34:51.475
We were taught to fight
like our forefathers.

34:52.089 --> 34:53.556
It is called Kalarippayattu.

34:54.434 --> 34:57.577
When I was 14,
I was at the 7th level.

34:57.646 --> 34:59.179
Out of how many?

35:00.088 --> 35:01.074
Seven.

35:01.148 --> 35:03.613
Shall we talk all day, or climb?

35:36.643 --> 35:38.438
Julius Caesar.

35:52.994 --> 35:54.824
"One edge to defend;

35:54.889 --> 35:56.170
"one to defeat.

35:57.620 --> 36:02.494
In Britannia was I forged to fit the hand
of he who was destined to rule. "

36:18.820 --> 36:20.737
I have work for you.

37:07.390 --> 37:08.343
Oh!

37:39.096 --> 37:41.593
Uhn! Uh!

38:20.419 --> 38:21.668
Give me that sword.

38:22.764 --> 38:24.113
Give it to me!

38:31.024 --> 38:32.206
Uhn.

38:39.161 --> 38:42.403
- You.
- Only two to rescue an emperor?

38:42.470 --> 38:43.685
More are coming.

38:43.754 --> 38:45.584
Caesar!
- The temple!

38:52.846 --> 38:54.061
Yours.

39:58.281 --> 39:59.813
Uhn!

41:15.664 --> 41:17.196
Uagh!

41:36.051 --> 41:37.168
Tsk.

41:46.195 --> 41:47.542
Romulus!

41:50.256 --> 41:51.756
You found the sword, boy?

41:52.665 --> 41:53.880
Save the emperor!

41:54.496 --> 41:55.931
Where's Caesar's sword?

41:57.612 --> 41:58.729
It's this way!

42:02.881 --> 42:04.381
Get them away.

42:04.551 --> 42:06.051
Get them away!

42:21.672 --> 42:23.819
I got it.

42:24.499 --> 42:25.966
Batiatus.

42:27.647 --> 42:29.377
Yours.

42:34.939 --> 42:36.438
- Go!
- This way.

42:40.079 --> 42:41.360
Get the boy away.

43:16.313 --> 43:17.747
Roman.

43:43.104 --> 43:44.450
Where's the boy?

43:44.517 --> 43:45.930
Safe below with the others.

44:17.442 --> 44:20.421
You were right, Batiatus.
It is quicker on the way down.

44:39.897 --> 44:41.880
"One edge to defend;
one to defeat.

44:41.953 --> 44:43.815
"In Britannia was I forged

44:43.880 --> 44:48.206
to fit the hand of he
who is destined to rule. "

44:49.405 --> 44:51.168
Caesar's sword.

44:52.296 --> 44:54.540
That is why it had such power.

44:57.115 --> 44:58.714
Britannia.

45:01.194 --> 45:02.574
Gather the men!

45:04.760 --> 45:06.326
Made for a conqueror...

45:07.458 --> 45:08.871
Julius Caesar.

45:14.108 --> 45:17.283
Caius Julius Caesar
ensis caliburnis.

45:18.894 --> 45:20.273
Feel the weight.

45:47.419 --> 45:49.818
This sword carries a prophecy.

45:50.856 --> 45:52.357
Did you see anything...

45:52.431 --> 45:53.613
anything written?

45:56.575 --> 45:58.852
Then you know all you need to know.

46:00.364 --> 46:01.415
Take it.

46:03.578 --> 46:04.629
It's yours.

46:35.732 --> 46:37.495
Welcome, Caesar!

46:38.301 --> 46:39.352
Aurelius.

46:39.425 --> 46:40.773
All of you.

46:42.991 --> 46:45.302
There is food and drink inside the tent.

46:46.526 --> 46:47.774
We need to talk.

46:47.842 --> 46:48.828
Alone.

46:50.572 --> 46:52.072
You're safe now.

46:52.147 --> 46:54.194
From here you'll be taken
to the Eastern Empire,

46:54.267 --> 46:55.931
to Constantinople.

46:57.866 --> 46:59.628
You'll have sanctuary.

47:31.561 --> 47:32.513
Uh!

47:35.577 --> 47:38.588
The ambassador has heard
from Constantinople.

47:38.661 --> 47:41.126
The emperor will not give
sanctuary to the boy.

47:42.644 --> 47:45.239
He will not oppose Odoacer
nor offend him.

47:45.309 --> 47:46.843
Everything has changed.

47:46.917 --> 47:50.508
The day after you left, the garrison of Rome
swore allegiance to Odoacer.

47:50.577 --> 47:52.954
Now the rest of the commanders
have declared.

47:53.020 --> 47:54.432
They all stand with the Goth.

47:55.396 --> 47:57.127
There must be others
still in the field.

47:58.256 --> 47:59.241
What about the Ninth?

47:59.316 --> 48:01.812
The Ninth Legion,
they're far to the north in Britannia.

48:01.884 --> 48:04.032
For all we know, Britannia
has crumbled into the sea.

48:04.102 --> 48:05.932
Then we must move fast.

48:05.997 --> 48:07.015
Can you get me men?

48:07.090 --> 48:11.196
Yes, you can keep your rank,
command a new army.

48:11.265 --> 48:12.611
Good. Then do it now.

48:12.679 --> 48:14.541
We'll drive out the invaders
if I can have 5,000 men-

48:14.607 --> 48:16.435
Not for that, Aurelius, I can't do that.

48:16.501 --> 48:19.130
Why not? What is it with you, Nestor?

48:20.003 --> 48:23.244
- Odoacer isn't just a barbarian.
- Is he not?

48:23.311 --> 48:26.520
No, he's become a politician,
and a very astute one.

48:26.588 --> 48:29.051
Now he has the Senate on his side.

48:29.125 --> 48:30.340
How many of the Senate?

48:30.411 --> 48:33.806
We have to see things as they are.

48:34.643 --> 48:36.209
You're with them.

48:38.175 --> 48:41.504
In time, perhaps,
we can challenge Odoacer, not now.

48:43.733 --> 48:48.541
So let's say you give me
this army, Senator.

48:48.616 --> 48:50.511
What will you ask for in return?

48:51.635 --> 48:52.587
The boy.

48:52.663 --> 48:54.360
You mean Caesar?

48:54.429 --> 48:56.927
Caesar is a word from the past.

48:56.999 --> 48:58.412
There is no Caesar.

49:03.939 --> 49:05.570
Prepare the horses.

49:07.343 --> 49:08.329
Where is the boat?

49:10.652 --> 49:12.185
I said prepare the horses.

49:14.540 --> 49:17.300
Where is the boat to take
the emperor to Constantinople?

49:21.862 --> 49:23.429
I gave you an order. What was it?

49:26.264 --> 49:28.246
Prepare the horses.

49:28.320 --> 49:29.667
Do it.

49:39.756 --> 49:41.453
You are a soldier, Aurelius.

49:41.523 --> 49:43.537
Leave the politics to me.

49:44.831 --> 49:47.558
This is an order.
Give up the boy.

49:48.588 --> 49:50.571
Without the emperor,
there is no Rome.

49:50.645 --> 49:53.657
Then you will run like a dog
until they hunt you down.

49:57.648 --> 49:58.600
Commander.

50:07.157 --> 50:08.569
- Get the boy.
- The boy!

50:08.634 --> 50:09.586
Get the boy!

50:12.039 --> 50:15.280
Stop, comrades!
We're all Romans!

50:15.347 --> 50:15.851
Uhn!

50:56.684 --> 50:58.666
Rrrah!

51:07.638 --> 51:08.689
Vatrenus.

51:32.148 --> 51:33.911
You don't understand, Aurelius.

51:33.979 --> 51:35.293
I had to do it.

51:39.793 --> 51:43.583
Aurelius, my friend,
if you ever loved me...

51:44.997 --> 51:46.080
For friendship.

51:46.154 --> 51:47.106
Uhh...

51:51.357 --> 51:52.606
Uhn!

52:02.472 --> 52:04.619
Now that the Eastern Empire
has gone over to the Goths,

52:04.688 --> 52:06.450
we have no refuge in Constantinople.

52:07.547 --> 52:08.982
Or here.

52:09.057 --> 52:10.339
Or in Germania.

52:11.820 --> 52:13.320
Where do we go, then?

52:16.992 --> 52:18.491
The Ninth Legion is in Britannia.

52:19.753 --> 52:22.732
It's the only way left to us,
north, to find them.

52:24.925 --> 52:26.525
This is not your fight.

52:27.656 --> 52:28.740
You're free to go.

52:30.193 --> 52:31.146
Go?

52:31.222 --> 52:33.335
Where should I go?

52:33.406 --> 52:35.518
I have broken my sacred oath,

52:35.590 --> 52:37.289
killed my commander.

52:38.225 --> 52:39.440
I'm like you.

52:39.510 --> 52:41.557
I have no country now.

52:44.488 --> 52:46.831
My road is your road.

52:46.897 --> 52:51.673
Commander, where we go
is not your decision to make.

52:52.551 --> 52:53.931
Caesar?

53:05.819 --> 53:08.315
We go north, to Britannia.

53:50.244 --> 53:53.103
beyond that peak is Gaul.

53:53.167 --> 53:56.047
by the next full moon,
we'll be in sight of Britannia.

54:24.261 --> 54:26.179
My beloved Britannia!

55:02.291 --> 55:04.438
Nobody alive,
Commander.

55:05.858 --> 55:07.357
There are horses here.

55:08.716 --> 55:12.691
After all these years,
it's still happening.

55:12.763 --> 55:14.110
Who could have done this?

55:14.177 --> 55:15.425
Only one man.

55:16.617 --> 55:18.314
His name is Vortgyn.

55:42.734 --> 55:44.080
What is this place?

55:44.147 --> 55:46.876
Hadrian's Wall,
the last fortress of the Empire.

55:46.942 --> 55:48.990
A monument to Roman law and order.

55:49.063 --> 55:50.858
The Ninth Legion.

55:50.925 --> 55:51.911
We've found them.

56:16.496 --> 56:17.547
Look.

56:17.620 --> 56:19.054
The dragon.

56:19.129 --> 56:20.925
They were here once.

56:20.992 --> 56:22.525
So where are the Ninth, old man?

56:23.561 --> 56:25.161
This is your country.

56:25.233 --> 56:26.613
What has happened here?

56:31.401 --> 56:33.481
This is where
the Empire ends, Demetrius.

56:34.740 --> 56:36.658
There's nothing left but this wall.

56:37.889 --> 56:40.265
We came all this way
for a legion of ghosts.

56:42.258 --> 56:43.857
Should've made our stand in Rome.

56:49.678 --> 56:51.408
It would have been hopeless.

56:51.476 --> 56:53.009
He must know.

56:53.083 --> 56:56.029
Ah, he's fought
hopeless battles before.

56:57.034 --> 56:58.952
And you have stood by him.

57:06.606 --> 57:07.888
Any time, anywhere.

57:29.446 --> 57:31.111
They look like farmers.

57:32.081 --> 57:33.032
Who are you?

57:33.107 --> 57:35.868
I'm Aurelianus Antonius
of the Nova Invicta.

57:35.935 --> 57:37.370
These are my men.

57:37.445 --> 57:38.912
I'm Kustennin.

57:38.986 --> 57:40.903
These are mine.

57:42.103 --> 57:44.567
I'm looking for the Ninth Legion
of the Roman Army.

57:45.346 --> 57:47.141
Why do you come so far for them?

57:48.303 --> 57:49.518
Rome has fallen.

57:51.579 --> 57:52.663
What happened here?

57:53.699 --> 57:55.648
The Dragon Legion is no more.

57:57.456 --> 58:00.315
They were more than 1,000 strong.
Who could have defeated them?

58:02.340 --> 58:04.684
Kustennin, where are
my countrymen?

58:04.749 --> 58:09.108
Commander, I am
Flavius Constantinus Marcellus,

58:09.182 --> 58:10.617
general of the Ninth Legion.

58:13.068 --> 58:14.986
Rome abandoned us.

58:15.061 --> 58:16.978
Some men left to fight in Gaul.

58:17.053 --> 58:19.549
Those with families stayed here.

58:20.393 --> 58:22.441
Now you see we live like Celts.

58:22.513 --> 58:24.374
We have a whole new generation.

58:24.440 --> 58:27.134
We saw villages destroyed,
people slaughtered.

58:27.203 --> 58:29.602
Vortgyn, King of Anglia.

58:29.677 --> 58:33.586
He's taken the southern kingdoms,
and now he wants to rule all Britannia.

58:35.105 --> 58:38.599
He's left us in peace so far.
We are no threat to him.

58:38.671 --> 58:42.363
And he knows we are
no ordinary farmers. Come.

58:52.579 --> 58:58.418
We bring greetings to Lord Vortgyn,
conqueror of the Anglian people,

58:58.492 --> 59:01.732
rightful ruler of Britannia.

59:08.288 --> 59:09.406
There is a boy.

59:10.505 --> 59:11.852
A boy?

59:11.918 --> 59:15.544
He carries a sword.
The sword carries a prophecy-

59:15.612 --> 59:18.174
"One edge to defend;
one to defeat.

59:18.246 --> 59:20.622
In Britannia was I forged
to fit the hand of-"

59:20.687 --> 59:23.119
"... he who is destined to rule. "

59:26.117 --> 59:28.066
You, uh, know of this.

59:28.140 --> 59:30.056
You say a boy has it?

59:30.131 --> 59:31.413
Where is this boy?

59:31.481 --> 59:32.980
Here, in Britannia.

59:33.054 --> 59:34.554
Oh!

59:35.624 --> 59:37.225
I've waited all my life for this.

59:39.865 --> 59:42.363
Lord Vortgyn, the sword belongs-

59:42.436 --> 59:45.863
To the hand of he
who is destined to rule!

59:47.873 --> 59:51.269
This... is the hand.

59:53.142 --> 59:57.282
Then I take the boy
and the man who travels with him.

59:58.859 --> 01:00:01.289
This man...

01:00:04.161 --> 01:00:05.956
Tell me about the man.

01:00:07.051 --> 01:00:08.551
He is the boy's teacher.

01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:09.775
Acts like a priest.

01:00:09.846 --> 01:00:13.472
He is not Roman,
maybe from Gaul or here, in Britannia.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.168
He has a scar here
in the shape of a sword.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:19.897
Like this?

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:22.372
The same.

01:00:27.031 --> 01:00:28.695
When I have the sword...

01:00:30.084 --> 01:00:32.482
I will make you a gift of the boy.

01:00:32.557 --> 01:00:33.991
And the man?

01:00:36.636 --> 01:00:39.011
The man is mine.

01:00:41.903 --> 01:00:46.142
This blade was forged
from a flaming stone

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:49.287
that fell to Earth from the stars.

01:00:49.357 --> 01:00:52.916
Who has ever seen such a thing
in the dark of the sky at night?

01:00:54.688 --> 01:00:56.122
Then you will know,
and you will know,

01:00:56.199 --> 01:00:57.667
and you will know,
and you will know,

01:00:57.741 --> 01:00:59.241
that what I tell you is true.

01:00:59.315 --> 01:01:01.975
The stone of fire that fell to Earth

01:01:02.044 --> 01:01:06.885
cooled in the ice of a mountain
and turned to iron.

01:01:06.959 --> 01:01:11.231
There it was found
by a master blacksmith, a Calybian.

01:01:11.297 --> 01:01:14.659
He hammered the metal in his furnace
for three days and three nights,

01:01:14.734 --> 01:01:16.814
hammering
in the white heat with no stop,

01:01:16.886 --> 01:01:19.317
no, not so much as to eat or drink.

01:01:21.479 --> 01:01:24.941
The cutting edge he tempered
in the blood of a lion,

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:28.321
and see here-
he carved the pentangle,

01:01:28.386 --> 01:01:31.978
a symbol of faith and truth,

01:01:32.048 --> 01:01:35.739
so whoever held this sword

01:01:35.806 --> 01:01:38.665
would have faith
and know that it would serve

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:42.256
one cause, and one cause only.

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:45.983
The truth.

01:01:46.857 --> 01:01:48.773
Would you
take up arms again?

01:01:49.683 --> 01:01:51.063
For the emperor?

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:55.809
We swore a sacred oath
to defend our emperor to the death,

01:01:55.883 --> 01:01:57.833
but to go against the Goth...

01:01:59.127 --> 01:02:00.824
It would take a miracle.

01:02:10.242 --> 01:02:11.709
It's so simple for them.

01:02:12.747 --> 01:02:15.474
They like each other,
and they're not afraid to show it.

01:02:21.485 --> 01:02:23.346
How do you see me, Aurelius?

01:02:26.753 --> 01:02:28.187
You're a fine warrior.

01:02:30.319 --> 01:02:33.046
You let your guard drop
occasionally, you're...

01:02:33.114 --> 01:02:34.165
careless, sometimes.

01:02:39.955 --> 01:02:41.488
Show me.

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:56.561
Is that all you see me as,
a warrior?

01:02:57.559 --> 01:02:58.906
You're a handsome woman
in your way.

01:03:02.762 --> 01:03:04.197
Such passion, Commander.

01:03:04.273 --> 01:03:06.288
You must have broken many hearts.

01:03:12.432 --> 01:03:13.746
You're getting slow.

01:03:13.812 --> 01:03:14.963
Must be age.

01:03:18.277 --> 01:03:20.906
You know, your attacks
are a little too predictable.

01:03:28.846 --> 01:03:31.793
So, where am I open?

01:03:32.573 --> 01:03:33.624
There.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.721
Not bad.

01:03:45.711 --> 01:03:47.179
Do you know this place?

01:03:47.253 --> 01:03:49.147
Once, yes, I knew it well.

01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:52.514
This was a sanctuary
for those whose lives

01:03:52.586 --> 01:03:54.984
were dedicated
to the secret of the sword.

01:03:55.059 --> 01:03:56.690
Did you live here, Ambrosinus?

01:03:58.496 --> 01:04:00.193
Here I was given this,

01:04:00.263 --> 01:04:01.927
by Vortgyn.

01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:06.557
Aah!

01:04:06.623 --> 01:04:08.222
Where is it?!

01:04:08.293 --> 01:04:11.086
He wanted the power
of the sword for himself...

01:04:12.437 --> 01:04:15.614
...but the secret could only
be given to a righteous man.

01:04:15.682 --> 01:04:18.211
That moment. so long ago.

01:04:18.283 --> 01:04:21.712
marked the path
of both our lives forever after.

01:04:22.621 --> 01:04:23.967
The pentangle.

01:04:24.932 --> 01:04:26.532
It's the same as on the sword.

01:04:27.471 --> 01:04:29.167
Remember the prophecy?

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:32.380
"In Britannia was I forged...

01:04:32.449 --> 01:04:35.243
to fit the hand of he
who was destined to rule. "

01:04:36.048 --> 01:04:38.906
I left Britannia in search
of the sword; I found you.

01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:42.857
I knew then that what was written
must come to pass.

01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:46.028
but I'm Caesar without an empire.

01:04:46.101 --> 01:04:48.118
How can I fulfill the prophecy?

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:50.524
Have I taught you nothing?

01:04:51.531 --> 01:04:53.229
Prophecy is an act of faith,

01:04:53.298 --> 01:04:55.312
and we are the keepers of the faith.

01:04:58.882 --> 01:05:00.383
What do you think, Aurelius?

01:05:01.485 --> 01:05:03.632
Would you bury your sword for this,

01:05:03.701 --> 01:05:09.189
to have a home,
keep cattle, grow fat?

01:05:12.245 --> 01:05:13.780
When it's over.

01:05:15.395 --> 01:05:16.829
Maybe then.

01:05:21.016 --> 01:05:22.515
I'm cold.

01:05:58.471 --> 01:05:59.817
Well, little one.

01:06:01.714 --> 01:06:03.992
I want you to...

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.822
go back to your people.

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.227
Carry a message for me.

01:06:09.297 --> 01:06:12.724
You have a friend
who comes from a distant land.

01:06:14.339 --> 01:06:15.773
They must give him up.

01:06:16.909 --> 01:06:17.993
Look.

01:06:32.777 --> 01:06:33.959
Ygraine?

01:06:44.149 --> 01:06:45.748
The blacksmith's family.

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:50.251
This is Vortgyn at work.

01:06:50.317 --> 01:06:52.847
- Oh, please, don't make them kill me!
- No, no, no.

01:06:52.919 --> 01:06:53.970
- They'll kill me.
- Shush, child.

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:56.671
- They won't kill you.
- Yes, they will. They'll kill us all.

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.854
Unless we give them...

01:07:02.267 --> 01:07:03.385
Him.

01:07:07.053 --> 01:07:08.104
Romulus?

01:07:09.879 --> 01:07:11.708
Lovely Romulus.

01:07:22.022 --> 01:07:26.348
The boy. He is the one.

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:29.724
He is Romulus Augustus Caesar.

01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:37.340
Why us, Aurelius?

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.939
Why did you come to us?

01:07:56.234 --> 01:08:01.523
I lost my wife and two sons today...

01:08:02.785 --> 01:08:03.903
and I want revenge...

01:08:06.191 --> 01:08:11.164
but the bitter truth is
if we stand against Vortgyn,

01:08:11.235 --> 01:08:13.151
many more will die,

01:08:13.225 --> 01:08:16.018
perhaps all of us and our families.

01:08:17.241 --> 01:08:19.223
That's not revenge; that's suicide.

01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:22.508
The boy should go,

01:08:22.573 --> 01:08:25.433
- and those who came with him.
It's not our fight.

01:08:26.716 --> 01:08:28.546
That's true, suicidal.

01:08:30.509 --> 01:08:31.658
Let us hear Aurelius.

01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:33.361
I will speak for him.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.410
Everything you have been told is true.

01:08:46.151 --> 01:08:47.531
I am Caesar.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:54.493
We came asking for your loyalty,
but Rome has not been loyal to you.

01:08:54.568 --> 01:08:57.743
Now, if it is the right path
and if it will save more lives,

01:08:57.813 --> 01:08:59.509
then I will surrender to Vortgyn.

01:09:04.591 --> 01:09:07.185
Whatever is decided here
will be my destiny.

01:09:07.256 --> 01:09:09.787
What are we doing?
This is our emperor!

01:09:09.859 --> 01:09:13.734
One day will decide this,
one final battle.

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:18.528
At dawn I leave for the fort with my men
to fight and defend from there.

01:09:18.595 --> 01:09:22.319
Those of you who will stand with us,
we welcome you as brothers.

01:09:23.286 --> 01:09:26.013
Those who will not,
we leave you also as brothers.

01:09:27.173 --> 01:09:28.640
I salute you all.

01:09:30.287 --> 01:09:33.234
Hail, Caesar.

01:09:40.696 --> 01:09:42.679
You kept your armor,
after all these years.

01:09:42.752 --> 01:09:45.127
Ten years of farming gives you
something worth fighting for.

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:50.296
Twenty as a legionary...
teaches you to be ready for the day.

01:09:50.365 --> 01:09:51.613
Good man.

01:09:57.044 --> 01:09:58.675
It was made for my brother.

01:09:58.746 --> 01:10:00.158
Doesn't he need it?

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:02.852
He's grown since then.

01:10:31.382 --> 01:10:33.462
If we all die tomorrow, Ambrosinus...

01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:35.968
what happens to the prophecy?

01:10:36.907 --> 01:10:41.180
Now is the test of our faith,
and we are the keepers of the faith.

01:10:44.263 --> 01:10:45.993
We keep the flame alive.

01:10:47.861 --> 01:10:51.135
What happens after
is not ours to know.

01:11:50.886 --> 01:11:52.934
If we don't live to see tomorrow...

01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:57.848
Nothing will ever part us.

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:00.868
Commander.

01:12:11.187 --> 01:12:13.203
A boy once took your sword.

01:12:17.323 --> 01:12:19.952
What if he now
offered you his in exchange?

01:12:21.596 --> 01:12:23.194
I would use it well...

01:12:24.101 --> 01:12:26.150
and salute the Caesar
to whom it belongs.

01:12:35.987 --> 01:12:37.235
You are Caesar...

01:12:38.492 --> 01:12:39.774
wherever you are.

01:12:41.769 --> 01:12:43.149
Always remember.

01:13:13.346 --> 01:13:14.463
My friends.

01:13:16.076 --> 01:13:18.156
We've all seen
many mornings like this one.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.408
Together we've watched the sun rise

01:13:20.478 --> 01:13:23.007
and not known if that day
would be our last.

01:13:23.079 --> 01:13:26.639
Some comrades I've seen
scarcely out of boyhood,

01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:28.406
trembling before their first battle.

01:13:28.475 --> 01:13:29.887
It was a cold morning, Commander.

01:13:29.952 --> 01:13:32.384
That it was, Demetrius.

01:13:32.459 --> 01:13:34.540
And you men of the Ninth Legion,

01:13:34.611 --> 01:13:36.024
all of us,

01:13:36.089 --> 01:13:38.334
together we
have fought all our lives

01:13:38.402 --> 01:13:40.482
for the empire
that our ancestors created

01:13:40.553 --> 01:13:44.112
and together we have watched
that empire crumble to dust.

01:13:47.332 --> 01:13:49.479
but with its fall
we have lost two friends...

01:13:51.122 --> 01:13:53.685
and I can tell you
that in the darkest moments,

01:13:53.757 --> 01:13:56.801
I came to believe that there
was nothing left to fight for,

01:13:56.871 --> 01:13:59.532
but I've been shown
through the wisdom of others

01:13:59.603 --> 01:14:01.979
that there is
one more battle to be waged

01:14:02.044 --> 01:14:06.818
against tyranny
and the slaughter of innocents.

01:14:06.895 --> 01:14:10.136
Let us defend to the last breath
this island of Britannia

01:14:10.204 --> 01:14:12.733
against those who would
tear out its heart and soul.

01:14:12.804 --> 01:14:15.236
And then those
who come after us will remember

01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:18.739
that there was such a thing
as a Roman soldier

01:14:18.812 --> 01:14:21.156
with a Roman sword
and a Roman heart!

01:14:21.221 --> 01:14:23.781
Hail, Caesar!

01:14:23.854 --> 01:14:25.104
Demetrius!

01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:27.989
Commander!

01:14:30.474 --> 01:14:31.853
Secure the gates!

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:45.398
How many?

01:14:45.474 --> 01:14:47.872
A thousand,
maybe more.

01:14:47.947 --> 01:14:49.579
Not as many as I thought.

01:14:51.545 --> 01:14:55.522
You two man the walls.
Tertius, command the archers.

01:14:58.548 --> 01:15:02.523
They're out front!
Man battery! Light pitches!

01:15:02.595 --> 01:15:04.008
Archers!

01:15:12.843 --> 01:15:14.091
Attack!

01:15:23.379 --> 01:15:25.011
Aim!

01:15:25.081 --> 01:15:26.582
Shoot!

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:36.640
Vortgyn, I give you...

01:15:36.711 --> 01:15:37.762
Fire!

01:15:42.107 --> 01:15:43.421
Aim!

01:15:43.905 --> 01:15:44.989
Shoot!

01:15:55.121 --> 01:15:56.238
Sorcerer.

01:15:56.309 --> 01:15:58.586
They have the sorcerer!

01:15:58.653 --> 01:15:59.968
Clear!

01:16:01.609 --> 01:16:03.021
That is no sorcerer.

01:16:03.087 --> 01:16:05.431
That is the keeper of the sword.

01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:19.207
Aah!

01:16:19.278 --> 01:16:20.657
Stay close to me.

01:16:25.572 --> 01:16:27.653
The gate won't hold.
Watch out!

01:16:43.176 --> 01:16:44.293
Uhn!

01:17:08.585 --> 01:17:10.480
- Aaah!
- Demetrius!

01:17:14.817 --> 01:17:16.482
Whoa!

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:22.684
Uhn!

01:17:30.236 --> 01:17:31.934
Yah!

01:17:32.774 --> 01:17:35.149
bring me Caesar's sword!

01:17:38.781 --> 01:17:40.096
Uhn!

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:43.723
Ow!

01:17:57.829 --> 01:17:59.110
Uhh!

01:18:27.255 --> 01:18:28.436
No!

01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:40.397
I thought-I thought I had...

01:18:40.469 --> 01:18:44.708
Too many, old friend.
We don't have a chance.

01:19:03.245 --> 01:19:04.428
They're coming.

01:19:22.646 --> 01:19:24.212
The Ninth.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.671
Aah!

01:19:37.295 --> 01:19:38.795
To the last breath.

01:19:42.016 --> 01:19:43.582
Archers, make wall!

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.012
Romulus?

01:21:48.687 --> 01:21:49.584
Romulus!

01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:05.548
After all you've done
to my country...

01:22:05.616 --> 01:22:08.047
my Britannia, burn in hell!

01:22:19.975 --> 01:22:20.994
behold!

01:22:24.761 --> 01:22:27.389
The tyrant, Vortgyn...

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:28.674
He's dead!

01:22:32.952 --> 01:22:35.296
Retreat! Fall back!

01:22:50.138 --> 01:22:51.190
Romulus!

01:22:52.354 --> 01:22:53.702
Romulus!

01:24:45.138 --> 01:24:46.420
That's for my mother.

01:24:49.249 --> 01:24:50.628
And my father.

01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:15.772
Aurelius?

01:25:19.954 --> 01:25:22.452
Aurelius, stay.

01:25:31.936 --> 01:25:33.699
Stay close.

01:25:43.051 --> 01:25:44.430
You fought like a dragon.

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:47.994
And you fought
like the son of a dragon.

01:26:00.558 --> 01:26:02.289
You once swore to defend me.

01:26:02.358 --> 01:26:05.117
Mm, to the last breath.

01:26:05.954 --> 01:26:07.817
Have I discharged you
from that oath?

01:26:10.356 --> 01:26:13.664
Then live, Aurelius Antonius.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.045
And all of you,
the last of my legions...

01:26:53.593 --> 01:26:55.289
we won a great victory today.

01:26:56.549 --> 01:26:58.662
And now I say...

01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:01.296
no more blood.

01:27:04.579 --> 01:27:05.893
No more war!

01:27:36.091 --> 01:27:40.616
And that was how the last of the Romans
found a home, here in Britannia,

01:27:40.686 --> 01:27:45.560
and how, after years of turmoil,
they brought peace to the land.

01:27:46.596 --> 01:27:49.453
What happened
to the commander, Aurelius?

01:27:49.519 --> 01:27:51.316
Oh, he lived.

01:27:51.383 --> 01:27:54.296
He took the warrior maiden Mira
for his wife.

01:27:54.370 --> 01:27:55.869
And Romulus, the boy?

01:27:55.943 --> 01:27:57.861
They raised him as their own son.

01:27:57.936 --> 01:27:59.600
He grew to be a wise ruler.

01:28:01.758 --> 01:28:03.324
He took a Celtic name,

01:28:03.396 --> 01:28:05.379
"son of a dragon. "

01:28:05.452 --> 01:28:06.798
Pendragon.

01:28:06.962 --> 01:28:09.427
Pendragon.
That's my father.

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:12.445
And you remember
the little girl, Ygraine?

01:28:12.518 --> 01:28:13.505
He married her.

01:28:13.579 --> 01:28:14.597
My mother?

01:28:15.602 --> 01:28:19.262
And Ambrosinus
took back his real name.

01:28:20.839 --> 01:28:21.825
Merlin.

01:28:21.899 --> 01:28:23.048
You?

01:28:23.119 --> 01:28:24.949
Merlin-it's just a story.

01:28:25.015 --> 01:28:26.997
You made it up. It's a legend.

01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:29.501
Arthur, Arthur, Arthur.

01:28:29.576 --> 01:28:31.176
Have I ever lied to you?

01:28:31.247 --> 01:28:32.681
Every day.

01:28:35.424 --> 01:28:36.442
Hmm.

01:28:41.108 --> 01:28:42.159
That's it.

01:28:42.232 --> 01:28:45.310
That's where the lost legion
made their stand.

01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:54.749
Great legends were made here.

01:28:54.824 --> 01:28:56.807
With you as the hero.

01:28:57.684 --> 01:28:58.867
Of course.

01:29:13.618 --> 01:29:15.447
We need heroes, don't we?
