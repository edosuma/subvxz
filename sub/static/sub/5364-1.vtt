00:43.600 --> 00:46.353
Maa-ax!

01:05.600 --> 01:07.716
Roxanne?

01:35.360 --> 01:37.316
What's wrong?

01:48.840 --> 01:52.355
- Agh! No!
- Look!

02:09.280 --> 02:11.032
Uh... Ahh!
Hello?

02:11.160 --> 02:13.720
- Ahem. Hello.
- Max, where the heck are you, man?

02:13.840 --> 02:15.910
- P.J.?
- You should've been here an hour ago.

02:16.040 --> 02:19.510
What? What are...
Hold on. Oh, no!

02:19.640 --> 02:21.870
Look, maybe we should just
call the whole thing off.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.436
No way, man.
It's now or never.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.597
You better get a move on.
I'll meet you at my locker.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.916
Ayuk!
Mornin', son!

02:32.040 --> 02:33.439
Dad!

02:33.560 --> 02:35.710
Oops!
I forgot.

02:35.840 --> 02:39.230
Ayuk! Mornin', son!

02:39.360 --> 02:42.113
Came to see if you had any...
dirty clothes.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.037
Well, there they are.
Help yourself.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.594
Max, I thought
we talked about this.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.632
Look, I'm sorry, Dad.
I- I'll take care of it later. Ow!

02:49.760 --> 02:51.955
- What's the big rush?
- I'm running late.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.356
- Ooh. I could drive ya
on my way to work.
- Uh, no. No, thanks.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.109
- I, uh, need the exercise.
- Aw, come on, Max. Huh?

02:59.240 --> 03:02.437
Dad!
No, don't do it!

03:02.560 --> 03:04.676
Don't...
No!

03:05.760 --> 03:08.479
Oh, Dad,
you ruined it.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.672
Sorry 'bout that.
Who was he, anyway?

03:11.800 --> 03:15.190
It's only Powerline, Dad.
The biggest rock star on the planet.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.393
Ooh, not bigger than
Xavier Cugat, the Mambo King.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.069
Everybody mambo!
# Boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom #

03:23.200 --> 03:25.668
- Dad, there's no time for this.
What if the neighbours see us?
- # Boom-boom-boom-boom #

03:25.800 --> 03:27.597
# Boom-boom-boom #

03:28.960 --> 03:33.397
Maxie, wait up!
You forgot your lunch.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.909
- Have a good day!
- Duh... Ah!

03:36.040 --> 03:37.951
Huh.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.878
# They've been laughin'
since I can remember #

03:41.000 --> 03:44.197
# But they're not
gonna laugh any more #

03:44.320 --> 03:47.551
# No more "Maxie the Geek"
No more "Goof of the Week" #

03:47.680 --> 03:50.592
# Like before #

03:50.720 --> 03:53.996
# No more algebra tests
'til September #

03:54.120 --> 03:56.873
# No more lookin'
at losers like him #

03:57.000 --> 04:00.390
- # No more havin' to cheat #
- # No more mystery meat #

04:00.520 --> 04:02.272
- # No more gym #
- # No more gym #

04:02.400 --> 04:04.118
- # No more gym #
- # No more gym #

04:04.240 --> 04:06.800
- # Gonna move to the mall #
- # Gonna live in the pool #

04:06.920 --> 04:10.913
- Oh!
- # Gonna talk to Roxanne
and not feel like a fool #

04:11.040 --> 04:13.793
# 'Cause after today
I'm gonna be cruisin' #

04:13.920 --> 04:17.151
# After today
she'll be mine #

04:17.279 --> 04:19.874
# After today
my brains'll be snoozin' #

04:20.000 --> 04:23.436
# If I don't faint I'll be fine #

04:23.560 --> 04:27.075
# I've got 40 more minutes
of home economics #

04:27.200 --> 04:30.397
- # Then down with the textbooks #
- # And up with the comics #

04:30.520 --> 04:33.478
# Just think of all
the time I've been losin' #

04:33.600 --> 04:36.831
# Finding the right thing
to say #

04:36.960 --> 04:40.270
# But things'll be goin'
my way after today #

04:40.400 --> 04:43.198
# She looked
right through me #

04:43.320 --> 04:46.869
# And who could
blame her #

04:47.000 --> 04:52.438
# I need a new me plus some positive
proof that I'm not just a goof #

04:52.560 --> 04:56.030
# And after today
I'm gonna be cruisin' #

04:56.160 --> 04:59.072
# No more pep rallies to cut #
Yuck!

04:59.200 --> 05:02.431
# After today
our brains'll be snoozin' #

05:02.560 --> 05:05.518
# I'm gonna sit
on my butt #

05:05.640 --> 05:08.916
# I've got less than an hour
And when this is ended #

05:09.040 --> 05:12.350
- # I'll either be famous #
- # Or you'll be suspended #

05:12.480 --> 05:15.438
# Just think of all the time
I've been losin' #

05:15.560 --> 05:18.472
# Waiting until
I could say #

05:18.600 --> 05:21.478
# Gonna be on my own
Kiss the parents goodbye #

05:21.600 --> 05:25.275
# Gonna party from now
'til the end of July #

05:25.400 --> 05:27.709
# Things'll be going
my way #

05:27.840 --> 05:30.912
# After today #

05:32.760 --> 05:38.995
# I wish that this was the day
after today ##

05:44.640 --> 05:47.279
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.073
I just, uh...

06:04.960 --> 06:07.599
I can't believe
I did that!

06:07.720 --> 06:10.837
Ah! She finally says
"hi" to me, and what do I do?

06:10.960 --> 06:14.748
I... choke!

06:14.880 --> 06:17.792
- Like a big spaz!
- Where have you been, buddy?

06:17.920 --> 06:20.878
Ah. Hi, Peej.
Did you get the camera?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.753
Look, Max, if my dad catches me
with this, he'll kill me!

06:23.880 --> 06:25.677
Are you sure
we gotta do this?

06:25.800 --> 06:27.597
It's my only chance, Peej.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.837
To Roxanne, I'm...
I'm just a nobody.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.951
But after today...

06:33.080 --> 06:34.911
Bobby!

06:36.720 --> 06:39.109
Wow, look!
All this is for us?

06:39.240 --> 06:43.392
Mmm, slurpage!

06:43.520 --> 06:45.351
Oh, this is gonna be
so great, man!

06:45.480 --> 06:48.199
Dah.
Need fund-age, bro.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.390
Oh, your fee.
Yeah, yeah. Right here.

06:50.520 --> 06:55.640
Cheddar!

06:55.760 --> 06:58.149
Cheddar whizzy!

07:03.600 --> 07:07.388
It's pretty scrumptious.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.910
Let's do it, ladies!

07:13.360 --> 07:16.352
As student body president,
I just wanna say like "yea"...

07:16.480 --> 07:19.278
- to all of us for a really neat year.
- Yo, Stacey!

07:19.400 --> 07:22.597
Talk to me, talk to me,
talk to me, baby!

07:22.720 --> 07:26.110
And also that I hope you can
all attend my totally amazing
end-of-school party...

07:26.240 --> 07:29.277
next Saturday to watch the Powerline
concert live on pay-per-view.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.996
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.396
And now, without further ado,
Principal Mazur.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.470
Thank you, Stacey.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.034
And good morning,
boys and girls.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.754
You know, every year
on the last day of school...

07:46.880 --> 07:50.316
I have several youngsters
approach me and say,

07:50.440 --> 07:55.070
"Principal Mazur, what can we do
to not waste our summer vacation?

07:55.240 --> 07:56.719
- We don't want to waste
our free time...

07:57.720 --> 07:59.836
Sleeping or visiting friends."

07:59.960 --> 08:03.236
Say, Roxanne, about Stacey's party.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.914
How you, uh...
How you doin' down there, Bobby?

08:11.040 --> 08:15.079
Don't give me that attitude, you guys.
I'm doin' it all for you.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.474
This is nuts. I don't know why
I let you guys talk me into this.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.115
If my dad finds out, he's gonna nuke
my entire existence.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.753
...of the element,
or...

08:29.080 --> 08:30.752
I hope this works.

08:30.880 --> 08:36.193
How about science
slumber parties? Wha...

08:42.080 --> 08:45.516
Wha...
Hey!

08:45.640 --> 08:48.234
I'm not gonna just...

08:51.840 --> 08:55.435
# Some people settle
for the typical things #

08:55.560 --> 08:58.632
# Livin' all their lives
waitin' in the wings #

08:58.760 --> 09:02.275
# It ain't a question of "if"
It's a matter of time #

09:02.400 --> 09:05.472
# Before I move
to the front of the line #

09:05.600 --> 09:08.592
# Once you're watchin'
every move that I make #

09:08.720 --> 09:13.032
# You gotta believe
that I got what it takes #

09:13.160 --> 09:16.516
# To stand out above the crowd #

09:16.640 --> 09:18.949
# Even if I've gotta
shout out loud #

09:19.080 --> 09:22.311
# 'Til mine is the only
face you'll see #

09:22.440 --> 09:26.558
# Gonna stand out
'til you notice me, yeah #

09:28.280 --> 09:32.034
A little smoke-ege!
Oou-ou-ou!

09:32.160 --> 09:35.232
# If I can make you stop and
take a look at me instead of just #

09:35.360 --> 09:38.318
# Walkin' by #

09:38.440 --> 09:41.750
# There's nothin' that I wouldn't
do if it was gettin' you to notice #

09:41.880 --> 09:44.792
# I'm alive #

09:44.920 --> 09:48.310
# All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance #

09:48.440 --> 09:52.035
# To prove I've got
whatever it takes #

09:52.160 --> 09:53.639
It's a piece of cake.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.320
# To stand out
above the crowd #

09:56.440 --> 09:59.432
Wow! Who's that guy?

09:59.560 --> 10:02.393
# 'Til mine is the only
face you'll see #

10:02.520 --> 10:05.478
# Gonna stand out... #

10:12.160 --> 10:15.072
Hey, it's the Goof boy!

10:15.200 --> 10:17.191
We're busted!

10:24.040 --> 10:26.759
Ayuk!
Come on, smile!

10:26.880 --> 10:28.677
Smiley-wiley!

10:31.520 --> 10:33.954
Oh, come on, Kimmie.
Gimme a big...

10:49.360 --> 10:51.590
Stop goofin' around!

10:51.720 --> 10:53.711
We got work to do!

10:53.840 --> 10:56.035
Okay, Kimmie,
back to Mommy now.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.878
You're such a cute
little girlie.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.753
Oh, come back and see me.

11:04.880 --> 11:08.839
Oh, you have
such a way with children.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.157
"You have such a way
with children"!

11:12.280 --> 11:14.919
Okay, now.
Who's next over here?

11:15.040 --> 11:18.271
Step aside, Goof.
Let a pro show you how it's done.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.790
Okay. Who's next over here?

11:21.920 --> 11:24.195
Ooh, hello, precious...

11:27.000 --> 11:28.797
You lucky woman.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.831
Now, now,
you come on here, honey.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.076
- It's picture time. Come on.
- Peekaboo!

11:33.200 --> 11:35.634
- She's so cute.
- Peekaboo!

11:37.080 --> 11:39.116
Gosh, Pete,
you sure are good with kids.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.152
Oh, yeah. Well, they love me.

11:42.280 --> 11:46.796
Ha-ha. Why P.J., he's been beggin' me
to take him on vacation this summer.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.672
Really?
Where ya goin'?

11:48.800 --> 11:51.633
Campin'! Nothing like
the great outdoors...

11:51.760 --> 11:55.275
to strengthen the bond
between a father and a son.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.233
Oh, Max'd never go
for anything like that.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.032
- Gimme, gimme.
- I don't know, Goof.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.596
Somethin's wrong when a kid won't
spend time with his parents.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.598
Well, for all you know,
he's runnin' around with some gang,

12:06.720 --> 12:11.077
- and stealin' stuff,
and causin' riots and...
- Whaaa! Gimme!

12:11.200 --> 12:12.792
Oh, Max is a good kid.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.195
He'd never get mixed up
in somethin' like that.

12:21.800 --> 12:26.351
I'm a failure. Complete loser.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.950
My one chance to impress Roxanne,
and I blew it.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.913
Uh-huh!
Max, look.

12:33.040 --> 12:37.158
It's the Leaning Tower
of Cheese-a. Huh.

12:39.760 --> 12:43.594
Oh, man! My dad
is gonna smash me like a bug.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.076
Hey, P.J., detention!
Ha-ha-ha!

12:47.200 --> 12:49.156
Robert Zimuruski.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.789
Okay. I'm comin'.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.515
Max, here.
Guard this with your life, dude.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.117
Hey, Maz-u-ur!

13:05.240 --> 13:07.037
What's up, bro?
All right.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.469
Then my parents' air conditioner
went on the fritz.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.239
I figured with all those kids
in my house, the place would be
like a sauna. So I freaked out.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.588
Then I thought, like, use it.
So my theme's gonna be,

13:14.640 --> 13:16.915
"Powerline Goes
Rain Forest."

13:17.040 --> 13:21.158
Too much?
Roxanne, are you listening?

13:22.440 --> 13:24.795
Oh!

13:24.920 --> 13:28.230
- Stacey, no! I don't wanna...
- Talk to him.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.918
A- Ahem!

13:31.040 --> 13:33.190
A- A-Ahem!
Hmm.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.151
Tap him.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.955
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay... really.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.557
Um, I liked
your dance.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.148
Yeah. Yeah?

13:57.280 --> 13:59.111
Yeah, it's from
Powerline's new video.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.276
I know. H-He's
totally a genius.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.311
Yeah. H-He's doing a concert
next week in L.A.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.749
Oh, yeah.
Stacey's showing it at her party.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.235
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.070
Um, uh,
Roxanne,

14:12.200 --> 14:16.432
I was, uh, sorta, kinda
thinkin' that maybe I'd, um,

14:16.560 --> 14:20.269
ask you to, uh, go with me,
that is to the... party.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.789
Of course if you don't want to,
I'd completely understand.

14:22.920 --> 14:28.153
Well, I was sorta, kind of
thinkin' that... I'd love to.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.679
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.074
- Good.
- Great.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.155
- Terrific.
- Wonderful.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.998
- All right.
- Okay.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.157
Come on, Roxanne. We don't want
to belabor the moment now, do we?

14:37.280 --> 14:39.032
Well, I'd better
be going.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.037
I'll, uh,
call you later.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.594
Okay.
Bye. Oh.

14:43.720 --> 14:47.554
Bye.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.070
See, that wasn't so bad.
I told you men were easy to deal with.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.316
Yes!
She said yes!

14:53.440 --> 14:55.476
Ya-ha-ha-hoo!

14:55.600 --> 14:59.559
Everybody mambo!
# Rum-bum-bum-bum-dah #

15:07.200 --> 15:10.431
Yeah! Dance with her!
Groove with her.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.038
- Miss Maple!
- Yes, sir?

15:14.160 --> 15:16.515
Get that boy's father
on the phone at once!

15:16.640 --> 15:18.596
Right away, sir!
Whoo!

15:18.720 --> 15:20.073
Hello.

15:20.200 --> 15:24.239
Ah, yes. Mr Goof,
this is Principal Mazur.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.079
I'm calling in regard
to your son Maximilian.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.668
Max? Oh, my gosh!
Is he hurt?

15:29.800 --> 15:32.473
No, Mr Goof.
He's in trouble!

15:32.600 --> 15:34.556
Trouble?
What kind of trouble?

15:34.680 --> 15:36.830
- Dressed like a gang member.
- Gang member?

15:36.960 --> 15:39.713
Your son caused
the entire student body...

15:39.840 --> 15:42.115
to break into
a riotous frenzy!

15:42.240 --> 15:45.516
- Riot? Couldn't be my...
- If I were you, Mr Goof,

15:45.640 --> 15:49.030
I'd seriously reevaluate the way
you're raising your child...

15:49.160 --> 15:51.879
before he ends up
in the electric chair!

15:52.000 --> 15:54.958
The electric chair?

15:57.960 --> 16:01.236
What am I gonna do?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.555
Blue light special on aisle three.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.672
Blue light special on aisle three.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.596
Lake Destiny.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.678
Okay, kiddo.
Now, smile!

16:29.800 --> 16:31.597
Lake Destiny, Idaho!

16:31.720 --> 16:34.109
- Lake who-did-ho?
- You were right, Pete.

16:34.240 --> 16:38.153
Nothin' like the great outdoors
to strengthen the bond
between father and son.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.999
- You said so yourself.
- Well, yeah, but...

16:41.120 --> 16:44.510
I'm goin' fishin'!
I'm goin' fishin' with my boy!

16:44.640 --> 16:49.919
Yeah. Okay, precious.
Gimme a big smi...

16:51.360 --> 16:55.239
Fishing! Fishing!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

16:57.480 --> 16:59.835
Cool concert, lad.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.270
- What?
- You wailed, bud!

17:03.400 --> 17:06.756
- Hey, Max, wicked dance.
- Thanks.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.075
Forget it, girl.
He's Roxanne's.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.589
Way to go, man!
I just heard about you and Roxanne.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.108
Oh, Pete!
Ow!

17:15.240 --> 17:18.277
See, see? I told you
our plan would work!

17:18.400 --> 17:21.311
- Max! Max! Max!
- Peej, knock it off. Come on. Shh.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.035
- Maximum! Maxi-mu-um!
- Max! Max!

17:25.160 --> 17:28.675
Max! Max!
Max! Max! Max!

17:28.800 --> 17:31.394
Max! Max! Max!
Yea!

17:31.520 --> 17:34.273
# All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance #

17:34.400 --> 17:37.790
# To prove I've got
whatever it takes #

17:37.920 --> 17:39.558
It's a piece of cake.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.911
# To stand out
above the crowd #

17:43.040 --> 17:45.918
# Even if I gotta
shout out loud #

17:46.040 --> 17:48.110
# 'Til mine is the only
face you'll see #

17:48.240 --> 17:52.518
# Gonna stand out
Stand out, heh #

17:52.640 --> 17:55.791
# Stand out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #

17:55.920 --> 17:58.195
# Stand out #

17:58.320 --> 18:01.676
# 'Til mine is the only
face you'll see #

18:01.800 --> 18:04.030
# Gonna stand out ##

18:04.160 --> 18:06.594
'Til you notice me.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.599
Goin' somewhere, Pop?

18:08.680 --> 18:12.275
- Sure are, pal-a-roony.
- Cool. Have a good time, Dad.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.709
If you're gonna be gone
more than a month, drop me a line.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.354
But, Max, this isn't
just my vacation.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.278
It's a vacation with me
and my best buddy.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.392
- Oh, Donald Duck?
- No, silly. With you!

18:27.800 --> 18:29.950
Are you okay, Maxie?

18:30.080 --> 18:32.071
Wh-What did you say?

18:32.200 --> 18:34.998
That's right!
A vacation, son!

18:35.120 --> 18:37.873
We'll spend some
real quality time together!

18:38.000 --> 18:39.797
I think I'm gonna
be sick.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.592
Hey, got a present
for ya!

18:41.720 --> 18:43.870
Dad, stop that!
What are you doing?

18:46.760 --> 18:48.432
You look just like I did
at your age.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.755
Please don't say that,
Dad.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.998
Wait! I saved the best
for last.

18:55.120 --> 18:58.715
It's been handed down
from Goof to Goof to Goof.

18:58.840 --> 19:00.956
And now,
it's yours, son.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.310
- A stick?
- No, silly.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.237
A fishin' pole!

19:05.360 --> 19:07.430
Fishing?
We're going fishing?

19:07.560 --> 19:10.393
Yep. Just like
my dad and me did.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.239
Two best buddies
fishin' on Lake Destiny.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.157
Away from it all!

19:15.280 --> 19:17.794
I don't wanna be
"away" from it all, Dad.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.717
I like "it all"!

19:19.840 --> 19:23.435
Look, Maxie, we're using
the same map me and my dad used.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.199
We'll take the same route,
and make the same stops...

19:26.320 --> 19:28.311
and see the same sights.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.716
- But that trip would take weeks, Dad!
- Exactly!

19:31.840 --> 19:34.718
- Gettin' there is half the fun.
- Put the map away, Dad.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.637
- It's not gonna happen. I'm tellin' ya...
- Be careful, son.

19:36.760 --> 19:40.196
You'll wrinkle my past.
Ayuk! And our future.

19:40.320 --> 19:44.029
What the map says, Max,
we will follow.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.469
That's very mystical
and everything, Dad,

19:46.600 --> 19:49.512
but, uh, seriously, there's this party
I have to go to, see?

19:49.640 --> 19:52.359
- And there's this girl...
- Oh, there'll be plenty of time
for parties when you're older.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.950
Why, when I was your age
I'd never even been invited to a party.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.719
- Look at me now!
- Great, Dad.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.070
- Hop in, Maxie.
- No!

20:04.160 --> 20:06.071
All right, then.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.317
Guess I'll just have to go...
all alone.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.192
That's all.

20:11.320 --> 20:15.359
Just sit in the boat...
all alone...

20:15.480 --> 20:17.277
and talk to myself.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.676
- All alone.
- I guess so.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.916
- Oh, come on! Hop in!
- No, Dad.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.270
- Just hop right in there.
- No.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.198
- Come on, Maxie. Go for it!
- Agh! No.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.754
Let's buckle you up!

20:30.880 --> 20:32.836
And we're ready
for takeoff!

20:35.120 --> 20:36.917
Set for adventure,
Maxie?

20:37.040 --> 20:39.508
Why are you doing this
to me, Dad?

20:39.640 --> 20:42.632
'Cause I don't want ya
to end up in the electric chair.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.035
Electric chair?
What are you...

20:45.160 --> 20:46.912
I'm not givin' up
on ya, son.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.996
Together, we're gonna
work this out.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.917
Work this out?
But, Dad!

20:51.040 --> 20:53.429
No buts about it,
Maxie boy.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.630
- Your ol' pop knows best.
- But...

20:59.160 --> 21:02.232
Goodbye, house.
Goodbye, mailbox.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.751
Goodbye,
pile of broken wood.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.997
Goodbye, hopes.
Goodbye, dreams.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.998
Goodbye, Roxanne.
Roxanne!

21:14.120 --> 21:16.759
Dad, I gotta stop somewhere first.
I have to talk to someone.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.553
- Well...
- Turn here!

21:19.680 --> 21:22.752
D- Dad, watch out!

21:22.880 --> 21:26.077
Stop here.
Here! Pull over!

21:26.200 --> 21:29.988
Now, make it quick, Maxie boy.
We gotta put some road behind us.

21:30.120 --> 21:35.433
You get and cancel your first date
in less than an hour.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.516
Must be some kind of lame-o record.

21:39.680 --> 21:42.114
Grrr.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.435
Hi. Is Roxanne home?

21:44.560 --> 21:45.913
Grrr.

21:46.040 --> 21:49.112
M-M-My name's Max.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.879
Does Roxanne live here?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.798
- Does she even live
on this block? Ha-ha.
- Wait!

21:54.920 --> 21:57.036
It's okay, Daddy.
Max is a friend from school.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.910
Go on. Go on.
Good Daddy.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.076
- Hey, Max.
- Hi, there.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.272
You wanna...
uh, have a seat?

22:08.400 --> 22:10.994
Hey. Uh, u-u-oh.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.590
- Grrr.
- Daddy!

22:15.720 --> 22:18.518
I promise, he'll be better behaved
when you pick me up for the party.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.598
Yeah, that's, uh,
sorta why I came by.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.517
I'm really looking
forward to it, Max.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.315
- Yeah. I was too.
- Was?

22:27.440 --> 22:30.159
You see, my dad's on this
stupid father-son kick and...

22:30.280 --> 22:32.919
Don't worry about it, Max.
It's just a dumb party.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.759
No, it's not. Roxanne,
I really wanted to go with you.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.235
- No, Max, I understand.
Really, it's okay.
- But my dad surprised me.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.157
- These things happen.
- I don't wanna go, but I have no choice.

22:40.280 --> 22:43.636
- I'm sure I can find someone else.
- Someone else?

22:43.760 --> 22:47.435
- I'll just talk to you later.
- Uh, uh, Roxanne!

22:47.560 --> 22:49.437
Uh, my dad is, uh...

22:49.560 --> 22:52.472
My dad's taking me
to the Powerline concert in L.A.

22:52.600 --> 22:56.559
Your dad's taking you clear across
the country just to see a concert?

22:56.680 --> 22:59.752
Uh, well, you see, uh,
my dad...

22:59.880 --> 23:02.394
uh, knew... knows,
knows Powerline.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.317
They used to play together
in a band!

23:04.440 --> 23:06.556
- Yeah!
- Come on, son!

23:06.680 --> 23:09.148
Let's get this show
on the road!

23:09.280 --> 23:11.077
Uh, ha!
Just a minute!

23:11.200 --> 23:14.272
You... party animal,
you.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.517
- You're really serious.
- Absolutely.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.437
So, uh,

23:22.560 --> 23:25.552
you aren't still thinkin'
of goin' with someone else, are you?

23:25.680 --> 23:28.592
- Well, I guess...
- Because I was hopin'...

23:28.720 --> 23:31.075
I could, uh,
wave to you onstage...

23:31.200 --> 23:33.794
when we join Powerline
for the final number.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.831
This is incredible.

23:35.960 --> 23:39.839
Well, I wouldn't miss
our date for anything that
wasn't incredible, Roxanne.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.035
Have a great time
at the concert, Max.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.720
I'll see you on TV!

23:47.840 --> 23:50.593
Ah. I'm in deep sludge.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.552
Day one.
Well, here we are,

24:02.680 --> 24:06.116
out on the open road,
retracin' the steps of my boyhood.

24:06.240 --> 24:09.471
And here's Maxie!

24:09.600 --> 24:12.068
Say hi, Max.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.272
- Well, how 'bout a wave?
- Not now, Dad.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.630
Ayuk! What a kidder!

24:25.800 --> 24:28.394
Fun games I used to play
with my dad.

24:28.520 --> 24:32.399
Road bingo. Twenty ques...
Aah! Hey, Maxie.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.431
Let's play a game.
You think of a name,

24:34.560 --> 24:36.232
and I'll try and guess
who it is.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.794
- Uh, man or woman?
- Oh, man.

24:38.920 --> 24:42.276
A man, huh?
Hmm, that's a toughie.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.709
Uh, let's see.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.637
- Walt Disney!
- Right.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.797
I'm good at this.
Now, uh, I'll think of one.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.195
Hmm.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.958
Oh! You wanna
sing a song, huh?

24:57.080 --> 25:00.470
Me and my dad used to sing
this one all the time.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.989
# High hopes #

25:03.120 --> 25:06.032
# He's got high hopes #

25:06.160 --> 25:09.470
# He's got high apple pie #

25:09.600 --> 25:11.875
# In the sky hopes #

25:15.760 --> 25:18.354
# Oops, there goes another... #

25:21.760 --> 25:23.591
# Oops, there goes... #

25:23.720 --> 25:26.154
# Oops, there goes... #

25:26.280 --> 25:28.919
# Oops... #

25:33.600 --> 25:37.832
Oh, g-great, Dad.
Now we don't have any music!

25:37.960 --> 25:39.837
Oh, Maxie.
It's not so bad.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.837
We'll just have
to entertain ourselves!

25:55.360 --> 25:57.271
Putt-putt-poof!

25:57.400 --> 25:59.470
Putt-putt-poof!

25:59.600 --> 26:01.591
- Ping-ping-ping.
- Putt-putt-poof!

26:01.720 --> 26:05.759
Ping-ping-ping. Ping-ping-ping.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.677
- Ping-ping-ping.
- Putt-putt-poof.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.837
- Ping-ping-ping.
- Putt-putt-poof.

26:14.560 --> 26:18.872
# Do ya need a break
from modern livin' #

26:19.000 --> 26:23.516
# Do you long to shed
your weary load #

26:23.640 --> 26:25.471
# If your nerves are raw
and your brain is fried #

26:25.600 --> 26:28.512
# Just grab a friend
and take a ride together #

26:28.640 --> 26:31.393
# On the open road #

26:31.520 --> 26:33.476
Come on, Maxie!

26:33.600 --> 26:37.479
# All in all
I'd rather have detention #

26:37.600 --> 26:40.717
# All in all
I'd rather eat a toad #

26:40.840 --> 26:42.432
Yuck!

26:42.560 --> 26:44.835
# Old man drives like
such a klutz #

26:44.960 --> 26:47.394
# That I'm about to hurl my guts
directly #

26:47.520 --> 26:50.512
# Upon the open road #

26:50.640 --> 26:54.792
# There's nothin' can upset me
'cause now we're on our way #

26:54.920 --> 26:59.038
# Our trusty map will guide us
straight and true #

26:59.160 --> 27:02.470
# Roxanne, please don't forget me
I will return someday #

27:02.600 --> 27:07.196
# Though I may be
in traction when I do #

27:07.320 --> 27:10.551
- # Me and Max relaxin'
like the old days #
- # This is worse #

27:10.680 --> 27:13.797
- # Than dragon breath and acne #
- # In a buddy-buddy kind of way #

27:13.920 --> 27:16.354
# I'm so mad I think
I may explode #

27:16.480 --> 27:19.995
- # When I see that highway I could cry #
- # That's funny, so could I #

27:20.120 --> 27:23.715
# Just bein' out on the open road #

27:30.400 --> 27:33.915
# Howdy, boys
Is this the way to Nashville #

27:34.040 --> 27:35.837
Watch it, Mac!

27:35.960 --> 27:39.032
# Or you'll
be gettin' towed #

27:39.160 --> 27:41.151
# I'm in no hurry
to arrive #

27:41.280 --> 27:43.430
# 'Cause I'll be turnin'
sixty-five #

27:43.560 --> 27:46.711
# The next time I sees
the open road #

27:49.960 --> 27:53.555
- # Just a week of rest and relaxation #
- Yeah!

27:53.680 --> 27:56.558
# And the odd
romantic episode #

27:56.680 --> 27:58.193
Very odd!

27:58.320 --> 28:00.231
# And it's Califor-ni-a
or bust #

28:00.360 --> 28:02.157
# Look out, you dirtbags
Eat my dust #

28:02.280 --> 28:06.478
# From now on
I own the open road #

28:06.600 --> 28:10.593
# It's me and little Maxie
My pip-squeak pioneer #

28:10.720 --> 28:13.393
# They're partners forever
Westward ho #

28:13.520 --> 28:15.033
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!

28:15.160 --> 28:18.994
# Could someone call a taxi
and get me outta here #

28:19.120 --> 28:23.113
# To Beverly Hills
90210 #

28:23.240 --> 28:26.755
# Oh, every day
another new adventure #

28:26.880 --> 28:31.396
# Every mile
another new zip code #

28:31.520 --> 28:33.988
# And the cares we had
are gone for good #

28:34.120 --> 28:36.076
# And I'd go with them
if I could #

28:36.200 --> 28:40.352
# I got no strings on me
I'm feelin' fancy free #

28:40.480 --> 28:43.438
# How wonderful to be #

28:43.560 --> 28:48.111
# On the open road #

28:48.240 --> 28:51.516
# Ro-oad ##

29:03.040 --> 29:07.477
# You'll all
do-do-do-do #

29:07.600 --> 29:09.795
# Do-do-do Bum-bum-bum #

29:09.920 --> 29:11.672
Grandpa!
Grandpa!

29:14.240 --> 29:17.312
Dad, you're gonna get us killed!

29:17.440 --> 29:20.432
- Why don't you just give me the map?
- Oh, no thanks, son.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.755
Navigating's
a big responsibility.

29:22.880 --> 29:26.350
Besides, you wouldn't wanna
spoil the big surprise!

29:26.480 --> 29:29.438
I'm takin' you someplace
pretty special.

29:36.280 --> 29:39.238
Gosh! It's even better
than I remembered.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.750
No, Mommy! I don't wanna go!

29:42.880 --> 29:44.791
Yeah, fun.
Tell you what.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.070
- I'm just gonna wait
right here in the car.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.909
You party pooper! Come on.
This is gonna be fun!

29:51.040 --> 29:53.679
Oh, howdy there,
folks.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.633
Lester's is proud
to present...

29:56.760 --> 30:00.196
the Possum Posse
Jamboree.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.117
Here it is.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.908
Oh, boy!
Just in time.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.198
Howdy, folks.
Who's your favourite possum?

30:16.320 --> 30:18.595
Lester!

30:20.240 --> 30:22.595
Got us a seat
right up front.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.358
Let me introduce you
to the posse.

30:24.480 --> 30:28.029
Here's Beuford, Beulah
and Mordachai.

30:29.560 --> 30:33.075
Hey, Lester, ready for yodelin'?
Ha-ha-ha.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.270
Sure am, Beuford!

30:35.400 --> 30:37.994
# Now gather 'round my possum pals
Join the jamboree #

30:38.120 --> 30:40.554
- # Come hoot and howl
and holler from the heart #
- Ya-hoo!

30:40.680 --> 30:44.355
This is pathetic.

30:44.480 --> 30:48.553
- # Here in Lester's Possum Park #
- Join in, folks.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.910
This is yodelin' time!

30:56.080 --> 30:59.152
# Lester's Possum Park #
# Yodel-lay-ee ooo-ooo-ooo #

31:07.920 --> 31:10.912
# Don't you wanna be
A- hangin' from a tree #

31:11.040 --> 31:15.716
# We're mighty glad to see ya
And the parking's always free #

31:15.840 --> 31:19.071
# Here at Lester's
Po-Po #

31:19.200 --> 31:22.636
# Po-Possum Park #

31:22.760 --> 31:24.990
# Doodle-do
Diddle-do ##

31:28.640 --> 31:30.471
Hey, that's the ticket!

31:30.600 --> 31:33.353
I'll be right back,
my little possum pal.

31:33.480 --> 31:35.948
My life's a living...

31:36.080 --> 31:37.832
Hello,
little buddy!

31:39.320 --> 31:42.118
Who's your
favourite possum?

31:42.240 --> 31:44.117
Don't touch me.

31:44.240 --> 31:47.516
Aw. Why such
a long face?

31:47.640 --> 31:50.279
You're so sad.

31:50.400 --> 31:53.392
I know! You need
a big hug from Lester.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.750
- Don't even think about it! Agh! No!
- See?

31:55.880 --> 31:59.509
Now you feel
all good inside.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.710
Beat it, doofus!

32:05.720 --> 32:09.235
- Oh, no. No, Dad. Not that. Please.
- Here you go, sport.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.237
What say we get
our picture taken?

32:14.160 --> 32:17.197
- You have got to be kidding.
- Oh, all right.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.709
But you're missin' out.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.351
Hiya, son!

32:26.400 --> 32:28.755
Hey, everyone!
Check out the dork!

32:28.880 --> 32:30.199
Say "sassafras."

32:30.320 --> 32:32.595
Sassy-frass!

32:32.720 --> 32:36.030
Screech!

32:36.160 --> 32:38.151
Ahh! Get it! Get it!

32:41.920 --> 32:44.354
That's the spirit,
Maxie!

32:45.360 --> 32:47.590
Whoa! No!

32:47.720 --> 32:50.109
Dad, stop! Please!
No!

32:50.240 --> 32:52.435
Dad, look,
this is embarrassing.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.676
No, no, no!

32:54.800 --> 32:56.791
Let go! Dad!

33:00.720 --> 33:04.429
It's dork and dork, junior!

33:25.080 --> 33:27.753
- Agh!
- Max!

33:27.880 --> 33:30.030
Hey, what the heck
you tryin' to do?

33:30.160 --> 33:33.596
- Trying to get away from you!
- Me?

33:33.720 --> 33:36.109
- What'd I do?
- Forget it!

33:36.240 --> 33:38.993
I thought we was having fun.
What's the matter?

33:39.120 --> 33:41.873
Nothin'.
Let's just go.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.877
Well, come on!

33:54.240 --> 33:56.037
Hey, you dropped
your hat.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.913
Aah! This is
the stupidest vacation!

33:59.040 --> 34:01.270
You drag me from home,
you jam me in this dumb car,

34:01.400 --> 34:05.712
then drive me a million miles away
to see some stupid rat show!

34:05.840 --> 34:08.149
Call me when
the trip's over.

34:53.159 --> 34:57.790
Hey, Max. You wanna get in
some fishin' practise?

34:57.920 --> 35:01.310
Just a couple of days
'til we get to Lake Destiny.

35:01.440 --> 35:04.193
Maybe later.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.675
Whoa!
Now that's camping.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.394
Did you say somethin',
Max? Ow!

35:48.880 --> 35:50.871
- Pete?
- Goofy?

35:51.000 --> 35:54.754
Oh-ho!
What a serendipity doo-dah!

35:54.880 --> 35:57.075
Who'd've thunk it, huh?
Ha-ha.

35:57.200 --> 36:00.078
- Is P.J. Here?
- Who? Oh, yeah.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.350
I'm sure he's loafin'
around here somewhere.

36:02.480 --> 36:06.473
# It ain't a question of how
Just a matter of when #

36:06.600 --> 36:09.398
- # You get the message
that I'm trying to sing #
- Ooh, ooh, that baby.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.478
# I'm under a spell
I'm in over my head #

36:12.600 --> 36:16.912
- # And you know I'm goin'
all of the way to the end #
- What a goob!

36:17.040 --> 36:20.589
# To stand out
above the crowd #

36:20.720 --> 36:23.314
# Even if you got
to shout out loud #

36:23.440 --> 36:25.635
# No matter what the look is
Max, I get... #

36:25.760 --> 36:27.079
- Max!
- H-H-Hey!

36:27.200 --> 36:29.395
Whoa!
Small wilderness, dude.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.034
- Didn't expect to run into you.
- Apparently not.

36:32.160 --> 36:35.357
You're just jealous, man,
'cause you ain't got the moves!

36:35.480 --> 36:37.277
Yeah, you can
keep the moves.

36:37.400 --> 36:40.790
But I wouldn't mind
havin' this R.V. Oh!

36:41.160 --> 36:45.358
- You are so lucky, man.
- Me? Oh, come on. You're the star.

36:45.440 --> 36:48.079
- Wh-What do you...
- Going to the Powerline concert.

36:48.200 --> 36:51.829
- Ah! It's unbelievable, man.
- Who told you about that?

36:51.960 --> 36:54.599
Hey, come on. Everybody in town
knows about it, Max.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.359
You are gonna be famous,
buddy.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.516
Especially
with Roxanne.

36:59.640 --> 37:04.077
There's, uh, only one person
who doesn't know about it yet, Peej.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.668
- Who?
- My dad.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.711
So tell me, Goof,

37:08.840 --> 37:11.070
is that kid of yours
still givin' you guff?

37:11.200 --> 37:12.997
Oh, I don't know
what's wrong.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.999
Just seems like everything I try
only drives Max further away.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.395
Maybe I oughta just back off.
I don't know.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.317
Wrong, Goof.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.238
Look, if you keep 'em
under your thumb,

37:24.360 --> 37:27.670
they'll never end up
in the gutter.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.036
Too bad, Pete.
Almost.

37:35.160 --> 37:38.277
Almost? Hah!
Watch this.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.913
P.J.!

37:40.040 --> 37:42.429
Here, sir. Comin', sir. Yes, sir.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.231
Whoo-hoo!
Strike-ola!

37:49.360 --> 37:51.590
Yee-haw! Thank you.
Thank you. Yes!

37:51.720 --> 37:54.075
And the crowd goes wild!
Ahh-ha-ha-ha!

37:54.200 --> 37:56.555
High five, son!
Psych!

37:56.680 --> 37:58.716
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

37:58.840 --> 38:01.513
Say, Goof, why don't
you two stay for dinner?

38:01.640 --> 38:03.790
- Cool!
- Oh, no thanks, Pete.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.673
- Max and I have some fish to catch.
- Dad, we can do that tomorrow.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.791
So, uh,
what're we havin'?

38:08.920 --> 38:12.754
- But, Max, I thought...
- A-A-Ahem! Under your thumb, Goof.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.434
- Maximilian!
- What?

38:16.560 --> 38:20.519
Get your gear, little man.
We're goin' fishin'!

38:21.720 --> 38:23.790
And I mean now!

38:31.080 --> 38:34.038
Dad, I don't even know
how to fish.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.350
Oh, now come on.
That never stopped me!

38:36.480 --> 38:38.630
Let me show you
a little family secret...

38:38.760 --> 38:41.752
handed down through about
12 or 13 Goof generations.

38:41.880 --> 38:45.998
- The perfect cast!
- The perfect what?

38:46.120 --> 38:50.033
The perfect cast. My dad taught it
to me when I was about your age.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.072
Okay now, watch carefully.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.475
You gotta be l-l-loose.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.558
Relaxed...
with your feet apart.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.956
And... 10:00,
2:00.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.355
Quarter to 3:00.
Tour jete.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.596
Twist. Over.
Pas de deux.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.790
# I'm a little teapot #
And the windup!

39:12.600 --> 39:15.114
And let her fly!

39:15.240 --> 39:17.231
The perfect cast.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.918
And now we reel her in.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.277
Quick,
get the camera!

39:55.280 --> 39:59.114
Must be over three pounds.
I don't wanna miss this!

40:01.440 --> 40:03.192
Look, Max!

40:03.320 --> 40:05.151
A... duh, duh, Dad?

40:05.280 --> 40:07.430
It's Bigfoot!

40:07.560 --> 40:10.870
Could you back up a bit, Mr Foot?
You're out of focus.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.309
What's the idea?

40:17.240 --> 40:19.754
Bigfoot!

40:23.120 --> 40:25.475
Behold
the legendary Bigfoot!

40:25.600 --> 40:28.512
Fabled, but seldom...
Yeow-hoo-hoo!

40:28.640 --> 40:31.871
- It's locked!
- Quick! The sunroof!

40:34.040 --> 40:35.359
Hurry up!

40:38.120 --> 40:39.599
Hurry up!

40:47.080 --> 40:50.470
I can't believe it!
Bigfoot!

40:50.600 --> 40:53.068
And I got
the only video!

40:53.200 --> 40:55.350
We're gonna be famous!

40:57.280 --> 41:00.033
Huh? Grrr.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.799
Let's just get outta here.

41:25.080 --> 41:27.355
Is he gone yet?

41:36.360 --> 41:39.591
Nope. He's still here.

41:44.520 --> 41:49.036
- Gee, Max, was that Bigfoot
or your stomach?

41:49.160 --> 41:52.277
Man, I'm starving.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.437
Alphabet soup comin' up.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.919
Uh, Dad?

42:03.480 --> 42:05.471
Dad!

42:05.600 --> 42:08.068
Stop playing around!
He's coming!

42:12.280 --> 42:17.035
Music!

42:17.160 --> 42:21.836
# You can tell by the way
I use my walk I'm a woman's man #

42:21.960 --> 42:24.997
# No time to talk #

42:25.120 --> 42:27.236
# I've been kicked around
since I was born #

42:27.360 --> 42:30.591
# But then it's all right
It's okay #

42:30.720 --> 42:33.473
Well, it's nice to know
this thing's good for somethin'.

42:37.800 --> 42:41.952
#Stayin' alive, stayin' alive #

42:42.080 --> 42:44.799
#Stayin' alive #

42:52.760 --> 42:54.398
What's so funny?

42:54.520 --> 42:56.590
"Hi, Dad" soup.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.674
Don't tell me you don't remember
"Hi, Dad" soup!

43:01.960 --> 43:04.030
Oh, come on.
Sure you do!

43:04.160 --> 43:07.789
You used to spell things out
using the letters, like, uh, "Hi, Dad,"

43:07.920 --> 43:09.672
- or Maxie, or...
- Ambidextrous?

43:09.800 --> 43:11.358
Yeah! That's...
Huh?

43:11.480 --> 43:13.630
No!
Little words like...

43:13.760 --> 43:16.035
- Hasta la vista?
- Like bye-bye.

43:16.160 --> 43:19.948
- Or "I pledge allegiance"...
- Ayuk-ayuk. Or "I love you"...

43:24.520 --> 43:26.829
Is, uh...
is it soup yet?

43:26.960 --> 43:29.838
Oh, oh.
I almost forgot.

43:29.960 --> 43:31.837
Whoa!
Where'd you learn to do that?

43:31.960 --> 43:35.191
Your granddad taught me that
when we went to Yosemite.

43:35.320 --> 43:37.629
You two did a lot together,
huh?

43:37.760 --> 43:39.079
Yep.

43:40.720 --> 43:43.075
- Max, you and I...
- Dad, I'm sorry...

43:43.200 --> 43:46.476
Um, um...
how's the soup?

43:47.560 --> 43:49.471
Not bad.
Um, not... Ahem.

43:51.800 --> 43:54.314
- What?
- N-nothin'.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.638
Well, we might as well
get some shuteye.

44:04.760 --> 44:06.591
I don't think we're goin'
anywhere tonight.

44:26.320 --> 44:29.118
Hi, Maxie.

45:04.520 --> 45:06.476
"Dear Roxanne,

45:06.600 --> 45:08.636
I couldn't sleep...

45:08.760 --> 45:11.320
so I thought I'd drop you
a line.

45:11.440 --> 45:14.432
Dad and I are having a great time!
We're only days away from L. A...

45:14.560 --> 45:18.155
and I can hardly wait
for the big concert."

45:18.280 --> 45:20.191
Ahh.

45:20.320 --> 45:23.198
More "Hi, Dad" soup, please.

45:29.480 --> 45:33.314
"Dear Roxanne,
sorry I lied,

45:33.440 --> 45:35.954
but I'm not really going
to the Powerline concert.

45:36.080 --> 45:39.311
You may never want
to see me again..."

45:39.440 --> 45:43.274
Oh, man!
I'm dead no matter what I do!

46:38.720 --> 46:41.917
How many cups of sugar does it take
to get to the moon?

46:42.040 --> 46:45.510
Ah... three and a half?

47:17.880 --> 47:20.553
- Pickup.
- Hold your horses.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.836
- Short stack?
- Right here.

47:26.960 --> 47:28.552
Here you go, hun.
Eggs?

47:28.680 --> 47:30.636
Eggs?

47:30.760 --> 47:32.876
- Eggs!
- Uh-oh, yeah, yeah. Right here. Sorry.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.116
Here you go, cutie.

47:51.760 --> 47:56.072
- Max, I think we need
to talk about this.
- Huh?

47:56.200 --> 48:00.079
Seems to me you need to start
taking some responsibility around here.

48:00.200 --> 48:03.272
Excuse me. Can I have
your attention, please?

48:03.400 --> 48:04.719
A- A-Ahem!

48:04.840 --> 48:08.833
I, Goofy, hereby dub my son
Maximilian...

48:08.960 --> 48:13.988
Official Navigator and Head
"Which-Wayer" of this here road trip.

48:14.120 --> 48:16.554
- Isn't that nice?
- Hee-haw!

48:16.680 --> 48:20.753
- Seriously?
- I'm not even lookin'
at the map any more.

48:20.880 --> 48:24.509
As a matter of fact, you can pick all
the stops from here to Lake Destiny.

48:24.640 --> 48:27.757
I trust you wholeheartedly,
son.

48:27.880 --> 48:30.314
To the open road!

48:30.440 --> 48:32.556
To the... open road!

49:16.200 --> 49:17.633
Oh boy!

50:16.080 --> 50:17.911
Gosh!

50:20.880 --> 50:24.236
Check out the bed!

50:24.360 --> 50:26.954
Check out the dresser!
Coral!

50:27.080 --> 50:29.355
Nice lamp.

50:29.480 --> 50:31.710
Classy choice there,
navigator.

50:31.840 --> 50:33.751
This is the police!

50:33.880 --> 50:37.759
We've got the place surrounded, see?
You Goofs come out with your hands up.

50:41.320 --> 50:44.551
You should've seen
the look on your face!

50:44.780 --> 50:47.638
- You really
had him fooled, Pete!
- Me?

50:47.760 --> 50:49.830
You jumped outta
your skin!

50:49.960 --> 50:52.315
I was just pretendin' for your sake.
- All right, sure!

50:52.440 --> 50:54.510
- Did too!
- Did not!

50:54.640 --> 50:57.677
Oh, ain't this sweet?

50:57.800 --> 51:02.999
Don't let him fool you with that
buddy-buddy act now. Under your thumb!

51:03.120 --> 51:07.033
So... since we're all bein'
palsy-walsy here,

51:07.160 --> 51:09.196
- how 'bout lettin' me hook up the R.V.
- Well...

51:09.320 --> 51:13.108
- Oh, it's just a little tiny extension
cord. You'll hardly even notice it.
- Okay.

51:13.240 --> 51:14.753
Great!
P.J.!

51:19.560 --> 51:24.031
Hey, Goof, why don't you order
us a pizza? This might take a while.

51:26.920 --> 51:30.833
- No, I mean it... Ahh!
- Here you go, kids.
I'm gonna check out the hot tub.

51:30.960 --> 51:32.757
- Okay, sir.
- All right.

51:32.880 --> 51:34.711
I can't believe you, man.

51:34.840 --> 51:37.877
Whatever made you think your dad
would fall for a stupid idea like that?

51:38.000 --> 51:40.230
- It wasn't stupid!
- Come on! It was really stupid.

51:40.360 --> 51:42.396
Changing the map?

51:42.520 --> 51:46.308
I didn't know what I was doin',
all right? I-I was panicked.

51:49.800 --> 51:54.237
Oof-oof-oof.
Oh-oh-ah-ah!

51:54.360 --> 51:56.920
Ahh!

52:03.240 --> 52:06.755
Taking a break from
the M.T.V. Generation, huh?

52:06.880 --> 52:09.348
Can't say as I blame ya.

52:09.480 --> 52:12.199
People are always puttin'
too much water in these things.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.470
So, um...

52:14.600 --> 52:18.229
you and your son seem to be, uh,
gettin' along just hunky-dory, huh?

52:18.360 --> 52:20.430
Yeah!
It's been great!

52:20.560 --> 52:23.120
You know, it's funny, but none
of your techniques worked for me.

52:23.240 --> 52:25.959
The harder I tried,
the worse it got.

52:26.080 --> 52:29.789
- Once I eased up, things just clicked!
- Oh, that's swell.

52:29.920 --> 52:32.992
So, there's
no problems then, huh?

52:33.120 --> 52:34.917
Not a one!

52:37.000 --> 52:40.675
That's uh...
I just hate to be...

52:40.800 --> 52:43.997
- the bearer of bad news, but uh...
- What is it, Pete?

52:44.120 --> 52:48.159
- Your kid's dupin' ya.
- What do you mean?

52:48.280 --> 52:51.113
Well, I heard the little mutant tellin'
P.J. That he changed the map,

52:51.240 --> 52:53.993
so you're headin' straight
to L.A., pal.

52:54.120 --> 52:57.396
- What?
- Ahh, you tried, Goof.

52:57.520 --> 53:02.230
- He's just a bad kid, that's all.
- I don't believe you.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.749
- What?
- I don't believe ya, Pete!

53:04.880 --> 53:08.031
Well hey, don't take my word for it.
Check your map.

53:08.160 --> 53:12.790
I don't need to check the map.
I trust my son.

53:12.920 --> 53:16.754
You know, maybe Max isn't all the things
that you think a son should be.

53:16.880 --> 53:18.871
But... he loves me.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.309
Hey, my son respects me!

53:21.440 --> 53:23.590
Yeah.

53:25.320 --> 53:27.914
Check the map, Goof!

54:00.040 --> 54:02.315
Hi, Dad.

54:04.360 --> 54:07.909
Sorry about the mess.
I- I'll clean it up.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.874
- Me think I better go.
- See ya, Peej.

54:21.000 --> 54:25.073
- Don't forget... Powerline!
- Shh!

54:59.720 --> 55:02.951
Well, here you go,
navigator.

55:03.080 --> 55:05.833
Just follow my route
on the map, son.

55:07.080 --> 55:08.718
Okay.

55:12.600 --> 55:14.591
Here comes our junction.

55:17.800 --> 55:20.360
Okay, Max, now this is it.
Left or right?

55:20.480 --> 55:21.993
Uh...

55:24.320 --> 55:25.878
Come on, Max!

55:26.000 --> 55:27.991
Uh, l-left!

55:40.600 --> 55:44.673
Uh... how 'bout
a song, Dad?

55:44.800 --> 55:48.190
Uh... a game? A game. Yeah!
Yeah, a game. Okay.

55:48.320 --> 55:51.551
Uh...
a man or woman?

55:51.680 --> 55:53.989
A man? Man, okay.
Uh... Walt Disney!

56:18.640 --> 56:22.155
Dad... listen,
about my directions...

56:22.280 --> 56:25.078
Will you listen to me?
I gotta tell you somethin', Dad.

56:25.200 --> 56:28.795
Why bother? I'm probably too stupid
to understand anyway.

56:28.920 --> 56:30.592
Right?

56:30.720 --> 56:33.632
Ahh, forget it.

56:46.800 --> 56:48.677
H- H-Hey, the car!

56:48.800 --> 56:51.314
- What? Now you want to drive too?
- No, Dad.

56:51.440 --> 56:52.998
The car! Look!

56:53.120 --> 56:55.111
The car!

56:58.680 --> 57:01.911
- What'd you do now, Max?
- I didn't do anything, Dad.
I only touched it.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.309
W- W-Whoa!

57:09.880 --> 57:12.075
You locked it!

57:12.200 --> 57:15.795
I locked it? It's your door.
You locked it.

57:15.920 --> 57:18.718
Well, you distracted me.
Whoa!

57:18.840 --> 57:21.832
You should've put the brake on.

57:21.960 --> 57:23.791
Why don't you just
put it on yourself?

57:23.920 --> 57:26.309
See?
You ruin everything.

57:28.320 --> 57:31.471
W- well, y-you r-ruined
the vacation.

57:31.600 --> 57:34.034
I ruined it?

57:34.160 --> 57:38.233
- I never... wanted to go...
on this stupid...

57:38.360 --> 57:41.636
vacationnnnnn!

57:49.600 --> 57:51.670
Ahh! Ahh!

57:51.800 --> 57:54.758
- Now look where you've got us, Dad!
- Where I got us?

57:54.880 --> 57:57.075
- You should've let me stay at home.
- Why?

57:57.200 --> 57:59.236
So you'd end up
in prison?

57:59.360 --> 58:02.318
Prison?
What are you talkin' about?

58:02.440 --> 58:05.432
- Your principal called me.
- It's not what you think.

58:05.560 --> 58:07.357
You even lied to me!

58:07.480 --> 58:09.630
I had to!
You were ruining my life.

58:09.760 --> 58:13.070
I was only tryin'
to take my boy fishin', okay?

58:13.200 --> 58:15.794
I'm not your little boy
any more, Dad!

58:15.920 --> 58:18.878
I've grown up.
I've got my own life now.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.754
I know that!
I just wanted to be part of it.

58:26.480 --> 58:29.711
You're my son, Max.
No matter how big you get,

58:29.840 --> 58:32.479
you'll always be my son.

59:19.400 --> 59:23.712
# There are times you drive me,
shall we say, bananas #

59:23.840 --> 59:28.630
- # And your mind is missin',
no offence, a screw #
- None taken.

59:28.760 --> 59:31.035
# Still whatever mess
I land in #

59:31.160 --> 59:33.799
# Who is
always understandin' #

59:33.920 --> 59:37.151
# Nobody else but you #

59:37.280 --> 59:42.912
# Oh, your moodiness is
now and then bewilderin' #

59:43.040 --> 59:45.998
# And your values may be,
so to speak, askew #

59:46.120 --> 59:47.394
- Gesundheit.
- Thanks.

59:47.520 --> 59:50.193
# Who deserves
a hero's trophy #

59:50.320 --> 59:52.390
# As we face
each "catastro-phee" #

59:52.520 --> 59:57.469
# Nobody else but you #

59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.752
# Nobody else but you #

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.677
# It's just our luck #

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.837
# We're stuck together #

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.715
# Nobody else but you #

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:17.676
# Is crazy enough to believe
we'll come through #

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.749
# So your jokes are all,
let's face it, prehistoric #

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:27.396
# And your music sounds
like monkeys in a zoo #

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.954
# But when life
becomes distressin' #

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.150
# Who will I be S.O. Sin' #

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.671
# If you're havin' trouble
guessing, here's a clue #

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.268
# Though he seems
intoxicated #

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.709
# He's just
highly animated #

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.513
# And he's nobody else
but #

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.269
# Nobody else but you #

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.472
# We've turned into #

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.955
# A true-blue duo #

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.039
# Hard times
we've had a few #

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.196
# Like we're
thrown in the drink #

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.515
# Like we're
tossed out of town #

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.870
# But when I start
to sink #

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.753
# Hey, I'd rather go down #

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.677
# With nobody else #

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:14.874
# But Y-O-U ##

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.151
Aw, Dad!

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.790
Anyway, I figure she's never
gonna want to talk to me again,

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.996
much less go out with me.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.714
- What a dumb lie, huh?
- What do you know?

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.673
My Maxie... in love.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.189
Gosh, you're really
growin' up.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.758
It happened so fast...
I guess I sort of missed it.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.474
Well, I think the only thing
for us to do now...

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.114
is to get you up onstage
with this Powerline feller.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.277
Uh, how are we gonna do that?

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.437
- Well, you just leave that up to me.
- No, Dad, really,

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.676
I- I think we should just,
you know, forget it.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.156
Now how come you always think I'm gonna
lead you into some sort of calamity?

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.077
Uh, uh, Dad? Dad?

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.634
- What's wrong now?
- Look!

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.991
A waterfall!

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.917
Waterfall!

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.756
Dad!

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.836
Max!

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.670
Grab ahold, Max!

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.274
No!

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.152
No!

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.478
Dad!

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.230
10:00, 2:00, quarter to three.
Tour jete.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.396
Twist. # I'm a little teapot #
Let her fly!

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.117
The perfect cast.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.318
Boy, this has been
one crazy vacation.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.237
And it's not over yet!

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.629
- Dad.
- Oof. We made it!

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.830
Come on, Max.
Let's get you onstage.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.192
- Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
- # Yeah, yeah #

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.390
Ooh, then again...

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.511
Dad? Dad!

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.757
# Hey yeah #

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.595
# I got myself
a notion #

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:04.038
# One I know
that you'll understand #

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.914
# We set the world
in motion #

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.350
# By reaching out
for each other's hand #

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.198
- Dad?
- # Maybe we'll discover #

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.709
# What we should
have known all along #

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.434
- What are you doin' here? Hey!
- # Yeah #

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.028
- Max? Max?
- # One way or another #

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.276
# Together's where we both belong #

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.359
# If we listen
to each other's heart #

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:30.233
# We'll find
we're never too far apart #

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.875
# And maybe love
is the reason why #

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.278
# For the first time ever
we're seein' it 1-2-1I #

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.277
That Goof kid
ain't there.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.278
Don't worry,
he'll be there.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:48.997
# Seein' it l-2-I
Seein' it l-2-I #

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.190
Excuse me.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.550
# Seein' it
l-2-I #

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.750
- # I think we're seein' it #
- Max?

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.838
Hey, Dad. Dad!
Do the perfect cast.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.556
# If you're ever lonely #

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.638
# Stop
You don't have to be #

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.634
# After all it's only a beat away
from you to me #

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.671
# Take a look inside
to see #

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.794
# Yeah, if we listen
to each other's heart #

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.198
Yeah! Max is on the tube!
That's Max. I know him!

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.595
# And maybe love
is the reason why #

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.393
# For the first time ever
we're seein' it l-2-I #

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.715
He did it!

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.558
# Seein' it l-2-I #

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.671
# Seein' it l-2-I, baby #

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:55.750
- # For the first time #
- # For the first time #

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.558
- # Seein' it, seein' it, baby #
- Yeah!

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.399
# Yeah, yeah #

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.718
- # For the first time ever
Yeah, yeah, yeah #
- # Come on, baby #

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.196
- # l-2-I #
- # l-2-I #

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.756
# l-2-I #

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.917
# Yeah ##

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.472
You're doin'
the right thing, son.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:36.798
Yeah, I know. But she'll probably
never talk to me again.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.876
Well, if she doesn't,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.434
maybe she's just not
the one for you.

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.595
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.715
Grrr.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.592
Ah, hi!
Remember me?

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.392
Daddy!

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.958
Max, I saw you on TV.
You were great!

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.037
Yeah?
I mean, no, no.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.627
I mean, uh...

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.752
Roxanne, I lied to you.
I don't even know Powerline.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.872
What are you talking about?
A billion people saw you dance with him.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.877
Yeah, well...

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.198
I never met him before...
the concert, that is.

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:37.154
You mean that story
about Powerline and your dad?

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.397
- Why would you make up
something like that?
- I don't know.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.910
I guess I just...
wanted you to like me.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.395
I already liked you,
Max.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.037
From the very first time
I heard you laugh.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.469
"Ayuk."

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:57.229
- So, you wanna do something tonight?
- Definitely!

01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:00.113
- Oh! Oh, no, I can't. I can't.
- What?

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.879
Well, I'm kinda doin'
somethin' with my dad.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.718
Honest!

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.274
- How 'bout tomorrow?
- Deal.

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.515
Roxanne, I'd like you
to meet my dad.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.108
Enchante, mademoiselle.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.635
# I got myself a notion #

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.070
# And one I know
that you'll understand #

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.590

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.152
# Maybe we'll discover #

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:46.308
# What we should

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:51.070

# For the first time ever
we're seein' it l-2-I #

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.429
# If a wall should come
between us #

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.916
# Too high to climb
Too hard to break through #

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.476
# I know that love
will lead us #

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.149
# And find a way
to bring me to you #

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:39.274
# So don't be in a hurry
Think before you count us out #

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:43.109
# Oh, you don't have to worry #

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.756
- # I will never let you down #
- # Nothin's gonna stop us now #

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.714
# If we listen
to each other's heart #

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.798
