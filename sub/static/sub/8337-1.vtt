01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:06.703
I'm mean and green.

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.455
Mean green mother from outer space

I'm mean and green.

01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:14.126
Mean green mother from outer space

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:03.843

[SINGING] Subsequent to the events
You have just witnessed.

01:30:51.029 --> 01:30:56.877
Similar events in cities across America.

01:30:57.077 --> 01:31:02.550
Events which bore
A striking resemblance.

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:08.677
To the ones you have just seen
Began occurring.

01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:11.307

01:31:11.466 --> 01:31:15.972
Subsequent to the events
You have just witnessed.

01:31:16.179 --> 01:31:21.276
Unsuspecting jerks
From Maine to California.

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:26.573
<i>Made the acquaintance
Of a new breed of fly-trap.</i>

01:31:26.773 --> 01:31:32.325
And got sweet-talked
Into feeding it blood.

01:31:34.197 --> 01:31:38.919
Thus the plants worked
Their terrible will.

01:31:39.119 --> 01:31:43.215
Finding jerks
Who would feed them their fill.

01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:47.761
And the plants proceeded to grow.

01:31:47.961 --> 01:31:50.055
And grow.

01:31:50.255 --> 01:31:55.102
And began what they came here to do.

01:31:55.301 --> 01:31:58.976
Which was essentially to.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:03.310
Eat Cleveland.

01:32:03.476 --> 01:32:07.481

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:11.444
And Peoria.

01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:15.701
And New York.

01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:17.407
And where you live

01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:19.750

01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:26.416

Love and money and instant acclaim.

01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:34.345
But whatever they offer you
Don't feed the plants.

01:32:36.426 --> 01:32:39.555
They may offer you lots of cheap thrills.

01:32:39.763 --> 01:32:42.812
Dates and discos in Beverly Hills.

01:32:43.016 --> 01:32:47.487

To eat the world whole.

If we fight it
We've still got a chance.

But whatever they offer you.

01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:20.693
Though they're slopping the trough
For you.

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:27.499
Please whatever they offer you
Don '2' feed the plants
