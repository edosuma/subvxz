<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:03.036 --> 00:06.870
You have exactly the right voice
for a new magazine I'm starting.

00:06.906 --> 00:10.000
I want you to help me run it. In London.

00:10.443 --> 00:13.003
You know, there is something
about you that I automatically liked.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.673
I would do anything for that girl.

00:14.714 --> 00:17.274
<i>My biological father has
that Tweety Bird tattoo.</i>

00:17.317 --> 00:19.114
It's a great feeling, isn't it?

00:19.152 --> 00:21.882
Everything is right in the world.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.922
Hi, Mr. Dunne.
I would like to accept your offer.

00:26.092 --> 00:28.219
I don't want anything from you.

00:28.261 --> 00:31.719
I'm the one who made you feel this way.
Give me the gun.

00:38.605 --> 00:42.735
Fashionista, trendsetter, loyal friend.

00:43.943 --> 00:48.778
<i>This cherished icon,
who once walked the halls of Mode,</i>

00:49.149 --> 00:51.549
is now eating out of the hands of angels

00:51.584 --> 00:54.883
and soiling the carpets of heaven
for all eternity.

00:55.355 --> 00:56.549
- Amen.
Hallelujah.

00:56.589 --> 00:59.717
Poor Halston.
He was a good dog, Amanda.

01:00.527 --> 01:01.755
He was.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.423
Goodbye, Halston.

01:05.932 --> 01:07.331
I can't believe it, Marc.

01:07.367 --> 01:10.859
The only connection to the mother
I never knew is gone.

Officer, there they are!

01:27.520 --> 01:30.387
Amanda, you said you got a permit
for this, right?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.588
Run! Run!

Run!

<i>With Mode just weeks away from
publishing its 100th anniversary issue,</i>

01:50.043 --> 01:53.501
Wilhelmina Slater is still unconscious
after a mysterious shooting

01:53.546 --> 01:54.877
<i>at the Mode offices.</i>

01:56.149 --> 01:59.175
And that bullet must've been filled
with beauty powder

01:59.219 --> 02:01.949
because she looks ravishing.

02:01.988 --> 02:05.719
So far, the only information we have
is that her longtime nemesis,

02:05.758 --> 02:07.783
Claire Meade, was the sole witness.

02:07.827 --> 02:10.294
She claims
the shooting was an accident,

02:10.330 --> 02:12.525
which has fashionistas everywhere

02:12.565 --> 02:14.795
- straining to raise their eyebrows.
- Come on, let's go!

02:14.834 --> 02:17.200
B, how can you move to London?

02:17.237 --> 02:20.138
<i>Won't you miss all the kidnapping,
shooting and murder at Mode?</i>

02:20.173 --> 02:22.767
- No. Not really.
- This looks so good.

02:22.809 --> 02:26.802
Yeah, I've got to say, I'm really glad
I'm becoming a part of this Latin family.

02:26.846 --> 02:30.612
Kid, we are gonna spice you up so
much you're gonna forget you're white.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.413
Okay, this smells amazing. Let's eat.

02:32.452 --> 02:39.016
Nuh-uh. Hands off. For you, sheep's
heart, liver and lung, stuffed in intestine.

02:39.058 --> 02:41.117
Otherwise known as haggis.

02:43.296 --> 02:44.888
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

02:44.931 --> 02:46.125
Oh, my God, I'm gonna vomit.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.693
<i>Papi, why? I'm fine just eating
what everyone else is eating.</i>

02:49.736 --> 02:51.931
<i>Mi hija, that's what they eat in the UK.</i>

02:51.971 --> 02:53.962
We need to toughen up your stomach
before you go.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.500
Unless you want to stay.

02:57.577 --> 03:00.910
<i>- Papi, I am taking the job in London.
- I understand.</i>

03:03.116 --> 03:05.607
Look, so I've been looking at a couple
of houses that look pretty good.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.244
- He's in the other room.
- You guys are moving?

03:09.289 --> 03:12.520
<i>We are just looking.
We haven't told Papi yet.</i>

03:12.559 --> 03:15.687
With you leaving and everything,
it's just, it's a hard time.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.821
He's gonna have to get used to it
some time.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.264
Besides, I saw some nice places
in Bay Ridge.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.665
Bay Ridge?

03:22.936 --> 03:25.564
Look, just swear that we are gonna look
in Manhattan.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.596
And thanks to the Great Recession,
you'd be surprised

03:27.640 --> 03:29.631
on how affordable things are now.

03:29.676 --> 03:33.168
Hey! Betty,
you haven't touched the haggis.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.646
Trust me,
you don't want to eat it when it's cold.

03:35.782 --> 03:36.942
That's my phone.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.952
- What's a matter with you? What...
- Where'd you even find that?

03:39.986 --> 03:41.977
It's Daniel. Hi, Daniel.

03:42.522 --> 03:43.819
Yes.

03:43.856 --> 03:46.324
I can be right there. Sorry, guys.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.984
Daniel needs me,
so I guess I'll just have to eat with him.

03:50.029 --> 03:53.192
Are you finally gonna tell him
that you're moving to London?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.394
Yes, I am going to tell him.

03:55.702 --> 03:58.728
It's just not easy, okay?
He gave me my start.

03:58.771 --> 04:02.764
I owe him everything, but I made
my decision and I'm gonna tell him.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.538
Sorry I can't stay for dinner.

04:06.512 --> 04:07.672
You really haven't missed that much.

04:07.714 --> 04:11.673
We had this ridiculous aborted funeral
for Amanda's dog.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.744
She brought that big queen
who I think is her father,

04:16.488 --> 04:17.750
but I'm not sure.

04:17.790 --> 04:21.021
And I would just hate for her
to have to go through all that again.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.028
What else can I tell you?

04:23.062 --> 04:27.522
Oh, well, I'm still not over Troy,
even though he's got a boyfriend.

04:28.668 --> 04:29.794
What?

04:31.704 --> 04:32.966
Stop it!

04:33.439 --> 04:34.929
I like him.

04:35.541 --> 04:37.338
Oh, you're so bad.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.908
Willie,

04:43.082 --> 04:46.483
I knew your obsession with the Meades
would get the better of you.

04:46.519 --> 04:47.952
Now look at you.

04:47.987 --> 04:51.320
Your makeup is still flawless,
but you're in a coma.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.826
I just want you to be happy,

04:54.861 --> 04:58.353
because all this scheming,
it's killing you.

05:03.536 --> 05:07.472
You know, I think this is
the best conversation we've ever had.

05:09.542 --> 05:10.804
Are you crazy?

05:10.843 --> 05:13.641
Look, you're doing
your fishy face thing in this one.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.614
No, I'm not. That's just my face.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.173
No, it's not!
And you're standing like a robot.

05:18.217 --> 05:20.708
So, my shoulders don't droop.
What's the matter with that?

05:20.753 --> 05:25.122
Daniel, this is your big picture
for the 100th anniversary issue.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.423
This looks like the guy
that I met my first day on the job.

05:28.461 --> 05:31.021
This is posey Daniel.
You're not that guy anymore.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.295
Well, thank you.
I will take that as a compliment.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.800
So, Daniel.

05:37.837 --> 05:38.861
Uh...

05:39.472 --> 05:42.669
Listen. There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.267
Wait, one quick thing.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.301
In this issue,
we're doing profiles of everyone

05:46.346 --> 05:48.211
<i>who's ever been Editor-in-Chief
of Mode,</i>

05:48.247 --> 05:50.977
and I was hoping
maybe you'd write mine.

05:51.684 --> 05:55.381
Really? Oh, my God, I would love that.

05:55.988 --> 05:57.979
Good. Because, I've got to tell you,

05:58.024 --> 06:00.891
there's no way I could have done
this job without you.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.293
I think we make a good team,
you and me.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.965
So, I interrupted you.
What were you saying?

06:08.334 --> 06:09.426
Um...

06:10.703 --> 06:12.694
You know what? I forgot.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.023
Good morning, sunshine.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.892
No, I haven't had a chance
to tell Daniel yet.

06:36.929 --> 06:39.397
Well, don't you think he'll notice
when you stop showing up for work

06:39.432 --> 06:41.024
- in three weeks?
- Hilda, I can't talk about this.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.763
I'm at work, and if anyone here
finds out I'm taking a job in London,

06:43.803 --> 06:46.601
- it will spread like wildfire.
- You're taking a job in London?

06:46.639 --> 06:50.939
Marc, please,
please, don't say anything.

06:50.977 --> 06:54.071
Daniel doesn't know yet.
Just give me a chance to tell him first.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.081
Of course, of course. I totally get it.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.015
- I'm not going to tell anyone.
- What are you doing?

06:58.050 --> 07:00.109
What are you doing? Marc!

07:00.153 --> 07:01.177
Oops.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.119
- You did not.
- I totally did.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.064
Say hi to the Beckhams.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.500
Hey, Betty, have fun in London!

07:19.071 --> 07:23.508
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, God, no. No, don't send that.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.568
That's not yours to send!

07:26.212 --> 07:28.646
Stop. Stop, stop, stop!

07:29.482 --> 07:30.881
Oh, my God!

07:31.284 --> 07:35.277
Stop! Don't take any calls.
Give me five minutes alone with him!

07:36.956 --> 07:38.184
Daniel!

07:39.592 --> 07:42.789
- Betty.
- I have something I have to tell you,

07:42.829 --> 07:44.387
and it's big.

07:44.430 --> 07:47.092
Bigger than you taking a job
in London?

08:05.618 --> 08:09.054
I'm so sorry you found out
before I could tell you.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.784
Daniel, I am so grateful
for these last four years.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.951
It has been a pleasure
working with you.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.429
- Actually, an honor, and...
- Did you rehearse this?

08:17.463 --> 08:18.953
A little.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.694
Daniel, we're always gonna be friends
and I...

08:21.734 --> 08:23.395
Betty, it's fine.

08:25.771 --> 08:26.965
It is?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.331
Yeah.

08:29.375 --> 08:30.501
Okay.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.043
- Great.
- Is there anything else?

08:35.181 --> 08:41.484
Yeah, I need you to sign this form
releasing me from my contract.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.087
They need it tomorrow.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.151
<i>Yep, no problemo.</i>

08:47.927 --> 08:49.053
Okay.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.256
Great.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.164
When I heard
what happened, I had to come.

09:02.341 --> 09:04.935
Connor, I don't understand.
How did you...

09:04.977 --> 09:06.274
Get out of jail?

09:06.312 --> 09:09.577
Talked a guard into letting me out
for a few hours. He's just outside.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.912
But I thought you'd been transferred.

09:14.287 --> 09:18.223
That's what I needed you to believe
so that you could move on.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.424
But, Willie,

09:21.861 --> 09:23.886
I can't live without you.

09:32.838 --> 09:36.137
Okay, let's calm down
before we put you back in that coma.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.234
It would be worth it.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.640
I spent my entire life fighting
for a magazine

09:42.682 --> 09:45.446
when I should have been fighting
for you.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.118
It's all gonna be different now.

09:50.022 --> 09:53.150
Wilhelmina Slater
is a completely changed woman.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.858
Well, I hope not completely changed.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.659
There were some parts of you
I rather liked.

10:07.573 --> 10:11.771
Hi, Daniel. Just a little reminder
that I need to get that paper signed.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.541
No biggie. When you can. By tomorrow.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.708
Earlier is better.
But nothing that inconveniences you.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.644
<i>Hi, Papi.</i>

10:20.686 --> 10:23.314
Did you know that London
is the dirtiest city in Europe?

10:23.356 --> 10:25.381
- What?
- I'm reading this online.

10:25.424 --> 10:28.518
The dirtiest city and the most
expensive, with the worst food.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.359
And they say the people there
are the most unfriendly in the world.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.797
You know, I was there.
It didn't seem so bad.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.425
This is on the Internet, Betty.

10:35.768 --> 10:37.258
<i>Want me to send it to you?</i>

10:39.472 --> 10:42.805
<i>- Mi hija, what's wrong?
- I'll call you back. Amanda!</i>

10:43.275 --> 10:46.608
- Are you okay?
- How could you put your dead dog

10:46.646 --> 10:48.307
in my refrigerator?

10:48.347 --> 10:50.372
That dead dog has a name.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.411
Halston.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.351
And he is simply being
cryo-genitally preserved

10:54.387 --> 10:57.879
- until I can give him a proper farewell.
- In my fridge?

10:57.923 --> 10:59.413
We are a food-free household.

10:59.458 --> 11:02.894
And you need to lose a little weight,
so it's really a win-win.

11:02.928 --> 11:05.761
Get him out. Please.
I'm going for a walk.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.695
- Hey, Betty?
- What?

11:09.035 --> 11:10.832
I heard you're moving to London,

11:11.570 --> 11:15.233
and I just want to say
that I'm really gonna miss you.

11:19.779 --> 11:22.407
Thank you, Amanda.
That is very sweet.

11:26.585 --> 11:28.951
So, really, I can't just keep Halston
in your fridge for a little bit?

11:28.988 --> 11:30.046
No.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.889
Claire. Before this happened,

11:36.929 --> 11:39.295
you would've been the last person
in the world I'd want to see.

11:39.331 --> 11:42.892
Well, I'm just happy to see
that you're awake.

11:42.935 --> 11:45.904
That's nice.
It's very sweet of you to visit.

11:46.472 --> 11:47.939
I need to talk to you.

11:50.843 --> 11:53.505
We're saying that Tyler had nothing
to do with your shooting.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.912
You need to corroborate our story.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.040
I do?

11:57.249 --> 12:00.480
You made him drink,
you supplied him with a gun.

12:00.519 --> 12:03.283
This is your doing, Wilhelmina,
and you need to fix this.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.785
This is what we can offer you.

12:10.763 --> 12:13.425
It's funny,
I would have been happy with flowers.

12:13.466 --> 12:17.527
Or perhaps a handwritten note saying,
"Thank you for saving my life. "

12:17.570 --> 12:21.404
Oh, please, I know exactly who you are.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.841
And you're going to milk this
until you can get your manicured claws

12:24.877 --> 12:26.538
into our company.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.912
Because Wilhelmina only does things
that help Wilhelmina.

12:33.152 --> 12:36.485
Well, I guess you know me better
than I know myself.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.494
Now flap those batwings of yours
and get out!

13:24.403 --> 13:29.431
Look, I'm sorry. But in my defense,
it looked a lot cooler in my head.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.535
I don't understand.
I thought you were okay with it.

13:32.578 --> 13:34.307
<i>You said "no problemo. "</i>

13:34.346 --> 13:36.473
<i>Well, it is a problemo. I'm angry.</i>

13:36.515 --> 13:38.346
I can't believe
you'd make a decision that big

13:38.384 --> 13:40.944
without talking to me about it. At all.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.351
I'm sorry.

13:44.523 --> 13:46.787
Look, I don't want us to end
on bad terms.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.851
I don't either.
I just don't know how I feel

13:48.894 --> 13:51.624
about releasing you from your contract.

13:52.731 --> 13:56.189
- What are you saying?
- We've invested a lot in you, Betty.

13:56.235 --> 13:59.693
If it was anyone else, I'd say no.
I need to think about this.

14:00.739 --> 14:02.172
Okay.

14:02.208 --> 14:06.736
Well, they need the form right away
or I'll lose the job.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.043
I said I would think about it.

14:10.883 --> 14:14.444
All right. Well,
then I guess we'll talk about it later.

14:18.257 --> 14:20.623
I mean, can you believe the nerve
of that Claire?

14:20.659 --> 14:22.217
What have I ever done to her?

14:22.595 --> 14:25.086
Several things come to mind.
Like, I don't know,

14:25.130 --> 14:27.530
stealing sperm
from her husband's corpse.

14:27.566 --> 14:30.797
Well, the craziest thing is,
before Old Chicken Neck showed up,

14:30.836 --> 14:35.432
I was just so happy to be alive,
just willing to let the whole thing go.

14:35.474 --> 14:37.942
That's not crazy, that's wonderful.

14:37.977 --> 14:42.380
It was a moment of weakness.
If those idiots want me to save Tyler,

14:42.414 --> 14:44.905
they're gonna have to hand over
the whole damn company.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.975
Willie, don't say that. That's wrong.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.986
You're one to be judging me, Marc.

14:50.022 --> 14:52.047
After all these years,
whenever I needed something

14:52.091 --> 14:55.288
that was morally questionable,
you were right there with me.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.695
You're right.
I was willing to do anything for you.

15:04.203 --> 15:08.105
You were like my mother.
My goddess, my diva.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.267
You know, you were my life.

15:12.478 --> 15:16.039
I thought that if you had everything
you wanted, you'd be happy,

15:16.081 --> 15:19.141
but you'll never be happy.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.184
There's always something more.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.018
- Thank you. Hi, Betty.
- Hi, Mrs. Meade.

15:32.064 --> 15:35.431
You sound like I feel, which isn't great.
What's going on?

15:35.467 --> 15:37.901
I don't want to bore you
with my problems.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.199
Betty, please.

15:39.238 --> 15:42.264
The last two weeks have been nothing
but gunshots and comas.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.970
I would love to hear your problems.

15:45.010 --> 15:49.674
Well, actually, it's sort of about Daniel.

15:52.918 --> 15:57.821
- There you are. What are you doing?
- You know I steal when I get upset.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.014
Spencer screamed at me.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.118
He ended up in one of those
"Who Wore It Better?" columns.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.924
And only 82% of people said

16:03.963 --> 16:06.261
Ellen DeGeneres wore the suit better
than he did.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.993
- No.
- I hate him and he's dead to me.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.763
- I never want to talk to him again.
- He's your father.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.338
Is everything okay, dear?

16:15.374 --> 16:18.571
Yeah, it's just Betty.
She wants to leave and...

16:18.610 --> 16:19.872
I heard.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.639
I tawt I taw the Tweety Bird tattoo
when he lifted up his shirt

16:22.681 --> 16:24.672
and a little bit of crackage popped out.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.947
I didn't want to say anything to you
because, well, I wasn't sure.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.251
But then Halston died,
and you were so sad.

16:30.289 --> 16:31.688
Oh, my God.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.449
Marc, what am I gonna do?
Should I tell him?

16:34.493 --> 16:36.688
But then what if I tell him
and he rejects me?

16:36.729 --> 16:39.698
What if he's not my father and I have
to go through all of this all over again?

16:39.732 --> 16:42.166
What if you have to go through this
all over again?

16:42.201 --> 16:44.135
Hey, Amanda.
Wow, we see you more now

16:44.169 --> 16:45.932
than when you actually worked here.

16:45.971 --> 16:48.098
Not funny, Suarez!
That's not funny at all!

16:48.140 --> 16:50.199
That's terrible timing!

16:50.509 --> 16:53.706
Sorry. I'm not doing well
with anyone around here today.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.112
Okay, seriously, whatever drama
you got going on today,

16:56.148 --> 16:59.311
I've been sucked into enough.
I don't need it!

17:02.421 --> 17:03.911
So, what's up?

17:05.190 --> 17:08.590
Well, look, before I go to London,
I have to get released from my contract.

17:08.627 --> 17:12.256
Oh, God, Betty. Honestly. Go on.

17:12.664 --> 17:14.825
Okay, are we talking or not?

17:14.867 --> 17:15.891
Mmm-hmm.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.665
Just the other night we were here
talking and working.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.435
I mean, she's writing my bio.
I wouldn't trust anyone else to do that.

17:22.473 --> 17:26.308
Are you sure this isn't about
more than just Betty's editing skills?

17:26.345 --> 17:27.743
What are you talking about?

17:27.780 --> 17:31.773
I'm talking about the fact
that you might have feelings for her.

17:32.251 --> 17:33.377
What?

17:33.419 --> 17:36.820
- He's a bully and he's manipulative.
- And he has a weak chin.

17:36.855 --> 17:37.913
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

17:37.956 --> 17:39.685
- What? No. No, he doesn't.
- Well...

17:39.725 --> 17:40.783
What does that have to do
with anything?

17:40.826 --> 17:42.259
- Keep... Keep ranting. Go.
- He's...

17:42.294 --> 17:43.989
Come on, Mom, that's crazy!

17:44.063 --> 17:46.759
Perhaps. Or could it explain
your behavior?

17:46.799 --> 17:48.892
What? No. No way.

17:48.934 --> 17:52.131
Daniel, darling, you were so upset
at the possibility of her leaving

17:52.171 --> 17:53.604
you nearly burned down your office.

17:53.639 --> 17:57.097
If you are having such a hard time
with her leaving,

17:57.142 --> 17:59.667
you need to give her a reason to stay.

17:59.711 --> 18:02.202
Well, I think you need to go
and give him a piece of your mind.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.374
- You know what? I will.
- Yeah.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.680
- Thanks.
- Good. You're welcome.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.278
- Daniel, I...
- Me first.

18:09.321 --> 18:11.687
Betty, I can't live without you.

18:23.969 --> 18:26.369
So, what exactly did Daniel say?

18:26.405 --> 18:27.929
He offered me a promotion.

18:27.973 --> 18:31.534
Full-fledged editor
and a really nice bump in salary.

18:31.577 --> 18:34.569
- That's major, AB.
- I know. What do I do?

18:34.613 --> 18:36.444
Seems pretty clear to me.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.006
<i>- You have to take it.
- Papi, come on.</i>

18:38.050 --> 18:42.043
- There are a lot of things to consider.
- Hey, we got great news, too.

18:42.087 --> 18:44.248
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.122
- No, it's not nothing. It's something.
- Come on, what is it?

18:47.159 --> 18:49.093
We're gonna get a place in the city.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.561
Yay!

18:54.500 --> 18:56.934
I think that's great. Great news.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.227
I'm gonna go wash dishes.

19:02.074 --> 19:05.669
Why did you say anything?
We don't know if we're taking it yet.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.144
Betty might stay.

19:07.179 --> 19:08.771
I thought it was a good time
to test the waters.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.908
- Hilda, it's okay.
- No. It's not okay.

19:11.950 --> 19:15.784
And you don't tell me what is okay
and what isn't okay, okay?

19:16.588 --> 19:18.021
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:23.262 --> 19:24.490
Hi.

19:24.530 --> 19:28.591
I'm sorry. I am sorry. It's not you, okay?
I just...

19:29.268 --> 19:32.601
Look, I'm so happy for you.

19:32.638 --> 19:36.165
You're living your dream
and I am so proud of you.

19:37.109 --> 19:41.341
I just feel like I finally have a chance
at living my dream,

19:42.548 --> 19:45.574
the happy family life
that I've always wanted,

19:46.018 --> 19:47.383
and I can't do it.

19:47.953 --> 19:51.912
<i>I mean, how's Papi gonna feel
if we both leave him alone?</i>

19:56.762 --> 19:58.059
I don't know.

19:58.463 --> 20:01.023
<i>I don't know how Papi is gonna feel,</i>

20:01.500 --> 20:04.663
but if you want that place, get it.

20:07.172 --> 20:11.268
- Yeah?
- Hilda, you deserve to be happy.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.385
Rouge alert! Rouge alert!

20:26.425 --> 20:30.327
<i>Our sources have just confirmed that
Wilhelmina Slater is en route to Mode,</i>

20:30.362 --> 20:34.025
where she will be publicly speaking
about her shooting for the first time.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.829
Who shot the Diabolical Diva?

20:35.867 --> 20:39.030
And what gorgeous piece of couture
did they blast a hole through?

20:39.071 --> 20:43.167
Stick with me because Wilhelmina
always tells Suzuki first.

20:44.309 --> 20:47.642
- Willie. Willie, Suzuks here.
- Out of my way, clown.

20:48.547 --> 20:49.707
Cut!

20:50.048 --> 20:53.074
Thank you all for meeting me here.
I have a brief statement

20:53.118 --> 20:55.416
and then I'd like to get back
to my office.

20:55.454 --> 20:59.823
As you can imagine, work really
piles up when you're in a coma.

20:59.858 --> 21:03.385
There's been some speculation as to
what happened the night I was shot,

21:03.428 --> 21:04.986
and I...

21:07.466 --> 21:10.367
And I'd like to put the rumors to rest.

21:10.736 --> 21:13.068
Let the truth speak for itself.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.667
It was not Claire Meade who shot me,

21:18.377 --> 21:21.505
although it's obvious
why people would think so.

21:22.681 --> 21:23.978
It was...

21:33.425 --> 21:34.653
It was me.

21:36.928 --> 21:40.261
I was cleaning my gun
and I shot myself by accident.

21:41.266 --> 21:44.929
So sorry to disappoint,
but there was no drama that night.

21:45.537 --> 21:46.629
Just

21:48.440 --> 21:50.135
a foolish mistake.

21:57.249 --> 21:59.945
Well, thank you for an informative day.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.454
That was a complete waste of time.

22:03.789 --> 22:07.384
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but thank you.

22:07.426 --> 22:10.554
- Don't thank me, I didn't do it for you.
- Right.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.056
Forgive me for saying so,

22:14.099 --> 22:17.466
but why do I feel
like I'm going to pay for this one day?

22:17.502 --> 22:21.063
Because you don't know me.
So, go ahead and unclench everything.

22:21.106 --> 22:22.334
We're good.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.376
Well, as good as you and I can be.

22:27.045 --> 22:29.275
- Really?
- Yes, really, Claire.

22:43.628 --> 22:45.994
- Chamomile?
- Thank you.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.863
Justin, I don't know what to do.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.566
If I go to London, am I being selfish?

22:56.842 --> 22:59.504
I feel like I'm letting everyone down.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.513
<i>Papi, Daniel, Hilda.</i>

23:04.649 --> 23:07.846
- Not to mention, it's such a risk...
- Aunt Betty,

23:08.720 --> 23:10.347
you're all about risk.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.291
<i>You took a job at Mode magazine.</i>

23:15.293 --> 23:18.626
You showed up to your first day of work
in a poncho.

23:18.964 --> 23:21.364
That reeked of disaster.

23:22.968 --> 23:24.026
But

23:25.637 --> 23:27.332
you became a star.

23:28.673 --> 23:30.504
And it's not selfish.

23:31.209 --> 23:35.145
It helps, kind of, to see you be so brave.

23:37.215 --> 23:41.174
You know, it sort of raises the bar
for the rest of us.

23:44.189 --> 23:48.091
Not to mention,
I get to visit my cool aunt in London.

23:50.796 --> 23:52.821
How did you get so smart?

23:54.232 --> 23:56.291
I had a few good teachers.

24:12.751 --> 24:13.843
Hey.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.487
You're leaving, aren't you?

24:32.103 --> 24:37.803
Do you have another copy
of that paper you wanted me to sign?

25:08.907 --> 25:10.340
Are we good?

25:11.476 --> 25:12.875
We're good.

25:17.782 --> 25:20.580
- Daniel...
- I'm supposed to be at a meeting

25:20.619 --> 25:21.984
right now.

25:23.588 --> 25:27.046
So, why don't we talk later?

25:43.074 --> 25:46.771
Betty, this is such a great party.

25:46.811 --> 25:49.780
And thank you so much
for making it a farewell to Halston.

25:49.814 --> 25:52.510
Yeah. That was a surprise.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.314
- It's just so perfect.
- Good luck, Betty. Bye.

25:54.352 --> 25:58.516
<i>Finally realizing
where he belongs. Mode.</i>

25:58.590 --> 25:59.921
Aw!

26:03.695 --> 26:04.719
Mmm.

26:08.466 --> 26:11.765
Mrs. Meade, I'm so glad you came.

26:11.803 --> 26:15.170
Betty, I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

26:15.206 --> 26:17.003
I'm so proud of you.

26:17.842 --> 26:19.207
Thank you.

26:20.345 --> 26:23.041
- Do you think Daniel's coming?
- I don't know.

26:24.749 --> 26:27.081
He's been avoiding me for days.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.881
- I think he hates me now.
- He doesn't.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.920
Losing you is very hard for him, Betty.

26:35.727 --> 26:38.560
I don't even think he knows
quite why yet.

26:39.197 --> 26:40.721
What do you mean?

26:41.533 --> 26:42.966
I have a theory.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.229
What?

26:49.608 --> 26:52.634
Really? No. No. No.

27:03.421 --> 27:04.911
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.390
This is fun.
I'm really glad I got to come.

27:07.425 --> 27:10.724
Well, you were an intern here.
You're a Modie, too.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.325
Why don't you
go dance with him?

27:14.366 --> 27:15.424
Oh.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.833
- Come on, you know you want to.
- He's got a boyfriend.

27:17.869 --> 27:21.930
That guy? Reeks of rebound.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.900
I don't think that's gonna work out.

27:25.510 --> 27:26.841
Oh, what do you know?

27:26.878 --> 27:29.813
You're recently hatched
from the gay egg.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.713
You still have a lot to learn
about relationships.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.115
So do you.

28:08.553 --> 28:10.578
Look out, skinny bitches!

28:11.089 --> 28:12.886
I don't care who sits here.

28:12.924 --> 28:16.155
This big, orange donut
will always be mine!

28:17.128 --> 28:18.652
And Halston's.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.363
Oh. Hi.

28:27.505 --> 28:29.268
You made it.

28:29.307 --> 28:33.334
Of course.
I couldn't miss that pooch's farewell.

28:33.978 --> 28:36.446
I didn't realize you knew Betty.

28:36.481 --> 28:38.642
I was talking about Halston.

28:38.683 --> 28:39.775
Oh.

28:40.085 --> 28:42.280
Right.

28:43.988 --> 28:46.786
Daniel, this is Betty.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.429
It's my going-away party
and you're not here.

28:52.297 --> 28:55.198
I was just wondering
if you're gonna come.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.700
I really hope that I get to see you
before I leave.

29:00.772 --> 29:02.137
Okay, bye.

29:02.607 --> 29:05.701
You know,
you do work for two Editors-in-Chief.

29:07.178 --> 29:10.545
I have to find out you're leaving
through a mass e-mail?

29:10.582 --> 29:12.846
You never asked my permission.

29:15.186 --> 29:18.587
- Permission granted.
- Thank you.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.726
It's interesting.
You've spent four years of your life

29:21.760 --> 29:26.197
working your way up the ladder here
and now you're throwing it all away.

29:28.366 --> 29:31.460
- Yeah, I just...
- I never thought I'd say this,

29:32.270 --> 29:35.000
but you've got big balls, Betty Suarez.

29:40.745 --> 29:43.839
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

29:48.920 --> 29:52.117
I don't know why I got so competitive
with Ellen.

29:52.423 --> 29:54.948
She wore the hell out of that suit.

29:55.493 --> 29:57.154
Spencer, I have something to tell you

29:57.195 --> 29:59.993
and I'm really worried
about how you're gonna react.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.693
- I know you're my daughter.
- What? How?

30:03.568 --> 30:07.868
I recently found out from a friend
that Fey got pregnant

30:08.273 --> 30:11.640
shortly after I was with her.

30:11.676 --> 30:14.338
It was the '80s, Studio 54.

30:14.379 --> 30:17.906
I got so blitzed out of my mind
I thought Fey was Andy Warhol.

30:18.416 --> 30:21.408
I contacted an agency to find you.

30:22.086 --> 30:28.423
And then I hired you as my stylist
so I could get to know you first.

30:29.694 --> 30:32.458
I wanted to make sure
I wasn't intruding.

30:34.065 --> 30:35.259
It's okay.

30:36.434 --> 30:37.662
Really?

30:37.702 --> 30:41.001
Really. I've been waiting years
for you to intrude.

30:42.774 --> 30:45.800
Well, then, I forbid you to see that boy.

30:46.277 --> 30:47.767
Wait, what boy?
What are you talking about?

30:47.812 --> 30:50.747
I don't know, it just sounded
like a fatherly thing to say.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.613
Then I hate you, Dad.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.857
- Marc.
- Yeah?

31:02.894 --> 31:04.885
- Got you!
- Oh. Yes.

31:07.165 --> 31:08.928
I'm gonna miss you.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.029
I know.

31:11.936 --> 31:13.961
And you're gonna miss me.

31:14.005 --> 31:15.302
Hmm...

31:17.508 --> 31:19.408
Take care of everything here.

31:26.684 --> 31:28.515
- I love this song!
- Me, too!

31:28.553 --> 31:30.020
Me three!

31:51.876 --> 31:54.106
Are you going to talk to her?

31:58.616 --> 32:00.846
I think I need to let her go.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.519
- What?
- Go to the marked tabs.

32:50.268 --> 32:52.293
Those will be your pages to fill.

32:52.337 --> 32:55.238
<i>You're now sole Editor-in-Chief
of Mode.</i>

32:55.273 --> 32:57.503
I'm stepping down. It's time.

32:59.344 --> 33:03.337
I got this job because it was
handed to me, but you've earned it.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.743
Well, this is quite a surprise.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.084
How does Claire feel about it?

33:11.889 --> 33:14.050
She's given it her blessing.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.320
Congratulations, Wilhelmina.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.391
And what are you gonna do?

33:24.035 --> 33:25.866
I'm gonna start over.

33:40.818 --> 33:44.549
Okay, everybody, gather round.
I'd like to make a toast.

33:44.589 --> 33:46.819
This is gonna be his last attempt
to make you stay.

33:46.858 --> 33:51.090
I just want to say, I know I can't stop
my daughters from leaving,

33:51.129 --> 33:53.689
but I can give them a little advice.

33:54.399 --> 33:57.664
Betty, you're moving across an ocean

33:58.603 --> 34:01.333
where you'll have no family, no friends.

34:02.106 --> 34:04.574
<i>- You won't know the city.
- Papi...</i>

34:04.609 --> 34:07.134
<i>I know what that's like, mi hija.</i>

34:07.178 --> 34:10.409
When your mommy and I left Mexico
and came here,

34:12.283 --> 34:13.978
we were so afraid.

34:15.453 --> 34:18.684
But it was the best decision we made
in our lives.

34:20.158 --> 34:25.322
Something tells me you'll look back
and think the same about this move.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.391
<i>Thank you, Papi.</i>

34:32.235 --> 34:33.293
Next.

34:33.337 --> 34:35.771
No, stop. No advice.
I got to tell you something.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.638
<i>- Wait.
- No, Papi, me first.</i>

34:37.675 --> 34:40.667
My advice is that you're very stubborn
and you don't listen.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.552
- We're moving to Manhattan.
- And there's plenty of room.

34:48.585 --> 34:50.645
Yeah. We want you to come
and live with us.

34:50.688 --> 34:51.813
Yeah.

34:53.357 --> 34:58.727
That's very sweet. I appreciate it,
but I'm not going anywhere.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.793
We're not gonna
let you live here alone.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.993
I want to live here alone.

35:03.034 --> 35:05.025
Don't you think I'm a little tired of
sharing one bathroom

35:05.069 --> 35:06.764
with the three of you?

35:06.804 --> 35:08.738
Believe me,
my bladder isn't what it used to be.

35:08.806 --> 35:13.402
Oh, come on, I thought we were
gonna have an elegant lunch, but...

35:13.444 --> 35:18.507
I want my daughters and my grandson
to live their lives the way they want.

35:31.195 --> 35:36.132
I heard congratulations were in order
and I wanted to be one of the first.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.727
Thank you. You are the first, indeed.

35:38.769 --> 35:43.399
You can put the flowers anywhere.
You always seem to know what's right.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.183
- Okay, well...
- Not so fast.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.421
<i>Now that Mode is mine,</i>

35:59.157 --> 36:01.921
I'm going to be doing
some housecleaning,

36:02.260 --> 36:05.855
- getting rid of some of the fat.
- But Betty already left.

36:11.536 --> 36:13.970
You know, I really am gonna miss her.

36:14.472 --> 36:20.411
Anyway, I might need
to lean on you a little more, creatively,

36:20.945 --> 36:24.381
- if you feel you're up to it.
- Yes. Sure.

36:24.549 --> 36:25.573
Um...

36:26.717 --> 36:29.345
I'm happy to be leaned on creatively.

36:29.820 --> 36:30.946
Good.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.816
But no more schemes, right?

36:34.458 --> 36:35.584
Well,

36:36.961 --> 36:39.156
there is just one.

36:47.738 --> 36:51.834
I pulled some strings with the senator
and got you a new cellmate.

36:52.343 --> 36:54.038
A fairly high-profile type.

36:54.078 --> 36:58.742
And why does this high-profile prisoner
put such a twinkle in your eye?

36:58.783 --> 37:02.617
Well, the Feds are hoping to extract
a confession out of him.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.416
Now, someone
who could sweet-talk a guard

37:05.456 --> 37:09.187
into letting him out of prison
to visit his girlfriend

37:09.227 --> 37:10.922
might get him to talk.

37:10.962 --> 37:17.561
And if so, that person could suddenly
find his sentence drastically reduced.

37:19.003 --> 37:23.838
Well, I think this guy
is going to find me

37:24.775 --> 37:26.572
very hard to resist.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.212
I couldn't agree more.

37:34.051 --> 37:35.211
Okay.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.612
- First, we have a surprise.
- What are you... What are you doing?

37:38.656 --> 37:41.648
You cannot go to Europe in those, so...

37:45.296 --> 37:47.161
Nice.
- Okay, can I take mine, too?

37:47.198 --> 37:48.756
- No.
- Come on...

37:51.302 --> 37:52.496
Okay.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.962
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

37:57.508 --> 37:59.271
You're gonna come
visit me soon, right?

37:59.310 --> 38:02.279
Yeah. Summer can't come
soon enough.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.515
I love you.

38:08.519 --> 38:09.781
Be safe.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.923
You're gonna be great, Chipmunk,
all right?

38:16.961 --> 38:19.896
Okay. Be good, Austin.

38:30.074 --> 38:31.632
<i>Love you, Papi.</i>

38:35.112 --> 38:38.604
Okay, okay.
I will call you as soon as I land.

38:38.649 --> 38:39.707
It might be very early,

38:39.750 --> 38:41.809
so just wait until you wake up
and call me back, okay?

38:41.852 --> 38:42.978
We will.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.039
Hi!

40:15.179 --> 40:16.703
- Betty?
- Oh, sorry.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.311
Daniel.

40:21.485 --> 40:24.215
- So, was that hard for you?
- Not really.

40:24.889 --> 40:29.087
Just, I realized I've had
everything handed to me.

40:29.393 --> 40:31.793
I've never really gotten anything
on my own.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.490
Like you.

40:35.633 --> 40:38.898
Well, I know there's a lot
you can do, Daniel.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.735
Thank you.

40:41.639 --> 40:45.040
And I also realized
I didn't say goodbye,

40:45.075 --> 40:48.101
which is really not cool.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.671
So, goodbye.

40:51.749 --> 40:53.273
And good luck.

40:54.051 --> 40:56.451
And have a safe flight.

40:56.487 --> 40:59.354
Thank you. I'll call you when I get there.

41:02.092 --> 41:03.218
So...

41:05.229 --> 41:08.255
So that's it?
You're headed back to New York?

41:10.868 --> 41:15.237
No, I think I'm gonna stay around here
for a while.

41:15.739 --> 41:19.300
See what I can find.
Maybe take you to dinner.

41:20.277 --> 41:22.074
Tonight, if you're free.

41:23.681 --> 41:25.376
I would love that.

41:30.087 --> 41:32.555
Well, I'd better get back to work.

41:34.291 --> 41:36.452
I'm really glad you're here.

41:39.196 --> 41:42.029
- I'll call you later.
- Great.

41:43.367 --> 41:47.804
Hey, if you want something to do,
I am looking for a new assistant.

41:47.838 --> 41:50.500
Well, maybe I'll submit my résumé.
