WEBVTT

00:08.050 --> 00:09.670
Previously on Cloak and Dagger...

00:09.690 --> 00:10.766
We're just taking back what's ours.

00:10.790 --> 00:12.056
- Tyrone?
- Duane?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.760
- Look at you!
- So you own this place?

00:13.800 --> 00:15.499
What if you could get
Connors on something else?

00:15.500 --> 00:16.500
Like dealing drugs?

00:16.510 --> 00:18.139
He cleared the field for

00:18.140 --> 00:19.979
a mystery dealer to play monopoly.

00:19.980 --> 00:21.900
I don't work for you. We're partners.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.576
Partner is not the word
you're looking for!

00:23.600 --> 00:25.320
Not after the night you shot my boy.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.650
ROXXON is placing the blame

00:26.670 --> 00:28.900
of the oil rig explosion on Nathan.

00:28.940 --> 00:31.060
I've been looking at
my dad's old papers.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.439
Trying to connect the dots.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.780
My name is Mina Hess,

00:33.810 --> 00:35.979
and I'm working with ROXXON Gulf

00:35.980 --> 00:37.080
to save the world.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.700
So, we're doing a reading?

00:46.200 --> 00:48.460
How go things with that boy of yours?

00:48.540 --> 00:50.940
- He's not mine.
- He's yours enough.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.220
Is this your way of having "the talk?"

00:53.280 --> 00:54.940
Cause you're kinda predicting the past.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.140
This reading ain't for you.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.510
It's for this city of ours.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.019
So, what's wrong with the city?

01:05.580 --> 01:07.680
Shit goes down from time to time.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.520
And why do you need me?

01:12.550 --> 01:14.520
I ain't smellin' sex on you,

01:14.980 --> 01:16.780
but a connection to a power.

01:17.180 --> 01:18.720
The power I felt in that boy.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.560
What does Tyrone have
to do with anything?

01:20.590 --> 01:22.040
I don't know yet.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.980
That's what the reading is for.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.720
First, we look at the past.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.820
Then, the present.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.440
And if the Loa are with us today,

01:33.620 --> 01:35.570
we'll see...

01:36.820 --> 01:37.920
the future.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.690
Oui.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.160
Sorry I'm late.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.180
Merci.

02:35.260 --> 02:37.880
Uh... Miss Hess?

02:40.040 --> 02:41.360
You on a field trip or something?

02:42.220 --> 02:43.540
No.

02:43.570 --> 02:45.320
No, I'm Liz. Your new intern?

02:45.490 --> 02:46.590
I didn't ask for an intern.

02:46.630 --> 02:49.100
- But Mr. Caruthers said...
- Caruthers?

02:51.570 --> 02:53.000
Yeah, okay. I get it now.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.480
Oh my God. Is this not a thing?

02:56.640 --> 02:58.800
I didn't ask for an intern. Sorry.

02:58.980 --> 03:00.599
I just saw you speak and I got really

03:00.600 --> 03:02.040
excited to learn from you, and...

03:04.250 --> 03:06.180
You know what, wow, I...

03:06.250 --> 03:07.880
I'm sorry to waste your time.

03:09.350 --> 03:10.940
You're gonna need waders.

03:13.980 --> 03:15.560
The good kind.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.560
Never cheap out on waders.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.920
And pick up some heat-resistant gloves,

03:19.940 --> 03:21.440
goggles, snake-repellent,

03:21.450 --> 03:23.820
mosquito hat, two feet
of netting, bug spray.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.350
... that's just leaving
money on the table.

03:32.370 --> 03:34.420
I'll replace your ass if I
hear you skipping clubs again.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.340
Spot in the quarter first, then uptown.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.360
Make sure your count and
your product is right.

03:38.460 --> 03:39.639
Keep your head on,

03:39.640 --> 03:41.139
and don't go visit your
little girlfriends.

03:41.140 --> 03:43.020
I got it, yo.

03:46.350 --> 03:47.830
What you doin' back here, little man?

03:49.190 --> 03:50.500
Wanted to see about a job.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.000
You want to fix houses?

03:52.060 --> 03:53.230
I wanna work with you.

03:53.780 --> 03:55.500
Got no openings. Sorry.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.500
Look, I could really use something

03:58.530 --> 04:00.270
after that game.

04:02.170 --> 04:03.340
I feel you.

04:03.370 --> 04:04.760
Tough break about State.

04:05.020 --> 04:06.440
I been there.

04:06.470 --> 04:08.860
But you played with heart.
That's what counts, right?

04:08.940 --> 04:11.400
Doesn't change what happened.
That was my last game.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.180
I don't know, I'm just wondering

04:14.220 --> 04:15.660
if I chose the wrong path, you know?

04:15.980 --> 04:18.180
If I should find something else to do.

04:18.220 --> 04:19.880
You don't want to do what I do.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.440
You're smart. You could
work in an office.

04:22.460 --> 04:24.420
No, man, I wanna be here.

04:24.460 --> 04:25.479
Back in the Ward.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.880
Boy, most folks just
trying to get outta here.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.700
What if I never left?

04:30.840 --> 04:33.800
What if that night had
gone any other way?

04:34.120 --> 04:35.430
What night?

04:36.470 --> 04:38.200
The night Billy died.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.660
What if...

04:44.080 --> 04:46.250
What if there was some
other life I could've had?

04:47.550 --> 04:49.060
Come on, man.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.500
You headed to college.

04:50.580 --> 04:52.220
Bet you got some
cheerleader just waiting

04:52.250 --> 04:53.770
to take all your troubles away, right?

04:55.660 --> 04:58.000
Yeah, right! Don't take it all so hard.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.740
You gonna find the right path for you.

05:00.380 --> 05:01.380
I know it.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.000
I gotta get back to it.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.000
You stand tall, young brother.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.240
I noticed a lot of birds flipped today.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.860
Been bird watching.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.660
Yeah, making friends.
Influencing people.

05:51.740 --> 05:53.280
Not asking questions has been my thing

05:53.310 --> 05:55.360
because you've made it clear
that you don't want them asked.

05:55.380 --> 05:56.599
And I like that about you.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.120
Be prepared to like me less.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.190
People in this city
have turned a blind eye

06:01.220 --> 06:03.400
and a deaf ear to things
out of convenience.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.406
And the people in this station
house are people too,

06:05.430 --> 06:08.090
but you are forcing
them to pay attention.

06:08.130 --> 06:09.460
That's kinda the point.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.446
I know you know whose attention
you're coming after,

06:11.470 --> 06:12.740
- and I...
- And what?

06:12.780 --> 06:14.340
- You reckon it won't work?
- No.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.280
I'm concerned that it might.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.799
Connors is flammable.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.800
Don't play with fire, okay?

06:38.390 --> 06:41.190
Yo! What you think you doing?!

06:41.230 --> 06:42.880
You better watch yourself.

06:43.230 --> 06:45.160
Unless you wanna step to right now.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.600
No, I'm good.

06:46.630 --> 06:48.580
I best not see you again.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.069
The past of New Orleans
is a roller coaster

06:57.070 --> 06:59.100
of destruction and rebirth.

06:59.130 --> 07:01.600
Natural cycles we live and die by.

07:01.940 --> 07:03.660
What do you mean? Like
another hurricane?

07:03.740 --> 07:05.000
In some cycles.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.910
In others, fire.

07:06.940 --> 07:08.460
Famine, disease.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.500
War.

07:10.050 --> 07:12.860
We're a goodie bag of
bad oogie down here.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.100
And you think some kinda
disaster's coming?

07:15.140 --> 07:16.150
I do.

07:16.180 --> 07:17.719
But I think we gotta understand

07:17.720 --> 07:18.980
the past to get an eye on it.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.940
What does this have to do with Ty?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.520
Do you know the stories I told you?

07:24.620 --> 07:26.340
The other ones lying on the shelf?

07:27.030 --> 07:28.199
You know I do.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.250
Even when I tell 'em on the tour,

07:29.260 --> 07:30.700
that's when everybody leans in.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.300
I think it's time we lean in ourselves.

07:33.330 --> 07:35.619
Get an eye on what the
next story's gonna be,

07:35.620 --> 07:36.960
'cause I got an itch.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.760
And it's telling me that
story may be your man's.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.360
So now we're visiting each other.

08:05.370 --> 08:07.640
So now we're wearing rubber pants?

08:07.760 --> 08:09.220
Judge less or leave more.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.620
Pretty dope how you pulled that off.

08:19.050 --> 08:20.380
How's your thing going?

08:20.680 --> 08:21.920
It's not.

08:22.780 --> 08:25.460
I was following this kid and
he pointed a gun at me.

08:26.190 --> 08:28.310
I mean, I should have just
blipped away, but I didn't.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.090
What kid?

08:30.130 --> 08:32.559
This drug runner for an old
friend of my brother's.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.340
Duane. He's got some
upper hand over Connors.

08:35.419 --> 08:37.700
Well, did you try and con Duane first?

08:37.840 --> 08:39.570
Yeah, I asked him for a job

08:39.580 --> 08:41.970
so I could bust Connors from the inside.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.070
- And?
- No openings.

08:44.110 --> 08:46.310
Sometimes you gotta create openings.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.040
This kid.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.600
How old was he?

08:50.040 --> 08:51.340
Like my age.

08:51.380 --> 08:52.920
I don't know.

08:53.380 --> 08:54.740
You could be him.

08:54.820 --> 08:57.080
What? Deal drugs for Duane?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.090
Might be a cool look on you.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.120
I mean, look at me.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.200
I'm a ROXXON intern.

09:04.130 --> 09:06.300
- For real?
- For fake for real.

09:07.060 --> 09:09.110
I'm going swamping to
get close to this girl

09:09.120 --> 09:10.960
whose dad survived the rig explosion.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.960
- Swamping?
- She's an environmental scientist.

09:15.970 --> 09:17.420
Her dad worked with my dad.

09:17.970 --> 09:19.620
You can be like her as well.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.780
Sure, in another, better, life.

09:22.940 --> 09:24.920
Maybe you'll make a friend.

09:25.050 --> 09:27.480
She's not my friend. She's my mark.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.980
Are you gonna do your hope thing on her?

09:30.020 --> 09:31.950
Use what you got, right?

09:31.990 --> 09:33.340
You can too.

09:33.460 --> 09:34.560
I can what?

09:34.660 --> 09:36.480
Use people's nightmares against them.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.379
Hey, maybe you can get some leverage

09:38.380 --> 09:39.990
on this kid with the gun.

09:40.030 --> 09:41.060
Steal his job.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.320
Guess we're both up for different lives.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.460
The further adventures of the
scientist and the criminal.

10:30.350 --> 10:32.700
Hello? Miss Hess?

10:35.160 --> 10:37.660
Hey! Come on up here and science!

10:37.700 --> 10:39.040
Okey dokey.

10:43.190 --> 10:45.700
Nice! You got the good waders.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.290
Did you save your receipts?

10:48.330 --> 10:49.740
Yep.

10:49.780 --> 10:50.860
Hold on.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.640
- Uh, Miss Hess?
- Mina.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.960
Mina.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.980
Uh, what's up with all these blueprints?

11:10.020 --> 11:11.740
Did you design the new ROXXON building?

11:11.760 --> 11:13.120
No.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.390
I just made the building green.

11:15.980 --> 11:19.500
No one approved a poop chute
to a company compost pile.

11:19.620 --> 11:21.520
What a waste.

11:30.660 --> 11:32.040
Cookie?

11:36.180 --> 11:37.340
Wow.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.939
What gives it that snap?

11:38.940 --> 11:40.460
My secret ingredient.

11:40.620 --> 11:43.140
Cardamom. Natural antidepressant.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.820
Hey, that's the, um,
that's the oil rig, right?

11:46.040 --> 11:47.580
The one from eight years ago?

11:48.020 --> 11:49.700
The one that went...

11:50.960 --> 11:53.130
Um, yes.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.130
But seriously, these cookies
took so long to get right.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.030
ROXXON's resident genius
had trouble baking?

11:59.070 --> 12:01.100
My new oven is a fickle beast.

12:01.140 --> 12:02.480
Burnt everything.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.240
Then I re-calibrated the
thermostat and now...

12:05.540 --> 12:07.070
yummers.

12:07.110 --> 12:08.719
Cookies are tricky like that.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.280
They really are.

12:10.310 --> 12:11.980
Well, you ready to get to work?

12:12.010 --> 12:14.020
Time to go spot check the equipment.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.380
Hope you like mud.

12:34.780 --> 12:37.760
Anybody ever tell you that
you work too hard, O'Reilly?

12:37.780 --> 12:39.110
Yes.

12:39.140 --> 12:40.580
But I never listen to them.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.880
Well, there's another
thing we have in common.

12:44.010 --> 12:46.740
So, what's up? Looks like
you're on to something there.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.380
Yeah, that club dealer the other night.

12:48.420 --> 12:50.740
She mentioned that she's
never met her boss.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.150
Which got me thinking, "How the
hell does he stay so insulated?"

12:54.190 --> 12:55.880
Maybe he's just smart.

12:55.980 --> 12:57.360
Keeps himself removed.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.160
That's what I would do.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.200
Me, too.

13:03.230 --> 13:04.880
But if you dig around enough,

13:04.900 --> 13:06.660
certain patterns point
in certain directions.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.170
That one club girl gave you all this?

13:09.200 --> 13:11.200
No, I think she skipped town,

13:11.240 --> 13:14.370
but I found five others
working different spots.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.110
Then I followed them back to
the next line in the chain.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.579
What have we got here? The errand boys.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.900
But I can't seem to track
them to a central location.

13:21.940 --> 13:23.250
They criss-cross the city,

13:23.280 --> 13:25.480
and I keep losing them in
this area of the district.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.780
You in the mood for company today?

13:32.460 --> 13:34.180
Are you offering to help?

13:34.460 --> 13:36.640
I used to stomp those grounds.

13:37.230 --> 13:39.640
Sure, but I'm driving.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.330
The present is daunting.

13:53.660 --> 13:56.030
We never step in the same river twice.

13:56.070 --> 13:58.180
But if we understand the past,

13:58.260 --> 13:59.940
we understand the cycle.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.860
And know what to look for in the now.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.800
What do these stories of old tell you

14:05.840 --> 14:07.800
about what might come anew?

14:08.080 --> 14:10.340
Through famine with the
basket boy and girl.

14:10.660 --> 14:12.960
Feud with the brothers Wilson.

14:13.180 --> 14:15.900
Through war and disease, it
always came down to two people.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.400
The divine paring.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.990
If Ty were one of them,

14:20.020 --> 14:21.620
one of the pair...

14:22.920 --> 14:24.560
Who's the other?

14:38.040 --> 14:41.580
So, your dad, does he
still work for ROXXON?

14:44.740 --> 14:47.140
Are you looking for something?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.250
Bee Arthur.

14:49.290 --> 14:50.990
The Golden Girl?

14:51.020 --> 14:52.700
The American bumblebee.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.680
There used to be one every ten feet.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.260
There.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.440
There.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.440
There.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.820
Every marsh orchid,
there was Bee Arthur.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.000
Then one day, they were just gone.

15:11.140 --> 15:13.380
Sounds like Colony Collapse Disorder.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.180
What's that?

15:16.250 --> 15:19.010
The phenomenon where bees in a colony

15:19.050 --> 15:20.720
suddenly disappear, and...

15:20.840 --> 15:22.700
leave behind only a queen.

15:22.860 --> 15:24.020
Like magic.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.950
No magic.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.780
Just science we don't understand.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.780
You heard this theory that...

15:30.990 --> 15:34.240
bees' navigation memory is
disrupted by pesticides?

15:34.780 --> 15:36.160
They go out foraging

15:36.200 --> 15:38.600
and get hit with all these chemicals.

15:38.820 --> 15:40.600
And they can't find their way back home.

15:42.310 --> 15:44.420
Well, someone read my Master's thesis.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.370
"What's Colony Collapse Disorder?"

15:46.410 --> 15:47.940
Shut up.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.380
You passed the test.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.640
I'm glad you're looking for that bee.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.700
When we stop looking for something,

15:56.840 --> 15:59.020
that's when we let it disappear, right?

16:03.090 --> 16:04.460
I'll look, too.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.540
65 million years ago,

16:11.560 --> 16:12.880
there was a mass extinction of bees

16:12.900 --> 16:14.970
like the one happening now.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Then the asteroid that
wiped the dinosaurs hit,

16:17.040 --> 16:18.540
but guess what.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.600
Bees came back?

16:19.620 --> 16:21.110
Hells yeah, they did.

16:21.140 --> 16:24.040
They're like the New Orleans of insects.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.540
Because why?

16:27.150 --> 16:28.320
Bees survive.

16:28.740 --> 16:30.320
Right.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.900
This is an impossible city.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.290
One disaster after the next.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.780
New Orleans always comes back.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.120
I love it so much.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.500
Yeah, it's a pretty sweet place.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.070
There's something pretty
special underneath it, too.

16:52.110 --> 16:54.010
- What?
- I'll show you.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.619
So that girl you took off?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.060
Needed a fix, huh?

17:08.119 --> 17:09.920
Don't make me sound like a junkie.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.339
Sometimes it just feels good.

17:13.060 --> 17:15.180
But the cop in you got curious.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.130
Decided to follow the supply chain.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.970
They're still selling drugs to kids.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.420
A free bump doesn't mean
I'm giving them a free ride.

17:28.410 --> 17:31.110
Maybe I'll just pick up the runners,

17:31.150 --> 17:32.360
squeeze one for info.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.560
You know the key to this stuff?

17:36.700 --> 17:38.840
To getting inside someone else's mind?

17:39.460 --> 17:41.420
Thinking like them?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.760
Seeing the world the way they do.

17:44.460 --> 17:47.960
That way you can predict
what they're gonna do.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.600
You giving me lessons now?

17:51.230 --> 17:52.840
I'm just saying.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.659
You start thinking like the other guy,

17:54.660 --> 17:55.960
you live a little longer.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.140
Or you start thinking
like the other guy,

17:58.170 --> 18:00.380
then you might slowly become him.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.320
Pull over here. Now.

18:08.380 --> 18:11.120
- Stay right there!
- Bag! He had a bag!

18:43.200 --> 18:44.800
We could have driven here.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.720
Well, yeah. We could've.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.960
I'm so excited to show you my valve.

18:49.990 --> 18:52.300
I'm excited to see your valve.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.720
Is it a part of the new rig?

18:54.780 --> 18:56.179
Rigs are the shotgunned beer

18:56.180 --> 18:57.750
of natural resource extraction.

18:57.780 --> 19:00.690
My valve is part of a complex
and thoughtful system

19:00.700 --> 19:01.900
connected to a new drill.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.300
One that respects nature.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.900
So what happened last time,
doesn't happen again.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.240
How do you know it won't?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.699
Because I fixed it.

19:08.700 --> 19:10.900
I mean, no one knew how hot
this stuff was gonna be.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.380
No one except Nathan Bowen
and my dad, of course.

19:14.180 --> 19:15.800
It took everyone by surprise.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.060
Really? Well, how hot does oil burn?

19:19.540 --> 19:22.040
Caruthers had you sign an NDA, right?

19:22.060 --> 19:23.179
Yeah.

19:23.180 --> 19:25.440
Yeah, and the NDA about the NDA.

19:26.740 --> 19:28.580
We aren't drilling for oil.

19:29.530 --> 19:30.600
What then?

19:30.630 --> 19:32.646
I won't be able to run tests
until we start pumping,

19:32.670 --> 19:35.540
but my dad said it burned
ten times better than oil.

19:35.650 --> 19:37.420
And it's twice as hot.

19:37.460 --> 19:39.240
Pumps in the old rig couldn't handle it.

19:39.340 --> 19:42.430
Drill should have stopped,
but it didn't, and then...

19:42.460 --> 19:45.100
- Boom.
- Yeah.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.820
Cookies are tricky like that.

19:48.140 --> 19:49.580
Exactly.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.640
So, how'd you fix the oven?

19:51.670 --> 19:53.440
That's where my valves come in.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.680
I installed pressure release
points across the city.

19:55.860 --> 19:58.210
I added heat shields to
withstand the super hotness.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.460
It sounds like you thought a lot about

20:00.480 --> 20:02.160
what went wrong the first time.

20:02.650 --> 20:03.940
Every day.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.860
Your dad must be really proud.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.679
You're the only thing standing against

20:07.680 --> 20:09.640
ROXXON and a total meltdown.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.460
Well, someone's gotta make
lemonade out of assholes.

20:15.020 --> 20:17.460
I read this article back in the day.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.679
Said that Nathan Bowen was the one

20:18.680 --> 20:19.750
who caused the explosion.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.540
Some sort of miscalculation.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.479
My dad once said, "Nathan Bowen never

20:23.480 --> 20:25.260
made a miscalculation in his life."

20:31.000 --> 20:32.039
Hey, I...

20:32.040 --> 20:33.920
I think that guy's waving at you.

20:33.940 --> 20:36.019
That's Stan, the suit who lurks.

20:36.020 --> 20:38.180
Your heat shield? It's malfunctioning.

20:38.220 --> 20:39.659
I don't know what's wrong with it.

20:39.660 --> 20:41.500
Okay, I'll check on it.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.820
Stay here, Stan.

20:46.780 --> 20:48.430
Hey!

20:50.120 --> 20:52.120
What the hell, man? Why you sweating me?

20:52.530 --> 20:54.360
Dude! Have you lost your damn mind?

20:56.900 --> 20:59.740
You go back and you tell him
I said we need to meet.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.440
You tell him he's garnering
unwanted attention.

21:02.470 --> 21:03.539
And you tell him,

21:03.540 --> 21:05.539
this is about saving his ass.

21:05.540 --> 21:06.679
You hear me?

21:19.360 --> 21:20.700
O'Reilly, the bag.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.640
Someone else must've gotten to it.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.330
- You have a partner.
- I got nothing.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.020
And you got nothing,

21:31.030 --> 21:33.270
except some payback coming your way.

21:36.980 --> 21:38.710
Get out of my sight.

21:43.750 --> 21:46.320
I looked for it. I-I thought
I saw where it went.

21:47.980 --> 21:50.220
Whatever. Let's go.

21:53.530 --> 21:55.616
Looks like the heat shield
took on extra pressure.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.139
None of this makes sense.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.560
Are you sure it's in the right spot?

22:07.700 --> 22:09.100
What do you mean?

22:10.710 --> 22:13.410
Looks like the valve should
be ten meters thataway.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.120
Oh my God.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.140
Bless your eyeballs, yes.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.680
This is wrong.

22:20.350 --> 22:21.700
Stan.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.860
You only had to do one thing, Stan.

22:26.940 --> 22:29.230
- Put it where I said to.
- I did.

22:29.740 --> 22:31.600
You drilled into a shale bed.

22:31.630 --> 22:33.430
- It's a ten foot difference.
- Ten meters!

22:33.470 --> 22:35.156
There was so much pressure,
the pipe almost burst.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.239
We would've had to use a crane

22:36.240 --> 22:37.469
if we put it where you wanted.

22:37.470 --> 22:39.470
- So you're cutting corners?
- It was my call!

22:39.500 --> 22:40.800
It was a dumbass call.

22:40.820 --> 22:42.880
Scarborough's gonna hear about it.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.140
I'll come back with a crew tomorrow

22:45.150 --> 22:46.440
and re-install it myself.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.450
You can stay in the office with the A/C.

22:49.580 --> 22:52.119
Fine. Be a bitch about it.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.540
Gimme my bag!

23:26.580 --> 23:27.620
No!

23:37.660 --> 23:40.460
♪ A tisket, a tasket, ♪

23:40.500 --> 23:43.330

24:05.880 --> 24:06.960
Help!

24:21.310 --> 24:24.340
The future comes at us
like a freight train.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.250
With as much empathy for our wellbeing

24:26.280 --> 24:27.800
as a locomotive would have.

24:27.820 --> 24:29.480
There's no stopping what's coming at us?

24:29.520 --> 24:31.080
No slowing down the train?

24:31.140 --> 24:33.450
Energy builds, energy releases.

24:33.490 --> 24:35.240
There's no changing that.

24:35.780 --> 24:37.460
But once the wheel's turning...

24:39.060 --> 24:41.230
Only the divine pairing can stop it

24:41.260 --> 24:42.640
from crushing us all under it.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.940
Any idea as to when?

24:47.840 --> 24:49.440
It's hard to tell.

24:49.470 --> 24:50.740
But soon.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.410
I mean, every disaster
has a build up, right?

24:53.440 --> 24:55.380
They always talk about
a point of no return.

24:56.800 --> 24:59.740
There's always a point
of no return, darling.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.760
It's called the end.

25:04.450 --> 25:06.220
You lost the bag?

25:06.540 --> 25:09.260
On top of all the other shit I
gotta deal with, you lost the bag?

25:10.680 --> 25:12.160
You dumb...

25:14.330 --> 25:16.580
Ty, I don't have time for you right now.

25:18.270 --> 25:19.660
And what is this?

25:19.720 --> 25:21.430
Just something I found in the street.

25:21.470 --> 25:23.070
Thought I should grab it.

25:23.110 --> 25:24.540
And why would you bring it here?

25:24.570 --> 25:26.660
Your boy dropped it at the
first sign of the cops.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.020
I kinda figured you'd want it back.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.560
You know what's in there?

25:35.480 --> 25:37.920
Chris, grab that up, would you?

25:44.760 --> 25:47.080
So, you want a reward or something?

25:47.230 --> 25:48.580
I wanna do what you do.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.540
It's like that, huh?

25:53.170 --> 25:54.900
Do you know what I do?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.800
I mean, what I really do.

25:59.340 --> 26:00.740
You wanna learn?

26:01.280 --> 26:03.180
You ride with me today.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.920
We'll finish up Kev's run.

26:05.410 --> 26:07.640
See if you really want all this.

26:14.220 --> 26:16.000
That guy has no business out here.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.780
Stan's not like us. He doesn't care.

26:17.940 --> 26:19.770
Not to mention, he can't
read a blueprint.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.840
Where'd you learn how to read one?

26:22.920 --> 26:24.130
Um...

26:25.400 --> 26:27.540
there was this dad who visited my school

26:27.550 --> 26:28.940
when I was a little kid.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.640
He was all about making science fun.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.210
Potato light-bulbs,

26:35.240 --> 26:37.480
baking soda volcanoes.

26:37.510 --> 26:39.280
He brought these blueprints for rockets.

26:39.310 --> 26:40.660
and he let me keep one.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.040
Sounds like my dad.

26:42.120 --> 26:44.060
We tricked out an
Easy-Bake Oven together.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.440
He seems like he taught you a lot.

26:48.420 --> 26:50.020
Are you anything like him?

26:50.290 --> 26:52.380
We've got some of the same wiring.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.720
Feels like I'm more of a Nathan.

26:54.800 --> 26:57.380
- Is that a good thing?
- It's a great thing.

26:58.470 --> 27:01.500
My dad is a genius fluids engineer.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.840
He was the Mud Man.

27:02.940 --> 27:06.140
Working right down in the
rig with the other guys.

27:06.170 --> 27:09.120
Nathan was like Steve
Jobs to my dad's Wozniak.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.440
I heard he wanted to change the world.

27:15.660 --> 27:17.880
I still do.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.220
Can I talk to your dad sometime?

27:24.800 --> 27:27.380
I'd really like to get to
know more about Nathan Bowen.

27:28.820 --> 27:30.680
I-I don't think so.

27:37.210 --> 27:39.440
- Sorry for prying.
- Don't move.

27:41.580 --> 27:43.000
It's Bee Arthur.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.880
- What? There's a bee on me?
- Don't touch it.

27:45.380 --> 27:46.980
Trust me.

27:50.220 --> 27:51.300
Hi, bee.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.400
Bye, bee.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.840
Yeah, I got your message.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.420
What? Something about saving my ass?

28:17.450 --> 28:18.840
I can't talk long.

28:18.900 --> 28:21.380
Let's meet up tonight.
Take care of all this.

28:22.140 --> 28:23.280
All of what?

28:24.350 --> 28:25.800
Tell you when I see you.

28:32.390 --> 28:33.920
So...

28:34.200 --> 28:36.200
now, that kid didn't
give me what I wanted,

28:36.230 --> 28:37.880
but I got enough.

28:38.370 --> 28:40.660
I got a guy who knows a guy,

28:40.720 --> 28:42.300
who might know your guy.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.960
The mystery dealer.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.860
But we gotta catch him tonight.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.720
You in?

28:52.560 --> 28:54.510
That phone call didn't
look like good news.

28:54.550 --> 28:56.480
Now, don't you worry about that.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.920
Got that on lock.

29:02.020 --> 29:03.840
This life ain't so bad, man.

29:03.940 --> 29:05.220
No matter what they tell you.

29:06.390 --> 29:07.490
So you like doing this?

29:07.530 --> 29:09.340
Now, what's "like" got
to do with anything?

29:10.230 --> 29:12.130
I do what I have to do
to survive out here.

29:12.170 --> 29:13.760
I-I just never imagined you...

29:13.840 --> 29:16.140
We all couldn't end up
in English Turn, boy.

29:17.510 --> 29:19.110
Some of us have to work.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.480
Look out there.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.840
This city?

29:23.280 --> 29:24.540
It's a city of survivors.

29:25.450 --> 29:26.510
Survivors of what?

29:26.550 --> 29:28.150
Whatever the world throws at you.

29:30.250 --> 29:32.290
The world keeps trying to bring us down.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.960
But we rise up.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.580
Always.

29:36.190 --> 29:38.200
This guy at my school
always tells me that.

29:38.260 --> 29:40.520
We try to hold something
in, that energy builds up,

29:40.540 --> 29:42.130
and it comes out somehow.

29:44.330 --> 29:46.040
In ways you don't expect.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.700
It's like that out here.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.420
Whatever you put out, it comes back.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.520
It always comes back.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.510
It won't come back fair.

29:55.540 --> 29:57.140
It won't come back right.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.880
But it comes back.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.180
Like justice.

30:03.220 --> 30:05.250
Justice is for white people
in some other place.

30:06.350 --> 30:07.640
Not us here.

30:17.430 --> 30:19.320
I can't believe you live here.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.740
Bet your dad loves it.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.380
Does he live nearby?

30:24.900 --> 30:26.520
Why do you keep asking me about my dad?

30:27.380 --> 30:28.840
Oh, I...

30:28.920 --> 30:31.240
I don't know. I was...
I was just wondering.

30:31.280 --> 30:32.450
He seems awesome.

30:32.480 --> 30:33.900
He is awesome.

30:34.220 --> 30:36.760
But is there anything you wanna tell me?

30:37.260 --> 30:38.260
Like what?

30:38.320 --> 30:41.220
You know way too much about
rig schematics for one.

30:41.260 --> 30:43.320
You're blonde, the right age.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.720
Smart.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.819
And the dad who went school to school

30:46.820 --> 30:48.820
teaching science for fun?

30:49.060 --> 30:50.640
That was Nathan Bowen.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.760
You're not Liz. You're Tandy.

30:57.610 --> 30:59.440
And you're kind of a shitty liar.

31:04.180 --> 31:06.200
I've been turnin' these cards over

31:06.260 --> 31:09.170
ever since my Nana taught
me all those times ago.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.200
And these two positions,

31:11.240 --> 31:13.000
they always scared me the most.

31:13.410 --> 31:15.270
And this time is no different.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.280
I was hoping this cycle
would break pattern.

31:19.310 --> 31:20.600
For your boy.

31:22.250 --> 31:23.800
But...

31:23.900 --> 31:26.500
it's the same as it was
for all the others.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.780
What is it, Tante?

31:34.020 --> 31:35.340
One will live.

31:37.530 --> 31:39.160
And one will die.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.159
What?

31:51.160 --> 31:52.750
When you rolled in here the other day,

31:52.760 --> 31:54.360
I didn't think you had
any iron in there.

31:54.410 --> 31:55.680
Shoulda known.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.780
- Known what?
- That you got balls, man.

31:58.580 --> 32:00.760
I mean, you always did
punch above your weight.

32:01.550 --> 32:02.920
Ballin'.

32:03.420 --> 32:05.280
Stealin' that radio.

32:05.860 --> 32:08.420
I mean, you jumped in the
lake to save Billy. Hell...

32:14.570 --> 32:16.200
Wait, you were there?

32:18.400 --> 32:20.480
You were there when Billy got shot.

32:20.860 --> 32:23.370
- That's why Connors...
- What do you know about him?

32:23.410 --> 32:26.160
You're working with the
cop who killed Billy.

32:26.510 --> 32:27.940
He... he was your friend.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.380
And he's dead.

32:29.410 --> 32:32.000
I'm not. What was I supposed to do?

32:32.040 --> 32:33.560
You knew.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.160
All these years.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.620
You know my parents think I'm a liar?

32:39.260 --> 32:40.780
Think I'm crazy.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.490
I-I thought I was crazy.

32:42.530 --> 32:45.130
You are if you playin' me
just to bust some cop.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.140
Use what you got, right?

32:50.700 --> 32:52.040
Well, I see what you used.

32:52.060 --> 32:53.340
Yeah, to build a business.

32:53.370 --> 32:55.720
My dead brother built this business.

32:58.060 --> 33:00.760
His blood's in your mill and you
could've changed everything.

33:00.800 --> 33:01.960
What would've changed?

33:02.040 --> 33:04.060
Billy would still be dead!

33:04.080 --> 33:05.280
Maybe you too.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.680
I mean, you could come forward now.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.039
You could tell everyone what you saw.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.040
Then I'd definitely be dead.

33:10.590 --> 33:12.260
What good would that do?

33:12.290 --> 33:13.490
Huh?

33:14.880 --> 33:16.320
I told you.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.240
I survive.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.680
Survive?

33:21.960 --> 33:23.780
That cop's got you in his pocket.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.570
You deal drugs.

33:27.610 --> 33:30.170
You talk a good game,
you talk about heart.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.480
What kinda heart are you showing?

33:33.510 --> 33:35.420
- Say that again.
- I will.

33:36.450 --> 33:38.500
I'll say it and I'll keep saying it.

33:39.580 --> 33:43.120
Every day, you kill my
brother all over again.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.390
Come on, man, you... you
can do better than this.

33:49.430 --> 33:50.619
For what?

33:50.620 --> 33:52.040
Justice?

33:52.860 --> 33:54.160
For Billy.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.860
So he didn't just die for nothing.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.080
This is my guy, so give me
five minutes, then come in.

34:17.190 --> 34:18.679
Don't look so nervous.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.159
We're not done, okay?

34:23.260 --> 34:24.290
We can talk more.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.376
Later.

34:25.400 --> 34:26.500
But you gotta go.

34:26.530 --> 34:28.159
Now! Out the back.

34:33.469 --> 34:35.370
Hey, Angie.

34:35.409 --> 34:36.820
Hey!

34:37.610 --> 34:39.600
Reinforcements, I see?

34:39.659 --> 34:40.819
Baked fresh this morning.

34:42.350 --> 34:44.280
I think he's looking
forward to seeing you.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.580
Cool.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.220
Hey, Dad.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.070
Dad, I saw Bee Arthur today.

35:13.510 --> 35:15.140
Hey.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.380
How'd you find me?

35:20.420 --> 35:22.680
Oh, right, you're a stalker liar.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.090
I'm sorry.

35:27.190 --> 35:28.700
I'm sorry I lied to you.

35:30.290 --> 35:32.180
Why couldn't you just tell me the truth?

35:32.530 --> 35:34.330
I would've taken you to him.

35:37.370 --> 35:40.340
I guess the truth never occurred to me.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.960
The truth?

35:42.610 --> 35:44.420
The truth never occurred to you?

35:46.380 --> 35:48.520
All I do is lie.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.600
What did you want anyway?

35:55.190 --> 35:56.520
Answers...

35:58.490 --> 36:00.190
about my dad.

36:01.390 --> 36:03.540
About what happened.

36:06.330 --> 36:07.980
I thought Ivan may know.

36:09.220 --> 36:10.880
I'm sorry, Tandy.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.880
My dad can't come to
the phone right now.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.800
Can I try and talk to him?

36:24.480 --> 36:25.860
Yeah, go for it.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.880
Hi, Mr. Hess.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.530
My name's Tandy Bowen.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.100
You knew my dad.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.500
I just wanted to say hi.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.120
I'm so sorry that he can't help you.

38:11.220 --> 38:12.500
It's okay.

38:18.560 --> 38:21.000
I think I know someone who can.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.120
Let's just get this all settled.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.640
Yeah, let's.

38:28.570 --> 38:30.410
You're gonna help me with a problem.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.240
Whoa, wait! What... what?

38:32.280 --> 38:33.299
In about a minute,

38:33.300 --> 38:35.500
a cop's gonna come through that door.

38:35.540 --> 38:37.250
She's our problem.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.180
You're gonna take her out.

38:39.220 --> 38:40.520
Hold up! I ain't shooting nobody!

38:40.540 --> 38:42.040
Look, you need to clean up your mess!

38:42.590 --> 38:44.540
Your little errand boys got all sloppy!

38:47.460 --> 38:48.780
This cop's only on to you

38:48.800 --> 38:50.019
because you can't run a tight ship!

38:50.020 --> 38:51.040
Why don't you do it?!

38:51.060 --> 38:52.560
My hands are dirty enough.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.370
You take care of this,

39:02.410 --> 39:04.340
I'll keep all NOPD off your back.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.480
Okay?

39:08.210 --> 39:10.480
What? You never shoot anyone before?

39:11.040 --> 39:12.240
Not to death.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.020
Be better for business when it's done.

39:16.390 --> 39:17.860
Trust me.

39:22.980 --> 39:25.240
Use what you got, right?

39:25.460 --> 39:27.060
Get ready.

39:36.470 --> 39:37.860
O'Reilly!

39:38.510 --> 39:40.800
No!

39:40.920 --> 39:42.020
Shit!

39:42.060 --> 39:43.170
Runner!

40:17.820 --> 40:19.320
Ty?

40:35.500 --> 40:36.570
Ty, what's wrong?
