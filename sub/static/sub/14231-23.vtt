How could the poor guy let it get so bad?

[man 2] I don't even think rippin' it out

08:55.994 --> 08:57.495

08:57.787 --> 08:59.289
Oh, my gawrsh.

[man 1] Uh-uh. Nope. Over now. Forget it.

Nah, it's impossible.
I ain't listenin' to this. [mumbling]

09:19.517 --> 09:22.812
Maybe we could fix the problem
if we ripped out a few more sinks.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.065
Hey, hey, Toby,
now you're cookin' with gas.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.067
[stammers] What is this messy mess
you're making? What?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.944
We're repairing a leaky faucet.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.946
But we didn't have the right washer,

09:32.030 --> 09:35.033
so we had to improv-- uh...
make it up as we go along.

09:35.116 --> 09:39.412
Out, out, before I improv--
make up you! Get out!

09:39.496 --> 09:41.664
Doc, I was wonderin'--

09:41.748 --> 09:43.667
Whoa! Ow! Uh-oh!

09:43.750 --> 09:44.959
And what do you want?

09:45.043 --> 09:47.379
I suppose you want to ruin
my faucets, too, huh?

09:48.046 --> 09:49.422
I wouldn't think of it, Doc.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.716
I just want to see
how my pal Pete's doin'.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.219
Oh, well, that's all right, then.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.554
We'll-We'll look at his X-rays.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.309
I can't stand it!
I have to know the truth!

10:01.393 --> 10:03.728
So how is old Petey boy, Doc?

10:03.978 --> 10:07.107
Well, I... I don't believe this.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.650
Is it bad?

10:08.733 --> 10:09.651
Bad?

10:10.151 --> 10:11.152
Bad?

10:11.319 --> 10:12.654
[laughing]

10:12.737 --> 10:14.823
I'm a medical joke,

10:14.906 --> 10:16.950
a riddle of mother nature.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.452
[laughing]

10:21.454 --> 10:22.288
Serious, huh?

10:22.372 --> 10:24.916
Are you kidding? Ha ha ha!

10:25.000 --> 10:27.252
According to this silly X-ray,

10:27.335 --> 10:30.088
your buddy's either--
ha ha ha-- terminal

10:30.213 --> 10:31.673
or he's a gopher.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.509
Gopher? Don't you mean goner, Doc?

10:34.592 --> 10:36.177
Goner? Gopher?

10:36.261 --> 10:39.139
Don't interrupt. I'm on a roll here.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.765
Now... how often do you think

10:40.849 --> 10:43.059
we find something
to laugh at around here?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.311
Now where was I?

10:45.395 --> 10:47.272
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Gopher.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.898
Listen to this one.

10:49.274 --> 10:54.237
I don't think your pal will
last past Groundhog Day!

10:54.320 --> 10:56.656
Ha ha ha ha! You get it?

10:57.115 --> 10:59.576
No. I think it's Pete that's got it.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.995
That's a good one!

11:02.078 --> 11:03.830
Ha ha ha ha!

11:03.913 --> 11:04.956
How about this one?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.584
[clears throat]
The old boy will probably croak

11:07.667 --> 11:11.087
if he sees his own shadow.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

11:11.546 --> 11:13.506
Gawrsh. Poor Petey.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.549
Yeah.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.426
Gawrsh. Poor Petey.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.637
Come on, let's go try
this out on Peter, huh?

11:19.679 --> 11:23.224
Never mind, Doc. I heard everything.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.394
Oh, fudge!
Then you might as well go home.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.147
There's nothing more
we can do for you here.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.901
Oh, listen, Doc,
don't tell all this stuff to my family.

11:32.984 --> 11:33.985
What's the use?

11:34.069 --> 11:37.072
They probably don't have
any sense of humor, either.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.367
Can't say much for his bedside manner.

11:40.450 --> 11:44.287
You know, Goof,
it's not that I'm afraid to die.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.956
I just don't want to be there
when it happens.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.124

12:01.096 --> 12:03.264
[Pete] Nipped in the bud.

That's where life's nipped me--

12:05.183 --> 12:06.309
right in my bud.

12:06.393 --> 12:10.980
What's the world gonna do
without sweet, amiable me?

12:13.024 --> 12:14.317

12:14.401 --> 12:16.277
Can't you see I'm being profound?

That dumb dog really
got my gopher beatin' that time.

12:21.282 --> 12:25.537
Where was I? Oh, yeah.
Sweet and amiable...

12:27.580 --> 12:31.251
Loved by all for my sunny disposition.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.669
Lift your feet!

12:32.752 --> 12:33.670
Yes, ma'am.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.464
What'll she do without me?

12:36.548 --> 12:40.301
And P.J. and Pistolkins?

12:40.802 --> 12:42.887
And that stupid chain saw?

12:43.346 --> 12:46.266
But I can make a difference
while I'm still here.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.976
And I will!

12:48.476 --> 12:51.271

what's good for ya!

12:51.354 --> 12:52.939
Huh?

12:53.773 --> 12:56.317
What are we up to now, Peter?

12:56.401 --> 12:58.778
Aw, let me do this for you, corn nut.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.031
Are you all right, Pete?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.033
Well, of course I'm all right.

13:03.783 --> 13:08.038
Can't a hubby do his lambykins
a favor once in a while? Hmm?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.123
I think he got bumped harder
than I thought.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.125
Let me see now. Ahh!

13:12.500 --> 13:14.878
No wonder women think this is hard work.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.130
They don't have it turned up enough.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.090
Whoa-ohh!

13:20.550 --> 13:23.553
Aah! Help! Stop!

14:44.509 --> 14:46.594
With this one, you can sell anything.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.930

Uh, gosh, sir, why don't you keep 'em
and maybe I'll borrow 'em later?

15:01.317 --> 15:03.069
Later.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.571
Oh. No, no, son.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.197
It's better you should have them now,

15:06.281 --> 15:07.240

15:39.814 --> 15:41.441
Because he's my friend.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.527
He plays with me when you're not around.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.238
When I'm not... Around?

15:47.364 --> 15:49.074
You know, when you're too busy.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.743
Oh! Oh, well, sure.

Good idea, pumpkin.

Nah. Just a lot of sloppy
goodbyes that way. [sighs]

16:28.988 --> 16:31.950

while I'm still kickin'.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.578

16:35.662 --> 16:37.539
Ever since I was a little spud,

16:38.248 --> 16:41.126
I wanted to be a Hollywood stuntman,

16:41.209 --> 16:42.877
but I was too scared--

16:42.961 --> 16:45.672
I mean smart to try it.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.174
But now's my chance
to do somethin' spiffy

16:48.258 --> 16:49.592

16:49.718 --> 16:53.013
Yeah, you ran outta good smarts
a long time ago.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.222
Thanks, Goof.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.725
Take care of things for me, pal.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.102
You can count on me, Pete.

things can only get better.

Oh, hiya, Peg.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.083
Don't you "Hiya, Peg" me!

17:22.208 --> 17:24.711
What's my big pinhead
of a husband up to now?

17:24.794 --> 17:26.629
"I have gone to seek my density".

17:26.755 --> 17:29.132
Honestly! His density is right here,

17:29.257 --> 17:31.009
and she wants to now what's going on!

17:31.092 --> 17:34.846
And I want to know
why he's decided not to pay my bill!

17:34.971 --> 17:37.307
Well, Doc, Pete was a little disappointed

17:37.390 --> 17:38.683
that you couldn't save him

17:38.808 --> 17:41.603
from that terminal chest gopher stuff.

17:41.686 --> 17:44.105
Terminal chest gopher stuff?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.566
What terminal chest gopher stuff?

17:46.649 --> 17:48.568
[nervous chuckle]
I was making a little joke,

17:48.651 --> 17:50.779
and your husband didn't think
it was funny.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.947
You were only jokin'?

17:53.073 --> 17:55.075
Of course I was only joking.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.243
Who's dumb enough to believe in something

17:57.369 --> 17:59.829
as silly as terminal chest gopher,

17:59.913 --> 18:02.665
for goodness' sake? Yuck!

18:02.791 --> 18:05.251

18:05.377 --> 18:07.921
I can't wait to hear this one.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.422
I'll tell ya on the way.

I still don't get paid?

18:19.015 --> 18:23.311

18:24.145 --> 18:26.314
[Peg] But, Goofy, where are we going?

18:26.398 --> 18:29.776
[Goofy] To save Pete from his density...
I hope.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.073

18:41.913 --> 18:43.790
you're a stuntman now.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.500
Leave the thinking to someone else.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.002
Just trust me.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.713
Yeah, I guess that's right.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.257
All that should be in that
itsy-bitsy mind of yours

18:52.340 --> 18:54.342
is how famous you're gonna be

18:54.467 --> 18:56.219
when this commercial hits the big time.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.054
Yeah. Famous.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.431
If you pull this off,

18:59.514 --> 19:02.892
you'll be a national treasure

19:03.018 --> 19:04.894

19:04.978 --> 19:07.105

to do this.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.798
