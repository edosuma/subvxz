Hello, the people,

01:21.215 --> 01:22.783
and welcome back to the show.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.453
So, let me get this straight,
you're telling me

01:25.486 --> 01:27.455
if I eat one of these
emotion cookies

01:27.488 --> 01:30.124
I'll feel the same emotion
that's on the cookie?

01:30.158 --> 01:32.326
That is absolutely the correct!

01:32.360 --> 01:34.328
Allow me to demonstrate.

01:34.362 --> 01:37.331
I will take this tears of joy emotion cookie,

01:37.365 --> 01:41.369
eat it, and experience
the tears of joy.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.571
The delicious!

01:43.604 --> 01:46.240
What? That was insane!

01:46.274 --> 01:48.809
- Mind if I try one?
- Be the guest.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.611
Oh, boy, let me see.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.281
- Well, this one looks good.
- Ooh, the super happy!

01:53.314 --> 01:55.916
The good choice.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.451
Mmm, ooh!

01:57.485 --> 01:59.320
How do you feel?

01:59.353 --> 02:01.189
I feel really, really happy!

02:01.222 --> 02:02.790
This is amazing!

02:02.823 --> 02:04.825
Oh, man,
I've got to try another one!

02:04.858 --> 02:07.395
Let's get a good one.
Oh, man.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.730
I can't decide, I'm just
going to eat them all!

02:09.763 --> 02:13.167
- Wait, you are not supposed to mix the cookies...
- Too late!

02:13.201 --> 02:15.736
It's crunch time, baby!

02:17.238 --> 02:19.240
Oh, no.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.243
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.344
I hate you!

02:23.377 --> 02:24.412
I love you.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.381
I'm sorry!

02:35.889 --> 02:38.192
Nice baby music.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.430
Oh, snap,
these fools think we're soft.

Come on, handsome,
let's do this thing!

06:51.945 --> 06:54.114
Oh, I can't go out looking like this.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.516
I look like a buffoon!

06:55.549 --> 06:57.150
She's never going to
go out with me now!

06:57.184 --> 06:59.453
It's hopeless.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.489
Or maybe it isn't.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.857
You know I'll always have your back, buddy.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.859
And there's one thing
I can teach you.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.595
Oh, what's that?

07:07.628 --> 07:08.729
Confidence, bro.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.230
"Confidence, bro?"

07:10.263 --> 07:11.632
Confidence, bro!

07:11.665 --> 07:13.601
Look at this suit.
This isn't you.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.604
You want to get to this girl's
heart, you got to be you!

07:16.637 --> 07:18.706
Even with my tuna fish breath?

07:18.739 --> 07:20.641
That's why we're
taking her for sushi!

07:20.674 --> 07:22.910
And even with my
freakish baby hands?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.645
Those hands are non-threatening.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.580
Plus, they're adorable!

07:26.614 --> 07:27.481
Oh, what about the fact

07:27.515 --> 07:28.816
that I have a miniature
version of myself

07:28.849 --> 07:30.651
growing out of my eye socket?

07:30.684 --> 07:32.720
Look, Big R, being true to yourself

07:32.753 --> 07:34.588
is the only way
to live your life.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.490
People call them imperfections,

07:36.524 --> 07:38.959
but the truth is they make us
who we are.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.561
Aw!

07:40.594 --> 07:42.663
I... I still don't know
if I'm ready.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.565
That's why I'm coming with you.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.634
Okay.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.935
Go get 'em, tiger!

07:52.740 --> 07:54.107
Hi!

07:57.845 --> 08:00.514
Okay, next time
go with the tuxedo.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.021
Shh!

08:55.603 --> 08:56.870
Ugh, the baby rain cloud

08:56.904 --> 08:59.707
is ruining our
cotton candy crops.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.674
If this rain keeps up,

09:00.708 --> 09:03.977
we're going to lose our
entire season's worth.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.814
If only there were somebody
here to help us.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.617
Yes!

09:09.650 --> 09:11.685
Raven, thank goodness
you're here.

09:11.719 --> 09:12.953
This baby rain cloud

09:12.986 --> 09:14.588
is flooding our
cotton candy field.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.790
Please, you've got to
help make him stop!

09:16.824 --> 09:18.325
I've got this.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.095
Um, excuse me.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.864
Excuse me. Hello?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.298
Hey, big guy, over here.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.736
Oh, pardon me,
I couldn't stop laughing.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.037
Yeah, I can see that.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.205
Well, it's kind of
raining a lot over here.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.676
- So if you could just...
- I'm just a happy little rain cloud.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.777
Yeah, great.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.046
You're making a mess. Stop!

09:39.079 --> 09:41.348
Well, that's not
a very nice thing to say.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.383
And you forgot to say "please".

09:43.416 --> 09:45.953
Look, I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.156
Hi, my name is Raven.
What's yours?

09:49.189 --> 09:52.626
Christopher.
Christopher the rain cloud.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.628
Cool. Now, could you please

09:54.662 --> 09:57.030
stop raining over
our cotton candy field?

09:57.064 --> 10:00.400
But I'm a rain cloud
and this is what I do.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.702
What's the matter?

10:01.735 --> 10:03.336
You don't like the rain?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.272
No, look!

10:05.305 --> 10:07.274
The rain is making
the crops soggy.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.310
Oh, jeepers, I can fix that.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.313
Let me just get some of this
out of my belly.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.415
Here, try it.

10:15.448 --> 10:19.219
Hmm. This is the best
cotton candy I've ever had!

10:21.822 --> 10:23.991
It's delicious!

10:24.024 --> 10:26.727
Oh, so glad!
Now let me go fix the rest.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.228
What!

10:30.698 --> 10:32.766
- Yay!
- Yes!

10:33.834 --> 10:36.269
Christopher!

10:36.303 --> 10:38.205
Sorry!
