01:03.454 --> 01:05.108
Shut up or I'll slit your throat.

01:06.979 --> 01:07.806
Stop!

01:08.633 --> 01:09.852
- Why don't you yell cut like

01:09.895 --> 01:11.941
every other director
in the world?

01:11.984 --> 01:12.898
Because it's digital

01:12.942 --> 01:14.683
and there's no film to cut.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.250
Get that
light outta my eyes.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.818
And why aren't you
wearing the blue sweatshirt

01:19.862 --> 01:21.124
like you're supposed to?

01:21.168 --> 01:23.083
- Why didn't you
tell me that earlier?

01:23.126 --> 01:23.996
Because
we don't have

01:24.040 --> 01:25.259
a wardrobe girl, that's why.

01:25.302 --> 01:29.480
- We don't have hair,
or makeup, or wardrobe.

01:31.091 --> 01:31.961
Hey,
you wanna grab this?

01:32.004 --> 01:33.267
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.399
- The whole Freudian
psychological thing,

01:35.443 --> 01:38.054
why the rapist is even
attracted to his prey

01:38.098 --> 01:42.014
wearing these blue
sweatshirts, is because of, uh.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.147
Shepard, explain
it to her, please.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.496
- Well, he's attracted
to blue because--

01:45.540 --> 01:47.281
- Because his father
wanted to punish him

01:47.324 --> 01:49.761
by drowning him in
the swimming pool?

01:49.805 --> 01:51.415
Very good Heather.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.069
If you knew that, why didn't
you wear the blue sweatshirt?

01:54.592 --> 01:56.116
That is
a good question.

01:56.159 --> 01:58.727
- Oh, are we still filming?

01:58.770 --> 02:00.163
- Yeah, well this is gonna
be good for the documentary

02:00.207 --> 02:03.123
behind the scenes,
making of, you know.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.341
Always film, always film.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.647
That was the last
shot of the evening

02:05.690 --> 02:07.170
and I think it was good enough.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.128
I just have to figure out
another psychological thing

02:09.172 --> 02:12.175
for the, another
viewpoint, another.

02:13.394 --> 02:14.177
Got it.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.702
I got it, red ticks him
off because it reminds him

02:17.746 --> 02:19.791
when he was just like a
little two-year-old kid

02:19.835 --> 02:22.229
and his insane parents
would abuse the heck out

02:22.272 --> 02:23.273
of him by force
feeding him bottles--

02:23.317 --> 02:25.406
- Bottles of ketchup, ketchup so

02:25.449 --> 02:26.755
he would vomit red everywhere!

02:26.798 --> 02:28.844
- I like that, that's it, good.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.106
Okay.
- Genius, Joey.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.020
- So, listen, I think
we did good work.

02:31.063 --> 02:32.239
Let's like call it a night.

02:32.282 --> 02:33.805
That's a wrap!

02:33.849 --> 02:35.851
Let's just get the lights
packed up, the bags.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.113
Come on, let's get outta here.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.855
- Why don't, why
don't you just turn

02:39.898 --> 02:42.379
this into a biography about me?

02:44.164 --> 02:47.036
Should we
ditch the other guys?

02:49.038 --> 02:50.170
- My shins hurt.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.173
My shoulder hurts.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.131
Did you have to bang me so hard?

02:56.915 --> 02:59.701
- I'm sorry, I just
wanted it to be realistic.

02:59.744 --> 03:00.963
- Yeah?

03:02.051 --> 03:04.575
Realistic enough for you now?

03:05.750 --> 03:06.882
All
right, come on down.

03:06.925 --> 03:09.232
Straight ahead, get a nice shot.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.843
Closer, walk to, a bit forward.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.237
Get the nice foreground
leaves here, that's good.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.934
Dutch it a little bit, Dutch it.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.284
Get it scary, Dutch it.
- Da-na.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.199
- More, more.
- Da-na.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.330
I thought
you wanted to stay away

03:20.374 --> 03:22.463
from the typical horror music?

03:22.506 --> 03:24.987
Besides, we can't afford
the rights to that anyway.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.118
Where's Joey?

03:27.903 --> 03:29.296
Come on, dude.
- Come on, sexy.

03:29.339 --> 03:30.210
- Hi, Joey!

03:37.129 --> 03:39.001
- How do you get it to do that?

03:39.044 --> 03:41.221
- It actually balances
on a few grains of salt.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.399
- Do you guys ever stop filming?

03:46.269 --> 03:47.052
Addicts!

03:48.576 --> 03:50.839
- Filmmaking is kind of
like an arranged marriage.

03:50.882 --> 03:53.058
You never really know
what you're gonna get.

03:53.102 --> 03:56.540
- Yeah, especially if
you were to marry you.

03:56.584 --> 03:57.889
- You wish.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.369
- Ooh, fighting words.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.023
- Am I being a bitch?

04:01.066 --> 04:02.242
- Yeah, but we're used to
it so we still love you.

04:02.285 --> 04:03.765
Yeah,
well, men are bastards.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.027
Not us.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.899
- Maybe it's just
that I'm on my moon.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.031
Tell us about it!

04:09.074 --> 04:10.119
- No!

04:13.340 --> 04:14.515
- Sexual tension.

04:14.558 --> 04:15.994
Yeah.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.177
Wow.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.267
1896, is that the
oldest one you have?

04:27.310 --> 04:29.138
- Uh, I think I
might have older.

04:30.661 --> 04:31.706
Heather.
- What?

04:31.749 --> 04:33.795
- Ever seen one of these babies?

04:33.838 --> 04:35.057
- No.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.319
- This is a Morgan
Silver Dollar.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.104
Now, George Morgan was
an assistant engraver

04:39.148 --> 04:41.281
in the Philadelphia
Mint and he wanted

04:41.324 --> 04:43.195
to represent the
Liberty differently,

04:43.239 --> 04:45.197
rather than the usual
Greek-style figures, right?

04:45.241 --> 04:47.722
So he decided to use
an American model.

04:47.765 --> 04:51.247
Enter Anna Willis Williams
from Philadelphia.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.119
Now, after five
sittings he decides

04:54.163 --> 04:56.252
that she had the most perfect.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.645
What the heck?

04:57.688 --> 05:00.038
Heather, let me see your
profile for a minute.

05:00.082 --> 05:01.257
Come on in here.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.564
Lean in, would you,
something curious.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.653
Wait a second, look at that.

05:05.696 --> 05:08.830
As I thought, it's a
perfect profile, Heather.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.658
Just like the silver dollar.

05:10.701 --> 05:14.009
I don't know, I
think it looks more like Joey.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.664
You guys are precious.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.493
Now,
Heather, I would like

05:19.536 --> 05:21.495
you to hold on to
this as symbol,

05:21.538 --> 05:25.194
as metaphor that
you're so perfect.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.413
Normally,
we'd use a treasure chest

05:26.456 --> 05:28.153
filled with those.
- A hundred years ago,

05:28.197 --> 05:29.981
I was the perfect woman.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.595
- Dude, Shep, you're dad is
a killer with the ladies.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.553
- If only the women knew that.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.250
- Is everyone eating
here paying today?

05:38.294 --> 05:39.034
Beautiful.

05:39.077 --> 05:39.948
- Alright.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.341
Okay, thank you for everything.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.865
Only thing, the
tip is on you guys.

05:43.908 --> 05:44.779
Thank you, guys.

05:44.822 --> 05:45.519
You have another nice day, okay?

05:45.562 --> 05:47.216
- How we doing this?

05:47.259 --> 05:48.130
The old
credit card routine.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.001
- But you're broke, Houston.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.264
- Yeah, but I got big visions.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.099
♪ From the dark
and magic spaces ♪

06:01.143 --> 06:04.146
♪ Drifting on and navigating
through the corridors ♪

06:04.189 --> 06:06.801
♪ Of sunlight in the
country of your own mind ♪

06:06.844 --> 06:09.107
♪ Won't you tell
me that you need ♪

06:09.151 --> 06:11.022
Look at this
sweet, panoramic shot.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.460
- What are you doing, dude?

06:13.503 --> 06:14.374
Dude,
get out of the way.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.375
- I don't wanna kiss you, dude.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.593
Dude, what are you?

06:16.637 --> 06:18.029
Let's go, boys.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.423
Crazy class starts
in five minutes.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.251
- Yeah, what are
you teaching today?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.865
- You see what I have to
put up with with these two?

06:28.692 --> 06:30.085
- Look out!

06:30.128 --> 06:32.653
- So, will this help
me find treasure?

06:34.219 --> 06:38.223
- Well, to be honest with you,
it depends on your ability.

06:38.267 --> 06:41.836
You might be able to,
perhaps, perhaps not.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.707
Dad, this things
wobbling like a drunken sailor.

06:43.751 --> 06:44.795
I'm gonna ditch it.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.144
- Well, try the counterbalance.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.276
- I did.

06:47.319 --> 06:48.408
- Alright, do you.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.760
The alleged psychic ability
to perceive an object

06:52.803 --> 06:56.459
beyond the realm of
ordinary senses or science.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.680
This is called remote viewing.

06:59.723 --> 07:02.857
Training to use our
minds like radios.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.338
Tuning into the unique
electromagnetic signals

07:06.382 --> 07:10.473
that emanate from every
object or individual.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.127
- As long as it helps
us find treasure, eh?

07:12.170 --> 07:13.998
- Down with that.
- Woo!

07:15.565 --> 07:17.959
- Out of curiosity, has
anyone found any treasure?

07:18.002 --> 07:19.308
Anybody
wanna answer that?

07:19.351 --> 07:20.570
Go ahead.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.267
Elizabeth, tell
'em all about it.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.052
- My diamond ring, I lost it,
I couldn't find it for weeks,

07:24.095 --> 07:26.097
so I did the remote
viewing and did a drawing

07:26.141 --> 07:28.317
of what I thought looked
like a vacuum cleaner,

07:28.360 --> 07:29.927
but I didn't think it'd
be in the vacuum cleaner

07:29.971 --> 07:32.930
since the housekeeper changes
the bag every week, right?

07:32.974 --> 07:35.498
But I kept on drawing
that same image.

07:35.542 --> 07:39.284
So, I know it was in vain,
but I had Seymour, my husband,

07:39.328 --> 07:42.200
take apart the vacuum cleaner
and, believe it or not,

07:42.244 --> 07:44.855
he found the ring stuck
in the inside mechanism

07:44.899 --> 07:46.466
before it even reached the bag.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.119
- Wow.
- Whoa.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.643
- That would explain why it
had such a whistling sound.

07:49.686 --> 07:50.600
Whoa, what do
you make of that, okay.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.472
- Brilliant.
- Cool, huh?

07:52.515 --> 07:53.734
- Anyone wanna do an experiment?

07:53.777 --> 07:55.213
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

07:55.257 --> 07:58.739
I want you all to
relax, close your eyes.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.134
Relax your mind, breathe.

08:05.310 --> 08:08.096
Let images come through
your consciousness.

08:08.139 --> 08:11.708
See what kind of textures
you see or colors.

08:11.752 --> 08:14.494
And when you're relaxed,
in a minute or two,

08:14.537 --> 08:16.539
you're gonna open up your
eyes, start drawing lines,

08:16.583 --> 08:20.674
arms, whatever seems to
illustrate your vision.

08:20.717 --> 08:23.328
It might be the object
in its totality.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.940
Find a space that
has no significance.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.029
Okay, so take a moment
and when you're ready,

08:28.072 --> 08:29.421
we're gonna do this.

08:29.465 --> 08:30.379
And when you come
outta your trance,

08:30.422 --> 08:31.641
I want you to start drawing.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.807
Okay, boys and girls,
unbeknownst to anyone,

09:06.850 --> 09:09.331
including myself,
except for Sang

09:09.374 --> 09:10.550
manning the projector
in the back.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.639
And say hello,
Sang, to the group.

09:12.682 --> 09:13.465
Say, hello.

09:13.509 --> 09:14.684
- Hello, everyone.

09:14.728 --> 09:15.598
- He's the only
one that knows what

09:15.642 --> 09:17.948
the projected image is gonna be.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.471
So I'd like to see what you guys

09:19.515 --> 09:21.996
have drawn from
your consciousness.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.475
Let's see what you got.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.303
Ah, funny face, hamburger.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.523
Is that communism there?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.700
Mm, she's gotten
something on her mind.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.310
Take a look at this, Shepard.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.274
Very nice.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.060
And, Sang, hit it!

09:43.104 --> 09:43.974
What do we got?

09:44.932 --> 09:46.716
Whoa, look at that, not quite.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.067
What, where you going?

09:52.983 --> 09:54.550
Where you going?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.420
Fucking bullshit.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.509
- You're a joke.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.425
What're
you girls saying?

10:00.469 --> 10:02.602
- She think you're a fake
and she want her money back.

10:02.645 --> 10:03.559
No, hey.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.821
- I want my money back!

10:04.865 --> 10:06.301
We're just
beginning, we have--

10:06.344 --> 10:07.215
- No!

10:07.258 --> 10:07.998
- But we are only beginning.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.478
- I want my money back!

10:09.521 --> 10:10.914
- But wait, we still
have to practice.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.220
No!

10:12.263 --> 10:13.134
- I would like to have
my money back, too.

10:13.177 --> 10:13.874
I'm gonna get my baby daddy.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.092
Gonna beat you down!

10:15.136 --> 10:16.398
- No, no, no, no, no.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.268
You don't wanna
get him over here.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.443
- Professor Houston?

10:18.487 --> 10:19.357
- Yes.

10:19.401 --> 10:20.620
- More like Professor Useless.

10:20.663 --> 10:21.403
I'm sorry.

10:21.446 --> 10:22.665
- I believed in you.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.406
- I did, too!

10:24.449 --> 10:25.450
You don't believe
in me any more?

10:25.494 --> 10:26.713
What's going on here?

10:26.756 --> 10:27.670
- Don't quit your
day job, Professor.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.280
- But this is my day job.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.499
What is he talking about?

10:30.542 --> 10:31.718
- You're one step away, buddy.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.371
I know people.

10:33.415 --> 10:36.070
- But I didn't finish the class.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.419
- Yes, yes!

10:37.462 --> 10:38.942
I have my proof, I'm
going to the news!

10:38.986 --> 10:40.335
You're so going out!

10:40.378 --> 10:41.641
I got my proof!

10:43.555 --> 10:44.556
- Oh, boy.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.649
No, not Elizabeth, not you.

10:49.692 --> 10:50.606
Elizabeth.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.999
- I'm sorry, it's not working.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.174
- What about the ring?

10:53.217 --> 10:55.045
What are you talking about?

10:55.089 --> 10:56.830
- I don't trust anymore.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.527
I think he's seeing
that Amazon bitch

10:58.570 --> 11:00.485
at work behind my back.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.487
I thought he took the
ring to give to her,

11:02.531 --> 11:05.447
so I gave him an ultimatum and
told him if he didn't give me

11:05.490 --> 11:07.623
back the ring, I was
gonna give him the worst

11:07.667 --> 11:09.581
divorce of his life
and sue his ass!

11:09.625 --> 11:11.235
- Well, how many
times was he divorced?

11:11.279 --> 11:12.019
- None.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.281
- Wow.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.717
- I bet you he made
believe he found

11:14.761 --> 11:16.501
the ring in the vacuum cleaner.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.068
Sorry, Houston.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.983
- Oh, I'm sorry myself.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.204
- There goes the redhead.

11:23.247 --> 11:27.643
- Liz, that the hell is this
legal mumbo jumbo crapola?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.514
What, you think you can
just walk out on me?

11:29.558 --> 11:30.515
Me, huh?

11:31.734 --> 11:33.693
What, you got some
big hotshot lawyer?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.695
You're gonna take
half of what is mine!

11:35.738 --> 11:37.566
My freaking money, mine!

11:37.609 --> 11:40.264
I slave my balls off
down on them docks!

11:40.308 --> 11:41.918
No fricking way.

11:41.962 --> 11:45.095
I'm not taking anymore of your
Liz, biz, bull crap anymore!

11:45.139 --> 11:46.706
Let's see this goddamn ring.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.316
This thing is mine, this ring.

11:48.359 --> 11:51.972
This is not gonna be paraded
around on your unready fingers.

11:52.015 --> 11:55.236
I got plenty of other
younger, prettier little

11:55.279 --> 11:57.368
fingers out there just waitin'!

11:57.412 --> 11:58.892
- You know what?

11:58.935 --> 12:00.284
You just take that ring and
wrap it around your dick!

12:00.328 --> 12:01.285
'Cause it would fit loosely!

12:01.329 --> 12:02.243
- Oh yeah?
- Oh yeah!

12:02.286 --> 12:03.679
- Yeah?
- Oh yeah.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.985
- You're pathetic!

12:05.028 --> 12:06.726
You freaking call off
your lawyers or I will

12:06.769 --> 12:08.466
burn down the house
with you in it!

12:10.555 --> 12:11.687
Oh, that's funny?

12:11.731 --> 12:12.949
You find that funny?

12:12.993 --> 12:15.647
Then, they're gonna
find your charcoal body

12:15.691 --> 12:17.649
somewhere down in
the goddamn ditch!

12:20.740 --> 12:22.742
What the hell, are
you filming this?

12:26.876 --> 12:27.964
- Alright, no problem.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.574
I'm all right.

12:29.618 --> 12:30.793
I just may be a little
puffy under the left eye.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.360
Or was it the right eye?

12:32.403 --> 12:33.622
I don't know but I'm a little
concerned about the lens.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.711
Make sure the camera's
okay, would you?

12:35.755 --> 12:37.104
- Yeah, the camera's okay.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.409
- I'm worried about Elizabeth.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.107
- Oh, don't worry
about Elizabeth.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.804
They have this
sick codependency.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.675
They fight like
this all the time.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.939
They go home and they
make crazy sex together.

12:45.982 --> 12:48.593
Hanging from the
chandelier, she told me so.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.160
- Ooh, that's kinda special.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.553
- No, but I'm really glad
that you guys were filming

12:51.596 --> 12:53.120
that even though
it was dangerous.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.991
- Remote viewing is bullshit.

12:55.035 --> 12:57.689
What are
you talking about?

12:57.733 --> 12:59.169
- A breast?

12:59.213 --> 13:01.389
A penis?

13:01.432 --> 13:03.260
Do yourself a
favor and everybody

13:03.304 --> 13:05.219
else here and just drop it!

13:09.179 --> 13:10.964
- I guess she's angry.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.623
- What did you draw anyway?

13:22.714 --> 13:23.846
Houston, what is this?

13:23.890 --> 13:26.022
- I just jotted down what I saw.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.767
- It's the same.

13:33.638 --> 13:34.944
- Dad, it's exactly the same.

13:36.293 --> 13:37.468
You didn't know the target.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.295
- No.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.301
Sang.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.172
You picked randomly, right?

13:45.215 --> 13:46.434
- Yes.

13:46.477 --> 13:49.132
Picked out the trace
from hundreds of slides.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.133
Here, check it out.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.666
It could
have been any of those.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.364
- Yeah, how could
you have known?

14:03.407 --> 14:05.366
- Well, you know,
that's the strange,

14:05.409 --> 14:07.324
weird thing about
remote viewing.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.197
- Why'd you crumple it?

14:10.240 --> 14:11.459
- Angry.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.853
Wondering why nobody
else ever gets it right.

14:17.073 --> 14:18.770
- You've done this before?

14:18.814 --> 14:20.250
- Yup.
- This accurate?

14:20.294 --> 14:22.209
- Yeah, that's why I figured
I'd give a class on it.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.733
- I thought you were
just making this up

14:24.776 --> 14:26.822
to rip people off and
make a living off of it.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.911
- Then I figured it was a
very interesting premise

14:28.955 --> 14:31.348
that we could do a good
docudrama on, as well.

14:32.784 --> 14:36.440
Hm.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.182
Supposedly, if you let
your conscious mind relax

14:39.226 --> 14:41.924
using systematic protocols, you
can see your target anywhere

14:41.968 --> 14:43.317
in the universe no matter where,

14:43.360 --> 14:46.059
no matter the distance,
no matter the time.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.625
- Can you see the future?

14:47.669 --> 14:49.540
There were a couple
times where I wasn't sure.

14:49.584 --> 14:50.977
- Look, there's all
sorts of stories here

14:51.020 --> 14:53.588
of people finding lost
items using remote viewing.

14:53.631 --> 14:57.026
During the Cold War, the
CIA associated with SRI

14:57.070 --> 14:58.941
they find a secret
remote viewing research

14:58.985 --> 15:02.031
called Stargate Project
where psychics were able

15:02.075 --> 15:05.556
to view and describe a new
class of Soviet submarine.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.514
- The Government did this?

15:06.557 --> 15:07.776
It must be real.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.865
- Unless it's
coincidence looking real.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.694
I never could tell if it's my
mind playing tricks or not.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.787
I used to be getting these
tantalizing images, too.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.226
What kind
of tantalizing images?

15:23.270 --> 15:24.184
- Treasure.

15:49.383 --> 15:50.688
Okay, so
you actually want the

15:50.732 --> 15:52.125
voice recorder in
a shot like this?

15:52.168 --> 15:54.170
- I think that we
need more incense.

15:54.214 --> 15:54.997
- No, that's okay, Joey.

15:55.041 --> 15:55.824
- No?

15:58.740 --> 16:00.089
What
do you got so far?

16:02.831 --> 16:03.832
- Nope.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.877
Still nothing.

16:05.921 --> 16:09.011
I gotta turn some lights
on so I can see better.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.926
- I just lit the candles.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.363
- I know, but you're not
actually lighting the room.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.800
- Helping with the mood.

16:15.844 --> 16:16.976
Yup.

16:17.019 --> 16:17.889
I need some quiet.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.021
- It's alright, Dad.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.631
Are you getting anything yet?

16:20.675 --> 16:21.502
- No.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.245
- This stuff smells terrible.

16:25.288 --> 16:28.378
- We have Japanese,
Native American,

16:28.422 --> 16:29.814
and we've got Tibetan.

16:30.815 --> 16:31.947
Do you like spicy?

16:33.122 --> 16:34.776
- No, I don't need
any of this stuff.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.908
I just need to quiet my mind.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.867
Do you
want us to leave then?

16:38.910 --> 16:40.129
- No, I want you to
film this as it happens.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.130
- If it happens.

16:43.567 --> 16:44.916
- Thanks.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.180
- Come on, Heather,
give my Dad a shot.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.182
Take a look at the
images here, I mean.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.835
Way too many reoccurring
themes of treasure

16:50.879 --> 16:53.577
and the same chest
up in the classroom.

16:53.621 --> 16:57.190
I mean, the jewels, this all
just, it can't be coincidence.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.931
And kinda creeps
me a little a bit.

16:59.975 --> 17:02.151
We just need the location
then we'll go find it.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.761
- Maybe it's in a museum.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.459
- Yeah, maybe it's in
Pirates of the Caribbean.

17:05.502 --> 17:06.763
- Maybe, come on, guys.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.679
Maybe it's actually
real and it's just

17:08.723 --> 17:09.984
out there waiting for
us to come and get it.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.031
It's like I can hear
Billy Crystal saying,

17:12.074 --> 17:13.989
"Come and get me, come and
get me, come and get me!"

17:15.208 --> 17:16.818
- Yeah, maybe we
should call it a night

17:16.861 --> 17:19.864
because, I'm sorry, I
just can't get anything.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.823
- Sorry kids.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.738
I think you were close.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.914
- I'm gonna go get 40 winks.

17:28.351 --> 17:31.224
- Well, you heard him, boys.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.051
Nighty night.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.867
- Hey, Shepard.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.391
Shepard?

18:51.434 --> 18:53.088
Hm?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.481
- I've got a blueprint
for the site.

18:54.524 --> 18:55.917
- What?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.006
- Take a look at
this, come here.

18:58.049 --> 19:01.183
I gotta take the 405 South.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.924
Whereto, I don't know?

19:02.967 --> 19:04.230
- It's this chart.

19:04.273 --> 19:07.146
- Yup, I also drew
this section of a map.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.799
Take a look at this.

19:08.843 --> 19:12.412
X marks the spot under
the haunted tree.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.022
What that exactly means,
I don't know, but.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.198
- Well, it can mean
anything, it can be anywhere.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.026
There's no street names.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.117
- There's something else,
take a look at this.

19:22.987 --> 19:23.945
- Are you kidding me?

19:23.988 --> 19:25.468
Is that a dead body?

19:25.512 --> 19:27.862
- Shh, you're gonna wake him up.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.907
- What dead body?
- What dead body?

19:29.951 --> 19:32.083
- You guys scared
the shit out of me.

19:39.047 --> 19:42.093
- If that is a dead body,
then the only question is

19:42.137 --> 19:43.704
did it die from natural causes?

19:43.747 --> 19:44.966
- Or was it murdered?

19:45.009 --> 19:47.925
- I don't wanna go with
you guys, that's it.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.232
- You're just gonna give
up on the $100 million?

19:50.276 --> 19:52.147
- How do you know
it's $100 million?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.322
- Well, I'm just figuring.

19:53.366 --> 19:54.976
One diamond the size
of a strawberry,

19:55.019 --> 19:56.238
that's an easy million.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.718
The chest is filled
with more of emeralds

19:57.761 --> 19:58.936
and rubies and
doubloons, easily.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.460
- Could be way more than that.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.462
- Could be costume jewelry.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.986
- Hey, believe whatever you
want, but you gotta see this.

20:05.029 --> 20:08.511
Real fortune, bonified,
blood red colored gemstone,

20:08.555 --> 20:11.601
diamond, gold
symbol Au number 79.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.124
I looked all this up.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.256
It's mineral composition's
and it's atomic numbers

20:14.300 --> 20:16.215
and it's all
completely accurate.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.477
- Really?

20:17.520 --> 20:18.869
- Dad, there's no way
you could've known that.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.005
- Okay, what are we waiting for?

20:24.048 --> 20:24.745
Let's go!

20:24.788 --> 20:25.528
- I don't wanna go!

20:25.572 --> 20:26.355
- Wha?

20:28.357 --> 20:29.663
Let's go.

20:29.706 --> 20:30.403
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.274
- Okay, fine, go.

20:32.318 --> 20:35.146
Just bring me back
a pearl necklace.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.757
- Alright, let's go.
- Let's go search.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.889
- You're gonna go on a witch
hunt at 12:30 at night?

20:38.933 --> 20:40.326
- We have to get out of here!

20:40.369 --> 20:42.937
We don't want anyone
else digging it up first.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.246
- A dead body?

20:47.289 --> 20:49.117
You're gonna dig up a
dead body right now?

20:51.206 --> 20:53.426
This is ridiculous.

20:55.341 --> 21:00.215
Okay, guys, this is me
recording all by myself.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.261
You wanted to record everything

21:03.262 --> 21:05.481
so I'm recording this evening.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.048
By myself.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.253
Dude, what's that?

21:38.297 --> 21:39.298
- It's a moose call.

21:41.517 --> 21:42.823
- What was that?

21:42.866 --> 21:44.564
- Yo ho, yo ho.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.130
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

21:46.174 --> 21:47.088
Trying to get us sued?

21:48.916 --> 21:50.352
- Watch the lyrics.

21:50.396 --> 21:51.745
- Come on, guys.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.922
We've got treasure to find.

21:56.227 --> 21:57.707
That's more like it.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.406
- Hey, look who we got here.

22:00.449 --> 22:01.407
Oh, I thought
you weren't coming?

22:01.450 --> 22:03.757
- $100 million,
you bet I'm coming!

22:05.236 --> 22:06.281
- Hey, hey, Heather.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.326
- Yes.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.109
- So, you're coming now?

22:08.152 --> 22:09.328
- Yes.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.633
- That's cool.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.156
We're still splitting
it three ways though.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.636
- Ah, it depends who finds it.

22:15.290 --> 22:16.378
- Get in there.

22:17.292 --> 22:18.424
Oh,
we're finding it.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.209
You.

22:21.252 --> 22:22.515
Dude, I
just sent a message.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.952
- Did you ever hear that
story about the woman

22:24.995 --> 22:26.823
who went insane
and beat the shit

22:26.867 --> 22:29.435
out of her man with a shovel?

22:30.784 --> 22:32.960
Yeah, who do
you think that was?

22:33.003 --> 22:36.703
- Just saying, a woman
with a shovel's dangerous.

22:36.746 --> 22:39.445
Shep, we're
gonna take a right.

22:45.276 --> 22:47.278
- Alright, we need
a shovel, guys.

22:47.322 --> 22:49.716
Do you know of any
hardware stores that are open?

22:49.759 --> 22:51.587
- Not this late at night.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.894
- Well, one of us must know
somebody who owns a shovel.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.286
Everybody owns a shovel.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.158
- Yeah, except for us.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.247
- Oh, Aunt Lulu.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.901
Is that your
sister that's a pirate?

23:00.944 --> 23:02.119
- That's her.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.383
I love pirates!

23:08.125 --> 23:09.649
- Who goes there?

23:09.692 --> 23:13.261
I will shot the pants off
your butt with my bunderbun!

23:13.304 --> 23:14.915
- Sis, it's your bro.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.177
- Who?

23:16.220 --> 23:17.221
- It's your brother,
I need a shovel.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.399
- Hey, she does
look like a pirate.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.052
- Shit, Aunt Lulu's
blind and deaf.

23:22.096 --> 23:24.446
- This mansion is awful private.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.187
Now why don't you come out here

23:26.230 --> 23:27.667
and I will shoot you straight.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.539
- Oh shit, he's
gonna get us killed!

23:30.583 --> 23:31.932
- Come into the light!

23:31.975 --> 23:32.846
- Lulu.

23:32.889 --> 23:35.065
- Dad, stay out of the light.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.241
- It's your brother, Houston.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.374
- What's that now?

23:39.418 --> 23:42.464
It's your
brother, Houston.

23:42.508 --> 23:45.946
- Oh, Houston, why
didn't you say so?

23:45.989 --> 23:47.251
Come on in.

23:47.295 --> 23:48.165
- So what did you
think you were gonna

23:48.209 --> 23:49.906
do with my old BB gun anyway?

23:49.950 --> 23:51.255
- Oh, I don't know.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.736
I thought BB King was
a very good performer.

24:05.966 --> 24:07.576
- Great start to my evening.

24:07.620 --> 24:08.882
We almost got shot by somebody's

24:08.925 --> 24:12.363
sister trying to find a shovel.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.017
- Her bark is much
worse than her bite.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.629
She's never killed anybody
in her entire life.

24:16.672 --> 24:17.847
I don't think.

24:19.414 --> 24:20.763
Shepard, direct me, which way?

24:22.548 --> 24:25.246
- Can't you stop those hiccups?

24:27.248 --> 24:28.554
- Boo!

24:28.597 --> 24:29.380
- That's really--

24:29.424 --> 24:32.296
Boo!

24:32.340 --> 24:33.907
Try it.

24:33.950 --> 24:36.431
Alright, 405 South.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.694
- Okay, good.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.435
What I wanna do is pull
over somewhere down up there

24:40.479 --> 24:43.220
and I want you to get out,
get like a nice establishing

24:43.264 --> 24:45.309
pull by, drive-by, and use like

24:45.353 --> 24:49.444
a low wide Dutch scary angle.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.838
How wide do you
wanna go, 16 or 18 millimeter?

24:51.881 --> 24:54.014
- 18 millimeter will
have less distortion.

24:54.057 --> 24:56.451
- Good idea, let's
go with the 18.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.321
Okay.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.412
- This looks weird, how's this?

25:01.456 --> 25:03.153
Watch
out for the bogeyman.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.075
He's
gonna like this shot.

25:18.038 --> 25:23.043
What's that?

25:28.091 --> 25:29.658
Something out there.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.449
Something definitely out there.

25:38.493 --> 25:39.538
Shit!

25:45.369 --> 25:46.501
- Oh my God, it's a wolf!

25:46.545 --> 25:47.546
Shep, get in!

25:49.373 --> 25:50.549
- Hurry!

26:00.036 --> 26:01.472
- I wanna go home.

26:01.516 --> 26:03.518
- She's right, we gotta abort.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.346
- It's okay, I'm okay,
everyone's alright.

26:05.389 --> 26:07.348
We're gonna go home now.

26:09.002 --> 26:09.785
Hey, dude?

26:12.179 --> 26:14.877
You wanna do
something about her?

26:18.489 --> 26:20.579
- Would you stop
making so much noise!

26:20.622 --> 26:23.494
Can't you see we've all had a
stressful day, just not you!

26:33.592 --> 26:35.332
- We're going home.

26:36.464 --> 26:39.772
- I think this is like
Dark Night of the Soul.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.338
- What is she talking about?

26:53.829 --> 26:55.657
- Look at this, look!

26:57.964 --> 27:00.009
Wait, Houston, turn around!

27:00.053 --> 27:00.706
- What?

27:00.749 --> 27:02.359
- Look at this!

27:02.403 --> 27:04.623
Look at this, the wolf was
part of the remote viewing.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.581
You saw it, you saw the future!

27:06.625 --> 27:07.756
- I don't know.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.410
- This is so weird.

27:09.453 --> 27:10.890
This is real!

27:10.933 --> 27:12.805
We have to go back, we have
to go after the treasure.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.415
This is real.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.025
This is real now.

27:16.069 --> 27:19.594
- So two close encounters with
death, you wanna keep going?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.117
- But technically
it was only one.

27:21.161 --> 27:24.904
And Aunty Lulu's bark is
much worse than her bite.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.603
If we follow the
papers in detail

27:28.647 --> 27:30.779
we can figure out what's
gonna happen next.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.086
- Coffee anyone?

27:47.535 --> 27:48.710
This place is weird.

27:48.754 --> 27:49.972
- What kind of
restaurant are we at

27:50.016 --> 27:52.018
if they don't even
turn up the lights?

27:52.932 --> 27:54.542
Where is our food?

27:56.544 --> 27:58.459
- You got the 405 South to what?

28:00.374 --> 28:02.419
- He's working on
it, be patient.

28:02.463 --> 28:03.507
- Well, it's a long freeway.

28:03.551 --> 28:04.770
Just imagine it's a treasure map

28:04.813 --> 28:06.685
that's leading us
to $100 million.

28:06.728 --> 28:07.686
- Shh, wait!

28:15.519 --> 28:17.086
Heck, what's he doing?

28:17.130 --> 28:19.306
I'm so hungry!

28:21.743 --> 28:23.876
- I'm gonna go look for him.

28:23.919 --> 28:24.703
I don't think
we're ever gonna eat.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.705
- It's freezing in here.

28:37.803 --> 28:38.673
Hello?

28:40.762 --> 28:42.808
Man, good for nothin' waiter.

28:44.331 --> 28:46.333
Dirty robes, supposed
to be on vacation.

28:46.376 --> 28:48.161
I'm up here looking
for this guy.

28:48.204 --> 28:51.294
Hey, I know you guys.

28:54.689 --> 28:57.431
I can see you, but
you can't see me.

29:03.437 --> 29:04.786
Dude, put me on speaker.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.135
I'm in his office right now.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.268
I can see you guys on camera.

29:08.311 --> 29:10.705
Hi, yeah, okay, I see you.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.098
Okay, you can stop waving now.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.275
Oh, man.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.799
Dude, he thinks he's on
Dancing With The Stars!

29:20.846 --> 29:24.501
Oh my god, I think this
guy's a serial killer!

29:24.545 --> 29:26.242
Tell my Mom I love her.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.272
- Sorry, folks, it took so long.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.579
I'm really shy on help tonight.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.148
- This is a steak, I ordered
a tuna fish sandwich.

30:05.673 --> 30:06.979
- I ordered pancakes.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.594
- I don't eat beef.

30:13.637 --> 30:14.769
- Sorry, folks, it took so long.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.597
We're really shy
on help tonight.

30:18.642 --> 30:19.687
What about you?

30:20.775 --> 30:22.255
- A root beer float?

30:23.517 --> 30:25.606
- You didn't order
burger and fries?

30:25.649 --> 30:26.912
- No.

30:26.955 --> 30:29.436
- I could take it all
back, it's no problem.

30:29.479 --> 30:30.872
- That's okay.

30:32.569 --> 30:33.832
- No, don't worry about it.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.703
I wanna get back on
the road, I'll eat it.

30:35.746 --> 30:39.968
- I'll just take my fries, but
can you turn up the lights?

30:40.012 --> 30:41.448
And the heat.

30:43.929 --> 30:44.843
- The lights.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.674
Yeah, the lights.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.522
He is so weird.

31:13.741 --> 31:15.874
Can we just get back
to the drawings?

31:16.875 --> 31:17.963
- Yeah, let's go over
what we got so far.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.529
Can I see those, Dad?

31:21.183 --> 31:23.316
Well, a tattooed cop.

31:23.359 --> 31:25.405
- I don't like cops!

31:25.448 --> 31:28.277
- Uh, a key, it's
like an unusual key,

31:28.321 --> 31:29.626
like a skeleton key
or something and it

31:29.670 --> 31:33.152
says lost key with
a question mark.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.676
A bus depot.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.069
Mexican stores?

31:37.112 --> 31:38.766
- Mexico?

31:38.809 --> 31:40.942
No, you guys, the cartel's
gonna chop our heads off.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.465
We can't go to Mexico.

31:42.509 --> 31:43.814
- Wait, there's a girl.

31:43.858 --> 31:46.165
She's running and
somebody's chasing her.

31:46.208 --> 31:49.777
- Wait, that was the
scene we just filmed.

31:52.562 --> 31:55.130
- Well, you see that's
the thing, guys.

31:56.305 --> 31:59.569
Sometimes it's
imagination, memory,

31:59.613 --> 32:02.877
subconscious, it's really
hard to tell the difference.

32:02.921 --> 32:06.620
Maybe it's even all
coincidence, I don't know.

32:06.663 --> 32:09.275
But there is a thing
called confirmation bias,

32:09.318 --> 32:10.537
selective thinking.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.147
What's that?

32:12.191 --> 32:16.151
- Where one tends to notice
and look for what one believes

32:16.195 --> 32:19.633
and totally ignore what
one does not believe.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.201
- Francis Bacon.

32:22.244 --> 32:23.593
Mm, bacon.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.813
- No, Francis Bacon,
he's a philosopher.

32:25.856 --> 32:28.816
He said that it's peculiar
and perpetual error.

32:28.859 --> 32:31.471
Human imagination will always
be more moved and excited

32:31.514 --> 32:35.257
by affirmations than by
negatives, it's true.

32:35.301 --> 32:36.737
Very good, Joey.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.520
Proud of you.

32:37.564 --> 32:38.739
- Thanks.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.001
- When did you
start reading, Joey?

32:40.045 --> 32:41.220
- It didn't happen until
like very recently.

32:41.263 --> 32:42.743
Somebody gave me a
children's book called--

32:42.786 --> 32:44.832
- Okay, you saw the treasure.

32:46.094 --> 32:49.315
You saw the wolf, you didn't
just imagine those things.

32:50.490 --> 32:51.230
Let's keep going.

32:54.885 --> 32:55.669
- The dead body.

32:55.712 --> 32:56.887
- Okay, yuck!

32:56.931 --> 33:00.021
Maybe you did just
imagine that part.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.806
- Guys, I think I
got the location.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.199
I got the location.

33:04.243 --> 33:05.026
- Let me see.

33:06.767 --> 33:09.074
It's a pyramid in Egypt?

33:09.117 --> 33:10.858
- I thought we were
going to Mexico.

33:10.901 --> 33:12.033
Is that why we're
taking the 405 South?

33:12.077 --> 33:15.297
To go the airport,
to go to Egypt?

33:15.341 --> 33:17.517
Are you out of your mind?

33:17.560 --> 33:18.344
Are you insane?

33:19.910 --> 33:21.782
- I have a hunch, I think
it might be something else.

33:21.825 --> 33:22.870
- What?

33:24.176 --> 33:26.874
- 42.3 billion candles?

33:28.136 --> 33:29.398
That's a lotta candles to be

33:29.442 --> 33:31.357
inside a pyramid,
don't you think?

33:31.400 --> 33:32.532
- What you thinkin'?

33:32.575 --> 33:33.794
- Yeah?

33:33.837 --> 33:37.928
- Guys, they're not
inside the pyramid.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.147
They're on top of it.

33:39.191 --> 33:40.801
- That makes
absolutely no sense.

33:40.844 --> 33:42.846
- The tip of this pyramid
has the brightest beam

33:42.890 --> 33:47.895
in the entire world at
42.3 billion candle power.

33:48.896 --> 33:49.984
Do you follow?

33:51.638 --> 33:52.639
Not at all.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.859
- The Luxor Hotel in Vegas!

33:55.903 --> 33:56.991
- Shit, you're right.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.253
Shep, you're a genius!

33:58.297 --> 34:00.951
We're going to Vegas baby, woo!

34:00.995 --> 34:01.996
Ya-hoo!

34:03.389 --> 34:04.564
Would be nice
to have enough money

34:04.607 --> 34:06.392
to do the right thing
once in a while.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.310
- So what's the
scariest thing you

34:11.353 --> 34:13.225
guys have ever encountered?

34:13.268 --> 34:14.878
- The movie Jaws.

34:14.922 --> 34:17.751
When the group had retired to
the boat's cabin, drinking,

34:17.793 --> 34:19.969
getting drunk and showing
each other's scars.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.581
Ehen he tells his
experiences as a survivor

34:22.625 --> 34:26.020
of the sinking of the
SS, the Annapolis.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.543
Witnessing the
entire crew murdered,

34:28.588 --> 34:31.678
being attacked by
1000 hungry sharks.

34:31.721 --> 34:34.420
100 screaming men
being eaten alive.

34:34.463 --> 34:36.509
Blood bubbling up.

34:36.552 --> 34:37.422
- Good movie.

34:37.466 --> 34:38.641
- I think it was the Betty and

34:38.685 --> 34:41.079
Barney Hill abduction of 1961.

34:41.121 --> 34:42.558
Aliens with the
big eyes took them

34:42.601 --> 34:46.301
into their UFO and did
sexual experiments on 'em.

34:46.344 --> 34:47.911
Also there was that
mother that cut

34:47.955 --> 34:50.523
off her son's head and sewed
it to her own shoulder.

34:50.565 --> 34:52.090
That was pretty intense.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.221
- Ghosts.

34:53.264 --> 34:54.527
When you're sleeping
and you wake

34:54.570 --> 34:56.790
'cause you feel a presence.

34:56.833 --> 34:59.749
And you are so scared
you just wanna jump

34:59.793 --> 35:03.623
outta bed and run out of the
room but you can't even move.

35:03.666 --> 35:06.147
It's like that presence
is paralyzing you,

35:06.191 --> 35:08.758
you're just stuck there.

35:08.802 --> 35:10.586
What are
you most scared of?

35:11.587 --> 35:13.720
- Complete darkness.

35:13.763 --> 35:14.721
- That's it?

35:14.764 --> 35:16.244
- Yeah.

35:16.288 --> 35:17.419
- So you couldn't be Helen
Keller, that's for sure.

35:17.463 --> 35:18.986
Whoa.

35:19.029 --> 35:20.118
- Jeez.

35:21.031 --> 35:24.122
- We got a flat,
I gotta pull over.

35:32.956 --> 35:34.132
Oh my God, look at this thing.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.438
Must weigh 500 pounds!

35:37.744 --> 35:38.962
Oh.

35:39.006 --> 35:40.529
- You guys even
know how to fix it?

35:40.573 --> 35:41.356
- We're men!

35:41.400 --> 35:42.183
Let's go, Joey.

35:43.837 --> 35:47.101
- Damn, we're losing power.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.016
What are
you guys waiting for?

35:51.236 --> 35:52.019
The jacks all set up?

35:57.720 --> 36:01.202
- Here we go again,
me and my only friend.

36:02.421 --> 36:05.424
Over in Killarney
many years ago.

36:08.253 --> 36:11.038
- Oh, Shep, you actually do
know how to fix this thing?

36:11.081 --> 36:12.779
- Yeah, don't you?

36:14.868 --> 36:15.956
Yeah.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.479
And I'd give the world

36:17.523 --> 36:22.005
to hear and then she left
outside the cabin door.

36:28.447 --> 36:33.103
Guys?

36:33.539 --> 36:34.322
Guys?

36:38.457 --> 36:39.240
Guys?

36:44.898 --> 36:49.903
Guys?

36:51.296 --> 36:52.122
Guys?

36:54.516 --> 36:55.300
Guys?

36:59.260 --> 37:01.306
Guys, where are you?

37:02.307 --> 37:03.090
Guys?

37:05.788 --> 37:06.615
Where are you?

37:07.573 --> 37:08.313
Guys?

37:12.404 --> 37:13.143
What's up?

37:13.187 --> 37:14.232
- Holy shit!

37:15.276 --> 37:16.930
Where have you been?

37:16.973 --> 37:18.148
- We had to pee.

37:18.192 --> 37:20.194
- All of you guys
at the same time?

37:20.238 --> 37:21.543
I guess it's
like an animal thing.

37:21.587 --> 37:22.979
- Yeah, animal thing my ass!

37:23.023 --> 37:25.155
I felt like I was going
to die inside the car!

37:25.199 --> 37:28.463
I was hearing noises and stuff.

37:28.507 --> 37:30.552
- Stop giving her a hard
time, she got spooked.

37:30.596 --> 37:31.901
Come on.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.251
Everything's fine,
come on, let's go.

37:33.294 --> 37:34.904
- Go back into the woods
by yourself, Joey, now!

37:34.948 --> 37:38.038
- Come on, guys, you
wanna go for the treasure?

37:38.081 --> 37:41.520
Big rubies, diamonds,
yachts, airplanes?

37:41.563 --> 37:42.347
Come on.

37:44.871 --> 37:48.048
- Hey, do you remember
earlier when you asked me

37:48.091 --> 37:50.877
like what the problem
with getting married was?

37:52.705 --> 37:53.749
Point taken.

37:56.056 --> 37:58.188
You think there really
is a treasure, Dad?

37:59.581 --> 38:00.452
Yeah.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.497
- And we're gonna find it?

38:04.412 --> 38:05.935
- Yeah.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.068
What are you
gonna do with all that money?

38:08.111 --> 38:11.289
- Buy things, give
gifts, make movies.

38:12.681 --> 38:13.813
What about you?

38:15.249 --> 38:17.120
All
those same things.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.256
- Reminds me of when you
were a little boy, your Mom

38:22.300 --> 38:25.694
would ask you what do you
wanna be when you get older,

38:25.738 --> 38:27.914
and you would say I just
wanna be just like Daddy.

38:27.957 --> 38:30.090
Yeah, except
now I know better.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.571
Yeah.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.486
Eh, well,
it's still true.

38:36.749 --> 38:37.967
- Do you miss your Mom?

38:42.537 --> 38:43.886
Put that over there.

38:45.497 --> 38:46.585
You miss her?

38:52.199 --> 38:54.332
- If we really do
get that money,

38:55.855 --> 38:58.161
I'm gonna buy her a place
to live right near us.

38:59.554 --> 39:01.208
I could see her whenever I want.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.341
That's just the way
things should be.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.343
- Yeah, that's my boy.

39:06.735 --> 39:07.649
I'll tell you what.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.350
Let's go find that treasure.

39:13.699 --> 39:14.830
It's a plan.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.973
You guys need toilet paper?

39:32.021 --> 39:37.026
♪ Everyone can join the fun
if you make it in time. ♪

39:38.288 --> 39:39.159
If we find
that treasure chest,

39:39.202 --> 39:41.379
I'm gonna live in that house.

39:42.249 --> 39:43.424
Not over there.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.646
Joey can live there.

39:47.689 --> 39:50.823
♪ I wanna move

39:50.866 --> 39:53.347
♪ I wanna move

39:57.656 --> 40:00.963
- There she is, that
magnificent beacon,

40:01.007 --> 40:02.225
beckoning us to the treasure.

40:02.269 --> 40:03.879
- How far is it?

40:03.923 --> 40:06.012
- Maybe 15 to 20.

40:07.535 --> 40:09.145
You
think it's in there?

40:09.189 --> 40:12.671
- Oh, there's treasure in
there alright, but not ours.

40:12.714 --> 40:16.022
No, that beam is just pointing
us in the right direction.

40:16.065 --> 40:16.979
While you guys were sleeping,

40:17.023 --> 40:18.633
I did some more remote viewing.

40:18.677 --> 40:21.070
- How did you do it at
the same time as driving?

40:21.114 --> 40:22.463
- I etched it in with my finger

40:22.507 --> 40:24.204
into the condensation
at my side window here.

40:24.247 --> 40:25.814
There's
nothing over there.

40:25.858 --> 40:27.599
It must
have evaporated.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.470
- Hey, Houston, pull over.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.297
I have an idea.

40:39.045 --> 40:40.438
- Do that again?

40:44.833 --> 40:45.704
Smart.

40:46.748 --> 40:47.488
That is smart.

40:48.402 --> 40:49.577
- It doesn't make any sense.

40:49.621 --> 40:50.926
- It looks like hieroglyphics.

40:50.970 --> 40:52.537
- It's not too far off
from hieroglyphics.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.930
I think it's called a rebus.

40:54.974 --> 40:56.366
- What the hell is a rebus?

40:56.410 --> 40:58.064
- Oh, rebus is like a
coded message that uses the

40:58.107 --> 41:00.893
images and letters and
numbers instead of words.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.285
- Rebus, I remember that!

41:03.199 --> 41:04.418
Wait, here, look!

41:07.465 --> 41:08.814
What is she up to?

41:11.556 --> 41:14.297
- I can see you
well, it's a rebus.

41:14.341 --> 41:16.430
I can see you well.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.040
You get it, Joey?

41:19.477 --> 41:20.608
- What?

41:20.652 --> 41:21.914
I don't get it.

41:21.957 --> 41:24.438
- I remember seeing this
rebus decoder online.

41:27.528 --> 41:29.225
Alright.

41:29.269 --> 41:32.402
So if this is right
it reads, garage sale,

41:32.446 --> 41:35.971
buy map at Stoll and Maple?

41:36.015 --> 41:37.538
Maybe street names, maybe?

41:38.539 --> 41:39.671
- You guys are

41:39.714 --> 41:40.976
the greatest team.
- That's pretty awesome.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.282
- I think you guys are geniuses.

41:42.325 --> 41:44.414
You're the best team
I've ever had, come on.

41:44.458 --> 41:45.459
Back in the car.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.943
- Dude, wherever your
dad is getting these.

41:50.986 --> 41:52.422
Or whoever he's getting these--

41:52.466 --> 41:53.728
His ideas from.

41:53.772 --> 41:54.642
- They really seem to
enjoy playing a puzzle.

41:56.383 --> 41:59.342
I don't know about
you guys, but I'm starving.

41:59.386 --> 42:00.648
Me, too.

42:00.692 --> 42:02.302
Don't even
say that, you guys.

42:02.345 --> 42:03.390
We have no money.

42:03.433 --> 42:04.783
- Nickel.

42:04.826 --> 42:07.133
Where
are we, Bratislava?

42:07.176 --> 42:08.569
- Heather, dear, can
you do me a favor?

42:08.613 --> 42:10.528
Check my remote viewing pages.

42:10.571 --> 42:14.444
See if there's one that has
a slot machine then nickel.

42:17.709 --> 42:21.539
- There's one that has
a slot machine, nickel,

42:23.062 --> 42:26.282
thermometer, diner,
and the name Jackson.

42:27.196 --> 42:28.502
- And there's a thermometer!

42:30.678 --> 42:33.507
- Wow, this is
getting really real.

42:35.465 --> 42:36.902
- The largest
thermometer in the world.

42:36.945 --> 42:38.164
And there's a diner under it.

42:38.207 --> 42:39.687
I'm sure it's got slot machines.

42:59.533 --> 43:01.274
- Look at that, guys.

43:01.317 --> 43:03.711
- Ah, is that just a 20?

43:03.755 --> 43:05.017
- Just a 20?

43:05.060 --> 43:06.801
That's it, that's
a 40,000 % return

43:06.845 --> 43:08.368
off the nickel he invested!

43:08.411 --> 43:11.197
I'd like to see Wall
Street compare to that.

43:11.240 --> 43:15.375
- Well, actually, that's
Jackson on the front of it.

43:15.418 --> 43:18.465
So that's where the
name Jackson comes in.

43:18.508 --> 43:20.510
- Hey, look guys, it's not
exactly the treasure chest,

43:20.554 --> 43:23.426
but remote viewing is
proving itself to be working.

43:23.470 --> 43:25.211
I mean, it led us
to the thermometer.

43:25.254 --> 43:26.778
It was right about the nickel.

43:26.821 --> 43:28.867
$20 is not a lot, but it's
enough to get us some food,

43:28.910 --> 43:32.218
a little energy in the stomachs,
and we follow the clues!

43:32.261 --> 43:33.480
Keep going, find the treasure.

43:33.523 --> 43:35.656
- That's true, I agree.

43:35.700 --> 43:36.439
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:36.483 --> 43:37.484
- You sure?

43:37.527 --> 43:38.267
Yeah.

43:38.311 --> 43:39.660
- You sure?

43:39.704 --> 43:41.923
- I am sure, Houston,
let me tell you why.

43:43.359 --> 43:45.666
If you indulge me for a second,
allow me to pontificate.

43:45.710 --> 43:46.928
- Yes, please.

43:48.538 --> 43:51.454
- In this life, when you
have a hunch about something,

43:51.498 --> 43:53.369
a feeling, if you will,

43:53.413 --> 43:56.155
what are you gonna
do but go for it?

43:57.591 --> 43:59.462
"Cause tomorrow may never come.

43:59.506 --> 44:02.378
You know, we're just
here for today, possibly,

44:04.467 --> 44:06.556
and you may never have
this chance again.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.602
So that's why, that's
why we're doing it.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.125
- I like it.

44:10.169 --> 44:11.649
- Also I have no ride, so.

44:12.911 --> 44:14.477
- Alright, let's go
eat something, come on.

44:16.566 --> 44:17.480
- Well put, Joey.

44:17.524 --> 44:18.568
Yup!

44:19.526 --> 44:20.658

44:30.580 --> 44:32.321

don't think I can pee!

44:32.365 --> 44:33.932
Oh, God, I made it.

44:49.164 --> 44:50.513
- We need to get
off the main drag.

44:50.557 --> 44:51.689
I want you to take
a right on Summit.

44:51.732 --> 44:53.560
It's about two blocks up.

44:53.603 --> 44:54.822
Roger, got that!

44:55.736 --> 44:57.346
- Who's Roger?

we could ask?

46:55.682 --> 46:59.251
Um, I
don't see anybody.

47:02.036 --> 47:04.909
Hey look, look, a
cop, Joey's favorite.

47:04.952 --> 47:06.171
Hey, Joey, you ask him.

47:07.041 --> 47:08.738
- I'll go ask him.

47:08.782 --> 47:09.565
- Officer?

47:11.350 --> 47:12.786
Officer?

47:12.830 --> 47:14.657
What is he doing?

47:14.701 --> 47:16.659
Hey, that's not a cop!

47:16.703 --> 47:17.530
- Why is his face--

47:17.573 --> 47:18.444
Shh!

47:18.487 --> 47:19.880
What about his face?

47:19.924 --> 47:21.664
His face is blue.

47:21.708 --> 47:23.710
Officer,
I'm kinda lost.

47:31.979 --> 47:32.806
- Kinda?

47:34.677 --> 47:36.375
- Well, we're looking
for Stoll and Maple

47:36.418 --> 47:40.509
and our GPS kinda is making us
go around the Mulberry bush.

47:50.563 --> 47:55.568
- Ring around the rosie,
pocket full of posie.

47:56.699 --> 48:00.529
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down.

48:02.314 --> 48:06.535

first rhyme invented

48:06.579 --> 48:11.584

ringel, ringel, reihen.

- No, well, yeah.

48:49.404 --> 48:50.710
Guys, don't you
know it's impolite

48:50.753 --> 48:52.538
to film without
asking permission?

48:52.581 --> 48:55.062
- Oh, no, no, no,
it's quite alright.

48:55.106 --> 48:56.759
It's quite alright.

48:56.803 --> 48:59.806

49:04.942 --> 49:07.161
Do you know I once won
a kindergarten contest

49:07.205 --> 49:09.468

49:19.086 --> 49:21.088

49:22.611 --> 49:24.918

Stoll and Maple.

- Bye bye.

50:51.004 --> 50:51.961
- Thank you.

50:54.964 --> 50:56.836
- Those signs say Mein Kampf.

50:56.879 --> 50:58.098
Do you not know what that means?

50:58.142 --> 50:59.752
- Hitler's manifesto
against the Jews.

50:59.795 --> 51:02.146
I thought that guy was
gonna freaking kill us!

51:02.189 --> 51:03.886

pounded so hard.

51:03.930 --> 51:05.105

the bright side though.

51:06.106 --> 51:07.890

51:07.934 --> 51:08.978

51:18.292 --> 51:19.554
- Listen, people are
starting to wake up.

51:19.598 --> 51:20.773
And I feel like we're
getting close again.

51:20.816 --> 51:21.556

51:26.996 --> 51:29.086

59:00.798 --> 59:02.103
Oh god.

59:10.895 --> 59:12.940
- Houston, oh my God!

59:12.984 --> 59:14.768
The Nazi cop!

59:14.812 --> 59:15.595
How?

59:17.510 --> 59:18.555
Look!

59:21.819 --> 59:22.602
- What is it?

59:22.646 --> 59:23.516
- A green wrapper.

59:27.041 --> 59:29.348
You, you did this!

59:31.480 --> 59:34.222
You killed him when
we were asleep!

59:34.266 --> 59:36.050
- It's folded the wrong way.

59:36.094 --> 59:38.575
- Shepard, take a look at this.

59:41.534 --> 59:42.448
- Guys, he's right.

59:42.491 --> 59:44.189
He always folds it lengthwise.

59:44.232 --> 59:45.843
This is along the width.

59:45.886 --> 59:46.626
It's not him.

59:46.670 --> 59:47.932
- What does that mean?

59:47.975 --> 59:49.586
- Well, if it wasn't
you, then who did it?

59:51.500 --> 59:52.545
- Somebody's watching us.

59:57.202 --> 59:58.377
Who, where?

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.686
- It's double remote viewing.

01:00:02.729 --> 01:00:04.252
Somebody's remote viewing us.

01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:05.558
- Who?

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.429
- You're not the only
kook who does this?

01:00:07.473 --> 01:00:10.694
Oh, well, you were right
about the dead body.

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:13.348
But there's no treasure.

01:00:13.392 --> 01:00:14.872
- Not here anyway.

01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:16.438
But I have a suspicion we
find that mysterious person

01:00:16.482 --> 01:00:17.831
that's been watching
us and that person's

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:20.007
gonna have some answers for us.

01:00:20.878 --> 01:00:22.009
- So now what?

01:00:22.053 --> 01:00:23.576
We have to call 911.

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:27.754
I got nothing,
what about you guys?

01:00:27.798 --> 01:00:29.408
My phone is dead.

01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:32.846
- Alright, guys, we're gonna
have to take the body with us.

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:33.934
Please.

01:00:33.978 --> 01:00:35.544
- No way.

01:00:35.588 --> 01:00:37.634
I'm not taking that dead
Nazi cop with us in the car.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.726
- Alright, is everyone ready?

01:00:42.769 --> 01:00:43.552
- Let's go.

01:00:50.037 --> 01:00:51.386
Give
me a hand, Shep?

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:52.953
I gotta go--
- Did you eve tie him down?

01:00:53.954 --> 01:00:54.694
- Yeah, I did.

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.174
With what?

01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:59.568
- That stupid duct
tape that doesn't work.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.573
Oh my God!

01:01:04.617 --> 01:01:06.445
- Tell her not to
worry, I'm just gonna--

01:01:06.488 --> 01:01:08.229
Oh God.

01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:14.366
- See, that's easy, no problem.

01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:15.367
Shepard.

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:16.281
Yeah?

01:01:16.324 --> 01:01:16.934
- You think he'll be all right?

01:01:16.977 --> 01:01:18.544
- No.
- Why?

01:01:18.587 --> 01:01:20.764
He fell off the
roof and we weren't even moving.

01:01:20.807 --> 01:01:21.939
- He'll be fine.

01:01:21.982 --> 01:01:23.636
He wasn't flat
before, now he's flat.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.464
Come on, let's go.

01:01:25.507 --> 01:01:27.335
It doesn't
look very flat.

01:01:34.603 --> 01:01:35.735
- She all right?

01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:44.483
We have a dead body

01:01:44.526 --> 01:01:46.528
and we don't have any treasure.

01:01:46.572 --> 01:01:48.139
We have nothing.

01:01:48.182 --> 01:01:49.706
Yeah, we have the exact

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:51.490
opposite of what we
went looking for.

01:01:51.533 --> 01:01:53.318
- Guys, guys, listen up!

01:01:53.361 --> 01:01:54.667
Ding, ding, ding, ding!

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.408
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:57.757
Our inked up Nazi
friend upstairs

01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:59.759
is alias Adolf Himmler.

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:01.413
Fuck me.

01:02:01.456 --> 01:02:03.676
FBI's most wanted for the
murder of Leonard Hunter,

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.505
a famous treasure hunter
who uncovered a bounty

01:02:06.548 --> 01:02:09.116
of half a billion dollars.
- You hear this?

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.378
- Shit!

01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:11.945
- Shitting dollar signs!
- That's ridiculous.

01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:13.555
Crazy.

01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:16.036
- The wealthiest part of
the ship, the stern castle,

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.431
was filled with a king's
ransom beyond compare

01:02:19.474 --> 01:02:21.825
consisting of gold
bar's two stories high

01:02:21.868 --> 01:02:23.827
and 24 tons of silver bullion.

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:26.394
- Holy Davy Jones locker.

01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:28.048
- From The Monkees?

01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:30.529
- Part of the bounty stolen was

01:02:30.572 --> 01:02:33.358
called The Esperanza
mother load,

01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:35.708
consisted of pieces
of eight gold coins,

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.057
Colombian emeralds,
and other jewels

01:02:37.101 --> 01:02:39.364
from the wreckage called
the Spanish galleon,

01:02:39.407 --> 01:02:41.758
Nuestra Esperanza.

01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:43.672
- Davy Jones locker!

01:02:45.283 --> 01:02:47.676
- So we're still on, right?

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.722
- Well, it's up to you guys.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:50.549
- Of course, I wanna go.

01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:51.768
Are you crazy?

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:53.682
Did you hear all that?

01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:56.163
I'm gonna be rich!

01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:00.777
This
is the shittiest

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.169
police station I've ever seen.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.607
I think they're closed.

01:03:05.651 --> 01:03:07.348
- What kinda police
station closes?

01:03:07.392 --> 01:03:10.177
- The kind you find in
these crazy, sicko towns.

01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:12.440
- Alright, I'll leave
the body with a note.

01:03:31.155 --> 01:03:32.025
That's it.

01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:34.158
I think that's the house.

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:42.340
That's
creepy alright.

01:03:42.383 --> 01:03:44.864
- Yeah, whoever's been
doing the remote viewing

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:47.693
on us I think is in that house.

01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:48.607
- So call the cops!

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:50.174
- That's a great idea, Joey.

01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:51.218
Why don't we just go the
police station we just left,

01:03:51.262 --> 01:03:52.916
the one that closes up at night.

01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:54.700
- You know what, dude, there's
already been one murder.

01:03:54.743 --> 01:03:55.483
Do you wanna be next?

01:03:55.527 --> 01:03:56.484
- You're such a pussy.

01:03:56.528 --> 01:03:57.790
- Can you guys shut up?

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.444
You're not really
helping anything.

01:03:59.487 --> 01:04:01.620
- I want you kiddies
to make nice.

01:04:01.663 --> 01:04:03.622
I'm gonna go check
it out, I'll be back.

01:04:03.665 --> 01:04:04.797
Are you sure
that's such a good idea, Dad?

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.625
I'm having second thoughts.

01:04:06.668 --> 01:04:07.582
- It'll be okay.

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:11.325
I don't
think it's a good idea!

01:04:19.246 --> 01:04:22.684
- If I'm not back, call the FBI.

01:04:28.734 --> 01:04:29.866
- What's going on?

01:04:32.607 --> 01:04:33.782
Alright, you guys.

01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:36.873
Stay here, I'm
gonna go follow him.

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.268
I'll be back.

01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:00.766
Dad?

01:05:03.377 --> 01:05:04.596
What the hell?

01:05:07.642 --> 01:05:09.775
How high does that go up?

01:05:11.777 --> 01:05:13.866
Jumbo rat shit hole
in the ceiling.

01:05:19.089 --> 01:05:21.439
Did you find anything?

01:05:21.482 --> 01:05:24.007
- Shit, dude, you scared
the shit outta me.

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.095
Have you seen my Dad?

01:05:25.138 --> 01:05:28.141
- No, I haven't seen anything.

01:05:28.185 --> 01:05:29.403
Stay close.

01:05:31.536 --> 01:05:32.319
Dad.

01:05:38.325 --> 01:05:40.806
Dad!

01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:42.068
- Dude, dude!

01:05:42.112 --> 01:05:43.678
Watch where you're
going, you scared me.

01:05:43.722 --> 01:05:44.984
- You scared me.

01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:46.290
- Did you find anything yet?

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:47.073
No.

01:05:47.117 --> 01:05:47.944
Go that way.

01:05:51.773 --> 01:05:52.992
Wait, wait out here.

01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:54.602
I'm gonna check this
room, don't go anywhere.

01:06:02.088 --> 01:06:03.002
Look, stairs.

01:06:05.004 --> 01:06:07.528
You go, I'll be
right behind you.

01:06:12.142 --> 01:06:13.621
There's
nothing up here, guys.

01:06:13.665 --> 01:06:15.275
- You again.

01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:16.885
- Yeah, me again.

01:06:18.148 --> 01:06:20.889
Damn, I just hit my head
on something really hard.

01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:21.673
You okay?

01:06:21.716 --> 01:06:22.804
- No.

01:06:22.848 --> 01:06:24.545
You hit the ceiling.

01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:25.372
- Witch.

01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:26.808
Ow!

01:06:26.852 --> 01:06:27.635
- Trippy.

01:06:28.593 --> 01:06:29.376
Let's go.

01:06:30.943 --> 01:06:32.771
Heather, Heather.

01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:33.859
Make a face.

01:06:34.903 --> 01:06:36.035
- Really, right now?

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:38.472
Are you serious?

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:44.957
- It's so weird.

01:06:47.307 --> 01:06:48.700
Oh shit.

01:06:48.743 --> 01:06:49.962
- Your Dad's in here.

01:06:54.706 --> 01:06:56.012
Should we follow her?

01:07:21.254 --> 01:07:22.821
Dad.

01:07:22.864 --> 01:07:24.823
Are you okay?

01:07:24.866 --> 01:07:25.737
- Sure, yeah.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:26.477
I was calling you.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.260
You didn't hear me?

01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:28.044
- No.
- I was yelling.

01:07:28.957 --> 01:07:30.481
- No, I didn't hear anything.

01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:32.178
- I'm sorry about that.

01:07:32.222 --> 01:07:34.050
The gentleman that
lived here before

01:07:34.093 --> 01:07:36.182
I moved in was a musician.

01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:38.054
He had all the
walls soundproofed

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:41.144
and your father couldn't
hear anything as a result.

01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:47.976
Can I offer any of
you anything to drink?

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.065
Some wine?

01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:50.544
- Oh, is that red?

01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:54.026
- It sure is.

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.422
Uh, I, nevermind.

01:08:04.602 --> 01:08:05.777
- So what are you all doing here

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.257
anyway in the
middle of the night?

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.302
Are you lost?

01:08:09.346 --> 01:08:10.912
- Well, you know, you can always

01:08:10.956 --> 01:08:14.960
find your way with
remote viewing.

01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:16.917
Can't you?

01:08:27.886 --> 01:08:29.844
- I guess I can't
keep this masquerade

01:08:29.888 --> 01:08:32.151
up any longer, can I?

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:35.241
Not with a master
sleuth such as yourself.

01:08:36.328 --> 01:08:39.115
And you fry me with those eyes.

01:08:41.073 --> 01:08:43.075
Those magnificent eyes.

01:08:47.993 --> 01:08:50.604
- I wanna know why have
you been watching us.

01:08:54.042 --> 01:08:57.002
- I have not, or at
least not intentionally.

01:08:57.045 --> 01:09:00.613
You happen to get in the
way of my own visions!

01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:06.054
- You murdered him, didn't you?

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.624
- Well, he's not
so much the type

01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:13.497
to commit suicide,
that's for sure.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.412
Which is too bad.

01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:18.197
But, no, I didn't murder him.

01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:19.894
- Well, let me say,
we dug up a body

01:09:19.938 --> 01:09:22.158
and he's dead as a doornail.

01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:25.203
- Well, yes, bravo.

01:09:25.247 --> 01:09:26.466
That I know.

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:28.033
I left him there
lying on the floor

01:09:28.076 --> 01:09:30.122
with a dagger sticking
out his chest!

01:09:30.948 --> 01:09:31.732
Now.

01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:38.304
Can I offer any of you anything?

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:46.312
Lolly pop?

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.532
Ah!

01:09:48.575 --> 01:09:50.055
- I love lolly pops.

01:09:50.098 --> 01:09:51.187
- Here you go, my dear.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:53.232
- Thank you.
- Those are delicious.

01:09:53.276 --> 01:09:58.063
And for you, dear, you'd
adore the green one.

01:09:58.106 --> 01:09:58.977
I know.

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.370
- Why are you playing with me?

01:10:01.893 --> 01:10:05.113
- Because you and
I are the same.

01:10:05.157 --> 01:10:07.464
We both share a
magnificent talent!

01:10:07.507 --> 01:10:09.074
Doesn't that make you happy?

01:10:09.117 --> 01:10:11.163
Don't you enjoy when
you meet someone

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:15.123
who shares a gift
so rare and special?

01:10:15.167 --> 01:10:16.037
It makes me giddy.

01:10:17.735 --> 01:10:19.519
Come, come on.

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:23.175
I have something
to show you all.

01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:36.884
It's impressive, right?

01:10:36.928 --> 01:10:38.190
My pride and joy.

01:10:40.453 --> 01:10:42.150
Well, look at that.

01:10:43.282 --> 01:10:47.068
- So that thoughtful, kind,

01:10:47.112 --> 01:10:51.159
sweet, SS officer

01:10:51.203 --> 01:10:56.121
provided us with a video
for your viewing pleasure.

01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:07.132
- Joey.

01:11:07.175 --> 01:11:08.742
What?

01:11:08.786 --> 01:11:10.004
What?

01:11:10.048 --> 01:11:12.268
- Take a look.
- Come over here.

01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:22.016
- I'll fucking kill you.

01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:29.415
Ah, my leg!

01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:32.200
My eye!

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:35.116
Holy fuck!

01:11:39.207 --> 01:11:40.296
What did I do?

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.304
- So.

01:11:50.218 --> 01:11:52.699
As you can see, I'm innocent.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.661
That was just
like the scene we filmed.

01:11:57.704 --> 01:11:58.618
- You're telling me.

01:11:58.662 --> 01:11:59.880
- I'm ready for that drink.

01:12:06.191 --> 01:12:08.149
Why didn't you
go to the police with this?

01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:12.893
- Well, the police
are hard to find here.

01:12:12.937 --> 01:12:14.982
Why have you come
all the way here

01:12:15.026 --> 01:12:18.856
from LA to visit
sweet, innocent me?

01:12:18.899 --> 01:12:20.901
Was it to watch home videos and

01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:24.252
clear me of murder
charges, was it?

01:12:25.515 --> 01:12:26.646
- I'm just gonna have a
word with my friends here

01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:27.778
for a second in
private if that's okay.

01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:30.389
- Of course, sweetie.

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:31.259
- Guys, come here.

01:12:37.265 --> 01:12:39.224
I'm thinking maybe we
should take her with us.

01:12:39.267 --> 01:12:40.747
Are you crazy?

01:12:40.791 --> 01:12:43.271
- You think we should share
the treasure with her?

01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:45.317
- Are you crazy, we
don't owe here anything.

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:47.275
- Yeah, that's only if
she helped us find it.

01:12:47.319 --> 01:12:48.712
- Besides, we don't even know
if she knows where it is.

01:12:48.755 --> 01:12:50.017
- Right.

01:12:50.061 --> 01:12:50.844
- Alright.

01:12:51.932 --> 01:12:53.107
Uh, Miss.

01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:55.675
- Please, call me Liliane.

01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:57.764
I believe that we've
known each other

01:12:57.808 --> 01:13:01.768
for long enough that you can
go on a first name basis.

01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:03.422
- Well yes, Liliane.

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:07.295
We're on a very special, but
very, very dangerous journey.

01:13:07.339 --> 01:13:09.559
We'd rather keep our
reasons to ourselves.

01:13:09.602 --> 01:13:11.169
- Of course.

01:13:11.212 --> 01:13:14.302
So I'm sorry about your trauma
that you've been through.

01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:17.262
- No.

01:13:17.305 --> 01:13:18.785
Please don't apologize.

01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:22.789
It has been a pleasure
getting to know all of you.

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:25.226
If you follow me,
I'll show you out.

01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:27.054
Sure.

01:13:27.098 --> 01:13:28.360
- Please, this way.

01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:33.670
Just follow me along this
way, it will be best.

01:13:33.713 --> 01:13:38.196
You know, it is I who should
really be apologizing to you.

01:13:38.239 --> 01:13:39.110
Oh?

01:13:39.153 --> 01:13:40.372
- Yes, an eye for an eye.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:43.201
Just as you got in
the way of my vision,

01:13:43.244 --> 01:13:47.379
unintentionally I'm sure,
I blocked your vision.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.555
Every key has a lock
and you know the

01:13:49.599 --> 01:13:52.428
location of the lock,
but have no key.

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:55.387
And I have a key, but don't
know the location of the lock.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.955
So, you see, Houston,
sweetie, I propose

01:13:57.998 --> 01:14:01.872
that we combine our images
to present the clear

01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:04.004
vision of what it
is that you seek!

01:14:04.048 --> 01:14:05.832
- Interesting, to say the least.

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:07.791
I told
you I was intrigued.

01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:09.619
- Now, what is it
you want in return?

01:14:10.707 --> 01:14:12.273
- Just your kindred company.

01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:14.450
- So you wanna come
with us for a joyride?

01:14:15.842 --> 01:14:18.410
- I guess you could
put it that way, yes.

01:14:22.196 --> 01:14:24.372
- I guess it's to
the land of Oz.

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:26.636
Shall we?

01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:27.463
- Let's.

01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:48.527
♪ If I don't I'll go insane

01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:53.532
- Hey, it's like a Mexican
version of Cinco de Mayo!

01:14:54.446 --> 01:14:56.535
♪ Like a madman in the rain

01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:58.363
Look, there's
the buses you drew.

01:15:00.408 --> 01:15:01.671
- Yeah, look at that.

01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:07.372
- There was a bus depot,
I couldn't see that?

01:15:07.415 --> 01:15:10.331
- Perhaps because
you're a jet-setter.

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:12.246
Oh, hardly.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:46.585
I guess this is what
you've been looking for.

01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:47.717
- Good Jesus!

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.544
- God.

01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:53.374
- Hey, Joey, man, you okay?

01:15:53.418 --> 01:15:54.158
You don't look to good.

01:15:54.201 --> 01:15:55.028
Joey, you all right?

01:15:56.334 --> 01:15:58.292
Check him out,
are you okay, pal?

01:15:58.336 --> 01:16:00.164
- What if it's just
filled with sand?

01:16:01.339 --> 01:16:02.209
If it's just sand,

01:16:02.253 --> 01:16:03.689
why would they put a lock on it?

01:16:03.733 --> 01:16:04.951
Think about it.

01:16:08.085 --> 01:16:09.477
- How are we gonna open it?

01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:10.217
I'll get a crowbar.

01:16:10.261 --> 01:16:11.175
We'll jimmy it open.

01:16:11.218 --> 01:16:12.089
All right.

01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:13.003
Hurry up, 'cause the girls are

01:16:13.046 --> 01:16:14.570
like really antsy for the money.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.099
- Okay, ready?

01:16:23.491 --> 01:16:24.971
Go for it.

01:16:49.517 --> 01:16:51.389
- Are you okay?

01:16:51.432 --> 01:16:53.260
- I can hear the angels singing.

01:16:54.784 --> 01:16:55.698
Do you hear them?

01:16:56.699 --> 01:16:59.353
- I can hear something singing.

01:16:59.397 --> 01:17:01.660
Cayman Islands, here I come!

01:17:01.704 --> 01:17:04.750
- Dad, you know you're the
best Dad I've ever had?

01:17:04.794 --> 01:17:07.623
- I'm the only Dad you ever had.

01:17:08.885 --> 01:17:11.670
- How we going to, uh,
divvy this up right here?

01:17:11.714 --> 01:17:14.455
- Well, you could
take the usual route.

01:17:14.499 --> 01:17:16.457
One for you, one for
you, one for you,

01:17:16.501 --> 01:17:18.459
one for you, and
so on and so forth.

01:17:18.503 --> 01:17:20.505
That would be the easiest way.

01:17:21.811 --> 01:17:23.900
Well, anyway, it's getting late

01:17:23.943 --> 01:17:27.555
and I wouldn't want to
turn into a pumpkin.

01:17:27.599 --> 01:17:30.646
So it has been an
absolute pleasure going

01:17:30.689 --> 01:17:32.604
on this adventure
with all of you

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:36.695
and I wish you all
the best, au revoir!

01:17:36.739 --> 01:17:38.436
- Is she kidding?

01:17:38.479 --> 01:17:39.263
- Liliane!

01:17:39.306 --> 01:17:40.525
- Yes, sweetie?

01:17:40.568 --> 01:17:41.569
- You're kidding, right?

01:17:41.613 --> 01:17:43.136
- About?

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:45.443
- Leaving without taking
your share of the treasure.

01:17:45.486 --> 01:17:48.533
- I told you before, it's
not the material that I seek.

01:17:48.576 --> 01:17:49.752
It's the spiritual.

01:17:51.101 --> 01:17:53.625
She's still
kidding, isn't she?

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:54.844
- Cheers!

01:17:54.887 --> 01:17:56.236
- You can have some of mine!

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.674
Yeah, you
can have some of his!

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:01.764
Dad, what do you
think her deal is?

01:18:01.807 --> 01:18:05.332
- I don't know, that is
strange, but beautiful.

01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:08.684
- Where to next?

01:18:35.319 --> 01:18:36.146
Excuse me.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:38.757
Know where I can find McGregor?

01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:40.367
- Who's asking?

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:41.891
- We are.

01:18:41.934 --> 01:18:44.328
Is this your Ruby Pearl, here?

01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:46.983
It's lovely.

01:18:47.026 --> 01:18:48.419
We're actually a
group of filmmakers

01:18:48.462 --> 01:18:49.855
from Los Angeles and
we were wondering

01:18:49.899 --> 01:18:52.989
if you were going somewhere.

01:18:53.032 --> 01:18:54.425
I like your boat.

01:18:58.777 --> 01:18:59.647
Is he around here?

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:02.825
- Hey, McGregor!

01:19:03.782 --> 01:19:04.565
Movie people!

01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:10.920
Ahoy!

01:19:10.963 --> 01:19:12.791
Ahoy, yourself.

01:19:12.835 --> 01:19:14.750
- Hi, my name is Houston.

01:19:14.793 --> 01:19:15.576
- Yeah.

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.145
- This is my son, Shepard.

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:20.799
- Hello.
- My beautiful actress

01:19:20.843 --> 01:19:22.148
here, Heather.

01:19:22.192 --> 01:19:24.672
And Joey is my filmmaker.

01:19:29.677 --> 01:19:31.288
- Well, McGregor is the name.

01:19:31.331 --> 01:19:33.377
What can I do for you, blokes?

01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:35.292
- Is this your boat?

01:19:35.335 --> 01:19:37.250
- The Ruby Pearl, oh yeah.

01:19:37.294 --> 01:19:41.646
She's all mine now, sadly,
but I'll proudly accept her.

01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:45.911
Used to be called by me partner
Leonard, Leonard Hunter.

01:19:45.955 --> 01:19:47.565
Ah, what a sailor he was.
- Leonard Hunter?

01:19:47.608 --> 01:19:50.263
- The finest sailor to sail
the Seven Seas as ever lived.

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:54.354
That is until he met up with
the old skull and crossbones.

01:19:54.398 --> 01:19:56.313
I'll tell you, took the hand of

01:19:56.356 --> 01:19:57.836
some evil jolly roger for sure.

01:19:59.055 --> 01:20:00.752
What can I do for
you land lovers?

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:02.319
- Can you tell us
about the treasure?

01:20:02.362 --> 01:20:03.102
- Which one?

01:20:03.146 --> 01:20:04.887
- There's more than one?

01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:08.716
- Let me educate you,
my sweet little lass.

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.675
There's more gold and silver out

01:20:10.718 --> 01:20:13.112
in that ocean there
then all the land

01:20:13.156 --> 01:20:16.681
your pretty little high
heels can stand on.

01:20:16.724 --> 01:20:18.683
For 25 years, I've
searched shipwrecks and

01:20:18.726 --> 01:20:22.295
Spanish plate fleets that
have sailed from Spain back

01:20:22.339 --> 01:20:24.950
to the New World that's
been lost at sea.

01:20:24.994 --> 01:20:26.778
I've snarled with more
galleons protected

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:30.216
by their skeletons than
I care to remember.

01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:35.265
But all the while pulling up
unimaginable amounts of bounty.

01:20:36.353 --> 01:20:37.267
- Within the
Western mother load?

01:20:38.572 --> 01:20:40.487
What do you
know about that, boy?

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:44.796
- You know, pieces of
eight, gold doubloons,

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:49.801
Columbian emeralds,
a few diamonds the size of strawberries.

01:20:50.758 --> 01:20:52.151
- There's an old
- red skies

01:20:52.195 --> 01:20:55.938
at night, sailors delight.
- Delight.

01:20:55.981 --> 01:21:00.116
Red sky in the
morning, sailors take warning.

01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:02.814
- Yeah, but it was
red skies all right.

01:21:03.771 --> 01:21:06.687
But Old Leonard, yeah,
Leonard stayed put.

01:21:06.731 --> 01:21:08.994
He didn't even twitch a muscle.

01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:11.997
Must have felt in his
bones a storm were brewing.

01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:14.565
Now stubbornly we
stayed our course.

01:21:14.608 --> 01:21:17.829
That surely being
responsible for our survival.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:22.878
And then the morning came.

01:21:23.791 --> 01:21:27.056
Everything was quiet,
hurricane passed.

01:21:27.099 --> 01:21:29.667
Old Leonard took to
the warm waters below.

01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:32.104
That's when he first
picked up the sun rays.

01:21:32.148 --> 01:21:33.758
Seeing something shiny.

01:21:33.801 --> 01:21:37.588
Gold bars, gold bars under the
west stern, hundreds of 'em.

01:21:37.631 --> 01:21:40.069
Piled as high as
buzzards on a shit wagon.

01:21:40.112 --> 01:21:44.725
Well, me, I was detoured East
about 50 feet off the bow.

01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:46.379
I was by a hungry shark.

01:21:46.423 --> 01:21:48.904
And that's when I discovered
something hard and dark.

01:21:48.947 --> 01:21:50.514
A treasure chest.

01:21:51.819 --> 01:21:54.822
That belonging to he
Nuestra mother load.

01:21:54.866 --> 01:21:56.215
I just had to tip me
hat off to that shark.

01:21:56.259 --> 01:21:59.218
If it wasn't for her,
I'd have never found it.

01:21:59.262 --> 01:22:00.480
God love her.

01:22:00.524 --> 01:22:02.178
- Please go on,
this is fascinating.

01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:05.529
- Oh, the next day Leonard
took the treasure to our shop.

01:22:05.572 --> 01:22:06.704
Said he was meeting some wealthy

01:22:06.747 --> 01:22:09.359
museum curator from overseas.

01:22:09.402 --> 01:22:11.361
I don't know, the guy
was claiming he wanted

01:22:11.404 --> 01:22:14.973
to showcase the treasure in
his museums across Europe.

01:22:15.017 --> 01:22:20.022
That's when I found Leonard,
dead, cold-blooded murder.

01:22:21.849 --> 01:22:24.896
Treasure chest gone, no sign of

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.898
the filthy bastard that did it.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:27.986
- We found him.

01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:31.729
Adolf Himmler,
dead as a doornail.

01:22:31.772 --> 01:22:32.948
We found him buried.

01:22:34.514 --> 01:22:36.038
- Who are you people?

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:37.996
- Well, it's a little too
hard to explain right now,

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.780
but, McGregor, I
think I got something

01:22:39.824 --> 01:22:41.739
here that belongs to you.

01:22:41.782 --> 01:22:42.958
- What's that?

01:22:52.793 --> 01:22:53.533
Oh.

01:22:56.232 --> 01:22:59.975
Well, stiffen me crotch, hah!

01:23:00.018 --> 01:23:02.455
I'll be a wet sponge off of
the arse of a nor'wester.

01:23:02.499 --> 01:23:03.761
The mother load!

01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:07.939
Nice work, boys.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.549
Very nice.

01:23:14.511 --> 01:23:16.904
- Boy, I guess our
work is done here.

01:23:16.948 --> 01:23:17.818
- McGregor, it was
nice to meet you.

01:23:17.862 --> 01:23:19.429
You take care now.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.998
- Hold on, mate.

01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:23.824
Get back here.

01:23:25.261 --> 01:23:28.655
Your work may be finished,
but our's just begun.

01:23:28.699 --> 01:23:29.917
Winxy.

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:41.320
- Houston, darling, I
knew I could count on you.

01:23:42.582 --> 01:23:43.453
You see, darling,
didn't I tell you

01:23:43.496 --> 01:23:46.760
he has the most wonderful eyes?

01:23:46.804 --> 01:23:49.850
- You would never have found
the Esperanza without him.

01:23:49.894 --> 01:23:53.767
- Now be a good husband and
pour some hogshead for everyone.

01:23:53.811 --> 01:23:56.118
It's over 300 years old.

01:23:56.161 --> 01:23:56.944
- Your wife?

01:23:56.988 --> 01:23:57.989
- Yes, my wife.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:23:59.643
She's a great one, at that.

01:23:59.686 --> 01:24:02.254
You know what, she
finds all the treasure.

01:24:02.298 --> 01:24:04.865
But I gotta admit, I
was having a tough time

01:24:04.909 --> 01:24:07.564
tracking our sweet
Esperanza this time.

01:24:07.607 --> 01:24:09.044
- It's true.

01:24:10.306 --> 01:24:12.221
- And for the gorgeous ladies.

01:24:12.264 --> 01:24:13.091
For you, for you.

01:24:14.527 --> 01:24:16.312
A toast.

01:24:16.355 --> 01:24:17.965
To kindred spirits.

01:24:18.923 --> 01:24:20.925
- Kindred spirits

01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:27.279
- Now, everyone dig
into the treasure!

01:24:28.150 --> 01:24:30.326
- Go on, go ahead.

01:24:30.369 --> 01:24:31.675
She wants you all to dig in and

01:24:31.718 --> 01:24:32.850
take what's rightfully yours.

01:24:32.893 --> 01:24:33.894
- You're shitting us, right?

01:24:33.938 --> 01:24:35.200
- No way.

01:24:35.244 --> 01:24:37.420
- Please, my husband and
I have more than enough

01:24:37.463 --> 01:24:39.117
jewels and doubloons
for ourselves.

01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:41.467
We insist, take your share!

01:24:47.995 --> 01:24:51.477
- Snookums, they're
still being stubborn!

01:24:52.435 --> 01:24:54.132
- You scary little scallywags.

01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:55.916
Would you be wanting
your treasure

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.310
or would you rather be keyholed?

01:24:59.529 --> 01:25:01.922
- Yo ho ho, we'll have
them walk the plank!

01:25:01.966 --> 01:25:03.576
- Aye, the better.

01:25:04.447 --> 01:25:05.535
- Yes, go on.

01:25:09.887 --> 01:25:11.149
- This?

01:25:11.193 --> 01:25:12.672
- A little bit more,
you greedy cockroach.

01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:18.461
- Joey.

01:25:18.504 --> 01:25:20.941
- I don't need much, I just.

01:25:21.986 --> 01:25:23.292
- Chip?

01:25:23.335 --> 01:25:25.032
- Go ahead, dude.
- Might as well.

01:25:27.078 --> 01:25:29.515
Mine's bigger than yours.

01:25:29.559 --> 01:25:30.864
How about
you, beautiful eyes?

01:25:30.908 --> 01:25:32.431
- Oh, not me, I'm not
one to take advantage,

01:25:32.475 --> 01:25:34.651
but thanks anyway.

01:25:34.694 --> 01:25:36.914
- Shepard, would you
please do me a favor

01:25:36.957 --> 01:25:40.091
and take an extra big
handful for your lovely Dad?

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.745
- Will you hold this?

01:25:41.788 --> 01:25:43.181
Don't judge.

01:25:43.225 --> 01:25:44.226
- Extra big.

01:25:47.011 --> 01:25:50.145
There's still so much
treasure that's left.

01:25:50.188 --> 01:25:51.276
Now we just have
to figure out what

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.104
charity we want to donate it to.

01:25:54.061 --> 01:25:55.585
- Listen, I want you
guys to stay in touch

01:25:55.628 --> 01:25:58.544
with us because kindred
spirits are hard to come by.

01:25:59.893 --> 01:26:01.112
- Come here.

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:01.939
Oh!

01:26:03.114 --> 01:26:05.116
So good to see you again.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:05.986
Darling.

01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:06.900
- McGregor.
- Yes.

01:26:06.944 --> 01:26:07.727
- Take care of yourself, pal.

01:26:07.771 --> 01:26:09.076
- Ah, you know, matey.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.904
Listen, you come back quickly.

01:26:10.948 --> 01:26:13.037
We'll do a little swashbuckling.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:16.301
You come back.
- Of course, of course.

01:26:16.345 --> 01:26:17.476
Hey, Houston.

01:26:18.434 --> 01:26:20.697
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

01:26:25.528 --> 01:26:27.791
- You know, I'm really
gonna miss you guys.

01:26:32.056 --> 01:26:33.188
I had a lotta fun.

01:26:34.276 --> 01:26:35.842
- Heather, what are
you talking about?

01:26:35.886 --> 01:26:37.453
You know we're gonna see
each other tomorrow, right?

01:26:38.758 --> 01:26:40.325
Oh, yeah.

01:26:40.369 --> 01:26:42.371
We gotta look through all the
footage and start editing.

01:26:42.414 --> 01:26:44.068
I forgot.

01:26:44.111 --> 01:26:45.069
We'll see
you tomorrow, Heather.

01:26:45.112 --> 01:26:46.113
- Alright, bye.

01:26:46.157 --> 01:26:47.376
Okay, bye.

01:26:47.419 --> 01:26:48.681
Don't
let any of your

01:26:48.725 --> 01:26:50.117
six roommates see
those diamonds.

01:26:50.161 --> 01:26:51.597
- Yeah, yeah right!

01:26:53.077 --> 01:26:53.947
Bye.

01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:55.819
Poor girl was all emotional.

01:26:55.862 --> 01:27:00.780
You see that?

01:27:02.086 --> 01:27:03.740
Hey, Houston, you
can drop me off right here.

01:27:03.783 --> 01:27:05.089
What?

01:27:05.132 --> 01:27:06.569
Anywhere,
just drop me off.

01:27:06.612 --> 01:27:07.831
You serious?

01:27:07.874 --> 01:27:09.049
Yeah, this
spot, pull over.

01:27:09.093 --> 01:27:11.095
Okay.

01:27:11.138 --> 01:27:13.053
Houston, are
you gonna stop or not?

01:27:14.272 --> 01:27:15.055
We got a flat?

01:27:15.099 --> 01:27:16.318
What's wrong?

01:27:16.361 --> 01:27:19.016
What are
you talking about?

01:27:19.059 --> 01:27:22.411
- Where is he going?
- We're stopping here.

01:27:25.936 --> 01:27:27.024
What's he doing?

01:27:27.067 --> 01:27:28.112
- Thanks for
everything, you guys.

01:27:28.155 --> 01:27:29.287
I'll see you later, okay?

01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:30.549
Where are you going?

01:27:30.593 --> 01:27:31.942
- Dude, dude, what
are you doing?

01:27:31.985 --> 01:27:33.552
You don't live here.

01:27:35.075 --> 01:27:37.339
- I'll make 'em an offer.

01:27:37.382 --> 01:27:38.296
- What if they don't wanna sell?

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.602
- They must take diamonds.

01:27:39.645 --> 01:27:40.820
- Good luck.

01:27:40.864 --> 01:27:42.257
See you later.
- See you tomorrow.

01:27:45.521 --> 01:27:46.652
- What a character.

01:27:48.915 --> 01:27:50.482
Hey, where are we going?

01:27:50.526 --> 01:27:52.223
- The weirdo widow.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.181
- Hey, we never paid the bill.

01:27:57.489 --> 01:28:02.059
What do you think the next
film's gonna be about?

01:28:02.102 --> 01:28:04.757
- Is there life after death?

01:28:04.801 --> 01:28:05.584
- Hm.

01:28:06.846 --> 01:28:08.239
What do you think?

01:28:09.545 --> 01:28:11.764
- I have no idea.

01:28:11.808 --> 01:28:12.591
- Yet.
