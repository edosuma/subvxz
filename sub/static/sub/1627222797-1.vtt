it's been kind of weird here.

47:45.204 --> 47:47.008
We're about to leave, actually.

47:47.041 --> 47:48.277
‐ Wait, what? Why?
Where you gonna go?

47:48.310 --> 47:50.047
‐ Back to the city till I can

47:50.081 --> 47:51.383
find someplace else
for me to go write.

47:51.416 --> 47:53.053
‐ Okay, uh, Harry?

47:53.087 --> 47:54.657
No fucking way.

47:54.690 --> 47:56.326
You need to stay there

47:56.359 --> 47:58.531
and finish your pilot,
like, yesterday.

47:58.565 --> 47:59.934
‐ I know, I'm just‐‐

47:59.967 --> 48:01.136
I'm really not feeling it yet.

48:01.169 --> 48:03.440
‐ Okay, Harry, I'm gonna
speak straight to you.

48:03.474 --> 48:06.079
Fuck you really hard
right up the ass.

48:06.113 --> 48:07.315
Not feeling it?

48:07.348 --> 48:09.185
Rappers are allowed
to not feel it.

48:09.219 --> 48:11.490
Uh, girlfriends
commenting on clothes

48:11.524 --> 48:14.462
their friends are trying on
are allowed to not feel it.

48:14.497 --> 48:16.299
You are a professional writer,

48:16.333 --> 48:18.203
and you feel it
when the work bell rings,

48:18.237 --> 48:19.940
every time.

48:19.974 --> 48:21.476
‐ What's the difference
if the pilot's done now

48:21.511 --> 48:23.113
or six months from now?

48:25.251 --> 48:27.689
‐ Okay, Harry, I'm gonna
speak even straighter to you.

48:27.723 --> 48:29.927
Do you understand
that the job you used to have

48:29.960 --> 48:31.964
literally
does not exist anymore?

48:31.998 --> 48:34.169
I mean, co‐EP on some
network procedural?

48:34.202 --> 48:36.106
Those shows are dinosaurs.

48:36.139 --> 48:38.043
If you want to continue being
a professional writer,

48:38.076 --> 48:40.114
you've gotta create
your own thing.

48:40.147 --> 48:42.084
Now. Today.

48:43.688 --> 48:46.092
Look buddy,
you know I love you, okay?

48:46.126 --> 48:47.563
But if you screw this up,

48:47.596 --> 48:49.232
it's gonna take you
years to recover

48:49.265 --> 48:50.502
if you ever even do.

48:50.535 --> 48:53.474
Goodbye. Go write.
