WEBVTT

00:06.800 --> 00:08.392
Go ahead.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.408
That's your copy.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.705
I think you'll
find it tough, but honest.

00:13.740 --> 00:16.106
Your peers thought you were
professional and diligent.

00:16.150 --> 00:19.278
But some also found you...
a bit standoffish,

00:19.320 --> 00:22.710
and felt you kept
leisurely hours.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.082
Just think of it
as a progress report,

00:25.120 --> 00:27.179
a way to point
towards improvement.

00:27.220 --> 00:29.620
Improving my standoffishness?

00:29.660 --> 00:32.356
Can I offer some advice, Alicia?

00:32.400 --> 00:33.799
Take this seriously.

00:33.830 --> 00:36.390
There's
some worth there.

00:36.430 --> 00:39.831
And the partners want your peers
to determine future pay

00:39.870 --> 00:41.292
and advancement...

00:41.340 --> 00:42.466
Okay, let's go.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.568
Excuse me?

00:43.610 --> 00:46.135
I-I need Alicia.
Let's go.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.774
Actually... we're not finished.

00:48.810 --> 00:50.346
Oh, yes, peer review.

00:50.380 --> 00:51.642
How adorable.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.045
Let's go.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.579
DAVID:
Oh,

00:56.620 --> 00:57.746
you're staring at me.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.382
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

01:00.420 --> 01:01.489
1245 Loop.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.124
Meet me in the lobby.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.151
Don't dawdle.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.828
Where was I?

01:08.860 --> 01:11.328
Take this seriously.

01:11.370 --> 01:13.463
DAVID:
Portman & Michaels.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.138
Holland, Charmin & Day.

01:15.170 --> 01:16.501
Carlington & Associates.

01:16.540 --> 01:17.666
Hey, Bethany.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.337
Great day for
a bake off.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.336
David, you left
your big guns at home.

01:21.380 --> 01:23.473
Where are Will, Diane?

01:23.510 --> 01:25.705
My God, you're right.
What was I thinking?

01:25.750 --> 01:28.514
I heard she listened to five
words from Bellows & Greenberg

01:28.550 --> 01:29.881
and kicked them out.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.239
I'm surprised she
gave them five.

01:31.290 --> 01:32.382
Alicia! Why, there you are.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.456
Ah, the celebrity factor.
Of course.

01:34.490 --> 01:36.549
Good luck, Bethany.

01:36.590 --> 01:38.182
Hey, we only have a minute.

01:38.230 --> 01:40.551
The real key here
is the $31 million divorce,

01:40.600 --> 01:42.192
but there's also a DUI.

01:42.230 --> 01:43.367
Randall.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.526
Happened last night.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.197
Just say some bright
words about DUIs

01:46.240 --> 01:47.798
and don't overburden

01:47.840 --> 01:49.137
the presentation.

01:49.170 --> 01:51.161
Their real worry
is the 31 million.

01:51.210 --> 01:52.507
I'm sorry, who are we...?

01:52.540 --> 01:54.303
She's ready for you.
Just two.

01:54.340 --> 01:55.568
Tim, Randall, you stay.

01:55.610 --> 01:57.248
Alicia, let's go.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.214
(phone ringing)

01:59.250 --> 02:01.514
You'll have to turn
off cells in the room.

02:02.950 --> 02:04.645
Hi, Peter.
I'm going into a meeting.

02:04.690 --> 02:07.284
Hey, I just wanted to see
if you could hit lunch today.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.151
Why?
Is everything all right?

02:09.190 --> 02:12.159
Well, the Democratic Committee
asked for a meeting.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.292
Peter, that's great.

02:13.330 --> 02:15.252
Talk about calling in
the cavalry.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.269
The campaign is just
about out of money.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.938
Eli, no one's
listening.

02:19.970 --> 02:22.200
Hey, how did that
peer review go?

02:22.240 --> 02:23.502
I'll tell you later.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.508
I'm going into a meeting now.
Okay. Bye.

02:25.540 --> 02:28.429
Don't mention
the bulimia.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.471
David Lee from
Lockhart, Gardner, Bond.

02:30.510 --> 02:31.909
(laughs)

02:31.950 --> 02:34.168
Your name's not above
the title, Mr. Lee.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.313
Everybody else
sent partners.
Everybody else

02:36.350 --> 02:38.489
sent people who will abandon you
after the first meeting.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.784
Photos at 5:30,

02:40.820 --> 02:42.321
after court.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.453
Mrs. Burchfield, this is
my associate, Alicia Florrick.

02:44.490 --> 02:45.855
MRS. BURCHFIELD:
Milla! Sloan!

02:45.890 --> 02:47.426
Sandwiches!

02:47.460 --> 02:49.519
I think you might
recognize her

02:49.570 --> 02:51.526
from her husband's
scandal last year.

02:51.570 --> 02:53.697
Uh, Peter Florrick.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.799
Would you like to sit?

02:55.840 --> 02:57.831
Yes, thank you.

02:58.870 --> 03:01.202
Now I've been looking over

03:01.240 --> 03:03.379
your ex-husband's complaint,
and I would suggest

03:03.410 --> 03:06.208
a spousal maintenance of

03:06.250 --> 03:07.376
$300,000 a year.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.388
How do I insulate
the 31 million?

03:09.420 --> 03:10.739
DAVID: _
It's not yours to split.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.451
It's your daughter's.
The...

03:12.490 --> 03:15.687
Oh, go ahead. My daughters
know all about it.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.256
I draw up a trust,

03:17.290 --> 03:19.349
protecting the cash
from both parents.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.325
This will be our little fiction
to protect the money from him.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.292
He stays running
his restaurant in L.A.,

03:25.330 --> 03:27.764
you maintain control
of the money

03:27.800 --> 03:28.937
through your daughter.

03:28.970 --> 03:30.267
WOMAN:
And my DUI?

03:30.310 --> 03:32.278
DAVID:
It just so happens

03:32.310 --> 03:34.699
that Alicia here has handled

03:34.740 --> 03:36.776
some _of our most
complicated DUIs.

03:36.810 --> 03:39.278
So how much trouble am I in?

03:39.320 --> 03:40.969
A lot.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.285
Really?

03:44.320 --> 03:46.459
The other guys thought
it was an easy dismissal.

03:46.490 --> 03:48.811
This is your third DUI.

03:48.860 --> 03:51.328
They were just trying not
to scare you.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.793
SLOAN:
Two were in California.

03:52.830 --> 03:54.320
ALICIA: It doesn't matter.
The State's Attorney

03:54.360 --> 03:55.759
is gonna want
a felony conviction

03:55.800 --> 03:58.564
and 25 days at Cook County
to use you as an example.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.737
It's an election year.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.795
You've achieved...

04:01.840 --> 04:03.705
the wrong kind of fame.

04:04.740 --> 04:06.833
That was diplomatic.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.405
I'm trying very hard.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.270
And if you weren't
trying so hard?

04:11.310 --> 04:13.369
I would say,

04:13.420 --> 04:15.342
this is not L.A.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.679
People here are less forgiving
about underage drinking.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.359
So you're famous?

04:21.390 --> 04:23.426
No.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.451
MRS. BURCHFIELD:
She's the wife of
that guy last year

04:25.490 --> 04:26.491
who resigned.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.555
With the prostitute?

04:28.600 --> 04:30.693
Do you have kids?

04:32.070 --> 04:34.038
Yes.

04:34.070 --> 04:35.935
Do they want autographs?

04:35.970 --> 04:39.428
DAVID: Funny, that's just what
Alicia was saying on the way up.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.970
She just didn't want to be rude.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.407
(laughs)

04:45.450 --> 04:47.418
You got to love the law.

04:47.450 --> 04:48.769
(laughs quietly)

04:48.820 --> 04:51.448
Alicia... good job.

04:51.490 --> 04:53.458
Thank you.

04:53.490 --> 04:55.913
Mr. Lee, can I ask...

04:55.960 --> 04:57.928
this peer review
for Mr. Bond...

04:57.960 --> 04:59.689
Oh, yeah, forget it.

04:59.730 --> 05:02.699
Small-minded people
making small-minded decisions.

05:02.730 --> 05:05.324
Yes, but I heard they're
basing our salaries on it.

05:05.370 --> 05:08.362
Could you talk to him
and tell him how I did?

05:08.400 --> 05:10.436
No. I don't like him.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.472
But good job anyway.

05:16.510 --> 05:18.341
PETER:
So Rahm, huh?

05:18.380 --> 05:20.610
(chuckling):
Yeah, Rahm.

05:20.650 --> 05:23.710
The fun never ceases.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.547
So, Frank, we hope this means

05:25.590 --> 05:28.514
that the Democratic Committee
IS coming off the Sidelines.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.380
We are, actually.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.058
Good. A three-way
race is a bad thing.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.499
We agree.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.395
That's why we need you
to drop out.

05:36.430 --> 05:39.399
We don't want
Wendy Scott-Carr in.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.668
She's a loose canon.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.361
She's trying to
jump the line.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.502
Then tell Childs to drop out.

05:43.540 --> 05:44.507
You're the ones down

05:44.540 --> 05:45.529
five points in the polls.

05:45.570 --> 05:46.969
But look at the trend.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.534
The trend can kiss my ass.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.377
Look, Peter,
we like you.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.378
But let's be honest.
Childs is the incumbent.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.149
He's got the power
of the office.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.477
And you're counting

05:55.520 --> 05:56.885
on African-American
votes to wrn, right?

05:56.920 --> 05:58.148
You're making a mistake.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.418
Peter, if you were
in my position,

05:59.460 --> 06:00.757
you'd make the same one.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.951
Wendy siphons off
your black votes,

06:02.990 --> 06:04.628
you and Childs split the
white vote, and she wins,

06:04.660 --> 06:05.957
all you do is
play spoiler?

06:05.990 --> 06:08.424
Be a good soldier.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.496
We'll guarantee you
my job in six months.

06:12.770 --> 06:13.964
That's right.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.638
The Howard Dean deal.

06:15.670 --> 06:17.661
Yours for
the taking.

06:20.110 --> 06:21.577
(gavel bangs over
indistinct conversation)

06:21.610 --> 06:22.747
JUDGE:
Okay, okay.

06:22.780 --> 06:24.645
Hold it down, please.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.671
Very simply,

06:26.720 --> 06:29.644
Ms. Burchfield's blood alcohol
measured .14,

06:29.690 --> 06:31.442
almost twice the legal limit.

06:31.490 --> 06:33.811
Now, I don't care
how Mrs. Florrick dresses her...

06:33.860 --> 06:34.986
Objection.
Sustained.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.419
...it still indicates

06:36.460 --> 06:38.018
a flagrant disregard
for the law.

06:38.060 --> 06:40.096
We ask for 45 days

06:40.130 --> 06:41.757
in Cook County jail.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.529
Your Honor, according
to the police intake report,

06:43.570 --> 06:45.526
my client's blood alcohol
was only tested at the hospital

06:45.570 --> 06:46.969
two hours after the accident...

06:47.000 --> 06:49.503
ATTORNEY: Yes, and our
experts used retrograde

06:49.540 --> 06:52.475
extrapolation, a widely-accepted
mathematical formula

06:52.510 --> 06:54.102
for determining blood alcohol.

06:54.140 --> 06:55.698
A formula _
that requrres screening

06:55.740 --> 06:57.503
for extraneous variables.

06:57.550 --> 06:58.699
And what variables
were not screened?

06:58.750 --> 07:00.513
My client's bulimia.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.745
Bulimia causes
hypoglycemia,

07:03.790 --> 07:06.452
which affects the way
the body processes alcohol.

07:06.490 --> 07:09.584
The plain fact
is that the prosecution

07:09.630 --> 07:11.086
can't tell
whether my client was drunk

07:11.130 --> 07:13.451
at the time of the accident
or merely starVIng.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.559
Oh, Your Honor, come on!
Bulimia as an excuse

07:15.600 --> 07:16.726
for drunk driving?!

07:16.770 --> 07:18.988
We demand that
the blood alc...

07:21.540 --> 07:22.962
Bulimia, huh?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.966
I don't know
what's going on right now,

07:25.010 --> 07:28.207
but whatever happens,
don't say a word.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.504
Sloan Burchfield,

07:30.550 --> 07:32.199
you're under arrest
for attempted murder.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.639
A Class X felony with a
minimum sentence of six years.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.238
Oh, my God.
ALICIA:
Oh, come on, Cary.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.941
Don't you think that's
overreaching just a little bit?

07:37.990 --> 07:39.719
Ms. Yarissa Morgan
is in the hospital

07:39.760 --> 07:41.489
with four broken ribs
after Ms. Burchfield

07:41.520 --> 07:43.488
attempted to murder her
with her vehicle last night.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.020
That's not overreach.
That's attempted murder.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.021
Six years.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.969
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

08:05.280 --> 08:08.670
So, Eli's trying
to cobble together some loans,

08:08.720 --> 08:13.214
and he wants to know how much
we'll put up for the campaign.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.251
I said, at this
point, nothing.

08:16.290 --> 08:18.850
But if I took
this job...
(girls giggling)

08:18.890 --> 08:20.596
In a sec, okay, hon?

08:20.630 --> 08:22.996
Sorry. Hey, come on.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.998
If I took this job--

08:25.030 --> 08:27.567
Chairman
of the Democratic Committee--

08:27.600 --> 08:31.604
it pays $400,000 a year,

08:31.640 --> 08:33.574
you wouldn't have to work.

08:36.310 --> 08:38.107
I'd barely
have to work.

08:38.150 --> 08:42.109
It's basically a payoff
to have me drop out.

08:42.150 --> 08:44.789
But it's a
lot of money.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.754
What do you think?

08:47.790 --> 08:49.724
What do you think?

08:49.760 --> 08:51.751
I hate it.

08:51.790 --> 08:54.657
Then don't drop out. Run.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.227
If you have to xerox pamphlets
at Kinko's, do it.

08:59.270 --> 09:01.135
I have to go to work.

09:01.170 --> 09:03.229
Hey...

09:04.240 --> 09:06.231
Thank you.

09:12.980 --> 09:14.971
(woman narrating in Chinese
on computer)

09:16.950 --> 09:19.851
GRACE:
What is this?

09:19.890 --> 09:20.754
Some Taiwanese channel.

09:20.790 --> 09:22.781
They were showing
it at Campus Faith.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.855
It's about Sloan
getting arrested

09:24.890 --> 09:27.222
for trying to kill
Yarissa Morgan.

09:28.730 --> 09:30.960
You should see the one
they did of Tiger Woods.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.888
Do they do it
on every scandal?

09:32.940 --> 09:34.635
No, just the big ones.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.562
(laughter)
Oh, my gosh.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.075
I wonder if they'll
show your mom.

09:42.110 --> 09:43.668
My mom? Why?

09:43.710 --> 09:45.769
You know, as her lavwer.

09:45.810 --> 09:46.845
(laughs)

09:46.880 --> 09:48.711
You'll be famous.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.389
Oh, right, yeah.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.308
(tires screeching)

09:53.360 --> 09:56.386
You have to get your mom
to introduce us.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.887
To Sloan? Why?

09:57.930 --> 09:59.625
She's so, like, Disney Channel.

09:59.660 --> 10:00.820
Not anymore.

10:00.860 --> 10:02.964
Didn't you see that stuff
on TMZ?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.024
The lap dance?

10:05.830 --> 10:07.229
(crying on computer)

10:07.270 --> 10:09.363
Oh, my God, that's...

10:09.400 --> 10:11.265
that's your mom's arm.
You're famous.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.902
No.

10:12.940 --> 10:13.838
No, your mother's arm

10:13.880 --> 10:15.006
is famous.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.644
(laughing)
Right.

10:16.680 --> 10:17.908
SLOAN
Who the hell are you?!

10:17.950 --> 10:19.815
YARISSA:
I'm his girlfriend,

10:19.850 --> 10:21.772
you stupid skank!
Who the hell are you?

10:21.820 --> 10:23.048
(overlapping shouting)

10:23.090 --> 10:25.945
(indistinct shouting,
dance music playing)

10:30.130 --> 10:32.280
It was anonymously recorded
at The Quarters,

10:32.330 --> 10:33.957
a club on West Illinois.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.423
Police say the fight
was with Yarissa Morgan,

10:36.460 --> 10:37.961
the daughter of...

10:38.000 --> 10:39.365
Greg Morgan.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.936
Bulls point guard.

10:40.970 --> 10:44.030
1999 to 2004.

10:44.070 --> 10:46.937
_ Yar_issa was
mtoxrcated and

10:46.980 --> 10:49.232
decided to sleep it off
in her parked BMW.

10:49.280 --> 10:53.239
Sloan, according to police,
got into her black Escalade

10:53.280 --> 10:55.669
and rammed it three times.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.143
After, Sloan drove off

10:58.190 --> 10:59.919
for five miles, and
then wrapped her Escalade

10:59.960 --> 11:01.052
around a fire hydrant.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.387
DIANE:
What does she say?

11:02.420 --> 11:04.024
Sloan? She just made bond.

11:04.060 --> 11:05.925
I'm questioning her
this afternoon.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.326
With a partner.
This was a $30 million divorce

11:08.360 --> 11:09.998
with a DUI afterthought.

11:10.030 --> 11:11.964
Now it's attempted murder.
Divorce is on hold.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.831
I'll go.

11:13.870 --> 11:15.929
Don't you have all those
important peer reviews to do?

11:17.440 --> 11:19.237
WILL:
No, I'll do it.

11:19.270 --> 11:20.407
I love Sloan.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.907
DIANE:
Big fan, are you?

11:21.940 --> 11:23.009
Haven't you heard?

11:23.050 --> 11:23.948
She's not just for kids anymore.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.847
We should check
if Yarissa had other enemies

11:26.880 --> 11:28.472
at the club.
With no witnesses,

11:28.520 --> 11:30.010
we could argue someone else
destroyed her car.

11:30.050 --> 11:31.483
Also, it's only
attempted murder

11:31.520 --> 11:34.887
if Sloan knew that Yarissa
was sleeping In her car.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.012
Right. It's criminal damage

11:36.060 --> 11:36.754
to property if she thought

11:36.790 --> 11:38.018
she was just
destroying her car.

11:38.060 --> 11:41.029
Good, I'll look for witnesses.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.891
* You're no rock and roll fun

11:42.930 --> 11:45.023
* Like a party that's over

11:45.070 --> 11:46.867
* Before it's begun...

11:46.900 --> 11:49.960
Like a general waiting
on an eight-year-old king.

11:50.010 --> 11:53.377
I heard peer review
was rough.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.799
A bit.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.979
How important is it?

11:58.010 --> 11:58.999
I don't know.

11:59.050 --> 12:00.278
We're trying
to figure that out.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.049
You think it's stupid?

12:02.080 --> 12:05.516
I think it encourages people

12:05.550 --> 12:09.350
to denigrate each other
to save their jobs.

12:09.390 --> 12:11.358
I read your reviews.

12:12.830 --> 12:15.151
You didn't.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.361
(door opens)

12:18.400 --> 12:19.958
So...

12:20.000 --> 12:21.797
you guys are the lavwers?

12:21.840 --> 12:24.968
Yep. And you're
the entourage.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.137
I'm Corey.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.102
So, if you know
someone's lying,

12:29.140 --> 12:31.074
you can't put them
on the stand, right?

12:31.110 --> 12:33.874
You can't knowingly
put someone on the stand

12:33.920 --> 12:37.014
to perjure themselves.
Why?

12:37.050 --> 12:38.187
So it's just best
not to know?

12:38.220 --> 12:39.983
There you are.

12:40.020 --> 12:40.987
Alicia.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.920
My God,
what a day.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.928
Mrs. Burchfield, this is one of
our partners, Will Gardner.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.894
Oh, hello.

12:46.930 --> 12:48.295
I'm so glad
you're here.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.161
Milla was just
telling us something.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.065
I was...

12:52.100 --> 12:53.931
I was at the club, too.

12:53.970 --> 12:56.291
I went there because Sloan
called and sounded tipsy.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.399
Paige asked me to
drive Sloan home.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.976
Paige?
Who's Paige?

13:00.010 --> 13:02.035
MRS. BURCHFIELD:
Me. We're just informal here.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.105
Tell them what
you heard.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.539
This Yarissa girl,

13:06.580 --> 13:08.138
she said she was going
to the bathroom

13:08.180 --> 13:10.284
to do coke, not her car.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.482
So, you don't
remember anything

13:14.520 --> 13:17.387
from when you fought
with Yarissa at the club

13:17.430 --> 13:18.556
till when you woke up
in the hospital?

13:18.590 --> 13:21.024
Yeah. I sort
of blacked out.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.198
And at what point did you see
your sister at the club?

13:26.870 --> 13:28.132
Milla?

13:28.170 --> 13:29.489
Yeah, she said
she was there.

13:29.540 --> 13:32.532
That Paige sent her
to pick you up.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.076
Don't put her
on the stand, okay?

13:36.110 --> 13:37.941
They would say anything
to keep me out of jail.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.016
We're opting
for a bench trial.

13:40.050 --> 13:42.177
A jury would be too
quick to prejudge.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.141
Thank you,
Ms. Burchfield.

13:45.550 --> 13:47.154
Did you like my song?

13:47.190 --> 13:49.055
Did I...

13:49.090 --> 13:51.251
The one you just played?

13:51.290 --> 13:52.450
Yeah, I did.

13:52.490 --> 13:55.152
I'm trying to party less.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.191
Good.
It's just part of the whole

13:57.230 --> 13:59.198
climbing out of the
Disney ghetto thing.

14:01.400 --> 14:05.564
My look's too... innocent.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.237
MANAGER:
Sloan?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.406
Time to get into uniform.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.916
(playing piano)

14:23.960 --> 14:26.053
Hello, Mr. Gold.

14:26.090 --> 14:28.456
What are you doing here?

14:28.500 --> 14:31.628
I'm humbling myself.

14:31.670 --> 14:34.195
Really?

14:34.240 --> 14:36.128
That doesn't sound like you.

14:36.170 --> 14:38.058
Peter needs you.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.135
And he gets me every Tuesday
for spiritual guidance.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.306
No.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.103
He needs your endorsement.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.141
He'll lose without you.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.273
Mr. Gold, you know I don't
endorse. You know that.

14:54.190 --> 14:56.078
Eli.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.155
Pastor Easton.

14:57.190 --> 14:59.385
Just Jeremiah these days.

14:59.430 --> 15:01.159
How are you doing?
Good.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.265
Actually, not so good.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.939
I need you to talk
to your son.

15:07.970 --> 15:10.131
About an endorsement?

15:10.170 --> 15:12.206
Yes.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.231
Having problems with
Wendy Scott-Carr?

15:14.280 --> 15:16.339
Haven't lost it.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.371
It never goes away.

15:18.410 --> 15:21.948
Religion fades, not politics.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.144
Well...

15:27.120 --> 15:30.351
I can talk to him, but
my son's his own man.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.551
Anything you can do.

15:32.590 --> 15:36.356
For a friend, sure.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.560
Really?
And what are you hearing?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.227
BETHANY (on phone):
The usual garbage.

15:39.270 --> 15:40.589
Lockhart & Gardner
is breaking up.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.132
I know it's nonsense,
but it never hurts to call.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.728
It is nonsense, Bethany.

15:45.770 --> 15:49.308
I hear the same
about a dozen firms a week.

15:49.340 --> 15:51.308
I think it's a bad idea,
Derrick.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.669
Not if we handle it right.

15:52.710 --> 15:55.713
Handle what right?

15:55.750 --> 15:58.514
Derrick's heard rumblings
from Litigation

15:58.550 --> 16:00.415
about Family Law getting
a pass on peer review.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.758
DERRICK: David Lee
runs his department

16:02.790 --> 16:05.281
like a fiefdom,
and we indulge him.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.321
We indulge him
because he's making money

16:07.360 --> 16:09.021
in a down economy.

16:09.060 --> 16:10.368
We can't piss him off.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.027
DERRICK:
It's not about pissing him off.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.332
It's about being stronger
as one unit.

16:13.370 --> 16:14.496
Moving together.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.064
Diane?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.203
What do you think?

16:21.380 --> 16:23.507
I think his department
should be under peer review.

16:23.550 --> 16:27.372
We're all in this
together, right?

16:27.420 --> 16:31.015
Good. Thanks.

16:31.050 --> 16:33.052
DERRICK:
I'll get right on it.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.221
(people clamoring)

16:38.260 --> 16:39.488
(bangs gavel)

16:39.530 --> 16:41.452
Sheriff. Escort out those

16:41.500 --> 16:43.388
two gentlemen
of the press.

16:43.430 --> 16:45.694
As promised, when you disrupt
my court, you lose a seat.

16:45.730 --> 16:49.734
Think of it as our own _little
game of mu5Ical chairs.

16:49.770 --> 16:52.330
Now, this is a trial,

16:52.370 --> 16:54.031
gentlemen and ladies.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.399
It is not a show.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.409
It is not being performed
for your amusement.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.816
Likewise, counselors,
I have been informed

17:00.850 --> 17:03.239
that both the defendant
and prosecution Witnesses

17:03.290 --> 17:06.111
have been live-tweeting
this trial.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.256
You area” under
an electronic gag order.

17:09.290 --> 17:12.088
No texting, no tweeting,
no Facebook.

17:12.130 --> 17:13.097
Is that understood?

17:13.130 --> 17:14.119
Yes, Your Honor.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.229
Good. Then let's go.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.194
And you remember
clearly stating

17:17.230 --> 17:18.663
you were going
to sleep in your car?

17:18.700 --> 17:20.338
And the defendant
heard you?

17:20.370 --> 17:23.339
Yes, and she was all,
"What do I care, bitch?"

17:23.370 --> 17:26.134
And I was like, "Look,
do not start with me."

17:26.170 --> 17:27.398
Okay, I get the gist.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.341
And waking up after ten minutes
in the back seat of your car,

17:30.380 --> 17:31.802
what did you see?

17:31.850 --> 17:34.648
Her, driving her Caddy,
slamming into me.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.387
And did you see
where she went then?

17:43.390 --> 17:45.620
(shutter clicks)

17:46.730 --> 17:48.721
(shutter clicks)

17:56.340 --> 17:57.659
(phone beeps and shutter clicks)

17:57.710 --> 17:59.507
(door opens,
music plays from within)

17:59.540 --> 18:01.804
* Every time you try

18:01.840 --> 18:04.308
* I want to say good-bye

18:07.420 --> 18:09.445
* Even if you cry

18:09.480 --> 18:11.789
* Then I just tell you why

18:11.820 --> 18:14.118
* Why we're done...

18:14.160 --> 18:15.457
Hungry33?

18:15.490 --> 18:17.253
Yeah.

18:17.290 --> 18:19.121
What's up?
What's up?

18:19.160 --> 18:20.297
I'm Reserve82.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.127
Yeah, I saw you
on four booth.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.560
Yeah, I'm the mayor.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.397
Okay.

18:26.430 --> 18:28.295
So you must come here a lot.

18:28.340 --> 18:29.739
Since it opened.

18:29.770 --> 18:32.762
Were you here
when that accident happened?

18:32.810 --> 18:34.402
Oh, my God, the Sloan thing?

18:34.440 --> 18:35.702
Yeah.
Yeah.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.573
This place has been
mad jammed ever since.

18:38.610 --> 18:40.168
So you saw the fight?

18:40.220 --> 18:42.438
I had a front row seat.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.640
Whoa.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.816
Right over there.

18:44.850 --> 18:46.784
And the other one, too.

18:46.820 --> 18:48.708
Other one?
What other one?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.648
Well, between her
and her boyfriend.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.487
Sloan and her boyfriend?

18:52.530 --> 18:54.452
No, no, no. Uh, Yarissa
and her boyfriend.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.469
There was another fight?

18:57.500 --> 18:59.161
(music plays on computer)

18:59.200 --> 19:01.168
Oh, baby.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.872
(music stops)

19:28.960 --> 19:31.599
(woman narrating in Chinese)

19:36.900 --> 19:38.436
(moaning)

19:38.470 --> 19:40.472
(woman continues
narrating in Chinese)

19:46.780 --> 19:48.714
(honking, bells ringing)

19:48.750 --> 19:51.287
Yee-haw!

19:51.320 --> 19:52.742
(laughing)

19:52.790 --> 19:53.916
(people clamoring, gavel bangs)

19:53.960 --> 19:55.518
Shut up.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.528
Everyone.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.380
Sheriff, another seat.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.227
Continue, Counselor.

20:01.260 --> 20:02.557
WILL:
So no one else could have

20:02.600 --> 20:03.396
rammed into your car that night?

20:03.430 --> 20:05.694
Because you only fought
with Sloan?

20:05.730 --> 20:07.493
That's right.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.965
So you didn't fight with
your boyfriend that night?

20:14.010 --> 20:15.534
That was a personal matter.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.468
You mean, hitting your boyfriend
was a personal matter?

20:17.510 --> 20:19.842
Objection. Relevance.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.417
Your Honor, we would argue
that a fight with Ms. Morgan

20:22.450 --> 20:24.315
is not an unusual occurrence,
and there were others

20:24.350 --> 20:25.749
who had reason to hurt her.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.314
Yes, but only one who
was driving Sloan's car.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.315
And yet others who were driving

20:28.360 --> 20:29.816
black Escalades.

20:29.860 --> 20:31.487
That same night?
Um, gentlemen.

20:31.530 --> 20:32.849
If you haven't
noticed,

20:32.890 --> 20:35.893
this is a courtroom,
and I am a judge.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.966
Now, I'm going to give you
a little leeway, here,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.992
Counselor, but only
because I'm curious.

20:41.040 --> 20:41.938
The police found traces

20:41.970 --> 20:45.906
of paint from a black
Escalade on your car.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.033
But isn't it possible
that that could have come

20:48.080 --> 20:49.570
from accidents
prior to that night?

20:50.780 --> 20:52.509
I'm sorry.

20:52.550 --> 20:53.949
Does "nuh-uh" mean "no"?

20:55.080 --> 20:56.547
Then say "no."

20:56.580 --> 20:59.014
No.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.814
It was a brand-new car.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.579
And I hadn't been in
any previous accidents.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.325
This is a valet slip.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.295
It's actually your valet slip
from the night in question.

21:09.330 --> 21:10.922
You see these
marks on the back?

21:10.970 --> 21:13.939
The valet makes them
so they don't get blamed

21:13.970 --> 21:15.369
for previous damage.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.799
But those are scratches.
And dents.

21:16.840 --> 21:17.932
From previous accidents?

21:17.970 --> 21:19.767
From bumping things.

21:19.810 --> 21:21.971
Not from previous accidents.
Well, according to this,

21:22.010 --> 21:22.931
you had dents on
your front fender,

21:22.980 --> 21:23.844
both side doors, and,
most significantly,

21:23.880 --> 21:26.041
since this is where
you accuse my client

21:26.080 --> 21:27.911
of damaging your car,
on the rear fender.

21:27.950 --> 21:29.645
She did this to me.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.545
No further questions.

21:36.060 --> 21:37.948
(whispers):
You're the man.

21:37.990 --> 21:39.981
(whispers):
I am the man.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.092
Ms. Scott-Carr.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.732
We should probably talk.

21:50.770 --> 21:52.806
About what, ma'am?

21:52.840 --> 21:54.501
Your ambitions.

21:54.540 --> 21:56.030
I need you.

21:58.010 --> 22:02.947
To beat Childs, I need you
as my campaign manager.

22:02.980 --> 22:06.939
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm working for a campaign.

22:06.990 --> 22:10.949
Yes, and I probably should wait
until it's officially over,

22:10.990 --> 22:13.458
but I need
somebody now.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.424
I know the
Democratic Committee

22:16.460 --> 22:19.099
has rejected Peter, and I
know that your reserves

22:19.130 --> 22:21.633
are almost exhausted.

22:21.670 --> 22:23.661
You're asking me to abandon him?

22:23.710 --> 22:24.768
Iam.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.608
Join me.

22:36.150 --> 22:39.415
So, does she
wear panties?

22:39.450 --> 22:40.986
VVho?

22:41.020 --> 22:42.578
Does Sloan wear panties?

22:42.620 --> 22:44.429
Paris Hilton tweeted that

22:44.460 --> 22:45.950
she didn't wear panties
to court yesterday.

22:45.990 --> 22:49.596
Well, I don't know, but my guess
is she did wear panties.

22:49.630 --> 22:50.995
And she said Sloan
flashed the judge.

22:51.030 --> 22:53.590
I think you need to stop
reading Paris Hilton's tweets.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.631
Yeah, maybe you should
move her computer

22:55.670 --> 22:56.591
into the living room.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.461
So, what's she like?

22:59.510 --> 23:01.637
She's fine; she's a client.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.545
Yeah, but... is she nice?

23:03.580 --> 23:06.606
I don't know. She asked whether
you guys wanted autographs.

23:06.650 --> 23:07.674
You told her
about us?

23:07.720 --> 23:09.642
No, she just asked
ifI had kids

23:09.680 --> 23:11.045
and whether you'd like
an autograph.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.079
What did you say?

23:12.120 --> 23:13.758
I said I didn't think

23:13.790 --> 23:15.712
you would.
Alicia!

23:15.760 --> 23:17.625
What?

23:17.660 --> 23:20.026
Mom. I want one.

23:20.060 --> 23:21.925
No, that's not what you said.
You said "Alicia."

23:21.960 --> 23:23.860
Yeah, but it was
just for emphasis.
No, no.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.060
No emphasis.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.590
I'm Mom.

23:26.630 --> 23:27.631
So, could I meet her?

23:27.670 --> 23:28.898
(laughs):
No. She's just a client.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.498
Since when did you become
so interested

23:30.540 --> 23:32.929
in Sloan?
I don't know.
She's famous.

23:32.970 --> 23:34.733
ALICIA: Okay, I have
to get to work.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.475
I love you both.

23:36.510 --> 23:37.670
Don't knock over any
liquor stores today, okay?

23:37.710 --> 23:39.598
I love you, too, Alicia.

23:40.650 --> 23:42.618
It was a joke.

23:42.650 --> 23:45.039
(quietly):
It was a joke.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.546
ZACHARY: Nice.
(Grace laughs)

23:46.590 --> 23:49.479
DERRICK: Go ahead.
That's your copy.

23:49.520 --> 23:53.650
I think you'll find
it tough but honest.

23:54.660 --> 23:57.891
Hello, David.

23:57.930 --> 24:00.660
I am in the middle
of a meeting.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.601
What's your square footage here?

24:03.640 --> 24:05.198
I-I don't know.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.539
Can we talk about this
after my meeting?

24:08.580 --> 24:10.639
I'm just trying to see
if it's big enough

24:10.680 --> 24:11.977
for my second secretary.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.676
Allison, can you put
David on the schedule?

24:16.720 --> 24:17.641
It's okay, Allison.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.510
You see, it's this simple.

24:19.550 --> 24:22.713
You peer review even
one more of my people...

24:22.760 --> 24:24.853
I'll take your job.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.149
They're not your people.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.929
(snickers)

24:50.050 --> 24:51.711
We should talk.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.729
We should.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.634
JUDGE CUESTA:
Please call your next witness.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.160
Yes, Your Honor.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.633
Corey Lutz.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.614
Just say it's your mom.
It's not going to matter.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.709
Of course it will matter.
They'll let us in.

25:23.750 --> 25:24.887
She's just a lawyer.
Shh.

25:27.890 --> 25:29.687
CARY:
And aren't you part

25:29.720 --> 25:31.187
of the Sloan entourage,
Miss Lutz?

25:31.230 --> 25:32.925
COREY:
I don't like that word,

25:32.960 --> 25:35.019
but, yes, I think
of her as a friend.

25:35.060 --> 25:38.188
And yet, you were faced
with a moral dilemma
here, weren't you?

25:38.230 --> 25:39.720
There, that's her.

25:39.770 --> 25:41.294
Here hair's longer
than I thought.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.808
COREY:
Yuh-huh.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.866
JUDGE: And "Yuh-huh,"
that would be "yes"?

25:46.910 --> 25:48.878
Yes.
GRACE:
Who's that?

25:48.910 --> 25:51.105
Corey Lutz. She used to
be Sloan's backup singer.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.675
Sloan confessed to me
that she did it.
SHANNON: Where's your mom?

25:53.720 --> 25:56.746
Ijust see a guy.
She wanted to kill Yarissa
so she rammed her car.

25:56.780 --> 25:58.338
I don't know.
Maybe she's out today.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.585
Maybe she's not
a real lawyer.

26:00.620 --> 26:03.282
Maybe she just has
a secret life.
(laughing) Shh.

26:05.090 --> 26:07.593
Oh, Grace, look.
ALICIA:
Good afternoon, Miss Lutz.

26:07.630 --> 26:10.258
Hi.
You know the penalty
for perjury, Miss Lutz,

26:10.300 --> 26:11.858
don't you?
I do.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.765
That's why
I'm telling the truth.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.199
Good.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.607
So let me just ask you
one simple question.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.130
How much do you weigh?

26:22.180 --> 26:24.774
Objection. Relevance.

26:24.810 --> 26:25.799
Your Honor,

26:25.850 --> 26:28.318
the credibility
of the witness

26:28.350 --> 26:29.669
is the only
question here.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.813
Okay, I'd like
to hear the answer.

26:32.850 --> 26:35.853
What was the question?
Your weight.

26:35.890 --> 26:37.778
How much do you weigh?

26:38.830 --> 26:41.697
I weigh 110 pounds.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.820
Are you sure?

26:48.800 --> 26:52.304
Because this copy of
your driver's license says

26:52.340 --> 26:53.932
you weigh 122 pounds.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.971
I've purged since then.

26:56.010 --> 26:58.103
ALICIA:
I see.

26:58.150 --> 27:01.244
Then let me ask you
one more question.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.918
How old are you?

27:03.750 --> 27:05.889
What do you mean?

27:05.920 --> 27:08.286
I mean what's your age?

27:13.800 --> 27:15.358
Twenty-two.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.426
Your driver's license
says you're 28.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.859
I know. It's wrong.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.762
Miss Lutz, you do know
you're under oath.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.163
I do.

27:26.210 --> 27:29.099
Yeah.
And you still swear
you're 22?

27:29.140 --> 27:30.801
I do.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.841
The DMV is all screwed up.

27:34.150 --> 27:35.777
No further questions.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.846
Your mom's bitchin'.

27:41.420 --> 27:45.254
Let me explain why I think
you should endorse me, Pastor.

27:45.290 --> 27:48.293
Your halfway house
on 78th Street,

27:48.330 --> 27:50.924
your food kitchen,
they're struggling.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.369
If I get your
endorsement,

27:52.400 --> 27:55.767
I'll make this my home.

27:55.800 --> 28:00.237
I'll be here in these pews
listening to your concerns.

28:00.270 --> 28:04.343
It's... it's real access.

28:04.380 --> 28:07.042
Now I know you've
been acting

28:07.080 --> 28:09.344
as a spiritual shepherd
to Peter Florrick.

28:09.380 --> 28:10.813
And I respect that.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.818
And I would agree to wait

28:12.850 --> 28:17.981
until after Peter quits the race
to announce any endorsement.

28:18.890 --> 28:21.495
Do you have
any questions?

28:21.530 --> 28:23.964
No.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.490
Thank you for coming by.

28:25.530 --> 28:27.225
No, no, thank you.

28:27.270 --> 28:30.865
Um, I think both of our
mothers worked with Dr. King.

28:41.820 --> 28:44.209
(phone ringing)

28:44.250 --> 28:45.740
Pastor Isaiah? How are you?

28:45.790 --> 28:47.041
I was...

28:47.090 --> 28:48.887
Yes, we still want
your endorsement.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.922
Yes!

28:57.260 --> 28:58.966
You okay?

28:59.000 --> 29:01.889
I'm the tough one.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.135
Milla's sensitive.

29:04.170 --> 29:05.831
We're doing well.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.838
I know.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.074
Thanks.

29:09.110 --> 29:11.977
GRACE:
Mom...

29:13.920 --> 29:15.319
Grace, I...

29:15.350 --> 29:16.476
What are you doing here?

29:16.520 --> 29:18.442
How did
you get here?

29:18.490 --> 29:19.843
Oh, we took the bus.

29:19.890 --> 29:20.857
Shannon lives
right by here.

29:20.890 --> 29:22.414
Grace, you don't just come here.

29:22.460 --> 29:25.327
GRACE: But we finished school.
We came right after.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.021
Shannon really wanted
to meet her.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.288
This isn't how we do things.

29:28.330 --> 29:30.457
You ask me,
and I would bring you.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.320
So, Alicia, this is your kid?

29:33.500 --> 29:35.968
Yes. Grace,
this is Sloan.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.867
Your mom's a
great lawyer.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.366
Thanks.

29:40.410 --> 29:43.277
I really like your music.

29:43.310 --> 29:44.846
Oh, this is Shannon.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.006
Hey.
Hi.

29:46.050 --> 29:47.472
Um, can I ask you something?

29:47.510 --> 29:49.375
Me? Sure.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.388
Do you believe Jesus is Lord?

29:51.420 --> 29:54.184
Okay, thank you, Shannon.
If you could just read

29:54.220 --> 29:55.881
these pamphlets.
You have such an impact on kids.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.217
Grace, take Shannon outside,

29:57.260 --> 29:58.329
and wait for me
out there.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.225
I will be there
to talk to you.

30:00.260 --> 30:01.898
Don't be mad.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.158
I get that a lot.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.862
No, she should have told me.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.026
How old?

30:07.070 --> 30:08.492
My daughter's 14.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.394
She looks older.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.034
So that's what,
high school?

30:13.070 --> 30:15.209
No, middle school.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.846
She seems... nice.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.177
She is.

30:20.210 --> 30:22.019
JUDGE CUESTA:
Everyone front and center now.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.338
What's going on?

30:25.390 --> 30:27.017
WILL: Your Honor, this was just
brought to our attention.

30:27.050 --> 30:28.381
CUESTA: And of course,
that makes it better.

30:28.420 --> 30:30.217
We would urge this court
to revoke bail.

30:30.260 --> 30:32.080
Your Honor,
that would be an overreaction.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.927
To a clear defiance of my
orders? Really, Counselor?

30:33.960 --> 30:36.019
And what would the proper
penalty be for this--

30:36.060 --> 30:37.869
"Corey is such the bitch.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.561
"Went panty-less in court

30:39.600 --> 30:41.864
just to rebel."
WILL:
Your Honor, ifI may...

30:41.900 --> 30:43.902
Mr. Gardner, when I order
something, I want it followed.

30:43.940 --> 30:45.862
SLOAN:
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

30:45.910 --> 30:47.901
It was just for my fans.
It won't happen again.

30:47.940 --> 30:49.134
Well, you're damn
right it won't

30:49.180 --> 30:51.068
happen again because in lockup,
they won't let you tweet.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.975
SLOAN:
No, please...

30:53.010 --> 30:55.217
Young lady, your whole life,
people have allowed you

30:55.250 --> 30:57.241
to make excuses.
Well, that ends today.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.089
Bail has been revoked.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.087
Sheriffs.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.088
No, no...

31:02.120 --> 31:04.020
Mom, Mom, tell them no!

31:04.060 --> 31:06.028
Mom!

31:11.000 --> 31:12.627
Just wanted
to drop by quickly

31:12.670 --> 31:15.138
to respond to your kind
job offer.

31:15.170 --> 31:16.990
Good. Come on in.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.962
How about we make an
announcement together Friday?

31:19.010 --> 31:19.999
How about right now?

31:20.040 --> 31:22.031
What do you mean?

31:22.080 --> 31:23.968
My announcement:
Kiss my ass.

31:24.010 --> 31:25.898
That's it.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.510
Stupid, stupid mistake, Peter.

31:28.550 --> 31:31.189
I don't think so.

31:31.220 --> 31:34.155
I have the Lord in Christ
endorsement.

31:34.190 --> 31:36.055
Why don't you ask
Daley what that means

31:36.090 --> 31:37.318
to the African-American
community.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.384
You're lying.

31:43.060 --> 31:44.095
Where are we in finding

31:44.130 --> 31:46.018
Yarissa's other enemies
at the club?

31:46.070 --> 31:47.321
We need a suspect.

31:47.370 --> 31:48.997
Look, as far
as I can tell,

31:49.040 --> 31:51.531
there were three other Escalades
at the club that night.

31:51.570 --> 31:54.038
Two of them are undamaged
and accounted for,

31:54.080 --> 31:55.331
but the third,
for the moment, isn't.

31:55.380 --> 31:56.938
Interesting.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.005
It was driven
by a Danush Nikad,

31:59.050 --> 32:01.314
a 23-year-old college
dropout from Iranian money.

32:01.350 --> 32:04.285
Please tell me
he went back to Iran.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.538
He went back to Iran.

32:06.590 --> 32:08.057
You want to see a picture?

32:08.090 --> 32:09.512
Will I like it?

32:12.260 --> 32:14.251
How's that for a suspect?

32:17.600 --> 32:20.023
(snickering)

32:20.070 --> 32:22.493
Okay, if I pursue this,

32:22.540 --> 32:24.007
no one's going
to uncover his Escalade?

32:24.040 --> 32:25.507
Point out it was
never in an aCCIdent?

32:25.540 --> 32:27.098
KALINDA: _
I can't promise anything,

32:27.140 --> 32:28.471
but I can't locate it.

32:28.510 --> 32:30.535
Okay. We have to get
this into evidence.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.146
What's up?

32:40.190 --> 32:42.988
They've been
talking a lot.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.226
So?

32:45.530 --> 32:47.998
Something's brewing.

32:48.030 --> 32:50.157
You're being paranoid.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.133
(buzzer sounds)

32:55.170 --> 32:57.138
Can you tell them
I'm not like that?

32:57.170 --> 33:00.628
Tell the judge
it's just an act.

33:00.670 --> 33:03.104
I'm not a bad girl.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.472
I will.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.471
Is my mom here?

33:12.150 --> 33:14.118
I don't know.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.151
I'll go look.

33:19.130 --> 33:21.098
I'm afraid.

33:21.130 --> 33:23.121
(indistinct voice over P.A.)

33:26.670 --> 33:28.661
I know, honey.

33:29.770 --> 33:32.261
I know.

33:36.810 --> 33:40.007
(buzzer sounds)

33:43.650 --> 33:45.618
Are you going in?

33:45.650 --> 33:47.641
Not yet.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.218
KALINDA:
He drove a black Escalade, too.

33:53.260 --> 33:55.125
We think
he went back to Iran.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.422
We can't locate
the car.

33:56.460 --> 33:58.496
WILL: We feel like
if we could just

33:58.530 --> 34:00.259
place him at the club
fighting with Yarissa,

34:00.300 --> 34:01.437
that would turn things around.

34:01.470 --> 34:03.563
We know Milla
was at the club.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.262
We thought she might
have seen him.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.101
Milla, you said something about

34:12.150 --> 34:14.345
another fight,
didn't you?

34:14.380 --> 34:16.371
Did he look
like this guy?

34:21.860 --> 34:24.055
MILLA:
Yeah.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.728
(grunts)

34:27.760 --> 34:29.751
(sighs)

34:31.770 --> 34:33.362
GRACE:
Sorry about today.

34:33.400 --> 34:36.096
I didn't know
she'd do that.

34:36.140 --> 34:38.233
That's okay.

34:38.270 --> 34:40.158
How are you?

34:40.210 --> 34:42.201
Me? I'm good.

34:42.240 --> 34:45.641
You'd tell me if I was
working too much, right?

34:46.710 --> 34:49.440
I'm going to be a lawyer.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.209
Really?

34:51.250 --> 34:53.411
You were great
today in court.

34:53.450 --> 34:55.554
I didn't feel so great.

34:55.590 --> 34:57.683
No, you were great.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.188
Sometimes I don't like
everything I have to do.

35:00.230 --> 35:02.858
What do you have to do?

35:02.900 --> 35:04.367
I don't know, like...

35:04.400 --> 35:07.267
pretend something
is true that isn't.

35:07.300 --> 35:10.337
Yeah, sounds kind
of like school.

35:10.370 --> 35:11.462
(laughs)
(laughs)

35:11.510 --> 35:14.104
Well, that is very comforting.

35:15.680 --> 35:18.376
Like, I'm gonna have to go
to a good law school, right?

35:18.410 --> 35:21.777
Like NYU or Georgetown
or something?

35:21.820 --> 35:23.640
To be a lavwer? Yeah.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.545
And what else?

35:25.590 --> 35:27.842
Like, what should
I study now?

35:29.560 --> 35:32.358
I'll see what books
I can find you.

35:38.330 --> 35:40.491
ALICIA: And then what
did you see, Milla?

35:40.530 --> 35:42.236
MILLA:
Well,

35:42.270 --> 35:45.364
I saw Yarissa Morgan go out
to her car and get in it.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.366
And that's when
you saw the man?

35:47.410 --> 35:49.207
The one you've identified
as Danush Nikad?

35:49.240 --> 35:50.229
Yeah, the bearded guy.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.908
The one I saw
fighting Yarissa.

35:52.950 --> 35:55.248
_ And he went out
into the parking lot, too.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.816
ALICIA:
And then what happened?

35:56.850 --> 35:59.387
Well, I was starting
to go find Sloan

35:59.420 --> 36:02.412
to take her home,
when I heard a crash, so I ran

36:02.460 --> 36:05.588
to the parking lot, and I saw
this black car racing off.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.325
There were, like, these sparks

36:07.360 --> 36:08.896
when it hit a wall.

36:08.930 --> 36:11.421
And why didn't you come
forward with this earlier?

36:11.470 --> 36:13.426
Well, I wanted to,
but my sister worries

36:13.470 --> 36:15.563
about me being
in the spotlight.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.897
ALICIA:
Thank you.

36:16.940 --> 36:19.363
CARY (sighs):
In the Rolling Stone

36:19.410 --> 36:22.402
interview of your
sister, she states:

36:22.440 --> 36:24.408
"Yeah, in high school,

36:24.450 --> 36:27.339
Milla and I were always
covering for each other."

36:27.380 --> 36:29.644
So, Milla, tell me,
is that what's going on here?

36:29.680 --> 36:30.612
You're covering for Sloan?

36:30.650 --> 36:32.584
MILLA:
No.

36:32.620 --> 36:35.282
CARY: Right, because there's a
crazed Iranian driver out there.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.457
WILL:
Objection, Your Honor.

36:36.490 --> 36:38.583
KALINDA:
Milla did it.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.780
She wasn't lying about
being at the club.

36:40.830 --> 36:43.697
Sloan was too drunk to
drive, so Milla drove.

36:43.730 --> 36:46.290
She was the one who
rammed into Yarissa's car.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.332
How do you know?

36:48.370 --> 36:50.235
Because the police
never said anything

36:50.270 --> 36:51.339
about the Escalade sparking

36:51.370 --> 36:53.304
as it scraped the
wall on the way out.

36:53.340 --> 36:55.228
She knew because
she was driving the car.

36:55.280 --> 36:59.376
Sloan's injuries from
that night-- bruises

36:59.410 --> 37:00.707
here and here-- consistent

37:00.750 --> 37:01.978
with being in the
passenger seat,

37:02.020 --> 37:03.749
not the driver's seat.

37:03.780 --> 37:06.544
I also tracked Milla's
cell phone records.

37:06.590 --> 37:09.286
She made two calls at the
time of Sloan's crash.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.480
To her mother.

37:12.290 --> 37:14.258
She crashed the car,
phoned her mother,

37:14.300 --> 37:16.495
and her mother told her
to get out of there.

37:33.910 --> 37:35.946
No.

37:36.980 --> 37:39.312
Are you sure?

37:40.590 --> 37:43.411
You know the person
I mistrust the most?

37:43.460 --> 37:45.451
The one I steal away
from someone else.

37:45.490 --> 37:48.550
IfI betray Peter,
you'll never trust me.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.897
I'll never trust me.

37:49.930 --> 37:52.421
I'm sorry to hear that.

37:52.470 --> 37:53.960
I can offer you
a few names.

38:02.680 --> 38:03.738
Eli!

38:05.410 --> 38:06.547
Who did you get?

38:06.580 --> 38:08.969
Pastor Isaiah.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.511
He endorsed yesterday.

38:11.550 --> 38:12.915
I don't believe you.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.482
Believe.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.090
You blacked out.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.098
You weren't even driving
the car-- Milla was.

38:26.130 --> 38:29.668
She rammed into Yarissa, angry
with her for fighting with you.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.463
Milla then crashed
into a light pole.

38:31.510 --> 38:34.434
She then phoned
your mother.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.607
They decided that
she should get out of there;

38:36.640 --> 38:39.438
let you take the blame
for the false DUI.

38:42.720 --> 38:46.588
So they left me.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.618
What do you want to do?

38:52.660 --> 38:54.628
(sniffs)

38:54.660 --> 38:57.424
How long would she get?

38:57.460 --> 38:59.690
Milla?

38:59.730 --> 39:01.436
Well, unfortunately,
she already testified

39:01.470 --> 39:03.358
that she saw Yarissa
in her BMW.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.503
Two years.

39:04.540 --> 39:06.599
Maybe less.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.473
ALICIA: We'll call the state's
attorney, tell him what we know.

39:09.510 --> 39:10.932
No.

39:10.980 --> 39:12.504
I want to think about it.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.472
Sloan, as your lawyer...

39:14.520 --> 39:17.045
I want to think about it.

39:21.490 --> 39:25.551
She couldn't survive in here.

39:31.530 --> 39:33.623
She'll come around.

39:33.670 --> 39:35.695
To what? What's the right thing?

39:35.740 --> 39:37.560
She didn't do it.

39:38.770 --> 39:40.431
You would let your sister
go to jail?

39:40.470 --> 39:42.802
If she was guilty.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.478
Wouldn't you?

39:46.550 --> 39:48.541
You ever thought
about buying Diane out?

39:53.620 --> 39:56.589
Why would I?

39:56.620 --> 39:58.156
Because she has an
aging client list.

39:58.190 --> 40:00.158
It's just as
healthy as mine.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.589
Yours is diversified.

40:01.630 --> 40:04.827
Is this about David Lee?
Just ignore him.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.497
I'm heading to Washington
for a few weeks,

40:06.530 --> 40:08.839
get a few ducks
in a row, and then...

40:08.870 --> 40:12.533
I'm coming back...
with something big.

40:12.570 --> 40:15.175
Something that will
change this firm.

40:15.210 --> 40:17.178
And I want you on board.

40:17.210 --> 40:18.677
What is it?

40:18.710 --> 40:19.904
A spaceship?

40:23.880 --> 40:26.087
My goal is a legal behemoth.

40:26.120 --> 40:29.886
A Chicago/D.C. alliance that
will overshadow all others.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.480
And I want your help.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.151
Think about it.

40:53.850 --> 40:55.841
Perfection.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.888
Son.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.649
Hey, Dad.

41:03.660 --> 41:05.548
What's up?

41:05.590 --> 41:07.956
Well, the church board is...

41:07.990 --> 41:10.197
unhappy with
your endorsement, son.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.964
Really?

41:14.000 --> 41:17.561
Was this before or after
you talked to them?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.568
They don't understand

41:19.610 --> 41:22.534
why you prefer Florrick
over Wendy Scott-Carr.

41:25.010 --> 41:28.719
She put politics before
religion. He didn't.

41:28.750 --> 41:31.685
They think you're putting

41:31.720 --> 41:34.712
your own personal feelings
before the church.

41:37.020 --> 41:39.727
And what do "they" want?

41:39.760 --> 41:42.991
They want...

41:43.030 --> 41:45.066
me, son.

41:48.770 --> 41:51.159
GUARD:
Make it quick, ladies.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.600
You didn't need to do this.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.699
I know.

41:55.740 --> 41:57.605
I wasn't going to tell.
I know.

41:59.710 --> 42:01.007
Take care of mom.

42:01.050 --> 42:04.076
SLOAN:
It won't be that long.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.109
GUARD:
Miss? You have to go.

42:05.150 --> 42:06.583
Visit me, okay?

42:15.230 --> 42:17.221
(lock buzzes)

42:26.210 --> 42:28.201
(lock buzzes)

42:34.680 --> 42:36.545
Sloan.
