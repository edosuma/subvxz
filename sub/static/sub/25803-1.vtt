00:11.054 --> 00:14.015
[suspenseful drum music]

00:26.236 --> 00:28.278
- [Narrator] On the
edge of an ancient land,

00:28.279 --> 00:31.740
across rolling hills
and rocky cliffs,

00:31.741 --> 00:33.951
along the shores of two seas lay

00:33.952 --> 00:36.537
the principality of Tmutarakan.

00:36.538 --> 00:38.539
It was the time when
the mighty Scythians

00:38.540 --> 00:41.625
succumbed to the
ravages of history.

00:41.626 --> 00:44.211
When the last of their
people disappeared,

00:44.212 --> 00:47.715
along with their ancient
gods and many heroes.

00:47.716 --> 00:51.218
It was the time for new battles
and the glory of heroes,

00:51.219 --> 00:55.055
those brave at heart
and strong in spirit.

00:55.056 --> 00:58.226
And now the time had
come for new legends.

01:04.024 --> 01:06.860
[thunder cracking]

01:09.362 --> 01:12.032
[rhythmic music]

01:16.578 --> 01:19.121
Last year, I drank
some excellent wine

01:19.122 --> 01:20.957
and it was here in this tavern.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.461
The swill that we make
is far from excellent,

01:25.462 --> 01:27.588
but we sure are famous for it.

01:27.589 --> 01:28.714
[both laughing]

01:28.715 --> 01:29.799
So what's your name?

01:30.884 --> 01:32.593
You can call me anything,

01:32.594 --> 01:35.179
as long as you're
a paying customer.

01:35.180 --> 01:36.930
And where's Kudim?

01:36.931 --> 01:37.931
Who?

01:38.725 --> 01:40.684
The owner of this tavern.

01:40.685 --> 01:41.685
He was murdered.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.480
Why is that?

01:44.481 --> 01:48.234
He watered down the wine
and cheated customers,

01:49.277 --> 01:51.653
and then he got
caught fornicating

01:51.654 --> 01:54.783
with a woman who was the
wife of a local merchant.

01:56.993 --> 01:59.203
Are you sure she
wasn't your wife?

01:59.204 --> 02:01.122
[both laughing]

02:03.166 --> 02:04.208
- Watch yourself.

02:04.209 --> 02:09.338
[rhythmic music]

02:09.339 --> 02:12.092
[chicken bocking]

[thunder cracking]

02:22.352 --> 02:24.645
[rhythmic music]

02:24.646 --> 02:27.231
- Let's roast this
duck to take with us?

02:27.232 --> 02:28.232
Hey, master?

02:29.901 --> 02:30.984
[dramatic music]

02:30.985 --> 02:33.238
[grunting]

02:37.742 --> 02:39.994

[grunting]

02:54.050 --> 02:56.261
[grunting]

02:57.720 --> 02:58.720
- No wait!

03:03.434 --> 03:04.434
Your turn.

03:09.149 --> 03:10.567
[knife thudding in wood]

03:13.611 --> 03:16.573
[suspenseful music]

[slicing and gurgling]

05:01.970 --> 05:02.970
- Bring me a sack.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.392

05:08.393 --> 05:09.435

[horses neighing]

06:20.089 --> 06:23.342
[birds squawking]

06:23.343 --> 06:25.344
- Were they the
ones who maimed you?

06:25.345 --> 06:26.345
- No, it wasn't.

06:28.097 --> 06:30.599
Some other Polovtsians
attacked me

06:30.600 --> 06:31.600
on my way to Konchak.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.317
- And I was supposed
to go instead of you.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.320
- Then, Tatiana
would've been mine.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.781
- You think life
with her is sweet?

06:45.782 --> 06:48.034
If only I'd known
how stubborn she was

06:51.204 --> 06:54.456
and I will say you wouldn't
have lasted, not even a week.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.459
[chuckling]

07:02.840 --> 07:05.218
[tense music]

07:55.226 --> 07:56.643
- We're honored to
see you and your son,

07:56.644 --> 07:59.522
Lord Oleg, at the
border to welcome us.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.777
[tense music]

08:12.869 --> 08:16.497
- Lord Vladimir is
offering me to take Chernigov.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.959
I see he's giving his neighbor

08:20.960 --> 08:25.756
what he couldn't manage
himself, but I am not offended.

08:28.009 --> 08:29.009
I will take it.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.475
Was he too busy
to pay me a visit?

08:37.643 --> 08:39.061
[chuckles]

08:39.520 --> 08:41.563
Then you, noblemen,
are my guests.

08:42.315 --> 08:45.775
- Today they're his
guests, tomorrow subjects,

08:45.776 --> 08:47.569
if it's one thing I know,

08:47.570 --> 08:49.613
Oleg wants Kiev for himself.

08:49.614 --> 08:54.577
[suspenseful music]
[birds squawking]

08:55.786 --> 08:58.539
[dramatic metal music]

09:03.419 --> 09:06.505
- [Warrior] Get cover,
we're under attack.

09:06.506 --> 09:09.175
[dramatic music]

09:16.724 --> 09:18.808

09:43.793 --> 09:46.712
[suspenseful music]

10:05.898 --> 10:07.858
[birds calling in distance]

10:19.996 --> 10:21.496
- That's him.

10:21.497 --> 10:22.622
- You should've captured him.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.873
- Yes but he killed himself.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.001
I was too late, Lord.

10:26.586 --> 10:28.086
- But you saved my life.

10:28.087 --> 10:29.129
- It's my duty, my Lord.

10:29.130 --> 10:31.382
- Hey Master, Lutobor!

10:34.885 --> 10:38.138
My master, it's your
wife, she's giving birth!

10:38.139 --> 10:39.682
It's a future warrior!

10:41.267 --> 10:42.643
- Go to her, Lutobor.

10:43.561 --> 10:45.938
[bright music]

11:06.876 --> 11:09.002
- No, no, Master,
you can't go in!

11:09.003 --> 11:10.670
Not yet, you have to wait here!

11:10.671 --> 11:12.547
No sir, you have to wait here.

11:12.548 --> 11:13.757
No please.

11:13.758 --> 11:15.175
- [Prov] Be patient now,
be patient.

11:15.176 --> 11:17.636
Your lady will
deliver very soon.

11:17.637 --> 11:19.721
Every new life begins
with suffering.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.097
- Since when are you so wise?

11:21.098 --> 11:23.058
- [laughs] When my
wife was giving birth

11:23.059 --> 11:25.935
to our sixth child I got
drunk so I would suffer less

11:25.936 --> 11:27.395
and it worked.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.189
Everything will be fine.

11:29.190 --> 11:32.025
[Tatiana screaming]

11:32.026 --> 11:35.236
[baby crying]

11:35.237 --> 11:38.324
[suspenseful music]

11:39.617 --> 11:41.077
- [Lutobor] So, a son?

11:41.494 --> 11:43.495
- Wouldn't you
love your daughter?

11:43.496 --> 11:44.954
- Oh no, I wouldn't.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.040
How dare she be
born before my son?

11:47.041 --> 11:48.458
Give me.

11:48.459 --> 11:51.044
- Look here, you do
have a son, Master.

11:51.045 --> 11:53.589
[baby crying]

12:02.723 --> 12:05.393

[Lutobor laughing]

12:15.820 --> 12:17.946
[bagpipes playing]

12:17.947 --> 12:20.699
- [Gur] Lord Oleg is here!

12:20.700 --> 12:21.450
[trumpet blaring]

12:21.451 --> 12:22.451
He's here!

12:24.745 --> 12:26.496
Lord Oleg's here!

12:26.497 --> 12:27.581
He's arrived.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.752

12:35.631 --> 12:38.467
[bagpipes playing]

12:39.969 --> 12:43.472
[bright rhythmic music]

12:53.816 --> 12:54.858
- So, you have a son now?

12:54.859 --> 12:56.359
- Yes, my Lord.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.778
- Will you name me the godfather

12:58.863 --> 13:01.364
or do you have another choice?

13:01.365 --> 13:02.449
- Are you joking?

13:02.450 --> 13:04.242
I would never have dared to ask.

13:04.243 --> 13:05.744
- Let's see him, let's see him.

13:05.745 --> 13:06.953
- Tatiana!

13:06.954 --> 13:09.373

13:20.718 --> 13:23.471
[peaceful music]

13:37.735 --> 13:39.611
[bright music]
- Oh.

13:39.612 --> 13:40.612
Look at you.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.325
Look at that, he
looks just like you.

13:45.326 --> 13:47.535
[both laughing]

13:47.536 --> 13:50.122
In a year's time, I want
a grandson just like him.

13:51.165 --> 13:53.918
[bright music]

14:00.883 --> 14:03.802
Lutobor, now this sword is yours

14:03.803 --> 14:05.805
until your son is old
enough to hold it.

14:09.475 --> 14:11.059
- [Lutobor] It's an honor, Lord.

14:11.060 --> 14:13.228
- You have earned it, Lutobor.

14:13.229 --> 14:16.022
Show us your swordsmanship.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.733
- This sword is
beyond praise, Lord.

14:19.902 --> 14:22.571

[crowd cheering]

14:48.389 --> 14:51.016
[Kumai laughing]

14:52.268 --> 14:54.519
- Are you any good
in real battle?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.355
- Want to test my
bravery, Polovtsian?

15:01.110 --> 15:02.527
- Are you scared?

15:02.528 --> 15:05.822
- I don't want to contaminate
this soil with all your blood.

15:05.823 --> 15:09.451
- [Lord] No swords.
But instead, you can wrestle.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.084
Don't hurt the
Khan's son too much.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.879
They're my allies nowadays.

15:21.213 --> 15:24.592

[ominous music]

17:25.628 --> 17:26.628
[woman screaming]

17:28.632 --> 17:31.301
- When a blow is threatened,
it's seldom given.

17:32.261 --> 17:32.970
[laughing]

17:32.971 --> 17:34.471
- [Kumai] Open the gate!

17:36.432 --> 17:37.641
- Very good fight.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.185
- [Lord] I know, but there
could be a problem.

17:41.186 --> 17:41.979
Well.

17:41.980 --> 17:43.271
- Yes, my Lord.

17:43.272 --> 17:45.314
- That was very good fighting,
but you may have an enemy.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.315
- No, we'll be fine.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.735
The Polovtsian
was asking for it.

17:48.736 --> 17:49.902
- That may be true.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.320
Well, I'm going.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.990
- Won't you stay for
the celebration, my Lord?

17:53.991 --> 17:56.994
- I'd be happy to, but I have
my princely duties to fulfill.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.081
- Prov!

18:03.000 --> 18:04.125
- [Prov] Safe travel, my Lord.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.126
- Give me.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.882
Feed the musicians
and heat up some water

18:10.883 --> 18:12.885
so I can wash the
Polovtsian snot off.

18:14.470 --> 18:16.220
- To your health, boys.
- Oh yeah.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.263
[crowd cheering]

18:17.264 --> 18:19.265
- What is this?

18:19.266 --> 18:20.808
Look at that, huh?

18:20.809 --> 18:23.353
[ominous music]

18:49.338 --> 18:50.881
- [Tatiana]
Easy there, my warrior.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.133
Save your caresses for later.

18:54.384 --> 18:57.054
[gentle music]

18:58.514 --> 18:59.765
- Is it stitched?

19:02.643 --> 19:03.811
- You're good as new.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.273
I'll seal it with a spell.

[Tatiana] Lutobor!

[baby crying]

20:26.435 --> 20:28.437

- They're over here.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.963
- Come on.
- Come quickly over here.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.590
- This way.
- Get him.

20:57.591 --> 20:59.843
[grunting]

21:05.974 --> 21:08.644
[tense music]
[rain pounding]

21:19.571 --> 21:21.949
[screaming]

21:30.457 --> 21:32.042
- [Prov] The bastard's alive.

21:32.376 --> 21:34.877
I've got him.
- Can anybody help?

21:34.878 --> 21:36.254
- Please over here!

21:36.255 --> 21:37.463
- [Prov] What are we
going to do with him?

21:37.464 --> 21:39.507
- [Warrior] Over here, please!

21:39.508 --> 21:40.425
- [Warrior] What's going on?

21:40.426 --> 21:41.634
- [Warrior] Can anyone hear me?

21:41.635 --> 21:42.677
- Lock him up!

21:42.678 --> 21:44.971
- [Warrior] Somebody help.

21:44.972 --> 21:46.514
- [Warrior] Does anyone
know what happened?

21:46.515 --> 21:47.807
What has just happened?

21:47.808 --> 21:50.227
[rain pounding]

21:54.898 --> 21:58.360
[suspenseful music]

22:16.003 --> 22:18.672
[rhythmic music]

22:37.566 --> 22:40.527
[men laughing]

22:42.237 --> 22:44.281
- Pass them to me.
- Oh yes.

22:46.283 --> 22:48.743
- Over here.
- It's so good.

22:48.744 --> 22:50.536
- Yes.
- Oh.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.539
- That's part of me.
- Pass them down here.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.168
[rhythmic music]

22:57.085 --> 22:59.338
[laughing]

22:59.755 --> 23:02.965
- [Warrior] What? [laughing]

23:02.966 --> 23:05.468
- Lutobor, my friend,
I feel your pain.

23:05.469 --> 23:08.220
We'll find them, I swear
that we'll make them all pay.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.430
- Invite you?
- Quick,

23:09.431 --> 23:11.265
quick pour me some more.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.726
[laughing]

23:13.727 --> 23:16.688
[suspenseful music]

23:18.648 --> 23:21.818
[Warriors chattering]

23:24.529 --> 23:28.324
- [Warrior] Ah, who cares,
pour me another drink.

23:28.325 --> 23:30.159
- [Warrior] Get me out of here.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.286
- Very good, very good.
- Cheers.

23:32.287 --> 23:33.579
[laughing]

23:33.580 --> 23:35.749
[moaning]

23:41.797 --> 23:44.007
- [Lord] I just heard
about what happened.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.302
What are you going to do?

23:51.431 --> 23:52.015
What do they want?

23:52.016 --> 23:53.809
Ransom or something else?

23:55.685 --> 23:58.438
[ominous music]

24:08.490 --> 24:09.615
What do they want?

24:09.616 --> 24:11.368
- [Lutobor] My wife and son...

24:12.661 --> 24:14.413
in exchange for your life.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.040
[sniffs]

24:20.585 --> 24:22.462
- That is a high price.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.799
And what did you choose?

24:27.426 --> 24:28.593
- My duty to you, Lord.

24:31.388 --> 24:32.388
- Thank you.

24:33.682 --> 24:35.267
Hold on to the poison for now.

24:39.688 --> 24:43.400
[bright bagpipe music]

24:46.570 --> 24:50.448
Here's to my
right-hand man Lutobor!

24:50.449 --> 24:51.616
- Cheers.
- Ah.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.076
- [Crowd] Hey!

25:12.679 --> 25:16.098
[gagging]

25:16.099 --> 25:18.643
[ominous music]

25:21.730 --> 25:23.648
- [Lord]
It was him, he poisoned me!

25:25.942 --> 25:29.029
[suspenseful music]

25:31.907 --> 25:32.907
[sniffs]

25:35.118 --> 25:38.622
- Poison, he has the poison!

25:41.166 --> 25:43.418
[grunting]

25:50.550 --> 25:53.303
[peaceful music]

26:35.178 --> 26:36.178
[grunts]

26:37.764 --> 26:40.058
- My husband's going
to track you down!

26:42.018 --> 26:43.728
- We were told not to touch you

26:45.438 --> 26:51.403
but I wouldn't refuse
if you got the desire.

26:52.279 --> 26:54.280
[baby crying]

26:54.281 --> 26:55.361
- [Warrior] Get over there.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.456
[dramatic music]

27:11.756 --> 27:15.760
[singing in foreign language]

28:17.906 --> 28:19.449
- So where is Marten?

28:20.867 --> 28:23.453
- He was killed by Lutobor.

28:25.705 --> 28:28.415
- Truly convenient,
seeing as Marten

28:28.416 --> 28:30.794
was going to challenge
you as the leader.

28:32.504 --> 28:36.840
- I was chosen by Ares as
the strongest of the Wolves.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.967
I will lead the pack!

28:38.968 --> 28:41.262
- Ares will decide that.

28:52.524 --> 28:55.402
[grumbling]

28:56.319 --> 28:59.656
[suspenseful music]

29:05.412 --> 29:10.333
[groaning]
[whip snapping]

29:14.754 --> 29:17.257
[laughing]

29:27.267 --> 29:29.811
[whip snapping]

29:35.567 --> 29:38.152
[metal jingling]
[vocalizing mockingly]

29:38.153 --> 29:39.153
- Huh?

29:40.864 --> 29:42.699
[scoffs]

29:44.993 --> 29:46.703
[door creaking]

29:51.958 --> 29:53.334
- But why, Lord?

29:55.503 --> 29:56.837
I've been faithful to you.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.173
- Yes, I know you've been.

29:59.924 --> 30:01.675
But I want my enemies to think

30:01.676 --> 30:04.387
that you were the one
who poisoned me, Lutobor.

30:06.306 --> 30:10.893
And I recognized the poison,
it's powdered hemlock.

30:10.894 --> 30:13.896
A person who takes it
suffers for seven days

30:13.897 --> 30:15.522
before they end up dying.

30:15.523 --> 30:19.485
So now you have seven days to
get your wife and son back,

30:19.486 --> 30:22.488
and also to find the man
who wanted me to die.

30:22.489 --> 30:23.947
- Thank you, I will do it Lord.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.366
- Don't thank me just yet.

30:27.535 --> 30:28.994
Now you'll escape,

30:28.995 --> 30:33.749
and then I will announce
a reward for your head.

30:33.750 --> 30:38.712
It's the only way,
otherwise the enemies

30:38.713 --> 30:40.924
will not believe that you
poisoned me, will they?

30:48.181 --> 30:50.724
Spare the executioner.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.101
I still need his services.

31:03.863 --> 31:06.990
[suspenseful music]

31:06.991 --> 31:09.035
[grunting]

31:28.221 --> 31:32.600
- Forgive me, my Lord,
for not sparing his life.

31:37.272 --> 31:40.358
[suspenseful music]

32:11.055 --> 32:12.682
[Lutobor]
Prov, Prov!

32:12.849 --> 32:14.309
Prov, come here man.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.102
- Master?

32:17.103 --> 32:17.979
- Be quiet.

32:17.980 --> 32:19.062
Where's the captive?

32:19.063 --> 32:20.063
- He's in the shed.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.816
I think he's a Wolf of Perun,

32:22.817 --> 32:24.985
they're a gang of
hired assassins.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.738
- Bring me my sword
and armor, and clothes,

32:27.739 --> 32:29.407
and water for
washing, and quickly!

32:31.159 --> 32:33.620
[dogs barking]

32:48.092 --> 32:49.092
- No wait.

32:51.554 --> 32:52.972
- Do you want to live, Wolf?

32:54.265 --> 32:57.142
- Yes I do, forgive me for
God's sake, I've done you wrong.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.518
Evil people took me in

32:58.519 --> 33:00.938
and lured me into doing
bad deeds for some gold.

33:00.939 --> 33:01.814
I really only...

33:01.815 --> 33:02.815
- Shut your mouth.

33:03.566 --> 33:06.568
Help me get my family
back and I'll free you.

33:06.569 --> 33:08.445
- I'll help you, I swear
to God, I'll get them.

33:08.446 --> 33:09.988
[sword clinking]

33:09.989 --> 33:11.783
- I know you don't
believe in my God,

33:14.035 --> 33:16.078
but you will take our oath.

33:16.079 --> 33:18.497
You'll swear it at a shrine,

33:18.498 --> 33:21.709
before the idol
of your god. Well?

33:25.296 --> 33:26.296
- I agree.

33:30.510 --> 33:33.262
[dramatic music]

33:38.434 --> 33:40.687
[crashing]

33:42.146 --> 33:45.149
[horses neighing]

33:55.868 --> 33:58.079
[grunting]

34:02.208 --> 34:03.668
- Tell me, where is your master?

34:05.712 --> 34:07.130
- I don't know where he is now.

34:08.755 --> 34:13.260
I haven't seen him since he
left for the Lord's palace.

34:13.261 --> 34:15.972
[suspenseful music]

34:18.933 --> 34:21.185
[groaning]

34:24.688 --> 34:26.607
- [Marten] So where
are you taking me now?

34:28.693 --> 34:30.027
Is this an ancient temple?

34:32.071 --> 34:33.156
A secret shrine?

34:40.746 --> 34:43.416
[fire whooshing]

34:58.598 --> 35:00.974
- Here's your god Perun.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.310
Swear an oath before the idol.

35:03.561 --> 35:06.606
[suspenseful music]

35:09.692 --> 35:13.112
[Marten sighing]

35:18.576 --> 35:20.161
- Perun, god of lightning,

35:21.704 --> 35:24.331
I pledge before you to help

35:24.332 --> 35:27.334
this Lutobor get his
wife and his son back.

35:27.335 --> 35:28.544
- And alive And well.

35:29.504 --> 35:31.296
- And alive and well.

35:31.297 --> 35:34.591
- [Guardian] [Laughing]
But his oath has no value.

35:34.592 --> 35:37.136
He does not pray to the gods.

35:37.845 --> 35:39.972
- [Lutobor] Who are
you, show yourself!

35:41.599 --> 35:44.810
- He prays to a different god.

35:44.811 --> 35:48.271
He is from an ancient tribe
that has lost its greatness.

35:48.272 --> 35:51.316
The last of them make a
living by shedding the blood,

35:51.317 --> 35:54.111
isn't that true, Wolf of Ares?

35:54.112 --> 35:55.570
You are a Wolf.

35:55.571 --> 35:57.907
Tell us, isn't that the truth?

35:58.282 --> 36:00.701
That is true, and at
home I do honor Ares,

36:02.411 --> 36:04.412
but I have respected your god.

36:04.413 --> 36:06.206
- [Lutobor] Tell me who are you?

36:06.207 --> 36:07.887
- [Marten] He's Perun's
Guardian, untie me.

36:09.752 --> 36:13.880
- His people swear
their oaths on a sword

36:13.881 --> 36:17.217
that has been washed
in human blood.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.718
- Why believe you?

36:18.719 --> 36:23.266
- Believe because I am the
keeper of ancient knowledge.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.643
- [Marten] He's blind.

36:26.602 --> 36:28.062
- Oh, but is it you?

36:29.313 --> 36:32.692
You are the one...

36:33.734 --> 36:35.945
who is blind!

36:39.991 --> 36:42.701
[whooshing]

36:42.702 --> 36:45.663
[suspenseful music]

36:47.081 --> 36:48.540
[whooshing]

36:48.541 --> 36:50.625
- [Lutobor] Are you
seeking death, Guardian?

36:50.626 --> 36:53.003
- [Guardian] Oh, but
it is you who found it.

36:53.004 --> 36:57.967
[whooshing]
[swords clinking]

37:00.928 --> 37:03.306
[whooshing]

37:14.650 --> 37:16.234
- [Marten] Kill him!

37:16.235 --> 37:18.528
[grunting]

37:18.529 --> 37:21.908
[swords slashing and clinking]

37:22.909 --> 37:24.493
Calm down, he's dead.

37:25.494 --> 37:26.494
Untie me?

37:28.164 --> 37:30.875
[fire whooshing]

37:37.632 --> 37:42.345
- Your people swear oaths on
a sword washed in blood.

37:44.138 --> 37:45.264
Give your word.

37:46.307 --> 37:49.352
[suspenseful music]

38:02.657 --> 38:03.657
- I give my word.

38:08.537 --> 38:11.290
[peaceful music]

38:14.001 --> 38:18.005
It's good to have your trust,
I won't disappoint you.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.386
[grunting]

38:32.353 --> 38:34.605
[rumbling]

38:48.327 --> 38:49.327
Marten.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.538
- What?

38:51.539 --> 38:52.915
- I said to call me Marten.

38:55.209 --> 38:57.211
- Why didn't you
strangle me, Marten?

38:58.629 --> 39:00.380
- Because I honor Ares

39:00.381 --> 39:02.633
and I wouldn't disgrace
him before the god, Perun.

39:05.011 --> 39:06.387
So I will keep my word.

39:16.897 --> 39:19.442
[ominous music]

39:26.073 --> 39:31.411
- [Servant] I wonder what it's
like to have only one wife.

39:31.412 --> 39:33.121
Don't you get bored?

39:33.122 --> 39:35.332
- One is enough for
God's servants.

39:35.333 --> 39:37.083
Let me baptize you.

39:37.084 --> 39:41.004
- No, a faith that prohibits
concubines just isn't for me.

39:41.005 --> 39:45.216
Also, how can a single
god rule over all?

39:45.217 --> 39:48.470
I mean all the mountains,
and the forests,

39:48.471 --> 39:50.055
and the thunderstorms?

39:50.056 --> 39:53.433
- For you, it's about
women, not thunderstorms.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.560
[laughing]

39:55.561 --> 39:58.271
I don't think that you have
a chance of going to heaven,

39:58.272 --> 39:59.397
mark my word.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.859
[whistling]

40:05.654 --> 40:07.697
[metal clinking]

40:07.698 --> 40:08.698
- [Toryan] Lutobor?

40:10.534 --> 40:14.496
- Maybe I am, but I
don't remember your face.

40:14.497 --> 40:16.873
- My name's Toryan, a merchant.

40:16.874 --> 40:18.625
We met once before.

40:18.626 --> 40:20.252
I heard some stories about you.

40:22.380 --> 40:23.589
- What kind of stories?

40:24.673 --> 40:26.883
- About your
strength and bravery.

40:26.884 --> 40:29.095
- And? Anything else?

40:39.647 --> 40:41.815
- Lord Oleg's searching for you.

40:41.816 --> 40:45.111
There's a big reward, a
nice price for your head.

40:48.030 --> 40:50.366
But I will not hand you over.

40:51.659 --> 40:55.036
Your father said a word for
me before the Lord once,

40:55.037 --> 40:58.416
but I can't be sold
or bought, either.

40:59.333 --> 41:00.668
And not even for gold.

41:01.669 --> 41:04.922
Though, for so much gold, a
father would sell his own son.

41:07.883 --> 41:09.677
- Could Toryan spare two horses?

41:11.220 --> 41:14.598
- I don't have many,
but I will give you two.

41:15.683 --> 41:20.438
So you stay for the night,
have some food, some rest.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.565
I'll give you the
horses tomorrow.

41:23.566 --> 41:26.526
They need to rest well, too.

41:26.527 --> 41:28.695
Tired horses won't
take you too far.

41:28.696 --> 41:31.365
- That's true, the
horses are very tired.

41:33.117 --> 41:35.618
- But don't tell anyone

41:35.619 --> 41:37.455
I didn't hand you
in for the reward.

41:38.664 --> 41:41.374
People will think
Toryan's gone mad

41:41.375 --> 41:43.252
and won't do business
with me any more.

41:44.545 --> 41:48.007
Well, now my dear
guests, enjoy our food.

41:50.593 --> 41:51.593
Come on, eat.

41:57.766 --> 42:00.060

[Tatiana whimpering]
[baby crying]

43:27.606 --> 43:29.275
- [Lutobor]
Savage! You animal!

43:34.780 --> 43:36.031
Why did you kill them?

43:37.324 --> 43:38.659
They just sheltered us.

43:40.828 --> 43:42.079
- The merchant's still alive.

43:44.331 --> 43:47.293
- Lutobor, please spare my life.

43:49.211 --> 43:51.504
- He was going to send
a messenger to the Lord,

43:51.505 --> 43:53.715
and he was going
collect the reward.

43:53.716 --> 43:56.426
- In the name of God,
please don't kill me.

43:56.427 --> 43:58.261
- What's your god's name?

43:58.262 --> 44:00.763
Is it Dajbog, Perun
or maybe Hors?

44:00.764 --> 44:02.808
- I'm begging you in
the name of Jesus.

44:04.101 --> 44:07.979
The devil tempted me
to be a greedy man.

44:07.980 --> 44:09.731
[Marten laughing]

44:09.732 --> 44:12.526
- The devil tempted him,
then they sheltered us.

44:13.444 --> 44:17.448
I think you aren't so good
Lutobor, at judging people.

44:22.870 --> 44:27.540
And so Toryan's honor cannot
be bought or sold, can it?

44:27.541 --> 44:28.916
Yeah?

44:28.917 --> 44:31.252
[grunting]

44:31.253 --> 44:33.713
- Harder, harder.

44:33.714 --> 44:34.715
Harder.

44:36.759 --> 44:39.093
You will be given to the man

44:39.094 --> 44:41.305
who's the one who
paid us to kidnap you.

44:42.598 --> 44:45.475
[suspenseful music]

44:45.476 --> 44:46.684
- Who is he?

44:46.685 --> 44:48.895
- You'll find out when
he comes to get you.

44:48.896 --> 44:51.898
It will be you alone,
without the child

44:51.899 --> 44:54.192
and as for your little son,

44:54.193 --> 44:55.943
he will either be sacrificed

44:55.944 --> 44:59.031
or else trained
to become a Wolf.

45:00.783 --> 45:03.951
Our young boys start
eating off a knife

45:03.952 --> 45:05.204
as soon as they're weaned.

45:06.664 --> 45:08.748
[ominous music]

45:08.749 --> 45:11.084
The training is very tough.

45:11.085 --> 45:13.295
Only one out of
ten becomes a Wolf.

45:17.216 --> 45:19.759
- And starts killing
people for gold?

45:19.760 --> 45:24.723
- Hm, we Wolves do not
kill, but instead we hunt.

45:26.183 --> 45:28.518
For otherwise, my
people would perish.

45:28.519 --> 45:31.479
- Well then I will pray for
my son to avoid such a fate.

45:31.480 --> 45:36.443
- Then pray, but in our
land, your god is powerless.

45:41.615 --> 45:42.949
[birds squawking]

45:42.950 --> 45:44.790
- [Lutobor] You're not human,
you're an animal.

45:46.787 --> 45:48.080
- Yeah, I am an animal.

45:48.914 --> 45:51.250
But when I'm not the
hunter, I'm being hunted.

45:53.627 --> 45:54.836
Now, we're both being hunted.

45:54.837 --> 45:55.629
- What?

45:55.629 --> 45:56.422
[arrow whooshing]

45:56.423 --> 45:57.630
- Go on, go, go now.

45:57.631 --> 45:59.841
- After them.
- After them, go, go.

45:59.842 --> 46:02.468
- Come on.
- Go, go, go.

46:02.469 --> 46:05.722
[arrows whooshing]

46:05.723 --> 46:07.474
- Get them.
- Get them.

46:08.892 --> 46:09.852
- This way.
[arrows whooshing]

46:09.853 --> 46:11.937
- Hurry, hurry.
- Go, go, go.

46:14.982 --> 46:17.900
- Here, over here.
- Go on faster.

46:17.901 --> 46:19.277
- Come on.
- Faster.

46:19.278 --> 46:21.070
- Come on.
- Get him.

46:21.071 --> 46:22.030
[arrows whooshing]

46:22.031 --> 46:23.782

46:36.044 --> 46:37.004
- [Warrior] There, get him.

46:37.005 --> 46:38.588
- Come on.
- He's dead.

46:38.589 --> 46:40.339
Get after him.

46:40.340 --> 46:41.340
- Come on!

46:42.217 --> 46:44.844
[arrow whooshing]
[grunting]

46:44.845 --> 46:46.597
- [Marten] Let's
get down the hill!

46:51.059 --> 46:52.977
Come on, get up, get up.

46:52.978 --> 46:55.773
[ominous music]

47:14.249 --> 47:17.461
[Marten] They'll follow our
tracks and find us.

47:18.670 --> 47:20.230
- [Lutobor] So, we'll
give them a fight.

47:24.468 --> 47:25.803
- This could be suicide.

47:28.514 --> 47:29.514
We're outnumbered.

47:31.099 --> 47:34.519
And they're warriors, not
peasants with pitchforks.

47:34.520 --> 47:37.731
- Warriors or peasants,
I really don't care.

47:41.235 --> 47:43.529
[grunting]

47:44.780 --> 47:46.532
I can't escape with
an injured leg.

47:48.575 --> 47:49.575
Hey Marten?

47:50.994 --> 47:51.994
Marten?

47:55.082 --> 47:56.291
He left me to die.

47:57.793 --> 47:59.544
- [Warrior] Hey over here.

47:59.545 --> 48:02.005
[ominous music]

48:16.395 --> 48:21.984
- One has disappeared, but
we're still on their track.

48:22.818 --> 48:23.943
I need three of
you, come with me!

48:23.944 --> 48:25.821
We'll head him off at the pass.

50:04.294 --> 50:06.212
And we meet again.

50:06.213 --> 50:09.508
Prepare to taste the
blade of my sword.

50:13.053 --> 50:14.220
Your death will be slow.

50:14.221 --> 50:17.598
I'll chop you up and then
feed you to the animals

50:17.599 --> 50:20.184
and when all that's
left is your head,

50:20.185 --> 50:23.146
I will find your wife and
you'll watch me tear her up.

50:25.774 --> 50:29.068
Your bastard will be
my slave and my eunuch.

50:29.069 --> 50:31.570
He'll live with the dogs
and he'll scrub my boots

50:31.571 --> 50:35.033
while I drink wine out of your
scull at the Lord's table.

50:43.208 --> 50:44.418
- Way too many words.

50:46.044 --> 50:47.546
Now shut your trap and fight.

[Lutobor screaming]

52:46.748 --> 52:49.000
Bandage your leg and
drink lots of water.

52:50.043 --> 52:51.752
I'll go and fill the canteen up.

52:51.753 --> 52:53.255
Water will be
scarce from now on.

anything from the living!

[screaming]

54:33.104 --> 54:35.147
Who the hell are they?

54:35.148 --> 54:37.775
- [Marten] They're Forest
People, they worship Veles.

54:37.776 --> 54:40.278
They're giving us to
Berendey, that one.

54:44.366 --> 54:46.408
- [Lutobor] It looks
like no one can beat him.

54:46.409 --> 54:48.035
- [Marten] Why no one?

54:48.036 --> 54:51.957
No a crowd with some spears
or another Berendey could.

54:53.291 --> 54:54.834
- Could both of us beat him?

54:55.877 --> 54:59.880
- Not a chance,
but we could try.

54:59.881 --> 55:01.048
- Uh-huh.

55:01.049 --> 55:02.384

We do not take servants of
their god, god, as sacrifices.

He'll be our slave.

You can transform
into a bear in battle.

01:05:46.819 --> 01:05:49.071
- This gift isn't from
God, but from the Devil.

01:05:50.114 --> 01:05:52.867
I committed a sin that'll
never be forgiven.

01:05:58.956 --> 01:05:59.957
- I hate to tell you,

01:06:01.626 --> 01:06:04.669
but with that gift, you'll
commit many more sins.

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:06.005

[Lutobor screaming]

01:06:17.058 --> 01:06:19.267

01:06:19.268 --> 01:06:20.770
you can't stop or expel him.

01:06:22.104 --> 01:06:24.397
- Oh I can, and I will.

01:06:24.398 --> 01:06:28.694
The bear is only awakened if
the warrior drinks the potion,

01:06:29.612 --> 01:06:31.113
and I will never drink it again.

01:06:33.199 --> 01:06:36.077
- I hear you, but if the
gift is strong in you,

01:06:37.787 --> 01:06:39.914
the bear awakes without
drinking the potion

01:06:41.457 --> 01:06:45.043
and if the gift is powerful
you can tame the beast,

01:06:45.044 --> 01:06:46.837
but your spirit
has to be strong.

01:06:49.215 --> 01:06:54.720

01:06:55.388 --> 01:06:58.432
He won't let me shed
any more innocent blood.

01:07:00.351 --> 01:07:04.771
- Lutobor, that god
of yours is weak.

01:07:04.772 --> 01:07:06.272
Ares is strong

01:07:06.273 --> 01:07:08.858
and he has an appreciation
for bloodshed.

01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:10.235

Now I need to blindfold you.

01:08:50.002 --> 01:08:52.252

get blindfolded

01:08:52.254 --> 01:08:53.671

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.174

get blindfolded,

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:57.885
instead they get
sacrificed to Ares.

Marten was killed?

we honor your greatness
through the seasons, always.

hear my words.

I challenge Yar,
leader of the pack.

01:10:08.539 --> 01:10:10.540
Now make your ruling!

01:10:10.541 --> 01:10:12.667

challenge has been made.

01:10:12.668 --> 01:10:15.253

challenge of this Wolf,

the agreement,

01:10:44.617 --> 01:10:46.452
now release my wife and my son!

01:10:57.963 --> 01:10:59.215
- What agreement is that?

01:11:00.466 --> 01:11:02.425
- The lives of my wife
and son for the Lord's.

01:11:02.426 --> 01:11:03.843
I poisoned him.

01:11:03.844 --> 01:11:04.844

01:11:11.518 --> 01:11:14.229
- We didn't have an
agreement with you.

01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:16.272
The agreement was with the man

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:17.733

01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:19.567

and the poison?

01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:26.532

must be kept a secret,

- You swore an oath.

01:12:20.087 --> 01:12:22.630

worry, I will kill Yar.

I'm stronger than he is,

No one will challenge me,
I'm stronger than them.

01:12:35.227 --> 01:12:36.562
The pack must have a leader.

01:12:38.063 --> 01:12:40.023
Anagast will forgive
me, he will punish me,

01:12:40.024 --> 01:12:41.816
but he will leave me alive

01:12:41.817 --> 01:12:45.320

know he'll forgive too.

01:12:45.321 --> 01:12:46.779

You'll be sacrificed

01:12:55.748 --> 01:12:57.832

be raised by a Wolf.

01:25:52.357 --> 01:25:54.067
if you agree to be loyal to him.

01:25:57.237 --> 01:25:59.738
I just need to know
who the enemy is.

01:25:59.739 --> 01:26:02.534
[Anagast laughing]

01:26:04.369 --> 01:26:05.870

[door creaking]

01:29:22.567 --> 01:29:24.401
- [Lord] Oh, finally!

01:29:24.402 --> 01:29:26.570
I'm so tired of lying
on this deathbed.

01:29:26.571 --> 01:29:30.700
- My Lord, I have
done as you wished.

01:29:33.453 --> 01:29:38.124
- Now let's see just who
wants my death, let's see.

01:29:39.584 --> 01:29:41.501
Did someone make you do this?

01:29:41.502 --> 01:29:43.628
- Luchezar, Kiev's envoy said

01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:46.340
I'd rule under
Kiev's protection.

01:29:46.341 --> 01:29:49.259
Forgive me, Father,
don't kill me!

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.429
- Hm, and how could I?

01:29:58.853 --> 01:30:00.563
You're my only son.

01:30:08.613 --> 01:30:10.531
[sobbing]

01:30:17.955 --> 01:30:18.955
- Lord is dead.

01:30:27.423 --> 01:30:29.801
- [Luchezar] All hail now to
the new Lord of Tmutarakan!

01:30:30.802 --> 01:30:33.804
May he rule wisely under the
guidance of the Lord of Kiev!

01:30:40.269 --> 01:30:43.189

death yet, Luchezar.

01:30:44.649 --> 01:30:46.609
[swords unsheathing and
clanking]

01:30:49.445 --> 01:30:51.406

01:31:35.408 --> 01:31:36.808
- [Lutobor]
You made a wise decision

01:31:39.036 --> 01:31:42.038
in taking the last Scythians
under your protection.

01:31:42.039 --> 01:31:44.249
They'll serve you faithfully.

01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:45.626

what is happening?

01:33:42.994 --> 01:33:44.078
No!

01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:06.726

[rhythmic singing]

01:35:15.336 --> 01:35:16.711
- Tell me why, Lord?

01:35:16.712 --> 01:35:20.507
- In my land there will
be only one people, mine,

01:35:20.508 --> 01:35:22.760
and one power, that's mine.

01:35:37.608 --> 01:35:39.735
- I have been loyal
to you my whole life.

01:35:41.862 --> 01:35:44.990
We had an agreement,
you gave me your word.

01:35:48.953 --> 01:35:52.498
- My subjects do not
make agreements with me.

01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:57.461
They only make pleas
and serve me well.

01:35:58.963 --> 01:36:00.423
So serve me well.

01:36:03.884 --> 01:36:05.302
- I am not your servant.

01:36:09.056 --> 01:36:10.056
- Who are you then?

01:36:12.601 --> 01:36:13.728

Goodbye, Lord.

those bandits for a while

01:36:42.882 --> 01:36:44.717
and now finally it's done.

01:36:48.846 --> 01:36:50.473
- Lutobor killed my son.

01:36:54.018 --> 01:36:56.604
- He has gone to get
his wife and son.

01:37:01.317 --> 01:37:03.569
So he is yours, if you like.

01:37:05.196 --> 01:37:07.573
