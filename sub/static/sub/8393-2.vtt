07:14.950 --> 07:15.905
- YEAH, SO MY MOM SAID
THAT I CAN USE HER CAR

07:16.020 --> 07:17.009
TWICE A WEEK, SO...

07:17.120 --> 07:18.280
- THAT'S AWESOME.

07:18.400 --> 07:18.809
- YEAH, IF YOU WANT,
WE CAN MAKE IT LIKE

07:18.920 --> 07:20.979
A REGULAR THING.

07:21.090 --> 07:24.218
YOU KNOW, THAT WAY
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE BUS.

07:30.930 --> 07:34.229
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

07:34.350 --> 07:36.898
YOU'RE ALL QUIET.

07:38.520 --> 07:42.172
- DREW, WE NEED TO TALK.

07:42.280 --> 07:45.522
I, UM...

07:45.630 --> 07:47.211
I MET A GUY THIS SUMMER.

07:47.320 --> 07:52.565
AT CAMP.

07:52.670 --> 07:56.254
AND IT'S--
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE--

07:56.370 --> 07:58.361
IT'S NOT SERIOUS OR...

07:58.470 --> 08:02.099
- WHAT, ARE YOU, LIKE, BREAKING
UP WITH ME OR SOMETHING?

08:04.650 --> 08:08.404
- PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.795
I REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.652
AND, I MEAN, I STILL WANT
TO BE FRIENDS.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.389
- [scoffs]
- I'M SORRY.

08:16.490 --> 08:17.650
I WANTED TO TELL YOU SOONER,
BUT I JUST--

08:17.770 --> 08:20.455
I COULDN'T, AND THEN--
- YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT

08:20.560 --> 08:21.766
TO WALK IN THE FIRST DAY
OF SENIOR YEAR

08:21.880 --> 08:24.394
WITH ME ATTACHED TO YOU,
I GET IT.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.877
- DREW.

08:26.980 --> 08:30.529
- JUST--OHH.
YOU SHOULD JUST GO.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.608
THE--THE BELL'S GONNA RING.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.189
LIKE, YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE,
SO...

08:41.520 --> 08:45.513
[door shuts]

08:50.390 --> 08:52.312
[school bell rings]

08:54.810 --> 08:57.449
[battle sounds on TV]

08:57.570 --> 09:01.427
[cell phone jingles]

09:01.540 --> 09:04.179
- HEY.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.676
HOW IS HE?

09:05.780 --> 09:07.953
I'LL LET YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF.

09:08.060 --> 09:10.608
HEY...
YOUR MOM WANTS TO TALK TO YOU,

09:10.720 --> 09:13.166
IF YOU'RE UP TO IT.

09:13.270 --> 09:17.206
- HELLO?

09:17.310 --> 09:19.164
- YEAH, MY STOMACH STILL HURTS,

09:19.280 --> 09:23.558
BUT I THINK THE SOUP IS MAKING
IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

09:23.660 --> 09:27.312
YEAH, I THINK
IT WILL BE GOOD TOMORROW.

09:27.420 --> 09:32.323
[rock music]

09:32.430 --> 09:33.397
- THE GRAY?

09:33.500 --> 09:36.560
IT'S NICE, RIGHT?

09:36.670 --> 09:37.705
- IT'S NOT HORRIBLE, BUT...
- NO.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.675
IT'S NOT GOOD.
IT'S NOT GOOD.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.008
NO, I-I--
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:41.130 --> 09:42.848
HOW ABOUT THIS, THOUGH?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS...

09:42.960 --> 09:45.599
OH, YEAH.
IT'S TOO TAN.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.029
NO, I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER.
OOH, DREW'S HERE.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.018
LISTEN, HE'S A NICE KID,
BUT HE'S VERY SHY.

09:50.140 --> 09:51.164
DON'T SCARE HIM.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.134
- WE HAVING A PLAYDATE NOW?

09:53.240 --> 09:54.684
- NO, IT WAS HIS FIRST DAY
OF SENIOR YEAR,

09:54.800 --> 09:55.824
SO YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO ASK HIM A QUESTION.

09:55.940 --> 09:58.693
- NO.
NO, I DON'T.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.688
- HI. HOW WAS IT?

10:00.800 --> 10:01.721
- IT WAS FINE.
- IT WAS OKAY?

10:01.840 --> 10:03.148
YOU DIDN'T CNOSH THE CAR?

10:03.250 --> 10:07.254
- DREW, YOU REMEMBER HANK
FROM THE FAMILY PORTRAIT.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.352
HANK, THIS IS MY SON DREW, WHO
YOU'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK TO.

10:10.470 --> 10:14.634
HUH?

10:16.890 --> 10:20.508
HEY, SO I GAVE DREW THE CAR

10:20.620 --> 10:21.712
SO THAT HE COULD DRIVE
HIS GIRLFRIEND AMY

10:21.820 --> 10:22.502
TO THEIR FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.
HOW WAS IT?

10:22.620 --> 10:24.929
IS SHE IN THE CAR?

10:25.030 --> 10:28.545
- JUST--
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

10:28.660 --> 10:31.174
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
- YES, MOM, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.579
CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT IT
IN HERE FOR SERIOUSLY?

10:34.700 --> 10:36.315
SHE BROKE UP WITH ME.
- OH, MY GOD.

10:36.420 --> 10:37.933
THE FIRST DAY?
- YES.

10:38.050 --> 10:40.006
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE CAR.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.119
SHE BROKE UP WITH HIM,
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

10:46.230 --> 10:46.639
- UH-HUH.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.321
LOVE, MAN.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.398
IT SUCKS.

10:51.510 --> 10:52.818
- HOW COMFORTING.

10:52.920 --> 10:53.432
- [clears throat]

10:53.540 --> 10:57.715
- THANK YOU.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.139
- IT'S INSANITY.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.549
EVERY TIME KRISTINA ADDS
SOMETHING TO THEIR CALENDAR,

11:01.660 --> 11:03.207
HIS PHONE STARTS DINGING.

11:03.310 --> 11:04.174
SO ALL DAY LONG AT WORK

11:04.280 --> 11:05.861
IT'S JUST DING, DING,
DING, DING,

11:05.970 --> 11:08.074
AS SHE ADDS "HAIR APPOINTMENT,"
"MAX," "THIS AND THAT,"

11:08.180 --> 11:10.626
"I'M GONNA BURP,"
WA-WA-WA-WA.

11:10.730 --> 11:12.174
I MEAN, WHOO.
- WELL, WHY DO YOU CARE?

11:12.290 --> 11:14.246
MAYBE IT WORKS FOR THEM.
- WOULDN'T THAT DRIVE YOU CRAZY

11:14.360 --> 11:15.634
IF EVERY TIME I ADDED SOMETHING
TO OUR SCHEDULE

11:15.740 --> 11:17.776
YOUR PHONE STARTED VIBRATING
AND MAKING NOISE?

11:17.880 --> 11:19.279
- OH, WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW,

11:19.400 --> 11:20.298
BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER HAD ONE.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.799
- MM-HMM.
THAT'S RIGHT.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.080
AND WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE ONE.

11:23.190 --> 11:24.532
I'M TELLING YOU,
THE SECOND YOU START PLANNING

11:24.640 --> 11:27.097
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL
OF YOUR LIFE WEEKS IN ADVANCE--

11:27.200 --> 11:28.576
THEY SCHEDULE SEX.

11:28.680 --> 11:29.715
THEY CALL IT "FUNKYTOWN."

11:29.820 --> 11:31.572
- OH, THAT'S CUTE.
- YEAH, THE SECOND

11:31.690 --> 11:33.510
WE START DOING THAT, WE ARE
OFFICIALLY OLD AND MARRIED.

11:33.620 --> 11:34.928
- WELL, WE ARE OLD AND MARRIED.

11:35.030 --> 11:36.964
- WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE OLD
AND MARRIED--I'M NOT.

11:37.070 --> 11:39.482
I'M IN A HOT, STEAMY
RELATIONSHIP THAT SOMETIMES ENDS

11:39.590 --> 11:42.241
ON THE FLOOR OF THIS KITCHEN.
- OOH, NOW THAT IS FUNKYTOWN.

11:42.350 --> 11:44.102
- WHAT'S FOR DINNER?
- WELL, WE'VE GOT

11:44.220 --> 11:47.929
SOME REALLY YUMMY SALMON
AND RICE AND SALAD.

11:48.050 --> 11:49.381
- AWW.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.775
- WHAT?
IT'S GOOD.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.496
IT'S GONNA BE DELICIOUS.
- CAN WE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE?

11:54.610 --> 11:56.180
- HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.700
MAYBE WE JUST FLIP
THIS WHOLE THING ON ITS HEAD,

11:58.820 --> 12:00.469
PUT THIS IN THE FRIDGE
FOR TOMORROW,

12:00.580 --> 12:01.842
AND THEN GO OUT FOR PIZZA.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.336
- YEAH.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:03.440 --> 12:04.850
- NO, NO,
I MADE DINNER.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.166
IT'S READY TO GO.
WE'RE GONNA SIT DOWN AND EAT.

12:06.270 --> 12:08.443
YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT SALMON
THE NEXT DAY.

12:08.550 --> 12:10.063
- I MEAN,
WE COULD BE THOSE PEOPLE

12:10.170 --> 12:11.341
THAT CAN'T BREAK ANY RULES,

12:11.450 --> 12:12.109
OR WE COULD BE THE PEOPLE

12:12.210 --> 12:14.622
THAT EAT THE SALMON TOMORROW,

12:14.730 --> 12:15.583
TONIGHT WE DO PIZZA.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.769
- YEAH.
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?

12:16.870 --> 12:19.338
- PLEASE, MOM, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.212
- FINE, FINE.
- YES.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.218
- ALL RIGHT.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.425
- DO DO DO
- PLEASE.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.155
- WE TALK ABOUT IT

12:32.260 --> 12:34.319
TALK ABOUT IT,
TALK ABOUT IT

12:34.440 --> 12:37.295
WON'T YOU TAKE ME
TO FUNKYTOWN?

12:37.410 --> 12:39.571
WON'T YOU TAKE ME
TO FUNKYTOWN?

12:39.680 --> 12:40.305
- HI.
- HONEY.

12:40.410 --> 12:41.308
- WELCOME HOME.

12:41.410 --> 12:43.162
- I GOT ONE
OF YOUR FAVORITE BOTTLES.

12:43.270 --> 12:45.545
- WOW, THANK YOU.
- FUNKY LADY.

12:45.660 --> 12:47.992
- I MADE YOU
A CORNISH GAME HEN.

12:48.110 --> 12:50.066
- MM, THAT'S
A FUNKY-LOOKING HEN.

12:50.180 --> 12:52.728
- I, UM, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.864
- WHAT? OH.
- WELL, I HAD A--

12:53.980 --> 12:57.040
- WHOOPS.
- A WHOOPSIE TODAY.

12:57.150 --> 12:59.038
- YEAH, YOU HAD A WHOOPSIE?
- I HAD A WHOOPSIE.

12:59.150 --> 13:00.663
- WHAT KIND OF A WHOOPSIE
DID YOU HAVE?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.156
- I MAY HAVE TOLD MAX THAT--

13:02.260 --> 13:03.875
- HEY, DAD, MOM SAID
WE'RE GETTING A DOG.

13:03.990 --> 13:05.366
- WHAT?
- I NEVER SAID THAT.

13:05.470 --> 13:06.744
- AND THIS IS THE ONE I WANT.
- WHEN DID THIS--HONEY.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.226
- COME HERE, LOOK.
- HE'S DOING RESEARCH.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.843
- SHE'S A GOLDEN RETRIEVER.
- GREAT-LOOKING DOG.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.576
- SEE, GOLDEN RETRIEVERS
WERE FIRST BRED IN SCOTLAND.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.888
THEY'RE A MIX BETWEEN
WATER SPANIELS AND LABRADORS.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.160
AND, NOW, THE REASON
THEY'RE CALLED RETRIEVERS

13:17.270 --> 13:19.022
IS BECAUSE MEN
WOULD GO OUT HUNTING.

13:19.140 --> 13:20.368
YOU SEE, THEY WOULD SHOOT
THE BIRDS,

13:20.480 --> 13:21.651
AND SOMETIMES THE BIRDS
WOULD FALL INTO THE POND.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.068
THEY WOULD NEED A COOL DOG

13:23.180 --> 13:25.387
TO BE ABLE TO GO SWIM
AND RETRIEVE THEM, YOU SEE.

13:25.490 --> 13:26.764
- OKAY, LET'S JUST SLOW DOWN
FOR A SECOND, BUDDY.

13:27.870 --> 13:29.724
NOW, MOM,
WE ARE LOOKING AT DOGS.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.068
WE'RE THINKING
ABOUT GETTING A DOG.

13:31.180 --> 13:32.112
WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY
GETTING A DOG.

13:32.220 --> 13:32.834
- WHY WOULDN'T WE?
THEY'RE LOYAL,

13:32.950 --> 13:34.076
AND THEY'RE GENTLE,

13:34.190 --> 13:35.873
AND THEY HAVE
A WHIMSICAL PERSONALITY.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.322
- THEY'RE WHIMSICAL.

13:37.430 --> 13:38.840
- AND THEY'RE
THE PERFECT FAMILY COMPANIONS.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.019
- OH, I KNOW THEY'RE WHIMSICAL.
I UNDERSTAND.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.508
- DAD, THIS LADY
AND HER PARTNER,

13:41.610 --> 13:42.838
THEY'VE GOT ONE LEI-T,
AND THEY LIVE IN SAUSALITO,

13:42.960 --> 13:45.508
AND THEY'RE OPEN FROM 12:00
TO 3:00 TOMORROW.

13:45.610 --> 13:47.020
- A DOG.
- I KNOW.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.337
- IT'S A DOG. YEAH.
- IT'S ONLY 23.6 MILES AWAY

13:49.440 --> 13:50.850
ON THE I-580 WEST.
- MAX, LISTEN TO MOM.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.372
LOOK AT ME. HOLD ON,
BOTH OF YOU, FOR A SECOND.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.369
I NEVER ONCE SAID, EVER--
THANK YOU, BABE.

13:56.490 --> 13:57.684
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- I NEVER ONCE SAID

13:57.800 --> 13:59.313
THAT WE WERE FOR SURE
GETTING A DOG.

13:59.420 --> 14:00.899
- YEAH, YOU SAID THAT YOU AND
DAD TALKED ABOUT GETTING A DOG.

14:01.010 --> 14:01.726
- WE SPOKE--
- THIS IS IT.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.523
THIS IS THE ONE I WANT.

14:03.630 --> 14:05.040
DAD, THIS DOG,
IT'S AMAZING.

14:05.150 --> 14:06.629
WE'RE GETTING
THIS DOG TOMORROW.

14:06.740 --> 14:07.593
- MAX.
- YES!

14:07.700 --> 14:08.735
- OH, MY GOD, MAX.
HONEY.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.979
- YOU KNOW HOW IMPOSSIBLE
THIS IS GONNA BE.

14:11.090 --> 14:12.808
- I NEVER SAID--
- NOW HE THINKS

14:12.920 --> 14:14.012
WE'RE GETTING THIS DOG.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.747
- I SAID THAT WE WOULD
TALK ABOUT IT.

14:15.850 --> 14:17.294
- NOW I'M GONNA HAVE
TO GO EXPLAIN TO HIM

14:17.400 --> 14:19.152
THAT WE MAY NOT EVEN GET A DOG.
HONEY, WE JUST HAD A BABY.

14:19.270 --> 14:21.886
- NO, I JUST HAD A BABY, OKAY?
- APPLE, APPLE.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.093
- I'M THE ONE.
- CAN YOU GIVE HER AN APPLE?

14:24.200 --> 14:25.269
- IT'S NOT AN APPLE.

14:25.380 --> 14:26.404
IT'S A TOMATO.
- I'LL TALK TO HIM.

14:26.520 --> 14:27.168
- I WILL TALK TO HIM.
THIS IS MY FAULT.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.067
I'M SORRY.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.651
WE CAN STILL GO TO FUNKYTOWN.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.001
- OKAY.

14:40.740 --> 14:43.425
- OKAY.

14:43.530 --> 14:44.701
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

14:44.810 --> 14:47.119
[sighs]

14:47.230 --> 14:50.700
99.1.
HE'S NOT GOING.

14:50.820 --> 14:52.048
- THAT'S NOTHING.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.468
- HONEY, WELL,
HE SAYS HE'S SICK.

14:53.580 --> 14:55.468
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
CALL HIM A LIAR?

14:55.580 --> 14:56.740
- SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO,

14:56.860 --> 14:58.168
LET HIM STAY HOME ANOTHER DAY
AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES?

14:58.270 --> 15:00.306
I HAVE MEETINGS
FOR THE REMODEL.

15:00.410 --> 15:01.786
- OKAY, YOU GO.
I'LL STAY.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.401
- SO YOU'RE GONNA MISS WORK?
- YEAH.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.657
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.967
BABE, I HONESTLY THINK
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS

15:07.070 --> 15:08.002
THEY TALKED TO US ABOUT.

15:08.110 --> 15:10.317
WE NEED TO EARN HIS TRUST.

15:10.420 --> 15:11.626
HE NEEDS TO FEEL LOVED
AND SUPPORTED.

15:11.730 --> 15:14.358
IF THAT MEANS MISSING
A FEW DAYS OF SCHOOL,

15:14.460 --> 15:17.566
YOU KNOW, WHO CARES?
IN THE BIG PICTURE?

15:17.670 --> 15:19.558
- OKAY.
BIG PICTURE.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.184
- ALL RIGHT?
- MOMMY.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.609
- HEY.
- I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

15:24.710 --> 15:28.464
I THINK I GOT VICTOR'S BUG.

15:28.580 --> 15:29.842
MY HEAD'S REALLY HURTING.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.882
- SYD, YOU'RE FINE.
WHAT IS TODAY?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.126
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.994
YOU DON'T KNOW?
IT'S TUESDAY.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.273
IT'S ART CLASS.

15:39.380 --> 15:40.199
YOU'RE GONNA
PUT YOUR SMOCK ON,

15:40.310 --> 15:41.481
GET YOUR HANDS
IN THE CLAY.

15:41.590 --> 15:43.899
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER, AREN'T YOU?

15:44.010 --> 15:46.649
LET'S GO.
- WELL, I AM MAKING A VASE.

15:46.770 --> 15:48.795
- YOU ARE?

15:48.910 --> 15:50.946
OH, MY GOSH.
HOW BIG IS THIS VASE?

15:51.050 --> 15:53.803
- DO YOU WANT ANOTHER ONE,
HONEY?

15:53.910 --> 15:54.899
- NO.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.180
RAW ON THE INSIDE AGAIN?

15:56.300 --> 15:59.701

ABOUT YOU.

16:01.510 --> 16:03.956
- WELL, I'M FINE, SO...

16:04.060 --> 16:05.402
- WELL, IT'S TOUGH, YOU KNOW.
WOMEN.

16:05.510 --> 16:07.478
THEY JUST--
THEY RIP YOUR HEART OUT...

16:07.580 --> 16:08.683
- DAD, THIS IS NOT HELPFUL.
- EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS?

16:08.790 --> 16:09.950
- DAD KNOWS.

16:10.070 --> 16:10.889
- STUFF IT BACK IN,
THEN WATCH IT BLEED.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.206
- DAD, DON'T--
THAT'S NOT--

16:12.310 --> 16:13.959
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP
HIS SPIRITS UP.

16:14.070 --> 16:14.923
- RIGHT.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.371
- WOMEN ARE GREAT.

16:16.490 --> 16:17.866
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE JUST SOMETIMES--

16:17.970 --> 16:18.766
- I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
ADVICE ABOUT--

16:18.870 --> 16:20.724
- WHOO, THEY MISS EACH OTHER,

16:20.840 --> 16:22.899
AND IT'S GONNA BE...

16:23.010 --> 16:25.808
YOU KNOW, BETTER SOMEDAY SOON.

16:25.910 --> 16:27.491
- SOMEDAY.
[phone buzzes]

16:27.600 --> 16:29.215
- THAT'S PROBABLY AMY
RIGHT NOW.

16:29.330 --> 16:31.298
"TAKE ME BACK."
- WOW, MOM,

16:31.400 --> 16:33.493
PLEASE STOP WATCHING
EVERYTHING I'M DOING.

16:33.610 --> 16:34.838
IT'S NOT AMY.

16:34.950 --> 16:37.953
IT'S SOME SPAMMER TRYING TO SELL
ME A MALE ENHANCEMENT PILL

16:38.060 --> 16:39.334
FOR A BIGGER PENIS.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.499
- OH, MY.
- THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS.

16:41.620 --> 16:45.477
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS.

16:45.590 --> 16:46.659
- DAD.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.614
- HE COULD BE NAMED CREAM PUFF.
I LIKE THAT.

16:48.730 --> 16:50.516
- OR MARSHMALLOW.

16:50.630 --> 16:51.483
- DAD, WE NEED THIS DOG.

16:51.590 --> 16:52.796
WE'RE GETTING THIS DOG
RIGHT NOW.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.037
- HE'S VERY CUTE,
BUT REMEMBER, MAX,

16:54.150 --> 16:55.242
WE'RE JUST LOOKING.
- THEY'RE SO CUTE.

16:55.350 --> 16:56.624
- WE'RE JUST LOOKING
AT THIS POINT.

16:56.730 --> 16:58.049
- I KNOW, BUT THEY'RE ALL 50--
- HAVE YOU EVER OWNED

16:58.150 --> 16:59.970
A DOG BEFORE, SIR?
- I ACTUALLY HAVE OWNED A DOG.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.490
I DID.
I OWNED A SHIH TZU.

17:01.600 --> 17:05.252
AND IT GOT OUT, BUT--
IT GOT HIT BY A MOVING VAN,

17:05.360 --> 17:08.670
BUT IT WAS NOT MY FAULT.
- HONEY.

17:08.780 --> 17:10.463
- HEY, YOU CAN'T HOUSEBREAK
THOSE DOGS.

17:10.580 --> 17:11.296
- RIGHT.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.435
- I HAD A DOG WHEN I WAS A KID,

17:12.540 --> 17:15.304
BUT NOW WE HAVE A TURTLE,
HAVE A LIZARD.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.025
- WELL, WHAT'S
YOUR LIVING SITUATION?

17:17.130 --> 17:19.166
- EXCUSE ME?
- OUR LIVING SITUATION?

17:19.270 --> 17:20.339
- WELL, IS IT A CONDO?
IT IT AN APARTMENT?

17:20.450 --> 17:21.724
- WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

17:21.830 --> 17:23.513
- IT'S A HOUSE
WITH A BIG YARD,

17:23.620 --> 17:24.370
LOTS OF ROOM TO RUN.
- HAVE A YARD.

17:24.490 --> 17:26.822
- YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW HER.

17:26.940 --> 17:29.079
- SHOW HER WHAT?

17:29.180 --> 17:31.694
- YOU MEAN, YOUR INTENT
ON ACQUIRING ONE

17:31.800 --> 17:34.041
OF THESE CHAMPIONSHIP STOCK

17:34.150 --> 17:35.458
IS TO TURN IT
INTO A HOUSEHOLD PET?

17:35.570 --> 17:39.563
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S A DOG, ISN'T IT?

17:39.670 --> 17:41.979
- NO?

17:42.090 --> 17:43.227
HONEY.
COME ON.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.194
- WHAT?
- [whispers] JUST STOP TALKING.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.359
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT,

17:46.470 --> 17:47.812
LET'S JUST CUT TO THE CHASE.

17:47.920 --> 17:48.887
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT
FOR THE DOG?

17:48.990 --> 17:49.888
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA NEED

17:49.990 --> 17:51.025
SOME TRAINING SESSIONS,

17:51.130 --> 17:52.336
OF COURSE
DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS,

17:52.450 --> 17:54.338
AND A TRAVEL CRATE
FOR THE SHOW DOG.

17:54.450 --> 17:55.894
- NO, NO, NO, WE JUST--
JUST THE DOG.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.069
HOW MUCH YOUHWANT FOR HIM?

17:57.170 --> 17:58.899
- WELL, IT'S A HER.
- OKAY.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.241
- YEAH, SHOULD WE DECIDE
THAT YOUR FAMILY

18:01.350 --> 18:01.862
ARE CAPABLE
OF BEING GOOD DOG OWNERS...

18:01.970 --> 18:04.074
- WE ARE.

18:04.180 --> 18:04.999
- OUR GOLDENS GO FOR $1,200.

18:05.110 --> 18:06.247
- THAT'S RIGHT.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.908
- OH, MAN.
- OKAY. WELL.

18:09.010 --> 18:09.874
- ALL RIGHT, DAD,
LET'S DO IT.

18:09.980 --> 18:11.288
- THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.150
I THINK WE HAVE
TO SLEEP ON IT.

18:12.260 --> 18:13.227
- LET'S DO IT.
- MAX.

18:13.330 --> 18:14.490
- WE CAN AFFORD IT.
WE'RE RICH.

18:14.610 --> 18:16.089
- IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
- WE'RE RICH.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.225
- WE'RE NOT RICH.
- WE'RE RICH.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.809
- WE'RE NOT RICH.
- WE'RE VERY WELL OFF.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.569
- WELL, I CAN DO
A 24-HOUR HOLD

18:20.680 --> 18:21.886
FOR A $200 DEPOSIT.

18:21.990 --> 18:23.093
AND THAT'S CASH OR CHECK.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.088
- MOM, WRITE THE CHECK

18:25.200 --> 18:26.508
- MR. BRAVERMAN, LOOK,
I GOT TO BE HONEST HERE,

18:26.620 --> 18:28.099
THIS PUPPY'S
NOT GONNA LAST LONG.

18:28.210 --> 18:30.849
- WHY, IS IT SICK?

18:30.970 --> 18:32.688
- NO, POPULAR.
- WRITE THE CHECK.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.028
- I'M NOT WRITING A CHECK.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.314
AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A CALL
TOMORROW.

18:38.420 --> 18:40.001
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DOG.

18:40.110 --> 18:41.589
- NO.
- HI.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.497
- I LOVE ETHIOPIAN FOOD.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.636
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO GO THERE.

18:45.740 --> 18:47.321
- YEAH, OKAY, LET ME JUST TALK

OKAY, BYE.
H EY.

18:50.990 --> 18:52.673

ON DINNER FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

18:55.510 --> 18:56.738
WE NEED TO GIVE HER
AN ANSWER.

18:56.850 --> 18:57.919
- KIM?

18:58.030 --> 18:59.236
ARLO'S MOM.

18:59.340 --> 19:00.375

19:00.480 --> 19:01.549
I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE SESSION

19:01.650 --> 19:02.890
JUST STARING AT MY WATCH
THE WHOLE TIME.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.513
YOU KNOW, THE MUSICIANS
CAN KIND OF SENSE THAT.

19:04.620 --> 19:06.133
- COME ON.
IT'LL BE FUN.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.299
- WELL...
- WE NEED COUPLE FRIENDS.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.388
- ARE YOU SURE THAT'S A NEED
AND NOT A WANT?

19:10.490 --> 19:12.105
- YES.
- OKAY, LOOK,

19:12.220 --> 19:13.551
I CAN'T COMMIT
TO FRIDAY.

19:13.660 --> 19:15.901
MAYBE--I WON'T KNOW UNTIL I SEE
HOW THE SESSION'S GOING.

19:16.010 --> 19:18.217
CAN YOU MAYBE CHECK IN WITH THEM
ON FRIDAY AND TELL THEM?

19:18.320 --> 19:20.424
GIVE 'EM LIKE 80%?

19:20.530 --> 19:23.112
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY, THANKS.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.152
OH, HEY,
DO YOU WANT TO HOP IN?

19:25.260 --> 19:26.249
- NO, YOUR SISTER'S COMING

19:26.370 --> 19:27.462
IN, LIKE, 15 MINUTES
TO BRING JABBAR.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.536
- 15 MINUTES?
- YEAH.

19:29.650 --> 19:31.606
- WE CAN MAKE TWINS
IN 15 MINUTES, HONEY.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.676
COME ON.
- THAT DOESN'T TURN ME ON.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.121
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.571
WELL, NICE CHATTING
WITH YOU.

19:36.690 --> 19:38.965
- YOU'RE GETTING WATER
EVERYWHERE.

19:39.070 --> 19:40.446
- I'M GONNA BE IN HERE.
- YEAH.

19:40.550 --> 19:42.552
- I WAS SERIOUS, OKAY?
AND THE IDEA OF AN INTERVIEW

19:42.660 --> 19:43.558
ABOUT A DOG
IS RIDICULOUS.

19:43.660 --> 19:44.558
- IT'S NOT.
- YOU KNOW WHY?

19:44.660 --> 19:47.220
- WHY?
- BECAUSE IT'S A DOG.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.459
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE ADOPTING A BABY.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.619
RIGHT?
AND WE MADE AN AGREEMENT.

19:51.740 --> 19:53.731
WE AGREED THAT WE'D TAKE
OUR TIME WITH THIS.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.946
- YOU TOLD ME WHAT TO DO.
- IT'S THE FIRST DOG WE'VE SEEN.

19:57.050 --> 19:59.564
- HONEY, YOU TOLD ME--
- YES, AND THEN YOU TOLD MAX,

19:59.680 --> 20:02.228
WHICH COMPLETELY UNDERMINES US
MAKING THE DECISION ON OUR OWN.

20:02.330 --> 20:03.467
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
- OKAY. FINE.

20:03.580 --> 20:05.719
YOU KNOW WHAT,
POINT TAKEN.

20:05.820 --> 20:06.980
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
- THANK YOU.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.579
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
I DID.

20:08.690 --> 20:10.408
BUT YOU SABOTAGED THE INTERVIEW
ON PURPOSE.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.829
- I DIDN'T SABOTAGE ANYTHING.
- YOU WENT IN THERE,

20:11.930 --> 20:13.750
AND YOU ACTED LIKE YOU WERE
ON BOARD, AND YOU WEREN'T.

20:13.860 --> 20:15.373
OKAY?
YOU SAID THAT YOU WANTED A DOG--

20:15.490 --> 20:16.275
- I WAS ON BOARD
WHEN WE FIRST GOT THERE.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.347
- YOU WASTED EVERYBODY'S TIME.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.792
- AND THEN THE DOGGY GESTAPO

20:18.900 --> 20:20.242
STARTED ASKING ME QUESTIONS

20:20.350 --> 20:21.556
ABOUT WHAT KIND
OF A DOG OWNER I'D BE.

20:21.660 --> 20:23.036
- YOU BROKE YOUR SON'S HEART.

20:23.150 --> 20:24.003
YOU BROKE
YOUR SON'S HEART.

20:24.110 --> 20:25.213
- I DID?
- YOU KNOW, YOU DID.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.799
HE LOVED THAT DOG.

20:26.910 --> 20:28.354
DID YOU SEE THE WAY IT WAS,
LIKE, SNUGGLING AND NUGGLING?

20:28.460 --> 20:29.188
- COME ON, HONEY,
IT'S $1,200 FOR THAT DOG.

20:29.290 --> 20:31.394
$1,200.
- SO WHAT?

20:31.500 --> 20:32.637
- I KNOW YOU LIKED THAT DOG.

20:32.740 --> 20:34.116
THERE ARE OTHER DOGS
OUT THERE.

20:34.230 --> 20:35.458
- IT'S A LOT OF MONEY,
BUT IT'S WORTH IT.

20:35.570 --> 20:37.049
OKAY?
I'LL DO ANYTHING...

20:37.160 --> 20:38.297
- ALL RIGHT.
- WITHIN REASON

20:38.400 --> 20:39.810
THAT YOU ASK
TO GET THAT DOG.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.740
- YOU WANT THAT DOG, FINE,
WE'LL GET THAT DOG.

20:41.860 --> 20:42.303
- YAY!
- BUT YOU SAID

20:42.410 --> 20:44.503
I'D GET ANYTHING I WANT?

20:44.620 --> 20:46.201
- YOU--ANYTHING.
I MEAN, DO YOU WANT MEATBALLS?

20:46.310 --> 20:48.062
I'LL MAKE YOU PASTA.

20:48.170 --> 20:50.513
FAGIOLI.
- HEY, KRISTINA.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.929
ANYTHING?

20:53.040 --> 20:54.484
- ANYTHING.
- ANYTHING?

20:54.590 --> 20:56.387
- LIKE FUNKYTOWN?
- YEAH.

20:56.490 --> 20:58.867
ANYTHING I WANT.
- OKAY.

20:58.980 --> 21:00.971
EXCEPT--YEAH, I WILL DO
FUNKYTOWN, BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO

21:01.080 --> 21:03.560
THAT ONE THING THAT YOU LIKE
TO DO, 'CAUSE IT HURTS.

21:03.670 --> 21:04.637
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU SAID ANYTHING.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.879
- HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
- IS THAT HADDIE?

21:06.980 --> 21:08.220
- HELLO.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.467
- IT'S THE LADY.
- OH.

21:09.570 --> 21:10.810
- YES, THIS IS KRISTINA.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.467
- TELL HER $900.
- NO.

21:12.580 --> 21:15.504
- HI. YES, OF COURSE.
THANK YOU.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.684
OKAY.

21:19.790 --> 21:24.989
I UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU FOR CALLING.

21:25.110 --> 21:28.762
THEY SOLD THE DOG.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.201
[thud]

21:30.320 --> 21:33.835
- SO...FUNKYTOWN?
- SO...

21:33.940 --> 21:34.804
NO?

21:39.640 --> 21:41.915
- HEY, GUYS, WAKE UP.
WAKE UP.

21:42.020 --> 21:42.327

21:45.440 --> 21:47.431

21:47.540 --> 21:49.508
- I MADE A LIST
OF ALL THE REASONS

21:49.610 --> 21:50.986
WHY WE NEED THAT DOG.
ALL RIGHT?

21:51.100 --> 21:52.374
- HONEY.
- NUMBER ONE:

21:52.480 --> 21:54.539
DOGS, THEY'RE FUN.
THEY JUST ARE.

21:54.650 --> 21:58.609
NUMBER TWO:
DOGS TEACH RESPONSIBILITY.

21:58.730 --> 22:00.277
REASON NUMBER THREE:
THE DOG HAS BEEN SCREENED

22:00.380 --> 22:01.722
AND CERTIFIED.
NOW I DON'T KNOW

22:01.830 --> 22:02.899
WHY THAT'S SO AMAZING.
- THEY SOLD THE DOG.

22:03.010 --> 22:05.649
- THE WEB SITE MADE IT OUT
TO BE GOOD.

22:05.770 --> 22:06.452
- WHAT?

22:06.560 --> 22:09.381
- BABE, THEY SOLD THE DOG.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.489
I TALKED TO THE LADY
LAST NIGHT.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.636
I TALKED TO THE--
LISTEN--LISTEN TO ME.

22:12.740 --> 22:14.879
DON'T GET UPSET.
- NO, YOU GUYS SAID

22:14.980 --> 22:16.186
YOU WOULD SLEEP ON IT,
AND YOU SLEPT ON IT.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.528
- I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN,
HONEY.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.562
- AND NOW I WANT THAT DOG!
- MAX, TAKE IT EASY.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.840
I UNDERSTAND
YOU WANT THE DOG.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.359
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
IN LIFE

22:22.470 --> 22:23.289
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO DEAL WITH, MAX.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.854
HONEY, I GOT
TO TAKE A SHOWER.

22:24.960 --> 22:25.540
- SOMEBODY ELSE
HAD A HOLD ON IT, OKAY?

22:25.650 --> 22:27.436
AND THEY CALLED FIRST.

22:27.550 --> 22:28.824
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- NO. NO.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.204
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- I HAVE TO TAKE A SHOWER.

22:30.310 --> 22:31.516
- THIS IS UNFAIR!
- I CAN'T BELIEVE

22:31.620 --> 22:32.757
YOU'RE LEAVING ME RIGHT NOW.
- EVERYBODY, CHILL--

22:32.860 --> 22:34.179
IT'S ON THE CALENDAR.
YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.895
I KNEW
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.581
- ADAM.
- IT ISN'T FAIR!

22:37.700 --> 22:38.769
- OH, MY GOD.
- DAD, YOU SAID.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.519
- ADAM, ARE YOU KIDDING ME
RIGHT NOW?

22:40.630 --> 22:42.006
PLEASE COME BACK HERE.
WE'RE STILL DISCUSSING THIS.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.078
- I HAVE TO TAKE A SHOWER.
I SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID NO

22:44.190 --> 22:45.521
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
- THERE WILL BE OTHER DOGS.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.039
I PROMISE YOU THAT,
AND I WILL MAKE SURE

22:47.150 --> 22:48.469
THAT YOU GET--
- NO, WE NEED TO GET THAT DOG.

22:48.570 --> 22:49.946
- SWEETIE.
- WE NEED TO GET THAT DOG.

22:50.050 --> 22:51.426
- THE DOG IS TAKEN.
- NO, WE'RE GOING RIGHT NOW...

22:51.540 --> 22:52.529
- CALM DOWN.
ADAM!

22:52.640 --> 22:54.119
- TO TELL THEM
THEY MADE A MISTAKE.

22:54.230 --> 22:55.436
- REALLY?
REALLY?

22:55.540 --> 22:56.746
- WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

22:56.850 --> 22:59.159
MY PARENTS MADE ME GO
TO SWIM TEAM.

22:59.270 --> 23:00.612
OOH, I HATED IT.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.881
I HAD TO GET UP AT 6:00 A.M.
EVERY MORNING.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.820
BUT THEY MADE ME GO,
AND I'M GLAD THAT I DID,

23:04.930 --> 23:07.967
BECAUSE NOW I'M
A REALLY GOOD SWIMMER.

23:08.070 --> 23:10.584
RIGHT, SYD?
- YUP. REMEMBER THAT ONE TIME

23:10.690 --> 23:12.339
YOU CAME TO MY SWIM CLASS
AND YOU ALMOST DROWNDED ME?

23:12.460 --> 23:15.031
- YES, I REMEMBER THAT,

23:15.150 --> 23:16.663
BUT YOU DIDN'T DROWN, 'CAUSE
YOU WERE SUCH A STRONG SWIMMER.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.182
THAT WAS GREAT.
YOU LEARNED.

23:19.290 --> 23:20.427
OKAY, LET'S GO, GUYS.

23:20.530 --> 23:21.736
- LET'S GO.

23:24.610 --> 23:27.295
- COME ON.
AREN'T YOU COMING?

23:27.400 --> 23:28.150
- IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN WALK IN WITH SYDNEY.

23:28.260 --> 23:30.262
- COME ON.

23:30.370 --> 23:32.747
- LET'S GO.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.955
- OKAY.

23:36.060 --> 23:39.063
[car horns honking]

23:39.170 --> 23:41.343
VICTOR, YOU HAVE
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

23:41.450 --> 23:43.372
YOU CAN'T MISS THREE DAYS
IN A ROW.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.479
- MY STOMACH
STILL HURTS.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.457
[car horns honking]

23:50.250 --> 23:52.525
SYDNEY, GO IN.
OKAY, SWEETIE?

23:52.630 --> 23:53.904
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

23:57.050 --> 24:01.009
VICTOR, I KNOW
A NEW SCHOOL CAN BE SCARY.

24:02.640 --> 24:08.294
AND I KNOW THAT IT MIGHT
STILL BE SCARY LIVING WITH US.

24:08.410 --> 24:10.503
BUT I NEED YOU
TO BE BRAVE FOR ME, OKAY?

24:10.620 --> 24:14.966
I NEED YOU TO DO THIS.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.831
HONEY.

24:22.940 --> 24:26.524
OKAY, I WILL STAY
RIGHT HERE.

24:26.630 --> 24:28.871
YOU GO TO SCHOOL,

24:28.980 --> 24:30.629
BUT, IF YOU NEED ME,
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

24:30.740 --> 24:32.560
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.979
- ALL DAY?
- ALL DAY.

24:38.090 --> 24:40.229
- YOU SWEAR?
- DO YOU KNOW PINKY SWEAR?

24:45.620 --> 24:48.259
- UGH, WELL, THAT JUST MAKES ME
HATE HER.

24:48.380 --> 24:49.779
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T HATE HER.

24:49.900 --> 24:50.400
SHE'S A VERY NICE GIRL,
BUT, I MEAN,

24:50.520 --> 24:52.863
I JUST HATE HER.

24:52.970 --> 24:53.789
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

24:53.900 --> 24:55.242
HE JUST SAT ALL BY HIMSELF?

24:55.350 --> 24:58.217
OH, MY GOD, WELL, I GUESS,
WHAT IS SHE SUPPOSED TO DO?

24:58.320 --> 25:01.175
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
WHAT DOES HE HAVE NOW, CALCULUS?

25:01.290 --> 25:02.769
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.666
KEEP AN EYE OUT.
CALL ME IN AN HOUR.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.397
OKAY.
LOVE YOU TOO.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.775
BYE.
OH, MY GOD.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.745
HORRIBLE.
DREW'S HAVING A MISERABLE DAY.

25:10.850 --> 25:12.704
- MM-HMM.
- THANK GOD

25:12.820 --> 25:14.913
MY FIANCE IS THERE, YOU KNOW,
TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR HIM.

25:15.030 --> 25:17.919
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT WEIRD
AT ALL.

25:18.030 --> 25:19.167
- IT'S NOT WEIRD.
WHY IS IT WEIRD?

25:19.270 --> 25:22.068
- IT'S ODD.
- WHY?

25:22.170 --> 25:23.512
- WHATEVER. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.099
- NO, NO, PLEASE,
WHAT'S WEIRD ABOUT IT?

25:25.210 --> 25:26.928
I'D LIKE YOUR OPINION.
CAN YOU JUST TELL ME?

25:27.040 --> 25:29.588
- BOY, OH, BOY.
- LOOK, I WOULD LOVE

25:29.700 --> 25:31.099
A MAN'S OPINION.

25:31.210 --> 25:33.485
- THERE'S A GUY WHO WORKED
FOR ME FOR TWO YEARS.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.101
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.359
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HIS PERSONAL LIFE.

25:37.460 --> 25:39.041
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS MARRIED.

25:39.150 --> 25:40.287
I MISS THAT GUY.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.779
- WELL, I'M NOT THAT GUY.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.632
- BERNIE.

25:45.750 --> 25:46.842
- I'M SORRY
I'M NOT BERNIE,

25:46.950 --> 25:48.394
BUT CAN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
YOUR OPINION?

25:48.510 --> 25:52.025
- YOU WANT TO KNOW MY OPINION?
I THINK YOU'RE BEING AN IDIOT.

25:52.130 --> 25:53.711
- WOW. OKAY.

25:53.820 --> 25:54.684
THAT'S CONSTRUCT IVE.

25:54.790 --> 25:57.611
- NO, YOU ARE.
- OKAY. WHY?

25:57.720 --> 25:59.608
- YOUR SON GOT DUMPED,
AND YOU'RE ALL OVER HIM.

25:59.730 --> 26:01.584
YOU'RE FAWNING OVER HIM.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.100
- I CARE. I'M INTERESTED.

26:03.210 --> 26:04.108
- "OH, IT'LL BE OKAY.
DOODLEPUSS, DON'T WORRY."

26:04.210 --> 26:05.689
- I'M NOT GONNA CALL HIM
DOODLEPUSS.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.006
I'M WORRIED,
AND HE'S IN PAIN.

26:07.110 --> 26:08.486
I'M HIS MOTHER.
- OF COURSE HE'S IN PAIN.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.624
OF COURSE.
WOMEN--

26:09.740 --> 26:12.561
WOMEN ARE CONNIVING
SOUL-CRUSHERS,

26:12.670 --> 26:14.809
AND, IF HE REALIZES THAT,
HE'LL BE OKAY.

26:14.910 --> 26:17.117
HE HAS A CHANCE.
- OH, MY GOD.

26:17.230 --> 26:18.219
SOMEBODY DID NOT
GET INVITED TO PROM.

26:18.330 --> 26:19.979
- I DID GET INVITED
TO PROM.

26:20.090 --> 26:21.432
THAT'S RIGHT.
I WAS PROM KING.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.269
- NO, YOU WEREN'T.
- I WAS PROM KING,

26:23.370 --> 26:24.507
I GOT LAID,
THE WHOLE DEAL.

26:24.610 --> 26:25.713
- WOW.
- ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHY?

26:25.820 --> 26:27.094
'CAUSE I WAS COOL.
I DROVE A HONDA CX500.

26:27.200 --> 26:30.021
I LISTENED TO THE DEAD
INSTEAD OF DISCO.

26:30.140 --> 26:33.166
I SOLD POT OUT OF THE BACK
OF JOEY NICHOLS' CAR,

26:33.280 --> 26:34.304
AND WE MADE A LOT OF MONEY,

26:34.420 --> 26:35.921
AND MY MOTHER NEVER EVEN MET
MY GIRLFRIENDS,

26:36.040 --> 26:39.248
MUCH LESS GAVE ME
DATING ADVICE.

26:39.350 --> 26:40.658
I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT HER.

26:40.770 --> 26:44.592
- SO I SHOULD TELL DREW
TO, WAIT, GET A MOTORCYCLE

26:44.700 --> 26:47.112
AND SELL POT, AND THAT'LL
MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER?

26:47.220 --> 26:49.393
- NO, IT'S SIMPLER THAN THAT.
- WELL, WHAT SHOULD HE DO?

26:49.500 --> 26:50.592
- YOU KNOW WHAT HE SHOULD DO?

26:50.710 --> 26:51.802
HE SHOULD SLEEP
WITH HER BEST FRIEND.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.114
'CAUSE THAT
SHE'LL TAKE NOTICE OF.

26:53.230 --> 26:54.561
- [gasp5]

26:54.680 --> 26:55.817
- 'CAUSE SHE'S GONNA
DO IT TO HIM.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.501
THAT'S JUST THE THING.
SHE'S GONNA DO IT TO HIM.

26:57.610 --> 26:58.508
SO GET THERE FIRST--

26:58.610 --> 27:00.293
AND YOU SEE?

27:00.410 --> 27:02.401
SEE, YOU ASKED MY OPINION,

27:02.510 --> 27:03.613
AND THEN THIS HAPPENS.

27:03.720 --> 27:04.687
AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
WITH BERNIE.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.997
WHY DID YOU ASK ME, THOUGH?

27:07.100 --> 27:09.375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

27:09.480 --> 27:13.587
- I...

27:13.700 --> 27:18.103
AM GONNA GO GET
SOME COFFEE.

27:19.630 --> 27:21.257
[door opens]

27:21.360 --> 27:24.249
[door shuts]

27:38.650 --> 27:41.369
[school bell rings]

27:46.660 --> 27:49.003

28:09.650 --> 28:10.787
- HEY, BEAUTY.

28:10.890 --> 28:11.959
- HEY.
WHERE'S JABBAR?

28:12.060 --> 28:14.096
- I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST GOT HERE.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.088
JABBAR?
- WAIT, YOU DIDN'T GET HIM?

28:16.210 --> 28:18.587
- WHAT, NO,
YOU WERE GONNA GET HIM?

28:18.690 --> 28:20.100
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET HIM.
I TOLD YOU I HAD A CLASS.

28:20.210 --> 28:22.132
- NO, NO, NO,
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.969
- YES, I DID.
YOU SAID YOU HAD IT COVERED.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.695
- OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DID.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.075
I'M SO SORRY.
UM, I SHOULD HAVE--

28:29.190 --> 28:29.622
- WHAT?
PUT IT IN A FREAKIN' CALENDAR?

28:29.740 --> 28:32.254
WHAT A NOTION.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.464
- WHOA, HEY, HEY.
STOP SIGN, STOP SIGN.

28:34.570 --> 28:37.050
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I KNOW YOU
THINK IT'S SO UNCOOL

28:37.160 --> 28:38.741
AND EVERYTHING TO HAVE
A SCHEDULE, BUT, GUESS WHAT?

28:38.850 --> 28:40.260
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO.
THEY ORGANIZE THEIR LIVES

28:40.370 --> 28:42.019
SO CRAP LIKES THIS
DOESN'T HAPPEN!

28:42.130 --> 28:44.269
- THE SCHOOL'S RIGHT HERE.
- I KNOW WHERE HIS SCHOOL IS!

28:44.370 --> 28:46.930
- OKAY, WELL, LISTEN,
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT,

28:47.030 --> 28:48.258
AND HE'S JUST SITTING IN SCHOOL.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

28:48.380 --> 28:50.757
- YOU LEI-T OUR CHILD IN SCHOOL.
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

28:50.860 --> 28:52.088
- I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

28:52.210 --> 28:53.234
- DON'T TELL ME
I'M OVERREACTING.

28:53.350 --> 28:55.033
- YOU'RE BLOWING
THROUGH STOP SIGNS.

28:55.140 --> 28:56.129
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- YOU'RE LOCKING UP THE BRAKES

28:56.250 --> 28:57.274
AS WE PULL INTO OUR SON'S...
- I TRIED.

28:57.390 --> 28:59.415
I TRIED TO BE
ALL "GO WITH THE FLOW"

28:59.530 --> 29:00.622
AND PLAY IT BY EAR

29:00.730 --> 29:01.628
AND NOT BE CONTROLLING,
BECAUSE I KNOW

29:01.740 --> 29:03.002
YOU HAD A PROBLEM
WITH THAT BEFORE.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.314
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I CAN DEAL

29:04.430 --> 29:06.011
WITH YOU BLOWING OFF OUR FRIENDS
FOR DINNER,

29:06.120 --> 29:07.144
BUT I CAN'T DEAL WITH YOU
LEAVING MY CHILD AT SCHOOL.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.522
- IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

29:08.640 --> 29:09.732
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GO TO DINNER

29:09.850 --> 29:11.329
WITH KIM
AND WHATEVER THE GUY'S NAME IS?

29:11.430 --> 29:13.079
- YOU WOULDN'T COMMIT,
SO THEY MADE OTHER PLANS.

29:13.190 --> 29:14.839
- I CAN'T CONTROL WORK, OKAY?

29:14.960 --> 29:16.359
I GAVE YOU
AN 80% COMMITMENT.

29:16.470 --> 29:18.119
- AND YOU'RE 100% ASS.
YOU THINK EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSED

29:18.230 --> 29:19.982
TO WAIT FOR YOU--
- WHAT?

29:22.100 --> 29:23.544
- HI.
- WE ARE SO SORRY.

29:23.650 --> 29:26.892
- WHERE WERE YOU?

29:27.000 --> 29:28.103
- THERE WAS A MIX-UP
WITH HER CALENDAR.

29:28.210 --> 29:31.031
- SORRY, SWEETIE.
- AND THEN...

29:31.140 --> 29:33.381
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN, THOUGH.
- SORRY.

29:33.490 --> 29:34.627
THAN KS.

29:34.730 --> 29:36.072
- SORRY, BUDDY.
WE'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

29:41.020 --> 29:43.944
- ANYWAY, SO THIS--
THIS GIRL--

29:44.050 --> 29:45.938
WELL, LET ME BACK UP,
'CAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

29:46.060 --> 29:48.608
YOU UNDERSTAND HOW AMAZING
THIS GIRL WAS.

29:48.710 --> 29:49.984
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE HOW?

29:50.090 --> 29:50.988
- WELL,
GIRL'S NOT EVEN THE WORD.

29:51.090 --> 29:51.465
WOMAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

29:51.580 --> 29:54.879
- UH-HUH.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.059
- JUST A GORGEOUS RACK,
BEAUTIFUL LEGS.

29:57.170 --> 30:00.344
AND JUST FUNNY.
FUNNY AND SMART.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.918
SMARTER THAN ME.
HELL OF A LOT SMARTER THAN ME,

30:03.040 --> 30:05.031
WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING.
- OH, WOW.

30:05.140 --> 30:07.517
- YEAH.
- SO WHAT HAPPENED,

30:07.630 --> 30:10.599
YOU KNOW,
AI-TER SHE DUMPED YOU?

30:10.700 --> 30:12.008
- I WAS A MESS.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.428
I THOUGHT
MY LIFE WAS OVER.

30:13.530 --> 30:15.839
I STARTED GOING TO THE GALLERY
THAT SHE WORKED AT,

30:15.950 --> 30:17.804
AND I PRETENDED
LIKE I WAS INTERESTED IN ART,

30:17.910 --> 30:19.662
WHICH JUST MADE IT
EVEN WORSE.

30:19.780 --> 30:22.055
AND THEN I WROTE HER A SONG.

30:22.160 --> 30:25.334
- WHEW.
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.407
HOW'D THAT GO OVER?

30:26.510 --> 30:28.262
- THAT WASN'T GOOD.
THAT WAS A DISASTER.

30:28.370 --> 30:31.919
I KNEW TWO CHORDS,
AND BOTH OF THEM WERE MINOR.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.713
- YEAH, THE SAD E-MINOR.
IT ALWAYS WORKS.

30:33.830 --> 30:35.377
- IT WAS SAD.
SEE, YOU KNOW MUSIC, RIGHT?

30:35.480 --> 30:38.449
- KIND OF.
MY DAD WAS A MUSICIAN, BUT...

30:38.560 --> 30:41.939
- WELL, I MADE A TAPE,
AND THEN I LEI-T IT ON HER CAR.

30:42.040 --> 30:46.170

31:55.460 --> 31:57.280
I DIDN'T HEAR BACK

32:22.310 --> 32:23.413
I KNOW I DID,

32:23.520 --> 32:24.760
- OKAY, I KNOW THAT I'M A LITTLE
FREAKED OUT.

32:24.870 --> 32:26.383
I'M SAD, YOU KNOW?

32:26.490 --> 32:30.358
I MISS HADDIE,
AND I'M JUST A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.

32:30.460 --> 32:33.327
I'M ACTING LIKE A BRAT.
I'M SORRY.

32:33.430 --> 32:37.469

WHEN I FELT LIKE,
"JUST GO ALREADY, HADDIE.

32:42.850 --> 32:45.125
GET ON A PLANE."

32:45.230 --> 32:47.050
NOW THE DAY'S COME AND GONE,

32:47.170 --> 32:48.376
AND THERE IS THIS HOLE.

32:51.340 --> 32:53.376
IT'S LIKE THERE'S
A PIECE MISSING.

32:53.480 --> 32:54.924
- YEAH.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.610
WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

32:56.730 --> 32:59.198

33:01.280 --> 33:06.183
WELL, LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW IF WE

33:42.080 --> 33:46.426
LISTEN, I, UM...
I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU

33:46.540 --> 33:49.771
WHAT YOUR CONVERSATION

33:49.880 --> 33:52.394
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK

33:52.510 --> 33:55.365
TO ME ABOUT AMY,
AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND,

33:55.480 --> 33:57.994
BUT, UM, HANK,

33:58.100 --> 33:59.681
NOT YOUR GUY,
I DON'T THINK.

33:59.790 --> 34:01.894
HE SEEMS
LIKE A NICE ENOUGH GUY

34:02.000 --> 34:04.230
AND EVERYTHING,
BUT HE'S A DEEPLY WEIRD,

34:04.350 --> 34:06.409
TROUBLED PERSON WITH VERY
FRIGHTENING VIEWS ON WOMEN.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.203
- OH, MY GOSH.
- AND, I, UH...

34:08.320 --> 34:09.719
I NOTICED YOU GUYS TALKING.

34:09.840 --> 34:14.493
- HE LITERALLY JUST TOLD ME,
LIKE, IT'S OKAY TO BE SAD.

34:14.600 --> 34:15.976
STUFF LIKE THAT.

34:16.080 --> 34:16.978
- THAT'S WHAT HE SAID?

34:17.080 --> 34:21.039
- MM-HMM.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.537
- HMM.

34:23.640 --> 34:24.846

34:29.920 --> 34:30.716
I JUST BOUGHT
SOME RAZOR BLADES.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.788
- DON'T EVEN JOKE ABOUT THAT.

34:32.890 --> 34:34.334
- MOM, PLEASE, COME ON.
- IT'S SO UPSETTING.

34:34.450 --> 34:35.519
- YOU HAVE SLEEPING PILLS,
RIGHT?

34:35.620 --> 34:38.919
- STOP IT!
DON'T EVEN TALK LIKE THAT.

34:39.040 --> 34:39.893
- I'M HAVING TROUBLE SLEEPING.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.865
- NO.

34:41.970 --> 34:42.629

34:42.730 --> 34:44.277

34:52.500 --> 34:53.876
- HEY.

34:53.980 --> 34:56.084
- HI.

34:56.190 --> 34:59.159
I'M, UH, JUST CATCHING UP
ON SOME STUFF.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.262
- AT 3:00
IN THE MORNING?

35:01.370 --> 35:03.099
- WELL, I DIDN'T GO

35:03.200 --> 35:04.849
TO WORK TODAY.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.269
- HUH?

35:07.380 --> 35:09.371
- I WAS DROPPING THE KIDS OFF
AT SCHOOL,

35:09.480 --> 35:14.417
AND VICTOR, YOU KNOW,
HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.455
HE JUST--IT WAS LIKE
HE COULDN'T GET OUT OF THE CAR.

35:17.560 --> 35:18.959
- [sighs]

35:19.080 --> 35:21.002
- OKAY, SO HE DIDN'T GO AGAIN.

35:21.110 --> 35:22.111
- NO, HE DID GO TO SCHOOL.

35:22.220 --> 35:26.350
BUT I TOLD HIM THAT,
IF HE WENT IN,

35:26.460 --> 35:31.045
THAT I WOULD STAY OUTSIDE.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.253
- ALL DAY?

35:33.370 --> 35:34.769
- I KNOW.
IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS.

35:34.890 --> 35:37.984
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.307
THE WHOLE TIME
THAT HE'S BEEN HERE,

35:40.410 --> 35:42.685
HE'S BEEN SO TOUGH.

35:42.790 --> 35:45.065
BUT I LOOKED IN HIS EYES,

35:45.170 --> 35:46.614
AND HE WAS SO SCARED.

35:46.730 --> 35:48.869
AND IT JUST MADE ME REMEMBER
THAT HE'S A LITTLE BOY.

35:48.970 --> 35:52.519
I COULDN'T LEAVE HIM
LIKE THAT, AND I'M SORRY.

35:52.630 --> 35:54.723
I KNOW WE HAVE TO PUT
SOME DISCIPLINE THERE

35:54.840 --> 35:59.664
AND ESTABLISH SOME BOUNDARIES,
BUT I COULDN'T, YOU KNOW.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.673

40:38.120 --> 40:43.126
I LAY SMILIN'
LIKE OUR SLEEPING CHILDREN

40:43.230 --> 40:51.478
ONE OF US WILL DIE
INSIDE THESE ARMS

40:51.580 --> 40:56.472
EYES WIDE OPEN

40:56.590 --> 41:01.550
NAKED AS WE CAME

41:01.660 --> 41:08.008
ONE WILL SPREAD OUR

41:08.120 --> 41:12.352
ASHES ROUND THE YARD
