Hey, kid, it's your dad.

00:49.049 --> 00:49.959
[Alex] Hey, dad, how you doing?

00:55.322 --> 00:57.393
â™ª Happy birthday to you

00:57.458 --> 00:59.301
[Alex] Come on, don't do that.

00:59.326 --> 00:59.963
I know, I'm messing with you.

00:59.994 --> 01:01.667
Happy Birthday.

Good?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.472
[Alex] Yeah, they took
all real well actually.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.142
I'm in this new working
group on cybersecurity.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.344
Oh wow.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.681
That didn't surprise me at all.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.015
[Alex] You know it's
super important stuff.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.022
That's why they got me
working over the holidays.

01:18.012 --> 01:21.550
Listen, dad, thanks for calling
but I gotta get back to it.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.993
My boss is asking for me.

01:23.751 --> 01:24.354
Oh, okay.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.887
Alex, wait.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.901
Before you go, don't
forget I love you, okay?

01:30.057 --> 01:31.400
[Alex] All right,
I love you too...

01:31.425 --> 01:33.063

01:33.093 --> 01:34.401

01:34.428 --> 01:36.499
[Voiceover] Just a moment
ladies and gentlemen.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.010
We're getting reports that
there's been a major attack

01:39.033 --> 01:40.341
on the Pentagon.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.903
The first live satellite images

01:41.936 --> 01:44.041
are just coming
through now and...

01:44.872 --> 01:48.843
Oh my God, the building just
looks practically leveled.

01:48.876 --> 01:52.221
We don't know the number
of casualties just yet,

01:52.246 --> 01:54.453
but first responders
are on the scene

01:54.515 --> 01:55.755
and they're trying
to put out the fire

01:55.783 --> 01:57.956
and find as many
bodies as possible.

01:58.018 --> 02:00.259
(phone ringing)

02:00.287 --> 02:01.527

can see by the live feed,

02:11.699 --> 02:14.737
visibility is a major
issue for rescue crews.

02:15.769 --> 02:16.873
We got disconnected.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.145
Disconnected.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.925
The most significant attack
on American soil since 9/11.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.267
Just one of several attacks
from a terrorist cell...

02:39.293 --> 02:41.068
Communication to an ISIS
official and military official

02:41.095 --> 02:42.005

02:42.062 --> 02:43.439
A question of US retaliation...

02:43.464 --> 02:45.603
The President is meeting
with his Security Council

02:45.633 --> 02:46.668

contracting companies

02:50.504 --> 02:51.676

BlackSun Weapons & Technology

02:56.844 --> 02:59.017

02:59.079 --> 03:00.752

Impressive operation, gentlemen.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.132
Look, Norris, let me be frank.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.800
Better tech, better mechanics
makes for better execution

of our operations which will
help us to bring our sons

07:49.570 --> 07:50.913

08:02.549 --> 08:03.789
I want it end now.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.764
Hunting these bastards
down is a nightmare.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.165
I mean our intel on the
region is getting better

08:09.222 --> 08:12.226
but with signal jammers
blocking satellite imaging,

08:12.259 --> 08:14.068
what the hell am I gonna do?

08:15.262 --> 08:17.139
With more young
lives thrown away.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.810
Nothing worse than wasting the

08:21.835 --> 08:24.076
lives of our next generation.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.777
Prayer services are being

of questions about

08:43.523 --> 08:44.797
the government's relationship

08:44.825 --> 08:45.769
with BlackSun
Weapons & Technology.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.102
Senator Jones, your thoughts.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.869

regulated is the only answer.

Please.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.667
What?

09:19.693 --> 09:20.728
It's just a bra.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.139
Daddy, doesn't wear bras.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.666
No, daddy doesn't
wear bras, okay?

I love you.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.793

have to lake those down.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.463
I know.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.863

15:35.535 --> 15:37.515
I am telling you the truth, okay?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.517
What did your lie
detector tell you?

15:39.539 --> 15:40.779
What did your test tell you?

15:43.109 --> 15:44.110
Please listen to me.

group of insurgents.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.970
That must've sucked, pal.

16:10.904 --> 16:14.477
I know you got a lot going on
upstairs right now, all right?

16:14.541 --> 16:16.748
So I just wanna
show you something

16:16.776 --> 16:19.416
and then ask you a
few questions, okay?

16:19.779 --> 16:20.917
Nice and easy.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.756
Nice and easy, right?

16:25.752 --> 16:29.825

16:39.999 --> 16:41.672
I said turn it off, please.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.303
Okay.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.146
- That's not me.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.775
This is telling
me different, Jack.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.116
I could never do
that to someone.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.280
I could never.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.823
You're looking at seven counts

16:56.850 --> 16:58.659
of premeditated murder, son.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.493
Eight counts.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.525
Another woman just
died in the hospital.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.010
(knocking on door)

17:22.308 --> 17:24.219
You two, a minute, now.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.054
Be right back.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.902
Listen, guys, we all agree
it's a terrible tragedy

17:42.962 --> 17:46.808
what happened this morning
but Homeland Security

17:46.833 --> 17:49.211
and FBI both want
in on this guy.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.646
I'm gonna turn him over.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.411
We'll do what we can for the
victims and their families

17:52.472 --> 17:54.645
and that's it.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.244
Let's wrap it up, okay?

17:56.309 --> 17:57.754
What's wrong with
the world today?

17:57.810 --> 17:59.517
Ton many goddamn agencies.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.320
None of which work together.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.053
Don't break my balls.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.992
Let's just wrap
it, Phil, please?

18:04.017 --> 18:05.758
Come on.

18:24.737 --> 18:25.772
All right.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.183
(gloomy music)

18:31.211 --> 18:32.281
You okay, Jack?

18:32.345 --> 18:33.255
I'm guilty, <i>I</i> did it.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.952
You got me, you caught me.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.334
I'd like to see
my lawyer, please.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.397
Can I get that in writing?

18:43.923 --> 18:44.958
Sure.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.434
Now we know you're guilty.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.968
Why d'you do it?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.640
I got a simple answer
for you, Detective.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.411
John Kennedy once said, â€œThe
cost of freedom is always high

18:59.439 --> 19:00.747
"but Americans have
always paid it."

19:00.773 --> 19:03.947
"And the path that
we'd never take"

19:03.977 --> 19:07.288
â€œis to choose the path of
surrender or submission.â€œ

19:07.313 --> 19:09.418
Now sometimes innocent
people must die

19:09.449 --> 19:11.292
in order for us to
follow that path.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.059
Murder is never acceptable.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.960
Now I want you to look at me.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.408
There's no such thing as
murder in war, soldier.

19:25.431 --> 19:26.774
Jesus Christ!

19:26.799 --> 19:27.937
Get in here!

19:28.801 --> 19:31.975
(dramatic music)

19:47.920 --> 19:50.264
I gotta tell you how many
hours I've been on the phone

19:50.290 --> 19:52.327
getting my ass chewed
off because of this.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.837
Captain, you were there.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.998
Obviously, the guy was suffering

19:55.028 --> 19:57.804
from some severe form of PTSD.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.776
There was nothing
that we could do.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.335
It's all a matter
of perspective.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.846
You two were in
the room with him.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.849
Internal Affairs is already
asking too many questions.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.317
So you both anchor to your desks

20:07.340 --> 20:09.377
until this investigation
is finished.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.442
That's ridiculous, man.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.518
That's all.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.615
Get out.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.397
Phil, give me a minute.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.362
How's our boy doing?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.336
Fine. Why?

20:26.359 --> 20:28.839
I know he's been cleared for
duty but keep an eye on him.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.637
Two eyes.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.844
(thrilling music)

20:50.516 --> 20:52.154
Oh God, I've seen
that look before.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.361
Jack Simon.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.867
You ever seen someone
change like that?

20:56.889 --> 20:58.197
You mean, change a story?

20:58.224 --> 20:59.669
Yeah.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.701
Mitch, you don't have to
think that hard about it.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.106
Obviously, the guy had
some serious issues.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.866
Maybe.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.909
I gotta go-

21:09.936 --> 21:11.779
- You do remember what
behind the desk means, right?

21:11.838 --> 21:14.842
(dramatic music)

21:38.965 --> 21:41.605
I did not kill those people.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.018
No such thing as
murder, soldier.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.944
That was something you did.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.216
You did this.

21:51.244 --> 21:52.917
And sometimes innocent
people must die.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.947
Have you meta
stranger today, right?

21:54.981 --> 21:56.460
Mitch?

21:58.251 --> 22:01.789
(phone vibrating)

22:15.635 --> 22:17.615
Detective Walker.

22:17.637 --> 22:18.980
Listen.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.315
If you want the
truth, Detective,

22:21.741 --> 22:24.585
tomorrow you run
through the park

22:24.610 --> 22:26.851
and I'll he by
the fountain at 7.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.688
And don't be late.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.526
Work?

22:36.622 --> 22:37.692
No.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.364
Wrong number.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.967
(birds chirping)

22:46.999 --> 22:48.307
Hey, babe?

22:51.270 --> 22:52.715
I wanted to remind you,
I have post-ups all week

22:52.772 --> 22:55.116
and a double bypass
this afternoon.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.347
You'll get Katie from school?

22:59.479 --> 23:00.651
Yeah, I can do that.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.988
Don't be late.

23:02.815 --> 23:07.696
(dramatic music)

23:37.817 --> 23:39.660
Sorry about the late night call.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.722
I'm not much of a sleeper.

23:44.590 --> 23:45.762
Haw can I help you, pal?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.701
Professor Peterson, Clarence.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.869
Jack Simon didn't
kill those people.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.773
Okay, thanks.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.513
Good talk.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.850
Listen, I'm sorry, Detective.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.378
Loan'! Tell you more.

24:07.246 --> 24:11.752
I'm putting my life at risk
just even speaking to you.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.897
A risk from who?

24:18.758 --> 24:22.103
Just, listen.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.234
They wanted the senator dead.

24:25.264 --> 24:27.870
All the rest of 'em there was
just fucking collateral damage

24:27.900 --> 24:30.881
to sell the story that
it was a random shooting

24:30.903 --> 24:32.883
and not an assassination.

24:37.243 --> 24:40.452
All the others that got
shot that was bullshit.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.390
Okay, who wanted him dead?

24:42.415 --> 24:44.122
Why?

24:44.150 --> 24:45.629
Complicated.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.930
The shooting was both a
demonstration and a warning.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.742
What's this?

25:00.633 --> 25:02.078
That's all the proof you need.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.508
Proof?

25:04.570 --> 25:05.947
This is not proof.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.508
How were you involved?

25:07.940 --> 25:10.443
Listen, time's up.

25:10.476 --> 25:11.955
You just lack into
it, Detective.

25:11.978 --> 25:14.515
And I promise, all your
questions will be answered.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.989
Detective, don't
come looking for me

25:23.022 --> 25:25.434
or you're gonna be
risking both of our lives.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.862
You just have to trust me.

25:29.962 --> 25:33.034
Just trust me and you'll
uncover the truth.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.870
(perplexed music)

26:16.509 --> 26:17.647
Excuse me.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.416
Excuse me, sir.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.153
Is this absolutely necessary?

26:42.535 --> 26:43.104
(gun fires)

26:43.169 --> 26:46.548
(screaming)

27:12.431 --> 27:13.068
Too precise.

27:13.099 --> 27:17.104
(dramatic music)

27:19.305 --> 27:20.875
So you saw Jack Simon
almost every morning

27:20.906 --> 27:21.907
for about six months?

27:21.941 --> 27:22.783
Yeah.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.810
He seems like a nice guy.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.483
So on the morning
of the incident,

27:28.547 --> 27:29.667
was he acting any different?

27:30.916 --> 27:33.089
Other than blowing up the place?

27:35.121 --> 27:36.600
That's okay. It's okay.

27:36.622 --> 27:37.794
It's okay.

27:37.823 --> 27:38.563
Let me rephrase.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.233
Tell me what happened.

27:43.095 --> 27:48.010
He was going about his
normal daily routine.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.409
He didn't say anything unusual.

27:52.438 --> 27:55.908
And all of a sudden it's
like he switched off,

27:55.941 --> 27:59.184
like nothing going
on behind the eyes,

27:59.245 --> 28:00.918
like a different
person, you know?

28:35.614 --> 28:39.357
Today is May 2nd, 2017.

28:39.785 --> 28:45.394
And it's our first successful
recording of hybrid dream.

28:45.457 --> 28:49.872
(calm music)

29:37.042 --> 29:37.952
Vic!

29:43.916 --> 29:45.054
Victor!

29:50.956 --> 29:51.457
Hey!

29:51.523 --> 29:53.366
Victor!

29:53.392 --> 29:54.097
Come here.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.537
What are you doing?

29:55.561 --> 29:56.130
Get down.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.867
I'm just...

29:59.899 --> 30:01.071
I'm not here to arrest you, son.

30:01.100 --> 30:01.703
Okay-

30:01.734 --> 30:02.474
- Come on.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.639
What are you doing?

30:04.703 --> 30:05.977
Just going for a jog.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.039
Oh, yeah?

30:07.072 --> 30:07.812
I felt tired.

30:07.873 --> 30:08.578
Hmm.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.416
I needed to jog.

30:10.442 --> 30:11.648
Get the blood circulating.

30:12.778 --> 30:13.586
All right, nutbag.

30:13.612 --> 30:14.420
I need your help.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.584
Come on.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.323
Jesus Christ, you got
me all sweaty, Vin.

30:20.452 --> 30:23.296
I don't need to hear
about your personal issues.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.394
If you ever make me
run like that again

30:25.424 --> 30:27.233
I'm gonna shoot you
in the knee cap.

30:31.563 --> 30:33.509
I need to find out
what's on that.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.011
I looked at it but all
the files are encrypted.

30:36.068 --> 30:36.988
Where did you get it?

30:42.308 --> 30:43.412
What the fuck is this?

30:43.442 --> 30:44.011
Nu idea.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.655
This maybe.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.322
(mumbles)

30:54.520 --> 30:55.658
Oh, come on.

30:55.688 --> 30:56.689
You're still playing
poker online'?

30:56.755 --> 30:57.665
YUP-

30:57.690 --> 30:58.691
- You never win.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.031
Still winnin'.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.162
Never winning.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.467
Yup, indeed lam.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.531
And I'm doing very well,
thank you very much.

31:04.596 --> 31:05.506
Yeah, fucking degenerate.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.602
Let me know what you find out.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.671
It's not a degenerate sport.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.341
It's actually very smart.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.646
<i>Fucker.</i>

31:17.609 --> 31:19.111
[Voiceover] It's
another beautiful morning

31:19.144 --> 31:21.385
here on the south land, but
keep those umbrellas close

31:21.447 --> 31:23.984
because we've got a low
pressure system headin' our way

31:24.016 --> 31:27.156
that brings with I!
A 70% chance of rain.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.893
Stay tuned for weather
updates on the hour,

31:28.954 --> 31:32.367
but right now it's time
to get back to the oldies

31:32.391 --> 31:35.634
on 97.3 KBSG.

31:36.962 --> 31:40.171
Senator Jones was shot
three times center mass.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.678
It's precise shooting, Phil.

31:46.805 --> 31:48.375
FBI closed that case.

31:48.741 --> 31:51.688
So even if there is
something bigger goin' on

31:51.710 --> 31:53.986
it's not our case anymore.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.924
Now let's get back to
some real police work,

31:55.981 --> 31:57.358
cases that are still open.

31:57.683 --> 32:00.061
I don't know, man.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.655
I mean the victim
just seemed so random.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.734
The senator was the target.

32:06.759 --> 32:07.533
Come on.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.163
It's just no! Adding up.

32:09.194 --> 32:11.834
Look, the shooting, the lack
of motive, the polygraph.

32:15.868 --> 32:17.939
Feel like taking a ride?

32:20.706 --> 32:22.686
Yeah.

32:24.777 --> 32:26.256
I got that address.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.725
(birds chirping)

32:58.577 --> 33:00.056
(knocking on door)

33:00.079 --> 33:01.956
(dramatic music)

33:12.925 --> 33:15.166
Mr. Peterson?

33:15.227 --> 33:16.604
Professor.

33:17.830 --> 33:21.778
My name is Detective Ross
and you've met my partner.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.748
I'm sorry, but you
don't look familiar.

33:31.443 --> 33:32.615
May we come in?

33:32.644 --> 33:34.004
We need to ask you
a few questions.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.668
So what is this about?

33:50.696 --> 33:52.835
The shooting downtown.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.065
We spoke about it at the park.

33:57.002 --> 34:00.540
I haven't been to
the park in weeks.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.513
I'm good with faces.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.784
I'd certainly
remember if we've met.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.190
When you spoke with my
partner you said you believe

34:09.214 --> 34:10.851
the man who was
responsible was innocent.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.860
I assure both of you
gentlemen I have no idea

34:16.889 --> 34:18.391
what you're talking about.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.652
And if you don't mind I'm
late for an appointment.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.231
It's okay.

34:26.498 --> 34:27.875
We'll see ourselves out.

34:31.003 --> 34:32.914
Real quick.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.331
Do you mind if I
use your bathroom?

34:38.976 --> 34:40.422
Last roam on the right.

34:40.478 --> 34:41.480
Thank you.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.199
Yeah, sorry about all of this.

34:53.391 --> 34:55.167
We gotta be thorough
when we investigate

34:55.194 --> 34:56.696
something like this.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.456
It's a real tragedy what
happened to those people.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.842
(thrilling music)

36:31.823 --> 36:35.100
(toilet flushing)

36:40.999 --> 36:43.673
You know, I've been
studying your research.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.012
What a powerful stuff.

36:46.038 --> 36:49.850
A little above my pay grade but

36:49.875 --> 36:50.979
you wouldn't happen to
know where I could find.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.129
Dr. Chris Downey, would you?

36:56.448 --> 36:57.654
Sure.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.185
Mission Cemetery.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.833
Chris died eight months ago.

37:08.293 --> 37:10.796
Well, if you change your mind.

37:11.830 --> 37:14.902
Like I said, Detective,
we never met before today.

37:16.301 --> 37:17.405
Gut it.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.704
Satisfied?

37:49.735 --> 37:51.237
This ain't right.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.749
That guy was not in the wheelchair
two days ago, all right?

37:53.772 --> 37:55.183
He was walking around
like you and me.

37:55.207 --> 37:57.585
The guy called me over,
looked me right in the eye

37:57.609 --> 38:00.249
standing up, told
me this whole story

38:00.278 --> 38:01.916
about all this bullshit.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.517
I hate to tell you this, Mitch.

38:03.548 --> 38:04.925
Bu! He's been in that
wheelchair for four years.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.021
It's in his file.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.622
You think I'm losing
my fucking mind'?

38:08.687 --> 38:10.462
The captain told you
to slay behind the desk.

38:10.522 --> 38:11.466
Phil.

38:11.523 --> 38:12.627
Let it go.

38:20.265 --> 38:22.802
(car engine starts)

38:27.606 --> 38:28.983
Good morning.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.144
Thank you for calling
BlackSun Weapons & Technology.

38:30.208 --> 38:31.278
Can I help you?

38:31.309 --> 38:32.481
I'm sorry.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.024
Mr. Norris is not
available right now.

38:34.880 --> 38:35.984
Yup, bye.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.254
Good morning, Alice.

38:38.283 --> 38:40.229
Oh, Mr. Norris, Clarence
Peterson unsuccessfully

38:40.252 --> 38:41.993
tried to access our
server this morning.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.832
The professor
forgot his password?

38:46.825 --> 38:47.997
Well, was he having
some problems?

38:48.059 --> 38:50.403
Let's see if we can
help him out, okay?

38:50.429 --> 38:51.169
Yes, sir.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.976
(phone ringing)

39:02.974 --> 39:04.681
Yeah, I was just
gonna report in.

39:04.743 --> 39:07.349
There were just two detectives
here asking questions.

39:07.412 --> 39:08.152
Really?

39:08.180 --> 39:10.421
What did you tell them?

39:10.449 --> 39:11.951
I told nothing.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.589
Someone tried to access
your server, Professor.

39:14.619 --> 39:15.962
Did you know that?

39:15.987 --> 39:17.989
Hey, look, don't Worry about it.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.833
I'll handle it like I always do.

39:32.637 --> 39:36.380
(thunderstorm)

40:22.053 --> 40:23.327
Be careful, honey.

40:23.355 --> 40:24.231
You don't wanna spill
it on your clothes.

40:24.256 --> 40:26.167
Mom would know we had ice cream.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.339
(car crashing) (explosion)

40:33.532 --> 40:35.239
(thrilling music)

40:35.267 --> 40:36.268
Katie?

40:36.334 --> 40:37.278
Katie!

40:40.071 --> 40:40.879
(gun fires)

40:40.906 --> 40:41.509
Stay dawn, honey.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.110
Stay down!

40:43.174 --> 40:46.178
(dramatic music)

41:49.007 --> 41:50.077
What the hell happened, Mitch?

41:50.108 --> 41:55.148
(soft music)

41:55.180 --> 41:57.490
There was a guy.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.152
He had a gun.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.093
I don't know.

42:00.285 --> 42:01.093
And everything happened so fast.

42:01.119 --> 42:03.190
You don't know?

42:03.254 --> 42:04.790
What do you mean you don't know?

42:06.691 --> 42:08.693
What the hell could
be so important

42:08.760 --> 42:10.137
that you weren't paying
attention to the road?

42:10.161 --> 42:12.471
No, I was paying
attention to the road.

42:12.497 --> 42:13.339
It just...

42:17.535 --> 42:18.639
Okay-

42:20.772 --> 42:21.978
You know what?

42:22.007 --> 42:22.678
I can't Do this right now.

42:22.707 --> 42:24.482
You should go.

42:24.509 --> 42:25.351
Angela.

42:26.378 --> 42:27.482
Angela.

42:48.633 --> 42:52.080
(thrilling music)

42:52.137 --> 42:55.710
Mr. Peterson, it's not too
late to tell us what you know.

42:56.975 --> 42:58.682
You hear that asshole?

42:58.710 --> 43:00.189
Fuck your mother.

43:00.211 --> 43:01.918
Did you know there was
a little girl in that oar

43:01.980 --> 43:03.857
and now she's in intensive care?

43:03.882 --> 43:05.884
We know you're involved somehow.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.726
But guess what, asshole?

43:09.921 --> 43:11.764
Due to lack of evidence
we have to let you go.

43:11.823 --> 43:14.326
Today's your lucky day.

43:16.194 --> 43:17.605
Mitch.

43:17.662 --> 43:20.575
You think I don't know you're
having trouble right now?

43:20.598 --> 43:22.771
But I told you to
leave Peterson alone.

43:22.834 --> 43:25.405
You had no probable
cause to arrest him.

43:25.437 --> 43:28.350
I'm asking for five
minutes with him, Captain.

43:28.373 --> 43:30.546
I know he's involved somehow.

43:30.575 --> 43:32.748
No, we are releasing him
because we have no reason

43:32.777 --> 43:33.949
to hold him.

43:34.012 --> 43:35.787
And I am not gonna
bend the rules for you.

43:36.848 --> 43:38.452
Now, I gave you a warning

43:38.516 --> 43:39.756
and things are
beyond fucked up now.

43:39.784 --> 43:42.856
You left me no options here.

43:42.887 --> 43:44.560
I gotta suspend you.

43:44.589 --> 43:45.966
This is bullshit, Captain.

43:46.024 --> 43:49.096
You fucking bang my desk like
again I'll fucking kill you!

43:49.127 --> 43:51.630
Who the fuck do you think
you are, hotdog, huh?

43:53.098 --> 43:54.771
It's a paid leave.

43:54.799 --> 43:55.436
Go home.

43:55.467 --> 43:56.605
Enjoy your wife.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.113
It's a holiday.

43:59.237 --> 44:00.773
Don't make me take this
to another level, okay?

44:00.805 --> 44:03.217
Oh, come on.

44:03.241 --> 44:04.481
Don't go there.

44:07.779 --> 44:08.985
Yes, sir.

44:13.952 --> 44:15.295
Hey.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.390
Hey!

44:18.089 --> 44:19.568
What?

44:19.591 --> 44:20.934
What the hell were you
thinking arresting Peterson?

44:20.959 --> 44:22.632
I mean, what good would this
be doing Angela and Katie

44:22.660 --> 44:24.162
if you're fired?

44:24.229 --> 44:26.072
Do you think I give a shit
about this job right now?

44:26.097 --> 44:27.576
Here's what I know.

44:27.599 --> 44:30.307
We go see Clarence,
someone tries to kill me.

44:32.003 --> 44:34.244
Come on, you're not
thinking rationally.

44:34.272 --> 44:35.012
You don't know, Phil.

44:35.073 --> 44:36.950
You weren't there.

44:44.482 --> 44:45.756
San of a bitch.

44:52.690 --> 44:53.668
Yo!

44:53.691 --> 44:55.295
Nat a good time, Vic.

44:58.463 --> 45:00.465
It's nanotechnology.

45:00.498 --> 45:02.136
And it's fucking
out of this world,

45:02.167 --> 45:04.647
crazy fucking technology.

45:04.669 --> 45:06.512
What does that mean?

45:06.538 --> 45:07.881
I have no fucking idea.

45:07.939 --> 45:08.644
What?

45:08.673 --> 45:10.152
I have no idea.

45:10.175 --> 45:11.711
I don't even think that
people who designed it

45:11.776 --> 45:13.050
know what it actually does.

45:13.111 --> 45:14.556
And what about the drive?

45:14.612 --> 45:16.285
Technology this
advanced can only be used

45:16.314 --> 45:17.452
for military uses.

45:17.482 --> 45:18.825
Okay, that means
nothing to me, Vic,

45:18.850 --> 45:20.488
if I don't know what it does.

45:20.518 --> 45:22.623
Look, I managed tn
download some of the code

45:22.654 --> 45:23.792
from this tech.

45:23.822 --> 45:26.996
I had to slop because
it started to call home.

45:28.693 --> 45:29.535
Home?

45:29.561 --> 45:30.062
What do you mean?

45:30.128 --> 45:30.970
What's home?

45:30.995 --> 45:32.668
I didn't wail to find out.

45:32.697 --> 45:34.199
Look, I don't want
anything to do with this.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.678
Hey, you're the only
person I can (rust,

45:36.701 --> 45:38.681
the only person with
the skills to do this.

45:38.703 --> 45:39.647
You owe me.

45:39.671 --> 45:40.206
I don't owe you shit.

45:40.238 --> 45:41.478
[Bullshit]

45:41.506 --> 45:43.042
No, I already paid you back.

45:43.074 --> 45:44.246
I already paid you back.

45:44.309 --> 45:46.915
And if I didn't,
you'd be in a B by 10.

45:46.978 --> 45:48.924
I need your help.

45:48.980 --> 45:50.891
Please.

45:54.853 --> 45:56.855
I don't know.

45:58.523 --> 46:00.662
All right, but neither
of us are gonna like

46:00.692 --> 46:01.727
what I find on this.

46:23.548 --> 46:24.959
Somebody's been talkin'.

46:27.051 --> 46:29.190
I swear to God.

46:29.220 --> 46:30.858
I swear to God, I
haven't said a word.

46:35.193 --> 46:38.402
Listen, you promised to get
me out of this fucking chair

46:38.429 --> 46:39.703
if I helped you.

46:39.731 --> 46:41.233
Now I got the cops at my door.

46:42.634 --> 46:43.203
I want out.

46:48.473 --> 46:49.918
You want out?

46:56.748 --> 46:58.056
Okay, you're out.

46:58.082 --> 47:00.995
(dramatic music)

47:02.987 --> 47:05.661
Take Mr. Peterson home.

47:06.925 --> 47:08.962
Yes, sir.

47:19.771 --> 47:20.647
(knocks on window)

47:20.672 --> 47:20.979
Yes, sir?

47:21.005 --> 47:22.313
One more thing.

47:22.340 --> 47:23.842
I wanna avoid any
potential leaks.

47:23.908 --> 47:26.479
Find out what this
detective knows, okay?

47:26.511 --> 47:27.990
Use the wife.

47:28.012 --> 47:28.752
You sure?

47:28.780 --> 47:29.485
Yeah.

47:29.514 --> 47:30.788
Do it.

47:31.916 --> 47:33.623
All right.

47:39.257 --> 47:39.962
I'm so sorry.

48:05.350 --> 48:09.799
(kettle whistling)

48:09.821 --> 48:14.531
(gloomy music)

48:52.764 --> 48:54.835
There's still time
to tell me the truth.

48:57.268 --> 48:57.837
The truth.

48:57.869 --> 48:59.871
Yeah.

48:59.904 --> 49:02.680
Whose truth, Kyle?

49:02.707 --> 49:03.947
You like that tea?

49:05.576 --> 49:07.715
Oh fuck!

49:12.950 --> 49:14.793
You've been feeding
that cop breadcrumbs.

49:17.789 --> 49:19.234
You want out?

49:19.257 --> 49:20.537
You wanna get out of that chair?

49:21.759 --> 49:24.205
Now you're out.

49:24.228 --> 49:25.188
You got what you wanted.

49:30.068 --> 49:31.274
Snitch!

49:33.871 --> 49:38.786
(thrilling music)

50:07.305 --> 50:08.909
Bullshit algorithms.

50:30.128 --> 50:34.167
(phone ringing)

50:34.198 --> 50:35.643
Yeah?

50:35.666 --> 50:37.839
We have a non-authorized
attempt to access the sewer.

50:37.869 --> 50:39.473
Where did it originate?

50:39.504 --> 50:40.778
We're attempting to
pinpoint that now, sir.

50:40.805 --> 50:42.785
If that drive falls
into the wrong hands.

50:42.807 --> 50:44.343
Yes, sir.

50:44.375 --> 50:44.853
Find out.

50:44.876 --> 50:45.718
Go!

50:54.819 --> 50:57.732
[Voiceover] Identity verified.

50:57.788 --> 50:59.893
Welcome, Mr. Norris.

51:02.860 --> 51:04.533
Hello.

51:04.562 --> 51:05.973
Hey.

51:05.997 --> 51:07.806
How you doin', man?

51:07.832 --> 51:10.870
Just calling to
check in with you.

51:10.902 --> 51:11.812
You all right?

51:11.836 --> 51:13.372
How you think I'm doin', Phil?

51:13.838 --> 51:16.580
That son of a bitch put my
baby girl in the hospital

51:16.641 --> 51:17.415
and I need answers.

51:17.475 --> 51:18.647
Don't even think about it.

51:18.676 --> 51:20.417
I'm going to talk to Peterson.

51:20.478 --> 51:21.821
Just stay put, Mitch.

51:21.846 --> 51:22.984
Sorry.

51:23.014 --> 51:24.493
I know what I need to do.

51:24.515 --> 51:25.357
(car engine starts)

51:25.383 --> 51:26.259
Just stay right...

51:26.918 --> 51:29.398
(engine running)

51:30.721 --> 51:31.756
Shill

51:32.823 --> 51:37.203
(ominous music)

51:46.571 --> 51:47.879
(knocking on door)

51:49.106 --> 51:50.710
Peterson.

51:50.741 --> 51:52.379
I just need to ask
you a few questions.

51:53.277 --> 51:55.518
(knocking on door)

51:55.546 --> 51:56.957
Mr. Peterson.

51:57.949 --> 52:00.395
I'm not here to arrest you.

52:06.023 --> 52:08.196
Peterson, I'm not here
to arrest you, man.

52:08.226 --> 52:09.068
I'm just...

52:33.884 --> 52:34.624
Mitch, I know you're here.

52:34.652 --> 52:35.995
I saw your car outside.

52:39.924 --> 52:41.961
Phil.

52:41.993 --> 52:42.903
Come on, man.

52:42.927 --> 52:44.338
You don't think I killed him.

52:44.395 --> 52:46.341
He was like this when I came in.

52:46.397 --> 52:48.468
(thrilling music)

52:48.499 --> 52:50.339
Mitch, I don't know
what's goin' on with you.

52:52.136 --> 52:55.140
But I'll give you one hour
then I gotta call this in.

52:57.408 --> 52:58.614
Thanks, Phil.

53:04.649 --> 53:07.755
(car engine roaring)

53:12.456 --> 53:13.434
Shill.

54:22.426 --> 54:23.905
Welcome home, honey.

54:31.702 --> 54:33.582
I thought you'd be at
the hospital with Katie.

54:36.674 --> 54:37.846
I missed you.

54:38.709 --> 54:39.789
I came home to be with you.

54:45.049 --> 54:46.960
What's the matter, baby?

54:47.017 --> 54:48.963
Don't you want me?

54:49.019 --> 54:50.794
Angela, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

54:50.855 --> 54:51.959
Something happened.

54:52.022 --> 54:54.559
You could not come
back to this house.

54:54.592 --> 54:55.627
I need you to go
back to the hospital

54:55.693 --> 54:58.139
with a security and
wait for my call.

54:58.195 --> 54:58.935
Okay.

54:58.963 --> 54:59.873
- Do you understand?

54:59.897 --> 55:00.637
Calm down.

55:00.698 --> 55:02.302
Angela, listen to me.

55:02.366 --> 55:03.436
I'm not fucking with you.

55:04.468 --> 55:05.105
- Baby.
- What are you doing?

55:05.136 --> 55:07.207
Relax, baby.

55:09.206 --> 55:10.583
You don't want me?

55:12.576 --> 55:13.714
What the fuck?

55:14.745 --> 55:17.885
(dramatic music)

55:17.915 --> 55:18.791
What the fuck are you doing?

55:18.816 --> 55:20.762
I thought you liked it rough.

55:20.785 --> 55:23.664
(scuffling)

55:30.294 --> 55:31.398
What are you doing?

55:43.073 --> 55:44.279
What are you doing?

55:54.819 --> 55:56.457
(glass breaking)

56:02.159 --> 56:02.762
He's out and
ready for transport.

56:02.793 --> 56:03.669
Good work.

56:03.694 --> 56:05.970
Sir?

56:05.996 --> 56:07.436
He might have
suspected I wasn't her.

56:14.505 --> 56:16.542
(explosion)

56:16.607 --> 56:18.780
You're coming to
my recital, right'?

56:18.809 --> 56:20.288
Of course I am, baby.

56:25.483 --> 56:26.553
Katie!

56:31.956 --> 56:33.833
You're coming to
my recital, right'?

56:33.858 --> 56:36.065
Of course I am, baby.

56:36.126 --> 56:37.486
I wouldn't miss
that for the world.

56:39.563 --> 56:42.806
(Spray noise)

56:48.239 --> 56:49.684
Good morning sunshine.

56:52.643 --> 56:54.680
What d'you do with my
wife, you son of a bitch?

56:54.712 --> 56:56.157
Maybe something, maybe nothing.

56:59.817 --> 57:00.761
Look familiar?

57:04.488 --> 57:05.398
No.

57:06.724 --> 57:07.600
No.

57:07.658 --> 57:10.366
Oh, come on, Detective.

57:10.394 --> 57:13.398
Do you think you'd be
here if I didn't know

57:13.430 --> 57:16.172
that you know what this is?

57:18.435 --> 57:20.608
Okay, look, let me
ask you a question.

57:20.671 --> 57:24.619
You wake up one day and all
of a sudden you have the power

57:24.675 --> 57:29.624
to cure all diseases, stop
hunger, eliminate all racism

57:30.014 --> 57:31.584
and end wars.

57:31.615 --> 57:35.586
Bu! The price for this is
you have to kill a child,

57:35.619 --> 57:40.591
just one, a small
innocent child.

57:42.092 --> 57:43.469
Could you?

57:43.527 --> 57:46.633
Could you kill that child to
solve the world's problems

57:46.697 --> 57:49.234
and save the human race?

57:49.266 --> 57:52.907
Now, there's a twin
drive with that power

57:52.937 --> 57:56.475
and I know you tried to
access our encrypted files.

57:56.540 --> 57:58.486
Go fuck yourself!

57:59.743 --> 58:01.552
Now tell me, just
tell me where it is.

58:05.449 --> 58:06.450
Come on.

58:06.483 --> 58:07.325
Tell me.

58:07.384 --> 58:09.421
You're not saving lives.

58:09.453 --> 58:10.397
No.

58:12.222 --> 58:13.064
You're just a murderer.

58:13.090 --> 58:15.468
There is no murder in war!

58:15.492 --> 58:18.336
I wanna come over there and
beat you to fucking death

58:18.395 --> 58:20.602
with my fucking fist,
but I'm not gonna.

58:20.631 --> 58:22.907
'Cause I'm a gentleman now.

58:23.834 --> 58:25.609
There was a time
when I was a killer.

58:27.004 --> 58:29.450
Motherfucking American soldier.

58:29.473 --> 58:31.749
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you?

58:31.775 --> 58:33.777
I'm a patriot trying
to protect our freedom

58:33.811 --> 58:35.586
and safeguard our way of life.

58:35.613 --> 58:38.492
And though there are some even
though we loved that they die

58:38.515 --> 58:41.496
those sacrifices may
have saved millions.

58:41.518 --> 58:46.490
Now are you, are you a solider?

58:46.991 --> 58:51.963
Are you prepared to
die for your country?

58:55.666 --> 58:57.009
One more chance.

58:57.034 --> 58:58.172
Where is it?

59:02.339 --> 59:03.613
Fuck you!

59:04.642 --> 59:05.780
Doctor.

59:19.790 --> 59:22.737
Starting the countdown now.

59:24.395 --> 59:29.367
New listen to me, the price
of freedom is always high

59:31.135 --> 59:33.741
but Americans, true Americans,
have always paid it.

59:33.804 --> 59:36.978
But the path that we
shall never choose

59:37.007 --> 59:40.250
is the path of
surrender and submission

59:40.310 --> 59:43.154
to some cocksuckers, some
rag head motherfuckers,

59:43.180 --> 59:45.820
some Nazis, some
fucking British pricks,

59:45.849 --> 59:46.919
we ain't taking that path.

59:46.984 --> 59:50.329
You're on the wrong
side, soldier.

59:50.354 --> 59:53.392
You're on the wrong side.

59:53.424 --> 59:56.769
And if that drive falls
into the wrong hands

59:56.827 --> 59:59.671
our work will have
been for nothing.

59:59.697 --> 01:00:02.871
And trust me, you
stupid motherfucker,

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.744
I will not let that happen.

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.349
Good afternoon and get fucked.

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:24.259
[Voiceover] Mr. Norris,
Team 1 is waiting for you

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:25.631
in Bay 7.

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:30.128
It's time.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.630
Let's go.

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:39.111
The worst of all, gentlemen,

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.912
weapons are stronger, more
accurate than our soldiers,

01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:43.543
more vulnerable to field.

01:00:43.574 --> 01:00:46.919
But what I'm about
to show you now, sir,

01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:50.789
our soldiers will no
longer have to fear death.

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:55.094
A soldier who's
experience in training

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.427
can't be snuffed out.

01:00:57.588 --> 01:00:58.430
Listen to the bullet.

01:00:58.455 --> 01:00:59.832
(gun fires)

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.595
The ultimate weapon.

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:10.610
Okay, how long before these
units are ready for combat?

01:01:10.634 --> 01:01:12.409
Two weeks.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:13.847
Okay, interesting puppet show.

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:19.748
But you gotta remember, I got
real soldiers on the ground.

01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:21.851
I mean, we need stealth.

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:23.084
I mean, the element of surprise.

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:26.492
You know what, we need
to see the results.

01:01:26.517 --> 01:01:28.656
You need some dead
bodies and I got 'em.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.665
Follow me.

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:50.445
[Voiceover] Welcome
hack, Dr. Downey.

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:51.914
Could we have some
privacy, please?

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.546
I like the subject
to be relaxed.

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:03.031
[Voiceover] Lock engaged.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:07.468
(thrilling music)

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:10.820
Detective Walker.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:17.473
Chris Downey.

01:02:17.501 --> 01:02:21.244
We sorta met before with
my older partner Peterson?

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:23.182
What do you mean
your old partner?

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:25.346
There are things going on here

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:26.775
that you cannot
possibly understand.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.723
[Voiceover] Welcome
back, Mr. Norris.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:38.661
System activated.

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:43.401
Gentlemen, from
the central control

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:46.203
for the Subconscious Organization
Application Protocol

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.437
or SOAP as we call her.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:52.344
[Voiceover] 60 seconds to
subconscious transference.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:54.178
Live feed on screen.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:58.220
Pod 3 ready to initiate SOAP.

01:02:58.242 --> 01:02:59.016
Pod locked.

01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:00.749
Please step back.

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:06.118
Why the tubes?

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:07.355
The cryo tubes help take

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:08.556
the body's care
temperature down,

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:10.622
pulling the body into
nearly a frozen stale,

01:03:10.687 --> 01:03:13.634
to keep the mind the
target, switched off.

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:18.696
[Voiceover] Operation
Alpha 773 Tango in progress.

01:03:18.729 --> 01:03:20.572
And this is a live operation?

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:23.033
We wired it out on his ear

01:03:23.066 --> 01:03:24.506
when we detained
him for questioning.

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:27.412
Configuration complete.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:29.041
Execute when ready.

01:03:29.072 --> 01:03:30.915
[Voiceover] Executing.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:32.614
Subconscious
transference activated.

01:03:33.577 --> 01:03:35.989
Vapor initiated.

01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:38.985
Interface initiated.

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:41.620
Subconscious
transference in progress.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.826
Upload complete.

01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:57.136
Operation complete.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:01.513
Six high ranking terrorist
taken the fuck down.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:02.743
Zero American casualties.

01:04:02.773 --> 01:04:05.811
How do you safeguard
the life of the soldier?

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.584
Oh, there's some
calculated risk.

01:04:08.612 --> 01:04:11.923
If the soldier doesn't
SOAP back quick enough

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.519
and the target dies we
could conceivably lose

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:16.689
an American soldier but our
soldiers are so highly trained

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:17.993
there'd be very few deaths.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.694
If they fail, of
course we terminate

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:22.828
the dormant consciousness
in the soldier's body.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:24.429
We don't want these
terrorist walking around

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:27.374
in the highly capable
body of American troops.

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:29.468
No, we wouldn't.

01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:34.539
Sir, we've achieved in days
what would've taken years

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.777
and put numerous lives at risk.

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:44.489
(clapping)

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:49.486
Norris, now I am impressed.

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:52.667
And the world is a
safer place already.

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:57.230
Any time restrictions?

01:04:57.294 --> 01:04:59.205
A long ratio.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:00.537
And this has been tested?

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.347
We have living proof.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.981
By sabotaging your research.

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:10.747
I'm a man of science.

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:12.878
I do not believe in God.

01:05:13.744 --> 01:05:16.088
But I've been having dreams.

01:05:17.714 --> 01:05:20.718
Dreams of people I've never
met, places I've never been.

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:24.321
I'm seeing his memories.

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:26.766
(gun fires and explosion)

01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:35.608
We're not gonna
die today, soldier.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:36.837
Do you hear me?

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.686
Tell me, how was that possible?

01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:50.032
So the only thing left to say is

01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:56.026
just don't fuck this up.

01:05:56.053 --> 01:05:58.090
We've already spent
enough money on this.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:05:58.963
What do you think?

01:05:59.022 --> 01:05:59.762
Your board approved, Morgan.

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.531
We are in business.

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:03.060
That my friend
is a piece of cake.

01:06:04.261 --> 01:06:05.103
Bravo.

01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:21.820
This wasn't supposed
to be possible.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.386
The consciousness of the host

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.257
is supposed to
completely disappear.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.428
We spit in Mother Nature's
eye and she's fighting back.

01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:37.795
If takes one hour for the
bots to fully interface

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:39.000
the subject's brain.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.006
I mean, we don't
have a lot of time

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:42.270
before your wiring is complete.

01:06:42.299 --> 01:06:46.406
And than you're in the
SOAP system permanently.

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:47.847
They can do whatever
they want with you.

01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:51.351
Viewing your visual memories,
tracking your locations.

01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:55.823
Once they located the drive you
and your wife are both dead.

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:58.690
Trust me, you don't wanna
end up like Jack Simon.

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.288
Guard!

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:09.133
Help me hold him down while
I check his vitals, please.

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:19.673
(phone ringing)

01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:23.216
Detective Ross.

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:24.149
Have you seen Mitch?

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:25.118
I haven't heard from him.

01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:27.452
I'm scared.

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:31.821
I woke up and I can't
remember big chunks of time.

01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:34.720
And the last thing I
remember is giving blood

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.388
at the hospital with Katie.

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:39.663
I'm really worried about Mitch.

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:40.394
It's okay, Angie.

01:07:40.457 --> 01:07:41.834
Stay where you are.

01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:42.700
We'll find Mitch.

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.296
Just take care of Katie.

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:46.238
I'll send some units over to
keep an eye at the hospital

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:48.096
and I'll call you as
soon as we hear anything.

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:05.192
Senator Jones was trying
to shut down the program.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.759
Norris wasn't gonna
let that happen.

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.763
What the hell is this?

01:08:11.888 --> 01:08:13.231
A new way of warfare.

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:18.904
Norris has created
his awn kill list,

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:21.705
which includes high
ranking US officials

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:23.506
like Senator Jones.

01:08:24.701 --> 01:08:28.341
He's going to use you
like he used Jack Simon.

01:08:32.676 --> 01:08:34.781
Son of a bitch.

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:35.685
Shut it down.

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:36.884
It's not that simple.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.193
There's gotta be a kill switch.

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:39.724
We're here.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.457
Lower deck 5.

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:43.862
The only way to shut
down the program

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:47.300
is by directly tapping in
to the mainframe on level 2.

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:51.100
If requires several biometric
scans to get access.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.572
You'd be dead before you
ever get to the door.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.701
I'd be dead.

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:56.233
But you could walk right in.

01:08:57.367 --> 01:08:59.287
You're gonna show me how
to shut this thing down.

01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:07.916
Oh shit.

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:16.756
Oh shit.

Welcome back, Dr. Downey.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:37.577
Detective Ross.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:38.312
I did it.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.285
Mitch.

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:40.117
I snapped.

01:09:40.143 --> 01:09:40.779
What?

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:41.948
I killed him.

01:09:41.978 --> 01:09:43.184
I know there's a
lot stuff going on

01:09:43.246 --> 01:09:44.622
but just talk about this.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.184
I'll come get you.

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:47.125
Where are you?

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:50.791
Mitch, just slow down, buddy.

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:51.957
Slow down.

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.796
Do what you do.

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:55.666
Trace that call.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:56.762
It's Mitch.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:00.266
Trace that call.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:13.645
Shit.

01:10:30.794 --> 01:10:33.638
Hey there.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:35.643
All right, everyone just,
no one knocks anymore.

01:10:35.665 --> 01:10:36.871
You just walk in the door.

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:41.880
Dc you know why I'm here?

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.584
I ordered pizza
about an hour ago.

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:49.490
You don't look anything
like a pizza delivery guy,

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:52.220
sol have no idea
why you're here.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.090
Why are you here?

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:54.753
Hand over the drive.

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:55.990
Drive?

01:10:56.019 --> 01:10:58.693
I'm not sure what
you're talking, drive.

01:10:58.722 --> 01:11:00.599
I mean I can probably help you
with some sort of drive but...

01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:04.434
I'm not gonna
ask you again, boy.

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:06.371
Where's the goddamn drive?

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:13.380
Oh, the thumbdrive?

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:14.438
Come on.

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:15.744
You shoulda said the thumbdrive.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.615
I would've known what
you was talking about.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:18.880
Why did you say drive?

01:11:18.908 --> 01:11:21.115
That can mean many
different things.

01:11:21.177 --> 01:11:22.713
Thumbdrive.

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:23.520
There's no need to be
pointing guns in here

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:25.583
that's freaking crazy.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:28.425
If that's what you
wanted you can have it.

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:29.191
He gave it to me.

01:11:29.219 --> 01:11:30.197
I don't even want it.

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:30.721
It's yours.

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:31.562
Take it.

01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:32.708
Just take the fucking thing.

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:54.552
There's your drive.

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:02.853
Where are you?

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:04.817
I just want the drive.

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:08.728
(dramatic music)

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:32.683
(gunshot)

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.690
How much time do I have left?

01:13:41.718 --> 01:13:42.662
Two minutes.

01:13:42.685 --> 01:13:43.755
Now this building is owned

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.357

01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:48.164
We come in through

01:13:48.191 --> 01:13:49.499
There's three
floors that go down.

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:50.834
We don't know what the
hell is going on in there...

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.069
I need to talk
to Detective Mitch.

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:54.837
Hands.

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:56.343
Show me your hands.

01:13:56.366 --> 01:13:56.844
Show me your hands!

01:13:56.866 --> 01:13:58.436
Slow.

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:02.742
He had me working on this.

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:05.013
If got some crazy shit on it.

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:06.543
I just want to return it to him.

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:07.884
What do you gotta
go do with Walker?

01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:08.787
He's a suspect.

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:09.721
Mitch is a suspect?

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.193
Look, he hasn't done anything.

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:15.753
I've got the evidence
on this drive.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:19.198
It's got some assassinations
and some crazy,

01:14:19.222 --> 01:14:20.462
freakin' weapons.

01:14:20.523 --> 01:14:21.524
He's innocent.

01:14:21.558 --> 01:14:23.128
I don't want anything
to do with it.

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:24.535
Give me that.

01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:25.232
- I haven't seen anything.
- Give me that.

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:26.604

01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:20.486

01:15:28.992 --> 01:15:30.494
What a vision.

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:31.630
Nothing quite makes
me feel this good

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:34.141
as seeing much of free
Americans at ease.

01:15:35.498 --> 01:15:36.374
Enjoying themselves with no fear

01:15:36.432 --> 01:15:39.003
of some raghead attacking them,

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:42.278
kidnapping them or killing
them like they did my sun

01:15:42.305 --> 01:15:47.220
who died which brings
me to a subject

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:50.223
that I'd like to share with
you if you allow me a moment

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:51.690

amount of your time

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.216
if you just put down
your champagne glasses

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:55.319
and forks and I'll
be very brief.

01:16:00.957 --> 01:16:02.129
Ladies and gentlemen,
you know we're free

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:03.728
because we fought for it.

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:19.684
No, not good.

system shut down

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:23.984
it'll zap the entire mainframe
which will make this system

unstable but it
won't destroy it.

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:27.550
It's over.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:28.755
Norris is too powerful.

01:16:28.818 --> 01:16:30.258

outta here alive.

Best case scenario, you're
stuck in Norris' body.

01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:44.678
Worse case, you both die.

01:17:46.596 --> 01:17:48.598
I have a confession to make.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:52.343
I'm responsible for the
deaths of Senator Jones

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:55.939
and several other high
ranking government officials.

01:17:55.972 --> 01:17:58.145
This program is no good.

01:17:58.508 --> 01:18:02.820
It's no good for you, for me,

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:05.951
for our children,
or our country.

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:09.657
This is dangerous technology
in the hands of some men

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:11.596
who purport to be patriots
but are very dangerous men

01:18:11.621 --> 01:18:15.467
that should not be
allowed to exist.

01:18:16.592 --> 01:18:18.503
Just think about it now.

01:18:18.528 --> 01:18:23.500
A kid who never fire a gun in
his life, $300 to his name,

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:27.140
purchases an assault rifle

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:30.447
and shoots up a school with a
precision of a trained sniper

01:18:30.473 --> 01:18:33.511
killing dozens of young
children, and he does it

01:18:33.543 --> 01:18:36.547
on the eve of a crucial
vote on gun control.

01:18:36.612 --> 01:18:37.613
A coincidence?

01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:40.692
Hardly.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:43.560
Convenient, of course.

01:18:47.657 --> 01:18:51.662

the SOAP program

01:18:51.694 --> 01:18:55.369
be terminated post haste

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:58.641
and for good in perpetuity
forever and always.

[Voiceover]
Evacuate the premises.

01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:39.519
Get him out of there.

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:40.111
I've been trying it.

01:19:40.176 --> 01:19:41.280
It shut me out.

01:19:41.344 --> 01:19:43.017

heard what I said.

01:20:03.633 --> 01:20:05.271
Hey!

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:06.780
What the hell is going on?

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:13.981
Walker?

01:20:14.043 --> 01:20:15.113
You son of a bitch!

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:17.283
(gun fires)

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:28.057
Hello.

01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:30.730
Look, man, my name
is Mitch Walker

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.639
and I am a police officer.

01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:35.165

01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:39.678
This isn't what it looks like.

01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:42.077
I believe you.

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:48.115
I believe you're
a fucking traitor

01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:50.249
and a disgrace to your country.

01:20:50.279 --> 01:20:51.690
Fuck.

01:20:51.747 --> 01:20:53.818

01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:00.798

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.629
Come on let's go, old man.

01:23:47.656 --> 01:23:48.794
Who you callin' old man?

01:23:48.824 --> 01:23:51.031
I just saved your
ass back there.

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:56.334
(police siren)

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:57.708
Oh, here comes the cowboy.

01:24:10.312 --> 01:24:12.189
You got some real balls, Walker.

01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:15.220
Same pretty interesting
friends, too.

01:24:17.686 --> 01:24:18.824
Sir.

01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:29.002
You all right?

01:24:29.031 --> 01:24:31.170
I feel like I got
run over by a bus.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.406
But I'm pretty good.

01:24:32.468 --> 01:24:34.148
You never thanked me
for saving your ass.

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:37.080
You got the drive?

01:24:37.139 --> 01:24:38.550
It's in police custody.

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:39.814
He turned it in.

01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:42.753
But he never asked
me if I made a copy.

01:24:43.913 --> 01:24:45.893
If should be on the
airwaves by now.

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:59.567
Look who I found.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:15.615
You're the man.

01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:22.256
I'm sorry, baby.

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:24.628
I know you wouldn't do
anything to hurt Katie.

01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:30.603
(dramatic music)

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:16.570
You're gonna tell me what
the hell happened here?

01:26:18.073 --> 01:26:18.915
Maybe tomorrow.

01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:24.518
