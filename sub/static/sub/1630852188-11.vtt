BRAD, stop!

00:57.599 --> 00:58.808
[rock music stops]

00:59.768 --> 01:02.771
Sorry, guys. Guess Kash only has
one song loaded on this thing.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.023
[chuckles]
Not to worry.

01:05.106 --> 01:08.651
Just hearing you say you locked Kash away
is music enough for my ears.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.695
-[all laughing]
-We trapped Kash!

01:10.779 --> 01:12.280
-We trapped Kash!
-[Yaz] Yeah!

01:23.166 --> 01:24.375

[snoring]

01:29.672 --> 01:30.590
[exhales]

01:34.219 --> 01:37.055
Aw, he sleeps just like you.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.892
[groans, chuckles]

01:40.975 --> 01:42.894
Uh, Rebel, we gettin' up?

01:47.106 --> 01:50.026
On three. One, two, three.

-[Brooklynn chuckles]
-[Sammy cheers, laughs]

01:57.992 --> 01:58.868
[Sammy] All right!

01:58.952 --> 01:59.953
So, uh…

02:00.787 --> 02:03.289
should we tell them about us?

02:03.373 --> 02:05.041
[chuckles]
Really? Okay.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.503
But is it cool if I tell Darius first?

02:09.129 --> 02:12.632
Did you have a big, one-person
announcement planned or something?

02:12.715 --> 02:15.718
No, I just owe it to him
since we had that weird thing on the boat

02:15.802 --> 02:17.428
after you got kidnapped,
and I was being a jerk,

02:17.512 --> 02:18.972
because I figured I liked you. And--

02:19.055 --> 02:21.307
Wait, that's what that was?

02:22.475 --> 02:23.393
Uh…

02:23.476 --> 02:25.937
Okay, A, that's kind of adorable,

02:26.020 --> 02:30.108
and B, it's totally cool
if you want some guy time with Darius.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.234
I get it.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.319
Yeah? Uh…
[smooches]

02:33.403 --> 02:34.654
Okay, great. Thanks. Bye.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.657
-[Kenji] Darius!
-[groans]

02:40.493 --> 02:42.453
[groans, thuds]

02:43.163 --> 02:45.081
Hey, I think something's wrong with Rebel.

02:45.874 --> 02:49.043
-He's chill, but not usually this chill.
-[gasps]

02:49.127 --> 02:51.838
-Angel's acting weird too.
-[grunting]

02:51.921 --> 02:54.757
She's usually more bitey.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.842
[Ben] Here!

02:56.384 --> 02:57.594
Whoa.
[chuckles]

02:57.677 --> 02:58.636
Ah, yeah!

02:58.720 --> 03:00.930
-[Yaz] No issues for Firecracker.
-[Ben] No, no!

03:01.014 --> 03:03.182
She is right at home.

03:04.475 --> 03:05.810
Maybe that's the problem.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.730
Maybe they don't belong
here in the jungle biome.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.649
But Sinoceratops live in the jungle.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.817
It doesn't make sense.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.362
Well, they're also half Spinosaurus,
like the one in the desert biome.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.281
Maybe we should try there?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.033
Works for me.

03:20.116 --> 03:23.077
Hey! We're taking the kids to the desert!

03:23.161 --> 03:24.203
Yeah, have fun.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.290
[grunts]

03:27.373 --> 03:29.000
[gasps, grunts]

03:29.792 --> 03:31.544
[grunts, chomps]

03:32.795 --> 03:34.923
Oh, my berries aren't good enough.

03:35.924 --> 03:40.136
She expended a lot of energy
and needs something more substantial.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.681
With those irregular neck movements
and increase in drool production,

03:43.765 --> 03:45.767
you can tell berries just won't cut it.

03:46.351 --> 03:51.064
I could make you a nifty dinosaur
behavior chart if you'd like.

03:51.147 --> 03:54.817
Oh, I don't need a chart.
I've got my instincts.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.027
Sure, you have.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.447
Regardless, you did a good thing, Ben.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.199
She's finally free.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.451
But she's still got
that control chip in her.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.412
If that tech gets into the wrong hands…

04:07.705 --> 04:11.626
Then, I guess we better get
that chip out of her, huh?

04:11.709 --> 04:12.794
Can you do that?

04:12.877 --> 04:17.006
Can I… Benjamin, I'm a world
semi-famous scientist.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.758
[chuckles]
Of course, I can do that.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.762
Except, I'll need surgical equipment.

04:23.554 --> 04:24.973
-Aw, man.
-[Firecracker grunts]

04:26.140 --> 04:29.852
Mae and I are going to the Med Bay
to save Firecracker.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.562
[Darius] Cool. Be careful!

04:34.148 --> 04:35.692
Sorry, um, what were you saying?

04:36.776 --> 04:38.486
Remember on the boat when I was mad?

04:38.569 --> 04:41.114
I wasn't actually mad at you, I, I was…

04:41.781 --> 04:43.950
You, you don't need to apologize, Kenji.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.952
That's all in the past.
[laughs]

04:46.035 --> 04:48.037
I mean, man, that feels like years ago.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.622
No, I, I wasn't…

04:50.206 --> 04:51.416
Look, I wanted to…

04:55.670 --> 04:56.504
What?

04:56.587 --> 04:58.965
I just really missed you, Kenj.

04:59.757 --> 05:00.591
Yeah?

05:01.342 --> 05:03.511
I really missed you too, D.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.389
I'm so glad everything's back to normal.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.058
Oh, yeah, totally normal.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.977
No-nothing's changed at all.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.396
Good. Change is overrated.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.565
I do not think I could handle
one more thing.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.151
Sorry, you said you wanted to…

05:18.234 --> 05:19.319
Right.

05:19.402 --> 05:23.406
Wanted to ask you…

05:24.198 --> 05:26.534
who your favorite action hero is
and why, go.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.162
Uh…

05:29.245 --> 05:32.665

05:32.749 --> 05:35.877

-BRAD, stop!

05:36.836 --> 05:37.837
[alarm stops]

05:39.672 --> 05:41.382
Let's go feed that tattooed weasel.

05:42.383 --> 05:45.094
[Mae] Yes, I have a special bond
with Pierce,

05:45.178 --> 05:48.931
but all dinosaur behavior,
how and why they act the way they do,

05:49.015 --> 05:52.477
it can all be determined
based on observable data.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.689
I don't need "science" or "facts"
to know what FC does and doesn't like.

05:58.232 --> 06:01.986
That's what you need to know anything,
Ben, science and facts.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.196
Oh, yeah?

06:03.279 --> 06:06.324
Then how do I know
she doesn't like this conversation?

06:06.407 --> 06:10.078
[Mae] I don't think Firecracker's the one
who doesn't like this conversation.

06:12.413 --> 06:15.708
I can't believe you two are a couple!
[exclaims]

06:15.792 --> 06:18.586
I'm gonna call you Ken-lynn.
No, wait, Brook-ji.

06:19.337 --> 06:24.175
And as your biggest fan, I'm officially
dubbing myself a Brook-kenj-er.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.135
[laughs]

06:26.886 --> 06:28.304
And thanks for the push, Yaz.

06:28.387 --> 06:29.388
If it weren't for you,

06:29.472 --> 06:32.475
it would've taken me a lot longer
to figure out I liked him too.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.478
[gasps]
You helped Brooklynn with that?

06:35.561 --> 06:37.647
I may have.
[laughs]

06:37.730 --> 06:40.191
Yaz, girl, look at you.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.111
Giving advice, getting in touch
with your feelings.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.153

Never mind.

[dinosaurs snoring]

07:06.467 --> 07:08.719
Okay.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.888
So that's a no on the desert.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.599
-Aw, they're miserable.
-[snoring]

07:15.768 --> 07:18.896
Hey, when we were in the Arctic,
Rebel was super playful.

07:18.980 --> 07:19.939
Plus, look at them.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.941
They'd blend right in
with the snow and ice.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.985
That's, uh, that's gotta be
where they belong.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.945
Sorry, guys,
I should have thought of that sooner.

07:26.988 --> 07:31.159
-Huh?
-Ah, it's okay.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.202
You didn't know till you knew.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.663
You can't beat yourself up about this.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.499
-Oh, I, I wasn't.
-You know what?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.376
You're right, Yaz.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.296
Thanks for helping us
keep our emotions in check.

[Kenji imitates buzzer sound]
Time's up. Who's it gonna be?

08:34.222 --> 08:37.725
All right, all right.
I'd have to say Dr. Alan Grant.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.187
That's not an action hero, okay?
He's a real person.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.482
It has to be someone from a TV show
or a movie or something.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.817
He was in a riveting documentary I saw.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.904
Well, who's your pick then?

08:51.113 --> 08:54.242
Obviously, either Dante Mathews
or Oliver Graham.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.244
I think I'm more of a Graham.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.663
Then again, Mathews has a girlfriend.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.833
I don't know who either of them are.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.712
What? You don't know Mathews and Graham?

09:06.796 --> 09:09.340
From the <i>Esther Stone,</i>
<i>High School P.I. </i>spin-off?

09:11.259 --> 09:14.345
Dude, they're only, like,
the greatest action duo of all time.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.270
[normal voice]
What? That's not the line.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.565
No, Kenji. The door is open.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.775
[suspenseful music]

09:29.944 --> 09:31.529
How did he get out?

09:31.612 --> 09:32.655
Where'd he go?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.323
I don't know.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.243
Probably back to his compound
or the Med Bay or…

09:37.326 --> 09:38.327
[gasps]

09:38.411 --> 09:39.370
[both] Ben and Mae.

[machine beeping]

09:52.300 --> 09:53.301
[gasps]

09:54.135 --> 09:55.136
[Mae] Got it.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.307
Thanks, Mae.

10:00.141 --> 10:03.894
It's nice to be around an adult
who loves dinosaurs as much as we do.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.981
Even if you need science to prove it.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.444
That's the whole point of science, Ben,

10:11.527 --> 10:13.362
to prove things.
[chuckles]

10:14.655 --> 10:15.615
[dinosaur moans]

10:15.698 --> 10:17.700
[Ben laughs]
You're okay.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.372
[suspenseful music]

10:25.583 --> 10:27.251
Okay, looks like he's not here.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.128
Hurry. You go down and get Mae and Ben.

10:29.211 --> 10:32.214
I'm gonna try to move the drones
and lock Kash out from the inside.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.507
[door chimes]

10:35.593 --> 10:36.427
Good luck.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.095
Wait.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.723
Now you say, "I'm not gonna need it."

10:42.016 --> 10:43.559
But I am gonna need it.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.269
[sighs]

10:51.609 --> 10:53.319
-[Kash] Check it, boss.
-[gasps]

10:53.402 --> 10:54.904
[Kash] We just get rid of the Kentro.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.157
-[Darius grunts]
-[Kash] It's injured

10:58.240 --> 11:02.036
and it broke off a tail spike,
so it's not even that cool anymore.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.747
[Daniel] Always so shortsighted, Kash.

11:05.247 --> 11:08.250
It's no wonder you got outsmarted
by a child.

11:09.043 --> 11:09.877
[gasps]

11:12.213 --> 11:15.633
[Daniel] The assets in the new biome
were devouring their food supply

11:15.716 --> 11:17.593
at an unprecedented rate.

11:18.094 --> 11:22.014
Let's see if two tons of Kentrosaurus
will satiate them.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.974
You released those things already?

11:24.058 --> 11:26.018
I haven't figured out a way
to contain them.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.186
The drones don't work because--

11:27.269 --> 11:29.688
[Daniel] Doesn't matter
because we won't be there.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.899
The BRADs will take care
of the Kentrosaurus

11:31.982 --> 11:34.777
while we prep the forest biome
for the presentation.

11:35.444 --> 11:39.365

12:15.609 --> 12:16.694
No.

12:34.670 --> 12:35.713
You're welcome.

We don't need a push.
We just need a minute.

Are you all right?

13:31.185 --> 13:32.686
Kenji told us Kash escaped.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.188
Kash's boss is here.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.815
The president of Mantah Corp?

13:36.899 --> 13:39.443
I've never met the man.
Is he as heartless as Kash?

13:39.527 --> 13:41.529
He might be worse.

13:41.612 --> 13:45.366
Mae, he's having the BRADs take Pierce
to a new biome with new assets.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.825
They're gonna use him as food.

13:46.909 --> 13:47.868
[both] What?

13:47.952 --> 13:49.995
-There's a new biome?
-[sighs]

13:50.079 --> 13:53.457
It was under construction for a while,
but they must have just finished it.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.793
The airlock is just through these trees.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.628
We've got to go save Pierce.

13:57.711 --> 14:01.090
You guys try to stop the BRADs,
and Kenji and I will stop the new dinos.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.383
I just hope we're not too late.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.098
Kash was terrified of the new dinos,

14:09.181 --> 14:11.475

to protect him.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.929

14:49.013 --> 14:51.348
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.976
I'm crying because I'm angry at you, Yaz!

14:55.269 --> 14:57.438
At… At me? What did I do?

14:58.022 --> 15:00.900
We didn't wanna leave, but you made us,
and now, we're gonna freeze to death.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.903
And I know I shouldn't be sad
to leave Angel and Rebel, but I am!

15:03.986 --> 15:07.239
And I know I shouldn't cry,
but my eyes just leak like this.

Oh, I can feel my fingers again. Ah.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.318
How can they handle this kind of cold?

15:44.401 --> 15:49.073
Oh, Mantah Corp must have genetically
engineered them to be endothermic

15:49.156 --> 15:51.116
since they're creating
their own body heat,

15:51.200 --> 15:54.578

way too much time with Darius.

we did this.
