<i>GRACE: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager... </i>

00:02.917 --> 00:04.583
I have to go back to my family.

00:04.591 --> 00:06.796
If her parents want her back in Houston,

00:06.796 --> 00:08.446
they want her back in Houston

00:08.493 --> 00:10.175
and we shouldn't interfere with that.

00:10.222 --> 00:12.506
But maybe Ethan should.

00:12.537 --> 00:14.953
Why would you think I'm going
to back out of the wedding now?

00:14.977 --> 00:17.237
Because you bought that dress.

00:17.242 --> 00:18.410
Are you serious about her?

00:18.433 --> 00:20.631
I don't know yet. Are
you serious about her?

00:20.639 --> 00:22.633
Because for some reason,
George seems to think

00:22.633 --> 00:25.808
that you're either interested in
Anne or you're interested in me.

00:25.928 --> 00:27.685
So, you don't think they're married?

00:27.724 --> 00:29.375
Or you don't think
they'll get married again?

00:29.495 --> 00:30.969
What? No. I didn't say that.

00:30.970 --> 00:32.644
- Your face said that.
- No, it didn't.

00:32.659 --> 00:33.919
Uh-huh, it did.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.647
School starts again tomorrow.

00:35.767 --> 00:38.932
I hate school. I'm like two years behind

00:38.917 --> 00:42.214
and it would be three, but then they'd
have to put me back in middle school.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.462
I don't know why I'm not happy.

00:44.582 --> 00:47.186
You're tired of doing what
everyone else wants you to do

00:47.306 --> 00:49.040
and you just want to run away.

00:49.074 --> 00:49.889
Yeah.

00:49.905 --> 00:51.342
Robie is not your son.

00:51.376 --> 00:54.111
He could be. He looks like mine.

00:54.146 --> 00:55.994
If you'd rather have the window seat... 

00:56.114 --> 00:57.181
What are you doing?

00:57.216 --> 00:59.337
I'm going home with you.

01:09.831 --> 01:11.998
Oh! Hi there, Counselor.

01:11.990 --> 01:13.554
Hi. What brings you by?

01:13.554 --> 01:14.790
Uh, school?

01:14.821 --> 01:16.455
School's over. Where have you been?

01:16.455 --> 01:19.083
And, by any chance,
has Ethan been with you?

01:19.120 --> 01:22.563
Yes, he has. But he should
be halfway to Texas by now.

01:22.884 --> 01:25.125
Uh, his foster parents
gave him permission to go.

01:25.159 --> 01:27.560
And I gave him the encouragement
and a ride to the airport,

01:27.591 --> 01:30.900
and, hopefully, I've changed the
lives of two teenagers for the better.

01:30.884 --> 01:32.917
- Because... 
- Because I'm a dreamer

01:32.956 --> 01:34.747
and a self-appointed dream maker.

01:34.739 --> 01:36.108
I want to make his dreams come true.

01:36.139 --> 01:36.984
And what dream was that?

01:36.999 --> 01:40.182
The dream of actually making that
first love the love of his life.

01:40.207 --> 01:41.402
Isn't that your dream?

01:41.418 --> 01:42.520
Well, isn't that everyone's dream?

01:42.528 --> 01:45.508
Have you thought about
going back to counseling?

01:45.547 --> 01:48.996
Mmm, many times, but no longer necessary.

01:52.532 --> 01:54.518
Hey, glad I found you.

01:54.638 --> 01:58.172
Just need you to sign off on
the paperwork for my school.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.712
Oh, Omar, we're gonna miss you around here.

02:00.697 --> 02:03.296
And I'm gonna miss you. And this school.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.655
This was a good experience,

02:05.775 --> 02:09.393
except for the first day and
the months of investigation,

02:09.448 --> 02:11.755
but everything turned out
fine in the end, I guess.

02:11.755 --> 02:12.686
So what's next?

02:12.709 --> 02:15.877
I don't know. I'm trying to
get my first real teaching job,

02:15.869 --> 02:19.179
but I have an interview with
a production company today.

02:19.213 --> 02:21.314
I have this idea I want to pitch to them.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.017
It's really a personal project, you
know, just something I want to do.

02:24.051 --> 02:25.218
- Oh?
- Eh.

02:25.252 --> 02:27.592
Got me an interview, but
we'll see how it goes.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.353
I don't want to talk about
it, I don't want to jinx it.

02:31.158 --> 02:33.075
Thanks for everything.

02:34.491 --> 02:37.275
Oh, if anything opens up here,
you'll be the first to know.

02:37.275 --> 02:38.164
Thanks.

02:40.865 --> 02:42.360
(SIGHS)

02:45.282 --> 02:47.898
Oh. I thought the student
teaching gig was up.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.925
I never got a chance to say
goodbye but I guess I don't need to.

02:50.907 --> 02:53.228
The gig is up. So, bye, Ben.

02:53.214 --> 02:56.374
I know I caused you a little trouble here,

02:56.399 --> 02:58.395
but all's well that ends well, right?

02:58.395 --> 02:59.996
I guess. Yeah. Sure.

03:00.003 --> 03:02.799
And look, Adrian is a very nice woman,

03:02.837 --> 03:05.064
and I hope that you two
are very happy together.

03:05.184 --> 03:08.228
I hope that you two get married
and have lots of children,

03:08.262 --> 03:10.150
and good health and a happy life.

03:10.175 --> 03:12.822
Wow. Uh... thank you.

03:13.167 --> 03:15.331
And have a nice day.

03:15.337 --> 03:16.777
I'm having a stupendous day.

03:16.745 --> 03:19.004
- Stupendous, huh?
- Yeah. See ya.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.901
Amy! Happy I ran into you.

03:22.895 --> 03:25.610
Yeah, I heard you took
Ethan to the airport?

03:25.642 --> 03:26.843
Guilty as charged.

03:26.881 --> 03:29.415
He's on his way with Kathy to
start their new life together.

03:29.415 --> 03:30.704
He's not moving to Texas, is he?

03:30.691 --> 03:32.950
Oh, hell no. No, no.
He's coming back with her.

03:32.956 --> 03:35.896
<i>It's Casablanca with a return
flight and a happy ending.</i>

03:35.903 --> 03:37.811
Oh, Ben, ever the romantic.

03:37.793 --> 03:41.972
Maybe not so much. Goodbye,
Amy Juergens. Hello, life!

Where the hell were you?

04:09.788 --> 04:12.365
Did you forget that I was gonna
need a ride home from school?

04:12.485 --> 04:14.161
- Ben... 
- Oh. Geez.

04:14.178 --> 04:16.649
I'm sorry. I did. I forgot all about you.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.034
I thought you were my
brother, my big brother,

04:19.047 --> 04:21.327
and that you'd be looking
out for me today at school.

04:21.374 --> 04:23.236
- Did something happen?
- No!

04:23.270 --> 04:25.138
But something could have happened.

04:25.122 --> 04:26.918
Ben, you knew Chloe was feeling anxious

04:26.924 --> 04:28.344
about going back to school. Where were you?

04:28.319 --> 04:29.083
That's not important,

04:29.101 --> 04:30.942
the important thing is
that nothing happened.

04:30.966 --> 04:34.175
Everything is fine. You're
fine. And I do apologize,

04:34.206 --> 04:36.759
but I had some important
business to attend to.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.242
Yeah. I heard. You drove
Ethan to the airport.

04:39.649 --> 04:41.106
I could have ridden with you, you know.

04:41.144 --> 04:44.122
Well, I don't think that you should
skip school, even if Ben does,

04:44.135 --> 04:44.985
you're trying to catch up.

04:44.992 --> 04:46.800
Why did you drive Ethan to the airport?

04:46.838 --> 04:49.653
Because he's totally in
love with Kathy and... 

04:49.672 --> 04:53.232
And you don't want to see him
lose her like you lost Amy.

04:53.414 --> 04:55.697
Geez. You are such an idiot!

04:55.716 --> 04:56.655
I couldn't agree more.

04:56.686 --> 04:58.107
Chloe and I are going to the bookstore.

04:58.155 --> 04:59.445
We're buying a set of the classics.

04:59.464 --> 05:01.973
She's gonna be trying to catch
up at home on her own time,

05:02.005 --> 05:03.908
while she still goes to
classes with everyone else.

05:03.938 --> 05:05.371
Good for you, let me know if I can help.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.716
Oh, yeah, you're a big help.

05:06.722 --> 05:08.374
Your dad said we should
all meet at Geoff's at 7:00.

05:08.393 --> 05:09.519
I think I'll just get something here.

05:09.537 --> 05:10.576
Let your dad know.

05:10.582 --> 05:12.528
On second thought, I'll see you at 7:00.

05:16.964 --> 05:20.010
Hey, I didn't say anything about... 

05:20.823 --> 05:21.812
you know.

05:30.799 --> 05:32.526
I don't like surprises.

05:32.532 --> 05:34.910
I didn't mean to surprise you.

05:35.030 --> 05:38.228
It was last minute. I
literally ran onto the plane.

05:38.262 --> 05:40.096
Otherwise, one of us would have called you.

05:40.096 --> 05:41.841
You don't have my phone number,

05:42.735 --> 05:43.893
- do you?
- Well... 

05:45.795 --> 05:47.196
- no.
- Good.

05:47.922 --> 05:49.153
Let's keep it that way.

05:49.668 --> 05:50.512
So... 

05:51.720 --> 05:53.052
state your case.

05:53.033 --> 05:54.654
Uh, okay.

05:54.673 --> 05:57.061
Is it possible to get
something to eat first?

05:57.181 --> 06:00.235
We had an early dinner on the
way to the airport. Thank heavens.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.338
After the airport, I
wouldn't have had an appetite.

06:04.189 --> 06:07.368
They didn't feed you on the
flight? No food in first class?

06:07.374 --> 06:10.020
They fed us but it wasn't a meal,

06:11.195 --> 06:12.710
and I have a high metabolism.

06:12.723 --> 06:14.037
That's because you're young.

06:15.746 --> 06:17.916
Too young to be in a serious relationship,

06:18.185 --> 06:19.354
and so is Kathy.

06:19.474 --> 06:21.469
So, state your case.

06:21.477 --> 06:23.659
And don't waste my time. Or yours.

06:23.855 --> 06:25.433
You're flying back tonight,

06:25.445 --> 06:27.034
you're going straight back to that airport.

06:27.058 --> 06:28.952
Yes, I know that.

06:28.944 --> 06:30.994
Just say what you want to say, then.

06:31.422 --> 06:32.387
The clock is ticking.

06:32.411 --> 06:33.628
Okay. Um,

06:35.795 --> 06:36.664
should I stand?

06:36.784 --> 06:37.681
Why not?

06:42.151 --> 06:43.367
To begin,

06:44.656 --> 06:46.686
you don't seem that angry that I'm here.

06:46.989 --> 06:47.774
You seem

06:48.371 --> 06:49.572
more, like, annoyed,

06:50.159 --> 06:52.280
but not, like, so angry
that you wouldn't at least

06:52.348 --> 06:54.122
consider letting Kathy go back with me.

06:54.118 --> 06:55.035
I'm angry,

06:55.920 --> 06:57.041
I'm just civil.

06:58.054 --> 06:58.738
Go ahead.

06:58.763 --> 06:59.756
Thank you for clarifying.

07:02.074 --> 07:03.423
Okay, so... 

07:05.457 --> 07:06.991
Kathy has been through a lot.

07:07.007 --> 07:07.944
Yes,

07:08.420 --> 07:09.862
and so has her mother,

07:10.907 --> 07:11.676
and so have I.

07:11.708 --> 07:12.605
Whatever you say.

07:13.622 --> 07:15.100
Although, shipping her
off to her grandmother

07:15.116 --> 07:16.954
doesn't seem as if you
went through a lot to me.

07:17.574 --> 07:18.884
Phone call, plane ticket,

07:18.892 --> 07:20.385
a few lies to your friends, done!

07:21.222 --> 07:23.428
Whereas Kathy had to move away from home,

07:24.001 --> 07:26.729
away from her friends, away
from everything she knew.

07:27.610 --> 07:28.943
She had to go to a new school

07:28.947 --> 07:30.665
and keep up with her
schoolwork while she... 

07:32.936 --> 07:34.305
you know, while she had a baby.

07:34.301 --> 07:35.886
Tell me something I don't know.

07:36.319 --> 07:37.104
I know all of this,

07:37.148 --> 07:38.730
and... 

07:39.559 --> 07:41.405
that's what you get when you're a teenager

07:41.397 --> 07:42.494
and you get pregnant.

07:43.110 --> 07:44.816
There are limited options,

07:45.009 --> 07:46.818
and moving was Kathy's best option.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.243
Drop-kicked to Grandma's house?

07:48.584 --> 07:49.793
That was her best option?

07:51.434 --> 07:52.788
I won't argue the point.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.803
Anyway, Kathy has been through a lot,

07:55.803 --> 07:56.436
and... 

07:56.616 --> 07:59.047
she's just really settling in

07:59.043 --> 08:00.648
and focusing on school

08:00.668 --> 08:01.409
and getting comfortable.

08:01.421 --> 08:02.682
I don't want her... 

08:03.210 --> 08:04.055
comfortable.

08:04.075 --> 08:06.134
She shouldn't be comfortable!

08:06.382 --> 08:09.330
She shouldn't be going out on dates,

08:09.352 --> 08:12.060
having a good time, enjoying herself.

08:12.121 --> 08:12.857
Because?

08:12.861 --> 08:15.812
Because there's a lesson
to be learned here.

08:16.328 --> 08:19.161
What, she just has a baby and just goes
back to her life as if nothing happened?

08:20.160 --> 08:21.229
Guilt is a good thing.

08:23.532 --> 08:25.045
And so is a small amount of shame.

08:25.057 --> 08:26.879
(LAUGHS SCORNFULLY)

08:26.919 --> 08:28.296
You're kidding, right?

08:28.605 --> 08:30.750
She should walk around
hanging her head or something?

08:31.099 --> 08:33.260
Wait. You don't also believe in
smacking her around or anything?

08:33.253 --> 08:33.789
No.

08:34.402 --> 08:35.491
- I do not.
- Good.

08:36.111 --> 08:37.708
'Cause if you did, I would
smack you right here and now.

08:37.712 --> 08:39.856
And I won't feel the least
bit guilty or ashamed.

08:43.126 --> 08:44.126
Hit me.

08:44.288 --> 08:45.281
Go ahead.

08:45.573 --> 08:46.630
See what happens.

08:46.646 --> 08:47.289
- Stop!
- Stop!

08:48.324 --> 08:49.885
Edward! What are you doing?

08:50.141 --> 08:50.802
Ethan!

08:51.147 --> 08:52.055
Don't hit my father.

08:52.076 --> 08:52.924
He said to hit him.

08:52.948 --> 08:54.458
Everyone! Sit.

09:02.299 --> 09:04.020
I thought you guys were
making sandwiches or something.

09:04.026 --> 09:04.877
I'm really hungry.

09:04.997 --> 09:06.497
Enough with that.

09:07.292 --> 09:08.812
Say what you want to say

09:08.862 --> 09:09.957
and get the hell out of here.

09:09.988 --> 09:11.227
- Both of us?
- BOTH: Him.

09:11.347 --> 09:13.455
If I could just have some
chips, a cracker, anything... 

09:13.480 --> 09:15.050
- Are you okay?
- No!

09:16.508 --> 09:17.753
Evelyn!

09:21.290 --> 09:22.427
You rang?

09:22.771 --> 09:25.724
Could you please make my friend a sandwich?

09:25.718 --> 09:26.776
(LAUGHING)

09:26.819 --> 09:28.296
I think he's getting a little delirious.

09:28.615 --> 09:29.654
Why not?

09:34.967 --> 09:37.226
He doesn't have a housekeeper at his house,

09:37.346 --> 09:39.810
he doesn't know that she would
bring the sandwich to him.

09:41.105 --> 09:42.325
He's sweet!

09:42.857 --> 09:45.041
Don't you think it was
sweet of him to come here?

09:45.348 --> 09:47.293
Sweet and brave.

09:50.602 --> 09:52.755
Okay, kid, listen up.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.156
You got to be a man here.

09:54.276 --> 09:57.379
Her dad's isn't gonna let
her go back to La-la Land

09:57.391 --> 09:58.342
with just some guy.

09:58.361 --> 09:59.481
You got to prove yourself.

09:59.506 --> 10:01.664
You know, you got to get his attention.

10:01.677 --> 10:03.146
Show some testosterone.

10:03.266 --> 10:05.133
What kind of chips are these? They're hot!

10:05.167 --> 10:07.114
(SCOFFS) Man up! This is Texas.

10:07.126 --> 10:08.402
I'm a man who doesn't like hot.

10:08.428 --> 10:10.467
Yeah, whatever. That guy in there,

10:10.587 --> 10:11.962
he breeds horses for a living,

10:11.944 --> 10:13.171
and he's a tough guy.

10:13.291 --> 10:15.410
And if you're going to come up against him,

10:15.444 --> 10:16.968
you're going to need some cajones.

10:16.981 --> 10:19.377
I don't get hot. Why do people want hot?

10:27.857 --> 10:29.490
I don't even like her.

10:30.121 --> 10:33.331
She bought a rag for a wedding dress.

10:33.669 --> 10:35.070
It's a rag.

10:35.877 --> 10:37.717
She says she's going to fix it up,

10:38.355 --> 10:40.770
but I think she just didn't want
to waste any money on a dress

10:40.795 --> 10:42.253
when she knows she's never gonna wear it.

10:42.278 --> 10:43.848
I admit. I did hear about the dress.

10:43.898 --> 10:46.038
So, even her best friends
think it's a rag, don't they?

10:46.019 --> 10:48.128
It's her dress, her decision.

10:48.159 --> 10:50.993
Yeah, I know, and I told her that,

10:51.525 --> 10:53.853
and I apologized for
getting all crazy about it,

10:53.916 --> 10:56.806
but it's not just about
the dress, I know it's not.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.315
I've been working my ass off.

10:59.966 --> 11:01.543
I'm studying really hard,

11:01.537 --> 11:03.808
I'm working really hard,
I'm paying the bills,

11:03.801 --> 11:05.028
I cook most of the meals,

11:05.066 --> 11:07.318
I do my share of taking care of John.

11:08.113 --> 11:11.848
I'm tired of arguing with
Amy. I'm tired of Amy.

11:14.871 --> 11:16.346
I don't want to get married.

11:16.350 --> 11:17.354
But you're already married.

11:17.390 --> 11:18.741
No, I'm not. We lied.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.354
I don't know what it is.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.034
It took me years to fall in love with Amy,

11:28.718 --> 11:32.588
and I am in love with Amy,

11:33.956 --> 11:36.342
But I know she's not in love with me,

11:37.927 --> 11:41.791
and I want a woman who's

11:42.586 --> 11:44.563
totally in love with me.

11:45.902 --> 11:47.904
I deserve that

11:48.279 --> 11:49.685
and I'm gonna have that.

11:49.706 --> 11:51.201
You say you lied?

11:51.658 --> 11:54.073
About being married? You're not married?

11:55.878 --> 11:56.607
Hmm?

No, we're not married.

Cut what off, sweetie?

12:16.141 --> 12:18.374
The cast. This one. The
one holding up my arm.

12:18.494 --> 12:19.512
Because?

12:19.531 --> 12:20.933
Because I don't have a broken arm anymore.

12:20.939 --> 12:22.947
Really? How's that?

12:22.985 --> 12:24.830
- It's a miracle.
- Yeah, it would be a miracle

12:24.874 --> 12:27.557
if your arm that's broken in three places

12:27.577 --> 12:29.504
healed weeks before the
doctors said it would.

12:29.479 --> 12:31.700
Well, I can feel it. It's
healed in all three places.

12:31.706 --> 12:33.629
Well, the doctor will tell
you when your arm is healed,

12:33.614 --> 12:35.717
and he'll take the cast off for you, okay?

12:35.751 --> 12:37.011
I'm getting the cast off,

12:37.023 --> 12:39.244
and I'm getting back on the
field before spring training.

12:39.282 --> 12:40.683
What about your broken leg?

12:40.723 --> 12:42.285
Well, when I get my arm free,

12:42.310 --> 12:43.643
I'm gonna cut the cast off my leg as well.

12:43.659 --> 12:45.126
Oh, because your leg has healed too?

12:45.157 --> 12:47.543
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord, and pass the sanity.

12:47.585 --> 12:50.081
Jack! I'm trying to study,
okay? Why don't you just... 

12:50.895 --> 12:52.582
why don't you just try to settle down,

12:52.622 --> 12:54.324
and watch a little TV or something?

12:54.562 --> 12:57.396
I think the Mighty Hour is on.

12:57.573 --> 12:59.736
I mean, if this is a miracle,
I think I could get on that.

13:00.148 --> 13:01.831
Come on, Grace, just
cut the cast off for me.

13:01.825 --> 13:04.815
I can't cut a cast off with
my mother's pinking shears.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.792
She doesn't have one of
those little saws, does she?

13:06.780 --> 13:07.605
No. She does not.

13:07.624 --> 13:09.145
Well, can you take me
over to the emergency room?

13:09.163 --> 13:11.616
No, I cannot take you to the
emergency room, I'm trying to study.

13:11.622 --> 13:13.987
Grace, you know, you're the one
who got me back into Christianity,

13:14.012 --> 13:15.876
I thought you'd be a little
more excited about this.

13:15.889 --> 13:17.259
What does Christianity
have to do with this?

13:17.278 --> 13:18.573
I prayed that my bones would heal.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.782
Faster than anyone else's bones on Earth?

13:20.826 --> 13:22.678
Well, I didn't think about
it like that, but why not?

13:22.665 --> 13:24.480
Because bones heal like bones heal.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.806
They just need time. Okay?

13:25.837 --> 13:28.221
I don't have a lot of time,
I have to work out for months

13:28.227 --> 13:31.062
before spring practice starts,
and I've got twig arm over here.

13:31.106 --> 13:32.507
Why don't you pray your twig arm gets

13:32.532 --> 13:33.965
little muscle tone while its healing?

13:33.997 --> 13:36.731
Come on, Grace! Surely,
if God saved me from death,

13:36.775 --> 13:37.675
he can heal bones.

13:37.682 --> 13:40.463
Surely if God gave you
doctors to set bones,

13:40.478 --> 13:43.368
surely you can wait until the bones
are healed to get the damn cast off.

possibility of employment there.

- Really nice.
- Mmm.

right about the furniture.

It's a big business.

14:49.087 --> 14:50.394

And if you make it in the big
business of jury selection,

14:53.661 --> 14:55.723
are you going to be okay
being married to a teacher?

15:51.389 --> 15:53.335

I don't know what I'm saying.

16:18.749 --> 16:20.545

16:21.208 --> 16:22.690
I don't think she wants me.

16:22.678 --> 16:23.879
No two women are alike.

16:23.999 --> 16:25.324
The relationship you have with Amy

16:25.330 --> 16:27.295
is certainly a more
complicated relationship

16:27.288 --> 16:28.565
than the one you had with Adrian.

16:28.564 --> 16:30.229
It certainly is, yeah.

I don't want complicated.
I'm tired of complicated.

16:33.522 --> 16:36.047
Wait a minute. Are you trying... 

16:36.528 --> 16:39.950
Are you trying to justify
sleeping with someone else?

16:40.163 --> 16:41.289
Are you cheating on Amy?

16:41.302 --> 16:42.647
Amy is my wife.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.819
Or, she's like my wife.

16:45.844 --> 16:47.020
That wasn't the question.

16:49.279 --> 16:52.213
- Adrian?
- No. Not Adrian.

16:52.675 --> 16:54.666
And I just thought about
cheating a few times.

16:54.660 --> 16:55.942
I wouldn't really do anything.

16:56.062 --> 16:56.556
Why is that?

16:56.787 --> 16:58.120
Because I love Amy.

16:58.714 --> 17:00.679
I have to love her.

17:00.723 --> 17:01.799
You have to?

17:02.512 --> 17:03.394
Why is that?

17:03.450 --> 17:05.621
Because I want the perfect

17:05.877 --> 17:07.654
family for our son.

You know,

17:09.299 --> 17:11.069

being able to say the worst
of what you're thinking...

17:32.691 --> 17:35.244

17:35.364 --> 17:37.052
Oh. Maybe he's in the mood for a booth.

17:37.102 --> 17:38.422
Right this way.

- Hi.
- Hi.

I'm meeting my parents here.

You have a reservation for
three under Prince Albert?

17:58.630 --> 18:00.320
We do.

18:00.495 --> 18:02.985
And does your dad always go
under the name of Prince Albert?

18:02.991 --> 18:06.057
Yeah, it used to make me
laugh when I was a kid,

18:06.177 --> 18:08.197
but I'm not that easily amused anymore.

18:08.447 --> 18:09.342
Are they here?

18:09.367 --> 18:10.631
No, but would you like to be seated?

18:10.669 --> 18:11.638
Yes, please.

- Right this way.

- I'm meeting my family.

18:28.682 --> 18:32.199
Oh, brother. Looks like we've been had.

18:32.417 --> 18:33.888
I'm not following you.

Has your family eaten here?

18:36.710 --> 18:40.595
No, it's the club and
home, and that's about it.

18:40.715 --> 18:42.885
My mom cooks dinner almost every night.

18:43.005 --> 18:44.668
But you know that.

18:44.712 --> 18:45.957
Yeah, I do know that.

18:46.832 --> 18:48.096
You look really nice.

18:59.065 --> 19:01.361
And the classes are difficult

19:01.542 --> 19:04.276
and the girls hate us because
we're the new girls. But... 

19:04.396 --> 19:05.352
whatever.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.986
It's funny that my dad would
set this up for tonight.

19:08.042 --> 19:10.334
- Why's that?
- Oh. I don't know.

19:10.369 --> 19:13.467
I've just been having
a really wonderful day

19:13.587 --> 19:15.056
and this makes it all the better.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.478
I was having a really bad day and

19:17.471 --> 19:18.929
this makes it all the better.

19:19.104 --> 19:21.894
I wasn't ready for you
the first time around.

19:22.476 --> 19:24.704
Or the second. But... (CHUCKLES)

19:24.948 --> 19:26.670
Would you be up for a third time around?

19:26.707 --> 19:28.134
I don't know Ben.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.323
I mean, what's the point?

19:30.555 --> 19:32.451
I want to be with you. But... 

19:32.782 --> 19:34.209
I know you want to be with Amy.

19:34.259 --> 19:36.227
Yeah, about that... 

19:38.419 --> 19:40.872
Funny thing happened on the
way to the airport today.

19:44.626 --> 19:46.515
Don't worry. You'll make it.

19:47.379 --> 19:50.738
I can't believe I'm doing
this, it's so exciting.

19:51.601 --> 19:55.412
I know I can get her parents to let
her come back here, I just know it.

19:56.381 --> 19:58.584
Just like I know, someday, that

19:58.835 --> 20:00.499
I'll ask her to marry me.

20:01.420 --> 20:04.347
We'll have a wedding and
invite all our friends,

20:04.879 --> 20:06.130
and we'll have children

20:06.250 --> 20:08.833
and name them after people
who have been good to us.

20:10.222 --> 20:11.768
We'll live in a little house

20:11.836 --> 20:13.713
with a little yard, with a dog,

20:13.776 --> 20:16.110
and couple of cats, and a big TV.

20:16.230 --> 20:17.368
Been there.

20:20.914 --> 20:23.704
So tell me, huh? How'd you
fall in love with Amy Juergens?

20:24.130 --> 20:26.219
It was the first day of school.

20:26.339 --> 20:28.215
I was smitten with Grace Bowman,

20:28.221 --> 20:30.128
only she was a Christian back then, too,

20:30.650 --> 20:33.515
and Alice told me that she
would never go out with me,

20:33.553 --> 20:34.829
but maybe someone else would.

20:35.086 --> 20:37.770
And then she directed my
attention to Amy Juergens.

20:39.421 --> 20:41.961
So, she found Amy for you.

20:41.942 --> 20:42.373
What?

20:42.493 --> 20:44.614
Your friend Alice picked out Amy for you.

20:44.651 --> 20:46.340
Well, I mean... 

20:46.460 --> 20:48.999
Yeah, but I fell in
love with her instantly.

20:49.006 --> 20:51.677
Even though she was your second choice.

20:52.034 --> 20:53.448
Interesting.

20:53.811 --> 20:57.189
And she fell in love with you instantly?

21:01.655 --> 21:05.153
Well, she didn't see me in
the hallway that day, but... 

21:05.853 --> 21:07.055
Now that I think about it,

21:07.061 --> 21:08.813
she didn't even say hello
to me in the hallway.

21:08.819 --> 21:10.496
She was staring at Ricky.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.329
She didn't even know who I was

21:12.323 --> 21:13.993
when I called her that
night to ask her out.

21:14.456 --> 21:18.623
But we were in love with each
other at first real sight.

21:19.430 --> 21:21.213
- I think.
- You think?

21:21.820 --> 21:24.617
Weird. I was looking at her,

21:24.830 --> 21:26.406
she was looking at Ricky.

21:26.825 --> 21:29.766
Even then. Nothing's changed.

21:30.342 --> 21:31.718
I've still been looking at her,

21:31.749 --> 21:33.563
and she's still looking at Ricky.

21:33.801 --> 21:35.990
But we were in love.

21:36.704 --> 21:37.880
I was, anyway.

21:37.855 --> 21:39.432
Or you wanted to be in love

21:39.432 --> 21:41.234
and then when you found out about the baby,

21:41.253 --> 21:45.138
it was hard to tell if you
were in love or in sympathy.

21:45.601 --> 21:47.759
I know, that's what
I've been going through.

21:48.535 --> 21:50.480
I wasn't really sure

21:50.600 --> 21:52.820
until the baby was
adopted that I loved Kathy.

21:52.827 --> 21:57.494
But I love Kathy, and Kathy loves me.

22:02.436 --> 22:04.288
What about the guy she got pregnant with?

22:04.307 --> 22:04.814
Where's he?

22:04.832 --> 22:07.141
He's not in the picture, he took a powder.

22:08.054 --> 22:09.862
And you know, when I first met her,

22:09.850 --> 22:12.759
I thought she needed me
because she didn't have him.

22:14.461 --> 22:16.638
But she didn't need either of us.

22:17.533 --> 22:19.341
That's when I knew I loved her.

22:19.335 --> 22:20.768
When you knew she didn't need you.

22:20.811 --> 22:23.175
Yeah, not good to get
those two things mixed up.

22:23.151 --> 22:25.335
It can turn into a
rescue mission, you know?

22:26.131 --> 22:27.000
You okay?

22:27.056 --> 22:27.938
Uh,

22:28.851 --> 22:30.747
for someone who just had an epiphany

22:30.766 --> 22:34.495
that his first love was
perhaps not his first love,

22:35.214 --> 22:37.780
yeah, I'm fine.

22:43.429 --> 22:45.194
Thanks for the ride.

22:45.219 --> 22:47.584
You've changed two lives for the better.

22:49.387 --> 22:51.121
Maybe even three.

22:55.047 --> 22:58.526
Well, I guess things went pretty
much like we thought they would.

22:58.532 --> 22:59.689
Hey, I'm not done yet.

22:59.689 --> 23:02.333
Oh, come on, you can't wear him down.

23:02.367 --> 23:03.869
He's not gonna change his mind.

23:03.894 --> 23:04.552
You know what?

23:05.672 --> 23:06.985
You're a grown woman.

23:07.105 --> 23:08.637
You can make your own decisions.

23:08.757 --> 23:10.638
You just made an excellent decision

23:10.626 --> 23:12.276
for yourself and for your child.

23:12.310 --> 23:13.585
You can do this.

23:14.346 --> 23:16.789
I'm gonna march out of here
and you're gonna go with me,

23:16.789 --> 23:17.909
and they're not gonna stop you.

23:17.934 --> 23:19.485
Yes, they are.

23:19.454 --> 23:22.968
Well, Ethan, I guess
it's time to say goodbye.

23:22.976 --> 23:24.321
The car is here.

23:25.222 --> 23:28.720
The car to take you to the airport.

23:32.085 --> 23:33.637
I love her.

23:34.288 --> 23:37.910
I've never loved anyone in my
life like I love your daughter.

23:38.403 --> 23:39.387
And so,

23:39.693 --> 23:42.089
if you will let her return to California

23:42.307 --> 23:45.042
to be with her friends and her grandmother,

23:45.076 --> 23:47.502
and to continue at a school
that she's done well at... 

23:48.083 --> 23:50.192
Don't end a sentence with a preposition.

23:50.837 --> 23:55.441
At which she's done well, then... 

23:56.899 --> 24:00.321
I'll make the ultimate sacrifice
to make you feel comfortable.

24:00.947 --> 24:04.475
I will agree to be castrated,
just like one of your horses.

24:04.525 --> 24:05.614
(CHUCKLES)

24:05.734 --> 24:07.191
So, just take me to your barn.

24:07.232 --> 24:08.492
Let's just get this over with.

24:08.612 --> 24:10.451
(SNORTS) (CHUCKLING)

24:10.513 --> 24:12.660
Not the reaction I was hoping for.

24:12.710 --> 24:14.556
What the hell are you talking about, son?

24:14.581 --> 24:16.088
I'm talking about, if you're afraid that

24:16.095 --> 24:17.653
she's just going to get pregnant again,

24:17.696 --> 24:19.680
and that's why you're making
her stay here with you,

24:19.730 --> 24:22.160
that's not gonna happen.
Not with me anyway.

24:22.164 --> 24:23.159
What does that mean?

24:23.209 --> 24:24.448
It's not gonna happen with anyone.

24:24.473 --> 24:25.924
That's what I meant.

24:25.937 --> 24:28.352
We know that's not going to happen.

24:28.821 --> 24:32.031
We're not insisting that Kathy stay
with us because we don't trust her.

24:32.212 --> 24:33.670
We want her here.

24:34.321 --> 24:35.529
We love her more than you do,

24:35.522 --> 24:36.636
she's our daughter.

24:37.743 --> 24:38.394
We've missed her.

24:38.432 --> 24:41.228
And we don't want her making any decision,

24:41.735 --> 24:43.956
or any more decisions,

24:44.519 --> 24:46.427
based on a guy. She's 15.

24:46.458 --> 24:48.029
It's not about a guy.

24:48.373 --> 24:51.683
Not completely about a guy.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.842
It's about me.

24:55.380 --> 24:58.309
I can't go back in time and change things.

24:58.885 --> 25:01.037
I got pregnant, I had a baby.

25:01.494 --> 25:03.777
I'm sorry I made a
stupid decision one night,

25:03.764 --> 25:06.298
but I can't take it back.

25:07.587 --> 25:10.847
And I feel like my life started again

25:10.891 --> 25:13.162
once I placed my baby with her mom and dad.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.390
Please, both of you,

25:17.428 --> 25:19.574
I don't want to come back here

25:19.931 --> 25:22.990
and put you in a position where
you have to answer awkward questions

25:23.110 --> 25:25.686
and your friends are gonna
stare at you and judge you

25:25.806 --> 25:27.970
and think you're bad parents
because I did what I did.

25:28.090 --> 25:31.105
You're the best parents in
the world and I love you.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.865
But I also love me.

25:36.121 --> 25:38.800
I've made a life for
myself out in California,

25:39.190 --> 25:41.891
and I like my life there.

25:43.228 --> 25:44.725
And I know you don't want to hear this,

25:44.725 --> 25:47.916
but I love Ethan.

25:49.134 --> 25:52.289
Please, please let me go.

25:53.402 --> 25:55.574
I feel like castrating you.

25:56.206 --> 25:57.544
I do.

26:00.245 --> 26:02.482
You're my daughter, I love you.

26:03.039 --> 26:05.960
Maybe we were wrong to send
you away in the first place.

26:06.284 --> 26:09.489
We thought it would be easier on
all of us, and it probably was,

26:09.502 --> 26:11.404
but sometimes the best thing to do

26:11.410 --> 26:13.606
is the very hardest to do.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.398
Here's something else
Tammy's parents told me.

26:24.386 --> 26:27.152
They told me that you said that
Tammy could move into your room.

26:27.164 --> 26:29.210
I told her that, but I didn't mean it.

26:29.210 --> 26:31.100
Then why did you tell her that?

26:31.512 --> 26:34.090
Oh. To get laid.

26:34.071 --> 26:35.766
- Yes.
- Tom!

26:35.886 --> 26:37.981
You lied to Tammy just to
get her to have sex with you?

26:37.987 --> 26:41.529
We just fooled around a little, that's all.

26:41.554 --> 26:43.237
No, that's not all.

26:43.243 --> 26:45.226
She's expecting to move in with you.

26:45.245 --> 26:49.161
Oh, come on! My room is
way too small for that.

26:49.142 --> 26:51.294
Did you also tell her
that you would marry her

26:51.301 --> 26:52.565
after you live with her a while?

26:52.590 --> 26:54.179
- Yes.
- Are you gonna marry her?

26:54.222 --> 26:56.062
- No.
- Then why did you tell her that?

26:56.099 --> 26:57.739
See if you can explain it, buddy.

26:57.757 --> 26:59.516
He just wanted the physical contact.

26:59.636 --> 27:01.067
The commitment was a lie.

27:01.187 --> 27:02.456
He's just like any other man.

27:02.475 --> 27:03.726
He was saying things she wanted to hear

27:03.732 --> 27:05.591
- so he could get what he wanted to get.
- Exactly.

27:05.628 --> 27:07.711
I am really disappointed in both of you.

27:07.736 --> 27:09.450
(CELL PHONE BEEPS) I'm just translating.

27:10.671 --> 27:12.636
- Do you have to go?
- He's about five minutes away,

27:12.655 --> 27:13.180
he can wait.

27:13.186 --> 27:14.181
You don't want to make him wait,

27:14.206 --> 27:16.108
you want to hear what
he has to say. So, go.

27:16.096 --> 27:17.207
All right, I'll go.

27:18.692 --> 27:20.588
Tom, it's not nice to
promise a woman something

27:20.600 --> 27:21.814
you have no intention of giving her

27:21.814 --> 27:23.202
just so you can have your way with her.

27:23.221 --> 27:25.899
She was using sex

27:26.105 --> 27:29.171
to get me to let her move in and marry her.

27:29.208 --> 27:29.897
What?

27:29.928 --> 27:32.750
She's tired of living at home.

27:32.794 --> 27:37.499
They got mad at her after
the (WHISPERS) divorce.

27:37.524 --> 27:39.921
I say he's off the hook. Good night.

27:43.396 --> 27:44.885
Hey, are you okay?

27:44.947 --> 27:46.543
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Do you want me to go with you?

27:46.561 --> 27:47.688
No. It's a man thing.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.239
You want me to come?

27:49.258 --> 27:51.308
Nah, you got your own trouble here.

27:51.848 --> 27:54.177
Okay. Call me the second he leaves.

27:58.330 --> 28:00.226
So, Tom,

28:00.414 --> 28:02.998
I think that maybe you and Tammy
should get together and talk.

28:03.041 --> 28:03.967
In my room?

28:03.980 --> 28:06.163
Tom, I'm not gonna let you use Tammy.

28:06.190 --> 28:09.404
Shouldn't that be up to her?

28:11.144 --> 28:12.621
Tom, do you love her?

28:12.741 --> 28:15.411
No, but she's a special girl.

28:15.643 --> 28:17.751
She was my first love.

28:17.801 --> 28:20.122
Yeah, well... George was my first love.

28:20.153 --> 28:24.001
Yeah, don't make too much of that.

28:30.615 --> 28:32.110
(SIGHS)

28:32.341 --> 28:34.675
So, I have to drive Jack
to the emergency room.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.033
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

28:36.026 --> 28:37.002
Nothing is wrong.

28:37.015 --> 28:38.623
He thinks his casts need to come off

28:38.635 --> 28:41.688
because he thinks all of his broken
bones have been miraculously healed.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.872
- Is that even possible?
- No.

28:43.878 --> 28:45.768
Then why are you taking
him to the emergency room?

28:45.793 --> 28:48.245
Because he thinks it's possible
and until he knows that it isn't,

28:48.220 --> 28:49.515
I'm not going to be able
to get anything done.

28:49.509 --> 28:51.186
Well, send him back to
the dorm or back home.

28:51.193 --> 28:53.364
He went back to the dorm, and then
the coach sent him to his house,

28:53.401 --> 28:55.616
and his dad called me
to see if I would mind.

28:55.816 --> 28:57.987
He doesn't want people
to think at the hospital

28:58.012 --> 29:00.797
that he thinks he's some kind of
faith healer or something, so... 

29:00.815 --> 29:03.693
Well, take your books. Emergency
rooms can be pretty crowded at night.

29:03.706 --> 29:05.170
Yeah, I know that.

29:05.290 --> 29:06.315
- Grace,
- Yeah?

29:06.321 --> 29:07.591
tell me the truth.

29:08.755 --> 29:11.383
Do you think that I got back with George

29:11.503 --> 29:14.504
because I really love him
and I've always loved him,

29:15.192 --> 29:17.438
or because he was my first real love

29:17.464 --> 29:19.553
and I already knew him,
so it made things easier?

29:19.597 --> 29:21.230
The second one.

29:21.350 --> 29:23.564
Face it, Mom. You're a lazy dater.

29:25.584 --> 29:27.561
Well, so are you!

29:30.057 --> 29:33.047
You and Anne took my son and
had a paternity test done?

29:33.053 --> 29:35.030
There's a good chance that he's my son

29:35.068 --> 29:38.208
and Anne decided she wanted
an answer as soon as possible.

29:38.328 --> 29:39.865
It's a simple swab test.

29:39.872 --> 29:40.929
It was nothing, but

29:41.110 --> 29:42.312
it could be everything.

29:42.343 --> 29:43.857
Well, even if it turns
out that you two have

29:43.845 --> 29:46.755
the same spit or genes, or whatever,

29:47.093 --> 29:47.862
that doesn't mean anything.

29:47.881 --> 29:50.251
It means that Robie is my son.

29:50.270 --> 29:51.547
No, it doesn't.

29:51.734 --> 29:54.036
Uh, biologically, and legally, it does.

29:54.068 --> 29:54.762
No, it doesn't.

29:54.781 --> 29:56.884
George, I know this is
difficult for you to grasp,

29:56.903 --> 29:59.693
but it changes everything. Or it could.

29:59.724 --> 30:00.700
No, it doesn't.

30:01.082 --> 30:03.778
It doesn't change that I
delivered him here, at this house!

30:04.023 --> 30:06.312
I've looked after Robie
every single day of his life.

30:06.349 --> 30:08.493
He doesn't live here with
you, he lives with Anne.

30:08.539 --> 30:09.359
He's here a lot.

30:09.402 --> 30:11.655
- Okay.
- He calls me "dada."

30:11.868 --> 30:13.982
- Okay.
- Don't just sit there okaying me!

30:14.102 --> 30:15.798
Robie is my son and you can't have him!

30:15.848 --> 30:17.643
I don't care what the test says.

30:18.156 --> 30:19.570
Besides, I already had a test.

30:19.595 --> 30:20.772
A paternity test?

30:20.822 --> 30:21.885
Yeah.

30:22.005 --> 30:23.988
- What?
- I had a test done way back when.

30:24.001 --> 30:25.515
- And?
- And nothing.

30:25.635 --> 30:28.311
You weren't around, so
he's my son by default.

30:28.324 --> 30:31.608
You mean to tell me you've known
all along that Robie is my son?

30:31.583 --> 30:33.266
You left. I stayed!

30:33.441 --> 30:35.699
I stayed with a gay woman,
that's what a good dad I am.

30:35.706 --> 30:36.744
Anne is going to kill you!

30:36.769 --> 30:38.308
For what? For doing the
right thing when you wouldn't?

30:38.327 --> 30:40.161
Never mind, I'm going to kill you!

30:40.281 --> 30:42.188
Why the hell didn't
you find me and tell me?

30:42.195 --> 30:43.089
I didn't want to find you.

30:43.114 --> 30:44.722
I think there might be a law against this.

30:44.741 --> 30:46.593
Oh, no, there isn't. I wasn't
pretending to be the father,

30:46.593 --> 30:47.769
I am the father.

30:47.775 --> 30:49.733
You just said I was the father.

30:50.778 --> 30:53.237
I'm the father? I'm the father! Oh, my God.

30:53.237 --> 30:55.114
Oh, no, don't go getting all excited

30:55.139 --> 30:56.159
because you haven't been the father

30:56.203 --> 30:57.404
and you're not going to be the father.

30:57.417 --> 30:59.982
Look, George, you can
still be in Robie's life.

30:59.988 --> 31:02.603
I'm sure you'll always
be in his life, I guess.

31:02.616 --> 31:04.180
Hell, yeah! I'll be in his life.

31:05.043 --> 31:06.520
You know, better think about this.

31:06.576 --> 31:08.497
This is going to upset
the entire ecosystem.

31:08.685 --> 31:10.249
Our family, your family.

31:10.286 --> 31:11.888
You think your wife is
going to be happy about this?

31:11.926 --> 31:14.291
I have a son! Oh, my God! I have a son!

31:14.411 --> 31:16.668
And my wife knows what's going on.

31:16.668 --> 31:18.364
She knew I was getting tested,

31:18.351 --> 31:20.284
and that Robie was getting tested, too.

31:20.628 --> 31:23.187
She knew that I was going
to talk to Anne and then you.

31:23.255 --> 31:28.161
She's accepted the possibility,
but geez, this is a reality.

31:28.179 --> 31:29.649
What kind of wife is that,
that just accepts that

31:29.649 --> 31:31.075
you have children outside of your marriage?

31:31.107 --> 31:32.695
It was before we got married,

31:32.714 --> 31:35.242
and Anne's gay, so she's
no threat to my wife.

31:36.474 --> 31:38.433
Look, George, I got to go.

31:38.553 --> 31:41.798
But we'll work something out where you're

31:41.999 --> 31:43.212
allowed to see Robie,

31:43.225 --> 31:44.620
at least in the transition.

31:44.651 --> 31:46.897
Allowed? Allowed to see my own son?

31:46.891 --> 31:48.805
Stop saying that, it's not true!

31:48.818 --> 31:51.833
You told me it's not true.
He's not your son. He's my son.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.742
You want to call Anne or
you want me to call Anne?

31:54.767 --> 31:57.000
Why does anyone have to call
Anne? We know who the mother is!

31:57.032 --> 31:58.521
Good night.

32:06.192 --> 32:07.530
Damn it.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.208
- Did we get you on the waiting list?
- Yep.

32:16.633 --> 32:19.206
Aren't you the guy that got
beat up by that no good pimp?

32:19.187 --> 32:20.945
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'm going to get you right in.

32:20.945 --> 32:22.319
- And what's going on?
- Are you in pain?

32:22.322 --> 32:23.911
- No, ma'am. I'm not.
- Oh.

32:24.549 --> 32:26.745
- Okay.
- He thinks he's had a miraculous healing.

32:26.770 --> 32:27.790
Oh.

32:27.910 --> 32:29.578
I just need to get these casts off.

32:29.613 --> 32:31.088
Have you been taking a lot of pain meds?

32:31.208 --> 32:32.434
Nope. None.

32:32.446 --> 32:33.673
All righty.

32:34.148 --> 32:36.669
Well, let me get to work on this.

32:38.278 --> 32:40.337
Grace, I think I've chosen my major.

32:40.405 --> 32:42.000
Hmm, that's nice.

32:42.019 --> 32:44.040
- I've been called.
- Hmm?

32:44.160 --> 32:45.594
The Lord has spoken to me.

32:45.629 --> 32:47.475
Through the miracle of the bones?

32:48.170 --> 32:50.091
I'm gonna become a minister.

32:50.372 --> 32:52.262
That's what I want to do
with the rest of my life.

32:52.312 --> 32:53.294
I'll tell you what.

32:53.870 --> 32:55.622
If your bones are completely healed

32:55.639 --> 32:58.507
like you think they are,
then I think you should do it.

32:58.541 --> 33:01.310
And if they're not, I
think you should reconsider.

33:01.344 --> 33:02.344
(SIGHS)

33:07.764 --> 33:09.618
Hi. How'd it go?

33:09.653 --> 33:11.744
It went well. It was just
what I needed. Thanks.

33:12.150 --> 33:13.289
Hungry?

33:13.345 --> 33:14.640
You're just now eating dinner?

33:14.703 --> 33:16.686
Yeah, but I brought plenty for you. Taco?

33:16.705 --> 33:18.369
- You know I cooked.
- Taco?

33:18.428 --> 33:21.447
Stop it! It was good. I made something new.

33:21.741 --> 33:23.656
- Miso soup and edamame.
- Taco.

33:23.662 --> 33:26.334
No! But I'll take one of those
apple things if you have it.

33:26.454 --> 33:28.367
- I have it.
- Yes!

33:28.930 --> 33:30.306
Mmm.

33:32.816 --> 33:35.749
So, what'd you talk about? Me?

33:36.262 --> 33:38.746
You and me and life,

33:38.866 --> 33:40.823
the universe, everything.

33:40.873 --> 33:41.793
But mostly me.

33:41.824 --> 33:42.807
Mostly me.

33:42.838 --> 33:44.627
Did you tell him that
we're not really married?

33:44.633 --> 33:47.023
These tacos are great.

33:48.243 --> 33:52.041
Yeah. I told him, but
he's not gonna tell anyone.

33:52.367 --> 33:54.888
I wish you'd talk to me about
whatever it is you talked to him about.

33:54.926 --> 33:58.166
No, it takes an hour of
saying random meaningless stuff

33:58.173 --> 34:00.199
and dumping out all the junk in your brain

34:00.225 --> 34:02.758
before you get around to finding
out what you really want to say.

34:02.815 --> 34:05.060
- You should try it sometime.
- Maybe I will.

34:05.275 --> 34:07.688
And what is it that you
really want to say, Ricky?

34:07.694 --> 34:08.877
That I love you.

34:09.289 --> 34:10.897
That's what it all came down to.

34:11.581 --> 34:13.949
I love you and I want to be married to you,

34:14.319 --> 34:16.128
and have a wonderful
life with you and John.

34:16.248 --> 34:18.005
- Oh. (SIGHS)
- Oh.

34:19.763 --> 34:20.952
What did you do when I was gone?

34:20.996 --> 34:25.944
Well, I had some time, so
I took a long, hot bath,

34:26.820 --> 34:30.159
and got all rested so that I
could spend some time with you.

34:30.600 --> 34:31.600
Really?

34:31.634 --> 34:33.001
Really.

34:45.748 --> 34:47.121
Happy?

34:47.760 --> 34:49.155
I've never been happier.

34:49.179 --> 34:50.237
You want to call your parents?

34:50.199 --> 34:52.721
- Why spoil it?
- Come on, they're gonna be happy.

34:53.866 --> 34:55.618
All right, look, let's just... 

34:55.880 --> 34:57.763
Let's just wait and show them together.

34:57.883 --> 34:59.528
But we can call your parents if you want.

34:59.547 --> 35:00.404
My parents already know.

35:00.524 --> 35:01.912
I had to get the ring from them.

35:01.924 --> 35:02.975
They don't know that I said yes.

35:02.975 --> 35:04.827
I texted them when you
were getting undressed.

35:04.858 --> 35:05.697
No, you didn't!

35:05.703 --> 35:07.818
I figured it was my last chance.

35:08.011 --> 35:09.995
Okay, look, let's talk about this.

35:10.251 --> 35:12.216
No children before I get out of college.

35:12.241 --> 35:13.310
Absolutely not.

35:13.335 --> 35:15.182
I think we should wait
until you get out of college

35:15.207 --> 35:17.115
and we have a couple of years
to travel around together.

35:17.422 --> 35:20.080
And how are we going to afford to take

35:20.105 --> 35:21.994
a couple of years to
travel around together?

35:22.401 --> 35:23.834
I'm going to be getting into family law

35:23.852 --> 35:25.029
and you're going to be a teacher.

35:25.235 --> 35:26.505
I think we're doing road trips.

35:26.562 --> 35:28.082
You know the job interview today?

35:28.320 --> 35:29.196
Yeah.

35:29.316 --> 35:30.378
I got the job.

35:30.422 --> 35:32.837
Well, it's not exactly a job.

35:32.957 --> 35:35.227
They bought my idea and
they're going to let me make it,

35:35.290 --> 35:37.429
and, well,

35:37.549 --> 35:39.144
I think you and I are gonna be okay.

35:39.125 --> 35:40.163
What was your idea?

35:40.188 --> 35:42.716
I want to put education on film.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.405
Kindergarten through high school.

35:44.424 --> 35:46.126
Get the best teachers in the country,

35:46.107 --> 35:48.066
follow them through their
lesson plan for the year,

35:48.128 --> 35:50.043
and then, boom, it's all on DVD.

35:50.163 --> 35:54.041
Hopefully, it'll run free on educational
stations or you can just buy the set,

35:54.161 --> 35:55.917
and people who never had
a chance to go to school

35:55.942 --> 35:57.143
could get an education,

35:57.212 --> 35:58.820
or people who are
home-schooling their kids

35:58.855 --> 36:00.856
can get help from the
best teachers in America.

36:00.890 --> 36:03.218
Or, if you just need
help with your homework,

36:03.249 --> 36:04.507
there it is on DVD.

36:04.501 --> 36:05.502
Wow!

36:05.908 --> 36:07.779
Omar, that's a great idea!

36:07.785 --> 36:09.644
I've been thinking about it for years.

36:09.675 --> 36:11.170
I put together a proposal

36:11.208 --> 36:16.188
and asked for a meeting and I
got a check for a million dollars.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.254
And that doesn't cover my
salary which I'll be getting,

36:19.273 --> 36:20.843
or the royalties on the project.

36:20.877 --> 36:23.258
I wasn't even looking
to make money from this,

36:23.308 --> 36:25.417
it was just something I thought
would be a good thing to do.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.143
I knew you were brilliant.

36:28.920 --> 36:32.687
You know, it might be really
good in third world countries.

36:32.693 --> 36:33.851
I know.

36:34.251 --> 36:37.048
Of course, this is good anywhere.

36:37.098 --> 36:38.475
Mmm-hmm.

36:42.065 --> 36:45.932
Hey, look who's sitting in the den
waiting to hear how my night went.

36:46.138 --> 36:47.289
How'd it go?

36:47.409 --> 36:49.267
Why on Earth would you
set me up with a woman

36:49.261 --> 36:50.481
that you think is no good for me?

36:50.512 --> 36:52.701
I thought about it and
I know you're lonely,

36:52.739 --> 36:55.473
and I know despite all the
trouble you two got into,

36:55.899 --> 36:57.560
that you have feelings for Dylan.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.515
And someone, like my new little sister,

36:59.534 --> 37:02.518
told you that Amy Juergens isn't
really married and you panicked.

37:02.552 --> 37:03.764
Have I ever panicked?

37:03.884 --> 37:05.878
- I don't know, but... 
- But how was your night?

37:05.916 --> 37:08.731
My night was good, but
my day was even better.

37:08.731 --> 37:11.353
Yeah, I heard you drove
the kid to the airport.

37:11.365 --> 37:13.768
And on that drive, I realized

37:14.287 --> 37:17.610
perhaps Amy's pregnancy
had more than a little to do

37:17.666 --> 37:19.468
with what I felt for her,

37:20.288 --> 37:22.364
and maybe I've just
always wanted to feel that

37:22.370 --> 37:24.391
someone needed me the way she did,

37:24.710 --> 37:28.552
so I could be strong for someone
and feel important because,

37:28.733 --> 37:32.688
well, my dad is a very strong and

37:32.707 --> 37:33.670
very important man.

37:33.695 --> 37:35.065
You grew up on the way to the airport?

37:35.121 --> 37:36.635
(CHUCKLES) I might have.

37:36.617 --> 37:38.587
So if I had just waited one more day... 

37:38.612 --> 37:41.040
I think I might have circled
back around to Dylan anyway.

37:41.102 --> 37:42.203
I like her.

37:42.247 --> 37:43.986
I'm not sure that I'm in love with her,

37:44.011 --> 37:46.057
but I don't think there's anything
wrong with falling in love over time

37:46.088 --> 37:47.396
falling in love over time

37:47.371 --> 37:49.573
as opposed to love at first sight.

37:49.861 --> 37:51.913
I see how happy you and Camille are,

37:51.963 --> 37:53.577
and how well suited you are for each other.

37:53.602 --> 37:55.848
Who is this guy? I like this guy.

37:55.898 --> 37:57.663
- Good night, Dad.
- Night, son.

37:57.707 --> 37:58.877
I love you.

37:59.209 --> 38:01.361
And tonight, I mean it.

38:01.430 --> 38:02.578
Love you, too.

38:09.886 --> 38:11.553
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

38:16.396 --> 38:17.778
Hello?

38:26.595 --> 38:28.565
It's okay,

38:28.685 --> 38:30.811
we can just cuddle.

38:31.756 --> 38:32.638
Yeah.

38:32.857 --> 38:35.379
Oh, it happens.

38:35.499 --> 38:37.387
You have a lot on your mind.

38:38.201 --> 38:39.483
Yeah.

38:40.021 --> 38:41.716
And Tom is across the hall,

38:41.716 --> 38:44.006
the timing just wasn't right.

38:44.126 --> 38:46.586
I swear this isn't our future.

38:47.298 --> 38:49.156
It's okay, George.

38:50.851 --> 38:52.491
I love you.

38:54.699 --> 38:56.101
I don't know why.

39:05.092 --> 39:06.850
Jack, there you are! How are you doing?

39:06.912 --> 39:08.214
Are you ready for me?

39:09.221 --> 39:11.793
Uh, your orthopedic surgeon
is still in emergency surgery,

39:11.849 --> 39:14.651
but I talked to him and he said that

39:14.771 --> 39:17.417
he saw you just last week and that
you're making very good progress.

39:17.537 --> 39:18.236
I know.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.632
But... 

39:19.663 --> 39:22.491
the casts aren't coming
off for a few more weeks.

39:22.710 --> 39:25.945
I'm sure you're ready for
them to come off right now,

39:26.233 --> 39:27.491
looks very uncomfortable.

39:27.516 --> 39:29.074
Are you taking your pain meds?

39:29.080 --> 39:32.521
I don't need to take my pain
meds, my bones are healed.

39:33.309 --> 39:36.900
Jack, I want you to
give me a call tomorrow,

39:36.919 --> 39:39.178
after you've had time to get some rest,

39:39.209 --> 39:40.479
and... 

39:40.942 --> 39:42.538
come in and see me.

39:42.951 --> 39:45.085
Let's talk about what happened to you,

39:45.110 --> 39:46.361
what you've been through.

39:46.761 --> 39:49.408
I'm sure it's been really difficult.

39:49.765 --> 39:51.316
I heard about the attack

39:51.798 --> 39:53.812
and I know your doctors have suggested

39:53.837 --> 39:55.795
that you get some counseling,

39:55.820 --> 39:58.141
but you haven't been open to it.

39:58.867 --> 40:00.294
But would you come in and talk to me?

40:00.288 --> 40:02.728
About what? I don't need a
psychiatrist, I just need a saw.

40:02.778 --> 40:04.480
Do yourself a favor, don't try to take

40:04.486 --> 40:05.993
that cast off yourself, all right?

40:06.744 --> 40:08.790
And this young lady?

40:11.806 --> 40:13.445
Hello.

40:14.796 --> 40:17.130
Hey. I know you.

40:17.173 --> 40:18.674
Grace Bowman! From med camp.

40:18.956 --> 40:20.958
- Yeah.
- Of course! How are you?

40:21.078 --> 40:23.579
Dr. Chan. Missed you last summer.

40:23.605 --> 40:26.570
Wait. As I recall, you are a bit

40:27.284 --> 40:28.122
religious yourself.

40:28.135 --> 40:29.117
Did you suggest that... 

40:29.155 --> 40:30.456
No. No, I did not.

40:30.576 --> 40:33.103
I think the bones will heal on their own.

40:33.284 --> 40:36.606
I just gave Jack a ride over
here because he insisted.

40:37.063 --> 40:38.646
Jack, are you getting any sleep?

40:38.766 --> 40:40.054
Yeah, I've been getting plenty of sleep.

40:40.079 --> 40:41.900
I could sleep better
if this was off, but... 

40:41.900 --> 40:44.552
But come and see me tomorrow.

40:46.029 --> 40:47.418
Good to see you, Grace.

40:50.258 --> 40:52.761
He doesn't know anything
about bones or God.

40:52.761 --> 40:54.087
He's a psychiatrist.

40:54.957 --> 40:56.227
Let's go.

40:59.887 --> 41:01.607
(LAUGHING)

41:01.923 --> 41:04.198
Oh, I am so happy to see you!

41:04.318 --> 41:06.375
I was going to be so lonely without you.

41:06.419 --> 41:08.478
They're just letting me stay
until the end of the school year.

41:08.503 --> 41:10.511
"Then we'll see." That's what they said.

41:10.561 --> 41:13.333
I'm surprised that you
returned all in one piece.

41:13.453 --> 41:15.329
- He almost didn't.
- Oh, come on,

41:15.449 --> 41:17.205
was there ever really any question that

41:17.168 --> 41:18.338
weren't coming back here together?

41:18.344 --> 41:19.806
- Yes.
- Yes.

41:23.218 --> 41:25.612
Say goodnight and get out of here.

41:27.960 --> 41:30.488
You know, just because you got me back here

41:30.494 --> 41:32.177
doesn't mean I owe you anything,

41:32.227 --> 41:33.942
like sex or anything.

41:33.967 --> 41:36.844
- Who asked you?
- I just don't want any misunderstandings.

41:36.857 --> 41:38.990
But thank you.

41:39.046 --> 41:40.016
You're welcome.

41:46.173 --> 41:47.130
I love you.

41:47.324 --> 41:49.225
- I love you, too.
- You think it'll last?

41:49.200 --> 41:53.073
Oh, come on. Don't spoil our
goodbye by planting any doubts.

41:53.073 --> 41:55.026
So, you don't have any doubt?

41:55.044 --> 41:57.477
No. You're the guy for me.
