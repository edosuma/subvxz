WEBVTT

00:05.792 --> 00:07.959
Hey, Pops. I got the money.

00:08.041 --> 00:09.709
I just left it up in my room.

00:09.792 --> 00:10.959
I'll fetch it.

00:11.041 --> 00:13.375
Let me grab a tallboy
for the journey.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.917
- No deal.
- You know I'm good for it.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.250
That's not the point.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.375
You can barely stay
upright as it is.

00:19.458 --> 00:21.208
What you care?
Long as you get
paid.

00:21.291 --> 00:22.917
Oh, Landry, come on.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.417
What kind of man would I be..

00:24.500 --> 00:26.166
...if I let one of my
loyal customers go out

00:26.250 --> 00:28.542
in the dead of winter
with a half a load on?

00:28.625 --> 00:30.583
I take full responsibility.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.041
It's not happening.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.250
I tell you what.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.917
I'll spot you a cup
of coffee for the road.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.750
You can give me
the two bits in the a.m.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.291
You're welcome.

00:55.333 --> 00:58.000
Landry, I done told you,
I'm not serving you tonight.

01:07.875 --> 01:09.458
Don't even think about it.

01:09.542 --> 01:11.959
Oh, come on.
How about some talk radio?

01:12.041 --> 01:14.000
Sports, politics.
Anything but this.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.625
Now, you're talking
about the Temptations.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.542
And it's freaking depressing.

01:17.625 --> 01:18.917
Somebody always
crying about
losing

01:19.000 --> 01:20.500
their girl or their house.

01:20.583 --> 01:22.291
I don't need to hear it.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.875
I'm living it.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.291
You got no culture.

01:26.375 --> 01:28.333
If I admit it,
will you turn it off?

01:28.417 --> 01:30.291
[scoffs]
No.

01:32.583 --> 01:35.000
- What now?
- Out of milk.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.000
(Nick)
'We'll get some in the
morning.
We just worked a double.'

01:37.083 --> 01:38.583
Well, you should have
considered that before
you

01:38.667 --> 01:40.875
finished off
the last half
gallon.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.041
Anyone here?

01:53.333 --> 01:54.333
Hello?

02:06.625 --> 02:07.625
Will.

02:07.709 --> 02:08.834
'Will!'

02:10.875 --> 02:12.625
Will!

02:12.709 --> 02:14.625
Where the hell are you?

02:28.959 --> 02:32.000
This is Detective Vera.
Officer down. Officer down!

02:32.083 --> 02:34.083
'Grocery store, Fifth and Main.'

02:34.166 --> 02:36.125
'I need rescue!'

02:48.291 --> 02:49.250
Rush.

02:49.333 --> 02:50.458
Sweetheart.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.750
Wake up, angel.

02:52.834 --> 02:55.500
Come on, baby.
Wake up. Come on.

02:55.583 --> 02:58.375
We're going to grandma's,
okay? I got to work
tonight.

03:00.625 --> 03:01.792
It's close enough to your place?

03:01.875 --> 03:04.166
- 'Sure.'
- Sorry, I can't walk you.

03:05.917 --> 03:08.000
Well, maybe we
can do this again.

03:13.125 --> 03:16.333
BP is 50/33. Respiratory
distress. Prep for
intubation.'

03:16.417 --> 03:18.000
Anything I need to
know about this patient?

03:18.083 --> 03:20.250
Allergies, medical
conditions, prescriptions?

03:20.333 --> 03:21.542
(Nick)
I-I don't, I can find out.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.000
- No time.
- Is he going to be okay?

03:24.083 --> 03:25.834
Nick.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.709
I drank all the damn milk.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.291
(male #1)
'I spoke to the paramedics.
Two victims.'

04:11.375 --> 04:13.208
Store owner, Henry Walters.
Goes by Pops.

04:13.291 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, the other one's a
cop.
What's their condition?

04:15.083 --> 04:17.458
Multiple gunshot
wounds.
Taken to Saint Paul's.

04:17.542 --> 04:19.500
- One expired on the table.
- Which one?

04:19.583 --> 04:20.750
- 'Um..'
- The cop or the owner?

04:20.834 --> 04:23.000
- Uh..
- Come on.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.458
Uh, Walters. It was
definitely Walters.

04:25.542 --> 04:26.834
What about Jeffries?

04:26.917 --> 04:28.333
- The cop.
- Um..

04:30.417 --> 04:33.083
(male #2)
'Pete McGinley. Call comes in.
I'm first on the scene.'

04:33.166 --> 04:34.834
- What did you see?
- Not much.

04:34.917 --> 04:36.166
Detective shot on the floor.

04:36.250 --> 04:37.834
- His partner, big guy.
- Vera?

04:37.917 --> 04:39.250
Yeah. Points me out the back.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.083
I made chase, but the shooter
is in the wind.

04:41.166 --> 04:42.667
- Robbery?
- This area?

04:42.750 --> 04:45.208
Robbery, drug deal,
gang retribution.

04:45.291 --> 04:46.375
Your guy walks in.

04:46.458 --> 04:47.917
- Wrong place, wrong time.
- Yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.417
- Witnesses?
- Deaf, dumb and blind.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.583
I need details!
You saw something.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.542
'Heard something.
Know something.'

04:55.625 --> 04:56.959
Step up now.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.875
Oh, this is funny to you?

04:59.959 --> 05:01.250
Cop got shot, jag-off.

05:01.333 --> 05:02.917
Toss him in the wagon.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.125
You worried about
being a snitch?

05:05.208 --> 05:07.041
That crap ends here.

05:07.125 --> 05:09.375
Or we'll water board
your ass if we got to.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.625
We're going to find
out what happened.

05:11.709 --> 05:13.083
Hey. Hey, hey, you.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.583
Easy, easy

05:15.625 --> 05:16.542
What's your name?

05:16.625 --> 05:19.333
Landry. I ain't seen nothing.

05:19.417 --> 05:20.750
You know the
store,
right, Landry?

05:20.834 --> 05:23.125
Pops was real good to me.

05:23.208 --> 05:26.166
He had a special place
in his heart for screw-ups.

05:26.250 --> 05:27.625
You been drinking
tonight, Landry?

05:27.709 --> 05:29.166
I don't see why
tonight would be

05:29.250 --> 05:30.959
different than any other.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.709
I likes my beer.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.583
How's about a case?

05:34.667 --> 05:36.917
I heard a gun go off.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.083
One shot.
Then two more.

05:39.166 --> 05:42.208
How long between the shots?
Was it bang, then bang,
bang?

05:42.291 --> 05:46.417
I was crossing the street
when I heard the first shot.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.917
When the others came..

05:48.000 --> 05:50.834
...I was like a whole
another block away.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.792
Hey, you'll get your cash
back at the station. Come
on.

05:54.875 --> 05:57.375
[whistles]
Him too.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.667
Detective Jeffries' family?

06:02.750 --> 06:04.792
Haven't been able
to reach his sister, so..

06:04.875 --> 06:07.041
- How is he?
- He was shot twice in the
back.

06:07.125 --> 06:08.667
One bullet
lodged
in the ribcage.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.291
- How bad?
- 'Missed his vital organs.'

06:10.375 --> 06:12.166
- Removed it without
incident.
- The other bullet?

06:12.250 --> 06:14.166
(female #1)
'Punctured a lung,
which collapsed.'

06:14.250 --> 06:15.583
'As soon as he's
stabilized, we'll get him'

06:15.667 --> 06:17.291
out of trauma
and move him to surgery.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.458
What's it looking like?

06:20.333 --> 06:21.625
A long night.

06:25.333 --> 06:27.250
Put me on the street, boss.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.959
Let me find the scumbag
who shot Will.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.667
Ah, you're in no
condition, Nick.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.959
I'm telling you..

06:35.041 --> 06:36.834
...all the training..

06:36.917 --> 06:39.333
...nothing can prepare you
for when it all goes down.

06:39.417 --> 06:42.291
This is Detective Vera.
Officer down. Officer down!

06:42.375 --> 06:45.458
Grocery store,
Fifth and Main. I need rescue!

06:45.542 --> 06:47.125
Hold on, buddy. Hold on.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.291
Got to apply
pressure to that wound.

06:49.375 --> 06:50.709
Police! Who's there?

06:54.875 --> 06:56.542
I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

06:56.625 --> 06:57.625
Someone went out the back.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.041
Just one?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.834
I-I don't know.

07:01.917 --> 07:03.458
You hold on, buddy, okay?

07:03.542 --> 07:04.917
You hold on. I'm here. I'm here.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.333
I'm going to apply
pressure
to this wound, okay?

07:06.417 --> 07:07.709
'You hold on!'

07:07.792 --> 07:10.291
Cop must have been a block
away when the call came in.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.083
Did you get a
look
at the shooter?

07:12.166 --> 07:13.709
What about before
you went in the
store?

07:13.792 --> 07:15.125
You notice anyone?

07:15.208 --> 07:18.250
You hear anything?
The first gunshot
maybe?

07:18.333 --> 07:19.542
Nothing.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.458
So, he was in the
store
when you pulled up.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.125
Pops was already shot.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.583
What was he doing in there?

07:26.667 --> 07:29.500
He wasn't robbing the place.
Cash in the till.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.834
Pops' watch and wallet

07:30.917 --> 07:32.458
were on him when he
reached the hospital.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.792
Maybe the shooter was
looking for something else.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.500
'Three shell casings.
Nine-millimeter.'

07:38.583 --> 07:41.917
Will comes in.
Goes for the milk.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.542
Shooter jumps up.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.000
Opens fire.

07:56.792 --> 07:59.166
Bloody footprints say
the doer runs out the back.

07:59.250 --> 08:02.500
'Cause Vera's
coming in the
front.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.417
He kicks open the back door..

08:04.500 --> 08:06.667
'...takes off down the alley.'

08:06.750 --> 08:08.417
Got video surveillance up front.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.417
It's back here too.

08:22.041 --> 08:25.000
Tapes haven't been
touched in years.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.083
Here's hoping they still play.

08:30.792 --> 08:32.083
I've met this girl.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.750
Valentine's out
there somewhere.

08:35.834 --> 08:38.250
- Who knows what he'll do?
- What happened, Carmen?

08:38.333 --> 08:40.125
They had some
kind of
argument.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.208
I've never seen
Pops so angry.

08:42.291 --> 08:44.542
You know the old man.
He don't back down for
nothing.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.250
Neither does Valentine.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.291
You should have seen
the look in his eyes.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.583
Okay. Don't worry
about it, sweetheart.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.834
I'll take care
of it. Okay?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.500
We just found
Pops' next of kin.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.375
So, Carmen comes to Will..

09:04.458 --> 09:06.667
...'cause she's
worried
about this
Valentine.

09:08.208 --> 09:10.750
Will was here for
a whole lot more than milk.

09:14.834 --> 09:16.792
Wait, what kind of gun?

09:16.875 --> 09:19.083
No, no, look, tell your
snitch we're looking for, uh

09:19.166 --> 09:21.250
a nine-millimeter.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.792
Yep.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.166
Any news?

09:25.166 --> 09:26.750
They moved him up to surgery.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.834
Need, uh, blood?
Something like that?

09:28.917 --> 09:30.458
No. They're good, Scotty.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.792
You okay?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.834
Sorry. Tip line's overwhelmed.

09:36.917 --> 09:39.166
Some schmuck gives
my number instead.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.125
What do you got?

09:40.208 --> 09:41.166
Putting the screws to known

09:41.250 --> 09:42.542
stick-up men, local dealers

09:42.625 --> 09:45.000
bangers,
but...it's
looking like Will
was

09:45.083 --> 09:46.333
in the store for a reason.

09:46.417 --> 09:47.917
He knew Pops?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.875
There might have been
some kind of falling out

09:49.959 --> 09:53.291
between Pops and a guy who
goes by the name Valentine.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.709
What kind of falling out?

09:54.792 --> 09:56.333
I'm hoping Pops' grand daughter

09:56.417 --> 09:57.834
Carmen can fill in the blanks.

09:57.917 --> 09:59.667
Neighbor said she's
a student over at
Temple.

09:59.750 --> 10:00.959
Miller's bringing her in.

10:01.041 --> 10:02.333
You checking the
system
for Valentine?

10:02.417 --> 10:03.500
Wait a minute, that name.

10:04.625 --> 10:08.000
No, Detective
Jeffries
is not here.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.000
What time's the kid
getting arraigned?

10:10.083 --> 10:12.667
Yeah. "Valentine?" Got it.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.417
I'll make sure he gets it.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.083
Cop on the other line said

10:17.166 --> 10:19.125
Valentine was up
on a gun charge.

10:19.208 --> 10:21.709
But he was holding off on
filing
till Jeffries called him back.

10:21.792 --> 10:23.792
Would this connect to a case?

10:23.875 --> 10:25.166
Not that I know of.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.417
Maybe he's got
a phone number

10:26.500 --> 10:28.959
for Valentine in his things.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.458
He win a bet or something?

10:34.542 --> 10:36.709
Will never carries
more than a couple bucks.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.709
- No Valentine in here.
- We get a description at
least?

10:41.792 --> 10:43.250
'I mean, that cop,
that first responder'

10:43.333 --> 10:45.250
he get a look at the doer
when he went after him?

10:45.333 --> 10:47.041
McGinley? No.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.041
- Pete McGinley?
- 'Yeah. You know him, boss?'

10:49.125 --> 10:51.291
He went to PPD
to sort out
witnesses.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.417
(male #3)
'Colleague of mine
works the felony unit.'

10:55.500 --> 10:57.583
Said he was preparing a
complaint for a James
Valentine

10:57.667 --> 10:59.875
on handgun possession
a couple months ago.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.375
Oh, what happened?

11:01.458 --> 11:02.875
He's on his way to court,
gets a call from

11:02.959 --> 11:06.208
the arresting officer
saying he made a mistake.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.583
Your buddy get
the officer's name?

11:07.667 --> 11:10.083
Yeah. Kendrick.
Works the Fifth
District.

11:10.166 --> 11:12.375
I need you to find an Officer
Kendrick at the Fifth
District.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.500
I don't care where he
is.
Get him down here.

11:15.583 --> 11:17.000
This James
Valentine
got a record?

11:17.083 --> 11:19.291
No. Nothing recent.
All juvenile.

11:19.375 --> 11:23.041
- Records are sealed.
- Yeah. Not anymore.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.667
How'd you get these
unsealed
at three in the morning?

11:25.750 --> 11:28.917
Uh, you, uh, you
really want to know?

11:30.083 --> 11:33.333
Assault, robbery, shoplifting.

11:33.417 --> 11:36.834
Valentine was 17 last time
he was in front of a judge.

11:36.917 --> 11:37.875
He got a choice.

11:37.959 --> 11:39.667
Hard prison time..

11:39.750 --> 11:41.583
...or military service.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.041
He chose Uncle Sam.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.709
Since then he's
stayed out of
trouble.

11:44.792 --> 11:47.834
(Lilly)
Until now. Moving in?

11:47.917 --> 11:50.875
I stay until we charge
someone for shooting a cop.

11:52.917 --> 11:54.417
Your dad.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.250
Appreciate it.

12:04.834 --> 12:06.125
Excuse me.

12:13.291 --> 12:15.458
Scotty.

12:15.542 --> 12:18.083
I'm sorry about Jeffries.

12:18.166 --> 12:20.000
'Is he going to be okay?'

12:20.083 --> 12:22.041
It's too soon to tell.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.625
If you want to talk--

12:26.709 --> 12:27.792
Did you get
anything
off the security
video

12:27.875 --> 12:29.917
from Pops' store?

12:32.291 --> 12:34.959
Tape from the front
door is useless.

12:35.041 --> 12:37.083
The one from the back
is deteriorated.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.709
Thinking binder breakdown.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.375
Some TLC, I might
be able to rescue it.

12:43.041 --> 12:44.875
TLC is your specialty, ain't it?

12:51.375 --> 12:54.000
It's not so funny now, huh?

12:54.083 --> 12:56.500
Scotty, what's up?

12:56.583 --> 12:58.041
No, I just, you know, Will.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.667
- He's still in surgery?
- Yeah.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.083
You heading over there?

13:01.166 --> 13:02.917
Uh, maybe later.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.166
I just spoke to
the cop who arrested

13:04.250 --> 13:05.625
Valentine for
gun possession.

13:05.709 --> 13:07.208
Couple of months back,
Valentine gets pulled over

13:07.291 --> 13:10.166
for running a light.
.38 in the glove box.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.417
We got an address for him?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.291
I broke down the
door.
No one home.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.166
But, uh, left a small army
to bring him in if he shows
up.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.583
How's Jeffries figure in?

13:17.667 --> 13:19.959
Well, he asked
Kendrick
for a personal favor.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.709
Uh, letting
Valentine
off the hook.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.875
Oh, Will's not the type
to bend the rules.

13:24.959 --> 13:26.875
He won't even take
a free cup of coffee.

13:26.959 --> 13:29.333
Makes you wonder what
Valentine means to
him.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.291
Follow me.

13:37.709 --> 13:40.125
Valens tells me
you been a help.

13:40.208 --> 13:42.000
Doing what I can.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.959
- Where do you live, McGinley?
- Gray's Ferry.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.208
That's a long way
from Pops' store.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.834
Happy accident
you being so
close

13:48.917 --> 13:50.041
when the
shooting
went down?

13:50.125 --> 13:51.375
My night off.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.583
I can't sleep.
I like to drive.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.083
Make a habit of driving
an unmarked city vehicle

13:57.166 --> 13:59.792
with a police radio into
the ghetto on your night
off?

14:00.834 --> 14:02.959
I know two things
about you,
McGinley.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.000
'One, when you were
in uniform you were'

14:05.083 --> 14:08.333
Deputy Commissioner
Doherty's driver.

14:08.417 --> 14:10.750
And two, when
you made detective

14:10.834 --> 14:13.375
he had you
transferred
to Internal Affairs.

14:13.458 --> 14:16.291
But what I don't know is
what the hell you were
doing

14:16.375 --> 14:18.542
following one of
my detectives
around.

14:20.834 --> 14:22.750
A couple of months ago, Jeffries

14:22.834 --> 14:25.166
fixed a gun charge
on a convicted felon.

14:25.250 --> 14:26.417
If he did, he had his reasons.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.542
Yeah, and I know what they were.

14:44.542 --> 14:47.250
- You got no idea what you
saw.
- Come on, lieutenant.

14:48.709 --> 14:50.166
He gets Valentine out of a jam.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.709
A few weeks later,
he's collecting his bonus.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.583
'Probably got him shot.'

14:54.667 --> 14:56.750
Get out of here.
Go back to
Doherty.

14:56.834 --> 14:59.417
I'm a cop first. I want to help.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.125
You're not welcome here.

15:05.834 --> 15:08.625
(Carmen)
Pops' would bring
in the troubled kids.

15:08.709 --> 15:10.875
Ones who put up
the biggest front.

15:10.959 --> 15:14.000
Give 'em a job.
Try to school 'em.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.959
You know where
Valentine is now,
Carmen?

15:16.041 --> 15:19.583
Uh-uh-uh, there was
an argument about week
ago..

15:19.667 --> 15:23.917
...over money, I think.
Pops hit him. Valentine ran
off.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.959
'I told Pops, "Get out
of the neighborhood."'

15:26.041 --> 15:28.959
He said these kids
would be lost without
him.

15:29.959 --> 15:32.625
Valentine's not
at his apartment.

15:32.709 --> 15:34.250
You know where
else he could be?

15:34.333 --> 15:36.500
Uh, he works nights.

15:36.583 --> 15:37.792
'A restaurant, I think.'

15:37.875 --> 15:40.083
Which one?

15:40.166 --> 15:41.959
- Uh..
- W-what kind of food?

15:42.041 --> 15:43.917
Burgers? Tacos?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.834
What am I going to do now?

15:45.917 --> 15:48.917
Pops looked out for me.
He was my only family.

15:50.709 --> 15:52.709
All these cops here..

15:52.792 --> 15:54.333
...they're ready to move.

15:54.417 --> 15:57.458
Find the guy who
shot your grandfather.

15:57.542 --> 15:59.583
But we need your help.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.792
Can I see him?

16:06.500 --> 16:08.125
I'll take you
to the hospital..

16:08.208 --> 16:10.125
'...soon as we're done.'

16:10.208 --> 16:11.250
Chicken.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.041
It's a chicken
place on
Susqie.

16:13.125 --> 16:14.625
Susqie, yeah. Let's go.

16:19.917 --> 16:21.166
Kid's been here all night.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.041
I would never hurt Pops!

16:23.125 --> 16:25.333
(Scotty)
'Word on the street is
you're the dangerous type.'

16:26.834 --> 16:28.125
Got the record to prove it.

16:28.208 --> 16:30.834
That was the past,
man. I've changed.

16:30.917 --> 16:33.709
A gun you were pulled over with
a few weeks ago says different.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.834
Gun wasn't even for me!

16:39.208 --> 16:41.542
That gun was for Pops.

16:41.625 --> 16:45.500
A kid comes to me.
He said he wants $50 a week.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.083
Protection, he tells me.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.625
I tell him to just go.

16:48.709 --> 16:50.750
But he came back, didn't he?

16:50.834 --> 16:53.417
Acting tough,
knocking stuff over.

16:53.500 --> 16:57.041
Ain't no act.
The Dominicans play for
keeps.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.875
They already took
over the drug trade.

17:00.959 --> 17:04.291
- How you going to stand
tall?
- Kids is kids.

17:04.375 --> 17:07.000
You were just like that,
not too long ago.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.250
Look at you now.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.083
Put a quarter down there.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.667
Pops, I was going
to pay for it, man.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.208
(Pops)
'Yeah.'

17:14.291 --> 17:15.333
I'm just saying
the neighborhood's

17:15.417 --> 17:16.625
changed since my day.

17:16.709 --> 17:18.792
[chuckles]
Your day?

17:20.667 --> 17:22.917
Your day was three years ago.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.250
This is another punk
who thinks he's

17:25.333 --> 17:28.125
the baddest ass in
the neighborhood.

17:28.208 --> 17:29.792
Yeah, you the boss.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.667
It's good you
remembered that.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.041
What the hell?

17:41.417 --> 17:43.625
It's a prank.

17:43.709 --> 17:45.834
Nah, this ain't
no prank, Pops.

17:47.709 --> 17:50.000
Look, man, we got to get
you some real protection.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.542
What, a gun?

17:53.625 --> 17:56.750
I've been running
this store for 40 years.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.792
I stood my ground.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.125
And I didn't need
no gun to do it.

18:08.041 --> 18:11.625
Name's Francisco...Ariza.

18:11.709 --> 18:14.041
He's the first guy that
ever got under Pops'
skin.

18:14.125 --> 18:17.000
Your brilliant
idea to get a gun.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.125
That why you and Pops argued?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.667
Somebody had to
stand up to
Francisco.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.542
And I needed money to do it.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.333
- To buy another gun.
- 'Damn straight.'

18:26.417 --> 18:28.834
I was going to persuade
that Dominican son of a
bitch

18:28.917 --> 18:31.166
to stay away
from the old
man.

18:33.208 --> 18:36.083
Your man Jeffries
stops me before I get it.

18:37.709 --> 18:40.250
That the roll of cash
Jeffries
took from you yesterday?

18:42.041 --> 18:43.792
I stole it from Pops.

18:43.875 --> 18:47.625
Your man must have been bringing
it back to him when he got shot.

18:50.166 --> 18:51.875
Are we square?

18:51.959 --> 18:53.375
No, we ain't square.

18:53.458 --> 18:54.917
'You tell us where
to find Francisco.'

18:55.000 --> 18:58.083
Then do us all a favor.
Stop being so helpful.

18:58.166 --> 19:00.709
How long does it take to
get a ballistics report?

19:00.792 --> 19:02.083
No, no, I'm done talking to you!

19:02.166 --> 19:04.333
I want Carla on the phone, now!

19:06.000 --> 19:06.959
Hung up.

19:07.041 --> 19:08.542
Everyone's doing
what they can, Nick.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.667
- They pick up Valentine yet?
Alibied

19:10.750 --> 19:12.417
The gun he had was
for protecting Pops

19:12.500 --> 19:14.750
from a local banger,
Francisco Ariza.

19:14.834 --> 19:17.125
- Let's go get him.
- It's being handled.

19:17.208 --> 19:18.417
When was the last
time you slept?

19:18.500 --> 19:20.041
They been working
on Will for hours.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.458
I need to do
something for him,
boss.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.333
Come on.

19:33.834 --> 19:36.458
What the hell am I
supposed to do here?

19:38.500 --> 19:39.792
Pray.

19:59.041 --> 20:00.125
Will?

20:01.750 --> 20:02.750
No news.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.542
I saw you praying,
I figured--

20:04.625 --> 20:05.834
Oh, he's holding on.

20:07.166 --> 20:10.291
Uh, I got a record
for Francisco Ariza.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.792
Runs with Mara Este.

20:14.875 --> 20:17.500
"Carjacking, gun
possession,
extortion."

20:17.583 --> 20:18.917
Gang's hardcore.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.375
Francisco's been
shaking down local

20:20.458 --> 20:21.750
businesses for protection money.

20:21.834 --> 20:22.959
But Pops wouldn't pay.

20:23.041 --> 20:24.834
So, Francisco
makes him an example

20:24.917 --> 20:26.208
for the rest
of the
neighborhood?

20:26.291 --> 20:27.625
(male #4)
Shh.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.208
[whispering]
Do we know where he is?

20:31.291 --> 20:33.458
Last known address
was his mother's.

20:33.542 --> 20:35.458
She died four years ago.

20:35.542 --> 20:36.709
When Francisco's not locked up

20:36.792 --> 20:38.625
he's with a girlfriend
in West Kensington.

20:38.709 --> 20:40.583
We got anything we
can bring him in
with?

20:40.667 --> 20:43.083
Open bench warrant.
Possession with intent.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.959
- Rush and Valens are on it.
- 'Hmm.'

20:45.041 --> 20:46.625
If they're lucky,
he tries to run.

20:46.709 --> 20:48.333
- Shh!
- Hey, buddy!

20:48.417 --> 20:49.959
Listen, shush
me again and
I'll

20:50.041 --> 20:51.291
take your tongue
and I'll shove it
straight--

20:51.375 --> 20:53.917
Nick...let it go.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.375
What is it with people?

20:59.458 --> 21:00.917
It's a chapel.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.125
He's going to be okay.

21:19.792 --> 21:21.333
Nothing.

21:21.417 --> 21:22.834
Coffee's still on.

21:22.917 --> 21:24.542
'Someone was here
not too long ago.'

21:24.625 --> 21:28.000
(Scotty)
Landlord said
the girlfriend's out of
town.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.166
Maybe Francisco went for smokes?

21:30.250 --> 21:32.125
I don't think he's coming back.

21:43.709 --> 21:44.959
I'll call Bell
for a search warrant.

21:45.041 --> 21:47.041
I'll wake the judge.

21:54.542 --> 21:57.125
Heard on the radio
about a homicide detective

21:57.208 --> 21:59.583
getting shot.
He a friend of yours?

22:00.792 --> 22:03.333
Uh, name is Will Jeffries.

22:03.417 --> 22:05.041
I've known him a while now.

22:05.125 --> 22:06.750
He going to pull through?

22:06.834 --> 22:09.041
That's what they're saying.

22:11.208 --> 22:14.000
Anyway, I guess I just
wanted to see your face.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.333
Okay.

22:20.250 --> 22:22.667
(male #5)
I want you to have this.

22:22.750 --> 22:25.667
St. Jude. Patron saint
of lost causes.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.875
If you're anything
like me, you don't go in

22:27.959 --> 22:30.000
for spiritual mumbo-jumbo.

22:30.083 --> 22:33.917
Still, it's given me comfort
during some hard times.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.709
Uh, thanks.

22:41.792 --> 22:44.291
Be careful out there, okay?

22:46.709 --> 22:48.041
[whispers]
Yeah.

22:52.542 --> 22:53.959
Who's that?

22:55.583 --> 22:56.875
My father.

22:58.750 --> 22:59.834
Cooper.

23:03.041 --> 23:06.458
Yeah. Heard about Will,
wanted to make sure I'm
alright.

23:06.542 --> 23:08.083
Yeah.

23:08.166 --> 23:10.500
Tells me, "Be careful."

23:10.583 --> 23:13.083
No idea the same
thing happened to
me.

23:13.166 --> 23:14.458
Funny, right?

23:16.875 --> 23:19.291
- Where you going?
- Hospital.

23:19.375 --> 23:22.500
FBI tracked Francisco's
cell phone GPS for you.

23:22.583 --> 23:24.959
Ah, what is it, 7:00 a.m.?

23:25.041 --> 23:26.917
Never known feds to be
so quick on the uptake.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.500
Special agent in
charge owes me money.

23:28.583 --> 23:30.458
Can't play hold
'em
to save his life.

23:30.542 --> 23:34.083
The signal traces to
the Marshall housing
projects.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.792
Wait, that's two blocks
from Pops' store.

23:36.875 --> 23:39.333
Hey, listen, do me a favor.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.667
Don't take it easy on him.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.667
That's a promise.

23:51.583 --> 23:54.125
Francisco doesn't live here.

23:54.208 --> 23:56.041
Kind of hard to believe,
seeing as we found

23:56.125 --> 23:58.333
your nephew's cell phone
on the kitchen table.

23:58.417 --> 24:00.083
He left it last time he came by.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.625
That was a few days ago.
I been sick all week.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.125
'I got the bronchitis.
He hasn't been back.'

24:05.208 --> 24:06.834
But he made a call yesterday?

24:06.917 --> 24:08.291
- 'How's that happen?'
- No idea.

24:08.375 --> 24:11.125
Okay, this number
belongs to his
girlfriend.

24:11.208 --> 24:13.250
- What about the others?
- How should I know?

24:13.333 --> 24:15.875
Look, I want you
out of my apartment.

24:15.959 --> 24:17.792
- I got my rights!
- I'll give you a right.

24:17.875 --> 24:19.917
And a couple lefts too, if you
don't start talking straight.

24:21.041 --> 24:22.208
Hey, that was my mother's!

24:22.291 --> 24:24.875
We don't give a rat's
ass about the
furniture.

24:24.959 --> 24:27.458
- 'We want Francisco.'
- 'What do you want, huh?'

24:27.542 --> 24:30.792
- 'I'm being real.'
- How about you, Gabriel?

24:30.875 --> 24:32.125
I don't know where he is.

24:32.208 --> 24:34.834
I'd say the same thing
to protect my older
brother.

24:34.917 --> 24:38.041
But the best way to help is
telling me how to find him.

24:44.875 --> 24:45.959
A lot of cops out there

24:46.041 --> 24:48.375
pissed off
'cause of what he
did.

24:48.458 --> 24:50.750
They're not going to
consider his
well-being.

24:52.041 --> 24:55.875
But...I'll
guarantee his
safety.

24:55.959 --> 24:57.333
One younger brother to another.

24:57.417 --> 24:59.875
I'm not telling you nothing!

24:59.959 --> 25:01.583
Old man got what he deserved.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.583
You get the number or what?

25:07.542 --> 25:09.000
Alright, what you want,
man? You want some chips?

25:09.083 --> 25:10.792
Some popcorn or what?

25:10.875 --> 25:12.250
Can I get both?

25:12.333 --> 25:14.667
Yeah. Take them.
Both of 'em.

25:18.083 --> 25:20.208
Are you going to pay for that?

25:20.291 --> 25:22.500
Consider it an advance
on the money you owe me.

25:22.583 --> 25:24.583
[sniffles]
Fifty a week.

25:24.667 --> 25:27.583
- You listen, Boricua--
- I ain't no Boricua, man.

25:27.667 --> 25:29.417
I'm Dominican.

25:29.500 --> 25:33.041
What you are is
a disrespectful little
pissant.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.875
Didn't your father
teach you respect?

25:34.959 --> 25:36.458
Yo, don't talk
about my father,
man.

25:36.542 --> 25:38.000
Well, let me guess.

25:38.083 --> 25:39.583
Your daddy ran off
and he got lost

25:39.667 --> 25:42.250
in a crack pipe, killed?

25:42.333 --> 25:44.834
Ain't no version of
that I haven't heard.

25:44.917 --> 25:46.792
It's no excuse.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.542
'You think you're a big man'

25:48.625 --> 25:52.583
because you hustle honest
folks for your "50 a week!"

25:52.667 --> 25:54.917
You're a fool.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.834
Spend your time playing tough..

25:57.917 --> 25:59.625
...dodging bullets.

25:59.709 --> 26:01.542
For what?

26:01.625 --> 26:02.917
'A fat roll?'

26:03.834 --> 26:05.583
'It doesn't matter.'

26:05.667 --> 26:07.208
You're still going to be dead

26:07.291 --> 26:10.417
or in jail by
the time you're 25.

26:13.333 --> 26:14.583
Now, me..

26:16.083 --> 26:18.458
...I pay minimum wage.

26:18.542 --> 26:20.750
And I make you earn it.

26:20.834 --> 26:22.333
But it's honest.

26:22.417 --> 26:25.125
And it'll give you something
your thugging never did.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.959
A future.

26:28.041 --> 26:31.125
You got the stones
to work for that?

26:31.208 --> 26:34.542
Are you man enough to set an
example for this young one
here?

26:38.834 --> 26:40.083
Nah.

26:41.417 --> 26:43.959
You ain't nothing.

26:44.041 --> 26:46.625
You put that stuff down..

26:46.709 --> 26:49.625
...and you get the hell
out of my store.

26:55.333 --> 26:56.750
Old man shouldn't
have said that.

26:56.834 --> 26:58.291
'He didn't even
know my brother.'

26:58.375 --> 27:00.041
Yeah, and Francisco
shouldn't have shot
him.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.000
Screw you!

27:01.083 --> 27:02.083
Tell me where he is or I put

27:02.166 --> 27:03.208
'you and auntie here in cuffs'

27:03.291 --> 27:05.208
toss youse in a cell.

27:10.291 --> 27:11.500
I don't know.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.041
Right. Come on.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.375
(Scotty)
'Come on.'

27:25.959 --> 27:27.875
Hear our man's going
to make a full recovery.

27:27.959 --> 27:30.208
Came here as soon as I could.

27:30.291 --> 27:32.917
You found time to
put
on the dress blues.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.875
I want to convey
to Detective Jeffries

27:34.959 --> 27:37.667
the thanks of
a grateful city.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.875
News cameras are
downstairs, Pat.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.291
You're too cynical, John.

27:41.375 --> 27:42.792
[scoffs]
This from the
guy

27:42.875 --> 27:44.250
who investigates
one of my
detectives

27:44.333 --> 27:47.250
because Grover Boone's
got a personal beef with
me.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.667
IAB has a legitimate reason

27:49.750 --> 27:51.250
to investigate
Detective
Jeffries.

27:51.333 --> 27:52.750
Well, not anymore.

27:52.834 --> 27:54.583
Tell Boone Jeffries
wasn't on the take.

27:54.667 --> 27:57.583
He was retrieving
stolen
property, and I got
proof.

27:57.667 --> 28:00.417
Hmm, for the record..

28:00.500 --> 28:03.125
...it isn't Councilman
Boone who has the beef.

28:04.834 --> 28:07.458
I don't like the way
you do things.

28:07.542 --> 28:10.083
Frankly, I don't
like you, John.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.208
Never have.

28:15.333 --> 28:17.208
Oh, that's fine, Pat.

28:17.291 --> 28:19.875
But you ever mess with
someone under my command
again--

28:19.959 --> 28:22.000
What will you do, John?

28:25.834 --> 28:28.458
I will beat the
ever-loving
crap out of you.

28:55.375 --> 28:57.959
Feel like you got
hit by a bus, huh?

28:59.709 --> 29:02.000
It's more like
a freight train.

29:04.959 --> 29:06.333
Pops?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.834
He was a friend of yours, huh?

29:15.542 --> 29:17.333
He was more than that.

29:20.917 --> 29:23.208
You're not going
to buy nothing
today?

29:24.917 --> 29:26.208
Just looking.

29:27.458 --> 29:29.625
Did that beer
just
fall in your
pocket?

29:34.083 --> 29:36.000
Boy, you been robbing
me blind for months.

29:36.083 --> 29:37.959
I'm sick of it.

29:38.041 --> 29:40.041
I see you hanging
out on the streets

29:40.125 --> 29:41.959
giving your
mother a hard time

29:42.041 --> 29:44.583
bullying those other kids.

29:44.667 --> 29:47.083
Call the cops on me.

29:47.166 --> 29:50.333
Son, you owe me $79.27.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.250
I ain't got no money.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.500
Then you're
going
to work it off.

29:54.583 --> 29:57.041
I know your father
left,
and it's tough
times.

29:57.125 --> 29:58.750
But I tell you
what,
I don't care.

29:58.834 --> 29:59.917
You're a man now.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.458
You got a man's choice.

30:01.542 --> 30:03.375
Take this broom
and start
earning

30:03.458 --> 30:05.709
or get ready for the
whooping
of your young life.

30:11.667 --> 30:15.125
I took that broom,
worked there every day.

30:16.875 --> 30:20.208
He was the one that
got me into football..

30:20.291 --> 30:21.792
...straightened me out.

30:21.875 --> 30:24.083
You think he would've
given you that whooping?

30:25.583 --> 30:27.291
Without a doubt.

30:27.375 --> 30:28.625
'Pops is..'

30:30.417 --> 30:31.709
...was..

30:33.208 --> 30:35.250
'...pretty mean
when he wanted to be.'

30:36.750 --> 30:38.000
I don't know what
the neighborhood's

30:38.083 --> 30:40.208
going to do without him.

30:41.875 --> 30:44.000
You up to
talking
about the case?

30:44.083 --> 30:45.333
Yeah.

30:49.417 --> 30:50.834
Recognize him?

30:50.917 --> 30:53.208
Ah, Francisco Ariza.

30:54.959 --> 30:56.291
He the one who shot you?

30:56.375 --> 30:58.500
I didn't see who shot me

30:58.583 --> 31:00.834
but this guy's..

31:00.917 --> 31:03.875
...been giving Pops
trouble for a long time..

31:03.959 --> 31:05.583
'...shaking him down.'

31:05.667 --> 31:07.583
So, you knew about that?

31:07.667 --> 31:09.417
Huh.

31:09.500 --> 31:12.875
This whole thing with
Pops and Valentine..

31:12.959 --> 31:14.583
...we could've
helped you with
that.

31:15.583 --> 31:18.333
Some roads you got
to travel alone.

31:20.542 --> 31:24.583
I've been turning over every
rock...looking for this kid.

31:24.667 --> 31:27.291
Aunt's house,
local hangouts

31:27.375 --> 31:29.250
his girlfriend's place..

31:29.333 --> 31:30.583
Girlfriend?

31:31.333 --> 31:32.709
Which one?

31:34.375 --> 31:35.959
(man on radio)
'Report of a break-in
and shooting.'

31:36.041 --> 31:39.166
'Rescue squad in route,
one victim Francisco Ariza.'

31:39.250 --> 31:42.583
'We have the doer in custody.
Black male, James Valentine.'

31:44.375 --> 31:46.875
Now, we're square.

31:46.959 --> 31:48.250
This way.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.792
Valentine dropped his gun.

31:54.875 --> 31:57.083
He was just sitting here
when the cops came in.

32:05.250 --> 32:08.000
What size were the shoes we
pulled out of the trash can?

32:08.083 --> 32:10.792
It was average.
Nine, ten maybe.

32:10.875 --> 32:12.875
Those look average size to you?

32:15.583 --> 32:17.709
Valentine shot the wrong guy.

32:18.959 --> 32:20.792
Doer's still out there.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.083
Well, Will Jeffries
spent a lot of time

32:36.166 --> 32:37.917
keeping you out of trouble.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.125
Fixed it when you
got caught with a gun..

32:40.208 --> 32:42.250
...and stopped you
from buying another.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.583
So, where'd you
get this one from?

32:43.667 --> 32:45.917
Luther's Chicken.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.834
Manager keeps it in his
office in case we get
robbed.

32:50.583 --> 32:52.208
You turned your life
around, Valentine.

32:52.291 --> 32:55.125
You made something of yourself.

32:55.208 --> 32:58.000
- And you just threw it away.
- I warned Francisco.

32:59.041 --> 33:01.125
Stay away from Pops.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.959
He laughed at me!

33:05.041 --> 33:07.250
And y'all ain't lift
a finger to help.

33:10.458 --> 33:13.083
Somebody had to make him pay.

33:13.166 --> 33:16.000
You screwed up though.

33:16.083 --> 33:17.417
'Cause you killed the wrong guy.

33:17.500 --> 33:18.750
[scoffs]
Get out of here, wrong guy.

33:18.834 --> 33:20.208
Francisco killed Pops.

33:20.291 --> 33:21.542
- 'Cold!'
- Why are you so sure?

33:21.625 --> 33:22.917
'Cause he told me!

33:23.917 --> 33:25.500
Get in there!

33:25.583 --> 33:27.041
Whoa, wait, hold on, man.

33:27.125 --> 33:28.375
Put the gun down, yo!

33:28.458 --> 33:30.750
You just couldn't
leave Pops alone!

33:30.834 --> 33:32.000
Why'd you got
to go and kill him?

33:32.083 --> 33:33.417
I've been here
all night, alright?

33:33.500 --> 33:35.250
Look, I've been...ask her
if you don't believe me.

33:35.333 --> 33:38.083
Why should I believe you,
man?
Why should I believe you?

33:38.166 --> 33:39.959
- Get in there. Get in
there.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:40.041 --> 33:42.083
Get in there! Get in there!

33:42.166 --> 33:43.667
Look, man, I'm sorry, okay?

33:43.750 --> 33:45.625
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake? Huh?

33:45.709 --> 33:46.875
What's that
supposed to mean?

33:46.959 --> 33:48.542
Just...you got it
all wrong, man.

33:48.625 --> 33:50.417
Alright, look-look, we
got to be men about this.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.083
- 'We got to work this out.'
- 'Calm down..'

33:52.166 --> 33:54.458
Where were you at midnight?

33:54.542 --> 33:56.500
[Valentine shouts]
'Huh?'

33:56.583 --> 33:58.250
'Answer me!'

34:01.375 --> 34:04.333
- That's what I thought.
- No, no, no!

34:05.917 --> 34:08.041
He got what he deserved.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.500
Got the footprints
at the murder scene.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.291
'Shoes and a shirt
the killer wore.'

34:14.375 --> 34:16.542
'None of them match Francisco.'

34:19.333 --> 34:21.417
You understand what I'm saying?

34:21.500 --> 34:22.667
'He was as innocent as you.'

34:22.750 --> 34:25.333
And now he's as dead as Pops.

34:25.417 --> 34:27.375
No, no, no.

34:28.834 --> 34:32.000
You're going to have a lot of
time to think on that in
prison.

34:32.083 --> 34:34.333
Why he ain't just
tell me then? Hmm?

34:45.709 --> 34:47.333
Hey, hey, hey.

34:48.875 --> 34:50.417
I want to apologize..

34:50.500 --> 34:52.125
'...for the way I acted before.'

34:52.208 --> 34:54.000
My buddy was in
a bad way for a while.

34:54.083 --> 34:56.083
It's no excuse..

34:56.166 --> 34:58.667
...but he pulled through.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.917
I was way out of line.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.166
You got every right to take
a swing at me if you want.

35:05.583 --> 35:09.500
I hope everything's okay
with your loved ones too.

35:10.834 --> 35:13.125
Don't want to talk
about it, that's cool.

35:18.041 --> 35:19.250
Nick?

35:26.667 --> 35:28.917
When was the last
time you slept?

35:29.000 --> 35:32.750
I'm really getting the hang
of this, uh, prayer thing.

35:32.834 --> 35:35.542
Just don't set off
the smoke alarm.

35:35.625 --> 35:37.375
Did you see Will?

35:37.458 --> 35:38.834
Yeah.

35:39.750 --> 35:42.166
Hey, why don't you go home, huh?

35:42.250 --> 35:44.834
Catch some Zs.
I'll stay here.

35:44.917 --> 35:46.959
It's Will's place.

35:47.041 --> 35:48.333
Not mine.

35:49.166 --> 35:50.750
Wouldn't feel right.

35:50.834 --> 35:53.041
Him being here,
me being there.

35:55.792 --> 35:58.041
Well, anytime
something
like this happens

35:58.125 --> 36:00.458
it's part of the
job,
we all know that,
but..

36:02.125 --> 36:04.583
...you just never think..

36:04.667 --> 36:05.917
I mean..

36:07.625 --> 36:08.875
I don't know.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.166
Yeah.

36:12.250 --> 36:13.542
Me too.

36:17.333 --> 36:18.750
Video was in bad shape.

36:18.834 --> 36:21.333
Polyurethane from
the tape absorbed water.

36:21.417 --> 36:23.291
I had to go in
and dry it by hand.

36:23.375 --> 36:26.083
Literally baked the tape
with a hairdryer..

36:26.166 --> 36:28.250
...and a bunch of other stuff
you guys don't care about.

36:28.333 --> 36:29.250
Here's what I got.

36:29.333 --> 36:30.291
'This is from a few hours'

36:30.375 --> 36:31.834
'before the shooting.'

36:41.792 --> 36:43.625
- Good job, Frankie.
- 'Yeah.'

36:43.709 --> 36:45.208
Yeah, thanks.

36:46.542 --> 36:50.375
[sighs]
Francisco and Pops made peace?

36:50.458 --> 36:51.834
'He all but took responsibility'

36:51.917 --> 36:54.667
for Pops' murder
with his dying breath.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.625
Protecting someone?

36:56.709 --> 36:58.083
(Lilly)
'Who?'

37:05.917 --> 37:07.417
I know who.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.041
Hey.

37:11.375 --> 37:12.542
Where's the kid
who was in here?

37:12.625 --> 37:13.959
Gabriel? I told
you to watch
him.

37:14.041 --> 37:16.041
Cut him loose. His brother died.

37:16.125 --> 37:18.709
No need to keep him.

37:18.792 --> 37:20.125
Right?

37:25.250 --> 37:27.417
(Scotty)
'Open up. Police.'

37:34.333 --> 37:36.000
Let's see your
hands, Gabriel.

37:37.875 --> 37:38.834
No!

37:41.792 --> 37:44.333
- Scotty?
- I'm okay.

37:47.834 --> 37:49.250
You're making
a mistake, Gabriel.

37:49.333 --> 37:50.834
You killed my brother!

37:53.250 --> 37:55.333
Put the damn gun down!
We didn't touch Francisco.

37:55.417 --> 37:58.458
- That's a lie!
- You gonna shoot my partner?

37:58.542 --> 38:00.542
Is that the big plan here?

38:04.709 --> 38:06.166
This isn't a game.

38:06.250 --> 38:09.709
And those weren't warning
shots. I won't miss again.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.834
Listen to her, Gabriel.

38:15.917 --> 38:17.500
(Scotty)
'This isn't what
your brother died for.'

38:17.583 --> 38:19.208
(Gabriel)
'You don't know
about my brother.'

38:19.291 --> 38:20.959
(Scotty)
'Yeah, I know
Francisco was smart.'

38:21.041 --> 38:22.834
He made peace with Pops.

38:22.917 --> 38:24.417
'Wanted this feud to end.'

38:24.500 --> 38:26.166
But he hated that old man.

38:26.250 --> 38:28.000
(Scotty)
'Maybe.'

38:28.083 --> 38:30.542
'But he knew Pops was right.'

38:30.625 --> 38:31.917
- 'He took that job.'
- No!

38:32.000 --> 38:33.417
(Scotty)
'Y-you figure he'd be proud'

38:33.500 --> 38:35.041
'of you for killing Pops?
Shooting my friend?'

38:35.125 --> 38:36.583
'I mean, think about it.'

38:43.250 --> 38:44.875
<i>(Francisco)</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

38:44.959 --> 38:46.208
<i>What happened?</i>

38:46.291 --> 38:48.667
<i>Gabriel, what happened?</i>
<i>What'd you do?</i>

38:48.750 --> 38:50.667
<i>What have you done?</i>

38:51.875 --> 38:54.125
<i>No, why did you do it?</i>

38:54.208 --> 38:56.000
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

39:04.709 --> 39:06.959
(Scotty)
'Francisco was
looking out for you.'

39:07.041 --> 39:09.583
It's what a man does.

39:09.667 --> 39:11.333
'He took a bullet so
you could have a life.'

39:11.417 --> 39:13.375
'Don't let it end here.'

39:13.458 --> 39:15.041
'Be a man.'

39:15.125 --> 39:17.709
I don't need an excuse
to take you out.

39:17.792 --> 39:19.041
I want to.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.583
Give me a reason not to.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.792
All clear.

39:40.375 --> 39:41.667
(Scotty)
'Come on.'

39:46.959 --> 39:48.875
Come on.

39:48.959 --> 39:50.333
Gonna need an ambulance.

39:52.250 --> 39:54.250
You got to believe me.

39:54.333 --> 39:57.750
[sobbing]
I didn't mean it.

40:01.375 --> 40:02.333
(Pops)
'I told you, Landry.'

40:02.417 --> 40:04.667
I'm not serving you tonight.

40:22.041 --> 40:23.500
Anyone here?

40:26.750 --> 40:28.000
Hello?

40:47.834 --> 40:50.375
(Nick)
'Will. Will!'

43:59.792 --> 44:01.000
