WEBVTT

00:06.407 --> 00:08.779
Guess who's on her way
to volleyball practice?

00:08.779 --> 00:10.681
Hmm, let's see.

00:10.681 --> 00:12.713
You're wearing
a volleyball uniform
and holding a volleyball,

00:12.713 --> 00:14.545
so it can't be you,
that'd be too obvious.

00:17.088 --> 00:20.091
And volleyball
is at the same time
as the mystery book club,

00:20.091 --> 00:21.652
so we can rule out
anyone from that.

00:21.652 --> 00:24.095
Unless they're trying
to throw me off their scent!

00:24.095 --> 00:26.627
It's me, I'm on my way
to volleyball practice!

00:26.627 --> 00:29.100
You're doing a sport?

00:29.100 --> 00:32.533
Skidmore says we have
to devote all our time
to our talents.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.765
(SCOFFS) She also says
we can't drink from
the water fountain

00:34.765 --> 00:37.568
without leaving
a quarter in the jar,
but everyone does.

00:37.568 --> 00:40.471
What? I pay every time!

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:49.280 --> 00:51.422
Chyna, what do you
think you're doing?

00:51.422 --> 00:53.654
You need to focus
on your music.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.586
You cannot play a sport.

00:55.586 --> 00:58.089
I'm not playing a sport!

00:58.089 --> 01:01.462
This is a musical
instrument called...

01:02.693 --> 01:04.795
The volleydrum.
(CHUCKLES)

01:05.636 --> 01:07.668
(PLAYING RHYTHMICALLY)

01:08.839 --> 01:12.703
I'm going to meet
11 other girls
in the gym

01:12.703 --> 01:14.375
for a volleydrum circle.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.548
Hey, Olive!

01:17.548 --> 01:20.651
Check out the stuff
I'm going to break
with my Sensei...

01:20.651 --> 01:22.653
...tional new chisel!

01:24.615 --> 01:27.588
I'm making a sculpture
that has nothing

01:27.588 --> 01:29.760
to do with karate.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

01:29.760 --> 01:31.592
(CHUCKLES MOCKINGLY)
Nice try.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.394
I wasn't born yesterday.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.226
Oh, we're well
aware of that.

01:35.726 --> 01:38.098
I said no sports!

01:38.098 --> 01:40.431
(SIGHS) But,
Principal Skidmore,
sports are fun.

01:40.431 --> 01:41.702
Don't you want
us to be happy?

01:41.702 --> 01:44.535
No! School isn't
a place to be happy!

01:46.777 --> 01:48.709
Man!

01:48.709 --> 01:51.312
And guess who was
supposed to be first up
in the karate tournament?

01:51.312 --> 01:53.484
Let's see.
You're wearing
a karate gi,

01:53.484 --> 01:56.647
and you're completely
uncoordinated,
so it can't be you.

I want to be on
a sports team.

02:57.708 --> 02:59.510
Right now,
all of my trophies
look like this.

03:02.653 --> 03:03.914
Or this.

03:05.956 --> 03:08.419
But I want a trophy
that looks like this.

03:10.761 --> 03:11.762
Or this.

03:15.626 --> 03:17.928
Why are you wearing
four scarves?

03:17.928 --> 03:21.672
Because Granny is coming
and if we don't wear
the things she knitted us,

03:21.672 --> 03:24.535
she'll get upset,
and she knits
when she's upset.

03:24.535 --> 03:26.937
It's a vicious cycle.

03:26.937 --> 03:28.979
Grammy's coming?
(CHUCKLES)

03:28.979 --> 03:30.741
Wait, right now?

03:30.741 --> 03:33.314
Oh! (GRUNTING)

03:33.314 --> 03:35.816
Why can't she
just be lazy
and give us cash?

03:36.947 --> 03:38.419
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

03:42.953 --> 03:44.855
(GASPS)
 BOTH: Grammy!

03:44.855 --> 03:47.898
There's my little Bunny Bear
and Honey Bear! (CHUCKLES)

03:47.898 --> 03:49.800
(GRUNTS)
Can't breathe.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.962
(GRUNTS) I wish
I couldn't breathe!

03:53.434 --> 03:55.235
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

03:55.235 --> 03:57.668
I'm so glad
you're here,
Grammy! (PANTS)

03:57.668 --> 04:01.512
Chyna, look at you!
You've grown so much!

04:01.512 --> 04:03.474
And, Cameron...

04:03.474 --> 04:04.815
Hello.

04:06.617 --> 04:07.918
How was your trip,
Grammy?

04:07.918 --> 04:09.650
Not bad.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.853
But can you believe
they had the nerve to make
me check my carry on?

04:16.687 --> 04:19.690
But it was all worth it
to come and see you guys!

04:19.690 --> 04:21.892
(CHUCKLES)
 And now that
I have retired

04:21.892 --> 04:24.565
from my teaching career,
I have plenty of time

04:24.565 --> 04:26.467
to come do
fun stuff with you.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.599
Oh, you mean,
like go out to lunch?
 Yes!

04:28.599 --> 04:30.771
And we can go
to the symphony!
 Yes!

04:30.771 --> 04:32.543
Yes! And we can
go get manicures.

04:32.543 --> 04:33.604
Yeah!

04:36.547 --> 04:39.850
There is nothing wrong
with a man having
nicely groomed cuticles.

04:42.513 --> 04:44.715
A manicure
sounds great!
 (CHUCKLES)

04:44.715 --> 04:46.917
Unfortunately,
I would have
to take off

04:46.917 --> 04:49.690
these beautiful mittens
you knitted for me,

04:49.690 --> 04:52.393
which I'm wearing
even though it's
85 degrees outside.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.064
(CHUCKLES)
 Aw...

04:54.064 --> 04:56.997
And I was gonna get
you cash as a present
this time.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.530
I'll just use that
money to buy yarn

04:59.530 --> 05:02.673
and crochet you
matching bathing suits.

05:02.673 --> 05:03.904
(CHUCKLES)

05:03.904 --> 05:05.736
Huh...

05:05.736 --> 05:07.638
Matching brother
and sister wool
bathing suits?

05:07.638 --> 05:09.710
Mmm-hmm.
 BOTH: Great.

05:15.416 --> 05:19.049
Oh, I'm so thirsty,
but I only have a dollar.

05:19.049 --> 05:21.091
Then you'll have
to pay for four sips.

05:21.091 --> 05:25.025
I can't. I have to save
money to use the bathroom.

05:25.025 --> 05:29.360
Wow. She charges
for water on the way in
and on the way out.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.633
Yeah, well, I figured out
how to avoid those fees.

05:33.964 --> 05:36.767
(SCOFFS) You brought
your own water?

05:36.767 --> 05:39.109
Yes. That, that's
what's in here. Water.

05:41.412 --> 05:43.514
Well, between this
and the sports thing,

05:43.514 --> 05:45.776
Skidmore is the worst
principal ever.

05:45.776 --> 05:47.848
I wish she'd just hurry
and retire already.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.780
It's never going
to happen. (SCOFFS)

05:49.780 --> 05:51.652
She's worked here forever.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.654
I heard they physically
built the school
around her.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.128
Well, maybe she just
needs a little push.

05:58.128 --> 05:59.129
Follow my lead.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.664
Principal Skidmore,
are you okay?

06:03.664 --> 06:04.765
You look tired.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.139
Actually,
you look retired.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.403
(MOUTHING)

06:12.403 --> 06:15.476
I'm not tired.
I just took a three hour
nap in my office.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.547
Uh-oh.

06:16.547 --> 06:18.409
What?

06:18.409 --> 06:22.583
Well, apparently
excessive napping is one
of the symptoms of COS.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.385
Chronic Over-Employment
Syndrome.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.658
Oh, that's not a real thing!

06:28.659 --> 06:30.160
Oh, no.

06:30.160 --> 06:34.164
Skepticism about COS
is one of the tell-tale
symptoms of COS.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.499
What are the other symptoms?

06:39.770 --> 06:41.131
Is the room spinning?

06:45.436 --> 06:46.907
Yes!

06:46.907 --> 06:49.179
Yes, I... I think
I might have COS!

06:49.179 --> 06:51.411
You should be
wearing a mask.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.485
Not because
it's contagious.
Because, well...

06:54.485 --> 06:56.086
You should
just wear a mask.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.790
Well, what is the cure?

06:59.790 --> 07:00.991
There is none.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.126
Yes, there is, Fletcher!

07:06.126 --> 07:09.099
There's been a recent
breakthrough and now
there is one!

07:09.760 --> 07:11.101
Retirement!

07:11.101 --> 07:13.133
You think
I should retire?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.866
Well, as much
as I would hate
to see you leave,

07:15.866 --> 07:17.738
it's the only
way to save you.

07:17.738 --> 07:20.140
But retirement does
have its benefits.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.172
You can read
for pleasure.

07:22.172 --> 07:24.444
Ooh, that sounds good!
 Go to museums.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.977
Museums are great!
 Learn a new language.

07:26.977 --> 07:29.820
Ooh, how about
the Greenlandic
language Inuktitut.

07:32.483 --> 07:34.755
I'm gonna need
to think about this.

07:36.687 --> 07:38.128
She's gonna
think about it!

07:38.128 --> 07:40.731
Nice job
making retirement
sound fun, Olive!

07:40.731 --> 07:43.033
What do you mean?
It really does
sound fun!

07:43.033 --> 07:44.795
I wish I were old.

07:44.795 --> 07:47.498
I can't believe
I have my whole life
in front of me.

07:52.242 --> 07:59.009
Chyna, I talked to my doctor
and he confirmed I had COS,
and agreed I should retire.

07:59.009 --> 08:00.981
He did?
 Mmm-hmm.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.754
Um, he also told me that
I could cure my headaches

08:03.754 --> 08:06.817
by rubbing this
prescription rock
on my forehead.

08:09.590 --> 08:13.724
(CHUCKLES)
Well, I think you made
the right decision.

08:13.724 --> 08:16.496
And now that
you're retired,

08:16.496 --> 08:19.229
I think that you should
take some of that time to...

08:19.229 --> 08:20.631
I don't know,

08:20.631 --> 08:24.104
search for a new doctor?
(CHUCKLES)

08:24.104 --> 08:26.977
Do you think people
are going to miss
me around here?

08:26.977 --> 08:28.508
Of course!
 (CHUCKLES)

08:28.508 --> 08:30.510
STUDENTS: (CHANTING)
No more Skidmore!

08:30.510 --> 08:32.282
ALL: No more Skidmore!

08:32.282 --> 08:34.183
No more Skidmore!

08:34.183 --> 08:36.046
No more Skidmore!

08:36.046 --> 08:37.548
(CLAMORING)

08:37.548 --> 08:39.620
STUDENTS: No more Skidmore!

08:39.620 --> 08:43.654
See? They're fighting
over who gets to take
your statue home!

08:51.161 --> 08:55.035
Welcome to IHOW,
the International House
of Whatever.

08:56.306 --> 08:58.639
Less yap-yap
and more chop-chop!

08:58.639 --> 08:59.640
(SCREAMS)

09:06.316 --> 09:10.080
Principal Skidmore?
What are you doing here?

09:10.080 --> 09:12.853
Getting together with
my new retirement group,

09:12.853 --> 09:16.587
the Artificial Hipsters.

09:16.587 --> 09:20.230
And this is the only place
that offers a 10%
discount for seniors.

09:20.230 --> 09:22.332
That's seniors in high school!

09:22.332 --> 09:24.234
It says it right on the menu.

09:24.234 --> 09:26.597
You can't expect me
to read this tiny print!

09:33.173 --> 09:34.304
Susan?

09:34.304 --> 09:36.046
Susan Skidmore?

09:36.046 --> 09:37.848
How the heck are ya?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.281
Are you enjoying retirement?

09:41.281 --> 09:42.783
I bet you are!

09:42.783 --> 09:43.984
Or I was.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.659
Oh, Susan, your wit
is as dry as your

09:49.890 --> 09:51.822
skin.

09:51.822 --> 09:53.363
You might want
to try cocoa butter.

09:53.363 --> 09:55.696
It's what keeps me
looking so youthful.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.628
Well, that and the fact
that I'm young.

09:59.730 --> 10:02.302
Ooh, I see
we're playing Mahjong.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.274
Interesting factoid
about Mahjong.

10:04.274 --> 10:07.007
Legend has it the game
was developed by Confucius

10:07.007 --> 10:09.379
who called it ma jiang
 meaning sparrow,

10:09.379 --> 10:11.081
because he was
a lover of birds.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.620
It is so nice
having Skidmore gone!

10:20.620 --> 10:22.292
We can finally do
what we want!

10:22.292 --> 10:24.354
Like play volleyball
and smile.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.359
I just hope
the new principal lets us
use the bathroom for free.

10:29.359 --> 10:31.662
I've been holding it in
since the ninth grade.

10:32.963 --> 10:34.735
Well, we're about to find out.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.967
The new principal's
about to walk right
through that door.

10:40.711 --> 10:43.774
Wacky is our new principal?

10:43.774 --> 10:47.317
(SIGHS) No, he's dressed
like that because
he was in court.

10:47.317 --> 10:49.319
He's been accused
of blowing a house down.

10:52.883 --> 10:53.984
BOTH: Grammy?

10:53.984 --> 10:56.186
It's Principal Grammy now!

10:57.688 --> 10:59.830
I am replacing
Miss Skidmore.

10:59.830 --> 11:02.292
Now I can spend
quality time

11:02.292 --> 11:05.996
with my Bunny Bear
and Honey Bear all day,
every day!

11:05.996 --> 11:08.398
(BOTH GRUNTING)

11:08.398 --> 11:11.702
And I can't wait
to meet all your friends!

11:11.702 --> 11:13.974
Which of you are my
grandbabies' friends?

11:15.245 --> 11:18.148
You all should be,
they're delightful!
(LAUGHS)

11:18.148 --> 11:21.051
They used to take
baths together.

11:21.051 --> 11:22.682
(STUDENTS LAUGHING)

11:22.682 --> 11:25.015
It was so cute!
Oh, wait, wait.

11:25.015 --> 11:26.717
Here's a picture of it!

my white belt in karate.

15:59.529 --> 16:01.061

gave you that

16:01.061 --> 16:03.233
because no one wanted to see
you with your robe open.

pieced together the story
of how I earned it.

doing is not karate.
