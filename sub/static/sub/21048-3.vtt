00:11.541 --> 00:13.655
Officer Jukes, I'm with the Interpol...

00:14.188 --> 00:16.085
Serious Financial Crime Agency.

00:18.187 --> 00:20.851
Monseur Clios had a safe room installed.

00:20.881 --> 00:23.348
The safe code has 8 digits.
What is it?

00:23.378 --> 00:24.963
I don't know that.
Well, who does?

00:24.993 --> 00:26.162
Only Christos.

00:27.543 --> 00:32.137
The estate, the Clios Foundation and
all the holdings of the Clios Bank

00:32.168 --> 00:36.356
and family are to be frozen
pending a criminal investigation.

00:37.139 --> 00:39.369
Is my husband really dead?
That's insane!

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

01:49.032 --> 01:49.864
You can shoot.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.960
I didn't expect that from someone like you.

01:55.791 --> 01:56.840
Welcome here.

01:58.256 --> 02:02.169
I think you were right about the yacht.
That it wasn't an accident

02:03.151 --> 02:06.747
and I think we can help each other
share what we know.

02:09.178 --> 02:11.608
I found this in Constantine's things.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.730
I think it says...
Elena.

02:15.629 --> 02:18.926
She's the only survivior from the explosion.
Do you know her?

02:26.818 --> 02:30.247
I want to know what kind of business
my husband did with your father.

02:32.012 --> 02:33.444
Whatever it was,

02:35.142 --> 02:36.657
if my father was involved

02:37.759 --> 02:39.224
it would have been malignant.

02:42.371 --> 02:46.250
I see it in you now...that look.

02:47.914 --> 02:50.645
What look?
Dolor de mistura...

02:52.849 --> 02:53.982
Revenge!

03:00.058 --> 03:03.588
<b> <i>You and I are cut from the same ice</i> </b>

03:04.002 --> 03:07.265
<b> <i>Sincerity made us the perfect heist.</i> </b>

03:07.576 --> 03:11.012

03:11.042 --> 03:14.901

03:14.931 --> 03:18.758

03:18.788 --> 03:22.048

Do you understand me?</i>

04:13.642 --> 04:16.812
<i>Do you remember your name?
You're in the hospital.</i>

04:17.185 --> 04:18.743
<i>You've been in a coma
since you got here.</i>

04:20.608 --> 04:23.844
<i>If you please,
I'm going to call a doctor.</i>

04:26.045 --> 04:27.324
<i>I need to call the doctor.</i>

06:48.615 --> 06:51.147
Are you still using the
Master Bedroom? I can...

06:51.177 --> 06:52.302
stay where I am.

06:52.332 --> 06:53.770
No, no, it's fine.
You can have it.

06:54.017 --> 06:55.588
Therese will move my things
in the morning.

06:57.431 --> 06:58.350
Georgina,

07:00.334 --> 07:03.757
I can't imagine what you
must be feeling right now and I...

07:03.787 --> 07:07.037
know that being stuck in
this madhouse won't help, um

07:08.147 --> 07:12.875
what I'm trying to say,
rather inelegantly, is, um...

07:14.010 --> 07:15.208
I'm happy you're here.

07:16.780 --> 07:20.349
We're not all mad.
I know it really...

07:20.549 --> 07:22.427
seems that way and all the

07:22.613 --> 07:25.190
posturing that goes on
is just Clios bravado

07:25.220 --> 07:26.995
It's what passes as motion around here.

07:28.862 --> 07:31.725
But, we don't all feel that way.

07:32.671 --> 07:35.961
Some of us actually feel.

07:38.097 --> 07:40.507
Whatever you need, just ask.

07:44.063 --> 07:44.929
I'm glad you're here

07:47.744 --> 07:48.450
but I'm good.

07:52.799 --> 07:53.918
Benny, where were will we meet?

07:57.427 --> 07:58.772
Probably best right now

07:58.802 --> 08:01.162
because I'm going to swing by and see you

08:02.467 --> 08:05.211
Well, cancel them.
I need to see you.

08:07.222 --> 08:08.873
Thank you. Probably the things

08:09.146 --> 08:10.597
I'm gonna do when I...

08:15.259 --> 08:17.203
Listen, I gotta run.
I'll see you in a bit.

08:19.873 --> 08:20.845
Did you want something?

08:22.523 --> 08:23.642
We need to talk.

08:25.174 --> 08:26.918
Can't be easy, right?

08:26.948 --> 08:28.876
Being the strong one when
everything's going to shit.

08:31.668 --> 08:33.879
I don't have time for this.
I want to help.

08:33.909 --> 08:36.383
I don't need your help.
We need to work together.

08:36.889 --> 08:38.341
I barely know you.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.272
I think your father was murdered.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.994
I need to find out why.
Murdered?

08:43.659 --> 08:45.831
I just need to get into the safe room.

08:46.550 --> 08:47.296
Unbelievable!

08:47.682 --> 08:50.724
You have no right to stop me!
It's a Clios matter.

08:50.754 --> 08:53.307
What's in the safe room is
our business, not your's.

08:53.337 --> 08:55.821
What are you trying to hide?

08:55.851 --> 08:57.489
Ever wonder why Dad
never gave you the code?

08:58.879 --> 09:02.009
He made me promise not to
give it to anyone, especially not...

09:03.781 --> 09:05.645
to... What?

09:07.177 --> 09:08.056
the goldigger

09:10.756 --> 09:12.301
especially not to you.

09:47.954 --> 09:50.617
Perhaps, Judah thought that
his wife would discover the truth.

09:51.929 --> 09:53.101
Perhaps, he wanted her to.

10:06.097 --> 10:06.657
Robert?

10:08.535 --> 10:09.840
That forger of yours...

10:10.493 --> 10:11.678
I need to talk to him.

10:13.992 --> 10:16.749
What do you mean you can't?
You can't or you won't?

10:19.719 --> 10:21.358
I'm running out of options here.

10:21.941 --> 10:23.486
Christos won't give me anything!

10:24.059 --> 10:25.817
The level of deception in this family is...

10:26.642 --> 10:27.881
I can't trust anyone!

10:30.265 --> 10:31.850
My husband is dead.

10:32.371 --> 10:34.941
You don't get to decide what
I know and what I don't know!

10:40.931 --> 10:42.849
Alright, text it to me.

10:47.599 --> 10:51.528
<i>Only one of Negrescu's girls would do
something like this, for sure.</i>

10:53.011 --> 10:56.261
<i>All due respect, Karim, but not every
sex worker belongs to him.</i>

10:59.204 --> 11:02.973
<i>Go talk to the girls,
ask some questions.</i>

11:05.708 --> 11:07.333
Can't vouch for the taste

11:07.932 --> 11:09.104
but it's warm, at least.

11:10.103 --> 11:13.793
Thank you for being so quick
to take up my invitation, Mr. Clios.

11:14.119 --> 11:16.210
We asked your father
along here a year ago.

11:16.756 --> 11:18.727
Well, maybe you forgot
to include an RSVP.

11:19.726 --> 11:20.951
Well, we should get started.

11:21.870 --> 11:23.015
There's a great deal to cover.

11:24.461 --> 11:27.192
The Brandeis art transactions...

11:27.222 --> 11:28.297
the Cayman loans

11:32.865 --> 11:34.477
Where do you think we should begin?

11:34.632 --> 11:37.536
We advise our client not to
engage in this line of questioning

11:37.566 --> 11:40.572
unless you can provide concrete
evidence of some wrongdoing,

11:40.865 --> 11:44.102
Otherwise, this is a
monumental waste of Mr. Clios' time.

11:44.341 --> 11:45.234
Ok, fine.

11:45.870 --> 11:50.025
Our people are making good progress with
Constantine's money laundering trail,

11:50.055 --> 11:51.171
but it will take time.

11:51.570 --> 11:54.886
And the longer it takes, the
longer the bank stays closed.

11:55.584 --> 11:58.834
Once again, we advise our client
not to engage in this line of...

11:59.860 --> 12:02.830
There are tens of thousands
of pages of documents

12:02.860 --> 12:04.947
we've requisitioned from your office

12:04.977 --> 12:06.191
Boxes...hundreds of them.

12:06.221 --> 12:08.881
Yeah, well, I hope you
have a good filing system.

12:12.269 --> 12:13.694
Is that what you came here to say?

12:14.507 --> 12:17.343
You telling me you won't even
talk to me about John Brandeis?

12:17.373 --> 12:20.433
On behalf of our client, we would
suggest that you direct queries

12:20.463 --> 12:23.545
on the subject of John Brandeis
in the direction of John Brandeis.

12:23.575 --> 12:27.220
Or you could show us some evidence.
Until then, we will not respond.

12:27.362 --> 12:28.760
And this meeting is adjourned.

12:35.517 --> 12:36.449
Really is bad.

13:27.635 --> 13:29.459
You forged a painting for my husband.

13:30.232 --> 13:32.616
No, no, no!
I just want to talk.

13:33.681 --> 13:34.654
Please.

13:44.337 --> 13:45.149
Well?

13:47.325 --> 13:50.548
Your work has a certain energy.
I'm glad you like it...

13:51.108 --> 13:54.118
but I'm afraid I know nothing about
your husband or any forged painting.

13:54.331 --> 13:55.436
Do you know who I am?

13:57.350 --> 14:00.307
I'm Georgina Clios...
of the Clios Foundation.

14:00.679 --> 14:03.903
I've heard of you, yes.
But I haven't heard of you.

14:04.409 --> 14:06.020
Lucas...

14:07.352 --> 14:08.191
Carlssen?

14:09.054 --> 14:10.732
Is that why you got
into this line of work?

14:12.024 --> 14:12.384
Get out!

14:12.414 --> 14:14.541
How many paintings did
you forge for my husband?

14:14.571 --> 14:15.780
I don't have to tell you anything.

14:18.022 --> 14:19.208
One word from me...

14:19.767 --> 14:22.018
and no gallery will touch you.
Who do you think you are?

14:23.230 --> 14:24.855
You stuck-up bitch!

14:24.885 --> 14:28.424
Spending money for entitled rich fucks!
Sometimes, that's true, yes...

14:28.751 --> 14:30.523
but success requires talent.

14:31.601 --> 14:34.558
Maybe you need to try harder.
Get the fuck out of my...

14:39.073 --> 14:40.165
You're not going to shoot me.

14:41.990 --> 14:42.935
You're gutless,

14:43.961 --> 14:46.318
just like the rest of all the
art world phonies around here.

14:47.144 --> 14:49.155
You wouldn't know real art
if it came...

14:51.933 --> 14:54.264
Ok! Ok, uyour husband

14:54.490 --> 14:56.209
had the copy made for some oligarch

14:56.239 --> 14:57.181
to put on his yacht.

14:58.180 --> 14:59.645
Ok? Really!

15:00.050 --> 15:01.049
That's all I know.

15:02.381 --> 15:04.085
Georgie, hey!

15:17.127 --> 15:18.792
I have known Lucas for years!

15:18.822 --> 15:20.443
He trusts me!
You went behind my back

15:20.473 --> 15:22.050
with Constantine.
Oh, that was business!

15:22.080 --> 15:23.821
Went behind my back,
forged my painting...

15:23.851 --> 15:26.165
No, your husband did that.
I simply made the introduction.

15:26.195 --> 15:27.617
You make it sound like it was nothing.

15:28.981 --> 15:29.661
Alright...

15:30.979 --> 15:31.552
I'm sorry.

15:32.258 --> 15:34.042
I'm sorry. I should have
told you about Carlssen.

15:34.072 --> 15:35.126
No more secrets.

15:37.643 --> 15:38.775
No more secrets.

15:39.641 --> 15:40.493
Do you mean that?

15:42.360 --> 15:42.666
Yeah.

15:45.237 --> 15:48.859
So, did he tell you anything useful?

15:50.302 --> 15:51.940
He says the painting was for Litvinov.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.510
but the fake is on my wall
which means the real Lorain...

15:55.963 --> 15:56.762
was on that yacht.

15:57.308 --> 15:59.745
15 million dollars at the
bottom of the Mediterranean.

16:00.381 --> 16:01.380
What a waste!

16:01.526 --> 16:03.564
What was Constantine
doing with Litvinov?

16:03.924 --> 16:04.603
Who knows.

16:09.696 --> 16:11.973
Really!
He never told me about it

16:12.306 --> 16:13.491
but i know there's something in there.

16:13.971 --> 16:15.343
Yeah, so what are we waiting for?

16:15.373 --> 16:16.715
I can't get in.
Why not?

16:16.745 --> 16:17.900
Fucking Christos!

16:26.944 --> 16:28.409
The staff wouldn't dare say a thing.

16:31.552 --> 16:33.737
Since when did you care?
Oh, your father might see

16:33.767 --> 16:36.656
Well, he's not here. He left for
work this morning or something.

16:40.483 --> 16:42.467
Wait a minute! You
want to see my father?

16:42.840 --> 16:43.826
Yeah, I need to talk to him.

16:47.209 --> 16:48.820
Oh, my God!
That's why you came.

16:51.130 --> 16:51.876
Sorry.

16:53.408 --> 16:53.821
Hey!

16:56.351 --> 16:56.911
Hey, Liv...

16:59.148 --> 17:00.813
Listen, I will make it up to you.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.106
Promise.

17:03.265 --> 17:06.248
Will you tell your father
that I want to speak to him?

17:07.060 --> 17:09.377
That depends. Impress me.

17:25.980 --> 17:28.098
No! Absolutely not! That...

17:28.364 --> 17:30.348
No fucking way!
That's a terrible idea!

17:30.378 --> 17:32.626
And even if it works, are you
sure you want to open that box?

17:33.033 --> 17:35.537
There is something in there that
Constantine didn't want me to see,

17:35.567 --> 17:36.669
I know it.
Exactly!

17:36.699 --> 17:38.827
because once you see it,
you can't un-see it!

17:39.506 --> 17:41.211
Some things are best left alone, Georgie.
Robert,

17:41.241 --> 17:42.197
you don't understand!

17:42.227 --> 17:44.645
I can't just sit around and wait for
these investigations to be over.

17:44.675 --> 17:45.937
I have to get there first.

17:46.123 --> 17:47.788
This is the only thing I
have that they don't have.

17:48.347 --> 17:50.971
I will get the family out of the house.
You break into the safe room.

17:51.001 --> 17:53.768
I'm sorry but what part of
"no fucking way" do you not get?

17:53.798 --> 17:56.531
Robert, I need to know if I
made the worst mistake of my life.

18:00.926 --> 18:03.697
And when I get caught,
when it goes "tits up"?

18:05.035 --> 18:08.204
You gonna admit to the family and the
police just how crazy you've become?

18:08.724 --> 18:09.669
You will be fine.

18:16.140 --> 18:18.044
Blue like cornflower.

18:19.496 --> 18:20.455
Azure blue.

18:21.654 --> 18:22.733
Eveclimb blue.

18:24.317 --> 18:25.023
Almost.

18:28.785 --> 18:30.476
My father had one of his paintings.

18:38.253 --> 18:39.439
I like your hair today.

18:45.552 --> 18:46.111
You ok?

18:49.282 --> 18:50.334
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:53.597 --> 18:58.405
We had breakfast together,
all 3 of us, my brothers and me.

18:59.351 --> 19:02.095
and for a moment, I thought
it was nice and then I remembered

19:03.685 --> 19:04.977
never was like that.

19:05.789 --> 19:07.960
We never sat around
the table back then.

19:09.332 --> 19:10.664
I just imagined we did.

19:12.927 --> 19:14.019
Maybe things are better.

19:16.257 --> 19:17.029
Yeah.

19:34.449 --> 19:35.755
It's not just about power,

19:36.740 --> 19:39.204
you have to choose the
appropriate serve for the situation.

19:39.697 --> 19:41.761
respond to what your opponent
puts in front of you.

19:44.138 --> 19:45.762
Nice!
No, it was poor.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.798
I wanted to talk to you
about a venture i'm working on.

19:51.543 --> 19:53.008
New private equity fund.

19:53.895 --> 19:54.828
You're starting a fund?

19:55.667 --> 19:57.332
Sounding out investors
at the moment.

19:58.077 --> 19:59.196
Had a lot of interest already,

19:59.226 --> 20:02.726
It's a business strategy that offers a
great opportunity to generate Alpha returns.

20:02.756 --> 20:04.124
Would you like me to invest

20:04.493 --> 20:08.581
as an early buy-in?
1.5 million Euros, you...

20:08.794 --> 20:10.086
would be a priority client.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.470
You are bloody joking, of course.

20:13.275 --> 20:13.767
No.

20:14.074 --> 20:16.977
There's an investigation into Clio's bank.
Your reputation is shot to shit.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.681
and you're asking me to give you money?
After what Constantine did?

20:20.600 --> 20:22.638
The investigation will clear
my father of any wrongdoing.

20:22.899 --> 20:23.885
That's not what I'm hearing.

20:25.163 --> 20:27.175
Tell me, what was it like
knowing your father was a crook?

20:27.974 --> 20:30.637
Having to carry a secret like that
all these years, quite a burden!

20:32.116 --> 20:33.994
I'm not my father.
No.

20:36.715 --> 20:38.753
He was a crook who
misjudged his opponents.

20:40.205 --> 20:43.175
Serve the same way too
many times, it gets predictable.

20:43.773 --> 20:44.865
They start to see you coming.

20:47.422 --> 20:48.941
Whereas, you're merely a deluded loser,

20:50.020 --> 20:51.644
don't ask my daughter for favors again.

21:22.799 --> 21:25.729
Hey, what's going on.
Are you ok?

21:32.535 --> 21:34.533
So, I was thinking...

21:35.790 --> 21:38.706
what if we all went out
for dinner tonight, all of us?

21:40.278 --> 21:41.956
All of us?
Yeah!

21:42.198 --> 21:44.902
Yeah, why not? When was
the last time we went out?

21:49.297 --> 21:51.255
No. Well, I know
it's not the same but

21:54.635 --> 21:56.899
And Christos won't even come.
He doesn't like you.

21:56.929 --> 21:58.884
Oh, he will, eventually.

22:00.122 --> 22:01.627
We're gonna fix this family, right?

22:02.440 --> 22:03.852
Talk it out, like grownups.

22:05.900 --> 22:06.606
Yeah!

22:08.164 --> 22:08.803
I'm good.

22:14.575 --> 22:17.532
You wanted to update us?
Yes.

22:17.562 --> 22:20.515
Unfortunately, I couldn't
get Christos Clios to talk.

22:20.545 --> 22:23.694
He has an army of lawyers that
could drag this out for years, the prick.

22:23.947 --> 22:27.303
So, myself and the team are
pursuing a different line of enquiry,

22:27.796 --> 22:29.194
the Clios art collection.

22:29.652 --> 22:33.328
We've turned up a number of art
transactions relating to a John Brandeis

22:33.358 --> 22:35.232
that may be of interest.
If you study the...

22:35.379 --> 22:38.522
data illustrations, you see
suggested links between

22:38.552 --> 22:40.685
Brandeis and the Clio family.

22:43.016 --> 22:45.479
And we get to him via Georgina Clios.

22:46.330 --> 22:48.181
You disagree, Commandant Delormes?

22:48.487 --> 22:49.806
People died on that boat.

22:50.525 --> 22:53.082
Forget your pretty pictures
and Georgina Clios.

22:54.134 --> 22:55.839
This girl is the key.

23:00.572 --> 23:01.584
And you've come up with?

23:03.462 --> 23:04.967
John Brandeis is our man.

23:06.371 --> 23:08.675
Getting to Miss Clios is the key.

23:09.794 --> 23:10.366
Excuse me.

23:21.129 --> 23:22.820
<i>You know, I've always had a thing for nurses</i>

23:30.027 --> 23:31.225
<i>Want to make some extra cash?</i>

23:33.942 --> 23:35.674
<i>Of couse you want to.</i>

24:22.959 --> 24:25.010
Christos! Where have you been?

24:25.330 --> 24:27.887
Georgina's taking us out for dinner.
She's given everyone the night off.

24:27.917 --> 24:30.031
Not tonight, I'm busy.
Come on!

24:30.635 --> 24:32.193
It's for the good of the family.

24:32.619 --> 24:34.497
We've got to get out
of the house at some point

24:34.527 --> 24:38.120
show everyone we're pulling together.
I said no!

24:38.666 --> 24:40.904
If nothing else,
it'll keep Georgina happy.

24:41.407 --> 24:45.296
Adam, I really don't give a fuck
about that bitch's happiness

24:46.042 --> 24:46.947
Don't call her that.

24:49.211 --> 24:51.476
You think you're hurting
more than the rest of us?

24:51.750 --> 24:54.919
Or is it that jump-up execs
don't like taking orders?

24:55.958 --> 24:58.875
Let me tell you something, little brother,

24:59.741 --> 25:01.978
The only reason you got
where you are is Daddy.

25:02.008 --> 25:03.801
and he's not here any...
Stop it!

25:07.717 --> 25:10.993
Just for the sake of one dinner,
can't we put our usual bullshit aside?

25:13.063 --> 25:13.969
Fine.

25:16.819 --> 25:19.163
9PM! Don't be late!

26:15.369 --> 26:18.246
Robert, we're about to leave.
You've got three hours.

26:20.963 --> 26:22.162
So, how's your novel going?

26:23.147 --> 26:24.799
Fine, it's...umm

26:25.859 --> 26:26.645
it's going fine.

26:26.675 --> 26:27.964
You mean you're actually
writing something?

26:28.270 --> 26:31.613
Christos!
Sorry, go ahead.

26:32.199 --> 26:34.777
It explores the negative
impact of marketization

26:34.877 --> 26:37.007
on contemporary human relationships.

26:37.286 --> 26:39.057
Hm, sounds great.
Hm.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.922
Yeah, sounds like a real page turner.

26:42.587 --> 26:43.146
Yeah.

26:45.561 --> 26:48.025
You know what? Your dad told me
that he used to take you here as kids.

26:48.055 --> 26:49.983
Really?
Yeah, he did, when

26:50.013 --> 26:51.515
Mother wanted us out of her hair.

26:51.545 --> 26:53.859
Kind of stuffy, you know.
Well,

26:54.130 --> 26:55.248
Dad liked the wine list.

26:56.274 --> 26:59.484
Wine list...
that's not why we came.

26:59.910 --> 27:03.320
Yeah... and he fancied one
of the friend-of-the house girls.

27:03.350 --> 27:05.537
No way!
Oh, yes.

27:05.763 --> 27:09.359
He's have them set the table,
check baby Adam with his coat

27:09.389 --> 27:10.079
Shut up!

27:10.109 --> 27:12.250
then he would go to
one of the private rooms

27:12.423 --> 27:13.755
with the girl...
Christos!

27:13.785 --> 27:17.382
No, no, it's ok.
I want to know these things.

27:17.412 --> 27:18.182
Why?

27:20.646 --> 27:22.111
Because I'm a masochist.

27:41.324 --> 27:44.853
Were there other women like that?
I mean, more recently.

27:45.306 --> 27:47.530
You mean:
since you were married?

27:48.116 --> 27:50.647
No, he wasn't having an affair.
I would have noticed.

27:51.021 --> 27:53.272
I don't think so.
Christos,

27:54.937 --> 27:57.654
can't we talk about something else?
Sure!

27:58.652 --> 28:01.210
How about the safe room?
Safe room?

28:01.677 --> 28:04.567
Dad's den. That place
he had fitted in the basement.

28:04.713 --> 28:06.605
Oh, yeah! Well,
Christos has been in there.

28:06.884 --> 28:09.069
Christos is the
only one who can go in there.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.506
He's the only one with the code.
Yeah!

28:11.885 --> 28:15.042
Come to think of it,
you use it a lot.

28:15.668 --> 28:18.372
What do you do in there?
Answer the question, Christos.

28:19.104 --> 28:21.009
She is head of the family, after all.

28:21.182 --> 28:22.407
Head of the family?

28:23.404 --> 28:24.882
Mother, you made it!

28:54.671 --> 28:56.296
You weren't expecting me.

28:58.989 --> 29:01.093
We're all telling Georgina
what we know about Father.

29:01.493 --> 29:03.251
All fun for all the family.

29:05.186 --> 29:08.210
More fun than the
will reading, in any case.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.287
Well, I thought the
will reading was great fun.

29:11.193 --> 29:13.790
Who doesn't like being
threatened by law enforcement!

29:14.394 --> 29:16.832
What do you think, Christos?
What would you recommend?

29:20.638 --> 29:22.169
No, no. Something special.
Ah.

29:23.541 --> 29:26.484
Ah, of course, the '73 Romanee Conte.

29:26.514 --> 29:27.763
Very good, sir.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.447
8,000 Euros.
Bring it!

29:31.477 --> 29:32.256
Of course

29:32.938 --> 29:34.989
Liquidating what's left
of the pound assets, then?

29:37.629 --> 29:40.852
What? Only the best for us?
Well, we do have to be careful.

29:40.882 --> 29:42.077
Why come here, then?

29:42.107 --> 29:46.286
You could have shopped at Garfour
and cooked us all some hamburgers.

30:00.807 --> 30:02.551
Don't fucking decant it, just...

30:05.175 --> 30:08.465
You know, this Domain is overrated, it
doesn't warrant this kind of markup.

30:08.934 --> 30:10.199
Want a fucking discount?

30:10.229 --> 30:12.610
You wouldn't have the balls to
act like this if Dad were still here.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.287
Well, if Dad was still here,
I wouldn't need a fucking discount.

30:15.317 --> 30:17.977
I want a fucking discount!
Réduction, s'il vous plaît!

30:18.007 --> 30:20.037
I want to go home.
Réduction, s'il vous plaît!

30:20.067 --> 30:20.729
Can I come with you?

30:20.759 --> 30:23.952
Ada, I think it's better if you
go home with your Mom tonight.

30:25.025 --> 30:28.088
No! I want to come with you.

30:28.541 --> 30:31.817
Georgie, please let me come with you.
Ok, ok.

30:36.863 --> 30:38.607
Whose lucky night is it, then?

30:47.103 --> 30:50.299
Fuck this place!
Fuck you all!

30:58.857 --> 31:00.854
Yeah.
Are you in yet?

31:01.054 --> 31:03.345
No, I need more time.
The meal's over.

31:03.375 --> 31:05.849
What? How long have I got?
They're leaving now.

31:07.012 --> 31:08.810
Ok, it'll be ok.

31:19.569 --> 31:21.193
Christos, Christos! Can I...

32:19.067 --> 32:20.745
Hey, get up.

32:21.730 --> 32:22.370
Solte!

32:30.393 --> 32:33.736
Your mother was grateful
for the favor I did her.

32:33.766 --> 32:38.584
Moving the Ingresko account to Clios Bank
when other investors were running scared.

32:38.614 --> 32:41.056
Yeah, I know.
I'm sure she was.

32:42.029 --> 32:44.546
Well, that makes us
business partners now

32:45.043 --> 32:49.625
and as such, I'm going to offer
you some partnerly advice...

32:50.091 --> 32:52.062
Quit while you're ahead.

32:53.452 --> 32:57.395
Yeah, um, I'm not done yet.

32:58.114 --> 33:02.616
In fact, since you're so
keen to hand out favors,

33:03.374 --> 33:05.678
I want to increase the house maximum bet.

33:05.708 --> 33:08.368
Ah, favors are for
your mother, not for you.

33:08.398 --> 33:11.365
Right. You're gonna regret that.

33:11.395 --> 33:14.663
Really? And why is that?

33:15.329 --> 33:18.672
Well, Interpol has frozen
all the bank's assets.

33:20.745 --> 33:21.904
Or you haven't heard?

33:23.702 --> 33:26.312
Yeah, all that money that you put in?

33:28.323 --> 33:29.522
Good luck getting it all back.

33:47.659 --> 33:50.203
Adriana...
I should have told you I invited Mum.

33:50.233 --> 33:51.815
It's ok, really, I'm...

33:52.841 --> 33:54.773
I'm just sorry it had to go that way.

33:55.425 --> 33:59.567
It;s not your fault.
We just messed up.

33:59.780 --> 34:03.443
Every family is messed up in their own way.
Not this bad.

34:06.195 --> 34:10.123
It was nice of you to try, though.
You really didn't have to.

34:12.672 --> 34:15.589
What's your family like?
It was just me and my Dad.

34:15.619 --> 34:18.186
You don't talk much about your Dad.
He passed away.

34:19.829 --> 34:22.545
Sorry.
It wasn't easy for him,

34:22.985 --> 34:24.797
raising a daughter alone.

34:26.196 --> 34:29.005
One time he took me to the
Philadelphia Museum Of Art

34:29.579 --> 34:32.549
and left me there because
he couldn't afford a babysitter.

34:32.579 --> 34:34.280
Really?
Yes, really.

34:34.958 --> 34:35.905
I was 12

34:36.504 --> 34:38.621
but I spent the whole afternoon
looking at a Monet.

34:39.346 --> 34:41.744
At the most beautiful thing
I had ever seen.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.446
So, in some ways, I guess
he gave me my love of art.

34:46.791 --> 34:48.683
I'll always be grateful to him for that.

35:02.279 --> 35:07.447
<i>20 to 19 at the bank, Blackjack.
The House wins.</i>

35:22.778 --> 35:24.070
<i>He's really going for it.</i>

35:25.015 --> 35:26.907
<i>He wants to bet his Lamborghini.</i>

35:28.505 --> 35:29.783
<i>What do you think we should do?</i>

35:31.563 --> 35:32.415
<i>Will you accept?</i>

35:34.932 --> 35:35.878
<i>Let him do it.</i>

35:51.165 --> 35:52.204
Thanks for the ride.

35:53.067 --> 35:56.743
Oh, if you ever want to talk, I'm here.
Ok.

36:00.219 --> 36:01.258
Is something wrong?

36:03.083 --> 36:05.653
No, no, it's just been a long day.

36:08.184 --> 36:09.489
<i>How much is he in for?</i>

36:09.519 --> 36:12.579
<i>$ 420,000
You sure about that?</i>

36:13.786 --> 36:16.756
<i>We could call his mother.
No.</i>

36:18.941 --> 36:21.191
<i>Let him go for broke.</i>

36:24.234 --> 36:27.590
You're good at this, you know.
You should have kids.

36:29.561 --> 36:33.264
Can you stay with me until I fall asleep?
Sure.

36:49.673 --> 36:50.925
Sweet dreams.

36:51.657 --> 36:53.522
Thank you, you too.

36:58.404 --> 37:00.416
Place your bets, ladies and
gentlemen, place your bets.

37:02.293 --> 37:05.010
Place your bets.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.776
It's way past his bedtime.

37:10.681 --> 37:11.800
I'll deal with him.

37:14.568 --> 37:15.420
Christos!

37:17.431 --> 37:18.750
Hey, what are you doing here?

37:18.780 --> 37:20.694
I figured this place might be on the list.

37:21.094 --> 37:24.104
What are you doing?
I'm reviving our fortunes.

37:24.134 --> 37:26.710
A chip, my chip.

37:29.813 --> 37:32.450
Can't you close this down?
The wager's legit.

37:33.787 --> 37:34.692
You pig!

37:38.142 --> 37:39.247
I need more credit.

37:39.465 --> 37:41.516
How did you become
Vice President of anything?

37:41.729 --> 37:43.727
Because he believed in me.
Adam!

37:43.757 --> 37:45.698
I want to know, you
got some cash on you?

37:46.058 --> 37:48.708
Come on, bro!
Maybe it's not your night.

37:50.118 --> 37:50.837
Come on.

37:52.635 --> 37:55.738
Of course it's my night, ok?
I know what I'm doing.

38:37.569 --> 38:39.088
Who the fuck is that?

38:40.593 --> 38:41.938
Is he alright?

38:42.244 --> 38:45.041
Our sleeping beauty's going
to regret this one in the morning.

38:45.827 --> 38:47.012
Of to his hidey hole.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.363
Oh, no, no, no,no you don't.

38:49.393 --> 38:50.842
Get off me!
Christos!

38:53.710 --> 38:54.403
Fine!

38:58.731 --> 39:00.769
Here.
There you go.

39:09.515 --> 39:13.017
Right, well, I'm going to go to bed.
Me too.

39:15.114 --> 39:16.872
Good night.
Good night.

39:54.703 --> 39:56.314
You never did have any class.

39:59.024 --> 40:01.115
Business is business, Irina.

40:02.620 --> 40:05.896
How much is he in for?
Six hundred thousand.

40:09.568 --> 40:10.674
He doesn't have that.

40:13.724 --> 40:15.602
What is this really about, Jakob?

40:16.964 --> 40:19.295
I know about the asset freeze.

40:23.264 --> 40:26.767
So your punishing Christos to punish me?
No.

40:28.456 --> 40:30.254
I'm entitled to be angry.

40:30.627 --> 40:34.024
When you took my account, you
knew the authorities were coming.

40:34.530 --> 40:35.062
You did.

40:35.222 --> 40:37.247
I didn't know about the investigation.

40:39.103 --> 40:43.205
but this is what I do know.
I know your investment is safe.

40:45.176 --> 40:48.146
And I know the investigation will end
because it will get to nowhere.

40:50.540 --> 40:53.057
Constantine's dealings were
as murky as the sea.

40:53.114 --> 40:54.682
They'll never get to the bottom of it.

40:57.505 --> 40:59.916
Everything my husband did,
everything he said

41:01.715 --> 41:03.979
was intended to obscure the truth,

41:05.897 --> 41:09.200
to make bad things sound good.

41:11.465 --> 41:12.477
In his world,

41:14.222 --> 41:15.660
up was down,

41:16.100 --> 41:17.631
black was white,

41:19.421 --> 41:21.512
and the Bank was merely

41:23.856 --> 41:25.294
leveraged.

41:29.105 --> 41:34.433
But in the end, "leveraged"
was just a respectable word

41:35.179 --> 41:36.031
for debted

41:38.840 --> 41:40.478
and debt is bad.

42:22.076 --> 42:23.208
I'm alive.

42:24.620 --> 42:25.699
Should I be dead?

42:27.643 --> 42:28.535
<i>I want to meet.</i>

42:40.685 --> 42:43.375
Hello, this is Robert. Please leave
a message and I'll get back to you.

43:02.708 --> 43:04.453
What? What is it?

43:04.679 --> 43:07.103
The six hundred thousand,
it disappears.

43:07.316 --> 43:08.448
What?

43:10.998 --> 43:11.917
Cara!

43:45.125 --> 43:48.507
<b> <i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i> </b>

43:48.537 --> 43:52.223
<b> <i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i> </b>

43:52.253 --> 43:55.920
<b> <i>I tiptoe right round my baby</i> </b>

43:55.950 --> 43:59.690
<b> <i>All this world is mad, mad crazy</i> </b>
