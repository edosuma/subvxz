WEBVTT

01:34.954 --> 01:37.924
Gather around, everyone.
Please, Doris, Diane.

01:37.957 --> 01:39.926
With this being Judy's last
morning with us,

01:39.959 --> 01:42.929
I was thinking it'd be nice
if we could go around the room

01:42.962 --> 01:46.531
and say what we appreciate most about her.
I'll start us off.

01:46.565 --> 01:47.566
Scott, you really don't need
to...

01:47.967 --> 01:48.968
Your scones.

01:49.769 --> 01:52.972
Judy, your scones are truly a
revelation.

01:53.371 --> 01:58.945
One bite, one crumb can send me places
I never before dreamt I could go.

01:59.344 --> 02:06.953
Your flavor combinations are so refined
and, excuse my language, freakin' electric.

02:08.955 --> 02:12.925
Look at me here.
I'm babbling on and on.

02:12.959 --> 02:14.961
Doris, is there something you'd
like to say?

02:15.560 --> 02:16.361
Sure.

02:16.996 --> 02:22.935
Well, Judy, even though I wouldn't
feed your macaroons to my dogs.

02:22.969 --> 02:27.940
I still respect your work ethic and
don't wish you any specific harm.

02:30.977 --> 02:33.946
I am so sorry to cut this short.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.614
Doris, a moving tribute.

02:35.648 --> 02:39.952
I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity
to work alongside each one of you.

02:40.352 --> 02:45.958
But I have to go now.
My planet needs me. Bye.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.967
I thought her scones were shit.

02:55.768 --> 02:58.938
Gary, come on, dude. That's all
wrong, dude.

02:58.971 --> 03:01.974
The Quilt Queens? And the P...
whose P is that? Why is there a P...

03:02.975 --> 03:04.342
Amir.

03:04.376 --> 03:07.980
Judy, hi. As you can see,
we're busy today so what do you want?

03:08.981 --> 03:09.982
As promised.

03:10.983 --> 03:11.951
Okay. I'll listen to it.

03:11.984 --> 03:12.985
Okay.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.928
What? What? Why are you still
here?

03:21.961 --> 03:26.933
Oh, uh. I see Shark Dick just
dropped off the Queef Queens show.

03:26.966 --> 03:28.935
Very perceptive. What gave that
away?

03:28.968 --> 03:32.939
Have you found a replacement opener yet?
Will there be a replacement?

03:32.972 --> 03:34.941
I don't know. I don't know.

03:34.974 --> 03:36.943
Well, you know, we could open.

03:36.976 --> 03:39.946
Listen. I just, it's not a good idea.
I don't think that's...

03:39.979 --> 03:41.147
Amir, please.

03:41.180 --> 03:44.951
You said we needed something
recorded, so we made a demo.

03:44.984 --> 03:48.120
You said we needed some experience, so
we are about to embark on our first tour.

03:48.154 --> 03:51.991
Can you please, just please, listen to
the tape before you make a decision?

03:53.993 --> 03:55.962
Fine, fine. Just leave.

03:55.995 --> 03:56.963
Okay.

03:56.996 --> 03:58.264
Just go.

03:58.297 --> 03:59.999
All right. I'll call you later
today to see what you think.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.935
If you call me before Friday
morning, I'm going to burn the demo.

04:02.969 --> 04:04.937
All right. Friday morning it is.

04:04.971 --> 04:05.938
Goodbye.

04:05.972 --> 04:06.973
Kay. Hi.

04:08.975 --> 04:10.977
Go. Leave.

04:13.980 --> 04:14.981
Yes!

04:51.984 --> 04:52.952
Morning.

04:52.985 --> 04:54.586
It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

04:55.988 --> 04:58.991
Mel. Mel!

05:00.592 --> 05:04.964
This place is still a sty. I thought you
two were gonna clean it while I was gone.

05:04.997 --> 05:06.999
I had to replace all my drum
heads.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.568
I started to clean

05:10.602 --> 05:12.972
but then I needed to get high
cause I hate cleaning.

05:13.005 --> 05:16.008
But then I got tired
cause weed makes me sleepy.

05:16.809 --> 05:18.978
Then I needed to sleep, so I
slept.

05:19.011 --> 05:22.014
I'm sorry.

05:23.015 --> 05:24.984
Band meeting. Kitchen.

05:26.986 --> 05:29.587
Let's go. Up, up, up!

05:31.991 --> 05:42.001
Okay. So... jobs quit, bags packed, merch
boxed, guitars strung, drum heads replaced.

05:44.003 --> 05:46.005
Tour route mapped.

05:47.605 --> 05:53.980
Six shows, seven days, with the possibility
of a seventh show back here with...

05:54.013 --> 05:56.015
Mel, drum roll, please.

06:02.021 --> 06:04.991
The Queef Queens.

06:05.024 --> 06:05.992
The House of Independents show?

06:06.025 --> 06:07.960
The very same.

06:07.994 --> 06:08.961
Shutup.

06:08.995 --> 06:10.363
No way.

06:10.396 --> 06:12.965
Yes, way. And we all know who
drums for the Queef Queens, right?

06:12.999 --> 06:13.966
No.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.968
Yes. Jenn Jennings.

06:16.002 --> 06:18.971
And we all know Jenn Jennings'
claim to fame, right?

06:19.005 --> 06:20.006
No.

06:22.008 --> 06:23.042
Also, no.

06:23.075 --> 06:26.012
She is owner, operator of
Alliteration Records.

06:26.812 --> 06:28.981
Oh, man. Alliteration has such
an awesome roster of bands.

06:29.015 --> 06:30.582
Yeah.

06:30.615 --> 06:35.021
In the past year alone, they've put out
the Brain Busters LP, the Acid Cat EP,

06:35.421 --> 06:38.623
and two seven inches from Turd
Toilet.

06:39.025 --> 06:41.994
And the soon to be released
debut album from DUH.

06:42.028 --> 06:44.030
Precisely.

06:45.031 --> 06:46.999
We open for the Queef Queens.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.969
Jenn Jennings sees us, Jenn
Jennings loves us.

06:50.002 --> 06:51.971
I give Jenn Jennings our demo.

06:52.004 --> 06:54.974
Jenn Jennings offers us a record
deal.

06:55.007 --> 06:56.976
We no longer have to work shit
jobs

06:57.009 --> 07:00.980
and we just get to tour and make
music for the rest of our lives.

07:01.013 --> 07:03.615
Fuckin' A. Yeah!

07:04.016 --> 07:09.021
I wouldn't celebrate just yet,
or ever.

07:11.023 --> 07:14.627
Life has a way of dangling these
small carrots of opportunity

07:15.027 --> 07:16.028
in front of our faces,

07:16.829 --> 07:20.032
ready to completely destroy and
dismantle any hope in sight.

07:20.833 --> 07:30.009
The world is chaos. And, though
together, we are alone to suffer.

07:37.016 --> 07:41.020
Okay. Everybody up. Up, c'mon.

07:44.023 --> 07:50.029
We're going on tour, yeah! We're going
on tour, yeah! We're going on tour, yeah!

08:03.042 --> 08:05.010
Okay. Max.

08:05.044 --> 08:09.014
I don't want us to look like a bunch
of amateurs on our very first tour,

08:09.048 --> 08:11.984
so let's practice some stage
banter.

08:12.017 --> 08:12.985
Right now?

08:13.018 --> 08:13.986
Yes.

08:14.019 --> 08:14.987
Why?

08:15.020 --> 08:16.021
Because you suck at talking.

08:17.022 --> 08:18.991
Mm-hm. Let's role play.

08:19.024 --> 08:21.994
Pretend we just finished our
first song.

08:22.027 --> 08:23.028
What would you say?

08:25.030 --> 08:29.034
Okay. Uh... hi, I'm Max and I'm
here to say, uh

08:29.835 --> 08:34.006
we're in the band DUH,
and we're playing right now.

08:34.039 --> 08:38.010
And, um... we hope you all like
music...

08:38.043 --> 08:42.014
Um... our music, uh, cause,
you know, music's special, um,

08:42.047 --> 08:46.018
and you're special
for being here with us tonight.

08:46.051 --> 08:46.852
Okay. Please stop.

08:46.886 --> 08:49.021
Why? What's wrong with
that... Whoa!

08:53.058 --> 08:54.994
Yikes.

08:55.027 --> 08:57.997
Aw. Jesus, Max. Are you okay?

08:58.030 --> 09:00.032
Yeah, all good. Face broke the
fall.

09:01.033 --> 09:05.037
Aw.
Now, where is the van?

09:06.038 --> 09:12.044
Huh. Uh... oh, I see it.

09:15.047 --> 09:16.048
Shit.

09:16.849 --> 09:19.018
No, no, no. Stop!
Do not get in that van! I'm coming!

09:19.051 --> 09:21.020
That's weird. Do we know those
guys?

09:21.053 --> 09:23.055
The van's getting repoed,
dumbass.

09:23.856 --> 09:27.059
Please, don't!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:29.061 --> 09:31.030
Goddammit!

09:31.063 --> 09:34.033
My one-hitter was in there.
Fuck.

09:34.066 --> 09:36.001
Why is this happening?

09:36.035 --> 09:42.041
Guys, we can fix this.
We can. I think. Probably.

09:44.043 --> 09:49.048
I warned us last night.
The world is cruel and unforgiving.

09:52.051 --> 09:52.851
Shit.

09:53.519 --> 09:58.023
Now that I think about it, the
creditors were calling a lot last week.

09:58.057 --> 10:00.025
Fuuuuuuu...

10:18.043 --> 10:21.013
Okay. Last one.

10:21.046 --> 10:23.048
Say a little prayer.

10:33.058 --> 10:35.060
Now, the waiting game.

10:37.062 --> 10:38.030
Hey!

10:38.063 --> 10:39.031
Keep walking.

10:39.064 --> 10:41.066
Hey, is this you?

10:44.069 --> 10:47.039
You the kids that just tagged my
windshield?

10:47.072 --> 10:49.074
Uh... yes.

10:49.875 --> 10:55.047
That is my property.
You are soliciting on private property.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.049
We're sorry, sir.

10:57.082 --> 10:58.050
Mm-hm.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.052
Now, what's the meaning of this?

11:00.853 --> 11:04.056
Okay. We didn't know you were in
there, so I'll just take this...

11:07.059 --> 11:09.028
Now, what do you guys need a van
for?

11:09.061 --> 11:11.063
Cause of the man, man.

11:13.065 --> 11:18.037
Yeah. And we need it pronto
so that our band can go on tour.

11:18.070 --> 11:19.038
You guys are in a band?

11:19.071 --> 11:20.072
Yeah.

11:21.073 --> 11:23.042
Oh shit. You guys rip?

11:23.075 --> 11:26.045
Well, I believe we do. Yeah.

11:26.078 --> 11:27.079
Oh. Right on.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.083
Well, does that mean
that we can borrow your van?

11:33.085 --> 11:34.086
Well, no.

11:35.689 --> 11:44.063
Full disclosure, that van back there also
happens to be my home for the moment.

11:44.863 --> 11:49.034
You see, in this cut-throat,
capitalistic world in which we now live,

11:49.068 --> 11:52.071
your boy has fallen on hard
times.

11:54.473 --> 11:58.077
The game is rigged and I am but
a casualty.

11:58.477 --> 12:00.079
A victim.

12:02.081 --> 12:03.082
But I am hopeful.

12:27.072 --> 12:31.076
Hey. I can drive y'all.

12:33.078 --> 12:37.049
I can roadie, too. I mean, every
touring band needs a roadie. Don't they?

12:37.082 --> 12:42.054
Ju... just throw me a few bucks
and pay for gas and what-not.

12:42.087 --> 12:46.091
Well, we could leave right now.
What do you say?

13:06.078 --> 13:11.049
Um, not that I care, but who is
the man driving the mystery van?

13:11.083 --> 13:14.052
Oh. That's, um...

13:14.086 --> 13:16.054
Sorry, I didn't get your name.

13:16.088 --> 13:18.056
My name's Peckerhead.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.091
What?

13:20.092 --> 13:23.095
Peck-er-head.

13:24.096 --> 13:26.064
That is not your name.

13:26.098 --> 13:30.102
Well, that is what my daddy
called me til the day he died.

13:30.502 --> 13:33.071
Peckerhead's giving us a ride in
his van.

13:33.105 --> 13:37.109
You can call me Peck.
My friends call me Peck.

13:37.911 --> 13:40.078
I'll stick with Peckerhead.
Thanks.

13:40.112 --> 13:42.114
Ladies' choice.

13:42.916 --> 13:48.086
Well, Peck, on behalf of the entire band,
it is wonderful to have you on board.

13:49.087 --> 13:51.089
And now it's tour time.

13:58.096 --> 13:59.097
Hey.

14:25.524 --> 14:30.062
Hey. Uh, we're running a little late
and I don't wanna piss off the promoter.

14:30.095 --> 14:33.065
Any chance you could go, I don't
know, like,

14:33.098 --> 14:36.068
ten miles above the speed limit
when we're back on the road?

14:36.101 --> 14:37.937
I'm afraid not, Judy pie.

14:37.971 --> 14:45.110
You see, this highway is teeming with patrolmen
who wouldn't take kindly to a bunch of punks.

15:12.104 --> 15:15.107
Yo. Find anything, detective?

15:19.111 --> 15:20.112
All aboard.

15:35.127 --> 15:36.128
Locked?

15:40.132 --> 15:42.134
Glad we hauled ass.

15:43.135 --> 15:45.103
I thought load-in was at 5:00?

15:45.137 --> 15:46.138
That's what the promoter said.

16:01.921 --> 16:06.124
So, how did you guys come up
with the name DUH?

16:06.926 --> 16:10.128
Uh, James Taylor was already
taken.

16:49.936 --> 16:52.137
Someone's here.

17:00.947 --> 17:03.548
Um, hello, sir.

17:06.953 --> 17:08.153
You with the band?

17:08.954 --> 17:11.924
Uh, yeah. Judy. Hi.

17:11.958 --> 17:13.925
Uh, we spoke over the phone.

17:15.928 --> 17:16.929
Okay.

17:20.933 --> 17:21.867
Anything else I can help you
with?

17:21.901 --> 17:27.906
Um... well, uh, should we start
to load in?

17:27.940 --> 17:28.941
Sure. Whatever.

17:29.942 --> 17:31.576
It's not like there's a rush.

17:31.610 --> 17:34.947
Sound guy doesn't get her til 9:00 and,
uh, you're the only band booked tonight.

17:35.748 --> 17:38.951
What? I thought this was a
showcase.

17:39.752 --> 17:42.955
Uh, yeah. And your band is being
showcased.

17:44.957 --> 17:46.926
How much material do you have
prepared?

17:46.959 --> 17:49.962
Can you handle three hours with
a 15 minute break between sets?

17:50.763 --> 17:55.902
Uh... we have 20 minutes
of original material.

17:55.935 --> 17:59.906
22 with a Misfits cover.

17:59.939 --> 18:01.941
Are you kidding me?

18:08.748 --> 18:11.550
I don't know where we're
supposed to plug in.

18:13.953 --> 18:14.954
Whoa!

18:16.956 --> 18:18.958
(SOUND GUY)
I didn't say to stop, drummer.

18:19.959 --> 18:20.827
(SOUND GUY)
Stop!

18:20.860 --> 18:22.962
(SOUND GUY)
Alright, bass, you're up.

18:24.964 --> 18:27.566
(SOUND GUY)
We check vocal mics first.

18:27.967 --> 18:31.938
Test. One, two, three.
Test. One, two, three. Test.

18:31.971 --> 18:35.942
Uh, yeah. Can I just get a little
bit more of her in my monitor?

18:35.975 --> 18:36.976
I can't hear anything.

18:37.744 --> 18:40.913
Um... test. One, two.
Test. One, two.

18:40.947 --> 18:41.914
Uh, yeah...

18:53.960 --> 18:56.963
Hey, just remember what we
worked on. Okay?

18:57.964 --> 18:58.965
You got this.

19:06.973 --> 19:07.940
Hi. Uh...

19:11.978 --> 19:14.981
Fuck it. Let's just play.

19:51.984 --> 19:53.552
What's this?

19:53.585 --> 19:54.586
Your cut.

19:54.987 --> 19:56.989
It's three dollars.

19:57.389 --> 19:58.991
Yeah, a dollar a head.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.929
What the fuck am I gonna do with
three dollars?

20:02.962 --> 20:05.965
I don't know.
Invest in a better band? See ya.

20:14.974 --> 20:15.975
Careful.

20:18.978 --> 20:22.982
Well, I thought y'all did just
great.

20:24.984 --> 20:26.986
How much cash we rake in?

20:32.992 --> 20:33.993
Shutup.

20:34.794 --> 20:36.963
Like, what's the point of paying
us at all?

20:36.996 --> 20:40.967
That brings our total funds to
$11.

20:41.000 --> 20:41.968
Great. We're screwed.

20:42.001 --> 20:43.069
Mm-hm.

20:43.102 --> 20:45.972
I guess we have to take justice
into our own hands.

20:46.973 --> 20:48.975
Stand down, McClane.

20:50.977 --> 20:51.978
Fuck.

20:52.778 --> 20:55.982
(MEL)
Chaos, man. Fucking chaos.

21:02.989 --> 21:05.992
Hey, what time is it?

21:06.391 --> 21:07.994
Almost midnight.

21:08.995 --> 21:10.963
Let's just get out of here. Hmm?

21:10.997 --> 21:11.998
Yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.970
I'm just gonna use the bathroom
before we hit the road.

21:18.004 --> 21:22.008
Yeah. Make sure you piss and shit
all over while you're in there.

21:23.009 --> 21:24.010
Roger that.

21:25.978 --> 21:28.580
Just wash your hands.

21:36.989 --> 21:38.991
Man. Peck must be going to town
in there.

21:51.003 --> 21:53.005
Should I poop, too?

22:00.012 --> 22:02.014
Hello?

22:36.015 --> 22:38.017
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

22:40.019 --> 22:42.021
Get in the van. We're leaving.

22:46.025 --> 22:47.960
What is it?

22:47.994 --> 22:48.928
Where are the keys to the van?

22:48.961 --> 22:50.997
I don't know.
I think Peck has them. Why?

22:52.999 --> 22:56.969
Oh, hey. Uh, what are y'all
carrying on about?

22:57.003 --> 22:58.603
Stay the fuck back!

22:59.005 --> 23:00.973
Whoa. What the fuck is going on?

23:01.007 --> 23:02.975
Oh, no. It's all right.
It's all right.

23:03.009 --> 23:06.979
You know, Judy just got spooked
because

23:07.013 --> 23:09.982
she caught me roughing up
that promoter man back there.

23:10.016 --> 23:11.984
- He killed him.
- What?

23:12.018 --> 23:14.020
He's a fucking monster.

23:14.420 --> 23:16.989
Now, let's not resort to
name-calling.

23:17.023 --> 23:20.592
Did you really kill the promoter?
Is that true?

23:20.626 --> 23:21.994
Yes!

23:22.028 --> 23:23.996
Of course not.

23:24.030 --> 23:25.998
Then why the fuck would she say
that?

23:26.032 --> 23:27.565
Hell if I know.

23:27.599 --> 23:32.972
All I wanted was just to give him
one good pop before we hit the road.

23:33.005 --> 23:35.975
There were pieces of him everywhere.
He's dead.

23:36.008 --> 23:36.976
Oh, I beg to differ.

23:37.009 --> 23:39.979
He is very much alive.

23:40.012 --> 23:42.114
I saw it. He was eating him
and...

23:42.148 --> 23:43.315
He's alive.

23:43.349 --> 23:43.983
Dead.

23:44.016 --> 23:44.984
Alive.

23:45.017 --> 23:45.985
Dead.

23:46.018 --> 23:47.987
Alive.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.990
D-E-A-D.

23:51.023 --> 23:53.025
All right, everyone. Shut up!

23:59.031 --> 24:03.035
Okay. I'm gonna go check it out.

24:09.041 --> 24:11.010
Okay. Wait.

24:15.014 --> 24:18.017
You may not want to go in there.

24:23.022 --> 24:25.024
Eww.

24:27.026 --> 24:29.028
Y'all said he had it coming.

24:32.031 --> 24:34.033
Where's his head?

24:45.044 --> 24:47.046
Goddamn.

24:53.819 --> 24:56.989
All right, y'all. C'mon.
We gotta hit the road soon.

24:57.022 --> 25:01.026
We got other towns to rock and
what-not.

25:02.027 --> 25:05.030
We need to get his keys and go.

25:07.032 --> 25:08.033
Okay.

25:09.034 --> 25:10.636
Guys?

25:21.046 --> 25:24.049
It's really fucked up in there.

25:27.052 --> 25:28.654
Where's the key to the van?

25:32.057 --> 25:38.998
Oh! Now I'll admit, an explanation
is owed but that is my van out there.

25:39.031 --> 25:41.433
Now let me buy you some dinner

25:41.834 --> 25:45.004
and then if you still feel that
I'm in the wrong,

25:45.037 --> 25:50.042
we can unload your stuff
and go our separate ways.

25:55.047 --> 25:56.048
Mmm?

25:57.049 --> 25:58.450
No.

26:13.465 --> 26:18.437
Go ahead. Eat up.
It's... it's on me.

26:24.043 --> 26:28.047
I guess I should open with an
apology.

26:31.050 --> 26:32.051
I'm sorry.

26:35.054 --> 26:38.023
I'm sorry I murdered the hell
out of that promoter man

26:38.057 --> 26:41.060
before I had the chance to run
it by y'all.

26:45.064 --> 26:50.069
And I guess I should have been more
forthcoming about my condition.

26:50.869 --> 26:54.073
And exactly what condition would that
be, Peckerhead?

26:57.076 --> 27:07.086
Well, every night at midnight
I turn into some <i>thing.</i>

27:10.055 --> 27:14.059
Now I don't know what that <i>thing</i>
is.

27:14.860 --> 27:19.031
I honestly can't remember
how or when it started,

27:19.064 --> 27:23.068
but it only lasts for thirteen
minutes.

27:24.069 --> 27:25.070
And then I'm fine.

27:26.071 --> 27:30.042
Fine? You killed and ate a man.

27:30.075 --> 27:32.077
Please, keep it down.

27:36.081 --> 27:39.084
Okay. I did, yes.

27:39.852 --> 27:45.457
Right. And, uh, who's to say it
wouldn't be one of us next time?

27:45.858 --> 27:48.027
One of my band mates?
Shit, no.

27:48.060 --> 27:51.063
I... I am in complete control.

27:52.064 --> 27:54.033
Control. Okay.

27:54.066 --> 27:57.036
Hey, Peck, do you have diabetes.

27:57.069 --> 27:58.070
No, why?

27:59.071 --> 28:01.073
I thought so.

28:02.474 --> 28:04.043
What's that?

28:04.076 --> 28:07.079
You know exactly what this is.

28:07.913 --> 28:12.084
I found this in his glove
compartment earlier today.

28:13.085 --> 28:15.054
So you're on smack, too.

28:15.087 --> 28:18.090
Aw Peck. Say it ain't so.

28:19.091 --> 28:20.326
Now, now hold the phone.

28:20.359 --> 28:25.064
You think that, that I use
this for shooting dope? Hardly.

28:25.864 --> 28:30.035
How do you think I control this
thing, huh?

28:30.069 --> 28:36.041
I use this to sedate myself every
night to keep the beast at bay.

28:36.075 --> 28:36.909
Sorry.

28:36.942 --> 28:41.046
Why wasn't the beast kept at bay
tonight?

28:41.080 --> 28:44.049
For, for one thing
I didn't think it was right

28:44.083 --> 28:48.053
for some joker to take advantage
of my friends like that.

28:48.087 --> 28:52.224
And when I saw how worried Judy
was about getting to the next show,

28:52.257 --> 28:58.097
what with lack of funds for gas and
food, well, I had to do something.

28:59.098 --> 29:02.101
So I stuck up for all of us.

29:03.068 --> 29:05.037
By eating him.

29:05.070 --> 29:09.041
I realize that some might think
that that's an extreme response,

29:09.074 --> 29:12.077
but how else were we gonna to
get paid?

29:13.078 --> 29:15.047
Well, we didn't get paid, so.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.081
Yeah.

29:20.085 --> 29:23.088
Au contraire.

29:26.091 --> 29:28.093
Holy shit.

29:30.095 --> 29:36.101
There's enough here for gas and
food, maybe even a shower.

29:38.103 --> 29:43.075
I understand how scary that must
have looked.

29:43.108 --> 29:45.077
But I got this. Hmm?

29:48.080 --> 29:54.086
Please? It won't happen again.

30:00.092 --> 30:01.093
Thank you.

30:07.099 --> 30:09.101
I'm going to go pay for this.

30:12.104 --> 30:14.106
I'll be right back.

30:23.115 --> 30:24.116
No.

30:26.118 --> 30:28.053
Come on, Judy. I think we
should give him another chance.

30:28.086 --> 30:32.057
No. He is literally a man-eating
monster.

30:32.090 --> 30:37.062
A monster who killed an asshole promoter that
fucked us and a ton of other bands, too.

30:37.095 --> 30:38.063
Yeah.

30:38.096 --> 30:39.097
No.

30:39.899 --> 30:43.068
Look, Judy.
He said it wouldn't happen again.

30:43.101 --> 30:44.470
He called us his friends.

30:44.503 --> 30:45.504
No.

30:47.105 --> 30:50.075
All right. Let's take a vote.

30:50.108 --> 30:55.113
All in favor to let Peck stay on with
us for the time being, raise 'em.

31:38.123 --> 31:41.126
Sun's up, darling, not a monster
in sight.

31:49.134 --> 31:51.103
What are we gonna do?

31:53.105 --> 31:57.075
Uh, continue to let him drive us
around.

31:57.109 --> 32:07.085
And pay for two star hotel rooms
and gas and snacks and...

32:07.119 --> 32:09.121
I'm not kidding.

32:17.129 --> 32:19.131
What was it like last night?

32:20.132 --> 32:21.099
With Peck?

32:21.133 --> 32:22.134
Yeah.

32:25.137 --> 32:27.105
Fucking horrific.

32:27.139 --> 32:30.108
I mean, you saw the aftermath.

32:30.142 --> 32:32.879
No no no, I mean like what did
he look like?

32:32.912 --> 32:36.883
Like, did he get like all ripped
like Incredible Hulk

32:36.916 --> 32:41.888
or did he like turn into a sexy
panther like in Cat People?

32:41.921 --> 32:44.122
No. No, nothing like that.

32:44.924 --> 32:51.129
He was just like a paler, uglier
version of himself if you can imagine.

32:52.932 --> 32:55.133
It's tough.

32:55.935 --> 33:00.907
Aren't you the slightest bit worried
that he could turn on one of us?

33:00.940 --> 33:04.142
Mmm. No.

33:04.944 --> 33:07.145
I mean he seems to have a system
in place.

33:10.950 --> 33:16.121
Or maybe, I just don't fear
death anymore.

33:17.924 --> 33:21.126
Oh. Cool.

33:27.934 --> 33:31.136
Hey Peck,
can I ask you a question?

33:34.941 --> 33:37.142
Sure buddy. What's up?

33:37.944 --> 33:39.912
What do people taste like?

33:39.946 --> 33:43.148
Oh, well. That's tough to say.

33:43.950 --> 33:47.152
You know, some people taste like
dog shit.

33:47.954 --> 33:51.924
And then other people taste
like watermelon sherbet.

33:51.958 --> 33:55.928
Hmm. Sounds like a metaphor for
humanity.

33:57.930 --> 33:59.932
That's deep, dude.

34:04.937 --> 34:07.940
What is the cheapest van on your
lot?

34:10.943 --> 34:12.945
Uh, what about to rent?

34:14.947 --> 34:18.951
Okay, what is the cheapest
vehicle you have that runs?

34:20.953 --> 34:22.955
Jesus. Okay.

34:24.956 --> 34:27.960
Do you know of any other numbers
that I should try?

34:28.960 --> 34:30.929
Yes. No, I already tried them.

34:30.963 --> 34:33.933
That is how I got your number.
So.

34:33.966 --> 34:39.938
Um, okay. Thank you. Goodbye.

34:49.949 --> 34:51.918
House of Independents, this is
Amir.

34:51.951 --> 34:54.920
Amir, hi. Uh, this is Judy, from
DUH.

34:54.954 --> 34:56.922
Uh, I know I'm calling
a little bit earlier than...

34:56.956 --> 34:59.959
Judy. I said Friday. Goodbye.

35:08.968 --> 35:09.969
Oh, hey Peck, wait.

35:10.970 --> 35:11.771
Oh, good morning, miss.

35:11.804 --> 35:13.940
Uh, I was just gonna get some
joe.

35:13.973 --> 35:15.975
Can I grab you a cup?

35:16.374 --> 35:19.912
No. But, can I borrow the keys
to the van?

35:19.946 --> 35:20.947
Oh sure.

35:22.949 --> 35:26.953
Ah, nice try Judy pie but I'm just
going to hold on to these bad boys, huh?

35:27.954 --> 35:28.955
I'll be right back.

35:42.969 --> 35:46.939
God, come on, Judy. We've done nothing
but listen to your music the whole time.

35:46.973 --> 35:50.943
Yeah, because my mixes rule,
your mixes honk.

35:50.977 --> 35:51.878
No they don't.

35:51.911 --> 35:54.947
Every one of my tapes is
carefully curated.

35:54.981 --> 35:56.949
Each one tells a story.

35:56.983 --> 35:59.919
Yours are so one note, Max.

35:59.952 --> 36:03.923
You have even been known to put
the same song twice on one side.

36:03.956 --> 36:04.957
Who does that?

36:05.557 --> 36:06.525
Me!

36:06.558 --> 36:06.993
No!

36:07.026 --> 36:07.927
Give it to me!

36:07.960 --> 36:08.761
Suck my clit.

36:08.795 --> 36:10.930
All right, all right, all right
now.

36:10.963 --> 36:11.964
Ya'll quit it.

36:13.565 --> 36:18.938
Now the rules of the road dictate that the
driver is in charge of picking the music.

36:18.971 --> 36:20.472
Now Judy, you had yesterday.

36:20.505 --> 36:24.944
Max, you've got today and then Mel,
you can have tomorrow if you want it.

36:24.977 --> 36:27.579
Nothing matters.

36:28.981 --> 36:31.984
Max, will you do the honors?

36:47.767 --> 36:51.971
For a band named Pissface
this is a real quaint HQ.

36:52.972 --> 36:54.941
How do you know these guys?

36:54.974 --> 36:56.976
Uh, guy.
And I don't.

36:57.777 --> 37:01.981
I came across their demo last year and I
just cold called the number on the back.

37:02.782 --> 37:04.984
You got gumption to the gills,
girl.

37:05.785 --> 37:09.588
How do we know that Pissface
isn't a bunch of creeps?

37:09.989 --> 37:13.960
Well, I talked to their bassist
Nick a couple times on the phone.

37:13.993 --> 37:17.964
Seems like a little bit of a goon,
but kind of like a harmless goon.

37:17.997 --> 37:19.431
Judy?

37:19.999 --> 37:21.968
Hey. I'm Nick.

37:22.001 --> 37:25.972
Oh, um. Hi.

37:26.973 --> 37:27.974
Really nice to meet you.

37:36.983 --> 37:40.953
So, I know it's a bit cramped,
but you guys can crash in my room.

37:40.987 --> 37:43.956
You can probably fit two in the bed
and then we have some sleeping bags

37:43.990 --> 37:45.958
for whoever wants to crash on
the floor.

37:45.992 --> 37:49.962
Are you sure that it's cool that
we're taking over your space?

37:49.996 --> 37:51.964
Yeah, yeah totally.

37:51.998 --> 37:54.967
So I'll let you guys relax and
decompress,

37:55.001 --> 37:57.970
um, but I was thinking maybe later we
could grab some beers, go swimming?

37:58.004 --> 38:01.974
Oh man. I bet you can do a sick
jackknife.

38:02.008 --> 38:04.010
Well, you'll have to wait and
see.

38:05.011 --> 38:05.945
I can't wait.

38:05.978 --> 38:07.947
Okay. Great.

38:07.980 --> 38:09.982
Um, make yourselves at home.

38:17.990 --> 38:19.959
I'm sorry, is it just me,

38:19.992 --> 38:24.964
or is he not one of the most beautiful
men we have ever laid eyes on?

38:24.997 --> 38:26.598
I know, right?

38:26.999 --> 38:28.000
He's okay.

38:28.801 --> 38:29.735
He's like a baby deer or
something.

38:29.769 --> 38:33.973
Yeah, like a baby deer with
perfect teeth.

38:34.006 --> 38:34.974
- Ohh!
- Damn!

38:35.007 --> 38:36.008
Mm-hmm.

38:37.009 --> 38:39.011
You better fuck that guy.

38:41.013 --> 38:42.014
Jesus, Mel. Shhh.

38:49.989 --> 38:52.959
Are you guys talking about
blowjob eyes?

38:52.992 --> 38:53.960
(Max)
Yup.

38:53.993 --> 38:56.963
What a fucking babe.

38:56.996 --> 39:01.000
You know, he reminds me of this camp
counselor I used to have back in the day.

39:03.002 --> 39:10.009
Same emerald green eyes, same
impeccable jawline, same inviting smile.

39:10.810 --> 39:12.979
He used to just sit next to me
at lunch.

39:13.012 --> 39:14.981
He would just sit down and he
would run his...

39:15.014 --> 39:16.015
(Mel)
Ew!

39:17.016 --> 39:19.018
Max, have some decency.

39:20.019 --> 39:20.987
What?

39:21.020 --> 39:21.988
Oh, ew.

39:22.021 --> 39:25.024
Whew. Lookin' good, Maxy boy.

39:30.997 --> 39:32.999
Do it again.
Hit me with it.

39:44.010 --> 39:44.977
Hey.

39:45.011 --> 39:45.978
Hi.

39:46.012 --> 39:47.246
Mind if I join you?

39:48.014 --> 39:49.015
Cheers.

39:50.016 --> 39:51.017
Cheers.

39:52.018 --> 39:54.020
Hey Nick, watch this.

40:02.028 --> 40:02.995
Good one, dude.

40:03.029 --> 40:04.030
Thanks!

40:05.031 --> 40:06.999
Max is an odd duck, huh?

40:07.033 --> 40:10.036
Oh yeah. Yeah.

40:14.006 --> 40:15.975
So I'm pretty stoked about the
show tomorrow.

40:16.008 --> 40:18.010
Mmm. Me too.

40:18.811 --> 40:21.981
Yeah. I've listened
to your band's demo nonstop.

40:22.014 --> 40:24.016
I was actually pretty nervous
to meet you guys today.

40:25.017 --> 40:26.986
Oh really?

40:27.019 --> 40:31.023
Yeah. I mean after talking to you on the
phone I didn't think you'd be so cute.

40:34.026 --> 40:36.996
- Not that I didn't think that you would be cute...
- Mm-hmm.

40:37.029 --> 40:41.033
Ah. Or attractiveness was the
only quality that I thought about.

40:41.834 --> 40:45.004
I don't really know what I'm
saying right now.

40:45.037 --> 40:46.038
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

40:47.039 --> 40:49.041
No, please. Ramble away.

40:51.043 --> 40:54.013
I just think that you are cool.

40:55.014 --> 40:56.015
And pretty.

40:57.016 --> 40:59.018
And your band kicks ass.

41:02.021 --> 41:04.990
Nah, no, no. No beer.

41:05.024 --> 41:06.025
More rambles.

41:09.028 --> 41:10.029
Um.

41:12.031 --> 41:14.033
You're cute, too.

41:15.434 --> 41:16.635
Yeah?

41:17.036 --> 41:18.037
Yeah.

41:28.047 --> 41:32.051
Hate to interrupt y'all,
but it's almost midnight.

41:33.052 --> 41:35.620
It's time for my insulin.

41:38.023 --> 41:48.033
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck...

41:54.039 --> 41:55.040
Hey.

41:58.043 --> 41:58.878
Everything okay?

41:58.911 --> 42:03.048
Yup. Just tucked Peck in for the
night.

42:03.849 --> 42:08.020
Ah. He knows he doesn't need
to sleep in the van, right?

42:08.053 --> 42:11.056
Mmm. No, he does.

42:12.057 --> 42:13.058
Okay.

42:17.029 --> 42:18.030
Well.

42:19.031 --> 42:20.032
Well.

42:21.033 --> 42:22.034
Do you need to borrow a shirt?

42:23.035 --> 42:27.039
Uh. Nah, nah. I'm good.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.042
Headed to bed?

42:30.843 --> 42:38.017
Yeah. Everyone else seems to have headed
to their respective sleeping quarters to...

42:38.050 --> 42:39.051
sleep.

42:42.054 --> 42:47.059
Um, well, if you wanted we could
just sit around here and talk.

42:49.061 --> 42:52.031
Yeah. That sounds nice.

42:52.064 --> 42:54.066
We could... talk.

42:58.771 --> 43:04.043
Aw fuck yeah, fuck yeah,
fuck yeah, fuck yeah, fuck yeah.

43:05.044 --> 43:10.049
Ah. Ah. Ah. Mmm. Ah. Oh.

43:11.050 --> 43:13.018
Yeah. Oh. Yeah.

43:13.052 --> 43:16.021
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh
shit I'm cumming.

43:16.055 --> 43:17.022
What? No!

43:17.056 --> 43:19.058
Oh, I came so hard.

43:20.059 --> 43:22.027
Uh, uh. Fuck, I came so hard.

43:22.061 --> 43:24.063
What? Goddamnit.

43:24.863 --> 43:30.069
Uh. Hey, where are you going?
Hmm?

43:51.056 --> 43:53.058
(MEL)
Is it too early to open a beer?

43:54.059 --> 43:57.062
(MEL)
Oh my god, Max.

44:00.065 --> 44:02.034
Nick, what's your favorite
potato chip flavor?

44:02.067 --> 44:05.037
Uh, sour cream and onion, bro.

44:05.070 --> 44:06.071
I like gummy worms.

44:08.073 --> 44:09.074
(All)
Morning.

44:10.075 --> 44:12.044
What's with all the commotion?

44:12.077 --> 44:14.079
Peck made scones for everybody.

44:14.480 --> 44:16.048
You bake.

44:16.081 --> 44:19.051
Aw, I dabble.

44:19.084 --> 44:21.020
Aw, don't be so modest Peck.

44:21.053 --> 44:25.057
These are the best scones
I've ever had in my entire life.

44:26.058 --> 44:28.060
Mmm. Mmm.

44:28.460 --> 44:29.461
Ah, fuck yeah, ah.

44:30.062 --> 44:33.065
Mmm. Mmm.

44:33.866 --> 44:37.069
Well, thank you kindly,
Nicholas.

44:37.870 --> 44:40.072
(MEL) No, seriously.
You should try one.

44:40.873 --> 44:43.042
They give your babies a run for
their money.

44:43.075 --> 44:44.076
Hot damn.

44:45.077 --> 44:46.045
Judy, you bake?

44:46.078 --> 44:47.046
Mm-hmm.

44:47.079 --> 44:50.049
We should swap recipes sometime.

44:50.082 --> 44:52.084
Mmm. Pass.

44:58.090 --> 44:59.491
You should really try one.

45:17.076 --> 45:20.079
Mmm. Goddammit.

45:38.097 --> 45:39.498
You smoke?

45:40.099 --> 45:41.500
I do.

45:43.102 --> 45:46.071
Ooh. Thank god.

45:50.075 --> 45:52.077
Can I uh, bum one of those?

46:04.089 --> 46:07.092
Shiloh. Dominion Rising.

46:09.094 --> 46:12.097
We're uh, headlining this little
thing.

46:13.098 --> 46:15.067
Judy. DUH.

46:15.100 --> 46:16.101
Oh, the opener.

46:17.102 --> 46:18.003
Nice.

46:18.036 --> 46:21.106
Actually, we're going second to
last. So.

46:22.107 --> 46:23.108
And what do you play?

46:24.109 --> 46:26.044
Co-vocalist and bass...

46:26.078 --> 46:26.880
That's cute.

46:26.912 --> 46:31.083
I'm the sole vocalist. Lyricist,
too.

46:31.885 --> 46:35.053
In addition I also write
most of the music for the band.

46:35.087 --> 46:36.321
Cool. That must be, um...

46:36.355 --> 46:42.060
I guess you could call our music
a meditation on love and loss.

46:42.094 --> 46:47.099
But, ultimately I think it's
just about the human experience.

46:49.101 --> 46:54.072
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's not all raw emotion.

46:54.106 --> 46:56.108
We can get super political too.

46:57.109 --> 47:00.112
Our last track was about Laos.

47:01.113 --> 47:03.115
What about it?

47:05.117 --> 47:06.118
You're kidding right?

47:06.920 --> 47:09.455
So, are you guys on tour or
what?

47:09.488 --> 47:10.489
Yeah.

47:13.091 --> 47:15.060
Actually, uh, this is our
first...

47:15.093 --> 47:16.061
Us too.

47:16.094 --> 47:19.097
Yup. Four days. For now.

47:21.099 --> 47:25.103
I gotta tell you though,
the gig life, not easy.

47:25.905 --> 47:28.073
When you guys get there you'll
see.

47:28.106 --> 47:31.109
It's not the romantic adventure
you thought it would be.

47:32.110 --> 47:34.112
That's good actually.

47:34.914 --> 47:37.115
<i>♪ When you get there and you see ♪</i>

47:37.917 --> 47:42.120
<i>♪ that's it's not the romantic
adventure</i> you thought it would be ♪

47:45.123 --> 47:45.892
Shit.

47:45.925 --> 47:48.126
I gotta get this poetry on
paper.

47:49.127 --> 47:51.096
Thanks for the smoke.

47:52.097 --> 47:53.098
Hey.

47:55.100 --> 47:56.101
Can I get that back?

47:59.104 --> 48:00.105
Oh.

48:07.112 --> 48:09.081
Wait, look at that. What is
that?

48:09.114 --> 48:10.115
Ohh.

48:23.128 --> 48:25.130
Hey. How ya doing?

48:30.135 --> 48:34.106
Seven songs, five bucks.
Can't beat that deal, huh?

48:39.111 --> 48:46.084
Fun fact, uh, we commissioned local artist
Marshmallow Dicks to create the front sleeve.

48:46.118 --> 48:48.120
Gorgeous, right?

48:50.122 --> 48:52.124
Be sure to stop back again.

48:58.130 --> 49:01.133
I would ease up on that sales
pitch.

49:02.134 --> 49:02.969
What do you mean?

49:03.002 --> 49:07.139
Desperation don't sell demos,
dude.

49:13.913 --> 49:15.882
Did you take a box of demos?

49:15.915 --> 49:19.117
Have you been giving any away?

49:19.919 --> 49:20.887
No.

49:20.920 --> 49:22.120
Ah, shit.

49:22.922 --> 49:24.891
We are definitely missing a box.

49:24.924 --> 49:25.892
Hey!

49:25.925 --> 49:29.127
I found my new calling, y'all.

49:29.929 --> 49:34.132
35 demos. Sold.

49:38.938 --> 49:40.907
Hi, are you selling the DUH
demo?

49:40.940 --> 49:41.808
Ah, you bet.

49:41.841 --> 49:44.911
I'll take one. Actually make
that two.

49:44.944 --> 49:47.145
All right, ten bucks.

49:48.948 --> 49:50.148
Thank you.

49:56.923 --> 49:59.124
Awesome. You guys rule.

49:59.926 --> 50:02.127
Thank you, ma'am.

50:04.931 --> 50:08.901
Ah, so glad we met, dude. So
glad.

50:08.935 --> 50:12.905
Hey, pleasure was all mine.
Really.

50:12.939 --> 50:13.906
Stay in touch?

50:13.940 --> 50:16.141
Oh, no doubt, amigo.

50:19.946 --> 50:23.116
You smell so good. Always.

50:23.950 --> 50:26.151
Okay, okay, okay.

50:39.932 --> 50:40.900
What's this?

50:40.933 --> 50:41.934
An invoice.

50:42.935 --> 50:43.936
For what?

50:44.336 --> 50:46.538
The morning after pill.

51:08.961 --> 51:10.930
(MEL)
Max, get that man a beer.

51:10.963 --> 51:12.932
(MEL) No, make that two beers.
I want a beer.

51:14.967 --> 51:16.969
(PECK)
Woo-hoo! You are crazy.

51:17.737 --> 51:19.471
(Mel) I didn't think
that they were that bad.

51:19.504 --> 51:23.910
Except, did you notice that the lead singer
had an emotional support animal on stage?

51:23.943 --> 51:24.911
Like, what's with...

51:24.944 --> 51:26.913
I'm going to bed. Let's do this.

51:26.946 --> 51:28.948
C'mon Judy. It's barely 11:00.

51:29.949 --> 51:30.917
Too bad.

51:30.950 --> 51:32.384
Come on, dude.

51:32.417 --> 51:35.922
We just opened some beers and you're
already making him sleep outside.

51:35.955 --> 51:37.924
Tough. I don't want to stay up
any longer.

51:37.957 --> 51:40.927
So don't. We'll make sure
he goes under before midnight.

51:40.960 --> 51:42.929
No. Please, Judy?

51:42.962 --> 51:44.964
Tonight's been so much fun.

51:45.965 --> 51:47.934
Please? Just a few more minutes?

51:47.967 --> 51:49.936
Yeah, no, no. We'll take care of
him.

51:49.969 --> 51:50.970
Go to bed.

51:57.977 --> 51:58.978
Goodnight.

51:59.946 --> 52:01.948
Night, Casanova.

52:05.952 --> 52:11.958
Anyways, his dog
is like his therapist, sort of?

52:12.759 --> 52:14.961
(MAX) No, come on, give me.
Let me try! Oh...

52:16.963 --> 52:19.966
(MEL) Oh shit,
I still have some on me. Fuck.

52:22.969 --> 52:24.937
(MAX)
Okay, okay. I know how to do it.

52:24.971 --> 52:25.972
(MAX)
What do I press?

52:28.975 --> 52:32.945
Yo! Put your head down so he
can get the top of your dome.

52:32.979 --> 52:33.980
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am.

52:37.984 --> 52:39.986
Oh, hey, hey, good mornin'!

52:42.955 --> 52:43.923
What's going on?

52:43.956 --> 52:47.927
Oh man. It was so gnarly.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.528
You're not gonna believe what
happened.

52:49.561 --> 52:50.930
Try me.

52:50.963 --> 52:52.965
Fucking metalheads, dude.

52:53.365 --> 52:54.533
Metalheads?

52:54.566 --> 52:55.968
Uh-huh, in the parking lot.

52:56.368 --> 52:57.937
In the parking lot?

52:57.970 --> 52:58.971
Yup.

52:59.371 --> 53:00.940
Metalheads in the parking lot?

53:00.973 --> 53:04.977
I can't believe you slept
through the whole thing!

53:06.979 --> 53:09.982
What happened with the
metalheads in the parking lot?

53:19.992 --> 53:24.964
Well, anyone wanna do the
honors?

53:25.965 --> 53:27.934
No, not me. I hate needles.

53:27.967 --> 53:29.969
I'll go get you a blanket.

53:50.990 --> 53:52.992
What the fuck?

53:54.994 --> 53:56.996
Metalheads.

54:16.983 --> 54:18.985
Hey Sid Vicious, that's a nice
blankie.

54:19.785 --> 54:21.954
Yeah, where's your fucking
mohawk?

54:21.988 --> 54:23.990
Your boyfriend cut it off?

54:26.993 --> 54:27.994
Have a beer on us, punk.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.968
Have at it, Peck.

54:36.002 --> 54:39.005
Hey. Hey. Are you all right?

54:49.982 --> 54:51.984
Excuse me, fellas?

54:53.986 --> 54:58.991
Fellas! Fellas, hello?

55:01.994 --> 55:03.996
You think you could take this
somewhere else?

55:06.999 --> 55:09.969
Me and my friends are trying to
sleep here.

55:10.002 --> 55:13.005
You're not being very
respectful.

55:16.008 --> 55:17.009
Please.

55:33.993 --> 55:34.994
Hey, fuckwad!

55:57.383 --> 55:57.984
Holy shit.

55:58.017 --> 55:59.018
Holy shit.

56:08.027 --> 56:09.962
All right, asshole.

56:09.996 --> 56:12.999
You're cruisin' for a fuckin'
bruisin'.

56:16.601 --> 56:17.970
Oh, shit! Fuck!

56:18.004 --> 56:19.005
Ew!

56:20.006 --> 56:21.007
(METALHEAD)
Gruesome!

56:24.010 --> 56:27.013
Ah! Ah! Oh fuck!

56:28.014 --> 56:30.016
Oh, God!

56:32.852 --> 56:35.988
(METALHEAD)
Oh no! Oh that's crazy!

56:39.025 --> 56:42.028
No, man. That's brutal, man.

56:44.030 --> 56:45.031
That's... that's brutal man.

56:47.033 --> 56:49.035
Come on, come on. No, man.

56:50.036 --> 56:52.570
Help! Help!

56:52.604 --> 56:54.572
Hell nah, man! Hell n-ah!

57:16.629 --> 57:17.997
Damn!

57:18.030 --> 57:19.031
Cool.

57:22.034 --> 57:23.035
So?

57:24.036 --> 57:25.603
So what?

57:25.638 --> 57:27.039
Pretty cool, huh?

57:28.040 --> 57:29.008
Cool?

57:29.041 --> 57:32.011
You think Peck killing two more
people is cool?

57:32.044 --> 57:33.979
Jeez, ungrateful much?

57:34.013 --> 57:34.980
I'll say.

57:35.014 --> 57:35.981
Peck broke his promise.

57:36.015 --> 57:37.983
You broke your promise.

57:38.017 --> 57:39.985
Uh, to defend Max.

57:40.019 --> 57:42.988
Yeah, and your uninterrupted
Judy sleep.

57:43.022 --> 57:43.989
Unbelievable!

57:44.023 --> 57:45.991
Now, don't be too hard on Judy.

57:46.025 --> 57:47.993
I don't need any veneration.

57:48.027 --> 57:53.032
I was just doin' what any friend
would do in a situation like that.

57:55.034 --> 57:56.001
Fuck!

57:56.035 --> 57:58.003
Fu... what day is today?

57:58.037 --> 57:59.638
Wednesday?

58:00.039 --> 58:01.006
Friday?

58:01.040 --> 58:02.007
Yeah, it's Friday.

58:02.041 --> 58:05.010
Friday. Yeah. It's Friday.

58:05.044 --> 58:07.046
I need to get to a phone!

58:13.052 --> 58:14.987
House of Independents, this is
Amir.

58:15.020 --> 58:17.990
Hi! Uh, this is Judy from DUH.

58:18.023 --> 58:20.993
Judy! I'm disappointed.

58:21.026 --> 58:25.030
I've been in the office
a full 11 minutes, almost 12.

58:25.831 --> 58:28.033
You know, I didn't think
I was gonna hear from ya.

58:28.834 --> 58:33.005
Well, I, uh... I wanted to make
sure you had time to get your coffee

58:33.038 --> 58:36.008
and your cruller before I
called.

58:36.041 --> 58:38.043
(Amir)
I see.

58:39.044 --> 58:41.046
So, I listened to the demo.

58:43.048 --> 58:45.017
Does it look like she's getting
good news?

58:45.050 --> 58:46.652
I can't tell.

58:47.052 --> 58:51.056
Looks like she sat on a
hornet's nest if you ask me.

59:06.038 --> 59:09.041
Yes! Yeah! Yeah!

59:10.042 --> 59:14.046
Yes! Yes! Woo-hoo!

59:26.058 --> 59:29.061
Christ. This bozo.

59:35.067 --> 59:36.068
Hi, Janey.

59:37.069 --> 59:38.037
Judy.

59:38.070 --> 59:40.005
Of course! How are you?

59:40.039 --> 59:42.041
Long time no see, right?

59:42.841 --> 59:47.012
Listen, I just talked to the promoter,
if you can even call him that.

59:47.046 --> 59:50.049
And he mentioned that you guys
are headlining tonight.

59:51.050 --> 59:52.051
Is that right?

59:53.052 --> 59:55.054
I guess. If that's what he said.

59:56.055 --> 59:58.023
Huh. Weird.

59:58.057 --> 01:00:02.027
You know, from one artist to
another, I have to say,

01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:04.029
I think this lineup was made in
haste.

01:00:04.063 --> 01:00:08.067
With a reckless inattention to
the fans who came out to see us.

01:00:08.867 --> 01:00:14.039
You know, Bernardsville is kind
of a home away from home for us.

01:00:14.073 --> 01:00:20.045
And from what I understand,
your band is greener than sugar snaps.

01:00:22.047 --> 01:00:23.048
I see.

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:26.018
You do?

01:00:26.051 --> 01:00:28.053
I'm delighted to hear.

01:00:28.854 --> 01:00:31.023
We'll just go and explain that
there was a misunderstanding

01:00:31.056 --> 01:00:33.058
and get the set times switched.

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:39.064
Oh no. There's been no
misunderstanding.

01:00:42.067 --> 01:00:43.068
What was that?

01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:47.039
We are closing out the show.

01:00:47.072 --> 01:00:51.076
Your band is opening for our
band.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.083
Poor, poor little Jack.

01:01:00.085 --> 01:01:05.057
Beanstalk or not,
you don't wanna mess with this giant.

01:01:06.058 --> 01:01:09.061
Oh yeah? Or what?

01:01:16.068 --> 01:01:19.071
Hands off the vehicle, hombre.

01:01:24.076 --> 01:01:26.078
You're lucky I'm a pacifist.

01:01:29.081 --> 01:01:31.083
Boys!

01:01:36.088 --> 01:01:38.090
- What a cunt.
- What a cunt.

01:02:05.084 --> 01:02:07.086
Fuck!

01:02:16.095 --> 01:02:18.063
Uh, hi.

01:02:18.097 --> 01:02:21.066
Um, uh, I'm Max.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.068
Uh, yeah. That's right.

01:02:23.102 --> 01:02:29.041
Max is my name and, uh, guitar
is my game.

01:02:29.942 --> 01:02:35.080
- Uh, our band is called band
DUH...

01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:42.054
And uhh... and uhh... and
uhh... and uhh

01:02:42.087 --> 01:02:45.057

Thank you, ma'am.

01:06:01.921 --> 01:06:04.122
Nice dance moves earlier.

01:06:05.925 --> 01:06:10.128
Yeah. I probably should
have stretched beforehand.

01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:11.898
Oof!

01:06:11.931 --> 01:06:14.132
Well, drink up, grandpa.

01:06:17.937 --> 01:06:26.913
Look, um, I know you and I haven't
exactly seen eye to eye so far this tour.

01:06:26.946 --> 01:06:32.919
And, um, I still haven't exactly come to terms
with the fact that you are a monster...

01:06:32.952 --> 01:06:36.121
Well I prefer the term, "thing."

01:06:36.923 --> 01:06:40.125
Thing, that eats people.

01:06:40.927 --> 01:06:44.897
But, I also know that you're not
a bad guy.

01:06:44.931 --> 01:06:47.900
And I'm happy you're here.

01:06:47.934 --> 01:06:50.135
Sometimes.

01:06:50.937 --> 01:06:55.140
Well comin' from you,
that is a glowing endorsement.

01:07:02.949 --> 01:07:09.154
For as long as I can remember,
this is all I have ever wanted to do.

01:07:09.956 --> 01:07:14.927
And tonight felt like the first
time that I was actually doing it.

01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:17.930
So, thank you.

01:07:22.935 --> 01:07:23.936
My pleasure.

01:07:30.943 --> 01:07:33.913
Oh, well, almost showtime, huh?

01:07:33.946 --> 01:07:36.949
I should probably get to it.

01:07:38.951 --> 01:07:42.955
Do you wanna come inside,
make sure everything's on the up and up?

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:48.961
Nah. I trust you.

01:07:49.962 --> 01:07:50.963
Night, Peck.

01:07:53.966 --> 01:07:54.967
Night.

01:08:11.951 --> 01:08:14.954
Peck! We gotta move, let's go!

01:08:15.755 --> 01:08:17.924
What could be taking him so
long?

01:08:17.957 --> 01:08:20.960
Pecker! Let's go!

01:08:27.966 --> 01:08:29.935
Why are you wearing our shirt?

01:08:29.969 --> 01:08:32.939
Okay, A, it's the only thing
clean I have.

01:08:32.971 --> 01:08:35.975
And, two, our band is good.

01:08:36.975 --> 01:08:39.946
God, I am so hungover.

01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:41.913
Oh, Max, give me your hand.

01:08:41.948 --> 01:08:42.915
Why?

01:08:42.948 --> 01:08:44.951
Max, hand.

01:08:48.955 --> 01:08:49.921
What is this?

01:08:49.956 --> 01:08:53.960
Memorize it word for word.

01:08:54.961 --> 01:08:56.828
Is this really necessary?

01:08:56.863 --> 01:08:57.529
Yes.

01:08:57.562 --> 01:08:58.563
Absolutely.

01:08:58.965 --> 01:09:02.969
Oh, there he is. Finally.

01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:05.938
Sorry to keep y'all waitin'.

01:09:05.971 --> 01:09:10.943
So, where we headed, huh?

01:09:10.977 --> 01:09:12.979

Whoops!

01:11:33.986 --> 01:11:36.956
Thanks. We're DUH.

01:11:36.989 --> 01:11:39.992
If anyone has a place for us to crash
tonight, that'd be most excellent.

01:11:40.793 --> 01:11:42.962
We got some demos and t-shirts
for sale.

01:11:42.995 --> 01:11:45.998
This is our last song and it
goes out to our buddy Peck.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.001

So how was my stage banter?
Did I bring it?

01:13:16.022 --> 01:13:18.024
It was adequate with a capital
A.

01:13:18.824 --> 01:13:22.028
I second that. Very proud,
Maxwell.

01:13:23.029 --> 01:13:24.030
Thanks.

01:13:25.031 --> 01:13:26.999
Hey, you guys were so good.

01:13:27.033 --> 01:13:30.036
Do you have any music for sale?

01:13:31.037 --> 01:13:33.005
Max, demo the girl.

01:13:35.007 --> 01:13:38.978
Thanks. Are you guys still looking
for a place to crash tonight?

01:13:39.011 --> 01:13:41.013
We are indeed.

01:13:41.814 --> 01:13:44.984
Well if you'd like, you can come with me
to my grandma's. We've got tons of room.

01:13:45.017 --> 01:13:47.987
Really? You're sure she wouldn't
mind?

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.989
Yeah, she's totally cool with
it.

01:13:50.022 --> 01:13:51.991
We already have another band
staying the night.

01:13:52.024 --> 01:13:54.026
Ah, rad! Who's the other band?

01:14:02.034 --> 01:14:03.035
Turf war.

01:14:04.036 --> 01:14:06.038
A roof's a roof, y'all.

01:14:06.839 --> 01:14:10.042
Ugh. He even walks like a
dickhead.

01:14:10.843 --> 01:14:14.013
I guess we can officially call
each other tour mates now.

01:14:15.014 --> 01:14:16.614
Here's the situation.

01:14:16.649 --> 01:14:21.020
I talked to the girl, and there are two
rooms in this house. One for each band.

01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:24.990
Now, I figured given the fact that
y'all are last minute additions,

01:14:25.024 --> 01:14:27.026
we'll take the larger room.

01:14:27.827 --> 01:14:34.033
I mean, that and the fact that we're
four men and just need more space.

01:14:35.634 --> 01:14:40.039
You think I'm being sexist or somethin'?
I mean, this is just biology here.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:44.043
More body mass and all that.
You guys understand, right?

01:14:59.024 --> 01:15:01.026
Glad we cleared that up.

01:15:07.032 --> 01:15:10.002
Maybe we just leave and drive
through the night.

01:15:10.035 --> 01:15:16.008
Ah, nonsense. You guys need a good
night's sleep before the big show.

01:15:16.041 --> 01:15:18.043
We can make this work.

01:15:18.844 --> 01:15:22.047
Yeah, I mean, it is getting
late.

01:15:24.049 --> 01:15:25.451
Okay.

01:15:25.484 --> 01:15:29.021
Peck, you sleep in here. The three of
us, we'll stay in the living room.

01:15:29.054 --> 01:15:29.855
Are you sure?

01:15:30.823 --> 01:15:36.061
Yeah. You snore like a son of a bitch so
don't think this is like a selfless gesture.

01:15:37.062 --> 01:15:38.130
I'll take it.

01:15:38.164 --> 01:15:41.033
We just need to get
the sleeping bags from the van.

01:15:43.035 --> 01:15:45.037
Well, here.

01:15:47.039 --> 01:15:52.044
You get what you need from the van
and, uh, I'll hit the hay.

01:16:12.064 --> 01:16:15.067
I guess I'l go get all of our
shit.

01:16:25.044 --> 01:16:28.013
<i>Chase Nutley</i> and here are
tonight's top stories.

01:16:28.047 --> 01:16:32.017
<i>Murderous mayhem at the Moon Motel.</i>
How did a cozy cabin off the highway

01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:35.020
<i>become a sick carnival of
carnage</i> early Saturday morning?

01:16:35.054 --> 01:16:36.222
Bedtime.

01:16:36.255 --> 01:16:39.024
<i>On the scene is our own Chip
Hardaway</i> with the latest.

01:16:39.058 --> 01:16:41.026
Where should we set all of this
up?

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.928
<i>Thanks, Steve.</i>

01:16:42.962 --> 01:16:47.199
<i>Well it was a grizzly scene as the police</i> were
called over here to the Moon Motel on RT 9

01:16:47.233 --> 01:16:52.037
<i>where officers discovered the dead and</i>
half-eaten bodies of two motel employees.

01:16:52.071 --> 01:16:54.073
<i>The officers were offering no
information</i> on leads at this time

01:16:54.473 --> 01:16:58.043
<i>but they have confirmed</i> the
identities of the two victims.

01:16:58.077 --> 01:17:01.046
<i>They are Mark Spivey, age 27...</i>

01:17:10.055 --> 01:17:11.056
Where's Max?

01:17:16.061 --> 01:17:17.062
Hey, have you guys seen...

01:17:24.069 --> 01:17:25.070
Hello there.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:40.085
Damn. It looks like you guys won't
be making the show tomorrow night.

01:17:41.086 --> 01:17:44.023
But, fear not, we'll just make...

01:17:53.065 --> 01:17:54.600
Hello.

01:17:54.634 --> 01:17:58.037
Hey, it's past midnight and my grandma
has work really early in the morning.

01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:01.040
You guys really need to keep it
down or she's gonna be pissed.

01:18:01.073 --> 01:18:05.077
Of course. Of course. Namaste.

01:18:11.083 --> 01:18:12.084
Where was I?

01:18:13.085 --> 01:18:15.054
Oh, the show.

01:18:15.087 --> 01:18:18.057
Fear not, we'll just make sure
to stop by the venue

01:18:18.090 --> 01:18:22.094
in case The Queef Queens
need a last minute replacement.

01:18:28.067 --> 01:18:34.039
Now all we have to do is round up your
white trash roadie and we'll be on our way.

01:19:07.072 --> 01:19:13.078
Hoo, so, uh,
that was pretty wild back there, huh?

01:19:24.089 --> 01:19:26.091
Oh! What the fuck?!

01:19:28.193 --> 01:19:31.096
Does anybody have any music
they wanna listen to?

01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:35.100
Hey, Max, you wanna choose a
station?

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.104
All right, listen, I am really sorry
that you're all covered in my dookie

01:20:12.906 --> 01:20:16.074
but I came to your rescue,
didn't I?

01:20:24.116 --> 01:20:27.119
How were you able to do that
when you sedated yourself?

01:20:29.121 --> 01:20:33.091
Just some kind of sixth sense
shit, I guess?

01:20:33.893 --> 01:20:37.095
Like when a mother knows that
her kids is hurt.

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.101
Wait!

01:20:58.116 --> 01:21:00.085
Esteban Mendoza?

01:21:00.118 --> 01:21:03.088
Okay, wait. Ju... just let...

01:21:03.121 --> 01:21:04.122
What the fuck?

01:21:05.123 --> 01:21:09.127
Peck, is this your van?

01:21:11.129 --> 01:21:13.098
I can't believe I was so stupid.

01:21:14.099 --> 01:21:17.102
Now hold your horses.

01:21:18.103 --> 01:21:20.105
So this isn't your van.

01:21:20.907 --> 01:21:23.108
What have you been injecting
yourself with?

01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:26.278
Water.

01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:29.081
So you've been hydrating
yourself every night?

01:21:29.114 --> 01:21:30.115
I'm gonna be sick.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.121
Hey, hey now.

01:21:38.123 --> 01:21:41.126
How many people have you killed
since we started this tour?

01:21:42.127 --> 01:21:43.128
Don't lie to us!

01:21:48.133 --> 01:21:50.502
Well, counting the four back
there?

01:21:50.536 --> 01:21:52.104
Just let them go.

01:21:52.137 --> 01:21:56.074
No, no can do.
I mean, not at the moment at least.

01:21:56.108 --> 01:22:00.112
We'll play our show tonight and
then we'll decide our next move.

01:22:00.914 --> 01:22:03.382
No. No, we are not playing
tonight.

01:22:03.415 --> 01:22:04.082
What?!

01:22:04.116 --> 01:22:05.083
Come on.

01:22:05.117 --> 01:22:07.085
No, I second that.

01:22:07.119 --> 01:22:13.125
I mean you told me yourself,
this is your dream finally realized.

01:22:13.927 --> 01:22:20.132
Now if you don't follow through
with it you're gonna regret it.

01:22:55.935 --> 01:22:58.905
Hey, you guys are 45
minutes late to soundcheck.

01:22:58.938 --> 01:23:00.907
I know. I'm sorry.

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.910
You smell like shit. Is that
shit?

01:23:03.943 --> 01:23:07.914
No. Um, the van broke down in
mud, maybe it's manure. I don't.

01:23:07.947 --> 01:23:09.916
I don't know.

01:23:09.949 --> 01:23:11.751
How punk.

01:23:11.784 --> 01:23:14.921
Listen, if you wanna bring your van around,
we have some guys who can help you load in...

01:23:14.954 --> 01:23:19.124
No. Um, we, uh, got it
ourselves, actually.

01:23:19.926 --> 01:23:23.128
Okay, then just get on stage.
We have a sound guy waiting for you.

01:24:20.953 --> 01:24:24.924
Hey. You're in DUH, right?

01:24:24.957 --> 01:24:28.928
Uh, yeah. Hi, Judy.

01:24:28.961 --> 01:24:30.963
Right on. Jenn Jennings.

01:24:31.764 --> 01:24:35.968
Yes. Of course you are. I, I
know.

01:24:36.769 --> 01:24:40.940
I, uh, just listened to your demo
the other day. Your band is great.

01:24:41.741 --> 01:24:44.911
That's, uh, cool. That means a
lot.

01:24:44.944 --> 01:24:47.914
Uh, I, we thank you.

01:24:47.947 --> 01:24:51.918
Um, we all really love
you guys, girls, women.

01:24:51.951 --> 01:24:54.921
Your band, we, uh, love also.

01:24:54.954 --> 01:24:55.955
Nervous?

01:24:56.956 --> 01:24:59.959
Uh, very. Very nervous.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:01.861
Do I look it?

01:25:01.894 --> 01:25:04.931
Uh, a bit but you know, nerves
are good.

01:25:04.964 --> 01:25:07.967
So what's the plan for the next
release?

01:25:08.768 --> 01:25:17.944
Uh, well, we just got back from tour and
things are kinda up in the air at the moment.

01:25:17.977 --> 01:25:22.949
So, I don't know actually.

01:25:25.952 --> 01:25:26.953
Totally.

01:25:27.787 --> 01:25:31.924
Hey, if you're into it,
we should get together next week and talk.

01:25:31.958 --> 01:25:37.930
My partner and I, we own a label and I
think your stuff if right up our alley.

01:25:37.964 --> 01:25:38.931
Wow, really?

01:25:38.965 --> 01:25:39.799
Yeah.

01:25:39.832 --> 01:25:42.969
I, uh, we would really
appreciate that.

01:25:44.971 --> 01:25:48.941
I'll, uh, be right back.

01:25:48.975 --> 01:25:53.980
Could you just, uh, please,
just excuse me? Okay.

01:25:59.986 --> 01:26:01.988
What the fuck are you doing
here?

01:26:03.956 --> 01:26:08.961
Oh, I just wanted to soak it in,
be a part of the moment, you know?

01:26:09.762 --> 01:26:11.964
Where's the girl and her
grandmother?

01:26:12.765 --> 01:26:16.969
Don't worry. I threw a
couple of blankets over them.

01:26:17.770 --> 01:26:21.974
I'm just gonna be here a few
minutes. No harm.

01:26:22.775 --> 01:26:26.979
It's over, Peck. You're out of
the band.

01:26:28.981 --> 01:26:29.982
Excuse me?

01:26:31.984 --> 01:26:35.988
I don't think you have the
authority to make that decision.

01:26:36.789 --> 01:26:42.995
Okay, band vote. Who wants Peck
out of the band? Raise 'em.

01:26:51.971 --> 01:26:55.975
After our set you're gonna let them
go and drive off, and if you don't,

01:26:56.776 --> 01:26:58.978
I'm gonna call the cops
and tell them everything.

01:27:07.987 --> 01:27:15.995
Well, Judy, you might wanna
rethink your ultimatum.

01:27:16.796 --> 01:27:26.005
And y'all might wanna rethink your vote,
seeing that it's so close to midnight and all.

01:27:31.978 --> 01:27:33.980
Yo, DUH, you're up!

01:27:42.989 --> 01:27:44.991
Knock 'em dead, y'all.

01:27:59.005 --> 01:28:02.008
Miss, the white van in the parking
lot, is that yours?

01:28:13.986 --> 01:28:16.989
Miss? The white Dodge van, is
that yours?

01:29:48.814 --> 01:29:53.986
<i>There was an audible gasp in the courtroom</i>
when Judge Morris Roland declared a mistrial

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:59.025
<i>in the multiple homicide case involving</i>
three members of NJ rock band DUH.

01:29:59.825 --> 01:30:01.494
<i>After nearly two full days</i>
of deliberation,

01:30:01.526 --> 01:30:05.998
<i>twelve jurors returned to the court room</i>
split on whether to find the accused:

01:30:06.032 --> 01:30:08.000
<i>27 year-old Judith Campbell</i>

01:30:08.034 --> 01:30:10.002
<i>25 year-old Maxwell Jenkins</i>

01:30:10.036 --> 01:30:12.004
<i>and 24 year-old Melissa Moxie</i>

01:30:12.038 --> 01:30:15.975
<i>guilty of murdering four men</i>
on the night of August 15th.

01:30:16.008 --> 01:30:18.978
<i>Many attribute the surprise
outcome</i> to Katrina McNeill

01:30:19.011 --> 01:30:21.981
<i>and her grandmother, Ruth Dietrich,</i>
who testified in court last Friday

01:30:22.014 --> 01:30:24.984
<i>that an older,
yet-to-be-identified man,</i>

01:30:25.017 --> 01:30:28.988
<i>was responsible for the deaths of four
men</i> in Dietrich's cottage last August.

01:30:29.021 --> 01:30:32.992
<i>The band, who have long maintained</i>
that they were taken hostage

01:30:33.025 --> 01:30:35.995
<i>and unable to escape</i> both
during and after the murders,

01:30:36.028 --> 01:30:39.999
<i>left the courtroom earlier today,</i>
free for the first time in seven months.

01:30:40.032 --> 01:30:43.035
