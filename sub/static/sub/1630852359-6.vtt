00:11.979 --> 00:13.981
[German and Slavic chatter]

00:25.493 --> 00:30.030
Elsa: We moved towards Doan's
Crossing and the Red River.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.801
And tragedy's next opportunity
to ravage what's left of us...

00:37.871 --> 00:40.208
My mother says
the pain will fade.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.943
And the good memories
will return.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.878
I suppose that's true.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.447
[sobbing]

00:46.447 --> 00:49.717
Every person on this planet
will endure this pain

00:49.717 --> 00:51.885
until they are the cause
of it for another.

00:53.321 --> 00:56.457
Someday, I'll die
and shatter hearts, too.

00:58.326 --> 01:01.295
But that is not today.

01:01.295 --> 01:04.332
Today I am living
and I'm the shattered.

01:04.332 --> 01:07.668
[sobbing]

01:23.951 --> 01:27.121
Thomas: Oughta try and hire
a cowboy away from 'em.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.889
And a cook.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.559
- Can't mess with
an outfit's cook.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.562
You steal their cattle
and they wouldn't be madder.

01:34.562 --> 01:38.166
I ain't looking for
a gun fight this morning.

01:38.166 --> 01:41.702
We'll hire a cook and a cowboy
going the other way at Doan's.

01:43.971 --> 01:47.007
How's she doing?

01:47.007 --> 01:48.509
- About how you'd expect.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.614
[clicks tongue]

01:56.850 --> 02:02.290
[music]

02:47.601 --> 02:48.602
- You hungry?

02:48.602 --> 02:50.438
- No.

02:50.438 --> 02:51.605
- Where are you going?

02:51.605 --> 02:54.342
- I need some privacy.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.543
- Why do you need privacy?

02:58.279 --> 02:59.580
- I got my period.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.694
- Death is everywhere.

03:15.929 --> 03:19.066
It follows us like a stray dog,

03:19.066 --> 03:21.269
waiting to devour
us like scraps.

03:24.538 --> 03:29.610
The pain it causes
is so acute, so complete...

03:32.946 --> 03:37.285
It's hard to understand how
it benefits us, as a species.

03:38.652 --> 03:42.356
[music]

03:42.356 --> 03:44.057
What purpose does pain serve?

03:46.827 --> 03:50.163
I understand desire
and fear...

03:52.500 --> 03:53.934
And love...

03:55.469 --> 03:58.005
And how they protect us
and better our lives

03:58.005 --> 04:01.775
and bring new life.

04:01.775 --> 04:02.876
But grief...

04:04.445 --> 04:09.650
If I weren't so consumed by it,
it would baffle me.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.168
- I know how you feel.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.439
A lot of people
are gonna tell you that.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.310
Whether it's the truth
or not, I don't know.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.348
But I know it's true
when I say it.

04:42.149 --> 04:45.152
I have sat right
where you're sitting,

04:45.152 --> 04:46.520
thinking the same thing.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.557
Thinking I don't want
to live without them.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.460
Don't see the point.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.828
Still do most days.

04:58.265 --> 05:02.302
But here I am...
living without them.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.407
- Why?

05:07.708 --> 05:09.710
- Well...

05:09.710 --> 05:12.245
My reasons'd be
different than yours.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.283
I don't have anyone
left who loves me.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.620
You do.

05:22.723 --> 05:26.494
[music]

05:26.494 --> 05:27.828
I'll tell you a secret.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.435
[sniffs]

05:39.507 --> 05:41.942
I'll tell you why
I'm still sucking air today.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.780
I'm headed to the ocean.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.119
- The ocean?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.824
[sniffs]

05:56.824 --> 05:59.026
- An Apache scout
told me once...

06:02.129 --> 06:04.432
that when you love somebody,
you trade souls with them.

06:06.467 --> 06:10.438
They get a piece of yours,
and you get a piece of theirs.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.477
But when your love dies...

06:21.048 --> 06:23.083
A little piece
of you dies with them.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.255
That's why you hurt so bad.
- [crying]

06:29.990 --> 06:32.526
But that little piece
of him is still inside you.

06:35.295 --> 06:39.567
And he can use your eyes
to see the world.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.872
So...

06:44.872 --> 06:46.907
I'm taking my wife
to the ocean...

06:50.410 --> 06:52.746
And I'm gonna sit on
the beach, and let her see it.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.818
That was her dream.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.022
Then I'm going to see her.

07:04.825 --> 07:05.959
That's my dream.

07:13.066 --> 07:17.771
In the meantime, the herd
could sure use its cowgirl.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.698

08:22.469 --> 08:23.671

[speaking Slavic]

10:38.238 --> 10:41.508
[music]

10:48.882 --> 10:52.753
- If you need something from the
traders, I'll get it for you.

10:52.753 --> 10:56.156
You stay here
and keep them kids close.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.858
There's as many thieves
as traders out there.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.129
[music]

11:02.129 --> 11:07.400
- My husband's things.
I have to sell them.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.103
- Yes, ma'am, I'll get 'em sold.

11:11.438 --> 11:12.773
- Thank you.

11:12.773 --> 11:17.577
[music]

11:17.577 --> 11:20.513
- Don't sell that shotgun.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.583
- I don't know how to use it.
- I can teach you to use it.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.352
You're gonna need it.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.258
[horse trots away]

11:42.102 --> 11:44.104
- I wonder
if they got dairy cows.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.339
Cause I'd like some milk.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.541
- Milk will spoil.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.978
- The way this damn
wagon rattles,

11:50.978 --> 11:52.679
milk will be butter
in an afternoon.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.647
- [chuckles]

11:54.647 --> 11:57.484
Grab some more coffee
too, would you?

11:57.484 --> 12:00.453
- Take John. I'd like
to spend some time with Elsa.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.257
- All right, come on, son.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.127
Here we go.
[grunts]

12:11.799 --> 12:13.767
Don't let those traders
swindle you.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.635
- I plan on doing
the swindling.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.004
- [laughs]

12:17.004 --> 12:17.838
I'll bet.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.219
- Ride with me.

12:34.387 --> 12:37.024
- Gotta watch the herd.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.491
- The first decent
grass these cattle

12:38.491 --> 12:39.692
have seen in a week.

12:39.692 --> 12:40.994
The cattle will be fine.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.430
Wade!

12:44.764 --> 12:46.033
[clicks tongue]

12:46.033 --> 12:49.302
I'm gonna take her
to the trading post.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.171
Do you need anything?

12:51.171 --> 12:52.973
- Well...

12:52.973 --> 12:54.574
I wouldn't be mad
at a chocolate bar,

12:54.574 --> 12:55.876
if they happen to have one.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.144
- [chuckles]

12:57.144 --> 12:58.879
If they have one,
I'll buy it.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.347
- Much appreciated.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.783
- Come on.

13:52.699 --> 13:53.766
- What?

13:55.335 --> 13:56.970
What!

13:56.970 --> 13:58.205
- You's what.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.107
It's a free country.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.042
I can look at whatever I want.

14:02.042 --> 14:06.013
Judging by the way you're
dressed, you don't mind it.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.181
[laughs]

14:08.181 --> 14:10.783
- I mind it.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.886
- What are you going
to do about it?

14:12.886 --> 14:15.923
[music]

14:15.923 --> 14:17.624
- I like this one.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.825
- Let me see.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.762
You've got expensive
taste, boy.

14:22.762 --> 14:23.830
Margaret: James!

14:26.499 --> 14:28.301
- You gonna shoot me,
little girl?

14:30.737 --> 14:33.040
- Goddam right I am.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.410
- It's harder to do
than you think.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.979
- No, it ain't.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.547
- It comes real natural to me.

14:42.349 --> 14:46.619
- Look, we was just funnin'
and she pulls iron.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.521
- I guess she wasn't
having too much fun.

14:48.521 --> 14:52.359
- All right.
All right.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.395
Just...
I put it down, okay?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.863
I put it down.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.398
- James.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.133
- I don't wanna waste looking
over my shoulder for you.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.302
- You won't find us if you do.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.971
We's headed to Fort Worth.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.605
- Well, I'd be headed that way.

15:05.605 --> 15:09.309
[music]

15:15.782 --> 15:16.783
[uncocks gun]

15:24.591 --> 15:25.925
- What is wrong with you?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.361
- Give it to me.

15:31.064 --> 15:34.001
You don't point this at anyone
unless you plan on using it.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.170
- I was gonna use it.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.808
- [sighs]

15:41.808 --> 15:43.743
- Go to camp,
and you wait there!

15:46.646 --> 15:51.084
[music]

16:01.128 --> 16:03.796
[indistinct chatter]

16:30.490 --> 16:34.394
- Whoo! Pretty short fuse
on that girl.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.463
- It's not long.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.966
- Some of them cowgirls
is ranker than the cowboys.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.035
Like they ain't
never had a mother.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.571
- I'm her mother.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.374
- [sighs]

16:48.575 --> 16:50.210
- Would you like a lemonade?

16:51.178 --> 16:52.812
- I would not, thank you.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.085
- How bout a whiskey punch?

17:00.787 --> 17:02.255
[music]

17:02.255 --> 17:03.790
You look like you could use it.

17:08.895 --> 17:09.762
- Would you join me?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.398
- [laughs]

17:11.398 --> 17:15.435
Sister, I been joining you
since noon.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.469
- [chuckles]

17:24.911 --> 17:26.513
Ice.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.482
- My husband bought a block
in Fort Worth in January.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.219
Got the ice box down our well.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.786
Hundred pound block
will last till June

17:33.786 --> 17:36.289
if we don't get in there much.
- Mm.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.424
This is the last of it

17:37.424 --> 17:39.126
and I ain't letting one
bit go to waste.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.300
[chuckles]
[sniffs]

17:49.035 --> 17:51.238
[music]

17:57.110 --> 18:00.447
- Sorry.
Thank you.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.816
- Children can have that effect.

18:04.817 --> 18:05.985
Mine sure did.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.558
[music]

18:23.536 --> 18:24.504
- How was it?

18:33.580 --> 18:34.881
- Not worth going.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.084
- They never are.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.958
Stars for a blanket.

18:48.861 --> 18:49.996
Ground for a bed.

18:52.732 --> 18:56.636
Good horse, open country.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.806
That's all a cowboy needs.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.876
Guess it's all
a cowgirl needs too.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.948
[music]

19:18.358 --> 19:20.727
- Oregon?

19:20.727 --> 19:21.728
- Yep.

19:24.897 --> 19:28.134
- Mmmm.

19:28.134 --> 19:32.305
Once I get there how the hell
am I supposed to get back?

19:32.305 --> 19:36.008
- We'll put your wagon
and horses on a train

19:36.008 --> 19:38.044
and send you
wherever you want to go.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.216
- Why can't they cook
for themselves?

19:45.385 --> 19:47.220
- Can't do much
of nothing for themselves.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.691
- Which way you going?

19:51.691 --> 19:52.792
- We'll cut through South Pass,

19:54.294 --> 19:58.265
Drop into Salt Lake,
and head west from there.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.132
- You won't beat the winter.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.000
- We'll beat it.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.605
- What about beef?

20:05.605 --> 20:07.474
Hmm? You got beef?

20:07.474 --> 20:09.442
'Cause there ain't shit
for game once you hit Kansas.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.011
- Fifty head.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.182
What else you gonna do?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.085
- [laughing]

20:25.458 --> 20:27.860
You buy the supplies

20:27.860 --> 20:30.730
and I'm hundred fifty a month,
plus the freight home.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.532
- Deal.

20:32.532 --> 20:37.169
- It's my chuck wagon,
so it's my rules.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.771
They eat what I cook.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.073
If they don't like it they
can complain to somebody else

20:41.073 --> 20:42.609
'cause I don't wanna
fucking hear it.

20:44.176 --> 20:47.113
- Your wagon, your rules.

20:49.849 --> 20:53.820
- [sniffs]
Gonna cost about...

20:53.820 --> 20:55.087
six hundred to stock up.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.458
- Why six hundred?

20:58.458 --> 21:00.793
- 'Cause this is the last store
'fore we get to Wyoming.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.731
- What about Abilene?

21:04.731 --> 21:07.066
- [laughing]

21:07.066 --> 21:10.603
God damn Abilene.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.172
Hookers and killers
is all you'll find there.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.541
I ain't going near
that sum bitch.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.410
Mm-mmm.

21:18.210 --> 21:21.247
[background chatter]

21:22.915 --> 21:24.216
- [sighs]

21:35.495 --> 21:38.398
- Oh, Lord Jesus,
be with me.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.301
[laughing]

21:50.410 --> 21:54.947
[music]

21:54.947 --> 21:58.951
- You know, there's going
to be a school here next year.

21:58.951 --> 22:02.389
Ten years
there wasn't nothing,

22:02.389 --> 22:04.891
not a soul in this country.
- Mm.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.826
- And now there's gonna
be a school.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.828
[laughs]
That's progress.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.297
- I'm not even sure I know
what that word means anymore.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.868
[chuckles]

22:18.070 --> 22:19.305
- Nobody does!

22:19.305 --> 22:21.107
[cackling]

22:31.418 --> 22:32.519
- Miss Carol?

22:34.086 --> 22:36.956
Miss Carol,
I need to supply up!

22:36.956 --> 22:40.693
- Write down what you take.
I'll be there in a minute.

22:43.262 --> 22:45.331
- Write down what you take?

22:48.300 --> 22:50.036
All right!

22:53.940 --> 22:58.611
[music]

22:58.611 --> 23:01.481
[indistinct chatter]

23:13.159 --> 23:15.795
- Give you 35 dollars
for all of it.

23:15.795 --> 23:18.931
- I'll take it.
- All right.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.700
You want cash
or you wanna trade?

23:20.700 --> 23:21.868
- Cash.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.003
- All right.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.047
[music]

23:39.552 --> 23:41.053
Pretty.

23:42.622 --> 23:45.725
- Uh-huh.
From France.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.327
- What you doing with it?

23:48.327 --> 23:49.962
- Mister, if you ain't
got money

23:49.962 --> 23:51.964
and you ain't got
beans or coffee

23:51.964 --> 23:54.801
or a pot to boil it in,
people will trade away anything.

23:54.801 --> 23:57.269
Further away you get
from concrete,

23:57.269 --> 23:59.205
the more worthless
those pretty things become.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.310
- How much for it?

24:04.310 --> 24:07.113
- Fifty dollars.
- Fifty dollars?

24:07.113 --> 24:09.749
Ain't no damn concrete
'round here.

24:09.749 --> 24:12.885
- 'Cause when I take it to
the concrete it's worth 50.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.623
- Tell you what.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.160
Here's 15.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.232
Keep that 35
and we're even.

24:31.003 --> 24:37.043
[music]

24:46.519 --> 24:48.888
Colton: All the way
to Oregon with them?

24:48.888 --> 24:51.223
Shea: That's the plan.

24:51.223 --> 24:54.226
Who taught 'em how
to hitch a wagon?

24:54.226 --> 24:57.630
- These folks
are a work in progress.

24:57.630 --> 25:00.099
- Well, I'd say
you ain't there yet.

25:02.569 --> 25:03.570
- Nope.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.974
- You all have any trouble
with bandits?

25:07.974 --> 25:10.509
- We had our share.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.211
- How'd they handle it?

25:12.211 --> 25:14.914
- They're here aren't they?

25:14.914 --> 25:16.849
- It's gonna get worse.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.852
And once you get to Wyoming?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.253
Every sorry bastard on this
earth is hid out

25:21.253 --> 25:22.955
in that son of a bitch.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.692
And the Indians ain't as tame
as the papers say they is.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.326
- So people keep telling me.

25:27.326 --> 25:31.230
- Look, Captain...

25:31.230 --> 25:32.999
I been in my fair share
of gunfights

25:32.999 --> 25:37.003
and I ain't trying
to get in another one.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.370
I ju--I don't...

25:43.042 --> 25:44.110
Hundred a month you say?

25:47.714 --> 25:48.915
- Yep.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.917
- How's the food?

25:50.917 --> 25:53.185
- If we can get Cookie hired
it's the same food

25:53.185 --> 25:54.621
you been eatin'.

25:54.621 --> 25:55.722
- I'll ride the trail with you.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.959
- Grab yourgear.
Toss it in that second wagon.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.061
- Well, everything I own
is strapped to this saddle.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.696
- [chuckles]

26:08.768 --> 26:11.237
- I thought you was working
with Swenson?

26:11.237 --> 26:14.040
- We're riding a herd
up in March.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.676
- How are them rivers?

26:16.676 --> 26:18.645
- Rank.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.212
How's Abilene?

26:20.212 --> 26:23.415
- Well, made it out
with my wallet

26:23.415 --> 26:26.452
which is better'd I can say
for of my outfit.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.287
- You hiring on with us?

26:28.287 --> 26:30.657
- Yeah. Got nothing
better to do.

26:33.059 --> 26:36.629
What's her deal?
She's pretty sporty.

26:36.629 --> 26:41.000
- She was paired up with Ennis
till a Comanchero shot him.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.303
She plugged that son of a bitch
three times in the chest.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.038
- Ennis got killed?

26:48.708 --> 26:50.376
- Yeah, she won't be
in the mood for you.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.313
- They're all
in the mood for me.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.115
[laughs]

26:58.685 --> 27:00.419
[kisses]

27:01.788 --> 27:04.256
[horse approaching]

27:07.226 --> 27:11.297
Hi. My name's Colton.
What's yours?

27:15.634 --> 27:17.970
[laughs]

27:17.970 --> 27:19.105
What do I call ya?

27:21.473 --> 27:22.508
- You don't.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.081
Ennis was a friend of mine.

27:29.081 --> 27:33.252
[music]

27:36.823 --> 27:38.024
He was a good hand.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.260
I'm sorry he's gone.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.697
- Me too.

27:46.232 --> 27:52.504
- If...if I can do anything...

27:52.504 --> 27:53.439
let me know.

27:57.576 --> 27:58.911
- There's nothing to do.

28:04.016 --> 28:04.917
- Ma'am.

28:16.662 --> 28:19.031
They was more than paired up.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.600
She's in mourning
like a damn widow.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.303
- She is a widow.

28:24.303 --> 28:28.140
[music]

28:49.495 --> 28:50.562
- Girl...

28:52.298 --> 28:55.134
You go looking for trouble,
you gonna find it every time.

29:00.639 --> 29:03.009
- I wasn't looking for nuthin'
and it still found me.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.749
- [deep breath]

29:15.021 --> 29:16.889
- We should have
a look at the river.

29:17.689 --> 29:18.757
- Take John to your mom.

29:20.692 --> 29:21.627
- She ain't back yet.

29:25.798 --> 29:29.168
[music]

29:35.207 --> 29:36.542
- Hold him for me?

29:59.866 --> 30:01.400
[door squeaks]

30:04.303 --> 30:06.038
[women laughing]

30:09.441 --> 30:11.043
- Don't make any sense.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.812
- [women laughing]

30:16.348 --> 30:17.483
- [sighs]

30:19.018 --> 30:22.488
Give me a minute.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.024
Margaret: Two, three...
[glasses clink]

30:25.024 --> 30:26.825
Carol: Look at you!
Margaret: Oh my God.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.595
- [laughing]
Margaret: Oh my God.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.463
- I've never seen that before.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.934
Never seen it before!

30:36.368 --> 30:38.170
- Hey.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.075
I gotta go study the river.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.077
[laughing]

30:46.645 --> 30:50.549
Margaret (slurring):
Study the river.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.451
- Can I trust you to stay here?

30:52.451 --> 30:56.422
- Yep. This long.
As long as this is.

30:56.422 --> 31:00.059
[cackling]

31:00.059 --> 31:02.929
Carol: Awmo study the river...
Margaret: Oh no...

31:02.929 --> 31:05.364
I think I'm in trouble
but I don't care.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.499
[Carolyn slurring]

31:07.499 --> 31:09.301
[laughing]

31:10.036 --> 31:10.970
- Whoa!

31:16.775 --> 31:18.177
Thomas: Damn.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.080
- They won't ever make it.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.084
James: We'll run the cattle
across first,

31:25.084 --> 31:27.453
take the wagons
over one-by-one.

31:27.453 --> 31:30.556
And I mean us.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.124
It'll take all day,

31:32.124 --> 31:36.128
but we'll lose half of them
if we let them emigrants do it.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.997
- How we getting
them emigrants across?

31:40.699 --> 31:43.335
That'll take all day, too.

31:43.335 --> 31:47.173
- At least nobody drowns.
- That's two days we don't have.

31:47.173 --> 31:50.542
We should be in Kansas by now.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.545
At some point they gotta learn
to do things for themselves.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.314
- The only thing they're
gonna learn crossing that

31:55.314 --> 31:57.083
is how to die.

31:58.650 --> 32:05.557
[music]

32:05.557 --> 32:07.093
- Don't think this
is the place to try

32:07.093 --> 32:08.494
and teach 'em
something, Captain.

32:08.494 --> 32:12.398
- It's this to the Rockies,
and then it's worse.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.134
If they can't cross
a fucking river,

32:15.134 --> 32:16.835
how are they gonna cross
the mountains

32:16.835 --> 32:19.505
or the goddam desert
we go through first?

32:19.505 --> 32:21.173
- Don't get mad.

32:21.173 --> 32:24.943
We ain't gotta do
what the farmer say.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.280
If you wanna swim 'em
across the river,

32:28.280 --> 32:30.082
then we'll swim 'em
across the river.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.587
- I'm mad 'cause he's right.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.606
[music]

33:12.924 --> 33:14.360
[Margaret groans]

33:20.099 --> 33:23.635
(crying) Wherever we're going
it better be paradise...

33:23.635 --> 33:26.638
'Cause it's costing
us a daughter...

33:29.875 --> 33:32.244
If you ask me,
it's a shitty trade.

33:32.244 --> 33:33.645
- We ain't trading nuthin'.

33:33.645 --> 33:34.713
- She killed a man.

33:37.216 --> 33:38.684
And she was about
to kill another.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.921
I look in her eyes

33:42.921 --> 33:46.992
and the person staring back
at me, I don't recognize.

33:46.992 --> 33:49.261
I will never forgive
you for this!

33:49.261 --> 33:50.862
You don't forgive me?

33:52.331 --> 33:53.499
I don't forgive me.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.778
[music]

34:48.554 --> 34:50.856
- You didn't see the way
he was looking at me.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.230
Wouldn't matter if you did.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.402
Men don't know how
to read that look.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.671
Only know how to give it.

35:11.177 --> 35:14.946
- I'm gonna tell you a story
and you're gonna listen.

35:17.916 --> 35:19.285
I think I've earned that right.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.288
Hope I have.

35:22.288 --> 35:24.356
- I'll listen.

35:29.395 --> 35:30.862
- First man I killed...hm...

35:34.966 --> 35:36.067
He was just a boy.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.505
Younger than you.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.144
The reason companies
have flag bearers

35:46.144 --> 35:48.947
is so soldiers know
to stay with their group.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.650
And generals on the hill

35:51.650 --> 35:54.553
can track the progress
of the battle.

35:54.553 --> 35:58.457
So much dust and smoke
in battle.

36:00.091 --> 36:01.427
You're fighting in a fog.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.230
It's hard to
make out the enemy.

36:04.230 --> 36:07.666
Can't tell your men
from theirs.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.035
But you can always look up
and see the flags.

36:17.443 --> 36:19.311
So, we shoot
flag bearers first.

36:22.348 --> 36:23.749
And I did.

36:26.084 --> 36:28.720
That boy's face
was burned into my brain.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.890
The whole world seemed to stop

36:31.890 --> 36:35.994
as this boy,
he's looking right at me.

36:35.994 --> 36:38.230
[music]

36:38.230 --> 36:40.499
By the end of the battle, I...

36:42.934 --> 36:44.503
I'd killed so many men.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.839
I couldn't remember
what that boy looked like.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.145
Still can't.

36:57.949 --> 37:01.019
That man you shot
was already dead.

37:03.855 --> 37:07.659
Whether we hanged him
or he bled out,

37:07.659 --> 37:09.761
his time on this earth was done.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.134
You did not kill him.

37:18.304 --> 37:19.471
Understand?

37:22.808 --> 37:25.311
The meanest thing
you can do to yourself

37:25.311 --> 37:26.912
is hate somebody else.

37:28.347 --> 37:31.783
I know what it feels like
to hate the world.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.452
You don't want
to feel it, honey.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.388
Be sad.
Miss him.

37:37.389 --> 37:38.890
Cry yourself blind.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.160
But you leave the hating to me.

37:45.397 --> 37:48.133
[music]

38:26.905 --> 38:28.674
- I got 35 dollars.

38:31.209 --> 38:34.580
Wish it was more,
but it was fair.

38:36.782 --> 38:38.550
- There's stew in the pot
if you're hungry.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.420
- I am.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.668
Where'd you find meat?

38:56.668 --> 38:59.371
- It's rabbit.

38:59.371 --> 39:00.706
I figured out the shotgun.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.814
- Don't taste like rabbit.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.550
- Mostly rabbit.
- What else is it?

39:12.250 --> 39:13.719
- Rattlesnake.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.622
Figured than one out, too.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.190
- Got you something.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.791
- Why would you buy me this?

39:53.792 --> 39:55.026
- Well...

39:57.729 --> 39:59.465
If I looked like you, I...

40:01.467 --> 40:04.936
figure I'd stare at myself...

40:04.936 --> 40:07.005
every chance I got.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.779
- This is a present.

40:13.779 --> 40:15.781
- Yes, it is.

40:15.781 --> 40:19.451
- You won't marry me.

40:19.451 --> 40:22.153
You won't love me,

40:22.153 --> 40:23.722
but you will buy me gifts.

40:24.756 --> 40:28.860
- You're sad...
and scared.

40:32.731 --> 40:34.533
You have every right to be.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.971
If I can give you something
that makes you happy

40:39.971 --> 40:42.173
and protect you...

40:44.309 --> 40:45.577
Don't see the crime in it.

40:47.412 --> 40:48.714
- You want me happy.

40:50.381 --> 40:51.617
- Course I do.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.352
- You want me to feel safe.

40:56.722 --> 40:57.723
- Yes, ma'am.

41:20.211 --> 41:21.412
- That's love.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.316
[music]

41:25.316 --> 41:28.620
Me letting you take care
of me is not fear.

41:30.355 --> 41:31.890
It's loving you back.

41:36.327 --> 41:39.464
[music]

41:57.482 --> 41:58.684
Do I look scared to you?

42:14.700 --> 42:16.134
I'm not the scared one.

42:20.105 --> 42:20.939
You are.

42:56.675 --> 42:59.745
[music]

43:03.548 --> 43:05.383
- I laid in the grass...

43:09.788 --> 43:11.122
closed my eyes...

43:14.025 --> 43:15.326
and I saw him.

43:19.197 --> 43:20.799
Laughed at his goofy hair.

43:24.102 --> 43:26.271
Felt the electricity
of his touch.

43:31.476 --> 43:35.280
I laid in the grass
and I loved him.

43:38.917 --> 43:42.654
[music]

43:45.556 --> 43:46.992
Then I opened my eyes...

43:50.862 --> 43:52.698
and I could see color again.

44:00.772 --> 44:02.741
[cow lowing]
Colton: Ch-ch-ch-ch...

44:02.741 --> 44:05.276
[music]

44:05.276 --> 44:06.678
Colton: Hup hup!

44:08.880 --> 44:10.949
Hup, hup...
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...

44:20.458 --> 44:22.493
Elsa: Elsa.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.362
- What's that?

44:24.362 --> 44:26.932
- That's my name.

44:26.932 --> 44:30.869
- It'll come in handy
to know it.

44:30.869 --> 44:32.804
- Don't bother flirting with me.

44:32.804 --> 44:34.639
- Why not?

44:34.639 --> 44:38.576
- You're too pretty for me.
I prefer to be the pretty one.

44:41.279 --> 44:43.782
Ch-ch-ch-ch...
[clicks tongue]

44:46.317 --> 44:48.253
Bet you prefer it too.

44:48.253 --> 44:50.388
- [laughs]
- Ch-ch...

44:55.827 --> 44:58.797
James: You drive my horse
across the river,

44:58.797 --> 44:59.831
I'll drive the wagon.

44:59.831 --> 45:02.033
- [sigh]
I am perfectly capable.

45:02.033 --> 45:04.469
- I ain't questioning
what you're able to do.

45:04.469 --> 45:06.905
There's three times
as many things that can go wrong

45:06.905 --> 45:09.407
in the water with that.

45:09.407 --> 45:13.078
Now, you can not forgive me
all you want.

45:13.078 --> 45:15.313
Add this to
your list of reasons.

45:15.313 --> 45:16.748
But I ain't losing
you to a river.

45:19.417 --> 45:20.718
- You're forgiven.

45:30.661 --> 45:33.832
[music]

45:33.832 --> 45:36.167
[German and Slavic chatter]

46:25.083 --> 46:26.217
- Good morning.

46:28.186 --> 46:29.720
- Mornin', ma'am.

47:00.251 --> 47:01.920
- No more "ma'am."

47:01.920 --> 47:05.991
[music]

47:05.991 --> 47:07.425
Noemi.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.361
Good morning, Noemi.

47:13.865 --> 47:18.003
- Mornin'...
Noemi.

47:28.546 --> 47:41.726
[music]

47:48.733 --> 47:51.336
[indistinct chatter]

48:12.924 --> 48:15.360
- The spring's back
in your step, I see.

48:15.360 --> 48:17.895
- You're the only person
who talked to me about him.

48:21.466 --> 48:22.900
Thank you.

48:27.838 --> 48:30.775
[music]

48:30.775 --> 48:34.612
[horse nickers]
Shhh.

48:34.612 --> 48:36.381
- He don't like the water, huh?

48:36.381 --> 48:40.051
- [laughs]
- He's excited.
The water's his favorite part.

48:40.051 --> 48:41.886
- Better let him at it then.
- Okay.

48:42.954 --> 48:44.589
Come on.

48:46.791 --> 48:51.796
[music]

48:54.565 --> 48:56.301
Colton: Come on, cow.
Hup, hup, hup.

48:56.301 --> 48:58.136
Get up, get up, ch-ch-ch...

49:00.771 --> 49:03.408
Hup, hup, hup.
Watch out, watch out.

49:09.680 --> 49:10.948
Come on, cow. Hup, hup.

49:14.885 --> 49:16.254
Shea: Let's bring 'em, boys.

49:24.829 --> 49:26.831
- We were leaving Texas.

49:26.831 --> 49:28.899
Entering the Indian
territory...

49:28.899 --> 49:31.769
and redefining
our meaning of unknown.

49:33.604 --> 49:36.507
Far from the cities that
have paved the world away,

49:36.507 --> 49:39.477
and the farms which
have tamed it into a resource.

49:42.847 --> 49:45.683
We were no longer under
the cloud of civilization.

49:47.085 --> 49:49.087
Only sky above us now.

49:50.155 --> 49:53.191
No more walking over bridges.

49:53.191 --> 49:55.626
Out here, we swim
horseback through rivers.

50:01.199 --> 50:05.570
There is nowhere to chain
love to vows and ceremony.

50:05.570 --> 50:09.507
Out here love burns
through you like a fever.

50:09.507 --> 50:12.377
And when the devil comes
to rip that love from you,

50:12.377 --> 50:15.146
there is no funeral
with somber speeches

50:15.146 --> 50:18.483
that dull our senses
and deaden our hearts.

50:19.884 --> 50:21.919
Out here, you turn
toward the pain

50:21.919 --> 50:24.655
as it tears into you,
and you let it.

50:26.124 --> 50:28.859
When you do,
the devil gets bored.

50:30.195 --> 50:32.063
He seeks another soul to eat.

50:34.532 --> 50:35.966
And you get to live again.

50:38.669 --> 50:41.906
[music]

50:53.318 --> 50:56.587
