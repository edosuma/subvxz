We probably should've talked
about it before she left,

18:35.027 --> 18:36.460
come up with some rules.

18:36.485 --> 18:38.752
I guess we could've learned a
thing or two at that poly party.

18:38.777 --> 18:40.312
Oh, I learned plenty.

18:40.337 --> 18:42.005
Unfortunately, none of it prepared me

18:42.030 --> 18:43.264
for this particular moment.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.665
Me neither.

18:45.552 --> 18:47.669
But I don't think avoiding
each other is the answer.

18:50.948 --> 18:53.615
Bring any pasta with those meatballs?

18:56.555 --> 18:58.322
[Children shouting playfully]

18:58.347 --> 19:00.214
The kitchen had these antique fixtures

19:00.239 --> 19:02.273
dating back to the turn of the century

19:02.298 --> 19:04.298
that your mother thought were boring

19:04.323 --> 19:06.591
and that needed a pop of color.

19:06.616 --> 19:08.150
So she bedazzled them

19:08.175 --> 19:11.010
by supergluing the knobs with sequins.

19:11.035 --> 19:12.162
No way.

19:12.187 --> 19:14.722
<i>One</i> fixture. One
door handle, not all.

19:14.747 --> 19:17.843
Ll, that's not exactly w
I remember it, but okay.

19:18.030 --> 19:20.288
When can I come see <i>your</i> new house?

19:20.619 --> 19:22.754
Well, you're <i>always</i> welcome.

19:22.826 --> 19:23.993
Both of you.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.001
It's hard for me to
leave the store right now,

19:27.026 --> 19:28.459
but I'll look at the calendar.

19:28.484 --> 19:30.919
I can go alone. I'm old enough
to get on a plane by myself.

19:30.944 --> 19:33.259
- Let me think about it.
- She always does that.

19:33.284 --> 19:34.800
I don't always do <i>anything.</i>

19:34.825 --> 19:36.660
You find some reason to say no.

19:36.685 --> 19:38.386
Why can't you look at a calendar right now?

19:38.411 --> 19:39.712
Uh, look at the time.

19:39.737 --> 19:41.137
If we don't get out of here,

19:41.162 --> 19:43.297
we're gonna miss our
mani-pedi appointment.

19:43.322 --> 19:44.622
Lucy, what are you getting?

19:44.647 --> 19:45.747
I don't know.

19:45.772 --> 19:47.539
I hear that orange is the color for spring.

19:47.564 --> 19:48.951
Ooh! Orange.

19:57.639 --> 19:58.639
Oh, my God.

19:58.664 --> 20:01.099
I mean, we should've shot the rehearsal.

20:01.124 --> 20:02.657
I totally could've gotten him there.

20:02.682 --> 20:04.582
The man massaged my shoulders.

20:04.607 --> 20:06.708
Yeah, sounds like he really took to you.

20:06.733 --> 20:08.654
I knew this was gonna work. I told you.

20:08.679 --> 20:10.212
What? I'm a genius.

20:11.659 --> 20:14.094
Can you stop smiling so much?

20:14.119 --> 20:16.793
- Hmm?
- Actually, your whole attitude

20:16.818 --> 20:19.386
is... is really off-putting.

20:19.411 --> 20:21.145
Um...

20:21.170 --> 20:23.171
I'm sorry. Are you mad at me or something?

20:23.196 --> 20:25.697
I just don't understand
why you're so into this.

20:25.953 --> 20:28.288
I mean, it's almost like
you're enjoying the fact

20:28.313 --> 20:31.663
that my husband practically assaulted you

20:31.688 --> 20:33.254
while I'm still in the house.

20:33.279 --> 20:35.404
Okay, I'm not enjoying any... I'm...

20:35.429 --> 20:37.663
Oh, I'm... I'm doing this
for you... to help you.

20:37.688 --> 20:38.888
Really? Why?

20:38.913 --> 20:40.848
Are you really worried
about losing your job?

20:40.873 --> 20:42.473
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:43.551 --> 20:46.217
Um, this has absolutely nothing to do

20:46.242 --> 20:47.609
with losing my job, Calista.

20:47.634 --> 20:48.935
I...

20:48.960 --> 20:50.427
I don't want to lose <i>you.</i>

20:52.015 --> 20:53.883
I already lost my sister, you know?

20:53.908 --> 20:55.708
And you've... you've become

20:55.733 --> 20:57.801
a really important person in my life.

20:57.826 --> 21:00.095
I like having you around.

21:00.312 --> 21:02.914
I like having you around, too.

I'm sorry. I'm re... I'm really sorry.

21:06.696 --> 21:07.772
I was just pissed.

21:07.797 --> 21:10.532
You know, it's hard to see
Luca go after you like that.

21:10.595 --> 21:12.462
I get it.

21:12.487 --> 21:15.159
And I-I should've... I
should've been more sensitive.

21:16.152 --> 21:18.086
You know, if... I-if you
don't want to do this,

21:18.111 --> 21:19.471
I completely understand.

21:19.702 --> 21:21.291
No, screw it.

Let's get the bastard.

You have to try this ribollita.

Mmm.

21:31.012 --> 21:32.746
- Mmm!
- Huh?

21:33.558 --> 21:35.492
I had no idea you lived abroad.

21:35.517 --> 21:37.619
There's a lot of things
about me you don't know.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.011
I'm a man of mystery.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.603
Is that so?

21:40.628 --> 21:42.762
All right, maybe a man
of not so much mystery.

21:42.787 --> 21:44.884
But I did do a semester
abroad when I was at Duke.

21:44.909 --> 21:46.343
Amazing.

21:46.368 --> 21:49.703
For a minute, I really thought
about just staying in Italy,

21:49.728 --> 21:51.262
dropping out altogether.

21:51.287 --> 21:52.821
Why didn't you?

No. Not really. But she was right.

they all put their name on
something besides their food.

23:02.870 --> 23:03.971
That's what I need to do.

23:03.996 --> 23:06.531
I am so up to this task.
I got a ton of ideas.

23:06.556 --> 23:07.656
None of them food-related per se,

23:07.681 --> 23:09.215

out a way to get my name out there.

teaching a cooking class?

is not a terrible idea.

Maybe I can could get
Joe Zee to tweet about it.

23:28.269 --> 23:31.085

few social-media sites,

Really? Flowers? That's
a bit much, isn't it?

23:49.336 --> 23:50.704

come to a cooking class

27:13.658 --> 27:15.941
Driving drunk with a
toddler is not an accident.

27:15.966 --> 27:17.167
It is a felony.

27:17.192 --> 27:18.993
But I guess those rules don't apply to you.

27:19.018 --> 27:20.819
Okay, you're above the law, right?

27:20.844 --> 27:23.513
- For you, it's just another "no big deal."
- For the millionth time,

27:23.538 --> 27:25.831
I wasn't drunk. I had two
glasses of wine with dinner.

27:25.856 --> 27:28.438
- I'm not having this conversation with you.
- What conversation?!

27:28.463 --> 27:30.154
You have a drinking problem,

27:30.179 --> 27:32.446
and the fact that you
still don't see that?!

27:32.471 --> 27:34.039
I can't see what isn't there.

27:34.535 --> 27:36.003
You know what?

27:36.399 --> 27:39.934
I thought that you had finally
moved past all this nonsense.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.243
If you still feel that
way, why did you invite me?

27:42.268 --> 27:44.540
Truthfully, it wasn't my idea.

27:46.129 --> 27:50.261
And as far as I'm concerned,
you have no place in my home.

28:13.254 --> 28:16.384
Now, you need to start
with a, uh, a good base.

28:16.409 --> 28:19.416
Can anyone give me an example
of a-a good dressing base?

28:21.943 --> 28:23.711
Like, when y-you go to a restaurant,

28:23.736 --> 28:25.970

28:26.038 --> 28:28.433
[Breathes deeply] Olive oil.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.013

how to make your soufflé.

chefs to perform one skill.

29:00.013 --> 29:01.261

Sometimes the hardest
thing about being a parent
