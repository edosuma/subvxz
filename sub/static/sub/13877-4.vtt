C'mon, get outta there!

00:53.630 --> 00:54.570
Get outta there! Go!

00:54.630 --> 00:56.470
It's a new world record!

00:56.530 --> 00:57.480
One million points!

00:57.530 --> 00:59.000
Oh, no. Up that rim!

00:59.010 --> 01:00.710
I'm doing this as hard as I can.

01:00.710 --> 01:02.070
Ooh! I did that!

01:02.070 --> 01:02.740
I just did it.

01:02.740 --> 01:05.540
I should not
walk so a child may live!

01:05.560 --> 01:06.960
And that multi-ball!

01:08.170 --> 01:08.930
What the hell, man?

01:08.940 --> 01:09.590
When did you get this?

01:09.620 --> 01:10.480
I had it made.

01:10.730 --> 01:13.490
The Family Guy has one,
so why not me?

01:14.450 --> 01:16.400
Based on my incredible
adventures.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.320
'Cause you don't have
any incredible adventures.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.410
I am a modern day Tom Sawyer.

01:20.480 --> 01:24.080
Look, it has 18 flippers,

01:24.950 --> 01:26.550
each with a button.

01:27.780 --> 01:31.730
The foot pedals control
the angle of the board.

01:31.790 --> 01:35.530
The ball, shaped like the ovum
of a flightless bird.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.560
A fountain in the middle

01:37.630 --> 01:41.730
to commemorate that time
when I stole all them pennies.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.330
And my favorite feature...

01:43.400 --> 01:45.170
it's impossible to tilt.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.210
Watch this.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.140
It doesn't tilt!

01:50.210 --> 01:51.150
It doesn't work now, either.

01:51.210 --> 01:52.240
You have tilted, jerk!

01:52.310 --> 01:53.250
No! My baby!

01:53.310 --> 01:54.250
Yeah. Goodnight.

01:55.310 --> 01:56.250
You bastard!

01:56.310 --> 01:57.850
You brought this on us!

01:59.520 --> 02:01.760
Little sticky on the 7th
flipper.

02:01.820 --> 02:04.230
This is working all right.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.560
Oh, that's weird.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.230
It's playing slow.

02:09.289 --> 02:11.270
Oh, wait a minute,
there's no ball in it.

02:11.330 --> 02:12.500
It's a eggball

02:12.560 --> 02:15.040
It's a egg from this flightless
bird I met.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.040
Mmm, these is some good eggs.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.040
- No!
- They hard, though.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.040
My multi-ball!

02:19.100 --> 02:21.580
I'm whipping up a Denver
multi-ball, if you want one.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.950
Don't you worry.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.010
I always have an extra.

02:27.780 --> 02:28.720
There you go.

02:28.780 --> 02:29.720
How about that?

02:29.780 --> 02:31.590
No! It's a eggball!

02:31.650 --> 02:32.720
It came outta the ass of this

02:32.780 --> 02:34.890
flightless bird I met
and you don't know 'em!

02:34.950 --> 02:36.900
Oh, I don't have one
of those.

02:36.950 --> 02:37.900
You must!

02:37.950 --> 02:40.260
This is based on my wonderful
adventures.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.620
Uh, let me have a look
in the truck.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.340
Okay, here's another idea.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.140
I suggest we go find one
of them birds you talkin' 'bout,

02:50.200 --> 02:53.670
and raise it, and nurture it
and feed it grains and hamburger,

02:53.740 --> 02:57.180
and have it lay you some of them
balls for your game.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.420
That's your suggestion.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.450
Yeah, that's it.

03:01.510 --> 03:03.110
Well, it's a damned good one.

03:03.180 --> 03:05.120
Tonight, you may spank yourself.

03:05.180 --> 03:06.120
Frylock.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.130
I don't know what kinda bird
you're talking about.

03:08.180 --> 03:10.290
You know, it's a rare one.

03:10.350 --> 03:13.130
With the feet that are colored.

03:13.190 --> 03:14.130
You know, come on!

03:14.190 --> 03:15.130
Just get on it.

03:15.190 --> 03:16.130
I don't understand what...

03:16.190 --> 03:18.100
Damn it! It's my vision!

03:18.160 --> 03:19.610
Make it so!

03:19.660 --> 03:21.610
Are you asking me to do
something?

03:21.660 --> 03:22.610
Is this a command?

03:22.660 --> 03:23.610
Never mind!

03:24.670 --> 03:26.410
You call yourself a man?

03:26.470 --> 03:27.950
Then follow me!

03:30.470 --> 03:32.780
Well, this is most
likely where I found him.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.220
Where the hell are we, Shake?

03:34.280 --> 03:35.220
I don't know!

03:35.280 --> 03:36.590
This is uncharted.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.390
You think Donald Trump knows
where all his stuff is?

03:39.450 --> 03:40.390
No!

03:40.450 --> 03:42.120
And that guy's on television.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.160
Look, y'all.

03:43.220 --> 03:44.860
Look at this map.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.030
And now look at this guy.

03:47.090 --> 03:49.540
And then,
look at that over there.

03:49.590 --> 03:51.070
And now look at my finger.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.610
I got me a booger on it.

03:53.660 --> 03:54.610
Unrelated.

03:54.660 --> 03:55.610
But I do like boogers.

03:55.660 --> 03:56.700
Shh, shh! Shh, shh!

03:58.000 --> 04:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:09.180 --> 04:10.920
That's where it ends.

04:10.980 --> 04:12.120
I'm gon' get me a tan.

04:12.180 --> 04:13.120
No, Meatwad.

04:13.180 --> 04:14.850
Not without a 45 SPF, you don't.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.420
Maybe it's because of
the ultraviolet rays

04:16.490 --> 04:17.959
that they call
it Death Island.

04:18.019 --> 04:20.130
Or it could be all them
skeletons.

04:20.190 --> 04:21.130
That too.

04:21.190 --> 04:22.130
Hey, here's some sunblock!

04:22.190 --> 04:24.140
Right here in the old vending
machine.

04:24.190 --> 04:25.140
Oh, hang on.

04:25.190 --> 04:26.140
I think I got 55 cents.

04:26.190 --> 04:27.230
No, no, no.
Let me get this.

04:29.870 --> 04:30.810
All right.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.170
The trail mix, sticky rolls,

04:32.230 --> 04:34.840
and Dr. Fudge-be-gone are
all mine.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.180
Let me have that Dr. Fudge...

04:36.240 --> 04:37.580
No! Pull a fish from the ocean

04:37.640 --> 04:39.480
and skin it with your
tooth.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.350
You ain't even eating
that Smacker bar!

04:41.410 --> 04:43.480
I'm gonna save this for
myself for later.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.120
Shake, is this that bird
you were looking for?

04:46.180 --> 04:47.290
Nah.

04:51.190 --> 04:52.130
Well, look a there.

04:52.190 --> 04:54.130
He just farted out a bunch
of pinball eggs.

04:54.190 --> 04:55.130
Yeah, Meatwad's right, man.

04:55.190 --> 04:56.130
They are pinballs.

04:56.190 --> 04:58.140
No, no, no. Mine
are totally different.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.140
These will not work.

04:59.190 --> 05:00.140
Oh, come on, Shake, look.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.440
The thing's laying pinball eggs.

05:03.330 --> 05:04.740
Slay him for food!

05:05.870 --> 05:10.910
J" I'm singing bye bye ♪

05:10.970 --> 05:14.320
♪ Deep dish pepperoni pizza ♪

05:14.380 --> 05:20.290
♪ Who got the extra large slice
filled with pepperoni ♪

05:22.250 --> 05:23.920
Come on, everybody!

05:23.990 --> 05:24.930
I am bored.

05:24.990 --> 05:25.930
Let's go back home.

05:25.990 --> 05:26.930
We parachuted here.

05:26.990 --> 05:27.930
Yeah, I know.

05:27.990 --> 05:28.990
Because it was cheaper.

05:29.060 --> 05:30.260
The tickets said one way.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.670
Round trip was insane!

05:32.730 --> 05:33.900
You wanna pay those prices?

05:33.960 --> 05:34.910
Be my guest.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.640
Had we rented the boat like I
wanted,

05:36.700 --> 05:38.300
we could get back
in the boat and go home.

05:38.370 --> 05:40.310
Well, we didn't do that,
did we?

05:40.370 --> 05:43.320
Because someone didn't assert
themselves enough.

05:43.370 --> 05:45.440
I keep telling you to read
my book.

05:45.510 --> 05:49.680
"Master Your Finances
and Shake It Up."

05:49.750 --> 05:52.920
Chapter one... make every
problem your slave.

05:52.980 --> 05:54.930
Seriously, did you even
pick it up?

05:54.980 --> 05:56.930
Yeah, we got a garage
full of them.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.260
That's 'cause they didn't
sell 'cause...

05:58.320 --> 05:59.420
Hey, y'all.

05:59.490 --> 06:00.930
You shut the website down!

06:00.990 --> 06:02.330
We could take these jet skis
over here.

06:02.390 --> 06:03.430
Shut up, Meatwad!

06:03.490 --> 06:05.230
I'm discussing my book over
here.

06:05.290 --> 06:06.240
All right, Shake, you win.

06:06.290 --> 06:07.930
How do you make this problem
your slave?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.240
Well, I'll tell you.

06:09.300 --> 06:12.770
"Rule one...
assess the situation."

06:12.830 --> 06:13.780
We are fucked.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.940
Y'all see these jet skis?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.040
"Rule two...
Apply blame."

06:18.110 --> 06:19.920
You, Frylock. You're the one.

06:19.980 --> 06:20.920
What about these jet skis?

06:20.980 --> 06:21.920
"Rule three...

06:21.980 --> 06:25.150
Don't let the blamee hear
about you blaming them."

06:25.210 --> 06:27.850
Hey, Meatwad, Frylock really
jobbed us on this, didn't he?

06:27.920 --> 06:29.090
You probably shouldn't say that

06:29.150 --> 06:31.190
with him standing right
there.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.200
You see these jet skis...

06:32.250 --> 06:34.930
"Rule four...
Make a suggestion,

06:34.990 --> 06:37.900
but don't own up to it
in case it sucks."

06:37.960 --> 06:41.630
Hey, guys, what if we make
a boat out of sand?

06:41.700 --> 06:44.300
But it's a glass-bottom boat.

06:44.370 --> 06:47.610
Then we could host tours
for this roasted bird

06:47.670 --> 06:50.410
and get money to buy
a plane ticket outta here

06:50.470 --> 06:52.680
from an airport that does
not exist.

06:52.740 --> 06:53.980
That idea sucks.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.720
Yeah, I know.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.050
Who's idea was that, Meatwad?

06:57.110 --> 06:59.060
Two jet skis right over
here.

06:59.110 --> 07:00.680
Which leads me to rule four.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.290
"Take well-deserved nap."

07:03.350 --> 07:05.160
Good night. Good luck.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.290
The end.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.500
So we doing the jet skis...

07:09.560 --> 07:11.500
Do you like to hear your own
voice?

07:11.560 --> 07:12.800
'Cause I'm trying to sleep!

07:12.860 --> 07:15.870
You write a book, and tell me
it doesn't make you tired!

07:15.930 --> 07:18.070
Shh, shh!

07:18.130 --> 07:19.110
What the hell is that?

07:19.170 --> 07:20.040
Go to bed!

07:23.770 --> 07:25.720
Thank goodness I found
these jet skis, right?

07:25.770 --> 07:26.720
Oh, definitely man.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.720
What do you think them
crazy sounds was?

07:28.780 --> 07:31.220
You know, normally I'd be
curious, but I'm not.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.230
Ain't you just a little
worried about Shake?

07:33.280 --> 07:34.690
- Nope.
- Me neither.

07:34.750 --> 07:37.290
Here, help me grab his stuff
and take it to the curb.

07:38.190 --> 07:39.760
You need to bend with your legs.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.400
Classic rule five.

07:43.460 --> 07:48.070
Ignore existence of dilemma,
and it shall go away.

07:48.130 --> 07:49.070
Wait a minute.

07:52.770 --> 07:54.270
You bought my book?

07:54.900 --> 07:58.010
Congratulations, you are well
on your way to living

07:58.070 --> 07:59.920
a healthy life at the expense of
others.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.650
Yeah, bawk bawk bawk!

08:06.720 --> 08:08.960
I don't understand stupid
chicken talk.

08:09.020 --> 08:12.290
Now untie me immediately so
I can autograph that damn book

08:12.350 --> 08:13.390
for your stupid nephew.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.490
What's his name, Sammy?

08:17.990 --> 08:19.130
Wait a minute.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.470
Ow ow ow! Ow ow ow!
Ow ow ow ow!

08:25.530 --> 08:27.140
Ow ow ow!
Ow ow ow ow!

08:27.200 --> 08:28.040
Ow ow ow!

08:28.100 --> 08:29.670
Ow ow! Ow ow ow ow!

08:29.740 --> 08:32.909
Ow ow ow! Ow ow ow!
Ow ow ow! Ow ow ow!

08:43.150 --> 08:47.460
I do not understand
what you are saying to me!

08:49.190 --> 08:50.790
What? What's that again!

08:57.200 --> 08:58.270
Speak English!

08:58.330 --> 09:00.440
Why is that not a law everywhere?!

09:00.500 --> 09:02.540
He speaks only in turkey
clucks.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.550
He's an idiot.

09:05.970 --> 09:07.040
What's going on, man?

09:08.840 --> 09:11.290
He's saying our god Rudy
is angry.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.450
Rudy?
Who the hell is Rudy?

09:14.580 --> 09:15.580
He's saying run!

09:27.800 --> 09:31.210
All right, what do you want,
you big gay baby!

09:41.580 --> 09:45.290
All right, what do you want,
you big gay baby?!

09:47.550 --> 09:48.580
Good idea, Lyle,

09:48.650 --> 09:49.860
let's set up a web cam

09:49.920 --> 09:51.920
so everybody can watch a giant
gay baby

09:51.990 --> 09:54.160
blow up another tourist
with his lasers.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.170
Come on you don't know he's gay.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.900
Isn't that what he called
him?

09:56.960 --> 09:58.840
I mean, he called him that,
that doesn't mean he's gay.

09:58.890 --> 09:59.930
He called him gay.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.600
I just think we should change
the name.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.400
I mean, Death Island
is not an inviting name.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.410
Well, Fantasy Island
is taken!

10:05.470 --> 10:06.910
Life Island would be better.

10:06.970 --> 10:09.570
I mean, it's not great, but it's
way better than Death Island.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.680
Someone has to destroy
that baby.

10:12.510 --> 10:13.950
And he's probably gay.

10:14.010 --> 10:16.620
But we tried to destroy Rudy
for hundreds of years.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.280
We were hoping
he would grow and mature

10:18.350 --> 10:19.980
and learn not
to destroy tourists.

10:20.050 --> 10:20.990
But he doesn't learn!

10:21.050 --> 10:23.000
Well, look, I don't know what
to tell you.

10:23.050 --> 10:24.290
The benadryl missiles
didn't work

10:24.350 --> 10:26.760
and the nitroglycerine
rattle went nowhere.

10:26.820 --> 10:28.430
He loves it, though.

10:28.490 --> 10:29.430
Have you seen him with it?

10:29.490 --> 10:30.440
Yes, Frederick.

10:30.490 --> 10:31.870
He gets bigger by the millenium.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.270
Hmm.

10:33.330 --> 10:35.000
I'm just throwing stuff
at the wall right now,

10:35.060 --> 10:37.510
but let's build
a giant daycare center

10:37.570 --> 10:38.510
and put him in it.

10:38.570 --> 10:39.510
What the fuck?!

10:39.570 --> 10:40.550
The island is gone!

10:40.600 --> 10:42.140
That's a stupid idea, Lyle.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.770
Oh, I didn't come up with it,
I'm just thinking out loud.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.550
Gimme that book!

10:48.540 --> 10:49.750
Okay,
here's what we're gonna do,

10:49.810 --> 10:53.950
we'll all take naps
and hope this goes away.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.600
We should definitely have him
tested.

11:05.660 --> 11:08.370
Developmentally he's not quite
with the other gay babies.

11:08.430 --> 11:11.340
I'm not having doctor's
poking around in my gay baby.
