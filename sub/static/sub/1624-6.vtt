WEBVTT

00:02.124 --> 00:03.359
Here you go, Earl.

00:03.395 --> 00:06.598
Table 12 throwing down
a credit card on a patty melt.

00:06.599 --> 00:09.934
They really need
those eight airline miles?

00:09.935 --> 00:12.003
Where they going... New Jersey?

00:12.004 --> 00:15.206
Credit cards are the downfall of America.

00:15.207 --> 00:19.344
Well, credit cards and Kim Kardashian.

00:19.345 --> 00:23.581
I like her big ass
as much as the next man,

00:23.582 --> 00:27.886
but don't go give
the damn butt a franchise.

00:27.887 --> 00:31.155
Max, I can take a lot.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.891
Please keep your sex life to yourself.

00:32.892 --> 00:35.793
I handled it
when I lost my fortune,

00:35.794 --> 00:37.729
and I handled it
when I lost my fortune.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.330
You said that twice.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.633
Because I think it bears repeating.

00:41.634 --> 00:43.167
But this is too much.

00:43.168 --> 00:48.773
That couple that just left...
a $50 check, a $1.47 tip.

00:48.774 --> 00:50.508
47 cents?

00:50.509 --> 00:52.944
Uh, I wasn't even aware they
were still making pennies.

00:52.945 --> 00:57.882
I smiled and bent over
backwards, giving them service...

00:57.883 --> 01:00.518
all for $1.47?

01:00.519 --> 01:03.788
This makes me the lowest-paid
hooker in New York.

01:03.789 --> 01:06.858
All right, give me that check.
I'll handle this.

01:11.797 --> 01:13.031
Hey!

01:13.032 --> 01:14.799
Was something wrong with the service

01:14.800 --> 01:16.234
my girl over here gave you?

01:16.235 --> 01:18.903
No. Tipping's an option.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.972
So is me spitting in your food.

01:20.973 --> 01:22.106
You might want to remember that

01:22.107 --> 01:24.609
the next time you leave
a waitress pennies.

01:24.610 --> 01:26.277
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

01:26.278 --> 01:29.547
This was our first
and <i>last</i> date.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.349
Sorry, dude.

01:31.350 --> 01:32.583
Looks like this little tip

01:32.584 --> 01:37.155
just lost you the chance
to give her your little tip.

01:52.879 --> 01:53.936
Max, come in, sit down.

01:54.032 --> 01:55.432
There's something
we have to talk about.

01:55.433 --> 01:56.867
This can't be about my drinking.

01:56.868 --> 01:59.803
I don't have the money
to be a real alcoholic.

01:59.804 --> 02:01.772
Can you sit in that chair, please?

02:01.773 --> 02:03.173
I never sit in that chair.

02:03.174 --> 02:05.008
Well, today we're doing things differently...

02:05.009 --> 02:06.910
breaking our pattern.
- Hold up.

02:06.911 --> 02:09.413
Did you join scientology?

02:09.413 --> 02:11.315
And I went to Starbucks

02:11.316 --> 02:13.250
and got you a coffee
and a vanilla bear claw.

02:13.251 --> 02:15.619
A Bear Claw? Awesome!
I'll sit anywhere you want.

02:17.655 --> 02:19.456
My life is not where I want it to be.

02:19.457 --> 02:22.192
That $1.47 tip
was a wake-up call

02:22.193 --> 02:24.928
reminding me that life
will always undervalue you

02:24.929 --> 02:26.229
if you let it.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.664
Yes, I've been knocked down,

02:27.665 --> 02:30.500
but now it's time to fight back
and grab life by the balls.

02:30.501 --> 02:34.271
I don't know if life likes
having its balls grabbed.

02:34.272 --> 02:36.673
Some guys do, but those
are usually the ones

02:36.674 --> 02:39.109
who want you to spoon them.

02:39.110 --> 02:41.645
I'd like to explain
my vision for our future

02:41.646 --> 02:44.114
by walking you through...

02:44.115 --> 02:45.682
My vision board.

02:45.683 --> 02:48.051
- Oh, no.
- It's a simple tool.

02:48.052 --> 02:49.953
You're a simple tool.

02:49.954 --> 02:52.089
You start with a thin, white board...

02:52.090 --> 02:55.092
Your thin, white, and I'm bored.

02:55.093 --> 02:57.294
Keep going.
I can do this all day.

02:57.295 --> 02:58.995
I have a Bear Claw in me.

02:58.996 --> 03:00.864
I've been making
vision boards for years,

03:00.865 --> 03:02.666
and I always achieve my goals.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.167
And you think
it's that crazy little board

03:04.168 --> 03:05.969
and not your father's billions?

03:05.970 --> 03:07.270
- Max, it works.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.005
You put up pictures
and inspirational words

03:09.006 --> 03:10.173
of things you want in your life.

03:10.174 --> 03:12.743
See? I have success,
a cupcake business,

03:12.744 --> 03:15.379
and a picture
of a beautiful new bed.

03:15.380 --> 03:17.614
Ah, the ones at the Asylum
look different than that,

03:17.615 --> 03:19.349
so don't get attached.

03:19.350 --> 03:21.651
Sleeping on that couch
is holding me back.

03:21.652 --> 03:23.153
I never get
a restful night's sleep,

03:23.154 --> 03:24.755
and I need a good nine hours.

03:24.756 --> 03:27.791
What you need
is a good nine inches.

03:30.762 --> 03:33.497
That should be
on your vision board.

03:33.498 --> 03:38.101
It is... on the back.

03:38.102 --> 03:39.369
Nice.

03:39.370 --> 03:41.805
Now, unless you're willing
to switch the bedroom

03:41.806 --> 03:42.806
every other week...

03:42.807 --> 03:44.674
No, that sounds mormon.

03:44.675 --> 03:47.677
Then I want to install
a murphy bed in here.

03:47.678 --> 03:49.679
The bed folds up against
the wall during the day,

03:49.680 --> 03:52.015
so you'd still maintain
your signature Williamsburg

03:52.016 --> 03:54.584
"I don't care about anything
chic or nice" decor.

03:54.585 --> 03:56.820
Who's going to build it?
'Cause it's not me.

03:56.821 --> 03:58.321
I'm already
being taken advantage of

03:58.322 --> 03:59.656
at my babysitting job.

03:59.657 --> 04:01.458
Peach has me lugging things
back and forth

04:01.459 --> 04:03.326
to help with the twins'
first birthday party.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.996
I've been sorting through
clown resumes for a week.

04:05.997 --> 04:08.565
Peach is throwing a birthday party?

04:08.566 --> 04:10.434
Did you ask her
if we can cater the desserts?

04:10.435 --> 04:13.170
She hires fancy people
with real companies.

04:13.171 --> 04:14.337
We're not a real business.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.238
See? This is what I'm talking about.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.875
You mock the vision board, but look...

04:18.875 --> 04:20.277
here it is, our cupcake shop.

04:20.278 --> 04:22.412
I don't think we can both
fit in there.

04:22.413 --> 04:24.848
Max, you have to start imagining

04:24.849 --> 04:26.082
what our life can be.

04:26.083 --> 04:29.419
You deserve a cupcake shop,
and I deserve a new bed.

04:29.420 --> 04:31.321
All you have to do is dream it.

04:31.322 --> 04:34.157
No, all you have to do is do it.

04:34.158 --> 04:35.992
And for you to build
a Murphy bed,

04:35.993 --> 04:37.127
it'll take a miracle.

04:37.128 --> 04:40.497
So unless you have Jesus
or <i>Jesus</i>

04:40.498 --> 04:42.666
on that board...

04:42.667 --> 04:44.267
Not going to happen.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.970
Who is it?

04:46.971 --> 04:49.439
It's <i>Jesus...</i>

04:50.761 --> 04:53.830
From Williamsburg hardware.

04:54.947 --> 04:58.716
We got your do-it-yourself
Murphy bed.

04:58.739 --> 05:00.507
See how I made that happen?

05:00.508 --> 05:01.608
Vision.

05:01.609 --> 05:04.911
So which one of them
has the nine inches?

05:08.583 --> 05:10.484
Guess what I did today?

05:10.570 --> 05:13.038
<i>Jesus?</i>

05:13.099 --> 05:14.233
What do you think?

05:14.234 --> 05:16.301
I think the bed still isn't built.

05:16.302 --> 05:17.636
No, but it's almost finished.

05:17.637 --> 05:19.038
Look...

05:19.039 --> 05:20.673
Notice anything different
about me?

05:20.674 --> 05:22.441
I have answer.

05:22.442 --> 05:23.842
You had boob job.

05:23.843 --> 05:26.278
Your "b"s
have turned into "c"s,

05:26.279 --> 05:28.647
and for that,
I give you an "a."

05:28.648 --> 05:31.650
No, I had my uniform altered.

05:31.651 --> 05:33.819
Yes, life dealt me a bad uniform,

05:33.820 --> 05:35.054
but with a little vision,

05:35.055 --> 05:37.423
I can shape it
the way it works best for me.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.191
That should be a tip
in your inspirational book,

05:39.192 --> 05:40.192
which I'm guessing is called

05:40.193 --> 05:41.960
<i>cutting pictures</i>
<i>out of magazines</i>

05:41.961 --> 05:44.430
<i>isn't just</i>
<i>for serial killers anymore.</i>

05:44.431 --> 05:46.498
And this is exciting... look.

05:46.499 --> 05:48.400
The other really important thing
I did today...

05:48.401 --> 05:49.535
made us business cards.

05:49.536 --> 05:50.569
Now you can give one to Peach

05:50.570 --> 05:51.970
and throw our hat
into the party ring.

05:51.971 --> 05:54.073
You're her babysitter.
You already have a connection.

05:54.074 --> 05:57.843
Yeah, a connection
to her babies' asses.

05:57.844 --> 05:59.712
See? That's your limited vision.

05:59.713 --> 06:01.447
Plus, Peach is interviewing
this gay guy

06:01.448 --> 06:02.781
who used to work
for Martha Stewart.

06:02.782 --> 06:05.451
I mean, gay, Martha Stewart...
we can't top that.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.287
Just give her the cards.
We have to start somewhere.

06:08.288 --> 06:10.122
See?
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

06:10.123 --> 06:13.258
And look...
"Max Black, owner/baker."

06:13.259 --> 06:15.360
"Owner/baker"?

06:15.361 --> 06:17.229
That's pretty cool.

06:17.230 --> 06:18.497
See? There it is.

06:18.498 --> 06:19.598
It's real.

06:19.599 --> 06:20.933
But the name sucks a big one.

06:20.934 --> 06:22.968
"Homemade"...
it sounds like homeschooled,

06:22.969 --> 06:24.369
like we're churning out
cupcakes

06:24.370 --> 06:27.740
that aren't comfortable
around other people.

06:28.775 --> 06:30.843
Or it sounds delicious.

06:30.844 --> 06:33.245
And the cupcake on the card
has a cherry on it.

06:33.246 --> 06:35.080
My cupcakes
don't have a cherry...

06:35.081 --> 06:37.816
haven't since I was 13.

06:46.926 --> 06:49.828
If you could really get
under his shoulder blades...

06:49.829 --> 06:53.265
that's where he carries
all his stress.

06:53.266 --> 06:55.267
Don't say your real thoughts.

06:55.268 --> 06:56.635
Don't say your real thoughts.

06:56.636 --> 07:00.739
Max, we're using our spa voice today.

07:00.740 --> 07:02.641
Use my spa voice?
Okay.

07:02.642 --> 07:05.043
I can't afford this.

07:05.044 --> 07:07.513
I want you to make sure

07:07.514 --> 07:09.348
the twins drink lots of water after,

07:09.349 --> 07:11.183
you know, to flush out
the toxins.

07:11.184 --> 07:12.351
Toxins?

07:12.352 --> 07:13.719
All they drink is breast milk.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.621
I can't be sure
what the woman I buy that from

07:15.622 --> 07:16.989
puts in her body.

07:16.990 --> 07:20.492
We're all so tense
about the birthday party.

07:20.493 --> 07:21.960
If everything isn't perfect,

07:21.961 --> 07:24.229
how will they live
with the shame?

07:25.231 --> 07:27.833
Um, Peach, um...

07:27.834 --> 07:29.835
Speaking of the... the party,

07:29.836 --> 07:33.939
uh, I-I started this,
um, thing,

07:33.940 --> 07:35.574
and it's probably dumb, but...

07:35.575 --> 07:36.842
I don't need it.
Like, I'm fine.

07:36.843 --> 07:38.277
I don't need it.
It's just more like...

07:38.278 --> 07:40.112
like a... like a...
Favor.

07:40.113 --> 07:42.681
Um, but, uh, the thing is,
there's the cards,

07:42.682 --> 07:44.283
so I was thinking may...
"maybly"...

07:44.284 --> 07:46.652
"maybly"? What's that?
It's not a word, right?

07:46.653 --> 07:48.987
- I was not saying a word.
- I'm sorry.

07:48.988 --> 07:52.324
I'm done with whatever this is
that you're doing.

07:52.325 --> 07:54.226
I have to go meet
the Martha Stewart queen

07:54.227 --> 07:55.394
and hear his party pitch.

07:55.395 --> 07:56.461
Just remember,

07:56.462 --> 07:59.231
at 3:00, the twins
have their spray tans.

08:02.235 --> 08:06.038
Well, that's exactly
how I envisioned that.

08:09.627 --> 08:11.628
Let me see
what you're drawing, Johnny.

08:11.629 --> 08:13.163
A rat with a civil war hat.

08:13.164 --> 08:16.467
Is that your comment on how
politicians view soldiers?

08:16.527 --> 08:19.829
No, it's an actual rat
I saw wearing a hat.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.832
See, when you tend bar
till 4:00 a.m.,

08:22.833 --> 08:24.567
you see a lot of weird stuff.

08:24.568 --> 08:26.135
And when you waitress
till 2:00,

08:26.136 --> 08:28.972
you see a loser
drawing a rat on a napkin.

08:29.974 --> 08:31.007
Now sign it, please.

08:31.008 --> 08:32.207
Hmm.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.096
You realize my art won't be
worth anything till I'm dead?

08:34.345 --> 08:36.044
Why do you think
I keep inviting you here to eat

08:36.046 --> 08:37.347
week after week?

08:42.107 --> 08:42.974
Question...

08:42.984 --> 08:44.819
how does it feel
to be the owner

08:44.820 --> 08:46.420
of an original piece
of napkin art

08:46.421 --> 08:47.855
worth roughly...

08:47.856 --> 08:49.957
Less than the worth
of the napkin?

08:59.534 --> 09:00.935
Well, I got to get
back to work.

09:00.936 --> 09:02.169
All right, bye.

09:03.772 --> 09:06.941
Pick up... table ten.

09:06.942 --> 09:08.275
I watch you over there.

09:08.276 --> 09:12.146
Much sexual tension
with deadbeat bartender.

09:12.147 --> 09:14.882
He's not just a bartender.
He's a street artist.

09:14.883 --> 09:17.585
And all I did was bite
a piece of celery.

09:17.586 --> 09:21.188
When I think of all the times
I asked you to bite my celery...

09:22.457 --> 09:25.092
And nothing.

09:27.395 --> 09:30.164
Okay, my side work's done,
and my tables are all caught up.

09:30.165 --> 09:31.966
So, tell me,
did you give Peach the card?

09:31.967 --> 09:32.867
No, I didn't.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.074
- Why?
- It was like

09:34.123 --> 09:35.657
my mouth wouldn't
let me do it.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.758
That's crazy.

09:36.759 --> 09:38.226
What's so hard
about going up to Peach

09:38.227 --> 09:39.627
and saying,
"good afternoon, Peach."

09:39.628 --> 09:41.529
"Exciting news...
I started a cupcake business."

09:41.530 --> 09:42.697
"Here's our card."

09:42.698 --> 09:44.065
"Please pass them out
to all your friends,

09:44.066 --> 09:45.333
and help us launch our exciting
new business venture."

09:45.334 --> 09:46.367
"Thank you."

09:46.368 --> 09:47.702
That sounds needy,

09:47.703 --> 09:51.072
like when someone asks you
to come to their one-woman show.

09:51.073 --> 09:52.307
"Somebody date-raped me,

09:52.308 --> 09:53.808
and I didn't think
I'd live through it,

09:53.809 --> 09:55.443
but I did,
and now I'm stronger,

09:55.444 --> 09:57.845
and, uh, still needy."

09:57.846 --> 10:00.415
There is nothing needy
about having a quality product

10:00.416 --> 10:01.749
and wanting it out there.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.685
Look at Earl... he has a CD on display.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.119
Yeah, but he's cool about it.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.888
He doesn't get all
late-night infomercial

10:06.889 --> 10:08.723
and shove them
down people's throats.

10:08.724 --> 10:10.458
Earl?

10:10.459 --> 10:13.094
How many CDs have you sold
at the diner?

10:13.095 --> 10:16.898
Well, in this current economy...

10:16.899 --> 10:19.534
It's been pretty light.

10:19.535 --> 10:22.003
- May I?
- Mm-hmm.

10:22.004 --> 10:24.272
Hi.

10:24.273 --> 10:26.574
You guys
look like music lovers.

10:26.575 --> 10:29.944
This is the best saxophone CD
you will ever hear...

10:29.945 --> 10:31.846
recorded by our cashier Earl Samson.

10:31.847 --> 10:32.981
He's played
with all the greats...

10:32.982 --> 10:35.016
Coltrane, Hancock,
even Bacharach.

10:35.017 --> 10:37.518
His music career derailed
due to a heroin addiction,

10:37.519 --> 10:39.620
but now he's clean and sober

10:39.621 --> 10:44.158
and, at 83,
still following his dream.

10:44.159 --> 10:46.894
Only $9.95 a copy.
Who'd like one?

10:46.895 --> 10:49.897
Thank you!

10:49.898 --> 10:51.699
Earl, four CDs.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.135
Is any of that true?

10:54.136 --> 10:58.573
Nope. She even made up
my damn last name.

10:58.574 --> 11:04.545
That girl can sell.

11:04.546 --> 11:05.947
Oh! Max...

11:05.948 --> 11:07.815
Will you come
look at Brangelina?

11:07.816 --> 11:10.551
I think the spray-tan lady
went a little too far.

11:10.552 --> 11:15.289
I wanted them to look tan,
not foreign.

11:15.290 --> 11:17.058
A little lebanese,

11:17.059 --> 11:19.560
but that'll clear up
in a day or two.

11:19.561 --> 11:21.596
I'm having the worst day.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.999
Jessica Seinfeld stole
the Martha Stewart boy.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.734
I am so upset with her.

11:26.735 --> 11:28.669
I thought we were pretending
to be friends.

11:28.670 --> 11:31.372
And now I have no one
to do the desserts.

11:37.312 --> 11:39.113
- Hello, Peach, exciting news...

11:39.114 --> 11:41.416
I have a cupcake business.
They're really good.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.184
Give these to your friends
and help launch

11:43.185 --> 11:44.352
a new business
or whatever.

11:44.353 --> 11:46.554
That's it. I did it.
Boom!

11:49.825 --> 11:51.359
Okay, the bed still isn't built.

11:51.360 --> 11:54.228
But the mattress came,
and it's so good.

11:54.229 --> 11:56.397
Oh, no... this is not okay.

11:56.398 --> 11:59.067
We're not keeping a mattress
on the floor.

11:59.068 --> 12:02.503
We're poor,
not crackheads.

12:02.504 --> 12:03.871
And you tricked me.

12:03.872 --> 12:06.407
I did my part,
so you better get this bed done.

12:06.408 --> 12:07.909
Max, you gave Peach the cards.

12:07.910 --> 12:10.011
I'm so proud of you.
What did she say?

12:10.012 --> 12:12.447
No. Shut it. Do it.

12:12.448 --> 12:14.182
Relax. The bed will be assembled

12:14.183 --> 12:15.950
and hidden in the wall
by the end of the day,

12:15.951 --> 12:17.118
'cause I decided to do

12:17.119 --> 12:18.853
what cute girls
have been doing for centuries.

12:18.854 --> 12:20.455
I asked a guy for help.

12:20.456 --> 12:22.123
You called a guy?

12:22.124 --> 12:24.392
Oh, is he going to climb up
your long blonde hair

12:24.393 --> 12:27.929
and rescue you
from your murphy-bed tower?

12:27.930 --> 12:29.730
Wait.
You don't know any guys.

12:29.731 --> 12:30.731
Who did you invite?

12:30.732 --> 12:33.434
- Johnny.
- No. No, no, no, no.

12:33.435 --> 12:35.236
Eh, I don't want to see Johnny.

12:35.237 --> 12:37.438
I had a weird thing with him
at the diner last night.

12:37.439 --> 12:39.006
I thought you guys were friends.

12:39.007 --> 12:40.475
I don't know what we are.

12:40.476 --> 12:43.177
He was fake interviewing me
with a celery stalk...

12:43.178 --> 12:45.379
'Cause you're both grown-ups.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.115
And when he put it
near my mouth,

12:47.116 --> 12:48.716
I thought he wanted me
to bite it, so I...

12:48.717 --> 12:50.651
- You bit it?
- I bit it!

12:50.652 --> 12:53.821
- That is weird
and humiliating and hot.

12:53.822 --> 12:55.756
Yes, yes, and, yes.
Call him right now!

12:55.757 --> 12:57.492
He can't come over here.
Look around!

12:57.493 --> 12:59.227
I have his napkins
hanging up everywhere.

12:59.228 --> 13:02.330
He'll think I'm dexter.

13:03.799 --> 13:05.466
Don't answer that.

13:05.467 --> 13:07.902
- Don't you...
- Come on in, Johnny.

13:07.903 --> 13:09.470
Yes, I did it.
I need a bed.

13:09.471 --> 13:10.638
You are so selfish!

13:10.639 --> 13:12.206
Yes, I'm selfish,
and you're Dexter.

13:12.207 --> 13:14.442
So, quick... help me take down the napkins.

13:14.443 --> 13:15.877
Oh, god, there are so many!

13:15.878 --> 13:18.679
How come I never noticed
how many there were before?

13:18.680 --> 13:20.114
I don't know.
Same reason you didn't notice

13:20.115 --> 13:22.316
your father stealing
everybody's money.

13:22.317 --> 13:24.819
Really? Really?
Now when I'm helping you?

13:24.820 --> 13:26.854
You're right.
We'll trash you later.

13:26.855 --> 13:29.557
Why don't you just ask him
what the celery moment meant?

13:29.558 --> 13:31.159
I don't want to ask him.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.727
You don't want to ask
anybody anything.

13:32.728 --> 13:34.162
It's not like the business cards.

13:34.163 --> 13:35.196
What am I going to say?

13:35.197 --> 13:36.230
"Good afternoon, Johnny."

13:36.231 --> 13:37.598
"Exciting news... I have started

13:37.599 --> 13:41.002
an oddly sexual
celery-biting business."

13:42.271 --> 13:44.539
Be right there, Johnny!

13:49.378 --> 13:52.213
Yo.

13:55.517 --> 13:56.784
So I brought tools...
per your request...

13:56.785 --> 13:59.320
and beer, I made
an executive decision on.

14:00.556 --> 14:02.356
So that's what you do
with my art.

14:02.357 --> 14:05.226
Just one, and I put it up there.

14:05.227 --> 14:06.694
She doesn't even like it... she's like,

14:06.695 --> 14:09.630
"why would anyone hang up
stupid napkin art?"

14:09.631 --> 14:11.465
Right off my back.

14:11.466 --> 14:14.235
Had a couple of these
on the subway.

14:14.236 --> 14:16.003
So here's the wood.

14:16.004 --> 14:17.471
You can't help her...

14:17.472 --> 14:19.740
she needs to learn a lesson
about doing things for herself.

14:19.741 --> 14:22.577
She thinks we're her daddy,
and we'll go back on our word,

14:22.578 --> 14:24.312
and she'll get a pony.

14:27.282 --> 14:28.983
Well, you can see
why she'd think that.

14:28.984 --> 14:31.385
I'm going to see
if the horse wants a beer.

14:31.386 --> 14:34.288
Hmm, maybe put my glasses on him...

14:34.289 --> 14:37.592
get crazy up in this piece!

14:37.593 --> 14:40.695
When you're out there,
ask him what the celery meant.

14:40.696 --> 14:43.664
Get busy, princess.
Daddy's got company.

14:45.867 --> 14:49.237
Well, little lady,
I reckon a cowboy'd get used to

14:49.238 --> 14:51.272
a pretty sweet setup like this.

14:51.273 --> 14:53.307
It's a hard life
out on the trails.

14:53.308 --> 14:55.076
Yeah, it's hard
for my people, too,

14:55.077 --> 14:56.444
since you stole all our land

14:56.445 --> 14:59.046
and gave us blankets
covered in smallpox.

14:59.047 --> 15:00.414
I do declare,

15:00.415 --> 15:02.283
I'm sorry
for the disease blankets.

15:02.284 --> 15:04.285
But they did
keep you warm, I bet,

15:04.286 --> 15:06.220
until they killed you, that is.

15:06.221 --> 15:08.289
"I do declare" is not cowboy.

15:08.290 --> 15:09.457
That's Southern Belle.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.559
I think you're looking
for "darn tootin'"

15:11.560 --> 15:12.660
or "dag nab it."

15:12.661 --> 15:14.362
Cowboys did not say "dag nab it."

15:14.363 --> 15:15.596
Yeah, they did.

15:15.597 --> 15:18.899
"Someone done gone stole
my horse, dag nab it."

15:18.900 --> 15:20.735
I think you're thinking "doggone it."

15:20.736 --> 15:22.903
No, "dag nab it"... cowboy.

15:22.904 --> 15:24.805
Do you really think you know
cowboy better than me?

15:24.806 --> 15:26.107
Which one of us has a horse?

15:26.108 --> 15:28.209
Which one of us has assless chaps?

15:31.413 --> 15:33.314
Should I go inside
and help Caroline?

15:33.315 --> 15:36.217
No. I'm sure she's doing just fine.

15:38.887 --> 15:40.354
Can I ask you something?

15:40.355 --> 15:41.722
Sure.

15:41.723 --> 15:45.192
When you put the sss...

15:45.193 --> 15:47.695
we should get on the horse!

15:47.696 --> 15:49.764
- Okay.
- Yeah!

15:51.700 --> 15:55.136
Use three-inch lag screw

15:55.137 --> 15:58.239
to secure ledger board
to wall studs

15:58.240 --> 16:00.308
"aboot" every 12 inches.

16:00.309 --> 16:02.710
Ooh! Your canadian voice is so dull,

16:02.711 --> 16:04.612
I can't understand
a word you're saying.

16:04.613 --> 16:08.482
There's got to be a video
with a better voice.

16:08.483 --> 16:12.853
"How to build a Murphy bed... Morgan Freeman."

16:15.057 --> 16:18.459
Interesting bit of information about horses...

16:18.460 --> 16:19.794
they hurt your balls.

16:19.795 --> 16:21.762
Yeah, mine hurt, too.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.264
You would think after all these years

16:23.265 --> 16:25.266
of riding a horse,
man would have evolved

16:25.267 --> 16:27.601
to have his balls on top
instead of underneath.

16:27.602 --> 16:29.170
Life would be so much easier.

16:29.171 --> 16:32.006
Well, yeah, but I don't see
a lot of old-timey ladies

16:32.007 --> 16:35.209
wanting to get
with the top balls.

16:38.146 --> 16:41.015
Are you thinking
about the celery?

16:41.016 --> 16:43.351
No, I'm still thinking about my balls.

16:45.220 --> 16:49.090
Now I'm thinking about the celery.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.292
That was weird, right?

16:51.293 --> 16:55.996
Not weird, really... more, um, intense.

16:55.997 --> 16:59.433
Intense good or intense bad?

16:59.434 --> 17:02.203
<i>Intense</i> intense.

17:02.204 --> 17:03.170
Whoo.

17:03.171 --> 17:06.073
Whoa. Oh. Did I just grab your...

17:06.074 --> 17:08.075
yeah, I don't know.
"Maybly."

17:08.076 --> 17:11.045
"Maybly"!
That's not a word, right?

17:11.046 --> 17:12.946
- I should...
- I got to get down.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.013
Me too.

17:14.015 --> 17:17.218
My balls.

17:17.219 --> 17:19.720
So take your makeup brush,

17:19.721 --> 17:22.423
take your mirror,
and you want to comb

17:22.424 --> 17:24.525
your eyebrows upwards.

17:24.526 --> 17:26.327
What are you doing?

17:26.328 --> 17:27.428
Okay, okay.

17:27.429 --> 17:29.663
I thought I typed in "Morgan Freeman."

17:29.664 --> 17:33.901
But I'm so tired,
what came up was "more gay men""

17:35.704 --> 17:37.938
but this damon guy is a genius.

17:37.939 --> 17:40.007
If he had a video
on how to build a Murphy bed,

17:40.008 --> 17:41.942
it'd already be done.

17:41.943 --> 17:43.377
Wait. Where's Johnny?

17:43.378 --> 17:45.146
What happened?
Did you ask him?

17:45.147 --> 17:46.480
No, he left.

17:46.481 --> 17:47.715
Out the back?

17:47.716 --> 17:50.117
Yeah, it got even weirder.

17:50.118 --> 17:51.585
He grabbed my boob.

17:51.586 --> 17:53.354
Or... he didn't grab my...

17:53.355 --> 17:54.555
he grabbed my boob.

17:54.556 --> 17:55.890
I just don't know
whether it was on purpose.

17:55.891 --> 17:57.525
But I asked,
like you told me to,

17:57.526 --> 17:59.026
and now I have
a weird boob moment

17:59.027 --> 18:01.128
to go with my weird
celery moment.

18:02.130 --> 18:04.432
That is very complicated.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.467
But I'm great
with relationship stuff.

18:06.468 --> 18:08.702
So come on over here,
and we'll hammer it all out

18:08.703 --> 18:10.971
while we hammer this all out.

18:11.773 --> 18:13.207
Come on, this is
where you break down

18:13.208 --> 18:15.209
and finally help me
build the bed.

18:15.210 --> 18:17.945
No, this is where I go
to my already-built bed.

18:17.946 --> 18:20.047
And after Peaches today and...

18:20.048 --> 18:22.450
Whatever that was out there
with my boob,

18:22.451 --> 18:24.785
I'm not showing anyone
my cards anymore...

18:24.786 --> 18:26.253
business or personal.

18:31.493 --> 18:34.261
Go in!

18:34.262 --> 18:36.497
Go in! Oh!

18:43.451 --> 18:45.053
What is happening out here?

18:45.101 --> 18:47.168
That's the kind of pounding
that's supposed to happen

18:47.169 --> 18:49.704
after you're in the bed.

18:49.705 --> 18:51.840
I can't do it.

18:51.841 --> 18:54.976
I tried.
I really did, but I can't.

18:54.977 --> 18:58.013
I guess I can't do anything
without my father's money.

18:58.014 --> 18:59.147
You were right.

18:59.148 --> 19:00.749
Trying is embarrassing.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.317
So I'm not going to try
anymore.

19:02.318 --> 19:03.585
I'm sick of it.

19:03.586 --> 19:06.454
I'm going to sleep on that horrible couch

19:06.455 --> 19:08.323
and get bad tips
and cry

19:08.324 --> 19:11.526
every waitress day
for the rest of my life.

19:12.728 --> 19:15.463
Daddy, please.

19:15.464 --> 19:17.299
God, you're a baby.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.868
Okay, I'll help you...
this one time only.

19:19.869 --> 19:21.503
And we're not going
to bond when we do it.

19:21.504 --> 19:23.071
We're not going to high-five
when we finish.

19:23.072 --> 19:24.472
And I don't want to hear
two months from now,

19:24.473 --> 19:26.007
"hey, remember that night
we built the Murphy bed?

19:26.008 --> 19:27.809
That was awesome."
None of that. Got it?

19:28.844 --> 19:29.911
We need the power drill,

19:29.912 --> 19:32.013
1/4-inch bit,
some masonry screws,

19:32.014 --> 19:33.848
and a Bear Claw.

19:33.849 --> 19:36.084
Now delete "eyebrows,"

19:36.085 --> 19:38.353
type in "Murphy bed,"
and let's build this mother.

19:42.368 --> 19:44.035
I can't believe we did it.

19:44.036 --> 19:46.071
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

19:47.524 --> 19:48.492
Oh, Max.

19:48.515 --> 19:51.984
You put the bakery up
on your vision beam.

19:51.985 --> 19:54.920
Say anything more,
and I'll take it down.

19:56.523 --> 19:58.991
Do you know this number?

19:58.992 --> 20:00.192
That's Peach.

20:00.193 --> 20:01.560
- Why would she call you?
- It's about

20:01.561 --> 20:03.629
the cupcake business...
my number's on the card.

20:05.565 --> 20:07.132
Put it on speaker.

20:07.133 --> 20:08.367
Hello?

20:08.368 --> 20:10.169
I found your card
in my baby's room.

20:10.170 --> 20:13.072
I have no idea who you are
or how it got there,

20:13.073 --> 20:15.040
but I'm throwing
a birthday party in a week,

20:15.041 --> 20:16.575
and I thought cupcakes
might be fun.

20:16.576 --> 20:17.977
Oh, they are.

20:17.978 --> 20:19.345
People love cupcakes.

20:19.346 --> 20:21.213
They bring a sense
of whimsy and nostalgia.

20:21.214 --> 20:22.314
That's enough.

20:22.315 --> 20:23.949
Why don't you tell me

20:23.950 --> 20:25.751
some of the other events
you've done?

20:25.752 --> 20:28.254
Oh, well,
we're a start-up company.

20:28.255 --> 20:30.656
Oh, no,
I need a real business.

20:30.657 --> 20:32.358
Bye-bye.

20:32.359 --> 20:35.928
Well, there you go...
complete waste of our time.

20:35.929 --> 20:37.963
See?
Trying is embarrassing.

20:37.964 --> 20:41.433
No. That was great, incredible.

20:41.434 --> 20:43.836
What? She hung up on you.

20:43.837 --> 20:45.704
Yes. But it proves one thing.

20:45.705 --> 20:47.339
The cards... they worked!

20:47.340 --> 20:48.908
This is so inspiring.

20:48.909 --> 20:51.777
First we build a Murphy bed,
next a cupcake business,

20:51.778 --> 20:52.912
then, Max...

20:52.913 --> 20:54.980
Who knows what else?

21:00.186 --> 21:02.021
Uh, adjust the springs?

21:02.022 --> 21:04.723
No, that's perfect.
