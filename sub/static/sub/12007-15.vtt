Previously on Switched at Birth...

00:03.375 --> 00:06.293
What happened to "I'll
always come find you"?

00:06.328 --> 00:08.495
What happened to every single thing

00:08.530 --> 00:10.264
that you have ever said to me?

00:18.173 --> 00:20.007
This is my boyfriend, Emmett.

00:21.994 --> 00:25.212
If they're together, just tell me.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

00:37.193 --> 00:39.443
Guess who else is gonna go

00:39.495 --> 00:41.545
- to Mexico with Melody?
- What?

00:41.597 --> 00:44.448
She said I could take
one day to do my interview

00:44.483 --> 00:46.366
for the Frida Kahlo program.

00:46.402 --> 00:48.302
So happy you're coming!

00:50.242 --> 00:52.426
"I love you more than your own skin.

00:52.461 --> 00:55.229
And even though you don't
love me the same way...

00:55.231 --> 00:57.281
"I adore you.

00:57.333 --> 01:01.935
Diego, Diego, I want to be
inside your darkest everything."

01:07.960 --> 01:09.977
That lady was nuts.

01:09.979 --> 01:11.945
Um, excuse me?

01:11.981 --> 01:15.966
Okay, I'm not the expert
on Frida Kahlo that you are,

01:16.018 --> 01:18.752
but I read your book on the plane.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.871
"Diego in my urine,

01:20.906 --> 01:23.557
Diego in my mouth,

01:23.592 --> 01:26.460
in my heart, in my madness,

01:26.495 --> 01:27.628
in my sleep."

01:27.663 --> 01:28.915
It's too much!

01:29.098 --> 01:33.117
She and Diego Rivera
had the most passionate

01:33.169 --> 01:35.936
relationship of our time.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.171
It... it was epic!

01:37.206 --> 01:38.272
It was obsession!

01:38.324 --> 01:41.875
Okay, well, we agree to disagree.

01:41.877 --> 01:44.061
I cannot wait to see her house,

01:44.113 --> 01:47.714
to actually touch the
walls where she worked...

01:47.750 --> 01:49.083
I have seriously been dreaming of this

01:49.118 --> 01:51.068
since I was nine years old.

01:51.103 --> 01:52.986
You're gonna rock that interview.

01:52.988 --> 01:53.987
Thanks.

01:55.958 --> 01:57.758
How's the scorpion lollipop?

02:31.944 --> 02:34.828
Hey! Hola!

02:38.651 --> 02:40.033
- Hey!
- How are you?

02:40.069 --> 02:41.969
- Gracias.
- De nada.

02:42.004 --> 02:44.705
- Thank you, Gabe.
- You're very welcome.

02:44.740 --> 02:45.772
I have missed you.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.514
What about me?

02:57.353 --> 02:59.219
Welcome to Mexico!

02:59.255 --> 03:01.121
I am so excited to do this!

03:02.408 --> 03:04.158
Well, that's weird.

03:05.327 --> 03:07.261
We're not expecting anyone else, right?

03:07.296 --> 03:08.896
I don't think so.

03:08.914 --> 03:10.247
Then I wonder...

03:10.282 --> 03:13.100
who on earth that could be.

03:22.845 --> 03:24.011
You have got to be kidding.

03:39.361 --> 03:40.627
Are you gonna be okay?

03:42.581 --> 03:44.214
Guess I'm gonna have to be.

04:01.183 --> 04:02.266
Hi.

04:04.436 --> 04:05.519
Okay.

04:05.571 --> 04:09.356
We have a few hours
before we start training.

04:09.408 --> 04:12.526
So you can settle in, siesta,

04:12.578 --> 04:15.529
or spend some time
shopping in the market here.

04:18.803 --> 04:20.117
Me, too.

04:23.422 --> 04:28.458
So, Bay and I are gonna go
check out the marketplace.

04:28.510 --> 04:30.460
Yes, we are.

05:17.846 --> 05:18.592
Hmm.

05:24.350 --> 05:25.515
I know.

05:33.559 --> 05:35.409
Thanks.

05:35.444 --> 05:37.327
It is. A little bit.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.281
I'm good.

05:44.019 --> 05:45.285
Thanks.

05:59.134 --> 06:00.550
Oh.

06:00.602 --> 06:02.219
Okay.

06:02.271 --> 06:03.387
That's good to know.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.534
Welcome, volunteers!

06:17.569 --> 06:21.238
Right here, right now, we give out
a million hearing aids each year.

06:21.290 --> 06:23.457
The patient forms give
us important information

06:23.492 --> 06:25.375
like how and when they went deaf,

06:25.411 --> 06:27.160
if they've ever used a hearing aid before,

06:27.212 --> 06:28.512
and if they sign or speak.

06:30.225 --> 06:32.165
And here are the hearing AIDS,

06:32.217 --> 06:34.167
arranged in rows by their levels...

06:34.219 --> 06:37.137
two, three, four, and up to ten.

06:37.172 --> 06:39.172
How many people will we see today?

06:39.224 --> 06:40.390
Around 500.

06:41.643 --> 06:44.227
People have come as far as eight hours away

06:44.263 --> 06:45.512
on buses in order to see us.

06:45.514 --> 06:47.514
They'll wait in line all day for a chance

06:47.516 --> 06:49.182
to get one of these.

06:49.184 --> 06:51.184
That's amazing.

06:51.236 --> 06:53.570
Deaf people in countries
like this are disconnected.

06:53.605 --> 06:56.156
With this little microphone in their ear,

06:56.208 --> 06:57.157
we can change lives.

06:59.228 --> 07:00.260
We will change lives.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.196
All right. Now pick a
station and let's get started.

07:06.068 --> 07:08.719
I see you're a bus driver?

07:08.754 --> 07:10.003
Bus?

07:10.055 --> 07:11.722
Sí.

07:14.743 --> 07:15.942
He was. Not anymore.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.611
¿Cuándo?

07:17.646 --> 07:19.780
Dos años.

07:19.832 --> 07:21.681
Two years.

07:21.717 --> 07:23.650
Pero...

07:24.737 --> 07:25.819
No work.

07:25.854 --> 07:28.588
Sounds like he lost his job
when he lost his hearing.

07:30.392 --> 07:31.558
Let's see what we can do.

07:31.593 --> 07:33.210
Try the twos on him.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.294
Okay.

07:39.201 --> 07:41.067
Can you hear me, Alfredo?

07:46.341 --> 07:48.024
Me llamo Daphne.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.309
Daphne!

07:49.311 --> 07:52.078
- You say Daphne!
- Yeah!

08:04.055 --> 08:05.926
- Muchas gracias.
- De nada, Alfredo.

08:09.701 --> 08:10.464
Gracias.

08:16.385 --> 08:17.454
Gracias. Gracias.

08:18.507 --> 08:19.506
Adiós.

08:22.444 --> 08:24.194
That was so cool!

08:24.246 --> 08:27.180
I can't believe you get
to do this every day!

08:27.216 --> 08:28.982
It's been two and a half
years, and I still wake up

08:28.984 --> 08:31.284
every single morning with a
huge stupid grin on my face.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.302
That's so awesome.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.020
You ready for your next patient?

08:34.022 --> 08:35.155
Definitely.

08:44.049 --> 08:48.935
You told me that Emmett
and Skye weren't dating.

08:48.971 --> 08:50.720
How could you lie to me?

08:50.756 --> 08:52.706
How could you protect him like that?

08:59.481 --> 09:01.198
Oh, so I could instead find out

09:01.250 --> 09:05.235
from him in the middle of
my spring break in Mexico?

09:11.310 --> 09:13.393
I thought I was over this, but...

09:13.395 --> 09:16.229
seeing him for the first
time and then hearing that...

09:16.265 --> 09:20.267
it's like a trolley pole
stabbing me in the stomach.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.888
It happened to Frida when she was 18.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.007
It was a trolley accident.

09:27.042 --> 09:28.742
The pole stabbed her in the gut.

09:28.744 --> 09:30.777
It went in one side and out the other.

09:42.524 --> 09:45.392
How dare he come on
this trip with all of us.

09:45.427 --> 09:46.576
How dare he.

09:50.300 --> 09:50.764
"Oh, hi.

09:50.799 --> 09:54.200
Sorry about the whole I-broke-your-heart-
into-a-million-pieces thing,

09:54.236 --> 09:56.469
but I just had to wait until I was sure

09:56.521 --> 10:00.240
that this other girl, who can help
me with my career, would take me,

10:00.242 --> 10:04.144
and then wait for the worst
possible moment to tell Bay

10:04.179 --> 10:06.246
and then ultimately do what's best for me.

10:06.281 --> 10:08.081
I hope that's cool."

10:20.596 --> 10:23.630
Oh, it's gonna be a
horrible trip, all right.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.468
Hola. Soy Daphne.

10:28.487 --> 10:30.487
Hola. Eufemia y mi hija Pati.

10:30.522 --> 10:31.471
Hi.

10:33.375 --> 10:36.476
Okay, no oral skills, no signing.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.578
¿Habla inglés?

10:38.614 --> 10:40.130
No.

10:42.417 --> 10:43.450
Hey, Quinn?

10:44.569 --> 10:47.153
- Do you have a sec?
- Yeah. What's up?

10:47.189 --> 10:49.255
I've got a mom who doesn't speak English

10:49.291 --> 10:52.809
and a 15-year-old who
can't hear, speak, or sign.

10:52.844 --> 10:54.010
According to this,

10:54.062 --> 10:55.729
she's been deaf since birth.

10:55.731 --> 10:56.796
How does she communicate?

11:00.902 --> 11:02.636
Looks like she just points at things.

11:02.671 --> 11:04.771
Can she read or write?

11:06.642 --> 11:08.491
No.

11:08.543 --> 11:09.676
How does she get by in school?

11:09.711 --> 11:11.344
Is she even in school?

11:16.635 --> 11:19.202
She's 15 and never been to school?

11:19.237 --> 11:20.387
Hey, um...

11:20.422 --> 11:21.588
we're not here to judge anyone, okay?

11:21.623 --> 11:25.108
How can she learn if she
doesn't have a language,

11:25.160 --> 11:27.077
no words to express herself?

11:27.112 --> 11:28.294
Someone needs to teach her how to sign.

11:28.347 --> 11:32.082
Our job is just to see if we
can find a hearing aid for her.

11:32.117 --> 11:34.834
We're not here to lecture
or shame anyone, all right?

11:39.107 --> 11:40.206
Gracias.

11:49.759 --> 11:51.459
We have one more to try.

11:51.494 --> 11:52.660
Uno más.

11:57.567 --> 11:59.300
Baa baa baa.

11:59.335 --> 12:01.085
Baa baa baa baa.

12:08.344 --> 12:10.211
Baa baa baa.

12:10.246 --> 12:12.163
Baa baa baa.

12:25.828 --> 12:26.961
How's it going over here?

12:26.996 --> 12:29.563
I just tried a ten. Nothing.

12:29.565 --> 12:31.732
Okay. I'll take it from here.

12:36.572 --> 12:37.571
Gracias.

12:43.546 --> 12:45.413
Anime stickers?

12:53.122 --> 12:54.188
Hey!

12:58.327 --> 12:59.326
Sure.

13:05.101 --> 13:06.867
That bracelet is so pretty.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.686
Did you make it?

13:11.258 --> 13:13.758
Oh, so she has, like, a matching one?

13:13.810 --> 13:15.876
Oh, that's really cute.

13:19.849 --> 13:24.535
Yeah... so I saw those
anime stickers on your bag.

13:24.570 --> 13:28.322
I thought that you said
that anime was stupid.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.243
Oh, right! Right.

13:32.295 --> 13:33.750
It's me who thinks that it's stupid.

13:33.756 --> 13:36.430
So does she, like, dress up like Lolita?

13:36.466 --> 13:39.250
Like a punk fairy with the weird buns

13:39.302 --> 13:41.435
and freaky eyeliner and
striped knee socks and wigs?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.104
Because all of that just reinforces

13:43.139 --> 13:45.906
the negative stereotype of the
giggly, submissive school girl.

14:01.958 --> 14:04.759
Just give them your paper,
and they'll take care of you.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.595
Thanks. Adiós.

14:07.630 --> 14:08.629
Hey.

15:14.931 --> 15:16.981
What happened? ¿Qué pasa?

15:17.033 --> 15:19.950
No hear. No hear.

16:08.851 --> 16:10.618
I mean, I am here.

16:42.007 --> 16:43.173
So excited.

16:51.123 --> 16:52.616
Please, it's fine.

16:52.668 --> 16:54.718
We are all adults here.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.553
Hey,

16:56.572 --> 16:58.622
don't keep your hot date waiting.

17:10.202 --> 17:11.401
What?

17:14.439 --> 17:15.505
Yes.

17:17.309 --> 17:19.142
So she knows what it feels like

17:19.178 --> 17:22.078
to have some other girl
messing with her relationship

17:22.131 --> 17:23.513
from 2,000 miles away.

17:30.022 --> 17:31.888
Me jealous? Me?

17:31.940 --> 17:34.758
You are the one who was
so jealous of me and Tank

17:34.793 --> 17:37.611
that you made a movie about it,

17:37.646 --> 17:39.095
and then broke up with me,

17:39.131 --> 17:42.532
even after I told you that I didn't
want anything to happen with him.

17:59.418 --> 18:01.151
We did everything that we could.

18:01.186 --> 18:03.253
She is profoundly deaf.

18:03.288 --> 18:05.922
Which wouldn't be a
tragedy if she could sign.

18:05.924 --> 18:06.940
I know.

18:06.975 --> 18:09.025
Most developing countries
are 50 years behind.

18:09.077 --> 18:10.961
They just don't have the resources.

18:11.013 --> 18:13.063
Okay, well her mom could
be teaching her Spanish,

18:13.098 --> 18:15.582
how to read and write...
she's not even trying.

18:15.617 --> 18:17.801
It's a different reality.

18:17.853 --> 18:19.836
Most people are just trying
to do their best to survive.

18:21.473 --> 18:23.473
I should have never let her go.

18:23.508 --> 18:26.409
For those 15 or 20 people you
fit with a hearing aid today,

18:26.411 --> 18:27.744
you changed their lives.

18:29.514 --> 18:31.448
You need to focus on that.

18:31.483 --> 18:33.583
You have a pretty cool job.

18:33.635 --> 18:36.119
I do.

18:36.154 --> 18:38.421
You do meet the patis of the world,

18:38.457 --> 18:40.290
and that hurts.

18:41.894 --> 18:44.294
But every single day, I get
to change somebody's life.

18:46.899 --> 18:48.098
How many people can say that?

18:51.103 --> 18:53.637
I just decided I want
to be you when I grow up.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.608
Hey, wanna dance?

18:58.644 --> 19:00.543
Oh, no, gracias.

19:00.579 --> 19:02.646
Oh, come on. When in Rome...

19:03.799 --> 19:06.399
Oh.

19:06.435 --> 19:07.684
It's my boyfriend.

19:07.686 --> 19:08.718
I'd better answer.

19:08.754 --> 19:10.620
Saved by the cell.

19:10.672 --> 19:12.489
Thanks for the pep talk.

19:12.524 --> 19:14.291
I hope it helped.

19:14.326 --> 19:15.492
It did.

19:15.527 --> 19:17.460
I'll get another round.

19:21.283 --> 19:22.399
Hi!

19:22.434 --> 19:23.967
How's South Padre?

19:29.141 --> 19:30.807
You're so good with them.

19:41.770 --> 19:42.969
What if we change that?

19:43.021 --> 19:44.721
Hmm?

19:44.756 --> 19:46.589
We should adopt a kid together.

19:48.644 --> 19:49.693
A deaf kid.

19:51.463 --> 19:54.597
You would be such an amazing role model

19:54.599 --> 19:55.665
for a little girl.

19:58.170 --> 19:59.502
I want to do this with you.

20:03.091 --> 20:05.342
This may seem sudden to you,

20:05.377 --> 20:08.144
but I have been thinking
about this for months.

20:08.180 --> 20:12.032
And being on the road has
made me sure of one thing.

20:13.285 --> 20:14.951
I want to be a dad.

20:23.862 --> 20:25.528
Will you think about it?

20:36.695 --> 20:37.474
Ready!

20:41.263 --> 20:42.312
Mm.

20:45.250 --> 20:46.383
Oh, wow.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.986
You are turning red!

20:52.958 --> 20:54.824
You've got to see yourself!

20:56.028 --> 20:57.110
Are you okay?

20:58.830 --> 20:59.929
Viva México!

20:59.965 --> 21:01.097
Viva México!

21:03.035 --> 21:05.668
Hey, I have an idea.

21:05.670 --> 21:08.004
Let's do body shots.

21:10.175 --> 21:12.575
Oh, I am sure. It's spring break!

21:12.577 --> 21:13.743
- Let's do it!
- All right.

21:13.795 --> 21:15.678
All right! Cool!

21:26.708 --> 21:28.258
Uh-huh...

21:29.561 --> 21:30.527
Okay.

21:32.531 --> 21:33.546
Mm.

21:36.068 --> 21:36.983
Mm.

21:39.888 --> 21:42.005
Oh, now who's jealous?

21:45.961 --> 21:46.910
Excuse me?

21:49.869 --> 21:51.831
Oh, I will do whatever I want

21:51.867 --> 21:53.967
with whoever I want. Just like you.

21:55.609 --> 21:56.903
Don't talk to him like that.

22:05.630 --> 22:08.565
If I'm sleeping with him,
it is none of your business.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.272
Oh, do not point at me like that!

22:24.466 --> 22:25.281
Whoa! Emmett!

22:25.333 --> 22:27.267
Are you kidding me? Stop!

22:29.020 --> 22:29.986
Wha...

22:32.157 --> 22:33.089
- Stop!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

22:33.141 --> 22:34.974
Stop! Stop! Break it up.

22:35.026 --> 22:36.025
Break it up.

23:10.064 --> 23:12.960
Hi. I'm Daphne.

23:13.300 --> 23:14.249
And this is Travis.

23:16.136 --> 23:18.103
"Hi. I'm Ramón."

23:18.138 --> 23:21.956
So you went deaf from malaria?

23:25.779 --> 23:26.845
"Yeah, when I was a boy."

23:26.880 --> 23:29.714
I got meningitis at three.

23:32.652 --> 23:34.452
I see you already have hearing aids.

23:37.441 --> 23:39.657
"Yeah, but I got it a long time ago.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.326
Need a stronger one."

23:41.361 --> 23:43.395
Okay. What level are those?

23:43.430 --> 23:44.362
"Four."

23:48.468 --> 23:51.169
I'm trying to pick up
Mexican sign language,

23:51.204 --> 23:53.188
but it's so different from ASL.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.074
"It is."

23:56.109 --> 23:59.144
I don't meet a lot of people who sign here.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.112
Where did you learn?

24:02.999 --> 24:04.849
"In Mexico City.

24:04.885 --> 24:08.870
It has one of the country's six
elementary schools for the deaf."

24:08.905 --> 24:10.922
Six in the entire country?

24:15.028 --> 24:16.027
"I feel so lucky."

24:20.934 --> 24:22.834
If I asked you a favor,

24:22.869 --> 24:24.536
would you think about it?

24:27.441 --> 24:29.441
He's agreed to teach
Mexican sign language to Pati

24:29.476 --> 24:30.642
and anyone else who wants to learn.

24:30.694 --> 24:31.743
- Like a class?
- Yeah.

24:31.778 --> 24:34.245
They'll meet in the town
square by the fountain.

24:34.247 --> 24:35.296
All he needs are a few chairs,

24:35.332 --> 24:37.599
and he's willing to come in twice a week.

24:37.651 --> 24:39.350
That's amazing!

24:39.352 --> 24:42.203
Now I just have to convince Pati's mom.

24:42.255 --> 24:43.288
Can you give me her patient form

24:43.323 --> 24:44.389
with her home address?

24:44.391 --> 24:46.474
You're gonna wander off into
rural Mexico by yourself?

24:46.526 --> 24:47.992
I'll be fine.

24:47.994 --> 24:50.195
You don't know the language, and
you don't know where you're going.

24:50.230 --> 24:51.179
I'll figure it out.

24:51.214 --> 24:53.364
I found someone to teach her sign language.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.233
Don't you get what this could mean for her?

24:55.345 --> 24:57.295
I do, but I think you're being naive

24:57.330 --> 24:58.913
and frankly, kind of stupid.

24:58.949 --> 25:00.899
- Thank you.
- You are.

25:00.934 --> 25:04.068
I remember she lives
in a town called Sabino.

25:04.104 --> 25:05.970
- I'll take it from there.
- Daphne...

25:06.006 --> 25:08.740
look, I know that I sound idealistic,

25:08.775 --> 25:10.675
but if I had been born in Mexico,

25:10.710 --> 25:11.659
I could've been that girl.

25:11.695 --> 25:14.829
If I can help her, I have to try.

25:29.629 --> 25:32.197
Okay.

25:32.232 --> 25:34.249
No. No, no, no...

25:34.301 --> 25:36.334
It can't be closed!

25:36.386 --> 25:37.435
Ugh!

25:37.470 --> 25:39.370
- ¿Estás bien?
- No.

25:39.406 --> 25:41.239
No estoy bien.

25:41.241 --> 25:42.974
I was gonna...

25:44.261 --> 25:48.997
Iba... Take un taxi, pero everyone said,

25:49.049 --> 25:50.882
"no, no, no, no. No toma taxi

25:50.917 --> 25:54.736
porque dangerous para una... girl."

25:54.788 --> 25:57.121
So tomé el Metro.

25:57.123 --> 26:00.892
But the Metro has, like,
the most confusing names

26:00.927 --> 26:02.076
in the world.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.995
So I got on the Azul instead of the Verde,

26:04.047 --> 26:08.449
and now I've missed the most
important interview of my entire life.

26:08.501 --> 26:10.568
Siéntate.

26:16.843 --> 26:20.478
I came all the way here
to interview in person.

26:20.513 --> 26:24.415
See her house, to feel her...

26:31.024 --> 26:33.057
I know she's a lot of people's idol.

26:34.294 --> 26:36.261
I like your jacket.

26:36.296 --> 26:38.813
Oh! Oh, thank you.

26:38.848 --> 26:40.815
I made it.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.967
She would have loved it.

26:43.003 --> 26:44.669
Who?

26:44.704 --> 26:46.638
Uh... ¿quién?

26:46.656 --> 26:47.739
Frida.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.876
Did you, like, know her?

26:51.911 --> 26:54.746
Sí, muy bien.

26:58.652 --> 27:00.702
She was your teacher?

27:00.754 --> 27:02.587
Oh, my god.

27:02.589 --> 27:06.557
You have to tell me everything.

27:06.593 --> 27:08.359
¿Todo?

27:08.395 --> 27:12.397
I need a ride to Sabino?

27:12.399 --> 27:14.449
Ah, Sabino!

27:21.958 --> 27:24.008
He said it's 45 kilometers north.

27:34.788 --> 27:35.820
We can ride in back.

27:35.855 --> 27:36.921
We?

27:36.956 --> 27:38.589
Well, I said you couldn't go alone.

27:39.726 --> 27:40.692
Come on.

28:02.025 --> 28:04.358
Maybe we could catch another ride.

28:04.410 --> 28:06.377
I don't think this road gets much traffic.

28:06.429 --> 28:08.930
How far to Sabino?

28:16.873 --> 28:18.673
I've got good walking shoes on.

28:21.844 --> 28:23.027
- Adiós, señor.
- Adiós.

28:23.062 --> 28:24.779
Hey! Limones.

28:24.814 --> 28:26.664
Gracias.

28:26.716 --> 28:27.798
- Thank you.
- Adiós.

28:27.834 --> 28:29.850
We need to go northwest, so...

28:29.852 --> 28:32.436
Stay this side of the sun.

28:32.488 --> 28:33.654
Girl scouts?

28:33.690 --> 28:35.456
- Astronomy 101.
- Oh.

28:35.458 --> 28:38.309
A girl after my own nerdy heart.

28:40.313 --> 28:43.180
So 1950... that was 65 years ago.

28:43.216 --> 28:47.201
- You must have been...
- Close to your age.

28:47.236 --> 28:50.137
Wow. I am so jealous.

28:50.173 --> 28:52.340
There were monkeys all around here...

28:52.375 --> 28:56.143
parrots... plants growing like a jungle.

28:56.179 --> 28:58.012
Era mágica.

28:58.047 --> 29:00.214
What else? What else? What was she like?

29:00.249 --> 29:01.148
Colorful.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.250
She drank Tequila and sang dirty songs

29:03.286 --> 29:04.802
that liked to shock people.

29:04.854 --> 29:07.955
Tiny but with a big presence.

29:10.026 --> 29:12.059
Why do you love her so much?

29:12.095 --> 29:15.763
Oh, where do I begin?

29:15.798 --> 29:19.533
Well, when I was little, I
always felt like I was different.

29:19.569 --> 29:20.901
I never fit in.

29:20.953 --> 29:21.902
I know why now,

29:21.904 --> 29:24.505
but I didn't then.

29:24.540 --> 29:27.441
And I discovered her, and
I read something she said

29:27.493 --> 29:30.294
about she always felt
like a strange child, too.

29:30.346 --> 29:31.512
And then there's her art.

29:31.547 --> 29:36.367
It's so... personal and female and intense.

29:36.419 --> 29:38.486
You look like her.

29:38.521 --> 29:40.171
Oh, my god.

29:40.223 --> 29:41.405
Thank you so much.

29:41.441 --> 29:45.342
Actually, sometimes I feel like I have

29:45.378 --> 29:47.028
a little of her inside of me.

29:48.197 --> 29:49.196
I hope not.

29:50.917 --> 29:54.135
She had exhibitions across the world.

29:54.203 --> 29:57.088
Her paintings go for millions of dollars.

29:57.123 --> 29:59.040
Of course I want to be her.

29:59.092 --> 30:02.743
She was probably one of the
most talented women in history.

30:02.779 --> 30:03.878
She was.

30:03.913 --> 30:06.714
And also one of the unhappiest.

30:08.034 --> 30:09.850
Well, she had all that pain

30:09.886 --> 30:11.919
because of the bus
accident when she was 18.

30:11.938 --> 30:13.554
Claro.

30:13.556 --> 30:15.823
But it was Diego that
caused her the most pain.

30:15.875 --> 30:19.727
Well, I know they had a
tumultuous relationship,

30:19.762 --> 30:22.363
but they adored each other.

30:22.365 --> 30:24.231
Frida, Diego. Frida, Diego.

30:24.267 --> 30:25.466
Their names are always said together.

30:25.518 --> 30:28.402
They... were meant to be.

30:28.438 --> 30:31.172
They broke up and they
got back together again,

30:31.207 --> 30:33.424
and then they broke up and
got back together again.

30:33.476 --> 30:36.110
They tortured each other by having affairs

30:36.145 --> 30:37.878
with people close to them.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.881
He slept with her sister.

30:40.917 --> 30:43.184
She slept with his friends.

30:43.219 --> 30:45.820
But the way she wrote about him...

30:45.855 --> 30:49.123
the paintings she made of him...

30:50.927 --> 30:52.927
to have a love like that...

30:52.962 --> 30:54.962
Not if you saw it.

30:54.997 --> 30:57.865
The jealousy, the obsession...

30:59.702 --> 31:00.901
It destroyed her.

31:15.618 --> 31:17.168
Man.

31:17.220 --> 31:19.053
Yeah.

31:26.279 --> 31:27.795
Hola, Pati.

31:41.744 --> 31:42.776
We don't have any money.

31:42.812 --> 31:44.578
It won't cost you anything.

31:44.580 --> 31:47.565
Ramón will teach her for free.

31:47.600 --> 31:51.385
San Marcos is one hour
away. How will she get there?

31:51.420 --> 31:53.420
Can she take the bus?

31:55.324 --> 31:56.490
No. I don't want her to go alone.

31:56.526 --> 31:58.259
Maybe you could go with her.

31:58.294 --> 31:59.426
Ramón could teach you to sign, too.

32:05.268 --> 32:07.234
I have to work.

32:07.286 --> 32:09.036
Of course.

32:09.071 --> 32:10.421
But if you can find the time,

32:10.473 --> 32:14.942
it's so important that your
daughter have a way to communicate.

32:25.821 --> 32:26.954
It's no use. She can't learn.

32:26.989 --> 32:28.906
How do you know that?

32:28.958 --> 32:30.624
Have you tried teaching her?

32:36.649 --> 32:37.731
We came to you for help

32:37.767 --> 32:39.450
and all you did was get our hopes up.

32:42.638 --> 32:45.105
If I can teach her one word,

32:45.141 --> 32:46.373
will you agree to take her?

32:54.217 --> 32:56.100
- You won't.
- But if I can...

32:56.135 --> 32:58.018
Do you promise?

33:09.849 --> 33:10.881
Dog.

33:12.818 --> 33:13.968
Dog.

33:14.003 --> 33:15.869
He's a dog.

33:15.905 --> 33:17.671
Dog.

33:17.707 --> 33:19.840
He is a dog.

34:58.824 --> 35:00.607
Hey, you tried.

35:00.659 --> 35:02.009
Sorry I dragged you along.

35:02.044 --> 35:03.677
I'm not.

35:21.731 --> 35:23.330
Dog. Yes!

35:23.366 --> 35:24.565
Yes!

35:24.567 --> 35:27.167
Dog! Yeah. Yes!

35:28.471 --> 35:30.437
Yes! Yes!

35:31.574 --> 35:32.539
She gets it.

35:35.344 --> 35:36.343
She gets it!

35:46.571 --> 35:48.604
Did you see the way her eyes lit up?

35:48.639 --> 35:49.838
It was like something just clicked.

35:49.874 --> 35:51.507
It was amazing!

35:51.542 --> 35:52.675
You are amazing.

35:52.710 --> 35:54.443
I couldn't have done it without you.

35:54.445 --> 35:55.578
So, thank you.

36:04.222 --> 36:05.387
Sorry.

36:05.423 --> 36:06.605
You have boyfriend.

36:08.626 --> 36:10.125
Yeah.

36:10.177 --> 36:11.260
My bad.

36:18.169 --> 36:20.069
So, what's his name?

36:20.104 --> 36:21.237
This lucky guy.

36:23.207 --> 36:24.773
Mingo.

36:36.570 --> 36:37.853
I'm so embarrassed.

36:40.691 --> 36:43.592
I lost my mind here.

36:43.628 --> 36:47.396
It's like something happened
the minute I saw you.

36:55.539 --> 37:00.376
You have every right to date Skye.

37:01.529 --> 37:04.346
One of us has to be first, right?

37:31.125 --> 37:34.743
Let's not do that for
the rest of our lives.

37:36.814 --> 37:40.015
Let's not torture each other.

38:00.438 --> 38:01.520
Take care.

38:04.642 --> 38:06.492
Have you guys seen Melody?

38:06.544 --> 38:08.577
No... or Daphne.

38:12.583 --> 38:15.117
Well, I'm sure that they're coming.

38:25.963 --> 38:27.029
Is everything okay?

38:38.242 --> 38:39.842
What?

38:47.968 --> 38:49.752
I love you, too!

38:56.827 --> 38:57.993
I'm so excited!

39:12.710 --> 39:13.876
Got it.

39:19.733 --> 39:21.817
Okay, seriously, where is Daphne?

39:31.297 --> 39:32.463
Her mom said she'd bring her.

39:32.515 --> 39:35.549
There could be a thousand
reasons why they didn't come,

39:35.601 --> 39:36.633
but these people did.

39:38.237 --> 39:39.570
Your passion to help one person

39:39.572 --> 39:41.205
helped five more.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.173
Doesn't that count?

39:43.209 --> 39:46.427
Well, of course. But
what's gonna happen to Pati?

39:46.479 --> 39:50.247
She learned her first word thanks to you.

39:50.282 --> 39:52.015
My guess is, she'll be hungry for more.

40:07.049 --> 40:08.082
I'd better go.

40:15.775 --> 40:16.940
It was really nice meeting you.

40:18.077 --> 40:19.042
You, too.

40:19.078 --> 40:21.779
Enjoy your next adventure.

40:22.965 --> 40:24.014
Thank you.

40:59.000 --> 40:59.950
Are you okay?

41:00.051 --> 41:01.851
I guess.

41:08.252 --> 41:10.402
Adiós México.

41:20.403 --> 41:25.673
