02:24.386 --> 02:27.764
NEW TEXT MESSAGE 1

02:27.765 --> 02:29.065
NEW TEXT MESSAGE 2

02:29.266 --> 02:31.768
Good luck at your new office!

02:31.769 --> 02:35.397
Why'd you leave early
on your farewell party?

03:19.692 --> 03:21.192
I'm PARK Min-jae.

03:21.193 --> 03:23.070
I've been assigned to Civil Affairs.

03:23.445 --> 03:24.745
Nice to meet you.

03:26.198 --> 03:28.325
You're the new guy?

03:29.160 --> 03:31.077
Is this your first post?

03:31.078 --> 03:34.582
I transferred from Yong-chun.
I'm Level 9.

03:34.957 --> 03:36.416
Nice to meet you.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.586
I'm SOHN Ah-young. Level 8.

03:39.086 --> 03:43.841
I look young, right?
I started here right after college.

03:44.341 --> 03:47.219
You got into civil service
after something else?

03:47.845 --> 03:49.470
Hi, new guy.

03:49.471 --> 03:51.848
Could've bought ginseng drinks.

03:51.849 --> 03:55.602
But you bought this cheap one
in case I'm allergic to ginseng?

03:55.603 --> 03:59.606
It turns my pee yellow
and makes my heart race.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.442
Let's try to get along.

04:34.934 --> 04:35.851
Civil affairs.

04:35.852 --> 04:37.227
Could you explain...

04:37.228 --> 04:38.562
Maybe later.

04:53.369 --> 04:55.578
He came on a rainy night as always.

04:55.579 --> 04:57.747
- What do you mean?
- It rained last night.

04:57.748 --> 05:02.252
Right. I love rainy nights, don't you?

05:02.253 --> 05:04.254
It's been months!

05:04.255 --> 05:10.635
After rainy nights,
our market building walls got cracks.

05:10.636 --> 05:14.264
So I checked the forecast
and went on stakeouts.

05:14.265 --> 05:17.100
He shows up whenever it rains!

05:17.101 --> 05:19.520
Is he a serial killer?

05:21.522 --> 05:24.525
What do you think he's doing?

05:26.026 --> 05:28.736
- Urinating?
- For 10 minutes?

05:28.737 --> 05:33.742
Maybe he had to go really badly.
It's possible.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.536
It's sulphuric acid.

05:36.537 --> 05:40.248
He pretends to pee and pours acid!

05:40.249 --> 05:45.795
Sulphuric acid on the cracks
to break it down more.

05:45.796 --> 05:48.006
To cause corrosion!

05:48.007 --> 05:53.386
Drunk folks go and pee there
at nights.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.929
And the graffiti!

05:54.930 --> 05:58.308
That's why it must be redeveloped.

05:58.309 --> 05:59.435
Who are you?

05:59.435 --> 06:00.686
The building owner.

06:00.687 --> 06:04.397
You threatened with thugs
and bought it for cheap.

06:04.398 --> 06:09.569
Think you can redevelop it
without the tenants' consent?

06:09.570 --> 06:10.696
Ma'am!

06:10.697 --> 06:14.907
Mr. Ma purchased it legally
and the redevelopment is undecided.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.451
We'll handle everything.

06:16.452 --> 06:18.953
- Handle what!
- Good luck!

06:18.954 --> 06:24.083
I said the security lights went out
long ago, but you did nothing!

06:24.084 --> 06:25.710
They still didn't fix it?

06:25.711 --> 06:31.716
It's in a dark, back alley!
What if something happens?

06:31.717 --> 06:34.178
Damn civil servants!

06:39.725 --> 06:42.226
What are you doing?

06:42.227 --> 06:44.355
Why'd you take my picture?

06:45.105 --> 06:49.610
Complaint-related evidence collection
process must be recorded too.

06:53.238 --> 06:54.538
Who are you?

06:55.616 --> 06:58.744
Are you the new guy here?

06:59.328 --> 07:02.205
Did you submit a complaint
for the security lights?

07:02.206 --> 07:03.123
What?

07:03.124 --> 07:06.626
If not, please start
by filling out this form.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.838
Everything is done
according to procedure.

07:10.506 --> 07:11.340
Procedure?

07:11.341 --> 07:14.760
Forget that.
Come with me and fix it now.

07:16.512 --> 07:18.222
Number 4, please.

07:19.890 --> 07:23.727
I was here first. Right at 9 o'clock.

07:24.019 --> 07:25.229
Did you take a number?

07:25.230 --> 07:29.483
What number?
I never took a number here before.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.652
Then please start.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.953
Goodbye.

07:35.906 --> 07:37.616
Number 6, please?

07:41.286 --> 07:42.870
PARK MIN-JAE

07:42.871 --> 07:46.500
Mr. Park Min-jae. I'll see you around.

07:55.926 --> 07:57.552
Goblin Granny.

07:57.553 --> 08:00.681
She's the biggest problem in town.

08:01.807 --> 08:03.182
Goblin Granny?

08:03.183 --> 08:04.892
Wherever there's a problem...

08:04.893 --> 08:10.815
She'll find it and report it.
She's our biggest headache.

08:10.816 --> 08:12.317
Put your helmet on.

08:14.820 --> 08:16.405
I'm busy here!

08:17.197 --> 08:18.948
Take your crate!

08:18.949 --> 08:22.452
Know how many complaints
she filed so far?

08:22.453 --> 08:24.163
A staggering 8000!

08:24.830 --> 08:26.582
How is that possible?

08:26.915 --> 08:31.712
She reported a complaint everyday
for 20 years.

08:32.629 --> 08:35.883
Don't block the path! Move it!

08:36.258 --> 08:37.634
People can pass!

08:39.011 --> 08:40.470
What now, ma'am?

08:40.471 --> 08:42.889
Look at the wires! They're ripped up!

08:42.890 --> 08:46.767
If it rains, we'll get electrocuted.

08:46.768 --> 08:48.227
Do something!

08:48.228 --> 08:49.770
They're fine, ma'am.

08:49.771 --> 08:52.899
And look at the sewage.
It's clogged up and reeks.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.903
Stop paging me! What illegal banner?

08:57.154 --> 08:58.905
He got elected President.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.908
So what?
It's time the banner came down!

09:01.909 --> 09:04.619
- But the President...
- Cut it down!

09:04.620 --> 09:06.913
Please let it go this once?

09:06.914 --> 09:12.878
- Hi, Mr. Yang.
- I'm going to quit my job.

09:13.545 --> 09:17.674
- These are minor things.
- Work for your pay.

09:19.927 --> 09:24.055
She complained through
5 different directors here.

09:24.056 --> 09:28.018
And since a Level 6 like me
was a Level 9 like you.

09:30.646 --> 09:34.441
Think you can handle her?

09:38.070 --> 09:39.905
I'll just go by the book.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.782
Number 17, please?

09:43.200 --> 09:44.825
Did you fill out the form?

09:44.826 --> 09:46.126
Of course.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.413
According to procedure.

09:49.915 --> 09:51.333
It's been filed.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.963
- Number 18, please.
- It's me again.

09:58.090 --> 10:02.052
- Number 19, please.
- That's me too.

10:06.098 --> 10:07.398
Ma'am?

10:08.350 --> 10:12.980
If you take all the numbers,
what about the others?

10:13.981 --> 10:14.982
Ms. Sohn?

10:14.983 --> 10:20.195
I'll handle all her complaints.
Could you see to the others?

10:20.737 --> 10:21.989
Ma'am?

10:21.990 --> 10:23.322
I'll take all of them.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.623
Sure.

10:27.744 --> 10:29.044
Here you are.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.459
Min-jag?

10:34.460 --> 10:36.003
The director wants you.

10:36.378 --> 10:37.379
The director?

10:37.380 --> 10:40.006
Chief Yang is at his office, too.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.008
Okay.

10:41.009 --> 10:43.009
Could you do these for me?

10:43.010 --> 10:44.761
Sure. Go ahead.

10:46.888 --> 10:52.019
What's all this?

10:57.399 --> 11:00.027
You prepared so much.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.780
Come in. Have a seat.

11:09.036 --> 11:12.122
You worked at Yong-chun district?

11:12.372 --> 11:15.041
I'm friends with the director there.

11:15.042 --> 11:19.879
Isn't he in a different party?
Friends over politics, sir?

11:19.880 --> 11:22.423
I switched parties to run for office.

11:22.424 --> 11:23.800
I see.

11:24.551 --> 11:27.679
You ran for the people and not the party.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.807
I heard you're a capable man.

11:31.808 --> 11:34.060
Level 9 who works as well as a Level 7.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.062
Level 9 officials work hard.

11:36.063 --> 11:40.067
A building redevelopment is delayed
due to civil complaints.

11:40.942 --> 11:45.656
I read the file Chief Yang gave me.
There is a way, sir.

11:46.823 --> 11:48.407
Our district office...

11:48.408 --> 11:53.080
can issue an order to
to stop the redevelopment.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.581
An order to stop me?

11:55.582 --> 11:57.041
That's crazy!

11:57.042 --> 11:58.085
It's not.

11:58.086 --> 11:59.961
Once the order is issued...

12:00.212 --> 12:05.092
Yelim can file a lawsuit
against our office in protest.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.892
A lawsuit?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.095
Yes.

12:08.096 --> 12:11.097
Yelim purchased it legally.

12:11.098 --> 12:16.477
And the safety diagnosis of it
recently dropped from B to D.

12:16.478 --> 12:19.981
Then our office will lose
the lawsuit for sure.

12:20.232 --> 12:23.109
And the problem of tenants
claiming recent damages...

12:23.110 --> 12:28.239
can be solved by adjusting
the safety diagnosis period.

12:28.240 --> 12:32.828
Why would we issue the order
when we will lose the lawsuit?

12:33.120 --> 12:34.620
I get it.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.873
It shows we did everything
within the legal limits.

12:37.874 --> 12:42.129
A true government style solution!
We don't take responsibility.

12:43.088 --> 12:44.714
What do you think?

12:44.715 --> 12:46.383
Sounds like a good plan.

12:46.758 --> 12:51.137
He was the top-rated
in his class at Yong-chun.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.974
Hope he doesn't become Level 7
and move to City Hall.

12:54.391 --> 12:57.978
I'm happy where I am now.

12:58.395 --> 13:00.105
You scored 950?

13:00.397 --> 13:01.772
I'm impressed.

13:01.773 --> 13:05.277
How long is my TOEIC score valid for?

13:06.153 --> 13:09.489
ENGLISH ACADEMY Two years.
You can still use this score.

13:10.031 --> 13:11.331
What's it for?

13:13.034 --> 13:14.618
The civil service exam.

13:14.619 --> 13:17.622
The Level 7 civil exam?

13:20.167 --> 13:23.127
I never blocked the path!

13:23.128 --> 13:27.381
You put a big sign
and blocked it till just now!

13:27.382 --> 13:30.302
I did? When?

13:30.635 --> 13:33.180
Do you have proof?

13:34.181 --> 13:36.057
Here's the proof!

13:37.017 --> 13:40.686
You broke the Outdoor-Advertisement
Regulation!

13:40.687 --> 13:44.190
Oh, I broke a great law.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.775
I deserve to die.

13:45.776 --> 13:47.076
What?

13:47.444 --> 13:50.196
When will you stop?

13:50.197 --> 13:54.450
We all struggle in this tiny market
to make a living!

13:54.451 --> 14:00.831
Didn't you see the news about
kids getting hurt by standing signs?

14:00.832 --> 14:03.793
It's our civil duty to follow the law!

14:03.794 --> 14:05.211
Whatever!

14:05.212 --> 14:08.714
Young folks these days
are out of their minds!

14:08.715 --> 14:11.217
What did you say!

14:11.218 --> 14:12.802
What about you?

14:12.803 --> 14:15.095
Know what they call you around here?

14:15.096 --> 14:16.806
What! Say it!

14:16.807 --> 14:19.308
- Spill it!
- They call you...

14:19.309 --> 14:22.228
Damn! It's not worth it!

14:22.229 --> 14:24.231
Watch your mouth!

14:28.735 --> 14:30.695
Ramen should be cooked.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.627
I'm home.

14:46.628 --> 14:49.631
Good. Come here and eat.

14:51.508 --> 14:53.509
That's a lot of dumplings.

14:53.510 --> 14:57.013
Is this dumpling soup?

14:58.265 --> 15:02.351
You forgot to put
the dumplings in the freezer.

15:02.352 --> 15:05.021
Gotta eat 'em. Wash your hands.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.524
I'm not hungry.

15:10.527 --> 15:13.279
Did you get your mock exam scores?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.532
Yup. I did.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.583
Why don't you show me?

15:18.660 --> 15:21.037
Showing you won't change anything.

15:22.163 --> 15:25.625
Put it on my desk after you eat or else.

15:26.042 --> 15:28.377
We moved here for your schooling.

15:28.378 --> 15:31.882
Then we should've moved
to a better neighborhood.

15:32.674 --> 15:34.384
We moved for your work.

15:42.434 --> 15:44.811
The developer is going to court?

15:45.937 --> 15:47.313
It's an administrative order.

15:47.314 --> 15:51.318
The district office is doing
some good for a change.

15:51.568 --> 15:55.696
The developer will do anything to win.

15:55.697 --> 15:59.325
I have evidence of them
damaging the building.

15:59.326 --> 16:04.955
They kicked out tenants
without security deposit payouts.

16:04.956 --> 16:09.711
I took pictures of everything.
Hope this helps.

16:10.337 --> 16:14.716
The fate of the market family is at stake.

16:16.468 --> 16:19.679
We'll use your collected evidence.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.147
Thank you.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.364
Ms. Sohn?

16:37.614 --> 16:38.573
Yes?

16:38.574 --> 16:40.991
Where do we keep unused files here?

16:40.992 --> 16:42.369
Unused files?

17:24.869 --> 17:26.169
Sorry.

17:26.454 --> 17:30.624
Your English is so good. I'm jealous.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.752
I study everyday.

17:35.338 --> 17:37.756
So how's business going?

17:37.757 --> 17:40.385
Slowly. My alteration shop is small.

17:40.969 --> 17:45.889
It takes me so long
to thread the needle now.

17:45.890 --> 17:50.602
So let's travel abroad
before we get any older.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.480
Like the States.

17:54.149 --> 17:57.484
Travel? Don't try to fool me.

17:57.485 --> 18:01.031
You catch on too quickly.

18:01.656 --> 18:05.035
So how's business going?

18:06.661 --> 18:09.914
Why do you keep asking?
It's going slowly.

18:24.554 --> 18:26.513
What's with you today?

18:26.514 --> 18:27.814
Here!

18:28.183 --> 18:32.687
What's wrong with me today?

18:33.521 --> 18:34.897
Hello?

18:34.898 --> 18:39.694
Geum-ju?
I'm at the café down the street.

18:40.028 --> 18:43.531
Okay. Bye.

18:45.784 --> 18:46.910
Ok-boon?

18:46.911 --> 18:51.538
Can't we meet up more regularly?

18:51.539 --> 18:53.541
Enough with that!

18:53.833 --> 18:57.419
Geum-ju wants to meet you too.

18:57.420 --> 18:58.720
Jung-shim.

18:58.922 --> 19:04.093
I'm happy meeting you
just for coffee like this.

19:04.094 --> 19:05.720
Stop it, okay?

19:07.555 --> 19:08.855
Fine.

19:24.572 --> 19:26.074
Enjoyed your meeting?

19:44.592 --> 19:49.097
We arrived in L.A. after
flying 12 hours over the Pacific.

19:49.347 --> 19:51.766
So that's L.A.?

19:57.605 --> 19:58.898
Wassup.

19:58.899 --> 20:00.524
Want some what?

20:00.525 --> 20:01.825
Wassup?

20:02.277 --> 20:03.903
Want some what?

20:05.613 --> 20:06.990
Ok-boon?

20:08.116 --> 20:09.616
Geeze!

20:09.617 --> 20:11.243
What are you doing?

20:11.244 --> 20:12.544
What do you mean?

20:13.621 --> 20:17.291
Don't appear suddenly and touch me!

20:17.292 --> 20:21.170
You knew I came.
You asked if I wanted some.

20:21.171 --> 20:22.672
I heard you.

20:23.423 --> 20:27.177
I said 'wassup'.
It means 'how are you'.

20:27.635 --> 20:29.636
Learn some English.

20:29.637 --> 20:30.930
So silly.

20:30.931 --> 20:33.641
What for? I run a little store.

20:34.642 --> 20:36.769
Where's my jacket?

20:39.439 --> 20:41.649
I reformed it well, huh?

20:43.651 --> 20:45.027
Not bad.

20:45.028 --> 20:46.653
Don't like it?

20:46.654 --> 20:50.657
- Then I’ll just rip it up.
- Of course I like it.

20:50.658 --> 20:54.204
It's cool like 'wassup'!

20:54.913 --> 20:56.164
Thanks a lot.

20:56.165 --> 20:58.208
You're welcome.

21:01.586 --> 21:03.213
Bye bye, then.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.471
NAH JUNG-NAM

21:44.837 --> 21:47.257
It means it's expensive.

21:47.715 --> 21:51.635
You go to a clothing store
and see something you love.

21:51.636 --> 21:54.764
What do we say in English?

22:10.738 --> 22:12.038
Now.

22:12.782 --> 22:14.242
How about this expression?

22:15.159 --> 22:16.786
Ask if you can wear it.

22:17.412 --> 22:18.712
Repeat after me.

22:21.374 --> 22:22.417
Good.

22:22.418 --> 22:27.170
How about if the thing you love
is really cheap?

22:27.171 --> 22:28.471
What do we say?

22:32.677 --> 22:36.805
It's so cheap as if you're stealing it.

22:36.806 --> 22:38.141
Ms. Kim?

22:38.766 --> 22:41.144
Could you speak slowly?

22:41.686 --> 22:43.770
Slow down.

22:43.771 --> 22:44.772
Slow... Right.

22:44.773 --> 22:46.691
What was that again?

22:47.275 --> 22:48.067
What?

22:48.068 --> 22:50.820
What to say when it's damn cheap.

22:52.947 --> 22:54.698
Damn cheap?

22:54.699 --> 22:57.535
Like it's stealing?

23:00.288 --> 23:05.584
They teach English for free
at town hall or the library.

23:05.585 --> 23:06.794
Classes for seniors.

23:06.795 --> 23:13.468
I went, but they didn't help.
So I paid big money to learn here.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.345
Ma'am.

23:15.346 --> 23:16.928
There's nothing I can do this time.

23:16.929 --> 23:20.308
It's a toll on the others. I'm sorry.

24:12.902 --> 24:14.028
Wait!

24:14.029 --> 24:15.404
What is it?

24:15.405 --> 24:17.155
Teach me English?

24:17.156 --> 24:17.907
Pardon?

24:17.908 --> 24:22.869
I saw you ramble on
with the American back there.

24:22.870 --> 24:25.872
I attended here to learn English too.

24:25.873 --> 24:30.877
I know you finished the highest level.

24:30.878 --> 24:33.423
That's enough to teach me.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.883
Why do you want to learn English?

24:36.884 --> 24:38.885
Because I need to.

24:38.886 --> 24:44.933
I'm not asking for free lessons.
I'll pay you well.

24:44.934 --> 24:48.646
Money's tight, right?
How about a part-time job?

24:50.690 --> 24:53.900
- I'd like to tutor you, but...
- What?

24:53.901 --> 24:58.905
I'm too busy with
your pile of complaints, ma'am.

24:58.906 --> 25:00.206
I'm sorry.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.085
Jennifer?

25:12.462 --> 25:13.463
Ma'am.

25:13.464 --> 25:15.964
Please don’t joke
on a civil complaint form.

25:15.965 --> 25:18.092
But I am Jennifer.

25:18.926 --> 25:23.931
My teacher gave me that name
at the English academy.

25:25.975 --> 25:27.976
Did you think it over?

25:27.977 --> 25:29.103
About what?

25:29.104 --> 25:30.937
Teaching me English.

25:30.938 --> 25:34.942
Keep going to the English academy.
Jennifer.

25:47.997 --> 25:48.956
Hello?

25:48.957 --> 25:52.335
It's Jennifer. Are you awake?

25:53.127 --> 25:55.086
Who? Jennifer?

25:55.087 --> 25:57.131
Yes! Jennifer!

25:57.882 --> 25:58.966
Goblin Gran...

25:58.967 --> 26:01.886
I mean, Granny Ok-boon?

26:02.970 --> 26:04.972
What time is it?

26:05.515 --> 26:08.975
How'd you get my number?

26:08.976 --> 26:12.103
It was listed on the employee contacts.

26:12.104 --> 26:17.777
That's for the employees.
You can't call me personally.

26:19.487 --> 26:20.655
Anyway. Why'd you call?

26:20.656 --> 26:23.991
What else? Teach me English.

26:26.994 --> 26:29.539
- I'm sorry. I'm hanging up.
- But...

26:31.999 --> 26:33.299
Damn it!

26:40.424 --> 26:41.801
What is she doing?

26:44.011 --> 26:45.805
I keep spilling.

26:48.683 --> 26:50.184
Why is she here?

27:02.530 --> 27:05.658
She practically lives here.

27:06.033 --> 27:07.577
I can't take it.

27:09.203 --> 27:11.539
I'd rather take complaints.

27:14.083 --> 27:16.919
How is the weather this morning?

27:18.671 --> 27:22.215
Ma'am? You're obstructing my duties.

27:22.216 --> 27:24.050
But I told you.

27:24.051 --> 27:26.554
And I told you I can't.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.972
Where are your manners?

27:28.973 --> 27:34.102
If an elderly begs you,
at least pretend to think it over.

27:34.103 --> 27:36.814
Is staking out here like this good manners?

27:39.066 --> 27:41.067
You really can't teach me?

27:41.068 --> 27:42.987
No. I can't, ma'am.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.663
Fine.

27:46.574 --> 27:48.074
I smell trouble.

27:48.075 --> 27:50.077
Then I have no choice.

27:52.747 --> 27:53.706
No!

27:53.707 --> 27:56.083
- I'll be going then.
- Take care, ma'am.

27:57.585 --> 27:59.253
Where are you going?

28:00.838 --> 28:05.508
To put in the complaints
I collected before I go.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.636
A collection of complaints?

28:07.637 --> 28:08.937
Watch it.

28:13.017 --> 28:15.144
- Please!
- Please teach her?

28:17.104 --> 28:18.731
Try writing this first.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.741
I have studied by myself for years.

28:29.742 --> 28:31.869
I know the alphabet.

28:34.163 --> 28:35.463
Really?

28:35.790 --> 28:37.090
Then...

28:37.416 --> 28:38.716
What's this?

28:39.794 --> 28:42.420
Don't think I know? It's a book.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.130
What kind of book?

28:44.131 --> 28:45.431
A word book.

28:46.884 --> 28:50.930
Dic... Dictionary?

28:51.639 --> 28:54.058
It's called a dictionary, right?

28:54.684 --> 28:58.312
But this is a much bigger
resource book.

28:59.146 --> 29:01.440
What is it in English?

29:04.151 --> 29:06.195
One hundred dictionary?

29:08.447 --> 29:10.157
Encyclopedia.

29:12.326 --> 29:13.828
What?

29:18.290 --> 29:19.590
Ency...

29:23.671 --> 29:26.172
Do I have to know a big word like that?

29:26.173 --> 29:30.177
Isn't this a common word?

29:32.680 --> 29:35.974
Right. It's common.

29:35.975 --> 29:36.809
See?

29:36.810 --> 29:40.062
Encyclopedia is a basic word in English.

29:40.730 --> 29:42.030
Right?

29:44.692 --> 29:47.611
Memorize a list of words for tomorrow.

29:48.362 --> 29:51.365
If you pass the test,
I'll teach you English.

29:55.703 --> 29:58.956
Ecology...

29:59.582 --> 30:01.876
It means 'Saeng-tae-hak'. What's that?

30:03.002 --> 30:04.587
Ecology...

30:05.337 --> 30:08.382
Ecology...

30:11.719 --> 30:15.013
What in the world is that?

30:15.014 --> 30:18.517
Ecology, latitude...

30:21.729 --> 30:25.398
Anthro...

30:25.399 --> 30:29.152
Anthropology.

30:29.153 --> 30:33.239
A-n-t-h-r-o-p...

30:33.240 --> 30:36.786
Spelling doesn't count, right?

30:37.411 --> 30:39.747
Write it out in Korean then.

30:40.247 --> 30:42.248
How nice of you.

30:42.249 --> 30:47.421
Anthropology.

31:04.772 --> 31:06.190
You got 75%.

31:06.816 --> 31:08.150
You did well.

31:08.651 --> 31:12.905
But it's less than the promised 80%.

31:14.156 --> 31:16.700
What's the word?

31:17.284 --> 31:18.327
It's too bad.

31:18.328 --> 31:22.081
Frustrated.

31:22.957 --> 31:24.833
I know that word!

31:24.834 --> 31:28.295
Could you count that to make it 80%?

31:30.840 --> 31:33.092
A promise is a promise.

31:35.302 --> 31:36.602
Bye.

31:57.199 --> 31:58.741
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

31:58.742 --> 32:00.243
I'll have one to go, please.

32:00.244 --> 32:01.544
- One?
- Yes.

32:01.745 --> 32:04.206
One soup to go, please!

32:08.002 --> 32:11.255
Why would I leave? I'm staying!

32:11.505 --> 32:13.507
Listen to me.

32:15.342 --> 32:18.011
You're here illegally.

32:18.012 --> 32:21.389
You guys are gangsters!

32:21.390 --> 32:26.270
I'm not a gangster.
But if I was, I'd say this.

32:27.354 --> 32:28.731
You got one month.

32:29.356 --> 32:34.528
Pack up and leave by then.

32:35.362 --> 32:39.157
I'll be right here even after a month!

32:39.158 --> 32:42.785
We were here for 20 years!
You can't kick me out, gangster!

32:42.786 --> 32:44.663
I'm not a gangster!

32:46.749 --> 32:48.375
It's your final notice.

32:49.043 --> 32:50.343
One month.

32:52.171 --> 32:53.922
Damn gangster punk!

32:53.923 --> 32:56.799
Hey, wait!

32:56.800 --> 32:58.051
Baldy!

32:58.052 --> 32:59.428
I'll get you!

33:00.304 --> 33:01.604
Baldy?

33:03.182 --> 33:04.934
Did you just call me that?

33:06.393 --> 33:09.312
No one calls me Baldy.

33:09.313 --> 33:11.314
You're not going anywhere.

33:11.315 --> 33:15.276
Pick up your cigarette butt.

33:15.277 --> 33:16.278
Hey. Stop!

33:16.279 --> 33:18.196
What now?

33:18.197 --> 33:20.908
Turn your head around and stop.

33:30.542 --> 33:35.923
Aren't you the fool
who comes to pee on rainy nights?

33:41.428 --> 33:49.687
I always stay home on rainy nights
listening to sad songs.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.983
You can't fool me!

33:55.359 --> 33:56.443
Don't worry.

33:56.444 --> 33:59.989
Town office is going to court
with them.

34:00.614 --> 34:02.866
I gave them evidence to...

34:03.617 --> 34:05.703
How rude!

34:09.456 --> 34:10.791
Domino's Pizza?

34:11.792 --> 34:13.919
How long will it take if I order now?

34:15.671 --> 34:19.925
Then I'll order.
My address is Hyo-sung Building...

34:22.803 --> 34:25.431
Sorry, I'll call back.

35:09.475 --> 35:13.979
OK ALTERATION SHOP

35:44.510 --> 35:45.969
Geeze!

35:47.513 --> 35:48.889
It's you?

35:52.893 --> 35:57.481
I would never have guessed
you two were brothers.

35:58.398 --> 36:02.527
Mr. Park, you have a brother
in high school?

36:02.528 --> 36:05.531
Dad got drunk and made a mistake.

36:05.906 --> 36:06.782
Why you...

36:06.782 --> 36:08.033
What? It's true.

36:08.034 --> 36:09.618
No, it's not.

36:16.291 --> 36:18.669
Eat up.

36:20.170 --> 36:22.422
- Thank you.
- Sure.

36:30.180 --> 36:32.307
Try some, Mr. Park.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.184
Okay.

36:49.199 --> 36:50.701
Thank you!

37:04.339 --> 37:06.717
Can't he skip tutoring for one night?

37:07.593 --> 37:09.928
Why send him off so soon?

37:10.429 --> 37:13.472
If he skips once, he'll keep skipping.

37:13.473 --> 37:15.601
You're so uptight.

37:16.727 --> 37:18.228
Whatever you say.

37:25.194 --> 37:29.113
But why did you feed him?

37:29.114 --> 37:32.993
The poor boy was eating
uncooked ramen.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.494
So I gave him some food.

37:35.495 --> 37:42.377
Whenever I bumped into him,
I told him to come and eat.

37:43.629 --> 37:46.256
It's lonely eating by myself.

37:50.260 --> 37:51.560
Thank you.

37:59.228 --> 38:02.356
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, okay?

38:02.648 --> 38:05.400
Wherever it is good for you.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.655
What do you mean?

38:10.656 --> 38:14.116
I won't take money or else no lessons.

38:14.117 --> 38:18.789
Then I'd feel bad.

38:19.248 --> 38:20.548
Instead...

38:21.291 --> 38:24.753
Please feed my brother dinner sometimes.

38:25.045 --> 38:29.675
Then I'll feed him so well
he could become a wrestler!

38:34.554 --> 38:36.682
- Move the food.
- Sure.

38:40.310 --> 38:43.897
Today's Wednesday. Let's get started.

38:45.816 --> 38:48.442
No need to use difficult words.

38:48.443 --> 38:51.445
You can communicate with easy words.

38:51.446 --> 38:54.324
Then why'd you make me
memorize all those hard words?

38:57.452 --> 38:58.752
Well...

39:02.708 --> 39:04.041
Then...

39:04.042 --> 39:06.044
Shall we start our first class?

39:08.714 --> 39:10.465
Let's start with 'How are you'.

39:16.596 --> 39:20.726
What do you say to someone
you haven't seen in a while?

39:32.321 --> 39:33.863
- Granny?
- Yes?

39:33.864 --> 39:35.614
Don't write things down.

39:35.615 --> 39:38.702
Speaking will help improve speaking.

39:39.328 --> 39:43.248
Do not write.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.626
Do not write.

39:48.003 --> 39:49.254
JIN-JU'S STORE

39:49.255 --> 39:51.381
Here's to our first class!

40:01.975 --> 40:05.145
It's illegal to drink alcohol
in the street like this.

40:06.646 --> 40:07.946
Wait.

40:08.774 --> 40:11.109
Why didn't you report this?

40:12.110 --> 40:12.903
Man...

40:12.904 --> 40:15.988
Why don't you report yourself?

40:15.989 --> 40:19.242
You're such a stickler.

40:22.371 --> 40:24.790
Let's go after this one drink.

40:25.791 --> 40:32.047
If you're thirty-three,
why aren't you married yet?

40:33.673 --> 40:34.973
I missed my chance.

40:37.677 --> 40:41.806
You're like my grandmother
who passed away.

40:41.807 --> 40:44.809
You must have grand-kids around my age.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.311
No grand-kids.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.649
I don't even have kids.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.151
Ok-boon? Here.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.778
Have some of this too.

40:55.779 --> 40:58.907
You shouldn't have.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.411
We'll go after this one cup.

41:03.412 --> 41:05.788
It's illegal to drink here.

41:05.789 --> 41:07.707
What? Since when?

41:08.583 --> 41:11.211
It's okay. You're drinking with me.

41:11.962 --> 41:13.839
- I'd like some too.
- Sure.

41:17.843 --> 41:21.847
- You grew up in Busan?
- Yes.

41:22.597 --> 41:26.559
Then, do you know where to go fish?

41:26.560 --> 41:32.566
Fish? Busan is a port city.
There is fish everywhere.

41:32.858 --> 41:35.318
No, you're wrong.

41:35.986 --> 41:39.072
The fish is not there.

41:39.865 --> 41:41.700
Then where is it?

41:43.452 --> 41:45.120
In a hand...

41:47.956 --> 41:49.875
In a hand...

41:51.460 --> 41:56.131
In a hand? Cards?

41:58.884 --> 42:00.184
Go fish?

42:03.472 --> 42:05.265
Wow. I need to go.

42:13.773 --> 42:16.902
Know where memory lane is?

42:17.402 --> 42:20.780
Memory lane?

42:21.239 --> 42:22.157
Yup.

42:22.158 --> 42:26.036
Isn't that in our heads?

42:26.870 --> 42:28.170
Wrong.

42:29.664 --> 42:30.964
Then where?

42:31.666 --> 42:32.966
My hometown.

42:34.920 --> 42:44.930
I remember the lane

42:45.931 --> 42:55.941
I wore the flower ring you made me

42:56.691 --> 43:06.785
And walked hand in hand with you

43:20.966 --> 43:22.266
It's too long.

43:24.052 --> 43:27.597
Whoever speaks Korean
gets flicked in the forehead.

44:17.480 --> 44:18.780
Urajil! (Damn!)

44:19.024 --> 44:20.324
Urajil?

44:40.670 --> 44:42.547
You want some ice coffee?

45:20.585 --> 45:24.088
You hit me on purpose to make me mad!

45:24.089 --> 45:26.840
You spoke in Korean!

45:26.841 --> 45:28.217
You get a flick!

45:28.218 --> 45:29.518
Come here!

45:34.099 --> 45:36.685
When you don't want coins...

45:39.187 --> 45:41.606
When your head hurts...

45:45.944 --> 45:48.446
When you feel sad...

45:53.243 --> 45:54.743
Mr. Park,

45:54.744 --> 45:56.044
thank you.

45:56.996 --> 45:58.873
When you meet in a while...

46:02.502 --> 46:04.087
When you're busy...

46:07.716 --> 46:09.342
When you say goodbye...

46:23.148 --> 46:25.733
It's no use just studying at a desk.

46:25.734 --> 46:28.778
You have to talk with native speakers.

46:31.781 --> 46:34.284
Go talk to them in English.

46:35.869 --> 46:40.039
Talk to them for at least 5 minutes.

46:41.875 --> 46:43.175
5 minutes?

47:30.215 --> 47:31.716
See there?

47:45.230 --> 47:47.064
English isn't so hard!

47:47.065 --> 47:50.567
Talking to them face to face
really helps.

47:50.568 --> 47:53.487
And with you beside me,
I don't feel scared.

47:53.488 --> 47:56.241
I can talk so easily and freely.

48:00.119 --> 48:01.704
When my brother was young...

48:02.497 --> 48:05.250
I lived away from home for schooling.

48:06.251 --> 48:10.380
We started living together
when he was a teenager.

48:12.257 --> 48:16.886
After I graduated
and began studying abroad...

48:17.512 --> 48:20.265
- Are you okay?
- Yup.

48:21.140 --> 48:23.226
Maybe you drank too much.

48:28.481 --> 48:31.025
While studying abroad,
my mom passed away.

49:28.333 --> 49:31.336
Your story is so sad.

49:32.462 --> 49:35.423
You understood everything?

49:36.716 --> 49:38.016
Well...

49:39.719 --> 49:42.347
I can tell by the tone of your voice.

49:48.436 --> 49:50.563
Happy Thanksgiving!

49:52.357 --> 49:54.359
What fool came up with this idea?

49:54.692 --> 49:55.992
Me.

49:56.361 --> 49:59.863
- The director complimented me.
- Oh...

49:59.864 --> 50:02.115
Happy Thanksgiving!

50:02.116 --> 50:03.826
Hurray!

50:07.830 --> 50:10.375
Are you going anywhere during the holidays?

50:11.376 --> 50:13.585
No, I’ll just sleep in.

50:13.586 --> 50:15.003
Right.

50:15.004 --> 50:19.508
Being single at our age,
family gatherings aren't fun.

50:19.509 --> 50:23.388
They set me up on a few blind dates.

50:27.016 --> 50:28.518
Should I go?

50:30.395 --> 50:32.397
Why are you asking me?

50:36.025 --> 50:37.151
You'll regret it.

50:37.152 --> 50:39.653
Hurray!

50:39.654 --> 50:42.407
Happy Thanksgiving!

50:57.630 --> 50:58.930
Come in.

51:12.520 --> 51:13.438
Wait!

51:13.438 --> 51:14.439
Leave him.

51:14.440 --> 51:18.942
It's best to eat it right off the pan.

51:18.943 --> 51:20.820
- It's hot!
- It's good!

51:34.834 --> 51:36.835
But I don't like fish.

51:36.836 --> 51:38.963
Just stuff it in!

51:45.428 --> 51:46.728
Wow!

51:47.805 --> 51:49.474
It tasted like this?

51:50.099 --> 51:51.399
It's good!

51:52.185 --> 51:53.728
Granny, one more.

51:55.480 --> 51:57.732
You have mature tastes now.

52:06.741 --> 52:08.367
Granny?

52:10.244 --> 52:11.596
Eat it yourself.

52:14.582 --> 52:18.460
The moon is huge!

52:18.461 --> 52:20.253
It's a full moon.

52:20.254 --> 52:22.632
Let's not make wishes on the moon.

52:30.515 --> 52:35.353
Granny. Why are you learning English?

52:41.651 --> 52:43.528
I have a younger brother.

52:45.613 --> 52:47.781
We were separated as kids.

52:47.782 --> 52:50.034
He lives in the States now.

52:53.121 --> 52:55.998
He doesn't speak Korean.

52:59.544 --> 53:02.380
Was he adopted away?

53:03.673 --> 53:06.884
I want to call him,
but we can't communicate.

53:08.553 --> 53:13.307
I wonder how he's doing.

53:13.766 --> 53:15.810
If he's sick or not...

53:16.185 --> 53:17.937
How his kids are doing...

53:18.563 --> 53:21.065
I'm so curious.

53:24.152 --> 53:26.070
That's why I'm learning English.

53:29.574 --> 53:32.076
I need to use the toilet.

54:00.730 --> 54:03.733
We can’t just sit and watch.

54:05.860 --> 54:07.862
Let's make wishes on the moon.

54:29.508 --> 54:30.808
Sis!

54:31.260 --> 54:32.560
Jung-nam!

54:41.479 --> 54:43.981
I'll bake potatoes for you at home.

55:50.965 --> 55:53.092
Going up the stairs...

55:53.801 --> 55:56.053
Why does it decrease life expectancy?

55:58.723 --> 56:02.977
- The arrows are on backwards.
- Oops.

56:05.604 --> 56:06.904
Just leave 'em.

56:07.356 --> 56:08.733
No one will know.

56:24.707 --> 56:28.210
Come earlier for dinner.
- Granny Ok-boon

56:39.472 --> 56:41.015
Not hungry?

56:43.017 --> 56:46.520
Let's stop learning English.

56:47.480 --> 56:51.150
What the hell do you mean?

56:51.734 --> 56:57.114
Well, I have to take
the Level 7 exam soon and all.

56:57.406 --> 56:58.991
I'm very busy.

57:00.659 --> 57:01.994
I see.

57:03.913 --> 57:08.626
How about once or twice a week?

57:09.377 --> 57:12.295
And let me pay for the lessons.

57:12.296 --> 57:17.134
You insisted, but I felt bad
for not paying you.

57:20.554 --> 57:22.681
I'm really sorry.

57:33.275 --> 57:37.530
I'd better get going. I'm sorry.

58:19.738 --> 58:21.115
Ok-boon.

58:23.325 --> 58:24.618
Are you okay?

58:24.619 --> 58:27.078
Is she the friend?

58:27.079 --> 58:29.832
The one you talk about all the time?

58:30.374 --> 58:31.674
Yes.

58:32.835 --> 58:34.879
My best friend.

58:35.379 --> 58:38.132
Right. Best friend.

58:50.895 --> 58:54.231
I'm sorry I'm like this.

58:54.899 --> 58:56.775
Don't say that.

58:58.152 --> 59:00.905
Just get better and back up again.

59:01.906 --> 59:08.787
My memory comes and goes. I'm not well.

59:19.673 --> 59:21.425
Remember this?

59:23.385 --> 59:28.807
Of course. How could I ever forget this?

59:29.517 --> 59:31.060
Jung-shim.

59:32.269 --> 59:36.524
Why are you so sick all of a sudden?

59:37.066 --> 59:40.194
Why are you crying?

59:41.695 --> 59:42.995
Don't cry.

59:43.948 --> 59:46.199
Just like the past...

59:46.200 --> 59:50.412
You're still full of tears.

59:54.708 --> 59:56.418
Granny?

1:00:06.971 --> 1:00:08.556
Granny Jung-shim...

1:00:10.224 --> 1:00:12.476
It'll be hard for her now.

1:00:13.477 --> 1:00:20.985
In a few months,
she may not even remember her name.

1:00:23.737 --> 1:00:28.492
Could you help, Granny Ok-boon?

1:00:32.871 --> 1:00:34.171
Would it be hard?

1:00:34.999 --> 1:00:39.628
Would you do it for Granny Jung-shim?

1:00:40.004 --> 1:00:43.757
It's your best friend's final wish.

1:00:50.639 --> 1:00:51.939
What school do you go to?

1:00:52.391 --> 1:00:55.393
I swear I didn't know, sir!

1:00:55.394 --> 1:00:58.104
You should've checked his ID.

1:00:58.105 --> 1:01:02.025
I did, sir.
First, there were three of them.

1:01:02.026 --> 1:01:04.027
Then there were four.

1:01:04.028 --> 1:01:06.029
I was busy running the shop alone.

1:01:06.030 --> 1:01:07.031
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

1:01:07.032 --> 1:01:10.033
Whatsoever, you sold beer to a minor.

1:01:10.034 --> 1:01:10.659
No.

1:01:10.660 --> 1:01:13.286
- Let's go to the station.
- Wait!

1:01:13.287 --> 1:01:15.371
- It was you.
- What?

1:01:15.372 --> 1:01:18.916
You reported that I sold beer
to a minor, didn't you!

1:01:18.917 --> 1:01:23.046
That's crazy!
Why would I do such a thing?

1:01:23.047 --> 1:01:26.799
Who else would do that around here?

1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:29.677
- Who do you think I am!
- Let's go.

1:01:29.678 --> 1:01:30.928
A crazy woman!

1:01:30.929 --> 1:01:33.556
Always going around looking for
something to report!

1:01:33.557 --> 1:01:36.184
- Get in!
- You'll pay for this.

1:01:36.185 --> 1:01:37.561
- Back off, ma'am.
- Wait!

1:01:43.275 --> 1:01:46.945
Not teaching English
to Granny these days?

1:01:50.074 --> 1:01:53.077
No. Stuff happened.

1:01:54.828 --> 1:01:57.081
A new restaurant opened up.

1:01:57.456 --> 1:01:59.416
Go buy dinner there.

1:02:09.718 --> 1:02:12.096
Did you bring your documents?

1:02:13.097 --> 1:02:14.848
I'll take those.

1:02:15.099 --> 1:02:16.399
Great.

1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:37.496
Damn.

1:02:37.996 --> 1:02:39.747
Look at them!

1:02:39.748 --> 1:02:43.126
It's illegal to smoke
in front of buildings.

1:02:43.127 --> 1:02:46.130
I stayed low too long. Those fools!

1:02:47.756 --> 1:02:51.342
I heard Yelim construction
sued your department.

1:02:51.343 --> 1:02:53.511
What if you get reprimanded?

1:02:53.512 --> 1:02:55.596
It's all a setup.

1:02:55.597 --> 1:02:59.142
We'll lose and put an end
to the market people's complaints.

1:02:59.143 --> 1:03:01.144
We can say we did our best.

1:03:01.145 --> 1:03:03.897
Then Yelim can redevelop it.
It's a win-win deal.

1:03:04.148 --> 1:03:05.498
What are you talking about?

1:03:06.775 --> 1:03:08.901
What do you mean it's a setup?

1:03:08.902 --> 1:03:11.529
I was talking about
setting up new posters.

1:03:11.530 --> 1:03:16.242
I heard you talking about
our market redevelopment.

1:03:16.243 --> 1:03:18.161
Well, if you heard everything...

1:03:18.162 --> 1:03:22.373
We can't prove the developer
caused damages to the building.

1:03:22.374 --> 1:03:27.170
Please stop filing complaints
and bear with us, ma'am!

1:03:27.171 --> 1:03:30.131
Think you can fool me!

1:03:30.132 --> 1:03:32.926
They own it!
They can rebuild if they want!

1:03:36.013 --> 1:03:38.557
Give back the evidence!

1:03:39.183 --> 1:03:39.892
Pardon?

1:03:39.893 --> 1:03:43.437
The evidence I said to use
in the lawsuit.

1:03:43.937 --> 1:03:48.399
The pictures of the developer
pouring acid to ruin the building!

1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:51.028
Look through Mr. Park's desk.

1:03:52.196 --> 1:03:54.071
I think it was shredded.

1:03:54.072 --> 1:03:57.200
Shredded? It's gone?

1:03:57.201 --> 1:03:58.160
Yes.

1:03:58.160 --> 1:03:59.328
You did it?

1:03:59.329 --> 1:04:01.829
Well, not really.

1:04:01.830 --> 1:04:03.207
Tell Mr. Park to come!

1:04:04.333 --> 1:04:05.834
I'm almost there.

1:04:06.335 --> 1:04:09.086
- What do you mean?
- I didn't know.

1:04:09.087 --> 1:04:10.463
It's all shredded?

1:04:10.464 --> 1:04:12.215
Where's Mr. Park!

1:04:12.216 --> 1:04:13.967
You said it's unused.

1:04:14.218 --> 1:04:16.720
I meant for it to be kept in storage.

1:04:17.221 --> 1:04:19.223
You dare lie to me!

1:04:21.225 --> 1:04:23.726
It's an administrative process.

1:04:23.727 --> 1:04:25.686
But don't worry about your shop.

1:04:25.687 --> 1:04:28.231
Only the stores across from you
will be redeveloped.

1:04:28.232 --> 1:04:32.235
Think I collected that for years
just for me?

1:04:32.236 --> 1:04:34.946
The pork shop girl works hard.

1:04:34.947 --> 1:04:39.367
To support her mom,
she has no time to date.

1:04:39.368 --> 1:04:42.245
If she gets kicked out, what will she do?

1:04:42.246 --> 1:04:43.546
Granny Ok-boon.

1:04:43.831 --> 1:04:47.625
No one cares that you go around
reporting things for them.

1:04:47.626 --> 1:04:49.335
Worry about yourself.

1:04:49.336 --> 1:04:51.379
No one's thankful!

1:04:51.380 --> 1:04:54.131
I'm not doing it to be thanked.

1:04:54.132 --> 1:04:57.718
It's where I live and they live there too!

1:04:57.719 --> 1:05:00.639
How could you lie to me!

1:05:01.014 --> 1:05:04.267
I didn't mean to, but I guess I lied.

1:05:04.268 --> 1:05:05.643
I'm sorry.

1:05:05.644 --> 1:05:10.023
Sorry? Is that why
you taught me English?

1:05:10.649 --> 1:05:12.900
That's right.

1:05:12.901 --> 1:05:17.281
I did it out of guilt!
I felt bad for you!

1:05:28.292 --> 1:05:29.877
And one more thing.

1:05:30.502 --> 1:05:34.298
No need for you to learn English.
I called your brother.

1:05:34.673 --> 1:05:38.051
He doesn't want to talk to you.

1:05:38.427 --> 1:05:40.053
Or meet you.

1:05:40.304 --> 1:05:43.180
He doesn't even want to remember you.

1:05:43.181 --> 1:05:47.768
So there's no need for you
to learn English now!

1:05:47.769 --> 1:05:49.313
You lie!

1:06:00.407 --> 1:06:02.326
Ma'am! Are you okay?

1:06:07.331 --> 1:06:09.833
- Granny?
- Are you all right?

1:06:26.058 --> 1:06:27.358
Where did she go?

1:06:44.117 --> 1:06:45.577
Did you just smoke?

1:06:50.958 --> 1:06:51.750
Hey!

1:06:51.750 --> 1:06:53.050
What?

1:06:55.629 --> 1:06:57.755
I'm stressed. Let it go.

1:06:57.756 --> 1:06:59.007
What's with you?

1:06:59.008 --> 1:07:01.385
Don't act like you're my old man.

1:07:02.386 --> 1:07:04.137
I'm your guardian.

1:07:07.391 --> 1:07:10.143
Right. You're my guardian.

1:07:11.395 --> 1:07:15.983
So you gave up your dreams
to support me.

1:07:18.402 --> 1:07:20.278
Got a problem with me?

1:07:26.410 --> 1:07:27.710
Young-jae!

1:07:43.260 --> 1:07:46.430
Do you know why
she meddles in everyone's lives?

1:07:47.889 --> 1:07:49.307
Because she's lonely.

1:07:52.561 --> 1:07:59.526
She lived her whole life alone
without any family.

1:08:02.654 --> 1:08:07.075
How could you do that to her?

1:09:05.425 --> 1:09:07.093
Wait! Please!

1:09:07.094 --> 1:09:11.847
How can you shut me down in a month?

1:09:11.848 --> 1:09:13.474
Please hear me out.

1:09:13.475 --> 1:09:18.605
You should've sold it to us before.

1:09:22.192 --> 1:09:24.986
Why make me report you?

1:09:27.614 --> 1:09:29.865
It was you?

1:09:29.866 --> 1:09:32.326
Why not cooperate sooner?

1:09:32.327 --> 1:09:34.245
Damn assholes!

1:09:34.246 --> 1:09:35.546
Hey!

1:09:37.833 --> 1:09:40.000
Are you okay?

1:09:40.001 --> 1:09:40.836
Oh no!

1:09:40.837 --> 1:09:42.586
Stop it!

1:09:42.587 --> 1:09:45.881
Tell the boys to destroy this place.

1:09:45.882 --> 1:09:47.384
Everyone stop!

1:09:50.595 --> 1:09:52.097
Who are you?

1:09:52.764 --> 1:09:54.599
I'm from the district office.

1:09:55.725 --> 1:09:57.602
Nice to meet you!

1:09:58.603 --> 1:10:03.608
I tried to handle this
without your help, sir.

1:10:11.116 --> 1:10:13.118
We work for Yelim.

1:10:15.162 --> 1:10:17.372
What's external support?

1:10:18.290 --> 1:10:21.001
We support things externally?

1:10:22.043 --> 1:10:24.628
She's on a private property illegally.

1:10:24.629 --> 1:10:25.630
No, I'm not.

1:10:25.631 --> 1:10:27.423
It's my store.

1:10:27.424 --> 1:10:30.009
She doesn't own it.

1:10:30.010 --> 1:10:33.179
The lawsuit is still pending.

1:10:33.180 --> 1:10:38.142
Interrupting a business like this
is illegal.

1:10:38.143 --> 1:10:40.145
That's right!

1:10:41.813 --> 1:10:43.113
A lawsuit?

1:10:44.441 --> 1:10:46.442
The lawsuit was your idea.

1:10:46.443 --> 1:10:50.321
I said there's a way.
I didn't say to do it.

1:10:50.322 --> 1:10:51.655
Sneaky fool!

1:10:51.656 --> 1:10:53.949
The director will lose out.

1:10:53.950 --> 1:10:56.536
That's none of my concern.

1:10:56.912 --> 1:10:57.662
I'm sorry.

1:10:57.663 --> 1:10:59.580
Let's act like civil officials.

1:10:59.581 --> 1:11:00.915
What's our creed?

1:11:00.916 --> 1:11:03.792
Stay low. Be indifferent.

1:11:03.793 --> 1:11:07.339
So I’m just standing by.

1:11:07.589 --> 1:11:11.592
FORCED REMOVAL PROHIBITED
- DISTRICT OFFICE

1:11:11.593 --> 1:11:15.179
- Be the next director!
- No.

1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:16.480
Take care.

1:11:18.433 --> 1:11:21.186
Thank you very much.

1:11:21.937 --> 1:11:24.439
- I didn't do anything.
- Come on.

1:11:25.106 --> 1:11:26.406
Take care.

1:11:53.718 --> 1:11:58.515
You gnashed your teeth
till you lost them all.

1:11:59.391 --> 1:12:01.518
Get up Jung-shim.

1:12:02.978 --> 1:12:08.275
You said you'll live long
and bring them to their knees!

1:12:10.026 --> 1:12:16.116
You saved me from dying.
You should be healthier!

1:12:29.629 --> 1:12:31.797
She doesn't recognize me now.

1:12:31.798 --> 1:12:35.176
How could she forget that
of all things?

1:12:40.807 --> 1:12:48.773
When she was better,
she wrote this to give you.

1:13:08.418 --> 1:13:09.961
Hello, ma'am.

1:13:11.796 --> 1:13:13.923
Granny NAH Ok-boon, right?

1:13:14.341 --> 1:13:16.967
Yes. Who are you?

1:13:16.968 --> 1:13:22.681
You can't barge in here.
I didn't tell her anything yet.

1:13:22.682 --> 1:13:24.850
That's why I came.
I came to ask her myself.

1:13:24.851 --> 1:13:27.811
We haven't discussed it yet.

1:13:27.812 --> 1:13:30.856
But it's all been decided.

1:13:30.857 --> 1:13:32.733
She has to know anyway.

1:13:32.734 --> 1:13:35.194
Yes, but not like this.

1:13:35.195 --> 1:13:36.821
- Look.
- Please leave.

1:13:37.489 --> 1:13:39.490
What are you two talking about?

1:13:39.491 --> 1:13:40.824
I'll explain later.

1:13:40.825 --> 1:13:44.621
Hello, ma'am.
I'm a reporter for Fair News.

1:13:45.622 --> 1:13:50.626
But I came as a member of
the HR 121 coalition.

1:13:50.627 --> 1:13:55.089
It was formed by human rights groups
wanting the U.S. House of Reps...

1:13:55.090 --> 1:13:57.758
to pass Resolution 121.

1:13:57.759 --> 1:14:02.347
- We want the Japanese to...
- Reporter!

1:14:03.264 --> 1:14:04.849
Not now, please.

1:14:06.851 --> 1:14:08.151
Let him talk.

1:14:10.730 --> 1:14:12.899
I'm done hiding.

1:14:14.859 --> 1:14:16.159
Jin-ju!

1:14:16.611 --> 1:14:18.028
- Jin-ju!
- What?

1:14:18.029 --> 1:14:21.533
- See this?
- What is it?

1:14:21.866 --> 1:14:23.159
It's Granny!

1:14:23.160 --> 1:14:28.373
'COMFORT WOMEN' HEARING TO BE HELD
IN U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

1:14:37.882 --> 1:14:40.135
My name is NAH Ok-boon.

1:14:40.927 --> 1:14:44.806
- In 1943, when I was thirteen...
- Did you know?

1:14:45.807 --> 1:14:48.768
YOUNG-JAE: I was taken away to
Manchuria against my will.

1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:56.700
Mom?

1:14:57.902 --> 1:15:02.699
I was going to hide it till the day I die.

1:15:05.910 --> 1:15:09.038
I promised that with you.

1:15:11.082 --> 1:15:13.543
But I can't keep the promise.

1:15:15.462 --> 1:15:19.591
No, I won't keep it.

1:15:24.095 --> 1:15:26.931
More than you, Jung-shim...

1:15:29.434 --> 1:15:33.980
More than Jung-shim, I'm more important.

1:15:35.940 --> 1:15:39.861
Mom? Why'd you do it.

1:15:41.946 --> 1:15:44.073
Why'd you blame me?

1:15:45.742 --> 1:15:51.080
Afraid I'd hold your son back,
you kept quiet.

1:15:54.501 --> 1:16:00.965
How could I live well
when my family abandoned me?

1:16:04.219 --> 1:16:08.973
'My poor girl. It must've hurt!'

1:16:11.226 --> 1:16:13.895
Why didn't you say that?

1:16:15.021 --> 1:16:17.106
Just once!

1:16:17.982 --> 1:16:19.484
Mom!

1:16:20.151 --> 1:16:22.403
Mom...

1:16:25.281 --> 1:16:27.367
Mom...

1:17:23.548 --> 1:17:25.049
Did you eat?

1:17:27.218 --> 1:17:30.430
I was away for a few days, but I'll cook.

1:17:30.722 --> 1:17:33.308
- Wait here.
- I'm sorry, Granny.

1:17:36.686 --> 1:17:38.062
I'm so sorry.

1:17:40.690 --> 1:17:45.570
What do you have
to be sorry for?

1:17:46.613 --> 1:17:47.913
I'm sorry.

1:17:49.365 --> 1:17:50.665
I'm so sorry.

1:18:53.763 --> 1:18:55.807
It's a memory I want to forget.

1:18:57.642 --> 1:18:59.811
But I didn't throw that away.

1:19:02.188 --> 1:19:04.315
If I forget, I'd be losing.

1:19:09.028 --> 1:19:12.156
I didn't show it to anyone
for over 60 years.

1:19:14.325 --> 1:19:22.792
Showing it to you
makes me feel somewhat better.

1:19:30.216 --> 1:19:31.801
Jung-shim...

1:19:33.678 --> 1:19:35.972
She saved my life.

1:19:50.695 --> 1:19:53.239
MANCHURIA, 1943

1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:55.540
It's my turn!

1:19:55.742 --> 1:19:57.367
I waited a long time.

1:19:57.368 --> 1:19:59.078
I'm not done yet!

1:20:00.371 --> 1:20:03.749
It's not finished.

1:20:03.750 --> 1:20:06.251
Help me!

1:20:06.252 --> 1:20:07.837
I'll draw it nicely!

1:20:09.005 --> 1:20:11.591
Draw the Rising Sun flag, sir.

1:20:12.091 --> 1:20:12.967
Please stop!

1:20:12.968 --> 1:20:14.510
Shut up!

1:20:26.147 --> 1:20:27.447
Ok-boon!

1:20:42.747 --> 1:20:47.417
Ok-boon, wake up!

1:20:47.418 --> 1:20:49.295
Why won't you let me die!

1:20:50.254 --> 1:20:52.381
Can't I even choose to die?

1:20:52.924 --> 1:20:56.260
Can't I even end my own life at will?

1:21:17.156 --> 1:21:21.035
How can I survive without you?

1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:35.591
Why can't I do it like you?

1:21:37.301 --> 1:21:40.304
I'll make one for you too.

1:21:41.597 --> 1:21:45.184
- Really?
- Yup,

1:21:49.313 --> 1:21:53.317
Let's wipe our tears away on this
and cheer up.

1:21:55.319 --> 1:21:56.619
Okay?

1:21:59.073 --> 1:22:00.373
Promise.

1:22:05.329 --> 1:22:06.372
Jung-shim...

1:22:06.373 --> 1:22:12.003
She went around
to testify what happened.

1:22:14.338 --> 1:22:16.382
Once, she went to Nagoya.

1:22:17.341 --> 1:22:27.350
The interpreter said we crawled in
because we wanted to eat rice.

1:22:27.351 --> 1:22:30.646
He translated it all wrong!

1:22:32.607 --> 1:22:37.361
After that, Jung-shim
studied English like hell.

1:22:38.529 --> 1:22:44.493
She wanted to tell the whole world
what we went through.

1:22:50.374 --> 1:22:54.795
She wrote that for the hearing.

1:22:59.425 --> 1:23:03.012
From a few years ago...

1:23:03.554 --> 1:23:07.391
Jung-shim started losing her memory.

1:23:08.309 --> 1:23:11.395
I think I knew then...

1:23:12.396 --> 1:23:17.902
that someday I'll have to do it instead.

1:23:18.444 --> 1:23:21.906
That's why I studied English.

1:23:26.410 --> 1:23:27.828
Mr. Park.

1:23:29.455 --> 1:23:34.543
Would you help me one last time?

1:23:57.608 --> 1:23:59.110
Wait, Jin-ju!

1:23:59.986 --> 1:24:01.286
Jin-ju!

1:24:03.489 --> 1:24:06.242
Why do you keep avoiding me?

1:24:08.452 --> 1:24:09.752
I did not.

1:24:10.329 --> 1:24:11.629
See!

1:24:11.872 --> 1:24:14.375
You're avoiding my eyes.

1:24:15.376 --> 1:24:21.132
Don't want to be friends
because of my past?

1:24:23.467 --> 1:24:24.510
That's crazy.

1:24:24.511 --> 1:24:27.763
You pretend not to see me!

1:24:31.100 --> 1:24:33.018
It's because I was hurt.

1:24:33.019 --> 1:24:34.319
I'm hurt!

1:24:35.021 --> 1:24:37.106
I got sick because I'm so hurt!

1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:41.200
You know?

1:24:41.485 --> 1:24:44.655
How mad I was at you
for the past few days?

1:24:45.281 --> 1:24:48.993
We were friends for years.

1:24:49.744 --> 1:24:50.494
But...

1:24:50.495 --> 1:24:54.498
You never told me anything.

1:24:55.166 --> 1:25:00.796
If you told me,
I would've done anything to help.

1:25:02.798 --> 1:25:05.133
You couldn't trust me?

1:25:05.134 --> 1:25:09.012
Do I look like a half-wit
who wouldn't understand?

1:25:09.013 --> 1:25:10.313
Of course not!

1:25:10.556 --> 1:25:14.518
You're my dearest friend.

1:25:19.523 --> 1:25:21.025
Then Why'd you do it?

1:25:23.069 --> 1:25:27.948
You must've been in so much pain.

1:25:29.033 --> 1:25:32.203
You flinched when anyone touched you...

1:25:32.912 --> 1:25:34.455
That's why?

1:25:36.082 --> 1:25:38.542
I had no idea...

1:25:44.548 --> 1:25:45.848
I'm sorry.

1:25:47.927 --> 1:25:50.179
I'm really sorry.

1:25:56.852 --> 1:25:58.604
How could you?

1:26:00.106 --> 1:26:02.108
Why didn't you tell me?

1:26:03.359 --> 1:26:05.861
All those years alone...

1:26:07.571 --> 1:26:10.950
It must've been so hard.

1:26:12.493 --> 1:26:15.121
It must've hurt so much.

1:26:17.581 --> 1:26:24.213
My poor, dear friend.

1:26:41.147 --> 1:26:43.731
Ready, ma'am? I'm ready.

1:26:43.732 --> 1:26:46.526
I'll take your picture now.

1:26:46.527 --> 1:26:48.528
Smile, please?

1:26:48.529 --> 1:26:49.613
No?

1:26:49.613 --> 1:26:50.913
I'll just take it.

1:27:01.792 --> 1:27:03.092
Nice picture.

1:27:52.343 --> 1:27:53.677
What's this?

1:28:04.188 --> 1:28:08.943
I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING.
HAVE A SAFE TRIP TO THE U.S.

1:28:37.888 --> 1:28:40.390
Presents for your U.S. trip.

1:28:40.391 --> 1:28:42.517
This is from the fish shop.

1:28:42.518 --> 1:28:44.769
This is from the dried foods.

1:28:44.770 --> 1:28:48.523
This is from the noodle shop.

1:28:48.524 --> 1:28:49.733
What?

1:28:49.734 --> 1:28:51.902
They're all for you.

1:29:04.748 --> 1:29:06.250
Look at this.

1:29:08.377 --> 1:29:09.794
What's that?

1:29:09.795 --> 1:29:12.755
I made it for you to wear
to your interview.

1:29:12.756 --> 1:29:13.882
You did?

1:29:13.883 --> 1:29:17.677
When I was young,
I wanted to run a tailor shop.

1:29:17.678 --> 1:29:18.978
Wow!

1:29:19.305 --> 1:29:21.765
Take that off and try it on.

1:29:23.309 --> 1:29:26.311
It's made of 100% wool.

1:29:26.312 --> 1:29:27.771
The best there is.

1:29:31.191 --> 1:29:32.151
What do you think?

1:29:32.152 --> 1:29:34.027
It fits you perfectly.

1:29:34.028 --> 1:29:35.696
- Really?
- Yup,

1:29:41.702 --> 1:29:45.706
WASHINGTON D.C., U.S.

1:29:50.294 --> 1:29:51.795
Geum-ju?

1:29:52.588 --> 1:29:53.888
Yes, Granny?

1:29:55.716 --> 1:29:58.469
How far is L.A. from here?

1:29:58.844 --> 1:30:00.720
Los Angeles?

1:30:00.721 --> 1:30:02.473
No, L.A.

1:30:03.807 --> 1:30:05.476
Right, L.A.

1:30:06.602 --> 1:30:10.230
It's about 4~5 hours by plane.

1:30:11.231 --> 1:30:14.818
Why? Do you know someone there?

1:30:15.986 --> 1:30:18.238
No. Just curious.

1:30:20.991 --> 1:30:24.827
You'll be transferred elsewhere, right?

1:30:24.828 --> 1:30:26.622
How much is your raise?

1:30:26.997 --> 1:30:31.251
Nothing's decided.
I have to pass my interview first.

1:30:31.877 --> 1:30:40.135
I knew you wouldn't stay long
since I first met you.

1:30:41.845 --> 1:30:43.847
So I didn't open my heart.

1:30:46.225 --> 1:30:50.854
If I had, you would've given up
on the Level 7 exam.

1:30:52.856 --> 1:30:57.486
Forgive me for acting cold
for your future.

1:31:00.906 --> 1:31:03.867
What do you mean?

1:31:07.371 --> 1:31:09.873
Just thought I should say it.

1:31:13.877 --> 1:31:14.378
Look!

1:31:14.379 --> 1:31:15.920
Terrible newsflash.

1:31:15.921 --> 1:31:21.926
The comfort women hearing
is in danger of being canceled.

1:31:21.927 --> 1:31:26.764
The Japanese has questioned
the qualifications of the witnesses.

1:31:26.765 --> 1:31:32.020
Granny NAH Ok-boon is among
those they are questioning.

1:31:34.815 --> 1:31:36.115
Bastards.

1:31:37.276 --> 1:31:39.069
I knew they would do this.

1:31:39.570 --> 1:31:43.699
HR 121 COMFORT WOMAN
RESOLUTION TASK FORCE

1:31:43.949 --> 1:31:46.659
This is our mistake.

1:31:46.660 --> 1:31:48.704
We should've prepared everything.

1:31:49.329 --> 1:31:53.082
I'll discuss measures with
Congressman Michael Lee.

1:31:53.083 --> 1:31:54.917
Granny, what happened?

1:31:54.918 --> 1:31:58.963
Jung-shim told me to apply a dozen times.

1:31:58.964 --> 1:32:01.215
Because I didn't, it's a problem.

1:32:01.216 --> 1:32:03.050
Apply for what?

1:32:03.051 --> 1:32:09.600
The verification procedure
for comfort women.

1:32:10.184 --> 1:32:13.437
I wanted to hide it and didn't do it.

1:32:14.938 --> 1:32:18.108
So there's no proof
that I was a comfort woman.

1:32:18.942 --> 1:32:21.194
Since my country can't prove it...

1:32:21.195 --> 1:32:25.991
they say I can't testify at the hearing.

1:32:26.366 --> 1:32:28.117
That's crazy!

1:32:28.118 --> 1:32:33.582
I ruined everything
because of my damn pride.

1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:38.961
Everyone!

1:32:38.962 --> 1:32:41.965
- What's he up to?
- I need your help!

1:32:42.966 --> 1:32:45.010
Please help Granny NAH Ok-boon!

1:32:45.344 --> 1:32:47.471
Please sign the petition.

1:32:48.472 --> 1:32:51.974
Please sign the petition
to help Granny NAH Ok-boon.

1:32:51.975 --> 1:32:57.856
Could you sign to help verify
the comfort women victims?

1:32:59.983 --> 1:33:02.236
Hello. Please read this.

1:33:04.655 --> 1:33:05.988
Thank you.

1:33:05.989 --> 1:33:07.289
Hello.

1:33:11.995 --> 1:33:13.295
Please read this.

1:33:17.251 --> 1:33:18.551
Director?

1:33:19.878 --> 1:33:21.879
What in the world?

1:33:21.880 --> 1:33:23.798
Why are you here during work hours?

1:33:23.799 --> 1:33:25.099
What?

1:33:25.509 --> 1:33:28.053
It's all a part of my job.

1:33:29.012 --> 1:33:31.265
I'm not signing. Stop bothering me.

1:33:32.015 --> 1:33:34.016
But it's for your own good, sir.

1:33:34.017 --> 1:33:38.938
Verifying Granny NAH as a comfort woman
is a national issue.

1:33:38.939 --> 1:33:40.898
It'll be approved eventually.

1:33:40.899 --> 1:33:44.026
The question is, who's going to do it.

1:33:44.027 --> 1:33:47.030
Congress? Mayor of Seoul?
Minister of Gender Equality?

1:33:47.656 --> 1:33:52.077
They're all looking to resolve it
and be noticed.

1:33:52.911 --> 1:33:54.211
Director,

1:33:54.538 --> 1:34:00.042
you can pass it and receive the spotlight.

1:34:00.043 --> 1:34:01.343
Not so bad, is it?

1:34:02.212 --> 1:34:06.049
Will you pass up the chance of a lifetime?

1:34:07.968 --> 1:34:10.095
MAYOR OF SEOUL

1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:16.602
MINISTER OF GENDER EQUALITY

1:34:54.014 --> 1:34:56.265
I see you're a Level 9 official.

1:34:56.266 --> 1:34:58.142
You passed the Level 7 exam?

1:34:58.143 --> 1:34:59.443
Yes.

1:35:00.354 --> 1:35:04.106
You just have one brother in high school?

1:35:04.107 --> 1:35:06.777
Yes, I only have...

1:35:11.114 --> 1:35:12.414
No.

1:35:14.618 --> 1:35:16.119
There's one more.

1:35:17.037 --> 1:35:19.790
LEVEL 7 SECOND ROUND INTERVIEWS

1:35:23.126 --> 1:35:25.628
JAPAN REJECTS NAH OK-BOON'S
COMFORT WOMAN VERIFICATION

1:35:25.629 --> 1:35:29.007
JAPAN DEMANDS HARD EVIDENCE

1:35:48.443 --> 1:35:52.447
RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE, WASHINGTON D.C.

1:36:32.195 --> 1:36:33.495
Jung-shim...

1:36:33.947 --> 1:36:35.991
I can do this, right?

1:36:38.118 --> 1:36:39.418
Granny, here.

1:37:13.779 --> 1:37:18.909
MICHELLE VAN JANSSEN, FORCED TO COMFORT
BROTHELS BY JAPANESE IN 1942 AT AGE 21

1:37:40.430 --> 1:37:42.557
She cut off all her hair.

1:37:43.391 --> 1:37:48.396
CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL LEE, INTRODUCED
RESOLUTION HR 121 TO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

1:39:01.344 --> 1:39:02.762
Oh Michelle...

1:39:12.022 --> 1:39:14.024
Your testimony will begin.

1:39:53.688 --> 1:39:55.273
Will you testify?

1:43:39.122 --> 1:43:48.631
Japanese soldiers
carved these on me with knives.

1:43:53.636 --> 1:43:57.182
My body is covered with such scars.

1:43:59.058 --> 1:44:01.394
Every time I see these scars...

1:44:02.687 --> 1:44:08.318
the hellish memories come alive again.

1:44:11.029 --> 1:44:12.697
No evidence, you say?

1:44:13.323 --> 1:44:15.324
I'm the evidence!

1:44:15.325 --> 1:44:21.664
Michelle, here, and all survivors
are the evidence.

1:44:22.207 --> 1:44:24.959
When I suffered hell like that...

1:44:25.668 --> 1:44:30.840
I was only thirteen.

1:44:31.674 --> 1:44:32.974
Thirteen.

1:44:36.930 --> 1:44:39.098
I was unable to die.

1:44:41.684 --> 1:44:43.478
I missed my home

1:44:46.689 --> 1:44:51.444
and waited it out to see my family.

1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:40.673
Thank you. It was a moving speech.

1:48:42.550 --> 1:48:44.051
This way.

1:49:12.747 --> 1:49:14.047
This way.

1:49:28.846 --> 1:49:30.889
You crazy bastards!

1:49:30.890 --> 1:49:32.767
Min-jae! No, stop!

1:49:34.018 --> 1:49:35.853
Are you stupid?

1:49:36.521 --> 1:49:39.482
I don't need your filthy money!

1:49:40.608 --> 1:49:42.652
Acknowledge it and apologize.

1:49:42.860 --> 1:49:44.654
You shameless fools!

1:49:50.993 --> 1:49:53.286
Granny! Not that.

1:49:53.287 --> 1:49:54.587
Calm down.

1:49:56.791 --> 1:49:58.091
Calm down.

1:49:58.876 --> 1:50:01.170
You skipped work to come here?

1:50:02.004 --> 1:50:05.550
Without you, there's not much to do anyway.

1:50:07.927 --> 1:50:10.012
Thank you so much.

1:50:11.055 --> 1:50:13.057
I couldn't have spoken
without you.

1:50:13.757 --> 1:50:15.268
You were great.

1:50:18.938 --> 1:50:20.147
- Granny?
- Hmm?

1:50:20.148 --> 1:50:22.942
- Let's go to the waiting room.
- Sure.

1:50:23.693 --> 1:50:24.993
This way.

1:50:40.459 --> 1:50:44.338
He came from L.A. to see you.

1:50:59.228 --> 1:51:03.608
How'd you come here? Oh my!

1:51:18.748 --> 1:51:24.128
- I missed you, sister.
- I'm so sorry for everything.

1:51:25.087 --> 1:51:26.589
I'm so sorry.

1:51:26.839 --> 1:51:29.467
Oh, Jung-nam!

1:51:34.639 --> 1:51:37.767
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

1:51:39.226 --> 1:51:42.145
Oh, Jung-nam!

1:51:42.146 --> 1:51:45.107
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:51:50.780 --> 1:51:59.663
The 'Comfort Women' Resolution (HR 121)
was passed unanimously on July 30th, 2007.

1:51:59.664 --> 1:52:05.419
It was the comfort women's first victory
against the Japanese government.

1:52:06.128 --> 1:52:10.883
10 years later,
Japan has yet to apologize.

1:52:14.637 --> 1:52:16.055
- Hello.
- Hi.

1:52:19.433 --> 1:52:20.142
Hello.

1:52:20.143 --> 1:52:22.520
- Hello, Granny.
- Hi.

1:52:25.064 --> 1:52:27.816
I told you to put that out at night!

1:52:27.817 --> 1:52:31.654
- Okay, okay.
- Not again!

1:52:36.075 --> 1:52:38.202
Good morning.

1:52:45.167 --> 1:52:47.169
Grow up.

1:52:51.173 --> 1:52:53.425
You're going to San Francisco next week?

1:52:53.426 --> 1:52:54.218
Yup.

1:52:54.219 --> 1:52:56.846
I'm speaking at the city council.

1:52:57.972 --> 1:53:01.474
Saw the news?
Abe is talking bullshit again!

1:53:01.475 --> 1:53:03.810
But his ratings went up.

1:53:03.811 --> 1:53:05.111
Damn it!

1:53:07.189 --> 1:53:09.190
Granny.

1:53:09.191 --> 1:53:11.735
Slow down. Think of your age.

1:53:11.736 --> 1:53:14.696
The Japanese are waiting
for us to die out.

1:53:14.697 --> 1:53:17.073
So I'll live till I'm 200!

1:53:17.074 --> 1:53:18.451
Come on, Mr. Park!

1:53:18.868 --> 1:53:21.871
Granny, I'm Level 7 now.

1:53:22.204 --> 1:53:25.081
It's Chief Park.

1:53:25.082 --> 1:53:27.208
Chief... Park?

1:53:27.209 --> 1:53:30.629
Forget that. I’ll just call you Min-jae.

1:53:32.456 --> 1:53:33.906
Let's go.

1:54:01.719 --> 1:54:03.019
Yup.
