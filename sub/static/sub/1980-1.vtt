- Got a cigarette?
- I ain't got a cigarette.

01:37.306 --> 01:38.840
She's fucking stuck up.

01:38.939 --> 01:40.917
She thinks she's better
than she is, you know?

01:41.006 --> 01:43.813
Especially with her fucking British...
ha ha... accent.

01:43.906 --> 01:46.145
I mean, like... Cigarettes?

01:46.239 --> 01:51.774
And you know, if he'd just
manned the fuck up and cut...

01:51.872 --> 01:54.816
- cut her loose...
- Uh-huh.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.624
We could've enjoyed this trip, you know.

01:56.806 --> 01:58.245
Like tonight, for example, you know?

01:58.273 --> 02:01.217
We could have helped out your...
What was her name?

02:01.306 --> 02:04.772
Marie? Maria? You know...

02:04.872 --> 02:07.975
We could've had a good
time, like the four of us.

02:08.072 --> 02:10.050
What does it say?

02:10.139 --> 02:11.878
Can't you read it?

02:11.972 --> 02:13.382
It's Danish.

02:13.473 --> 02:16.383
We're in Berlin.
We speak German here.

02:16.473 --> 02:19.508
Don't you guys speak five
languages and all that shit?

02:19.806 --> 02:22.375
My boyfriend knows some Danish.

02:22.473 --> 02:24.882
We can ask him.

02:24.972 --> 02:30.144
I think we should keep your
boyfriend out of this.

03:36.505 --> 03:38.540
Why do you have to be such an asshole?

03:38.839 --> 03:40.374
Look at this place.

03:40.473 --> 03:42.451
We should be in a hostel with
dreadlocked Austrian girls.

03:42.539 --> 03:44.983
I'm in the middle here, okay?

03:47.872 --> 03:48.906
Jen?

03:55.072 --> 03:59.016
She says that the three of
us aren't working together.

03:59.106 --> 04:03.380
What? Seriously?
So I'm the fucking problem now?

04:03.472 --> 04:05.507
No, no, no. Look, I...

04:05.806 --> 04:09.012
I appreciate your openness to
Jen coming in the first place,

04:09.106 --> 04:12.447
but don't you want to do
this trip alone anyway?

04:12.539 --> 04:16.505
Alone? Why the fuck would
I want to do it alone?

04:16.805 --> 04:19.216
If I wanted to do it alone,
I would've done it 10 years ago.

04:19.305 --> 04:21.305
I would've stayed in a hostel, not a hotel.

04:21.406 --> 04:22.940
And I would've met plenty of people.

04:23.039 --> 04:24.983
And by people, I mean fucking hot girls.

04:25.072 --> 04:26.175
But that wasn't the plan.

04:26.273 --> 04:28.273
The plan was to do this together.

04:28.373 --> 04:30.509
You gotta put yourself in my position.

04:30.806 --> 04:31.840
What would you do?

04:31.939 --> 04:34.076
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

04:34.173 --> 04:35.891
No, I'm not putting myself in your position

04:35.906 --> 04:37.350
'cause I would never have
brought a girlfriend

04:37.438 --> 04:38.472
on a guys' trip.

04:38.572 --> 04:39.948
Why do you listen to her anyway?

04:40.039 --> 04:41.349
I mean, you broke up with her already.

04:41.438 --> 04:44.439
No, we broke up last
Christmas for three days.

04:44.539 --> 04:46.448
Do you remember Jason with Penny

04:46.539 --> 04:48.517
and all that back-and-forth
back-and-forth shit

04:48.806 --> 04:49.737
and they still got married?

04:49.839 --> 04:51.283
How did that turn out?

04:51.373 --> 04:54.146
You're comparing Jen and me
to Penny and anal beads?

04:54.239 --> 04:56.239
It's not the beads.
It's what the beads represent.

05:14.206 --> 05:16.911
Can I help you?

05:17.006 --> 05:18.245
I need a map.

05:31.139 --> 05:34.345
Look at the size of the bed.

05:34.438 --> 05:37.280
I'm ready and waiting.
It's bouncy, eh?

05:37.372 --> 05:38.907
- That's sexy.
- Yeah!

05:39.006 --> 05:41.041
That is really fucking sexy.

05:41.139 --> 05:42.912
I know it's sexy.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.312
There's a bar next door.

06:14.405 --> 06:17.179
I was gonna grab a beer.
You wanna come?

06:21.472 --> 06:23.347
Go away!

06:35.372 --> 06:37.248
You guys took long enough.

06:37.338 --> 06:39.180
Jeremy's not coming.

06:43.338 --> 06:47.078
So are you tracking down
your family tomorrow?

06:47.173 --> 06:49.151
That's why we're here, isn't it?

06:49.239 --> 06:51.012
I want to apologize.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.845
I honestly thought it would be okay,

06:53.939 --> 06:56.940
me coming on this trip, but...

06:57.039 --> 06:59.244
But what?

07:00.972 --> 07:02.540
It was obviously a bad idea.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.475
Yeah.

07:04.572 --> 07:06.982
I agree. This was a guys' trip.

07:07.072 --> 07:11.277
You have no idea how lucky you
are to have Jeremy as a friend.

07:11.372 --> 07:13.248
You think this is funny?

07:13.338 --> 07:15.543
We have love.
We have each other.

07:15.839 --> 07:16.976
I'm just worried because I think

07:17.072 --> 07:18.845
you're gonna be so fucking alone.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.246
- Shut up!
- Excuse me?

07:20.338 --> 07:23.249
What the fuck do you want from me?

07:23.338 --> 07:24.543
This was a mistake.

07:24.839 --> 07:26.407
Sit.

07:26.505 --> 07:29.109
Please.

07:29.206 --> 07:32.376
There's something you and
me need to acknowledge.

07:32.472 --> 07:34.212
And what's that?

07:36.006 --> 07:40.075
The night you met Jeremy, you
wanted to fuck me first.

07:40.173 --> 07:43.049
And then Prague?

07:43.139 --> 07:46.776
Now, I know you were drunk, but still...

07:51.505 --> 07:57.450
You are the most pathetic
guy I have ever met.

08:00.405 --> 08:03.542
Even now...
I bet you wouldn't mind

08:03.839 --> 08:07.373
just a little quickie in the bathroom.

08:35.938 --> 08:37.847
All right.

08:37.938 --> 08:39.211
Whoa!

08:39.304 --> 08:41.977
All right!

08:42.072 --> 08:43.481
Oh, yeah!

08:43.572 --> 08:44.777
Okay?

08:44.872 --> 08:46.816
Just, uh, let's make some noise.

08:46.906 --> 08:49.509
- Like what?
- Just moan loud.

08:49.806 --> 08:51.943
- Ohh!
- Yeah, that's right.

08:52.039 --> 08:53.313
- I need you to moan loud.
- Oh, yeah!

08:53.405 --> 08:55.145
Yeah, that's right.
Louder, like this.

08:55.238 --> 08:58.409
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

08:58.505 --> 09:00.142
Come on, you can do it, that's it.

09:00.238 --> 09:02.216
Oh, yeah! Ohh!

09:02.305 --> 09:05.306
- All right.
- Okay. Okay!

09:06.972 --> 09:09.245
Mmm!

09:09.338 --> 09:12.078
Oh! Oh, yeah!

09:12.172 --> 09:14.480
Oh, shit, yeah!

09:14.572 --> 09:17.277
All right!

09:17.372 --> 09:17.872
Oh!

09:22.039 --> 09:24.277
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

09:24.372 --> 09:25.941
Yeah!

09:47.839 --> 09:49.282
Hey! What the fuck?

09:49.372 --> 09:52.248
We're going to London to get married.

09:52.338 --> 09:55.214
Jeremy proposed last night.

09:55.305 --> 09:57.408
He wrote you a note.
It's all in there.

09:59.338 --> 10:01.044
Where is he?

10:01.138 --> 10:02.810
I'm sorry it couldn't work out.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.406
Look, I wanna talk to him.

10:07.939 --> 10:09.314
Just let us go.

10:18.939 --> 10:21.974
You wanna get some breakfast?

10:22.072 --> 10:23.413
I have to go to work.

10:23.505 --> 10:26.312
Call in sick.

10:59.472 --> 11:02.348
Fucking grammar, retard.

11:34.005 --> 11:35.074
You dropped this.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.411
You keep it.

11:39.972 --> 11:43.006
Can you help me with this, please?

11:43.105 --> 11:45.811
- You speak Danish, right?
- Yeah.

11:45.906 --> 11:49.008
Yeah, right.
What does this say?

11:49.105 --> 11:50.777
Fuck!

11:50.872 --> 11:52.247
- Oh, shit. The address!
- Sorry!

11:52.338 --> 11:54.441
No, no, read it.
What's the address?

11:54.539 --> 11:56.448
- You didn't make a copy?
- Idiot!

11:59.138 --> 12:00.411
What? English!

12:00.505 --> 12:02.346
I said it was your fault.

12:02.438 --> 12:04.382
No. The truth is you suck at your job.

12:04.472 --> 12:06.108
- This isn't even my job.
- Good!

12:06.205 --> 12:07.842
Don't make a career out of it.

12:07.939 --> 12:09.541
I'm not going to tell you the address.

12:09.839 --> 12:12.817
Really? You read it?

12:12.906 --> 12:14.144
You didn't read it.

12:14.238 --> 12:17.045
ForhÂbningsholms Alle, number 49.

12:17.138 --> 12:20.810
Wait. Can you write that down?
Where is it on the map?

12:32.405 --> 12:34.349
It's here.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.783
You're welcome.

12:51.005 --> 12:53.847
Hi. Hey, can you...

12:53.938 --> 12:55.938
Do you know where I am on this?

12:57.806 --> 12:59.477
All right, which way is north?

12:59.572 --> 13:02.175
Got it. It's that way, right?

13:02.272 --> 13:04.409
Stroger, Stroger, Stroger.

13:04.505 --> 13:06.540
Stroger?

13:10.372 --> 13:12.008
Fuck off, man.

13:53.806 --> 13:55.215
Cool hostel, huh?

13:56.806 --> 13:59.215
Yeah.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.010
Do you know where this address is?

14:01.105 --> 14:02.549
I've been looking all day.

14:02.839 --> 14:05.180
Oh, I'm not from here.

14:05.272 --> 14:06.477
Sorry.

14:06.572 --> 14:08.811
Right. Me neither.

14:08.905 --> 14:09.974
Where you from?

14:10.071 --> 14:11.946
Canada. You?

14:12.038 --> 14:13.072
New York.

14:13.172 --> 14:14.911
Oh, me too.

14:15.005 --> 14:18.006
But you just said you're from Canada.

14:18.105 --> 14:20.844
Isn't that what we're
supposed to tell people?

14:20.938 --> 14:23.280
I think it's okay to be American again.

14:23.372 --> 14:24.349
- Okay.
- Shh.

14:26.338 --> 14:29.248
So where in New York are you from?

14:29.338 --> 14:30.475
Jersey.

14:30.572 --> 14:32.015
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.208
Jersey.

14:33.305 --> 14:36.545
- What are you doing here?
- Um...

14:36.838 --> 14:40.408
I have family here.
I'm looking for them.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.210
- Oh!
- What about you?

14:43.305 --> 14:46.283
I'm here with a friend
doing like a tour thing.

14:46.372 --> 14:47.509
Oh.

14:47.806 --> 14:49.976
So what should I do?

14:50.071 --> 14:51.481
Where should I go?

14:51.572 --> 14:54.049
There's a club called Culture Box.

14:54.138 --> 14:56.116
- It's awesome.
- A club.

14:56.205 --> 14:58.114
Yeah, like a nightclub.

14:58.205 --> 15:00.774
- Wow.
- Oh, here's my friend.

15:02.138 --> 15:04.047
Is that where you're going tonight?

15:04.138 --> 15:06.047
Um...

15:06.138 --> 15:10.105
No. Our bus leaves for
Berlin in like two hours.

15:10.205 --> 15:11.410
Sucks.

15:11.505 --> 15:13.846
Really? I heard Berlin's cool.

15:13.938 --> 15:16.212
I mean it sucks that you are leaving.

15:16.305 --> 15:17.339
Well, see ya!

15:27.405 --> 15:28.542
What can I help you with?

15:28.838 --> 15:31.248
Just the bill for that, please, thanks.

15:31.338 --> 15:33.872
Are you here alone?

15:36.838 --> 15:39.544
You know, it is when you're all alone,

15:39.838 --> 15:43.305
with no friends, no family
to lean on, that...

15:43.405 --> 15:47.406
that you find out if you
are the kind of person

15:47.505 --> 15:51.074
that one can lean on.

15:52.372 --> 15:53.475
Great.

15:53.572 --> 15:55.947
Yes, yes, it is great.

15:59.138 --> 16:01.275
Listen...

16:01.372 --> 16:04.975
lam going to take a nap.

16:05.071 --> 16:07.481
Um...

16:07.572 --> 16:10.209
You care to lean on me?

16:12.205 --> 16:14.080
Jer!

16:14.172 --> 16:16.343
Fucking douche.

16:16.438 --> 16:19.904
What's going on? Seriously.

16:20.005 --> 16:22.778
Let's talk about this, all right?

16:22.871 --> 16:24.849
That's bullshit.

16:24.938 --> 16:27.007
She sucks, all right?
And not in a good way.

16:27.105 --> 16:29.049
We both know it, okay?

16:29.138 --> 16:31.775
Just call me.

16:42.438 --> 16:44.382
Not cool, you know.

16:44.472 --> 16:46.972
That place you marked
on my map was way off.

16:47.071 --> 16:48.481
No, it wasn't.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.913
I looked around all day.
I know I'm not from here,

16:51.005 --> 16:52.506
but I asked people and everything.

16:52.805 --> 16:54.249
So where are you from?

16:54.338 --> 16:56.282
Canada.

16:56.372 --> 16:58.849
They kill baby seals there.

17:01.205 --> 17:03.308
I'm not really from Canada.

17:03.405 --> 17:06.178
Actually, I'm from Denmark, kind of.

17:06.271 --> 17:09.443
My father was born here.

17:09.539 --> 17:12.483
That address you destroyed
was my grandfather's.

17:12.571 --> 17:15.550
Finding him is the only
reason I'm in this city.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.137
I'm sorry I destroyed your paper.

17:20.238 --> 17:23.011
It was an accident.

17:23.105 --> 17:26.549
Look, I really need to find him.
Are you sure you read it right?

17:29.305 --> 17:32.771
The address was right.

17:32.871 --> 17:37.282
Maybe I accidentally
circled the wrong spot.

17:37.372 --> 17:40.111
Don't fuck with me.

17:40.205 --> 17:41.478
Look, I already told you.

17:41.572 --> 17:44.140
ForhÂbningsholms Alle, number 49.

17:46.539 --> 17:48.846
I can show you where it is, if you want.

17:48.938 --> 17:50.779
It's on my way home.

17:50.871 --> 17:53.349
But I'm going right now.

17:53.438 --> 17:55.473
You need a bike.

17:55.572 --> 17:58.243
Where am I gonna get a bike?

17:58.338 --> 17:59.838
20 kroner.

18:05.472 --> 18:07.779
Fucking socialists.

18:10.238 --> 18:12.113
It's in here.

18:20.071 --> 18:23.106
Okay, um... what is the name?

18:23.205 --> 18:24.478
Uh, Rasmussen.

18:24.572 --> 18:27.015
Rasmussen. Yeah. It's here.

18:41.472 --> 18:44.075
First floor, door on the right side.

18:46.105 --> 18:49.447
Could you come in with me, please?

19:05.238 --> 19:08.216
Don't eat that shit, man.
It has been there for years.

19:16.438 --> 19:18.507
This... This letter is for you.

19:18.805 --> 19:21.249
It's from my father.

19:25.005 --> 19:26.278
Ah.

19:42.805 --> 19:44.181
He's your father's uncle.

19:56.905 --> 20:00.247
Do... Do you know where my grandfather is?

20:19.438 --> 20:22.109
What? What's he saying?

20:22.205 --> 20:23.944
Your grandfather was a Nazi.

20:26.071 --> 20:28.140
What the fuck are you talking about?

20:33.871 --> 20:36.076
Good. You deserved that.

20:36.172 --> 20:38.979
What? I'm just translating
for that demented fuck.

20:50.805 --> 20:52.244
They took the pictures and sent them

20:52.272 --> 20:55.182
to your grandfather in jail.

21:15.905 --> 21:18.247
What? What's he saying?

21:18.338 --> 21:20.316
They beat your grandmother
for being with a Nazi.

21:20.405 --> 21:23.814
They shaved her head and spit in her face.

21:57.938 --> 21:59.779
What? What's he saying?

22:02.105 --> 22:04.105
You can keep them.

22:15.871 --> 22:18.281
Are you okay?

22:18.371 --> 22:20.440
Why wouldn't I be?

22:24.305 --> 22:27.510
Uh, how would I find my
grandfather if he's alive?

22:27.805 --> 22:30.783
I don't know. Google?

22:33.371 --> 22:35.281
Wait. Where you going?

22:35.371 --> 22:36.542
Home.

22:36.838 --> 22:38.873
Thank you!

23:25.571 --> 23:28.106
You're still here.

23:35.038 --> 23:37.107
He's smiling.

23:37.205 --> 23:38.443
Happy.-

23:41.805 --> 23:44.806
I never saw him smile in my entire life.

23:47.172 --> 23:50.308
So your father never told you
anything about your grandfather?

23:50.404 --> 23:51.814
No.

23:51.905 --> 23:54.213
Can you ask him?

23:54.304 --> 23:57.078
He died last year.

23:57.172 --> 23:59.150
I never met my real father.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.216
Left before I was born.

24:01.304 --> 24:04.441
My father left when I was 14.

24:04.538 --> 24:08.539
When he died last year, alone,
I was going through his things,

24:08.838 --> 24:11.475
and I found this letter he never sent.

24:11.571 --> 24:13.549
He wrote it when he was eight.

24:13.838 --> 24:15.543
What does it say?

24:15.838 --> 24:17.077
I don't know.

24:17.172 --> 24:18.877
You tell me.

24:18.971 --> 24:21.108
- You haven't read it yet?
- No.

24:32.571 --> 24:35.344
It's very nice.

24:35.437 --> 24:41.007
Um, it says that he's missing Copenhagen,

24:41.105 --> 24:46.276
and that it will always be his home.

24:46.371 --> 24:49.179
And that when he gets a family,

24:49.271 --> 24:52.841
he wants them to see what made him smile.

24:58.271 --> 25:01.442
I know this. It's Tivoli.

25:03.504 --> 25:05.413
- Mark it on the map.
- Why?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.345
Just do it.

25:07.437 --> 25:08.779
All right.

25:08.871 --> 25:11.542
Where's Tivoli on the map?

25:11.838 --> 25:15.044
It's where it says "Tivoli."

25:15.138 --> 25:17.809
Uh...

25:17.905 --> 25:20.076
The little mermaid...

25:21.504 --> 25:23.277
What are you doing?

25:23.371 --> 25:25.781
Have to see what made him smile.

25:25.871 --> 25:28.815
Let's go. Tivoli first.

25:28.905 --> 25:30.905
Hey, Jer, it's me.

25:31.005 --> 25:32.005
Fuck you.

25:32.105 --> 25:33.980
I didn't mean that.

25:34.071 --> 25:37.913
Look, if you get this, can
you call me at, um...

25:38.005 --> 25:38.548
45-87...

25:43.071 --> 25:45.878
89-39.

25:45.971 --> 25:47.915
All right, fuck you.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.074
I forgive you.
Seriously, call me, man.

25:50.171 --> 25:51.240
All right.

25:51.337 --> 25:53.337
Okay, we have to go over here.

25:53.437 --> 25:55.506
Castle's over here.

25:58.271 --> 26:02.272
Okay, go over there and see what he saw.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.941
What do you see?

26:09.038 --> 26:10.447
A bunch of annoying kids.

26:10.538 --> 26:13.107
Okay, I'm going to take the picture now.

26:13.204 --> 26:15.808
You one of those people?

26:15.905 --> 26:18.781
Do you mean this?

26:18.871 --> 26:20.371
It's cool.

26:22.905 --> 26:24.849
Okay, smile like your father.

26:28.271 --> 26:29.340
Is this what we're gonna do all day?

26:29.437 --> 26:31.006
You don't like Tivoli?

26:31.104 --> 26:33.844
It's boring. It's for kids.

26:33.938 --> 26:37.108
I can show you Sweden if you want.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.477
That's not boring.

26:38.571 --> 26:41.412
Shit. I need to get off this right now.

26:41.504 --> 26:44.345
Oh, God. Oh, God.

26:44.437 --> 26:47.415
- Look, that's Sweden.
- What?

26:47.504 --> 26:50.812
I told you I would show you Sweden.
That's Sweden.

26:50.905 --> 26:53.382
Sweden is on the other side of the water.

26:53.471 --> 26:55.380
I don't wanna open my eyes.

26:55.471 --> 26:58.312
You can't have your eyes closed.

26:58.404 --> 27:00.541
Open them.

27:00.838 --> 27:02.474
Oh! I hate you.

27:02.571 --> 27:03.913
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

27:04.005 --> 27:06.005
What's happening? Oh, fuck.

27:06.104 --> 27:07.514
Oh, fuck. Okay.

27:07.805 --> 27:09.976
- It's beautiful, right?
- Sure.

27:10.070 --> 27:12.241
- That bridge goes to Sweden.
- What's happening?

27:12.337 --> 27:14.508
What was that? Has it stopped?

27:17.171 --> 27:19.047
Jesus! Fuck yeah!

27:19.137 --> 27:22.014
Oh, God! Oh, no, no, no.

27:22.104 --> 27:24.844
Oh, make it stop!

27:24.938 --> 27:27.438
Whoo! Oh, God.

27:27.538 --> 27:29.345
That was fun, right?

27:29.437 --> 27:30.972
Mange tak.

27:33.437 --> 27:34.813
What else?

27:34.905 --> 27:37.109
How do you say, "What's your name?"

27:45.437 --> 27:46.540
Yeah, perfect.

28:02.271 --> 28:05.272
Something's written here. Look.

28:05.371 --> 28:07.940
It's very faded though.

28:09.504 --> 28:12.004
I think this is where your father was born.

28:12.104 --> 28:13.343
- What?
- It's on Vaernademsvej.

28:13.371 --> 28:16.144
- Let me see.
- I know where it is.

28:16.237 --> 28:19.340
Hey, we can go and check if your
grandfather still lives there.

28:19.437 --> 28:21.881
Chances of that are zero.

28:21.971 --> 28:23.846
Yeah, but we can check.
Maybe he does.

28:23.938 --> 28:26.779
Then you can give him the letter.

28:37.437 --> 28:39.210
Let's... Let's go.

28:39.304 --> 28:40.509
Sit down.

28:42.871 --> 28:44.405
What are you doing?

28:48.004 --> 28:49.812
Wh-Where are you going?

28:49.905 --> 28:51.780
- Let's try this.
- What?

28:53.437 --> 28:55.779
Go to the door.

28:57.905 --> 28:59.507
You know...

28:59.805 --> 29:02.009
this would be a lot more fun if
you were the other way around.

29:02.104 --> 29:04.844
Got it.

29:04.938 --> 29:06.438
Look.

29:11.070 --> 29:12.275
What are you...

29:13.871 --> 29:15.109
Are you insane?

29:28.037 --> 29:30.174
These people are not related to me.

29:33.337 --> 29:35.008
- Don't be a racist.
- I'm out of here.

29:35.104 --> 29:37.013
No, wait.

29:37.104 --> 29:41.139
I think this is where the stove was.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.510
Who's Daniel?

29:44.037 --> 29:45.242
That was my father's name.

29:45.337 --> 29:47.508
- Was his last name Vinter?
- No.

29:47.805 --> 29:48.782
Okay.

29:51.271 --> 29:53.476
That's my father's birthday.

29:53.571 --> 29:55.242
Whoa.

30:08.337 --> 30:10.212
Okay, all right.

30:10.304 --> 30:11.873
Let's go right now.

30:11.970 --> 30:13.380
No! We need to take a picture.

30:13.471 --> 30:15.039
Just stand where he is in the photo.

30:15.137 --> 30:16.274
No!

30:16.371 --> 30:18.212
I'm not leaving without the photo,

30:18.304 --> 30:23.305
so if you want me to get
caught, you can just go.

30:24.904 --> 30:26.439
All right, come on.

30:30.237 --> 30:31.772
Okay, smile.

30:35.371 --> 30:37.542
- That was stupid.
- You're boring.

30:37.838 --> 30:39.144
We broke into someone's place.

30:39.237 --> 30:41.078
We didn't break anything.

30:42.904 --> 30:46.110
You can apologize if you want to.

30:47.805 --> 30:49.009
Hi.

30:49.104 --> 30:50.446
- Hi.
- Hi, hi.

30:52.805 --> 30:55.975
Okay, so your father was born Vinter.

30:56.070 --> 30:58.810
Vinter wasn't my father's last name, okay?

30:58.904 --> 31:00.214
But then it must be your grandfather's.

31:00.237 --> 31:01.839
You know, we can actually find out.

31:01.937 --> 31:05.211
My uncle, he works at
the People's Registry.

31:05.304 --> 31:06.805
He can look it up.

31:06.904 --> 31:08.439
Then we can find your grandfather,

31:08.538 --> 31:11.845
and you can give him the letter.

31:11.937 --> 31:14.176
All right. All right.

31:14.271 --> 31:16.249
Good, let's go.

31:19.137 --> 31:21.172
Oh, that's hard. Ow!

31:21.271 --> 31:23.942
Fuck! That does it.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

31:24.037 --> 31:27.243
Swap... Stop, stop.
Switch bikes.

31:27.337 --> 31:29.474
- Ow!
- Ha ha! See?

31:33.237 --> 31:35.772
I'd say...

31:37.837 --> 31:41.145
I don't think I've ever been in love.

31:41.237 --> 31:44.010
I said it. There you go.

31:44.104 --> 31:45.809
I said it.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.109
I said it!

31:48.204 --> 31:50.045
Of course you've been in love.

31:57.271 --> 31:58.510
Fuck.

31:58.804 --> 32:00.441
What? What is it?

32:00.538 --> 32:02.379
My chain fell off.

32:08.337 --> 32:09.814
Hold on.

32:25.337 --> 32:27.814
Got it!

32:27.904 --> 32:32.939
Then the music started, and then I fainted.

32:33.037 --> 32:36.913
I don't know why.
Really, I wasn't nervous.

32:37.004 --> 32:38.539
And you know...

32:40.037 --> 32:41.310
Well, like... voom!

32:41.404 --> 32:43.040
Yeah, and...

32:43.137 --> 32:44.842
Like smack!

32:44.937 --> 32:47.915
Yeah, on the stomach, right?
Like down.

32:48.004 --> 32:50.278
And you know, I don't know if you know it,

32:50.371 --> 32:53.780
but when you faint,

32:53.870 --> 32:57.246
your body like stops working.

32:57.337 --> 32:58.871
No, I've seen a lot of girls faint.

32:58.970 --> 33:00.346
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.880
So...

33:02.970 --> 33:06.039
I shit my pants.

33:06.137 --> 33:07.842
And everyone saw it.

33:07.937 --> 33:10.415
No, wait, wait. I gotta stop.

33:10.504 --> 33:14.312
You literally evacuated your bowels?

33:14.404 --> 33:15.438
Yeah.

33:21.504 --> 33:23.140
- Hello?
- Hi.

33:40.404 --> 33:44.848
Okay, he's on a break,
but he'll be back soon.

33:44.937 --> 33:46.972
Do you want me to show you
something really cool?

33:50.970 --> 33:52.039
Come.

33:53.504 --> 33:55.913
Wait. Don't we have to pay?

33:56.004 --> 33:58.175
No. Art is for the people.

34:07.504 --> 34:08.981
Come.

34:10.404 --> 34:12.541
How old are you?

34:15.036 --> 34:20.072
My real age is actually 345.

34:20.170 --> 34:22.409
I'm just trapped in this young body.

34:22.504 --> 34:24.913
Right.

34:25.004 --> 34:27.175
I'm a vampire.

34:27.271 --> 34:32.079
I feed off rats and tourists.

34:32.170 --> 34:35.445
Well, you can start by sucking my neck

34:35.538 --> 34:39.311
before moving on to, uh...

34:56.804 --> 35:00.907
If I was a vampire, you'd be dead.

35:12.870 --> 35:14.246
Look.

35:15.937 --> 35:17.415
All right.

35:19.304 --> 35:21.145
I love this.

35:27.404 --> 35:29.177
Venus.

35:29.271 --> 35:30.942
She's beautiful.

35:32.237 --> 35:33.839
A little short.

35:33.937 --> 35:35.472
Nice tits.

35:41.004 --> 35:43.107
We're almost there.

35:44.137 --> 35:45.206
All right.

35:53.137 --> 35:55.115
What do you think?

36:01.570 --> 36:03.946
How is that possible?

36:04.037 --> 36:05.481
I told you. I'm a vampire.

36:05.570 --> 36:08.878
No, you said you were 345.

36:08.970 --> 36:13.108
Seriously, this is thousands of years old.

36:13.204 --> 36:16.341
Well, I lied about my age.

36:21.237 --> 36:24.340
I never showed this to anyone before.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.044
Close your eyes.

36:30.104 --> 36:31.547
Close them.

37:23.137 --> 37:24.046
Okay.

37:24.137 --> 37:25.842
Yeah, bye-bye.

37:25.937 --> 37:27.006
Bye.

37:28.470 --> 37:30.278
My uncle's back.

37:30.371 --> 37:32.507
So, um, Eva tells me

37:32.804 --> 37:35.373
that you are her friend's
cousin from America.

37:35.470 --> 37:37.142
- Canada, actually.
- Yeah.

37:37.237 --> 37:38.271
Toronto.

37:38.371 --> 37:40.541
Canada is not America.

37:40.837 --> 37:42.837
Right. North America, I guess.

37:42.937 --> 37:45.142
Mexico is America then, as well.

37:46.837 --> 37:52.509
Anyways, there were 165
children born in Denmark

37:52.804 --> 37:55.305
on January 15, 1944.

37:55.404 --> 37:59.041
Is any of them called Daniel Rasmussen?

37:59.137 --> 38:02.081
No, there's no record
of a Daniel Rasmussen.

38:02.171 --> 38:05.546
What about Daniel Vinter?

38:05.837 --> 38:07.247
- Vinter?
- Yeah.

38:07.337 --> 38:09.246
Yeah, but you needed Rasmussen.

38:09.337 --> 38:10.507
Rasmussen, right, yeah.

38:10.804 --> 38:12.440
First Rasmussen, then Vinter.

38:22.503 --> 38:24.412
Vinter.

38:24.503 --> 38:27.141
Daniel Vinter.

38:27.237 --> 38:30.181
Yes, there is a Daniel
Vinter born that day.

38:30.271 --> 38:32.306
Is there any way to check that
if that's the same Daniel,

38:32.403 --> 38:33.472
that's the same person?

38:33.570 --> 38:35.548
Listen, I...

38:35.837 --> 38:38.213
This can only tell the person's name,

38:38.304 --> 38:41.111
but cannot tell the
relationships between them.

38:41.204 --> 38:44.080
This is not a wizard.
This is a database system.

38:44.171 --> 38:46.080
If I know the name of your grandfather...

38:46.171 --> 38:48.080
- Okay, yeah, all right.
- Do you know him?

38:48.171 --> 38:50.274
- No.
- No. Then...

38:50.370 --> 38:53.837
if I knew his name, then I could find him.

38:57.570 --> 38:59.014
How was your praktik?

38:59.104 --> 39:02.014
It was fun.
Morten got me a job at a hotel.

39:02.104 --> 39:04.104
Well, hotel is not a bad place to work.

39:04.204 --> 39:05.442
No.

39:07.037 --> 39:09.015
But you could do better.

39:11.470 --> 39:14.005
- We can find your grandfather.
- What?

39:14.104 --> 39:15.207
Yeah, look.

39:15.304 --> 39:17.304
There is a year in the photo.

39:17.403 --> 39:18.506
Ow!

39:18.804 --> 39:19.941
What? What's the matter?

39:22.304 --> 39:24.440
- You got a splinter.
- No.

39:24.537 --> 39:27.515
Here. You got tweezers?

39:28.537 --> 39:30.243
- Ow!
- Sorry.

39:33.403 --> 39:36.177
That was a dick thing for your
uncle to say about your job.

39:36.271 --> 39:37.475
What?

39:37.570 --> 39:39.310
You can do better than a hotel?

39:39.403 --> 39:41.779
My uncle is very nice.

39:41.870 --> 39:43.973
Still, don't listen to him.

39:44.070 --> 39:48.014
You want to work in a
hotel, work in a hotel.

39:48.104 --> 39:52.071
I don't work in a hotel.

39:52.171 --> 39:53.341
It's my praktik.

39:53.436 --> 39:56.278
It's like my internship.

39:56.370 --> 39:57.905
What internship?

39:58.004 --> 39:59.413
Um...

39:59.503 --> 40:01.845
Everyone does one in school.

40:01.937 --> 40:04.176
You're in college?

40:04.271 --> 40:06.771
" Ow!"

40:06.870 --> 40:09.178
Big one.

40:09.271 --> 40:10.543
You okay?

40:11.570 --> 40:12.877
Um...

40:14.503 --> 40:18.345
I'm in... I'm in ground school.

40:18.436 --> 40:22.972
Next year I am going to high school.

40:25.804 --> 40:28.009
How old are you?

40:29.237 --> 40:30.270
I'm 14.

40:30.370 --> 40:32.905
No, you're not.

40:33.004 --> 40:34.481
Yes, I am.

40:34.570 --> 40:36.411
That's bullshit.

40:36.503 --> 40:38.243
No, it's not. What do you mean?

40:38.336 --> 40:39.279
Why?

40:39.370 --> 40:41.212
What why?

40:41.303 --> 40:43.213
That's great.

40:43.303 --> 40:44.975
That's just great.

40:49.303 --> 40:51.179
I'm 15 soon.

40:56.303 --> 40:58.111
You okay?

41:13.403 --> 41:15.381
What are you doing?

41:22.336 --> 41:24.439
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong?

41:24.537 --> 41:26.913
You know, I came here to this stupid city,

41:27.004 --> 41:29.845
and my best friend ditches
me to get married.

41:29.937 --> 41:32.778
I visit the only family I
have on this entire planet,

41:32.870 --> 41:34.973
and I find out that my
grandfather is a Nazi.

41:37.336 --> 41:39.336
And you're 14.

41:39.436 --> 41:41.514
If you don't want to go to
the places in the photos,

41:41.804 --> 41:43.304
that's fine,

41:43.403 --> 41:45.972
but you still have to
find your grandfather.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.877
How do we do that?

41:47.970 --> 41:50.039
We just need the baptism records,

41:50.137 --> 41:53.239
then we can find the name of the parents.

41:53.336 --> 41:56.076
I did a project in school
last year about family trees,

41:56.171 --> 41:58.842
and I could go 200 years back.

41:58.937 --> 42:02.278
We just need to find the church.

42:04.804 --> 42:08.213
Family tree project in school?

42:08.303 --> 42:09.906
Jesus Christ.

42:16.037 --> 42:18.310
Okay, so we just need to find the church,

42:18.403 --> 42:20.176
then we can go get the records.

42:23.303 --> 42:25.941
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

42:30.937 --> 42:32.881
You think she's pretty?

42:32.970 --> 42:34.039
Yeah.

42:36.236 --> 42:39.214
Prettier than me?

42:39.303 --> 42:41.009
No.

42:41.104 --> 42:42.877
Apparently you're 14.

42:42.970 --> 42:45.107
She's old and still has it.

42:45.203 --> 42:47.408
Who knows where you'll end up.

42:49.403 --> 42:52.142
You're not that nice, you know?

42:52.236 --> 42:54.145
How the fuck can you be 14?

42:54.236 --> 42:55.475
Are these the baptism records?

42:55.570 --> 42:57.548
No. Um...

42:57.837 --> 42:59.974
Your father's uncle,

43:00.070 --> 43:02.843
he told us that this is where
your father was baptized,

43:02.937 --> 43:04.846
and this church was built in 1887,

43:04.937 --> 43:09.006
so I'm looking for a church built in 1887.

43:12.570 --> 43:14.241
Here.

43:14.336 --> 43:15.507
I found it.

43:26.503 --> 43:30.538
They're making a copy of
all the records from 1944.

43:30.837 --> 43:32.473
Good.

43:32.570 --> 43:34.377
Yeah.

43:35.837 --> 43:37.473
What a way to go.

43:37.570 --> 43:39.946
It's not the worst way to die.

43:40.037 --> 43:43.071
What's the worst way to die then?

43:43.170 --> 43:45.478
I think it's sharks.

43:45.570 --> 43:48.048
You're afraid of sharks?

43:48.136 --> 43:50.136
Yeah, they eat you.

43:50.236 --> 43:54.339
Imagine to be an animal that can get eaten.

43:54.436 --> 43:56.345
Must be so scary.

43:56.436 --> 43:59.471
Animals aren't aware of death.

43:59.570 --> 44:02.275
That's what separates us from them.

44:02.370 --> 44:03.814
And the thumbs.

44:03.904 --> 44:05.279
And marriage.

44:05.370 --> 44:07.109
Yeah.

44:07.203 --> 44:09.545
Animals just fuck.

44:13.570 --> 44:15.878
Don't look at me like that.

44:26.837 --> 44:27.940
Thank you, Father.

44:28.036 --> 44:30.015
He's not your father.

44:31.136 --> 44:32.876
- We need a computer.
- What?

44:32.970 --> 44:35.470
We need a computer.

44:35.570 --> 44:37.775
All right, um...

44:37.870 --> 44:40.905
There's one in my hotel room.
That could work.

44:43.503 --> 44:45.412
What happened to your computer?

44:45.503 --> 44:47.344
Pissed me off.

44:53.036 --> 44:54.275
Look.

44:54.370 --> 44:55.473
Come.

44:55.570 --> 44:56.809
Look.

45:02.837 --> 45:04.246
Okay.

45:04.336 --> 45:07.314
Your father was baptized Daniel Vinter.

45:07.403 --> 45:10.438
Mother, Marie Rasmussen,
and father Thomas Vinter.

45:11.470 --> 45:16.244
Born January 15, 1944.

45:16.336 --> 45:19.212
Was your grandmother's name Marie?

45:19.303 --> 45:21.076
Yeah.

45:21.170 --> 45:24.774
Okay, that means that your
grandfather's name...

45:24.870 --> 45:26.506
was Thomas, right?

45:26.804 --> 45:27.804
Right.

45:27.904 --> 45:30.472
Okay. And look.

45:32.270 --> 45:35.771
Thomas Vinter is still alive,
and he lives in Skagen.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.339
So this is your grandfather.

45:41.937 --> 45:43.971
You found your grandfather.

45:46.203 --> 45:48.203
- Can we go there?
- Yeah.

45:48.303 --> 45:50.406
It's in the other end of the country,

45:50.503 --> 45:52.412
but we can go there tomorrow,

45:52.503 --> 45:56.072
and you can give him the letter.

45:56.170 --> 45:59.171
Do you want to go and see
these places before?

46:01.003 --> 46:03.038
What's that?

46:03.136 --> 46:04.977
It's a mosquito bite.

46:09.804 --> 46:10.940
- Activate!
- Don't!

46:13.503 --> 46:15.481
Be serious.

46:15.570 --> 46:17.945
Why the fuck is this so important to you?

46:18.036 --> 46:22.071
I don't have any pictures of my father.

46:22.170 --> 46:24.478
I'm sorry.

46:24.570 --> 46:27.047
I never wanted to see what
made my father smile.

46:27.136 --> 46:28.977
I just wanted...

46:31.203 --> 46:33.807
One time my father took a picture,

46:33.903 --> 46:37.006
and I crossed my arms just like this.

46:37.103 --> 46:40.809
He said, "I know what that means."

46:40.903 --> 46:42.472
So what does it mean?

46:42.570 --> 46:45.945
I was saying...

46:46.036 --> 46:48.878
"I don't need you.

46:48.969 --> 46:50.947
I can take care of myself."

46:51.036 --> 46:56.037
I was crossing my heart or... whatever.

46:58.303 --> 47:01.144
I need to tell you something.

47:04.170 --> 47:06.205
I lied.

47:06.303 --> 47:08.974
You're not 14. I knew it!

47:09.069 --> 47:10.910
Why the hell would you say that you were?

47:11.003 --> 47:14.072
No, I'm 14. That's not it.

47:15.936 --> 47:17.312
You made it itchy.

47:17.403 --> 47:19.142
Stop it.
What did you lie about?

47:19.236 --> 47:20.907
Stop scratching.
What did you lie about?

47:21.003 --> 47:23.140
- Let me scratch it.
- Stop. Don't you...

47:23.236 --> 47:24.941
Stop! What did you lie about, huh?

47:25.036 --> 47:26.514
What did you lie about?

47:26.804 --> 47:28.008
Stop it!

47:28.103 --> 47:31.240
What did you lie about, huh?

47:33.403 --> 47:38.108
Um, I lied about what the letter said.

47:40.503 --> 47:42.912
Why would you lie about that?

47:48.570 --> 47:51.013
We had a nice day, didn't we?

47:56.503 --> 47:58.912
The room's fine!

48:00.903 --> 48:03.006
Will?

48:03.103 --> 48:04.842
Jer?

48:09.103 --> 48:10.808
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

48:10.903 --> 48:12.540
I have been looking for you all day.

48:12.836 --> 48:15.178
- What? Where's Jen?
- Oh, shit's fucked up.

48:15.270 --> 48:17.305
- Well, now's not a good time.
- Oh, wow, sorry.

48:17.403 --> 48:19.244
I didn't know you had a...

48:19.336 --> 48:22.109
- I need to be home soon anyway.
- No, don't go.

48:22.203 --> 48:24.442
Will, please, can we talk alone?

48:24.537 --> 48:26.208
It's fine.

48:26.303 --> 48:27.508
No. Uh...

48:27.803 --> 48:29.338
Let's go together.

48:29.436 --> 48:32.936
Is there somewhere we can all go?

48:33.036 --> 48:35.912
I know a place nearby.

48:36.003 --> 48:37.242
♪ <i>Summer holiday</i> ♪

48:38.903 --> 48:41.006
♪ <i>On a summer holiday</i> ♪

48:42.836 --> 48:44.280
♪ <i>On a summer holiday</i> ♪

48:46.470 --> 48:48.811
♪ <i>On a summer holiday</i> ♪

48:49.969 --> 48:51.208
Whoo!

48:55.203 --> 48:56.839
She left me.

48:58.403 --> 49:02.370
We flew to London, and when we arrived...

49:02.470 --> 49:05.209
What happened?

49:05.303 --> 49:07.303
She changed her mind.

49:07.403 --> 49:09.005
You flew to London and back?

49:09.103 --> 49:11.377
We went to the hotel,
but you weren't there.

49:11.470 --> 49:13.243
- I tried calling you.
- Where were you?

49:13.336 --> 49:15.334
I was visiting family, which I
was supposed to do with you.

49:15.403 --> 49:16.903
No, it was fucking terrible.

49:17.003 --> 49:18.416
You don't understand what I went through.

49:18.503 --> 49:20.003
When we got there...

49:31.537 --> 49:33.173
I'll sing.

49:36.570 --> 49:39.013
Don't be a dick to her.

49:40.403 --> 49:43.313
Look, this is a good thing.

49:43.403 --> 49:47.938
Just man the fuck up, get
laid, and you'll be fine.

49:52.836 --> 49:54.212
Effy!

50:03.436 --> 50:06.073
She gave me an ultimatum.

50:06.170 --> 50:08.114
Either I leave you, or she would leave me.

50:08.203 --> 50:09.976
- But you hate ultimatums.
- I know.

50:10.069 --> 50:12.047
But she said that you...

50:29.069 --> 50:30.513
Did you read my letter?

50:34.436 --> 50:37.346
That was the hardest letter I ever wrote,

50:37.436 --> 50:40.380
not that I even write that many letters,

50:40.470 --> 50:43.448
unless you include e-mail
in my scope of writing...

53:19.502 --> 53:21.481
Nice note you wrote him.

53:27.236 --> 53:28.542
That was private.

53:28.836 --> 53:31.939
So how long have you known William?

53:32.036 --> 53:34.479
Since we were seven.

53:34.569 --> 53:36.774
How old are you now?

53:36.869 --> 53:39.279
You know how they say all
the greats die at 27?

53:39.370 --> 53:41.075
No.

53:41.170 --> 53:43.307
I'm 28.

53:47.903 --> 53:50.471
Sorry about your girlfriend leaving.

53:50.569 --> 53:54.378
I don't know how I came to this.

53:55.869 --> 53:57.904
She told me I lost myself in her.

53:58.003 --> 53:59.208
She needed space.

54:00.469 --> 54:02.504
I wanna tell you a story.

54:04.270 --> 54:05.407
It's about...

54:05.502 --> 54:06.946
What's going on?

54:07.036 --> 54:09.014
Telling him a story about Skagen.

54:09.103 --> 54:13.070
It's in the north of the country
where the two oceans meet.

54:13.170 --> 54:16.080
I heard of this place.

54:16.170 --> 54:18.273
I went there once with my mother.

54:18.370 --> 54:23.178
She was sad because her boyfriend left.

54:23.270 --> 54:29.146
And I was sad because I had a
fight with my best friend.

54:29.236 --> 54:32.907
So she brought me to the end of the beach,

54:33.003 --> 54:36.345
and then she pointed to the
right where the Baltic Sea is.

54:36.435 --> 54:37.538
I knew that.

54:37.836 --> 54:39.371
Yeah, from Risk.

54:41.136 --> 54:47.012
So it's a very beautiful and very blue sea.

54:47.103 --> 54:49.944
The waves travel west.

54:50.036 --> 54:51.479
Current.

54:51.569 --> 54:54.013
What?

54:54.103 --> 54:56.944
Current, not waves. Waves...

54:57.036 --> 54:59.344
Current travels west, not waves.

55:01.869 --> 55:07.541
So the current travels west,
and she pointed to the left.

55:07.836 --> 55:10.041
- North Sea?
- Yeah.

55:10.136 --> 55:13.205
Also a very beautiful blue sea,

55:13.303 --> 55:17.940
but the current travels east.

55:18.036 --> 55:20.980
And then she pointed to the middle,

55:21.069 --> 55:23.546
and she said that...

55:23.836 --> 55:27.212
that is the perfect relationship.

55:27.303 --> 55:30.179
You can look to the left, and
you can look to the right,

55:30.270 --> 55:34.078
and both seas are there,

55:34.170 --> 55:37.046
and they can meet in the middle,

55:37.136 --> 55:39.341
but they never lose
themselves in each other.

55:39.435 --> 55:42.777
They're always themselves no matter what.

55:42.869 --> 55:45.143
That's beautiful.

55:45.236 --> 55:47.145
It's better than what he said.

55:47.236 --> 55:48.804
What did he say?

55:48.903 --> 55:51.006
To go out and get laid.

55:54.236 --> 55:56.839
That's terrible advice.

55:58.803 --> 56:01.337
- Shark bite!
- Ow! What are you doing?

56:01.435 --> 56:03.004
It's a shark bite.
You're afraid of sharks.

56:03.103 --> 56:05.444
Dude, you gave her a shark bite.

56:07.136 --> 56:08.442
Where are you going?

56:08.536 --> 56:10.310
Are you gonna read me the letter?

56:10.402 --> 56:13.210
- No.
- The mermaid.

56:13.303 --> 56:15.144
We have to go.

56:15.236 --> 56:16.975
We need to see what made him smile.

56:17.069 --> 56:19.308
I thought you didn't care.

56:19.402 --> 56:20.436
Please.

56:22.036 --> 56:24.139
I'd like to go.

56:24.236 --> 56:27.077
It's getting dark.
We have to hurry.

56:33.069 --> 56:34.478
But we need another one.

56:34.569 --> 56:36.478
Yeah.

56:36.569 --> 56:39.173
So find another one.

56:42.803 --> 56:44.247
What about that one?

56:44.335 --> 56:45.506
That's somebody's.

56:45.803 --> 56:47.110
They can't do that.

56:47.203 --> 56:49.407
If they're not using it,
they should put it back.

56:49.502 --> 56:52.309
Yeah, but if you take it,
you're stealing their money.

56:52.402 --> 56:55.403
We don't need the money.
We need the bike, right?

56:58.003 --> 56:59.810
You gonna steal it?

57:01.936 --> 57:03.345
Yeah, I'm stealing it.

57:03.435 --> 57:06.538
You can't steal something that's free.

57:06.836 --> 57:08.336
Like love.

57:10.236 --> 57:13.406
We're going this way, so you
can just catch up with us.

57:22.203 --> 57:23.874
Okay.

57:26.469 --> 57:29.970
Walking, walking...

57:36.969 --> 57:38.844
Hey!

57:40.469 --> 57:42.106
Hey! "Go!"

57:42.203 --> 57:44.874
- Oh, no.
- Go!

57:51.869 --> 57:53.540
Sorry. Sorry.

57:53.836 --> 57:55.905
We're Americans. Sorry.

57:56.003 --> 57:58.072
He's going for the Tour de France, man.

57:59.836 --> 58:02.144
I mean, look, it's the same as the States.

58:02.235 --> 58:04.873
It's just good to remember it, that's all.

58:04.969 --> 58:07.947
- We're almost there.
- All right.

58:08.036 --> 58:09.945
Do you think there's gonna
be somewhere to buy

58:10.036 --> 58:13.775
like some snacks or anything like that?

58:15.969 --> 58:17.412
It's here!

58:21.936 --> 58:23.242
Where?

58:25.235 --> 58:27.804
- What happened?
- Shit.

58:27.903 --> 58:30.506
Fucking great.

58:30.803 --> 58:33.178
I just need a second for my eyes to adjust.

58:33.269 --> 58:34.804
- Nobody move.
- What now?

58:34.903 --> 58:36.812
I think we should go back
to the lighted area.

58:36.903 --> 58:38.522
Maybe our eyes will adjust
in a couple seconds,

58:38.569 --> 58:40.205
then we can catch a glimpse.

58:40.302 --> 58:42.380
No, I think we should go
back to where the light is.

58:42.435 --> 58:43.970
There's no one here, and it's dark,

58:44.069 --> 58:46.512
and my eyes are not adjusted.

58:46.803 --> 58:48.405
It's okay. It's working.
My eyes...

58:48.502 --> 58:51.003
I'm starting to see things.
Relax, all right?

58:53.136 --> 58:54.442
Can I have one, too?

58:54.536 --> 58:56.980
What, you're allowed to smoke now?

58:57.069 --> 58:58.512
Yes.

58:58.803 --> 59:00.110
Here.

59:00.202 --> 59:01.146
Yeah.

59:01.235 --> 59:02.542
Here, have your own.

59:13.435 --> 59:16.107
If this was a war, you'd be dead.

59:16.202 --> 59:17.839
Why do you say that?

59:19.435 --> 59:21.413
Third light.
Everyone knows that.

59:21.502 --> 59:23.537
Triangulation.

59:23.836 --> 59:26.279
Come on, Jer. Jesus Christ.

59:26.369 --> 59:28.506
- Say cheese.
- What?

59:28.803 --> 59:30.008
- Oh, damn!
- Jesus Christ.

59:30.103 --> 59:32.137
I saw the mermaid when the flash went off!

59:32.235 --> 59:34.213
Do it again.

59:34.302 --> 59:35.939
There! There!
She's right there!

59:36.036 --> 59:37.310
- Let's get closer.
- I didn't see it.

59:37.369 --> 59:39.006
Go again.

59:39.103 --> 59:41.842
It's so small.
I need to do the pose.

59:41.936 --> 59:44.311
No. Don't go down on the
rocks when it's dark.

59:44.402 --> 59:45.505
Oh, fuck!

59:45.803 --> 59:48.042
- William?
- Will, man, you okay?

59:48.135 --> 59:49.306
Fuck you!

59:49.402 --> 59:50.880
What did we do?

59:50.969 --> 59:52.469
He's talking to his dad.

59:52.569 --> 59:54.547
Let's try again.

01:00:01.903 --> 01:00:04.278
Effy, come here.

01:00:16.235 --> 01:00:17.269
What are you doing?

01:00:17.369 --> 01:00:18.472
Trust me.

01:00:18.569 --> 01:00:20.513
You went to all these places today?

01:00:20.803 --> 01:00:24.043
Yeah, and we found his
grandfather in Skagen.

01:00:24.135 --> 01:00:26.170
You found your family?

01:00:26.269 --> 01:00:27.906
I did.

01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:30.241
My dad's dad.

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:31.506
He's alive.

01:00:34.335 --> 01:00:35.404
Done.

01:00:37.169 --> 01:00:41.204
I heard Culture Box is good.
We should go there.

01:00:41.302 --> 01:00:43.302
Yeah, my friend's older
brother, he works there,

01:00:43.402 --> 01:00:45.039
so we don't have to show ID.

01:00:45.135 --> 01:00:47.306
How old are you?

01:00:51.036 --> 01:00:52.342
I'm 14.

01:00:52.435 --> 01:00:54.310
Seriously?

01:00:54.402 --> 01:00:57.778
15 soon.

01:00:59.836 --> 01:01:02.007
Okay.

01:01:02.102 --> 01:01:05.205
You've been hanging out all
day with a 14-year-old?

01:01:05.302 --> 01:01:07.041
Use your common sense.

01:01:07.135 --> 01:01:11.045
H-He's that stranger you're
not supposed to talk to.

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:12.909
- He's dangerous.
- All right, man, relax.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.003
It's not what you think, all right?

01:01:14.102 --> 01:01:15.012
Nothing's happened.

01:01:15.102 --> 01:01:17.080
I walked in on you, okay?

01:01:17.169 --> 01:01:19.204
- Don't lie to me again.
- What's going on?

01:01:19.302 --> 01:01:20.541
I'm not lying.

01:01:20.836 --> 01:01:23.837
She is 14 years old.

01:01:24.969 --> 01:01:28.139
Jer. Jer! Jer!

01:01:28.235 --> 01:01:30.804
You know, every time I think
you've hit rock bottom,

01:01:30.903 --> 01:01:32.972
you find a lower level!

01:01:33.068 --> 01:01:36.444
You know, it's not enough that you
destroy every fucking thing you touch.

01:01:36.536 --> 01:01:39.139
- Now you're a pedophile.
- A pedophile?

01:01:39.235 --> 01:01:41.975
You don't know what you're talking about.

01:01:42.068 --> 01:01:43.808
You're a fucking locust.

01:01:43.903 --> 01:01:45.175
Stop scaring her.

01:01:45.269 --> 01:01:46.440
Scaring her?

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.207
You're an asshole, okay?

01:01:48.302 --> 01:01:50.974
Nobody likes you.

01:01:51.068 --> 01:01:53.137
You connect with teenagers.

01:01:53.235 --> 01:01:55.406
Who the fuck are you to talk?

01:01:55.502 --> 01:01:57.301
Did you leave your best
friend for some bitch

01:01:57.302 --> 01:02:01.212
just 'cause you get some for
the first time in years?

01:02:01.302 --> 01:02:04.143
You tried to fuck Jen.

01:02:04.235 --> 01:02:05.872
What?

01:02:05.968 --> 01:02:08.469
Why would she lie to me?

01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:11.308
Just tell me the truth.

01:02:11.402 --> 01:02:13.471
Is that what she told you?

01:02:14.803 --> 01:02:16.109
Fuck you, man.

01:02:17.836 --> 01:02:19.972
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Walk away.

01:02:24.235 --> 01:02:27.076
Get off me!
I'll fucking DDT you, man!

01:02:27.169 --> 01:02:28.169
I swear it, I will!

01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:29.804
Stop it!

01:02:29.903 --> 01:02:32.039
Stop it, man! Stop!

01:02:35.035 --> 01:02:37.070
Listen to me.

01:02:37.169 --> 01:02:39.204
I didn't try anything, all right?

01:02:39.302 --> 01:02:41.371
I tested her because I don't trust her.

01:02:41.469 --> 01:02:42.913
That's all.

01:02:43.002 --> 01:02:45.879
I don't believe you.

01:02:45.968 --> 01:02:48.412
Where the fuck you going, man, huh? Huh?

01:02:50.135 --> 01:02:52.409
Where is she? Where is she?

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:53.912
Effy?

01:02:56.935 --> 01:02:58.614
Jeremy, you don't know where you're going!

01:05:52.235 --> 01:05:53.542
Hey!

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:39.309
Hi. It's me.

01:06:39.402 --> 01:06:43.369
It sounded like your voice,
so I guess it's you.

01:06:43.469 --> 01:06:46.174
Thanks for the help.

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:50.838
Yeah. I'm done with visiting
my grandfather, but, um...

01:06:50.935 --> 01:06:52.844
I don't know why you left.

01:06:52.935 --> 01:06:54.413
We should go to Culture Box,

01:06:54.502 --> 01:06:57.775
get a proper goodbye, that's all.

01:06:57.868 --> 01:06:59.903
Uh, call me back.

01:07:00.002 --> 01:07:02.775
Oh, wait. Never mind.

01:07:02.868 --> 01:07:05.073
Yeah, okay, um...

01:07:05.169 --> 01:07:07.272
Have a good one, I guess.

01:07:07.369 --> 01:07:10.176
Uh, life. By one, I meant life.

01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:12.110
Have a good life.

01:07:26.369 --> 01:07:28.176
I just... It's me again.

01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:30.227
I just wanted you to know
that I didn't mean that

01:07:30.302 --> 01:07:34.905
in a snarky, fuck off,
have-a-good-life way.

01:07:35.002 --> 01:07:36.946
I meant it genuinely.

01:07:37.035 --> 01:07:39.343
Seriously. Have a good life.

01:07:54.335 --> 01:07:56.778
Hey, hey.

01:08:04.968 --> 01:08:07.344
Oh, my God! You came!

01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:11.172
I'm so happy you came!

01:08:13.502 --> 01:08:15.911
What happened to Berlin?

01:08:16.002 --> 01:08:17.207
Where?

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:20.371
You said you were going to Berlin.

01:08:21.902 --> 01:08:23.810
You wanna do shots?

01:08:23.902 --> 01:08:25.073
Uh...

01:08:27.335 --> 01:08:28.778
Yeah.

01:08:31.202 --> 01:08:33.042
All right.

01:08:56.801 --> 01:08:59.178
Your go. Your go.

01:09:30.968 --> 01:09:32.412
I...

01:09:38.835 --> 01:09:40.438
I have to go.

01:09:43.068 --> 01:09:44.908
I think I'm in love.

01:09:49.035 --> 01:09:51.171
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:52.769
You came.

01:09:52.868 --> 01:09:54.403
Yeah.

01:09:54.501 --> 01:09:56.411
- Did you get my message?
- Yeah.

01:09:56.501 --> 01:09:58.138
I just wanted to give you this.

01:09:58.235 --> 01:10:01.304
It's important that you give
it to your grandfather.

01:10:01.402 --> 01:10:05.039
Are you gonna tell me what it says?

01:10:05.135 --> 01:10:07.272
Where's Jeremy?

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:09.313
I don't care.

01:10:09.402 --> 01:10:13.210
Why did he say all that stuff about you?

01:10:20.835 --> 01:10:23.245
Let's get out of here.

01:10:23.335 --> 01:10:25.313
We can stay.

01:10:43.269 --> 01:10:46.110
What was that all about?

01:10:46.202 --> 01:10:49.203
I told him that you're my boyfriend.

01:10:49.302 --> 01:10:52.802
I think I'm in love with you.

01:10:52.902 --> 01:10:55.539
It was just to get rid of him.

01:11:00.369 --> 01:11:01.505
- Cheers.
- Skoal!

01:11:01.802 --> 01:11:02.779
Skoal!

01:11:05.802 --> 01:11:07.337
You're supposed to slam it.

01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:10.140
I don't want to slam it.
It's too strong like that.

01:11:10.235 --> 01:11:11.940
Come on.

01:11:16.135 --> 01:11:17.112
Whoo!

01:11:19.035 --> 01:11:21.478
Are you going to visit Thomas
Vinter in Skagen tomorrow?

01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:24.206
Only, uh...

01:11:24.302 --> 01:11:26.540
Only if you come with me.

01:11:29.068 --> 01:11:30.375
Are you trying to get me drunk?

01:11:30.468 --> 01:11:34.106
What? No, no, no.
No, that's not it.

01:11:35.835 --> 01:11:38.813
You're trying to get yourself drunk.

01:11:39.968 --> 01:11:43.174
- Shark bite!
- Ow! That hurt!

01:11:43.269 --> 01:11:45.473
Look, I'm sorry about the
shark bite, all right?

01:11:45.568 --> 01:11:49.274
I know it's primitive, but
it's a sign of affection.

01:11:49.369 --> 01:11:51.505
Teenagers do shit like that all the time.

01:11:51.802 --> 01:11:54.110
I don't like teenagers.

01:11:55.335 --> 01:11:57.778
Good point. All right.

01:11:57.868 --> 01:12:00.812
Get me back.
You can get me back. Come on.

01:12:00.902 --> 01:12:02.141
Okay.

01:12:04.269 --> 01:12:06.371
Block!

01:12:06.468 --> 01:12:08.003
You told me I could do it!

01:12:08.102 --> 01:12:10.807
I'm not just gonna let you do it.

01:12:11.868 --> 01:12:13.504
Watch out!

01:12:13.802 --> 01:12:15.541
What... Ow!

01:12:15.835 --> 01:12:17.813
Let's do it for real.
Close your eyes.

01:12:17.902 --> 01:12:19.107
- What?
- Close your eyes.

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:20.873
Come on, it's fair.

01:12:23.102 --> 01:12:25.080
- Ohh!
- Shark slap.

01:12:25.169 --> 01:12:26.475
- Shark slap? What the fuck?
- Shark punch!

01:12:26.568 --> 01:12:29.512
What are you doing? Stop it!

01:12:29.802 --> 01:12:30.836
Let's dance.

01:12:54.068 --> 01:12:55.841
Close your eyes.

01:12:57.135 --> 01:13:00.204
Promise you're not gonna slap me?

01:13:00.302 --> 01:13:02.246
I promise.

01:13:17.135 --> 01:13:18.942
Shark kiss.

01:13:21.535 --> 01:13:25.105
You trying to get me in trouble?

01:13:25.202 --> 01:13:27.372
I promise you won't get in trouble.

01:13:30.835 --> 01:13:32.904
Let's get some more to drink.

01:13:55.434 --> 01:13:57.378
Uh...

01:13:57.468 --> 01:13:59.844
You buy the drinks.

01:14:02.301 --> 01:14:04.370
I gotta take a piss.

01:14:14.202 --> 01:14:15.338
Excuse me?

01:14:25.035 --> 01:14:26.535
American?

01:14:26.835 --> 01:14:29.972
Yeah. Yes, I am.

01:14:30.068 --> 01:14:33.443
Make sure you don't piss on your leg.

01:14:44.234 --> 01:14:46.803
Hey! Where'd you go?

01:14:51.468 --> 01:14:53.174
Wait!

01:15:17.968 --> 01:15:21.105
Whoa! Hey! What's going on?

01:15:22.334 --> 01:15:24.835
American boy, stay out of this.

01:15:27.501 --> 01:15:28.911
Who are you? Who is he?

01:15:29.002 --> 01:15:30.946
Just wait a minute. It's fine.

01:15:40.334 --> 01:15:41.505
Hey, let go of her.

01:15:41.802 --> 01:15:44.780
This is none of your business.

01:15:44.868 --> 01:15:46.868
You're making it my business.

01:15:47.902 --> 01:15:49.379
I said let go of her!

01:15:49.468 --> 01:15:50.810
Stop it, stop it!

01:15:50.902 --> 01:15:51.811
Fuck! Hey, hey, whoa!

01:15:51.902 --> 01:15:53.107
You taking a swing at me?

01:15:53.201 --> 01:15:55.009
Relax, man.
You're being aggressive.

01:15:55.102 --> 01:15:56.943
Let's talk about this like adults.

01:15:57.035 --> 01:15:58.069
Please stop.

01:15:58.168 --> 01:15:59.145
Aah!

01:16:00.334 --> 01:16:01.971
What are you doing?

01:16:02.068 --> 01:16:03.238
Fuck!

01:16:05.168 --> 01:16:06.475
- Are you okay?
- I'm so fucked.

01:16:06.568 --> 01:16:09.205
You just punched my mom's boyfriend.

01:16:13.868 --> 01:16:15.903
Room 340.

01:16:16.002 --> 01:16:17.843
Okay.

01:16:22.134 --> 01:16:26.237
I see there's only one person
registered to this room.

01:16:26.334 --> 01:16:29.437
We'll need a passport for the young lady.

01:16:29.535 --> 01:16:30.945
Excuse me?

01:16:31.035 --> 01:16:34.535
We'll need a copy of the passport
for anyone staying in the hotel.

01:16:34.835 --> 01:16:37.438
It is the rules. Interpol.

01:16:47.802 --> 01:16:49.177
Yeah, okay?

01:16:49.268 --> 01:16:51.109
She needs a passport.

01:16:54.468 --> 01:16:56.844
Let's go.

01:17:13.501 --> 01:17:15.274
Stay here, okay?

01:18:07.067 --> 01:18:10.045
What are you doing in here?
I told you to wait outside.

01:19:38.967 --> 01:19:45.845

01:19:45.934 --> 01:19:48.208

Enjoy your evening?

01:20:24.802 --> 01:20:26.279
Asshole.

01:20:55.067 --> 01:20:57.170
I need some water.

01:21:00.501 --> 01:21:02.035
Here.

01:21:36.134 --> 01:21:39.907
We can go to Skagen tomorrow if you want.

01:21:40.001 --> 01:21:42.877
What about you?

01:21:44.301 --> 01:21:46.279
Yeah.

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:51.176
I'm like a leave falling from a tree.

01:21:54.168 --> 01:21:57.146
Wherever the wind blows, I'll go.

01:22:05.535 --> 01:22:07.808
I love you.

01:22:14.301 --> 01:22:17.279
You told me you loved me already.

01:22:28.368 --> 01:22:30.209
Do you want me?

01:22:34.134 --> 01:22:35.510
Yeah.

01:23:06.001 --> 01:23:07.979
You shouldn't be doing that.

01:23:28.301 --> 01:23:30.472
It's illegal.

01:23:34.201 --> 01:23:37.509
I'll be 15 in a couple of days.

01:23:40.301 --> 01:23:43.006
I promise nothing bad will happen.

01:25:30.368 --> 01:25:33.107
It's been ringing all morning.

01:25:35.567 --> 01:25:37.772
It's my mom's boyfriend.

01:25:42.401 --> 01:25:44.242
Five missed calls.

01:25:57.001 --> 01:25:59.172
You wanna grab a coffee?

01:26:01.034 --> 01:26:02.807
I don't drink coffee.

01:26:02.901 --> 01:26:04.936
Of course you don't.

01:26:09.867 --> 01:26:13.311
You know how I told you that, um...

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:15.810
I never saw my father smile?

01:26:17.401 --> 01:26:20.174
I saw him smile once.

01:26:20.268 --> 01:26:21.939
The day he left.

01:26:23.501 --> 01:26:25.910
And we went to a ballgame.

01:26:26.001 --> 01:26:31.036
He... took me to a restaurant.

01:26:31.134 --> 01:26:33.476
He told me things would be different.

01:26:35.134 --> 01:26:39.306
So he drops me off, and
I walk up to the door,

01:26:39.401 --> 01:26:43.970
and right before I go in, I turn to him,

01:26:44.067 --> 01:26:46.238
and he smiled...

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.175
right at me.

01:26:50.268 --> 01:26:51.870
Then he disappeared.

01:26:52.967 --> 01:26:56.309
I never saw him again.

01:26:56.401 --> 01:27:00.776
What kind of prick smiles
at his son, then leaves?

01:27:00.867 --> 01:27:04.107
He smiled because he believed it.

01:27:04.201 --> 01:27:07.372
Just didn't know how to do it.

01:27:07.467 --> 01:27:11.241
Fuck that day.
Wish it never happened.

01:27:13.234 --> 01:27:14.870
You should go home.

01:27:14.967 --> 01:27:17.172
I should read you the letter first.

01:27:24.334 --> 01:27:26.278
"Dear Father,"

01:27:26.368 --> 01:27:29.470
I haven't been happy since we moved here,

01:27:29.567 --> 01:27:32.977
not since Mads took me around in Copenhagen

01:27:33.067 --> 01:27:37.409
and told me to look happy
in the pictures for you.

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.104
We're in America now, and I hate it here.

01:27:41.201 --> 01:27:46.508
I peed in my pants in class
because I didn't know the words...

01:27:46.801 --> 01:27:50.371
to ask how to go to the toilet.

01:27:50.467 --> 01:27:52.502
I hate it here.

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:55.904
Do you know what else I hate?

01:27:56.001 --> 01:27:58.001
You.

01:27:58.101 --> 01:28:00.238
I will never be like you.

01:28:00.334 --> 01:28:06.210
If you think about me, don't,
because I don't think about you.

01:28:06.301 --> 01:28:07.937
"Daniel."

01:28:32.867 --> 01:28:34.503
Thank you.

01:29:55.101 --> 01:29:58.272
He did leave this for you, Mr. Jeremy.

01:29:58.367 --> 01:29:59.538
Yeah, thanks.

01:30:13.134 --> 01:30:14.475
Okay. Thanks.

01:32:08.534 --> 01:32:10.205
Thomas Vinter?

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:12.938
Yes?

01:32:13.034 --> 01:32:16.035
My father was born Daniel Vinter.

01:32:16.134 --> 01:32:17.805
He was your son.

01:32:20.534 --> 01:32:23.035
I had once a boy called Daniel Vinter.

01:32:23.134 --> 01:32:26.202
It's many years ago.

01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.141
That's my father.

01:32:31.967 --> 01:32:33.273
You're my grandfather.

01:32:37.034 --> 01:32:41.409
Look, I have five grandchildren now,

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:44.808
and they are all playing inside the house.

01:32:44.901 --> 01:32:46.970
Wait.

01:32:47.067 --> 01:32:49.203
I just came here to give you this.

01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:14.506
How is your father?

01:33:14.801 --> 01:33:17.142
He's dead.

01:33:17.233 --> 01:33:19.075
I'm sorry.

01:33:22.333 --> 01:33:24.311
Was he a good father to you?

01:33:25.934 --> 01:33:27.240
No.

01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:29.106
He wasn't.

01:33:34.233 --> 01:33:37.041
But I guess he wouldn't know how, would he?
