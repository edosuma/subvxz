WEBVTT

00:00.452 --> 00:02.208
Previously on Ugly Betty...

00:02.218 --> 00:03.533
Killer poncho.

00:03.543 --> 00:04.911
Thanks!

00:05.026 --> 00:07.094
- I'm Betty Suarez.
- Hi, Betty.

00:07.114 --> 00:08.848
I'm your new assistant.

00:08.993 --> 00:11.527
I got the job because Bradford
Meade didn't want his son

00:11.537 --> 00:13.411
to be tempted to sleep
with his assistant.

00:13.421 --> 00:16.181
Nepotistic son of a bitch
gives my job to his...

00:16.192 --> 00:17.608
His son.

00:17.865 --> 00:21.172
So the question is,
how do we get to Bradford?

00:21.180 --> 00:22.914
We use Daniel.

00:22.927 --> 00:24.196
Who is this?

00:24.206 --> 00:27.036
He's a man of many,
many secrets, Daniel.

00:27.048 --> 00:28.331
Dig a little deeper,

00:28.348 --> 00:31.940
and you may find he's capable
of practically anything.

00:34.036 --> 00:35.490
Excuse me, sir.

00:35.508 --> 00:37.793
You know,
I think I was here before them.

00:40.377 --> 00:42.613
This is a party for my boss.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.961
Daniel Meade--
I'm his assistant.

00:46.025 --> 00:50.043
No, I am, I am. Here, look,
I have--I have my xerox card.

00:50.056 --> 00:51.992
It's here somewhere.
I know I have it.

00:52.005 --> 00:54.290
They don't just give
these to anybody.

00:54.305 --> 00:56.293
Oh, see, she knows me. Amanda!

00:56.305 --> 00:58.173
- Right this way.
- Amanda!

00:59.116 --> 01:01.390
Sweetheart, why don't you
come back on monday night?

01:01.407 --> 01:03.572
That's when we let anybody in.

01:08.057 --> 01:11.511
Oh! Here, look, I found it.
My--my xerox card.

01:11.527 --> 01:15.460
I'm standing outside Vamp,
Manhattan's hot spot de jour,

01:15.475 --> 01:19.213
and it's nothing but trendy and fendi
here for Daniel Meade's cover party,

01:19.226 --> 01:23.390
as we celebrate his first issue
of "Mode" hitting the stands.

01:23.406 --> 01:26.151
More than a few eyebrows
were raised on the catwalk

01:26.168 --> 01:29.430
when Meade was chosen to
replace the late Fey Sommers

01:29.447 --> 01:32.882
over seasoned creative
director Wilhelmina Slater.

01:32.895 --> 01:36.711
Miss Slater, this way!
Wilhelmina, hi! You're gorgeous!

01:37.387 --> 01:38.301
What'd I miss?

01:38.316 --> 01:41.210
"The Times," "Page Six," "The News"--
they've been all over Daniel.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.900
Heidi Klum is a no-show,
Isaac's in the back getting sloppy,

01:43.915 --> 01:47.222
oh, and... wait till you see
Veronica Jensen's face-lift.

01:47.237 --> 01:48.890
Lawsuit!

01:49.747 --> 01:53.212
Look at them, falling all over
themselves trying to get a quote.

01:53.225 --> 01:55.610
As if he actually knew
anything about fashion.

01:55.628 --> 01:58.733
The man went to Vera Wang's spring line,
gave her a high-five.

01:59.108 --> 02:02.021
# But I can't seem to #
# get you over here #

02:02.035 --> 02:05.563
# To help take this off, #
# baby can't you see #

02:05.577 --> 02:08.332
# How these clothes
are fitting on me? #

02:09.608 --> 02:13.073
# Dance! #
# Dance dance revolution #

02:13.088 --> 02:15.833
# Keep ya body movin' #

02:19.105 --> 02:21.272
# Now first things first... #

02:25.005 --> 02:25.753
Hi.

02:25.768 --> 02:27.851
Walter, what are
you doing here?

02:27.868 --> 02:29.552
Okay, my turn.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.271
Betty, check it out.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.592
Actually, I think, uh,

02:35.605 --> 02:38.061
I'm the one that should be
asking the questions here.

02:38.077 --> 02:42.151
Like, what were you doing out at
some club with your boss till...

02:42.245 --> 02:44.241
9:45?

02:44.255 --> 02:46.711
Well, it was a party
for his first issue.

02:46.728 --> 02:48.813
And why am I explaining
this to you, Walter?

02:48.825 --> 02:50.413
We're not even dating anymore.

02:50.428 --> 02:51.950
Yeah, and whose fault is that?

02:51.966 --> 02:54.651
Well, you're the one
who dumped me for Gina.

02:54.668 --> 02:56.272
For just two days,

02:56.287 --> 02:58.990
and it takes longer than
that to digest corn.

02:59.005 --> 03:02.321
As beautiful an apology as that is,
Walter, I think we're over.

03:02.335 --> 03:03.963
Come on.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.991
Betty, look what I brought you.

03:06.005 --> 03:08.231
This game's been on
back-order for two months.

03:08.246 --> 03:10.470
Couldn't even use my discount.
Full price.

03:10.485 --> 03:11.923
So I'm supposed to
forgive you because

03:11.955 --> 03:14.601
you couldn't use your
employee discount?

03:14.618 --> 03:17.371
Walter, go home.

03:17.385 --> 03:20.031
I would,
but we're in the middle of a game here.

03:20.047 --> 03:21.550
Yes!

03:21.566 --> 03:23.242
Okay...

03:23.255 --> 03:25.270
now I'm gonna go home.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:36.016 --> 03:38.170
Full price!

03:46.865 --> 03:50.712
July issue. Black lace push-up bra, 
red mesh thong.

03:50.725 --> 03:52.072
See, I never forget a face.

03:52.087 --> 03:55.441
Careful, Daniel,
I think she's only 12.

03:55.697 --> 03:57.410
Hi, dad.

03:58.665 --> 04:00.983
I see that you've
been mingling.

04:00.997 --> 04:03.351
Are you talking to anyone
who actually matters?

04:03.365 --> 04:05.911
I've done 40
interviews already.

04:05.925 --> 04:08.241
Look's like my first
issue's a home run, huh?

04:08.257 --> 04:10.161
Yeah, you pulled it off.

04:10.175 --> 04:12.251
Christy Benson from "New
York Minute" seems to think

04:12.258 --> 04:14.380
I did a little more
than pull it off.

04:14.395 --> 04:15.900
You're the editor
of "Mode," Daniel.

04:15.916 --> 04:17.310
"Mode" sells "Mode."

04:17.325 --> 04:20.003
Mr. Meade,
can we get a 2-shot with Daniel?

04:20.368 --> 04:23.340
A couple more, sir?
This way. Thank you.

04:27.108 --> 04:29.132
Well, if that wasn't
a cover shot--

04:29.148 --> 04:33.243
media mogul Bradford Meade and his son,
the shining star.

04:33.255 --> 04:34.840
The issue's a big hit, Daniel,

04:34.855 --> 04:36.953
and your brother really
would've been proud.

04:36.966 --> 04:38.483
Well, I'm not so
sure about that.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.140
What did I do, anyway?

04:40.157 --> 04:42.741
"Mode" sells
"Mode." Right, dad?

04:42.835 --> 04:44.820
You remember the yacht?

04:44.848 --> 04:46.841
Your dad throws this
party to introduce Alex

04:46.856 --> 04:48.512
to the entire fashion community

04:48.527 --> 04:49.942
as the new editor of "Hudson."

04:49.955 --> 04:52.483
He walks in with a black
pinstripe Armani jacket,

04:52.495 --> 04:54.291
white  tuxedo front shirt

04:54.307 --> 04:57.041
and polka-dot boxers.

04:58.085 --> 05:01.152
That  picture ended up in almost
every newspaper in the country.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.643
Circulation went up 38%.

05:03.658 --> 05:05.060
That is an editor.

05:05.075 --> 05:06.140
Well, you should've
told me that, dad.

05:06.178 --> 05:08.722
I would've gladly
dropped my pants for you.

05:10.295 --> 05:12.700
Oh, sorry.

05:12.716 --> 05:15.621
Maybe it was insensitive of
me to mention him tonight?

05:15.637 --> 05:19.442
This is Daniel's party,
but, uh, Alex is such a...

05:19.456 --> 05:21.530
tough act to follow.

05:22.376 --> 05:25.411
So was the club amazing?

05:25.426 --> 05:28.661
They say people wait in line for,
like, three hours just to get inside.

05:28.678 --> 05:29.971
Some even more.

05:29.985 --> 05:31.460
You're home early.

05:31.478 --> 05:32.852
I checked your homework.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.191
Was there any famous
people there?

05:34.228 --> 05:35.731
Did you bring me a matchbook?

05:35.747 --> 05:37.010
Justin, I forgot.

05:37.028 --> 05:39.962
Well, what about the bathroom doors? Do
they really fog over when you push a button?

05:39.996 --> 05:42.111
Justin,  I...
didn't have to use the bathroom.

05:42.128 --> 05:44.700
Okay, Justin,
go get ready for bed.

05:45.477 --> 05:48.990
And by the way,
I read your boss' first issue.

05:49.006 --> 05:54.170
A little bulky, but good balance of
style, accessories and puff pieces.

05:56.627 --> 05:58.851
You didn't get in, did you?

05:59.857 --> 06:02.523
I have to go e-mail Daniel
his itinerary for tomorrow.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.052
SÃ­entate.

06:04.347 --> 06:06.651
Why do you do this
to yourself, hmm?

06:06.665 --> 06:09.342
I keep telling you,
those places aren't for people like us.

06:09.357 --> 06:13.111
Hilda, please, just... don't.

06:15.448 --> 06:17.030
Okay.

06:17.046 --> 06:21.593
Okay, look, if this is so
important to you, let me help you.

06:21.606 --> 06:23.133
- How?
- How?!

06:23.148 --> 06:26.553
I am the top-selling Herbalux
sale associate in my district,

06:26.565 --> 06:29.701
and all because I know
how to sell myself--

06:29.718 --> 06:31.982
the hair, the face,
the clothes.

06:31.998 --> 06:34.621
You gotta look it to be it.
That's the Herbalux way.

06:34.635 --> 06:37.731
Thanks, but I don't think so.

06:38.826 --> 06:41.632
Betty, mama...

06:41.647 --> 06:43.692
you wanna fit in
with these people?

06:43.700 --> 06:45.484
I got news for you--

06:46.357 --> 06:48.156
they're not gonna change.

06:48.166 --> 06:51.056
Mnh-mnh. You have to.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.042
I'm gonna get chocolate sauce.

07:33.047 --> 07:34.500
Hey.

07:34.626 --> 07:36.230
Good morning to you, too.

07:36.245 --> 07:37.883
You know what the doctor said.

07:37.895 --> 07:39.703
You already threw
away my cigars.

07:39.716 --> 07:41.440
- One lousy cup of coffee--
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:41.456 --> 07:43.520
Have you been going to medical
school on your lunch hour?

07:43.555 --> 07:46.562
Dad, you have to take this more
seriously. This is your heart.

07:46.577 --> 07:48.563
- Have you taken your pill?
- I only have a few left.

07:48.596 --> 07:50.963
- I'm trying to make 'em last.
- Dad, take it.

07:50.976 --> 07:52.143
We'll get a refill.

07:52.158 --> 07:54.463
All right, I'm taking it,
I'm taking it.

07:54.476 --> 07:57.620
You know, I actually think I'm making
some headway on this H.M.O. thing.

07:57.638 --> 08:00.052
I finally got a real person
on the phone yesterday

08:00.066 --> 08:02.861
instead of some
stupid recording.

08:04.287 --> 08:07.151
I had to wash it
down with something.

08:22.078 --> 08:24.112
You didn't stay
long last night.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.632
No, sorry.

08:25.645 --> 08:28.101
I had to wake up early for
the conference call to Milan,

08:28.118 --> 08:30.800
and then go over 
the kiera shoot proofs, and then

08:30.816 --> 08:33.191
approve the models
for the Paris spread.

08:33.205 --> 08:34.701
It's 9:15.

08:34.715 --> 08:38.652
Well, someone's got to hold this
magazine together, Bradford.

08:38.664 --> 08:41.393
I mean, Daniel is trying,

08:41.407 --> 08:45.040
but, uh,
some people are just naturals.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.480
Don't worry.

08:46.495 --> 08:48.571
I've got his back.

09:00.925 --> 09:03.623
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

09:03.638 --> 09:06.101
Well, don't you look... sweaty?

09:06.116 --> 09:09.513
I've been in the archives.
Daniel wanted all these back issues.

09:09.537 --> 09:12.732
Mm-hmm. Well, we missed you 
at the party last night.

09:12.747 --> 09:16.533
What happened,
sale at the 99 cents store?

09:17.167 --> 09:19.802
No, I... I couldn't get in.

09:19.815 --> 09:23.033
Are you serious?
Oh, you poor thing.

09:23.047 --> 09:24.672
Those jerks at the door...

09:24.685 --> 09:28.421
all they seem to care
about is appearance.

09:29.958 --> 09:33.442
Look, it's all about appearance.
That's all Alex did to "Hudson."

09:33.455 --> 09:36.860
He changed the font, the layout,
hired some trendy photographers,

09:36.878 --> 09:39.231
and my father thinks
he's some kind of hero.

09:39.247 --> 09:41.272
I can do these same
things to "Mode."

09:41.287 --> 09:43.810
But, Daniel,
your first issue was a big success.

09:43.827 --> 09:45.732
My nephew loved it.

09:45.748 --> 09:47.731
It wasn't my issue,
and you know it.

09:47.748 --> 09:50.523
I mean, Wilhelmina chose every designer,
every article.

09:50.537 --> 09:54.063
I just signed my initials
to lots of memos. I...

09:55.865 --> 09:57.631
That's gonna change.

09:58.745 --> 10:01.112
Set up a staff
meeting for monday--

10:01.126 --> 10:02.511
all department heads,

10:02.528 --> 10:04.300
and work around my
father's schedule.

10:04.318 --> 10:06.452
I want him there, too.

10:07.426 --> 10:10.320
Two words-- fa boo.

10:10.338 --> 10:12.693
It's for that breast
cancer thing at the plaza.

10:12.707 --> 10:15.391
And who's the lucky "plus one"?

10:15.406 --> 10:17.022
The senator's in town.

10:17.038 --> 10:18.910
I thought breast
cancer was pink.

10:18.925 --> 10:22.353
It is, but alzheimer's went
better with the outfit.

10:22.387 --> 10:25.712
What? I'm supporting.
That's what counts.

10:25.728 --> 10:27.102
Zip me.

10:27.117 --> 10:28.742
What do you want, anyhow?

10:28.755 --> 10:30.082
Conference room,

10:30.095 --> 10:31.811
and it's good.

10:31.828 --> 10:34.323
So here are all the models
that Alex worked with,

10:34.336 --> 10:37.233
and I found that font
style that he used.

10:37.245 --> 10:40.533
Um, also, I brought all of
these photographers' books.

10:40.548 --> 10:43.190
This one right here--this is
my favorite. He's amazing.

10:43.208 --> 10:46.180
He's shot everyone from, like,
Madonna to the Dalai Lama.

10:46.197 --> 10:48.202
Yeah, this is
Vincent Bianchi...

10:48.216 --> 10:50.263
and he'll never work for us.

10:50.278 --> 10:51.250
Well, why not?

10:51.268 --> 10:53.640
When he worked with Alex,
they got in this huge blowup.

10:53.658 --> 10:55.120
He thought Alex was a fraud.

10:55.135 --> 10:57.342
Alex thought he was some
temperamental artiste.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.591
He vowed never to work for
Meade Publications again.

11:00.607 --> 11:02.243
But, Daniel, you're not Alex.

11:02.257 --> 11:04.412
Look, if my brother the
wunderkind couldn't make it work,

11:04.446 --> 11:06.842
I seriously doubt
I'd be able to...

11:06.856 --> 11:11.340
Look, let's just, uh,
see who else is here, huh?

11:13.117 --> 11:15.563
Tweedledee and Tweedledumpy have
been in there for two hours

11:15.576 --> 11:18.091
going over back
issues of "Hudson."

11:18.107 --> 11:22.473
Now... he's trying to actually
rip off his own dead brother.

11:22.486 --> 11:26.262
Oh, my god, it couldn't be any
easier if I gave him the gun,

11:26.277 --> 11:28.733
and he aimed it at his foot.

11:35.088 --> 11:39.550
The police released Fey Sommers' car
to a scrape metal yard a week ago.

11:39.567 --> 11:42.313
How come it's taking you so
long to find out where it is?

11:42.328 --> 11:44.041
Location info is private,

11:44.058 --> 11:48.071
and there's over 142 salvage
yards in the Tristate area alone.

11:48.088 --> 11:50.691
Why don't you just go back to your
big building and make magazines,

11:50.728 --> 11:52.080
and  let me do what I do?

11:52.095 --> 11:54.763
Well, you better do
what you do quickly.

11:54.775 --> 11:57.663
The grease monkeys in these garages
can't spell their own names,

11:57.678 --> 11:59.422
but it won't take much
for them to figure out

11:59.455 --> 12:02.051
the steering was tampered with.

12:02.165 --> 12:05.583
And I don't care how good
you think your work is.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.883
What are we drinking to?

12:14.897 --> 12:17.031
To a father who
realizes his child

12:17.046 --> 12:19.120
will never compare
to the one he lost

12:19.137 --> 12:22.240
and to a son who knows
he'll never measure up,

12:22.256 --> 12:24.583
no matter how hard he tries.

12:24.996 --> 12:28.372
It's practically shakespearean.

12:28.385 --> 12:31.272
As long as there's this wedge
between the two of them,

12:31.285 --> 12:33.450
their relationship is doomed.

12:33.467 --> 12:36.931
Daniel's time at the magazine--
and ultimately, the company--

12:36.947 --> 12:38.363
will be limited.

12:38.375 --> 12:44.003
Well, perhaps it's time I drive
that wedge a little deeper.

12:44.015 --> 12:46.872
What would Daniel think
if he were tipped off

12:46.885 --> 12:50.883
as to what his dear old
father were capable of?

13:00.198 --> 13:02.362
Hey, what if we shrink
the magazine down

13:02.376 --> 13:06.013
so women can fit it in
their purses easier?

13:12.457 --> 13:14.873
See, now Alex
would've made that.

13:15.357 --> 13:17.873
He should be the one here doing this,
not me.

13:17.885 --> 13:19.523
At least my father
would be happier.

13:19.538 --> 13:21.503
If your father didn't think
you could do this job,

13:21.538 --> 13:23.923
then why would he
give it to you?

13:25.056 --> 13:29.453
Is this...
kung pao chicken or--or orange beef?

13:29.468 --> 13:33.770
Well, after five hours, Daniel,
I-I don't really think it matters.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.930
You know what next saturday is?

13:36.947 --> 13:39.923
The Harvard/Yale game. Biggest 
college football game of the year.

13:39.938 --> 13:41.923
You want me to try
and get you tickets?

13:41.936 --> 13:43.000
You know,
every year since we were kids,

13:43.038 --> 13:46.492
my father would take Alex to that game.
It was their--their thing.

13:46.517 --> 13:49.293
He never once invited me.

13:52.687 --> 13:55.690
You know,
I actually thought after Alex died,

13:55.705 --> 13:58.312
he was gonna ask
me to go, but...

14:00.685 --> 14:02.811
It's okay. I'm used to it.

14:02.828 --> 14:05.552
Every parent has
a favorite, right?

14:06.496 --> 14:08.590
Well, you know, my dad doesn't.

14:08.605 --> 14:11.221
Sure, he does.
I mean, they all do.

14:11.235 --> 14:15.453
Sometimes it's, uh, something small,
but you can see it, you know?

14:15.466 --> 14:20.462
They, uh, smile a little brighter
when one of you walks in the room...

14:20.475 --> 14:25.183
laugh  a little louder when
one of you tells a joke.

14:37.148 --> 14:38.490
Good morning!

14:38.505 --> 14:40.763
Justin, you are not
gonna make me late today!

14:40.776 --> 14:42.302
What time did you
get in last night?

14:42.317 --> 14:43.891
I don't even remember.

14:43.905 --> 14:46.141
Daniel's going through a bunch
of stuff with his father...

14:46.175 --> 14:47.462
Justin!

14:51.998 --> 14:53.530
What?

14:54.527 --> 14:58.601
Hilda, do you ever think about

14:58.617 --> 15:00.953
dad and us and,

15:00.967 --> 15:03.233
you know, if he has a favorite?

15:03.248 --> 15:04.772
Yeah, I think so.

15:04.787 --> 15:06.953
- You.
- You.

15:06.966 --> 15:09.281
Come on, you're right up
there between Tito Puente

15:09.295 --> 15:11.583
and his nose hair clippers.

15:11.618 --> 15:14.312
I am gonna kill that kid.
Morning, papi.

15:14.327 --> 15:16.320
You didn't get in
till 3:00 last night.

15:16.337 --> 15:17.840
Why they keeping so late?

15:17.856 --> 15:20.110
Well, my boss is trying to make
some changes at the magazine,

15:20.147 --> 15:22.641
and I still have to go through
these photographers' books.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.510
Well, they're
working you too hard.

15:24.528 --> 15:26.163
You tell 'em you want a raise.

15:26.177 --> 15:27.451
Okay, dad.

15:27.466 --> 15:29.050
Vincent Bianchi?

15:29.065 --> 15:30.950
Yeah, he's really amazing.

15:30.966 --> 15:33.102
So he ended up making it
as a photographer, huh?

15:33.118 --> 15:35.053
Damn, I always thought that
kid would end up in jail.

15:35.085 --> 15:36.412
What are you talking about?

15:36.425 --> 15:38.881
Vinnie Bianchi--
he grew up over on Grand.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.110
His family owns
Astoria Lemon Ice.

15:41.127 --> 15:42.851
He grew up four
blocks from here?!

15:42.868 --> 15:46.180
Yeah, his old man's always going
on about his kid's pictures.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.771
He's got a bunch of 'em hanging
up on the wall in there.

15:48.786 --> 15:50.870
Dad, I have to go.
Um, I love you.

15:50.887 --> 15:52.720
I love you, too.

15:54.035 --> 15:56.481
Put down the coffee!

16:02.647 --> 16:05.632
Hello? Hey, someone!

16:07.496 --> 16:09.460
Someone get that!

16:12.448 --> 16:14.730
Anybody else work here?

16:17.566 --> 16:19.002
Bianchi gallery.

16:19.016 --> 16:20.840
Hi, um,
I'm not sure if you can help me,

16:20.858 --> 16:23.020
but I'm trying to
reach Vincent Bianchi.

16:23.036 --> 16:25.562
- You got him.
- Oh, um, okay.

16:25.577 --> 16:26.991
Wow, I wasn't expecting this.

16:27.008 --> 16:30.240
Um... I thought I was gonna
have to leave a message.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.501
You wanna call back?
I could let the machine pick up.

16:32.515 --> 16:34.630
No! No, no. Um, no.

16:34.645 --> 16:38.601
Okay, um, Mr.
Bianchi, I am a really big fan of you.

16:38.616 --> 16:42.582
That cover shoot you did for "Rolling
Stone"-- wow, that was amazing.

16:42.595 --> 16:44.861
Oh, thank you.
You have excellent taste.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.093
How can I help you?

16:46.107 --> 16:49.543
Well, actually, I'm calling about your
availability for a magazine shoot.

16:49.557 --> 16:52.751
Um, you gotta go through my
rep for that--Sheila Cordova.

16:52.765 --> 16:54.731
She handles me for
print work, okay?

16:54.746 --> 16:57.421
You know, you and I--we went
to the same high school.

16:57.435 --> 16:58.350
Huh?

16:58.365 --> 17:01.542
Queensborough High, right?
Class of '93?

17:01.555 --> 17:03.690
- Do I know you?
- No. No, no.

17:03.707 --> 17:05.202
We didn't go at the same time.

17:05.217 --> 17:08.692
Actually, my name is Betty
Suarez--class of 2002--

17:08.708 --> 17:12.080
but it turns out that you and me--we
grew up, like, four blocks from each other.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.652
I live off of Roosevelt.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.761
You're a Jackson
Heights girl, huh?

17:15.777 --> 17:16.901
You don't say.

17:16.917 --> 17:19.431
And I practically live
at Astoria Lemon Ice.

17:19.444 --> 17:21.651
You know that doughnut
place two blocks down?

17:21.666 --> 17:22.880
That's where I grew up.

17:22.895 --> 17:26.671
I-I worked there every summer in
high school, and it burnt down.

17:26.688 --> 17:28.660
Now it's a deli.
It's a pretty good one, but...

17:28.676 --> 17:29.991
Not as good as Sal's,
though, huh?

17:30.026 --> 17:31.720
On 87th? Oh, my gosh,

17:31.736 --> 17:35.092
like, the best sausage and pepper
hero on the eastern seaboard.

17:35.108 --> 17:37.441
Mmm, yeah, just the smell of
those things would get me high.

17:37.475 --> 17:39.553
I haven't thought about
those in a long time.

17:39.568 --> 17:43.090
So, Betty Suarez, okay,
you got me hungry...

17:43.107 --> 17:44.263
and curious.

17:44.277 --> 17:46.502
What is this job you wanted
to talk to me about?

17:46.518 --> 17:48.772
Well, I work at
"Mode" magazine,

17:48.785 --> 17:52.531
and my boss, Daniel Meade,
was wondering--

17:52.547 --> 17:53.943
Hello?

17:53.978 --> 17:57.653
The senator will be picking me up
here for the luncheon on monday.

17:57.668 --> 18:01.532
Before then, I want my
commendations framed and hung--

18:01.547 --> 18:03.782
avanti-classical gold
with a white matte.

18:03.796 --> 18:04.691
White matte.

18:04.705 --> 18:08.363
Put the clio and the women in
publishing on the credenza.

18:08.375 --> 18:09.541
Call phillip.

18:09.557 --> 18:12.862
Order two dozen cherry
black calla lilies

18:12.875 --> 18:14.491
for the coffee table.

18:14.506 --> 18:16.740
Those are his favorites.

18:23.446 --> 18:24.762
Marc!

18:26.838 --> 18:29.210
#  Â¿Por quÃ© me dijiste #

18:29.228 --> 18:31.682
# Que tÃº me amaba #

18:31.698 --> 18:34.562
# Â¿Por quÃ© me
dejaste triste... #

18:36.677 --> 18:39.272
# Â¿Por quÃ© me dijiste #

18:39.288 --> 18:41.912
# Que tÃº me amaba? #

18:41.925 --> 18:47.271
#Â¿Por quÃ© me dejaste
triste y abandonada? #

19:00.986 --> 19:03.473
- Bradford Meade.
- I found it--

19:03.487 --> 19:05.400
Bayonne Salvage Yard.

19:05.415 --> 19:06.533
Did you get rid of it?

19:06.545 --> 19:08.480
That's not gonna be
as easy as I thought.

19:08.495 --> 19:09.282
Why not?

19:09.298 --> 19:10.411
Open your e-mail.

19:10.425 --> 19:12.251
I sent you a little present.

19:15.097 --> 19:18.740
"You can own fashion guru
Fey Sommers' death car."

19:18.756 --> 19:21.423
A sick punk's selling it
to the highest bidder.

19:29.265 --> 19:32.201
See, I'm trying to get
the magazine to attract

19:32.216 --> 19:35.122
a hipper,
more fashion-conscious woman.

19:35.137 --> 19:37.843
So they were out of poppy seed.
I got you onion.

19:37.856 --> 19:40.820
Okay, you're at the newsstand,
500 covers in front of you...

19:40.838 --> 19:42.152
which one of these grabs you?

19:42.166 --> 19:43.842
Bathing suit. It's fresher.

19:43.857 --> 19:46.150
Definitely, and neon is in.

19:46.168 --> 19:49.621
I really like the gown.
It's very Cinderella.

19:49.636 --> 19:52.850
Yeah, listen, could you get
some cream cheese for that?

19:52.867 --> 19:54.553
So...

19:54.746 --> 19:56.473
I'm trying to get this font.

19:56.485 --> 19:59.581
I was trying to go for
something cool and sexy.

20:06.058 --> 20:08.051
Daniel Meade.

20:08.395 --> 20:09.921
Who's calling?

20:09.936 --> 20:11.631
Betty?

20:11.898 --> 20:14.242
Vincent Bianchi's
on line three...

20:14.258 --> 20:15.361
for you.

20:15.377 --> 20:16.990
Really?

20:17.268 --> 20:19.181
Hello?

20:19.496 --> 20:23.002
Oh, you did. I'm so glad.

20:23.016 --> 20:24.891
Well, you know, I just--
I thought that

20:24.906 --> 20:28.510
it was probably a while since
you've gotten down to Sal's, so...

20:28.527 --> 20:30.601
Are you serious?

20:30.617 --> 20:34.700
Oh, my god, that would be 
so wonderful, Mr. Bianchi.

20:34.956 --> 20:37.651
Okay, Vincent.

20:38.385 --> 20:41.753
Oh, yeah, yeah, that was--that was
my boss who picked up. Hold on.

20:41.768 --> 20:44.620
He said he loved the sausage and
pepper heroes that I sent him.

20:44.638 --> 20:46.663
He thought I had cojones.
I'll explain later.

20:46.675 --> 20:48.743
Just go pick up the phone.

20:54.447 --> 20:55.841
Well...

20:57.816 --> 21:00.203
I don't really
know what you did,

21:00.218 --> 21:03.202
or how sausage and
peppers helped, but...

21:03.215 --> 21:06.833
thank you,
and we're having lunch on monday.

21:07.435 --> 21:09.633
Well, would you like me
to set up a reservation?

21:09.646 --> 21:13.213
Yeah, um, actually, see if you
can get us a table at Madison Six.

21:13.227 --> 21:14.821
And, uh, make it for three.

21:14.837 --> 21:16.880
He asked that you come along.

21:16.896 --> 21:18.200
What?

21:18.216 --> 21:19.802
Wait, wait, wait,
he asked for me?

21:19.815 --> 21:22.712
Oh, and, uh,
maybe we could both...

21:22.728 --> 21:25.242
dress up a little on monday?

21:29.497 --> 21:32.823
I think he meant
natural fibers, sweetie.

21:34.656 --> 21:36.823
Come on, Christina,
there's gotta be something.

21:36.836 --> 21:39.720
A sweater or a jacket?

21:39.785 --> 21:42.731
I can't walk in there
looking like me.

21:43.808 --> 21:45.130
You look fine.

21:45.145 --> 21:46.910
But you're not Vincent Bianchi.

21:46.925 --> 21:49.521
He's expecting one of
these "28th floor girls."

21:49.538 --> 21:50.901
And since when did you want
to look like one of them?

21:50.937 --> 21:52.091
They're not even real!

21:52.107 --> 21:54.003
Real women snort
when they laugh,

21:54.017 --> 21:56.453
they've got fat asses,
wobbly upper arms

21:56.468 --> 21:58.080
and get P.M.S.

21:58.096 --> 22:00.181
I thought you wanted to
run a magazine someday,

22:00.198 --> 22:03.092
not spend 12 hours a day wondering
about what your hair's doing.

22:03.106 --> 22:06.053
Yeah, but this job is the only
chance I have of ever getting there.

22:06.066 --> 22:07.531
I was in Daniel's
office earlier,

22:07.548 --> 22:09.851
and he wanted the
opinion of a "Mode" girl.

22:09.865 --> 22:11.940
He didn't look at me.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.532
So you honestly think that
I have any future here

22:14.546 --> 22:17.313
if I don't at least
try to change?

22:17.946 --> 22:19.953
Never mind.

22:32.056 --> 22:34.620
Betty, what are you doing?

22:35.378 --> 22:37.343
What's going on?

22:38.787 --> 22:41.161
I work in an office
full of glamazon women

22:41.177 --> 22:44.213
who are all 6 feet tall
and perfectly waxed.

22:44.227 --> 22:46.303
That's what's going on.

22:47.857 --> 22:49.633
"Glamazon"?

22:49.648 --> 22:51.470
Never mind.

22:52.117 --> 22:55.423
Hey, come here.

22:56.356 --> 23:00.060
Since when does that kind
of stuff get to you?

23:00.338 --> 23:02.310
Hey.

23:02.478 --> 23:05.982
Amor, you are so beautiful.

23:05.996 --> 23:08.771
Dad, stop.
Please don't even try that.

23:08.785 --> 23:12.421
- And you have such a big heart--
- And stop it with the "big heart."

23:12.437 --> 23:16.832
The speech didn't work when I was
cast as a rock in the school play,

23:16.848 --> 23:20.022
or when I was sitting at home
with you and mom on prom night,

23:20.035 --> 23:22.130
and it's not gonna
work now, so...

23:22.145 --> 23:24.943
Betty, you'll always
be my special girl.

23:24.957 --> 23:27.013
You know that.

23:31.756 --> 23:33.722
Just so you know,

23:33.737 --> 23:38.370
you were a really
terrific rock.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.372
Dad, don't forget
to take your pill.

23:44.398 --> 23:46.041
Okay.

23:48.468 --> 23:49.873
See?

23:49.885 --> 23:51.613
Shut up.

23:52.337 --> 23:54.433
Just help me.

24:00.537 --> 24:02.843
She has a 2:00 with Choli.

24:04.587 --> 24:07.140
I have a 2:00 with Jean-Luc.

24:08.028 --> 24:10.333
Mama!

24:10.978 --> 24:12.912
Choli...

24:14.447 --> 24:18.712
So what are we thinking today?

24:18.725 --> 24:22.200
Something befitting
an editor in chief.

24:22.217 --> 24:24.920
No... you get the job?

24:24.935 --> 24:28.643
Soon. Very soon.

24:28.658 --> 24:31.530
So do you think you could
really make me look like this?

24:31.545 --> 24:35.342
Honey, you sit back and relax
and let Choli do her thing.

24:36.046 --> 24:38.570
We gon' need the big tweezers.

24:57.328 --> 24:58.830
Thank you.

25:13.496 --> 25:15.543
Perfect.

25:15.558 --> 25:17.671
Are you sure I look like this?

25:17.686 --> 25:20.951
Baby, you look better.

25:29.958 --> 25:31.972
# Ladies up in here tonight #

25:31.985 --> 25:33.573
# No fightin' #

25:33.585 --> 25:36.061
# We got the refugees in here #
# No fightin' #

25:36.645 --> 25:39.761
# No fightin' #
# Shakira, Shakira #

25:39.775 --> 25:41.933
# I never really knew that
she could dance like this #

25:41.947 --> 25:44.273
# She make a man want
to sing spanish #

25:44.285 --> 25:45.851
# Â¿CÃ³mo se llama? #
# SÃ­ #

25:45.865 --> 25:47.062
# Bonita #
# SÃ­ #

25:47.077 --> 25:49.592
# Mi casa, su casa #
# Shakira, Shakira... #

25:49.607 --> 25:50.941
Betty?

25:50.956 --> 25:53.473
Dude, how could you have
broken up with her?

25:53.487 --> 25:55.662
She--she's hot.

25:58.368 --> 26:00.001
Me?

26:00.138 --> 26:01.741
Really?

26:01.756 --> 26:03.680
Thank you!

26:03.748 --> 26:06.122
# All the attraction,
the tension #

26:06.136 --> 26:08.420
# Don't you see, baby,
this is perfection? #

26:08.437 --> 26:11.730
# Hey, girl,
I can see your body moving #

26:11.748 --> 26:13.481
# And it's driving me crazy #

26:13.496 --> 26:16.612
# And I didn't have
the slightest idea... #

26:16.628 --> 26:18.213
Penthouse, please.

26:18.227 --> 26:19.830
Yes, sir.

26:30.287 --> 26:32.922
Oh, Mr. Meade! Hi.

26:32.937 --> 26:36.892
How are you?
I'm Betty, Daniel's assistant.

26:36.906 --> 26:40.113
Oh, yeah, yeah. You look...

26:40.786 --> 26:42.093
taller.

26:42.108 --> 26:43.791
Thank you.

26:44.705 --> 26:47.210
# Reading the
signs of my body #

26:47.228 --> 26:48.702
# And I'm on tonight #

26:48.716 --> 26:50.303
# You know my hips don't lie #

26:50.316 --> 26:52.363
# And I am starting
to feel you boy #

26:52.406 --> 26:55.773
Excuse me. I'm going to have
to call you right back.

26:56.816 --> 26:59.690
# Oh I know I am on tonight #
# My hips don't lie #

26:59.705 --> 27:03.760
# And I'm starting to feel it's right #
Betty? Oh, ho.

27:03.775 --> 27:07.061
I think I just found
my new screen saver.

27:08.245 --> 27:10.483
Daniel Meade's office.

27:11.086 --> 27:13.290
Excuse me. Who's calling?

27:13.355 --> 27:16.542
Um, just one second.

27:17.446 --> 27:18.593
Yep?

27:18.605 --> 27:20.993
Daniel, there's a woman on line
two who won't tell me her name,

27:21.028 --> 27:23.160
but she says she wants to talk
to you about your father.

27:23.195 --> 27:26.241
Oh, just get rid of her.
No. Uh, wait.

27:26.847 --> 27:28.580
Daniel Meade here.

27:28.595 --> 27:30.640
Hello, Daniel.

27:30.656 --> 27:32.873
I just finished
your first issue.

27:32.885 --> 27:35.310
You should be very pleased.

27:35.327 --> 27:36.632
Who is this?

27:36.646 --> 27:39.751
Oh, that's not
important right now.

27:39.767 --> 27:43.902
The real question is,
how well do you know your father?

27:44.135 --> 27:45.190
Excuse me?

27:45.208 --> 27:47.200
Do yourself a favor.

27:47.215 --> 27:51.551
Ask him what he's been up to
at the Bayonne Salvage Yard.

27:56.428 --> 27:59.133
What the hell is
that supp--whoa.

27:59.565 --> 28:01.612
Look at you.

28:01.895 --> 28:05.593
Yep. You told me to dress
up for our lunch today.

28:05.605 --> 28:08.950
Yeah, and dress
up you did. Yeah.

28:09.805 --> 28:12.502
Um, you know what? I was thinking
maybe we should call Madison Six,

28:12.516 --> 28:13.840
see if they have a
table in the back,

28:13.875 --> 28:16.970
just so we can have a little
privacy with Bianchi.

28:16.985 --> 28:19.201
- Okay.
- Great.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.733
Have you seen her yet?

28:33.747 --> 28:37.492
Yes, I did,
and it looks as if Queens threw up.

28:40.887 --> 28:43.890
He should be quite impressed.

28:43.955 --> 28:47.890
Ooh! Someone got
their hair did.

28:48.945 --> 28:52.761
So I'm pitching we go
for an entire redesign.

28:52.786 --> 28:55.371
Splashier colors,
bolder looks...

28:55.387 --> 28:57.442
overhaul the entire layout.

28:57.455 --> 28:59.282
It can be a whole new "Mode."

28:59.298 --> 29:01.413
Stop using, you know,
the same old models.

29:01.427 --> 29:04.380
Get cutting-edge photographers,
more interesting writers.

29:04.398 --> 29:09.433
I mean, do we really need another
editorial on eating disorders?

29:13.698 --> 29:16.542
Now... I happen, uh,
to be having lunch today

29:16.556 --> 29:19.562
- with Vincent Bianchi to discuss--
- Vincent Bianchi?

29:19.577 --> 29:21.811
You expect him to do
a spread for "Mode"?

29:21.827 --> 29:23.621
You know his history
with the company.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.333
Your brother couldn't
work with him.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.601
Why do you even try?

29:30.016 --> 29:32.140
Because he's one of the best,

29:32.157 --> 29:34.771
and I think I can persuade
him to consider it.

29:34.788 --> 29:36.783
Daniel, I for one,
think it's wonderful

29:36.796 --> 29:40.141
you've taken such
initiative at the magazine,

29:40.157 --> 29:42.491
but some of these changes
you're suggesting...

29:42.507 --> 29:44.722
uh, let me put it this way.

29:44.737 --> 29:47.852
Uh, sometimes change
is a positive thing,

29:47.867 --> 29:51.573
and then sometimes, well,
they can spin out of control.

29:51.586 --> 29:53.383
You start with a
simple redesign,

29:53.395 --> 29:55.532
and all of a sudden,
before you know it,

29:55.547 --> 30:00.572
you're talking about bold new
colors and a daring new look,

30:00.587 --> 30:04.310
and the truth is,
you haven't really improved on a thing.

30:04.326 --> 30:07.001
- Wilhelmina--
- I'm just saying,

30:07.015 --> 30:09.230
change isn't always
for the better.

30:09.246 --> 30:13.881
In some cases, it can make 
a bad situation even worse.

30:35.535 --> 30:37.682
This is the ladies room.

30:37.756 --> 30:40.140
I wanted to make
sure you were okay.

30:40.155 --> 30:42.110
It's just another
day at "Mode."

30:42.125 --> 30:44.793
You can't listen to a
thing Wilhelmina says.

30:44.807 --> 30:48.781
- She's a jerk.
- No, Daniel. I'm the jerk.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.941
Thinking that fake
nails and a new hairdo

30:51.955 --> 30:55.121
could actually make a
difference on someone like me.

30:55.295 --> 30:57.011
Okay.

30:57.648 --> 30:59.892
Yeah, look... um...

31:01.726 --> 31:04.793
I-I don't know what I'm
supposed to tell you.

31:05.075 --> 31:07.820
This is the way
this place works.

31:07.838 --> 31:09.993
It is a fashion magazine.

31:10.008 --> 31:11.673
Appearance--

31:11.688 --> 31:13.652
it means something here.

31:13.668 --> 31:15.432
I know.

31:16.676 --> 31:21.363
Listen, I know you're going to feel
a whole lot better after our lunch.

31:21.638 --> 31:23.752
You can order
anything you want.

31:23.767 --> 31:25.421
No, I'm not going.

31:25.437 --> 31:28.133
What? No, no. You have to go.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.630
Betty, Bianchi
wants to meet you.

31:29.645 --> 31:31.880
You're the whole reason this
lunch is even happening.

31:31.896 --> 31:34.090
Daniel, he doesn't
even know who I am.

31:34.107 --> 31:35.652
Just take Amanda.

31:35.667 --> 31:38.711
It's like you said--appearance
means something.

31:38.727 --> 31:40.860
She'll fit right
in at Madison Six.

31:40.877 --> 31:42.061
Betty, come on.

31:42.076 --> 31:45.001
Daniel, just go.
You're gonna be late.

31:45.025 --> 31:47.791
And don't forget the proposal.

32:06.498 --> 32:10.020
About time.
How long does it take to put on makeup?

32:10.986 --> 32:13.803
Well, I also had
to fix my hair.

32:14.076 --> 32:16.070
Thought you were Amanda.

32:16.087 --> 32:18.212
I didn't know you'd
be joining us.

32:18.227 --> 32:21.642
Afraid I might botch things up
with Bianchi if I were on my own?

32:21.657 --> 32:26.732
Let's just say that I had a sudden
craving for the quail at Madison Six.

32:30.955 --> 32:32.320
Okay.

32:32.338 --> 32:34.730
Betty Suarez is here.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.500
Shall we?

32:52.607 --> 32:54.411
He called.

32:54.425 --> 32:56.842
He's running late
to pick you up.

32:56.856 --> 33:00.710
Well, a senator's life can
never be called his own.

33:00.727 --> 33:05.010
Be sure to meet him
downstairs to escort him up.

33:10.668 --> 33:12.942
Vincent. Daniel Meade.
Sorry we're late.

33:12.955 --> 33:14.322
Ah, no problem.

33:14.338 --> 33:17.910
Just killing time, trying to figure
out what these five forks are for.

33:17.925 --> 33:19.233
Bradford Meade.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.980
I remember you, yeah.

33:20.995 --> 33:23.802
And this is Betty Suarez.

33:23.817 --> 33:25.781
Ho-la.

33:47.758 --> 33:49.752
The quail here is excellent.

33:49.766 --> 33:53.101
Quail! Could you hear 'em
in the old neighborhood,

33:53.116 --> 33:55.992
if they saw us in
a place like this?

33:56.775 --> 33:59.642
Oh... carbs. No.

34:03.088 --> 34:08.033
But, uh, who cares about carbs
when you're from Queens, right?

34:09.447 --> 34:13.469
Excuse me. I'm going to need a
very large glass of wine, please.

34:15.467 --> 34:18.190
Is this color peach or salmon?

34:18.208 --> 34:20.552
Marc! Marc, will you cover 
my phones for me, please?

34:20.567 --> 34:23.152
- Daniel forgot the proposal--
- Oh, I'll bring it to the restaurant.

34:23.187 --> 34:24.630
No, I'll take it to him.
It's my job.

34:24.668 --> 34:27.612
Oh, come on. They won't even let
you past the host at Madison Six.

34:27.628 --> 34:29.810
Ah-ah. Just let me. I got it.

34:29.826 --> 34:31.962
Marc, give it to me!

34:31.978 --> 34:33.739
I can't hit your boss,
but I can hit you.

34:33.757 --> 34:37.051
And everybody knows I'm from Queens,
so I will do it!

34:38.255 --> 34:39.821
Thank you.

34:45.097 --> 34:47.491
So none of the girls
looked like you

34:47.505 --> 34:50.061
when I went to
Queensborough High.

34:50.338 --> 34:54.192
Hey, does Mrs.
Rodriguez still teach there?

34:54.206 --> 34:57.139
I'm gonna say...

34:58.338 --> 34:59.861
she died.

35:11.825 --> 35:17.202
So you're still just
a creative director?

35:17.936 --> 35:20.162
Yes, daddy.

35:21.096 --> 35:22.790
Shall we?

35:29.428 --> 35:32.232
So, uh, we feel 
this holiday issue is our chance

35:32.247 --> 35:35.513
to try something really out
there for our feature spread.

35:35.526 --> 35:38.851
4-page pullout. You would have
total carte blanche, of course.

35:38.866 --> 35:41.321
So what does your
old man do, anyway?

35:41.336 --> 35:43.632
Investment banker.

35:43.927 --> 35:46.792
Your father's an investment
banker... Betty?

35:46.805 --> 35:51.190
Oh. I mean, yeah.
That was always his dream.

35:51.206 --> 35:55.252
You know, if he ever 
made it out of the Bare-Rio.

35:55.266 --> 35:56.650
What?

35:56.665 --> 35:59.200
- Okay, that it's it. It's over.
- Daniel...

35:59.218 --> 36:01.413
Look, I can't keep
doing this, dad.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.190
I'm sorry, Mr. Bianchi.

36:03.207 --> 36:04.342
Are you ready to
hear the specials?

36:04.375 --> 36:05.760
Actually, could you hold
off on the specials?

36:05.797 --> 36:09.263
I'm about to blow a very,
uh, big deal here.

36:09.276 --> 36:11.273
Mr. Bianchi...

36:11.286 --> 36:13.992
this is not Betty Suarez.

36:14.236 --> 36:15.962
Hmm?

36:19.425 --> 36:20.770
No kidding.

36:20.785 --> 36:22.643
Come on. Give me some credit.

36:22.656 --> 36:26.261
This girl's never been within 10 feet of
a sausage and pepper hero in her life.

36:26.277 --> 36:28.023
He is so right.

36:28.036 --> 36:30.012
So where's the girl I
talked to on the phone?

36:30.026 --> 36:31.342
She didn't want to come,

36:31.358 --> 36:32.941
and it's my fault.

36:32.957 --> 36:35.181
And she was looking forward
to meeting you very much.

36:35.198 --> 36:38.921
But because we're all caught
up with some stupid image,

36:38.938 --> 36:41.803
I made her feel insecure about
fitting into a place like this.

36:41.816 --> 36:44.731
He's my boss. I just need to--I
need to take him the envelope.

36:44.747 --> 36:46.591
He's right there.
It's just 10 feet in.

36:46.608 --> 36:49.660
I can't imagine why you
thought she wouldn't fit in.

36:50.348 --> 36:52.113
Look, here he comes.
He'll tell you.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.601
I'm so sorry, Mr. Meade.
She says that she's with you.

36:54.615 --> 36:55.781
She is.

36:55.796 --> 36:57.980
Look, sir. You just--you
forgot the layout proposal.

36:57.998 --> 37:00.011
There's someone I want you to meet.
Come here.

37:03.815 --> 37:06.541
Now this must be Betty Suarez.

37:06.557 --> 37:09.041
Mr. Bianchi. Hi.

37:09.056 --> 37:10.761
It's really an honor.

37:10.777 --> 37:12.232
Really.

37:12.247 --> 37:14.250
Look, Mr. Bianchi,

37:14.266 --> 37:17.592
between your fight with my brother and
what we just tried to pull off here,

37:17.608 --> 37:19.813
I'm sure there isn't a reason in
hell you'd want to work with us,

37:19.846 --> 37:22.561
but I gotta say, I--

37:22.578 --> 37:25.253
I think it'd be a great
opportunity for both of us.

37:25.267 --> 37:27.593
You would have free rein
to call your own shots.

37:27.605 --> 37:28.722
I give you my word.

37:28.737 --> 37:31.613
Actually, I give
you Betty's word.

37:31.627 --> 37:34.741
She's the only one who's been
straight with you so far.

37:39.347 --> 37:41.812
You know,
you're nothing like your brother.

37:41.825 --> 37:44.992
No. I'm not.

37:46.518 --> 37:48.580
I'm not Alex.

37:49.848 --> 37:52.052
I'll leave you
with the proposal.

37:52.065 --> 37:54.032
Mr. Bianchi.

37:56.677 --> 37:58.631
Here you go.

37:58.746 --> 38:00.440
Thanks.

38:07.406 --> 38:10.351
Excuse me.
Could I get a matchbook, please?

38:10.365 --> 38:12.860
My nephew is never
gonna believe this.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.541
Awesome. Thanks.

38:19.875 --> 38:22.263
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

38:22.278 --> 38:25.381
I should have insisted you
come to lunch with me today.

38:25.478 --> 38:28.272
Well, Daniel,
I'm sorry that I backed down.

38:28.287 --> 38:31.741
I mean, I should not have let
Wilhelmina get to me like that.

38:31.755 --> 38:34.620
Look, fake nails or not,
you came through for us, Betty.

38:34.635 --> 38:36.722
Bianchi was only
there because of you.

38:36.737 --> 38:39.953
I guess you really do
have cojones, huh?

38:41.556 --> 38:43.623
So I'm going to go.

38:48.117 --> 38:50.311
- He's doing it.
- We got him?

38:50.325 --> 38:51.601
We got him.

38:51.615 --> 38:54.681
His one stipulation is that
he answers only to you

38:54.697 --> 38:58.002
and to no other "blowhards."

38:58.016 --> 38:59.832
Okay.

39:01.558 --> 39:06.380
Betty, uh, please send 
an e-mail to all creative.

39:06.396 --> 39:10.932
"Vincent Bianchi will be shooting
our december feature spread."

39:10.948 --> 39:13.233
Shut up!

39:13.408 --> 39:15.523
Right away, sir.

39:17.206 --> 39:19.172
Congratulations.

39:19.186 --> 39:21.031
Thank you.

39:23.335 --> 39:28.203
Dad, I got a weird
call from some woman.

39:28.217 --> 39:32.063
She said to ask you about
Bayonne scrape yard.

39:32.366 --> 39:34.433
Mean anything?

39:34.448 --> 39:36.472
I haven't the foggiest.

39:36.488 --> 39:39.380
Must be some kind of crank.

39:39.398 --> 39:42.953
I've never even
been to Bayonne.

39:59.015 --> 40:03.052
Vincent Bianchi will
be shooting december?

40:03.068 --> 40:04.963
He got him?

40:04.975 --> 40:06.543
Damn!

40:32.638 --> 40:35.581
Hey, look who's home
in time for dinner.

40:35.595 --> 40:37.482
What happened to your makeup

40:37.497 --> 40:39.242
and your nails?

40:39.255 --> 40:40.730
It was kind a long day.

40:40.747 --> 40:41.993
They didn't fire you, did they?

40:42.007 --> 40:43.191
'Cause I'll go down there.

40:43.207 --> 40:45.780
No, dad, they didn't fire me.

40:45.796 --> 40:48.960
In fact, because of me,

40:48.977 --> 40:52.472
we landed Vincent Bianchi
for a big magazine shoot.

40:52.487 --> 40:54.042
That's a big deal?

40:54.057 --> 40:55.462
I could've gotten you that kid.

40:55.475 --> 40:58.010
Yes, dad,
it's kind of a big deal.

40:58.025 --> 41:01.310
It's a really big deal.

41:01.325 --> 41:03.803
Well, in that case...

41:05.097 --> 41:06.720
I'm very proud of you.

41:06.737 --> 41:08.500
Thank you.

41:12.507 --> 41:13.911
And you know what?

41:13.927 --> 41:15.720
If it wasn't for
Hilda's makeover,

41:15.738 --> 41:17.841
none of it would
have even happened.

41:17.856 --> 41:19.753
Hey, how about that?

41:19.768 --> 41:21.811
Ah, my two girls.

41:23.515 --> 41:25.440
Betty, it's all set up.

41:25.455 --> 41:27.250
Where you going?
We're about to eat.

41:27.267 --> 41:30.060
Hilda, this is one club
they can't keep me out of.

41:30.075 --> 41:32.182
# Dance revolution #

41:32.196 --> 41:35.203
# Keep ya body movin' #

41:38.235 --> 41:39.890
# Now first things first #

41:39.905 --> 41:41.540
# Ain't no time to rehearse #

41:41.558 --> 41:44.150
# Put your back foot forward #

41:44.165 --> 41:46.563

41:57.318 --> 41:59.571
