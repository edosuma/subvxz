Gustavo, nice boots.

I haven't seen you
in a couple of days.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.412

00:18.286 --> 00:19.487
I don't know where he is.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.089
We have to talk.

You can't do it alone.

I'm not alone.

we were there?

No, she met some guys and left with them.
What guys?

He kinda looked like, like,
a Latino Freddie Mercury.

-We just cruisin'.

What'd he say?

14:31.705 --> 14:35.442

14:35.475 --> 14:39.847
They was on their way,
and, you know, and Leon...

14:39.880 --> 14:41.782
I had to think fast, Mel.

14:41.815 --> 14:44.885
I couldn't risk 'em
searching my house.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.957
So...

14:49.990 --> 14:52.292
you gonna risk my ass

14:52.325 --> 14:54.294
by bringing that shit
into my crib?

14:54.327 --> 14:56.697
I couldn't see any other way.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.866
(exhales sharply)

14:58.899 --> 15:00.467

down with me.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.071
And I thought you actually
cared about me.

15:06.674 --> 15:08.141
But you can't see
anything else

15:08.175 --> 15:10.644
besides what's in
that fucking bag.

15:10.678 --> 15:13.146
I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen again.
No. Franklin, just go.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.381
Just -- don't touch me.
It's --

15:14.414 --> 15:16.316
Get out. Get out of my house.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.552

15:43.043 --> 15:46.179
Okay. (sighs)
(door creaks)

15:46.213 --> 15:48.682
How about you?
Yeah. Okay.

15:48.716 --> 15:50.751
What's goin' on?

15:50.784 --> 15:55.355
Oh, um, actually,
I just wanted to, uh...

15:55.388 --> 15:57.524
I just wanted to get you
something.

15:57.557 --> 16:01.028
What is it? You know, it's to
thank you for all of your help.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.196
No, you don't -- you don't
have to do that.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.198
It's from "Harvey."

16:05.232 --> 16:07.367
You know, that one with
the giant invisible rabbit

16:07.400 --> 16:10.037
that only Jimmy Stewart
can see, so...

16:10.070 --> 16:11.872
I can't accept this.

16:11.905 --> 16:14.708
Oh, no. I insist.

16:14.742 --> 16:18.712
I mean, you've been the one
bright spot in all of this.

16:18.746 --> 16:20.881
So...

16:20.914 --> 16:24.284
Yeah. Especially when I was
throwing up everywhere

16:24.317 --> 16:27.621
and getting punched in the face.
(laughs) Yeah.

16:27.655 --> 16:30.658
Uh, yeah. Especially then.
(chuckles)

16:32.092 --> 16:35.763

16:37.430 --> 16:41.068
I can't keep doing this
for much longer.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.137
At a certain point, I just
have to accept that she's, uh...

16:46.106 --> 16:47.941
...that she's gone, you know?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.578

16:54.614 --> 16:56.917

anybody else would have.

16:56.950 --> 17:00.320
Well, I don't know
if that's true, but...

17:00.353 --> 17:01.955

17:04.357 --> 17:06.326

18:03.250 --> 18:05.385
Well, you and Jerome always
lock, step, and barrel

18:05.418 --> 18:08.488

All right, all right, okay.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.829

personally,

18:15.863 --> 18:19.666

Franklin ain't here.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.262

18:49.296 --> 18:51.031
No, it ain't.

18:51.064 --> 18:54.201
I should've never let him
quit college.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.870
Throwing away all
the advantages I gave him.

18:56.904 --> 19:00.874
Nah, you was happy
to have him back home.

19:00.908 --> 19:03.210
My brother was happy
to have him slinging.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.045
Your brother ain't been doing
nothing but trying

19:05.078 --> 19:07.214
to keep that boy straight.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.717
Franklin is the one
that's been pushing ahead.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.886
It's even been causing some
problems in our home,

19:12.920 --> 19:14.554

19:14.587 --> 19:18.792

Franklin for droppin' out.

the one person who should be

19:28.768 --> 19:31.738
thinkin' real hard about
her own choices.

cracker-ass slumlord --

19:38.278 --> 19:40.413

19:40.447 --> 19:42.082
You better stop right
motherfucking there.

19:42.115 --> 19:43.917
...and thanking him
for the crumbs off the table.

19:43.951 --> 19:48.255
Are you tryin' to take
the high road with me?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.323
