00:02.870 --> 00:04.538
There's a lot of things you do
when you have a daughter

00:04.605 --> 00:06.240
that you never
pictured yourself doing.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.709
This is so much cuter
now that I took in the waist.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.544
Little by little,
you start to change.

00:10.611 --> 00:13.214
Okay, Hope, who do you
think wore it better?

00:13.281 --> 00:16.217
Jessica Biel or Lea Michele?

00:18.552 --> 00:20.088
(scoffs)
You're crazy.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.455
And before you know it,

00:21.522 --> 00:23.457
you're just not the same guy
you used to be.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.359
You know, girls,
I think I like making them

00:25.426 --> 00:26.760
almost as much as eating them.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.062
Am I right?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.797
And the weird part is,

00:29.863 --> 00:31.599
you don't even realize
you've changed

00:31.665 --> 00:33.767
until someone
finally calls you out on it.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.037
Stop being a girl.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.274
* Whoo! *

00:40.341 --> 00:44.645
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

00:44.712 --> 00:46.847
I'm not saying to stop
being a great dad.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.483
Just butch it up
a little.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.685
You don't want other guys
seeing you do this stuff.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.421
You don't want girls
seeing you do it.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.356
You think Sabrina
wants to be with a guy

00:55.423 --> 00:56.857
who cries
at cell phone commercials?

00:56.924 --> 00:58.126
It's just that one.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.460
The guy finds
a teddy bear

00:59.527 --> 01:01.529
his daughter put in
his suitcase, and...

01:01.595 --> 01:03.397
he calls her
all the way from China.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.899
Oh, you're a mess, dude.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.568
Women like
sensitive guys.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.170
(scoffs)
Where'd you hear that?

01:09.237 --> 01:10.438
Mom.
Please.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.840
Women think they like
sensitive men.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.576
But they also want someone
with a little bit of danger.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.412
I'm not saying you got to be
a ten on the macho scale.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.514
I mean, your patchy beard
growth rules that out.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.150
But you used
to be a seven.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.484
Ever since the
baby came along,

01:23.551 --> 01:25.419
you've been moving
down to about a five.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.421
That's just above
Rosie O'Donnell.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.922
You think that's what
Sabrina's looking for?

01:28.989 --> 01:30.324
I don't know.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.226
What number are you?
I'm an eight.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.527
It's the perfect
number for a man.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.296
I have a little
bit of sensitivity

01:35.363 --> 01:37.064
because I play guitar,
and my love of daiquiris.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.866
That, and you have
a rating system for men.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.000
Exactly.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.569
But your mom fell
in love with me

01:41.635 --> 01:43.137
because I also have
my dangerous side.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.005
I smuggle fireworks
across the border.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.507
I give cops a
lot of lip.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.442
I dry-humped the school
mascot at homecoming.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.678
Your mother claims she
hated that kind of stuff,

01:50.744 --> 01:52.946
but hey, she let
me knock her up.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.682
JIMMY: Well, I'm not going
to become a smuggler,

01:54.748 --> 01:56.116
or talk back to cops
or hump mascots.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.585
BURT:
Well, you got to find

01:57.651 --> 01:59.052
your own thing, then--
something dangerous

01:59.119 --> 02:00.621
that she'll want
to hear about.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.790
You got to get your
edge back, man.

02:02.856 --> 02:03.891
I haven't lost my edge.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.659
It was a windy day
outside the black church,

02:05.726 --> 02:07.060
so I got a couple
of good ones.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.362
I'll go make

02:08.429 --> 02:10.364
your virgin mint juleps.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.532
Our pretty little ponies
are running

02:11.599 --> 02:12.766
in the Pretty Little
Kentucky Derby later.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.870
Maybe I've lost
a bit of my edge.

02:16.937 --> 02:17.905
(tray clangs)

02:24.912 --> 02:27.381
What are you doing up there?

02:27.448 --> 02:29.650
Just having my lunch break
where it's dangerous.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.285
Guess I'm kind of a daredevil.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.653
I guess so.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.356
Well, I like
living on the edge.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.424
And, apparently, I'm not

02:36.490 --> 02:38.025
the first person
to have lunch up here.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.227
There's raisins on this beam.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.062
(spits)

02:42.129 --> 02:44.064
Not a raisin.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.399
James, James, James!

02:45.466 --> 02:46.534
Do we all need
to watch

02:46.600 --> 02:48.369
the company's work
safety video again?

02:48.436 --> 02:50.971
I would like to cordially
invite you both

02:51.038 --> 02:52.306
to my uncle's party tonight.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.375
BARNEY:
Oh, uh, I can't.

02:54.442 --> 02:57.211
Uh, I'm, uh,
waxing my floors,

02:57.278 --> 02:58.679
my, uh, car,

02:58.746 --> 03:00.080
my skis, my legs.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.850
(stammering): I have a lot
of wax I need to get rid of.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.752
What about you, Sabrina?

03:04.818 --> 03:05.919
Oh, I can't.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.021
I have really bad
diarrhea.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.257
Well, that's a shame

03:09.323 --> 03:10.691
'cause we're going
to get some beer

03:10.758 --> 03:12.693
and blow stuff up
in the park.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.231
SABRINA: You're so lucky
he didn't look up.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.699
You didn't even have
to make up an excuse.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.368
And now I have to go
wax my legs

03:20.434 --> 03:22.002
'cause you can
bet Frank will be

03:22.069 --> 03:24.272
checking my
calves tomorrow.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.806
SABRINA:
I don't understand why

03:25.873 --> 03:27.641
anybody would want to go
to Frank's party.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.976
I mean, it just
sounds dangerous.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.578
Dangerous, huh?

03:30.644 --> 03:32.546
Hey, Frank,
what time is that party?

03:32.613 --> 03:33.747
I'm in.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.184
I don't like
the idea of you

03:37.251 --> 03:38.252
blowing stuff
up with Frank.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.587
He's creepy.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.322
You know,
he gets this from you.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.390
This is like
one of those

03:42.456 --> 03:44.592
idiot things
you did in high school.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.228
You know what's one of the idiot
things she did in high school?

03:48.296 --> 03:49.597
Me.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.198
'Cause I'm dangerous.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.901
Go get 'em,
danger boy!

03:53.967 --> 03:55.836
(hushed): Ah! Ah!

04:05.746 --> 04:07.348
Jimmy!

04:07.415 --> 04:09.850
You ready to blow
something up?

04:09.917 --> 04:13.153
Uh, I think I'm just
going to watch things first.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.688
All right,
watch the master.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.592
(air hissing)

04:19.560 --> 04:21.729
So this is blowing
things up?

04:21.795 --> 04:24.432
Do you blow them up
until they explode?

04:24.498 --> 04:27.435
No, dude.
Just till you get dizzy.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.640
(air hissing, toy squeaking)

04:38.946 --> 04:40.748
MAN: Yeah!

04:43.351 --> 04:44.318
MAN: Oh yeah!
(indistinct hollering)

04:44.385 --> 04:46.387
(air hissing)

04:46.454 --> 04:48.789
(inhales loudly)

04:48.856 --> 04:49.790
(toy squeaks)

04:49.857 --> 04:51.291
(man laughing)

04:51.359 --> 04:53.761
(softly snoring)

05:02.936 --> 05:04.438
FRANK:
Morning.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.507
You want eggs or toast
for breakfast?

05:06.574 --> 05:08.342
But keep in mind,
if you say eggs,

05:08.409 --> 05:09.543
you're going
to be disappointed.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.379
What's going on?

05:11.445 --> 05:13.013
Where am I?

05:13.080 --> 05:14.047
My place.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.583
You passed out.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.551
I know I said I'd
carry you home,

05:17.618 --> 05:19.186
but dizzy Frank
isn't good

05:19.252 --> 05:20.454
about keeping his promises.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.924
Hey, that looks like
my house.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.060
You even have the six Frisbees
we lost on the roof.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.362
Yeah.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.863
I used satellite images

05:29.930 --> 05:32.065
and built a model
of the whole town.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.803
I'm not as weird
as you thought I was, am I?

05:40.941 --> 05:43.511
I can't believe you
made a tiny Natesville.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.013
Well, it's not
technically Natesville.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.615
It's New Natesville.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.818
It's exactly like Natesville,
except way cooler.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.319
Is that you?

05:52.386 --> 05:54.688
Yeah. I was just
having a beer.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.890
I was exhausted
after helping my parents

05:56.957 --> 05:58.459
move back into town.

05:58.526 --> 06:01.328
I thought your parents
moved to Florida.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.997
No, not in
New Natesville.

06:04.064 --> 06:08.035
They missed me so much,
they moved back.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.102
Here, check it out.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.676
This is them driving up
in their moving van.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.645
They sped, they were
so eager to see me.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.747
I did most of
the moving.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.749
Mom likes how
strong I am.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.451
And then we
celebrated

06:23.517 --> 06:25.252
with sparkling cider

06:25.318 --> 06:28.456
'cause in New Natesville,
my dad's not an alcoholic.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.690
It's really artistic.

06:29.757 --> 06:30.991
Thanks.
Yeah.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.594
I got the idea from this
really cool documentary

06:33.661 --> 06:35.629
called Marwencol.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.898
I base a lot
of my life on movies.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.600
My hair?

06:39.667 --> 06:41.802
Lou Diamond Phillips,
Young Guns II.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.304
Everything looks
so accurate.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.574
Everything except
Eagle Mountain.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.976
Originally, I used
cocoa powder,

06:49.042 --> 06:50.243
but I kept destroying it

06:50.310 --> 06:51.679
every time I craved
chocolate milk,

06:51.745 --> 06:53.481
and so, I gotta
switch to dirt.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.449
Whoa.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.417
Cool. Howdy's.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.952
(laughing excitedly)

07:02.422 --> 07:04.124
What's with
all the balloons?

07:04.191 --> 07:07.427
New Natesville has a bit
of an alien problem.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.832
Last week, he tried
to attack the store.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.334
He didn't count on
Frank the deli ninja.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.537
(chuckles)
Barney threw me a party

07:16.604 --> 07:18.706
and named me
employee of the year.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.541
At the
awards ceremony,

07:20.608 --> 07:23.511
I got to meet the
Dukes of Hazzard.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.479
The alien's into
Marilyn Manson?

07:25.546 --> 07:29.517
Well, he's sort of loosely based
on this kid I used to know.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.084
Back in junior high,

07:31.151 --> 07:34.054
I wasn't the cool,
confident Frank you know.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.123
Mostly 'cause of
Tommy Bitzleberger.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.525
Hey, Frank.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.093
Put your hair the
way I like it.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.631
Good.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.266
Now I'm going to do the
"Frank the Skank" rap.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.601
I need a beat.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.970
Bang your head against
the window for me, skank.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.173
(clears throat)

07:53.240 --> 07:55.075
Ow, ow...

07:55.142 --> 07:56.877
* Frank the Skank
smells really rank *

07:56.944 --> 07:58.612
* His father drank,
his sister stank *

07:58.679 --> 08:00.347
* His fat mama's
got a butt *

08:00.413 --> 08:01.915
* The size of a tank. *
(laughs)

08:01.982 --> 08:04.518
She can't exercise
because of fibromyalgia.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.820
Hey, stay on the beat!

08:08.255 --> 08:09.857
Ow, ow...

08:11.725 --> 08:13.226
I don't believe this.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.494
I know.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.963
You'd think a
Marilyn Manson fan

08:16.029 --> 08:17.565
would have
more class.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.199
No, I mean that it
was Bitzleberger.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.835
He bullied me, too.

08:22.803 --> 08:23.971
The shirt's fine.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.739
You look like a Backyard Boy.

08:25.806 --> 08:26.940
It's a girl's shirt.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.842
You have poor parents
and narrow shoulders.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.878
My hand-me-downs
are all that fit you.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.346
Burt, quit messing
with their grass.

08:33.413 --> 08:34.514
This is impressive fescue.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.949
Leave it alone.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.250
Relax.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.052
Nobody's going to know
it's a girl's shirt.

08:42.489 --> 08:46.894
...ow, ow, ow, ow,

08:46.960 --> 08:49.162
ow, ow,

08:49.229 --> 08:53.901
ow, ow, ow, ow...

08:53.967 --> 08:55.268
Hey.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.337
That's a girl's shirt.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.707
Um, no, it's not.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.041
It's...
It's a girl's shirt.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.810
The buttons are on
the other side.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.012
All that's missing
are some boobs.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.546
Make some boobs.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.181
I-I really don't want to...

09:08.248 --> 09:10.150
Make some boobs.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.756
(sighs)

09:16.757 --> 09:17.691
(laughing):
Check it out.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.092
This kid's got boobs.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.894
(laughs)
Stop it.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.163
Oh, is that what you want?
You want me to stop?

09:26.566 --> 09:27.935
Yes!

09:28.001 --> 09:29.603
Dad, can you make
Tommy Bitzleberger

09:29.670 --> 09:32.472
stop picking on me?
Can't fight your
battles for you, son.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.741
Come on, Burt.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.943
He tore what used to be
my favorite blouse.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.778
Jimmy, just hit him once.
Trust me.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.246
And he'll stop
beating me up?

09:39.312 --> 09:40.547
Oh, no, he'll
still beat you up.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.982
But he'll move on
to weaker prey.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.083
It's the law
of the jungle.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.251
(laughing)

09:44.317 --> 09:45.853
What are you laughing at?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.120
"Law of the jungle."

09:47.187 --> 09:48.756
I just keep seeing
a monkey judge

09:48.822 --> 09:50.190
with a banana gavel.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.224
(laughs)

09:51.291 --> 09:52.559
That's great.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.127
Why doesn't somebody
put that on TV?

09:54.194 --> 09:56.229
(Burt laughing)

09:56.296 --> 09:57.698
Whoo!

09:57.765 --> 09:59.733
(both laughing)

09:59.800 --> 10:02.002
I never stood up to him,
but luckily,

10:02.069 --> 10:05.338
he got sick of picking on me
and eventually left me alone.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.174
I was not so lucky.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.877
He tortured me
every day in high school.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.212
And once every six months
after high school.

10:13.513 --> 10:14.882
We used to have
the same dentist.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.786
Do you think we
can take some pictures

10:18.852 --> 10:21.922
of my doll beating up
Bitzleberger's doll?

10:21.989 --> 10:23.657
Dude, he's your doll.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.393
I think it's kind of weird
you're asking my permission.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.763
You don't want to show
that kind of weakness

10:29.830 --> 10:31.164
in front of the alien.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.371
(Burt grunting)

10:38.438 --> 10:39.673
Hey. Be careful.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.108
She had a big breakfast.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.209
I can tell.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.576
I'm kicking myself
for not doing this

10:43.643 --> 10:44.712
with Jimmy when he was a baby.

10:44.778 --> 10:45.979
The bigger she gets,

10:46.046 --> 10:48.015
the stronger I'll be.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.217
The bigger she gets,
the weirder it'll be.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.685
(knocking at door)

10:51.752 --> 10:53.353
(sighs)

10:53.420 --> 10:54.421
Hey.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.622
Guys, is Jimmy here?

10:55.689 --> 10:57.390
No. Nobody knows
where he is,

10:57.457 --> 10:59.727
'cause he's a very dangerous,
very edgy guy.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.528
Come on in, hon.
I'm actually kind of

11:01.594 --> 11:02.696
worried about him.
Yeah, me, too.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.197
He was supposed to come
over for breakfast.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.366
He was gonna tell me
about Frank's party.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.901
I'm very curious to know
if Frank's uncle

11:07.968 --> 11:08.936
is just Frank
wearing a mustache.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.237
You don't think this Frank guy

11:10.303 --> 11:12.072
could've done something crazy
to him, do you?

11:12.139 --> 11:13.874
I'm surprised every day
when Frank doesn't

11:13.941 --> 11:15.142
do something crazy to all of us.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.779
Look, if you guys
are worried about him,

11:18.846 --> 11:20.480
I'm happy to go get him.

11:20.547 --> 11:24.351
But he's a very tough,
sexy, very virile young guy.

11:24.417 --> 11:28.822
Oh, Jimmy, you were so brave
to fight that alien.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.058
Let me tenderly tend your wounds

11:31.124 --> 11:33.160
and occasionally
make out with you.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.467
Hey, Frank.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.037
You seen Jimmy?

11:44.104 --> 11:45.405
No.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.840
I haven't seen Jimmy.

11:46.907 --> 11:47.875
Jimmy who?

11:47.941 --> 11:49.777
Jimmy, my son.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.511
He went out with
you last night.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.847
Nope.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.215
What's with the tarp

11:55.282 --> 11:56.950
and the shallow grave
you're digging there?

11:57.017 --> 11:59.619
I may be putting in a pool.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.755
Or digging to China.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.090
What business is it of yours?

12:04.257 --> 12:05.793
I think you're the one
who's shallow.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.596
Cards on the table, Frank.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.931
Did you kill my boy?

12:13.366 --> 12:14.401
No!

12:14.467 --> 12:15.869
You can't go in there!

12:15.936 --> 12:17.838
What about your boyfriend?

12:17.905 --> 12:20.073
Oh, the aliens
turned him into foam

12:20.140 --> 12:22.309
and made a mattress out of him.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.644
Let's lie down on him
and start kissing.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.513
Whoa... oh...!

12:26.579 --> 12:27.948
Playing with dolls?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.918
I send you out
to become more of a man

12:30.984 --> 12:31.952
and you're playing with dolls?

12:32.019 --> 12:33.620
Please tell me
you're high on drugs.

12:33.686 --> 12:34.955
No.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.758
You can kill him now.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.999
JIMMY: And then Frank jumped
on the alien's back

12:46.066 --> 12:47.234
and totally saved
the whole store.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.468
Cool, right?

12:48.535 --> 12:52.205
Okay, Jimmy, playing dolls
with your daughter is sensitive,

12:52.272 --> 12:53.773
but playing dolls with Frank
is freakin' weird.

12:53.841 --> 12:54.908
Uh, yeah.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.543
Especially because
there's a doll

12:56.609 --> 12:59.980
that looks just like me that has
ridiculously huge boobs.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.849
Yeah, apparently Frank's doll
bought those for you.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.516
Not comforting.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.785
You guys just don't understand
what Frank and I do

13:05.853 --> 13:08.755
because you weren't picked on
by Tommy Bitzleberger.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.258
The bully from the bus
when you were 12?

13:11.324 --> 13:12.860
I knew it.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.195
I knew if you didn't stand up to
him, it would haunt you forever.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.563
He needed to make it stop
on his own.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.098
That's why I told you
not to get involved.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.599
Burt, not in front
of the boy.

13:19.666 --> 13:20.767
Get involved?

13:20.834 --> 13:22.669
I thought he was
just sick of me.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.572
Or maybe when I started bringing
that light saber to school,

13:25.638 --> 13:27.007
it sort of scared him off.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.009
Yeah, I bet it was
that light stick thing.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.377
You were very nimble
with that.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.345
Who wants pie?

13:32.412 --> 13:33.180
Virginia, just tell him.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.747
Kid's playing with dolls.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.916
What's there left to save?

13:35.983 --> 13:37.584
VIRGINIA:
Fine.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.554
After a few months,
it was clear

13:41.621 --> 13:43.924
that you weren't going to
take care of things yourself.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.393
Your father
wasn't any help.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.428
And I was running out
of blouses that fit you.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.266
So, I took care
of things myself.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.835
(grunts)

13:55.903 --> 13:58.505
GIRL: See you tomorrow!
GIRL: Okay!

13:58.571 --> 14:00.407
(Virginia grunting)

14:00.473 --> 14:02.275
Listen to me,
you little foot wart.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.644
You like to make fun of kids
who wear girls' shirts?

14:04.711 --> 14:07.580
For your information,
it's the newest thing.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.482
It's called "metero-sexual."

14:09.549 --> 14:12.385
But you wouldn't know that since
you don't read Parade magazine.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.988
Maybe you should
wear some lipstick,

14:15.055 --> 14:16.789
since you think boys
who look like girls

14:16.856 --> 14:18.025
are so hilarious.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.092
Huh?
(grunts)

14:20.627 --> 14:21.461
Go!

14:24.397 --> 14:26.366
And walk like
you're wearing high heels!

14:29.536 --> 14:30.904
(laughs)

14:30.971 --> 14:32.805
And he never
bothered you again.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.307
Why didn't you just tell me?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.808
I figured,
what's the harm?

14:35.875 --> 14:39.246
I really didn't see this creepy
playing with dolls thing coming.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.114
Well, there's only
one thing to do.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.682
You got to fight this guy.

14:42.749 --> 14:43.917
(scoffs)
What?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.185
That's crazy.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.954
No, your father's right.
You need to finally

14:47.020 --> 14:48.288
stand up for
yourself.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.990
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

14:50.057 --> 14:51.224
But he was huge.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.625
What-what if he
kept growing?

14:52.692 --> 14:53.994
I grew two feet
since then.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.295
He was already
six-foot-three.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.730
He'd be eight-foot-three.

14:57.797 --> 14:58.798
There's two of you now.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.167
You and Frank
can take this guy.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.902
Together, the two of you
are, like, 12-foot-16.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.837
Jimmy, you have to do this.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.639
You have to vanquish your beast.

15:06.706 --> 15:07.640
Like Beowulf.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.511
Moby Dick.

15:12.679 --> 15:13.947
Revenge of the Nerds?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.015
Oh.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.016
BURT: It'll be dangerous,

15:16.083 --> 15:17.884
but you can be dangerous, son.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.652
Right?

15:22.222 --> 15:24.091
Yeah, I can be dangerous.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.726
Okay, all right, yeah.

15:26.793 --> 15:27.727
I'll do it.

15:27.794 --> 15:28.828
This is awesome.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.130
And don't forget,

15:30.197 --> 15:31.664
you got Frank the deli ninja.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.301
I mean, you've seen how good
he is with sausage nunchucks.

15:39.106 --> 15:39.973
You're ready.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.308
Let's do this.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.554
("Thunderstruck"
by AC/DC playing)

15:56.756 --> 15:58.158
(engine starts)

16:18.078 --> 16:19.246
* Thunder *

16:21.148 --> 16:23.250
* Thunder *

16:25.218 --> 16:27.120
* Thunder *

16:27.187 --> 16:28.821
(tires screech)

16:28.888 --> 16:30.490
* Thunder *

16:32.625 --> 16:35.028
* Thunder *

16:35.095 --> 16:41.101
* I was caught in the middle
of a railroad track *

16:41.168 --> 16:42.702
* Thunder *

16:42.769 --> 16:48.375
* I looked round, and I knew
there was no turning back *

16:48.441 --> 16:50.510
* Tore me apart *

16:54.314 --> 16:56.549
* You've been thunderstruck *

16:56.616 --> 16:57.750
(spits)

17:02.889 --> 17:07.127
* Rode down the highway,
broke the limit *

17:07.194 --> 17:10.130
* We hit the town *

17:10.197 --> 17:13.233
* Went through to Texas,
yeah, Texas *

17:13.300 --> 17:17.237
* And we had some fun *

17:17.304 --> 17:19.772
* We met some girls *

17:19.839 --> 17:24.577
* Some dancers
who gave a good time *

17:24.644 --> 17:28.181
* Broke all the rules,
played all the fools *

17:28.248 --> 17:30.917
* Yeah, yeah, they, they *

17:30.983 --> 17:33.786
* They blew our minds *

17:33.853 --> 17:37.924
* And I was shaking
at the knees *

17:37.990 --> 17:41.194
* Could I come again please *

17:41.261 --> 17:44.864
* Yeah, the ladies
were too kind *

17:44.931 --> 17:46.065
* You've been... *

17:46.133 --> 17:47.434
Uh, oh.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.969
Uh, we're looking for
Tommy Bitzleberger.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.971
Is-Is he home?

17:52.038 --> 17:54.141
Well, yes, sort of.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.742
I'm Tommy Bitzleberger.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.179
Although it's
Tammy Bitzleberger now.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.555
And after a lot
of reflection, I realized

18:08.621 --> 18:10.557
the reason I was
beating you guys up was because

18:10.623 --> 18:13.760
something was missing
from my life: a vagina.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.428
Now I sort of have one.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.830
I tried to be the tough guy,

18:17.897 --> 18:19.432
but inside was
a pretty little girl

18:19.499 --> 18:20.633
afraid to come out.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.774
I was never happy as Tommy.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.909
I guess that's why
I was so angry all the time.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.944
I'm really sorry, guys.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.313
That's okay.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.514
Here we've been blaming you
for what happened,

18:34.581 --> 18:36.349
but I guess those years
were hard on all of us.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.186
(chuckles)
I think we got
what we came for.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.453
Uh, thanks for
the lemon...

18:40.520 --> 18:42.088
* Thunderstruck *
What-what are you doing?!

18:42.155 --> 18:43.290
Your dad was right.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.691
That felt awesome.

18:44.757 --> 18:45.525
I never felt so...

18:45.592 --> 18:47.460
(grunts)

18:47.527 --> 18:49.229
You think you can
come onto my porch

18:49.296 --> 18:50.497
and drink my lemonade?!

18:50.563 --> 18:51.998
I didn't drink any... ow!

18:52.064 --> 18:53.800
lemonade!

18:53.866 --> 18:55.067
Jimmy, help!

18:55.134 --> 18:56.469
Leave him alone!

18:56.536 --> 18:57.970
Stop it!

18:58.037 --> 18:59.639
You want me
to stop? Huh?

18:59.706 --> 19:01.908
Is that what
you want? Huh?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.243
You want me to stop?

19:03.310 --> 19:04.177
Is that what
you want? Huh?

19:04.244 --> 19:05.378
Stop it!

19:06.546 --> 19:08.348
* Thunderstruck *

19:09.549 --> 19:12.652
* Thunderstruck *

19:12.719 --> 19:16.423
* Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thunderstruck *
(grunting)

19:17.390 --> 19:18.525
Aerial assault!

19:18.591 --> 19:20.493
(yelling)
(yelling)

19:24.531 --> 19:26.165
* Thunderstruck... *

19:28.301 --> 19:30.169
Hey...
(screams)

19:30.237 --> 19:32.805
* You've been thunderstruck! *

19:32.872 --> 19:35.007
Uncle! Uncle!

19:35.074 --> 19:36.509
Say aunt! Say aunt!

19:36.576 --> 19:39.346
Aunt! Aunt!
Aunt! Aunt!

19:43.283 --> 19:44.784
VIRGINIA: I knew
I should've gone with you.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.787
I never would've let
that fella hurt my baby.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.222
He was unstoppable, Mom.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.791
He was a large, large
unstoppable man.

19:51.858 --> 19:52.959
Very manly.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.262
Penis and everything.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.864
He used it as a weapon.

19:57.930 --> 19:58.898
I don't remember that part.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.367
In fact, I don't
think that happened.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.368
Pretty sure of it.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.603
But he was a big man.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.171
You're gonna need ice on this.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.606
Why didn't you guys just run

20:06.673 --> 20:08.508
as soon as he opened the door?

20:08.575 --> 20:12.245
I mean, six-ten, 290 pounds
and he had a dart gun?

20:12.312 --> 20:13.980
He shot me full of

20:14.046 --> 20:15.682
tranquilizer darts.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.117
That explains any
inconsistencies in my story.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.286
SABRINA: Hmm.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.688
Congratulations, Jimmy.

20:21.754 --> 20:22.755
You did it.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.624
You start doing
the Hope workout with me,

20:24.691 --> 20:26.125
you'll be able
to kick anybody's ass.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.860
Although she's heavy.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.962
There's a preemie
at day care you might
want to start off with.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.899
Thanks, Dad, but I didn't
get revenge on my bully.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.268
Sabrina's got to
think I'm an idiot.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.803
It doesn't matter
if you got your ass kicked.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.138
You fought. You got
the monkey off your back.

20:39.205 --> 20:41.140
And I wouldn't worry
about Sabrina.

20:41.207 --> 20:43.876
Everybody knows
girls love black eyes.

20:43.943 --> 20:44.811
True.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.379
But how does that
help us, Dad?

20:46.446 --> 20:47.347
We're white guys.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.915
No, I said black eyes.

20:48.981 --> 20:49.882
Ah.
Oh.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.518
Well, I've got
one of those.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.987
Looks pretty cool, actually.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.227
Can you close the other eye
and give me a little Rocky?

21:01.294 --> 21:04.464
Adrian!

21:05.498 --> 21:07.334
(both laughing)

21:07.400 --> 21:08.935
JIMMY:
Dad was right.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.169
It was a great day.

21:10.236 --> 21:13.139
I impressed my girl
just like I imagined.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.508
I stood up to my bully.

21:15.575 --> 21:19.211
And the most surprising thing:
I made a new friend.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.780
Even though we didn't
need to play out

21:20.847 --> 21:23.282
our revenge fantasy anymore,

21:23.350 --> 21:25.318
that didn't mean we couldn't
hang out now and then

21:25.385 --> 21:27.354
and have some fun.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.993
CHILD:
Do something nice today.
