11:28.943 --> 11:32.226
BUT I DON'T WANT TO.

11:32.327 --> 11:33.496
COME ON. JUST TRY IT.

11:34.456 --> 11:36.112
IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

11:36.212 --> 11:37.531
I PROMISE.

11:37.631 --> 11:38.802
[SIGHS]

11:39.220 --> 11:41.350
AAH...AAH.

11:42.476 --> 11:43.982
OK, NOW YOU
JUST ROCK IT GENTLY.

11:45.484 --> 11:48.018
PHOEBE, I KNOW
HOW TO HOLD A BABY.

11:48.118 --> 11:50.397
THAT IS NOT
THE ISSUE, THANK YOU.

11:50.497 --> 11:52.337
JUST GIVE IT A SHOT.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.551
WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT TO LOSE?

11:55.303 --> 11:56.347
ANOTHER WITCH
HAS BEEN KILLED.

11:58.937 --> 12:00.257
OH, NO.

12:00.358 --> 12:01.426
YEAH, THE POLICE

12:01.527 --> 12:02.734
FOUND HER BODY
BEHIND THE CANNON THEATER.

12:02.744 --> 12:04.433
WELL,
WE SHOULD GO THERE

12:04.534 --> 12:05.436
AND SEE WHAT
WE CAN FIND OUT.

12:05.536 --> 12:06.900
WE GOT TO CALL MORRIS
ON THE WAY,

12:07.000 --> 12:08.528
Phoebe: MAKE SURE
HE CAN GET US IN.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.033
AND, NO,
YOU CANNOT COME.

12:10.133 --> 12:11.495
SOMEONE
MIGHT RECOGNIZE YOU

12:11.595 --> 12:12.915
FROM WHEN
YOU POSED AS A D.A.

12:13.016 --> 12:14.795
WHAT, I DON'T GET
TO GO ANYWHERE ANYMORE?

12:14.896 --> 12:16.968
YOU WERE A DEMON
AND A LAWYER?

12:17.068 --> 12:19.492
INSERT JOKE HERE.

12:20.494 --> 12:21.662
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

12:22.582 --> 12:24.570
IT'S PAIGE'S.

12:24.670 --> 12:26.075
NO. IT'S YOURS.

12:26.175 --> 12:27.493
YOU NEED
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

12:27.594 --> 12:29.057
YEAH, DADDY,

12:30.394 --> 12:31.604

12:32.608 --> 12:33.986
EXCUSE ME.

12:34.404 --> 12:35.908
UM...

12:39.084 --> 12:42.300
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

12:45.934 --> 12:50.054
Morris:
LOOK, I CAN'T GUARANTEE
YOU MUCH TIME ON THIS.

12:50.154 --> 12:52.519
JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL STAY ON THE FRINGE.

12:52.619 --> 12:54.065
Phoebe: WE PROMISE.

12:54.165 --> 12:55.459
SO WHAT DO WE KNOW?

12:56.921 --> 12:58.534
MAN CALLED 911
FROM THAT PAY PHONE,

12:58.635 --> 13:00.498
REPORTED
HE HAD FOUND A BODY.

13:00.599 --> 13:02.186
Piper:
LOOKS LIKE SHE WASN'T
THE ONLY VICTIM.

13:03.688 --> 13:05.593
SCORCH MARK.

13:05.693 --> 13:06.764
DEFINITELY DEMONIC.

13:06.864 --> 13:08.769
LOOKS LIKE ONE
OF COLE'S, ACTUALLY.

13:08.869 --> 13:11.608
DON'T YOU MEAN
BELTHAZOR?

13:11.709 --> 13:13.298
IT'S TOO BAD
COLE CAN'T CHECK IT OUT.

13:14.716 --> 13:17.416
PROBABLY BE ABLE
TO TELL US WHO DID IT.

13:17.517 --> 13:20.632
IS ANYONE FROM
THE D.A.'s OFFICE HERE?

13:20.732 --> 13:22.637
YEAH, THAT GUY
OVER THERE'S AN A.D.A.

13:22.737 --> 13:24.268
HE'S INTERVIEWING
ONE OF THE VICTIM'S FRIENDS.

13:24.369 --> 13:26.164
THEY ALSO FOUND THIS
ON THE VICTIM.

13:26.748 --> 13:29.047
TRIPLE-CRESCENT.

13:30.175 --> 13:31.328
DOES THIS
MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU?

13:31.428 --> 13:33.250
I STUDIED IT IN
ONE OF PIPER'S QUIZZES.

13:33.350 --> 13:34.668
IT'S AN
ANCIENT WICCAN SYMBOL,

13:34.769 --> 13:36.174
A COUSIN
TO THE TRIQUETRA.

13:36.275 --> 13:37.676
COULD BE
THE MARK OF A COVEN.

13:37.777 --> 13:39.433
A COVEN SOMEONE'S
TRYING TO WIPE OUT.

13:39.533 --> 13:40.936
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHO ELSE IS IN IT.

13:41.036 --> 13:42.732
MAYBE
THE VICTIM'S FRIEND.

13:42.833 --> 13:45.507
ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.247
PHOEBE.

13:48.347 --> 13:49.626
FRINGE, OK?

13:49.727 --> 13:50.629
FRINGE.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.316
A.D.A.: AND SHE
HADN'T COMPLAINED ABOUT
ANY DISGRUNTLED FRIENDS,

13:53.818 --> 13:56.726
CO-WORKERS,
EX-BOYFRIENDS?

13:56.826 --> 13:58.983
NO.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.362
KARI WAS
A BEAUTIFUL PERSON.

14:00.463 --> 14:02.926
EVERYONE LOVED HER.

14:04.556 --> 14:05.850
IF YOU CAN THINK OF ANYTHING
ELSE AT ALL, PLEASE,

14:08.567 --> 14:11.073
DON'T HESITATE TO CALL.

14:18.092 --> 14:21.626
I LIKE YOUR NECKLACE.

14:21.726 --> 14:22.837
DO I KNOW YOU?

14:22.937 --> 14:25.026
NO. BUT YOU
MIGHT KNOW <i>OF</i> ME
AND MY SISTERS.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.413
[WHISPERING]
The Charmed Ones.

14:31.918 --> 14:33.715
YOU AND KARI WERE
IN THE SAME COVEN?

14:34.844 --> 14:36.498
YES.

14:36.598 --> 14:38.018
AND YOUR MARK IS
THE TRIPLE CRESCENT.

14:44.410 --> 14:48.044
WHAT IS IT?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:49.674 --> 14:52.872
Piper: WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'D YOU SEE?

14:52.972 --> 14:54.962
THE DEMON.
HE'S AFTER HER.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.612
WHERE?

14:58.614 --> 14:59.558
UH, BY THE STEPS
IN SOME PARK.

14:59.658 --> 15:02.898
I THINK IT WAS LIKE
AN OLD AMPHITHEATER
OR SOMETHING.

15:02.999 --> 15:05.155
I KNOW THAT. THAT'S
IN STANLEY ARBORETUM.

15:05.255 --> 15:07.035
I WALK PAST IT EVERY DAY
ON THE WAY TO WORK.

15:07.135 --> 15:08.914
WHAT'D THE DEMON
LOOK LIKE?

15:09.014 --> 15:10.729
LIKE BELTHAZOR.

15:11.564 --> 15:13.151
I MEAN, NOT
EXACTLY LIKE HIM.
JUST SIMILAR.

15:13.820 --> 15:17.354
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOIN' ON HERE?

15:17.454 --> 15:19.359
THIS IS A MURDER
INVESTIGATION.

15:19.459 --> 15:21.114
WHO ARE
THESE PEOPLE?

15:21.214 --> 15:22.409
I'LL GET RID OF 'EM.

15:22.509 --> 15:23.953
COME ON, LADIES.
MOVE ALONG.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.958
FIRST TIME,
I ASK NICELY.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.104
WE'RE GOING, MISTER.

15:36.797 --> 15:41.041
Susan: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IF YOU KNOW THE DEMON
IS MEANT TO ATTACK HERE,

15:41.141 --> 15:44.049
SHOULDN'T WE GO
SOMEPLACE ELSE?

15:44.149 --> 15:45.637
Piper: NOT IF WE
WANNA GET RID OF HIM
FOR GOOD.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.600
Paige:
POWER OF THREE SPELL?

15:47.700 --> 15:49.020
NO. THE ONLY WAY
TO VANQUISH
AN UPPER-LEVEL DEMON

15:49.120 --> 15:51.693
IS WITH A POTION
OF HIS OWN FLESH.

15:51.794 --> 15:53.658
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

15:53.758 --> 15:55.161
ONCE.
ON MY FIANCÃ©.

15:55.261 --> 15:58.002
Paige: YOUR FIANCÃ©?

15:58.102 --> 15:59.422
YEAH. I JUST
WANTED TO HEAR
HOW IT SOUNDED.

15:59.522 --> 16:01.511
AND?

16:01.611 --> 16:02.514
KINDA WEIRD.
YEAH

16:02.614 --> 16:03.809
WAIT. WAIT. BACK UP.
DID YOU SAY

16:03.909 --> 16:05.271
YOU ONCE TRIED
TO VANQUISH COLE?

16:05.371 --> 16:06.649
NO. BELTHAZOR.
THERE'S
A DIFFERENCE.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.655
IS THERE?

16:08.755 --> 16:09.866
OK, LET'S REVIEW.

16:09.966 --> 16:11.171
I PLAY DECOY.

16:11.181 --> 16:14.168
YOU SLICE AND DICE
UNTIL WE GET
THE DEMON SUSHI,

16:14.268 --> 16:16.676
AND THEN WE
GET OUT OF THERE.

16:16.776 --> 16:17.761
EVERYBODY READY?

16:17.862 --> 16:18.931
AS READY
AS I'LL EVER BE.

16:19.032 --> 16:21.202
I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR COAT AND YOUR HAT.

16:24.880 --> 16:28.221
UM, AND YOUR NECKLACE.

16:32.066 --> 16:35.993
OK, WE GOTTA GET SUSAN
SOME PLACE SAFE. LEO?!

16:36.242 --> 16:39.001
HI, HONEY. COULD YOU
ORB SUSAN OUT OF HERE?

16:40.252 --> 16:42.325
SURE. ANY PLACE IN MIND?

16:42.426 --> 16:43.788
HMM. I DON'T THINK
HOME IS A GOOD IDEA.

16:43.888 --> 16:46.879
ACTUALLY YOU SHOULD
TAKE HER TO MY OLD LOFT.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.383
I DON'T THINK
IT'S RENTED YET.

16:48.483 --> 16:49.511

16:55.000 --> 16:57.296

AND YOU DROP ROBOKID
OFF AT THE MANOR,

PLEASE? THANK YOU.

17:01.226 --> 17:03.147
OK, WE GOTTA
DO THIS FAST,

17:04.275 --> 17:05.846
'CAUSE THIS DEMON
WON'T STAY FROZEN
FOR LONG. READY?

17:05.945 --> 17:08.536
LET'S GO.

17:24.117 --> 17:27.275
HELLO, WITCH.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.822
GOOD-BYE...

17:28.922 --> 17:30.426

17:36.275 --> 17:39.406
AAH!

17:42.625 --> 17:45.908
I HAD HIM.

17:46.008 --> 17:47.427
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

17:55.283 --> 17:58.817
HE USED THIS
TO KILL MY FIANCÃ©.

17:58.917 --> 18:00.237
IT'S A CEREMONIAL KNIFE.

18:00.338 --> 18:01.867
THE DEMON LEFT IT BEHIND
AFTER THE STRUGGLE.

18:01.967 --> 18:03.830
I'VE BEEN HUNTING HIM DOWN
FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF.

18:03.930 --> 18:06.211
IT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

18:06.311 --> 18:08.108
MAY I?

18:09.820 --> 18:13.187
LOOK FAMILIAR?

18:13.287 --> 18:14.397
HE LOOKED
FAMILIAR TO ME.

18:14.498 --> 18:16.487
I MEANT THE ATHAME.

18:16.587 --> 18:17.574
IT'S ONE USED
BY THE BROTHERHOOD.

18:17.674 --> 18:19.287
EMMA, DO YOU KNOW WHY
THE DEMON WANTED TO KILL
YOUR FIANCÃ©?

18:19.387 --> 18:22.795
BECAUSE ANDREW WAS A WITCH.

18:22.895 --> 18:24.091
ARE YOU A WITCH, TOO?

18:24.191 --> 18:25.845
NO, BUT AFTER ANDREW DIED,
I STUDIED HIS BOOKS

18:25.945 --> 18:28.602
AND DEVOTED MYSELF
TO THE CRAFT.

18:28.703 --> 18:30.023
TO CONTINUE
HIS WORK?

18:30.123 --> 18:31.861
TO TRACK DOWN HIS KILLER.

18:31.961 --> 18:33.073
AND YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO BE IN THE PARK

18:33.173 --> 18:35.078
AT THE SAME TIME THE DEMON
WAS GOING TO ATTACK SUSAN?

18:35.178 --> 18:37.457
I KNOW HIS M.O. I KNOW
WHEN HE KILLS A WITCH,

18:37.558 --> 18:39.756
HE GOES AFTER
THE ENTIRE COVEN.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.597
YOU'VE TAUGHT
YOURSELF WELL.

18:42.697 --> 18:44.476
BUT STILL, IF WE
HADN'T COME ALONG,

18:44.576 --> 18:45.982
WE WOULD'VE
LOST YOU BOTH.

18:46.082 --> 18:47.485
VENGEANCE EMPOWERS ME.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.073
BUT IT WON'T SAVE YOU.

18:49.173 --> 18:50.928
YOUR DESIRE FOR REVENGE

18:51.846 --> 18:53.208
IS KEEPING YOU
FROM THE TRUTH.

18:53.309 --> 18:55.606
YOU WANT
THE DEMON VANQUISHED,

18:56.608 --> 18:57.594
MY ADVICE IS TO STAND BACK

18:57.694 --> 18:58.764
AND LET THE CHARMED ONES
HANDLE IT.

18:58.864 --> 19:00.352
THIS IS MY FIGHT.

19:00.452 --> 19:01.620
THEN YOU SHALL LOSE IT.

19:02.624 --> 19:04.421
COLE'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO TRUST US,

19:05.632 --> 19:08.415
TRUST THAT WE WANT
THE SAME THING YOU DO.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.544
IT'S JUST...

19:10.644 --> 19:12.901
HIS FACE HAS HAUNTED ME
EVER SINCE ANDREW DIED.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.749
IT'S THE FACE OF PURE EVIL.

19:20.254 --> 19:22.176
I CAN'T LET HIM GET AWAY.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.583
WHY DON'T YOU
SCRY FOR HIM AGAIN

19:25.683 --> 19:27.465
WHILE WE PREPARE
THE VANQUISHING POTION?

19:27.565 --> 19:29.677
ONCE WE GET A PIECE
OF HIS FLESH, HE'S DUST.

19:29.778 --> 19:32.185
WE'LL GET HIM.

19:32.285 --> 19:33.688
I SWEAR,
WE'LL GET HIM.

19:33.788 --> 19:35.569

19:35.669 --> 19:37.657
IGNORE THAT.

NOT SURE YET.

HE'S BASED DOWNTOWN.

19:54.759 --> 19:56.664
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH HIS CAPTAIN,

19:56.764 --> 19:58.516
AND YOU TELL HIM
MY OFFICE WANTS TO SEE
ALL OF HIS RECENT CASE FILES.

19:58.526 --> 20:01.093

20:01.194 --> 20:02.472
IN FACT, BETTER GO MAKE
THAT REQUEST IN PERSON.

20:02.572 --> 20:04.685
THIS WAY THEY CAN'T
DUCK YOU ON THE PHONE.

20:04.785 --> 20:06.733
I'LL BE BACK
AS SOON AS I CAN.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.588
THAT'S OK.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

20:15.774 --> 20:19.308
I'M GONNA LURE

YOU UNDERSTAND?

20:25.840 --> 20:28.707
FORTUNATELY, THEY WON'T
RECOGNIZE ME IN MY HUMAN FORM.

20:28.808 --> 20:31.632

HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.

20:31.732 --> 20:35.282

IS PERFECT COVER.

LEAVE ME.

I'LL HAVE TO STAY HERE?

20:50.322 --> 20:52.810
WELL, I'LL TALK
TO YOUR WHITELIGHTER,

20:52.910 --> 20:54.327
BUT MY INSTINCTS
TELL ME THAT EVERYONE
IN YOUR COVEN

20:54.337 --> 20:56.362

THEIR ROUTINE UNTIL
THIS THREAT IS OVER.

CAN YOU COME
OVER TO THE OFFICE NOW?

21:18.395 --> 21:19.881

21:19.981 --> 21:21.428

I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

HOW HE VANISHED?

21:32.055 --> 21:33.166

21:33.266 --> 21:34.920

21:35.020 --> 21:37.554
LIKE, UH, BELTHAZOR.

21:37.654 --> 21:39.934
I--I THINK I FOUND HIM.

21:40.034 --> 21:41.647
WHERE?

21:41.748 --> 21:42.692
HE'S AT, UH,
PRESCOTT AND...

21:42.792 --> 21:45.365
PINE.

21:45.465 --> 21:46.635
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

21:47.513 --> 21:48.415
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.043
WAIT, HE'S HERE
IN THE HOUSE?

21:50.143 --> 21:52.383
I'LL GO
CHECK UPSTAIRS.

21:52.484 --> 21:54.070
YOU FIND
YOUR SISTERS.
GET READY.

22:01.424 --> 22:04.624
HELLO?

22:04.724 --> 22:05.978
AH, MISS COLEMAN.

22:06.896 --> 22:08.843
WHO'S THIS?

22:08.943 --> 22:10.111
I'M A FRIEND.

22:11.114 --> 22:12.494
IS IT A PROBLEM?

22:14.248 --> 22:15.694
NO. NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

22:15.794 --> 22:17.909
UM, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST WAIT OVER THERE?

22:18.009 --> 22:20.138
AND, UH, I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN IT'S OVER.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.988
RIGHT THIS WAY.

22:43.826 --> 22:47.068
PHOEBE?

22:47.168 --> 22:48.211
HE'S NOT UPSTAIRS.

22:50.719 --> 22:51.622
NOT DOWNSTAIRS, EITHER.

22:51.722 --> 22:53.308
IT'S THE A.D.A.

22:54.562 --> 22:55.465
SYKES?
HE TRIED TO KILL HER.

22:55.565 --> 22:57.134
I DON'T KNOW IF HE
FOLLOWED US HERE OR NOT.

22:57.234 --> 22:58.974
WATCH OUT!

22:59.074 --> 23:00.411
TAKE HER UPSTAIRS.

23:02.499 --> 23:03.836
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.

23:11.565 --> 23:15.116
HURRY! SLICE HIM.

23:16.285 --> 23:19.903
OH, PAIGE.
JUST DO IT.

23:20.004 --> 23:21.381
THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE SQUEAMISH.

23:22.384 --> 23:23.137
AAH!

23:25.643 --> 23:28.776
GOT IT.

23:39.136 --> 23:42.252
OH, MY GOD.

23:42.352 --> 23:43.606
BELTHAZOR, WE MEET AT LAST.

23:44.693 --> 23:47.575
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

23:50.416 --> 23:54.092
WE'LL FINISH THIS LATER.

23:55.178 --> 23:56.765
IS EVERYBODY OK?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.634
I'M OK.

24:00.735 --> 24:02.364
EMMA?

24:03.283 --> 24:04.703
HE'S NOT THE DEMON
WHO KILLED MY FIANCÃ©.

24:05.412 --> 24:07.417
HE IS.

24:15.941 --> 24:19.308
HE'S A KILLER!

24:19.408 --> 24:20.351
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU PEOPLE?!

24:20.451 --> 24:21.480
EMMA, I KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET,

24:21.580 --> 24:22.567
BUT YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

24:22.667 --> 24:24.238
LET GO OF ME!

24:24.338 --> 24:25.364
YOU'RE MAKING
A HUGE MISTAKE.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.120
HE IS NOT
WHO YOU THINK HE IS.

24:27.221 --> 24:28.540
HE'S THE DEMON
WHO KILLED MY FIANCÃ©,

24:28.640 --> 24:30.477
AND THAT IS
ALL I NEED TO KNOW.

24:32.567 --> 24:36.393
HOW CAN YOU
PROTECT A MURDERER?

24:36.493 --> 24:39.127
HOW CAN YOU
LIVE WITH YOURSELF?

24:45.516 --> 24:48.676
IS SHE RIGHT?

24:48.776 --> 24:51.058
ARE YOU THE ONE
WHO KILLED HIM?

24:51.158 --> 24:53.497
Phoebe: HONEY,
NOW'S NOT THE TIME.
WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SYKES.

24:55.543 --> 24:58.550
WE GOT WHAT WE NEED.
YOU GUYS WORK ON
THE VANQUISHING POTION.

25:09.038 --> 25:12.547
WE NEED TO TALK.

25:25.621 --> 25:29.450
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE SCARED OF ME.

25:29.550 --> 25:31.388
NO, DON'T
BE RIDICULOUS.

25:32.432 --> 25:34.963
THAT'S GOOD.

25:35.064 --> 25:37.303
BECAUSE I THINK
EMMA'S RIGHT.

25:37.404 --> 25:39.241
I AM THE ONE WHO
KILLED HER FIANCÃ©.
THIS IS MINE.

25:47.430 --> 25:50.963
I DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER DOING IT.

25:51.063 --> 25:52.691
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.

25:54.364 --> 25:55.951
DIDN'T MATTER
WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.319
IT ONLY MATTERED THAT
I DID WHAT I WAS TOLD.

25:59.419 --> 26:00.964
HE WAS A WITCH.

26:02.051 --> 26:03.079
THE SOURCE VIEWED HIM
AS A THREAT.

26:03.179 --> 26:04.666
SHH.

26:04.766 --> 26:07.231
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO ME.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.431
YES, I DO.

26:10.531 --> 26:11.809
NO, YOU DON'T.
I KNOW WHO YOU WERE,

26:11.910 --> 26:14.775
WHO YOU USED TO BE.

26:14.875 --> 26:16.614
AND THAT'S NOT
THE PERSON YOU ARE ANYMORE.

26:16.714 --> 26:18.659
AREN'T I?

26:18.759 --> 26:20.306
BELTHAZOR STILL EXISTS
INSIDE OF ME.

26:21.978 --> 26:24.108
THAT HASN'T CHANGED,
NOR DOES IT CHANGE
WHAT I HAVE DONE.

26:24.775 --> 26:27.450
BUT JUST THINK OF ALL THE GOOD
YOU'VE DONE SINCE THEN.

26:36.223 --> 26:39.714
IT DOESN'T BALANCE OUT.

26:39.814 --> 26:42.306
IT DOESN'T
EVEN COME CLOSE.

26:42.406 --> 26:43.825
AND NOW THE VERY THING
I'VE BEEN TRYING SO HARD
NOT TO BE

26:46.082 --> 26:48.697
IS THE VERY THING
I MIGHT HAVE TO BECOME.

26:48.798 --> 26:51.722
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:54.102 --> 26:57.929
SYKES HAS DONE
A GOOD JOB
OF EMULATING ME,

26:58.030 --> 27:00.060
EMULATING BELTHAZOR,

27:00.160 --> 27:01.856
WHICH MEANS
IF THE POTION
DOESN'T WORK,

27:01.956 --> 27:04.196
THE ONLY WAY
TO DESTROY HIM

27:04.296 --> 27:05.950
IS FOR ME
TO TURN INTO BELTHAZOR.

27:06.051 --> 27:07.764
YEAH, BUT THEN AFTERWARDS
YOU'LL TURN BACK INTO COLE.

27:08.098 --> 27:11.632
I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO.

27:11.732 --> 27:13.903
TO STOP HIM I'LL HAVE TO
EMBRACE MY DEMONIC SELF
COMPLETELY.

27:15.868 --> 27:19.778
THERE MAY BE NO
COMING BACK FROM THAT.

27:19.879 --> 27:22.218
WELL, THEN, WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO MAKE SURE THAT POTION
WORKS VERY WELL.

27:24.390 --> 27:27.674
WON'T WE?

27:27.774 --> 27:29.429
I'LL BE BACK.

27:29.529 --> 27:30.847
WHERE YOU GOING?

27:30.947 --> 27:31.893
TO FIND EMMA.
TRY TO EXPLAIN.

27:31.993 --> 27:34.484
IT WON'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

27:34.584 --> 27:35.957
WELL, IT WILL IF I CAN
KEEP HER OUT OF THE CRAZINESS,

27:35.967 --> 27:39.037
KEEP HER FROM GETTING HURT.

27:39.137 --> 27:40.873
I'M MORE CONCERNED
WITH KEEPING YOU
OUT OF THE CRAZINESS,

27:40.974 --> 27:44.760
KEEPING YOU
FROM GETTING HURT.

27:44.861 --> 27:45.987
YOU STILL HAVE
SOME OF THAT

27:47.911 --> 27:48.990
BELTHAZOR VANQUISHING
POTION LEFT, DON'T YOU?

27:49.001 --> 27:51.319
YES, BUT--

27:51.419 --> 27:54.008
GET IT, JUST IN CASE.

27:55.304 --> 27:56.557
IT MIGHT BE
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP ME.

28:21.581 --> 28:25.157
OK, WE JUST NEED
THE PIG'S FEET.

28:25.257 --> 28:26.994
THEY'RE OVER THERE
BY THE MANDRAKE ROOT.

28:27.094 --> 28:28.875
POOR PIGGY PIGGY.

28:28.976 --> 28:31.172
THEY'RE SENSITIVE
CREATURES, YOU KNOW.

28:31.273 --> 28:33.345
SMART, TOO.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.141
YEAH, NOT THAT ONE.

28:35.241 --> 28:37.020
EW.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.002
OK, SO ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS DROP IN THE SYKES FLESH.

28:41.257 --> 28:43.095
GO AHEAD,
JUST DROP IT IN.

28:45.060 --> 28:46.143
AAAH!

28:48.233 --> 28:49.403
YOU DID THAT
ON PURPOSE, DIDN'T YOU?

28:52.159 --> 28:54.148
YEAH.

28:54.249 --> 28:55.419
YEAH, IT HAPPENED
TO ME LAST YEAR.

28:56.505 --> 28:59.037
NO SUBSTITUTE
FOR EXPERIENCE.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.586
YOU GIRLS ALL RIGHT?

29:01.686 --> 29:03.339
YEAH, WE WERE JUST DOING
A LITTLE SISTERLY BONDING,
THAT'S ALL.

29:03.439 --> 29:05.721
WHERE'S PHOEBE?

29:05.822 --> 29:07.058
THE POTION'LL BE READY
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

29:07.158 --> 29:09.397
SHE WENT
TO TALK TO EMMA,
EXPLAIN THINGS.

29:09.497 --> 29:12.111
GOOD LUCK.

29:12.211 --> 29:14.035
LOOK, I DON'T NEED
THE GUILT FROM YOU, OK?

29:14.135 --> 29:16.583
I'VE GOT ENOUGH
OF MY OWN TO DEAL WITH.

29:16.683 --> 29:18.128
WHAT, AND YOU THINK
THAT COVERS IT?
WHAT YOU DID?

29:18.228 --> 29:20.551
PAIGE, DON'T.

29:20.651 --> 29:22.137
DON'T WHAT, PIPER?
HE KILLED A MAN.
ARE YOU CONDONING THAT?

29:22.237 --> 29:24.937
NO, OF COURSE NOT, BUT
IT'S JUST NOT THAT SIMPLE.

29:25.038 --> 29:27.193
HE CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST,
AND YOU'VE SEEN HOW MUCH GOOD
HE'S HELPED US DO.

29:27.294 --> 29:30.787
THAT'S WHO HE IS NOW,
AND WE ACCEPT THAT.

29:30.887 --> 29:33.518
IF YOU SAY SO.

29:37.528 --> 29:40.813
THANK YOU.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.233
YOU WANT ME
TO HELP YOU
FIND SYKES?

29:42.333 --> 29:44.363
CAN YOU?

29:44.463 --> 29:45.742
IF HE'S
STILL EMULATING ME,
ALL I HAVE TO DO

29:45.842 --> 29:47.203
IS FIGURE OUT
WHAT I'D DO NEXT.

29:47.303 --> 29:48.205
WHICH WOULD BE?

29:48.305 --> 29:49.627
GO AFTER
THE CHARMED ONES.

29:49.727 --> 29:51.799
OH, THAT'S NICE.

29:51.900 --> 29:53.095
FIRST I'D HAVE TO
REGROUP SOMEWHERE,

29:53.195 --> 29:54.891
TEND TO MY CUT.

29:54.991 --> 29:56.103
THE MAUSOLEUM?

29:56.203 --> 29:57.229
EXCEPT SYKES
WILL ANTICIPATE THAT.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.695
HE'LL BE EXPECTING YOU
TO COME AFTER HIM,

29:59.795 --> 30:01.074
WHICH MEANS
HE'LL PROBABLY
BE LYING IN WAIT.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.244
MAYBE EVEN SET
SOME KIND OF TRAP.

30:03.345 --> 30:05.250
ONE THAT YOU COULD IDENTIFY.

30:05.350 --> 30:07.147
SO LET'S GO.

30:08.358 --> 30:10.072
WAIT. DON'T
WE NEED PHOEBE?

30:11.365 --> 30:12.938
NO, ALL WE NEED IS THIS.

30:13.038 --> 30:14.416
BESIDES, IT'S BETTER TO KEEP
EMMA AWAY FROM THE ACTION.

30:18.384 --> 30:21.878
OH, HONEY. WHAT HAPPENED?

30:21.978 --> 30:23.841
SYKES.

30:23.941 --> 30:25.570
GUESS YOU WERE RIGHT.

30:26.866 --> 30:27.936
OH, SWEETIE,
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RIGHT.

30:28.036 --> 30:31.317
I'M SORRY.

30:31.418 --> 30:32.631
YOU'RE SORRY?
WHO'S GONNA
PAY FOR THIS?

30:33.132 --> 30:35.347
WELL?

30:36.431 --> 30:37.544
WE'RE GONNA GO AFTER SYKES,

30:37.644 --> 30:39.048
SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
ORB SUSAN OUT OF HERE

30:39.148 --> 30:41.444
JUST TO BE SAFE.

31:06.428 --> 31:09.460
EMMA?

31:09.560 --> 31:11.548
EMMA, PLEASE,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

31:11.649 --> 31:13.527
LOOK, I KNOW
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY

31:14.530 --> 31:16.395
THAT CAN CHANGE
WHAT HAPPENED,

31:16.495 --> 31:18.440
BUT I THINK THERE IS
SOMETHING THAT MAY HELP.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.546
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

31:21.800 --> 31:23.037
THAT COLE HAS DEDICATED
HIS LIFE TO GOOD NOW.

31:23.137 --> 31:25.710
AND I'M NOT SAYING
THAT IT EXCUSES
WHAT HE DID.

31:25.810 --> 31:28.885
DAMN RIGHT,
IT DOESN'T.

31:28.986 --> 31:30.306
ALL I'M SAYING
IS THE DEMON
YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR

31:30.406 --> 31:32.228
NO LONGER EXISTS.

31:32.328 --> 31:33.856
OH, MY GOD.

31:33.957 --> 31:35.528
WHO ARE YOU
TRYING TO KID?

31:35.628 --> 31:37.533
ARE YOU BLIND?
DID YOU NOT SEE
WHAT HE TURNED INTO?

31:37.633 --> 31:40.498
THAT MONSTER STILL EXISTS
WHETHER YOU WANT
TO BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

31:40.598 --> 31:43.716
TECHNICALLY,
YES, BUT--

31:43.816 --> 31:45.721
NOT TECHNICALLY.
ACTUALLY.

31:45.822 --> 31:48.519
HE'S ALIVE, AND I'M NOT
GONNA REST UNTIL HE'S DEAD,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY.

31:48.619 --> 31:52.255
ALL THAT WOULD DO
IS KEEP HIM FROM
DOING FUTURE GOOD.

31:52.629 --> 31:56.600
AND PUT YOUR LIFE
AT RISK IN THE PROCESS.

31:57.184 --> 32:00.861
EMMA, PLEASE.
PLEASE. LET IT GO.

32:03.242 --> 32:04.871
LET IT GO?

32:07.085 --> 32:08.255
HAVE YOU EVER LOST SOMEONE?

32:11.263 --> 32:14.587
TO EVIL, I MEAN?

32:14.687 --> 32:16.527
YES.

32:17.905 --> 32:18.908
AND DID YOU JUST...LET IT GO?

32:38.333 --> 32:41.657
ANY SIGN OF HIM?

32:41.757 --> 32:43.555
UH-UH.

32:46.647 --> 32:49.678
OW!

32:49.778 --> 32:51.392
WHAT?

32:51.493 --> 32:52.786
TRAP. BACK UP.

33:09.247 --> 33:12.573
WHERE IS HE?

33:12.673 --> 33:15.120
I DON'T KNOW.

33:15.221 --> 33:16.667
WELL, WHY WOULD HE
SET A TRAP FOR US
AND NOT BE HERE?

33:16.768 --> 33:18.854
UNLESS THIS IS
JUST A DISTRACTION.

33:19.857 --> 33:21.762
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN,
DISTRACTION?

33:21.862 --> 33:23.183
YOU SAID
HE WAS AFTER US.

33:23.284 --> 33:24.769
I WAS WRONG.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.735
HE'S AFTER ME.

33:26.835 --> 33:27.878
AND THE BEST WAY
TO GET TO ME
IS THROUGH--

33:28.923 --> 33:30.762
PHOEBE.

33:34.187 --> 33:37.387
COLE?

33:37.488 --> 33:38.906
CLOSE.

33:40.788 --> 33:42.358
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

33:42.458 --> 33:43.879
SAME THING YOU DO.
ONLY I CALL HIM BELTHAZOR.

33:46.846 --> 33:50.730
EXCEPT I DON'T NEED
A POTION TO VANQUISH HIM.

33:51.399 --> 33:54.908
I JUST NEED YOU.

34:01.801 --> 34:04.874
PHOEBE.

34:04.974 --> 34:07.231
I'LL CHECK UPSTAIRS.
YOU CHECK
DOWNSTAIRS.

34:09.404 --> 34:12.995
YOU MUST BE SOMETHING
VERY SPECIAL, TURN A DEMON.

34:16.505 --> 34:18.092
SOMETHING
VERY SPECIAL INDEED.

34:20.139 --> 34:23.398
UNFORTUNATELY, THOUGH,
WHEN YOU MADE HIM LESS EVIL,

34:23.690 --> 34:27.199
YOU MADE HIM LESS POWERFUL.

34:28.034 --> 34:29.163
HMM. I WONDER...

34:32.213 --> 34:34.050
YOU GONNA HAVE
THE SAME EFFECT ON ME
AFTER I KILL HIM?

34:37.268 --> 34:39.231
HMM?

34:40.820 --> 34:42.322
WELL, WELL, WELL.
THE MIGHTY BELTHAZOR.

34:44.663 --> 34:48.005
YOU DON'T DISAPPOINT.
I KNEW YOU'D FIGURE OUT
WHAT I WAS UP TO

34:48.840 --> 34:51.998
SOONER OR LATER.

34:52.098 --> 34:54.630
COLE, GET OUT OF HERE.

34:54.731 --> 34:56.217
HE WON'T HURT ME.
HE'S BLUFFING.

34:56.318 --> 34:59.015
Cole and Sykes:
I CAN'T TAKE
THAT CHANCE.

34:59.115 --> 35:00.662
OOH. IT'S KIND OF EERIE,
ISN'T IT?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.028
HOW I KNOW YOU BETTER
THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF?

35:04.128 --> 35:07.330
THE STUDENT
HAS SURPASSED HIS MENTOR.

35:07.430 --> 35:10.044
I WAS NEVER
YOUR MENTOR, SYKES.

35:10.144 --> 35:12.049
BY REPUTATION, YOU WERE.

35:12.149 --> 35:13.806
BY YOUR LEGEND.
IT'LL BE AN HONOR TO KILL YOU

35:13.906 --> 35:17.749
AND ASSUME YOUR RIGHTFUL PLACE
IN THE HIERARCHY.

35:22.218 --> 35:25.460
REMEMBER
WHAT I TOLD YOU?
WHAT I ASKED YOU TO DO?

35:25.560 --> 35:29.194
COLE, PLEASE DON'T.

35:29.738 --> 35:30.700
AAH!

35:39.096 --> 35:42.396
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

35:44.109 --> 35:47.241
AAH!

35:52.757 --> 35:55.915
DIE!

35:56.015 --> 35:57.561
COLE!

36:27.806 --> 36:31.065
AAH!

36:34.950 --> 36:38.251
COLE?

36:40.548 --> 36:44.390
IT'S OVER. YOU CAN
TURN BACK NOW.

36:46.772 --> 36:50.448
COLE, YOU CAN DO IT.
FOR ME. FOR US.

36:51.659 --> 36:54.125
HURRY! THROW THE POTION!
MAYBE IT'LL WORK ON HIM!

36:55.670 --> 36:57.534
NO, DON'T!
COLE, PLEASE!

36:57.634 --> 36:59.472
YOU CAN DO THIS.
YOU'RE GOOD.

37:00.266 --> 37:02.063
AAH!

37:09.081 --> 37:12.339
AAH!

37:21.738 --> 37:25.106
WHAT HAPPENED?

37:25.206 --> 37:26.583
THAT WAS THE POWER
STRIPPING POTION

37:27.670 --> 37:30.302
I MADE TO FREE COLE.

37:30.887 --> 37:32.683
ARE YOU OK?

37:41.538 --> 37:44.530
NO!

37:44.631 --> 37:45.801
YOU GOT YOUR REVENGE.

37:47.263 --> 37:48.558
YOU KILLED THE DEMON
YOU WERE AFTER.

37:49.853 --> 37:51.900
BELTHAZOR IS DEAD.
GONE FOREVER.

37:58.835 --> 38:02.370
COLE'S A HUMAN BEING.

38:02.470 --> 38:04.599
AN INNOCENT.

38:37.477 --> 38:41.096
YOU KNOW, THIS BABY
WAS YOUR IDEA.

38:41.196 --> 38:44.854
I KNOW, I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I'M PAYING
FOR HALF OF IT.

38:44.955 --> 38:48.155
STILL HAVEN'T
QUITE FIGURED OUT

38:48.255 --> 38:49.616
HOW I'M GONNA EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT, THOUGH.

38:49.716 --> 38:51.640
THANK YOU.

38:52.892 --> 38:54.548
WELL, AT LEAST
IT SERVED
ITS PURPOSE.

38:54.648 --> 38:56.634
IN SPADES, UNFORTUNATELY.

38:56.734 --> 38:58.700
OH, HONEY,
IT DOESN'T MEAN

38:59.742 --> 39:00.645
THAT WE CAN'T
EVER HAVE CHILDREN.

39:00.745 --> 39:02.442
JUST, YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE TO WAIT
TILL IT'S SAFE.

39:02.543 --> 39:04.698
PROMISE?

39:04.798 --> 39:06.052
PROMISE.

39:07.222 --> 39:08.475
AH, THAT'S SWEET.
YOU TWO OUGHTA GET MARRIED.

39:09.768 --> 39:12.860
UNLIKE PHOEBE AND COLE.

39:13.279 --> 39:15.784
YOU DON'T THINK
THEY SHOULD?

39:16.871 --> 39:18.150
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS IT'S
NOT MY BUSINESS.

39:18.250 --> 39:20.865
PROBABLY JUST REELING
FROM THE FACT THAT
COLE KILLED PEOPLE.

39:20.966 --> 39:24.041
YEAH, BUT
THAT WASN'T COLE.
IT WAS BELTHAZOR.

39:24.141 --> 39:26.712
SPLITTIN' HAIRS,
IF YOU ASK ME.

39:26.813 --> 39:29.137
IT'S NOT, THOUGH.

39:29.237 --> 39:30.849
HIS HUMAN HALF
HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
TO DO WITH ANY OF THAT.

39:30.950 --> 39:33.523
IT WAS
TOTALLY SUBJUGATED.

39:33.623 --> 39:35.736
PHOEBE'S RIGHT.
HE'S AN INNOCENT.

39:35.836 --> 39:37.509
QUESTION IS,
WHAT DOES HE DO NOW?

39:52.881 --> 39:56.710
COLE. OH, MY GOD!
I WAS SO WORRIED.

39:56.810 --> 40:00.611
OH, I'M SORRY.
I JUST HAD TO
TAKE A WALK,

40:00.902 --> 40:04.354
AND I LOST
TRACK OF TIME.

40:04.454 --> 40:06.817
AND I TRIED
TO SHIMMER BACK HERE,

40:06.917 --> 40:08.155
AND I REALIZED I--

40:08.256 --> 40:09.826
I DIDN'T HAVE
MY POWERS ANYMORE.

40:09.926 --> 40:12.082
BUT THAT'S A GOOD THING.

40:12.182 --> 40:14.422
ISN'T THAT
WHAT WE ALWAYS WANTED?

40:14.522 --> 40:15.884
I DON'T KNOW.

40:15.984 --> 40:18.490
DID WE? I MEAN, I GET IT
THAT I'M FINALLY OFF
THE SOURCE'S RADAR

40:19.703 --> 40:23.362
AND THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

40:23.462 --> 40:24.531
DEMONS TRACKING ME DOWN
ALL THE TIME.

40:24.631 --> 40:26.386
BUT...I--I'M
GRATEFUL FOR THAT,
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

40:27.849 --> 40:31.023
IT'S JUST...

40:34.616 --> 40:37.817
WHAT?

40:37.917 --> 40:39.127
COME HERE.

40:43.011 --> 40:46.338
PHOEBE, UM...

40:46.438 --> 40:50.030
FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES,
I'VE BEEN A DEMON
FOR OVER 100 YEARS.

40:51.201 --> 40:55.043
THAT'S ALL I'VE
EVER KNOWN...OR BEEN.

40:56.339 --> 40:58.051
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW?

41:00.056 --> 41:02.021
WHO AM I?

41:03.232 --> 41:05.220
WELL, YOU'RE STILL
THE GOOD MAN THAT
I FELL IN LOVE WITH.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.788
BUT NOT THE ONE
YOU WANT TO MARRY.

41:13.090 --> 41:16.501
I LOVE YOU, COLE.

41:16.601 --> 41:19.859
AND NOTHING WILL
EVER CHANGE THAT.

41:20.108 --> 41:21.655
BUT I'M NOT READY.
NOT YET.

41:23.828 --> 41:27.838
AND THAT'S GOT MORE
TO DO WITH ME
AND MY ISSUES

41:28.966 --> 41:32.165
THAN IT DOES YOU.

41:32.266 --> 41:33.896
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT LEAVES US,
ESPECIALLY NOW.

41:36.151 --> 41:37.571
WELL, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT A DEMON
ANYMORE,

41:40.161 --> 41:44.171
DOESN'T MEAN WE
CAN'T LIVE IN SIN.
