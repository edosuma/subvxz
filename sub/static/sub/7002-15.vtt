00:05.971 --> 00:09.007
Oh, boys, come on.
What are you doing?

00:09.008 --> 00:11.175
This is our one morning
to sleep in.

00:11.176 --> 00:15.914
Whoa, you guys really
look nasty in the morning.

00:15.915 --> 00:17.782
Did you look this bad
when you met?

00:17.783 --> 00:21.319
Your mom did.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.056
Tim, please. It smells
like a sea bass died.

00:25.057 --> 00:27.759
<i>(hisses)</i>

00:27.760 --> 00:29.828
What are you guys doing
banging around down here?

00:29.829 --> 00:33.498
We made you a special
breakfast. Sit down.

00:33.499 --> 00:36.134
What did you do?
Nothing.

00:36.135 --> 00:39.037
Come on, what did
you guys break?
Nothing.

00:39.038 --> 00:42.573
Whose cat did
you shave?
No one's.

00:42.574 --> 00:45.910
Mom, this is yours.
Dad, this one's yours.

00:45.911 --> 00:47.012
It is, huh?

00:47.013 --> 00:48.546
Does this have anything
to do with me putting

00:48.547 --> 00:50.615
That tabasco sauce
in your ice cream?

00:50.616 --> 00:53.752
Of course not, father.

00:55.021 --> 00:57.856
I enjoyed that prank.

00:57.857 --> 01:00.458
So did I. It was cool.
Oh, boy.

01:00.459 --> 01:02.894
Oh, mrs. Boucher's dog.
Get out of the yard!

01:02.895 --> 01:05.363
Come on! Get out of there,
you stupid dog!

01:05.364 --> 01:09.267
Ha-ha! Oh, go on now!
I don't see
any dog out there.

01:09.268 --> 01:11.302
Oh, he slipped right
through the bushes there.

01:11.303 --> 01:13.805
Well, let's dig in.

01:13.806 --> 01:16.675
Mom, allow me.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.146
Go ahead, honey.

01:29.755 --> 01:31.723
They're delicious.
They are?

01:31.724 --> 01:33.457
They're really good.
Cool.

01:33.458 --> 01:36.161
You should try it.
Yeah, dad. Dig in.

02:54.206 --> 02:57.008
<i>(jill) well, what do</i>
<i>you think? Could we put</i>
<i>the kids in the middle?</i>

03:00.980 --> 03:02.580
Hi, mom.
Hey, mom.

03:02.581 --> 03:04.315
Hi, guys. How was school?

03:04.316 --> 03:07.886
Great. They announced
that summer vacation
begins in February.

03:07.887 --> 03:11.489
Yeah, and no one ever has
to do homework ever again.

03:11.490 --> 03:15.193
That's nice. What else?

03:15.194 --> 03:18.229
Randy's gonna be
in a talent show.
Shut up.

03:18.230 --> 03:20.665
You're gonna be in a talent
show? That's so cool!

03:20.666 --> 03:22.167
What are you gonna do?
You gonna, sing, tap-dance?

03:22.168 --> 03:23.434
Do you need my help?

03:23.435 --> 03:26.271
No. I'm gonna be doing
a ventriloquist act.

03:26.272 --> 03:29.507
I love ventriloquists!

03:29.508 --> 03:33.411
When I was growing up, I used
to watch them all the time on
<i>ed sullivan.</i>

03:33.412 --> 03:35.680
Who?

03:35.681 --> 03:39.217
Never mind. You're gonna look
so cute holding a dummy.

03:39.218 --> 03:43.387
He finally gets to work
with somebody his own size.

03:43.388 --> 03:47.091
Yeah, and somebody
with your iq.

03:47.092 --> 03:50.494
Randy, you don't know anything
about being a ventriloquist.

03:50.495 --> 03:51.830
I'll read about it.

03:51.831 --> 03:54.498
You see, brad, the library
has these new things.

03:54.499 --> 03:57.168
They're called books.

03:57.169 --> 04:00.671
They're like comics,
but they don't have pictures.

04:00.672 --> 04:02.807
Hey, come on, guys.
Cut it out.

04:02.808 --> 04:05.509
Randy, I'm really proud of you.
You're trying a new thing.

04:05.510 --> 04:06.744
This is great.

04:06.745 --> 04:09.280
Honey, I'm home!

04:09.281 --> 04:11.415
You are so weird.
Thanks.

04:11.416 --> 04:14.352
Hey, guys.
What's up?

04:14.353 --> 04:18.022
Randy's doing a ventriloquist
act at school.

04:18.023 --> 04:20.291
Great. Where are you
gonna get the dummy?

04:20.291 --> 04:22.827
Uh-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu.

04:22.828 --> 04:24.762
Can I carve you one?

04:24.763 --> 04:27.198
I could make you a lifelike
little friend out of 100%
american pine.

04:27.199 --> 04:28.366
You could?

04:28.367 --> 04:29.868
Yeah. You've seen what
I can do with my hands.

04:29.869 --> 04:33.338
Yeah, but I don't want you
to make the dummy explode.

04:35.174 --> 04:36.674
Do you want me to carve
it for you or not?

04:36.675 --> 04:37.742
Yeah.
Cool.

04:37.743 --> 04:40.511
Thanks, dad.
Let's do it.

04:40.512 --> 04:43.581
What's all this?
A compatibility test.

04:43.582 --> 04:46.317
A compatibility test.
Yes.

04:46.318 --> 04:50.388
It's so women can tell if
they're in a relationship
with the right man.

04:50.389 --> 04:54.259
It's for the special valentine's
issue of next month's magazine.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.127
"how does your mate rate?"

04:56.128 --> 04:59.663
How do you rate a guy
who's already an ace?

04:59.664 --> 05:02.267
I think you
mispronounced that.

05:06.071 --> 05:08.172
Don't worry, honey -
you did great on the test.

05:08.173 --> 05:11.542
I didn't take this test yet.
I know. Men don't
take the test.

05:11.543 --> 05:13.912
Women take the test
for the men.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.580
So you think up the test,
and then you answer your
own questions.

05:16.581 --> 05:18.716
Very fair.
Thank you.

05:18.717 --> 05:20.218
Who thought of this?

05:20.219 --> 05:23.321
Me and about five
other people.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.123
Were there any men
involved in this group?

05:25.124 --> 05:30.428
No. But arlene and vickie have
very strong masculine sides.

05:30.429 --> 05:33.197
A little quiz for women to show
how stupid their husbands are.

05:33.198 --> 05:34.832
No, it's fun.

05:34.833 --> 05:38.769
You get points, you know,
for all the different answers.

05:38.770 --> 05:42.706
You could rate anywhere
from "knight in shining armor"

05:42.707 --> 05:44.475
To "neanderthal."

05:44.476 --> 05:46.444
Well, you took it for me.
How'd I do?

05:46.445 --> 05:49.647
98.
<i>(grunting)</i> yeah!

05:49.648 --> 05:51.449
Out of 300.

05:54.386 --> 05:56.421
Ok.

05:56.422 --> 05:59.757
"if your husband were something
you'd find in the kitchen, what
would he be?"

05:59.758 --> 06:01.826
Oh, that's deep.
Oh, yeah, that's deep.

06:01.827 --> 06:04.562
I think you'll find this
very insightful, tim.

06:04.563 --> 06:08.032
"a: An oven - warm and
self-cleaning." not me.

06:08.033 --> 06:13.471
"b: A garbage disposal -
grating and eats anything."

06:13.472 --> 06:16.540
"c: A refrigerator - very cold
and the light's never on."

06:20.079 --> 06:22.947
These are stupid.
Well, come on!

06:22.948 --> 06:26.150
You haven't read the one
I picked for you. Read d.

06:26.151 --> 06:31.022
"d: A tea kettle - hot and
steamy, done in two minutes."

06:37.229 --> 06:39.930
Like I'm a tea kettle.

06:39.931 --> 06:43.167
Well, honey, you do whistle
when you're done.

06:49.674 --> 06:51.876
One layer at a time there.

06:51.877 --> 06:54.078
Good.

06:54.079 --> 06:58.983
Al has been showing us some real
craftsmanship on this wood lathe
today.

06:58.984 --> 07:01.419
Al, do you suppose if you
couldn't pay for this all
at once,

07:01.420 --> 07:06.024
You'd have to put it
on "lathe away"?

07:06.025 --> 07:09.527
I don't think so, tim.

07:09.528 --> 07:11.829
Anyway, a lathe
is a very amazing machine.

07:11.830 --> 07:13.631
You can turn out all sorts
of interesting products,

07:13.632 --> 07:16.067
From table legs
to baseball bats,

07:16.068 --> 07:18.769
Just like this beautiful
american ash bat we made today.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.272
Boy, I love baseball. As a kid,
I used to love playing it.

07:21.273 --> 07:23.707
Klaus, let's have
some ambient baseball noise.

07:23.708 --> 07:27.245
<i>(crowd chatter/organ)</i>

07:43.562 --> 07:45.063
<i>(bat cracking/crowd cheers)</i>

07:49.401 --> 07:52.836
Right over the wall, al.
A tape-measure job.

07:52.837 --> 07:54.872
Here, take a swing, buddy.
Come on!

07:54.873 --> 07:57.575
Come on.
Come on, buddy.

08:02.981 --> 08:05.883
Come on, buddy. Keep your
eye on the ball, buddy.

08:05.884 --> 08:08.386
<i>(sound of baseball</i>
<i>hitting glove)</i>

08:08.387 --> 08:10.121
<i>(audience jeers)</i>

08:10.122 --> 08:12.957
Strike, al.
Those high hard ones are tough.

08:12.958 --> 08:14.758
Take another shot.
Come on. Come on.

08:20.466 --> 08:22.967
<i>(baseball hitting glove)</i>

08:22.968 --> 08:25.002
Two strikes on you.
Don't worry about it, buddy.
You're it.

08:25.003 --> 08:26.537
Come on, al.

08:26.538 --> 08:27.538
<i>(baseball whizzes by/</i>
<i>hits glove)</i>

08:27.539 --> 08:32.176
All right, al,
you are out of here!

08:32.177 --> 08:34.445
Maybe I can salvage this.

08:36.982 --> 08:39.850
<i>(bat hits baseball/</i>
<i>crowd cheers)</i>

08:39.851 --> 08:41.852
Ground rule double, buddy.

08:43.989 --> 08:45.556
Well, enough foolishness though.

08:45.557 --> 08:48.292
But with a lathe,
you can build your own bat.

08:48.293 --> 08:51.129
Yes, and tailor it to
your own individual grip.

08:51.130 --> 08:54.565
That way you know that you
and the bat are compatible,

08:54.566 --> 08:58.603
Unlike a woman, who has to
take a quiz out of a magazine

08:58.604 --> 09:00.971
To figure out who she's
compatible with.

09:00.972 --> 09:04.208
<i>(feminine voice)</i>
"if my husband was a pie,

09:04.209 --> 09:07.411
What kind of pie would he be?"

09:07.412 --> 09:11.149
I'm not a pie! Men aren't pies!
Are you a pie, al?

09:11.150 --> 09:13.317
Well, I'm a pisces.

09:17.289 --> 09:20.291
Thank you, al. You men know what
I'm talking about. I'm right.

09:20.292 --> 09:23.127
We don't have to go through a
quiz to figure out who we like.

09:23.128 --> 09:25.996
We see a woman. We go,
"do I wanna take a bath with her

09:25.997 --> 09:28.432
Or introduce her
to my sister?"

09:28.433 --> 09:31.769
That's "tim taylor,
care of <i>tool time,</i>
po box 32733--"

09:31.770 --> 09:33.937
Give it a rest, al.
Al, give it a rest.

09:33.938 --> 09:35.473
Can we get back
to our project?

09:35.474 --> 09:37.441
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry.

09:37.442 --> 09:40.144
I don't think we have enough
time, actually, to turn this
leg for them.

09:40.145 --> 09:42.746
Why don't you just show them
the leg you turned earlier
today?

09:42.747 --> 09:47.017
This is a beautiful example that
al turned today out of maple.
I love it.

09:47.018 --> 09:49.253
But al's not the only one
that can turn a leg, though.

09:49.254 --> 09:52.856
Earlier, I made this leg out
of a perfect piece of ash.

09:56.295 --> 10:00.030
She sells, sea shells,
down by the seashore.

10:00.031 --> 10:02.733
I saw your lips move.
Hey, shut up.

10:02.734 --> 10:04.868
They moved again.

10:04.869 --> 10:07.672
How's it going?
He stinks.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.540
Mark, we're a family.
We support each other.

10:09.541 --> 10:11.041
Your brother doesn't stink.

10:11.042 --> 10:12.443
Yes, I do.

10:12.444 --> 10:14.745
Told you.

10:14.746 --> 10:16.347
You can see my lips move.

10:16.348 --> 10:18.516
Honey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.884
Edgar bergen didn't
learn this in a day.

10:20.885 --> 10:23.153
<i>(both)</i> who?

10:23.154 --> 10:25.256
Just keep practicing.

10:25.257 --> 10:28.593
Tim, where have you been?
You're late.

10:28.594 --> 10:31.495
Hi, honey. I was doing
some important research.

10:31.496 --> 10:33.197
Oh, really?
Yeah.

10:33.198 --> 10:35.333
I don't think it's fair

10:35.334 --> 10:37.568
That women make up all
these quizzes about men.

10:37.569 --> 10:40.504
So I made up this
little quiz about women.

10:40.505 --> 10:43.006
Like my "how does your mate
rate" test?

10:43.007 --> 10:48.045
Yeah, I'm gonna call it,
"is your life more rife with
strife because of your wife?"

10:48.046 --> 10:50.648
What scientific mind
came up with this one?

10:50.649 --> 10:52.450
Me and a couple of
the guys at work. You know,

10:52.451 --> 10:55.152
Howe, leroy, moose.

10:55.153 --> 10:57.221
Moose? Isn't he
that crane operator

10:57.222 --> 10:59.790
Who rides a motorcycle and has,
like, a tattoo on his shoulder?

10:59.791 --> 11:03.160
Yes, but he has some
very strong feminine sides.

11:04.696 --> 11:06.697
Now we came up with
a rating system.

11:06.698 --> 11:13.036
It goes from cavewoman
to bambi the love goddess.

11:13.037 --> 11:14.938
"bambi the love goddess"?

11:14.939 --> 11:19.644
I take it there aren't any
math questions on this quiz.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.679
You got that right.
<i>(laughs)</i>

11:21.680 --> 11:24.047
All right. "does your wife
nag you more or less than

11:24.048 --> 11:26.584
Six times during
a football game?"

11:26.585 --> 11:28.319
More.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.120
I never nag you during
a football game.
Hey, hey, hey.

11:30.121 --> 11:32.523
I'm taking this
for you, ok?

11:32.524 --> 11:34.759
"how many times has your wife
nagged you during this quiz?"

11:34.760 --> 11:35.826
Oh, this is so stupid.

11:35.827 --> 11:39.563
Well, that'd be
two times right there.

11:39.564 --> 11:41.766
Now the scientific part.

11:41.767 --> 11:45.369
"if your wife were
a piece of hockey equipment,
what would she be?"

11:45.370 --> 11:47.338
Let me see that!

11:47.339 --> 11:52.576
<i>(laughing)</i> "if your wife were
a piece of hockey equipment,
would she be?

11:52.577 --> 11:57.381
"a: A goalie mask -
wiry and closed off.

11:57.382 --> 11:59.617
"b: A stick -

11:59.618 --> 12:02.886
"long, rigid
and likes to hit things.

12:04.323 --> 12:06.290
"c: Elbow pads -

12:06.291 --> 12:10.494
Soft, flexible,
and a good housekeeper"?

12:10.495 --> 12:13.798
What does housekeeping
have to do with elbow pads?

12:13.799 --> 12:15.499
Takes care of the joint.

12:20.238 --> 12:22.973
This is great.
You're so pathetic.

12:22.974 --> 12:25.376
Read the next one.
"d: A jock strap -

12:25.377 --> 12:29.313
Gets in the way a lot,
but basically supportive."

12:34.285 --> 12:37.655
And you fell right in-between
elbow pads and a jock strap.

12:37.656 --> 12:39.824
Well, thank you so much.
I'm so honored.

12:39.825 --> 12:44.662
<i>(sighs)</i> I'm sorry, punkster,
but that's the best you did,
right there.

12:44.663 --> 12:48.165
According to my little quiz
here, you and I are just not
compatible.

12:48.166 --> 12:51.502
Well, I don't need a test
to tell me that. How'd I do?

12:51.503 --> 12:53.671
88.
Out of what?

12:53.672 --> 12:55.606
Seven million.

12:58.543 --> 13:02.079
So I guess I'm not bambi
the love goddess, huh?

13:02.080 --> 13:04.214
Actually, you'll need
ten more points

13:04.215 --> 13:07.184
To catch up to tina
the inflatable party doll.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.658
Ok, it says in order to
pronounce the letter v
without moving your lips,

13:14.659 --> 13:19.296
Make a gentle cough
followed by a soft g.

13:19.297 --> 13:22.633
Uh, try to say,
"hi, aunt vivian."

13:24.436 --> 13:26.570
Hi, aunt...

13:26.571 --> 13:28.839
<i>(coughs)</i> ...G-I...

13:28.840 --> 13:31.008
<i>(coughs)</i> ...Ian.

13:31.009 --> 13:32.543
Very good.

13:32.544 --> 13:34.745
See, mom?
I can't do this.

13:34.746 --> 13:37.481
Besides, I feel like an idiot
talking to a hanger.

13:37.482 --> 13:39.016
Well, you shouldn't think
of it as a hanger.

13:39.017 --> 13:42.152
You should think of it
as a real living person.

13:42.153 --> 13:43.521
We should give it a name.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.924
How about hanger?

13:46.925 --> 13:49.593
Mom, a hanger
can't have a name.
Yes it can. Yes, it can.

13:49.594 --> 13:51.061
Here, let me try this.

13:51.062 --> 13:54.031
Ok, we're gonna
call this guy... Spanky.

13:54.032 --> 13:56.500
How are you doing, spanky?

13:56.501 --> 13:58.235
Not bad.

13:58.236 --> 14:00.103
What's your favorite
nursery rhyme?

14:00.104 --> 14:03.908
♪ mary had a little lamb ♪

14:05.877 --> 14:09.480
That was great, mom.
Harry had a little ham.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.882
Ok, wise guy,

14:11.883 --> 14:14.552
You go up and work on this or
you're not gonna get any dinner.

14:14.553 --> 14:17.254
Why, what are we having?
Heat loaf?

14:17.255 --> 14:21.191
Tim, tim. On your way to work
will you pick up this
dry cleaning?

14:21.192 --> 14:24.027
Yep.
Thank you.

14:24.028 --> 14:25.996
Oh, uh...
By the way,

14:25.997 --> 14:27.698
The other day when I was talking
about being incompatible,

14:27.699 --> 14:30.267
You know I was
just joking around.
Good.

14:30.268 --> 14:33.904
You were kidding, too,
weren't you?

14:33.905 --> 14:35.940
No.

14:35.941 --> 14:39.877
But you're kidding now?

14:39.878 --> 14:42.379
No.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.214
Well, if we're
so incompatible,

14:44.215 --> 14:46.750
How is it we got along
for 14 years?

14:46.751 --> 14:50.988
Well, I'm an exceptional woman
and I make all the compromises.

14:50.989 --> 14:54.592
Back the marriage carriage up
here a little bit.

14:54.593 --> 14:55.993
You make all
the compromises.

14:55.994 --> 14:58.762
Yeah. We always do
what you wanna do.
No we don't.

14:58.763 --> 15:02.299
Yeah. I went to that
truck-pushing thing with you.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.636
Truck-pulling. Pull.
Whatever.

15:05.637 --> 15:07.404
I go to the opera with you.

15:07.405 --> 15:09.907
Once. I've been to
three rambo movies.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.175
When was the last time you
took me to foreign film?

15:12.176 --> 15:17.114
Didn't we just
see <i>le robocop?</i>

15:17.115 --> 15:21.284
I let you hang that
ugly picture up there.

15:21.285 --> 15:24.187
Ugly? That's
the monterey grand prix '64.

15:24.188 --> 15:26.023
It's one of a kind.
That's worth some coin.

15:26.024 --> 15:29.493
Good, then sell it.
You can hang up the quarter.

15:29.494 --> 15:33.263
Oh! I let you put percale
sheets up in the bedroom.

15:33.264 --> 15:36.199
I wanted "heroes of the nfl."

15:36.200 --> 15:41.371
Like I want to sleep for the
rest of my life on dick butkus.

15:41.372 --> 15:44.775
Think about it.

15:44.776 --> 15:48.245
We haven't even talked about
the biggest compromise of all,
the kids.

15:48.246 --> 15:49.947
How are the boys
a compromise?

15:49.948 --> 15:53.884
I wanted girls, you wanted boys.
I gave you boys.

15:57.822 --> 16:00.658
Yo, wilson,
you over there?
Right here, tim.

16:00.659 --> 16:02.660
Have you finished painting
that dummy for randy yet?

16:02.661 --> 16:04.094
Hm-hm, almost.
I must say

16:04.095 --> 16:07.798
You did a wonderful job
of carving it.
Thanks, buddy.

16:07.799 --> 16:10.834
Oh, I've always been a big
fan of ventriloquism.

16:10.835 --> 16:15.238
A noble art from the latin
words <i>venter</i> and <i>loqui.</i>

16:15.239 --> 16:17.107
Meaning to speak
from the belly.

16:17.108 --> 16:21.045
I do that after
I eat mexican food.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.047
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

16:23.048 --> 16:26.684
Mind if I ask you something?
Throw your voice,
good neighbor.

16:26.685 --> 16:30.454
Jill's taken this stupid test
that says we're not compatible.

16:30.455 --> 16:32.155
I know we
love each other.
Mm-hm.

16:32.156 --> 16:34.692
I just wonder how we stay
together if were so different.

16:34.693 --> 16:38.328
Well, tim, much of it has to
do with the unity of opposites,

16:38.329 --> 16:40.430
The yin and the yang.

16:40.431 --> 16:43.901
Those two pandas at
the washington zoo?

16:43.902 --> 16:48.238
Oh, no, tim, that would be
ling ling and hsing hsing.

16:48.239 --> 16:50.207
<i>(sing-song voice)</i>
oh, hsing hsing...
Yes.

16:50.208 --> 16:53.978
What I'm talking about is
the paradox of a relationship,

16:53.979 --> 16:57.514
And a paradox is not
necessarily a bad thing.

16:57.515 --> 17:01.018
A paradox is not
necessarily a bad thing.

17:01.019 --> 17:03.887
Mm-hm. There you go, neighbor.
A paradox creates tension

17:03.888 --> 17:06.356
And tension is energy
and energy is a force

17:06.357 --> 17:07.657
And we all live in this force

17:07.659 --> 17:11.095
And that's the excitement
of life and love.

17:11.096 --> 17:13.797
Are you with me, tim?
You're saying...

17:13.798 --> 17:16.733
A paradox is not
necessarily a bad thing.

17:16.734 --> 17:22.673
Mm-hm. Tim I believe it was
andré maurois who said

17:22.674 --> 17:24.974
That a successful marriage
is an edifice

17:24.976 --> 17:27.144
That must be rebuilt everyday.

17:27.145 --> 17:30.681
And I like rebuilding, boy.
Hammer, hammer, saw, hammer...

17:30.682 --> 17:32.750
That's because you have
an edifice complex.

17:32.751 --> 17:37.087
<i>(wilson laughs)</i> oh, my gosh,
I do crack myself up sometimes.

17:37.088 --> 17:42.926
But I think what maurois was
trying to say is that there
is a deep chasm

17:42.927 --> 17:44.795
Between man and woman.

17:44.796 --> 17:48.598
And everyday we must build
a bridge and cross over to
the other side.

17:48.599 --> 17:50.634
But wouldn't that put jill
on my side and me on her side?

17:50.635 --> 17:52.670
No, no, no, tim.
In a successful marriage,

17:52.671 --> 17:55.572
Man and woman will
meet in the middle.

18:00.912 --> 18:03.213
Hi, randy.
Hi, mom.

18:03.214 --> 18:04.682
What's wrong?

18:04.683 --> 18:09.386
Well, the principal asked me
to do some ventriloquism.

18:09.387 --> 18:10.854
I tried to say,
"hi, aunt vivian,"

18:10.855 --> 18:13.090
And I coughed in her face.

18:13.091 --> 18:17.327
Hi, honey. Hey, randy.
Don't look. Don't look.

18:17.328 --> 18:19.196
I finished your dummy.

18:19.197 --> 18:22.066
And I think you're gonna
find this is the handsomest
dummy ever.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.367
You guys ready?

18:24.368 --> 18:27.838
Ta-da!

18:27.839 --> 18:30.140
Whoa!

18:33.712 --> 18:38.615
Wow, that's great, dad!
This is so amazing!

18:38.616 --> 18:40.851
Gosh, it's so real!

18:40.852 --> 18:42.686
It's hard to tell who is who.

18:45.890 --> 18:49.626
Aah!
Isn't it cool?

18:49.627 --> 18:53.630
Wow, that's great, dad.
But I'm not a very good
ventriloquist.

18:53.631 --> 18:55.833
My lips keep moving.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.768
That's why I designed it
this way. Watch.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.770
Your lips don't
have to move.

18:59.771 --> 19:04.608
Ok, tim jr.
Look over at me.
Thank you.

19:04.609 --> 19:06.576
How do you feel about
that more power?

19:06.577 --> 19:11.314
<i>(inquisitive grunting)</i>

19:11.315 --> 19:14.351
<i>(continues grunting)</i>

19:22.326 --> 19:25.095
Cool. I can do that.
I know you can.

19:25.096 --> 19:27.464
Try to work it out
upstairs, all right?

19:27.465 --> 19:29.967
In front of that big mirror
on your door.
Ok. Thanks, dad.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.402
You bet, buddy.
Tim, you outdid
yourself.

19:32.403 --> 19:33.737
Sometimes I do that.

19:33.738 --> 19:36.406
Listen, I got us some
videos and some pizza.

19:36.407 --> 19:38.942
Whoa, whoa, before you do
that... I've been thinking.

19:38.943 --> 19:41.145
What was the occasion?

19:41.146 --> 19:44.948
I think we're compatible, even
though you like percale sheets

19:44.949 --> 19:47.251
And I want to sleep
with dick butkus.

19:50.554 --> 19:54.024
Why are we compatible?
Because we choose to be.

19:54.025 --> 19:58.428
You and I are
a pair of ducks.

19:58.429 --> 20:01.498
And that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

20:01.499 --> 20:04.935
Pair of ducks.
Yes, yin and yang.

20:04.936 --> 20:07.737
They couldn't swim
the chism river, right?

20:07.738 --> 20:09.306
So they built this bridge

20:09.307 --> 20:12.176
And they sat up there
and quacked.

20:14.245 --> 20:16.246
A bridge. You're trying to
tell me you built a bridge?

20:16.247 --> 20:18.015
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't get me wrong.

20:18.016 --> 20:20.818
What we do is
we start over every day.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.519
I choose you,
you choose me.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.956
So we're, like, kind of
stuck with each other.

20:25.957 --> 20:28.959
Yes! And you know what?
With you...

20:28.960 --> 20:30.427
I don't mind compromising.

20:30.428 --> 20:32.395
I don't either.

20:32.396 --> 20:35.999
You know I've even started
liking those stupid, bloody
action films.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.734
Really?
Yeah.

20:37.735 --> 20:40.003
I wouldn't mind having
arnold schwarzenegger sheets.

20:40.004 --> 20:43.240
<i>(in austrian accent)</i> maria!

20:43.241 --> 20:45.843
And you know what? I like
going to the mall with you.

20:45.844 --> 20:48.979
Really?

20:48.980 --> 20:52.816
I kind of like
buying lingerie.

20:52.817 --> 20:56.153
<i>(whispers)</i> I think that
better stay our secret.

20:58.089 --> 21:00.690
Oh, you thought...
I see.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.943
All right, tim jr., now
let's do our impression

21:19.944 --> 21:23.747
Of a very bad
godzilla movie.

21:23.748 --> 21:26.216
Oh, no, godzilla.
Mothra's behind that building.

21:33.925 --> 21:37.327
Come on, honey.
You've had enough time
practicing with that thing.

21:37.328 --> 21:38.395
<i>(laughing)</i>

21:38.396 --> 21:41.098
Oh, tim!

21:43.201 --> 21:45.735
I love it!
'cause it looks like me.

21:45.736 --> 21:50.140
No, I mean mine!
Oh, jill jr.
I'm sorry.

21:50.141 --> 21:53.944
All right, tim jr.,
I'd like you to meet jill jr.

21:55.813 --> 21:57.281
<i>(both)</i> aah!

22:00.785 --> 22:04.421
<i>(laughs)</i> nice hair,

22:07.425 --> 22:10.794
Is that your face,
or do you have dutch elm
disease?

22:13.064 --> 22:15.565
Why don't you look at me
when you talk to me?

22:17.535 --> 22:20.637
<i>(jill laughing)</i>

22:20.638 --> 22:24.107
You're not a very good
ventriloquist.
I saw your lips moving.

22:24.108 --> 22:26.876
Why don't you come over here
and I'll show you how they do
ventriloquism in France?

22:26.877 --> 22:28.312
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.994
Hi, everybody.
