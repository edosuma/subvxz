00:01.102 --> 00:01.234
.

00:01.601 --> 00:02.503
- Hey, you have
a female attempted suicide?

00:03.971 --> 00:05.639
- Yeah, she just came in.

00:05.639 --> 00:08.141
- She's alive, barely.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.543
Gas inhalation.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.079
- We gotta get her to Med
right now.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.813
- Come on, let's go.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.448
- What is it about?

00:14.448 --> 00:17.085
- We need to be sure there's
nothing more going on here.

00:17.085 --> 00:20.188
- That attempted suicide?

00:20.188 --> 00:21.822
Dr. Charles--
he's not buying it.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.891
- What's not to buy?
You heard the report.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.696
- Today, three women,
all cancer-free,

00:28.696 --> 00:30.198
overdosed on chemo.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.699
- Clear.
- Clear.

00:31.699 --> 00:35.169
- Do you think a doctor's giving
false diagnoses and overdosing?

00:35.169 --> 00:37.505
- The police are on their way.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.110
- Jessica Pope, Carol Shepperd,
Dani Frank.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.011
Each brought independently
to Med

00:44.011 --> 00:45.813
with no connection
between 'em

00:45.813 --> 00:49.383
except an overdose of chemo
for a cancer they don't have.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.752
I wanna know
who prescribed that stuff.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.521
- 51 said
that the gas explosion

00:53.521 --> 00:55.889
in Jessica's apartment
caused a flashover.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.391
So there is nothing left
but char.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.660
There's no phone,
no laptop, no datebook.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.262
Nothing.
- No doctor's name.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.030
- We talked
to Dani Frank's girlfriend.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.364
They hadn't been dating
that long.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.633
She didn't know Dani's doctor.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.668
But she did say that
Dani was doing better

01:07.668 --> 01:09.570
until she took a turn,

01:09.570 --> 01:11.139
and when she confronted
her doctor about it

01:11.139 --> 01:13.040
he put her
on an experimental protocol

01:13.040 --> 01:14.408
that was supposed to beat it.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.678
- Sorry to interrupt.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.147
A new patient just
rolled into the ED.

01:19.147 --> 01:22.683
Unconscious, pancytopenic
just like the others.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.418
Look, I don't know
if this is legal,

01:24.418 --> 01:26.187
but, right now,
I really don't care.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.788
That's her stuff.
Have at it.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.323
- Thank you.
- All right.

01:33.561 --> 01:37.064
- All right, Leah Kamen,
42, lives in Edgewater.

01:37.064 --> 01:39.066
- She's a shift manager
at a telemarketing firm.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.734
- Insurance card.
I'll call the company,

01:40.734 --> 01:42.603
see if they got the name
of the doctor

01:42.603 --> 01:43.771
who submitted the claim.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.506
- Hey, is there any way
to trace the chemicals

01:45.506 --> 01:47.641
in their system back
to a specific manufacturer?

01:47.641 --> 01:50.344
- A mass spectrometry test
was performed on Jessica.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.612
We can order the same
for the others.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.181
There're only
a few manufacturers.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.682
- Will you do it, please?
- Yep.

01:54.682 --> 01:55.883
- Thanks.

01:55.883 --> 01:59.620
- Uh, Leah has Dani Frank,
Carol Shepperd,

01:59.620 --> 02:01.722
and Jessica Pope
as contacts on her phone.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.291
- All our victims
knew each other.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.592
- Yeah, looks like that.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.594
- Huh...
- Great. Thanks.

02:06.594 --> 02:09.263
I got a name.
Dr. Dean Reybold.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.609

- Hey...

02:21.609 --> 02:23.711
Al.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.213
What's going on?

02:25.213 --> 02:27.415
- [whispers]
Oh, man...

02:27.415 --> 02:29.283
- Hank. Hank.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.084
Hey, you can't go.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.221
- The hell I can't.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.623
- If you show up,
Reybold is gonna shut down.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.459
He doesn't know me.
I will take Jay.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.495
We will find out if he's
the one overdosing these women.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.499
Al...
- We'll look into the victim

02:45.499 --> 02:47.968
and then talk to Goodwin.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.238
Just you and me.
Right?

02:51.705 --> 02:55.709
- It's six years since I've
heard the name Dean Reybold.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.978
Six years since...

02:57.978 --> 03:00.881
- I know.

03:00.881 --> 03:04.852
- He was the last cancer doctor
Camille went to,

03:04.852 --> 03:06.254
and if he's the one
doing this--

03:06.254 --> 03:09.723
- If he's the one doing this,
we're gonna nail him.

waiting.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.674
Uh, my receptionist said
you were here about Leah.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.008
Brave woman.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.511
- That's right,
and Dani Frank, Jessica Pope,

03:30.511 --> 03:31.945
and Carol Shepperd as well.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.881
- Did something happen to them?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.983
- In the last 24 hours,
they've all shown up

03:35.983 --> 03:39.086
at Chicago Med
flooded with chemo.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.721
Dani's dead,

03:40.721 --> 03:42.456
and the other three
are in comas.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.527
- [sighs]

03:46.527 --> 03:49.530
[clears throat]

03:49.530 --> 03:50.831
Uh...

03:50.831 --> 03:54.302
They teach you...a lot about
the body in medical school,

03:54.302 --> 03:57.004
but what they don't
spend enough time on

03:57.004 --> 03:59.607
is teaching you
how to deal with loss.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.009
You get attached
to your patients.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.545
They're fighters,
and you fight with them,

04:04.545 --> 04:06.814
but with oncology,
you rarely win.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.317
- So, you treated
all of them?

04:09.317 --> 04:11.184
- I did--I am.

04:11.184 --> 04:14.021
- When was the last time
you met with these women?

04:14.021 --> 04:16.189
- I would have
to check their files.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.625
- Do you mind if we take
a look at those files?

04:18.625 --> 04:21.228
- Uh, I don't,
but the state does.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.697
I can't give 'em to you
unless you have a warrant,

04:23.697 --> 04:25.433
but the moment you do,
they're yours.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.000
I will hand them over
personally.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.336
- Why don't we drop the whole

04:28.336 --> 04:30.170
"I'm a fighter
for my patients" act,

04:30.170 --> 04:32.005
all right?

04:32.005 --> 04:34.074
We know you
mistreat your patients,

04:34.074 --> 04:36.544
and we know you did something
to these four women.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.346
- Yes, I helped them.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.713
- By poisoning them?

04:39.713 --> 04:41.915
- That's what chemotherapy is,
Detective.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.517
You poison cancer cells.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.519
If you don't understand
the most--

04:45.519 --> 04:47.988
- I understand
exactly what you did.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.557
- You know what, we're gonna be
back with a warrant.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.459
Thank you.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.694
- You know I'm happy to help
in any way I can.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.931
- Thanks for coming.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.800
- A little notice
would have been nice.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.902
- We're moving like
a bullet train on this one.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.937
- Well you pulled me out of
a jerk-off awards banquet,

05:03.937 --> 05:05.373
so I can't complain.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.508
Got a locker room
I could use to change?

05:07.508 --> 05:09.176
- Whatever you need,
Counselor.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.387
- Uh, Sarge, is there
anything more on the--

05:19.387 --> 05:22.155
- Burgess,
you remember Detective Stark

05:22.155 --> 05:24.958
from Area Central,
Violent Crimes, don't you?

05:24.958 --> 05:27.495
Lead detective
on Roman's shooting?

05:27.495 --> 05:29.730
- Right.
It's good to see you, Detective.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.399
I just wanted to say again

05:31.399 --> 05:33.401
how useful I can be
to your investigation--

05:33.401 --> 05:36.136
- Did something change
since I took your statement,

05:36.136 --> 05:38.271
or did you
actually see something?

05:38.271 --> 05:41.409
- Okay, the victim's ex-wife
said she saw a gun.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.143
I mean, there's evidence
of her being beaten with it.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.779
- The hospital report's
inconclusive,

05:45.779 --> 05:47.715
and Officer Roman underwent

05:47.715 --> 05:50.984
a painful medical procedure
to help this woman's child.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.821
So their relationship is...
suspect.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.255
- Okay, what is
your agenda here?

05:55.255 --> 05:56.657
Because
from where I'm standing,

05:56.657 --> 05:58.258
you look like you want
to do anything

05:58.258 --> 05:59.693
but help a jammed-up cop

05:59.693 --> 06:02.129
who wears the same badge as you,
Detective.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.831
- I have statements
from officers

06:03.831 --> 06:05.733
who canvassed neighbors,
yards, and alleys,

06:05.733 --> 06:07.835
and no gun has been found.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.538
Stay out of my investigation.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.976
- Hey.
- Thanks.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.446
- The guy's a prick.
What's the word?

06:18.446 --> 06:20.147
- I'm on ice
till they figure this out.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.582
I shouldn't even be
talking to you.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.316
- What can I do?
- You heard him.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.853
Nothing.
I'll see you later.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.156
- Burgess.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.724
Burgess.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.760
Burgess!
Get over here.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.596
- What?
- You're on your own today.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.031
- What?
- No partner. No assignment.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.333
I want you out there
patrolling wherever you want,

06:40.333 --> 06:42.603
and if that happens to be
in a neighborhood

06:42.603 --> 06:44.472
where a gun went missing,
well...

06:44.472 --> 06:47.007
I don't know
anything about that.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.042
- Thank you, Sergeant.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.282
- We'll need documents,
invoices.

06:55.282 --> 06:58.519
If the doctor ordered medicine
overseas, the source country.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.521
Every piece of evidence counts.

07:00.521 --> 07:04.091
I need proof that Reybold
acted with criminal intent.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.160
I need evidence he knew his
actions could result in harm,

07:07.160 --> 07:08.929
but he acted anyway.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.265
Until you have that...
no arrests.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.068
Is that clear?

07:15.068 --> 07:16.504
- Let's do it.

we're holding one here

07:56.409 --> 07:59.312
shredding documents.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.148
- It's just preemptive.
They're just looking for--

08:01.148 --> 08:02.616
- Sergeant.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.184
- Where's the warrant?

08:09.623 --> 08:11.559
So you came here
with a hastily written

08:11.559 --> 08:14.562

search warrant to what?

08:14.562 --> 08:16.296
Upset my clients' patients?

08:16.296 --> 08:18.298
- Your client has been
diagnosing patients

08:18.298 --> 08:20.133
with cancer they don't have
to fleece them

08:20.133 --> 08:21.802

they don't need.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.436
I'd say he's the one
upsetting them.

You hear me?

08:56.604 --> 08:57.971

08:57.971 --> 09:01.441
- She was such a fighter.

want you to do this.

10:44.511 --> 10:48.648
Ritchie took off on foot
after Roman shot him,

10:48.648 --> 10:51.719
but no car registered to him
was found here the next day.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.121
So I checked with Uber.
He doesn't have an account.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.555
No cabs came here,

10:55.555 --> 10:59.292
and his monthly el pass
doesn't have him on it all day.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.561
So...I'm wondering,

11:01.561 --> 11:04.131
did, maybe,
somebody drive him here?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.001
- Denny.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.402
- Ritchie's brother.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.605
- Ritchie had a couple DUIs
and had his license yanked.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.541
So, Denny,
he drove him around.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.243
- Okay, do you think
that Denny could have

11:16.243 --> 11:17.811
stayed when he came here?

11:17.811 --> 11:19.579
Waited for Ritchie to come out?

11:19.579 --> 11:21.081
- Maybe.

11:21.081 --> 11:24.752
Denny's--he's a good guy.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.587
- What's that
supposed to mean?

11:27.587 --> 11:31.624
- Just--just that...

11:31.624 --> 11:34.795
- Is there anything else
I should know, Callie?

11:34.795 --> 11:36.496
- No.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.072
[metal clanks]

11:50.577 --> 11:53.680
- You know, I don't know
if you remember,

11:53.680 --> 11:57.117
but when Camille used to see you
in your office--

11:57.117 --> 12:00.954
and this is...

12:00.954 --> 12:04.391
when she was at her lowest
from the pain of chemo--

12:06.259 --> 12:08.661
Well, you'd take her hand

12:08.661 --> 12:11.799
and tell her she should
just treasure every moment

12:11.799 --> 12:15.068
because life is so fragile.

[ominous music]

*

12:28.816 --> 12:32.152
You better start
enjoying every moment.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.199
- Two years ago,

12:46.199 --> 12:50.037
Dr. Reybold told me
I had bone cancer.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.504
He said it would be tough,

12:51.504 --> 12:54.842
but we'd get
through it together.

12:54.842 --> 12:57.310
The kind of chemo
he gave me,

12:57.310 --> 12:59.512
it rots your bones.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.849
- I couldn't stay at my job.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.151
I can't play
with my children,

13:04.151 --> 13:07.154
be with my husband.

13:07.154 --> 13:11.691
Dr. Reybold kept reassuring
that this chemo was gonna work.

13:11.691 --> 13:16.129
- I was alive.
It was a miracle.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.065
- A year ago,

13:18.065 --> 13:20.500
my teeth started falling out.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.471
Six months ago,
it took my leg.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.508
- And now you're telling me
it was all for money?

13:28.508 --> 13:31.578
[somber music]

13:31.578 --> 13:39.652
*

13:50.697 --> 13:52.532
- What have you got?
- I made you copies

13:52.532 --> 13:54.501
of the patient files
we could salvage.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.803
42 out of 57 patients.
All women.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.972
All poisoned
with chemo they did not need.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.041
All willing to testify.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.043
Is this enough?
- For fraud?

14:03.043 --> 14:05.078
- For homicide.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.584
- You want him
to stop practicing today?

14:11.584 --> 14:14.587
I go in front of a special
grand jury with fraud charges,

14:14.587 --> 14:16.656
and the Department
of Professional Regulations

14:16.656 --> 14:18.758
will pull his license
the minute I do.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.028
And when his lawyer
sees what we have,

14:21.028 --> 14:22.829
he'll roll.

14:22.829 --> 14:25.165
Look, you turn up
new information after that,

14:25.165 --> 14:26.934
we can go back
for another bite at the apple

14:26.934 --> 14:29.937
and use the fraud case
as evidence.

14:29.937 --> 14:33.140
Erin...
he stops practicing

14:33.140 --> 14:36.009
the minute I walk in.

14:38.111 --> 14:42.549
How's your sergeant?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.585
- He'll be a lot better
with a homicide conviction.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.287
[door opens]

15:09.709 --> 15:11.979
What?

15:11.979 --> 15:14.982
[indistinct chatter]

15:16.216 --> 15:18.851
- Hey.
You made a deal?

15:18.851 --> 15:20.887
What kind of deal?

15:20.887 --> 15:23.090
- It's a year's
license suspension--

15:23.090 --> 15:24.992
- Are you kidding me?
- Five years probation,

15:24.992 --> 15:27.027
$14 million in resti--
- No jail time?

15:27.027 --> 15:28.761
- You think these women want
to get dragged through a trial?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.530
- I think those women
want justice.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.698
I do!

15:31.698 --> 15:34.201
- If he loses,
he could appeal for years.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.237
How many of them
have that kind of time?

15:37.237 --> 15:39.506
- He didn't just
defraud people, Dana.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.309
He murdered them.
- But we can't prove it.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.845
The judge advised us to take
this based on the evidence.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.180
State's attorney agreed.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.150
Until you get me new evidence...

15:50.150 --> 15:52.285
my hands are tied.

[dramatic music]

15:58.725 --> 16:04.331
*

16:04.331 --> 16:06.033
- Hey.

16:16.076 --> 16:16.209
.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.311
- Well, at first blush,

16:19.379 --> 16:20.480
clinically,
classic psychopath.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.515
Prey on the weak.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.452
All these women are marginalized
by age or race

16:25.452 --> 16:28.488
and physically or emotionally
removed from any support.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.956
- Well, we know
from phone records

16:29.956 --> 16:31.658
four of these women
knew each other,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.226
and from there,

16:33.226 --> 16:35.162
we discovered
they met in a chat room,

16:35.162 --> 16:37.430
compared notes.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.500
They agreed to meet with him,
and as best we can tell,

16:40.500 --> 16:43.570
confront him about his methods.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.839
So my question is:

16:46.839 --> 16:48.075
how could he have managed
to pull them in for more rounds

16:48.075 --> 16:50.977
if they were already
skeptical?

16:50.977 --> 16:53.480
- Cancer diagnosis
has so much uncertainty.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.415
People are looking for a guide

16:55.415 --> 16:57.084
through the process,

16:57.084 --> 16:58.318
someone they can trust.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.187
- A savior.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.954
- Hmm.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.990
And if they walked away,
what would they have?

17:03.990 --> 17:05.992
Psychopaths
control their victims

17:05.992 --> 17:08.161
to get that charge
they crave.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.929
Telling a healthy woman
she has cancer,

17:09.929 --> 17:11.198
oh, there's a thrill.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.665
Probably where he started.
Right?

17:13.665 --> 17:15.667
He does that,
doesn't get caught,

17:15.667 --> 17:17.737
so he escalates
to the next stimulus--

17:17.737 --> 17:20.006
treating her,
becoming her champion.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.474
I wager heavily
we look into this guy's past,

17:22.474 --> 17:25.112
there's mistreatment by women.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.380
Now he flipped it.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.549
"I used to be subject.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.219
Now I'm God."

17:32.219 --> 17:34.387
- Would you be willing
to testify to that?

17:34.387 --> 17:36.256
- [scoffs]

17:39.892 --> 17:43.130
In order to take the stand,
you know, I gotta...

17:43.130 --> 17:44.831
I get fully formed diagnosis,
right?

17:44.831 --> 17:47.767
Speak to him directly.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.469
- Well...

17:49.469 --> 17:52.139
he ain't pleading insanity...

17:52.139 --> 17:53.740
and I promise you

17:53.740 --> 17:57.377
his lawyer's not gonna
let you anywhere near him.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.045
[knock on door]
[door opens]

17:59.045 --> 18:01.181
- Dr. Charles--sorry.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.217
I just wanted to let you know
that Jessica Pope...

18:04.217 --> 18:05.752
she didn't make it.

18:06.886 --> 18:10.490
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.233
- The thing about psychopaths...

18:22.569 --> 18:25.605
Love to hear themselves talk.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.415
- Yeah?
- We picked up footage

18:35.415 --> 18:37.717
of your car outside Callie's
house the night of the incident.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.519
- You mean the night
your partner killed my brother.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.354
- Yeah, and I know
you drove him there.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.190
- So?
- So I don't think you left.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.857
I think you followed him,
and when he bled out

18:44.857 --> 18:46.226
you took his gun
so he'd look innocent.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.595
And because of that, a good
police officer is gonna go down

18:48.595 --> 18:50.930
for something he didn't do.
- You guys are incredible.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.098
- If you have that gun, Denny,

18:52.098 --> 18:53.500
you need to turn it over
right now.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.435
Otherwise, you're looking at--
- Are you arresting me?

18:56.569 --> 18:57.670
- Mm-mm, not yet.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.006
- I don't have a gun.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.774
I got nothing more
to say to you.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.380
- Thank you.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.054
- Whoa.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.523
You're that doctor
from the news.

19:16.523 --> 19:17.657
I'm sorry.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.793
Dr. Daniel Charles,
Chicago Med.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.930
Man, they sure are going after
us these days, aren't they?

19:23.930 --> 19:25.232
You out on bail?

19:25.232 --> 19:28.134
I mean, why are they even
charging you in the first place?

19:28.134 --> 19:30.237
Can you explain that to me?

19:32.839 --> 19:36.643
Must be so hard to distance
yourself from cancer patients.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.311
- When you got into
medicine,

19:38.311 --> 19:40.713
did you expect
to save everyone's life?

19:40.713 --> 19:42.582
- Hmm...

19:42.582 --> 19:44.884
but to lose patients
over and over,

19:44.884 --> 19:47.620
watch them get diminished
by illness...

19:47.620 --> 19:50.457
- The U.S. is so far behind.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.960
I have a series of cocktails
that are revolutionary.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.497
Other doctors don't approach
my methods or my numbers.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.165
That's what should be
on the news.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.634
- That should be on the news...
[both chuckle]

20:01.634 --> 20:03.135
And, of course, I mean,

20:03.135 --> 20:04.971
they never questioned
your therapies, right?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.539
I mean, wh--
- [chuckles]

20:06.539 --> 20:08.941
Did they have a medical degree?
- Exactly.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.478
- Did they cure cancer?
[laughs]

20:11.478 --> 20:13.946
That shuts 'em up.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.115
You know, bottom line,

20:16.115 --> 20:17.784
they're afraid
for their lives,

20:17.784 --> 20:19.786
and they come to understand

20:19.786 --> 20:22.489
I'm the only one
who can save them.

20:26.158 --> 20:29.228
- What a lovely watch.
- It's beautiful, right?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.563
Yeah, I got a guy,

20:30.563 --> 20:33.800
uh, Howard, on South Wabash.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.168
This retails 75,000 easy.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.704
He gave it to me for 45,000.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.706
- Whew.
- [chuckles]

20:39.706 --> 20:42.241
If you're interested I can,
uh, give you his info.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.377
He can hook you up.
I mean, look at this thing.

20:44.377 --> 20:47.914
- Wow, gorgeous.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.783
Really gorgeous.
- Yeah.

- Hey.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.927
- What do you know
about the brother?

21:00.927 --> 21:03.463
- Whose? Ritchie's?
- Yeah.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.332
- I didn't deal with him.
- I did some digging.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.834
He has two parking tickets
written on Callie's block.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.201
- Yeah, he'd drive Ritchie.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.371
- When Ritchie was in jail.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.739
Did Denny and Callie
have a thing?

21:12.739 --> 21:13.906
- How would I know?

21:13.906 --> 21:15.241
- There's something
going on there.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.876
She seemed
very protective of him.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.145
So I'm just trying
to figure out who to go at next.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.348
- So Denny took the gun.
- Yeah.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.082
- If he did, he'd have
thrown it in the river.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.918
Here we are.
Same place we started.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.688
- [scoffs]
That's defeatist.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.591
- No, that's realist.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.626
This is defeatist.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.458
- Hmm.

22:09.396 --> 22:12.131
- I mean, my whole life
till I was 14 was Bunny.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.033
You know?

22:14.033 --> 22:16.903
When she was sober.
When she wasn't.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.207
I didn't know

22:21.207 --> 22:24.076
that moms could be kind.

22:24.076 --> 22:28.415
Or brave.
Or Unselfish.

22:29.649 --> 22:32.985
She didn't even like me
when you first brought me home.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.722
You remember that?
- Yeah.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.290
- She already had her hands
full with Justin,

22:38.290 --> 22:42.895
and I showed up and I just
doubled her trouble.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.932

We were hellions.

22:49.469 --> 22:52.739
I remember this one day
I came home...

22:52.739 --> 22:55.207
Iron Maiden T-shirt,
skirt up to here, you know,

22:55.207 --> 22:58.845
and she's just waiting for me
in the living room.

22:58.845 --> 23:02.482
She has a dress
from Marshall Field's.

23:05.452 --> 23:08.755
She told me that...

23:08.755 --> 23:11.958
you saw something in me
that was worth sacrificing for,

23:11.958 --> 23:16.028
and so she would too,

23:16.028 --> 23:20.166
and she used her Christmas money
to buy me that dress.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.971
- I have an idea.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.338
Reybold met with our victims

23:26.338 --> 23:28.741
three weeks before they
showed up dead or in comas.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.477
You have the accounts receivable
for his office?

23:30.477 --> 23:33.379
- Here and here.

23:33.379 --> 23:36.883
- The victims met with Reybold
on December 10th,

23:36.883 --> 23:39.318
and--there.

23:39.318 --> 23:41.788
December 11th...

23:41.788 --> 23:44.991
an order came into the office
for chemo for each victim.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.026
- How much?
- Twice as much as they got

23:47.026 --> 23:48.861
every other time before.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.096
- On the 11th?

23:50.096 --> 23:52.665
Wait,
'cause in Reybold's schedule,

23:52.665 --> 23:54.634
he has our victims
getting treated

23:54.634 --> 23:57.369
on December 14th,

23:57.369 --> 23:59.305
the 16th,

23:59.305 --> 24:01.073
and the 17th.

24:01.073 --> 24:05.044
And then he had
another order for chemo placed

24:05.044 --> 24:07.213
December 22nd

24:07.213 --> 24:10.149
for three times
the usual amount.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.318
And he's got them all listed
for appointments

24:12.318 --> 24:14.320
right after that.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.022
- Wait, what was the last order?

24:18.791 --> 24:20.693
- January 2nd.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.730
That's right before
they came into Med,

24:23.730 --> 24:26.766
and it's seven times
the usual amount.

24:28.367 --> 24:32.539
- How did he get that past
the insurance companies?

24:32.539 --> 24:35.575
They'd never approve seven times
the normal amount of chemo.

24:35.575 --> 24:38.110
- Did he even bill it
to insurance?

24:40.747 --> 24:42.414
- No.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.350
So his office
ate the payments?

24:44.350 --> 24:47.019
- Or he paid for it himself.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.455
If you're gonna order
enough chemo to kill someone,

24:49.455 --> 24:51.858
that would be murder.
- Is this enough?

24:53.425 --> 24:55.695
- His signature on the invoices

24:55.695 --> 24:57.363
proves intent
with physical evidence.

24:57.363 --> 24:59.899
Keeping it off the books
is a cover-up.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.334
If I can get the women
from the fraud case to testify

25:02.334 --> 25:06.072
he dosed them personally...

25:06.072 --> 25:08.207
I think we can convince a jury.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.209
- That's all I need to know.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.878
[applause]
- Thank you...thank you.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.714
You know, I've devoted
my whole life to healing,

25:14.714 --> 25:17.750
but healing is more than
finding the right medication,

25:17.750 --> 25:20.953
more than establishing
the right treatment program.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.889
[applause]
No, it's connecting

25:22.889 --> 25:24.624
with our patients wholly
and never giving up,

25:24.624 --> 25:28.360
making them believe that
a full recovery is possible too.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.830
- Yeah, is that how it went
with Jessica Pope?

25:30.830 --> 25:33.199
What about Dani Frank?
Carol Shepperd?

25:33.199 --> 25:34.433
- Back off.
- Leah Kamen?

25:34.433 --> 25:36.335
What about their healing?

25:36.335 --> 25:38.671
I guess they had a different
treatment program, huh, Doc?

25:38.671 --> 25:40.873
- Uh, this--this isn't--
- Turn around.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.441
You're under arrest
for the murder

25:42.441 --> 25:45.645
and attempted murder
of four patients.

25:45.645 --> 25:48.014
That's not too tight, is it?

25:48.014 --> 25:49.348
Come on.

25:49.348 --> 25:50.617
[crowd murmuring]

25:56.623 --> 25:56.723
.

25:57.624 --> 25:58.057
- These 42 patients

25:59.291 --> 26:00.426
already had their day
in court, Your Honor.

26:00.426 --> 26:03.062
Dr. Reybold took a plea
and was sentenced.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.231
Case closed.
- Except it's a straight line

26:05.231 --> 26:07.734
from the fraud to these murders,
and drawing that line--

26:07.734 --> 26:10.536
- Will unnecessarily
prejudice the jury.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.872
What happened to the patients
in that case

26:12.872 --> 26:14.440
is irrelevant
in the current proceeding.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.308
- Irrelevant?
Because the fraud victims

26:16.308 --> 26:18.144
didn't die and my victims did?

26:18.144 --> 26:20.112
- Your Honor--
- Pull it back, Ms. Shelby.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.282
- Dr. Reybold murdered four
women to cover up his fraud.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.217
The jury needs to hear this

26:25.217 --> 26:27.119
so that they can understand
the whole story.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.488
- But they'll be
unduly prejudiced if they do.

26:29.488 --> 26:30.790
The bottom line is:

26:30.790 --> 26:33.292
the fraud victims
can't testify.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.903
- Too prejudicial?
Not relevant?

26:43.903 --> 26:45.304
- It was an uphill battle.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.774
- So not one of the victims
can testify

26:47.774 --> 26:50.342
that Reybold dosed
our four women personally?

26:50.342 --> 26:52.111
- Three...the Medical Examiner

26:52.111 --> 26:55.514
just ruled Jessica Pope's death
a suicide.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.216
- Put me on the stand.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.685
- Why?
Do you have cancer?

26:58.685 --> 27:00.586
- I can walk a jury
through all of this.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.121
- Sure, then Green
will rip you a new one

27:02.121 --> 27:03.355
when she brings up Camille

27:03.355 --> 27:04.824
and your motive
for going after him.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.526
- I'm the lead investigator
on this case.

27:07.526 --> 27:10.296
If you don't put me
on the stand, she will,

27:10.296 --> 27:12.464
and you won't have
set the table for it.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.866
Dana.

27:13.866 --> 27:16.202
- If you go off script
one time,

27:16.202 --> 27:17.737
you will lose this case
for us.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.138
It is too big a risk.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.107
I'm putting Erin on
to talk about the investigation.

27:21.107 --> 27:24.143
There is no way
you are testifying.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.484
- If Denny's anything
like his brother,

27:32.484 --> 27:34.987
he would have thrown that gun
into the river like Roman said.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.723
- Denny's not like Ritchie
though.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.324
He's had the same job
for ten years.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.426
I mean, those parking tickets
by Callie's house--

27:40.426 --> 27:42.561
only brush with the law
he's ever had.

27:42.561 --> 27:46.265
I bet my life he took that gun
to protect Ritchie--and Callie.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.967
- So go talk to him.
- I can't.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.036
I have been
in this guy's face before.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.571
He won't roll for just me.
I mean, I-I need...

27:52.571 --> 27:53.973
something
to hold over him or--

27:53.973 --> 27:55.474
- I know what you need.

27:55.474 --> 27:56.976
- Wait, what?
- Me.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.445
Bobby, watch the desk.
I'm doing some field work.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.781
- Okay.
- Are you coming or what?

28:01.781 --> 28:02.882
- Yeah.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.656
- Hey.

28:10.656 --> 28:12.925
'Sup, Denny?

28:12.925 --> 28:14.761
- This is harassment.

28:14.761 --> 28:17.764
- I'm gonna paint you
a picture here, Denny.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.598
You lie to an officer,

28:19.598 --> 28:21.768
that's impeding
an investigation.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.870
You make a false statement
on the record,

28:23.870 --> 28:25.537
that's obstruction of
justice.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.973
You keep a gun,

28:26.973 --> 28:28.775
that's withholding evidence
in a murder.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.409
- You brought your mom?

28:30.409 --> 28:32.511
What, 'cause you couldn't prove
I did any of that on your own?

28:32.511 --> 28:34.446
- We have proof that you
drove your inebriated brother

28:34.446 --> 28:36.883
to a residence where he
committed aggravated battery,

28:36.883 --> 28:38.617
and then he threatened
a police officer,

28:38.617 --> 28:40.219
which led to his death.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.221
You know what you can
be charged with?

28:42.221 --> 28:43.589
Accessory to murder.

28:43.589 --> 28:44.891
- Whatever.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.292
You're just saying things
to try and trap me.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.794
- No, you will be charged

28:47.794 --> 28:49.962
as an accessory
in your own brother's death.

28:49.962 --> 28:52.198
Felony murder.
That's two to five years.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.666
And not in county.
Stateville.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.002
Come on, the way I see it,

28:56.002 --> 28:57.469
you've been trying to help
everybody else.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.305
Your brother.
Callie.

28:59.305 --> 29:02.541
If I were you, I'd start
thinking about helping myself.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.410
- Where's the gun, Denny?

29:07.313 --> 29:10.482
- That gun turns up, the city
does nothing for Callie.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.218
She quit her job
to take care of Andrew.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.453
Ritchie left her flat broke.

29:14.453 --> 29:17.456
She deserves better.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.858
- There's a reward

29:18.858 --> 29:21.593
for information leading
to the whereabouts of the gun.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.595
That reward could...

29:23.595 --> 29:26.698
take the turn of a check
made out to anonymous.

29:26.698 --> 29:29.701
If you tell the detective
in charge everything you saw--

29:29.701 --> 29:31.971
all of it--
and that gun turns back up,

29:31.971 --> 29:35.607
well, that check could end up
in the hands of a nice woman.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.210
25,000 dollars' worth.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.046
- And I wouldn't be charged
with anything?

29:40.046 --> 29:42.181
- You're the grieving brother.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.716
Why would we charge you
with anything?

29:49.989 --> 29:52.458
- In your review
of Dr. Reybold's books,

29:52.458 --> 29:55.261
you found no evidence he
billed any insurance companies

29:55.261 --> 29:57.864
for these treatments.
- No.

29:57.864 --> 30:01.400
- Well, who did pay
for these treatments?

30:01.400 --> 30:04.036
- Dr. Reybold himself.
From his personal account.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.204
- Personal.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.638
Which allowed him
to overdose patients--

30:06.638 --> 30:09.308
- Objection.
- Overruled.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.444
- To overdose patients
without raising a red flag

30:12.444 --> 30:15.347
with the insurance companies.
- Yes.

30:15.347 --> 30:18.284
- No further questions.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.853
- Could Dr. Reybold
have been helping patients

30:20.853 --> 30:22.621
get the care they needed?

30:22.621 --> 30:24.957
For instance,
if three patients came to him

30:24.957 --> 30:27.526
and said they were having
financial difficulties

30:27.526 --> 30:29.962
but wanted to stay alive...

30:29.962 --> 30:33.565
what kind of doctor might pay
for those treatments himself?

30:33.565 --> 30:37.003
- A really remarkable one.
That's for sure.

30:39.771 --> 30:42.808
- Thank you.
That's all.

30:42.808 --> 30:44.776
- My conversation
with Dr. Reybold

30:44.776 --> 30:46.578
coupled with
a look at his history

30:46.578 --> 30:50.582
led me to a clear diagnosis
of psychopathy.

30:50.582 --> 30:56.188
The psychopathic mind
lacks fear, remorse, empathy.

30:56.188 --> 31:00.960
In essence, it can't connect to
or care about others.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.929
That's Dr. Reybold.

31:02.929 --> 31:04.530
- But he's a doctor.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.066
Doesn't that suggest
empathy or caring?

31:07.066 --> 31:09.969
- Well, you'd be shocked
how many functional psychopaths

31:09.969 --> 31:11.303
are in the world,

31:11.303 --> 31:13.539
you know, attracted to power,
control.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.574
Flaunting
his success rates,

31:15.574 --> 31:18.810
the therapies only
he can administer,

31:18.810 --> 31:22.781
belittling his patients
to keep them under his control.

31:22.781 --> 31:25.617
"I'm the one
with the medical degree,"

31:25.617 --> 31:27.653
he would say to his patients.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.421
- You know this how?

31:29.421 --> 31:30.622
- Because he told me.

31:30.622 --> 31:33.492
- I renew my objection.
This entire conversation--

31:33.492 --> 31:37.163
- Was a spontaneous admission
that has already been ruled on.

31:37.163 --> 31:38.965
- Agreed.
Overruled.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.099
Continue, Ms. Shelby.

31:40.099 --> 31:43.169
- So Dr. Reybold
would ask his patients

31:43.169 --> 31:44.971
if they had a medical degree?

31:44.971 --> 31:47.739
- And made sure they knew

31:47.739 --> 31:50.609
he was the only one
who could save them.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.445
Those are actual words
from our conversation.

31:53.445 --> 31:56.315
- Thank you, Dr. Charles.

31:58.050 --> 32:01.653
- Well, let's talk
about that conversation.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.223
Was it at your office?
- No.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.392
- At the court?
Ordered by a judge?

32:06.392 --> 32:08.227
- Nope.
- Did Dr. Reybold know

32:08.227 --> 32:09.996
he was being interviewed?

32:09.996 --> 32:12.164
- As I said before,
it was not an interview.

32:12.164 --> 32:15.134
It was two doctors striking up
a conversation.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.269
- Where did this conversation
take place?

32:17.269 --> 32:20.306
- In a coffee shop.
- Near your house?

32:20.306 --> 32:22.341
- No.
- Your office?

32:22.341 --> 32:24.243
- No.
- In fact,

32:24.243 --> 32:28.014
it was 8 miles
from either of those places.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.816
- Didn't measure.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.384
- Do you know
how many coffee shops

32:32.384 --> 32:35.054
are between your house
or office and there?

32:35.054 --> 32:36.722
- I don't.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.357
- 37.

32:38.357 --> 32:41.327
37 other coffee shops,

32:41.327 --> 32:44.030
and you rolled
into this particular one,

32:44.030 --> 32:46.598
two blocks
from the defendant's house?

32:46.598 --> 32:49.301
To stalk him?
- Objection.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.602
- Sustained.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.704
- Were you paid
by the prosecution

32:52.704 --> 32:54.373
for your services,
Dr. Charles?

32:54.373 --> 32:55.441
- I was not.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.044
- You're an unpaid agent
of the police.

32:58.044 --> 33:01.247
- No one told me
to speak with Dr. Reybold.

33:01.247 --> 33:05.051
I walked into that coffee shop

33:05.051 --> 33:07.519
and I saw this...

33:07.519 --> 33:09.388
doctor...

33:10.622 --> 33:12.658
And my curiosity
got the best of me.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.860
- That works out well for State,
doesn't it?

33:14.860 --> 33:16.262
Withdrawn.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.598
Ever socialize with members

33:19.598 --> 33:22.101
of the Intelligence Unit,
Dr. Charles?

33:22.101 --> 33:24.303
Perhaps at a bar called Molly's?

33:24.303 --> 33:27.073
- I have.
- So they're friends of yours?

33:27.073 --> 33:29.775
- My report on Dr. Reybold
is an unbiased analy--

33:29.775 --> 33:31.710
- That wasn't the question.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.945
- I know them through work

33:33.945 --> 33:37.216
and would be very proud
to call them my friends.

33:37.216 --> 33:38.817
- No further questions.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.787
[dramatic music]

33:41.787 --> 33:46.092
*

33:46.092 --> 33:48.894
- Look, get a continuance.
My team and I--

33:48.894 --> 33:52.098
- I already used up my goodwill
with this judge.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.865
- Then put Antonio
on the stand.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.567
He'll testify to the paper trail
of the money.

33:55.567 --> 33:56.868
- The damage has been done.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.371
They'll make those payments
look like something else.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.507
Again.

34:01.507 --> 34:04.876
- So tell me
what you need to win.

34:06.011 --> 34:09.981
- I need the patients
from the fraud case back in.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.484
I need 42 people
on a witness stand

34:12.484 --> 34:14.018
to say he dosed them
personally

34:14.018 --> 34:15.654
or any eyewitness

34:15.654 --> 34:18.389
that can put that needle
in Reybold's hand.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.426
Can you do that?

34:20.426 --> 34:22.128
- Maybe.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.697
If you put me on the stand.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.003
All three victims were
in contact with each other,

34:32.003 --> 34:33.205
comparing notes.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.206
We know this from
their phone records.

34:35.206 --> 34:38.677
After their December 10th
meeting with Dr. Reybold,

34:38.677 --> 34:40.779
they agreed
to an experimental treatment

34:40.779 --> 34:42.547
which, in actuality,

34:42.547 --> 34:46.485
was simply
twice the usual dose of chemo.

34:46.485 --> 34:49.987
The following week, he upped it
to three times the amount.

34:49.987 --> 34:52.056
By the time they wound up
in the hospital,

34:52.056 --> 34:53.391
it was at seven times.

34:53.391 --> 34:56.161
- Because they confronted him
about what he did,

34:56.161 --> 34:57.796
and he was afraid
of being exposed.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.199
- Objection.
Counsel is testifying.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.601
- Sustained.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.370
- In your investigation,

35:04.370 --> 35:05.737
did you find it suspicious

35:05.737 --> 35:08.374
three patients met with
the doctor one day--

35:08.374 --> 35:09.441
- Objection.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.577
No one knows what transpired
in this meeting.

35:11.577 --> 35:15.181
- That's because everyone in
that meeting besides Dr. Reybold

35:15.181 --> 35:16.648
is dead or in a coma.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.384
- You Honor.
- One more time,

35:18.384 --> 35:21.019
and you're in contempt.

35:21.019 --> 35:23.455
- [sighs]

35:23.455 --> 35:26.858
Could the amounts the patients
received have been lab mistakes?

35:26.858 --> 35:29.795
- No, Dr. Reybold's signature
was on every order.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.730
- Well, what about
a dosing error?

35:31.730 --> 35:33.465
- His staffer testified

35:33.465 --> 35:36.402
that Dr. Reybold personally
administered those doses.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.036
- But the staffer cut a deal.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.271
- That doesn't mean
it wasn't the truth.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.473
- Objection.
Improper opinion.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.808
- Sustained.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.876
- What about any
other witnesses who--

35:44.876 --> 35:46.312
- Asked and answered.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.580
- Yes, Ms. Shelby,
move on.

35:48.580 --> 35:52.384
- Your Honor, someone has to
speak for these victims.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.753
- You don't speak.
You ask questions.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.488
And if nobody else
saw the doctor dosing--

35:56.488 --> 35:59.691
- Someone else did.

35:59.691 --> 36:02.361
Me.

36:02.361 --> 36:05.631
I saw Dr. Reybold
dose a patient.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.766
My wife.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.369
I saw Dr. Reybold
dose my wife Camille

36:10.369 --> 36:14.005
who died of cancer
under Dr. Reybold's care

36:22.281 --> 36:22.414
.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.049
- Sergeant Voight--
- I'm a witness.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.953
I saw him dose a patient.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.823
- The State has
no further questions

36:31.823 --> 36:33.559
for this witness.

36:35.261 --> 36:37.563
- Well, I have a few.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.702
Losing your wife to cancer

36:43.702 --> 36:46.405
must have been very painful,
Sergeant.

36:49.641 --> 36:53.011
Can you talk
about your wife's illness?

36:58.850 --> 37:02.053
- Camille was referred
to Dr. Reybold

37:02.053 --> 37:05.291
when her ovarian cancer
returned.

37:05.291 --> 37:11.297
He recommended
an aggressive course

37:11.297 --> 37:14.933
and then a second round
when that didn't get it all.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.636
She was cold all the time...

37:19.638 --> 37:22.974
Couldn't keep food down.

37:22.974 --> 37:26.878
Memory went in and out.
She...

37:26.878 --> 37:29.581
She was depressed.

37:32.751 --> 37:36.121
She fought as hard
as she could, but...

37:37.122 --> 37:39.157
- She sounds brave.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.062
- She was.

37:44.062 --> 37:45.731
- [sighs]

37:45.731 --> 37:47.599
You're still in mourning

37:47.599 --> 37:50.636
over your wife's death.

37:50.636 --> 37:53.204
Isn't that what this is
about?

37:53.204 --> 37:54.773
- No.

37:56.342 --> 37:58.444
- How gratifying would it be

37:58.444 --> 38:01.880
to help convict Dr. Reybold?

38:01.880 --> 38:03.915
- It would be very gratifying.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.917
- No further questions.
- For all his victims.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.453
- I said no further questions.

38:07.453 --> 38:10.489
You answered exactly
as I expected you to.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.892
- Redirect?

38:15.427 --> 38:18.063
What other victims

38:18.063 --> 38:20.231
are you referring to,
Sergeant Voight?

38:20.231 --> 38:21.433
- Objection.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.502
- Ms. Green
questioned my witness

38:23.502 --> 38:27.839
about one prior patient,
Camille Voight.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.207
Now she opened the door

38:29.207 --> 38:32.978
to the other 42 patients
he treated.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.447
- She's right.
Overruled.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.284
- What other victims?

38:39.284 --> 38:42.388
- Helen Graham...

38:42.388 --> 38:44.723
Nia Felten...

38:44.723 --> 38:47.493
Priya Parvati...

38:47.493 --> 38:49.928
Anne Gamerman...

38:49.928 --> 38:52.398
and 38 other people

38:52.398 --> 38:56.101
this doctor diagnosed
with cancer they didn't have

38:56.101 --> 38:58.404
and treated with chemo
they didn't need.

38:58.404 --> 38:59.738
- And how do you know this
to be true?

38:59.738 --> 39:03.241
- Because he said so himself
in court under oath.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.176
- Objection.
- Overruled.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.712
Continue.

39:08.414 --> 39:11.149
- Dr. Reybold confessed

39:11.149 --> 39:15.153
to personally poisoning
42 patients,

39:15.153 --> 39:18.056
ruining their lives,

39:18.056 --> 39:20.426
terrifying them
and their families,

39:20.426 --> 39:22.428
and he did it all for a payout,

39:22.428 --> 39:24.630
and he admitted to all of this

39:24.630 --> 39:26.164
as part of a deal he made

39:26.164 --> 39:29.735
with the State of Illinois,
copping to fraud.

39:32.838 --> 39:36.475
- This deal, Sergeant Voight?

39:36.475 --> 39:37.943
- That's the one.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.545
- The State would like
to enter into evidence

39:39.545 --> 39:42.548
case number 111 496

39:42.548 --> 39:46.852
and amend its witness list
by 42 people.

39:46.852 --> 39:50.021
[dramatic music]

39:50.021 --> 39:59.631
*

40:02.634 --> 40:04.936
- They have a verdict.

40:04.936 --> 40:09.274
- Hour of deliberation.
That's...

40:09.274 --> 40:11.142
that's probably good, right?

40:12.978 --> 40:15.280
- Camille would be proud
of you.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.286
- You too, kiddo.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.557
- On the count
of Narcotic Induced Homicide

40:25.557 --> 40:27.158
of Danielle Frank...

40:27.158 --> 40:29.861
- We find the defendant
guilty.

40:29.861 --> 40:32.464
- On the count of Narcotic
Induced Attempted Homicide

40:32.464 --> 40:33.832
of Carol Shepperd...

40:33.832 --> 40:35.834
- We find the defendant guilty.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.570
- On the count of Narcotic
Induced Attempted Homicide

40:38.570 --> 40:39.838
of Leah Kamen...

40:39.838 --> 40:42.340
- We find the defendant guilty.

40:42.340 --> 40:44.743
- Defendant is remanded
into custody until such time

40:44.743 --> 40:46.878
as a sentencing hearing
is scheduled.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.047
Bailiff.

40:49.047 --> 40:52.751
- Hank, your wife
did not suffer needlessly.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.986
You have to believe me.
The cancer did come back.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.387
I never harmed Camille.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.490
These patients,
I was their only hope.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.125
They got years because of me.

41:00.125 --> 41:03.261
You can't put someone away
for saving lives.

41:03.261 --> 41:05.130
You can't!

41:05.130 --> 41:07.398
I wasn't harming them.
I was helping them.

41:07.398 --> 41:09.434
Helping!

41:14.372 --> 41:16.374
- Look, you're swimming!
You're swimming!

41:16.374 --> 41:17.809
That was so good.
Did you see that?

41:17.809 --> 41:19.611
- [laughs]
Yeah.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.547
- I'm swimming!
- You sure are.

41:21.547 --> 41:22.814
- Whoo!

41:22.814 --> 41:24.215
He's gonna get you.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.784
- How did that feel?
- Swimming!

41:25.784 --> 41:28.319
- You sure were.
He was holding on to my suit.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.557
That's awesome.

41:31.557 --> 41:33.058
- S!
- [murmurs]

41:33.058 --> 41:34.660
T!

41:34.660 --> 41:36.461
What's the T say?

41:36.461 --> 41:38.063
Tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh.

41:38.063 --> 41:39.565
Good.
What's this letter?

41:39.565 --> 41:40.932
- U.
- U.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.301
You want Dad to open a present?
Let Dad open a present.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.403
Give it to Dad.
Give it to Dad.

41:45.403 --> 41:49.374
This is for Dad.
- Here, Mommy, you can film.

41:49.374 --> 41:51.577
Okay, you gonna help me?

41:51.577 --> 41:53.111
- Yeah, I can help you.
- Help me.

41:58.584 --> 41:59.985
- Hi, honey.
- There's Mama.

41:59.985 --> 42:02.621
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

42:02.621 --> 42:05.456
- I love you.
- I love you.
