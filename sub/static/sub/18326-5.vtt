WEBVTT

00:49.841 --> 00:53.136
[narrator] In London's diamond center,
traders are about to sleep more easily.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.766
With the construction of this ultramodern
and impregnable vault,

00:57.849 --> 00:59.768
the boot's finally on the other foot.

01:00.351 --> 01:03.063
It's the jewel thieves
who will be crying into their beer

01:03.146 --> 01:05.690
when the Hatton Garden
Security Deposit Company

01:06.232 --> 01:07.609
opens for business next month.

01:17.577 --> 01:21.081
[Grant] For over half a century,
the Hatton Garden security vault

01:21.164 --> 01:22.290
has remained a fortress.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.043
Until now.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.755
On an April night in 2015...

01:29.339 --> 01:32.467
a gang of thieves
attempt the unthinkable:

01:33.718 --> 01:35.804
Break into the unbreakable...

01:36.054 --> 01:38.973
and pull off the crime of the century.

01:40.391 --> 01:43.728
The police are astonished
that Hatton Garden has been breached.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.401
What gang could possibly have carried out
such an audacious heist?

01:57.367 --> 01:58.743
Criminal masterminds. I love this.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.247
They were calling this
the biggest British heist of all time.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.624
Which is the rabbit hole
we're about to go down.

02:04.707 --> 02:05.750
Heists.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.628
[Grant] In this White Rabbit Project,
we're investigating

02:08.711 --> 02:11.089
some of the craziest criminal capers
of all time.

02:11.756 --> 02:15.093
Not giving up.
There's $20 million right here.

02:16.177 --> 02:18.179
From one of crime's high flyers...

02:18.263 --> 02:20.098
Tell the pilot the plane's been hijacked.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.936
to an international gang
of cyber crooks...

02:25.019 --> 02:26.187
This heist has a twist.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.315
and a bizarre wardrobe plan.

02:32.569 --> 02:36.573
As always, we're going to investigate
and score all six contenders

02:36.656 --> 02:38.032
using three criteria.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.287
We need to rank these. We need to find out
how much money they stole,

02:42.370 --> 02:44.289
how long they got away with it for,

02:44.372 --> 02:47.876
-and how complex the heist was.
-So, how did your bank robbers turn out?

02:48.459 --> 02:50.545
-Who are these guys?
-Check it out.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.885
[Grant] Meet the Grandad Gang.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.554
-Oh, God, my back.
-[Terry] You all right, Guv?

03:00.096 --> 03:01.347
Straighten us up, Danny.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.100
That's right. They're retirees.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.852
Danny, straighten us up.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.188
Oh! God. Oh, no.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.066
What a time for my flipping back
to give up.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.652
No, no, leave it. Get off. [groans]

03:15.236 --> 03:17.488
[groaning]

03:18.615 --> 03:21.451
These guys were old chums
in every sense.

03:22.702 --> 03:26.623
One of them even traveled
to the crime scene on public transport...

03:27.332 --> 03:29.876
using his senior citizen bus pass.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.337
You wouldn't Adam and Eve it, would you?

03:32.879 --> 03:34.214
[chuckling]

03:34.380 --> 03:36.716
-No way.
-That is hilarious.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.010
That's right, that's the Grandad Gang.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.596
And now, Danny,
who is the youngest member,

03:41.679 --> 03:44.015
is gonna introduce us
to the rest of the team.

03:46.142 --> 03:49.729
Him there... old geezer's got cancer.
He's in his 70s.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.608
He's 67. He's got chronic diabetes.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.445
And the big fella there... he's 76...

03:58.029 --> 04:00.573
and he cannot even remember
his own bleeding name.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.033
[farts]

04:02.116 --> 04:03.785
Oh, blimey.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.621
You'll leave DNA behind with that one.

04:08.206 --> 04:11.709
[Danny] And then there's me.
I'm the youngest of the bunch.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.504
I've got a penchant
for sleeping in a fez hat...

04:16.589 --> 04:18.508
and me mother's dressing gown.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.260
We've all got our quirks.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.886
Live and let live, yeah?

04:26.432 --> 04:29.769
[Grant] I wanted to get the inside scoop
on this bizarre gang...

04:30.270 --> 04:33.106
so I went straight to the top,
at Scotland Yard.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.025
Peter Spindler,

04:36.109 --> 04:39.570
you headed the police unit
that investigated the Hatton Garden heist.

04:40.154 --> 04:40.989
Big question.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.907
How did a group of old guys

04:42.991 --> 04:45.868
pull off a heist
that everybody thought was impossible?

04:45.952 --> 04:49.205
I have to say,
to undertake this type of crime,

04:49.289 --> 04:52.709
you've gotta be bold,
you've gotta have a lot of planning,

04:52.792 --> 04:54.210
and quite clearly, with this lot...

04:54.961 --> 04:56.713
-[Brian] At your service.
-plenty of beer.

04:57.338 --> 05:01.926
And they used a pub called The Castle
as their headquarters.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.221
-I love your mother.
-[Danny] Heh, heh. Yes.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.641
That's where they drank their ale
and did the bulk of their planning.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.893
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.230
[Grant] But these weren't
your run-of-the-mill retirees.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.108
They were a group of outlaws,

05:17.191 --> 05:19.861
with a criminal history
going back decades.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.113
[inaudible dialogue]

05:22.697 --> 05:24.657
-So, what's the job?
-Hatton Garden.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.702
The vault, yeah?
I've got it all sussed out.

05:28.494 --> 05:32.874
[Grant] The ring leader, Brian Reader,
did his first break-in at age 11.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.084
[John] Hatton Garden?

05:35.835 --> 05:37.420
Pull the other one, Guv.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.591
Collins' criminal record
stretched back to 1961.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.093
You must be having a bath.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.721
That's Cockney rhyming slang, yeah?

05:46.804 --> 05:48.556
Bath, laugh. Get it?

05:49.182 --> 05:53.436
A 1983 heist landed Perkins in jail
for 22 years.

05:53.519 --> 05:57.231
I'm telling you, there's more tom
in Hatton Garden than tea in China.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.191
[Danny] Tomfoolery.

05:58.941 --> 05:59.776
Jewelry.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.194
You catching on?

06:02.153 --> 06:04.947
Jones spent most of his adult life
behind bars.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.200
Are you in? Tel.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.994
-Johnny?
-Oh, why not?

06:10.078 --> 06:11.746
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

06:12.955 --> 06:18.461
So, Reader put a lot of effort
into choosing tried-and-trusted criminals.

06:18.544 --> 06:22.423
He's only gonna use people
who he knows aren't gonna let him down.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.679
They assembled
on the night of April 2nd, 2015...

06:30.139 --> 06:34.644
wearing hats and dust masks to avoid
being identified on closed-circuit TV.

06:35.853 --> 06:36.979
Their plan?

06:37.063 --> 06:39.941
To get in and get out in one night.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.569
But will they make it?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.822
This is taking forever, Guv.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.532
Be patient.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.242
We're nearly there.

06:50.701 --> 06:54.080
[Tory] On our mission to rank six heists
to find out which is the best...

06:55.414 --> 06:56.624
for my first contender,

06:56.707 --> 06:59.544
I've chosen some crooks
that never even leave their bedrooms.

07:03.339 --> 07:06.134
Kiev, Ukraine. Late 2013.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.388
An ATM suddenly starts dispensing cash.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.308
No one has inserted a card
or touched a button.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.731
For this passerby,
it seems like a case of dumb luck.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.026
Right time, right place.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.621
But when technicians investigate...

07:39.208 --> 07:42.003
they find no sign of a malfunction.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.883
The explanation is far more sinister.

07:49.343 --> 07:53.097
It's the opening gambit
of a group of cybercriminals called...

07:55.475 --> 07:56.893
the Carbanak Gang.

08:00.313 --> 08:04.066
[Tory]
You see... this was no lucky passerby.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.110
This is a mule.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.906
The Carbanak Gang has taken remote control
of the machines...

08:10.448 --> 08:13.701
and commanded it to pay out
at a predetermined time.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.662
The mule simply walks up...

08:17.622 --> 08:19.165
and pockets the cash.

08:20.124 --> 08:24.837
But these ATM hits are merely the tip
of a cyber-heist iceberg.

08:30.718 --> 08:34.305
In total, this gang has stolen
hundreds of millions of dollars.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.642
And nobody has a clue who they are.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.396
They work from anonymous apartments...

08:43.022 --> 08:46.275
in the Ukraine, Russia and China.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.660
It's thought that the gang
could have a dozen members or more.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.246
They're elite level black hats.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.374
In the hacker world,
white hats are the good guys.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.167
Black hats are the bad guys.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.799
The malware they use is a combination

09:09.882 --> 09:14.470
of Anunak and Carberp systems.
Hence, Carbanak.

09:15.805 --> 09:20.101
And apart from their coding skills,
they have another priceless virtue.

09:21.727 --> 09:22.562
Patience.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.024
They started hacking
into the banks' intranets.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.401
Not just one bank.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.236
Hundreds of banks.

09:32.113 --> 09:32.947
Their way in...

09:33.531 --> 09:37.785
infected e-mails which look like
they were sent by bank colleagues.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.878
When employees open attachments,
a code automatically downloads...

09:52.508 --> 09:55.761
giving the gang control
over that computer

09:55.845 --> 09:58.889
and an entry point
into the bank's network...

09:58.973 --> 10:02.435
where they target staff
who administer the cash transfer,

10:02.560 --> 10:03.936
and ATM systems.

10:08.024 --> 10:12.486
Next, they install surveillance software,
a Remote Access Tool, or RAT,

10:12.862 --> 10:15.615
allowing them to capture video,
screenshots,

10:16.198 --> 10:18.743
even keystrokes on employee computers.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.080
Now, they just watch and wait,

10:23.623 --> 10:26.917
learning the bank's systems
and how the employees operate...

10:27.293 --> 10:30.630
how they behave,
their personal style of writing.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.345
Mimicking the target employees,

10:37.428 --> 10:41.015
they use online banking
and international e-payment systems...

10:44.018 --> 10:49.607
to wire huge cash sums into dummy accounts
they've set up in the US and China.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.828
Simultaneously,
they target wealthy accounts,

11:03.120 --> 11:07.833
inflate the funds, then make withdrawals,
leaving the balances unchanged.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.420
For example,
if an account has $10,000,

11:11.504 --> 11:15.091
Carbanak will increase the value
to, say, $100,000,

11:15.174 --> 11:17.927
then transfer $90,000 to themselves,

11:18.010 --> 11:20.763
leaving the balance at $10,000,

11:20.846 --> 11:22.181
and no one the wiser.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.475
Here you go.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.434
Just for you.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.938
So, the Carbanak Gang
stays under the radar.

11:31.315 --> 11:35.236
And the heist goes on... and on... and on.

11:42.159 --> 11:48.457
They strip each victim bank of anywhere
between $2.5 and $10 million.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.422
It's almost two years
before anyone catches on.

11:55.131 --> 11:59.552
And by that time, the gang has stolen
hundreds of millions of dollars.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.348
They're too smart to push their luck.

12:05.182 --> 12:08.310
As soon as they realize
authorities are on their trail...

12:08.936 --> 12:10.271
they simply close shop...

12:12.314 --> 12:13.232
and disappear.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.571
So, how do the Carbanak Gang
score on our criteria?

12:19.488 --> 12:20.781
Amount stolen?

12:20.865 --> 12:23.909
A grand total of $1 billion.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.995
Degree of difficulty?

12:26.078 --> 12:29.874
The ability to hack on that level
puts them at an eight out of ten.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.334
And as far as time until caught...

12:32.918 --> 12:35.629
they started three years ago
but have gone dark...

12:36.338 --> 12:38.174
so they are still on the loose.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.218
Mysterious. Did they ever resurface?

12:41.302 --> 12:45.473
Yeah. In 2015, security analysts
discovered that they were operating again,

12:45.556 --> 12:47.224
but they have still not been caught.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.268
[Grant]
Let's get back to my first heist.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.318
Where London's diamond center is being
targeted by a crack team of robbers...

12:58.319 --> 12:59.278
the Grandad Gang.

13:00.529 --> 13:04.617
They rendezvous, then head off
to the Hatton Garden vault in pairs.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.288
This is the actual surveillance footage.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.876
And this... is an 8-bit animation.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.588
They entered the building
via a fire escape,

13:17.671 --> 13:19.757
and made their way to the basement...

13:19.840 --> 13:23.844
broke through another door,
then two of them climbed upstairs...

13:24.220 --> 13:26.138
and disabled the elevator.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.269
They dropped down the shaft
to the basement...

13:32.353 --> 13:34.855
where they forced open a metal shutter...

13:35.940 --> 13:37.733
disabling the alarm system

13:37.817 --> 13:40.653
and cutting power
to an iron security gate.

13:41.403 --> 13:44.865
Smashed the lock off the door
and let in the others.

13:46.200 --> 13:50.579
Then they cut through a second iron gate
to reach the vault itself.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.666
Now, for their biggest challenge,

13:53.749 --> 13:57.294
drilling through a two-foot thick
reinforced concrete wall.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.802
[Grant] Now, when most people think
about drilling through a concrete wall...

14:05.386 --> 14:08.347
this is what they think of.
This is not what we're using.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.723
All this is...

14:10.224 --> 14:13.936
is to drill the mounting hole
for the real drill.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.194
This is not like any ordinary power drill
you've ever seen.

14:22.903 --> 14:23.904
This is the anchor.

14:25.948 --> 14:29.034
In fact, just putting it together
is a challenge.

14:29.660 --> 14:33.622
This is what the carriage gets mounted to,
and then the drill goes on top of that.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.458
-[all] One, two, three, up.
-[Danny] Okay.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.421
Okay, and that's going on.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.215
[all grunting]

14:43.299 --> 14:45.467
Down, down, down.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.723
Oh, blimey, Guv. this better be worth it.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.433
And now, for the cutter...

14:53.893 --> 14:54.810
which is this.

14:55.853 --> 15:00.024
Diamond-tipped. They needed diamonds
to get the diamonds.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.776
-Come on. Have another go.
-[Brian] One last time.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.737
Here we go. Here we go. You all right?

15:04.820 --> 15:06.864
Okay, here we go. Come on.

15:07.781 --> 15:08.949
[all grunting]

15:10.701 --> 15:13.621
So, that took me over an hour
to put together.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.833
Bear in mind the granddads had to get in
and out as quickly as possible.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.502
[grunting then farting]

15:21.670 --> 15:22.963
Terry.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.882
Oh. Do me a favor.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.508
Yeah, I had curry for lunch, Guv.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.011
-Oh, what?
-[all muttering]

15:29.678 --> 15:30.888
[Grant] All right, let's do this.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.640
Here we go. Starting up.

15:39.188 --> 15:43.067
By the time they started drilling,
it was already 1 a.m.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.322
The diamond-tipped drill bit
is water-cooled.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.409
Strong enough to slice through concrete
and metal.

15:53.619 --> 15:57.873
It's going pretty good so far,
but I don't think I've hit any rebar.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.920
You can imagine the tension
the gang must have felt...

16:03.545 --> 16:05.005
as the time ticked by.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.020
This is taking forever, Guv.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.730
Be patient.

16:22.606 --> 16:23.816
We're nearly there.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.861
[Grant] After 30 minutes
of solid drilling,

16:27.945 --> 16:29.947
I'm finally breaking through.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.496
The Grandpa Gang...

16:38.080 --> 16:41.834
they drilled three holes,
which means an agonizing 90 minutes.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.756
Before they know it,
it's almost four o'clock in the morning.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.390
We're through.

16:56.473 --> 16:57.891
-[all] Yes.
-We're through.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.066
There's just one more hurdle:

17:06.650 --> 17:10.612
A steel stack of safety deposit boxes
up against the wall of the vault.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.697
[breathes heavily]

17:11.780 --> 17:12.781
You okay?

17:14.533 --> 17:18.328
The gang's come prepared
with a heavy-duty hydraulic ram.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.169
Then... disaster.

17:25.252 --> 17:29.089
Don't do this to me.
Don't you dare do this to me.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.633
The ram fails.

17:32.551 --> 17:36.305
I'll kill you,
you stupid Japanese piece of crap.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.766
It's not Japanese crap, Guv. It's British.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.644
Just you leave it, Danny.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.398
Come on.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.192
Oh, come on, Guv. Give it away.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.694
-Come on, Guv. Give it away.
-Come on, Guv.

17:50.778 --> 17:51.820
-Come on.
-Give it away.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.113
[Danny] Guvnor, let's go.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.575
They're so close to the loot,
they can almost taste it.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.078
But they're forced to call it quits.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.829
[Danny] Come on, Guv.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.958
At 8 a.m. on Friday, April 3rd,
they go home empty-handed...

18:06.293 --> 18:09.421
leaving the mother
of all retirement funds behind.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.759
[Kari] With Grant's granddads in a fix,

18:13.842 --> 18:17.679
I've got a contender that's humble
in method, but huge in quantity.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.016
Could be a dark horse for greatest heists.

18:21.558 --> 18:22.851
All right, so check this out.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.478
Vermeer.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.188
Raphael.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.398
Caravaggio.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.652
And Van Gogh... combined?

18:32.528 --> 18:35.405
$375 million.

18:35.489 --> 18:39.034
All of these paintings were stolen,
never to be seen again.

18:39.618 --> 18:43.163
No wonder art theft
is such a prominent type of heist.

18:43.455 --> 18:46.959
It's usually carried out
by gangs of specialist professionals.

18:47.751 --> 18:51.839
But the most prolific art thief
of all time completely broke the mold.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.508
Meet Stephane Breitwieser.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.928
This unassuming Frenchman
had no criminal connections,

18:58.011 --> 19:02.099
worked a full-time job waiting tables
and lived with his mother.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.811
But between 1995 and 2001,

19:05.894 --> 19:08.897
he stole a staggering amount
of valuable artwork.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.984
And all in broad daylight.

19:12.276 --> 19:15.320
On his first heist,
he went armed only with a pocketknife.

19:17.489 --> 19:21.160
But he walked away with a portrait
valued at around $2,000.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.703
With one heist under his belt,

19:22.786 --> 19:25.330
he went off to sample
the cultural delights of Europe.

19:26.915 --> 19:30.002
He hit 172 museums...

19:30.586 --> 19:34.006
making off with 239 separate works of art.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.176
At the end of his six-year spree,

19:37.259 --> 19:41.263
he had stolen an estimated
$1.4 billion worth of art.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.185
But needless to say,
eventually, his luck ran out.

19:46.935 --> 19:50.898
In 2001, he had just stolen
a 16th century bugle

19:50.981 --> 19:52.566
from a museum in Lucerne, Switzerland...

19:54.401 --> 19:56.153
when an observant dog confronts him...

19:56.236 --> 19:57.279
[barking]

19:57.362 --> 19:59.698
-causing him to drop his booty.
-[barking]

19:59.781 --> 20:02.242
The game's up, Stephane's arrested,

20:02.534 --> 20:04.828
and the grateful Lucerne Police
awarded the dog

20:04.912 --> 20:07.414
with a lifetime's supply... of treats.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.458
But this heist has a twist.

20:10.042 --> 20:14.213
Turns out, he's not a regular art thief.
Stephane was a genuine connoisseur.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.383
In his defense statement,
he simply said:

20:18.467 --> 20:20.344
[in French accent] "I love works of art.

20:20.427 --> 20:23.722
All I did was collect them
and keep them at home."

20:25.974 --> 20:27.100
'Cause French people,

20:27.643 --> 20:31.605
they talk with the passion
and the deep voice.

20:31.688 --> 20:32.731
[Grant and Tory chuckle]

20:32.814 --> 20:36.526
Wait, so your guy
had a $1.4 billion spree,

20:36.610 --> 20:38.946
and he wasn't caught for six years?

20:39.529 --> 20:40.989
Unbelievable.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.866
So, what was the degree of difficulty?

20:43.492 --> 20:47.496
[in normal voice] Museum security's
not the same as robbing a bank.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.207
-So somewhere in the middle.
-That's fair. What you got?

20:50.791 --> 20:52.042
[Tory] Check this out.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.295
I've got a notorious air pirate.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.215
I see you're going to Seattle.
Enjoy your flight.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.435
It's Thanksgiving eve,

21:10.519 --> 21:12.980
and everybody wants to get home
to their families.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.440
Except for this guy.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.281
He just wants to get rich.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.167
Hi. Welcome.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.087
Now, you're not gonna know his face...

21:37.796 --> 21:40.048
Hi. One-way ticket to Seattle, please.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.759
Okay. Flight 305, leaving in 30 minutes.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.678
but you might have heard his name.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.096
-Book it.
-And your name?

21:46.680 --> 21:47.681
Dan Cooper.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.726
Better known as DB Cooper.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.979
And he's about to get on the flight
that made him infamous.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.605
All right, that'll be $20.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.650
$20 for a ticket?

21:58.734 --> 21:59.818
That's incredible.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.989
A couple of hours from now,
Cooper will vanish into thin air...

22:04.448 --> 22:06.366
$200,000 richer.

22:07.534 --> 22:10.871
I'm staying on his tail
to see what I can find out.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.289
Is it really $20 a ticket?

22:12.956 --> 22:14.458
-Yes.
-Thanks.

22:14.541 --> 22:16.543
At those prices, what have I got to lose?

22:18.378 --> 22:21.048
May I take your ticket?
We're ready to board.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.884
At 2:30 p.m., Cooper heads to the gate.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.886
Hi, how are you?

22:27.512 --> 22:29.890
In 1971, taking a plane...

22:31.516 --> 22:32.893
Oh, I'll take your ticket.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.436
is like catching a bus.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.939
Just show your ticket and walk on through.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.068
Whatever you're carrying.

22:41.693 --> 22:45.155
Unbelievable.
Not one single security checkpoint.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.448
-Hi there.
-Hey.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.700
There's my ticket. Where's your scanner?

22:49.618 --> 22:51.078
2:35 p.m.

22:51.286 --> 22:54.915
Along with 36 other passengers,
Cooper boards his flight...

22:55.499 --> 22:57.125
a Boeing 727.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.297
He takes his seat in Row 18.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.551
And from where I'm sitting,
he looks a little anxious.

23:09.262 --> 23:12.849
Mr. Cooper seems to be hanging on
to his briefcase pretty tight.

23:14.851 --> 23:18.605
[man over PA] Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Flight 305.

23:18.688 --> 23:21.483
-Can I help you with your briefcase?
-No, thank you.

23:23.735 --> 23:26.238
[Tory] At 2:50 p.m., we're airborne.

23:26.404 --> 23:29.533
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Flight 305.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.368
[coughs]

23:31.827 --> 23:35.163
This is your captain speaking.
We'll be flying at an altitude of 5 feet.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.333
Keep your seatbelt fastened.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.503
Once you were in the air,

23:41.586 --> 23:44.756
flying in 1971 wasn't so different
from today.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.384
[coughs]

23:48.426 --> 23:50.720
Aside from that. It's hard to believe.

23:52.514 --> 23:55.976
We'll be touching down in Seattle
in just 30 minutes.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.394
Anything to drink?

23:57.477 --> 23:59.563
-A bourbon and soda, please.
-Okay.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.484
There you go. Enjoy.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.778
Oh... thank you.

24:06.862 --> 24:10.157
She thinks she's getting hit on.
But she's in for a big shock.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.118
You're gonna want
to take a look at that note.

24:14.911 --> 24:15.829
Okay.

24:28.633 --> 24:32.512
Listen and everything will be all right.
Tell the pilot the plane's been hijacked.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.474
You need to stay calm.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.811
There's not really a bomb
in that suitcase.

24:48.069 --> 24:51.907
The most daring heist in American history
is officially underway.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.669
[Grant] Tory looks like he's right at home
in the '70s.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.797
Now, for my next heist,
I'm also going back in time.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.346
It starts at the end of the Civil War,

25:14.429 --> 25:18.433
and concludes with an FBI sting,
a television personality...

25:19.226 --> 25:21.311
and a historical document restored.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.855
So, what are we talking about here?

25:23.939 --> 25:24.773
This.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.234
Bill of Rights.

25:27.776 --> 25:28.902
Uh-huh.

25:28.985 --> 25:31.738
Originally drafted by Congress in 1789,

25:31.821 --> 25:35.242
now there are 14
original handwritten copies.

25:39.120 --> 25:43.458
But in April, 1865,
with the Civil War on its last legs...

25:45.210 --> 25:48.505
the State Capitol in Raleigh
was ransacked, and...

25:48.588 --> 25:50.048
An unknown soldier

25:50.131 --> 25:53.802
lifts North Carolina's copy
of the Bill of Rights from the archives.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.304
So, heist completed, war over,

25:56.388 --> 26:00.058
the soldier marches his treasure
all the way home to here.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.685
Tippecanoe, Ohio.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.187
And a year later,
he sells the parchment

26:04.604 --> 26:07.607
to Charles Shotwell for $5.

26:10.277 --> 26:13.780
But fast-forward through the decades,
and in the year 2000,

26:13.863 --> 26:16.992
the Shotwell family sells their
now antique heirloom

26:17.075 --> 26:18.868
for $200,000.

26:19.577 --> 26:20.578
The buyer?

26:20.662 --> 26:22.455
TV personality Wayne Pratt.

26:23.039 --> 26:27.419
As an appraiser for the Antiques Roadshow,
he's well aware of its real value.

26:28.795 --> 26:32.090
He approaches the soon-to-open
National Constitution Center,

26:32.173 --> 26:35.844
and suggests that they make it
the centerpiece of their new gallery.

26:36.511 --> 26:37.679
The price?

26:37.762 --> 26:40.056
$4 million.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.310
But what he doesn't know
is that the FBI is watching...

26:44.352 --> 26:45.395
and they're closing in.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.107
And when the sale goes down,
they pounce...

26:49.816 --> 26:53.361
and successfully recover
a piece of American history.

26:54.195 --> 26:57.032
With the Bill of Rights safely back
in the government's hands,

26:57.115 --> 26:58.825
Pratt is exposed.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.454
He narrowly avoids criminal charges

27:02.537 --> 27:06.207
by donating his precious document
back to North Carolina.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.376
And that $5 parchment

27:08.460 --> 27:12.339
is today valued at over $100 million.

27:13.631 --> 27:16.968
That, my friends,
is what I call a heist with a history.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.057
[Tory] I'm onboard flight 305

27:22.140 --> 27:24.309
from Portland to Seattle...

27:24.642 --> 27:26.311
with a front row seat...

27:26.394 --> 27:28.313
Tell the pilot the plane's been hijacked.

27:28.396 --> 27:31.691
to one of the most daring heists
in American history.

27:32.942 --> 27:35.070
A man calling himself DB Cooper

27:35.612 --> 27:37.655
is threatening to blow us all
to kingdom come

27:37.739 --> 27:39.240
if he doesn't get what he wants.

27:42.118 --> 27:43.703
DB Cooper's demands:

27:43.787 --> 27:46.206
$200,000 in unmarked 20s,

27:46.289 --> 27:48.917
four parachutes and dinner for the crew.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.419
Now, the ransom made sense.
It was a hijack.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.421
But why the four parachutes?

27:54.923 --> 27:56.132
This doesn't make sense.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.344
As the crisis unfolds...

28:01.221 --> 28:04.432
air traffic control instructs the pilots
to stay in the air.

28:05.141 --> 28:06.017
[call button beeps]

28:07.560 --> 28:10.397
-May I help you?
-What's taking so long.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.691
I'm sorry, we're just experiencing
some minor technical difficulties,

28:13.775 --> 28:15.402
but we're gonna be landing shortly.

28:17.070 --> 28:20.698
The flight from Portland to Seattle
is only 45 minutes long,

28:20.990 --> 28:24.577
but we've been circling
the Seattle-Tacoma Airport for two hours.

28:27.497 --> 28:30.166
-You're the chief stewardess, correct?
-Correct.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.336
If they meet my demands,
everyone can get off the plane

28:33.420 --> 28:35.463
except the flight crew and you.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.509
Thirty thousand feet below us...

28:39.968 --> 28:41.177
[siren wails]

28:41.720 --> 28:43.596
the FBI takes up position.

28:46.182 --> 28:48.393
Flight control, what's the status?

28:48.935 --> 28:51.062
[flight control]
He's demanding to fly onto Mexico City.

28:52.313 --> 28:53.857
Today, things are different,

28:53.940 --> 28:58.653
but in 1971, it was policy to give in
to skyjackers' demands.

28:59.362 --> 29:00.905
Give him permission to land.

29:01.614 --> 29:04.576
At 5:24 p.m., Cooper's informed.

29:04.659 --> 29:08.329
You'll get everything you asked for.
It's just gonna take some time.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.752
The pilot begins his descent.

29:14.878 --> 29:19.007
And at 5:39 p.m.,
we touched down at Seattle-Tacoma.

29:21.509 --> 29:24.554
Let's see if he keeps his promise
and releases those hostages.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.436
Is everything all right?

29:31.519 --> 29:32.854
No one has been harmed.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.399
All right, bring it up, boys.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.118
[flight attendant]
You're okay. Mind your step.

29:54.751 --> 29:57.587
Thirty-eight hostages
have just left the plane...

29:58.171 --> 30:02.467
$200,000 in ransom money is onboard,
plus four parachutes, and dinner.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.470
DB's ready for phase two of his plan.

30:06.304 --> 30:09.224
We don't have enough fuel
to make it to Mexico City,

30:09.307 --> 30:10.934
but we can make it to Reno.

30:15.271 --> 30:17.524
Tell the pilot to keep
the landing gear deployed,

30:17.607 --> 30:19.609
and lower the wing flaps 15 degrees.

30:20.193 --> 30:23.780
This is the first clue
as to DB Cooper's real identity.

30:24.364 --> 30:28.284
Tell him not to exceed 200 miles per hour,
and not to go over 10,000 feet.

30:28.868 --> 30:31.287
He clearly knows more
about flying airliners

30:31.371 --> 30:32.497
than your average Joe.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.040
Ready for takeoff.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.543
At 7:40 p.m.,

30:36.626 --> 30:40.171
the plane takes off, with only Cooper
and four crew members aboard.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.969
But Cooper has no intention
of landing in Reno.

30:49.472 --> 30:52.475
The Boeing 727 had a very unique feature.

30:53.059 --> 30:56.437
At the back of the plane,
there was drop-down staircase.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.316
And DB Cooper knew
that he could open it mid-flight.

31:14.455 --> 31:18.585
At around 8:13 p.m.,
somewhere north of Portland, Oregon...

31:20.920 --> 31:23.882
DB Cooper calmly walked down
the staircase...

31:24.799 --> 31:26.593
and stepped into the night.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.017
DB Cooper literally vanished
into thin air.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.896
And he's made no attempts
to disguise himself,

31:37.979 --> 31:41.316
so it wasn't hard for the FBI
to come up with composite sketches

31:41.399 --> 31:42.734
from eyewitnesses.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.445
But it doesn't really help you
to have a sketch

31:45.528 --> 31:47.155
if no one's seen him since.

31:47.989 --> 31:51.451
And only thing the authorities found
when the plane landed in Reno

31:51.534 --> 31:52.827
was a black clip-on tie...

31:53.703 --> 31:55.288
two of the four parachutes...

31:56.998 --> 31:59.083
and a handful of cigarette butts.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.547
For the next four decades,
the FBI investigated...

32:05.590 --> 32:06.716
without a breakthrough.

32:09.010 --> 32:13.723
But recently, they enlisted the help
of a group of scientists led by Tom Kaye,

32:13.806 --> 32:17.393
to go back over old evidence
using modern forensic methods.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.647
And they focused in on that black tie.

32:24.651 --> 32:25.485
Hi, Tom.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.028
Have you found DB Cooper yet?

32:27.111 --> 32:29.614
[laughs] Hi, good to see you again.

32:29.697 --> 32:31.199
Tell me about the tie.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.909
We knew that particles on a tie

32:33.493 --> 32:36.371
were the most important way
to find out where Cooper came from.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.457
-How so?
-Because you never wash a tie.

32:39.540 --> 32:40.708
That makes sense.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.128
And what we eventually found
was pieces of titanium.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.089
Pure titanium metal.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.216
And that's really
what cracked things open.

32:50.051 --> 32:53.388
[Tory]
Back in 1971, titanium was a rare metal,

32:53.972 --> 32:57.600
mainly used in the production
of military and commercial airliners.

32:58.726 --> 33:02.230
Remember how DB Cooper seemed
to know a lot about flying?

33:02.313 --> 33:04.482
Tell the pilot to keep
the landing gear deployed

33:04.565 --> 33:06.651
and lower the wing flaps 15 degrees.

33:06.734 --> 33:10.655
Put the two together, and you've got
a compelling suspect profile

33:10.738 --> 33:13.658
of someone who worked
in aircraft titanium production.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.414
What we were able to do
is narrow Cooper down

33:19.497 --> 33:22.375
from millions of people
that lived in the States at that time,

33:22.458 --> 33:24.293
to a couple thousand people.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.297
[Tory]
And there's one other intriguing clue.

33:28.381 --> 33:31.718
Cooper specifically requested the money
in US dollars,

33:31.801 --> 33:36.014
which made Tom think this guy
might not have even been a US citizen.

33:36.097 --> 33:40.059
The fact that he asked for the ransom
to be paid in American currency,

33:40.143 --> 33:42.061
it's kind of an odd thing to say.

33:42.145 --> 33:45.189
Then it turns out that there's actually
a Canadian comic book hero

33:45.273 --> 33:46.482
called Dan Cooper.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.068
Coincidence? Tom doesn't think so.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.238
[Tom] Actually, if you look through
the Dan Cooper comics,

33:52.321 --> 33:55.158
you will find every aspect
of the Cooper jump...

33:56.200 --> 33:59.996
from getting the money to jumping out
in the rain in the middle of the night,

34:00.079 --> 34:01.581
to landing in the woods.

34:01.664 --> 34:04.042
You're kidding me?
So, he got the idea and the name

34:04.125 --> 34:05.376
from a Canadian comic book?

34:05.960 --> 34:07.211
This guy had all the guts,

34:07.295 --> 34:09.881
he had some brains,
and he had a hell of a lot of style.

34:10.798 --> 34:11.841
So, bravo, Cooper.

34:12.425 --> 34:13.843
I'm looking for you, buddy.

34:13.926 --> 34:16.387
But I've gotta hand it to you,
I'll shake your hand when I catch you.

34:19.348 --> 34:20.808
DB Cooper, in today's money..

34:20.892 --> 34:23.394
would've stolen $1.2 million.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.395
That's a good grab.

34:24.479 --> 34:26.856
Right?
And as far as him getting away with it?

34:26.939 --> 34:30.568
A lot of people think he died, but I say
we give him the benefit of the doubt.

34:30.651 --> 34:32.779
This is one of the greatest mysteries
of all time.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.448
So, what's the degree of difficulty?

34:35.531 --> 34:37.533
The fact that he was able
to hijack a plane,

34:37.617 --> 34:40.745
and then jump out of it
mid-flight at night... that's major.

34:40.828 --> 34:42.121
But he'll lose points...

34:42.205 --> 34:45.708
because at the time, airport security
was pretty much non-existent.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.504
-So, still moderately high at least?
-Hell, yeah.

34:49.587 --> 34:53.382
I wouldn't jump out of an airplane with
just a parachute at night? That's insane.

34:53.466 --> 34:55.551
If somebody paid you $1.2 million,
would you?

34:55.635 --> 34:57.053
[both groan]

34:58.304 --> 35:00.098
-So, what's next?
-DB Tuber

35:02.517 --> 35:04.393
[Kari] September 30, 2008.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.688
A robber flees a crime scene
in Monroe, Washington.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.693
Minutes from now, he'll simply disappear.

35:14.987 --> 35:17.990
His unique vanishing act
will earn him his nickname...

35:18.074 --> 35:19.158
DB Tuber.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.289
DB was no career criminal.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.542
Captain of the high school football team,

35:28.042 --> 35:30.336
going steady
with the prettiest cheerleader...

35:30.419 --> 35:32.255
he was quite a golden boy.

35:32.338 --> 35:33.256
I mean, this guy?

35:33.339 --> 35:36.676
Totally white-bread.
He has it all. Life is perfect.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.303
Then out of the blue...

35:40.763 --> 35:43.516
a knee injury
ends his college football career.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.561
And everything starts to unravel.

35:49.063 --> 35:50.815
He turns to drinking and drugs.

35:55.736 --> 36:00.616
Before long, he's deep in debt,
and needs money... fast.

36:03.911 --> 36:06.706
And the solution occurs
to him right... here.

36:08.916 --> 36:11.377
In September 2007,
he's eating his lunch

36:11.460 --> 36:13.045
when he glances over here...

36:14.797 --> 36:18.593
and notices an armored truck
pull up and deliver bags of cash.

36:21.095 --> 36:23.556
Now, he's not thinking about a loan.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.937
For the next few months,
he stakes out the bank.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.775
His plan is to rob an armored car
using no gun

36:34.859 --> 36:37.320
in the middle of the city
in broad daylight.

36:37.904 --> 36:41.199
So, he figures he needs a decoy
to make his getaway.

36:42.158 --> 36:46.913
A few days before the heist,
he lists an online ad from a fake company.

36:46.996 --> 36:49.248
It's hiring for a citywide clean-up...

36:49.832 --> 36:53.294
Anybody who wants the job has to show up
wearing a blue long-sleeved shirt,

36:53.377 --> 36:58.341
yellow vest, blue jeans, hats,
safety glasses and work boots.

36:58.883 --> 37:02.762
September 30th, 11:00 sharp,
bank parking lot.

37:08.517 --> 37:11.187
Fifteen look-alike workers arrive on cue.

37:11.270 --> 37:12.688
And here's the clever bit.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.483
DB's disguise is fastened with Velcro,

37:15.566 --> 37:17.818
so he can discard it immediately
after the heist,

37:17.902 --> 37:20.529
leaving the others as unwitting decoys.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.328
At precisely 11:05 a.m.,

37:27.620 --> 37:31.916
the guards unload boxes of coins
and two bags of bank notes onto a dolly.

37:31.999 --> 37:34.961
For DB, it's now or never.

37:38.464 --> 37:41.300
As he grabs the cash,
the guard grabs his jeans...

37:42.343 --> 37:46.222
and suddenly, he's in shorts,
sprinting for his life.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.767
The ex-jock fumbles one bag.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.478
Now, he's half a heist down.

37:55.982 --> 37:58.276
In the park,
he rips off the rest of his disguise,

37:58.359 --> 38:00.403
but doesn't bother to hide it.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.071
He's never been a felon,

38:02.154 --> 38:05.825
so he knows there's not gonna be any match
for DNA on any police database.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.744
Now, for his disappearing act.

38:09.787 --> 38:14.458
There's no chopper, or plane
or high-speed motorbike.

38:14.875 --> 38:18.546
He actually chooses what might be
the most ludicrous getaway vehicle

38:18.629 --> 38:20.756
in the history of heists.

38:22.383 --> 38:23.301
This.

38:25.761 --> 38:27.555
Now you get it? DB Tuber?

38:36.939 --> 38:40.568
He had even devised a pulley system
to speed up his escape...

38:42.320 --> 38:44.697
so that he could propel himself
down the slow creek.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.915
While the black and whites hurtle
down Main Street Monroe,

38:54.999 --> 38:57.710
DB tubes his way along the river.

38:58.210 --> 39:01.839
His unconventional getaway
means he slips past the police,

39:01.922 --> 39:04.842
and minutes later,
he's meeting his accomplice.

39:08.387 --> 39:09.555
I got it. Pop the trunk.

39:17.271 --> 39:20.816
DB searches the bag for the GPS tracker
he knows will be in there.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.321
Like I said, this guy's done his homework.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.743
All right, for an amateur,
he had a well-thought-out plan.

39:30.826 --> 39:31.994
I know. Tell me about it.

39:32.078 --> 39:35.664
So, where did he screw up?
I mean, I assume he got caught, right?

39:35.748 --> 39:36.624
DNA got him.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.503
But wait, you said he had a clean record,
so he wouldn't have a prior.

39:40.586 --> 39:44.215
It was actually his meticulous planning
that did him in. Because weeks earlier,

39:44.298 --> 39:47.468
he wanted to time how long it'd take
for him to get from the bank to the creek.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.180
He hides his workman's disguise
behind a dumpster

39:51.263 --> 39:53.891
in the bank's parking lot and sets off.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.770
But he catches the attention
of a homeless passerby.

39:58.979 --> 40:02.858
A few minutes later, Tuber returns,
picks up his disguise and drives away.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.278
All under the gaze
of a sharp-eyed citizen.

40:08.322 --> 40:11.742
Not only did he call in and report it,
but he gave them the plate number,

40:11.826 --> 40:15.246
so it wasn't long before they connected
the dots, started to tail the guy,

40:15.329 --> 40:18.749
and wait for him to slip up.
And just a month after the heist...

40:19.708 --> 40:22.586
they get the DNA sample
they've been looking for.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.047
It matches the clothes dumped in the park.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.633
And DB Tuber's busted.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.011
So, how does the score stack up?

40:31.595 --> 40:34.056
Amount stolen, $400,000.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.934
Time at large, just 34 days.

40:37.309 --> 40:39.019
Degree of difficulty?

40:39.103 --> 40:41.605
I'd call that a solid five out of ten.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.191
Though, 11 out of ten for originality.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.193
This one's way out there.

40:49.405 --> 40:52.241
[Grant] So far, we've investigated
six outrageous heists.

40:53.701 --> 40:56.662
But one of mine needs to be concluded
before we rank them

40:56.745 --> 40:58.539
and determine which is the best.

40:58.998 --> 41:00.332
Here they are again.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.252
The Grandad Gang,
who are on the verge of breaking into

41:03.335 --> 41:06.881
the Hatton Garden security vault
when their hydraulic ram fails.

41:06.964 --> 41:07.923
I'll kill you.

41:08.799 --> 41:14.096
On the morning of Friday, April 3rd, 2015,
they're forced to abandon the heist.

41:17.099 --> 41:18.559
But here's the twist:

41:18.642 --> 41:20.311
This is no ordinary Friday.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.647
It's Good Friday, a public holiday.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.734
So the gang gets a second chance.

41:28.861 --> 41:31.530
Danny heads straight
for a hardware store...

41:31.655 --> 41:34.033
where he buys a replacement ram.

41:36.702 --> 41:39.330
And on the following night,
Saturday, April 4th...

41:40.456 --> 41:44.668
the Grandpa Gang returns to Hatton Garden
to finish off what they'd started.

41:45.794 --> 41:49.173
Curiously, The Guvnor is a no-show.

41:49.256 --> 41:52.343
And it's quite likely
that Reader lost his nerve

41:52.426 --> 41:56.222
and he didn't wanna take the risk
of going back in for a second time.

41:58.432 --> 42:02.520
I'd like to shove this
right up Brian's backside. [laughs]

42:04.188 --> 42:07.650
Either way, the new ram
proves more reliable than Reader.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.568
And before long...

42:10.236 --> 42:11.570
[cracking]

42:12.154 --> 42:15.407
-We're through.
-We're through. We're through. [laughing]

42:19.995 --> 42:21.914
All right, who's going through it?

42:22.414 --> 42:24.959
-Hey, you are, my love. Come on.
-You are, mate.

42:25.042 --> 42:26.418
Get in there. Come on.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.713
How's it look smaller the closer you get?

42:32.216 --> 42:33.175
-Here we are.
-[Danny] Okay.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.636
[Grant laughs] I didn't need that nipple.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.639
There's $20 million right here.

42:38.931 --> 42:41.058
[Danny]
Oh, breathe in, you fat bastard.

42:41.141 --> 42:42.059
Get in there.

42:43.852 --> 42:44.770
Blimey.

42:46.188 --> 42:47.189
All right.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.234
What do you got, mate?

42:52.695 --> 42:54.655
Oh, you bloody beaut.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.198
-Yeah.
-Look at that.

42:56.282 --> 42:57.408
[both laughing]

42:57.491 --> 42:59.702
I'm rich. Rich!

43:04.456 --> 43:06.166
-No, no, no.
-Nice. Now, you get off.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.835
-It's mine.
-That goes with my eye.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.713
[Terry] This...

43:10.796 --> 43:12.590
-This is brilliant.
-Oh, my God!

43:15.342 --> 43:17.219
This looks like your mother's jewels.

43:17.720 --> 43:18.596
[laughs]

43:18.679 --> 43:19.805
Go. Look at that.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.438
[Danny] Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

43:27.521 --> 43:30.983
At 6:44 a.m. on Sunday, April 5th...

43:31.817 --> 43:33.944
they load the treasure
into their getaway van...

43:34.987 --> 43:38.157
and make off
through the early morning streets.

43:39.950 --> 43:42.286
Surveillance cameras track them
for a time...

43:44.580 --> 43:46.457
then they simply disappear.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.630
On Tuesday morning,
staff return to work...

43:54.006 --> 43:55.883
and all hell breaks loose.

43:58.802 --> 44:01.013
Police forensic experts move in...

44:01.513 --> 44:05.184
but the old guys were too thorough
to leave any clues behind.

44:07.853 --> 44:10.898
During the robbery,
the Grandad Gang only used bathrooms

44:10.981 --> 44:12.399
on the upper floors...

44:13.067 --> 44:14.902
[Danny over walkie-talkie]
Terry, you all right?

44:15.319 --> 44:18.530
Yeah, I'm all right mate. I'm all right.
Don't worry about me.

44:19.531 --> 44:21.700
Four bleeding drops.
Oh, I hate getting old.

44:22.284 --> 44:25.120
[Grant] keeping their DNA away
from the basement crime scene...

44:26.163 --> 44:29.291
where they left tools behind,
but not fingerprints.

44:31.251 --> 44:35.422
All thanks to meticulous
pre-heist scientific research.

44:37.257 --> 44:39.802
But the granddads made a rookie mistake.

44:39.885 --> 44:41.220
Security cameras captured...

44:41.637 --> 44:45.140
this white Mercedes
at the scene of the crime, and again...

44:46.058 --> 44:48.602
at the store where the hydraulic ram
was purchased.

44:49.561 --> 44:52.815
Detectives were able to use
closed-circuit television,

44:52.898 --> 44:55.150
an automatic number plate reader...

44:55.943 --> 45:00.948
and digital technologies available
to them to track that car back to Collins.

45:02.616 --> 45:06.912
And then we could work out from Collins
who his contacts were.

45:07.704 --> 45:12.292
Decades of experience, months of planning,
and it all went up in smoke.

45:13.919 --> 45:16.505
How would you sum up what went wrong?

45:17.089 --> 45:21.385
They're very much analogue criminals
operating in a digital age.

45:23.429 --> 45:26.974
They weren't prepared
for the type of detective,

45:27.516 --> 45:30.018
the modern digital detective,
who was gonna come after them.

45:31.437 --> 45:33.814
[Grant]
If they'd all taken the bus to the heist,

45:33.897 --> 45:35.691
they might have gotten away with it.

45:36.275 --> 45:40.070
Instead, they all ended up taking a ride
in a police van...

45:40.737 --> 45:41.780
to prison.

45:43.574 --> 45:46.160
Come on, Forensics for Dummies?
Are you kidding me?

45:46.243 --> 45:49.913
No. Police actually found it
when they raided one of the guy's homes.

45:50.497 --> 45:52.458
Okay. How are we gonna score this one?

45:52.541 --> 45:55.335
First up, how much money
did they get away with?

45:55.419 --> 45:57.463
Well, that's the thing.
Nobody really knows.

45:58.046 --> 46:02.176
Let's go with what the police have said,
which is equivalent to $20 million.

46:02.259 --> 46:06.013
-How long before they got caught?
-Two months later.

46:06.096 --> 46:09.224
As far as degree of difficulty,
this was epic.

46:09.308 --> 46:11.018
Yeah, it's absolutely colossal.

46:11.101 --> 46:13.228
This place
had never been breached before...

46:13.312 --> 46:16.565
...and to be fair,
their advanced age didn't help.

46:16.648 --> 46:19.193
-Not to mention the gassy guy.
-Ew.

46:20.027 --> 46:23.447
[Tory] We've just witnessed
some of the most unbelievable, audacious,

46:23.530 --> 46:25.282
and well-planned heists of all time.

46:25.866 --> 46:26.700
We're through.

46:26.784 --> 46:30.829
Now let's see how they compare
by scoring them with our three criteria.

46:31.413 --> 46:34.541
Amount stolen, time until caught,

46:34.625 --> 46:36.335
-[Terry] Down, down, down.
-and degree of difficulty.

46:37.419 --> 46:38.253
Blimey, Guv.

46:38.837 --> 46:40.422
At number six, the Bill of Rights.

46:41.173 --> 46:45.677
A historic heist, but it was pawned
for just $75 in today's money,

46:45.761 --> 46:48.514
making it last
in the "amount stolen" category.

46:48.597 --> 46:49.932
Degree of difficulty?

46:50.015 --> 46:52.434
Bottom of the pile again
at one out of ten.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.853
Number five, DB Tuber.

46:55.896 --> 46:58.649
$400,000 is a relatively low reward

46:58.732 --> 47:02.569
compared to the risk,
and he was only on the run for 34 days.

47:04.947 --> 47:08.909
Number four. The Grandad Gang
tops the charts for degree of difficulty.

47:08.992 --> 47:12.496
But these old-timers
were in police custody within two months.

47:12.579 --> 47:14.957
At number three,
our French art thief walks away

47:15.040 --> 47:17.751
with a total of $1.4 billion stolen...

47:18.252 --> 47:19.962
and he was on the run
for over six years.

47:20.170 --> 47:22.297
Tell the pilot the plane's been hijacked.

47:22.381 --> 47:25.384
In second place,
the disappearing act of DB Cooper.

47:25.467 --> 47:29.555
He's still at large, and gets a seven
out of ten for degree of difficulty.

47:31.139 --> 47:33.850
Which means the number one heist is...

47:33.934 --> 47:35.394
The Carbanak Gang.

47:35.978 --> 47:37.646
I mean, this just shows you

47:37.729 --> 47:40.440
technology's advancing everything,
including crime.

47:41.066 --> 47:45.070
These multinational cyber crooks
stayed two steps ahead of Interpol

47:45.153 --> 47:47.823
to rob a billion dollars
from banks worldwide.

47:47.906 --> 47:50.409
They score high
across all three criteria...

47:50.742 --> 47:53.453
and their identity is still unknown.

47:53.537 --> 47:55.622
-So, they could still be out there?
-Yep.

47:55.706 --> 47:56.748
That is crazy.

47:57.416 --> 48:00.252
If there's anything essential to
a good heist, it's getting away with it.
