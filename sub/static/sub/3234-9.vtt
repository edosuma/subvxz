00:00.265 --> 00:02.165
Previously on Breaking Bad...

00:02.175 --> 00:03.594
I can't help you get through this

00:03.605 --> 00:06.605
if you wont me what it is Walt did.

00:06.615 --> 00:09.935
Two men are coming to kill you.
Come again.

00:10.026 --> 00:11.746
Two men ambushed Hank.

00:11.862 --> 00:14.862
There tattoos indicate an affiliation
with the drug cartel.

00:15.022 --> 00:17.022
You knew my brother when
I was with the DEA.

00:17.486 --> 00:19.306
I investigate everyone I do business.

00:19.316 --> 00:23.436
I am sleeping with my boss
and I don't know why.

00:25.346 --> 00:27.166
What's up partner?

00:27.876 --> 00:29.196
This is my replacement?

00:30.784 --> 00:32.986
In the litlle village
<i>where I was born,</i>

00:33.020 --> 00:35.989
<i>life moved</i>
<i>at a slower pace...</i>

00:36.023 --> 00:39.726
<i>yet felt all the richer</i>
<i>for it.</i>

00:39.760 --> 00:43.563
<i>There, my two uncles</i>
<i>were known far and wide</i>

00:43.597 --> 00:45.999
<i>for their delicious cooking.</i>

00:46.033 --> 00:48.267
<i>They seasoned</i>
<i>their zesty chicken</i>

00:48.302 --> 00:52.038
<i>using only the freshest herbs</i>
<i>and spices.</i>

00:52.072 --> 00:55.475
<i>People called them</i>
<i>"Los Pollos Hermanos"--</i>

00:55.509 --> 00:57.477
<i>the Chicken Brothers.</i>

00:57.511 --> 01:00.213
<i>Today, we carry on</i>
<i>their tradition</i>

01:00.247 --> 01:03.449
<i>in a manner that would make</i>
<i>my uncleproud.</i>

01:03.484 --> 01:07.387
<i>The finest ingredients</i>
<i>are brought together</i>
<i>with loving care...</i>

01:07.421 --> 01:10.823
<i>then slow-cooked</i>
<i>to perfection.</i>

01:10.858 --> 01:14.460
<i>Yes, the old ways</i>
<i>are still best</i>

01:14.495 --> 01:16.629
<i>at Los Pollos Hermanos.</i>

01:16.664 --> 01:18.297

201.6.

03:14.448 --> 03:16.916
Jesus, seriously.

03:16.950 --> 03:19.152
Better over than under.

03:19.186 --> 03:21.654
Over by a pound
and a half.

03:21.688 --> 03:23.422
I thought you were all,
like, precise.

03:24.825 --> 03:26.926
Whatever. We'll just
save it out till next week.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.729
No. We ship it as-is.

03:29.763 --> 03:31.864
What are we,
running a charity?

03:31.899 --> 03:33.432
Come on, man,
we're gonna take it out.

03:34.434 --> 03:35.501
Leave it.

03:35.536 --> 03:36.736
One batch, one ship.

03:36.770 --> 03:38.638
Stop complicating things.

03:45.546 --> 03:48.815
Why are you purposely
giving him free meth?

03:48.849 --> 03:52.318
These bitches are
bleeding us enough already.

03:52.352 --> 03:55.221
You are paid
extraordinarily well.

03:55.255 --> 03:57.356
Why can't you just
appreciate that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey.

03:57.391 --> 03:59.559
Hey, I been crunching numbers,
all right?

03:59.593 --> 04:00.760
Oh, you've been
crunching numbers?

04:00.794 --> 04:02.161
Yeah, I've been
crunching numbers,

04:02.196 --> 04:04.063
and I don't gotta be
a mathematician to figure out

04:04.097 --> 04:06.532
that this deal you made
is bullshit.

04:06.567 --> 04:07.767
We both earn--

04:07.801 --> 04:09.268
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know...

04:09.303 --> 04:11.838
a million and a half each.

04:11.872 --> 04:13.673
Whoop-de-doo.

04:13.707 --> 04:15.074
What's he getting?

04:15.108 --> 04:16.108
Huh?

04:17.945 --> 04:19.212
Say he's wholesaling

04:19.245 --> 04:21.214
at 40 large a pound.

04:21.248 --> 04:22.849
That's probably high.

04:22.883 --> 04:25.218
High. Uh, what,
for our stuff?

04:25.252 --> 04:26.452
That's what I was getting.

04:26.486 --> 04:28.888
All right, look,
say he's getting 40 a pound.

04:28.922 --> 04:32.191
All right?
200 pounds a week
for three months.

04:32.226 --> 04:34.560
And, like, what happens
at the end of the three months?

04:34.595 --> 04:36.495
Look, what-- whatever.

04:36.530 --> 04:38.598
200 pounds a week
for three months.

04:38.632 --> 04:40.366
That's 2400 pounds.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.735
2400 times 40,000 is--

04:42.769 --> 04:45.872
and I swear to God,
I double-checked this,
like, 10 times--

04:45.906 --> 04:47.340
96 million dollars.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.474
[zips]

04:48.508 --> 04:52.111
96 million dollars.

04:52.145 --> 04:55.214
All right?
96 million.

04:55.249 --> 04:57.917
96 to our three.

04:57.951 --> 04:59.752
That is messed up, yo.

04:59.786 --> 05:01.754
That is so messed up.

05:01.788 --> 05:03.522
Fairness-wise, I can't even--

05:03.557 --> 05:08.094
Jesse, you are now
a millionaire,

05:08.128 --> 05:11.097
and you're complaining?

05:11.131 --> 05:13.933
What world do you live in?

05:13.967 --> 05:17.169
One where the dudes who are
actually doing all the work

05:17.204 --> 05:18.838
ain't getting fisted.

05:18.872 --> 05:21.107
What is going on
with you lately?

05:21.141 --> 05:23.442
What's happened to you?

05:23.477 --> 05:25.111
Hang on, can't we just--

05:26.713 --> 05:29.115
Hey, we got to hash this out.

05:29.149 --> 05:32.385
Hey, what's more important
than money?

05:32.419 --> 05:33.519
[door slams]

05:33.553 --> 05:35.054
[monitor beeping]

05:35.088 --> 05:39.058
These things
they laughingly call pillows,

05:39.092 --> 05:42.061
I would not give them
to prison inmates.

05:42.095 --> 05:44.063
You want me to go ask
for another?

05:44.097 --> 05:46.599
No. Just remind me
to bring his from home.

05:49.770 --> 05:51.404
They're not moving
his legs enough.

05:51.438 --> 05:52.405
[knock on door]

05:52.439 --> 05:53.439
[Gomez]
Hey, everybody.

05:53.473 --> 05:55.074
Oh...

05:56.576 --> 05:57.610
Hi, Marie.

05:57.644 --> 06:00.179
Is it okay if--

06:00.213 --> 06:02.048
if I visit?

06:05.786 --> 06:06.786
Yeah.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.298
His color looks good.

06:23.136 --> 06:25.271
[whispering]
Gomie, is that you?

06:25.305 --> 06:27.440
Hey, buddy.
Yeah, it's me.

06:27.474 --> 06:30.409
That's you, Gomie?

06:30.444 --> 06:33.713
Yeah, Hank.
I'm right here.

06:33.747 --> 06:36.115
Come here. Closer.

06:37.117 --> 06:39.385
What is it?

06:39.419 --> 06:41.020
Closer.

06:45.092 --> 06:46.359
Asshole.

06:46.393 --> 06:49.061
[laughs]

06:49.096 --> 06:50.730
Man, he got you good.

06:50.764 --> 06:53.065
Yeah, yeah.

06:53.100 --> 06:56.002
I'm glad to see you still have
your twisted sense of humor.

06:56.036 --> 06:57.336
[chuckles]

06:57.371 --> 06:59.038
[coughs]

07:03.777 --> 07:07.079
Hey, check this out.

07:07.114 --> 07:09.749
I got something that'll
make you feel better.

07:09.783 --> 07:12.084
I've been keeping an eye
on that blue meth of yours.

07:12.119 --> 07:14.453
Six, seven weeks, nothing.

07:14.488 --> 07:15.888
Then all of a sudden, boom.

07:15.922 --> 07:17.289
It's popping up everywhere.

07:17.324 --> 07:19.525
Look at the new locations.

07:19.559 --> 07:21.494
Texas, Nevada,

07:21.528 --> 07:23.162
up in Farmington.

07:23.196 --> 07:24.764
Even right here in town.

07:24.798 --> 07:26.665
A teener here and there,
you know,

07:26.700 --> 07:28.401
strictly street-level amounts.

07:28.435 --> 07:30.269
Man, it's crazy.

07:30.303 --> 07:34.306
How exactly is that
supposed to make me
feel better?

07:34.341 --> 07:36.342
Beuse you were right.

07:36.376 --> 07:38.677
You're the only one
that saw this coming.

07:38.712 --> 07:40.346
Well, three cheers for me.

07:40.380 --> 07:41.747
[beeps]

07:41.782 --> 07:43.349
[exhales]

07:43.383 --> 07:46.352
This thing doesn't do
a damned thing.

07:46.386 --> 07:49.355
Hank, it's probably
still on lock-out.

07:49.389 --> 07:50.556
It's been an hour, right?

07:50.590 --> 07:54.160
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.

07:54.194 --> 07:56.028
Okay. I'll go find somebody.

07:57.397 --> 08:00.533
Hey, no more shop talk.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.234
Sorry.

08:06.740 --> 08:09.375
I didn't see it coming.

08:09.409 --> 08:10.476
What?

08:10.510 --> 08:12.711
Damn right you did.

08:12.746 --> 08:14.847
No, I didn't see shit.

08:14.881 --> 08:18.384
Day late and a dollar short,
as usual.

08:21.421 --> 08:23.689
The only reason I'm...

08:23.723 --> 08:27.393
even breathing...

08:27.427 --> 08:29.728
is I got a warning call.

08:32.032 --> 08:34.332
A warning call?
What do you mean?

08:34.366 --> 08:38.938
One minute before
they attacked me,

08:38.972 --> 08:43.342
somebody called my cell
and told me to expect it.

08:43.376 --> 08:46.679
A voice scrambler.
It could have been anybody.

08:46.713 --> 08:49.014
Marie's got
my phone somewhere,

08:49.049 --> 08:52.017
if you want to run
the incoming.

08:52.052 --> 08:55.087
Not that you're going to learn
anything worth knowing.

08:56.089 --> 08:58.591
I don't get it.
Cartel hit?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.025
Who would have called
to warn you?

09:00.060 --> 09:02.728
I don't know.
[winces]

09:02.762 --> 09:05.064
Aw, Jesus.

09:05.098 --> 09:08.434
Come on already.
[groans]

09:12.139 --> 09:13.305
Hang on.

09:50.010 --> 09:53.112
Skyler, I had
nothing to do--

09:58.018 --> 10:00.553
Are we safe?

10:02.355 --> 10:04.723
Yes.

10:14.367 --> 10:16.735
Are you safe?

10:20.373 --> 10:21.707
Absolutely.

10:48.302 --> 10:49.735
Jesse?

10:51.938 --> 10:54.273
Jesse?

10:54.308 --> 10:56.609
What about you?

10:56.643 --> 10:59.278
Face looks better.

10:59.313 --> 11:02.214
How's it all going?
Anything you want
to tell us about?

11:03.650 --> 11:07.953
What, like
my interesting life?

11:07.988 --> 11:12.625
One day pretty much
bleeds into the next.

11:12.659 --> 11:16.295
Been working a lot.
I got a job.

11:16.330 --> 11:17.463
[Group Leader]
Job is good.

11:17.497 --> 11:20.132
It's in a Laundromat.

11:20.167 --> 11:21.367
It's totally corporate.

11:21.401 --> 11:22.968
Corporate Laundromat.

11:23.003 --> 11:25.271
[Jesse]
It's, like, rigid.
All kinds of red tape.

11:25.305 --> 11:29.241
My boss is a dick.
The owner? Super dick.

11:29.276 --> 11:30.976
I'm not worthy or whatever
to meet him,

11:31.011 --> 11:32.912
but I guess everybody's
scared of the dude.

11:32.946 --> 11:35.247
The place is full of
dead-eyed douche-bags,

11:35.282 --> 11:36.449
the hours suck,

11:36.483 --> 11:38.317
and nobody knows
what's going on,

11:38.352 --> 11:39.919
so...

11:39.953 --> 11:42.822
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.

11:42.856 --> 11:46.592
Yeah.

11:46.626 --> 11:48.627
Totally Kafkaesque.

11:52.299 --> 11:53.632
Majorly.

11:55.369 --> 11:58.604
Ooh, from the U.S. attorney
in Santa Fe.

11:58.638 --> 12:00.740
Very nice.

12:00.774 --> 12:04.610
We've got
all these nice tulips
and baby's breath.

12:04.644 --> 12:08.280
This is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

12:08.315 --> 12:10.282
Look at these Hank.
Aren't they beautiful?

12:10.317 --> 12:11.484
Beautiful.

12:11.518 --> 12:13.452
Wow, look at the size
of this basket.

12:13.487 --> 12:15.955
It's got so many
goodies in it.

12:15.989 --> 12:17.623
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels

12:17.657 --> 12:19.725
and cheese sticks

12:19.760 --> 12:22.628
and some some fancy
designer olives.

12:22.662 --> 12:23.963
You had me
at cheese sticks.

12:23.997 --> 12:26.465
Mmm, you're going to have
to fight me for those, Hank.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.901
"Get well, and best wishes
from Ted Beneke

12:28.935 --> 12:31.737
and all the folks
at Beneke Fabricators."

12:31.772 --> 12:35.241
Wow, he gives you
all this time off,
and now this?

12:35.275 --> 12:36.409
Get me a job there.

12:36.443 --> 12:37.910
I know. He's great.

12:37.944 --> 12:39.211
Boss hall of fame.

12:39.246 --> 12:41.414
I don't see anything
here from Kleinman.

12:41.448 --> 12:43.249
They're going to have
to get on the stick.

12:43.283 --> 12:44.383
[knocking on door]

12:44.418 --> 12:46.919
How's everybody doing today?

12:46.953 --> 12:48.220
Good. We're good.

12:48.255 --> 12:49.422
How are you?

12:49.456 --> 12:51.257
I'm very good.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.758
Hi, Hank.

12:52.793 --> 12:55.261
Just going to do a quick
peripheral response,
all right?

12:55.295 --> 12:56.395
See where we're at.

12:56.430 --> 12:58.597
Moment of truth, huh?
[chuckles]

12:58.632 --> 13:00.466
Yeah.
I wouldn't call it that.

13:00.500 --> 13:04.603
All right, let's just
take a look here.

13:04.638 --> 13:07.940
All right.

13:07.974 --> 13:10.409
All right,
I want you to tell me
if you can feel this.

13:15.315 --> 13:17.283
All right.

13:17.317 --> 13:19.318
How about this?

13:22.189 --> 13:24.957
Okay.

13:24.991 --> 13:27.326
How about now?

13:28.528 --> 13:30.596
Do that one again,
would you?

13:30.630 --> 13:32.565
Right there?

13:34.267 --> 13:36.569
Yeah, yeah, I feel it.
A tingle.

13:36.603 --> 13:38.204
Okay, on a scale
of one to ten,

13:38.238 --> 13:39.905
ten being your normal
level of feeling

13:39.940 --> 13:41.440
and one bein
no feeling at all.

13:41.475 --> 13:44.310
Oh, I don't know.

13:44.344 --> 13:45.578
A four?

13:45.612 --> 13:48.247
Okay, four. Okay.

13:48.281 --> 13:52.585
And how about there?

13:52.619 --> 13:55.921
Yeah. Um, a six.

13:55.956 --> 13:57.056
Okay, good.

13:57.090 --> 14:00.392
And here?

14:01.795 --> 14:05.598
Yeah, still there.
A little less.

14:05.632 --> 14:07.032
A three.
Okay.

14:07.067 --> 14:09.435
All right, good.

14:09.469 --> 14:11.904
Thank you very much, Hank.
Good, good.

14:11.938 --> 14:15.241
So this is good news,
right?

14:15.275 --> 14:17.209
Oh, yeah,
definitely.

14:18.945 --> 14:22.448
It looks like
some nerve function
is returning.

14:22.482 --> 14:24.583
Oh, thank God.

14:24.618 --> 14:27.620
All right, so when do we
get him walking again?

14:33.226 --> 14:38.230
Marie, it's important that
we manage our expectations.

14:39.633 --> 14:41.867
We're talking about
months of very hard work,

14:41.902 --> 14:44.970
and even then the odds,
they're not great.

14:45.005 --> 14:47.206
But you can't know
for sure.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.374
No.

14:48.408 --> 14:50.075
When does he start
physical therapy?

14:50.110 --> 14:53.879
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.
It's high priority.

14:53.914 --> 14:56.549
We should have
pre-authorization
the next few days.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.551
Certainly by early next week.

14:58.585 --> 14:59.985
[Marie]
Next week?

15:00.020 --> 15:02.621
No, that's not
going to do it.

15:02.656 --> 15:05.057
I've looked into this.

15:05.091 --> 15:06.792
The sooner
physical therapy begins,

15:06.826 --> 15:08.561
the better his chances are.

15:08.595 --> 15:10.529
He needs daily sessions.

15:10.564 --> 15:11.730
Isn't that right?

15:11.765 --> 15:13.132
Well--
Actually,

15:13.166 --> 15:14.667
your plan's treatment program

15:14.701 --> 15:16.569
covers four sessions a week.

15:16.603 --> 15:21.240
Actually,
she asked the doctor.

15:21.274 --> 15:25.911
Plan-wise,
four sessions a week
is fairly typical.

15:25.946 --> 15:29.148
And the therapists
in your network
are mostly fine.

15:29.182 --> 15:32.117
Mostly fine? Okay.
There's a ringing endorsement.

15:32.152 --> 15:37.523
Look, if Hank had
more physical therapy,

15:37.557 --> 15:39.525
with better therapists,

15:39.559 --> 15:42.861
wouldn't it be more likely
he would walk?

15:44.731 --> 15:47.967
It's very hard to say, Marie.

15:48.001 --> 15:52.538
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

15:52.572 --> 15:54.873
Is it absolutely optimal?

15:54.908 --> 15:58.210
Yo5 know, screw it.

15:58.244 --> 16:00.045
I'm going to make sure
he gets what he needs,

16:00.080 --> 16:01.680
and they can just
reimburse me later.

16:01.715 --> 16:04.883
Mrs. Schrader,
I get your frustration.
Really, I do.

16:04.918 --> 16:08.220
But my best advice
is stay in the network.

16:08.254 --> 16:09.488
Don't go out of pocket.

16:09.522 --> 16:11.890
Physical therapy
is just the beginning.

16:11.925 --> 16:15.561
We're talking nursing care,
modifications to your home,

16:15.595 --> 16:18.230
occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

16:18.264 --> 16:21.900
It could run into
the hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

16:21.935 --> 16:23.569
So what?

16:23.603 --> 16:25.904
We're just supposed
to compromise on his care?

16:25.939 --> 16:29.508
Well, if you don't follow
the insurance company's
procedures,

16:29.542 --> 16:31.143
they may never
pay you back.

16:31.177 --> 16:33.178
I've seen patients
and their families
go bankrupt,

16:33.213 --> 16:35.514
waiting to be reimbursed.

16:35.548 --> 16:38.817
Who is the best
physical therapist
that you know?

16:38.852 --> 16:41.186
I can give you some names.

16:41.221 --> 16:43.522
But they're not likely
to be on your plan.

16:43.556 --> 16:44.923
To hell with the plan.

17:00.907 --> 17:02.241
[door chime dings]

17:03.576 --> 17:05.377
Yeah, there he is.

17:05.412 --> 17:07.945
Finally. I went ahead
and started without you.

17:07.981 --> 17:11.183
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
He's in for the full treatment.

17:11.217 --> 17:14.887
Kick off your shoes.
Lay back. Exfoliate.

17:14.921 --> 17:15.921
Maybe later.

17:15.954 --> 17:17.056
So, where's the maestro?

17:17.089 --> 17:18.557
Out parking the mini-van?

17:18.590 --> 17:19.858
What do I look like,
his shadow?

17:19.893 --> 17:21.060
Who cares where he's at?

17:21.094 --> 17:22.728
What am I doing here?

17:22.762 --> 17:25.564
Well, I was going
to have you two flip a coin,

17:25.598 --> 17:29.702
but since the genius
can't be bothered,

17:29.736 --> 17:31.503
today's your lucky day.

17:31.538 --> 17:33.906
Look around, kiddo.
It's all yours.

17:33.940 --> 17:38.444
What? This?

17:38.478 --> 17:42.514
Yeah. You are now the owner
of this fine establishment.

17:42.549 --> 17:43.849
For free?

17:43.883 --> 17:45.517
Free?
Ladies, cover your ears.

17:45.552 --> 17:48.787
No, not free.

17:48.822 --> 17:51.190
Look, hey,
this is a squeaky-clean,

17:51.224 --> 17:53.859
highly profitable--
at least potentially--

17:53.893 --> 17:55.327
local institution,

17:55.361 --> 17:57.196
looked upon with favor
by the Chamber of Commerce.

17:57.230 --> 17:58.697
Better Business Bureau.

17:58.732 --> 18:01.867
At $312,000, it's a steal.

18:01.901 --> 18:04.203
312,000?

18:04.237 --> 18:05.871
Don't you get it?

18:05.905 --> 18:08.073
On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

18:08.108 --> 18:12.945
On the inside,
it's the best money laundry
a growing boy could ask for.

18:15.048 --> 18:16.281
Wait, wait.

18:16.316 --> 18:18.250
Wait.

18:18.284 --> 18:19.885
Ladies, thank you.
Thank you. Good job.

18:19.919 --> 18:21.186
Come back here.

18:21.221 --> 18:23.722
Sit. Come on.

18:25.258 --> 18:27.826
Humor me here for a second.

18:27.861 --> 18:30.429
Now, you know you need
to launder your money,
right?

18:31.865 --> 18:33.232
Do you understand
the basics of it?

18:33.266 --> 18:35.434
Placement, layering,
integration?

18:35.468 --> 18:38.504
I ain't buying
no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

18:38.538 --> 18:40.439
You want to stay
out of jail, don't you?

18:40.473 --> 18:43.175
You want to keep
your money and your freedom.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.843
Because I got three
little letters for you.

18:44.878 --> 18:46.178
IRS.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.480
If they can get Capone,
they can get you.

18:48.515 --> 18:51.517
Hey, look.
Here's you, right?

18:51.551 --> 18:53.185
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

18:53.219 --> 18:55.187
Okay, here's your cash.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.856
You're out on the town.
You're partying hearty.

18:57.891 --> 18:59.858
You're knocking boots
with the chickie babes.

18:59.893 --> 19:03.228
Oh, who's this?
It's the tax man.

19:03.263 --> 19:05.197
And he's looking at you.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.532
What does he see?

19:06.566 --> 19:09.201
He sees a young fellow
with a big, fancy house,

19:09.235 --> 19:12.204
unlimited cash supply,
and no job.

19:12.238 --> 19:15.407
Now what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

19:15.441 --> 19:17.209
I'm a drug dealer.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.744
[imitates buzzer]
Wrong.

19:18.778 --> 19:20.546
Million times worse.

19:20.580 --> 19:22.548
You're a tax cheat.

19:22.582 --> 19:25.050
What do they do?
They take every penny,

19:25.084 --> 19:28.220
and you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

19:28.254 --> 19:31.023
Ouch.
What was your mistake?

19:31.057 --> 19:33.592
You didn't launder
your money.

19:33.626 --> 19:35.494
Now, you give me
your money.

19:35.528 --> 19:37.496
That's called placement.

19:37.530 --> 19:39.698
Hand me that
little thinGod bin.

19:41.534 --> 19:43.769
This is the nail salon,
right?

19:43.803 --> 19:45.504
I take your dirty money

19:45.538 --> 19:49.908
and I slip it into the salon's
nice, clean cash flow.

19:49.943 --> 19:52.177
That's called layering.

19:52.212 --> 19:53.378
Final step, integration.

19:53.413 --> 19:56.748
The revenues from the salon
go to the owner.

19:56.783 --> 20:00.519
That's you.
Your filthy drug money
has been transformed

20:00.553 --> 20:03.522
into nice, clean,
taxable income,

20:03.556 --> 20:07.693
brought to you by
a savvy investment
in a thriving business.

20:09.229 --> 20:13.532
So you want me
to buy this place
so I can pay taxes.

20:13.566 --> 20:14.800
I'm a criminal, yo.

20:14.834 --> 20:18.203
Yeah, and if you want
to stay a criminal

20:18.238 --> 20:20.539
and not become,
say, a convict,

20:20.573 --> 20:23.542
then maybe you should grow up
and listen to your lawyer.

20:23.576 --> 20:27.579
Right, so you can get
your 5%.

20:27.614 --> 20:28.881
No, that's 17%.

20:28.915 --> 20:30.883
I heard you say 5.

20:30.917 --> 20:32.551
You said it
right in front of me.

20:32.585 --> 20:33.886
Yeah. That was
for your partner.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.721
It's privileges
of seniority and all.

20:35.755 --> 20:39.591
But for you, it's the usual.
17%, and that's a bargain.

20:39.626 --> 20:41.493
Hey, what, you--
Hey, listen to--

20:41.527 --> 20:44.563
Come on, I'm talking to you
about your future here.

20:44.597 --> 20:46.665
Listen to reason.

21:27.874 --> 21:30.275
How is your
brother-in-law?

21:32.078 --> 21:34.880
He'll live.

21:34.914 --> 21:37.549
Good. I'm glad.

21:40.787 --> 21:43.822
Walter, you seem troubled.

21:43.856 --> 21:45.524
How can I help you?

21:48.428 --> 21:52.364
I asked to see you
in order to...

21:52.398 --> 21:55.734
clear the air.

21:55.768 --> 21:59.871
There are some issues

21:59.906 --> 22:03.175
that could cause
a misunderstanding between us,

22:03.209 --> 22:07.279
and I think it's
in our best interest

22:07.313 --> 22:10.382
to lay the cards
on the table.

22:12.352 --> 22:14.052
That's the best way
to do business.

22:17.557 --> 22:19.224
My brother-in-law,

22:19.258 --> 22:21.560
moments before
he was attacked--

22:21.594 --> 22:23.562
someone called to warn him.

22:25.164 --> 22:29.234
I believe that same person
was protecting me.

22:30.937 --> 22:35.240
Those two men, the assassins--

22:35.274 --> 22:38.543
I believe
I was their prime target,

22:38.578 --> 22:41.980
but that somehow
they were steered away from me

22:42.015 --> 22:44.082
to my brother-in-law.

22:47.954 --> 22:52.024
Because of this intervention,

22:52.058 --> 22:54.426
I am alive.

22:54.460 --> 22:59.631
And yet I think
that this person

22:59.665 --> 23:02.367
was playing
a much deeper game.

23:05.138 --> 23:08.840
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout,

23:08.875 --> 23:11.043
not a silent assassination.

23:12.111 --> 23:14.212
In one stroke

23:14.247 --> 23:17.115
he bloodied both sides,

23:17.150 --> 23:20.385
set the American
and Mexican governments

23:20.420 --> 23:22.487
against the cartel,

23:22.522 --> 23:25.190
and cut off the supply
of methamphetamine

23:25.224 --> 23:26.425
to the Southwest.

23:28.961 --> 23:33.165
If this man had
his own source of product

23:33.199 --> 23:35.400
on this side of the border...

23:37.670 --> 23:40.005
he would have the market
to himself.

23:42.875 --> 23:46.144
The rewards would be...

23:46.179 --> 23:47.379
enormous.

23:56.255 --> 23:58.356
We're both adults.

23:58.391 --> 24:01.059
I can't pretend I don't know
that person is you.

24:05.631 --> 24:09.734
I want there to be
no confusion.

24:11.304 --> 24:13.605
I know I owe you my life.

24:18.911 --> 24:22.047
And more than that,

24:22.081 --> 24:24.483
I respect the strategy.

24:26.819 --> 24:29.921
In your position,

24:29.956 --> 24:31.523
I wouldn't done the same.

24:38.998 --> 24:43.135
One issue which troubles me--

24:46.139 --> 24:48.273
I don't know what happens

24:48.307 --> 24:50.609
when our three-month
contract ends.

24:53.079 --> 24:54.779
What would you like
to happen?

24:56.649 --> 24:58.483
You know why I do this.

25:00.119 --> 25:03.622
I want security
for my family.

25:03.656 --> 25:05.323
Then you have it.

25:05.358 --> 25:07.025
Three million
for three month.

25:07.059 --> 25:08.693
That was our agreement.

25:08.728 --> 25:10.662
Extended annually,

25:10.696 --> 25:14.466
twelve million a year.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.601
Call it fifteen.

25:16.636 --> 25:18.770
Open-ended.

25:18.804 --> 25:20.739
Would that be agreeable?

25:50.703 --> 25:53.205
[motor accelerating]

Part of the reason we talk
about what gets us riled up <i>,</i>

27:06.687 --> 27:07.887
in our daily lives

27:07.921 --> 27:09.489
is to help each other
put a finger

27:09.523 --> 27:13.393
on what our relapse triggers
might be,

27:13.427 --> 27:15.895
head off our disease
before it comes back.

27:17.731 --> 27:21.167
So... anyone?

27:22.770 --> 27:24.570
Free license
to bitch and moan.

27:24.605 --> 27:26.272
How often do you get that?

27:28.876 --> 27:30.543
Jesse, last time
you seemed pretty down

27:30.577 --> 27:32.178
about your job
at the Laundromat.

27:32.212 --> 27:33.312
Let me ask you something.

27:33.347 --> 27:36.082
If you had the chance
to do anything you wanted,

27:36.116 --> 27:37.450
what would you do?

27:37.484 --> 27:41.254
Make more green, man,
a lot more.

27:41.288 --> 27:43.523
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

27:46.026 --> 27:47.460
Um...

27:49.863 --> 27:52.365
I don't know.

27:52.399 --> 27:57.069
I guess I would make something.

27:57.104 --> 27:58.738
Like what?

28:01.775 --> 28:04.243
Not that it even matters,
but...

28:05.746 --> 28:08.448
work with my hands,
I guess.

28:08.482 --> 28:11.417
Building things,
like...

28:11.452 --> 28:14.420
carpentry or brick laying
or something?

28:14.455 --> 28:18.825
I took this vo-tech class
in high school,

28:18.859 --> 28:20.059
wood working.

28:22.162 --> 28:23.663
because it was just
a big Jesus--,

28:23.697 --> 28:27.200
but this one time
I had this teacher

28:27.234 --> 28:31.070
name of, uh...

28:31.104 --> 28:33.172
Mr. Pike.

28:35.742 --> 28:39.145
I guess he was, like,
a Marine or something
before he got old.

28:39.179 --> 28:40.346
He was hard of hearing.

28:40.380 --> 28:45.084
My project for his class

28:45.118 --> 28:49.055
was to make this wooden box,

28:49.089 --> 28:53.659
you know, like a small--

28:53.694 --> 28:55.461
just like a-- like a box,

28:55.496 --> 28:57.830
you know, to put stuff in.

28:57.865 --> 29:01.033
So I wanted to get the thing
done just as fast as possible.

29:01.068 --> 29:04.670
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester,

29:04.705 --> 29:06.138
and he couldn't flunk me

29:06.173 --> 29:10.843
as long as I, you know,
made the thing.

29:10.878 --> 29:12.512
So I finished it
in a couple days.

29:12.546 --> 29:16.582
It looked pretty lame,

29:16.617 --> 29:18.317
but it worked,

29:18.352 --> 29:20.620
you know, for putting stuff in
or whatnot.

29:22.356 --> 29:27.159
So when I showed it
to Mr. Pike

29:27.194 --> 29:28.794
for my grade,

29:28.829 --> 29:34.500
he looked at it
and said,

29:34.535 --> 29:37.670
"Is that the best you can do?"

29:38.505 --> 29:39.739
At first I thought to myself,

29:39.773 --> 29:40.873
"Hell, yeah, bitch.

29:40.908 --> 29:43.075
"Now give me a D and shut up

29:43.110 --> 29:45.745
so I can go blaze one
with my boys."

29:45.779 --> 29:47.880
[group chuckles]

29:50.517 --> 29:51.984
I don't know.

29:52.019 --> 29:55.721
Maybe it was the way
he said it, but...

29:55.756 --> 29:56.923
it was, like, he w--

29:56.957 --> 29:58.324
he wasn't exactly saying
it sucked.

29:58.358 --> 30:01.561
He was just asking me
honestly,

30:01.595 --> 30:04.630
"Is that all you got?"

30:04.665 --> 30:08.868
And for some reason
I thought to myself,

30:08.902 --> 30:11.904
"Yeah, man, I can do better,"

30:11.939 --> 30:13.940
so I started from scratch.

30:13.974 --> 30:15.174
I made another,

30:15.208 --> 30:17.043
then another,

30:17.077 --> 30:18.177
and by the end of the semester,

30:18.211 --> 30:21.380
by, like, box number five,

30:21.415 --> 30:23.215
I had built this thing.

30:25.452 --> 30:26.552
You should've seen it.

30:26.587 --> 30:28.287
It was insane.

30:30.157 --> 30:32.291
I mean, I built it out of
Peruvian Walnut

30:32.326 --> 30:35.361
with inlaid Zebrawood.

30:35.395 --> 30:37.563
It was fitted with pegs,
no screws.

30:37.598 --> 30:41.367
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

30:41.401 --> 30:43.803
Then I rubbed all the wood

30:43.837 --> 30:47.540
with tung oil so it was
rich and dark.

30:47.574 --> 30:49.375
It even smelled good.

30:49.409 --> 30:50.810
You know, you put nose in it

30:50.844 --> 30:52.878
and breathed in,

30:52.913 --> 30:54.513
it was--

30:57.250 --> 30:58.884
It was perfect.

30:58.919 --> 31:01.053
What happened to the box?

31:03.857 --> 31:05.825
I, um--

31:05.859 --> 31:07.827
I gave it to my mom.

31:09.363 --> 31:12.365
Nice.

31:12.399 --> 31:14.467
You know what I'm going to say,
don't you?

31:14.501 --> 31:16.836
It's never too late.

31:18.338 --> 31:21.140
They have art co-ops
that offer classes,

31:21.174 --> 31:24.143
adult extension program
at the university.

31:24.177 --> 31:27.113
You know, I didn't give
the box to my mom.

31:30.450 --> 31:32.718
I traded it
for an ounce of weed.

31:41.561 --> 31:44.096
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage
to a hero.

31:44.131 --> 31:45.965
They'll say
they're not denying coverage.

31:45.999 --> 31:47.566
No, no,
I'm agreeing with you,

31:47.601 --> 31:50.870
but I went through all this
with Walt.

31:50.904 --> 31:53.873
You'll burn
through your savings,
and then what?

31:53.907 --> 31:55.975
Well, you two managed, right?

31:56.009 --> 31:57.510
You said yourself

31:57.544 --> 32:01.080
that Elliot and Gretchen's
money didn't cover everything.

32:02.249 --> 32:04.050
[sighs]
Jesus, I've got to get back.

32:04.084 --> 32:06.519
What? No.

32:06.553 --> 32:08.120
No, no, no,
you should rest.

32:08.155 --> 32:11.223
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath

32:11.258 --> 32:12.925
I put some fresh sheets
on the bed.

32:12.959 --> 32:14.960
I want to be there
in case he wakes up.

32:14.995 --> 32:16.996
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

32:17.030 --> 32:18.898
[doorbell chimes]

32:20.734 --> 32:21.901
Hey, Sky.

32:21.935 --> 32:23.335
Hey.

32:23.370 --> 32:25.705
Wha--
What are you doing here?

32:25.739 --> 32:26.772
Well, I just thought
I'd stop by

32:26.807 --> 32:27.973
to see how
you're holding up.

32:28.008 --> 32:29.642
Is this a bad time, or...

32:29.676 --> 32:31.043
Um--
Hi.

32:31.078 --> 32:32.511
Hi.

32:32.546 --> 32:36.082
Uh, Marie, this is Ted,
my boss.

32:36.116 --> 32:37.483
Oh, you're Ted.

32:37.517 --> 32:40.319
I've heard so much about you.

32:40.353 --> 32:41.954
Thank you
for your gift basket.

32:41.988 --> 32:43.522
That was really thoughtful.

32:43.557 --> 32:44.890
It was. It was really nice.
Thank you, Ted.

32:44.925 --> 32:46.225
Cheese sticks.
Cheese sticks.

32:46.259 --> 32:47.460
Well, you're welcome.

32:47.494 --> 32:49.361
You know,
we care about Skyler so much

32:49.396 --> 32:52.064
that naturally that extends
to the whole family.

32:53.366 --> 32:54.900
Are you coming in?

32:56.603 --> 32:57.770
Oh, yeah, you should.

32:57.804 --> 32:58.838
[chuckles]
I'm sorry.

32:58.872 --> 33:00.506
Come on in, Ted.
Thanks. Okay.

33:00.540 --> 33:02.041
[clears throat]

33:02.075 --> 33:04.009
We were just having some wine.
Would you like a glass?

33:04.044 --> 33:05.344
No. No, thanks.

33:05.378 --> 33:07.179
I'm just on my way home.

33:07.214 --> 33:08.514
I just thought I'd--

33:08.548 --> 33:10.116
You know, I--

33:10.150 --> 33:13.119
I am really beat.
I think I'm going
to take that bath.

33:13.153 --> 33:14.754
It was nice
to meet you, Ted,

33:14.788 --> 33:16.222
and thank you again.

33:16.256 --> 33:18.357
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.

33:18.391 --> 33:19.759
Please give my best wishes
to your husband.

33:19.793 --> 33:22.194
I will.

33:25.999 --> 33:28.200
Thanks for stopping by,

33:28.235 --> 33:30.870
but it's actually not a--

33:30.904 --> 33:32.772
not the best time
for a visit, so--

33:32.806 --> 33:36.575
Can we just talk
for a minute?

33:36.610 --> 33:38.544
I know you need to be
with your family,

33:38.578 --> 33:42.915
but I haven't heard
from you in days

33:42.949 --> 33:44.350
I left messages--
I'm so sorry.

33:44.384 --> 33:46.786
You gave me all that time off,
and I really should've--

33:46.820 --> 33:47.920
That's not my point.

33:47.954 --> 33:51.090
I-- I care about you.
That's all.

33:51.124 --> 33:52.191
Ted, I--

33:52.225 --> 33:54.059
It's just this whole thing
with Hank

33:54.094 --> 33:56.262
has been one non-stop
horror show,

33:56.296 --> 33:58.364
you know, so...

33:58.398 --> 34:01.534
Well, I--
I just want you to know

34:01.568 --> 34:03.068
that I'm here for you.

34:03.103 --> 34:05.838
Thank you.

34:05.872 --> 34:10.643
Um, but I really do need
you to...

34:10.677 --> 34:12.411
Okay.
Okay?

34:16.817 --> 34:19.952
Skyler, I've got to say
your sister seeing me here--

34:19.985 --> 34:21.320
I mean--

34:21.353 --> 34:23.455
So what?

34:23.489 --> 34:25.090
I'm divorced.
You're divorced.
So what?

34:25.125 --> 34:27.893
Okay, let's talk about it
later, Ted, okay?

34:27.928 --> 34:29.495
Is there some reasonfor sec?

34:29.529 --> 34:30.996
Because--
Later. Ted, not now.

34:31.031 --> 34:32.498
Skyler, just tell me--

34:32.532 --> 34:34.500
You really want
to do this now?

34:34.534 --> 34:37.069
Are you really going to make me
do this right now?

34:38.304 --> 34:39.505
[sighs]

34:41.241 --> 34:42.408
Wow.

34:44.344 --> 34:45.578
Yeah, you're right.

34:45.612 --> 34:48.047
I'm--
Bad idea
to come here.

34:49.783 --> 34:52.150
Ted, I'm--

34:53.353 --> 34:54.719
I'll see you in a day or two.

34:56.255 --> 34:57.923
Back at the office.

34:59.226 --> 35:01.493
Take as much time
as you want.

35:09.402 --> 35:12.638
[Badger]
I can't believe
you had to crush the RV.

35:12.672 --> 35:14.340
Must've been, like...

35:14.374 --> 35:15.708
depressing.

35:15.742 --> 35:18.544
[Skinny Pete]
For real. That's a stone loss.

35:18.578 --> 35:21.213
[Jesse]
No one misses it
more than me.

35:21.248 --> 35:23.549
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

35:23.583 --> 35:26.185
No quotas, no one to answer to.

35:26.219 --> 35:28.687
What's the point
of being an outlaw

35:28.722 --> 35:30.823
when you've got
responsibilities?

35:32.192 --> 35:34.326
Darth Vader
had responsibilities.

35:34.361 --> 35:36.295
He was responsible
for the Death Star.

35:36.329 --> 35:38.497
True that.
Two of them bitches.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.369
Just saying.
Devil's advocate.

35:43.403 --> 35:45.471
I've got to pay taxes now?
What the hell's up with that?

35:45.505 --> 35:47.806
That's messed up, yo.
That's Kafkaesque.

35:50.010 --> 35:52.311
Church.
Right.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.981
Let's kick it back into gear.

35:56.016 --> 35:58.817
Let's start slinging again.

35:58.852 --> 36:00.019
Boo-yah!

36:00.053 --> 36:02.221
Shh.

36:02.255 --> 36:03.422
Let's dot.

36:03.456 --> 36:04.890
Life's too short.
That's what I say.

36:04.925 --> 36:07.092
Hell, yeah, bitches.
We don't need no RV.

36:07.127 --> 36:08.594
Alls we need is a bicycle,

36:08.628 --> 36:10.396
some Drano, soda bottles,

36:10.430 --> 36:11.530
Nah, nah, nah,
no shake 'n bake.

36:11.564 --> 36:13.065
Where's your self-respect?
Come on.

36:13.099 --> 36:14.533
Yo, maybe it ain't top shelf,

36:14.567 --> 36:16.135
but we could at least move it.

36:16.169 --> 36:17.703
Still kind of dry out there.

36:17.737 --> 36:18.871
Let's-- It'll sell
on the street.

36:18.905 --> 36:21.206
Who says we sell
on the street?

36:21.241 --> 36:23.876
Maybe I know
a whole new market.

36:23.910 --> 36:25.978
Maybe alls we need
is the meth.

36:40.293 --> 36:41.694
[exhales]

36:55.508 --> 36:57.443
[scale beeps]

37:02.082 --> 37:03.482
What's the yield?

37:05.218 --> 37:07.686
Hey.

37:07.721 --> 37:09.288
The yield.
Come on.

37:09.322 --> 37:13.325
Uh... 201.8.

37:30.903 --> 37:33.271
[Group Leader]
I see a couple new faces.

37:33.305 --> 37:35.273
Anybody want to introduce
themselves?

37:37.476 --> 37:39.377
Don't all speak at once.

37:46.118 --> 37:47.318
Yeah.

37:49.822 --> 37:53.057
So my name's Brandon.

37:53.092 --> 37:55.193
Okay, Brandon.

37:55.227 --> 37:57.495
You want to tell us
something about yourself?

37:57.529 --> 38:00.998
Well, why I'm here--

38:01.033 --> 38:05.203
it's just one thing.

38:05.237 --> 38:06.537
It's meth.

38:09.141 --> 38:10.475
It's bad.

38:12.010 --> 38:15.046
Thought I had it kicked
a couple times, you know,

38:15.080 --> 38:19.283
but then... Jesus.

38:19.318 --> 38:22.987
This new version of it
hit the streets and...

38:23.021 --> 38:24.288
wow.

38:24.323 --> 38:27.125
Not that blue stuff.

38:27.159 --> 38:29.861
Oh, sorry,
I didn't raise my hand.

38:29.895 --> 38:31.963
No, go ahead.
This is what we do.

38:31.997 --> 38:33.564
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

38:35.501 --> 38:36.667
You had it, to

38:36.702 --> 38:38.236
Yeah, bro.

38:38.270 --> 38:40.671
I wish I never even
heard of it.

38:40.706 --> 38:43.674
It was like lighting
my whole head on fire.

38:43.709 --> 38:46.077
[Badger]
Yeah, stuff
will burn you down.

38:46.111 --> 38:48.913
Only reason I have
a hope in hell

38:48.947 --> 38:51.549
is because it's long gone.

38:51.583 --> 38:53.551
That's the shame of it.

38:53.585 --> 38:56.354
Nah, come on, man.
Don't tell me that.

38:56.388 --> 38:58.623
I hear it's back in town.

39:02.661 --> 39:05.196
Stay strong, brother.
Stay strong.

39:05.230 --> 39:08.032
It's gonna be okay.

39:12.838 --> 39:15.072
[monitor beeping]

39:21.380 --> 39:25.216
[Marie]
I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.

39:25.250 --> 39:28.219
I will go to <i>48 Hours.</i>
I will go to <i>Nightline.</i>

39:28.253 --> 39:30.354
I don't even know if there is
a <i>Nightline</i> anymore.
It doesn't matter.

39:30.389 --> 39:32.957
They will all take it,
and they will run with it

39:32.991 --> 39:34.492
because he is a hero,

39:34.526 --> 39:38.563
and he is not going to be
in a wheelchair at 43.

39:41.300 --> 39:43.167
Jesus.

39:45.671 --> 39:50.174
Marie, I know Skyler's
already told you this,

39:50.209 --> 39:54.178
but if there's every
anything that you need,

39:54.213 --> 39:55.413
anything at all...

39:55.447 --> 39:57.782
It's good to have you here.

39:59.251 --> 40:02.019
Both of you.

40:02.054 --> 40:03.888
I just wish there was...

40:03.922 --> 40:05.690
something more
that we could do.

40:13.499 --> 40:15.166
Walt?

40:17.503 --> 40:19.370
We can always pay
their bills.

40:21.740 --> 40:24.575
[Marie]
Please, it's tens
of thousands of dollars.

40:24.610 --> 40:27.478
We have the money,
more than enough.

40:27.513 --> 40:29.881
Walt earned it.
Skyler.

40:29.915 --> 40:31.549
I think Marie
should know the truth.

40:31.583 --> 40:35.553
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

40:35.587 --> 40:37.522
I think that--
He earned it gambling.

40:41.760 --> 40:46.163
Walt and I, uh--

40:46.198 --> 40:48.533
We've had our problems lately.
You know that.

40:50.836 --> 40:53.471
And, uh...

40:53.505 --> 40:56.107
what it all came down to

40:56.141 --> 41:00.011
really was... money.

41:00.045 --> 41:01.979
Pure and simple.

41:02.014 --> 41:04.348
When Walt was diagnosed,
it, um--

41:06.552 --> 41:07.885
It changed him.

41:09.855 --> 41:12.957
Looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood

41:12.991 --> 41:15.760
what it was
that he was going through.

41:15.794 --> 41:18.729
It was more than facing death.

41:18.764 --> 41:21.933
It was knowing that
he was going to leave behind...

41:23.936 --> 41:26.037
nothing.

41:27.205 --> 41:28.806
And so that's how
this all started.

41:28.840 --> 41:31.809
For better or worse,

41:31.843 --> 41:37.415
he wanted to provide,
and so...

41:37.449 --> 41:42.687
he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

41:42.721 --> 41:46.490
I thought
that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

41:46.525 --> 41:48.659
Yeah, I thought so, too,

41:48.694 --> 41:51.495
but the truth is
he never took their money,
not a dime.

41:52.564 --> 41:53.931
He was too proud to take

41:53.966 --> 41:55.800
what he considered
to be charity.

41:57.369 --> 41:58.936
Isn't that right?

42:03.008 --> 42:07.345
So he put his mindo it
and--

42:09.214 --> 42:12.249
Well, you know how Walt is.

42:12.284 --> 42:15.920
He's-- He's a problem solver,

42:15.954 --> 42:17.388
and he read books,

42:17.422 --> 42:21.092
and he did
a whole bunch of research,

42:21.126 --> 42:23.661
and he came up with...

42:23.695 --> 42:26.030
this system.

42:26.064 --> 42:28.566
A system?

42:28.600 --> 42:32.370
A system for counting cards
in Blackjack.

42:32.404 --> 42:36.173
W-What do you mean,
like Rain Man?

42:36.208 --> 42:40.277
Well, I don't pretend
to understand, you know,
all the details,

42:40.312 --> 42:42.279
but he was convinced

42:42.314 --> 42:43.814
that if you put
enough money into it,

42:43.849 --> 42:45.983
he'd have a, um, uh--

42:46.018 --> 42:47.151
God, what is it?

42:47.185 --> 42:49.987
A statistical edge?

42:52.758 --> 42:55.393
Yes, statistical--

42:55.427 --> 42:57.028
So-- right.
...um, yeah.

42:57.062 --> 42:58.863
So he-- Every spare minute,

42:58.897 --> 43:01.932
Walt was at some card table
somewhere,

43:01.967 --> 43:04.201
and at first he went
to the casinos,

43:04.236 --> 43:05.803
but then he realized that--

43:09.474 --> 43:10.908
[low]
...but then he realized

43:10.942 --> 43:14.478
that the casinos report
your winnings to the IRS,

43:14.513 --> 43:16.047
and if it gets reported,

43:16.081 --> 43:17.248
your family might find out,

43:17.282 --> 43:19.316
and if you do not want
your family to find out,

43:19.351 --> 43:21.519
then you find
another place to gamble,

43:21.553 --> 43:26.090
like an illegal,
backroom game.

43:27.693 --> 43:31.729
You remember
all those long walks
that Walt used to take,

43:31.763 --> 43:34.999
all that time
he used to spend
away from home?

43:38.537 --> 43:41.238
I guess for a couple months
there you were...

43:41.273 --> 43:43.908
sort of leading a double life,
weren't you?

43:48.213 --> 43:51.115
Oh, my God.

43:51.149 --> 43:53.250
Oh, my God, your--

43:53.285 --> 43:56.020
your fugue state,
was that some sort of cover?

43:56.054 --> 43:57.788
No. No.

43:57.823 --> 44:00.191
He did not fake that, Marie.

44:00.225 --> 44:02.493
The night
that Walt disappeared...

44:06.598 --> 44:10.801
he los$14,000.

44:10.836 --> 44:13.637
[sighs]
It was his pension fund,

44:13.672 --> 44:15.573
our savings,

44:15.607 --> 44:19.910
basically every last dime
we had to our name, gone.

44:21.780 --> 44:24.482
He couldn't live with it.

44:24.516 --> 44:26.250
He was suicidal.

44:26.284 --> 44:28.652
But you have to try
to understand

44:28.687 --> 44:31.288
that as soon as he got
out of the hospital,

44:31.323 --> 44:33.157
he went right back
to gambling.

44:33.191 --> 44:36.360
I mean, that's how deep
this went.

44:37.629 --> 44:39.563
How could you

44:39.598 --> 44:41.832
do that to her, Walt?

44:42.968 --> 44:44.201
I, um--

44:44.236 --> 44:48.339
Anyway, this system of his...

44:48.373 --> 44:50.574
he finally got it to work.

44:53.578 --> 44:55.446
So all this is to say

44:55.480 --> 44:56.614
we have the money.

44:56.648 --> 44:58.716
No more gambling.

45:01.453 --> 45:03.320
But we have the money.

45:05.223 --> 45:09.927
How... much money?

45:09.961 --> 45:11.228
Walt?

45:14.299 --> 45:16.901
Uh--

45:16.935 --> 45:19.069
Well, uh--

45:23.942 --> 45:25.576
It's in the seven figures.

45:25.610 --> 45:28.913
Oh, God.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

45:30.949 --> 45:33.818
What can I say?

45:33.852 --> 45:35.920
I did very well.

45:37.222 --> 45:39.857
Marie...

45:39.891 --> 45:42.359
you will take our money.

45:44.362 --> 45:47.198
Use it to take care of Hank.

45:48.633 --> 45:50.067
Please.

45:50.101 --> 45:52.236
Marie, let us help.

45:54.072 --> 45:55.573
Does Walt, Jr. know
about this?

45:55.607 --> 45:57.741
Absolutely not,

45:57.776 --> 45:59.944
and I need to keep it th way,

45:59.978 --> 46:01.512
and Hank-- okay--

46:01.546 --> 46:03.180
Hank's got enough
on his mind right now,

46:03.215 --> 46:06.550
so can we just please keep
this between us?
Yeah. Yeah, I--

46:06.585 --> 46:08.519
Yeah, I--

46:08.553 --> 46:09.753
I just-- I need to--

46:09.788 --> 46:11.088
Yeah, okay.

46:11.122 --> 46:13.023
We'll talk about it later.

46:14.025 --> 46:16.427
How did you come up
with that?

46:17.829 --> 46:19.496
I mean, where--

46:19.531 --> 46:22.266
where did you possibly--

46:22.300 --> 46:24.668
I learned from the best.

46:30.442 --> 46:34.578
Somehow something tells me

46:34.613 --> 46:36.981
that Hank is here
because of you.

46:38.783 --> 46:41.986
And I'm not forgetting that.
