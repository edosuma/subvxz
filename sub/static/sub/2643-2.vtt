WEBVTT

00:02.775 --> 00:04.042
Whatcha doin' there?

00:04.048 --> 00:05.983
Working on a new plan
to catch the roadrunner?

00:05.984 --> 00:11.421
The humorous implication being
that I am Wile E. Coyote?

00:11.422 --> 00:14.074
Yes.

00:14.075 --> 00:16.660
And this is a schematic
for a bird-trapping device

00:16.661 --> 00:20.614
that will ultimately backfire
and cause me physical injury?

00:20.615 --> 00:22.899
Yes.

00:27.755 --> 00:29.039
What I'm doing here

00:29.040 --> 00:31.925
is trying to determine
when I'm going to die.

00:31.926 --> 00:35.462
A lot of people are working
on that research.

00:35.463 --> 00:38.215
So what is all this?

00:38.216 --> 00:41.101
My family history
factoring in longevity,

00:41.102 --> 00:43.520
propensity for disease,
et cetera.

00:43.521 --> 00:44.588
Interesting.

00:44.589 --> 00:46.773
Cause of death for
Uncle Carl was KBB.

00:46.774 --> 00:47.808
What's "KBB"?

00:47.809 --> 00:51.145
"Killed by badger."

00:51.146 --> 00:52.880
How's that?

00:52.881 --> 00:54.948
It was Thanksgiving.

00:54.949 --> 00:56.950
Uncle Carl said, "I think

00:56.951 --> 00:59.586
"there's a badger living
in our chimney.

00:59.587 --> 01:01.488
Hand me that flashlight."

01:02.540 --> 01:03.941
Those were the last words

01:03.942 --> 01:05.742
he ever spoke to us.

01:05.743 --> 01:07.127
I don't think you need

01:07.128 --> 01:10.130
to worry about death by badgers
being hereditary.

01:10.131 --> 01:11.598
Not true.

01:11.599 --> 01:14.301
The fight or flight instinct
is coded genetically.

01:14.302 --> 01:18.322
Instead of fleeing, he chose
to fight barehanded

01:18.323 --> 01:20.974
against a brawny member
of the weasel family.

01:20.975 --> 01:24.228
Who's to say that I don't share
that flawed DNA?

01:24.229 --> 01:26.796
You can always get a badger
and find out.

01:30.652 --> 01:32.402
But seriously,

01:32.403 --> 01:35.072
even if I disregard
the Uncle Carl factor,

01:35.073 --> 01:37.524
at best I have 60 years left.

01:37.525 --> 01:40.127
That long, huh?

01:40.128 --> 01:41.778
60 only takes me to here.

01:41.779 --> 01:43.980
I need to get to here.

01:43.981 --> 01:45.832
What's there?

01:45.833 --> 01:48.619
The earliest estimate
of the singularity,

01:48.620 --> 01:50.837
when man will be able
to transfer his consciousness

01:50.838 --> 01:53.557
into machines
and achieve immortality.

01:53.558 --> 01:56.977
So, you're upset
about missing out

01:56.978 --> 01:59.696
on becoming some sort of
freakish self-aware robot?

01:59.697 --> 02:02.716
By this much.

02:03.851 --> 02:04.885
Tough break.

02:04.886 --> 02:06.002
You want eggs?

02:06.003 --> 02:07.771
You don't get it, Leonard.

02:07.772 --> 02:10.357
I'm going to miss so much--

02:10.358 --> 02:15.896
the unified field theory,
cold fusion, the dogapus.

02:15.897 --> 02:17.514
What's a dogapus?

02:17.515 --> 02:20.701
The hybrid dog and octopus.

02:20.702 --> 02:22.669
Man's underwater best friend.

02:24.789 --> 02:26.240
Is somebody
working on that?

02:26.241 --> 02:27.524
I was going to.

02:27.525 --> 02:31.194
I planned on giving it to myself
on my 300th birthday.

02:31.195 --> 02:33.247
Wait a minute.
You hate dogs.

02:33.248 --> 02:36.583
A dogapus can play fetch
with eight balls.

02:36.584 --> 02:38.268
No one can hate that.

03:08.398 --> 03:09.098
What do we owe you?

03:09.112 --> 03:11.197
It came to $28.17.

03:11.198 --> 03:12.331
Let's say six bucks apiece.

03:12.332 --> 03:14.083
Here you go.

03:14.084 --> 03:16.736
Thank you.

03:18.955 --> 03:21.457
What?

03:21.458 --> 03:22.758
Never mind. I got it.

03:22.759 --> 03:24.293
Oh, you wanted me to pay.

03:24.294 --> 03:26.545
It's no big deal.
No, no, no, no.
You're right.

03:26.546 --> 03:28.964
We're not going out anymore;
I should pay for myself.

03:31.268 --> 03:32.935
What?

03:32.936 --> 03:35.254
He said, "If he had
woman parts,

03:35.255 --> 03:38.841
he'd eat for free
the rest of his life""

03:38.842 --> 03:42.027
Yeah, but you wouldn't be able
to talk to yourself.

03:44.281 --> 03:46.665
I'm a little low on cash.

03:46.666 --> 03:48.751
How much you got?
Nothing.

03:48.752 --> 03:50.286
How can you walk
around with no money?

03:50.287 --> 03:51.937
I'm cute. I get by.

03:51.938 --> 03:53.706
It's okay,
you can owe me.

03:53.707 --> 03:54.940
Thank you.
Sheldon, six bucks.

03:54.941 --> 03:58.711
No, thank you.
I'm not eating pizza tonight.

03:58.712 --> 03:59.795
But it's Thursday.

03:59.796 --> 04:01.446
Thursday's pizza night.

04:01.447 --> 04:02.531
Not for me.

04:02.532 --> 04:05.617
Thursday is now Cruciferous
Vegetable Night.

04:05.618 --> 04:08.971
Tonight's selection:
Brussels sprouts.

04:08.972 --> 04:10.089
Really?

04:10.090 --> 04:12.808
You're changing the
Sheldonian calendar?

04:12.809 --> 04:15.928
It's a small price to pay.
For what?

04:15.929 --> 04:18.464
No, no, don't ask.
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

04:18.464 --> 04:20.766
In order to live long enough
to fuse my consciousness

04:20.767 --> 04:23.402
with cybernetics,
I need to change my diet.

04:23.403 --> 04:25.654
Wait. Cybernetics is
robot stuff, right?

04:25.655 --> 04:26.638
Correct.

04:26.639 --> 04:28.073
So you want to turn yourself

04:28.074 --> 04:29.141
into some sort of robot?

04:29.142 --> 04:31.343
Essentially, yes.

04:31.344 --> 04:32.611
Okay, here's my question.

04:32.612 --> 04:34.029
Didn't you already do that?

04:34.030 --> 04:35.331
No.

04:36.750 --> 04:39.001
Flattering, but sadly, no.

04:39.002 --> 04:42.487
I'm also planning
to begin an exercise regimen

04:42.488 --> 04:44.924
designed to strengthen
my cardiovascular system.

04:44.925 --> 04:47.176
AKA jogging.

04:47.177 --> 04:48.761
Wait. Honey,
have you ever run before?

04:48.762 --> 04:50.029
Certainly.

04:50.030 --> 04:54.250
I've run from bullies, dogs,
angry chickens...

04:55.185 --> 04:57.887
and one particularly
persistent P.E. teacher

04:57.888 --> 05:01.173
determined to bend me over
and give me a scoliosis test.

05:04.861 --> 05:06.278
You're right.
Penny jogs.

05:06.279 --> 05:07.830
Maybe you guys
can run together.

05:07.831 --> 05:10.199
That's an excellent idea.

05:12.719 --> 05:13.953
Yeah, if we chat,

05:13.954 --> 05:16.188
it will create the illusion
of time going faster.

05:16.189 --> 05:18.190
No, it won't.

05:19.242 --> 05:21.377
Um, how does he know I jog?

05:21.378 --> 05:25.697
Oh, he watches you from his car
with high-powered binoculars.

05:25.698 --> 05:27.550
Oh, my God, that is so creepy!

05:27.551 --> 05:29.218
I know!

05:32.589 --> 05:34.924
And he says he's
not gonna stop.

05:37.811 --> 05:41.564
Then see a shrink
and figure out how
to talk to women.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:52.609 --> 05:54.693
What the hell?

05:57.747 --> 05:59.031
What's the matter?

05:59.032 --> 06:02.067
I have pain radiating
from my navel

06:02.068 --> 06:03.886
to my lower right abdomen.

06:03.887 --> 06:05.955
I'm nauseated
and feverish.

06:05.956 --> 06:08.874
I believe I may have cholera.

06:08.875 --> 06:11.176
There's no cholera
in Pasadena.

06:11.177 --> 06:12.228
Just like last summer,

06:12.229 --> 06:14.296
when there
was no malaria
in Pasadena.

06:14.297 --> 06:15.681
Well, if it's not cholera,

06:15.682 --> 06:18.583
then based on a quick
Internet search,

06:18.584 --> 06:21.420
the other explanations in
decreasing order of likelihood

06:21.421 --> 06:25.307
are Hirschsprung's Disease,
botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm

06:25.308 --> 06:29.228
or accidental ingestion
of chrysanthemum blossoms.

06:29.229 --> 06:33.032
When would you have accidentally
eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?

06:33.033 --> 06:34.617
It's part of an
unlikely scenario

06:34.618 --> 06:37.269
that involves sleepwalking
and a 24-hour flower mart

06:37.270 --> 06:39.488
with a less-than-
vigilant proprietor.

06:39.489 --> 06:41.940
Oh, Lord, my belly!

06:41.941 --> 06:43.792
Ever had your
appendix out?

06:43.793 --> 06:45.044
I haven't.

06:45.045 --> 06:47.496
I've been meaning to,
but who has the time?

06:47.497 --> 06:50.065
Let's get you
to the hospital.

06:50.066 --> 06:54.286
So this is how it ends...

06:54.287 --> 06:56.422
with cruel irony.

06:56.423 --> 06:58.707
Just as I make the commitment
to preserving my body,

06:58.708 --> 07:02.261
I am betrayed by my appendix,
a vestigial organ.

07:02.262 --> 07:03.629
Do you know

07:03.630 --> 07:05.731
the original purpose
of the appendix, Leonard?

07:05.732 --> 07:06.832
No.

07:06.833 --> 07:09.018
I do. And yet I'm doomed

07:09.019 --> 07:10.686
while you live on.

07:12.638 --> 07:14.857
Funny how things
work out, isn't it?

07:14.858 --> 07:18.560
Oh, Lord, I think
it's about to burst!

07:21.548 --> 07:23.648
On the other hand,

07:23.649 --> 07:26.368
it might have been
the Brussels sprouts.

07:27.754 --> 07:29.922
Good night.

07:29.923 --> 07:31.173
Good night.

07:31.174 --> 07:32.824
Appendicitis.

07:32.825 --> 07:35.511
What a nervous Nelly.

07:38.798 --> 07:40.132
Penny! Penny!

07:40.133 --> 07:41.884
Penny!

07:41.885 --> 07:44.803
Coming, coming.

07:44.804 --> 07:46.722
Hey, nice knees.

07:46.723 --> 07:47.806
Thank you.

07:47.807 --> 07:48.840
They're my mother's.

07:48.841 --> 07:51.360
Oh.
And the Flash
shirt is what?

07:51.361 --> 07:53.362
Because, what,
you're gonna run really fast?

07:53.363 --> 07:56.115
No, the Flash shirt is
because it's Friday,

07:56.116 --> 07:58.567
but it's nice when
things work out.

07:58.568 --> 08:00.652
Where's your
heart rate monitor?
I don't have one.

08:00.653 --> 08:02.454
What about your pedometer?
Don't have one.

08:02.455 --> 08:04.990
Do you have telematics
in your shoes connected
to an iPod?

08:04.991 --> 08:06.909
Uh, no.
What do you do,

08:06.910 --> 08:10.329
you just go out there
and gambol about
like a bunny?

08:10.330 --> 08:14.967
No. I just run till I'm hungry,
then I stop for a bear claw.

08:18.388 --> 08:19.704
Why are you doing that?

08:19.705 --> 08:22.341
It's good to stretch your
muscles before you run.

08:22.342 --> 08:23.592
All right.
All right,

08:23.593 --> 08:24.810
let's start with a toe touch.

08:32.268 --> 08:34.852
Okay, you do it.

08:34.854 --> 08:36.822
I <i>am</i> doing it.

08:37.890 --> 08:39.525
Oh. Wow. Good job.

08:39.525 --> 08:40.743
Okay, um,

08:40.744 --> 08:42.443
can you do this?

08:44.164 --> 08:46.231
We'll never know.

08:46.232 --> 08:48.534
Okay, let's just warm up
on the run.

08:48.535 --> 08:50.119
Okay.
Okay, let's go.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.204
I've been reading up
on biomechanics.

08:52.205 --> 08:54.022
I think you'll be
surprised at my...

08:56.393 --> 08:58.560
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

08:58.561 --> 08:59.695
I think so.

08:59.696 --> 09:02.030
Oh, let me
help you up.
Thank you.

09:04.367 --> 09:06.802
Oh, Sheldon!

09:06.803 --> 09:08.804
If it makes you
feel any better,

09:08.805 --> 09:12.307
Thursday is no longer
Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

09:13.526 --> 09:15.944
Here's my chicken curry.

09:15.945 --> 09:17.362
Howard, your
shrimp biryani.

09:17.363 --> 09:19.448
Thank you, sir.
Palak paneer,
that's Penny.

09:19.449 --> 09:22.201
Thanks.
And for Rajesh
Koothrappali,

09:22.202 --> 09:24.369
from whose homeland
these tasty dishes originate,

09:24.370 --> 09:26.771
one large order of
chicken McNuggets.

09:29.793 --> 09:32.127
Hey, what's my share?
Uh... 12 bucks.

09:32.128 --> 09:34.663
Okay, can I get you after Friday
when I get paid?
Sure.

09:34.664 --> 09:36.415
What am I up to now?

09:36.416 --> 09:38.750
Well, okay, with
the Indian food, the pizza,

09:38.751 --> 09:40.785
the Thai food, the tank of gas,

09:40.786 --> 09:42.454
the frozen yogurt

09:42.455 --> 09:44.756
and your rent, uh...

09:44.757 --> 09:47.626
a little over $1,400.

09:50.513 --> 09:51.847
What now?

09:51.848 --> 09:53.816
He's just expressing
his admiration that

09:53.817 --> 09:57.636
you don't even have to
put out to get free stuff.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.525
It's not free-- I'm
gonna pay him back.

10:04.761 --> 10:07.696
Shut up!

10:07.697 --> 10:10.098
Sheldon, are you gonna join us?

10:10.099 --> 10:11.667
Coming!

10:26.049 --> 10:28.267
Greetings, friends.

10:28.268 --> 10:31.303
Greetings, whatever
the hell you are.

10:31.304 --> 10:34.740
I am a mobile
virtual presence device.

10:34.741 --> 10:36.325
Recent events

10:36.326 --> 10:39.761
have demonstrated to me
that my body is too fragile

10:39.762 --> 10:42.264
to endure the vicissitudes
of the world.

10:42.265 --> 10:44.733
Until such time as I am able

10:44.734 --> 10:46.168
to transfer my consciousness,

10:46.169 --> 10:49.004
I shall remain
in a secure location

10:49.005 --> 10:52.357
and interact with the world
in this manner.

10:53.159 --> 10:54.543
Really? That's
your question--

10:54.544 --> 10:57.079
when did he
put a ramp in?

11:03.353 --> 11:05.370
You're in my spot.

11:17.744 --> 11:20.996
This may seem a little odd
at first,

11:20.997 --> 11:23.649
but over time,
you'll grow accustomed

11:23.650 --> 11:26.902
to dealing with me
in this configuration.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.838
Yeah, to be honest, I
don't see much difference.

11:29.839 --> 11:31.039
Thank you.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.258
That's what I was going for.

11:34.544 --> 11:37.963
Now, Leonard, tomorrow,
when we go to work,

11:37.964 --> 11:39.915
you'll need to allow
some extra time

11:39.916 --> 11:41.733
to get me down the stairs.

11:41.734 --> 11:46.355
For your convenience,
I disassemble into four pieces.

11:46.356 --> 11:47.439
This is ridiculous.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.607
I'm coming to talk to you.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.909
You don't know where I am.

11:52.311 --> 11:54.947
My physical body
is safely ensconced

11:54.948 --> 11:57.649
in a secure,
undisclosed location.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.251
You're in your bedroom.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.836
No, I'm not.

12:00.837 --> 12:04.172
I can hear your voice
coming from your bedroom.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.509
No, you can't.

12:09.596 --> 12:10.846
Wait.

12:10.847 --> 12:12.214
Come back.

12:12.215 --> 12:13.498
Halt.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.885
Authorized personnel only!

12:18.004 --> 12:19.371
So, either one
of you weirdos

12:19.372 --> 12:22.374
want to buy my underwear?
Only 1,400 bucks.

12:26.696 --> 12:28.864
Sheldon,
this is ridiculous.

12:28.865 --> 12:30.432
I'm behind you.

12:30.433 --> 12:33.652
Please look at me when
you're talking to me.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.153
I am looking at you.

12:35.154 --> 12:36.438
No, you're not.

12:36.439 --> 12:38.907
Pay no attention to
that man in the bed.

12:38.908 --> 12:40.208
You cannot exist

12:40.209 --> 12:41.960
as a virtual presence.

12:41.961 --> 12:43.829
Not here
and certainly not at work.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.697
Oh, good God.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.265
At my age,
do you know

12:47.266 --> 12:50.118
how I'm statistically
most likely to die?

12:50.119 --> 12:52.404
At the hands of your roommate?

12:52.405 --> 12:53.972
An accident.

12:53.973 --> 12:56.441
That's how I'm going
to make it look.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.077
Until I can transfer
my intellect

12:59.078 --> 13:00.379
to a more durable container,

13:00.380 --> 13:03.148
my body will remain
safely ensconced in my bed.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.200
Fine, but don't expect my help.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.769
You have to help--
it's in the roommate agreement.

13:07.770 --> 13:09.287
No, it's not.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.592
Section 74.C.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.111
The various obligations
and duties of the parties

13:16.112 --> 13:19.748
in the event one of
them becomes a robot.

13:20.616 --> 13:23.435
I'll be damned.

13:33.796 --> 13:35.597
This is delightful.

13:35.598 --> 13:37.599
Uh-huh.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.885
It's much easier to enjoy

13:39.886 --> 13:41.887
the picturesque route
we travel to work

13:41.888 --> 13:45.107
when you remove the specter
of fiery vehicular death.

13:45.108 --> 13:46.391
Refresh my memory.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.944
Why didn't I just put you
in the trunk?

13:48.945 --> 13:51.947
Because I called shotgun.
Remember?

13:51.948 --> 13:54.616
Right.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.956
You seem tense.

14:00.957 --> 14:03.658
Perhaps this will relax you.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.803
I don't want to listen
to music, Sheldon.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.423
Very well.

14:18.424 --> 14:22.310
I don't understand
why you're not enjoying this.

14:22.311 --> 14:26.848
Together, in this car,
with my enhanced capabilities,

14:26.849 --> 14:29.351
we're like <i>Knight Rider.</i>

14:29.352 --> 14:33.188
Except in <i>Knight Rider,</i> the car
isn't a yammering sphincter.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.141
You mock the sphincter,

14:36.142 --> 14:38.910
but the sphincter
is a class of muscle

14:38.911 --> 14:41.363
without which human beings
couldn't survive.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.701
There are over 50
different sphincters

14:46.702 --> 14:48.370
in the human body.

14:48.371 --> 14:50.756
How many can you name?

14:51.824 --> 14:54.659
I was wrong-- this is exactly
like <i>Knight Rider.</i>

14:55.795 --> 14:57.796
Perhaps you'd be interested
in a different game.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.264
No.

14:59.265 --> 15:00.849
This is a photograph of the 1911

15:00.850 --> 15:04.269
Solvay Conference on the theory
of radiation and quanta.

15:04.270 --> 15:08.774
Using Photoshop, I've
introduced a few anachronisms.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.143
See if you can spot all 24.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.644
I'll give you the first one.

15:12.645 --> 15:16.948
Madame Curie should not
be wearing a digital watch.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.316
And go.

15:20.736 --> 15:22.353
That's it. Bye-bye.

15:26.209 --> 15:27.325
Bazinga.
Whoa!

15:29.412 --> 15:31.713
I have an override switch.

15:31.714 --> 15:33.331
I almost died!

15:33.332 --> 15:35.834
And I'm safe and sound in bed.

15:35.835 --> 15:38.003
Who's crazy now?

15:38.004 --> 15:40.705
I'm still going
to go with you.

15:46.562 --> 15:48.713
Hello, Professor Hoskins.

15:48.714 --> 15:51.433
Nice to see you, Mindy.

15:51.434 --> 15:54.236
And <i>konnichiwa, Dr. Nakamora.</i>

15:54.237 --> 15:57.889
Sorry the Swedes
disproved your theory.

16:04.914 --> 16:06.915
Leonard, my door.

16:06.916 --> 16:08.150
What about it?

16:08.151 --> 16:10.969
Be a lamb and open it for me.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.921
Why? What's the problem?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.746
You think you have me stymied,
don't you?

16:21.747 --> 16:25.217
No, I think a doorknob
has you stymied.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.771
Oh, look, it's Leonard
and R2-D-Bag.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.275
That's my joke.
I told it last night.

16:33.276 --> 16:35.560
You can't just use it.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.947
Raj, be a lamb
and open the door for me.

16:38.948 --> 16:41.533
Oh, sure.

16:43.786 --> 16:45.320
He's a lamb.

16:45.321 --> 16:47.122
You're not.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.743
I'm a lamb.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.847
Isn't this nice?

16:55.848 --> 16:59.084
The pleasures of fellowship
and camaraderie

16:59.085 --> 17:03.255
without having to tolerate
your germy breath on my skin.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.339
I say we just take him
to Tatooine

17:05.340 --> 17:07.309
and sell him to some Jawas.

17:07.310 --> 17:08.977
That's two, dude.

17:08.978 --> 17:10.729
Write your own jokes.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.848
Oh, great.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.519
Hi, I'm Penny,
I'll be your waitress.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.154
Why are you introducing
yourself?

17:19.155 --> 17:20.321
I'd rather people not know

17:20.323 --> 17:22.857
I have any prior connection
to you whatsoever.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.027
Can you tell me
the specials this evening?

17:26.028 --> 17:27.529
Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.

17:27.530 --> 17:28.512
Obviously.

17:28.513 --> 17:30.732
I don't even have
water yet.

17:30.733 --> 17:32.284
Because you're not here.

17:32.285 --> 17:35.754
That's discrimination
against the otherwise located.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.673
I'm going to have
to go over your head.

17:40.843 --> 17:44.496
Manager... manager.

17:44.497 --> 17:48.216
Oh, Lord,
look who it is.

17:49.051 --> 17:51.386
Is that Steve Wozniak?

17:51.387 --> 17:52.270
I think it is.

17:52.271 --> 17:55.040
The Great and Powerful Woz.

17:55.858 --> 17:56.891
Penny,
Steve Wozniak was

17:56.892 --> 17:57.859
one of the cofounders

17:57.860 --> 17:59.060
of Apple Computer.

17:59.061 --> 18:00.478
He and Steve Jobs started it...
Yeah,

18:00.479 --> 18:02.647
I know who he is.
I watch <i>Dancing with the Stars.</i>

18:03.699 --> 18:05.700
I must speak to him.

18:05.701 --> 18:07.118
Of course you must.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.823
You know, there's an
Olive Garden down the street.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.376
You guys should try it sometime.

18:14.377 --> 18:17.362
Excuse me,
Mr. Wozniak?

18:17.363 --> 18:18.530
Oh, hey.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.432
Nice virtual presence device.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.416
Thank you.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.969
I just want to say
I'm a big fan.

18:23.970 --> 18:27.906
You're my 15th favorite
technological visionary.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.557
Only 15th?

18:29.558 --> 18:33.161
It's still six spots
above Steve Jobs.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.513
I care neither for turtlenecks

18:35.514 --> 18:37.382
nor showmanship.

18:37.383 --> 18:40.752
Yeah, I never got
that turtleneck thing.

18:40.753 --> 18:44.689
One of my proudest possessions
is a vintage 1977 Apple Two.

18:44.690 --> 18:49.210
Despite the file system
limitations of Apple DOS 3.3,

18:49.211 --> 18:51.513
it was a pretty nifty
little achievement.

18:51.514 --> 18:53.798
Thanks, we were shooting
for "nifty."

18:54.600 --> 18:55.650
You know, if you had it here,

18:55.651 --> 18:57.252
I'd autograph it for you.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.488
Don't move
for 15 to 30 minutes,

19:00.489 --> 19:03.191
depending on how
the buses are running.

19:04.994 --> 19:07.462
Nerds.

19:10.549 --> 19:12.867
I'm coming, Woz, I'm coming.

19:12.868 --> 19:13.835
Ow!

19:13.836 --> 19:15.186
Oh!

19:18.190 --> 19:20.392
Aw.

19:34.501 --> 19:39.471
Penny... Penny... Penny.

19:41.357 --> 19:43.475
What up, Shel-Bot?

19:43.476 --> 19:45.344
I can't get out of bed.

19:45.345 --> 19:46.729
I hurt my ankle.

19:46.730 --> 19:48.313
What do you want me to do?

19:48.314 --> 19:50.649
Sing me "Soft Kitty."

19:50.650 --> 19:53.352
Really, you want me
to sing "Soft Kitty"

19:53.353 --> 19:54.987
to a computer monitor?

19:54.988 --> 19:57.823
Would you rather come over
and sing it to me in person?
