WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:06.105
Well, thanks, charlie.
That was... Sex.

00:06.107 --> 00:09.041
Hey, I had one off-night.
Check my stats.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.609
Whenever you have a runner
in scoring position,

00:10.611 --> 00:13.545
I always drive one up the gap
and bring him home.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.281
Can we not call it
"the gap"?

00:16.283 --> 00:18.650
I prefer the term
my mother used--

00:18.652 --> 00:21.620
"the shameful place
we do not touch."

00:21.622 --> 00:24.556
I'm just saying,
it's usually amazing.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.593
Even you have nights
where you're tired
or distracted.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.229
Hey, my just lying
there is better than most
women moving.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.599
And that comes from a review
of me on yelp.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.467
I'll make it up
to you next time.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.136
How do you know
there'll be a next time?

00:37.138 --> 00:39.571
Because I'm convenient.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.241
And whether you want
to admit it or not,

00:42.243 --> 00:44.543
You like spending
time with me.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.746
Or perhaps I'm just
biologically compelled
to act nicer to you

00:47.748 --> 00:50.416
Because my oxytocin
levels rise during sex.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.252
You, on the other hand,
are always swimming
in oxytocin.

00:53.254 --> 00:56.688
Well, come on in.
The oxytocin's fine.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.392
Do you ever have an emotion
you don't act on?

01:00.394 --> 01:01.827
You're like a toddler

01:01.829 --> 01:04.630
Or one of those women
on "the price is right."

01:04.632 --> 01:07.533
I've got to go.
I've got a meeting
tomorrow morning

01:07.535 --> 01:09.468
At the public
defender's office.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.538
I'm in the running for a job
as an expert witness.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.174
Why doesn't anyone ever ask
me to be an expert witness?
I'd be great at it.

01:15.176 --> 01:18.544
You?
( laughs )

01:18.546 --> 01:21.113
- What?
- Come on.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.849
I've got a doctorate.
I have major credentials.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.752
- I've been published.
- So have I.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.787
You had an ad
in the "pennysaver."

01:28.789 --> 01:30.722
Not in.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.425
I had the cover.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.294
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Hold on. Hold on.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.796
I'm licensed.
I'm board-certified.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.833
And I'm good-looking.

01:40.835 --> 01:42.768
Juries trust
good-looking people.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.670
- It's a scientific fact.
- Who told you that?

01:44.672 --> 01:46.805
Some girl I met in a bar.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.740
Why would she lie?
She was beautiful.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.613
I don't think
the public defender's
gonna hire you, charlie.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.448
She has very high standards.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.317
It's a woman?

01:58.319 --> 02:00.419
I can make this happen.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.654
Give me her name.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.424
Okay, fine.
If you're up
for the rejection.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.626
Her name is shelley trahan.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.795
No way.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.830
- What, you know her?
- Yeah.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.533
Back when I was
a ballplayer, I got
into a bar fight.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.502
I needed a lawyer
and she handled my case.

02:16.504 --> 02:19.705
She might have also
handled some other things.

02:19.707 --> 02:23.642
And we might have slept
together and I might have
never called her back.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.212
Well, now we know why
you might never get

02:27.214 --> 02:29.181
An expert witness gig.
Hmm.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.883
Wait, excuse me?

02:30.885 --> 02:32.751
Could you please
say something positive,

02:32.753 --> 02:34.753
Encouraging, or nice
before you go?

02:34.755 --> 02:38.891
I think you have a childlike
sense of wonder.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.459
Thank you.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.828
If you think you're getting
an expert witness gig.

02:43.930 --> 02:47.432
And I'm <i>positive</i>
<i>about that.</i>

02:47.434 --> 02:51.937
And I'm <i>encouraging</i> you
to avoid the embarrassment.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.839
And?

02:53.841 --> 02:55.908
<i>Nice</i> talking to you.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.513
First of all, shelley,
thanks for seeing me.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.915
You look great.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.417
And obviously
you're doing great.
I'm impressed.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.852
Forget about me.
What about you?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.720
An anger management
therapist?

03:08.722 --> 03:11.190
Honestly, I didn't see
a real bright future

03:11.192 --> 03:13.458
For that ticking time bomb
I saw arguing

03:13.460 --> 03:15.460
With the toilet
in the drunk tank.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.895
That was a toilet?

03:16.897 --> 03:20.232
I thought it was a short
white guy with a big mouth.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.668
What can I do for you?

03:22.670 --> 03:24.770
Well, before I get to that,
I want to apologize

03:24.772 --> 03:27.873
For never calling you back.
I felt terrible about it.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.876
Charlie, it was
a million years ago.
It's forgotten.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.312
So forgotten that
you'd be willing to, say,

03:33.314 --> 03:35.881
Put me on the list of expert
witnesses that you hire?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.950
Well, I don't know.
Let me ask you a question.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.952
If I called you
to be an expert witness,

03:39.954 --> 03:43.722
Would you, say,
call me back?

03:43.724 --> 03:47.392
Are you kidding?
When I want something,
I call back.

03:48.995 --> 03:51.396
I mean, now I have
the confidence

03:51.398 --> 03:53.532
To call back
when it's something I want.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.334
I was so intimidated by you.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.336
Charlie, shut up.
I'm screwing with you.

03:57.338 --> 04:01.740
In fact, I have a case
coming up, but I already
have somebody in mind.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.942
Do you know a kate wales?

04:03.944 --> 04:07.613
Know her? We're friends.
We went to grad school together.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.814
Well, what do you
think of her?

04:08.816 --> 04:09.982
Is she a better choice
than you?

04:09.984 --> 04:12.551
Wow, big question.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.920
Well, she has
the credentials

04:14.922 --> 04:17.289
And I would never
say anything bad about kate,

04:17.291 --> 04:20.525
But she's cold,
arrogant...

04:21.894 --> 04:23.795
And she has this
very annoying habit

04:23.797 --> 04:26.365
Of underestimating
her opponents.

04:26.367 --> 04:29.935
So you came down here
to apologize to me

04:29.937 --> 04:31.937
For screwing me over
and, while you're at it,

04:31.939 --> 04:34.840
You screw over your friend?

04:34.842 --> 04:36.842
I guess it sounds
pretty bad, doesn't it?

04:36.844 --> 04:39.478
No. It sounds perfect.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.980
I am looking for a witness
who wants to win at all costs

04:41.982 --> 04:43.849
With no scruples whatsoever.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.985
Well, I think our history
has proved that I have
no scruples.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.921
You're hired.
I'll send over the case
files later.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.524
Thank you.
And I won't disappoint you.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.960
I really hope this isn't
gonna be a onetime thing.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.895
Wow, I've said that
before, haven't I?

04:58.498 --> 05:00.799
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

05:02.568 --> 05:05.704
I got my den fixed up
exactly like I want it--

05:05.706 --> 05:07.572
Wood paneling, deer head
on the wall,

05:07.574 --> 05:08.907
Flat screen tv.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.942
Freshly opened can
of whup-ass.

05:12.345 --> 05:14.680
Ed, it sounds to me
like you have a man cave.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.481
What the hell
is a man cave?

05:16.483 --> 05:18.917
It's a place where you keep
all your favorite stuff.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.952
You can do whatever you want
and nobody bothers you.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.355
Used to be called your life,
but then you got married.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.857
So now it's just a room.

05:25.859 --> 05:29.928
Well, the problem is
my wife is in there
more than I am.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.697
She said I needed
a plant in there,

05:31.699 --> 05:33.498
So now she's in there
all the time

05:33.500 --> 05:35.567
Taking care
of the plant.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.503
You know, feeding it,
watering it, talking to it.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.938
What does she say to it?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.940
"we need to go out some.
We never do nothing.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.743
Are you listening
to me at all?"

05:44.745 --> 05:46.812
I think she's talking
to you.

05:46.814 --> 05:50.382
Oh, that makes sense.

05:50.384 --> 05:53.819
The woman's lonely.
She's desperate for company.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.954
I don't need that
in my den.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.056
How do I get her
out of there?

05:58.058 --> 06:01.660
- I have a similar--
- say it in your head.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.996
Give me $500
and I'll figure out a way
to get your wife out.

06:04.998 --> 06:08.900
Lacey, I don't think
the problem is getting
ed's wife out of his den.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.769
But then I can't make $500

06:10.771 --> 06:12.871
To get a pair
of leopard print
shoes that I want.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.973
Lacey, we're trying
to be supportive here,

06:14.975 --> 06:16.675
Not make money for shoes.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.943
They're not just shoes,
they're a symbol.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.512
A symbol of how much
I want things.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.482
Okay, I think
we're out of time,

06:23.484 --> 06:26.051
So you'll have to continue
this conversation about shoes

06:26.053 --> 06:27.953
Without a licensed therapist
in the room.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.021
Nolan, can I see you
for a second?

06:34.127 --> 06:36.728
I noticed that you're having
some trouble getting your
thoughts out in group.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.064
You know, sometimes we can
better express ourselves

06:39.066 --> 06:40.932
Through art
than we can through words.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.468
So this weekend,
I want you to paint anything

06:43.470 --> 06:46.004
That upsets you,
belittles you,
or humiliates you.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.708
Like the way I've been singled
out for this assignment?

06:49.710 --> 06:53.011
Nolan, this is not meant
to be a punishment.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.146
Well, could it be?

06:56.082 --> 06:58.917
I've been an artist
for, like, a minute and I'm
already blocked.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.523
Surprise.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.625
Hey, what's going on?

07:06.627 --> 07:09.127
This is for you.
Congratulations on
getting the job.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.030
- The better man won.
- Listen, I was gonna tell you.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.833
I feel bad that shelley
picked me over you,

07:14.835 --> 07:17.469
The doctor with all
the qualifications.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.037
Gee, I don't know
what to wish for.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.740
I pretty much got
everything I want.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.646
Is there a pony
standing next to me?

07:27.648 --> 07:30.715
Stop being a jerk.
I'm happy for you.

07:30.717 --> 07:34.119
Really? You are?
Well, that's very
mature of you.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.887
Of course,
when I found out,

07:35.889 --> 07:37.823
I immediately went
to the prosecution

07:37.825 --> 07:41.460
And got a job as their
expert witness.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.697
Do you want to light
my candle for me?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.799
Oh, what am I talking about?
I can do it myself.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.201
I'm a doctor.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.839
We're gonna be on
opposite sides of the case?

07:53.841 --> 07:56.007
We're sleeping together.
Isn't that completely unethical?

07:56.009 --> 07:58.009
I won't tell if you won't.

07:58.011 --> 08:01.079
Well, it's an elaborate plan,
but it just might work.

08:01.081 --> 08:04.082
And I hope this won't
affect our relationship

08:04.084 --> 08:06.818
When you end up
on the losing side
and I'm on the winning side,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.620
Because that's
how it's gonna be.
You know why?

08:08.622 --> 08:10.188
Because they flipped
the definition

08:10.190 --> 08:11.756
Of losing and winning
in the dictionary?

08:13.125 --> 08:15.560
By the way, there's no
comeback to that.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.696
No, because you're
too emotional.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.931
You wear all your feelings
on your sleeve.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.833
The best expert witnesses

08:21.835 --> 08:24.202
Are always cool
and dispassionate.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.839
The ones who are easily
rattled on the stand

08:27.841 --> 08:30.141
Have their credibility
completely undermined.

08:30.143 --> 08:33.645
See?
See, this is where you and I
are completely different.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.114
I certainly
don't want you to win,
but I don't wish you ill.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.551
I would never do anything
to try to intimidate you

08:39.553 --> 08:42.053
Or undermine
your confidence or even--

08:49.095 --> 08:52.631
Oh, look, my cupcake's
the biggest again.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.067
And it's getting worse.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.869
She didn't want
to leave the den.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.139
So I turned on the wrestling.
Well, she liked it.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.208
So I changed over
to football.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.709
She liked that.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.778
Maybe it's that
I have to pee,

09:06.780 --> 09:08.780
But it seems like
you've been talking forever.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.151
- Is charlie around?
- He's just brewing up
some coffee.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.987
He asked me to paint
my feelings,

09:15.989 --> 09:18.657
And, boy, did I.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.559
Can't wait to show him.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.827
Do you want to see it?

09:22.829 --> 09:25.730
Desperately.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.999
It's multimedia art,

09:28.001 --> 09:29.801
Which I'm told is a thing.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.042
I call it "the way
I feel inside,"

09:37.044 --> 09:40.178
Parentheses,
"(not good)."

09:40.180 --> 09:42.714
Well, you know,
this is one of those things

09:42.716 --> 09:46.051
Where either you love it
or you're sane.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.820
I was gonna give it
to lacey as a gift.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.623
I want her to see
the real me.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.091
You know what, nolan?

09:53.093 --> 09:56.227
That is the best idea
I've heard in my entire life.

09:58.364 --> 10:02.167
Hey, lacey,
I have a gift for you.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.603
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.272
Please be shoes.
Please be shoes.
Please be shoes.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.841
Oh, my god!

10:11.043 --> 10:14.179
You know what?
It's perfect.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.982
I know just where
to hang it.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.153
I always figured you'd end up
hanging in lacey's house,

10:22.155 --> 10:25.123
But I just assumed
it would be from a pipe
in her garage.

10:26.726 --> 10:30.128
It's called compression
men's underwear.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.997
Hey, look at
these underwear.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.132
They make your ass
look good in your jeans.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.667
Yeah.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.268
Hey, guys.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.305
- What are you looking at?
- Porn.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.908
Mostly asian shy girls.
Why?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.744
What, are you writing
a book about it?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.078
What is all this stuff?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.047
Case files.
I need to review them

10:49.049 --> 10:51.750
Because I am
an expert witness.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.752
( laughs )
good luck.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.321
I've watched
many, many hours
of "law & order,"

10:56.323 --> 10:59.257
"svu," "criminal intent,"
"trial by jury,"

10:59.259 --> 11:02.394
And I've seen what a tough da
can do to an expert witness.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.396
They hammer at them,
twist their words.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.331
And these are respected
character actors.

11:07.233 --> 11:10.135
They are gonna have
a field day with you,

11:10.137 --> 11:11.202
My angry friend.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.238
They're gonna get you
so worked up

11:13.240 --> 11:15.340
And stressed out, you're gonna
think you're the guy on trial.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.043
That's just what kate said.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.278
You know what?
I need to rehearse
so I can get used to it.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.681
Okay, I want you
to try to get me mad.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.382
All right.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.685
Where were you on the night
of April 14?

11:26.687 --> 11:29.387
I know where I was.
Doing your mother.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.358
- Dude, uncool.
- What if they pull
that in court?

11:33.360 --> 11:36.361
They're not gonna talk
about banging my mother
in court.

11:36.363 --> 11:40.098
I don't know.
Is the case about whores?

11:40.100 --> 11:42.067
Okay, that's your
last warning.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.135
Excuse me, counselor.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.104
I'll take the witness.

11:46.106 --> 11:50.208
They always
call him the witness.
It dehumanizes them.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.177
I own this bitch.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.212
Ahem.

11:54.214 --> 11:58.049
Isn't it true that you give
your ex-wife spousal support?

11:58.051 --> 12:00.251
Yes, I do.
Plenty.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.320
Judging by your response,
I'd say that money

12:02.322 --> 12:04.322
Is an issue
in your relationship.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.258
Do you remember
giving me $700 cash

12:07.260 --> 12:11.129
For a dental bill
for your daughter
samantha goodson?

12:11.131 --> 12:13.064
What did you do, jen?

12:13.066 --> 12:17.068
Do you remember denying
your ex-wife a similar
amount of money,

12:17.070 --> 12:20.305
Saying she didn't need
to go see the allman brothers
in louisiana?

12:20.307 --> 12:22.440
Jen, why do you do
this stupid crap?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.242
This is why
you're always broke.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.844
And I hope the allman
brothers like you

12:25.846 --> 12:27.479
Because you're gonna
be sleeping in their van.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.848
And another thing, this--

12:29.850 --> 12:32.317
This is my laundry basket.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.853
49 seconds.
And it's not a van.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.521
It's a bus
and it's very comfortable.

12:36.523 --> 12:40.291
Oh, man, I didn't even
make it through a whole minute.

12:40.293 --> 12:43.795
And those were your shirts.
I did 'em when I washed
sam's stuff.

12:44.530 --> 12:45.964
Bad news, dad.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.866
The cash-only dentist
says I need more work.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.234
Can I have 300 bucks?

12:49.236 --> 12:50.935
Too late, honey.
He already knows.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.138
Well, then can I at least
go to the dentist?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.809
So, in order to understand
why we get angry,

12:57.811 --> 13:00.912
We all have to be willing
to admit our fears to each
other in this room.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.514
I'll give you an example.

13:02.516 --> 13:04.983
I'm a bit nervous
about testifying at
a trial tomorrow.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.485
Are you a snitch?
'cause if you are,

13:07.487 --> 13:09.854
You should be afraid
right now.

13:11.490 --> 13:14.359
No, I was hired
as an expert witness
for the defense.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.295
Oh, one of the guys
that lies for us.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.230
- Sweet.
- He's a liar.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.999
I love that.
Lie your ass off.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.201
No, no, no.
I don't have to lie.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.171
The case is about a guy who,
in a sudden fit of rage,

13:26.173 --> 13:27.505
Tore someone's
prosthetic arm off

13:27.507 --> 13:30.175
And beat him
into a coma with it.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.178
I'm really just there
to say that the guy couldn't
control his anger.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.447
But I'm worried
that I may lose my temper
under cross-examination.

13:36.449 --> 13:40.418
Ooh, put a quarter
between your butt cheeks.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.921
Say what now?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.823
A quarter.
It'll distract you.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.025
You'll be so focused on
keeping the quarter there,

13:47.027 --> 13:49.828
It'll take your mind off
your anger during the trial.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.896
Oh, please.

13:51.898 --> 13:54.265
That's your solution
for everything.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.535
You got a quarter
in your ass right now.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.605
Ain't no trial
going on.

14:02.274 --> 14:03.975
No, it really works.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.944
Help you pass
the lie detector test, too.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.446
I'll tell you this,
if it weren't for the quarter,

14:08.448 --> 14:11.616
I'd have a lot more
consecutive life terms.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.518
Ooh, and you don't
put it inside.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.087
You just hold it there
between the cheeks.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.523
You don't put it
inside the slot

14:18.525 --> 14:20.525
Unless you're giving
pony rides.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.328
While I appreciate
the advice,

14:23.330 --> 14:25.363
I think I'll explore
some less radical alternatives.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.099
All I'm saying is
heads and tails never fails.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.401
And a silver dollar
will make you holler.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.639
As the author
of numerous studies

14:34.641 --> 14:37.308
On the subject
of behavioral psychology,

14:37.310 --> 14:40.078
I can categorically state

14:40.080 --> 14:42.547
That this was not
spontaneous rage.

14:42.549 --> 14:46.217
It was a brutal,
premeditated attack.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.487
No further questions,
dr. Wales.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.390
I'd like to call to
the stand the expert witness
for the defense,

14:52.392 --> 14:56.261
Charles goodson,
for cross-examination.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.163
That's the prosecution, baby.
They're gonna eat you alive.

15:00.299 --> 15:02.500
Trust me, I'm money.

15:13.178 --> 15:17.048
I'd like to remind the witness
that he's still under oath.

15:17.050 --> 15:20.251
<i>Now, yesterday, mr. Goodson,</i>
<i>you asked the jury</i>

15:20.253 --> 15:23.087
To believe that a man
could in a split second

15:23.089 --> 15:26.524
Fly into a red-hot rage,
remove a prosthetic arm,

15:26.526 --> 15:29.627
And then use it
to violently beat someone

15:29.629 --> 15:32.530
Who is literally
at that moment unarmed.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.198
Yes, I did.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.700
Now, you realize,
kate wales,

15:35.702 --> 15:37.635
An established
social scientist,

15:37.637 --> 15:40.138
<i>Papers published</i>
<i>in four languages,</i>

15:40.140 --> 15:42.941
A member of the apa,
the cbbs,

15:42.943 --> 15:45.176
And the nasw,
disagrees with you.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.679
Are you a member of any
of these organizations?

15:47.681 --> 15:50.014
Maybe.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.617
What does cbbs stand for?

15:52.619 --> 15:56.187
I'll take that as a no.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.456
Isn't it true,
mr. Goodson,

15:58.458 --> 16:03.661
After destroying
your professional baseball
career in a fit of rage?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.697
- Well, not exactly.
- Not exactly?

16:05.699 --> 16:07.966
You broke a bat
over your own knee.

16:07.968 --> 16:12.003
And after that, like a lot
of other washed-up athletes,

16:12.005 --> 16:14.105
You thought, "what am I
gonna do for a living?"

16:14.107 --> 16:17.141
- Can I talk for a second?
- And instead of opening
a car dealership

16:17.143 --> 16:19.577
Or a sports bar
fronting a cocaine operation,

16:19.579 --> 16:22.981
You decided,
"I'm gonna be
an anger therapist."

16:22.983 --> 16:24.749
Hey, you want to object
or something?

16:24.751 --> 16:26.684
Prosecutor:
<i>Just talk to me</i>
<i>right here, mr. Goodson.</i>

16:26.686 --> 16:28.720
Please don't speak to her.
She's not going to help.

16:28.722 --> 16:31.756
I don't need any help.
I am a qualified
anger therapist.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.058
<i>Oh, well, that's obvious,</i>
<i>mr. Goodson.</i>

16:34.060 --> 16:35.660
You're certainly
not a dumb jock

16:35.662 --> 16:38.062
Who's out of his league
in this courtroom.

16:38.064 --> 16:41.666
I'm enough of a dumb jock
to kick your ass!

16:44.603 --> 16:48.406
And if the prosecutor
had an artificial limb,

16:48.408 --> 16:50.475
I would certainly have
wrenched it from its socket

16:50.477 --> 16:52.310
And beat him with it.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.479
That is a crime of passion.

16:54.481 --> 16:57.181
Only in such a rage
could the defendant,

16:57.183 --> 16:59.183
<i>Now reduced to the instincts</i>
<i>of a nine-year-old,</i>

16:59.185 --> 17:01.319
Beat his victim
with his own arm

17:01.321 --> 17:03.121
While yelling,

17:03.123 --> 17:06.424
"why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?"

17:06.426 --> 17:08.493
Your honor, the witness
is out of control.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.728
Objection.
I think my witness
is in control,

17:10.730 --> 17:13.097
- And that's the point.
- Sustained.

17:13.099 --> 17:16.267
Your honor,
I call a mistrial.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.703
Excuse me?

17:18.705 --> 17:21.039
Charlie goodson and I
are sleeping together.

17:21.041 --> 17:24.075
( crowd gasps, murmurs )

17:24.077 --> 17:26.778
<i>( quarter clatters )</i>

17:29.648 --> 17:31.349
I've been having
a really good day.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.685
Fun little case.
Guy gets beat up
with a fake arm.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.188
Nice break
from the coke dealers

17:37.190 --> 17:38.689
And the gang slayings.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.826
Now I've got to stop
everything for you guys.

17:44.196 --> 17:45.630
So what's going on here?

17:45.632 --> 17:48.566
Because if you are involved,

17:48.568 --> 17:51.602
I'm gonna have to throw out
your testimony.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.404
Are you in a relationship?

17:53.406 --> 17:54.672
No, sir.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.441
This woman will
tell you unequivocally

17:56.443 --> 17:57.775
That we are not
in a relationship.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.177
Isn't that right,
dr. Wales?

17:59.179 --> 18:01.212
Didn't you just
stand up in my court

18:01.214 --> 18:03.648
And say you two
were having sex?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.850
Well, it's a fine point,
your honor.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.119
What we have
is a highly unusual
arrangement.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.654
<i>You might find</i>
<i>this interesting.</i>

18:09.656 --> 18:12.690
What we have
is a noncommittal,

18:12.692 --> 18:16.694
Nonemotional,
purely physical situation.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.363
I don't find it
interesting.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.432
All I'm trying to find out

18:21.434 --> 18:24.402
Is whether you two
share information.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.636
She won't share
anything with me.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.572
I hardly know
the woman's birthday.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.707
Hold on.
Tell me,

18:29.709 --> 18:32.710
Do you get together
every Saturday night?

18:32.712 --> 18:36.147
- Sure.
- Order in italian sometimes?

18:36.149 --> 18:38.649
- Yeah.
- Get in your share
of fights?

18:38.651 --> 18:40.151
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.653
What you got there
is a relationship.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.855
Yes!

18:43.857 --> 18:47.325
- You're both dismissed.
- Damn it!

18:51.296 --> 18:53.364
You know, I think I did
a pretty good job up there.

18:53.366 --> 18:56.234
I hope this won't affect
our working relationship
in the future.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.736
- I'll call you.
- Got it.

19:01.373 --> 19:04.308
Hey, ed.
Before we start,

19:04.310 --> 19:05.710
How's everything
going with the den?

19:05.712 --> 19:08.746
Great.
Wife hasn't bothered
me in several days.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.716
I put something
terrifying in there.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.819
What, like a ghost shark?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.754
The only thing scarier
than a ghost or a shark

19:16.756 --> 19:18.422
Is a ghost shark.

19:20.392 --> 19:24.262
Son, something up there
is broke real bad.

19:25.931 --> 19:28.833
No, I hung nolan's
painting on the wall.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.502
- But I gave that to lacey.
- And I sold it to ed

19:31.504 --> 19:33.771
- To get these.
- I knew it!

19:33.773 --> 19:37.241
Yup, best 500 bucks
I ever spent.

19:37.243 --> 19:40.511
Lacey, you need
to start considering
other people's feelings.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.547
Nolan gave you something that
was very meaningful to him

19:42.549 --> 19:44.515
And you just gave it away
like it was nothing.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.784
Oh, my god.
He's so right.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.419
I'm glad
I didn't think of that

19:48.421 --> 19:51.822
Because these shoes
look fantastic on me.

19:55.427 --> 19:56.961
Hey.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.463
Sorry, I'm about
to start a session.

19:59.465 --> 20:00.865
Way to cheat today.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.201
Cost me a career
as an expert witness.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.236
Hey, I suffer
just as much as you.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.871
I can't be an expert witness
anymore either.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.307
Hey, that was not
your big loss, dr. Wales.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.443
Besides having a judge rule
that we're in a relationship,
you lost your cool.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.312
Excuse me,
I did not.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.948
Yelling out like a little
baby in the courtroom?

20:16.950 --> 20:19.450
"I slept with mr. Goodson
and I loved it!"

20:19.452 --> 20:21.719
I did not say
I loved it.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.688
It's the least
you could have done.

20:24.957 --> 20:29.527
What I did was a brilliant
and calculated countermove.

20:29.529 --> 20:33.764
That you were the emotional
one and I was the better
expert witness?

20:33.766 --> 20:36.334
Okay, charlie, what can I do
to get you to drop this?

20:36.336 --> 20:37.902
I want you to say,

20:37.904 --> 20:40.805
"charlie, you were
the superior expert witness."

20:40.807 --> 20:43.941
Charlie, you were
the superior expert witness.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.843
"doctorates don't mean squat."

20:45.845 --> 20:48.980
Doctorates
don't mean squat.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.749
"I was undone
by my own hubris."

20:51.751 --> 20:54.518
Oh, my god,
you're an idiot.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.886
Okay.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.823
"I'm impressed charlie
knows the word hubris."

20:58.825 --> 21:00.825
Well, that part's true.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.761
"and even though I may be
a needy, emotional wreck

21:03.763 --> 21:06.697
- And a hopeless romantic--"
- don't push your luck, goodson.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.866
Oh, by the way.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.669
This quarter dropped out
of your pocket in the courtroom.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.039
You keep it.
