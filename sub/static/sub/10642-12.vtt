30:02.481 --> 30:05.616
But you want it anyway.

30:05.684 --> 30:07.451
Chocolate.

30:07.520 --> 30:08.786
Whiskey.

30:08.854 --> 30:13.290
Yeah, but taking a kid is not
like eating a Hershey bar.

30:13.359 --> 30:15.325
You've never had an urge?

30:15.394 --> 30:17.361
Not like that, no.

30:19.198 --> 30:20.164
What about her?

30:20.232 --> 30:22.099
- What?
- The detective.

30:22.168 --> 30:24.001
You shouldn't have done
that, but you did it.

30:24.069 --> 30:25.769
Are you trying to compare me to...

30:25.838 --> 30:28.472
I'm just talking about
wanting what we shouldn't want.

30:28.541 --> 30:30.007
- Well, that's different.
- Why?

30:30.075 --> 30:32.509
She's a consenting adult.

30:32.578 --> 30:34.077
Okay.

30:36.215 --> 30:37.975
Have you ever wanted to
have sex with a woman

30:38.017 --> 30:39.383
that didn't want to have sex with you?

30:39.452 --> 30:40.284
That's rape.

30:40.352 --> 30:41.185
Yes.

30:41.253 --> 30:42.219
- That's wrong.
- Yes.

30:42.288 --> 30:43.120
I'd never do it.

30:43.189 --> 30:44.354
Neither would I.

30:47.226 --> 30:49.560
Wanting it doesn't make you the monster.

30:49.628 --> 30:51.495
Taking it does.

31:00.005 --> 31:01.638
[Elevator bell dings]

31:03.676 --> 31:04.983
Hey.

31:07.046 --> 31:08.445
- Is the story on my desk?
- Mm-hmm.

31:08.514 --> 31:09.813
All the research, too, right?

31:09.882 --> 31:11.215
Everything I got.

31:13.118 --> 31:14.627
Good.

31:16.822 --> 31:18.288
- Gus.
- Yeah.

31:18.357 --> 31:21.391
You should have given
me a byline sooner.

31:21.460 --> 31:22.860
[Elevator bell dings]

31:42.648 --> 31:43.580
Mom.

31:46.785 --> 31:48.919
Claire: Oh.

31:56.495 --> 31:58.662
What are you doing?!

31:58.731 --> 32:00.597
Trying to hitch a ride.

32:00.666 --> 32:02.733
Do you know how dangerous that is?

32:04.336 --> 32:05.435
Yeah.

32:13.212 --> 32:14.845
Come home.

32:17.483 --> 32:18.982
Okay.

32:24.490 --> 32:26.023
Wait.

32:26.091 --> 32:28.025
What?

32:28.093 --> 32:30.060
I did something.

32:31.964 --> 32:33.297
[Indistinct conversations]

32:41.273 --> 32:42.372
Two more, please.

32:53.852 --> 32:54.885
Um, again.

32:54.954 --> 32:58.288
This time, something
that takes mixing.

33:01.660 --> 33:03.961
You were right.

33:07.866 --> 33:09.066
I was going to tell you.

33:14.173 --> 33:15.172
No, I wasn't.

33:20.713 --> 33:25.048
It brought you back home. There's that.

33:30.255 --> 33:32.456
Can you just give me a rope burn?

33:34.827 --> 33:37.227
When I broke your Optimus Prime,

33:37.296 --> 33:40.697
you gave me one that was red for days.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.468
You said, "Close your
eyes and roll up your sleeve."

33:44.536 --> 33:47.237
And... And I was so dumb

33:47.306 --> 33:49.506
I thought you were gonna give
me a sticker or something.

33:52.544 --> 33:54.745
But at least it made it okay again.

34:01.353 --> 34:03.053
I love you.

34:08.994 --> 34:11.428
Close your eyes.

34:38.157 --> 34:40.023
Nina: Sorry to call you in so late.

34:41.893 --> 34:44.795
I have to give an
acceptance speech in the morning.

34:44.862 --> 34:48.965
I think I found your son.

34:49.034 --> 34:51.268
I... I'm sorry.

34:51.335 --> 34:54.404
We found human remains in
the suspect's backyard.

34:54.473 --> 34:57.107
All Forensics has got is that
it's an adolescent male.

34:59.945 --> 35:03.013
I'm gonna put him in a hole, Claire.

35:03.082 --> 35:05.015
For what he did to both of them.

35:05.084 --> 35:08.151
He should rot in a cage

35:08.220 --> 35:11.421
smaller than the one he locked them in.

35:11.490 --> 35:12.789
That's what he deserves,

35:12.858 --> 35:15.826
and I'm asking you to help me do it.

35:18.797 --> 35:20.831
What do you need?

35:20.899 --> 35:23.400
Your DNA to confirm it's Adam.

35:23.469 --> 35:24.534
[Sighs]

35:24.603 --> 35:26.503
It's the only way that you can get him?

35:26.572 --> 35:27.738
It's all I have left.

35:27.806 --> 35:29.072
- This will go public.
- Yes.

35:29.141 --> 35:30.807
I just won an election.

35:30.876 --> 35:31.641
Yes.

35:38.016 --> 35:42.385
Is there enough of my son left to bury?

35:42.454 --> 35:43.754
Yes.

35:56.535 --> 35:58.101
Do it.

36:02.598 --> 36:04.319
You ready?

36:04.388 --> 36:06.421
I just ran for Governor, right?

36:06.490 --> 36:09.391
And governors run for President.

36:09.459 --> 36:12.661
[Camera shutters
clicking, indistinct shouting]

36:29.079 --> 36:30.679
Good morning.

36:32.549 --> 36:36.351
I would like to thank
you all for coming,

36:36.420 --> 36:38.320
um...

36:38.388 --> 36:41.456
Governor Lang for his
gracious words last night,

36:41.525 --> 36:46.227
and all the voters who
came out on a very cold day

36:46.296 --> 36:50.432
and participated in
the political process.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.500
Um...

36:52.569 --> 36:59.174
I would not be here
without the support of my family.

36:59.242 --> 37:02.711
And it is for them that
I want to make our state

37:02.779 --> 37:07.182
a better place, a safer place.

37:10.354 --> 37:14.789
Because we all have the right

37:14.858 --> 37:18.693
to feel secure in our own neighborhoods.

37:18.762 --> 37:21.896
We deserve a world in which we can

37:21.965 --> 37:25.967
send our children off to
the bus stop in the morning

37:26.036 --> 37:29.971
without having to
worry they won't come back.

37:30.040 --> 37:34.376
That is my commitment
to the people of Maine.

37:34.444 --> 37:38.680
Here today, I will
make that world a reality.

37:43.620 --> 37:48.490
But great change doesn't
come without great sacrifice,

37:48.558 --> 37:52.060
and believe me,

37:52.129 --> 37:55.296
we know that better than anyone.

37:56.633 --> 37:58.566
The next four years won't be easy.

37:58.635 --> 38:00.034
Nothing important ever is,

38:00.103 --> 38:04.739
but I am ready to roll up my sleeves

38:04.808 --> 38:07.475
and do whatever it
takes for the brighter future

38:07.544 --> 38:09.778
that we all deserve.

38:09.846 --> 38:12.180
No matter what stands in my way,

38:12.249 --> 38:15.750
I will never stop fighting for you,

38:15.819 --> 38:19.220
for your families, and
for your children.

38:19.289 --> 38:22.957
I am so honored to be the next Governor

38:23.026 --> 38:25.894
of the great state of Maine.

38:27.197 --> 38:29.697
[Applause]

38:33.437 --> 38:34.936
[Sighs]

38:38.375 --> 38:39.541
It's not him.

38:39.609 --> 38:40.875
What?

38:40.944 --> 38:42.343
Forensics came back on the bones.

38:42.412 --> 38:43.545
It's some other kid.

38:43.613 --> 38:46.981
He was killed before
Warren was even taken.

38:49.386 --> 38:51.986
Then what happened to Adam?

38:53.490 --> 38:55.690
[Baby crying]

39:01.998 --> 39:05.233
[Crying continues]

39:08.305 --> 39:10.939
Is there a bottle back there?

39:14.611 --> 39:18.613
[Crying continues]

39:18.682 --> 39:20.415
I'm gonna run inside.

39:44.574 --> 39:46.441
Man: Help you with something?

39:46.510 --> 39:48.610
Do you have a phone?

39:48.678 --> 39:51.112
Over there.

39:53.617 --> 39:57.252
<i>Ben: Picture your life.</i>

39:57.320 --> 39:59.354
<i>I've lived two of them.</i>

39:59.422 --> 40:00.889
Did you even try it?

40:00.957 --> 40:02.924
The Governor-Elect doesn't
have time to taste all the food.

40:02.993 --> 40:06.661
Well, she should, because
it came from the pet aisle.

40:06.730 --> 40:09.197
[Laughter, telephone rings]

40:09.266 --> 40:11.699
<i>Every moment precious.</i>

40:11.768 --> 40:12.901
Claire: Someone get that?

40:14.437 --> 40:16.237
It's the press.

40:16.306 --> 40:19.173
Lang's concession speech isn't bad.

40:19.242 --> 40:21.709
Come on. My hands are wet.

40:21.778 --> 40:23.611
Let the machine get it.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.980
Oh, now it's bad. Listen to this.

40:26.049 --> 40:30.552
He says, "It has been an
honor serving the people of Maine,

40:30.620 --> 40:34.289
and I look forward to doing
it again in the future."

40:34.357 --> 40:35.723
It's just so blatant.

40:35.792 --> 40:37.225
I didn't think he'd
be this disrespectful.

40:37.294 --> 40:38.626
Hello?

40:44.000 --> 40:47.602
[Pounding]

40:58.114 --> 40:59.447
We have to go right now.

41:02.052 --> 41:04.118
There's something I need to do first.

41:12.062 --> 41:15.964
You took my life.

41:16.032 --> 41:17.722
I'm coming to get it back.
