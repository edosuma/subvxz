01:54.740 --> 01:56.433
- Evenin', doc.
- Hello, Rimfire.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.018
Doesn't the navy ever
run out of potatoes?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.911
This ship sure don't.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.951
- Evenin', Doctor.
- Ellis. Johnny. Hot below.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.453
Sure is. I'm gonna sleep
topside tonight.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.915
Not for long. We're getting
the tail end of a storm in the midwatch.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.835
A man can't plan much ahead
at all, can he?

02:22.935 --> 02:24.310
Not much.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.399
All right, break it up.
Make room for a workin' sailor.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.136
Just keep workin', man.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.695
You're lucky you don't get it
on your heads.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.537
Come and get it, you hungry buzzards.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.291
Here's another one.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.090
Who's got a light?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.593
Those sharks.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.831
- Ain't they nasty things?
- They're just fish.

03:00.931 --> 03:05.252
Corky, what do you think of the captain
they sent to take old Pinky's place?

03:05.352 --> 03:07.045
I ain't supposed to think.

03:07.145 --> 03:11.175
You know somethin'? He ain't left
his cabin since we left Trinidad.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.344
What's he doing?
Playing acey-deucy by himself?

03:14.444 --> 03:17.222
I'll tell you what he's doin'.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.933
He's seasick!
That's what the navy's comin' to.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.228
Seasick feather merchants
takin' the place of regular navy.

03:23.328 --> 03:28.567
Man, I just hope this guy knows
port from starboard, that's all.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.320
You know what I'd do if I was you,
Robbins?

03:31.420 --> 03:35.131
I'd just put in for the skipper's job
if I was you.

03:39.261 --> 03:42.138
All right. Did you have your laugh?

03:43.390 --> 03:45.474
Well, now I'm gonna tell you somethin'.

03:45.601 --> 03:48.045
The guy who walks that bridge
has got your neck in his hands,

03:48.145 --> 03:50.980
and don't you forget it.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.591
Thanks, Salvador.

04:19.343 --> 04:22.329
- You've got us down 200, partner.
- Sorry, sir.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.957
- Six spades.
- I thought I could do it, sir.

04:25.057 --> 04:28.726
- Well, don't go off half-cocked again.
- No, sir.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.797
- Any sign of the weather, doc?
- Filling up in the east.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.857
Jolly, jolly. And I've got the watch.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.515
- I pass.
- What? Haven't you got anything?

04:41.615 --> 04:45.102
- Why don't you just look at his hand?
- Well, I have to help him along.

04:45.202 --> 04:49.648
- I suppose I could try a heart, sir.
- He supposes he could try a heart, sir.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.609
- Two clubs.
- Captain Murrell still holed up, doc?

04:52.709 --> 04:54.820
- Far as I know.
- Three diamonds.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.656
They might have sent us
a captain who had his sea legs.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.882
I guess they do the best they can.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.122
I don't see why they didn't move Ware up,
He's been exec long enough.

05:05.222 --> 05:09.626
Mackeson, the only craft I ever commanded
was a yawl in the Miami yacht races.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.045
The nearest I ever came to winning
was 29th.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.423
The navy was desperate enough
to take me,

05:14.523 --> 05:17.467
but not foolish enough
to let me sail away by myself.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.887
- Beats me how I ever got this far.
- Money.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.780
- I know you're rich.
- Don't be bitter, grandpa.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.949
Your bid, Mackeson.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.744
- Four spades.
- I'm not bitter. I just wanna go home.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.441
When I've bought a ranch in Nevada,
I never expect to see water again.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.583
- Ensign Merry?
- Sir?

05:34.710 --> 05:36.752
Your bid.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.549
- Careful.
- Yes, sir. I'm thinking about it.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.204
- Your mouth's open, Ensign.
- Sir?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.332
- Are you gonna bid?
- Six diamonds.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.392
- Six diamonds?
- I'm just backing you up, sir.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.046
You are deliberately
distracting my partner.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.506
Pass and double.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.442
All right, Mr. Merry. Dummy.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.739
This Murrell seems like
a cold sort of a fish.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.852
Captain Murrell oughtn't to be here at all.
He's as weak as a kitten.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.687
A man who gets his ship torpedoed

06:10.787 --> 06:13.482
and spends 25 days on a raft
in the North Atlantic

06:13.582 --> 06:17.277
oughtn't to have to hit the ball again
with only a few weeks in the hospital.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.614
I guess there aren't enough
commanding officers to go around.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.325
Well, at least they gave him
an easy ship.

06:23.425 --> 06:27.371
Boy, easy's no word for it.
Listen, he'll get more rest on this boat...

06:27.471 --> 06:29.706
- Ship.
- Ship, boat. What's the difference?

06:29.806 --> 06:33.085
He'll still get more rest here
than he would if he were in a feather bed.

06:33.185 --> 06:36.254
Now, me, I'd like something
to happen once in a while.

06:36.354 --> 06:40.858
If the navy ever gets a load of this crew
in battle, they'll send us back to boot camp.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.261
I'll look ridiculous
with my head shaved.

06:43.361 --> 06:48.308
Kid, couldn't you have indicated clubs?
Then I could have gone to no-trump.

06:48.408 --> 06:52.062
We are going down again. And doubled.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.246
Sorry, sir.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.083
All right.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.737
- Your lead, Mackeson.
- Now hear this.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.573
Lay before the mast
all eight o'clock reports.

07:03.673 --> 07:07.593
Darken ship. The smoking lamp
is out on all weather decks.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.463
We'll slow her down a little.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.897
All engines ahead two-thirds.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.168
Bridge, Radar. I've got a spook.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.988
- Radar contact, Mr. Ware.
- What?

08:25.088 --> 08:27.214
- Radar contact.
- Good heavens.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.828
- Bridge, aye?
- Definite spook, sir.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.499
- Strong enough to plot?
- Range: 12,000 off the starboard bow.

08:35.599 --> 08:38.668
- Get on the plot, Mackeson.
- Captain, aye.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.254
Radar reports a contact
off starboard bow, sir.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.715
- Run a plot on it.
- Plot's working, sir.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.817
- Then head for the target.
- Aye aye, sir.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.429
- Zigzag, sir?
- What would you say, mister?

08:49.529 --> 08:54.226
Me? Well, negative zigzag, sir.
Give the plot a chance to steady on.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.410
That's right, mister.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.172
- Give me that again, Radar.
- Did you get it?

09:09.132 --> 09:12.702
Estimated target's course 140,

09:12.802 --> 09:18.333
speed ten knots, bearing 124 true.

09:18.433 --> 09:22.978
Bring her around to 124.
All engines ahead flank.

09:28.610 --> 09:32.613
- Can't seem to make up his mind.
- Maybe he wants to see if I'm awake.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.464
- What's the rush?
- I don't know, but we're sure juicin' it up.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.159
What's the word?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.244
Radar's got somethin'.
We're going after it.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.955
- What's up?
- He says they got a bogey.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.265
Hurry. Come on, wake up.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.518
- We're going after it.
- You don't wanna miss it.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.382
Gangway.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.900
Gangway, please.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.679
I was here first. Gangway yourself.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.765
Excuse me, sir.
Break it up. Let the captain in.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.476
- What's all the crowd about, sailor?
- Well, sir,

10:18.576 --> 10:21.813
I guess we don't get much excitement
aboard this ship.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.357
- Keep your seat. What's your name?
- Andrews, sir.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.027
- What do you make of it?
- I don't know, Captain.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.238
- Our speed's rattling the set.
- Guess. You're the operator.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.199
It's doing ten knots.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.467
It's got some power, but it's
too small a spook to be a heavy vessel.

10:35.593 --> 10:40.889
It might be a fishing smack, or it
might be the conning tower of a sub, sir.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.129
- Bridge. Lieutenant Ware.
- Mr. Ware.

10:46.229 --> 10:49.216
We're about to lose radar contact
at the rate we're going.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.385
Reduce speed to speed of target
and get on its tail.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.597
At this distance,
we'll make visual contact at daybreak.

10:55.697 --> 10:59.226
- Shall I shake the ship out for a standby?
- Not much shaking out to be done.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.437
But ready underwater search gear.
If this spook is a U-boat,

11:02.537 --> 11:06.233
he might pull the plug,
and we'll have to go after him.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.194
- Who's the senior radarman, Andrews?
- That's me, sir.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.862
You track the target.

11:10.962 --> 11:14.923
Any turn or change in speed,
no matter how small, don't miss it.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.135
I'll stick on him,
don't you worry, Captain.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.330
All right, I won't.

11:20.430 --> 11:24.683
If anybody's gonna be caught
with his pants down, it oughtn't to be us.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.380
Seems like he knows his business, to me.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.815
Feather merchant,
that's all I got to say.

11:48.666 --> 11:52.586
Signal is to stern,
Herr Kapitän. 8,000 meters.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.798
It's either a ship or a false echo.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.218
You've lost it.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.205
It comes and goes.

12:02.305 --> 12:05.974
The sea return makes it difficult
to keep the image.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.395
There, Kapitän. There it comes.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.823
Port 20 degrees, Schwaffer.

12:37.257 --> 12:42.245
- Target's course changing to port.
- Target's turning left, Captain.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.372
25... 20 degrees.

12:44.472 --> 12:48.851
Maintain your present speed.
Steady as you go.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.894
May I ask what your procedure is, sir?

12:51.104 --> 12:54.106
If this is an enemy ship,
our signal may be on his oscillator

12:54.232 --> 12:55.592
and he's trying to feel us out -

12:55.692 --> 12:58.386
make a couple of turns,
see if we change position.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.306
If we can hold
an unchanging position behind him,

13:01.406 --> 13:04.283
he may mistake us
for a ghost echo on these heavy seas.

13:06.536 --> 13:11.331
- The signal does not change, Herr Kapitän.
- Starboard 40 degrees.

13:18.465 --> 13:23.552
- Target's turning sharp starboard, sir.
- Can you estimate the degree, Andrews?

13:25.138 --> 13:29.850
- 40... 45 degrees, Captain.
- All engines stop.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.381
You think it might be a U-boat, sir?

13:34.481 --> 13:37.566
Wiggling like one. He may take the bait.

13:37.692 --> 13:40.903
- If he doesn't, he'll crash-dive.
- Excuse me, sir.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.409
It holds the same place, Herr Kapitän.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.580
Resume course 140.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.130
Yes?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.759
He's on the hook.
He's come back into course 140.

14:03.885 --> 14:09.389
- All engines ahead two-thirds, steer 140.
- Aye aye, sir.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.502
Good, Andrews. The target won't
be satisfied with one check.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.421
Look for him to make a turn.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.105
Or he may slow down
or speed up. Thank you.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.844
- Sir?
- Well?

14:20.944 --> 14:24.722
- Do you wanna send a dispatch, sir?
- Why? Are you anxious to take one?

14:24.822 --> 14:28.617
- No, sir. I just thought...
- We have to keep radio silence tonight.

14:28.743 --> 14:32.689
We might tip our hand to the target.
But I'll get one out in the morning, OK?

14:32.789 --> 14:34.957
Yes, sir.

14:37.627 --> 14:41.922
This is the captain. I guess you're all
waiting for some kind of word.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.466
We're tracking an unidentified ship.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.636
We're going to try to stay
on his tail until morning.

14:48.596 --> 14:53.475
We will breakfast early,
and go to battle stations at 0530.

14:54.143 --> 14:58.631
Don't be surprised if we tangle
with a pig-boat a little after dawn.

14:58.731 --> 15:04.152
Do your jobs efficiently and we'll
chalk one up for the Haynes. That's all.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.906
I reckon we'll just drop an egg
right down his periscope.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.268
That'll be the end
of one more Nazi, huh?

15:10.368 --> 15:15.023
Or he'll just pop a fish right in our guts,
and that'll be the end of this tin can.

15:15.123 --> 15:19.068
- Man, a sub ain't no match for us.
- They ain't?

15:19.168 --> 15:22.238
Then how come they hunt U-boats
with three destroyers

15:22.338 --> 15:24.908
workin' together
up in the North Atlantic?

15:25.008 --> 15:27.009
Yeah. How come?

15:27.176 --> 15:29.261
Your bet.

15:31.848 --> 15:35.585
- Whose watch is next?
- Lieutenant Kunz, Herr Kapitän.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.769
Have him come here.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.443
Lieutenant Kunz, report forward.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.533
You wanted me, Herr Kapitän?

15:52.118 --> 15:54.411
Ja, Kunz.
Yours is the next watch on topside.

15:54.537 --> 15:58.373
We have a signal on the FMB.
I think it's a false echo.

15:58.499 --> 16:02.529
But to check its reaction, you will
zigzag twice an hour until daybreak.

16:02.629 --> 16:07.049
If it moves in closer,
you will awaken me immediately.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.645
Schwaffer.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.738
Come in, Heini.

16:31.366 --> 16:35.952
That Kunz annoys me.
Remind him that we do not salute at sea.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.456
He is new, Herr Kapitän.
He will tire of it.

16:39.582 --> 16:44.028
He is new?
Like our new Germany. A machine.

16:44.128 --> 16:48.950
Herr Kapitän. You think we are wise
in risking that image to be a false echo?

16:49.050 --> 16:51.953
Wise? Expedient.
Time is important, Heini,

16:52.053 --> 16:54.539
and we would travel
too slowly underwater.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.542
In 48 hours, we rendezvous
with Raider M.

16:57.642 --> 17:02.046
We take the captured British code book
and we go home with it.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.648
And this is the important thing.
Not the code book,

17:05.775 --> 17:09.236
but because, when we have it,
we can go home.

17:14.659 --> 17:17.911
Tastes like oil and bilge
and green mold.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.122
Sit down, Heini.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.463
Tastes like a U-boat.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.367
I've been in the U-boats
too long, Heini.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.203
There was a time when
I went to sea with a fresh heart.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.388
That was many years ago.

17:37.348 --> 17:40.350
Now I can only think of going home.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.562
- You want more?
- No more, Herr Kapitän.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.983
You think I take too much?

17:48.109 --> 17:50.470
Just enough to sleep.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.697
I cannot rest without it.
I think too much.

17:54.782 --> 17:58.660
Never think, Heini.
Be a good warrior and never think.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.608
You pay a penalty for thinking.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.834
You cannot rest.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.952
I taught these sons of mine
to be good warriors.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.680
Country. Duty. Ask no question.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.185
One is at the bottom of the sea,

18:24.395 --> 18:27.272
and this one is a cinder
in a burned airplane.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.234
And I'm glad.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.071
That's the way for warriors to die.
Young, and with faith.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.367
I have lived too long.

18:42.038 --> 18:45.874
- We are friends, Heini?
- I have been with you since I was a cadet.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.043
That's not what I asked you.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.116
I do not know.

18:53.216 --> 18:57.385
Sometimes I am afraid of you.
Many times I do not understand you.

18:58.596 --> 19:02.291
- I am not certain we are friends.
- We are friends. Believe that.

19:02.391 --> 19:06.645
We are friends. Because we are friends,
I'll tell you something.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.593
I am sick of this war.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.778
It's not a good war.

19:16.239 --> 19:18.891
You don't remember the first one.

19:18.991 --> 19:23.771
I was a Fähnrich in the U-boats.
And how proud I was!

19:23.871 --> 19:26.190
We went out
in those little sardine tins,

19:26.290 --> 19:30.585
and if we submerged, we couldn't
always be sure we'd come up again.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.990
It was a good game we played.

19:34.090 --> 19:37.326
The captain would look through
his periscope and sight a target,

19:37.426 --> 19:40.136
and then he did arithmetic in his head

19:40.263 --> 19:42.848
and said "Torpedo los."

19:44.600 --> 19:49.062
And you know something? Sometimes
the torpedo wouldn't even leave the tube.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.358
And if it did, we were
most lucky to hit something.

19:54.652 --> 20:00.615
And now I look in the periscope and
it gives me the distance and the speed.

20:02.285 --> 20:05.021
I pass this information
to the attack table,

20:05.121 --> 20:09.692
and the machinery turns and
the lights flash, and we get the answer.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.918
The torpedo runs to its target,

20:12.670 --> 20:15.171
and there's no human error in this.

20:16.549 --> 20:20.787
They've taken human error
out of war, Heini.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.179
They've taken the human out of war.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.894
War was different then.

20:30.146 --> 20:33.132
It put iron in the country's backbone,

20:33.232 --> 20:35.676
gave them brave memory.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.320
And even in defeat, it gave them honor.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.156
There is no honor in this war.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.659
The memories will be ugly,
even if we win.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.038
And if we die,

20:49.248 --> 20:51.666
we die without God.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.461
You know that, Heini?

20:56.297 --> 20:59.341
I listen to what you say, Herr Kapitän.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.055
It's a bad war.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.684
Its reason is twisted.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.687
Its purpose is dark.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.943
It's not for a simple man.

22:00.611 --> 22:04.364
Lieutenant Crain is coming up, sir.
Port side.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.569
What's your best time
on reloading depth charges?

22:16.669 --> 22:19.655
It's not so hot, Captain.
Some of my boys are pretty green,

22:19.755 --> 22:22.950
but I'd say three minutes, or four.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.329
- Well, you've got to do better than that.
- I can try, sir.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.956
That's not good enough.
It might be the difference

22:29.056 --> 22:32.376
between stopping the enemy
and getting stopped ourselves.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.670
If that's the case, sir,
we'll be good enough.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.272
I'll depend on it.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.889
Mr. Ware? I'd like you
to stick with the plot

22:44.989 --> 22:47.141
in the pilot house
for the time being, please.

22:47.241 --> 22:49.284
Aye aye, sir.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.798
Looks like we've run out of the squall.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.202
Yeah.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.412
Why don't you lay
in your cabin for a while?

23:08.512 --> 23:10.414
I'm all right, Doctor.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.583
You getting the feel of a ship again?

23:12.683 --> 23:16.212
Either that, or that pig-boat
out there is strong medicine.

23:16.312 --> 23:19.355
I don't see how you can know
it's the enemy.

23:19.482 --> 23:22.317
Well, call it a sixth sense
if you want to.

23:23.069 --> 23:26.681
I always know when a mind is working
the other end of that radar beam.

23:26.781 --> 23:30.434
Interesting. I've heard
hunters say the same thing.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.853
They can sense the presence of game.

23:32.953 --> 23:36.857
In any case, this is going to be
a disappointed ship if it isn't the enemy.

23:36.957 --> 23:40.543
Yes, they all seem to be
a bloodthirsty crew.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.572
The men would like a chance
to do what they're here for.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.617
Not much other reason for existence.
Not now, anyway.

23:46.717 --> 23:49.704
No, I sometimes wonder
if there ever was another reason.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.872
I know what you mean.

23:51.972 --> 23:56.518
I had a baby clinic up in Ohio.
It was pretty important to me.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.421
Now it seems like something
that happened

23:58.521 --> 24:01.590
on another planet
and in another century.

24:01.690 --> 24:05.302
- What was your work, Captain?
- This. The sea.

24:05.402 --> 24:08.305
- You were a sailor?
- Third officer on a freighter

24:08.405 --> 24:11.699
out of Boston, to Liverpool,
Le Havre, and back again.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.936
Some of our crew will be glad
to know that.

24:14.036 --> 24:18.482
Our saltiest boys were complaining
mightily about getting a civilian skipper.

24:18.582 --> 24:22.361
- Feather merchant, I think they call it.
- Well, I am a feather merchant.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.255
- Well, yes, but not exactly.
- No, exactly.

24:26.048 --> 24:29.884
On the freighter, we were men against
the sea. Here, we're men against men.

24:30.010 --> 24:33.497
Like every other civilian in the war,
I had to learn a new way to think.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.459
Why did you change over to the navy?

24:36.559 --> 24:39.795
The freighter I was on
was cut in half by a torpedo.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.298
Thought I'd be
on the shooting end for a change.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.524
Captain.

24:45.901 --> 24:50.139
- Captain, aye?
- Target's increased speed to 13 knots, sir.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.850
Ring up a compensating speed, Mr. Ware.

24:52.950 --> 24:58.147
Aye aye, sir. All engines
ahead standard, 203 rpm, sir.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.373
Very well.

25:08.591 --> 25:12.161
Well, in time we'll all
get back to our own stuff again.

25:12.261 --> 25:15.263
The war'll get swallowed up
and seem like it never happened.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.958
Yes, but it won't be the same as it was.

25:18.058 --> 25:21.504
It won't have that feeling of permanency
that we had before.

25:21.604 --> 25:25.091
- We've learned a hard truth.
- How do you mean?

25:25.191 --> 25:28.094
That there's no end
to misery and destruction.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.554
You cut the head off a snake,
it grows another one.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.515
You cut that one off, you find another.

25:32.615 --> 25:35.184
We can't kill it because
it's within ourselves.

25:35.284 --> 25:39.605
You can call it the enemy if you want to,
but it's part of us. We're all men.

25:39.705 --> 25:44.193
I suppose there is some reason
to lose hope, but I reject it.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.820
I have a family,

25:45.920 --> 25:50.032
and I want something better for them
than war, and I think it's possible.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.535
Have you any children, Captain?

25:52.635 --> 25:54.719
- No.
- Married?

25:55.971 --> 25:58.806
I married a girl in England.
She was killed.

25:59.934 --> 26:02.060
Bombers?

26:02.186 --> 26:06.632
No. When the war broke out, I got passage
for her on my freighter for home -

26:06.732 --> 26:09.135
the one that was torpedoed in half.

26:09.235 --> 26:13.389
I was aft when it happened. I watched
the other half of the ship just slide away.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.975
There wasn't anything
I could do about it.

26:16.075 --> 26:20.437
I saw her run out on the foredeck,
and I heard her call my name,

26:20.537 --> 26:24.290
then that half of the ship
just turned over and went down.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.965
We hadn't been married very long.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.245
Ring up the fire room.
Tell 'em we're making smoke.

26:36.345 --> 26:39.347
- I don't wanna see that at dawn.
- Aye aye, sir.

26:39.723 --> 26:43.419
You got more reason than the rest of us
to wanna catch this submarine.

26:43.519 --> 26:48.257
- It might be the one that...
- It might be, but this isn't my private war.

26:48.357 --> 26:51.927
I'm just doing what I have to do.
Like that German captain out there.

26:52.027 --> 26:55.181
I don't like the job,
and maybe he doesn't either.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.866
- Weather from Fleet Weather Control, sir.
- Thank you.

27:05.874 --> 27:10.878
We're moving into a high-pressure area.
We're going to have a clear day.

27:25.894 --> 27:31.232
Set ASW condition one.
All hands, man your battle stations.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.008
All repair parties manned and ready.
Condition able.

28:13.108 --> 28:17.153
- Quartermaster Quiroga at the helm.
- Quartermaster Spencer on annunciator.

28:17.279 --> 28:20.349
Engineering spaces manned and ready.
All boilers on the line.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.533
Maximum speed available, 24 knots.

28:25.746 --> 28:29.441
- Sonar gear manned and ready.
- Magazines manned and ready.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.527
Sky one, mount 33, manned and ready.

28:31.627 --> 28:34.029
Sky one, mount 32,
manned and ready, sir.

28:34.129 --> 28:37.173
- 41, manned and ready.
- Mount 31, manned and ready.

28:37.299 --> 28:40.176
- All guns manned and ready.
- Very well.

28:48.644 --> 28:52.381
- The ship is smart and quick, Mr. Ware.
- We've a willing bunch of boys.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.565
Messenger.

28:55.651 --> 28:59.638
When that U-boat pulls the plug,
code this dispatch for Fleet Operations.

28:59.738 --> 29:05.076
"Have tracked U-boat 130 miles,
bearing 140. Now engaging enemy."

29:05.661 --> 29:07.995
And give our grid position.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.986
Let's get after the target.
Mr. Merry, ring up flank speed.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.670
All engines ahead flank.

29:42.364 --> 29:45.074
I've got him, sir! A conning tower!

29:45.200 --> 29:47.243
Where away?

29:48.120 --> 29:51.372
Three degrees off
the starboard bow. 6,000 yards.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.087
- Main batteries ready?
- Reported ready, sir.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.090
We might get close enough for a shot
before he pops under.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.468
Ship off stern, Herr Schwaffer.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.224
Alarm.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.083
Target diving.

30:41.757 --> 30:46.511
Right ten degrees rudder.
Steady up on 170.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.472
Slow to two-thirds speed.

30:50.432 --> 30:53.001
Slow to two-thirds speed, sir?

30:53.101 --> 30:56.687
It's not necessary
to repeat the order, Quartermaster.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.008
- Aye aye, sir.
- Zigzag, sir?

31:00.108 --> 31:03.720
- Negative zigzag.
- Aye aye, sir.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.614
170 at ten knots.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.450
We're a sittin' duck,
that's what we are.

31:17.584 --> 31:22.672
- We're presenting our beam to the enemy?
- I'm giving him a shot with the stern tubes.

31:22.798 --> 31:26.368
You can't reload those tubes.
We can attack up his tail when we want.

31:26.468 --> 31:30.372
Yes, sir. How will we know
when he's firing, sir?

31:30.472 --> 31:32.916
I'll give him five minutes
to get to emergency depth,

31:33.016 --> 31:35.043
three to come up to periscope depth,

31:35.143 --> 31:37.463
another two minutes
to get us in his sights.

31:37.563 --> 31:42.316
If he's any kind of a captain, he'll spit
the fish out ten minutes from now.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.162
Level.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.002
Seal.

32:08.969 --> 32:13.180
Engine room clear. Forward torpedo room
clear. Aft torpedo room clear.

32:13.307 --> 32:15.349
U-boat all ready for action.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.351
Silent routine.

32:22.524 --> 32:26.360
He is crossing our stern
to starboard, Herr Kapitän.

32:27.321 --> 32:29.363
He does not approach.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.021
I do not understand, Herr Kapitän.

32:36.121 --> 32:39.441
He doesn't zigzag,
and he holds course away from us.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.626
Give them to me.

32:48.133 --> 32:51.052
He is clever, or he is a fool.

32:56.516 --> 32:59.518
Maybe he is too clever, or too foolish.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.898
We'll see. Bring the ship
up to periscope depth.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.245
45.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.920
30.

33:27.214 --> 33:29.340
25.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.970
18 meters, Herr Kapitän.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.479
American escort destroyer.

33:59.579 --> 34:01.288
One stack.

34:01.748 --> 34:05.251
Three-inch guns fore and aft.

34:07.045 --> 34:11.632
Antiaircraft midships. No tubes.

34:26.063 --> 34:29.426
Buckley class destroyer escort.
Maximum speed 25 knots.

34:29.525 --> 34:33.597
Carries stern racks and K-guns.
Capable of dropping 17 patterns.

34:33.697 --> 34:36.975
Carries latest underwater
detection gear.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.159
I think we use the stern tubes.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.871
Ready stern tubes for underwater attack.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.210
Target red 90.

35:30.212 --> 35:31.837
Range 1,000.

35:33.673 --> 35:37.760
- Torpedo speed 30 knots.
- Red 90. 1,000. Speed 30.

35:38.261 --> 35:42.374
Firing position six degrees,
torpedo deflection ten.

35:42.474 --> 35:46.018
Running speed 30, depth two meters.
Fire both torpedoes.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.632
On.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.900
- Yeah.
- On.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.986
On.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.743
- Yeah.
- On. Standing by.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.121
Port six degrees.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.671
Firing position, Herr Kapitän.

36:14.047 --> 36:16.032
Torpedoes ready?

36:16.132 --> 36:17.758
Ready.

36:17.926 --> 36:24.249
- Count.
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

36:24.349 --> 36:27.711
five, four, three,

36:27.811 --> 36:30.479
two, one, zero.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.555
Torpedoes running.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.781
Running time?

36:42.117 --> 36:44.785
One minute, 40 seconds, Herr Kapitän.

37:09.978 --> 37:12.730
Left full rudder.

37:20.488 --> 37:24.309
High-speed propellers
coming in from port side.

37:24.409 --> 37:28.162
Stop port engine.
Starboard engine ahead full.

37:35.128 --> 37:36.822
Torpedoes off the port bow.

37:36.922 --> 37:41.175
All ahead standard.
Stop your swing and steady up.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.816
The Miami yacht races
were never like this.

37:58.193 --> 38:02.305
Hey, Corky. How do you suppose
the captain knew when to turn this old tub?

38:02.405 --> 38:06.810
Because he's the captain,
and that's the reason he is and you ain't.

38:06.910 --> 38:11.439
All right, let's go get 'em. All engines ahead
full. Ring up 18 knots. Steady as you go.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.651
All engines ahead full.
Ring up 18 knots. Steady as you go.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.835
Aye aye, sir.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.886
Down to 100. Emergency.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.432
Steer 140.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.192
I do not see how we missed
at that range.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.528
We shouldn't have.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.640
I think this American captain
is no amateur.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.825
Well, neither am I.

38:53.456 --> 38:56.067
Sonar, Captain.
Commence underwater search.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.086
Make sure it's piped through
onto the bridge speaker.

38:59.212 --> 39:01.672
Aye aye, sir. Lowering sonar projector.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.100
Sonar searching beam to beam, sir.

39:21.776 --> 39:25.320
- Who's on sonar, Mr. Ware?
- Lewis, sir. He's good at the job.

39:43.923 --> 39:44.965
That's him.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.885
Got him, sir.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.641
Keep that open.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.423
Target's still on the old course of 140.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.900
We'll turn to 140
when we're astern of him.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.962
Sonar lash, Herr Kapitän.
He has made contact.

40:39.062 --> 40:42.173
- Do you wish to change course?
- No, not yet.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.817
We wait until he thinks
he has our depth.

40:47.821 --> 40:52.100
- We're gonna be on him pretty quickly, sir.
- Depth-charge party wants depth setting.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.369
Set to 75. But I may want
to alter that before we fire.

40:55.703 --> 40:58.372
Set pattern for 75.

41:12.554 --> 41:15.305
- Set.
- Load.

41:16.641 --> 41:17.724
Loaded.

41:19.227 --> 41:23.105
Range 500, closing fast.

41:30.530 --> 41:33.516
- 300 yards, sir.
- Pattern set to 75, sir.

41:33.616 --> 41:34.658
Stand by to fire.

41:43.293 --> 41:46.170
Port red three. Down to 150.

42:01.519 --> 42:05.256
He's going deeper.
Mr. Ware, reset depth charges to 150.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.425
Aye aye, sir.

42:07.525 --> 42:11.445
Reset at 150.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.911
Secure it.

42:20.246 --> 42:23.081
Fire one.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.133
Fire two.

42:56.032 --> 42:59.894
Come on, Ellis. Get the lead out.
Get up off your dime.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.037
- Casualty here.
- Fire three.

43:20.348 --> 43:22.432
Mr. Ware.

43:23.518 --> 43:25.602
Stand by.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.856
- Time the reload.
- Aye aye, sir.

43:34.862 --> 43:35.946
Get a replacement.

44:07.729 --> 44:10.063
Port red three. Release Bold.

44:32.420 --> 44:37.325
Sonar, Captain. He's using some kind
of a decoy. Can you pick him out of it?

44:37.425 --> 44:41.094
He's coming out of it now, sir,
heading about 080 degrees.

44:44.932 --> 44:47.309
Left ten degrees rudder.

44:47.435 --> 44:50.922
Reset depth-charge pattern to 150.

44:51.022 --> 44:55.359
Increase rudder to 30 degrees left.
Steady up on 080.

45:03.826 --> 45:07.329
Reverse course and take it up to 50.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.729
Level.

46:12.019 --> 46:14.187
Echo faded. I've lost contact.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.508
- Lewis can't find him, sir.
- Secure underwater search.

46:17.608 --> 46:20.193
Reduce speed to two-thirds.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.436
Mr. Mackeson.

46:28.536 --> 46:31.356
- I'm giving you a hypothetical problem.
- Aye, Captain?

46:31.456 --> 46:33.941
Take our last contact
with the target as a start.

46:34.041 --> 46:36.444
Our course was 164, sir.

46:36.544 --> 46:38.654
Give the target a course of 260,

46:38.754 --> 46:41.157
keep him on it for 30 minutes
at a speed of four knots.

46:41.257 --> 46:43.743
260, 30 minutes, four knots.

46:43.843 --> 46:47.872
Bring him back on course 140
for 30 minutes at a speed of eight knots.

46:47.972 --> 46:51.334
140, 30 minutes, eight knots.

46:51.434 --> 46:55.463
We'll hold our present course
and speed for half an hour.

46:55.563 --> 46:57.063
30 at 18.

46:57.356 --> 47:00.734
From there, give me a course
and speed to intercept the target.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.553
Will we make a lost-contact search?

47:02.653 --> 47:05.014
We won't catch this bird
in a search pattern.

47:05.114 --> 47:08.518
I'm sure he's come off our keel
and scooted in the opposite direction.

47:08.618 --> 47:11.912
Our course would be 239 degrees,
speed 19 knots.

47:12.205 --> 47:15.983
We would intercept in 28 minutes
from the beginning of the run, sir.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.151
All right, we'll try it.

47:17.251 --> 47:19.821
Target might not come back
on course 140.

47:19.921 --> 47:22.240
I think he will.
He's got an important mission.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.700
Nothing'll stop him short of being sunk.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.661
Pass the word to battle stations:
stand easy.

47:26.761 --> 47:28.303
Aye aye, sir.

47:31.307 --> 47:33.668
He fades, Herr Kapitän.

47:33.768 --> 47:35.894
He goes away.

47:37.939 --> 47:41.175
You think he's given up, Herr Kapitän?

47:41.275 --> 47:43.469
It's possible.

47:43.569 --> 47:47.697
But, to be certain,
we hold this course for a while,

47:47.949 --> 47:49.991
before we turn again to 140.

47:59.043 --> 48:00.752
- Captain, sir?
- Well?

48:00.878 --> 48:03.964
- How're we doin'?
- You're doin' all right, sailors.

48:07.134 --> 48:09.370
That guy Robbins is 180 out.

48:09.470 --> 48:11.846
- This guy is no feather merchant.
- You said it.

48:20.731 --> 48:22.816
I had to amputate his fingers.

48:36.372 --> 48:38.733
What was your time on reloading,
Mr. Crain?

48:38.833 --> 48:41.986
Three minutes three, the first time.
Two minutes 40, the second.

48:42.086 --> 48:44.379
Right on. Give your crew
a "well done" for me.

48:44.505 --> 48:46.548
Thank you, sir.

48:47.425 --> 48:50.302
Lie still, sailor.
You're out of the war now.

48:51.554 --> 48:53.471
Is it bad?

48:54.348 --> 48:56.918
You've lost your fingers. It's my fault.

48:57.018 --> 48:59.670
I shouldn't have tripped
the racks so quickly.

48:59.770 --> 49:03.007
No, sir. I oughtn't
to have had my hand on the rail.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.191
I guess I got excited, sir.

49:05.860 --> 49:09.305
We'll get you flown stateside
as soon as we put back into Trinidad.

49:09.405 --> 49:12.532
You'll be back in your
civvy job in no time at all.

49:13.868 --> 49:16.620
I was a watchmaker.

49:20.374 --> 49:22.876
Operational priority dispatch
coming in, sir.

49:23.002 --> 49:26.588
Ask the executive officer
to join me in the crypto room.

49:29.091 --> 49:32.510
Well, you won't be
making any watches again.

49:33.387 --> 49:36.514
No, sir. But I'll make out all right.

49:37.642 --> 49:39.768
I'd bet on that.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.633
- All right, let's get him to bed.
- Did we get the sub, sir?

49:45.733 --> 49:47.817
No, we missed him.

49:48.569 --> 49:50.904
I'd have given my fingers
to get that sub.

49:51.030 --> 49:53.140
I don't know anything about sub-chasing,

49:53.240 --> 49:56.352
but I rather think
our new captain does. Joe.

49:56.452 --> 49:58.020
If that U-boat is still in the ocean.

49:58.120 --> 50:01.456
I wouldn't give a plugged duck
for its chances.

50:11.300 --> 50:14.928
The dispatch is just
coming through the decoder, sir.

50:20.101 --> 50:24.005
"Destroyers Luckman, Wald, Green,
detached to aid you."

50:24.105 --> 50:29.943
"Anticipate U-boat may be attempting to
rendezvous with German Raider S, U or M."

50:30.653 --> 50:34.432
"Reduce radio traffic to position signal
once every hour. End."

50:34.532 --> 50:37.852
But it'll take 14 or 15 hours for
the destroyers to catch up with us.

50:37.952 --> 50:40.521
Yes. If we're lucky enough
to find that U-boat,

50:40.621 --> 50:45.166
he may tow us up against a raider before
help comes, and that wouldn't be so lucky.

50:45.292 --> 50:48.461
Those murdering wolves can
outgun and outrun us.

50:49.130 --> 50:51.282
How do you feel about it, Mr. Ware?

50:51.382 --> 50:55.119
We're closing the triangle
in 14 minutes, sir.

50:55.219 --> 50:57.303
Well?

50:58.139 --> 51:00.082
Let's push our luck.

51:00.182 --> 51:03.309
- Alert battle stations, Mr. Ware.
- Aye aye, sir.

51:10.192 --> 51:12.720
Voltage is low on port generator.

51:12.820 --> 51:16.474
- I'll call the LE.
- More soup, Herr Kapitän?

51:16.574 --> 51:19.284
More power on the port generator.

51:22.538 --> 51:25.274
It does not taste
like tennis shoes, Herr Kapitän?

51:25.374 --> 51:28.110
It's very good.
The men mistreat you, Cookie.

51:28.210 --> 51:31.447
They make jokes when they are happy.
I don't mind.

51:31.547 --> 51:35.076
- Are they happy now?
- They are proud of you, Herr Kapitän.

51:35.176 --> 51:37.260
Thank you, Cookie.

51:39.680 --> 51:43.475
- It's now nearly 50 minutes, Herr Kapitän.
- Kunz.

51:48.439 --> 51:51.357
Bring the ship up to periscope depth.

51:51.484 --> 51:54.553
Herr Kapitän, the maneuvers
were brilliant.

51:54.653 --> 51:56.696
The Führer would be pleased.

52:15.299 --> 52:18.119
Herr Kapitän? Propellers. 1200 meters.

52:18.219 --> 52:20.094
- Which quarter?
- Port.

52:20.221 --> 52:24.140
- 18 meters.
- Be ready for emergency dive.

52:33.651 --> 52:36.152
Emergency. Down to 80.

52:40.032 --> 52:42.909
The American has read my mind, Heini.

52:56.257 --> 52:59.467
- Water bombs.
- Port red three, down to 150.

53:10.187 --> 53:13.007
- Target turning left.
- Left standard rudder.

53:13.107 --> 53:15.400
Set depth charges to 150.

54:14.251 --> 54:17.613
- Where is the bottom?
- A plateau, Herr Kapitän.

54:17.713 --> 54:19.797
About 310 meters.

54:22.635 --> 54:25.496
It's not possible, Herr Kapitän,
to go that deep.

54:25.596 --> 54:28.681
The pressure would crush the hull.

54:32.645 --> 54:36.105
Port red three. Release Bold.

54:43.113 --> 54:45.198
- The bottom.
- Herr Kapitän...

56:10.117 --> 56:12.160
Level.

56:22.796 --> 56:25.214
Stop engines.

56:47.571 --> 56:50.531
We build them good in Germany, Heini.

57:03.504 --> 57:06.881
He's given me the slip again.
I'm only getting bottom echoes.

57:08.675 --> 57:10.760
Sonar's lost him, Captain.

57:19.269 --> 57:21.354
Give me a Fathometer reading.

57:24.566 --> 57:27.068
150 fathoms, sir.

57:27.194 --> 57:31.765
That's 310 meters.
That's over a thousand feet.

57:31.865 --> 57:33.976
Can he go that deep?

57:34.076 --> 57:36.619
He might like us to think he can't.

57:38.997 --> 57:42.708
Slow down turbines easy until stopped.

57:42.835 --> 57:45.279
I want absolute silence on this ship.

57:45.379 --> 57:51.092
Sonar, this is the captain. Secure, but keep
a close listening watch on the hydrophone.

57:51.218 --> 57:54.428
If he is down there,
I don't think he'll have time to linger.

57:57.015 --> 57:59.043
His engines are fading.

57:59.143 --> 58:01.227
He's not circling?

58:05.858 --> 58:07.900
He's gone, Herr Kapitän.

58:20.914 --> 58:22.957
We will listen for a while.

59:42.663 --> 59:44.747
Doc, this is really a hot one.

59:47.125 --> 59:49.570
At least they're keeping cool
down there.

59:49.670 --> 59:53.005
- "A painted ship on a painted ocean."
- What's that, doc?

59:53.131 --> 59:56.702
I was reminded of "The Ancient Mariner."
It rather fits us right now.

59:56.802 --> 01:00:00.122
Something unreal about this
waiting out here on a deserted sea.

01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:03.724
It'll be real enough
if that pig-boat puts a fish in us.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.421
- Any luck, Rimfire?
- No, sir.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:10.940
Them fish are afraid
they'll make some noise if they bite.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.317
Here, let me try it.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:49.982
I guess you're finding this sun
hard to take after the North Atlantic.

01:01:50.082 --> 01:01:54.611
It doesn't matter. It's always either too
cold or too hot wherever there's a war on.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.046
- Well, have a salt pill.
- Thanks.

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:00.993
We've been floating around
for quite a while.

01:02:01.093 --> 01:02:04.162
Think the U-boat's
gotten away from us again?

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:06.790
No, he's down there all right.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.794
- Beats me how they get men to do it.
- Do what?

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:13.437
Go and sit in that coffin down there.

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:16.315
They're not so bad off.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:20.387
Actually, they stand a better chance
than we do, in this case.

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:23.155
Pretty hard for one ship
to surprise them.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:27.811
Their commander might be able
to knock us off if he's smart enough.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:30.913
- D'you think he is?
- What, smart enough?

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.484
We'll know that when it happens.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.669
I wonder what sort of man he is.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:41.173
Well, he's got his share of guts,
I know that.

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:44.536
If he weren't so bullheaded
about coming back on course 140,

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:49.333
he could have kissed us goodbye
a long time ago, that's all I know.

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:52.184
I have no idea what he is,
or what he thinks.

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:57.189
I don't wanna know the men
I'm trying to destroy.

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:09.102
Yes, I know.

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.704
The American must be far away
by this time.

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:18.461
It's a curious thing,
but I know he's there, waiting.

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:23.784
All right, we go. Silent routine, 140.

01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:26.010
Level.

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:28.220
Course will be 140.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:30.389
Continue silent routine.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.249
Lewis, get up. We got somethin'.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:10.846
- Bridge, Sonar.
- Go ahead, Sonar.

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:15.100
- Propeller cavitation, deep and slow.
- Can you get a heading?

01:04:15.227 --> 01:04:18.755
Can you figure a heading?
Lewis thinks he's moving southeast.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:22.926
Coming back on 140 again.
Alert battle stations.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.178
Commence underwater search.

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:29.114
Give me minimum rpm
on both shafts. Steer 140.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:39.875
Propellers, Herr Kapitän.

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:48.717
He's a devil, Heini.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.724
Somehow...

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:58.769
somehow we must lose him.

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:03.649
Or kill him.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.222
- He's pinpointed.
- Ready to close in?

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.348
No. Pass the word:

01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:14.535
I want a conference with all officers
and chiefs in the wardroom.

01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:18.690
Boatswain's mate. Pass the word.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.709
All officers and chiefs
in the wardroom on the double.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:27.282
We're at a disadvantage
because he can turn sharper than we can.

01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:31.176
We can shake him up,
but a death blow'd be pure luck.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.389
We've expended a third
of our depth charges.

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:39.586
The U-boat can stay underwater
for another 24 hours if he wants to.

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:42.714
If we run out of depth charges,
the offensive will be theirs,

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:46.593
and we'd have to break contact
to get away from his torpedoes.

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:49.638
But we can't follow him
and wait for our ships to join us

01:05:49.738 --> 01:05:54.267
because we might get pulled into a trap
with a German raider before they get here.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:58.162
What we're going to do
is to fight a delaying action.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:02.291
The enemy's about
a thousand yards ahead.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:05.862
We'll hold this distance
for a little while.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:09.131
Then we'll run in,
lay one pattern of charges,

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:12.426
drop back, wait for one hour,
and attack again.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.930
We can keep this routine up
for seven hours.

01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:19.543
He can't get anywhere very fast,

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:23.463
and our ships should be here
by the end of that period.

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:25.298
He might even surface.

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:30.527
Being inside a submarine under attack
is the worst experience you can imagine.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.639
After they see what we're doing,

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:36.851
they might prefer to surrender,
or at least shoot it out.

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:39.119
I want you all to get
as much rest as you can.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:42.566
Stand easy at your stations,
but be ready every time we lunge.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:46.919
It's going to be a long, dull job, but it's
a damn sight worse for the Germans.

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:49.838
We'll begin the routine at 1500.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:06.767
Herr Kapitän, aft torpedo room.
We've got trouble here.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:08.935
Take command.

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:15.442
Stay away from me.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:28.330
We can do nothing with him,
Herr Kapitän.

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.625
Come here, son.

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:38.590
Give me the wrench.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.594
Give it to me.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:50.602
You will come to attention.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.023
It's a part of our work to die.

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.360
But we are not going to die.

01:10:00.572 --> 01:10:02.197
Do you believe me?

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:58.670
He gets more accurate.
He will tear us apart the next time.

01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:03.675
- What do you suggest, Kunz?
- Surface, Herr Kapitän. Surrender.

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:06.845
- Holem?
- I am not concerned, Herr Kapitän.

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:09.640
- Schwaffer?
- I say go on.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:13.211
- The condition of the ship?
- We are not yet hurt.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.354
But we cannot escape.

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:23.137
It will be your privilege to die for the new
Germany. Put this on the ship's turntable.

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:25.223
But the sound will carry, Herr Kapitän.

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:27.517
It will help the American
to know our position.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.701
Put it on.

01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:52.375
- Herr Kapitän, you cannot do this.
- Sing it, Heini.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:53.793
For you, my friend, and you...

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.086
Sing it, Heini.

01:11:55.186 --> 01:12:01.301
...all of us together, here's a toast
to life and to laughter and song

01:12:01.401 --> 01:12:02.760
Good beer, my friend...

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.237
Sing it, Kunz. Sing it, Holem.

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:07.447
Sing it, everybody.

01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:10.200
...as we sing loud and strong

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:14.898
Fill up the flowing steins again
with foam on every lip

01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:19.167
We'll give a skol and shout "Jawohl!"
in lasting fellowship

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:24.157
And when we eye a Lorelei
with captivating ways

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:28.510
May we drink to love
all our livelong days

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:37.936
To you, my friend, and you, my friend,
and all of us together

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:42.508
Here's a toast to life
and to laughter and song

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:47.305
Good beer, my friend, good cheer,
my friend, through every kind of weather

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:51.533
Make the welkin ring
as we sing loud and strong

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:56.121
Fill up the flowing steins again
with foam on every lip

01:12:56.289 --> 01:13:00.709
We'll give a skol and shout "Jawohl!"
in lasting fellowship

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:16.709
Bridge, Sonar. I'm getting
screwy noises from the hydrophone.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:19.170
Sonar reports screwy noises
from the target.

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.422
Tell him to cut it
in on speaker, Ensign.

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:23.982
Put it on the line, Lewis.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:37.913
And when we eye a Lorelei
with captivating ways

01:13:46.798 --> 01:13:49.007
They're havin' a ball down there.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:55.180
I don't think our psychology's working,
Captain.

01:13:56.182 --> 01:14:01.144
No, it's working all right.
I almost wish it wasn't.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.549
All ahead for attack, Mr. Ware.

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:08.151
Maybe we can rip him open
in the middle of a waltz.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.385
Schwaffer.

01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:39.224
Secure oil valves two and three.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:46.466
Number four.

01:14:46.566 --> 01:14:49.818
The valves will not
contain the oil, Herr Kapitän.

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.237
Empty belly tanks into the sea.

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:15.010
Oil slick off the starboard quarter, sir.
It's a big one.

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:18.664
Sonar, we may have hit him hard.
Are his props turning?

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:20.958
Sorry, sir, he doesn't seem
to be a bit dead.

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:23.169
He's going away
at a good clip to starboard.

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:26.589
- Right ten degree rudder.
- Stand by to fire, sir?

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:28.091
No, we'll ride his tail again.

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:31.610
Let him digest that last one.
He can't stay down much longer.

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:35.947
Come back on 140.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.519
- Schwaffer?
- Yeah?

01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:43.413
Ask Braun which way
the American turned after the attack.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.923
He turned to starboard, Herr Kapitän.

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:56.009
Now I will show you something.

01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:00.248
Each time he has attacked,

01:16:00.348 --> 01:16:05.920
we have turned off to port
or starboard to avoid the attack.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:09.882
He drops his water bombs
and runs on for 300 or 400 meters,

01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:13.610
and then turns,
to fall back on our stern.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.822
He doesn't always turn
the same way, but twice he did,

01:16:17.949 --> 01:16:22.937
to run parallel with our course
for a very few minutes.

01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:25.372
In those minutes he was vulnerable.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:30.252
If he does it again, we will be ready.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:35.048
There will not be time
to come up to periscope depth.

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:37.368
But it's possible.

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:39.954
If we spread the four bow torpedoes,

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:44.500
fired all at once,
angled a few degrees apart,

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.685
one may hit.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.922
One will be enough.

01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:54.734
But if he does not turn parallel
to our course, what can we do?

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.863
We will survive until he does.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:09.374
Weather from Fleet Weather Control, sir.

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:16.782
- Mr. Ware.
- Yes, sir?

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:19.994
The weather's gonna get worse
before dawn. There's wind in it.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:23.555
It's gonna be difficult to keep
a fix on the target in the heavy sea.

01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:26.209
- We may as well try to finish him off.
- Immediately?

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:30.437
Immediately. Inform Mr. Crain we'll throw
everything we have left at the target.

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:44.393
- You understand?
- Herr Kapitän, the destroyer is closing.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:47.021
- He comes early.
- We are ready, Herr Kapitän.

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:50.816
You understand
there will not be the usual routine?

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:53.001
Seal torpedo.

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:06.306
- Mr. Ware, set depth charges to 100.
- Aye aye, sir.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:09.100
- Target turning to port, sir.
- Stand by to fire.

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:11.796
Left ten degrees rudder.

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:13.521
Fire.

01:18:28.913 --> 01:18:31.873
He fires too shallow. Up to 50.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:43.385
Now, American, turn the right way
and I'll give you a pretty present.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:50.209
Plot reports he's off our stern.
Course still 140.

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:54.145
Give her a right 15 degree rudder.
We'll make a beam attack.

01:19:00.778 --> 01:19:03.988
He is turning. Starboard 20 degrees.

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:08.535
Halt course.

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:26.579
Go ahead, Sonar. High-speed
propeller effect, all on starboard side.

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.263
Stop port engine. Left full rudder.

01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:46.698
It's a hit.

01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:51.995
Silence.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.861
Come on now. Under both arms, man.

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:03.214
- He's only got one arm, sir.
- Get him to starboard. Easy, boys.

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:08.287
We took the fish to forward fire room.
Fore and aft bulkheads, blown out.

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:11.707
- Fire room and engine room, flooded.
- Can the pumps keep us afloat?

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:17.505
- If they can, it won't be for long.
- Well, make it as long as you can.

01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:20.341
- Aft engine, what's your damage?
- A few valves loose,

01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:23.677
and we're taking water,
but we're still getting steam.

01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:27.473
- How long before you flood out?
- 30 minutes, maybe a little more.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:28.641
Stop your engines,

01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:31.993
but be ready to give me all the power
you have the instant I ask for it.

01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:35.940
Mr. Ware, get a party and light some fires
on deck. Use mattresses and gasoline.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.082
I want it to look
as if the ship is burning.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:41.002
The pumps are operating,
but it's hopeless.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:45.590
I'm sure it is. You go along with Ware
and see if you can give him a hand.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:51.622
Radio, this is the captain. Send this
emergency dispatch to Operations.

01:20:51.722 --> 01:20:54.766
"Hit by torpedo.
Request immediate assistance."

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:14.494
His engines have stopped.
We'll go up to periscope depth.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:17.163
- Periscope depth.
- 18 meters.

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:19.958
That's enough. Get out of here.

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:37.559
Attention, everyone. This is the captain.
I want all of you to listen carefully.

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:42.548
They got one in where it would do the most
damage and we're going to lose the ship.

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:46.302
But we still have a kick left.
We're going to try to use it.

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:51.114
I am hoping that playing dead and the fire
will bring the enemy to the surface.

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:57.036
Except for securing crew and the gun crew
of mount 31, I want you all to abandon ship.

01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:59.998
Repeat: abandon ship.

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:03.376
Get as far away as quickly as you can.

01:22:03.711 --> 01:22:07.573
It's possible the enemy will put
another fish into us without warning.

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:10.508
Now get going. Good luck.

01:22:45.753 --> 01:22:48.671
- 18 meters, Herr Kapitän.
- Steady keel.

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:14.739
We torpedo on the surface. Take it up.

01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:24.248
- Captain.
- Submarine off starboard bow.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.335
This side.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.833
I'm half-surprised he took the bait.

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:44.268
The first foolish thing he's done.
That makes us even.

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:57.031
Tell him that in five minutes
I will finish off his ship.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:07.959
Ready, Herr Kapitän.

01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:11.546
He's given us five minutes. Signalman.

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:17.468
Take this message. Say
"Message understood." Add a "thank you."

01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:21.055
Mount 31, this is the captain.

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:22.833
That sub'll come close abeam.

01:24:22.933 --> 01:24:25.836
As soon as he's broadside,
give him a shell in the stern.

01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:28.505
If we're lucky,
we oughta have a sitting duck.

01:24:28.605 --> 01:24:30.132
Your second target is his deck gun,

01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:33.151
but be quick,
'cause he'll start shooting when we do.

01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:35.903
When I give the command to fire,
continue at will.

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:53.405
Signalman, no point in you and the talker
staying aboard any longer.

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:56.174
Aye aye, sir. Good luck, sir.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:25:00.871
Mr. Ware. Your papers say you were
captain of a racing yacht before the war.

01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:03.347
You must have a good eye
for speed and distance.

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:06.017
- I think I do.
- Would you like to take the helm?

01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:08.186
My pleasure, Captain.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:13.983
This will not take long.
Use only one torpedo, Schwaffer.

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:20.099
Engine room, this is the captain.
Can I still depend on you?

01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:22.533
Say the word,
and I'll give you all we've got.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:38.800
- Crack your throttle wide and get out.
- Turn it on full and get outta here.

01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:52.563
Fire.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.026
Fire, Kunz.

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:09.956
Secondary, fire at the bridge.

01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:19.549
Set the automatic detonators
and get the men out of the ship.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:01.632
Get going.

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:22.721
- Where's Schwaffer?
- I don't know, Herr Kapitän.

01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:26.616
- But the detonators are set, Herr Kapitän.
- Get overboard.

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:54.936
I'll take you up, Heini. Come on.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:02.652
- Hurry up.
- Come on, let's go.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:16.207
Come on, Heini.

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:06.465
- All clear. The boat's laying off stern for us.
- Right behind you.

01:30:57.119 --> 01:30:59.771
Can't you get in closer?
The captain's behind me.

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:03.207
The captain's still aboard.
There, on the deck.

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:21.251
- We gotta help him. Get in there.
- Those U-boats have detonators.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:24.562
I don't care what they have.
Take this boat in - now.

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:20.644
There's no fire on the port side.
We go over that way.

01:32:20.744 --> 01:32:23.230
Do you understand English? Port side.

01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:25.690
Not much time. You go.
I'll bring this man.

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:28.276
Can't you see? This man's dying.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.461
He is my friend.

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:48.130
Stay where you are, Captain.

01:32:48.230 --> 01:32:50.898
Come on, you guys, let's get up there.

01:32:56.321 --> 01:32:58.405
This way. Get up there.

01:33:08.708 --> 01:33:11.210
Hurry, sir,
I'm double-parked downstairs.

01:33:26.017 --> 01:33:30.145
- That's it, Mr. Ware. That's everybody.
- OK, get this thing outta here.

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:56.943
Remember our talk on the bridge,
the weighty one? Death and destruction?

01:35:57.043 --> 01:36:00.739
You might be interested to know
that I've seen another reason for hope.

01:36:00.839 --> 01:36:03.158
Found it in a funny place, too.

01:36:03.258 --> 01:36:06.760
In the middle of an ocean,
right in the middle of a war.

01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:10.415
You had to come a long way to find it,
didn't you, doc?

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:12.584
It was worth the trip.

01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:14.726
Maybe.

01:36:40.670 --> 01:36:43.172
I should have died many times, Captain,

01:36:44.007 --> 01:36:46.341
but I continue to survive, somehow.

01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:51.054
This time, it was your fault.

01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:58.187
I didn't know. Next time,
I won't throw you the rope.

01:37:02.192 --> 01:37:04.067
I think you will.

01:37:05.305 --> 01:37:11.180
