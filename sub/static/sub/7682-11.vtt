01:04.400 --> 01:08.415
Satellite re-entry zone should be
about five minutes ahead, MacGyver.

01:08.415 --> 01:11.021
Roger.

01:14.567 --> 01:17.121
You with me, Pete?

01:17.121 --> 01:18.425
I've got you.

01:18.425 --> 01:20.823
Let's run a final check
on mic levels.

01:20.823 --> 01:22.595
Do you read me?

01:22.595 --> 01:26.506
Affirmative. T esting,
one, two, three, four,

01:26.506 --> 01:28.330
five, six, seven, eight.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.728
- Do you copy?
- Roger.

01:30.728 --> 01:33.283
Activate the camera.

01:35.942 --> 01:38.757
Camera activated. Take a look, Pete.

01:38.757 --> 01:41.364
Looks good.

01:41.364 --> 01:43.971
Recording.

01:51.009 --> 01:53.616
You getting all this, Pete?

01:57.004 --> 01:59.768
Yeah. Camera works fine.

02:01.488 --> 02:05.346
I wonder if he knew
what he was getting into.

02:05.346 --> 02:08.996
He knew the same things all of us knew.
I didn't hold anything back.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.872
Why him, Pete? Why MacGyver?

02:10.872 --> 02:12.906
He has the scientific knowledge,

02:12.906 --> 02:15.773
and knows how to move fast
through rough country.

02:15.773 --> 02:19.214
Aside from that, he's the best
person I know to deal with...

02:19.214 --> 02:22.081
...whatever it is he's gonna
deal with out there.

02:22.081 --> 02:26.982
And he volunteered.
Wouldn't have it any other way.

02:29.485 --> 02:31.726
Satellite re-entry zone coming up.

02:31.726 --> 02:34.333
Stand by for drop-off.

02:36.888 --> 02:40.589
A tragic sight greeted Rancher
Elmer Hoggins this morning.

02:40.589 --> 02:44.864
He awoke to find his entire herd
of 900 sheep lying dead in his fields.

02:44.864 --> 02:47.367
Our reporter, Nancy Bartlett...

02:47.367 --> 02:49.035
As of now we've gone public.

02:49.035 --> 02:51.381
...I own gone, just wiped out.

02:51.381 --> 02:55.448
I've lived next door to this
military station for a lot of years,

02:55.448 --> 02:58.784
and it always bothered me,
but I believe in America.

02:58.784 --> 03:01.391
They told me this
could never happen.

03:01.391 --> 03:04.832
Are you accusing the United States
Government of causing this?

03:04.832 --> 03:08.690
Yes ma 'am, I am. There's nerve gas
over there. Or something.

03:08.690 --> 03:12.235
- Captain, how do you respond to this?
- Categorically denied.

03:12.235 --> 03:16.250
You're denying your installation
is a bio warfare testing site.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.344
Absolutely.

03:17.344 --> 03:20.733
How do you explain the 900
dead sheep in those lands?

03:20.733 --> 03:22.297
We heard of the incident...

03:22.297 --> 03:26.155
I wonder if Dr Millhouse is watching
the results of her experiment.

03:26.155 --> 03:31.682
- What else could have done it?
- I have no further comment.

03:33.089 --> 03:35.852
A harmless organism
sent into space had mutated

03:35.852 --> 03:38.303
into something extremely deadly.

03:38.303 --> 03:42.056
The satellite carrying it
had crashed to Earth without warning.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.924
I had to find the satellite
and retrieve the capsule

03:44.924 --> 03:47.687
before the military
unleashed "Firestorm",

03:47.687 --> 03:54.100
the code name for a napalm strike
to stop the spread of the organism.

03:55.611 --> 04:00.043
Confirming arrival at primary
drop zone. Proceeding to target.

04:00.043 --> 04:04.005
Roger. According to our last fix,
you're about 200 yards from target.

04:04.005 --> 04:07.133
Proceed now 22 degrees,
north by northeast.

04:07.133 --> 04:10.991
Roger. What's the countdown
to Firestorm?

04:11.408 --> 04:14.432
Forty-two minutes.
And counting.

04:16.726 --> 04:18.603
But don't worry.

04:18.603 --> 04:21.314
We've got plenty of time
to get you out of there.

04:21.314 --> 04:23.764
So take it slow and easy.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.371
Slow and easy. Roger.

04:37.893 --> 04:41.542
You can tell your Dr Millhouse
that bug she put in the satellite

04:41.542 --> 04:43.993
kills more than just sheep.

05:09.539 --> 05:13.710
Firestorm aircraft?
What are they doing here?

05:16.160 --> 05:17.985
Only standing by.
It's S.O.P.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.373
I've still got more than 30 minutes.
Get 'em out of here.

05:21.373 --> 05:24.501
I thought we understood the rules
we have to play by.

05:24.501 --> 05:27.108
- Pete?!
- Call them off!

05:27.421 --> 05:28.724
Right now!

05:28.724 --> 05:32.635
I don't want him worried
about getting fried in a napalm strike!

05:32.635 --> 05:35.241
Call them off!

05:37.170 --> 05:40.142
Firestorm team,
extend your radius two miles.

05:40.142 --> 05:42.644
Extend 20 miles, 20 miles!

05:42.644 --> 05:47.441
That's two minutes flying time.
Let's have a margin of safety.

05:47.441 --> 05:51.247
Correction, make that 20 miles
and await further orders.

05:51.247 --> 05:56.825
Roger, Twin Ridge. Extending
patrol radius to two zero miles.

06:13.560 --> 06:17.158
It looks like dense forest.
Watch yourself.

06:17.158 --> 06:19.765
Right.

06:47.135 --> 06:50.316
Whatever it is, it killed them fast.

06:50.316 --> 06:53.444
Dropped 'em right in their tracks.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.614
It's devastating, Pete.

07:03.297 --> 07:06.165
Like walking through a graveyard.

07:06.477 --> 07:08.250
Yeah, we see it.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.648
Do you see any evidence of burning?

07:10.648 --> 07:13.203
The satellite would've been red-hot.

07:13.203 --> 07:15.705
No. Nothing yet.

07:34.474 --> 07:37.185
MacGyver?

07:37.446 --> 07:40.052
I'm okay, Pete.

07:52.877 --> 07:55.171
I've never seen anything like this.

07:55.171 --> 07:57.778
Everything's dead.

08:02.262 --> 08:04.869
Everything.

08:14.253 --> 08:18.007
I see the satellite, Pete.
It's on a...

08:22.959 --> 08:25.566
MacGyver? What's happening?

08:25.566 --> 08:26.974
MacGyver?

08:26.974 --> 08:30.415
What's going on out there?
MacGyver!

08:32.500 --> 08:35.107
Talk to me!

08:36.409 --> 08:39.799
- It's taken him down.
- We don't know that, not yet.

08:39.799 --> 08:43.448
He's flat on his back.
Something dropped him like a rock.

08:43.448 --> 08:45.899
Wait, anything could've happened there.

08:45.899 --> 08:49.913
The recovery plan spells out what
our obligation is if this happens.

08:49.913 --> 08:53.458
I know the plan.
I also know MacGyver!

08:57.212 --> 09:00.236
Hey... listen.

09:01.696 --> 09:04.302
I'm still in one piece.
I'm okay.

09:04.302 --> 09:07.952
His suit got torn, or what wiped out
that area ate through his suit.

09:07.952 --> 09:09.203
He's not answering.

09:09.203 --> 09:12.070
We agreed and MacGyver agreed
what had to be done.

09:12.070 --> 09:18.066
- Wait! We have to give him time!
- It's part of the plan, Pete.

09:20.986 --> 09:23.592
Oh, great. Broken antenna.

09:23.801 --> 09:26.303
Give him time.
Anything could've happened.

09:26.303 --> 09:29.014
We can't take that chance.

09:30.578 --> 09:33.185
Firestorm team, come in.

09:33.237 --> 09:35.531
Give him five more minutes, please!

09:35.531 --> 09:37.356
Pete?

09:37.356 --> 09:39.963
Pete, do we have audio?

09:40.484 --> 09:41.839
Pete?

09:41.839 --> 09:43.925
It could be a technical glitch.

09:43.925 --> 09:47.783
We have a possible Armageddon here.
I can't let that happen.

09:47.783 --> 09:50.546
And neither can you.

09:50.702 --> 09:53.518
Firestorm team,
resume previous coordinates.

09:53.518 --> 09:55.603
Go to code two.

09:55.603 --> 09:59.305
Roger, Twin Ridge, proceeding
to heading zero niner zero.

09:59.305 --> 10:01.651
I now have a lock on kill zone.

10:01.651 --> 10:05.561
ETA to napalm strike: 90 seconds.

10:12.286 --> 10:16.249
Firestorm to Twin Ridge.
80 seconds to kill zone.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.334
Roger, Firestorm. Proceed.

10:18.334 --> 10:20.889
Phelps, listen to me.
Call them off.

10:20.889 --> 10:23.287
Buy him five minutes,
that's all I ask.

10:23.287 --> 10:26.363
I have no choice, Pete,
and you know it.

10:26.363 --> 10:28.240
Firestorm, advise your position.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.273
Sixty seconds to kill zone.

10:30.273 --> 10:31.889
Advise on final approach.

10:31.889 --> 10:34.704
Roger, Twin Ridge.
On approach now.

10:34.704 --> 10:37.103
MacGyver, come in, please!

10:37.103 --> 10:39.396
Answer me, MacGyver!

10:39.396 --> 10:42.577
They're starting the Firestorm run.
Please, come in!

10:42.577 --> 10:45.027
Come on! Come on!

10:45.027 --> 10:48.051
Firestorm, what is your ETA
to napalm drop?

10:48.051 --> 10:50.501
Stall 'em, Pete, stall 'em.

10:50.501 --> 10:53.994
Twin Ridge, Firestorm
is 45 seconds to kill zone.

10:53.994 --> 10:57.539
Roger, Firestorm team.
Stand by to arm weapons.

10:57.539 --> 11:00.042
Roger, Twin Ridge. Standing by.

11:00.042 --> 11:03.796
- You've got to call them back!
- You know better, you saw.

11:03.796 --> 11:07.810
We've got to give him the full time
allowed. That's what we all agreed to.

11:07.810 --> 11:12.033
We agreed to what would happen if this
went bad! Everything's dead out there!

11:12.033 --> 11:17.194
Face it, the only thing that matters
now is killing that organism!

11:17.194 --> 11:19.957
Pete! Phelps!

11:20.635 --> 11:25.327
- Don't do this. Please!
- Arm weapons. Fire when ready.

11:25.327 --> 11:28.977
Roger, Twin Ridge.
Arming weapons.

11:29.081 --> 11:31.688
On final approach now.

11:37.266 --> 11:40.707
I'm here! Do you read me?
I'm okay!

11:42.271 --> 11:47.224
Pete! Phelps!
I'm here, I'm okay!

11:47.433 --> 11:49.935
He's okay! Call them off!

11:50.039 --> 11:53.480
Base to Firestorm,
break it off, break it off.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.869
Break off, Firestorm.
Do you read me?

11:56.869 --> 11:59.736
Roger, Twin Ridge. Breaking off.

12:05.315 --> 12:07.922
Are you all right, MacGyver?

12:09.590 --> 12:11.675
Yeah, Pete.

12:11.675 --> 12:14.282
I'm okay.

12:15.377 --> 12:18.088
Send in the chopper.

12:18.088 --> 12:20.590
We got what we came for.

13:11.422 --> 13:17.939
Right through here, colonel. The
security lab is six stories underground.

13:18.981 --> 13:21.588
Elevator's over there.

13:22.579 --> 13:24.456
What about all your personnel?

13:24.456 --> 13:28.366
They've been told there's
an unscheduled maintenance shutdown.

13:28.366 --> 13:31.233
A pleasant surprise.
A few days paid vacation.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.319
So the place is deserted.

13:33.319 --> 13:38.793
Except for essential personnel,
and only as long as necessary.

13:46.874 --> 13:51.044
Sandra Millhouse feels she can handle
all the testing procedures herself?

13:51.044 --> 13:53.651
That young lady thinks
she can run the world.

13:53.651 --> 13:56.988
What are a few tests on a superbug?

13:59.907 --> 14:03.765
There's a phone
at the security station.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.206
Code 34 to Washington, D.C.

14:07.988 --> 14:10.595
Sandra?

14:27.278 --> 14:29.729
Sandra, are you in there? Sandra?

14:29.729 --> 14:32.492
May I come in? Sandra?

14:35.620 --> 14:39.009
All right, hello, puppy.
How are you?

14:39.113 --> 14:41.824
Dr Millhouse, where are you?

14:51.729 --> 14:53.815
So here you are.

14:53.815 --> 14:57.516
- Hello, Pete.
- Hello, Pete? That's it?

14:57.777 --> 14:59.967
Sandra, how could you do this?

14:59.967 --> 15:03.356
You smuggled that organism
onto a Phoenix satellite!

15:03.356 --> 15:07.683
- It was essential to my work, Pete.
- But you had no clearance!

15:07.683 --> 15:10.290
But as usual, Dr Millhouse
knows best, right?

15:10.290 --> 15:14.304
The same stunt you pulled with that
Dutch Elm Tree disease two years ago.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.389
Haven't you learned anything?

15:16.389 --> 15:18.996
Yes, progress will not wait
for bureaucrats

15:18.996 --> 15:21.446
to get off their duffs
to make a decision.

15:21.446 --> 15:25.930
Because progress can't wait, we are
faced with a potential disaster here!

15:25.930 --> 15:29.162
Listen to me. If you push
the panic button too soon,

15:29.162 --> 15:32.968
we're not gonna learn
anything from this.

15:33.229 --> 15:38.390
Look, don't talk to me about panic.
This has gone as far as I can let it go.

15:38.390 --> 15:42.613
I'm sorry, but you can't be trusted.
You are not a responsible scientist.

15:42.613 --> 15:45.220
How did I know the damn thing
was gonna fall?

15:45.220 --> 15:47.305
Nobody knows that, they fall!

15:47.305 --> 15:51.215
That is why I've been monitoring
growth data on the telemetry gear.

15:51.215 --> 15:54.031
The information I'm receiving
is fantastic.

15:54.031 --> 15:58.254
We have got to see this thing through,
please, don't let them panic.

15:58.254 --> 16:00.548
You don't even hear me, do you?

16:00.548 --> 16:04.249
Sandra, it's over.
It stops, right here.

16:06.856 --> 16:10.870
Word from top says
your man's on his way.

17:39.917 --> 17:46.538
As soon as we incinerate your suit,
we begin the decontamination process.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.643
Can we make this fast?
It's chilly in here.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.155
We'll warm you up quick.

17:59.155 --> 18:02.960
Decontamination chamber's gonna zap
off the outer layer of your skin.

18:02.960 --> 18:07.757
Strictly a precaution.
There's eyecups in there. Put 'em on.

18:07.757 --> 18:11.041
- Set it on medium well.
- Will do.

18:23.449 --> 18:26.056
All set.

18:37.891 --> 18:40.341
Okay. That's it, Mr MacGyver.

18:40.341 --> 18:44.303
You'll step out,
we'll get you dusted off.

18:58.119 --> 19:01.977
With 2,000 acres already burned,
and thousands more in jeopardy,

19:01.977 --> 19:05.262
the remote Twin Ridge forest fire
blazes out of control.

19:05.262 --> 19:08.755
Authorities see little hope
of containment at this hour,

19:08.755 --> 19:11.674
with 60 mile an hour winds
adding to the danger.

19:11.674 --> 19:14.802
Three hundred firefighters
battle the flames,

19:14.802 --> 19:17.774
and reserve teams brought up
from the Sierra...

19:17.774 --> 19:21.841
Thornton and Dr Millhouse are
about to start the test on the canister.

19:21.841 --> 19:23.665
You're not gonna be there?

19:23.665 --> 19:27.836
I have to give Washington an update,
then look into buying that sheep ranch.

19:27.836 --> 19:32.268
- MacGyver, about Firestorm, I...
- Not necessary.

19:32.476 --> 19:34.822
You had your orders.

19:34.822 --> 19:37.220
This is the same area,
you may remember,

19:37.220 --> 19:41.912
where Rancher Elmer Hoggins found
more than 900 sheep dead just yesterday.

19:41.912 --> 19:45.666
The Hoggins ranch
was consumed by flames.

20:04.330 --> 20:06.520
Will you look at that, Pete?

20:06.520 --> 20:08.866
In the few months
the organism was there,

20:08.866 --> 20:13.193
the weightless vacuum of space
allowed it to mutate at an amazing rate.

20:13.193 --> 20:15.279
An alarming rate is more like it.

20:15.279 --> 20:17.573
Come on, you're missing the point.

20:17.573 --> 20:21.535
All I sent up was a simple mixture
of synthetic growth accelerators.

20:21.535 --> 20:23.881
And it came back something else.

20:23.881 --> 20:26.071
Something I've never seen before.

20:26.071 --> 20:28.834
Whatever it is, it's killing things.

20:28.834 --> 20:31.649
MacGyver, this is Dr Millhouse.

20:31.649 --> 20:34.152
Dragon Lady,
as I'm sure you've been told.

20:34.152 --> 20:36.133
- Nice work out there.
- Thanks.

20:36.133 --> 20:38.218
- Shall we get on with this?
- Yes.

20:38.218 --> 20:41.346
First of all, I want to see
how the organism affects

20:41.346 --> 20:43.953
a live test subject.

20:51.982 --> 20:54.589
Haven't enough animals died
for one day?

20:54.589 --> 20:58.551
This is a laboratory, not a
high school biology class, MacGyver.

20:58.551 --> 21:02.409
Look, doctor, I saw animals out there
dropped dead on the spot.

21:02.409 --> 21:05.068
They didn't get sick,
didn't run off and hide.

21:05.068 --> 21:08.144
They just died, hundreds of them.

21:12.575 --> 21:15.234
Point made.

21:16.746 --> 21:18.883
Well, what about the satellite?

21:18.883 --> 21:22.012
Was there enough of it
to show what caused it to go down?

21:22.012 --> 21:23.836
No, re-entry fried it.

21:23.836 --> 21:26.443
There was a crack
at one end of that canister.

21:26.443 --> 21:29.050
Are you implying
that there's a connection?

21:29.050 --> 21:33.690
Oh, come on, you created
this thing. You tell us.

21:36.297 --> 21:38.903
Let's take a look.

21:54.335 --> 21:56.942
Everything's new here.

21:57.568 --> 22:00.279
The DNA structure is changed.

22:00.331 --> 22:04.241
And whatever it is,
it's getting stronger.

22:04.762 --> 22:06.535
What do you mean, stronger?

22:06.535 --> 22:08.777
This is so far
from the organism I sent,

22:08.777 --> 22:13.104
we could be dealing with
an entirely new form of life here.

22:13.104 --> 22:16.075
I got the pathologist's report
on those dead sheep.

22:16.075 --> 22:17.483
And?

22:17.483 --> 22:19.881
"Arterial blockage,
brain malfunction,

22:19.881 --> 22:22.436
rapid and sudden
muscle deterioration..."

22:22.436 --> 22:23.531
My God.

22:23.531 --> 22:26.920
- Well, what does that mean?
- They died of old age.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.526
Washington wants
to discuss its disposition.

22:29.526 --> 22:34.166
Great, I guess this means we kill it,
before we have a chance to understand.

22:34.166 --> 22:37.190
Come on, this bug has already
shown us what it can do!

22:37.190 --> 22:41.204
Don't you understand the potential?
Four crops a year instead of two,

22:41.204 --> 22:43.811
livestock that matures
three times as fast.

22:43.811 --> 22:46.679
Shorter gestation.
The potentials are endless.

22:46.679 --> 22:49.963
So are the risks. What if that thing
had dropped on a city?

22:49.963 --> 22:53.456
It didn't. Pete,
what are you going to tell them?

22:53.456 --> 22:56.115
The truth.

23:01.329 --> 23:03.779
I suppose you think
I'm a crackpot too?

23:03.779 --> 23:07.011
No, I think you're
a dedicated scientist...

23:07.011 --> 23:09.618
...who's gone too far.

23:09.618 --> 23:12.798
May I show you
just how far I've gone?

23:12.798 --> 23:15.405
Please.

23:37.510 --> 23:40.899
This is what Dr Sandra Millhouse
is all about.

23:40.899 --> 23:44.079
Some day, soon, I'm going to
be able to plant these trees

23:44.079 --> 23:46.634
in the Sahara, the Arctic,

23:46.634 --> 23:48.719
and they will still bear fruit.

23:48.719 --> 23:52.786
Heat, cold, pollution,
they won't be a problem. And why?

23:52.786 --> 23:56.435
Because they've absorbed
organisms created in this lab.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.260
Created by me.

23:58.260 --> 24:02.848
Look, doctor, no one is saying
your work isn't valid.

24:02.848 --> 24:06.184
I'm a big fan of experimentation.

24:06.341 --> 24:09.104
But there comes a time
when you have to acknowledge

24:09.104 --> 24:13.118
a right and a wrong way
of doing things.

24:13.275 --> 24:16.611
Have you ever seen hunger,
MacGyver?

24:17.446 --> 24:19.792
Yes ma'am, I have.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.920
I've also seen what an
out of control experiment can do.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.005
Those animals? 900 sheep.

24:25.005 --> 24:28.394
What about the millions
who starved in Africa last year?

24:28.394 --> 24:31.209
That is not a rational argument.

24:31.209 --> 24:35.432
Yes it is. If you watched a child
starve to death,

24:35.432 --> 24:39.082
or seen old people living on dog food,
you might understand.

24:39.082 --> 24:41.897
An end to world hunger.
That's it, huh?

24:41.897 --> 24:44.504
You're not the only one
who wants to see that.

24:44.504 --> 24:48.831
I'm on to something
that can make it happen.

24:48.987 --> 24:53.367
So I don't care about right ways
or wrong ways. I care about results.

24:53.367 --> 24:57.068
And I'm going to keep on caring
until I have my answers.

24:57.068 --> 25:01.708
Yes, I'm sure you will.
But this isn't the way.

25:05.149 --> 25:09.528
The decision's made. We've got
orders to destroy the organism.

25:09.528 --> 25:11.927
No.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.491
No, Pete.

25:13.491 --> 25:19.955
I am not going to have years of work
lost because of a paranoid bureaucrat.

25:19.955 --> 25:22.041
Attention, all personnel.

25:22.041 --> 25:26.889
Attention, bio lab seal integrity
compromised. Attention...

25:26.889 --> 25:31.425
- The lab!
-...bio lab seal integrity compromised.

25:43.155 --> 25:46.023
- Attention, all personnel...
- What's happening?

25:46.023 --> 25:48.265
...lab seal integrity compromised.

25:48.265 --> 25:53.217
- What's wrong with the seal?
- I don't see anything.

25:56.450 --> 25:58.014
There. There, look.

25:58.014 --> 26:01.038
Pete! Stop! Don't touch it.

26:05.626 --> 26:10.057
- Sandra, what is going on?
- I'm not sure, Pete.

26:10.318 --> 26:13.029
It's mutating even further.

26:13.446 --> 26:17.356
Whatever it's become, it's eating
through that sealing compound.

26:17.356 --> 26:19.024
It's getting loose.

26:19.024 --> 26:22.778
Attention. If seal integrity
is not restored,

26:22.778 --> 26:26.479
destruct sequence
must begin in seven minutes.

26:26.479 --> 26:30.755
Repeat. Destruct sequence
in seven minutes.

26:41.599 --> 26:44.205
If seal integrity is not restored,

26:44.205 --> 26:46.812
destruct sequence
will begin in six...

26:46.812 --> 26:49.419
Stay away from that window.

26:51.348 --> 26:53.955
Wait!

27:06.467 --> 27:11.263
- What are you going to do?
- Got to seal it, Pete.

27:12.045 --> 27:16.216
Attention. If seal integrity
is not restored,

27:16.268 --> 27:21.325
destruct sequence
will begin in six minutes.

27:39.468 --> 27:42.805
Attention. If seal integrity
is not restored...

27:42.805 --> 27:46.611
- That's not going to stop it.
- Not by itself, you're right.

27:46.611 --> 27:51.668
-...and a half minutes.
- Sandra, give me a hand here.

27:52.711 --> 27:55.109
Keep that going right there.

28:04.180 --> 28:08.508
- What are you gonna do?
- Gonna use the Freon.

28:10.958 --> 28:13.721
Need a pliers, vice grips, anything.

28:13.721 --> 28:15.285
I'll see what I can find.

28:15.285 --> 28:19.560
Attention. If seal integrity
is not restored...

28:20.134 --> 28:23.105
- Here!
-...will begin in five minutes.

28:23.105 --> 28:25.816
Perfect.

28:38.381 --> 28:39.632
Attention,

28:39.632 --> 28:42.760
- Stand back.
-...if seal integrity is not restored,

28:42.760 --> 28:47.609
destruct sequence will begin
in four and a half minutes.

28:47.609 --> 28:49.016
What's he doing?

28:49.016 --> 28:52.301
He put the torch on it before
to melt the casement material

28:52.301 --> 28:57.619
so it would fill in the holes.
Now freezing it locks it tight.

28:57.619 --> 29:01.007
- Right?
- That's pretty good, Pete.

29:12.790 --> 29:16.179
Attention. Seal integrity restored.

29:16.439 --> 29:19.307
Resume non-emergency status.

29:19.567 --> 29:23.425
- All right. Now kill that thing!
- No.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.909
That patch isn't gonna last forever,
and whatever that is,

29:27.909 --> 29:34.530
it could mutate into something that
can eat through glass. Now, come on.

29:39.066 --> 29:41.725
Laser on line.

29:52.621 --> 29:55.228
Do it!

30:08.574 --> 30:12.484
How can we be absolutely sure
that thing is dead?

30:12.484 --> 30:15.091
There's only one way.

31:17.236 --> 31:19.947
I'll inform Washington.

31:20.364 --> 31:24.118
One giant step backwards for mankind.

31:24.170 --> 31:27.037
Why don't you two go back
to where you came from

31:27.037 --> 31:30.113
and get the hell out of my lab.

31:46.796 --> 31:51.749
Listen, you go on ahead,
and I'll catch up with you.

31:56.441 --> 31:58.944
Yes?

31:59.465 --> 32:01.811
You're pushing it, MacGyver.

32:01.811 --> 32:05.096
- Can't I even say goodbye?
- Goodbye.

32:05.096 --> 32:08.432
Look, for what it's worth,

32:08.485 --> 32:13.698
the things you're trying to do,
I think they're good things.

32:13.698 --> 32:17.191
Thank you. But I've decided
to go on to a different direction.

32:17.191 --> 32:20.580
I'm going to develop
an organism that eats red tape.

32:20.580 --> 32:23.082
Hey, I'm not a big fan
of red tape either.

32:23.082 --> 32:25.689
But this...

32:26.054 --> 32:27.775
I agree with 'em.

32:27.775 --> 32:29.599
- Some things take time.
- Time.

32:29.599 --> 32:32.571
This is time, MacGyver.
Time well spent.

32:32.571 --> 32:37.680
Years of research that ultimately
could feed the world.

32:40.131 --> 32:43.259
Don't miss your chopper, MacGyver.

32:47.429 --> 32:52.122
One thing happened here.
You saw what was possible.

32:52.122 --> 32:56.136
Might take a little longer, but the
world's gonna hear from you again.

32:56.136 --> 32:58.743
You can be sure of it.

33:14.644 --> 33:19.597
I'll be in touch with the final report.
Thanks again.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.896
I'm glad that's over with.

33:26.896 --> 33:29.502
Me too. What's gonna
happen to her, Pete?

33:29.502 --> 33:33.829
I've gotta make my recommendation.
I'm afraid that's not gonna be too good,

33:33.829 --> 33:36.436
but it's really up
to the executive board.

33:36.436 --> 33:39.408
She and that dog
are gonna land safely someplace.

33:39.408 --> 33:41.493
She's too good not to.

33:41.493 --> 33:44.882
Did I tell you the story about
how she smuggled another bug

33:44.882 --> 33:46.603
out of the lab a few years ago?

33:46.603 --> 33:48.949
Had to do with
Dutch Elm Disease, right?

33:48.949 --> 33:52.754
She transfused the bug
into the dog's bladder.

33:52.754 --> 33:54.840
Yeah. He smuggled it out.

33:54.840 --> 33:58.437
All she had to do was lead it
to the trees, let him lift the old leg.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.262
- Did it work?
- Yeah.

34:00.262 --> 34:03.129
Strongest stand of Dutch Elm
in the whole country.

34:03.129 --> 34:06.257
But, that's the problem.
She doesn't stop.

34:06.257 --> 34:11.523
- She won't give up.
- Yeah, well she gave up this time.

34:12.043 --> 34:17.101
- What?
- She gave up way too easily.

34:28.728 --> 34:31.333
Come on.

34:43.168 --> 34:47.496
Well at least you still love me,
don't you, Ace?

34:47.496 --> 34:50.103
Well the hell with them.

34:57.506 --> 35:00.113
Come on, come on.

35:10.800 --> 35:14.189
All right, that's good.
We'll play in a little bit don't worry.

35:14.189 --> 35:16.796
Right now...

35:16.900 --> 35:19.142
...we...

35:19.142 --> 35:21.853
...have a lot of work to do.

35:22.114 --> 35:24.720
Sandra?

35:31.498 --> 35:33.218
I'm sorry, MacGyver.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.460
How'd you do it?

35:35.460 --> 35:39.370
Well I knew they were going
to destroy it. Or at least try to.

35:39.370 --> 35:44.584
So I took just a little bit of a smear
before Pete got back to the lab.

35:44.584 --> 35:47.921
It's too big a breakthrough.
I couldn't just walk away.

35:47.921 --> 35:49.380
It's too dangerous!

35:49.380 --> 35:52.613
Nothing is going to happen.
Look what we have here.

35:52.613 --> 35:54.959
Look at this.

35:54.959 --> 35:57.565
No! Don't!

35:57.618 --> 36:00.224
Ace! Stay stay away, baby!

36:14.249 --> 36:16.855
Sandra.

36:23.268 --> 36:26.917
Stay away from there, baby.
Stay away.

36:27.960 --> 36:31.610
Oh, Ace. Ace, come here.

36:33.695 --> 36:36.145
Come here, baby.
Come here.

36:36.145 --> 36:37.866
Oh,
Ace, baby.

36:37.866 --> 36:42.558
Does it hurt?
Oh, no.

36:43.340 --> 36:46.312
Please tell me it doesn't hurt.

36:48.449 --> 36:51.577
Attention. Contamination recorded.

36:51.786 --> 36:55.957
Hydroponics lab.
Organism unidentified.

36:56.113 --> 36:58.563
This is a priority alert.

36:58.563 --> 37:01.326
Repeat. Priority alert.

37:01.483 --> 37:04.090
So here we are.

37:04.611 --> 37:07.218
I guess you were right.

37:07.426 --> 37:10.085
I love you, Ace.

37:10.554 --> 37:13.578
And look what I've done to you.

37:13.735 --> 37:16.706
My sweet little friend.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.877
I'm so sorry.

37:23.849 --> 37:25.986
I'm sorry.

37:25.986 --> 37:31.408
Attention. Hydroponics lab.
Seal integrity compromised.

37:31.565 --> 37:34.171
Repeat. Hydroponics lab.

37:34.171 --> 37:37.977
Seal integrity compromised.

37:38.186 --> 37:39.541
Sandra! Where is she?

37:39.541 --> 37:43.452
She's in the hydroponics lab.
She held out on us. She's been exposed.

37:43.452 --> 37:45.224
Don't go in there!

37:45.224 --> 37:50.594
Attention. Hydroponics lab.
Seal integrity compromised.

37:50.750 --> 37:56.433
Repeat. Hydroponics lab.
Seal integrity compromised.

37:57.789 --> 38:00.656
Oh, my God.

38:01.699 --> 38:04.253
My dear God.

38:06.860 --> 38:09.467
Here, Pete. Put this on.

38:22.136 --> 38:24.065
Thank you anyway.

38:24.065 --> 38:28.757
Attention. If seal integrity
is not restored,

38:28.913 --> 38:33.084
destruct sequence
will begin in seven minutes.

38:33.970 --> 38:36.577
That's very interesting.

38:36.994 --> 38:40.539
The contagion has mutated...

38:40.748 --> 38:43.355
...to infest plant life.

38:44.449 --> 38:47.056
It didn't do that before.

38:47.942 --> 38:50.445
Sandra...

38:50.445 --> 38:53.052
...I'm sorry.

38:53.260 --> 38:55.867
Pete...

38:57.170 --> 39:00.872
...save my work, please.

39:01.602 --> 39:04.730
All my other work, Pete,

39:04.886 --> 39:08.692
it can be important.

39:09.735 --> 39:11.403
I'll get it.

39:11.403 --> 39:15.470
Attention. If seal integrity
is not restored,

39:16.095 --> 39:19.901
destruct sequence will begin
in six and a half minutes.

39:19.901 --> 39:22.612
Sandra?

39:29.233 --> 39:31.840
I suppose...

39:32.778 --> 39:36.011
...an "I told you so" is in order.

39:36.011 --> 39:40.442
Attention. If seal integrity
is not restored,

39:40.599 --> 39:44.874
destruct sequence
will begin in six minutes.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.301
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

39:56.135 --> 39:59.993
Sandra, we saved 'em.

40:03.277 --> 40:07.552
We've got them.
We're going to get them out.

40:10.159 --> 40:12.662
Thank...

40:12.922 --> 40:15.529
...you.

40:21.785 --> 40:24.496
She's gone, MacGyver.

40:24.653 --> 40:28.823
There's nothing more
we can do for her now.

40:31.274 --> 40:34.975
Attention. Bio laboratories
and corridors

40:35.080 --> 40:36.644
will be sealed in sequence.

40:36.644 --> 40:41.075
They're closing the sections.
We've got to get out of here.

40:41.075 --> 40:42.900
Let's go!

40:42.900 --> 40:46.289
Section one, hydroponics lab, sealed.

40:47.331 --> 40:51.606
Section two,
general biology lab, sealed.

40:51.763 --> 40:56.194
Section three,
bacteriology lab, sealed.

40:56.299 --> 40:58.645
Section four...

40:58.645 --> 41:02.190
The elevator shaft is our only way out!

41:04.536 --> 41:09.384
This facility will self-destruct
in four and a half minutes.

41:09.384 --> 41:13.138
Got to be a maintenance
override switch up top.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.745
You first.

41:17.048 --> 41:19.655
Come on. Here we go.

41:25.286 --> 41:27.997
Push!

41:29.039 --> 41:31.646
Okay, come on.

41:44.680 --> 41:49.268
This facility will self-destruct
in four minutes.

41:50.154 --> 41:52.865
It's too slow!

41:55.889 --> 42:00.581
We're never gonna
get up there before it blows up!

42:17.003 --> 42:21.331
This facility will self-destruct
in three minutes.

42:21.331 --> 42:24.407
What are you doing?
We can't climb out of here.

42:24.407 --> 42:30.559
I'm gonna have to speed things up.
Crank those doors open for me.

42:47.346 --> 42:52.820
This facility will self-destruct
in two and a half minutes.

43:13.205 --> 43:15.812
Come on.

43:16.854 --> 43:19.305
All right, Pete, let the doors go.

43:19.305 --> 43:21.286
Come here and grab this.

43:21.286 --> 43:25.717
This facility will self-destruct
in two minutes.

43:50.169 --> 43:55.538
This facility will self-destruct
in one and a half minutes.

43:56.477 --> 43:59.292
This transformer
should zap the override,

43:59.292 --> 44:02.212
make it all go faster, I think.

44:05.548 --> 44:09.876
First we'll bypass the normal circuit
to the transformer.

44:09.876 --> 44:15.610
That'll juice the power,
and if we're lucky, we're home free.

44:17.696 --> 44:22.232
This facility will self-destruct
in one minute.

44:22.388 --> 44:24.995
All right, it's all yours.

44:27.601 --> 44:30.104
It's working!

44:32.033 --> 44:34.640
I got it.

44:42.460 --> 44:47.778
This facility will self-destruct
in 30 seconds.

44:53.043 --> 44:57.423
This facility will self-destruct
in 20 seconds.

44:57.423 --> 44:59.143
Nineteen...

44:59.143 --> 45:00.811
- Come on!
-...eighteen,

45:00.811 --> 45:05.816
seventeen, sixteen,
fifteen, fourteen,

45:06.025 --> 45:08.371
thirteen, twelve,

45:08.371 --> 45:10.456
eleven,

45:10.456 --> 45:12.437
ten, nine,

45:12.437 --> 45:15.305
eight, seven, six,

45:15.461 --> 45:18.016
- five, four...
- Let's go!

45:18.016 --> 45:22.239
... three, two, one.
Destruct.

45:33.448 --> 45:36.055
Go!

45:47.211 --> 45:51.122
Oh, my God. What a loss.
