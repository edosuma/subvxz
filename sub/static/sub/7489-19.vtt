00:06.182 --> 00:08.860
Hey, Nelson. How's the
school election going?

00:08.861 --> 00:13.513
Great. Whoever gets the most
coats becomes President.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.338
It's votes, Nelson, not coats.

00:16.340 --> 00:19.412
Whoever get's the most
votes becomes President.

00:19.413 --> 00:21.693
Aw, nartz!

00:22.258 --> 00:28.158
Do you know how hot it is wearing
this many coats in Miami?

00:29.572 --> 00:33.838
That's school's in trouble
if that kid wins.

00:33.839 --> 00:36.911
You guys want to come to the Miami
Invention Convention with us?

00:36.912 --> 00:38.391
Dez's dad has a booth.

00:38.392 --> 00:42.017
He's unveiling his latest invention.
It's a shirt made out of napkins.

00:42.018 --> 00:45.378
He calls it the Shirtnap.

00:46.756 --> 00:49.501
Wow. Those shirts are
really made out of napkins?

00:49.502 --> 00:52.680
Yep. And the best part
no matter where you are,

00:52.681 --> 00:56.413
you'll always have something
to wipe your mouth on.

00:56.414 --> 01:00.671
So you just walk around with
stains on your shirt all day?

01:00.672 --> 01:04.751
No, that's what the
Tiekin is for.

01:06.221 --> 01:08.577
Austin Moon, I have great news.

01:08.578 --> 01:09.878
Hey, Jimmy, what's up?

01:09.879 --> 01:13.848
You've been invited to perform at the
World Music Festival this weekend.

01:13.849 --> 01:15.829
What?!

01:17.255 --> 01:21.723
That's huge! If you're a hit, you'll be
a household name all over the world.

01:21.724 --> 01:24.593
I want you guys to write a
new song for the festival.

01:24.594 --> 01:28.697
Maybe if you sell enough copies you
could afford to buy a clean shirt.

01:28.698 --> 01:30.247
Catch you later.

01:30.248 --> 01:33.034
- We still on for rock climbing?
- Never were.

01:33.035 --> 01:36.155
Man, I love that guy.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.402
<i>♪ When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

01:42.403 --> 01:45.537
<i>♪ 'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

01:45.538 --> 01:47.069

<i>♪ You're the perfect chord.</i>

01:48.689 --> 01:51.733
<i>♪ And I see our names

01:51.734 --> 01:54.792

01:54.793 --> 01:56.406
<i>♪ We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

01:56.407 --> 01:58.729

02:02.868 --> 02:05.903

02:05.904 --> 02:08.973
<i>♪ It's no fun when

02:08.973 --> 02:12.296

02:12.297 --> 02:14.946

02:21.443 --> 02:25.883
<i>♪ Do it without ya,

02:31.647 --> 02:33.815
Okay, Dez, I'll meet
you at the convention.

02:33.816 --> 02:35.817
I just need to talk to Ally.

02:35.818 --> 02:37.738
Yeah.

02:38.032 --> 02:40.589
Pens, paper, water,
fruit and pickles...

02:40.590 --> 02:42.131
We're all set.

02:42.132 --> 02:44.064
You prepping for a hurricane?

02:44.065 --> 02:47.400
A hurricane called inspiration.

02:47.401 --> 02:50.034
It may be tough.
It may be painful,

02:50.035 --> 02:54.479
but we're gonna stay in this room
until we write the best song ever.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.514
Did you just lock the door?

02:56.515 --> 02:58.683
I have a million ideas.

02:58.684 --> 03:01.523
Great, I love them all.

03:01.524 --> 03:03.754
I haven't even said
what it is yet.

03:03.755 --> 03:07.833
But you sound really confident, so why
don't you go ahead and write the song

03:07.834 --> 03:09.760
and I'll go to the
Invention Convention.

03:09.761 --> 03:11.976
I'll help you finish
it when I get back.

03:11.977 --> 03:13.831
Oh, yeah. That seems fair.

03:13.832 --> 03:15.874
You go to the
convention and have fun

03:15.875 --> 03:18.703
and I'll stay here and do
all the work by myself.

03:18.704 --> 03:21.782
I'm glad you understand. Thanks, Ally.
You're the best.

03:21.783 --> 03:24.141
It's called sarcasm.

03:24.142 --> 03:29.002
Call the song whatever you want.
I trust you.

03:35.177 --> 03:39.198
Guess who hates her new
job at Rico's Tacos.

03:39.199 --> 03:42.244
I have to pass out
menus, refill salsas,

03:42.245 --> 03:46.385
wait tables, wash
dishes, serve food!

03:46.754 --> 03:49.216
I'm exhausted!

03:49.217 --> 03:51.299
I thought you didn't
start until tonight.

03:51.300 --> 03:56.226
I don't. But just thinking
about it is wearing me out.

03:56.227 --> 04:00.153
Greetings from the
world of tomorrow!

04:00.154 --> 04:02.359
Uh, Dez, what are those?

04:02.360 --> 04:04.482
These are 4-D glasses.

04:04.483 --> 04:09.523
They allow me to taste
whatever I'm looking at.

04:11.124 --> 04:15.401
Hmm. This piano is an oaky
flavor with a taste of...

04:15.402 --> 04:17.502
Pickles.

04:19.665 --> 04:23.819
Dez, those glasses make you look
more ridiculous than usual.

04:23.820 --> 04:26.102
Someone's bitter.

04:26.103 --> 04:29.043
And a little minty.

04:29.383 --> 04:31.973
That convention had
so many cool things.

04:31.974 --> 04:34.565
Here, Ally, I got you something.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.614
The Tune-Pro 3000?

04:36.615 --> 04:38.580
This is the future of music.

04:38.581 --> 04:43.741
You plug in a few notes
hit a few buttons and...

04:44.723 --> 04:47.963
This music tastes great!

04:54.249 --> 04:56.256
This will cut our
songwriting time in half.

04:56.257 --> 04:59.504
I don't feel comfortable using
a machine to write songs.

04:59.505 --> 05:01.673
You can't take shortcuts
to creativity.

05:01.674 --> 05:03.741
Yes, you can. I just did.

05:03.742 --> 05:06.275
Look, I appreciate
the gift, Austin,

05:06.276 --> 05:09.291
but I think we're better off writing
the song the old-fashioned way.

05:09.292 --> 05:10.411
But!

05:10.412 --> 05:16.312
But but but but but the Tune-Pro
3000 is gonna save us so much time.

05:19.591 --> 05:23.251
After I put it back together.

05:25.564 --> 05:28.324
Ah, good as new.

05:34.381 --> 05:36.708
Sounds good to me.

05:36.709 --> 05:38.373
Oh, I'll show Ally.

05:38.374 --> 05:44.274
When she hears my awesome new song with the
Tune-Pro, she's gonna be totally shocked.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:55.027 --> 05:56.627
Whoa.

05:56.628 --> 05:59.864
Must have fallen asleep.

05:59.865 --> 06:01.092
Oh, no!

06:01.093 --> 06:05.833
I was supposed to help
Ally write our song.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.610
Huh?

06:15.481 --> 06:17.057
Whoa.

06:17.058 --> 06:20.598
What happened to Sonic Boom?

06:21.284 --> 06:23.068
Dez, what's going on?

06:23.069 --> 06:25.977
Oh, just trying out
these new 8-D glasses.

06:25.978 --> 06:29.447
They allow me to feel the
emotion of what I look at.

06:29.448 --> 06:32.530
Aw! This chair's so sad.

06:32.531 --> 06:35.500
Don't worry, buddy, someone
will sit on you soon.

06:35.501 --> 06:38.308
8-D glasses? What
happened to 4-D glasses?

06:38.309 --> 06:40.326
Austin, it's the year 2345.

06:40.327 --> 06:44.275
Nobody's used 4-D glasses
in, like, 300 years.

06:44.276 --> 06:46.256
2345?!

06:46.679 --> 06:51.119
I must have slept
longer than I thought.

06:51.208 --> 06:54.448
See, chair? I told you.

07:03.140 --> 07:05.484
This is gonna sound crazy but,

07:05.485 --> 07:10.552
a minute ago it was 2013, and now
you're telling me it's 2345?

07:10.553 --> 07:15.618
No, Austin. It doesn't sound crazy
that you took a 300-year nap.

07:15.619 --> 07:19.638
The last thing I remember is
getting zapped by that Tune-Pro.

07:19.639 --> 07:22.507
- Maybe it's messing with my head!
- Hmm, could be.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.317
Remember when I got
zapped by my hamster-bot

07:24.318 --> 07:26.538
and only spoke
martian for a month?

07:26.539 --> 07:29.419
That was gallifrax!

07:29.515 --> 07:32.062
Oh, yeah. So gallifrax.

07:32.063 --> 07:35.332
So everything here
always looks this...

07:35.333 --> 07:36.582
Plain?

07:36.583 --> 07:41.090
Ever since we won the great plaid wars,
one color makes life so much easier.

07:41.091 --> 07:45.128
Could you imagine me wearing
a bunch of crazy colors? Ha!

07:45.129 --> 07:47.827
So, what happened to
all the instruments?

07:47.828 --> 07:50.563
The guitars, drums, pianos?

07:50.564 --> 07:55.604
Oh, you mean those things
in the museum display?

07:57.232 --> 08:00.772
No one knows how they work.

08:05.021 --> 08:08.447
How did people write music
before the Tune-Pro 21 million?

08:08.448 --> 08:10.583
The Tune-Pro 21 million?!

08:10.584 --> 08:12.090
Aw, I knew it would catch on!

08:12.091 --> 08:14.113
This thing started
the revolution.

08:14.114 --> 08:16.627
After the Tune-Pro came the
Scribble-Pro to do your homework,

08:16.628 --> 08:22.528
then the Chore-Pro to make your bed and the
Strength-Pro to do your workout for you.

08:26.533 --> 08:28.453
Whoa!

08:29.770 --> 08:31.604
I'll work out the rest
of my body later.

08:31.605 --> 08:35.062
We have to study for our
inter-galactic history test.

08:35.063 --> 08:39.443
- Hmm.
- Here, put on your Thought-Pro.

08:42.482 --> 08:46.087
Martians were given the
right to vote in 2318.

08:46.088 --> 08:49.855
Man! With these things I'll never
have to read another book.

08:49.856 --> 08:52.916
The future's awesome!

08:52.929 --> 08:55.209
Hey, guys.

08:55.762 --> 08:57.682
Boop!

08:59.499 --> 09:00.633
Hey, Austin.

09:00.634 --> 09:04.230
Don't forget, we still have to finish our
song for the Galactic Music Festival.

09:04.231 --> 09:08.608
Your song is gonna be beamed
all across the galaxy.

09:08.609 --> 09:10.969
Well, we better get
working on the song now.

09:10.970 --> 09:13.579
Nah, we'll write it after
we meet Trish for lunch.

09:13.580 --> 09:17.264
We've got plenty of time. The
concert's not until tomorrow.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.486
You're right. There's no rush.
We've got the Tune-Pro.

09:20.487 --> 09:22.754
The best shortcut to creativity.

09:22.755 --> 09:24.067
Boop!

09:24.068 --> 09:25.557
Boop!

09:25.558 --> 09:28.258
- Boop.
- Boop.

09:33.399 --> 09:35.319
Whoa!

09:35.535 --> 09:37.770
Here's your toaster
and bionic heart.

09:37.771 --> 09:39.571
Thank you for shopping
at Future Mart.

09:39.572 --> 09:44.677
Where our motto is... we sell everything
except the Tune-Pro 21 million.

09:44.678 --> 09:47.921
Wish we we did sell it, the
motto would be shorter.

09:47.922 --> 09:51.254
Hey, Trish. Can I get a turkey
sandwich on white bread,

09:51.255 --> 09:55.598
a vanilla milkshake and an egg-white
omelet with a side of fettuccini in...

09:55.599 --> 09:57.999
White sauce.

09:58.458 --> 10:02.538
Do you know how
much work that is?

10:06.599 --> 10:10.416
This is the hardest
job I've ever had.

10:10.417 --> 10:11.804
Thank you.

10:11.805 --> 10:13.383
Ooh, can I get some pancakes...

10:13.384 --> 10:16.444
Sorry, I'm on break.

10:18.192 --> 10:19.294
What's going on?

10:19.295 --> 10:23.075
The President's about to speak.

10:24.818 --> 10:26.152
Hello, Miami.

10:26.153 --> 10:29.091
What's up, President Nelson?

10:29.092 --> 10:31.423
Nelson's the President?

10:31.424 --> 10:36.344
Welcome to this year's
Galactic Movie Festival.

10:37.630 --> 10:40.130
It's a music festival?

10:40.131 --> 10:42.139
Aw, nartz!

10:42.140 --> 10:47.960
Do you know how long it took
me to make all this popcorn?

10:48.231 --> 10:50.442
I hope he lets us dance today.

10:50.443 --> 10:53.579
You may have a two-minute
dance block starting...

10:53.580 --> 10:54.580
Now.

10:54.581 --> 10:56.378
Yes!

10:56.379 --> 10:58.359
Dance.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.420
Dance.

11:02.383 --> 11:04.044
Dance...

11:04.045 --> 11:06.066
What is that awful sound?

11:06.067 --> 11:08.040
That's your latest hit single.

11:08.041 --> 11:12.449
How could anyone hear
this and not wanna dance?

11:12.450 --> 11:15.154
<i>♪ D-d-d-dance.</i>

11:15.155 --> 11:16.494
That is so gallifrax.

11:16.495 --> 11:19.315
<i>♪ D-d-d-dance.</i>

11:23.240 --> 11:25.428
We have to write a new
song for the festival.

11:25.429 --> 11:27.987
The one we heard in the
Mall isn't even music.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.168
It's just sounds.

11:29.169 --> 11:31.617
That's what music's
supposed to be.

11:31.618 --> 11:34.143
Random noise to
fill the silence.

11:34.144 --> 11:36.230
No, it's not.

11:36.231 --> 11:38.720
Music's supposed to
make you feel things.

11:38.721 --> 11:44.237
It doesn't make you dance like
you have water in your ears.

11:44.238 --> 11:47.898
It makes you dance like this.

11:50.268 --> 11:52.188
Whoa.

11:52.317 --> 11:55.562
What the heck was that?!

11:55.563 --> 11:58.811
That's me showing you how I
feel when I hear real music.

11:58.812 --> 12:04.272
Well, I guess we can try to
write something different.

12:04.682 --> 12:05.846
Here, what do you think?

12:05.847 --> 12:07.947
<i>♪ Move.</i>

12:08.380 --> 12:09.965
<i>♪ Move.</i>

12:09.966 --> 12:12.066
<i>♪ Move.</i>

12:12.392 --> 12:14.223
That's the same song we
heard at Future Mart.

12:14.224 --> 12:15.901
Austin, that one said...

12:15.902 --> 12:18.500
- Dance dance.
- And this one says...

12:18.501 --> 12:20.599
Move move.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.702
They're totally different.

12:22.703 --> 12:23.534
<i>♪ Move.</i>

12:23.535 --> 12:26.142
I don't wanna use the machine
to make music anymore.

12:26.143 --> 12:28.820
But people love the music
we make with the Tune-Pro.

12:28.821 --> 12:30.789
Jimmy's not gonna
wanna change that.

12:30.790 --> 12:32.712
Well, I'm gonna go talk to him.

12:32.713 --> 12:38.613
Trust me, there's a better way to make
music than the Tune-Pro 21 million.

12:41.116 --> 12:44.002
Jimmy, we need to talk. I
can't perform this music.

12:44.003 --> 12:48.023
It doesn't make
me wanna do this.

12:50.052 --> 12:52.153
Why would you wanna do that?

12:52.154 --> 12:55.496
Look, Austin, if you don't wanna
perform this music you don't have to.

12:55.497 --> 12:58.711
- I'll just replace you.
- Aw thanks Jimmy, I knew you'd understa...

12:58.712 --> 12:59.862
Wait, what?

12:59.863 --> 13:02.542
Austin, I'm gonna show
you the future of music.

13:02.543 --> 13:05.122
The Tune-Pro made
instruments unnecessary,

13:05.123 --> 13:08.609
and this is gonna make
performers unnecessary.

13:08.610 --> 13:11.610
Meet the Austin-Bot.

13:14.650 --> 13:16.570
Boom.

13:25.079 --> 13:30.029
- What do you think of my new ring?
- That is a nice shade of white.

13:30.030 --> 13:32.161
Oh. How did your
talk with Jimmy go?

13:32.162 --> 13:34.529
Not good. He's replacing
me with a robot.

13:34.530 --> 13:38.204
I saw him. He's even more
handsome than Austin.

13:38.205 --> 13:40.845
Dez, we look exactly the same.

13:40.846 --> 13:43.306
Sure you do.

13:43.881 --> 13:46.149
I'm sorry, Austin.

13:46.150 --> 13:49.771
So this Austin-Bot,
does he need a manager?

13:49.772 --> 13:51.474
The future stinks.

13:51.475 --> 13:55.188
The machines have ruined everything.
There's no color, there's no excitement.

13:55.189 --> 13:56.355
It's all the same.

13:56.356 --> 13:58.885
But that's how things
have always been.

13:58.886 --> 14:00.373
No, they haven't.

14:00.374 --> 14:01.847
And I'm gonna show you.

14:01.848 --> 14:04.977
Ally, we're gonna pull an all-nighter
and write a song the old-school way.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.818
- Grab the keyboard.
- I'm on it!

14:06.819 --> 14:08.960
What's a keyboard?

14:08.961 --> 14:11.721
It's this thing.

14:11.791 --> 14:13.197
I'm gonna teach you
how to play it.

14:13.198 --> 14:15.461
I'm gonna teach you all
how to play instruments.

14:15.462 --> 14:17.930
Can you teach me
how to play this?

14:17.931 --> 14:19.289
Dez, that's a ladder.

14:19.290 --> 14:22.950
Yes. But how do you play it?

14:23.991 --> 14:25.737
We'll get back to that.

14:25.738 --> 14:28.098
Trish, I need some colorful
clothes for my performance.

14:28.099 --> 14:30.087
Can you use that machine
at your job to make some?

14:30.088 --> 14:33.512
It's against the rules.
I'll get fired!

14:33.513 --> 14:35.887
I'm on it!

14:35.888 --> 14:39.785
Now Dez, I need you to stop the
Austin-Bot from performing.

14:39.786 --> 14:42.021
Use your giant arm
and crush him.

14:42.022 --> 14:43.630
I don't know if I can do that.

14:43.631 --> 14:45.147
What if he's stronger than me?

14:45.148 --> 14:46.395
What if he's faster than me?

14:46.396 --> 14:48.594
What if he's smarter than me?

14:48.595 --> 14:50.762
Buddy, I'm not gonna
lie to you...

14:50.763 --> 14:54.183
He's all of those things.

14:55.143 --> 14:58.323
So this is a C chord.

14:58.838 --> 15:01.613
And this is a D chord.

15:01.614 --> 15:05.994
- Yeah.
- With a little practice, you...

15:07.388 --> 15:09.355
Totally don't need my help.

15:09.356 --> 15:11.257
Whoa!

15:11.258 --> 15:13.567
What the heck was that?!

15:13.568 --> 15:16.117
That was you rockin'
the keyboard.

15:16.118 --> 15:18.364
I guess I've always
had this music in me.

15:18.365 --> 15:21.153
I just needed you
to bring it out.

15:21.154 --> 15:24.084
Now let's write a song. First we
have to come up with some chords.

15:24.085 --> 15:26.965
Oh, um, like this?

15:34.530 --> 15:36.843
That's great! Now let's
come up with some words.

15:36.844 --> 15:39.124
I got it!

15:39.568 --> 15:41.569
<i>♪ Dance.</i>

15:41.570 --> 15:43.471
<i>♪ Dance dance.</i>

15:43.472 --> 15:45.881
<i>- ♪Dance Dan...
- It can't just be any word!</i>

15:45.882 --> 15:47.886
They have to come
from your heart.

15:47.887 --> 15:51.789
What's the last powerful
emotion you experienced?

15:51.790 --> 15:53.710
Love.

15:55.167 --> 15:57.207
Really?

15:57.660 --> 16:02.333
Yeah. I was sitting next to you
at the keyboard and I thought...

16:02.334 --> 16:05.655
Man, I love this new
seat cushion I bought.

16:05.656 --> 16:08.356
It is so comfy.

16:08.753 --> 16:12.027
Okay, let's go with love then.

16:12.028 --> 16:13.628
What's great about love?

16:13.629 --> 16:15.284
Um...

16:15.285 --> 16:17.483
It doesn't fade over time.

16:17.484 --> 16:20.064
It's timeless?

16:23.356 --> 16:26.883
<i>♪ This love is never gonna fade.</i>

16:26.884 --> 16:28.940
<i>♪ We are timeless.</i>

16:28.941 --> 16:31.514
<i>♪ We are timeless.</i>

16:31.515 --> 16:33.531
That's incredible!

16:33.532 --> 16:38.135
Where did you learn how
to write songs that way?

16:38.136 --> 16:41.384
A good friend taught me.

16:41.385 --> 16:43.356
Was it Trish?

16:43.357 --> 16:45.157
No.

16:45.506 --> 16:48.086
Here, come on.

16:48.647 --> 16:51.167
Come on. Come on. Come on.

16:51.168 --> 16:53.688
Ah! Gallifrax!

16:57.237 --> 16:59.289
Ha, I just won again.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.346
It's not fair. You're a robot.

17:01.347 --> 17:04.741
You're, like, part-video game.

17:04.742 --> 17:05.852
Dez!

17:05.853 --> 17:08.400
You're supposed to crush him, not
let him crush your high score.

17:08.401 --> 17:10.402
I was going to, but...

17:10.403 --> 17:11.842
Then we started hanging out.

17:11.843 --> 17:14.506
He's like a cooler
version of you.

17:14.507 --> 17:19.127
Did you know he started
out as a toaster?

17:20.017 --> 17:22.237
What up?!

17:25.483 --> 17:28.851
Austin-Bot, you don't need to perform
for me tonight, I'm gonna do it myself.

17:28.852 --> 17:31.423
But this is Austin-Bot's
big big break.

17:31.424 --> 17:35.360
Burning toast is no longer
Austin-Bot's problem.

17:35.361 --> 17:37.529
But the fans are
expecting Austin Moon.

17:37.530 --> 17:39.264
There's only one real me.

17:39.265 --> 17:43.045
Austin-Bot is a better version.

17:43.335 --> 17:46.815
Oh, yeah? Can you do this?

17:56.867 --> 17:59.860
That was pretty good.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.586
I don't wanna have to do this.

18:01.587 --> 18:03.219
We're gonna have a dance-off.

18:03.220 --> 18:05.656
Dez, give me a beat.

18:05.657 --> 18:08.237

Don't leave me! You're
my best friend!

18:39.917 --> 18:42.407
Dez, that's the robot.

18:42.408 --> 18:44.508
I know.

18:51.968 --> 18:54.308
Austin-Bot.

18:54.653 --> 18:57.354
Nope. Jimmy, it's me.

18:57.355 --> 18:58.824
Austin Moon?

18:58.825 --> 19:00.653
I thought you didn't
want to perform.

19:00.654 --> 19:02.364
What on Mars is going on here?

19:02.365 --> 19:04.674
I'm gonna show the galaxy
the future of music.

19:04.675 --> 19:09.655
Well, it better be good.
The President is here.

19:14.122 --> 19:15.572
Time to take the stage.

19:15.573 --> 19:19.053
Ugh! This is so much work.

19:24.065 --> 19:26.585

20:55.771 --> 20:57.811
Austin.

20:59.188 --> 21:01.768
- That was amazing!
- Thanks.

21:01.769 --> 21:04.895
Guess we don't need
this Tune-Pro anymore.

21:04.896 --> 21:07.476
No, we don't.

21:13.141 --> 21:16.261
Austin, are you awake?

21:16.344 --> 21:18.278
What happened?

21:18.279 --> 21:20.712
Oh, man, I had the
craziest dream.

21:20.713 --> 21:25.185
You were there and you were there
and you were there and you...

21:25.186 --> 21:28.388
Never seen you
before in my life.

21:28.389 --> 21:30.126
That's the paramedic.

21:30.127 --> 21:33.193
He says you got a pretty nasty
shock from that stupid Tune-Pro.

21:33.194 --> 21:35.262
- But you'll be fine.
- Great.

21:35.263 --> 21:38.835
Ally, we gotta finish that song.
And we are not using the Tune-Pro.

21:38.836 --> 21:40.904
But I thought you
loved that thing.

21:40.905 --> 21:42.575
No, I hate it.

21:42.576 --> 21:45.975
One minute you're using a machine to
write a song, and the next minute,

21:45.976 --> 21:51.112
music's just a bunch of beeps and
boops and Nelson's President.

21:51.113 --> 21:54.918
Maybe we should get the
paramedic back here.

21:54.919 --> 21:57.783
- What did you dream about anyway?
- The future.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.571
I'll tell you all about it later,
but Ally and I have to get to work.

22:00.572 --> 22:02.180
But I have to hear
more about the future!

22:02.181 --> 22:04.940
Do I ever get a girlfriend? How many
Best Director Awards did I win?

22:04.941 --> 22:07.134
Does the Shirtnap ever take off?
What about the Tiekin?

22:07.135 --> 22:10.555
Are napkins still relevant?

22:13.861 --> 22:16.220
Come on, Dez, let's see it!

22:16.221 --> 22:17.542
What's he doing?

22:17.543 --> 22:20.081
He said the Invention
Convention inspired him.

22:20.082 --> 22:22.482
To do what?

22:22.741 --> 22:24.709
So, what do you think?

22:24.710 --> 22:27.338
All white clothes. Pretty...

22:27.339 --> 22:29.242
Fashion-forward, huh?

22:29.243 --> 22:30.498
Oh, no.

22:30.499 --> 22:32.062
Hey, check this out.

22:32.063 --> 22:37.763
A new fan from Iceland sent a
remix of your latest song.

22:41.890 --> 22:45.230
No. This can't be happening!

22:45.231 --> 22:49.008
Guess what! I just got
elected President!

22:49.009 --> 22:50.809
No!

22:54.705 --> 22:57.743
Funny, the Principal
had the same reaction.
