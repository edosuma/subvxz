KATY: Bye!

00:24.424 --> 00:27.260
Can't believe
your sister's still dating
these nut sacks.

00:27.293 --> 00:28.629
Wayne.
How're you now?

00:28.662 --> 00:29.730
KATY: Good and you?
Not so bad.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.097
Hi, Katy.
Go home, Daryl.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.836
Nice onesie.
Does it come in men's?

00:35.869 --> 00:38.071
Oh, I think you cum
in men enough for all of us.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.072
I think you better
come in my...

00:40.173 --> 00:41.542
I mean,
you better come...

00:41.575 --> 00:44.377
I think you better come say
that to his face,
you fucking hicks!

00:44.410 --> 00:46.346
Nice execution.
You're doin' terrific.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.314
Hey, I heard about
your break‐up, buddy.

00:48.348 --> 00:50.283
She was your sweetie
for five years, right?

00:50.316 --> 00:52.218
Your high school
sweetie, right?

00:52.252 --> 00:54.120
What's it to ya?
Heard she cheated
on you, buddy.

00:54.154 --> 00:55.355
That's a real kick
in the knackers, bro.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.157
Just a real ouchie, bro.

00:57.190 --> 00:59.292
It's too bad she taught you
not to fight anymore, buddy.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.461
'Cause that's a fight
on sight for you and
her new guy, buddy.

01:01.494 --> 01:03.530
Fourth line
for life, bro.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.132
Maybe, if you'd ever been
in a real fight, you might not
be so keen for another.

01:06.166 --> 01:06.767
What did you say?

01:07.634 --> 01:09.135
You heard me.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.504
Hold my spitter.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.806
Darts off, boys.

01:12.839 --> 01:14.374
You looking for
a tilly, buddy?

01:14.407 --> 01:16.409
Let's have a donnybrook.
DARYL: Pump the brakes.

01:16.442 --> 01:18.278
You take your shirt off,
but leave your sunglasses on?

01:18.311 --> 01:20.647
What sort of backwards fuckin'
pageantry is that?

01:20.681 --> 01:22.583
Do you want to fight
with those shades or play
pokerstars.com?

01:22.616 --> 01:24.384
Hold my spitter.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.852
Dude, I can't hold
your spitter.
You're holding
my spitter.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.487
Just put the
spitters down.
Tick‐tock.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.294
Go time!
Go time!

01:34.327 --> 01:36.229
Look at that fuckin'
treasure trail.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.264
WAYNE: What's up with your
fuckin' body hair, big shoots.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.166
You look like a
12‐year‐old Dutch girl.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.135
Your aesthetician quaff
that for you?

01:42.168 --> 01:43.403
DARYL: You can kiss
my ass‐thetician.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.872
You guys do cross fit?
You can cross‐fuck‐off.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.441
Cross fart. How many times
you pulled your
horn today, bud?

01:48.474 --> 01:49.710
What?
Oh, she's bashful.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.311
Oh, come on, kitten.
I won't tell anyone.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.547
Ball park six to eight?

01:53.580 --> 01:55.749
You're a fucking animal.
Play a little five on one.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.584
WAYNE: Hit the kitchen,
mix a batch.
DARYL: Feed the ducks.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.152
Distribute some
free literature.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.486
Go time!

02:00.521 --> 02:02.255
Fuckin'... Shed 'em!

02:02.288 --> 02:04.858
Riley! Jonesy! Put your
fuckin' shirts on!
Get outta here!

02:06.492 --> 02:09.195
BOTH: This isn't over!
Jinx. You owe me a Coke.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.531
Never buy you a Coke.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.905
It's a hard life pickin'
stones and pullin' teats

02:18.939 --> 02:22.709
but sure as God's got sandals
it beats fightin' dudes
with treasure trails.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.745
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:33.219 --> 02:34.788
Hi, Katy.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.623
We're out of yogurt.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.358
I brought some from home.

02:38.391 --> 02:39.726
KATY: So why didn't you
stay there and eat it.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.494
Mornin' Dary.
Mornin'.

02:44.397 --> 02:45.766
WAYNE: Thank you.
Welcome.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.701
So, you talked to Angie yet?

02:47.734 --> 02:49.970
It's been almost a month now.
Think you need to get
back on the horse.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.606
She stepped out on you.
Can't go back to that
and get any respect.

02:52.639 --> 02:53.807
Not in Letterkenny.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.408
Wayne, Angie did
you a lot of good.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.243
Somewhere along the way
you kinda got soft.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.679
You're not even
fighting anymore.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.514
You know what you need?
Sex. With a girl.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.549
Not just any girl.
A good Christian girl.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.817
I think I can help you.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.852
I've been going to the Burning
Bush Youth Group every Sunday.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.253
I think you should
come with me.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.755
I think you should
just eat your yogurt.

03:08.789 --> 03:09.856
There's millions
of starving kids
in the world.

03:09.890 --> 03:10.891
Yeah? Name ten.

03:21.434 --> 03:22.603
(SIGHS)

03:22.636 --> 03:23.870
You need a distraction.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.672
Something fun.
Look at this.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.977
It's called Tinder.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.346
Look, see there's all
these girls and if you
don't like one,

03:33.379 --> 03:35.315
you just say nope
and move onto the next.

03:35.348 --> 03:38.619
But if you do like one,
then you can see how
close they are

03:38.652 --> 03:39.986
and I don't know,
maybe meet up

03:40.020 --> 03:41.487
or whatever.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.357
So if you like 'em you just
type 'em out a message
or what's the scoop?

03:45.992 --> 03:47.794
Yeah. You just, you know,
say something like...

03:50.697 --> 03:53.967
Like, "On a scale of one
to America, how free
are you right now?"

03:58.605 --> 04:00.674
Oh, Jesus!
Look at these nut sacks.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.476
Why do you hate them so much?

04:03.510 --> 04:05.612
'Cause hockey players
would grab a monkey
by the tit if they could.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.582
Smokes are for jokes, bud!

Put it out before
it puts you out, bud!

(CHUCKLES)
Trash the ash, pal!

04:16.456 --> 04:18.424
Ouch! Put it out! Put it out!

04:18.458 --> 04:20.360
Put it out! Put it out!

04:21.862 --> 04:23.730
Tell the fish hook
story, Dan.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.566
It's really more
of a Wayne story.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.533
Yeah, but he
won't tell it.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.769
Oh, you've heard it
a baker's dozen times.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.403
Tell the story
or he won't shut up.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.005
DAN: Is there anymore
trail mix?

04:32.038 --> 04:33.006
It's in the house.

04:33.039 --> 04:35.509
Yous makes the most delicious
trail mix, Katy,

04:35.542 --> 04:38.478
and I got to say that's what
I appreciates about you.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.980
Is that what you
appreciate about me?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.782
Pitter‐patter, squirrely Dan.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.950
So, as the story goes,

04:43.984 --> 04:46.086
Wayne hucks an egg at a truck
with a Confederate flag

04:46.119 --> 04:47.688
in the back windshield

04:47.721 --> 04:49.055
and the driver's
fumin' pissed.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.492
So, we flee the scene
goin' full tilt like
a Peterbilt, right?

04:52.526 --> 04:55.762
Now, The Federales catch up
to us and chase us
through a few backyards

04:55.796 --> 04:57.931
before we scamper up
into some trees

04:57.964 --> 05:00.867
and all Wayne's got on
is a pair of
cut‐off jean shorts

05:00.901 --> 05:03.870
so he ain't exactly
super jazzed about the
situation, was you Wayne?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.672
Oh, I'm no DJ Jazzy Jeff.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.273
The Federale
pulls out his Taser,

05:07.307 --> 05:11.745
and he points it up at Wayne
and says some real
Clint Eastwood‐sounding shit.

05:11.778 --> 05:13.213
He says to Wayne, he says,

05:13.246 --> 05:17.350
"If I'd known I was going to
run into some uptown
street toughs today,

05:17.383 --> 05:19.052
"I'd have done up
my top button."

05:19.085 --> 05:20.987
(CHUCKLES) That's from
a John Wayne motion picture.

05:21.021 --> 05:21.922
No, Cool Hand Luke.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.090
Pert near anything
Kevin Costner, really.

05:24.124 --> 05:27.928
Either way, I's impressed
and I'd let out
an audible gasp

05:27.961 --> 05:32.065
so he hears me, spins around,
aims the Taser up at me
and lets fire,

05:32.098 --> 05:34.635
and if that thing doesn't
latch onto my nipple ring,

05:34.668 --> 05:36.870
which I'm pretty sure
amplified the
electric current,

05:36.903 --> 05:38.672
he sent coursing through
my entire body.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.007
And they just walked over
and yanked that thing
out of my nipple

05:41.041 --> 05:42.809
like it was a goddamn
fish hook.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.511
At least that's
according to my cousin.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.946
Well, you know,
my second cousin.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.881
Who, Garrett?
No, Jarrett.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.583
Huh...
I cried.

05:49.616 --> 05:50.951
I'm not even ashamed
to admit that.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.919
(BURPS)

05:52.953 --> 05:54.755
That was well brought up.
Too bad you weren't.

05:54.788 --> 05:55.822
I should say.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.625
Thirsty Thursdays, boys.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.861
Might as well get balls
deep in a bottle of
Gus'n Bru tonight.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.699
It's a four leaf clover.
Make a wish.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.668
Wish you weren't so
fucking awkward, bud.

a peek‐see, Wayne.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.618
GAIL: How are yous?
WAYNE: Not too bad.

06:24.651 --> 06:27.554
Good. And you?
Not too bad.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.823
Smells like someone's
in their barn clothes.

Four shots of Gus'n Bru,
please and thank you,

06:32.526 --> 06:33.694
One for you, too,
Gailor.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.962
Thank you, Wayne,
but I'm off the sauce.

vitamin D,

and two Cold‐FX's.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.509
Yeah, but 'cept
how many darts though?

06:48.542 --> 06:49.610
Twenty, 25 darts.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.844
Oh, you got
'er down then?

06:50.877 --> 06:52.012
Last I seen ya,
you were on a pack
and a half of smokes.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.980
Well, sometimes,
I'll have a pack
and a half of smokes,

06:54.014 --> 06:55.181
but never more than
two packs of smokes.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.783
Good enough.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.187
All right. Won't be rude.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.525
I'd hang a piss.

and leprechaun
buckles on his shoes.

Driving a '94 Jeep YJ
with a wave decal on the side.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.919
Enough cologne to offend
a Bangkok lady boy.

Good enough.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.188
Do you want to hear
the best part?

07:35.221 --> 07:37.090
You really wanna
hear the best part.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.892
Okay.

for fuck's sake.

07:52.606 --> 07:53.607
Just fuckin' look, Wayne.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.978
Full Bieber eyes.
What's that?

07:59.212 --> 08:01.147
Bieber. The pop star.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.949
I'm not familiar
with his work.

Get outta the way,
I'm growing a tail.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.552
Wayne, I would like
to cordially invite you to
the Burning Bush Youth Group

08:38.585 --> 08:40.654
this Sunday, for an
evening of song and praise.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.690
Hard no.
My sweetie, Margaret,
is a first class gal.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.592
She's got some friends
she can introduce you to.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.629
Margaret? Sounds like
a biddy old blue‐hair'd.

08:48.662 --> 08:52.899
She's not. She's a very
focused young woman on the
path to eternity with Christ.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.868
And which part
of that appeals to you?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.972
I like singing the songs.
KATY: Sort yourself out.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.209
You're a pervert, Daryl.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.779
Jesus, your breath could stop
a Mack truck right now.

09:05.812 --> 09:06.947
All right, cool it.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.717
What say, we go for
a quick ice run, Wayne?

09:10.751 --> 09:13.086
I'm pushing up on you
for years now.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.822
What's say you give
old Gailor one for
the scrapbook?

09:15.856 --> 09:16.890
Huh?
