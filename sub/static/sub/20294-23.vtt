WAY BEFORE THEN.

06:26.067 --> 06:28.933
-YOU KNOW ME, THOUGH, BRO.
-I KNOW, AND I WASN'T
EXPECTING THAT.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.567

06:45.933 --> 06:47.900
-WHAT IS THAT, MISDEMEANOR?
-WHAT? THE RESIST?

06:48.067 --> 06:50.300
YES, IT'S JUST A MISDEMEANOR.
-WHY WOULD YOU BE CHARGING

I GREW UP IN BOISE

07:08.467 --> 07:11.133
I FEEL LIKE IT'S A TOWN--
IT'S NOT TOO BIG,
IT'S NOT TOO SMALL,

07:11.233 --> 07:15.900
AND IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO WORK
AND BE A PATROL OFFICER.

07:16.067 --> 07:19.333
-WE'RE HEADING TO A VERBAL
DOMESTIC IN PROGRESS.

07:19.433 --> 07:22.600

08:02.567 --> 08:04.567
AND STARTED SHOVING THEM
IN MY FACE.

08:04.667 --> 08:07.167
-WHEN YOU SAY SHOVING THEM
IN YOUR FACE, WHAT IS...?

08:07.267 --> 08:09.067
-TAKING THEM AND PUSHING THEM
INTO MY TEETH.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.467
-SO, I MEAN, DID IT ACTUALLY HIT
YOUR TEETH, OR DID IT...?

08:11.567 --> 08:13.400
-JUST RUBBING UP
AGAINST MY MOUTH,

08:13.500 --> 08:15.800
LIKE HE WAS TRYING, YOU KNOW...

08:15.900 --> 08:18.067
-OKAY. JUST TO CLARIFY FOR TODAY
WHAT HAPPENED...

08:18.133 --> 08:21.567
HE WAS SHOVING THE REMOTE
IN YOUR FACE AND IT HIT YOUR
TEETH-- DID IT HIT YOUR LIPS?

08:21.667 --> 08:24.533
-HE GRABBED MY ARMS
AND HE HIT MY JAW.

08:24.633 --> 08:27.333
-AND HE HIT YOUR JAW?
HOW DID HE HIT YOUR JAW?

08:27.433 --> 08:29.233

08:42.967 --> 08:44.833
AND HE'LL BE FINE TOMORROW.
-OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH.

08:44.933 --> 08:47.267
IF YOU WANT TO JUST STAND
OUTSIDE WITH THESE OFFICERS,
I'LL BE WITH YOU...

08:47.367 --> 08:49.067
I'LL BE BACK OUT HERE
IN JUST A MINUTE.

08:49.100 --> 08:50.300
-ALL RIGHT.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.700
-I'M IN HERE IN MY UNDERWEAR--
-OKAY. SHH, SHH, SHH!

08:52.800 --> 08:54.733
ARE YOU GOING TO TALK TO ME
FOR A SEC, STEVE?

08:54.833 --> 08:57.067
I'M OFFICER MARTINEZ.
-ABSOLUTELY MARTINEZ.

08:57.100 --> 09:00.067
-OKAY--
-I AM NOT
AN AGGRESSIVE PERSON...

09:00.133 --> 09:01.700
-DO YOU MIND SHUTTING
THAT DOOR, CHRIS?

09:01.800 --> 09:04.200
-I AM 27 YEARS
INTO THE MARRIAGE THAT...

09:04.300 --> 09:05.233
-OKAY. OKAY.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.567
-I'VE SUPPORTED A STEPSON.
-MM-HMM.

09:07.667 --> 09:10.733
-I'VE HAD FOUR STEPFATHERS.
-MM-HMM.

09:10.833 --> 09:14.433
-AND MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER--
-OKAY. I GOT A COUPLE THINGS
I NEED TO ASK--

09:14.533 --> 09:16.600
-I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN.
-YOU CAN SIT DOWN. THAT'S FINE.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.667
-I HAVE NO WEAPONS.
-JUST RIGHT THERE.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.733
-HEY, NO. DON'T DO THAT.
-OKAY. JUST HAVE A SEAT
RIGHT HERE.

09:20.833 --> 09:23.500
-YOU WANT TO SEE--
-SIR, WHY DON'T YOU JUST HAVE
A SEAT RIGHT HERE FOR NOW?

09:23.600 --> 09:25.367
-DAMN IT!
DON'T TREAT ME LIKE THAT.
-JUST RELAX--

09:25.467 --> 09:26.933
-I'M TRYING TO HELP
YOU OUT, SIR.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.400
-I DON'T HAVE ANY
GOD DAMN WEAPONS ON ME.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.867
-DO YOU WANT TO TALK
TO ME OR NOT?
-I DO. I DO.

09:30.967 --> 09:34.133
-THEN RELAX FOR A SECOND.
-OKAY, BUT DON'T DO
THAT (bleep). PLEASE?

09:34.233 --> 09:37.100
-LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T CALM DOWN,
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PUT YOU
IN HANDCUFFS RIGHT NOW.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.867
-DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
-I DO.

09:38.967 --> 09:41.933
-SO RELAX FOR A SECOND.
-BUT... DON'T DO THIS.

09:42.067 --> 09:44.700
-THEN SIT DOWN AND LET'S TALK.
-THIS IS WHAT MY STEPDAD DID.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.700
-THEN WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN
AND WE CAN TALK FOR A SECOND.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.467
-I'LL BE HAPPY TO DO THAT.
-THANK YOU.

09:48.567 --> 09:52.400
-GO AHEAD AND HAVE A SEAT.
-YOU'RE IN A UNIFORM,
I'M IN MY GOD DAMN UNDERPANTS.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.533
-ARE YOU GOING TO TALK
TO ME OR NOT, STEVE?
-I WILL.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.600
-OKAY. WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT--
-THE ANSWER'S YES.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.733
I'LL SIT DOWN,
BUT DON'T DISRESPECT ME.

09:59.833 --> 10:03.000
-I WON'T--
-WE'LL DO WHAT WE NEED
TO DO. OKAY?

10:03.100 --> 10:05.400
-I WON'T DISRESPECT YOU.
-I WILL SIT DOWN.

10:05.500 --> 10:09.367
-THANK YOU. HE'S NO DIFFERENT
THAN ME, STEVE. JUST TALK
TO HIM LIKE--

10:09.467 --> 10:12.633
-I KNOW THAT!
THIS IS REALLY NICE!

10:12.733 --> 10:14.433
-OKAY. I HAVE
A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU--

10:14.533 --> 10:16.833
-I GOT SUITS
AND I GOT NICE DRESS CLOTHES,

10:16.933 --> 10:19.767
BUT I'LL TALK TO YOU
IN MY (bleep) UNDERWEAR.

10:19.867 --> 10:21.367
-I HAVE A COUPLE
QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

10:21.467 --> 10:24.967
-SHOOT. MAKE 'EM CLEAR,
MAKE 'EM DIRECT
AND DON'T BULL (bleep).

10:25.067 --> 10:27.100
-OKAY. THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.567
-SO I TALKED TO YOUR WIFE. OKAY?

10:28.667 --> 10:30.900
-(slurring words)
-YEP.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.733
-YOU TALKED TO MY WIFE.
-SHE'S NOT WANTING TO PRESS
CHARGES ON YOU. OKAY?

10:34.833 --> 10:39.533
-THEN THAT'S HER CHOICE.
SHE CAN GO ANY DIRECTION.
I DON'T GIVE A (bleep).

10:39.633 --> 10:44.267
-BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I TALK
TO YOU TO KIND OF GET THE STORY
OF WHAT'S GOING ON TONIGHT.

10:44.367 --> 10:47.033
-GO AHEAD.
-BECAUSE SHE DID TELL ME
ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU TOOK

10:47.133 --> 10:50.167
THE FOUR DIFFERENT REMOTES
AND WERE SHOVING THEM
IN HER FACE TONIGHT.

10:50.267 --> 10:53.700
-SHE MENTIONED GETTING HIT.
SHE SAID THAT YOU SLAPPED HER
IN THE JAW TODAY.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.333
-HOW HARD DID YOU HIT HER?
ARE WE TALKING
JUST BARELY, OR...?

10:56.433 --> 10:59.833
-I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU...
-OKAY.

11:00.067 --> 11:02.167
-GO ASK HER.
-I JUST DID.

11:02.267 --> 11:08.500
-SHE WANTS TO HIT ME ONCE,
I PUT THE REMOTE AND I DID
THIS ON HER CHIN.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.433
-I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE FRUSTRATED,

11:10.533 --> 11:14.733
BUT YOU CANNOT TAKE IT OUT
PHYSICALLY AGAINST YOUR WIFE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

11:14.833 --> 11:16.900
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO PRESS
CHARGES ON YOU--

11:17.067 --> 11:19.167
-IF SHE HITS ME FIRST--
-SHE DIDN'T WANT TO PRESS
CHARGES ON YOU,

11:19.267 --> 11:21.133
BUT, LISTEN, LISTEN.
-OKAY.

11:21.233 --> 11:24.133
-BUT I AM GOING TO PRESS
CHARGES ON YOU--
-GO AHEAD!

11:24.233 --> 11:25.967
-AND SO YOU ARE UNDER ARREST
FOR DOMESTIC BATTERY.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.767
-GREAT!
-I NEED YOU TO STAND UP.

11:27.867 --> 11:29.667
-CAN I...?
-NOPE. STAND UP.

11:29.767 --> 11:32.600
-PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND
YOUR BACK.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.233
JUST RELAX.
-CAN I PUT SOME PANTS ON?

11:35.333 --> 11:39.533
-WELL, SHE HIT ME
THE FIRST TIME--
-ARE YOU AFRAID OF YOUR WIFE?

11:39.633 --> 11:41.900
-YOU KNOW,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU...

11:42.067 --> 11:45.300
-WE GOT SOME SHORTS HERE.
WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU GET
YOUR SHORTS ON HERE, REAL QUICK.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.067
-I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
-IF YOU WANT TO GRAB THAT SIDE.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.067
-THERE YOU GO.
-AT LEAST I GET
SOME PROTECTION, RIGHT?

11:51.167 --> 11:55.233
-THAT'S RIGHT.
HELP YOU GET DRESSED
AND EVERYTHING.

11:55.333 --> 11:58.367
-OKAY, I NEED...
-THERE YOU GO. I GOT YOU.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.233
-I APPRECIATE IT.
-YEP.

12:00.333 --> 12:03.067
-(indistinct)

12:03.100 --> 12:04.700
-AM I DOING OKAY?

12:04.800 --> 12:06.833
-ALL RIGHT, WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
GO DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

12:06.933 --> 12:10.700
WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET HURT ON OUR WALK.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.200
-THANKS.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.767
-LET'S NOT BE TALKING
WITH HER AT ALL.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.767
-I LOVE YOU.
-COME ON, MAN.

12:15.867 --> 12:17.400
-OKAY, WHERE AM I?

12:17.500 --> 12:18.967
-JUST STICK YOUR REAR
END FIRST, OKAY?

12:19.067 --> 12:20.700
-I DID NOT DO
A GOOD JOB.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.333
-HAVE A SEAT, BUD.
-IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE...

12:22.433 --> 12:23.833
-YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

12:23.933 --> 12:25.200
I'M SURE IT HAS BEEN.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.233
NOT IN YOUR TRAINING, RIGHT?

12:27.333 --> 12:28.967
-IT'S USUALLY EASIER
WITH YOUR--

12:29.067 --> 12:30.300
-YEAH, I'LL HANDLE IT.
-YOU GOT IT?

12:30.400 --> 12:31.500
ALL RIGHT.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.300
-I NEED TO GET PAST
THIS HARD (bleep) PLASTIC.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.133
APPRECIATE YOUR NICE HANDCUFFS.

12:37.233 --> 12:40.333
-OKAY, LIKE I SAID,
IF YOU KEEP YOUR FEET TOWARDS
THE DOOR, THAT'S GONNA BE THE--

12:40.433 --> 12:42.233
-ALL RIGHT.
-BEST ON YOUR HANDS, ALL RIGHT?

12:42.333 --> 12:46.367
-IT'S THE GODDAMN MOST
COMFORTABLE CAB RIDE
I'VE EVER HAD.

12:46.467 --> 12:49.833
-YOUR HUSBAND IS ACTUALLY
BEING ARRESTED FOR
DOMESTIC BATTERY.

12:49.933 --> 12:51.867
AND I MADE IT
PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM

12:51.967 --> 12:54.100
THAT THIS IS NOT YOU
PRESSING CHARGES ON HIM.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.400
I TOLD HIM THAT THIS IS
US PRESSING CHARGES ON HIM.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.400
-YEAH.
-I TOLD HIM THAT YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.967
-RIGHT. NOT IN ANY WAY,
SHAPE, OR FORM.

13:02.067 --> 13:04.633
-BUT I'M SEEING THE DOMESTIC
BATTERY GOING ON, SO...

13:04.733 --> 13:06.767
-I'M ALMOST SORRY
I DIALED YOU GUYS.

13:06.867 --> 13:10.633
-WELL--
-ALL I WANTED HIM TO DO WAS
GO TO BED AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

13:10.733 --> 13:15.367
-YEAH, WELL, ULTIMATELY
OUR GOAL IS NOT FOR YOU GUYS
TO GET SPLIT UP

13:15.467 --> 13:16.567
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.067
OUR GOAL IS FOR YOU
NOT TO BE LIVING IN FEAR,

13:19.133 --> 13:21.067
AND FOR YOU NOT TO BE
GETTING BATTERED
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.933
THAT'S REALLY
THE ULTIMATE GOAL.

13:24.767 --> 13:28.367
-I GREW UP IN A NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT'S HISTORICALLY ONE OF
THE ROUGHER AREAS OF TOWN.

13:28.467 --> 13:33.067
BUT LUCKILY FOR ME
MY PARENTS WERE ALWAYS
KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON ME

13:33.167 --> 13:34.733
AND MAKING SURE
I STAYED OUT OF TROUBLE.

13:34.833 --> 13:38.933
AND HERE I AM NOW,
WORKING FOR THE CITY
I GREW UP IN.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.667
I HOLD THIS CITY
CLOSE TO MY HEART, SO...

13:41.767 --> 13:45.233
THERE'S A GREEN CAR
DOING DOUGHNUTS BEHIND US.

13:45.333 --> 13:49.933
I'LL TRY TO CATCH UP TO HIM.
HE'S DRIVING REALLY FAST
IN THIS RESIDENTIAL AREA.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.667
WHERE'D HE GO?

13:55.700 --> 13:56.900
WHERE ALL THAT
DIRT'S AT, PROBABLY?

13:57.067 --> 13:58.867
THERE HE IS.
HE 901'D.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.200
HE CRASHED.

14:07.867 --> 14:10.767
16, I JUST--
I'M AT A 901.

14:10.867 --> 14:14.067
I JUST SAW A GUY
DOING DOUGHNUTS.
HE 901'D INTO A TREE.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.400
YOU REGRET THAT, OR WHAT?

14:19.500 --> 14:20.500
-YEAH.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.167
-ARE YOU HURT?
-HUH?

14:22.267 --> 14:24.067
-ARE YOU HURT?

14:24.100 --> 14:25.233
-NO.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.967
-YOU BEEN DRINKING?

14:27.067 --> 14:28.833
IS EVERYBODY OKAY OVER THERE?

14:31.900 --> 14:34.333
YOU GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET OUT, DUDE?
-YEAH.

14:34.433 --> 14:36.067
CAN I JUST SMOKE
THIS CIGARETTE?

14:37.600 --> 14:39.133
-ARE YOU HURT?
-NO.

14:40.533 --> 14:42.133
-YOU DON'T HAVE ANY WEAPONS
IN HERE, DO YOU?
-NO.

14:42.233 --> 14:43.300
-LET ME SEE YOUR HAND, DUDE.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.633
-I JUST WANT TO LIGHT
THIS CIGARETTE, DUDE.

14:44.733 --> 14:46.600
THAT'S IT.

14:46.700 --> 14:47.900
-TURN AROUND,
TURN AROUND, TURN AROUND.

14:48.067 --> 14:48.933
-CAN I LIGHT
THIS CIGARETTE?

14:49.067 --> 14:50.200
-HANG ON, BUD.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.633
LET ME MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
GOT ANY WEAPONS ON YOU.

14:51.733 --> 14:53.100
-I DON'T. I REALLY DON'T.
-SPREAD YOUR FEET.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.067
SPREAD YOUR FEET.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.767
LOOK WHAT YOU JUST DID
TO THAT HOUSE, MAN!

15:02.533 --> 15:04.267
IS EVERYBODY OKAY OVER THERE?

15:04.367 --> 15:05.533
-YES!

15:05.633 --> 15:07.167
-YOU GUYS ALL OKAY?

15:07.267 --> 15:08.200
-YEAH.

15:08.300 --> 15:09.967
LOOK WHAT YOU DID
TO THAT HOUSE.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.900
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, MAN?

15:16.633 --> 15:19.067
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
-STEVEN.

15:19.133 --> 15:20.900
-YOU ON PROBATION OR PAROLE?
-NO.

15:21.067 --> 15:22.767
YOU JUST TALKED
TO ME LAST NIGHT.

15:22.867 --> 15:25.233
-YOU'RE THE ONE I STOPPED
LAST NIGHT?
-YEAH.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.533
-WITH HIS NINE DOLLAR
AN HOUR JOB, HE'S NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO--

15:29.633 --> 15:31.333
-YOU GOT INSURANCE
ON THIS THING?

15:31.433 --> 15:32.633
-YUP.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.067
-YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT.

15:36.133 --> 15:37.733
-YOU KNOW SOMEBODY
RIGHT THERE, OR WHAT?

15:37.833 --> 15:40.067
-I USED TO LIVE IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD. I KNOW EVERYBODY
AROUND HERE, MAN.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.533
-ALL RIGHT, MAN.

15:41.633 --> 15:43.800
-THE PERSON THAT LIVES
IN THIS HOUSE, YEAH,
I DON'T KNOW THEM, BUT--

15:43.900 --> 15:46.133
-I GOT AN AMBULANCE ON THE WAY.
THEY'RE GONNA CHECK YOU OUT,
ALL RIGHT?

15:46.233 --> 15:47.467
-ALL RIGHT.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.233
-HURTING ANYWHERE?
-NO.

15:51.067 --> 15:54.233
-OH, STEVEN.

THE DOUGHNUTS OVER THERE.
-I KNOW.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.433
-YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DRINKING,
HAVE YOU?
-NO.

16:00.533 --> 16:02.567
CAN I LIGHT MY CIGARETTE
REAL QUICK?

16:02.667 --> 16:05.400
-HANG ON, BUD.
-PLEASE.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.100
-I GOTTA TALK TO THESE PEOPLE.
I CAN'T JUST--

16:07.200 --> 16:08.700

-UNCUFF YOU RIGHT NOW.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.867
-I KNOW, I'M NOT--
-YOU'RE GONNA GO
IN THE BACK SEAT FOR A BIT.

16:10.967 --> 16:12.133
-CAN YOU LIGHT IT FOR ME?

16:12.233 --> 16:14.600
-NOT IN THE BACK SEAT.
YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN MY CAR.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.833
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT HURT?
-NO, I'M ALL RIGHT.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.467
-WE GOT AN AMBULANCE ANYWAY.
IT'S COMING ON THE WAY,
ALL RIGHT?

16:20.567 --> 16:22.167
(siren blares)

16:22.267 --> 16:24.767
-LET'S JUST BE THANKFUL
NO ONE'S HURT, STEVEN,
ALL RIGHT?

16:24.867 --> 16:27.067
-HEY, SUCKER.

16:27.133 --> 16:28.567
-IS THIS YOUR HOUSE, PARTNER?

16:28.667 --> 16:31.433
-YOU'RE (bleep) LUCKY
YOU DIDN'T HURT ONE OF
MY FAMILY MEMBERS.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.200
-I DIDN'T--
-YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:33.300 --> 16:35.400
-I RAN THAT STOP SIGN.
-I DON'T GIVE A (bleep)
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.200
BUT IF THAT WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED,
-I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.400
-I'D HUNT YOU DOWN UNTIL
THE DAY I (bleep) GOT YOU.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.067
-I KNOW.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.433
I USED TO LIVE RIGHT HERE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, MAN.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.067
-YOU'RE VERY LUCKY, MAN.

16:47.167 --> 16:50.733
HE SAYS HE'S FINE, BUT IF
YOU GUYS CAN JUST CHECK ON HIM
REAL QUICK ANYWAYS.

16:52.067 --> 16:53.567
-WHAT'S GOING ON, BUDDY?

16:53.667 --> 16:55.333
-STAND UP MAN,
I'LL LET YOU TAKE
YOUR CUFFS OFF.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.667
-GOT ANY PAIN ANYWHERE?

16:57.767 --> 16:58.800
-CAN I SMOKE
A CIGARETTE?

16:58.900 --> 17:00.067
-DOES IT HURT BACK HERE AT ALL?
-NO.

17:00.167 --> 17:01.967
-LET THEM DEAL WITH YOU
FOR A MINUTE.

17:02.067 --> 17:03.667
-NOTHING?
-DON'T GO RUNNING
OR ANYTHING ON ME, DUDE.

17:03.767 --> 17:04.967
-NO, I'M NOT.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.500
-PUT THAT HAND ON YOUR HEAD.
-I HAD MY SEAT BELT ON.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.300
-OKAY.
-HOW FAST WERE
YOU GOING?

17:08.400 --> 17:11.500
-I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.567
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.433
-WELL, HE PULLED THE DOOR OPEN.
I KNEW HE WAS COMING.

17:18.533 --> 17:19.933
IS MY FACE ALL LIKE THAT?

17:20.067 --> 17:21.300
-NO.
-(laughing)

17:21.400 --> 17:22.733

17:27.833 --> 17:29.333
-I JUST WANT A CIGARETTE.

17:31.733 --> 17:33.233
-THAT'S GONNA HOLD OFF
FOR A MINUTE, MAN.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.133
YOU'RE GONNA GO
WITH THEM?

17:35.233 --> 17:36.867
-I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW.

17:36.967 --> 17:39.467
-'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FOLLOW EITHER WAY.

17:39.567 --> 17:41.333
I GOT A UNIT ON THE WAY.
-CAN I GRAB MY MONEY?

17:41.433 --> 17:42.900
-HANG ON.

17:43.067 --> 17:47.100
WAIT 'TIL WE GOT
ONE OTHER UNIT ON THE WAY,

17:47.200 --> 17:48.633
THEN I'LL DEAL WITH THAT.

17:48.733 --> 17:50.067
I'LL GET ALL YOUR STUFF,

17:50.133 --> 17:53.167
-WHATEVER. I FEEL SOMETHING'S

17:53.267 --> 17:55.800

17:55.900 --> 17:58.067
-OKAY. I'MMA GET YOU

17:58.133 --> 17:59.500
-I-- WELL,
I JUST WANT A CIGARETTE.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.933
-CLEARLY.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.967
-WELL, WE HAVE OXYGEN.
WE CAN'T HAVE YOU SMOKING
IN THERE.

18:03.067 --> 18:04.567
-YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO SMOKE.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.467
-(indistinct)

18:06.567 --> 18:07.967
-I DON'T KNOW.
I (bleep) UP THEIR HOUSE, MAN,

18:08.067 --> 18:09.533
AND I DON'T NEED
A BIGGER BILL.

18:09.633 --> 18:11.767
I DON'T NEED
A BIGGER BILL, MAN.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.533
-HE SAYS HE TOOK THAT TURN
ABOUT 70 MILES AN HOUR.

18:16.633 --> 18:17.567
-THAT WAS WAY FASTER.

18:17.667 --> 18:18.933
-YEAH?
-I HEARD IT.

18:19.067 --> 18:20.300
-EITHER WAY, I MEAN--

18:20.400 --> 18:22.167
EITHER WAY'S TOO FAST
COMING AROUND THAT CORNER
LIKE THAT.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.333
-YEAH. I WAS SITTING IN
THE HOUSE UP AGAINST
THIS WALL

18:25.433 --> 18:26.900
ON THE COUCH
WATCHING TV.

18:27.067 --> 18:30.200
AND I HEARD SCREECHING.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.067
AND APPARENTLY
IT GOT CLOSE.

18:32.133 --> 18:36.133
I COULD FEEL IT ON THE GROUND
WHEN HE HIT THE SIDEWALK

18:36.233 --> 18:37.900
AND CAME UP ON THE GROUND.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.067
AND AS SOON AS
HE HIT THIS,

18:40.100 --> 18:41.533
I SEEN DIRT
HITTING THE WINDOW,

18:41.633 --> 18:44.400
AND I YELLED AT MY DAUGHTER,
TOLD HER TO GET IN THE KITCHEN.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.800
AND... YEAH.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.800
I JUST GOT... SHOOKEN UP.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.433
-GLAD YOU GUYS
ARE ALL ALL RIGHT THOUGH.

18:51.533 --> 18:52.900
WAS ANYBODY
ON THE PORCH?
-NO.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.867
FORTUNATELY. THAT'S WHERE
THEY ALL SIT, RIGHT THERE, MAN.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.700
IT WOULD HAVE
TOOK THEIR LEGS OFF.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.767
-DID YOU GUYS SEE
WHAT HAPPENED?
-NO.

18:59.867 --> 19:01.967
-YOU GUYS HEAR IT?
-HEARD IT, YEAH.

19:02.067 --> 19:03.833
'CAUSE I WAS RIGHT THERE
WHERE THAT AIR CONDITIONER IS.

19:03.933 --> 19:05.067
-WHO WAS ALL INSIDE?

19:05.133 --> 19:07.367
-MY DAUGHTER, MY SON,
AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

19:07.467 --> 19:10.100
IF HE WOULD HAVE GOT ONE OF
MY FAMILY MEMBERS, I WOULD HAVE
HUNTED HIM DOWN.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.800
-YEAH, I BELIEVE YOU.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.700
ALL RIGHT, STEVEN, SO...

19:18.800 --> 19:22.267
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR.
FOR THE RECKLESS.

19:22.367 --> 19:24.467
YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID
TO THE HOUSE.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.367
THAT'S A REAL--
I WAS JUST TALKING TO THEM,

19:26.467 --> 19:28.567
A REALLY NICE FAMILY, TOO.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.533
-I BELIEVE IT.
THE GUY'S GOT HEART.

19:30.633 --> 19:33.133
HE CAME OUT
AND THREATENED ME STRAIGHT OUT.
-YEAH.

19:33.233 --> 19:34.733
YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH HE CARED
ABOUT HIS FAMILY.

19:34.833 --> 19:36.533
HE'S GOT HIS GRANDDAUGHTER
THERE AND EVERYTHING.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.600
-I HAVE NO...
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

19:39.700 --> 19:41.067
I-- I'M SORRY.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.900
-YEAH. THIS IS A BUMP
IN THE ROAD,

19:43.067 --> 19:44.600
BUT HOPEFULLY
AN EYE-OPENER FOR YOU.
-YEAH.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.833
-I JUST WISH YOU WOULD HAVE
MADE A BETTER DECISION TONIGHT.

19:46.933 --> 19:48.467
TAKE CARE.

19:49.733 --> 19:50.767
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.433
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:52.533 --> 19:54.200
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.233
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.300
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.600 --> 20:05.533
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:05.633 --> 20:07.133
-(theme music playing)
