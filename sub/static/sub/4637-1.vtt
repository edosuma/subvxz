01:19.896 --> 01:21.363
You tell me what that is.

01:23.099 --> 01:25.499
You stay right there. I'll be back.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.233
- Hi, Bernice.
- Miss Olivia.

01:33.409 --> 01:35.673
Hey, you be a good girl.
I'll see you after work.

01:35.845 --> 01:36.834
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.503
Bye.

01:38.948 --> 01:41.178
Bobby, get up.

02:04.674 --> 02:06.642
Eight-thirty?

02:07.143 --> 02:09.338
Get out of here. Go on.

02:09.746 --> 02:12.214
Go on. Get.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.783
Look at you.

02:15.952 --> 02:18.352
Hey, look at your friend there.

02:19.289 --> 02:22.019
Ma, why didn't you even
wake me up?

02:22.192 --> 02:24.558
I should body-slam him.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.424
Hey, man, can...?

02:53.756 --> 02:56.122
- Good morning, Donna.
- Good morning, Mr. Tinsdale.

02:56.292 --> 02:57.691
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

02:57.861 --> 02:59.328
- Have a nice day.
Waymon.

02:59.495 --> 03:01.087
- David.
- Donna.

03:07.837 --> 03:09.771
Drake, Gearson & Burke,
may I help you?

03:09.939 --> 03:11.770
- What was that all about?
- No big deal.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.240
- I thought you two were an item.
- She just couldn't cut it, that's all.

03:15.411 --> 03:16.708
Yeah, right.

03:18.414 --> 03:19.403
Sheila, good morning.

03:19.582 --> 03:22.210
Have my presentation materials
come up from the mailroom?

03:22.385 --> 03:25.286
- Not yet.
- Not yet? Call the mailroom.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.855
How about the conference room?
Have they got chairs?

03:28.024 --> 03:30.288
The audio-visual.
Have they set up the projector?

03:30.460 --> 03:32.951
Waymon, will you relax?
I've taken care of everything.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.063
This is the biggest deal
of my career.

03:35.231 --> 03:38.723
I'm aware of that. Why do you think
I've been here since 6:30 this morning?

03:38.902 --> 03:41.393
- Get going. Atwell is waiting.
- Thank you.

03:41.571 --> 03:44.199
- Good luck.
- Won't need it.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.875
Oh, are you okay?
Can I help you with something?

03:53.049 --> 03:55.483
I fell for you, babe.
How about lunch this afternoon?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.517
You've got to be kidding.

03:57.687 --> 03:59.621
How about dinner tonight?

03:59.856 --> 04:02.723
Okay, lunch tomorrow?

04:02.892 --> 04:05.156
How about a frank right now?

04:05.328 --> 04:07.319
Slice of pizza?

04:09.732 --> 04:11.131
Well, well, well.

04:11.301 --> 04:12.859
Hey, hey.

04:13.269 --> 04:15.601
- What happened last night?
- Don't know about you...

04:15.772 --> 04:17.865
...brothers like me
gotta work in the morning.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.805
- You see I'm in the house.
- Yeah, but you late in the house.

04:20.976 --> 04:23.844
- Hey, but I'm in here.
- I don't see how you do it, man.

04:24.013 --> 04:27.073
Stay out all night long
and come in here and be up all day.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.981
Me, I gotta be home by 12 midnight
if I gotta face Monroe in the morning.

04:31.154 --> 04:32.746
Hey, as far as I'm concerned...

04:32.922 --> 04:36.449
...Monroe can get the bozac,
you know what I'm saying?

04:38.261 --> 04:41.856
Johnson, you wouldn't happen to be
just getting here at 9:15?

04:42.832 --> 04:44.459
No, homey, I was on time.

04:44.634 --> 04:46.932
You didn't see me.
I was back there getting busy.

04:47.103 --> 04:49.196
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.862
- Well...
- Watch it.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.873
I am not one of your tack-head cronies.

04:54.043 --> 04:58.002
I'm the boss.
The head nigga in charge.

04:58.181 --> 05:00.376
Now, you get
your late ass to work, pronto.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.518
Don't forget that package
for Mr. Tinsdale.

05:02.685 --> 05:04.812
It was supposed to be on his desk
first thing.

05:04.988 --> 05:06.853
Guess who had to take the heat
over that?

05:07.023 --> 05:08.650
But no more, Johnson.

05:08.825 --> 05:10.486
No more.

05:12.295 --> 05:15.492
- Homey don't play that.
- You watch too much TV, man.

05:15.665 --> 05:17.963
No, I'm serious, man.
Monroe don't play no games.

05:18.134 --> 05:21.126
Yeah, well, neither do I.
I'm tired of this punk shit, man.

05:21.304 --> 05:24.102
I came here to be a real-estate broker,
not no damn mail boy.

05:24.273 --> 05:25.797
- I'm moving up.
- Up where?

05:25.975 --> 05:27.840
Upstairs. Land of suit and ties.

05:28.011 --> 05:30.809
Power lunches,
more girls than you can stand.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.413
I'm getting paid in full.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.914
Waymon Tinsdale's supposed
to help you get there?

05:35.084 --> 05:38.520
- That's right. Because that's my boy.
- Your boy? Man, don't make me laugh.

05:38.688 --> 05:40.349
Your boy
was supposed to help you...

05:40.523 --> 05:42.616
...get in that training program
two years ago.

05:42.792 --> 05:44.919
You ain't
but a late-in-the-house dreamer.

05:45.094 --> 05:49.155
- You ain't going nowhere.
- Yeah, that's what you think.

05:52.468 --> 05:55.164
Boy just don't know
when he got it good, do he?

05:58.875 --> 06:02.936
Gentlemen, real estate
in New York City is at an all-time low.

06:03.112 --> 06:06.878
Overbuilding and the soft economy...

06:07.050 --> 06:09.348
...have caused a record number
of foreclosures...

06:09.519 --> 06:11.043
...in New York in the last year.

06:12.588 --> 06:16.490
Now, the good news
is that the opportunities for cash buyers...

06:16.659 --> 06:19.719
...with the ability to wait out
this temporary market correction...

06:19.896 --> 06:21.295
...never been better.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.864
Gentlemen, if you please.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.164
We believe the Savoy Tower property...

06:26.335 --> 06:29.532
...is the most spectacular opportunity
of its kind in New York today.

06:29.705 --> 06:32.902
There isn't a foreclosure property
of this size in the city...

06:33.076 --> 06:34.839
...with a better return on investment.

06:35.011 --> 06:38.378
And Mr. Atwell and the First Manhattan Bank
are prepared to negotiate...

06:38.548 --> 06:40.743
...around-the-clock to close the deal
this week.

06:40.917 --> 06:43.181
That is, if you're prepared
to make an offer now.

06:43.352 --> 06:45.217
We've reviewed
your proposal carefully...

06:45.388 --> 06:46.980
...and we're extremely interested.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.522
However, before we can make
a formal offer...

06:49.692 --> 06:52.752
...we need detailed
15-year financial projections.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.588
Fifteen years?

06:54.764 --> 06:56.823
Yes. If the figures
meet our requirement...

06:56.999 --> 06:59.229
...we're prepared
to close the deal immediately.

06:59.402 --> 07:00.630
I understand.

07:00.803 --> 07:02.703
You'll have the projections
by Wednesday.

07:02.872 --> 07:06.000
If you have a minute, I'd like you
to meet our president, Mr. Drake.

07:06.175 --> 07:07.199
Excuse me.

07:07.376 --> 07:09.708
One of the unique features
of this property...

07:10.179 --> 07:13.171
Terrific, Waymon.
Don't let them move.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.010
I'm on my way.

07:15.585 --> 07:17.576
As I was saying...
- Excuse me, David.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.512
We'll have to continue this later.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.452
Something important has come up.

07:21.624 --> 07:25.025
Listen, why don't you
reschedule with Peg, huh?

07:25.695 --> 07:26.821
Sure.

07:26.996 --> 07:29.021
Okay, I...

07:30.266 --> 07:32.166
- Hey, Bobby.
- Gary.

07:32.335 --> 07:34.428
Doing up here
fronting in that weak-ass suit?

07:34.604 --> 07:37.732
Better get your Dr. Doolittle ass
upstairs before Monroe busts you.

07:37.907 --> 07:40.307
What are you talking about?
I'm out of the mailroom.

07:40.476 --> 07:42.239
I'm in the training program now.

07:42.411 --> 07:43.673
You?

07:43.846 --> 07:46.747
<i>Training program?
What is this, the Twilight Zone?</i>

07:46.916 --> 07:49.908
I've been trying to get in that program
since I started this gig.

07:50.086 --> 07:52.486
- How you get in?
- David Barnes.

07:52.655 --> 07:53.917
He liked my initiative.

07:54.090 --> 07:56.058
Initiative? What initiative?

07:57.093 --> 07:58.856
Hey, why you jumping
all over me, man?

07:59.028 --> 08:01.223
It's not my fault that I'm in
and you're not.

08:01.797 --> 08:04.493
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, man, congrats.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.225
Like I always said:

08:06.402 --> 08:09.235
"If you wanna make a power move,
you gotta have a hook-up. "

08:09.405 --> 08:11.930
You go for yours.
I'll damn sure go for mine.

08:19.615 --> 08:22.413
Wednesday. Wednesday.

08:23.152 --> 08:25.985
- Perfect.
- I had a good teacher.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.587
The presentation was excellent.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.666
But I'm concerned
about those projections.

08:38.833 --> 08:42.201
Don't be. The guy was taking advantage
of the soft market.

08:43.139 --> 08:46.302
He closed two foreclosure deals
in Los Angeles last month.

08:46.475 --> 08:49.706
This property is a steal.
And he knows it. Trust me.

08:52.415 --> 08:54.440
Cafe 43.

08:55.384 --> 08:57.375
Yeah. Yes, he is.

08:57.553 --> 08:59.418
Sure. No problem.

08:59.889 --> 09:02.221
Listen, Mr. Atwell needs
to call his office.

09:02.391 --> 09:03.722
- He's at Table 6.
- Okay.

09:03.893 --> 09:07.385
Closing this deal is important
to the bank and to you.

09:07.563 --> 09:10.031
Yes, I know.

09:33.689 --> 09:34.815
Excuse me.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.721
Mr. Atwell, there's a call for you.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.515
I think you owe me
an explanation, missy.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.453
Coming half an hour late
in the middle of the lunch rush.

10:09.625 --> 10:12.093
There must have been 100 people
at that audition.

10:12.261 --> 10:13.592
- Audition?
- Yes.

10:13.763 --> 10:16.960
If you had your priorities straight
you would have been here on time.

10:17.133 --> 10:19.294
I tried to get here on time.
Really, I did.

10:19.468 --> 10:22.232
I don't care.
if you would have left earlier...

10:22.405 --> 10:25.568
...then I wouldn't be here
trying to be manager and hostess.

10:25.741 --> 10:28.801
Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.
It'll never, ever happen again.

10:28.978 --> 10:34.041
Oh, I know it won't happen again
since I will have to fire you, missy.

10:34.517 --> 10:36.246
Oh, come on, Russ.

10:36.419 --> 10:38.011
You know how much I need this job.

10:38.187 --> 10:40.451
It's too late for begging, missy.
You're over.

10:40.623 --> 10:42.955
Missy? I have a name.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.855
- Use it.
- Lower your voice.

10:46.028 --> 10:48.553
I will do whatever the hell
I wanna do...

10:48.731 --> 10:51.996
...because I've had it with you
and this trifling job.

10:52.168 --> 10:53.567
I don't need this shit.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.968
It's not my career, unlike yourself,
Mr. Professional-Ass-Kisser.

10:58.140 --> 10:59.607
You're fired!

10:59.775 --> 11:01.299
Get out.

11:01.610 --> 11:04.101
With pleasure.

11:14.490 --> 11:15.479
Thanks.

11:19.195 --> 11:20.184
Miss.

11:23.399 --> 11:25.458
Is something wrong, sir?

11:28.838 --> 11:30.465
Hm? Uh...

11:30.639 --> 11:34.097
No. We're ready to order. Thank you.

11:39.148 --> 11:40.740
I don't look like a broker to you?

11:40.916 --> 11:42.645
That goes to show
how much you know...

11:42.818 --> 11:44.809
...about the world
of real estate, baby.

11:44.987 --> 11:46.454
A lot of us wear sneakers.

11:46.622 --> 11:49.887
It's a fast-moving game,
you just got to be able to keep up.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.924
Well, look, if you can't keep up,
I'm gonna have to step off.

11:53.095 --> 11:54.653
Step off now.

11:55.898 --> 11:57.889
It's cool, homey.
Just a minute, all right?

11:58.067 --> 12:00.695
Yeah, so, if...

12:00.870 --> 12:03.168
Hello? Hello, Tonya?

12:03.339 --> 12:05.204
Man, what's up with that shit, man?

12:05.374 --> 12:07.308
- I was almost in there.
In where?

12:07.476 --> 12:08.465
In there, man.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.976
You wouldn't know nothing about that,
so squash it.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.341
You know...

12:12.515 --> 12:16.713
...I am getting real tired of you
constantly abusing my friendship.

12:16.886 --> 12:18.979
I try to do things for you
whenever I can.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.055
And still, you pull stunts like this.

12:21.223 --> 12:22.554
Like what?

12:22.725 --> 12:27.424
Like what? Like using my office
as your own personal cafeteria.

12:27.596 --> 12:29.996
- Suppose I had been with a client.
- But you weren't.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.827
But suppose I was.

12:32.001 --> 12:35.334
This place smells
like a fast-food explosion.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.267
So open up a window
or something, man.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.374
I came here to talk to you for a reason.

12:39.542 --> 12:40.804
What now?

12:40.976 --> 12:42.739
Training program, man.

12:42.912 --> 12:45.403
- You was gonna hook me up.
- I did nothing of the sort.

12:45.581 --> 12:47.572
You asked me about it,
I told you. Simple.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.514
You said you was gonna help me.
Don't front on me like that.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.551
Even if that was true, which it's not...

12:52.721 --> 12:55.019
...they aren't accepting
any new trainees now.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.524
That's bullshit. My boy Gary O'Hara
just made the cut.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.356
Well, Gary went to St. John's University.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.724
I went to school too.

13:02.898 --> 13:05.765
Community college.
Not exactly the same thing.

13:05.935 --> 13:07.800
This is bogus.
Why you illing like that?

13:07.970 --> 13:11.133
Now, see? That is what
I am talking about.

13:11.307 --> 13:12.535
"llling"?

13:12.708 --> 13:15.506
What kind of word is that?
Look at the way you're dressed.

13:15.678 --> 13:18.772
I work in the mailroom. What am I
supposed to wear, Armani suit?

13:18.948 --> 13:20.006
No.

13:20.182 --> 13:23.083
But you don't have to speak
and dress so...

13:23.252 --> 13:25.152
So... How do I put this?

13:25.721 --> 13:28.918
- Black?
- Well, yes, black.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.660
You know what, G?

13:36.832 --> 13:39.323
You are straight-up
whiter than the whitest white man.

13:39.502 --> 13:43.268
I thought there was a bit of black
under that tired blue suit you got on.

13:43.439 --> 13:45.464
I see what time it is with you now.

13:45.641 --> 13:48.303
Thanks for nothing, Mr. Tinsdale.

13:52.715 --> 13:54.808
<i>Diedre on line one.</i>

14:00.623 --> 14:01.612
Hi.

14:01.790 --> 14:04.486
Waymon, how could you
cancel lunch today?

14:04.660 --> 14:07.322
I had something very important
to talk to you about.

14:07.496 --> 14:08.793
Don't you love me?

14:08.964 --> 14:11.330
Diedre, please. Of course I do.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.058
<i>I don't wanna fight with you now.</i>

14:13.235 --> 14:15.396
<i>I had to take a very important client
to lunch.</i>

14:15.571 --> 14:17.539
More important than me, I suppose?

14:17.706 --> 14:21.164
<i>Well, yes. Today, I suppose he was.</i>

14:24.046 --> 14:27.015
All right.
I'll just forget you ever said that.

14:27.182 --> 14:28.547
It's not important.

14:28.717 --> 14:31.208
I know how obsessive you can be
about work.

14:31.387 --> 14:33.321
All is forgiven.

14:33.489 --> 14:36.117
We'll talk about it tomorrow
on the squash court.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.261
Don't be late. Ciao, sweetie.

14:43.666 --> 14:47.124
- Good night, Mr. Tinsdale.
- Oh, good night, Donna.

14:59.081 --> 15:01.072
I don't know
where you know Natalie from...

15:01.250 --> 15:04.481
...but you might as well keep
your miniature-ass dick in your pants...

15:04.653 --> 15:06.621
...because the girl's too fly for you.

15:06.789 --> 15:08.313
Wait. You know this girl? Bobby.

15:08.857 --> 15:11.189
Pfft. Pencil dick.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.089
Weenie roast.

15:13.262 --> 15:16.026
Pig in a blanket. Mini-squirt.

15:34.483 --> 15:36.781
Hey, look at Mitchell over there.

15:36.952 --> 15:40.615
- Yeah.
- I hear he lost his job. His firm folded.

15:40.789 --> 15:44.623
Oh, man. Another real-estate broker
bites the dust.

15:44.793 --> 15:46.488
- That could be one of us.
- Not me.

15:46.662 --> 15:48.220
I have Porsche payments to make.

15:48.397 --> 15:51.855
- I told you not to buy that car now.
- I already have a mother.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.697
Anyway, as soon as Drake hands me
that partnership, I'm set.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.133
- You?
- Mm-hm.

15:58.807 --> 16:02.106
Be serious. Tinsdale is the man.
Everybody knows that.

16:02.277 --> 16:05.212
Yeah, everybody is wrong.
Our token black is not gonna use...

16:05.381 --> 16:06.939
...affirmative action to get my job.

16:07.116 --> 16:09.107
Whoa. I thought you and Waymon
were buddies.

16:09.284 --> 16:11.149
What does that have to do
with anything?

16:11.320 --> 16:13.379
I would just think
you'd be happy for him.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.750
Not as happy as I'd be for me.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.417
- Hey, guys.
- Waymon.

16:19.595 --> 16:22.120
- We were just talking about you.
- How you doing?

16:22.297 --> 16:25.664
- What took so long? You're late.
- Work. What else? I'm still not done.

16:25.834 --> 16:27.461
I'm just here taking a quick break.

16:27.636 --> 16:30.264
Uh, club soda with lime, please.

16:30.439 --> 16:32.066
You shouldn't work so hard, Waymon.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.766
You should find a nice little honey,
have some fun.

16:34.943 --> 16:37.605
- I have one.
- Who, Diedre? I thought that was over.

16:37.780 --> 16:39.680
Yeah, well...

16:39.848 --> 16:41.839
...we decided to give it another try.

16:42.685 --> 16:44.653
She must be a champ
between the sheets.

16:55.631 --> 16:58.759
Hang tough, Mitch. Wow.

16:58.934 --> 17:02.131
You know, his mistake was buying
all of that property up in Harlem.

17:02.304 --> 17:05.364
I tried to tell him that
gentrification shit was just a pipe dream.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.601
I mean, even Waymon wouldn't
be caught dead in that wasteland.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.142
Isn't that right, Waymon?

17:10.311 --> 17:14.544
Hey, don't be stupid.
Waymon probably grew up there, right?

17:15.250 --> 17:17.548
I don't think Waymon's
ever even been to Harlem.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.382
You ever been to Harlem, Waymon?

17:21.089 --> 17:22.614
You...

17:24.126 --> 17:25.820
I gotta get back to work.

17:25.993 --> 17:28.189
You guys take it easy.

17:28.363 --> 17:29.352
See you.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.306
What the hell are you doing here?

18:12.474 --> 18:13.941
- Me?
- You.

18:14.109 --> 18:16.509
I don't see
anyone else here stealing.

18:16.678 --> 18:20.705
- What you talking about, stealing?
- I'm talking about these.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.882
Don't you know I have to account
for every piece of paper...

18:27.055 --> 18:30.889
...every envelope,
every damn paper clip in here?

18:31.059 --> 18:34.495
It's my responsibility
to see that thieves like you...

18:34.663 --> 18:37.860
...don't nickel-and-dime this place
out of business.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.228
I wouldn't be bragging on no shit
if I were you.

18:40.402 --> 18:43.838
Mother... What? That's it. You're fired.

18:44.006 --> 18:45.769
You're finished. Get out.

18:45.941 --> 18:47.841
What's going on in here?

18:48.377 --> 18:51.972
Uh, nothing for you to concern
yourself with, Mr. Tinsdale.

18:52.915 --> 18:55.145
Well, I am concerned.

18:55.584 --> 18:59.452
I caught him red-handed,
stealing company property.

18:59.988 --> 19:01.819
What property?

19:02.758 --> 19:03.747
These.

19:06.995 --> 19:09.156
- These are mine.
- Yours?

19:09.331 --> 19:11.299
- What?
- They're mine.

19:11.466 --> 19:13.058
Well, actually,
a client of mine's.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.226
Bobby was doing me a favor,
weren't you?

19:16.138 --> 19:19.835
Yeah, yeah. I thought you had
cleared that with Mr. Taylor.

19:20.008 --> 19:22.806
Yeah, I don't appreciate that, man.
You almost got me fired.

19:22.978 --> 19:26.277
I'm down here trying to do business for you.
You know what I'm saying?

19:26.448 --> 19:28.006
You got me in a limbo.

19:28.183 --> 19:29.912
You put my shit in jeopardy.

19:30.085 --> 19:31.882
I said, I was sorry. Drop it.

19:32.054 --> 19:34.545
I apologize, Monroe.
This won't happen again.

19:34.723 --> 19:39.023
I am not taking the fall
for any shady goings-on.

19:40.295 --> 19:41.694
Good night.

19:43.732 --> 19:47.099
So, what brings you down here?
Slumming or what?

19:47.269 --> 19:49.863
Bobby, this girl on the flyer,
you know her?

19:50.038 --> 19:52.973
Yeah, I know her. So, what about it?

19:53.141 --> 19:55.803
Well, she was in this restaurant,
I was having lunch...

19:55.978 --> 19:59.141
...and she dropped this photograph.
And I'd like to return it.

20:00.015 --> 20:01.414
This about Natalie?

20:01.583 --> 20:03.551
This should be about the way
you dissed me.

20:03.719 --> 20:06.381
Come on, Bobby,
I made a mistake in judgment, okay?

20:06.555 --> 20:09.615
I'm sorry.
I was wrong not to at least listen.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.952
Yeah, okay. But I'm gonna tell you now.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.460
She ain't gonna be interested
in no square, blockheaded nigga like you.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.996
Later.

20:17.499 --> 20:18.488
Bobby.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.635
Just tell me where to find her.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.066
Yeah, keep dreaming.
Besides, what's in it for me?

20:23.238 --> 20:25.069
- A promotion.
- I heard that before.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.367
Not from a partner, you haven't.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.009
Partner?

20:29.478 --> 20:32.140
You introduce me to Natalie...

20:32.681 --> 20:36.811
...and start dressing like
you're going to work and not to a party...

20:36.985 --> 20:39.920
...and I'll put you
into the training program.

20:40.889 --> 20:42.356
Deal?

20:43.892 --> 20:46.292
Yeah, deal.

20:48.764 --> 20:50.493
Yeah.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.476
Shit. I'm late.

21:27.636 --> 21:29.035
Concentrate.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.968
I'm not playing anymore.

21:32.140 --> 21:35.268
Not until I find out
what is going on here.

21:35.444 --> 21:38.709
I'll tell you what's going on here.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

21:38.880 --> 21:43.544
Waymon, you're throwing us
completely off schedule.

21:43.719 --> 21:47.348
I was half an hour late. Shoot me.

21:47.522 --> 21:49.012
Don't tempt me.

21:49.191 --> 21:52.592
I'm not talking about today, stupid.
I'm talking about every day.

21:52.761 --> 21:53.989
Stupid?

21:54.162 --> 21:58.724
Waymon, if we don't start investing
some quality time into this relationship...

21:58.900 --> 22:01.334
...I'm afraid everything's gonna go
out of whack.

22:01.503 --> 22:02.936
What are you talking about?

22:03.105 --> 22:04.697
Well.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.062
Way...

22:06.808 --> 22:10.835
...I was figuring
that if we're engaged by Christmas...

22:11.013 --> 22:13.811
...then we can find the most perfect
condo in the winter...

22:13.982 --> 22:16.712
...which is the best time to shop.

22:16.885 --> 22:18.876
And then be married by summer.

22:19.054 --> 22:20.385
Married by summer?

22:20.555 --> 22:23.683
Oh, honey, it's the only possible time
for me to vacation.

22:23.859 --> 22:27.158
Look, we've only been back together
for two weeks.

22:34.369 --> 22:39.568
I mean, don't you think
that this is just a little premature?

22:40.342 --> 22:42.674
I think you better
get with the program, mister...

22:42.844 --> 22:44.778
...or lose the best woman you ever had.

22:48.550 --> 22:49.881
Diedre, wait.

22:50.986 --> 22:52.749
Diedre, wait.

22:52.921 --> 22:54.946
Diedre.

22:56.491 --> 23:00.291
Well, Millicent, you go to bed
with dogs, you wake up with fleas.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.293
And believe me, I am scratching.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.557
Well, you cannot say
I didn't tell you so.

23:04.733 --> 23:06.633
No, I guess I can't, Diedre.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.327
I knew he was wrong for you
the first time I met him.

23:09.504 --> 23:12.564
Oh, God. Sometimes I think
I'm just better off alone.

23:12.741 --> 23:14.333
Karen, how can you say that?

23:14.509 --> 23:16.977
Look at Waymon and me.
Our relationship is great.

23:17.612 --> 23:19.375
When you choose a man
with your head...

23:19.548 --> 23:21.948
...and not your heart,
you make a smarter choice.

23:22.117 --> 23:24.608
So I may not be in love
with Waymon...

23:24.786 --> 23:28.244
...but I know we make
a damn good team.

23:28.423 --> 23:32.757
What about romance, passion,
sex till you can't stand up straight.

23:32.928 --> 23:34.190
I need that.

23:34.362 --> 23:36.489
You got that and where'd that get you?

23:36.665 --> 23:40.157
A broken heart, a sore back,
a yeast infection.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.167
And a stack of bills.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.600
Speaking of sore backs.

23:44.773 --> 23:46.764
I sure hope there's gonna be men
at this party.

23:46.942 --> 23:49.274
Don't worry. Diedre has it covered.

23:49.444 --> 23:52.436
Waymon is inviting some eligibles
from work.

23:52.614 --> 23:54.343
Oh, God. I can imagine.

23:54.983 --> 23:56.473
Excuse me?

23:56.651 --> 23:58.414
Beggars can't be choosers.

23:58.587 --> 23:59.952
Check, please.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.689
Darryl, did Johnson get back
from lunch yet?

24:14.569 --> 24:16.400
You hear me talking to you, boy?

24:18.907 --> 24:21.034
I'm working through lunch
if you don't mind.

24:22.077 --> 24:24.807
Working through lunch?

24:26.381 --> 24:28.076
Man, what you looking at?

24:28.717 --> 24:32.414
You must be on something.
Or coming off it.

24:32.587 --> 24:34.885
I ain't on nothing and you know it.

24:35.056 --> 24:37.547
Oh, you're on something all right.

24:37.726 --> 24:41.389
Must be some powerful shit too.

24:47.135 --> 24:50.036
- What I tell you?
- You got it, man.

24:54.543 --> 24:57.341
Yo, yo.
- Hey.

24:57.512 --> 24:59.104
- Well?
- Well, what?

24:59.281 --> 25:01.442
- Well, what? Natalie.
- Don't worry about it.

25:01.616 --> 25:03.345
- You in there.
- In where?

25:03.518 --> 25:06.544
Forget about it. Meet me at
the Kilimanjaro tonight, midnight.

25:06.721 --> 25:08.154
Midnight? Are you crazy?

25:08.323 --> 25:10.848
I can't meet you at midnight.
I've gotta work tomorrow.

25:11.026 --> 25:12.118
And so do you.

25:12.294 --> 25:15.593
If you stay up past 9:00 one night,
it's not gonna kill you.

25:15.764 --> 25:18.494
That may be true,
but I can't meet you tonight anyway.

25:18.667 --> 25:21.636
- I've gotta meet Diedre.
- Man, you going out like that?

25:22.204 --> 25:24.695
No, as a matter of fact,
we're staying in.

25:25.574 --> 25:28.771
That's not what I meant, man.
Look, if you're there, you're there.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.504
If you're not,
hey, I did my part, right?

25:31.680 --> 25:32.669
Okay. Now, look...

25:33.782 --> 25:35.807
Hey, Bobby. What's up?

25:35.984 --> 25:38.043
- What's up, G-Man?
Gary...

25:38.220 --> 25:40.017
...let's go.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.930
What'd you wanna speak to me about?

25:54.102 --> 25:57.071
I wanted to let you know
I think you're doing an excellent job.

25:57.239 --> 25:58.831
Better than I could've hoped for.

25:59.007 --> 26:00.565
Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Barnes.

26:00.742 --> 26:03.006
But I wanna make sure
you go the distance.

26:03.178 --> 26:04.167
The distance?

26:04.346 --> 26:08.612
Let me be more specific.
Gary, my future is your future.

26:08.783 --> 26:10.410
Where I go, you go.

26:10.585 --> 26:15.818
When I am a partner in the most
powerful real-estate firm in New York...

26:15.991 --> 26:17.390
...we're gonna own this town.

26:18.326 --> 26:21.762
That is, if you're willing to do
what it takes.

26:21.930 --> 26:24.899
Yeah. Yeah, I'm willing to do anything.

26:25.066 --> 26:28.092
- I'm a team player.
- Good. Good.

26:28.270 --> 26:29.828
I'm glad to hear that, Gary.

26:30.905 --> 26:33.135
Driver, stop the car.

26:33.875 --> 26:35.069
Gary.

26:35.243 --> 26:38.007
Gary, get home safe, okay?

26:57.299 --> 27:00.632
All right. Okay, a little to the left.

27:00.802 --> 27:02.827
- A little to the left.
Sorry.

27:03.004 --> 27:05.598
Oh, good. All right. Now, grab it.

27:05.774 --> 27:07.639
Grab it. Harder.
Oh, good.

27:07.809 --> 27:09.276
All right. Don't stop.

27:09.444 --> 27:11.105
I said, don't stop.

27:11.279 --> 27:14.180
Good. All right. I'm there. I'm there.

27:14.349 --> 27:16.010
I'm there.

27:16.184 --> 27:19.051
Oh! Yes!

27:19.220 --> 27:22.246
Ahh. Ah.

27:26.428 --> 27:28.828
Could you get off me, please?

27:31.633 --> 27:34.363
- Ow. Careful.
- Sorry.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.874
For the thing.

28:23.885 --> 28:25.182
Excuse me.

28:25.353 --> 28:26.684
Excuse me.

28:26.855 --> 28:29.722
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.

28:29.891 --> 28:31.859
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

28:32.026 --> 28:34.221
Excuse me. Good evening.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.157
Good evening.

28:36.331 --> 28:37.525
Hi, ladies. How are you?

28:37.699 --> 28:39.963
Come on in.
Have a good time tonight.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.864
How are you doing, man?

28:43.738 --> 28:45.330
You can forget it.

28:48.276 --> 28:49.903
- Bobby.
- Hey, hey. What's up?

28:50.078 --> 28:51.909
- All right.
- How are you doing, big man?

28:52.080 --> 28:54.640
- What's up? You ready for this?
- Come on in.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.148
- I'm with him.
- Sure.

28:57.318 --> 28:59.183
- Hey, Bobby?
- Oh, he's with me.

28:59.954 --> 29:01.979
Sorry, man. Come on in.

29:06.761 --> 29:08.319
Hey. Hey.

29:10.298 --> 29:11.697
What was that guy's problem?

29:11.866 --> 29:15.427
Hey, man, if you're in, you're in.
If you're not, you're not. Simple as that.

29:15.603 --> 29:17.127
You're saying I'm not in?

29:17.305 --> 29:19.899
Look, don't you own
any fly gear at all, man?

29:20.074 --> 29:23.066
If you mean trendy clothes, no.
They're a waste of money.

29:23.244 --> 29:26.680
Look, if you wanna get next to Natalie,
who is definitely high-level...

29:26.848 --> 29:29.112
...you're gonna have to spend
some big bucks, man.

29:29.284 --> 29:32.219
This happens to be
a Brooks Brothers suit.

29:32.387 --> 29:34.651
Yeah. I suggest
you write that shit on the front.

29:34.823 --> 29:37.451
Because it looks like
any old tired-ass gray suit to me.

29:37.625 --> 29:39.388
What's up
with the Frankenstein shoes?

29:39.561 --> 29:42.587
- That shows how much you know.
- Hey, hey.

29:42.764 --> 29:44.959
That's all I'm trying to say.

29:48.403 --> 29:51.270
- Look, where is she?
- Look, man, she's here, all right?

29:51.439 --> 29:53.339
Try to have a little fun.
If you know how.

29:53.508 --> 29:55.442
Well, maybe she's not here tonight.

29:55.610 --> 29:57.942
I should go home
and get some work done.

29:58.112 --> 30:00.672
Look, the girl gives the parties here,
all right?

30:00.849 --> 30:03.477
Her job is to be here.
She's gonna be here.

30:03.651 --> 30:07.815
Why don't you just give that work shit
a rest, all right? And just chill.

30:20.702 --> 30:22.067
Yo, what you need?

30:22.237 --> 30:24.501
Yeah, yeah, give me
a Hennessey and Coke.

30:25.006 --> 30:27.804
And for my boy...
Waymon, what you want?

30:28.409 --> 30:32.209
Club soda, please, with lime.

30:33.014 --> 30:34.914
Man, what's up
with the club soda?

30:35.083 --> 30:39.019
It's late. I don't handle
hard liquor too well late at night.

30:39.187 --> 30:41.917
That sounds like some shit
you need to keep to yourself.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.285
You don't want people thinking
you're soft.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.689
Yo. I see skin. I'll be back.

30:50.865 --> 30:53.231
What? You see what?

31:17.392 --> 31:19.257
- So, what's your name, baby?
- Davika.

31:19.427 --> 31:22.328
- That's not your club name, huh?
- No. Do you have a club name?

31:22.497 --> 31:25.864
No, I ain't got no club name.
My name is straight-up Bobby.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.267
Would you like to dance?

32:32.200 --> 32:33.861
Excuse me.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.020
I'm sorry.

32:59.193 --> 33:02.924
Excuse me. Excuse me. Please.

33:03.998 --> 33:06.057
Excuse me. Excuse me.

33:19.614 --> 33:21.309
You with the corny suit on.

33:21.482 --> 33:25.384
Yeah. You just knocked over my drinks.
You gotta pay for it.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.754
Mr. Tinsdale knew
you were coming by this morning.

34:00.922 --> 34:03.516
I can't imagine what happened to him.

34:03.691 --> 34:06.251
Let me check his office
for the financial projections.

34:06.427 --> 34:09.157
You can look them over while you wait.
He'll be in shortly.

34:09.330 --> 34:10.489
I certainly hope so.

34:11.866 --> 34:12.855
Waymon?

34:15.703 --> 34:17.728
Mr. Tinsdale.

34:17.905 --> 34:19.429
- What time is it?
- Ten-fifteen.

34:19.607 --> 34:22.201
You had at 10 a. m. with Mr. Atwell.

34:22.376 --> 34:24.810
Oh, damn.

34:24.978 --> 34:26.879
You what?

34:27.547 --> 34:31.348
I called Mr. Kagawa and let them know
that they'll have it by Friday.

34:31.518 --> 34:33.110
We should have discussed this.

34:33.286 --> 34:36.723
I apologize. It just turned out to be
more work than I anticipated.

34:36.924 --> 34:39.984
You do realize how important
this deal is to both of us?

34:40.161 --> 34:43.221
- Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.
- You better be.

34:43.397 --> 34:46.924
Uh, Mr. Atwell, sir? Mr. Atwell.

34:47.101 --> 34:49.228
Mr. Atwell, please.

34:49.402 --> 34:53.032
This is not a problem. Believe me
when I tell you that I am on top of this...

34:53.206 --> 34:56.540
- I hope you haven't blown it.
- We'll speak later.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.168
Damn.

35:02.450 --> 35:06.318
Excuse me one second.
Hey, Waymon, wait up.

35:09.157 --> 35:11.921
Waymon. Waymon, what's wrong?
You look awful.

35:12.093 --> 35:13.390
I'm fine.

35:14.662 --> 35:17.893
Come on, this is me you're talking to.
I know there's something wrong.

35:18.065 --> 35:19.498
The Savoy Tower projections.

35:19.901 --> 35:22.131
I just never thought it would be
this much work.

35:22.303 --> 35:24.737
Well, why don't you let me help?

35:25.439 --> 35:28.169
That's okay. I got it covered.

35:28.342 --> 35:30.537
Hey, what are friends for?

35:30.711 --> 35:32.144
Friends?

35:35.616 --> 35:39.882
I gotta get back to work.
We'll talk about this later in private.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.851
Yeah. Yeah.

35:44.625 --> 35:46.354
Excuse me.

35:48.596 --> 35:50.393
What's with you and him?

35:51.132 --> 35:52.793
He's a racist bastard.

35:52.967 --> 35:54.832
Is that what you came in here
to tell me?

35:55.002 --> 35:58.597
If it is, I don't have time
to listen to your militant ravings right now.

35:58.773 --> 36:01.333
Just chill, brother. And picture this:

36:01.509 --> 36:04.706
Champagne, mellow music, you...

36:04.879 --> 36:08.246
...and Natalie
making that love connection.

36:08.416 --> 36:11.783
Oh, I can picture it.
When is it going to happen?

36:11.953 --> 36:14.444
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

36:14.622 --> 36:16.419
No, I can't make it tonight.

36:16.591 --> 36:19.116
I gotta get some sleep.
I've got a deadline to meet.

36:19.293 --> 36:22.660
I can't blow it. What about tomorrow?
Tomorrow works for me.

36:22.830 --> 36:26.129
Man, this ain't no damn power lunch, man.
This is love.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.268
You can't be
penciling that shit in, man.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.698
Let me tell you something.

36:29.871 --> 36:34.069
That ham is cooked, glazed
and ready to be sliced.

36:35.376 --> 36:37.435
You just gotta go for it.

36:37.612 --> 36:38.806
Okay. Okay.

36:40.514 --> 36:42.141
I just can't stay out late.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.612
Bet. But you can't go with me
looking like that tonight.

36:45.786 --> 36:48.448
What is wrong with the way I dress?

36:49.390 --> 36:50.789
Don't make me answer that.

36:50.958 --> 36:53.017
But I tell you what,
meet me after work...

36:53.194 --> 36:56.322
...I'll take you to the place.
I'll hook you up.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.288
Yeah.

36:59.734 --> 37:01.133
Bet.

37:22.456 --> 37:24.822
No, no, no.

37:33.734 --> 37:35.361
Forget it.

37:58.292 --> 37:59.782
All right.

38:00.461 --> 38:02.190
- You got it.
- I got it?

38:02.363 --> 38:04.331
- You got it.
- I got it.

38:09.603 --> 38:11.571
Yo, I got it going on.

38:11.739 --> 38:14.833
You know
what I'm saying to you, baby?

38:15.009 --> 38:18.706
I'm kicking it a lot.

38:29.790 --> 38:32.224
Oh, shit.

38:35.162 --> 38:38.689
I called you a hundred times.
You didn't return any of my calls.

38:38.866 --> 38:41.096
That's very unprofessional
of you, Waymon.

38:41.268 --> 38:43.395
Look, honey, you've come
at a really bad time.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.266
I was on my way out the door.

38:45.439 --> 38:47.407
What is going on with you?

38:47.575 --> 38:50.703
And I know
you are not seeing someone else.

38:50.878 --> 38:54.211
What? No, no.
Of course not. Come on.

38:54.382 --> 38:57.715
Now, look, I have a very important
meeting with my Japanese buyers.

38:57.885 --> 38:59.614
- Dressed like that?
- What do you mean?

38:59.787 --> 39:03.746
- Honey, I swear, you look like a jerk.
- Gee, thanks, hon.

39:05.593 --> 39:07.584
I didn't mean that.

39:07.762 --> 39:10.287
- So why don't I come with?
- You can't.

39:10.464 --> 39:14.491
I mean, you know how these Japanese
are about women seen and not heard.

39:14.668 --> 39:16.659
- Yes.
- Diedre, please. I'm running late.

39:16.837 --> 39:19.032
You're always
talking about staying focused.

39:19.206 --> 39:21.470
Making that almighty dollar
always comes first.

39:21.642 --> 39:23.735
- Right.
- A condo...

39:23.911 --> 39:26.903
...Benz, exotic vacations.

39:27.081 --> 39:29.811
Now, how am I supposed to get
all of that for you?

39:29.984 --> 39:34.182
I'll tell you how,
by working my tail off night and day.

39:34.355 --> 39:37.290
That's how, right?

39:37.458 --> 39:39.619
I guess you're right.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.989
I knew you'd understand.

39:53.374 --> 39:54.966
Hey, where are we going, anyway?

39:55.142 --> 39:57.906
You the one who said
you wanted to chase the girl down, right?

39:58.079 --> 40:00.309
So chill out and drive, man.

40:13.928 --> 40:15.589
Are we in Harlem?

40:15.763 --> 40:18.254
Yeah. So?

40:19.333 --> 40:20.527
Nothing.

40:20.701 --> 40:23.261
Don't tell me
you never been to Harlem before.

40:23.437 --> 40:24.836
That's crazy retarded.

40:25.005 --> 40:29.271
- You never been to Harlem before.
- Of course I've been uptown before.

40:30.077 --> 40:33.205
I just didn't know we were
coming up here tonight, that's all.

40:54.001 --> 40:56.128
What is this, one of those crack alleys?

40:56.303 --> 40:58.794
Crack alleys? Man, you tripping.

40:58.973 --> 41:00.702
This doesn't look safe to me, Bobby.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.843
Why don't you stop squawking
like a sucker?

41:03.010 --> 41:04.568
Don't nobody want what you got.

41:07.515 --> 41:09.312
Ow.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.776
She came here
to meet some of her people.

41:38.946 --> 41:40.277
There she is.

41:40.447 --> 41:43.746
- Who are those guys?
- Those guys are large and in charge.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.182
That's all you need to know.

41:46.587 --> 41:50.717
Like I was saying,
we should make a move on 2-5 Street.

41:50.891 --> 41:51.949
You're right.

41:52.126 --> 41:54.526
People don't appreciate the value
of that location.

41:54.695 --> 41:58.324
Yeah, brother. If we could
just bum-rush that entire situation.

41:58.499 --> 42:01.161
Hey, fellas, how's it going?
- Hey, Johnson.

42:01.902 --> 42:03.460
This is Waymon Tinsdale.

42:04.872 --> 42:08.137
Hey, home dudes. What is going on?

42:11.412 --> 42:13.903
Excuse us. We're busy.

42:14.081 --> 42:15.981
Hey, hey, no problem.

42:19.486 --> 42:23.946
Girl, he may be cute,
but he got too many ain't-gots.

42:24.124 --> 42:28.083
- So, what you saying?
- I'm saying he ain't got no A-P-T.

42:28.262 --> 42:29.286
Uh-huh.

42:29.463 --> 42:32.296
- He ain't got no J-O-B.
- I heard that.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.434
And he ain't got no C-A-R.

42:34.602 --> 42:37.093
You know, you can ride a dream
by yourself, girlfriend.

42:37.271 --> 42:39.171
- Thank you.
- There it is.

42:39.340 --> 42:40.830
Hi.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.034
It's on the house.

42:45.879 --> 42:47.403
Uh...

42:47.982 --> 42:48.971
Thanks.

42:49.149 --> 42:52.175
You all right?
You seem a little nervous.

42:52.853 --> 42:57.415
Me, nervous?
Hey, no. I'm just chilling.

42:58.559 --> 43:02.393
Is love this place. It's really, uh, def.

43:03.197 --> 43:04.755
Right.

43:04.932 --> 43:07.162
Well, enjoy yourself.

43:09.903 --> 43:11.165
What's happening, troop?

43:11.338 --> 43:13.397
What you drinking?

43:13.574 --> 43:18.238
- Uh, club soda with lime.
- Club soda with lime, yeah.

43:18.412 --> 43:22.178
Hey, bartender,
give us two shots of Black Label.

43:22.349 --> 43:23.748
No, I...

43:26.053 --> 43:29.580
Listen, Sherm, let me explain
something to you about women.

43:31.158 --> 43:33.285
These young ladies in here...

43:33.460 --> 43:39.456
...any man, even you,
can pull a serious fine honey out of here.

43:39.633 --> 43:44.002
All you gotta do is remember
one golden rule, which is...

43:44.204 --> 43:47.173
...the man with the gold, rules.

43:52.913 --> 43:55.404
Hey, I'd love to,
but my jeep is in the shop.

43:55.582 --> 43:58.642
Jeep? I thought you said
you had a Benz.

43:59.286 --> 44:00.275
I said that?

44:00.454 --> 44:03.981
- Yeah.
- I mean, my Benz, uh...

44:04.458 --> 44:07.791
Hey, Bobby, man.
I've been looking all over for you.

44:07.961 --> 44:10.862
- Johnnie Walker, Black.
- Man, what you been doing?

44:11.031 --> 44:14.057
Hey, man. Hey, sharp as a tack.

44:16.870 --> 44:18.269
Your ass is leery, man.

44:18.439 --> 44:22.102
- You've been over there...
- Maybe you two could use a little drink.

44:22.276 --> 44:23.573
Thanks, Nat.

44:23.744 --> 44:27.373
You know, you're kind of cute.

44:29.350 --> 44:30.749
You're in there.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.146
- I'm in there.
- In there.

44:32.319 --> 44:34.014
- Hey, I'm the man.
- You're the man.

44:34.188 --> 44:36.088
Hey, man, I'm jamming on the...

44:36.256 --> 44:38.247
Oh, shit.

44:40.361 --> 44:42.761
How about a BMW, baby?

44:42.930 --> 44:44.761
Know when to say when, boyfriend.

44:52.539 --> 44:54.564
You're a valued member
of this firm, David.

44:54.742 --> 44:57.267
Thank you.
- A real team player.

44:57.444 --> 44:59.378
I try, sir.

45:00.447 --> 45:02.711
You and Waymon Tinsdale are friends,
aren't you?

45:02.883 --> 45:06.148
Yes. Why?
Is he in some sort of trouble?

45:06.320 --> 45:08.117
Oh, no, no. Nothing like that.

45:08.288 --> 45:11.416
It's just that he is focusing
on a very important deal these days...

45:11.592 --> 45:13.492
...and hasn't much time
for anything else.

45:13.660 --> 45:17.255
I've tried to warn him
not to put all his eggs in one basket.

45:17.431 --> 45:19.422
What I wanna know is...

45:19.600 --> 45:22.068
...can you take on
some of his smaller deals?

45:22.236 --> 45:25.034
I want him to stay concentrated
on the Savoy Tower deal.

45:25.205 --> 45:27.173
When he closes that one...

45:27.341 --> 45:29.901
...it'll be a victory for the whole team.

45:30.711 --> 45:32.508
- Of course.
- Ah!

45:33.947 --> 45:37.348
- I knew I could count on you.
- Thank you.

45:38.252 --> 45:41.949
To hell with that deal
and the damn team.

45:49.797 --> 45:52.288
- Need some help?
- No.

45:54.668 --> 45:58.263
Listen. I've been meaning to talk to you
about my status here at the club.

45:58.439 --> 46:01.704
Since I took over promotions,
business has tripled.

46:01.875 --> 46:03.274
I should be a partner.

46:06.113 --> 46:08.638
- Jake.
- What?

46:09.016 --> 46:11.849
You and I both know
I made this club hot.

46:12.019 --> 46:14.283
Look. I don't have time for this
right now, okay?

46:14.455 --> 46:16.980
Hopefully we can talk about it later on.

46:21.128 --> 46:22.891
Natalie...

46:23.630 --> 46:25.564
...these just came for you.

46:25.732 --> 46:27.996
Oh, thank you.

46:40.314 --> 46:41.713
Finally.

46:41.882 --> 46:45.579
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

46:45.752 --> 46:48.482
Have you arranged for the messenger
for tomorrow morning?

46:48.655 --> 46:49.644
Absolutely.

46:49.823 --> 46:52.018
Don't forget to toss
these earlier projections.

46:52.192 --> 46:53.591
The numbers are all wrong.

46:53.760 --> 46:56.786
No problem. I'll take them down
to recycling right now.

46:56.964 --> 46:58.591
You've done enough for one day.

46:58.765 --> 47:00.392
Take care of it tomorrow.

47:00.567 --> 47:03.331
- Good night.
- Good night.

47:03.871 --> 47:05.236
- Hi, Bobby.
- How're you doing?

47:05.405 --> 47:07.498
- How's the head?
- Uh.

47:07.674 --> 47:10.734
Terrible. But I haven't had time
to think about it.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.811
I've been working
on the Savoy Tower deal.

47:12.980 --> 47:15.380
The deal I almost blew
hanging out with you.

47:15.549 --> 47:18.609
Tomorrow morning, the projections
will be delivered by messenger...

47:18.785 --> 47:20.650
...at 7 a. m.
- Messenger?

47:20.821 --> 47:24.120
Are you crazy? Those brothers are ill.
Give it to me, I'll take it.

47:24.291 --> 47:26.191
They're not in right now, anyway.

47:26.827 --> 47:30.228
And I don't wanna take the chance
that the hotel will lose it.

47:30.397 --> 47:34.390
Besides, I feel more comfortable
with a professional messenger.

47:34.568 --> 47:36.763
Man, now I'm insulted.

47:36.937 --> 47:40.839
Tomorrow morning, the deal will be done.
You'll be my trainee.

47:41.008 --> 47:42.942
Not because you helped me
meet Natalie...

47:43.110 --> 47:45.044
...but because
you deserve the chance.

47:45.212 --> 47:48.648
The least you could do is trust me
to make a run across town.

47:48.815 --> 47:50.612
With this in the hands
of a stranger...

47:50.784 --> 47:54.811
...you won't be able to concentrate on
the real deal: getting busy with Natalie.

47:54.988 --> 47:57.115
Okay. I get your point.

47:57.291 --> 47:59.987
- Seven a. m.
- I'll be there at 6:30.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.128
Great. Now, where's my car?

48:02.296 --> 48:04.287
- I left it at home.
- What?

48:04.464 --> 48:06.159
Don't worry. It's safe, all right?

48:07.634 --> 48:08.931
All right.

48:09.102 --> 48:10.296
Look.

48:10.470 --> 48:14.133
Meet me at this address
at 10:00.

48:14.308 --> 48:16.139
Don't be late.

48:17.344 --> 48:18.902
Tonight's the night.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.445
Bet.

48:27.588 --> 48:31.854
You know, we have sort of this open thing
happening now, you know?

48:32.025 --> 48:35.392
And I really believe in giving a man
his space.

48:35.562 --> 48:37.553
It can benefit everyone
in the relationship.

48:37.731 --> 48:38.720
Now, don't you agree?

48:38.899 --> 48:41.629
Well, I don't know.
I'm married, faithful and very happy.

48:41.802 --> 48:45.203
Oh, congratulations. Excuse me.

48:47.574 --> 48:49.064
Waymon. Waymon.

48:49.242 --> 48:51.938
Hi, Waymon? Hey.

48:52.112 --> 48:55.548
You remember...
You remember, uh, Susan. Susan.

48:55.716 --> 48:57.013
Nice to meet you.

48:57.184 --> 48:58.879
So how's the Atwell deal coming?

48:59.686 --> 49:01.017
Great. Great.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.746
What? What, it's done?

49:02.923 --> 49:05.824
No. It will be tomorrow
when they receive the new projections.

49:05.993 --> 49:09.895
Oh, I see. Oh, well, that's great.
That's great. Good luck, Waymon.

49:10.063 --> 49:12.122
Thank you. Thank you.

49:12.299 --> 49:14.529
Waymon. Honey.

49:15.702 --> 49:17.499
Excuse me.

49:27.147 --> 49:30.742
Hey, turn that down
or I'm calling the police.

49:32.252 --> 49:35.619
- You talking to me?
- I don't see any other idiots out here.

49:36.490 --> 49:37.821
Crazy bitch.

49:37.991 --> 49:41.893
- Low-life.
- Baby, your weave's too tight.

49:46.333 --> 49:48.301
Oh, shit.

49:48.468 --> 49:52.302
With this recession and unemployment
reaching an all-time high...

49:52.472 --> 49:55.066
...the job market is a merciless place.

49:55.242 --> 49:56.732
- Isn't that right?
- Hm?

49:56.910 --> 49:58.309
Uh, yes, absolutely.

49:58.478 --> 50:00.070
The black youth have it the worst.

50:00.247 --> 50:03.114
And it's a shame
that they just aren't prepared.

50:03.283 --> 50:06.116
I honestly think they don't know
what it takes to get ahead.

50:06.286 --> 50:08.618
What exactly are you saying?

50:08.789 --> 50:10.814
I'm saying that...

50:10.991 --> 50:13.186
...carving your name
on the back of your head...

50:13.360 --> 50:16.090
...is not exactly a career move.

50:16.263 --> 50:18.094
Diedre, that's ridiculous.

50:18.265 --> 50:21.359
I mean, one thing
has absolutely nothing to do with the other.

50:22.469 --> 50:25.267
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Certainly.

50:26.473 --> 50:30.967
How dare you contradict me
in front of people.

50:31.144 --> 50:34.011
I don't know what's going on with you,
but I don't like it.

50:34.181 --> 50:36.308
You know what's going on me?

50:36.483 --> 50:38.644
I'm finally seeing the light.

50:38.819 --> 50:41.652
Who do you think you are
that you can tell me what to think?

50:41.822 --> 50:44.450
Or what to wear, what to do?

50:44.624 --> 50:48.458
I need a companion. I need a friend.
Not an overseer.

50:48.628 --> 50:51.529
I will not have this discussion here.

50:52.466 --> 50:54.798
I'll call the police.
- You better stop fronting.

50:54.968 --> 50:57.129
- I ain't after your fake-ass gold.
- Excuse me.

50:57.304 --> 50:58.532
I'm here to see Waymon.

50:58.705 --> 51:00.036
- Waymon?
Hey.

51:00.207 --> 51:03.335
- What's up?
- What is this person doing here?

51:03.510 --> 51:05.307
Person? You fake Whitney Houston-ass...

51:05.479 --> 51:07.845
- You nappy-headed thing...
- All right. Hold it.

51:08.014 --> 51:10.380
This person happens to be
a friend of mine.

51:10.550 --> 51:13.348
- His name is Bobby Johnson.
A friend of yours?

51:13.520 --> 51:15.454
I'm not gonna take much more of this.

51:15.622 --> 51:17.385
This shit is whack. I'm out of here.

51:17.557 --> 51:19.081
- Bobby, wait.
- Wait.

51:19.259 --> 51:20.521
Hey, you coming?

51:20.694 --> 51:22.127
Coming where?

51:22.295 --> 51:25.389
If you leave this party with that thug...

51:25.565 --> 51:29.695
...it's over.
I never wanna see you again.

51:38.578 --> 51:40.102
Okay.

51:40.280 --> 51:41.941
Fine.

51:45.285 --> 51:47.185
You son of a bitch!

51:47.354 --> 51:49.288
You better get your black ass
out here.

51:49.456 --> 51:51.390
I'm counting to one, two...

52:00.834 --> 52:03.394
Man, don't even sweat that, man.

52:03.570 --> 52:05.197
She ain't all that.

52:05.705 --> 52:07.935
She needs to take
some of that attorney money...

52:08.108 --> 52:11.509
...and purchase some more ass.
That what she need to do.

52:12.879 --> 52:16.474
Come on. You know the girl look like
a well-dressed number-two pencil, man.

52:18.685 --> 52:20.778
Sex was probably weak too.

52:20.954 --> 52:23.320
She's like one of them
military-type bitches.

52:23.490 --> 52:24.889
Military?

52:25.058 --> 52:26.548
You know, military. You know:

52:26.726 --> 52:28.353
<i>Left, right, left</i>

52:28.528 --> 52:30.325
<i>In, out, in</i>

52:30.497 --> 52:34.524
<i>Hump, half, hump, right
Hump, full, hump</i>

52:41.007 --> 52:42.770
I'm right, right?

52:45.846 --> 52:48.212
Just be there in half an hour.

52:48.381 --> 52:52.283
Gary, I really don't care.
Just be there.

52:55.689 --> 52:58.123
I'm sorry, everybody,
but the club's been closed.

52:58.291 --> 53:01.886
- What?
- I'm as surprised as all of you are.

53:02.062 --> 53:05.190
But you'll all get invitations
to my next event.

53:05.732 --> 53:07.927
I'm really sorry.

53:12.873 --> 53:13.862
What's going on?

53:14.608 --> 53:16.872
The club has been padlocked
by the damn IRS.

53:17.043 --> 53:19.568
And that asshole Jake
didn't even tell me what was up.

53:19.746 --> 53:23.614
I invited all these people down here.
And now I look like a fool.

53:23.783 --> 53:25.182
No, you don't.

53:25.552 --> 53:28.612
More than that,
I don't even get paid for tonight.

53:28.788 --> 53:30.949
I can just forget about my partnership.

53:32.225 --> 53:35.126
I gotta get out of here.
Can you give me a ride?

53:39.933 --> 53:43.994
Oh, yeah. Right. Right.

53:44.170 --> 53:45.728
No problem.

53:45.906 --> 53:47.203
Why don't you go ahead?

53:47.374 --> 53:49.604
I got some important things
to take care of tomorrow.

53:49.776 --> 53:52.643
Yeah, we'll see you later.

53:53.480 --> 53:54.970
See you.

53:56.750 --> 53:58.047
My boy's in there.

53:58.985 --> 54:00.816
Watch your legs.

54:15.635 --> 54:18.263
Come on. Come on.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.029
You're late.

54:20.206 --> 54:22.197
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

54:22.375 --> 54:24.172
Now, come on.

54:27.480 --> 54:32.179
I'm so tired of everything always
blowing up in my face.

54:32.352 --> 54:36.118
Nothing I do ever turns out
the way I plan it.

54:36.957 --> 54:40.120
What is it exactly that you wanna do?

54:40.293 --> 54:42.727
Well, for a long time, it was dancing.

54:42.896 --> 54:44.454
But the auditions are murder.

54:44.631 --> 54:48.829
And then when I finally do get a job,
the money barely pays the rent.

54:49.002 --> 54:51.300
I just don't know anymore.

54:52.405 --> 54:55.101
You know what
I've always dreamed of doing?

54:55.275 --> 54:57.573
- Owning my own nightclub.
- Yeah?

54:57.744 --> 55:01.077
- Mm-hm.
- Well, don't give up on that one.

55:01.815 --> 55:06.184
When I was in junior high school,
I wanted to join a band.

55:06.353 --> 55:08.913
You know, be a rock star.

55:09.089 --> 55:12.354
So I asked my parents
if I could take guitar lessons.

55:12.525 --> 55:14.288
They said, "Absolutely not.

55:14.461 --> 55:17.021
We're not going to spend
our hard-earned money...

55:17.197 --> 55:19.927
...on some guitar lessons. "

55:20.133 --> 55:22.260
So I tried to teach myself...

55:22.435 --> 55:26.201
...and after a while,
I got discouraged and I stopped.

55:26.373 --> 55:28.500
Now, if I'd continued, who knows?

55:28.675 --> 55:32.406
Might have been
Michael Jackson, Prince...

55:32.579 --> 55:35.639
...Waymon Tinsdale III.

55:39.386 --> 55:42.287
There's not a more beautiful view
in all the world.

55:50.163 --> 55:51.824
You are so beautiful.

55:54.701 --> 55:56.032
Thank you.

57:36.069 --> 57:37.764
Are we gonna get busted
for this?

57:37.937 --> 57:40.599
Not if you keep your mouth shut.

57:55.889 --> 57:58.585
Bingo. Okay.

57:58.758 --> 58:03.024
We're just gonna make a few changes
in these projections, okay?

58:03.196 --> 58:04.754
Come on.

58:04.931 --> 58:06.990
Do your thing.

58:09.035 --> 58:12.095
- Come on.
- All right. All right. All right.

58:24.817 --> 58:27.251
- We're in.
- Yeah.

58:54.581 --> 58:56.173
What's up, Pep?

59:13.633 --> 59:16.261
<i>Mr. Kagawa on line one.</i>

59:18.304 --> 59:20.067
Good morning.

59:26.746 --> 59:28.805
I trusted you and you blew it.

59:28.982 --> 59:31.473
How could you have messed this up?
How? How?

59:31.651 --> 59:34.245
- Get off me, man. You tripping.
- Yeah, I'm tripping.

59:34.420 --> 59:36.183
What the hell's going on here?

59:36.356 --> 59:38.654
The Savoy Tower deal. Bobby blew it.

59:38.825 --> 59:40.383
I showed him the package...

59:40.560 --> 59:44.360
...but somehow he managed to get an
earlier draft with all the wrong numbers.

59:44.530 --> 59:47.090
All I did is what you asked me to do.
That's all I did.

59:47.267 --> 59:50.259
The Japanese took one look
at those figures, made a phone call...

59:50.436 --> 59:52.404
...and closed a deal
with somebody else.

59:52.572 --> 59:54.369
They're on a plane to Los Angeles.

59:54.540 --> 59:57.873
I'm finished. And so are you.

01:00:01.114 --> 01:00:04.106
Well, you heard the man. You're fired.

01:00:04.284 --> 01:00:07.253
Get your stuff and go.

01:00:18.398 --> 01:00:20.730
I'm very sorry, sir.
I don't know how this happened.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.197
What do you mean?

01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:25.269
You put a multimillion-dollar deal
in the hands of a mail boy.

01:00:25.438 --> 01:00:27.235
That's how it happened. Waymon...

01:00:27.407 --> 01:00:30.171
...this isn't the kind of error
a partner would make.

01:00:30.343 --> 01:00:32.208
Wait a minute. Sir, I can fix this.

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:35.836
- I just have to find a new buyer.
- We've lost the listing.

01:00:36.015 --> 01:00:38.074
Atwell intends
to take the bank's business...

01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:39.718
...to another firm on Monday.

01:00:40.286 --> 01:00:42.618
Mr. Drake, I can do this.

01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:44.913
I doubt it.

01:00:48.594 --> 01:00:51.154
Well, what about Sunday?
We can do brunch.

01:00:51.331 --> 01:00:54.630
Yeah, I see. Well, this deal is ready to go.

01:00:55.601 --> 01:00:57.398
Sure. Sure.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:00.038
Well, some of the best deals are done
on short notice.

01:01:01.374 --> 01:01:03.604
Mr. Vance, excuse me. I'm sorry.
One second.

01:01:03.776 --> 01:01:07.234
<i>- Yeah, Sheila, what is it?
There's a Natalie here to see you.</i>

01:01:07.413 --> 01:01:09.278
Send her in.

01:01:09.449 --> 01:01:12.907
Sorry about that, Mr. Vance.
As I was saying, the... Hello?

01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:15.247
- Hello, Mr. Vance?
Hi.

01:01:15.421 --> 01:01:18.015
Mr. Vance. Damn.

01:01:18.791 --> 01:01:21.055
Would you get me Vance
on the line again, please?

01:01:21.227 --> 01:01:23.354
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:23.629 --> 01:01:25.256
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:26.762
What is it?

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:29.094
You invited me to lunch, remember?

01:01:29.268 --> 01:01:32.237
Damn. I've been so busy,
I totally forgot.

01:01:32.405 --> 01:01:34.305
I'm sorry, I can't go now.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:36.875
No problem. You wanna meet later?

01:01:37.043 --> 01:01:39.011
I don't think so.

01:01:39.178 --> 01:01:40.577
What's the matter with you?

01:01:40.747 --> 01:01:43.875
This happens to be the worst day
of my life. That's the matter.

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:47.713
There's a whole lot of that going around.
Darryl just told me Bobby got fired.

01:01:47.887 --> 01:01:50.651
Yeah, well, he's a big boy.
I'm sure he'll get over it.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.520
I thought you two were friends.

01:01:53.693 --> 01:01:57.789
Hardly. If it hadn't been for him dragging
me all over the city chasing after you...

01:01:57.964 --> 01:01:59.898
...none of this would have happened.

01:02:00.066 --> 01:02:01.533
What's that supposed to mean?

01:02:02.602 --> 01:02:04.035
Nothing. Nothing.

01:02:04.203 --> 01:02:05.864
<i>I have Mr. Vance on the line.</i>

01:02:06.038 --> 01:02:08.666
Uh, excuse me. I have to take this.

01:02:09.342 --> 01:02:11.310
Take it and shove it.

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:13.968
I don't know what made me think
you were so different.

01:02:19.252 --> 01:02:20.378
Natalie.

01:02:20.553 --> 01:02:23.215
Natalie. Natalie, wait. Natalie, please.

01:02:24.524 --> 01:02:26.515
Drop dead.

01:02:27.026 --> 01:02:30.086
Natalie. Natalie.

01:02:42.809 --> 01:02:44.743
- Waymon?
- What?

01:02:44.911 --> 01:02:48.847
Don't snap at me.
Just calm down for a minute.

01:02:49.649 --> 01:02:52.277
I printed a copy of the final report.

01:02:52.452 --> 01:02:55.182
This is completely different
than any of our drafts.

01:02:55.354 --> 01:02:57.322
This wasn't a mix-up.

01:02:57.490 --> 01:03:00.550
Someone or something
must have changed the projections.

01:03:00.726 --> 01:03:03.388
But whoever it was,
it wasn't Bobby.

01:03:23.983 --> 01:03:25.348
Hi.

01:03:25.818 --> 01:03:27.376
Hey.

01:03:28.421 --> 01:03:30.321
Listen, I, uh...

01:03:30.857 --> 01:03:33.291
I just wanted to say job well done.

01:03:33.459 --> 01:03:35.256
Oh, thanks.

01:03:35.428 --> 01:03:38.522
You know, Bobby got fired.

01:03:38.865 --> 01:03:41.265
He was on his way out anyway.

01:03:41.501 --> 01:03:43.867
Look, business is business.

01:03:44.036 --> 01:03:45.663
Remember that.

01:03:46.539 --> 01:03:48.803
Take this to Processing.

01:05:02.048 --> 01:05:03.481
Hey, the girl was dope.

01:05:04.684 --> 01:05:06.515
You know what I'm saying?

01:05:06.686 --> 01:05:09.177
Ten-high. It's Sydney Poitier.

01:05:09.355 --> 01:05:11.380
Guess who's coming to get high?

01:05:12.825 --> 01:05:15.692
Hey, Bobby, can I talk to you?

01:05:15.861 --> 01:05:17.453
I can't hear you.

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:20.190
Ain't you heard?
He ain't got the booters no more.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.995
- Please?
- We ain't got no crack neither, Sydney.

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:24.796
You're in the wrong spot for that.

01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:27.337
Hey, look,
why don't you just back off, okay?

01:05:28.874 --> 01:05:30.341
You want a piece of me?

01:05:31.377 --> 01:05:33.277
- Come on.
- Better do something about that.

01:05:33.446 --> 01:05:37.143
- Let's do this.
- Man. Man, time-out.

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:40.447
Let's take a walk.

01:05:43.322 --> 01:05:46.655
All right. So you came here to talk.
So talk.

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:52.520
I wanted to apologize
for what happened today.

01:05:52.698 --> 01:05:55.258
I accused you of doing something
that you didn't do.

01:05:55.434 --> 01:05:57.402
That you couldn't have done.

01:05:58.804 --> 01:06:00.601
I'm sorry.

01:06:02.475 --> 01:06:04.807
That's black folks' problem, man.

01:06:04.977 --> 01:06:07.445
Always passing judgment
on each other.

01:06:07.613 --> 01:06:10.343
Putting our own brothers down,
and for what?

01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:13.275
You're right.

01:06:14.086 --> 01:06:16.054
We're friends.

01:06:16.756 --> 01:06:19.281
Bobby, I should have trusted you.

01:06:25.031 --> 01:06:27.795
People need to give each other
more credit, man.

01:06:27.967 --> 01:06:30.765
Take a little more time
to understand each other.

01:06:30.936 --> 01:06:35.100
Look, Bobby, I'm probably gonna
offer the firm my resignation.

01:06:35.274 --> 01:06:39.608
But I want you to know that before I go,
I'm gonna try to get your job back.

01:06:39.779 --> 01:06:40.768
Quit?

01:06:41.781 --> 01:06:43.908
No, man, you can't go out like that.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:46.813
We need you in there,
help put some brothers down.

01:06:46.986 --> 01:06:52.083
Bobby, I've gotta find a buyer
willing to invest $ 75 million by Monday.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:55.125
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

01:06:55.294 --> 01:06:57.159
You deserve that partnership, man.

01:06:57.863 --> 01:07:00.388
Look, I got an idea.
Am I still your trainee?

01:07:00.566 --> 01:07:01.965
Hey, you know it.

01:07:02.134 --> 01:07:05.103
It's, "You know that.
You know that. "

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:07.034
Whatever. What are you gonna do?

01:07:07.206 --> 01:07:09.436
Get your high-powered
presentation together.

01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:13.237
I'll check you on Monday.
I got some people I gotta see.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.604
What are you gonna do?

01:07:16.215 --> 01:07:19.412
Just get out of Harlem
before you get your ass whipped.

01:07:37.436 --> 01:07:39.666
Here you are.
Been looking all over for you.

01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:43.502
Now you know where to find me.
The late Frank Burke's office.

01:07:44.543 --> 01:07:46.511
- Did you have a good weekend?
- Pretty good.

01:07:46.679 --> 01:07:48.840
You wanna get some lunch? My treat.

01:07:49.014 --> 01:07:52.575
Why not? You can take me to
the Ferry Bank Café. I love that place.

01:07:52.752 --> 01:07:54.845
Are you crazy?
It's all the way in Brooklyn.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.681
Hey, you're going out
with the boss.

01:07:56.856 --> 01:07:59.654
Lunch is over when I say
that lunch is over.

01:08:00.726 --> 01:08:02.421
Now you're talking.

01:08:02.895 --> 01:08:04.487
All right.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:10.158
He's having trouble with the financing
on this gold-company deal.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:11.769
It's not penciling out right.

01:08:11.937 --> 01:08:15.065
I could get a better loan
from a guy named Vinny.

01:08:19.211 --> 01:08:22.703
It's the Halloran brothers
to see Waymon Tinsdale.

01:08:25.317 --> 01:08:29.947
Sheila, the Halloran brothers
to see Mr. Tinsdale.

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:40.392
Well, Bobby, here's your boy.

01:08:40.832 --> 01:08:42.562
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey. All right.

01:08:42.734 --> 01:08:44.703
Y'all remember my homeboy,
Waymon Tinsdale?

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:46.394
How could I forget?

01:08:46.572 --> 01:08:48.733
It's nice to see you again.

01:08:49.274 --> 01:08:52.642
Leroy Halloran. These are my brothers
Roland and Theodore.

01:08:52.812 --> 01:08:54.712
The Halloran brothers?

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.973
The ones that own
the Harlem National Bank?

01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:58.582
In the flesh.

01:08:59.919 --> 01:09:02.183
Oh, I didn't know.

01:09:02.354 --> 01:09:06.620
Man, you must have really thought
I was a jerk the first time we met.

01:09:06.792 --> 01:09:08.419
You could say that.

01:09:08.594 --> 01:09:10.926
But thanks to Bobby,
we came anyway.

01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:13.962
- Hey, just doing my job.
- And a good job it is.

01:09:14.133 --> 01:09:17.330
Would you escort these gentlemen
to conference room B, please?

01:09:17.502 --> 01:09:18.834
Hey, no problem. Fellas?

01:09:23.274 --> 01:09:26.243
Get Atwell on the phone.
No, send a limousine for him.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:30.678
Tell him I'm meeting with the Halloran
brothers of the Harlem National Bank.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.612
I present to you the Savoy Tower.

01:09:36.788 --> 01:09:40.189
Downtown Manhattan,
prime real estate.

01:09:42.328 --> 01:09:44.591
One, we'll begin...

01:09:51.837 --> 01:09:54.965
And one of the most exciting features
is the pedestrian mall.

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.802
it has 84 stories.

01:10:02.748 --> 01:10:04.147
Six million dollars.

01:10:04.316 --> 01:10:08.047
Four-four-seven-zero
two-nine-four-seven-zero-three...

01:10:13.225 --> 01:10:17.252
- two thousand dollars per square foot,
offers a projected income...

01:10:17.429 --> 01:10:20.398
...of a quarter of a billion dollars.

01:10:20.566 --> 01:10:24.024
All right.
We're only a little apart on pricing.

01:10:24.203 --> 01:10:27.866
You sweeten your deal by $2 million,
you got a deal.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.600
- Deal.
- Yeah.

01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:37.179
Hey, yeah.

01:10:44.957 --> 01:10:46.720
Waymon, what the hell
is going on here?

01:10:46.892 --> 01:10:48.189
Mr. Drake.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.523
We were getting ready to call you
and invite you down to the celebration.

01:10:51.697 --> 01:10:52.925
Celebration?

01:10:53.098 --> 01:10:56.295
Yes. With the assistance
of Mr. Bobby Johnson...

01:10:56.468 --> 01:10:58.698
...the Savoy Tower has a buyer.

01:10:59.305 --> 01:11:00.863
Oh?

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.838
Mr. Drake, I'd like to introduce you
to the Halloran brothers...

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:05.271
...of Harlem National Bank.

01:11:05.444 --> 01:11:07.173
- What's up, homes?
- What's happening, Jack?

01:11:08.914 --> 01:11:10.745
They've agreed to our terms.

01:11:12.451 --> 01:11:13.509
I see.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.717
Well, Mr. Johnson...

01:11:18.057 --> 01:11:20.321
...where's my glass?

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:27.724
- Thank you very much, sir.
It feels good, doesn't it?

01:11:29.268 --> 01:11:31.259
- Roland, thank you for coming by.
- Yes.

01:11:31.437 --> 01:11:33.132
We look forward to seeing you.

01:11:33.305 --> 01:11:34.431
Anything I can do.

01:11:34.606 --> 01:11:37.006
Boy, that's the life, huh?

01:11:38.944 --> 01:11:40.605
Are you just coming back
from lunch?

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:43.944
- Yes, sir.
- I'll speak with you later.

01:11:44.783 --> 01:11:46.808
Hey, what's going on here?

01:11:46.986 --> 01:11:48.886
Only closing the Savoy Towers deal.

01:11:49.054 --> 01:11:52.751
What? Wait, what are you doing here?
You were fired.

01:11:52.925 --> 01:11:54.893
Well, he's rehired.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.260
I'm taking this up with the board, sir.

01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:00.398
And tell them what?

01:12:02.634 --> 01:12:05.398
All right, shut up and get out.
You're fired.

01:12:05.971 --> 01:12:07.768
You can't fire me, because I quit.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.407
This is getting good.

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:13.807
Mr. Tinsdale, I changed the figures
on your report Thursday night.

01:12:13.979 --> 01:12:15.571
- You did what?
- What?

01:12:16.348 --> 01:12:18.009
I know...
David told me to do it.

01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:20.250
You damn liar.

01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:22.114
You watch yourself, Mr. Barnes.

01:12:22.287 --> 01:12:23.948
I shouldn't have done it.
I'm sorry.

01:12:24.123 --> 01:12:26.250
I don't have to stay here
and listen to this.

01:12:27.326 --> 01:12:31.023
It says here,
"David Barnes, in, 12:30 a. m., out... "

01:12:31.196 --> 01:12:33.323
Give me that, you stupid nig...

01:12:36.969 --> 01:12:38.800
God, dog.

01:12:39.738 --> 01:12:41.103
Way to go, Waymon.

01:12:41.273 --> 01:12:45.767
Mr. Tinsdale, I'll see you
in the office, partner.

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:48.208
Yes, sir.

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:50.415
- Thank you.
I didn't know he had it in him.

01:12:50.582 --> 01:12:52.516
Uh... Uh...

01:12:52.684 --> 01:12:54.345
...Mr. Drake, if I could just...

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.613
- Partner. I'm a partner.
- Partner. You did it.

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:59.622
- All this time, man.
- That's what he said, man.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:03.626
- Tyson. You see that jab?
- Whoo!

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:27.983
Who is it?
- Waymon.

01:13:30.556 --> 01:13:32.217
What do you want?

01:13:32.391 --> 01:13:34.291
Uh... Well...

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:38.819
...I came by because
I wanted to apologize for what happened.

01:13:38.997 --> 01:13:40.521
I'm really sorry.

01:13:41.066 --> 01:13:42.260
You should be.

01:13:42.434 --> 01:13:45.892
I never ever wanted to hurt you.
Natalie, I just want another chance.

01:13:46.071 --> 01:13:47.732
I need you.

01:13:49.174 --> 01:13:50.937
I hope he brought his kneepads.

01:13:52.811 --> 01:13:54.904
I'm on my knees. I'm begging.

01:13:59.785 --> 01:14:02.185
Get up. Somebody might see you.

01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:04.447
I don't care who sees me.

01:14:04.623 --> 01:14:05.954
Come on, get up.

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:07.752
Not until you say yes.

01:14:07.926 --> 01:14:09.894
Yes. Get up.

01:14:18.403 --> 01:14:21.133
What's up, man?
I thought we was going for a ride.

01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:28.969
Hey, I got something I want you to see.

01:14:29.148 --> 01:14:30.809
Come on.

01:14:31.783 --> 01:14:33.842
It's great. It's great.
You're gonna love it.

01:14:34.019 --> 01:14:36.112
Yo, Bobby.
- Hey, Nat.

01:14:36.288 --> 01:14:38.518
Man, you went out, man.

01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:41.352
I can't believe my boy went out
like that.

01:14:57.643 --> 01:14:59.543
Oh, hardwood floors.
Yes.

01:14:59.711 --> 01:15:02.475
But it's bigger than hardwood floors.
This is really big.

01:15:02.648 --> 01:15:04.809
You gotta get ready.
It's bigger than gigantic.

01:15:04.983 --> 01:15:07.850
Gigantic.
- This is the biggest thing. It is so big.

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:13.356
- One, two, three, surprise!
- One, two, three, surprise!

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.889
What do you think?

01:15:17.663 --> 01:15:19.028
Well...

01:15:19.198 --> 01:15:21.359
...I think it's great.

01:15:21.533 --> 01:15:23.558
- But what is it?
- What is it?

01:15:23.735 --> 01:15:26.829
It's what you've always wanted.
It's your own club.

01:15:27.039 --> 01:15:29.473
The Halloran brothers agreed to put up
all the money.

01:15:29.641 --> 01:15:32.667
If you do the work,
they split the profits with you fifty-fifty.

01:15:32.844 --> 01:15:34.436
What do you say?

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.471
I say yes.

01:15:39.117 --> 01:15:42.018
It's all in a day's work, babydoll.
Me and Waymon hooked it up.

01:15:42.187 --> 01:15:44.155
It's a business-type thing,
you know?

01:15:44.323 --> 01:15:47.656
Start getting busy on the business side,
ain't nothing we can't do.

01:15:47.826 --> 01:15:49.054
Start getting busy.

01:15:49.228 --> 01:15:50.889
Excuse...

01:15:51.063 --> 01:15:53.327
Yo, I did some shit too.

01:15:54.499 --> 01:15:57.297
There you go. Okay.
That's what I'm talking about.

01:15:57.469 --> 01:15:59.699
- Hey.
- Man, come on.

01:16:20.926 --> 01:16:23.087
Good night, Mr. Tinsdale.

01:16:29.868 --> 01:16:33.201
Hey, man. You still working?
We're going to be late.

01:16:33.372 --> 01:16:35.237
Hey, business first, right?

01:16:35.407 --> 01:16:37.398
I like the way you think.

01:16:38.644 --> 01:16:41.169
- You ready for this?
- Hey, I was born ready.

01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:44.281
You were born ready. Is that right?
- Yeah.

01:16:44.449 --> 01:16:46.917
Speaking of ready,
you seen Drake's new secretary?

01:16:47.085 --> 01:16:49.781
I already closed that deal.
- Yeah, well, she told me.

01:16:49.955 --> 01:16:53.482
- I think it's the suit.
- No, I think it's the paycheck.

01:16:53.659 --> 01:16:56.526
- Good night, Donna.
- Good night, Mr. Tinsdale. Mr. Johnson.

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.287
See you.

01:17:17.849 --> 01:17:19.373
Whoa! Are you ready for this?

01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:21.519
Ain't nothing to it,
but to do it, brother.

01:17:21.687 --> 01:17:23.018
- Let's go.
- Time to party.

01:17:23.188 --> 01:17:25.213
Hey, hey, what's happening, man?

01:17:26.792 --> 01:17:27.781
Okay.

01:17:27.959 --> 01:17:29.654
- What's up, chill?
- My man.

01:17:29.828 --> 01:17:34.322
Hey, how you living?
All right. All right.

01:17:34.599 --> 01:17:37.090
I see you.
Looking good.

01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:45.809
Now, don't forget. Don't forget.

01:17:45.977 --> 01:17:48.571
Hey, my man. My man, my man.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:50.840
You know, we gotta talk.

01:17:51.717 --> 01:17:53.241
I'll be back.

01:18:07.999 --> 01:18:09.330
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

01:18:09.501 --> 01:18:12.368
- I'm glad you came.
- All right.

01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:19.266
- You're gorgeous.
- Thank you.

01:18:19.444 --> 01:18:21.810
You don't look too bad yourself.

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:33.318
Excuse me.

01:18:33.492 --> 01:18:35.653
- Excuse me.
- Pardon, please.

01:18:35.927 --> 01:18:37.189
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.

01:18:37.362 --> 01:18:39.489
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

01:18:39.664 --> 01:18:41.723
And what is so damn funny?
Let us in.

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:43.993
- This ain't for you, all right?
- The nerve.

01:18:44.169 --> 01:18:47.195
I demand to see somebody in charge.

01:18:47.372 --> 01:18:50.136
Oh, man, perfect timing.
These ladies wanna talk to you.

01:18:50.308 --> 01:18:52.742
Aha. Ah!

01:18:52.911 --> 01:18:55.379
If it isn't
Teenage Mutant Negro Chicken Legs.

01:18:55.547 --> 01:18:58.516
- Taxi. Oh, excuse us.
- Excuse us.

01:18:59.017 --> 01:19:02.009
Damn, she could Hula-Hoop
with a damn Cheerio, couldn't she?

01:19:02.854 --> 01:19:05.414
That's right, get out of here. See you.
