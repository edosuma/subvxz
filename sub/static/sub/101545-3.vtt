Except for the night you left

15:26.621 --> 15:31.017
- An outcast.
- He got what he deserved.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.236
Why would my mother lie to me?

15:33.236 --> 15:35.978
I do not know
the answer to that.

15:35.978 --> 15:39.068
But, Talon,
without Sai-vek Redwan,

15:39.068 --> 15:40.461
none of this
would be possible.

15:40.461 --> 15:43.290
I am sorry
if I have opened old wounds.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.379
That was not my intention
when I mentioned your father.

15:49.905 --> 15:53.517
He'’s such a coward.
He should have stayed and
actually protected his family

15:53.517 --> 15:55.302
instead of hiding
in another world.

16:04.224 --> 16:07.140
If there'’s a message in here,
I'’m not seeing it.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.490
It'’s all just genealogies,

16:09.490 --> 16:12.972
proceedings of councils,
some old records.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.323
Well, maybe there'’s a code
or a hidden pattern.

16:24.070 --> 16:27.116
What'’s this word?
I'’m not familiar
with this one.

16:29.597 --> 16:30.685
More here.

16:34.906 --> 16:37.039
- Erection?
- What?

16:37.039 --> 16:39.128
I think it means "erection."

16:39.128 --> 16:42.218
"The erection of
the citadel was halted
during the flood years."

16:42.218 --> 16:45.743
Right. Thank you.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.528
Makes more sense
in correct context.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.530
- Are you all right?
- Mm-hmm.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.271
Is it your arm?
You seem feverish.

16:51.271 --> 16:52.794
- I can hear your
heart pounding.
- No, no.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.056
Eyes on the wall, please.
Let'’s keep reading.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.191
I'’m sorry I stole your lab.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.758
You must have thought
I was such a hag.

17:00.758 --> 17:03.065
Harpy, actually.
I called you a harpy.

17:03.065 --> 17:06.634
Oh. I guess that'’s fair
because I did call you
an ineffectual coward.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.157
Oh, really?
Well, I guess we'’re even then.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.898
Even, except I did
steal your lab.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.769
Except that you apologized,

17:11.769 --> 17:13.336
so I assume you'’re going to
give me it back.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.121
Not necessarily,
but I will grant you access.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.818
Access to my own lab?

17:16.818 --> 17:18.689
Until we open the gateway
to the other world,

17:18.689 --> 17:20.300
then you'’ll be rid of me
and you'’ll have the lab
all to yourself.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.171
Fine.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.044
We'’ll share the lab.

17:29.613 --> 17:33.356
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'’m just, uh--

17:33.356 --> 17:36.577
I'’m just feeling
a little faint.

17:37.969 --> 17:40.015
We'’re running out of air.

17:40.015 --> 17:42.017
We'’ll suffocate if we don't
find a way out of here.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.976
Put out the torch.
Talon, put out the torch.
Fire burns air.

17:44.976 --> 17:48.197
Put out the torch.
Everyone stay calm.
Don'’t panic.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.808
It makes you breathe harder.
Don'’t breathe.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.681
Janzo, we have to breathe.
We can'’t just stop
and do nothing.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.596
Well, obviously,
but all these writings,
the endless writings,

17:55.596 --> 17:57.467
well, they'’re just useless,
aren'’t they, Talon?

17:57.467 --> 17:59.078
We just need to think.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.993
Better think fast
or we'’ll end up like them.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.627
You know, I, um,
I once fantasized about

18:26.627 --> 18:29.760
you and I being trapped
in a room together, but, uh,

18:29.760 --> 18:34.417
it'’s, uh, not quite
as I imagined.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.027
Keep it together, Janzo.

18:36.027 --> 18:37.246
Keep that brain
of yours working

18:37.246 --> 18:39.640
to try and get us
out of here.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.643
I wonder who would survive
longer without air,

18:42.643 --> 18:45.167
Blackbloods or humans, hmm?

18:45.167 --> 18:46.951
It'’s probably Blackbloods.

18:46.951 --> 18:49.780
There'’s a way out of here.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.218
You can find it.
Just think.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.481
It'’s over, Talon.
Just accept it.

18:58.093 --> 19:01.444
You should probably
put out that torch.

19:01.444 --> 19:04.099
It might buy us
five more minutes of air.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.691
[ rustling ]

19:41.092 --> 19:43.443
Starflower ink.

19:43.443 --> 19:44.270
Janzo.

20:11.297 --> 20:15.083
Both: "Life and death
are the same piece of thread

20:15.083 --> 20:17.781
viewed from different sides."

20:45.287 --> 20:48.072
[ grunts ]
What kind of sick game is this?

20:48.072 --> 20:50.205
It was meant to divide us.

20:50.205 --> 20:53.817
"Life and death
viewed from different sides."

21:01.085 --> 21:03.740
- Talon: The door'’s closing.
- Wren, we have to go now. Come.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.395
- We can'’t just leave
them here to die.
- But you cannot help them.

21:06.395 --> 21:07.962
There'’s no sense in us
all dying for nothing. Come.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.790
No. There has to be
another way.

21:09.790 --> 21:13.315
- Wren.
- It was nice getting
to know you.

21:13.315 --> 21:16.100
- Shut up and find a way
to get you out of here.
- Wren, you have to go.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.711
- Life or death.
- Wren.

21:17.711 --> 21:18.973
We'’d already be dead
without their help.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.540
You have to leave them.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.976
This mission is
too important to fail.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.107
- Life or death.
- Come.

21:23.107 --> 21:24.326
No. Life or death.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.110
- Wren!
- No, I have to stay.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.027
Wren, please.

21:33.814 --> 21:34.641
Good-bye, Wren.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.646
- [ grunting ]
- No!

21:41.038 --> 21:43.911
No! No!

21:43.911 --> 21:46.609
You would have killed us all.
It was a test!

21:53.964 --> 21:58.491
"Life or death viewed
from different sides."

21:58.491 --> 22:01.450
If you'’d had left,
we would have all been dead
on either side of that door.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.108
You were going to
leave me here to die.

22:07.108 --> 22:12.069
Yes, for the sake
of our people.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.941
It was the only
rational choice to make.

22:16.422 --> 22:17.988
Apparently not.

22:31.785 --> 22:32.655
Talon?

22:48.628 --> 22:50.673
You weren'’t going
to leave me?

22:50.673 --> 22:53.372
I was lightheaded
from near suffocation.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.352
Hmm. What'’s all this?

23:17.352 --> 23:20.616
Last time I checked,
we were not on friendly terms.

23:20.616 --> 23:24.228
Why do you so dislike me, Zed?
Ever since we first met?

23:24.228 --> 23:25.969
Ah, yes, I remember it well.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.318
Vikka and I had just
saved your life,

23:27.318 --> 23:29.146
and then you banished us.

23:29.146 --> 23:33.673
Because I sensed
that you were using Talon,
and I was right.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.501
You manipulated
and betrayed her.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.503
I had a responsibility
to my people,

23:37.503 --> 23:39.809
something I think
you can relate to.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.682
The difference is
I don'’t cause pain and death
to everyone you care about.

23:42.682 --> 23:44.945
I'’m saving you
from your own mistakes.

23:44.945 --> 23:47.338
If I didn'’t stop Tobin
returning with an army,

23:47.338 --> 23:49.166
how many lives would be lost?

23:49.166 --> 23:51.604
Lu-Qiri would kill thousands.

23:51.604 --> 23:54.171
They would start with
every man in this Outpost.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.303
Pardon me.

24:03.093 --> 24:04.791
How clumsy of me.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.364
Tea tastes a bit off,
doesn'’t it?

24:13.364 --> 24:15.366
Probably does.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.806
Janzo prepared it for me
a while ago.

24:19.806 --> 24:22.243
You know, at the time,
I said I had no use for poison,

24:22.243 --> 24:25.986
but here we are.

24:25.986 --> 24:28.728
What have you done?

24:28.728 --> 24:31.121
If I die, the Blackfist
will slaughter your people.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.254
So listen very carefully

24:33.254 --> 24:35.778
because you have exactly
one day to take the antidote

24:35.778 --> 24:38.694
or else it'’s all over for you.

24:38.694 --> 24:41.697
Call back your demon
immediately.

24:41.697 --> 24:45.222
It'’s too late.
This ring isn'’t magic.

24:45.222 --> 24:47.790
It'’s a whistle.
Yes, the sound carries far,

24:47.790 --> 24:49.575
perhaps even beyond
the Outpost walls,

24:49.575 --> 24:51.141
but Vikka is way past that.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.100
He'’s been gone
since yesterday.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.102
I don'’t believe you.
Call him.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.846
[ blows whistle ]

25:06.113 --> 25:09.638
As I said, it'’s too late.
It won'’t work.

25:09.638 --> 25:11.466
You better think of something

25:11.466 --> 25:13.729
because now your life is tied
to the fate of Lord Tobin.

25:18.821 --> 25:21.258
- Give me the antidote.
- A life for a life.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.608
That'’s Blackblood justice,
isn'’t it?

25:22.608 --> 25:24.740
What was I supposed
to do about Tobin?

25:24.740 --> 25:27.874
An army showing up
would cause hundreds
of deaths on both sides.

25:27.874 --> 25:30.877
- Killing me won'’t
bring Tobin back.
- No, it won'’t.

25:30.877 --> 25:33.314
So instead,
you'’re going to release me,
free my people,

25:33.314 --> 25:34.576
and give us back this Outpost.

25:34.576 --> 25:37.274
If I fail to deliver
on your demands?

25:37.274 --> 25:38.798
Then you'’ll be dead
by this time tomorrow.

25:40.495 --> 25:41.670
Guards!

25:45.500 --> 25:47.676
Search the entire room.
Tear the whole place apart
if you have to.

25:47.676 --> 25:50.984
- Searching for what?
- The antidote to the poison
I just drank.

26:08.523 --> 26:11.744
I'’m really looking forward
to seeing my old friends
in Aegisford.

26:11.744 --> 26:15.312
Jarom-- my friend Jarom,
you think I eat a lot?

26:15.312 --> 26:17.445
Jarom can eat me
under the table

26:17.445 --> 26:19.708
and then eat
the table itself.

26:19.708 --> 26:22.145
- Munt, can I ask you
a question?
- Yeah.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.147
When you were living
in Aegisford,

26:24.147 --> 26:25.453
what did people say about me?

26:25.453 --> 26:28.238
- About you?
- Yeah.

26:28.238 --> 26:31.546
Nothing, yeah. Really.

26:31.546 --> 26:36.551
- Why?
- No reason really.

26:36.551 --> 26:41.730
It was just, I'’m not sure
I was liked very much
when I was there.

26:41.730 --> 26:44.037
- No.
- I mean, I was drunk
all the time.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.081
- No.
- I was mean.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.735
You?

26:46.735 --> 26:49.956
- No.
- Just a bit of an ass.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.179
They thought
you were a huge ass.

26:56.179 --> 26:57.877
Huge.

27:00.488 --> 27:01.489
Thanks, Munt.

27:05.406 --> 27:06.799
You want to hear
some things they said?

27:26.383 --> 27:28.559
There'’s my kingdom, Munt.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.431
Aegisford lies
just over that hill.

27:30.431 --> 27:33.652
Excellent.
They make good alethere.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.480
- More boar?
- Ugh. No, thanks.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.873
I can'’t believe
you'’re still eating.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.570
I can'’t let it go to waste,
now can I?

27:39.570 --> 27:42.486
There'’s only so much boar
a man can eat and then--

27:42.486 --> 27:43.792
- [ growling ]
- Demon?

27:43.792 --> 27:45.402
Not me.
I ain'’t ever eat demon.

27:45.402 --> 27:47.491
- No, there.
- [ snarling ]

27:47.491 --> 27:49.363
- Is that--
- It'’s a demon.

27:49.363 --> 27:53.193
- You think it came for us?
- Yes, you idiot. Now run!

27:58.198 --> 27:59.460
Munt, come on!

27:59.460 --> 28:01.244
[ roaring ]

28:01.244 --> 28:02.898
Let'’s go!

[ growling ]

28:06.293 --> 28:08.425
[ snarling ]

28:13.822 --> 28:18.392
- Okay. Any ideas?
- Why would I have an idea?
I'’m an idiot, remember?

28:18.392 --> 28:21.395
Now'’s not the time, Munt.
This thing wants to kill us.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.876
I guess I'’ll die
an idiot then.

28:23.876 --> 28:26.661
I'’m sorry.
You'’re not an idiot,
okay, Munt?

28:26.661 --> 28:29.620
- I'’m sorry.
- Oh.

28:29.620 --> 28:33.712
Oh, I have an idea.
Hey, boy.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.278
Are you hungry, boy?

28:36.410 --> 28:38.194
There you go. Eat.

28:38.194 --> 28:40.283
- Tobin:
Okay, that didn'’t work.
- [ roars ]

28:41.981 --> 28:46.028
[ whimpering ]

28:47.900 --> 28:50.554
- [ grunts ]
- [ roars ]

28:57.518 --> 29:00.695
- Munt the Mighty!
- [ screeching ]

29:08.616 --> 29:10.531
I should have said,
"Hammer of the gods!"
And then...

29:10.531 --> 29:11.401
[ sighs ]

29:15.449 --> 29:17.625
- That'’s one tough beastie.
- I think we better
run again, Munt.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.105
Run! Run!

29:27.330 --> 29:28.331
Keep going, Munt!

29:41.997 --> 29:44.304
Horses!
We need those horses!

29:44.304 --> 29:47.960
I'’m Lord Aegisford.
I need your horses now!

29:47.960 --> 29:50.614
- Who?
- Lord Aegisford.
I own these lands.

29:50.614 --> 29:53.617
- Aegisford is dead.
- No, I'’m not. I was gone,
but now I'’m back.

29:53.617 --> 29:55.010
- They'’re not for sale.
- What?

29:55.010 --> 29:57.099
- My horses.
- I'’m not buying them.

29:57.099 --> 29:59.667
- Yeah, like I said.
- Let me try.

29:59.667 --> 30:04.106
Noble woodcutter,
we beseech these horses.

30:04.106 --> 30:07.893
There is a demon with
huge horns and sharp teeth.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.373
- He'’s coming.
- Something wrong with him?

30:10.373 --> 30:12.593
- I haven'’t got time for this.
- Oh, it'’s too late.
There it is.

30:12.593 --> 30:15.422
- [ horse whinnies ]
- [ roaring ]

30:15.422 --> 30:18.555
- Get up.
- Ah.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.340
I'’ve never rode
a horsebefore, Tobin.

30:20.340 --> 30:23.473
- Then you better learn quick.
- Oh.

30:23.473 --> 30:25.171
Okay.
How do you make him go?

30:25.171 --> 30:26.302
Go!

30:26.302 --> 30:31.133
[ roaring, snarling ]

30:49.978 --> 30:52.415
[ rumbling ]

31:03.383 --> 31:06.560
"Life is death.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.562
Death is life.

31:08.562 --> 31:12.609
Only the gods can say
who will live or die."

31:12.609 --> 31:16.875
This is it. Right here.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.007
Now it is my turn
to pass the test.

31:19.007 --> 31:19.878
[ clicking ]

31:27.407 --> 31:32.151
- Your arm.
- I'’m all right.
It is just a-- ah!

31:34.022 --> 31:36.242
Every room
is designed to kill us,
this whole place.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.331
It isn'’t a vault,
it'’s a tomb.

31:38.331 --> 31:41.377
Not exactly.
There'’s a pattern
to all of this.

31:41.377 --> 31:45.033
All the traps are designed
to weed out the bad people.

31:45.033 --> 31:47.601
- What do you mean?
- If Janzo hadn'’t been willing
to sacrifice his arm.

31:47.601 --> 31:51.039
If Wren were the type of person
to leave people to die.

31:51.039 --> 31:54.564
If we were evil or selfish,
we would have all been dead.

31:54.564 --> 31:56.610
But she did nothing wrong.

31:56.610 --> 32:00.440
What could be so bad
about having the courage
to take the first step?

32:00.440 --> 32:03.225
Maybe they just wanted to keep
the kinj right where it is.

32:03.225 --> 32:04.618
Maybe it'’s a test
of worthiness.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.446
Someone who can
get through this gauntlet

32:06.446 --> 32:09.710
would have to be very smart
and very physically adept.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.976
- I can get through it.
- What? No, I'’m not
going to let you go.

32:14.976 --> 32:18.501
Do we have any other option?
We can'’t go back.
The only way is forward.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.460
And out of the four of us,
I'’m the only one
who might make it.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.375
Janzo:
What if you end up like
one of these three, eh?

32:22.375 --> 32:25.378
With your body cut in half,
head chopped off,

32:25.378 --> 32:26.727
riddled with darts?

32:26.727 --> 32:28.424
Poisonous darts.

32:28.424 --> 32:29.948
If Talon doesn'’t go,
I'’m going.

32:32.559 --> 32:35.823
All right, we know
about the darts part.
Can you figure out the rest?

32:35.823 --> 32:39.914
Talon, why are you
doing this to-- okay.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.525
All right.
Darts from the right,
then left.

32:42.525 --> 32:45.964
Rotating blades high and low
from both sides of the walls.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.924
Next, there is a blade,
a big blade coming out
of that slit in the ceiling,

32:49.924 --> 32:54.711
and then all I can see is
painted figures on the walls.

32:54.711 --> 32:57.976
I can'’t see very clearly.
Talon, this is dangerous.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.194
If you die...

33:19.823 --> 33:23.001
You did it.
I can'’t believe you did it.

33:23.001 --> 33:23.871
What do you see, Talon?

33:29.094 --> 33:30.573
"Death is life."

33:37.276 --> 33:38.755
"Life is death."

33:38.755 --> 33:41.845
"Only the gods will say
who lives or dies."

33:59.907 --> 34:00.908
How'’d you know which way to go?

34:00.908 --> 34:03.650
Death is life,

34:03.650 --> 34:05.956
so I chose the death side.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.876
I think I'’ve found
the lost Blackblood city.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.025
Janzo:
Talon, don'’t move!

34:48.303 --> 34:49.174
Ooh.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.747
She did it.
She'’s incredible.

34:57.747 --> 35:01.882
Yes. She opened
the whole path out of here.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.023
Wren: Spectacular.

35:14.764 --> 35:17.985
[ panting ]

35:17.985 --> 35:21.162
There. There it is.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.342
The kinj.

35:27.342 --> 35:30.040
Maybe you should let Wren
take the kinj.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.695
You still might not make it.

35:32.695 --> 35:35.829
That is my obligation.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.179
It is my burden to carry.

35:38.179 --> 35:41.051
[ panting ]

35:51.366 --> 35:55.501
[ gasping ]

36:29.274 --> 36:30.797
And it is done.

36:30.797 --> 36:34.017
I didn'’t realize.

36:34.017 --> 36:36.933
Mother, are you all right?

36:36.933 --> 36:40.546
Yes. I am wonderful.

36:42.025 --> 36:43.462
My sweet child.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.118
- Thank you, Jonesy-o.
- Janzo.

36:48.118 --> 36:50.338
- Thank you, Talon.
- You can thank me

36:50.338 --> 36:52.732
once we see this paradise
you'’ve spoken of.

36:52.732 --> 36:53.994
You have the kinj, now use it.

36:53.994 --> 36:55.952
Yes, Mother, open the portal.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.650
Show us what
we'’ve accomplished.

37:00.043 --> 37:02.481
I cannot wait
to show you all.

37:02.481 --> 37:05.527
But not here. Not yet.

37:05.527 --> 37:07.660
- Why not?
- Because it is not yet time.

37:09.618 --> 37:12.186
What exactly does
your kinj do, Yavalla?

37:12.186 --> 37:14.536
Talon, I told you.

37:14.536 --> 37:17.409
It takes us to paradise.

37:34.077 --> 37:36.515
- [ grunting ]
- Come on.

37:36.515 --> 37:37.994
- [ whinnying ]
- Whoa.

37:37.994 --> 37:38.995
We'’ve arrived safe and sound.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.606
Oh, not me. My arse hurts.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.351
- Ah.
- My Lord.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.918
- Captain.
- Jarom!

37:48.918 --> 37:51.486
- Get over here! Ha-ha.
- Munt.

37:51.486 --> 37:52.661
- Ah, Jarom.
- You'’ve come back to us.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.533
Yes, I have. Ha-ha.

37:54.533 --> 37:57.753
- Lumus!
- Munt. Good timing.

37:57.753 --> 38:00.974
- It'’s almost supper.
- Oh, good. I'’ve worked up
quite an appetite.

38:00.974 --> 38:04.064
- [ chuckles ]
- How is this even possible?

38:04.064 --> 38:06.066
Gods, Munt,
That poor horse.

38:06.066 --> 38:08.590
Captain, there'’s no time
for pleasantries.

38:08.590 --> 38:11.376
We'’re on the Queen's mission,
and there'’s a demon
on the loose.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.334
- Go on, there. Go.
- Hey, Captain,

38:13.334 --> 38:16.250
when we'’re inside, have them
send a bird to the Queen,

38:16.250 --> 38:17.295
a coded message
that I'’ve arrived safe.

38:21.386 --> 38:25.433
[ crowd murmuring ]

38:25.433 --> 38:31.004
And so, the dark days
of affliction are over.

38:31.004 --> 38:34.834
The subjugation of the humans
at the Outpost is at an end.

38:34.834 --> 38:37.315
Queen Rosmund will
return to her throne,

38:37.315 --> 38:39.839
and you, my people,

38:39.839 --> 38:43.016
we shall prepare
to leave the Outpost.

38:43.016 --> 38:48.543
Blackbloods, humans,
a new era has begun.

38:50.893 --> 38:54.244
Blackbloods leaving
the Outpost?

38:54.244 --> 38:56.290
I'’ll believe it when I see it.

38:59.989 --> 39:00.860
Not too soon, I hope.

39:15.875 --> 39:19.661
I received a bird.
Tobin made it safely.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.489
Thank you for calling off
your demon.

39:21.489 --> 39:24.231
I did nothing of the sort.

39:24.231 --> 39:26.146
Well, since Tobin is alive,
where it the antidote?

39:26.146 --> 39:29.671
The antidote for what?
Willow bark?

39:29.671 --> 39:31.456
- I beg your pardon?
- Willow bark.

39:31.456 --> 39:34.328
Janzo distills it
for my headaches.

39:34.328 --> 39:37.723
So to be clear,
what you put in my drink
wasn'’t poison?

39:37.723 --> 39:41.509
No. Tastes awful,
but it'’s harmless, really.

39:41.509 --> 39:43.903
- You were bluffing.
- I'’m a champion Octor player.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.992
You'’re a devious snake.

39:45.992 --> 39:47.515
Takes one to know one, Zed.

39:51.432 --> 39:54.609
Queen Rosmund,
may I have a word?

39:59.092 --> 40:04.924
We would not have succeeded
without the invaluable help
of one they call Janzo.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.708
Such a brilliant mind.

40:06.708 --> 40:09.755
And Talon,
I have never seen
such abilities.

40:09.755 --> 40:12.758
Yes, you would be wise to
make friends with them both.

40:12.758 --> 40:15.151
I have never wanted it
any other way.

40:15.151 --> 40:18.938
And now you will see
how truly I keep my promises.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.287
- [ gasps ]
- [ ghostly whispering ]

40:20.287 --> 40:21.767
There'’s still a lot more
that has to be done.

40:24.334 --> 40:25.553
What is it?
Are you all right?

40:25.553 --> 40:28.208
[ ghostly whispering ]

40:35.868 --> 40:38.740
Yes, it has passed.

40:38.740 --> 40:42.265
Rosmund, give me your hand.

40:46.052 --> 40:47.706
Don'’t! Let go of me.

41:01.067 --> 41:02.590
You see?

41:04.026 --> 41:06.028
Now we are at peace.

41:07.769 --> 41:09.467
I'’m so glad
you have joined us.

41:10.946 --> 41:13.471
As am I.

41:13.471 --> 41:17.779
Now I see with your eyes,

41:17.779 --> 41:18.780
hear with your ears.

41:18.780 --> 41:21.261
I think with your mind.

41:21.261 --> 41:22.958
And I feel with your heart.

41:22.958 --> 41:25.831
Tomorrow we will begin the work
amongst both our people.

41:27.093 --> 41:28.050
Interesting.

41:32.011 --> 41:33.534
Garret Spears is still alive.

41:35.580 --> 41:39.671
- Yes.
- Rosmund, you must find him.

41:39.671 --> 41:42.456
I cannot risk him
skulking about,

41:42.456 --> 41:44.632
possibly murdering
more of my people.

41:47.940 --> 41:50.638
He must join us.

41:52.422 --> 41:53.859
Yes, High Priestess.
