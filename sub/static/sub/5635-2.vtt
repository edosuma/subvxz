It makes me sick! I like the Land Ship.

Look! Ghost Boy!

00:36.452 --> 00:38.654
- There's one in the boys' locker room, too.
- I know.

00:38.688 --> 00:41.688
- What?
- What? I just heard... about it.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.327
there has been a rash of graffiti

at school and in our community.

And I'm here to tell
you all the story of...

01:27.069 --> 01:28.420
- KIDS: The Land Ship.
- The Land Ship!

01:28.454 --> 01:30.706
Correct. Even though I had cholera...

01:30.740 --> 01:32.074
(coughs)

01:32.108 --> 01:33.876
... I played a big part in the battle

01:33.910 --> 01:35.911
that made this ship famous.

01:35.945 --> 01:39.314
I didn't know cholera made
you boring and old and a man.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.283
The British were going to attack.

01:41.317 --> 01:44.887
Our town had only one
small ship protecting us.

01:44.921 --> 01:48.624
My idea was to move the frigate onto land.

01:48.658 --> 01:50.893
The night of the British attack was humid

01:50.927 --> 01:52.928
and filled with great tension.

01:52.962 --> 01:55.163
- (whispering): Just like my farts.
- Shh, Gene.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.400
The townspeople dragged
the ship up onto shore,

We lit the lights on the ship,

02:07.977 --> 02:09.478
hoisted the sail

02:09.512 --> 02:11.346
and rocked the ship back and forth

02:11.381 --> 02:13.916
to make it seem like it was on the water.

02:13.950 --> 02:15.951
When the British sailed in to attack,

02:15.985 --> 02:17.920
they misjudged the coastline

02:17.954 --> 02:21.089
and ran aground before
they could fire a shot.

A peaceful end to a dangerous situation.

- You can move your restaurant.
- No, I can't.

these books up so I can't see you.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.917
- Okay.

the rush is so good?

06:10.226 --> 06:12.427

- And Ghost Boy's supposed to be you?

06:12.462 --> 06:14.096
No, it's... it's just something I draw.

06:14.130 --> 06:16.598
Oh, I thought maybe because
you feel invisible like a ghost

06:16.633 --> 06:18.467
- since you don't have any friends.
- What?

06:18.501 --> 06:20.202
Also, the ghost is shaped like a "J."

06:20.236 --> 06:22.104
Oh, my God.<i> I'm</i> shaped like a "J."

- Oh, right.

06:25.975 --> 06:27.776
- You're really smart, huh?
- Very.

06:27.810 --> 06:30.045
So do we blow on it now to dry it,

06:30.079 --> 06:32.180
or does it just dry on its own, or... ?

06:32.215 --> 06:34.049
Oh, no. We have to run away now.

06:34.083 --> 06:35.650
(both panting) Good idea.

06:35.668 --> 06:37.502
They'll never suspect us if we're running.

06:38.654 --> 06:40.672
The good Porta Potti

07:02.895 --> 07:04.512

Ah, da, da, da, da! This
is not to be admired!

07:16.025 --> 07:17.709
You saying that makes me admire it more.

07:17.744 --> 07:19.828
Oh, uh, then look at that great graffiti!

07:19.862 --> 07:21.330

- It's Tom Petty.

Tom Petty! Back down? Don't back down?

07:54.730 --> 07:56.448

07:56.499 --> 07:58.000
(laughing): Take you to
the gates of Hell? Right?

07:58.084 --> 08:00.202
- "American Girl."
- "American Girl." Do you have a speakerphone?

08:00.236 --> 08:02.120
- No, Teddy.
- Do you have another extension down here?

08:02.570 --> 08:04.637
The song ended. It's the B-52's now.

- "Love Shack."

08:06.240 --> 08:07.706
They're playing all the hits!

08:07.742 --> 08:10.675
So, you want to go out
tagging again tonight?

08:10.711 --> 08:12.611
Yes. We're a tag team. Get it?

08:12.646 --> 08:13.979
- That's a good one.
- Thanks.

08:14.014 --> 08:16.290
LOUISE: Hi, Jordan, who
we've never eaten lunch with

08:16.317 --> 08:18.083
before ever. What's up?

08:18.119 --> 08:20.486
- Nothing.
- Um... Jordan's a friend.

08:20.521 --> 08:22.321
Jordan, you are a delight.

08:22.356 --> 08:24.423
Now you're my friend,
and friends share fries.

08:24.459 --> 08:26.959
So, Jor-jo. That's what I call you now.

08:26.994 --> 08:28.627
You guys got super lunchy super fast.

08:28.663 --> 08:30.029
What's your secret, Jay-jams?

08:30.064 --> 08:32.198
- You gave me two nicknames.
- Yup.

08:32.232 --> 08:34.600
- Which one do you like better?
- I guess "Jay-jams."

08:34.635 --> 08:36.101
- Jor-jo.
- Jor-jo?

08:36.136 --> 08:37.602
I'm gonna call you "Damn Jam."

08:37.638 --> 08:39.772
- Um, I got to get going.
- He seems great.

08:39.807 --> 08:42.475
Tina, when did you start
hanging out with Jordan?

08:42.510 --> 08:43.708
I got to get going.

08:43.744 --> 08:45.211
It's just you and me now.

08:45.246 --> 08:47.680
- Yup.
- Oh. I was talking to the taco.

08:53.754 --> 08:56.889
♪ Sneaking out at night ♪

08:58.092 --> 09:02.895
♪ Doing wrong feels right. ♪

09:02.930 --> 09:05.531
Land Ship parade tomorrow!

09:05.566 --> 09:07.299
- Here it comes.
- Mm.

09:07.335 --> 09:09.368
Hey, the city could
change their mind, right?

09:09.403 --> 09:11.370
Get a last-minute call from the governor?

09:11.405 --> 09:13.305
- Make a little Porta Potti pardon?
- Mm.

09:13.341 --> 09:14.807
(groans) Aah!

09:14.842 --> 09:16.242
Oh, my God, Tina! What happened?

09:16.277 --> 09:17.676
I fell asleep.

09:17.712 --> 09:19.345
I'll have what she's having.

09:19.380 --> 09:20.646
Tina, what's wrong? Are you sick?

09:20.681 --> 09:22.815
Yeah, why are you so tired all the time?

09:22.850 --> 09:24.416
That's like the fourth bowl of something

09:24.452 --> 09:26.051
you've fallen asleep in.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.987
Oh, I've just been having
trouble sleeping lately,

09:28.022 --> 09:29.822
'cause of... I'm so
excited about the Land Ship.

09:29.857 --> 09:31.724
Tina's got the Land Ship fever.

09:31.759 --> 09:33.325
Or she has a real fever.

09:33.361 --> 09:35.027
Can you just hold your hand
there for a second, Dad?

09:35.062 --> 09:37.763
I'm just gonna take a quick... (snoring)

09:38.198 --> 09:40.833
T...Tina, I can't... I
got to... I can't hold...

09:40.868 --> 09:42.668
Tina, I can't hold my hand here.

09:42.703 --> 09:44.236
You're spoiling her, Dad!

09:44.272 --> 09:45.704
You're right. I should just let go.

09:45.740 --> 09:47.506
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.

09:47.542 --> 09:48.908
I can't do it. Huh?

09:48.943 --> 09:50.876
- Nothing. Go back to sleep.
- Okay.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.746
Nice one. Thanks.

09:53.781 --> 09:55.548
I've been having so
much fun with you, Tina.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.684
Me, too. I mean, me
with you, not me with me.

09:58.719 --> 10:00.786
I've never spent this
much time with a girl.

10:00.821 --> 10:03.389
And I've never spent this
much time with my spicy side.

10:03.424 --> 10:04.790
(grunting)

10:04.825 --> 10:06.592
Whoa! Jordan, did you mean to do that?

10:06.627 --> 10:08.627
I sure did. That was my first kiss.

10:08.663 --> 10:10.396
I couldn't tell at all.

10:10.431 --> 10:13.399
It had a lot of the same things
that real kissing has in it.

10:13.434 --> 10:15.067
You inspire me, Tina.

10:15.102 --> 10:17.269
- You make me feel like I can do anything.
- You can!

10:17.305 --> 10:19.371
- You make me want to punch the air.
- Punch it!

10:19.407 --> 10:22.107
(grunts) You make me feel like I
can jump over this parking meter.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.642
That looks a little high.

10:23.678 --> 10:25.644
(grunting) Um...

10:25.680 --> 10:27.580
I want to maybe try
that again another time?

10:27.615 --> 10:29.615
- Okay. Yeah.
- Hey, listen,

10:29.650 --> 10:31.884
tonight we're gonna tag
something really special.

10:31.919 --> 10:33.986
- A greeting card?
- No, even better.

10:34.021 --> 10:35.921
The sail of the Land Ship.

10:35.957 --> 10:37.790
- Wait, what?
- Picture it...

10:37.825 --> 10:39.959
a giant Ghost Boy 20 feet tall.

10:39.994 --> 10:42.494
They unfurl the sail during the parade...

10:42.530 --> 10:45.097
Ghost Boy! The crowd is stunned.

10:45.132 --> 10:47.499
And we know it was us who did it.

10:47.535 --> 10:50.235
It's just seems like that's
really big and the Land Ship

10:50.271 --> 10:53.606
is important to history
and people'll be upset and

10:53.641 --> 10:54.974
we could go to jail and...

10:55.009 --> 10:56.475
Oh, you're kissing me again.

10:56.510 --> 10:57.977
You're so wild, Tina.

10:58.012 --> 10:59.511
Yeah, I am. Right?

10:59.547 --> 11:02.014
So, are you in or are you in?

11:02.049 --> 11:03.749
- I'm in.
- Should we kiss more?

11:03.784 --> 11:05.618
Yes, but let's work on a couple things.

11:05.653 --> 11:07.186
You don't have to cover my nose

11:07.221 --> 11:08.253
and my mouth with your mouth.

11:08.289 --> 11:09.355
(low grunting)

11:09.390 --> 11:10.856
You're still doing it.

11:10.891 --> 11:12.958
O...okay, just... You...

11:12.994 --> 11:14.994
(both grunting)

11:20.168 --> 11:23.035
<i>So tired. Got to look up
sails. Am I really going to tag</i>

11:23.071 --> 11:24.904
<i>the sail of the Land
Ship with Jordan?</i>

11:24.939 --> 11:26.906
<i>He is a bad kisser. But he's a bad boy,</i>

11:26.941 --> 11:28.841
<i>and I guess bad boys are bad kissers.</i>

11:28.876 --> 11:30.910
<i>Oh no. I just typed all that
into the search bar! Delete.</i>

11:30.945 --> 11:32.645
- <i>Delete.</i>
- So, everything is normal with you

11:32.680 --> 11:34.046
and you're not acting weird at all.

11:34.081 --> 11:35.681
Oh, good, I'm glad you think so.

11:35.716 --> 11:38.417
Except for what are you
looking at right now? Aha.

11:38.452 --> 11:39.418
Sails.

11:39.453 --> 11:40.552
Wait. Sails?

11:40.588 --> 11:42.154
Yeah. I've just always wondered

11:42.189 --> 11:44.256
what sailing was like, so now I know.

11:44.292 --> 11:45.858
And how do you explain this?

11:45.893 --> 11:48.327
I found it in your room.

11:48.362 --> 11:50.562
A bandana. Flair for your microphone stand?

11:50.598 --> 11:53.065
(gasps) You're joining Aerosmith!

11:53.100 --> 11:56.502
Guys. I just need to do
my sail reading. Please.

11:56.537 --> 11:59.571
Jordan. Sails. Tired. Bandana.

11:59.607 --> 12:00.773
All in one week.

12:00.808 --> 12:03.175
I'm gonna figure this out, Tina.

12:03.210 --> 12:05.077
You and Jordan are making tiny boats

12:05.112 --> 12:08.681
with bandana sails for
tiny, nocturnal animals.

12:08.716 --> 12:10.282
Oh! That's not it!

12:10.318 --> 12:11.684
But I'm gonna get it.

12:11.719 --> 12:13.352
- (bell jingling)
- Bobby's back.

12:13.387 --> 12:14.620
What'd the guy from the city say?

12:14.655 --> 12:15.888
Are they moving the stank tanks?

12:15.923 --> 12:17.923
- No, Teddy, they're not.
- Aw.

12:17.959 --> 12:20.292
In fact, when I explained
there were four Porta Pottis

12:20.328 --> 12:22.561
in front of my restaurant,
they said there should be five.

12:22.596 --> 12:25.397
They're adding another.

12:25.433 --> 12:27.366
You know what? If they
won't move them, I will.

12:27.401 --> 12:28.467
I'm gonna move 'em.

12:28.502 --> 12:29.601
- Yeah.
- Tonight.

12:29.637 --> 12:31.704
- Get 'em!
- Just like they moved the Land Ship.

12:31.739 --> 12:34.139
Under the cover of darkness. Let's do it.

12:34.175 --> 12:35.708
We'll rock 'em back and forth

12:35.743 --> 12:37.943
- and then slaughter everyone inside.
- Yeah.

12:37.979 --> 12:39.778
JORDAN: Tina, this is so intense.

12:39.814 --> 12:41.080
We're like Bonnie and Clyde.

12:41.115 --> 12:42.781
Didn't they get shot
at the end of the movie?

12:42.817 --> 12:44.083
Maybe say "spoiler"

12:44.118 --> 12:45.584
before you give away
the end of a movie, okay?

12:45.619 --> 12:46.752
(fluttering) Aah!

12:46.787 --> 12:48.220
- What was that?
- It was a pigeon.

12:48.255 --> 12:49.989
It wasn't a tiny flying security guard?

12:50.024 --> 12:52.124
No. Okay, let's hoist the sail.

12:52.159 --> 12:54.593
Okay. According to my notes,
first we have to announce

12:54.628 --> 12:56.328
we're raising it. For safety reasons.

12:56.364 --> 12:57.596
Raising the mainsail.

12:57.631 --> 12:59.665
Okay. Thank you for letting
me know. What's next?

12:59.700 --> 13:02.401
Then we pull on the halyard. And I think

13:02.436 --> 13:04.503
that's this. Um, okay, well,
that seems like a good start.

13:04.538 --> 13:05.771
Maybe we should, uh, go home

13:05.806 --> 13:07.606
and come back tomorrow, um,

13:07.641 --> 13:09.174
good night's sleep, and finish.

13:09.210 --> 13:10.476
(grunts) Little help?

13:10.511 --> 13:12.177
Oh, right.

13:12.213 --> 13:13.912
It's the perfect canvas.

13:13.948 --> 13:16.015
It's literally canvas.

13:16.050 --> 13:18.150
Almost too perfect to paint
on, right? Where are you going?

13:18.185 --> 13:20.252
Up the ladder? Okay, great, here I come.

13:20.287 --> 13:21.787
I'm totally on board with this.

13:21.822 --> 13:23.856
(groaning softly)

13:23.891 --> 13:25.491
You say something?

13:25.526 --> 13:28.761
No. (Continues groaning)

13:28.796 --> 13:30.763
I swear I keep hearing something.

13:30.798 --> 13:32.798
I don't hear anything. (Continues groaning)

13:35.202 --> 13:37.503
Whoa. We really did it.

13:37.538 --> 13:39.605
Yeah. So should we furl up the sail?

13:39.640 --> 13:40.973
- What?
- Furl up the sail.

13:41.008 --> 13:42.975
Oh, I thought you said go
back in time and not do this,

13:43.010 --> 13:44.376
but yeah, sure, let's get furlin'.

13:44.412 --> 13:45.944
LINDA: <i>Which shoes are better</i>

13:45.980 --> 13:48.380
for moving Porta Pottis,
Bob... flats or pumps?

13:48.416 --> 13:49.548
Flats, I guess.

13:49.583 --> 13:50.949
But why are you in a dress?

13:50.985 --> 13:52.518
It's the only black thing I own.

13:52.553 --> 13:55.054
You said to put on dark colors
so we blend in with the night.

13:55.089 --> 13:56.188
Okay, well, just hurry up.

13:56.223 --> 13:57.556
Teddy's gonna be here in a little bit.

13:57.591 --> 13:59.525
I just got to do my eye
makeup and curl my hair.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.026
Lin, you don't need makeup.

14:01.062 --> 14:02.694
But I want to do a smoky eye.

14:02.730 --> 14:04.196
I never get to dress up.

14:04.231 --> 14:05.831
See you tomorrow for the big reveal.

14:05.866 --> 14:07.066
Yeah. See ya.

14:07.101 --> 14:08.867
Wait. Aren't you forgetting something?

14:08.903 --> 14:11.236
Oh, yeah. (Low grunt)

14:11.272 --> 14:13.572
Bye. Mm...

14:14.675 --> 14:15.874
Oh, God.

14:15.910 --> 14:17.509
Wash it off, wash it off!

14:17.545 --> 14:18.710
What have you done?

14:18.746 --> 14:20.646
LOUISE: Exactly. Aah!

14:20.681 --> 14:23.482
We looked in the Porta Potti
and found a porta naughty.

14:23.517 --> 14:24.716
You've been sneaking out at night

14:24.752 --> 14:26.985
- to meet Jordan, haven't you?
- (Soft crying)

14:27.021 --> 14:28.854
- Wait, are you crying?
- I've been sneaking out

14:28.889 --> 14:30.989
because Jordan is Ghost Boy
and I've been helping him

14:31.025 --> 14:33.225
and then we did something
like kissing and then I ruined

14:33.260 --> 14:35.060
<i>Bonnie and Clyde for
him by saying they die</i>

14:35.096 --> 14:36.929
and then we painted a
giant Ghost Boy on the sail

14:36.964 --> 14:38.897
of the Land Ship and now the
parade is gonna be ruined.

14:38.933 --> 14:40.165
Because of me.

14:40.201 --> 14:41.600
Wait, wait, wait. What?

14:41.635 --> 14:43.435
Bonnie and Clyde die?

14:43.471 --> 14:46.038
Jordan is Ghost Boy and you're helping him?

14:46.073 --> 14:48.107
- Yes.
- Wow. I was way off.

14:48.142 --> 14:50.409
I thought it was the
bland leading the bland.

14:50.444 --> 14:53.345
I graffitied the Land Ship. What do I do?

14:53.380 --> 14:54.780
I wear white underwear. And, honey,

14:54.815 --> 14:56.615
what you need is some bleach.

14:56.650 --> 14:58.517
Wait, I got it. I can paint over it.

14:58.552 --> 15:00.686
I just need a bunch of white paint now,

15:00.721 --> 15:02.588
in the middle of the night,

15:02.623 --> 15:05.691
when paint stores aren't usually open.

15:05.726 --> 15:07.226
Wait a minute. You say "paint"

15:07.261 --> 15:09.528
and I say t'ain't no problem with that,

15:09.563 --> 15:11.697
because I know there's
some in the basement.

15:11.732 --> 15:13.465
Ta-da! Paint.

15:13.501 --> 15:14.633
And spackle.

15:14.668 --> 15:16.401
(gasps) How did you know about this, Gene?

15:16.437 --> 15:18.804
Let's just say I thought
this tarp was a tent

15:18.839 --> 15:21.206
and I thought that spackle
was marshmallow fluff.

15:21.242 --> 15:23.108
And I was right, in a way.

15:23.144 --> 15:24.643
I'm going back to the Land Ship.

15:24.678 --> 15:25.811
We're coming with you.

15:25.846 --> 15:28.447
Yeah. Let's go unpaint the town.

15:29.917 --> 15:31.884
(bell jingles softly)

15:36.590 --> 15:39.391
Where's Teddy? We need his
truck to move the Porta Pottis.

15:39.426 --> 15:40.859
This is so exciting.

15:40.895 --> 15:42.628
You know who would love this? The kids.

15:42.663 --> 15:43.896
Oh, yeah, you're right.

15:43.931 --> 15:46.398
- Should we wake 'em?
- No. Let 'em sleep.

15:46.433 --> 15:48.600
Plus we all might get arrested.

15:49.670 --> 15:51.136
Let's push these Pottis.

15:52.640 --> 15:56.108
- LOUISE: Tina, wow.
- I know.

15:56.143 --> 15:58.277
This isn't gonna work.
We don't have enough time.

15:58.312 --> 15:59.444
Great, let's get started.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.679
We're gonna get caught here.

16:00.714 --> 16:01.813
We're gonna get in trouble.

16:01.849 --> 16:04.449
I don't hear paint brushes.

16:04.485 --> 16:07.119
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, boy.
- More gas, Teddy.

16:07.154 --> 16:08.954
- More gas.
- So, faster?

16:08.989 --> 16:09.955
- Uh, uh, uh, easy.
- Yes, faster.

16:09.990 --> 16:11.523
- Faster. Punch it.
- Easy, easy.

16:11.559 --> 16:13.292
- Okay, punch it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

16:13.327 --> 16:14.927
- Teddy, don't listen to Linda, just go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:14.962 --> 16:16.028
Easy... No, no, no, no.

16:16.063 --> 16:17.696
- What am I doing?
- They're gonna push

16:17.731 --> 16:18.764
into each other and just

16:18.799 --> 16:20.165
slide right up the street.

16:20.201 --> 16:21.333
Bo... They're tipping.

16:21.368 --> 16:23.135
Oh, God, she's right. Teddy, stop.

16:23.170 --> 16:24.970
- Pull forward?
- Yeah, but not too quickly.

16:25.005 --> 16:27.940
- Quickly?
- Oh, they sloshed.

16:27.975 --> 16:30.709
(gags) Aw, that's not a good smell.

16:30.744 --> 16:32.211
Uh... I was never here.

16:32.246 --> 16:34.479
Love your dress, Linda. See you tomorrow.

16:34.515 --> 16:35.781
Oh, my God.

16:35.816 --> 16:37.149
They won, Bobby.

16:37.184 --> 16:39.318
The Porta Pottis won. Come to bed.

16:39.353 --> 16:41.486
LOUISE: Well, this is what's
known in the sailing world

16:41.522 --> 16:42.721
as "good enough".

16:42.756 --> 16:43.989
Oh, no. We missed a spot.

16:45.226 --> 16:46.225
Tina, we got to go.

16:46.260 --> 16:48.227
People in costumes are gonna be here soon.

16:48.262 --> 16:49.494
I'm going back up to get it.

16:49.530 --> 16:50.729
No. There's not enough time.

16:50.764 --> 16:51.863
I'm no scientist,

16:51.899 --> 16:54.032
but that looks like the sun coming up.

16:54.068 --> 16:55.534
I got to finish undoing what I did.

16:55.569 --> 16:57.536
(grunting)

16:57.571 --> 16:59.972
Can't quite reach.

17:00.007 --> 17:01.974
Someone's here. Tina, hurry up.

17:02.009 --> 17:04.742
(straining): Almost got it.

17:07.047 --> 17:09.714
Aah! The British are coming!

17:14.036 --> 17:15.502
(grunting)

17:15.537 --> 17:17.337
Last little spot.

17:17.372 --> 17:19.306
(whispering): Gene, what's
happening with the reenactors?

17:19.340 --> 17:20.540
They're eating breakfast burritos

17:20.576 --> 17:22.008
and doing gentle stretching.

17:22.044 --> 17:23.443
- (fife playing)
- Now they're fifing!

17:23.479 --> 17:25.545
Oh, my God, they're fifing toward us!

17:25.580 --> 17:28.048
(grunts) Got it. Done.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.016
(all grunting)

17:39.495 --> 17:40.727
LINDA: <i>Kids. Come on.</i>

17:40.762 --> 17:42.562
It's time for the Land Ship.

17:46.401 --> 17:49.600
Can I have a cup of coffee?
Or a hard slap in the face?

17:49.671 --> 17:51.473
No. And why are you all yawning so much?

17:52.508 --> 17:54.341
Why are <i> you</i> yawning?

17:54.376 --> 17:58.211
Because you were yawning,
so I... I... just yawned.

17:58.247 --> 17:59.412
So you're a copycat.

17:59.448 --> 18:00.647
Come on, let's go.

18:00.682 --> 18:02.215
If we miss the reenactment we're gonna

18:02.251 --> 18:03.850
have to reenact the reenactment.

18:03.886 --> 18:05.852
Yup. Let's go watch the ship set jail.

18:05.888 --> 18:07.220
I... I mean "fail." I mean "terrible secret."

18:07.256 --> 18:08.488
I mean "sail."

18:08.524 --> 18:10.423
Aw, puberty.

18:10.459 --> 18:12.325
(fifes playing a tune, crowd applauding)

18:12.361 --> 18:12.960
(Frond whoops)

18:13.339 --> 18:14.638
Patience!

18:14.674 --> 18:17.641
Patience Headbottom, hi!

18:18.845 --> 18:20.144
I, uh, know her.

18:22.014 --> 18:23.314
Here comes the Land Ship.

18:23.349 --> 18:25.049
I'm gonna rock you like that boat. Come on!

18:25.084 --> 18:26.951
- Aah, stop! Don't rock me, Zeke.
- Come on! (Exclaiming)

18:26.986 --> 18:28.986
- Too hard!
- Jordan. Oh, hey.

18:29.021 --> 18:30.287
- Uh, maybe you should go.
- What?

18:30.323 --> 18:32.022
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else

18:32.058 --> 18:33.991
but right here with you right now.

18:34.026 --> 18:35.926
Uh...

18:38.431 --> 18:40.698
All hands hoay.

18:40.733 --> 18:42.066
Rock it, boys.

18:42.101 --> 18:44.335
Raising the mainsail.

18:47.106 --> 18:48.172
This is it.

18:48.207 --> 18:49.907
Come here. I want to, um...

18:49.942 --> 18:51.742
kiss your eyes with my hands.

18:51.777 --> 18:53.577
Stop, silly. Wait.

18:54.747 --> 18:56.547
- What the hell?!
- Uh, yeah. What the hell?

18:56.582 --> 18:58.516
What happened to our giant Ghost Boy?

18:58.517 --> 19:00.400
I know. So much. What you said.

19:00.753 --> 19:03.053
We were up all night.
We made so many stencils.

19:03.089 --> 19:04.655
Well, we might as well enjoy the parade.

19:04.690 --> 19:06.657
Wait. Tina, did you do this?

19:06.692 --> 19:08.559
What? Yes, I did.

19:08.594 --> 19:10.561
Excuse you? <i> We</i> did.

19:10.596 --> 19:12.329
Yeah. We saw the sunrise.

19:12.365 --> 19:14.565
It was beautiful. I cried.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.966
Why, Tina, why?

19:16.112 --> 19:17.645
At first I liked doing graffiti with you,

19:17.680 --> 19:19.980
but then we went too
far. This just isn't me.

19:20.016 --> 19:22.283
It's not. Trust me, Jordan,
it's not. I know her.

19:22.318 --> 19:24.185
Hold on. Jordan, you're Ghost Boy?

19:24.220 --> 19:25.920
And Tina, you're a tag hag?

19:25.955 --> 19:27.154
<i>What?!</i>

19:27.190 --> 19:29.156
Yes. Yes, I'm Ghost Boy, okay?

19:29.192 --> 19:31.525
And Tina's my girlfriend,
or I thought she was.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.627
She went out with me
for the last five nights

19:33.663 --> 19:34.929
and we tagged the whole city.

19:34.964 --> 19:38.032
And we kissed. She was my first kiss.

19:38.067 --> 19:39.667
And my last.

19:39.702 --> 19:41.435
You painted over my heart, Tina.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.370
Jordan, someday you're
gonna meet a great girl

19:43.406 --> 19:44.638
who doesn't care about good kissing

19:44.674 --> 19:46.540
or the law or anything. I just know it.

19:46.576 --> 19:47.775
Whatever.

19:47.810 --> 19:49.276
- Hey, you're Ghost Boy?
- Yeah.

19:49.312 --> 19:50.878
Do you want to, like, um, hang out?

19:50.913 --> 19:52.146
Yeah.

19:52.181 --> 19:53.681
Oh, that was faster than I thought.

19:53.716 --> 19:55.883
Tina, you saved the Land Ship parade.

19:55.918 --> 19:58.619
Well, technically I ruined
it. But then I saved it.

19:58.654 --> 20:00.187
Girl, you got a dangerous streak

20:00.223 --> 20:02.790
<i>and</i> a not-dangerous streak. I like it.

20:02.825 --> 20:04.959
Tina, I have so much
more respect for you now.

20:04.994 --> 20:06.560
Thanks, Tammy. I still have the same amount

20:06.596 --> 20:09.296
of respect for you. Which is not much,

20:09.332 --> 20:10.698
but, um, forget it.

20:10.733 --> 20:13.234
- Wait, Tina, you went out with Jordan?
- Yeah.

20:13.269 --> 20:14.368
And you guys kissed?

20:14.403 --> 20:15.836
Well, it was sort of like kissing,

20:15.872 --> 20:17.638
but it was hard to breathe, um...

20:17.673 --> 20:18.973
Okay, I don't need the details.

20:19.008 --> 20:21.041
You want to watch the rest
of the parade together?

20:21.077 --> 20:23.010
Oh, I... I thought we
were watching it together.

20:23.045 --> 20:24.712
Yeah, but now we officially are.

20:24.747 --> 20:26.080
Okay.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.149
- (bell jingles)
- JIMMY: Ha. Look at the line

20:29.185 --> 20:31.519
in front of the Porta Pottis there, Bob.

20:31.554 --> 20:34.555
Never seen a line in
front of your place before.

20:34.590 --> 20:37.725
- 'Cause you never have a line.
- Yeah. All right, Trev.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.227
Oh, Jimmy will you p... Wait a second.

20:40.263 --> 20:42.096
Two more burgers of the day, Bob.

20:42.131 --> 20:43.097
Coming right up.

20:43.132 --> 20:44.331
Oh, my God.

20:44.367 --> 20:45.733
This is turning into a great day.

20:45.768 --> 20:47.701
We're gonna make a killing. (Laughs)

20:47.737 --> 20:49.904
Jimmy, these Porta
Pottis are the best thing

20:49.939 --> 20:52.006
that's ever happened to us!

20:52.041 --> 20:53.274
You know what these
Porta Pottis smell like?

20:53.309 --> 20:54.942
Success! (Sniffs, coughs) Oh, my God.
