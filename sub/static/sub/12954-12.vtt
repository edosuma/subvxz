WEBVTT

00:00.782 --> 00:02.770
I mean, there's a stream to the Russian S.V.R.,

00:02.818 --> 00:05.109
a European pharmaceutical conglomerate, the C.D.C.

00:05.755 --> 00:06.807
They are government.

00:06.814 --> 00:10.791
Marshall counted 12 sources that make up Prophet Five. 12, dad.

00:11.317 --> 00:12.367
My daughter...

00:13.522 --> 00:15.137
when will she be cured?

00:15.327 --> 00:16.190
Soon.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.878
Perhaps you could be a bit more specific.

00:17.879 --> 00:18.890
I wish I could...

00:19.265 --> 00:21.885
But there are a few more things we need you to do first.

00:22.286 --> 00:23.523
Sydnaey...

00:24.230 --> 00:25.686
You have a baby girl.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.128 --> 00:53.338
I'd apologize for the method of transport,

00:53.754 --> 00:55.942
but I'm sure you understand our need for discretion.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.618
And I am not in a position to simply disappear

00:59.693 --> 01:02.914
for an extended period of time without raising concern.

01:03.816 --> 01:06.289
Some advance warning would have been preferred.

01:06.443 --> 01:07.343
Yes...

01:07.693 --> 01:09.932
but then that would spoil all the fun.

01:18.130 --> 01:21.393
We have some business which requires your immediate attention.

01:21.505 --> 01:23.877
But I can assure you, we'll have you back in Los Angeles

01:23.878 --> 01:26.962
before your co-workers even realize that you've gone.

01:27.110 --> 01:29.770
It's not your timetable that troubles me, Joseph.

01:30.128 --> 01:31.075
It's your manners.

01:32.755 --> 01:33.655
Here you are.

01:37.129 --> 01:38.286
You're not joining us?

01:38.317 --> 01:40.106
The 12 are waiting for you inside.

01:41.695 --> 01:43.852
You're not allowed in that room, are you?

02:12.681 --> 02:14.042
Mr. Sloane.

02:14.381 --> 02:15.749
It's an honor to meet you.

02:16.256 --> 02:18.834
We've been admirers of yours for quite some time.

02:19.256 --> 02:20.156
Gentlemen.

02:21.382 --> 02:25.329
We'd like to thank you for all the work you've done thus far on our behalf.

02:25.942 --> 02:27.753
I'm not certain I have much choice.

02:27.754 --> 02:31.460
Not to get into a free will debate right now, Mr. Sloane, but...

02:32.146 --> 02:34.258
you've always had a choice.

02:34.940 --> 02:38.968
This is our most recent medical report on your daughter, Nadia.

02:39.501 --> 02:41.909
As you're aware, we have the capabilities

02:41.910 --> 02:43.228
to restore her health.

02:43.319 --> 02:45.783
And we're prepared to do so on a permanent basis,

02:45.830 --> 02:49.756
provided of course you complete one final assignment for us.

02:50.067 --> 02:53.754
No, I've heard such promises for some time now.

02:55.074 --> 02:56.685
Tell me, what guarantees do I have

02:56.686 --> 02:58.818
that this is the last you'll require of me?

02:58.819 --> 03:00.029
Look around you, Arvin.

03:01.068 --> 03:02.267
Would we show you our faces

03:02.268 --> 03:04.531
if it were our intention to keep you subservient?

03:05.692 --> 03:08.218
You've earned the right to stand in front of us.

03:09.195 --> 03:10.352
We have a job for you.

03:11.443 --> 03:14.390
You'll keep your eye on the endgame, as you always have.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.384
Because the moment this assignment is over,

03:17.568 --> 03:19.357
we'll give you back your daughter.

03:25.193 --> 03:26.982
What exactly do you want me to do?

03:29.932 --> 03:32.258
This prisoner is one of the most dangerous inmates

03:32.259 --> 03:33.444
we have in this facility.

03:33.445 --> 03:35.392
We don't leave anyone alone with her.

03:35.692 --> 03:37.639
I'm simply concerned for your safety.

03:37.943 --> 03:39.143
Well, that's sweet, but

03:39.882 --> 03:42.776
something tells me we're gonna get along just fine.

03:56.132 --> 03:58.720
Ms. Espinosa, my name's Kelly Peyton.

03:59.195 --> 04:03.247
I work for an independent organization interested in retaining your services.

04:03.630 --> 04:04.919
Get out of my cell.

04:05.382 --> 04:07.028
If I'm interrupting your busy schedule

04:07.085 --> 04:09.733
of invasive interrogation, I do apologize.

04:10.506 --> 04:13.611
This facility you're in doesn't exist on government record.

04:14.509 --> 04:18.456
You're being held here without charge, which means you don't exist anymore.

04:19.071 --> 04:21.596
I can't imagine that thought's appealing to you.

04:23.068 --> 04:25.224
My employer will secure your immediate release,

04:25.225 --> 04:26.257
in exchange for which,

04:26.322 --> 04:29.405
you will undertake a long-term, deep-cover operation for us.

04:29.507 --> 04:32.109
I told you to get out of my cell...

04:34.470 --> 04:38.273
which means if you don't take your skinny little ass

04:38.508 --> 04:40.359
back down that hallway right now...

04:41.730 --> 04:44.124
you won't exist anymore either.

04:44.223 --> 04:46.150
I don't think you're understanding me.

04:46.195 --> 04:49.931
I'm offering you the chance to get back at the person who put you here.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.599
I'm offering you the chance to destroy Sydney Bristow.

05:01.132 --> 05:02.032
Here you go.

05:15.451 --> 05:16.197
What are you doing?

05:16.198 --> 05:17.916
They fell when I tried to put them away.

05:17.923 --> 05:20.851
Sydney, you do not leave edged weapons within the reach of children.

05:20.860 --> 05:22.076
She's 4 weeks old, dad.

05:22.077 --> 05:23.505
Particularly young Bristow women.

05:23.506 --> 05:26.007
She can't even hold her head up. I think we're safe.

05:28.196 --> 05:29.756
Have you contacted your field sources?

05:29.757 --> 05:32.914
Nobody's heard so much as a whisper since Irina disappeared.

05:33.655 --> 05:35.683
We should task Echelon with her known aliases.

05:35.740 --> 05:36.679
We already have.

05:36.773 --> 05:39.291
Rest assured, we've engaged our full resources

05:39.292 --> 05:40.791
in looking for your mother.

05:41.396 --> 05:42.521
Any news of Prophet Five?

05:42.596 --> 05:44.794
No significant activity in the last few weeks.

05:47.021 --> 05:47.921
I don't like it.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.312
Mom dealt Prophet Five a significant blow

05:50.313 --> 05:51.466
when she stole the Horizon.

05:51.523 --> 05:53.117
If we aren't picking up activity,

05:53.887 --> 05:55.435
it's only because they're regrouping,

05:55.436 --> 05:57.318
coming up with an alternate plan of attack.

05:58.811 --> 06:00.914
Try to enjoy your time away.

06:01.895 --> 06:05.263
Right now you only need to concern yourself with being a mother.

06:05.897 --> 06:07.716
As soon as the affairs of the world

06:07.717 --> 06:10.002
require your attention, I'll let you know.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.333
I need assurances that Sydney Bristow will not be harmed.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.018
It's not our intention to kill miss Bristow,

06:22.019 --> 06:23.545
if that's what you're asking.

06:24.270 --> 06:27.427
I believe you're overestimating my ability to influence her.

06:28.645 --> 06:31.867
Even when agent Bristow thought that I was an honorable man,

06:32.375 --> 06:33.811
she rarely did as I directed.

06:34.023 --> 06:37.694
We're simply asking you to guide her actions a bit.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.130
She's on leave,

06:39.273 --> 06:42.325
content to stay at home and care for her newborn daughter.

06:43.207 --> 06:47.648
I can't task her to re-enter the field and expect her to follow orders.

06:50.022 --> 06:50.879
She would need...

06:50.880 --> 06:52.206
Incentive.

06:52.744 --> 06:55.078
I think you'll find, Arvin, it won't be as difficult

06:55.134 --> 06:57.652
to get miss Bristow into the field as you imagine.

07:20.521 --> 07:21.421
Will Tippin?

07:23.396 --> 07:25.083
Sorry, I think you have the wrong house.

07:25.084 --> 07:27.391
I'm agent Reeves, witness security, C.I.A.

07:27.895 --> 07:29.210
There's been an incident.

07:29.398 --> 07:32.187
I'm afraid that your cover may have been compromised.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.635
Something's happened to Sydney Bristow.

07:37.272 --> 07:38.172
Come in.

07:50.334 --> 07:52.207
Sir, is there anyone else in the house?

07:52.208 --> 07:53.648
I was sort of expecting someone.

07:53.649 --> 07:55.008
But you're alone now?

08:04.897 --> 08:07.115
All right. I've got him.

08:39.431 --> 08:41.440
Will's home security system caught the abduction.

08:41.506 --> 08:42.340
When did this happen?

08:42.341 --> 08:43.433
Last night.

08:43.434 --> 08:44.931
Will missed his standard check-in.

08:44.998 --> 08:46.857
Have we IDed the assailants?

08:50.952 --> 08:52.462
The detention facility reported

08:52.463 --> 08:54.995
Anna was still in custody as of yesterday morning.

08:54.996 --> 08:57.119
They were surprised too, to learn she's at large.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.453
And we're just going to accept that?

08:58.454 --> 08:59.638
No, of course not.

08:59.879 --> 09:02.232
Anna's escape, plus her knowledge of Will's location,

09:02.298 --> 09:04.747
suggests internal assistance at the highest level.

09:04.748 --> 09:06.560
Langley launched a full-scale investigation.

09:06.561 --> 09:07.994
I don't trust anyone else on this.

09:07.995 --> 09:09.807
We've already requested and been granted

09:09.808 --> 09:11.845
the authority to go after Tippin ourselves.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.496
We're only telling you this because Will is your friend,

09:14.497 --> 09:16.528
and we both know you'd want to be informed.

09:16.610 --> 09:18.626
We are not asking you to end your leave.

09:18.627 --> 09:20.045
We have this under control.

09:20.057 --> 09:21.803
You don't need to come back to work.

09:21.807 --> 09:24.343
Anna's involvement is actually a positive for us.

09:24.484 --> 09:26.933
She's too well-known in the underworld to disappear outright.

09:26.934 --> 09:27.454
We anticipate

09:27.455 --> 09:29.176
that she will reveal herself before long.

09:30.397 --> 09:31.505
We will find her.

09:31.748 --> 09:32.743
Yes, we will.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.256
I appreciate your effort to protect me on this,

09:43.998 --> 09:45.115
but as of this moment,

09:46.430 --> 09:47.284
I'm back.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.531
Would you mind holding his head steady, please?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.501
He should be awake shortly.

10:26.768 --> 10:28.294
I'll have Anna make the call.

10:29.627 --> 10:31.617
<i>I have the subject you requested.</i>

10:32.144 --> 10:34.706
<i>I'll give you the location once I receive payment.</i>

10:34.707 --> 10:35.607
<i>The Centurion.</i>

10:36.330 --> 10:38.319
<i>Midnight. Come alone.</i>

10:38.643 --> 10:41.081
Echelon intercepted the phone call an hour ago.

10:41.082 --> 10:42.502
Voiceprint matches.

10:42.954 --> 10:43.854
It's Anna.

10:43.955 --> 10:45.007
<i>Who's the other man?</i>

10:45.642 --> 10:47.658
We believe he's a Russian mafia lieutenant

10:47.659 --> 10:48.642
named Yerik Semanko.

10:48.643 --> 10:50.906
<i>The Centurion is one of their known fronts.</i>

10:51.705 --> 10:54.810
<i>Sydney, you're to infiltrate the club and surveil the meet.</i>

10:55.182 --> 10:57.851
<i>We'll have a support team on standby to extricate Will</i>

10:57.852 --> 10:59.829
<i>as soon as you ascertain his location.</i>

10:59.830 --> 11:01.019
<i>Anna will have 'em on alert.</i>

11:01.020 --> 11:03.831
It's doubtful we'll be able to just walk in the front door.

11:03.832 --> 11:06.568
We will have an insertion scenario prepared for you.

11:06.656 --> 11:09.315
You'll get the necessary op-tech as soon as you get on the plane.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.106
<i>Got it.</i>

11:11.591 --> 11:13.545
I gotta go. The baby-sitters are here.

11:14.892 --> 11:17.052
Miss Bristow? I'm agent Rance.

11:17.456 --> 11:18.561
This is agent Dalton.

11:18.644 --> 11:19.696
Your father sent us.

11:19.707 --> 11:21.233
He speaks very highly of you.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.017
May we come in?

11:22.018 --> 11:22.833
Sure.

11:27.385 --> 11:28.580
We've been briefed.

11:28.645 --> 11:30.268
You're wheels-up in 82 minutes.

11:30.269 --> 11:31.826
That doesn't give us much time.

11:35.578 --> 11:37.821
This has all been rather unexpected.

11:37.889 --> 11:40.951
It's my understanding Isabelle is approaching 5 weeks in age?

11:41.442 --> 11:43.128
I would imagine you have a healthy amount

11:43.129 --> 11:45.255
of separation anxiety towards leaving your daughter.

11:45.339 --> 11:46.964
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

11:47.015 --> 11:49.762
In addition to our field officer training, agent Dalton and I

11:49.763 --> 11:52.000
are both fully trained in infant development,

11:52.001 --> 11:53.265
including emergency care.

11:53.489 --> 11:55.514
If you agree, we'd like to go through the house,

11:55.515 --> 11:58.957
babyproof it from top to bottom, socket protectors, safety latches,

11:59.004 --> 12:02.731
gates for the stairs, spread-spectrum R.F. Detectors, perimeter sensors,

12:02.778 --> 12:05.226
explosive sniffers, all the usual stuff.

12:08.016 --> 12:11.226
Perhaps now would be a good time to introduce me to Isabelle.

12:15.328 --> 12:17.203
Sometimes she just likes to cry.

12:23.703 --> 12:27.120
It can take her a while to calm down. You just have to be patient.

12:27.327 --> 12:28.227
May I?

12:37.695 --> 12:40.699
I understand your current assignment is short-term?

12:40.954 --> 12:43.766
Yeah, I mean, hopefully she won't even know I've been gone.

12:43.767 --> 12:47.060
Oh, no. The mother-child bond is impossible to replicate,

12:47.061 --> 12:48.933
even by agent Dalton and myself.

12:49.952 --> 12:51.636
She'll definitely know you're gone.

12:51.763 --> 12:54.549
But we'll keep Isabelle safe and secure until you return.

12:54.952 --> 12:56.162
Thank you, agent Rance.

12:56.828 --> 12:58.249
No need to thank me, ma'am.

12:58.705 --> 13:00.810
I'll give you some time to say good-bye.

13:11.265 --> 13:13.337
It won't always be like this. I promise.

13:14.577 --> 13:18.172
I'm just trying to make the world safer so you can

13:18.567 --> 13:20.370
grow up and have a regular life.

13:23.182 --> 13:25.144
Someone I love is in trouble.

13:27.703 --> 13:29.281
I have to go and help him out.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.542
It's my job.

13:35.263 --> 13:36.775
Mama's gotta go to work.

14:02.392 --> 14:03.979
This is Phoenix. I'm in position.

14:03.994 --> 14:04.852
Copy that, Phoenix.

14:05.390 --> 14:08.528
Anna's supposed to meet Semanko in 53 minutes.

14:08.562 --> 14:09.123
Perfect.

14:09.188 --> 14:12.031
That should give us plenty of time to I.D. him, wire him for sound.

14:12.336 --> 14:13.801
Sidewinder, what's your status?

14:13.836 --> 14:15.661
Security's pretty tight down here, Phoenix.

14:15.678 --> 14:16.760
Looks like "A" list only.

14:17.733 --> 14:18.360
I'm on it.

14:43.401 --> 14:44.821
Marshall, I'm on the roof.

14:44.877 --> 14:45.714
All right.

14:45.955 --> 14:47.197
<i>Let me know when you're ready.</i>

14:54.472 --> 14:55.452
Relay's in place.

14:55.648 --> 14:58.377
OK. I'm accessing the network now to get the others into the club.

14:58.691 --> 14:59.688

15:00.308 --> 15:01.136
One...

15:03.141 --> 15:04.012
Okay, gang.

15:04.241 --> 15:05.199
You're on the list.

15:20.463 --> 15:21.857
Got a guard up top, Outrigger.

15:21.892 --> 15:23.139
I might need a bit of a distraction.

15:23.140 --> 15:24.170
Copy that.

15:24.384 --> 15:25.691
I'll see what I can do.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.392
All clear, Outrigger. Thank you.

16:07.821 --> 16:08.393
I'm in.

16:08.394 --> 16:09.269
Copy.

16:16.786 --> 16:17.581
Alright.

16:18.191 --> 16:19.226
Let's find our boy.

16:22.205 --> 16:24.419
Okay, Millimeter Wave is online. Here we go.

16:26.664 --> 16:28.170
<i>Marshall, I'm in position.</i>

16:28.842 --> 16:29.697
Got it.

16:35.818 --> 16:37.316
Sydney? Online.

16:37.384 --> 16:38.133
Here we go.

16:39.051 --> 16:41.417
All right, guys, Semanko's making a big payment, so...

16:42.037 --> 16:44.379
<i>We're looking for someone who's carrying a lot of cash.</i>

16:56.184 --> 16:57.750
Okay, Phoenix, I just take a look.

16:57.858 --> 16:59.119
This guy looks like he's got

16:59.135 --> 17:01.032
<i>a couple hundred dollars worth of rubles on him.</i>

17:01.051 --> 17:02.672
Definitely not Semanko.

17:02.673 --> 17:03.402
<i>Moving on.</i>

17:20.686 --> 17:23.182
We got dollars. We got euros,

17:23.194 --> 17:24.636
We've even got a little Turkish

17:24.656 --> 17:25.977
<i>Lira thrown in there but</i>

17:26.021 --> 17:28.879
doesn't look like anybody's buying more than a couple drinks tonight.

17:31.450 --> 17:32.420
Wait, hold on, Oracle.

17:32.471 --> 17:35.206
That guy who just passed you has a loaded Makarov under his jacket.

17:38.172 --> 17:38.972
Scratch that.

17:39.005 --> 17:40.580
We've got three guys with Makarovs.

17:40.636 --> 17:41.445
<i>Three guys.</i>

17:41.521 --> 17:42.545
<i>And the guy in the center</i>

17:42.553 --> 17:45.510
looks like he's got about $100,000 cold around his waist.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.536
Think we found comrade Semanko.

17:47.638 --> 17:49.136
Sidewinder, do you have a 20 on him?

17:49.502 --> 17:50.472
Northeast corner,

17:50.509 --> 17:51.947
<i>near the V.I.P. Section.</i>

17:52.530 --> 17:53.841
Got it. I'm on my way.

17:54.188 --> 17:55.475
<i>Oracle? Keep him busy.</i>

18:00.066 --> 18:01.649
Please, watch where you're going.

18:01.734 --> 18:02.636
I'm sorry.

18:02.874 --> 18:04.321
You have my apologies.

18:04.423 --> 18:05.172
Then...

18:05.308 --> 18:07.810
a true gentleman would offer to make it up to me.

18:07.844 --> 18:09.656
What exactly do you have in mind?

18:09.711 --> 18:10.478
Saskia.

18:16.344 --> 18:18.685
My apologies. My wife she's...

18:18.754 --> 18:20.115
a bit of a whore.

18:23.286 --> 18:24.341
Tracker's hot.

18:24.443 --> 18:25.362
<i>Copy that.</i>

18:25.472 --> 18:26.134
Merlin?

18:26.183 --> 18:27.745
<i>He just headed into the V.I.P room.</i>

18:28.048 --> 18:29.091
Check support teams.

18:29.154 --> 18:31.537
I want 'em ready to move as soon as we know Will's location.

18:31.630 --> 18:33.008
Copy that. They're on standby.

18:33.145 --> 18:35.408
<i>Ms. Espinosa. A pleasure.</i>

18:35.833 --> 18:36.647
Where's my payment?

18:36.648 --> 18:38.231
It's all here.

18:39.509 --> 18:40.922
Count it if you wish.

18:41.263 --> 18:42.225
Where is Tippin?

18:42.450 --> 18:43.761
Thought I'd make your life easy.

18:43.879 --> 18:45.514
You'll find him in room 147.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.253
Sidewinder, Oracle, do you copy? Will's in the building.

18:50.431 --> 18:52.040
Copy that. Right behind you.

18:59.970 --> 19:01.349
Would you two come with us, please.

19:10.196 --> 19:11.252
Are you okay?

19:16.077 --> 19:17.797
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

19:20.682 --> 19:22.231
How good is your operative?

19:22.758 --> 19:24.494
We'll find out soon enough.

19:30.857 --> 19:31.725
She hit her.

19:31.810 --> 19:33.308
Begin data capture.

20:06.261 --> 20:07.112
You okay?

20:07.793 --> 20:09.260
Where'd you learn to do that?

20:09.402 --> 20:12.006
Oh, I've just been taking some Krav Maga classes, you know.

20:14.108 --> 20:15.845
Maybe we'll do this again sometime.

20:21.325 --> 20:22.905
Do we need to send backup?

20:23.385 --> 20:24.789
No, let them go.

20:25.129 --> 20:27.236
We have exactly what we need.

20:33.349 --> 20:34.853
Well, so, did they interrogate you?

20:35.306 --> 20:37.995
When I came to, there were a bunch of people in the room but

20:38.956 --> 20:41.689
they didn't say a word to me. They just sort of left me alone.

20:42.224 --> 20:44.080
Next thing I know, you're kicking in the door.

20:45.843 --> 20:47.173
She got you good.

20:47.472 --> 20:48.636
Oh, it's cosmetic.

20:49.339 --> 20:50.173
It'll heal.

20:50.310 --> 20:52.403
Listen, you think it's safe to make a call?

20:52.590 --> 20:54.667
I should probably let my fiancée know I'm okay.

20:55.049 --> 20:56.377
Did you just say "fiancée"?

20:56.556 --> 20:57.373
Did I?

21:00.487 --> 21:01.713
Oh. I guess I did.

21:01.734 --> 21:02.553
Will!

21:02.607 --> 21:03.833
Do you remember that painter

21:04.473 --> 21:05.740
that I was gonna ask out?

21:05.860 --> 21:06.457
Yeah.

21:06.458 --> 21:07.834
I... I asked her out.

21:07.919 --> 21:09.357
And what, you're getting married?

21:09.386 --> 21:11.197
Yeah. Well, no, not exactly.

21:11.380 --> 21:14.042
I was actually planning on asking her last night

21:14.308 --> 21:16.786
before Anna interrupted.

21:16.957 --> 21:18.829
But I'm pretty sure she's gonna say yes.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.489
Oh, I can't believe this.

21:21.117 --> 21:23.531
How can you be marrying a girl I haven't even met yet?

21:24.103 --> 21:25.361
Well, you know,

21:25.521 --> 21:27.364
I think the government-mandated isolation

21:27.365 --> 21:28.943
might have something to do with it.

21:30.592 --> 21:32.533
Sydney, we haven't spoken in, like, two years.

21:32.852 --> 21:34.634
What about you? What's been going on?

21:37.959 --> 21:40.314
For starters, I have a daughter.

21:41.336 --> 21:41.946
What?

21:41.947 --> 21:43.975
Yeah, a baby girl.

21:44.466 --> 21:46.333
Her name is Isabelle.

21:48.642 --> 21:51.808
Sydney, are you kidding? That's incredible.

21:52.552 --> 21:53.834
Who's the father?

21:55.510 --> 21:56.425
Vaughn.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.412
Vaughn, of course.

22:00.711 --> 22:02.772
You guys finally ended up together.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.264
<i>I hate lying to him.</i>

22:07.808 --> 22:10.208
He's my best friend. I can't even tell him the truth.

22:11.893 --> 22:14.400
You should've seen Will's face when I told him Vaughn was dead.

22:14.601 --> 22:15.520
Sydney,

22:15.929 --> 22:19.474
the only way to ensure Vaughn's safety is to keep his existence a secret.

22:19.521 --> 22:20.715
You did the right thing.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.311
That doesn't make it any easier.

22:22.312 --> 22:25.834
Will's abduction only underscores our need for absolute vigilance.

22:26.073 --> 22:27.979
We're dealing with a very powerful opponent.

22:28.490 --> 22:30.166
You think Prophet Five had something to do

22:30.167 --> 22:31.062
with Will's abduction?

22:31.130 --> 22:33.955
There's no logical reason anyone would abduct Will Tippin...

22:34.746 --> 22:36.380
unless they were trying to get to you.

22:46.207 --> 22:48.897
Relax. The operation is moving forward as planned,

22:48.914 --> 22:51.382
and may I say that you have performed admirably.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.271
The agreement was for Nadia's cure.

22:53.662 --> 22:56.913
Yes, once the operation is complete.

22:57.496 --> 22:59.819
If I'm to prepare for any unforeseen circumstances,

22:59.854 --> 23:02.459
I need to know the full parameter of what you've planned.

23:02.564 --> 23:04.228
All you need to do, Arvin,

23:04.703 --> 23:08.433
is task your team accordingly when I give you the signal.

23:08.770 --> 23:10.370
And what exactly is the signal?

23:10.983 --> 23:11.842
Believe me,

23:12.055 --> 23:12.864
you'll know.

23:26.562 --> 23:28.451
This is Isabelle.

23:28.536 --> 23:29.718
Oh, Syd.

23:31.144 --> 23:32.291
Sydney, she's beautiful.

23:32.326 --> 23:35.482
Thank you.

23:35.483 --> 23:38.036
Ma'am, would you like us to stay on duty for the night?

23:38.070 --> 23:39.500
That won't be necessary.

23:39.908 --> 23:40.834
You can go home.

23:40.835 --> 23:41.609
Thank you.

23:41.610 --> 23:42.938
The surveillance equipment's up.

23:42.979 --> 23:43.755
Thank you.

23:43.886 --> 23:44.652
See you.

23:45.316 --> 23:45.978
You want to hold her?

23:45.979 --> 23:47.075
Really? Okay.

23:49.585 --> 23:50.415
Hey!

23:52.613 --> 23:53.430
Hey.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.519
I'm Will.

23:54.843 --> 23:56.278
What am I, like an uncle?

23:56.391 --> 23:57.073
Uncle.

23:57.074 --> 23:57.795
Yeah.

23:57.796 --> 23:59.089
I'm uncle Will.

24:01.198 --> 24:03.390
Will, we were talking about what happened.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.986
We have to assume you were grabbed

24:06.305 --> 24:08.135
because someone was trying to hurt me.

24:08.666 --> 24:09.730
Yeah? Well, yeah.

24:09.853 --> 24:13.043
I didn't think they wanted me for all the Lakers statistics I have in my head.

24:13.138 --> 24:14.126
Right? No.

24:15.748 --> 24:17.237
It's... just...

24:18.767 --> 24:20.336
I'm sorry.

24:20.762 --> 24:23.129
None of this would have happened if I wasn't in your life.

24:23.448 --> 24:25.523
Syd, stop. Are you kidding me right now?

24:25.709 --> 24:27.890
My life is so much better because you're in it.

24:36.215 --> 24:37.758
Oh, what... Oh.

24:40.266 --> 24:41.070
What...

24:41.967 --> 24:43.268
Sir? Hand over the baby.

24:43.269 --> 24:43.725
What?

24:43.726 --> 24:44.415
Agent Rance...

24:44.416 --> 24:44.838
Ma'am,

24:44.839 --> 24:46.506
take the baby from him right now.

24:46.507 --> 24:47.526
Okay, okay.

24:49.090 --> 24:49.774
What's going on?

24:50.936 --> 24:51.618
Take it easy.

24:51.653 --> 24:54.417
What's going on? Hey!

24:54.418 --> 24:55.604
Sydney, what's going on?

24:55.686 --> 24:57.098
I don't know. I don't know.

25:02.475 --> 25:07.040
Well, it's a sub dermal device placed just below the skull at the brain stem.

25:07.381 --> 25:09.357
I've never seen one this small before.

25:09.903 --> 25:12.354
It looks like they patched a radio receiver

25:12.453 --> 25:14.148
to a powerful microcharge.

25:16.947 --> 25:18.436
So, what? What does that mean?

25:18.733 --> 25:20.494
It means that they... they...

25:21.086 --> 25:22.580
put a bomb in your head.

25:22.581 --> 25:23.357
What?

25:23.358 --> 25:26.109
I know. I know. But there's good news.

25:26.241 --> 25:29.385
It looks like the charge is small enough that the blast will be localized.

25:30.838 --> 25:31.612
Wait, wait.

25:31.694 --> 25:32.418
So it might not kill me.

25:32.419 --> 25:34.245
Oh, no. It'll definitely kill you.

25:34.246 --> 25:35.925
There just won't be any collateral damage.

25:36.007 --> 25:36.804
Marshall...

25:37.010 --> 25:38.266
How do we get it out of him?

25:38.535 --> 25:41.218
Well, we could perform a surgical procedure, but...

25:41.729 --> 25:43.857
I'm worried there's a gyroscopic fail-safe.

25:44.102 --> 25:46.884
I mean, there is a very real chance that if we try to remove it,

25:48.120 --> 25:50.057
Will's head could explode.

25:50.183 --> 25:52.367
Get medical in here. I want a full extraction scenario.

25:52.381 --> 25:54.894
What? No! Didn't you just hear what he said about the exploding?

25:54.905 --> 25:55.595
Will, calm down.

25:55.604 --> 25:57.770
Sydney, how can I calm down? There's a bomb in my head.

25:57.776 --> 25:58.850
Look, don't worry about it.

25:58.854 --> 26:00.390
We're gonna get it out of you. Just...

26:00.409 --> 26:01.310
What is that?

26:06.475 --> 26:07.430
It's my phone.

26:07.859 --> 26:09.306
It's just my phone.

26:12.746 --> 26:13.968
Am I supposed to answer this?

26:17.440 --> 26:18.212
Hello?

26:18.443 --> 26:19.579
<i>Hello, Sydney.</i>

26:20.221 --> 26:23.431
Now that I have your attention, I have some demands.

26:26.347 --> 26:27.620
<i>Pay attention, Syd.</i>

26:29.910 --> 26:32.968
<i>You are going to need to do exactly as you are told.</i>

26:33.319 --> 26:35.488
<i>You have access to the government's</i>

26:35.639 --> 26:37.353
<i>Rambaldi archives at the D.S.R.</i>

26:37.582 --> 26:41.287
I'd like you to bring me a particular page from his manuscript.

26:41.444 --> 26:42.444
Which one?

26:43.690 --> 26:44.690
Page 47.

26:45.343 --> 26:47.284
<i>I'm sure you're familiar with it.</i>

26:48.554 --> 26:50.357
There's a train leaving for Madrid

26:50.381 --> 26:53.249
from the Coimbra rail station at 2100 tomorrow.

26:53.752 --> 26:55.214
<i>Be on it. Come alone.</i>

26:55.564 --> 26:58.218
<i>Once I have the manuscript page in my possession,</i>

26:58.300 --> 27:01.036
I will give you the deactivation codes for the bomb.

27:01.125 --> 27:05.575
<i>- Anna, I swear to you... - Any deviation, Sydney,</i>

27:05.885 --> 27:08.708
and I'm afraid I'll have to blow up your friend.

27:08.735 --> 27:09.735
<i>Bye now.</i>

27:11.819 --> 27:13.294
We have to take her threat seriously.

27:13.295 --> 27:16.044
Marcus, how quickly can you get page 47 from the D.S.R.?

27:16.045 --> 27:17.645
I can have it within the hour.

27:17.646 --> 27:18.551
Do it.

27:18.552 --> 27:20.316
Of all the Rambaldi artifacts,

27:20.557 --> 27:22.145
why would she want page 47?

27:25.414 --> 27:26.503
Who's Rambaldi?

27:26.738 --> 27:29.720
Milo Rambaldi was a 15th century visionary

27:29.767 --> 27:32.622
with an uncanny ability to predict the future.

27:32.726 --> 27:36.081
His designs have prophesied everything from binary code

27:36.139 --> 27:39.169
- to nuclear weaponry to... - is that Sydney?

27:39.676 --> 27:42.937
Not exactly. There are people that believe that's me.

27:44.586 --> 27:46.272
"Mulier hic picturata. "

27:46.886 --> 27:49.297
"The woman pictured here, the chosen one,"

27:49.686 --> 27:52.862
"will render the greatest power unto utter desolation. "

27:55.410 --> 27:57.008
You're "the chosen one"?

28:04.176 --> 28:06.450
You people really believe this stuff?

28:07.778 --> 28:11.110
We've... seen things that give Rambaldi's words weight.

28:11.191 --> 28:14.593
Guys, can we debate this later... after the bomb is out of my head?

28:14.594 --> 28:16.348
What's the harm in giving Anna the page?

28:16.383 --> 28:18.593
These are prophecies about things I might do.

28:18.594 --> 28:20.493
If I don't do them, they're just words.

28:20.494 --> 28:22.309
That's right, Sydney, you have a point.

28:22.310 --> 28:23.957
Without you, that page is worthless.

28:23.958 --> 28:26.714
We're not seriously considering giving into Anna's demands?

28:26.715 --> 28:27.663
Yes, we... yes, we are.

28:27.664 --> 28:28.646
No, we're not.

28:28.647 --> 28:30.774
This page will get me close, but there's no guarantee

28:30.775 --> 28:33.074
Anna will deactivate you if we give her what she wants.

28:33.075 --> 28:35.091
Marshall, can you hack the detonation frequency?

28:35.115 --> 28:37.921
Well, I mean, she mentioned deactivation codes.

28:38.065 --> 28:39.793
The bomb and the detonator are networked.

28:39.794 --> 28:42.143
I mean, maybe I could build a device that would tap

28:42.144 --> 28:45.207
into the communication protocol, reverse engineer the codes,

28:45.208 --> 28:47.214
but we would need to get the bomb

28:47.273 --> 28:50.289
within range of the detonator in order for it to initialize.

28:50.324 --> 28:51.322
Get started on it.

28:51.364 --> 28:53.344
But... the only thing I understood from that

28:53.379 --> 28:55.846
was to get the bomb in range of the detonator?

28:55.881 --> 28:57.360
You ever been to Portugal?

29:05.825 --> 29:06.928
I'm sorry.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.466
It's simply not possible.

29:10.295 --> 29:12.295
There has been a terrible mistake.

29:12.854 --> 29:13.854
Look at me.

29:14.584 --> 29:17.643
I would not know how to purchase a coach ticket if I tried.

29:17.678 --> 29:20.664
We demand a first-class cabin at the front of the car.

29:20.665 --> 29:23.390
It is away from the commoners.

29:23.409 --> 29:25.182
Please, there is nothing I can do.

29:25.229 --> 29:26.920
I simply will not allow my wife...

29:26.921 --> 29:30.515
my delicate, porcelain lily...

29:30.857 --> 29:33.194
to be ogled by the Portuguese wharfmongers.

29:37.877 --> 29:38.963
Does he speak Portuguese to us?

29:38.964 --> 29:40.018
I believe so.

29:40.053 --> 29:42.148
It is a dead language. It hurts my ears.

29:42.203 --> 29:45.490
Perhaps our fluent steward speaks euro.

29:53.026 --> 29:54.586
Careful. It's fragile.

29:56.291 --> 29:59.027
I hope you find this cabin to your liking.

30:01.459 --> 30:03.487
Perfectly adequate. Thank you.

30:06.311 --> 30:08.448
Will, "delicate porcelain lily"?

30:09.082 --> 30:11.054
Leave me alone. I was on a roll.

30:15.216 --> 30:17.976
Syd... you know, my girl,

30:18.030 --> 30:19.533
she's waiting for me back home,

30:19.595 --> 30:23.458
and, uh... so depending on how this all goes down...

30:25.591 --> 30:26.376
if, uh, I was...

30:26.377 --> 30:27.825
Will, look at me.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.591
You're gonna make it through this.

30:29.637 --> 30:31.516
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.240
- I know that. - Okay.

30:33.276 --> 30:34.967
Wait. What did you think I was asking?

30:35.002 --> 30:37.585
I... was just being supportive in case you thought...

30:38.157 --> 30:38.613
you might...

30:38.614 --> 30:39.477
Die?

30:39.478 --> 30:41.368
It's not important. What were you asking?

30:41.435 --> 30:43.493
I was asking you to be my best man.

30:44.646 --> 30:45.577
Really?

30:45.578 --> 30:46.747
Yeah.

30:46.782 --> 30:48.855
Before I realized that you have such little faith in me.

30:48.879 --> 30:50.199
You thought I was gonna die?

30:50.200 --> 30:52.494
No, I... you want me to be your best man?

30:52.729 --> 30:54.451
Well, I did. Now I'm not so sure.

30:54.498 --> 30:56.956
How would that work, exactly? Would I have to wear a tux?

30:56.979 --> 31:00.224
You don't have to worry about it, 'cause you're not invited.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.464
Okay, we're in.

31:06.541 --> 31:07.640
There she is.

31:07.979 --> 31:11.742
Now I just have to keep Anna busy long enough to scan the codes.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.036
Incidentally, I'd be honored.

31:16.828 --> 31:18.009
Let's do this.

31:32.336 --> 31:33.336
You're early.

31:33.606 --> 31:36.380
I've never been good at following the rules.

31:37.377 --> 31:40.546
I understand you being so cavalier about your own life,

31:40.585 --> 31:44.401
but I'm surprised that you care so little about your friend.

31:44.907 --> 31:45.912
<i>All right, Syd...</i>

31:48.570 --> 31:49.484
It's working.

31:49.520 --> 31:50.516
Tell me, Sydney,

31:50.988 --> 31:54.146
what's to keep me from killing Tippin right now?

31:57.665 --> 32:00.017
You've always been a professional, Anna.

32:01.879 --> 32:03.689
And I have something you want.

32:04.928 --> 32:05.928
Not here.

32:07.127 --> 32:09.127
Let's find someplace more private.

32:10.227 --> 32:11.812
Okay. So far, so good.

32:19.210 --> 32:20.525
Okay, you're at 38%.

32:20.616 --> 32:21.781
Stay close.

32:29.939 --> 32:32.064
Not a very flattering likeness.

32:32.506 --> 32:35.260
What I want to know is, why do you want it?

32:35.879 --> 32:37.744
We disproved these writings years ago.

32:37.745 --> 32:40.707
Doesn't really concern me as long as the check clears.

32:41.510 --> 32:45.447
Although I must say I have had a lot of fun on this one.

32:46.149 --> 32:47.665
Where is the detonator?

32:47.666 --> 32:48.960
I don't have it on me.

32:49.477 --> 32:50.517
Wait here.

32:50.562 --> 32:51.582
<i>No, she's lying, Syd.</i>

32:51.607 --> 32:54.989
We wouldn't be able to run the scanner if she didn't have the detonator on her.

32:55.612 --> 32:57.260
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

32:57.307 --> 33:00.915
Sydney, you know I don't play by the rules very well either.

33:01.126 --> 33:03.216
Wait here. I'm not asking.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.039
No, we're only at 65%.

33:05.100 --> 33:06.511
<i>You can't let her leave.</i>

33:19.411 --> 33:21.550
Sydney! Sydney, my head's beeping!

34:14.635 --> 34:16.344
You still having fun, Anna?

34:17.828 --> 34:19.206
You'll never beat me.

34:20.627 --> 34:22.978
And you still don't understand the game.

35:24.816 --> 35:26.836
We're collecting her D.N.A. Now.

35:26.871 --> 35:28.546
We have begun the process.

35:30.426 --> 35:33.189
You should have genetic samples shortly.

35:33.748 --> 35:36.639
I understand. There will be no further delays.

35:47.997 --> 35:49.061
Syd!

35:57.465 --> 35:59.204
It's okay. I've got you!

36:00.497 --> 36:02.241
Anna... we have to get her...

36:04.286 --> 36:05.590
I'm right here, Syd.

36:07.371 --> 36:09.463
Looks like you have about 30 seconds.

36:46.539 --> 36:47.878
Oh, thank god.

36:48.234 --> 36:49.854
I'm ready to go home.

37:07.746 --> 37:10.085
Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.

37:10.124 --> 37:11.829
How exactly was Bristow harm?

37:12.324 --> 37:16.618
You locked her in a train car, and you sprayed her with a chemical agent.

37:16.673 --> 37:20.055
I assume your doctors have given her a thorough examination.

37:20.472 --> 37:23.407
Let me guess... they couldn't find anything wrong.

37:23.443 --> 37:25.216
I need to know what you did to her.

37:25.270 --> 37:26.270
No, you don't.

37:26.821 --> 37:28.478
All you need to know, Mr. Sloane,

37:28.479 --> 37:31.630
is that you've fulfilled your contract with our organization.

37:31.777 --> 37:32.777
Congratulations.

37:33.821 --> 37:35.526
We've prepared the compound.

37:36.139 --> 37:38.011
Inside you'll find the necessary instructions

37:38.046 --> 37:40.526
for administering the cure to your daughter.

37:42.699 --> 37:43.699
It's all there...

37:44.248 --> 37:46.600
everything you need to bring Nadia back.

37:48.209 --> 37:50.856
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.

38:08.155 --> 38:11.513
We've loaded the Bristow D.N.A. Template into the sequencer.

38:11.609 --> 38:13.659
Genetic fluid is primed and ready.

38:15.208 --> 38:16.208
Good.

38:17.538 --> 38:18.725
How's our subject?

38:19.190 --> 38:20.965
Ready to get this over with.

38:21.685 --> 38:22.974
Vitals are good.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.839
The provacillium should be taking effect.

38:26.915 --> 38:29.488
I've given you something to help with the pain.

38:29.579 --> 38:33.873
If our prior experiences with genetic manipulation serve as an indicator,

38:35.238 --> 38:38.002
I'm afraid the narcotics won't be of much help.

38:38.335 --> 38:40.261
I'm sure I've been through worse.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.928
I really don't think you have.

39:08.744 --> 39:10.180
They'll give you a panic button.

39:10.204 --> 39:12.517
If anything happens, I'll be at your side in 30 seconds.

39:12.540 --> 39:13.974
Okay. That part sounds pretty cool.

39:13.975 --> 39:15.252
Yeah, we'll keep you safe.

39:15.253 --> 39:16.558
Syd, don't worry about me.

39:16.602 --> 39:17.777
I can't help it.

39:19.115 --> 39:21.181
I'm sorry you've had to go through all this, Will.

39:21.210 --> 39:23.727
If you apologize one more time, I'm gonna slap you.

39:23.774 --> 39:25.428
Hey, it's not your fault.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.459
It is, actually.

39:29.183 --> 39:30.435
The people I love...

39:30.533 --> 39:33.969
sooner or later, something terrible happens to them.

39:34.069 --> 39:36.069
It happens over and over and over.

39:36.732 --> 39:39.106
They're kidnapped, they're tortured...

39:40.165 --> 39:41.257
or killed...

39:42.339 --> 39:43.574
because they know me.

39:44.083 --> 39:46.046
I feel like I'm this plague,

39:46.200 --> 39:48.233
and everyone I love is infected.

39:51.369 --> 39:52.369
I just...

39:55.738 --> 39:58.988
I just want you to know how sorry I am for all of it.

39:59.775 --> 40:01.127
Yes, I've been tortured,

40:01.128 --> 40:04.010
and I've been kidnapped... several times, actually,

40:04.047 --> 40:05.010
and most likely,

40:05.033 --> 40:08.039
none of that would have happened if I hadn't helped a clumsy girl

40:08.040 --> 40:10.687
pick up her books freshman year in bio class.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.539
But it's not your fault.

40:14.917 --> 40:17.613
You can't blame yourself for the evils of the world.

40:17.648 --> 40:20.642
Look, since I've known you, I've seen a lot of horrible things.

40:20.670 --> 40:22.519
There are people out there that are capable

40:22.520 --> 40:26.108
of more cruelty and more hatred that I even thought possible.

40:26.189 --> 40:28.467
But I still sleep well at night. You know why?

40:28.503 --> 40:31.392
Because I know that you're out there fighting against them.

40:31.450 --> 40:33.705
Sydney, you save the world every day,

40:33.841 --> 40:36.252
and you never ask for anything in return.

40:37.989 --> 40:40.694
I think I speak for everybody who loves you...

40:41.872 --> 40:44.469
when I say thank you for watching over us.

40:47.368 --> 40:50.295
But if you'd never met me, you'd have a regular life.

40:50.370 --> 40:51.370
Who wants it?

40:53.347 --> 40:55.439
I wouldn't trade you for anything.

40:55.750 --> 40:58.791
I know a lot of regular people who live regular lives.

40:59.459 --> 41:01.396
There's only one Sydney Bristow.
