The alpha male wants everybody

52:04.389 --> 52:06.357
This isn't a walk.
We're running.

52:06.424 --> 52:08.659
Why do we always
have to run?

52:08.726 --> 52:12.163
* I got you now
and I just want to *

52:12.230 --> 52:14.932
* Show you how to play *

52:14.999 --> 52:17.968
* Goose bumps on your body *

52:18.035 --> 52:19.970
* Guide the way *

52:20.037 --> 52:21.939
* I wanna go all night *

52:22.006 --> 52:25.476
* Ain't no stoppin' till
the breakin' of the dawn *

52:25.543 --> 52:28.746
* I wanna go inside

52:28.813 --> 52:31.148
* 'Cause you really
turn me on *

52:31.216 --> 52:33.418
* I wanna go

52:33.484 --> 52:36.754

[ Lucky Narrating ]
Yep, there was love
in the air.

52:41.926 --> 52:45.663
Be the man.
Be the man.

52:45.730 --> 52:48.032
Be... the... man.

52:48.098 --> 52:50.601
Hey.
Now, you listen to me.

52:50.668 --> 52:53.304
Yeah, that's right.
You're in my house now.

52:53.371 --> 52:56.106
- Hmm?
- Yeah, my house.

52:56.173 --> 53:00.845
Also my house.
All of these are my house.

53:00.911 --> 53:03.848
Hey, you're a lucky girl,
you know that? Yeah.

53:03.914 --> 53:06.517
You're the lucky one,
not me. You.
[ Chuckles ]

53:06.584 --> 53:08.853
Hey. You want to go
out with me tonight?
Would that be good?

53:08.919 --> 53:11.356
Hey, wait a minute.
What do you think
you're doing?

53:11.422 --> 53:13.424
Who-Who-Who, me?
No. I'm not doing anything.

53:13.491 --> 53:16.527
I'm just, you know,
assuming the position.

53:18.028 --> 53:21.466
- Hey. You marked my tree.
- Oh, no.
I would never do that.

53:21.532 --> 53:23.434
I would never mark--
mark your tree.

53:23.501 --> 53:25.936
I don't even know
what those words mean.
I drank a lot of water.

53:26.003 --> 53:28.939
I'll tell you
something about water.
It goes right through me.

53:29.006 --> 53:30.841
Come on.
It smells like lemonade.

53:30.908 --> 53:34.645
Oh. Yeah.
Oh, I see your point.
Yeah, yours is...

53:34.712 --> 53:36.481
very, very strong.

53:36.547 --> 53:40.485
It's like-- like ammonia.
I'm actually getting dizzy,
to tell you the truth. Ha.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.820
Come on. Let's beat it.
We're leaving.

53:42.887 --> 53:44.755
[ Lucky ]
You two are going, huh?
Have fun.

53:44.822 --> 53:48.158
Have fun. You make
a very handsome couple.
[ Chuckles ]

53:48.225 --> 53:50.728
God, I hate myself.

53:50.795 --> 53:53.230
[ Buzzing ]

53:53.298 --> 53:58.202
[ Archie ] Wow.
[ Ava ] Yeah. Bears have died
trying to reach that hive.

53:58.269 --> 54:00.871
Well, if you want it,
you got it.

54:00.938 --> 54:03.674
Oh, please.
Don't even think about it.
That's not funny.

54:03.741 --> 54:06.444
- No. I'm gonna
go get it for you.
- Archie, I'm serious.

54:06.511 --> 54:08.979
Don't. It's too dangerous.
Promise me.
Okay.

54:09.046 --> 54:12.450
Okay. I like you, Ava.

54:12.517 --> 54:14.819
I like you too,

- Oh. What are you girls
doing over here?
- Sonny, don't.

54:19.123 --> 54:21.459
Beat it, circus boy.

54:21.526 --> 54:23.628
Sonny--
Oh, you keep your yap shut.

54:23.694 --> 54:26.564
[ Chuckles ]
Your charm is matched
only by your odor.

54:26.631 --> 54:29.934
- And what does that mean?
- That just means you're
a malodorous ignoramus.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.270
- It's nothing, really.
- What's he saying?
I'm confused.

54:33.338 --> 54:35.239
And I don't like
being confused.

54:35.306 --> 54:38.943
- Yeah, he really doesn't.
- Really? Well, you'd think
he'd get used to it, huh?

54:39.009 --> 54:41.512
Let's go, Ava.
Tryin' to confuse me.
[ Mumbling ]

54:41.579 --> 54:44.882
Ava, don't go.
Look, maybe you can do better
than me, but don't do worse.

54:44.949 --> 54:47.251
I thought you liked me.
Of course I do.

54:47.318 --> 54:49.954
[ Sonny ] Come on, Ava.
But you'll always
be a city bear.

54:50.020 --> 54:52.056
And I need more than that.

54:52.122 --> 54:56.361
City bear.
[ Sighs ]
Great.

55:01.832 --> 55:04.001
Should we, uh,
put all our cards
on the table?

55:04.068 --> 55:06.003
Of course.

55:07.738 --> 55:10.475
This bear you brought up here
has as much likelihood
of making...

55:10.541 --> 55:12.510
little bear babies
as Riley here.

55:12.577 --> 55:14.612
Ain't-a-gonna happen.

55:14.679 --> 55:16.647
But, on the other hand,
thanks to you,

55:16.714 --> 55:19.784
I'm not exactly drowning
in favorable publicity.

55:19.850 --> 55:24.021
So, here's my offer.
I will set aside ten acres,

55:24.088 --> 55:25.990
turn it into a sanctuary.

55:26.056 --> 55:28.626
You can bring
all your little
animal buddies there.

55:28.693 --> 55:30.828
Plus,
you'll be saving face.

55:30.895 --> 55:34.031
You won't have
to admit you failed.
You don't look like a fool.

55:35.232 --> 55:37.101
Look, ten acres is ridiculous.

55:37.167 --> 55:39.203
That's the offer.

55:39.269 --> 55:41.572
The deadline is Wednesday
at 12:00 noon.
Let me be clear.

55:41.639 --> 55:44.141
At 12:01,
we'll be sending in
every logger,

55:44.208 --> 55:46.744
every piece of logging
equipment we've got.

55:46.811 --> 55:49.547
By Friday, there won't
be a tree standing.

55:51.048 --> 55:54.351
[ Sighs ]
I need to run this
by my wife.

55:54.419 --> 55:57.422
Excellent idea.
There's a pay phone
in the back.

55:57.488 --> 55:59.690
Excuse me.

56:02.527 --> 56:06.731
Calling the wife.
Always a sign of weakness.

Whoo-hoo, woo, woo.
Hey, Johnny.

I'm allowed in here.

I'm just sorry
I dragged you into all this.

56:30.888 --> 56:33.223
I'm going to have
to get you an audition
in Vegas or something.

56:33.290 --> 56:35.860
These guys offered me a deal,
and it's the best I can do.

56:35.926 --> 56:38.729
No, no, no.
The best you can do
is not give up on me, Doc.

56:38.796 --> 56:41.966
Come on. You told me,
"Listen to your inner bear."
Remember?

56:42.032 --> 56:45.803
- I don't know, Archie.
- Look, I know how
I can win Ava.

56:45.870 --> 56:48.372
Okay. I know
I'm nuts or something.

56:48.439 --> 56:50.641

I'll give you one more chance.

56:50.708 --> 56:52.877

Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Uh-oh, what?
What's the problem?

56:55.680 --> 56:58.148
Ice cream is acting up.
What ice cream?

56:58.215 --> 57:01.185
I got depressed
after Sonny and Ava,
and I went on a bender.

57:01.251 --> 57:04.589
And by the second gallon,
I realized I'm in love
with Ava...

57:04.655 --> 57:07.958
and this ice cream
called "Cherry Garcia."

throw up on me.

Wait. You got to do that,

- I can't hold it!
- Wait! You got to lift
the lid up first.

This is not going to be
big enough! Oh, boy!

57:21.572 --> 57:24.074

Just sit there.
I'm gonna keep guard outside.

57:24.141 --> 57:26.944

Just take care of what
you got to take care.

in one second. I'm gonna
take care of business.

got to coax it down.

a little pep talk.

I gotta stay in here
with you.

57:41.191 --> 57:44.228

Please, don't do nothing
till I get the window open.

a little bit.

to be enough.

It's worse than I imagined.

[ Pepito ] Stop staring at me.
You're giving me a complex.

58:30.575 --> 58:33.243
I'm trying to blend.
Well, if you can hear me,

58:33.310 --> 58:36.046
can you change
to the color of this table--
What do you think you're doing?

58:36.113 --> 58:39.083
- I think he understands me.
- Well, if he understood me,

58:39.149 --> 58:41.719
I'd tell him how sick I am
of all these stupid animals.

[ Gasps ]
Oh, that really hurt.

58:43.754 --> 58:46.791
If you could understand me,
I'd tell you to do something
about those dandruff flakes.

Christmas in July.

I thought it wasn't
working with Archie.

he can win Ava over.

that's bothering you, isn't it?

I'm not saying
it's all your fault.
Maybe it's my fault.

59:28.833 --> 59:31.802
Maybe it's a phase
that you're going through.
But something's bothering you.

And your mother thinks that
you got a problem, and you're
not telling us about it.

right now! Come back in!

No way, Doc.

or die trying.

back in here right now.

I'm gonna win Ava
by eating a bunch of worms.

I'm never gonna be
more woodsy than Sonny.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:31.588
I have to show her
how much she means to me.

And if you fall,
it's gonna prove that
you're stupid and dead, Archie.

got a new trick.

- Okay, I got it.

gonna hold him.
