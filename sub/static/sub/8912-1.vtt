02:11.215 --> 02:13.299
Hilario.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.543
Papa!

03:26.498 --> 03:28.749
Sotero! My good friend.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.168
How are ya?

03:38.510 --> 03:40.803
You have a drink?

03:42.931 --> 03:46.559
I can't tell you what a pleasure
it is to see a village like this.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.568
Santos!

03:55.652 --> 03:58.613
So much restlessness and
change in the outside world.

03:58.697 --> 04:01.866
People no longer content
with their station in life.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.827
Women's fashions? Shameless.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.538
Cigar.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.624
Mire! Religion!

04:09.708 --> 04:13.878
You'd weep if you saw how true
religion is now a thing of the past.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.759
Last month we were in San Juan...
a rich town. Sit down.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.846
Rich town, much blessed by God.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.432
Big church.

04:26.516 --> 04:31.562
Not like here... little church,
priest comes twice a year. Big one!

04:31.647 --> 04:35.566
You think we find gold candlesticks,
poor box filled to overflowing?

04:35.651 --> 04:37.610
You know what we found?

04:37.694 --> 04:41.072
Brass candlesticks, almost
nothing in the poor box.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.033
But we took it anyway.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.244
I know we took it anyway.

04:47.329 --> 04:51.415
I'm trying to show him how little
religion some people now have.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.876
That I could see for myself.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.506
Don't see!

04:59.508 --> 05:01.759
What if you had
to carry my load?

05:01.843 --> 05:06.055
The need to provide food, like a father,
to fill the mouths of his hungry men.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.224
Guns. Ammunition.

05:09.601 --> 05:13.437
You know how much money
that costs?!

05:13.522 --> 05:15.147
No.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.483
The days of good
hunting are over.

05:17.567 --> 05:22.613
Once there was horses, cattle, gold,
fruit from the trees. No more.

05:23.865 --> 05:28.577
Now I must hunt with a price on
my head, rurales at my heels.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.835
I'll be back.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.172
Enough!

05:48.181 --> 05:50.891
We'll get the rest
when we come back.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.150
I love this village.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.902
I know you have
your problems...

06:01.987 --> 06:04.488
Murderer! Thief!

06:11.413 --> 06:13.497
Rafael!

06:13.874 --> 06:15.541
Rafael!

06:15.625 --> 06:16.917
Rafael...

06:17.002 --> 06:19.253
Rafael!

06:20.589 --> 06:22.673
Stupid!

06:24.176 --> 06:26.260
Stupid!

06:28.138 --> 06:31.223
We have to have another
discussion very soon.

06:31.308 --> 06:35.561
It's always a pleasure to hear the
views of my good friend Sotero.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.566
Maybe when I come back, hm?

06:40.650 --> 06:41.776
Â¡Adios!

06:41.860 --> 06:43.944
Let's go!

07:15.811 --> 07:17.895
Help me bring him in.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.586
If he steals
our harvest again...

07:42.671 --> 07:46.298
we might as well cut our
throats and be done with it!

07:47.425 --> 07:50.010
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.971
Live somewhere else?

07:52.055 --> 07:55.307
Take our homes
with us? Our farms?

07:55.433 --> 07:58.060
We... could hide some food.

07:58.979 --> 08:03.190
From Calvera? He never
steals all our food.

08:03.275 --> 08:06.402
He leaves us
enough to go on with.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.862
That's something.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.030
We could beg him
to leave us more.

08:10.115 --> 08:14.535
No, no. That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.454
We must do something!

08:17.539 --> 08:20.291
Like Rafael? Talk sense.

08:20.375 --> 08:24.044
We break our backs in the fields,
and our bellies stay empty.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.589
We must do something!

08:26.673 --> 08:27.965
We must do something.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.301
But what?

08:30.385 --> 08:32.469
I don't know.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.227
We'll ask the old man.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.565
He'll know.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.735
Fight.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.487
You must fight. Fight!

08:51.031 --> 08:54.742
With machetes and bare
hands against guns?!

08:54.826 --> 08:56.202
Buy guns.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.369
Buy?

08:57.454 --> 09:01.415
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.668
But what are we
going to use for money?

09:16.389 --> 09:18.307
Sell that.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.101
And anything else
you can collect.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.356
Even if we had the guns...

09:25.440 --> 09:30.277
we know how to plant and grow
We don't know how to kill.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.780
Then learn.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.949
Or die.

10:31.423 --> 10:34.341
Hey! I've been waitin' for you.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.262
Oh, you did a wonderful job.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.514
I'm sorry, but
there'll be no funeral.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.640
What?!

10:41.725 --> 10:46.145
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as
ready as the embalmer can make him...

10:46.229 --> 10:48.022
but there'll be no funeral.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.773
Didn't I pay you enough?

10:49.858 --> 10:54.653
It's not a question of money. For $20, I'd
plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.698
But the funeral's off.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.867
Well, how d'ya like that?!

10:59.951 --> 11:04.455
I want him buried. You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.457
That's as unanimous
as you can get.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.251
You've behaved
like a Christian, but...

11:09.336 --> 11:11.962
Now, look. I'm not
lookin' for any praise.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.465
I'm a traveling salesman...
ladies' corsets.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.217
I'm walking down the street
and a man drops dead.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.971
For two hours people stepped over
him, without lifting a finger.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.223
I'm doing what
any decent man would.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.391
Come on, Henry...

11:24.476 --> 11:26.143
No! This man has to be buried.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.354
Soon. He's not
turning into a nosegay.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.481
I know. I would
if I could, but...

11:30.607 --> 11:32.900
there's an element
in town that objects.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.194
Objects? To what?

11:35.278 --> 11:37.905
They say he isn't
fit to be buried there.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.573
What? In Boot Hill?

11:39.657 --> 11:43.285
There's nothing there but
murderers, cutthroats and barflies.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.330
And if they ever felt
exclusive, they're past it now.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.124
They happen to be
white, friend.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.293
And old Sam...

11:52.420 --> 11:54.963
Well, old Sam was an Indian.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.258
Well, I'll be damned!

11:58.343 --> 12:02.221
I never knew you had to be anything
but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.390
How long's this been going on?

12:04.474 --> 12:06.475
Since the town got civilized.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.186
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it. No, sir.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.648
I've always treated every man
as another future customer.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.400
In that case,
get that hearse rollin'.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.193
My driver's quit.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.611
He's prejudiced too?

12:17.695 --> 12:20.447
If it comes to gettin'
his head blown off.

12:20.532 --> 12:21.573
Well, get somebody else.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.243
Nobody else will drive it!
So here.

12:24.327 --> 12:28.622
Oh, hell! If that's all that's holding
things up, I'll drive the rig.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.259
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?

12:40.343 --> 12:42.678
You're more than welcome.

12:47.976 --> 12:52.396
Hey! Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.564
It's the only one
in the county.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.108
I'll be darned if
I let it be shot at.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.651
I'll pay for the damages.

12:57.735 --> 12:58.777
I wanna see this.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.863
Me, too!

13:03.741 --> 13:06.618
Never rode shotgun
on a hearse before.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.925
Let her buck.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.250
New in town?

13:55.335 --> 13:56.460
Yeah.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.753
Where are you from?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.963
Dodge. You?

14:00.590 --> 14:03.550
Tombstone. See any
action up there?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.512
Tombstone?

14:06.596 --> 14:08.931
Same. People all
settled down, like.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.182
Same all over.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.517
Injun lovers!

14:11.601 --> 14:14.311
Easy. Just wind.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.313
We'll get there.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.941
It's not gettin' up there
that bothers me.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.527
It's stayin' up there
that I mind.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.368
Comin' up behind
us on the left.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.581
I don't think so.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.549
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.

14:43.633 --> 14:47.010
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.224
You elected?

14:52.308 --> 14:54.184
No.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.770
I got nominated real good.

14:59.440 --> 15:03.902
Boys, why don't you just turn around now...
save yourselves a lot of trouble?

15:03.987 --> 15:06.905
Soon?

15:09.450 --> 15:12.411
The reception
committee is forming.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.807
Hold it.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.226
Hold it right there.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.981
Anything wrong?

15:46.696 --> 15:50.032
Turn that rig around
and get it down the hill.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.050
I need six men up here.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.412
Yahoo!

16:41.084 --> 16:43.001
Boys, the drinks are on me!

17:18.621 --> 17:20.747
Hey! Hey!

17:20.832 --> 17:24.000
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.089
Thanks.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.466
Where are you from?

17:32.468 --> 17:34.970
Oh, yeah. Where are you goin'?

17:36.848 --> 17:38.807
Thanks for the free show.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.475
You're more than welcome.

17:40.977 --> 17:45.105
Boy, that was really something. I won't
forget that if I live to be a hundred.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.898
Henry, the stage is leavin'!

17:46.983 --> 17:48.150
All right, all right!

17:48.234 --> 17:52.779
Wait till Flora hears about this. Y'know,
she won't believe one word of it.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.240
Henry! The stage! Come on!

17:57.201 --> 17:59.494
You keep this.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.856
Where are you headed?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.358
I'm drifting south,
more or less.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.319
You?

18:32.403 --> 18:34.321
Just driftin'.

18:34.405 --> 18:35.864
Any action here?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.365
Yeah. Grocery clerk and bouncer

18:37.450 --> 18:40.702
in one of those bars across the
street, if that's your taste.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.580
Yeah.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.749
Well... see ya.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.712
Say... what's your name?

18:52.173 --> 18:54.341
Make it Vin.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.550
What's yours?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.010
Chris.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.376
Yes?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.804
We think you are
a man we can trust.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.849
Thank you very much.

19:43.933 --> 19:44.933
We wish you to help us.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.810
There's this man, Calvera.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.395
A thief. A murderer.

19:48.479 --> 19:52.315
He and his men, they steal our food,
and then they leave us to starve.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.150
Not only that, but our women...

19:54.235 --> 19:55.861
Wait, wait. Just a minute.

19:55.945 --> 19:58.363
If you need protection,
go to the rurales.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.031
We did. Twice.

20:00.241 --> 20:05.245
But they can't station men in a small
village for... who knows how long?

20:05.329 --> 20:06.538
So they left.

20:06.622 --> 20:10.792
And when they left, he came again...
Calvera...and every year since.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.795
He will do so
until he is stopped.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.465
Sit down.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.848
We need help.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.892
We must buy guns.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.978
We know nothing about them.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.439
Will you buy guns for us?

20:32.523 --> 20:35.650
Guns are very expensive
and hard to get.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.236
Why don't you hire men?

20:38.321 --> 20:39.362
Men?

20:39.447 --> 20:43.116
Gunmen. Nowadays men
are cheaper than guns.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.284
Will you go?

20:44.368 --> 20:47.120
It will be a blessing
if you help us.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.998
Sorry, I'm not in
the blessing business.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.708
No, no. We offer
more than that.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.376
We could feed you every day.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.794
And we have this.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.963
What's that?

20:57.048 --> 21:00.175
We can sell this for gold.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.344
Everything we own.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.679
Everything of value
in the village.

21:06.682 --> 21:11.478
I've been offered a lot for my
work, but never everything.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.688
Will it be enough?

21:13.773 --> 21:17.609
You see, if we could drive
the bandits away...

21:17.693 --> 21:20.445
life could be very
good in our village.

21:20.529 --> 21:25.325
But as it is, we ourselves could
stand it a little longer...

21:25.409 --> 21:28.828
but the children, they cry
because they're hungry.

21:30.081 --> 21:33.792
Do you understand what it means
when you start something like this?

21:33.876 --> 21:36.169
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.

21:36.253 --> 21:39.297
When Calvera comes, the church
bell will ring the alarm.

21:39.382 --> 21:42.008
We'll fight with guns,
if we have them.

21:42.093 --> 21:45.929
If we don't, with machetes,
axes, clubs, anything!

21:50.601 --> 21:52.602
Once you begin...

21:52.687 --> 21:55.814
you have to be prepared
for killing and more killing.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.733
And still more killing...until
the reason for it has gone.

21:58.818 --> 21:59.943
We understand.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.861
We've considered that.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.823
Does every man in the
village feel the same?

22:04.907 --> 22:06.992
Every man.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.829
I'll see what I can do for you.

22:10.913 --> 22:11.997
Gracias. You know...

22:12.081 --> 22:14.374
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.169
I'll pass the word around
that you're looking for men.

22:18.254 --> 22:22.716
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.

22:23.384 --> 22:26.886
Sure... same as they wear pants.
That's expected.

22:26.971 --> 22:30.390
But good men? That's
something else again.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.976
How can you tell they are good?

22:34.770 --> 22:36.855
There are ways.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.950
Come in.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.414
The word is out
you're looking for men.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.250
That's right. Men who
are good with that.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.918
I'm good with it.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.462
Fast?

23:01.380 --> 23:02.380
Try me.

23:02.465 --> 23:04.507
I aim to. Step in closer.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.721
Now, hold your hands like that.

23:10.765 --> 23:12.849
Now, clap.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.601
Faster.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.978
Now, as fast as you can.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.907
Now you try it.

24:02.358 --> 24:05.151
Very young and...
and very proud.

24:06.445 --> 24:11.407
The graveyards are full of boys who
were very young and very proud.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.795
Come in.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.483
No tricks now, Chris.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.902
Harry! It's good
to see you again.

24:47.987 --> 24:48.987
Chris.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.446
What are you doing
in this dump?

24:50.531 --> 24:52.323
I heard you've got
a contract open.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.075
Not for a high-stepper
like you.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.328
A dollar bill always looks
as big to me as a bedspread.

24:57.413 --> 24:58.997
It's just eating money.

24:59.081 --> 25:03.501
A gold eagle, room and board. Six
weeks gunning for some farmers.

25:03.586 --> 25:08.047
You old Cajun! You don't talk so good,
but you always know what's goin' on.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.216
Oh, Harry.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.679
With your permission.

25:15.681 --> 25:19.517
All right. All that's on top.
What's underneath?

25:19.602 --> 25:20.894
Only what I told you.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.563
Gold? Cattle? Payroll?

25:23.647 --> 25:25.315
Only what I told you.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.650
Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.

25:27.902 --> 25:30.862
Harry, please don't
understand me so fast!

25:30.946 --> 25:33.573
I said never mind. I'm in.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.742
You dirty dog!

25:55.554 --> 25:57.639
Place your bets.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.482
Five.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.695
Five.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.118
Eight.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.333
Eights again. Ten at the point.

26:29.713 --> 26:32.966
The cowpoke that just walked
in in the stovepipe chaps...

26:33.050 --> 26:34.384
I'd like to buy him a drink.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.386
Yes, sir!

26:36.470 --> 26:40.390
VÃ¡lgame Dios. There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.

26:40.474 --> 26:43.685
The man for us is the one
who gave him that face.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.229
Hey... you learn fast.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.899
Next bet comin' up.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.411
Crap.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.668
Next man.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.340
Gent over there
wants to buy you a drink.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.141
Vin.

27:23.225 --> 27:24.267
Howdy.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.477
I'd like to buy you a drink.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.146
Whiskey.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.606
Have you anything lined up?

27:30.691 --> 27:34.527
Yeah. I'm gonna take a
job in a grocery store.

27:34.611 --> 27:38.448
Fella says I'm gonna make
a crackerjack clerk.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.408
Crackerjack.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.785
If that's your taste...

27:44.371 --> 27:48.499
I heard of a job shooin' some flies away
from a village, but I don't know the pay.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.585
$20.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.669
A week?

27:51.754 --> 27:53.546
Six weeks: the whole job.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.882
Well, that's ridiculous.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.303
You heard of anything?

28:00.387 --> 28:01.679
Yeah.

28:01.764 --> 28:05.141
Shooing some flies away
from a little village.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.685
Their village.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.272
It pays $20?

28:12.191 --> 28:14.734
I'm looking for men right now.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.237
No, it wouldn't even
pay for my bullets.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.073
Ours is a poor village.

28:20.157 --> 28:23.409
We understand. You could get
much more in a grocery store...

28:23.494 --> 28:25.578
and it's good, steady work.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.373
Yep.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.502
How many you got?

29:00.572 --> 29:02.532
Looking for O'Reilly.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.117
Don't know his name,

29:04.201 --> 29:07.912
but there's a fella in back
choppin' wood for his breakfast.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.347
Mornin'.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.852
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.020
He tells me you're broke.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.732
Nah, I'm doing this because
I'm an eccentric millionaire

29:36.817 --> 29:41.821
There's a job for six men, watching
over a village, south of the border.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.241
How big's the opposition?

29:45.325 --> 29:47.618
Thirty guns.

29:50.914 --> 29:54.542
I admire your notion
of fair odds, mister.

29:54.626 --> 29:58.087
Harry tells me you faced bigger
odds in the Travis County war.

29:58.172 --> 30:01.924
Well, they paid me
$600 for that one.

30:02.009 --> 30:04.677
He said you got that
Salinas thing cleared up.

30:04.761 --> 30:07.555
They paid me $800 for that one.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.848
You cost a lot.

30:08.932 --> 30:11.225
Yeah...

30:11.310 --> 30:13.895
That's right, I cost a lot.

30:14.521 --> 30:17.148
The offer is $20.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.831
$20?

30:38.378 --> 30:41.005
Right now, that's a lot.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.507
Where can I reach you?

30:42.591 --> 30:44.550
Right here.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.974
I still say he can't.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.184
And I tell you he can.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.186
If he claims that, he's a liar.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.771
Not so loud. He might hear you.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.649
I don't give a damn
if he hears me or not.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.777
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.320
Well, you ain't
bettin' with me.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.446
Me either.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.657
I told you what he said,
and I believe him.

31:07.741 --> 31:09.575
Well, one of us is a fathead.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.118
You can get good odds on which.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.746
Ha! Ha! Ha!

31:21.046 --> 31:23.339
Britt. Britt, wake up.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.677
I'm talkin' to ya! Look at me!

31:31.098 --> 31:35.893
Filene told me what you said. I
say you're wrong. What d'you say?

31:38.981 --> 31:41.065
Ha! Ha! Ha!

31:43.277 --> 31:47.530
What's the matter? You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?!

32:26.361 --> 32:28.529
Call it.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.542
Well, you see, I won.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.836
Well, how about it?

32:47.466 --> 32:49.550
Well?

32:52.554 --> 32:53.721
Filene, how about it?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.598
I don't know.
It was mighty close.

32:55.682 --> 33:00.603
Close? What d'you mean, close? You all got eyes.
You saw what happened. I won!

33:07.110 --> 33:09.236
You tell 'em. I won, didn't I?

33:09.321 --> 33:11.405
You lost.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.175
You're a liar.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.971
I said you're a liar!

33:37.516 --> 33:39.850
I said you're
a coward and a liar!

33:43.689 --> 33:46.732
Get up. Let's do it for real.

33:47.901 --> 33:49.485
Get up!

33:49.569 --> 33:52.196
Get up, I said!

33:52.280 --> 33:56.200
So help me, I'll let you
have it right where you are.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.380
Call it!

34:09.464 --> 34:10.464
I want nothin' to do with this.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.549
Call it!

34:11.632 --> 34:12.632
Drop it, Wallace. Forget it.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.511
Get away from me.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.693
Call it.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.982
Britt.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.192
Chris.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.196
Can I have a word with you?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.832
Did you have any luck?

35:26.917 --> 35:30.127
Found a man who would
have been perfect.

35:30.212 --> 35:34.924
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.

35:35.008 --> 35:37.259
The money? It wasn't enough?

35:37.636 --> 35:39.929
He doesn't care
a hoot about money.

35:40.013 --> 35:43.474
A man in this line of work who
doesn't care about money?!

35:43.558 --> 35:48.479
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.

35:48.563 --> 35:52.024
Others, for reasons of their
own, enjoy only the danger.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.026
And the competition.

35:54.110 --> 35:58.948
If he's the best with a knife and
a gun, with whom does he compete?

35:59.032 --> 36:00.699
Himself.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.164
You.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.045
I've been looking for you!

36:13.129 --> 36:15.089
What have we got here?

36:15.173 --> 36:17.007
Never mind.

36:17.092 --> 36:19.176
He knows.

36:19.970 --> 36:23.138
Clap hands, he says.

36:23.223 --> 36:26.934
Clap your hands, and let's
see how fast you are.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.854
Clap hands!

36:30.689 --> 36:33.816
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him...

36:35.569 --> 36:38.696
cos he'd be proud
to work with him.

36:39.948 --> 36:44.076
He makes me look like two cents
with some damned kids' game!

36:44.160 --> 36:45.327
Hey, kid, that's
enough of that!

36:45.412 --> 36:48.455
You stay away from me, will ya?

36:55.589 --> 36:57.965
Come on, now...

36:58.049 --> 37:00.593
and let's see how fast you are.

37:02.679 --> 37:06.849
And no games? No clapping
hands...none of that stuff!

37:07.601 --> 37:09.602
Just draw.

37:09.686 --> 37:12.271
Come on. Come on, draw!

37:13.398 --> 37:14.815
Campesino. Come on!

37:14.900 --> 37:16.859
You say campesino to me?!

37:17.861 --> 37:20.946
You get out of my way,
you dirt farmer!

37:33.627 --> 37:36.337
You don't think I mean it?

37:39.090 --> 37:41.592
You... think I'm just talking?

37:58.068 --> 38:00.361
Hey... get up.

38:02.197 --> 38:04.531
Do you hear me?

38:07.035 --> 38:09.370
Get up and face me!

38:10.413 --> 38:12.665
Do you hear?!

38:53.039 --> 38:55.124
Hey...

38:58.086 --> 39:00.421
give him my gun.

39:14.394 --> 39:17.146
Sorry this happened, friend.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.690
Let him sleep it off.

39:19.774 --> 39:23.694
When he wakes up,
let him have his gun back.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.613
And give him a drink.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.076
I changed my mind.

39:38.668 --> 39:43.255
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.

40:02.317 --> 40:04.693
Remember me?

40:10.825 --> 40:12.993
Yep.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.287
You need men to
do a job in Mexico.

40:15.371 --> 40:16.371
That's right.

40:16.456 --> 40:17.498
How long?

40:17.582 --> 40:19.291
Four, six weeks.

40:19.375 --> 40:23.128
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?

40:24.714 --> 40:28.217
I thought you were looking
for the Johnson brothers.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.677
I found them.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.596
How much does the job pay?

40:32.680 --> 40:34.681
20. We leave tomorrow.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.352
I'll have the money
before I leave.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.522
It'll just take care of
my last two days' rent.

40:41.606 --> 40:45.275
$20? You must
be livin' in style.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.902
Yes.

40:46.986 --> 40:51.865
I have the most stylish corner of
the filthy storeroom out back.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.201
That, and one plate of beans:

40:55.036 --> 40:56.745
$10 a day.

40:56.955 --> 41:00.332
Yeah, things do get high when
they find out you're on the run.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.127
There's a dry wash
south of town.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.172
Pick me up there.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.723
He's a good gun.

41:17.517 --> 41:20.269
And we aren't heading
for a church social.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.500
Chris.

41:44.544 --> 41:47.462
Yeah. He picked us up at dawn.

41:49.299 --> 41:50.591
Any idea who it is?

41:50.675 --> 41:52.926
Yeah. That kid from the saloon.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.887
Won't take no for an answer.

41:54.971 --> 41:57.431
Doesn't show much
sense, does he?

42:15.283 --> 42:18.452
I'm getting a stiff neck
keepin' track of him.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.705
If you can't forget him, why
don't you ride side-saddle?

42:21.789 --> 42:24.666
Well... he won't
last much longer.

42:24.751 --> 42:27.044
That so?

42:27.962 --> 42:32.007
Ridin' out there in all that dust
and heat...what a chucklehead!

42:32.091 --> 42:34.426
Yeah. Not smart like us

42:36.304 --> 42:38.388
Yep.

42:45.188 --> 42:48.315
Suppose our friend over there
has got anything to eat?

42:48.399 --> 42:50.359
How about I bring him some?

42:50.443 --> 42:52.110
It isn't food he's hungry for.

42:52.195 --> 42:56.531
Then let me tie a can to his tail. Right
now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.

42:56.616 --> 42:59.868
Leave him alone.
It's a free country.

42:59.953 --> 43:02.037
And it's his.

43:34.237 --> 43:38.198
You know, it's funny. Now that
he's gone, I kinda miss him.

45:23.179 --> 45:25.514
Where is everybody?

45:26.516 --> 45:28.100
Where are they, Tomas?

45:28.184 --> 45:30.769
Luis! AsunciÃ³n! Demetrio!

45:30.853 --> 45:34.356
Emilio! Sotero! What kind
of a reception is this?

45:34.440 --> 45:39.361
Come out! Come out and make them
welcome, before we die of shame.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.905
Hilario, stop your shouting.

45:50.206 --> 45:53.625
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?!

45:53.709 --> 45:56.128
Come in. You must be thirsty.

45:57.755 --> 46:00.924
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.

46:01.008 --> 46:03.510
They are afraid of
everyone and everything.

46:03.594 --> 46:06.263
They are afraid
of rain, and no rain...

46:06.389 --> 46:10.392
The summer may be too hot, the winter...
too cold.

46:10.476 --> 46:14.146
The sow has no pigs, the farmer
is afraid he may starve.

46:14.230 --> 46:17.357
She has too many,
he's afraid she may starve.

46:18.359 --> 46:22.946
There's no need to apologize. We
didn't expect flowers and speeches.

46:23.030 --> 46:26.950
Tomorrow is the anniversary of
the founding of the village.

46:27.034 --> 46:31.204
They will be celebrating...then, you
will see them in a better light.

46:48.681 --> 46:51.308
Who sounded the alarm?

46:54.604 --> 46:57.189
Who sounded the alarm?!

47:00.610 --> 47:03.153
I did.

47:16.125 --> 47:19.753
Thank you, amigos, for
coming out to greet us.

47:19.837 --> 47:22.589
Thank you for letting us
see your beautiful faces

47:22.673 --> 47:25.675
Thank you, thank
you, you chickens!

47:26.344 --> 47:29.054
You come running
out like chickens!

47:29.889 --> 47:33.517
We ride to this
middle of nowhere.

47:33.601 --> 47:35.227
We're ready to risk
our lives to help you.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.229
And you?

47:37.313 --> 47:39.564
You hide from us!

47:42.944 --> 47:44.736
Hide... from us!

47:50.034 --> 47:53.870
But it's a different story
when you're in danger.

47:55.122 --> 47:57.749
You might lose
your precious crops.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.418
Then you flock to us.

48:04.048 --> 48:07.634
Well... we're here,
my compadres and I.

48:08.469 --> 48:11.346
And here we stay.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.099
And you?

48:14.183 --> 48:18.603
You prove to us that
you're worth fighting for.

48:18.688 --> 48:22.607
Now get back to your houses,
back to work. Go on! Go back.

48:22.692 --> 48:27.404
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back! All of you, go back!

48:27.488 --> 48:29.447
Go back!

48:41.919 --> 48:44.004
Now we're seven.

49:13.451 --> 49:17.746
You know, I've been in some towns
where the girls aren't very pretty.

49:17.830 --> 49:22.042
As a matter of fact, I've been in some
towns where they were downright ugly.

49:22.126 --> 49:25.712
But this is the first time I've been in
a town where there's no girls at all.

49:25.796 --> 49:27.922
Except little ones.

49:28.007 --> 49:31.760
If we're not careful, we can
have quite a social life here

49:31.844 --> 49:36.431
Oh, it's not so bad. I fell in with a fast
crowd that hangs out near the fountain.

49:36.515 --> 49:40.894
We got to predictin' the weather for
today and didn't break up till twilight.

49:49.195 --> 49:52.781
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!

51:11.193 --> 51:12.235
Hilario!

52:05.873 --> 52:07.957
Britt.

52:08.793 --> 52:13.505
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.757
Lee.

52:15.841 --> 52:17.675
Get one alive.

52:17.760 --> 52:18.968
Yes.

52:20.221 --> 52:22.472
I'll show you where.

52:23.265 --> 52:26.392
Rico, he knows
where the arroyo is.

55:39.712 --> 55:41.337
I'm sorry, Britt. I
didn't mean to spoil it.

55:41.422 --> 55:43.840
Shut up!

55:52.683 --> 55:57.478
Oh... That... that was the
greatest shot I've ever seen.

55:57.563 --> 55:59.605
The worst.

55:59.690 --> 56:02.108
I was aiming at the horse.

56:23.839 --> 56:27.091
Three men were sent
by Calvera to spy.

56:27.176 --> 56:30.011
It's almost certain
they saw us.

56:36.560 --> 56:39.103
Whatever they learned
will be buried with them.

56:39.188 --> 56:41.439
Â¡VÃ¡lgame Dios!
If he comes now...

56:41.732 --> 56:46.444
He'd never send men ahead if he was
near enough to see for himself.

56:46.528 --> 56:51.407
So we have time to get ready. And
we have something else... surprise.

56:52.034 --> 56:56.788
If he rides in with no idea of the
reception we can prepare for him...

56:56.872 --> 57:00.666
I promise you, we'll all teach him
something about the price of corn.

57:01.585 --> 57:03.503
Aim...

57:03.587 --> 57:05.880
squeeze...

57:05.964 --> 57:08.925
cock.

57:09.009 --> 57:10.843
Aim...

57:10.928 --> 57:13.012
squeeze...

57:13.764 --> 57:15.056
cock.

57:16.100 --> 57:21.354
Settle down. Now, you miss the first
chance, you may not get a second.

57:22.898 --> 57:27.110
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.

57:27.194 --> 57:30.822
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.

57:30.906 --> 57:36.410
Now, close your eye. Aim from
here, to here, to the target.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.288
Fire.

57:39.373 --> 57:41.290
That rock?

57:41.375 --> 57:43.709
No, that man you're gonna kill.

57:47.506 --> 57:49.423
Good!

57:49.508 --> 57:52.135
If only we had more guns,
think what we could do!

57:52.219 --> 57:53.636
You'll get more guns.

57:53.720 --> 57:54.929
How?

57:55.013 --> 57:58.224
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.

57:58.308 --> 58:00.852
The ones who spied
on us brought them.

58:00.936 --> 58:03.354
Like three kings bearing gifts.

58:11.697 --> 58:15.408
If Calvera does not come
now, after all of this...

58:15.492 --> 58:17.702
what a waste!

58:23.959 --> 58:26.460
A pretty foxy fellow,
this Calvera, eh?

58:26.545 --> 58:29.589
SeÃ±or, not a fox. A coyote!

58:31.675 --> 58:34.844
How did he ever find out
about the gold mine?

58:34.928 --> 58:37.013
Gold mine?

58:38.557 --> 58:40.808
What gold mine, seÃ±or?

58:40.893 --> 58:43.519
You know, the one
in the mountains.

58:43.604 --> 58:45.438
In our mountains?

58:45.522 --> 58:48.065
We never had a gold
mine around here.

58:49.109 --> 58:52.904
Say, come to think of it,
it was a silver mine.

58:52.988 --> 58:54.739
Whatever happened to it?

58:54.823 --> 58:56.908
We have no silver mine either.

58:56.992 --> 58:58.701
I mean in the old days.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.995
Not at any time.

59:01.079 --> 59:04.665
Where did you hear of
this gold and silver?

59:06.043 --> 59:09.629
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk.

59:53.090 --> 59:55.174
Toro.

59:58.011 --> 59:59.887
Toro.

59:59.972 --> 01:00:02.181
Â¡Toro!

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:04.976
Come on, little bull!

01:00:10.399 --> 01:00:12.483
Toro.

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:25.579
Toro.

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:28.100
You do anything to me and I'll
kill you while you are doing it.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.478
You almost took my eye out!

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:32.938
Let me go. Let me go!

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:35.900
Oh, you bite me
and I'll bite you!

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:39.111
I got a good mind
to throw you in the water.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:41.864
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:44.241
Shut up. Shut up!

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:49.372
Where are the others?

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.248
I'll never tell you.

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:28.369
Look what I found.

01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:39.255
Who is she?

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:41.048
From our village.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:49.265
So that's where they were.
You hid them.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:52.059
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:55.646
They're afraid. She's afraid
of me, you, him... all of us.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:59.525
Farmers! Their families
told them we'd rape them.

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:03.821
Well, we might.

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:08.367
In my opinion, though, you might have
given us the benefit of the doubt.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:11.036
But... just as you please.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:15.833
As long as you were out there,
why didn't you bring 'em all in?

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:18.544
What for? Leave them out there.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:21.255
Let Calvera find them. He'll
take good care of them.

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:22.548
Bring them in.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.717
Show him the way.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.886
Ma'am.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:35.603
Come on, little angel

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:44.612
Gently, boy.

01:03:45.447 --> 01:03:47.531
Gently.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:32.535
I can't tell you how wonderful it was
for you seÃ±oritas to fix dinner for us.

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:45.923
How's the food?

01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:47.800
Great.

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:51.554
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada
and Spanish rice. Looks good.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:55.057
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:58.727
Do you know what the villagers have
been eating since we got here?

01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:01.730
Tortillas and a few
beans, that's all.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.151
Thank you.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:07.611
You're welcome.

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:08.862
Thank you.

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:10.489
You're welcome.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.741
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:14.910
Do you have an older,
grateful sister at home?

01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:17.079
No, sir. Many thanks.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:18.747
You're welcome.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:20.291
Many thanks.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:23.335
One, two, three, four.

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:26.630
One, two, three, four.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.675
One, two, three, four.

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.970
One, two, three, four.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:36.265
One, two, three, four.

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:37.766
One, two...

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.268
three, four.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:42.271
One, two, three, four.

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:44.690
Squeeze.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:48.861
Miguel, didn't I tell
you to squeeze? Hm?

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:51.447
Just like when you're
milking a goat, Miguel.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:52.865
It's that I get excited.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.992
Well, don't get excited!

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.622
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:02.041
All right... squeeze.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.963
Squeeze!

01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:11.717
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:15.638
You take the gun like this and you
use it like a club. All right?

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:16.805
Right.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.974
Flaco!

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.727
Muchas gracias.

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:51.674
Good afternoon.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:53.092
Howdy.

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:55.928
We've come to move you
into the village.

01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:58.472
Move into the village?! Me?!

01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:00.099
Everybody who lives outside.

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:02.101
Oh, no.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:04.269
We can't protect you out here.

01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:07.106
Rojas is makin' room
for you in his home.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:11.360
Rojas?! His conversation
would bore me to death!

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:15.030
Yeah, well...

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:17.574
maybe somebody else?

01:07:17.659 --> 01:07:19.118
They are all farmers.

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:23.122
Farmers talk of nothing
but fertilizer and women.

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:27.209
I've never shared their
enthusiasm for fertilizer.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:32.256
As for women... I became
indifferent when I was 83.

01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:35.384
I am staying here.

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:41.974
Yeah, well... what are you
gonna do when Calvera comes?

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:45.102
At my age, a little
excitement is welcome.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.272
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:51.483
Bullets cost money.

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:54.778
All right. Have it your way.

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.573
You worry about yourself.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.825
Are you ready for him?

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:02.161
What if he comes now, eh?

01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:05.164
It's like that fella who fell
off a ten-storey building.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.082
What about him?

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:11.420
As he was falling, people on each floor
heard him say "So far, so good."

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.797
So far, so good!

01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:44.036
First of all,
they'll see that ditch.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.371
More water for the corn.

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:52.377
Awful lot of new walls.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.212
Civic improvements.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.716
Hey, Chris...

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:01.220
what about that net, eh?

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:04.055
Well, if he's not
looking for it...

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.475
If he rides in unsuspecting.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.394
If, brother!

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.563
If!

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:15.067
Yeah.

01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:17.236
Yeah!

01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:55.560
I should have guessed. When my men
didn't come back, I should have guessed.

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.689
How many of you did they hire?

01:11:58.773 --> 01:11:59.856
Enough.

01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:07.823
New wall!

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:10.409
There are lots of new walls.
All around.

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:16.581
They won't keep me out.

01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:19.418
They were built to keep you in.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:32.222
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:36.435
All forty of us!
By these three.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:40.105
Or is it four? They couldn't
afford to hire more than that.

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:42.858
We come cheaper by the bunch.

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:44.693
Five!

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:47.571
Even five won't give
us too much trouble.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:52.034
There won't be any trouble
If you ride on.

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:53.618
Ride on?

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.912
I'm going into
the hills for the winter.

01:12:55.997 --> 01:12:58.040
Where am I going
to get food for my men?

01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:00.375
Buy it or grow it.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.878
Or maybe even work for it!

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.963
Seven!

01:13:05.089 --> 01:13:08.383
Somehow, I don't think
you've solved my problem.

01:13:08.468 --> 01:13:11.219
Solving your problems
isn't our line.

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:13.638
We deal in lead, friend.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:17.934
So do I. We're in the
same business.

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.353
Only as competitors.

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:22.731
Why not as partners?

01:13:23.775 --> 01:13:25.901
Suppose I offer
you equal shares?

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:27.235
In what?

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.571
Everything. To the last grain.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:32.657
And the people in the village?
What about them?

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:36.661
I leave it to you.

01:13:36.788 --> 01:13:40.332
Can men of our profession
worry about things like that?

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:43.335
May even be sacrilegious.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:49.841
If God didn't want them sheared,
he would not have made them sheep.

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:51.718
What do you say?

01:13:51.803 --> 01:13:53.011
Ride on.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:00.102
You hear that, Sotero?

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:03.522
You hear what he said?

01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:05.607
Ride on.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.776
To me!

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:14.866
You tell him to ride on
before I become angry.

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:17.119
Him, and the others!

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:21.039
Because, if I leave
with empty hands...

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:25.877
everybody in this village will
answer to me...when I come back!

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.963
You won't come back.

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:29.297
Why not?

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.716
You won't have any guns.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:35.387
Take them off right
now and drop them.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:42.727
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:49.067
I leave these people a little bit extra
and they hire these men to make trouble.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:54.072
It shows you... sooner or later, you
must answer for every good deed.

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:30.478
You were safe.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:35.233
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.

01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:37.277
The last time you
told it, it was five!

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:39.070
They multiply like rabbits!

01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:41.323
Ten. Ten!

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:49.664
They got a good
kick in the behind.

01:17:49.749 --> 01:17:51.416
If they try it again,
they'll get another!

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.001
We'll tear them to pieces.

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:56.087
We'll bury them all.
Calvera too!

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.759
Any sign of 'em?

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.510
No.

01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:04.346
That is bad luck.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:07.891
Can you imagine? I knew
him when he was a mouse!

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:14.272
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.

01:18:14.398 --> 01:18:16.733
I would never have guessed it.

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:18.610
Well, he'll leave us
alone from now on.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.612
- You think so?
- Of course.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.615
He'll go away.
There are other villages...

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:26.451
other villages that don't
sting the way we do.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:27.702
SeÃ±or!

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:39.089
Neighbors...
I drink to our friends.

01:18:40.091 --> 01:18:45.387
They armed us, fought at our sides,
and will forever live in our hearts.

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:59.109
They haven't gone, then.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:15.917
See the gun flashin'?

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:17.252
No.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:20.422
I make it two of them.

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:21.631
Three.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:28.430
Fool kid's gonna get
his head blown off.

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:44.696
Chico! Stay put.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.451
Three?

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:50.702
Three.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:58.543
O'Reilly? Do you see them?

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:02.714
No... They're too
far back in the trees.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:04.883
- Chris.
- Yeah?

01:20:05.009 --> 01:20:09.679
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:16.728
Chico... cover the back door.

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:48.176
Get back!

01:20:49.428 --> 01:20:51.763
Get back! Go on!

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:54.349
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?

01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:56.935
Get down. Now stay down!

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:03.358
Crazy kids! You might
have been hurt.

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:04.484
So might you.

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:06.861
It's not the same thing.

01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:08.363
This is my work.

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:10.365
It's our work, too.

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:14.035
Everyone tells us "Hide! Get back!
Stay out of sight!"

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:15.662
But we're not afraid.

01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:17.789
He's very brave.
It's the truth.

01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:21.960
So is he. We all are -
every boy in the village.

01:21:26.423 --> 01:21:29.926
We had a meeting and we
drew straws and we got you.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.472
You got me? What d'you
mean, you got me?

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:37.058
If you get killed,
we avenge you.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:41.646
And we see to it that there's
always fresh flowers on your grave.

01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:47.569
That's a mighty big comfort

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:50.655
I told you he would
appreciate that.

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:54.242
Don't you kids be too disappointed
if your plans don't work out.

01:21:54.326 --> 01:21:57.412
We won't. If you stay alive,
we'll be just as happy.

01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:59.664
Maybe even happier.

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:02.333
Maybe.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:22.604
Can you see them?

01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:24.772
No.

01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:35.700
Do your...

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:38.494
hands sweat before a fight?

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.499
Every time.

01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:45.710
Mine are sweatin' now.

01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:48.713
Funny...

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:52.300
Hands sweat...

01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:55.053
mouth is dry.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:58.473
You'd think it would be
the other way around.

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:05.813
Does my... talking annoy you?

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:11.569
It's because I'm...

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:15.156
I'm frightened, you know?

01:23:16.367 --> 01:23:20.328
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish you'd
given your crops to Calvera?

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:22.497
Yes...

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:25.875
and no.

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:29.045
Both at the same time.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.757
Yes, when I think of...

01:23:32.883 --> 01:23:34.926
of what he might do.

01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:41.766
No, when I remember the feeling
in my chest this morning...

01:23:41.892 --> 01:23:44.060
as I saw him run away.

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:47.021
From us.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:50.108
Man...

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:53.861
that's a feeling
worth dying for!

01:23:54.405 --> 01:23:57.615
Have you ever...
felt something like that?

01:23:57.783 --> 01:24:00.201
Not for a long, long time.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:04.789
I...

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:07.458
envy you.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.637
What are you doing here?

01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:21.139
You shouldn't do
things like you did.

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:22.223
Go back.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:24.142
You mustn't take
foolish chances.

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:26.644
All right, I won't.
But go back.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:30.982
Does it hurt?

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:32.817
What?

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:46.998
No.

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:50.668
I'm sorry I did it,
but I thought...

01:24:51.754 --> 01:24:53.629
You know what I thought.

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:55.339
Yes, yes. I know.

01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:59.010
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.

01:25:00.179 --> 01:25:02.597
He says "Stay away
from those men."

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.100
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."

01:25:06.185 --> 01:25:09.187
He's right. Do you
know that? He's right.

01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:12.940
Well... go back home now.

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.693
He is wrong.

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:20.782
Well... go home anyway...

01:25:20.866 --> 01:25:23.201
before he finds
out you're here.

01:25:24.661 --> 01:25:26.871
He already knows.

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:30.374
He said he'd punish me
for being so shameless.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.544
But I don't care.

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:48.643
They got them.
They got them all!

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:49.811
Result.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.229
Do you think
they'll try that again?

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:53.564
I doubt it.

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:56.067
For all they know, we're still
out there ready to jump them.

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.486
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:01.155
Did you think it
would be that easy?

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:04.075
What do we do now?

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:05.660
Well, what do you say?

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:06.786
Me?

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.996
We work for you, you know.

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:12.333
What else is there
to do but... wait?

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:14.168
It's Calvera's move.

01:26:14.253 --> 01:26:15.336
Right.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:18.506
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.424
- If you were Calvera...
- Yes?

01:26:20.551 --> 01:26:22.218
You'd go away, wouldn't you?

01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:25.680
If you'd paid the price
we make him pay.

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:26.931
Yes, I would, only...

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.099
Only what?

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:31.394
Only I'm not Calvera.

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:35.690
Take the rifles and the
bandoleras and pass 'em out.

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:38.234
Now, let's get out
there on duty.

01:26:49.246 --> 01:26:51.205
Food, woman.

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:53.416
They'll be hungry.

01:27:19.318 --> 01:27:21.986
That was... that
was the greatest...

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:24.614
New hat for you, sonny.

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:28.618
Hey!

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:30.620
How do I look?

01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:32.496
Big improvement.

01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:41.005
You know what? They'll make up
a song about you and this hat.

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:46.427
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.

01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:47.845
Do you think it's worth it?

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:49.597
Don't you?

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:52.016
It's only a matter of
knowing how to shoot a gun.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:54.852
Nothing big about that.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:02.360
Hey... how can
you talk like this?

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.698
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:10.034
Mm?

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.410
Well, isn't that true?

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:13.621
Yeah, sure. Everything.

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:17.041
After a while you can call
bartenders by their first name.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.459
Maybe 200 of 'em.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:22.880
Rented rooms you live in: 500. Meals
you eat in hash houses: 1,000.

01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:25.633
Home: none. Wife: none. Kids:

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:29.220
None.

01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:31.514
Prospects: zero.

01:28:32.849 --> 01:28:34.976
Suppose I left anything out?

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.894
Yeah.

01:28:36.979 --> 01:28:39.647
Places you are
tied down to: none.

01:28:40.399 --> 01:28:42.817
People with
a hold on you: none.

01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:45.653
Men you step aside for: none.

01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:49.073
Insults swallowed:

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:50.992
None.

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:53.411
Enemies: none.

01:28:55.706 --> 01:28:58.416
No enemies?

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:01.585
Alive.

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:05.339
Well! This is the kind
of arithmetic I like!

01:29:05.424 --> 01:29:07.675
Yeah, so did I at your age.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:10.511
Give these to someone who
knows how to use them.

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:12.930
Yeah.

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:16.100
Why don't you ask Calvera what
he has in mind for tonight?

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:19.562
Yes, do that. And I'll write
a song for you myself.

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:29.113
AndrÃ©s, Lorenzo and
Felipe never came back.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.282
That's three.

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:34.410
Armando in the plaza.

01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:35.703
That's four.

01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:39.373
And Jorge and Memo in the pass,

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:41.042
where they were caught
by that cursed net.

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:42.376
Damn them!

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:44.962
Five and six.

01:29:45.047 --> 01:29:48.132
Emilio going over the wall.

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:49.800
Seven.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:52.303
JosÃ© near the fountain.

01:29:57.309 --> 01:29:58.976
Eight.

01:29:59.061 --> 01:30:01.645
Gregorio near the fountain.

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:09.737
That's nine.

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.074
Nine.

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:15.326
Fortuno by the water ditch.

01:30:15.452 --> 01:30:19.330
Rico in the fields, where
they slashed him to pieces!

01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.792
That's... 10 and 11.

01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:26.587
Go on.

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:28.506
Talk.

01:30:28.632 --> 01:30:30.674
Talk! Talk!

01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:36.680
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.

01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:40.684
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:44.647
Our friends down below.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:58.035
Please, no!

01:31:10.799 --> 01:31:13.300
It's all right.
You're all right.

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:16.387
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:25.020
Have no fear.

01:31:27.566 --> 01:31:29.650
"Have no fear"?

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:34.238
My very words.

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.408
10,000 times a day.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.828
SeÃ±or, don't punish yourself.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:45.416
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.

01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:57.011
Until the day
you lose your nerve.

01:31:58.597 --> 01:32:00.723
You feel it.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:04.101
And then you wait...

01:32:05.187 --> 01:32:08.606
for the bullet in the gun
that is faster than yours.

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:10.482
SeÃ±or, don't.

01:32:10.567 --> 01:32:12.693
And the lies you tell,
to fool yourself.

01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:17.031
No enemies:

01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:19.241
Alive.

01:32:21.411 --> 01:32:24.538
I have lost count
of my enemies.

01:32:25.457 --> 01:32:27.208
But you're with friends now.

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:29.043
Yes.

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:31.921
The final, supreme idiocy:

01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:35.549
Comin' here to hide.

01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:42.223
The deserter... hidin' out in
the middle of a battlefield.

01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:01.784
One.

01:33:03.453 --> 01:33:06.830
There was a time when I
woulda caught all three.

01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:22.429
We know what fear is.

01:33:22.514 --> 01:33:25.140
We live with it all our lives.

01:33:26.476 --> 01:33:28.686
Only the dead are without fear.

01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:41.657
Rico!

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.538
Rico!

01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:50.040
One minute, Mother!

01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:54.461
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep,
and then we'll be back on duty.

01:33:54.546 --> 01:33:56.547
All right, Bernardo?

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:58.132
Yes, but not you, Juan.

01:33:58.216 --> 01:34:00.551
You're too young. Come on.

01:34:04.556 --> 01:34:06.682
Bernardo O'Reilly!

01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.727
You've been adopted.

01:34:10.645 --> 01:34:12.396
Yeah, it's my real name.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:16.900
Mexican on one side, Irish on the
other, and me in the middle.

01:34:20.405 --> 01:34:22.740
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.

01:34:24.576 --> 01:34:27.494
See? All three, right side up.

01:34:27.579 --> 01:34:28.537
Think you can do it?

01:34:28.621 --> 01:34:30.998
Of course. That's very easy.

01:34:31.082 --> 01:34:34.835
Would you... care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:36.545
You know we have no money.

01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:38.005
It doesn't have to be money.

01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:42.426
Whatever you have hidden away, buried
out where Calvera can't find it.

01:34:42.552 --> 01:34:44.011
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?!

01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:48.766
Yeah. They tell me a lotta precious stones
have been dug out of the mountains.

01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:51.602
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.

01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:53.687
Oh, yes. Yes, that's very true.

01:34:53.772 --> 01:34:55.356
There's no denyin' it.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.359
Well, then!

01:35:00.779 --> 01:35:04.031
No! When you're finished, they
should all be right side up.

01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:06.408
Let me try it again, eh?

01:35:10.955 --> 01:35:14.208
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:16.960
As you say, seÃ±or,
in the mountains.

01:35:17.087 --> 01:35:18.712
Where in the mountains?

01:35:18.797 --> 01:35:20.381
That I couldn't tell you.

01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:22.299
There! I got it!

01:35:22.384 --> 01:35:25.469
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?

01:35:25.595 --> 01:35:28.305
Because I never have found
any precious stones.

01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:34.395
Wait. You mean Aztec treasure buried in
the hills, from when the Spaniards came?

01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:39.149
That's exactly what I mean. Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?

01:35:39.275 --> 01:35:42.152
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:45.072
I'd be living in a big
city, in a palace.

01:35:45.156 --> 01:35:48.742
Then tell me this...how come
Calvera keeps hangin' around here?

01:35:48.827 --> 01:35:52.913
Calvera... We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.

01:35:52.997 --> 01:35:55.249
No, he will not.

01:35:57.252 --> 01:35:58.836
He won't go anywhere.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.170
Why do you say that?

01:36:00.296 --> 01:36:02.756
Calvera isn't worried
about food for winter.

01:36:02.841 --> 01:36:07.678
He's worried about the food his men
haven't eaten for the last three days.

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:11.265
The price of corn is going up.

01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:12.933
They're starving.

01:36:13.017 --> 01:36:14.768
How do you know?

01:36:14.853 --> 01:36:16.937
Starving and broke.

01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:18.856
How do you know?!

01:36:19.691 --> 01:36:21.817
Oh...

01:36:22.819 --> 01:36:24.862
I've been up there.

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:29.450
Well, we'd better
be ready for them.

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:31.577
Because they gotta die or win.

01:36:31.661 --> 01:36:34.204
VÃ¡lgame Dios if they do win.

01:36:34.289 --> 01:36:35.664
They won't win.

01:36:35.748 --> 01:36:37.708
Are you God, that you
can say for sure?

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:40.794
We're surrounded. Outnumbered.
What are we to do?

01:36:40.879 --> 01:36:43.380
Keep on fighting.

01:36:43.465 --> 01:36:45.716
Do you want to see us
killed off one by one?

01:36:45.842 --> 01:36:48.469
That is not what
you were hired for.

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:50.637
Once you start,
there's no stopping.

01:36:50.722 --> 01:36:52.473
You understood that,
and I told him!

01:36:52.557 --> 01:36:54.224
I don't care.

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:57.728
Go away. All of you. Get
on your horses and go.

01:36:57.812 --> 01:36:59.313
Let Calvera have the food.

01:36:59.397 --> 01:37:00.397
Give him what he wants.

01:37:00.565 --> 01:37:02.191
At least we'll be alive.

01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:03.901
Quiet! And listen to me!

01:37:03.985 --> 01:37:06.487
No! It is easy
for them to say fight.

01:37:06.571 --> 01:37:10.073
They have no sons,
no daughters, no wives.

01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:12.576
Go. Now, before it's too late.

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:21.668
Is that what you want?

01:37:22.212 --> 01:37:23.754
Answer me!

01:37:24.088 --> 01:37:29.009
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.

01:37:35.016 --> 01:37:38.685
Don't be fools! You'll turn
our village into a graveyard.

01:37:38.770 --> 01:37:42.105
Tell them to go. It's the
only thing for them to do.

01:37:42.273 --> 01:37:44.441
I'll tell you what I can do.

01:37:44.567 --> 01:37:48.529
I can kill the first man who so much
as whispers a word about giving up.

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:52.574
The very first man, so help
me, I'll blow his head off!

01:38:17.642 --> 01:38:22.062
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!

01:38:22.146 --> 01:38:24.314
With or without you.

01:38:39.163 --> 01:38:41.248
I'm not sayin' we bit off
more than we can chew...

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:44.501
but we oughta talk about
what we're gonna do.

01:38:44.627 --> 01:38:47.170
We start acting like we
had some good sense.

01:38:47.297 --> 01:38:51.174
We figured to raise the ante just enough
to make Calvera play someplace else.

01:38:51.301 --> 01:38:52.759
We figured wrong.

01:38:52.844 --> 01:38:54.678
We're the only game in town.

01:38:54.804 --> 01:38:56.096
A man can't call 'em all.

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:57.264
I didn't say he could.

01:38:57.348 --> 01:39:01.768
All I'm saying is that sometimes you
bend with the breeze... or you break.

01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:06.273
D'you wanna go?

01:39:06.357 --> 01:39:11.862
There comes a time to get out. The village
will be no worse off than before we came.

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:15.365
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.

01:39:15.491 --> 01:39:17.492
It's not the kind
courts enforce.

01:39:17.577 --> 01:39:19.453
That's just the kind
you've gotta keep.

01:39:19.537 --> 01:39:23.040
A noble thought, but the way
things are right now...

01:39:25.001 --> 01:39:26.418
I don't know.

01:39:26.502 --> 01:39:28.462
The odds are too high.

01:39:28.546 --> 01:39:30.547
- Much too high.
- Then we go?

01:39:30.673 --> 01:39:32.716
No.

01:39:34.302 --> 01:39:36.637
We lower the odds.

01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:39.139
Right up into the hills...

01:39:39.223 --> 01:39:41.308
past the men on guard...

01:39:41.392 --> 01:39:43.560
right into their camp.

01:39:46.064 --> 01:39:50.651
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette
with them, we discussed a few things.

01:39:52.862 --> 01:39:54.905
We... you know...

01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:59.159
All of a sudden,
there was Calvera himself.

01:40:01.079 --> 01:40:04.748
Right beside me. When I
brought back the news...

01:40:04.874 --> 01:40:09.503
you should have seen the look I
got from Britt...and from Chris.

01:40:09.587 --> 01:40:13.590
They have seen a thing or two in
their time, and done them too.

01:40:13.716 --> 01:40:17.594
They're not men you can
impress easily. Oh, no.

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:22.057
But when they looked at me, I
knew I was one of them at last.

01:40:27.397 --> 01:40:29.272
Well...

01:40:29.399 --> 01:40:32.109
you'd better take
a look at me, too.

01:40:32.235 --> 01:40:36.363
Am I the kind of man who'd
live in a place like this?

01:40:37.281 --> 01:40:39.866
Digging my life away
out in the fields?

01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:42.244
Me, a farmer...a peasant?

01:40:44.455 --> 01:40:47.207
You know what I'm saying?

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:51.128
Wherever they go
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others...

01:40:52.255 --> 01:40:54.589
I go with them.

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:59.136
And if you think you,
or anything you do,

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.555
could make me change
my mind, forget it.

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:06.268
I want you to understand that.

01:41:08.062 --> 01:41:10.772
I... want you
to understand that...

01:41:13.985 --> 01:41:16.069
this...

01:41:23.995 --> 01:41:26.621
will get you nothing but this.

01:41:29.459 --> 01:41:32.419
We're going to hit Calvera...

01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:35.589
maybe drive off
some of his horses.

01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:38.341
Then if he attacks,
he'll be on foot.

01:41:38.426 --> 01:41:40.761
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.

01:41:40.845 --> 01:41:43.346
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.

01:41:43.473 --> 01:41:45.807
You can count on me.

01:41:47.477 --> 01:41:49.686
I know I can.

01:42:45.409 --> 01:42:47.536
They've left
to hit the village.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.496
No.

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:52.040
We'd have heard shots.

01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:56.586
They've gone.

01:43:29.787 --> 01:43:31.955
Good evening.

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:56.479
You'll be dead. All of you!

01:43:57.315 --> 01:43:58.815
Like that!

01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:01.318
If that's what you want.

01:44:01.444 --> 01:44:03.820
Do we have a choice?

01:44:06.616 --> 01:44:07.073
Of course.

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:08.909
Of course.

01:44:08.993 --> 01:44:10.911
Sit down.

01:44:10.995 --> 01:44:13.121
Let's talk.

01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:18.752
Things are turned around now?

01:44:18.836 --> 01:44:21.755
You're wondering how.

01:44:21.839 --> 01:44:25.091
Your friends, they don't
like you very much any more.

01:44:25.176 --> 01:44:27.844
You force them to make
too many decisions.

01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:30.513
With me... only one decision.

01:44:30.598 --> 01:44:32.682
Do what I say.

01:44:32.808 --> 01:44:35.101
You should not be surprised.

01:44:35.186 --> 01:44:39.689
My good friend Sotero, he
arranged to let me come in.

01:44:40.441 --> 01:44:42.525
Understand?

01:44:45.655 --> 01:44:48.031
Well, anyway...

01:44:48.157 --> 01:44:50.700
to business!

01:44:50.826 --> 01:44:53.620
I could kill you all.
You agree?

01:45:05.049 --> 01:45:07.467
Well... you don't disagree.

01:45:08.844 --> 01:45:11.888
Anyway, I don't
want to kill you.

01:45:11.973 --> 01:45:13.556
Why so generous?

01:45:14.684 --> 01:45:17.811
Practical. They hear
about it up north.

01:45:17.895 --> 01:45:21.064
Maybe some friends of yours
make more trouble for me.

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:24.067
A man who never
wants no trouble.

01:45:25.236 --> 01:45:27.821
We have a saying here.

01:45:27.905 --> 01:45:32.242
A thief who steals from a thief
is pardoned for 100 years.

01:45:32.326 --> 01:45:33.326
All right,
what does that leave?

01:45:33.411 --> 01:45:36.413
Only one thing. I pardon you.

01:45:37.915 --> 01:45:39.833
Ride on.

01:45:39.917 --> 01:45:41.084
Just like that?

01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:43.420
Mm, just like...

01:45:43.504 --> 01:45:47.757
I'll make it easy
for you. You want food?

01:45:47.883 --> 01:45:49.592
Give them food.

01:45:49.677 --> 01:45:52.178
Water? All right. Water.

01:45:52.263 --> 01:45:55.265
Horses? Saddled and waiting.

01:45:55.349 --> 01:45:57.434
Guns?

01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:02.897
The guns... the gun belts,
you take off and put here now.

01:46:09.238 --> 01:46:11.948
What about these people?

01:46:12.033 --> 01:46:17.120
What happens to these people will
happen whether I kill you first or not.

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.130
Just a little gesture?

01:46:28.257 --> 01:46:31.968
To show these people
who the real boss is.

01:46:32.053 --> 01:46:35.138
You go, then I give
you the guns back.

01:46:36.098 --> 01:46:38.975
I know you won't use
those guns against me.

01:46:39.101 --> 01:46:42.479
Only a crazy man makes
the same mistake twice.

01:47:10.341 --> 01:47:15.929
I don't understand why a man like you
took the job in the first place. Hm? Why?

01:47:16.013 --> 01:47:17.597
I wonder myself.

01:47:17.681 --> 01:47:20.600
No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.

01:47:20.684 --> 01:47:24.437
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his
clothes off and jumped on a cactus.

01:47:24.522 --> 01:47:26.773
I asked him
the same question: why?

01:47:27.525 --> 01:47:28.942
And?

01:47:29.026 --> 01:47:33.029
He said "It seemed to be a
good idea at the time."

01:48:11.485 --> 01:48:13.570
Good!

01:48:14.405 --> 01:48:16.156
Right.

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:20.493
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.

01:48:20.578 --> 01:48:23.246
Your friends in there owe
you at least that much.

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:27.041
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.

01:48:42.057 --> 01:48:45.351
You know, the first time I
took a job as a hired gun...

01:48:45.436 --> 01:48:49.272
a fella told me "Vin, you
can't afford to care."

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:51.774
There's your problem.

01:48:51.859 --> 01:48:54.777
One thing I don't need is
somebody telling me my problem.

01:48:54.904 --> 01:48:57.363
Like I said before,
that's your problem.

01:48:57.448 --> 01:49:01.451
You got involved in this
village and the people in it.

01:49:02.745 --> 01:49:06.289
Do you ever get tired of
hearing yourself talk?

01:49:06.415 --> 01:49:10.543
The reason I understand
your problem so well...

01:49:10.628 --> 01:49:13.796
is that I walked into
the same trap myself.

01:49:14.715 --> 01:49:16.299
Yeah.

01:49:16.425 --> 01:49:19.802
The first day we got here,
I started thinking...

01:49:19.929 --> 01:49:24.057
maybe I could put my gun away and
settle down and get a little land...

01:49:24.141 --> 01:49:25.808
raise some cattle.

01:49:25.935 --> 01:49:30.647
The things that these people know
about me wouldn't work against me.

01:49:30.731 --> 01:49:35.777
I... just didn't want you to think
you were the only sucker in town.

01:49:54.004 --> 01:49:55.463
Can we go with you, Bernardo?

01:49:55.547 --> 01:49:56.673
No.

01:49:56.757 --> 01:49:58.258
You like us, don't you?

01:49:58.342 --> 01:49:59.592
I guess so.

01:49:59.677 --> 01:50:01.928
You're one of us, aren't you?

01:50:02.012 --> 01:50:03.429
Yeah, I'm one of us all right.

01:50:03.514 --> 01:50:04.931
Take us with you! Please?!

01:50:05.015 --> 01:50:06.015
No!

01:50:06.141 --> 01:50:10.478
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.

01:50:15.442 --> 01:50:17.527
Don't ever say that again
about your fathers.

01:50:17.695 --> 01:50:19.529
They are not cowards!

01:50:22.199 --> 01:50:24.784
You think I am brave
because I carry a gun.

01:50:24.868 --> 01:50:28.705
Your fathers are much braver
because they carry responsibility.

01:50:28.831 --> 01:50:31.624
For you, your brothers,
your sisters and your mothers.

01:50:31.709 --> 01:50:35.378
This responsibility is like a
big rock that weighs a ton.

01:50:35.504 --> 01:50:39.799
It bends and it twists them until finally
it buries them under the ground.

01:50:39.883 --> 01:50:41.426
Nobody says they have to do it.

01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:44.220
They do it because they
love you and they want to.

01:50:46.015 --> 01:50:49.559
I have never had
this kind of courage.

01:50:50.728 --> 01:50:52.645
Running a farm...

01:50:52.730 --> 01:50:56.524
working like a mule, with no
guarantee what will become of it...

01:50:56.608 --> 01:50:58.234
this is bravery.

01:51:00.571 --> 01:51:03.489
That's why I never even
started anything like that.

01:51:03.574 --> 01:51:05.700
That's why I never will.

01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:23.843
You'll do much better on the
other side of the border.

01:51:23.927 --> 01:51:27.096
There you can steal
cattle, hold up trains.

01:51:27.222 --> 01:51:31.184
All you have to face is
a sheriff, a marshal.

01:51:31.268 --> 01:51:33.603
Once I rob a bank in Texas.

01:51:33.729 --> 01:51:37.273
Your government got after me
with a whole army. A whole army!

01:51:37.441 --> 01:51:40.943
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?

01:51:41.278 --> 01:51:44.447
In Texas, only Texans
can rob banks!

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:54.540
Â¡Adios!

01:52:40.337 --> 01:52:42.338
Â¡Adios!

01:52:51.473 --> 01:52:54.434
I could have told you
they'd sell us out.

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.826
Farmers...

01:53:12.369 --> 01:53:13.619
Farmers!

01:53:13.704 --> 01:53:16.539
No honor, no loyalty...nothin'.

01:53:18.125 --> 01:53:23.212
All they care about is their precious
crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.

01:53:25.716 --> 01:53:27.967
I hate 'em.

01:53:29.219 --> 01:53:30.761
I hate 'em all.

01:53:30.846 --> 01:53:32.472
Sure you hate them.

01:53:34.558 --> 01:53:38.060
Because you come from a
village just like that one.

01:53:38.187 --> 01:53:40.521
You yourself are a farmer.

01:53:43.025 --> 01:53:45.067
Yes.

01:53:45.486 --> 01:53:47.737
Yes, I'm one of them.

01:53:49.072 --> 01:53:51.866
But who made us
the way we are? Hm?

01:53:52.576 --> 01:53:54.869
Men with guns.

01:53:55.662 --> 01:53:58.664
Men like Calvera and...

01:53:59.166 --> 01:54:01.375
men like you.

01:54:02.419 --> 01:54:04.921
And now me.

01:54:08.258 --> 01:54:10.760
So what d'you expect us to be?

01:54:17.726 --> 01:54:21.020
Nobody throws me my own
guns and says run. Nobody.

01:54:22.105 --> 01:54:26.526
It took me a long, long time to
learn my elbow from a hot rock.

01:54:27.528 --> 01:54:32.240
Right now, I belong back in that
border town, sleepin' on white sheets.

01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:38.538
I think I'll ride back
to that village.

01:54:39.248 --> 01:54:44.460
You're crazy, all of ya! They won't lift
a finger to help. Think of the odds.

01:54:45.754 --> 01:54:48.881
Harry... nobody's
asking you to go back.

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:52.885
Ride on, Harry. It's all right.

01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:55.638
Bet your sweet life, I will!

01:55:01.812 --> 01:55:04.814
Come on, Lee. They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.

01:55:04.898 --> 01:55:08.985
Go ahead, Lee. You don't
owe anything to anybody.

01:55:10.487 --> 01:55:11.612
Except to myself.

01:55:11.613 --> 01:55:12.822
Except to myself.

01:55:25.961 --> 01:55:28.254
You're crazy! All of ya!

01:55:28.338 --> 01:55:30.756
Come on. Ya!

01:58:12.002 --> 01:58:14.170
Hold on, Chris,
I'll get ya outta there!

01:58:54.127 --> 01:58:55.294
Chris...

01:58:55.378 --> 01:58:56.712
Yes, Harry?

01:58:56.797 --> 01:58:58.881
I'd hate to die a sucker.

01:58:58.965 --> 01:59:02.885
We didn't come here just to keep an eye
on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:05.888
There was something else
all the time, wasn't there?

01:59:06.014 --> 01:59:09.809
Yes, Harry. You had it
pegged right all along.

01:59:09.893 --> 01:59:11.644
I knew it.

01:59:11.728 --> 01:59:13.813
What was it?

01:59:13.897 --> 01:59:15.898
Gold.

01:59:15.982 --> 01:59:17.191
Sacks of it.

01:59:17.275 --> 01:59:20.361
Oh... sounds beautiful!

01:59:21.071 --> 01:59:22.404
How much?

01:59:22.489 --> 01:59:24.740
At least a half a million.

01:59:24.866 --> 01:59:26.492
My cut woulda been what?

01:59:26.576 --> 01:59:28.744
About 70,000.

01:59:29.871 --> 01:59:31.330
I'll be damned!

01:59:40.757 --> 01:59:41.882
Maybe you won't be.

02:02:16.496 --> 02:02:18.998
You came back.

02:02:19.082 --> 02:02:21.583
For a place like this.

02:02:22.210 --> 02:02:24.253
Why?

02:02:24.504 --> 02:02:26.422
A man like you?!

02:02:27.757 --> 02:02:29.842
Why?

02:03:03.877 --> 02:03:06.003
Bernardo! Bernardo!

02:03:06.087 --> 02:03:08.130
No. No, get back.
Go on! Get back.

02:03:19.476 --> 02:03:21.977
We didn't... We
didn't mean to do it.

02:03:22.062 --> 02:03:24.438
We didn't mean to do it.

02:03:29.069 --> 02:03:31.403
You see?

02:03:31.488 --> 02:03:34.823
I told you.
You see your fathers?

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.085
What's my name?

02:03:46.169 --> 02:03:47.461
Bernardo.

02:03:47.545 --> 02:03:49.338
Bernardo!

02:03:50.924 --> 02:03:53.342
You're damn right.

02:04:43.017 --> 02:04:45.310
You could stay, you know.

02:04:45.395 --> 02:04:48.397
They wouldn't be sorry
to have you stay.

02:04:48.982 --> 02:04:50.816
They won't be sorry
to see us go, either.

02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:54.319
Yes. The fighting is over.

02:04:54.404 --> 02:04:56.488
Your work is done.

02:04:56.573 --> 02:04:59.408
For them, each season
has its tasks.

02:05:00.994 --> 02:05:05.080
If there were a season for
gratitude, they'd show it more.

02:05:06.207 --> 02:05:10.085
We didn't get any more
than we expected, old man.

02:05:11.087 --> 02:05:13.505
Only the farmers have won.

02:05:14.549 --> 02:05:17.009
They remain forever.

02:05:17.093 --> 02:05:19.845
They are like the land itself.

02:05:21.055 --> 02:05:23.682
You helped to rid
them of Calvera...

02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:27.769
the way a strong wind
helps rid them of locusts.

02:05:29.606 --> 02:05:31.857
You are like the wind...

02:05:32.108 --> 02:05:35.736
blowing over the land
and passing on.

02:05:39.949 --> 02:05:42.284
God be with you.

02:05:44.454 --> 02:05:47.122
Adios.

02:06:29.457 --> 02:06:31.500
Adios.

02:06:37.507 --> 02:06:38.840
Adios.

02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.625
The old man was right.

02:07:13.710 --> 02:07:15.877
Only the farmers won.

02:07:15.962 --> 02:07:18.046
We lost.

02:07:18.715 --> 02:07:21.049
We always lose.
