00:02.110 --> 00:04.476
The life expectancy now is 72,
I think, for men.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.446
Seventy-five or six
or something for women.

00:08.616 --> 00:11.141
It's amazing to think that
a couple thousand years ago...

00:11.319 --> 00:13.150
...life expectancy was 30.

00:13.321 --> 00:17.451
Which, in our terms, would mean you
get your driver's license around 5...

00:17.625 --> 00:20.651
...you'd marry at 9, divorced at 15.

00:20.828 --> 00:23.729
In your late teens,
you move down to Florida.

00:23.898 --> 00:27.061
I guess that's how spring break
got started. I don't know.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.396
And eventually people
say things about you, like:

00:29.571 --> 00:32.165
"Well, it's amazing, he's 28,
but he's still very alert.

00:32.340 --> 00:35.707
His mind is so sharp, you would think
you're talking to a 2-year-old."

00:41.849 --> 00:44.079
What's the point?

00:44.485 --> 00:50.355
When I like them, they don't like me.
When they like me, I don't like them.

00:51.292 --> 00:54.022
Why can't I act with ones I like
the way I do with ones I don't?

00:54.195 --> 00:58.689
Well, you've only got another 50 years
or so to go and it'll all be over.

01:01.302 --> 01:04.635
Maybe I need someone
who doesn't speak English.

01:04.973 --> 01:07.032
Yeah, how about a mute?

01:08.176 --> 01:10.041
A mute would be good.

01:10.745 --> 01:12.713
Where you gonna meet a mute?

01:12.880 --> 01:16.111
This is what my life has come to:
Trying to meet a mute.

01:17.151 --> 01:19.813
I don't know, Jerry,
Something's missing.

01:19.988 --> 01:23.685
There's a void, Jerry.
There's a void.

01:23.858 --> 01:26.725
A deep, yawning chasm.

01:27.495 --> 01:30.191
Well, there's gotta be more to life
than this.

01:30.365 --> 01:32.799
What gives you pleasure?

01:32.967 --> 01:34.832
Listening to you.

01:35.003 --> 01:37.528
I listen to this for 15 minutes,
I'm on top of the world.

01:37.705 --> 01:40.071
Your misery is my pleasure.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.500
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, how you doing?

01:42.677 --> 01:46.511
Good. Okay. Well, it's all set.
I start tomorrow.

01:46.681 --> 01:49.241
- Start what?
- I signed up to do volunteer work...

01:49.417 --> 01:51.510
...with senior citizens.
- Really?

01:51.686 --> 01:54.382
Yeah. God. I can't tell you how I feel.

01:54.555 --> 01:58.252
I mean, I feel so good.
I really feel good.

01:58.426 --> 02:01.224
The strange thing is, I mean,
I haven't even met the woman yet.

02:01.396 --> 02:03.921
- Volunteer work?
- What are you gonna do down there?

02:04.098 --> 02:06.692
They say all it is is you go
over to their apartment and...

02:06.868 --> 02:09.666
...you take them out for a walk
and you get a cup of coffee...

02:09.836 --> 02:12.067
...and it's supposed
to make them feel good.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.435
That's what I do with him.

02:16.577 --> 02:18.408
Wait. When did you get this idea?

02:18.579 --> 02:20.342
Last time I had lunch with you here.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.507
You were going on and on and on
about how you wanna...

02:23.685 --> 02:25.880
...meet somebody
who didn't speak English.

02:27.355 --> 02:30.552
What, do you break it in with her
then you try it out on me?

02:31.726 --> 02:34.559
- And anybody could do this?
- Yeah.

02:34.729 --> 02:36.287
Really?

02:36.464 --> 02:38.398
Helping people.

02:38.966 --> 02:40.797
Of course.

02:40.968 --> 02:42.458
Of course.

02:42.637 --> 02:44.901
It makes perfect sense.

02:45.073 --> 02:47.337
How could I not be doing this?

02:47.508 --> 02:50.807
- I am gonna help somebody, damn it.
- What about you?

02:50.978 --> 02:52.240
No, it's not for me.

02:52.413 --> 02:54.711
Jerry, if anybody should
be doing this, it's you.

02:54.882 --> 02:57.715
What kind of a person are you?

02:58.052 --> 03:00.043
I think I'm pretty much like you.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.712
Only successful.

03:08.763 --> 03:10.924
This is a wonderful thing.
They're so grateful...

03:11.099 --> 03:12.566
...to have someone to talk to.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.032
And I can tell you
that everyone who participates...

03:15.203 --> 03:17.171
...finds the experience
extremely rewarding.

03:17.338 --> 03:19.101
Well, I feel better already.

03:19.273 --> 03:21.571
I mean, I'm feeling like
a good person.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.037
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

03:24.545 --> 03:26.308
Thank you.

03:26.914 --> 03:28.779
Hey, hey, what's your guy's
name again?

03:28.950 --> 03:31.009
Fields. Sidney Fields.

03:31.185 --> 03:34.484
Eighty-seven years old.
Eighty-seven.

03:34.655 --> 03:39.422
- How about your guy?
- Ben Cantwell, 85.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.255
You think we'll make it to that age?

03:41.429 --> 03:43.090
We? No.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:50.905 --> 03:53.135
So, what's up, diggety-dog?

03:53.307 --> 03:56.401
George and I just signed up with
the senior citizens volunteer agency.

03:56.577 --> 03:57.874
Same thing Elaine's doing.

03:58.045 --> 03:59.444
Oh, that's too bad.

04:00.314 --> 04:01.872
Don't say I didn't try to warn you.

04:02.049 --> 04:06.008
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, Jerry, I'm surprised at you.

04:06.187 --> 04:08.052
- What?
- It's a con.

04:08.222 --> 04:12.352
These agencies are usually a front
for some money-laundering scheme.

04:12.527 --> 04:13.926
Or they're bunco artists.

04:14.095 --> 04:17.791
Bilking people out of their life savings.
Oh, yeah.

04:18.933 --> 04:21.868
- Where do you get this?
- The alternative media, Jerry.

04:22.036 --> 04:24.129
That's where you hear the truth.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.671
Kramer? Kramer?

04:26.841 --> 04:31.244
Kramer! Where are you? Kramer!

04:31.412 --> 04:33.972
Come on, I'm in here. Come on.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.044
- There you are.
- Yeah.

04:36.217 --> 04:38.811
Hello, Newman.

04:40.321 --> 04:43.586
Jerry. George. So did you ask him
about the records?

04:43.758 --> 04:45.020
- Well...
- What records?

04:45.193 --> 04:50.563
Newman and I are going partners,
selling used records.

04:57.405 --> 04:59.134
You know Ron's Records
down on Bleecker?

04:59.307 --> 05:00.865
They pay big cash for used records.

05:01.042 --> 05:02.976
So we thought if you had any
of those big...

05:03.144 --> 05:05.908
...old-fashioned useless records
just lying around, you know...

05:06.080 --> 05:07.775
We'd take them off your hands. Free.

05:07.949 --> 05:10.918
Let me ask you something.
What do you do for a living, Newman?

05:11.085 --> 05:13.645
I'm a United States postal worker.

05:14.755 --> 05:16.746
Aren't those the guys
that always go crazy...

05:16.924 --> 05:19.119
...and come back with a gun
and shoot everybody?

05:19.827 --> 05:22.022
Sometimes.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.096
- Why is that?
- Because the mail never stops.

05:27.268 --> 05:29.395
It just keeps coming and coming
and coming.

05:29.570 --> 05:31.037
Never a letup. It's relentless.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.003
Every day it piles up more and more
and you gotta get it out...

05:34.175 --> 05:35.665
...but more keeps coming in!

05:35.843 --> 05:38.971
Then the bar code reader breaks,
and it's Publishers Clearing House day!

05:39.146 --> 05:40.773
All right, all right, all right.

05:40.948 --> 05:43.473
Just take the records.
They're in the bedroom. Take them.

05:43.651 --> 05:46.211
- Take anything you want.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:50.591 --> 05:52.525
I'll give you 5 bucks.

05:53.127 --> 05:54.526
- Five bucks?
- Five bucks?

05:54.695 --> 05:58.597
- Do you know what those are worth?
- Yeah, I do. Five dollars.

05:58.766 --> 06:00.893
Those records are worth more
than 5 dollars.

06:01.068 --> 06:03.002
- He's gypping us.
- You're gypping us.

06:03.170 --> 06:06.401
Well, what do you got? You know,
you got Don Ho Live In Honolulu.

06:06.574 --> 06:09.634
You got Jerry Vale
Sings Italian Love Songs.

06:09.810 --> 06:12.005
And you got Sergio Mendes.
Now, come on!

06:12.179 --> 06:14.511
Wait, wait, wait. Sergio Mendes
has a cult following.

06:14.682 --> 06:16.149
Why, they follow him like a cult.

06:16.317 --> 06:18.285
Can't walk down the street
in South America.

06:18.452 --> 06:22.388
Look, that's his problem, all right?
Now, you don't like it? Too bad.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.922
- I don't like it.
- I don't like it.

06:25.092 --> 06:26.719
Then get out of my store, all right?

06:26.894 --> 06:29.954
You bring me something decent,
I'll give you some money.

06:30.131 --> 06:32.326
- All right, we'll be back, Jack.
- All right.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.365
- Come on.
- We'll be back...

06:34.535 --> 06:35.797
...Jack.

06:43.044 --> 06:45.342
Hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
The agency sent me.

06:45.513 --> 06:49.040
- Agency?
- Yeah. Is this Sid Fields' residence?

06:49.216 --> 06:52.617
- Sid Fields?
- What the hell is it?

06:52.787 --> 06:54.220
- Mr. Fields?
- What?

06:54.388 --> 06:56.754
Hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
The agency sent me.

06:56.924 --> 07:01.258
The agency? What agency?
The CIA?

07:01.996 --> 07:04.055
- No, no, the senior...
- Who let you in here?

07:04.231 --> 07:06.392
- The woman.
- Oh, her.

07:06.567 --> 07:11.766
She steals from me. Steals my money.
She says she doesn't speak English.

07:11.939 --> 07:14.499
My ass, she doesn't speak English.

07:14.675 --> 07:18.372
Plays that freaking voodoo music.

07:18.546 --> 07:21.481
Tries to hypnotize me.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.913
She thinks she's gonna turn me
into a zombie...

07:24.085 --> 07:25.712
...and then rob me blind.

07:26.587 --> 07:28.521
Well, I wasn't born yesterday.

07:28.689 --> 07:32.682
I might drop dead today, but I
sure as hell wasn't born yesterday.

07:32.860 --> 07:34.885
Now, get the hell out of my house.

07:35.963 --> 07:38.523
But, Mr. Fields, I'm here
to spend some time with you.

07:38.699 --> 07:40.690
Oh, really?

07:40.868 --> 07:44.360
Are you the boyfriend?
I know she's got a boyfriend.

07:44.538 --> 07:48.167
Are you gonna kill me?
I'm an old man, for crying out loud.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.435
You gonna kill an old man,
you coward?

07:50.611 --> 07:53.011
No, Mr. Fields. Look. Really. I'm...
Here's my ident...

07:53.180 --> 07:56.240
I can't read that, you fool.

07:56.417 --> 07:59.477
- Well, what's all this stuff?
- Trash. Garbage.

08:00.688 --> 08:01.848
You're throwing this out?

08:02.023 --> 08:06.016
I believe that's what you do
with garbage, you idiot.

08:08.129 --> 08:09.687
Really? You don't want any of this?

08:09.864 --> 08:15.734
Well, if I wanted it, I wouldn't be
throwing it away, would I, Einstein?

08:15.903 --> 08:18.371
I have friends that would really love
to have these.

08:18.539 --> 08:22.873
Well, take it. I sure as hell am not
gonna give it to my family.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.945
Well, do you wanna go out and go
for a walk, get a cup of coffee?

08:26.113 --> 08:27.239
With you?

08:27.415 --> 08:29.474
I'd rather be dead.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.375
Well, maybe I'll get going, then.

08:33.254 --> 08:36.280
I just remembered I got
an appointment to get my tonsils out.

08:36.457 --> 08:39.585
Good. Thank God. Good riddance.

08:39.927 --> 08:42.554
Oh, listen, before you go...

08:42.730 --> 08:45.255
...would you mind
changing my diaper?

08:51.806 --> 08:54.570
Oh, I feel great for 85.

08:54.742 --> 09:00.203
You know, the average life span
for an American male is, like, 72.

09:01.215 --> 09:02.773
You're really...

09:02.950 --> 09:05.612
...kind of pushing
the envelope there.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.618
I'm not afraid to die,
and I never think about it.

09:10.891 --> 09:12.324
You don't?

09:12.493 --> 09:14.825
Boy, I think about it a lot.

09:14.995 --> 09:16.462
I think about it at my age.

09:16.630 --> 09:19.497
Imagine how much
I'll be thinking about it at your age.

09:19.667 --> 09:22.636
All I'll do is keep thinking about it
till it drives me insane.

09:22.803 --> 09:25.271
I'm grateful for
every moment I have.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.373
Grateful?

09:27.541 --> 09:31.568
How can you be grateful
when you're so close to the end?

09:31.745 --> 09:33.940
When you know that any second:

09:34.381 --> 09:37.043
It could all be over.
I mean, you're not stupid.

09:37.218 --> 09:39.448
You can read the handwriting
on the wall.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.384
It's a matter of simple arithmetic,
for God's sake.

09:43.357 --> 09:45.222
I guess I just don't care.

09:45.392 --> 09:47.656
What are you talking about?

09:47.828 --> 09:49.887
How can you sit there
and look me in the eye...

09:50.064 --> 09:53.295
...and tell me that you're not worried?
Don't you have any sense?

09:53.467 --> 09:54.729
Don't you have a brain?

09:54.902 --> 09:57.166
Are you so completely senile
you don't even know...

09:57.338 --> 09:59.169
...what you're talking about
anymore?

09:59.340 --> 10:01.467
Wait a second.
Where are you going?

10:01.642 --> 10:04.372
Life's too short to waste on you.

10:04.545 --> 10:08.447
- Whoa, whoa, please.
- Get out of my way.

10:09.717 --> 10:13.414
But, Mr. Cantwell,
you owe me for the soup.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:24.899 --> 10:28.164
- Mrs. Oliver?
- Yes, my dear?

10:33.941 --> 10:37.638
- What's the trouble? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.473
Yeah... Yes. Yeah.

10:41.315 --> 10:44.409
It's my goiter, isn't it?

10:45.252 --> 10:49.518
Did you say goiter? What goiter?

10:50.357 --> 10:55.226
This football-shaped lump
jutting out the side of my neck.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.968
That goiter.

11:02.670 --> 11:04.695
Hey.

11:08.909 --> 11:11.139
What do you know?

11:12.446 --> 11:14.380
Does it bother you?

11:14.548 --> 11:17.039
Bother me?

11:17.218 --> 11:19.812
Why would a little goiter like that
bother me?

11:19.987 --> 11:24.048
No. Not a bit. It's nothing.
It's nothing. It's...

11:24.225 --> 11:27.820
In fact, it's very distinctive.
You know?

11:27.995 --> 11:30.623
I mean, you wanna
know something?

11:30.798 --> 11:33.323
I wish I had one.

11:35.536 --> 11:37.026
Really.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.466
Come on, Elaine, it's just a goiter.

11:42.643 --> 11:46.511
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I can't look the woman in the face.

11:47.414 --> 11:51.248
I mean, I keep thinking that goiter's
gonna start talking to me.

11:53.487 --> 11:56.581
You'd think that they'd mention that
before they sent you over there.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.853
"Oh, by the way, this woman
almost has a second head."

12:02.329 --> 12:05.696
But no, no.
I didn't get any goiter information.

12:05.866 --> 12:10.530
They really should mention that in the
breakdown. Height. Weight. Goiter.

12:10.704 --> 12:12.433
You know, you try to do some good.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.803
You wanna be a good person,
but this is too much to ask.

12:15.976 --> 12:18.638
Well, I'd rather talk to a goiter
with a nice disposition...

12:18.812 --> 12:21.212
...than the nut they sent me to.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.679
Georgie, what happened
with your guy?

12:25.252 --> 12:27.777
I don't think it's gonna work out.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.519
- What do you mean?
- He fired me.

12:32.159 --> 12:33.592
He fired you?

12:33.761 --> 12:36.855
How do you get fired
from a volunteer job?

12:37.598 --> 12:42.467
I don't know. I was just talking
to the man, and he walked out on me.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.900
Well, I don't know about you two,
but I'm quitting.

12:45.072 --> 12:46.937
I hate my guy.

12:47.107 --> 12:49.667
He's a mean, mean guy.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.476
- I wish I could quit.
- So quit.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.807
Yeah, I'm a great quitter.

12:55.516 --> 12:57.507
It's one of the few things I do well.

12:57.685 --> 13:00.119
I come from a long line of quitters.

13:00.287 --> 13:03.347
My father was a quitter.
My grandfather was a quitter.

13:03.524 --> 13:06.015
I was raised to give up.

13:07.928 --> 13:09.418
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:09.596 --> 13:11.655
Well, here's your albums.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.595
- What happened?
- Five dollars.

13:13.767 --> 13:17.066
- He offered us 5 dollars.
- What kind of stuff you listening to?

13:17.237 --> 13:19.262
You embarrassed me at that store.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.000
That guy thought we were
a couple of total squares.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.201
Oh, yeah,
you and your Sergio Mendes.

13:24.378 --> 13:27.711
Hey, that guy can't even go
to the bathroom in South America.

13:27.881 --> 13:29.405
You should have seen the albums...

13:29.583 --> 13:32.017
...this old guy I was visiting today
was throwing away.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.553
Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson,
Benny Goodman.

13:35.723 --> 13:38.817
- Wait, he's throwing them out?
- I asked if my friends could have them.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.584
- He said, "Yeah."
- The coot's sitting...

13:40.761 --> 13:42.524
...on a mountain of gold.
- Yeah.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.596
You have to get them.
I'm not carrying them.

13:44.765 --> 13:47.199
- But you're gonna come.
- Yeah. I'm going there today.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.393
In fact, you should see
this housekeeper.

13:49.570 --> 13:51.231
She's from Senegal.

13:51.405 --> 13:54.135
Wild, wild stuff.

13:54.308 --> 13:55.639
Senegal?

13:58.312 --> 14:01.713
So you don't speak
any English at all?

14:03.150 --> 14:05.880
- English? No.
- No.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.044
Hey, what are those bums
doing back there?

14:08.222 --> 14:10.281
You said they could come
and take the records.

14:10.457 --> 14:14.757
It's like watching a couple of hyenas
going through the garbage.

14:14.928 --> 14:18.830
- You don't speak any English?
- No English.

14:20.801 --> 14:25.829
I would like to dip my bald head in oil
and rub it all over your body.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.672
You don't understand.

14:31.278 --> 14:32.802
It's a miracle.

14:32.980 --> 14:36.939
You don't understand
because you don't speak English.

14:37.117 --> 14:39.051
So I just don't know
if this arrangement...

14:39.219 --> 14:42.086
Hey. Hey. I don't like
what's going on around here.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.451
- I want all of you bums out of here.
- Calm down...

14:44.625 --> 14:46.286
- Don't tell me to calm down.
- Please...

14:46.460 --> 14:48.360
- Get your hands off me.
- Cool it, pops.

14:48.529 --> 14:50.759
- Why, you little...
- Wait, wait, Mr. Fields.

14:52.366 --> 14:54.027
He's biting me!

14:55.302 --> 14:57.327
My teeth. My teeth!

14:57.504 --> 14:59.301
Where's his teeth?
Where's his teeth?

14:59.473 --> 15:00.906
I saw something fly over here.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.133
Well, turn the light on.

15:03.844 --> 15:06.108
That's the garbage disposal.

15:09.116 --> 15:12.176
My teeth. You idiots.

15:12.352 --> 15:15.116
Well, we'll take you to your dentist.
Where's your dentist?

15:15.289 --> 15:16.517
- Downtown.
- All right.

15:16.690 --> 15:19.591
George, Kramer, look after Mr. Fields.
I'll go get the cab.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.990
Bunch of morons.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.662
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where's the old man?

15:30.170 --> 15:32.035
I thought George
was keeping an eye on him.

15:32.206 --> 15:34.640
- Me? I thought you were.
- Come on, we lost the old man.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.902
Let's go. Get out of the car.
Go. We've gotta find him.

15:38.078 --> 15:40.046
He can't have gotten far.

15:47.855 --> 15:51.621
And we would take
long automobile trips.

15:51.792 --> 15:54.625
- Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.
- Yes, and...

15:54.795 --> 15:57.855
...just staring out the window...

15:58.031 --> 16:04.231
...you'd see a long view
of rolling pastures and...

16:04.404 --> 16:09.706
- Get you going, right there.
...and very big Brahman cows and...

16:09.877 --> 16:13.142
- Oh, cows? Oh, that's...
- Yeah, that was when...

16:13.313 --> 16:17.340
...fascinating.
...I began my affair with Mohandas.

16:20.087 --> 16:23.113
- What?
- Mohandas.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.516
Gandhi?

16:28.695 --> 16:30.595
The passion.

16:34.668 --> 16:38.195
The forbidden pleasure.

16:39.573 --> 16:43.270
You had an affair with Gandhi?

16:44.211 --> 16:49.046
He used to dip his bald head in oil...

16:49.650 --> 16:55.350
...and he'd rub it all over my body.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.417
Here. Look.

16:59.459 --> 17:02.189
Oh, my God.

17:02.996 --> 17:05.430
The Mahatma?

17:06.366 --> 17:08.425
We're supposed to be looking
for the old man.

17:08.602 --> 17:09.590
Oh, we will. We will.

17:10.671 --> 17:12.229
Twenty bucks.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.601
Twenty bucks?
Are you out of your mind?

17:14.775 --> 17:19.007
- Take it or leave it.
- We got Al Jolson here. Al Jolson!

17:19.179 --> 17:21.545
Al Jolson. What the hell do I care
about Al Jolson?

17:21.714 --> 17:24.275
I'd just as soon hear
you sing "Mammy."

17:25.117 --> 17:27.415
This guy is nothing
but a piece of crap.

17:27.588 --> 17:31.115
You are nothing but a piece of crap.

17:31.291 --> 17:32.451
What did you call me?

17:32.626 --> 17:34.958
- A piece of crap.
- A piece of crap.

17:35.128 --> 17:39.428
- I find you extremely ugly.
- I find you extremely ugly.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.366
- Do you?
- You emit a foul and unpleasant odor.

17:43.537 --> 17:48.600
- You emit a foul and unpleasant odor.
- Oh, is that right?

17:48.775 --> 17:52.438
- I loathe you.
- I loathe you.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.205
That's it. Get out of my store.

17:54.381 --> 17:56.315
- Make us.
- Make us. Make us. Make us.

17:56.483 --> 18:00.214
- I'll make you.
- Wait a minute. Wait! Wait!

18:01.855 --> 18:03.755
Do you realize how irresponsible
this is?

18:03.924 --> 18:06.722
Our agency's sole purpose
is to care for senior citizens.

18:06.893 --> 18:09.020
And in one fell swoop
you have single-handedly...

18:09.196 --> 18:11.130
...destroyed our reputation.

18:11.765 --> 18:13.756
Yes, but...

18:14.668 --> 18:18.604
- Yes?
- It's Tim Fields. Mr. Fields' son.

18:18.772 --> 18:20.899
All right, come on up.

18:21.541 --> 18:22.769
Oh, great.

18:22.943 --> 18:25.878
I don't know what happened.
We tried to take him to the dentist.

18:26.046 --> 18:28.014
Why were you taking him
to the dentist?

18:29.116 --> 18:31.846
Well, his false teeth got mangled up
in the garbage disposal.

18:32.019 --> 18:34.351
What were his teeth doing
in the garbage disposal?

18:34.521 --> 18:36.853
- Well, after he bit my friend...
- Bit your friend?

18:38.291 --> 18:42.250
What the hell is going on here?
How do you lose a human being?

18:42.429 --> 18:44.659
- I am sorry.
- And who were these other people?

18:44.831 --> 18:46.526
What were they doing
in the apartment?

18:46.700 --> 18:49.999
Well, I brought them up there
to take his records.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.694
Take his records?

18:51.872 --> 18:54.864
Do you realize how valuable
that record collection is?

18:55.042 --> 18:56.805
- Hey!
- There you are. Did you find him?

18:56.977 --> 18:58.205
No.

18:58.378 --> 19:01.347
We took the records over to Ron's,
and he tried to screw us...

19:01.515 --> 19:03.506
...and then we got in a fight.
- A real melee.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.652
Yeah, a real brouhaha.

19:07.087 --> 19:11.547
- Then all the records broke.
- The records? My father's records?

19:11.725 --> 19:15.092
- Did anybody try and call him?
- Yeah, I called, but there's no answer.

19:15.262 --> 19:16.524
Well, the line's busy now.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.359
The line's busy. He must be home.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.346
We...

19:41.521 --> 19:43.785
We couldn't find him.

19:47.761 --> 19:49.991
What the hell's the point?

19:50.163 --> 19:52.063
When you like them,
they don't like you...

19:52.232 --> 19:55.065
...and when they like you,
you don't like them.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.302
Oh, you don't know what you want.

19:57.471 --> 19:59.166
You should see a psychiatrist.

19:59.339 --> 20:01.864
I got fixed up last week.

20:02.042 --> 20:04.101
I never would get fixed up.

20:04.277 --> 20:07.110
I go to pick her up,
and she opens the door...

20:07.280 --> 20:12.547
...and she's got this huge goiter
growing out of the side of her neck.

20:12.719 --> 20:15.244
Looked like a football.

20:15.789 --> 20:18.849
- What did you do?
- Well, we get to talking...

20:19.025 --> 20:22.688
...and as it turns out,
the woman knew Gandhi.

20:23.997 --> 20:25.965
We talked for hours.

20:26.133 --> 20:28.328
Well, are you gonna see her again?

20:28.502 --> 20:31.164
We were getting along real good...

20:31.338 --> 20:33.499
...and then she made some tea.

20:33.673 --> 20:36.267
Put some milk in it
without asking me.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.536
Now, that's a turnoff.

20:39.713 --> 20:40.941
You don't need that.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.411
The thing about old people...

20:42.582 --> 20:44.447
...is everything about them
gets smaller.

20:44.618 --> 20:48.213
You know, their bodies get smaller.
They move into smaller places.

20:48.388 --> 20:50.822
They sleep less time,
they eat smaller meals.

20:50.991 --> 20:53.983
Except the car. The older they get,
the bigger their car gets.

20:54.161 --> 20:55.856
I've never understood that.

20:56.029 --> 20:58.361
Old people have a way
of backing out of the driveway.

20:58.532 --> 21:00.591
Know what I mean?
They don't turn side to side.

21:00.767 --> 21:03.235
They just go, "I'm old.
I've been waiting a long time.

21:03.403 --> 21:06.600
I'm backing it out." You know?
"I'm coming back.

21:06.773 --> 21:09.901
Watch out. I'm coming," you know.
And you've gotta watch out for them.

21:10.076 --> 21:13.170
And then once they get out there
they drive so slowly.

21:13.346 --> 21:15.405
I would think the less time
you have in life...

21:15.582 --> 21:17.550
...the faster you would wanna go.

21:17.717 --> 21:20.242
I think old people should be allowed
to drive their age.

21:20.420 --> 21:22.388
If you're 80, do 80.

21:22.556 --> 21:24.319
If you're 100, go 100.

21:24.491 --> 21:28.587
They can't see where they're going
anyway, let them have fun out there.
