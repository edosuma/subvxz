I forgive you, William.

00:58.373 --> 01:01.040
I forgive you, William.

01:07.281 --> 01:09.348
I forgive you, William.

01:18.857 --> 01:21.026
I forgive you, William.

01:23.829 --> 01:26.464
I forgive you, William.

02:09.505 --> 02:11.406
Hello, Detective Murdoch.

02:11.284 --> 02:14.920
Remember me? I know what you're thinking:

02:14.954 --> 02:18.356
"Now I understand how
rats get caught in traps.

02:18.424 --> 02:20.358
They're easy to fool!"

02:20.426 --> 02:23.194
Welcome to the Murdoch Trap, Detective.

02:23.262 --> 02:28.432
We are going to have so much fun!

02:43.750 --> 02:47.486
Dr. Ogden, I have no recourse

02:47.521 --> 02:52.490
but to sentence you to be hanged
by the neck until you are dead.

02:54.427 --> 02:56.561
May God have mercy on your soul.

03:03.703 --> 03:05.170
Sirs?

03:05.205 --> 03:07.171
In here, Crabtree.

03:07.206 --> 03:09.606
Ah. Sorry I'm late, sirs.

03:09.641 --> 03:13.711
Chief Constable Giles has me on desk duty.
I had to wait until he left the station.

03:13.745 --> 03:16.113
Right, then, let's get on with it, Murdoch.

03:16.148 --> 03:18.782
So, are you sure it was Gillies
you saw in the courtroom?

03:21.220 --> 03:23.119
Yes, I'm sure it was him.

03:23.154 --> 03:25.722
Unfortunately, no one else saw him.

03:25.756 --> 03:28.558
And you think he's capable of this?

03:28.592 --> 03:30.626
We're talking about
James Gillies here, sir.

03:30.661 --> 03:32.628
The man has escaped the noose twice.

03:32.663 --> 03:36.733
- He's definitely capable of this.
- Well, we'll get him this time.

03:36.767 --> 03:39.735
And this time I'll be sure he hangs.

03:41.671 --> 03:43.472
Let's get started, shall we?

03:43.506 --> 03:45.707
Right. First we have the telephone call

03:45.742 --> 03:47.676
that the maid received.
She said she recognized

03:47.744 --> 03:50.913
- Dr. Ogden's voice.
- It's Dr. Ogden.

03:50.947 --> 03:54.283
Tell... Dr. Garland I will
come by at... six o'clock.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.885
She said her voice was halting.

03:56.919 --> 03:59.854
I suspect Gillies recorded
telephone conversations

03:59.922 --> 04:02.023
of Dr. Ogden's and then edited the results

04:02.091 --> 04:04.893
using multiple Edison
recorders and phonographs.

04:04.960 --> 04:08.729
He figured out a way to record
her telephone line at the asylum.

04:08.797 --> 04:11.531
- I'll look into that.
- Right, then,

04:11.599 --> 04:14.902
we have the witness who says she
saw Dr. Ogden walk into the house.

04:14.969 --> 04:18.939
Hello, Dr. Ogden.

04:18.973 --> 04:20.707
What cheek.

04:22.710 --> 04:25.045
That was Gillies,
wearing Dr. Ogden's dress.

04:25.113 --> 04:27.213
He's assumed a woman's
appearance in the past.

04:27.281 --> 04:30.783
Yes, but, sirs, Mrs. Smythe
said she saw Dr. Ogden's face.

04:30.850 --> 04:34.586
She saw what she thought was her face.
He could have altered his appearance.

04:34.654 --> 04:37.456
Using a mask, perhaps...

04:37.524 --> 04:39.458
something moulded to his face,

04:39.526 --> 04:42.994
possibly latex. He's capable of that.

04:43.062 --> 04:46.164
Well, then there's the blood
spatter on Dr. Ogden's dress.

04:48.700 --> 04:52.003
I believe Gillies was
wearing Dr. Ogden's dress

04:52.071 --> 04:54.005
when he shot Dr. Garland,

04:54.073 --> 04:56.341
and then discarded the dress
somewhere near her home,

04:56.375 --> 04:58.609
knowing it would be found.

04:58.677 --> 05:01.145
Sir, I'm not used to seeing
you drink tea in the evening.

05:01.179 --> 05:03.447
I'm not touching a drop of whisky

05:03.514 --> 05:05.449
until Dr. Ogden is exonerated.

05:05.483 --> 05:08.452
- A show of faith, Murdoch.
- That's very kind of you, sir.

05:08.519 --> 05:10.654
So you'd better catch him double-quick,

05:10.721 --> 05:12.825
because I'm sick and bloody tired
of drinking tea of an evening.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.615
Still,

05:14.759 --> 05:17.526
the thumbmark on the shell
casing is a real problem.

05:17.594 --> 05:19.528
Yes, I have a couple of
thoughts about that. George,

05:19.596 --> 05:21.464
I'll need you to get some
of my things from the office.

05:21.498 --> 05:24.633
Firstly, the elastic wax. And,
if you can manage it, George,

05:24.668 --> 05:26.869
I'll need the murder
weapon out of evidence.

05:26.937 --> 05:29.505
But only if you can manage it.

05:29.573 --> 05:31.506
The last thing we need
is another police officer

05:31.574 --> 05:34.176
working out of the inspector's dining room.

05:34.210 --> 05:36.644
Sir, I'll get it. No one will be the wiser.

05:39.582 --> 05:41.483
Yes, I've seen him before.

05:41.517 --> 05:43.485
He works with the telephone exchange.

05:43.552 --> 05:44.108
When was he here?

05:44.109 --> 05:47.021
Oh, a few weeks back. He
was here a couple of times.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.190
Did he work on Dr. Ogden's telephone?

05:49.257 --> 05:52.426
I didn't follow him around the
building, but he could have.

05:52.461 --> 05:56.197
- Now, if you will excuse me.
- Oh, of course, Doctor. Thank you.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.847
- Constable Crabtree!
- Oh! Sir!

06:15.882 --> 06:17.983
- Are you intending to leave?
- No, sir.

06:18.018 --> 06:20.552
- What are you doing, then?
- I was just bringing

06:20.586 --> 06:22.554
Detective Murdoch some
of his equipment, sir.

06:22.588 --> 06:26.325
I see nothing wrong with
that. Why so guilty, Crabtree?

06:26.359 --> 06:28.027
Well, just, I suppose

06:28.061 --> 06:30.728
this falls outside of the
scope of my regular duties, sir.

06:30.762 --> 06:33.964
Yes, well, consider
this your lunchtime then.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.533
Ah.

06:37.503 --> 06:40.104
- What's this for?
- That's silly rubber,

06:40.139 --> 06:42.640
sir. It's an invention of the detective's.

06:42.674 --> 06:45.742
Uh... yes.

06:45.776 --> 06:47.844
No doubt.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.455
Is that how he did it, then?

06:58.489 --> 07:02.358
Sir, I don't know if wax is
the best material for the mould,

07:02.426 --> 07:05.727
but I'm certain he used
latex rubber for the cast.

07:05.762 --> 07:08.897
- Any luck at the asylum?
- Oh, Gillies was there all right. Twice.

07:08.965 --> 07:10.933
Once to set up the recording device,

07:10.967 --> 07:13.902
- a second time to remove it.
- Bloody Gillies.

07:13.970 --> 07:16.572
Well, at least our
suspicions are confirmed.

07:18.541 --> 07:21.008
Sirs, I managed to bring the gun.

07:21.043 --> 07:23.632
No sooner did I get it than
Chief Constable Giles stopped me.

07:23.645 --> 07:25.846
Well, I just about laid an egg,

07:25.881 --> 07:29.084
but he was distracted then by
your, uh, silly rubber there.

07:29.151 --> 07:32.153
- Where shall I put this, sir?
- In the corner.

07:32.221 --> 07:37.857
Wait, wait, George. Did the
Chief Constable touch this?

07:37.892 --> 07:40.227
Yes, sir. He got his thumb
stuck in it. Look right there.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.399
George, I have another job for you.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.412
What are you doing?

07:59.446 --> 08:01.107
I'm trying to figure out how Gillies

08:01.108 --> 08:03.316
planted blood spatter on Dr. Ogden's dress.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.351
Well, he did it by wearing the
dress when he shot Dr. Garland.

08:06.419 --> 08:09.521
Then why were there no powder
burns on Dr. Garland's face?

08:09.589 --> 08:11.623
- From the gunshot?
- Yes.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.692
I never thought about it before,
but if Gillies was standing

08:14.727 --> 08:16.961
close enough to get blood
spatter on the dress...

08:17.029 --> 08:19.897
Then he should have been close
enough to get gunpowder residue

08:19.965 --> 08:21.898
onto Dr. Garland. Exactly.

08:21.933 --> 08:24.268
I see your point.

08:51.762 --> 08:54.829
You had to know, didn't you?

08:54.864 --> 08:56.931
That if you hadn't
check for her fingermarks

08:56.966 --> 08:59.668
on the cartridge she would have gone free.

08:59.735 --> 09:04.005
I knew you would, of course.
You're just so... curious.

09:04.073 --> 09:06.175
You must wonder:

09:06.209 --> 09:09.777
how does she feel, knowing it
was your doubt of her innocence

09:09.811 --> 09:11.879
that will see her hang?

09:16.785 --> 09:18.752
Gillies was behind all this?

09:18.787 --> 09:22.463
Yes, and I believe Gillies made
a latex mask resembling you.

09:22.690 --> 09:26.626
But to do this, he would've had to
have taken a plaster mould of your face.

09:26.661 --> 09:28.795
When would he have done that?

09:28.829 --> 09:31.565
I don't know, but I believe he did.

09:31.599 --> 09:34.867
Now, Julia, think back.
Can you recall anything...

09:34.902 --> 09:37.770
anything unusual?

09:39.707 --> 09:43.842
William, I never told you this...

09:43.876 --> 09:47.112
but about two months ago
I suffered a memory lapse.

09:47.146 --> 09:50.249
One moment I was sitting at
my desk, and the next moment

09:50.283 --> 09:55.554
I woke up on my couch. I just
thought I'd been working too hard.

09:55.622 --> 09:58.089
How much time had elapsed?

09:58.123 --> 10:01.226
Maybe one or two hours.

10:05.331 --> 10:07.765
Powder residue.

10:07.799 --> 10:11.569
- And that's two-and-a-half feet.
- May I shoot the next one?

10:11.604 --> 10:15.905
I don't know, Emily. That's
an official police ordinance.

10:15.940 --> 10:18.942
All right, just this once.

10:18.976 --> 10:21.010
So, this will be two feet.

10:25.015 --> 10:30.018
All right. Both feet planted firmly, and...

10:31.988 --> 10:33.689
Good shot.

10:35.659 --> 10:38.661
Dr. Grace, I think we've
just proven our case.

10:38.729 --> 10:42.097
What in blazes is going on?

10:42.165 --> 10:44.533
We are conducting an
experiment that will prove

10:44.601 --> 10:46.568
that Dr. Ogden was wrongfully convicted.

10:46.636 --> 10:50.905
- Indeed.
- Chief Constable, blood spatter travels three feet.

10:50.973 --> 10:53.180
Now, given that spatter was found 12 inches

10:53.181 --> 10:54.666
up the sleeve of the dress,

10:54.678 --> 10:57.979
we can surmiset hat the gun was
within two feet of our victim.

10:58.046 --> 11:01.215
A distance that should have
left visible gunpowder residue

11:01.283 --> 11:03.950
- on Dr. Garland's face.
- But there was none.

11:04.018 --> 11:07.655
How do you know how far
blood spatter travels?

11:07.689 --> 11:09.823
Detective Murdoch and I
conducted an experiment

11:09.891 --> 11:11.664
- on a previous case.
- On a human being?

11:11.665 --> 11:13.243
No, a pig.

11:13.628 --> 11:15.962
You shot a living pig?

11:16.030 --> 11:17.930
Dead, actually.

11:17.964 --> 11:20.266
And as a result of this, you've determined

11:20.334 --> 11:23.035
that the blood spatter
was artificially applied.

11:23.103 --> 11:27.373
Well, this was applied with
what, um, the flick of a brush?

11:27.441 --> 11:29.275
And this.

11:29.343 --> 11:31.076
It's rather uneven, isn't it?

11:31.111 --> 11:34.946
Multiple applications
with a perfume sprayer?

11:37.082 --> 11:40.919
This, on the other hand,
is real blood spatter

11:40.953 --> 11:42.695
from the explosive displacement

11:42.696 --> 11:45.900
following a bullet striking
well-vascularized flesh.

11:46.526 --> 11:50.160
There's no faking this.

11:50.228 --> 11:54.565
So whoever was wearing
this dress... shot somebody

11:54.599 --> 11:57.568
other than Dr. Garland.

11:57.636 --> 12:00.504
And who would that be?

12:07.277 --> 12:09.912
It's a matter of time before...

12:20.458 --> 12:23.425
There's always some emergency.

12:27.397 --> 12:30.632
It's a matter of... some... urgency.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.934
How is it going?

12:32.969 --> 12:35.904
George managed to record
seven minutes of conversation.

12:35.938 --> 12:38.205
- Will that be enough?
- It'll have to be.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.641
What do you want me to do
with this plaster of Paris?

12:40.676 --> 12:42.510
Put it on my face.

12:47.115 --> 12:50.351
I came as soon as I could.

12:50.386 --> 12:51.952
What's the problem?

12:51.987 --> 12:55.255
- Judge Matthews.
- Well, you just telephoned me.

12:55.289 --> 12:57.724
You said it was a matter of some urgency.

12:57.759 --> 13:00.193
I never telephoned you.

13:00.261 --> 13:02.143
W... we spoke. It was your voice.

13:02.144 --> 13:03.144
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:03.297 --> 13:04.323
I do.

13:05.302 --> 13:06.327
We've found another fingermark

13:06.328 --> 13:07.428
on the weapon that killed Dr. Garland.

13:07.602 --> 13:09.535
You're under suspension. You can't be here,

13:09.603 --> 13:11.570
- either of you.
- Chief Constable,

13:11.605 --> 13:14.807
have you had occasion to handle
this weapon with your bare hands?

13:14.841 --> 13:15.304
Of course not.

13:15.305 --> 13:17.914
Then how do you explain
your thumbmark on the gun?

13:22.816 --> 13:24.983
Oh, very resourceful, Detective.

13:25.018 --> 13:28.453
Will someone please apprise
me of what is going...

13:28.521 --> 13:32.123
Detective Murdoch has
demonstrated that someone

13:32.190 --> 13:35.159
could have fabricated some of
the evidence against Dr. Ogden...

13:35.193 --> 13:38.730
the telephone call, and the fingermark.

13:38.764 --> 13:41.098
However, he has yet to
demonstrate how it is

13:41.133 --> 13:44.301
- that someone saw her walk...
- Good God.

13:50.909 --> 13:54.445
Constable Crabtree, I presume?

14:02.085 --> 14:06.456
And who do you think
fabricated the evidence

14:06.523 --> 14:08.724
- against the accused?
- We know who it is.

14:08.759 --> 14:11.260
- It's Gillies.
- And who the devil is that?

14:11.328 --> 14:13.262
James Gillies is a very dangerous young man

14:13.263 --> 14:15.296
who wishes to destroy Detective Murdoch.

14:15.665 --> 14:17.432
Murdoch saw him in the courtroom.

14:17.433 --> 14:20.779
Ah. Well, since we're
entertaining theories,

14:20.805 --> 14:24.673
is it not equally possible that
you orchestrated all of this?

14:24.740 --> 14:26.708
- Me?
- Yes.

14:26.776 --> 14:29.377
You commit the crime, you set up Dr. Ogden,

14:29.445 --> 14:32.279
then you set about proving
Dr. Ogden's innocence

14:32.347 --> 14:34.482
by conjuring a personal nemesis.

14:34.549 --> 14:36.784
You present me with proof

14:36.852 --> 14:40.688
that Dr. Ogden is innocent,
and I'll stay the execution.

14:40.755 --> 14:45.092
If not, justice will take
its course as scheduled.

14:48.729 --> 14:52.565
You have subverted my authority,

14:52.600 --> 14:55.802
you have disregarded the
terms of your suspensions.

14:55.870 --> 14:58.671
- Sir, you are proceeding on a...
- Silence!

15:02.842 --> 15:08.079
Until this matter is resolved,
you are both... reinstated.

15:10.249 --> 15:12.150
Well, what are you standing about for?

15:12.184 --> 15:13.967
If Dr. Ogden is innocent,

15:14.168 --> 15:15.819
we haven't got much time to prove it.

15:21.789 --> 15:23.857
No doubt you figured out
how I recorded her voice,

15:23.924 --> 15:28.128
put her fingermarks on
the gun. And the mask.

15:28.162 --> 15:31.130
Well, by now you know all about the mask.

15:52.184 --> 15:56.845
Ah. Your Dr. Ogden has a beautiful face.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.122
I quite enjoyed wearing it.

15:58.157 --> 16:01.057
You should see the looks I got.

16:01.092 --> 16:03.761
Now, now, Detective.

16:03.795 --> 16:07.498
This film is my confession
to the murder of Dr. Garland.

16:07.565 --> 16:10.734
All the evidence you'll
need to exonerate Dr. Ogden.

16:12.771 --> 16:14.705
Show yourself!

16:14.773 --> 16:16.606
Here I am.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.843
Now, I know what you're
thinking: "How many mirrors?

16:20.877 --> 16:23.313
How far away is he?" Well, I'll tell you.

16:23.380 --> 16:27.149
I have five mirrors, each
with a concavity of 5%.

16:27.184 --> 16:29.719
Oh, look at you thinking.

16:29.753 --> 16:31.821
What is the function?

16:34.089 --> 16:37.592
You're in the house next door.

16:37.627 --> 16:39.093
To the south.

16:39.128 --> 16:43.031
Bravo! Well, I must say, it
is such a pleasure to have,

16:43.098 --> 16:45.834
well, such a capable
partner in this endeavour.

16:45.868 --> 16:47.502
Endeavour?

16:47.537 --> 16:49.670
To get Dr. Ogden exonerated.

16:49.738 --> 16:52.072
I don't want her to hang.

16:52.140 --> 16:57.077
I'm fascinated by the
idea of love, Detective.

16:57.178 --> 17:00.247
What will a man sacrifice
for the woman he loves?

17:04.018 --> 17:06.353
We have three days to
prove Dr. Ogden's innocence.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.688
And to do that, we need
to confirm her alibi.

17:08.756 --> 17:11.022
The woman, the one Dr.
Ogden took to Port Credit.

17:11.090 --> 17:12.726
Or at least the driver.

17:12.792 --> 17:15.094
You think Penelope was
working with James Gillies?

17:15.162 --> 17:18.431
I believe both she and the
driver were working with Gillies.

17:18.465 --> 17:22.534
It's a clever way to make
sure you have no alibi.

17:22.602 --> 17:24.536
Things she told me...

17:24.604 --> 17:26.739
details about what her
husband had done to her...

17:26.806 --> 17:28.741
it rang true, William.

17:28.808 --> 17:32.324
She told me he once pushed
her face in horse manure.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.947
It's despicable, to be sure,
but hardly beyond imagining.

17:36.015 --> 17:38.215
He did it in front of a
constable, and it cost him

17:38.283 --> 17:41.252
two months in jail. 

17:41.319 --> 17:43.654
I don't think she made it up, William.

17:43.722 --> 17:46.391
Perhaps that's why Gillies chose her.

17:46.458 --> 17:49.627
It's easier to lie about
things that you've lived.

17:49.695 --> 17:54.297
If that's the case, then
her husband does exist,

17:54.365 --> 17:58.502
not as Desmond Irwin,
perhaps, but he's out there.

17:58.569 --> 18:01.405
Time to go.

18:02.672 --> 18:03.986
I want you to go through every case

18:03.999 --> 18:06.175
of wife beating in the last five years.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.844
We're looking for a man
who shoved his wife's face

18:08.912 --> 18:11.246
in horse manure, among other things.

18:11.314 --> 18:14.149
- From Toronto, sir?
- From all of bloody Ontario.

18:14.217 --> 18:17.453
Sir, that'll be hundreds of cases.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.688
Have you got something
better to do, Higgins?

18:19.756 --> 18:22.257
We don't know where she's from, Henry.

18:22.292 --> 18:25.860
Start with the cases that
resulted in conviction.

18:25.895 --> 18:28.863
Of those, pull out the ones
where the husband's been released.

18:28.898 --> 18:30.558
That should help narrow down the search.

18:31.159 --> 18:31.559
Right, get on with it.

18:33.035 --> 18:36.838
George, I want you to concentrate your
energies on finding the coach driver.

18:36.872 --> 18:39.340
Sir, what if Gillies was the coach driver?

18:39.374 --> 18:40.874
Bloody hell, Crabtree.

18:40.909 --> 18:43.777
If Gillies was the coach driver,
who was shooting Dr. Garland?

18:43.812 --> 18:47.314
Well, I didn't think it
all the way through, sir.

18:49.684 --> 18:52.486
No, the mouth was slightly wider I think.

18:54.422 --> 18:56.022
That's more like it.

18:56.057 --> 18:57.623
Any facial hair?

18:57.658 --> 18:59.926
He had a beard. Same colour as his hair.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.427
Long?

19:01.462 --> 19:04.196
About an inch, I'd say, and not very thick

19:04.230 --> 19:06.165
around the cheek area.

19:09.402 --> 19:10.870
That's him.

19:10.904 --> 19:12.371
Are you sure.

19:12.405 --> 19:14.005
Excellent.

19:14.039 --> 19:16.341
Well, this will give
us soetething to go on.

19:16.375 --> 19:18.443
Dr. Ogden...

19:20.412 --> 19:24.349
when I had to testify against
you, I felt such a traitor.

19:24.383 --> 19:26.852
- I'm so sorry.
- George.

19:26.919 --> 19:28.986
You were compelled by law.

19:30.922 --> 19:34.692
This has been hard on all of us.

19:34.726 --> 19:37.160
Well, Detective Murdoch will
come through. I'm sure of it.

19:37.228 --> 19:40.731
He'd do anything... he'd
give his life for you.

19:44.368 --> 19:47.637
Doesn't every man tell his
lover he would die for her?

19:47.671 --> 19:50.540
But how many truly would?

19:50.574 --> 19:52.742
Would you? I know you'd fight for her,

19:52.810 --> 19:57.413
to the death if necessary, but
to actually trade your life?

19:57.447 --> 20:01.850
That is my experiment, Detective.

20:01.918 --> 20:04.449
That phone is connected
to the telephone exchange.

20:04.450 --> 20:05.550
Simply lift the receiver,

20:05.655 --> 20:07.789
have the operator
connect you to the police,

20:07.824 --> 20:10.091
and then tell them where to
find you and the evidence.

20:10.159 --> 20:14.763
BUT... if you lift the receiver,
it activates an automatic valve

20:14.831 --> 20:16.931
which will fill the room
with carbon monoxide.

20:16.965 --> 20:20.434
- Do you know what that is?
- Of course I do.

20:20.502 --> 20:23.938
You will lose consciousness
within a minute.

20:24.006 --> 20:27.107
Death will follow minutes after.

20:27.175 --> 20:29.143
So, Detective,

20:29.177 --> 20:31.211
what will it be?

20:35.016 --> 20:37.551
I'll let you know once I've decided.

20:40.588 --> 20:43.523
These are quite detailed.
Very good, George.

20:43.591 --> 20:45.458
I found him!

20:45.526 --> 20:48.294
Sirs, his name is Harold Long.
He was convicted in Toronto

20:48.328 --> 20:50.295
of assault, sentenced to six months.

20:50.363 --> 20:51.797
How do we know it's him?

20:51.865 --> 20:54.399
He shoved his wife's face
into horse manure, sir.

20:59.773 --> 21:01.707
Toronto Constabulary.

21:01.741 --> 21:03.676
Do you recognize this woman?

21:03.743 --> 21:05.977
That's Dolly,

21:06.011 --> 21:08.846
- my wife.
- Dolly?

21:08.881 --> 21:11.049
Where can we find her?

21:11.083 --> 21:13.952
I don't know. Uh, she and I...

21:13.986 --> 21:16.955
- we had a falling out.
- Oh, is that what you call it?

21:17.302 --> 21:18.758
You beat her till she bled

21:18.759 --> 21:20.788
and then you pushed her face
into a pile of horse crap.

21:20.992 --> 21:22.735
I've done some terrible things,

21:22.736 --> 21:24.807
but I've since fallen
under the light of the Lord.

21:25.229 --> 21:27.363
Oh, well, that's all very fascinating.

21:27.398 --> 21:31.068
- We just want to find her.
- I came back to an empty house.

21:31.135 --> 21:33.236
Her sister told me she'd left the country.

21:33.304 --> 21:35.872
She has a sister?

21:36.310 --> 21:38.243
When she heard he was being
released, she came to live

21:38.278 --> 21:40.679
with us, but we both knew he'd find her.

21:40.713 --> 21:43.482
- Where is she?
- Hamilton.

21:43.516 --> 21:45.351
Do you have an address?

21:45.418 --> 21:47.219
She ran out of money.

21:47.253 --> 21:49.388
I would have helped her, but I couldn't.

21:49.422 --> 21:51.056
She ended up...

21:51.091 --> 21:55.126
selling herself on the streets.
I don't know where she is now.

21:55.160 --> 21:58.129
Thank you.

21:58.163 --> 22:00.431
Wait.

22:00.466 --> 22:03.767
Would a photograph of her help?

22:03.802 --> 22:07.538
This is Dolly Long, also
known as Penelope Irwin.

22:07.572 --> 22:09.634
I want each of you to take
a copy of the photograph

22:09.635 --> 22:10.909
and a train ticket to Hamilton.

22:11.809 --> 22:14.411
According to her sister,
she's walking the streets,

22:14.445 --> 22:15.925
so we're going to concentrate our search

22:15.926 --> 22:17.926
on the dock areas and lower downtown.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.572
Remember to dress in your civvies.

22:20.606 --> 22:23.208
I don't want any run-ins
with the Hamilton police.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.009
Right, then, chop-chop!

22:30.782 --> 22:34.685
- I understand you know this woman.
- You two friends of hers?

22:37.122 --> 22:39.357
It's important we find her.

22:39.391 --> 22:41.992
Her name is Dolly.

22:42.026 --> 22:44.894
Haven't seen her for a bit.
She keeps a room upstairs.

23:11.486 --> 23:14.588
- It's Dolly Long, sir.
- There goes Dr. Ogden's alibi.

23:14.656 --> 23:16.724
Why would he bury her in salt?

23:16.791 --> 23:19.892
I believe because he didn't
want the body discovered

23:19.960 --> 23:24.063
- until the end of the trial.
- And, sir, look. Gunpowder burns.

23:24.131 --> 23:27.066
That's how Gillies got blood spatter
on Dr. Ogden's dress. It's her blood.

23:27.134 --> 23:29.830
So he took Dr. Ogden's
dress, shot her alibi,

23:29.831 --> 23:31.921
and then dumped the dress in her rubbish.

23:32.406 --> 23:35.440
Sir, if that's the case,

23:35.508 --> 23:38.042
then she was shot the
same day as Dr. Garland

23:38.110 --> 23:41.980
George, interview the
tenants in the building.

23:42.014 --> 23:44.316
See if anyone recalls
hearing a shot that night.

23:44.384 --> 23:45.917
Sir.

23:49.289 --> 23:50.821
Sir.

24:04.169 --> 24:07.404
Thirty-eight revolver. Conveniently placed.

24:07.438 --> 24:09.406
We'll need to take this with us.

24:09.473 --> 24:11.941
And the body too.

24:11.975 --> 24:14.944
That would be a serious
breach of jurisdiction.

24:15.012 --> 24:17.947
We don't have time to mess around
with the Hamilton police and coroner.

24:17.981 --> 24:21.451
Sir, what I mean to say is that
it needn't be your decision.

24:21.519 --> 24:23.118
Sod that.

24:23.186 --> 24:26.054
We'll hang together,
after we clear her name.

24:28.191 --> 24:30.459
Given the state of the
decay of the exposed hand,

24:30.493 --> 24:33.061
I'd estimate it was about a month ago.

24:33.095 --> 24:36.064
So she could have been killed
the same day as Dr. Garland.

24:36.132 --> 24:38.300
That would certainly
be within the timeframe.

24:38.334 --> 24:41.035
- Did you recover the bullet?
- I did.

24:41.069 --> 24:43.971
- Thirty-eight calibre?
- Yes.

24:44.039 --> 24:46.474
Detective? Ah, sir.

24:46.508 --> 24:49.977
Two tenants in Dolly Long's
building heard a single shot

24:50.045 --> 24:51.979
about a month ago. One of them claims

24:52.013 --> 24:55.482
that a woman in a green dress left
the building shortly thereafter.

24:55.516 --> 24:57.150
Gillies in disguise.

24:57.184 --> 24:59.486
Check the weapon for fingermarks.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.321
Sir, will do. Also,

25:01.356 --> 25:03.590
Chief Constable Giles is at the station.

25:03.624 --> 25:05.925
He wants you to report in.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.027
Thank you.

25:11.230 --> 25:13.599
Is there no law that you won't break?

25:13.633 --> 25:16.935
No rule that you won't see
fit to bend to your own ends?

25:16.970 --> 25:19.938
- Time was of the essence, sir.
- I'm aware of your constraints,

25:19.973 --> 25:23.108
but I too am constrained by
the dictates of my profession.

25:23.142 --> 25:25.110
And that may mean
nothing to you scoff-laws,

25:25.144 --> 25:28.112
- but it means a great deal to me.
- We'll take full responsibility.

25:28.146 --> 25:30.114
Oh, you will do more than
that. You will, both of you,

25:30.148 --> 25:32.151
compose a sincere letter of apology

25:32.152 --> 25:33.470
to the Chief Constable of Hamilton

25:33.652 --> 25:36.954
and to the coroner. And you will
return the evidence forthwith.

25:36.989 --> 25:39.257
After we've finished with it, of course.

25:39.291 --> 25:41.760
You're in no position
to bargain, Inspector.

25:41.827 --> 25:44.762
We're not bargaining, sir; we're asking.

25:47.599 --> 25:49.767
You have until the end of day.

25:49.801 --> 25:53.370
Sirs, I've found fingermarks on the weapon.

25:53.405 --> 25:56.306
- Whose are they, George?
- Dr. Ogden's.

25:56.340 --> 25:58.708
Of course they are.

25:58.742 --> 26:02.378
Mr. Gillies is nothing if not thorough.

26:02.413 --> 26:05.214
So, where does that leave us, then?

26:05.248 --> 26:07.182
Well, we can't take this
evidence to Judge Matthews.

26:07.250 --> 26:09.018
He'll simply think that
Dr. Ogden was the killer.

26:09.052 --> 26:12.522
- But why would she kill her own alibi?
- It doesn't matter.

26:12.589 --> 26:16.758
Judge Matthews has no vested interest
in seeing Dr. Ogden exonerated.

26:16.793 --> 26:19.093
He believes that she killed her husband,

26:19.128 --> 26:22.664
and this evidence will only
serve to cement that impression.

26:22.698 --> 26:25.967
With the woman dead, you have
to find the carriage driver.

26:43.683 --> 26:45.118
What do you two want this time?

26:45.186 --> 26:46.719
This man.

26:50.023 --> 26:51.624
Sorry.

26:51.692 --> 26:53.460
I seen him.

26:53.527 --> 26:55.061
You have?

26:55.095 --> 26:57.063
He used to pick up Dolly, and only Dolly.

26:57.130 --> 26:59.732
If she was with someone, he'd wait,

26:59.800 --> 27:02.234
but he never went upstairs with her.

27:02.269 --> 27:04.169
- Do you know who he is?
- No.

27:04.203 --> 27:06.404
- But you're sure it was him
- It was him all right,

27:06.473 --> 27:08.507
except he had shorter hair.

27:17.316 --> 27:19.851
Call it a night, Murdoch.
You'll need your wits about you

27:19.918 --> 27:22.854
if we're to find Gillies.

27:22.888 --> 27:25.823
I'll try to get some
sleep, you have my word.

27:45.242 --> 27:49.579
It was him all right,
except he had shorter hair.

28:20.576 --> 28:21.898
If Gillies was the coach driver,

28:21.899 --> 28:23.397
who was shooting Dr. Garland?

29:01.847 --> 29:05.116
Darcy.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.188
Darcy.

29:12.290 --> 29:13.824
Darcy.

29:45.387 --> 29:47.823
Darcy.

29:50.126 --> 29:52.059
Darcy.

29:54.029 --> 29:56.396
Darcy? 

30:15.000 --> 30:17.269
So, what will it be, Detective?

30:17.303 --> 30:19.937
Will she die, or will you?

30:24.876 --> 30:27.311
The clock on the wall reads eight o'clock,

30:27.345 --> 30:31.214
so either it's wrong or
you've been here for...

30:31.283 --> 30:34.485
Twenty hours. How?

30:34.519 --> 30:37.220
There's a new drug developed
by the Bayer company.

30:37.289 --> 30:39.723
It's used to put dogs
down, but in a lower dosage

30:39.758 --> 30:41.957
it puts humans in a temporary coma.

30:41.992 --> 30:46.061
That means she hangs in less than 12 hours.

30:46.096 --> 30:48.564
By the time the clock comes back to eight,

30:48.632 --> 30:50.500
she'll be dead.

30:55.439 --> 30:59.075
Sir, I've been to the
courthouse, City Hall, the jail.

30:59.175 --> 31:02.411
There's no sign of the detective anywhere.

31:02.445 --> 31:05.514
Jackson! Where the
bloody hell have you been?

31:05.548 --> 31:09.184
- I was... I was off duty, sir.
- Off duty?

31:09.218 --> 31:11.219
Dr. Ogden has got 12 hours to live.

31:11.253 --> 31:14.388
- Were you at this desk last night?
- Yes, sir.

31:14.423 --> 31:17.391
- So did you see Murdoch leave?
- About 10 o'clock, sir.

31:17.426 --> 31:19.527
- Well, where he was going?
- He didn't say.

31:19.561 --> 31:21.094
Why the hell didn't you ask?

31:21.129 --> 31:24.031
I gather you haven't heard anything.

31:24.065 --> 31:25.766
No.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.768
Then I think we should
assume for the purposes

31:27.803 --> 31:32.004
of this investigation that Murdoch is dead.

31:32.039 --> 31:34.907
- Dead?
- I can think of only one

31:34.942 --> 31:37.877
scenario where Murdoch would
fail to make communication:

31:37.911 --> 31:40.213
he found out where Gillies
was and left to confront him.

31:40.247 --> 31:43.383
You can draw your own conclusions
as to how that turned out.

31:43.417 --> 31:47.553
- You cold-blooded bastard.
- Whatever Murdoch's fate,

31:47.587 --> 31:51.923
the thrust of this investigation
must be to exonerate Dr. Ogden.

31:51.958 --> 31:53.792
Godspeed,

31:53.827 --> 31:55.461
gentlemen.

31:57.397 --> 31:59.365
Sir...

31:59.399 --> 32:01.666
I think he's right...

32:01.734 --> 32:04.301
in that Detective Murdoch
went to confront Gillies.

32:04.336 --> 32:06.804
He found something, sir,
something we're missing.

32:11.510 --> 32:14.034
Bloody hell. This is
what Murdoch figured out.

32:14.035 --> 32:15.960
Gillies was driving the coach.

32:16.314 --> 32:18.415
Sir, that means he was with Dr. Ogden

32:18.449 --> 32:21.117
at the time of the
murder. If that's the case,

32:21.185 --> 32:23.420
who shot Dr. Garland?

32:26.257 --> 32:29.693
William is missing?

32:29.727 --> 32:32.161
I wondered why he hadn't come.

32:32.229 --> 32:33.848
I should have told you earlier,

32:33.849 --> 32:36.109
but I was hoping he would
have returned by now.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.934
He must be in trouble.

32:39.002 --> 32:43.639
Perhaps he simply hasn't had time
to communicate what he's found.

32:43.673 --> 32:46.876
He'll come through.

32:46.943 --> 32:48.543
He always does.

32:48.611 --> 32:52.447
You want me to believe in miracles.

32:52.481 --> 32:54.816
Why not?

32:54.817 --> 32:58.286
The absurdity of it all.

33:01.089 --> 33:02.752
There's so much I wanted do with my life.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.289
I pray William's all right.

33:17.906 --> 33:20.373
I just can't figure it, Crabtree.

33:20.441 --> 33:23.042
How did he do it?

33:23.109 --> 33:25.244
Sir.

33:25.312 --> 33:28.648
- That's Detective Murdoch's hat.
- Murdoch!

33:30.584 --> 33:33.719
Right, let's search the
whole house, top to bottom.

33:33.754 --> 33:36.155
Sir!

33:36.222 --> 33:37.756
Sir?

33:44.764 --> 33:49.367
It's welded on, but, by all means, try.

33:55.306 --> 33:58.709
Detective, do you really think
I'd use a lock you could pick?

33:58.743 --> 34:03.146
There are only two ways out, Detective:

34:03.181 --> 34:05.082
allow her to her hang,

34:05.116 --> 34:06.917
and I'll let you go;

34:06.952 --> 34:10.652
or pick up the phone, save her life,

34:10.688 --> 34:13.857
and let your soul go free.

34:18.428 --> 34:20.429
You're looking for me, aren't you?

34:20.464 --> 34:23.431
My face is just a camera
obscura projection,

34:23.467 --> 34:27.335
but that's not how I
see you. So where am I?

34:32.208 --> 34:35.577
Very good.

34:38.014 --> 34:42.583
Go ahead, but then you won't
get to see the rest of my film,

34:42.618 --> 34:44.719
wiwith the evidence
that will exonerate her.

34:53.962 --> 34:56.030
Good boy, Detective.

34:58.499 --> 35:03.269
Sir, that's it, every inch.
There's no sign of him.

35:03.303 --> 35:05.371
Bloody Hell.

35:10.477 --> 35:12.978
What are you doing?

35:22.923 --> 35:26.692
Oh, such purpose. What are you going to do?

35:26.726 --> 35:29.293
I want to see the rest of the film.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.540
Very good, Murdoch,

35:42.575 --> 35:45.475
very good. You needed to blind me.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.811
You're up to something.

35:47.845 --> 35:51.481
- What are you planning, Murdoch?
- I'm checking to see

35:51.549 --> 35:54.484
if you're as clever as you think you are.

35:54.552 --> 35:57.253
Very sneaky, Murdoch.

35:57.288 --> 35:59.189
Why did you do that?

35:59.256 --> 36:01.290
Why did you try to blind me?

36:03.259 --> 36:04.894
Because I could.

36:08.065 --> 36:10.700
Well played, Murdoch.

36:10.767 --> 36:13.035
Which is a crueller punishment:

36:13.103 --> 36:14.704
to kill a man,

36:14.771 --> 36:17.939
or to destroy the most
precious thing in his life?

36:18.007 --> 36:20.174
Which hurts more?

36:29.785 --> 36:32.520
Number, please.

36:32.588 --> 36:34.521
Morse code?

36:34.555 --> 36:37.524
Oh, yes, Inspector. I checked my handbook.

36:37.592 --> 36:40.027
It repeats in three sections of five.

36:40.061 --> 36:42.362
Someone is trying to send a message.

36:42.430 --> 36:44.531
- When did this come in?
- Six o'clock.

36:44.599 --> 36:45.495
It was the first call through this morning.

36:45.496 --> 36:48.522
It's spelling the numbers 6,9,1.

36:48.936 --> 36:52.538
It's Murdoch. I'm sure of it.
Where did the call come from?

36:52.572 --> 36:54.707
We can identify the neighbourhood,

36:54.742 --> 36:56.875
but we'll have to physically trace it.

36:56.909 --> 36:58.376
It may take a while.

36:58.444 --> 37:01.046
Get on it immediately. It's an emergency.

37:01.114 --> 37:04.716
Six, nine, one? Six, nine, one.

37:04.751 --> 37:07.185
There you have it, Detective Murdoch.

37:07.219 --> 37:11.657
A full confession. All
the evidence she'll need.

37:11.691 --> 37:14.091
The decision is yours.

37:22.801 --> 37:25.102
Are you satisfied, Detective?

37:25.137 --> 37:27.071
Yes.

37:27.105 --> 37:29.072
One telephone call...

37:29.106 --> 37:34.144
that's all it takes to save her life.

37:34.178 --> 37:36.412
Yes, I've got it. No,
that's fine, I've got it.

37:36.446 --> 37:38.550
Sir, they've traced the
signal to a switch box

37:38.551 --> 37:39.924
in the Sherbourne-Jarvis area.

37:40.051 --> 37:42.018
Jarvis? Garland lives on Jarvis St.

37:42.053 --> 37:44.020
Yes, sir. Dr. Garland lived at 693.

37:44.055 --> 37:46.689
The Morse code message spelled out 691.

37:46.723 --> 37:50.092
- Next door. Crarree, break out the armoury.
- Yes, sir.

37:52.028 --> 37:55.097
I must admit, Detective,
I am just so curious

37:55.131 --> 37:57.199
as to what you are up to.

37:59.135 --> 38:02.103
How do I know this telephone is working?

38:02.137 --> 38:05.306
Well, you'll just have to trust me.

38:05.340 --> 38:09.476
It's decision time, Detective. Who lives?

38:09.511 --> 38:13.715
You, or your lady love?

38:13.782 --> 38:16.584
You have one hour.

38:20.521 --> 38:23.556
Well, then, I guess it's
goodbye, Mr. Gillies.

38:36.870 --> 38:40.806
Operator, put me through to
Stationhouse n°4. It's an emergency.

38:42.876 --> 38:44.977
Hello. It's Detective Murdoch.

38:45.011 --> 38:48.280
Please listen very carefully
to what I'm about to say.

38:54.220 --> 38:56.520
Briscoe, you two take the upstairs.

38:56.555 --> 38:58.723
Baker, cover this floor.
Crabtree, come with me.

38:58.758 --> 39:00.191
Aye aye, sir.

39:00.259 --> 39:02.927
Detective Murdoch. Detective Murdoch!

39:07.198 --> 39:10.901
Detective Murdoch!

39:10.969 --> 39:14.138
James Gillies! Hands where I can see them!

39:14.205 --> 39:17.040
It's too late for your
Detective, I'm afraid.

39:17.108 --> 39:18.708
Cuff him, Crabtree.

39:26.549 --> 39:29.085
Sir, it's Detective Murdoch.

39:34.391 --> 39:36.992
Sir! Can you see the lock,

39:37.059 --> 39:39.060
- Crabtree?
- Top corner, there, sir.

39:39.128 --> 39:40.929
Got it!

39:42.631 --> 39:45.233
Sir, are you all right?

39:45.268 --> 39:47.735
- What time is it?
- Seven-twenty.

39:47.804 --> 39:49.370
The... the film.

39:49.438 --> 39:51.673
- What film?
- The projector. Get the film!

39:51.707 --> 39:53.540
Move it, Crabtree!

40:11.992 --> 40:14.753
A moment, gentlemen. My hair is a fright.

40:42.119 --> 40:44.121
Do you have anything you wish to say?

40:50.028 --> 40:53.530
If William Murdoch should ask
what my final words were...

40:56.268 --> 41:00.837
tell him he never failed
me, and that I so loved him.

41:17.553 --> 41:20.289
- No! No, stop!
- What...

41:20.357 --> 41:23.625
We have the killer! This is his confession!

41:23.659 --> 41:25.961
She's innocent.

41:25.996 --> 41:29.597
Take the noose off her neck.

41:34.203 --> 41:36.971
You'd better not be stalling
for time, Detective Murdoch.

41:37.006 --> 41:40.775
I'm not, Your Honour,
I swear to you, I'm not.

41:40.809 --> 41:43.311
It's all right.

41:43.379 --> 41:47.080
It's all right.

41:52.823 --> 41:56.292
Hello, Detective Murdoch. Remember me?

41:56.327 --> 41:58.260
I know what you're thinking:

41:58.328 --> 42:01.430
"Now I understand how
rats get caught in traps.

42:01.498 --> 42:03.399
They're easy to fool!"

42:03.433 --> 42:06.201
Welcome to the Murdoch Trap, Detective.

42:06.269 --> 42:11.407
We are going to have so much fun.

42:11.441 --> 42:14.275
Shall we go to dinner? Celebrate?

42:14.309 --> 42:17.478
I don't know, William.

42:17.546 --> 42:20.915
What is it?

42:24.653 --> 42:28.589
Darcy is dead because of me...

42:28.657 --> 42:32.025
- because of us.
- Julia...

42:32.060 --> 42:33.927
Can you deny it?

42:36.330 --> 42:38.831
No.

42:43.371 --> 42:45.405
I should rest.

42:48.041 --> 42:50.242
Some other time, then.

42:50.310 --> 42:53.379
Yes.
