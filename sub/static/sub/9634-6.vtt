[NARRATOR] Goku and Bulma
have their five Dragon Balls,

02:00.750 --> 02:03.792
and are crossing the desert
in search of the sixth.

02:03.875 --> 02:06.417
[NARRATOR] But a treacherous
plan is being hatched to

02:06.500 --> 02:08.625
spoil their mission.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.084
[liquid pouring]

02:14.542 --> 02:17.292
Let's get going, Puar.
We can't let those three slip

02:17.375 --> 02:18.375
through our fingers.

02:18.459 --> 02:20.459
Huh? But what about the girl,
Yamcha?

02:20.542 --> 02:21.875
Remember?

02:21.959 --> 02:23.292
[chuckling]

02:23.375 --> 02:25.334
Leave that to me.
I've got a plan.

02:33.792 --> 02:36.417
So, why didn't you tell
us before that you had this

02:36.500 --> 02:39.709
camper Dyno-Cap, Oolong? Hmm?

02:39.792 --> 02:42.125
Well you didn't exactly ask me,
now did you?

02:42.209 --> 02:44.792
Besides, I didn't want
those bandits to steal it.

02:44.875 --> 02:46.167
[chomping]

02:46.250 --> 02:47.459
[OOLONG] Kid, watch
yourself, you're gonna choke.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.584
Mmm...This is good.

02:49.667 --> 02:52.084
I hope I see Yamcha again.

02:52.167 --> 02:54.875
He was so shy and so handsome...

02:54.959 --> 02:56.584
[BULMA] Does this
place have a tub?

02:56.667 --> 02:58.459
[OOLONG] Yeah, right in there.

03:00.667 --> 03:03.125
[BULMA] Huh. To
tell you the truth,

03:03.209 --> 03:04.875
I'm used to much
nicer accommodations.

03:04.959 --> 03:07.542
[OOLONG] Then why don't you try
a luxury hotel down the road?

03:07.625 --> 03:10.209
I'm sure there are lots of
'em out here in the desert!

03:10.292 --> 03:12.084
It's just that it's so small.

03:12.167 --> 03:14.125
Well it ain't no palace,
but I don't see any

03:14.209 --> 03:16.167
royalty around either,
get it?

03:17.667 --> 03:19.459
Now what are you looking for?

03:20.084 --> 03:21.250
[BULMA] Peepholes.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.292
Hey! What kind of place
you think I'm runnin'?!

03:23.375 --> 03:25.084
Well, I wouldn't
put it past you.

03:25.167 --> 03:26.334
What?

03:26.792 --> 03:28.000
[BULMA] You little perv.

03:28.084 --> 03:30.042
[chuckling]

03:30.792 --> 03:32.917
[OOLONG] I'll let you
win the battle, sister,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
but I'm gonna win the war.

03:44.417 --> 03:58.250
[crickets chirping]

03:58.334 --> 04:08.292
[mechanical springing]

04:09.209 --> 04:13.167
[beeping]

04:15.334 --> 04:18.416
[MAI] Emperor. Spy pods
are now in position.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.709
We are ready to put
operation "Desert Dragon Bomb"

04:20.791 --> 04:22.000
into effect. Over.

04:22.084 --> 04:27.000
Good. Proceed as planned,
Agent Mai. Base out.

04:28.667 --> 04:29.625
[MAI] Let's go!

04:33.000 --> 04:33.959
[MAI] Come on!

04:37.917 --> 04:39.417
[beeping]

04:39.500 --> 04:41.459
[SHU] It's set to go
off in four minutes.

04:46.792 --> 04:47.709
[MAI] Huh?

04:47.792 --> 04:49.209
[running footsteps]

04:49.292 --> 04:50.667
Shu, somebody's out there!

04:50.750 --> 04:51.375
[SHU] Hm?

04:51.459 --> 04:52.459
Let's get out of here.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.167
[SHU] Mai, I think
we have a problem.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.000
The bomb is stuck to my hand.

04:56.084 --> 04:57.000
[squealing]

04:57.084 --> 04:58.709
This isn't good, Shu!

04:58.792 --> 05:00.167
What should I do?!

05:00.834 --> 05:02.917
[running footsteps]

05:03.000 --> 05:05.375
You better wait here.
I'll go get help.

05:05.459 --> 05:07.417
[SHU] Hey, wait for me!

05:09.292 --> 05:12.125
[YAMCHA] Mm-hmm...a
double-decker camper.

05:12.209 --> 05:15.000
I'll bet we can get a decent
price for a rig like that.

05:15.084 --> 05:17.042
But what about the girl?

05:17.834 --> 05:19.084
[chuckling]

05:19.167 --> 05:23.000
Easy. All we have to do
is find a way to lure her

05:23.084 --> 05:26.042
out of there for a few minutes.
Then we sneak in and

05:26.125 --> 05:27.959
rob them blind! Ha ha ha!

05:28.042 --> 05:30.000
[PUAR] You're
starting to scare me.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.834
You think we're safe out here?

05:31.917 --> 05:34.542
Don't worry! The worst
thing that could happen to us

05:34.625 --> 05:36.000
is they take our stuff.

05:37.042 --> 05:39.750
That's it, huh? Well I
don't know if you've noticed,

05:39.834 --> 05:42.959
but I've got some
very serious cargo here.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.917
You're not worried,
'cause you don't

05:45.000 --> 05:46.375
have anything worth stealing.

05:46.459 --> 05:48.292
Yeah-huh. My Dragon Ball.

05:48.375 --> 05:51.584
Huh? Dragon Ball?
What's that?

05:51.667 --> 05:53.584
[GOKU] Well, Bulma asked
me not to show you,

05:53.667 --> 05:55.042
but...I guess it's okay.

05:56.417 --> 05:57.375
Neat, huh?

05:59.792 --> 06:12.750
--[water running]
--[BULMA humming]

06:18.000 --> 06:31.000
[BULMA humming]

06:38.334 --> 06:40.417
Okay, she's right above us.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.875
[PUAR] Master, can you see if
the other two are with her?

06:44.917 --> 06:45.875
Hang on.

06:47.084 --> 06:49.375
[YAMCHA stuttering]

06:49.459 --> 06:51.500
[YAMCHA screaming]

06:51.584 --> 06:53.500
[YAMCHA whimpering]

06:53.584 --> 06:55.959
Yamcha?! What happened?!
Are you all right?!

06:56.667 --> 06:57.334
[BULMA] Hmm? 

06:57.792 --> 06:59.375
Is something out there?

07:04.459 --> 07:05.417
Hm? Oh well.

07:07.709 --> 07:10.125
I hate turning
into a bowl of mush

07:10.209 --> 07:11.709
everytime I see a girl!

07:11.792 --> 07:13.167
It's not your fault...

07:13.792 --> 07:14.709
[PUAR and YAMCHA] Hmm?

07:14.792 --> 07:15.917
I think I hear something.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.542
[OOLONG] Are you sure it's true?

07:17.625 --> 07:19.459
It's the pig
and the kid. Hmph.

07:19.542 --> 07:22.000
[OOLONG] So, when you get all
seven Dragon Balls together,

07:22.084 --> 07:24.042
the Dragon appears
and grants a wish?

07:25.084 --> 07:27.209
[GOKU] Uh-huh. Yep, that's
right.

07:27.292 --> 07:28.959
[OOLONG] Any wish
you can think of?

07:29.042 --> 07:31.000
Guess so.
That's what Bulma said.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.625
So, how many more
Dragon Balls do you need?

07:33.709 --> 07:35.042
Just two.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.334
[OOLONG] Heh! We're on to
something really big here,

07:37.417 --> 07:38.709
Goku old pal!

07:38.792 --> 07:40.167
--Come on.
--Right!

07:42.542 --> 07:44.417
Well, it seems
we hit the jackpot!

07:44.500 --> 07:45.625
Yeah?

07:45.709 --> 07:47.500
Puar, you know what
this means, don't you?!

07:47.584 --> 07:49.459
What Yamcha?

07:49.542 --> 07:54.500
I will never be shy
around women again! Never!

07:55.792 --> 07:58.334
But Yamcha, if you
could have any wish,

07:58.417 --> 08:01.584
then you could rule the world
and have all the riches in it.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.792
Come on! How long
have you been with me?

08:04.875 --> 08:08.125
[PUAR] It's been two years,
one month, and three days.

08:08.209 --> 08:10.625
After all this time,
I thought you really

08:10.709 --> 08:12.250
would have
known me by now.

08:12.334 --> 08:13.625
[PUAR] I thought so too...

08:13.709 --> 08:15.917
Well, my furry
friend, you don't.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.625
I have no aspirations
to rule the world. Understand?

08:19.709 --> 08:21.625
I think I do...

08:21.709 --> 08:25.792
[YAMCHA] No... I want what no
riches in the world can buy...

08:25.875 --> 08:29.667
Don't you see that one
day I'd like to get married?

08:30.084 --> 08:32.708
Or at least be
able to ask a girl out

08:32.792 --> 08:35.250
on one single, lousy date!

08:35.333 --> 08:37.208
See what happens
when you don't have

08:37.292 --> 08:38.875
an afternoon nap, Master?

08:42.375 --> 08:45.542
From now on,
we have only those

08:45.625 --> 08:50.459
Dragon Balls in our sights!
We'll get them. Mark my words.

08:50.542 --> 08:52.875
You know, kid?
We need to cut Bulma out.

08:52.959 --> 08:54.542
That's all there is to it.

08:54.625 --> 08:56.417
But Bulma and I are partners.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.792
Why would you
want to cut her out?

08:57.875 --> 09:01.250
Look, kid, she's
a girl and we're guys.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.542
And we're going to want
to wish for some guy things.

09:05.625 --> 09:09.625
Like, a harem with
three-hundred girls!

09:10.750 --> 09:13.542
Golly, why would you
wanna have three-hundred girls?

09:14.542 --> 09:16.084
Huh? How's that, kid?

09:16.167 --> 09:18.250
Well, can you imagine
what it would be like

09:18.334 --> 09:20.292
having three-hundred
Bulmas to listen to?

09:21.959 --> 09:24.500
How dare you talk
behind my back, Goku?!

09:24.584 --> 09:27.459
I was just, uh...
Oh, nevermind.

09:27.542 --> 09:30.500
Oolong, do you have
any extra pajamas?

09:31.209 --> 09:33.500
Oh, like mine
would fit you.

09:33.584 --> 09:36.875
[BULMA] So what am I
supposed to wear to bed, then?

09:36.959 --> 09:38.792
What am I,
your butler?!

09:38.875 --> 09:41.709
Well, with that
hat you look like one.

09:41.792 --> 09:45.834
[BULMA] Or a limo driver,
or something.

09:45.917 --> 09:49.292
[OOLONG] Here you go. This cold
juice will calm your nerves.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.625
You can be a sweet swine,
can't you?

09:51.709 --> 09:54.000
More than you'll ever know.

09:54.084 --> 09:56.042
Aw, thank you.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.459
[snickering]

09:58.542 --> 09:59.500
[sniffing]

10:01.917 --> 10:03.667
Eww, this stuff's gross!

10:03.750 --> 10:05.209
[OOLONG] It's for,
uh, health nuts.

10:05.292 --> 10:07.375
It's, uh, supposed
to make you strong.

10:07.459 --> 10:09.417
Oh well.
Down the hatch.

10:11.792 --> 10:12.959
[snickering]

10:13.042 --> 10:15.000
I do feel stronger!

10:16.125 --> 10:17.709
You want some, Oolong?

10:17.792 --> 10:20.750
Oh, for me?
I, uh, had mine already.

10:24.375 --> 10:27.042
So where do I sleep?
I'm tired...

10:27.125 --> 10:29.167
Just go right up
those stairs there.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.209
[BULMA] Good night.

10:32.167 --> 10:34.250
And you better
not come up here!

10:34.334 --> 10:36.959
Or I'll just have to make
the 'piggy' sound again,

10:37.042 --> 10:39.709
and you'll be going "Wee, wee
wee! All the way home"! Get it?

10:39.792 --> 10:40.959
Gotcha.

10:41.042 --> 10:42.959
[BULMA] And since you're
not doing anything,

10:43.042 --> 10:44.917
I want my clothes
cleaned by morning.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.084
Right.

10:47.167 --> 10:50.125
[OOLONG grumbling]

10:51.084 --> 10:52.542
Boy, the way
she was nagging me,

10:52.625 --> 10:54.500
you would think we
were married or something.

10:54.584 --> 10:57.459
I'll never understand women.

10:57.542 --> 10:58.584
Huh?

10:58.667 --> 11:02.542
[snoring]

11:02.625 --> 11:05.375
[OOLONG] That sleeping powder
works faster than I thought!

11:05.459 --> 11:07.709
[OOLONG] Stealing the Dragon
Balls is gonna be a cinch

11:07.792 --> 11:09.584
with these kids knocked out!

11:25.625 --> 11:26.584
[SHU] Uh-oh!

11:27.084 --> 11:28.000
[MAI] Hurry, Shu!

11:28.084 --> 11:32.292
Something's wrong!
It won't stop!

11:32.375 --> 11:34.334
It's gonna blow in
less than a minute!

11:34.417 --> 11:36.209
[MAI screaming]

11:37.000 --> 11:40.375
Oh, what am I gonna do?
I'm too young to blow up...

11:46.375 --> 11:48.875
What happened?
Tell me, Shu!

11:48.959 --> 11:50.625
Nothing to worry about,
Mai.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.334
I reset it for eight
o'clock tomorrow morning.

11:53.417 --> 11:54.417
Then: boom.

11:55.084 --> 11:58.667
[GOKU snoring]

11:58.750 --> 12:01.709
[chuckling]

12:04.792 --> 12:07.000
[OOLONG] I bet the Dragon
Balls are upstairs...

12:07.084 --> 12:09.042
and I know the first
place I'm gonna look.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.250
It's all clear, Yamcha.

12:16.334 --> 12:18.667
All right, Puar.
This is it. You know what to do?

12:18.750 --> 12:19.542
Uh-huh!

12:24.292 --> 12:25.250
[lock clicking]

12:28.792 --> 12:35.792
[chuckling]

12:39.167 --> 12:41.125
What's that?!

12:43.417 --> 12:45.375
This kid is really zonked out!

12:46.500 --> 12:48.709
I wonder where the
other two have gone?

12:48.792 --> 12:50.250
I guess they're upstairs.

12:50.334 --> 12:53.125
Puar, I want you to
change into this kid here

12:53.209 --> 12:55.292
and lure the
others outside, okay?

12:55.375 --> 12:56.334
Okay!

12:59.750 --> 13:02.709
How could Goku be awake
after that dose I gave him?!

13:06.625 --> 13:09.209
[OOLONG] I don't get it!
I put enough in his drink

13:09.292 --> 13:11.000
to knock out a horse!

13:11.084 --> 13:14.459
[OOLONG] If that little imp
catches me up here, he's sure to

13:14.542 --> 13:17.334
squeal to Bulma and
she'll fry my bacon good!

13:17.417 --> 13:18.750
I gotta think of something fast!

13:18.834 --> 13:19.792
Oh, I know!

13:24.834 --> 13:26.834
Oh, hi, Goku!
You scared me!

13:26.917 --> 13:28.875
[PUAR] Hey.
Where's Oolong?

13:30.459 --> 13:31.750
Oolong?

13:31.834 --> 13:34.000
I thought he went for a
walk? I thought he was back!

13:34.084 --> 13:35.417
[PUAR] Hey, I know!

13:35.500 --> 13:37.667
Let's go outside
and look for him!

13:37.750 --> 13:40.959
There's something I wanna
show you out there, anyway.

13:41.042 --> 13:42.625
Well, um, all right.

13:43.125 --> 13:46.084
[OOLONG muttering]

13:49.292 --> 13:53.042
[PUAR] Looks like Oolong
hasn't come back yet!

13:53.125 --> 13:54.375
[giggling]

13:54.459 --> 13:56.209
[OOLONG] I have a feeling
he's pretty close by!

13:56.292 --> 13:58.959
With her out of the way,
nothing can stop me!

13:59.042 --> 14:02.209
Strange, though. In the daylight
she seemed much prettier...

14:02.667 --> 14:05.625
[GOKU snoring]

14:09.709 --> 14:10.667
[YAMCHA] Ah-ha!

14:13.709 --> 14:16.667
I betcha I know what's
under here: Dragon Balls!

14:19.250 --> 14:22.209
Odd. They seem...
kinda flimsy...

14:26.584 --> 14:29.292
I'm freezing!
What do you want to show me?!

14:29.375 --> 14:34.500
It's right up here.
Now, watch real close!

14:34.584 --> 14:35.500
What in the world?!

14:35.584 --> 14:36.542
Tricked you good, huh?

14:38.625 --> 14:39.959
You wanna make a bet?!

14:40.042 --> 14:41.042
Oolong?! But--!

14:42.959 --> 14:46.834
[screaming]

14:46.917 --> 14:48.042
Master!

14:48.125 --> 14:49.875
Come back here!

14:49.959 --> 14:53.917
[whimpering]

14:57.084 --> 14:58.667
Are you okay?!

14:59.625 --> 15:04.250
Not... Dragon Balls...
Not... Dragon Balls...

15:04.334 --> 15:05.709
My poor master!

15:07.042 --> 15:09.334
[OOLONG] Hey!
Where are you?!

15:09.417 --> 15:12.709
[PUAR] Come on, Yamcha!
Let's go! Come on, come on!

15:12.792 --> 15:18.584
[YAMCHA] Not... Dragon Balls...
Not... Dragon Balls...

15:18.667 --> 15:21.709
It's like a thieves
convention here!

15:21.792 --> 15:27.792
[birds cawing]

15:31.625 --> 15:33.167
[GOKU yawning]

15:33.250 --> 15:34.500
It's about time.

15:34.584 --> 15:36.667
Oh, good morning.

15:36.750 --> 15:40.584
Yeah, for you, maybe.
Nice sleep?

15:40.667 --> 15:41.625
Huh?

15:41.959 --> 15:45.125
Oh... I have a
terrible headache...

15:45.209 --> 15:48.875
Hey, Oolong, did you
get my clothes clean yet?

15:48.959 --> 15:51.417
Sorry, I've been a little busy.

15:51.500 --> 15:55.334
What?! What do you mean 'busy'?!
This is serious!

15:55.417 --> 15:57.167
I don't have any
clothes to wear!

15:57.250 --> 16:00.834
I mean busy saving
your hides from Yamcha.

16:00.917 --> 16:01.875
Yamcha?

16:03.375 --> 16:05.792
[BULMA] Wow, he came back!

16:05.875 --> 16:09.542
Were you nice to him?
Yamcha's real shy, you know?

16:09.625 --> 16:11.792
I think I'm gonna puke.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.459
What did you say?!

16:13.542 --> 16:16.334
Nothing.
And if you really need clothes,

16:16.417 --> 16:18.875
there's one outfit in
the drawer upstairs.

16:18.959 --> 16:21.542
Why didn't you just
say so in the first place?!

16:21.625 --> 16:22.959
Hmph!

16:23.042 --> 16:26.000
Yeah. come to think of it,
maybe three-hundred girls

16:26.084 --> 16:28.042
is a few too many, little buddy.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
[GOKU] So, does that mean
you're changing your mind

16:31.584 --> 16:32.542
about the harem thing?

16:32.625 --> 16:33.625
[OOLONG] Yup!

16:33.709 --> 16:36.250
Gee, you sure are one smart pig,
Oolong.

16:40.625 --> 16:41.584
[stomach growling]

16:41.667 --> 16:43.042
I'm hungry.

16:44.250 --> 16:47.084
You are always hungry, kid.

16:48.625 --> 16:52.167
[beeping]

16:52.250 --> 16:54.542
[PILAF] What?! You
two failed me again?!

16:54.625 --> 16:57.709
Next time I'll know
better than to get my spies

16:57.792 --> 16:59.375
from the want ads!

16:59.459 --> 17:02.292
Sorry, sir. But we've
already reprogrammed the bomb.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.000
It's set to blow at eight.

17:04.084 --> 17:05.916
What? At eight?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.250
[PILAF] Why, that's
just an hour away.

17:08.334 --> 17:10.666
All right, but no more mistakes!

17:10.750 --> 17:12.834
[MAI] Yes, sir.
Agent Mai out.

17:12.916 --> 17:15.541
[chomping]

17:15.625 --> 17:18.584
A month's supply of food gone!

17:18.666 --> 17:20.834
Hey, what's this? Easter?!

17:20.916 --> 17:23.709
This is no outfit,
it's a costume!

17:23.791 --> 17:26.084
And I look ridiculous in it,
Oolong!

17:26.166 --> 17:29.167
Well, tough luck!
That's all I've got.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.834
My stock of women's
clothes is down this month.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.709
Hmph. You know, there's
something not quite right

17:34.792 --> 17:37.959
about you, Oolong, but I
just can't quite figure it out.

17:38.042 --> 17:39.375
I'm a pig?

17:39.459 --> 17:42.625
Whew, me too!
Ha ha, that was great!

17:42.709 --> 17:47.000
[engine humming]

17:47.084 --> 17:50.542
[OOLONG] So why am I driving?
I just hate driving!

17:50.625 --> 17:51.959
[BULMA] Oh, quit
your complaining.

17:52.042 --> 17:53.875
I'm putting on my make-up.

17:53.959 --> 17:56.917
Kid, this girl's
a pain in the neck.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.125
Tell me if you see Yamcha.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.459
[tires squealing]

18:06.542 --> 18:09.625
Yeah, we'll keep our
fingers crossed, Bulma.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.500
Oh, can't wait to see him.

18:15.417 --> 18:16.375
Is that him?

18:21.250 --> 18:23.167
[YAMCHA laughing]

18:23.250 --> 18:25.625
Wow!
That Yamcha's such a hunk!

18:27.584 --> 18:29.292
[YAMCHA] Steady Puar.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.334
That's it!

18:31.834 --> 18:34.000
Oh!
He's looking right at me!

18:35.917 --> 18:37.459
Uh-oh.

18:37.542 --> 18:39.625
[BULMA screaming]

18:47.834 --> 18:50.334
What's the big idea?!
Are you two nuts?!

18:51.334 --> 18:53.292
[PUAR] Don't worry
about the girl, master.

18:53.375 --> 18:55.417
I bet she got
knocked out in the crash.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.084
Okay. Game's up.

18:57.167 --> 19:01.042
Listen. Now give me the
Dragon Balls or you will die!

19:01.125 --> 19:02.875
Goku,
how does that goon know

19:02.959 --> 19:03.917
about the Dragon Balls?!

19:05.125 --> 19:07.042
Stop your gawking
and hand them over, now!

19:07.125 --> 19:08.917
I'll hand over this!

19:11.584 --> 19:13.834
Goku, he's got a gun!

19:13.917 --> 19:15.750
I couldn't possibly
turn down a fight

19:15.834 --> 19:18.167
with Gohan's grandson, Puar.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.709
So, you little runt,
you want another spanking

19:20.792 --> 19:22.709
from my Wolf's Fang Fist?!

19:22.792 --> 19:28.750
I was hungry last time,
but now my stomach's full!

19:28.834 --> 19:34.667
[blows landing]

19:35.375 --> 19:37.542
Atta boy!

19:37.625 --> 19:39.417
Have you had enough yet?

19:40.584 --> 19:42.750
Yamcha, let's
get out--Oh no!

19:42.834 --> 19:44.625
Look at your teeth!

19:47.750 --> 19:50.417
[YAMCHA screaming]

19:50.500 --> 19:53.459
[YAMCHA] Oh no, look at me!
Now I'll never get a date!

19:55.250 --> 19:58.792
[YAMCHA] I won't forget
this, kid! I'll be back!

20:00.625 --> 20:02.792
[engine revving]

20:03.542 --> 20:04.417
That was strange.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.125
Wow, Goku!
You were phenomenal!

20:07.209 --> 20:08.750
You really showed him!

20:08.834 --> 20:11.375
Thanks, Oolong.
I think we'd better

20:11.459 --> 20:12.792
go check on Bulma.

20:12.875 --> 20:15.625
[OOLONG] Hope she's in better
shape than our ride...

20:22.625 --> 20:24.417
I guess we
underestimated that kid.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.917
He knows his stuff.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.167
But we can use that
to our advantage, Puar.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.375
We'll just let them find
all of the Dragon Balls.

20:31.459 --> 20:34.459
Then, when they have all
seven, we'll make our strike.

20:34.542 --> 20:38.125
Yamcha, you are the greatest!
You are!

20:39.292 --> 20:42.084
[YAMCHA screaming]

20:44.292 --> 20:46.084
Looks like that
bomb did the trick.

20:46.167 --> 20:49.125
Those poor shmucks
never knew what hit 'em.

20:49.209 --> 20:52.125
That's strange.
It blew before eight o'clock.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.542
Don't worry about it.

20:53.625 --> 20:55.584
Pilaf probably got
those bombs on sale.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.875
[MAI] I'm going to check
inside for the Dragon Balls.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.167
[beeping]

21:03.709 --> 21:05.459
I wonder how
Bulma stayed out of

21:05.542 --> 21:06.792
trouble before she met me.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.375
Hey, why don't you let
me carry her little buddy?

21:09.459 --> 21:11.917
I'd be happy to give
her - er, you a hand.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.875
[chuckling]

21:12.959 --> 21:14.500
[YAMCHA] Hey, you guys!

21:14.584 --> 21:15.542
Over here!

21:16.750 --> 21:20.375
Ah! Look, kid!
It's him!

21:20.459 --> 21:22.042
[YAMCHA] Wait, wait, wait,
wait! Hello there!

21:22.125 --> 21:25.709
We were talking and, uh, oh
well, we really don't want to

21:25.792 --> 21:27.709
have any hard
feelings between us.

21:29.584 --> 21:32.417
Ha, it was a fair
fight, so, here you go!

21:35.792 --> 21:37.459
What's the catch?

21:37.542 --> 21:41.709
There is no catch, my friends.
Goodbye!

21:41.792 --> 21:43.042
Have a good day!

21:44.250 --> 21:46.209
Man. What's up with him?

21:46.292 --> 21:49.542
I guess deep down,
he's really a good guy.

21:49.625 --> 21:52.417
Yeah, bologna.
I don't buy it.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.292
I better check
this thing for bombs.

21:55.375 --> 21:58.459
Sometimes you have
to trust in people.

21:58.542 --> 21:59.709
[OOLONG] Yeah, right.

22:01.167 --> 22:03.459
[beeping]

22:03.542 --> 22:07.417
[PUAR] There they go, Yamcha.
Your homing device is working!

22:09.250 --> 22:11.334
[explosion]

22:14.959 --> 22:17.417
Shu... are we still alive...?

22:17.500 --> 22:19.000
I think so...

22:24.167 --> 22:27.125
[NARRATOR] Even with the odds
stacked against them, our heroes

22:27.209 --> 22:29.959
continue their trek across
the desert in search of the

22:30.042 --> 22:33.042
elusive Dragon Balls.
What perils await them?

22:33.125 --> 22:36.625
[NARRATOR] Will they survive?
