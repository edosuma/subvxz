No way!

<i>You are the best.</i>

01:51.320 --> 01:53.869
Going up against you
was a dream come true.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.119
I look up to you, man.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.168
You're like... you're
like my hero, Rap Bear.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.369
Awesome.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.004
Thank you, Finn.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.674
I thought Billy was your hero.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.926
Yeah, but Billy's dead, so...

02:11.006 --> 02:12.553
Billy.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.681
Ha-ha! Check out these dummies.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.933
Ha-ha! Yeah! You're awesome, Billy!
Ha-ha!

02:17.012 --> 02:19.390
You're gonna pay
for this, Billy!

02:19.473 --> 02:21.441
D'oh!

02:22.559 --> 02:24.982
Aah!

02:26.396 --> 02:27.773
Sick.

02:27.856 --> 02:31.281
Billy!

02:36.531 --> 02:39.284
I love rap music, but
only when it's good rap.

02:39.368 --> 02:42.713
Finn! Finn!

02:42.788 --> 02:45.462
Finn. - Huh? Who that?

02:45.540 --> 02:48.214
I'm Canyon, Billy's
ex-girlfriend.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.921
Say what?! That's so weird.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.223
I was just... Party
Pat was just like...

02:53.298 --> 02:54.971
What's going on here?
Who's that?

02:55.050 --> 02:56.848
This is Billy's ex-girlfriend.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.304
His special lady?

02:58.387 --> 03:00.389
No, his ex-girlfriend.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.769
Aw, man, I'm sorry.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.771
Well, I hope you guys
get back together.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.648
Whoooooop!

03:05.727 --> 03:07.980
Jake's still in
denial about Billy.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.781
Billy and I broke
up four years ago,

03:09.856 --> 03:11.403
but I held on to this.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.236
Billy's loincloth!

03:14.319 --> 03:16.947
After Billy died, I couldn't
keep it in my place anymore.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.703
I heard you guys were friends,

03:18.782 --> 03:21.035
so when I saw your name
on the rap-battle flier,

03:21.118 --> 03:23.997
I thought it would be
cool to bring it to you.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.291
Oh, that's some smelly.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.298
Thank you, Canyon. I guess
I've been in denial, too.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.379
Have you been back
to Billy's Crack?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.260
No. I can't.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.138
It's time to go see
Billy's Crack.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.311
- Shouldn't Jake be here'?
- He needs more time.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.560
This would mess him up too much.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.983
Fairies!

03:45.058 --> 03:47.026
Ohh, they've infested the place.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.230
Okay, you guys, out!

03:49.312 --> 03:51.030
This is Billy's crack.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.699
Billy got aced by the Lich.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.072
We had dibs on the
crack, so beat it!

03:55.152 --> 03:57.871
I'll dib up your brains if you
don't respect the mems of Billy.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.165
Flimsy threats!

04:00.240 --> 04:03.585
Like a tiny blade of grass
in a maelstrom, you are.

04:03.660 --> 04:08.837
That storm is me, Jordan,
lord of the fairies!

04:08.915 --> 04:11.213
I ain't afraid of
you or this big...

04:12.836 --> 04:15.464
You think you can
chump me like that?

04:15.547 --> 04:17.515
This breeze feels great, doofus!

04:20.177 --> 04:22.225
All right.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.103
Laters.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.775
Um, so, Canyon, why did
you and Billy break up?

04:30.854 --> 04:32.572
Huh? Oh.

04:32.647 --> 04:36.151
Well, I loved Billy,
and I believed in him,

04:36.234 --> 04:38.111
but then Billy
stopped believing,

04:38.195 --> 04:40.072
and that jammed up
our whole deal...

04:40.155 --> 04:42.829
Being a top-tier,
red-belt power couple.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.910
After awhile, all he
did was watch movies

04:44.993 --> 04:46.916
and play video games.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.090
Pretty lame, right? So I bailed.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.213
Even heroes have slumps, bro.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.967
Yeah, I know. I heard he was
making a comeback, too.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.799
What a weird world.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.805
Hyah!

05:00.884 --> 05:02.932
Billy!

05:04.596 --> 05:06.940
What the...

05:07.015 --> 05:08.938
What is it?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.815
It looks like Billy's
bucket list.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.647
Whoa! Let me see!

05:13.730 --> 05:15.698
Hmm.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.742
Looks like he got
to most of these.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.741
He sure lived a full life.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.822
Okay, here's one. Wait.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.828
"Tell Finn that thing."

05:23.907 --> 05:26.285
What the butt is that?
- I don't know.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.666
Okay, that's gonna
bother me forever.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.840
Well... well, here's one more.
We should do it for Billy.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.167
What's that?

05:36.628 --> 05:38.505
Are you sure you're okay?

05:38.588 --> 05:41.592
Aaaaaaaahh!

05:50.809 --> 05:54.439
Holy shram! Whoo!

06:10.537 --> 06:12.289
That was awesome, Finn.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.125
You know, you remind me of
Billy when he was young.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.835
Whoa.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.886
So, can I see you sometime?

06:18.962 --> 06:22.717
I have a feeling our
paths will cross again.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.517
Take care, Finn.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.524
"Take Canyon on one
last ride." Whoops.

06:38.607 --> 06:39.608
Unh.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.078
What? Another item?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.905
You sneaky Billy.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.038
"Lie on my back in the ocean."

06:49.117 --> 06:50.164
Cool.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.587
Why the ocean, Billy?!

07:00.712 --> 07:02.885
Okay, Finn, don't think
about your fear.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.932
Just jump in there
like it's no biggie.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.510
Do it for Billy.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.220
For Billy!

07:13.266 --> 07:15.519
I'm afraid. I'm afraid!

07:15.602 --> 07:17.070
Oh, dang. Here he comes!

07:17.145 --> 07:18.647
Here comes the fear feaster!

07:23.818 --> 07:27.493
Way to go, Finn the coward.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.246
Still afraid of the ocean, eh?

07:33.578 --> 07:35.080
You should just give up!

07:35.163 --> 07:37.131
You're not a hero.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.925
You're a wimp-o!

07:39.000 --> 07:41.549
A cringing, cowardly...

07:41.628 --> 07:43.551
Hey, where you going'?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.473
Fool, I come with.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.346
Ha-ha!

07:47.425 --> 07:51.020
I'm gonna nosh on
your insecurities.

07:51.096 --> 07:56.899
Then I'll... I'll
squat on your hopes.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.026
So, now what, little boy?

08:00.105 --> 08:01.105
Huh?

08:01.147 --> 08:05.118
Uh, hey, man, don't
do anything stupid.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.820
Hey!

08:06.903 --> 08:09.827
You're too chicken to face
your fears with open eyes?

08:09.906 --> 08:11.624
This stank is cheating!

08:11.700 --> 08:14.078
This stank is for Billy.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.997
No!

09:00.081 --> 09:01.298
Aah!

09:05.545 --> 09:08.139
Aaaaaaaaaaahh!

09:22.312 --> 09:24.906
For Billy!

09:26.691 --> 09:29.535
Wake up.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.909
Wake up!

09:37.535 --> 09:39.833
Huh? Whoa!

09:40.997 --> 09:44.422
No mortal blade can harm...

09:44.501 --> 09:45.548
What?!

09:52.175 --> 09:54.348
Was that you, or me?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.645
Huh? Hey.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.851
Hey. I-I'm doing it!

10:00.934 --> 10:05.235
I'm not afraid of
the ocean anymore!

10:05.313 --> 10:08.943
I'm doing it, Billy. - Billy!

10:11.111 --> 10:12.784
You finished my list.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.115
Now I can rest
like a great hero.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.871
Thank you, Finn.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.419
You're welcome.
Canyon helped, too.

10:19.494 --> 10:22.418
Tell Canyon I watch her sleep.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.421
Man, love is weird, Finn.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.094
I know.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.887
Is that the thing you
wanted to tell me?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.512
No. Goodbye.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.388
Wait. Billy!

10:34.467 --> 10:35.639
What?

10:35.718 --> 10:37.238
What's the thing you
wanted to tell me?

10:37.303 --> 10:40.728
Oh, uh, you must
go to the Citadel.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.559
That's where your father is.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.145
Joshua's not alive. Me and
Jake buried him behind the...

10:45.228 --> 10:47.071
Not Joshua!

10:47.147 --> 10:49.400
<i>Your other dad... Dad the Human.</i>

10:49.482 --> 10:50.825
What?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.653
Your father, Finn. He's alive.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.740
He's alive.
