01:00.292 --> 01:01.627
Hi, this is MacGyver.

01:01.627 --> 01:08.008
We all know how these things work,
so when you hear the beep... go for it.

01:08.008 --> 01:12.262
MacGyver, pick up if you're there.
You ever heard of staying home?

01:12.262 --> 01:14.765
Never mind.
This is your good buddy, Jack.

01:14.765 --> 01:18.018
I've got myself into just
a touch of trouble down here

01:18.018 --> 01:19.812
in Bayonne County, Arkansas.

01:19.812 --> 01:22.523
A little hoedown town called Smiley.

01:22.523 --> 01:26.276
It's more than a touch of trouble.
I outdone myself this time.

01:26.276 --> 01:31.114
I need your help. If you ever
wanna see any of that money I owe you...

01:31.114 --> 01:34.493
Mac, I gotta go.
They're comin' for me.

01:34.493 --> 01:37.788
Oh, God, Mac. Get here.
You got to come get me.

01:37.788 --> 01:40.415
I... Help! No!

02:01.394 --> 02:05.273
Louella. Fair Louella.

02:07.275 --> 02:09.610
What do I owe thee
for thy grits and gravy?

02:09.610 --> 02:14.532
Why, Mr Dalton, a trip to Hollywood
should just about cover everything.

02:14.532 --> 02:17.994
- Everything?
- Anything.

02:20.330 --> 02:23.833
Done!
Now how about one for the road?

02:24.834 --> 02:28.838
- Can I have a beer, please?
- Sure, honey.

02:29.756 --> 02:32.592
Getting hot in here, ain't it?

02:32.759 --> 02:36.971
- Don't you think you've had enough?
- No, sirree.

02:36.971 --> 02:39.182
Well, maybe.

02:39.182 --> 02:44.312
But I want more than enough.
Thank you, my sweet. I shall return.

02:44.312 --> 02:47.815
You can't take that beer out of here.

02:55.657 --> 02:58.242
No problem, officer.

02:58.868 --> 03:03.498
Wrong. There is a problem,
and you're it.

03:12.256 --> 03:14.091
Now see what you done?

03:14.091 --> 03:17.220
Destruction of property,
disturbing the peace.

03:17.220 --> 03:19.847
Resisting your ugliness.

03:21.974 --> 03:24.602
Smart mouth, huh?

03:25.895 --> 03:28.522
You're gonna pay, Hollywood.

03:36.280 --> 03:40.409
Oh, boy. Tell me
I enjoyed myself, will you?

03:41.285 --> 03:43.704
- You enjoyed yourself.
- Oh, boy.

03:43.704 --> 03:46.791
Four days on a rowboat with wet pants.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.794
I've got mosquito bites
on top of my mosquito bites.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.463
I thought I was
going to have sunstroke.

03:52.463 --> 03:56.300
Now, coming home,
I smell like old bait.

03:56.467 --> 04:00.054
But you didn't come home
empty handed.

04:00.262 --> 04:01.680
Look at that.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.642
Is that a sweetheart?
You got a camera and some film?

04:04.642 --> 04:06.560
- Yeah.
- We need a picture.

04:06.560 --> 04:07.895
Is this a picture?

04:07.895 --> 04:11.106
- Look! Come on.
- Jeez.

04:15.110 --> 04:18.781
MacGyver, pick up if you're there.
Ever heard of staying home?

04:18.781 --> 04:22.451
Never mind.
This is your good buddy, Jack.

04:22.451 --> 04:25.204
I've got myself into
a touch of trouble down here

04:25.204 --> 04:26.997
in Bayonne County, Arkansas.

04:26.997 --> 04:29.208
- My advice is turn that off.
- Pete...

04:29.208 --> 04:31.668
A little hoedown town called Smiley.

04:31.668 --> 04:35.255
It's more than a touch of trouble.
I outdone myself this time.

04:35.255 --> 04:38.175
- I need your help.
- Why doesn't that surprise me?

04:38.175 --> 04:40.761
If you ever wanna see
any of that money I owe...

04:40.761 --> 04:46.141
Bribery! He's trying to bribe you.
Forget it, tear up the IOU's.

04:46.141 --> 04:48.477
I gotta go.
They're coming for me.

04:48.477 --> 04:50.937
Oh, God. Get here.
You got to come get me.

04:50.937 --> 04:53.774
I... Help! No!

04:56.985 --> 04:59.571
That is a ploy. You know that.

04:59.571 --> 05:04.034
- How do I know that?
- Well, when hasn't it been?

05:04.034 --> 05:06.828
Right. But he does sound
like he's in trouble.

05:06.828 --> 05:11.958
Of course. He's always in trouble.
But he got there by himself.

05:11.958 --> 05:14.794
- Pete, the man's my friend.
- What kind of friend?

05:14.794 --> 05:16.713
When does he call you?

05:16.713 --> 05:19.424
When he wants
to con you into some favour,

05:19.424 --> 05:21.551
or he needs you to rescue him.

05:21.551 --> 05:23.720
He's always getting you in trouble.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.639
How long are you gonna
baby-sit for this guy?

05:26.639 --> 05:29.768
All right. I get the point.

05:29.934 --> 05:32.228
And you're right.

05:32.228 --> 05:34.981
I'm not gonna be sucked in
by him this time.

05:34.981 --> 05:37.108
He's on his own.

05:37.108 --> 05:39.944
- I'm not going.
- Well, good.

05:41.070 --> 05:44.949
My grandpa used to say that
friendship was a two-sided coin.

05:44.949 --> 05:50.914
It can turn out to be the best
or the worst investment you ever made.

05:50.914 --> 05:54.792
I guess whenever I flipped the coin
of friendship with Jack Dalton,

05:54.792 --> 06:00.590
he usually wound up in over his head,
and I wound up covering his tail.

06:00.590 --> 06:03.426
To refuse Jack's call for help
was useless.

06:03.426 --> 06:06.637
If I did, I'd just end up
feeling guilty the rest of my life

06:06.637 --> 06:08.806
if anything bad happened to him.

06:08.806 --> 06:12.685
And aside from guilt,
there was always the curiosity factor.

06:12.685 --> 06:14.645
This time, the question being,

06:14.645 --> 06:21.777
"What on earth brought a man about town
like Jack Dalton to Smiley, Arkansas?"

06:38.294 --> 06:40.880
Howdy.

06:42.214 --> 06:44.467
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

06:44.467 --> 06:48.053
His name's Jack Dalton.
He's not from around these parts.

06:48.053 --> 06:53.434
You probably don't know him,
but that's a picture of him.

06:56.103 --> 06:58.731
Haven't seen him, huh?

07:01.108 --> 07:04.445
This is Smiley, Arkansas, isn't it?

07:12.369 --> 07:13.996
Thought so.

07:13.996 --> 07:16.582
Just checking.

07:37.269 --> 07:39.646
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

07:39.646 --> 07:42.024
- Do you have any juice?
- Lemonade.

07:42.024 --> 07:45.027
I squeezed it fresh this morning.

07:45.277 --> 07:48.488
- That'll be fine.
- Anything else?

07:48.488 --> 07:52.617
As a matter of fact,
I'm looking for a friend.

07:52.617 --> 07:54.453
Jack Dalton?

07:54.453 --> 07:56.997
- You a friend of Jack Dalton?
- Yeah.

07:56.997 --> 07:58.999
- From Hollywood?
- I'm not...

07:58.999 --> 08:02.127
From the Dalton Agency?
Well you find him for me.

08:02.127 --> 08:05.380
That man's my ticket
out of this one-horse town.

08:05.380 --> 08:08.633
I'm gonna be a model.
I'm gonna be on TV.

08:08.633 --> 08:12.470
Louella, the man wants lemonade,
not your résumé.

08:12.470 --> 08:15.140
Lyle, you're such a poo.

08:18.143 --> 08:19.603
If Louella runs off,

08:19.603 --> 08:22.606
this town's gonna lose
its only worthwhile exhibit.

08:22.606 --> 08:24.733
Lyle Hudson, your friendly banker.

08:24.733 --> 08:27.485
- Matter of fact, your only banker.
- MacGyver.

08:27.485 --> 08:31.781
You know, your friend Dalton, he had
a penchant for getting in trouble here.

08:31.781 --> 08:34.409
Jack? You've seen Jack?

08:35.118 --> 08:37.412
What'd he do?

08:37.412 --> 08:40.539
Let's just say he ruffled
some of the wrong feathers.

08:40.539 --> 08:42.375
If you stick around long enough

08:42.375 --> 08:45.253
you may notice that most
of the citizens in Smiley

08:45.253 --> 08:47.630
have this redneck view of things.

08:47.630 --> 08:50.091
Somebody as flamboyant
as your friend,

08:50.091 --> 08:52.218
he makes 'em see
a little bit redder.

08:52.218 --> 08:56.764
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah. What happened to him?

08:57.015 --> 08:59.601
Got on the wrong side of Bull Bodine.

08:59.601 --> 09:02.687
That's the local sheriff.
Very unforgiving man.

09:02.687 --> 09:05.940
Ran him through that window
then ran him out of town.

09:05.940 --> 09:10.737
He's probably licking his wounds in
Little Rock. That's where they all go.

09:10.737 --> 09:13.364
Little Rock?

09:14.032 --> 09:16.868
Guess that's where I'm headed.

09:17.326 --> 09:19.662
Thank you for the lemonade.

09:19.662 --> 09:21.414
You be good now, you hear?

09:21.414 --> 09:24.041
Yes, ma'am.

09:35.344 --> 09:38.723
Understand you're looking
for Jack Dalton.

09:38.723 --> 09:41.309
Word travels fast.

09:41.851 --> 09:44.061
You come to the wrong place.

09:44.061 --> 09:47.064
Yeah, apparently he did too, huh?

09:47.648 --> 09:49.775
You another smart mouth?

09:49.775 --> 09:52.611
Somebody should've taught
your friend manners.

09:52.611 --> 09:54.989
I guess we gotta beat it
into you city boys.

09:54.989 --> 09:59.827
I didn't come looking for a hassle.
I came here looking for a friend.

09:59.827 --> 10:05.040
Are you saying I'm harassing you?
Just who are you to accuse me?

10:05.040 --> 10:07.001
Look, just forget it, okay?

10:07.001 --> 10:11.130
Don't you walk away from me, boy!
That's resisting arrest.

10:11.130 --> 10:13.424
- What?!
- Resisting arrest,

10:13.424 --> 10:17.553
making a public nuisance of yourself,
and carrying a concealed weapon.

10:17.553 --> 10:20.472
Concealed weapon?
That's a Swiss Army Knife!

10:20.472 --> 10:23.100
Can't you lighten up...?

10:27.271 --> 10:29.481
Welcome to Smiley, boy.

10:29.481 --> 10:33.861
I got a real nice place for you
to be staying.

11:12.816 --> 11:16.736
All right, you two, give me a hand
and get these guys out of here. Move!

11:16.736 --> 11:19.322
Come on, you.

11:27.872 --> 11:30.500
You two, unload that stuff.

11:34.254 --> 11:36.840
Want to hand it down?

11:43.221 --> 11:46.099
Hey, amigos, don't look so sad.

11:46.099 --> 11:49.811
If you like bad food and hard work,
you're in the right place.

11:49.811 --> 11:52.438
Knock it off, Sanchez.

11:53.231 --> 11:56.150
All right, all of you, come on.

12:02.031 --> 12:04.033
That's it.

12:04.033 --> 12:06.619
Warden!

12:11.291 --> 12:13.501
I'm Warden Renfro.

12:13.501 --> 12:15.837
I'm the law around here.

12:15.837 --> 12:20.675
If you wish to remain alive
you'll abide by that law.

12:20.675 --> 12:22.468
If you cause any dissension,

12:22.468 --> 12:27.014
you will undergo an attitude
adjustment in the sweatbox.

12:27.014 --> 12:30.017
You keep them rakes moving, boys.

12:30.268 --> 12:32.019
If you loaf on the job,

12:32.019 --> 12:35.147
you'll be whipped back into shape.

12:36.065 --> 12:39.652
I wouldn't recommend
any attempt to escape.

12:39.652 --> 12:43.030
You may try, if you wish.

12:43.197 --> 12:47.743
Personally, I would shy away
from tunnelling under that fence...

12:47.743 --> 12:50.538
...because if you do,
my dogs will hunt you down,

12:50.538 --> 12:53.290
chew you up and spit you out.

12:55.459 --> 12:58.254
Over there, that's worse.

12:58.421 --> 13:01.549
Got myself a swamp full of gators.

13:02.049 --> 13:05.219
They're real agitated
'cause we keep them hungry.

13:05.219 --> 13:10.057
If you want to go for a swim,
we can't stop you...

13:10.099 --> 13:12.685
...but they will.

13:14.436 --> 13:15.980
That's all.

13:15.980 --> 13:18.607
Move out.

13:18.857 --> 13:22.236
Come, Pepe will show you
where we eat, where we sleep...

13:22.236 --> 13:24.697
Where we curse the guards.

13:24.697 --> 13:28.325
Hey, Pepe,
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

13:28.325 --> 13:31.328
In this place? You are
a very good friend then.

13:31.328 --> 13:33.706
Yeah, his name's Dalton.
Jack Dalton.

13:33.706 --> 13:37.376
This Sheriff Bodine
gave him a hard time.

13:37.376 --> 13:41.130
- I think he's been thrown in here.
- No, there's no Dalton in here.

13:41.130 --> 13:42.506
I know that.

13:42.506 --> 13:46.009
Wait a minute.
There was a Jack here.

13:46.176 --> 13:49.304
But he was killed a few days ago.

14:10.867 --> 14:13.495
Aw, Jack.

14:21.586 --> 14:25.924
- How'd it happen?
- Deputy Bodine, El Toro Loco.

14:25.924 --> 14:28.635
This Yankee and him,
they were having a fight.

14:28.635 --> 14:34.474
Then when he tried to run away,
El Toro Loco shot him in the back.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.476
Bodine.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.937
Time!

14:38.937 --> 14:40.397
Time's up!

14:40.397 --> 14:42.148
Hey!

14:42.148 --> 14:44.275
My 1 2 hours are up.

14:44.275 --> 14:46.861
It's over!

14:46.903 --> 14:49.572
I'm out of the penalty box.

14:49.739 --> 14:52.283
Can any of you rubes tell time?

14:52.283 --> 14:54.869
Hey!

14:58.790 --> 15:01.376
Get out.

15:11.094 --> 15:12.345
Jack!

15:12.345 --> 15:14.555
Hey, hey, compadre!

15:14.555 --> 15:16.641
Welcome to Club Dread.

15:16.641 --> 15:19.644
The Chief?
He's your friend Jack Dalton?

15:19.644 --> 15:21.104
Chief?

15:21.104 --> 15:23.189
Who is JD?

15:23.189 --> 15:25.775
Don't know.
John Doe, John Dead.

15:25.775 --> 15:28.778
Let's get back to the living.
You met my amigo Pepe?

15:28.778 --> 15:31.989
Kid worships the ground I hobble on.
Can't say I blame him.

15:31.989 --> 15:35.618
- I thought you were dead.
- A premature assumption, old buddy.

15:35.618 --> 15:37.954
Glad you could make it.

15:37.954 --> 15:41.624
Jack, we gotta get out of here.

15:41.791 --> 15:45.878
Don't sweat it.
I got the lay of the land.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.839
Let's do lunch.

15:54.595 --> 15:58.140
You're with the Chief.
You don't have to eat that slop.

15:58.140 --> 16:01.227
Keep it, Wrigley,
we're dining out this evening.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.104
The VIP suite.

16:03.104 --> 16:06.440
We like to think of it
as home sweet home.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.026
You bunk there.

16:17.409 --> 16:21.747
All right, Jack, start talking.
You're way too happy in this hellhole.

16:21.747 --> 16:24.541
You haven't even tried to escape.
Why?

16:24.541 --> 16:28.253
Come on, escape is your specialty.
I got us in. You get us out.

16:28.253 --> 16:32.549
- What a team. What a plan.
- Plan? What plan?

16:33.384 --> 16:38.305
The plan I have to recover
the missing millions of B.B. Bartel.

16:38.305 --> 16:40.516
B.B...?

16:40.516 --> 16:42.684
B.B. Bartel, the bank robber?

16:42.684 --> 16:46.355
Exactamundo. Remember after that
airport armoured car heist?

16:46.355 --> 16:50.484
He took a flight to the Deep South,
bailed out with 5 million.

16:50.484 --> 16:52.903
- I don't want to hear this.
- Here we go.

16:52.903 --> 16:55.447
Eat while it's cold,
the story gets better.

16:55.447 --> 16:57.533
See, they never found the money.

16:57.533 --> 17:00.869
Bartel was arrested later in Nebraska.
He wouldn't talk,

17:00.869 --> 17:03.997
so they threw the book at him.
He died in a penitentiary.

17:03.997 --> 17:07.291
- It's good, huh?
- Yeah.

17:07.459 --> 17:10.837
Right from the warden's
private henhouse.

17:10.837 --> 17:13.799
Anyway, old B.B.
was from Bayonne County.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.300
Yep, right here.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.637
And he hid the money
in that zinc mine across the river.

17:19.637 --> 17:21.306
How do you know all this?

17:21.306 --> 17:24.601
- My Uncle Charlie.
- Uncle Charlie?

17:24.768 --> 17:27.854
The man used to rob your piggy bank.
He's an ex-con!

17:27.854 --> 17:31.024
That's not to say his past
hasn't worked to my advantage.

17:31.024 --> 17:35.195
Au contraire, mon ami. You see, B.B.
Bartel and Uncle Charlie were close.

17:35.195 --> 17:38.156
Very close.
They shared a cell at Leavenworth.

17:38.156 --> 17:41.534
B.B. told Uncle Charlie
where the money was before he died.

17:41.534 --> 17:43.453
And you believed him.

17:43.453 --> 17:48.291
Just out of curiosity,
where is dear old Uncle Charlie now?

17:48.291 --> 17:50.460
He was supposed
to meet me down here.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.797
My suspicion is he bailed out
when he saw the competition,

17:53.797 --> 17:56.382
Warden Renfro and his boys.

17:56.508 --> 18:00.470
This is supposed to be
a prison work farm?

18:01.346 --> 18:05.099
We're not farming. We're mining.

18:05.266 --> 18:09.062
They're using us as slave labour
to dig in the mine for that money.

18:09.062 --> 18:12.232
- Can you believe it?
- No, I can't.

18:12.232 --> 18:15.485
Don't know how they found out
about it. Doesn't make sense.

18:15.485 --> 18:18.279
None of it does, Jack!

18:18.446 --> 18:23.076
Just so I got this straight.
You got yourself arrested on purpose.

18:23.076 --> 18:26.621
You conned me into coming here
to help you find stolen money

18:26.621 --> 18:29.165
- and then help you break out?
- Exactly.

18:29.165 --> 18:30.875
We're partners, partner.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.418
You did it to me again.

18:32.418 --> 18:35.254
You actually... He did it.
He did it to me again.

18:35.254 --> 18:37.215
You'll get your cut.
So will Pepe.

18:37.215 --> 18:40.301
There's a 1 5 percent reward
for the return of the money.

18:40.301 --> 18:42.970
I don't give a rat's pyjamas
about the money!

18:42.970 --> 18:47.099
We're gonna get out of here, and
when we do, we're through. That's it!

18:47.099 --> 18:50.728
This is the last wild-goose chase
you're ever gonna take me on.

18:50.728 --> 18:53.689
Wild goose chase?
Pardonnez-moi.

18:54.941 --> 18:57.526
What wild-goose chase?

18:57.818 --> 19:00.446
Uncle Charlie gave me a map.

19:05.326 --> 19:07.953
X marks the spot.

19:44.740 --> 19:49.203
Get your tails on up to the shaft
and grab your gear. Let's move it.

19:49.203 --> 19:53.165
You! Don't try sneaking off looking
for another place to take a nap,

19:53.165 --> 19:56.793
or you'll get something worse
than the hot box. Is that clear?

19:56.793 --> 19:59.046
Painfully clear.
Thank you, sir.

19:59.046 --> 20:01.298
Come on, keep moving!

20:01.298 --> 20:03.800
He's a pussycat, really.

20:03.800 --> 20:07.846
- All the guards around here are.
- Will you come back to the real world?

20:07.846 --> 20:10.515
They are not pussycats.
They're dangerous.

20:10.515 --> 20:15.312
No pain, no gain.
There's gold in them there hills!

20:16.021 --> 20:18.607
Keep moving.

20:38.960 --> 20:42.756
Wrigley, something
in a hard hat, please.

21:08.156 --> 21:10.742
Comin' through.

21:18.917 --> 21:21.544
Warden Renfro hasn't got
a clue where to look.

21:21.544 --> 21:24.881
The map says B.B.'s money
is hidden two shafts over.

21:24.881 --> 21:27.800
We gotta create a diversion
and hightail it there.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.720
- That's where you come in.
- That's where I bow out.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.556
I'm not gonna risk your life,
Pepe's or mine

21:33.556 --> 21:36.225
- over some dead man's money.
- Come on...

21:36.225 --> 21:41.564
- You come on! With me! Out of here!
- I'm not going. Not without the money.

21:41.564 --> 21:43.816
Suit yourself. I'm gone.

21:43.816 --> 21:46.611
Fine. Why don't you just
kill me right here.

21:46.611 --> 21:49.614
Bash in my skull,
save them the trouble.

21:49.614 --> 21:51.532
Oh, will you get serious?

21:51.532 --> 21:53.409
All I wanna do is follow my dream.

21:53.409 --> 21:56.162
You're the one that
screwed it up the last time.

21:56.162 --> 22:00.333
- What are you talking about?
- Dalton Airways, that's what.

22:00.333 --> 22:03.419
I finally got a plane.
I got it going.

22:03.419 --> 22:05.379
What happened, do you remember?

22:05.379 --> 22:08.507
Huh? Self-sacrifice.
That's what happened.

22:08.507 --> 22:11.469
I flew it to Central America,
parked it in the Pacific

22:11.469 --> 22:14.430
- to get you out of a jam, remember?
- Of course I...

22:14.430 --> 22:18.601
That was the beginning of my dream.
Now I have a chance to start it over.

22:18.601 --> 22:21.687
The reward will give birth
to Dalton Airways again.

22:21.687 --> 22:23.481
Come on. Help me.

22:23.481 --> 22:27.234
It's legal. Nobody gets hurt.
Be a pal.

22:35.743 --> 22:37.786
What do you want me to do?

22:37.786 --> 22:43.876
Well, a little diversion to get us
into portal six would be great.

22:47.004 --> 22:49.798
These lamps work on
a chemical reaction.

22:49.798 --> 22:52.718
I'm gonna need a whole bunch.
Get as many as you can.

22:52.718 --> 22:55.220
Done. What'd I tell you?
We're rolling now.

22:55.220 --> 23:00.476
Get the lamp and the liner out
and fill them with water.

23:00.601 --> 23:04.188
- Where you going?
- Need more helmets.

23:07.065 --> 23:10.444
Darn things keep running out of fuel.

23:26.918 --> 23:31.381
Give 'em a few more days
on tunnel four before we start on five.

23:31.381 --> 23:35.469
I want it picked clean.
That money is in one of those shafts.

23:35.469 --> 23:39.055
Mine's been condemned a long time.
Makes the going dangerous.

23:39.055 --> 23:41.766
It's no problem.
Just gives us a good excuse

23:41.766 --> 23:46.438
for burying the ones that
eventually find the money for us.

23:46.438 --> 23:49.566
One unfortunate accident,

23:49.733 --> 23:52.402
and we got no witnesses.

23:59.951 --> 24:02.829
You know, I don't understand
what I'm doing,

24:02.829 --> 24:05.874
but as long as you do,
MacGyver, we're fine.

24:05.874 --> 24:09.210
It's an illusion, Pepe.
We're gonna make our own gas leak

24:09.210 --> 24:12.547
with the same chemical reaction
that lights these lamps.

24:12.547 --> 24:16.134
It's not harmful,
but it is effective.

24:17.260 --> 24:22.473
When you mix the carbide with water,
it creates a gas called acetylene.

24:22.473 --> 24:25.310
You mean like they use
in a welding torch?

24:25.310 --> 24:27.604
You got it.

24:27.604 --> 24:29.606
Now my idea is to tape this flint

24:29.606 --> 24:31.232
to the head of the hammer,

24:31.232 --> 24:34.360
build a good thick cloud of gas...

24:34.652 --> 24:38.322
...make it spark, and we're on our way.

24:38.406 --> 24:41.117
Great. Then we'll be free.

24:41.284 --> 24:43.077
And rich.

24:43.077 --> 24:45.037
So I can go home, to my Rosa.

24:45.037 --> 24:46.873
Is she your wife?

24:46.873 --> 24:49.208
No... not yet.

24:49.208 --> 24:52.587
See, her family,
they don't want her to marry me.

24:52.587 --> 24:55.214
They say I'm a nobody.

24:55.423 --> 25:00.636
They want her to marry a somebody,
like you. Like the Chief.

25:00.636 --> 25:02.722
The Chief.

25:02.722 --> 25:04.599
He's special, all right.

25:04.599 --> 25:08.936
He's gonna need special
intensive care when we get out.

25:08.936 --> 25:11.314
Here we are, gentlemen.

25:11.314 --> 25:13.274
- Hard hats, anyone?
- Great.

25:13.274 --> 25:15.901
Get the lamps off.

25:16.402 --> 25:18.988
Fill those with water.

25:32.042 --> 25:34.545
- We in business?
- We're doing all right.

25:34.545 --> 25:37.798
Just one thing: I don't want Pepe
going into portal six.

25:37.798 --> 25:41.510
- It could be dangerous.
- No, I'm with you all the way, guys.

25:41.510 --> 25:43.262
- I can help.
- You bet you can.

25:43.262 --> 25:46.640
We need somebody to spread
the word there's a gas leak.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.727
But when you find the money,
you have to escape, no?

25:49.727 --> 25:52.938
- You can't leave me behind.
- It won't be for long, buddy.

25:52.938 --> 25:56.692
We'll get the National Guard to come,
nail them and get you out.

25:56.692 --> 25:58.902
Pepe...

25:58.902 --> 26:02.197
...it's the best way.
We need you.

26:03.866 --> 26:06.452
- Okay.
- Good man.

26:06.452 --> 26:09.037
All right, here we go.

26:13.917 --> 26:15.377
Brilliant.

26:15.377 --> 26:20.215
I don't know what you're doing,
but it's brilliant.

26:21.883 --> 26:24.469
Pepe, take off.

26:26.096 --> 26:29.474
- Am I missing something?
- If this thing blows like it should,

26:29.474 --> 26:32.185
I won't have time to go into
what you're missing.

26:32.185 --> 26:34.604
- Just get ready to run.
- Ready.

26:34.604 --> 26:37.858
Gas! Gas!

26:44.322 --> 26:46.908
Go!

26:50.203 --> 26:52.831
Gas! Gas!

26:58.670 --> 27:00.422
What the hell's going on?

27:00.422 --> 27:04.801
- Gas! There's a gas leak in the mine!
- There's a gas leak down there.

27:04.801 --> 27:07.429
You men line up now!

27:08.388 --> 27:13.518
Get a head count on those prisoners!
Keep them together!

27:18.523 --> 27:22.318
- Now you boys stay right here.
- Bodine.

27:23.278 --> 27:25.864
Got him.

27:25.864 --> 27:28.449
No!

27:38.710 --> 27:41.713
Back it up.
Get back. Get back.

27:42.672 --> 27:45.299
Chief...

27:58.354 --> 28:00.606
This is what happens...

28:00.606 --> 28:03.985
...when somebody tries to escape.

28:05.444 --> 28:08.864
I hope you all can see
the lesson in this.

28:08.864 --> 28:14.203
Any more of you want to try,
I can always use the practice.

28:14.203 --> 28:16.831
Jack!

28:21.711 --> 28:26.924
- I guess you wanna keep Pepe company.
- Hold it, Bodine.

28:27.633 --> 28:32.847
Blowing this malcontent away
would be too quick a lesson.

28:34.098 --> 28:35.683
Oh, man.

28:35.683 --> 28:40.020
What this man needs
is some serious discipline.

28:51.448 --> 28:54.034
The man has no forehand.

28:54.576 --> 28:56.245
Concentrate.

28:56.245 --> 28:59.623
Use more wrist. Step into it.

29:02.292 --> 29:04.878
How's that, funny boy?

29:04.920 --> 29:06.922
Better.

29:06.922 --> 29:09.258
Let's see, where were we?

29:09.258 --> 29:12.386
- Oh, right, ten.
- Nine.

29:16.265 --> 29:18.892
Ten.

29:19.476 --> 29:22.062
With my compliments.

29:30.112 --> 29:32.864
Isn't this a crying shame?

29:33.031 --> 29:35.492
But this is what happens
when a prisoner

29:35.492 --> 29:39.788
forms a hostile
and disrespectful attitude.

29:39.955 --> 29:43.125
I hate to see it...

29:43.291 --> 29:46.545
...and I know
you'd hate to feel it.

29:46.545 --> 29:49.172
Just ask Mr Dalton.

29:53.593 --> 29:56.179
Cut him down.

30:02.978 --> 30:04.729
Take care of your friend.

30:04.729 --> 30:06.815
See he keeps his nose clean.

30:06.815 --> 30:09.317
Help me get him back
to the barracks.

30:09.317 --> 30:11.987
I got him. Easy, easy.

30:38.763 --> 30:41.099
It's not right.

30:41.099 --> 30:43.726
Pepe was harmless.

30:43.810 --> 30:46.354
He'd be alive if he
hadn't listened to me.

30:46.354 --> 30:50.358
Jack... you did not shoot Pepe.

30:50.525 --> 30:53.152
Bodine did.

30:54.237 --> 30:57.990
I might as well
have pulled the trigger.

31:02.036 --> 31:08.668
I wish to hell I'd never heard of
the map, the mine or the $5 million.

31:13.047 --> 31:16.092
Why didn't I just listen to you?

31:17.802 --> 31:20.429
Why start now?

31:26.352 --> 31:30.398
The best thing we can do for Pepe
is get out of this nightmare,

31:30.398 --> 31:33.025
notify the authorities.

31:33.984 --> 31:36.570
I've been thinking about a way out.

31:36.570 --> 31:38.239
You got a plan?

31:38.239 --> 31:41.575
It can wait till morning.

31:41.742 --> 31:44.370
Try to get some sleep.

32:18.362 --> 32:20.989
Jasper.

32:21.323 --> 32:24.034
Yo, Jasper.

32:24.201 --> 32:27.329
I gotta see Bodine and the warden.

32:30.457 --> 32:33.710
What is all this, Wrigley?
It'd better be worth my while.

32:33.710 --> 32:38.006
Dalton and his friend MacGyver,
they're planning to escape.

32:38.006 --> 32:40.467
- Good luck.
- Heard 'em talking last night.

32:40.467 --> 32:42.844
This MacGyver says he's got some plan.

32:42.844 --> 32:47.140
- When will this foolishness transpire?
- Soon. Dalton?

32:47.140 --> 32:49.226
He's real worked up about Pepe.

32:49.226 --> 32:53.271
He said something about forgetting
the mine and the money.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.773
He just wants to bug out.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.692
Money? What money?

32:57.859 --> 32:59.486
I don't rightly know.

32:59.486 --> 33:05.116
I mean, he was just jabbering on
about $5 million and a map.

33:05.784 --> 33:09.079
More of his foolishness, I expect.
Thank you, Wrigley.

33:09.079 --> 33:11.539
I'll see that your diligence
is rewarded.

33:11.539 --> 33:14.834
Get on back to the barracks
before you arouse suspicion.

33:14.834 --> 33:17.462
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

33:23.051 --> 33:26.596
Dalton and his buddy
weren't trying to escape.

33:26.596 --> 33:30.850
That map of theirs must have showed
them the way to B.B. Bartel's money.

33:30.850 --> 33:34.938
Go get 'em.
I've got a phone call to make.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.317
What's going on?

33:39.317 --> 33:41.903
Rise and shine, deadwood.

33:52.997 --> 33:55.583
Step back, husky.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.588
- Move over.
- Yes, sir.

34:01.506 --> 34:04.092
You all heard me.

34:04.425 --> 34:09.096
The warden wants you two
to stop by for breakfast.

34:25.571 --> 34:28.407
What the hell...? How'd you...?

34:35.581 --> 34:38.167
Get the other guards.
We'll hunt 'em down.

34:38.167 --> 34:39.627
I got 'em, sir.

34:39.627 --> 34:42.588
Chain the rest to their bunks
and keep watch.

34:42.588 --> 34:45.216
Yes, sir.

34:51.138 --> 34:54.683
Y'all take the swamp road,
see if the gators have ate them boys.

34:54.683 --> 34:58.020
I want every guard out looking.
Prisoners are shackled.

34:58.020 --> 35:00.564
One man on the gate's plenty.
Move out!

35:00.564 --> 35:02.816
Sir, you got it!

35:02.816 --> 35:05.402
Let's go!

36:11.509 --> 36:16.014
We gotta get to a phone, notify the
authorities, get the state troopers.

36:16.014 --> 36:19.684
Why didn't I think of it before?
Louella! Sweet Louella.

36:19.684 --> 36:23.188
Her place is five miles from here.
She'll help, don't worry.

36:23.188 --> 36:26.608
Why would I worry?
You're her agent.

36:30.278 --> 36:32.906
Hey, you! Stop!

36:53.551 --> 36:56.137
Louella? Sweetheart!

36:56.137 --> 36:58.181
Jack Dalton!

36:58.181 --> 37:01.184
- Well, are you a sight.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

37:01.184 --> 37:04.896
I've come to take you to Hollywood,
but we have to use your phone.

37:04.896 --> 37:08.649
Well, my phone is
temporarily out of order.

37:08.649 --> 37:11.944
No sweat. MacGyver's a crackerjack.
He can fix anything.

37:11.944 --> 37:14.655
'Morning, gentlemen.

37:14.822 --> 37:16.657
Louella, I'm crushed.

37:16.657 --> 37:20.703
I just stopped by this morning
to discuss Louella's line of credit.

37:20.703 --> 37:23.289
Didn't think you were
coming back, Jack.

37:23.289 --> 37:24.832
Wait a minute.

37:24.832 --> 37:27.877
You boys broke out from that
prison camp, didn't you?

37:27.877 --> 37:30.755
You did. That's the warden's car
right there.

37:30.755 --> 37:34.592
We had to. The warden's using prisoners
for slave labour at the mine.

37:34.592 --> 37:38.429
- We wanna notify the authorities.
- Oh, I beg to differ on that.

37:38.429 --> 37:42.016
You see, gentlemen,
I own that mine.

38:12.212 --> 38:14.965
You boys must not have been
raised too good.

38:14.965 --> 38:19.344
Didn't your momma ever teach you it was
impolite to leave without saying bye?

38:19.344 --> 38:21.430
We got a lot of talking to do, son.

38:21.430 --> 38:25.309
You ought to go inside now, Louella.
This is man's business out here.

38:25.309 --> 38:28.312
Anything you say, Lyle.

38:28.479 --> 38:32.399
I'd say you boys got only one chance
to redeem yourselves.

38:32.399 --> 38:34.193
Where is the map?

38:34.193 --> 38:36.528
Come on, Hollywood, sing for me.

38:36.528 --> 38:38.780
I... I...

38:38.780 --> 38:41.366
I got the map.

38:42.576 --> 38:46.788
- Well, then let's have it.
- I got it right up here.

38:46.788 --> 38:50.000
- Do you now?
- Yep.

38:50.167 --> 38:52.836
You boys want to work a deal?

38:52.836 --> 38:59.009
The only place you're gonna work
is the spot where the money is buried.

38:59.009 --> 39:00.635
Bodine?

39:00.635 --> 39:03.388
Get in the back, both of you.

39:10.103 --> 39:12.564
- Why'd you tell 'em?
- To keep us alive.

39:12.564 --> 39:15.191
Grab the bar.

40:00.945 --> 40:03.489
Your memory better be good, boy.

40:03.489 --> 40:06.117
Your life depends on it.

40:18.796 --> 40:21.215
- How much further in?
- Not far.

40:21.215 --> 40:24.427
I can't believe Uncle Charlie
fell in with you clowns.

40:24.427 --> 40:26.929
Well, we came into
the picture kinda late.

40:26.929 --> 40:28.472
Charlie come to the bank,

40:28.472 --> 40:31.475
wanted to talk to Hudson
about getting at the mine.

40:31.475 --> 40:34.312
Hudson pegged him
right away as an ex-con,

40:34.312 --> 40:35.771
I run a make on him,

40:35.771 --> 40:38.816
we find out he'd done time
with B.B. Bartel.

40:38.816 --> 40:41.694
We had a little chat,
and Charlie spilled his guts.

40:41.694 --> 40:44.488
Well, it's a nice, neat
little plan you got here.

40:44.488 --> 40:49.535
Prison labour to find the 5 million,
a banker to launder it.

40:49.535 --> 40:52.830
Well, it's nice to know
you recognize genius

40:52.830 --> 40:54.582
when you see it, boy.

40:54.582 --> 40:59.420
- What happened to Charlie?
- You might say he got cold feet.

40:59.420 --> 41:03.424
You might say he got cold all over.

41:03.591 --> 41:06.260
Your Uncle Charlie died real fast.

41:06.260 --> 41:08.679
You, I'm gonna have
a lot more fun with.

41:08.679 --> 41:11.432
Bodine, let's get on with it.

41:25.571 --> 41:29.032
Well, this is where the map indicated.

41:32.327 --> 41:34.913
X marks the spot!

41:54.599 --> 41:58.520
Well, this is it.
Must be in the mud pit.

41:58.520 --> 42:04.860
Don't just stand there gawking.
Crank that thing up and haul it out.

43:33.114 --> 43:36.325
My, my, ain't that a pretty sight.

43:38.202 --> 43:43.291
We got it. Hot damn, we got it.

43:43.457 --> 43:46.043
Well, boys...

43:47.670 --> 43:50.798
...time for a partin' of the ways.

43:52.842 --> 43:56.262
No point in leaving evidence
around for Ballistics,

43:56.262 --> 43:58.055
I always say.

43:58.055 --> 44:00.808
These fellas escaped,
holed up in the mine,

44:00.808 --> 44:03.686
lit a candle, it turned out
to be a stick of dynamite.

44:03.686 --> 44:06.272
Pitiful, ain't it?

44:06.939 --> 44:09.525
Bodine!

44:21.620 --> 44:24.206
MacGyver, the dynamite!

44:24.915 --> 44:26.458
No, no, no!

44:26.458 --> 44:29.670
Not the money,
not the money! Mac!

44:29.795 --> 44:32.423
Get back!

44:50.816 --> 44:54.778
Five million bucks.

44:56.697 --> 44:59.074
Forget it, Jack.

44:59.074 --> 45:01.660
It's only money.

45:22.013 --> 45:24.975
Well, that's that.

45:25.141 --> 45:27.227
You bet it is.

45:27.227 --> 45:30.021
As soon as I get home,
I'm changing my number.

45:30.021 --> 45:33.483
Come on, don't be like this.
We're partners, compadres,

45:33.483 --> 45:36.820
- a team, like hominy and grits.
- Like gasoline and matches.

45:36.820 --> 45:39.447
I'm moving my houseboat
to an unlisted marina.

45:39.447 --> 45:43.451
- How could you do this to me?
- Do this to you?!

45:43.451 --> 45:47.789
You use me, you lie to me,
you suck me in, you...

45:47.789 --> 45:50.375
...drive me up the wall!

45:51.876 --> 45:54.462
