WEBVTT

00:16.517 --> 00:18.352
They want us to believe
that Vought superheroes

00:18.394 --> 00:20.062
are the only answer. What else
are they lying to us about?

00:20.062 --> 00:21.063
A-Train, you're out.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.648
-Out of what?
-Out of The Seven.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.276
MAEVE: I ended the relationship
when I met you.

00:25.276 --> 00:27.987
Stop fucking lying to me.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.196
And you love her?

00:31.115 --> 00:34.952
We shouldn't feel so calm or
safe. So, what are we gonna do?

00:34.994 --> 00:37.288
Cross our fingers that
Homelander's gonna save us?

00:37.329 --> 00:38.539
I'm the face of The Seven.

00:38.581 --> 00:39.707
I'm just trying to help.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.292
MYRON: Ain't you supposed
to be a hero?

00:41.333 --> 00:42.293
LIBERTY:
I am a hero.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.419
VALERIE:
That's Liberty.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.339
William Butcher?

00:47.381 --> 00:48.883
I found Becca.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.551
BUTCHER: I'm gonna get you
the fuck out of here.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.219
-I'm not leaving.
-Becca, you and me--

00:52.303 --> 00:53.888
-we could disappear.
-I have a son!

00:53.929 --> 00:55.139
He's a fucking Supe freak.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.400
(wind whistling)

01:15.993 --> 01:17.995
Ruby!

01:22.917 --> 01:24.418
(explosion)

01:24.460 --> 01:26.587
(car alarm wailing)

01:26.629 --> 01:28.380
Ruby!

01:28.380 --> 01:30.341
(plane passing overhead)

01:33.010 --> 01:35.179
Here! I'm here!

01:36.514 --> 01:38.557
(Ruby coughs)

01:38.599 --> 01:40.100
(.metallic screeching)

01:41.852 --> 01:44.313
(coughs)

01:45.523 --> 01:47.650
Looks like you saved me, Red.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.360
No, you saved us.

01:49.401 --> 01:52.029
If you hadn't broken
into that DHS mainframe...

01:52.071 --> 01:55.199
True. I am a hell of a hacker...

01:55.241 --> 01:56.951
but I'm no hero.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.662
You are a hero in lots of ways.

01:59.703 --> 02:02.248
What do you mean?

02:04.166 --> 02:07.378
You're not afraid
to live your life.

02:07.419 --> 02:10.047
To be who you really are.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.216
Me, I'm...

02:12.258 --> 02:16.178
I'm afraid to...
to show the world who I am.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.888
Yeah?

02:17.930 --> 02:19.682
So who are you, Maeve?

02:19.723 --> 02:22.226
I'm a lot like you.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.564
I'm gay.

02:28.107 --> 02:30.067
(explosions)

02:30.150 --> 02:32.152
We have to keep moving.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.447
And... cut!

02:35.489 --> 02:36.949
-Brilliant.
-(bell rings)

02:36.991 --> 02:39.243
Yes, that was
absolutely brilliant.

02:39.285 --> 02:40.870
Gang, let's check that.

02:40.911 --> 02:44.331
And, ladies and gents,
it is a wrap for today!

02:44.373 --> 02:45.749
Good job, people.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.751
-That was so great.
-(fire extinguisher spraying)

02:47.793 --> 02:49.753
Let's hit it hard in the a.m.,
people, thank you.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.298
WOMAN:
That's a wrap, people!

02:53.424 --> 02:54.717
Hey, Marty,
play that back, please.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.221
-You enjoying this?
-Yeah.

02:59.263 --> 03:02.808
This new Joss rewrite
really sings, huh?

03:03.893 --> 03:06.020
When are you going to stop
torturing me?

03:06.061 --> 03:08.147
Don't know
what you're talking about.

03:11.233 --> 03:14.445
If I promise
to never see her again,

03:14.486 --> 03:16.780
will you stop?

03:16.822 --> 03:20.326
But, Maeve, you're in love.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.161
It's beautiful.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.329
Elena's good for you,

03:23.370 --> 03:24.705
and I'm not gonna let you
throw that away.

03:24.747 --> 03:27.875
Not now, not ever.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.585
I mean, that would be cruel.

03:29.627 --> 03:30.794
-Can I have a word?
-Come on.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.297
-Sir, please?
-Oh, look at this.

03:33.339 --> 03:37.092
Look at these strong
female lesbians. Hmm?

03:37.134 --> 03:38.510
I'm inspired.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.637
-You inspired?
-Ooh, yeah.

03:39.678 --> 03:40.930
Girls get it on.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.097
Done. Girls get it done.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.182
-They sure do, Ashley.
-In-in private.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.391
Sir, please. It's urgent.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.269
(sighs)

03:47.311 --> 03:50.314
(panicked shouting, screaming)

03:55.110 --> 03:57.696
Ooh...

03:57.738 --> 03:59.365
(screams)

03:59.406 --> 04:01.617
(bystanders screaming)

04:01.659 --> 04:03.202
Ugh.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.496
Terrific!

04:08.207 --> 04:10.626
(woman panting)

04:10.668 --> 04:12.503
(whimpers)

04:12.544 --> 04:15.089
(sobbing)

04:15.130 --> 04:17.216
Oh.

04:18.342 --> 04:19.843
(woman sobbing)

04:22.096 --> 04:23.973
Oh.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.224
(woman continues sobbing)

04:25.265 --> 04:26.934
(scoffs, sputters)

04:26.976 --> 04:28.435
So, what, they're all starving

04:28.477 --> 04:29.770
but one of them's got
a fucking cell phone?

04:29.812 --> 04:30.980
-(chuckles)
-Uh, you know,

04:31.021 --> 04:32.648
I really wish you had
cleared this with me

04:32.690 --> 04:34.984
-before you went over there.
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.986
I don't have to clear shit
with you, Ashley.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.989
I saw a chance for an easy win,
and I took it.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.532
-How many views?
-Well, they posted last night,

04:41.573 --> 04:42.866
we scrubbed it 17 minutes later.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.243
-(sighs)
-But that's forever,

04:44.284 --> 04:46.996
and there's been
some-some blowback.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.039
Blowback?

04:51.166 --> 04:53.043
All right, fine, fine, fine.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.587
So, what, I-I'm down a-a point?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.006
Point and a half? Two?

04:57.047 --> 04:59.008
(clears throat)
No, nine and a half.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.218
Nine and a half?

05:01.301 --> 05:04.763
Nine... nine and a half?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.682
(stammers)

05:06.724 --> 05:08.100
(angry shouting on video)

05:10.811 --> 05:12.938
CROWD (chanting):
Homelander kills!

05:12.980 --> 05:15.899
What, th-they're
fucking protesting...

05:15.941 --> 05:17.484
-Homelander kills!
-...me?

05:17.526 --> 05:18.610
Oh, my God, th-they're pro...

05:18.652 --> 05:19.903
they're protesting me?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.447
They've been at the Tower
all afternoon.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.741
Why didn't you fucking
say something?

05:23.782 --> 05:26.076
Goddamn it.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.828
Don't these fucking
ingrates realize

05:27.870 --> 05:29.705
I killed that asshole for them.

05:29.747 --> 05:31.415
What do they think "Saving
America" fucking means, anyway?

05:31.457 --> 05:34.543
Well, PR is drafting
a response as we speak.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.086
Acknowledgment, apology, action.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.880
No, no, no, no. Apology?

05:37.921 --> 05:39.256
No.

05:39.298 --> 05:40.799
You schedule
a press conference,

05:40.841 --> 05:42.676
and-and I'll clean it up myself.

05:42.718 --> 05:45.971
Uh, well, Mr. Edgar...

05:46.013 --> 05:49.349
and Legal would like
your official position

05:49.391 --> 05:52.019
to be "no comment" at this time.

05:52.061 --> 05:54.521
(shuddered breaths)
Please, no press

05:54.563 --> 05:57.191
until the crisis team
has an actionable strategy.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.234
Okay?

06:00.944 --> 06:02.613
STORMFRONT:
Bad day?

06:04.656 --> 06:06.867
Hey, I'm with you.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.036
Fuck these maxi pad-wearing
ingrate hicks,

06:09.078 --> 06:10.704
but, you know,
there's a way to handle it.

06:10.746 --> 06:13.248
I do not need your fucking help.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.502
Sure. You seem to be doing
so well on your own.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.047
Well, I'm here when you want me.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.511
(punk rock playing)

06:27.679 --> 06:30.682
(music continues)

07:02.464 --> 07:04.508
(music plays distantly,
distorted)

07:10.430 --> 07:13.016
(music resumes playing loudly)

07:49.595 --> 07:51.680
(music playing quietly
over speakers)

07:53.223 --> 07:54.433
(sighs)

08:05.652 --> 08:07.196
(phone ringing)

08:11.241 --> 08:13.869
(drops basket on floor)

08:19.666 --> 08:22.544
-(phone beeps)
-(drops bag into basket)

08:22.586 --> 08:25.088
Hello, hello. Hughie?

08:25.130 --> 08:26.715
HUGHIE:
Hey, hey. Hi, hi.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.176
Sorry, thought, uh,
I was getting your voice mail.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.345
That why you called five times?

08:31.386 --> 08:33.013
No, I just thought
you should know

08:33.055 --> 08:35.974
Liberty, that Supe that Raynor
was looking into,

08:36.016 --> 08:37.726
turns out it's Stormfront.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.561
Vought changed her name,
they've been moving her around

08:39.603 --> 08:41.438
like a fucking Catholic priest.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.232
-Right.
-Um...

08:43.273 --> 08:44.775
she probably murdered Raynor.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.027
Annie's trying
to figure out why, but...

08:47.069 --> 08:48.528
you know, who the fuck knows.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.030
Well...

08:50.072 --> 08:51.740
as long as Starlight's
on the job,

08:51.782 --> 08:53.075
we're sorted then, yeah?

08:54.117 --> 08:57.496
I'm not...
I'm not mad, you know.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.289
What you mean?

08:59.331 --> 09:02.209
I-I just want you
to know that, um...

09:02.251 --> 09:05.128
yes, you are leaving us holding
the bag on this shitshow,

09:05.170 --> 09:06.380
but I want you to know
that I-I get it.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.382
It's, uh, Becca.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.092
I'd do the same thing.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.385
I'm not mad.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.222
Well...

09:15.264 --> 09:16.640
wouldn't matter if you were.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.642
Uh, how is she?

09:18.684 --> 09:20.644
Lovelier than the day
I met her.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.562
(toy squeaking)

09:22.604 --> 09:24.982
-(squeaking)
-Where are you?

09:25.023 --> 09:26.525
Heading off grid.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.818
Argentina, maybe.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.278
Early retirement.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.613
Butcher?

09:31.655 --> 09:33.699
Yeah, what?

09:35.742 --> 09:37.744
You could've said goodbye.

09:39.705 --> 09:43.292
I know we've been
through some shit together.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.715
You were...

09:49.756 --> 09:53.218
you were always like my canary,
I suppose.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.721
Thank you.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.140
-Goodbye, Hughie.
-Your canary...

09:58.181 --> 10:00.475
Hello?

10:04.354 --> 10:07.024
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

10:09.526 --> 10:10.736
(phone clangs in can)

10:10.777 --> 10:12.738
CLAIRE:
On your feet, soldier.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.411
Take me home to Lallybroch.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.662
HUGHIE:
What are you watching?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.958
A show called Eat My Dick.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.169
Okay.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.338
Have you seen Frenchie
or Kimiko?

10:29.379 --> 10:32.007
No. No, not...
for a while. Why?

10:32.049 --> 10:33.884
(quietly):
Fuck.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.802
Uh, listen, I just got
off the phone with Butcher

10:35.844 --> 10:37.346
and I think something
might be wrong.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.973
Like really, really wrong.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.059
What would make you think that?

10:42.100 --> 10:46.646
He was nice and...

10:48.398 --> 10:50.692
...called me his canary?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.783
Tell me everything he said.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.422
(distant explosion)

11:12.464 --> 11:13.840
Agent Pearson, sir.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.717
(coughs)

11:19.012 --> 11:21.098
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.808
Agent Cruz,
I thought we'd lost you.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.810
I got by with a little help
from a friend.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.186
PEARSON:
Huh, so?

11:26.228 --> 11:28.021
Good news or bad?

11:30.232 --> 11:32.984
Yeah, I'd say that's good news.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.277
BOURKE:
And now the CG mutants approach.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.363
PEARSON:
And there's the bad news.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.407
There's no way
we can restore the grid

11:38.448 --> 11:40.575
if we don't get that flash drive
to the Tower.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.327
But how are you gonna get
through all of them?

11:42.369 --> 11:43.703
STARLIGHT:
Don't worry.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.125
Girls get it done.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.835
And cut on rehearsal.
No one move.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.336
-No one move. No one move.
-MAN: Cut on rehearsal!

11:51.378 --> 11:52.838
-Starlight. I'm not touching.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.172
-But can you just take a step?
-Mm-hmm.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.298
Yeah, so keep going closer.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.591
Can you mark her
closer to Stormfront?

11:56.633 --> 11:57.926
Let's mark her, please.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.177
And let's just pretend...

11:59.219 --> 12:00.178
like you like her, okay?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.805
(both laughing)

12:01.847 --> 12:03.473
(laughing):
Okay, if I have to.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.933
Okay. Okay, good stuff.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.476
Let's try one for that.
All right, good.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.270
We should've shot that.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.855
I mean, clearly you like me.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.899
You've been eye-fucking me like
a lovesick stangirl all day.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.943
Why is that?

12:14.985 --> 12:17.446
I don't know. I think
that you're a good actor.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.657
And I just, I feel like
a friggin' fembot up there.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.618
(chuckles)
You know...

12:23.660 --> 12:26.455
BOURKE:
Everybody, can we please
stand by to roll.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.873
Let's try to make our day.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.083
-How about that? Okay.
-Thank you.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.460
♪ Extra, Extra. ♪

12:31.501 --> 12:34.212
And turning now
to superhero news,

12:34.254 --> 12:37.174
former Seven member the Deep
surprised everybody last week

12:37.215 --> 12:39.926
when he married
Cassandra Schwartz,

12:39.968 --> 12:41.344
an anthropology professor
at Vassar,

12:41.386 --> 12:43.096
in an intimate ceremony.

12:43.138 --> 12:46.183
-Now, the couple has asked...
-Banana saltwater taffy.

12:46.224 --> 12:47.267
God bless.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.852
Ron can't live without it.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.770
-(chuckles)
-(doorbell rings)

12:53.857 --> 12:55.317
Billy?

12:55.358 --> 12:57.527
-Hello, Judy.
-WOMAN: Who's this?

12:57.569 --> 12:59.154
He's my nephew.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.697
(teakettle whistling)

13:01.740 --> 13:04.075
(whistling slows, stops)

13:04.117 --> 13:06.411
For Christ's sake, Billy,
you got to ring your mum.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.497
Where's my boy?

13:08.538 --> 13:10.790
Your mum and dad
are flying over, you know.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.752
Your mum's worried to death
about you.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.253
No.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.713
You tell 'em no.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.382
It'd be a waste of a perfectly
good plane ticket.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.551
JUDY (sighs):
Your father's quite ill.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.637
The cancer's spreading fast.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.347
Yeah, well, not fast enough.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.517
I ain't seeing 'em.
Now, where's me boy?

13:31.311 --> 13:34.272
(dog panting)

13:34.314 --> 13:35.565
Oi, Terror.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.402
You little rascal, eh?

13:39.444 --> 13:40.654
Look at you, you little fucker.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.489
You haven't changed a day.

13:42.531 --> 13:45.575
How's about you and me go
for a little stroll then, eh?

13:45.617 --> 13:47.577
Yeah?

13:47.619 --> 13:49.621
Come on.

14:06.388 --> 14:09.099
So this is what it all
comes to, eh?

14:09.140 --> 14:14.312
Metamucil and ringing our dicks
out for a few drops of piss.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.939
(scoffs)

14:18.149 --> 14:21.111
I used to think that you, me and
Becca would grow old together.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.405
Bloody stupid.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.532
Turns out she don't...

14:27.784 --> 14:29.786
(scoffs)

14:31.413 --> 14:34.624
(sighs)
What the fuck was any of it for?

14:42.007 --> 14:43.550
BOURKE:
Yes.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.176
There he is, there's my guy.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.220
Looking spectacular, as always.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.471
-How we doing?
-Good.

14:48.513 --> 14:49.931
-Feel good?
-Yeah. Uh...

14:49.973 --> 14:51.224
Are you ready, huh?
You ready for this...

14:51.266 --> 14:52.517
this big fucking scene today?

14:52.559 --> 14:53.935
Yeah, well,
that's-that's basically

14:53.977 --> 14:55.395
what I wanted
to talk to you about.

14:55.437 --> 14:56.980
-Great. Yeah.
-'Cause I did a little bit
of a rewrite

14:57.022 --> 14:59.190
and I want you to take a look.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.401
-(A-Train clears throat)
-Wow.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.236
-(laughs nervously)
-(A-Train clicks tongue)

15:03.278 --> 15:05.739
What a... lot of work.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.115
Yeah, I...

15:07.157 --> 15:10.493
I just felt like the dialogue
was a little... off.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.245
You know, A-Train...

15:12.287 --> 15:14.623
-would never say
any of this shit.
-Right.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.082
And you definitely
just don't need that

15:16.124 --> 15:19.419
giant expo dump at the end.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.839
Your... big farewell speech?

15:22.881 --> 15:24.466
(both chuckle)

15:24.507 --> 15:28.178
Honestly, I think it's better
if we just leave it open-ended.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.471
-Okay.
-You know what I mean?

15:29.512 --> 15:31.556
Uh, where we can just play
it in looks

15:31.598 --> 15:33.433
and just not a whole bunch
of words.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.393
-Right.
-Maybe make it
more of a question.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.395
Like, is A-Train really
leaving The Seven?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.105
-Yeah.
-We don't know.

15:39.147 --> 15:42.025
-We don't know.
-We don't know.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.568
Yeah.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.153
Yeah, I think
we're just gonna go ahead

15:45.195 --> 15:46.905
and do the scene as scripted.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.365
But thank you for putting
all this thought into it,

15:48.406 --> 15:49.741
right, it shows
you got a lot of heart.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.826
Take that heart,
put it in the scene.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.745
All right, good stuff.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.830
I'm not doing it.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.582
(mouthing)

15:57.624 --> 15:59.417
I'm not doing this shitty scene.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.712
Well... (chuckles)

16:04.214 --> 16:07.175
That is way above my pay grade.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.137
Bring that up with Ashley.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.723
Right? Right.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.308
Ooh, by the way.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.935
I got the crew
a Vietnamese crepe truck.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.561
They make a gluten-free
banh xeo.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.106
It is... (inhales)
fantastic.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.524
You're going to be great, baby.

16:22.565 --> 16:23.525
-Where are we going?
-WOMAN: Oh,

16:23.566 --> 16:24.943
we need to see you in Wardrobe.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.737
KATIE COURIC:
Deep.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.699
You look so happy.
I hardly recognize you.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.825
Katie, I'm in love, you know,

16:31.866 --> 16:33.493
to an extraordinary woman

16:33.535 --> 16:35.495
I'm now blessed to call my wife.

16:35.537 --> 16:38.164
-(Cassandra chuckles)
-Ah, that-that's really nice.

16:38.206 --> 16:41.376
Well, let's address
the elephant in the room.

16:41.418 --> 16:42.544
Shall we?

16:42.585 --> 16:44.629
Well, you know,
I'm-I'm glad you asked,

16:44.671 --> 16:46.339
because, uh, yeah, you know,

16:46.381 --> 16:50.093
Kevin here has had some
issues in the past.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.636
But people grow.

16:51.678 --> 16:55.140
And if you could see the letters
that he writes me.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.350
I mean, you would know
what a beautiful soul he has.

16:57.392 --> 16:58.393
Oh, thank you.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.602
Well, she's only saying that

16:59.644 --> 17:01.146
'cause I make her
breakfast in bed, so...

17:01.187 --> 17:02.439
-(laughs) Oh, stop.
-French toast.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.482
(both laughing)

17:06.109 --> 17:09.988
So, you are both members of
the Church of the Collective.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.323
-Mm-hmm.
-It's not realistic.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.034
Alexander Hamilton wasn't
no Puerto Rican.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.911
That's the point.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.873
It's a metaphor for the
immigrant experience in America.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.708
But he was a white guy.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.543
Ah.

17:23.585 --> 17:26.546
You know what's really good?

17:26.588 --> 17:28.256
Dear Evan Hansen.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.799
Can we help you?

17:34.262 --> 17:36.723
(music playing)

17:36.765 --> 17:38.433
She's just a girl.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.643
Show her a picture of kittens
or some shit.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.062
(man laughing)

17:43.104 --> 17:45.064
How 'bout I show her
my motherfuckin' dick?

17:45.106 --> 17:46.399
(indistinct chatter)

17:52.614 --> 17:53.698
Bitch ain't right in the head.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.450
(Russian pop song playing)

17:55.492 --> 17:56.493
Fuck!

17:59.162 --> 18:00.288
Holy shit!

18:03.333 --> 18:05.585
(grunting)

18:05.627 --> 18:07.754
(bones snap)

18:07.796 --> 18:10.089
(man speaks Russian)

18:17.639 --> 18:20.892
(song continues)

18:21.893 --> 18:23.853
Merde.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.044
JUDY:
Oi, Billy.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.463
You should've told me
you were bringing company.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.091
Oi, who's this one
remind you of?

18:53.132 --> 18:56.261
Isn't he the spitting of Lenny?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.890
No.

19:00.932 --> 19:03.017
Thought you were retiring.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.770
Argentina, right?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.772
I am.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.776
What are you doing here?

19:11.818 --> 19:13.778
Well, Hughie heard a dog toy
on the phone.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.490
And I know you keep Terror
at your aunt's, so...

19:17.532 --> 19:18.825
Brilliant as ever.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.118
Time to go.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.911
Come help us with Stormfront.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.872
Came all this way for that,
did you?

19:23.913 --> 19:26.457
No, we...
we came 'cause we're worried.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.585
Your cunt sense tingling, is it?

19:28.626 --> 19:32.005
Well, don't you worry--
I'm sorted.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.756
Where's Becca, man?

19:33.798 --> 19:35.216
Becca?

19:35.258 --> 19:37.886
What's he talking about?

19:37.927 --> 19:40.013
Waiting for me
at the Hampton Inn.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.598
-So...
-(claps hands)

19:41.639 --> 19:44.309
lots of thanks,
time to piss off.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.477
We're not going anywhere.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.399
Right.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.152
JUDY (clears throat, chuckles):
Just so you know,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.529
that's Terror's girlfriend.

19:56.571 --> 20:00.241
-What?
-His fuck pig.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.707
(engine starting)

20:10.084 --> 20:11.920
(engine idling)

20:25.975 --> 20:27.977
(lock clicks)

20:28.019 --> 20:29.395
Black Noir's here.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.065
What?

20:33.358 --> 20:35.902
MOTHER'S MILK:
It wasn't us-- we were cautious.

20:35.944 --> 20:38.071
We swapped cars, no toll roads.

20:38.112 --> 20:40.073
It's not you. It's me.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.951
He must've tracked me
from Becca's.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.328
JUDY:
Billy, what's this all about?

20:45.370 --> 20:48.039
It's complicated.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.624
Becca's not with me.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.543
You... couldn't get her out?

20:56.297 --> 20:58.007
She didn't want out.

21:00.802 --> 21:02.845
I'll explain everything,

21:02.887 --> 21:05.640
but right now we're
in a little bit of trouble.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.558
I'm sorry, Judy.
I shouldn't have come.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.852
Okay, maybe...

21:09.894 --> 21:11.938
maybe we can make a run for it.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.189
Just get to the car.

21:13.231 --> 21:16.567
No, he moves faster than a car.

21:17.819 --> 21:21.280
But if he wants to kill us...

21:21.322 --> 21:23.992
he'll have to do it
with an audience.

21:25.910 --> 21:29.497
(siren wailing,
truck horn honking)

21:29.539 --> 21:31.541
MAN (over speaker):
This is the fire department.

21:31.582 --> 21:33.459
A natural gas leak
has been reported.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.837
Everyone out of your homes.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.172
I repeat, a gas leak
has been reported...

21:38.214 --> 21:40.883
Nice one, M.M.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.094
Let's hope they stay a while.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.388
Ma'am, do you have
any nails, ball bearings,

21:45.430 --> 21:47.932
electrical wiring,
pressurized aerosol products.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.892
I need a can about this big.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.436
Really appreciate it.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.315
STORMFRONT:
Team Britney, 2007.

21:56.357 --> 21:57.900
-(laughter)
-Remember the meltdown?

21:57.942 --> 22:00.653
Oh, ooh, yeah, that...

22:00.695 --> 22:02.572
But, you know...

22:02.613 --> 22:04.407
You're a firecracker.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.451
-Mom?
-STORMFRONT: Oh, hi.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.453
Annie.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.913
Oh, you-you-you look so pretty.

22:12.206 --> 22:13.624
What...?

22:13.666 --> 22:15.168
-What are you doing here?
-I-I'm in town.

22:15.209 --> 22:16.961
I've been texting you for days.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.672
I-I-I wasn't trying
to ambush you, I promise.

22:19.714 --> 22:22.175
Did you get any of
the Vietnamese crepes?

22:22.216 --> 22:23.593
'Cause they're dope.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.763
No, no, no, I'm good. Thanks.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.351
Your mom was telling me

22:32.393 --> 22:33.853
about the hero pageants
you used to do.

22:33.895 --> 22:35.271
(feigns laughter)

22:35.313 --> 22:36.606
Lucky.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.733
My mom would never let me.

22:38.775 --> 22:41.110
Adele did not go in
for that sort of thing.

22:41.152 --> 22:44.572
I had to do all my speeches
to a brush in the mirror.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.574
I like this one.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.576
Mom, this isn't a great time.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.952
I-I know that you're busy,

22:49.994 --> 22:52.955
but you don't have
to entertain me, I promise.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.707
I-I wanted to see you,
sweetheart.

22:54.749 --> 22:57.126
I... I miss you.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.962
(slurping)

23:00.004 --> 23:01.672
(chuckles weakly)

23:03.716 --> 23:05.259
I think that this is something

23:05.301 --> 23:09.013
that we need to discuss
in private.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.099
Donna, can I tell her?

23:11.140 --> 23:13.184
-Tell me what?
-Look, your mom

23:13.226 --> 23:15.853
is so sorry
about the Compound V,

23:15.895 --> 23:18.272
and she understands
that keeping that a secret

23:18.314 --> 23:20.399
really hurt your relationship.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.151
Yeah, and that I-I used you
as a trophy

23:22.193 --> 23:23.945
to make myself feel important.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.321
I know that now.

23:25.363 --> 23:28.157
Why are you talking to a
stranger about our relationship?

23:28.199 --> 23:29.408
She's not a stranger.

23:29.450 --> 23:30.701
She's your teammate.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.206
(clears throat)

23:35.248 --> 23:38.209
Annie, the-the whole world
knows about Compound V.

23:38.251 --> 23:42.588
I mean,
lots of parents did what I did.

23:42.630 --> 23:46.300
I... I'm hoping that you'll...

23:46.342 --> 23:48.386
that you'll forgive me.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.679
Please forgive me, Annie.

23:49.720 --> 23:54.267
This is not the time
or the place for this.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.270
Look, everyone is upset
about Compound V.

23:57.311 --> 24:00.898
I mean, someone was so upset,
they leaked it to the press.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.025
Can you imagine how angry
that person is?

24:03.067 --> 24:05.069
Whoever they are?

24:07.697 --> 24:11.450
I'll let you two hash it out,
but I just think...

24:11.492 --> 24:15.830
if it was me, I'd be grateful
to have a mom like Donna.

24:23.546 --> 24:26.382
Honey, please?

24:27.508 --> 24:29.719
I need to get back to set.

24:30.970 --> 24:34.849
Do you need someone
to drive you back to your hotel?

24:34.891 --> 24:37.059
No, I'll-I'll-I'll get a cab.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.187
(quietly):
Okay.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.771
SETH:
Okay,

24:40.813 --> 24:42.857
now, Queen Maeve, a goddess,

24:42.899 --> 24:45.484
but our Empress of the
Otherworld struggles inside.

24:45.526 --> 24:48.237
Questions of identity
rock her to her core.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.406
-Until she meets...
-Elena.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.074
The connection is immediate,
all-consuming.

24:52.116 --> 24:54.702
A sweet sapphic love blossoms,

24:54.744 --> 24:56.078
raising Maeve's consciousness

24:56.120 --> 24:58.080
and revealing
her own inner truth.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.458
She's gay, and it's okay.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.792
-It's...
-Powerful.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.878
She's more than just
a superhero now.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.880
She is a symbol.

25:05.922 --> 25:07.173
Representation matters.

25:07.215 --> 25:10.760
She's #BraveMaeve.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.471
We're recommending
a multipronged image makeover.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.640
First, guest spots on Queer Eye.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.849
Then, an exclusive
"It Gets Better" PSA.

25:16.891 --> 25:18.184
Kimberly Peirce might direct.

25:18.226 --> 25:20.144
Grand marshals at the New York
and Chicago Pride,

25:20.186 --> 25:21.938
because you are two
proud lesbians.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.064
(snaps fingers)

25:23.105 --> 25:24.273
You know Maeve is bi, right?

25:24.315 --> 25:25.608
ASHLEY:
Yeah, you know what?

25:25.650 --> 25:27.068
I just feel like lesbian
is a bit of an easier sell.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.653
A bit more cut-and-dry.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.071
-Now, for Elena...
-Me?

25:30.112 --> 25:31.364
You're going to love it, yeah.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.740
Why am I a part of this shit?

25:32.782 --> 25:35.868
We are going with
a polished, tailored look.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.620
(Elena sighs)

25:37.662 --> 25:39.664
-That looks like menswear.
-Pew research shows

25:39.705 --> 25:41.040
that two feminine women
in a relationship

25:41.082 --> 25:42.875
sends a problematic message.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.585
Yeah, this isn't
Penthouse Forum.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.462
SETH:
Americans are
more accepting of gays

25:46.504 --> 25:49.215
when they're in a clear-cut
gender role relationship.

25:49.257 --> 25:51.384
-Like Ellen and Portia.
-ELENA: Okay.

25:51.425 --> 25:52.843
Let's get one thing straight.

25:52.885 --> 25:56.931
I have no interest in being
in a public relationship.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.182
Oh, you will be compensated.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.434
I am not for sale.

26:02.311 --> 26:03.604
Really?

26:03.646 --> 26:06.023
You're not going
to say anything?

26:15.825 --> 26:17.159
(smacks lips)

26:17.201 --> 26:19.495
-I'll fix this.
-Yeah.

26:20.538 --> 26:21.956
Elena.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.541
Elena, wait.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.502
If they want a lesbian Ken doll,

26:26.544 --> 26:28.212
they can find someone else.

26:30.464 --> 26:31.966
I am going to cash in
my vacation days

26:32.008 --> 26:33.050
and go stay with my sister.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.052
No. You can't do that.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.888
Why? I'm not under contract.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.890
This is Homelander.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.184
Okay? And he's fucking with me.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.853
And if you go out there,

26:43.894 --> 26:48.274
Elena, there is nowhere you can
go that he won't find you.

26:48.316 --> 26:49.650
Please.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.444
Stay.

26:51.485 --> 26:54.488
I can't protect you
if you leave.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.617
But what are we gonna do?

26:58.659 --> 27:00.161
(Elena sighs)

27:00.202 --> 27:03.331
We're gonna take
that motherfucker down.

27:04.707 --> 27:07.126
-You trust me?
-Yeah.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.423
(indistinct radio chatter)

27:15.551 --> 27:17.845
Okay.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.430
Is this right?

27:19.472 --> 27:23.976
Just like Home Alone
except way less delightful.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.647
Butcher?

27:28.689 --> 27:31.567
No.

27:31.609 --> 27:34.570
It ain't right.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.199
What's going on?

27:38.240 --> 27:40.618
That ninja cunt's here
for me, isn't he?

27:40.659 --> 27:43.746
Yeah, but you can't go
out there-- he'll kill you.

27:46.165 --> 27:49.627
(scoffs)
So...

27:49.668 --> 27:51.337
So that's it?

27:51.379 --> 27:54.715
Expecting a happy ending,
were we?

27:54.757 --> 27:56.926
Well, I'm sorry, Hughie.

27:56.967 --> 27:59.929
It ain't that kind
of massage parlor.

27:59.970 --> 28:03.182
Now, I can keep him busy
for a little while, yeah?

28:03.224 --> 28:05.935
Give you lot a chance to leg it.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.230
I'm knackered.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.734
I could use a little lie-down.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.614
Fuck you.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.032
What, am I supposed
to be impressed

28:20.074 --> 28:22.284
by this blaze of glory
jerk-off shit?

28:22.326 --> 28:23.744
Guess not.

28:23.786 --> 28:27.081
You don't think I thought
about cashing it in after Robin?

28:27.123 --> 28:29.125
'Cause I do.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.045
Still.

28:33.087 --> 28:35.089
A lot.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.178
But I don't.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.682
(scoffs)

28:44.723 --> 28:49.186
And the thing that kills me
is that your wife is alive.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.730
She just doesn't want you,
that's all.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.109
Say that again.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.569
So you don't have shit.

28:56.610 --> 28:59.196
Welcome to the fucking club.

28:59.238 --> 29:03.242
I mean, come on, what do, what
do any of us have? Besides...

29:07.079 --> 29:09.748
Who the fuck asked you
to come here?

29:09.790 --> 29:11.876
Eh?

29:11.917 --> 29:15.045
I don't need your help.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.590
Jesus, you're fucking pathetic.

29:17.631 --> 29:20.926
You're so scared
of being alone, Hughie.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.595
First you latch onto Robin,

29:22.636 --> 29:24.305
then Starlight, and now me.

29:24.346 --> 29:25.806
Well, you know what, son?

29:25.848 --> 29:28.476
I ain't interested.

29:35.232 --> 29:38.319
Look, just get out
of the fucking way.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.826
Don't make me move you.

29:45.868 --> 29:49.371
You can move him,

29:49.413 --> 29:51.874
but good luck with me.

30:00.508 --> 30:02.510
(car horns honking in distance)

30:24.865 --> 30:27.618
Que se passe-t-il?

30:33.499 --> 30:35.084
She wanted the job.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.086
You have her doing hits?

30:37.127 --> 30:39.922
The Albanians
have her doing hits.

30:39.964 --> 30:42.466
I'm just a girl
getting ten percent.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.802
-You...
-(quietly): I'm sorry, pumpkin,

30:44.843 --> 30:47.721
but I told you,

30:47.763 --> 30:50.516
she's no kitten.

30:50.558 --> 30:53.185
She can make her own choices.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.565
Why?

31:00.234 --> 31:03.028
How is this stopping Stormfront?

31:04.196 --> 31:06.407
I know you blame yourself
for your brother,

31:06.448 --> 31:08.659
I know the rage you feel,

31:08.701 --> 31:12.788
but this... this is not the way.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.623
This is poison for your soul.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.083
I know.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.799
Come with me, mon coeur.

31:26.135 --> 31:30.264
I got my own baby brother
killed!

31:31.557 --> 31:35.060
He was the only thing
that mattered to me!

31:37.271 --> 31:38.314
Stop trying to help me!

31:38.355 --> 31:40.691
I don't want your help!

31:40.733 --> 31:42.610
I don't understand
what you're saying

31:42.651 --> 31:44.695
because you won't teach me!

31:50.576 --> 31:53.287
Fuck this.

31:53.329 --> 31:54.913
Fuck you.

31:58.042 --> 32:00.586
Go be a monster.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.723
DEEP:
Remember when you were young

32:12.765 --> 32:15.309
and the world was full
of possibilities?

32:15.351 --> 32:16.852
Before all the mistakes,

32:16.894 --> 32:19.647
heartbreaks
and disappointments?

32:19.688 --> 32:23.067
What if you could go back
to the way things were?

32:23.108 --> 32:27.488
I used to be angry,
insecure and unsure.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.448
But thanks to the Church
of the Collective,

32:29.490 --> 32:32.409
I now know the kind of man
I want to be.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.495
The kind of man
who calls out injustice

32:34.536 --> 32:36.288
-when he sees it.
-WOMAN: Stop.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.457
-MAN: Come on.
-Hey, dude.

32:38.499 --> 32:40.959
That's not cool.

32:41.001 --> 32:44.296
The kind of man who stands up
for what's right.

32:44.338 --> 32:47.633
Come on, guys, knock it off.

32:47.675 --> 32:50.636
The kind of man who sees
the potential in all of us.

32:50.678 --> 32:53.305
So join us at the
Church of the Collective,

32:53.347 --> 32:56.725
and be the person
you were always meant to be.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.234
(scoffs)

33:05.275 --> 33:07.361
That's a bunch of bullshit.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.570
STORMFRONT:
Didn't used to be.

33:08.612 --> 33:10.364
Church used to mean something.

33:10.406 --> 33:12.157
Oh, what, are you a member?

33:12.199 --> 33:14.660
I was, long time ago.

33:14.702 --> 33:15.786
Hmm.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.913
That place used to be pure.

33:17.955 --> 33:21.834
And then they just started
letting all kinds of people in,

33:21.875 --> 33:24.378
you know?

33:24.420 --> 33:27.047
I don't know.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.259
So, why don't you tell me?

33:30.300 --> 33:32.428
Well, I think you do know.

33:32.469 --> 33:36.306
Some people are quality
and others are...

33:36.348 --> 33:38.350
garbage.

33:38.392 --> 33:40.144
-(bell rings)
-MAN: We are rolling.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.146
Oh, by the way,

33:42.187 --> 33:44.732
I heard they're retiring you?

33:46.024 --> 33:48.610
So unfair.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.574
Do you have a problem?

33:53.615 --> 33:55.659
Of course not.
Why would you say that?

33:57.202 --> 33:58.662
(slurping)

33:58.704 --> 34:02.040
Can I have a word? Please?

34:03.917 --> 34:06.712
Adam tells me you don't
want to do the scene.

34:06.754 --> 34:08.881
I just can't be a part
of something I don't believe in.

34:08.922 --> 34:11.550
Look, I know it's not easy
losing your job. Okay?

34:11.592 --> 34:14.011
When I got fired, I tindered
my way through Barcelona.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.388
Everyone in that city
ate my paella.

34:16.430 --> 34:17.890
Fucked a guy with elephantiasis.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.893
But I got through it,
and so will you.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.352
Yeah, but I'm still
making it happen.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.229
I mean, my A-Trainers sell
how many fucking pairs per year?

34:24.271 --> 34:25.564
Look on the bright side--

34:25.606 --> 34:27.399
you served four years longer
than Mr. Marathon.

34:27.441 --> 34:29.318
Now, that is something, okay.

34:29.359 --> 34:33.197
But... please.

34:33.238 --> 34:36.074
Let me just...
talk to Homelander.

34:36.116 --> 34:38.702
We both know
that's not a good idea.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.496
I'm sorry.

34:41.538 --> 34:43.290
I'm not saying the lines.

34:43.332 --> 34:45.793
Okay, this can go
one of two ways.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.753
One: You leave The Seven
with your dignity

34:47.795 --> 34:49.296
and your severance package
intact.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.590
Or two: You get fired

34:51.632 --> 34:52.925
for breaching
your morality clause

34:52.966 --> 34:54.551
by shooting up Compound V

34:54.593 --> 34:56.136
and giving yourself
a fucking heart attack

34:56.178 --> 34:58.096
in the fucking process.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.349
It's your choice.

35:11.485 --> 35:13.403
A-TRAIN:
You know, the truth is...

35:13.445 --> 35:16.073
I've been running my whole life.

35:16.114 --> 35:20.410
Think it's time
that I stay put for a while.

35:20.452 --> 35:23.372
It's time I went home.

35:23.413 --> 35:26.917
I know this is
dawn of The Seven.

35:28.335 --> 35:31.505
But it's sunset on A-Train.

35:33.215 --> 35:34.591
It's been a good run.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.884
BOURKE:
Cut!

35:35.926 --> 35:38.178
(bell rings)

35:38.220 --> 35:40.389
Hey, dude. That was awesome.

35:40.430 --> 35:44.226
Awesome?
A-Dog, that was fucking gold.

35:44.268 --> 35:47.396
Buddy, look, I'm ready
to move on, but how do you feel?

35:47.437 --> 35:48.856
You want another one?
Just let me know.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.817
No, man, go ahead and move on.

35:51.859 --> 35:53.026
All right, check it! Moving on!

35:53.068 --> 35:54.736
Tiffany, we need you
over at Mo-cap.

35:54.778 --> 35:55.946
-MAN: Good day.
-TIFFANY: Yeah,
going over there now.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.447
(overlapping chatter)

35:57.489 --> 35:58.782
NEUMAN (over speaker):
Yes, it's true.

35:58.824 --> 36:02.411
Vought has all the money
and the power.

36:02.452 --> 36:05.289
And we have,
no offense, jack shit.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.456
-(laughter)
-MAN: We love you, Victoria!

36:06.498 --> 36:09.543
But after Homelander's
war crime...

36:09.585 --> 36:10.961
(crowd clamoring)

36:11.003 --> 36:12.754
...how can I stay quiet

36:12.796 --> 36:14.965
and still look my daughter
in the eyes?

36:15.007 --> 36:16.884
I can't. I know you can't.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.093
And guess what.

36:18.135 --> 36:21.179
The House Judiciary
can't either!

36:21.221 --> 36:22.723
Finally!

36:22.764 --> 36:24.474
We are going to hold hearings

36:24.516 --> 36:27.519
-on Vought and Compound V!
-(applause and cheering)

36:27.561 --> 36:29.563
Yes! Yes!

36:29.605 --> 36:32.232
(crowd gasps)

36:32.274 --> 36:33.734
(crowd quiets)

36:33.775 --> 36:35.694
Hey, everyone.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.992
May I?

36:43.577 --> 36:45.829
Thank you.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.582
Congresswoman Neuman, everybody.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.709
Isn't she great?
Didn't you love that little

36:50.751 --> 36:53.837
"Walk Like an Egyptian" dance
she did online?

36:53.879 --> 36:55.464
So fun.

36:55.505 --> 36:57.007
I loved it.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.301
But fun is not what
we're here for, is it?

36:59.343 --> 37:01.011
-No, no, no, no, no, fuck.
-Let me just start by saying

37:01.053 --> 37:03.221
how pleased I am
to see you all here.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.307
Everyone get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

37:05.349 --> 37:07.225
-Fuck you. Get out.
-...that we live in a country

37:07.267 --> 37:09.645
where all your voices
can be heard.

37:09.686 --> 37:11.897
I know that some of you
are a little upset

37:11.939 --> 37:15.442
by that video online
of me stopping the terrorist,

37:15.484 --> 37:19.905
and I just want you to know
that I understand.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.282
I'm upset, too.

37:22.324 --> 37:24.409
I mean, come on, guys.

37:24.451 --> 37:26.286
Nobody wants innocent people
to get hurt.

37:26.328 --> 37:28.705
Of course not.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.834
But sadly,

37:32.876 --> 37:35.796
well, the bad guys,

37:35.837 --> 37:38.382
they don't think like us.

37:39.758 --> 37:44.012
And so, sometimes...

37:44.054 --> 37:45.305
well, these things just happen.

37:45.347 --> 37:46.598
(crowd murmuring)

37:46.640 --> 37:48.433
MAN:
Wait, this happened before?

37:48.475 --> 37:50.978
-MAN 2: How many times?
-Well, no, h-hold on, guys.

37:51.019 --> 37:55.857
My point is, we all have
the same goals, don't we?

37:55.899 --> 37:58.443
-To keep our country safe.
-(shuddering): No.

37:58.485 --> 38:01.238
WOMAN:
So American lives are
the only ones worth protecting?

38:01.279 --> 38:02.823
Of course not.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.826
But if you've served with our
amazing soldiers, like I have,

38:05.867 --> 38:09.830
you would know that freedom
comes at a price.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.999
You don't speak for us!

38:12.040 --> 38:14.751
-MAN:
Yeah, you don't speak for us!
-(angry clamoring)

38:14.793 --> 38:16.169
You don't speak for us!

38:16.211 --> 38:17.713
-You don't speak for us!
-You don't speak for us!

38:17.754 --> 38:20.298
All right, all right.
Everyone just calm down.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.009
Calm down.
Let's not let your hearts

38:22.050 --> 38:23.885
-get in the way of your heads.
-You don't speak for us!

38:23.927 --> 38:25.345
(chanting):
You don't speak for us!

38:25.387 --> 38:27.014
-Everyone just relax.
-You don't speak for us!

38:27.055 --> 38:28.098
You don't speak for us!

38:28.140 --> 38:30.559
-Calm down.
-You don't speak for us!

38:30.600 --> 38:33.979
You don't speak for us!
You don't speak for us!

38:34.021 --> 38:35.522
-You don't speak for us!
-MAN: Fuck Homelander!

38:35.564 --> 38:37.357
CROWD:
You don't speak for us!

38:37.399 --> 38:39.276
(panicked screaming)

38:57.127 --> 39:00.005
You don't speak for us!
You don't speak for us!

39:00.047 --> 39:01.256
You don't speak
for us!

39:01.298 --> 39:02.466
All right.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.968
You guys are the real heroes.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.636
God bless you!

39:06.678 --> 39:08.430
Love you guys!

39:08.472 --> 39:11.725
You don't speak for us!
You don't speak for us!

39:11.767 --> 39:12.726
(crowd cheering)

39:12.768 --> 39:14.853
(shuddering)

39:14.895 --> 39:16.897
(cheering continues)

39:22.819 --> 39:25.155
-You guys are all good.
-WOMAN: Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.199
(indistinct chatter)

39:29.618 --> 39:31.495
(truck horn honking)

39:31.536 --> 39:33.538
(siren wailing)

39:41.797 --> 39:43.673
-It's time.
-Right, lads.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.717
To the taffy room.

39:50.764 --> 39:52.516
This is bollocks.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.101
(high-pitched whistle)

40:08.865 --> 40:10.408
This is the taffy room?

40:12.661 --> 40:15.997
An affordable alternative
to privatized health care.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.378
She's a dealer.

40:24.714 --> 40:26.133
(protesters shouting on video)

40:26.174 --> 40:27.968
All right,
everyone just calm down.

40:28.009 --> 40:30.095
Calm down.
Let's not let your hearts...

40:30.137 --> 40:32.055
Oh, you fucking...

40:32.097 --> 40:33.640
(video continues indistinctly)

40:33.682 --> 40:36.184
You guys,
you're the real heroes.

40:36.226 --> 40:37.644
(leather glove squeaking)

40:37.686 --> 40:39.146
(laughing):
You fucking...

40:39.187 --> 40:41.356
(laughing)

40:43.275 --> 40:44.359
Fuck, fuck. Fuck!

40:44.401 --> 40:46.486
(whimpers)

40:59.666 --> 41:01.793
No one ever said
the job was easy.

41:01.835 --> 41:03.503
MAN:
Look, he's just a kid.

41:03.545 --> 41:06.214
17 years old. You don't got
to look him in the face.

41:06.256 --> 41:09.676
STORMFRONT:
Look, no one's ever achieved
anything without sacrifice.

41:09.718 --> 41:10.969
The kid's a hero.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.721
Think of it like that.

41:12.762 --> 41:15.265
Right. A hero.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.189
-(phone beeps)
-(quietly): Okay.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.024
(knocking on door)

41:28.653 --> 41:30.030
Come in!

41:30.071 --> 41:31.448
(door opens)

41:43.418 --> 41:45.128
(Homelander chuckles)

41:45.170 --> 41:46.421
Where do you get all these?

41:46.463 --> 41:47.839
Oh, this is just
the first batch.

41:47.881 --> 41:49.382
I'll have Logan
punch up the fear.

41:49.424 --> 41:51.218
HOMELANDER: Logan?

41:51.259 --> 41:52.886
STORMFRONT: My meme-queen.

41:52.928 --> 41:55.055
-HOMELANDER: Hmm.
-So...

41:55.096 --> 41:57.432
when you see it
on your uncle's Facebook page,

41:57.474 --> 42:00.518
then you know it's working.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.562
Hmm.

42:03.813 --> 42:05.607
(chuckles softly)

42:05.649 --> 42:07.317
(crickets chirping)

42:07.359 --> 42:08.985
(clock ticking)

42:14.866 --> 42:17.369
(bird clock twittering)

42:17.410 --> 42:19.454
(twittering continues distantly)

42:21.623 --> 42:24.042
(gun clicking)

42:25.085 --> 42:27.087
(twittering stops)

42:31.841 --> 42:34.219
(clicking continues)

42:38.682 --> 42:40.350
Um...

42:40.392 --> 42:42.686
can I ask you something?

42:42.727 --> 42:46.314
(chuckles)
Well, suppose I got the time.

42:47.399 --> 42:48.858
(quietly):
Who's Lenny?

42:48.900 --> 42:50.360
You said I looked like him?

42:50.402 --> 42:52.112
Oh.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.781
Billy wouldn't want me to say.

42:56.533 --> 42:57.784
Fuck Billy.

42:57.826 --> 43:01.162
Lenny's his little brother.

43:01.204 --> 43:05.000
Uh, Butcher... has a brother?

43:05.041 --> 43:06.835
Yeah.

43:06.876 --> 43:09.212
Skinny, nervous little bugger.

43:09.254 --> 43:10.630
Like you.

43:10.672 --> 43:13.508
(both laugh softly)

43:13.550 --> 43:15.719
Fourth grade.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.888
Little wanker
named Dorian Savory

43:18.930 --> 43:20.515
breaks Lenny's nose.

43:20.557 --> 43:22.934
Oh, Billy goes to work on him.

43:22.976 --> 43:26.771
Was bringing the see-saw down
on Dorian's noggin, wham, wham!

43:26.813 --> 43:28.273
Probably gonna top him.

43:28.315 --> 43:31.067
Kids, teachers trying
to drag Billy away,

43:31.109 --> 43:33.528
but no... no good,
not gonna happen,

43:33.570 --> 43:35.322
Dorian's a goner.

43:35.363 --> 43:38.783
And then Lenny steps in,

43:38.825 --> 43:42.704
face all bleeding,
and leads Billy away

43:42.746 --> 43:46.916
easy, quiet as a lamb.

43:46.958 --> 43:49.419
That was Lenny.

43:49.461 --> 43:53.048
He had a way of making Billy
not be...

43:53.089 --> 43:57.385
(sighs)
well, you know... Billy.

44:01.264 --> 44:04.225
I think Billy needs someone
like that, you know?

44:08.063 --> 44:10.148
(sighs softly)

44:14.527 --> 44:16.488
Where's Lenny now?

44:16.529 --> 44:19.574
Oh, God rest his soul.

44:19.616 --> 44:21.076
What happened?

44:21.117 --> 44:23.161
(explosion)

44:23.203 --> 44:25.121
(Judy gasps)

44:25.163 --> 44:27.415
(Judy and Hughie shuddering)

44:30.668 --> 44:32.670
(footsteps overhead)

44:35.840 --> 44:37.300
(explosion)

44:47.477 --> 44:49.479
(footsteps resume overhead)

44:55.235 --> 44:57.237
(explosion)

45:11.000 --> 45:12.961
(Terror barks)

45:13.002 --> 45:14.254
Whoa-whoa-whoa...
(shushing)

45:14.295 --> 45:17.215
Easy, easy, Terror, easy. Easy.

45:17.257 --> 45:19.217
(shushing)

45:22.595 --> 45:25.140
(loud clattering)

45:25.181 --> 45:28.685
M.M.!
Come on, everybody, out!

45:34.566 --> 45:36.651
Out the side door!

45:36.693 --> 45:39.279
-Move!
-(Judy gasping)

45:44.409 --> 45:45.660
HUGHIE:
Butcher.

45:45.702 --> 45:47.328
Get 'em out of here.

45:47.370 --> 45:49.122
HUGHIE:
Butcher, wait, wait, wait!

45:49.164 --> 45:50.540
What are you...?

45:50.582 --> 45:53.835
-Butcher! Butcher!
-(door rattling)

45:53.877 --> 45:56.004
Butcher, what are you doing?!

45:56.045 --> 45:57.714
Butcher, you don't...

45:57.755 --> 45:59.549
Don't do this!

45:59.591 --> 46:00.967
Butcher!

46:01.009 --> 46:02.469
(glass shatters)

46:02.510 --> 46:05.388
All right, you fucker.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.432
Where are you?

46:20.695 --> 46:23.865
So you want to take me on,
do you?

46:23.907 --> 46:27.035
Think you got the bollocks?

46:27.076 --> 46:29.162
Well, come on, then...

46:29.204 --> 46:30.663
cunt.

46:34.417 --> 46:35.877
(loud crashing)

46:38.213 --> 46:39.297
What the fuck are you doing?!

46:39.339 --> 46:41.674
Get out of here!

46:41.716 --> 46:43.635
Oi, gimp cunt!

46:43.676 --> 46:46.262
Over here, gimp cunt!

46:46.304 --> 46:47.472
I'm the one you want.
Come here!

46:47.514 --> 46:49.224
(Hughie screaming)

46:53.311 --> 46:55.188
(grunting)

46:57.982 --> 46:59.984
(sound fades)

47:07.575 --> 47:09.994
(distorted barking)

47:13.873 --> 47:16.709
(high-pitched ringing)

47:26.094 --> 47:28.555
-(ringing stops)
-You kill him...

47:28.596 --> 47:31.182
and you can kiss
your fucking career goodbye.

47:35.603 --> 47:37.981
I got photos...

47:38.022 --> 47:40.233
of Vought's
dirty little secret--

47:40.275 --> 47:42.777
my wife's son...

47:42.819 --> 47:45.238
Homelander's son.

47:45.280 --> 47:49.158
Now, you lay one fucking finger

47:49.200 --> 47:51.369
on any of us,

47:51.411 --> 47:53.788
and those photos
go out of the cloud

47:53.830 --> 47:57.917
and into Ronan Farrow's inbox.

47:57.959 --> 48:00.211
And then the whole world
will know

48:00.253 --> 48:04.340
that Homelander is nothing
but a filthy fucking rapist

48:04.382 --> 48:09.554
and Vought has been hiding
his little laser-eyed bastard.

48:09.596 --> 48:14.267
Now, you cunts went to a lot of
trouble to keep that a secret.

48:14.309 --> 48:17.478
I reckon you might want
to keep it that way.

48:19.564 --> 48:21.274
(choking)

48:26.696 --> 48:29.616
("Hallelujah"
from Handel's Messiah playing)

48:31.618 --> 48:34.454
-♪ Halle... ♪

48:35.955 --> 48:37.582
EDGAR:
Mr. Butcher.

48:40.752 --> 48:43.004
-Oh, hello, cunt.
-How can I be sure

48:43.046 --> 48:45.423
you actually have the proof
of which you speak?

48:45.465 --> 48:46.591
BUTCHER:
You can't.

48:46.633 --> 48:48.676
Roll the dice, cunt.

48:48.718 --> 48:51.095
I reckon he'd be more popular

48:51.137 --> 48:53.556
than Meghan and Harry's
little sprog.

48:53.598 --> 48:55.767
Here's my first and final offer.

48:55.808 --> 48:58.353
That information
never sees the light of day,

48:58.394 --> 49:00.688
and I'll call off Black Noir.

49:00.730 --> 49:01.939
All right.

49:01.981 --> 49:03.858
You got yourself a deal.

49:03.900 --> 49:05.485
Want to shake on it?

49:05.526 --> 49:07.862
Put Noir on.

49:08.905 --> 49:11.866
Oi, missus wants a word.

49:15.036 --> 49:17.455
(gasps, grunts)

49:17.497 --> 49:20.416
(panting)

49:20.458 --> 49:22.960
Jesus Christ, Billy.

49:23.002 --> 49:25.505
(door opens)

49:25.546 --> 49:28.424
-M.M., you all right?
-I'm okay.

49:28.466 --> 49:29.884
(Billy sighs)

49:31.636 --> 49:34.722
HUGHIE:
Do you really have
those pictures?

49:34.764 --> 49:36.140
Of course I do.

49:36.182 --> 49:38.643
(labored breathing)

49:43.022 --> 49:44.982
(chuckles quietly)

49:45.024 --> 49:47.318
(indistinct chatter)

49:49.278 --> 49:51.406
They said there'd be food.

49:51.447 --> 49:54.742
Well, this is food
for your soul.

49:54.784 --> 49:56.786
Go with love.

49:56.828 --> 49:57.954
All right.

49:57.995 --> 49:59.414
Hi.

49:59.455 --> 50:01.124
Maeve, oh, my God. Hi.

50:01.165 --> 50:02.458
-What brought you here?
-Oh!

50:02.500 --> 50:03.918
Wait, are you...?

50:03.960 --> 50:05.503
Uh... do you want
to check this out?

50:05.545 --> 50:07.088
-Oh, fuck no. No.
-Okay.

50:07.130 --> 50:09.215
Listen, uh, we should talk.

50:09.257 --> 50:10.425
Yeah.

50:10.466 --> 50:13.052
If any of these Moonies

50:13.094 --> 50:14.470
are gonna help you
get back in The Seven,

50:14.512 --> 50:16.764
and that's a big if,

50:16.806 --> 50:19.434
then you're gonna need
a woman to...

50:19.475 --> 50:24.147
tell everyone that you're not
a complete piece of shit.

50:24.188 --> 50:26.607
I could be that person for you.

50:26.649 --> 50:28.192
Wait, you think
I'm a piece of shit?

50:28.234 --> 50:29.402
Fuck yeah.

50:29.444 --> 50:32.113
The point is, I can help you.

50:32.155 --> 50:33.823
If you help me.

50:33.865 --> 50:35.658
-Hmm.
-P.A.: Yeah,

50:35.700 --> 50:37.201
I've got Stormfront.
Flying in.

50:38.369 --> 50:40.580
WOMAN:
I'll take the goi cuon.

50:40.621 --> 50:42.582
Nah, no, the bun cha.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.000
Does that have peppers?

50:44.041 --> 50:45.418
Thank you.

50:48.921 --> 50:50.298
(knocks on door)

51:28.628 --> 51:30.046
(door opens)

51:32.715 --> 51:34.258
What are you doing
in my trailer?

51:34.300 --> 51:36.427
You know, you had no right

51:36.469 --> 51:39.347
to talk to my mother
about personal shit.

51:39.388 --> 51:41.599
What were you trying to prove?

51:41.641 --> 51:43.893
Okay, sorry.
Just trying to help.

51:43.935 --> 51:48.022
She didn't just lie to me
about Compound V, okay?

51:48.064 --> 51:52.151
She lied to me about everything.

51:52.193 --> 51:55.488
So don't try and broker
some kind of peace between us,

51:55.530 --> 51:59.116
because I don't want it.

51:59.158 --> 52:02.995
Wow, that-that...

52:03.037 --> 52:05.122
I mean...

52:05.164 --> 52:07.875
that...

52:07.917 --> 52:10.253
is a performance.

52:10.294 --> 52:14.090
Oh, my God, look,
I'm, like, tearing up.

52:14.131 --> 52:16.801
You don't suck, Starlight.

52:16.843 --> 52:19.846
You are Tilda fucking Swinton.

52:21.222 --> 52:23.599
I know you leaked it.

52:23.641 --> 52:26.269
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

52:26.310 --> 52:27.520
Not as good.

52:27.562 --> 52:28.896
Magic's gone.

52:28.938 --> 52:30.606
I guess lightning really
doesn't strike twice, huh?

52:30.648 --> 52:32.024
Okay, whatever. You know what?

52:32.066 --> 52:33.442
I need to get to set, so...

52:33.484 --> 52:35.862
That hack-a-limb Gecko,

52:35.903 --> 52:38.447
yeah, he stole the V
and then you...

52:38.489 --> 52:41.826
you leaked it to MSNBC.

52:41.868 --> 52:44.245
Now, what do you think Vought's
gonna feel when I tell them?

52:47.456 --> 52:50.084
Well, how do you think
the world will feel

52:50.126 --> 52:53.754
when I tell 'em
that you used to be Liberty?

52:54.797 --> 52:56.632
Wow.

52:56.674 --> 53:00.136
You are a special kind
of poison flower, huh,

53:00.177 --> 53:02.179
going against your own people?

53:02.221 --> 53:05.016
(scoffs)
You mean fucking white people?

53:05.057 --> 53:06.684
Starlight.

53:06.726 --> 53:08.102
Superheroes.

53:08.144 --> 53:09.729
Don't be racist.

53:12.106 --> 53:13.316
Oh, my.

53:13.357 --> 53:14.692
Oh, yes.

53:14.734 --> 53:16.736
That is adorable.

53:17.862 --> 53:18.988
I do like you.

53:19.030 --> 53:21.741
You... you got spunk.

53:21.782 --> 53:23.618
You're gonna be a big help
to me.

53:23.659 --> 53:25.620
-What the hell does that mean?
-(knocking on door)

53:26.662 --> 53:28.205
Come in!

53:34.879 --> 53:37.173
-Hello, you two.
-(door closes)

53:37.214 --> 53:39.508
(sighs)

53:39.550 --> 53:42.261
Not interrupting, am I?

53:42.303 --> 53:43.763
No.

53:43.804 --> 53:46.307
Just between us girls,
right, Starlight?

53:46.349 --> 53:48.434
Yeah.

53:48.476 --> 53:50.561
Yeah, that's right.

53:52.104 --> 53:54.565
-See you around.
-Mm-hmm.

53:54.607 --> 53:56.192
(door opens)

53:57.234 --> 53:59.070
Can't wait to shoot
our scene together.

53:59.111 --> 54:01.530
Yeah, me, too.

54:05.117 --> 54:06.410
(laughs softly)

54:06.452 --> 54:08.704
What was that all about?

54:08.746 --> 54:11.666
Are you girls friendly?

54:11.707 --> 54:13.042
No, just running lines.

54:13.084 --> 54:14.835
What's up?

54:14.877 --> 54:16.921
Uh...

54:16.963 --> 54:18.506
me.

54:18.547 --> 54:20.341
-Five points.
-Ah.

54:20.383 --> 54:21.676
Mm-hmm.

54:21.717 --> 54:23.135
(chuckles)

54:23.177 --> 54:25.429
Yeah, people are, uh,
checking boxes

54:25.471 --> 54:27.598
like "patriotic"

54:27.640 --> 54:31.268
and, uh... "unwavering."

54:34.730 --> 54:36.774
(breathes deeply)

54:36.816 --> 54:39.151
I owe you.

54:39.193 --> 54:42.405
Well, what are you
ever gonna do to repay me?

54:42.446 --> 54:44.949
(sirens wailing)

54:49.078 --> 54:51.539
Well...

54:51.580 --> 54:53.749
here we are.

54:54.917 --> 54:57.420
I'm sorry.

54:57.461 --> 55:01.173
I almost threw in the towel
like a bleeding twat.

55:01.215 --> 55:05.219
We're harder than that,
isn't we?

55:06.595 --> 55:09.849
I will get your mum back.

55:11.225 --> 55:14.437
I swear to God,
I'll get your mum back.

55:14.478 --> 55:16.772
Just take a little bit longer.

55:16.814 --> 55:19.984
You hang in there. All right?

55:20.026 --> 55:22.153
You be a good boy for Judy.

55:22.194 --> 55:24.447
(kisses)

55:24.488 --> 55:27.575
Yeah, that's a good lad.

55:32.747 --> 55:34.123
Oh.

55:35.583 --> 55:37.918
I almost forgot.

55:37.960 --> 55:40.421
I got you something.

55:41.505 --> 55:42.673
Terror...

55:44.133 --> 55:46.093
...fuck it.

55:46.135 --> 55:47.803
-(squeaking, thumping)
-That's my boy.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.847
HOMELANDER DOLL:
I'll always protect you.

55:51.307 --> 55:52.349
JUDY:
Mmm.

55:53.559 --> 55:54.769
(Terror panting)

55:54.810 --> 55:56.145
You're all right

55:56.187 --> 55:57.646
-for an old bat.
-Yeah, yeah.
