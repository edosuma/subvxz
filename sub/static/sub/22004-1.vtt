WEBVTT

00:05.389 --> 00:07.391
(laughter, screaming, whooping)

00:11.329 --> 00:13.965
(jazz music playing)

00:40.158 --> 00:42.160
Ten seconds.

00:43.061 --> 00:44.528
(guns clicking)

00:46.530 --> 00:49.400
(engine revving)

00:50.534 --> 00:53.838
(tires screeching)

00:53.872 --> 00:54.906
(truck horn blaring)

00:54.939 --> 00:56.507
(tires screeching)

00:57.241 --> 00:58.943
(screaming)

01:04.615 --> 01:06.450
(shrieking)

01:07.285 --> 01:09.453
(grunts)

01:17.561 --> 01:18.596
(grunts)

01:18.629 --> 01:20.298
Go! Go! Go!

01:25.636 --> 01:27.305
Go! Go! Go!

01:37.381 --> 01:38.516
Go now! Go! Go!

01:41.685 --> 01:44.488
(horn honking)

01:44.522 --> 01:46.290
(horn blaring)

01:46.324 --> 01:48.927
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:48.960 --> 01:51.529
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:51.562 --> 01:54.032
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:54.065 --> 01:55.333
* How, how, how, how

01:55.366 --> 01:57.902
* Hey, hey

02:03.607 --> 02:04.976
* You gotta come on.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.880
(music playing quietly)

02:11.149 --> 02:13.551
Ugh! All right.

02:13.584 --> 02:16.220
We're supposed to fill out these
witness statement forms now,

02:16.254 --> 02:17.655
but I can't find it.

02:17.688 --> 02:20.925
Try Form 5580/26e?

02:20.959 --> 02:22.927
I did, but nothing comes up.

02:22.961 --> 02:23.928
Did you forget the "E"?

02:23.962 --> 02:25.596
Can't forget the "E."

02:25.629 --> 02:27.398
I forgot the "E."

02:27.431 --> 02:28.666
Forget the "E" again, Percy,

02:28.699 --> 02:30.668
and I'm gonna
have to 5580/1 you.

02:32.170 --> 02:33.604
Agent Complaint Form.

02:33.637 --> 02:35.606
Do it and I'll smack you.

02:35.639 --> 02:37.708
I'm teasing.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.143
I'm not in the mood.
She's not in the mood.

02:39.177 --> 02:41.112
SONJA:
I'm just saying.

02:41.145 --> 02:44.282
We used to go to the bar
after closing a case.

02:44.315 --> 02:46.484
You know, have a little fun.

02:46.517 --> 02:48.319
Now we're stuck here,
filling out

02:48.352 --> 02:51.589
these stupid forms.
The bar exploded.

02:51.622 --> 02:52.957
That's not her point.
That's not my point.

02:52.991 --> 02:54.658
All right, you know what,

02:54.692 --> 02:56.995
you guys have been doing that a
lot lately, and it's real weird.

02:57.028 --> 02:58.029
Doing what?
Doing what?

03:00.198 --> 03:02.400
Regardless, I still think
this is temporary.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.202
It's all gonna
go back to normal soon.

03:04.235 --> 03:08.039
I don't know, Sebastian,
it's been over six weeks.

03:08.072 --> 03:11.042
This has to be about more
than HQ punishing us.

03:11.075 --> 03:12.676
They're not punishing us,
they're punishing Pride.

03:12.710 --> 03:14.712
Which is punishing us.

03:14.745 --> 03:18.049
I just wish he'd come back
already, and make it stop.

03:18.082 --> 03:20.051
Make our lives easier.

03:20.084 --> 03:22.353
Speaking of lives, you said
I could afford the Marigny.

03:22.386 --> 03:24.588
Even the one bedrooms
are out of my price range.

03:24.622 --> 03:25.689
Try the Bywater.
Try the Bywater.

03:26.624 --> 03:28.392
That is weird.

03:28.426 --> 03:29.693
Hey. It is all good.

03:29.727 --> 03:31.695
All right?
We don't have to do Cajun again.

03:31.729 --> 03:33.664
Look, next time, you choose.

03:33.697 --> 03:35.199
Surprise me.

03:35.233 --> 03:37.235
I'll call you later.

03:38.702 --> 03:40.238
LASALLE:
Boss here yet?

03:40.271 --> 03:42.706
Matter of fact, she is.
I swear to God,

03:42.740 --> 03:43.741
I don't see how
you people stay fit

03:43.774 --> 03:45.443
eating this crap all day.

03:45.476 --> 03:48.412
Last field office HQ sent me to
at least had jerky.

03:48.446 --> 03:50.248
(claps hands)
All right, let's roll,

03:50.281 --> 03:52.350
boys and girls,
we got us a big mishegas

03:52.383 --> 03:53.717
out on the Interstate
near Crowder,

03:53.751 --> 03:55.353
wherever the hell that is.

03:55.386 --> 03:57.121
Who's driving?

03:58.722 --> 03:59.723
(quietly):
Wow.

04:01.359 --> 04:03.361
(indistinct conversations,
radio chatter)

04:12.203 --> 04:14.038
BOYD:
All the vics Marines?

04:14.072 --> 04:16.174
Active Duty Reservists.
That's why we called you.

04:16.207 --> 04:18.042
Any other casualties, Captain?

04:18.076 --> 04:20.111
Other than a few civvies
who got injured when the rig

04:20.144 --> 04:21.545
slammed into their cars, no.

04:21.579 --> 04:23.147
Wow, what a mess.
Yeah.

04:23.181 --> 04:25.449
BOYD: Looks more like it does
a couple of thousand miles

04:25.483 --> 04:26.750
down the road.

04:26.784 --> 04:30.288
NCIS San Diego, my first
interim gig way back when,

04:30.321 --> 04:31.689
captain got canned,

04:31.722 --> 04:34.358
love triangle thing.
Moved on to Okinawa,

04:34.392 --> 04:35.726
straightened
that office out, too

04:35.759 --> 04:37.161
Great sushi,
not a fan of geisha girls.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.362
Eyewitnesses?

04:39.830 --> 04:42.100
Uh, yeah, pretty consistent.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.502
Panel van came up from behind,
forced the big rig to stop,

04:44.535 --> 04:46.570
four or five gunmen got out,
shot and killed the rig drivers,

04:46.604 --> 04:47.738
and then the trailing
SUV guards.

04:47.771 --> 04:49.473
So where's the rig?

04:49.507 --> 04:51.675
Oh, the gunmen dumped it
at the next off-ramp.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.211
Still trying to figure out
why they wanted it so bad.

04:53.244 --> 04:55.313
Lasalle, send some agents.
I want to know.

04:55.346 --> 04:56.714
Oh, Sebastian and Percy
are already there,

04:56.747 --> 04:57.815
Special Agent Boyd.

04:57.848 --> 04:59.217
We checked in
with NOPD,

04:59.250 --> 05:00.818
we wanted to get
a jump on things.

05:00.851 --> 05:02.253
You see, Pride likes us
to coordinate

05:02.286 --> 05:03.854
with each other
as much as possible.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.124
Local knowledge
is everything to him.

05:06.157 --> 05:07.758
Too bad following orders isn't,

05:07.791 --> 05:09.627
otherwise he wouldn't still
be on administrative leave,

05:09.660 --> 05:10.861
and I wouldn't be in charge.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.763
Check all the vics.

05:12.796 --> 05:14.498
I want to know what's
so special about the rig

05:14.532 --> 05:16.334
that it required armed escort.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.508
I like geisha girls.

05:26.810 --> 05:29.880
Tracheas, esophagus,
carotid and vertebral arteries.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.649
Bullet hits everywhere.

05:31.682 --> 05:33.517
Appears all four victims
met the same fate.

05:33.551 --> 05:35.419
Poor guys never had a chance.

05:35.453 --> 05:36.787
Ballistics?
No.

05:36.820 --> 05:39.657
Based on the bullet hits
and shell casings,

05:39.690 --> 05:41.425
definitely automatic fire.

05:41.459 --> 05:42.793
Probably MP5s.

05:42.826 --> 05:44.362
You run tests already?

05:44.395 --> 05:46.430
No, but unfortunately,

05:46.464 --> 05:48.866
I've had far too much experience
with the damn things.

05:48.899 --> 05:50.868
Yeah, well, something
doesn't add up.

05:50.901 --> 05:53.304
The heist was well-timed
and precise.

05:53.337 --> 05:56.707
But the firepower and wild
spray pattern was anything but.

05:56.740 --> 05:58.276
Yeah, so they weren't
well-trained.

05:58.309 --> 06:01.179
Yet, they executed a plan
to get what they wanted.

06:01.212 --> 06:03.214
Question is, what did they want?

06:03.247 --> 06:04.615
Well, that's the million
dollar question,

06:04.648 --> 06:06.750
even after inspecting
the big rig's trailer.

06:06.784 --> 06:10.188
Yep. Clean as a whistle,
as if nothing was ever inside.

06:10.221 --> 06:12.690
So, no indication
of anything stolen?

06:12.723 --> 06:14.292
Whatever it was,
it couldn't have been much,

06:14.325 --> 06:15.826
'cause other than a few
trace particles of dust,

06:15.859 --> 06:17.728
it was like a lab in there.

06:17.761 --> 06:20.464
Except the outside of the truck
was a whole different story.

06:20.498 --> 06:22.900
Yeah, obviously, not your
everyday Tonka toy, which,

06:22.933 --> 06:24.768
whoa, crazy Christmas flashback.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.237
I remember my Opa

06:26.270 --> 06:28.906
gave me his classic AA
Tonka Wrecker Tow, man.

06:28.939 --> 06:29.807
Loved that thing.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.309
Until I blew it up
with a cherry bomb.

06:31.342 --> 06:33.244
Sebastian.
Yeah. Sorry. The point is,

06:33.277 --> 06:36.547
this rig had, like,
countermeasures built into it.

06:36.580 --> 06:38.649
Shock-delivering systems,
bulletproof walls,

06:38.682 --> 06:40.584
axles designed to explode
so you couldn't tow it.

06:40.618 --> 06:42.953
So the only way they could
take it was to hijack it.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.223
Well, that explains
the armed escort.

06:45.256 --> 06:47.191
Yeah, but not
what they were escorting.

06:47.225 --> 06:48.759
Oh, can't you find out?

06:48.792 --> 06:50.928
Oh, yeah, we can
find out all right.

06:50.961 --> 06:52.896
We just have
to follow protocol,

06:52.930 --> 06:54.965
and run it up the flagpole
and get permission first.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.201
Special Agent Boyd
is kind of a stickler

06:57.235 --> 06:58.402
when it comes to rules
and regulations.

06:58.436 --> 07:00.338
SONJA:
And forms.

07:00.371 --> 07:01.572
Lots of forms.

07:01.605 --> 07:03.474
Well, that's ridiculous.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.309
Especially when you have
a situation

07:05.343 --> 07:07.177
where time's of the essence.

07:08.879 --> 07:10.080
I miss Pride.

07:13.951 --> 07:15.953
(tuning piano keys softly)

07:24.295 --> 07:25.829
(chuckles)

07:25.863 --> 07:26.997
I still don't see
why you went and bought

07:27.030 --> 07:29.233
another old, antique piano,

07:29.267 --> 07:30.668
knowing good and well
you almost went broke

07:30.701 --> 07:32.403
trying to fix the
last one all the time.

07:32.436 --> 07:34.405
Well, the last one meant a
lot to me, you know that.

07:34.438 --> 07:35.906
Lot of memories.

07:35.939 --> 07:37.541
Wanted to restore as
much of everything

07:37.575 --> 07:38.876
in this place as I could.

07:38.909 --> 07:41.279
History matters,
especially in this town.

07:41.312 --> 07:44.282
Yeah, good thing you had a lot
of time on your hands, too.

07:44.315 --> 07:45.349
Bar looks good.

07:45.383 --> 07:47.285
Look ready for reopening.

07:47.318 --> 07:49.019
And I got a great band lined up
to do exactly that.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.020
You're gonna love them.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.922
Yeah, that begs the question:

07:51.955 --> 07:53.291
what's next?

07:53.324 --> 07:55.593
What do you mean?
Come on, man,

07:55.626 --> 07:57.695
you know you gonna have to make
a decision sooner or later.

07:57.728 --> 08:01.265
I'm not signing HQ's
Personal Improvement Plan,

08:01.299 --> 08:02.333
if that's what you're implying.

08:02.366 --> 08:03.934
I didn't do anything wrong.

08:03.967 --> 08:06.003
No, look, you ain't
got to convince me.

08:06.036 --> 08:08.272
If it wasn't for you,
people would've died.

08:08.306 --> 08:09.940
And Mayor Hamilton's
corrupt butt

08:09.973 --> 08:12.042
would be running
for governor right now,

08:12.075 --> 08:14.312
instead of rotting
in somebody's prison.

08:14.345 --> 08:16.680
Still, you did

08:16.714 --> 08:18.982
sort of disobey a direct order.

08:19.016 --> 08:20.951
You know, almost getting
NCIS thrown out of the city...

08:20.984 --> 08:22.653
I remember, Patton.

08:22.686 --> 08:24.688
Come on...

08:24.722 --> 08:28.292
Look, all HQ wants you to do
is say you won't do it again.

08:28.326 --> 08:29.993
That's all.

08:30.027 --> 08:31.962
In fact, you don't have
to even really mean it.

08:31.995 --> 08:35.699
Patton, I know.

08:35.733 --> 08:38.035
I know you and
the team miss me.

08:38.068 --> 08:40.338
And I miss you guys, too,
believe me.

08:40.371 --> 08:42.706
But this isn't...

08:42.740 --> 08:45.343
It's not just about me being
willing to follow rules.

08:45.376 --> 08:46.710
It's not that simple.

08:46.744 --> 08:47.745
Why not?

08:48.779 --> 08:51.982
Come on, Pride.

08:52.015 --> 08:54.652
It's me, baby.

08:54.685 --> 08:57.355
Come on, man, you know, we've
been through a lot together now.

08:57.388 --> 08:59.557
Talk to me, man.

08:59.590 --> 09:02.059
I just I can't go back un...

09:02.092 --> 09:03.661
until I...

09:03.694 --> 09:05.095
Until what?

09:05.128 --> 09:07.731
You know I almost killed
Hamilton, right?

09:07.765 --> 09:10.100
Before I arrested him,
I almost pulled the trigger.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.935
But the point is you didn't.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.071
No, the point is
that I almost did.

09:14.104 --> 09:17.074
How I got to that place,

09:17.107 --> 09:20.378
I don't know,
even after all this time.

09:20.411 --> 09:21.812
But what I do know is,

09:21.845 --> 09:23.647
I don't ever want
to go there again.

09:23.681 --> 09:25.916
And I'm not
signing any papers

09:25.949 --> 09:27.351
until I can figure it out.

09:27.385 --> 09:28.452
Okay? I can't.

09:28.486 --> 09:29.920
King.

09:29.953 --> 09:31.622
(phone beeps)

09:34.558 --> 09:35.493
Duty calls?

09:35.526 --> 09:36.960
Yeah, man.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.962
Get out of here, would you?

09:38.996 --> 09:41.064
You got work to do.

09:41.098 --> 09:42.866
(door opens)

09:42.900 --> 09:44.101
PATTON:
What the hell?

09:44.134 --> 09:47.605
Look what somebody
did to your ride.

09:47.638 --> 09:49.072
Did they get the inside, too?

09:49.106 --> 09:51.709
No, thankfully.

09:51.742 --> 09:53.411
We might've just
chased them away.

09:53.444 --> 09:55.012
It's a damn shame.

09:55.045 --> 09:56.880
Everybody who's anybody knows

09:56.914 --> 09:59.082
this is your baby.
Yeah, well, maybe
that's the point.

09:59.116 --> 10:01.385
Wait, you know who did this?
No, but...

10:03.120 --> 10:04.888
...this isn't the first time
something like this

10:04.922 --> 10:06.457
has happened, lately.

10:06.490 --> 10:07.891
Started to think maybe
HQ's not the only one

10:07.925 --> 10:10.127
unhappy with me right now.

10:10.160 --> 10:10.994
Pride...
Look.

10:11.028 --> 10:14.898
Bringing Hamilton down
cost folks jobs.

10:17.435 --> 10:20.137
Guess I might not as popular
as I used to be, huh?

10:23.206 --> 10:26.410
Anyway, you, uh...

10:26.444 --> 10:28.045
you're good from here, right?

10:28.078 --> 10:30.448
Yeah.
Well, go learn things.

10:34.918 --> 10:37.421
Bad guys may not have
been trained for weapons,

10:37.455 --> 10:39.823
but they obviously knew exactly
where and when to attack.

10:39.857 --> 10:41.124
Timed it to take place

10:41.158 --> 10:44.127
in between the LSP patrol shifts
and traffic cams.

10:44.161 --> 10:46.029
Off-ramp where they
unloaded the big rig

10:46.063 --> 10:47.531
was under an overpass, too.

10:47.565 --> 10:49.833
Also outside of traffic
and surveillance cams,

10:49.867 --> 10:52.436
plus the adjacent highway
was closed for construction.

10:52.470 --> 10:55.706
Plenty of cover to get rid of
whatever it is they took

10:55.739 --> 10:58.442
and lots of escape routes
to flee the scene.

10:58.476 --> 10:59.877
Can't just be from
casing the area,

10:59.910 --> 11:01.912
has to be some local
knowledge, too,

11:01.945 --> 11:04.114
which means homegrown bad guys.

11:04.147 --> 11:05.148
Marines weren't
homegrown, though.

11:05.182 --> 11:06.584
They're from all over.

11:06.617 --> 11:08.151
They did have one thing
in common.

11:08.185 --> 11:10.120
They were assigned
to the Department of Energy?

11:10.153 --> 11:11.689
No, not just assigned.

11:11.722 --> 11:15.158
They were handpicked by the DoD,
CBRN warfare group.

11:15.192 --> 11:18.496
CBRN? Chemical, biological...

11:18.529 --> 11:20.163
Radiological and nuclear.

11:20.197 --> 11:22.533
It's not the best acronym,
but got even worse news.

11:22.566 --> 11:26.003
So, those, uh, particles
that I found in the big rig?

11:26.036 --> 11:27.838
Turns out that they had
elements of neutrons

11:27.871 --> 11:29.172
activated by exposure.

11:29.206 --> 11:32.009
In other words,
radioactive contamination.

11:33.210 --> 11:35.646
Nuclear waste.
That's what was stolen.

11:35.679 --> 11:37.681
Whoa. Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

11:37.715 --> 11:39.650
Are we infected?

11:39.683 --> 11:41.251
No, there was
only a trace amount

11:41.284 --> 11:42.853
and according
to my calculations,

11:42.886 --> 11:43.854
there wasn't even
that much raw waste inside.

11:43.887 --> 11:45.022
But...
LASALLE:
So, wait.

11:45.055 --> 11:47.190
DOE has been
transporting this stuff

11:47.224 --> 11:48.959
on a public highway?

11:48.992 --> 11:50.193
Yeah. And even scarier,

11:50.227 --> 11:52.863
they do it all the time,
all over the country.

11:52.896 --> 11:54.532
It's supposed to be
a covert fleet,

11:54.565 --> 11:56.066
but its obvious vulnerability
is that...

11:56.099 --> 11:58.636
Looks like we're dealing
with terrorists, people.

11:58.669 --> 12:00.738
Just in the SCIF with HQ,
found out that the big rig

12:00.771 --> 12:02.706
was from a subbase
and they were hauling...

12:02.740 --> 12:04.608
Radioactive waste,
we already know.

12:04.642 --> 12:06.977
How? I just got read in myself.

12:07.010 --> 12:09.212
We can't always wait to get
read in down here, ma'am.

12:09.246 --> 12:11.181
Oftentimes
when we do,

12:11.214 --> 12:13.116
it's too late to do
anything about it.

12:13.150 --> 12:15.285
Yeah, well, it's already
too late for us now.

12:15.318 --> 12:18.121
HQ wants me to turn this over
to the FBI, DHS.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.122
Wait, what? Why?

12:19.156 --> 12:20.257
Well, terrorists, nukes.

12:20.290 --> 12:22.125
It's their specialty, not ours.

12:22.159 --> 12:25.729
Yeah, well, it's our city
and our jurisdiction.

12:25.763 --> 12:27.565
Yeah, well, get over it.

12:27.598 --> 12:29.166
D.C. is taking the lead now.

12:29.199 --> 12:33.136
Pride wouldn't let
anybody else take the lead.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.606
Yeah, well, Pride isn't
here anymore, is he?

12:37.975 --> 12:41.679
You might want to start
getting used to that, too.

12:53.025 --> 12:55.027
(indistinct chatter)

13:03.936 --> 13:07.573
Lasalle, this is
Agent Lamont, DHS.

13:07.607 --> 13:08.908
He'll be taking
the lead from here.

13:08.941 --> 13:10.676
Agent Lasalle
is one of NCIS's

13:10.710 --> 13:12.945
best and brightest, rising star,
great teeth.

13:12.978 --> 13:14.914
He'll get you
everything you need.

13:14.947 --> 13:16.982
(laughs) I'm sorry to take over
your office like this, Lasalle.

13:17.016 --> 13:19.084
FBI Nola is overloaded.

13:19.118 --> 13:21.053
New Orleans, not Nola.

13:22.221 --> 13:24.089
It matters. Just saying.

13:24.123 --> 13:25.925
BOYD:
Anyway,

13:25.958 --> 13:27.760
you want to tell my team here
what you just told me?

13:27.793 --> 13:29.995
ISIS chatter
has been increasing.

13:30.029 --> 13:32.598
They've been targeting the
Office of Secure Transportation

13:32.632 --> 13:33.933
trucks for a while now.

13:33.966 --> 13:36.168
(chuckles)
Obviously not very secure.

13:36.201 --> 13:39.739
Patton. Continue.

13:39.772 --> 13:41.941
They're building a
dirty bomb, right?

13:41.974 --> 13:44.043
We think so. How did you know?

13:44.076 --> 13:46.211
Well, why else target trucks,
steal radioactive waste?

13:46.245 --> 13:47.747
SONJA:
Yeah.

13:47.780 --> 13:49.782
We got to get it back
somehow, too, fast.

13:49.815 --> 13:51.984
If they know what they're doing,
it won't be long for them

13:52.017 --> 13:53.285
to turn the material
into a bomb.

13:53.318 --> 13:54.787
PATTON:
We did a mock attack.

13:54.820 --> 13:56.255
Sebastian, show him.

13:56.288 --> 13:58.190
Right. So, as you know, uh,
it's not really the detonation

13:58.223 --> 13:59.158
that's the problem,
unless, of course,

13:59.191 --> 14:00.292
you're nearby
when it happens.

14:00.325 --> 14:03.062
PATTON: The radioactive cloud
is really the danger.

14:03.095 --> 14:04.730
Contaminate the city.

14:04.764 --> 14:06.031
But if we can figure out
where they're gonna get...

14:06.065 --> 14:07.800
They are not targeting
New Orleans.

14:07.833 --> 14:08.801
How do you know?

14:08.834 --> 14:10.135
ISIS chatter.

14:10.169 --> 14:12.037
Houston, Dallas,
maybe L.A., right?
Yeah.

14:12.071 --> 14:13.839
All we really know
for sure is that

14:13.873 --> 14:15.808
they've been targeting a major
Western city for months now.

14:15.841 --> 14:18.010
Yeah, but if you're wrong
about who's behind this,

14:18.043 --> 14:19.712
you could be wrong
about who the target is.

14:19.745 --> 14:21.180
LASALLE:
Right, and based on

14:21.213 --> 14:22.882
our preliminary
investigations,

14:22.915 --> 14:25.084
since local knowledge
was key into the attack,

14:25.117 --> 14:27.052
it could indicate we might be
dealing with a local group.

14:27.086 --> 14:28.854
They could still be
ISIS sympathizers.

14:28.888 --> 14:31.023
Look, all due respect,
I don't have time

14:31.056 --> 14:32.224
to download you all
on our intel,

14:32.257 --> 14:33.659
but it is substantial,

14:33.693 --> 14:35.728
believe me.
So, priority number one,

14:35.761 --> 14:38.598
contain the terrorists so they
don't reach their target cities.

14:38.631 --> 14:41.901
DHS and FBI have blocked all
the roads out of the state.

14:41.934 --> 14:43.168
Coast Guard already has helos up

14:43.202 --> 14:45.070
looking for radiation
signatures.

14:45.104 --> 14:47.673
You want me to get the Louisiana
National Guard to assist?

14:47.707 --> 14:50.175
Yeah, but do it on the QT. Hey.

14:50.209 --> 14:53.012
I don't want the media
involved on this.

14:53.045 --> 14:55.815
We don't need to create a panic.

15:03.188 --> 15:04.657
Even if they're right

15:04.690 --> 15:06.158
and New Orleans isn't
a primary target...

15:06.191 --> 15:08.093
It still could be
a secondary one.

15:08.127 --> 15:09.328
Right, 'cause even if they're
able to keep the bad guys

15:09.361 --> 15:11.163
from getting out of Louisiana,

15:11.196 --> 15:12.765
they might have no choice but
to target New Orleans instead.

15:12.798 --> 15:14.266
So, you sayin'
Homeland is willing

15:14.299 --> 15:16.335
to sacrifice us to save what?

15:16.368 --> 15:19.171
Dallas? Have they ever
even been to Dallas?

15:19.204 --> 15:20.606
LASALLE: All right, look.
Let's just think.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.141
All right, what would
Pride want us to do?

15:22.174 --> 15:24.043
He'd want us to pull
the fire alarm,

15:24.076 --> 15:25.244
get these people
the hell out of the office.

15:25.277 --> 15:27.179
He'd want us
to keep investigating

15:27.212 --> 15:28.648
and do whatever it takes.

15:28.681 --> 15:30.182
All right?
So let's get to work.

15:30.215 --> 15:32.117
But that dude,
he is right about one thing.

15:32.151 --> 15:34.219
We got to keep the panic
out of the streets,

15:34.253 --> 15:36.656
especially with the city's
tricentennial festivals

15:36.689 --> 15:37.857
and fireworks about to begin.

15:37.890 --> 15:39.692
We should start
with the panel van,

15:39.725 --> 15:41.193
the one the terrorists
used to stop the big rig.
GREGORIO: Right.

15:41.226 --> 15:43.162
So, a witness found
a partial plate

15:43.195 --> 15:45.865
that matches a stolen rental,
but Patton found

15:45.898 --> 15:47.132
a city cam shot of it

15:47.166 --> 15:48.901
parked out front of a building
on Decatur.

15:48.934 --> 15:50.335
No specific suspects,

15:50.369 --> 15:52.037
but one of the tenants
has a rap sheet.

15:52.071 --> 15:53.773
All right, you guys go.

15:53.806 --> 15:55.274
See what you can find,
but look, be careful.

15:55.307 --> 15:56.909
Full gear.
All right.

15:56.942 --> 15:58.644
Meanwhile, you two
monitor everything

15:58.678 --> 16:00.245
that comes in and out
of here, all right?

16:00.279 --> 16:01.747
We don't want DHS
overlooking something.

16:01.781 --> 16:03.082
Something like New Orleans?

16:03.115 --> 16:04.216
What are you gonna do?

16:04.249 --> 16:06.351
I'm gonna go talk
to Miss Loretta.

16:06.385 --> 16:08.721
See if she's interested
in getting Pride involved.

16:08.754 --> 16:11.090
What? I mean, A-A-Agent Boyd's
not gonna let him get involved,

16:11.123 --> 16:12.291
let alone HQ.

16:12.324 --> 16:15.127
Don't ask, don't tell.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.136
Terrance Deleon,
apartment 4V.

16:24.169 --> 16:27.673
Assault charges, civil
disobedience and spoiled brat.

16:27.707 --> 16:30.275
Trust fund baby,
fourth generation local.

16:30.309 --> 16:32.177
I.e., he's not your type.

16:32.211 --> 16:33.746
"My type"?
Who said I was looking?

16:33.779 --> 16:35.214
Oh, you're looking.

16:35.247 --> 16:36.816
You just need to get things
straight with Lasalle first.

16:36.849 --> 16:38.183
Hey. Hold up.
First of all,

16:38.217 --> 16:39.852
there's nothing
to get straight.

16:39.885 --> 16:40.986
We're just friends.

16:41.020 --> 16:42.688
Oh. Oh.
We're cool.
And second,

16:42.722 --> 16:44.790
stop profiling me.
It's creepy.

16:44.824 --> 16:46.125
Okay, whatever.

16:46.158 --> 16:47.960
But just so you know,
I got your back.

16:49.228 --> 16:50.262
Just saying.

16:52.497 --> 16:55.868
Terrance Deleon,
federal agents, open up.

16:57.202 --> 16:58.771
It's, like, a really
nice building.

16:58.804 --> 17:00.039
I wonder what
the rent is here.

17:00.072 --> 17:03.042
(scoffs)
Dream on.

17:03.075 --> 17:04.343
NCIS.

17:04.376 --> 17:05.745
You Mr. Deleone?

17:05.778 --> 17:08.113
Yeah. What's this about?

17:08.147 --> 17:09.314
This is about a stolen van

17:09.348 --> 17:10.916
outside your building
two days ago.

17:10.950 --> 17:12.284
Recognize it?

17:12.317 --> 17:14.253
Shoot.

17:27.299 --> 17:28.267
Whoa!

17:36.842 --> 17:38.310
Ah!

17:40.145 --> 17:41.380
Drop it!

17:54.359 --> 17:57.162
Hey, you good?

17:57.196 --> 17:58.898
Yeah.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.334
That was close.

18:06.505 --> 18:09.108
*

18:16.882 --> 18:19.318
* I put some sauce on it

18:19.351 --> 18:21.987
* I put my teeth upon it

18:22.021 --> 18:24.423
* I put some sauce on it

18:26.491 --> 18:29.061
* Here comes
your mother-in-law *

18:29.094 --> 18:31.030
* With that dried-up chicken
again *

18:31.063 --> 18:33.232
* Looking underneath the table

18:33.265 --> 18:35.234
* Calling for the family dogs

18:35.267 --> 18:38.003
* Spit it out in your napkin
* Oh, man

18:38.037 --> 18:40.539
* Got to deal
with the situation *

18:40.572 --> 18:42.574
* Firing it up right now

18:42.607 --> 18:44.409
* I'm picking up, still up

18:44.443 --> 18:47.379
* I'm breaking out flavor,
baby *
* Baby, baby. *

18:51.951 --> 18:53.919
Yeah, there it is.

18:53.953 --> 18:55.487
Come on now, everybody.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.258
Put the damn sauce on it.

18:59.291 --> 19:02.327
(Pride laughs)

19:02.361 --> 19:03.863
(whoops)

19:03.896 --> 19:05.064
Yeah.

19:06.065 --> 19:07.466
Be right back.

19:07.499 --> 19:09.969
Hey. Thank you, thank you.

19:10.002 --> 19:12.437
Hey, Loretta,
what are you doing here?

19:12.471 --> 19:14.940
You should've told me
you were coming.

19:14.974 --> 19:17.009
I wanted to surprise you.

19:17.042 --> 19:19.478
Well... (laughs)

19:19.511 --> 19:21.046
Mayor Taylor.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.481
Well, this is a surprise.

19:22.514 --> 19:25.284
Acting mayor, actually,
until the special election.

19:25.317 --> 19:27.019
Which Zahra is running for.

19:27.052 --> 19:28.187
Says you.

19:28.220 --> 19:31.323
You'd be a welcome change...

19:31.356 --> 19:33.225
especially after everything
the city has gone through.

19:33.258 --> 19:35.895
Although, seeing as how you
put our last mayor in jail...

19:35.928 --> 19:37.129
Oh, he deserved it.

19:37.162 --> 19:38.998
It wasn't a power struggle.

19:39.031 --> 19:41.200
So you keep telling me.
Look, Zahra,

19:41.233 --> 19:42.501
we've known each other
a long time,

19:42.534 --> 19:44.469
before I was a deputy

19:44.503 --> 19:46.371
and before you were
a councilwoman.

19:46.405 --> 19:48.307
I'm not a threat to you, Zahra.

19:48.340 --> 19:49.975
Promise.

19:50.009 --> 19:51.410
I just want what's
best for this city.

19:51.443 --> 19:53.913
Hamilton just wanted
what was best for him.

19:53.946 --> 19:56.548
I want what's best
for this city, too, Dwayne,

19:56.581 --> 20:01.020
and to do that, I need to change
its history of corruption,

20:01.053 --> 20:04.356
which means I need to look
at everyone and everybody

20:04.389 --> 20:06.358
to make sure they're not part
of the problem,

20:06.391 --> 20:08.060
and that includes you.

20:08.093 --> 20:11.530
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm all for it.

20:11.563 --> 20:13.498
But something tells me

20:13.532 --> 20:16.068
that's not what you came here
to talk to me about.

20:16.101 --> 20:19.104
Loretta?

20:21.140 --> 20:23.508
Christopher called,
off the record,

20:23.542 --> 20:25.911
said it was important,

20:25.945 --> 20:28.981
important enough for
me to involve her.

20:30.515 --> 20:32.551
He say what it was?

20:32.584 --> 20:38.357
He said the city might
be a terrorist target

20:38.390 --> 20:40.392
and that they need you.

20:40.425 --> 20:44.396
Okay, but what am
I supposed to do?

20:44.429 --> 20:47.132
NCIS put me on leave.

20:47.166 --> 20:49.701
Plus, I'm not exactly in
the right frame of mind to...

20:49.734 --> 20:53.438
Still, no one cares
more about New Orleans

20:53.472 --> 20:55.007
more than you do, Dwayne.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.342
Besides, being on leave
doesn't keep you

20:57.376 --> 20:58.510
from doing your civic duty,

20:58.543 --> 21:01.380
especially when
the city asks.

21:01.413 --> 21:03.515
And, since I'm the city now,

21:03.548 --> 21:05.417
I'm asking.

21:18.197 --> 21:19.498
What's going on?

21:19.531 --> 21:21.066
What's Captain Estes
doing here?

21:22.734 --> 21:24.569
You didn't tell them?

21:24.603 --> 21:26.305
Nah, I figured Pride wanted to.

21:26.338 --> 21:29.574
Mayor Taylor filled me in.

21:29.608 --> 21:32.211
Asked me to help Estes
and NOPD investigate.

21:32.244 --> 21:35.214
Sorry I've been MIA lately,
I just, you know...

21:35.247 --> 21:36.481
dealing with stuff.

21:36.515 --> 21:38.650
Hey,
we're just glad you're back.

21:38.683 --> 21:41.353
Yeah, does this mean you're not
on administrative leave anymore?

21:41.386 --> 21:44.456
No, I'm just acting
as a civilian here,

21:44.489 --> 21:45.657
helping out

21:45.690 --> 21:47.359
unofficially.

21:47.392 --> 21:49.061
I'm hoping that
you'll help, too,

21:49.094 --> 21:51.063
off the record.

21:51.096 --> 21:54.566
Meaning DHS and NCIS
can't know about it,

21:54.599 --> 21:56.235
for obvious reasons.

21:56.268 --> 21:58.470
Reasons being you'll get
fired if they find out, right?

21:58.503 --> 22:00.472
Not about me.

22:00.505 --> 22:03.108
Too much at stake here. I can't
just stand by and do nothing.

22:03.142 --> 22:05.310
That's music to our ears, King.

22:07.479 --> 22:10.582
Well...
(sighs)

22:10.615 --> 22:12.384
looks like we're going
rogue again.

22:25.433 --> 22:27.335
So how exactly is
this gonna work?

22:27.369 --> 22:30.037
I mean, isn't Special Agent Boyd
gonna wonder where we are?

22:30.071 --> 22:32.407
Are you kidding? She's probably
happy that we're not there

22:32.440 --> 22:35.042
driving DHS crazy
with all our nutty ideas.

22:35.076 --> 22:38.045
Look, you'll still be working
the case, developing leads.

22:38.079 --> 22:39.681
Don't withhold
anything from them.

22:39.714 --> 22:40.882
It wouldn't matter
if we did,

22:40.915 --> 22:42.450
they don't listen
to us anyway.

22:42.484 --> 22:43.918
Otherwise,
we wouldn't be here.

22:43.951 --> 22:45.620
Yeah, well, all that
matters is we find out

22:45.653 --> 22:48.656
what's really going on
and we stop it.

22:48.690 --> 22:51.759
Doesn't matter who's right,
or who gets the credit.

22:51.793 --> 22:54.762
Yeah, but what if we find proof
that New Orleans is the target

22:54.796 --> 22:56.063
and Homeland doesn't believe us?

22:56.097 --> 22:57.665
Then we'll have to
handle it ourselves,

22:57.699 --> 22:58.966
with NOPD.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.935
Sebastian, how long's it take

23:00.968 --> 23:03.471
to turn radioactive waste
into a dirty bomb?

23:03.505 --> 23:05.006
I mean, if you know
what you're doing,

23:05.039 --> 23:06.508
and we have to assume
that they do,

23:06.541 --> 23:07.909
I don't know,
a day, max?

23:07.942 --> 23:09.877
But you got to build
a detonator, too, though.

23:09.911 --> 23:11.946
You got to build them
both together, depending on

23:11.979 --> 23:13.781
how and where they
decide to explode it

23:13.815 --> 23:15.082
over the city.
Question is,
how are they building it

23:15.116 --> 23:16.718
without being detected?

23:16.751 --> 23:18.653
Other than Shreveport,
DHS lost their trail

23:18.686 --> 23:20.455
right after the heist.

23:20.488 --> 23:22.990
Maybe Deleon's laptop can help
give us some answers.

23:23.024 --> 23:25.126
Wait, how did you
get Deleon's laptop?

23:25.159 --> 23:28.129
Oh, um, we took it

23:28.162 --> 23:29.931
after we shot him.

23:29.964 --> 23:31.566
GREGORIO:
And forgot to

23:31.599 --> 23:33.535
turn it in to Homeland,
but it's just...

23:33.568 --> 23:34.902
Yeah, I'm not hearing
any of this.
No, absolutely.

23:34.936 --> 23:36.003
Okay, ladies.
All right.

23:36.037 --> 23:38.039
go get it and
bring it back here.

23:39.541 --> 23:40.908
And, Patton,
you're gonna tear it apart.

23:40.942 --> 23:42.009
You got it, boss.

23:42.043 --> 23:43.745
Crack-a-hacker
open for business.

23:43.778 --> 23:45.413
All right, I'll continue
to coordinate with NOPD,

23:45.447 --> 23:46.781
set up a secure line
here at the bar.

23:46.814 --> 23:48.916
Thanks, Carl.
Yeah.

23:48.950 --> 23:50.985
LASALLE: Hey, one
more thing, King.

23:51.018 --> 23:52.587
We're kind of
flying blind here

23:52.620 --> 23:55.056
without access to all
the intel DHS is getting.

23:55.089 --> 23:56.891
Sebastian and I will head
back to the Squad Room

23:56.924 --> 23:58.893
and feed it to you.
No, no, no, it's too risky.

23:58.926 --> 24:01.463
If Boyd finds out
you're working with me,

24:01.496 --> 24:03.465
won't just be
my job on the line.

24:03.498 --> 24:05.733
Yeah, but, wait,
if we can get into SCIF,

24:05.767 --> 24:07.201
then we could set up
a secure line back to here,

24:07.234 --> 24:09.103
gain access,
she'd never even know.

24:09.136 --> 24:10.505
I like it. Let's go.

24:10.538 --> 24:12.106
Now, hold on. Stay here,

24:12.139 --> 24:13.140
get Patton set up.

24:13.174 --> 24:14.642
I'll go.

24:14.676 --> 24:17.078
Wait, wait, what
about Agent Boyd?

24:17.111 --> 24:18.613
She's not gonna be
very happy to see you.

24:18.646 --> 24:20.047
Yeah, well, there are
a few people around town

24:20.081 --> 24:22.116
that aren't happy to see me
right now.

24:22.149 --> 24:23.785
I'll handle Boyd.

24:37.264 --> 24:39.100
PRIDE:
Old remote.

24:39.133 --> 24:41.102
Lost the new one
a couple months ago.

24:41.135 --> 24:43.838
Been meaning to
replace it. May I?

24:43.871 --> 24:45.873
You got to input VCR first,

24:45.907 --> 24:47.174
even though I know
it's not a VCR

24:47.208 --> 24:48.776
and you're probably
too young to know

24:48.810 --> 24:50.878
what I'm even talking
about. Anyway...

24:51.913 --> 24:52.880
There you go.

24:52.914 --> 24:54.115
All set.

24:54.148 --> 24:55.617
Thanks.
Yeah.

25:03.758 --> 25:05.092
BOYD:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:05.126 --> 25:06.160
You're not supposed
to be here, Dwayne.

25:06.193 --> 25:08.062
You need to leave now.

25:08.095 --> 25:09.931
I know, sorry, I'm just--
I'm running out of clothes,

25:09.964 --> 25:11.132
I just need a couple
clean shirts.

25:11.165 --> 25:13.067
Well, how about a couple
quarters instead,

25:13.100 --> 25:15.903
for the Laundromat?

25:15.937 --> 25:17.171
You're not still mad
about what happened

25:17.204 --> 25:18.773
all those years ago
in training, are you?

25:18.806 --> 25:20.742
You mean when you cheated?
I improvised.

25:20.775 --> 25:22.777
You broke the rules.
Did what it took.

25:22.810 --> 25:24.245
Apparently,
some things never change.

25:25.279 --> 25:27.214
Look, let's be honest,

25:27.248 --> 25:29.116
if you really wanted to
come back,

25:29.150 --> 25:31.986
you would've signed HQ's
stupid piece of paper

25:32.019 --> 25:33.054
promising to be a good scout

25:33.087 --> 25:35.222
a long time ago.
Sorry?

25:35.256 --> 25:38.125
I've been around, I've seen it
before with other agents.

25:38.159 --> 25:40.161
It's called "burnout."

25:40.194 --> 25:43.531
(chuckles)
I read the FBI report
on your last case.

25:43.565 --> 25:45.132
Something happened to you,
didn't it?

25:45.166 --> 25:46.834
You're not even sure
if you really

25:46.868 --> 25:48.135
want to come back
anymore, are you?

25:48.169 --> 25:49.136
You don't know me.

25:49.170 --> 25:50.204
Maybe, maybe not.

25:50.237 --> 25:52.306
I do know one thing:

25:52.339 --> 25:54.141
you put together
a hell of a team.

25:54.175 --> 25:56.544
Top-notch.

25:56.578 --> 25:59.046
They deserve someone who
really wants to be here.

25:59.080 --> 26:02.249
Got anybody in mind?

26:04.318 --> 26:06.287
I wouldn't get too comfortable.

26:09.056 --> 26:11.058
You got five minutes, Dwayne.

26:20.735 --> 26:22.770
(beeping, trilling)

26:22.804 --> 26:25.039
SEBASTIAN: Oh, awesome,
you did it, Pride. That's great.

26:25.072 --> 26:26.741
Did, uh, Agent Boyd
give you any crap?

26:26.774 --> 26:28.876
Nothing I can't handle.

26:28.910 --> 26:32.213
And you should now have
full access,

26:32.246 --> 26:34.181
including the fact
that DHS did lose

26:34.215 --> 26:35.950
the radioactive trail
after Shreveport.

26:35.983 --> 26:37.752
Told 'em, decoy.

26:37.785 --> 26:39.186
Let's backtrack.

26:39.220 --> 26:40.788
Check the last
hits they got in the city.

26:40.822 --> 26:42.323
See if we can't figure out
where they were headed.

26:42.356 --> 26:43.958
PATTON:
I may not know that yet,

26:43.991 --> 26:45.326
but I do know
how and when they knew

26:45.359 --> 26:47.094
which big rig to attack.

26:47.128 --> 26:49.196
Apparently, Deleon was a bit of
a hacker himself.

26:49.230 --> 26:51.132
He broke into the DOE's

26:51.165 --> 26:52.967
classified systems.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.035
And downloaded
the nation's entire

26:54.068 --> 26:54.969
classified nuke
truck routes.

26:55.002 --> 26:58.139
But specifically targeted
the one near us,

26:58.172 --> 26:59.774
even though we know, obviously,

26:59.807 --> 27:01.643
there are more vulnerable routes
in the Texas panhandle.

27:01.676 --> 27:04.211
Which they'd do if Dallas
or L.A. was their target.

27:04.245 --> 27:06.180
More evidence we are.
The question is,

27:06.213 --> 27:08.215
where and when
are they gonna strike?

27:08.249 --> 27:10.952
Might help if we can figure out
why the radioactive trail

27:10.985 --> 27:12.987
suddenly disappeared.

27:13.020 --> 27:14.722
(computer beeps)

27:14.756 --> 27:17.659
Maybe they went underground.

27:17.692 --> 27:18.893
GREGORIO:
Underground?

27:18.926 --> 27:20.261
SONJA:
The old Rivergate.

27:20.294 --> 27:22.797
If we're dealing with
a local terrorist group,

27:22.830 --> 27:24.265
they'd know all about it.

27:24.298 --> 27:27.234
City had the idea to
bring the interstate

27:27.268 --> 27:29.170
through the Quarter
50 years ago,

27:29.203 --> 27:30.972
but the residents
were having none of it.

27:31.005 --> 27:33.374
LASALLE: Yep, so they decided
to go underground, instead.

27:33.407 --> 27:35.176
Pumped out the groundwater,

27:35.209 --> 27:37.912
buttressed walls, hoping to
build a six-lane tunnel.

27:37.945 --> 27:39.380
But the streets above buckled,

27:39.413 --> 27:41.849
preservationists complained,
so they abandoned it.

27:41.883 --> 27:44.418
When the casino got built, they
turned it into a parking lot.

27:44.451 --> 27:46.788
Which would make it the perfect
place to hide nuke waste

27:46.821 --> 27:49.056
from monitors.
All right. Good job.

27:49.090 --> 27:50.725
Okay.

27:50.758 --> 27:52.093
We have, uh, cleared the lot,

27:52.126 --> 27:53.127
sealed off both entrances
just to be safe.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.395
All right, good.
This way.

27:57.098 --> 27:58.632
Pride.

28:00.401 --> 28:01.836
My personal weapon.

28:04.205 --> 28:06.407
Just in case you need to
make a citizen's arrest.

28:06.440 --> 28:08.710
Thanks, Carl.

28:12.980 --> 28:15.282
(Geiger counter
beeping steadily)

28:15.316 --> 28:16.984
That thing better work.

28:17.018 --> 28:18.152
I don't want to stumble
across something

28:18.185 --> 28:19.320
and start glowing
in the dark.

28:19.353 --> 28:20.922
Yeah, but on the plus side,
you know,

28:20.955 --> 28:22.156
maybe we'll all get
super powers.

28:22.189 --> 28:23.891
That's not funny.

28:29.063 --> 28:31.132
GREGORIO: Anything?
SEBASTIAN: Uh-- that's like
the fifth time

28:31.165 --> 28:32.366
you've asked me, all right?
You're driving me nuts!

28:32.399 --> 28:33.701
Shh!
Hey.

28:33.735 --> 28:35.036
Up ahead.

28:35.069 --> 28:36.337
What's that?

28:49.416 --> 28:50.852
(Geiger counter continues
beeping steadily)

28:50.885 --> 28:52.887
Low levels of radiation.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.422
Well within the safe zone.
We're good.

28:55.456 --> 28:57.191
The bad guys were definitely
here, though.

28:57.224 --> 28:58.425
No doubt about that.

28:58.459 --> 29:00.027
Making the dirty bomb?

29:00.061 --> 29:01.729
Looks like it.

29:01.763 --> 29:04.265
Ten bucks says that's
potassium nitrate.

29:04.298 --> 29:05.800
Sulfur, too.

29:05.833 --> 29:07.034
The detonator?

29:07.068 --> 29:08.402
Most likely.

29:08.435 --> 29:10.304
So, what, they're done?

29:10.337 --> 29:12.439
Dirty bomb, detonator?
What are we supposed to do?

29:14.776 --> 29:16.410
Kiss our asses good-bye?

29:27.091 --> 29:29.093
*

29:30.794 --> 29:32.796
(indistinct chatter)

29:38.435 --> 29:39.803
Everybody listen up!

29:39.836 --> 29:42.306
Sorry, no time for pleasantries
or protocol.

29:42.339 --> 29:45.209
Folks, we all need to work
together fast.

29:45.242 --> 29:46.576
Who the hell are you?

29:46.610 --> 29:48.378
Special Agent Dwayne Pride,
NCIS.

29:48.412 --> 29:50.147
Yeah, he's the boss
around here.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.648
Not anymore, he's not.

29:51.681 --> 29:53.450
Leave now or I'll report you.

29:53.483 --> 29:55.152
Go ahead.

29:55.185 --> 29:56.586
You in charge?

29:58.288 --> 29:59.489
DHS, Agent Lamont.

29:59.523 --> 30:01.458
All right, Agent Lamont,

30:01.491 --> 30:04.661
I can download you on the
specifics, but I'm telling you,

30:04.694 --> 30:05.795
it's not ISIS,

30:05.829 --> 30:07.631
it's not Dallas or L.A.

30:07.664 --> 30:09.633
It's homegrown,
it's New Orleans,

30:09.666 --> 30:12.169
and it's imminent,
otherwise I wouldn't be here

30:12.202 --> 30:13.270
risking my career.

30:14.871 --> 30:16.773
Oh, don't worry,

30:16.806 --> 30:19.743
Sebastian said the radiation
levels probably aren't lethal.

30:19.776 --> 30:20.610
What is this?

30:20.644 --> 30:23.847
Proof that we know
what we're doing.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.349
Which means,
the only question is,

30:25.382 --> 30:27.217
do you want to believe
your chatter,

30:27.251 --> 30:28.318
or you want to
believe us?

30:30.354 --> 30:31.688
I'm listening.

30:31.721 --> 30:33.357
Let's go.

30:33.390 --> 30:35.225
My team is inputting
what we found

30:35.259 --> 30:37.294
so you're up to speed,
but we need you

30:37.327 --> 30:38.362
just as much
as you need us

30:38.395 --> 30:40.430
if we're going to stop

30:40.464 --> 30:41.698
the real terrorists.

30:41.731 --> 30:43.233
Who's coordinating
the helos?

30:43.267 --> 30:44.334
I am.

30:44.368 --> 30:46.370
Redirect them
and their monitors

30:46.403 --> 30:48.238
back to New Orleans, stat.

30:48.272 --> 30:49.038
GARCIA:
Sir?
Yeah.

30:49.072 --> 30:52.842
Gregorio,
work with DHS profilers.

30:52.876 --> 30:54.211
We need to find out
who we're up against.

30:54.244 --> 30:55.412
On it.
Upstairs.

30:55.445 --> 30:57.247
Percy.

30:57.281 --> 30:58.848
Tap into Homeland

30:58.882 --> 31:01.918
and FBI databanks,
get more on Deleon.

31:01.951 --> 31:04.221
We need to know who
he was working with.

31:04.254 --> 31:05.589
I'll get you access.

31:06.923 --> 31:08.592
Come on.

31:11.328 --> 31:13.630
My forensic agent is breaking
down the detonator materials.

31:13.663 --> 31:15.299
Might make it easier
for us to figure out where

31:15.332 --> 31:16.433
and when they're gonna
set off the bomb.

31:16.466 --> 31:17.701
Can you and your team

31:17.734 --> 31:20.304
start working likely
local scenarios

31:20.337 --> 31:21.771
so that we can narrow
the attack down?

31:21.805 --> 31:25.375
Yeah. Jackson, Pierce, with me.
Excuse me.

31:27.211 --> 31:29.613
Good to see you back
in the saddle again, King.

31:29.646 --> 31:33.283
I gotta say...
I missed it.

31:35.985 --> 31:38.488
MAN (on radio):
This is CGIS helo 23 Niner.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.324
SARSAT and SAR CM active.

31:40.357 --> 31:41.691
Radiation negative. Over.

31:41.725 --> 31:43.327
GARCIA:
Copy that, 23 Niner.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.362
Continue search pattern
and advise. Over.

31:45.395 --> 31:46.663
MAN:
Roger, base. Copy that.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.915
(blade rings, man grunts)

32:05.949 --> 32:07.584
Get the bomb.
Keep it dry.

32:09.686 --> 32:11.821
We got something. Sonja's
still deep diving Deleon,

32:11.855 --> 32:13.657
but we got a hit from
the Treasury Department.

32:13.690 --> 32:16.826
Turns out our little trust fund
baby, Deleon, has been secretly

32:16.860 --> 32:18.862
laundering money to a group
called Endnukes.

32:18.895 --> 32:21.431
More than just the funding.
According to DoD's

32:21.465 --> 32:22.599
Biometric ID System,

32:22.632 --> 32:23.733
he's been linked to an attack

32:23.767 --> 32:25.469
at the White Sands nuclear site.

32:25.502 --> 32:26.936
Same place
the leader of the group,

32:26.970 --> 32:28.472
Armand Pritchett, was arrested.

32:28.505 --> 32:30.240
FBI lists Endnukes
as a radicalized

32:30.274 --> 32:31.575
domestic terrorist group.

32:31.608 --> 32:33.410
With the stated goal
of doing whatever it takes

32:33.443 --> 32:34.511
to get rid of the nukes.

32:34.544 --> 32:36.012
Including sacrificing a city

32:36.045 --> 32:37.447
to prove how dangerous they are.

32:37.481 --> 32:39.316
Not just any city,
our city.

32:39.349 --> 32:41.951
Hey, guys,
so talk about karma.

32:41.985 --> 32:43.587
Do you remember that
cherry bomb incident

32:43.620 --> 32:44.688
that I told you about
back when I was a kid?

32:44.721 --> 32:45.589
Sebastian!
Sebastian!

32:45.622 --> 32:47.023
Okay, he thinks

32:47.056 --> 32:48.458
they're gonna use
the fireworks

32:48.492 --> 32:49.793
to detonate the bomb,
Dwayne.

32:49.826 --> 32:51.428
SEBASTIAN: Well, except
I don't think, I know.

32:51.461 --> 32:53.363
The powder and materials
that we found in the tunnel

32:53.397 --> 32:55.765
are the exact elements needed
to launch fireworks.

32:55.799 --> 32:58.402
Well, it makes sense.
Exploding the radioactive cloud

32:58.435 --> 33:00.604
high in the sky
gets maximum dispersion.

33:00.637 --> 33:02.606
Are there fireworks tonight?

33:02.639 --> 33:04.374
Yeah, the Tricentennial kickoff
on the river.

33:04.408 --> 33:06.876
Less than an hour from now.

33:06.910 --> 33:09.446
I'll call the FBI, SWAT...
No, you can't.

33:09.479 --> 33:11.648
Any show of force might
make them detonate the bomb

33:11.681 --> 33:13.617
before we even have
a chance to stop them.

33:13.650 --> 33:16.520
He's right.

33:16.553 --> 33:17.821
So what do you have
in mind?

33:20.424 --> 33:22.426
(fireworks exploding,
lively jazz music playing)

33:31.401 --> 33:33.503
Excuse me, sir.

33:42.912 --> 33:44.714
NCIS.
Federal agents.

33:44.748 --> 33:46.416
Sorry to do this
to you, Captain,

33:46.450 --> 33:47.451
but do you see that

33:47.484 --> 33:49.319
fireworks barge out there?

33:49.353 --> 33:50.554
Yes, sir.
I need you to get us

33:50.587 --> 33:52.456
as close to it
as you can ASAP,

33:52.489 --> 33:53.923
or we're all dead.

33:53.957 --> 33:56.593
Understand?
Yes, sir.

34:15.361 --> 34:16.895
If Sebastian's right,
they'll wait

34:16.928 --> 34:18.597
till the big finale
to detonate.

34:18.630 --> 34:20.499
They'll maximize the spread,
the wind will take

34:20.532 --> 34:24.670
the radioactive cloud
right over the Quarter.

34:24.703 --> 34:26.905
Get us as close
as you can.

34:26.938 --> 34:28.874
We'll let the current
do the rest.

34:28.907 --> 34:30.709
It's a long shot, King.

34:30.742 --> 34:32.911
Still, the fireworks won't
last that much longer.

34:32.944 --> 34:34.713
After we leave,
take this boat

34:34.746 --> 34:37.549
and get as far away from here
as fast as you can.

34:37.583 --> 34:39.751
Let's get wet.

34:39.785 --> 34:41.853
(crowd cheering)

34:45.857 --> 34:47.893
(whistling, exploding)

35:09.915 --> 35:11.483
Pritchett!

35:28.267 --> 35:29.335
Go.

35:33.805 --> 35:35.874
(gunfire continues)

35:47.018 --> 35:48.520
NCIS. Hands up!

36:06.538 --> 36:08.440
(gunfire, bullets ricocheting)

36:10.008 --> 36:11.743
Come with me.

36:13.445 --> 36:15.414
(gunfire continues)

36:22.721 --> 36:24.723
(screaming)

36:37.969 --> 36:39.905
Thanks.

36:39.938 --> 36:42.774
I never really liked
fireworks anyway.

36:42.808 --> 36:44.310
(chuckles)

36:44.343 --> 36:45.711
(whistling, exploding)

36:47.846 --> 36:49.648
(sighs)

37:00.526 --> 37:02.461
MAN: That's a local
New Orleans office...

37:02.494 --> 37:04.830
(indistinct chatter)

37:07.499 --> 37:09.368
Welcome back, boss.

37:09.401 --> 37:11.503
Yeah. Thank you, Roy.

37:11.537 --> 37:14.640
Just hope I'm ready
to be back.

37:14.673 --> 37:16.708
There's only one way
to find out.

37:16.742 --> 37:18.377
Yeah.

37:22.448 --> 37:25.751
Oh. Full of surprises,
aren't you, Dwayne?

37:25.784 --> 37:27.919
How's that?
I didn't expect you

37:27.953 --> 37:29.555
to actually sign
the paper.

37:29.588 --> 37:31.857
Promise HQ
you'd toe the line,

37:31.890 --> 37:34.025
follow orders.
Yeah, well,

37:34.059 --> 37:36.395
the bar's almost done,
about to reopen.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.397
I guess I was worried
I'd get a little bored.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.732
(chuckles) You and I both know
that that's a crock.

37:40.766 --> 37:42.501
You miss the action.

37:42.534 --> 37:44.436
You miss being part
of something bigger.

37:44.470 --> 37:46.472
Nothing you can do
about it.

37:46.505 --> 37:48.774
You're hard-wired
for it, you know?

37:48.807 --> 37:50.709
I saw that when we met.

37:50.742 --> 37:52.411
Maybe you do know me.

37:52.444 --> 37:55.481
Oh, I know you, all right.

37:55.514 --> 37:57.349
I know that just 'cause
you told HQ

37:57.383 --> 37:59.985
what they wanted to hear
doesn't change a thing.

38:00.018 --> 38:01.987
Doesn't change whatever
rocked you

38:02.020 --> 38:03.555
when you took down Hamilton,

38:03.589 --> 38:05.491
and it doesn't change the fact

38:05.524 --> 38:06.758
that it'll bite you
in the ass again

38:06.792 --> 38:09.495
if you don't
figure it out.

38:09.528 --> 38:12.564
No, it's just a matter of time.

38:15.401 --> 38:17.636
Don't get too comfortable.

38:26.645 --> 38:28.747
Hey, what up?

38:28.780 --> 38:30.916
Hey, Perc, thanks
for coming, baby.

38:30.949 --> 38:32.083
Yeah, sure.

38:32.117 --> 38:34.520
Just why, though?

38:34.553 --> 38:35.721
I mean, the case
is closed.

38:35.754 --> 38:37.423
There's nothing more
for us to do.

38:37.456 --> 38:39.591
Is there?
Isn't there?

38:39.625 --> 38:41.059
Uh, I don't know.
You tell me.

38:41.092 --> 38:42.494
I mean, look at this place.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.830
It's perfect.
Perfect for what?

38:44.863 --> 38:47.165
To rent, to live in.
I mean, yeah,

38:47.198 --> 38:48.400
there are a couple of
bullet holes in the walls

38:48.434 --> 38:50.636
and some blood on the carpet,
but we'll call a priest in,

38:50.669 --> 38:51.637
he'll exorcise the place.

38:51.670 --> 38:53.572
Plus, the landlord said

38:53.605 --> 38:56.107
he's willing to re-patch and
paint and change the carpet.

38:56.141 --> 38:58.076
Are you out of your mind,
Gregorio?

38:58.109 --> 38:59.878
What?
I mean, aside
from the fact that

38:59.911 --> 39:02.113
a man was actually
killed here...

39:02.147 --> 39:04.716
Oh, stop. By us.
Not the point. Besides,

39:04.750 --> 39:07.553
you can't begin to think you can
afford a place like this.

39:07.586 --> 39:09.755
No, you're right, I can't.

39:09.788 --> 39:11.523
But we can.

39:11.557 --> 39:13.559
We?
Don't talk.
Listen for a second.

39:13.592 --> 39:15.594
The landlord's willing
to lower the rent.

39:15.627 --> 39:17.763
Because, as you said, who else
is gonna rent a place like this

39:17.796 --> 39:18.897
where a guy was
just shot to death?

39:18.930 --> 39:20.566
He's desperate.
Yeah, but...

39:20.599 --> 39:22.568
Secondly, there are
two bedrooms.

39:22.601 --> 39:23.902
Okay, so if you and I
split the rent,

39:23.935 --> 39:26.438
it'll still be cheaper
than that crappy place

39:26.472 --> 39:28.607
you're paying for now.

39:29.741 --> 39:30.709
You starting to feel it?

39:30.742 --> 39:32.043
You starting to see it?
Ehh...

39:32.077 --> 39:33.545
Come on, it'll be
so much fun.

39:33.579 --> 39:36.582
Forget Lasalle, we'll take
this place by storm.

39:36.615 --> 39:38.149
We'll be like
Laverne and Shirley.

39:40.018 --> 39:42.954
I mean...

39:42.988 --> 39:44.623
ehh.

39:44.656 --> 39:46.492
Come on.
Meh.

39:46.525 --> 39:48.059
Huh?
Yeah.

39:48.093 --> 39:50.161
Yeah?
Yes.

39:50.195 --> 39:52.664
But who's Laverne and Shirley?

39:54.132 --> 39:56.167
Maybe it's not
gonna work, actually.

40:02.974 --> 40:04.910
Thanks for being here.
Appreciate you.

40:04.943 --> 40:07.479
All right, ladies, the bar's
not quite finished yet,

40:07.513 --> 40:08.379
but it's close enough,
all right?

40:08.413 --> 40:11.149
So enjoy yourselves.
Thank you so much.

40:11.182 --> 40:13.685
All right.

40:13.719 --> 40:15.687
If you think I'm gonna
waive the cover charge

40:15.721 --> 40:17.656
for you, Mayor Taylor,
forget it.

40:17.689 --> 40:19.024
Nope, that's all right.
Like I said,

40:19.057 --> 40:21.760
I don't want anybody
playing favorites.

40:21.793 --> 40:23.695
Just feeds the corruption.

40:23.729 --> 40:24.863
Oh, don't mind him

40:24.896 --> 40:26.097
and don't believe him, either.

40:26.131 --> 40:28.600
There's no cover charge.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.001
Just trying to start off
on the right foot.

40:30.035 --> 40:32.037
You already have.

40:32.070 --> 40:34.105
Not a lot of people will
ever know what you did,

40:34.139 --> 40:36.708
but I do,
and I'm grateful.

40:36.742 --> 40:38.076
Well, I'm glad
things worked out.

40:38.109 --> 40:39.044
Mm-hmm.
Okay, enough chatting.

40:39.077 --> 40:40.712
It's time to party.

40:42.247 --> 40:43.849
(chuckling)

40:43.882 --> 40:45.551
All right, hey,
hurry up, get inside

40:45.584 --> 40:48.587
before the fire department
shuts us down.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.788
Who else is out here?
Hey.

40:49.821 --> 40:51.623
Hey.
You Dwayne Pride?

40:51.657 --> 40:53.592
Yes, I am.
Ooh...

40:53.625 --> 40:55.727
Bastard. You cost us
the shipyard!

40:55.761 --> 40:57.796
You cost us jobs!

40:57.829 --> 40:59.731
Come on. Come on,
man, let's go.

40:59.765 --> 41:01.800
(grunts)

41:03.969 --> 41:05.771
*

41:05.804 --> 41:08.640
* I don't smoke,
I don't shoot smack *

41:08.674 --> 41:11.810
* But I got this spicy monkey
ridin' on my back *

41:11.843 --> 41:16.281
* Don't eat beignets,
too much sugar and dough *

41:16.314 --> 41:18.717
* But I, I will play for gumbo

41:18.750 --> 41:19.818
* You know

41:19.851 --> 41:23.288
* I will play for gumbo

41:23.321 --> 41:26.191
* It started in my grandma's
in her kitchen by the sea *

41:26.224 --> 41:28.326
* Where she said
hey, little Jim *

41:28.359 --> 41:29.695
* You know
the first one's free *

41:29.728 --> 41:32.698
* Hit me like a brick

41:32.731 --> 41:33.965
* Or some Taekwondo

41:33.999 --> 41:36.134
* But I will play for gumbo

41:36.167 --> 41:39.037
* You know,
a piece of French bread *

41:39.070 --> 41:40.872
* With which to wipe
my bowl... *
Hey, King.

41:40.906 --> 41:42.073
Everything all right?

41:42.107 --> 41:43.975
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Just caught a...

41:44.009 --> 41:45.243
caught an elbow.

41:45.276 --> 41:47.145
Everybody's excited
to see Jimmy.

41:47.178 --> 41:49.314
All right. We're jammin'.

41:49.347 --> 41:52.217
* I'm not talking quesadillas

41:52.250 --> 41:54.853
* Or a dozen Krispy Kreme

41:54.886 --> 41:58.089
* Mound of caviar,
hey, that's a rich man's dream *

41:58.123 --> 42:02.227
* No banana split
or filet of pompano *

42:02.260 --> 42:04.896
* No, I will play for gumbo

42:04.930 --> 42:05.897
* You know

42:05.931 --> 42:08.066
*

42:08.099 --> 42:09.735
* Hey, Jeaux's is fine.

42:09.768 --> 42:14.272
*

42:14.305 --> 42:17.342
All right!
Give it up for Jimmy Buffett!

42:17.375 --> 42:20.746
Welcome back Pride
and the TruTone!
