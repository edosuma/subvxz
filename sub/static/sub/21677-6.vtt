00:12.879 --> 00:15.047
<i>- Previously on "Below Deck"...</i>

00:15.049 --> 00:16.265
- So you're my stewardess,
one of them.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.266
<i> - I'm your stewardess.</i>

00:17.268 --> 00:18.717
- If you had the option of

00:18.719 --> 00:20.144
making it the love boat,
who would you love?

00:20.146 --> 00:22.104
- Emily, yeah.

00:22.106 --> 00:24.606
- Yeah, it's my first time
dating a girl, actually.

00:27.393 --> 00:29.153
- I think it's wild.

00:29.155 --> 00:31.905
I'm still single.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.067
And I'm still single.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.736
- This isn't the right place
for you at this point in time.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.571
Pack your stuff
and leave the boat.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.206
- I think it'll be
smoother without him.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.407
- Better be.

00:42.409 --> 00:43.909
So this is a one-day charter.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.711
They each have two daughters
from previous marriages.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.297
<i> - "Brady Bunch."</i>
<i> - On a family retreat...</i>

00:48.299 --> 00:49.715
- Can I get another mojito,
please?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.133
- Mojito? Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

00:51.135 --> 00:52.342
- As long as they have
cocktails, they can do--

00:52.344 --> 00:53.385
they don't care.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.845
- Coors Light. Killing it!

00:54.847 --> 00:55.846
- Kyle.
- Kelley.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.389
Nice to meet you.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.807
- I've been doing
offshore supplying,

00:58.809 --> 01:00.258
working on fishing trawlers
since then.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.852
- What?
- We're not in Kansas anymore.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.520
- No.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.814
- Get started on getting
the, uh, toys in.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.232
<i> - We're already on it, Cap.</i>

01:07.234 --> 01:08.567
- Ooh.
- F---!

01:08.569 --> 01:09.735
- You all right, Kyle?
Is he all right?

01:09.737 --> 01:10.986
What happened?
- You all right?

01:10.988 --> 01:12.488
- F---ing hell.
- Oh, my God.

01:12.490 --> 01:13.697
- Holy sh--.

01:18.112 --> 01:25.167
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

01:32.593 --> 01:34.093
<i> - Oh, man.</i>

01:34.095 --> 01:35.719
- It's so good.
- Oh, it's so good.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.387
- Everything's good.
- So good.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.631
- Has anybody seen the pool?
It's gigantic.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.803
- Is he all right?
What happened?

01:44.805 --> 01:46.230
- You all right?
- F---ing hell.

01:46.232 --> 01:47.898
- Oh, my God.
- Holy sh--.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.141
Did he dislocate
his shoulder?

01:49.143 --> 01:51.401
Do you want us
to pop it back in?

01:51.403 --> 01:53.403
- Yeah, Lauren can.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.114
- It's completely come out
of the socket.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.116
To feel your muscles
and your tendons, like,

01:57.118 --> 01:59.317
move out of place,
it's so uncomfortable.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.319
And so I just have to, like,
click it back in.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.207
- You good?
- Yeah.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.708
First few times it hurts,

02:06.710 --> 02:09.253
but after it happens,
like, three, four times,

02:09.255 --> 02:10.963
yeah, you just
get on with it.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.131
Okay.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.498
- That was delicious.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.758
- Excited to go swimming?

02:14.760 --> 02:16.635
- Oh, yeah!

02:16.637 --> 02:19.304
- Hey, Kyle, hoop that
through that eyelet.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.806
We're gonna trade out lines.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.141
- They're so nice.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.809
- He seems like
a touch of class, right?

02:23.811 --> 02:25.227
- Yeah, he is.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.938
- Ooh, look at this cool--
f--- yeah.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.439
- It's time to get in the water.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.941
It's the same
as the air temperature.

02:30.943 --> 02:34.403
- That's Claire.
Claire, get in the water, bro.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.783
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.578
He's on his way.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.288
- Thank you.
- All right?

02:45.532 --> 02:48.033
All right, here we go.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.085
- Oh!

02:50.087 --> 02:52.087
- It's so windy for this now.

02:52.089 --> 02:56.133
- Yeah.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.093
- They're about to tip.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.636
- Oh!
Down! Down! Down!

02:59.638 --> 03:01.046
For f---'s sake.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.639
<i> - You guys are over the reef.</i>

03:02.641 --> 03:04.850
You all right?
- Yeah, I'll get them in, huh?

03:04.852 --> 03:07.269
I'll just keep us off the reef,
going astern.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.722
- We're gonna get you
in the boat first,

03:10.724 --> 03:13.391
get you away from this reef.
Just come to me!

03:13.393 --> 03:15.861
- There's a rock right here.
Back up. Back up. Back up.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.781
- All right.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.329
- Holy sh--!

03:26.831 --> 03:28.832
- Oh.
- Nico!

03:28.834 --> 03:30.075
- Hey.

03:30.077 --> 03:35.130
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

03:35.132 --> 03:37.382
- Everything all right,
guys?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.918
- Yeah, just a bit shaken up,
that's all.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.637
- All good?
- You okay?

03:41.639 --> 03:44.014
- Yeah.
- We're fine.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.516
- All right, one, two, three.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.562
- Are you all right?

03:50.564 --> 03:52.231
- Yeah.
- We're fine.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.691
<i> - They're in--</i>
<i> they're in the boat now.</i>

03:54.693 --> 03:56.985
- We good, girls?
- Yeah, totally.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.104
- Like, yeah,
you're all right now.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.906
We came 2 feet away
from knocking you out

04:00.908 --> 04:02.199
with the boat and killing you.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.079
- We'll put some vinegar on it.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.372
- I'm fine.

04:08.374 --> 04:10.374
- Oh, okay.

04:10.376 --> 04:12.000
- Wow, she's wounded!

04:16.089 --> 04:17.339
- I don't know.
It just happened.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.757
It was fine. It was fine.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.425
<i> - My charter guest</i>

04:20.427 --> 04:21.927
<i> It's always our fault.</i>

04:21.929 --> 04:23.595
to take care of them,

04:23.597 --> 04:25.222
make sure they have
good, safe fun.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.141
- Just breathe.
- Thanks.

Lee.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.643

04:38.645 --> 04:41.947

a solid 30 seconds.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.250

<i> don't answer their radio.</i>

04:53.252 --> 04:54.960
I'm not calling you
for my health.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.753
There's a reason
that I'm calling you.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.381
Do we have anybody on service?

04:59.383 --> 05:01.300
- Yeah, Sierra.
I'm on my break.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.218
- I can't--I can't find her.
- Kate's in her room.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.431
- No, I was busy
on the other...

05:07.433 --> 05:09.141
- They were turning,
and we're like, "Bye."

05:10.644 --> 05:12.102
- Sierra, do you have
your radio on?

05:12.104 --> 05:13.645
- I'm sorry.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.399
Whip up a batch
of Painkillers, and we'll

05:17.401 --> 05:19.151
deliver 'em to the aft deck.
- No problem.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.652
- Do you know how to do it?
- How many do we need?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.405
Yes.
- How many guests do we have?

05:23.407 --> 05:24.406
- For everyone?
- Yep.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.491
- Got it.
- Mm-kay?

05:26.493 --> 05:28.493
I mean, we're in the home
of the Painkiller.

05:28.495 --> 05:32.080
<i> It's pretty much a staple</i>
<i> here in the Virgin Islands.</i>

05:32.082 --> 05:33.999
I want to bring some levity
to the situation.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.625
- Do you need any help?
- No.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.336
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.587
- You guys almost died?
- Yeah.

05:38.589 --> 05:39.921
- The boat almost...

05:39.923 --> 05:41.298
- It was a near-death
experience.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.091
- I need a drink immediately.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.426
- Gonna put 'em
in a little container.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.378
- No, no.
Painkillers, the drink.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.513
- Oh, absolutely.
I'm so sorry.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.599
The pills...

05:50.601 --> 05:52.309
I didn't get
the Painkiller message.

05:52.311 --> 05:55.887
That's funny.

- Good.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.562

about the recipe?

06:04.564 --> 06:06.198
- Yeah, I haven't made
this many at one time.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.116
- Um, you're gonna need
more rum than this.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.235
Here, we got this, pilgrim.

something a little more calmer.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.725
- That would be nice.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.061
Then my crème brûlée
will set level.

answering their f---ing radios.

- Nope.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.525

07:29.316 --> 07:30.699
<i> - Where are ya?</i>

07:30.701 --> 07:32.617

I was in the br--restroom.

<i> - Okay, keep your radio</i>
<i> with you when you go.</i>

07:34.788 --> 07:37.122
<i> I need the aft deck cleared</i>
<i> and all the stuff,</i>

07:37.124 --> 07:38.457
all the toys put away.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.375
- Roger that.
On it now.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.660
Come on, Cap, I mean you're
up my ass and around a corner.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.045
Give me a little break here.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.218
- Headed up to wheelhouse now
and get ready to fire 'em off.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.003
- What's going on?
- We're moving

07:52.005 --> 07:53.805
'cause it's too rocky.
The captain's worried

07:53.807 --> 07:55.724
<i> about my crème brûlée</i>
<i> not setting level.</i>

07:55.726 --> 07:57.434
<i> - Did something happen</i>
<i> while I was on break?</i>

07:57.436 --> 07:58.894
- Yeah, a couple of the guests
nearly died,

07:58.896 --> 08:01.980
but nothing serious.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.398
- Nico, Lauren,
to the bow, please.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.733
<i> - Ready. </i>
- Let's do this.

08:04.735 --> 08:05.942
- Do you want to give him
direction?

08:05.944 --> 08:07.519
- Yeah.
- We're just here.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.446
Hand signals are super important
when pulling the anchor

08:09.448 --> 08:11.823
because he needs to know
exactly where the anchor's at.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.492
Right there's good.
- Huh?

08:13.494 --> 08:15.285
- We're good.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.995
It's very important
that we pull it up straight,

08:16.997 --> 08:18.830
<i> off the paint,</i>
<i> off the stainless.</i>

08:18.832 --> 08:20.415
<i> If it's leaning</i>
<i> all the way out,</i>

08:20.417 --> 08:23.335
it can hit the prop
and completely mess the boat up.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.670
A little bit that way.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.088
Yeah.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.376
- You guys look like
Moe, Larry, and Curly

08:31.378 --> 08:33.211
up there,
for crying out loud.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.547
- What's he saying?

08:35.549 --> 08:37.215
- Okay, tell him
that it's, uh--

08:37.217 --> 08:38.883
it's up and down right now.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.519
<i> - Uh, it's up and down</i>
<i> right now, Captain.</i>

08:40.521 --> 08:42.354
- My deck team right now
isn't performing

08:42.356 --> 08:44.523
up to the standards
that I expect.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.483
<i> We're four charters</i>
<i> into the season.</i>

08:46.485 --> 08:48.193
<i> And I expect their game</i>
<i> to be sharp,</i>

08:48.195 --> 08:49.945
and it's not there.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.364
<i> - Anchor's in, Cap.</i>
<i> - Roger that, thank you.</i>

08:52.366 --> 08:54.232
- Hey, we got to work
on those hand signals, girl.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.995
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

09:00.739 --> 09:01.665
- Yeah.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.961
<i> - I'm a flirty person</i>
<i> in general,</i>

09:05.963 --> 09:07.745
<i> but there's definitely</i>
<i> some sexual tension</i>

09:07.747 --> 09:09.297
between me and Emily.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.299
<i> I can tell</i>
<i> by her body language.</i>

09:14.721 --> 09:16.346
<i> - Would you like a fresh one?</i>
<i> - Yep.</i>

09:16.348 --> 09:17.847
- I'm happy to go back
to Chardonnay, though.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.591
- Okay.
- Can I get a mimosa?

09:19.593 --> 09:21.476
- I'll have the same thing.
- I'll be right back.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.596
- Sierra.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.064
Like the phonetic alphabet,
isn't it?

09:26.066 --> 09:28.233
You know, Sierra,
Tango, Whiskey.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.317
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.866
Is it spelled S-I-E-R-R-A?
- Mm-hmm.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.109
- And what's your last name?

09:38.111 --> 09:39.110
- Storm.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.945
I understand, like, 89%

09:40.947 --> 09:42.780
of what comes out
of Kyle's mouth.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.583
- Sierra Storm?
- Yes.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.751
- Well, if a lady
carries that name,

09:46.753 --> 09:48.253
there's hurricanes
coming your way.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.588
<i> - Kelley, Kelley.</i>
<i> Lee.</i>

09:49.590 --> 09:51.256
- Captain Lee,
this is Kelley.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.790
- Kelley, I need some people
up here on the bow.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.459
We need to get this anchor
dropped and set.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.094
<i> - Roger that.</i>

09:56.096 --> 09:57.429
- They're properly
sauced up now, right?

09:57.431 --> 09:58.888
- They're drinking at a rate

09:58.890 --> 10:00.432
<i> that even impresses</i>
<i> and scares me.</i>

10:00.434 --> 10:01.850
- Are they even gonna be
around for dinner?

10:01.852 --> 10:04.728
Ro is so cute.

10:04.730 --> 10:07.355
- I'm seeing a lot of texting
back and forth

10:07.357 --> 10:10.191
with this Ro character.

10:10.193 --> 10:13.311
<i> I really think she should</i>
<i> leave that on the dock</i>

10:13.313 --> 10:15.313
and deal with the job at hand.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.698
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

10:16.700 --> 10:17.782
<i> - Two shots now.</i>

10:17.784 --> 10:19.484
Two shots now.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.286
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

10:21.288 --> 10:22.704
<i> - Two shots in the water.</i>

10:22.706 --> 10:24.205
- Good job.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.749
<i> Oh, and I need</i>
<i> the waterline cleaned up</i>

10:25.751 --> 10:27.125
<i> on the boat today too.</i>

10:27.127 --> 10:28.585
<i> - Roger that.</i>
<i> On it now.</i>

10:30.130 --> 10:31.755
- Whoa.

10:31.757 --> 10:32.756
Ro's coming to visit.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.760
- F---ing boat.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.170
- I know.

10:39.172 --> 10:42.599
I'm excited for Ro to meet Ben
so he can finally understand

10:42.601 --> 10:45.810
<i> why I am so committed</i>
<i>to staying in contact with her.</i>

10:45.812 --> 10:48.063
Like, everyone loves Ro.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.565
- Is she really
6 feet tall?

10:50.567 --> 10:53.568
- She is.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.488
- Hi, what's up?
- Nothing.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.989
- Okay, so you want to hear
about ideas for

10:57.991 --> 10:59.857
the white dinner party?
- Hit me.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.743
- Theme parties are something
I really enjoy doing.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.194
It makes my job super fun,

11:03.196 --> 11:05.246
<i> and I want them</i>
<i> to be as excited</i>

11:05.248 --> 11:06.790
<i>about this white party as I am.</i>

11:06.792 --> 11:08.416
Can be like
a white rabbit party.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.126
- "Alice in Wonderland" kind of.
- Like--yep. Yep.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.586
But like all--like...
- Yeah.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.962
- We can wear little bunny ears
and little tails.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.297
- Yes, please.
Yes.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.091
- And we can make little hats.
- Okay.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.180
- You have five minutes left.
- I'm not gonna make it.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.640
This is too much.

11:23.642 --> 11:24.882
- Ah.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.772
"It will be fun."

11:35.987 --> 11:38.780
So Sierra?

11:40.825 --> 11:43.568
Huh, you're like,
"Oh, Sierra. Ugh"

11:44.830 --> 11:46.204
- Do you think
she wants it, though?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.905
- She wants something.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.708
I have no clue how long
it'll take Kyle to figure out

11:49.710 --> 11:50.875
she is nuts.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.004
Mm, we'll see
how quick he learns.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.252
- What the f---
is a wellington?

12:01.254 --> 12:03.012
- Oh, no, no.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.559
<i> - Coming up...</i>

12:07.561 --> 12:09.310
<i> - I've been looking</i>
<i> at dirty f---ing windows</i>

12:09.312 --> 12:10.687
<i> for three f---ing days.</i>
<i> - That's all inside.</i>

12:10.689 --> 12:12.856
- Do you really want
to go to war on this?

12:17.654 --> 12:19.362
- Would you like
more Chardonnay?

12:19.364 --> 12:21.439
- Oh, did I switch to liquor?

12:21.441 --> 12:22.907
- Oh, still have
the hic-em-ups?

12:22.909 --> 12:24.442
- Is that you, honey?
- Hic-em-up.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.411
- What's a "hic-em-up"?
Hic-em-ups.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.946
- Why are you calling them that?
- I always call them that.

12:28.948 --> 12:31.166
- Hic-em-ups?
- Why do you care?

12:31.168 --> 12:32.450
- You've told me this
my whole life

12:32.452 --> 12:34.419
and I've never known
about it?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.379
- Maybe you have never listened
to me until this day right now.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.422
- Okay.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.673
<i> - How are the guests?</i>

12:38.675 --> 12:39.957
- They're pretty drunk.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.593
Killing it.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.011
- I wouldn't be surprised
if they took naps.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.796
'Cause they're
on California time.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.681
<i> - They're not gonna f---ing</i>
<i> make it, are they?</i>

12:46.683 --> 12:49.017
- They're gonna make it, Ben.
We're all gonna make it.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.602
- Mm.
- Oh.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.437
Well, what time do you
want to do dinner then?

12:52.439 --> 12:53.730
- I don't know, 8:00?
- 30?

12:53.732 --> 12:55.523
- What do you think?
Should we ask them?

12:55.525 --> 12:57.025
- I really don't think
they'll notice or care.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.568
- I could sleep here.
- Yeah, I know.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.570
I could take a nap.
- You got champagne?

13:00.572 --> 13:03.198
- Yeah, for fun, dude.
We're on a f---ing boat.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.367
<i> - All right, ready?</i>
<i> - One, three, two.</i>

13:06.369 --> 13:09.954
- Oh, my God, Kelley!

13:09.956 --> 13:11.372
Oh, that was like
Red Bull and Chinese food.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.957
- You can taste that.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.250
That's proper thick,
that one, isn't it?

13:14.252 --> 13:15.493
You can put that
on a plate and eat it.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.495
- Gross.
- Hey.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.330
- Me and Kyle are
hitting it off pretty good.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.998
<i> I'm not sure about</i>
<i> Nico and Lauren,</i>

13:21.000 --> 13:22.717
<i> but they have their own</i>
<i> little, like, group.</i>

13:22.719 --> 13:24.427
And I was outside of that group.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.762
I mean to a certain extent.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.222
I am their boss, but

13:27.224 --> 13:28.890
I still like to be buddy-buddy.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.675
Do you need a medic?
- You need a medic.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.477
After that f---ing hell.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.111
You know what would be
really interesting?

13:42.113 --> 13:45.240
Is if I took an Ambien
before dinner.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.191
- Yeah.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.494
- Would be an interesting
night, though, right?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.362
- Yep.

13:51.364 --> 13:54.499
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

13:54.501 --> 13:57.836
- I'm sorry to interrupt
your texting, but, you know.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.843
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

14:06.470 --> 14:07.679
- Who? Sierra?
- Mm-hmm.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.851
- I'm not 12 years old.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.647
- Okay, that's my cue.

14:17.649 --> 14:18.890
- I'm gonna put
the groundwork in.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.725
It's like building a house.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.727
- God, Sierra, Kyle thinks
you're drop-dead gorgeous.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.696
Like, he's, like,
obsessed with you.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.031
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.200
Girl.
- Flattered.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.119
<i> In yachting, a lot of guys</i>

14:31.121 --> 14:32.570
kind of act the same.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.905
<i> They look the same.</i>

14:33.907 --> 14:35.290
- Sierra?
- Hmm?

14:35.292 --> 14:37.125
- Um, do you have any combs?
- Mm-hmm.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.668
<i> So it's refreshing</i>
<i> when you meet</i>

14:38.670 --> 14:40.411
<i> a guy that's</i>
<i> a little different,</i>

14:40.413 --> 14:42.246
a little bit more rugged.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.340
- Thank you very much, Sierra.
- Oh, you're welcome.

14:44.342 --> 14:47.418
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

14:47.420 --> 14:49.253
- There's kind of
a pause now

14:49.255 --> 14:51.139
because the guests
passed out.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.558
- Have you seen anyone dwindling
or anything like that?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.019
- No, but I think
9:00 is great.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.929
- Yeah. Uh...

14:57.931 --> 15:00.231
- In Ben's world, I should be
telling the guests

15:00.233 --> 15:01.524
what time to eat.

15:01.526 --> 15:02.734
Hi.
- That's so awesome.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.152
- Okay, can you help me
carry these?

15:04.154 --> 15:05.904
We're gonna--
- Yeah.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.196
- Yeah.

15:07.198 --> 15:09.490
In my world,
we should let them enjoy

15:09.492 --> 15:11.776
their brief, expensive vacation

15:11.778 --> 15:14.746
and be on hand
like the luxury crew

15:14.748 --> 15:16.039
we're trained to be.

15:20.420 --> 15:25.122
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

15:25.124 --> 15:27.342
- This is killer.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.129
- The what?
- Check wax, black marks.

15:32.131 --> 15:33.389
That's been done.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.682
- Black marks,
wax black marks.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.017
- Oh, sorry.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.301
- I feel like
I have to translate.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.970
I know what he's saying.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.521
- I wonder if we'll turn him
a little American

15:40.523 --> 15:41.973
and he'll turn us
a little British.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.399
- Ooh, God, I hope you
don't turn him American.

15:43.401 --> 15:44.901
Ugh, none of that.
- I'll come home

15:44.903 --> 15:46.569
back to Manchester with
stars and stripes like that.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.904
All right.
"Hey, man."

15:49.532 --> 15:51.199
- 'Sup, Cap?
- Um...

15:53.369 --> 15:55.319
Kelley's been down
this road before,

15:55.321 --> 15:57.372
so he knows what I expect.

15:57.374 --> 16:00.625
<i> He should be doing it</i>
<i> bigger, better, faster,</i>

16:00.627 --> 16:03.160
with more enthusiasm
than anybody else.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.046
- Once you finish eating,
change over.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.798
- It's still a work day,
so you're still on the clock.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.719
- What is this fancy stuff?

16:11.721 --> 16:14.597
"Claire, follow the white rabbit
to the white party.

16:14.599 --> 16:17.008
Dinner at 9:00 p.m."
Ooh.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.843
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

16:18.845 --> 16:19.936
- Good evening. How are you?
- Good.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.480
- Good.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.107
- Absolutely. Thank you.
- Perfect.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.067
Something to drink?
- Yes.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.902
- Sure.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.487
- All right.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.239
Will you pour Heidi
a Chardonnay

16:31.241 --> 16:33.658
and make him a Painkiller?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.410
- Yes.
- Ben.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.120
Do you want to come discuss
dinner with me real quick?

16:37.122 --> 16:39.080
- Dinner at 9:00.
- Mm-hmm, I heard.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.581
- In half an hour.
- Yep.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.625
- Yeah, we can have
a chat about it

16:42.627 --> 16:44.702
now that I know what's going on.
- I'm just--I'm--oh, really?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.037
- Yeah.
- You're preparing food for them

16:46.039 --> 16:47.588
at 9:00.
- Yeah, that's right.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.373
- Right, I thought that
was always the idea.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.208
- Huh?
- That was always the idea.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.262
I think 9:00 is great.
- Yeah.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.213
Kate, it's quite easy; you just
have to ask the question.

16:56.215 --> 16:57.598
- What is your problem
at this moment?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.809
- I wanted that
three hours ago, Kate.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.436
Three hours ago,
I wanted that answer.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.104
- Do you think that if...
- But instead,

17:03.106 --> 17:04.772
you didn't do anything...
- That answer--

17:04.774 --> 17:06.223
I'm not done talking.
When I went up there--

17:06.225 --> 17:07.558
- For me, that's--
you're just buying time

17:07.560 --> 17:09.610
and wasting more of my time.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.320
- That's because you're
insecure and paranoid; I'm not--

17:11.322 --> 17:13.531
- Insecure? No, I just want
direction with my job...

17:13.533 --> 17:14.732
- Okay.
- If that's okay.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.284
- I don't want to hear it.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.327
- I don't have time
to be texting my girlfriend

17:18.329 --> 17:20.204
all day, okay?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.498
I don't have time
to go and have a nap

17:22.500 --> 17:24.000
or send the others
to have a nap.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.002
I don't have
two minions under me

17:26.004 --> 17:27.712
doing everything
I don't want to do.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.840
I don't have these luxuries.

17:33.845 --> 17:37.513

17:37.515 --> 17:38.848

17:41.226 --> 17:43.561

17:49.360 --> 17:51.694
- Hi, girls, you look adorable.
- I love it.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.237
- Ben, so you're
pretty much ready, right?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.490
- Kate, give me a damn break.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.824
- Whatever.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.035

17:59.037 --> 18:01.204
- Oh, that looks fabulous.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.164
- Wow!
- Wow.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.417
- Beautiful.
Everything's great.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.255
- The guests
are at the table, Ben.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.715
- You're trying to rush me

18:12.717 --> 18:14.258
and freak me out.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.344
- Isn't it so fun?

18:18.097 --> 18:20.014
- Totally, I agree.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.966
- It isn't.
- It's never too late.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.935
<i> - When I'm in times of stress,</i>

18:23.937 --> 18:27.105
having these slapstick
sound bites in my ear...

18:29.109 --> 18:30.733
<i> - Is not really helping me.</i>

18:30.735 --> 18:32.360
It's f---ing annoying.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.862
- Emily, will you follow me
with the salmon tartare?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.280
- Uh, tuna.
- Tuna, sorry.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.815
- Hey, you need to take
the rice first.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.535
Also, the--the sabut
needs to go first, as well.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.411
I mean, come on.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.705
Who the hell's going out--
no, no, put it on the tray.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.083
- To start, we have
jalapeño salmon...

18:47.085 --> 18:48.751
- Oh, man.
- And tuna tartare.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.419
- Thank you.
- That rice is huge.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.296
- Holy sh--.
- There's rice for days.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.631
- Beautiful.
- Oh.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.133
- It's hella good.
- Oh, man.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.593
- Seared duck breast
with soy pearls.

18:57.595 --> 18:58.886
- It's so good! It's so good.
- So good.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.263
- It's really good.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.098
-<i> Service, s'il vous plaît.</i>

19:02.100 --> 19:03.891
- Here we have
sashimi of scallop...

19:03.893 --> 19:06.561
- Wow.
- With trout roe and jalapeño.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.229
- When did you make
all this food, Ben?

19:08.231 --> 19:09.939
- I don't know.
I guess I've been blacked out

19:09.941 --> 19:11.849
for the last three hours.

19:11.851 --> 19:15.319
- We'll do, um--we can make
some simple syrup real quick.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.188
Stop it.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.990
Ben, I'm cleared
- Okay.

19:18.992 --> 19:23.194
So vanilla crème brûlée,
chocolate cigar, whipped cream.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.997
F---.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.082
- This is the best thing
ever in my life.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.034
- Yes.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.589
- Oh, she's texting
every minute.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.008
That's not a distraction
at all.

19:37.010 --> 19:41.045
Now.
Three minutes ago.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.431
I don't know about this
Ro character.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.266
<i> - Coming up...</i>

19:45.268 --> 19:47.101
- What the hell was that about?
Why wouldn't you be like,

19:47.103 --> 19:48.436
"Well, there's a chance that--
because Lauren has no

19:48.438 --> 19:50.104
experience..."
- Because she wants--

19:50.106 --> 19:51.722
he wanted to see it.
- You can't have my back.

19:51.724 --> 19:52.815
- Don't tell me
I don't have your back.

19:59.032 --> 20:02.533
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

20:02.535 --> 20:04.493
- Hey, we just need to,
around Captain,

20:04.495 --> 20:06.287
just make sure
we're staying busy.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.539
Stay out of the crew mess.
He's on us for some reason.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.792
I think he's just
a little bored at the moment.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.410
- That was delicious.
- Kids, go in the hot tub.

20:13.412 --> 20:14.879
- Yeah.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.047
- Y'all two, go down.
- Thanks, man.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.081
Appreciate that.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.582
- We need bathing suits.

20:18.584 --> 20:22.803
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

20:24.973 --> 20:27.892
- Yes.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.645
- Kelley embraces the
opportunity to be topless.

20:30.647 --> 20:33.606
It--it's not something that
excites me, to be honest.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.817
- You too.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.569
- I mean, they have to pass out
at some point, right?

20:38.571 --> 20:39.987
- Right? Yeah.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.739
- If they order
any more Irish coffees,

20:41.741 --> 20:43.658
use the red decaf.
- I have been.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.276
- Let's--do not give them
more caffeine.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.745
- I wish I had some Baileys
and coffee.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.082
Like, that's way better, ooh.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.416
- That's it.
Thank you for a good night.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.784
- Okay. Yeah. Thank you.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.920
- We're going to bed.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.713
- Hi.
<i> - Hi.</i>

20:57.715 --> 20:59.257
- How are you?

20:59.259 --> 21:01.050
- Yep.

21:01.052 --> 21:03.427
In the past, I didn't ever
contact the people I was dating

21:03.429 --> 21:05.346
because I wasn't actually
that into them.

21:05.348 --> 21:08.465
<i>So I warned Ro that I might not</i>
<i> have time to chat with her,</i>

21:08.467 --> 21:10.634
<i> but now I feel</i>
<i> like I can make time.</i>

21:10.636 --> 21:13.020
And I've never made time
for anybody before on land.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.110
- Brenden.
- Brenden.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.736
- Brennen.
- Brennen.

21:22.864 --> 21:23.906
- "Was"?

21:26.618 --> 21:28.869
- Oh, that's too bad.

21:28.871 --> 21:29.912
- Oh.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.658
- Who's not upset?

21:37.713 --> 21:39.130
- I'm just trying
to be supportive.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.715
I'm actually really pissed.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.634
- Mm-kay, bye.

21:43.636 --> 21:44.885
- I don't know which one's mine.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.470
- This one.
- Okay.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.173

22:04.824 --> 22:07.450
- Wow.

22:07.452 --> 22:10.911
Look how salty everything is.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.581
- Mmm. Yeah.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.699
- I've had one person up
since I've been up.

22:15.701 --> 22:17.501
I've been looking
at dirty f---ing windows

22:17.503 --> 22:19.703
for three f---ing days.

22:19.705 --> 22:22.256
I'll go chew on somebody's ass.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.348

22:30.350 --> 22:31.599
- No.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.184
- What?

22:33.186 --> 22:36.387
- I thought it was a new box,
and it's not.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.105
<i> - Emily's got amazing energy.</i>

22:38.107 --> 22:40.724
I enjoy her English company.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.059
Don't worry about it.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.560
<i> - Kelley, Kelley.</i>
<i> Lee.</i>

22:43.562 --> 22:45.029
<i> - For Kelley. </i>
- Yeah, can I see you

22:45.031 --> 22:46.697
in the bridge for a second?

22:46.699 --> 22:48.282
- Coming up now.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.784
<i> - If Kelley doesn't</i>
<i> start performing</i>

22:49.786 --> 22:51.452
<i> the way I think he should,</i>

22:51.454 --> 22:53.996
I'll probably just end up
having to babysit him

22:53.998 --> 22:56.540
all the way through the season.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.908
- 'Sup, Cap?

22:57.910 --> 22:59.543
- You and I both look out
the same windows,

22:59.545 --> 23:01.670
and we see the same dirt.

23:01.672 --> 23:04.673
And I'm wondering how come
nobody's taken care of it.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.750
Lauren's been up since 6:30

23:06.752 --> 23:08.803
and yet hasn't
touched anything.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.346
- Um...

23:10.348 --> 23:12.640
I want to show you this.
- Okay.

23:12.642 --> 23:15.684
- That's all inside.
- Okay.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.396
- That's--that's a Kate issue.
- But it's--it's still there.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.064
- We're not inside.
That's interior, Captain.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.433
- I didn't--
Well, okay. Fine.

23:22.435 --> 23:25.102
Go downstairs and tell me that
salt is on the f---ing inside.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.695
- No, that--that's--okay.
- That's right.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.823
And it's been there
for two f---ing days.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.825
- I feel like we get called out
on a lot of things,

23:30.827 --> 23:32.493
and you don't always
call Kate out on it.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.778
- Do you really want
to go to war on this?

23:34.780 --> 23:36.038
- I don't. I was just--

23:36.040 --> 23:37.281
- We can.
I got no issues with it.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.749
- No, I was just
trying to point out,

23:38.751 --> 23:40.084
it seems like we're
getting picked on...

23:40.086 --> 23:41.836
- You think there's
a double standard?

23:41.838 --> 23:43.671
You're getting picked on?
Come here, let's go look at it.

23:43.673 --> 23:44.922
- No, I believe you, Cap.
- No, come.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.623
- Okay.
- Let's go.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.259
In Kelley's situation,
he's given a second shot

23:48.261 --> 23:50.344
at redemption;
he should be stepping forward,

23:50.346 --> 23:52.763
front and center and going,
"Sorry about that, Cap.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.015
<i> I'll get on it.</i>
<i> Won't happen again."</i>

23:55.017 --> 23:56.767
Not this wallowing in self-pity.

23:56.769 --> 24:00.137
Two days, it's been like that.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.231
Just to show you that
it's not on the inside.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.566
- Okay.
- Are we clear?

24:03.568 --> 24:04.900
- Yep, we're clear.
- Good.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.735
I want it done.
- Roger that.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.904
- So what is your person
that's been up been doing?

24:08.906 --> 24:10.814
- I'll deal with it.

24:10.816 --> 24:12.816
He won't pick on Kate.
He won't mess with the stews.

24:12.818 --> 24:15.578
<i> He's terrified of Kate, and</i>
<i> it makes my job more difficult</i>

24:15.580 --> 24:17.154
because then he just
comes after me.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.156
- Drop off day.
- Drop off day.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.250
- Dude, let's smash it out.
Let's try to be done, by, like--

24:22.920 --> 24:24.628
- Hey, guys, before we get
underway, let's go ahead

24:24.630 --> 24:25.796
<i> and hit the windows once</i>
<i> all the way around.</i>

24:25.798 --> 24:27.331

- Windows.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.133
- Copy that, Kell.
- All the windows.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.384
- All the windows.

24:30.386 --> 24:33.304
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

24:33.306 --> 24:35.473
<i> - Go double-check</i>
<i> those windows down there.</i>

24:35.475 --> 24:37.308
- Can't go out
without sunglasses.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.894
- Sorry. Spray in your face.
- No, no, that's all right.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.646
Been sprayed in the face before.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.517
- Morning. Hello.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.652
- Coffee.
May as well get two of 'em.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.154
- How was the rest
of last night?

24:50.156 --> 24:51.522
- It was really fun.
- Good.

24:51.524 --> 24:52.990
- Good?
- Yeah.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.358
- Should we go ahead
with breakfast now,

24:54.360 --> 24:55.743
or do you want
to wait till 10:00?

24:55.745 --> 24:57.328
I've really got
to give it to them.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.079
If I had drunk the quantity
that they had yesterday,

24:59.081 --> 25:01.665
then I don't think I'd be seeing
the light of day

25:01.667 --> 25:02.958
for a good few days.

25:05.703 --> 25:06.962
- All guests up.

25:06.964 --> 25:10.174
- Still warm.
Cool.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.259
- A piece of bacon?

25:12.261 --> 25:13.710
- Would you like some
blueberry pancakes?

25:13.712 --> 25:15.262
- Sure.
- Are they happy?

25:15.264 --> 25:18.057
- They are.
They seem very content.

25:20.385 --> 25:21.685
- Not much.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.689
- Um, good.
Oh, how am I doing my hair?

25:25.691 --> 25:27.525
- Yeah, yeah, 'cause if we
get married, I need to know.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.026
- Oh.
- I need to know these things.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.727
- It's probably gonna
change every day.

25:30.729 --> 25:33.030
- Okay, fine.
I see--I see how it goes.

25:33.032 --> 25:36.200
- I want Lauren running
the point on anchor today

25:36.202 --> 25:38.369
and you and Nico up here.

25:38.371 --> 25:39.903
I'm trying to get you
to look at things

25:39.905 --> 25:42.039
differently than
you ever had before.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.574
Because now you are
a department head,

25:43.576 --> 25:45.626
you are in a position
where you have authority.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.879
I just want you to get an idea

25:48.881 --> 25:51.081
of my frustration.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.552
Kelley's deck crew isn't
living up to expectations.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.345
<i> So I want him</i>
<i> to take notice of that.</i>

25:56.347 --> 25:58.222
I want him to see what I see.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.923
- Uh, you're gonna be doing
the anchor today.

25:59.925 --> 26:01.559
You're just gonna pull it up
on your own.

26:01.561 --> 26:04.812
- All right.
- Knock it out of the park.

26:04.814 --> 26:07.231
- Engage steering.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.932
<i> - It's a bit stressful that</i>

26:08.934 --> 26:10.651
I haven't done it
by myself before.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.152
Every time we do the anchor,

26:12.154 --> 26:13.737
<i> there's always</i>
<i> two people doing it.</i>

26:13.739 --> 26:15.197
- Okay, Lauren, let's
get us out of here.

26:15.199 --> 26:16.532
<i> - Copy that.</i>
<i> Lifting up now.</i>

26:16.534 --> 26:18.108
<i> But for some reason,</i>

26:18.110 --> 26:19.743
<i> I've been called</i>
<i> to come up by myself.</i>

26:19.745 --> 26:22.746
It just doesn't make sense
at all.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.449
- I'm not sure what the
little finger wiggles are.

26:25.451 --> 26:28.252
Maybe she just likes the breeze.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.953
And I don't know
what that means.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.424
<i> - Anchor's off the bottom.</i>

26:33.426 --> 26:34.883
- We had three shots out.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.260
<i> Anchor should not be</i>
<i> off the bottom.</i>

26:36.262 --> 26:37.720
- All right.

26:37.722 --> 26:40.097
- She has no clue
where her hand is.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.765
<i> - It's hard for me to watch</i>

26:41.767 --> 26:43.934
<i> because she's getting</i>
<i> everything wrong.</i>

26:43.936 --> 26:47.304
I want to just run down there
and just tell her to, like,

26:47.306 --> 26:50.608
do this and do that,
and he's not having it.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.443
<i> - Anchor's now</i>
<i> off the bottom, Cap.</i>

26:52.445 --> 26:54.612
- Are we sure about that
this time?

26:57.149 --> 26:58.949
<i> - Anchor's home and secured.</i>

26:58.951 --> 27:00.367
<i> - Just a learning experience.</i>

27:00.369 --> 27:03.820
And then maybe next time
on the next charter,

27:03.822 --> 27:05.956
I'll get her and them up here.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.791
And then you guys
can go out there and

27:07.793 --> 27:10.127
do it all wrong

27:10.129 --> 27:12.630
so that she can get an idea
of exactly what

27:12.632 --> 27:14.048
<i> she's been doing.</i>

27:14.050 --> 27:15.799
Oy, oy, oy.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.669
I'm really pissed off.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.763
<i> Such f---ing bullsh--.</i>

27:20.765 --> 27:23.265
I was just completely
thrown under the bus.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.975
What the hell was that about?

27:24.977 --> 27:27.144
- Captain called us in the
bridge, he wanted us to watch.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.646
- There's always been
two people there.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.481
Yes, Captain now
wants one person.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.182
Regardless, I have
no experience up there.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.984
Why wouldn't you be like,
"Well, there's a chance that

27:33.986 --> 27:35.778
because Lauren has no experience
that she might screw it up"?

27:35.780 --> 27:37.655
- Because she wants--
he wanted to see it.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.323
<i> Once he makes up his mind,</i>
<i> I can't really change it.</i>

27:39.325 --> 27:41.659
- You can't have my back?
You can't be like--

27:41.661 --> 27:43.494
- Don't tell me I don't have
your back because I just got

27:43.496 --> 27:45.996
into it this morning with him
yelling in my face about you.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.125
<i> - Coming up...</i>

27:50.127 --> 27:52.086
- Who the f--- is that?
What?

27:52.088 --> 27:54.004
Shut up.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.422
- Oh, my God!

28:01.013 --> 28:02.805
- You can't have my back?
You can't be like--

28:02.807 --> 28:04.682
- Don't tell me I don't have
your back because I just got

28:04.684 --> 28:08.385
into it this morning with him
yelling in my face about you.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.354
- What have I done now?
Why is Captain pissed at me?

28:10.356 --> 28:12.147
- Nothing, he said you weren't
doing anything this morning.

28:12.149 --> 28:14.441
And I fought back on it.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.193
I haven't let
sh-- roll downhill.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.729
I've kept y'all happy
and enjoying your time

28:18.731 --> 28:20.230
while I've been
taking all the sh--.

28:20.232 --> 28:23.158
I have your back.
I have it no matter what.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.035
And you walk away.
Dude, the thing is, is like--

28:25.037 --> 28:26.570
- I'm just really upset
right now.

28:26.572 --> 28:27.996
- No, I show you respect--
yeah, you're upset

28:27.998 --> 28:29.289
and I'm telling you not to be.

28:29.291 --> 28:30.708
I have f---ed up
with the Captain

28:30.710 --> 28:32.042
so many times on this thing.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.910
Do not let it get to you.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.879
I'm telling you right now.
Come here.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.131
F---ing come here.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.718
It's okay.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.586
It's not worth it.

28:42.588 --> 28:45.139
- Captain seems to be
really on Kelley's ass,

28:45.141 --> 28:47.641
and Kelley's on our ass, but
we're all still working hard.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.226
We're all getting the job done,

28:49.228 --> 28:51.094
so I don't know
why he's being difficult.

28:53.149 --> 28:55.858
- It's gonna okay,
all right?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.770
- I feel like
Jay Z and Beyoncé.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.238
I'm Beyoncé.
- I'm Jay Z.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.907
Oh, my gosh.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.610
- He's Blue Ivy.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.495
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

29:08.497 --> 29:10.447
<i> - He's the one who</i>
<i> jumped in the water, right?</i>

29:10.449 --> 29:11.999
<i> And rescued us?</i>
<i> - Nico?</i>

29:12.001 --> 29:14.835
- Uh-huh, 'cause we
almost got straight murked.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.922
- I'm barely gonna have
enough room to swing.

29:18.924 --> 29:21.091
- Nice, how you looking
on the stern?

29:21.093 --> 29:23.093
<i> - Yeah, we're looking good.</i>
<i> Uh, we're pulling tight on it.</i>

29:23.095 --> 29:25.053
Put the eyelet way up there.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.889
- We can shut 'em down.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.632
- That went a bit smoother
than I thought it would go.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.684
- Sh--.
- What?

29:34.273 --> 29:35.806
- Did he?
- Yeah.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.775
- Can we take that, sir?
I'm staying out of it.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.777
All right?
- Yeah.

29:39.779 --> 29:42.738
- All crew, all crew,
I need everybody on the aft deck

29:42.740 --> 29:45.315
<i> in your dress clothes in ten.</i>

29:45.317 --> 29:47.951
- How did this fit in here
when I packed it originally?

29:47.953 --> 29:49.486
- Is it too late for a mimosa?

29:49.488 --> 29:50.821
<i> Or too early for a cocktail?</i>

29:52.291 --> 29:55.158
- Ready, set, go.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.993
- Safe travels. Thank you guys.
- Nice to meet you guys.

29:56.995 --> 29:58.462
- Safe travels.
- Hope you had a great trip.

29:58.464 --> 29:59.797
- Nice meeting you.
- Bye-bye.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.256
- Bye. Nice meeting you.
- Enjoyed it, sir.

30:01.258 --> 30:03.500
- Bye. You guys were lovely.
- Thank you.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.502
- Well, we had a great time.
- Hope you did, Marc.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.970
- Everything was fabulous.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.431
Nico, thank you
for showing your true valor

30:09.433 --> 30:10.674
and saving the girls.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.177
They call me Valorman.

30:14.179 --> 30:15.771
F--- Superman.

30:15.773 --> 30:17.397
- We had a wonderful time.
- Thank you so much.

30:17.399 --> 30:18.440
Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

30:18.442 --> 30:19.683
Bye.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.151
- Okay.
We got a boat to flip.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.688
Attention all crew,
I need everybody

30:24.690 --> 30:28.450
in the crew mess directly.

30:28.452 --> 30:31.078
Number four,
in the books.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.579
Nico, you did a nice job
with the girls.

30:32.581 --> 30:33.914
- Thank you.

30:33.916 --> 30:35.249
- You did the right thing
jumping in.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.033
Kyle, take your hat off.
You're inside.

30:37.035 --> 30:38.418
- Sorry, sir.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.087
- It was good
having you on board.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.673
It made a big difference
on the deck, I'm sure.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.676
We had some hiccups.

30:45.678 --> 30:48.262
Radios still are
a pet peeve of mine.

30:48.264 --> 30:50.046
I don't care what you're doing.

30:50.048 --> 30:54.351
Everybody better have
their frigging radio with them.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.104
That just really
wrinkles my ass to no end.

30:57.106 --> 30:59.815
Really don't want to keep
going over that again.

30:59.817 --> 31:04.194
So we got 15 grand.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.445
- Ha-ha.

31:05.447 --> 31:09.566
- Comes out to $1,350 apiece.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.234
- Thank you, sir.

31:11.236 --> 31:13.203
- Thank you.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.038
- Kate.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.908
- This one-day charter was like
a really good one-night stand.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.910
<i> Sure, it started</i>
<i> with some bumps and bruises,</i>

31:19.912 --> 31:22.963
but in the end,
there was a really big tip.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.715
- Oh, I had a surprise.

31:24.717 --> 31:27.301
It's one of those
"good news, bad news" things.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.252
- Bad news first.

31:29.254 --> 31:30.888
- The slide's here.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.306
- Yay.
- Oh.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.925
- And it will be on board
for the next charter.

31:34.927 --> 31:37.227
Uh, the good news is,

31:37.229 --> 31:38.929
I called up a friend of mine,

31:38.931 --> 31:41.648
while we're at Scrub Island
and arranged for you guys

31:41.650 --> 31:42.900
to have a resort
to yourselves tomorrow.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.026
- Oh.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.528
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

31:46.530 --> 31:47.938
<i> Thank you, God.</i>

31:47.940 --> 31:49.606
<i> Let's just not</i>
<i> think about work,</i>

31:49.608 --> 31:52.034
not think about any drama
going on with the boat.

31:52.036 --> 31:54.745
Let's just have a nice day
and enjoy ourselves.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.330
- Please honor my wishes
this evening.

31:56.332 --> 31:58.874
Do not go off the boat,
okay?

31:58.876 --> 32:00.751
Tomorrow, if you want
to crawl in a bottle of rum,

32:00.753 --> 32:02.419
I don't care.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.287
But the next day after that,
we're working hard.

32:04.289 --> 32:06.456
- Roger that.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.884
<i> - We're doing a wash-down,</i>
<i> getting all the dirt off,</i>

32:08.886 --> 32:10.385
<i> all the salt off,</i>
<i> just double-check 'em all,</i>

32:10.387 --> 32:11.720
<i> make sure they're perfect.</i>

32:14.725 --> 32:17.968
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

32:17.970 --> 32:19.853
- So we don't work
at all tomorrow?

32:19.855 --> 32:21.104
- Yeah!

32:21.106 --> 32:25.901
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

32:30.449 --> 32:37.496
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

32:41.292 --> 32:43.210
- Oh!

32:45.923 --> 32:47.831
Oh!

32:47.833 --> 32:49.257
- Work those tris.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.500
- This is the
"I don't know" rep.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.052
"Do I know?
I don't know."

32:53.973 --> 32:55.263
- All right, kids, let's go.

32:58.268 --> 33:00.510
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

33:00.512 --> 33:02.646
<i> - How are you doing, baby?</i>

33:02.648 --> 33:04.439
You get a nice sleep?

33:04.441 --> 33:06.149
- Yeah, I took an Ambien,
and in the middle of the night

33:06.151 --> 33:07.517
I walked out, got a Diet Coke
and a can of Pringles.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.111
- Whew.

33:09.113 --> 33:10.779
- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm going on the dock.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.116
- Who the f--- is that?

33:14.118 --> 33:17.077
What?
Shut up.

33:17.079 --> 33:18.695
- Hi.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.665
- I think Ambien should be
more of a daytime drug.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.367
Like, recreational.
- I have it in my purse.

33:24.369 --> 33:25.627
<i>- Hey, guys.</i>
<i>Where's Kate?</i>

33:25.629 --> 33:27.504
- Um...
- Oh, my God, it's you.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.339
- Where is she?
- I was gonna say...

33:29.341 --> 33:31.508
- Hey. How's it going?
- "I've seen you before."

33:31.510 --> 33:33.510
- This is Nico; he's
super cool; he's super young.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.378
- Don't worry.
I'm only 22, so...

33:35.380 --> 33:39.850
She's super attractive, Spanish.
That's hot, like...

33:39.852 --> 33:41.518
<i> Professional football player.</i>

33:41.520 --> 33:43.645
She--like--
why are you a lesbian?

33:43.647 --> 33:45.221
Hey, Kate!
- Yeah?

33:45.223 --> 33:46.523
- Come here for a second.

33:46.525 --> 33:47.941
I got to talk to you
about something.

33:47.943 --> 33:49.359
- What?
- It's really important.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.394
- What?
Oh, my God!

33:51.396 --> 33:52.654
- Surprise!

33:52.656 --> 33:54.281
- Oh, my God!

33:54.283 --> 33:56.566
I knew you were lying.
You're so full of sh--.

33:56.568 --> 33:57.993
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

33:57.995 --> 33:59.870
- Hi.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.121
Hi, baby.
- Hi.

34:03.167 --> 34:06.209
I've never been this close
to a panic attack

34:06.211 --> 34:07.961
in my life.

34:07.963 --> 34:10.130
<i> I'm happy,</i>
<i> but I'm also freaking out</i>

34:10.132 --> 34:12.749
because I would have liked
to spent more time with my hair.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.177
I'm getting out.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.636
I don't want to get out.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.139
Like, you can--
you can--you can keep--

34:19.141 --> 34:20.724
<i> Are you guys coming?</i>
<i> No?</i>

34:20.726 --> 34:22.392
No?
Okay?

34:22.394 --> 34:25.228
- Oh.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.596
<i> Coming up...</i>

34:28.233 --> 34:30.100
- Oh, my God, Ben is, like,
hating his life right now.

34:30.102 --> 34:32.936
- You want a martini?
- Cosmo.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.362
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:34.364 --> 34:35.822
Very strong.

34:42.331 --> 34:44.948
- Whoa.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.541
Ben.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.001
- Did you just see
who walked on board?

34:48.003 --> 34:49.544
- I did.

34:49.546 --> 34:51.880
- Ro knows that Kate and I
have had a history.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.883
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:54.885 --> 34:56.510
<i> - Yeah, I'm obviously</i>
<i> a little bit nervous,</i>

34:56.512 --> 34:58.128
<i> but that's natural, right?</i>

34:58.130 --> 34:59.387
You'd be weird if you weren't

34:59.389 --> 35:00.797
gonna be a tiny bit nervous.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.349
- So you want to see
the rest of the boat?

35:02.351 --> 35:03.391
- Oh, yeah.

35:05.395 --> 35:08.772
- I'm not usually a person
who does a lot of PDA.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.107
The master bathroom.

35:10.109 --> 35:11.441
But...

35:11.443 --> 35:12.901
- Disappointing.
- It's super light.

35:13.946 --> 35:16.279
- I just can't help it.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.614
And I don't really care.

35:22.154 --> 35:24.121
- She's, like,
super f---ing fine.

35:24.123 --> 35:26.322
<i> - Yeah, she was pretty hot.</i>
<i> - I'd be a lesbian too.</i>

35:26.324 --> 35:27.824
- If I was a lesbian,
I'd do her.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.292
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.420
- Uh-huh.
That's the master bathroom.

35:32.422 --> 35:35.215
- Uhh, would I be
wasting time with Emily?

35:35.217 --> 35:36.800
<i> - I don't think you're</i>
<i> her type, per se.</i>

35:36.802 --> 35:38.802
I think you're just, like,
too, like, older,

35:38.804 --> 35:40.554
more, like, macho
than she's used to.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.056
<i> I mean, I would give it a go.</i>

35:43.058 --> 35:44.224
- Do some more reconnaissance

35:44.226 --> 35:45.809
for me, a little bit.

35:45.811 --> 35:46.893
<i> I haven't been pushing</i>

35:46.895 --> 35:48.103
- Yeah.

35:48.105 --> 35:49.179
- Should we wait inside
for them?

35:49.181 --> 35:50.438
- Yeah.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.566
- This is Ben's area.
- Yeah.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.017
<i> - I can't wait to meet Ben.</i>

35:54.019 --> 35:55.402

this is Ro.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.612
- Hi, Ro.

35:57.614 --> 35:59.239
- I'm Ben.
- What's up, Ben?

35:59.241 --> 36:00.690
- How's it going?
- Very nice to meet you all.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.192
- I didn't expect you
to be so tall.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.451
- Hey, I'm Lauren.
nice to meet you.

36:03.453 --> 36:04.786
- I am super tall.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.696
<i> - Ro is in the Caribbean.</i>

36:06.698 --> 36:10.000
And she's wearing dark
on dark on dark.

36:10.002 --> 36:11.585
Looks like she
just crawled out

36:11.587 --> 36:14.004
of a fallout shelter in Moscow.

36:14.006 --> 36:15.422
Yeah.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.007
- I miss you.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.008
- Good morning.

36:20.262 --> 36:21.761

36:35.652 --> 36:37.360

- A lot.

- Surprise.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.506
Oh, my God.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.806
- I was just like...

37:09.518 --> 37:11.853
- With any one of the guys,
that'd be true,

37:11.855 --> 37:13.688
if they just came up to me...
- And asked you on a date?

37:13.690 --> 37:15.523
- And asked me out, I'd say...
- You'd probably go.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.901
- I would go--but...
- Yeah.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.035

Look at that water.

crew bonding day together.

37:30.115 --> 37:31.414
- So this is Scrub Island?

37:31.416 --> 37:32.832
- Most of us
got into this industry

37:32.834 --> 37:34.709

and see new places, so...

37:34.711 --> 37:36.619

37:36.621 --> 37:38.338

in the water?

37:40.008 --> 37:42.008
That's pretty epic.

"Oh, I'm gonna protect you.
I'll be your man. It's okay."

38:08.987 --> 38:10.578
- You know Deborah's style,
right?

38:10.580 --> 38:13.081
- Yeah, Deborah.
- Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.916
What's up, Ben?

38:14.918 --> 38:16.993

38:16.995 --> 38:18.712

38:18.714 --> 38:21.798

the boat at night.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.469
- Yeah.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.856
I didn't have a clue
about her sexuality.

- Dangerous.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.206
- Can you get my back?

39:36.208 --> 39:38.875
I try to play shy like,
"No, really, no."

39:38.877 --> 39:42.003
And, uh, yeah,
I'll eat it up all day long.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.547
This is like a proper massage
while I get sunscreen.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.972
Kelley.

39:52.974 --> 39:55.058
Kelley's definitely flirting,
in his way, with me.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.019
He's very sweet, but I'm finding
it slightly too touchy-feely.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.932

40:02.934 --> 40:05.110
- Now that I've screwed up

step up his game.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.368

40:13.370 --> 40:15.370

to spice things up.

40:15.372 --> 40:16.746
Sorry.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.614
- It's all small signals,

<i> how you look at 'em,</i>
<i> how you smile at 'em.</i>

40:20.285 --> 40:21.876

Ready?

40:47.946 --> 40:50.029
Let's go.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.948
- Like, I have a lot
of respect for fishermen.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.284
Jesus was a fisherman.
- Jesus was a carpenter.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.619
- I know he was a carpenter,
but he taught a man to fish.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.037
- He didn't teach
a man to fish at all.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.706
- He did.
- No, he fed the 5,000.

40:59.708 --> 41:02.709
- Well, I mean,
he turned loaves into fish.

41:02.711 --> 41:04.961
- No, he turned the fish
into multiple amounts of fish.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.629
- Okay, Catholic school,
like eight years.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.423
- Yeah, yeah,
I'm Catholic as well.

41:08.425 --> 41:10.467
And you're f---ing wrong.
He made the bread, more...

41:10.469 --> 41:12.385
- I said loaves into fish.

41:12.387 --> 41:14.137
- No, he didn't turn
the loaves into fish.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.139
Turned the loaves into
more bread and he turned...

41:16.141 --> 41:17.765
- Yeah.
- The fish into more fish.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.767
Sierra, as a person,
she's f---ing out there.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.562
Absolute loopy. Fruit loop.
A bit mental.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.439
- That's cool.
You're Catholic; I'm Catholic.

41:24.441 --> 41:25.815
- Are we?
- Uh-huh.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.567
- So practically,
we're married.

41:27.569 --> 41:29.319
I understand that I could end up
with a knife in my chest.

41:29.321 --> 41:31.521
You do realize, though,
that I find you very attractive?

41:31.523 --> 41:35.024
You're stunning.
Absolutely beautiful.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.412
- Think I'm cool?

41:39.414 --> 41:40.788
- So what's that?
It's like, okay,

41:40.790 --> 41:43.291
you're cool, but--

41:43.293 --> 41:45.168
You're nice.
