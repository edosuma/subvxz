00:00.931 --> 00:04.065
Miss Leslie Knope,
I present to you Herb Scaifer.

00:04.083 --> 00:05.783
Again, Andy,
you don't need to bow.

00:05.834 --> 00:06.868
As you wish, ma'am.

00:06.902 --> 00:08.336
Okay, Herb,
what can I do you for?

00:08.371 --> 00:11.756
Well, please prepare yourself.
I have terrible news.

00:11.790 --> 00:12.641
You do?

00:12.675 --> 00:15.210
The world is going
to end tomorrow at dawn.

00:15.244 --> 00:17.795
Aw nuts.
You sure it's tomorrow?

00:17.846 --> 00:20.715
Afraid so.
Right at dawn.

00:20.749 --> 00:24.519
Zorp is going to be here
to free you from your flesh.

00:25.553 --> 00:27.354
For a while in the 1970s,

00:27.355 --> 00:31.254
our town was run by a freaky cult.
And every few years

00:31.255 --> 00:33.754
the remaining members predicted
the world's gonna end.

00:33.755 --> 00:35.723
And they have an all-night
vigil in the park.

00:36.257 --> 00:37.858
It's super annoying.

00:37.893 --> 00:39.894
Turns out when you think
the world's ending,

00:39.928 --> 00:43.097
you don't aim so carefully
in the port-a-potties.

00:46.134 --> 00:47.734

00:48.134 --> 00:57.734
<font color="#ff8c00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:03.268 --> 01:06.420
Why does the cult call
themselves "The Reasonableists"?

01:06.455 --> 01:08.756
Well, they figure if
people criticize them

01:08.790 --> 01:09.857
it'll seem like they're

01:09.891 --> 01:11.192
attacking something
very reasonable.

01:11.226 --> 01:12.793
That's weirdly brilliant.

01:12.828 --> 01:14.228
Look, there's nothing
to worry about.

01:14.262 --> 01:16.297
They've said that the world
is going to end 15 times.

01:16.331 --> 01:17.648
And the only bad thing
that's ever happened

01:17.699 --> 01:19.233
on any of those dates is

01:19.267 --> 01:22.136
Lance Armstrong
dumping Sheryl Crow.

01:22.170 --> 01:23.955
- That was a tragic day.
- Hmm.

01:23.989 --> 01:25.840
Live strong.

01:25.874 --> 01:29.126
In any rate, I think Ben and I
should accompany you tonight.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.745
Oh, I don't think
we have to do that.

01:30.779 --> 01:32.279
No, no, no, I insist.

01:32.297 --> 01:35.149
These people
live on planet nutbrain.

01:35.183 --> 01:37.885
I live on planet nut bran.

01:37.919 --> 01:39.670
Bran and nuts are very
helpful for your colon!

01:39.721 --> 01:40.671
Well, it looks like
we're kind of forced

01:40.722 --> 01:42.289
to hang out with each other.

01:42.307 --> 01:44.175
Yeah, listen,
I'll--I'll come for a bit,

01:44.226 --> 01:46.494
but if it's okay with you,
I'm not going to stay.

01:46.528 --> 01:50.765
It's just, you know,
still kind of weird, right?

01:50.799 --> 01:52.600
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.435
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
mm-hmm, totally get it.

01:54.469 --> 01:55.969
Definitely get it.

01:55.988 --> 01:57.488
Ben and I don't
hang out much these days.

01:57.522 --> 01:59.540
Big deal,
lots of people don't hang out.

01:59.574 --> 02:03.811
Jerry and April.
Obama and Madonna, probably.

02:03.845 --> 02:05.162
We're in good company.

02:05.697 --> 02:08.083
Hello!

02:08.616 --> 02:11.051
So it looks like we'll each
end up with about $5,000 apiece.

02:11.086 --> 02:12.987
Stop.

02:13.021 --> 02:14.705
We get five g's each?
That's amazing!

02:14.756 --> 02:17.925
You started out with 450,000.

02:17.959 --> 02:19.527
Entertainment720 is dead.

02:19.561 --> 02:21.062
It's up in company heaven.

02:21.096 --> 02:24.799
Along with pets.com,
Blockbuster and askjeeves.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.967
My company is no better
than a company where you ask

02:27.002 --> 02:30.071
a fake butler
to Google things for you.

02:30.105 --> 02:31.939
So what's next,
Tommy Davidson?

02:31.973 --> 02:33.774
I say we invest our ten large

02:33.809 --> 02:37.010
and then I "accidentally"
get run over by a city bus

02:37.029 --> 02:38.512
and we start our own
hip-hop label.

02:39.247 --> 02:40.881
We have this place
for one more night, right?

02:40.916 --> 02:42.616
We're outtie tomorrow
at noon.

02:42.651 --> 02:45.686
What if we took
every dime we had left,

02:45.721 --> 02:47.288
threw one last party.

02:47.322 --> 02:48.456
Made it the essence

02:48.490 --> 02:50.291
of everything we wanted
the company to be.

02:50.325 --> 02:52.626
A party...

02:52.661 --> 02:54.211
For the end of the world.

02:54.246 --> 02:57.364
Shh! You had me at
"every dime we have left."

02:57.399 --> 02:59.934
Because I'm in
like Lara Flynn...

02:59.968 --> 03:02.386
Boyle... from <i>The Practice.</i>

03:02.421 --> 03:06.974
Dilly dilly dilly
dilly dilly dilly dilly swag!

03:08.310 --> 03:09.561
What should we do tonight?

03:09.595 --> 03:11.429
I don't know, I just figure
we'll just order some pizza.

03:11.480 --> 03:12.813
You watch me play Xbox,

03:12.848 --> 03:14.115
and then I could watch you
make some prank phone calls?

03:14.149 --> 03:15.549
We get hammered?
Make out?

03:15.584 --> 03:17.418
We do that every night.

03:17.452 --> 03:20.621
That's because repetition
is the key to a good marriage.

03:21.355 --> 03:23.091
Let's do something weird.

03:23.125 --> 03:24.909
Come on, it could be
the last night on earth.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.894
We could do something
off my bucket list.

03:26.928 --> 03:28.295
You have a bucket list?

03:28.330 --> 03:30.898
Catch the winning touchdown
at the super bowl.

03:30.932 --> 03:33.400
Make the most amazing
grilled-cheese sandwich ever.

03:33.435 --> 03:35.119
Win the lottery.
Ride a unicycle.

03:35.170 --> 03:36.001
Invent something.

03:36.005 --> 03:38.472
I'd like to remake the movie
<i>Shazaam</i> with Shaquille O'Neal

03:38.507 --> 03:40.241
where he plays a genie
and I'd like to get it right.

03:40.275 --> 03:41.909
Go skydiving.
Outrun a hippo.

03:41.943 --> 03:43.611
Fly first class on plane.

03:43.645 --> 03:47.548
And when people are walking by,
be like this.

03:49.918 --> 03:51.519
All right, well, this
is what we're doing tonight.

03:51.553 --> 03:53.637
- Wait, which one?
- This one.

03:53.688 --> 03:56.256
800, 900, 1,000.

03:56.274 --> 03:58.159
And how much
is left in the bank account?

03:58.193 --> 03:59.760
18 dollars
and four cents.

03:59.795 --> 04:01.762
Whoa!
Still a lot left over.

04:01.797 --> 04:06.099
Okay, you wanted to hold
$1,000 cash in your hands,

04:09.805 --> 04:13.273
that's super disappointing.

04:13.291 --> 04:16.961
998, 999, 1000.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.411
Yes!

04:18.446 --> 04:21.165
Now this is what I imagined!

04:23.552 --> 04:26.754
Have you ever seen this much
cash in your entire life?

04:26.788 --> 04:28.305
I just handed it to you.

04:28.340 --> 04:30.624
Nickels!

04:30.642 --> 04:31.625
I want nickels.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.594
- A billion nickels!
- No, Andy.

04:33.628 --> 04:34.962
Evening, gentlemen.

04:34.996 --> 04:37.598
- Hey, Ron!
- Hail Zorp.

04:37.632 --> 04:39.650
It is a beautiful night
for the end of the world.

04:39.684 --> 04:43.103
Congratulations to all of you
for reaching the finish line.

04:43.138 --> 04:45.406
The Zorpies are ridiculous.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.491
But, like the founding fathers,

04:47.526 --> 04:50.277
I believe in absolute
freedom of religion.

04:50.312 --> 04:54.014
Also their ceremonies require
the playing of flutes.

04:55.049 --> 04:58.152
I happen to make flutes
in my wood shop.

04:58.186 --> 05:00.554
Flutes are $80 apiece.

05:00.589 --> 05:02.456
And recorders are 150.

05:02.490 --> 05:05.359
Hey, they're beautiful.

05:05.393 --> 05:06.660
Would you take a check?

05:06.678 --> 05:09.346
- You can cash it tomorrow.
- Sure.

05:12.551 --> 05:14.185
Welcome to E720's

05:14.219 --> 05:16.103
end of the world celebration.

05:16.137 --> 05:18.439
The entire party's a VIP area.

05:18.473 --> 05:20.057
There's also
a double VIP area.

05:20.108 --> 05:21.859
A triple VIP area.

05:21.893 --> 05:23.944
And the Centurion Club
elite VIP area.

05:23.979 --> 05:25.279
Sponsored by Sobe Lifewater.

05:25.313 --> 05:27.248
No one's allowed in there,
not even us.

05:27.282 --> 05:28.266
Uh- uh.

05:28.267 --> 05:30.751
We also hired ten huge, scary
bouncers with earpieces.

05:30.785 --> 05:32.519
- What up, Keith?
- Mmm.

05:32.537 --> 05:34.205
He actually once tossed me
out of a club three years ago.

05:34.239 --> 05:35.539
Water under the bridge.

05:35.574 --> 05:37.992
DJ Bluntz is mixing up
some new beats.

05:38.026 --> 05:40.211
Ballers and ballerettes,
fasten your seatbelts.

05:40.245 --> 05:41.829
The perfect party begins...

05:41.863 --> 05:44.298
Clink! Now.

05:46.301 --> 05:47.968
Thank God.

05:48.003 --> 05:50.504
No one shows up
to a good party on time.

05:50.538 --> 05:52.006
If anybody actually
showed up right now,

05:52.040 --> 05:53.140
the whole party
would have been ruined.

05:53.174 --> 05:54.225
It would have been
a disaster.

05:54.259 --> 05:55.709
I don't want
to go to that party.

05:55.744 --> 05:58.646
Does the city consider them
a threat to public safety?

05:58.680 --> 06:01.565
Oh, not at all,
Shauna Malwae-Tweep.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.484
So I shouldn't interpret
anything from the fact

06:03.518 --> 06:05.519
that there are two people from
the city manager's office here?

06:05.553 --> 06:08.221
Well, nothing except that
I had nothing better to do.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.823
Which probably says
more about me than them.

06:09.858 --> 06:11.725
Thanks.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.727
- Thanks.
- Headline idea.

06:13.762 --> 06:15.462
"It's the end of the world
as they know it,

06:15.497 --> 06:17.064
but Pawnee feels fine."

06:17.082 --> 06:19.833
- It's a little long.
- Okay, "Zorp Shmorp!

06:19.868 --> 06:21.535
"Doomsday prediction
falls flat

06:21.569 --> 06:23.337
"as citizens spend
pleasant evening

06:23.371 --> 06:25.339
enjoying one of Pawnee's
finest parks."

06:25.373 --> 06:26.707
Somehow longer.

06:26.741 --> 06:28.008
Right, okay let's
go with the first one.

06:28.043 --> 06:30.261
Great, um, hey, also...

06:30.295 --> 06:32.245
He's cute.
Is he single, do you know?

06:32.264 --> 06:33.580
Chris? No.

06:33.598 --> 06:35.215
He's actually
dating Jerry's daughter.

06:35.249 --> 06:37.318
Oh, no sorry, I meant Ben.
What's his story?

06:37.352 --> 06:39.286
- Who?
- Ben?

06:39.321 --> 06:41.388
I-I don't know.

06:41.422 --> 06:44.308
I--I'm not s--
I'm not sure.

06:44.359 --> 06:46.593
He's, um,
a man and he's a worker.

06:46.611 --> 06:50.698
And he is--uh, we've never
discussed sex, so...

06:50.732 --> 06:53.734
It's--we've always just been
very businesslike, so...

06:53.768 --> 06:57.437
Your guess is as good--
nay, better than mine.

06:57.455 --> 06:59.439
The end.
By Leslie Knope.

07:00.457 --> 07:02.710
Okay.
Cool, thanks.

07:02.744 --> 07:04.778
H--happy to help.

07:04.813 --> 07:06.315
What's happening?

07:07.749 --> 07:09.383
The world is ending.

07:11.549 --> 07:13.283
Oh boy, I know how this goes.

07:13.356 --> 07:14.840
I know how Shauna operates.

07:14.874 --> 07:16.508
She smiles,
and then they fall in love,

07:16.542 --> 07:17.859
and then they get married,

07:17.894 --> 07:20.078
and then she changes her name
to Shauna Malwae-Wyatt.

07:20.112 --> 07:21.696
Or he's going
to be really progressive

07:21.731 --> 07:23.715
and change his name to
Ben Wyatt-Malwae-Tweep.

07:23.749 --> 07:26.701
God, I am so annoyed that he
would hypothetically do that.

07:26.736 --> 07:27.986
I'm gonna remind you

07:28.020 --> 07:29.237
that the reason
you're not dating him

07:29.288 --> 07:31.189
is because you decided
to run for city council.

07:31.207 --> 07:33.024
Oh, so just because
I can't go out with him,

07:33.059 --> 07:34.359
someone else can?

07:34.377 --> 07:35.911
- Oh, boy, okay.
- Wow.

07:35.962 --> 07:39.047
Okay, I'm sure
this is nothing.

07:39.781 --> 07:41.583
Okay, well, that was
definitely something.

07:41.634 --> 07:42.968
- Oh. My God.
- I know that move.

07:43.002 --> 07:44.085
They're gonna
have sex in five minutes.

07:44.136 --> 07:45.470
I've gotta stop this.

07:45.504 --> 07:46.838
I've got to keep them
away from each other

07:46.872 --> 07:47.706
for the rest of their lives.

07:47.724 --> 07:50.559
- How are you gonna do that?
- Unclear!

07:50.593 --> 07:54.179
Oh, yeah, ten bucks!

07:54.213 --> 07:55.347
That counts as
winning the lottery.

07:56.581 --> 07:58.984
Okay, now is this
the most amazing

07:59.018 --> 08:01.052
grilled-cheese
sandwich ever made?

08:01.070 --> 08:03.188
Mmm, it's pretty awesome.

08:03.722 --> 08:05.056
Honey, my bucket list
doesn't say

08:05.091 --> 08:07.792
"make a pretty awesome
grilled-cheese sandwich."

08:07.827 --> 08:09.127
Gotta go back to the store.

08:09.161 --> 08:10.629
We're gonna get
a different kind of cheese.

08:10.663 --> 08:11.746
No, no, no, dude, seriously.

08:11.781 --> 08:13.131
This is the most amazing
grilled-cheese sandwich

08:13.165 --> 08:14.199
ever made, okay?

08:14.233 --> 08:16.201
Okay. What's next?

08:16.235 --> 08:19.371
Hey, there you are.
Wow, you two are still talking?

08:19.405 --> 08:20.939
Ben hasn't bored you
to death by now.

08:20.973 --> 08:23.074
- Hey.
- So boring.

08:23.092 --> 08:24.842
Actually, we were having
a really great talk.

08:25.377 --> 08:27.245
- Keep your pants on.
- What?

08:27.280 --> 08:28.847
I mean,
keep your pants on, girl!

08:28.881 --> 08:30.482
I mean, those are
really nice pants.

08:30.516 --> 08:32.082
I really like your pants.
Where'd you get them?

08:32.118 --> 08:33.934
Do you want to go
buy some more pants?

08:33.970 --> 08:35.419
Or, um, walk away from here?

08:35.438 --> 08:37.522
I might head over to
that end of the world party.

08:37.556 --> 08:39.224
Oh, that's where all
the losers are going.

08:39.258 --> 08:41.159
Yeah, what is that?
Tom emailed me.

08:41.193 --> 08:43.727
- I could check that out.
- Hurrrrr...

08:43.763 --> 08:46.431
Well, then you should
stay here then.

08:46.465 --> 08:48.166
Because you can't go.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.101
I mean, what if you're
not here when Zorp shows up?

08:50.136 --> 08:51.269
Boy, would your face be red.

08:51.304 --> 08:52.971
When Zorp shows up,

08:53.005 --> 08:57.575
your faces will be
melted off and used as fuel.

08:58.210 --> 08:59.477
You want to be here
for that.

08:59.512 --> 09:00.812
I think
I'll take my chances.

09:00.846 --> 09:03.465
Leslie, thanks as always.

unpleasant person.

The perfect party.
It's an elusive idea.

09:21.934 --> 09:23.351
People have to be
completely entertained

from the moment they walk in,
to the moment they leave.

09:26.305 --> 09:27.906

No, this is
a great gas station.

13:25.344 --> 13:29.414
This gas station
was owned by... Mick Jagger.

13:29.448 --> 13:30.982
Uh-huh.

13:31.016 --> 13:32.233
I came across
some financial records

13:32.268 --> 13:33.735
when I was doing
some research for my book,

13:33.769 --> 13:35.253
and this gas station was owned

13:35.287 --> 13:37.755
by an M. Jagger, which at first
I thought was a woman.

13:37.790 --> 13:40.358
Maybe Meg or something,
but I think

13:40.392 --> 13:42.360
the most likely explanation

13:42.394 --> 13:45.597
is that legendary Rolling Stones
front man Mick Jagger

13:45.631 --> 13:48.900
owned this gas station
from 1951 to 1958.

13:49.934 --> 13:51.469
I know what you're doing,
Leslie.

13:51.503 --> 13:53.538
I'm showing you a part
of Rock and Roll history.

13:53.572 --> 13:56.808
You--you can't do this.
You know we broke up.

shouldn't...

14:00.045 --> 14:03.181
Hang out together,
just the two of us.

14:03.215 --> 14:05.750
Because every time we do,
it just makes it harder.

14:05.784 --> 14:08.152
You know?

14:08.187 --> 14:09.520
Okay.

14:11.523 --> 14:13.191
Okay.

14:18.523 --> 14:20.051
I think we've done
everything on the list

14:20.052 --> 14:21.252
that we can actually do.

14:21.303 --> 14:22.887
What about this?

14:22.922 --> 14:25.006
Oh, my God,
that would be awesome.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.908
- It's impossible.
- No, it isn't.

14:27.442 --> 14:28.943
We have $1,000
in our bank account,

14:28.978 --> 14:30.178
and we're young
and irresponsible.

14:31.415 --> 14:32.414
I mean, our car
would break down.

14:32.448 --> 14:33.748
There's no way we
could even get there.

14:33.783 --> 14:36.050
So I'll steal my dad's car.

14:36.068 --> 14:39.187
Look, this is a stupid idea,
but right at this exact second,

14:39.221 --> 14:41.523
we have enough momentum
to do something stupid

14:41.557 --> 14:42.924
before we realize
how stupid it is.

14:42.958 --> 14:47.946
You are absolutely right.
No thinking, just stupid.

14:47.997 --> 14:49.564
Yes!

14:49.582 --> 14:51.833
Buddhists feel
that human beings

14:51.867 --> 14:54.536
are unlikely to be
reincarnated as human beings.

14:54.570 --> 14:57.005
So the problem
with reincarnation

14:57.039 --> 14:59.107
is that you could be
reborn as a pretzel.

14:59.741 --> 15:01.376
Or a socket wrench.

15:02.010 --> 15:03.011
Ron, if you could
be reincarnated,

15:03.045 --> 15:04.646
what would you like to be?

15:04.680 --> 15:07.482
Socket wrench sounds
pretty good, actually.

15:07.516 --> 15:09.584
What religion am I?

15:09.618 --> 15:13.388
Well, I'm a practicing none
of your [Bleep] Business.

15:13.422 --> 15:16.391
I think the danger in
believing in reincarnation

15:16.425 --> 15:18.226
is that you spend so much
time trying to figure out

15:18.260 --> 15:19.928
what you're going to be
in the next lifetime

15:19.962 --> 15:22.397
that you forget to enjoy
the one you're in now.

15:22.931 --> 15:26.301
Ann Perkins...
that was beautiful.

15:28.604 --> 15:31.939
Drum lines,
personalized gift bags, tigers.

This is the best
party I've ever been to.

15:33.609 --> 15:34.776
And I'm not just saying that.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.661
For real, T.T.,
think about it, man.

15:37.212 --> 15:40.081
It's pretty great.
But it's not perfect.

Hey, Lucy,
what are you doing here?

15:44.803 --> 15:45.953

15:47.723 --> 15:49.190

15:50.459 --> 15:52.093

15:53.262 --> 15:54.896
Yeah, yeah!
Uh, give me a minute.

15:54.930 --> 15:55.931
Okay.

15:57.465 --> 15:59.300
I can't believe
you called her for me.

15:59.835 --> 16:01.236
That's really nice
of you, man, for real.

16:01.270 --> 16:02.537
Thanks.

16:02.571 --> 16:04.305
No, no, no, thank you.

16:04.323 --> 16:07.609
I mean for everything.

16:12.364 --> 16:14.115

they ever dated.

16:14.149 --> 16:16.951

about a personal matter?

16:32.433 --> 16:34.536
Normally, no.

16:34.570 --> 16:36.855
But... given there's
only 20 minutes

16:36.889 --> 16:38.740

of human existence...

16:38.774 --> 16:40.341
Also, no.

16:40.376 --> 16:41.943
I lost my mind tonight.

16:41.977 --> 16:45.847
I tried to screw up
even the potential of Ben

16:45.881 --> 16:47.181

16:47.216 --> 16:48.950

when I said no?

16:48.984 --> 16:51.119
Oh, we broke up
because of me.

16:51.653 --> 16:54.789
But I have to
tell you, Ron...

16:56.725 --> 16:59.193
If the world
was ending tomorrow,

16:59.928 --> 17:02.263
I'd want to be with him.

17:03.298 --> 17:06.134
Well, that's significant.

17:06.167 --> 17:10.137
Problem is, Leslie, the world's
not ending tomorrow.

17:10.172 --> 17:12.574
The sun's going to rise
right over there.

17:13.108 --> 17:15.343
It'll be a regular Friday,

17:15.377 --> 17:18.012
and you'll be in the exact same
position you were in before.

17:19.047 --> 17:20.080
I know.

17:20.115 --> 17:21.616
It's just the thought
of him with someone else

17:21.650 --> 17:22.951
is making me miserable.

17:23.484 --> 17:25.486
If it makes you feel
any better, Leslie,

17:25.521 --> 17:27.739
we'll all be dead
in 20 minutes.

17:28.773 --> 17:31.225

18:26.715 --> 18:28.683
- Hey!
- Hey.

18:28.717 --> 18:30.051
- It's great seeing you.
- You too.

18:30.085 --> 18:32.503
Are, uh, you sticking around
for a bit, or...

18:32.554 --> 18:34.188
Nah, I'm heading to
Bloomington right now.

18:34.223 --> 18:35.890
- Oh.
- Grad school's fun,

18:35.924 --> 18:38.009
but I do miss this town.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.595
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?

18:41.629 --> 18:42.597
I don't know.

18:42.631 --> 18:44.849
After this is done,
I'm gonna be broke,

18:44.900 --> 18:46.701
and I'm not gonna
have a job.

18:46.735 --> 18:48.152
Well,
if it's any consolation,

18:48.687 --> 18:51.022
this was honestly the best
party I've ever been to.

18:51.873 --> 18:52.657
Hey, it was pretty great.

18:52.691 --> 18:55.777
I-I was really
aiming for something--

18:58.814 --> 19:02.784
I'll see you around.

19:02.818 --> 19:04.919
Whoo.

19:05.453 --> 19:07.789
You saw that.

19:08.123 --> 19:09.223
You saw that too.

19:13.696 --> 19:16.030
Shauna Malwae-Tweep
thinks you're cute.

19:16.565 --> 19:17.715
- What?
- That's why I took you

19:17.766 --> 19:19.166
to Mick Jagger's
abandoned gas station.

19:19.184 --> 19:20.601
Because she thinks you're
cute, and I was afraid

19:20.636 --> 19:21.936
you guys were gonna
make out and have babies,

19:21.970 --> 19:23.838
and I had no right
to do that to you

19:23.856 --> 19:25.857
or your future children.

19:25.891 --> 19:27.809
And it wasn't until just now

19:27.843 --> 19:30.144
that I realized
the romantic part

19:30.179 --> 19:32.914
of our relationship is over.

19:32.948 --> 19:34.782
So... I'm sorry.

19:34.817 --> 19:37.685
And, uh, why don't you tell
Shauna to make herself decent

19:37.720 --> 19:40.254
and I'll apologize
to her as well.

19:41.089 --> 19:45.326
Oh, well,
Shauna's not here.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.628
- Oh.
- See what I did?

19:47.663 --> 19:48.696
- I do.
- I'm very sneaky.

19:50.114 --> 19:51.532
Okay, okay, well....

19:51.567 --> 19:53.167
♪ ♪

20:25.400 --> 20:26.567
It's so much more beautiful

20:26.602 --> 20:28.102
than I could have
ever even imagined.

20:28.637 --> 20:30.238
Yeah.

20:30.672 --> 20:33.458
I'm trying to find a way
to be annoyed by it, but...

20:34.209 --> 20:35.510
Coming up empty.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.595
Thank you so much.

20:37.629 --> 20:40.381
I never would have ever
done this without you.

20:41.015 --> 20:41.983
Thank you.

20:46.438 --> 20:50.391
Where's all the faces?
Like the presidents.

21:00.184 --> 21:03.587
All the scholarly work
that I did on these texts?

21:03.621 --> 21:06.423
Indicated that
the world would end.

21:06.457 --> 21:08.525
Oh, gosh, I'm as disappointed
as you are, Herb.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.728
Yeah, but I went home and
began to reevaluate the texts.

21:12.262 --> 21:13.730
You don't say.

21:13.764 --> 21:16.733
And I realized that
I'd made some crucial errors

21:16.767 --> 21:18.602
well, math is hard.

21:18.636 --> 21:21.488
Yes, well, the actual
end of the world is May 19.

21:21.522 --> 21:23.240
Okay, let's see
what we've got.

21:23.274 --> 21:25.742
Um, oh, on the 19th
we can't give you the park.

21:25.776 --> 21:28.695
We have a Spring spectacular
free ice cream giveaway.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.997
Heh! I misspoke.

21:31.032 --> 21:32.516
Yeah, it's May 20?

21:33.550 --> 21:34.518
That is free.

21:34.552 --> 21:35.952
- Ah!
- Okay.

21:35.986 --> 21:37.587
End of World, May 20th.
