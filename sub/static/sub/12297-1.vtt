WEBVTT

03:29.251 --> 03:32.004
Go away, we don't want beggars here.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.714
I'm not a beggar, I'll pay...

03:35.465 --> 03:37.634
for food and lodging for the night.

03:37.801 --> 03:41.305
If you want to pay,
give me seeds or new tools...

03:41.471 --> 03:44.349
give me a horse,
raise my sons from the dead...

03:44.433 --> 03:46.101
or stop this stinking war.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.936
Go away or we'll drive you away.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.230
I'll work or write letters...

03:50.522 --> 03:53.317
or tell you about
the places I've seen, anything.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.777
I need only a little food.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.864
Can't you see we are starving? Go away.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.201
Live, die. What difference does it make?

04:02.284 --> 04:04.912
Jesus has forsaken us. Go away.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.230
Plague.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.303
Where are the others?

12:42.346 --> 12:44.848
I don't know, I came here alone.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.284
Not a soul, Captain, except this bastard.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.496
Where are your friends?

13:08.247 --> 13:10.290
And where are your cattle?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.212
Wake him up.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.217
I don't know.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.513
I came here alone this morning after food.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.224
I've never seen this valley before.

13:27.391 --> 13:31.144
That won't do. Speak fast.
I lost patience 12 years ago.

13:32.229 --> 13:34.565
Two ears are better than 40, Captain.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.191
You can't bargain with me.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.320
I can crush you and your village
like a bedbug.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.907
That's what I want to talk to you about.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.288
Break open every house.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.707
Gather all we can use in that barn...

13:51.748 --> 13:53.876
nothing in your own saddlebags.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.045
We'll round up the peasants...

13:57.129 --> 13:59.381
and fire the village at leisure.

14:01.300 --> 14:05.095
Korski, over there. You, come with me.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.222
I don't like secrets.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.394
You can come, too, Korski.

14:27.576 --> 14:28.576
Well?

14:29.161 --> 14:31.246
There's famine all over Germany...

14:31.622 --> 14:33.916
plague, pestilence, even now...

14:34.750 --> 14:36.502
and winter's coming.

14:37.628 --> 14:41.089
In 10, 20 years,
have you seen a richer valley?

14:41.298 --> 14:43.300
I don't answer uestions.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.803
Take their grain and cattle,
and they starve this winter.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.598
I'm tiring of you. Come to your point.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.309
I'm there now, Captain.

14:52.976 --> 14:57.814
Take all this food back to your army,
and down it goes into a thousand stomachs.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.108
Why such waste?

15:01.235 --> 15:04.238
Winter here, occupy the valley.

15:04.613 --> 15:05.697
What?

15:06.031 --> 15:07.282
Winter here.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.910
Live while your army dies.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.913
You'll never get another chance like this.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.415
Is this scum asking us to desert?

15:17.793 --> 15:19.044
Is that it?

15:19.336 --> 15:21.672
A soldier has no future and no past...

15:22.506 --> 15:24.591
and a full belly covers the present.

15:24.675 --> 15:27.719
You talk too much, and not like a peasant.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.722
What are you? A stinking priest?

15:31.890 --> 15:34.726
I don't know which side you're on, Captain.

15:35.686 --> 15:38.355
But I'll wager half your men don't care.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.652
What of those who do care?

15:50.576 --> 15:52.160
Get rid of them.

16:04.256 --> 16:07.050
Good ideas are rare these days.

16:08.177 --> 16:09.553
Very rare.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.473
You are a priest on the run?

16:13.557 --> 16:15.184
No, I was a teacher.

16:15.851 --> 16:18.562
- What's your name?
- Vogel. Yours?

16:19.146 --> 16:21.607
Captain. Where are you from?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.902
From nowhere, everywhere, Captain.

16:26.111 --> 16:29.364
Yes, I have almost forgotten...

16:30.073 --> 16:31.909
where I was born, also.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.165
You have fever?

16:40.501 --> 16:41.960
No, it's nothing.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.713
Didn't you say, "Get rid of them"?

16:45.255 --> 16:48.008
Yes, but it was so sudden.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.551
And clean.

16:49.927 --> 16:52.471
One moment alive, one moment dead.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.393
You philosophers are such hypocrites.

17:00.604 --> 17:03.232
I only do what is necessary.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.192
No more.

17:05.275 --> 17:10.239
If to kill is necessary,
I do it without conscience.

17:11.198 --> 17:15.618
Now, make peace
with whatever God you worship.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.958
Peasants hate soldiers, Captain.
Soldiers hate peasants.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.419
I'm not a soldier or a peasant.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.257
I could speak to them
just as I can speak to you.

17:28.966 --> 17:30.342
I can help.

17:31.009 --> 17:34.304
You'll need help. I'll be very useful.

17:42.396 --> 17:45.607
I'll give you two days to prove it.

17:51.405 --> 17:53.407
No more looting, Captain?

17:55.158 --> 17:56.159
No.

17:56.535 --> 18:00.080
We eat the place at leisure
and drink it dry by spring.

18:00.163 --> 18:01.164
Spring?

18:01.373 --> 18:03.792
We'll eat while the army starves.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.920
By the Madonna,
I'd give my life for a winter of peace...

18:07.004 --> 18:10.799
with good food, decent women,
and maybe no killing.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.431
Where's Korski?

18:19.141 --> 18:21.852
Where else would Korski be, but on watch?

18:22.686 --> 18:26.231
We found the valley, other patrols could.
Ours, or enemy.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.442
That's right, Captain.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.068
What about our women?

18:30.319 --> 18:32.779
Yes, I have a wife and family back there.

18:32.863 --> 18:35.324
What about the army and the baggage train?

18:35.407 --> 18:36.992
Listen to Hansen...

18:38.160 --> 18:41.163
plenty of women
where there's plenty of food?

18:41.330 --> 18:43.332
Has it ever been different?

18:43.707 --> 18:46.126
And isn't one as good as another?

18:48.754 --> 18:50.506
But we've been winning all year.

18:50.589 --> 18:54.092
How much pay we got?
Not a god-rotting pfennig.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.638
I say we stay. It's a good valley.
A miracle.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.973
I say it stinks of Satan.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.767
You stink of Satan.

19:09.066 --> 19:11.235
How else could it be like this?

19:13.862 --> 19:17.574
Perhaps we've been led
into the Promised Land, Eskesen.

19:29.753 --> 19:30.879
Then it's agreed?

19:30.921 --> 19:32.381
- Yes.
- No.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.591
I've got a woman back there.

19:40.097 --> 19:42.808
First, I want to hear what Korski says.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.855
Korski will know what's right.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.490
Graf, take him to join Korski.

19:59.908 --> 20:01.910
Yes, Captain. Come on.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.204
Move.

20:23.974 --> 20:27.311
Remember, be careful
as you circle and hide.

20:28.187 --> 20:32.274
This ambush must be perfect,
and no killing.

20:33.317 --> 20:35.277
But what about that, Captain?

20:35.569 --> 20:37.487
It stays. Untouched.

20:37.696 --> 20:41.200
But we burn all churches on raids.
That's your rule.

20:41.491 --> 20:44.536
Yes, but this time, we must bend the rule.

20:44.953 --> 20:48.040
Catholic or Protestant,
it would make no difference.

20:48.624 --> 20:51.251
This time, we need the peasants to work.

20:51.543 --> 20:54.713
That church must be an exception.
The exception.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.840
But it stinks of Satan.

20:57.341 --> 20:59.468
It's the breeding place of evil.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.262
So it will burn.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.891
Stop him.

21:11.522 --> 21:14.358
Get away, or you'll join Shutz and Korski.

21:19.863 --> 21:23.659
Lord Jesus, help me to strike down
Thine enemies.

21:26.078 --> 21:27.329
Papist scum!

21:27.829 --> 21:29.456
The church stays.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.124
Anti-Christ.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.335
Devil worshipper.

21:33.418 --> 21:36.880
Ours is the true faith, by God,
you Protestant heretic.

21:36.964 --> 21:38.423
Blasphemer!

21:38.882 --> 21:40.843
Death to the anti-Christ!

21:52.729 --> 21:54.940
Make your peace with your God.

21:55.399 --> 21:57.025
Mercy, Captain.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.112
Our first rule...

22:00.195 --> 22:02.906
is no religious uarrels among ourselves.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.618
He who breaks it is a dead man.

22:09.246 --> 22:11.832
Let him also be an exception.
The exception.

22:12.749 --> 22:16.712
Let the church stay, but let him
and the Protestants build another church.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.591
Yes, give him uarter.

22:33.437 --> 22:35.689
Let one man escape that rule...

22:35.939 --> 22:38.233
and we'll all be dead by sundown.

22:39.276 --> 22:42.446
You all swore holy oaths
to fight as a unit...

22:42.529 --> 22:46.241
and sell your skill to the winner,
whatever their religion.

22:47.951 --> 22:51.330
Protestants may build if they wish
without hindrance.

22:52.456 --> 22:55.584
Vornez, Geddes, Tub...

22:56.293 --> 22:58.962
burn him along with the others.
We want no plague here.

23:47.886 --> 23:50.556
- Go on. Run along.
- Yes, Inge.

24:02.693 --> 24:06.154
Go to your homes. Go.

24:33.724 --> 24:35.017
Vornez!

24:37.269 --> 24:38.854
I said no killing.

24:49.948 --> 24:51.950
Who will speak for all of you?

24:58.457 --> 25:00.417
- Here, you.
- Fetch Gruber.

25:01.919 --> 25:03.670
It should be Gruber.

25:09.968 --> 25:11.553
Where is he?

25:12.095 --> 25:13.096
Captain...

25:13.972 --> 25:16.183
let him take me to Gruber.

25:16.892 --> 25:19.603
I'll speak to him for you, if you wish.

25:21.146 --> 25:23.982
And then you'll come back? Like a lamb.

25:24.274 --> 25:27.819
Within the hour,
or you'll go after him, Hansen.

25:28.362 --> 25:29.738
You and Pirelli.

25:29.988 --> 25:32.741
You take him to Gruber.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.622
You can all...

25:44.711 --> 25:46.839
You can all go to your homes.

25:49.383 --> 25:51.301
You are safe for the moment.

25:51.677 --> 25:53.929
Why not kill us all now
and be done with it?

25:53.971 --> 25:57.266
- Butchers!
- You're young, so you're impatient.

25:57.349 --> 25:59.810
Be patient, puppy. Wait your turn to die.

26:08.402 --> 26:10.070
What is your name?

26:12.155 --> 26:13.699
Erica Torfield.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.452
Which is your husband?

26:28.422 --> 26:29.923
Why trust him?

26:32.509 --> 26:33.886
I trust no one.

26:47.024 --> 26:48.442
My name is Vogel.

26:48.901 --> 26:51.320
I bring a message from the Captain.

26:51.445 --> 26:53.822
I persuaded them
to let me come alone with him.

26:53.906 --> 26:56.533
- There's about 20 of them.
- That can wait.

26:58.368 --> 27:01.538
Do you have pains in your throat,
in your chest?

27:02.039 --> 27:03.832
Is it hard to swallow?

27:04.666 --> 27:06.126
He has plague?

27:11.882 --> 27:15.427
The Captain undertakes to protect
your village from all other soldiers...

27:15.511 --> 27:19.515
on condition that he and his men
be well-billeted for the winter.

27:20.766 --> 27:24.937
The power of Jesus Christ
and Our Lady of the Shrine protects us.

27:25.229 --> 27:27.523
We don't need any soldiers here.

27:28.023 --> 27:30.359
The Captain is a reasonable man.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.571
If you accept, nothing will be looted.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.449
Your women won't be tampered with.

27:38.742 --> 27:40.494
No one will be hurt.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.830
If not, your valley will die.

27:43.914 --> 27:45.290
Enough talk.

27:45.457 --> 27:48.919
If the Captain will keep
discipline, I agree.

27:56.134 --> 27:58.720
What has changed that we need soldiers?

27:58.762 --> 28:02.140
The soldiers are here, Father.
That's what has changed.

28:03.058 --> 28:05.894
Our Lady of the Shrine will rid us of them.

28:07.271 --> 28:09.898
In good time, Father, in good time.

28:13.110 --> 28:14.570
Is he unclean?

28:32.671 --> 28:34.173
I have plague?

28:34.256 --> 28:37.217
Do you think you'd be here,
or us watching if you had?

28:37.301 --> 28:38.427
You're sure?

28:38.468 --> 28:41.096
You have had a palsy. You're safe now.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.683
Drink some more, it will
help you get better.

28:47.644 --> 28:49.521
I had terrible dreams.

28:49.897 --> 28:51.857
You talked in your sleep.

28:52.024 --> 28:56.111
You seemed to be talking
to Holy Father, to God.

28:56.820 --> 29:01.241
I can't remember. I
dreamed that I was dead.

29:01.533 --> 29:04.328
You would have been
if it wasn't for my mother and Erica.

29:04.411 --> 29:08.123
They brought you here.
We've looked after you for two days.

29:09.124 --> 29:11.585
I feel born again. Thank you.

29:11.919 --> 29:14.463
Your clothes are filthy.
We're going to wash them.

29:14.546 --> 29:16.048
Why are you so kind to me?

29:16.131 --> 29:18.967
Because we think you're worth caring about.

29:19.009 --> 29:20.302
Thank you.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.347
And the village?

29:24.431 --> 29:25.682
All is peaceful?

29:25.766 --> 29:26.767
No!

29:28.060 --> 29:31.772
We're soldiers, by God. We take what
we want, and to hell with the rest.

29:31.855 --> 29:34.066
That's what we've always done.

29:35.651 --> 29:38.237
The next time you oppose me, Hansen...

29:40.113 --> 29:42.115
I will slit your tongue.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.503
The penalty for rape...

29:55.254 --> 29:58.048
will be public castration.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.009
And for looting?

30:02.803 --> 30:05.013
What is your pleasure, Father?

30:05.597 --> 30:06.849
Blinding.

30:08.016 --> 30:11.186
How else do we protect our homes,
if not by fear?

30:12.980 --> 30:14.314
Very well.

30:14.439 --> 30:16.692
For Catholics, blinding.

30:17.067 --> 30:18.986
For the rest, 100 lashes...

30:19.152 --> 30:22.698
all provided my men
have women of their own.

30:24.199 --> 30:27.369
There are two or three widows
who might be prepared to be visited...

30:27.452 --> 30:28.495
Eight.

30:30.414 --> 30:34.293
Or perhaps two dozen
will become widows by sundown.

30:35.294 --> 30:36.670
Four, then.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.131
Six, and they had better be worthy...

30:39.381 --> 30:41.175
and the place worthy.

30:41.758 --> 30:43.719
And you, Father...

30:44.928 --> 30:48.515
you will give them
public blessing for their penance.

30:49.099 --> 30:51.977
I obey God's orders, not your orders.

30:52.227 --> 30:55.397
Of course, but why not sell them...

30:55.564 --> 30:57.399
your holy indulgence...

30:57.858 --> 31:00.694
a total remission for
past and future sins...

31:01.028 --> 31:03.488
which you could pay for?

31:06.450 --> 31:09.870
Six. Widowed, married, or unmarried.

31:11.205 --> 31:12.206
You have two days.

31:23.008 --> 31:24.468
What are you doing here?

31:24.510 --> 31:27.429
I was treating someone
who was sick, Father.

31:27.721 --> 31:30.307
You said to treat all without favor.

31:31.225 --> 31:35.479
I asked her to see him, Father.
It was just Christian charity.

31:36.813 --> 31:39.024
Good night, Erica. Thank you.

31:52.329 --> 31:56.250
So the philosopher is risen from the dead.

31:56.625 --> 31:59.211
He was ready to die, he should have died.

31:59.294 --> 32:01.255
Why wasn't I told that he was here?

32:01.338 --> 32:04.132
Perhaps they didn't want my soup poisoned.

32:04.216 --> 32:08.303
What are you, Lutheran Protestant,
Calvin Protestant...

32:08.720 --> 32:12.432
blasphemous Anabaptist,
heathen Satan worshipper?

32:12.850 --> 32:16.812
That's unimportant.
I have all those among my men and worse.

32:16.895 --> 32:19.231
I even have Catholics, Father...

32:20.732 --> 32:24.111
which brings me to the
shrine near the pass.

32:24.528 --> 32:28.282
Our Lady of the Shrine has guarded
the valley for centuries.

32:28.866 --> 32:32.369
Many of my men think
that shrines are blasphemous idols...

32:32.452 --> 32:35.080
that should be torn apart
and stamped into oblivion.

32:35.163 --> 32:36.874
Touch the shrine...

32:37.082 --> 32:40.669
and you will burn in
hellfire for all eternity...

32:41.420 --> 32:44.548
- and your entrails will be eaten with worms.
- The pox on hellfire!

32:44.631 --> 32:47.134
That shrine is pointing at the village
like a finger.

32:47.217 --> 32:49.344
Touch one stone...

32:50.053 --> 32:51.847
and God will smite you.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.975
But before that, we will rise up.

32:55.225 --> 32:57.019
We will rise up...

32:57.102 --> 33:00.522
and stamp you to oblivion.

33:07.404 --> 33:09.031
How have you survived so long?

33:09.198 --> 33:12.451
For almost six months of the year,
from the first snows...

33:12.534 --> 33:14.745
the road is blocked, we are safe.

33:15.996 --> 33:19.541
These mountains are cruel,
the country stripped bare.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.294
Few come this way.

33:22.377 --> 33:25.005
How he got in, only God knows.

33:25.422 --> 33:29.551
So, where could the shrine be moved to?

33:33.764 --> 33:35.390
Stay here. Vogel.

33:55.035 --> 33:56.912
Here, beside the rock.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.207
Good. Very good.

34:03.126 --> 34:05.337
We keep our lookout up there.

34:05.462 --> 34:08.340
A lookout is enough if
your plan is to hide.

34:08.757 --> 34:11.134
We fight for our valley.

34:20.768 --> 34:21.768
Captain...

34:24.106 --> 34:26.775
don't move the shrine. It saved the valley.

34:26.984 --> 34:29.735
A shrine is still a shrine 30 paces off.

34:29.820 --> 34:32.947
Other villages had mountains
and false trails and clever leaders...

34:33.031 --> 34:34.408
but that didn't save them.

34:34.491 --> 34:36.577
Other villages had shrines.

35:01.560 --> 35:02.561
Hurry.

35:35.135 --> 35:36.720
In your name...

35:38.889 --> 35:41.058
Holy Mother, in your name.

35:50.317 --> 35:51.902
I'm sick of this pig-swill.

35:51.985 --> 35:55.906
By the blood of Christ, Korski'd never let
these stink-pest scum run over him.

35:55.989 --> 35:57.199
Korski'd be king.

35:57.241 --> 35:59.243
Not a weak-gutted lackey.

35:59.368 --> 36:00.827
Korski's dead.

36:01.411 --> 36:03.539
Yes, I'm sorry I let him die.

36:04.706 --> 36:06.583
Sorry I sided with the Captain.

36:07.084 --> 36:09.253
- I'm as good a soldier as him.
- You're wrong.

36:09.378 --> 36:11.046
Korski was a turd.

36:11.630 --> 36:12.965
Be patient.

36:13.465 --> 36:16.093
This Captain's clever and strong.

36:16.510 --> 36:18.470
The best I ever served with...

36:18.554 --> 36:20.180
and we get the women tomorrow.

36:20.264 --> 36:23.559
We'll get bags. The pox on this place.

36:24.476 --> 36:28.730
There's good women in the camp, wine,
dice and good times, and loot to be had.

36:28.814 --> 36:31.191
I've a kid back there.
Who'll look after him?

36:31.275 --> 36:32.734
He'll be there next spring.

36:33.026 --> 36:34.862
If not, you can make another.

36:38.156 --> 36:42.411
You know, they say that
the plague's taken 10,000 men already.

36:43.662 --> 36:45.998
We're blessed with luck to be here.

36:46.331 --> 36:49.918
I'm for staying a week.
Take what we want and the hell with it.

36:57.342 --> 37:00.304
- Sorry, Father, I'm late.
- Next time you're late, no food.

37:00.387 --> 37:01.763
Yes, Father.

37:02.973 --> 37:04.016
Good.

37:08.353 --> 37:10.689
They say you can read and write.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.109
I studied at the university in Heidelberg.

37:14.193 --> 37:17.362
Then I taught there. The town was sacked.

37:17.863 --> 37:21.200
Your family were
burghers there? Shopkeepers?

37:21.825 --> 37:23.952
No, at Magdeburg.

37:24.661 --> 37:27.998
I envy you, seeing so many places
and knowing so much.

37:28.290 --> 37:29.499
You needn't.

37:29.583 --> 37:33.712
Before I was your age, I had seen two
brothers murdered, and one dead of plague.

37:35.214 --> 37:36.465
Sit down.

37:41.178 --> 37:43.931
It's years since I've seen bread so rich.

37:44.181 --> 37:45.933
The harvest was good.

37:46.016 --> 37:48.685
Our Lady is pleased for us to share it.

37:50.604 --> 37:52.981
How do you earn your daily bread?

37:53.023 --> 37:56.151
Work. Any form of work except soldiering.

37:57.027 --> 37:58.403
I can paint a little...

37:58.487 --> 38:02.157
I can teach writing, history, mathematics.

38:02.407 --> 38:04.535
I can speak Spanish, Italian, French.

38:04.618 --> 38:07.663
Father Sebastian teaches here.
The Holy Word.

38:07.996 --> 38:10.374
We've no need for writing
or the other nonsense.

38:10.749 --> 38:12.501
Works of the devil.

38:12.876 --> 38:15.379
Why did you lead the soldiers here?

38:15.838 --> 38:17.005
I didn't.

38:17.464 --> 38:19.216
I was trying to get away...

38:20.133 --> 38:21.844
from all soldiers.

38:22.928 --> 38:25.264
Some men are good luck, some bad.

38:25.597 --> 38:27.140
You are bad luck.

38:27.933 --> 38:32.062
- Your soldiers will kill our valley.
- No. Not if everyone works.

38:32.354 --> 38:34.565
Peasants, landowners, and soldiers.

38:34.648 --> 38:37.150
You are a fool as well as bad luck.

38:41.154 --> 38:44.783
Tonight, you are alive
enjoying the fat of the land.

38:45.701 --> 38:46.785
Bless your luck.

38:47.077 --> 38:49.371
Our Lady protects us, not luck.

38:53.667 --> 38:56.879
Here, Vogel, eat.
Then tell us about the Holy City.

38:57.379 --> 38:59.673
Father, Vogel was there when he was young.

38:59.756 --> 39:03.677
Once, he saw a real pope and the
whole city's gold and the cathedral.

39:04.636 --> 39:06.930
Your pardon, "Meister" Hoffman.

39:09.808 --> 39:11.268
But, is it true about Inge?

39:11.351 --> 39:13.395
Yes. Come, sit down.

39:13.770 --> 39:15.939
Eat with us, share our joy.

39:17.024 --> 39:19.902
Vogel is going to tell
us about the Holy City.

39:19.943 --> 39:23.030
But, it was always planned
that we would be married some day.

39:23.113 --> 39:26.074
Eternal salvation is better
than earthly happiness, boy.

39:26.116 --> 39:27.659
Sit down.

39:29.786 --> 39:31.079
Salvation?

39:31.413 --> 39:34.291
I'm to be one of the
women for the soldiers.

39:34.625 --> 39:39.087
If you were going to be a nun, to
serve God, then I could understand.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.424
But this, it's not right.

39:43.425 --> 39:44.927
It's whoring.

39:45.010 --> 39:46.720
Has Satan put a spell on you?

39:46.803 --> 39:49.389
You heard what Father Sebastian said:

39:49.473 --> 39:53.435
"Their suffering would save the village just
as Christ's suffering saved the world."

39:53.644 --> 39:55.270
Yes, I heard him.

39:55.604 --> 39:58.565
But that doesn't make him right.
He's not right!

39:58.649 --> 40:01.401
Get out of my house!

40:05.322 --> 40:06.907
You offered her?

40:08.116 --> 40:10.494
They are to get a holy indulgence.

40:10.869 --> 40:12.788
Gruber is paying for it.

40:13.080 --> 40:16.500
If he pays the church in land,
of course it is right.

40:17.459 --> 40:21.964
What father would not want
eternal salvation for his daughter?

40:38.438 --> 40:40.524
Captain, can I speak to you?

40:45.279 --> 40:47.781
It's about Inge, Hoffman's daughter.

40:50.450 --> 40:53.161
Refuse her, accept another in her place.

40:53.662 --> 40:57.291
- You want to take away her salvation?
- No.

40:58.959 --> 41:02.171
Gruber has agreed
that the shrine should be moved.

41:02.713 --> 41:05.340
- What is your counsel?
- Don't touch it.

41:06.258 --> 41:08.260
The priest doesn't agree.

41:08.844 --> 41:12.890
Gruber is our only guarantee
of peace with the peasants.

41:13.807 --> 41:17.060
They are all frightened of him,
all in debt to him.

41:18.061 --> 41:21.064
What Gruber says must be done, is done.

41:22.900 --> 41:26.737
No one can control this valley as he can.

41:27.905 --> 41:30.866
No one is rich enough or shrewd enough...

41:32.075 --> 41:33.660
or has his courage.

41:35.412 --> 41:38.248
It is not wise to make an enemy of Gruber.

41:39.082 --> 41:40.292
Or you.

41:40.667 --> 41:44.046
Or Graf, Hansen, Hoffman,
the list is endless.

41:44.546 --> 41:47.591
Gruber was right.
We need the counsel of clever men.

41:47.674 --> 41:50.427
From tomorrow, you are appointed judge...

41:50.844 --> 41:53.347
between soldier and peasant for all cases.

41:53.430 --> 41:56.767
I'm the last person to do that.
I've no authority over anyone.

41:56.850 --> 41:59.728
Gruber agrees
that you are the perfect political choice.

41:59.770 --> 42:01.146
We will both back you.

42:01.355 --> 42:04.399
I'll be hated by everybody
and blamed by both sides.

42:04.608 --> 42:07.402
A few days ago, life was impossible.

42:08.070 --> 42:10.155
Now you want it to be easy.

42:10.948 --> 42:13.408
I want a rest. Time.

42:14.451 --> 42:17.120
You're on borrowed time now, Judge.

42:19.498 --> 42:22.876
So is the village, the whole valley.

42:24.378 --> 42:25.963
It's all doomed.

42:29.550 --> 42:31.009
And the girl?

42:31.468 --> 42:32.761
She is trouble.

42:34.638 --> 42:35.806
So are you.

42:42.980 --> 42:44.815
The Captain wants you.

42:45.524 --> 42:47.192
You'll protect me?

42:47.442 --> 42:48.944
I could kill him easily.

42:49.570 --> 42:51.572
But that would destroy our world.

42:51.655 --> 42:54.575
Only he keeps them
from falling on us like wolves.

42:56.535 --> 42:59.121
Then kill them all while they sleep.

42:59.746 --> 43:01.623
We haven't the weapons.

43:02.165 --> 43:04.543
There's too many, they're too clever.

43:04.626 --> 43:06.795
Some patrol while others sleep.

43:07.880 --> 43:10.174
Then put hemlock in their food.

43:11.633 --> 43:12.676
Perhaps.

43:13.135 --> 43:15.429
But not yet, not until the snows.

43:16.054 --> 43:17.139
Why?

43:17.306 --> 43:19.641
They found us, so others can.

43:19.933 --> 43:21.810
We need them to protect us.

43:28.650 --> 43:30.110
Open the door.

43:34.198 --> 43:35.407
Open it.

43:55.219 --> 43:58.430
She will not be one of the women
for the soldiers.

43:58.847 --> 44:02.643
Of course. The others are for my men.

44:04.895 --> 44:08.315
It is a pity that you
are involved with her.

44:09.483 --> 44:12.778
However, you are involved.

44:16.823 --> 44:18.617
How do we decide this?

44:26.583 --> 44:29.002
Dice. Fetch them, Erica.

44:33.590 --> 44:36.927
If I win, you'll leave her alone
and protect her from your men.

44:37.010 --> 44:38.887
- Agreed.
- Three throws.

44:39.805 --> 44:41.265
Highest score.

44:41.390 --> 44:44.852
If eual,
one more throw until there is a loser.

44:45.978 --> 44:47.271
If you lose...

44:47.938 --> 44:51.024
you accept that she is mine?

45:02.202 --> 45:03.245
Agreed.

45:05.330 --> 45:06.456
Seven.

45:24.224 --> 45:26.143
Seven and nine are sixteen.

45:32.983 --> 45:36.069
Ten and three are thirteen.

45:43.911 --> 45:46.788
Sixteen and six make twenty-two.

46:04.848 --> 46:07.017
What do the dice read, Erica?

46:17.736 --> 46:19.196
Six and five.

46:50.227 --> 46:51.687
Bar the door.

47:33.604 --> 47:35.564
Father! Quickly!

47:38.525 --> 47:40.611
What happened to your face?

47:40.944 --> 47:44.072
There were some feathers flying last night,
little bird.

47:44.573 --> 47:46.241
We get the women at sunset.

47:46.366 --> 47:48.744
That'll put an end to the violence.

47:48.785 --> 47:50.704
- Who's that?
- Pirelli.

47:51.121 --> 47:54.208
He truly thinks
he's got the voice of an angel.

47:55.667 --> 47:58.545
Father, the Captain's
moving the shrine! Quickly.

48:01.381 --> 48:03.509
The Captain's moving the shrine.

48:06.345 --> 48:07.638
That priest.

49:02.568 --> 49:05.946
This way leads out of the valley.
No one is to leave.

49:06.238 --> 49:07.698
I'm going to the shrine.

49:07.781 --> 49:10.659
You're going back to the village,
black beetle.

49:13.829 --> 49:14.829
Leave it.

49:17.082 --> 49:19.001
Stop, in God's name.

49:29.136 --> 49:30.179
Run.

49:31.346 --> 49:32.598
Stop him.

49:35.559 --> 49:38.687
The next time,
your head leaves your shoulders.

49:38.937 --> 49:41.648
- I'll get them.
- Leave them. They're only fools.

49:42.441 --> 49:44.026
Take this man to the Captain.

49:44.109 --> 49:47.029
Martyrdom is not as useful
as you think, Father.

49:47.237 --> 49:49.281
Christ saved the world by suffering.

49:49.573 --> 49:51.033
And was it necessary?

49:51.241 --> 49:52.451
You blaspheme.

49:52.576 --> 49:55.704
No. The politicians put him to death.

49:56.288 --> 49:59.041
How many men do you think
should die for the shrine?

49:59.082 --> 50:01.585
We're not concerned for the shrine,
for its own sake...

50:01.668 --> 50:04.922
but because it's a symbol of faith.

50:05.547 --> 50:07.382
Beg God's forgiveness.

50:07.591 --> 50:10.260
Does 30 paces make such a difference
to a whole faith?

50:10.344 --> 50:12.054
Yes. And you were warned.

50:12.262 --> 50:14.223
We have not harmed the shrine.

50:14.890 --> 50:17.226
It is exact, stone by stone.

50:17.267 --> 50:19.228
You were warned. Confess your sins.

50:19.311 --> 50:22.105
Prepare for hellfire and God's wrath.

50:22.523 --> 50:24.107
And the devil's.

50:24.441 --> 50:27.736
Any shrine in this world
is a shrine to the devil.

50:29.863 --> 50:33.700
Priests are better on their knees,
in the god-poxed holy dirt.

50:34.701 --> 50:36.286
Idol worshipper.

50:36.620 --> 50:39.623
He's a priest. So he worships nothing.

50:40.374 --> 50:42.459
Can I slit his throat now?

50:45.462 --> 50:46.547
Captain, uick.

50:47.130 --> 50:48.590
They're moving the shrine.

51:12.656 --> 51:15.409
Better cut around them. Too many to stop.

51:17.160 --> 51:21.748
We'll talk. We did what was necessary,
and peasants understand necessity.

51:23.083 --> 51:26.587
Get ready.
Kill Pirelli, Hansen, and Vornez first...

51:26.670 --> 51:28.881
and watch out for that
devil's whelp, Julio.

51:29.047 --> 51:31.633
We can cut around and get the horses.

51:31.925 --> 51:34.261
No time. We have the advantage.

51:34.428 --> 51:36.930
You talk. I'll see that he doesn't.

51:37.306 --> 51:38.307
No.

51:39.516 --> 51:40.726
Father...

51:42.519 --> 51:45.772
you will talk on my behalf...

51:47.232 --> 51:50.485
or make your peace with your God
for you and them.

51:52.196 --> 51:56.491
There will be no uarter,
not for man, woman, nor child.

51:59.077 --> 52:02.039
And you will be castrated
before I hack off your feet.

52:46.124 --> 52:48.544
Did they touch the shrine, Father?

52:48.961 --> 52:52.714
Don't be afraid, Father. We are soldiers
of Christ. We will protect you.

52:55.425 --> 52:57.469
Did they touch the shrine?

53:00.764 --> 53:01.807
Yes!

53:01.932 --> 53:05.227
Our Lady has been taken to another place.

53:05.477 --> 53:08.188
You're all going to die...

53:08.897 --> 53:11.525
and Satan walks the earth.

53:19.199 --> 53:22.035
The shrine has not been harmed.

53:25.289 --> 53:29.084
Listen, give thanks to Our Lady.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.004
She protected us again.

53:36.800 --> 53:39.887
Our Lady has protected
our valley for centuries.

53:40.220 --> 53:41.722
We all know that.

53:42.514 --> 53:45.267
But that didn't prevent you
from digging up the track...

53:45.309 --> 53:49.438
nor planting forests, nor visiting
her shrine by a hundred paths...

53:50.314 --> 53:52.065
nor hiding when soldiers came...

53:52.149 --> 53:54.651
nor concealing your fowl,
and cattle, and horses...

53:54.735 --> 53:57.112
nor keeping lookouts at the pass.

53:57.738 --> 53:59.531
I am a Catholic, too.

54:01.033 --> 54:02.951
I had a dream last night.

54:06.496 --> 54:07.831
I dreamed...

54:09.875 --> 54:12.085
that I was near the shrine...

54:13.170 --> 54:17.216
and a regiment of soldiers
came riding up under a full moon.

54:18.675 --> 54:21.595
There was a sprinkling of snow
on the ground.

54:23.055 --> 54:25.015
They were huge and evil...

54:25.849 --> 54:28.477
and they looked towards the shrine.

54:29.394 --> 54:31.104
But as they looked...

54:32.606 --> 54:34.441
the shrine vanished.

54:35.817 --> 54:38.487
So the soldiers went their way
back to Rheinfelden...

54:38.529 --> 54:40.322
and never came back.

54:41.698 --> 54:44.952
By hiding herself,
Our Lady had hidden the village.

54:49.414 --> 54:52.918
I am glad the Captain has moved
Our Lady of the Shrine.

54:53.001 --> 54:55.587
Isn't that what the dream said to do?

54:56.547 --> 54:59.132
You wouldn't defy a dream, would you?

55:05.013 --> 55:06.473
You're lying.

55:07.933 --> 55:09.935
He never had a dream.

55:10.310 --> 55:13.188
Go to the shrine. See for yourselves.

55:16.900 --> 55:19.862
Is he telling the truth, Father,
about the dream?

55:28.662 --> 55:30.122
I don't know.

55:30.581 --> 55:32.291
Do we go to the shrine?

55:36.879 --> 55:39.173
Do we go to the shrine, Father?

55:42.009 --> 55:43.802
Where is there to go?

55:59.568 --> 56:01.403
Pirelli, lead the way.

56:11.622 --> 56:15.626
You are not to be one of the women
for my men.

56:15.709 --> 56:19.505
- She's the one I want.
- You can't have her.

56:57.668 --> 56:59.461
You wanted to see me?

57:00.128 --> 57:02.464
Did you really dream that dream?

57:06.051 --> 57:08.053
What's real, and what isn't?

57:10.806 --> 57:12.641
Once, I thought I knew.

57:14.977 --> 57:16.395
Now I know I don't.

57:16.478 --> 57:20.232
The true church is real.
God is real, and Satan is real.

57:20.941 --> 57:25.696
That we're all going to die soon
and face judgment is real.

57:26.905 --> 57:30.492
Before God, did you tell the truth?

57:30.909 --> 57:32.953
Before God, what is the truth?

57:33.036 --> 57:35.706
That millions are dead and more will die...

57:35.831 --> 57:38.709
because the Pope wars
on the Catholic Emperor...

57:38.917 --> 57:43.338
who wars on the Catholic King of France,
who wars on the Catholic King of Spain...

57:43.422 --> 57:45.507
who wars on Catholic Germany...

57:46.008 --> 57:48.051
all helped by Protestants.

57:48.510 --> 57:52.055
Helped by a hundred other princes,
kings, and bishops...

57:52.639 --> 57:55.017
all for their own rotten purposes.

57:55.058 --> 57:59.021
Nothing is simple.
Nothing except faith in God.

58:00.314 --> 58:02.941
You ask uestions only God can answer.

58:03.192 --> 58:05.527
God is an excuse that's used too often.

58:05.611 --> 58:07.112
You blaspheme.

58:07.196 --> 58:09.948
Life exists because of a divine pattern.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.535
You must have faith and believe...

58:13.619 --> 58:16.622
or you will cast your immortal soul
into the pit.

58:16.705 --> 58:18.916
Look at your own soul, priest.

58:19.541 --> 58:23.086
I do. And I look to those in the valley.

58:23.837 --> 58:25.130
All of them.

58:25.297 --> 58:27.758
I am the shepherd of this flock.

58:29.092 --> 58:32.054
Since you came here,
Satan has walked aboard.

58:32.554 --> 58:34.389
I feel it.

58:36.225 --> 58:39.228
But soon, Our Lady will give me a sign...

58:39.770 --> 58:41.772
and then I will know what to do.

59:16.932 --> 59:18.308
Very pretty.

59:33.532 --> 59:34.950
That's mine.

01:00:00.976 --> 01:00:03.103
This valley is so peaceful.

01:00:04.104 --> 01:00:07.065
It would be easy to become possessed by it.

01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:12.321
Does it make you feel
in the presence of God, Captain?

01:00:14.156 --> 01:00:16.158
Don't talk to me of God.

01:00:16.658 --> 01:00:18.994
We killed God at Magdeburg.

01:00:19.912 --> 01:00:21.872
We laid that city flat...

01:00:21.955 --> 01:00:24.458
butchered men, women, and children...

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:27.336
20,000, 30,000.

01:00:27.419 --> 01:00:30.005
And then we burned the lot.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.509
- Why?
- Vengeance.

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:38.180
You know,
that was vengeance for one of our cities...

01:00:38.388 --> 01:00:40.432
which was vengeance
for one of their towns...

01:00:40.516 --> 01:00:43.477
for one of our villages,
for one of their hamlets...

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.063
which was probably destroyed
in the first place...

01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:49.149
to give some fat little princeling...

01:00:49.399 --> 01:00:51.485
a better view of the Rhine.

01:00:52.694 --> 01:00:54.821
Magdeburg is that simple.

01:00:57.366 --> 01:00:59.159
My family were there.

01:01:00.202 --> 01:01:01.912
My father, mother...

01:01:03.205 --> 01:01:05.749
my wife, and my son.

01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:11.171
Then they have been dead for 12 long years.

01:01:13.966 --> 01:01:16.927
We all have things we would like to forget.

01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:20.556
Magdeburg is mine.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.477
What is yours, Vogel?

01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:31.358
Gruber.

01:01:34.194 --> 01:01:35.195
Good.

01:01:35.863 --> 01:01:38.115
He'll wish he stayed in the mountains.

01:01:38.532 --> 01:01:41.952
Captain, the shrine is settled.

01:01:42.244 --> 01:01:45.205
The women, well, that's settled.

01:01:46.415 --> 01:01:48.876
Leave the valley in peace for a while.

01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:51.962
If I do that, he'll gain the initiative.

01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:54.131
Does that matter?

01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:58.760
It matters very much,
because then he will kill us.

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.101
Captain, I've been to the road.

01:02:06.185 --> 01:02:08.353
There are fresh tracks, many horses.

01:02:08.437 --> 01:02:09.771
I know.

01:02:10.022 --> 01:02:13.609
Tomorrow, we search
the village very thoroughly...

01:02:13.901 --> 01:02:15.819
for secret hoards of food.

01:02:15.944 --> 01:02:19.406
Soldiers. They do nothing but loot,
and are never satisfied.

01:02:19.448 --> 01:02:21.992
Gold, silver, and jewelry, you keep.

01:02:22.743 --> 01:02:26.038
But the food we put in a common store
and guard it.

01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:29.917
If the food is to be in one store,
better the soldiers are, too.

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:33.462
- I'll find a big enough house.
- Better leave them where they are.

01:02:33.545 --> 01:02:35.839
Then any trouble will be small.

01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:38.842
Yes, very wise.

01:03:19.383 --> 01:03:20.384
So.
