00:41.275 --> 00:44.545
* Every time that you go by

00:44.578 --> 00:48.782
* Boy, you smile at me,
and you take my breath away *

00:48.816 --> 00:52.686
* Every time
I catch your eye *

00:52.720 --> 00:56.724
* I can see that you've got
a whole lot more to say *

00:56.757 --> 01:00.394
* So don't be shy
'cause I'm waiting here *

01:00.428 --> 01:04.598
* Hoping you'll
open your heart *

01:04.632 --> 01:08.269
* The more I wait,
and more I find *

01:08.302 --> 01:12.606
* I can't get you
off my mind *

01:12.640 --> 01:17.578
* Whatever the season,
whatever I'm going through *

01:17.611 --> 01:20.548
* I'm always
thinkin' of you *

01:20.581 --> 01:25.419
* 'Cause you are the reason
for all that I say and do *

01:25.453 --> 01:29.123
* You've got to believe
that it's true *

01:29.157 --> 01:31.159
* Hey, baby

01:31.192 --> 01:33.327
* In big ways and small ways

01:33.361 --> 01:36.830
* I'm always thinkin' of you

01:54.548 --> 01:57.385
* How you do it I don't know

01:58.652 --> 02:00.354
* I keep having dreams

02:00.388 --> 02:02.423
* And you're
all I'm dreamin' of *

02:02.456 --> 02:06.160
* Every day my feelings grow

02:06.194 --> 02:08.262
* I keep thinking, baby

02:08.295 --> 02:10.497
* That maybe this is love

02:10.531 --> 02:14.134
* I was alone,
but now that you're here *

02:14.168 --> 02:18.272
* I'm finally feeling alive

02:18.306 --> 02:21.875
* The more I feel,
the more I find *

02:21.909 --> 02:26.447
* I can't get you
off my mind *

02:26.480 --> 02:28.549
* Whatever the season

02:28.582 --> 02:31.452
* Whatever I'm goin' through

02:31.485 --> 02:34.322
* I'm always thinkin' of you

02:34.355 --> 02:39.193

02:39.227 --> 02:42.696
* You've got to believe
that it's true *

02:42.730 --> 02:44.832
* Hey, baby

02:44.865 --> 02:46.800
* In big ways and small ways

02:46.834 --> 02:50.170
* I'm always thinking of you

02:53.874 --> 02:55.343
* From the time I wake up

02:57.845 --> 03:01.649
* Till I fall into bed

03:01.682 --> 03:05.519
* I've got pictures of you

03:05.553 --> 03:08.656
* Runnin' straight
through my head *

03:08.689 --> 03:12.326
* I think it's clear
as A B C *

03:12.360 --> 03:17.898
* That's the way
love's 'sposed to be *

03:31.879 --> 03:35.516
* The more I feel,
the more I find *

03:35.549 --> 03:40.754
* I can't get you
off my mind *

03:41.989 --> 03:43.957
* Whatever the season

03:43.991 --> 03:46.860
* Whatever I'm goin' through

03:46.894 --> 03:49.797
* I'm always thinkin' of you

03:49.830 --> 03:51.765
[fading]
* 'Cause you are the reason

03:51.799 --> 03:54.568
* For all that I say and do

03:54.602 --> 03:58.038
* You've got to believe
that it's true *

03:58.071 --> 04:00.441
* Hey, baby, hey, baby

04:00.474 --> 04:02.476
* In big ways and small ways

04:02.510 --> 04:05.879
* I'm always thinking of you

04:05.913 --> 04:08.949
Sylvia: Mary, honey,
come and eat breakfast!

04:15.088 --> 04:16.490
Jack:
* Pom-pom

04:16.524 --> 04:17.891
* M-m-mama-a-popala

04:17.925 --> 04:20.494
* M-m-mama-a-popala,
mama-a-popala *

04:20.528 --> 04:23.397
* Huh-hum, mama,
huh-hum, mama *

04:23.431 --> 04:25.599
* Ha-ha, m-mama
Oh, look at you.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.768
Just the person
I've been waiting for.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.604
- Good morning, buttercup.
- Good morning, Jack.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.407
Will you please help me pick
a tie for today's interview?

04:33.441 --> 04:34.742
How's this one grab you?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.478
No? Too traditional?
Absolutely right.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.279
How 'bout this one?

04:39.313 --> 04:41.582
Too avant garde.
I knew that.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.484
How about--
No, I hate that one.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.519
- How about this one?
- I like that one.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.920
Yeah? Then this is the one.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.022
What would I do without you?

04:49.056 --> 04:51.325
Did you see my red shoe?

04:51.359 --> 04:54.428
Your red shoe?
No, I don't think I have.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.829
But wait a minute.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.599
If I were a red shoe,
where would I hide?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.768
I know. Right over here.
Ha ha! No.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.436
Uh, here? No.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.771
Uh, what about back here?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.473
Nope. Whoo!

05:10.811 --> 05:13.714
Mary, honey,
your breakfast is ready!

05:13.747 --> 05:15.048
[hissing]

05:16.984 --> 05:18.652
[Mary humming]

05:24.392 --> 05:26.460
Are you going
to the "inner"?

05:26.494 --> 05:28.496
The interview?
Of course I am.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.797
I'm gonna
meet your teachers,

05:29.830 --> 05:31.131
tell 'em what a great
kid you are

05:31.164 --> 05:32.500
and that they
have to take you.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.334
What should I wear?

05:34.368 --> 05:36.136
Let's pick something out.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.071
Oh, thanks.
I needed that.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.041
- There you go.
- Mary.

05:41.074 --> 05:44.545
Go eat your breakfast.
Hurry up.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.647
Did you get that review
I put on your desk?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.081
Yes, I got it, thank you.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.817
I loved seeing
that guy eat crow

05:49.850 --> 05:51.852
after what he said
about you in Doll's House.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.021
Don't you take my reviews
a little too personally?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.523
No, I don't think so.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.024
Every time
we're in a restaurant

05:57.057 --> 05:58.559
and you see a critic,

05:58.592 --> 06:00.360
you want to throw
your butter knife at him.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.430
I would've got the last guy
if he hadn't moved.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.598
Oh, you missed a spot.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.117
Hello, lovely ladies.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.719
Hello. Here's
your breakfast, Michael.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.888
Thanks. Toast is done.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.557
[gasp] Damn!

06:30.924 --> 06:33.594
Jerry, I know
what I'm talking about.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.429
I realize you're
trying to save money,

06:35.463 --> 06:38.632
but we are building an office
for 12,000 people.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.802
You can't put a bathroom
on every other floor.

06:41.835 --> 06:45.739
What if they don't go
before they come to work?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.708
Fine, okay.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.077
I'll hold.
Morning, everyone.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.745
- Morning, Pete.
- Morning.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.581
Can you believe how people
try to save money?

06:53.614 --> 06:54.882
Is that Jerry again?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.450
Yeah, the Albert Schweitzer
of real estate.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.953
Oh, no!

06:59.987 --> 07:01.555
Oh, no, look.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.791
My foot must have
grown last night.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.025
That's my shoe, silly.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.228
Thank God.
I thought it was me.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.598
Mary, don't you like
your oatmeal?

07:10.631 --> 07:12.099
It tastes like rubber.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.834
It's supposed to
taste like rubber.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.569
- What a crock.
- Hey, hey, hey.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.837
Where did you hear
that expression?

07:16.870 --> 07:18.939
What a crock!

07:21.475 --> 07:22.910
What? What'd I do?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.512
Just...

07:24.545 --> 07:25.913
Finish getting dressed,
honey.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.915
I'll fix you
something else.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.116
Jack:
Now scoot.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.789
Oh. Did I say overnight?

07:35.823 --> 07:37.090
I meant over light.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.592
You don't like my eggs?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.193
You kidding me?
I love your eggs.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.262
That's the best part
about you.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.097
They're perfect,
just like you are.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.099
Look. Hey.
You did your hair.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.868
Oh, someone noticed.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.671
Are we ready
for the interview?

07:50.704 --> 07:51.972
- Absolutely.
- Definitely.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.174
Yes, we are ready.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.510
What about
your commercial shoot?

07:56.544 --> 07:58.011
They gave me an hour off.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.881
Jack, this is the school
we want Mary to go to.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.116
I know. I've been here
during the five years

08:03.150 --> 08:05.285
it took us to decide
on this place, remember?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.521
They put less research
into the SALT treaty.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.989
Primary school
is the first--

08:09.022 --> 08:11.058
First watershed event
of a child's life.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.793
Have I said that before?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.127
Not in the last
five minutes, Pete.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.829
Hey, I'll be there.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.698
Just don't be late.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.533
Have I ever
let you down before?

08:28.208 --> 08:31.011
Sylvia: Now, Mary, while we're
talking with the ladies,

08:31.044 --> 08:33.145
you'll be in a class
with other boys and girls.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.514
Okay.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.002
Relax.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.571
This isn't going to hurt.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.907
You know,
I think we'd better start.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.042
I think it's getting late.
Yes, it is.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.045
So you're the architect?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.246
That's right.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.682
And you are
the cartoonist?

09:08.716 --> 09:09.883
Actually,
I'm a satirist.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.919
Michael draws Johnny Cool.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.554
Oh, that cute kitten.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.289
Well, he's really
not a kitten.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.792
He's a cat who
symbolizes the angst

09:18.826 --> 09:20.694
of the single man
in our times.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.896
I just adore that
little hat he wears.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.297
And Mr. Holden is...

09:24.331 --> 09:25.733
The actor.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.034
But very stable.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.268
Salt of the earth.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.870
Not one of these
fellas that's--

09:29.903 --> 09:31.204
Michael,
I think they know

09:31.238 --> 09:32.906
that actors
are normal people.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.777
Good afternoon!

09:36.810 --> 09:38.912
Oh, my God!

09:40.013 --> 09:41.649
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.651
I didn't mean to frighten you.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.385
Please forgive the makeup.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.954
I'm in the middle
of a commercial shoot

09:46.987 --> 09:49.957
for Fairlawn Margarine.
I play Count Cholesterol.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.126
Probably seen me on TV,
huh?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.628
How do you do?

09:54.662 --> 09:56.730
Hmm. How do you do?

09:56.764 --> 09:59.399
Rrr. Ha ha ha.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.702
I had a hell of a time
catching a cab.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.640
What? Oh!

10:06.674 --> 10:07.841
Thank you.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.609
Ooh.

10:09.643 --> 10:10.911
Lookit.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.412
Mary's drawn a picture
of her family.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.148
Isn't that wonderful?
That's wonderful, Mary.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.349
Is that you?

10:16.383 --> 10:18.752
Yeah?
Is that your mommy?

10:18.786 --> 10:19.987
Yes.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.755
And who's that?

10:21.789 --> 10:23.957
That's my biological daddy.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.093
Oh. Who's that?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.261
That's my one honorary daddy,

10:28.295 --> 10:30.297
and that's my other
honorary daddy.

10:30.330 --> 10:33.633
We all live together.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.368
Okay.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.304
[bell rings]

10:37.337 --> 10:39.439
Everybody put the tops
back on your markers

10:39.472 --> 10:41.742
and take your drawings
up to the front.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.947
You have three daddies?
That's weird.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.448
How come?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.050
Julie has two daddies,

10:50.083 --> 10:51.985
but not at the same time.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.220
Why not?

10:53.253 --> 10:55.155
You can't have
more than one father

10:55.188 --> 10:56.957
at a time living with you.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.325
That's the law.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.296
What's the role
of other women in the home?

11:03.330 --> 11:04.898
None whatsoever.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.133
Can't say I even remember

11:06.166 --> 11:07.868
seeing any in the house.
You, Michael?

11:07.901 --> 11:10.070
Strictly professional,
right down the line.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.304
Oh, then you're gay.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.706
- What?
- Is she kidding me?

11:12.740 --> 11:14.307
Are we gay? No!

11:14.341 --> 11:16.710
Pete, how many women
you been out with
this month?

11:16.744 --> 11:18.145
That's hard to say.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.313
I need a calculator
to count the number
of women--

11:20.347 --> 11:21.749
We have a strict rule:

11:21.782 --> 11:23.150
there are to be
no overnight guests

11:23.183 --> 11:24.684
while Mary's in the house.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.253
Well, you realize

11:26.286 --> 11:28.922
this is a most unique
family environment.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.224
As a school psychologist,
I must say here,

11:31.258 --> 11:32.993
and I've told
the committee this

11:33.026 --> 11:34.494
in no uncertain terms

11:34.527 --> 11:37.330
that I was most
impressed by Mary.

11:37.364 --> 11:41.034
I found her to be
a thoroughly delightful
and happy child.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.036
- Yes, she is.
- Thank you.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.938
Having said that,
however,

11:44.972 --> 11:47.040
I must warn you that
she's coming to an age

11:47.074 --> 11:49.042
when differences,
even slight ones,

11:49.076 --> 11:52.045
can threaten her sense
of fitting in.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.947
The littlest things:

11:53.981 --> 11:57.050
a parent's accent,
how they dress,

11:57.084 --> 11:59.119
what they look like.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.454
And while we think of
ourselves as progressive

12:01.488 --> 12:03.023
here at the Morgan School,

12:03.056 --> 12:05.225
I'd be less than candid

12:05.258 --> 12:07.194
if I said that three men

12:07.227 --> 12:09.362
without any
legal responsibility

12:09.396 --> 12:11.899
didn't concern me
a great deal.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.466
We have responsibilities.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.468
I know what you're trying
to say, Mrs. Heard,

12:15.502 --> 12:17.805
and I feel I should be
the one to respond to that.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.473
I know some of the children
in this school,

12:20.507 --> 12:22.309
and I know their parents.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.945
Family life is not easy.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.080
But of all the fathers,
the stepfathers,

12:27.114 --> 12:28.916
the half-fathers
that I've known,

12:28.949 --> 12:31.819
no three men support
and love a child

12:31.852 --> 12:33.787
like these men love Mary.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.989
There is nothing
they wouldn't do for her.

12:36.023 --> 12:39.226
I can only hope that when
it comes to fathers,

12:39.259 --> 12:42.830
the children in this school
are as lucky as Mary is.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.239
Ha! Ha!

12:52.272 --> 12:55.008
Yeah, you're in.
Congratulations.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.144
Ha ha! Look at you.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.313
What's the matter?

13:00.347 --> 13:02.115
Stuff.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.017
What kind of stuff?

13:04.051 --> 13:06.419
I don't know.
I feel different.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.088
Says who?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.356
People.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.824
Oh.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.926
Well, who cares
what people think?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.327
People think
that I'm different.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.929
You are.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.597
Yeah, well, so, see?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.599
That's good.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.170
Listen, let me tell you
something here.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.839
It's okay
to be different.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.375
You don't have to be
like everybody else.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.110
Okay?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.979
Okay.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.516
Okay.
Now, unfortunately,

13:36.549 --> 13:38.952
your daddy has to
go off and be famous.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.620
But you, ha-ha.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.956
Ho-ho!

13:42.990 --> 13:46.559
But you--
you are mine forever.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.996
Ha ha ha ha! Boola!

13:49.029 --> 13:51.064
Anything you want, Mare.
Money's no object.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.565
The hamburgers
look great!

13:52.599 --> 13:54.034
What can I get
for you?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.502
Do you have a penis?

14:02.910 --> 14:04.878
Can we hear
your specials, please?

14:04.912 --> 14:07.214
This table is
a little wobbly here.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.016
Uh, give us a minute, please.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.020
Mary,
that's a very adult word.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.521
Where did you hear it?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.189
Jenny said her father

14:16.223 --> 14:17.991
and her brother
have a penis.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.192
What is it?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.495
Peter, you're the architect.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.397
Why don't you
explain it to her?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.669
The penis is

14:29.702 --> 14:32.505
the urinary
and the copulatory organ

14:32.539 --> 14:35.175
of the male mammal.
It's composed primarily--

14:35.208 --> 14:36.443
Thank you.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.677
What?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.112
Did you memorize that?

14:39.146 --> 14:42.015
I bet he says that
to all the girls.

14:42.049 --> 14:45.152
Mary and I are going
to wash our hands.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.028
I can't believe
she said that.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.964
I know.
I didn't know about sex
till I was in college.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.231
I'm stunned.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.100
I was exaggerating,
Peter.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.568
I'm talking about Mary,
Michael.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.703
She's not a baby anymore.
Don't you see?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.606
That one word
was like a trumpet

15:06.639 --> 15:09.376
announcing her adulthood
in deafening volume.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.278
First comes penis,
then comes--

15:11.311 --> 15:12.579
Pete, could you
say it louder?

15:12.612 --> 15:14.214
I don't think
the chef heard you.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.382
It's like
the psychologist said.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.583
She's susceptible

15:16.616 --> 15:18.418
to the outside world
now: boys, sex.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.453
- You're overreacting.
- I'm overreacting, huh?

15:20.487 --> 15:22.455
Yeah, what's a genital
here and there?

15:22.489 --> 15:25.258
Shh. Look, be quiet.
They're coming.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.635
Pbblllt! Ppbbllt!

15:35.668 --> 15:37.104
[laughing]

15:37.137 --> 15:38.571
- Pbbllt!
- Stop, Peter, stop!

15:38.605 --> 15:41.241
I can't! My God!
My lips are stuck!

15:41.274 --> 15:42.609
- It tickles!
- I can't get 'em unstuck.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.677
I'll never get off!
Pbbllt!

15:44.711 --> 15:46.279
Hey, what are you doing?

15:46.313 --> 15:48.181
His lips are stuck
to my stomach!

15:48.215 --> 15:49.416
Oh!

15:49.449 --> 15:51.251
Whoa! Whoa!

15:51.284 --> 15:52.752
Boy, that was a close one!

15:52.785 --> 15:54.454
Good night! I gotta go.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.655
Good night.

15:55.688 --> 15:58.625
You two are crazy!

15:58.658 --> 16:01.594
It's time for you
to go to bed, little lady.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.530
- Have sweet dreams.
- Okay.

16:03.563 --> 16:04.964
Okay.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.021
Hi, Stan. How you doing?

16:28.055 --> 16:29.322
Good evening,
Miss Bennington.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.735
Hello, gorgeous.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.404
Hello, darling.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.406
Look what Mary made for you.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.076
What a talent.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.144
Look, love,
I need to talk to you.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.181
What? I did something wrong
last night, didn't I?

16:54.214 --> 16:57.184
I know. I missed a cue at
the end of the first act?

16:57.217 --> 16:59.386
Sylvia, relax.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.021
You were
your brilliant self.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.659
I have been asked to direct
Midsummer Night's Dream

17:06.693 --> 17:08.161
at The National
in the autumn.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.496
Really?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.731
Oh, congratulations.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.766
And I want you
to play Helena.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.702
Me?

17:15.734 --> 17:17.604
Yes, you.
You'll be sensational.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.106
Will you do it?

17:19.138 --> 17:20.573
I'd love to do it.

17:20.607 --> 17:21.840
But?

17:21.874 --> 17:23.675
Mary's starting school here.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.377
Take her with you.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.348
We do have schools
in England, remember?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.517
Her family is here.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.385
Your roommates, you mean?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.187
They're more than roommates.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.722
Look, I realize that.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.524
It's a wonderful offer,

17:37.557 --> 17:41.861
but it's a crucial time
for Mary.

17:41.894 --> 17:46.433
It's, uh, it's not because
of our relationship, is it?

17:46.466 --> 17:48.368
No, not at all.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.138
Because my asking you
is purely professional.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.772
You know that I never
let my emotions

17:52.805 --> 17:55.208
interfere with my
professional decisions.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.777
Except, of course,
when I'm horny.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.746
- [chuckling]
- Hmm.

17:59.779 --> 18:03.082
Look, I won't pretend
that I don't adore you

18:03.116 --> 18:04.551
or that I wouldn't
give anything

18:04.584 --> 18:06.419
if you'd finally
agree to marry me.

18:06.453 --> 18:11.624
I know. But I have to
consider Mary's needs.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.267
And what about your needs?

18:24.471 --> 18:26.206
I'll think about it.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.451
[door closes]

18:44.291 --> 18:45.592
There you go.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.794
What's this button?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.429
Don't touch that.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.631
That's the delete button.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.433
How do I get it
to move?

18:53.466 --> 18:55.602
Move the cursor down.
Try it.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.836
[beep]

18:56.869 --> 18:58.438
- I did it.
- Good. See?

18:58.471 --> 18:59.606
That was easy, wasn't it?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.441
[humming]

19:01.474 --> 19:03.343
What about Mary's new shoes?

19:03.376 --> 19:05.178
Got 'em yesterday.

19:05.212 --> 19:08.648
Mary has a dentist appointment
Friday morning.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.383
I've got my cooking class.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.719
- Jack, can you cover it?
- Yeah. Consider it done.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.488
Who's coming to the airport
to pick up my mother?

19:15.522 --> 19:17.224
Your mom? Oh, damn!

19:17.257 --> 19:19.292
I have that kidney operation
this afternoon.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.860
What about you, Pete?

19:20.893 --> 19:23.296
Michael, I'll give you
$1,000 if you'll do it.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.897
I would if I could,
but I can't.

19:24.931 --> 19:28.368
I've got a meeting
with my, um, publisher.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.470
I thought you had a date
with Laurie tonight.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.804
No, that's
tomorrow night.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.641
You know something?
I like Laurie.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.975
So do I.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.344
Been a while,
huh, Michael?

19:37.377 --> 19:38.645
She's been in L.A.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.547
How's it going
with you two?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.315
That's what we're
gonna talk about.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.351
Time to fish
or cut bait, huh?

19:44.384 --> 19:45.818
That's really romantic,
Peter.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.820
"Time to fish
or cut bait, darling."

19:47.854 --> 19:49.222
You'd be surprised
how practical

19:49.256 --> 19:50.523
women are about these things.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.325
No matter what they say,

19:52.359 --> 19:54.527
a woman wants to be
swept off her feet.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.529
Kind of like I swept you
off your feet, huh?

19:56.563 --> 19:58.931
Knocked me off my feet
is more like it.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.900
I think
women want security.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.202
You know what I want?

20:03.236 --> 20:07.006
I want a man to make
a fool of himself over me.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.576
I'd make a fool of myself
over you any day, honey.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.578
Mm-mm-mm.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.249
Anyway, Michael,
you're not breaking up
with Laurie, are you?

20:16.283 --> 20:18.618
No. We just
have to shake our
relationship up.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.388
Nothing shakes up
a relationship like marriage.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.456
Marriage? Who said
anything about marriage?

20:23.490 --> 20:26.025
Hey, I don't know if I like
this attitude around Mary.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.960
How come none of you
are married?

20:27.994 --> 20:30.597
- Oh, um...
- Oh, um...

20:30.630 --> 20:32.865
I'd like to get back
to that question
about the penis.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.567
We never did cover that.

20:34.601 --> 20:35.802
Come along, darling,

20:35.835 --> 20:37.704
before you're
permanently warped.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.274
...announces the arrival
of Flight 103 from London.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.542
Thank you
for coming with me.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.777
- I can always count on you.
- Sure.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.380
- Darling!
- Ah, Mother!

20:47.414 --> 20:49.316
It's wonderful
to see you.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.917
Welcome,
Mrs. Bennington.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.719
- Michael.
- Peter.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.421
Oh, yes.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.556
Jack really wanted to come,
but he was busy.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.725
Spreading his seed, no doubt.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.394
How is Mary?

21:01.428 --> 21:03.563
Oh, you won't believe
how much she's grown.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.831
- Really?
- Oh, she's so...

21:09.636 --> 21:10.770
Michael.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.476
Michael. Bag.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.615
What? No furniture?

21:28.655 --> 21:31.624
- Oh, thank you, Michael.
- Peter.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.629
Oh, look.
It's the biological one.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.298
Mom.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.767
Why, when you say it,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.935
does that sound
such a frightening word?

21:42.969 --> 21:44.504
Great to see you.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.038
You're looking so--
so close.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.375
Gosh, I hope you can
stay for a while.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.976
Mother's staying
at The Plaza.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.511
Yes, it's just a stopover.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.779
I'm leaving the day
after tomorrow.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.313
Oh, gee, so soon?

21:56.583 --> 21:57.884
Come along, Mother.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.686
I've made your favorite
biscuits.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.990
Oh, good shot, Mom.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.792
Don't you think you can
stay longer, Vera?

22:05.825 --> 22:07.727
I tried
to change her mind.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.730
[shivering] Did someone leave
a window open in here? Brr!

22:10.763 --> 22:11.964
Right. In you get, darling.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.734
Lie down. That's it.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.669
Oh, lovely.

22:16.703 --> 22:21.841
Now, tomorrow, we can
do anything you want to.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.076
Can we toss a Frisbee?

22:24.110 --> 22:27.547
Well, we'll discuss that
in the morning.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.016
Now, would you like me
to sing you a lullaby?

22:30.049 --> 22:31.718
I want a rap song.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.655
Oh.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.856
Kick it!

22:36.889 --> 22:39.426
Tss, tss, tss,
tss, tss-- huh!

22:39.459 --> 22:42.929
[imitating boom box beat]

22:42.962 --> 22:45.998
* Uh, introducing
Mike, Peter, and Jack *

22:46.032 --> 22:48.367
* We're your rhymin' three dads
doing the Mary rap *

22:48.401 --> 22:50.403
* You're just a little lady,
and you need your sleep *

22:50.437 --> 22:52.505
* Don't want to hear no jive
talkin' about something to eat *

22:52.539 --> 22:53.706
* Break down

22:53.740 --> 22:55.842
* Lights out

22:55.875 --> 22:57.577
* Here we go

22:57.610 --> 22:59.712
* We were partying-down,
lady, dancing 'til dawn *

22:59.746 --> 23:01.848
* Till your food-spittin'
toilet-trainin'
changed our song *

23:01.881 --> 23:03.850
* Now we're situated bachelors
and fathers-in-waitin' *

23:03.883 --> 23:06.453
* We'd rather hang with you
than the one he's been dating *

23:06.486 --> 23:09.522
* Say, Mary,
did you wash your face? *

23:09.556 --> 23:10.857
Brrr, yo!

23:10.890 --> 23:14.393
* Say, Mary, did you
brush your teeth? *

23:14.427 --> 23:16.028
Yo!

23:16.062 --> 23:17.730
- * Now, Mike be nimble
- * Peter be quick

23:17.764 --> 23:19.966
* Jack bust a rhyme
and make it slick *

23:19.999 --> 23:22.535
* And to little lady Mary
we say please *

23:22.569 --> 23:24.704
* Just close your eyes
and cop some Z's *

23:24.737 --> 23:26.439
[hooting]

23:26.473 --> 23:28.775
* Just close them eyes
and cop some Z's *

23:28.808 --> 23:30.577
* Wink-a-wink-a-wink a-wink
a-wink-a-wink-a-wink-a-wink *

23:30.610 --> 23:33.045
* Just close them eyes
and cop some Z's *

23:33.079 --> 23:34.881
[hooting]

23:34.914 --> 23:37.917
* Just close them eyes
and cop some Z's *

23:37.950 --> 23:39.151
[hooting]

23:39.185 --> 23:40.987
I need a drink.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.625
Yeah.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.065
Have you seen Jack?

23:53.099 --> 23:55.902
I think he went out
with Cassie.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.772
Damn. He promised
he'd rehearse
this scene with me.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.073
I've got to do it
in class tomorrow.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.142
You know Jack.
He probably forgot.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.511
Yeah.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.080
Sylvia, wait a minute.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.082
I'll do it with you.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.751
You?

24:11.784 --> 24:13.152
Yeah. Sure, why not?

24:13.185 --> 24:15.187
I rehearsed a couple
of times with Jack.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.156
I was a terrific
Lady Macbeth.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.125
What's the play?

24:19.158 --> 24:20.793
Rainmaker.

24:21.894 --> 24:24.130
Well, where do you want me?

24:24.163 --> 24:25.865
All right. Stand here.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.534
Okay.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.768
You're sure?

24:28.801 --> 24:29.936
Yeah, this is great.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.137
Then here.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.605
All right.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.274
Ah, I'm Starbuck?

24:35.307 --> 24:38.010
Unless you want
to play Lizzie.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.847
No.
Starbuck will be fine.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.214
Peter, you should know

24:42.248 --> 24:44.551
Starbuck is a very dynamic,
very passionate,

24:44.584 --> 24:46.553
very charismatic man.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.821
Right.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.657
- You ready?
- Ready.

24:50.690 --> 24:51.824
Okay.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.829
"Let me ask you, Lizzie,
are you pretty?"

24:56.863 --> 24:58.898
What's the matter?

24:58.931 --> 25:01.133
Nothing, nothing. You--

25:01.167 --> 25:03.903
Just be natural. You're
being a little too large.

25:03.936 --> 25:07.640
Okay. Natural.
I can do that.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.141
Natural.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.677
Ahem.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.812
"Let me ask you, Lizzie,
are you pretty?"

25:12.845 --> 25:14.714
No, I'm plain.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.583
"You don't know
you're a woman?"

25:16.616 --> 25:18.751
I am a woman.
A plain one.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.152
"Every woman
is pretty."

25:20.186 --> 25:21.888
Not me.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.090
"Now, close your eyes,
Lizzie.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.825
"Close 'em.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.861
Now say 'I'm pretty'."

25:28.895 --> 25:30.529
I can't.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.164
"Say it.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.666
Say it, Lizzie.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.901
I'm pretty!

25:39.772 --> 25:41.874
What'd you do that for?

25:41.908 --> 25:43.843
It's...

25:43.876 --> 25:45.144
in the script.

25:47.880 --> 25:52.852
Well, no. Actually it says,
"He kisses her."

25:52.885 --> 25:54.721
Right.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.924
Do you want to try it again?

25:57.957 --> 25:59.291
Okay.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.663
- You ready?
- Ready.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.566
Close your eyes.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.703
Say "I'm pretty."

26:10.737 --> 26:12.104
I can't.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.606
Say it, Lizzie.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.107
I'm pretty.

26:28.621 --> 26:31.057
Uh...

26:31.090 --> 26:33.159
Jack
should be doing this.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.662
He's the actor.
I was terrible.

26:35.695 --> 26:36.996
You were doing so well!

26:37.029 --> 26:39.832
I was totally unbelievable.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.969
I thought you were
very believable.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.892
Oh, my God.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.634
I thought this was
against the rules.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.336
No one's home.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.939
Except Mary.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.173
And she's sound asleep.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.775
Look, Laurie,

27:22.809 --> 27:24.443
I've been thinking
about us a lot lately.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.945
- Have you?
- Yeah.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.714
I think that it's...

27:27.747 --> 27:29.682
time for us to...

27:29.716 --> 27:33.285
to fish or cut bait.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.689
All my life, I've dreamt
of a man saying that to me.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.124
I'm sorry.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.326
I don't know
where that came from.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.304
Aah!
There's snakes in my bed!

27:52.338 --> 27:54.741
Ah, Mare! What are you--

27:54.774 --> 27:56.242
You remember my friend
Laurie.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.044
Hi. It's nice
to see you again.

27:58.077 --> 28:01.247
Yeah, we were just, uh,
making, uh, uh...

28:01.280 --> 28:03.983
What were you saying?

28:04.016 --> 28:05.184
Snakes!

28:05.217 --> 28:06.853
Snakes, aha.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.821
There are no snakes
in your bed.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.823
Maybe they were rats.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.892
No rats, either.
I'll be back.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.193
Bye.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.728
Now, you're looking
very tired.

28:15.762 --> 28:16.929
I'm not tired.

28:16.963 --> 28:18.164
You're looking very sleepy.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.331
I'm not sleepy.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.767
You need a rest.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.837
Is everything
all right?

28:24.871 --> 28:26.238
Why do you ask?

28:26.272 --> 28:28.274
You seem tense.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.375
I don't know.

28:31.477 --> 28:34.947
Sometimes I feel like my life
is one long improvisation.

28:34.981 --> 28:38.017
I don't have time to think,
plan, or take it in.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.753
Things are thrown at me,
and I react.

28:40.787 --> 28:43.122
I keep asking myself
"Am I a good mother?

28:43.155 --> 28:45.057
Am I doing the right things
for Mary?"

28:45.091 --> 28:47.526
Every mother
asks herself that.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.096
- Did you?
- Constantly.

28:50.129 --> 28:53.332
- Really?
- You're a wonderful mother.

28:55.101 --> 28:58.204
All you need now
is a husband.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.740
Romance is the last thing
on my mind right now.

29:01.774 --> 29:04.877
I'm not talking
about romance, darling.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.079
I'm talking
about marriage.

29:07.113 --> 29:10.282
What's happening
between you and Edward?

29:12.118 --> 29:14.053
He proposed to me.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.955
And?

29:17.189 --> 29:19.258
Edward is a wonderful man.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.128
In some ways
I love him very much.

29:22.161 --> 29:25.998
But something keeps me
from saying yes.

29:26.032 --> 29:30.302
Would that something happen
to be a tall architect?

29:30.336 --> 29:31.804
What do you mean?

29:31.838 --> 29:34.073
I hate to be the one
to tell you,

29:34.106 --> 29:36.108
but you're wasting
your time with that one.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.977
Why do you say that?

29:38.010 --> 29:40.512
Because some men
are never comfortable

29:40.546 --> 29:41.981
with their feelings.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.415
They can't open up.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.318
But he does with Mary.
He's wonderful with her.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.454
That's different.

29:48.487 --> 29:52.191
If you think that you can
get him to open up to you,

29:52.224 --> 29:55.594
then by all means
marry him.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.097
I'm afraid
you're going to find

29:58.130 --> 30:00.099
you've wasted
a lot of precious time

30:00.132 --> 30:02.368
waiting for nothing.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.209
Woman on TV:
That's Alberta.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.344
[laughter]

30:12.378 --> 30:14.280
Mary, I told you

30:14.313 --> 30:16.315
to turn off
the television
and go to sleep.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.150
- No!
- Michael: Mary!

30:18.184 --> 30:20.286
We leave her with you
for a couple of hours,

30:20.319 --> 30:22.021
- and she's crazy, Michael.
- Don't blame me.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.289
She's going through
some weird phase.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.957
It's no different
than before.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.859
It's a lot different,
I'm telling you.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.460
Things have got to change
around here.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.829
I heard you. Give me
that remote control.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.199
It's not healthy
for a guy to get excited
and have to stop!

30:33.232 --> 30:34.901
It's bad for my heart.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.969
She wouldn't stop
bothering us all night.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.304
Laurie finally left.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.206
Don't ever let me
loose in a jungle.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.974
That's it.
I'm pulling the plug.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.475
I'll probably never
see her again.

30:43.509 --> 30:46.178
I've got a life, too,
you know!

30:46.212 --> 30:48.414
- Shit!
- You said the "S" word.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.182
No, I didn't. Ah, shit!

30:50.216 --> 30:51.984
Pete, are you
listening to me?

30:52.018 --> 30:53.886
No, I'm electrocuting myself.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.222
Sylvia:
What is going on here?

30:56.255 --> 30:59.191
What are you doing up
at this late hour,
young lady?

30:59.225 --> 31:01.193
Excuse us.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.100
What started all this?

31:08.134 --> 31:11.537
I think we're getting into
some uncharted territory here.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.611
I want to talk to her
about us

31:19.645 --> 31:21.513
and what we can do
when I'm with Laurie.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.549
You're kidding.
Laurie was here?

31:23.582 --> 31:26.118
[chatter]

31:28.587 --> 31:30.256
[Jack, Peter laugh]

31:32.258 --> 31:33.625
Is it mine or yours?

31:33.659 --> 31:35.194
It's me. It's me.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.363
I'll take that one.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.931
How's Mary?

31:38.965 --> 31:40.199
Asleep for now.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.201
What's the matter
with her?

31:42.234 --> 31:45.204
I think we're getting a taste
of some tough things ahead,

31:45.237 --> 31:46.405
like school.

31:46.438 --> 31:47.606
Ha! Adolescence!

31:47.639 --> 31:49.041
Puberty.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.542
Puberty was
my favorite stage.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.044
I'm serious, Jack.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.980
So am I. [laughing]

31:54.013 --> 31:55.481
That's one thing
I was really good at.

31:55.514 --> 31:56.715
[laughing]

31:56.748 --> 31:58.117
How long do you think

31:58.150 --> 31:59.618
we're going to be
able to do this?

31:59.651 --> 32:01.053
Do what, honey?

32:01.087 --> 32:02.388
Live like this.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.156
Me, you, Mary.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.560
Well, it's worked so far,
hasn't it?

32:08.594 --> 32:10.997
Because it was
necessary at first.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.331
Oh, I see.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.266
And now you're
such a big star,

32:14.300 --> 32:15.968
you don't need
the rest of us.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.403
That's not true, Jack.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.238
I just don't think
that we are meeting

32:19.271 --> 32:22.408
all of Mary's
or my or your needs.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.610
Jack:
What needs are you
talking about?

32:24.643 --> 32:30.116
Passion, marriage,
children, sex.

32:30.149 --> 32:32.084
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.619
I'll talk to Mary
about sex if you want.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.021
No.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.989
Not sex for Mary,
sex for me.

32:37.023 --> 32:39.525
Uh-oh. Time to dust off
the old penis speech.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.460
I never have it with me
when I need it.

32:41.493 --> 32:42.961
- How's that go?
- I'm serious!

32:42.995 --> 32:44.496
I want to get married.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.598
I want to have
more children.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.268
What about you?
This must be very
limiting for you.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.470
It is.
That's the problem.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.772
Just think. If Mary and I
hadn't moved in here

32:53.805 --> 32:55.674
and taken up your lives
like this,

32:55.707 --> 32:57.443
you'd be in different
places by now.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.311
- We'd be married.
- We'd be divorced.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.213
You saved us a fortune.

33:01.247 --> 33:03.015
You can joke
all you want,

33:03.049 --> 33:04.450
but the bottom line is

33:04.483 --> 33:06.652
Mary needs a more
normal environment.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.387
She's very confused
right now,

33:08.420 --> 33:10.489
and to be honest,
so am I.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.297
All right.

33:18.330 --> 33:23.035
Okay, I'll live up
to my responsibility.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.636
You want to marry me?

33:24.670 --> 33:27.206
Jack, be serious.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.540
I am being serious.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.309
We had a child together,
for goodness' sake.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.244
What do you say?

33:34.046 --> 33:35.581
Want to sleep on it?

33:35.614 --> 33:37.416
She did that once
before, Jack.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.717
Hey, shut up.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.523
Do you want to marry me?

33:48.094 --> 33:49.495
No.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.230
No?

33:51.263 --> 33:53.299
But thank you for asking.

33:54.433 --> 33:57.336
Whew!
That was a close one.

33:57.369 --> 34:00.739
Jack, you're a wonderful man
and a great father,

34:00.772 --> 34:02.608
but you'd be
a terrible husband.

34:02.641 --> 34:04.343
I can live with that.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.378
Besides, I don't love you.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.779
Not romantically.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.181
You don't love me, either,
not like that.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.550
How do you know
I don't?

34:11.583 --> 34:13.219
- I know.
- Maybe he does.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.254
No, he can't fool me.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.188
He's not
that good an actor.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.389
I know you too well.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.426
- I could fool you.
- Never!

34:20.458 --> 34:21.726
What? Is it my hands?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.462
I never know what to do
with my hands.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.197
My hands are always
giving me away.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.632
Look...

34:26.665 --> 34:28.367
I didn't come down here

34:28.400 --> 34:31.469
expecting the three of you
to draw straws for me.

34:31.503 --> 34:34.273
I'm just telling you
that a lot of things
are changing,

34:34.306 --> 34:36.408
and I think
it's time we face it.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.425
[knock on door]

34:53.458 --> 34:54.659
Come in.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.797
Oh, Peter!
Is Mary all right?

34:58.830 --> 35:00.632
She's fine.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.568
Last time you came
to the theater,

35:02.601 --> 35:04.403
she had a raisin
in her ear.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.438
That was Jack who put
the raisin in her ear.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.240
Mm, I should've known.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.842
That's a very
pretty dress.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.578
Thank you.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.846
So what brings you here?

35:14.880 --> 35:16.282
You.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.616
Me?

35:17.649 --> 35:19.618
Yeah. I was thinking
about what you said.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.453
And you're right.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.655
We haven't been paying enough
attention to your needs.

35:23.689 --> 35:27.193
There's something that I
wanted to say to you,

35:27.226 --> 35:30.496
um, without Michael
and Jack around.

35:34.233 --> 35:37.203
What is it?

35:37.236 --> 35:40.672
Well, I think
you should get married

35:40.706 --> 35:42.541
and have more kids.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.142
If they're anything
like Mary,

35:44.176 --> 35:46.678
I think you should
have a dozen more.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.680
I just wanted you
to know that.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.650
And I wanted you to know

35:51.683 --> 35:53.585
that whatever you decide,
I'll support you.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.154
Is that all?

35:57.723 --> 36:00.726
Well, make sure
you pick the right guy.

36:00.759 --> 36:03.462
Don't just rush into it.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.298
I'm not rushing into anything.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.700
That's what everybody thinks
when they're doing it.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.502
This is a huge step.

36:10.536 --> 36:12.538
Maybe it's time
we take some huge steps.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.406
Picking the wrong person
to marry

36:14.440 --> 36:16.208
is the worst mistake
you can make.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.509
Believe me, I know.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.345
Do you? How many times
have you been married?

36:19.378 --> 36:20.912
Once.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.548
What?

36:24.550 --> 36:25.751
When?

36:25.784 --> 36:28.254
We've spent
all this time together,

36:28.287 --> 36:29.488
and you've never told me?

36:29.521 --> 36:31.923
Well,
it was a long time ago...

36:31.957 --> 36:34.526
for about an hour.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.262
Do Jack and Michael know?

36:36.295 --> 36:37.663
Jack knows.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.197
No one else?

36:39.231 --> 36:42.501
My ex-wife has a dim
recollection.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.437
Obviously it was a wonderful
experience for you.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.441
One that can never
be equaled--

36:49.475 --> 36:51.343
not without bloodshed,
anyway.

36:51.377 --> 36:52.544
Look--

36:52.578 --> 36:54.012
So you ready,
darling?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.581
Oh.
I'm sorry, Peter.

36:55.614 --> 36:56.915
I didn't know
you were here.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.350
Hello, darling.

36:58.384 --> 37:03.555
I was...
just leaving, Edward.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.363
Think about it.

37:11.397 --> 37:12.731
I will.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.871
We can't force Sylvia to marry
somebody we choose for her.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.907
All we're saying is that she
wants to get married.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.709
That's a given.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.577
So let's introduce her
to some nice guys,

37:25.611 --> 37:27.479
let nature take its course.

37:27.513 --> 37:28.880
Look, Peter, if it's
a friend of ours,

37:28.914 --> 37:30.616
it'll make things
easier on us.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.384
That's true.

37:32.418 --> 37:33.885
Good. Read the list.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.721
Okay. Carl?

37:35.754 --> 37:37.589
Carl is too short.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.458
But he won't be
a threat to Mary.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.293
Because she's bigger
than he is.

37:41.327 --> 37:42.561
What about Bill?

37:42.594 --> 37:43.795
I like Bill.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.263
So do I,
but don't you think

37:45.297 --> 37:46.598
we need someone
a little more elegant?

37:46.632 --> 37:49.067
Moose?
No. Probably not.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.437
- Denny.
- Denny's a great idea.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.771
Denny's always broke.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.806
- What about Jim?
- Jim?

37:54.840 --> 37:57.776
Someone a little more mature
than Mary would be preferable.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.478
These are slim pickings.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.680
I'm glad I'm not a lady
searching for a husband.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.415
I'm looking better
all the time.

38:03.449 --> 38:04.783
- Greg?
- Too young.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.452
- Matt?
- Too old.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.420
- Trevor?
- Too fat.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.622
Bill? Billy-Bob?
Billy-Joe?

38:10.656 --> 38:13.325
Peter, we're not asking
you to marry the guy.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.293
What about Edward?

38:15.327 --> 38:17.028
He's English.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.997
So is Sylvia.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.600
Nah, that's one of those
actor-director things.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.969
They never last.
Trust me. [slurp]

38:24.002 --> 38:25.637
["Dancing In the Dark" plays]

38:25.671 --> 38:27.639
You know what I'm thinking?

38:27.673 --> 38:29.875
What?

38:29.908 --> 38:32.778
I'm thinking I'd like
to have another child.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.781
Maybe two more.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.484
Maybe even a dozen.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.588
I'd like to have children.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.524
Really?

38:45.557 --> 38:46.958
You didn't before.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.660
I must be growing up.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.396
No, no, no,
I thought you liked

38:50.429 --> 38:52.531
all those opening night
parties.

38:52.564 --> 38:54.032
The hotels, the stars.

38:54.065 --> 38:55.501
I thought that was
the best part.

38:55.534 --> 38:58.003
I lied.
You're the best part.

38:58.036 --> 39:01.006
I love you,
Sylvia Bennington.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.674
Marry me.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.548
I'm getting married.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.016
I'm getting married.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.351
I'm, I'm...

39:13.385 --> 39:14.753
I'm getting married.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.390
Ah, no!

39:18.424 --> 39:20.426
Uh, Sylvia,
there's no more milk.

39:20.459 --> 39:21.660
I'm getting married.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.529
Don't overreact.
I can get some milk.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.564
Jack, I think she's serious.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.699
- You serious?
- I'm very serious.

39:27.733 --> 39:30.536
- You're getting married?
- Yes.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.571
To someone specific?

39:32.604 --> 39:34.940
No, to the Mormon
Tabernacle Choir.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.575
Jack:
We spent all night at it

39:36.608 --> 39:37.843
and couldn't come up
with squat.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.678
What do you mean?

39:39.711 --> 39:41.780
Uh, never mind.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.682
Who is he?

39:43.715 --> 39:45.784
- Edward.
- Yes.

39:45.817 --> 39:49.688
But, sweetheart, come on,
he's a director.

39:49.721 --> 39:50.956
Why him?

39:50.989 --> 39:52.858
Because he asked me

39:52.891 --> 39:55.527
and because I love him.

39:55.561 --> 39:57.062
I've got so much to do.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.964
We're being married
in England.

39:58.997 --> 40:01.433
- Michael: When?
- As soon as possible.

40:01.467 --> 40:03.068
Edward's directing a production

40:03.101 --> 40:04.870
of Midsummer Night's Dream,
at the National,

40:04.903 --> 40:06.638
and I'll be doing it
with him.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.039
Anything in it for me?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.475
Jack, come on.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.978
Aren't you happy for me?

40:13.011 --> 40:15.481
Yeah, yeah,
of course we are.

40:15.514 --> 40:16.948
Michael:
Of course. Thrilled.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.950
How many times does
a lady get married, huh?

40:18.984 --> 40:21.086
Two, three times
at the most?

40:21.119 --> 40:22.821
Just once for me, thank you.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.122
Where are you going
to live?

40:25.991 --> 40:27.793
London.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.661
London, England?

40:29.695 --> 40:31.162
No, London, New Jersey.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.098
And Mary?

40:35.100 --> 40:37.002
I'm taking Mary with me.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.479
Mommy, I can't find Sabrina!

40:47.513 --> 40:50.181
I'll be right there,
darling.

40:50.215 --> 40:53.652
Look,
I know this is sudden.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.954
It's not easy for me,
either.

40:55.987 --> 41:00.759
I love you all
very, very much.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.194
I'm counting on you.

41:03.228 --> 41:06.665
I really need
your understanding, so--

41:06.698 --> 41:09.100
I really think it's
the best thing for everyone,

41:09.134 --> 41:11.503
so try and support me
in this, will you?

41:29.888 --> 41:32.624
Mary: I don't want
to go to England.

41:32.658 --> 41:35.961
Yeah, I know, but sometimes
we gotta do things

41:35.994 --> 41:37.829
that seem kinda hard at first,

41:37.863 --> 41:40.065
and most of the time
they turn out to be great

41:40.098 --> 41:41.499
after all, you know?

41:41.533 --> 41:42.801
No, they don't.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.570
Oh, sure, they do.
Like you.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.071
What do you mean?

41:46.104 --> 41:48.640
Well, when you first
showed up,

41:48.674 --> 41:51.209
we weren't sure we were
gonna like you at all.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.711
Why not?

41:52.744 --> 41:55.313
Because all you did
was eat and sleep and...

41:55.346 --> 41:57.549
cry at--

41:57.583 --> 41:59.851
Well, look how great
it turned out. Here.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.823
But I'll never see you again.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.057
Of course you will.

42:06.091 --> 42:08.226
We'll come visit you,
and you can visit us.

42:08.259 --> 42:09.995
Not every day.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.263
No, not every day.

42:12.297 --> 42:14.099
Okay. I'll tell you what.

42:14.132 --> 42:15.601
Close your eyes.

42:15.634 --> 42:16.935
I don't want to.

42:16.968 --> 42:18.870
Come on, close your eyes.
Are you cheating?

42:18.904 --> 42:20.672
Are they closed?

42:20.706 --> 42:22.340
Okay.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.875
Can you see us?

42:23.909 --> 42:25.176
No.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.878
Well, then you're not
looking hard enough.

42:26.912 --> 42:31.549
Look real hard,
way in the back there.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.719
Can you see us now?

42:35.153 --> 42:37.222
Yeah, I can see you.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.691
There you go.
What are we doing?

42:39.725 --> 42:41.760
Michael's drawing.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.561
Yeah?
What's Jack doing?

42:43.595 --> 42:45.697
Jack's looking in the mirror.

42:45.731 --> 42:49.234
And you are watching
basketball on TV,

42:49.267 --> 42:52.704
yelling at Jack for not
cleaning up the kitchen.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.606
Well, see?

42:54.640 --> 42:56.107
That sounds about right
to me,

42:56.141 --> 42:58.143
so that's all you got to do.
Whenever you need us,

42:58.176 --> 43:00.145
you just close your eyes
real tight,

43:00.178 --> 43:01.880
you look for us,

43:01.913 --> 43:04.582
and we'll be right there
with you.

43:06.084 --> 43:07.585
Sit on my lap.

43:20.666 --> 43:23.068
Now, remember,
don't open it

43:23.101 --> 43:25.403
unless you're prepared
to love and care
for what's in it.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.972
What is it?

43:27.005 --> 43:28.774
You won't know
till you open it.

43:28.807 --> 43:30.642
You're wonderful
with her.

43:30.676 --> 43:32.243
Broadway's nothing
compared to children,

43:32.277 --> 43:33.845
the toughest audience
in the world.

43:33.879 --> 43:35.814
Glad you could come,
Edward.

43:35.847 --> 43:37.082
Good to see you, Peter.

43:37.115 --> 43:38.917
- Michael.
- Hey, there.

43:38.950 --> 43:41.787
I adored your cartoon
this morning.

43:41.820 --> 43:43.955
What astonishes me

43:43.989 --> 43:45.691
is the way a satirist
like yourself

43:45.724 --> 43:46.992
can draw in one frame

43:47.025 --> 43:48.794
what it takes us
two or three hours

43:48.827 --> 43:50.095
in a play to accomplish.

43:50.128 --> 43:51.663
I like to think

43:51.697 --> 43:53.298
I touch upon the deeper
issues of society.

43:53.331 --> 43:56.034
And Jack!
Jack, how are you?

43:56.067 --> 43:57.869
Well, unemployed.

43:57.903 --> 44:00.438
I've always meant to explain
why I didn't cast you

44:00.471 --> 44:01.973
when you auditioned
for me.

44:02.007 --> 44:04.142
You don't have--
It's all right.

44:04.175 --> 44:05.711
Why didn't you?

44:05.744 --> 44:07.178
No, that's all right.

44:07.212 --> 44:09.881
Well, I realized
that Jack is far too...

44:09.915 --> 44:11.649
large an actor
for that part.

44:11.683 --> 44:13.151
You see,
your comic expertise

44:13.184 --> 44:15.186
would've thrown the whole
play out of balance.

44:15.220 --> 44:17.288
I loved your last
commercial,

44:17.322 --> 44:18.724
by the way.
Fabulous.

44:18.757 --> 44:20.058
Oh, yeah.
The laxative one?

44:20.091 --> 44:21.392
You were hysterical.

44:21.426 --> 44:23.995
I don't want to sound
conceited or anything,

44:24.029 --> 44:25.897
but a lot of people say
that when they watched,

44:25.931 --> 44:28.867
they really believed
that I was constipated.

44:28.900 --> 44:30.668
As I did, truly.

44:31.870 --> 44:33.071
Hey, thanks.

44:33.104 --> 44:35.006
That means a lot to me.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.008
I think we need drinks.

44:39.344 --> 44:41.412
I think we need shovels.

44:44.850 --> 44:48.720
[laughing]

44:48.754 --> 44:50.355
Oh, this is crazy.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.824
All I'm doing is
talking about myself.

44:52.858 --> 44:54.492
Can I fill your drink
up for you, Ed?

44:54.525 --> 44:56.227
You don't mind if I
call you Ed, do you?

44:56.261 --> 44:57.395
Not at all.

44:58.930 --> 45:00.832
I opened my present!

45:00.866 --> 45:02.267
You did? What is it?

45:02.300 --> 45:03.769
A picture of a horse.

45:03.802 --> 45:05.370
You've got to love
and care for that horse.

45:05.403 --> 45:06.872
But it's
only a picture.

45:06.905 --> 45:08.706
That's my kind of horse.

45:08.740 --> 45:10.208
Here
it's only a picture,

45:10.241 --> 45:12.077
but back home in England,
it's a real horse.

45:12.110 --> 45:13.344
It is?

45:13.378 --> 45:15.713
You got her a real horse?

45:15.747 --> 45:17.415
Thank Edward.

45:19.084 --> 45:21.219
Thank you, Edward.
[Sylvia chuckles]

45:21.252 --> 45:23.789
Jack, Edward
gave me a horse.

45:23.822 --> 45:26.124
You made her day,
her year.

45:26.157 --> 45:28.960
Edward,
it can be dangerous

45:28.994 --> 45:31.029
to bargain for a child's
affection.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.764
I'm sorry?

45:32.798 --> 45:35.901
Would anyone like some of my
liver mousse hors d'oeuvres?

45:35.934 --> 45:37.302
You buy her a horse.

45:37.335 --> 45:39.871
What's next?
Two horses?

45:39.905 --> 45:41.306
Three horses?

45:41.339 --> 45:43.942
They're made from fresh
goat liver, Peter.

45:43.975 --> 45:46.377
And then what?
A motorcycle, a car?

45:46.411 --> 45:48.379
Pete, try one of these.
Put one in your mouth.

45:48.413 --> 45:50.115
No, thank you.
Where does it end?

45:50.148 --> 45:51.783
I see your point.

45:54.419 --> 45:57.088
You've never been around
a kid before, have you?

45:57.122 --> 45:59.390
No. Much like yourself,

45:59.424 --> 46:01.059
I've never had
a child of my own.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.929
Raising a child is not
as easy as it looks.

46:03.962 --> 46:05.396
It doesn't look easy
at all.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.065
It isn't.

46:07.098 --> 46:09.567
They see through people
much quicker than adults do.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.937
I think we should eat.

46:18.443 --> 46:20.145
I'm sorry about Peter.

46:20.178 --> 46:22.113
I don't know what he
thought he was doing.

46:22.147 --> 46:23.448
I can handle him.

46:37.128 --> 46:40.165
My favorite was when he
said he really thought

46:40.198 --> 46:42.333
Jack was constipated
in that commercial.

46:42.367 --> 46:44.135
- You believe he said that?
- What a crock.

46:44.169 --> 46:46.872
Are you saying you didn't
think that I was constipated?

46:46.905 --> 46:48.840
- Is that what you're saying.
- No.

46:48.874 --> 46:50.341
- Is that what you're saying?
- Don't take it personally.

46:50.375 --> 46:52.143
What do you know about acting?

46:52.177 --> 46:54.512
I know how to do this.
Let's see you act constipated.

46:54.545 --> 46:56.281
Go on, act constipated.

46:56.314 --> 46:59.985
Peter, what you did today
was totally uncalled-for.

47:02.220 --> 47:03.454
What did I do?

47:03.488 --> 47:04.856
Don't give me that.

47:04.890 --> 47:06.291
You acted
like a spoiled child.

47:06.324 --> 47:09.027
Well, I don't like the guy.

47:09.060 --> 47:10.628
You never gave him
a chance.

47:10.661 --> 47:12.530
He's not the right
father for Mary.

47:12.563 --> 47:14.966
Well, no one supposes
for a moment

47:15.000 --> 47:17.135
that he's
as perfect as you are.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.370
I'm only thinking of Mary.

47:19.404 --> 47:20.571
No, you're not!

47:20.605 --> 47:22.473
You're only thinking
of yourself,

47:22.507 --> 47:24.542
how you're
going to miss Mary,

47:24.575 --> 47:26.311
how it'll upset your life,

47:26.344 --> 47:28.479
how someone else will be
with her when you're not.

47:28.513 --> 47:31.316
You haven't once thought
of what she or I need!

47:31.349 --> 47:32.517
That's not true.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.986
Do you know how hard
today was for me?

47:35.020 --> 47:37.055
Let me tell you
it was very hard.

47:37.088 --> 47:39.490
All I needed was a little
support from you.

47:39.524 --> 47:43.528
And instead all I got
was a hearty helping
of your bruised ego.

47:43.561 --> 47:45.596
You are a selfish bastard!

47:45.630 --> 47:47.232
I'm selfish?

47:47.265 --> 47:49.167
I didn't leave my baby
on a doorstep

47:49.200 --> 47:50.435
when she was 6 months old.

48:00.946 --> 48:02.113
[door slams]

48:13.258 --> 48:15.226
They're really starting
to hate each other.

48:15.260 --> 48:17.028
Ah, don't kid yourself.

48:17.062 --> 48:19.564
I still love
the first woman who hit me.

48:25.636 --> 48:28.039
Do you remember
the day I got Sabrina

48:28.073 --> 48:29.707
and you left her on the bus?

48:29.740 --> 48:31.409
Remember that?

48:31.442 --> 48:34.212
Do you remember the day
she fell in the pond

48:34.245 --> 48:36.047
in Central Park?

48:36.081 --> 48:37.915
You dropped her
in the pond

48:37.949 --> 48:39.650
when you were smiling
at that lady.

48:39.684 --> 48:41.152
I did?

48:41.186 --> 48:43.088
Oh, right. Yes, I did.

48:43.121 --> 48:44.422
I forgot that.

48:44.455 --> 48:47.258
Anyway, see, me
and Sabrina have this--

48:47.292 --> 48:48.926
well,
we have a connection.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.997
So when you're
in England with Sabrina,

48:52.030 --> 48:53.564
it'll be like--

48:53.598 --> 48:55.400
like you're
there with me.

48:55.433 --> 48:57.102
Deal?

48:57.135 --> 48:59.504
Will you miss me?

48:59.537 --> 49:02.173
Will I miss you?

49:02.207 --> 49:03.508
Mary, I love you.

49:05.543 --> 49:07.478
You're
the most perfect thing

49:07.512 --> 49:09.747
I've ever done
in my entire life.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.182
What do you mean?

49:11.216 --> 49:13.251
Someday I'll explain
that to you,

49:13.284 --> 49:15.086
but right now, I think
you should go back to bed.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.287
Okay?

49:19.057 --> 49:20.625
I'll see you later.

49:43.181 --> 49:44.682
Well.

49:44.715 --> 49:46.284
There, sweetie.

49:46.317 --> 49:48.519
Mmm. I'm gonna miss you.

49:48.553 --> 49:51.289
I'm going
to miss you, too.

49:51.322 --> 49:52.990
Okay, sweetie.

49:55.593 --> 49:59.530
Okay, now, you be
a strong little girl,

49:59.564 --> 50:02.467
and you help
your mother, right?

50:02.500 --> 50:04.001
I will.

50:08.073 --> 50:09.340
Okay.

50:12.777 --> 50:14.579
[engine starts]

50:15.680 --> 50:17.148
Call when you get there.

50:17.182 --> 50:18.283
We will.

50:52.883 --> 50:54.352
You going to the wedding?

50:54.385 --> 50:55.553
Nope.

50:57.555 --> 50:58.723
You?

50:58.756 --> 51:01.726
No. I got deadlines.

51:03.228 --> 51:04.695
You?

51:04.729 --> 51:07.798
No, I have that
TV movie in Brazil.

51:07.832 --> 51:10.635
Besides, I don't think I could
watch Sylvia get married.

51:10.668 --> 51:12.770
It'd be like watching
our family end.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.112
Let's have a party.

51:22.647 --> 51:24.382
Yeah? What kind of party?

51:24.415 --> 51:27.285
The kind we used
to throw all the time.

51:27.318 --> 51:29.220
I like that idea.

51:29.254 --> 51:31.622
We could even have it
on a school night.

51:31.656 --> 51:35.260
Yeah! It'd be kind of like
our return to bachelorhood.

51:35.293 --> 51:36.661
[dance music playing]

51:36.694 --> 51:37.895
Enough for you?

51:37.928 --> 51:39.264
Yeah, that's great.

51:46.871 --> 51:48.639
- Hey!
- Hi, how are you?

51:48.673 --> 51:50.275
- Fine, thanks.
- Is this fun or what?

51:50.308 --> 51:51.576
Yeah.

51:51.609 --> 51:53.744
We gotta make up
for lost time, fellas.

51:53.778 --> 51:56.447
Tell you what. Why don't I
take the blondes?

51:56.481 --> 51:58.249
I'll take the brunettes.

51:58.283 --> 52:00.851
I guess that leaves me
the redheads.

52:00.885 --> 52:02.320
[chatter]

52:02.353 --> 52:04.755
Excuse me.
Would you like to dance?

52:04.789 --> 52:06.457
- Sure.
- I got to warn you.

52:06.491 --> 52:08.459
You're gonna have
to keep up with me.

52:08.493 --> 52:10.361
- I'm one hell of a dancer.
- Oh!

52:17.235 --> 52:18.436
[rip]

52:18.469 --> 52:19.604
Aah!

52:19.637 --> 52:20.938
Are you okay?

52:20.971 --> 52:24.175
Oh, don't worry.
Look.

52:24.209 --> 52:28.779
Look. Every picture,
she gets cuter and cuter.

52:28.813 --> 52:31.148
Did I tell you
what Mary said last year?

52:31.182 --> 52:32.650
Only until May.

52:32.683 --> 52:34.285
I'm gonna get a drink,

52:34.319 --> 52:37.154
then we can start
on what she said in June.

52:40.725 --> 52:42.393
I did some
of the work myself.

52:42.427 --> 52:43.628
I got all the furniture--

52:43.661 --> 52:45.630
This bookcase
is from a farm.

52:45.663 --> 52:47.532
Where?

52:47.565 --> 52:48.866
What did you say
your name was?

52:48.899 --> 52:50.368
- Allisia.
- I'm Peter.

52:50.401 --> 52:51.902
The farm was in Vermont.

52:51.936 --> 52:53.371
It's old,
from the 18th century.

52:53.404 --> 52:54.672
I like it.

52:54.705 --> 52:56.507
When are you gonna
paint it?

52:56.541 --> 52:57.875
[new song starts]

52:57.908 --> 52:59.244
Wanna dance?

you're the one *

53:06.217 --> 53:08.653
* You make bath time
lots of fun *

53:08.686 --> 53:10.555
* Rubber Duckie,
I'm awfully fond of you *

* Rubber Duckie,
joy of joys *

53:16.861 --> 53:18.529
[squeak squeak]

53:18.563 --> 53:21.232
* When I squeeze you,
you make noise *

53:21.266 --> 53:26.604
* Rubber Duckie,
I'm awfully fond of you *

53:28.406 --> 53:30.207
[clock ticks]

53:41.819 --> 53:43.321
Ahem.

53:46.657 --> 53:48.259
Here it is.

53:48.293 --> 53:49.760
My speciality:

53:49.794 --> 53:52.229
liver mousse
and poached eggs.

53:56.267 --> 53:57.768
An attractive combination.

53:57.802 --> 53:59.570
It's great.

53:59.604 --> 54:01.238
Don't you like it?

54:01.272 --> 54:02.707
I love it,

54:02.740 --> 54:05.376
but we do have a cook
for this sort of thing.

54:05.410 --> 54:06.744
I like doing it.

54:06.777 --> 54:09.814
Try it, Edward.
You'll like it.

54:09.847 --> 54:13.518
Whoever taught you to hold
your teacup like that?

54:21.426 --> 54:22.993
I don't know anybody here.

54:23.027 --> 54:25.262
I thought
Glenn was coming.

54:25.296 --> 54:27.064
His kids have measles.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.733
What about Martha?

54:28.766 --> 54:31.402
She had to make
an asparagus costume
for Tommy.

54:31.436 --> 54:33.938
So much for life
in the fast lane.

54:33.971 --> 54:35.473
What are we doing here?

54:35.506 --> 54:37.675
Having a great time.
Can't you tell?

54:37.708 --> 54:39.310
Why aren't we in England?

54:39.344 --> 54:41.346
Ah, Michael, come on.

54:41.379 --> 54:43.648
I'm telling you,
I spoke to Mary yesterday.

54:43.681 --> 54:45.350
I could sense
she was not happy.

54:45.383 --> 54:47.485
She said she was
having a good time.

54:47.518 --> 54:49.620
I know what I'm talking about.

54:49.654 --> 54:52.357
My parents used to send me
off to camp every summer.

54:52.390 --> 54:54.992
The counselors would make us
write postcards home.

54:55.025 --> 54:57.428
I'd be covered
in poison ivy,

54:57.462 --> 54:59.830
sharing a cabin with
a guy who collected farts,

54:59.864 --> 55:02.333
and I'd be praying
that the whole place

55:02.367 --> 55:04.034
would burn to the ground.

55:04.068 --> 55:06.804
But I'd always write what
a good time I was having.

55:09.374 --> 55:10.941
Believe me, you guys,

55:10.975 --> 55:13.378
our little girl is miserable.

55:14.679 --> 55:16.481
And I'm going to England.

55:16.514 --> 55:18.649
You guys can stay here
if you like.

55:18.683 --> 55:20.451
I'm going.

55:20.485 --> 55:21.819
[thunder]

55:24.088 --> 55:26.591
["Rue Britannia"]

55:35.933 --> 55:38.403
Peter: What's this thing
run on, batteries?

55:38.436 --> 55:39.870
The last one they had.

55:39.904 --> 55:41.706
[motor grinds]

55:50.080 --> 55:51.982
I hate England.
I always have.

55:52.016 --> 55:54.051
Pete, as long as we're here,
look on the bright side.

55:54.084 --> 55:55.820
Okay, okay.
You're right. I'm sorry.

55:55.853 --> 55:57.354
Hmm.

55:57.388 --> 55:59.657
The toilet paper's
like Reynolds Wrap.

55:59.690 --> 56:00.991
That's a start.

56:01.025 --> 56:02.660
It's so damn cold
all the time,

56:02.693 --> 56:04.429
the only thing
that's warm is the ice.

56:04.462 --> 56:05.930
- You know what I hate most?
- What?

56:05.963 --> 56:07.532
The way they use words
like "shedule."

56:07.565 --> 56:09.567
- And "vit-amins."
- Yeah.

56:12.036 --> 56:13.504
[honk]

56:13.538 --> 56:15.706
- Other side, Pete!
- Damn!

56:15.740 --> 56:17.742
- Want me to drive?
- Relax.

56:17.775 --> 56:19.610
I'm telling you,
we're lost.

56:19.644 --> 56:21.011
I haven't seen a road
that's marked

56:21.045 --> 56:22.547
in this map
in 20 minutes.

56:22.580 --> 56:23.848
[sheep bleating]

56:23.881 --> 56:25.082
What's that noise?

56:25.115 --> 56:26.784
Do you think
it's the engine?

56:26.817 --> 56:27.985
Uh-uh.

56:34.892 --> 56:37.394
The next road
that you come to--

56:37.428 --> 56:39.697
I can't hear a word
he's saying.

56:39.730 --> 56:40.965
[bleating]

56:40.998 --> 56:42.800
[Man continues
inaudibly]

56:47.104 --> 56:48.539
I got it, I got it.

56:48.573 --> 56:50.040
On your right,

56:50.074 --> 56:53.110
you'll see two large trees
and a gray stone,

56:53.143 --> 56:57.782
which my wife says
reminds her of a tortoise.

56:57.815 --> 57:02.553
Now, in between those trees
is a long, narrow road

57:02.587 --> 57:05.723
with a shallow brook
running alongside

57:05.756 --> 57:09.627
and a short hedge
full of white blossoms.

57:09.660 --> 57:12.863
Now, don't take that road!

57:15.032 --> 57:16.734
Here we go,
you sheep.

57:16.767 --> 57:19.504
Let's get out of here
as fast as we possibly can.

57:20.671 --> 57:21.806
[engine sputters]

57:36.120 --> 57:37.788
Maybe we should have
called first.

57:37.822 --> 57:39.189
Nah.
Don't worry about it.

57:39.223 --> 57:40.725
This'll be more fun.

57:41.959 --> 57:43.127
Thank you.

57:49.066 --> 57:50.835
[chatter]

57:59.977 --> 58:01.979
Peter: This is it?

58:02.012 --> 58:03.480
It's so huge.

58:03.514 --> 58:04.982
Looks like a hotel.

58:10.521 --> 58:13.223
Wow, look at this place.

58:13.257 --> 58:14.959
Family money.

58:14.992 --> 58:17.828
Yeah. Hmm.

58:17.862 --> 58:19.229
Hey.

58:19.263 --> 58:21.799
The Medieval version
of permanent press.

58:21.832 --> 58:23.868
How do you take a leak
in one of these things?

58:23.901 --> 58:26.837
Carefully,
very carefully.

58:37.682 --> 58:39.016
Come on.

58:44.689 --> 58:46.056
There she is!

58:47.892 --> 58:50.561
Look, it's Michael and Peter!

58:53.230 --> 58:55.265
My life is complete.

58:57.868 --> 58:59.970
- Yay!
- Yeah!

59:03.140 --> 59:05.275
- We missed you!
- Missed you more.

59:08.979 --> 59:10.347
Welcome.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.116
It's good of you
to come.

59:12.149 --> 59:14.551
- Edward.
- Hi, Edward.

59:14.585 --> 59:15.920
Hi, Sylvia.

59:15.953 --> 59:17.254
Where's Jack?

59:17.287 --> 59:18.789
He's making a movie.

59:18.823 --> 59:20.858
- He got a job?
- Yeah, he did.

59:20.891 --> 59:22.860
We thought
we'd surprise you.

59:22.893 --> 59:24.962
Oh, you certainly did.
It's wonderful.

59:24.995 --> 59:26.764
You must stay with us.

59:26.797 --> 59:29.033
Oh. Is that all right
with you, darling?

59:29.066 --> 59:30.601
Of course. Of course.

59:31.902 --> 59:33.203
Mary:
How did you find us?

59:33.237 --> 59:34.905
It was no trouble
at all.

59:34.939 --> 59:37.274
Vera: I'm not surprised.
Everyone knows this house.

59:37.307 --> 59:39.610
I'll show you my horse.
His name is Slam-dunk.

59:39.644 --> 59:40.945
Let's go see him!

59:40.978 --> 59:43.213
You'd probably like
to unpack first.

59:43.247 --> 59:44.749
Oh, sure. Sorry.

59:44.782 --> 59:47.785
Barrow, would you
show these gentlemen

59:47.818 --> 59:49.219
to the guest rooms
in the west wing?

59:49.253 --> 59:51.121
Very good, Miss.

59:55.760 --> 59:57.662
Hmm. Not bad.

59:57.695 --> 59:58.929
Nice.

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:04.101
The water closet
is in here, sir.

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:08.939
You were very well
behaved before.

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:11.341
Well, we're all civilized
people, Michael.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:13.343
[urinating]

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.683
- Michael! Peter!
- Oh!

01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:20.150
Hey!

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:26.991
What'd you guys bring me?

01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:28.258
Gee, I don't know,
Pete.

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:29.794
Did we bring
anything for Mare?

01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:30.995
I can't remember. Maybe--

01:00:31.028 --> 01:00:32.262
Look in that suitcase.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:34.298
Yeah! Look at that.

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:37.134
and Jack sent you
a makeup case.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.904
- Neat. It's just like his.
- Yeah.

01:00:41.706 --> 01:00:45.175
Dinner will be served
promptly at 8, gentlemen.

01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:46.343
Oh.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.220
Sure we're not overdressed?

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:58.989
Trust me. I saw "Brideshead
Revisited" three times.

01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:09.399
Has someone died?

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:11.001
Not yet.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:16.673
Peter, Michael,
let me introduce you.

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:18.008
This is Deirdre Coleman.

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:19.810
Deirdre's
with the foreign service.

01:01:19.844 --> 01:01:22.046
And Wilfred Blair, director
of the National Theater.

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:24.715
Edward's told me so much
about your commune.

01:01:24.749 --> 01:01:26.183
How do you do?

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:28.819
And Reverend Hewitt,
who'll be marrying us.

01:01:28.853 --> 01:01:31.188
How do you do?
Is there any more salmon?

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:32.890
This is Peter Mitchell,
Michael Kellum,

01:01:32.923 --> 01:01:34.091
friends of Sylvia's.

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:35.860
Yes, but is there
any more salmon?

01:01:35.893 --> 01:01:38.162
Yes, of course.
Oh, there is Sylvia now.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:41.698
Peter, there's someone over
here I'd love you to meet.

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:49.073
Elspeth, I'd love you
to meet Peter Mitchell.

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:50.775
Miss Elspeth Lomax.

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:53.043
- Oh. How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:01:53.077 --> 01:01:54.879
Miss Lomax
is from Guernsey.

01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:57.347
Oh, where the cows
come from.

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.949
That's right.

01:01:58.983 --> 01:02:00.450
- And Mr. Mitchell is...
- An architect.

01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:02.920
Oh. Well, then,

01:02:02.953 --> 01:02:05.289
do you align yourself
with the post-modernists,

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:07.758
or are you a bit more
of a classicist?

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:09.393
What? Um...

01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:12.396
Prince Charles is having
war in this country with--

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.868
Ooh, bang.

01:02:17.902 --> 01:02:20.537
Sorry. Um...

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.739
No, uh...

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:30.147
There's some roe
on your nose.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.882
Oh, goodness.

01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:33.750
- Um...
- I'm sorry.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.085
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:37.321
What is it that you do?

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:39.123
- Me?
- Uh-huh.

01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:42.092
I'm the headmistress
of a girls' school

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:43.393
in West Riding.

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:45.229
You may have heard of it.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.064
The Pileforth Academy.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.334
Pileforth? No.
I can't say that I have.

01:02:50.367 --> 01:02:53.237
Well, we've been turning out
England's finest young ladies

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.805
since the 18th century.

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:57.474
Excuse me.

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.909
Mary'd like to see us.

01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:01.946
Oh, sorry.
Lovely to meet you.

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:04.014
It was very nice
meeting you.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.490
I think he fancies you.

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:15.292
Don't be such a rogue.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:19.129
What makes you say that?

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:20.430
He asked to meet you.

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:21.866
I know Peter pretty well.

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:23.167
Do you?

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.202
A woman has to walk
a very fine line with him.

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:26.436
How so?

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:27.938
She has to make it
very clear

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:29.206
that she's
attracted to him,

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:31.008
but she can't come on
too strongly.

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:35.312
Say no more.

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:40.450
Peter:
You ever get the feeling
you're being watched?

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:42.486
I make up stories
about them.

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.021
I think she was
on the cover

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:46.156
of "Rolling Stone"
last year.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.325
We brought super-chunk
peanut butter.

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:49.860
We brought some
from New York.

01:03:49.894 --> 01:03:51.061
- Yeah!
- Okay.

01:03:51.095 --> 01:03:52.462
Wait here.
I'll get it.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:54.831
Run. What about
this one, honey?

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:02.072
Oh, Peter.

01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:03.908
- I was just going to get...
- I was just going to see...

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:06.010
- I'm sorry.
- No, what were you gonna say?

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:07.878
Is everything all right?

01:04:09.113 --> 01:04:10.514
Towels, blankets?

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:12.883
Everything's fine.

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:14.885
You look great.

01:04:14.919 --> 01:04:17.187
So do you.

01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:19.890
Well, Sylvia--

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:29.066
You know how you want
to say something

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:30.434
and then you don't,

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:32.536
and then,
by the time you say it,

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:35.372
it's been such a long time.

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:37.874
Well,
I remember one time,

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:40.410
Sandra, she used to be
my assistant,

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:42.412
she never told me
this guy called.

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:44.114
Peter, what is it
you want to say?

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:49.586
I'm sorry about what I said
before you left.

01:04:51.155 --> 01:04:52.689
So am I.

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.358
I overreacted.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:57.127
Mm-mm. Well, you got
a pretty good right hook,

01:04:57.161 --> 01:04:59.229
but if anybody
deserved it, I did.

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:03.067
I was out of line,
way out of line.

01:05:04.668 --> 01:05:06.203
Ahem.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:07.471
I beg your pardon, Miss.

01:05:07.504 --> 01:05:10.174
Lady Eastwick is leaving.

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:14.044
I have to go.

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:15.512
Sure. It's all right.

01:05:25.089 --> 01:05:26.623
Jack,
how's the movie going?

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:28.392
Oh, it's a fabulous role,
Michael.

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:31.628
Kind of a South American
King Lear.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.497
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about me.

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.565
- Where's Mary?
- She's asleep.

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:37.134
Oh, shoot.

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:40.570
Well, how's she doing?
Is she any bigger?

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:42.306
Has she got the accent
down yet?

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:44.674
She's okay. She missed us.

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:46.410
She misses you, Jack.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:49.513
Yeah.
Tell her I miss her, too.

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.982
Jack, you gonna make it
to the wedding?

01:05:52.016 --> 01:05:53.583
I don't know, Michael.

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.252
I really need the work,

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.187
and I'm very pivotal
to the plot.

01:05:57.221 --> 01:05:58.422
We need you here.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.591
Hey, Fruit of the Loom,
you're on!

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.627
I gotta go, Michael.
Yeah. Bye-bye.

01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:07.431
Oi, Charlie,
give us a hand!

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.665
[chatter]

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.702
Not so splendid
as your mighty erections,

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:47.237
I imagine.

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:54.311
Did I frighten you?

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.313
I was expecting Mary.
That's all.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.348
Ah, little Mary, yes.

01:06:58.382 --> 01:07:03.019
What a delightful
if somewhat willful child.

01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:05.089
She'll make an excellent
Pileforth student.

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:07.724
She's going to your school?

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:10.360
Well, not immediately,
no, no, no,

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:11.661
but eventually.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:13.730
I'm sorry, but she
wouldn't like it.

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.265
What makes you say that?

01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:16.600
I just know, that's all.

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:19.336
Boarding school
is definitely not for her.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:25.342
Tell me, are you always such
a slave to your instincts?

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.611
No, not usually.

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:29.246
Don't underestimate

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:31.515
what a school like Pileforth
can do for a young lady.

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:35.285
After all, I'm
a Pileforth girl myself.

01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:39.456
Oh. That's reassuring.

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:43.460
In fact, I'm-- I'm going
back there this morning.

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:46.263
I was just wondering

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:50.400
whether you'd like
to, um... visit.

01:07:53.237 --> 01:07:55.439
No, but thank you.

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:56.606
No.

01:08:02.312 --> 01:08:03.780
I hope you don't mind
my saying this,

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:07.151
but you seem to be
a little distracted.

01:08:08.352 --> 01:08:09.586
Do I?

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:14.391
Well, you're right. I--

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.893
I'm very confused right now.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:20.163
I can't make any sense
out of anything.

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:23.500
Really? How do you mean?

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:26.803
Well, you're a woman.

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.604
You are correct.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:29.839
Well, tell me something.

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:32.176
How can a man
look at a woman

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:34.578
and not realize right away
how he feels about her?

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.279
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

01:08:36.313 --> 01:08:37.647
Well, I must admit

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.783
to not being the most
worldly of women,

01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:43.587
but I can assure you
that I'm not oblivious

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.689
of the ways of Eros.

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:47.457
Well, if I'm
so attracted to her,

01:08:47.491 --> 01:08:49.326
why can't I tell her?

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.761
Perhaps those of us

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:55.765
who have navigated
the river of life singly

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:59.469
are wary
of rocking the punt.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.207
I don't know what to do.

01:09:04.241 --> 01:09:06.542
Well, tell her.

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:08.178
Hmm.

01:09:08.212 --> 01:09:09.613
Seek
the auspicious moment

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:12.515
and, um, tell her.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:24.560
Mary:
Colder, colder, colder,

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:27.197
colder.

01:09:27.231 --> 01:09:30.234
Warmer, warmer.

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:31.501
Getting warmer.

01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:34.504
Warmer, warmer.

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.506
[clang]

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.907
Isn't this fun?

01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:39.876
A splendid game.

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:43.346
I can see why
so many cherish it.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.917
Warmer, hotter, hotter.

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:50.254
Very hot! Very hot!

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:52.721
Edward: Oh, for God's sake,
what have you done now?

01:09:52.756 --> 01:09:54.358
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

01:09:54.391 --> 01:09:56.660
Do you have any idea how
important these letters are?

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.995
It's my fault.
I made him play.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.564
I told you
not to play your games

01:10:00.597 --> 01:10:01.765
in the house, didn't I?

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:05.535
No, no.
Leave them alone!

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:07.904
Barrow, get me
some towels, will you?

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:12.342
I'm sick of rearranging my life
because of a child!

01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:14.411
You'll learn some manners at
school. Now go to your room!

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.851
He doesn't like me.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:24.288
He's always yelling at me.

01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:26.423
He yelled at me this morning

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:28.525
when Miss Lomax
was measuring me.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.360
When she was what,
sweetie?

01:10:30.394 --> 01:10:33.630
Measuring me
for my new clothes.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:35.499
What new clothes?

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.437
A blue jacket,
a patch right here,

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.839
like the other girls wear.

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:51.615
She means a uniform.

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:54.718
Miss Lomax
was measuring Mary
for a school uniform.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.553
Why?

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.655
I think Edward's
planning on sending Mary

01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:00.390
to that boarding school.

01:11:00.424 --> 01:11:02.792
At 6 years old?
Those places are
like reformatories.

01:11:02.826 --> 01:11:04.928
I think we should
check this out.

01:11:31.388 --> 01:11:32.856
Do you like it here?

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:34.358
It's wonderful, sir.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:41.965
Hi, there.

01:11:49.573 --> 01:11:51.307
It's a Stepford school.

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:54.844
So...

01:11:54.878 --> 01:11:58.482
the skeptical American
has changed his mind

01:11:58.515 --> 01:12:00.650
and come to judge
for himself.

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:01.951
We had some time.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.354
So we got in the car
and came up.

01:12:04.388 --> 01:12:06.623
Oh, well,
you must be hungry.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:10.694
Come. Let me satisfy
your appetite.

01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:24.140
What's the usual age
of a girl who comes here?

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:28.144
Well, the usual age of an
enrolling student is 8.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.679
But we have made exceptions

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:31.581
for children as young
as 6 or 7.

01:12:31.615 --> 01:12:33.483
That sounds
very young.

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:35.051
Ah, yes,
but the system has worked

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:37.387
for more than 200 years.

01:12:37.421 --> 01:12:39.556
We take great care
of our girls.

01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:41.658
For example, we have
a registered nutritionist

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.760
who supervises
all our meals.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:48.164
Didn't you enjoy
your lunch?

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.767
I've never tasted
anything better.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.368
But you haven't
touched it.

01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:00.844
This is where
the girls sleep.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.446
Nice.

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:06.082
Well, it's not
exactly the Hilton,

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:08.552
but it's certainly
conducive to study.

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:12.522
I spent many a happy night
in this dormitory.

01:13:12.556 --> 01:13:13.723
Hmm.

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:16.192
This is the very room

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:20.196
where the late Duke of Pileforth
used to kennel his hounds.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:22.098
Peter:
I can tell.

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:25.735
Look, it's not as cold
as it might first appear.

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:30.540
You know, sometimes, beneath
the most rigid surface

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:33.610
lies a surprising... fervor.

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:45.088
What's the matter,
darling?

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:47.757
I'm concerned about Mary.

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:49.926
She'll come around.
You'll see.

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:54.030
I'm nervous about tomorrow.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:56.933
Don't you want
to get married?

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:58.602
Yes. Of course I do.

01:13:58.635 --> 01:14:01.004
I-- I think so.
Yes, yes, yes, I do.

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:02.906
Why do you ask?

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:05.742
Everything's going
to be fine. I promise.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.443
You son of a bitch.
You're planning

01:14:07.477 --> 01:14:09.078
on sending Mary
to that boarding school.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:11.114
What are you talking
about?

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:12.949
We went to Pileforth
this afternoon.

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:14.618
He's planning
to send Mary there.

01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:16.820
In five or six years,
that's a possibility.

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:19.455
No, not in five
or six years. Next term!

01:14:19.489 --> 01:14:22.025
- That's not true.
- He's lying to you.

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:24.794
- Rubbish.
- Then why was Miss Lomax
measuring Mary?

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:27.096
- Was she?
- For a uniform.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.665
A gift.

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:30.867
She asked me if she could
give Mary a blazer.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.802
- Why?
- Because she said

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:35.772
with the presents we'll get,
Mary might feel left out.

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:37.774
I think that's
a very sweet thought.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:40.143
- Yes, I thought so.
- What a crock.

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:43.613
Did you come here just
to stir up trouble, Mitchell?

01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:45.882
Darling, it's just
a misunderstanding,
that's all.

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:47.283
No,
it's not a misunderstanding.

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.686
I'm telling you,
you can't trust this guy.

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:51.487
He's lying.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:53.289
Peter, you have
no proof of that.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.660
I don't need any proof.
I feel it.

01:14:56.693 --> 01:14:58.695
Who bloody cares?

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:04.133
Edward! I made it!
I'm here! Ha!

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.869
Hallelujah.

01:15:07.604 --> 01:15:11.507
What-- Sylvia, you can't
marry this guy.

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:13.076
- Why not?
- Because.

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:14.778
Tell me, Peter.
I want to know.

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:19.248
For Mary's sake.

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:24.520
You may not like Edward,

01:15:24.554 --> 01:15:27.023
but I love him,
and I'm going to marry him.

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:29.559
I'd tell you not to bother
coming tomorrow,

01:15:29.593 --> 01:15:30.860
but Mary would be crushed.

01:15:30.894 --> 01:15:32.996
So for her sake,
please do come.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:36.733
But as far as I'm concerned,
stay out of my life.

01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:41.337
Hi.

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.706
Hi.

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:53.883
Glad to see you haven't
lost your touch
with women there, Pete.

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:56.352
Ever think about making
an instructional video?

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.554
What'd you want to say,
Jack?

01:15:58.588 --> 01:16:02.058
Look, I know a lot of people
don't take me seriously.

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:05.962
They think I'm conceited,
self-centered,

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:09.198
that I can't see anything
except if it's happening to me.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:11.200
Please correct me
if I'm wrong here.

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:12.769
I will.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.245
Look, Pete,

01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:24.981
I've lived with you
for seven years now.

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:27.651
I know you as well
as anybody-- better.

01:16:27.684 --> 01:16:30.286
These last five years

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:33.657
with Mary and Sylvia
and Michael and me,

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:36.926
you have been the glue
that kept us together.

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:40.329
We depended on you.
I mean,

01:16:40.363 --> 01:16:43.867
we made you the father,
and it worked.

01:16:45.301 --> 01:16:47.136
But it's kept you
from admitting

01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:49.673
how you feel about Sylvia.

01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:51.841
You love her, don't you?

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.311
Why do you say that?

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:57.013
Don't you?

01:16:58.982 --> 01:17:01.617
Aw, come on, Pete.

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:03.186
Just say how you feel.

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:04.988
Okay, I love her!

01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:06.923
Damn it, I knew it!

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.958
I wish they had a category
like this on "Jeopardy."

01:17:08.992 --> 01:17:11.627
I'd clean up. Okay, Pete,
what's holding you back?

01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:13.096
- I don't know.
- Come on.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:14.998
- You know!
- I don't know!

01:17:15.031 --> 01:17:17.033
- Well, you, for one.
- Me?

01:17:17.066 --> 01:17:18.835
Yeah. You're Mary's
real father.

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:21.270
- So?
- You're my best friend, too.

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:23.940
And you and Sylvia,
you're kissing all the time.

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:25.809
You're always telling her
how much you love her!

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:28.011
That's actor stuff.
That doesn't mean
what you think.

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:31.280
Well, I always figured you
and she would eventually--

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:32.816
You were there.
I asked her.

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:34.718
She said no, I didn't
love her that way.

01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:36.319
And she was right, too.
I don't.

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:38.788
Not that I couldn't fool her.
But that's not the point.

01:17:38.822 --> 01:17:41.791
You do love her that way,
and she loves you.

01:17:41.825 --> 01:17:43.960
- She loves me?
- Yes.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.328
Then why is she
marrying Edward?

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:47.030
Because you never asked her!

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:51.701
- Yeah, but you--
- But what, Pete?

01:18:02.045 --> 01:18:04.080
I-I'm scared.

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:06.983
Of what,
getting married again?

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:08.818
Yes.

01:18:08.852 --> 01:18:11.054
I love Sylvia.
Okay, there. I said it.

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:13.823
I love her. I love her so much,
it's making me crazy.

01:18:13.857 --> 01:18:18.194
But I'm scared of screwing up
like I did the last time.

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:19.929
I'm scared of hurting Sylvia

01:18:19.963 --> 01:18:22.966
and Mary and you and Michael.

01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:26.402
and me.

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:30.073
Boy, it's tough being
Papa Bear, isn't it?

01:18:31.908 --> 01:18:35.011
I love you.
You're a very special man.

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:38.014
If anyone deserves
to be happy, it's you.

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:41.918
If you love her,
you've gotta go for it.

01:18:41.951 --> 01:18:44.788
You can make it work,
believe me.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.093
You're a good friend.

01:18:50.126 --> 01:18:53.229
I'm a great friend.
What's this good shit?

01:18:53.262 --> 01:18:55.198
I'm going
back to Pileforth!

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:56.866
Maybe you should think
this through again.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.768
- I think too much.
- He does. He's right.

01:18:58.802 --> 01:19:01.037
Don't try
and talk me out of it.
I love Sylvia.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.772
Then go
tell her that.

01:19:02.806 --> 01:19:05.141
She won't listen to me till I
prove the guy's a fraud.

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:07.376
- How?
- There's got to be something.

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:09.112
You know, records,
a file, something

01:19:09.145 --> 01:19:11.047
to show that he's
sending Mary there.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.281
Suppose you're wrong.

01:19:12.315 --> 01:19:14.217
Then I'm wrong.
What have I got to lose?

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:16.820
Your words, Jack-- If you
want something, go for it.

01:19:16.853 --> 01:19:18.054
Jack!

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:20.489
There you are, baby doll!

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:24.093
I knew you were coming.
I told Sabrina you would.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.996
Where are you going?

01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:28.965
I'll be back.

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:31.267
I love your mom.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:34.103
He's been really weird.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.275
[engine sputtering]

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:19.315
[nose blowing]

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:41.337
[humming]

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:42.906
[creak]

01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:45.274
[creak]

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.244
Is there someone there?

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:02.926
Mr. Mitchell!

01:21:02.959 --> 01:21:05.328
What are you doing
in my closet?

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:08.364
Sometimes
a man has to be alone.

01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:13.136
And sometimes he needs
companionship.

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:16.539
Oh, no. Wait, look.
I'm sorry,

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:18.908
but I've gotta be
totally honest with you.

01:21:18.942 --> 01:21:21.044
Let's just lay it out
right on the table.

01:21:21.077 --> 01:21:23.212
Oh, I'm glad
that your infatuation

01:21:23.246 --> 01:21:25.014
has at last found a voice.

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:27.116
- It has?
- We have no more excuses now.

01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:29.618
We are creatures
of the night.

01:21:29.652 --> 01:21:32.521
We are children of la luna!

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:35.358
Wait, we're breaking
all the rules of propriety.

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:38.094
Oh, rules, rules, rules
are made to be broken.

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:40.429
- Oh, kiss me!
- What about the girls?

01:21:40.463 --> 01:21:43.099
They can't have you!

01:21:43.132 --> 01:21:44.900
I've never met your family.

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:48.371
I've never asked
your father's permission.

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.106
My father's
a doddering old fool!

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:52.575
Then there's something
I have to tell you.

01:21:54.277 --> 01:21:56.045
I'm impotent!

01:21:56.079 --> 01:21:59.415
Oh, I find that
so charming in a man.

01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:03.552
Miss Lomax-- Elspeth--

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:05.621
Oh, shut up and take me!

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:10.259
Am I everything
you expected?

01:22:10.293 --> 01:22:12.161
And more, much more!

01:22:12.195 --> 01:22:13.462
No!

01:22:13.496 --> 01:22:15.098
We can't, not tonight!

01:22:15.131 --> 01:22:16.565
Not like this.

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:18.467
We mustn't let
one night of passion

01:22:18.501 --> 01:22:19.969
cloud our entire
relationship.

01:22:20.003 --> 01:22:22.005
Oh, I understand
what you're saying.

01:22:22.038 --> 01:22:23.572
As hard as it may be
for both of us,

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:25.975
we must
control ourselves.

01:22:26.009 --> 01:22:27.210
Good night.

01:22:33.116 --> 01:22:37.620
Oh, you are a true gentleman.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.057
Damn it.

01:22:43.492 --> 01:22:45.394
[engine sputtering]

01:23:02.345 --> 01:23:03.479
[engine backfires,
then stops]

01:23:05.748 --> 01:23:07.216
Damn.

01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:15.624
Darling, where have you been?
We have so much to do.

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:17.493
I wanted a few
moments by myself.

01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:19.462
Feeling nervous, are you?

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:20.629
A little.

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:22.531
It's quite natural
to feel nervous.

01:23:22.565 --> 01:23:26.135
After all,
in less than two hours,

01:23:26.169 --> 01:23:29.505
you'll be leaving a whole part
of your life behind you,

01:23:29.538 --> 01:23:32.508
and entering
a lifelong contract

01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:35.178
that will change everything
you've ever known.

01:23:35.211 --> 01:23:37.346
Thank you, Mother.
I feel so much better now.

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.348
That's what mothers are for.
Come on, darling.

01:23:58.067 --> 01:23:59.835
The good news is
I've got the proof.

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:02.438
The bad news is
I'm still a long way away.

01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:04.673
Don't worry. Jack and I
are cooking up a plan.

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:06.609
All you have to do
is get here.

01:24:06.642 --> 01:24:08.444
The cavalry just showed up.
I'll be there.

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.082
Wait! Stop!

01:24:13.116 --> 01:24:15.084
Boy, am I glad to see you.

01:24:15.118 --> 01:24:17.786
Mr. Mitchell!
What are you doing here?

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.622
I'll explain everything.
Let's go.

01:24:19.655 --> 01:24:22.391
We've got to stall the wedding
till Peter gets back.

01:24:22.425 --> 01:24:24.193
- I'm ready.
- You with us?

01:24:24.227 --> 01:24:25.394
Yes!

01:24:25.428 --> 01:24:27.230
All right,
we've got one hour.

01:24:27.263 --> 01:24:28.431
Yo!

01:24:28.464 --> 01:24:29.698
This way, vicar.

01:24:29.732 --> 01:24:31.200
I haven't finished
my breakfast.

01:24:31.234 --> 01:24:32.401
Where are you taking me?

01:24:32.435 --> 01:24:33.702
See, they've
moved the ceremony.

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:35.471
I'm driving you
to a new church.

01:24:35.504 --> 01:24:37.306
No one told me about this.
Who are you?

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:39.108
Ah, Vicar, that's an
extremely interesting

01:24:39.142 --> 01:24:41.444
theological question.
Who are any of us?

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:43.579
Good point. You know,
I've often suggested

01:24:43.612 --> 01:24:46.415
my congregation ask itself
that very question.

01:24:46.449 --> 01:24:49.452
And if, in fact,
we exist at all.

01:24:49.485 --> 01:24:52.421
Well, I have a syllogism
that answers that problem.

01:24:52.455 --> 01:24:56.425
It goes like this:
all pigs exist. I exist.

01:24:56.459 --> 01:25:00.396
Therefore, I am a pig.
No, that's not right.

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:02.598
Um, oh, yes. I've got it.

01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:05.634
All people exist.
All pigs exist.

01:25:05.668 --> 01:25:07.403
Therefore,
all people are pigs.

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.671
[engine starts]

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.673
No, that's not it, either.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:15.744
I was under the impression
that Sylvia knew

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:17.780
that Mary was to be
enrolled for next term.

01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:19.748
She has absolutely no idea.

01:25:19.782 --> 01:25:22.385
How extraordinary.

01:25:25.321 --> 01:25:27.856
All they said was
the vicar was ill.

01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:29.592
We'll have to find another.

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:31.460
Yes. I mean,
you can't swing a dead cat

01:25:31.494 --> 01:25:32.795
around the English
countryside

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:34.463
without hitting a vicar.

01:25:34.497 --> 01:25:36.665
More news from the vicarage.

01:25:36.699 --> 01:25:38.667
They're sending a replacement.

01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:41.304
Ah! Ha ha.
Oh, there you are.

01:25:41.337 --> 01:25:44.273
What's hard to believe is
that it's taken five years

01:25:44.307 --> 01:25:46.475
to realize my true
feelings for her.

01:25:46.509 --> 01:25:48.377
Look,
I'm sorry if I misled you.

01:25:48.411 --> 01:25:50.279
Say no more.

01:25:50.313 --> 01:25:52.515
All is fair
in love and war.

01:25:52.548 --> 01:25:54.717
You're a very
attractive woman.

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:57.786
Oh, I know.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:01.290
We've got to get you to the
church before the wedding.

01:26:01.324 --> 01:26:03.292
We shall succeed.

01:26:03.326 --> 01:26:05.194
I know a shortcut.

01:26:09.732 --> 01:26:12.368
[honk]
Aah!

01:26:23.379 --> 01:26:25.348
Man: You'll never
get that out, lad.

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:28.684
Do you have a car
we could use?

01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:31.687
A horse?

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.589
Anything that moves?

01:26:58.981 --> 01:27:01.684
Ahem.
Bride or groom, sir?

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:03.552
Just a guest, thank you.

01:27:04.987 --> 01:27:06.722
Michael: I think that's
the church up there.

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:12.761
I certainly hope we haven't
missed the champagne.

01:27:12.795 --> 01:27:14.430
[congregation singing]

01:27:14.463 --> 01:27:17.900
Vicar, wait! I was wrong!
This isn't the wedding!

01:27:17.933 --> 01:27:19.302
What?

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:23.872
* All things
bright and beautiful *

01:27:23.906 --> 01:27:25.608
What a joyous event

01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:28.677
we have come here to celebrate
this glorious day.

01:27:38.621 --> 01:27:40.389
I look like a dork.

01:27:40.423 --> 01:27:42.057
You don't look like a dork.

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:43.992
You look very beautiful.

01:27:44.026 --> 01:27:45.894
Edward give you the ring?

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:47.563
- Yes.
- Where is it?

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:48.931
It's in my pocket.

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:52.335
Peter's not here yet.

01:27:52.368 --> 01:27:53.736
He will be.

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:56.339
It's not right without him.

01:27:56.372 --> 01:27:57.906
You're too young now,

01:27:57.940 --> 01:27:59.742
but one day you'll
understand all this.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.577
I understand now.

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:02.911
Do you?

01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:04.647
Peter loves you.

01:28:18.461 --> 01:28:21.296
Keep everybody happy.
The vicar's not here yet.

01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:35.911
I'm starting a wave.

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:41.784
Oh, vicar.

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:44.353
We're grateful you could
come on such short notice.

01:28:44.387 --> 01:28:47.022
Oh. Not to worry.
I love weddings.

01:28:47.055 --> 01:28:50.626
People are always
so hopeful.

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:52.461
No, this way.

01:28:52.495 --> 01:28:53.829
Oh, yes.

01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:56.365
Oh!

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:03.839
What time is it?

01:29:16.385 --> 01:29:17.986
Oh, you look lovely, darling.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:20.989
Look, we're going to have
to go ahead without them.

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:22.991
Yes, but who'll
give me away?

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:24.993
Oh...

01:29:25.027 --> 01:29:26.762
[organ begins
the Wedding March]

01:30:13.842 --> 01:30:15.511
Sit down.

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:33.061
Oh, what a beautiful
girl.

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:35.230
It's never too late, you know.

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.566
You can always
change your mind.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.001
I'm available.

01:30:42.204 --> 01:30:43.872
Just kidding.

01:30:45.608 --> 01:30:47.576
Dearly beloved,

01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:50.679
we are gathered here today

01:30:50.713 --> 01:30:53.782
to join in holy matrimony

01:30:53.816 --> 01:30:55.951
Edward...

01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:57.620
and...

01:30:59.054 --> 01:31:00.589
Oh, dear.

01:31:00.623 --> 01:31:01.857
Sylvia.

01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:03.826
Sylvia. Of course.

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:07.095
I knew a Sylvia once.

01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:09.598
She, uh...

01:31:09.632 --> 01:31:11.033
uh...

01:31:11.066 --> 01:31:13.468
No. She's dead.

01:31:13.502 --> 01:31:14.937
That's not you.

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.939
Anyway, uh...

01:31:16.972 --> 01:31:19.642
to join in holy matrimony

01:31:19.675 --> 01:31:22.611
Ed and Sylvia.

01:31:22.645 --> 01:31:25.814
You don't mind if I
call you Ed, do you?

01:31:28.851 --> 01:31:31.019
You're doing splendidly!

01:31:31.053 --> 01:31:32.220
Thank you.

01:31:33.889 --> 01:31:36.058
- I can't see!
- Oh!

01:31:36.091 --> 01:31:38.126
Ohh!

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.629
I don't know where it is.

01:31:40.663 --> 01:31:41.997
She had it just now.

01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:43.532
You're doing this
on purpose, aren't you?

01:31:43.566 --> 01:31:44.833
I'll handle this.

01:31:46.168 --> 01:31:48.503
Darling, where
did you have it last?

01:31:48.537 --> 01:31:50.238
It was on the pillow.

01:31:51.774 --> 01:31:53.809
We can't wait forever.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:57.045
Oh, dear.
This does not bode well.

01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:01.884
Does anyone have a ring?

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:07.590
Here.

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:10.793
I have one.

01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:34.282
Elspeth:
There's the chapel!

01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:37.853
Oh, dear.
I hate this part.

01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:39.855
It is, after all,
in the rule book.

01:32:39.888 --> 01:32:42.024
If there be anyone here

01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:47.562
who knows of any reason,
any reason whatsoever--

01:32:47.596 --> 01:32:51.867
It may not seem like
an important detail to you,

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:56.071
but you never can tell in
the immortal scheme of things.

01:32:56.104 --> 01:32:59.241
One man's pie and all that.

01:32:59.274 --> 01:33:04.713
So, if there be any doubt,
any doubt at all,

01:33:04.747 --> 01:33:09.251
we might as well lay it out
on the table right now

01:33:09.284 --> 01:33:12.220
why these two lovely people

01:33:12.254 --> 01:33:15.791
should not be joined
in holy matrimony.

01:33:15.824 --> 01:33:20.195
Speak now
or forever hold your peace.

01:33:21.997 --> 01:33:23.265
Hmm.

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:28.236
Anyone?

01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.138
I think it's safe
to continue.

01:33:30.172 --> 01:33:31.339
Hmm. Oh.

01:33:31.373 --> 01:33:33.909
Huh. Oh, wait!

01:33:33.942 --> 01:33:36.244
Is that your hand up,
back there?

01:33:36.278 --> 01:33:39.114
Yes, you.
The lady in the back row.

01:33:39.147 --> 01:33:40.315
Man; What's he
talking about?

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:42.751
2nd, 3rd, 4th,
5th from the left!

01:33:42.785 --> 01:33:46.354
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:33:46.388 --> 01:33:48.924
It's your hat.
Looked like your hand.

01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:51.126
Can we please
get on with this?

01:33:51.159 --> 01:33:53.161
Where do they get
these hats from?

01:33:53.195 --> 01:33:54.997
Imagine, a piece of millinery

01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:56.999
almost kept you
from getting married.

01:34:07.375 --> 01:34:08.744
Hang on!

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:23.692

01:34:26.895 --> 01:34:28.296
- Good show!
- Yahoo!

01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:31.199

by Almighty God,

I now pronounce you

01:34:40.843 --> 01:34:43.278
man and wife.

01:34:44.346 --> 01:34:47.315
About bloody time.

01:34:47.349 --> 01:34:50.018
You may kiss the bride.

01:35:00.195 --> 01:35:02.164
Why aren't you inside?
Is it too late?

01:35:02.197 --> 01:35:04.032
Go on in!
I'll explain later!

01:35:04.066 --> 01:35:06.001
Come on, vicar!

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:07.269
Vicar!

01:35:10.806 --> 01:35:11.940
Sylvia!

01:35:14.476 --> 01:35:16.111
Don't marry him.

01:35:16.144 --> 01:35:17.846
What are you doing?

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.848
- Michael: He got it.
- What are you talking about?

01:35:19.882 --> 01:35:21.083
He went to Pileforth.

01:35:21.116 --> 01:35:23.018
I got the enrollment
list. Mary's on it.

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:24.252
Her tuition's
all paid up.

01:35:24.286 --> 01:35:26.188
- Not this again.
- You shut up.

01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:27.389
Tell her, Elspeth.

01:35:29.091 --> 01:35:30.725
It's true.

01:35:37.499 --> 01:35:39.768
You lied to me.

01:35:39.802 --> 01:35:41.536
This is not the time
or the place.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.738
You lied to Mary.
Peter was right.

01:35:43.772 --> 01:35:46.809
Wait a moment, darling.
I was going to tell you
about this.

01:35:46.842 --> 01:35:48.210
Well, tell her now,
Edward.

01:35:48.243 --> 01:35:51.880
Look, I only did it
out of concern for Mary.

01:35:51.914 --> 01:35:54.382
On the road with a play is
no way for a child to live.

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:56.251
Why didn't you tell me?

01:35:56.284 --> 01:35:58.220
Because I didn't want
to burden you with it

01:35:58.253 --> 01:36:01.089
while you were dealing
with all this wedding
confusion.

01:36:01.123 --> 01:36:04.893
What I did was wrong,
terribly wrong,

01:36:04.927 --> 01:36:06.294
and I apologize
for that.

01:36:06.328 --> 01:36:07.796
What a crock!

01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:09.097
Oh, shut up,
you little shit.

- That's it.

Sylvia: Oh!

01:36:13.468 --> 01:36:15.103
Sorry, Vicar.

01:36:15.137 --> 01:36:17.239
I'm getting out of here.
Come along, Mary.

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:20.008
Sylvia, wait.
Wait, Sylvia, please!

01:36:20.042 --> 01:36:21.209
Now let me finish.

01:36:22.377 --> 01:36:23.511
Marry me.

01:36:25.981 --> 01:36:27.382
Marry you?

01:36:29.484 --> 01:36:31.153
Why, Peter?

01:36:31.186 --> 01:36:33.188
For Mary's sake?

01:36:33.221 --> 01:36:35.257
Is that why you want me
to marry you?

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:37.792
You don't have
to do that now.

01:36:37.826 --> 01:36:40.128
I'm going back to New York
and living there.

01:36:40.162 --> 01:36:42.330
You can see as much
of Mary as you'd like.

01:36:42.364 --> 01:36:44.499
It's not for Mary
I'm doing this.

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:46.869
I'm doing it for me.

01:36:47.970 --> 01:36:49.137
I love you.

01:36:53.976 --> 01:36:55.844
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

01:36:55.878 --> 01:36:57.345
I love you.

01:36:57.379 --> 01:36:59.047
I love the way you walk.

01:36:59.081 --> 01:37:01.316
I love the way you laugh.

01:37:01.349 --> 01:37:04.953
I love the way you get nervous
and you bite your lower lip,

01:37:04.987 --> 01:37:06.188
like you're doing right now.

01:37:06.221 --> 01:37:08.323
I love the way you love Mary.

01:37:10.092 --> 01:37:12.227
I even love her liver mousse!

01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:17.065
I love you.

01:37:17.099 --> 01:37:19.868
And if there were no Mary,
if there were nothing else,

01:37:19.902 --> 01:37:22.971
I'd still love you.

01:37:23.005 --> 01:37:26.208
And I'd want to make Mary
all over again with you.

01:37:30.612 --> 01:37:33.348
Am I making a big enough
fool of myself?

01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:34.582
Yes.

01:37:37.619 --> 01:37:39.587
I love you, too.

01:37:55.971 --> 01:37:57.139
[clapping]

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:03.211
Lovely performance, Peter.

01:38:03.245 --> 01:38:06.048
Forgive me for bringing up
a sticky point, darling,

01:38:06.081 --> 01:38:07.515
but we are married now.

01:38:07.549 --> 01:38:09.551
Oh, God, he's right.
We are.

01:38:09.584 --> 01:38:12.554
I beg to differ with you,
young man.

01:38:13.956 --> 01:38:15.357
Who are you?

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:16.891
Never mind.

01:38:16.925 --> 01:38:20.362
The ceremony is not
quite official yet.

01:38:20.395 --> 01:38:22.397
Shut up, you old fool!

01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:25.300
Did he call me an old fool?

01:38:25.333 --> 01:38:29.271
Oh, I can't believe my ears!

01:38:29.304 --> 01:38:32.240
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

01:38:32.274 --> 01:38:34.943
Boy, that hurt. Here.
Hold this for me, will you?

01:38:34.977 --> 01:38:36.244
Thank you.

01:38:36.278 --> 01:38:39.214
And you said
I couldn't fool you.

01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:43.251
Yeah, well--
Ha ha ha ha!

01:38:43.285 --> 01:38:46.154
Lousy actor, eh?

01:38:46.188 --> 01:38:48.123
Constipated?

01:38:48.156 --> 01:38:52.127
Well, in your face, pal!

01:38:53.595 --> 01:38:55.263
Here you go.
Don't be frightened.

01:38:55.297 --> 01:38:57.265
Here we go.

01:38:57.299 --> 01:38:59.234
Teeth. Thank you.
Very good.

01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:01.169
Oh.

01:39:01.203 --> 01:39:03.371
Mom.

01:39:04.439 --> 01:39:07.575
I've died and gone to hell.

01:39:07.609 --> 01:39:10.112
Vicar, will you marry us?

01:39:10.145 --> 01:39:11.513
Certainly.

01:39:11.546 --> 01:39:14.249
Who are you?

01:39:14.282 --> 01:39:19.121
By giving and receiving a ring
and by joining hands,

01:39:19.154 --> 01:39:22.624
I pronounce that they
be man and wife.

01:39:26.161 --> 01:39:28.296
You may now kiss the bride...

01:39:28.330 --> 01:39:29.664
again.

01:39:42.010 --> 01:39:45.513
* I hear your name
whispered on the wind *

01:39:45.547 --> 01:39:50.518
* It's a sound
that makes me cry *

01:39:50.552 --> 01:39:55.790
* I hear a song blow again
and again through my mind *

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:58.793
* And I don't know why

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:02.630
* I wish I didn't feel
so strong about you *

01:40:02.664 --> 01:40:06.534
* My happiness and love
revolve around you *

01:40:06.568 --> 01:40:09.671
* Tryin' to catch your heart

01:40:09.704 --> 01:40:15.343
* Is like tryin'
to catch a star *

01:40:15.377 --> 01:40:19.314
* So many people
love you, baby *

01:40:19.347 --> 01:40:22.750
* That must be what you are

01:40:22.784 --> 01:40:26.188
* Waiting for a star to fall

01:40:26.221 --> 01:40:29.491
* And carry your heart
into my arms *

01:40:29.524 --> 01:40:31.159
* That's where you belong

01:40:31.193 --> 01:40:33.461
* In my arms, baby, yeah

01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:38.366
* Waiting for a star to fall

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:41.703
* And carry your heart
into my arms *

01:40:41.736 --> 01:40:43.571
* That's where you belong

01:40:43.605 --> 01:40:46.040
* In my arms, baby, yeah

01:40:48.443 --> 01:40:51.546
* I've learned to feel
what I cannot see *

01:40:51.579 --> 01:40:57.051
* But with you
I lose that feeling *

01:40:57.085 --> 01:41:00.088
* I don't know how
to dream your dreams *

01:41:00.122 --> 01:41:05.127
* So I'm all caught up
in superstition *

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.530
* I want to reach out
and pull you to me *

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:12.700
* Who says I should
let a wild one go free? *

01:41:12.734 --> 01:41:16.070
* Tryin' to catch your heart

01:41:16.104 --> 01:41:21.409
* Is like tryin'
to catch a star *

01:41:21.443 --> 01:41:25.480
* But I can't love you
this much, baby *

01:41:25.513 --> 01:41:27.615
* And love you from this far

01:41:29.351 --> 01:41:32.154
* Waiting for a star to fall

01:41:32.187 --> 01:41:35.423
* And carry your heart
into my arms *

01:41:35.457 --> 01:41:37.292
* That's where you belong

01:41:37.325 --> 01:41:39.461
* In my arms, baby, yeah

01:41:41.763 --> 01:41:44.432
* Waiting for a star to fall

01:41:44.466 --> 01:41:47.902
* And carry your heart
into my arms *

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:49.604
* That's where you belong

01:41:49.637 --> 01:41:51.706
* In my arms, baby, yeah

01:41:54.176 --> 01:41:56.911
* Waiting

01:41:56.944 --> 01:41:59.181
* I don't like waiting

01:41:59.214 --> 01:42:01.349
* I'm waiting for you

01:42:01.383 --> 01:42:03.351
* It's so hard waiting

01:42:05.353 --> 01:42:07.755
* Seems like waiting

01:42:07.789 --> 01:42:13.828
* Makes me love you
even more *

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:44.392
* Waiting for a star to fall

01:42:44.426 --> 01:42:47.729
* To carry your heart
into my arms *

01:42:47.762 --> 01:42:49.464
* That's where you belong

01:42:49.497 --> 01:42:51.699
* In my arms, baby, yeah

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:56.871
* Waiting for a star to fall

01:42:56.904 --> 01:43:00.242
* To carry your heart
into my arms *

01:43:00.275 --> 01:43:01.743
* That's where you belong

01:43:01.776 --> 01:43:04.412
* In my arms, baby, yeah

01:43:06.514 --> 01:43:09.384
* Waiting for a star to fall

01:43:09.417 --> 01:43:12.520
* To carry your heart
into my arms *

01:43:12.554 --> 01:43:14.422
* That's where you belong

01:43:14.456 --> 01:43:17.191
* In my arms, baby, yeah

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:21.563
* Waiting for a star to fall

01:43:21.596 --> 01:43:24.832
* To carry your heart
into my arms *

01:43:24.866 --> 01:43:26.601
* That's where you belong

01:43:26.634 --> 01:43:28.903
* In my arms, baby, yeah
