00:17.216 --> 00:18.149
HEY, BABE.

00:18.217 --> 00:20.085
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:20.152 --> 00:20.886
NOTHING.

00:20.953 --> 00:23.338
SO THIRSTY.
GOD, ALL DAY.

00:23.406 --> 00:25.006
SO DRINK SOMETHING.

00:25.074 --> 00:26.741
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

00:36.885 --> 00:38.520
AHH...

00:41.823 --> 00:43.424
AHH...

00:43.492 --> 00:45.693
I'M GONNA GO
TAKE A SHOWER.

01:01.193 --> 01:02.794
HEY, WELCOME

01:02.862 --> 01:04.896
I GOT THE FIRST

01:04.964 --> 01:07.098
<i>FIVE PLANET
OF THE APES DVDs</i>

01:07.166 --> 01:08.133
LOADED UP,

01:08.200 --> 01:10.302
AND WE ARE STUPID
WITH TWIZZLERS.

01:10.369 --> 01:13.254
THAT'S THE CANDY OF ROMANCE, BY THE WAY.

01:15.324 --> 01:18.025
THAT'S SO SWEET, BUT DIDN'T
YOU GET MY MESSAGE?

01:18.093 --> 01:19.127
NO. MY PHONE'S
ON VIBRATE,

01:19.195 --> 01:20.979
AND I LEFT IT
IN MY POCKET, AND...

01:21.047 --> 01:22.346
YOU HAVE
A CIGARETTE?

01:29.455 --> 01:31.489
ANYWAY...

01:31.557 --> 01:33.691
I'M GOING TO HARTFORD
THIS WEEKEND.

01:33.759 --> 01:35.025
WHAT?

01:35.093 --> 01:36.678
YEAH,
MY BOSS IS SPONSORING

01:36.746 --> 01:38.212
THIS "HOUSES
ACROSS AMERICA" THING.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.781
I HAVE ORIENTATION
TOMORROW,

01:39.849 --> 01:41.966
THEN WE BUILD HOUSES
FOR POOR PEOPLE ON SUNDAY.

01:42.033 --> 01:43.568
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU WANT TO GO

01:43.636 --> 01:45.036
WITH THE 24-HOUR FLU
AGAIN,

01:45.103 --> 01:46.704
OR SOMETHING
IN THE MUMPS FAMILY?

01:46.772 --> 01:49.323
DOUG, STOP. NO, PLEASE.
IT'S FOR CHARITY.

01:49.392 --> 01:51.325
WELL-COME-I-

01:51.394 --> 01:52.660
I PLANNED
THIS WHOLE WEEKEND.

01:52.728 --> 01:55.062
NOW I HAVE TO WATCH
ALL THESE BY MYSELF?

01:55.130 --> 01:56.114
EXCUSE ME,
I JUST FINISHED

01:56.182 --> 01:57.582
WORKING A 60-HOUR
WORK WEEK,

01:57.649 --> 01:59.317
AND NOW
I GOT TO GET UP

01:59.384 --> 02:00.985
AT 5 IN THE MORNING

02:01.053 --> 02:03.238
TO DRIVE 120 MILES TO
POUND NAILS FOR NO MONEY.

02:03.305 --> 02:05.073
SO I AM SORRY
I CAN'T SIT

02:05.140 --> 02:07.075
AND WATCH LITTLE MONKEY
MOVIES WITH YOU, OK?

02:07.142 --> 02:08.809
OK, THEY'RE APES,
NOT MONKEYS.

02:08.877 --> 02:10.144
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

02:10.211 --> 02:11.479
WHATEVER.

02:11.546 --> 02:12.547
IT'S THAT KIND
OF ARROGANCE

02:12.615 --> 02:14.649
THAT LED TO THEM
TAKING OVER THE EARTH.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.251
OK. ALL RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT THIS, DOUG?

02:16.319 --> 02:17.519
HOW ABOUT FOR ONCE,

02:17.587 --> 02:19.887
YOU CARE ABOUT ANOTHER
PERSON OTHER THAN YOURSELF?

02:19.955 --> 02:22.023
OH, OOH, I CAN'T WATCH
MOVIES WITH MY HUSBAND

02:22.090 --> 02:24.292
'CAUSE I GOT TO BUILD
HOMES FOR THE POOR.

02:24.359 --> 02:25.660
WHO'S BEING SELFISH
NOW, HUH?

02:38.206 --> 02:39.206
FINE.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.280
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE HOME.

02:45.348 --> 02:46.581
HEY, GUY.

02:46.649 --> 02:47.649
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:47.716 --> 02:49.067
CARRIE
HAD A BUSINESS TRIP,

02:49.135 --> 02:50.701
AND WE GOT
INTO A LITTLE FIGHT,

02:50.769 --> 02:52.770
SO I'M GONNA GO UP
AND SURPRISE HER.

02:52.838 --> 02:54.756
AT LEAST YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO THIS WEEKEND.

02:54.823 --> 02:56.023
WOULD YOU LET THIS GO?

02:56.091 --> 02:57.925
WE WERE GONNA SEE
THE HUEY LEWIS CONCERT.

02:57.993 --> 02:59.860
MR. PROCRASTINATOR WAITED.
NOW WE DON'T HAVE TICKETS.

02:59.928 --> 03:01.962
DON'T ASK ME TO DO THINGS
WHEN I'M DRUNK.

03:02.030 --> 03:03.464
WHEN ARE YOU NOT?

03:03.532 --> 03:04.515
IF YOU WERE
MORE SUPPORTIVE,

03:04.583 --> 03:05.750
I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO DRINK.

03:05.817 --> 03:07.218
DON'T TURN THIS
BACK ON ME.

03:07.285 --> 03:09.254
YOU GUYS GOT
A LOT TO WORK OUT,

03:09.321 --> 03:11.522
SO WHY DON'T YOU-
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

03:11.590 --> 03:12.523
PLEASE.

03:12.591 --> 03:13.791
HEY, GUY,
WHAT'S THAT?

03:13.859 --> 03:14.959
WHAT?

03:15.027 --> 03:16.094
OH.

03:16.161 --> 03:17.245
THAT'S THE JACKET I WORE

03:17.312 --> 03:20.348
WHEN I WORKED SECURITY
AT NASSAU COLISEUM.

03:20.416 --> 03:21.882
SEE THAT RIGHT THERE?

03:21.951 --> 03:23.851
THAT'S A LITTLE
JETHRO TULL PUKE.

03:26.822 --> 03:28.222
MAN. TELL YOU WHAT.

03:28.290 --> 03:29.924
IF WE HAD
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE,

03:29.992 --> 03:31.326
WE COULD GET
INTO THE CONCERT.

03:31.393 --> 03:32.760
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:32.828 --> 03:34.696
DON'T YOU GET IT?
WE WEAR THE JACKETS,

03:34.763 --> 03:36.197
WE ACT LIKE WE WORK
THERE.

03:36.264 --> 03:39.066
WE'RE NOT ONLY IN,
WE'RE BACKSTAGE.

03:40.218 --> 03:41.719
YOU WENT TO SEE
STEEL MAGNOLIAS?

03:41.787 --> 03:43.021
GIVE ME THAT, WOULD YOU?

03:47.659 --> 03:49.193
OK, WE JUST SPENT
THREE HOURS

03:49.261 --> 03:51.396
LEARNING HOW
TO HIT A NAIL WITH A...

03:51.463 --> 03:53.664
I WANT TO SAY HAMMER.

03:53.732 --> 03:56.501
OH, I'M NOT SURE. I SLEPT
THROUGH MOST OF THAT.

03:56.568 --> 03:59.437
HEY, WHERE WAS
MR. DUGAN ANYWAY?

03:59.504 --> 04:01.272
OH, DIDN'T YOU HEAR?
HE'S NOT COMING BACK

04:01.339 --> 04:03.608

04:08.513 --> 04:10.915
THE OPENING OF THE NEW
HOOTERS HOTEL.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.085
WAIT A MINUTE.

04:14.152 --> 04:15.853
SO ALL THE SUITS
ARE IN MIAMI,

04:15.921 --> 04:18.322
AND ALL THE SECRETARIES

04:18.390 --> 04:20.625
YEAH. WELL, NO. DESIREE

04:28.350 --> 04:30.334
WELL-
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

04:30.402 --> 04:32.920
THEY'RE NOT HERE, SO THEY
DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

04:32.988 --> 04:35.456
WHY DON'T WE HAVE
OURSELVES A LITTLE FUN?

04:35.524 --> 04:38.726

04:40.179 --> 04:41.379
ANYBODY

04:41.447 --> 04:43.080
YOU LIVE IN A FREAKIN'
STUDIO APARTMENT

04:43.149 --> 04:44.782
THAT SMELLS
LIKE A PET STORE.

04:44.850 --> 04:46.367
SMELLS LIKE A PET STORE?

04:47.302 --> 04:49.253
A LITTLE BIT, SWEETIE.

04:49.321 --> 04:52.757
ANYWAY, I'M JUST SAYING WE

04:52.825 --> 04:55.176

04:55.244 --> 04:56.628
YES, AND WE WILL

04:56.696 --> 04:58.680

05:45.577 --> 05:47.244
YUH-HUH.

05:47.312 --> 05:49.197

PERIMETER LOOKS PRETTY GOOD,

06:00.709 --> 06:02.860
BUT, UH, KEEP
THOSE CHANNELS CLEAR.

06:02.928 --> 06:04.695

06:39.664 --> 06:41.365
I HAVEN'T HAD
A RUSH LIKE THIS,

06:41.433 --> 06:43.868
SINCE THEY PAID ME TO BE
IN THAT POLICE LINEUP.

06:43.936 --> 06:47.004
THAT LESBIAN ALMOST
GOT AWAY WITH MURDER.

06:47.072 --> 06:50.491
HEY, V.I.P.

07:01.036 --> 07:03.154
WELL, THAT'S

07:03.221 --> 07:04.689
OK, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.191
GUYS, I NEED YOU TO BOUNCE
A COUPLE OF DRUNKS

07:07.258 --> 07:08.793

07:08.860 --> 07:10.061
OH, AND, FELLAS, REMEMBER,

07:10.129 --> 07:13.397
YOU'RE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE
EXCESSIVE FORCE, YOU GOT IT?

GO FOR KEITH.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.501
OK, LET'S GO LOOK

07:17.569 --> 07:20.705
WAIT. WE HAVE TO GO DEAL

07:20.773 --> 07:22.423
WE SNUCK IN.

07:22.490 --> 07:25.860
AND I WANT TO BE ONE
OF THE DRUNKS, SO LET'S GO.

07:25.928 --> 07:27.478
WE HAVE TO PRETEND
LIKE WE WORK HERE,

07:27.546 --> 07:30.214
OR WE'LL GET THROWN OUT.
I WANT TO SEE HUEY LEWIS!

07:30.232 --> 07:32.533
WHATEVER, ALL RIGHT?
I WANT TO MEET SOME GROUPIES.

07:36.021 --> 07:39.690
OH-HO.

07:45.230 --> 07:47.631
YOU PROMISED TO SPEAK
TO DR. ZAIUS ABOUT ME.

07:47.699 --> 07:48.766

07:48.834 --> 07:51.252
YOU WERE GONNA HAVE
ANY FUN THIS WEEKEND, HUH?

07:51.320 --> 07:52.770
NO, SIREE.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.609

08:02.514 --> 08:04.115
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOOD, THANKS.

08:05.851 --> 08:08.286
WHERE AM I?
I'M IN HELL.

08:08.353 --> 08:09.653
DOUG SHOWED UP.

08:09.721 --> 08:11.455
THE FIRST TIME
IN 13 YEARS,

08:11.523 --> 08:13.024
HE DOES SOMETHING ROMANTIC.

08:13.091 --> 08:14.292
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:14.359 --> 08:16.060
YOU DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT
THE RINGLEADER, HONEY.

08:16.128 --> 08:18.830
I CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN.
I CAN TAKE IT DOWN.

08:18.897 --> 08:21.365
YEAH, YOU JUST WAIT FOR ME.
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

08:21.433 --> 08:22.834
OK.

08:22.901 --> 08:24.035
UHH...

08:24.102 --> 08:25.203
EVERYTHING OK?

08:26.604 --> 08:28.740
ACTUALLY, NO.

08:28.807 --> 08:31.442
BAD NEWS. UH...

08:31.510 --> 08:35.212
I HAVE ANOTHER
TRAINING SEMINAR TONIGHT.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.380
TONIGHT?

08:36.448 --> 08:37.614
IT'S ALMOST 8:00

08:37.682 --> 08:39.783
I KNOW. APPARENTLY,
THEY WANT THESE HOUSES

08:39.852 --> 08:41.852
BUILT "RIGHT."

08:43.054 --> 08:44.455
WE CANNOT
GET ANY MOMENTUM GOING

08:44.522 --> 08:45.789
WITH THESE MOVIES.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.792
CHARLTON HESTON HASN'T EVEN
TAKEN OFF HIS SHIRT YET.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.245
JUST MY LUCK.

08:51.363 --> 08:54.198
WELL,
WHEN YOU COME BACK,

08:54.266 --> 08:56.300
THIS'LL ALL BE
WAITING FOR YOU.

08:56.368 --> 08:57.634
KK-KK.

08:59.571 --> 09:01.705
ACTUALLY, UH, HONEY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:01.773 --> 09:04.225
UH, I'M GONNA BE GONE
MOST OF THE NIGHT TONIGHT,

09:04.293 --> 09:06.727
AND THEN I'M ON THE JOB
SITE ALL DAY TOMORROW.

09:06.795 --> 09:09.197
THIS IS JUST
NOT FAIR TO YOU.

09:09.264 --> 09:12.833
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

09:12.901 --> 09:14.752
WA-WANT YOU TO LEAVE?

09:14.820 --> 09:16.520
NO. NO, BUT I SURE AS SAM

09:16.588 --> 09:18.989
DON'T WANT YOU SITTING IN
THIS ROOM ALL BY YOURSELF

09:19.057 --> 09:21.058
WHILE I WORK
ALL DAY AND NIGHT.

09:21.126 --> 09:22.309
I DON'T KNOW.

09:22.377 --> 09:23.745
LIKE, THE WHOLE
DRIVE UP HERE

09:23.812 --> 09:25.446
WAS JUST...
FOR NOTHING.

09:25.514 --> 09:26.313
ALL FOR NO-

09:26.381 --> 09:28.966
NO, BABY, NO.
COME ON.

09:29.034 --> 09:31.069
JUST SEEING YOU
FOR A FEW MINUTES

09:31.136 --> 09:32.570
WAS AMAZING.

09:32.637 --> 09:35.573
JUST A LITTLE DOSE
OF DOUG WAS ALL I NEED.

09:36.942 --> 09:38.176
YEAH?
MM-HMM.

09:38.243 --> 09:40.695
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
A DOUBLE DOSE OF DOUG?

09:40.763 --> 09:41.696
HEH-HEH-HEH-HEH.

09:41.764 --> 09:44.948
RAIN CHECK, RAIN CHECK.

09:45.016 --> 09:47.451
COME ON, GIDDY UP, GIDDY UP
BEFORE YOU HIT THE TRAFFIC.

09:47.519 --> 09:48.820
UH, I, UH...

09:48.887 --> 09:51.322
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I-
WHERE AM I GONNA-

09:51.389 --> 09:52.590
NO, BABY.
YOU'LL DO GREAT.

09:52.658 --> 09:53.758
HERE'S YOUR LUGGAGE.

09:53.826 --> 09:54.926
I LOVE YOU.

09:54.994 --> 09:56.093
I DON'T HAVE MY SHOES.

09:56.161 --> 09:58.045
YOU WAIT THERE. I'LL GET 'EM.

09:58.113 --> 10:01.365
OK, BABY. THIS
HAS BEEN AMAZING,

10:01.433 --> 10:02.449
AND YOU'RE ACES, OK?

10:02.517 --> 10:04.102
LOVE YA. BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE.

10:16.248 --> 10:17.281
CAN I HELP YOU?

10:17.349 --> 10:19.183
AH, YES, MY WIFE
IS STAYING HERE

10:19.251 --> 10:20.852
AND I'D, AH, LIKE TO SURPRISE
HER WITH A MASSAGE TOMORROW.

10:20.919 --> 10:22.420
CERTAINLY, SIR.

10:22.521 --> 10:24.221
AND IF YOU SEND A GUY,

10:24.289 --> 10:25.957
NO BETTER LOOKING
THAN THIS, OKAY?

10:26.025 --> 10:28.125
AND YOUR WIFE'S NAME?

10:28.193 --> 10:30.278
OH, IT'S CARRIE HEFFERNAN.

10:32.463 --> 10:35.049
HMM, LOOKS LIKE SHE'S
ALREADY BOOKED FOR A MASSAGE.

10:35.117 --> 10:37.001
REALLY?

10:37.069 --> 10:38.886
TWO, ACTUALLY. SHE HAS
AN AVOCADO CITRUS WRAP

10:38.954 --> 10:43.390
AT 9:30 AND HOT STONE
THERAPY AT 3.

10:43.458 --> 10:46.160
YOU KNOW, YOU PROBABLY GOT
HER MIXED UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE

10:46.227 --> 10:48.195
BECAUSE I KNOW SHE'S
WORKING TOMORROW, SO.

10:48.263 --> 10:49.797
NO, I BOOKED THE
TREATMENTS MYSELF.

10:49.864 --> 10:52.800
AND I REMEMBER BECAUSE SHE
SAID IF ONE OF THE HOT STONES

10:52.867 --> 10:55.803
BURNED HER, SHE WOULD,
"TAKE ME DOWN."

10:59.624 --> 11:01.826
I KNOW. ALL RIGHT,
NOW LISTEN, YOU GUYS,

11:01.894 --> 11:03.661
WHEN WE HIT THE CLUB,
NOBODY PAYS FOR HER

11:03.729 --> 11:05.997
OWN DRINKS OR DANCES
WITH ANYONE OVER 25.

11:06.065 --> 11:07.965
OKAY.

11:08.033 --> 11:09.683
POP A FEW BUTTONS
ON THIS BLOUSE.

11:09.751 --> 11:11.318
THIS AIN'T CHURCH, HONEY.

11:11.386 --> 11:12.453
CARRIE, YOU'RE FUN
WHEN YOU'RE BAD.

11:12.521 --> 11:14.288
JUST GETTIN'
STARTED, HONEY.

11:24.900 --> 11:28.068
HUH, HUH, ALL RIGHT
HURRY BACK.

11:30.171 --> 11:32.607
HEY, MAN. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EYE?

11:32.674 --> 11:36.811
I HAD TO GIVE THE DRUMMER'S
MONKEY HIS ANTIBIOTICS.

11:36.878 --> 11:40.547
HEY, GREAT JOB
WITH MR. JINGLES.

11:40.615 --> 11:43.717
ANYWAY, NOW WE'VE GOT A
SITUATION WITH THE BASS PLAYER.

11:43.785 --> 11:46.187
HE WON'T COME OUT OF HIS
DRESSING ROOM UNTIL WE GET HIM

11:46.254 --> 11:48.488
7 BOYSENBERRY-SCENTED
CANDLES.

11:48.556 --> 11:52.293
HERE, PUT IT
ON HUEY'S CREDIT CARD.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.661
HE LIKES TO GET
THE MILES.

11:56.181 --> 11:57.881
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH THAT?

11:57.949 --> 12:00.584
OH, UH, WELL, THE KEYBOARD
PLAYER SAID HE

12:00.652 --> 12:03.420
WOULDN'T COME OUT OF HIS
ROOM UNTIL HE HAD SOME SHRIMP.

12:03.488 --> 12:07.224
HE LIKES IT HALF-EATEN.

12:07.292 --> 12:08.692
GO FOR KEITH.

12:08.760 --> 12:12.096
WELL, JAM SOMETHING IN IT
UNTIL I GET THERE.

12:13.565 --> 12:15.499
OKAY, YOUR TURN TO WORK.
GO GET THE CANDLES.

12:15.567 --> 12:16.984
COME ON, MAN.
THE DAUGHTER PASSED OUT.

12:17.135 --> 12:19.470
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE SOME REAL
HEADWAY WITH THE MOTHER.

12:19.537 --> 12:20.388
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

12:20.455 --> 12:21.672
HOW ABOUT THIS?

12:21.739 --> 12:24.324
TOMORROW NIGHT WE'LL COME
BACK FOR THE SECOND SHOW.

12:24.392 --> 12:25.459
I'LL TAKE CARE

12:25.527 --> 12:26.460
AND THE DRUNKS,

12:26.528 --> 12:27.628
AND YOU CAN JUST
HAVE A GREAT TIME.

12:27.696 --> 12:28.663

THOSE FIREMEN BOUGHT US?

12:32.968 --> 12:36.370
I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL ASK THEM.

12:36.438 --> 12:38.005
SHOULD I NOT HAVE GIVEN
THEM MY ROOM KEY?

12:39.407 --> 12:40.574
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

12:40.642 --> 12:41.608
YEAH.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.695
OKAY, SO WE'LL MEET

13:10.372 --> 13:13.807
HEY, BABY. WHAT ARE

13:19.948 --> 13:21.648
BUT I SAID YOU CAN GO.

13:21.716 --> 13:24.135
HEY, I'VE BEEN
MARRIED A WHILE

13:58.987 --> 14:00.054
HEY SLEEPY HEAD.

14:00.122 --> 14:02.290

OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

14:03.959 --> 14:05.659

14:09.163 --> 14:10.831
HEY, DO YOU HAVE
ANY ASPIRIN?

14:10.899 --> 14:13.067

14:13.135 --> 14:15.268

IS FOR CHARITY, RIGHT?

14:15.336 --> 14:17.437
I'M DOING THIS OUT OF THE
GOODNESS OF MY HEART.

14:17.505 --> 14:18.306

THAT SPACKLE IN YOUR HAIR

14:27.715 --> 14:30.301
IS GONNA COME OUT WITH
A LITTLE BIT OF TURPENTINE.

14:30.368 --> 14:31.902
THANK YOU, HONEY.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.737
OKAY. AND BY THE WAY, WE'RE
PUTTING UP THE DRY-WALL NOW

14:33.805 --> 14:35.239
SO I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO HOLD IT STEADY WHILE I...

14:35.306 --> 14:36.690
LOCK HER DOWN.

14:36.758 --> 14:37.959
HEY, WHILE I GOT THIS OUT

14:38.026 --> 14:40.127
WHY DON'T I CHECK OUT
YOUR CHOPPERS, HUH?

14:40.195 --> 14:41.278
DOUG, STOP.

14:41.345 --> 14:42.930
SOMEBODY HAS NOT
BEEN FLOSSING.

14:42.998 --> 14:45.048
PLEASE, I HAVE
A HEADACHE.

14:45.116 --> 14:47.785
OH, YOU HAVE A HEADACHE.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

14:47.852 --> 14:49.853
KNOW WHAT'LL MAKE YOU
PROBABLY FEEL BETTER?

14:49.921 --> 14:52.355
YOUR HOT STONE
MASSAGE AT 3:00.

14:52.423 --> 14:55.609
WHAT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.094
OH, PLEASE.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

14:57.161 --> 14:58.361
THE BOOZE AND THE DANCING.

14:58.429 --> 15:01.398
THE SMOKING
IN A NONSMOKING ROOM, YEAH.

15:01.466 --> 15:02.733
DAMN IT.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.135
YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

15:04.202 --> 15:06.137
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, DOUG,
I'VE BEEN WORKING HARD

15:06.204 --> 15:07.738
OKAY, I JUST WANTED
A WEEKEND TO LET LOOSE.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.373
SO YOU LIE
TO YOUR HUSBAND?

15:09.440 --> 15:11.441
JUST TO GO WILD
IN HARTFORD?

15:11.509 --> 15:13.761
OKAY, LOOK, I LIED
TO YOU, OKAY, I AM SORRY.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.763
BUT THAT WAS ONCE,
YOU LIE TO ME ALL THE TIME.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.765
THAT'S RIGHT, DIFFERENCE
IS, I'M GOOD AT IT.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.267
YOUR LIES ARE
LIKE TISSUE PAPER.

15:20.335 --> 15:23.838
MINE ARE LIKE THAT HOUSE,
BUILT ON A SOLID FOUNDATION.

15:23.905 --> 15:26.506
ALTHOUGH THAT STAIRCASE I
DON'T THINK IS MY BEST WORK.

15:26.574 --> 15:29.176
HEY CARRIE, WE'RE
WAITING FOR THAT HOT TAR.

15:29.244 --> 15:31.928
OKAY, COMING.

15:40.788 --> 15:43.824
YEAH, I DON'T, UH,
JUST WORK SECURITY.

15:43.892 --> 15:47.794
MY MAIN GIG IS HIRING THE
GIRLS TO BE IN THE VIDEOS.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.529
OH, HEY, BUDDY,
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?

15:49.597 --> 15:51.615
WHERE HAVE I BEEN?
I'VE BEEN ELBOW DEEP

15:51.683 --> 15:52.816
IN HUEY LEWIS' TOILET.

15:52.884 --> 15:55.753
WHOA, YOU ARE A FAN.

15:55.821 --> 15:57.121
HEY LISTEN, I'M NOT
MISSING TONIGHT'S SHOW.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.990
YOU'RE ON THE CLOCK.

16:00.058 --> 16:02.543
HEY GUYS, SUPER JOB
ON THE TOILET.

16:02.611 --> 16:04.879
HUEY ACTUALLY USED
THE WORD IMMACULATE.

16:04.946 --> 16:08.181
WELL, THANKS, KEITH, BUT
THAT'S NOT WHY I DO IT.

16:08.249 --> 16:09.683
BUT IT'S NICE TO HEAR.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.652
WAIT, NO, NO, LISTEN,
I CLEANED THE TOILET

16:11.720 --> 16:14.088
AND I RE-VAMPED
THE CHECK-IN PROCEDURE.

16:14.155 --> 16:16.590
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,
HE DOESN'T EVEN WORK HERE.

16:16.657 --> 16:17.508
WHAT?

16:17.575 --> 16:18.592
YEAH, HE'S A PHONY.

16:18.659 --> 16:20.928
HE GOT THAT JACKET
FROM HIS COUSIN.

16:20.995 --> 16:25.966
BARRY, THIS GUY'S GONE, AND
REMEMBER, NO EXCESSIVE FORCE.

16:28.519 --> 16:30.988
HEY, WE'RE STILL ON FOR
SATURDAY THOUGH, RIGHT?

16:33.825 --> 16:35.659
EXCUSE ME.

16:35.727 --> 16:38.328
OH MY GOD, HUEY LEWIS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:38.396 --> 16:39.546
IT'S MY CONCERT.

16:39.614 --> 16:41.765
OH, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

16:41.832 --> 16:43.433
I HAVE ALL OF YOUR ALBUMS.

16:43.501 --> 16:45.569
I COULD PROBABLY SING
EVERY ONE OF YOUR SONGS.

16:45.620 --> 16:46.853
YEAH, WELL PLEASE DON'T.

16:46.921 --> 16:48.372
NOW LISTEN, I SAW WHAT
YOU DID OVER THERE.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.390
I KNOW, CAN YOU
BELIEVE THAT GUY?

16:50.459 --> 16:52.693
YOU RATTED OUT YOUR FRIEND,
AND WHERE I COME FROM...

16:52.761 --> 16:53.994
THE BAY AREA.

16:54.061 --> 16:56.780
YEAH, BACK THERE,
THAT MAKES YOU A RAT.

16:56.848 --> 16:58.049
AND WE DON'T LIKE RATS.

16:58.116 --> 17:00.784
SO BEAT IT, BEFORE THE NEWS
AND I KICK YOUR ASS.

17:00.852 --> 17:02.986
BUT, NO WAIT...

17:03.055 --> 17:04.371
HUEY, LISTEN,
I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

17:04.439 --> 17:06.772
I CLEANED YOUR TOILETS
THE WAY YOU LIKE.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.876
HUEY LEWIS IS GONNA KICK
MY ASS. PRETTY-

17:17.402 --> 17:19.169
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MAKE YOUR
APPEARANCE WITH MR. DUGAN

17:19.237 --> 17:20.404
AND GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

17:20.471 --> 17:22.339
ALL RIGHT, FINE, BUT FOR
THE NEXT TWENTY MINUTES

17:22.406 --> 17:24.340
CAN YOU JUST PRETEND THAT
YOU'RE HAPPILY MARRIED?

17:24.409 --> 17:26.492
OKAY, HOW'S THIS?

17:26.560 --> 17:28.946
ALL RIGHT, STOP IT,
HE'S COMING, JUST STOP.

17:28.997 --> 17:32.299
HEY GUYS, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR ALL THE HARD WORK.

17:32.367 --> 17:35.669
THE LARKIN FAMILY
APPRECIATES IT AND SO DO I.

17:35.736 --> 17:37.071
WELL DOUG AND I SHOULD BE
THANKING YOU FOR...

17:37.138 --> 17:39.756
HEY GUYS, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR ALL THE HARD WORK.

17:39.824 --> 17:42.342
THE LARKIN FAMILY
APPRECIATES IT AND SO DO I.

17:42.410 --> 17:43.276
CAN WE GO NOW?

17:43.428 --> 17:44.728
IN A MINUTE, DOUG.

17:44.796 --> 17:46.396
IF I COULD HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?

17:46.464 --> 17:49.666
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE MAN
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THIS.

17:49.734 --> 17:54.405
OUR WONDERFUL BOSS,
MR. ANDREW DUGAN.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.691
THANK YOU, DESIREE.

17:59.494 --> 18:01.661
BUILDING THIS HOME WAS AN
AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT

18:01.729 --> 18:04.331
BUT, IT'S JUST
THE BEGINNING.

18:04.399 --> 18:06.767
THAT'S WHERE THE
GIVING TREE COMES IN.

18:06.834 --> 18:08.702
IF YOU WANT TO HELP
SOME MORE, TAKE A LEAF.

18:08.770 --> 18:13.840
EACH LEAF HAS A HOUSEHOLD ITEM
YOU CAN BUY FOR THE LARKINS.

18:13.908 --> 18:18.328
ALL THAT'S LEFT FOR THE LARKINS
TO SUPPLY, IS THE LOVE.

18:19.981 --> 18:21.081
A GIVING TREE, HUH?

18:21.148 --> 18:23.049
TOO BAD THEY DON'T HAVE
A TAKING TREE FOR YOU.

18:23.117 --> 18:27.137
INSTEAD OF HELPING, YOU'RE GOING
COYOTE UGLY WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

18:27.205 --> 18:29.006
PLEASE, LIKE
YOU'RE SO NICE?

18:29.074 --> 18:31.475
THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU
DID THIS WAS TO SPITE ME.

18:31.542 --> 18:34.428
AT LEAST MY SPITE BUILDS.
YOUR SPITE ONLY DESTROYS.

18:34.496 --> 18:37.231
OH, COME ON, I'M 10 TIMES
MORE GENEROUS THAN YOU ARE.

18:37.298 --> 18:38.265
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

18:38.333 --> 18:39.333
YEAH, I AM SERIOUS.

18:39.401 --> 18:40.283
OH PLEASE, COME ON.

18:40.318 --> 18:42.903
PLEASE, YOU BROTHER.
YEAH, RIGHT.

18:42.971 --> 18:45.405
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS, I'M
GONNA BUY THE LARKINS

18:45.473 --> 18:46.539
SOMETHING SO
CHOKE ON THAT.

18:46.607 --> 18:48.008
I'LL GET THEM TWO
WISHES RIGHT THERE.

18:48.076 --> 18:49.576
I'LL TAKE THE WHOLE
FRIGGIN' BRANCH, DOUG.

18:49.643 --> 18:52.645
YOU DON'T SCARE ME, MAN.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.249
OH, MY, I GET TO BUY
THEM A WASHER-DRYER.

19:00.355 --> 19:02.089
WASHER-DRYER, I THOUGHT
IT WAS LITTLE STUFF

19:02.156 --> 19:04.458
LIKE AN ICE CREAM SCOOPER.

19:04.526 --> 19:07.127
WHAT DID WE GET
OURSELVES INTO HERE?

19:07.195 --> 19:09.029
COME HERE,
COME HERE.

19:10.598 --> 19:12.316
WHAT DOES YOURS SAY?

19:12.384 --> 19:16.637
IT SAYS A...
A TOASTER.

19:16.704 --> 19:17.871
OH, THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

19:17.939 --> 19:21.308
AND A RIDING MOWER.

19:21.376 --> 19:22.842
WHAT?

19:22.911 --> 19:26.113
WITH SATELLITE RADIO,
THIS IS CRAZY.

19:26.180 --> 19:30.901
OH MY GOD, I HAVE TO GET A
LAPTOP AND A SLEEPER SOFA.

19:30.968 --> 19:32.736
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

19:32.803 --> 19:34.637
WE'RE GONNA PUT THEM BACK,
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

19:34.705 --> 19:36.106
WE CAN'T PUT THEM BACK,
PEOPLE WILL SEE YOU.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.241
CREATE A DISTRACTION.

19:37.308 --> 19:38.275
HOW?

19:38.343 --> 19:39.343
TAKE YOUR TOP DOWN.
