01:04.800 --> 01:06.450
That was a bomb.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.650
No word as to whether it was an IED
or a specific car bomb.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.900
Over 10 fatalities reported.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.086
Sources within ISAF suggest
that ISI may be involved.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.761
Did these phones just go down
or did that fucker hang up on me?

01:29.160 --> 01:32.243
Good thing that X was bodgy
or I'd be flying right now!

01:38.520 --> 01:40.124
I can't hear you, honey.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.209
I need to talk to Ed Faber.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.980
Well, then who is fronting the show?

01:48.080 --> 01:49.420
I can't hear you!

01:49.520 --> 01:52.364
Hey, that's my ass! Do you have a mother?

01:52.640 --> 01:54.340
Don't put your ass on my hand!

01:54.440 --> 01:56.700
Shut up, donkey pussy!

01:56.800 --> 01:58.404
Whore! Dog-washer!

01:58.520 --> 01:59.780
My cock in your ear!

01:59.880 --> 02:01.180
My cock in your ear! I shit on your lips!

02:01.280 --> 02:02.820
Eat a fart!

02:02.920 --> 02:04.100
Hello!

02:04.200 --> 02:05.201
Fu...

02:19.760 --> 02:23.460
Listen up. Iraq Two is happening.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.380
The network is stretched thin.
All our talent is going there.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.802
We need people, any people,
to fill the void in Afghanistan.

02:29.920 --> 02:34.968
And you folks here are all the unmarried,
childless personnel in this bureau.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.140
For those of you who are
behind the scenes, there are

02:43.240 --> 02:46.340
opportunities to be on camera.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.500
Kim, are you going to be joining in?

02:49.600 --> 02:51.762
The travel or the crying?

02:52.680 --> 02:55.140
Hopefully, the travel.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.860
I'll think about it.

02:56.960 --> 03:01.700
The success of Operation Mongoose has
overshadowed the real lesson to be learned,

03:01.800 --> 03:05.009
that the Taliban are far from vanquished.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.820
And as the drums of war
beat ever louder in Iraq,

03:07.920 --> 03:12.323
the NATO mission in Afghanistan
grows increasingly uncertain.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.220
Tanya Vanderpoel, outside
Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan,

03:19.320 --> 03:20.970
VBC World News.

03:23.960 --> 03:24.961
Hey.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.300
I got you! Hey.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.980
When do you get back from Houston?

03:30.080 --> 03:32.321
I think on Tuesday. Why?

03:32.440 --> 03:36.500
Because I'm going
to Afghanistan on Tuesday.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.540
You're going to Afghanistan on Tuesday?

03:39.640 --> 03:40.860
Yeah.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.820
But you write news copy.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.340
Wait. For how long?

03:44.440 --> 03:47.330
- Like, three months.
- What?

03:53.160 --> 03:54.321
Kim!

03:56.000 --> 03:57.161
Hey!

03:58.640 --> 04:00.404
I can't believe this worked out!

04:01.160 --> 04:03.845
Hey, you want to have a quickie
on the changing table in the bathroom?

04:04.320 --> 04:07.324
Yeah, I don't think I could get it up
with that little koala looking at me.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.580
Also, they're boarding already.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.220
Hey, don't worry. Just go. Go, go, go.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.620
Shoot, I... I copied a key for you, so...

04:15.720 --> 04:16.880
Plants, mail.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.764
- Anything else I'm forgetting?
- I think that's it.

04:19.640 --> 04:20.579
This is crazy.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.460
Listen, I think it's impressive.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.780
Start a new career?

04:23.880 --> 04:25.260
It's gonna be great.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.900
And listen, in three months...

04:28.000 --> 04:29.340
"I'll be back."

04:29.440 --> 04:30.740
No, that's terrible! No.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.808
Don't remember me like that. No.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.048
Bye. Okay. Okay.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.260
It's not my job. I'm a producer.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.820
General news. Enron.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.940
These coalminers in Pennsylvania,
but you probably didn't see that.

04:46.040 --> 04:50.100
'Cause we got two wars going on now,
so, I know how to set up a BGAN

04:50.200 --> 04:51.860
and no one will sue if I die

04:51.960 --> 04:55.780
so I got an expedited visa,
like, two days ago,

04:55.880 --> 04:58.724
and I guess now I'm a war reporter.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.529
Shit dick!

05:03.920 --> 05:05.251
Corkscrew landing.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.443
In case a missile is fired
at the aircraft!

05:10.760 --> 05:13.764
Kabul International Airport.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.281
K. I.A.! "Killed In Action."

05:17.200 --> 05:20.283
Once again,
we thank you for flying with us.

05:30.920 --> 05:31.967
Sorry.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.806
Sorry.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.481
Shit.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.847
No, thank you. No, thank you.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.921
Miss Baker?

05:45.760 --> 05:47.091
I am Fahim.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.500
Fahim, hi! Pleased to meet you.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.170
The car is over here and we go.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.361
Cover your head, shameless whore!

05:55.680 --> 05:58.445
She says... "Welcome to Afghanistan."

05:59.120 --> 06:00.340
Okay, let's go.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.620
Here is your local mobile.
The number is on the back.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.500
Yeah, I ordered some money
last week. Still in the post.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.284
- I'll fix you up next week.
- Okay.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.171
Yes, the air here
takes some getting used to.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.100
It's quite polluted with feces.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.340
Here she is! How are you, Kim?

06:15.440 --> 06:17.363
Welcome to the Stan. My name's Nic.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.860
I'll be doing your security.
I'll take your bag.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.611
Fahim. The police are giving
me shit for parking here.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.860
They just want money.

06:23.960 --> 06:28.020
Wait, oh, no. Do you need money?
Because the network gave me money.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.282
- No, keep that on you!
- No, no, no! Kim, please!

06:36.480 --> 06:38.608
Piss off, that's it! That's it! Hey! Hey!

06:39.520 --> 06:41.682
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Piss off!

06:54.720 --> 06:56.780
Remember that we are at altitude here,

06:56.880 --> 06:59.140
so drink plenty of water
while you acclimatize.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.900
Where did you learn English?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.367
At medical school. I was a doctor.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.620
Listen, rest up tonight.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.166
Tomorrow, I'll drive you
to the base for your embed.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.369
And just one bag, but make sure
you pack extra socks and knickers.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.530
That's like, it's like "panties," yeah?

07:18.640 --> 07:20.780
So, you've been embedded before, then?

07:20.880 --> 07:24.260
Not really. We all did
hostile-zone training in 2001.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.409
They taught us to open our
mouths if we get mortared...

07:27.880 --> 07:29.450
That kind of stuff.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.450
Okay.

07:41.240 --> 07:42.446
G'day, Qadar.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.566
The feces smell all the way to here.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.322
Your room, Kim, is upstairs.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.380
Yeah, they're bloody addicted.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.660
That one melted a laptop
downloading porno.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.780
Jaweed, yes, he likes
to watch men with donkeys.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.405
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.329
It's unfortunate.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.602
Kim, this is Tall Brian.

08:25.720 --> 08:26.860
Brian Hooper. Tall Brian.

08:26.960 --> 08:27.980
- Hi.
- I'm your shooter.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.971
So, is there another Brian around here
somewhere that you're taller than?

08:32.840 --> 08:34.604
Short Brian. Works for Reuters.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.167
Couldn't one of you just be "Brian"?

08:37.960 --> 08:40.260
Fair enough. Didn't think of that.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.929
Also Short Brian's dead.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.801
- Fuck. Really?
- Yes.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.564
Anyway, welcome to the Fun House.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.530
Home sweet home.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.170
This is your room.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.130
Is there a shower?

09:33.520 --> 09:38.050
A nation accustomed to war
once again seeks a return to normality.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.361
And nothing symbolizes that
effort more than this place,

09:43.200 --> 09:44.780
the Kabul Zoo.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.660
No, he didn't. The zoo?

09:46.760 --> 09:49.491
- Go back to Wapping.
- You fucking tourist!

09:51.120 --> 09:53.460
Shit. Sorry.
I'm trying to find the shower?

09:53.560 --> 09:54.891
You're the new girl.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.126
My God. Kim Baker.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.004
Just got here from New York.

10:00.120 --> 10:04.180
I'm Tanya. Oh, my God, it's so nice
to have another woman in the house!

10:04.280 --> 10:06.540
I love that lippy color. What is that?

10:06.640 --> 10:07.940
No, they're just really chapped.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.100
You poor thing. Can I get you anything?

10:11.200 --> 10:15.140
I'm sorry, I'm freaking out
because I saw your

10:15.240 --> 10:18.562
special about your embed in
Korengal, and it was amazing.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.900
Thank you. That's so sweet.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.401
- Where's the shower?
- Yes. This way.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.048
Can I ask a favor, Kim?

10:27.160 --> 10:29.420
- And absolutely feel free to say no.
- Yeah, sure.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.700
I hate to even bring it up.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.140
- I feel so rude even asking this.
- No, it's fine.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.811
Can I fuck your security guys?

10:36.080 --> 10:37.923
What?

10:38.840 --> 10:40.500
By all means, yeah.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.580
Yeah? I mean, I wouldn't ask,
it's just that for some reason,

10:43.680 --> 10:45.820
the VBC use an American contractor

10:45.920 --> 10:49.780
and, I mean, no offense, but they're
all, like, goatees and "fat-strong".

10:49.880 --> 10:52.220
You know? But the Aussies
and Kiwis are so hot.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.300
Right. I get it. Be my guest.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.020
You sure?
Don't just say that to be polite.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.340
No, I wouldn't. I'm not.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.647
Even Nic? You don't want Nic for yourself?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.300
Nic?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.926
No. I don't. No.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.260
That's... No, that would never happen.
So you're good.

11:06.360 --> 11:10.100
Hey! No, Kim, don't say that.
You could have Nic.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.283
In Afghanistan,
you're a serious piece of ass.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.940
Thank you. That's nice.

11:15.040 --> 11:19.564
Because you're what, I mean, you're like,
a seven, a six or seven in New York?

11:19.760 --> 11:22.300
Here, you're a nine.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.420
Borderline ten.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.124
It's called "Kabul Cute."

11:27.920 --> 11:29.809
What are you here, like a 15?

11:31.560 --> 11:32.607
Yeah.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.940
The thing is, I have a very
serious boyfriend at home,

11:38.040 --> 11:39.540
so, you're good.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.940
All right, well, come talk
to me in two months

11:41.040 --> 11:43.725
when your pussy's eating your leg.
Shower's that way.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.900
How you doing?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.526
It's bananas here. It's...

11:58.720 --> 12:01.300
My nose is running.
There's shit in the air,

12:01.400 --> 12:02.740
literally.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.001
And

12:04.680 --> 12:06.648
I don't think I can do this.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.205
Do what?

12:08.680 --> 12:09.681
Kim?

12:10.880 --> 12:12.460
I don't think I can do this.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.562
Can you see... I don't... Hello?

12:15.720 --> 12:16.721
Shit.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.860
I'm sorry, Colonel,
I can't accept gifts as a journalist.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.140
Okay.

12:37.240 --> 12:41.460
So lodging, transport, chow
and protection, that's all you can accept?

12:41.560 --> 12:43.220
I'll do my best to stay objective.

12:43.320 --> 12:46.369
I don't care if you can do your job.
I care if my men can.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.689
Are you familiar with the term
"four-ten-four", Miss Baker?

12:49.840 --> 12:51.205
I am not, Colonel.

12:51.360 --> 12:56.020
It refers to women who are fours back
home become tens when they ship out

12:56.120 --> 12:59.044
and when they're back stateside,
they become fours again.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.566
Are you saying I'm a four?

13:00.920 --> 13:04.402
I'm saying you carry
an orange fucking backpack.

13:05.520 --> 13:09.300
I've seen people with actual experience
make bad decisions here.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.020
So while you're outside
the wire with my men,

13:12.120 --> 13:14.487
you will in no way
distract them, understood?

13:15.720 --> 13:17.900
Are you asking me not
to sleep with your soldiers?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.207
No, not "soldiers". Marines.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.769
You're not here to sleep with or perform
jobs of any type on my Marines.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.291
Clear copy, Miss Baker?

13:27.200 --> 13:28.850
- Copy that.
- Good.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.971
We'll get you out to a FOB
as soon as we find a ride for you.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.243
In the meantime, Captain Stern here
will see to it that you get a wet hootch.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.241
A what?

13:37.680 --> 13:39.250
It's a tent with a shower.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.580
Unless you'd prefer a dry hootch.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.170
I would not, sir.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.561
Sorry.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.926
Could you just...
State your name and rank?

14:48.320 --> 14:50.300
Gunnery Sergeant Clinton J. Hurd.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.940
All right. Dang it!

14:53.040 --> 14:57.409
So, do you believe the Afghani people
are happy about our presence here?

14:57.640 --> 14:59.380
No, Afghans are the people.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.700
Afghanis is the currency.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.580
That's right. I knew that. Thank you.

15:04.680 --> 15:06.728
What do you believe
your mission to be here?

15:06.840 --> 15:08.140
Ma'am, you got a sticker on your pants.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.322
It's bugging the shit out of me. Ma'am...

15:11.440 --> 15:12.380
Fahim.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.300
What inspired you to enlist originally?

15:14.400 --> 15:19.140
I'm a big fan of the movie Predator
with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.651
We're the same height.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.740
Do you think the war in Iraq
has affected your resources here?

15:24.840 --> 15:27.605
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm not authorized
to answer that question.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.460
I'd say we're both on the
wrong side of Persia, ma'am.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.900
Iraq is where you get some right now.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.180
Here just has shit all.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.860
Are you guys getting
outside the wire much?

15:37.960 --> 15:40.020
Yes, ma'am. Most days.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.740
You know, we help out with
community projects and all.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.002
And wells.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.460
And sometimes at night
we shoot the big gun,

15:48.560 --> 15:50.608
- but, you know, it's quiet here.
- Jesus!

15:50.720 --> 15:53.100
We don't wear IBAs on the FOB.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.100
I don't even chamber a round
in my weapon anymore, because,

15:56.200 --> 15:59.860
you know, I figure accidental discharge
is scarier than the Taliban.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.460
With Iraq, do you feel like people
have forgotten about Afghanistan?

16:03.560 --> 16:05.180
Well...

16:05.280 --> 16:08.124
Yes, ma'am. I'd say that
surely is the word for it.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.780
This here's a forgotten war.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.486
It's capital F, capital W.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.325
What's your... Your name and rank?

16:18.200 --> 16:21.807
I'm Lance Corporal Coughlin,
India Company 3-5.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.481
Thank you.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.322
Kim. Your hair.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.285
Thanks, Fahim.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.410
You really are a fixer.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.685
Moon's out.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.001
It's beautiful.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.411
Suck my dick!

17:01.760 --> 17:02.820
What does that mean?

17:02.920 --> 17:06.288
It means, "What a terrible event!"

17:06.400 --> 17:07.420
Miss Baker.

17:07.520 --> 17:10.940
Colonel Hollanek is coming to Norton
tomorrow to check on some of our PRT work.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.099
And you and your crew
are clear to tag along.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.885
- Great, thanks.
- Rolls out at zero-six.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.962
- That's 6:00 a.m.
- I know that, yeah.

17:20.119 --> 17:21.201
Fire!

17:23.000 --> 17:25.320
Come on, let's go!
Get this shit together! We gotta move!

17:25.440 --> 17:27.180
Fucking hands out of your pockets!

17:27.280 --> 17:28.805
You think you're in the fucking Army?

17:32.160 --> 17:33.207
What is this?

17:33.320 --> 17:34.860
That's my supplies. Camera stuff.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.700
You fucking kidding me?

17:36.800 --> 17:40.740
This is an orange ruck.
No, ma'am. Not on my vehicle.

17:40.840 --> 17:44.260
The girl at the North Face store
said it was, like, military grade.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.940
Well, where are you gonna hide it?
Inside a fucking sunset?

17:47.040 --> 17:50.380
I mean, even the Dutch Army
don't wear orange.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.845
Fix it.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.580
How do I fix it?

17:54.680 --> 17:55.886
Rapono!

18:12.800 --> 18:14.420
Got to stay hydrated, ma'am.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.727
Coughlin. I didn't recognize you.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.340
That's 'cause I'm in warrior mode.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.204
It makes me taller.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.842
Enjoy the ride, ma'am.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.740
I'm dying to know who blew up my well.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.171
Working on it, Colonel.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.289
That was a nice fucking well, Corporal.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.041
What'd he say?

19:06.600 --> 19:08.060
What's that mean?

19:08.160 --> 19:10.083
He wants to know if you are the Russians.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.091
The Russians?

19:14.200 --> 19:15.804
No!

19:15.920 --> 19:18.300
No, sir. That was 20 years ago.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.765
And we're here to help.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.809
And I'm black.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.766
The Russians are blacks now.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.646
If we fix the well, you can't blow it up.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.980
Kim, I was talking to some
of the younger men.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.340
They say the Taliban came at night.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.761
I don't care. No. I drank
too much water and I have to pee.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.764
Stop. Stop. I am engaged to be married.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.020
Okay, Fahim,
I know you like your women to be, like,

19:50.120 --> 19:52.380
beautiful, mysterious IKEA bags, okay?

19:52.480 --> 19:55.563
But we urinate, Doctor.
Out of our vaginas.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.540
You think you urinate out the...

19:58.640 --> 20:00.020
No. I know it's a separate thing!

20:00.120 --> 20:01.340
God! Just please help me.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.260
There is nowhere for you to go.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.060
I cannot ask these men about this.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.700
And I'm not allowed to talk to the women.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.963
Fine. Forget it. I'll hold it.
Women are tough, right?

20:19.080 --> 20:20.366
Are you okay, ma'am?

20:22.120 --> 20:23.849
Gosh, damn it, man. This is a new one.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.729
I was cursing your name at 0-stupid-30,
but I'm glad I came out today.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.740
Would you not have gone
on patrol today if I weren't here?

20:31.840 --> 20:33.842
No, I'd be back in Norton filling HESCOs.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.140
Copy that.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.260
We're still 5 mikes.
It must be one hairy dump.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.647
No, I'm just getting my pants on.
Damn it, Sergeant Hurd.

20:40.760 --> 20:41.980
Whatever.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.300
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Marine!

20:44.400 --> 20:46.084
Make a hole, Baker.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.605
Move out!

21:24.160 --> 21:25.660
Why are we stopping?

21:25.760 --> 21:27.380
The lead vehicle bottomed out.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.450
Okay! Heads on a swivel!

21:31.440 --> 21:33.044
Didn't we come this way?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.483
We most surely did.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.562
- Contact left!
- Stay in the vehicle!

21:44.840 --> 21:48.367
Shit! Hot! Hot bullet things!

21:52.760 --> 21:55.604
Kim, don't get out of the car! Kim!

22:02.040 --> 22:04.460
Get down behind the engine block!

22:04.560 --> 22:06.369
Stay there! Stay there!

22:08.040 --> 22:09.140
Kim.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.571
Get back in the car!

22:21.200 --> 22:23.248
No, please, Kim!

22:38.600 --> 22:40.420
Ma'am, I asked you to stay put!

22:40.520 --> 22:42.010
Those assholes tried to shoot us!

22:43.640 --> 22:44.721
Jesus!

22:44.840 --> 22:46.860
You have got to be shitting me!

22:46.960 --> 22:50.140
You just shot a Javelin at a fucking car!

22:50.240 --> 22:52.620
That's an $80,000 piece of ordnance!

22:52.720 --> 22:55.780
Can any of you geniuses
tell me the Kelley Blue Book value

22:55.880 --> 22:58.724
of a 1989 Toyota pickup?

23:09.960 --> 23:13.169
Oorah, Baker. Get some.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.660
I hope you got all that on film, ma'am.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.900
'Cause that right there,
that's what we do best.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.380
Hearts and minds.

23:24.480 --> 23:27.324
That's the two best places
to shoot somebody.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.460
What?

23:32.560 --> 23:34.220
I told you to stay in the car.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.288
Okay, I'll get back in the car.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.681
The Marines don't have
much to say about Iraq.

23:40.160 --> 23:43.460
Their mantra is that they are
focused on doing the job here.

23:43.560 --> 23:48.900
And even though, as we saw firsthand,
attacks against coalition forces are up,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.129
Corporal Coughlin told me earlier
that he is still not planning

23:52.240 --> 23:55.540
to lock and load his weapon
when he is out on patrol.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.086
Our own Kim Baker reporting for us live.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.201
Welcome!

24:05.560 --> 24:08.370
Wow, good job, Kim! Ruthless!

24:10.840 --> 24:13.923
Bitch, we are going out tonight!

24:41.480 --> 24:43.244
It's okay. It's okay. Here.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.127
It's okay. It's all right.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.206
Why don't I know who you are?

25:01.720 --> 25:04.780
You're what, like, 42?

25:04.880 --> 25:05.860
Sold.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.291
Why have I never heard of you?

25:07.400 --> 25:10.740
Yeah, I haven't done
a lot of overseas reporting.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.049
I've done mostly domestic reportage.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.420
"Reportage"?

25:16.520 --> 25:19.364
Domestic reportage.

25:19.640 --> 25:22.740
Look, everyone in the Kabubble
is full of shit. It's okay.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.020
Half the accents are fake.

25:24.120 --> 25:28.125
The whole "I'm ex-Special Forces"
wankers are flat out lying.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.726
"Reportage"?

25:32.280 --> 25:34.980
Oh, Christ, what is this?

25:35.080 --> 25:36.780
I really shouldn't have
my back to the door.

25:36.880 --> 25:41.091
It's bad tradecraft, but it's worth it
to talk to you two ladies.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.085
Fuck off.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.765
You got it.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.290
Champagne?

25:49.400 --> 25:50.811
Thank you.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.460
Finish this, and then we'll go meet
some friends in Wazir Akbar Khan.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.260
And I am warning you now,
do not sleep with Iain.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.328
- Who is Iain?
- He's a proper asshole.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.408
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.081
Is that a cab?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.540
Is your full name Shakira?

26:09.640 --> 26:12.020
'Cause I thought it was
a Colombian nickname.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.220
Why would you think that?

26:13.320 --> 26:14.380
Because of the singer.

26:14.480 --> 26:18.980
No, I know. I'm kidding.
No, it's Arabic for "thankful."

26:19.080 --> 26:20.923
Kim is American for "white lady".

26:21.920 --> 26:24.540
Actually, "Kim" means "who" in Turkish.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.180
"Who's that white lady?"

26:26.280 --> 26:27.700
It's Kim.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.280
That's so you can remember my name.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.086
So... This is Iain. Iain, Kim.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.962
Kim. Kim. Kim. Kim, nice work.

26:38.320 --> 26:41.140
You sit next to the only two women
in a country the size of Texas

26:41.240 --> 26:43.447
that remind a man that you're
really only okay looking.

26:44.800 --> 26:48.580
Well, she said you were an asshole,
but that's really above and beyond.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.740
- Who said that?
- Tanya.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.220
No. No. No. I don't think so.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.100
A lot of women find me very charming, Kim.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.820
- No, not biological women.
- Oh, really?

26:55.920 --> 26:59.900
Women who think that an accent is
the same thing as a personality, maybe.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.527
Nae, haud yer wheesht.
Go bile yer heid, ya wee bampot.

27:04.840 --> 27:08.003
I bet you're wetter than a submarine
with screen doors now.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.100
I got that from a pickup book.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.690
- Jesus.
- Oh, yeah.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.420
So what's your deal?

27:15.520 --> 27:18.740
You got chucked over by some guy
so you think, "Forget him.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.820
"I'm gonna go discover
the wonders of the East,

27:20.920 --> 27:23.220
"and I'm gonna fuck a Scottish guy
and write a book."

27:23.320 --> 27:24.924
I'm Scottish, by the way.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.846
Cheers.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.900
- Cheers.
- Salud.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.843
- Cheers.
- To Kim!

27:42.120 --> 27:45.329
- Is this your first night out?
- Yes.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.124
It is, actually.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.460
That little bastard!

27:51.560 --> 27:52.540
Oh, no, Kim.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.246
You didn't give Egg Boy money, did you?

27:55.800 --> 27:59.361
Hey! Egg Boy! Hey!
You're a little shitbird!

28:00.560 --> 28:02.244
I hope you get salmonella!

28:04.600 --> 28:06.140
I gave him, like, $100!

28:06.240 --> 28:07.685
- $100?
- What?

28:08.160 --> 28:10.686
I'd give you my eggs for $100.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.020
Where are we going?

28:13.120 --> 28:15.600
A whorehouse. You're going to love it.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.286
You see that?

28:21.160 --> 28:23.288
It's a brothel and a Chinese restaurant.

28:36.720 --> 28:37.767
Do you remember this video?

28:39.800 --> 28:41.325
Everybody was drawings.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.801
Me? Oh, no, thank you.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.820
Look, a month ago,
I was writing a story about corn syrup.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.700
Okay? I was not happy.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.180
I didn't think there was anything else
out there for me.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.620
Just death.

28:56.720 --> 28:57.820
Then this came along and...

28:57.920 --> 28:59.580
I don't care

28:59.680 --> 29:03.366
Wenge, do you guys have
regular access to healthcare?

29:14.440 --> 29:15.420
He called me a Fenian bastard.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.820
I fuckin' showed him what for,
kicked his teeth in, the cunt.

29:18.920 --> 29:22.163
Oi, Tanya? What's her story?

29:22.280 --> 29:26.580
She has a boyfriend.
And she's unconscious, okay?

29:26.680 --> 29:29.140
Not that either of those things
have ever stopped you before.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.100
That's not true. That's not true.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.565
Firstly, I'm afraid of boyfriends.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.368
Secondly, I'm a gentleman.

29:36.560 --> 29:40.580
What? According to no less
an authority than Grace Mugabe.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.180
I held a door open for her once.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.460
Let me just have a little peekaboo.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.860
Get out!

29:45.960 --> 29:47.769
Actually, not bad.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.966
- I think I missed one.
- Stop!

29:51.880 --> 29:54.260
Il y a du monde au balcon. Pas mal.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.540
Kim?

29:55.640 --> 29:57.020
You all right there, mate?

29:57.120 --> 29:58.620
Wouldn't you like to know?

29:58.720 --> 30:00.380
Hey. I'm just talking about her safety.

30:00.480 --> 30:04.041
Nic here does security for Kim, Iain.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.085
Right, well!

30:14.160 --> 30:16.288
I'm off. Excuse me.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.620
- Excused.
- Good night.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.722
- Bye, darling!
- Good night.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.488
The best, Nic!

30:36.000 --> 30:39.004
Oh, that's Oprah.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.260
Hello.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.840
It's Fahim. Are you ready to go?

30:55.680 --> 30:57.842
Go where, dude? It's Saturday.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.300
Friday is the only day off
in the Islamic week.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.811
We have interviews.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.660
No! That was not made clear. That's... No.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.780
That's bullshit, Fahim. No.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.611
Kim, today we are meeting
Ali Massoud Sadiq.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.451
I sent research.
He's likely to be Attorney General.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.860
- Please hold.
- Please come outside.

31:19.960 --> 31:23.140
This is against what I believe
as an American.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.242
I am sorry, but we have to go.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.100
My shoes. Shit.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.726
You wish to interview me, Mr. Ahmadzai?

31:30.240 --> 31:33.164
I do, Mr. Sadiq. Yes, on camera.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.300
Mr. Ahmadzai,

31:35.400 --> 31:39.700
I am a person of, of no consequence.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.580
Well, you soon might be the second
most powerful person in Afghanistan.

31:43.680 --> 31:48.220
Mr. Ahmadzai, I run a small department
inside the Interior Ministry.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.420
What possible interest
could I be to the Americans?

31:51.520 --> 31:55.047
Because your Ministry
for the Prevention of Vice

31:55.160 --> 31:56.980
and the Encouragement of Virtue

31:57.080 --> 32:01.210
sounds a lot like the Taliban's old
Ministry of Vice and Virtue.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.211
Don't you think?

32:14.080 --> 32:15.923
Kim Baker.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.220
When the Taliban was in power,

32:22.320 --> 32:24.940
they enforced their version of sharia.

32:25.040 --> 32:29.051
One of their edicts was a rule that
all men must shave the hair of their pubis.

32:29.160 --> 32:32.900
They would walk the streets
carrying a small wooden rod,

32:33.000 --> 32:34.660
a dowel,

32:34.760 --> 32:38.020
which they would roll along
the front of a man's trousers.

32:38.120 --> 32:42.364
If a man's pubic hair was long enough
to curl around the dowel,

32:43.880 --> 32:45.723
they would beat him.

32:46.880 --> 32:47.961
Now, I ask you,

32:48.960 --> 32:54.131
do I look like a man to walk the streets
carrying a hair-of-the-pubis dowel?

32:55.320 --> 32:56.890
No, sir, you do not.

32:58.240 --> 33:02.245
I returned to this country to save it.

33:02.360 --> 33:04.580
I am a friend of America.

33:04.680 --> 33:08.402
Which is why you should let me interview
you, so people can understand that.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.645
I like you, Kim.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.740
I like your mouthiness.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.524
That is a word, yes?

33:16.920 --> 33:19.526
It reminds me of my time living in London.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.371
You make me feel like a young man again.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.962
But I do not know you.

33:27.080 --> 33:31.210
How can we get to know each other, Kim?

33:38.760 --> 33:40.922
Yes, excellent, Kim!

33:43.280 --> 33:45.726
Put a turban on her,
she'd make a very handsome boy.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.083
How are you? You okay there?

34:26.120 --> 34:27.219
What the hell was that?

34:27.320 --> 34:29.420
It's probably just
a wedding somewhere nearby.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.380
They like to shoot off guns
at weddings here.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.050
You get it, you're from Florida.

34:33.159 --> 34:34.580
Funny.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.060
When was the last time I saw you?

34:36.159 --> 34:37.540
Since June?

34:37.639 --> 34:40.166
I'm sorry that I didn't
get back last month.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.179
I can be in New York by Thursday.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.260
I miss you and I want to see you. And I...

34:46.360 --> 34:47.739
I have...

34:47.840 --> 34:49.808
Not again.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.900
I hate this fucking airport.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.580
Can I bring you guys
anything from New York?

34:57.680 --> 35:00.001
Just bring us back a six pack?

35:00.720 --> 35:02.563
- This is Kim.
- Kim Baker?

35:02.840 --> 35:04.683
It is Sadiq.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.002
Mr. Sadiq, hi.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.460
How about an interview with Pacha Khan?

35:11.560 --> 35:13.300
Pacha Khan, the warlord?

35:13.400 --> 35:15.084
Pacha Khan is a businessman.

35:15.800 --> 35:16.980
Would you like that?

35:17.080 --> 35:20.460
Yeah. Yeah. But I'm on my way
to New York to see my boyfriend.

35:20.560 --> 35:25.202
You will be the first Western journalist
to interview him since the Soviet War.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.409
Shall we say tomorrow?

35:34.240 --> 35:37.164
Okay, yes, of course. Thank you.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.011
- What?
- Back in the car.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.081
Wait here.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.525
It's okay, come.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.090
She is a Muslim?

36:28.560 --> 36:29.721
Yes

36:31.680 --> 36:33.569
Have her pray for me.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.445
She is Turkish.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.851
You wouldn't understand her anyway.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.300
- Okay. Yes.
- Yeah?

36:58.400 --> 36:59.447
Okay.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.291
Pacha Khan, thank you
for your kind hospitality.

37:07.240 --> 37:10.642
Put a turban on her and she
would make a handsome boy!

37:23.000 --> 37:24.126
What?

37:25.680 --> 37:26.886
No.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.580
- Kim. Cheers.
- Hi.

37:31.680 --> 37:32.700
What a rush, yeah?

37:32.800 --> 37:36.740
Pacha Khan, yeah.
It's like, adrenaline. Everyone was...

37:36.840 --> 37:38.180
Good job.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.580
Yeah, it went well.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.763
But, you know, I was... I was in the...

37:43.040 --> 37:44.724
The New Zealand SAS back home.

37:44.880 --> 37:47.326
And today felt like
jumping out of an airplane.

37:47.720 --> 37:50.769
Or like, you know, like having sex.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.561
Kim!

37:58.080 --> 38:00.731
Tanya's got scotch.
It won't last long, so...

38:01.560 --> 38:04.769
Nic, you're welcome, too, you big cunt!

38:04.880 --> 38:08.123
That's a term of affection, by the way.

38:09.720 --> 38:13.884
You were supposed to be
in New York, sneaky girl.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.020
Yeah, Chris is not super pleased.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.487
Chris can suck a fat one.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.810
I'm trying to see if they put my story up,
but this Internet connection is the worst!

38:26.800 --> 38:29.246
- Goddamn it, Jaweed!
- Christ!

38:29.800 --> 38:31.140
Really?

38:31.240 --> 38:33.811
Although, donkeys aside,
he's a good fixer.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.448
No, thanks. Morning shows.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.040
You have something
they want for the mornings?

38:42.520 --> 38:45.410
Maybe. I don't know. Maybe.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.410
That's what I'm trying to see.

38:49.880 --> 38:52.980
You know, I heard
that he has contacts in the Tribals.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.890
Like real Taliban contacts.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.051
- Jaweed?
- Jaweed.

38:58.360 --> 39:00.886
- No fucking way.
- Apparently.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.924
Would you do that?
Would you go down there?

39:07.920 --> 39:10.287
Yeah, sure, if it was the right call.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.763
Yeah, but how do you know
if it's the right call?

39:16.240 --> 39:18.340
Fuck, man, I don't know.

39:18.440 --> 39:23.080
That is why we drink, do drugs and shag
strangers in restaurant bathrooms.

39:45.320 --> 39:46.460
Kim, are you okay? What's going on?

39:46.560 --> 39:48.580
Oh, shoot. Sorry, what time is it?

39:48.680 --> 39:50.260
I don't know. I'm in Seattle.

39:50.360 --> 39:52.380
God, I thought you got shot
at a wedding or something.

39:52.480 --> 39:53.527
- Jesus, Kim!
- No.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.540
Sorry. So, just real quick...

39:55.640 --> 39:58.211
- I want you to come visit me.
- In Afghanistan? Really?

39:58.320 --> 40:00.340
I mean, I've got tons of miles.
I could fly you first class.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.580
I have to look at a calendar.
I don't think I can do it this month.

40:02.680 --> 40:05.020
I'm here until, like, at least the 15th.
But when I get back maybe...

40:05.120 --> 40:07.122
- Who is in your bed, Chris?
- What?

40:08.160 --> 40:09.740
No, that's my bag.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.002
Look in the mirror, dipshit.

40:13.920 --> 40:16.740
My God. You motherfucker.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

40:16.840 --> 40:18.140
You calm the fuck down!

40:18.240 --> 40:19.980
Listen, you haven't been home in months.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.220
You forgot my fucking birthday!

40:21.320 --> 40:22.900
Right, it's my fault.
Great, Chris. You're a genius.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.180
And I kept your stupid
fucking plants alive,

40:25.280 --> 40:27.851
but you let this relationship
wither and die!

40:30.000 --> 40:31.900
Did you have that prepared?

40:32.000 --> 40:32.980
- What?
- Pussy!

40:33.080 --> 40:34.380
You know what? Have fun in Seattle.

40:34.480 --> 40:35.580
You should go to the Rock 'n' Roll Museum.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.011
It sucks. You'll fit right in.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.449
Are you shitting me?

41:07.120 --> 41:08.246
Fahim.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.323
Let's apply for another embed.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.540
Because I want to get out of Kabul.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.883
I just need to get out of Kabul.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.780
I need "me time", exactly. That's...

41:19.880 --> 41:24.250
See? I told you that O magazine would
increase your understanding of women.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.526
Hey, you guys are 3-5, right?

41:37.640 --> 41:39.483
Do you know a Corporal Coughlin?

41:39.600 --> 41:40.580
No, ma'am.

41:40.680 --> 41:43.126
Sorry, but I've only been here
for a couple months.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.980
Ma'am, if you set one foot
in front of the other,

41:47.080 --> 41:50.084
there's less chance you lose
both feet if we hit an IED.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.765
Vides, make ready.

42:02.200 --> 42:06.603
Man, we are definitely losing the war
when it comes to this particular well.

42:07.120 --> 42:10.220
I swear to God, they blow up another well,
I take another pair of boots off.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.448
It's like fucking musical chairs.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.060
Hey, do I have to buy a dress
for your wedding?

42:16.160 --> 42:19.403
No. Whatever you wear in Kabul is fine.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.242
- Yeah?
- Yes.

42:23.280 --> 42:26.966
The only thing I ask is that
you make sure my friend is there.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.962
Your friend is me.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.051
I get it.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.762
- Mount up!
- Jesus, Stern!

43:32.960 --> 43:35.780
General, excuse me. Hey.
General, do you have a minute?

43:35.880 --> 43:38.281
- Not now, Baker.
- It's just...

43:38.960 --> 43:41.566
The Taliban haven't been
destroying the well here.

43:41.680 --> 43:44.220
The women of the village
are destroying it.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.970
Or so they tell me.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.500
We dug that well several times
for the women

43:51.600 --> 43:53.284
so they don't have to walk to the river.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.100
But they want to walk to the river.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.740
It's their only chance to be social

43:57.840 --> 44:00.127
and gossip and, you know, hang out.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.900
I think that they have a bunch
of old Soviet landmines,

44:03.000 --> 44:06.163
and they just prop one up
and throw rocks at it.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.607
Kim, did you ever feel like
you're manning that tollgate

44:21.720 --> 44:24.564
and the engineer's yelling,
"I got pig iron, I got pig iron"?

44:25.480 --> 44:28.220
No. I don't know what that means.
But it's very folksy.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.500
Also, the women, obviously,
they don't want the men

44:30.600 --> 44:32.140
to know about this, so they are hoping

44:32.240 --> 44:34.820
that you would just refuse
to repair the well this time.

44:34.920 --> 44:35.921
Well, they're in luck.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.407
That's exactly what
I told the mullah, so...

44:41.080 --> 44:42.605
Well done, Baker.

44:43.560 --> 44:44.891
Hooyah, General.

44:46.200 --> 44:48.500
Marines say "Oorah".

44:48.600 --> 44:50.780
The Navy says "Hooyah".

44:50.880 --> 44:52.882
- Don't mix those two up.
- Got it.

44:53.960 --> 44:55.689
Have a good... Have a good ride.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.447
Kim.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.401
Kim.

45:28.800 --> 45:29.801
Sorry.

45:43.200 --> 45:45.260
- You look beautiful!
- You look beautiful!

45:45.360 --> 45:46.361
Oh, my God.

45:51.480 --> 45:53.403
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no!

45:53.520 --> 45:54.851
Kim!

45:56.680 --> 45:57.940
What the dick?

45:58.040 --> 46:00.060
Why did Fahim tell me
I could dress like this?

46:00.160 --> 46:02.660
Well, he didn't want you
to have to go buy something.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.540
Oh, my God. I only washed
the front of my hair.

46:04.640 --> 46:05.687
Here. You know what?

46:06.840 --> 46:09.525
- I'm going to let you have one of these.
- Thank you.

46:09.880 --> 46:12.460
- Now I look great.
- Now you're ready.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.767
- Now I'm ready to party.
- Oh, she likes it.

46:16.600 --> 46:17.681
- Sure.
- Oh, wow. Well...

46:36.560 --> 46:39.723
It was worse than a unibrow.
It went all the way into his hair.

46:40.800 --> 46:43.100
We all have some reason for being here.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.700
What's your reason?

46:44.800 --> 46:45.820
What is yours?

46:45.920 --> 46:47.220
I don't have a good one. I'm just here.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.140
Come on, she just told her unibrow story.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.580
I just... I don't have one.

46:50.680 --> 46:51.761
Come on.

46:54.080 --> 46:58.005
I was at the gym after work
one night. Stationary bike.

46:58.480 --> 47:01.300
Okay? The same bike every day.

47:01.400 --> 47:04.060
And I notice this

47:04.160 --> 47:06.810
indentation in the carpet,
it's, like, a foot in front of my bike.

47:07.640 --> 47:10.928
And I realize that it's from
where my bike used to be.

47:13.920 --> 47:17.527
I have done thousands of miles
on this bike

47:18.480 --> 47:20.580
and I have gone backwards.

47:20.680 --> 47:22.900
I have literally gone backwards.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.206
I just

47:24.800 --> 47:27.900
wanted to blow everything up.
I just wanted out of my job,

47:28.000 --> 47:31.780
writing news scripts for dumb
pretty people to read.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.245
I wanted...

47:34.200 --> 47:36.260
...out of having to decide whether

47:36.360 --> 47:39.603
I should just marry my mildly
depressive boyfriend.

47:39.720 --> 47:41.085
And that's it.

47:42.200 --> 47:46.444
I just... I couldn't look at that
fucking carpet anymore.

47:53.720 --> 47:56.940
Well, that is officially the most

47:57.040 --> 47:59.220
American white lady story I've ever heard.

47:59.320 --> 48:01.687
- Shut up.
- It is.

48:01.800 --> 48:07.620
You know what? Fuck that. You are
a battle-tested foreign correspondent.

48:07.720 --> 48:10.980
You're a solid Kabul 9.5.

48:11.080 --> 48:13.380
And you are fucking single, all right?

48:13.480 --> 48:16.404
So that lady back at the gym, she's dead.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.730
This is your life.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.660
Despite Taliban threats,
election observers

48:44.760 --> 48:47.900
are reporting high voter turnout,
especially in cities.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.860
A British fighter-bomber last week
reduced this compound to rubble.

48:51.960 --> 48:55.009
...not to cooperate.
Oh, God. Christ, there's a...

48:56.800 --> 48:59.260
Bahzo! There's a bahzo here!

48:59.360 --> 49:02.364
The surprise visit from
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

49:02.480 --> 49:05.220
Today, Kabul's
first licensed female driver,

49:05.320 --> 49:08.005
Gulbahar Yousofy, hits the road.

49:10.520 --> 49:13.126
That sucks. That sucks for women.

49:15.880 --> 49:17.041
Thank you.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.540
Congratulations on your promotion,

49:21.640 --> 49:23.220
- Mr. Attorney General.
- Thank you.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.860
As I said, we could have
done this over the phone.

49:24.960 --> 49:27.420
I'm just looking for a statement
on sharia in Kandahar.

49:27.520 --> 49:31.320
I understand that you are no longer
with your special friend Chris.

49:32.880 --> 49:33.900
Who told you that?

49:34.000 --> 49:38.820
Very little happens in Afghanistan that
Ali Massoud Sadiq does not know about.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.001
Very little.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.881
- May I show you something?
- Of course.

49:49.360 --> 49:50.820
You have a bed in your office.

49:50.920 --> 49:52.001
Yes.

49:52.840 --> 49:54.649
There is a bed here now.

49:57.480 --> 50:01.610
So, no comment on sharia in Kandahar or...

50:06.240 --> 50:07.660
No comment.

50:07.760 --> 50:10.206
- We are going to ISAF later, yes?
- I don't know.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.820
Pressers and "right of boom" crap.
Who cares?

50:12.920 --> 50:14.126
We need to enterprise something. Okay?

50:14.240 --> 50:16.288
We need to get out of the bubble.

50:16.840 --> 50:18.251
That hit the net.

50:18.680 --> 50:20.444
- The what?
- It hit the net.

50:20.760 --> 50:22.740
- The invisible net?
- Yes.

50:22.840 --> 50:24.500
- My point.
- Let's go. Bullshit.

50:24.600 --> 50:27.140
You know, Kim, the reason that
your village well story got traction is

50:27.240 --> 50:29.766
because it wasn't a bang-bang,
it was about women's rights.

50:29.920 --> 50:31.620
It was a brilliant piece, that.

50:31.720 --> 50:33.006
Oh, fucking hell.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.601
- We should go to Kandahar.
- No, too dangerous.

50:36.720 --> 50:40.100
No way. It's a wee bit fluid down there
these days, security-wise.

50:40.200 --> 50:41.940
Yeah, it might be a bit much for you, Nic?

50:42.040 --> 50:44.700
You're a bit late to the whole "Kandahar's
gone to shit" party. You know?

50:44.800 --> 50:46.740
What about the woman thing
where the sharia law is back?

50:46.840 --> 50:48.460
And there was a firebombing the other day.

50:48.560 --> 50:49.540
Yeah, I think it's worth the risk.

50:49.640 --> 50:51.380
That's easy for you to say, mate,

50:51.480 --> 50:54.260
sitting there in your cozzie
taking photos of the fucking garden.

50:54.360 --> 50:56.700
Look, Nicky, I know
you've been specially trained

50:56.800 --> 50:59.451
to protect New Zealand from,
what, fucking dolphins?

50:59.840 --> 51:01.860
But I'm not exactly
a war zone virgin, you know?

51:01.960 --> 51:04.580
I was kidnapped by the AIG
when they were still called that.

51:04.680 --> 51:06.170
Why dolphins?

51:07.000 --> 51:08.300
What do dolphins got to do
with New Zealand?

51:08.400 --> 51:09.380
Nothing to do with it. I'm just...

51:09.480 --> 51:11.700
White pointers and sharks,
but the dolphins never hurt anyone.

51:11.800 --> 51:14.220
I know they've not hurt anyone, mate.
I'm just making the point...

51:14.320 --> 51:17.380
I'm not gonna protect my country
from an animal that hasn't hurt anyone.

51:17.480 --> 51:18.641
Oh, Jesus Christ.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.660
Dolphins? What a joke.

51:21.760 --> 51:23.300
I'll come with you
in the car if there's room.

51:23.400 --> 51:25.129
Oh, great, we're all going to Kandahar!

51:27.560 --> 51:30.643
I can make some calls. We can take my car.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.727
Kim, if we are going to Kandahar,
you will need to buy some new clothes.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.521
I can't...

51:46.560 --> 51:49.689
It's so pretty, I don't even want to vote.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.940
I'm flipping you the bird
in here right now.

52:21.040 --> 52:22.300
- Is this your car, Fahim?
- Yes.

52:22.400 --> 52:23.780
This is a fucking piece of shit.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.609
I think it's very nice.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.260
No one is staring at me. It's weird.

52:32.360 --> 52:35.204
You are in the Blue Prison now.

53:08.960 --> 53:10.371
Fahim, what does the graffiti say?

53:10.880 --> 53:12.962
"No education for woman."

53:17.040 --> 53:18.769
Brian.

53:40.960 --> 53:42.325
Fahim, what's going on up there?

53:45.440 --> 53:46.646
The Taliban used to do this.

53:47.520 --> 53:50.000
Execute the radios and televisions.

53:54.200 --> 53:56.043
Oh, shit!

54:00.880 --> 54:01.881
Get out of the way!

54:02.000 --> 54:03.220
Move on! Move on!

54:03.320 --> 54:05.607
You guys can't go out there, but I can.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.922
- Kim, come back.
- Kim, wait! Come back.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.369
Kim, now. We must hurry. We must hurry.

55:13.920 --> 55:15.445
Get in the car!

55:18.240 --> 55:19.810
Get out of here!

55:22.480 --> 55:26.280
That was a men's park, Kim! Men only!

55:27.960 --> 55:29.121
Fuck!

55:31.440 --> 55:33.408
Bebakhshid, Fahim.

55:40.760 --> 55:43.765
...coalition capacity,
priorities and support.

55:44.080 --> 55:48.608
Let's look now at the 12 first-tier drivers
in the current COIN paradigm.

55:49.280 --> 55:50.220
Shit.

55:50.320 --> 55:52.163
Tactical and institutional...

55:52.280 --> 55:54.931
...is always in purple,
and noting as such...

55:55.760 --> 55:58.525
- Kim Baker.
- Sir, do you have a minute?

55:58.760 --> 56:02.260
If I'm understanding this briefing,
I have all the fucking time in the world.

56:02.360 --> 56:06.140
Okay. Well, I'm covering the girls' school
in Kandahar that was firebombed

56:06.240 --> 56:09.300
and I'm wondering if you could
give me something, on background,

56:09.400 --> 56:12.860
just about the security situation here

56:12.960 --> 56:14.780
and the state of the war in general.

56:14.880 --> 56:17.860
Yeah, I can give you something:
This war is like fucking a gorilla.

56:17.960 --> 56:20.122
You keep going till
the gorilla wants to stop.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.100
I think I can paraphrase that.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.565
Knock yourself out.

56:39.120 --> 56:44.340
You know, Afghanistan produces
90% of the world's narcotic opiates.

56:44.440 --> 56:45.885
So they say.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.860
When I worked in the hospital,

56:49.960 --> 56:52.940
these men, heroin addicts,

56:53.040 --> 56:55.780
would come in with a child.

56:55.880 --> 56:58.645
They'd say, "Oh, my son,
he broke his arm."

56:59.680 --> 57:04.527
And while we were tending to the child,
the men would steal our morphine.

57:05.160 --> 57:09.340
And we would wonder how
the arm got broken to begin with.

57:09.440 --> 57:11.602
What are we talking about, Fahim?

57:14.080 --> 57:18.244
The human body produces its own heroin.

57:18.360 --> 57:22.888
In fact, when the fight-or-flight instinct
is activated in the hypothalamus,

57:23.040 --> 57:28.046
your body releases endorphins,
dopamine and norepinephrine.

57:29.120 --> 57:33.780
That is heroin, cocaine
and amphetamine, all at once.

57:33.880 --> 57:37.340
Okay, great. Are we having
the Afghan version of this conversation,

57:37.440 --> 57:41.126
where in New York we would have
gotten to the point, like, five minutes ago?

57:44.480 --> 57:49.120
There is a reason to believe that a person
can get addicted to this type of high.

57:50.120 --> 57:52.620
Soldiers, athletes...

57:52.720 --> 57:54.643
War reporters. Got it.

57:55.480 --> 57:59.420
An addict always needs
a greater and greater dosage.

57:59.520 --> 58:03.380
And then people make mistakes,
people get hurt.

58:03.480 --> 58:06.380
I get it. You're a newlywed. I can

58:06.480 --> 58:09.086
probably get them to go up to $125 a day.

58:16.840 --> 58:18.490
Let us have the

58:19.480 --> 58:23.166
American version of this conversation.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.681
Okay.

58:26.440 --> 58:29.220
I do not want to work with you anymore.

58:29.320 --> 58:31.580
No, okay, wait. Fahim, I know I fucked up.

58:31.680 --> 58:34.160
I do not think you do.

58:34.280 --> 58:36.408
- Hear me out.
- Kim, no.

58:37.080 --> 58:41.820
I am now married. I want to have children.

58:41.920 --> 58:43.922
It will not happen again.
It's not gonna...

58:44.040 --> 58:49.046
"I ride after a deer and find
myself chased by a hog.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.444
"I plot to get what I want

58:52.480 --> 58:54.260
"and I end up in prison.

58:54.360 --> 58:57.887
"I dig pits to trap others and I fall in.

58:58.800 --> 59:01.371
"I should be suspicious of what I want."

59:02.920 --> 59:04.922
I don't know what that means.

59:09.200 --> 59:10.565
You do.

59:17.720 --> 59:18.721
Fahim?

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.610
I can't breathe in here.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.925
Time to take a walk.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.124
I have to go outside.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.763
I have to go home.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.091
Put on your headscarf

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.100
Shit.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.565
It's the wrong house.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.165
Oh, shit.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.443
Kim?

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.284
What the hell are you doing?

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.540
Here.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.645
Kim, sip that. Okay? You all right?

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.700
Keep sipping that.
You're all right. It's okay.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.165
It's okay. Hey.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.260
Hey, it's all right.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.420
Oi. Now, that there was a bit of fun.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.806
- Are you mental?
- Okay, mate...

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.420
I'm not your mate. I'm gonna
ask you again, are you fucking mental?

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.780
- Come on, Iain, it's not his fault.
- What's your job again?

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.380
Because if I hadn't come back
to see you lot

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.780
because I stole a bottle of sake
from a Japanese travel writer...

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.900
Wait, you have sake?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.420
...you could've killed her, "mate!"

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.124
Oh, fuck off.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.810
Jesus! What the fuck?

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.810
Dude, what the fuck?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.002
Did you fucking sucker punch me?

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.531
You broke my nose.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.202
- You fucking American?
- Are you a Yank?

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.209
I'm Canadian, you asshole.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.300
I almost fucked a Canadian?

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.300
I'd stay down if I were you, ya wee cunt.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.482
And that's not a term of affection.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.931
Fuck that.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.882
Oh, God!

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.460
- Wait.
- Oh, fuck.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.246
Iain, don't carry me around.
I'm not a fucking baby.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.180
Goddamn it.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.964
What the fuck are you doing?

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.162
- Take it off.
- I'm fucking trying to take it off!

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.460
Oh, God, I'm gonna put it
in you so fucking hard,

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.900
- you're gonna fucking get it.
- Don't talk.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.180
- I want everything in your mouth.
- Iain, just shut it.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.886
I'll take you lying down, come on.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.660
Do you have one of those
weird little penises?

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.940
No! This is how I want to go.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.042
No, I don't want to see myself.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.650
Roll off!

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.808
Okay, fuck it.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.460
Oh, God, I fucking...

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.620
What are you doing?

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.100
I'm just putting my fucking
finger in your mouth.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.180
No!

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.282
Come on, just put everything
in your mouth.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.485
- Do you want me to go?
- No.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.884
There's aught like a good shag.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.402
Okay, let's try to be adults here.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.085
I think we were.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.180
Obviously this was just
a Kabubble thing, right?

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.327
Just a

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.283
fun mistake where one of us had an orgasm.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.322
I mean, we're both in a really bad place.
And then you punched Nic.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.529
I don't know. It's endorphins, right?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.460
Nope, that's not what this is.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.220
No, you don't need to be gallant.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.084
I'm serious.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.289
I fancy you, Kim Baker.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.206
I do.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.340
Of all the dozens of women
in this country, I chose you.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.220
No, you didn't, because this is not me.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.420
I would never do this.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.060
Precisely. Because you're not you anymore.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.100
You're in the Kabubble.
You said so yourself.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.521
Don't fucking hide.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.340
Kim, you know the frog
in the pot of water?

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.569
You raise the temperature bit by bit,

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.284
the frog doesn't notice?

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.780
That's what this place and that's
what this job does to all of us.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.362
It changes your perception
of what's normal until...

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.964
...until here we are.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.820
You know the frog boils to death

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.500
- at the end of that, right?
- Nope.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.806
- Yeah.
- Nope.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.922
Is that my toothbrush?

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.060
What's going on
with my Kandahar piece, Ed?

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.620
Jerry killed it.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.721
Wait, who killed it?

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.300
Jerry Taub, head of the network, Kim.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.140
- What happened to Angela?
- She left.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.460
She's running a website
for women or something.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.300
Look, I can't sell Afghanistan
in Monday meetings.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:22.740
Your war's got chronic
same-shit-different-day-itis.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.140
Great. What am I even doing here, Ed?

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.500
I wouldn't ask that too loudly, Kim.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.161
Though I'd be thrilled to have
you back at your old desk.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.525
That's all I got.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.340
Hey, I heard that Nic quit
and you fucked Iain!

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.460
Whoa, hold on.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.820
Listen, the Iain thing
is not a thing, okay?

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.020
We have the same size hands. I can't.

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.740
It's just work has been
a little frustrating.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.860
Yeah. I get it.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.700
Because Afghanistan doesn't rate anymore.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.180
That is bullshit.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.200
You've got to find your own
luck here, babe, you know that.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.440
What?

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.100
What? What is that?

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.580
Hey! You're hooking up
Tanya in the Tribals?

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.060
What the fuck, Jaweed?

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.844
Her network will pay me triple.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.780
I taught you how to clear
your Internet history, okay?

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.460
What has Vanderpoel ever done for you?

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.900
Give me a break, man.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.140
Whatever. You owe me.
What else do you have?

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.300
You're Ghilzai, right?

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.220
Do you have any other connections
to members of the Ghilzai family?

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.980
- You mean Hekmatyar?
- Maybe.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.367
Are you fucking crazy, Kim? Please.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.580
Hey! Nabil! Hey.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.220
Are you still in touch with that ISI guy
who says he knows who killed Abdul Haq?

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.085
That guy? He's dead two years.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.726
Hey.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.180
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.611
Mrs. MacKelpie.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.242
- Twice?
- Two and a half, actually.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.420
I don't remember what happened last night.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.860
Kabul happened, my wee froggy in the pot.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.440
Did I not wear a headscarf?
Where's my phone?

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.620
I believe I threw your mobile
in my cupboard.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.780
Why?

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.121
Because mid-coitus you tried to call Tanya

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.288
about some bloody wild goose chase
in the Tribals.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.700
I told you about that?

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:35.566
It was hard to understand you once you asked
me to stuff your knickers in your mouth.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.809
I'm joking, Kim. That didn't happen.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.700
Fuck. I am...

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.643
I am fucking losing it.

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.700
I need a win.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.700
Christ, if you're that hard up,
I'll share my Badakhshan thing with you.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.140
What Badakhshan thing?

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.811
You know China won the contract
to mine for gold up there.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.380
They built roads, airport,
housing, all that.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.500
Well, guess whose responsibility it is
to protect the investment of Red China

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.489
in this restive nation?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.660
American troops, Chinese gold.
Oh, Iain, that's really good.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:05.900
People are gonna get mad.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.843
Just waiting for my guy
to give me the green light.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.420
You pay for the trip,
I'll share the story with you. Easy peasy.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.171
Really? Thank you. That's...

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.207
I owe you one.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.100
Well, how about a half of one?

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.500
And then we can make it an even three.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.728
Yeah. Or I could buy you breakfast.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.001
Or a half of one and we can
make it an even three.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:28.100
I think breakfast
is of equal monetary value.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.100
My middle name is Eoghan.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.260
Which is Erse... Shut up.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:33.930
It's Erse for Owen.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.420
"Oo-hee"?

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.420
- Iain "Oo-hee".
- Don't bother.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.779
Where is Bin Laden?

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.859
People think he's in Pakistan, right?

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.939
Yeah.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.779
You've got egg in your beard. Hang on.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.939
Thank you.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.700
Your national animal is the unicorn.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.779
I think it's romantic.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.020
That is the national animal of the kingdom
I ruled when I was eight.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.122
Who's your favorite Three Stooge?

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.723
Larry. Because he's put upon
in a way that I identify with.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.220
He's the Art Garfunkel, right?

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:01.660
Yeah.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.740
So, I thought I might like to
hang out with you for a bit.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.444
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:08.930
Do you really want to know
what I want to do?

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:09.962
Yeah. Okay.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.411
I'd like to kiss you.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.046
Who knew?

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:21.540
Here's my little man.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.779
No, Iain, don't. It's a scam.

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.100
Do you think so? Really?

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.819
I know it's a scam, Kim. So what?

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.921
He's still begging in the street.
Hey, Abrahaim.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.210
There's my boy.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.769
I knew I'd win you over.

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:52.486
Jesus!

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.564
What the fuck, Jaweed?
Are they coming or not?

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.287
Here they are.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.180
There they are.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.126
4-6800, line six north.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.331
Standing by approval.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.100
We are clear to engage target.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.282
Roger. Clear to engage target.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.730
It is him. That's my guy.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.260
If we go anywhere,
Jaweed, we take our vehicle.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.460
No carpooling.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.721
All right. Okay.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.883
Shit! Shit!

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.006
Stay calm.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.460
Splash.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.900
Cease laser. Safe laser.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.684
Laser off. Laser safe.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.967
I'm looking for someone. Excuse me.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.180
- Oh, my God. Tanya.
- Hi.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.691
- Jesus.
- Oy.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.169
Jaweed's dead.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:47.085
- Andy's in surgery.
- I know. Iain talked to Colin.

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:50.050
- Jesus!
- I know. It's fucked.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.403
You know, Colin was rolling.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.140
What, like, rolling-rolling?
You have tape?

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.380
He got the whole fucking thing.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.324
I'm going to go live with it
as soon as they let me out of here.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.161
Can you fucking believe it?

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.005
Hey.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.321
Hi.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:11.807
Aye.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.285
- How are you?
- You doing all right?

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.740
Holy shit!

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.922
And as we watch it again there, Susanna,

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.601
you can actually see the Hellfire missile
right before it detonates.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.660
What is going on with Badakhshan?

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.980
Snow's killing us.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.900
So unless your network wants
to stump up the money for the helicopter,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.380
we'll have to wait
till they clear the passes.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.050
Kim, we have a bit of a situation outside.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.740
What?

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.569
I just need you to see something.

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:45.100
Sorry to interrupt.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.601
- Did he say what he wanted?
- I don't know.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.371
Fuck.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.020
Qadar. Qadar, it's okay. You can go in.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.485
He just wants to talk to me.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.284
- Okay. Okay.
- It's okay.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.860
Please, do not cover
your hair on my account.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.300
It's such beautiful hair.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.580
It's like the hide of a fine horse.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.126
Sadiq, what are you doing here?

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.860
I was just going home
from closing a woman brothel

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.060
when I told my driver,

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:23.500
"Mahboobullah, this is where
my best friend Kimberly lives!"

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.002
But she has been a bad friend lately.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.844
She does not call.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.245
She does not invite me to her party.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.780
I'm sorry,

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:39.363
but I didn't think the Attorney General
of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.700
went to parties at guesthouses.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.500
And why not?

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.660
I am still a man, no?

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.660
I love music.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:49.161
I love to dance!

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.601
But

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.770
even though you have been a bad friend,
I want you to be happy.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.569
Do you have a special friend?

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.045
Because

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.725
I would love to be your special friend.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.805
Would you like that, Kim?

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.165
You're a bad friend.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.100
You are a bad friend.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.100
In America, I would get
a book deal out of this shit!

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.300
You can't just do this, okay?

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.540
I haven't been on the air in months!

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.406
My best friend here almost died,
and I am jealous of her!

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.325
And I am just...

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.731
Fuck this! All of it!

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.445
That was a bomb.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.500
Hello! So, wait!

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.020
Who is fronting the show?

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.940
Tucker? No, I don't know who that is.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:22.340
Okay, well, I could go live
for the overnights, but this is...

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.683
"Satellite time?"
No, I have a dedicated feed.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.451
Since when?

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.601
This is Tucker Wang.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.860
This is Kim Baker.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.440
Why am I being told that
I don't have a sat hookup?

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.443
Because you're on the hourly plan now.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.130
And either way, the show is full tonight.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.420
No. Who is your boss?

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.921
I want to talk to this
Jerry whatever, Taub.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.620
Okay, look, Jerry has mentioned
Afghanistan to me once,

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:45.540
and mentioned it to know why
the only good story to come

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.300
out of there in a year
was on another network.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.700
What, Tanya's thing?
No, I've got shit like that.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.500
I'm waiting for the snow to melt!

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.020
I want to talk to Jerry.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.380
If I could just get you to get me a story
that somebody would care about,

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.020
it would be fine. But meanwhile...

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:01.220
Okay, what if I come to New York and I
burst into Jerry's office? How about that?

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.049
Well, that might look
like I hadn't done my job.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.003
Perfect. See you Wednesday.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.121
Cunt.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.969
Kim.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.003
Kim, look at these dogs.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.860
How does this end?

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.962
A bucket of cold water, I suppose.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.681
No.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.685
How does this

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.160
end?

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.683
I don't really know, Kim.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.260
We grow old together?
Get a cottage in the country?

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.010
Raise chickens?

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.724
Eat scrambled eggs off each other?

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.820
Look, we're good, aren't we?
We'll always have Kabul.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.886
No, we won't. We won't "always have" it
because I have to go home.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.580
No, this is home.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:57.180
I have to go to New York City
and justify my life

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:01.727
to somebody named Jerry before
he takes it all away, and I

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:07.809
cannot go back to sitting
at a goddamn desk. I can't.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.940
Aye. Listen...

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.260
No one can take it away from you.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.600
Not all of it.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.688
Whatever happens, you'll have me.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.409
That's a very nice thing to say, but...

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.721
But what?

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:36.380
Following a fatal traffic accident
involving a coalition truck,

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.720
long simmering frustration

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.380
today boiled over
into violence and despair.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.900
They kill us!

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.980
They kill us and they break our hearts!

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.660
And I also give this message
to President Hamid Karzai:

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.161
What the hell is happening here?

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.060
Okay, I don't care who the hell's in there.
I'm Kim Baker.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.660
Go on in, Kim. Jerry's expecting you.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.180
Well, that's fucking unsatisfying.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.011
- Can I take your bag?
- Yes. Please.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.282
- Would you care for some water?
- Yes.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.500
I should've Googled you.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.683
I've been... I've been using
all the wrong swear words.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.700
Well, I hope
I didn't ruin your big moment.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.540
Look, Geri, I don't know what
Tucker has been telling you.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.041
He said that you're upset
about the air time you're getting.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.420
That's just wrong,
because this is not about me.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.650
My frustration is with our priorities
and what's best for the network.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:00.006
Isn't deciding what's best
for the network my job?

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.180
I'm just saying, as journalists,
we have an obligation to this story.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.820
And Afghanistan should be
on our air more, period.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:11.580
With the resources we have over there,

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.140
Afghanistan should definitely
be on our air more.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:18.370
But the problem is, as much as
everyone loves the troops,

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.860
they don't actually want to watch them
on the news anymore.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.121
They just don't.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.220
So I can't give Afghanistan more air.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.260
Which means I need to give
Afghanistan fewer resources.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.840
That's what's best for the network.

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.842
- Geri...
- You have that call now.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.420
I'm not trying to be a bitch.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.681
Okay, let me pitch you something.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.020
All right, the Chinese
mining concession...

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.100
Jesus!

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.100
Look, the last person who got any
kind of bounce out of Afghanistan

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.940
was your friend Tanya Vanderpoel.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:52.362
She's actually got me over a barrel
thanks to that drone story.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.180
What do you mean, "over a barrel"?

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.645
She's London, Kim.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.328
- You're hiring Tanya.
- Yes.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.609
I assumed you two flew here together.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.891
She's here.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:13.180
I'm sorry, you started talking
to her before the UAV strike?

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.805
Is UAV a drone?

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.086
Hello! Where are you going?

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.801
No, I'm only here for a few days.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.810
Oh, I know.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.046
Fuck.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.284
I don't know what to say.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.420
Ducky, I'm sorry. I fucked up.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.820
Did you go to the Tribals because
you were in a contract negotiation?

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.100
Dude, I'm not stealing your job, okay?

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.044
Tanya, this is not about my fucking job.

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.820
We have to make good calls, right?

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.740
And now Andy lost an eye
and Jaweed is dead.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.460
Christ, man, we've both
fucking made mistakes!

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.609
No. Tell me you didn't go to the Tribals
because of a contract.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:54.820
You would have done exactly what I did
if Jaweed had gone to you.

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.570
No. I'm not you.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.122
Do you remember your first embed?

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.442
You interviewed a young Marine?

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:09.540
Coughlin? Yes. What?

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.140
Yeah, well, after they aired your story,

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:17.340
where you used his soundbite
about not loading his rifle,

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.408
they sent him to Helmand.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.122
And he got his legs blown off.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.445
So I hear.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.565
See you in Kabul.

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:04.684
I'm not really surprised
she chased the story.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.540
That's what we do. That's what you do.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:07.687
I would do it.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.170
Sorry.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.980
Goddamn it, I'm tired.

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.380
You booked your return yet?

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.260
'Cause you could come through
Glasgow if you wanted.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.300
- I'll meet you.
- What?

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.100
No. What about Badakhshan?

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:25.260
Badakhshan, that will keep because
the fucking pass is still snowed in.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:28.100
I need that story.
I need a hit, all right?

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.300
I need something
so that Geri doesn't decide

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.687
I'm more useful as an ottoman
in her fucking office.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.700
What you need, Kim,
is some time out of the bubble.

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:38.180
You'd better get ready.
I'm fucking making love to you

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.204
to bagpipe versions of Sade songs.

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.620
Yeah, okay.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.529
Really? You'll meet me in Glasgow?

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.780
Yeah, I'll meet you in Glasgow.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:51.530
- I'll get the next flight.
- Okay.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.882
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:04.700
Hey, Antoine.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.690
Where have you come from?
I thought you were in Badakhshan.

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.900
I was. Drove back overnight.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.846
- Wait, what? The pass is open?
- Oui. For now.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.081
Cheers.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.771
Oh, Christ.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.847
Excuse me.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:23:59.721
Kunduz near?

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.127
Far?

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.846
I'd like to rent a car.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.405
Aye, thank you.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.966
Yeah, I get it. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.924
Oh, Jesus.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.164
Oh, shit.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.527
Welcome to Glasgow International Airport.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:02.420
Outside temperature's 18 degrees Celsius.

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:04.580
Local time is 15 hours.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.500
There will be an airline representative
to assist you to your luggage.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.728
Once again, thank you
for flying with us...

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.605
Oh, my God.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.380
Leaving a message for Susan.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.620
Woodward, I'm back in Kabul again.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.260
I'm trying to get information about
the disappearance of Iain MacKelpie,

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.500
so if someone at Reuters
can please call me back.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.380
Call to let me know
that you've received this message.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.686
Thank you.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.940
Who kidnaps a Scottish
freelance photographer?

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.180
The whole point of kidnapping
is to get money, right?

01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:01.460
As far as I understand, Iain was just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.340
Can this half-assed country
not even do kidnapping right?

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:07.420
ISAF does not think this was
an upper-tier organization.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.300
So these men will probably try
to sell him to someone else.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.540
And then there will be some talking,
you know.

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.961
Oh, my God, Fahim. They're gonna kill him.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.851
No, they will not, Kim, inshallah.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:25.408
Now is when you're supposed
to say "I told you so".

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.446
Fuck!

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.962
Ramadan has ended.
They are slaughtering lambs.

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:10.167
- May I speak with him?
- The general's busy.

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.122
Really, General? The elliptical?

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.449
I have bad knees.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.860
I'm guessing you didn't come
here for the smell of balls.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.928
Everybody get the fuck out!

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.300
They believe that he may have been sold

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.883
to another organization
somewhere in that same region.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.207
That's a pretty big ask, Baker.

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.002
There's a real-time clock on this.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.523
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.340
You know, it's just a shame that

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:05.100
y'all don't get credit for all these
high-profile things that you do.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.680
You know, especially with
SEALs and Delta out there.

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.441
I mean, what week goes by they don't
see those assholes on TV, am I right?

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.300
And then next time Congress votes
on a Pentagon budget

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:20.060
and there's this pesky little
10% line item for the Marines,

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.180
next thing you know,
you guys are just part of the Navy.

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:26.923
Although, sir, you would look spectacular
in one of those pretty white uniforms.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.125
God, you know what?

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.620
It's just occurring to me
that, unlike JSOC,

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.927
you guys allow reporter embeds.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:42.926
Which means that a cameraman
could go on a FORECON mission.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.609
Don't you think that would be
great for the Corps, sir?

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.923
That kind of exposure?

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:51.965
Pretty good for you, too.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.180
Look, we don't go in blind.

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.700
We have to know what we're
doing and where we're going.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.180
It's the way we work.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.940
We're not likely to get an address, but...

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.964
When you have something concrete,
come back and we'll get kinetic.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:19.500
Please tell Mr. Sadiq
that his "special friend" is here.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.980
What can I get for you?
Some tea? The new PlayStation?

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.970
No, thank you.
I just need a moment of your time.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.100
We still friends, Sadiq?

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.260
Well, that is up to you, Kim.

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:37.020
Because you once told me that nothing
happens here that you don't know about.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:41.300
So you must know about my friend
Iain MacKelpie getting kidnapped.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.460
I did hear about this, yes.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.740
Yeah, well, everybody heard about it,

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:48.300
but a powerful man such as yourself
must actually know something.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.500
Or your friend Pacha Khan knows something.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.126
- Or his friend does.
- Of course.

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:58.482
I could make some inquiries, but I can
only do this for a very special friend.

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.980
I have a video that I think
you should watch, Sadiq.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:22.606
You push the little triangle.

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.081
You can watch video on the phone?

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.001
What is this?

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:36.500
It looks like the Attorney General
of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.886
dancing in the street

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.363
with a Western enemy of Islam
at a party where alcohol was served.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.940
I've never touched alcohol in my life!

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.963
Well, I'm just saying how it looks.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.883
It's a good idea, right?

01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.723
It's a great idea!

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.681
It's fucking ace!

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:05.885
Good on ya, Kim!

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:11.003
Let's go, load up!
Let's go, move, move, move!

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.811
You drink Tennessee whiskey, Miss Baker?

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.001
Yeah.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.125
Outstanding.

01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.884
Tall Brian? What the fuck?

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.180
Hang tight, sir.
I'm gonna get you that ride.

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.725
Thank you.

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.646
What happened to the army, Dr. Brydon?

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.050
I am the army.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.860
Thank you, Kim.

01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:58.200
How are you?

01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.841
I've had worse kidnappings.

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:04.801
MacKelpie is being
treated for minor injuries.

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.929
Again, this incredible footage was
produced by our very own Kim Baker.

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.327
Just incredible. Way to go, Kim!

01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:18.100
If you want to kidnap someone
fucking twice, you do a Toyota.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:21.860
Fucking not as interesting as it got
when they fucking pulled out a burqa.

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.500
It's too fucking long for me!

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.180
I don't know who
the woman was it belonged to.

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:26.860
I'm not fucking 6'2", right?

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:29.900
I'm dragging this fucking thing along,
thinking the only consolation is,

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.100
at least if I'm a fucking woman,

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:34.931
I'm not gonna get buggered,
you know what I'm saying?

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.740
So anyway, I took
a little something, actually.

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.340
I went to the gift shop at Taliban.

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:48.365
I'm afraid all I could get was that.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.090
It's a shame you're going.

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.220
Well, I hope at least they're
flying you first class.

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.020
Geri doesn't like me that much.
But she does like me now,

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:26.164
so while I have this juice, I've got
to leverage it into something better.

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:27.500
Yes!

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.860
Yes, wait, Iraq.

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.580
I'll come with you.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:33.460
No, actually, Pakistan.
That's where the real shooting shit is.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.780
It's like the Wild West out there.

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.804
Actually, I told Geri
that I want New York or D.C.

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.280
No, I did.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.940
No, really, where are you going?

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.451
New York or D.C.

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:51.681
Why?

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:55.009
You can still come with me.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.460
Because I think
there's plenty of good work

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:07.128
to be done in the real world,
and the Kabubble is well-established.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.820
Is this about me going
to Badakhshan without you?

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:12.460
'Cause you would have done
exactly the same thing.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.449
And, hey, what, I forgive you!

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.204
This is not about you.

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:23.963
It's not about Badakhshan, or Glasgow,
or the cottage with the chickens.

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:26.206
What chickens?

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.129
It's okay. I know you're not gonna come.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.363
I just have to get out of here
before it's too late.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.365
What do you mean?

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.602
I started to feel like this was normal.

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.523
You know it's not, right?

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.490
Come to New York and get it.

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:16.604
Remember, you're like a six in Manhattan.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.205
How's your baby?

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.200
Which one?

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:55.723
- You have two?
- Yes.

01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:59.723
Irish twins.

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.260
No, they are very good.

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:07.125
The younger one, the boy,
he's very strong.

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.860
I bet the girl is strong, too.

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.325
She's stronger.

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.330
So,

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:47.321
those men in the hospital, the addicts...

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.060
Any of them ever get better?

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.845
Have a happy ending?

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.444
In my culture, we would hug.

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.361
Hey.

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.443
You know, I miss it. The Stan.

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.420
Yeah, I miss it, too.

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.602
Actually, I tried to go back

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.290
but even the Army wouldn't take me.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.009
I mean, the Army!
I mean, that's just hurtful.

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:54.020
Well, I'm very sorry
for what happened to you.

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:58.041
So if there's anything that you want
to say to me, that's why I'm here.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.050
That's why I came here.

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.487
Ma'am,

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.807
I lost my legs because of an IED,
not because of you.

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.220
I appreciate that,
but if I hadn't quoted you,

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.641
you wouldn't have been transferred.

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.500
No, really, you can say
whatever you want to me.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.620
That's why I'm here.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.020
Okay, well, then let's say you're right.

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.201
It's still not 'cause of you, ma'am.

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:23.820
Some 12-year-old haji
had to plant that bomb.

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:28.060
And, hell, you know, if Bin Laden's
parents hadn't have gotten divorced,

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.084
maybe none of us would've been
in the Stan to begin with.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.540
And the Taliban, they wouldn't
have even been there for UBL

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.850
if Brezhnev hadn't have gone and fouled up
Afghanistan in the first place.

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:45.340
And the British Empire. Yeah.

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.580
And Kim Baker.

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:48.170
Okay, I deserve that.

01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:53.644
Goddamn! Once you got no legs,
everyone takes everything so serious.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.800
I mean, there's only so much
any of us have any control of,

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:02.100
good or bad.

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:05.340
If you didn't learn that in Afghanistan,
you were not paying attention.

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.660
So, you're not gonna yell at me?

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:10.081
I mean, ma'am...

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.644
Kim, you've got to move on.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.202
You're giving yourself
way too much credit.

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:23.042
You embrace the suck,
you move the fuck forward.

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.401
What other fucking choice do we have?

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.571
Do I hear swearing over there?

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:39.980
How are you standing there
the one time I curse?

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.100
- "One time".
- I mean...

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.140
It's true. He had a good
long run in the military.

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.129
Don't cover up for him.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:46.980
So, Kim, are you gonna stay for dinner?

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.844
Of course she will.

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.921
Bye!

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.049
Say bye to Kim. Say bye. Bye, Kim!

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:39.180
Colonel, the Afghan National Army missed
yet another benchmark for preparedness.

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:42.300
How do you think that will affect
our draw down in the region?

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.700
There needs to be a revision
to the previously announced draw down

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.820
or our future exit strategy.

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.048
- Thank you, Colonel Roberts.
- Thank you. My pleasure.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.580
Coming up, a look at the war on terror

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:54.300
that's close to home
for those of us who cover it.

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:58.340
From London, I'll be joined by award-winning
combat photographer, Iain MacKelpie.

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.220
His new book, Conflict Zone,

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:04.220
chronicles a decade spent working
in the Middle East and Afghanistan.

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.060
That's when we return.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.740
And we're clear. Back in 40.

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:09.820
Hi, Iain.

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:11.900
Hi. Was I supposed to say something then

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.220
- when you introduced me?
- Nope.

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:16.529
Nope. Just sit up, smile.

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.724
I can't smile. My face feels weird.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.900
No, you're fine. You look good.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.820
- Thank you for coming on the show.
- No, please. Thanks for having me.

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.922
I got it. Okay, yeah. Got it.

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.820
You know, they got me
on this book tour at the moment.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:33.004
I'm gonna be in New York at the end
of the month, if you'd fancy a coffee.

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:37.845
We're back in five, four, three...
