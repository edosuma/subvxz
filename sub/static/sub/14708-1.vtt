running over the catcher.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.814
If anybody does any
of these things...

10:13.914 --> 10:16.784
it will result in an immediate
ejection, am I clear?

10:16.884 --> 10:18.952
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.955
Wonderful, now these are seven
inning games, not nine.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.257
The winner of this game
and the other semifinal...

10:24.357 --> 10:27.094
will advance to the regionals
in Ocean City, Maryland.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.228
Any questions?

10:28.328 --> 10:30.463
Yeah, who the fuck are you?

10:30.664 --> 10:31.531
I'm Alex Ca --

10:31.732 --> 10:33.266
Ah! I know who you are.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.035
You're that hot shot center
fielder out of Florida State.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.303
What the fuck are you
doing here?

10:36.403 --> 10:38.005
Just relax, dude.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.807
There's nobody here who
isn't supposed to be here.

10:39.907 --> 10:43.010
Bullshit! None of these guys
were here a week ago.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.545
Everybody here was listed
on our original roster.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.880
There you go, Ump.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.615
Their dues were paid by either
themselves...

10:48.716 --> 10:51.284
or by somebody on their behalf.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.990
All the documents are here,
Happy.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.866
There's like 50 fucking names
on this roster!

11:05.966 --> 11:09.569
There's nothing in the rule book
about a maximum roster size.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.773
This is a bunch of horse shit!
You're gonna let this happen?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.141
You want to get a lawyer?

11:14.241 --> 11:18.111
Oh, this is a bunch
of horse shit!

11:18.211 --> 11:21.181
That's-- just gonna--
sorry.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.783
I told you we shouldn't
call 'em D-Backs.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.117
Shut up, Garvey!

11:24.217 --> 11:25.618
He's very passionate.

11:25.753 --> 11:28.822
Don't be afraid to ask for help.
There's no shame in that.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.758
That's real strength.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.983
You know, you don't have to do
this if you don't want to.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.186
It's been a rough couple days.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.790
I'm sure they'll understand.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.260
I mean, I don't even think
they care about this game.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.070
You know, it could be a good
idea just to...

12:17.170 --> 12:20.808
take a little break from
baseball for a while, you know?

12:22.109 --> 12:24.244
I mean, God knows
you've earned it.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.081
Right?

12:32.252 --> 12:37.024
I mean... right?

12:42.996 --> 12:44.898
Let's play ball.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.840
It's audacious is what it is.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.843
You know? It's audacious!

12:55.909 --> 12:57.878
You just learn that word, Ty?

12:57.978 --> 12:59.546
Oh so this doesn't bother you?

12:59.646 --> 13:04.184
Of course, it does, man.
It's-- it's Bush League.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.285
Yes!

13:05.385 --> 13:06.854
Yeah.

13:06.887 --> 13:11.158
Exactly! It's Bush League!
It's--

13:11.258 --> 13:12.960
What's up, guys?

13:13.060 --> 13:16.196
Hey, what's up, Maz?

13:18.531 --> 13:19.732
Sorry, I'm late.

13:19.867 --> 13:23.136
No, it's fine. It's fine.

13:25.072 --> 13:29.109
I wasn't sure if--
I'm glad you're here.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.411
I wanted to go over
the line up with you.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.146
Okay.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.883
Come on.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.053
They brought in a bunch
of stud horses today.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.554
It's gonna be hard
to beat them.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.723
It's gonna be like
the '27 Yankees...

13:43.891 --> 13:45.492
versus the fucking
Lollipop Guild.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.227
Ouch!
Okay, Ty! We get it!

13:47.327 --> 13:49.162
It's because we're short,
we get it!

13:49.262 --> 13:50.797
So what I was thinking is,
even though we usually bat...

13:50.898 --> 13:52.332
you third, we're gonna
put you first...

13:52.432 --> 13:54.902
so you can get up as many times
as possible, but only if...

13:54.968 --> 13:56.736
you're all right with that,
if you think it's smart.
Ty.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.139
I know you like to get in third
and drive in a bunch of runs.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.008
but I'm thinkin' if that
we put speed in at the bottom--

14:01.108 --> 14:02.542
Ty!
Yeah?

14:02.642 --> 14:04.978
You can bat me first, you can
bat me ninth for all I care.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.915
You can make me bat boy,
it doesn't matter.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.150
You don't have to come to me.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.086
I just, thinking with the
whole draft thing...

14:13.186 --> 14:16.323
I thought it might...
take your mind off of it.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.558
You thought you'd get my mind
off baseball by talking to me...

14:18.658 --> 14:20.961
about baseball at a baseball
game?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.362
It isn't working?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.033
Look who's coming.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.235
Schwartz. Hold on, hold on.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.773
That is the biggest Bush league
move I've ever seen, man!

14:33.941 --> 14:35.608
You can't just pull a bunch
of guys off the street...

14:35.708 --> 14:37.677
and start a new team just
because it's the playoffs!

14:37.945 --> 14:39.079
Ty-- Jesus--

14:39.179 --> 14:40.580
We were teammates for three
years at STAC!

14:40.680 --> 14:42.950
I know, Ty! I get it.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.318
I came over to say I understand
why you're upset.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.055
It's not my team. All right,
it's not my roster.

14:48.155 --> 14:51.158
I don't make the rules... Jesus.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.296
Maz, I also came over to say
I'm sorry about the draft.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.099
You deserved it.

15:12.145 --> 15:16.283
I'm sorry, too.
It really sucked.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.988
Ice cream! Get your
ice cream here, boys!

15:21.088 --> 15:22.789
Ice cold ice cream,
get it while it's hot!

15:22.990 --> 15:24.124
We get ice cream?

15:24.224 --> 15:27.027
Duh, bro, Maz eats ice cream
before every game.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.695
We realize it's the secret
to his success.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.630
So we're gonna do that now, huh?
Of course, it's playoffs.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.065
We need the competitive
advantage!

15:32.165 --> 15:34.267
Well, back off, back off, hey,
stop crowding!

15:34.367 --> 15:36.469
Stop crowding, all right?
Maz gets to pick first.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.838
Maz which one do you want?

15:39.006 --> 15:40.507
I think I'll skip today.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.843
What? Maz, you gotta have your
rainbow sprinkles, bro!

15:44.011 --> 15:46.046
I just don't want it.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.281
He doesn't fucking want it,
then leave him alone,
he doesn't have to have it.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.849
Okay, but what if it creates
a fissure...

15:50.017 --> 15:51.218
in the space time continuum?

15:51.318 --> 15:54.054
Serious, Maz,
I got like three extra.

15:56.189 --> 15:59.126
Well, thank God I'm here.
I mean really, the things I do,
excuse me.

15:59.226 --> 16:04.464
There we go, that is it.
There we go.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.134
Oh... that's it.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.502
My bad, thanks, David.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.139
All right, guys, listen up!

16:12.239 --> 16:16.043
I gotta figure out the line up.
Who doesn't want to play today?

16:16.776 --> 16:20.913
Oh, ha-ha, yeah. Very funny.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.883
Seriously, I gotta sit
someone out. Who's it gonna be?

16:24.051 --> 16:25.652
I'm nursing a pretty aggressive
hangover...

16:25.752 --> 16:28.055
so I'll nominate myself.

16:28.155 --> 16:31.624
All right, good, and
Jonathan's pitching...

16:31.724 --> 16:33.060
so he's not in the lineup.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.062
Whoa, whoa, Dells is pitching?

16:35.095 --> 16:37.230
Yeah, Zapata, he's a pitcher.
That's what they do.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.132
He's gonna crush this team,
right, Jonathan?

16:39.232 --> 16:40.333
But he's our closer.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.901
He's not closer, he's a starter.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.370
He closed for us at STAC.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.538
Hey, Jonathan, are you
a starter or a closer?

16:45.638 --> 16:47.207
Starter? Yeah, thank you.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.076
I'm just saying, that's a pretty
big workload for somebody...

16:49.176 --> 16:50.543
who's been closing all year.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.279
Well, if he gets tired,
I will bring in a closer.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.913
But he's our closer.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.682
Hey, everybody, enough! All
right, I'm the coach!

16:55.782 --> 16:58.718
And I say my brother is
starting, so he's starting.

16:58.818 --> 16:59.852
You're the coach?

17:00.087 --> 17:01.654
Yeah, Polacco!

17:01.754 --> 17:03.423
Where have you been, huh?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.657
I'm holding the clipboard.
Are you holding the clipboard?

17:05.758 --> 17:09.096
Oh, I didn't think so! All
right, anybody else holding a
clipboard...

17:09.195 --> 17:12.098
please raise your clipboard!

17:13.833 --> 17:15.202
You bring that from home?

17:15.301 --> 17:16.203
Yeah.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.471
Borrowed it from my dad.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.509
Now I'm the only one holding
a clipboard.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.444
All right, so is there any
more insubordination...

17:24.544 --> 17:27.146
before I finish figuring
out this line-up?

17:27.247 --> 17:30.450
You have no idea how badly
I want to think of something
else to say.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.320
Well, time's up!

17:35.322 --> 17:37.124
All right, here's our line-up.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.194
First, John Mazzello, shortstop.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.297
Second, Arthur Barone, DH.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.266
Third, Ty Dellamonica, 3rd base.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.868
Fourth, Mike Triana, left field.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.404
Fifth, Chris Zapata, 2nd.

17:51.504 --> 17:55.007
Sixth, Brian "Botch" Rocco,
1st.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.444
Seventh, Pat Murray, center
field.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.147
Eighth, Vinnie Malzahn, in
right.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.849
And ninth, Jon Garvey, catcher.

18:02.949 --> 18:06.186
Pitching is Jonathan
Dellamonica.

18:06.286 --> 18:10.157
And on the bench are Ryan
Polacco and David Stein.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.527
Everybody got that?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.263

after some ice cream.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.459
You know what I mean?

19:59.332 --> 20:01.434
Hey, Brian, how you doing?
Hi, Joey.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.437
How's Johnny Boy doing?

20:04.537 --> 20:07.274
He'll bounce back.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.905
He's taking it harder than
Johnny. Your boy earned it.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.709
Is he going to try again
next year?

20:42.809 --> 20:45.912
He got an offer to play in an
independent in Arizona

20:46.012 --> 20:49.181
and to play in Italy,
but it's up to him.

20:49.282 --> 20:53.853
Ah, it's a shame, you know,
it's like winning the lottery.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.756
It's such a long shot.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.529
It's just a shame,
the window is so short.

Oh, by the way, I was watching
you take those ground balls
out there.

on those.

hand of yours, right?

Which would be your... right.
I'm a righty, yeah, right.

you just pop it on top of that
glove, pop, pop, pop.

Pop, pop, pop.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.401

on the field next.

I will, thank you so much.

a little chatter *

he hits one out of here
first at bat?

I'm not gonna bet against Maz,
bro.

to do, you have to do!

24:00.206 --> 24:02.341

24:21.060 --> 24:22.128
Shut up, Garvey.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.596
Okay.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.999
What's up, bro?

24:32.204 --> 24:36.108
Dude... you know, if your last
name was Martinez...

24:36.208 --> 24:37.810
you would have been drafted.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.247
You really believe that?

24:41.347 --> 24:42.882
Hell, yeah, I believe that.
Really?

24:42.982 --> 24:48.154
Hell yeah, bro, look, we're the
hot new ethnicity right now.

24:48.254 --> 24:51.390
You know? Scouts can't see
past that shit.

24:51.558 --> 24:54.561
If a scout sees a Latino dude
who can't hit...

24:54.627 --> 24:56.162
can't field for shit,
but he's fast

24:56.262 --> 24:58.865
you know what they call it?
'Raw talent'.

24:58.965 --> 25:02.001
I swear, man, it's like their
new way of calling us spics
or some shit.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.403
Bro, they can call me Speedy
Fucking Gonzales...

25:04.571 --> 25:07.106
as long as they draft me, shit.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.642
Seriously, I'll step in the
batters box wearing a poncho.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.611
You know what I mean?

25:11.711 --> 25:14.581
I'm not saying there aren't
plenty of our guys who deserve
it

25:14.614 --> 25:18.918
but shit, my boy Maz
deserves it, too.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.721
It's your size too, John.
They overlook guys like you.

25:21.821 --> 25:26.158
But if a 6' 5" goon steps up,
who couldn't hit water if he
fell out of a boat

25:26.258 --> 25:27.226
man, they all start salivating.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.861
As long as he has size...

25:28.961 --> 25:32.198
looks like he has power, they
think they can teach him to hit.

25:32.298 --> 25:33.700
Let me tell you something.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.735
If he hasn't learned how
to hit in 21 years...

25:35.835 --> 25:37.804
it's ain't gonna happen!
It doesn't matter.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.673
It's steroids! That shit is
everywhere in the college game.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.174
Even guys at STAC are doing it.

25:42.274 --> 25:43.710
Then they get drafted,
they get tested in the minors

25:43.810 --> 25:45.111
and they have to stop
doing it...

25:45.211 --> 25:46.813
and then they end up getting
dropped in a year

25:46.913 --> 25:49.015
but it takes spots away
from guys like Maz...

25:49.115 --> 25:52.785

ice cream and sprinkles!

miserable, miserable existence.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.209
Shit, I'd give anything
for that.

26:17.309 --> 26:18.845
Fuck, yeah.

26:20.647 --> 26:24.784
Yo, Fotch? You were drafted,
right?

26:24.884 --> 26:26.318
Yeah, I vaguely remember
that, yeah.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.987
It was that long ago, huh?

26:28.087 --> 26:30.757
Well, I'll never forget the day
the horse and carriage...

26:30.857 --> 26:33.059
rode up to my cottage and
delivered the telegram.

26:35.828 --> 26:38.064
So, whatever happened with that?

26:38.164 --> 26:41.300
I hurt my shoulder.
It refused to cooperate.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.136
Uh-huh... and what happened?

26:46.205 --> 26:48.941
I was playing center and I was
trying to throw this guy out

26:49.041 --> 26:54.213
at home and something just
snapped. It was terrible.

26:54.313 --> 26:57.249
I had a SLAP tear.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.186
I tried surgery after surgery,
but nothing worked.

27:00.286 --> 27:04.323
Finally the doctor, he suggested
something more experimental...

27:04.423 --> 27:07.159
and I just had to let it go.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.928
Do you have a gnarly scar?

27:09.028 --> 27:10.129
Yeah.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.198
Can I see it?

27:12.298 --> 27:13.933
Sure.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.705
There it is.
Oh, shit.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.708
Whoa, hey, man,
that looks pretty bad-ass.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.075
So, at least you got that.

27:23.175 --> 27:24.911
Yeah, I lost 35 percent
of my range of motion...

27:25.011 --> 27:27.179
and I'm highly vulnerable to
re-injury, so--

27:27.279 --> 27:30.917
You're like Samuel L. Jackson
from Unbreakable.

27:31.017 --> 27:33.152
So why do you even do
this league?

27:33.252 --> 27:34.821
Well, I play first base now
obviously...

27:34.921 --> 27:37.123
'cause there's a lot
less throwing.

27:37.223 --> 27:42.795
But... ah... it's the game,
it's got a hold on me.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.232

to get your uniform dirty!

next time and we won't be in

Yeah, yeah, now I remember
where I know this guy from.

28:25.972 --> 28:30.009
Yeah, he was that 'lights out'
closer for St. Thomas Aquinas
this year

28:30.109 --> 28:32.945
except when they got to the
conference playoffs

28:33.045 --> 28:38.150

and STAC was eliminated.

don't worry if this guy
pitches tough now, okay?

he chokes it away!

know about bench bets?

drafted from those leagues.

it to go through all that again.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.533
Not a great start.

35:04.236 --> 35:06.338
Strike one.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.006
Strike two.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.341
Strike three!

35:09.441 --> 35:12.878
Wow, same pitch...
you fucking idiot.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.016
Son of a biscuit!

35:18.184 --> 35:20.186
See, the problem is you're just
not getting your hands inside
the ball enough.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.853
It's that simple.

35:21.953 --> 35:26.492
That's not the problem, Garvey.
The problem is I'm terrible.

35:26.592 --> 35:27.693
Strike two.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.295
Ah, you gotta be kidding me!

35:29.395 --> 35:32.298
If it's low, let it go,
you know?

35:32.398 --> 35:34.200
Say it with me. If it's low--

35:34.266 --> 35:36.535
Okay, you don't have to say it,
but if it's low, let it go.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.737
Just stay away from anything
that's low and inside, alright?

35:38.837 --> 35:40.672
It's not your strength.
It's not your strength.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.541
You gotta lot of strengths,
that's not one of them.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.449
Oh, forget it.
Strike three, you're gone!

35:59.291 --> 36:00.692
[UMPIRE HAZE] Strike three!

36:02.261 --> 36:03.895
Strike three!

36:05.831 --> 36:08.434
Mine! Mine!

36:09.768 --> 36:11.437
Made that shit look pretty.

36:11.537 --> 36:15.073
Two hands, two hands over your
head, just like that.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.276
You see what I'm doing right
there? Just guide that baby in.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.910
All right? And you...

36:19.010 --> 36:21.112
Dells, I really think that if
you went with a two-seamer...

36:21.247 --> 36:22.348
instead of the change-up--

36:22.448 --> 36:24.316
I don't have a two-seamer,
Garvey.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.819
Strike three!

36:27.919 --> 36:32.258
( BASEBALL CHATTER )

36:32.324 --> 36:34.426
Oh, boy, oh, shit!

36:35.261 --> 36:36.462
Come on, man.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.164
Yeah, I'm showing bunt.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.799
I'm showing bunt
and then I drop back.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.802
101 here, boys.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.371
Get comfortable, we're gonna
be here a while.

36:45.471 --> 36:46.705
I like to work the count.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.774
Foul off some pitches.
You know how it is.

36:50.476 --> 36:51.843
I bailed a little bit.

36:51.943 --> 36:55.080
I bailed it a little bit.
I can call my own here.

36:55.281 --> 36:56.915
But now I'm dialed.

36:57.015 --> 36:58.417
Now I'm in the zone.

36:58.517 --> 37:01.620
Get ready to turn around, pitch.
This shit's gone--

37:01.720 --> 37:03.622
Strike three.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.625
Good stuff. Good delivery.
Good deception. See ya'.

37:08.494 --> 37:11.162
Keep it nice and tight.
Nice and tight.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.664
You know? Keep it in.
Keep that elbow in.

37:12.764 --> 37:15.767
There's nothing wrong with
serving one into the outfield.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.736
You know what I mean?

37:17.836 --> 37:19.338
Wait, were you talking to me
this whole time?

37:19.438 --> 37:20.839
You know I'm not playing, right?

37:20.939 --> 37:22.808
Hm... hm.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.943
I'm just saying, I think if you
were to develop a two-seamer...

37:25.043 --> 37:27.679
it would make you a hell
of a lot more dynamic
against a team like this.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.815
I'm pitching a two-hitter,
Garvey!

37:31.583 --> 37:34.620
That's two too many.
That's two too many.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.155
All right?

37:37.323 --> 37:38.524
Strike three!
Are you fucking serious?

37:38.624 --> 37:40.158
They don't get any better
than that.

37:40.326 --> 37:41.560
Is that a joke?
I coulda' hit that.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.762
Come on. I mean, dude,
it was way outside my zone.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.498
Way outside, both ways!
Both ways, blue.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.567
I mean, come on.
You got nothing to say.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.437
There's an earthiness to his
tone that is unparalleled.

37:51.537 --> 37:52.971
Okay? His voice is transcendent.

37:53.071 --> 37:56.174
Brian is the emotional core of
the band! Okay, end of story.

37:56.408 --> 37:57.543
Thank you, David!

37:57.643 --> 37:58.944
Nick is the guy people
wanna hear, man.

37:59.044 --> 38:00.446
It's always been about Nick.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.180
Think of it this way, okay?
All of their hits...

38:02.348 --> 38:03.815
Nick starts every single
one of them.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.917
Because he's Brian's opening
act, you fucking idiot!

38:06.017 --> 38:07.353
Oh, whatever, man.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.687
Just shut up,
you little corn cob.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.522
A.J.'s the one who can't
be ignored, obviously.

38:10.622 --> 38:13.359
He smolders... just smoke, man.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.627
On one hand, he's like,
'Yo, I don't give a shit''

38:15.727 --> 38:17.195
On the other hand, he's like...

38:17.363 --> 38:18.697
'I'm gonna nonchalantly slap...

38:18.797 --> 38:20.632
your grandma with the best
fucking vocals you ever heard.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.534
You know I've heard some shit
before, Barone...

38:22.634 --> 38:24.235
but that is the biggest one
I ever heard.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.505
You know you like him 'cause he
bloody well looks like you.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.707
Yeah, he does.
He's a very attractive man.

38:28.807 --> 38:29.941
If bone structure is a
consideration...

38:30.041 --> 38:31.377
which it should be.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.478
Bone structure's nothing
to do with it.

38:32.578 --> 38:35.381
This is straight-up vocal
talent!

38:35.447 --> 38:36.715
[UMPIRE HAZE]
Strike three! You're gone!

38:36.815 --> 38:38.617
This is how it goes.
No, what it is--

38:41.387 --> 38:43.254
Just shut up! All right, we're
gonna settle this right now.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.090
Shut up, first one in.
Whatever.

38:45.190 --> 38:48.860
Hey, Zapata, how are you?
Question.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.762
Objectively speaking...

38:50.862 --> 38:54.065
who is the greatest
Backstreet Boy of all time?

38:54.400 --> 38:55.401
Brian.

38:55.434 --> 38:59.838
And you can put it
on the board!

38:59.938 --> 39:03.074
Yes, how does that taste?

39:03.174 --> 39:05.110
No, no, wait... you said Brian?

39:05.411 --> 39:07.078
Yeah.
Nick.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.080
No! You already said Brian.
Bullshit.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.116
He's already said Brian--
get your hand out of my face!

39:11.216 --> 39:14.420
Don't you touch that money!
Don't you touch that money!

39:14.486 --> 39:17.022
Give me my money back.
Put that money back down!

39:17.122 --> 39:18.490
That's it!

39:18.590 --> 39:20.992
The integrity of the bet
has been compromised.

39:21.092 --> 39:24.062
Bench bets are over, again...

39:24.162 --> 39:27.933
for the second and final time.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.435
Fine.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.808
As a side note, can we just
agree that Justin Timberlake

39:36.908 --> 39:39.445
is a blatant rip off of Nick
Carter in every single way...

39:39.545 --> 39:41.547
and doesn't hold a candle
to his vocal prowess?

39:41.647 --> 39:43.348
I mean... was that ever
in doubt, though?

39:43.449 --> 39:46.585
JT thinks he's so cool.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.887
You can call it a strike,
if you want, all day long.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.722
I don't care. That's your job...
by all means.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.458
Ump... I'm hoping you're gonna
umpire the game...

39:52.524 --> 39:54.092
because you haven't been doing
it all day.

39:54.192 --> 39:55.994
I'm not gonna swing at a pitch
that's a foot outside--

39:56.094 --> 39:57.463
Foul ball!

39:57.529 --> 40:00.632
But call it a strike.
Call it a strike.

40:12.478 --> 40:15.781
Foul ball! Strike two.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.082
Time!
What?

40:17.182 --> 40:18.750
What are you calling time for?

40:18.850 --> 40:22.420
Don't worry, all right?
I got this. Yeah!

40:25.957 --> 40:27.859
What's up?

40:27.959 --> 40:29.928
So, I'm over in the dugout,
right? And I'm watching your
last at-bat.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.830
And I'm watching this one,
I'm sitting there thinking...

40:31.930 --> 40:34.666
"Garvey, what can I do? Tell Maz
you're a little off right now."

40:34.766 --> 40:37.068
And I realized, the second the
pitcher goes into the wind-up--

40:37.168 --> 40:38.837
Garvey!

40:40.706 --> 40:42.474
The day that I need advice
from you...

40:42.574 --> 40:44.810
is the day that I kill myself.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.947
Oh, shit! Smackdown!

40:49.047 --> 40:50.148
Yeah, Garv!

40:52.651 --> 40:55.721
Come on, Garv,
bring it back in here, buddy!

40:55.821 --> 40:57.623
Aw! So real!

40:57.723 --> 41:00.025
Walk it off.
The pain is so fresh.

This will be a fast ball,
right down the middle.

Why didn't you run?

been out by a fucking mile.

fucking backstop!

would have scored you!

uniform clean...

will be happy...

Kind of dumb of me to give
you advice, anyway.

of worked... I got a hit.

need me to annoy you again...

isn't he?

let him get it out.

with that boy.
