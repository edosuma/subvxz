WEBVTT

00:02.965 --> 00:05.410
Well, I'm back from my
stupid Soul Spin job,

00:05.416 --> 00:07.372
and I'm about to go
to my stupid diner job.

00:07.378 --> 00:09.774
I hate it all, I have minimum wage rage.

00:11.689 --> 00:12.889
Hey.

00:12.895 --> 00:15.114
What are you sad about?
You're making cupcakes.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.523
Oh, did you eat the first batch?

00:18.330 --> 00:21.019
No! Elliot and Alan's
little foster daughter's

00:21.025 --> 00:22.829
coming today, and I'm
making her cupcakes, but

00:22.835 --> 00:24.649
all this talk about a
little girl without her mom,

00:24.654 --> 00:25.961
it's making me miss mine.

00:25.968 --> 00:28.511
Yeah, well, your mom
was very sweet and...

00:28.517 --> 00:30.554
- warm and chocolatey...
- Take one.

00:31.764 --> 00:34.734
Sometimes I wish I could just pick up
the phone and tell her that I love her.

00:34.739 --> 00:36.951
- (Sophia) Mm.
- You know what? I am gonna call her.

00:36.957 --> 00:38.872
- Who?
- My mom.

00:38.878 --> 00:41.873
Gabi... your mom passed
away five years ago.

00:41.879 --> 00:43.459
You know she's not gonna pick up.

00:43.465 --> 00:44.774
Yeah, you're right.

00:44.889 --> 00:46.162
I'm gonna text her.

00:46.173 --> 00:47.373
Gabi.

00:47.379 --> 00:49.594
I'm just gonna text "I
love you" to her old number.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.644
There, I did it. Done.

00:51.662 --> 00:52.862
Do you feel better?

00:52.868 --> 00:54.267
Well, I'd feel better if she responded.

00:54.272 --> 00:55.472
(phone dings)

01:00.164 --> 01:01.820
- Should I look?
- Yes!

01:01.826 --> 01:03.026
No, I'm scared.

01:03.032 --> 01:05.104
You look. No, no,
I'll look. I'm looking.

01:05.343 --> 01:08.448
(gasp) "I love you too,
whoever you are." (gasps)

01:11.994 --> 01:13.982
- Should I tell them who I are?
- Yes.

01:13.988 --> 01:18.717
Okay, okay, okay. Um,
this is Gabi. Who are you?

01:19.136 --> 01:20.919
- (phone dings)
- Peter Gabe D'Angelo,

01:20.925 --> 01:23.206
- who's Peter Gabe D'Angelo?
- I don't know! I don't know!

01:23.979 --> 01:26.340
- Let's look him up.
- Okay...

01:27.738 --> 01:29.802
Uh, do you think this

01:29.808 --> 01:32.034
- (high pitch) could be Peter Gabe D...
- Yes, please!

01:32.040 --> 01:33.278
Oh, my God!

01:33.611 --> 01:35.659
He freelances for
<i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>Spin!</i>

01:35.665 --> 01:37.769
(gasps) Oh, my God.

01:37.775 --> 01:39.644
Sofia, do you know what this means?

01:39.650 --> 01:43.318
My mom is setting me up with
my soul mate from heaven!

01:45.237 --> 01:47.573
Okay, can you send her a text
and see if she can find me

01:47.579 --> 01:49.971
a decent full-time job that
I feel passionate about?

01:50.930 --> 01:53.428
Okay, fine, but when your
mom dies, she totally owes me.

01:54.274 --> 01:56.274
(theme music playing)

01:59.540 --> 02:01.732
<i>♪ She in the spotlight</i>

02:01.738 --> 02:03.500
<i>♪ And she turn my head</i>

02:03.506 --> 02:05.479
<i>♪ She run a red light</i>

02:05.485 --> 02:07.281

02:07.287 --> 02:11.076

02:15.148 --> 02:16.738
I'm loving today.

02:16.744 --> 02:18.978
Alan and Elliot's foster
daughter gets here,

02:18.984 --> 02:20.923
my mom set me up with my soul mate,

02:20.929 --> 02:23.797
and I finally have a reason
to shave above my knees.

02:24.816 --> 02:27.797
Gabala, no offense but you're
gonna have to watch the dirty talk

02:27.803 --> 02:29.466
in front of our new little princess.

02:29.472 --> 02:32.627
Yeah, she's only three.
Gabi, that's this many!

02:34.628 --> 02:36.508
I hope Keisha likes princesses.

02:36.522 --> 02:38.819
You better hope she likes queens.

02:39.290 --> 02:43.803
Wait a sec... does that mean
I have to watch my mouth too?

02:44.253 --> 02:46.109
What about... drinking?

02:46.115 --> 02:49.116
And the occasional
tokedy-toke of a smokedy-smoke?

02:49.659 --> 02:52.770
Relax. We're all here to
support you and Keisha.

02:52.776 --> 02:54.606
I can't wait to spoil her
rotten the way my absent,

02:54.611 --> 02:56.635
emotionally shut-down
father never did for me.

02:56.641 --> 02:57.910
Not that I'm holding a grudge.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.789
And she's gonna love her godmother!

03:01.795 --> 03:06.352
Oh, no! No, no, no!

03:06.358 --> 03:08.718
Oh, yes! Get on the train.

03:08.724 --> 03:10.905
We're gonna need all the
help we can get, sweetie.

03:10.911 --> 03:13.340
Keisha's black, Yolanda's
black, black is the new orange,

03:13.346 --> 03:16.246
and orange you glad we're getting a
three-year-old, and I'm freaking out!

03:16.958 --> 03:18.725
- (knock on door)
- She's here!

03:18.731 --> 03:21.577
I'll get it... no, you get
it. We should both get it.

03:22.762 --> 03:26.829
Oh, my God. I've never been this
excited to meet a girl in my life!

03:28.360 --> 03:29.965
Open the door!

03:32.194 --> 03:34.379
Hi, guys, this is Keisha.

03:34.385 --> 03:36.558
Damn, this place is huge.

03:37.341 --> 03:39.227
Come in, angel.

03:39.233 --> 03:42.004
Bat Mitzvah-aged angel.

03:42.540 --> 03:45.057
I'm Alan, and this
is my husband, Elliot.

03:45.063 --> 03:47.415
Please tell me those two
are my foster parents,

03:47.421 --> 03:49.771
and these are my funny, gay uncles.

03:50.204 --> 03:52.225
(whispering) She has go
to back! She's a hundred!

03:52.614 --> 03:55.261
(whispering) There's obviously
been some kind of mistake.

03:55.267 --> 03:57.675
Why is there baby stuff everywhere?

03:57.994 --> 04:00.729
Oh, I get it, you thought
you were getting a little kid?

04:00.735 --> 04:02.448
- No-o...
- Yes!

04:03.525 --> 04:06.210
Miss Higgs, maybe we should
talk in the other room.

04:06.406 --> 04:08.157
So, uh, are you hungry?

04:08.163 --> 04:10.728
Yeah, ah, Gabi can make
you anything you want,

04:10.734 --> 04:15.715
and remember, I pay her, so it's like
I'm making you anything... you want!

04:16.911 --> 04:19.656
So, what do you want for breakfast?
How do you like your eggs?

04:19.670 --> 04:22.539
In a "to go" box? I'm
not gonna be here long.

04:22.545 --> 04:23.848
Wha-what do you mean?

04:23.854 --> 04:26.593
Those two are gonna be just like
all of my other foster parents.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.852
Why do you think they're in
there talking to Miss Higgs?

04:28.990 --> 04:30.466
Well, maybe they're in there

04:30.472 --> 04:33.135
thanking her for bringing
them you, instead of some

04:33.141 --> 04:35.627
sticky, whiny, germy three-year-old.

04:36.546 --> 04:40.731
Aw, well look at you... all
white and cute and hopeful.

04:44.293 --> 04:48.249
Gabi, maybe Keisha's
godmother should handle this.

04:50.383 --> 04:52.409
Oh, baby girl...

04:52.415 --> 04:55.611
Don't "baby girl" me. I'm not your baby.

04:55.617 --> 04:59.140
You might be. I made a
lotta mistakes in 2003.

04:59.762 --> 05:03.283
Okay! All right! I got this. Ladies?

05:05.356 --> 05:08.418
How about a smart watch, tablet?
How about some blue chip stock?

05:08.424 --> 05:10.391
Stop trying to impress me.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.334
There's no way queer eye and
the fat guy are gonna keep me.

05:16.068 --> 05:17.634
- We're not keeping her.
- Elliot,

05:17.640 --> 05:20.261
we can't just return her like
she's an ugly cardigan from J. Crew.

05:20.267 --> 05:21.953
I knew you hated that present!

05:22.411 --> 05:24.742
Look. Miss Higgs, can
I be honest with you?

05:24.748 --> 05:26.135
We ordered a three-year-old!

05:26.141 --> 05:27.737
Can I be honest with you?

05:27.750 --> 05:31.849
A bi-racial middle-aged gay couple
is not on every kid's wish list.

05:31.855 --> 05:34.999
And no one's knocking down the
door for 13-year-old Keisha.

05:35.005 --> 05:36.890
I thought this would be a perfect match.

05:36.896 --> 05:39.127
- Nobody wanted Keisha?
- Don't go soft, Alan.

05:39.588 --> 05:42.620
Miss Higgs, do you mind
giving us a moment to discuss?

05:42.626 --> 05:45.156
You can wait right out
here on the lovely terrace.

05:45.162 --> 05:47.972
I don't have all day, I have
other couples to disappoint.

05:50.319 --> 05:51.926
We're not keeping her!

05:51.932 --> 05:54.750
Did you not hear what Miss Higgs
just said? Nobody wants Keisha.

05:54.756 --> 05:57.304
Of course not! She's old and homophobic.

05:57.310 --> 05:59.275
If we wanted that,
we'd take in my grandma.

05:59.281 --> 06:01.884
Sweetie, I understand
you're in shock. We didn't

06:01.890 --> 06:04.815
- get the three-year-old we wanted.
- I didn't even want the three-year-old!

06:04.820 --> 06:06.196
- What?
- (Elliot sighs)

06:06.202 --> 06:09.027
I was going along with it for you.

06:09.230 --> 06:12.724
I wanna spend my life with you!

06:12.923 --> 06:16.099
Go on romantic cruises... with you.

06:16.264 --> 06:19.705
Get plastic surgeries to
look younger... with you!

06:19.930 --> 06:22.658
And I wanna do all
those things with you!

06:22.664 --> 06:25.350
But I also wanna be a
father and have a family.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.361
Come on. We can be the
parents we always wanted.

06:28.367 --> 06:31.019
Open, accepting, theater-camp friendly.

06:32.060 --> 06:33.277
Please, Elliot?

06:34.983 --> 06:36.859
One week! We'll try it for one week!

06:36.865 --> 06:40.438
- But if she does anything...
- She won't! We're havin' a baby!

06:40.851 --> 06:43.251
A 13-year-old baby!

06:50.136 --> 06:52.386
- What do you think?
- (flatly) Ta-da!

06:52.863 --> 06:55.822
It looks like Tinker
Bell threw up in here.

06:55.836 --> 06:57.989
I thought you people were
supposed to have good taste?

06:58.523 --> 06:59.731
"You people"?

06:59.736 --> 07:01.048
We can redecorate!

07:01.054 --> 07:05.011
We're gay, Jewish and Asian. It'll
be stylish, cheap, and feng shui-ed.

07:05.810 --> 07:07.053
Okay, time for bed.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.734
Elliot, wait. We need to
get to know each other.

07:09.740 --> 07:12.035
Keisha, I want you to feel comfortable.

07:12.041 --> 07:15.807
So if there's anything you need
or wanna ask us, go right ahead.

07:16.611 --> 07:18.079
Where's the TV?

07:19.126 --> 07:21.737
Oh, uh, we didn't put a TV in your room.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.141
But Alan got you one of these things

07:24.147 --> 07:26.758
where you pull the lever and
it makes the animal noises?

07:27.349 --> 07:29.154
Ba-a-a-a-a!

07:31.925 --> 07:35.971
But... I-I can't sleep without a TV.

07:38.657 --> 07:40.682
Of course you can't.

07:40.842 --> 07:42.957
She can't sleep without a TV.

07:43.580 --> 07:46.145
You know what, honey? You
can take our room tonight.

07:46.151 --> 07:48.001
- Wha...!
- There's a TV in there.

07:48.007 --> 07:50.053
What? What?

07:50.059 --> 07:51.897
We'll just lock the second drawer.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.670
It's the final night of
<i>The Bachelorette</i> and I wanna

07:55.676 --> 07:58.416
- know who gets the final rose.
- That's what a DVR is for.

07:58.422 --> 08:00.144
But you have to watch the finale live,

08:00.150 --> 08:01.627
or everybody will know
everything before me,

08:01.632 --> 08:03.235
and I won't get to see the drama unfold.

08:05.047 --> 08:09.110
It's okay. I don't need a TV.
I'll just cry myself to sleep.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.515
Oh, she's good.

08:14.285 --> 08:17.392
Okay. I know this is
a little uncomfortable,

08:17.794 --> 08:20.007
but being a parent is
all about sacrifice.

08:20.013 --> 08:22.702
Trust me, it'll be the most
rewarding thing we've ever done.

08:22.708 --> 08:26.688
(Keisha) Oh, my God! She picked the
ex-con who works at the pre-school!

08:34.344 --> 08:35.852
Good morning.

08:36.306 --> 08:38.269
Hey! Just in time for breakfast.

08:38.275 --> 08:41.461
Good, I'm starving. All they gave me
to eat was an onion-flavored donut.

08:41.467 --> 08:42.821
It was a bagel!

08:45.733 --> 08:48.860
Keisha... why don't you
go eat your breakfast

08:48.866 --> 08:51.547
- out on the terrace?
- So you can talk about me?

08:51.553 --> 08:53.358
- No...
- Your dude wife said

08:53.364 --> 08:55.190
we were supposed to be
honest with each other.

08:57.151 --> 09:00.470
Fine, go outside so
I can talk about you.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.185
Last night was a nightmare.

09:06.190 --> 09:09.497
Alan and I were up till four in
the morning fighting about Keisha!

09:09.503 --> 09:11.550
- Why, what happened?
- She took our bedroom

09:11.556 --> 09:14.355
and our TV, and we had to
sleep in the princess bed.

09:14.494 --> 09:16.246
If the shoe fits...

09:17.702 --> 09:20.625
Get ready to learn from the master!

09:21.302 --> 09:25.169
I raised three kids. And
two of 'em still talk to me.

09:26.236 --> 09:27.538
Can I have some bacon?

09:27.544 --> 09:29.289
Oh, of course, baby!

09:29.295 --> 09:31.433
And then maybe later
we can go to a movie,

09:31.438 --> 09:33.666
and get some Chinese food,
and ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

09:33.672 --> 09:35.128
and then we can knock on the door

09:35.134 --> 09:37.546
of one of my exes, and you
can scare the crap out of him

09:37.552 --> 09:39.369
by saying, "Hey, Daddy."

09:41.449 --> 09:43.561
- Pass.
- What the hell?

09:44.707 --> 09:47.372
Hey-y, Keisha!

09:47.378 --> 09:49.955
Look what your super
cool Uncle Joshy got you.

09:49.961 --> 09:53.374
Your very own 3D printer, where
you can print any gift you want!

09:53.380 --> 09:54.660
The only limit...

09:54.666 --> 09:56.099
(breathy) is your imagination.

09:56.999 --> 09:58.459
Pass.

09:59.143 --> 10:00.847
See? She's impossible.

10:00.853 --> 10:02.053
Honesty.

10:02.648 --> 10:04.287
You're impossible!

10:05.210 --> 10:07.430
Guys, she's not impossible,
she's a teenager.

10:07.436 --> 10:09.678
If you want her to have fun,
just do something she likes.

10:09.684 --> 10:11.063
Take her to mall and go shopping.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.756
Now that's what I'm talking
about. Can I kick it with you?

10:13.762 --> 10:17.344
Yes! Kick it with her!

10:18.187 --> 10:20.218
Josh, is it okay if I
take Keisha to the mall?

10:20.224 --> 10:21.952
Is it? I'll tell you what.

10:22.257 --> 10:24.590
Why don't you take my platinum card,

10:24.746 --> 10:27.747
and get Keisha a nice jacket
that'll keep her warm on her...

10:27.753 --> 10:29.503
hot air balloon ride!

10:30.140 --> 10:31.472
Pass.

10:35.509 --> 10:38.493
I'm telling you, every dress
you tried on looked poppin'.

10:38.499 --> 10:39.946
I think I love you.

10:40.109 --> 10:42.472
Well, it's probably 'cause
you have such a bangin' body.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.197
Yeah, I know I love you.

10:44.747 --> 10:46.348
You're the only one who does.

10:46.354 --> 10:50.124
Oh, come on, Keisha. Hey, Josh
likes you. Ah, Yolanda likes you.

10:50.130 --> 10:51.403
Alan likes you.

10:51.409 --> 10:52.923
- Elliot...
- Doesn't.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.160
Yeah, but Elliot doesn't
like anybody at first.

10:55.166 --> 10:58.177
When he first met me,
he-he hated me. But now...

10:58.642 --> 11:00.265
Well, this story's going nowhere.

11:00.955 --> 11:05.299
Look, I get it. I'm 13, annoying, and
I got a big mouth. Everyone says so.

11:05.305 --> 11:07.440
Yeah, but that's how
teenagers are supposed to be.

11:07.446 --> 11:09.752
Hey, when I was your age,
I was a total nightmare.

11:09.758 --> 11:11.422
- Yeah, right.
- No, I was.

11:11.428 --> 11:14.697
I cheated on tests, I snuck out
to see boys, I had a fake I.D.

11:14.703 --> 11:16.528
What'd you do, use it to buy booze?

11:16.534 --> 11:19.376
No, I actually just wanted to
go to this dance club in Tampa,

11:19.382 --> 11:21.637
but you had to be 18 to get in, so...

11:21.643 --> 11:25.943
I went to a smoke shop, and boom.
Zora Martinez, nineteen, Scorpio.

11:26.801 --> 11:29.250
Well, you gotta know your sign,
'cause bouncers are gonna ask.

11:30.297 --> 11:32.702
And they didn't ask
about the "Martinez"?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.446
They did and that's how I got busted.

11:35.602 --> 11:38.900
I got grounded for two
weeks. But my mom understood.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.372
She even showed me her fake
I.D. from when she was my age.

11:41.378 --> 11:42.627
She was cool like that.

11:42.633 --> 11:43.928
You two still close?

11:44.282 --> 11:45.604
Well, she passed away.

11:45.610 --> 11:46.893
That sucks.

11:47.234 --> 11:48.880
My mom's dead too.

11:48.886 --> 11:51.710
Oh, Keisha, I'm sorry.
Do you still talk to her?

11:52.296 --> 11:54.422
Ah, I just said she's dead.

11:54.428 --> 11:56.393
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean you can't talk to her.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.929
I talk to my mom all the time.

11:57.935 --> 11:59.141
Really?

11:59.147 --> 12:01.562
Yeah, hey, let's just
say if it wasn't for her,

12:01.568 --> 12:04.421
I would not be going out with this guy.

12:04.427 --> 12:06.351
- Check him out.
- Oh, I'm gonna check

12:06.357 --> 12:07.692
out every inch of his...

12:07.954 --> 12:09.315
personality.

12:13.457 --> 12:15.282
Hey! How's the pizza?

12:15.341 --> 12:18.327
Stale and unfulfilling...
like my career.

12:18.763 --> 12:20.940
Mm. Okay, well, have fun.

12:20.946 --> 12:24.160
I am off on my date with a
hot, supercool music journalist.

12:24.166 --> 12:27.100
Oh! I can't believe you get
to go backstage and meet Drake!

12:27.106 --> 12:29.418
Mm-hmm, well hey, listen, if
it makes you feel any better,

12:29.424 --> 12:32.708
it's not for fun, you know? It's
his job. He has to write a review.

12:32.714 --> 12:34.087
I just get to go with him!

12:34.093 --> 12:35.293
(knock on door)

12:38.309 --> 12:42.805
Hi! Wow, guy who has my mom's old
number, you're real and you're cute.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.901
Hey, I'm Sofia.

12:45.655 --> 12:47.811
I really liked your article
on the breakup of Journey.

12:47.817 --> 12:49.897
"Do Stop Believing," thank you.

12:50.327 --> 12:52.438
- Gabi, we gotta get going.
- Oh, right, you gotta

12:52.444 --> 12:55.005
get there early so you can take
notes and really capture the moment?

12:55.010 --> 12:58.044
No, I ate a special brownie
and it is about to kick in.

13:00.718 --> 13:04.421
You two have fun at the concert. I'm so
glad good things keep happening to you.

13:04.427 --> 13:05.934
(Gabi's phone rings)

13:05.940 --> 13:07.266
Oh, hang on one second.

13:07.552 --> 13:10.846
Oh, it's my co-worker. He's, ah,
probably just calling to thank me,

13:10.852 --> 13:13.147
I spent the day with his foster
daughter, we totally bonded and,

13:13.152 --> 13:15.890
kind of her mentor.
You're welcome, Elliot.

13:16.242 --> 13:18.423
What? When?

13:18.570 --> 13:21.231
Okay, I'm on my way. Um,
Keisha ran away, I gotta go.

13:21.237 --> 13:23.619
- Oh, my God...
- Yeah, listen, Peter, I'm really sorry.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.011
I was really looking forward to
tonight, but I gotta get going.

13:26.016 --> 13:28.021
W-well, Gabi, is there
anything I can do?

13:28.027 --> 13:32.419
Um... actually, yeah! Will you go
to the concert with my soul mate?

13:32.426 --> 13:35.529
I don't want him to like, meet
anybody 'cause he's my soul mate.

13:37.742 --> 13:39.008
No pressure.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.906
- Can't believe she ran away.
- We're the worst parents ever.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.387
Guys, don't blame yourselves.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.245
I don't. I blame her.

13:49.791 --> 13:51.349
What? Me? What did I do?

13:51.355 --> 13:53.679
You were the last person
to spend time with Keisha.

13:53.685 --> 13:55.618
What did you say to her
to make her run away?

13:55.699 --> 13:57.988
Nothing, I mean, we just
went to the mall, and then

13:57.994 --> 14:00.754
- we went to the diner for milkshakes.
- What kind?

14:01.290 --> 14:03.726
What? Every detail could be a clue.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.644
Think, Gabala, think.

14:05.650 --> 14:07.900
Did she say anything that
might suggest she'd run away?

14:07.906 --> 14:11.261
Spit it out, bitch! Everybody knows the
first few hours are the most important!

14:11.267 --> 14:13.395
I mean, we just talked
about girl stuff, you know,

14:13.401 --> 14:17.327
like clothes and music and
how both our moms are dead.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.681
Keisha's mom's not dead.

14:18.687 --> 14:20.335
- What? But she told me her mom...
- Keisha's mom's

14:20.340 --> 14:23.555
been in a prison upstate for the
last three years. It was in her file.

14:24.109 --> 14:25.733
But why would she lie?

14:25.739 --> 14:28.303
Would you wanna tell someone
your mom was in the big house?

14:28.562 --> 14:29.949
My kids didn't.

14:34.425 --> 14:35.645
Oh, my God, you know what?

14:35.651 --> 14:38.582
Uh, I told her that I do everything
I can to stay connected with my mom.

14:38.588 --> 14:40.472
Do you think she went to
to visit her in prison?

14:40.478 --> 14:42.324
How? She doesn't have money.

14:42.331 --> 14:43.873
Actually...

14:45.673 --> 14:47.047
she may have $500.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.399
Joshua, you didn't!

14:49.405 --> 14:52.429
I just... I wanted her to like
me! All my presents were tanking.

14:52.563 --> 14:54.497
Okay, everybody slow your damn roll.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.487
Now, a kid just can't go visit a prison.

14:56.493 --> 14:58.999
They have to be with an adult or be 18.

14:59.628 --> 15:01.131
Actually...

15:01.199 --> 15:04.341
I may have told her you can
buy a fake I.D. at a smoke shop.

15:04.347 --> 15:06.299
Gabala, you didn't.

15:06.305 --> 15:07.537
Gabala did.

15:08.773 --> 15:12.106
Okay, here's the plan. Yolanda, you're
gonna stay here in case she comes back,

15:12.112 --> 15:14.713
the rest of us will divide up, we'll
hit every smoke shop in the area.

15:14.718 --> 15:16.717
- We'll meet at the diner in an hour.
- Okay.

15:18.190 --> 15:19.390
Uch!

15:19.972 --> 15:21.870
Looks like Tinker Bell threw up in here.

15:25.937 --> 15:28.976
Okay, so I know your
article is due in two hours,

15:28.982 --> 15:31.142
and you were nice enough
to introduce me to Drake, so

15:31.148 --> 15:32.943
I'm gonna brew you a fresh pot of coffee

15:32.949 --> 15:34.650
so you can start your article...

15:34.656 --> 15:35.856
P...

15:37.337 --> 15:38.537
Peter?

15:38.914 --> 15:40.114
Peter!

15:40.120 --> 15:41.320
Hey!

15:41.326 --> 15:42.526
Oh!

15:42.532 --> 15:44.866
- (moaning)
- Ah, again...

15:44.872 --> 15:47.007
- Peter... just... just...
- (moaning)

15:50.635 --> 15:51.835
Type!

15:58.511 --> 16:02.513
Okay, how about this? Uh,
you dictate and I will type.

16:03.550 --> 16:06.287
The cloud was maglical...

16:08.831 --> 16:11.486
Do you mean the crowd was magical?

16:11.491 --> 16:14.676
Good. That... you're good!

16:14.890 --> 16:17.364
The music was...

16:18.300 --> 16:20.786
Uh... Peter. Peter!

16:20.792 --> 16:22.696
Hey! You gotta wake up
and write this review.

16:22.702 --> 16:24.626
I don't wanna. You do it.

16:25.711 --> 16:27.596
But I-I'm not a writer.

16:27.602 --> 16:29.606
Pwe-e-ease?

16:30.741 --> 16:34.102
I really need this job.
I'm in so much debt.

16:34.797 --> 16:37.256
Rehab is so expensive.

16:41.850 --> 16:43.708
Okay. Well, won't be the first time

16:43.714 --> 16:45.928
a guy passes out on me and
I have to do all the work.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.635
We've been to eight smoke
shops and still no Keisha.

16:55.641 --> 16:56.907
Alan, what are we gonna do?

16:56.913 --> 17:00.040
We're gonna ditch these
patchouli-soaked jackets and soldier on!

17:00.939 --> 17:03.917
You look up the bus lines, I'm
gonna find the number for the prison.

17:04.267 --> 17:06.108
Any word from Gabi and Josh?

17:06.114 --> 17:09.579
They're on their way here, but
they haven't found her, either.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.673
Nothing for me. I'm too upset.

17:11.679 --> 17:14.742
Me neither, I can't eat at a time
like this. Two root beer floats.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.016
How could I have trusted our
daughter with Gabi. I'll tell you how!

17:20.021 --> 17:22.355
I wasn't thinking! And now look what...

17:22.361 --> 17:24.612
- You said "our daughter."
- No, I didn't.

17:24.617 --> 17:28.812
Yes, you did. You called Keisha
our daughter. You like her.

17:28.819 --> 17:32.188
Like her? I've got such
a knot in my stomach,

17:32.194 --> 17:36.009
I can barely eat. I c-can't
breathe. She's killing me!

17:36.015 --> 17:37.662
It's called worry, Elliot.

17:37.668 --> 17:40.540
This is exactly why I wanted
to bring a child into our lives.

17:40.546 --> 17:43.227
They make everything better
even when they worry you sick.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.890
Well, I don't like it. If
anything happens to her...

17:45.896 --> 17:49.356
Get a grip, you two.
I'm fine. I'm right here!

17:49.362 --> 17:51.790
- Keisha! What are you doing here?
- Oh, my God...

17:51.796 --> 17:54.344
I was just here waiting for
the bus so I could see my mom.

17:54.350 --> 17:56.474
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, while I was waiting

17:56.480 --> 17:58.743
I bought a bunch of
scratchers with Josh's cash.

17:58.749 --> 18:00.110
I was doing them in the corner.

18:00.116 --> 18:01.570
We have to get her stomach pumped!

18:01.575 --> 18:03.141
Those are lottery tickets!

18:03.147 --> 18:04.843
Oh, thank God.

18:05.430 --> 18:09.220
You had us worried sick. You can't
just go running off like that.

18:09.226 --> 18:11.168
Yeah, well, I didn't think you cared.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.435
Neither did I.

18:12.441 --> 18:14.382
I didn't think you wanted me around.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.087
Neither did I!

18:16.615 --> 18:18.617
But he does, and so do I!

18:18.623 --> 18:21.371
And listen, sweetie, if you wanna
go see your mom, we'll take you.

18:21.377 --> 18:25.944
- Seriously?
- Yeah. So hand over that fake I.D.

18:25.950 --> 18:28.153
What fake I... fine!

18:30.961 --> 18:32.597
Beyoncé Rihanna?

18:33.381 --> 18:37.449
Look, I'm sorry I made it seem like
I didn't want you around. It's just...

18:37.455 --> 18:39.799
(sighs) I've never
had a daughter before.

18:39.805 --> 18:41.961
Yeah, well, I've never
had two dads before.

18:41.967 --> 18:44.357
Aw, she called us "dads"!

18:44.363 --> 18:46.791
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

18:47.057 --> 18:49.565
You like us. And you wanna hug us.

18:49.688 --> 18:50.888
Whatever.

18:50.894 --> 18:52.249
That means yes!

18:58.746 --> 19:00.485
- I couldn't find her.
- Me neither.

19:02.569 --> 19:04.127
Oh, my God. There she is.

19:06.883 --> 19:08.456
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:09.346 --> 19:11.023
It looks like they
have it under control.

19:12.247 --> 19:15.256
Look at them! Finally
coming together as a family.

19:15.262 --> 19:16.942
Yeah, and you know, none of this
would've happened if I hadn't

19:16.947 --> 19:19.183
told her about my mom, and told
her where to get a fake I.D.

19:19.188 --> 19:21.480
Hey! Don't forget I'm the one
that gave her all that cash!

19:22.854 --> 19:24.370
We're gonna be great parents.

19:24.644 --> 19:25.844
Yeah, we are.

19:27.203 --> 19:29.942
Hey. I'd like to pay for
everything they're having.

19:29.948 --> 19:33.098
And be sure to let the kid
know, it's from Uncle Joshy.

19:34.811 --> 19:37.561
So you, ah, ever been
in a hot air balloon?

19:37.567 --> 19:38.767
Pass.

19:44.563 --> 19:45.827
Hi.

19:45.914 --> 19:48.230
Whoo, flowers. Who are they from?

19:48.236 --> 19:49.663
- Peter.
- Don't want 'em.

19:49.668 --> 19:51.396
After you told me how
he acted that night,

19:51.402 --> 19:54.478
the only person I want drunkenly
passing out on the couch is Yolanda.

19:55.479 --> 19:59.639
Actually, these are for me for me
for writing that review for him.

19:59.645 --> 20:03.571
Aw, well, he should have sent a maid
for what he did to our bathroom.

20:04.732 --> 20:07.021
Oh, my God. Gabi...

20:07.482 --> 20:09.735
his editor thought the
article was so good,

20:09.741 --> 20:13.961
Peter got me a gig! I'm writing an
article for an indie music blog!

20:13.967 --> 20:16.545
Here are the tickets!
I can't believe it!

20:16.779 --> 20:18.955
Now I'm the cool music journalist!

20:19.532 --> 20:21.941
That's so great, look at
you, with your words!

20:21.947 --> 20:24.697
I know! And I had so much
fun writing that review.

20:24.703 --> 20:27.004
And turns out... I'm really good at it!

20:27.010 --> 20:28.457
Sofia, maybe this is your thing!

20:28.463 --> 20:30.296
- Oh, my God! I have a thing!
- You have a thing!

20:30.301 --> 20:32.102
- I have a thing! Aah!
- You're a writer!

20:32.108 --> 20:33.545
Who knew?

20:33.780 --> 20:35.015
My mom!

20:35.021 --> 20:36.565
You know what, Gabi?

20:36.842 --> 20:39.615
Maybe your mom wasn't leading
