00:06.200 --> 00:10.199
but it's been a good home to us -
to me, Frank Gallagher, and my kids,

00:10.240 --> 00:16.259
who I'm proud of,
cos every single one of them
reminds me a little of...me.

00:17.720 --> 00:21.119
They can all think for themselves,
which they've me to thank for.

00:21.120 --> 00:25.119
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite,
which is why nobody calls him Philip.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.399
Ian, a lot like his mam,
which was handy for the others
when she disappeared into thin air.

00:30.040 --> 00:33.399
And Carl, we daren't let him
grow his hair for two reasons -

00:33.400 --> 00:37.399
one, it makes it stand on end
and makes him look like Toyah,
and two, nits love it.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.439
Debbie! Sent by God. Total angel!
You have to check your change,

00:41.440 --> 00:44.599
but she'll go miles out of
her way to do you a favour.

00:45.100 --> 00:49.099
Plus lickle William, he's gonna be
a star some day. Monica, the wife.

00:49.540 --> 00:53.539
She's back, with her bird in tow.

00:53.900 --> 00:57.699
And we can't get shot of her.
And the neighbours, hey?

00:57.700 --> 01:01.579
The neighbours!
Well, what can you say?

01:01.580 --> 01:05.419
Nothing, if you don't
want your arms breaking.
Still, nobody's perfect.

01:05.420 --> 01:09.219
But all of them, to a man,
know first and foremost

01:09.220 --> 01:13.219
one of the most vital
necessities in life is,
they know how to throw a party!

01:15.820 --> 01:16.819
Scatter!

01:22.100 --> 01:24.939
Blokes and women,
we want different things.

01:24.940 --> 01:25.979
BABY CRIES

01:25.980 --> 01:27.699
She's not happy.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.539
We have totally different skills.

01:29.540 --> 01:33.539
Like men, the ability to
be fully entertained by watching
footy scores on Ceefax.

01:36.380 --> 01:40.339
Women, the ability to remember
everything ever said to them

01:40.340 --> 01:43.539
by anyone about anything,
and to replay any conversation

01:43.540 --> 01:47.539
word-for-word while you're
watching footy scores on Ceefax.

01:47.580 --> 01:50.259
And yet, it totally works.

01:50.260 --> 01:54.259
Because men need women...

01:54.460 --> 01:57.699
And women...need men.

01:57.700 --> 02:01.699
Simple. Perfect, in fact.

02:02.300 --> 02:05.779
There are exceptions, obviously.
Poofs, lezzas...

02:05.780 --> 02:07.179
Anything for
yourself in this house.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.179
..and our Debbie, of course.

02:09.180 --> 02:13.179
See this?
It's been chewed. Aaagh!

02:14.140 --> 02:17.739
What Debbie wants or needs,
don't ask me.

02:17.740 --> 02:21.739
Never been able to work that one out.

KEY TURNS IN LOCK

02:28.260 --> 02:29.259
Who the fuck are you?

02:29.260 --> 02:31.419
Estate agent!

02:31.420 --> 02:32.179
I'm dealing with the situation.

02:32.180 --> 02:34.779
An Englishman's home is his castle.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.499
As I've said, Mrs Jackson
has instructed us to sell -

02:37.500 --> 02:39.139
any problems, ring her.

02:39.140 --> 02:42.499
Go on, bugger off,
you arse-faced little twat.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.139
Out on me arse.

02:45.140 --> 02:46.939
(CLICK) Just like that.

02:46.940 --> 02:50.939
It wasn't me that walked out.
I did everything I could to
make the relationship work.

02:51.420 --> 02:54.059
But it means you're
back for good, right, Dad?

02:54.060 --> 02:58.059
Where's the fuckin' justice, hey?
If I'd have been her,
she'd have had me for the lot.

02:59.140 --> 03:00.819
Except you don't own any property.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.499
Exactly, Philip.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.179
That's how much society values
fathers. It's enough to make you

03:06.180 --> 03:09.099
put on tights and join them
pillocks dressed up as Batman.

03:09.100 --> 03:13.059
I am going to the fucking wall
on this one, I tell you.

03:13.060 --> 03:17.059
Property is theft. Never realised
the truth of that until today.

03:17.380 --> 03:21.379
Still, you're back in your rightful
place, that's the main thing, chick.

03:25.980 --> 03:29.979
Carl, get off my geography project!

03:30.620 --> 03:32.459
What is the point of you?

03:32.460 --> 03:36.459
I didn't see it, did I?

03:44.780 --> 03:46.459
Extra strength.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.379
(GROANS AND COUGHS)

03:49.380 --> 03:51.859
Thanks, darling.

03:51.860 --> 03:55.699
When you moved in with Sheila,
I missed bringing you your tea.

03:55.700 --> 03:59.699
But then I got used to it.
Don't tell Mum, but I've been
saving for a geography field trip.

04:00.980 --> 04:04.699
Four nights at the wetlands
Centre in Walton-on-the-Naze.

04:04.700 --> 04:08.699
Anyway, I haven't got enough saved,
so you might as well have some.

04:16.060 --> 04:19.379
Thanks, kid.

04:19.380 --> 04:23.379
I can sub you. Till you get
Sheila's house money back
through the courts and that.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.499
It's not really about the money, is
it? It's more wanting to see justice.

04:30.660 --> 04:32.739
Families need fathers, don't they?

04:32.740 --> 04:34.099
Oh!

04:34.100 --> 04:37.419
Wondered where you'd got to.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.339
I just needed a bit of down time.

04:39.340 --> 04:42.019
That moving, it takes it out of you.

04:42.020 --> 04:45.379
Oh, Frank...

04:45.380 --> 04:49.379
Plenty of TLC, that's what you need.

No, Nelson.
Get to your bed.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.499
Sorry, I thought it were business.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.939
Business?

05:29.940 --> 05:32.059
You know, drugs.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.259
Not cos of... I mean, cos of him.

05:35.780 --> 05:39.779
He was attack trained, started off
as a police dog till they realised
he didn't have the temperament.

05:41.940 --> 05:45.299
But you're a red rag to a fuckin'
bull, looking at him like that.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.739
I didn't look at him,
he came out of nowhere.

You've been going through it

I'd have taught you a few manners.

06:37.460 --> 06:40.219
Oh, yeah?
Put me over your knee, would you?

06:40.220 --> 06:42.219
For starters.

06:42.220 --> 06:44.859
Excuse me, Mrs Maguire.

06:44.860 --> 06:48.859
Mrs Maguire? In your dreams!

06:52.100 --> 06:53.139
Got any gear?

06:53.140 --> 06:56.739
Oh, shit.

06:56.740 --> 06:59.059
You're, erm,

06:59.060 --> 07:01.379
you're...the dealer.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.139
I'm not a dealer, all right?

07:03.140 --> 07:05.739
Right, I thought
you were the other one.

07:05.740 --> 07:08.459
Er, ones.

07:08.460 --> 07:11.099
I can get you some Es
from behind the bar.

07:11.100 --> 07:15.099
No, you're all right.

07:16.540 --> 07:18.539
Would d'you think of that then?

07:18.540 --> 07:20.779
Fuckin' hell, how d'you get that?

07:20.780 --> 07:24.779
Bottle. This psycho went for Nelson
in a pub while we was off down south.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.779
Had a thing for dogs, you know.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.779
Touch it, if you want.

07:29.780 --> 07:33.779
Feels well smooth.

07:33.940 --> 07:37.619
Well go on, it won't fuckin' bite!

07:37.620 --> 07:39.259
Yeah.

07:39.260 --> 07:42.739
Doesn't hurt.

07:42.740 --> 07:44.859
14 stitches, I had.

07:44.860 --> 07:48.859
Doctor said I'm lucky to be alive.

07:49.220 --> 07:53.219
I think we'd better go and, er...

07:53.300 --> 07:54.579
You what?

07:54.580 --> 07:56.059
You know, if anyone comes in.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.499
Fuck off!

07:58.500 --> 08:01.739
You fuckin' little pervert!
Do I look like a fuckin' poofter?

08:01.740 --> 08:05.739
No. Honest, you don't.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.859
But you do have an 'ard-on.

08:30.820 --> 08:32.299
I'll see to all these, then, shall I?

08:32.299 --> 08:35.659
I'll see to all these, then, shall I?
Not my turn.

08:35.659 --> 08:39.379
Sometimes I wonder why I married you.

08:39.380 --> 08:43.099
I suppose I should be grateful
the wife's not letting herself go.

08:43.100 --> 08:47.099
knew when you put the
ring on my finger,
I'd have to keep up my standards.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.899
Plenty of girls would be
happy to be Mrs Jamie McGuire.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.219
Damn right.

08:51.220 --> 08:53.819
Of course, your mum
is giving it six weeks.

08:53.820 --> 08:57.459
My mum's just jealous cos she can see
I've married the woman of my dreams.

08:57.460 --> 08:59.499
Nightmare, more like.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.859
Karen...

09:01.860 --> 09:03.459
So, how many kids do you want?

09:03.460 --> 09:04.699
Hundreds.

09:04.700 --> 09:08.699
You have 'em, then.

09:09.340 --> 09:13.339
LAUGHTER

09:13.540 --> 09:16.099
I was thinking that...

09:16.100 --> 09:20.099
Morning.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.059
It's not normal.

09:23.060 --> 09:24.579
He's my dad.Exactly.

09:24.580 --> 09:26.939
It's high time you got
yourself a boyfriend.

09:26.940 --> 09:28.139
Even Spaccy Wright's
not that desperate.

09:28.140 --> 09:30.179
Oh, piss off, Carl.

09:30.180 --> 09:31.979
Deb's not interested in lads.

09:31.980 --> 09:33.699
Course I am.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.859
# Debbie likes boys!
Debbie likes boys! #

09:35.860 --> 09:39.539
Leave her alone, you lot. She's just
a late developer, aren't you, Deb?

09:39.540 --> 09:41.499
No!Exactly,

09:41.500 --> 09:44.619
that's what I'm saying,
it's you got yourself laid, madam.

09:44.620 --> 09:46.099
Mum!

09:46.100 --> 09:48.779
Well, it's not natural,
a girl hanging round home

09:48.780 --> 09:51.939
all the time, unless, of course,
you're the other way?

09:51.940 --> 09:55.939
You mean, like you used to be?
Before you decided to use
my dad as a meal ticket.

09:56.420 --> 10:00.419
Hey!

10:06.300 --> 10:08.099
Need a bog roll.

10:08.100 --> 10:12.099
Dad, she's saying that
I shouldn't be hanging around you.
You don't think I'm weird, do you?

10:13.020 --> 10:14.299
Of course not.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.619
Well, not weird, no, just...

10:16.620 --> 10:18.939
Just, like, special.

10:18.940 --> 10:21.259
Always has been.
Lickle Debbie.

10:21.260 --> 10:25.259
But she's not little any more,
that's the point. Look at her.
At her age, I was running a house.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.859
I am running the house.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.939
No, with your dad.

10:29.940 --> 10:33.939
You need to get yourself a fella,
Debbie. Tell her, Frank.

10:34.660 --> 10:38.659
You know, just,
what your mum says, she's your mum.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.499
OK, then.
If that's what you want...

10:55.500 --> 10:56.499
Debs!

10:59.300 --> 11:03.299
Normal, ribbed,
extra-strong, or flavoured?

11:04.020 --> 11:05.299
What flavours have you got?

11:05.300 --> 11:07.459
Hm.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.379
Fruit cocktail, banoffee pie,

11:09.380 --> 11:11.699
chicken balti.
I wouldn't bother with that one.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.219
Just normal then.

11:13.220 --> 11:16.019
5.62, love.

11:16.020 --> 11:18.379
I haven't seen you with a lad,
Debbie, love.

11:18.380 --> 11:19.499
It's not that Wright boy, is it?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.779
Spacky Wright!

11:21.780 --> 11:23.379
In't, is it?
Is it?!

11:23.380 --> 11:26.579
No!
It's just a lad.

11:26.580 --> 11:30.579
I think we've upset her.

11:31.180 --> 11:35.179
You all right?

11:44.860 --> 11:46.579
Hey, up!

11:46.580 --> 11:49.259
ALL: Whaay!

11:49.260 --> 11:53.219
Here you are, Spider,
I think she fancies yer!

11:53.220 --> 11:55.139
Hey. You got a girlfriend?

11:55.140 --> 11:59.139
No.

12:00.340 --> 12:03.179
We split up!

12:03.180 --> 12:07.179
Ideally, I think intercourse should
happen in the context of a loving
relationship.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.099
You what?

12:08.100 --> 12:10.139
You what?
You shouldn't shag someone
if you don't like 'em.

12:10.140 --> 12:14.139
How do you get laid then?

12:18.700 --> 12:21.299
It's my turn to bring those in.

12:21.300 --> 12:25.299
Team work. That's what
married life's all about, isn't it?

12:26.100 --> 12:28.779
Is it? I thought it was about having
someone to blamewhen your life
turns out to be shit.

12:28.780 --> 12:31.459
Yeah, well, that, too.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.739
Talking of which...

12:33.740 --> 12:36.699
I realised we'd been putting
the cart before the horse.

12:36.700 --> 12:40.699
Time to make an
honest woman out of you.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.459
Karen, I'm sorry, OK!
What have I done?!

12:46.460 --> 12:48.659
It's a big fucking joke, in't it?

12:48.660 --> 12:50.579
Karen the bike!
Karen the big laugh!

12:50.580 --> 12:53.179
Who would want to marry her?!
She's good for a jump

12:53.180 --> 12:55.739
or a blow job, but that's it!
Well, I'm not laughing, all right?!

12:55.740 --> 12:56.779
I'm not joking!

12:56.780 --> 12:59.539
I wouldn't marry you...

12:59.540 --> 13:00.179
What?!

13:00.180 --> 13:04.179
What?!
It's not a joke.
Will you fucking marry me?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.979
Why?

13:12.980 --> 13:13.899
What d'you mean, why?

13:13.900 --> 13:17.459
You don't even know me, Jamie.

13:17.460 --> 13:20.179
Yeah, I do!
I see you every day.

13:20.180 --> 13:22.979
You're the only one,
when I came out of prison,

13:22.980 --> 13:24.779
didn't treat me like a fucking
psycho!

13:24.780 --> 13:28.779
You must realise I
fancy the arse off you.

13:28.860 --> 13:31.019
Yeah...

13:31.020 --> 13:33.659
But getting married...

13:33.660 --> 13:37.659
We could try like
going on a date first...

13:37.820 --> 13:41.819
Fuck all that.
I've lost 10 years of my life.

13:42.140 --> 13:44.299
I know what I want
from the rest of it.

13:44.300 --> 13:48.299
You.

14:03.940 --> 14:07.939
You all right in there, love?

14:09.660 --> 14:13.659
It's not your old trouble, is it?
When did you last go?

14:26.460 --> 14:29.859
Hey! You shouldn't be
chucking stuff in there.

14:29.860 --> 14:33.859
Especially if it's
not biodegradable.

14:34.460 --> 14:35.939
What was it, a crisp packet?

14:35.940 --> 14:39.939
No. What are you anyway?
The litter police?

14:40.140 --> 14:41.939
Just care about the environment.

14:41.940 --> 14:43.299
Well, good for you.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.459
At my old school,we did this
project clearing out that canal.

14:46.460 --> 14:48.619
It's totally minging, some
of the stuff we got out.

14:48.620 --> 14:51.139
I took all the old trollies
back to the supermarket -

14:51.140 --> 14:54.139
made nearly 20 quid. Some of them
didn't even have wheels.

14:54.140 --> 14:55.979
Free money, or what?

14:55.980 --> 14:59.819
You fancy me?

14:59.820 --> 15:00.859
Yeah.

15:00.860 --> 15:03.459
Do you want to go out later then?

15:03.460 --> 15:07.459
We could take some stuff
down to the recycling centre.
After tea, half nine.

15:07.620 --> 15:11.619
All right.

15:14.060 --> 15:17.139
It's not for you, it's for the baby!

15:17.140 --> 15:18.419
What fucking baby?!

15:18.420 --> 15:22.419
Everyone knows, Jez, love. There's
no shame in going with a fella
now and again.

15:23.020 --> 15:25.699
Even if you are on the other bus.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.619
It's a surrogate pregnancy, Lillian!

15:27.620 --> 15:30.699
And the only thing that touched
me was a fucking turkey baster!

15:30.700 --> 15:33.219
And that baby will be out of me and
down to Swindon

15:33.220 --> 15:36.099
before the four grand has a chance to
hit me bank account!

15:36.100 --> 15:39.899
So no knitwear, ta very much.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.499
You know,

15:41.500 --> 15:45.499
I thought that gauge was
loose on them needles.

15:54.340 --> 15:56.139
People are gonna start talking.

15:56.140 --> 16:00.139
Fuck off, I'm off home, aren't I?

16:04.500 --> 16:08.499
Fuck off!

16:14.620 --> 16:17.179
There's no-one in.

16:17.180 --> 16:21.179
Me mum and dad are at
their Irish dancing lesson.

16:28.620 --> 16:32.619
'Ready, fellas? OK.'

16:43.980 --> 16:47.099
# Like a cat in heat
Stuck in a moving car

16:47.100 --> 16:50.059
# A scary conversation shut my eyes
Can't find the brake

16:50.060 --> 16:53.419
# What if they say you're a quitter?

16:53.420 --> 16:57.139
# Oh, oh

16:57.140 --> 16:58.619
# What you waiting
What you waiting

16:58.620 --> 17:00.419
#What you waiting
What you waiting

17:00.420 --> 17:03.299
# What you waiting for?

17:03.300 --> 17:07.299
# Nice day for a white wedding

17:09.260 --> 17:13.259
# Well, it's a nice day to...
start again! #

17:17.300 --> 17:21.299
Sweet.

17:24.220 --> 17:27.459
Fucking hell.

17:27.460 --> 17:28.699
What is it?

17:28.700 --> 17:31.339
Haven't even cut it yet.
Stuff we sell round here

17:31.340 --> 17:32.659
is mostly baby formula.

17:32.660 --> 17:36.059
Little Katie's probably getting
more of a buzz than the punters.

17:36.060 --> 17:39.019
Haven't seen that new
disabled sticker, have you?

17:39.020 --> 17:42.219
Those bastard traffic wardens
down the community centre.

17:42.220 --> 17:43.859
There's no messing with them.

17:43.860 --> 17:46.899
I don't want your mother
doing another stretch for GBH.

17:46.900 --> 17:47.419
It's not...

17:47.420 --> 17:50.859
That Panamanian gear? Makes
you sweat like a fucking pig, eh?

17:50.860 --> 17:51.939
Yeah!
I...I...

17:51.940 --> 17:55.939
Yeah, well, don't get a taste for
it, you couldn't afford it. Ha-ha!

17:58.100 --> 18:02.099
Look at you,
like a pair of fucking queers there!

18:03.980 --> 18:07.979
Fuck!

18:10.540 --> 18:12.419
DOOR CLOSES

18:12.420 --> 18:15.379
Shit!

18:15.380 --> 18:17.899
Haven't had a close call
like that since me mam

18:17.900 --> 18:21.899
nearly walked in
on Nelson sucking us off.

18:24.780 --> 18:25.379
Nelson?

18:25.380 --> 18:28.379
Yeah.
I was about 13, right.

18:28.380 --> 18:31.339
Dad broke both my arms
for dealing on his patch.

18:31.340 --> 18:33.859
I was plaster up
to here going mad for a wank!

18:33.860 --> 18:36.779
I mean, how horny are
you when you're 13, hey?

18:36.780 --> 18:40.779
Talk about a man's best friend!

18:44.180 --> 18:48.179
Excuse me!

18:58.340 --> 19:00.779
Debbie.
Turkey dinosaurs.

19:00.780 --> 19:03.779
I'm off out.
Got a date.

19:03.780 --> 19:05.459
Fuck off, who with?

19:05.460 --> 19:07.339
Luke.

19:07.340 --> 19:10.059
You know.

19:10.060 --> 19:11.099
Forget it.

19:11.100 --> 19:14.939
Anyway, I've got my key, might not be
home till late. Or I might stay out.

19:14.940 --> 19:15.859
You shagging him?

19:15.860 --> 19:16.579
Probably.

19:16.580 --> 19:17.739
Debbie!

19:17.740 --> 19:20.379
What?! You were all
having a go at me before!

19:20.380 --> 19:22.179
Why shouldn't I have a sex
life like everyone else?!

19:22.180 --> 19:23.979
It's just that, well...

19:23.980 --> 19:27.979
have a word, Mum.

19:29.220 --> 19:31.819
Right, well you could
always go on the pill.

19:31.820 --> 19:34.459
Although if you're like me
it'll make you retain more

19:34.460 --> 19:38.179
water than Galton reservoir. But
if you're serious about this lad,

19:38.180 --> 19:42.179
maybe you should put your name
down early for a council flat.

19:44.020 --> 19:48.019
Talk to her.
Debbie!

19:54.020 --> 19:58.019
Go on.

19:59.620 --> 20:00.659
Debbie.

20:00.660 --> 20:04.659
When a man and a woman...

20:05.140 --> 20:09.059
come together.

20:09.060 --> 20:12.499
The union of two beings...

20:12.500 --> 20:16.379
Dad, it's no big deal. One, I'm going
to use a condom. I mean,

20:16.380 --> 20:19.699
there's chlamydia to think of,
apart from the contraceptive issues.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.179
And, two,
with all the gymnastics I've done

20:22.180 --> 20:26.179
I'll probably have no hymen left.

20:29.020 --> 20:33.019
I fried the beans in the bacon fat,
Karen. That's the secret.

20:33.420 --> 20:36.899
It's delicious. Have to show me how.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.819
DOG SLURPS

20:38.820 --> 20:42.139
Mum, do we have to have
Nelson licking round everywhere?

20:42.140 --> 20:42.659
It's not exactly hygienic.

20:42.660 --> 20:43.899
Don't start!

20:43.900 --> 20:45.779
Don't talk to me
about fucking Nelson!

20:45.780 --> 20:46.499
DOG WHIMPERS

20:46.500 --> 20:50.099
D'you like dogs, Karen?

20:50.100 --> 20:51.379
Yeah.

20:51.380 --> 20:55.379
Wait till the baby's born before
you get one. You never know how
they'll be with a little one.

20:56.780 --> 21:00.059
Christ, no! Do you remember taking
Shane down for all them stitches?

21:00.060 --> 21:04.059
Poor wee bastard.
Reconstructive surgery, my arse!

21:04.100 --> 21:06.499
Fuck off!

21:06.500 --> 21:07.899
Baby?

21:07.900 --> 21:11.899
Karen's not pregnant, Mam.

21:15.060 --> 21:19.059
We thought we'd try
getting married first.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.259
Well...

21:22.260 --> 21:26.259
there's a first time
for everything...

21:32.780 --> 21:36.779
He fancies the dog.

21:38.140 --> 21:40.059
That went well.

21:40.060 --> 21:43.499
No, they really like you.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.019
Jamie,
she nearly broke me fucking arm.

21:46.020 --> 21:50.019
SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT

21:51.100 --> 21:52.299
CHEERING

21:52.300 --> 21:55.179
It's just her way of
welcoming you into the family.

21:55.180 --> 21:58.179
Seriously, you were a big hit.

21:58.180 --> 21:58.699
Ow...

21:58.700 --> 22:02.659
Oh, sorry.

22:02.660 --> 22:03.179
Better?

22:03.180 --> 22:07.179
No.

22:16.020 --> 22:18.739
D'you think it's a bit weird,
us getting engaged?

22:18.740 --> 22:20.339
No. Look, I know my family's

22:20.340 --> 22:23.619
not exactly Little House On
The fucking Prairie, Karen,

22:23.620 --> 22:24.699
but I'm my own man.

22:24.700 --> 22:28.059
I don't mean your family.

22:28.060 --> 22:30.819
I mean us not having...

22:30.820 --> 22:33.299
you know, done it.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.059
What is it?

22:35.060 --> 22:37.339
Is it me, being experienced?

22:37.340 --> 22:39.139
No.

22:39.140 --> 22:42.379
I was inside for 10 years.

22:42.380 --> 22:44.019
Oh, that?

22:44.020 --> 22:45.659
I don't mind whose bitch you were.

22:45.660 --> 22:47.259
No, I wasn't!

22:47.260 --> 22:48.899
Dad warned them off.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.539
But apart from copping the odd feel
from this art therapist

22:52.540 --> 22:55.019
who used to visit a few years back.

22:55.020 --> 22:58.139
I mean, you do the maths.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.939
You're a virgin?

23:00.940 --> 23:04.939
I might as well be.

23:18.100 --> 23:22.099
I don't think it's
going to be a problem.

23:24.300 --> 23:27.419
What's this? The fucking honeymoon?

23:27.420 --> 23:29.299
Oh, bastard heartburn again.

23:29.300 --> 23:32.499
There's an all-night chemist
down Birchington Lane.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.739
Well, I can't go in
my condition, can I?!

23:34.740 --> 23:38.499
I need 12 hours sleep
or I'm fit for nowt.

23:38.500 --> 23:42.139
Don't wait up then.

23:42.140 --> 23:46.139
(BURPS)

24:01.980 --> 24:05.179
You're late!

24:05.180 --> 24:09.179
Only two minutes. Well, one minute
40 seconds, if you're counting.

24:13.260 --> 24:16.899
Nice.

24:16.900 --> 24:20.899
So,
what was you thinking we'd do then?

24:28.140 --> 24:30.259
It's all right.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.779
I want to.

24:31.780 --> 24:33.419
What's up?

24:33.420 --> 24:34.779
Are you gay?

24:34.780 --> 24:36.819
No.

24:36.820 --> 24:38.139
It's not, it's not that.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.419
I thought you fancied me?

24:39.420 --> 24:41.819
I do.

24:41.820 --> 24:44.979
I've brought my own.

24:44.980 --> 24:48.499
What is it? What is it, Luke?

24:48.500 --> 24:50.499
There's something you
need to know about me.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.339
Oh, no! Get lost, leave me alone!

24:53.340 --> 24:55.779
Debbie!
Debbie, come back, will you?!

24:55.780 --> 24:59.779
Debbie!

25:02.500 --> 25:06.499
Debbie!

25:33.260 --> 25:37.259
Morning.Hiya.

25:38.380 --> 25:40.259
What are you doing up so early?

25:40.260 --> 25:44.259
You know.

25:44.460 --> 25:48.459
Haven't been back since last night.

25:48.620 --> 25:52.619
Luke.

25:52.820 --> 25:56.819
I've been having sex with Luke.

25:57.380 --> 25:59.939
What were it like?

25:59.940 --> 26:01.899
Yeah, great. It was great.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.619
Yeah, great. It was great.
Was it?

26:03.620 --> 26:06.499
How many times?

26:06.500 --> 26:10.499
About five or six.

26:19.220 --> 26:23.219
Morning!

26:30.980 --> 26:34.979
Don't fucking do that!
Sorry.

26:38.340 --> 26:40.899
It's a bit risky here, Mickey.
You know.

26:40.900 --> 26:44.619
Oh, OK.

26:44.620 --> 26:47.019
Came to bring you this.

26:47.020 --> 26:49.419
An iPod? Didn't buy it, did you?

26:49.420 --> 26:53.059
Yeah, from our Shane.
He knocked a lorry off last Thursday.

26:53.060 --> 26:57.059
Oh, cheers.

27:01.380 --> 27:02.379
Maybe see you after work, then?

27:02.380 --> 27:06.379
Yeah, maybe.

27:09.180 --> 27:13.179
Fuck off, eh?

27:35.420 --> 27:38.859
# Sunrise, sunset

27:38.860 --> 27:42.259
# Sunrise, sunset

27:42.260 --> 27:45.899
# Swiftly flow the days

27:45.900 --> 27:49.899
# Seedlings turn overnight
to sunflowers... #

27:51.020 --> 27:51.979
It is normal, Frank.

27:51.980 --> 27:52.979
It is normal, Frank.
What is?

27:52.980 --> 27:56.179
Debbie getting laid.
Well, it is.

27:56.180 --> 27:57.699
Who's the lad? Do you know?

27:57.700 --> 27:59.699
Who's the lad? Do you know?
Luke something-or-other.

27:59.700 --> 28:00.979
Moved in across there.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.459
The coloured family?

28:02.460 --> 28:04.259
You can't say "coloured" nowadays.

28:04.260 --> 28:06.179
Well, what are you
supposed to call them then?

28:06.180 --> 28:07.899
Well, what are you
supposed to call them then?
"Them"?

28:07.900 --> 28:09.579
Afro-Caribbean.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.619
Give over. Who says that? >

28:11.620 --> 28:15.619
Anyway, I know that lot from when
I lived over on the Wilby.

28:16.700 --> 28:20.699
The Newmans. I'd be surprised if
Debbie's carrying on with their son.

28:21.620 --> 28:22.619
Why's that, then?

28:22.620 --> 28:25.179
Why's that, then?
They're religious!

28:25.180 --> 28:28.339
Twelfth-Day Reformed
Pentecostalists.

28:28.340 --> 28:31.979
I dabbled a bit myself a while
back, but it wasn't for me.

28:31.980 --> 28:35.299
Oh, not the fucking God squad!

28:35.300 --> 28:39.299
50% of your income to the church.

28:40.020 --> 28:41.059
Thank you.

28:41.060 --> 28:42.979
Thank you.
Strictly no sex before marriage.

28:42.980 --> 28:45.339
So if Debbie's set her cap
at young what's-his-face,

28:45.340 --> 28:48.859
they'll be down the aisle
before you can say Jack Robinson.

28:48.860 --> 28:51.019
50 fucking per cent!

28:51.020 --> 28:53.539
Worse than the fucking Catholics!

28:53.540 --> 28:55.219
Worse than the fucking Christians!

28:55.220 --> 28:56.299
Catholics are Christians.

28:56.300 --> 28:59.219
Oh, fuck off.
A pound of fucking flesh!

28:59.220 --> 29:02.699
Frank, Debbie likes this lad.
What good are you going to do?

29:02.700 --> 29:04.179
She's got a point.

29:04.180 --> 29:05.899
Excuse me! This is my daughter!

29:05.900 --> 29:08.419
Every father's worst
fucking nightmare!

29:08.420 --> 29:12.419
"Dad, meet my boyfriend,
the Reverend Fucking Chisel-Arse!"

29:16.340 --> 29:20.339
Dad!

29:25.340 --> 29:29.339
Hey, pointy-tits.
Fancy a shag or what?

29:29.580 --> 29:30.739
Yeah.

29:30.740 --> 29:32.339
I said yeah!

29:32.340 --> 29:34.219
Nah, sorry.

29:34.220 --> 29:38.219
Don't do donations to charity.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.019
Tonight?

29:40.020 --> 29:44.019
I know it's a bit soon, but
I thought it'd be nice for you
to meet some of the extended family.

29:45.140 --> 29:49.139
And if your future mother-in-law
can't give you a hen do, who can?

29:50.140 --> 29:53.259
Course,
it might not be your cup of tea.

29:53.260 --> 29:54.419
No, it's just...

29:54.420 --> 29:58.419
It's just I know our
Jamie's keen for us to get on.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.739
Yeah. I'd love to.

30:01.740 --> 30:03.299
It's really nice of you, Mimi.

30:03.300 --> 30:06.539
I've just had an arrangement.

30:06.540 --> 30:09.739
Which I'll rearrange, obviously.

30:09.740 --> 30:13.219
You see, Karen, love,
it's true what they say.

30:13.220 --> 30:16.179
A son's a son till he gets a wife.

30:16.180 --> 30:20.179
A daughter-in-law's yours
for all of her life.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.859
Still on to fuck your
brains out tonight?

30:24.860 --> 30:26.939
Your mum's just asked me out,
as it happens.

30:26.940 --> 30:28.859
Not an all-nighter, is it?

30:28.860 --> 30:30.019
Not an all-nighter, is it?
Hope not.

30:30.020 --> 30:31.979
Christ, me too.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.699
You see, I told you she liked you.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.779
You're just paranoid.

30:37.780 --> 30:39.619
'So, Mr Gallagher,'

30:39.620 --> 30:42.099
you're concerned about my son
at seeing your daughter?

30:42.100 --> 30:44.819
Is this true? That you've been...

30:44.820 --> 30:46.419
courting this girl?

30:46.420 --> 30:47.579
No, not courting, just...

30:47.580 --> 30:50.739
Can I speak? Please?

30:50.740 --> 30:54.139
My concern...

30:54.140 --> 30:58.139
if I can put it this way, is...

30:58.340 --> 31:01.619
lifestyle.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.499
Lifestyle?

31:03.500 --> 31:07.059
Debbie's lifestyle.

31:07.060 --> 31:10.499
She's...

31:10.500 --> 31:12.979
well, let me put it like this.

31:12.980 --> 31:16.979
I wouldn't be that keen on any son
of mine hanging around with her.

31:17.340 --> 31:20.419
I'm not sure
I catch your drift, Mr Gallagher.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.019
She's...

31:22.020 --> 31:26.019
it's a terrible thing to have
to say about your own daughter.

31:27.380 --> 31:30.499
But, to be honest,

31:30.500 --> 31:32.339
she likes to...

31:32.340 --> 31:36.339
to...

31:37.180 --> 31:40.179
Samson and Delilah?
Jason and the Argonauts?

31:40.180 --> 31:42.459
Sodom. Jezebel.

31:42.460 --> 31:44.299
Yeah.

31:44.300 --> 31:48.299
She is a Jezebel through
and through. Isn't she, Philip?

31:49.580 --> 31:51.579
Umm...

31:51.580 --> 31:55.579
I mean, I'd have him
checked out if I was you.

32:04.980 --> 32:07.019
Should have listened, shouldn't you?

32:07.020 --> 32:10.179
"Jezebel through and through!"
Nice one, Dad.

32:10.180 --> 32:12.179
Well, it worked, didn't it?

32:12.180 --> 32:15.219
I wouldn't touch her with a
fucking barge-pole from now on.

32:15.220 --> 32:19.059
Or 50% of a fucking barge-pole.

32:19.060 --> 32:21.579
Oh, Lip...

32:21.580 --> 32:22.979
The state of you!

32:22.980 --> 32:25.579
I still feel a bit sick, actually.

32:25.580 --> 32:28.099
What are you doing going on the lash?

32:28.100 --> 32:30.179
You're supposed to be at school.

32:30.180 --> 32:31.779
Spider and his mates seen me.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.019
Spider?

32:33.020 --> 32:36.019
You don't think that's
his real name, do you?

32:36.020 --> 32:38.699
I don't think I can go
to school ever again?

32:38.700 --> 32:41.219
Why not? What's been going on
with you and this Spider lad?

32:41.220 --> 32:43.219
Nothing.

32:43.220 --> 32:46.339
That's what's been going on.
Absolutely nothing.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.019
I don't get it, Debs.

32:48.020 --> 32:50.899
I thought all you were into
was Luke, five minutes back.

32:50.900 --> 32:54.739
Luke's lovely. But he wouldn't
do it with me, either.

32:54.740 --> 32:58.059
God says it's wrong.
No-one wants me, Lip.

32:58.060 --> 32:59.779
You mean you haven't shagged him?

32:59.780 --> 33:03.779
I told you, he wouldn't. He said
God might see us and smite us down.

33:05.060 --> 33:07.139
And I tried to do it with Spider

33:07.140 --> 33:09.539
so you and Mum and everyone
couldn't get at me any more.

33:09.540 --> 33:13.539
He just laughed at me.
It was horrible.

33:14.500 --> 33:18.499
(SHE MOANS)

33:19.020 --> 33:23.019
KNOCK ON DOOR

33:23.420 --> 33:25.739
Just live and learn, Deb.

33:25.740 --> 33:29.739
This whole business is 90%
fiction and 10% friction.

33:33.500 --> 33:37.499
Hello, Mr Gallagher.
I wanted to see Debbie.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.579
Hiya.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.219
Hiya.

33:43.220 --> 33:46.659
I just wanted to say, you know,

33:46.660 --> 33:48.659
I understand.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.339
About you being a bit of a slag.

33:51.340 --> 33:55.339
Probably just low
self-esteem and that.

34:11.659 --> 34:13.699
Hiya!

34:13.699 --> 34:15.539
I missed you. Did you miss me?

34:15.540 --> 34:17.859
I missed you. Did you miss me?
What are they?

34:17.860 --> 34:21.859
I got 'em from the travel agent.
Thought we might get away together.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.739
Mykonos, I-bizza...

34:24.739 --> 34:26.018
Are you fucking mental?

34:26.020 --> 34:27.059
Are you fucking mental?
We could go off-season.

34:27.060 --> 34:31.059
I'm not going on holiday with you.

34:31.659 --> 34:34.219
I don't...want to...

34:34.219 --> 34:38.219
you know...go out with you.

34:38.420 --> 34:41.179
Is it cos of what
I told you about Nelson?

34:41.179 --> 34:43.579
No...

34:43.580 --> 34:46.379
it's just...

34:46.380 --> 34:48.379
look.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.938
It were good.

34:49.940 --> 34:53.938
But it's not going to carry on.
I mean, you, me?

34:53.980 --> 34:57.979
We'd be dead meat if anyone
finds out. You know we would.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.059
But I love you.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.699
Oh, fucking hell... No, you don't.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.579
I do. All these fucking feelings!

35:07.580 --> 35:09.699
You're the only one who understands.

35:09.700 --> 35:11.739
I don't. Honest. I don't.

35:11.740 --> 35:15.739
I fucking love you.

35:18.020 --> 35:22.019
And if it takes telling my mam
and dad about us, how I feel,

35:22.220 --> 35:24.059
that's what I'm going to do.

35:24.060 --> 35:24.819
What d'you mean?

35:24.820 --> 35:26.579
I'm going to tell them how I feel!

35:26.580 --> 35:28.939
Mickey!

35:28.940 --> 35:31.779
Mam, Dad, I've got
something to tell you.

35:31.780 --> 35:34.939
And it's not something I'm
ashamed of. In fact, I'm proud.

35:34.940 --> 35:38.939
He taught Nelson to suck his cock!

35:41.300 --> 35:41.979
(KNOCKS)

35:41.980 --> 35:44.579
All right?

35:44.580 --> 35:46.939
See you later.'ey?

35:46.940 --> 35:50.259
Hen do.Hen do?

35:50.260 --> 35:54.259
WHIMPERING

35:55.260 --> 35:59.259
Mimi?

36:01.820 --> 36:05.299
Calm down, Mickey. I'll have Nelson
here until it all blows over, right?

36:05.300 --> 36:06.579
Er, bad choice of words.

36:06.580 --> 36:08.899
Fuck off, you fuckin' nobhead!

36:08.900 --> 36:12.899
I said, enough! Unless you want
me to take him back next door!

36:13.620 --> 36:15.899
Me dad says he's gonna
have Nelson put down!

36:15.900 --> 36:19.899
You know what he means
to me, you fucking cunt.

36:22.660 --> 36:26.659
I fucking hate yer!

36:30.260 --> 36:31.699
What was all that about?

36:31.700 --> 36:35.699
Don't ask.

36:37.140 --> 36:41.139
Wind changes,
you'll stay like that.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.619
Right, this is the plan.

36:46.620 --> 36:48.899
One bloke doing the rounds.

36:48.900 --> 36:52.899
Back's forcible, a few Yales,
that's it. Marlene'll drive down...

36:53.660 --> 36:56.859
Hang on. Is this...?
We're not going on a raid, are we?

36:56.860 --> 36:59.419
Bit of business and
pleasure, Karen love.

36:59.420 --> 37:01.659
A few gross of
digital foot massagers.

37:01.660 --> 37:05.659
Right, me and Marlene are in,
while sugar tits here gets it on

37:05.820 --> 37:07.499
with the security bastard.

37:07.500 --> 37:10.659
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.
In and out, 20 tops.

37:10.660 --> 37:13.299
Are you saying you want me to
cop off with the guard?

37:13.300 --> 37:15.619
Nothing you haven't done before.

37:15.620 --> 37:19.619
No... Why does it have to be me?

37:25.020 --> 37:27.459
I'm engaged, Mimi, to your son.

37:27.460 --> 37:30.379
It'll be our little
secret, Karen love.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.899
Men can be a bit funny
about that sort of thing.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.859
Right, ladies, let's go.

37:34.860 --> 37:37.979
8 o'clock shift change.

37:37.980 --> 37:41.979
Take us four hours to get
out of the fucking van.

37:43.900 --> 37:47.899
Right, are we ready?

37:49.260 --> 37:51.859
No calls till the job's done.

37:51.860 --> 37:55.859
Cops can trace records. Go on.

38:08.300 --> 38:09.499
Debbie.

38:09.500 --> 38:13.059
You know, if a lad really likes you,
he won't care what anyone says.

38:13.060 --> 38:14.219
What, if I'm a slapper you mean?

38:14.220 --> 38:18.219
What, if I'm a slapper you mean?
No. Listen to me.
That's a bloke's word.

38:18.820 --> 38:22.339
It's a bloke's fucking hang up.
It doesn't matter what you do,

38:22.340 --> 38:24.619
or who you're doing it with, as
long as you're having a good time.

38:24.620 --> 38:26.659
I haven't done anything!

38:26.660 --> 38:29.099
Not that it's for lack of trying!

38:29.100 --> 38:31.139
There's no rush, Debs.

38:31.140 --> 38:32.779
It's always crap to start off.

38:32.780 --> 38:35.459
Thing to do is to get
a lad and train him up.

38:35.460 --> 38:37.259
This one that you like...

38:37.260 --> 38:39.099
Luke.

38:39.100 --> 38:41.219
He's religious, dead religious.

38:41.220 --> 38:43.259
His parents are, you mean?

38:43.260 --> 38:47.259
He's a 15-year-old lad. Choice
between you and Jesus, no contest.

38:49.300 --> 38:51.819
I mean, that beard's
minging for a start!

38:51.820 --> 38:53.779
And there's the sandals.

38:53.780 --> 38:55.779
Anyway, your hair's better.

38:55.780 --> 38:59.499
It's gonna take a bit more than
your dad and Lip going round

38:59.500 --> 39:01.339
and telling tales to his mum and
dad to put him off.

39:01.340 --> 39:02.619
Dad and Lip?

39:02.620 --> 39:05.459
Yeah, you know,
saying you're a loose woman.

39:05.460 --> 39:08.459
I thought it was Spider.

39:08.460 --> 39:12.459
Dad and Lip!

39:14.900 --> 39:15.939
Who are you?

39:15.940 --> 39:18.579
Pizza?

39:18.580 --> 39:22.579
Can't believe I actually forgot
the pizza. It's me first night.

39:24.860 --> 39:28.859
Yeah, but, like I said,
I han't ordered any pizza.

39:29.980 --> 39:33.979
Well that's all right then.
I might keep my job.

39:36.100 --> 39:38.499
So it's just you here
on your own, is it?

39:38.500 --> 39:42.499
Yeah. Nobby-no-mates.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.019
"Nobby"?

39:45.020 --> 39:49.019
Yeah, it's just a figure of speech.

39:49.580 --> 39:53.579
You and Nobby up for a bit of fun?

39:55.740 --> 39:57.779
All right, steady on.
Steady on, Deb.

39:57.780 --> 40:01.779
It's just one little... Sticks
and stones may hurt my bones,

40:02.500 --> 40:05.619
but I did it for all the right
reasons, to protect you.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.299
Protect me?!

40:07.300 --> 40:09.659
Flesh of my flesh.

40:09.660 --> 40:12.099
Protect young, born free, all that.

40:12.100 --> 40:16.099
They're not your standard
happy clappers, Deb. They take 50%.

40:17.900 --> 40:20.339
Half. Of your money.

40:20.340 --> 40:22.819
I haven't got any money!

40:22.820 --> 40:25.779
Yeah, but, it's the principle
of the thing, in't it?

40:25.780 --> 40:29.299
One of you better have some bloody
money to pay for these laxatives!

40:29.300 --> 40:33.219
You say it's to protect your young,
right? But you haven't, have you?

40:33.220 --> 40:36.059
Cos I really like Luke
and now he thinks I'm a slapper.

40:36.060 --> 40:40.059
You've been on their side saying
I should do it, when it turns out
you don't even care about that!

40:41.540 --> 40:45.259
You don't care about me! All you
care about is your bloody money!

40:45.260 --> 40:46.859
You're useless, you!

40:46.860 --> 40:50.859
Debbie! Debbie!
Debbie, please! Love!

40:51.980 --> 40:55.659
(PANTS) I'm...

40:55.660 --> 40:57.339
Fuck it, what can I do?

40:57.340 --> 41:00.259
I'll do anything.

41:00.260 --> 41:02.419
Come on, you name it!

41:02.420 --> 41:03.979
I'm begging you!

41:03.980 --> 41:07.019
I am a proud man
and I'm begging you.

41:07.020 --> 41:10.259
Money.

41:10.260 --> 41:21.739
I want 120 for the trip to
Walton-on-the-Naze and some
for spends. Then we can talk.

41:21.740 --> 41:25.739
(Fuck.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.899
(Oh, fuck.)

41:50.700 --> 41:54.659
Oh, oh.

41:54.660 --> 41:58.659
Oh. Oh.

42:06.100 --> 42:10.099
MOANING >

42:10.100 --> 42:14.099
Our Jamie's gonna fucking love this!

42:14.220 --> 42:18.219
Oh! Oh, fucking hell.

42:19.420 --> 42:20.459
Ah! >

42:20.460 --> 42:24.459
Ah! >
Smile for the camera, Karen!

42:26.260 --> 42:30.259
All right, Mimi?

42:33.940 --> 42:37.939
Hey, tell your friend
she can join in, in all.

42:44.060 --> 42:46.379
As you can see,
this is your living room.

42:46.380 --> 42:49.059
Kitchen, en suite.

42:49.060 --> 42:50.659
This is the bedroom.

42:50.660 --> 42:52.299
Bathroom.

42:52.300 --> 42:55.259
Oh, yes!

42:55.260 --> 42:59.259
The eagle has fucking landed!

43:17.860 --> 43:20.779
There's 200 quid.

43:20.780 --> 43:22.579
That do you?

43:22.580 --> 43:24.099
Pound of flesh.

43:24.100 --> 43:26.219
Where did you get it?

43:26.220 --> 43:29.339
Need to know, Deb.
Ways and means.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.339
240, 250. That is a one-off.
No more guest appearances.

43:34.580 --> 43:38.579
Gentlemen's agreement, Marlin.
Won't see hide nor hair from now on.

43:38.660 --> 43:42.659
They were going to make
a fucking offer, you know.

43:43.220 --> 43:47.139
Debbie, love.

43:47.140 --> 43:49.499
Everything all right?

43:49.500 --> 43:53.499
He's all yours.

44:34.100 --> 44:38.099
Fuck.

44:39.300 --> 44:42.379
Hello.

44:42.380 --> 44:43.259
Good night?

44:43.260 --> 44:45.299
Good night?
Yeah. Good.

44:45.300 --> 44:49.299
Really good.

44:54.940 --> 44:58.939
Is this OK?

45:02.940 --> 45:06.939
Try...

45:23.100 --> 45:26.579
Done you some sandwiches.
It's a long way to...

45:26.580 --> 45:27.819
Walton-on-the-Naze.

45:27.820 --> 45:29.459
...Naze. Whatever.

45:29.460 --> 45:31.619
Anyway...

45:31.620 --> 45:34.379
Oh!

45:34.380 --> 45:38.379
No egg, just cheese and pickle.
Don't want any teasing on the coach.

45:40.340 --> 45:44.139
Oh, who's let one go?!

45:44.140 --> 45:45.099
Stinker.

45:45.100 --> 45:47.299
That for saying I'm a slapper.

45:47.300 --> 45:51.299
See you later!

45:52.460 --> 45:57.159
Sigmund Freud, right,
father of modern psychoanalysis,
inventor of penis envy

45:57.860 --> 46:01.859
and all that bollocks,
said he never worked out
what it is a woman truly wants.

46:02.660 --> 46:06.659
In men's case he reckoned it was
down to two things, work and love.

46:06.700 --> 46:08.859
Obviously he never me my dad.

46:08.860 --> 46:10.259
So what did you tell them?

46:10.260 --> 46:11.139
As for our Debbie...

46:11.140 --> 46:14.899
Same as you. Walton-on-the-Naze.
Said it was a gospel camp.

46:14.900 --> 46:16.139
Gospel camp?

46:16.140 --> 46:17.899
Shut up.

46:17.900 --> 46:21.899
What are you now, one of the
commandments or something? Stop!

46:22.340 --> 46:24.659
Get off! You're such a weakling.

46:24.660 --> 46:25.939
I'm letting you win.

46:25.940 --> 46:29.939
Get off!

46:30.140 --> 46:33.299
Turns out our Debbie's not
that different after all.

46:33.300 --> 46:37.299
Like most women, all she wants is
love, work and her own fucking way!

46:38.860 --> 46:41.459
