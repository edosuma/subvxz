male announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.576 --> 00:12.280
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.548
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.582 --> 00:16.517
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.550 --> 00:18.152
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:18.186 --> 00:20.054
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.489
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.093
[knock at door]

00:34.135 --> 00:35.269
- HELLO.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.504
- HI.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.744
- WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS,
SWEETHEART?

00:43.777 --> 00:46.614
- OUT.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.282
- YOU PROBABLY GET LONELY.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.517
- I GUESS.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.821
- COME SIT HERE WITH ME.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.490
WE'LL WATCH TV, AND...

00:56.524 --> 00:58.759
WE'LL GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER.

00:58.792 --> 01:02.130
- I DON'T THINK--
- OH, SHH SHH SHH.

01:02.163 --> 01:07.668
WE WILL GO AS SLOW
AS YOU WANT, BABY DOLL.

01:07.701 --> 01:11.372
JUST LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.675
WHERE DID YOU COME--

01:14.708 --> 01:18.379
HEY, I KNOW YOU.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.116
- ALICIA HARDING, HOST
OF NEIGHBORHOOD PREDATOR.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.252
- THIS IS NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.819
- THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
MR. CARLTON?

01:25.853 --> 01:28.256
YOU'RE A FATHER, A HUSBAND,
AND A SCHOOLTEACHER.

01:28.289 --> 01:32.260
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE EMAILS AND
CHILD PORN YOU SENT TO A MINOR?

01:32.293 --> 01:34.262
- GET READY TO MOVE IN.
- NEVER HAPPENED.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.829
THIS IS A SET-UP.

01:35.863 --> 01:38.532
- OH, HOW IS IT
A SET-UP, SIR?

01:38.566 --> 01:42.403
YOU BROUGHT THE BEER,
THE CONDOMS, AND THE LUBE.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.272
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.606
SEE, WE HAVE YOU ON TAPE.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.909
THE ROOM IS
WIRED WITH CAMERAS.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.580
COME. LOOK.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.183
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?

01:58.919 --> 02:01.855
- GO! GO! GO!

02:01.889 --> 02:05.125
[TASER buzzing]

02:06.360 --> 02:07.628
- AMATEUR.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.931
- ARE YOU OKAY?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.266
- NEVER BETTER.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.434
THAT WAS GREAT WORK.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.702
- HAND OVER THE TASER.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.270
- UNIFORMS ALREADY TOOK IT.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.772
- GUY COULD WALK OFF
YOUR TRIGGER-HAPPY FINGER.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.642
- OH, CARLTON ISN'T GOING
ANYWHERE BUT PRISON, FIN.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.845
- OH, HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.548
- HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE CIVILIANS
TRYING TO DO HIS JOB.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.618
- YEAH, WELL, HIS NAME ON 18
ARRESTS SHOULD SOOTHE THE STING.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.885
- SHE DOES A HELL OF A JOB

02:31.919 --> 02:33.621
GETTING THESE GUYS
OFF THE STREET.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.224
- AN OFFICER ASKED ME TO DELIVER
THIS TO YOU, MS. HARDING.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.458
- OH, THANKS.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.693
YOU KNOW,
I'M USED TO COPS' ATTITUDES,

02:39.727 --> 02:42.162
SO DON'T WASTE YOUR BREATH,
SONYA.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.437
- IS THAT BLOOD?

02:57.978 --> 02:59.680
- THAT'S MY LUCKY SCARF.

02:59.713 --> 03:00.848
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW IT?

03:00.881 --> 03:04.885
- THIS MORNING, ON MY BED.

03:04.918 --> 03:08.656
- YOU HAVE A STALKER.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.012
- I'M ON TV. I GET TONS
OF EMAILS ALL THE TIME,

04:05.045 --> 04:07.047
A FEW SAYING,
"I'M WATCHING YOU."

04:07.080 --> 04:09.283
HARDLY COUNTS AS A THREAT.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.051
- AND WHAT DO YOU CALL
YOUR BLOODY SCARF,

04:11.084 --> 04:13.721
DELIVERED BY WHAT A P.A.
SAID WAS A COP?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.556
- A REASON TO DOUBLE
MY SECURITY,

04:15.589 --> 04:17.758
BUT I'M NOT GONNA STOP
GOING AFTER SCUMBAGS.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.394
- YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME SOMEONE
WAS AFTER YOU, ALICIA.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.929
- I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF,
SONYA.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.731
- YOU'VE HAD MORE THAN ONE
THREATENING EMAIL,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.333
AND THIS GUY BROKE
INTO YOUR HOME.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.801
- SO, DO HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
WHO DID THIS?

04:27.835 --> 04:29.870
- ANY ONE OF 100 GUYS
I'VE BAGGED

04:29.903 --> 04:33.507
FOR PREYING ON YOUNG GIRLS,
OR THEIR FAMILIES.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.743
HELL, THERE ARE EVEN A FEW
POLITICIANS WHO HATE MY GUTS.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.944
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE?

04:36.977 --> 04:38.446
- I DON'T HAVE ONE.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.747
WHEN I'M NOT WORKING
ON THE SHOW,

04:39.780 --> 04:42.516
I'M FOLLOWING LEADS
ON VANESSA'S ABDUCTION.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.855
- HER 13-YEAR-OLD SISTER WENT
MISSING 25 YEARS AGO.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.823
MY CASE.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.425
STILL OPEN.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.993
- ALL THEY FOUND WERE
HER BLOODY CLOTHES,

04:53.026 --> 04:55.028
A FEW KNIFE CUTS
IN HER T-SHIRT.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.598
IT'S WHY I GO AFTER PREDATORS.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.567
- HOW DID HE KNOW
THE SCARF WAS SPECIAL?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.635
- BELONGED TO MY SISTER.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.771
I SAID IT
ON AIR MORE THAN ONCE.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.906
- USUAL SUSPECTS FIRST.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.641
LOVERS?

05:07.675 --> 05:11.479
- I HAVE SEX WITH A JOURNALIST
COVERING THE AFGHAN DRUG TRADE.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.680
IT'S CASUAL.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.047
- WHERE IS HE NOW?
- OVERSEAS.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.916
HOPPED A TRANSPORT
THREE DAYS AGO.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.686
- HAVE YOU
FIRED ANYONE RECENTLY?

05:18.719 --> 05:20.488
- NOT IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.490
PERSONNEL FILES ARE
IN MY OFFICE.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.858
FEEL FREE TO WASTE YOUR TIME
GOING THROUGH THEM.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.059
- THIS ISN'T A STRANGER.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.928
THIS IS SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS YOUR ROUTINE.

05:27.961 --> 05:28.829
- YOU MEAN SOMEONE I TRUST.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.864
THAT NARROWS IT DOWN
TO ALMOST NO ONE.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.933
- THREATS WERE SENT
TO YOUR PERSONAL EMAIL,

05:32.966 --> 05:35.469
AND THE SCARF WAS TAKEN
FROM YOUR BED, ALICIA.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.771
- THE NUT JOB COULD'VE
JUST FOLLOWED ME HOME.

05:37.805 --> 05:38.939
- ARE YOU MISSING
A CELL PHONE,

05:38.972 --> 05:41.409
UM, ANY PDAs,
APPOINTMENT BOOK?

05:41.442 --> 05:42.776
- NO.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.012
- THEN HOW DOES HE HAVE ACCESS
TO YOUR PRIVATE EMAIL?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.814
- I DON'T KNOW.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.782
- SO LET ME FIND OUT.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.087
- LAB'S STILL WORKING
ON THE SCARF.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.424
THE BLOOD IS HUMAN,
NO MORE THAN TWO DAYS OLD.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.392
- IT'S A CREATIVE WAY
TO SEND A THREAT.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.561
- SOMETHING BUMPING FOR YOU?

06:00.594 --> 06:03.797
- ALICIA HARDING DOESN'T REPORT
THE NEWS, SHE MAKES IT.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.499
- YOU THINK SHE MADE THIS UP?

06:05.533 --> 06:08.669
- EMAILS WERE SENT
FROM A BOGUS I.P.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.637
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME

06:09.670 --> 06:12.072
A REPORTER FABRICATED
A STORY FOR RATINGS.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.807
- I DON'T THINK
SHE'D USE THE SCARF

06:13.841 --> 06:15.676
OF HER DEAD SISTER
AS A HOAX.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.945
- I CHECKED WITH EVERYONE
WORKING THE PERV STING,

06:17.978 --> 06:20.448
AND NO ONE HANDED THE KID A BOX
TO DELIVER TO HARDING.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.715
- WHICH MEANS THAT OUR STALKER

06:21.749 --> 06:24.017
IMPERSONATED A COP
ON A STREET FULL OF THEM.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.787
- WELL, THAT'S WHY I FORWARDED
THE EMAILS TO ELLIOT.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.556
ASKED HIM TO WORK UP
A THREAT ASSESSMENT

06:28.589 --> 06:30.090
WHILE HE'S TRAINING
AT QUANTICO.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.692
- I THINK WE KNOW
WHAT THIS GUY WANTS.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.826
HE BROKE INTO HARDING'S HOME.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.595
- AND WE NEED TO FIND OUT HOW,

06:34.628 --> 06:36.964
SO GET CSU TO MEET YOU
AT HER APARTMENT.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.702
- HAVEN'T FOUND
ANYTHING YET, DETECTIVE.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.103
- CHECK BETWEEN THOSE SHEETS

06:43.136 --> 06:44.705
IN CASE HE LEFT US
A NASTY LITTLE GIFT.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.706
- RIGHT.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.741
- VICTIM'S PANTIES?

06:47.775 --> 06:48.709
- FOUND THEM SOAKING
IN THE SINK.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.711
PROBABLY GOT OFF USING THEM.
- ANY FLUIDS?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.480
- NO, THEY WERE SWIMMING
IN CHLORINE.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.548
- OKAY, SO THE DNA'S
TOTALLY DESTROYED.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.783
THIS GUY TOOK HIS TIME.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.050
HE KNEW THAT SHE LIVED ALONE

06:57.084 --> 06:59.119
SO HE WOULDN'T
BE INTERRUPTED.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.854
UH, ANY SIGNS
OF FORCED ENTRY?

07:00.888 --> 07:01.989
- NO, NO SIGNS OF IT.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.524
- CAMERAS IN FRONT
OF THE BUILDING?

07:03.557 --> 07:04.958
- ONLY A SECURITY PAD
AT THE FRONT DOOR.

07:04.992 --> 07:08.161
RESIDENTS
LIKE THEIR PRIVACY.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.063
- HEY, LIV,
CHECK THIS OUT.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.503
IT'S LIKE HERE SISTER
DISAPPEARED YESTERDAY

07:15.536 --> 07:17.004
INSTEAD OF 25 YEARS AGO.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.825
- FIVES,

07:37.858 --> 07:39.226
LAB REPORTS.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.531
CRIME SCENE PHOTOS
OF HER SISTER'S CLOTHES.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.199
HOW DID ALICIA GET EVIDENCE
TO AN OPEN MURDER?

07:48.702 --> 07:50.270
- SONYA PAXTON.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.773
SHE'S BEEN AFTER THE PERP
FOR DECADES,

07:52.806 --> 07:54.542
PLUS SHE'S CLOSE TO HARDING.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.209
SHE COULD'VE HANDED
THE FILES RIGHT TO HER.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.246
- IF WE'RE LUCKY, THIS GUY
TOUCHED ONE OF THE PAGES

07:59.279 --> 08:01.214
OR HE PULLED OUT
ONE THESE PHOTOS.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.551
HE'S OBSESSED WITH ALICIA.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.218
HE GETS OFF ON SCARING HER.

08:05.252 --> 08:08.155
- THE HUMPS SHE CATCHES
ON HER SHOW LIKE YOUNG GIRLS.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.923
THEY DON'T ACT LIKE THIS.

08:09.957 --> 08:13.827
- BUT MAYBE THE FEDS
HAVE SOMEONE WHO DOES.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.295
THAT'S A GOOD LOOK FOR YOU.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.564
- THANK YOU.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.831
QUANTICO'S GOT
A LOT OF NEW TOYS.

08:17.865 --> 08:18.932
I COULDN'T RESIST
HOGAN'S ALLEY,

08:18.966 --> 08:20.167
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.235
- YOU HAVE ANY CHANCE TO GO
THROUGH ALICIA HARDING'S EMAILS?

08:22.269 --> 08:25.739
- YEP, AND THE BEHAVIORAL GUYS
DID ALSO.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.941
THIS IS
THE WORST KIND OF STALKER.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.810
HE'S, UH, SMART,

08:29.843 --> 08:31.745
HE'S RESOURCEFUL, EXPERIENCED.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.714
- ANY M.O.
HITS IN VICAP?

08:33.747 --> 08:35.148
- NO, BUT THEY THINK
HE'S IN CODIS,

08:35.182 --> 08:36.717
SINCE HE DIDN'T LEAVE
ANY TRACE EVIDENCE

08:36.750 --> 08:37.985
AND HE DESTROYED HIS DNA.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.820
- ANY IDEAS WHAT SET HIM OFF?

08:39.853 --> 08:41.989
- WELL, ALICIA HARDING'S
A HIGH-PROFILE TARGET

08:42.022 --> 08:44.057
WHO CLAIMS
TO HUNT DOWN PREDATORS,

08:44.091 --> 08:46.727
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S
NEVER REALLY ACTUALLY MET ONE.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.596
- WELL, SHE HAS HELPED COLLAR
DOZENS OF GUYS.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.163
- WELL, NOT LIKE THIS ONE.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.765
THIS IS A HARDCORE PREDATOR,

08:51.799 --> 08:54.735
AND THEY DON'T GET MUCH
OF A CHALLENGE OUT OF STALKING,

08:54.768 --> 08:56.837
SO HE'S GONNA SHOW
HIMSELF SOON.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.172
- MEANING THAT
IF HE CAN'T GET AT ALICIA,

08:59.206 --> 09:01.241
HE MIGHT TRY
TO TAKE SOMEONE ELSE.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.710
- WELL, JUST MAKE SURE
IT'S NOT YOU, OKAY?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.177
YOU WANT ME
TO CUT MY VISIT SHORT?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.246
- NO. NO, I'M COVERED.
I'M GOOD.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.616
- WELL, FIN MAY HAVE YOUR SIX,
BUT HE'S DEFINITELY NOT ME.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.050
- NO, I'M BETTER.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.919
I ACTUALLY WATCH HER BACK,
AND NOT HER BACKSIDE.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.954
- SEE YA.

09:13.987 --> 09:18.826
- YOU'RE REALLY
GONNA LOVE THIS.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.061
CROWD SHOTS FROM
A NEIGHBORHOOD PREDATOR STING.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.096
ONE FACE KEEPS STICKING OUT.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.767
AN I.T. ENGINEER
NAMED SCOTT LASKIE.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.169
HE GOT CAUGHT IN A BROOKLYN NET
LAST YEAR.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.039
ONE ARREST, NO CONVICTION.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.040
- WHERE HE IS NOW?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.274
- INTERROGATION.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.343
I HAD UNIS PICK HIM UP.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.344
- I'M INVOKING.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.946
- YOU'RE NOT UNDER ARREST.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.280
- COULD'VE FOOLED ME.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.916
CUSTODY BEGAN THE MOMENT
POLICE CAME TO MY JOB

09:42.950 --> 09:44.317
AND MADE A SHOW
OF TAKING ME IN.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.119
- LOOK, WE'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR ANSWERS.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.956
- NO, YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO CLOSE A CASE.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.157
BIG DIFFERENCE.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.191
- NOT IF I GOT THE WRONG GUY.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.860
- THE TRUTH DOESN'T MATTER.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.795
IF IT DID, I NEVER
WOULD'VE BEEN ARRESTED.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.697
- LOOK, YOU WERE CAUGHT
IN A STING

09:56.730 --> 09:57.998
TRYING TO HAVE SEX
WITH A MINOR.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.367
- THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
- I GET IT.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.169
YOU'RE INNOCENT
AND NOBODY LISTENED TO YOU.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.403
MUST'VE MADE YOU ANGRY.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.437
- MY REPUTATION'S IN RUINS,

10:04.471 --> 10:06.306
EVEN THOUGH THE PROSECUTOR
DROPPED THE CHARGES.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.641
- SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD REASON FOR YOU

10:07.675 --> 10:09.276
TO LASH OUT
AT ALICIA HARDING.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.947
YOU HAVE THE KNOW-HOW TO CREATE
AN ANONYMOUS I.P. ADDRESS.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.783
DID YOU SEND HER
THREATENING EMAILS,

10:15.816 --> 10:17.084
BREAK INTO HER HOUSE?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.919
- NICE TRY, PEACHES.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.322
I SUGGEST YOU COME BACK
WHEN MY LAWYER GETS HERE.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.991
- HE'S A WALL.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.193
- WHO KNOWS ENOUGH ABOUT THE LAW
TO CAUSE A STINK.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.028
- THERE'S
NO CUSTODIAL ISSUE HERE, DON.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.429
HE'S FREE TO GO
WHENEVER HE WANTS.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.798
- OH, HE'S NOT BUDGING.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.899
- HE'S GOT AN AX TO GRIND.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.301
- MAYBE, BUT WHY DID
THE PROSECUTOR DROP THE CHARGES?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.203
- I'LL MAKE THE CALL.
- DON'T BOTHER.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.438
A FRIEND AT THE NETWORK PULLED
THE RAW FOOTAGE

10:38.471 --> 10:41.241
THE NIGHT SCOTT LASKIE
GOT STUNG.

10:41.274 --> 10:44.011
- IT'S LATE.
WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.979
- GONE. COME ON IN.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.881
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE ALONE HERE.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.683
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

10:49.717 --> 10:51.852
- DON'T YOU WANT TO PARTY?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.353
ALL THOSE THINGS
YOU SAID ONLINE.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.923
YOU PROMISED
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.891
- MY GOD.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.392
IS SOMEONE COMING OVER HERE?

10:59.426 --> 11:02.129
CALL THE POLICE.
- WHAT FOR?

11:02.162 --> 11:04.197
- I READ YOUR EMAILS.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.834
YOU CAN'T TELL MEN
YOU'LL GET NAKED

11:06.867 --> 11:08.335
AND SAY THEY CAN TOUCH YOU.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.103
YOU'RE ASKING FOR TROUBLE.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.073
PLEASE. CALL THE POLICE.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.274
- OKAY.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.344
AND THIS IS THE VERSION
NEIGHBORHOOD PREDATOR AIRED.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.713
- COME ON IN.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.782
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE HERE ALONE.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.216
GET NAKED.

11:23.250 --> 11:27.220
- DO THOSE THINGS
YOU SAID ONLINE.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.790
TAKE CARE OF ME.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.126
- MY GOD.
YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.766
- LASKIE WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP THE GIRL, SONYA.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.067
- YEAH, RIGHT INTO BED.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.334
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.469
THEY NAILED THE GUY
WITH DOCTORED FOOTAGE.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.872
- PLEASE. HE ENDED UP AT
A MINOR'S HOUSE LATE AT NIGHT.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.306
WHY NOT GO STRAIGHT
TO THE COPS?

11:46.339 --> 11:48.475
- WELL, THAT'S THE FIRST THING
I'M GONNA ASK HIS LAWYER.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.443
- COME ON, GUYS,
WE'RE WASTING TIME HERE.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.046
IF HE'S NOT STALKING ALICIA,
SOMEONE ELSE IS.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.248
- YEAH, LIKE SOME OTHER GUY
SHE FRAMED.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.084
- I HAVE A FEELING
THAT THE SUSPECT POOL

11:57.117 --> 11:59.052
JUST GOT DEEPER.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.926
- POLICE HARASSMENT,
FALSE ARREST.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.861
IS THERE ANYTHING
I'M MISSING?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.296
- CYBER STALKING, BURGLARY.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.898
- MORE AMMUNITION
FOR THE CIVIL SUIT

12:10.931 --> 12:14.067
AGAINST NYPD
AND THAT TV NETWORK.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.168
- CUT THE DRAMA, HESHY.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.905
YOUR CLIENT VOLUNTARILY
SURRENDERED FOR QUESTIONING.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.306
- AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'S INVOLVED?

12:19.339 --> 12:20.173
- MOTIVE.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.875
SCOTT LASKIE HAS
A PRETTY SERIOUS GRUDGE

12:21.909 --> 12:22.876
AGAINST ALICIA HARDING.

12:22.910 --> 12:26.079
- WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE?

12:26.113 --> 12:27.280
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
WE'RE LEAVING.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.117
- NOT UNTIL THE COPS PROMISE
TO LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.185
- I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL,
MR. LASKIE.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.154
I SAW THE TAPE.
- WHICH VERSION?

12:34.187 --> 12:35.889
MY EX-WIFE SAW
THE ONE THAT AIRED.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.390
I'VE GOT
A 12-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.092
UNTIL THIS GETS CLEARED UP,

12:39.126 --> 12:41.194
MY VISITATION RIGHTS
ARE SUSPENDED.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.163
- I SAW BOTH VERSIONS.

12:43.196 --> 12:46.033
NOW, IF YOU WANTED TO HELP,
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL THE POLICE?

12:46.066 --> 12:47.334
- HE TRIED.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.269
THEY SAID THEY'D LOOK INTO IT,
BUT DIDN'T.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.438
- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

12:51.471 --> 12:53.440
- I WORRY ABOUT MY KID
ON THE INTERNET,

12:53.473 --> 12:55.408
SO I STARTED
CHECKING WEBSITES

12:55.442 --> 12:57.377
WHEN I RAN ACROSS
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A YOUNG GIRL

12:57.410 --> 12:58.511
IN A PUBLIC CHAT ROOM.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.113
- DID YOU CHAT WITH THE GIRL?

13:00.147 --> 13:02.582
- NO, BUT I READ
WHAT OTHER MEN WERE SAYING.

13:02.615 --> 13:06.186
THEY OFFERED CELL PHONES, iPODS,
EVEN MONEY JUST TO MEET HER.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.587
I DIDN'T WANT
TO STICK MY NECK OUT,

13:07.620 --> 13:11.058
BUT WHAT IF IT WAS MY KID?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.960
- HOW DID YOU GET
THE GIRL'S ADDRESS?

13:12.993 --> 13:15.528
- I HACKED THE SERVER.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.297
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.966
THIS INTERVIEW IS OVER
UNLESS YOU READ HIM HIS RIGHTS

13:18.999 --> 13:20.033
OR DECLINE TO FILE.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.134
- I DON'T WANT THE PAPERWORK.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.371
JUST ADVISE YOUR CLIENT
TO OBEY THE LAW FROM NOW ON.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.273
- THE LAW WASN'T INTERESTED
IN PROTECTING THAT GIRL.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.241
I WASN'T GOING TO
LET HER GET RAPED.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.943
- AND THAT'S WHY YOU WENT
OVER TO HER APARTMENT?

13:29.977 --> 13:31.344
- AFTER I WALKED
INTO A PRECINCT

13:31.378 --> 13:34.314
AND HANDED A COPY OF THE
CHAT LOGS TO A DESK SERGEANT.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.617
WHEN HE CALLED ME A KOOK,
I WENT TO THE HOUSE.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.019
- WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME

13:39.052 --> 13:42.222
LASKIE HAS A SOLID CASE
FOR WRONGFUL ARREST.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.523
WHICH PRECINCT DID HE GO TO?

13:43.556 --> 13:45.959
- THE 7-2.
FIN'S TALKING TO THEM NOW.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.328
- YOU'RE NOT BLAMING ALICIA
FOR THIS.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.363
- PLAYING COP
DOESN'T MAKE HER ONE.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.365
- ALICIA DIDN'T ARREST HIM,
THE COPS DID.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.367
- BASED ON FABRICATED EVIDENCE
THAT SHE HANDED TO THEM.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.103
- WAIT, SHE'S THE VICTIM
HERE, REMEMBER?

13:56.136 --> 14:00.607
- SONYA, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO JUDGE.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.442
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
ON HER SISTER'S MURDER

14:02.475 --> 14:04.511
FOR, WHAT, 20 YEARS?
- 25 YEARS.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.547
- 25. SO HOW OLD
WAS ALICIA BACK THEN?

14:07.580 --> 14:08.748
- 17.

14:08.781 --> 14:12.619
LOOK, WHEN SERIAL MURDERS
STARTED EXPLODING IN THE '80s,

14:12.652 --> 14:16.256
WE DIDN'T KNOW HALF
OF WHAT WE KNOW NOW.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.158
OKAY, WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
DATABASES.

14:18.191 --> 14:23.463
WE WERE ALL JUST SCRAMBLING
IN AN EPIDEMIC OF SNATCHED KIDS.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.533
SOMETIMES ALL WE FOUND
WERE BODY PARTS, REMEMBER?

14:26.566 --> 14:31.004
IF WE FOUND ANYTHING AT ALL.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.272
- LIKE VANESSA HARDING.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.540
- YEAH, SO, YOU KNOW,

14:33.573 --> 14:35.475
IF YOU THINK I HELD
ALICIA'S HAND TOO LONG

14:35.508 --> 14:37.677
OR GAVE HER TOO MUCH
INFORMATION, THAT'S TOUGH.

14:37.710 --> 14:41.414
I CALLED HER WHEN WE GOT A LEAD,
AND SHE CALLED ME.

14:41.448 --> 14:44.051
- SHE SHOULDN'T BE DIGGING
INTO HER SISTER'S MURDER.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.118
IT'S NOT HEALTHY.

14:45.152 --> 14:48.588
- AND HOW LONG DID YOU SEARCH
FOR THE MAN WHO...

14:48.621 --> 14:50.590
RAPED YOUR MOTHER?

14:55.662 --> 14:59.499
- CAPTAIN, DESK SERGEANT
CORROBORATES LASKIE'S STORY,

14:59.532 --> 15:02.469
BUT THEY JACKED HIM ANYWAY
BASED ON THE TAPE.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.437
- VOID LASKIE'S ARREST,

15:04.471 --> 15:07.340
AND THEN GO SHAKE
ALICIA HARDING'S TREE.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.085
- UH, I CHANGED YOUR LOCKS.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.386
WHO GETS COPIES?

15:19.419 --> 15:20.387
- NO ONE.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.022
HER APARTMENT IS OFF LIMITS.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.456
SPREAD THE WORD.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.392
- GIVE US A MINUTE, RACHEL.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.199
- WHO ELSE HAS KEYS
TO YOUR APARTMENT?

15:32.232 --> 15:36.203
- UH, MY STAFF--HAIR, MAKEUP,
WARDROBE, MY ASSISTANT.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.138
- I NEED NAMES.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.439
- THEY'VE BEEN WITH ME
FOR YEARS.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.740
- YOU STILL DON'T GET IT.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.609
ALICIA,
SOMEBODY IS AFTER YOU.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.644
LEAST NOW WE KNOW WHY.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.981
HOW MANY MEN DID YOU
RAILROAD INTO PRISON?

15:48.015 --> 15:50.583
- MISTAKES WERE MADE
WITH SCOTT LASKIE.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.053
THERE WEREN'T ANY OTHERS.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.487
- WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU?

15:54.521 --> 15:56.289
- BECAUSE
I'M A JOURNALIST, OLIVIA.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.125
- WHO DOESN'T CHECK HER FACTS.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.259
- OH, SO YOU JUST DECIDE
I'M GUILTY

15:59.292 --> 16:01.628
AND YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN HEARING AN EXPLANATION?

16:01.661 --> 16:04.031
- PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.570
- THE NIGHT LASKIE
SHOWED UP,

16:10.603 --> 16:14.107
MEN JUST KEPT COMING,
ONE RIGHT AFTER THE NEXT.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.775
WE HAD TO RUSH A COUPLE
OUT THE BACK DOOR

16:15.808 --> 16:17.777
SO THEY WOULDN'T RUN
INTO EACH OTHER.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.646
THEN THE COPS
BROUGHT THEM IN

16:19.679 --> 16:22.015
BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE
TO INTERVIEW THEM.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.084
- THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN
YOU DOCTORING THE FOOTAGE.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.118
- I DIDN'T.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.720
THE NETWORK WANTED
A RECORD NUMBER OF ARRESTS.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.490
A PRODUCER THOUGHT SWEETENING
HIS TAPE WOULD MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.125
I SWEAR I DIDN'T KNOW.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.327
- SO YOU JUST PASSED THE BUCK
TO SAVE YOUR OWN ASS.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.395
- IT'S THE TRUTH.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.297
I FIRED THE BASTARD
SIX MONTHS AGO,

16:37.330 --> 16:38.665
AND I HAVE CHECKED
AND RE-CHECKED

16:38.698 --> 16:40.433
EVERY FRAME OF COVERAGE SINCE.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.302
- I NEED THIS PRODUCER'S NAME.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.336
- DONNY SPENCER.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.572
MY ASSISTANT RACHEL
CAN GIVE YOU THE ADDRESS.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.207
HE WAS PRETTY PISSED
WHEN I SACKED HIM,

16:47.240 --> 16:49.576
SO, YOU KNOW,
HE'S NOT MY BIGGEST FAN.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.313
- YOU SEEM TO HAVE
THAT EFFECT ON EVERYONE.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.819
- NYPD.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.622
- ALICIA HARDING
HAS A STALKER.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.625
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

17:05.658 --> 17:09.429
- COULDN'T HAPPEN
TO A NICER SOW.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.364
- NICE WAY TO IMPLICATE
YOURSELF.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.766
- I DID HER A FAVOR,
AND SHE CANNED ME.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.468
- SO SHE ASKED YOU
TO ALTER THE FOOTAGE?

17:15.502 --> 17:16.569
- HELL, YEAH.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.271
AND NOW I HEAR
SHE'S SANDBAGGING ME

17:18.305 --> 17:19.339
FOR JOB INTERVIEWS?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.074
THE BITCH HAS TO BE STOPPED.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.176
- SO IF YOU STALK HER,
SHE'S TOO BUSY WATCHING HER BACK

17:23.210 --> 17:24.711
TO SCREW
WITH YOUR JOB SEARCH.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.079
- THAT'S CRAZY.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.081
- DO YOU HAVE A KEY
TO HER APARTMENT?

17:28.115 --> 17:29.849
MAYBE YOU LIFTED IT,
MADE A COPY FOR YOURSELF?

17:29.882 --> 17:32.419
- SO THE WHORE GETS A FEW EMAILS
AND NOW YOU'RE IN MY FACE?

17:32.452 --> 17:35.588
- THAT'S FUNNY, I DIDN'T MENTION
ANYTHING ABOUT EMAILS...DONNY.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.362
- IN HERE.

17:45.232 --> 17:48.135
YOU CAN TELL ALICIA
THAT I FOUND HER STALKER.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.169
- I DON'T THINK SO.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.404
- UH, DONNY SPENCER
JUST CONFESSED IN THE CAR

17:51.438 --> 17:53.440
THAT HE SENT
THREATENING EMAILS.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.308
- ALICIA BROUGHT IN
ANOTHER EMAIL

17:55.342 --> 17:56.543
WITH AN ATTACHED PHOTO.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.411
IT LOOKED AUTHENTIC,
SO WE HAD IT PROCESSED.

17:58.445 --> 17:59.846
- A PHOTO OF WHAT?

17:59.879 --> 18:02.415
- A BODY DUMP
OF A YOUNG GIRL.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.354
- PHOTO OF
A DUMPED WHITE FEMALE,

18:07.387 --> 18:09.689
DEAD WEEDS,
BROKEN-DOWN SWING.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.424
NOT MUCH TO GO ON.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.194
I TRACED THE EMAILS
TO A WIRELESS CAFE.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.695
PAID CASH, NO CAMERAS.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.897
- LAB HERE SAYS
THE PIXELS LINE UP.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.267
BODY'S REAL, SIMILAR
TO A DUMP IN MARYLAND.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.368
- SAME GUY?

18:21.401 --> 18:23.703
- ONLY WARNER
CAN TELL YOU THAT.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.238
- ANY IDEA
WHERE IT'S LOCATED?

18:25.272 --> 18:27.907
- NOT WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE
LANDMARKS OR BUILDINGS.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.843
SHOULD WE BE TALKING ABOUT THIS
IN FRONT OF A CIVILIAN?

18:30.877 --> 18:33.313
- ALICIA NEEDS TO KNOW
WHAT SHE'S UP AGAINST.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.415
- OKAY, WELL,
OUR PERP'S A SOCIOPATH,

18:35.448 --> 18:37.917
AND SHE DEALS WITH TEACHERS
DIDDLING THEIR STUDENTS.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.619
- DOES KNOWING
THE DEAD GIRL'S LOCATION

18:39.652 --> 18:40.787
EARN ME A SEAT
AT THE TABLE?

18:40.820 --> 18:43.156
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?

18:43.190 --> 18:47.160
- THIS IS THE LAST PLACE
MY SISTER WAS SEEN ALIVE.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.795
- THERE'S NOTHING IN THE FIVES
ABOUT VANESSA

18:48.828 --> 18:51.398
BEING SEEN ALIVE
AFTER SHE LEFT HOME.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.401
- I INTERVIEWED A WOMAN WHO SAID
SHE SAW VANESSA IN THIS PARK.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.935
ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF CALLS
INTO THE TIP LINE

18:55.968 --> 18:57.870
THAT THE COPS
COULDN'T GET TO.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.672
- MAYBE IT'S
ANOTHER PLACE.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.841
- I'D KNOW IT ANYWHERE.
I SEARCHED EVERY INCH OF IT.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.276
- WELL, THEN WHY
DIDN'T YOU TELL THE POLICE?

19:03.310 --> 19:05.412
- BETTER YET,
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

19:05.445 --> 19:06.679
- IT'S A COLD CASE.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.281
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WORKING IT NOW.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.682
- THE HELL YOU ARE.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.384
I'VE BEEN CHASING
AFTER THIS BASTARD

19:11.418 --> 19:12.585
A LOT LONGER THAN YOU HAVE.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.920
- THEN WHERE IS HE?

19:13.953 --> 19:16.789
MY SISTER IS DEAD.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.791
NO ONE WANTS HIM
MORE THAN ME.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.194
- LADY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
THE KILLER BY YOURSELF.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.862
THIS GUY'S EITHER DEAD
OR IN PRISON.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.665
- NO, HE'S NOT.
HE'S STALKING ME.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.535
- NO, ALICIA,
THIS IS NOT THE SAME GUY.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.304
THE HUMP WHO SENT
THESE EMAILS IS DIFFERENT.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.972
HE'S FIXATED ON YOU,
NOT YOUR SISTER.

19:33.005 --> 19:37.610
- LOOK, THE ANALYSTS HERE THINK
HE'S EARLY 30S TO MID 40S.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.979
SO THAT MAKES HIM TOO YOUNG
TO HAVE KILLED VANESSA.

19:40.012 --> 19:40.947
- OH, SPARE ME.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.684
THE D.C. SNIPER HAD
TO BE WHITE AND ALONE.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.586
YOU NEVER CAUGHT THE ZODIAC,

19:46.619 --> 19:49.989
AND BUNDY WAS 14
WHEN HE MADE HIS FIRST KILL.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.591
YOUR ANALYSTS
DON'T KNOW DICK.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.693
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.728
WHERE IS THE PARK,
MS. HARDING?

19:55.762 --> 19:57.297
- I CAN SHOW YOU.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.164
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.999
- THEN GOOD LUCK
FINDING HER WITHOUT ME.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.701
- ALICIA, THIS ISN'T A GAME.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.636
A WOMAN IS DEAD,
AND WE NEED TO FIND HER.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.873
- EITHER TAKE ME WITH YOU
OR FOLLOW ME THERE.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.408
THOSE ARE MY TERMS.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.020
- YOU STAY RIGHT THERE.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.756
YOU MOVE, I'M HANDCUFFING
YOU TO THAT DOOR.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.393
- HEY, I DIDN'T ASK
FOR THIS.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.694
THE GUY SENT ME THE PHOTO.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.496
HE WANTS ME
TO SEE WHAT HE'S DONE.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.499
- HE WANTS YOU TO MAKE HIM
FAMOUS WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.634
- THE MAN KILLED MY SISTER.
I KNOW IT'S THE SAME GUY.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.370
- HAND ME YOUR PHONE
AND GET BACK IN THE DAMN CAR.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.907
- GO ON.
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.357
- I FOUND HER!
CALL WARNER!

20:57.390 --> 21:01.361
- I'LL LET THE STATEN ISLAND
D.A. KNOW WE'RE HERE!

21:13.573 --> 21:15.575
- I FOUND ANOTHER ONE!

21:21.548 --> 21:22.949
- BODY NUMBER THREE!

21:22.982 --> 21:26.285
WE'RE GONNA NEED A FORENSIC TEAM
AND CADAVER DOG.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.097
- FIVE WHITE FEMALES,

21:38.130 --> 21:41.868
AVERAGE AGE MID-TEENS
TO MID-20s,

21:41.901 --> 21:43.670
VARYING STAGES OF DECOMP.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.872
- ANY IDEA HOW LONG
THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED?

21:45.905 --> 21:49.008
- FROM PREDATION, TISSUE LOSS,
AND ADIPOCERE,

21:49.041 --> 21:52.545
I'D SAY BETWEEN THREE MONTHS
AND TWO YEARS.

21:52.579 --> 21:55.615
CAUSE OF DEATH IS HOMICIDE
BY UNDETERMINED MEANS

21:55.648 --> 21:57.884
UNTIL I DE-FLESH
THE BONES.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.419
- PROBABLY ALL KILLED
THE SAME WAY.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.620
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

22:00.653 --> 22:01.821
- STAB WOUNDS.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.657
THIS SIXTH JANE DOE
DIED THREE DAYS AGO,

22:04.691 --> 22:06.726
THREE WOUNDS,
SIX INCHES DEEP.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.628
- STABBED IN THE CHEST,
STOMACH, AND BACK?

22:08.661 --> 22:10.830
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

22:10.863 --> 22:12.899
- I SAW VANESSA HARDING'S
RECOVERED T-SHIRT.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.434
SHOWED THE EXACT SAME WOUNDS.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.002
- SON OF A BITCH
IS A COPYCAT.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.037
- UNLESS IT REALLY
IS THE SAME GUY.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.973
- WITHOUT VANESSA'S BODY,
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHICH.

22:21.007 --> 22:25.912
A PREMORTEM STAB WOUND
SEVERED THE T-6 VERTEBRA.

22:25.945 --> 22:29.916
SHE WAS PARALYZED FROM THE CHEST
DOWN DURING THE ATTACK.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.050
- WAS SHE RAPED?

22:31.083 --> 22:33.052
- REPEATEDLY,
BUT NO FLUIDS.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.522
HE THEN STABBED HER
IN THE LEFT LUNG,

22:35.555 --> 22:36.623
COLLAPSING IT.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.757
- SO SHE'D STOP SCREAMING.

22:37.790 --> 22:38.991
SHE CAN'T BREATHE,
SHE CAN'T MOVE,

22:39.025 --> 22:41.794
AND THEN HE FINISHES HER OFF
WITH A KNIFE THRUST TO THE GUT.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.396
- ANY OTHER CUTS ON HER BODY?

22:43.430 --> 22:45.398
HAIRS, FIBERS, OR TRACE?

22:45.432 --> 22:47.867
- NO, BUT THE BLOWS
WERE PRECISE.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.069
THIS GUY KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.404
- HE'S BEEN AT IT A WHILE.

22:51.438 --> 22:52.805
OUR PERP HAS POLICE,

22:52.839 --> 22:54.541
FORENSIC,
AND MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE.

22:54.574 --> 22:55.708
- WHICH MAKES HIM
HARDER TO CATCH.

22:55.742 --> 22:59.479
- UNLESS HE MAKES A MISTAKE,
YOU WON'T EVEN GET CLOSE.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.627
- THIS MUST SEEM
LIKE DEJA VU.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.529
- BUT IT'S NOT.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.964
IT'S HAPPENING NOW,

23:17.997 --> 23:21.033
AND THIS TIME, I AM
NOT GONNA STOP TILL I GET HIM.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.836
- SONYA, YOU GOTTA
GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK.

23:23.870 --> 23:27.006
YOU WEREN'T THE ONLY ONE LOOKING
FOR VANESSA'S KILLER.

23:27.039 --> 23:30.977
- I MADE A DEATH-BED PROMISE
TO CATCH THE GUY

23:31.010 --> 23:33.446
WHEN ALICIA'S MOM
PASSED AWAY.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.648
- AND YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP
YOUR WORD EVER SINCE.

23:37.617 --> 23:41.053
- YOU WERE RIGHT.
I LET MYSELF GET TOO CLOSE.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.590
I KNEW I WAS IN TROUBLE
WHEN I STARTED DRINKING

23:43.623 --> 23:45.658
JUST TO FACE THEM
WITH NO NEWS,

23:45.692 --> 23:48.661
BAD NEWS, DEAD ENDS.

23:48.695 --> 23:51.163
[tearfully]
NOW I'M SOBER AND...

23:51.197 --> 23:53.032
I GET ANOTHER CHANCE.

23:53.065 --> 23:56.703
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD TAKE 25 YEARS.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.838
- SOME CASES GO COLD.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.607
- IT'S NOT COLD NOW.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.174
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.477
- ALICIA WAS RIGHT.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.479
IT'S THE SAME KILLER.
WHO ELSE COULD IT BE?

24:06.513 --> 24:10.149
- AFTER 25 YEARS,
WHY GO AFTER HER NOW?

24:10.182 --> 24:13.219
- A SOCIOPATH WANTS TO REMEMBER
A KILL ON HIS OWN TERMS, RIGHT?

24:13.252 --> 24:14.887
ALICIA'S
NOT LETTING HIM DO THAT.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.756
HE MUST BE FEELING
THE PRESSURE.

24:16.789 --> 24:20.092
- ONLY IF SHE'S CLOSING
IN ON HIM.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.029
WHAT'S THE VERY LAST LEAD
THAT ALICIA FOLLOWED?

24:23.062 --> 24:25.898
- OH, MY GOD.

24:25.932 --> 24:28.868
THREE MONTHS AGO,
SHE APPEALED TO THE PUBLIC

24:28.901 --> 24:31.538
FOR THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE KID
WHO FOUND VANESSA'S CLOTHES.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.471
- WHY?

24:32.505 --> 24:34.741
- FOR AN INTERVIEW
ON THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY

24:34.774 --> 24:36.909
OF HER SISTER'S DEATH.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.645
- SO THE COPS
MUST HAVE INTERVIEWED HIM.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.112
HIS NAME'S NOT IN THE FILE?

24:40.146 --> 24:42.181
- THERE WERE HUNDREDS
OF VOLUNTEERS

24:42.214 --> 24:44.884
IN COUNTLESS SEARCH PARTIES
COMBING THE AREA.

24:44.917 --> 24:48.521
- INCLUDING A VERY EAGER
AND EXCITED KILLER.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.957
WE'LL PULL THE NAMES ON
THE VOLUNTEER SIGN-IN SHEET.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.093
- AND COMPARE THEM
TO THE WITNESS STATEMENTS.

24:54.126 --> 24:57.697
IF THE PRICK'S IN THERE,
HE'S MINE.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.671
- YOU LOCATE THE KID
WHO DISCOVERED

25:04.704 --> 25:06.573
VANESSA HARDING'S
BLOODY CLOTHES?

25:06.606 --> 25:07.674
- SO FAR, THERE'S NO MATCHES

25:07.707 --> 25:09.075
BETWEEN WITNESSES
AND VOLUNTEERS.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.677
- THE RETIRED DETECTIVE
I TALKED TO

25:10.710 --> 25:12.111
IS DIGGING THROUGH
HIS OLD SPIRALS.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.680
HE SAID HE'D GET BACK TO ME.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.782
- WHY HAVEN'T WE PUT THIS
TOGETHER BEFORE NOW?

25:15.815 --> 25:17.216
- NO BODIES DROPPING.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.151
THE GUY LET IT COOL OFF,
LIKE BTK.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.853
- WELL, UNTIL
ALICIA STRESSED HIM OUT

25:20.887 --> 25:23.255
BY USING HER TV SHOW
TO BRING UP THE PAST.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.992
- SO IF THIS GUY'S STALKING HER,
WHY DID DONNY SPENCER CONFESS?

25:26.025 --> 25:28.194
- WELL, HE DID SEND
A THREATENING EMAIL

25:28.227 --> 25:31.297
WITH THE MESSAGE
"I'M WATCHING YOU"

25:31.330 --> 25:32.832
TAKEN FROM A DISTANCE.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.834
- PAYBACK FOR GETTING
TAKEN OFF THE SHOW.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.603
- AND THEN LATER,
ALICIA GOT ANOTHER EMAIL

25:36.636 --> 25:37.737
WITH THE SAME MESSAGE,

25:37.770 --> 25:40.740
BUT THE PHOTOS
TAKEN FROM CLOSER RANGE.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.875
- SPENCER CAN'T GET TOO NEAR
WITHOUT A CONFRONTATION.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.611
- THE KILLER FINDS OUT
ABOUT THE THREAT

25:44.644 --> 25:46.078
WHEN HE GETS ACCESS
TO ALICIA'S EMAIL.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.647
- THEN HE SLIPS
INTO HER HOUSE,

25:47.680 --> 25:49.849
GOES THROUGH HER MURDER BOOK
TO CHECK HER PROGRESS.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.150
- WHY NOT JUST KILL HER?

25:51.183 --> 25:52.852
- A NEWS REPORTER'S DEATH

25:52.885 --> 25:54.186
WOULD BRING
A LOT OF UNWANTED ATTENTION.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.321
HE COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.857
- SO HE LEADS US
TO A BODY DUMP INSTEAD?

25:57.890 --> 25:58.858
- MISDIRECTION.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.292
MURDER TRUMPS STALKING.

26:00.326 --> 26:03.029
- LOOK, WE FOCUS ON ALICIA,
WE'RE GONNA FIND THE KILLER.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.832
HE GOT HER PERSONAL INFORMATION
FROM SOMEBODY ON THE SHOW.

26:05.865 --> 26:06.866
- OR HE WORKS THERE.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.100
YOU RUN
EMPLOYEE BACKGROUNDS?

26:08.134 --> 26:09.235
- THEY ALL CHECK OUT.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.370
HER STAFF'S WORKED
FOR HER FOR YEARS.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.805
- SO IT'S AN OUTSIDER
WITH ACCESS.

26:12.839 --> 26:14.206
- CHECK THE SECURITY LOG,

26:14.240 --> 26:17.777
RUN DOWN EVERY MALE VISITOR
YOU FIND.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.780
- VISITORS HAVE TO SIGN IN
WITH PHOTO I.D., NO EXCEPTIONS.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.749
THEY'RE ISSUED A TEMPORARY PASS
WHILE THEY'RE HERE.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.383
- DO THEY HAVE ACCESS
TO THE OFFICES?

26:24.416 --> 26:26.619
- NOT UNLESS THEY'RE
ACCOMPANIED BY ONE OF US.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.254
THE SHOW'S TAPES ARE USED
AS TRIAL EVIDENCE,

26:28.287 --> 26:30.156
SO SECURITY'S PRETTY TIGHT.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.691
- YOU HAVE ANY REAR EXITS?

26:31.724 --> 26:32.859
- THEY'RE ALARMED.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.160
VISITORS COME IN
THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR,

26:34.193 --> 26:35.895
AND THEY GO OUT
THE SAME WAY.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.630
- OKAY, WE'RE GONNA
NEED TO SEE THOSE LOGS,

26:37.664 --> 26:38.464
DATING BACK SIX MONTHS.

26:38.497 --> 26:41.167
- YOU THINK
THE KILLER CAME HERE?

26:41.200 --> 26:43.035
- WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A KILLER?

26:43.069 --> 26:45.204
- ALICIA.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.374
SHE TAPED A MESSAGE LAST NIGHT
TO THE GUY STALKING HER.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.645
- YESTERDAY, I DISCOVERED
THE MAN STALKING ME

26:52.679 --> 26:54.280
IS A SERIAL KILLER.

26:54.313 --> 26:57.349
HE LED ME TO SIX WOMEN,
ROTTING IN A FIELD,

26:57.383 --> 27:00.186
THEIR YOUNG LIVES
CUT SHORT BY A COWARD.

27:00.219 --> 27:03.189
HE MURDERED THEM THE SAME WAY
HE KILLED MY SISTER,

27:03.222 --> 27:05.324
BY STABBING THEM IN THE BACK.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.960
I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.930
YOU ARE NOTHING
BUT A SEXUAL DEVIANT,

27:10.963 --> 27:14.266
SUFFERING FROM ERECTILE
DYSFUNCTION SO SEVERE,

27:14.300 --> 27:16.669
YOU HAVE TO RAPE
WITH A KNIFE.

27:16.703 --> 27:19.271
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

27:19.305 --> 27:23.342
STATE PROSECUTOR SONYA PAXTON
BELIEVES YOU SHOULD BE CAPTURED

27:23.375 --> 27:25.044
AND PUT AWAY FOR LIFE.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.747
I SAY YOU'RE NOT WORTH IT,

27:27.780 --> 27:32.351
AND YOU SHOULD BE PUT DOWN
LIKE THE RABID DOG THAT YOU ARE.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.353
- WE CAN'T LET HER
AIR THIS.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.122
SHE'S SETTING HERSELF UP
AS BAIT.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.757
- THE DUMB ASS
BELONGS IN JAIL.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.358
SHE JUST LEAKED
SIX OPEN HOMICIDES.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.392
- WHEN DOES THIS AIR?

27:40.426 --> 27:41.393
- IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

27:41.427 --> 27:42.962
- MAYBE CRAGEN CAN GET
THE NETWORK TO HOLD IT.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.030
[dialing cell phone]

27:45.397 --> 27:47.333
GUESS THE NETWORK
WOULDN'T PULL THE PLUG.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.969
CHIEF OF D'S IS ON HIS WAY,
AND WE GOT A NEW TASK FORCE.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.370
- PUTTING ON A SHOW
FOR THE PUBLIC.

27:51.403 --> 27:54.106
- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN A NEWS FEED GOES NATIONAL.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.709
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN
HOW ALICIA MANAGED TO RECORD

27:56.743 --> 27:58.177
DETAILS OF OUR CRIME SCENE?

27:58.210 --> 27:59.445
- CAPTAIN,
I TOOK HER A CELL PHONE.

27:59.478 --> 28:00.947
I DIDN'T GIVE HER
A CAVITY SEARCH.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.749
- BUT SHE
DIDN'T TAKE PAXTON'S.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.117
SONYA'S JUST AS FIXATED
ON THIS HUMP AS ALICIA.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.418
SHE'D DO ANYTHING
TO TAKE HIM DOWN.

28:06.452 --> 28:07.619
- EVEN DUMP HER OWN CAREER?

28:07.653 --> 28:10.122
- LAST TIME I TALKED TO HER,
THAT'S ALL SHE CARED ABOUT.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.490
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST FIND SONYA.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.925
I'LL HANDLE IT FROM THERE.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.426
GO.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.395
- DETECTIVES.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.930
SHE'S IN THERE.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.401
- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE BRAVE
OR JUST STUPID.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.036
- I WAS TIRED
OF WAITING FOR YOU.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.272
I WANTED MY LIFE BACK,
SO I TOOK IT.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.741
- YOU DON'T DO THAT
BY ENRAGING A MURDERER.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.977
- AND YOU DON'T CATCH
THE BASTARD BY DOING NOTHING.

28:31.010 --> 28:34.013
IT'S BETTER IF HE COMES AT ME
OFF-BALANCE AND RAGING.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.481
- AND WHOSE BRIGHT IDEA
WAS THAT?

28:35.514 --> 28:38.017
- MINE. SONYA HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.285
- OH, YEAH?
SO HOW'D YOU GET THE FOOTAGE

28:39.318 --> 28:40.519
WHEN I TOOK YOUR PHONE?

28:40.552 --> 28:42.955
- I HAD A BACKUP CAMERA
IN MY POCKET.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.190
- SO YOU'RE COVERING FOR HER.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.425
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE.
WHERE IS SHE?

28:46.458 --> 28:48.460
- SHE WANTED A DRINK
AND WENT TO A MEETING INSTEAD.

28:48.494 --> 28:49.996
LOOK, IF IT GIVES YOU
ANY COMFORT,

28:50.029 --> 28:52.098
SHE'S NOT TOO HAPPY
WITH ME, EITHER.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.465
- BUT SHE
WENT ALONG WITH IT.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.767
- SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.035
NO ONE WAS TALKING ME
OUT OF IT.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.938
- WHERE'S THE AA MEETING
BEING HELD THIS WEEK?

29:08.881 --> 29:10.917
- EXCUSE ME.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.518
HAS ANYBODY
SEEN THIS WOMAN?

29:12.551 --> 29:13.786
- MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.122
WE'RE ANONYMOUS
FOR A REASON.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.391
- SONYA'S CAR
IS STILL OUTSIDE.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.160
- YEAH. I'LL CHECK
THE LADIES ROOM.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.270
- [gasping]

29:31.303 --> 29:33.940
- FIN! I NEED HELP IN HERE!

29:33.973 --> 29:36.909
SONYA...SONYA.

29:36.943 --> 29:40.146
SONYA, YOU HANG ON THERE.
HANG ON.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.448
- CENTRAL, SEND UNITS
AND A BUS TO MY LOCATION!

29:42.481 --> 29:44.116
WE GOT MURDER SUSPECT
IN THE AREA--

29:44.150 --> 29:46.418
BOLO, BLOODY CLOTHES,
APPROACH WITH CAUTION!

29:46.452 --> 29:47.854
- FIN, HELP ME.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.288
HELP ME.
SHE CAN'T BREATHE.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.458
THERE YOU GO.
I GOT YOU, SONYA.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.093
- SONYA, YOU'RE GONNA
BE OKAY.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.561
- [whispering] IT'S OKAY.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.930
I GOT HIM.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.165
- SHH. HOLD ON.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.312
SONYA?

30:37.069 --> 30:41.540
[camera shutter clicking]

30:41.573 --> 30:42.574
- OLIVIA.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.214
- I'M SORRY.

30:59.158 --> 31:02.929
- A SHARP BLADE TRANSECTED
THE EXTERIOR JUGULAR.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.664
BLOOD LOSS
WAS STEADY AND FATAL

31:05.697 --> 31:08.067
WITHOUT A PRESSURE BANDAGE
AND A FIELD SURGEON.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.902
- IS THERE ANYTHING
UNDER HER FINGERNAILS?

31:13.305 --> 31:14.974
- NOT THAT I CAN SEE.

31:15.007 --> 31:16.142
- WELL, CHECK
THE OTHER HAND.

31:16.175 --> 31:20.212
- I WILL WHEN I GET HER
ON MY TABLE.

31:26.585 --> 31:30.689
- MELINDA,
THIS PLACE IS TRASHED.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.092
SONYA FOUGHT BACK HARD,
AND SHE LOST,

31:33.125 --> 31:34.193
BUT SHE GOT HIM.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.263
IT'S THE LAST THING
THAT SHE SAID.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.365
- HE GRABBED HER
FROM BEHIND,

31:39.398 --> 31:42.134
WRAPPED HIS FOREARM
AROUND HER CHIN

31:42.168 --> 31:43.569
TO FREE HER NECK
FOR HIS BLADE.

31:43.602 --> 31:49.275
- BUT THE ATTACK DIDN'T GO
AS PLANNED.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.943
SHE WENT DOWN SWINGING,
AND HE LOST CONTROL.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.012
- SHE'D BE WEAK
FROM AIR LOSS, LIV.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.081
- THEN SHE BIT HIM.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.218
SONYA KNEW
THAT SHE WAS GONNA DIE,

31:59.251 --> 32:02.088
SO SHE WENT FOR HIS DNA.
IT'S WHAT I'D DO.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.633
- THERE'S A HAIR
IN HER THROAT.

32:14.666 --> 32:18.370
I'LL SWAB HER MOUTH AND CHECK
HER STOMACH FOR HIS BLOOD.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.650
- I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE BACK.

32:38.024 --> 32:40.292
- I SHOULD'VE
COME BACK SOONER.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.494
- I'M FINE.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.496
- YEAH?

32:46.532 --> 32:48.167
LIKE HELL YOU ARE.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.770
- DID YOU CHECK
THE SECURITY LOGS

32:51.803 --> 32:53.239
FROM HARDING'S OFFICE?

32:53.272 --> 32:56.408
- THAT'S WHY IT TOOK ME
SO LONG TO GET HERE.

32:56.442 --> 32:59.011
I CHECKED ON EVERY MALE
WHO SIGNED IN

32:59.045 --> 33:00.279
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.613
ONE NAME RANG A BELL.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.714
- WHOSE?

33:02.748 --> 33:04.783
- DAVID ADAMS,
BUT HE DOESN'T EXIST.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.519
- SO WHO WAS THE GHOST
THERE TO SEE?

33:07.553 --> 33:10.722
- ALICIA HARDING'S ASSISTANT,

33:10.756 --> 33:12.358
RACHEL GRAY.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.211
- YOU'RE WRONG.

33:32.244 --> 33:33.412
DAVID'S A GOOD GUY.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.147
WE'VE BEEN SEEING
EACH OTHER FOR MONTHS.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.549
- MEANING YOU DIDN'T SIGN HIM IN
ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?

33:37.583 --> 33:39.385
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

33:39.418 --> 33:40.552
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.154
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.056
- RACHEL, DAVID IS A CON MAN.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.591
- YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.426
DAVID WOULDN'T HURT ANYBODY.
I KNOW HIM.

33:47.459 --> 33:50.562
- SO HE'S THE PERFECT GUY?

33:50.596 --> 33:52.531
I BET RIGHT NOW YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT ALL THE TIMES

33:52.564 --> 33:56.302
THAT HE ASKED ABOUT ALICIA.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.637
WAS HE TOO INTERESTED?

34:01.740 --> 34:03.842
DID HE USE YOU?
WAS ANY OF IT REAL?

34:03.875 --> 34:06.445
- I'M NOT A FOOL,
YOU KNOW.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.847
I CAN TELL
WHEN I'M BEING PLAYED.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.582
- SO MAYBE WE'RE WRONG.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.584
BUT ONLY DAVID
CAN STRAIGHTEN IT OUT,

34:12.618 --> 34:13.852
SO WHERE CAN WE FIND HIM?

34:13.885 --> 34:17.689
- HE LIVES DOWNTOWN.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.558
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

34:19.591 --> 34:20.592
HE'S ASHAMED OF HIS PLACE.

34:20.626 --> 34:21.760
I'LL TEXT YOU
THE ADDRESS.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.262
- WHAT'S HIS PHONE NUMBER?

34:23.295 --> 34:24.596
- HE DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.132
I OFFERED TO GET HIM ONE,

34:26.165 --> 34:27.533
BUT HE WAS TOO PROUD
TO TAKE IT.

34:27.566 --> 34:28.834
I LIKED THAT.

34:28.867 --> 34:31.203
- SO HOW DO YOU GET
IN TOUCH WITH HIM?

34:31.237 --> 34:32.338
- HE CALLS ME.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.274
HE CHECKS IN EVERY DAY.

34:35.307 --> 34:37.209
- OKAY.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.282
- THINK SHE'S
GONNA CALL HIM?

34:43.315 --> 34:44.750
- SHE'S IN LOVE
WITH THE SICK BASTARD.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.152
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

34:48.754 --> 34:50.189
I SET UP A TRACE
ON THE OFFICE LINES

34:50.222 --> 34:51.423
AND RACHEL'S CELL.

34:51.457 --> 34:53.159
SHE CALLS THE HUMP,
WE GOT HIM.

34:53.192 --> 34:57.129
- ALL RIGHT,
SHE'S DIALING OUT NOW.

34:57.163 --> 34:58.864
LOOKS LIKE
HE'S USING A BURN PHONE.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.169
- GOT IT.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.437
ADAMS IS UPTOWN
NEAR RIVERSIDE,

35:05.471 --> 35:08.374
A COUPLE OF BLOCKS AWAY
FROM HARDING'S PLACE.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.409
- PAT HER DOWN
AND SEND HER OUT.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.810
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

35:11.843 --> 35:13.545
- WELL, WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT ADAMS LOOKS LIKE

35:13.579 --> 35:14.780
WE GOTTA SMOKE HIM OUT
SOMEHOW.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.449
- WE EVEN SURE THAT HE'S GONNA
COME AFTER HER?

35:17.483 --> 35:19.285
- HE KNOWS ATTACKING SONYA
WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.220
I THINK HE'S RATTLED ENOUGH
TO MAKE ANOTHER.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.355
- SO WHAT'S HIS END GAME--
SUICIDE BY COP?

35:23.389 --> 35:25.757
- I BET HE DREAMS ABOUT TAKING
SOME OF US WITH HIM.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.660
- HE ALREADY DID,
AND SHE'S ALL HE'S GONNA GET.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.309
- MURDERING BASTARD!

35:43.342 --> 35:45.677
- ALICIA, NO! NO!

35:45.711 --> 35:47.145
- SHOOT HIM!

35:48.847 --> 35:51.383
- POLICE! DROP THE KNIFE!
LET HER GO!

35:51.417 --> 35:52.418
- BACK UP!

35:52.451 --> 35:53.452
I'M IN CONTROL HERE!

35:53.485 --> 35:54.820
- ADAMS,
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.688
THIS LOOK LIKE CONTROL
TO YOU?

35:56.722 --> 35:58.424
- YOU GOT A HEAD SHOT!
TAKE IT!

35:58.457 --> 36:00.326
- SHUT UP!

36:01.560 --> 36:03.795
ANYTHING?
- NOT YET.

36:03.829 --> 36:04.763
- THEY WANT
TO TAKE YOU ALIVE.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.832
STICK YOU IN A CAGE.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

36:06.865 --> 36:07.866
- STOP BAITING HIM!

36:07.899 --> 36:09.568
- HUH?

36:09.601 --> 36:11.303
[TASER buzzing]

36:11.337 --> 36:13.171
- [groaning]

36:20.812 --> 36:24.483
- ADAM GRAFTON, 43,
PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.951
HE LIVED EIGHT BLOCKS AWAY
FROM THE HARDINGS.

36:25.984 --> 36:27.919
HE DID A FIVE-YEAR STRETCH
IN LORTON

36:27.953 --> 36:29.488
FOR RAPE
AND AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.789
- HOW'D HE GET SUCH
A LIGHT SENTENCE?

36:30.822 --> 36:32.358
- WE'RE LUCKY
HE GOT ANYTHING AT ALL.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.659
VICTIM WAS A PROSTITUTE.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.494
HE BEAT HER
NEARLY TO DEATH.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.429
- PROBABLY WHY WE DON'T HAVE
ANY I.D.s ON OUR JANE DOES.

36:37.463 --> 36:38.697
THEY MUST'VE
BEEN WORKING GIRLS.

36:38.730 --> 36:41.833
- HE'S NOT GONNA TO TELL US
ANYTHING.

36:41.867 --> 36:45.404
- MAYBE HE'LL
TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.574
YOU MOVING?

36:48.607 --> 36:50.509
- I CAN'T STAY HERE.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.912
THAT SCUM WAS IN MY BED,
TOUCHING HIMSELF.

36:53.945 --> 36:58.584
- WELL, MAKE SURE
YOU BURN THE MATTRESS.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.286
YOU GIVING UP?

37:02.754 --> 37:03.989
- THE KILLER'S CAUGHT.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.123
NOTHING LEFT TO DO.

37:05.156 --> 37:08.794
- WELL, WE STILL NEED
TO IDENTIFY GRAFTON'S VICTIMS.

37:08.827 --> 37:13.999
- WELL, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.634
- THOUGHT YOU HAD A MISSION.

37:17.369 --> 37:20.939
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
THE STOMACH FOR IT ANYMORE.

37:20.972 --> 37:25.677
25 YEARS OF LOOKING
FOR THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE,

37:25.711 --> 37:29.548
AND HE GETS
A GYM MEMBERSHIP

37:29.581 --> 37:32.551
AND CABLE,

37:32.584 --> 37:35.454
WHILE HIS VICTIMS ROT
IN THE GROUND

37:35.487 --> 37:37.756
OR BLEED OUT
ON A BATHROOM FLOOR?

37:37.789 --> 37:40.025
- ALICIA...

37:40.058 --> 37:41.993
I NEED YOUR HELP.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.763
YOU KNOW THAT HE WON'T TALK
TO ANYONE BUT YOU.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.264
- NO, THANKS.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.804
- WELL, AT LEAST
YOU HAVE CLOSURE.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.640
GOD KNOWS
HIS VICTIMS DON'T.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.909
- I WILL NOT HAVE CLOSURE

37:57.943 --> 38:00.579
UNTIL I BRING
VANESSA'S REMAINS HOME.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.681
AND YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

38:02.714 --> 38:04.516
THAT HE IS NEVER GONNA TELL ME
WHERE SHE IS.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.486
- PROBABLY NOT
FOR A VERY LONG TIME, IF EVER.

38:08.887 --> 38:15.394
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILIES
WITH MISSING DAUGHTERS?

38:15.427 --> 38:17.396
OR DID YOU ALREADY FORGET
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE?

38:17.429 --> 38:18.964
- [laughs]

38:23.969 --> 38:28.073
HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU
YOU'RE A MANIPULATIVE BITCH?

38:33.078 --> 38:35.414
- WHEN I BONED
YOUR FAT ASSISTANT,

38:35.447 --> 38:37.082
I'D PRETEND SHE WAS YOU.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.717
ONLY WAY I COULD GET OFF.

38:38.750 --> 38:39.885
- WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?

38:39.918 --> 38:42.421
WE ALL KNOW
THAT YOU DIDN'T TOUCH HER.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.955
YOU LIKE YOUR WOMEN DEAD.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.691
- LEAVE.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.859
THIS IS BETWEEN ME AND HER.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.695
- IF SHE GOES, SO DO I.

38:49.728 --> 38:50.996
- THEN BEND OVER,

38:51.029 --> 38:52.964
'CAUSE I GOT NOTHING TO SAY.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.801
- I CAN DO THE NEWS SEGMENT
WITHOUT YOU,

38:55.834 --> 38:59.705
BUT I'M HERE BECAUSE I'D LIKE
TO HEAR YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY.

38:59.738 --> 39:00.739
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

39:00.772 --> 39:03.409
YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

39:03.442 --> 39:06.545
- MY SISTER'S DEAD.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.113
YOU KILLED HER.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.482
- AND YOU PLANTED THE CLOTHES
SO YOU COULD FIND THEM LATER.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.117
- SO WHAT IF I DID?

39:12.150 --> 39:15.654
DOESN'T MEAN I KILLED HER.
HMM?

39:15.687 --> 39:16.922
MAYBE VANESSA'S
NOT EVEN DEAD.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.824
MAYBE SHE JUST RAN AWAY.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.459
- YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT INTERESTED, GRAFTON.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.927
I WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THE SIX WOMEN

39:21.960 --> 39:23.695
YOU DUMPED IN THAT FIELD.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.564
WHERE DID YOU MEET THEM?

39:36.575 --> 39:38.744
- YOU USUALLY WORK
WITH A CAMERA CREW.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.980
- AFTER I HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE
TO SAY AND THEN CHECK MY FACTS.

39:42.013 --> 39:47.453
PLUS, YOU NEED A SHAVE.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.455
- [laughs]

39:49.488 --> 39:50.756
THIS IS REAL?

39:50.789 --> 39:53.959
I GIVE YOU NAMES,

39:53.992 --> 39:56.027
DATES, AND LOCATIONS,

39:56.061 --> 39:57.929
AND THEN YOU TELL MY STORY.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.698
- IF YOU COOPERATE,

39:59.731 --> 40:02.400
AND IF YOU TELL US
THE TRUTH.

40:03.869 --> 40:07.473
- THIS COULD TAKE A WHILE.

40:07.506 --> 40:10.075
THERE'S ONE FOR EACH YEAR
I'VE BEEN LIVING.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.646
TOOK THEM IN CLUMPS.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.449
SOME YEARS
I DIDN'T EVEN HUNT AT ALL.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.154
- YOU KILLED 43 WOMEN?

40:23.188 --> 40:24.990
- 44 IF YOU COUNT
THE LAWYER.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.494
MEAT SACK WAS ASKING FOR IT.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.562
- BECAUSE SHE BEAT YOU,
GRAFTON.

40:30.596 --> 40:34.165
SONYA PAXTON IS THE REASON THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DEATH ROW.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.768
- I'LL DIE
OF OLD AGE FIRST.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.504
ONLY REASON I DID HER

40:38.537 --> 40:41.507
IS BECAUSE ALICIA
TOLD LIES,

40:41.540 --> 40:43.174
AND SHE HAD TO PAY.

40:45.143 --> 40:49.648
- LET'S START WITH THE NAMES
OF YOUR NEW YORK VICTIMS,

40:49.681 --> 40:54.986
AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON
TO YOUR MARYLAND DUMPING GROUND.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.555
- SO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

40:56.588 --> 40:59.558
- AND I'D LIKE
TO KNOW MORE,

40:59.591 --> 41:00.892
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.971
- MOSTLY GIRLS,

41:13.004 --> 41:14.673
RUNAWAYS,

41:14.706 --> 41:15.941
A COUPLE I SNATCHED.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.744
NONE OF 'EM PUT UP
MUCH OF A FIGHT, THOUGH.

41:20.546 --> 41:22.848
SO YOU WANT ME TO GO
IN ORDER,

41:22.881 --> 41:25.717
LIST THEM
FROM FRONT TO LAST?

41:29.020 --> 41:31.823
HER NAME WAS ANNIE PRUITT.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.626
GOD, SHE WAS SWEET.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.562
PICKED HER UP IN DUNDALK

41:36.595 --> 41:38.530
AND TOOK HER
FOR THE RIDE OF HER LIFE...

41:38.564 --> 41:40.566
