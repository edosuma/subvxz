so it did.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.040
Oh! Isn't she gorgeous?

00:40.040 --> 00:42.440
Give me strength.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.160
Everyone's looking at us!

00:54.200 --> 00:55.880
Do you think it's your hat? What?

00:55.920 --> 00:58.720
It is a bit much, Mary. I did try to
tell you.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.480
My hat's a bit much? Really?

01:00.520 --> 01:02.720
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.720
What in under Christ have you
done now?

01:04.760 --> 01:06.560
I don't think she was talking
to me, Joe.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.760
I think she was talking to the
person in the full-length

01:08.800 --> 01:11.000
white frock who just managed to
upstage the actual bride.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.640
Och, I wouldn't say I upstaged her
now, Gerry.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.240
It's so mortifying.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.080
Well, take it off then, Mary.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.120
What?

01:18.160 --> 01:19.600
The hat.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.520
Ah, shite.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.680
There you are. He's spied us.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.800
Run, girls. Save yourselves.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.080
John over there was just saying...
You know John?

01:29.120 --> 01:32.640
Lovely fella. Married to, er,
Patricia, I think it is,

01:32.680 --> 01:36.200
and her mother worked in the credit
union, you might remember.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.400
Absolutely crippled with the old
gallstones, so she was.

01:39.440 --> 01:40.640
Christ Almighty.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.080
And the gallstones... Well, now,
they're no joke.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.880
A neighbour of mine, Dickie
Dunnagan, by God,

01:45.920 --> 01:47.840
he was tortured with the gallstones.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.960
The size of golf balls they were.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.800
And what did John say, Colm? For the
love of God, what did he say?

01:52.840 --> 01:54.760
He was telling me there, John was,

01:54.800 --> 01:57.880
that every being in the place is
talking about Sarah's frock.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.360
Och, really?

01:59.400 --> 02:01.560
Jesus, but this is an ordeal.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.800
Well, at least they got a good day
for it, Mary.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.040
I'll tell you, I was at one there,
up in the Cathedral last week.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.479
By God,

02:08.520 --> 02:12.960
the wind could have cut you in two.
Fierce it was, and now I don't mind

02:13.000 --> 02:16.040
a bit of a breeze.
If anything, I prefer it.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.560
But thon was aggressive.

02:17.600 --> 02:22.360
And I says to myself, says I, "Colm,
this is no day for a do."

02:22.400 --> 02:23.560
And as it turns out...

02:23.600 --> 02:25.400
Can I just stop you there, Colm?

02:25.440 --> 02:27.720
Surely, Mary. Go ahead. Oh, no, I've
got nothing to say.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.120
I just really, really need you to
stop talking.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.440
Fair enough.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.720
Herself's over there.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.520
Circling the drinks table.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.120
Bitter old bat. Da...

02:36.160 --> 02:37.640
It's one glass per head.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.560
She has already necked the guts of
four bottles.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.440
Da! Though it'll hardly touch the
sides.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.960
Tolerance of a rhino.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.240
Stop it, OK? Bridie's still our
aunt.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.800
She's still Mammy's sister.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.200
And if Mammy was alive...

02:48.240 --> 02:49.520
Your mother couldn't stick her!

02:49.560 --> 02:51.600
Sh! She's coming over.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.680
Auntie Bridie, great to see you!

02:53.720 --> 02:55.640
Well, you should be proud of
yourself.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.280
Och, thanks very much.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.640
All right, Bridie. Are you well?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.160
Nope. No, I'm not, actually.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.280
Not that you give a shit.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.360
Mammy hasn't been keeping the best
lately, Joe.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.280
I was a bit worried about her for a
while.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.400
I wouldn't upset yourself too much,
son.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.320
Sure a bullet couldn't take your
mother out.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.840
Isn't that right, Bridie?

03:12.880 --> 03:14.440
Still a prick I see, Joe.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.400
Christ knows what our Marie ever saw
in you,

03:16.440 --> 03:17.920

03:17.960 --> 03:20.600
Yous must still miss her terribly,
girls. We do indeed.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.760
Isn't it a crying shame neither of
you got her looks?

03:22.800 --> 03:23.960
OK.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.520
So, Eamonn! Any craic with you?
Are you seeing anyone?

03:27.560 --> 03:29.480
Should I maybe buy myself
another hat?

03:29.520 --> 03:32.960
You should definitely buy yourself
another hat, Mary. That thing does
nothing for you.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.400
I'm not seeing anyone. Plenty of
time, I suppose.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.840
Eamonn'll never marry.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.160
Is that a feeling, Bridie, or an
instruction?

03:41.240 --> 03:43.840

Macca!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.440
That's not helping, Michelle!

Macca. Tall fella, dark hair,

04:41.760 --> 04:44.240
wonky nose from when he used to do
the bare-knuckle boxing.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.960
Look, he's loads of tattoos, big
scar under his left eye.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.120
He was kicked out of Creggan for
joyriding!

04:49.160 --> 04:51.080
Well, he sounds delightful!
He really does.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.480

09:07.720 --> 09:08.720
Cause her death?

09:08.760 --> 09:10.360
..coincide with her death.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.960
Right, well, that's the dishes done.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.520
Would you like another cup of tea
there, Mammy? No, I'm fine.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.280
I'll just grab the Hoover and give
the stairs a bit of a going over.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.320
And I'll maybe do a bit of dusting.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.320
What's got into you two? What are
you up to? What do you want?
