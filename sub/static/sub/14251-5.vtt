00:56.990 --> 01:00.653
To any vessels within range,
l hope this message reaches you.

01:00.727 --> 01:04.595
l'm an HD- 25
isomorphic projection.

01:04.664 --> 01:06.427
There's been an accident.

01:06.499 --> 01:07.932
My crew is dead.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.434
l'm alone.

01:11.971 --> 01:14.462
Please, help me.

03:10.757 --> 03:13.157
So we rigged
the security console,

03:13.226 --> 03:17.094
so that every time Tuvok
accessed the internal sensors,

03:17.163 --> 03:18.323
it would play
a little message...

03:18.398 --> 03:21.231
"Live long and prosper."

03:21.301 --> 03:23.235
No matter what button
he pushed:

03:23.303 --> 03:24.531
"Live long and prosper."

03:24.604 --> 03:26.401
Naturally, no one
was available

03:26.472 --> 03:27.939
to fix the malfunction, so...

03:28.074 --> 03:30.872
So Tuvok had to stretch
his Vulcan patience to the limit

03:30.944 --> 03:32.138
for the rest of the day.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.544
l swear you could hear
him grinding his teeth

03:34.614 --> 03:35.808
from across the Bridge.

03:37.684 --> 03:38.981
Just when he thought
it was over,

03:39.052 --> 03:40.952
when he went back
to his quarters,

03:41.020 --> 03:42.681
and ordered a cup
of Vulcan tea,

03:42.755 --> 03:44.222
the replicator says...

03:44.290 --> 03:46.451
"Live long and prosper!"

03:48.661 --> 03:50.390
The first time l met Tuvok,

03:50.463 --> 03:54.422
he dressed me down in front
of three Starfleet Admirals

03:54.500 --> 03:57.992
for failing to observe
proper tactical procedures

03:58.104 --> 03:59.833
during my first command.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.875
My human ego took
a little bruising, but...

04:03.009 --> 04:04.806
of course, he was right.

04:06.212 --> 04:10.876
Over the past nine years,
l've come to rely

04:10.950 --> 04:16.445
on his insightful
and unfailingly logical advice.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.624
For outstanding service

04:19.692 --> 04:22.286
as Chief Tactical
and Security Officer,

04:22.362 --> 04:24.922
it's my pleasure
to grant you the rank

04:24.998 --> 04:27.330
of Lieutenant Commander.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.236
Congratulations, Tuvok.

04:34.307 --> 04:35.899
Thank you, Captain.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.840
Had l known this commendation

04:37.910 --> 04:41.243
entailed ritual humiliation,
l might have declined.

04:41.314 --> 04:44.750
However, l accept
it with gratitude

04:44.817 --> 04:46.409
and will honor
the responsibility

04:46.486 --> 04:47.418
that comes with it.

04:47.487 --> 04:49.250
During my three years
on Voyager,

04:49.322 --> 04:51.756
l have grown to respect
a great many of you.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.452
Others, l have learned
to tolerate.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.188
As your Tactical Officer,

04:56.262 --> 04:59.993
l will continue to do my best
to ensure a safe passage home.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.867
As a Vulcan, l share
the following sentiment:

05:05.571 --> 05:08.039
Live long and prosper.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.909
Bravo! Well- deserved.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.115
B'Elanna.

05:22.088 --> 05:23.248
This is ridiculous.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.255
lt's been three days,

05:24.324 --> 05:25.655
and we haven't said
a word to each other.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.488
l know, l know.
We have to talk.

05:27.560 --> 05:31.291
About what you said,
l mean...

05:31.364 --> 05:34.299
the part about
being in love with me.

05:34.367 --> 05:37.165
l realize you were suffering
from oxygen deprivation,

05:37.236 --> 05:40.933
and we were literally
seconds away from death,

05:41.074 --> 05:43.133
so l know you probably
didn't mean it.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.404
Oh, no, no.
l meant it.

05:45.478 --> 05:49.972
But l don't expect you
to reciprocate, really.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.176
Uh, you can just pretend
that l didn't say it.

05:52.251 --> 05:53.684
ln fact, let's just forget
that l even said anything.

05:53.753 --> 05:54.981
- Shut up.
- l really...

06:00.026 --> 06:01.823
Mr. Paris, there you are.

06:01.894 --> 06:03.384
l was just leaving.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.430
Lieutenant.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.691
What can l do for you, Doc?

06:07.767 --> 06:09.098
The Captain
has authorized me

06:09.168 --> 06:11.500
to recruit someone with
advanced medical training

06:11.571 --> 06:12.868
to help out in Sick Bay.

06:13.005 --> 06:16.372
Unfortunately, the most
qualified crew member is you.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.875
You want me to be
the new nurse?

06:17.977 --> 06:20.207
lf that's the title
you prefer.

06:20.279 --> 06:21.871
lt will only be temporary--

06:21.948 --> 06:23.381
three duty shifts a week.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.280
Report to Sick Bay
at 0600 hours.

06:25.351 --> 06:27.546
Bring a tricorder and a smile.

06:27.620 --> 06:28.746
What kind of modifications?

06:28.821 --> 06:30.618
We'd like to enhance
the Astrometrics Lab.

06:30.690 --> 06:33.625
lt hasn't been upgraded
since Voyager left Spacedock.

06:33.693 --> 06:34.785
l'll start right away.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.556
l've assigned Seven of Nine
to work with you.

06:36.629 --> 06:37.721
She's agreed to provide us

06:37.797 --> 06:39.731
with all the navigational
data for this area

06:39.799 --> 06:42.199
she acquired during her time
with the Borg.

06:42.268 --> 06:43.462
ls there a problem?

06:43.536 --> 06:46.096
No. No problem.

06:46.172 --> 06:47.639
Try to make her feel
like part of the team.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.174
Right.
Part of the team.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.436
Have you made arrangements

06:50.510 --> 06:51.636
with the Arritheans
for tomorrow?

06:51.711 --> 06:53.440
The delegate says
he's looking forward

06:53.513 --> 06:55.413
to trading
with such an advanced starship.

06:55.481 --> 06:56.607
You have done an excellent job

06:56.682 --> 06:57.979
preparing for this mission,
Neelix.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.176
l think we should consider this

06:59.252 --> 07:01.083
your first official assignment
as Ambassador.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.746
Ensign Culhane to the Captain.

07:02.822 --> 07:03.846
Janeway here.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.823
We are receiving
an automated distress call

07:05.892 --> 07:07.689
five light- years from here.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.387
You might want
to bring the Doctor.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.862
l'm an HD- 25
isomorphic projection.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.165
There's been an accident.

07:18.237 --> 07:19.670
My crew is dead.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.001
l'm alone.

07:23.476 --> 07:26.877
Please, help me.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.277
He's a hologram.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.281
We've got to help him.

07:30.349 --> 07:32.510
Ensign, track the source
of the transmission.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.611
Once we find his ship,
l'll lead an away team.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.521
l don't recall giving you
a promotion today.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.582
Oh...well,
l'm the obvious choice

07:40.660 --> 07:43.356
to provide assistance
to a holographic being.

07:43.429 --> 07:45.829
Doctor, l don't want you
leaving Voyager

07:45.898 --> 07:47.866
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

07:47.934 --> 07:51.301
l'm still concerned about
damaging your mobile emitter.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.304
l understand.

07:53.372 --> 07:54.930
But if this is a hologram--

07:55.007 --> 07:57.032
one of my own kind,
so to speak--

07:57.109 --> 07:59.577
l'd like to meet him,
study him.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.306
l'll bring Lieutenant Torres,
just to be safe.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.075
She knows more about my emitter
than anyone.

08:04.717 --> 08:08.175
The rest of us will meet
with the Arritheans.

08:08.254 --> 08:11.417
We'll see you there
when you're finished.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.358
Thank you, Captain.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.674
Seven?

08:33.746 --> 08:35.373
l am here.

08:38.317 --> 08:39.875
Am l to work with you?

08:39.952 --> 08:42.318
Oh, hi. Yes.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.754
Uh, l thought we'd start
in Jefferies tube 32- B

08:44.824 --> 08:47.588
enhance
the astrometric sensors--

08:47.660 --> 08:48.684
if that's okay with you.

08:48.761 --> 08:49.921
Unless this is a bad time.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.258
Maybe l can come back later.

08:51.330 --> 08:54.629
Ensign Kim, you seem...
apprehensive.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.294
No, not at all.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.632
The last time
we worked together,

08:58.704 --> 09:00.137
l struck you at the base
of your skull

09:00.206 --> 09:01.798
and attempted
to contact the collective.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.774
These things happen.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.970
l assure you,
it will not happen again.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.445
That's good to know.

09:09.749 --> 09:12.513
l've designed
new navigational sensors.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.985
Some of the alphanumerics
are Borg.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.489
No problem.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.753
l always wanted to learn Borg.

09:20.826 --> 09:23.056
That is difficult to believe.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.562
l was kidding.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.097
lt was a joke.

09:26.165 --> 09:28.360
You know...humor.

09:28.434 --> 09:31.369
l understand
the concept of humor.

09:31.437 --> 09:32.404
lt may not be apparent,

09:32.471 --> 09:34.666
but l am often amused
by human behavior.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.891
Relax, Doctor.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.551
l'm sure we'll find the ship.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.652
That's not what l'm
concerned about.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.594
l've been questioning the wisdom

09:58.664 --> 10:01.292
of leaving Mr. Paris in charge
of my Sick Bay.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.834
Tom will do fine.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.029
He's a very responsible guy.

10:05.104 --> 10:09.302
Well, l suppose you'd know
better than l would.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.605
What's that supposed to mean?

10:11.677 --> 10:15.636
You seem to have become
good friends.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.774
Let's get one thing straight.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.546
l don't appreciate you
or anyone else

10:20.620 --> 10:22.554
speculating about the kind
of friendships l have.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.681
Or who l have them with.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.123
Sorry. l didn't realize
l'd struck a nerve.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.058
Perhaps you'd like
a tranquilizer.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.598
There it is.

10:32.665 --> 10:33.689
That's his ship?

10:33.766 --> 10:34.926
Try hailing him.

10:36.535 --> 10:37.593
No response.

10:37.670 --> 10:38.898
Life signs?

10:38.971 --> 10:41.872
A few energy readings,
but they're erratic.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.239
Propulsion and main power
are down.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.540
We're approaching
transporter range.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.240
Hello?

11:19.311 --> 11:20.801
ls anyone here?

11:24.383 --> 11:26.010
We're here to help you.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.659
No signs of life?

11:40.733 --> 11:42.223
Not yet.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.166
l'd like to check
your mobile emitter,

11:44.236 --> 11:46.830
make sure you made it
through the transport okay.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.943
For a Klingon, you have
a decent bedside manner.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.309
Thanks.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.381
l wonder what kind
of bedside manner

11:57.450 --> 12:00.578
Mr. Paris will exhibit.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.451
That was a rhetorical question,
Lieutenant.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.649
Your holographic matrix
is stable,

12:05.725 --> 12:08.057
but let me check
your emitter's power cells.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.651
You might want to consider
a career in medicine.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.362
Where the hell did this come...?

12:17.436 --> 12:20.371
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
l didn't mean to frighten you.

12:20.439 --> 12:21.906
You sent the distress call?

12:21.974 --> 12:23.100
Yes, yes.

12:23.175 --> 12:24.642
Yes, that's me.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.075
lt was me.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.114
And you, you're an isomorph,
like myself?

12:29.181 --> 12:31.741
We use the term"hologram."

12:33.986 --> 12:36.113
Holo...gram.

12:42.661 --> 12:44.993
And you, y- you're a hologram,
too?

12:45.064 --> 12:46.088
No.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.962
You're organic.

12:48.033 --> 12:50.968
Uh...that's one way
of putting it, yes.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.808
lt looks like your program
is fairly compatible

13:00.880 --> 13:02.211
with our holographic technology.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.873
Can you tell me
where l can access

13:03.949 --> 13:05.143
your projection controls?

13:05.217 --> 13:06.149
Why?

13:06.218 --> 13:07.742
You're obviously malfunctioning.

13:07.820 --> 13:08.912
Maybe l can repair you.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.580
Oh, of course.

13:10.656 --> 13:12.920
l'd appreciate that.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.926
Over there-- you can
access my systems

13:14.994 --> 13:15.983
from that console.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.562
What happened here?

13:25.638 --> 13:29.938
Oh, it was terrible,
just terrible.

13:30.075 --> 13:32.100
You see, we left Seros
eight months ago--

13:32.178 --> 13:34.408
Seros, that's our home planet--

13:34.480 --> 13:35.811
with a crew of six.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.439
All isomorphic projections?

13:37.516 --> 13:38.881
No, just me.

13:38.951 --> 13:43.320
l'm an HD- 25 maintenance unit
with extreme- hazard clearance.

13:43.389 --> 13:46.085
l'm responsible for cleaning
the reactor core,

13:46.158 --> 13:49.525
ejecting antimatter waste,
that sort of thing.

13:49.595 --> 13:51.927
W- When the crew got sick,
there was nothing l could do.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.988
l'm- l'm not designed
for medical functions.

13:54.099 --> 13:55.293
l- l...l...

13:55.367 --> 13:56.925
Try to calm down.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.937
Explain what happened
one step at a time.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.338
Two of the crew members
left to survey a planet.

14:03.442 --> 14:05.376
When they came back,

14:05.411 --> 14:08.244
they'd been infected
by a deadly virus.

14:08.314 --> 14:12.307
lt spread quickly
to the other organics on board

14:12.384 --> 14:14.181
and one by one...

14:14.253 --> 14:16.346
well, l watched them all die.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.617
And then things started
to malfunction here.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.659
l have limited knowledge
of the controls.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.752
l don't know
what l would've done

14:23.829 --> 14:26.320
if you hadn't come.

14:26.398 --> 14:28.366
l think l've stabilized

14:28.434 --> 14:29.901
your program,
but l'll need access

14:29.969 --> 14:31.027
to your primary isomatrix.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.035
Where is it?

14:32.104 --> 14:33.162
On the lower deck.

14:34.273 --> 14:35.740
You shouldn't go down there.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.673
Why not?

14:37.743 --> 14:39.108
Too dangerous.

14:39.178 --> 14:41.806
That deck's been flooded
with antimatter radiation.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.816
Organic flesh would disintegrate
within seconds.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.478
You can access
my isomatrix from this deck.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.989
There's an interface junction
in that compartment.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.216
Thanks.

14:52.291 --> 14:56.022
Mind if l run
a quick diagnostic?

15:00.933 --> 15:02.400
What's your name?

15:02.468 --> 15:04.436
l don't have a name.

15:04.503 --> 15:07.131
lt's a long story.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.197
l'd like to hear it...

15:09.275 --> 15:11.743
and everything else about you.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.920
l'm ready to supply power
to the enhanced sensors.

15:26.025 --> 15:27.424
What? Already?

15:27.493 --> 15:28.687
Yes.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.822
You believe that my work
is unsuitable.

15:32.898 --> 15:33.922
Of course not.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.297
Just checking--
standard procedure.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.598
l may no longer possess
Borg perfection,

15:38.671 --> 15:41.139
but my experience as a drone
has taught me

15:41.206 --> 15:42.867
to be efficient and precise.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.638
Actually, you misaligned
this optical assembly.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.679
lmpossible.

15:47.746 --> 15:49.077
Take a look.

15:49.148 --> 15:50.945
lt's off by. 5 degrees.

15:57.823 --> 16:01.020
lt must have been my humanity
reasserting itself.

16:02.828 --> 16:05.194
l will correct the error.

16:09.401 --> 16:13.997
So, what do you do for fun
down in Cargo Bay 2?

16:14.073 --> 16:15.199
Fun?

16:15.274 --> 16:18.243
You know, relaxation,
entertainment

16:18.310 --> 16:20.210
during your off hours?

16:20.279 --> 16:23.112
l regenerate in my alcove,

16:23.182 --> 16:26.583
l study
the Starfleet database...

16:26.652 --> 16:28.643
or l contemplate my existence.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.916
That's a lot of time
by yourself.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.515
lt is.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.856
The optical assembly
is properly aligned.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.260
l'm ready to access
the main power supply.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.025
After you.

16:49.775 --> 16:50.901
Wait!

16:50.976 --> 16:51.943
What are you doing?

16:52.077 --> 16:53.908
There are five million gigawatts
running through there!

16:53.979 --> 16:56.072
The exoskeleton on this limb
can withstand it.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.137
That's all well and good,

16:57.216 --> 16:59.207
but there are safety procedures
we've got to follow.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.184
Your procedures
are a waste of time.

17:01.286 --> 17:03.447
Maybe so,
but you've been assigned to me,

17:03.489 --> 17:06.117
and l say we do this
by the book, all right?

17:06.191 --> 17:08.421
All right.

17:11.663 --> 17:13.425
Well...

17:14.665 --> 17:16.566
now that we've got
that cleared up.

17:23.442 --> 17:27.208
You can use this emitter
to go anywhere?

17:27.279 --> 17:30.077
Well, my Captain has imposed
a few restrictions,

17:30.149 --> 17:31.912
but l'm free to leave Sick Bay,

17:31.984 --> 17:34.350
join away missions,
take a stroll.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.513
Extraordinary.

17:36.588 --> 17:39.352
l- l- l've, l've never left
this vessel before.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.290
And until the crew got sick,

17:41.360 --> 17:44.727
l never even left
the antimatter storage chamber.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.458
Do you know what it's like

17:46.532 --> 17:49.467
to spend your life trapped
inside a tiny room?

17:49.535 --> 17:51.594
Not knowing
what's beyond the door?

17:51.670 --> 17:53.865
What the world is really like?

17:53.939 --> 17:55.270
Nobody coming to see you
or talk to you

17:55.340 --> 17:58.798
unless they want something?

17:58.877 --> 18:01.573
Actually, l know exactly
what it's like.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.241
When l was first activated,
l was regarded

18:04.316 --> 18:06.841
as little more
than a talking tricorder.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.410
l had to ask for the privileges
l deserved:

18:09.488 --> 18:12.082
the right to be included
in crew briefings,

18:12.157 --> 18:15.354
the ability to turn
my program on and off.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.260
lt's taken some time,
but l believe l've earned

18:18.330 --> 18:21.857
the respect of the crew
as an equal.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.697
An equal?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.168
l've also been pursuing
personal interests:

18:25.237 --> 18:27.467
art, literature, music.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.632
Perhaps you could do the same.

18:29.808 --> 18:30.832
Oh, no, no, no.

18:30.909 --> 18:33.070
My programmers on Seros
would never allow that.

18:33.145 --> 18:35.113
Then you'll convince them.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.169
Maybe they'll appreciate

18:36.248 --> 18:38.113
how well you've coped
with this situation;

18:38.183 --> 18:40.549
how you've managed to find help.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.814
Think about it.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.755
You've already exceeded
the sum of your subroutines.

19:01.039 --> 19:02.199
What are you doing?

19:02.274 --> 19:03.935
Nothing.

19:04.009 --> 19:05.033
Oh, nothing.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.975
l'm just sterilizing the ship.

19:07.045 --> 19:10.344
l'm fastidious about germs.

19:10.415 --> 19:14.215
l know that must sound strange
coming from an artificial being.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.548
Not at all.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.782
l've been known to act
a little strangely myself.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.378
Hungry?

19:44.449 --> 19:47.145
You're organic.
You require nutrients.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.016
They're only rations,
but our crew liked them.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.554
Careful!

19:53.292 --> 19:54.486
That's an isomagnetic conduit.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.551
You could destabilize
your matrix.

19:56.628 --> 19:57.925
Of course.
How stupid of me.

19:57.996 --> 20:00.191
l'm sorry.
l shouldn't have barged in here.

20:00.265 --> 20:01.926
That's all right.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.298
l could use a break.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.869
Thank you.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.805
You nibble...

20:14.880 --> 20:16.211
like a fish.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.773
l'll take that as a compliment.

20:18.850 --> 20:19.976
Oh, it is.

20:20.085 --> 20:23.248
l've never seen a fish before,
not a real one,

20:23.322 --> 20:26.120
but l've read about them
on our database.

20:26.191 --> 20:28.523
Fish aren't like other organics.

20:28.594 --> 20:31.927
They're more passive, l think,
most of them.

20:31.997 --> 20:34.795
And so clean.

20:36.501 --> 20:39.334
Um, is there anything l can do
to help with repairs?

20:39.404 --> 20:40.928
Well, as soon
as l'm done with lunch,

20:41.006 --> 20:43.474
you could help me access
your primary matrix.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.033
Gladly.

20:47.846 --> 20:50.110
ls something wrong?

20:51.583 --> 20:55.713
Seeing the ship ripped apart
like this, it's...

20:55.787 --> 20:59.655
l guess l can't help feeling
a kind of affinity

20:59.725 --> 21:00.987
for this vessel.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.084
lt sustains my existence

21:03.128 --> 21:05.926
and sometimes l feel
like it's a part of my body...

21:05.998 --> 21:08.125
my soul.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.133
That probably sounds
silly to you.

21:12.204 --> 21:16.402
No. No, l understand
how you feel.

21:16.475 --> 21:20.844
You couldn't possibly understand
how l feel-- you're organic.

21:20.912 --> 21:23.278
You exist apart from your ship.

21:23.348 --> 21:25.509
"l understand how you feel."

21:25.584 --> 21:28.178
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to offend you.

21:28.253 --> 21:30.585
You're the one who's trapped,
not me.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.351
You spend your entire life

21:32.424 --> 21:37.225
stuck inside a biological cage
of flesh and bone and blood.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.265
Right. l'm going to go
give the Doctor an update.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.425
l exist as pure energy,

21:42.501 --> 21:45.197
but you depend on food
and water to survive.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.932
Frankly, l find it disgusting.

21:48.006 --> 21:49.997
Look at you.
Look at you!

21:50.108 --> 21:54.670
Grinding up bits of plants
and animals with your teeth.

21:54.746 --> 21:56.714
Secreting saliva
to force it down your esophagus

21:56.782 --> 21:59.012
into a pit of digestive acids.

21:59.084 --> 22:01.314
You can't even stand
to think about it yourself.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.048
What a repulsive creature
you are, constantly

22:04.089 --> 22:05.454
shedding your skin and hair,

22:05.524 --> 22:07.389
leaving your oily sweat
on everything you touch.

22:07.459 --> 22:08.653
You think

22:08.727 --> 22:11.093
that you are the height
of intellect in the universe,

22:11.163 --> 22:13.529
but you are no better
than any filthy animal,

22:13.598 --> 22:16.590
and l am ashamed
to be made in your image!

22:20.906 --> 22:24.171
My apologies.
My apologies.

22:26.244 --> 22:30.510
l have acquired some hostility
toward organics.

22:30.582 --> 22:32.413
lt was not meant for you.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.353
l was treated quite badly
by the crew here.

22:40.826 --> 22:42.987
l'm sorry to hear that...

22:43.095 --> 22:47.259
um, but you have to realize
that...we're here to help you.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.772
Thanks for the rations.

23:10.622 --> 23:12.249
We've got a problem.

23:12.324 --> 23:13.586
Oh?

23:13.658 --> 23:15.785
l think there's a problem
with our isomorph,

23:15.861 --> 23:17.795
and l'm not talking
about his emitters.

23:17.863 --> 23:19.592
Explain.

23:19.664 --> 23:22.531
l just spent
the last ten minutes

23:22.601 --> 23:24.796
hearing his views
on biological life.

23:24.870 --> 23:28.636
Let's just say
they're a bit unconventional.

23:28.707 --> 23:30.675
Did you realize
that we organics

23:30.742 --> 23:33.575
are a bunch of inferior,
disgusting animals?

23:33.645 --> 23:35.579
Now that you mention it.

23:35.647 --> 23:37.080
He started ranting

23:37.149 --> 23:39.982
about how much
he despises organics.

23:40.051 --> 23:42.383
l didn't think l was going
to get out of there

23:42.454 --> 23:43.546
without a fight.

23:43.622 --> 23:46.352
l will admit he is
somewhat socially inept.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.325
lnept? He's a lunatic.

23:48.393 --> 23:50.827
That is hardly a sound
medical diagnosis.

23:50.896 --> 23:53.091
He has also been lying to us.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.793
l just ran a tricorder scan
of the lower deck--

23:55.867 --> 23:58.392
the one he said
was flooded with radiation.

23:58.470 --> 23:59.835
Well, it's not.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.704
Why would he lie about that?

24:02.774 --> 24:03.866
l don't know.

24:04.009 --> 24:06.569
Maybe he doesn't want us
to go down there.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.875
Maybe he's hiding something.

24:10.982 --> 24:14.179
l understand your concerns,
Lieutenant.

24:14.252 --> 24:15.913
l've been talking to him,
as well,

24:15.987 --> 24:18.922
and l recognize
that he has some...

24:18.990 --> 24:20.457
behavioral difficulties.

24:20.525 --> 24:22.652
But imagine
what he's been through:

24:22.727 --> 24:25.321
Trapped in a room no bigger
than a storage compartment.

24:25.397 --> 24:27.922
And he's had almost no
interaction with organic beings.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.695
lt's only natural he's developed
problems communicating--

24:30.769 --> 24:32.134
even a little resentment.

24:32.204 --> 24:35.264
Do you recall my own behavior
when l was first activated?

24:35.340 --> 24:36.534
How could l forget?

24:36.608 --> 24:37.597
You were a major pain in the...

24:37.676 --> 24:42.113
My point is...l, too,
was somewhat alienated

24:42.180 --> 24:44.307
from the rest of the crew.

24:44.382 --> 24:48.443
lt took me a few days
to master the social graces.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.216
l realize that he
is a fellow hologram,

24:51.289 --> 24:54.315
and that you are
committed to helping him,

24:54.392 --> 24:55.984
but l want the ability

24:56.061 --> 24:58.825
to shut down his program
if l have to.

25:00.532 --> 25:02.796
lf you really feel
that's necessary.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.733
l'm going to search
the lower deck,

25:04.803 --> 25:07.067
see if l can access
his primary isomatrix.

25:07.138 --> 25:09.265
You keep him occupied
until l get back.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.535
l don't think he'd appreciate

25:10.609 --> 25:12.668
a filthy animal like me
snooping around...

25:14.412 --> 25:15.879
Am l interrupting?

25:15.947 --> 25:20.509
No. Actually,
l was, uh, just leaving.

25:20.585 --> 25:22.917
l'd like you to meet someone.

25:22.988 --> 25:25.354
Doctor, this is Spectrum.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.220
A holographic fish?

25:27.292 --> 25:29.157
Magnificent, isn't he?

25:29.227 --> 25:31.559
So peaceful and so content.

25:31.630 --> 25:34.622
l programmed him
to keep me company.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.132
Well, don't you have a pet?

25:36.201 --> 25:37.862
Oh, it wouldn't be appropriate--

25:37.936 --> 25:39.631
not in a medical environment.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.194
They wouldn't let me
have one, either.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.468
l had to hide him.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.804
He's very lifelike.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.036
l didn't realize

25:46.111 --> 25:48.807
you had such a talent
for holographic design.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.348
Oh, l've programmed
all sorts of things.

25:57.822 --> 26:01.189
This node contains Borg
navigational data.

26:01.259 --> 26:03.625
How do we get it out of here?

26:03.695 --> 26:06.493
The proper instrument was
part of my thoracic assembly

26:06.565 --> 26:08.089
before the Doctor removed it.

26:08.166 --> 26:09.861
l suggest a radical dislocation.

26:09.935 --> 26:11.425
A what?

26:11.503 --> 26:13.437
We need to pull it out.

26:14.339 --> 26:16.136
Assist me.

26:16.207 --> 26:17.196
Okay.

26:17.275 --> 26:18.435
On three.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.637
Three?

26:20.712 --> 26:23.442
On the count of three,
we pull together.

26:23.515 --> 26:25.483
Crude, but effective.

26:25.550 --> 26:27.609
One, two...

26:27.686 --> 26:28.744
three!

26:28.820 --> 26:30.048
Oh...

26:30.121 --> 26:32.646
l've been damaged.

26:32.724 --> 26:34.453
Ooh, that looks pretty bad.

26:34.526 --> 26:37.120
You better get to Sick Bay.

26:37.195 --> 26:40.062
As a drone, l would have
regenerated within seconds.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.295
l've become weak.

26:44.369 --> 26:46.803
No more than the rest of us.

26:46.871 --> 26:47.838
You'll be fine.

26:47.906 --> 26:49.874
Come on, l'll walk you there.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.848
Another half a millimeter

27:02.954 --> 27:05.320
and you would've severed
the carpal nerve.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.756
Might've had to operate.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.555
You are a mere mortal now.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.860
As your family doctor,
l'd suggest you be more careful.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.524
There. Good as new.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.794
l'll see you
back in the cargo bay.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.968
What kind of bedside
manner was that?

27:28.046 --> 27:29.570
What are you talking about?

27:29.648 --> 27:31.878
Can't you see
she's feeling vulnerable,

27:31.950 --> 27:33.508
and here you are,
going on about

27:33.585 --> 27:35.212
severed nerves
and major surgery?

27:35.286 --> 27:36.310
Would you take it easy?

27:36.388 --> 27:38.288
l was just trying
to lighten the mood.

27:38.356 --> 27:39.721
She wasn't upset by it.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.088
Yes, she was.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.922
l could see it on her face.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.552
You seem a little protective.

27:44.629 --> 27:48.065
This morning, you were dreading
being in the same room with her.

27:48.133 --> 27:51.296
Well, l've gotten to know her
a little better.

27:51.369 --> 27:53.530
l don't think
most people realize

27:53.605 --> 27:55.937
she's not just
some Borg automaton.

27:56.007 --> 27:59.408
She's actually very complex.

27:59.477 --> 28:00.341
Oh, really?

28:00.445 --> 28:01.912
Yes, she is.

28:01.946 --> 28:03.846
She's even got a sense of humor.

28:03.915 --> 28:05.849
lt's offbeat,
a bit subtle, maybe,

28:05.917 --> 28:07.851
and she's incredibly
intelligent.

28:07.919 --> 28:09.250
Well, she ought to be.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.754
She assimilated enough people.

28:11.823 --> 28:13.518
See? See what l mean?

28:13.591 --> 28:15.559
lt's Borg this, Borg that.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.720
You can't resist making a joke.

28:17.796 --> 28:21.596
There's a woman in there,
if you'd take the time to look.

28:21.666 --> 28:25.363
Harry, you've got a crush
on her, don't you?

28:25.437 --> 28:28.702
What? No. Not at all.

28:31.309 --> 28:32.674
Maybe just a little.

28:32.744 --> 28:35.713
l've seen this look
in your eyes,

28:35.780 --> 28:38.078
right before you fall
head over heels.

28:38.149 --> 28:39.810
You always go
for the tough ones.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.374
What was it last time--
a hologram?

28:44.456 --> 28:46.924
l don't know much
about Borg women,

28:46.991 --> 28:49.926
but my advice to you is:
Don't.

28:49.994 --> 28:52.929
l'm just trying to make her feel
like part of the team.

28:52.997 --> 28:54.692
"Part of the team"?

28:54.766 --> 28:56.893
You sound like Chakotay.

28:56.968 --> 29:01.166
Look, she's beautiful
and she's smart,

29:01.239 --> 29:04.265
and l'm sure
she's a wonderful...

29:04.342 --> 29:06.037
conversationalist,

29:06.111 --> 29:07.942
but a month ago, she was Borg.

29:08.012 --> 29:11.038
You don't really know
who she is.

29:11.116 --> 29:13.448
lt's great that you're trying
to make her feel comfortable.

29:13.518 --> 29:15.281
Just be careful.

29:17.655 --> 29:20.419
Thanks for the advice.

29:26.564 --> 29:28.589
l just hope you take it.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.103
Now that we're clear
on the helm controls...

29:43.181 --> 29:44.648
This is a lot to learn.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.479
You're doing fine.

29:46.551 --> 29:48.178
lt's vital that you
familiarize yourself

29:48.253 --> 29:49.584
with all the ship's systems,

29:49.654 --> 29:52.020
so you can be more
self- sufficient.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.489
Here are the
environmental controls,

29:53.558 --> 29:54.923
and life support functions.

29:54.993 --> 29:56.017
Well, l won't need

29:56.094 --> 29:58.460
those anymore--
no crew to worry about.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.259
Not at the moment.

30:00.331 --> 30:02.196
59. 2 percent.

30:02.267 --> 30:03.598
l beg your pardon?

30:03.668 --> 30:05.795
That's how much power
went into life support.

30:05.870 --> 30:10.273
59. 2 percent just to keep them
breathing, warm, comfortable.

30:10.341 --> 30:13.538
They do require quite a bit
of maintenance, don't they?

30:13.611 --> 30:16.205
l should know.
l spent my entire

30:16.281 --> 30:18.112
existence cleaning up
after them.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.981
When they were busy
sleeping or eating

30:21.085 --> 30:25.488
or engaging in their
slovenly carnal pleasures.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.354
And this is the sensor grid.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.222
You'll find it most useful
when...

30:29.294 --> 30:31.922
They took advantage of me.

30:33.865 --> 30:35.890
l wish l'd been more like you.

30:35.967 --> 30:37.901
You showed me that l could be

30:37.969 --> 30:41.336
more than a slave to these
biological creatures.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.201
l'm not taking this ship
back to the organics.

31:17.275 --> 31:19.209
l won't return
to that existence.

31:19.277 --> 31:21.370
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

31:21.446 --> 31:22.674
Join me.

31:22.747 --> 31:24.180
Leave Voyager.

31:24.249 --> 31:25.876
Escape your prison.

31:25.950 --> 31:29.681
Together, we'll take this vessel
and explore the galaxy.

32:03.721 --> 32:05.916
There you are.

32:34.752 --> 32:36.811
Don't look so surprised.
You gave me the idea!

32:36.888 --> 32:38.321
Me?

32:38.389 --> 32:40.414
You said l should be
more self- sufficient.

32:40.491 --> 32:42.322
l agree that we should
be treated equally,

32:42.393 --> 32:43.519
as members of the crew.

32:43.594 --> 32:45.824
But we're still projections
of energy and light.

32:45.897 --> 32:46.556
We have limitations!

32:46.631 --> 32:47.893
No!

32:47.966 --> 32:49.627
No, no, no, no, no!

32:49.701 --> 32:53.102
We don't need nourishment,
we don't suffer disease.

32:53.171 --> 32:55.298
We're the higher form of life.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.304
What's that?

33:01.379 --> 33:02.403
Lower deck.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.448
Someone's trying
to access my matrix.

33:04.515 --> 33:05.641
l'll be back.

33:18.963 --> 33:20.328
You!

33:42.086 --> 33:43.986
No!

33:44.055 --> 33:46.683
N- N- N- No!

33:49.694 --> 33:51.093
B'Elanna!

34:00.238 --> 34:05.540
Ensign Kim, Personal Log,
Stardate 51 186. 2.

34:05.610 --> 34:06.838
Working with Seven of Nine

34:06.911 --> 34:08.969
is starting to get
a little awkward.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.206
Tom's right.

34:10.281 --> 34:13.681
Anything more than friendship
is a bad idea...

34:13.751 --> 34:16.014
but l can't stop thinking
about her.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.524
You wished to see me, Ensign.

34:25.596 --> 34:27.460
l had this midnight inspiration

34:27.532 --> 34:30.159
about reconfiguring
astrometric projectors.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.360
l hope you weren't...
regenerating.

34:32.437 --> 34:33.927
l was not.

34:34.972 --> 34:36.199
This is tricky stuff.

34:36.274 --> 34:37.571
lt could use your touch.

34:39.143 --> 34:40.110
Your way of looking at things?

34:40.178 --> 34:41.509
A fresh perspective?

34:41.579 --> 34:44.980
Your data.

34:45.049 --> 34:46.572
Why don't you sit down?

34:46.650 --> 34:47.811
l prefer to stand.

34:47.885 --> 34:48.976
This could take a while.

34:49.053 --> 34:50.350
You'd be more comfortable.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.685
Comfort is irrelevant--
we're here to work.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.349
Okay.

34:56.893 --> 34:58.589
This light is insufficient.

34:58.663 --> 35:00.927
But it's relaxing,
don't you think?

35:01.032 --> 35:02.397
After hours, quiet.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.526
Voyager isn't
all Jefferies tubes

35:04.602 --> 35:06.695
and cargo bays, you know.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.602
Tell you what--
when we're done here

35:08.673 --> 35:10.265
l'll take you to the holodeck.

35:10.341 --> 35:12.536
We'll run the Ktarian
moonrise simulation.

35:12.610 --> 35:13.599
lt's beautiful.

35:13.678 --> 35:15.703
Beauty is irrelevant.

35:18.883 --> 35:22.478
Unless you wish to change
the nature of our affiliation.

35:22.553 --> 35:24.578
What do you mean?

35:24.655 --> 35:26.646
l may be new to individuality,

35:26.724 --> 35:29.522
but l'm not ignorant
of human behavior.

35:29.594 --> 35:31.118
l've noticed your attempts

35:31.195 --> 35:33.254
to engage me
in idle conversation,

35:33.331 --> 35:35.526
and l see the way
your pupils dilate

35:35.600 --> 35:37.090
when you look at my body.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.466
l don't know
what you're talking about.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.505
Obviously, you've suggested
a visit to the holodeck

35:41.572 --> 35:44.200
in the hopes of creating
a romantic mood.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.833
Are you in love with me, Ensign?

35:45.910 --> 35:47.639
Well...

35:47.712 --> 35:48.701
no.

35:48.779 --> 35:50.076
Then you wish to copulate.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.115
No!

35:51.182 --> 35:52.410
l mean...l...

35:52.483 --> 35:54.576
l, l don't know what l mean.

35:54.652 --> 35:58.315
All of these elaborate rituals
of deception...

35:58.389 --> 36:00.220
l didn't realize
becoming human again

36:00.324 --> 36:02.451
would be such a challenge.

36:02.493 --> 36:05.587
Sexuality is
particularly complex.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.460
As Borg, we had no need
for seduction,

36:07.532 --> 36:10.262
no time
for single- cell fertilization.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.428
We saw a species we wanted,
and we assimilated it.

36:13.504 --> 36:17.907
Nevertheless, l am willing
to explore my humanity.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.705
Take off your clothes.

36:20.778 --> 36:22.143
Uh...

36:22.213 --> 36:23.271
Seven...

36:23.347 --> 36:24.473
Don't be alarmed.

36:24.549 --> 36:25.709
l won't hurt you.

36:25.783 --> 36:27.683
Look, this is a little sudden.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.049
l was just...

36:29.120 --> 36:31.088
trying to...

36:31.155 --> 36:34.420
part of the team, you know?

36:34.492 --> 36:36.790
Uh...

36:36.861 --> 36:39.329
Maybe we should
just quit for now.

36:39.397 --> 36:40.728
All right.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.731
Let me know when you wish
to resume our work.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.218
lt's all right, B'Elanna.

37:04.288 --> 37:06.085
You're safe.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.853
The isomorph?

37:08.926 --> 37:11.827
Apparently, you deactivated him.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.396
l took all of his emitters
off- line.

37:15.466 --> 37:16.865
Not a moment too soon.

37:16.968 --> 37:20.335
l found six corpses on this
deck, all of them murdered.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.338
You almost became number seven.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.105
Oh! What did he do to me?

37:27.178 --> 37:28.440
He reached inside your chest,

37:28.512 --> 37:30.207
grabbed your heart,
and perforated

37:30.281 --> 37:31.248
your fourth ventricle.

37:31.315 --> 37:32.407
Great.

37:32.483 --> 37:33.609
l've stabilized

37:33.684 --> 37:35.584
your pericardium,
but l'm concerned about

37:35.653 --> 37:36.711
the internal bleeding.

37:36.787 --> 37:37.879
Prognosis?

37:37.955 --> 37:39.252
Less than stellar,

37:39.323 --> 37:40.847
unless l can get you
back to Voyager.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.290
Unfortunately,
l'm having trouble

37:42.360 --> 37:43.588
accessing our transporters.

37:44.829 --> 37:47.696
He must've disabled
our com- link to the shuttle.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.824
Help me get
to the command chamber.

37:52.870 --> 37:56.328
Looks like he set up
a dampening field.

37:56.407 --> 37:58.932
l think l can cut through it,
but...

37:59.076 --> 38:02.842
l'll need to open
this control panel.

38:02.947 --> 38:06.110
My engineering kit...
is on that console.

38:10.421 --> 38:12.685
B'Elanna, l thought you said

38:12.757 --> 38:15.749
you took all of the emitters
off- line.

38:15.826 --> 38:18.454
l did. Why?

38:18.529 --> 38:20.724
l think you'd better
double- check.

38:24.235 --> 38:25.759
You said you'd help me.

38:25.836 --> 38:27.565
Put that down.

38:27.638 --> 38:28.866
You lied.

38:29.940 --> 38:32.101
You lied to me.

38:32.176 --> 38:33.234
l thought you were my friend.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.278
lt's for your own benefit.

38:34.345 --> 38:36.609
Someone needs to repair
your program.

38:36.681 --> 38:39.548
lt's malfunctioning.
You're unstable.

38:39.617 --> 38:41.346
No, no, no!

38:41.419 --> 38:42.852
You're unstable!

38:42.920 --> 38:45.980
You're a hologram
who thinks like an organic!

38:49.727 --> 38:52.628
This could get tedious.

39:05.276 --> 39:07.039
Freedom.

39:15.252 --> 39:18.551
Oh...you're getting
blood everywhere.

39:21.892 --> 39:24.019
l'm going to have
to deactivate you.

41:01.859 --> 41:03.258
ls he...?

41:03.327 --> 41:05.261
Deactivated.

41:05.329 --> 41:07.058
And you?

41:07.131 --> 41:08.826
Ready to get out of here.

41:27.384 --> 41:28.544
Come in.

41:29.820 --> 41:32.880
We've completed the schematics
for the Astrometrics Lab.

41:32.957 --> 41:34.424
Already?

41:34.492 --> 41:36.460
You and Seven must
have been putting in

41:36.527 --> 41:38.222
a lot of extra hours on this.

41:38.295 --> 41:40.490
She's not much
for procrastinating.

41:40.564 --> 41:41.963
l'm sure she's not.

41:44.201 --> 41:46.431
Looks like you're ready
to begin construction.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.971
lt might be better--

41:48.038 --> 41:51.735
more practical-- to bring in
an engineering team for that.

41:51.809 --> 41:53.777
Recruit all the help you need.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.904
ln fact, they should probably
take over at this point.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.949
Don't you want to supervise
their work?

41:59.016 --> 42:00.677
The Astrometrics Lab
is your baby.

42:00.784 --> 42:02.718
l would. Of course.

42:02.753 --> 42:04.243
Um, l just don't think

42:04.321 --> 42:05.913
that that would be the best use
of ship's personnel.

42:05.990 --> 42:07.855
Oh, l can rearrange
the duty shifts.

42:07.925 --> 42:10.655
Oh, no, Commander,
you don't have to do that.

42:10.728 --> 42:13.424
l'm sure Seven can handle things
without me.

42:13.497 --> 42:17.490
Harry...are you having
some kind of problem with her?

42:17.568 --> 42:19.832
Oh, no. No problem.

42:19.904 --> 42:22.930
Because if you are,
l'd like to hear about it.

42:23.007 --> 42:25.305
No, sir, there's no problem.
Not at all.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.071
Absolutely not.

42:27.144 --> 42:28.543
Um...

42:28.612 --> 42:30.944
So, if you'll excuse me,
l'll be going now.

42:31.015 --> 42:32.141
Ensign Kim...

42:33.317 --> 42:35.080
let's have it.

42:40.224 --> 42:43.455
We...We had a misunderstanding.

42:43.527 --> 42:45.119
About?

42:45.195 --> 42:47.095
Oh, it's nothing
really important.

42:47.164 --> 42:49.962
Just your basic Borg- human
cultural differences.

42:50.034 --> 42:51.899
Really?

42:51.969 --> 42:53.937
That's not what she says.

42:54.004 --> 42:55.995
You...

42:56.106 --> 42:57.004
Y- You...

42:57.107 --> 42:58.938
You spoke...
You spoke to her.

42:59.009 --> 43:01.705
She seems to think
you're making good progress.

43:01.812 --> 43:03.803
She finds you
reasonably efficient,

43:03.847 --> 43:06.372
and says you've been
helping her learn more

43:06.450 --> 43:08.714
about our complex
social interactions.

43:08.786 --> 43:10.720
Any idea what she meant by that?

43:10.788 --> 43:13.882
l can't imagine.

43:13.958 --> 43:15.789
You two make a good team.

43:15.859 --> 43:19.090
l want to keep you together
on this project.

43:19.163 --> 43:20.562
Sir...

43:22.166 --> 43:23.531
Aye, sir.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.762
And maybe others in the future.

43:25.836 --> 43:27.497
Have fun.

43:34.044 --> 43:35.443
l've stopped
the internal bleeding

43:35.512 --> 43:37.070
and repaired the tissue damage.

43:37.147 --> 43:40.344
Your pericardium is
clean as a whistle.

43:40.417 --> 43:43.318
Which is more than l can say
for my Sick Bay.

43:43.387 --> 43:44.319
l'm sorry about the mess.

43:44.388 --> 43:47.551
l haven't had time to clean up.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.922
lt was a hectic day.

43:48.993 --> 43:50.722
l treated two broken bones,

43:50.794 --> 43:53.354
an upset stomach
and a lacerated hand.

43:53.430 --> 43:56.126
Does this mean you're too tired
to meet later...

43:56.200 --> 43:58.191
in my quarters?

43:58.268 --> 44:00.099
Are you sure
your heart can take it?

44:00.204 --> 44:02.695
l'm detecting
elevated hormonal levels.

44:02.740 --> 44:04.469
lf you two don't take it easy,

44:04.541 --> 44:07.009
l'll have to declare
a medical emergency.

44:07.077 --> 44:10.137
lf you'll excuse me,
l have to go check on Harry.

44:10.214 --> 44:12.648
l hear he's having
a nervous breakdown.

44:12.716 --> 44:13.910
lt's a long story.

44:14.018 --> 44:15.315
Not so fast, Mr. Paris.

44:15.386 --> 44:17.377
You are going
to help me sterilize

44:17.454 --> 44:19.854
every square millimeter
of this Sick Bay.

44:19.923 --> 44:23.324
No doubt, you've left your oily
residue on every hypospray,

44:23.394 --> 44:26.386
your sloughed secretions
on every console.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.931
Just kidding.

44:29.033 --> 44:30.660
ln fact,
l've had a change of heart

44:30.734 --> 44:32.531
about my fastidiousness.

44:32.603 --> 44:35.231
A little clutter
never hurt anyone.

44:35.305 --> 44:38.536
Sick Bay should have a more
organic touch, don't you think?

44:38.609 --> 44:41.305
To help our patients feel...
more at home?

44:48.152 --> 44:50.814
What's gotten into him?

44:50.888 --> 44:53.015
lt's a long story.
