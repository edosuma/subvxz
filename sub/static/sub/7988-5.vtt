I have to go.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.823
Your stature
doesn't make you safer.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.154

I've made myself clear.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.508
Pulling the advertising
from his papers

04:56.671 --> 04:57.547
is a big mistake.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.931
He hurt my family.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.637
I beg you to reconsider.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.348
This situation
is all my fault.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.058
What happened
with Flic and me...

05:04.221 --> 05:06.019
What you did
was reprehensible.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.933
Then let me fix it.

05:08.099 --> 05:08.975
I can get a retraction,

05:09.142 --> 05:10.394
set the record straight
for Rosalie.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.858
I want a page one retraction
and my family off limits,

05:13.021 --> 05:14.364
or I pull
the advertising.

05:14.523 --> 05:15.149
Is that clear?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.441
I'll do my best.

05:16.608 --> 05:17.530
You better had.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.958
Oh, Mr. Selfridge,
what a relief.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.414
I don't want to be
the bad one!

05:27.577 --> 05:31.878
She gets to seduce Bumby Wallace

05:32.040 --> 05:33.166
Holy cow, Jenny Dolly,

05:33.333 --> 05:34.755
just do what it <i>says</i>
in the photoplay.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.135
You work as a double act:

05:36.294 --> 05:37.546
one steals while
the other distracts.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.180
You're both bad news.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.513
I suppose the bad ones
are the fun ones.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.600
Come on, Jenny,
let's go and recap our steps.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.024
We are running behind
because of them!

05:49.182 --> 05:50.399
Our costs are soaring.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.904
Just do what you can
to keep them on track.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.861
I beg that you
remain nearby.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.197
The sisters' behavior
is excitable.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.159
They respond well to you,
and only to you.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.540
Wasted time is wasted money.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.245
Oh, heavens!

06:09.411 --> 06:13.086
No, together, ladies, please!

06:13.248 --> 06:13.965
I'm so sorry about the way
Meryl found out.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.585
I'm so sorry about the way
Meryl found out.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.924
She's very upset.

06:19.087 --> 06:22.432
And your other children,
have you told them?

06:25.510 --> 06:26.807
Yes.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.768
Last night.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.654
Are you still at the hotel?

06:36.813 --> 06:38.815
I am, yes.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.359
How long are you staying
in London?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.030
I don't know.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.494
I wondered if you might stay
with Mr. Crabb,

06:47.657 --> 06:49.409
since he was the one

06:49.576 --> 06:50.919
who invited you back.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.172
Arthur was genuinely worried
about you.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.332
He didn't know what else to do.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.670
He could have done nothing.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.210
Have either of you
considered that?

06:58.376 --> 07:00.424
Oh, Roger,
I couldn't have stayed away...

07:00.587 --> 07:02.589
I appreciate your wanting
to help, really, I do.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.222
But we made a clean break
seven years ago.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.636
It wasn't as simple as that.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.804
Thank you.

07:20.190 --> 07:24.491
Look, I can't revisit
all this.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.953
Not now, not here.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.663
Then perhaps we could meet
somewhere privately.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.728
Mr. Selfridge demands
a page one retraction

07:53.890 --> 07:56.018
of the story
about his daughter.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.614
I'm sorry to have hurt
Mrs. De Bolotoff.

08:00.772 --> 08:05.027
I did try to apologize
personally.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.241
We'd appreciate it
on the front page.

08:10.407 --> 08:14.207
For Mrs. De Bolotoff's sake,
I'll make sure it's done.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.718
Mr. Selfridge
also requests

08:21.876 --> 08:23.469
that all stories
about his family

08:23.628 --> 08:25.221
be off-limits from now on.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.552
You're a newspaper man, Frank.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.342
You know that's impossible.

08:28.508 --> 08:32.308
If you refuse, Selfridge's
will withdraw all advertising

08:32.470 --> 08:34.847
from all your newspapers.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.938
You'd never do that.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.355
May I remind you our advertising
budget is quite large.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.071
My dailies have the highest
readership in the country.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.656
Mr. Selfridge is very protective
of his family.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.418
Now, if he wants
to take me on,

08:55.577 --> 08:57.545
he can do it himself

08:57.704 --> 09:00.503
and not send his flunky.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.966
Now get out.

09:11.176 --> 09:14.476
Mr. Selfridge,
this has just come in.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.186
A recent gambling bill

09:17.348 --> 09:21.069
charged to you
by J. and R. Dolly.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.032
I will deal with this.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.844
Bad day?

09:47.003 --> 09:48.346
Tiring.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.764
Is everything
all right, Frank?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.270
Of course,
why wouldn't it be'?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.021
You just seem a bit
out of sorts lately,

09:57.180 --> 09:58.272
that's all.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.935
Since you got back
from France.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.319
What's France got to do
with anything?

10:09.859 --> 10:13.614
I've been thinking
about what you said

10:13.780 --> 10:16.283
when you got back.

10:16.449 --> 10:20.249
About family
and us having children.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.382
Did you really mean it?

10:24.541 --> 10:25.713
Yes.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.837
It's just...

10:29.003 --> 10:32.052
Well, it has rather come
out of the blue

10:32.215 --> 10:33.637
and I thought we were happy

10:33.800 --> 10:35.177
as we were?

10:35.343 --> 10:37.391
We are, but...

10:37.554 --> 10:40.023
But what?

10:40.181 --> 10:42.650
I just wonder
if we're being selfish.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.152
If there's more to life.

10:44.310 --> 10:48.281
Well, it's different for you.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.066
You're a man,

10:50.233 --> 10:52.827
and I'd have
to leave my job.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.455
We never properly discussed
the Elizabeth Arden offer.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.457
It was just dismissed
out of hand.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.243
Yes, of course, Elizabeth Arden,
how could we forget?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.457
She'll need an answer,
Frank.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.495
Have you ever thought

11:02.662 --> 11:03.663
that we're too wrapped up
in ourselves

11:03.830 --> 11:06.583
to notice that
we're drifting apart?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.881
You don't mean us.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.175
You mean me.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.843
That was unfair, Kitty,
I'm sorry.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.170
Rosie, I need to...

11:44.329 --> 11:46.127
I need to talk to you
about this bill.

11:46.289 --> 11:47.882
You did say
you'd cover our credit.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.136
Well, I didn't expect you
to be so outrageous.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.136
It's a lot of money.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.675
If you want us
to pay you back...?

11:56.841 --> 11:58.468
No, Rosie,
you're missing the point.

11:58.635 --> 12:02.356
You gals need to take this film
more seriously.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.060
All the hullaballoo
from earlier today...

12:04.224 --> 12:05.100
I know.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.609
Jenny can be such a nightmare.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.855
I'll talk to her.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.786
The delays are because of you,
which is costing me money.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.121
You do know
we don't take it for granted,

12:22.283 --> 12:24.456
what you're doing for us.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.342
I don't take it for granted.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.718
HARRY:
This will mean a lot to Rosalie.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.805

to back off my family?

12:39.968 --> 12:41.936
No more lies or gossip
about them?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.187
On that, he was less amenable.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.472
What did he say?

12:44.639 --> 12:47.483
I just wouldn't push him
on this one, chief.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.359

Well, that is
nice to see.

will you do that?

Don't you worry about that.

for his next investment.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.717
Does that work for you?

14:40.880 --> 14:41.756
Oh, yes.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.766
You know me, Harry.

14:43.925 --> 14:47.225
I love a good time, but I'm
concentrating on me right now.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.264
I love my work here.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.273
Forgive the intrusion,
Harry,

14:55.436 --> 14:59.441
but when I came into your
office yesterday, that man...

14:59.607 --> 15:01.951
So who's he?

15:02.110 --> 15:03.862
My gaming agent.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.372
Things seemed
a little tense.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.784
He's making a small
nuisance of himself,

15:08.950 --> 15:11.169
but everything
will be fine.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.208
Where are the Dolly Sisters?

15:16.374 --> 15:18.468
We should be filming.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.344
Oh, I think I saw them
in Fashion.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.629
Shopping?

15:21.796 --> 15:25.266
Well, it was all
rather anarchic.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.143
I'll leave that with you.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.350
Unbelievable.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.980
A job offer
from the Elizabeth Arden?

15:36.394 --> 15:38.396
In America?

15:38.563 --> 15:42.534
I'm to reply by the end
of tomorrow, or the job goes.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.444
How does Frank feel
about all this?

15:44.610 --> 15:47.864
He has no interest in New York.

15:48.030 --> 15:52.080
He's talking
about starting a family.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.416
Out of nowhere!

15:54.579 --> 15:56.422
Why would he suddenly
want a baby?

15:56.581 --> 15:58.549
How do I know?

15:58.708 --> 16:00.676
Well, you're a man,
you must have some idea.

16:05.173 --> 16:08.677
Well, when Connie told me
she was pregnant,

16:08.843 --> 16:10.845
it was the happiest day
of my life.

16:11.012 --> 16:11.934
What about your wedding day?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.097
Didn't come close.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.857
I wouldn't tell Connie that.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.690
I can't answer for Frank,

16:17.852 --> 16:19.354
but I've always got along
with kids.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.903
Comes natural to me.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.284
But I don't think him
wanting a baby

16:25.443 --> 16:27.286
is a bad thing.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.163
I think it means he loves you.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.366
Yeah.

16:34.452 --> 16:38.923
Maybe I've been selfish,
always putting work first.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.304
Do you still love him?

16:44.462 --> 16:46.715
More than anything in the world.

16:49.634 --> 16:53.184
Then you need to be talking
to him, not me.

16:55.806 --> 16:56.898
I'm sorry I'm late.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.277
I had to manage an issue
in the fashion department.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.153
I was just discussing
the cinema window display.

17:01.312 --> 17:02.939
Just keep in mind
that our displays

17:03.105 --> 17:04.948
make us into the landmark
that we are today.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.281
People come from all around
just to see our windows.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.414
Frank, can you provide
the right publicity?

17:11.571 --> 17:13.118
<i>Our usual spots with The Mail,
The Mirror...</i>

17:13.281 --> 17:15.079
<i>The London Herald?</i>

17:15.242 --> 17:16.711
Yes, all of Lord Wynnstay's
papers.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.417
Really?
As usual.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.457
GROVE: How are plans for the
after-party going, Mr. Lyons?

17:21.624 --> 17:23.718
Oh, swimmingly.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.502
We've got Victor Colleano

17:25.670 --> 17:26.922
bringing his club night
to Selfridge's.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.590
"A Night with the Stars."

17:28.756 --> 17:30.508
A private party
with lots of prominent people.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.848
All the costs to go
on my Chairman's Account.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.680
Thank you all very much.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.393
Frank, a quick word?

17:42.562 --> 17:45.532
How are things at home
after Flic and the article?

17:45.690 --> 17:48.443
I'm ashamed, Harry,
no mistake.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.282
I know your shame.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.821
I don't have a wife
to make it up to.

17:51.988 --> 17:52.830
You do.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.037
I want you to ask Kitty
to the party tomorrow.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.076
I'm not sure.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.962
You need to find a way to make
your marriage strong again.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.293
You concentrate on that

18:01.455 --> 18:03.253
and I'll deal
with Lord Wynnstay.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.884
Chief...

18:05.042 --> 18:06.168
We need to thrash it out
face to face.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.554
Men like us,
we know how to get along.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.304
(Sighs)

18:15.261 --> 18:16.137
Hello!

18:16.304 --> 18:18.227
What are you doing
down here?

18:18.389 --> 18:21.313
Trying to get a look
at Bumby Wallace!

18:21.475 --> 18:22.727
Oh, look!

18:24.812 --> 18:25.688
Connie!

18:27.773 --> 18:29.446
You're starting
to show.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.781
Can l...?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.164
There's a baby in there.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.203
I know.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.588
It's starting to feel
more real now.

18:42.747 --> 18:46.001
You'll be leaving soon.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.341
Are you going to miss this?

18:49.503 --> 18:50.504
The store?

18:53.174 --> 18:55.973
No, because deep down,
it's what I've always wanted:

18:56.135 --> 18:58.388
to be a mother.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.152
You're in a funny old mood.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.233
I'm fine.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.613
You should get back
upstairs.

19:11.776 --> 19:12.652
Yeah.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.819
Go on!

19:13.986 --> 19:16.034
All right, bossy britches.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.550
How did we let it
slip through our fingers?

19:30.461 --> 19:32.179
We loved each other,
didn't we?

19:32.338 --> 19:34.056
Yes, of course we did.

19:34.215 --> 19:38.561
That was the simple part.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.346
It was the rest
that was complicated.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.817
I've had years
to think about it.

19:44.975 --> 19:48.149
At the time,
I was angry with you.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.280
I thought you gave up
too easily.

19:52.483 --> 19:55.953
I ran away.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.409
There you go, I've said it.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.456
I'd always been a lone woman.

20:03.619 --> 20:08.170
A big family
was overwhelming.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.675
The children
had lost their mother,

20:09.834 --> 20:14.806
and their little faces
all turned to me.

20:14.964 --> 20:18.719
Meryl was so angry,

20:18.884 --> 20:22.229
so resentful at this new woman
in her father's life.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.607
I didn't help,

20:24.765 --> 20:28.440
trying to rush a new marriage
on you, on them.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.616
You just thought marriage
would fix it.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.366
You didn't want to see
your children in pain.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.281
It was all so raw.

20:43.284 --> 20:47.005
I left you all,

20:47.163 --> 20:49.257
and if I could do things
differently, I...

20:53.210 --> 20:55.508
Please forgive me, Roger.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.726
Is that why you're here?

21:00.885 --> 21:02.432
To ask forgiveness?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.393
No, that's not why I'm here.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.578
I was going to retire.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.738
Be with my children.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.080
Enjoy my last years.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.460
I'm so afraid.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.220
(sobbing)

21:37.379 --> 21:38.471
I know, I know.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.223
<i>(door opens)</i>

21:43.385 --> 21:46.480
Slowly now, Roger,
do step carefully.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.691
Thank you, Josie,
for listening.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.901
For everything.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.866
I'm sorry, I'm exhausted.

21:58.025 --> 21:58.947
I know.

22:02.988 --> 22:03.864
Good night.

22:04.031 --> 22:04.953
Good night.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.843
Is he all right?

22:20.005 --> 22:24.476
He's just going up to sleep.

22:24.635 --> 22:25.932
Did something happen?

22:26.095 --> 22:28.564
We talked.

22:28.722 --> 22:29.939
It was difficult.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.318
We both got a bit upset.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.074
Would you like some tea?

22:39.233 --> 22:41.452
Good old British tea.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.001
Meryl, I can't tell you
how sorry I am

22:53.163 --> 22:54.881
that you found out
the way you did.

22:57.126 --> 23:02.633
It's been quite a shock,
but it's better we all know.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.052
I think we both know your father
has a way of avoiding

23:06.218 --> 23:08.767
anything unpleasant.

23:08.929 --> 23:12.684
Like how he avoided
how beastly I was being to you

23:12.850 --> 23:14.272
before you went away.

23:14.435 --> 23:17.279
Oh, you were a child.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.691
And I didn't leave
because of you.

23:19.857 --> 23:20.949
Please know that.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.989
It was everything.

23:27.156 --> 23:29.579
Your father
isn't the only one

23:29.742 --> 23:33.042
to avoid difficult
situations, Meryl.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.706
I discovered an unhealthy streak
of cowardice in myself

23:35.873 --> 23:37.375
at the time.

23:38.626 --> 23:41.049
Are you going back to New York?

23:41.211 --> 23:43.555
Oh, I shall stay
as long as your father needs me.

23:43.714 --> 23:44.636
No.

23:44.798 --> 23:48.974
Even if he says
he doesn't want you to stay.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.309
Oh, my dear Meryl.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.109
I'm not going anywhere.

24:02.650 --> 24:05.745
Look, you see?
Cartoons being sent by wire.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.246
(laughing)

24:07.404 --> 24:08.747
Ridiculous!

24:08.906 --> 24:10.499
I don't know
why I take this paper.

24:10.658 --> 24:11.910
There's no actual news in it.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.496
You seem bright.

24:15.663 --> 24:18.883
I don't remember
the last time I slept so well.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.927
Maybe your talk with Miss Mardle
did you some good?

24:27.174 --> 24:28.642
She stayed

24:28.801 --> 24:30.223
for a cup of tea
last night.

24:33.931 --> 24:34.807
I invited her

24:34.974 --> 24:35.850
for dinner tonight.

24:37.393 --> 24:38.736
Did you?

24:38.894 --> 24:40.487
I'm sure the children
would love to see her.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.527
Apparently,
she's not leaving London.

24:46.694 --> 24:49.117
She isn't?

24:49.279 --> 24:51.281
Well, that's what
she said to me.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.291
Would you like a boiled egg?

24:53.450 --> 24:54.793
Can you boil an egg?

24:54.952 --> 24:56.420
Well...

24:56.578 --> 24:58.421
I can try.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.219
(door opens)

25:04.378 --> 25:05.254
Ah!

25:05.421 --> 25:07.469
I thought I'd
see you soon.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.643
I want stories
about my family off-limits.

25:11.802 --> 25:13.475
Me, fine.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.685
I chose this life, they didn't.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.725
You have to understand,
Wynnstay.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.019
No, you have to understand,
Selfridge.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.311
lam not your puppet.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.525
We both know

25:22.688 --> 25:25.191
that you can't afford to lose
my advertising contract.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.734
Is that so?

25:26.900 --> 25:27.696
Mm.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.162
Look, I'm hosting
a party tonight.

25:34.324 --> 25:35.371
Why don't you come?

25:35.534 --> 25:37.582
Now that we both
understand each other.

25:37.745 --> 25:40.214
We understand each other
perfectly.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.670
It's reassuring to know

25:42.833 --> 25:44.506
that money still talks.

25:50.049 --> 25:50.971
(door closes)

25:54.178 --> 25:55.225
Find Flic.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.264
Send her to me.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.274
♪♪

26:07.149 --> 26:08.025
And cut!

26:08.192 --> 26:10.695
That's a wrap!

26:10.861 --> 26:12.454
Thanks, Bumby.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.741
(applause)

26:18.994 --> 26:19.870
Mr. Crabb.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.334
I'm glad I've seen you.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.295
I'm afraid I'm about to leave
for a meeting.

26:23.457 --> 26:24.800
Well, I just...

26:24.958 --> 26:30.010
I wanted to clear the air,
say I'm sorry.

26:30.172 --> 26:33.517
I know perfectly well
why you called Miss Mardle.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.973
You said it was
unforgiveable.

26:36.136 --> 26:40.642
Arthur, there isn't
a bad bone in your body.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.560
In fact, I need to thank you.

26:42.726 --> 26:46.151
Josie and I had a rather
good talk last night.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.987
I'm glad.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.651
She might even stay in London.

26:52.277 --> 26:55.907
Whatever has passed between you,
I do know this:

26:56.073 --> 26:57.495
She is devoted to you, Roger.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.410
Always has been,

26:59.576 --> 27:00.828
always will be.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.670
About this film
party tonight,

27:09.837 --> 27:14.308
I came to ask if you'd do me
the honor of accompanying me?

27:14.466 --> 27:17.140
I thought things have become
distant between us?

27:17.302 --> 27:19.725
"The glamorous Edwards' went out
onto the town last night,

27:19.888 --> 27:21.265
"all eyes on them,

27:21.431 --> 27:25.356
she in a million dollar dress,
he in a luxury tuxedo."

27:27.437 --> 27:28.359
If you insist.

27:37.614 --> 27:38.160
(knocking)

27:38.323 --> 27:39.245
Come.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.165
Ah, here she is.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.338
London's most feared reporter.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.547
What can I do for you, sir?

27:48.709 --> 27:51.212
Do you want to go
to a party tonight?

27:51.378 --> 27:53.722
I need you to do
some digging.

27:56.049 --> 27:58.643
Thank you, gentlemen.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.055
Sorry I'm a little late,
Mr. Keen.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.143
Mr. Crabb.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.816
We could've met at the store.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.606
Better here.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.704
As you know,
the Civic Building Society

28:17.863 --> 28:19.957
have recently acquired more
shares in the Selfridge Group.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.413
Indeed.

28:23.577 --> 28:26.376
It's my job to encourage

28:26.538 --> 28:30.338
a more transparent
relationship between us.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.590
There's some concern about
Mr. Selfridge's lavish spending.

28:36.757 --> 28:39.556
There's been concern about that
for 20 years.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.560
Quite.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.845
I've noted that

28:42.012 --> 28:45.312
the chairman's account
is very much in the red.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.318
There have been a lot
of expenses lately.

28:48.477 --> 28:51.697
Trip to France, the film,
tonight's party...

28:51.855 --> 28:53.448
Recent gambling bill, too.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.450
Rather big.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.117
He does seem to blend

28:59.279 --> 29:01.532
his personal
and professional expenses.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.041
Actually, Mr. Selfridge

29:03.200 --> 29:04.577
is very much aware
of the situation.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.246
He asked me to put a hold

29:07.412 --> 29:08.709
on the chairman's
account today.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.586
You're very loyal,
aren't you?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.180
To Mr. Selfridge.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.558
I'm an old dog on along road.

29:19.716 --> 29:23.437
Rest assured, I know exactly
where you're coming from.

29:41.655 --> 29:42.577
Good evening, madam.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.121
Welcome!

29:45.284 --> 29:47.912
Why thank you,
young sir.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.752
ALICE: Good evening, Miss
Mardle, nice to see you again.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.541
Oh, there you are.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.210
MERYL:
Thank you.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.844
Ernest!

29:56.003 --> 29:57.255
You'd better take the lady's
hat and coat.

29:59.381 --> 30:00.473
Oh, right.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.229
The Grove Restaurant
is open

30:10.392 --> 30:13.020
especially for you,
Miss Mardle.

30:17.858 --> 30:18.780
Thank you.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.245
Oh, my goodness.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.156
This was their idea.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.245
Thank you.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.123
Allow me.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.257
They come in,
names taken at the door,

30:37.419 --> 30:38.591
walk along here.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.848
This area is roped off
for hacks and whatnot.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.633
Then they go up.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.847
Smooth operation here,
George.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.887
It's funny working
together again.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.022
It feels like old times.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.851
How long before the chief
gets here?

30:53.018 --> 30:54.736
Any minute now.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.784
Harry, what are you doing here?

31:04.946 --> 31:07.495
I wanted to pick you up,
escort you to the party myself.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.832
I'm not ready.

31:12.329 --> 31:13.376
Is there someone in there?

31:13.538 --> 31:16.462
Of course not.

31:16.625 --> 31:17.501
Excuse me.

31:17.667 --> 31:18.884
Mr. Wallace.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.134
Harry, wait.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.172
Come to the party,

31:22.339 --> 31:23.591
but for God sakes, behave.

31:23.757 --> 31:25.759
Keep professional
and stay away from me.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.365
I feel like an old fool, Mae.

31:44.528 --> 31:45.745
They've been
bleeding me dry.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.872
And what did you expect?

31:48.031 --> 31:50.250
Bumby Wallace is
a bona fide film star.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.788
And those sisters,
they are as ambitious as hell.

31:53.954 --> 31:55.501
I've been blinded.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.042
Not by love, that's for sure.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.585
(laughs)

31:59.751 --> 32:03.051
Kick a guy when he's down,
why don't you?

32:03.213 --> 32:04.635
(Sighs)

32:04.798 --> 32:06.926
I don't think
I can face this party.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.845
Oh, stop it,
of course you can.

32:10.011 --> 32:12.184
We're going to go downstairs,
and you're just going

32:12.347 --> 32:14.224
to keep those sisters
on a short leash.

32:14.391 --> 32:17.110
I'm not gonna let them pull
the wool over my eyes again.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.943
That's the spirit.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.199
So come on, let's get up.

32:22.357 --> 32:25.577
Your illustrious guests await,
and even Jimmy's coming,

32:25.735 --> 32:27.328
so we can all let our hair down.
(laughs)

32:32.409 --> 32:33.501
These are marvelous.

32:33.660 --> 32:34.786
GROVE:
Aren't they?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.000
I shall be taking photographs
of all of you.

32:36.163 --> 32:41.590
We should make
some family albums.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.549
That's a good idea.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.636
Miss Mardle, would you like

32:50.802 --> 32:52.679
to take a turn
around the garden?

32:52.846 --> 32:54.143
Yes, I'd love to.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.403
Here, let me.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.318
Oh, thank you.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.577
Thank you for coming.

33:14.743 --> 33:19.499
And for bringing me home
last night.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.337
I'm very glad
you're feeling better.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.672
You know, I am.

33:22.834 --> 33:28.216
I can see more clearly
how things were complicated.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.429
It has been a magical
evening tonight, Roger.

33:30.592 --> 33:31.889
Thank you.

33:32.052 --> 33:34.976
No, thank them.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.188
They are a credit to you,
they really are.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.773
I think now
I can look ahead.

33:40.936 --> 33:45.316
I intend to make the most
of what time I have left.

33:45.482 --> 33:48.782
I'm very relieved
to hear that.

33:48.944 --> 33:49.820
I'm thankful that things

33:49.986 --> 33:51.283
are no longer left unsaid
between us.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.572
Oh, hush, hush, hush.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.332
It's all been settled.

33:54.491 --> 33:58.166
Well, one matter hasn't.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.757
I feel if I don't ask
this question,

34:02.916 --> 34:04.418
I will always regret it.

34:09.422 --> 34:10.674
Will you be with me, Josie?

34:12.384 --> 34:13.385
Will you be my wife?

34:15.844 --> 34:17.722
Don't agree because I'm dying,

34:17.889 --> 34:20.813
or out of pity for me
or the children.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.478
I'm aware that
if you take me on,

34:22.643 --> 34:23.565
you take them on too.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.989
I take them on
with all my heart.

34:35.782 --> 34:40.788
I put this in my pocket
just in case.

34:40.954 --> 34:41.876
<i>(saws)</i>

34:54.842 --> 34:56.971
You haven't said yes.

35:02.017 --> 35:02.939
Yes.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.242
(kids clapping and cheering)

35:32.339 --> 35:36.094
It's nice to be on your arm,
like when we first stepped out.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.272
I know I threw you
with all that baby talk.

35:40.430 --> 35:43.900
I just wanted us to think
about it one last time.

35:47.354 --> 35:52.531
If I gave up work
to be a mother,

35:52.692 --> 35:54.865
would you still love me?

35:55.028 --> 35:57.622
I'd love you just the same!

35:57.781 --> 36:02.082
I love you more than anything
in the world, Kitty Edwards.

36:02.243 --> 36:05.668
Then let's do it.

36:05.830 --> 36:06.922
Let's try.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.550
What about the Elizabeth
Arden offer?

36:08.708 --> 36:11.257
I think I've got a better one.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.141
(laughing)

36:23.598 --> 36:25.100
♪♪

36:25.100 --> 36:26.977
♪♪

36:44.577 --> 36:46.545
FLIC:
Lord Wynnstay!

36:46.705 --> 36:48.423
Have some bubbles.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.093
Thank you.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.354
(music stops)

37:06.516 --> 37:07.733
Ladies and gents!

37:07.892 --> 37:10.111
As I look out,
I see the finest actors,

37:10.270 --> 37:14.650
artists, journalists, poets,

37:14.816 --> 37:17.114
and I think, "Thank God
I'm not paying for all this!"

37:17.277 --> 37:19.780
(laughter)

37:19.946 --> 37:22.244
Here's to the man who is.

37:22.407 --> 37:27.288
(applause)

37:29.664 --> 37:31.291
Thank you.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.051
(music starts)

37:39.841 --> 37:41.388
Forgive our interruption,

37:41.551 --> 37:44.179
but we had to do something
for our sweet Harry.

37:44.345 --> 37:48.270
We know he can't resist us!

37:48.433 --> 37:50.481
We hope he'll forgive us
for being so naughty.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.116
Dear God.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.586
I have a feeling tonight
will yield a story.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.007
The man's his own
cannon fodder.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.215
Frank...

38:18.296 --> 38:20.515
This wasn't really what I meant
by a short leash.

38:24.427 --> 38:27.271
(crowd gasping)

38:31.017 --> 38:32.394
Get them off that stage
and out of the store.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.982
Yes, sir.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.943
Come on, ladies,
off the stage.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.362
VICTOR: Apologies for that
unscheduled diversion.

38:42.529 --> 38:45.954
I hope you've got
your dancing shoes on!

38:46.115 --> 38:47.583
Ladies and gentleman,
Colleands house band!

38:47.742 --> 38:49.870
(applause)

38:53.164 --> 38:54.040
Harry?

38:54.207 --> 38:55.709
(music playing)

38:57.335 --> 38:58.177
Come on.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.212
The night is young.

38:59.379 --> 39:00.255
Mm-hmm.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.850
Mrs. Edwards?

39:09.013 --> 39:10.606
Felicity Jenner-- Flic.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.187
I work a lot with your husband.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.476
Pleased to meet you.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.604
Which paper do you work for?

39:16.771 --> 39:19.741
I didn't expect you to be
so beautiful.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.948
Champion party!

39:23.111 --> 39:25.284
We've only just got over
the last one Selfridge laid on.

39:26.489 --> 39:27.490
In France.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.920
Oh, you went to France?

39:32.078 --> 39:33.955
A whirlwind of glamour.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.465
We all had
a lot of fun.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.006
Ask Frank.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.149
Would you excuse me,
gentlemen?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.464
Has something happened?

40:20.627 --> 40:23.597
Did that woman
say something to you?

40:23.755 --> 40:27.259
Who? Flic?

40:27.425 --> 40:31.396
She said she didn't expect me
to be beautiful.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.433
That's nice,
to get a compliment.

40:34.599 --> 40:37.694
Why would she suspect
otherwise?

40:37.852 --> 40:42.153
Why would she have
any expectation at all?

40:42.315 --> 40:43.237
I...

40:44.400 --> 40:46.402
She's just a hack.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.786
Typically nosey.

40:47.946 --> 40:51.246
Sounds like you all had
quite a time of it in France.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.455
Tell me, when you got back,

40:53.618 --> 40:55.620
suddenly you wanted
to start a family.

40:55.787 --> 40:56.663
Why did you say that?

40:56.829 --> 40:58.547
We both want a family.

40:58.706 --> 40:59.923
No, you suggested it.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.085
We didn't want children
before that.

41:02.251 --> 41:04.379
Why did you suggest it?

41:04.545 --> 41:07.048
I realized
I might want a family.

41:07.215 --> 41:10.845
Really?

41:11.010 --> 41:12.512
Just like that?

41:12.679 --> 41:13.896
Out of nowhere?

41:20.395 --> 41:21.271
I was confused.

41:21.437 --> 41:22.359
I thought it might...

41:24.107 --> 41:25.154
...repair things.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.027
Repair things?

41:28.194 --> 41:30.242
How?

41:30.405 --> 41:32.328
How?

41:35.785 --> 41:37.753
Kitty, I'm so sorry.

41:37.912 --> 41:41.291
Kitty, I'm so sorry!

41:45.712 --> 41:48.010
You slept with that woman,
didn't you?

41:53.052 --> 41:54.304
(gasping)

42:00.143 --> 42:03.067
So, all that talk about a baby
had nothing to do with love

42:03.229 --> 42:05.231
and everything to do with guilt!

42:07.650 --> 42:11.029
I beg you, come...

42:11.195 --> 42:15.792
Come home and
let's talk about this.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.294
I'm just a foolish man.

42:24.167 --> 42:28.468
Until I decide what I want,
the spare room is yours.

42:31.132 --> 42:32.634
For now,
we continue the charade.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.347
Our boss is out there.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.512
Everything we've built
over the last 12...

42:38.598 --> 42:39.941
12 years.

42:40.099 --> 42:41.692
The position that I've reached.

42:41.851 --> 42:43.524
I'm not having you destroy it

42:43.686 --> 42:45.563
on account of you being
a foolish man.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.403
So get back down there

42:47.565 --> 42:50.535
and pretend to be the good
husband that you're not.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.292
(sobbing)

43:10.171 --> 43:11.093
HARRY:
Look who I found.

43:13.132 --> 43:14.509
Ah!

43:14.675 --> 43:16.427
I hope you've kept out
of trouble whilst I was away?

43:16.594 --> 43:16.810
Actually, it was Harry

43:16.803 --> 43:18.020
Actually, it was Harry

43:18.179 --> 43:19.931
who got himself
into a couple of a scrapes.

43:20.098 --> 43:21.600
I survived.

43:21.766 --> 43:22.562
Just.

43:24.310 --> 43:25.607
Excuse me.

43:27.814 --> 43:28.690
See you later.

43:28.856 --> 43:29.778
Of course.

43:32.777 --> 43:34.745
I missed you.

43:34.904 --> 43:37.532
Would've been nice
to have you with me.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.793
Jimmy, I've been a wife
and a lady of leisure.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.876
I make my own way now,
like you.

43:45.498 --> 43:47.296
VICTOR:
Mae!

43:47.458 --> 43:48.801
I nearly mistook you
for a movie star there.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.633
Flatterer!

43:50.795 --> 43:51.671
Join me round the piano?

43:51.838 --> 43:52.714
We're having a bit
of a sing-song.

43:52.880 --> 43:53.972
Ah!

43:54.132 --> 43:56.430
No, I think we're quite
comfortable here.

43:56.592 --> 43:58.185
No, I haven't sung in ages!

43:58.344 --> 43:59.766
Oh, please say you'll come
and join us, Jimmy?

43:59.929 --> 44:01.055
Singing's not my thing.

44:01.222 --> 44:02.269
Maybe after,
or something?

44:02.431 --> 44:03.728
No, no, I'm coming now.

44:14.402 --> 44:15.574
Play "The Mischief."

44:15.736 --> 44:17.283
Yes!

44:20.950 --> 44:22.122
I'll start.

44:22.285 --> 44:23.628

45:40.446 --> 45:41.413
We need to get this secure.

45:41.572 --> 45:42.573
Yes, sir.

45:42.740 --> 45:43.992
Police are
on their way, chief.
