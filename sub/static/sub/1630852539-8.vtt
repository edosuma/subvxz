00:18.518 --> 00:20.937
-(text whooshes)
-(clears throat)

00:23.648 --> 00:25.608
(clicks tongue)

00:25.692 --> 00:28.611
All right, y'all,

00:28.695 --> 00:30.488
Wait, you're, uh,
you're leavin'?

00:30.572 --> 00:32.031
(phone dings)

00:32.115 --> 00:34.159
Yeah, I'm about
to leave right now.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.793
(eerie music playing)

00:43.877 --> 00:47.714
Is-is everything good?

00:47.797 --> 00:51.176
Yeah, before you go, bro,
I, I really gotta talk
to you about somethin'.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.806
(sighs) Like what, man?

00:58.016 --> 01:00.143
Everything.

01:00.226 --> 01:03.062
The fuck is you
talkin' 'bout, bruh?

01:06.024 --> 01:07.317
Custer: Bro...

01:10.862 --> 01:13.448
The fuckin' cops
found Mouse's body.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.493
(glass shatters)

01:17.285 --> 01:18.536
Faye:
Sorry.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.478
(tense music)

01:43.561 --> 01:45.814
Did you hear what I said?

01:45.897 --> 01:47.190
Ch-ch-ch...

01:47.273 --> 01:52.862
I thought you
told me that Laurie
killed Mouse, right?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.364
-Faye: Laurie?
-Wha--

01:55.865 --> 01:57.325
I never said that.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.202
What are you
talkin' about?

01:59.285 --> 02:01.037
Yeah, you know, Laurie,

02:01.120 --> 02:05.333
the drug dealer that
lives in the apartment
complex off Kemper.

02:05.416 --> 02:09.337
Yeah, you were
the one that told me
she killed Mouse.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.172
I never said that.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.761
-Yes, you did.
-Custer: What are
you talking about?

02:16.845 --> 02:18.888
-Are you high?
-Faye: You know that
Laurie and those

02:18.972 --> 02:20.348
fucking people,
they scare me.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.058
Why are you trying
to protect them?

02:22.141 --> 02:24.143
I'm not fuckin'
protecting anyone.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.562
What the fuck is this?

02:25.645 --> 02:28.106
-So, you're working for Laurie?
-Custer: Hey, no!

02:28.189 --> 02:30.191
So how about you
just shut the fuck up!

02:30.275 --> 02:35.280
Okay, then why are you
trying to cover up a murder
that she committed?

02:35.363 --> 02:37.907
-(nervous laughter)
-Fezco: All right, now.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.410
Think it's time
for you to get outta
here, big fella.

02:40.493 --> 02:44.163
Bro... we gotta figure out
what the fuck we're gonna say.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.958
-Okay, this is becoming
a fucking issue.
-Wait, Ash. Ash, Ash!

02:47.041 --> 02:48.126
No!

02:48.209 --> 02:49.919
(Custer wheezing)

02:53.006 --> 02:54.215
(grunting)

02:54.841 --> 02:56.217
(wheezing)

03:00.597 --> 03:02.724
(Custer grunting)

03:12.275 --> 03:14.110
(choking)

03:21.326 --> 03:23.161
(grunting)

03:27.332 --> 03:29.417
(gagging, choking)

03:55.234 --> 03:57.362
Lexi:
Do you ever think
about the future?

03:57.445 --> 04:00.073
-Fezco: (on phone)
Yeah, all the time.
-Really?

04:00.156 --> 04:01.950
Fezco: Yeah.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.409
Lexi: (on phone)
Like you have a plan?

04:03.493 --> 04:06.829
I mean, I don't, I don't got,
like, a plan-plan,

04:06.913 --> 04:09.207
but I be thinking about

04:09.290 --> 04:12.335
living on a farm, you know?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.045
I don't really
see you as a farmer.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.505
Fezco:
Yeah, fuck it.

04:15.588 --> 04:19.634
Get some horses, cows,
pigs, chickens, goats.

04:19.717 --> 04:21.386
Have a little family.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.349
Like some "Little House
on the Prairie"-type shit.
You know?

04:26.432 --> 04:28.101
I don't know
if I know that show.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.145
Fezco:
You never heard of "Little
House on the Prairie"?

04:31.229 --> 04:33.022
Lexi: Okay, this might
sound kind of crazy but,

04:33.106 --> 04:35.608
my plan is to have,
like, three kids at 30.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.069
Like, each one
a year and a half apart.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.738
So from 30 to 58,
I can focus on,

04:40.822 --> 04:43.908
you know, being a good mom
and raising my kids,
et cetera, et cetera.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.453
And then, drop the last one
off at college at 58.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.664
Which will give me,
like, 32 years

04:49.747 --> 04:52.166
to focus on me
and live my life

04:52.250 --> 04:54.377
and take my time
with writing.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.380
I mean, you really got
this shit all figured out, huh?

04:57.463 --> 05:00.216
Lexi:
Yeah. (laughs)
It's kind of crazy, right?

05:00.299 --> 05:02.510
I mean...

05:02.593 --> 05:05.346
they got, they got
three kids in that show.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.934
There's no need
to forget your manners.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.270
Just because we're
hundreds of miles
from civilized folk.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.772
If you lived in a place
like this, do you think
you'd have a gun?

05:14.856 --> 05:17.233
Fezco:
Hell yeah, I'd own a gun.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.445
I hate guns.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.698
Nobody's ever got shot at
and thought to they-self,

05:23.781 --> 05:29.162
"Whoa! Thank goodness
we didn't have a gun
to shoot back." You know?

05:29.245 --> 05:32.165
Lexi:
Yeah, but then what
are the police for?

05:32.248 --> 05:34.584
Fucked if I know. Shit.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.919
Wait, are you
on Instagram or Twitter?

05:37.003 --> 05:38.421
Fezco:
Hell no.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.591
-Really? Why?
-Oh yeah.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.301
Well, why would
I want anybody

05:43.384 --> 05:45.344
knowin' what I'm
thinkin' or feelin'?

05:45.428 --> 05:46.971
Lexi:
I don't know.
You can connect

05:47.055 --> 05:48.639
with people who have
similar interests.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.433
Fezco: Mmm.
I just feel like people

05:50.516 --> 05:52.602
be sharin' way
too much on there.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.353
-Online?
-Yeah.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.023
They be ruinin'
the mystery, you know?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.358
Like, say if I like a girl,

05:59.442 --> 06:02.904
I wanna find out what she's
about on my own, you know?

06:02.987 --> 06:05.573
I don't wanna google the scraps.

06:05.656 --> 06:08.409
I wanna, I wanna
peel back the layers.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.954
Yeah, but, like, why
would you wanna waste time
getting to know someone...

06:12.038 --> 06:14.207
if you don't have anything
in common with them?

06:14.290 --> 06:16.417
I don't know.
That's what I like

06:16.501 --> 06:18.961
about you the most,
though, like...

06:19.045 --> 06:20.838
we don't really
have nothin' in common.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.423
Lexi:
That's not true.
We both...

06:22.507 --> 06:24.300
have the same sense of humor,

06:24.383 --> 06:28.471
and... are empathic and curious.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.100
And wanna have, like, kids.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.019
Fezco:
Those aren't interests,
you know, those are

06:35.103 --> 06:36.979
real character traits.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.440
It's--
That's the important
shit that, that

06:39.524 --> 06:41.484
people don't post online.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.654
Lexi:
Yeah, I never thought
about it that way.

06:44.737 --> 06:48.658
Fezco:
Well, aren't you glad
that we became friends?

06:48.741 --> 06:51.953
Yeah... very much so.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.873
Yeah, me too.

We're gettin' a lot
of really good laughs.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.819
This is your show.
Come out!

10:11.902 --> 10:14.530
You're the big star

10:14.613 --> 10:16.449

You're the star

I'm not the one

10:32.631 --> 10:35.009

-I didn't do that.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.761

Cassie:
Lexi, I'm going
to fucking kill you.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.713
I deserve this, right?

11:12.797 --> 11:14.965
Because I've actually
lived a life?

11:15.424 --> 11:16.425
Mom?

11:16.509 --> 11:19.303
I'm the one who takes risks.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.596
Student:
Show us your boobs!

11:20.679 --> 11:23.849
I'm the one who falls in love?

11:23.933 --> 11:27.520
I'm the one who gets hurt,
not you, Lexi!

11:27.603 --> 11:29.271
(audience murmuring)

11:29.355 --> 11:33.401
You never even fucking lived!

11:33.484 --> 11:37.446
That's why you're able
to stand up here
and judge all of us!

11:37.530 --> 11:40.241
You're just a fuckin'
bystander.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.076
-Alright, alright--
-Mom, stop!

11:42.159 --> 11:45.329
-Alright!
-(audience booing)

11:46.831 --> 11:49.333
(scoffs) Oh, okay...

11:49.417 --> 11:52.461
Well if that
makes me a villain,

11:52.545 --> 11:55.756
-Whoo!
-Then so fuckin' be it.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.258
(scoffs)

11:57.341 --> 11:59.009
I can play
the fucking villain.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.095
-Student: Yeah, do it!
-(audience booing)

12:01.178 --> 12:03.973
Lexi, is this
the part of the play

12:04.056 --> 12:05.683
where I steal Jake from Marta?

12:05.766 --> 12:07.643
No, Cassie,
that's not in the play.

12:07.726 --> 12:08.727
It is now!

12:08.811 --> 12:10.646
-(audience reacts)
-Who said that?

12:10.729 --> 12:12.440
Look, I wanna say,
I get it.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.858
-Oh god...
-I understand what
you're going through.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.192
-I do not want
to hear from you.
-I lived it.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.153
Wait, Hallie steals
Marta's boyfriend?

12:17.236 --> 12:18.821
I don't know how many times
I have to say this.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.030
They were not
fucking together.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.157
Yeah, not only that,

12:21.240 --> 12:22.908
but she was fucking him
the entire time

12:22.992 --> 12:25.870
Marta was talking about
getting back together with him.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.746
No... Why?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.790
Maddy:
Because Hallie
is a two-faced cunt.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.959

actually saying is that
you gotta give it a reason.

this shit a reason.

53:44.763 --> 53:46.389

wakes up every day

"I'm gonna be better for her.

53:50.393 --> 53:52.354
I'm gonna be there for her."

53:59.110 --> 54:00.862

for too much of it.

59:22.350 --> 59:24.269
And I hope she forgives me.

59:29.190 --> 59:32.568
I stayed clean through
the rest of the school year.

59:32.652 --> 59:35.989
I wish I could say that
was a decision I made.

59:36.072 --> 59:38.616

it was just easier.

will last forever...

59:45.290 --> 59:47.000

59:54.549 --> 59:57.468
"The thought of maybe
being a good person,

59:57.552 --> 1:00:00.430
is what keeps me trying
to be a good person."

1:00:02.849 --> 1:00:05.143
Maybe there's
something to that.
