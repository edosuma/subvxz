You got this!

(BEEPING)

00:36.246 --> 00:39.415
Hal needed an off-road vacay,
and you're a Green Lantern.

00:39.499 --> 00:42.085
He asked you to cover his shift
at the Hall of Justice, no biggie.

00:42.168 --> 00:43.378
You are calm, collected, and in control.

Shush, you! I don't remember
Hal's Ring talking back to him.

00:53.846 --> 00:58.393
<i>That's because Green Lantern Jordan
had accumulated enough Lantern points</i>

00:58.476 --> 01:00.687

<i>You, however,
Green Lantern Jessica Cruz, have not!</i>

01:06.526 --> 01:09.612
- Looks like trouble.
- Oh, hi, Justice League.

01:09.696 --> 01:11.906
Uh, I didn't touch it.
I mean, I was going to touch it,

01:11.990 --> 01:14.075
but I didn't touch it,
so it isn't my fault, I swear!

01:14.158 --> 01:16.202
And everyone is looking at me,
and I should shut up now!

01:16.286 --> 01:19.289

- What for?

01:19.372 --> 01:22.542
- <i>Don't make excuses.</i>
- Not to worry, Green Lantern.

01:22.625 --> 01:26.212
You didn't do anything wrong.
This is the trouble alert.

01:26.296 --> 01:28.965
- It alerts us when...
- When there's trouble?

01:29.048 --> 01:31.801
Yes, see? You're a natural at this.

It seems trouble is exactly what we've got.

01:38.725 --> 01:41.352
And it starts with a capital "L."

01:41.436 --> 01:45.857
Well, Lois is many things, Batman,
but I wouldn't call her trouble.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.817
Not Lois, Superman. Look!

01:47.900 --> 01:50.945
This is Lois Lane
reporting from Area 52 at Dread Lake,

01:51.029 --> 01:54.699
where the intergalactic bounty hunter
known as Lobo is on a rampage.

This is like looking for a Denebian needle
in an Alterian haystack creature. (GROANS)

02:05.209 --> 02:08.755
The now-defunct Area 52 facility
was an attempt to streamline

02:08.838 --> 02:12.425
the military's overly complex
secret alien technology department.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.802
Defunct? I thought
they just built that thing.

02:14.886 --> 02:18.139
The simplification program
made things much more complicated.

02:18.222 --> 02:21.517
They moved everything
to a warehouse in Rebirth, New Jersey.

02:23.353 --> 02:24.437

02:25.521 --> 02:29.692
Where are you, you little

Lobo, a Czarnian who is
super strong, super tough,

02:33.279 --> 02:36.908
and has a super potty mouth,
appears to be in search of something.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.702
There's no telling what
dangerous artifact Lobo will discover.

02:39.786 --> 02:41.496
We need to get to Dread Lake fast.

02:41.579 --> 02:43.122
AQUAMAN: <i>Did someone say "Lake"?</i>

02:43.206 --> 02:46.376
<i>Why, that sounds like a job for Aquaman!</i>

02:46.751 --> 02:49.504
Aquaman, you should know that
Dread Lake isn't really your...

02:49.587 --> 02:52.340
<i>Whoa. Sorry. Reception
down here is a little spotty.</i>

(SIGHS)

02:56.969 --> 03:01.265
Evidently, he did not get my memo
about building an undersea cell tower.

03:01.766 --> 03:04.727
We really should build
an undersea cell tower down here.

03:04.811 --> 03:06.604
The reception is horrible, Orm.

03:06.688 --> 03:11.150
I told you, brother,
I prefer to be called "Ocean Master".

03:11.234 --> 03:14.153
Oh, sorry, Ocean Master.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.281
Don't worry, I'll call you whatever you want.

03:17.573 --> 03:22.495
Oh. There she is. The Aquajet!

03:22.912 --> 03:25.164
We just detailed it for you, sire.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.750
And a wonderful job you did, too.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.546
You guys are great.
I love being the king of you.

03:31.629 --> 03:35.425
I almost feel bad about taking it
up to the dusty old surface world.

03:35.508 --> 03:39.387
No, no, no. Go! You're needed up there.

03:39.470 --> 03:43.891
I'll take care of everything
down here while you're gone. Again.

03:46.811 --> 03:48.062
Thanks, Ormi!

03:48.229 --> 03:51.149
- It's "Ocean Master".
- Right. Right, right.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.401
Although, kind of a weird nickname,

03:53.484 --> 03:56.279
seeing as I am
the King of the Seven Seas and all.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.072
But, uh, whatever.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.908
I'm just glad
we can move beyond our petty squabbles,

04:00.992 --> 04:04.203
and work to help Atlantis, nay, the world!

"Black is the new black!"

12:16.362 --> 12:20.115
Aquaman's ability to talk to sea life
is a critical skill.

12:20.199 --> 12:23.202
One that I'm sure
he'll use with great effectiveness,

12:23.410 --> 12:26.538
sometime in the future,
when it becomes necessary.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.540
There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.

12:28.624 --> 12:31.460
Aquaman's teammates
are 100% supportive of him,

12:31.543 --> 12:34.672
despite his overly specialized powers.

12:34.755 --> 12:38.300
For the <i>Daily Planet,</i>
Lois Lane is signing off.

12:38.384 --> 12:42.471
Cut! Great stuff. Let's get back home
and run this on tonight's seven o'clock.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.390
I wouldn't worry about it, Aquaman.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.059
Not many people watch network news anymore.

12:47.142 --> 12:50.938
Oh, I'm not worried.
Besides, we don't get cable in Atlantis.

12:51.063 --> 12:54.650
I'm just excited we're finally all together.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.444
How about we go somewhere
to feast and celebrate?

12:57.528 --> 13:01.782
Or, or... Or we figure out
why Lobo was here in the first place.

13:02.992 --> 13:04.785
Nothing says celebration like apple pie.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.537
I can make you an ambrosia to make
the gods weep!

13:06.620 --> 13:08.038
Let's hit Big Belly Burger!

13:08.289 --> 13:12.167
Allow me to cordially
invite you all to Atlantis!

13:12.251 --> 13:17.172
Where we shall celebrate my anniversary
as King of the Seven Seas!

13:17.339 --> 13:21.010
We're going to Atlantis. That is so awesome!

13:21.093 --> 13:24.179
Road trip under the sea! I love the sea!

13:24.263 --> 13:28.684

Home to the most interesting
forms of life known to man.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.828
Outside of you guys, I mean. (CHUCKLES)

13:48.620 --> 13:50.539
Oh! Fishies!

13:50.622 --> 13:54.710
Yes, fish, plants.
We have everything down here.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.211
Even froyo?

13:56.295 --> 13:59.631
Well, no, that melts in the seawater,
but we have colorful rocks.

13:59.715 --> 14:03.344
And, uh, uh... Coral! We have coral.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.512
Aren't coral and rocks the same thing?

14:05.596 --> 14:08.891
(LAUGHS)

14:08.974 --> 14:10.100
Hardly.

14:10.184 --> 14:12.519
Is it me, or is the water changing color?

14:12.686 --> 14:16.273
Good observation, Cyborg.
Red and yellow wavelengths of light

14:16.357 --> 14:18.525
can only travel so far underwater,

14:18.609 --> 14:21.820
which is why everything
looks blue and green at these depths.

14:22.488 --> 14:26.492
Oh, that lack of solar energy
is making me feel a little green.

14:26.575 --> 14:32.706
I've got the cure for
your super seasickness here in Atlantis!

14:39.380 --> 14:41.090
Beautiful.

14:42.257 --> 14:46.095
What's that noise?
Oh, sorry, it sounds like singing.

14:46.178 --> 14:49.390
Oh, that must be my song of arrival.

14:49.473 --> 14:53.477
My people always like to sing
a little ditty when I'm returning home.

14:53.560 --> 14:58.148

Who's that guy? Looks important.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.309
AQUAMAN: King Poseidon.

15:34.435 --> 15:37.813
In his hand is the mystical Trident of Hope.

15:38.021 --> 15:42.276
Legend states that whosoever pulls
the Trident from the statue's hand,

15:42.359 --> 15:45.571
is the rightful ruler of Atlantis.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.948
- Just like Excalibur!
- "Ex" what now?

15:48.115 --> 15:49.783
JESSICA: Has anyone been able to do it?

15:49.867 --> 15:52.411
AQUAMAN: No, it's just an old wives' tale,

15:52.494 --> 15:56.623
although the younglings can be seen
trying to pull it out from time to time.

15:56.707 --> 15:57.916

16:08.552 --> 16:10.888
Uh, question. How are we gonna
breathe down here?

16:11.054 --> 16:13.599
I've developed a special Bat aqua spray

16:13.682 --> 16:16.810

Aren't we all the same size, Cyborg?

16:50.761 --> 16:53.805
This is my wife, Mera.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.391
Wait, you're married?

16:57.226 --> 17:01.772
I mean, of course, you're married.
Aquaman talks about you all the time.

17:01.855 --> 17:05.567
Well, I'm sorry I haven't had a chance
to meet you all in person.

I've been busy perfecting my craft
while Arthur has been away.

17:09.238 --> 17:10.906

- Yes.

Not only is Mera the Queen of Atlantis,

17:13.617 --> 17:17.663
she's also a master conjuror of hard water.

- Oh, no, no. It's better.

Argh!

24:36.601 --> 24:37.727
Who is Atrocitus?

24:37.811 --> 24:41.064
<i>Atrocitus, leader of the Red Lantern Corps.</i>

24:41.147 --> 24:44.776
<i>They have the ability to enslave minds
with the power of rage.</i>

24:44.859 --> 24:47.278
<i>I suggest leaving, quickly.</i>

24:47.404 --> 24:49.239
Hal spoke of the Red Lanterns.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.867
It's their lantern light that's
infecting the Atlanteans with rage.

24:52.951 --> 24:56.997
Looks like Green Lantern's shield
is protecting us from the red light.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.125

25:04.212 --> 25:07.674
As your new royal adviser,

25:07.757 --> 25:10.260
my first piece of advice is,

25:10.343 --> 25:13.221
destroy the Justice League!

25:13.304 --> 25:15.807
- MAN 1: Destroy them!
- MAN 2: Get them! Get them!

25:15.890 --> 25:16.975
MAN 3: I got the one with the cape!

25:19.102 --> 25:21.062
Get out of that!

RING: <i>Very little.</i>

25:25.859 --> 25:28.361
It somehow doesn't feel right
to just start punching them.

25:28.445 --> 25:32.699
We cannot. I may not be their king,
but they are still my people.

25:32.782 --> 25:35.118
We must retreat and form a plan.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.038
I know a way out, but we need a distraction.

25:38.121 --> 25:43.793
Well, lucky for you, my super useful
Utility Belt has just the thing.

25:56.848 --> 25:59.476
You've done well, Ocean Master.

25:59.559 --> 26:02.604
You mean "King Ocean Master."

26:02.687 --> 26:05.565
Yes, of course, Your Majesty.

26:05.648 --> 26:08.109
My plan to infect the Atlanteans

26:08.193 --> 26:11.696

seems to have worked.

26:11.780 --> 26:17.160
At last, all of Atlantis bows to me!

26:17.243 --> 26:20.371
And now begins Stage Two.

be able to get out before they stop us.

26:32.092 --> 26:34.511
How? I'm sure they have
the palace surrounded.

26:34.594 --> 26:37.305
- The Sea Gate, of course.
- The "Sea" what now?

26:38.264 --> 26:39.557
Behold!

26:43.686 --> 26:46.189
What is that?

26:46.272 --> 26:48.608
That is the Sea Gate.

26:48.983 --> 26:51.111
It can open an interdimensional portal

26:51.194 --> 26:55.323
between Atlantis and other aquatic
planets throughout the universe!

26:55.406 --> 27:00.370
Oh, I wasn't aware that
Atlantean technology was so advanced.

27:04.749 --> 27:07.127
Aquaman, there must be something you can do.

27:07.210 --> 27:09.504
Well, I don't know
how to change the location,

27:09.629 --> 27:12.382

you won't have a people to save.

there are more people on the other side,

We'll have to go back and get her.

- It could go either way.
- Of course.

of rage-fueled battle machines to Earth.

Impossible! The Sea Gate isn't designed
to be able to transport an army!

is available to... Well, anyone.

That's what's powering the Gate!

Now, Atrocitus can use Atlantis as
a beachhead to attack the surface world.

Didn't you say the Sea Gate
went to other water-covered worlds?

01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:06.797
(GROWLS)

01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:11.177
Enough parlor tricks! Prepare for doom!

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.262
(GROWLS)

01:06:13.345 --> 01:06:14.680
For Atlantis!

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:21.145
For the world!

01:06:39.288 --> 01:06:41.540
No!

01:06:44.043 --> 01:06:45.920
(GROWLS) Huh?

01:06:58.516 --> 01:07:02.019
Now it is finally over, Atrocitus!

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:06.732
For your world. Unfortunately for you,

01:07:06.815 --> 01:07:10.194
the SLURP has already been activated,
and cannot be stopped.

01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:14.448
All your precious water
is about to be sucked into oblivion.

01:07:14.823 --> 01:07:16.742
There has to be a way to stop it.

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:21.914
If there is, I'm sure you could find it.
Go! I'll restrain Atrocitus.

01:07:21.997 --> 01:07:25.334
You have a world to save, my King.

01:07:33.425 --> 01:07:36.428
Ocean Master, let us...

01:07:37.346 --> 01:07:39.974
I think we've heard enough from you!

01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:45.813
This is Lois Lane reporting live from
above the water just outside Star City,

01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:49.858
where a giant slurping device
is dropping the ocean's water level

01:07:49.942 --> 01:07:51.485
at an incredible speed.

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:55.406
So far, the Justice League seem
to be unable to dismantle the device.

01:07:56.365 --> 01:07:58.701
(BOTH GRUNT)

01:07:58.784 --> 01:08:01.870
It's no good. Not even
my heat vision can penetrate it.

01:08:04.456 --> 01:08:07.209
- (GRUNTS)
- What are we gonna do?

01:08:07.418 --> 01:08:09.378
I wish Arthur was here.

01:08:12.423 --> 01:08:14.216
Arthur! You're okay!

01:08:14.425 --> 01:08:17.803
I'm fine, Mera. It's good to see you.

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:20.848
I'm sorry for the things I said.
I didn't mean it.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.475
No, Mera. I apologize.

01:08:23.559 --> 01:08:26.895
I didn't think about how
losing the throne would affect you.

01:08:27.062 --> 01:08:32.943
You're my wife, my queen.
We rule Atlantis together.

01:08:34.737 --> 01:08:38.866
Now, I believe it's time to save the planet!

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.076
I share your sentiments, Aquaman.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.580
Unfortunately, our weapons
are ineffective against this SLURP.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:48.042
By themselves, perhaps,
but we can't give up yet.

01:08:48.542 --> 01:08:53.005
If we concentrate everything we have
on a solitary point at the same time,

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:56.341
then maybe we have a chance. Who's with me?

01:08:56.425 --> 01:08:57.635

01:08:57.718 --> 01:09:00.638
BATMAN: I'm cheering for once.
Hurray, or something.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.557
Ready, Justice League?

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.850
Now!

Fishy's right. We don't have enough power!

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.843
We need something more!

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.767
How about some more of the Main Man?

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:48.727
I'm back, baby!

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.150
Whoo! (LAUGHS)

(STRAINING)

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:53.041
It looks like the Justice League,
led by Aquaman,

01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:55.836
have destroyed the device and saved the day!

01:10:56.837 --> 01:10:59.506
She's right, you know.
You did lead us to victory.

01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:02.843
I'd say it was more of a team effort.

01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:07.806
(FISHY SQUEAKING)

01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:14.313
ORM: My good citizens of Atlantis,

01:11:14.438 --> 01:11:16.857
I have done you a great disservice

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:20.611
by saying the law prevents
Aquaman from being King.

01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:24.031
In fact, the fine print was
something I put in there

01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:27.576
with the help of a clerk named Sal
at an all-night copy center.

01:11:27.743 --> 01:11:30.537
- There is no such law.
- MAN: Get off the stage!

01:11:30.621 --> 01:11:33.373
And even if there were,
we can see he is worthy,

01:11:33.457 --> 01:11:37.711
because he pulled the Trident
of Poseidon from the great statue.

01:11:37.795 --> 01:11:41.340
So, Aquaman, my brother,

01:11:41.423 --> 01:11:45.219
I give you back the crown
you so richly deserve.

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:46.595

best king and the best hero I can be,

Wow. You Atlanteans really
know how to throw a party.

01:12:32.891 --> 01:12:34.726
Thank you, Cyborg.

01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:37.271
Well, I'm glad everything turned out okay.

01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:40.691
But what are we gonna do about the
Red Lanterns, Dex-Starr and Atrocitus?

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:44.278
- Leave them to me and Fishy.
- (SQUEAKS)

Turns out Oa placed a bounty on their heads,

01:12:46.989 --> 01:12:48.949
and I'm meaning to collect.

Yeah, but let's not get mushy.

Did someone say
high-altitude snowy mountains,

01:13:25.277 --> 01:13:28.113
nowhere near any ocean or body of water?
