00:14.201 --> 00:15.731
Did we lose them?

00:15.799 --> 00:17.663
I think so.

00:20.660 --> 00:24.057
Those bees were more relentless
than the Dragon Corps.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.621
A lot of work
for so little reward.

00:29.820 --> 00:32.253
Oh, that's not enough for two.
You take it.

00:32.319 --> 00:34.850
No. You.

00:34.918 --> 00:36.183
I insist.

00:36.249 --> 00:38.381
But you did all the work.

00:38.449 --> 00:39.914
I'll eat at the next
tavern we pass.

00:39.982 --> 00:42.878
It can't be far.
Come on.

00:42.946 --> 00:44.711
Which direction
are we headed, anyway?

00:44.779 --> 00:46.044
East.

00:46.112 --> 00:47.942
East?
Towards the D'Haran border?

00:48.010 --> 00:50.340
To Caddock, to be precise.

00:50.408 --> 00:52.007
Ah, breakfast. I'm starving.

00:55.339 --> 00:56.972
I spoke with a friend
in the resistance

00:57.040 --> 00:59.070
while I was getting supplies.

00:59.138 --> 01:01.567
It seems King Gregor
is facing a new enemy

01:01.635 --> 01:03.601
and has requested
the Seeker's help.

01:03.669 --> 01:05.200
King Gregor?

01:05.268 --> 01:06.966
His kingdom borders D'Hara.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.031
He's a strong ally
of the resistance.

01:09.099 --> 01:10.398
One of the few leaders
brave enough

01:10.466 --> 01:11.964
to stand against
Darken Rahl.

01:12.031 --> 01:13.896
Apparently, he's done
better than that.

01:13.964 --> 01:17.095
Our friend says the king
has driven back the D'Harans.

01:17.163 --> 01:19.161
They've pulled their troops
away from the border.

01:19.228 --> 01:20.795
Well, why does he need our help?

01:20.863 --> 01:23.994
What could be a bigger threat
than the D'Harans?

02:20.774 --> 02:22.773
The Caddock border
shouldn't be much further.

02:39.740 --> 02:41.072
Stop where you are!

02:48.573 --> 02:50.039
Guards, lower your weapons.

02:50.107 --> 02:53.306
Unless I'm mistaken,
this is Richard Cypher.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.040
The Seeker.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.041
I'm Marius,
brother of King Gregor.

02:57.108 --> 02:58.774
Thank the Spirits
you received my message.

03:01.909 --> 03:03.876
We came as quickly as we could.

03:03.944 --> 03:05.775
Wizard Zorander.
Confessor.

03:05.843 --> 03:07.943
It's an honor.

03:08.011 --> 03:10.745
This is Flynne,
Captain of the Guard.

03:10.813 --> 03:12.213
Forgive the rude welcome.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.248
All our nerves
are a little frayed lately.

03:15.315 --> 03:18.018
Would that have anything to do
with why you asked us to come?

03:18.085 --> 03:21.685
It's best if you hear that
from the king himself.

03:21.753 --> 03:24.153
Thank you
for coming so quickly.

03:24.221 --> 03:27.822
It pains me to delay you on your
mission to defeat Darken Rahl.

03:27.889 --> 03:32.424
Helping those who stand against
Rahl is part of that mission.

03:32.492 --> 03:37.027
My kingdom is being terrorized
by a vicious beast

03:37.095 --> 03:39.294
that's ravaging
our countryside

03:39.362 --> 03:43.427
and I need your help
to destroy this monster.

03:43.495 --> 03:45.930
Tell me where
to find this beast.

03:48.630 --> 03:50.131
You already have.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.764
It's me.

03:56.934 --> 03:59.699
Five months ago the D'Harans
began amassing troops

03:59.766 --> 04:02.366
along this border. From there,
Rahl's soldiers launched

04:02.433 --> 04:04.134
raids on our farmland,
burnt our crops.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.401
With our food stocks dwindling,

04:06.469 --> 04:08.034
Rahl knew we couldn't
repel a siege.

04:08.101 --> 04:09.535
An invasion was imminent.

04:09.602 --> 04:13.967
I had no choice but to seek
an alliance with our neighbor.

04:14.035 --> 04:17.301
Here, in Agaden Reach.

04:17.369 --> 04:20.666
The domain of that
she-devil Shota.

04:20.735 --> 04:22.235
Forgive me, Your Majesty,

04:22.303 --> 04:23.935
but why would you
seek an alliance

04:24.002 --> 04:25.569
with someone
as dangerous as Shota?

04:25.636 --> 04:28.200
The witch-woman has the ability
to see the future.

04:30.134 --> 04:32.902
I was hoping she would
help us change it.

04:32.969 --> 04:37.465
I reminded Shota that our
kingdom was all that separated

04:37.533 --> 04:40.765
her from Rahl's tightening grip.

04:40.833 --> 04:42.730
That if Caddock were overrun,

04:42.798 --> 04:45.064
Agaden Reach would soon follow.

04:45.130 --> 04:48.032
So I struck a bargain with her.

04:48.100 --> 04:51.195
In exchange for my pledge
to defend her,

04:51.263 --> 04:52.728
she promised
to give me the power

04:52.796 --> 04:54.426
to protect my kingdom forever.

04:54.494 --> 04:58.326
And how exactly did she do that?

05:00.193 --> 05:02.859
She cursed me.

05:02.927 --> 05:08.157
Each night, I would
be transformed into a Calthrop.

05:14.792 --> 05:18.123
An awful beast that haunts
the nightmares of all D'Harans.

05:19.356 --> 05:22.256
The Calthrop is one
of the few things

05:22.324 --> 05:23.889
D'Haran children
are taught to fear.

05:23.956 --> 05:26.488
For centuries,
they've frightened each other

05:26.556 --> 05:30.155
around campfires with tales
of the creature's bloodlust.

05:30.223 --> 05:31.889
For weeks I ventured close

05:31.957 --> 05:33.555
to the D'Haran camps.

05:33.623 --> 05:36.555
At nightfall,
I would become the creature.

05:36.623 --> 05:39.288
The few who survived
the slaughter

05:39.356 --> 05:41.787
fled back to D'Hara,

05:41.855 --> 05:43.688
spreading stories
of the brutal Calthrop

05:43.755 --> 05:45.821
that stalked the forest
around Caddock.

05:45.889 --> 05:47.786
Soon Rahl's forces were

05:47.853 --> 05:50.085
too terrified to cross
into our kingdom.

05:50.153 --> 05:52.885
With morale suffering
and his troops stretched thin,

05:52.952 --> 05:55.649
Rahl abandoned his attempt
to conquer us.

05:55.716 --> 05:56.982
Once the D'Haran troops

05:57.049 --> 05:59.247
pulled away from our border,

05:59.314 --> 06:03.014
her to remove the curse.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.177
I couldn't risk
butchering my own people.

06:05.244 --> 06:07.776
But she refused.

06:07.843 --> 06:11.276
And once the Calthrop's hunger
couldn't be quenched,

06:11.343 --> 06:13.408
I had my most loyal men,

06:13.476 --> 06:15.607
all sworn to secrecy,

06:15.675 --> 06:18.272
chain me in the woods,

06:18.340 --> 06:21.403
but the beast broke through
the chains and killed them all.

06:24.037 --> 06:29.862
I then spent half my treasury
on purchasing this:

06:29.929 --> 06:31.660
A rada'han.

06:31.728 --> 06:34.257
I'd hoped its ability
to suppress magic

06:34.324 --> 06:36.823
would be enough
to overcome Shota's curse.

06:38.421 --> 06:40.685
I locked the rada'han
around my brother's neck.

06:40.753 --> 06:42.982
Yet he still transformed
and somehow managed to escape.

06:43.048 --> 06:45.880
I was too ashamed

06:45.947 --> 06:51.272
to have my people know that
their king was the Calthrop.

06:51.340 --> 06:53.070
So now each night

06:53.137 --> 06:55.801
I head to the most remote part
of the forest,

06:55.869 --> 06:58.162
a place called Knollwood Grove.

06:58.230 --> 07:00.195
Anyone venturing into the woods

07:00.263 --> 07:03.525
after dark rarely
makes it out alive.

07:03.593 --> 07:08.053
I have no memory
of these attacks,

07:08.121 --> 07:13.047
but each morning I awake with
the taste of blood on my tongue.

07:15.311 --> 07:16.709
Three days ago,

07:16.777 --> 07:20.736
I awoke to find the savaged
remains of my latest victim.

07:20.804 --> 07:22.867
The face staring
back at me was...

07:25.663 --> 07:27.027
...that of my own wife.

07:28.990 --> 07:34.016
<i>I had murdered</i>
<i>my beloved queen.</i>

07:39.176 --> 07:41.073
It's not your fault, brother.

07:41.141 --> 07:43.236
You were only trying
to protect your kingdom.

07:43.304 --> 07:47.533
And now the kingdom
must be protected from me.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.895
I've tried to end my life.

07:49.963 --> 07:54.125
Poison, hanging,
a dagger to my heart.

07:54.193 --> 07:56.222
But you can't be killed,

07:56.289 --> 07:59.653
because Shota gave you exactly
what you asked for:

07:59.721 --> 08:04.045
the power to protect
your kingdom forever.

08:04.112 --> 08:05.745
Your Majesty,

08:05.813 --> 08:08.106
what makes you think
I can help you?

08:08.174 --> 08:10.338
According to legend,

08:10.406 --> 08:12.336
the only thing that
can kill a Calthrop

08:12.403 --> 08:13.898
is the Sword of Truth.

08:19.592 --> 08:21.420
Can't you lift the curse?

08:21.488 --> 08:23.017
Only the one who
made it can break it.

08:23.085 --> 08:28.312
I'll go to Agaden Reach
and try to reason with Shota.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.778
Are you sure?

08:29.844 --> 08:31.973
Few who have gone there
have ever returned.

08:32.041 --> 08:34.470
I know.

08:34.538 --> 08:36.436
I'm one of those few.

08:36.503 --> 08:38.265
And if you fail?

08:38.332 --> 08:41.364
What then?

08:41.431 --> 08:42.696
I can't bear the thought

08:42.764 --> 08:44.923
of killing another
innocent person.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.589
While Zedd is gone,
I'll watch over you

08:46.657 --> 08:48.187
and keep you from
harming anyone.

08:48.255 --> 08:50.320
How? The monster can

08:50.387 --> 08:51.917
break through
our strongest chains.

08:51.985 --> 08:58.411
I may have a few tricks
that your blacksmith doesn't.

09:01.441 --> 09:04.272
When the evening bell chimes,
I will come find you, Seeker.

09:04.339 --> 09:05.834
Your Highness,
I'm coming with you.

09:05.902 --> 09:09.930
Forgive me, but I've already
harmed too many people.

09:09.998 --> 09:12.061
I couldn't bear to add

09:12.128 --> 09:14.125
the Mother Confessor
to that toll.

09:14.193 --> 09:15.324
Father?

09:16.855 --> 09:19.917
This is Princess Corah,
my daughter.

09:19.985 --> 09:21.780
We're honored to have
the Seeker here in Caddock.

09:23.482 --> 09:26.408
Our people have lived
in fear for so long.

09:26.476 --> 09:29.269
We were very sorry to hear
about your mother, princess.

09:30.933 --> 09:33.628
Just promise me

09:33.695 --> 09:36.753
you'll find the horrible beast
that murdered my mother

09:36.821 --> 09:39.748
and you'll kill it.

09:48.573 --> 09:51.502
You're sure these
chains will hold?

09:51.570 --> 09:54.164
Zedd's magic has made
them unbreakable.

09:54.231 --> 09:56.260
I hope you're right, Seeker.

09:56.328 --> 09:57.991
But swear to me.

09:58.058 --> 10:02.586
If it's a question of my life
or yours, you'll kill me.

10:04.019 --> 10:06.381
I swear.

10:06.449 --> 10:08.111
But we'll make sure
it doesn't come to that.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.638
As much as I enjoy
your company, Seeker,

10:12.706 --> 10:15.302
you can't watch over me
every night.

10:15.370 --> 10:17.134
I just have to do it until Zedd

10:17.202 --> 10:19.129
can convince Shota
to lift the curse.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.152
I've been expecting you,
Zeddicus.

10:35.220 --> 10:37.683
Then you know why I've come.

10:39.351 --> 10:41.614
I can't imagine it's to
apologize for scorning me.

10:43.747 --> 10:46.877
I was once a foolish,
young Wizard, I--

10:46.945 --> 10:48.176
I never meant to hurt you.

10:48.243 --> 10:50.409
And yet you left,

10:50.477 --> 10:54.105
without a word
of explanation.

10:54.173 --> 10:56.903
Those words may
have been my last.

10:59.338 --> 11:01.868
I showed you our
future together.

11:01.936 --> 11:04.697
With our combined powers,
we could have moved mountains.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.863
Our children would have ruled
for a thousand generations.

11:12.361 --> 11:14.394
And now look at you, Zeddicus,

11:14.462 --> 11:18.393
reduced to crawling back,
begging me for a favor.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.991
Why should I do
anything for you?

11:24.059 --> 11:25.589
Not for me.

11:25.657 --> 11:29.221
For King Gregor, with whom
you share a common enemy.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.720
He's beaten back
the D'Harans

11:31.788 --> 11:34.053
and insured the safety
of his lands and yours.

11:34.121 --> 11:37.919
The king killing his own people
doesn't benefit you at all.

11:37.986 --> 11:40.616
Release him from the curse.

11:40.684 --> 11:43.882
Put an end to this
pointless bloodshed.

11:56.413 --> 11:59.773
Without the Calthrop,
this is what will come to pass.

12:18.436 --> 12:20.068
What I bestowed
on King Gregor,

12:20.136 --> 12:22.201
it's not a curse, Zeddicus.

12:24.068 --> 12:25.765
It's a blessing.

12:31.294 --> 12:32.460
I met your mother once.

12:32.528 --> 12:33.727
You did?

12:33.795 --> 12:35.393
She visited Aydindril

12:35.461 --> 12:38.459
when I was a young Confessor.

12:38.527 --> 12:39.859
She was very kind to me.

12:42.158 --> 12:44.090
I can see the resemblance.

12:45.957 --> 12:47.724
I still can't
believe she's gone.

12:50.022 --> 12:52.621
I lost my mother
when I was very young.

12:52.689 --> 12:56.421
I know how painful it can be.

12:56.488 --> 12:59.718
It would be easier if I knew
why she left the castle.

12:59.786 --> 13:02.316
What she was doing out there
the night she died.

13:02.383 --> 13:03.883
Princess Corah.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.581
What is it, Duncan?

13:05.648 --> 13:06.913
Where's Helena?

13:06.981 --> 13:10.512
We took a wagon to fetch
her family, as you asked,

13:10.580 --> 13:12.480
when we were passing
through Knollwood Grove

13:12.547 --> 13:14.444
our horse was bit
by a snake vine.

13:14.512 --> 13:17.174
I ran back here as fast
as I could to get another horse.

13:17.241 --> 13:18.741
They're still
at Knollwood Grove?

13:18.809 --> 13:21.872
That's one of the beast's
hunting grounds.

13:21.938 --> 13:23.604
It's almost sundown.
No one's allowed

13:23.671 --> 13:26.065
to leave the castle.
- But there are children out there.

13:26.133 --> 13:28.364
Just tell me where to find them,
and I'll bring them back.

13:28.432 --> 13:29.430
I'm going with you.

13:29.497 --> 13:31.459
No, it's too dangerous.

13:31.527 --> 13:32.826
I'm the one who
put them in danger.

13:32.891 --> 13:34.255
With the Calthrop loose,

13:34.322 --> 13:36.153
my lady-in-waiting
worried about her family.

13:36.221 --> 13:37.784
I sent her to go get them.

13:37.852 --> 13:39.781
Putting yourself in danger
won't help them.

13:39.849 --> 13:41.111
No, it'll help you.

13:41.179 --> 13:42.975
We can move faster
if I show you the way.

14:02.683 --> 14:03.648
It's started.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.170
Please, Seeker,

14:10.237 --> 14:12.301
don't let me hurt anyone else.

14:46.557 --> 14:48.751
Stay back!
I don't want to hurt you.

15:08.230 --> 15:09.928
It's all right, little ones.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.359
We'll be on our way soon.

16:32.108 --> 16:33.538
Hey!

16:34.938 --> 16:36.632
Corah, no.

16:42.025 --> 16:44.020
Run!

16:50.943 --> 16:52.806
Take the children. Run!

16:58.662 --> 16:59.792
Kill it!

17:04.251 --> 17:05.813
Richard!

17:43.050 --> 17:44.445
Kahlan.

17:44.513 --> 17:46.541
Kahlan, are you all right?

17:50.736 --> 17:52.799
Kahlan, stop. Kahlan, stop!

17:52.866 --> 17:56.459
Kahlan, it's me, Richard.

17:56.527 --> 18:00.888
Kahlan, it's me.
It's me, Richard.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.484
Stop.

18:09.042 --> 18:10.737
It's okay.

18:18.692 --> 18:21.187
Are you all right?

18:21.255 --> 18:23.218
I think so.

18:23.286 --> 18:25.047
Now that that beast is dead.

18:37.427 --> 18:39.457
Father?

18:49.154 --> 18:52.512
The Calthrop wasn't the only
monster out there last night.

18:54.511 --> 18:57.675
That's the second time
I've gone into the Con Dar

18:57.743 --> 19:00.007
and I still don't
have control over it.

19:00.074 --> 19:03.300
The first time
I almost destroyed you,

19:03.368 --> 19:06.066
and last night
I almost destroyed Corah.

19:06.133 --> 19:07.361
But you didn't.

19:07.429 --> 19:11.291
Only because you stopped me.

19:11.359 --> 19:15.589
Once it gets a hold of me,
it's like I'm some wild animal.

19:15.657 --> 19:16.989
I don't know what I'm doing.

19:17.057 --> 19:20.586
You were trying to protect
me from the Calthrop.

19:20.653 --> 19:22.785
If my mother were alive,

19:22.852 --> 19:24.118
she could teach me
to control it.

19:26.416 --> 19:29.115
But on my own,

19:29.183 --> 19:32.411
it's only a matter of time
before I hurt someone.

19:32.479 --> 19:33.744
Someone I care about.

19:33.812 --> 19:35.109
Richard.

19:35.177 --> 19:36.210
Kahlan.

19:38.175 --> 19:40.237
We killed the Calthrop.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.903
Yes, I heard.

19:41.971 --> 19:43.302
And that's the problem.

19:43.369 --> 19:45.102
Shota showed me a vision

19:45.169 --> 19:48.298
of what would happen to this
kingdom without the Calthrop.

19:48.366 --> 19:50.165
I saw a D'Haran invasion,

19:50.231 --> 19:53.496
soldiers storming the castle,

19:53.564 --> 19:55.895
and one of their commanders
taking the king's throne.

19:55.963 --> 19:58.193
Well, we know Shota's
visions can be averted.

19:58.259 --> 20:01.691
Yes, but I'm afraid
in order to do that,

20:01.759 --> 20:04.222
we may need Shota
to curse someone else.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.288
The D'Harans will
prepare their invasion

20:06.355 --> 20:09.088
once they learn the Calthrop
has been slain.

20:09.155 --> 20:11.917
As much as the people feared
and hated the beast,

20:11.985 --> 20:14.416
it kept them safe from Rahl.

20:14.484 --> 20:17.548
Then we have to make sure
the D'Harans don't find out.

20:19.615 --> 20:21.645
If we can keep the legend
of the Calthrop alive,

20:21.713 --> 20:24.111
we can keep the D'Harans
from invading.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.709
And spare anyone else the burden
of carrying Shota's curse.

20:26.776 --> 20:28.010
Maybe.

20:28.078 --> 20:30.774
But how long could
we keep up such a ruse?

20:30.842 --> 20:32.742
Long enough for me
to defeat Rahl.

20:45.303 --> 20:49.201
Why didn't my father tell me?

20:49.269 --> 20:51.567
He was trying to protect you.

20:51.634 --> 20:55.297
If my father didn't think I was
strong enough to hear the truth,

20:55.365 --> 20:57.230
how can I lead this kingdom?

20:59.066 --> 21:00.229
I know you can.

21:00.296 --> 21:02.762
But maybe I shouldn't.

21:02.830 --> 21:05.729
Maybe I should ask Marius to
assume the throne in my place.

21:07.263 --> 21:11.693
If you decide it's too much,
no one would fault you.

21:11.760 --> 21:14.158
But if I'm not mistaken,
your mother wasn't much older

21:14.226 --> 21:15.958
than you when she took
the throne.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.757
But she had my father.

21:17.825 --> 21:20.023
And you have both
of them inside you.

21:21.724 --> 21:24.021
I've seen your strength.

21:24.089 --> 21:25.521
You made the decision
to ride out

21:25.589 --> 21:27.152
to save Helena
and her children,

21:27.219 --> 21:30.284
even though you knew
the dangers.

21:30.352 --> 21:31.884
I don't think
your people could ask

21:31.952 --> 21:34.384
for a more courageous leader.

21:39.817 --> 21:41.050
<i>As Queen,</i>

21:41.117 --> 21:43.615
I pledge my fealty
to this great kingdom,

21:43.683 --> 21:45.913
to defend its people
from all enemies,

21:45.981 --> 21:49.177
and lead it into peace
and prosperity.

21:49.245 --> 21:51.110
Spirits, bless our kingdom.

22:07.011 --> 22:10.010
Spirits, bless our Queen.

22:10.077 --> 22:13.209
Spirits, bless our Queen.

22:19.410 --> 22:20.975
The only way
the D'Harans will believe

22:21.043 --> 22:22.276
the Calthrop is still alive

22:22.344 --> 22:23.842
is if there's been
another attack.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.476
My Queen,

22:25.544 --> 22:27.276
Captain Flynne
and I will slaughter sheep

22:27.344 --> 22:29.042
and leave the carcasses
at the border.

22:29.109 --> 22:30.709
We'll spread word
along trade routes.

22:30.777 --> 22:33.210
The D'Harans will believe
it's the work of the Calthrop.

22:33.278 --> 22:36.344
I may have something
that will help those efforts.

22:40.446 --> 22:44.311
that borders D'Hara
and cast a spell on them.

22:44.379 --> 22:46.110
The slightest disturbance
in the air--

22:46.178 --> 22:47.911
Say, from an approaching
D'Haran.

22:47.978 --> 22:50.208
--and the chimes will ring out.

22:50.276 --> 22:52.742
Only it won't be just
any chime they'll hear,

22:52.810 --> 22:55.676
it will be the awful howls
of the Calthrop.

22:55.744 --> 22:59.176
The ear is more easily
frightened than the eye.

23:01.743 --> 23:04.076
We'll make preparations
at once, Your Majesty.

23:09.477 --> 23:10.778
I want to thank you.
I don't know

23:10.846 --> 23:13.277
what I would've done
if you hadn't been here.

23:13.345 --> 23:15.344
If there's anything
I can do for you...

23:17.913 --> 23:20.980
There is one favor you could
grant me, Your Majesty.

23:43.217 --> 23:45.515
Why are you bringing that?

23:45.583 --> 23:47.782
Because I can't trust myself.

23:50.249 --> 23:53.348
I'm used to having control.

23:53.416 --> 23:56.182
Being a Confessor
is about certainty,

23:56.250 --> 23:58.748
about knowing the truth.

23:58.816 --> 24:01.715
When I'm in the Con Dar
I don't have any of that.

24:01.783 --> 24:04.915
The rada'han gives
a little of it back to me.

24:04.983 --> 24:08.181
But we don't even know
if it works.

24:08.249 --> 24:10.514
It didn't stop King Gregor.

24:12.382 --> 24:15.581
It works.

24:15.648 --> 24:18.077
I can feel it suppressing
my power already.

24:21.711 --> 24:25.673
Maybe it's something
that shouldn't surprised.

24:25.741 --> 24:28.436
You said only the most powerful
Confessors have it, right?

24:30.336 --> 24:32.631
Yes.

24:32.699 --> 24:35.528
Then maybe this is a gift.

24:35.596 --> 24:38.356
One you shouldn't deny.

24:38.423 --> 24:40.788
It's a part
of who you are.

24:46.779 --> 24:49.706
When I'm in the Con Dar,
I don't know who that is.

24:52.300 --> 24:55.628
<i>More news from our spy in the castle.</i>

24:55.695 --> 24:58.123
Not only is King Gregor dead,
but so is the Calthrop.

25:00.453 --> 25:03.046
Then the kingdom of Caddock
is ripe for the taking.

25:03.114 --> 25:05.475
But we must act quickly
if we want the Seeker as well.

25:05.542 --> 25:07.004
According to our spy,

25:07.072 --> 25:08.968
he will not remain
at Caddock much longer.

25:09.036 --> 25:10.866
He would leave
the kingdom defenseless?

25:10.934 --> 25:13.259
No.
The child-queen wants us

25:13.327 --> 25:15.389
to believe that
the Calthrop still lives.

25:15.457 --> 25:17.353
They plan to deceive us.

25:17.421 --> 25:19.715
To deceives us?

25:19.783 --> 25:22.744
And how do they
intend to do that?

25:22.811 --> 25:24.806
If Kahlan could learn
to use the Con Dar,

25:24.874 --> 25:27.929
just think of how
powerful we could be.

25:27.997 --> 25:29.762
There are some things
that even a Wizard

25:29.830 --> 25:32.953
of the First Order
doesn't fully understand.

25:33.021 --> 25:34.948
This is one thing I--

25:35.016 --> 25:37.610
I can't teach Kahlan.

25:37.678 --> 25:39.704
But Zedd--
Maybe we should

25:39.771 --> 25:42.562
respect her decision
to wear the rada'han.

25:42.630 --> 25:45.556
A power is only valuable
if it can be harnessed.

25:45.624 --> 25:48.282
If not,
then it's no power at all.

25:51.872 --> 25:55.064
That sounded just like
a Calthrop.

25:55.132 --> 25:57.727
I haven't cast
the spell yet.

26:03.303 --> 26:05.234
Another monster?
- Zedd's on his way

26:05.301 --> 26:06.868
to find out
who Shota cursed.

26:06.936 --> 26:08.467
What do we do when we find
this person?

26:08.534 --> 26:10.631
We prevent them from hurting
innocent people.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.197
My Queen, shall I
inform Prince Marius?

26:18.528 --> 26:21.926
Is there something else
bothering you, Your Majesty?

26:21.994 --> 26:24.024
I was going through
my mother's things

26:24.091 --> 26:26.422
and found her diary.

26:26.490 --> 26:28.922
I know why she was outside
the castle the night she died.

26:28.990 --> 26:31.120
She believed my father
was unfaithful,

26:31.188 --> 26:33.519
and that at night
he would meet a woman.

26:33.587 --> 26:34.751
Who?

26:34.819 --> 26:36.417
The diary doesn't say.

26:36.418 --> 26:38.816
Only that the woman lived
near Knollwood Grove.

26:38.884 --> 26:40.948
My mother went there
to confront them.

26:42.280 --> 26:44.246
But the king couldn't have
been unfaithful.

26:44.314 --> 26:46.544
By night, he was the Calthrop.

26:46.612 --> 26:48.343
But my mother didn't know that.

26:48.410 --> 26:51.044
My father kept it a secret,
even from her.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.741
Why would she think
he was unfaithful?

26:52.809 --> 26:55.139
Because someone told her.

26:55.207 --> 26:56.841
The diary doesn't say who,

26:56.908 --> 27:00.403
only that it was
someone she trusted.

27:00.471 --> 27:03.236
Whoever told her knew where
the king would be at night.

27:03.304 --> 27:05.169
And sent her to her death.

27:06.837 --> 27:09.133
There's only one person
besides your father

27:09.200 --> 27:11.166
who knew the truth
about the Calthrop.

27:12.666 --> 27:14.965
Prince Marius.

27:15.033 --> 27:16.697
Think about it.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.395
Marius stood the most to gain.

27:18.463 --> 27:20.495
An entire kingdom.

27:20.563 --> 27:22.626
Maybe he orchestrated
the queen's death

27:22.693 --> 27:24.558
at the hands
of the Calthrop.

27:24.626 --> 27:26.623
And he knew the king
would be so grief-stricken

27:26.691 --> 27:28.589
over killing his own wife,
he would want to die.

27:28.656 --> 27:32.083
So the prince summoned
the Seeker to fulfill his wish.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.649
And if it's the kingdom
that Marius wants...

27:35.717 --> 27:38.980
Then only one person
stands in his way.

27:39.046 --> 27:40.076
Me.

27:41.845 --> 27:44.375
No sign of Prince Marius.

27:44.442 --> 27:46.071
My men have searched.
He's not here.

27:46.139 --> 27:47.804
When's the last time
anyone saw him?

27:47.872 --> 27:49.771
When I informed him
of the second Calthrop.

27:49.838 --> 27:50.970
Well, he can't have gotten far.

27:51.036 --> 27:53.032
I'll find him.
Keep the queen safe.

27:54.398 --> 27:56.030
This way,
Your Majesty.

28:02.827 --> 28:04.757
What's the safest place
in the castle?

28:04.825 --> 28:06.989
I'm afraid there's
no place safe for you.

28:10.617 --> 28:12.314
You're part of Marius' plot.

28:12.382 --> 28:14.545
Take them.

28:14.612 --> 28:17.341
She wears a rada'han.
Her magic cannot harm you.

28:40.083 --> 28:41.947
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

28:46.276 --> 28:48.473
Where were you last night?

28:51.439 --> 28:53.770
The sun's going down soon.

28:53.838 --> 28:56.767
Maybe you came out here
to transform into the Calthrop?

28:58.331 --> 28:59.530
You think I'm the monster?

28:59.597 --> 29:02.228
I know you're a monster.

29:02.296 --> 29:03.694
You arranged the death
of the queen

29:03.762 --> 29:05.158
and your brother.

29:05.226 --> 29:06.956
Why would I do such a thing?

29:07.024 --> 29:08.521
Maybe because you thought

29:08.589 --> 29:10.386
he was too weak
to protect the kingdom.

29:10.454 --> 29:12.619
I loved my brother.

29:12.687 --> 29:14.685
But you loved his power more.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.848
And you would do anything
to get it and hold onto it.

29:17.915 --> 29:19.913
Even if it meant
striking a deal

29:19.980 --> 29:22.747
with Shota
to make you the Calthrop.

29:24.681 --> 29:26.178
You've gone mad.

29:29.278 --> 29:30.776
We'll find out soon enough.

29:30.844 --> 29:32.309
<i>Who is it, Shota?</i>

29:32.376 --> 29:34.241
Who have you cursed now?

29:36.107 --> 29:38.473
You still don't understand,
do you, Zeddicus?

29:38.541 --> 29:40.138
I didn't curse anyone.

29:40.206 --> 29:41.805
Enough games.

29:44.235 --> 29:45.468
I promised King Gregor

29:45.536 --> 29:47.566
that his kingdom would be
protected forever.

29:49.331 --> 29:51.163
So I cursed the royal scepter.

29:52.663 --> 29:55.359
<i>Whoever inherits the kingdom,</i>

29:55.427 --> 29:57.557
inherits the curse.

30:05.050 --> 30:07.581
It won't take them long
to break down this door.

30:07.648 --> 30:10.812
I'll have to Confess one
of the guards.

30:10.879 --> 30:14.743
But I'll need your help
to take off the rada'han.

30:14.811 --> 30:18.070
Corah.

30:18.138 --> 30:19.069
Corah!

30:20.868 --> 30:22.133
Corah.

30:52.583 --> 30:53.879
Wait.

30:53.946 --> 30:56.441
We need to get everyone
out of the castle.

30:56.508 --> 30:58.269
Take them to the caves
until you get word

30:58.336 --> 31:00.299
that it's safe to return.
- Right away.

31:09.316 --> 31:11.911
What's happening?

31:11.976 --> 31:13.640
Corah is the Calthrop.

31:15.703 --> 31:17.466
She's loose inside the castle.

31:17.533 --> 31:20.492
We have to stop the beast
without hurting Corah.

31:20.559 --> 31:23.218
Maybe we could use the rada'han
to change the queen back.

31:23.286 --> 31:25.415
But it didn't work on the king.

31:25.483 --> 31:28.542
And why was that?
- I have no idea you're--

31:40.749 --> 31:43.141
You were in charge of locking
King Gregor into the rada'han.

31:43.208 --> 31:45.070
Yes. But each night
I laced his meal

31:45.137 --> 31:46.369
with a sleeping potion.

31:46.437 --> 31:47.767
Once he was asleep,

31:47.835 --> 31:50.493
I unlocked the rada'han,
unleashing the Calthrop.

31:50.561 --> 31:54.517
So all we have to do is get this
thing around the beast's neck.

31:54.585 --> 31:56.312
I think Marius
can help with that.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.507
How may I serve you?

31:58.575 --> 32:00.068
You're going to be the bait.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.551
Ha!

33:07.052 --> 33:09.114
It's all right.

33:10.677 --> 33:13.241
It's all right.
It's all right.

33:13.308 --> 33:14.306
I'm here.

33:17.467 --> 33:18.964
<i>I don't understand.</i>

33:19.031 --> 33:21.126
If I'm the monster,
then why did Marius sneak

33:21.193 --> 33:22.855
out of the castle
before sunset?

33:22.923 --> 33:25.420
I was on my way to warn
the D'Haran

33:25.487 --> 33:27.812
that the Calthrop
was still alive.

33:27.880 --> 33:31.372
You murdered my mother
and father,

33:31.439 --> 33:33.536
all so you could kneel
before Rahl.

33:33.601 --> 33:35.993
In exchange for swearing
my allegiance to Darken Rahl,

33:36.061 --> 33:39.155
the D'Harans agreed
to leave me on the throne.

33:39.223 --> 33:42.646
But you weren't able to deliver
your message to the D'Harans.

33:42.714 --> 33:44.743
So they think
the Calthrop is dead?

33:44.811 --> 33:47.969
Yes. They're planning
to invade Caddock.

33:48.037 --> 33:49.269
They'll be here soon.

33:52.161 --> 33:53.923
Let them come.

33:53.991 --> 33:55.353
I'll remove the rada'han

33:55.421 --> 33:58.079
and the Calthrop will slaughter
every last one.

33:58.146 --> 33:59.575
It's too late.

35:36.030 --> 35:38.424
There's no escape.

35:56.248 --> 35:57.975
Bring the Seeker to me.

36:04.395 --> 36:05.490
You won't kill me.

36:05.558 --> 36:07.084
Rahl wants me alive.

36:07.152 --> 36:09.581
True.

36:09.645 --> 36:11.939
But he didn't say
in how many pieces.

36:18.393 --> 36:21.583
You'll find it
difficult to escape

36:21.584 --> 36:22.914
without your hands

36:40.671 --> 36:42.630
No!

36:42.698 --> 36:44.559
Fools. See what you've done?

36:46.621 --> 36:48.784
This will come to pass
within the hour.

36:48.852 --> 36:51.078
And we are too far away to do
anything to prevent it.

36:55.203 --> 36:56.531
You were right
when you said

36:56.598 --> 36:59.559
together we had the power
to move mountains, Shota.

37:01.921 --> 37:05.182
In fact, I think we could move
something far greater.

37:07.510 --> 37:10.239
<i>Bring the Seeker to me.</i>

37:14.664 --> 37:15.893
You won't kill me.

37:15.961 --> 37:18.023
Rahl wants me alive.

37:18.091 --> 37:20.153
True.

37:20.220 --> 37:22.514
But he didn't say
in how many pieces.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.670
You'll find it
difficult to escape

37:27.738 --> 37:30.135
without your hands.

38:06.670 --> 38:08.900
What witchery is this?

39:32.141 --> 39:34.436
Don't you see, Zeddicus?

39:34.504 --> 39:36.634
Together we can
accomplish anything.

39:36.702 --> 39:38.333
Nothing can stop us.

39:40.363 --> 39:41.762
That's precisely the reason

39:41.829 --> 39:44.625
why I left you
all those years ago.

39:44.692 --> 39:47.288
Ultimate power
must not go unchecked.

39:47.355 --> 39:49.686
You know this
as well as I do, Shota.

39:49.754 --> 39:51.318
We would become monsters.

39:53.884 --> 39:57.746
That's the very reason
we must defeat Darken Rahl.

40:02.541 --> 40:04.307
Then there is something else
I must show you.

40:15.963 --> 40:17.258
The D'Harans
won't stop running

40:17.326 --> 40:18.858
until they reach
the People's Palace.

40:18.925 --> 40:20.255
And once the stories spread

40:20.323 --> 40:22.453
of the Calthrop
terrorizing the kingdom,

40:22.521 --> 40:24.684
they'll think twice
about invading again.

40:24.752 --> 40:26.549
What happens when my people
learn the truth

40:26.617 --> 40:28.050
about the Calthrop?

40:28.116 --> 40:30.014
Maybe they don't need to know.

40:37.409 --> 40:40.272
You can wear the rada'han
at night to suppress the curse.

40:46.837 --> 40:49.233
My power is part of who I am.

40:49.301 --> 40:50.932
I tried to deny it,

40:51.000 --> 40:52.797
and it only put
people in danger.

40:54.897 --> 40:57.259
I need to embrace it,

40:57.326 --> 41:00.256
learn to control it.

41:00.324 --> 41:03.120
I think I have to do the same.

41:03.187 --> 41:05.786
My father was too ashamed
to tell his people

41:05.853 --> 41:08.151
the truth about himself,

41:08.218 --> 41:10.782
and look what it cost him.

41:10.850 --> 41:13.847
If he'd told my mother
he was the Calthrop,

41:13.914 --> 41:16.111
she never would have left
the castle that night...

41:17.877 --> 41:19.541
...and they'd both be alive.

41:21.540 --> 41:24.037
Nothing good can come
from hiding who I am.

41:38.918 --> 41:40.045
What's wrong?

41:41.845 --> 41:44.804
When the D'Harans had you,

41:44.872 --> 41:47.401
I tried to bring on the Con Dar,

41:47.469 --> 41:49.266
but I couldn't.

41:49.334 --> 41:51.664
Even when I needed it most.

41:51.732 --> 41:53.162
You told me it took
your whole life

41:53.230 --> 41:55.493
to learn how to use
your Confessor powers.

41:55.561 --> 41:56.893
Give it time.

42:01.222 --> 42:02.052
Zedd.

42:04.519 --> 42:06.449
We have to hurry.

42:06.517 --> 42:08.381
What is it?

42:08.449 --> 42:10.813
Shota showed me a vision.

42:10.881 --> 42:13.677
There is another
<i>Book of Counted Shadows.</i>

42:15.675 --> 42:17.936
Long ago, in secret,

42:18.004 --> 42:20.834
an ancient monk transcribed
a copy of the book.

42:20.901 --> 42:23.930
If we could get our hands on it,
we could defeat Rahl.

42:23.998 --> 42:25.928
Did Shota's vision show you
where it is?

42:25.996 --> 42:28.924
Yeah. But there was more
to her vision.

42:28.992 --> 42:32.019
Soon Rahl will also learn
of the Book's whereabouts.

42:32.087 --> 42:34.652
And when he does,
he'll send men to retrieve it.

42:34.719 --> 42:36.548
The only question is,

42:36.616 --> 42:39.141
can we get there first?

42:39.359 --> 42:40.521
