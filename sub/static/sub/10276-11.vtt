Here we are, Sofia.
The Whispering Woods.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.668
I've been wanting to
come here for so long, Dad.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.171
I've heard these woods
are enchanted.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.540
Well, you'll have
plenty of time to look around

01:14.542 --> 01:17.776
while I see how the new road
is coming along.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.545
Then afterwards,
we can have a picnic.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.613
Why wait till then?

01:29.789 --> 01:32.791
Thank you, coachman.
Come on, Clover.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.893
Let's go see if we can
find some berries,

01:34.895 --> 01:36.195
or pixies or sprites.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.234
Come on, Whatnaught.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.770
Sofia, wait.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.572
Here. Take one of these.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.941
- What are those?
- Together feathers.

01:48.943 --> 01:52.744
If you lose your way,
your feather will point
the way back to my feather,

01:52.746 --> 01:55.614
which I'll keep
right here.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.649
- Thanks, Dad.
- Have fun.

02:01.921 --> 02:05.657
Hmm. It looks like
a normal forest so far.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.726
That doesn't look
so normal.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.799
Wow. I've never seen
a tree like this before.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.134
CLOVER:
It's so shiny.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.306
Whoa! Oh!

02:21.308 --> 02:24.243
( gasps )
Clover!

02:24.245 --> 02:28.347
Clover! Hang on, Clover.
I'll get you.

02:29.516 --> 02:32.985
This can't be good!

02:46.866 --> 02:49.868
Wow! Where are we?

02:49.870 --> 02:54.206
- Sof, why is
the sky pink?
- I don't know.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.441
And look at
those mushrooms.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.810
I don't think we're in
Enchancia anymore.

02:58.812 --> 03:02.814
- Course not.
You're in Elvenmoor.
- Where?

03:02.816 --> 03:05.951
The realm of the elves.
Elfonso's the name.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.353
- I'm Sofia.
- Clover.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.556
Um, how did we
get here?

03:10.558 --> 03:13.692
Why, through the magical
Elvenmoor door, of course.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.127
It takes you from
the human world

03:15.129 --> 03:16.962
to the Elfin world.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.731
Human world, Elfin world,
Human, Elfin, human, Elfin,

03:19.733 --> 03:22.901
- and back again,
if you desire.
- We desire.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.804
You can't go yet.
You haven't had any fun.

03:25.806 --> 03:26.972
That's okay.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.540
No, it's not.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.142
Not okay at all,

03:30.144 --> 03:32.578
because Elvenmoor
is the land of fun.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.880
If you like to frolic,
love to laugh,

03:34.882 --> 03:36.582
and crave excitement,

03:36.584 --> 03:39.818

05:25.125 --> 05:26.958
( giggling )

05:26.960 --> 05:29.194
Fun, huh? Wait till you see
the rest of Elvenmoor.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.029
CLOVER: Yo, this place
is great.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.998
How about I give you
the grand tour?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.866
Ooh, lead the way.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.301
I wish we could,

05:36.303 --> 05:38.470
but we should probably
be getting back.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.472
Come on, Sof.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.641
We can stay
a little longer, right?

05:42.643 --> 05:45.177
You have lots of time
before the door moves.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.945
The door moves?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.880
Aye. Several times
a day, it zips down the path

05:48.882 --> 05:51.016
to other parts
of Elvenmoor.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.285
But it's a long trek
to the next stop,

05:53.287 --> 05:55.654
so it gives you
a warning before it moves.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.456
What kind of warning?

05:57.458 --> 06:00.959
It chimes a few minutes before
it zips away to its next stop.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.995
But it just got here,
so we're good to go for a while.

06:03.997 --> 06:07.032
Does the silver tree
on the other side move, too?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.900
Nope. The tree stays put.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.902
Only the Elvenmoor
door moves.

06:13.039 --> 06:17.376
Well, it doesn't sound like
we have time for a whole tour.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.811
Oh, let me at least
show you one thing

06:19.813 --> 06:21.880
I just know
you're gonna love.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.382
Okay.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.883
Ooh, I think
I already found it.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.952
Are those carrots?

06:29.255 --> 06:31.089
Even better.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.491
It's a forever carrot.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.593
Take one bite,
take ten bites.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.495
Take eleventy-fifty bites.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.163
It always grows back.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.502
( muffled )
It's a dream come true.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.370
But it's nothin'
compared to

06:45.372 --> 06:47.272
the Silverspray Stream.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.940
What's the Silverspray
Stream, Elfonso?

06:50.743 --> 06:54.679
Step right up
and prepare to be dazzled!

06:54.681 --> 06:55.781
( giggles )

07:03.790 --> 07:06.258
The road is to continue
here, Your Majesty.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.893
But this tree
is in the way.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.728
Oh!

07:09.730 --> 07:11.229
Can we divert the road
around it?

07:11.231 --> 07:13.031
The ground is
too uneven.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.599
It will put us
back months.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.134
We must cut
the tree down, sire.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.070
- No!
- ( sighs )
If we must.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.872
We'll just go
fetch our saw then.

07:20.874 --> 07:24.042
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
If they cut down that tree,

07:24.044 --> 07:25.377
the door to Elvenmoor
will be closed forever.

07:25.379 --> 07:28.246
No one will be able
to get in or out.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.982
I've got to get help.
Someone has to stop them.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.825
I don't get it,
Elfonso.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.660
It looks like
a normal stream.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.962
Oh, but it's not.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.365
Hop in a log and prepare
for the ride of your lives.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.138
A human?
Wait!

07:53.140 --> 07:55.140
Oh, hello there, Elfred.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.409
Meet our new friends,
Sofia and Clover.

07:57.411 --> 07:59.845
- I'm showin' 'em around.
- Hi.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.614
Do you know the humans
who are building the road
through the Whispering Woods?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.483
That's my dad's
royal road crew.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.185
Then I must speak with you
about something very important.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.521
Slow down, Elfred.

08:09.523 --> 08:13.024
Can't you see we're
about to go on
the Silverspray Stream?

08:13.026 --> 08:16.194
Don't worry, you have
plenty of time for a ride.

08:16.196 --> 08:19.030
Great. We can talk
after, okay?

08:19.032 --> 08:21.433
- All right.
- Let's go.

08:21.435 --> 08:24.302
But, Sofia.
Elfonso!

08:24.304 --> 08:26.872
Hope you're not
afraid of heights.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.107
CLOVER: Why?

08:33.145 --> 08:35.080
Elf-tastic!

08:40.052 --> 08:42.320
( door chiming )

08:42.322 --> 08:43.855
Oh, no.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.958
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.465
That was a-mazing.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.470
So what did you want
to talk to me about, Elfred?

08:58.472 --> 09:01.172
Oh, Sofia, your royal
road crew wants to
chop down

09:01.174 --> 09:03.909
the silver tree in
the Whispering Woods.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.378
If they do, we elves
won't be able to leave
Elvenmoor,

09:06.380 --> 09:08.713
and you won't
be able to get home.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.482
That would be awful.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.551
I'll go back right now
and tell my dad

09:12.553 --> 09:13.752
not to cut down
the tree.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.054
Oh, wait.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.723
- Where's the door?
- It moved.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.225
But I thought we had time.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.727
Oh, sorry about that.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.530
The wonders of
Elvenmoor can be
very distracting, Sofia.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.666
With all the fun
to be had here,

09:27.668 --> 09:29.267
it's hard to focus on
what actually matters.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.269
Well, we have to catch up
to the door.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.505
Where did it go?

09:33.507 --> 09:37.075
I'm afraid the door's
next stop is quite
a distance ahead.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.378
But if you follow
the green path, it'll
lead you right to it.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.248
That's all?
Just follow the path?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.083
And stay on the path.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.285
If you want to get back
in time to save the tree,

09:47.287 --> 09:50.522
you must not get
sidetracked by
all the merriment.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.457
We won't.
Ready, Clover?

09:52.459 --> 09:54.092
Whoa, look at that.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.729
Clover, we have to get
to the door right away.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.898
Right. Door.
Got it.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.133
Oh, I'll come, too.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.970
There's a whole lot of
fun things to do along
the green path.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.572
Elfonso, this is
no time for games.

10:07.574 --> 10:10.375
You must help them
to the door while I
go warn the others.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.378
Of course. You can
count on me, Elfred.

10:13.380 --> 10:17.148
Remember, Sofia,
stay on the path.

10:22.922 --> 10:26.992
Now, let's put on our gloves
and get started.

10:29.662 --> 10:33.298
I don't know why,
but I can't get these on.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.700
'Cause those are mine.
Genius.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.140
Sorry, boss.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.647
Now what'd you do
with the saw?

10:48.649 --> 10:49.981
It was right here,
wasn't it?

10:57.590 --> 10:59.491
Hoo-hoo!

10:59.493 --> 11:02.160
Welcome to
Rockbeat Garden, my friends.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.129
The most rockin' place
in Elvenmoor.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.631
Wow, I've never seen
anything like this.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.333
- Ah!
- Whoa!

11:08.335 --> 11:11.636
Ever hear
roll and rock music?

11:11.638 --> 11:13.805
It's an Elfin favorite.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.507
I can see why.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.542
And this song's from
the volcanic years.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.177
You should hear
their new stuff.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.814
( crashing rhythmically )

11:22.816 --> 11:26.384
Makes a guy wanna do
the Cottontail.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.653
Wait. What are you
doing, Clover?

11:28.655 --> 11:31.356
We can't get sidetracked.
We have to get going.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.391
Oh, right.
Sorry, Sof.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.194
I guess I can catch
the next show.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.229
Elfred was right.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.632
- It is easy to get
distracted here.
- What's that, Sof?

11:40.634 --> 11:44.002
Keen observation,
Sofia, and very true.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.204
Take this bubble field,
for instance.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.207
Even the smartest elf
can be so swept away

11:49.209 --> 11:51.910
by the thought of taking
a fun bubble ride

11:51.912 --> 11:54.412
that he forgets all about
what he's supposed to be doing.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.248
The door!
There it is.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.726
CLOVER: What a view!

12:07.728 --> 12:10.695
Elfonso, Clover,
get back here.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.431
We have to get through
the door before they
cut down the tree.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.067
Don't worry, Sof.
We'll float right to it.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.836
How do you steer
this thing?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.904
You don't.
It's all part of the fun.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.506
That's right, it's...
Wait, what?

12:21.508 --> 12:24.209
You're going
away from the path.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.311
Oh, I gotta
bring them back.

12:27.847 --> 12:30.715
Here goes nothing.
Whoa!

12:30.717 --> 12:34.419
( straining )

12:36.422 --> 12:39.624
We have to get down.
The door's just up ahead.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.527
But these bubbles
don't come down until
they want to, Sofia.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.496
Then we'll have to pop them.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.703
- How?
- Your carrot.

12:51.705 --> 12:53.471
Oh, good thinkin', Sof.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.554
And that, my friends,
is bubble riding.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.157
Let's get to the door
before it moves.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.792
- ( door chimes )
- Hurry.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.429
Oh, we're too late.
No!

13:18.431 --> 13:19.931
Aw, man.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.267
I can't believe
we missed it again.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.902
I'm sorry, Sof.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.837
I guess I shouldn't
have gone bubble riding.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.072
I didn't think it would
make you miss the door.

13:28.074 --> 13:31.509
( sighs ) I know
there's lot of fun
stuff here, guys,

13:31.511 --> 13:34.112
but we'll never get home
if we keep missing the door.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.281
I won't get off
the path again, Sofia.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.349
- I promise.
- I promise, too.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.351
Okay, but let's hurry.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.420
This could be our last
chance to get through
the door

13:42.422 --> 13:44.556
before they cut
down the tree.

13:49.461 --> 13:52.197
Sorry about losin'
the saw, boss.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.299
Oh, don't worry
about it.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.634
Just try to hang on
to your ax, okay?

13:56.636 --> 13:58.703
Now, before we start
choppin' down this tree,

13:58.705 --> 14:02.273
we oughta figure out
which way we want it to fall.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.175
Um, down?

14:04.177 --> 14:07.545
Of course we want it
to fall down,

14:07.547 --> 14:09.547
but in which direction?

14:09.549 --> 14:11.149
This way or that?

14:11.151 --> 14:12.817
- That looks good.
- Okay then.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.719
On the count
of three.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.589
One, two, three.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.469
What are those?

14:31.471 --> 14:33.638
Oh, they're strawbapples.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.540
And they taste
even better than they look.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.877
Ooh, hoo-hoo.
I'll just have a nibble.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.813
You can't, Clover.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.581
We have to stay
on the path.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.651
Aw. Well, good thing
I have my fancy carrot

14:46.653 --> 14:49.187
for times like these.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.489
Chomp. Wait.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.925
Chomp. Wait.

14:53.927 --> 14:56.427
There it is.
The door.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.532
Time to go.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.102
Thanks for everything,
Elfonso.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.604
- Yeah, especially for my--
- Take it.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.606
Take it. Take it.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.874
My carrot. No!

15:09.876 --> 15:11.509
It's a taykit bird.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.211
Clover, we have to go.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.712
Take it!

15:14.714 --> 15:16.514
- Sofia!!
- Clover!

15:16.516 --> 15:19.550
Oh, those taykit birds
take everything.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.419
- We have to save Clover.
- But the door.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.956
I can't leave him behind.
I'm coming, Clover.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.293
Hey, easy with the claws.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.628
Too heavy.
( squawk )

15:30.630 --> 15:33.598
- ( Clover screams )
- Clover!

15:33.600 --> 15:35.466
Are you okay?

15:35.468 --> 15:38.569
Better now.
Hey, I'm sorry, Sof.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.605
I know we were
almost home.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.473
It's not your
fault, Clover.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.409
We'll just get back
on the path and head
to the door

15:44.411 --> 15:45.910
as fast as we can.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.445
But where is the path?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.247
It's back
the way we came.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.915
But which way
is that?

15:50.917 --> 15:52.317
I don't know.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.988
I think we're lost.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.589
No, we're not lost.

15:58.591 --> 16:02.060
There. I see the door,
through the trees.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.195
This way.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.633
Yes. Here's the door.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.271
Okay, Clover,
let's go home. Bye.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.573
- Bye, Elfonso.
- Farewell, friends.

16:17.609 --> 16:20.712
The ride back was way shorter
than the ride going in.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.582
It didn't work, Clover.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.184
We're still in Elvenmoor.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.719
I don't get it.
Why?

16:29.688 --> 16:31.522
Oh, no.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.124
I'll tell you why.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.093
Because that's not
the real door.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.527
I don't understand.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.363
We're in the grove
of illusion.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.598
The magic here shows you
what you want to see

16:40.600 --> 16:43.368
most in the world,
only none of it's real.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.671
I'm afraid Elvenmoor
magic can be tricky
from time to time,

16:46.673 --> 16:48.639
and this is
one of those times.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.274
Now what do we do?

16:50.276 --> 16:52.043
We have no idea
where we are,

16:52.045 --> 16:53.878
they're going to cut
the tree down.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.681
My dad's going to be so worried
when he can't find me.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.117
He'll think I got lost
in the woods.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.985
That's it.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.521
My dad gave me
this together feather

17:03.523 --> 17:05.356
in case I got lost.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.657
It points the way
back to him.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.493
We have to follow
the feather.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.827
No matter what.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.396
You got it, Sof.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.231
I shall have no fun
whatsoever.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.633
Together feather,
lead the way.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.038
Gentlemen,
what's the hold-up?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.707
- We, um...
- Had some equipment trouble.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.143
But everything's
fine now.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.645
These oxen will
pull the tree down easily.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.047
Your Majesty.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.249
Very well.
Get on with it then.

17:37.423 --> 17:39.991
( anxious chittering )

17:39.993 --> 17:41.559
Huh?

17:43.162 --> 17:44.729
What's this?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.230
Hey there, little guy.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.566
( chittering )

17:48.568 --> 17:50.701
I think he's trying
to tell me something.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.769
( chittering continues )

17:58.710 --> 18:01.779
Uh... your mother had an acorn
and it fell into that hole?

18:01.781 --> 18:04.749
- ( chittering )
- No, no. Okay.

18:06.685 --> 18:09.687
Um, oh, you like fishing.

18:15.694 --> 18:17.862
We have to cross that?

18:17.864 --> 18:20.264
It's the way
the feather's pointing.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.967
But crossing a spinning
mushroom field is impossible.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.902
The only way is to
hop on top of them,

18:24.904 --> 18:26.971
but they'll spin us
round and round and round

18:26.973 --> 18:28.806
till we get too dizzy
and fall off.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.708
It's kind of fun
actually,

18:30.710 --> 18:32.710
but not if you're trying
to get to the other side.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.612
- Can we go around it?
- ( door chimes )

18:34.614 --> 18:36.247
It's the door chime!

18:36.249 --> 18:38.616
Which means we're
running out of time.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.986
We have to cross
the mushroom field now.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.621
Whoa!

18:43.623 --> 18:45.423
I guess we're
doin' this.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.058
Looks like it.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.662
- Whoa!
- Ha ha!

18:51.664 --> 18:53.898
( grunting )

18:56.802 --> 18:57.969
Keep going, guys.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.837
CLOVER:
With all this spinning,

18:59.839 --> 19:02.173
I can't tell
which way to go.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.509
Don't let it
distract you, Clover.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.577
Just focus on
the feather.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.347
- Focus on the feather.
- The feather.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.482
Follow it no matter
which way you spin.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.592
That's it!

19:27.933 --> 19:30.101
There's the door.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.936
Run, Clover.

19:35.674 --> 19:39.143
- Bye, Elfonso.
- See ya.

19:39.145 --> 19:42.680
For what I hope is
the last time today, farewell!

19:46.118 --> 19:48.319
You're entering
a beauty pageant?

19:48.321 --> 19:49.820
( angry chittering )

19:49.822 --> 19:51.789
I'm sorry, little guy.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.691
I don't know
what you're trying to say.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.826
We just can't wait
any longer.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.895
Gentlemen, pull down
that tree.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.130
Right.

20:12.744 --> 20:15.246
- Sofia?
- Dad.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.215
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

20:19.184 --> 20:22.587
Sofia, did you just...
Were you in that tree?

20:22.589 --> 20:24.088
We were in
Elvenmoor, Dad.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.057
- The land of the elves.
- ALL: Elves?!

20:26.059 --> 20:28.726
This tree magically
takes you there.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.728
You can't cut it down,

20:30.730 --> 20:32.997
or the elves won't be able
to leave Elvenmoor ever again.

20:32.999 --> 20:36.567
Then by all means, we must
leave the tree standing.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.071
Yes! Thanks, Dad.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.441
Foreman, the road will
have to go around the tree,

20:43.443 --> 20:45.509
no matter how long
it takes.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.913
Yes, Your Majesty.
Let's get to work.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.048
Sofia, thank goodness
you made it back

20:51.050 --> 20:52.883
before the tree
was taken down.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.519
It was all because of
the together feather.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.888
It showed me
the way back to you.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.991
So, are you ready
for our picnic?

21:01.893 --> 21:05.763
You can tell me
all about Elvenmoor.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.399
Why tell you about it
when you can see it
for yourself, Dad?

21:08.401 --> 21:09.967
Let's have our picnic there.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.136
I don't know, Sofia.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.538
Don't worry. I know
how to get back.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.374
But let's leave one
together feather here,

21:16.376 --> 21:17.875
just in case.

21:17.877 --> 21:21.412
Okay, let's picnic
in Elvenmoor.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.614
- Here we go!
- Whoa!

21:23.616 --> 21:26.984
Never-ending carrots,
here I come.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.854
Whoo hoo-hoo!
