WEBVTT

00:02.379 --> 00:03.922
Erin, hey.

00:04.172 --> 00:06.841
In two minutes, I want you
to come into this meeting

00:06.925 --> 00:09.469
and tell me that I have a
really important phone call.

00:09.928 --> 00:11.805
I'm not going
to take it

00:11.888 --> 00:14.599
because I want him to know how
important the meeting is to me.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.394
Who's calling?
Nobody.

00:17.477 --> 00:21.648
Just say that I'm... Just make
it up that I have a phone call.

00:21.731 --> 00:23.400
And then I'm going
to refuse to take it.

00:23.650 --> 00:24.693
You're not going
to take it?

00:24.776 --> 00:25.735
Just make up
a phone call.

00:25.819 --> 00:27.028
It's not
a real call.

00:27.112 --> 00:28.196
Just make it up.

00:28.279 --> 00:29.823
Oh, okay. And then
come in and tell me.

00:29.906 --> 00:30.949
Okay.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.075
It doesn't matter
what it is.

00:32.158 --> 00:33.201
You're not going
to get it, though.

00:33.284 --> 00:34.244
I'm not going
to take it.

00:34.327 --> 00:35.662
And then he's
going to be like,

00:35.787 --> 00:37.163
"Wow, this is a really
important meeting."

00:37.247 --> 00:39.124
Copy that.
Okay.

00:40.709 --> 00:42.127
Okay, so,

00:42.335 --> 00:44.921
tell me exactly
what kind of deal

00:45.004 --> 00:48.466
you are getting right now and
I'll tell you how we can beat it.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.218
Well, we've been
going with...

00:50.301 --> 00:51.302
Andy?

00:51.386 --> 00:52.387
Yeah?

00:52.470 --> 00:53.471
You have a very
important call.

00:53.596 --> 00:56.057
I'm sorry, I'm with a very important client.
It'll have to wait.

00:56.599 --> 00:58.685
Are you sure? It's really,
really important.

00:59.352 --> 01:03.815
There is nothing more important to
me right now than this meeting.

01:04.899 --> 01:07.569
Really? Because
your mother is dead.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.658
Oh, my God!

01:14.534 --> 01:16.077
I don't think she's dead.

01:16.327 --> 01:19.330
She's dead.
She was hit by a bus.

01:20.165 --> 01:21.958
She's not dead.
This is exactly

01:22.083 --> 01:23.877
the kind of thing
my mom pulls.

01:24.169 --> 01:26.838
This isn't one of those times.
It's the police.

01:27.672 --> 01:30.008
They said it's the worst
they've ever seen.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.510
Andy, I'm really sorry
about your mother.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.013
My deepest
condolences.

01:36.973 --> 01:40.727
You must take
this call. It's...

01:42.437 --> 01:44.355
Yeah, line one?

01:44.439 --> 01:45.732
Line two.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.150
Okay.

01:49.402 --> 01:50.904
Hi.
It's Darryl.

01:50.987 --> 01:53.281
Erin told me to pretend to be
a cop and say your mom died.

01:53.364 --> 01:54.532
Oh!

01:55.450 --> 01:56.451
Gosh.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.952
Dude.
Thank you, Officer.

01:58.036 --> 01:59.537
Look, man,
this is a bad idea.

01:59.662 --> 02:01.122
Did she have
any last words or...

02:01.206 --> 02:03.082
Really?
That is messed up, man.

02:03.166 --> 02:07.545
Make sure that your client
gets the best deal possible.

02:07.796 --> 02:08.922
You're a bad man,
Andy Bernard.

02:09.047 --> 02:10.757
That is so Mom. That stuff
can come back and get you.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.634
It's called karma. You do
not want to be messing...

02:12.717 --> 02:13.885
All right,
but thank you, Officer.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.220
I've got an uncle...

02:17.889 --> 02:20.350
Erin, please hold
all my other calls.

02:22.894 --> 02:24.395
Where were we?

02:47.001 --> 02:48.336
Hey, Cathy.
Hi.

02:48.419 --> 02:49.754
How's it going?
Everything make sense?

02:49.879 --> 02:51.214
I think everything
is under control.

02:51.381 --> 02:52.757
Great.
You should sit down.

02:52.841 --> 02:54.175
No, I'm fine.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.677
No, I should go
fill out my paperwork.

02:56.094 --> 02:57.178
Okay.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.101
That was just me.
Pregnant Pam.

03:04.102 --> 03:05.436
And I make sounds
much worse than this.

03:05.603 --> 03:06.980
We know.

03:08.439 --> 03:12.694
I'm training a temp to be my replacement
while I'm on maternity leave.

03:12.777 --> 03:15.363
I should have
mentioned I'm pregnant.

03:16.072 --> 03:18.324
You probably
didn't notice because

03:18.449 --> 03:20.743
it's impossible to tell
because I'm so small.

03:20.827 --> 03:22.912
But yeah, I'm pregnant.

03:24.205 --> 03:25.748
Oh, come on.

03:25.999 --> 03:28.084
Hey. Asking for a friend,

03:28.167 --> 03:30.211
do you happen to know
if that new girl is single?

03:31.671 --> 03:32.755
Doubt it.

03:33.298 --> 03:34.799
Yeah. Me, too.

03:36.593 --> 03:37.719
You doubt it?

03:37.844 --> 03:38.970
What's that?

03:39.345 --> 03:40.889
Why do you doubt
that she's single?

03:41.556 --> 03:45.310
Honestly, I have no idea. I just figured
we'd save her from Ryan, right?

03:50.732 --> 03:52.483
What are you
doing with my lunch?

03:52.650 --> 03:54.402
I'm delivering it
from the fridge.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.905
It's like a porno. "Hey,
did anybody order a pizza?"

03:57.155 --> 03:58.656
It's not pizza.

03:58.823 --> 04:00.325
Yeah, and we're not
about to make love.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.659
I just thought
maybe you'd want

04:01.784 --> 04:03.036
to eat lunch at
your desk today

04:03.119 --> 04:05.121
so that during lunch
we could go down

04:05.246 --> 04:07.248
to the warehouse and
bang out a few tunes.

04:07.332 --> 04:09.500
I like the sound of that.
ls Kevin here?

04:10.919 --> 04:12.337
You tell me.

04:18.092 --> 04:20.720
So word on the street
is she has a boyfriend.

04:21.930 --> 04:23.765
Well, he's probably
a drug dealer.

04:23.848 --> 04:25.600
That's the best way to
land a hot girlfriend.

04:25.725 --> 04:27.518
You just...
You get her hooked on blow.

04:28.937 --> 04:30.939
It's going to be nice
to have just like a

04:31.022 --> 04:33.524
healthy, young, fit presence
in the middle of the office.

04:33.608 --> 04:34.609
Yes, aesthetically
speaking, strictly.

04:34.692 --> 04:35.652
Yeah.

04:35.735 --> 04:37.153
- She adds a nice presence.
- Good energy.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.947
Yeah, it's going to
be nice to have

04:39.030 --> 04:40.657
someone hot at
Pam's desk, huh?

04:41.491 --> 04:42.951
No, no. Not even.

04:43.076 --> 04:44.577
I'm kidding.

04:44.661 --> 04:47.997
Oh, my gosh, you guys. She's
obviously super cute. I get it.

04:48.581 --> 04:50.625
But I'd like to point
out there is 50 pounds

04:50.708 --> 04:52.669
more of me to love,
if that's your thing.

04:52.752 --> 04:54.087
Pam, you look more
beautiful now than ever.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.254
Radiant.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.674
Thank you, guys. Really,
thank you, very sweet.

04:57.757 --> 04:59.801
Yeah, you have
this sexy glow.

04:59.884 --> 05:02.261
Well, it's one of
the most common fetishes.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.472
Really? Well,
thank you all.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.933
You know, it's not just pregnant
women who don't get their due.

05:07.016 --> 05:08.559
You know who's gorgeous?

05:08.643 --> 05:09.894
Helen Mirren.
Yes.

05:09.978 --> 05:12.981
Yes, have you seen her
in a bikini? Amazing.

05:13.064 --> 05:15.984
What would be the hottest thing
ever is a pregnant Helen Mirren.

05:16.067 --> 05:17.360
Ooh!

05:19.904 --> 05:23.282
Okay, okay.
Okay, no, no, no.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.618
This is disgusting. Do you
realize what you're saying?

05:25.702 --> 05:29.122
The hottest thing ever would be
a 66-year-old pregnant woman?

05:29.205 --> 05:31.124
In this case, yes.
No!

05:31.207 --> 05:35.586
There are universal biological
standards of beauty and attraction.

05:35.712 --> 05:38.840
And you are purposefully
celebrating the opposite of them

05:38.923 --> 05:40.883
to mollycoddle
a pregnant woman.

05:41.092 --> 05:42.093
No, we're not. No.

05:42.260 --> 05:43.261
Yes, you are.

05:43.344 --> 05:47.098
And another thing, Helen Mirren
was born Helen Mironoff.

05:47.306 --> 05:51.019
That's right, you're fake salivating
over a Soviet-era Russian.

06:06.451 --> 06:07.660
Nice scatting, man.

06:07.744 --> 06:11.039
Thank you. I think I said "doop"
instead of "boop" at one point.

06:11.122 --> 06:13.416
Not bad, fellas.
You're better than you look.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.293
Hey, screw you!

06:17.295 --> 06:19.130
Hey, Robert.
Are we meeting early?

06:19.255 --> 06:21.090
Just taking a stroll.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.885
What exactly have
I stumbled upon here?

06:23.968 --> 06:26.679
Well, we're all musicians and
we play together sometimes.

06:27.013 --> 06:28.097
You're a band?

06:28.222 --> 06:29.307
Thank you.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.893
We're called
Kevin and the Zits.

06:32.310 --> 06:33.895
That was never agreed upon.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.646
I miss being in a band.

06:36.314 --> 06:38.149
Miss no more.
What do you play? Join us.

06:38.274 --> 06:40.068
I have a tambourine.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.987
Tambourine? You know
I'm the CEO, right?

06:43.821 --> 06:46.074
CEOs don't play tambourines.
Tambourines are for girlfriends.

06:46.157 --> 06:48.910
I play harmonica. I think
I have one in the car.

06:48.993 --> 06:50.745
Great.
Nice.

06:51.829 --> 06:54.248
Guys, Robert is
going to be a zit.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.793
Again, never agreed upon.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.378
I had totally given up on hanging
out with Robert California

06:59.462 --> 07:01.672
and now he wants
to be in our band.

07:01.756 --> 07:03.132
And when you're in
a rock and roll band

07:03.216 --> 07:04.550
with somebody,
you're bonded for life.

07:04.634 --> 07:07.345
Usually that life
is short and tragic.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.305
That's okay, right?

07:09.430 --> 07:10.848
Yeah, even cooler.

07:10.932 --> 07:13.351
We all got to
go sometime.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.312
HEY
HEY

07:16.395 --> 07:18.064
Helen Mirren. Hot?

07:19.023 --> 07:20.775
Yeah. Super pretty.

07:20.858 --> 07:21.901
Huh.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.694
What about Cathy?

07:23.820 --> 07:24.904
The temp?

07:25.071 --> 07:27.031
Yeah, do you think she's hot?
Nope.

07:27.365 --> 07:29.325
I'm not asking
if you're into her.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.452
Just objectively,
do you find her attractive?

07:31.911 --> 07:33.037
I'm telling you I don't.

07:33.746 --> 07:35.164
You don't find
Cathy attractive?

07:35.289 --> 07:36.707
No, I don't.

07:36.958 --> 07:40.419
No, I'm not going to tell my
nine months pregnant wife

07:40.503 --> 07:43.422
that I find her replacement
objectively attractive.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.174
Just like I'm not going to
tell my 2-year-old daughter

07:45.258 --> 07:48.344
that violent video games
are objectively more fun.

07:49.220 --> 07:51.681
It's true, but it
doesn't help anybody.

07:52.390 --> 07:53.808
Look at her.

07:55.143 --> 07:57.186
Even I want some
fries with that shake.

07:58.896 --> 08:02.692
Okay. I don't.
So are we good?

08:07.363 --> 08:09.031
That's just absurd.

08:09.157 --> 08:10.867
Yes, because
she's hot, right?

08:11.200 --> 08:12.869
Her breasts are large,
her waist is small,

08:12.994 --> 08:14.662
her reproductive health
in ample evidence.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.581
Facial symmetry, come on.

08:17.748 --> 08:20.710
The thing about pregnancy is
people treat you differently.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.962
Like you're
a kid, almost.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.964
They lose all
sense of boundaries.

08:25.047 --> 08:29.260
They start acting weird, telling you
things that clearly aren't true.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.096
I know it sounds nuts
but I think Dwight

08:32.263 --> 08:34.724
is the only one who's
telling me the truth.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.935
Dwight, am I hot right now?

08:38.269 --> 08:40.438
Why would I or anyone else think
that you're hot right now?

08:40.521 --> 08:42.273
I can't impregnate you
and that's the driving

08:42.440 --> 08:44.192
force between
male-female attraction.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.611
What about before?
Was I attractive before?

08:46.861 --> 08:48.029
Eh...

08:48.112 --> 08:51.574
You were at your most attractive when you
were 24, with a slight gradual decline.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.035
And a steep drop off when you got
pregnant for the first time.

08:54.118 --> 08:55.620
Gradual recovery and...

08:56.245 --> 08:59.248
Well, now obviously
you're at an all-time low.

09:00.791 --> 09:01.792
Hmm.

09:04.462 --> 09:07.131
I think Jim's lying to me about
not being attracted to Cathy.

09:08.132 --> 09:10.885
You think Jim's lying?
That's so cute.

09:11.469 --> 09:12.553
I know he's lying.

09:12.845 --> 09:13.888
5 bucks if you can
get him to admit it.

09:14.013 --> 09:15.056
Done.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.558
I never touch
a pregnant woman.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.352
Yeah, that's
the Dwight I need.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.439
If we're going to work together,
we need some ground rules.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.565
Okay.

09:24.649 --> 09:27.860
Rule one, our only
loyalty is to the truth.

09:28.653 --> 09:30.196
I think so. Okay.

09:30.321 --> 09:31.948
Rule two,
we stop at nothing.

09:32.907 --> 09:35.326
What is that...
Is it... Well, okay.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.577
Rule three.

09:37.203 --> 09:38.204
Don't fall in love.

09:38.329 --> 09:39.372
Yup. Good.

09:40.164 --> 09:41.749
We're going to
bust this guy.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.459
Honesty is very
important to me.

09:43.542 --> 09:47.046
So important. And then we
will destroy the man himself.

09:47.129 --> 09:50.049
Let's just see how we feel
when we get there.

09:51.050 --> 09:52.843
Well, you came to
the right person.

09:52.969 --> 09:54.762
You have to follow
your intuition, Pam.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.764
You don't want to end up
like Elin Nordegren.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.558
Actually, what am I saying? You wish
you had her life. No offense, Pam.

09:59.809 --> 10:01.560
None taken.
What have you got?

10:02.019 --> 10:04.981
It is called the Matchmaker
Test and it is very powerful.

10:05.064 --> 10:06.983
Basically, we have Pam
ask Jim which

10:07.066 --> 10:08.943
of his friends he would
set up with Cathy.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.945
If Jim picks
a really hot friend,

10:11.070 --> 10:13.030
then we know
he thinks that Cathy's hot.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.367
Hmm.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.628
Hey, you found us.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.463
You guys sound
great, man.

10:29.547 --> 10:33.342
Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is
Curtis Dorough, local musician,

10:33.426 --> 10:35.094
and the officiate
at my wedding.

10:35.219 --> 10:36.929
Local musician?

10:37.054 --> 10:38.848
Local legend.
I used to come hear you

10:38.973 --> 10:40.808
play every week
at the Deerhead.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.685
Dude, you're on TV.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.313
You're the sportscaster
on Channel Seven.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.023
Go, Eagles!

10:47.315 --> 10:48.691
You do that on TV.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.192
You guys mind
if they join us?

10:50.401 --> 10:52.028
No.
Yeah, sure.

10:52.570 --> 10:54.947
Guys, I've got some
instruments right here.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.407
Hey, why don't you
and me play those?

10:56.574 --> 10:57.742
Yeah?

10:57.825 --> 10:58.951
Okay, this is awesome.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.244
What shall we play?

11:00.328 --> 11:02.413
Maybe we should warm up
with some scales?

11:02.496 --> 11:04.123
Midnight Rambler?
Yeah.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.167
Midnight what?

11:13.382 --> 11:16.344
Have you heard about
the midnight rambler?

11:20.765 --> 11:22.641
Hey, this is crazy

11:53.297 --> 11:56.050
Hey, I was talking to Cathy.
Turns out she is single.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.677
Oh, I stand corrected.

11:58.928 --> 12:01.514
I thought it might be fun
to set her up with someone.

12:01.597 --> 12:02.932
Any ideas?

12:03.641 --> 12:05.893
Oh. You know who might be good?
Mike Tibbets.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.062
Mike Tibbets, really?

12:08.145 --> 12:09.480
Hey, who's this
Mike Tibbets guy?

12:09.647 --> 12:10.981
What kind of
car does he drive?

12:12.400 --> 12:13.442
Not his mom's car.

12:13.526 --> 12:15.986
Yeah, because his mom's car's
probably not a Nissan Z.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.490
TouchÃ©?

12:22.159 --> 12:23.661
Kelly, calm down.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.246
I mean, I guess
he'd be okay with hair.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.164
Okay, you should see
if he'll get hair plugs.

12:27.331 --> 12:28.707
I don't think Jim
cares about his hair.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.209
Yeah, but I do, Pam. Okay?

12:30.292 --> 12:31.460
It's called
being a nice person.

12:31.585 --> 12:32.753
I don't see what's
so ugly about him.

12:32.837 --> 12:34.463
He's got the broad
face of a brewer.

12:35.256 --> 12:36.674
Jim's on to me.
Hmm?

12:37.383 --> 12:39.343
Yeah, Jim barely
talks to Mike.

12:39.427 --> 12:40.803
We had to go through
like two levels

12:40.886 --> 12:42.263
of friends to even
find his profile.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.433
Jim picked someone
just unattractive

12:45.558 --> 12:47.852
enough to shut me up
without tipping it.

12:48.394 --> 12:50.604
Just ugly enough
to have deniability.

12:50.688 --> 12:52.148
Yup.

12:52.523 --> 12:55.526
Mike Tibbets is like the
most boring looking guy I know.

12:55.609 --> 12:59.613
So if that was for the Matchmaker
Test, I think I'm in the clear.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.659
If that wasn't for
the Matchmaker Test then...

13:03.742 --> 13:05.828
Cathy, he's a really
nice guy.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.705
Well, Jim may be
lying with his words,

13:07.830 --> 13:09.582
but he can't
lie with his body.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.293
I'm going to write
something mean on his wall.

13:12.376 --> 13:13.961
No, Kelly, don't.

13:14.044 --> 13:15.379
The male reveals attraction

13:15.463 --> 13:18.632
through unconscious and
involuntary physical signs.

13:18.716 --> 13:20.593
The puffing of the chest.

13:20.676 --> 13:21.719
Mirroring.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.221
Increased blood flow
to the crotch.

13:25.264 --> 13:26.891
I say we start there.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.058
With the crotch?
With the crotch?

13:28.392 --> 13:30.060
With the crotch.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.992
Whoo!

13:46.869 --> 13:47.953
Psst.

13:48.037 --> 13:49.663
We're not here.
Who said that?

13:49.747 --> 13:51.123
Exactly.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.666
How'd I get
this long triangle?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.084
Okay, just shut up.

13:54.752 --> 13:56.754
Is he puffing out his chest?

13:56.921 --> 13:58.923
I can't tell.
It's unnaturally sunken.

14:01.592 --> 14:04.261
Busted. He just was
mirroring. Did you see that?

14:04.345 --> 14:06.555
No. Maybe he just
said something funny.

14:06.639 --> 14:09.808
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam.
You should know that.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.894
I think he's just
making her laugh.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.687
Time for me to find out.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.817
Why is he making
her laugh so much?

14:18.943 --> 14:20.694
Just going to
walk over here. Whoa!

14:20.778 --> 14:24.323
I'm slipping and falling! I'm stumbling.
I need something to grab onto!

14:24.406 --> 14:25.366
Hey, are you okay?
I'm fine.

14:25.449 --> 14:26.700
Dwight! Dwight!
I'm totally fine!

14:26.784 --> 14:27.785
Yes?

14:28.702 --> 14:29.828
What? Jim?

14:29.954 --> 14:31.121
Sorry about that.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.582
Cramp. I'm just...
Dwight!

14:35.417 --> 14:36.752
Why?

14:36.835 --> 14:39.755
I'm sorry,
I fell down, Mr. Balance.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.182
Leave.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.980
Does your husband
ever have soft erections?

14:56.105 --> 14:59.733
Because if not, I just grabbed
a very soft penis for nothing.

15:00.276 --> 15:02.778
Why was he making
her laugh so much?

15:08.576 --> 15:09.785
Hey, I'll just be a second.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.662
Yeah, take your time.
Okay.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.041
That line from Zoolander.
Mmm-hmm?

15:16.458 --> 15:18.794
It was from a deleted scene
so we were both right.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.129
Told you.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.924
Do I hand in
my expense reports

15:24.008 --> 15:25.384
to a particular
accountant or...

15:25.467 --> 15:27.177
Oscar, Cathy
has a question.

15:27.428 --> 15:30.055
Sorry, I'll just
go ask Oscar.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.770
Yeah?
You okay?

15:36.854 --> 15:38.772
Why won't you just admit
that she's attractive?

15:38.856 --> 15:40.149
It's kind of annoying
that you won't say it.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.026
Okay, what can I do
to make you believe me?

15:42.860 --> 15:45.654
Well, Dwight had this idea and I
thought it was kind of crazy,

15:45.738 --> 15:47.364
but maybe that's
where we are now.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.536
She called it crazy? Man.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.330
That's insulting.
All I did was

15:54.413 --> 15:56.081
propose a makeshift
lie detector test.

15:56.165 --> 15:58.042
Monitoring his
blood pressure, pulse,

15:58.125 --> 15:59.960
perspiration and
breathing rate.

16:00.294 --> 16:03.714
Yeah, it's nuts. But I don't
know what else to do.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.091
And she called it nuts?

16:06.342 --> 16:08.385
Seriously,
that was hot.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.888
Feel like you and the
newsman had a groove going.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.223
Did you know that Lisa
toured with Chaka Khan?

16:13.390 --> 16:14.892
Are you serious?

16:14.975 --> 16:16.435
From Star Trek?

16:16.560 --> 16:18.062
Hey, you caught
some of that?

16:18.437 --> 16:19.438
I caught it.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.481
What, you don't like the Blues?

16:20.564 --> 16:22.816
I might enjoy seeing
you guys play the Blues.

16:22.900 --> 16:23.984
Well, we are playing.

16:24.068 --> 16:26.654
We're all playing together.
These are our jam buddies.

16:26.737 --> 16:29.406
It's a jam session. We go
where the music takes us.

16:30.783 --> 16:32.910
I think the music
left without you.

16:38.374 --> 16:39.708
Come on.
Stop shoving me.

16:39.792 --> 16:42.753
"Stop shoving me. Stop
grabbing my penis." Grow up.

16:43.295 --> 16:45.506
Take off your jacket
and take a seat.

16:47.174 --> 16:50.552
When it lies, the human body
exhibits many telltale signs.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.555
Really?
This could all go away

16:53.639 --> 16:55.516
if you just
tell me the truth.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.476
Are you all in line?

16:57.893 --> 17:00.270
Why don't you go check out
the sympathy cards, old man?

17:00.437 --> 17:03.107
Now I'm going to ask you
just a few simple questions.

17:03.190 --> 17:06.485
Wait for this to
constrict. Here we go.

17:06.777 --> 17:08.195
Is your name Jim Halpert?

17:08.320 --> 17:09.780
Si.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.701
Wait, that's it? That's the
question you're going to ask him?

17:13.867 --> 17:15.244
We have to start
with a baseline question

17:15.327 --> 17:16.662
to establish
what the truth is.

17:16.912 --> 17:20.040
You have to share
the machine with others.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.126
Well, that's
what they taught me

17:22.209 --> 17:23.752
in my 19th
century kindergarten.

17:23.836 --> 17:26.547
Okay, Dwight, come on.
You can go first.

17:27.464 --> 17:28.549
Jim, are you serious?

17:32.928 --> 17:35.431
You know what? This reminds me,
Cece needs a new toothbrush.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.403
Maybe we could
switch instruments.

17:49.528 --> 17:50.863
Yeah.

17:50.946 --> 17:53.198
'Cause my body's
starting to get bruised.

17:53.657 --> 17:56.660
Yeah, maybe everyone move one
instrument to the right.

18:11.842 --> 18:14.511
We had to leave because
of creative differences.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.139
Yeah, they kind of
had a specific sound

18:17.264 --> 18:19.683
that didn't really
fit in with our thing.

18:19.767 --> 18:24.605
Guys, this means they're
Kevin and the Zits now.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.191
No, man. We are.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.903
Well...
I know, I know.

18:31.195 --> 18:32.821
Okay, you're done.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.531
I have a new
heart, you know.

18:34.698 --> 18:37.451
Do you really,
Tin Man? Okay.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.661
Where were we?

18:39.745 --> 18:41.205
No, I'm not worried.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.166
Because this lie isn't
for me, it's for Pam.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.586
And when she gets her body
back and her confidence back,

18:49.046 --> 18:51.673
yes, I will tell
her the truth.

18:52.508 --> 18:53.801
That...

18:54.384 --> 19:00.182
I had feelings for a co-worker
today that I haven't had in years.

19:02.768 --> 19:04.603
In my defense,
he was grabbing my crotch

19:04.728 --> 19:06.605
fairly aggressively
at the time.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.649
Do you find
Cathy Simms attractive?

19:08.774 --> 19:10.067
No.

19:13.362 --> 19:14.655
Yep, he's lying-

19:15.280 --> 19:16.615
See. Was that so hard?

19:16.990 --> 19:17.991
I am not lying.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.034
Really?

19:19.117 --> 19:22.120
Pam, are you really going to listen
to his stupid homemade test?

19:22.204 --> 19:23.664
I would listen to
my homemade test

19:23.747 --> 19:25.207
because your husband
is definitely lying.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.752
In fact, he's lied about every
question, even his name.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.921
Who are you, really?
Wait, what?

19:31.004 --> 19:34.299
Look at the numbers. Every single
time it's come up 150 over 100.

19:34.383 --> 19:36.510
Your husband is
a pathological liar.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.262
Jim, you have
high blood pressure.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.138
He is definitely
attracted to her.

19:40.389 --> 19:41.598
Doesn't your dad have
high blood pressure?

19:41.765 --> 19:42.975
Yeah, but I don't smoke.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.434
When was the last time
you went to the doctor?

19:44.560 --> 19:46.311
I don't know. It's important
to go every month

19:46.395 --> 19:47.813
and get your
prostate checked.

19:47.896 --> 19:48.939
You can do it at
home by yourself

19:49.106 --> 19:50.148
with your finger.
You just stick...

19:50.232 --> 19:51.316
Okay.

19:51.441 --> 19:52.568
Dwight, stop.

19:53.110 --> 19:56.822
I'm not kidding. I mean, I need
you to take care of yourself.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.240
What would we do if
something happened to you?

19:58.323 --> 20:01.785
Okay, easy. Trust me.
I'm around for the long haul.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.872
It's not really your choice, though, is it?
Death waits for no man.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.248
Okay.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.416
Come on, let's go.
I want to call your doctor.

20:09.293 --> 20:12.170
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest
that Jim is not his real name?

20:12.254 --> 20:13.297
Just go home,
it doesn't matter.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.548
But the...

20:14.798 --> 20:17.301
Hey, Cece's toothbrush.

20:20.888 --> 20:21.972
Thank you.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.975
<i>Ooh,
baby, I love your way</i>

20:25.893 --> 20:27.311
Every day

20:28.645 --> 20:31.857
Want to be
with you night and day

20:32.816 --> 20:34.276
And day

20:34.568 --> 20:37.279
<i>Ooh, baby, I love your way</i>
