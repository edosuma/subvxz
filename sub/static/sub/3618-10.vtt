WEBVTT

00:02.972 --> 00:04.646
She's supposed to be here by now.

00:04.893 --> 00:07.250
- So she's a little late.
- No, she's a lot late.

00:07.522 --> 00:10.164
Paige used to be the first one
to a vanquish. What's wrong with her?

00:10.445 --> 00:12.836
She's in love. That's hardly wrong.

00:13.117 --> 00:15.793
It is when it interferes with
her responsibilities as a Charmed One.

00:16.081 --> 00:17.960
Why don't you just let me
handle this one alone.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.282
Because you've handled
the last four vanquishes alone.

00:20.549 --> 00:22.303
You should have
never let them move out.

00:22.552 --> 00:24.624
Hey, you don't see me complaining,
I'm happy for them.

00:24.890 --> 00:26.370
And you should be too.

00:26.601 --> 00:28.992
So where is this demon
and what's its name?

00:29.273 --> 00:30.263
No one knows its name.

00:30.484 --> 00:33.160
And it's too strong
for one witch to handle alone.

00:34.031 --> 00:35.910
How much longer
is this gonna take?

00:36.161 --> 00:38.552
Go see what Phoebe's doing.

00:40.336 --> 00:41.611
- Where'd he go?
- Hong Kong.

00:41.839 --> 00:46.121
Hong Kong? This is the last time
I work crowd control for you guys.

00:50.565 --> 00:52.842
Hi.

00:53.112 --> 00:55.628
Oh, how's Wyatt?
I miss him so much.

00:55.909 --> 00:57.788
He misses you too.
Is this a bad time?

00:58.036 --> 01:00.154
No, this is a great time.
Jason's away at a conference.

01:00.418 --> 01:04.620
I was just practicing my origami.
This is a tiger. You can have that.

01:06.052 --> 01:09.525
- I'm sorry I didn't visit.
- No, no, don't be silly.

01:09.851 --> 01:12.526
You've obviously been
really busy folding.

01:12.816 --> 01:14.888
I'm sorry I have to
ask for your help, but...

01:15.153 --> 01:16.474
No, it's okay.

01:16.699 --> 01:18.817
I mean, if you don't
enter the tiger's cave,

01:19.077 --> 01:20.956
you may never get the cub, right?

01:21.374 --> 01:23.253
- Come again?
- Ancient Chinese proverb.

01:23.504 --> 01:26.259
Means "nothing ventured,
nothing gained," you know?

01:26.719 --> 01:28.438
- Can we get the show on the road?
- Sure.

01:28.682 --> 01:30.834
- Okay.
- Keep that.

01:31.436 --> 01:34.272
Look, when the safety hazard's clear,
you can go to work.

01:34.566 --> 01:36.638
- Just be patient, okay?
- Yeah, easy for you to say.

01:36.903 --> 01:39.465
- I got four mouths to feed.
- Yeah, me too.

01:39.743 --> 01:40.972
- Got that right.
- Yeah.

01:41.204 --> 01:42.684
Okay, what do you
want me to do?

01:42.916 --> 01:45.193
You're the bait.
All you gotta do is levitate into the air.

01:45.462 --> 01:46.896
And when this demon
senses your magic,

01:47.132 --> 01:48.487
it's gonna come fast and hard.

01:48.969 --> 01:50.005
Okay.

01:50.222 --> 01:54.060
Be careful of my origami.
That tiger took two fricking hours.

01:54.398 --> 01:55.832
Okay, let's do it.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.078
- What was that?
- What was that?

02:18.902 --> 02:20.656
All clear.

03:20.022 --> 03:23.415
Maybe you should just take me
out back and hose me down.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.214
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry I'm late.
Did I miss the vanquish?

03:26.490 --> 03:28.130
- Ask her.
- Hi, hi, hi.

03:28.371 --> 03:29.566
Hey.

03:29.790 --> 03:31.669
- Oh, my God, Phoebe, how are you?
- Great.

03:31.919 --> 03:33.832
- How's Jason?
- He's great. How's Richard?

03:34.090 --> 03:37.642
He's fabulous. He was taking his time
getting out of the house this morning.

03:37.972 --> 03:39.008
That's why I couldn't orb.

03:39.224 --> 03:40.817
Wait, you don't orb
with him in the house?

03:41.062 --> 03:43.259
She's asked Richard
to not use his magic.

03:43.525 --> 03:45.279
So I'm trying to be supportive
and, you know,

03:45.529 --> 03:47.442
not use my magic in front of him.

03:47.699 --> 03:51.616
A magic-free life. You're the last witch
in the world I'd expect that from.

03:51.957 --> 03:55.032
It's not magic-free,
it's just magic-light.

03:55.339 --> 03:57.616
Yeah, it's still a lot to give up.

03:57.885 --> 04:02.645
What I get from him kind of
more than makes up for it, I think.

04:04.149 --> 04:06.301
- How's Hong Kong?
- It's fascinating.

04:06.569 --> 04:09.723
I'm studying numerology
and the Chinese zodiac.

04:10.034 --> 04:13.951
But, you know, distant waters
doesn't quench the immediate thirst.

04:15.796 --> 04:18.915
- Ancient Chinese proverb.
- It just means that I miss my family.

04:19.219 --> 04:21.291
Well, that's good,
because your family misses you too.

04:21.557 --> 04:23.629
I mean, I don't have a lot of people
to hang out with,

04:23.895 --> 04:26.013
aside from my baby,
who doesn't really say much,

04:26.273 --> 04:28.505
and then
one really neurotic whitelighter.

04:29.114 --> 04:31.152
Yeah, how is my little buddy Chris?

04:31.410 --> 04:33.482
Last time I saw him,
he wasn't in such good shape.

04:33.747 --> 04:36.661
He's trying his best to hide it,
but he's still really shaken up.

04:36.962 --> 04:40.275
Well, he lost his fianc?e, you know?
I don't blame him, it's huge.

04:40.593 --> 04:42.825
There's something in the future
that's freaking him out.

04:43.097 --> 04:45.819
Yeah, he's more determined than ever
to protect Wyatt from evil,

04:46.104 --> 04:48.017
which means there's
a new demon hunt every day.

04:48.275 --> 04:50.268
I feel like such a bad sister,

04:50.530 --> 04:52.807
leaving you guys alone
to handle all this.

04:53.076 --> 04:54.830
No, no. We're fine.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.756
Wyatt and I actually enjoy
having the manor to ourselves.

04:58.044 --> 04:59.797
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean,

05:00.048 --> 05:03.600
we have room to spread out,
and life is very quiet and calm,

05:03.932 --> 05:06.768
and, best of all,
everything stays clean.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.863
If I'm gonna hang out,
I better change my clothes.

05:16.121 --> 05:18.957
- I think I left some here.
- I'll go with you.

05:29.021 --> 05:31.662
You know, being born under
the Year of the Ox is a good thing.

05:31.942 --> 05:34.823
It means you're
a natural-born leader.

05:35.116 --> 05:37.154
- What happened to my room?
- Holy...

05:37.414 --> 05:41.047
I guess when Piper said she was
gonna spread out, she wasn't kidding.

05:41.379 --> 05:43.178
But where's all my stuff?

05:43.424 --> 05:46.863
I mean, I have stuff, you know.
Lots and lots of stuff.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.934
Well, being an Ox,
I can take charge of this.

05:49.184 --> 05:52.702
You can borrow something from
my room until we straighten this out.

05:56.740 --> 05:57.730
Oh, hi, baby.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.221
This one too?

06:00.456 --> 06:02.130
Yeah, you move,
you lose it in this family.

06:02.378 --> 06:04.131
You could lose a lot more
than a bedroom.

06:04.381 --> 06:06.499
Hi, Chris, I'm fine,
thank you. And you?

06:06.762 --> 06:08.800
It's his job to offer his opinion.

06:09.057 --> 06:12.018
You know, the only reason she's even
here is Paige missed the vanquish.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.834
- Another one?
- Yeah.

06:14.066 --> 06:15.626
That makes, what,
five in a row now?

06:15.862 --> 06:17.775
You guys are such nags.

06:18.033 --> 06:19.353
When did you two
become so chummy?

06:19.577 --> 06:20.567
We're not chummy.

06:20.789 --> 06:22.382
He's gone through
a lot protecting Wyatt,

06:22.624 --> 06:25.778
and I figure, instead of doubting him,
I should help him a little.

06:27.132 --> 06:29.204
So, what do you guys think?
You like Wyatt's new room?

06:29.680 --> 06:33.153
I like it. I just like my room too.

06:33.479 --> 06:35.836
And I like it, I just like my room too.

06:36.108 --> 06:38.784
Well, you guys were the ones
that moved out, not me.

06:41.412 --> 06:42.641
So where are my clothes?

06:45.128 --> 06:50.331
Oh, God. This is really
kind of hitting home.

06:50.722 --> 06:53.636
- What's that?
- Well, that I don't live here anymore.

06:54.521 --> 06:55.637
I know what you mean.

06:55.856 --> 06:59.773
At Richard's, it just doesn't
feel like home yet, you know?

07:00.113 --> 07:02.549
I don't know, I guess
I just had more fun here.

07:02.827 --> 07:04.944
Yeah, because this place is a riot.

07:06.083 --> 07:11.446
No, I just... I don't know, I guess
I'm more free here. "Free to be me."

07:11.846 --> 07:15.808
Oh, wow, Phoebe,
these are some boots.

07:16.146 --> 07:19.345
No, they're not mine, but I wish
they were, because they're hot.

07:19.653 --> 07:22.044
The box says "Penny."
Penny, as in "Grams" Penny?

07:22.324 --> 07:23.314
No way.

07:23.534 --> 07:26.050
I refuse to believe that Grams
ever wore anything this hot.

07:26.331 --> 07:29.006
Yeah, I figured her
more for steel-toed orthopaedics.

07:29.294 --> 07:31.606
You know, the better
to kick your ass with.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.604
They're your size, Paige.
Try them on.

07:33.846 --> 07:37.159
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, just do it.

07:37.478 --> 07:39.869
They're kind of '60s.

07:40.150 --> 07:41.470
So, what's wrong with the '60s?

07:41.695 --> 07:45.850
The '60s was, like,
the worst fashion era. Hello.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.800
Bad clothing, bad hair,

07:49.084 --> 07:52.397
and extremely questionable
personal hygiene.

07:54.595 --> 07:56.030
Hey, they fit.

07:57.726 --> 07:59.559
Hey, where'd she go?

08:08.413 --> 08:09.403
Pardon me...

08:09.623 --> 08:12.537
Hold on, I'm adjusting my aura.

08:12.838 --> 08:14.956
You know how those
blocked chakras can get.

08:17.389 --> 08:18.869
There.

08:20.019 --> 08:23.537
You brought my go-go boots.
Right on.

08:23.861 --> 08:25.933
Actually, they brought me.

08:26.198 --> 08:28.156
That's because I cast
a return-to-owner spell

08:28.410 --> 08:29.890
on all my favourite stuff.

08:30.121 --> 08:31.442
I'm always taking my clothes off

08:31.666 --> 08:33.703
and forgetting them somewhere
these days.

08:33.962 --> 08:37.799
- Excuse me, who are you?
- Penny.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.159
Penny.

08:40.558 --> 08:42.278
As in...

08:43.900 --> 08:46.655
..."Penny Halliwell" Penny?
- Yeah.

08:46.947 --> 08:49.782
- Who are you?
- I'm Paige. I'm your gr...

08:52.247 --> 08:54.479
I'm your grandest fan.

08:56.046 --> 08:57.799
I've heard so much about you.

08:58.301 --> 08:59.974
Far out.

09:00.222 --> 09:02.533
Far out.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.979
You have no idea how far out.

09:07.027 --> 09:09.304
The whitelighters
are putting on a light show.

09:09.781 --> 09:13.619
Come on, Paige,
you don't wanna miss this.

09:13.957 --> 09:15.677
What do you mean, you lost Paige?

09:15.919 --> 09:17.148
Well, it was really weird.

09:17.380 --> 09:21.263
I mean, one second she was here,
and the next second:

09:21.596 --> 09:24.671
It kind of happened after she
put on a pair of Grams' boots.

09:24.978 --> 09:27.175
Grams cast spells on her clothes
when she was young.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.082
Wait, you knew Grams
when she was young?

09:29.320 --> 09:32.679
Yeah, we crossed paths once or twice
when I was a young whitelighter.

09:34.454 --> 09:36.925
Well, I barely remember it.

09:38.587 --> 09:40.659
Well, if the boots did belong
to your grandmother,

09:40.925 --> 09:43.726
we better summon her from the dead.
Maybe she can tell us what happened.

09:44.014 --> 09:46.484
- Okay, let's get the candles.
- But you...

09:46.770 --> 09:47.965
Yeah.

09:48.191 --> 09:50.388
- Really groovy.
- Pretty groovy.

09:50.654 --> 09:52.692
Out of sight.

09:55.580 --> 09:57.651
I'm Robin, by the way.

09:57.917 --> 09:59.192
So, what do you think?

10:01.299 --> 10:03.769
Oh, my God, is that Leo?

10:06.558 --> 10:09.758
- You know him?
- I thought I did.

10:16.787 --> 10:19.587
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

10:19.877 --> 10:22.519
What are all these people
doing here?

10:22.799 --> 10:25.953
Oh, they're not just people.
They're witches.

10:26.263 --> 10:28.221
With a few whitelighters thrown in.

10:28.477 --> 10:31.711
I don't suppose any of them know
how to open a time portal, do they?

10:32.025 --> 10:34.462
Anything's possible
when you free your minds.

10:34.738 --> 10:37.334
That's why we're gathering
here tonight, for a magical be-in.

10:37.785 --> 10:39.299
Oh, like a human be-in.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.614
When Timothy Leary said,
"Tune in, turn on, drop out"?

10:42.920 --> 10:45.311
No, there's no acid allowed
in the manor, Paige.

10:45.592 --> 10:47.504
We're all on a contact high.

10:47.763 --> 10:49.322
I'm not on drugs.

10:49.559 --> 10:52.122
I'm just having a bad trip.

10:52.398 --> 10:55.233
How do you know what's
gonna happen at the Human Be-In?

10:55.529 --> 10:57.441
It's tomorrow at Golden Gate Park.

10:57.951 --> 11:00.387
I just kind of know things.

11:00.957 --> 11:02.994
Like I know I wanna go home.

11:03.252 --> 11:07.168
- Do you have an active power?
- Yeah, I can orb.

11:08.053 --> 11:09.487
Groovy.

11:09.723 --> 11:12.159
Hey, everyone, we have
a witch here who can orb.

11:12.435 --> 11:14.155
- Groovy.
- Right on.

11:14.773 --> 11:17.243
Lay some orbs on us, sister.

11:19.909 --> 11:22.664
Fine, if it'll help me
get out of here.

11:23.918 --> 11:25.592
Big, fat tape thingy.

11:28.341 --> 11:32.304
Oh, my powers must be down.
Must be the past.

11:33.769 --> 11:38.324
Past few minutes. This patchouli oil,
it's really making me light-headed.

11:38.695 --> 11:40.288
Performance anxiety.

11:40.532 --> 11:42.445
Listen, if you want
some private coaching,

11:42.704 --> 11:44.583
there's an empty room upstairs,
you dig?

11:44.832 --> 11:47.633
No, I don't dig.

11:49.215 --> 11:52.369
- You okay, honey?
- Yeah.

11:53.015 --> 11:55.133
I don't know how I'm gonna
get home without my magic.

12:01.156 --> 12:03.353
I've never seen so many witches

12:03.618 --> 12:05.975
just hanging out.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.969
Wait till the magical be-in.

12:08.212 --> 12:10.205
This house was built
on a spiritual nexus.

12:10.466 --> 12:14.907
We're gonna tap into its power tonight
and ride the magic wave.

12:15.266 --> 12:18.146
Are you sure
you're Penny Halliwell?

12:21.569 --> 12:23.368
Everything on schedule for tonight?

12:23.616 --> 12:26.452
They're lining up
like lambs to the slaughter.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.261
Oh, it's gonna be a massacre.

12:30.254 --> 12:34.490
I wish we could take them out now.
I can't stand these peace-Iovers.

12:34.846 --> 12:36.520
Just keep it together
a little while longer.

12:36.766 --> 12:38.998
We want this place packed.

12:39.271 --> 12:42.346
And I see a few new arrivals
since my last visit.

12:42.820 --> 12:46.019
This one's dressed a little strange,
don't you think?

12:46.327 --> 12:48.797
- Where's she from?
- I don't know.

12:49.082 --> 12:51.200
- She just got here.
- Well, keep an eye on her.

12:51.462 --> 12:54.981
The attack takes place
on schedule tonight.

12:56.097 --> 12:59.888
And if you need anything,
I'll be close by.

13:02.733 --> 13:05.488
So, what do you say, Paige?
Join us tonight?

13:05.781 --> 13:08.344
You know, as much as I
consider myself a free spirit,

13:08.619 --> 13:10.292
I really can't.
I need to go home.

13:10.541 --> 13:13.660
If there's any way that you can help
me write a spell so I can find my way...

13:13.965 --> 13:16.083
Oh, Allen's back.

13:24.192 --> 13:26.913
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:32.958 --> 13:33.948
Where's Patty?

13:34.168 --> 13:37.243
I dropped her off at my sister's.
She's gonna crash there tonight.

13:37.551 --> 13:38.541
Patty, like "Mom" Patty?

13:39.847 --> 13:41.999
I mean, you're a mom.

13:44.272 --> 13:46.469
- Janice?
- Excuse me?

13:46.734 --> 13:48.169
I just came back
from my sister's pad,

13:48.406 --> 13:50.842
and for a second I thought
I was looking at her again.

13:51.411 --> 13:54.166
Paige, this is my old man, Allen.

13:54.457 --> 13:56.575
He's not a witch,
but he's cool with it.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.752
- Allen, your first husband.
- My first and only.

14:00.053 --> 14:01.568
I'm not that into free love.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.324
Listen up, I passed this groovy
drum circle on my way here.

14:04.604 --> 14:06.756
- Who wants to check it out?
- Count me in.

14:07.025 --> 14:08.539
I think I'm gonna
do some light reading.

14:08.777 --> 14:10.849
<i>Is your Book of Shadows
in the attic?</i>

14:11.114 --> 14:13.346
I swear, it's like you could
be my sister.

14:13.621 --> 14:15.214
Or your granddaughter.

14:15.457 --> 14:21.254
If you had a granddaughter, that is,
which you won't unless I get home.

14:21.677 --> 14:23.077
You can't leave now.

14:23.306 --> 14:25.060
We need as many witches
as possible tonight.

14:25.309 --> 14:27.700
She's right, Paige, come with us.

14:27.982 --> 14:30.259
Who wants a ride
on the rainbow bus?

14:41.132 --> 14:42.965
You know, if I hadn't
taken over Paige's room,

14:43.220 --> 14:45.497
this never would've happened.
This is all my fault.

14:45.766 --> 14:47.644
- What's done is done.
- What's done is done.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.014
Okay, you two really need
to get a room.

14:51.278 --> 14:52.268
Yeah.

14:52.488 --> 14:55.323
<i>Hear these words, hear my cry
Spirit from the other side</i>

14:55.619 --> 14:58.898
<i>Come to thee, I summon thee
Cross now the great divide</i>

15:08.980 --> 15:11.450
Well, it's about time
you called to say hello.

15:11.984 --> 15:14.181
Oh, how are my darlings?

15:15.073 --> 15:17.145
We got a problem.

15:17.830 --> 15:20.027
Well, you're not the only one.

15:20.292 --> 15:22.364
- Orb out.
- No, magic makes it grow.

15:22.629 --> 15:24.349
Summoning her spirit
already gave it power.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.984
Oh, you must be Chris,
the new whitelighter.

15:30.269 --> 15:32.831
You know, he doesn't look
very qualified for the job.

15:33.108 --> 15:35.500
- Chris, just let me blast it.
- She's right. Orb.

15:35.781 --> 15:37.135
For heavens' sakes, listen to them.

15:37.366 --> 15:40.327
We'll find a way
to vanquish the foul thing later.

15:41.709 --> 15:42.745
Now.

15:54.735 --> 15:57.935
You and Paige moved out?

15:58.239 --> 16:01.120
- When?
- A few weeks ago.

16:01.413 --> 16:02.733
But we're handling everything.

16:02.956 --> 16:06.395
Dear, you have Paige
stuck in the past

16:06.715 --> 16:08.708
and a demonic blob
roaming the manor.

16:08.970 --> 16:11.725
Exactly how are you
handling things?

16:12.017 --> 16:14.408
We're still in an adjustment period.

16:14.688 --> 16:18.570
There would be no adjustment period
if you were living under one roof.

16:18.905 --> 16:21.660
Why in heaven's name
did you move out?

16:21.954 --> 16:23.547
To be with Jason.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.673
You said it yourself,
"never give up on love." Remember?

16:27.964 --> 16:29.478
I didn't say give up on your sisters.

16:29.718 --> 16:32.871
And you. You're the oldest,
how could you let them move out?

16:33.182 --> 16:35.539
You know, it really wasn't that hard,

16:35.812 --> 16:38.727
because they deserve a shot
at a normal life.

16:39.027 --> 16:40.097
They're not normal, Piper.

16:40.322 --> 16:42.599
And neither are you.
When are you going to learn that?

16:42.868 --> 16:44.588
Well, I guess never.

16:46.585 --> 16:49.385
All this over men.

16:50.216 --> 16:52.573
How many times have I told you,
men are utensils.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.835
You use them, wash them,

16:54.057 --> 16:56.174
and throw them in a drawer
until you need them again.

16:59.568 --> 17:00.718
Everyone, quiet.

17:05.912 --> 17:07.632
I can hear it.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.334
I think it's in the wall.

17:14.471 --> 17:17.146
Yeah, it's in the wall.

17:17.435 --> 17:20.349
We need Paige. It took the power
of three to vanquish it in the future.

17:20.650 --> 17:22.209
What?

17:22.444 --> 17:25.645
If you knew that, why didn't
you tell me that in the first place?

17:25.952 --> 17:28.344
I could barely get two of you
together, let alone three.

17:28.624 --> 17:31.299
Besides, it's not that big right now.
I thought two could handle it.

17:31.587 --> 17:32.942
Leo, you take point.

17:33.174 --> 17:35.690
Chris here is much too green
to guide my girls.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.329
What? You know what,
you can just stop that right...

17:38.603 --> 17:39.593
Quiet.

17:40.815 --> 17:42.728
It's time to give
this floundering ship a rudder.

17:42.986 --> 17:45.741
Now, which boots did Paige put on?

17:46.031 --> 17:47.751
Red. Go-go boots.

17:48.496 --> 17:49.566
We've got a problem.

17:49.915 --> 17:52.226
Those boots took Paige back
to the Summer of Love,

17:52.504 --> 17:55.067
which was one of the most
crucial times of my life.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.571
What do you mean, crucial?

17:56.803 --> 17:59.194
Your grandfather Allen, rest his soul,
was a sweet man,

17:59.475 --> 18:01.945
but he led me straight down
the hippie-dippie trail.

18:02.439 --> 18:05.036
- You were a flower child?
- Yeah, well, don't rub it in.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.679
What's important is that
Allen was killed by my best friend.

18:08.993 --> 18:11.111
I didn't know it then,
but she was evil.

18:11.373 --> 18:13.013
And I walked in
right after it happened.

18:13.254 --> 18:14.370
What did you do?

18:14.589 --> 18:18.745
Well, let's just say that
my peacenik days ended fast.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.025
Along with that bitch Robin.

18:21.267 --> 18:24.626
- If she hadn't killed Allen...
- You'd still be a flower child.

18:25.359 --> 18:27.272
And the Charmed Ones
would be dead.

18:28.573 --> 18:30.166
I know I'm a ball-buster.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.049
But it kept me alive
to protect my girls

18:32.287 --> 18:35.680
from all the demons
that came after them as kids.

18:38.134 --> 18:40.696
I cast my return-to-owner spell
on a lot of clothes that summer.

18:40.973 --> 18:42.533
- So...
- So we get to go back there?

18:42.894 --> 18:44.487
And we get to meet
our grandfather?

18:44.730 --> 18:47.087
Don't make too much out of it,
because whatever you do,

18:47.360 --> 18:50.912
you can't change the past
or tell anyone you're from the future.

18:51.243 --> 18:53.885
- Well, why does he get to?
- Because I know what I'm doing.

18:55.501 --> 18:56.776
Not from where I'm standing.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.724
I'll stay here with Leo and the newbie
to contain the slime

19:00.009 --> 19:02.446
until you can bring Paige back
to vanquish it, okay?

19:02.722 --> 19:07.322
Okay, girls, get dressed.
You are going to the Summer of Love.

19:10.404 --> 19:12.795
<i>Hear the drums.</i>

19:13.201 --> 19:17.996
<i>Liquid beats crashing down
On parched shores</i>

19:18.378 --> 19:24.778
<i>Pounding like the feet of 10,000
soldiers Whispering "why?"</i>

19:25.559 --> 19:28.554
- Why?
- Right on.

19:38.082 --> 19:40.803
Sorry, I just got a little carried away.

19:41.255 --> 19:43.133
Don't be sorry, that was gone.

19:43.385 --> 19:44.661
- Gone, that's right.
- Hey, Robin!

19:44.889 --> 19:46.323
That's exactly
what I should be, gone,

19:46.558 --> 19:50.840
because I'm actually
starting to dig... Like this.

19:51.192 --> 19:54.186
It's kind of cool,
everybody being so free.

19:54.491 --> 19:55.560
Robin, come here.

19:56.161 --> 19:59.395
You are exactly
what we're all about, Paige.

19:59.708 --> 20:01.189
Do you wanna hear my dream?

20:02.003 --> 20:05.841
I dream of a crusade
to rid the world of evil.

20:06.180 --> 20:10.097
Not through fighting or the inner anger
that makes us wanna fight,

20:10.437 --> 20:13.272
but through the magic power of love.

20:13.567 --> 20:16.561
Are you sure you're Penny Halliwell?

20:17.159 --> 20:19.995
- How long have you felt this way?
- Ever since I met Allen.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.886
It must be so great
to share this together.

20:24.465 --> 20:25.865
Your old man's not into magic?

20:26.093 --> 20:28.484
He's not so old,

20:28.764 --> 20:30.996
but no, not so into it either.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.664
Hey, groovy girl,
we've been looking for you.

20:36.947 --> 20:38.905
Welcome. I'm Penny.

20:39.159 --> 20:41.277
Any friends of Paige's
are friends of ours.

20:41.539 --> 20:43.896
But you shouldn't
use magic so openly.

20:44.169 --> 20:45.490
That's Grams.

20:46.005 --> 20:47.645
I'm Allen. Peace and love.

20:47.885 --> 20:51.483
Oh, yes, love. Lots and lots of love.

20:51.810 --> 20:54.452
I have so much love for you, man,
you have no idea.

20:54.732 --> 20:56.645
You here for the happening
at the manor tonight?

20:56.903 --> 20:59.978
No, we were just looking
for our friend Paige, actually.

21:00.285 --> 21:01.605
Excuse us.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.903
- So glad you guys found me.
- We need to get out of here.

21:08.927 --> 21:11.124
It's the pigs.

21:12.015 --> 21:14.052
Okay, everybody, let's break it up.

21:14.312 --> 21:16.269
Let's go, everybody out. Move it.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.804
This is a park, man.
You can't control God's green earth.

21:20.115 --> 21:22.347
It's the taxpayers' green dollars
that pay for this park.

21:22.619 --> 21:25.420
And you're loitering, so move it.

21:25.709 --> 21:28.829
<i>Hell, no, we won't go
Hell, no, we won't go</i>

21:29.131 --> 21:32.171
<i>Hell, no, we won't go
Hell, no, we won't go</i>

21:32.804 --> 21:36.004
<i>They have no right
They have no power</i>

21:36.311 --> 21:39.944
<i>Turn their hate sticks into flowers</i>

21:44.327 --> 21:46.797
Let's jam. If the cops catch us,
we'll miss tonight.

21:47.084 --> 21:50.477
- Piper, freeze them.
- I can't.

21:51.134 --> 21:53.650
- Come on, let's go.
- Paige, come on. Come on.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.401
No way, man.

21:58.061 --> 22:00.497
If what's happening tonight
at the manor is what I think it is,

22:00.777 --> 22:02.575
this might be the night
that Grandpa dies.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.214
Let's just hope that Paige
tries to get us out of here first.

22:05.494 --> 22:07.964
I don't wanna be raised by
that flower child we saw in the park.

22:08.249 --> 22:10.321
- We'd never make it to puberty.
- You don't own me!

22:10.586 --> 22:13.980
You think you own me, but the Man
will never own Luther Morris.

22:14.302 --> 22:18.184
- I said, keep it down.
- No.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.638
What are you two looking at?

22:24.281 --> 22:27.002
Please, there's gotta be a way
to get my friends out of jail.

22:28.874 --> 22:33.235
Stay cool, Paige.
We've all been hassled by the pigs.

22:33.673 --> 22:34.948
It's a rite of passage.

22:36.803 --> 22:39.080
They'll let your friends go...

22:39.350 --> 22:40.865
...after a night in jail.

22:41.271 --> 22:43.833
Okay, everybody,
time to prepare for the party.

22:44.109 --> 22:47.741
Take a crystal, bless it
and hide it outside the manor.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.592
- We wanna form a perimeter.
- What are those?

22:50.874 --> 22:52.024
Those are pyrite crystals.

22:52.251 --> 22:54.847
They resonate a harmonic tone
when exposed to evil.

22:55.592 --> 22:57.824
Kind of like
a demonic alarm system.

22:58.389 --> 23:01.782
- How did you know?
- I was taught by the best.

23:02.438 --> 23:05.194
I thought our gathering tonight
was a peaceful one.

23:05.777 --> 23:09.615
I wanna give peace a chance as much
as anyone, Robin, but I'm not dumb.

23:10.202 --> 23:12.240
You know how many covens
are coming tonight?

23:12.498 --> 23:15.857
- We'll be sitting ducks.
- Right.

23:20.096 --> 23:22.248
I would really love it
if my friends could come tonight.

23:22.516 --> 23:25.795
If there's anything
that we can do to help them...

23:26.108 --> 23:30.424
Tell you what, I got a friend
who's an ACLU lawyer.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.503
I'll call him...

23:32.998 --> 23:34.911
...right after we set the crystals.

23:35.752 --> 23:37.472
Thank you.

23:38.048 --> 23:41.647
The way I see it,
we're all targets for the slime.

23:41.973 --> 23:44.728
We need a plan to control it
until the girls get back.

23:45.019 --> 23:47.899
In the future, everyone tried
to control the demon with no name.

23:48.192 --> 23:51.345
- But it can't be done.
- That's hardly a winning attitude.

23:51.656 --> 23:53.888
And why in heaven's name
couldn't the people in the future

23:54.162 --> 23:55.312
find some name for that thing?

23:55.540 --> 23:58.057
Speaking of the future, what's
so awful that happens to Wyatt?

23:58.338 --> 24:00.251
- I can't tell you that.
- Come on, I'm an Elder.

24:00.508 --> 24:03.628
Excuse me, back on point.
The slime?

24:03.932 --> 24:07.484
- I'm taking suggestions.
- We could orb it to an ice drift.

24:07.815 --> 24:10.810
- No, that's bad.
- It's not bad, it's awful.

24:11.112 --> 24:13.423
You can't orb that thing,
it feeds on magic.

24:13.700 --> 24:16.819
- So, what's your great idea?
- Are you giving me lip?

24:17.123 --> 24:18.842
No.

24:19.087 --> 24:20.407
No!

24:30.149 --> 24:31.742
Hold on.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.311
I think it stopped.

24:38.581 --> 24:40.061
Get Wyatt out of the house.

24:40.294 --> 24:44.176
If it tries to follow, I'll fire off
an orb or two to distract it.

24:44.510 --> 24:47.391
- You okay with that?
- Yeah, it's just what I had in mind.

24:47.683 --> 24:49.277
Okay.

25:07.931 --> 25:10.128
- Any sign of Paige?
- Nope.

25:10.394 --> 25:13.867
We're not gonna reach her
before Grandpa's attacked.

25:16.155 --> 25:19.275
- Should we try a spell?
- Why not? Let's try a spell.

25:19.577 --> 25:22.538
Leave it to the Man to lock
the brother up with the crazies.

25:26.718 --> 25:30.191
<i>Come to me and be seduced
I have a girl to introduce</i>

25:30.517 --> 25:35.880
<i>Fall for her, you can't resist her
Trust me, mister, she's my sister</i>

25:36.277 --> 25:38.190
- Why me?
- Because he's not my type.

25:41.370 --> 25:43.840
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:44.291 --> 25:46.523
You know what I think is really hot?

25:47.631 --> 25:48.907
A guy in a cage.

25:49.888 --> 25:52.279
Yeah. Why don't you
come in here with me.

25:52.559 --> 25:54.950
All right.

26:00.115 --> 26:02.472
Take off your shirt.

26:02.746 --> 26:04.978
Hey, hey, hey.

26:05.250 --> 26:07.049
Luther don't wanna see this.

26:07.672 --> 26:11.987
Put this on. You're gonna
lead us to freedom, Luther.

26:12.389 --> 26:14.108
A brother could get used to this.

26:15.396 --> 26:17.115
So could a brother's son.

26:19.194 --> 26:20.833
There's my little
psychedelic sunshine.

26:21.072 --> 26:23.269
Are you ready
for your private session?

26:23.535 --> 26:26.848
Yeah. Real soon.
Have you seen Allen?

26:27.167 --> 26:29.730
He was supposed to call
his lawyer friends for me.

26:30.006 --> 26:33.888
My name is Leo.
Like the zodiac sign.

26:34.223 --> 26:37.262
Astrologically speaking,
Leo represents the sun.

26:37.565 --> 26:41.481
Constantly burning
and highly energetic.

26:42.447 --> 26:45.088
Okay, starshine.

26:45.369 --> 26:47.167
Could you just please
point me in the direction

26:47.413 --> 26:49.451
where I might find Allen?

26:52.299 --> 26:53.972
Thank you.

26:55.930 --> 26:58.321
<i>And so I call upon the Crone</i>

26:59.063 --> 27:03.026
<i>Let evil roam inside this home</i>

27:03.363 --> 27:05.356
I thought you were acting strange.

27:08.498 --> 27:10.217
Allen.

27:10.460 --> 27:14.093
- Are you spying on me?
- How could you, Robin?

27:14.593 --> 27:16.267
What about our dream?

27:16.513 --> 27:19.268
My only dream
is helping my warlock friend

27:19.561 --> 27:22.680
put all of you weak creatures
out of your misery tonight.

27:23.986 --> 27:25.545
Robin.

27:28.286 --> 27:30.518
Violence isn't the answer, Robin.

27:31.751 --> 27:34.392
Let love replace your fear.
I know you've felt our love.

27:34.672 --> 27:39.033
Yeah, and I still got
the stink of it all over me.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.145
Over here!

27:50.037 --> 27:51.312
Allen.

27:53.377 --> 27:54.606
All right.

27:54.837 --> 27:57.912
- What did I just do?
- Oh, nothing much.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.496
Just changed our entire future.

28:00.764 --> 28:01.800
Or erased it.

28:04.730 --> 28:05.959
What did it do, split in half?

28:06.192 --> 28:08.149
- How do we get out?
- I don't know.

28:09.241 --> 28:10.471
Orb?

28:10.703 --> 28:13.857
The last time I orbed,
that thing almost swallowed me whole.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.638
- What do you think, Penny?
- I think love conquers all.

28:18.968 --> 28:24.366
I think that we should take the demon
into our arms and make it feel safe.

28:33.369 --> 28:35.601
Leo, can I talk to you
for a second, please?

28:36.292 --> 28:38.728
Do you mind holding him
for a second?

28:39.005 --> 28:42.205
Of course. Come here, moonbeam.

28:42.513 --> 28:46.146
Wyatt. His name is Wyatt.

28:48.483 --> 28:50.236
One of the sisters
must have changed the past,

28:50.486 --> 28:52.478
because Penny clearly
never made the change

28:52.742 --> 28:55.942
from flower child to demon hunter.

28:56.666 --> 29:01.300
<i>We shall not
We shall not be moved</i>

29:01.676 --> 29:05.194
Clearly. Think the girls can
fix the timeline and get back here?

29:12.403 --> 29:13.439
I don't know.

29:13.657 --> 29:15.694
But this thing's
trying to back us into a corner.

29:17.289 --> 29:21.332
Take Wyatt and Joan Baez here
into the conservatory.

29:21.673 --> 29:23.950
I'll gather what we need
to fight it off.

29:29.854 --> 29:32.849
Has anyone seen Robin?
We got a lot of...

29:34.280 --> 29:36.591
- What happened?
- Robin, she attacked.

29:36.869 --> 29:39.624
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.

29:40.167 --> 29:42.603
She said something about
a warlock attacking tonight.

29:42.881 --> 29:45.351
So? That's no problem,
you have a house full of witches.

29:45.636 --> 29:48.915
Piper's right. You could all take on the
warlocks. All you have to do is fight.

29:49.226 --> 29:52.346
That's not who we are.
We don't believe in murder.

29:52.649 --> 29:53.799
No, neither do we.

29:54.027 --> 29:55.781
But we do believe
in vanquishing evil.

29:56.030 --> 30:00.107
I'm sorry, I don't see violence
as a solution to anything.

30:00.456 --> 30:01.936
I thought
you understood that, Paige.

30:02.168 --> 30:05.163
- I thought you were one of us.
- Let's go. Let's send everyone home.

30:05.465 --> 30:08.107
I don't want anyone else
getting hurt.

30:09.264 --> 30:11.985
Oh, she is driving me nuts.

30:12.271 --> 30:14.263
That is not the Grams we all know.

30:14.526 --> 30:17.281
The Grams we know
found her husband dead tonight.

30:17.572 --> 30:20.772
I know we're supposed to turn her
into a bit of a killer or whatever,

30:21.077 --> 30:25.519
but what if this happens to be
her new destiny? With Grandpa.

30:25.881 --> 30:28.795
If Grandpa was supposed to die tonight,
death will come after him again.

30:29.095 --> 30:33.615
The first thing we have to remember
is we're not here to change anything.

30:33.978 --> 30:35.253
We just need to keep Grams alive,

30:35.482 --> 30:37.201
and unfortunately,
we don't have our powers.

30:37.610 --> 30:39.807
Well, it's a lot thinner
than we're used to,

30:40.074 --> 30:44.309
but I'm sure we could find something
in here to help us make a potion.

30:44.666 --> 30:47.023
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

30:47.297 --> 30:49.574
I'll be downstairs
on warlock watch.

30:50.178 --> 30:51.294
Why isn't it attacking?

30:51.514 --> 30:54.235
It's like it cornered us
and now it's just waiting.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.672
I think we need the toaster oven.

30:59.862 --> 31:02.332
You know, that's a disaster
waiting to happen.

31:02.617 --> 31:03.733
That's the idea.

31:03.953 --> 31:06.071
You saw how the slime
reacted to the electricity.

31:06.333 --> 31:10.125
Well, if we can get it to attack this pile,
maybe we can get it to zap it.

31:10.466 --> 31:12.265
If I could find a place to plug it in.

31:12.511 --> 31:14.663
No offence, but, you know,
my dear Allen

31:14.934 --> 31:17.086
would have taken the path
of peaceful resistance.

31:17.982 --> 31:20.418
Have you tried talking to the slime?

31:21.488 --> 31:23.401
No, I haven't,
and you shouldn't either.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.431
But if you're up
for some conversation,

31:25.662 --> 31:27.973
maybe you wanna tell me
what happens to Wyatt in the future.

31:28.251 --> 31:29.367
Nice try.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.062
Got it.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.034
Damn it.

31:36.266 --> 31:39.865
I told you boys,
violence is not the answer to anything.

31:40.191 --> 31:42.866
- Where's the fuse box?
- It's in the basement.

31:43.155 --> 31:45.273
You'll find a flashlight
in the laundry room.

31:56.557 --> 31:57.593
Leo.

31:59.729 --> 32:01.243
What is it? What is it?

32:01.482 --> 32:03.952
The slime, in the basement,
feeding on nexus.

32:04.239 --> 32:05.798
How big was it?

32:14.131 --> 32:17.284
- Big.
- Yeah. Big.

32:19.810 --> 32:23.488
- We were going to make history.
- I know, honey.

32:25.988 --> 32:30.110
- We need to talk.
- I agree.

32:30.790 --> 32:32.065
We need to talk with the warlock

32:32.292 --> 32:37.211
and find a path of peaceful resistance
to resolve this situation.

32:37.593 --> 32:40.827
The first thing my Grams taught me
was not to reason with demons.

32:41.142 --> 32:45.856
- Your grandmother fought demons?
- Yeah, she was a great woman.

32:46.235 --> 32:50.072
And she knew that you can't
reason or negotiate with demons.

32:50.409 --> 32:54.804
They kill. And they keep killing
until a force of good stops them.

32:55.170 --> 32:57.447
If your grandmother
hurt other living creatures,

32:57.717 --> 33:00.553
she doesn't sound so great to me.
I'm sorry.

33:00.847 --> 33:02.122
Penny's right.

33:02.349 --> 33:04.785
You can't be a saviour
and a murderer at the same time.

33:05.064 --> 33:08.901
Really? What if a demon
attacked somebody you loved?

33:09.239 --> 33:11.516
Like your daughter?

33:11.785 --> 33:13.617
Would you fight then?

33:16.293 --> 33:18.205
Where are all the witches?

33:18.465 --> 33:20.697
Where in the hell
are all the witches?

33:22.054 --> 33:23.170
Where are they?

33:23.391 --> 33:26.431
Well, that depends on
who you're looking for.

33:26.730 --> 33:30.123
- Everybody.
- We sent them home.

33:31.323 --> 33:33.680
The manor's yours.
We won't fight you.

33:37.293 --> 33:38.932
Do something.

33:39.589 --> 33:42.549
<i>May peace and love
From the moon above</i>

33:42.845 --> 33:45.965
<i>Flow through your heart
On the wings of a dove</i>

33:49.315 --> 33:51.547
Did you just try
and cast a love spell on me?

33:53.700 --> 33:55.578
I'm a warlock.

33:56.039 --> 33:57.473
What is this world coming to?

34:02.215 --> 34:03.569
No!

34:09.938 --> 34:11.293
No.

34:13.237 --> 34:16.597
- Allen.
- Your turn to join him, sweetheart.

34:17.829 --> 34:18.945
Hey.

34:26.889 --> 34:29.485
- I think he's gone.
- For now.

34:32.607 --> 34:34.438
- This isn't right.
- What do you mean?

34:34.695 --> 34:37.688
Grams flew into a rage
when she found Grandpa dead.

34:37.994 --> 34:39.507
It made her what she was.

34:39.746 --> 34:42.103
Does that look like
a demon killer to you?

34:45.882 --> 34:49.036
If the demon comes at us,
I'll try to hold it off with this.

34:53.899 --> 34:56.654
Don't be afraid of us.
We won't hurt you.

34:56.947 --> 34:57.937
Penny, get back.

35:06.174 --> 35:07.928
How are you so calm right now?

35:08.178 --> 35:11.332
It's okay for you to be angry.
That warlock killed your husband.

35:11.641 --> 35:13.520
I am angry.

35:14.064 --> 35:15.977
At myself.

35:16.359 --> 35:19.354
That's why I'm mixing
a binding potion.

35:19.656 --> 35:21.171
Binding your magic
is not the answer.

35:21.411 --> 35:25.407
It is for me.
I tried to save Allen and I failed.

35:25.754 --> 35:28.509
What good is my magic
if it can't save my family?

35:28.801 --> 35:31.716
It's a lot of good.
Remember your dream?

35:32.015 --> 35:34.896
You can't turn your back on it now.
What would Allen think?

35:35.188 --> 35:36.748
Doesn't matter, he's dead.

35:36.983 --> 35:38.463
No one will ever compare to him.

35:39.030 --> 35:42.867
I'll probably end up hating men
for the rest of my life.

35:43.203 --> 35:45.435
- Well, she's got us there.
- Magic can save your family.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.381
I mean, my sisters have saved...

35:49.882 --> 35:53.276
You said these were your friends.
What's going on? Who are you?

35:55.184 --> 35:59.181
- Don't. Can't change history.
- It's a little late now, isn't it?

36:00.862 --> 36:02.775
We're your granddaughters.

36:04.871 --> 36:07.832
- Hi, Grams.
- I'm your Grams?

36:08.128 --> 36:09.562
The demon hunter?

36:09.797 --> 36:13.794
Yeah, and these fancy boots
brought me from the future.

36:14.139 --> 36:16.940
- And these earrings.
- And this ring.

36:17.228 --> 36:20.462
- No, you're trying to trick me.
- No, afraid not, Grams.

36:20.775 --> 36:23.212
Look, it's payback time.
You need to get your act together.

36:23.489 --> 36:25.925
We love you, but if you don't
start fighting now,

36:26.202 --> 36:27.956
all the people we're meant to save...

36:31.756 --> 36:33.271
You didn't think I forgot about you?

36:34.637 --> 36:35.912
Those were our potions.

36:42.319 --> 36:45.233
Wyatt's in the living room. No sign
of the demon in the rest of the house.

36:45.533 --> 36:48.254
I think it was distracting us before
so it could feed on nexus.

36:48.537 --> 36:50.291
- What about Penny? Is she?
- I don't know.

36:57.889 --> 36:59.482
I can't keep up with it,
we gotta get out.

36:59.727 --> 37:01.286
No, we have to keep fighting.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.831
That's what Penny
would want us to do.

37:10.205 --> 37:12.596
Not quite the slaughter I expected.

37:12.877 --> 37:15.678
But it'll have to do for a night's work.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.687
Stop.

37:19.223 --> 37:22.298
What are you gonna do?
Cast another love spell?

37:26.987 --> 37:28.387
Well, it's about time.

37:28.616 --> 37:33.011
Like you said, Piper, it's okay to fight
for someone you love, right?

37:37.592 --> 37:39.789
Welcome back
to your destiny, Grams.

37:42.853 --> 37:44.765
Now she's just showing off.

37:45.441 --> 37:47.638
Okay, the grandfather clock.

37:54.332 --> 37:56.005
What do I usually do at this point?

37:56.253 --> 37:59.133
You usually do something very final,
if you catch my drift.

38:02.473 --> 38:05.309
<i>Snuff this warlock
His days are done</i>

38:05.938 --> 38:09.696
<i>But make him good
For the ecosystem</i>

38:13.286 --> 38:15.722
Now, that's what you call
flower power.

38:19.756 --> 38:22.511
Not exactly ruthless, but a fine start.

38:22.804 --> 38:24.158
That was for Allen.

38:25.477 --> 38:27.276
So now what?

38:27.522 --> 38:29.241
Now we gotta get home fast

38:29.484 --> 38:32.239
because we have a slimy demon
of our own to deal with.

38:32.531 --> 38:35.731
- How are we gonna do that?
- Grams just has to reverse the spell.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.637
Glad to know
I have groovy grandkids.

38:39.921 --> 38:44.476
Just the same, I think I'm gonna work
on a forgetting spell for after you go.

38:44.846 --> 38:48.603
- You know, keep the cosmic order.
- Oh, I like this Grams.

38:48.938 --> 38:51.249
I don't want to forget you.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.191
- Get out of here, go.
- No, not without you.

38:59.458 --> 39:02.338
- This thing's gonna swallow you whole.
- Most likely.

39:04.385 --> 39:05.535
Stand back, fellas.

39:05.761 --> 39:09.440
<i>Drawing on the power of three
Destroy this evil entity</i>

39:21.794 --> 39:24.310
- Where's Wyatt?
- He's in the living room.

39:24.589 --> 39:25.819
What about Grams?

39:30.310 --> 39:32.063
She didn't make it.

39:36.948 --> 39:41.024
Nonsense. You can't damage
an old warhorse like me.

39:41.375 --> 39:43.173
I'm already dead.

39:43.419 --> 39:46.653
Yay, Grams.
I'm so glad you're back.

39:50.642 --> 39:52.919
Hey there, sun god.

39:53.188 --> 39:57.071
Hey, that was a long time ago.
Let's just keep that between us, okay?

39:57.738 --> 40:01.576
Hey, I wanna thank you two
for not giving up the fight.

40:02.414 --> 40:04.406
I'm really proud of you boys.

40:05.127 --> 40:06.847
You did good.

40:13.852 --> 40:15.252
Grams gone?

40:15.481 --> 40:18.396
Yes, but not before
yelling at us for moving out.

40:18.695 --> 40:21.770
It was good to hear her
yell at us for a change.

40:22.077 --> 40:23.797
So did she convince you
to move back in?

40:24.040 --> 40:28.037
No, but she did give us her blessing
after she was done yelling.

40:28.382 --> 40:31.057
- Really?
- Well, she gave up a lot to be a witch.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.987
- You know, she lost Grandpa.
- And her dreams.

40:34.267 --> 40:36.339
I don't think she wants that
to happen to us.

40:36.604 --> 40:39.519
But she did make me promise
that I would keep in touch more.

40:39.818 --> 40:43.292
And I have to promise
to keep using my magic.

40:44.538 --> 40:47.338
I guess Grams really is
a softie underneath it all.

40:47.626 --> 40:50.939
- So you guys going home?
- Home is a relative term.

40:51.259 --> 40:52.693
But, yeah, we're heading out.

40:52.929 --> 40:55.730
No, I should get back
and finish my origami dragon.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.897
Yeah, I understand.

40:59.985 --> 41:01.863
Well, you guys know
you always have a home here.

41:02.113 --> 41:07.111
And a room when you want it back.
I mean, if you want it back.

41:32.715 --> 41:34.628
Everything all right?

41:34.885 --> 41:36.843
No, it's not.

41:37.098 --> 41:40.377
I mean, I know it seems to them
that I'm moving on with my life

41:40.687 --> 41:44.764
and everything's fine,
but it's not true.

41:45.112 --> 41:46.786
I wish they were still here.

41:47.034 --> 41:51.077
- You should tell them that.
- No. I shouldn't.

41:51.418 --> 41:54.652
I should just go to bed.
Good night.

41:54.965 --> 41:56.480
Good night.

42:02.188 --> 42:03.338
Good night, moonbeam.
