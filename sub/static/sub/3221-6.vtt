WEBVTT

00:04.021 --> 00:06.642
It's Sam, Bobby.
He's just-He's different.

00:06.814 --> 00:09.852
- Something's not right to me.
- I can't just lose you and Ben.

00:10.235 --> 00:13.022
Me and Ben will be here,
and you come when you can.

00:13.197 --> 00:14.228
Come in one piece.

00:14.406 --> 00:16.446
Think we can pull
something like that off?

00:16.617 --> 00:17.648
It's worth a shot.

00:27.461 --> 00:30.877
Just tell me
what the hell is going on.

00:33.759 --> 00:35.170
Dean?

00:35.344 --> 00:37.882
Ben, just stay there.
I said stay back!

00:40.599 --> 00:42.093
Cure's an old Campbell recipe.

00:50.943 --> 00:53.813
At least, uh, you got my back.

00:54.238 --> 00:56.859
No matter what,
I can always count on you. Right?

00:57.032 --> 00:59.025
Of course, Dean.

01:04.915 --> 01:07.073
He said he'd call. But he never did.

01:07.251 --> 01:11.200
But I don't know.
I just-We had such a good time.

01:11.380 --> 01:13.123
I should call him. Right? You think?

01:13.298 --> 01:16.917
I mean, should I call him?
I don't know. It's-Oh, uh-

01:17.469 --> 01:20.043
Oh, Olivia? Just hold on a sec.

01:22.224 --> 01:24.845
- I just need the truth. That's all.
- Ahem.

01:26.145 --> 01:27.473
I gotta go. Call you later.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.137
I pity you. I'm sorry?

01:31.316 --> 01:33.226
You're sad and pathetic and I pity you.

01:33.402 --> 01:37.815
Only reason I'm giving you the head's
up. Stay away from the clam chowder.

01:40.242 --> 01:42.780
I flavored it with my own seasoning.

01:50.794 --> 01:53.997
Hey, Jane, you know that new girl,
Misty?

01:54.173 --> 01:55.252
Way hotter than you.

01:55.924 --> 01:58.213
- Excuse me?
- Basically, she's an eight...

01:58.385 --> 02:01.172
and you're a-A three.

02:07.519 --> 02:10.473
- Can I get you anything else, ma'am?
- No, thank you.

02:10.646 --> 02:13.185
I ran over a homeless man once...

02:13.358 --> 02:18.601
and I never even stopped
to see if he was alive.

02:27.039 --> 02:28.948
I hate Mommy.

02:29.124 --> 02:31.117
I wanna burn her in her sleep.

02:31.293 --> 02:34.994
I don't know what it is,
but you just give me the creeps.

02:35.172 --> 02:37.129
Like I get physically nauseous.

02:37.299 --> 02:39.292
You're pathetic. Loser.

02:39.468 --> 02:42.173
Desperate. Stupid.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.008
Mousy.

02:44.181 --> 02:46.220
You're a desperate, pathetic loser.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.058
You're gonna die alone.

02:49.728 --> 02:51.886
Hey. Can you come get me?

02:52.064 --> 02:54.555
<i>You sound
awful. Have you been drinking?</i>

02:54.733 --> 02:57.817
I think I'm going crazy.
I'm freaking out.

02:57.986 --> 03:01.355
<i>Of course you are.
Because you are a freak.</i>

03:01.532 --> 03:03.109
<i>You're certifiable.</i>

03:03.283 --> 03:06.237
<i>Every time the phone rings
my stomach drops.</i>

03:06.411 --> 03:08.784
<i>Jane with another crisis.</i>

03:08.956 --> 03:10.498
<i>You're a walking disaster.</i>

03:10.666 --> 03:13.536
<i>The whole family's just waiting
for your next big breakdown.</i>

03:13.710 --> 03:15.169
<i>We're like hostages.</i>

03:15.337 --> 03:17.958
<i>Why don't you just go ahead
and kill yourself already?</i>

03:34.648 --> 03:36.475
<i>I know what I saw.
We tested him.</i>

03:36.650 --> 03:38.808
Salt, silver, everything.

03:38.986 --> 03:42.485
He threw me to that vamp.
I'm telling you, it's not my brother.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.696
Then, he's something
we ain't seen before.

03:44.867 --> 03:46.195
Or it's freaking Lucifer.

03:46.368 --> 03:49.155
<i>Did you call Cass?
Of course. He's not answering.</i>

03:49.329 --> 03:53.707
- But screw him. I can't wait any more.
- Look, I get it. You're rattled.

03:53.876 --> 03:56.497
You're right to be.
But let's be professional-

03:56.670 --> 03:59.873
Professional?
He watched me get turned.

04:00.048 --> 04:02.753
What you saw.
Are you sure that's what you saw?

04:02.926 --> 04:04.504
Damn it, Bobby. Yes. I know.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.549
"You know" ain't the same as proof.

04:07.723 --> 04:10.593
<i>- Because we're talking about-
- Doing something about it, fast.</i>

04:10.767 --> 04:13.555
It's not just the vamp.
He's been different from the jump.

04:14.938 --> 04:16.183
All right, I'm with you.

04:16.356 --> 04:18.396
- Are you?
- Yeah. I'll hit the books, hard.

04:18.567 --> 04:22.185
Just don't shoot him yet, all right?
Watch him.

04:22.362 --> 04:23.987
<i>We need facts.</i>

04:24.156 --> 04:27.607
Because if it ain't Sam,
we don't know what it is.

04:27.784 --> 04:30.026
If we put him down,
we need to know how.

04:30.787 --> 04:33.575
I don't wanna ride in the same car,
much less work a case.

04:33.749 --> 04:36.287
Get in the car. He's your case.

04:41.256 --> 04:44.091
Hey.
I was just leaving Lisa a message.

04:44.635 --> 04:46.295
- Still hasn't called you back?
- No.

04:46.470 --> 04:47.845
- Sucks.
- Yeah.

04:48.013 --> 04:49.507
You okay?

04:50.724 --> 04:53.049
Yeah. I'm fine. How are you?

04:53.560 --> 04:56.230
Me? Great.
Here, look, check this out.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.934
Ahem. Think it might be something.

04:59.566 --> 05:02.353
Four people, out of nowhere.
All in the last couple weeks.

05:02.986 --> 05:04.694
What do you say?

05:06.824 --> 05:09.030
- Yeah. Sounds like a plan.
- Let's go.

05:17.376 --> 05:19.499
I don't understand.

05:20.003 --> 05:22.838
Why would federal investigators
be interested in a suicide?

05:23.006 --> 05:27.799
Well, um, it's a new,
more caring administration.

05:30.806 --> 05:32.181
I already told the cops.

05:32.349 --> 05:34.507
Jane was having a really bad day.

05:34.685 --> 05:38.433
So I did what any sister would do.

05:43.235 --> 05:44.694
I tried to cheer her up.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.569
Told her to hang in there.

05:50.284 --> 05:52.027
You know what a tell is?

05:54.163 --> 05:56.488
- Excuse me?
- It's a poker term.

05:56.665 --> 06:00.532
For when you're bluffing.
Like what you just did with your hair.

06:01.170 --> 06:03.625
- What are you trying to say?
- You're lying.

06:04.173 --> 06:08.419
- What?
- Tell us what you did to your sister.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.935
You're right. I was lying.

06:22.107 --> 06:27.018
I wanted to tell her,
"I love you, I'm here for you."

06:27.196 --> 06:32.901
But what came out was,
"You're a burden. Just kill yourself."

06:34.119 --> 06:39.493
Who says that? I just couldn't stop.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.541
- See anything in the house?
- No hex bags, no sulfur, no EMF.

06:46.715 --> 06:49.918
<i>- You?
- A tuba and an issue of Crochet Today.</i>

06:50.093 --> 06:52.501
So, what, already kind of suicidal?

06:52.679 --> 06:56.262
Right, and then big sis's taxicab
confession sends her over the edge.

06:56.433 --> 06:59.434
Question is, what made sis
open her mouth in the first place?

06:59.603 --> 07:01.975
Yeah, that is the question.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.193
Thanks. Can you grab us
some gauze, please?

07:17.371 --> 07:18.699
Mm-hm.

07:20.249 --> 07:22.040
Should have had you prescribe me
a Valium.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.996
Ha, ha. Just relax.

07:25.337 --> 07:27.080
It'll be fine.

07:27.256 --> 07:29.165
Gotta be honest, Paul.

07:29.341 --> 07:30.539
I don't wanna be here.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.918
You and most people. But you know
what? I don't take it personally.

07:35.097 --> 07:36.472
Okay, open up.

07:40.686 --> 07:42.678
You and Donna should come over
for supper.

07:42.855 --> 07:46.354
How long has it been?
There. Worst part's over.

07:46.525 --> 07:49.395
I'm not really into Donna anymore.
She's old.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.194
Your wife looks great for her age.

07:53.365 --> 07:55.441
Her saggy skin makes me wanna hurl.

07:56.702 --> 07:59.323
- I have urges, you know.
- Okay.

08:00.289 --> 08:03.740
Remember that camping trip I missed
because I was sick?

08:03.917 --> 08:07.002
Well, I wasn't.
I was just afraid to be around Melissa.

08:08.463 --> 08:10.421
My daughter, Melissa?

08:11.633 --> 08:16.794
But then, she spent the night
for Jill's slumber party, oh...

08:17.139 --> 08:19.381
and it just seemed so easy,
you know?

08:19.933 --> 08:21.048
What are you saying?

08:21.226 --> 08:23.978
It's not so much
I couldn't control myself...

08:24.146 --> 08:26.471
I just knew I wouldn't get caught.

08:27.483 --> 08:28.858
And I didn't get caught.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.040
Hey. You find anything?

08:49.211 --> 08:52.082
I've been up all night looking.
Nothing fits.

08:53.382 --> 08:56.087
- Awesome.
- You got anything else to go on?

08:56.260 --> 08:58.751
Yeah. My skin crawls
being in the same room with him.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.301
- Why don't you look that up?
- I'm working on it.

09:01.473 --> 09:04.925
I don't know how much longer I can
do this. Figure out what he is, fast.

09:05.102 --> 09:06.216
I'm trying.

09:06.395 --> 09:09.396
But Dean,
there's a worst case scenario.

09:09.565 --> 09:11.356
What? Satan's my co-pilot. I know.

09:11.525 --> 09:14.645
- Well, that'd be the other worst case.
- Well, then what?

09:15.487 --> 09:17.610
Maybe it's just Sam.

09:19.783 --> 09:21.064
- I gotta go.
- Dean.

09:21.243 --> 09:25.288
You got a day, Bobby,
and then I'm handling this.

09:50.063 --> 09:53.148
There was another one.
Yeah? What?

09:53.692 --> 09:56.444
Dentist drilled a guy to death.

09:57.446 --> 10:00.363
You mean,
the non-sexy kind of drilling, right?

10:00.532 --> 10:02.157
Fifty bucks says he's mixed up
in the crazy.

10:02.326 --> 10:03.868
- You think?
- Let's talk to him.

10:04.036 --> 10:07.239
Uh, why don't you go ahead?
I'll catch up.

10:07.414 --> 10:08.992
I'm gonna do a little research.

10:12.503 --> 10:14.045
- You sure?
- Yeah.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.122
We gotta know what we're up against.

10:22.805 --> 10:24.927
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

10:41.782 --> 10:43.276
Thanks a lot.

10:49.873 --> 10:52.543
- Anything from Marathon Man?
- Not exactly.

10:52.709 --> 10:55.283
He hung himself in his cell
before I could get to him.

10:55.504 --> 10:57.627
<i>Yikes.
But he was definitely involved.</i>

10:57.798 --> 10:59.672
Just got the scoop from his assistant.

10:59.842 --> 11:00.873
<i>Yeah? Yeah.</i>

11:01.051 --> 11:03.340
The stuff that his patient
was confessing to?

11:03.512 --> 11:05.339
I would have murdered him too.

11:05.597 --> 11:07.554
So root canal and Russian roulette.

11:07.724 --> 11:09.800
Uh, both of them,
it's like they were cursed.

11:09.977 --> 11:12.302
People compelled to
puke the truth all over them.

11:12.479 --> 11:14.935
Getting hit with the ugly truth
till you go postal?

11:15.107 --> 11:16.138
I'd call that a curse.

11:16.316 --> 11:18.558
I'm going to the morgue
to check out the body.

11:18.735 --> 11:20.977
<i>Why don't you take
the dentist's office?</i>

11:21.155 --> 11:22.863
Yeah. No problem.

12:20.088 --> 12:23.588
Jane and Dr. Conley. I heard. Awful.

12:23.759 --> 12:25.419
What do I have to do with it?

12:25.886 --> 12:27.879
You're the only thing
they have in common.

12:28.972 --> 12:31.179
Did they say anything to you?
Before they, uh...

12:31.350 --> 12:34.137
- Sorry. Not really.
- Right.

12:34.311 --> 12:36.469
I was just fishing.

12:37.147 --> 12:41.774
- Thanks.
- Hey, by the way, how about my horn?

12:43.028 --> 12:45.187
- Sorry?
- Stolen horn?

12:45.364 --> 12:48.281
Right. Yeah. We're working on it.
Well, I hope so.

12:48.450 --> 12:50.775
Thing's one in a billion.

12:52.913 --> 12:55.486
- What makes it one in a billion?
- It's a museum piece.

12:56.583 --> 13:00.332
Near as anyone can tell,
about a thousand years old.

13:02.464 --> 13:04.836
- Where's it from?
- No one knows.

13:05.008 --> 13:08.259
- When did it get swiped?
- About...

13:08.971 --> 13:13.015
two weeks ago. Same day Jane died.

13:24.987 --> 13:27.110
Castiel? Hello.

13:27.614 --> 13:31.030
Possible loose nuke down here.
Angelic weapon.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.028
Kind of your department.

13:33.912 --> 13:36.035
You hear that, Cass?

13:37.458 --> 13:39.664
- Hello, Dean.
- Are you kidding me?

13:39.835 --> 13:43.453
I've been on red alert about Sam,
and you come for some stupid horn?

13:43.630 --> 13:45.540
You asked me to be here, and I came.

13:45.716 --> 13:48.171
I've been asking you to be here
for days, you dick.

13:50.637 --> 13:52.595
I didn't come about Sam...

13:52.764 --> 13:54.923
because I have nothing to offer
about Sam.

13:55.100 --> 13:58.303
That's great, because for all we know
he's giftwrap for Lucifer.

13:58.687 --> 14:00.727
No, he's...

14:01.690 --> 14:03.979
He's not Lucifer.

14:04.234 --> 14:06.191
And how do you know that?

14:06.612 --> 14:10.609
If Lucifer escaped the cage,
we'd feel it.

14:14.077 --> 14:18.027
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know, Dean. I'm sorry.

14:19.958 --> 14:22.081
What happened to you, Cass?

14:22.711 --> 14:25.831
You used to be human,
or at least like one.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.297
I'm at war.

14:33.931 --> 14:39.934
Certain regrettable things
are now required of me.

14:42.064 --> 14:44.222
Gabriel's Horn of Truth?
That's a real thing?

14:44.399 --> 14:46.191
- Seen it?
- We think it's in town.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.483
Something's forcing people...

14:49.863 --> 14:52.900
Oh, well, you're welcome.

14:56.161 --> 14:57.537
It isn't the Horn of Truth.

14:58.580 --> 15:00.952
You were gone for two seconds.
Where did you look?

15:01.667 --> 15:02.746
Everywhere.

15:04.211 --> 15:05.835
Right.

15:06.922 --> 15:09.413
Well, nice seeing you, anyway.

15:09.967 --> 15:12.209
- Dean.
- What?

15:13.595 --> 15:15.837
About your brother.

15:16.765 --> 15:19.850
I don't know what's wrong with him,
but I do wanna help.

15:20.561 --> 15:22.767
I'll make inquiries.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.820
Yeah. Thanks.

15:41.290 --> 15:45.786
Now, I'd actually like to see
all the suicides that came in this week...

15:45.961 --> 15:47.503
not just Dr. Giggles.

15:50.966 --> 15:52.377
Is that gonna be a problem?

15:54.219 --> 15:56.461
Well, they're already gone.

15:56.638 --> 15:59.592
- As in transferred?
- Yeah, not exactly.

16:02.019 --> 16:03.762
Would you tell me what's going on?

16:03.937 --> 16:06.096
Or should I have a chat
with your supervisor?

16:09.485 --> 16:10.599
They're gone.

16:13.655 --> 16:16.906
As in "gone" gone?

16:25.375 --> 16:26.704
<i>Here's the facts.</i>

16:27.336 --> 16:28.616
<i>Tune in weekdays...</i>

16:28.796 --> 16:31.666
<i>for the newest edition
to our award-winning local team.</i>

16:31.840 --> 16:35.007
<i>Find out the truth
about your layaway program.</i>

16:35.761 --> 16:37.967
Another one?
Uh, no, thanks. I'm working.

16:42.059 --> 16:44.466
Hey. What's up?
All the bodies are gone.

16:45.896 --> 16:48.268
- What? Vanished?
- That's what the coroner said.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.555
But I got a lead.

16:49.733 --> 16:52.936
One of the missing bodies, she died
a week before everybody else.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.320
- Suicide?
- Reported as a car accident...

16:56.490 --> 17:00.155
- but no reason it couldn't have been.
- That would make her Patient Zero.

17:00.369 --> 17:03.619
Maybe. Whatever got this curse thing
rolling started with her.

17:03.789 --> 17:06.410
I'm at her place now.
Corner of Burnham and 159th.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.492
All right. Give me 10.

17:10.796 --> 17:11.993
I will have that other one.

17:13.257 --> 17:17.089
- Thought you were working.
- I am working up to it.

17:19.096 --> 17:22.714
- You okay?
- No, not really.

17:26.936 --> 17:28.894
On me.

17:29.064 --> 17:30.558
Anything else I can get you?

17:33.360 --> 17:36.563
I'd just like the freaking truth.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.617
But I'll settle for another one.

17:46.290 --> 17:48.247
Sometimes I think
I can't get pregnant...

17:48.417 --> 17:50.456
because God knows
my marriage is a sham.

17:53.547 --> 17:54.710
Why'd I say that?

17:56.467 --> 17:59.551
I mean,
I've been snorting oxy all day.

18:00.345 --> 18:01.543
Why'd I say that?

18:08.562 --> 18:10.768
I'm pretty sure I know.

18:16.070 --> 18:18.940
<i>I'm Ashley Frank with Frank Talk.</i>

18:19.114 --> 18:22.281
I gotta go. Thank you.

18:24.078 --> 18:27.114
I'm sitting like this
so you'll look at my breasts.

18:27.623 --> 18:30.743
I just bought them.
I need a lot of attention.

18:32.795 --> 18:34.668
Good luck with that.

18:46.725 --> 18:49.299
Hey.
Anything you're itching to tell me?

18:49.895 --> 18:51.971
Not really.

18:53.023 --> 18:56.357
- Sorry to disappoint.
- That's all right. I'm just testing a theory.

18:56.527 --> 18:59.148
<i>Well, I'm here hitting the books.</i>

18:59.321 --> 19:02.690
<i>While drinking a nice glass of milk
and watching Tori & Dean.</i>

19:02.866 --> 19:05.618
What? Wait. Who and Dean?

19:05.786 --> 19:08.870
Tori Spelling. I'm a huge fan.

19:09.039 --> 19:10.450
Girl's a real talent.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.875
It does work over the phone.

19:14.044 --> 19:17.627
You know what else?
I get a pedicure once in a while.

19:17.798 --> 19:19.506
At this nice Vietnamese joint.

19:19.675 --> 19:20.837
Okay, okay. Please stop.

19:21.009 --> 19:24.877
<i>This one girl, Nhung Phuong,
Name means Velvet Phoenix.</i>

19:25.055 --> 19:27.593
Tiny thing, but the grip on her.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.471
She starts on my toes,
and I feel like I am-

19:30.644 --> 19:34.689
Hey. Come on, man.
Now I'm scarred for life. Thank you.

19:34.857 --> 19:36.980
I never told anyone that.

19:37.317 --> 19:38.598
Why am I telling you?

19:40.195 --> 19:42.105
Maybe because you're my favorite.

19:42.489 --> 19:45.443
<i>Although Sam's a better hunter.
Lately, anyway.</i>

19:46.118 --> 19:48.573
Whoa.
Why the hell am I telling you this?

19:48.746 --> 19:50.738
- Because I'm cursed.
- Cursed?

19:50.914 --> 19:52.325
<i>Yes. How is it...</i>

19:53.292 --> 19:57.372
that half the time
you clean a mess, you end up dirty?

19:57.546 --> 20:00.037
This might be the best thing
that's happened in a while.

20:00.215 --> 20:01.875
What do you mean?

20:02.134 --> 20:03.509
Dean.

20:03.677 --> 20:06.168
Dean, what damn fool move
are you about to-?

20:06.346 --> 20:09.715
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

20:09.892 --> 20:11.884
My first girlfriend turned out to be a-

20:12.061 --> 20:13.305
No, no.

20:13.479 --> 20:14.558
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

20:22.404 --> 20:24.397
<i>It's Sam. Leave me a message.</i>

20:24.573 --> 20:26.731
Sam. It's me.
Listen, I'm on my way to you.

20:26.909 --> 20:29.910
But if you get this before then,
give me a call back.

20:30.079 --> 20:31.870
There's a few things I wanna ask you.

20:33.290 --> 20:36.326
So why is there an investigation
for a car accident?

20:37.002 --> 20:39.327
It wasn't an accident.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.999
Corey committed suicide.

20:43.801 --> 20:45.592
You know...

20:46.386 --> 20:47.881
I wondered.

20:53.060 --> 20:56.263
I'm sorry. I just-

20:58.190 --> 21:00.895
So you had some idea Corey
might have taken her own life?

21:02.736 --> 21:07.778
Well, she had been going through
a bit of a hard time lately.

21:07.950 --> 21:13.240
At school, and, um, her cat Mittens
had just run away.

21:14.706 --> 21:18.407
But really...

21:19.294 --> 21:20.539
it was her boyfriend.

21:21.338 --> 21:24.339
She was sure
that he was cheating on her.

21:24.508 --> 21:27.758
But he was just very good
at covering his tracks.

21:27.970 --> 21:30.757
Which of course made her
completely obsessed with-

21:30.931 --> 21:34.134
- Finding out the truth?
- Yeah.

21:34.852 --> 21:36.891
You mind if I check out her room?

21:56.248 --> 21:57.411
Hey.

21:57.916 --> 22:00.123
So I saw you called.

22:01.962 --> 22:04.251
Yeah, it's been crazy.

22:06.341 --> 22:08.630
Ben won't even talk about it.

22:12.389 --> 22:17.680
Lisa, I'm sorry. But this is actually
the worst time in the universe to talk.

22:17.853 --> 22:21.139
<i>- Can we do this later?
- You shoved my kid, Dean.</i>

22:21.315 --> 22:22.939
How about we do this now?

22:26.945 --> 22:28.605
It wasn't like that.

22:29.490 --> 22:31.316
Then how was it?

22:35.871 --> 22:37.116
I can't really explain.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.204
You wanna know the truth?

22:43.295 --> 22:45.169
Probably not.

22:46.423 --> 22:49.258
You've got so much buried in there...

22:49.676 --> 22:52.250
<i>and you push it down,
and you push it down.</i>

22:52.429 --> 22:56.842
Do you honestly think that you can go
through life like that and not freak out?

22:57.017 --> 23:00.137
Just, what, drink half a fifth
a night and you're good?

23:00.312 --> 23:04.808
- Hey, you knew what you signed up for.
- But I didn't expect Sam to come back.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.226
<i>And I'm glad he's okay, I am.</i>

23:07.403 --> 23:10.569
But the minute he walked through
that door, I knew it was over.

23:11.490 --> 23:15.819
<i>You two have the most unhealthy,
tangled-up, crazy thing I've ever seen.</i>

23:15.994 --> 23:18.830
<i>As long as he's in your life,
you're never gonna be happy.</i>

23:23.877 --> 23:27.163
That came out so much harsher
than I meant.

23:27.631 --> 23:29.588
It's not your fault.

23:30.217 --> 23:33.835
I'm not saying don't be close to Sam.
I'm close to my sister.

23:34.721 --> 23:38.173
But if she got killed, I wouldn't
bring her back from the dead.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.224
Okay, Lis.

23:41.103 --> 23:43.095
I'm not gonna lie.

23:43.439 --> 23:46.523
Okay, me and Sam, we've got issues.

23:46.692 --> 23:48.435
No doubt.

23:49.319 --> 23:52.024
- But you and Ben-
- Me and Ben can't be in this with you.

23:54.575 --> 23:56.283
I'm sorry.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.315
Sorry, Mittens.

24:35.157 --> 24:37.648
Hey, where you been?
I found something.

24:37.826 --> 24:41.160
- It can wait. We gotta talk.
- Yeah. What's up?

24:41.330 --> 24:45.992
There's a few thing I wanna ask you,
and, uh, you're gonna tell me the truth.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.493
Yeah, Dean. Of course.
What are you talking about?

24:49.671 --> 24:54.630
- Whoa. Are you saying you're...?
- I asked for the truth...

24:54.885 --> 24:56.593
and, you know, I'm getting it.

24:57.554 --> 24:59.796
So like I said,
I have a few questions for you.

25:01.975 --> 25:05.594
When that vamp attacked me,
why did you just stand there?

25:14.530 --> 25:15.692
I didn't.

25:20.536 --> 25:22.196
I froze.

25:23.831 --> 25:25.373
You froze?

25:25.541 --> 25:27.533
You've been Terminator
since you got back.

25:28.585 --> 25:29.914
I don't know, shock.

25:33.382 --> 25:35.421
And then it was too late.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.804
I feel terrible about it, believe me.

25:43.434 --> 25:47.383
Dean, I can't lie here.

25:48.897 --> 25:51.768
You think I would let something
like that happen on purpose?

25:53.444 --> 25:56.694
- You're my brother. How could you-?
- Okay.

26:02.327 --> 26:03.987
Okay.

26:04.663 --> 26:06.288
Sorry.

26:07.332 --> 26:10.037
I thought I saw something.

26:12.129 --> 26:14.003
I guess I was wrong.

26:15.549 --> 26:18.420
It's just been a really, really bad day.

26:19.762 --> 26:21.553
Hey, it's okay.

26:23.432 --> 26:26.386
I got your back, all right?

26:26.560 --> 26:27.723
I always have.

26:30.105 --> 26:31.184
Thanks, Sammy.

26:42.744 --> 26:44.903
So this was the chick's pet?

26:45.080 --> 26:48.200
- Well, she was obsessed.
- I think you mean crazy.

26:48.375 --> 26:53.749
All right. So cat skull, uh, grains of
paradise seed, devil's shoestring.

26:53.922 --> 26:57.006
Mix them well, you got yourself
a summoning spell.

26:57.718 --> 27:00.173
- Demon?
- God.

27:00.345 --> 27:03.714
Corey was so desperate for the truth
about her boyfriend's cheating heart...

27:03.890 --> 27:04.922
she went digging.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.935
Nothing panned out, so she went
looking for a different kind of help.

27:08.103 --> 27:10.511
Opened a door she couldn't close.

27:10.689 --> 27:14.687
And now anyone in town who asks
aloud for the truth, invokes Veritas.

27:14.860 --> 27:17.777
And she doesn't just give it to you,
she slams you with it...

27:17.946 --> 27:20.520
till you kill yourself,
and she gets her tribute.

27:20.699 --> 27:23.190
So all that tribute vanishing
from the morgue.

27:23.368 --> 27:25.527
<i>What do you think?
A Soylent Green situation?</i>

27:26.580 --> 27:28.738
A god's gotta eat too...

27:29.207 --> 27:32.707
which means we gotta take her out,
or you're on the menu.

27:32.878 --> 27:35.416
All right. What do we know?
Besides crazy cat lady.

27:35.589 --> 27:38.162
- Well, dogs are her Achilles heel.
- Naturally.

27:38.342 --> 27:40.714
She was a pretty hands-on
goddess back in the day.

27:40.886 --> 27:44.006
Her thing was coming down from the
mountain to speak truth to the masses.

27:44.181 --> 27:46.506
She wanted more than tribute,
she wanted to be worshiped.

27:46.683 --> 27:47.881
An attention whore.

27:49.311 --> 27:51.268
If you wanna put it that way.

27:51.438 --> 27:55.270
And what is the 21st-century version
of speaking truth to the masses?

28:01.323 --> 28:04.858
So you really think this god is slumming
as some farm-league Diane Sawyer?

28:05.035 --> 28:07.407
Yeah. Call it a hunch.

28:21.301 --> 28:23.210
<i>Ready to go? We're rolling.</i>

28:23.387 --> 28:25.426
<i>I'm Ashley-Ahem.</i>

28:25.597 --> 28:27.804
<i>Pick up. I'm Ashley Frank...</i>

28:27.975 --> 28:29.848
<i>bringing you Frank Talk.</i>

28:30.018 --> 28:31.678
<i>Do that again. Still rolling.</i>

28:31.853 --> 28:34.807
<i>I'm Ashley Frank,
bringing you Frank Talk.</i>

28:34.982 --> 28:36.262
<i>Again. Okay. One more.</i>

28:36.441 --> 28:37.852
<i>I'm Ashley Frank.</i>

28:38.026 --> 28:41.276
<i>Are organic fruits and veggies
really worth the cost?</i>

28:41.446 --> 28:44.198
She's creepy. I mean, the hair alone.

28:44.366 --> 28:46.323
I don't know.
Maybe there's nothing here.

28:48.036 --> 28:49.744
Maybe.

29:05.846 --> 29:08.088
<i>Action.
We'll ask the councilman ourselves</i>

29:10.726 --> 29:13.347
<i>- Are we still rolling?
- Hold on.</i>

29:13.520 --> 29:14.979
Check this out.

29:24.489 --> 29:26.482
Zoom in on that.

30:08.784 --> 30:11.275
Looks pretty normal, right?

30:11.453 --> 30:14.620
I'm sure inside it's chock full of creep.

30:22.589 --> 30:25.294
- Ready?
- Yeah. Ahem.

30:25.467 --> 30:27.376
- And that's-?
- Dog's blood.

30:27.552 --> 30:29.212
Do I wanna know where you got that?

30:30.305 --> 30:33.508
- Probably not.
- Yeah.

30:45.904 --> 30:46.983
Let's do this.

31:04.589 --> 31:06.712
So where's all the creep?

32:17.037 --> 32:18.412
You came for dinner.

32:36.974 --> 32:38.717
Sit tight.

32:39.351 --> 32:40.466
You're up next.

33:03.083 --> 33:06.748
The tongue is the tastiest part.

33:07.713 --> 33:10.417
It's where the lies roll off.

33:11.717 --> 33:12.879
Mm.

33:14.594 --> 33:15.923
Mm.

33:16.305 --> 33:18.974
I cannot wait to eat yours.

33:19.141 --> 33:22.225
I mean, I've seen liars before,
but you two?

33:23.395 --> 33:25.269
Gold standard.

33:28.150 --> 33:30.023
Point of professional pride.

33:30.444 --> 33:32.851
I wouldn't be so cocky
if I were you, Dean.

33:33.030 --> 33:36.149
You know what happens
when you base your life on lies, right?

33:36.700 --> 33:40.448
The truth comes along and...

33:43.457 --> 33:46.411
So while you've still got your tongue...

33:46.585 --> 33:49.539
God knows you've gotten an earful.

33:49.838 --> 33:53.503
I think it's your turn to spill some.

33:54.134 --> 33:58.381
How about we play a little
Truth or Truth?

33:59.973 --> 34:06.058
What should we ask Dean first, hmm?
Something personal about you?

34:08.315 --> 34:11.150
Hey, Dean, I'm curious.

34:11.318 --> 34:15.018
What do you really feel
about your brother?

34:21.119 --> 34:22.697
Better now.

34:22.871 --> 34:25.327
As of yesterday,
I wanted to kill him in his sleep.

34:28.918 --> 34:30.543
I thought he was a monster.

34:31.755 --> 34:33.463
But now I think-

34:34.757 --> 34:37.331
Now you think what?

34:37.511 --> 34:39.717
He's just acting like me.

34:40.263 --> 34:42.837
- What do you mean?
- It's the gig.

34:44.476 --> 34:46.801
You're covered in blood
till you're in your own blood.

34:46.978 --> 34:50.063
Half the time you're about to die.
Like right now.

34:51.692 --> 34:54.230
I told myself I wanted out...

34:55.070 --> 34:56.612
that I wanted a family.

34:56.780 --> 34:58.060
But you were lying.

34:58.699 --> 35:00.241
No.

35:01.159 --> 35:04.860
But what I'm good at
is slicing throats.

35:07.416 --> 35:08.696
I ain't a father.

35:10.669 --> 35:12.247
I'm a killer.

35:13.297 --> 35:16.796
And there's no changing that.
I know that now.

35:24.266 --> 35:29.972
So Sam walking back into your life
must have been a relief.

35:30.856 --> 35:31.887
Hmm?

35:32.190 --> 35:34.978
Mallory to your Mickey.

35:35.527 --> 35:39.572
And how do you feel about
the band getting back together?

35:40.741 --> 35:42.069
Sam?

35:51.501 --> 35:53.708
Look. Ahem.

35:54.713 --> 35:58.497
What we do is hard...

36:00.010 --> 36:03.343
but we watch out for each other.

36:05.724 --> 36:08.013
And that's what's important.

36:11.647 --> 36:14.647
And that's it. That's the truth.

36:15.943 --> 36:17.520
No.

36:18.654 --> 36:20.563
No, it's not.

36:22.199 --> 36:24.904
- You said yourself, I can't lie.
- How are you doing that?

36:25.202 --> 36:27.325
That's not possible.
You're lying to me.

36:27.496 --> 36:30.699
- No, I'm not.
- What are you? What is he?

36:32.125 --> 36:35.375
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Really? I doubt that.

36:35.545 --> 36:39.128
I doubt anything that comes
out of your mouth right now.

36:39.299 --> 36:41.458
You're not human.

36:42.219 --> 36:43.843
What?

36:45.597 --> 36:47.341
You didn't know that?

36:48.141 --> 36:49.339
Now, that I believe.

37:48.743 --> 37:50.023
Dean. It's me.

37:50.203 --> 37:51.863
You are not my brother.

37:52.288 --> 37:54.032
- Just listen-
- What are you?

37:54.207 --> 37:55.666
It's me, Dean.

37:55.833 --> 37:58.538
Look, please, just let me explain.

37:58.711 --> 38:02.246
- Why should I believe anything you say?
- You want the truth? Here it is.

38:02.423 --> 38:04.215
God's honest.

38:05.009 --> 38:08.425
She was right. There's something
wrong with me. Really wrong.

38:08.596 --> 38:09.925
I've known it for a while.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.550
I've lied to you. Yeah.

38:13.726 --> 38:16.513
And I let you get turned
by that vamp...

38:17.897 --> 38:19.475
because I knew there was a cure...

38:19.649 --> 38:22.650
and we need it in that nest,
and I knew you could handle it.

38:22.819 --> 38:27.030
Handle it? I could have died.
I could have killed Ben.

38:27.198 --> 38:28.776
That should stop me cold.

38:28.950 --> 38:31.951
But I-I just don't feel it.

38:32.745 --> 38:35.450
- You what?
- Ever since I came back.

38:35.623 --> 38:39.455
I am a better hunter
than I've ever been.

38:39.961 --> 38:43.661
Nothing scares me anymore
because I can't feel it.

38:45.341 --> 38:48.295
I don't know what's wrong with me.

38:51.306 --> 38:52.966
I think...

38:54.350 --> 38:55.465
I need help.
