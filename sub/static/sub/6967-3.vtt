01:38.231 --> 01:40.756
Hi, you've reached the Usher residence.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.358
Please leave a message at the tone.
Thank you.

01:43.470 --> 01:47.930
Hi, honey. It's about 8.30
and, um... I'm going to be here for a while.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.305
The presentation didn't go so well.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.469
Call me. I love you. Bye.

04:08.848 --> 04:11.817
Guess who I ran into
from our class at Quantico?

04:11.884 --> 04:15.081
- Marty Neil.
- J Edgar Jr?

04:15.188 --> 04:17.247
Just got bumped up.

04:17.322 --> 04:20.291
Foreign Counterintelligence,
New York City Bureau.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.452
Supervisory Special Agent.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.620
- Supervisory?
- That's right.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.291
Two years out of the Academy.
How did he land that?

04:27.400 --> 04:29.732
Lucked into the World Trade Center bombing.

04:30.403 --> 04:31.893
Well, good for Marty.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.304
Oh, come on, Dana! The guy is a loser.
Look where he is now.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.342
It's where we should be.

04:37.443 --> 04:41.106
Brad Wilson told me
the psychological profile you wrote

04:41.214 --> 04:45.241
on the Washington Crossing killer
led them straight to the suspect.

04:45.318 --> 04:49.277
Word has it you're on
the Violent Crimes Section's fast track.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.913
So, how are you doing?

04:51.024 --> 04:55.154
Have you had any close encounters
of the third kind?

04:56.963 --> 04:59.431
Is that what everyone thinks I do?

04:59.499 --> 05:03.833
No, of course not.
But you do work with Spooky Mulder.

05:03.903 --> 05:08.465
Mulder's ideas may be a bit out there,
but he is a great agent.

05:08.541 --> 05:11.476
Yeah, well, I've got this case that's out there.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.940
Baltimore PD calls.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.107
They want our help on a serial killer profile.

05:17.183 --> 05:21.279
Three murders. Began six weeks ago.
Victims vary in age, race, gender.

05:21.354 --> 05:24.380
- No known connections.
- I take it there's a pattern?

05:24.490 --> 05:26.788
Point of entry. Actually, the lack of one.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.360
What do you mean?

05:28.461 --> 05:31.157
One victim, college girl,
killed in her dorm room.

05:31.264 --> 05:35.200
She was found with the windows locked
and the door chained from the inside.

05:35.301 --> 05:40.136
The last incident, two days ago.
High-security office building.

05:40.206 --> 05:43.972
Nothing on the security monitors.
Janitor spoke to the victim minutes before.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.705
Didn't hear or see a thing out of the ordinary.

05:46.779 --> 05:47.871
Suicides?

05:54.120 --> 05:57.214
Each victim was found
with their liver ripped out.

05:58.991 --> 06:01.585
- No cutting tool was used.
- Bare hands?

06:03.529 --> 06:06.794
- This looks like an X-File.
- Let's not get carried away.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.163
I'm gonna solve these murders, but

06:09.235 --> 06:12.136
I would like you
to go over the case histories.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.106
Maybe come down to the crime scene.

06:15.174 --> 06:17.369
Do you want me to ask Mulder?

06:17.443 --> 06:21.140
OK. If he wants to come
and do you a favor, great!

06:21.214 --> 06:24.012
But make sure he knows this is my case.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.348
Dana, if I can break a case like this one,

06:27.987 --> 06:29.955
I'll be getting my bump up the ladder.

06:30.823 --> 06:31.551
And you...

06:33.559 --> 06:35.857
Maybe you won't have to be
Mrs Spooky any more.

06:39.165 --> 06:43.363
- So why didn't they ask me?
- They're friends from the Academy.

06:43.436 --> 06:46.633
I'm sure they just felt
more comfortable talking to me.

06:46.773 --> 06:52.268
- Why would I make them so uncomfortable?
- It probably has to do with your reputation.

06:52.378 --> 06:55.370
Reputation? I have a reputation?

06:55.448 --> 07:00.852
Colton plays by the book and you don't.
They feel your methods, your theories are...

07:00.953 --> 07:02.147
Spooky?

07:04.090 --> 07:07.582
- Do you think I'm spooky?
- Agent Scully's in here, sir.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.592
Dana!

07:09.662 --> 07:11.357
Sorry I'm late.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.296
We just got here.

07:13.399 --> 07:16.197
Fox Mulder. Tom Colton.

07:18.171 --> 07:21.629
So, Mulder, what do you think? Does this
look like the work of little green men?

07:21.707 --> 07:23.607
- Gray.
- Excuse me?

07:23.676 --> 07:24.665
Gray.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.235
You said green men.
A Reticulan skin tone is actually gray.

07:28.314 --> 07:32.375
They're notorious for their extraction
of terrestrial human livers,

07:32.452 --> 07:35.182
due to iron depletion
in the Reticulan galaxy.

07:35.254 --> 07:36.619
You can't be serious!

07:36.689 --> 07:40.125
Do you have any idea what
liver and onions go for on Reticula?

07:40.226 --> 07:41.693
Excuse me.

07:46.732 --> 07:50.190
Dana, I've been thinking about this
and I have a theory.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.863
It might explain a lot.
Tell me what you think.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.237
What if the guy enters the building...

08:09.822 --> 08:12.484
Hold on a second.
What in the hell is he doing?

08:16.762 --> 08:19.458
That vent is 6 inches by about 18.

08:20.066 --> 08:24.162
Even if a Reticulan could crawl through,
it's screwed in place.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.575
This is the print I took from Usher's office.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.443
These others are from an X-File.

08:37.517 --> 08:41.283
Ten murders, Baltimore area,
undetermined points of entry.

08:41.354 --> 08:46.587
Each victim had their liver removed. These
prints were found at 5 of the 10 crime scenes.

08:46.692 --> 08:51.652
- Ten murders. Colton never mentioned...
- Most likely he's unaware of them.

08:51.731 --> 08:56.668
These two prints were lifted five years
before he was born at Powhattan Mill.

08:56.736 --> 09:02.675
And these three were lifted probably
five years before his mother was even born.

09:02.808 --> 09:06.608
Are you saying these prints
are from the 1960s and the 1930s?

09:06.712 --> 09:12.480
Fingerprinting was just starting in 1903, but
there was a murder with an extracted liver.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.814
Of course.

09:13.920 --> 09:19.153
Now, that's five murders every 30 years.
That makes two more to go this year.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.318
You're saying these are copycats?

09:21.394 --> 09:23.885
What did we learn our first day
at the Academy?

09:23.996 --> 09:27.432
Each fingerprint is unique.
These are a perfect match.

09:27.533 --> 09:30.934
Are you suggesting I go before
the Violent Crimes Section

09:31.037 --> 09:34.905
and present a profile saying
these murders are done by aliens?

09:35.007 --> 09:37.498
No! I find no evidence of alien involvement.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.910
What, then? This is the work
of a 100-year-old serial killer

09:41.013 --> 09:43.811
who overpowered
a six-foot-two businessman?

09:43.916 --> 09:46.544
He'll stick out in a crowd
with ten-inch fingers!

09:47.320 --> 09:49.618
Look, bottom line.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.781
This is Colton's case.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.951
Our X-File dates back to 1903. We had it first.

09:55.928 --> 10:00.865
Mulder, they don't want you involved.
They don't want to hear your theories.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.333
That's why Blevins
has you hidden away down here.

10:03.402 --> 10:04.835
You're down here, too.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.063
Look, why don't we agree to this?

10:07.173 --> 10:11.371
They have their investigation, we have ours.
And never the twain shall meet.

10:13.145 --> 10:14.612
Agreed?

10:19.552 --> 10:24.546
After a careful review of the violent
and powerful nature of these murders,

10:24.624 --> 10:30.859
I believe the killer to be a male, 25-35 years
of age, with above average intelligence.

10:32.031 --> 10:35.194
His manner of entry
has so far been undetectable.

10:35.267 --> 10:40.967
This may be due to his knowledge of the inner
structure of buildings and duct works.

10:41.040 --> 10:47.001
Or that he in fact hides in plain sight
posing as delivery or maintenance workers.

10:59.025 --> 11:03.655
The extraction of the liver
is the most signifiicant detail of these crimes.

11:03.729 --> 11:08.928
The liver possesses regenerative qualities.
It cleanses the blood.

11:09.635 --> 11:13.628
The taking of this trophy
is the transferring act for the killer to

11:13.706 --> 11:16.300
cleanse himself of his own impurities.

11:16.409 --> 11:22.279
I think he is acting under the classic form
of obsessive-compulsive behavior.

11:22.915 --> 11:27.113
Since the victims are unrelated
and we cannot predict who will be next,

11:27.253 --> 11:31.451
we must use the fact that a killer
won't always succeed in finding a victim.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.424
When this occurs

11:33.492 --> 11:37.292
a serial killer may return to
the site of a previous murder,

11:37.363 --> 11:40.423
hoping to recapture the emotional high.

11:41.767 --> 11:45.567
I think our best course of action
is to target these sites.

11:46.739 --> 11:47.763
Good job, Agent Scully.

11:47.873 --> 11:52.469
If there are no objections, we'll begin
our stakeouts of the murder sites tonight.

11:52.545 --> 11:56.743
We're looking for a male, 25-35,
possibly wearing a uniform.

11:56.849 --> 12:01.309
Gas company, UPS, whatever. I know
you're assigned to another area, Scully,

12:01.387 --> 12:04.720
but you're welcome
to come aboard with us on this.

12:04.790 --> 12:09.090
That is if you don't mind working in an area
that's a bit more down to earth.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.910
Position ten. Station check.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.073
Position ten, I copy.

12:58.744 --> 13:01.110
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man,
would you, copper?

13:01.180 --> 13:04.343
- Mulder, what are you doing here?
- He's not coming back.

13:04.416 --> 13:08.648
His thrill comes from the challenge
of a seemingly impossible entry.

13:08.754 --> 13:12.053
If you'd read the X-File,
you'd come to the same conclusion.

13:12.158 --> 13:15.616
- Mulder, you are jeopardizing my stakeout.
- Seeds?

13:16.061 --> 13:18.154
You're wasting your time.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.198
I'm going home!

13:53.165 --> 13:56.066
Scully! Call for backup and get over here!

13:58.470 --> 14:00.870
Position ten requesting backup!

14:06.812 --> 14:08.370
In there.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.514
Federal Agent!

14:19.391 --> 14:21.291
I'm armed!

14:22.461 --> 14:25.453
Proceed down the vent. Slowly!

14:34.640 --> 14:37.131
Cover down to the corner!

14:37.243 --> 14:38.835
She's not by her car!

14:46.552 --> 14:48.952
- Take him!
- Move! Move! Move!

14:49.054 --> 14:53.013
FBI. Don't move! Don't move!
Get your hands up! Keep 'em up!

14:53.292 --> 14:56.887
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent...

14:56.962 --> 14:59.021
You were right.

15:00.165 --> 15:02.690
You have a right to have
an attorney present during questioning.

15:02.768 --> 15:05.931
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.876
Is your full name Eugene Victor Tooms?

15:13.178 --> 15:14.577
Yes.

15:15.147 --> 15:18.446
Are you a resident of the state of Maryland?

15:19.718 --> 15:21.151
Yes.

15:22.121 --> 15:26.581
Are you an employee
of the Baltimore Municipal Animal Control?

15:27.660 --> 15:29.093
Yes.

15:29.728 --> 15:33.687
Is it your intent to lie to me
about anything here today?

15:35.200 --> 15:36.360
No.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.803
Were you ever enrolled in college?

15:41.473 --> 15:42.872
Yes.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.276
Were you ever enrolled in medical school?

15:47.680 --> 15:48.908
No.

15:49.315 --> 15:52.341
Have you ever removed a liver
from a human being?

15:54.186 --> 15:55.585
No.

15:55.688 --> 15:58.816
Have you ever killed a living creature?

16:02.027 --> 16:03.756
Yes.

16:03.829 --> 16:07.026
Have you ever killed a human being?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.831
No.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.495
Were you ever in George Usher's office?

16:14.707 --> 16:16.004
No.

16:16.575 --> 16:18.941
Did you kill George Usher?

16:20.379 --> 16:21.937
No.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.348
Are you over 100 years old?

16:25.417 --> 16:28.443
- That must be a control question.
- I had her ask it.

16:29.421 --> 16:30.945
No.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.523
Have you ever been to Powhattan Mill?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.125
Yes.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.788
In 1933?

16:42.735 --> 16:44.566
No.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.839
Are you afraid you might fail this test?

16:50.142 --> 16:51.871
Well...

16:53.145 --> 16:57.479
Yes. Because I didn't do anything.

16:58.617 --> 17:00.244
He nailed it... A+.

17:00.352 --> 17:04.378
As far as I'm concerned,
the subject did not kill those two people.

17:09.194 --> 17:13.460
Maintenance at the office building
confirmed the call to Animal Control

17:13.565 --> 17:18.229
about a bad smell. They found a dead cat
in the second floor ventilation ducts.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.602
Still doesn't explain why he was there
that late at night.

17:21.707 --> 17:25.040
He's a civil servant with initiative
and we busted him for it.

17:25.109 --> 17:29.103
He was crawling up an air duct,
by himself, without alerting security.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.875
Dana, he passed the test.

17:30.983 --> 17:35.386
His story checks out. He's not the guy.
It doesn't mean your profile's incorrect.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.820
Scully's right. It is the guy.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.853
What have you got, Mulder?

17:40.926 --> 17:43.087
He lied on questions 11 and 13.

17:43.195 --> 17:47.097
His electrodermal and cardiographic
response nearly go off the chart.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.497
Is number 11 the 100-year-old question?

17:52.337 --> 17:57.206
Well, I had a reaction to that stupid question.
And what is this Powhattan Mill thing?

17:57.276 --> 18:02.680
Two murders with matching MOs occurred
in Powhattan Mill in 1933. Look at the chart.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.442
My interpretation of those reactions...

18:04.516 --> 18:08.816
I don't need you or that machine
telling me if Tooms was alive in '33!

18:09.455 --> 18:10.888
He's the guy.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.618
I'm letting him go.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.420
You coming?

18:19.665 --> 18:23.567
Tom, I want to thank you for letting me
put in some time with the VCS.

18:23.669 --> 18:28.299
- But I am officially assigned to the X-Files.
- I'll see what I can do about that.

18:28.373 --> 18:30.637
Tom, I can look out for myself.

18:30.709 --> 18:32.836
You said Mulder was out there.

18:33.145 --> 18:35.238
That guy's insane.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.950
You knew they wouldn't believe you.
Why did you push it?

18:46.058 --> 18:48.754
Maybe I thought you caught the right guy.

18:49.928 --> 18:52.761
And maybe I run into so many people
who are hostile

18:52.898 --> 18:56.334
because they can't open their minds
to the possibilities

18:56.401 --> 18:59.461
that sometimes
the need to mess with their heads

18:59.538 --> 19:02.803
outweighs the millstone of humiliation.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.409
It seems like you were acting very territorial.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.673
- I don't know...
- Of course I was.

19:08.747 --> 19:12.148
In our investigations,
you may not always agree with me,

19:12.217 --> 19:14.708
but at least you respect the journey.

19:14.786 --> 19:19.780
And if you want to continue working
with them, I won't hold it against you.

19:23.562 --> 19:28.522
I don't know. You must have something more
than your polygraph interpretation

19:28.600 --> 19:32.696
to back up this bizarre theory
and I have to see what it is.

19:35.741 --> 19:38.938
These are Eugene Tooms's prints.

19:45.584 --> 19:48.109
This is the fingerprint
they took from Usher's office.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.849
It matches the old ones from the X-Files.

19:50.989 --> 19:52.650
Obviously no match.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.049
What if

19:55.160 --> 19:57.219
somehow...

20:11.343 --> 20:12.935
How could that be?

20:13.045 --> 20:16.845
The only thing I know for certain is...
they let him go.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.741
64 inches from the south wall.

23:30.809 --> 23:34.142
Let's check on liver transplants
in the next 24 hours.

23:34.212 --> 23:37.739
- Maybe this is black market.
- Come on! It was ripped outta there.

23:37.816 --> 23:41.582
Look, at this point I'm willing
to give any theory a shot!

23:41.653 --> 23:46.955
Any sane theory. Dana, I only want qualified
members of the team at the crime scene.

23:47.025 --> 23:50.859
What's the matter?
You worried I'm going to solve your case?

23:50.962 --> 23:55.399
Tom, we have authorized access
to this crime scene.

23:56.301 --> 24:01.432
A report of you obstructing another officer's
investigation might stick out on your file.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.238
Look, Dana, whose side are you on?

24:08.380 --> 24:09.608
The victim's.

24:15.654 --> 24:18.122
105 inches from the fireplace.

24:23.995 --> 24:26.793
The victim is a Thomas Werner,
single, white...

24:26.865 --> 24:28.230
It's Tooms.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.694
And he took something.

24:48.019 --> 24:51.750
Baltimore PD checked out
Tooms's apartment. It was a cover.

24:51.857 --> 24:56.419
No one has ever lived there and he hasn't
shown up for work since the arrest.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.258
I found him.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.231
How do we learn about the present?
We look to the past.

25:01.299 --> 25:05.292
I think this is where it all began
in 1903, on Exeter Street.

25:05.437 --> 25:08.304
Look at the address
of that first murder in 1903.

25:10.742 --> 25:13.540
Apartment 203.

25:14.579 --> 25:16.672
He killed the guy above him.

25:16.748 --> 25:18.909
Maybe his neighbor
played the Victrola too loud.

25:18.984 --> 25:22.750
- This must be Tooms's great-grandfather.
- What about the prints?

25:22.854 --> 25:24.845
Genetics might explain the patterns.

25:24.923 --> 25:28.484
It also might explain
the sociopathic attitudes and behaviors.

25:28.560 --> 25:33.395
It begins with one family member who raises
an offspring who raises the next child...

25:33.532 --> 25:35.523
What is this? The Anti-Waltons?

25:36.268 --> 25:37.257
What do you think?

25:37.335 --> 25:41.669
I think we have to track Eugene Tooms.
There's four down and one to go this year.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.937
If we don't get him right now,
the next chance will be in...

25:45.010 --> 25:46.068
2023.

25:46.144 --> 25:49.773
You'll be head of the Bureau by then.
You go through the census.

25:49.881 --> 25:54.944
I'll plough through this century's
marriage, birth, death certificates and...

25:55.020 --> 25:58.717
Do you have any Dramamine on you?
These things make me seasick.

26:28.853 --> 26:30.946
- Anything?
- Nope.

26:31.022 --> 26:34.355
He disappeared off the face of the earth. You?

26:34.993 --> 26:38.451
Never was born. Never married. Never died.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.792
At least in Baltimore County.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.859
Oh, I did find one thing, though.

26:44.336 --> 26:49.467
It's the current address of the investigating
officer of the Powhattan Mill murders in 1933.

26:51.376 --> 26:54.641
I've been waiting 25 years for you.

26:54.746 --> 26:56.543
Sir?

26:56.648 --> 27:00.084
I called it quits in 1968

27:00.185 --> 27:03.154
after 45 years as a cop.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.448
And those killings at Powhattan Mill...

27:09.094 --> 27:12.655
I was a sheriff then
and I'd seen my share of murders.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.024
Bloody ones.

27:16.668 --> 27:18.966
But I could go home and...

27:20.271 --> 27:24.401
pitch a few baseballs to my kid
and never give it a second thought.

27:24.476 --> 27:29.277
You gotta be able to do that.
You... you'd go crazy, right?

27:31.082 --> 27:33.573
But those murders in Powhattan Mill...

27:35.520 --> 27:39.889
When I walked into that room,
my heart went cold.

27:41.192 --> 27:44.286
My hands... numbed.

27:46.131 --> 27:48.224
I could feel...

27:49.234 --> 27:50.701
it!

27:50.802 --> 27:52.861
Feel what, Frank?

27:55.640 --> 28:00.407
When I first heard about
the death camps in 1945,

28:01.046 --> 28:03.241
I remembered Powhattan Mill.

28:04.315 --> 28:07.284
When I see the Kurds and the Bosnians,

28:08.253 --> 28:10.881
that room is there, I tell you.

28:12.023 --> 28:15.925
It's like all the horrible acts
that humans are capable of

28:16.027 --> 28:20.123
somehow gave birth to some kind of...

28:20.665 --> 28:23.759
human monster.

28:26.137 --> 28:28.901
That's why I say I've been waiting for you.

28:32.977 --> 28:35.775
There's a box in the trunk here.
Get it for me, would you, please?

28:44.522 --> 28:47.958
Now, this is all the evidence I've collected.

28:48.393 --> 28:52.329
- Officially and unofficially.
- Unofficially?

28:52.397 --> 28:58.563
I knew that the murders in '63
were by the same... person as in '33.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.464
But by then they had me
on a desk pushing papers

29:02.540 --> 29:05.566
and they wouldn't let me
anywhere near the case.

29:05.677 --> 29:08.271
- A piece of the removed liver?
- Yes.

29:08.346 --> 29:12.305
But, you know, that's not
the only trophy he took with him.

29:12.383 --> 29:18.015
Family members reported small
personal effects missing in each case.

29:18.123 --> 29:22.389
A hairbrush in the Walters murder.
A coffee mug in the Taylor murder.

29:23.928 --> 29:27.329
Have you ever heard
the name Eugene Victor Tooms?

29:28.399 --> 29:33.200
When they wouldn't bring me aboard in '63,
I... I did some of my own work.

29:33.304 --> 29:35.499
I took these surveillance pictures.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.970
This

29:38.042 --> 29:40.533
is Tooms.

29:43.114 --> 29:46.106
Of course, that was him 30 years ago.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.448
And this...

29:50.855 --> 29:53.119
is the apartment where he lived.

29:53.992 --> 29:56.790
- It was located at...
- 66 Exeter Street?

29:56.928 --> 29:58.623
Right.

29:58.730 --> 30:01.255
That's it. Right there.

30:33.298 --> 30:35.391
Here's 103.

30:48.379 --> 30:50.438
The old man was right.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.608
You can feel it.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.792
There's nothing here.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.469
Check this out.

31:17.909 --> 31:20.036
What's down here?

31:23.648 --> 31:25.707
I don't know.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.646
Let's find out.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.908
Just an old coal cellar.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.992
Somebody having a garage sale?

32:23.207 --> 32:28.804
- This is the shape on Werner's mantel.
- Frank said he collected trophies.

32:32.717 --> 32:37.154
- Does he live in here?
- It looks like the wall's deteriorating.

32:37.221 --> 32:39.689
No. Somebody made it.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.756
This is a nest.

32:47.832 --> 32:49.197
Look.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.825
It's made out of rags and newspapers.

32:51.936 --> 32:56.373
This looks like the opening.
Think there's anything inside?

32:56.774 --> 32:59.436
Oh, my God, Mulder. It smells like...

33:01.212 --> 33:03.339
I think it's bile.

33:04.615 --> 33:09.314
Is there any way I can get it off my fingers
quickly without betraying my cool exterior?

33:11.456 --> 33:14.550
- No one could live in this.
- I don't think it's where he lives.

33:15.526 --> 33:17.118
I think it's where he hibernates.

33:18.563 --> 33:20.622
- Hibernates?
- Just listen.

33:21.833 --> 33:26.634
What if some genetic mutation
could allow a man to awaken every 30 years?

33:26.738 --> 33:28.330
Mulder...

33:28.406 --> 33:32.968
And what if the five livers could provide him
sustenance for that period?

33:33.044 --> 33:38.209
What if Tooms is some kind of
20th century... genetic mutant?

33:39.083 --> 33:43.144
In any case, he's not here now
and he's gotta come back.

33:43.254 --> 33:47.156
- We'll need a surveillance team.
- That'll take some finagling.

33:47.258 --> 33:51.354
You go downtown and see what
you can finagle and I'll keep watch.

34:03.608 --> 34:06.076
Oh, wait. I'm snagged on something.

34:07.278 --> 34:10.179
Oh, it's OK. I got it.

34:31.601 --> 34:33.728
It's about time.

34:33.838 --> 34:36.306
So... who we looking for again?

34:36.407 --> 34:39.534
Eugene Tooms. He's unarmed
but consider him dangerous.

34:39.643 --> 34:44.547
Scully and I will be back to relieve you
in eight hours if he doesn't show. Right here.

34:44.649 --> 34:46.810
You got it... Spooky.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.482
We have to talk.

34:55.359 --> 34:57.259
- I have to meet Mulder.
- That's why we have to talk.

34:57.361 --> 35:01.320
You're using two of my men
to sit in front of a condemned building!

35:01.432 --> 35:04.333
It isn't interfering with your investigation.

35:04.435 --> 35:08.496
When we had lunch, I looked forward
to working with you. You were a good agent.

35:08.573 --> 35:11.508
But, after Mulder,
I couldn't have you far enough away.

35:11.576 --> 35:14.272
Don't go down there.
I had the stakeout called off.

35:14.378 --> 35:15.675
You can't do that!

35:15.746 --> 35:20.274
No, I can't! But my Regional ASA did it
once I told him about the waste in man-hours.

35:20.384 --> 35:24.047
Uh-uh. Let me call Mulder.
Let me tell him the news.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.547
Is this what it takes
to climb the ladder, Colton?

35:27.925 --> 35:29.552
All the way to the top.

35:30.161 --> 35:33.927
Then I can't wait till you fall off
and land on your ass.

35:41.405 --> 35:44.101
This is Fox Mulder.
I'm not here. Leave a message.

36:13.437 --> 36:15.530
Where is everyone?

36:15.606 --> 36:17.164
Scully?

36:28.019 --> 36:31.352
This is Fox Mulder.
I'm not here. Leave a message.

36:31.455 --> 36:35.186
Mulder, you must have gone out
since Colton gave us the night off.

36:35.259 --> 36:39.389
What say we file a complaint against him?
I am furious!

36:40.865 --> 36:44.631
Call me when you get in. OK, bye.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.864
Dammit!

37:49.667 --> 37:51.225
Dammit, answer!

38:38.716 --> 38:40.183
Scully!

39:00.538 --> 39:02.301
Are you all right?

39:09.780 --> 39:12.510
He's not gonna get his quota this year.

40:24.188 --> 40:27.589
Look at him. He's building another nest.

40:27.658 --> 40:31.754
You'll be interested to know
that I've ordered some genetic tests.

40:31.862 --> 40:37.027
The preliminary medical exam
revealed quite abnormal development

40:37.101 --> 40:39.399
in the muscular and skeletal systems.

40:39.470 --> 40:42.633
As well as a continually
declining metabolic rate.

40:42.706 --> 40:46.802
It dips way below the levels
registered in deep sleep.

40:47.678 --> 40:49.441
Did you hear me, Mulder?

40:49.513 --> 40:53.108
All these people putting bars
on their windows.

40:53.217 --> 40:58.052
Spending good money on hi-tech
security systems trying to feel safe.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.249
I look at this guy and I think...

41:02.026 --> 41:04.085
it ain't enough.
