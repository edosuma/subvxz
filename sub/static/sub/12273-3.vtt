00:01.135 --> 00:03.204
*

00:03.237 --> 00:05.239
(people shouting, gasping)

00:06.407 --> 00:09.143
* Take me to the home,
kick boots *

00:09.177 --> 00:10.644
(chimes jingling)

00:10.678 --> 00:14.115
* See heaven flash
a horror show *

00:14.148 --> 00:16.117
* Knock it nice and smooth

00:16.149 --> 00:18.252
(grunts)

00:19.553 --> 00:22.490
(horn honking,
trolley bell dinging)

00:22.523 --> 00:26.760
* Never gonna stop me,
never gonna stop *

00:26.794 --> 00:29.197
* Never gonna stop me

00:29.230 --> 00:30.631
* Never gonna stop

00:30.664 --> 00:33.667
* Never gonna stop me,
never gonna stop *

00:33.701 --> 00:35.769
(grunts)

00:35.803 --> 00:38.639
* A dinosaur,
he paint the monster red

00:38.672 --> 00:42.676
* So the blood don't stain
the floor... *

00:42.710 --> 00:46.114
(horns honking)

00:46.147 --> 00:47.681
(grunts)

00:47.715 --> 00:49.583
Damn! Take it easy, cop!

00:49.617 --> 00:51.152
Why you so agro?

00:51.185 --> 00:53.787
Sorry, I'm not
from around here.

01:20.214 --> 01:24.452
* Out here in the fields

01:24.485 --> 01:27.355
* I fight for my meals

01:27.388 --> 01:33.093
* I get my back into my living

01:35.463 --> 01:37.565
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.886
(camera shutter clicking)

02:04.958 --> 02:07.795
No wallet, and I found
a tag on his backpack.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.298
Ran the name through NYSPIN,
got a hit to his address.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.432
His name's Ethan Grohl,

02:11.465 --> 02:13.301
19 years old,

02:13.334 --> 02:15.169
lives on the Brooklyn side.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.770
Requested bridge
surveillance footage.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.939
Might get us a glimpse
of the killer.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.209
Who found him?
Passing biker.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.243
HAWKES:
Cause of death,

02:22.276 --> 02:23.944
exsanguination,

02:23.977 --> 02:26.214
result of a deep abdominal
stab wound.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.481
Asymmetrical tissue damage

02:27.515 --> 02:30.251
suggests a serrated blade.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.352
Looks like he took

02:31.385 --> 02:32.686
a pretty stiff shot
to the nose as well.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.788
HAWKES:
Yeah.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.824
Could've left him unconscious
long enough for bleed out.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.226
FLACK: Well,
from the look of things,

02:38.259 --> 02:39.693
I'm guessing
that didn't take too long.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.862
Also,

02:41.895 --> 02:43.364
seeing some contusions

02:43.397 --> 02:45.399
across his right knuckles.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.967
FLACK: There was definitely
a struggle.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.237
HAWKES: But did Ethan
know his attacker

02:49.270 --> 02:51.805
or was it a stranger?

02:51.839 --> 02:53.707
Mac?

03:02.916 --> 03:04.718
You think these are fake?

03:04.752 --> 03:06.354
It's too early to tell.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.622
FLACK:
Well, if they're real,

03:08.656 --> 03:10.291
what the hell
was this guy doing

03:10.324 --> 03:12.260
with pictures of a dead girl
in his backpack?

03:12.293 --> 03:14.762
Maybe his death has something
to do with hers.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.298
Either way,
it looks like one homicide

03:17.331 --> 03:19.567
may have just become two.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.543
(giggling)

03:30.511 --> 03:31.479
Oh.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.816
God, I thought we'd never
get through dinner.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.618
You didn't enjoy me

03:37.651 --> 03:38.952
rattling on about my work?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.888
Of course I did.

03:42.790 --> 03:46.260
I just couldn't stop
thinking about dessert.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.995
(moaning)

03:50.598 --> 03:52.433
Wait. Wait.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.767
What?
Did you hear that?

03:53.801 --> 03:54.902
All I can hear

03:54.935 --> 03:56.304
is my heart beating. What?

03:56.337 --> 03:57.871
No, I'm serious.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.573
I think there's someone

03:59.607 --> 04:01.575
in the apartment.

04:19.959 --> 04:20.761
NYPD.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.596
Show me your hands.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.332
ELLIE:
Oh, my God.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.065
Mom,

04:25.098 --> 04:26.400
it's me.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.801
Hey, Mrs. Danville.
I thought you said

04:27.835 --> 04:29.002
she was gonna be at a party?

04:29.036 --> 04:30.871
I thought you were
at a party, Ellie.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.606
Hello? It's at Sammy's house,

04:32.640 --> 04:34.608
three floors down.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.076
We just came up to
get some more soda.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.011
I see that. Who's we?

04:38.045 --> 04:40.047
(sighs)
Jordan, Mom.

04:40.080 --> 04:40.948
Mom,

04:40.981 --> 04:42.282
Jordan.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.819
I'd introduce you
to the surfer dude

04:45.853 --> 04:47.555
with the hairy chest,

04:47.588 --> 04:49.390
but I have no idea who he is.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.404
TAYLOR:
Hey, Sid, what do you got?

05:03.437 --> 05:04.905
Oh, Mac.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.474
Are you familiar with the words

05:06.507 --> 05:08.509
of Heraclitus of Ephesus?

05:08.542 --> 05:10.511
I'm not sure I
got that memo.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.112
Well, he was an ancient
Greek philosopher

05:12.145 --> 05:14.081
who once said, "The eyes

05:14.114 --> 05:16.517
are more accurate witnesses
than the ears."

05:16.550 --> 05:17.818
And in the case
of Ethan Grohl here,

05:17.851 --> 05:21.489
he may actually
have been right.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.024
This is a disposable

05:24.057 --> 05:26.394
contact lens.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.095
I found it tangled
in Mr. Grohl's hair.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.730
So naturally,

05:29.763 --> 05:31.632
I went looking for its match.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.067
And that's when I saw--

05:34.101 --> 05:36.704
take a look-- these.

05:36.737 --> 05:40.441
Look at the screen.

05:40.474 --> 05:43.043
Some kind of surgical scarring?

05:43.076 --> 05:46.647
Radial keretotomy, to be exact.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.516
It's been largely supplanted
by Lasik,

05:48.549 --> 05:50.884
but it is still used
for the treatment

05:50.918 --> 05:52.119
of astigmatism,

05:52.152 --> 05:54.388
and these scars
are relatively recent.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.890
Means Ethan would've likely had

05:56.924 --> 05:58.759
no need for
contact lenses.
Right.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.561
And this one could
actually belong

06:00.594 --> 06:01.695
to our killer.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.597
(grunting)

06:05.999 --> 06:07.401
Good eye, Sid.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.641
*

06:22.450 --> 06:25.886
* Oh, I beg you

06:25.919 --> 06:27.888
* Can I follow?

06:29.757 --> 06:32.860
* Oh, I ask you

06:33.727 --> 06:36.029
* Why not always?

06:37.498 --> 06:41.769
* Be the ocean

06:41.802 --> 06:45.005
* Where unravel

06:45.038 --> 06:48.509
* Be my only

06:49.910 --> 06:53.481
* Be the water and waiting

06:53.514 --> 06:56.917
* You're my river
running high *

06:56.950 --> 07:01.121
* Run deep, run wild

07:01.154 --> 07:03.056
* I, I follow

07:03.090 --> 07:07.194
* I follow you deep sea, baby

07:07.227 --> 07:10.931
* I follow you,
I, I follow *

07:10.964 --> 07:12.900
* I follow you

07:12.933 --> 07:16.770
* Dark boom honey,
I follow you *

07:16.804 --> 07:20.240
* Run deep, run wild

07:20.273 --> 07:22.843
* I, I follow

07:22.876 --> 07:26.947
* I follow you deep sea, baby

07:26.980 --> 07:31.184
* I follow you,
I, I follow *

07:31.218 --> 07:32.786
* I follow you

07:32.820 --> 07:36.824
* Dark boom honey,
I follow you. *

07:41.261 --> 07:43.230
WOMAN:
Oh, my God,

07:43.263 --> 07:46.066
that's Mary.

07:46.099 --> 07:49.503
I'm sorry,
Mr. and Mrs. Portico,

07:49.537 --> 07:51.539
but your address
was on the envelope

07:51.572 --> 07:53.641
containing these photos.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.775
MR. PORTICO:
Is she...

07:54.808 --> 07:58.178
Are you telling us
that Mary is dead?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.213
Based on what we've seen,

08:00.247 --> 08:02.916
I'm afraid it's a possibility.

08:02.950 --> 08:06.286
(over intercom):
Who did that to her?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.722
We've just begun
our investigation.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.563
Why would someone send
those photos to her parents?

08:15.596 --> 08:17.064
It clearly wasn't for ransom.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.298
For some reason,

08:18.331 --> 08:21.101
they wanted the Porticos to
know their daughter was dead.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.670
TAYLOR: I understand
from the missing persons report

08:22.703 --> 08:25.906
that you had an argument
with Mary a couple of weeks ago?

08:25.939 --> 08:27.040
Yes,

08:27.074 --> 08:30.110
but we told the officers
it was just the usual, you know?

08:30.143 --> 08:31.579
Help with the dishes.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.679
Pick up your dirty clothes.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.549
Stop spending
so much time online.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.719
We all went to bed mad,

08:38.751 --> 08:40.688
and when we woke up
the next morning,

08:40.721 --> 08:43.023
she... she was gone.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.960
She's only 15.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.598
TAYLOR:
Were there any girls
that Mary was

08:50.631 --> 08:52.866
particularly close to?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.234
Boys? Anyone who

08:54.267 --> 08:55.836
might have been a confidant?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.004
MRS. PORTICO:
She's shy.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.138
She doesn't have

08:58.171 --> 08:59.873
a lot of close friends.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.009
What about enemies?
No.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.277
She just wanted to fit in.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.850
Do you recognize
this young man?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.652
His name is Ethan Grohl.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.287
No.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.758
I never heard her
mention him, either.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.160
You think he had something
to do with this?

09:20.193 --> 09:21.662
TAYLOR:
We're looking into it.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.996
I checked Ethan's Grohl's place.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.198
There was no signs
of a struggle or murder.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.300
What about unidentified DOA's?
I searched

09:27.334 --> 09:29.703
the rolls for New York
and surrounding states.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.371
No one matched her description.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.840
TAYLOR:
Mary didn't have

09:32.873 --> 09:34.808
a cell phone?
She did.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.844
She lost it.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.379
I told her the next one
was gonna be on her dime.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.714
God, why didn't I

09:40.748 --> 09:42.082
just get her
a new one?

09:42.115 --> 09:44.652
Well, she did have an ATM card.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.120
We got it for Mary
for her 14th birthday.

09:47.154 --> 09:50.323
We thought that it would
teach her responsibility.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.359
Why, have you found something?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.928
The bank records pulled

09:54.962 --> 09:56.930
by missing persons
indicate that Mary

09:56.964 --> 09:59.332
withdrew all $700
from her account

09:59.366 --> 10:00.901
the day she
went missing.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.671
But that's all the money she'd
saved up from babysitting.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.706
Are you suggesting
that she ran away?

10:05.739 --> 10:08.942
That she had a plan,
she wanted to get away from us?

10:08.976 --> 10:11.211
I'm not suggesting anything,
Mr. Portico,

10:11.244 --> 10:13.213
but sadly, what was

10:13.246 --> 10:16.049
being handled as a runaway
missing persons case

10:16.083 --> 10:17.718
is now being investigated

10:17.751 --> 10:20.688
as a homicide
missing persons case.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.289
MR. PORTICO:
I want to know

10:22.322 --> 10:24.224
what happened to my
daughter, Detective,

10:24.257 --> 10:26.226
and I want the person...

10:26.259 --> 10:30.363
(crying): who took her
away from us to pay.

10:30.397 --> 10:33.300
You have my word they will.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.970
(sobbing)

10:40.273 --> 10:43.276
There's no tougher job
in the world.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.112
Being a cop?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.948
Being a parent.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.018
*

10:53.286 --> 10:55.723
(footsteps approaching)

10:55.756 --> 10:57.124
LINDSAY:
Hey.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.392
What do you think
about our daughter

10:59.426 --> 11:01.428
wearing body armor
when she becomes

11:01.461 --> 11:03.430
a teenager?
After looking
at these photos,

11:03.463 --> 11:04.965
I'm fine with that.

11:04.998 --> 11:05.966
Oh, good.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.234
So, did you solve the case?

11:07.267 --> 11:09.269
Me? I thought
you had the answer.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.872
No, the partial footprint
was not a match

11:11.905 --> 11:13.974
to Ethan Grohl, so it could
have been from our killer,

11:14.007 --> 11:15.475
but it could have been
from anybody,

11:15.508 --> 11:18.311
and I ID'd those tiny
orange flecks as dried paint,

11:18.345 --> 11:20.080
but I can't get
a match in EDNA.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.782
Messer family--
0 for two.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.783
SID:
You rang?

11:22.816 --> 11:24.151
Sid,

11:24.184 --> 11:26.053
please, thank you
for coming up.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.354
Oh, don't be silly.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.256
I spend all day
in a refrigerated room

11:29.289 --> 11:30.423
with no cell reception.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.993
I live
for these invitations.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.063
All right, well, in that case,
uh, this is our photo-topsy.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.064
(chuckles)

11:37.097 --> 11:38.231
Take a look at
these snapshots,

11:38.265 --> 11:41.735
tell me if you could, uh,
determine a cause of death.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.107
Oh, well, at a cursory glance
I'm seeing multiple contusions

11:47.140 --> 11:49.843
around the
supraorbital process

11:49.877 --> 11:52.179
as well as the bridge
and septum of the nose.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.382
Uh, there's fresh blood pooling,

11:55.415 --> 11:58.451
approximately 18 to 20
inches in diameter,

11:58.485 --> 12:02.455
originating from the nose,
mouth, and open abrasions

12:02.489 --> 12:03.791
of the scalp.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.325
If I had
to hazard a guess,

12:05.358 --> 12:08.428
I'd say your C.O.D. could be
cerebral hemorrhage

12:08.461 --> 12:10.330
due to blunt-force trauma.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.465
I mean, right?
So, just

12:12.499 --> 12:14.802
to play devil's advocate,
do you think that there's

12:14.835 --> 12:17.104
any chance that these wounds
aren't legit?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.507
No.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.210
I once caught my own daughter

12:23.243 --> 12:24.845
faking a bloody nose
with food coloring

12:24.878 --> 12:26.213
to get out
of a spelling test.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.116
I know chicanery
when I see it.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.885
However, there is something here

12:31.919 --> 12:33.453
that does beg
questioning.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.554
Is that
a track mark?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.123
(Danny sighs)

12:36.156 --> 12:39.159
That's amazing-- I mean,
15 years old and she's using.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.495
Unfortunately I can't run
a tox panel on a photograph,

12:42.529 --> 12:45.265
so confirming that
is impossible.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.399
I'm afraid
I'm not much help.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.801
No, thanks, Sid.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.903
Maybe her watch
could tell us something.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.371
It's a pretty clear view
of the face.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.307
Maybe we can use it
to time-stamp the photos.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.009
Let's see, this
one says 4:30:58.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.980
DANNY:
This is 4:31 here.

13:00.013 --> 13:04.117
SID: And... 4:30:56
on this photo.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.854
Okay, so that
photo's first.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.856
Second.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.357
Third.

13:10.390 --> 13:14.427
With a total of four seconds
elapsed from beginning to end.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.897
Uh, there's just
one problem.

13:16.930 --> 13:17.998
What?

13:18.031 --> 13:19.399
Condensation.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.534
Why is the glass face
on her watch

13:21.568 --> 13:25.105
in this last
photo fogged?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.074
Because it's so close
to her mouth.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.375
She's breathing.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.476
Right, so she might have

13:29.509 --> 13:30.677
not been beaten
to death after all.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.846
I think you were premature in
calling the medical examiner.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.547
When this final photo
was taken,

13:34.581 --> 13:36.884
Mary Portico
was still

13:36.917 --> 13:39.019
very much alive.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.133
Ellie, put
the phone down.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.568
You know I don't allow 'em
at the table.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.541
You're not hungry?

14:01.574 --> 14:03.210
I had nachos at school.

14:03.243 --> 14:06.880
I told you I was coming home
to make dinner.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.516
And we need to talk.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.952
I don't want to talk.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.520
Why not?
Because it's just

14:13.553 --> 14:16.256
going to be one of those talks
where you do all the talking.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.357
No, it's not.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.525
You go first.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.294
Go ahead,
ask me anything you want.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.131
(sighs)

14:24.164 --> 14:25.365
What's his name?

14:25.398 --> 14:27.234
Cade.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.969
Okay, great.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.637
Sit.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.105
He's an
FBI agent.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.573
He's visiting
from California.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.643
He and I used to work together
at the Bureau.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.445
Looks like you were doing
a little bit more than that.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.479
Yes,

14:39.512 --> 14:41.481
because I thought
you were spending the night

14:41.514 --> 14:42.582
at Sammy's after the party,

14:42.615 --> 14:44.384
but instead
I find you

14:44.417 --> 14:46.987
in the kitchen
with what's-his-name.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.522
I told you, it's Jordan.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.925
He's a ninth grader,
a basketball player.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.393
It's no big deal.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.262
No big deal?

14:55.295 --> 14:57.998
Oh, my God, Ellie,
I could have killed both of you.

14:58.031 --> 15:01.701
Listen to me, this is
about your safety,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.370
so I don't care
if it's Jordan

15:03.403 --> 15:06.073
or Drake or all the members
of One Direction.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.007
You may not bring

15:07.040 --> 15:09.409
anyone into this apartment
when I'm not here

15:09.442 --> 15:10.944
without my permission,

15:10.978 --> 15:13.947
especially when I don't
even know who he is.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.349
Don't give me
that look.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.385
I am the adult,
you're the child.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.586
I'm not a child.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.155
Okay, you're a teenager.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.690
We still have rules
in this family.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.159
Yeah, and yours are different
than mine-- I get it.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.194
Good.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.361
(utensils clatter)

15:28.395 --> 15:30.397
Let's eat.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.104
Ellie, was that your first kiss?

15:37.137 --> 15:39.206
Are you kidding me right now?

15:39.239 --> 15:42.175
I can't believe
you're not talking to me

15:42.209 --> 15:43.610
about these things.

15:43.643 --> 15:47.147
Because, Mom, I knew you'd do
exactly what you're doing.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.748
What, caring?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.183
No, prying.

15:50.217 --> 15:54.654
(sighing)

15:54.687 --> 15:56.723
Ellie, come on.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.126
I just want to know
how you feel.

15:59.159 --> 16:02.462
Well, I don't know yet, okay?

16:02.495 --> 16:04.497
Do you?

16:08.501 --> 16:10.737
(sighs)
You want some green beans?

16:10.770 --> 16:13.040
No, I have homework.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.651
*

16:45.272 --> 16:48.108
HAWKES:
Ethan Grohl
might have had drugs

16:48.141 --> 16:49.642
on him when
he was attacked--

16:49.676 --> 16:53.113
heroin to be exact, cut with
traces of cocaine, LSD, and B12.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.547
B12?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.516
I guess even users need
their vitamins.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.784
I found this

16:57.817 --> 17:02.089
street pipe, foil burner
in his backpack.

17:02.122 --> 17:05.224
Bridge surveillance shows

17:05.258 --> 17:06.292
the killer was lying in wait,

17:06.326 --> 17:08.494
but at that hour I think
he was waiting for anyone.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.628
Ethan just happened
to come along

17:09.662 --> 17:11.664
at the wrong time.
When the killer

17:11.698 --> 17:14.233
couldn't score any cash,
he took the only valuable thing

17:14.267 --> 17:15.367
he could find.
The heroin,

17:15.402 --> 17:16.469
but he didn't even touch

17:16.502 --> 17:18.471
that envelope
full of photos.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.339
Means he probably didn't know
anything about Mary Portico.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.076
But Ethan certainly did.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.729
* Come on

17:56.576 --> 17:59.246
*

17:59.279 --> 18:01.348
* There is no way around it.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.253
FLACK:
Boyd Hackman--

18:06.286 --> 18:09.322
our number one suspect
in Ethan Grohl's murder.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.523
Already done
a couple stints upstate

18:10.557 --> 18:12.592
for assault
and armed robbery.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.526
Holy sideburns.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.596
Not even a mother
could love that face.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.132
Where is he?
In the wind
with a parole warrant.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.468
Hasn't checked in or been
at his place in over 24 hours.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.502
I got unis sitting
on it now.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.338
In the meantime I ran
Ethan Grohl's phone records

18:25.372 --> 18:27.807
and noticed dozens of calls
to and from a 212 number

18:27.840 --> 18:29.509
within 36 hours of his death.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.610
Thought it might mean
something.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.479
Tracked that number

18:32.512 --> 18:35.215
to a guy named Oliver Epps,
and I'm trying to get a bead

18:35.248 --> 18:36.349
on where he is now.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.484
Did you run Epps' name

18:37.517 --> 18:38.718
by Mary Portico's parents?

18:38.751 --> 18:39.719
Next on my list

18:39.752 --> 18:41.754
of things to do.
Okay.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.656
Looks like you've got
your hands full as well.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.894
Hmm, you could say that.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.396
(chuckles)

18:49.429 --> 18:50.830
Detective Danville.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.699
Agent Conover,
thank you for coming.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.301
No problem.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.269
I just wish we could have had
this meeting at my hotel

18:56.303 --> 18:57.770
because we have
these margaritas--

18:57.804 --> 18:59.772
the best I've ever had--
at the bar.
I need FBI support

18:59.806 --> 19:01.308
to find Mary Portico,

19:01.341 --> 19:03.510
a minor who went
missing two weeks ago.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.511
We thought we were
investigating her death,

19:04.544 --> 19:06.713
but it turns out there
could be a slim chance

19:06.746 --> 19:09.249
she's still alive and
in imminent danger.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.351
Oh, so if she's dead
she's your case,

19:11.384 --> 19:12.352
and if she's alive
she's mine?

19:12.385 --> 19:13.486
Well, this one's tricky,

19:13.520 --> 19:14.787
but your specialty
in the Bureau

19:14.821 --> 19:17.657
is tracking missing persons
across state lines,

19:17.690 --> 19:18.658
and I realize
you're on vacation,

19:18.691 --> 19:19.792
but this is a teenage kid.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.395
Cleaned out her bank account,
she could be anywhere.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.664
We need to broaden the
scope of our search,

19:24.697 --> 19:26.533
so I really need your help.
Hmm.

19:28.268 --> 19:31.170
Everything you need
to know is right here.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.574
You love taking advantage
of me, don't you?

19:34.607 --> 19:36.376
You have no idea.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.289
I feel like my eyes are going
to pop out of my skull.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.723
Come on, babe,
stay with me.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.959
We got to figure out where
these photos were taken.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.827
So no details

19:54.861 --> 19:56.596
from the
hardwood floor.

19:56.629 --> 19:57.997
The lamp is
mass-produced.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.699
You checked the
paper in the corner?

19:59.732 --> 20:03.703
Yeah, it's a take-out
menu, but there's no name.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.605
Yeah, but there is, uh,

20:05.638 --> 20:08.375
a partial address
on it from...

20:08.408 --> 20:09.709
Right, Ulton Street,

20:09.742 --> 20:11.578
which is probably Fulton Street,
but there's hundreds

20:11.611 --> 20:13.613
of restaurants
down there, and so far

20:13.646 --> 20:16.983
none of them match that
flower pattern in any way.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.287
All right, let's take another
look at the beer bottle, okay?

20:21.488 --> 20:23.756
All right, so based on
its proximity to the body,

20:23.790 --> 20:25.592
it was probably broken
in the struggle.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.960
I couldn't make out a label.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.363
Wait a second-- boom,
right there, you see that?

20:30.397 --> 20:32.732
What?
Right there, that piece
of glass in the center.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.502
Looks like there's some kind
of reflection in it.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.903
Yeah, maybe
from a window.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.471
The sun is visible.

20:38.505 --> 20:41.608
We know it's around 4:30,
so we're looking at a sunset

20:41.641 --> 20:42.842
in the west.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.345
It's backlighting something.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.615
Is that just me

20:48.648 --> 20:50.617
or does that look like
the Flatiron Building?

20:50.650 --> 20:53.252
No, that's not just you, babe.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.993
Okay, the
Flatiron Building

21:01.027 --> 21:02.695
is 22 stories,

21:02.729 --> 21:04.597
so the crime scene had
to be across the street,

21:04.631 --> 21:05.898
below the 20th floor,

21:05.932 --> 21:08.034
with a direct view
of the Flatiron's front wedge.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.669
(typing)
All right?

21:15.575 --> 21:17.544
(knocking on door)

21:19.479 --> 21:21.448
Good afternoon, sir.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.082
I'm Detective Lovato
with the NYPD.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.984
We're searching
for a missing young girl.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.420
You mind if I take a look
inside your apartment?

21:30.890 --> 21:33.726
Good afternoon, sir, I am
Detective Messer with the NYPD.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.562
We're searching for
a missing young girl.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.465
LINDSAY:
We're searching
for a missing young girl.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.567
You mind if I take a look
inside your apartment?

21:40.600 --> 21:44.471
Good afternoon, I'm
Detective Lovato with NYPD.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.407
Do you mind if I take a look
inside your apartment?

21:50.109 --> 21:51.878
I'm Detective Messer
with the NYPD.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.946
Do you mind if I take a
look in your apartment?

21:53.980 --> 21:56.416
(baby crying)
Hello.
NYPD.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.052
Te despertaste mi bebé.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.822
Disculpáme, señora, lo siento.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.962
Call me crazy,
but I'm not seeing those
hardwood floors, Lindsay.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.431
Neither am I.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.565
Windows don't match, either.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.434
And I don't see how that view

22:14.467 --> 22:17.570
could've been reflected into
any of these apartments.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.677
And they canvassed
multiple floors?

22:24.711 --> 22:26.713
Every viable vantage point
of the Flatiron,

22:26.746 --> 22:28.748
from the one angle it
could have been seen from,

22:28.781 --> 22:31.751
but nothing lined up with the
Mary Portico crime scene photos.

22:31.784 --> 22:32.852
It doesn't make sense.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.687
All of our science
says she was there.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.656
You hear anything
more from Flack?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.591
Still no 20 on Oliver Epps.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.727
He's the guy who traded all
the calls with Ethan Grohl?

22:40.760 --> 22:41.694
Right.

22:41.728 --> 22:45.131
But apparently,
Mary's parents knew his name.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.166
Oliver, I guess,
was an older kid

22:47.199 --> 22:49.001
who went to school
with Mary in Manhattan.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.504
She had a big crush on him, and
he dropped out about a year ago.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.672
Mm.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.040
So we don't know where he is,

22:54.073 --> 22:55.475
but he's definitely
the connection

22:55.508 --> 22:56.876
between Ethan and Mary.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.578
Epps have family of his own?

22:58.611 --> 23:00.713
Flack's trying to
track them down.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.882
But I did notice
something interesting.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.685
The 212 number assigned to
Oliver's cell may be local,

23:05.718 --> 23:08.621
but the cell towers
getting hit by its signal
definitely weren't.

23:08.655 --> 23:11.624
All the calls that
Oliver Epps made

23:11.658 --> 23:14.093
to Ethan Grohl originated
from the West Coast.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.569
Was it something I said?

23:22.602 --> 23:24.737
Get Agent Conover
and meet me in the War Room.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.476
The fog on Mary Portico's
wristwatch

23:29.509 --> 23:31.010
could very well be
her last breath.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.645
But our priority is still
to find her, right?

23:32.679 --> 23:33.646
TAYLOR:
Absolutely.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.982
We've just been looking
in the wrong place.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.818
Mary took out $700
from her ATM.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.019
We know she has a crush
on Oliver Epps.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.954
I think she used it
to go be with him.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.825
But Manhattan isn't the only
city with a Fulton Street...

23:45.858 --> 23:48.661
And we're not the only one
with a Flatiron Building.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.196
And the reason
Lindsay had trouble

23:50.229 --> 23:51.964
identifying the
orange paint flecks

23:51.998 --> 23:53.833
is because they're not
in EDNA's database.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.503
It's a proprietary color,

23:56.536 --> 23:59.205
developed in the 1930s,
called "International Orange."

23:59.238 --> 24:02.909
And you can only
find it in one place.

24:09.516 --> 24:10.817
Dead or alive,

24:10.850 --> 24:13.853
Mary Portico is somewhere
in San Francisco.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.263
DANVILLE:
Flack confirmed it.
This is Oliver Epps' apartment,

24:24.296 --> 24:26.766
right across from
the San Francisco Flatiron.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.550
All right, we spoke to
the building manager.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.884
The lease on this apartment's
being paid for by

24:44.917 --> 24:47.554
Oliver Epps' parents,
who live in Long Island.

24:47.587 --> 24:48.555
They claim they haven't seen him

24:48.588 --> 24:50.156
since he moved to San Francisco
over a year ago.

24:50.189 --> 24:52.191
And the manager says
the kid's hardly ever here.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.060
Is there any chance that
Oliver Epps is a victim

24:54.093 --> 24:55.261
in all this, as well?

24:55.294 --> 24:57.196
Well, based on the active
federal interstate drug warrant

24:57.229 --> 24:58.565
I pulled on him,

24:58.598 --> 25:00.867
I seriously doubt it.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.572
Well, this is definitely
where he took the photos.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.273
Looks to me like he cleaned up

25:07.306 --> 25:09.241
an awful lot of blood.
Enough to kill her?

25:09.275 --> 25:11.844
Well, it's hard to tell if
these are mop streaks

25:11.878 --> 25:13.312
from cleaning up,

25:13.345 --> 25:14.781
or drag marks,

25:14.814 --> 25:16.583
from removing Mary's body.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.017
This handwriting definitely

25:18.050 --> 25:19.786
looks like a match
to the envelope we found

25:19.819 --> 25:21.187
at Ethan Grohl's crime scene.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.190
At the very least,
Oliver Epps could be good for

25:24.223 --> 25:26.893
assault, kidnapping,
unlawful imprisonment.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.028
You got the full support of
the FBI on this one, Mac.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.096
Epps is a very
dangerous young man.

25:30.129 --> 25:33.900
Well, I'm here to find
a vulnerable young woman.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.276
27 to two.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.278
Doesn't matter.
How does that not matter?

25:46.312 --> 25:48.748
We're talking about
27 World Series wins.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.016
That is over two dozen times

25:50.049 --> 25:53.152
the Yankees have been rightfully
anointed the gods of baseball,

25:53.185 --> 25:55.087
whereas the Mets...
The Mets are the heart.

25:55.121 --> 25:58.324
The heart and soul of
New York City baseball.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.927
Come on.
Tom Seaver.
Voted into the Hall of Fame

26:00.960 --> 26:03.162
with the highest first ballot
percentage in history.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.631
Rusty Staub.

26:04.664 --> 26:07.333
Founded the New York Police
and Fire Widows Fund.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.235
And don't even get me
started on Gary Carter.

26:09.268 --> 26:12.304
Again: 27 to two.

26:12.338 --> 26:16.008
And 19 of those were before
the Mets even existed.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.645
(laughs)
How are you such a pinstriper?

26:18.678 --> 26:20.880
Did you not say you were
born and raised in Queens?

26:20.913 --> 26:23.783
Proudly. But fortunately,
my father had the good sense

26:23.816 --> 26:26.753
never to let me root for
a sad-sack bunch of boo...

26:26.786 --> 26:28.187
That's Boyd Hackman.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.922
Boyd Hackman! NYPD!

26:31.357 --> 26:33.660
BOYD:
Go, go, go!
Out of the way! Go! Go!

26:33.693 --> 26:35.928
(tires screeching)

26:35.962 --> 26:36.763
(grunts)

26:39.666 --> 26:41.668
(Boyd grunts)

26:41.701 --> 26:43.202
Ow.

26:43.235 --> 26:46.005
LOVATO:
Don't move.
Ow. Ow! (groans)

26:48.107 --> 26:50.376
(sighs)
I'm sorry...
Ow.

26:50.409 --> 26:51.844
what were you saying?

26:54.914 --> 26:56.683
You keep that crazy bitch
away from me.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.284
Watch your tongue or I'll
leave you alone with her.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.286
I think she hurt my neck.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.754
We think you
killed Ethan Grohl.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.690
I don't even know
any Ethan Grohl.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.892
No? You should. Here.

27:05.925 --> 27:08.828
Maybe this will
refresh your memory.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.831
This is you mugging Ethan Grohl
on the Brooklyn Bridge

27:11.864 --> 27:13.299
just before you killed him.

27:13.332 --> 27:16.035
You can't tell that's me.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.237
No, y can't tell
that's you. Of course,

27:18.270 --> 27:20.339
you can't see much without
your contacts, can you, Boyd?

27:20.372 --> 27:22.208
Huh?

27:22.241 --> 27:23.810
How many fingers?

27:27.346 --> 27:29.248
Turns out you lost one
of your lenses on our victim.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.350
Then we found a hunting
knife in your jacket.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.953
Oh, and the bundle of heroin
we found in your apartment

27:33.986 --> 27:35.221
that you stole
from his backpack.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.255
(scoffs)

27:36.288 --> 27:38.390
Okay, it was his fault!

27:38.424 --> 27:40.059
His fault?

27:40.092 --> 27:43.763
Yeah! What kind of kid
doesn't carry a wallet?

27:47.767 --> 27:49.268
Real charmer that one.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.270
Probably a Mets fan.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.072
Ooh.
Do you want me to give you

27:53.105 --> 27:55.107
a head start like him
before I kick your ass?

27:55.141 --> 27:56.809
Or would you like
to take your chances?

28:04.751 --> 28:07.920
*

28:29.508 --> 28:30.777
You ever run away from home?

28:30.810 --> 28:32.244
No. You?

28:32.278 --> 28:34.080
Few times. Yeah.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.848
I even, uh...

28:35.882 --> 28:38.517
I even ran away to be
with this girl once. Yeah.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.353
Uh, except she, um...
she only lived across town,

28:41.387 --> 28:43.823
and, uh, these two other
guys showed up. Yeah.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.058
Ugh. It was crowded.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.293
But I would've never

28:47.326 --> 28:49.395
gone all the way across the
country like Mary did, though.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.931
I mean, my home life
might've sucked, but...

28:51.964 --> 28:54.133
it's the evil
you know, you know?

28:54.166 --> 28:57.203
But at her age, I'm sure
Mary would've come home
by now if she could.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.805
(computer beeping)

28:58.838 --> 29:00.840
Oliver Epps' prints are all over

29:00.873 --> 29:02.975
this heroin bundle.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.777
I-I still can't figure
out what this...

29:04.811 --> 29:06.445
daisy sticker is, though.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.450
CADE:
It's called "Flower Power."

29:11.483 --> 29:14.020
It's high-grade heroin
distributed by a...

29:14.053 --> 29:16.388
drug ring here
in San Francisco.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.589
Listen to this,

29:17.623 --> 29:21.327
according to intel I just got
from our local task force,

29:21.360 --> 29:22.895
Epps is part of it.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.363
Makes sense.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.365
The heroin's an
exact chemical match

29:26.398 --> 29:28.267
to the street pipe
residue we found

29:28.300 --> 29:30.102
in Ethan Grohl's bag.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.571
So what if Oliver sent the
drugs to Ethan in exchange

29:32.604 --> 29:35.207
for delivering the photos
to Mary Portico's parents?

29:35.241 --> 29:37.844
What could he hope to gain
with her already dead?

29:37.877 --> 29:39.812
Maybe the gains
were Mary's.

29:40.847 --> 29:42.314
You think she was in on it?

29:42.348 --> 29:44.050
Well, we know she was
upset with her parents.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.317
She might've thought
sending the photos

29:45.351 --> 29:46.953
was a way to find
her freedom.

29:46.986 --> 29:50.222
Now, that sounds like
something a kid would do.
Well,

29:50.256 --> 29:53.125
if that was her plan, she picked
the wrong guy to hatch it with.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.127
What can you tell us about
Oliver Epps' involvement

29:55.161 --> 29:56.395
in the drug ring?

29:56.428 --> 29:58.430
Well, on the record,
I can tell you

29:58.464 --> 30:00.299
it's an ongoing investigation.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.101
And off the record?
(sighs)

30:02.134 --> 30:03.903
It's centered in Haight-Ashbury.

30:03.936 --> 30:06.105
There's a restaurant
in the neighborhood

30:06.138 --> 30:08.040
that my case agents suspect

30:08.074 --> 30:09.441
is being run
as a front.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.046
DANVILLE:
358 Fulton Street.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.148
The Daisy Chain Cafe.
This is the place.

30:20.052 --> 30:21.620
Ah.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.555
(Jamaican accent):
Welcome to the Daisy Chain.

30:23.589 --> 30:26.558
Can you tell us if you've
seen this young man?

30:26.592 --> 30:29.261
Uh... nah.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.332
You want a smoothie?

30:35.334 --> 30:37.303
CADE:
Right, you haven't seen him.
Let's go!

30:38.604 --> 30:40.439
Yeah, this is Agent Cade Conover

30:40.472 --> 30:42.474
with the FBI.
I need SFPD

30:42.508 --> 30:45.244
backup in the vicinity
of Fulton and Page.

30:45.277 --> 30:46.845
10-31 in progress.

30:48.547 --> 30:51.017
(panting)

30:52.318 --> 30:54.954
(people shouting, gasping)

30:54.987 --> 30:57.189
Step aside. Stop! Police!

30:58.224 --> 31:00.292
(grunts)

31:00.326 --> 31:02.561
(chimes jingling)

31:04.663 --> 31:06.632
Oh!

31:06.665 --> 31:08.034
(grunts)

31:08.067 --> 31:09.368
(crowd exclaims)
Hey!

31:09.401 --> 31:11.337
Stop!

31:11.370 --> 31:14.106
(trolley bell dinging)

31:18.377 --> 31:20.980
TAYLOR:
Jo. Just entered
the south end of the park.

31:21.013 --> 31:24.083
You and Cade circle around
to the north side.

31:24.116 --> 31:27.119
(panting)

31:36.695 --> 31:37.997
(grunts)

31:51.543 --> 31:53.679
(horns honking)

31:56.548 --> 31:58.684
(grunts)
Damn! Take it easy, cop!

31:58.717 --> 32:01.020
Why you so agro?
Sorry,

32:01.053 --> 32:02.721
I'm not from around here.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.256
I got him, I got him.
(grunts)

32:04.290 --> 32:05.691
Go ahead, check my pockets.
I got nothin'!

32:05.724 --> 32:07.526
We don't want your
drugs. Where is she?

32:07.559 --> 32:09.161
Who?
Mary.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.462
Tell me what you did to her!

32:10.496 --> 32:12.198
Nothing she didn't ask for.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.169
Maybe you didn't
understand the question.

32:17.203 --> 32:20.239
Where is Mary Portico?

32:20.272 --> 32:22.041
That little head case?

32:22.074 --> 32:23.609
Good luck finding her, man.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.111
She's gone.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.584
What do you mean Mary's gone?
Did you kill her?

32:32.618 --> 32:35.387
No, I didn't kill her.
She's just...

32:35.421 --> 32:38.190
you know, a little messed up.
I'm sure she's got you

32:38.224 --> 32:40.359
to thank for that.
Where is she?

32:40.392 --> 32:43.062
Don't you think if she
wanted to be found, she'd
be back in New York already?

32:43.095 --> 32:44.596
Her parents want her found,
Oliver.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.632
Did you ever stop
to think about that?

32:46.665 --> 32:47.933
Hell, yeah.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.469
Why do you think we sent
those photos to them
in the first place?

32:50.502 --> 32:52.071
It was Mary's idea.

32:52.104 --> 32:55.041
What do you want to do, again?
I'm just saying...

32:55.074 --> 32:57.343
I could, like, fake
like I'm dead,

32:57.376 --> 32:59.678
and you could take pictures
to send to my parents.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.480
Man, you must be really
pissed at them.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.715
Whatever.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.684
At least they won't
come looking for me.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.086
Damn, girl.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.121
That's Cray.

33:14.693 --> 33:18.597
But sure, what the hell,

33:18.630 --> 33:20.732
let's have some fun.

33:20.766 --> 33:24.103
No, wait, what are you doing?

33:24.136 --> 33:27.039
You shot up a 15-year-old
with heroin?

33:27.073 --> 33:29.675
I had to give her
something for the pain.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.485
What the hell is
wrong with you?
Look,

33:39.518 --> 33:40.519
I just did what she asked.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.254
And then what happened?

33:42.288 --> 33:43.255
Then she started bitching
and moaning,

33:43.289 --> 33:45.257
saying she wanted
to run back home to Mama.

33:45.291 --> 33:46.692
And I was like,
"Screw that," you know?

33:46.725 --> 33:48.227
I'm 19 years old.

33:48.260 --> 33:51.497
You're only 15, I'm not
getting hit with statutory.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.465
Oh, no, that's done.
It's done.

33:53.499 --> 33:54.566
(scoffs)

33:54.600 --> 33:56.502
I just wish we could
peg you for murder.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.073
I told you, she's still alive.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.741
She better be.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.343
Because your buddy Ethan isn't.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.079
What are you talking about?

34:07.113 --> 34:08.179
TAYLOR:
He's dead, Oliver.

34:08.214 --> 34:11.083
He got mugged on his way
across the Brooklyn Bridge,

34:11.117 --> 34:12.318
trying to deliver
those pictures

34:12.351 --> 34:13.851
to Mary's parents.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.621
Oh, dude...

34:15.654 --> 34:16.588
Sad, right?

34:16.621 --> 34:18.590
Didn't get to keep
the drugs you sent him.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.426
Of course, that's not
going to keep you

34:20.458 --> 34:22.628
from racking up interstate
trafficking charges.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.496
DANVILLE:
Believe me when I tell you,

34:25.531 --> 34:27.466
it's in your best
interest to help us.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.601
TAYLOR:
We're only going to
ask you one more time:

34:29.635 --> 34:31.737
Where is Mary Portico?

34:40.512 --> 34:42.514
(dog barking in distance)

34:48.254 --> 34:50.255
(man snoring softly)

35:02.368 --> 35:04.370
(groaning softly)

35:33.765 --> 35:36.402
Mary?

35:36.435 --> 35:38.937
Hey.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.739
Can you help me?

35:40.772 --> 35:41.940
That's why we're here.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.276
Your parents are very worried
about you.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.777
(sighs)

35:45.811 --> 35:47.646
I'm sorry.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.649
They were very mad at me, but...

35:50.682 --> 35:53.719
I should have listened to
them instead of trusting him.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.754
Is he here? If Oliver sees
me talking to you,

35:55.787 --> 35:57.323
he's going to be really mad.

35:57.356 --> 35:58.490
Now, don't worry.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.959
It's okay.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.261
He can't hurt you now.

36:02.294 --> 36:04.296
(sighs)

36:04.330 --> 36:05.897
Oh, that's good.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.705
I think I'm lost.

36:13.739 --> 36:17.376
No, sweetie, you've been found.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.929
FLACK:
You got to be kidding me.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.370
Welcome home, Yankee.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.672
I thought your desk
could use some sprucing up.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.984
The look on Mr. Portico's face
when he walked into Mary's

37:33.018 --> 37:35.921
hospital room, that's going to
stay with me for a long time.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.490
Feels nice to be able to

37:38.524 --> 37:40.992
deliver good news
every once in a while.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.962
Yeah.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.664
This one hit close
to home, didn't it?

37:45.697 --> 37:48.900
Well, I mean,
Ellie's a teenager,

37:48.934 --> 37:50.936
just like Mary and Lord knows

37:50.969 --> 37:53.839
we don't always see
eye to eye.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.574
But God, I would hate to think
one argument

37:55.607 --> 37:57.576
could change so much.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.747
Just got to keep the lines
of communication open and

38:01.780 --> 38:03.615
give yourself a
break every now

38:03.649 --> 38:04.783
and then while you're at it.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.552
You're a great mom, Jo.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.719
She's lucky to have you.

38:07.753 --> 38:08.954
Thanks, Mac.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.088
Would you mind telling her that?

38:10.121 --> 38:12.424
(both laugh)

38:12.458 --> 38:14.326
You go ahead
and laugh, you'll see.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.628
Just wait till you
and Christine start plopping out

38:16.662 --> 38:18.597
cute little blonde babies
into the world.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.832
Slow down, Jo.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.000
You don't fool me.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.503
I've seen you two.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.745
(sighs)

38:40.552 --> 38:44.890
Oh, where did you go,
little girl?

38:47.693 --> 38:50.562
(phone rings)

38:52.864 --> 38:54.566
Hey.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.601
Hey.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.936
Sorry we had to leave so soon.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.438
It's all right.

38:59.471 --> 39:00.606
You had to get Mary
on the first plane out.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.374
How's she doing?

39:02.408 --> 39:04.743
Oh, time will tell.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.478
How are you?

39:06.512 --> 39:08.880
Well, Ellie spent the night
with her friend Sammy

39:08.914 --> 39:10.916
again while we rushed
off to San Francisco.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.751
So who knows what kind
of trouble

39:12.784 --> 39:14.119
she's gotten herself into.

39:14.152 --> 39:17.523
Nothing you wouldn't have
gotten into, for sure.

39:17.556 --> 39:20.158
Yeah, that's exactly
what worries me.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.027
(laughs)

39:22.060 --> 39:25.030
Well, she's a good kid.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.032
Just like her mom.

39:28.934 --> 39:31.637
I wish you
could have stayed, Jo.

39:31.670 --> 39:34.473
Please.
All those

39:34.506 --> 39:35.441
blue skies and sun tans?

39:35.474 --> 39:37.643
Why would I want to
do a thing like that?

39:37.676 --> 39:39.177
You tell me.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.646
Maybe I will.

39:40.679 --> 39:42.914
One of these days.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.651
Okay.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.152
Bye.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.387
Bye.

40:05.971 --> 40:09.107
Let me see
your hand.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.943
You seriously think he's cute?

40:11.977 --> 40:13.645
Jordan? Yeah.

40:13.679 --> 40:16.081
He's pretty good looking
for a freshman.

40:16.114 --> 40:17.816
But you should
pace yourself.

40:17.849 --> 40:19.685
They do get better
with time.

40:19.718 --> 40:21.219
You mean like Cade?

40:21.252 --> 40:22.688
Ah...

40:22.721 --> 40:24.956
you did notice.

40:24.990 --> 40:28.460
No, 'cause that would be gross.

40:28.494 --> 40:30.195
(quiet laugh)

40:30.228 --> 40:32.097
But do you like him?

40:32.130 --> 40:34.232
Yeah, I think so.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.568
Complicated,
though, you know?

40:36.602 --> 40:38.570
He lives there
and we live here.

40:38.604 --> 40:40.706
We could move.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.542
That's sweet, Ellie.
You mean

40:43.575 --> 40:44.676
you'd do that for me?

40:44.710 --> 40:46.244
Sure, but you'd have to

40:46.277 --> 40:48.013
buy me all new clothes.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.716
We'll talk about it later.

40:50.749 --> 40:51.917
Do we have to?

40:51.950 --> 40:53.819
Nah.
