WEBVTT

00:00.327 --> 00:02.326
So, the final scores are in

00:02.327 --> 00:05.326
and I can reveal that
in second place with 70 points,

00:05.327 --> 00:06.327
I'm Smartacus!

00:06.328 --> 00:08.326
APPLAUSE

00:08.327 --> 00:10.166
So, in joint first place,

00:10.167 --> 00:12.326
with 75 points
and a chance to win the ham,

00:12.327 --> 00:17.166
we have a tie between Angela's Team
and We Own The Bloody Bar.

00:17.167 --> 00:19.006
Which can mean only one thing,
everybody,

00:19.007 --> 00:20.326
it's a sudden-death tiebreaker!

00:20.327 --> 00:21.366
ALL: <font color="#11FF11">Ooh!</font>

00:21.367 --> 00:23.326
It's a geography question.
Here goes.

00:23.327 --> 00:28.326
What is the capital of Britannia?

00:28.327 --> 00:30.326
We Own The Bloody Bar,
I'll take your answer first.

00:30.327 --> 00:32.326
<font color="#00FFFF">It's Londinium.</font>

00:32.327 --> 00:34.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Right, cos I think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it's Camulodunum.</font>

00:34.327 --> 00:36.326
<font color="#00FFFF">OK, well, I KNOW it's Londinium.</font>

00:36.327 --> 00:38.006
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, what do you two think?</font>

00:38.007 --> 00:40.326
<font color="#11FF11">I can only think about ham.</font>
I'm gonna have to hurry you.

00:40.327 --> 00:42.166
<font color="#00FFFF">OK, right, I think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we go with Marcus.</font>

00:42.167 --> 00:43.326
<font color="#00FFFF">It's the sort of saddo shit</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he knows.</font>

00:43.327 --> 00:45.326
<font color="#11FF11">Thank you. It is.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I am excellent at geography.</font>

00:45.327 --> 00:48.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Fine! Go on then, saddo.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Londinium. It's Londinium.</font>

00:48.327 --> 00:51.326
Angela's Team?
<font color="#00FFFF">We think it's Camulodunum.</font>

00:51.327 --> 00:54.326
And the capital of Britannia is...

00:54.327 --> 00:55.526
Camulodunum!

00:55.527 --> 00:58.326
Angela's Team, you've won the ham!

00:58.327 --> 01:00.326
Well played, well played. Whoa! Hey!

01:00.327 --> 01:03.367
<font color="#11FF11">I'm keeping it! Get off!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">We own the bloody bar! Argh!</font>

01:05.527 --> 01:08.166
# When in Rome

01:08.167 --> 01:09.327
# Do as the Romans do

01:12.687 --> 01:15.326
# Far from home

01:15.327 --> 01:18.327
# All I got is you. #

01:23.327 --> 01:26.326
Hello, Gloria.
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, you made it.</font>

01:26.327 --> 01:28.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Surprised you found your way</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">across town,</font>

01:28.327 --> 01:30.326
<font color="#FFFF00">what with your piss-poor</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">grasp of geography.</font>

01:30.327 --> 01:31.686
HE CHUCKLES
Still on that, are we?

01:31.687 --> 01:34.326
How about we move on? Try and find
our way to dinner later?

01:34.327 --> 01:36.006
<font color="#FFFF00">Hm. Can't, I'm afraid.</font>

01:36.007 --> 01:37.326
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm having a wild night in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with Barney</font>

01:37.327 --> 01:39.326
<font color="#FFFF00">and his essay on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the Second Punic War.</font>

01:39.327 --> 01:42.006
Is that not something
he can handle himself?

01:42.007 --> 01:44.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Handling himself is the only thing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he can do these days.</font>

01:44.327 --> 01:47.326
<font color="#FFFF00">He's in some stinky, sticky phase,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">where all he thinks about is sex.</font>

01:47.327 --> 01:49.846
Not sure that's a phase, exactly.

01:49.847 --> 01:52.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Forgot his schoolbooks, too,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the dozy sod.</font>

01:52.327 --> 01:54.326
<font color="#FFFF00">I'd get in a pedagogue</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to tutor him if I had the cash.</font>

01:54.327 --> 01:57.326
<font color="#FFFF00">I know even less about this stuff</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">than him. </font>Why don't I tutor him?

01:57.327 --> 01:59.846
<font color="#FFFF00">I guess because last night proved</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you know even less than me?</font>

01:59.847 --> 02:01.686
No, that was different.
That was geography.

02:01.687 --> 02:04.326
This is history.
AKA my specialist subject.

02:04.327 --> 02:06.326
Especially the Punic Wars.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.326
And extra-specially, the second one.

02:08.327 --> 02:12.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, that would be very helpful,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">actually.</font>

02:12.327 --> 02:15.326
<font color="#FFFF00">You don't expect me to pay for this,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">do you? </font>Nah, course not.

02:15.327 --> 02:17.326
Not in... money, anyway.

02:17.327 --> 02:19.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh! It's really not a phase, is it?</font>
Afraid not.

02:19.327 --> 02:22.326
I'll make sure he gets his
schoolbooks as well. <font color="#FFFF00">Yeah? You sure?</font>

02:22.327 --> 02:23.687
All part of the service, madam.

02:26.327 --> 02:30.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Hang on, Gloria wants you to be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a paedo for her son? </font><font color="#FFFF00">Pedagogue!</font>

02:30.327 --> 02:32.366
<font color="#FFFF00">Not paedo. As in tutor.</font>

02:32.367 --> 02:34.326
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm a pedo, if anything.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Right.</font>

02:34.327 --> 02:36.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Sorry, language was never</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">my specialist subject.</font>

02:36.327 --> 02:38.326
<font color="#11FF11">No shit! Do you even have one?</font>

02:38.327 --> 02:39.327
<font color="#00FFFF">Er, yes!</font>

02:39.328 --> 02:41.326
<font color="#00FFFF">It was, er... not maths.</font>

02:41.327 --> 02:43.326
<font color="#00FFFF">All right, what's yours,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">dick breath?</font>

02:43.327 --> 02:45.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Apart from being bullied?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Well, where do I start?</font>

02:45.327 --> 02:47.366
<font color="#11FF11">Woodland dance. Calligraphy.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Choral odes.</font>

02:47.367 --> 02:49.526
<font color="#00FFFF">Choral odes?!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Big time, baby.</font>

02:49.527 --> 02:53.006
<font color="#11FF11">You're looking at the primo soprano</font>
<font color="#11FF11">at my school's soprano choir.</font>

02:53.007 --> 02:55.326
Soprano? Isn't that a girl's part?
<font color="#11FF11">Traditionally, yes.</font>

02:55.327 --> 02:58.366
<font color="#11FF11">But thankfully, my balls remained</font>
<font color="#11FF11">high and hard until I was 18.</font>

02:58.367 --> 03:00.326
<font color="#00FFFF">So you were bullied, then?</font>

03:00.327 --> 03:02.326
<font color="#11FF11">Well, yes, obviously a bit.</font>

03:02.327 --> 03:05.326
<font color="#11FF11">Mainly by the girl</font>
<font color="#11FF11">whose solos I'd stolen.</font>

03:05.327 --> 03:07.326
<font color="#00FFFF">What about you, G-Dog?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">What was your specialist subject?</font>

03:07.327 --> 03:09.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Uh... probably lunch.</font>

03:09.327 --> 03:11.326
Not a subject.
<font color="#FFFF00">Course it is.</font>

03:11.327 --> 03:14.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Every meal is a test</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I have a 100% pass rate.</font>

03:14.327 --> 03:16.326
Yeah, well, not any more, you don't.

03:16.327 --> 03:18.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Hey, what you doing?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I were acing that.</font>

03:18.327 --> 03:20.326
Go take Barney his school books.

03:20.327 --> 03:21.327
There is no such thing
as a free lunch.

03:21.328 --> 03:23.846
<font color="#FFFF00">Mm, alright, keep your dick on.</font>

03:23.847 --> 03:26.326
<font color="#00FFFF">I must have a specialist subject.</font>

03:26.327 --> 03:27.327
<font color="#00FFFF">Maybe it's fashion.</font>

03:27.328 --> 03:31.847
<font color="#11FF11"># Don't think it is, mate. #</font>

03:42.367 --> 03:45.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Barney!</font>

03:45.327 --> 03:46.846
<font color="#FFFF00">Excuse me.</font>

03:46.847 --> 03:48.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Has anyone seen Barney?</font>

03:48.327 --> 03:50.326
Hey, you,
what are you doing out there?

03:50.327 --> 03:52.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, soz.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm just looking for Barney.</font>

03:52.327 --> 03:53.366
Are you a sixth former?

03:53.367 --> 03:55.366
<font color="#FFFF00">What? No.</font>

03:55.367 --> 03:58.326
Then you're not allowed
outside the gates at breaktime.

03:58.327 --> 03:59.327
Come on, in you come.

03:59.327 --> 04:00.327
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, uh...</font>

04:00.328 --> 04:02.326
Have you had your lunch yet?

04:02.327 --> 04:04.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Uh... not completely.</font>

04:04.327 --> 04:05.327
They stop serving in 20 minutes,

04:05.328 --> 04:08.326
so if you want something to eat,
you better hurry up. <font color="#FFFF00">Right.</font>

04:08.327 --> 04:09.846
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

04:09.847 --> 04:11.326
<font color="#FFFF00">I better had, hadn't I?</font>

04:11.327 --> 04:12.687
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes.</font>

04:15.007 --> 04:17.327
Come on, chop chop.
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh, yeah.</font>

04:24.007 --> 04:28.326
By what means did Rome achieve
victory in the Second Punic War?

04:28.327 --> 04:30.686
So, the thing to do here
is break the question down.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.326
What does 'by' mean?

04:32.327 --> 04:34.326
What does 'means' mean?

04:34.327 --> 04:35.686
What does 'Rome' mean?

04:35.687 --> 04:37.326
<font color="#FFFF00">The city we live in?</font>

04:37.327 --> 04:39.326
No, I know. Sure.

04:39.327 --> 04:40.846
But what does 'victory' mean?

04:40.847 --> 04:42.326
Was it a victory, in fact?

04:42.327 --> 04:44.526
Isn't that the question
behind the question?

04:44.527 --> 04:46.326
<font color="#FFFF00">It says how we won in the text book.</font>

04:46.327 --> 04:47.327
Forget the text book.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.326
We don't need it. You got me.
I am the text book.

04:49.327 --> 04:51.326
So, let's jot down the ways

04:51.327 --> 04:54.687
in which the Second Punic War
was in fact a defeat.

04:56.327 --> 04:58.166
Are you doing that,

04:58.167 --> 05:00.326
or are you just writing
the word 'Sabrina'?

05:00.327 --> 05:02.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, um... Sorry.</font>

05:02.327 --> 05:03.526
<font color="#00FFFF">Ooh, hello.</font>

05:03.527 --> 05:05.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Who's Sabrina, then?</font>

05:05.327 --> 05:07.326
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a girl in the year above.</font>

05:07.327 --> 05:09.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Keep talking.</font>
Or maybe don't, in fact?

05:09.327 --> 05:10.327
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, she's well fit, trust me.</font>

05:10.328 --> 05:12.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Everything about her's perfect.</font>

05:12.327 --> 05:13.327
<font color="#00FFFF">Sweet. She your girlfriend, then?</font>

05:13.328 --> 05:16.326
<font color="#FFFF00">No. Are you joking?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">She doesn't even know I exist.</font>

05:16.327 --> 05:17.327
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm nothing to her.</font>

05:17.328 --> 05:20.326
Just like the Roman army was nothing
to the might of Carthage.

05:20.327 --> 05:22.326
<font color="#00FFFF">So let her know you're something,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">brother.</font>

05:22.327 --> 05:23.366
<font color="#00FFFF">Get inside her head.</font>

05:23.367 --> 05:26.326
<font color="#FFFF00">She's in the year above. I can't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">even get inside her classroom.</font>

05:26.327 --> 05:29.326
<font color="#00FFFF">So build up your street cred.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Get people talking about you.</font>

05:29.327 --> 05:31.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Lay some traps then reel her in.</font>

05:31.327 --> 05:33.846
Just like Hannibal trapped the Roman
army in the battle of Cannae.

05:33.847 --> 05:35.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Stop making everything</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about history.</font>

05:35.327 --> 05:36.686
<font color="#00FFFF">Your man's bored shitless.</font>

05:36.687 --> 05:38.326
But it IS about history.

05:38.327 --> 05:40.326
That's literally
what we're doing here,

05:40.327 --> 05:42.326
and Barney will learn to enjoy it.

05:42.327 --> 05:43.327
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't think I will, actually.</font>

05:43.328 --> 05:45.326
<font color="#FFFF00">I sort of want more tutoring</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from him.</font>

05:45.327 --> 05:47.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my Jove.</font>

05:47.327 --> 05:49.326
<font color="#00FFFF">That's my specialist subject.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It's chirpsin'.</font>

05:49.327 --> 05:50.327
Which will come in really handy

05:50.328 --> 05:53.326
when he's writing an essay
on the Second Punic War.

05:53.327 --> 05:55.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Why don't you just write it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and then he can copy you?</font>

05:55.327 --> 05:57.326
Because that's cheating.
<font color="#00FFFF">So?</font>

05:57.327 --> 05:58.327
<font color="#00FFFF">You'll keep banging on at him</font>

05:58.328 --> 06:00.326
<font color="#00FFFF">until he writes</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">exactly what you want, anyway.</font>

06:00.327 --> 06:02.326
<font color="#FFFF00">I'd much prefer it, to be honest.</font>

06:02.327 --> 06:04.006
I bet you would.
Your mum may not, though.

06:04.007 --> 06:06.686
<font color="#FFFF00">I won't say anything if you won't.</font>

06:06.687 --> 06:08.326
All right, then.

06:08.327 --> 06:09.327
<font color="#00FFFF">Follow me, Barno.</font>

06:09.328 --> 06:13.327
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm gonna teach you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">my trademark sexy lip bite.</font>

06:16.327 --> 06:19.006
It's intelligent, yet readable.

06:19.007 --> 06:21.326
Provocative, but not glib.

06:21.327 --> 06:23.326
It's up there
with some of my best work.

06:23.327 --> 06:26.326
In fact, let me just read it to you.
<font color="#11FF11">Ooh, yeah, great, I'd love that.</font>

06:26.327 --> 06:29.326
<font color="#FFFF00">As would I, of course, but sadly,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm off out for a walk.</font>

06:29.327 --> 06:31.326
A walk? Since when do you walk?

06:31.327 --> 06:33.326
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm a life-long walker, sunshine,</font>

06:33.327 --> 06:34.327
<font color="#FFFF00">except for my first year or so.</font>

06:34.328 --> 06:36.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Gloria.</font>

06:36.327 --> 06:38.326
<font color="#11FF11">Morning, boys.</font>

06:38.327 --> 06:40.166
Gloria! Hi!

06:40.167 --> 06:41.366
Hello. How's it going?

06:41.367 --> 06:43.326
<font color="#11FF11">Could not be better.</font>

06:43.327 --> 06:45.686
<font color="#11FF11">Barney has been raving about</font>
<font color="#11FF11">his lessons,</font>

06:45.687 --> 06:47.326
<font color="#11FF11">says he's learned</font>
<font color="#11FF11">loads of useful stuff.</font>

06:47.327 --> 06:49.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Has he? I'm so pleased to hear that.</font>

06:49.327 --> 06:51.326
As am I, as his pedagogue.

06:51.327 --> 06:55.326
And I'm pretty confident he's going
to hand in a corker of an essay.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.366
<font color="#11FF11">That is such a relief.</font>

06:56.367 --> 06:58.846
<font color="#11FF11">I was beginning to think</font>
<font color="#11FF11">he was just a lazy oik</font>

06:58.847 --> 07:02.326
<font color="#11FF11">whose only interests</font>
<font color="#11FF11">were sleep and masturbation.</font>

07:02.327 --> 07:03.327
No. No, far from it.

07:03.328 --> 07:05.326
<font color="#11FF11">Well, thank you, Marcus.</font>

07:05.327 --> 07:07.326
<font color="#11FF11">Maybe I can take YOU for dinner.</font>

07:07.327 --> 07:09.327
<font color="#11FF11">How's Friday?</font>
Don't mind if I do.

07:18.327 --> 07:20.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Oi, wait your effing turn, lad.</font>

07:20.327 --> 07:22.327
<font color="#00FFFF">Piss off, bum face.</font>

07:23.687 --> 07:25.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Ah!</font>

07:25.327 --> 07:28.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Uh! Get out of it!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah? Or what?</font>

07:28.327 --> 07:30.166
<font color="#FFFF00">Ah!</font>

07:30.167 --> 07:31.326
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, geezer.</font>

07:31.327 --> 07:32.846
Hey! Hey!

07:32.847 --> 07:34.326
Hey, hey! Break it up!

07:34.327 --> 07:37.327
Break it up! You, come with me.

07:42.327 --> 07:43.327
What's your name, son?

07:43.327 --> 07:44.327
<font color="#FFFF00">Grumio.</font>

07:44.328 --> 07:46.326
Grumio, sir.
<font color="#FFFF00">Hm.</font>

07:46.327 --> 07:48.166
What form are you in?

07:48.167 --> 07:50.366
<font color="#FFFF00">Um... Five... B, sir.</font>

07:50.367 --> 07:52.326
Five B? What, you're 13?

07:52.327 --> 07:55.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Mm, yeah. That's right, 13, sir.</font>

07:55.327 --> 07:58.326
<font color="#FFFF00">And I am sorry about smacking</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that lad, sir, but he did start it.</font>

07:58.327 --> 07:59.327
Don't be.
<font color="#FFFF00">Huh?</font>

07:59.328 --> 08:01.326
Never apologise for a right hook
like that.

08:01.327 --> 08:04.686
Never seen such upper body strength
in a lad your age.

08:04.687 --> 08:06.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, cheers, sir.</font>

08:06.327 --> 08:09.326
Cards on the table.
I want you, Grumio.

08:09.327 --> 08:10.327
I want you in the boxing team.

08:10.328 --> 08:12.326
A lad with your natural talent,

08:12.327 --> 08:15.326
we could finally beat
Esquiline High.

08:15.327 --> 08:17.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, no, ta, I don't really do sport.</font>

08:17.327 --> 08:18.327
Oh, really?

08:18.328 --> 08:20.326
Would you rather I march you home
to your parents

08:20.327 --> 08:22.326
and tell them about
this little punch-up?

08:22.327 --> 08:24.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Mm, not really, no, sir.</font>

08:24.327 --> 08:25.327
That's what I thought.

08:25.328 --> 08:28.166
So, you'll report to training
tomorrow lunch break.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.326
<font color="#FFFF00">What? I'd rather not miss lunch.</font>
Oh, you won't.

08:30.327 --> 08:34.326
I make sure the boxing team
get double portions.

08:34.327 --> 08:35.327
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, right.</font>

08:35.328 --> 08:37.327
<font color="#FFFF00">Knockout.</font>
Good lad.

08:40.366 --> 08:43.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my Jove, there she is.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">That's Sabrina.</font>

08:43.327 --> 08:45.326
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't breathe.</font>

08:45.327 --> 08:47.326
<font color="#00FFFF">All right, yeah,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you weren't kidding, boy.</font>

08:47.327 --> 08:49.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Come on, let's go talk to her.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, how?</font>

08:49.327 --> 08:51.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Only sixth formers</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are allowed out at lunch.</font>

08:51.327 --> 08:54.166
<font color="#FFFF00">I couldn't get anywhere near her.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Damn this shitty gate!</font>

08:54.167 --> 08:56.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Alright, chill. Leave it with me.</font>

08:56.327 --> 08:58.326
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll go do some</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">quality wing-manning,</font>

08:58.327 --> 09:01.326
<font color="#00FFFF">build up the Barney legend!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">OK. Thanks, Jason.</font>

09:01.327 --> 09:02.327
<font color="#FFFF00">You're the best!</font>

09:04.327 --> 09:06.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Hey.</font>

09:06.327 --> 09:07.327
<font color="#00FFFF">You girls go to Aventine High?</font>

09:07.328 --> 09:09.326
Last time I checked.

09:09.327 --> 09:11.326
Why? <font color="#00FFFF">Oh, you might know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a mate of mine, Barney.</font>

09:11.327 --> 09:14.846
<font color="#00FFFF">Handsome, funny,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">sexually experienced?</font>

09:14.847 --> 09:16.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Year below you, I think.</font>

09:16.327 --> 09:18.326
Why are you mates
with a 15-year-old?

09:18.327 --> 09:20.326
You're a grown-up.
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, I know.</font>

09:20.327 --> 09:22.326
<font color="#00FFFF">His mum owns the laundrette</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">next to my bar.</font>

09:22.327 --> 09:24.166
You've got a bar?

09:24.167 --> 09:26.326
Wow.
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, it is a bit.</font>

09:26.327 --> 09:29.326
<font color="#00FFFF">When you're a grown-up, life's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">just like one big free period, so...</font>

09:29.327 --> 09:32.326
Is it? Well, you should come
hang out at the fountain.

09:32.327 --> 09:34.326
You can go halvesies
on my packed lunch if you like.

09:34.327 --> 09:36.326
<font color="#00FFFF">Could do. What you packin'?</font>

09:36.327 --> 09:38.326
Cheese sandwich.

09:38.327 --> 09:41.167
And an apple.
<font color="#00FFFF">Mm, old school.</font>

09:45.527 --> 09:49.166
<font color="#11FF11">I'm just saying, I found it</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a bit hard to follow and stodgy.</font>

09:49.167 --> 09:50.326
And I'm just saying,
you're an idiot,

09:50.327 --> 09:52.326
so stick to choral odes maybe?

09:52.327 --> 09:55.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Glass of red wine, please, bar man.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Make it a large one.</font>

09:55.327 --> 09:56.686
Really? It's only four o'clock.

09:56.687 --> 09:59.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Barney got his essay back.</font>

09:59.327 --> 10:00.327
Ah, great.

10:00.328 --> 10:01.846
So, are we celebrating?

10:01.847 --> 10:03.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Hardly.</font>

10:03.327 --> 10:04.327
<font color="#FFFF00">He got a D minus.</font>

10:04.327 --> 10:05.327
A what? A D?

10:05.328 --> 10:07.326
<font color="#FFFF00">Minus.</font>

10:07.327 --> 10:10.253
<font color="#11FF11"># Hate to say I told you so. #</font>

10:10.255 --> 10:16.744
For subtitling services, contatct:
waqas.zahoor89@gmail.com

10:16.746 --> 10:18.905
Ajax, you sit this one out,
I'm gonna give Grumio a go here.

10:18.906 --> 10:19.906
Up you get, son.

10:19.907 --> 10:22.905
Right, remember, footwork,

10:22.906 --> 10:23.906
keep your guard up,

10:23.907 --> 10:26.905
work the body.
<font color="#FFFF00">Got it, coach.</font>

10:26.906 --> 10:27.906
APPLAUSE

10:27.907 --> 10:29.906
CHEERING

10:32.906 --> 10:34.906
<font color="#11FF11">Fight!</font>

10:39.906 --> 10:40.906
CHEERING

10:46.906 --> 10:47.945
Well done, Grumio.

10:47.946 --> 10:49.905
That was incredible!

10:49.906 --> 10:51.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Cheers, I forgot to do the footwork</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and the guard stuff.</font>

10:51.906 --> 10:53.425
Oh, don't worry about that.

10:53.426 --> 10:55.905
It's the punching them in the head
that's the main thing.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.905
<font color="#FFFF00">I might go and get that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">double lunch, if I may.</font>

10:57.906 --> 10:59.905
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm feeling dead peckish after that.</font>
You go for it, champ.

10:59.906 --> 11:01.746
You're a killer!

11:03.106 --> 11:05.905
<font color="#FFFF00">"Littered with factual inaccuracies,</font>

11:05.906 --> 11:07.905
<font color="#FFFF00">"wild theories,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and absurdly long sentences,</font>

11:07.906 --> 11:11.905
<font color="#FFFF00">"this essay is a fiasco</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from start to finish."</font>

11:11.906 --> 11:13.105
I don't understand.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.905
<font color="#FFFF00">You read it, then?</font>
Read it? I was...

11:15.906 --> 11:16.906
all over it.

11:16.907 --> 11:19.265
The teacher has clearly
got it in for him.

11:19.266 --> 11:22.585
<font color="#FFFF00">I tried talking to Barney about it,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but he's in some teenage funk.</font>

11:22.586 --> 11:24.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Farting's the only noise</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I can get out of him.</font>

11:24.906 --> 11:26.905
Well, he's probably upset.
<font color="#FFFF00">He is! Devastated.</font>

11:26.906 --> 11:28.905
<font color="#FFFF00">But not about this.</font>

11:28.906 --> 11:30.905
<font color="#FFFF00">The girl he fancies</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has some suave new boyfriend,</font>

11:30.906 --> 11:32.905
<font color="#FFFF00">so obviously that is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the end of the world.</font>

11:32.906 --> 11:35.905
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll get the gory details</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about this essay shit storm</font>

11:35.906 --> 11:38.745
<font color="#FFFF00">at parents' evening and report back.</font>

11:38.746 --> 11:39.905
Or...

11:39.906 --> 11:41.585
maybe I can come too?

11:41.586 --> 11:44.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Really? I don't think we're quite</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at the co-parenting stage yet.</font>

11:44.906 --> 11:47.265
No, no, I know we're not.
Far from it.

11:47.266 --> 11:49.105
But for moral support, huh?

11:49.106 --> 11:51.905
And I'd quite like to meet this...

11:51.906 --> 11:54.906
Miss Marula, as it goes.

11:57.906 --> 12:00.905
The whole education system
must be totally fucked!

12:00.906 --> 12:02.905
If a cretin like that
can become a teacher,

12:02.906 --> 12:04.905
they may as well ask you
to work there.

12:04.906 --> 12:06.905
<font color="#11FF11">Any chance of asking him</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to work here instead?</font>

12:06.906 --> 12:08.905
<font color="#11FF11">I'm rushed off my feet.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, what's going on?</font>

12:08.906 --> 12:10.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Why have we got customers?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">They're all mates of Sabrina,</font>

12:10.906 --> 12:12.905
<font color="#00FFFF">so you're welcome.</font>

12:12.906 --> 12:14.905
Sabrina? As in Barney's Sabrina?

12:14.906 --> 12:16.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Mm, well,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she's more like my Sabrina now.</font>

12:16.906 --> 12:17.906
What, you?

12:17.907 --> 12:19.905
You're the suave new boyfriend?

12:19.906 --> 12:21.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, we're not going steads,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but yeah, sounds like me.</font>

12:21.906 --> 12:23.745
Isn't she about 16?

12:23.746 --> 12:26.265
<font color="#00FFFF">What?! No! Eff off. She's 17.</font>

12:26.266 --> 12:27.585
<font color="#00FFFF">Very nearly 17.</font>

12:27.586 --> 12:29.905
So she is 16?
<font color="#00FFFF">She is, yeah, technically.</font>

12:29.906 --> 12:32.905
<font color="#11FF11">Looks like you're the paedo</font>
<font color="#11FF11">these days, boy. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Oh, as if!</font>

12:32.906 --> 12:34.905
<font color="#00FFFF">She's extremely mature for her age.</font>

12:34.906 --> 12:36.905
<font color="#00FFFF">She likes olives, for example.</font>

12:36.906 --> 12:38.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Here, I'll introduce you. Sabrina?</font>

12:38.906 --> 12:40.745
<font color="#00FFFF">Sabby, babes,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">come and meet my mates,</font>

12:40.746 --> 12:41.905
<font color="#00FFFF">and Aurelius.</font>

12:41.906 --> 12:44.905
<font color="#FFFF00">All right, Jason's mates? Sick bar.</font>

12:44.906 --> 12:46.905
<font color="#FFFF00">No way! My dad's got that tunic.</font>

12:46.906 --> 12:49.905
<font color="#11FF11">Well, then,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">your dad must be one cool dude.</font>

12:49.906 --> 12:51.905
<font color="#FFFF00">No, he's a fat solicitor.</font>

12:51.906 --> 12:53.105
<font color="#11FF11">Is he?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Any chance of a top-up, babe?</font>

12:53.106 --> 12:54.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, sure thing, babe.</font>

12:54.906 --> 12:56.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Pop some more wine in that,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">will you, Aurelius?</font>

12:56.906 --> 12:58.585
Hang on, wine?
She can't have wine!

12:58.586 --> 13:00.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, relax, Grandma, it's fine.</font>

13:00.906 --> 13:02.905
No, it isn't! She is a child!

13:02.906 --> 13:04.905
If we get caught,
we'll lose our licence.

13:04.906 --> 13:05.906
She can have milk.

13:05.907 --> 13:08.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Milk? I'm not a fucking baby.</font>
Well, you're not far off.

13:08.906 --> 13:10.906
Are the rest of them on wine?
<font color="#00FFFF">Just a bit.</font>

13:11.906 --> 13:13.905
Right, get 'em out, Aurelius, now.

13:13.906 --> 13:15.945
<font color="#11FF11">Yes, sir.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, no, come on!</font>

13:15.946 --> 13:17.905
<font color="#11FF11">All under 18s out...</font>

13:17.906 --> 13:19.905
<font color="#11FF11">immediately! Come on.</font>

13:19.906 --> 13:21.905
GROANING
<font color="#00FFFF">Where am I supposed to take her now?</font>

13:21.906 --> 13:23.905
I don't know.
Maybe try the sand pit.

13:23.906 --> 13:25.945
This is well harsh. How come
the boxing kid gets to stay?

13:25.946 --> 13:27.906
<font color="#FFFF00">He's only in Year Five!</font>

13:29.906 --> 13:32.106
<font color="#00FFFF">Huh, kids say the funniest things.</font>

13:36.906 --> 13:38.425
<font color="#00FFFF">Sabs!</font>

13:38.426 --> 13:39.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Sabby, babe, wait.</font>

13:39.906 --> 13:41.905
<font color="#FFFF00">You said your mates were cool.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, sorry.</font>

13:41.906 --> 13:43.905
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">they were gonna be such geeks</font>

13:43.906 --> 13:44.906
<font color="#00FFFF">about the whole law thing.</font>

13:44.907 --> 13:47.905
<font color="#00FFFF">We could go shops,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">maybe get some sweets?</font>

13:47.906 --> 13:48.906
<font color="#FFFF00">No. I should go home.</font>

13:48.907 --> 13:50.905
<font color="#FFFF00">I've got a chemistry test</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the morning.</font>

13:50.906 --> 13:51.906
<font color="#00FFFF">Very sensible.</font>

13:51.907 --> 13:53.425
<font color="#00FFFF">OK, you get swotting</font>

13:53.426 --> 13:55.265
<font color="#00FFFF">and then we'll do</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">something proper exciting</font>

13:55.266 --> 13:57.905
<font color="#00FFFF">and grown-up tomorrow, yeah?</font>

13:57.906 --> 13:58.906
<font color="#11FF11">Traitor!</font>

13:58.907 --> 14:01.745
<font color="#00FFFF">Eh, Barno! What you doing here?</font>

14:01.746 --> 14:02.905
<font color="#11FF11">I live here.</font>

14:02.906 --> 14:04.905
<font color="#11FF11">What are you doing, more like?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Cuddling Sabrina?</font>

14:04.906 --> 14:07.905
<font color="#11FF11">You're meant to be my wing man.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I know!</font>

14:07.906 --> 14:08.906
<font color="#00FFFF">I am. Sort of.</font>

14:08.907 --> 14:10.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Who's the kid, Jase?</font>

14:10.906 --> 14:12.905
<font color="#11FF11">She doesn't even know who I am!</font>

14:12.906 --> 14:14.905
<font color="#11FF11">I mean, that is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">terrible wing-manning.</font>

14:14.906 --> 14:18.905
<font color="#00FFFF">This is Barney. I did mention him</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">briefly a while back.</font>

14:18.906 --> 14:20.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Look, Barn, you were right.</font>

14:20.906 --> 14:24.905
<font color="#00FFFF">She is perfect and therefore</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">unperfect for you.</font>

14:24.906 --> 14:27.905
<font color="#00FFFF">She needs someone mature and suave</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">who's gonna show her a good time.</font>

14:27.906 --> 14:29.745
<font color="#FFFF00">And you're way too short for me.</font>

14:29.746 --> 14:31.905
<font color="#00FFFF">I cannot wing man you any taller.</font>

14:31.906 --> 14:33.585
<font color="#11FF11">I thought you were helping me.</font>

14:33.586 --> 14:36.906
<font color="#00FFFF">I am! Hey, coping with knock-backs,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that's part of the tuition.</font>

14:39.426 --> 14:41.906
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, cope a bit better if you can.</font>

14:42.906 --> 14:44.905
<font color="#FFFF00">I never meant for this to happen.</font>

14:44.906 --> 14:46.905
<font color="#FFFF00">One minute I'm at the school gates,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">delivering some books,</font>

14:46.906 --> 14:48.905
<font color="#FFFF00">the next minute</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm in the sports hall,</font>

14:48.906 --> 14:50.905
<font color="#FFFF00">smacking the shit out of some kid.</font>

14:50.906 --> 14:52.905
OK, I think you've skipped out
a fair few minutes there.

14:52.906 --> 14:55.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Look, all you need to know is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I've found my specialist subject.</font>

14:55.906 --> 14:56.906
<font color="#FFFF00">Boxing.</font>

14:56.907 --> 14:58.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Specifically, under-14 level.</font>

14:58.906 --> 14:59.906
<font color="#00FFFF">Whoa!</font>

14:59.907 --> 15:02.585
<font color="#00FFFF">That is way worse than</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what I'm doing, to be fair.</font>

15:02.586 --> 15:04.905
Well, neither of you have exactly
covered yourselves in glory.

15:04.906 --> 15:06.905
<font color="#11FF11">Uh... you can talk.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You got a D minus.</font>

15:06.906 --> 15:08.905
Oh, that was a mistake.
I'm getting that fixed.

15:08.906 --> 15:12.425
Grumio, I cannot believe
I have to tell you this,

15:12.426 --> 15:14.905
but you need to stop
punching children.

15:14.906 --> 15:16.905
<font color="#FFFF00">No. I won't.</font>

15:16.906 --> 15:18.905
<font color="#FFFF00">We've got a crunch match against</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Esquiline High this week,</font>

15:18.906 --> 15:21.905
<font color="#FFFF00">and I'm gonna be absolutely</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">smothered in glory.</font>

15:21.906 --> 15:25.265
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, and there is such a thing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">as a free lunch, by the way,</font>

15:25.266 --> 15:27.746
<font color="#FFFF00">and your lad's on double portions.</font>

16:05.906 --> 16:08.905
<font color="#00FFFF">I am a little concerned</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about Barnabas's progress.</font>

16:08.906 --> 16:11.585
<font color="#00FFFF">While his latest essay</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">was much more...</font>

16:11.586 --> 16:13.425
<font color="#00FFFF">well, dense than usual,</font>

16:13.426 --> 16:15.905
<font color="#00FFFF">it also exhibited</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a certain arrogance.</font>

16:15.906 --> 16:17.905
<font color="#FFFF00">I would never describe Barney</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">as arrogant.</font>

16:17.906 --> 16:19.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, no, neither would I.</font>
Because he's not!

16:19.906 --> 16:21.905
And nor was his essay.

16:21.906 --> 16:22.906
Provocative? Sure.

16:22.906 --> 16:23.906
Original? certainly.

16:23.907 --> 16:25.905
Arrogant? No way.

16:25.906 --> 16:27.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Marcus has been helping Barney</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with history.</font>

16:27.906 --> 16:29.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, trying to, anyway.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Hm...</font>

16:29.906 --> 16:31.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Let me give you an example.</font>

16:31.906 --> 16:34.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, so,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">"While most historians assert</font>

16:34.906 --> 16:36.905
<font color="#00FFFF">"that the Roman army</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">defeated Carthage,</font>

16:36.906 --> 16:38.905
<font color="#00FFFF">"I propose that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the very opposite is true."</font>

16:38.906 --> 16:40.905
What a fresh perspective.

16:40.906 --> 16:42.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, fresh,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">as in completely idiotic.</font>

16:42.906 --> 16:44.905
<font color="#00FFFF">It's like he never even opened</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the text book.</font>

16:44.906 --> 16:47.905
Well, how else could he have come up
with such a daring argument?

16:47.906 --> 16:50.425
And maybe he's right!
Maybe Carthage did win.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.905
<font color="#00FFFF">The City of Carthage</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">was completely destroyed.</font>

16:52.906 --> 16:56.585
Including the slums and open sewers,
which needed replacing, anyway.

16:56.586 --> 16:57.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Their entire population</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">was enslaved.</font>

16:57.906 --> 17:00.905
And transported to Rome for free,
which was kind of a win for them.

17:00.906 --> 17:03.425
<font color="#00FFFF">It's genuinely quite offensive.</font>
Which is too much

17:03.426 --> 17:06.905
for a blinkered, jobsworth div
to appreciate. D minus is a joke!

17:06.906 --> 17:08.905
I should have at least got a B!

17:08.906 --> 17:09.906
He should have at least got a B.

17:09.906 --> 17:11.905
Barney.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.905
It's fresh.

17:13.906 --> 17:15.105
<font color="#FFFF00">You wrote it, didn't you?</font>

17:15.106 --> 17:17.265
I did, sorry.

17:17.266 --> 17:21.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Is there any chance Barney could do</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it again, on his own this time?</font>

17:21.906 --> 17:22.906
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, of course,</font>

17:22.906 --> 17:24.905
<font color="#00FFFF">but we do take cheating</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">very seriously,</font>

17:24.906 --> 17:26.906
<font color="#00FFFF">so I'm afraid he will receive</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a punishment.</font>

17:27.906 --> 17:29.905
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll bin this one, shall I?</font>

17:29.906 --> 17:32.905
Oh, well...

17:32.906 --> 17:34.905
<font color="#00FFFF">It's not like we can get into</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">any bars, can we?</font>

17:34.906 --> 17:36.905
We could go to a posh restaurant
or something.

17:36.906 --> 17:39.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Mm, that'll be well expensive,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">though.</font>

17:39.906 --> 17:41.585
Or go for a ride in your chariot?

17:41.586 --> 17:42.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Sure, if I had a chariot.</font>

17:42.906 --> 17:43.906
<font color="#00FFFF">Which I don't.</font>

17:43.907 --> 17:46.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, come on, it's not that bad.</font>

17:46.906 --> 17:48.905
<font color="#00FFFF">The playground's a bit of retro fun.</font>

17:48.906 --> 17:50.905
It's not retro for me,
I only just stopped coming here,

17:50.906 --> 17:53.905
and you said you'd show me
a good time.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.906
<font color="#00FFFF">And I will.</font>

17:54.907 --> 17:56.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Strap in, sweetheart,</font>

17:56.906 --> 17:58.905
<font color="#00FFFF">cos you're about to go higher</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">than you've ever gone!</font>

17:58.906 --> 18:00.265
Jase, be careful!

18:00.266 --> 18:02.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, see this is the benefit</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of going out with a grown-up.</font>

18:02.906 --> 18:04.906
<font color="#00FFFF">I can push much harder</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">than the boys your age!</font>

18:05.906 --> 18:07.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Let's do a loop the loop!</font>

18:07.906 --> 18:08.906
Argh!

18:08.907 --> 18:11.905
SHE SCREAMS

18:11.906 --> 18:12.945
<font color="#00FFFF">That was fun.</font>

18:12.946 --> 18:15.265
<font color="#00FFFF">Right?</font>

18:15.266 --> 18:17.945
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have
cheated like that.

18:17.946 --> 18:20.265
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not angry about the cheating,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Marcus.</font>

18:20.266 --> 18:22.905
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm angry you got such a shit mark!</font>

18:22.906 --> 18:23.906
<font color="#FFFF00">At least cheat well!</font>

18:23.907 --> 18:26.905
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought history was meant to be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your specialist subject.</font>

18:26.906 --> 18:27.906
Now I think about it,

18:27.907 --> 18:30.905
I may have misremembered my history
of learning history.

18:30.906 --> 18:32.905
I'm better at science,
if he needs help with that.

18:32.906 --> 18:34.945
<font color="#FFFF00">God, no! Keep away.</font>

18:34.946 --> 18:38.905
<font color="#FFFF00">If he struggles from now on, I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">shelling out for a proper pedagogue.</font>

18:38.906 --> 18:39.906
Fair enough.

18:39.907 --> 18:41.585
So, are we still on for dinner?

18:41.586 --> 18:42.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Wouldn't have thought so.</font>

18:42.906 --> 18:45.905
<font color="#FFFF00">You are going to be busy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this evening.</font>

18:45.906 --> 18:47.266
Wh...

18:48.906 --> 18:50.905
Right, this is the big one.

18:50.906 --> 18:52.905
Esquiline High.

18:52.906 --> 18:56.745
I've not won a fight against these
in all my 25 years of coaching,

18:56.746 --> 18:57.905
and I'll tell you honestly,

18:57.906 --> 19:00.905
I will love it if we beat them.
Love it!

19:00.906 --> 19:04.425
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, cos I were thinking,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">maybe Ajax could fight instead.</font>

19:04.426 --> 19:05.945
You what?
That scrawny little pecker?

19:05.946 --> 19:07.105
You're a killer.

19:07.106 --> 19:08.905
<font color="#FFFF00">There is a reason for that, coach.</font>

19:08.906 --> 19:10.585
Yeah, cos you're the real deal.

19:10.586 --> 19:11.905
A boxing natural.

19:11.906 --> 19:13.265
<font color="#FFFF00">And cos I'm a 29-year-old man.</font>

19:13.266 --> 19:14.905
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not even meant to be in school.</font>

19:14.906 --> 19:15.906
<font color="#FFFF00">I got mistaken for a kid</font>

19:15.907 --> 19:17.906
<font color="#FFFF00">and I kept coming back</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for the lunches.</font>

19:19.906 --> 19:20.906
Mm.

19:20.907 --> 19:22.905
I've heard what you've got to say,

19:22.906 --> 19:24.425
I really have, but the thing is,

19:24.426 --> 19:27.425
this is my only chance
to beat these bastards,

19:27.426 --> 19:29.585
so pretend that I haven't.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.945
<font color="#FFFF00">Mm.</font>

19:30.946 --> 19:32.945
<font color="#FFFF00">Fair dos.</font>

19:32.946 --> 19:35.905
<font color="#FFFF00">All right then, son,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">let's get it over with.</font>

19:35.906 --> 19:37.105
CHEERING

19:37.106 --> 19:38.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Bloody hell.</font>

19:38.906 --> 19:39.906
<font color="#11FF11">Fight!</font>

19:39.907 --> 19:41.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Whoa!</font>

19:41.906 --> 19:43.906
<font color="#FFFF00">Uh!</font>

19:44.906 --> 19:46.905
CROWD CHANTS: <font color="#00FFFF">Claudius! Claudius!</font>

19:46.906 --> 19:48.906
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh!</font>

19:50.906 --> 19:53.746
<font color="#FFFF00">Argh!</font>

19:54.906 --> 19:56.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you sure we're in the right bit?</font>

19:56.906 --> 19:58.905
Yeah, this is paediatrics.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Paedo-what-now?</font>
The bit for kids.

20:00.906 --> 20:01.906
Duh.

20:01.906 --> 20:02.906
<font color="#00FFFF">Right, yeah.</font>

20:02.907 --> 20:05.905
<font color="#11FF11">Fell out of a tree, my one.</font>

20:05.906 --> 20:07.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, right.</font>

20:07.906 --> 20:09.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Aw.</font>

20:09.906 --> 20:11.905
<font color="#11FF11">How about yours?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Hm?</font>

20:11.906 --> 20:12.906
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, uh... yeah, similar.</font>

20:12.906 --> 20:13.906
<font color="#00FFFF">Fell out a swing.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Oh.</font>

20:13.907 --> 20:16.905
I didn't fall, you pushed me.

20:16.906 --> 20:17.906
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, bit of both, maybe.</font>

20:17.907 --> 20:20.905
<font color="#11FF11">Well,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm sure your daddy didn't mean to.</font>

20:20.906 --> 20:21.906
You what?

20:21.906 --> 20:22.906
He's not my daddy.

20:22.907 --> 20:24.905
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, I'm sorry. I thought...</font>

20:24.906 --> 20:27.266
<font color="#11FF11">Are you the teacher, then, or...</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Boyfriend, yeah.</font>

20:33.106 --> 20:35.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Listen, Sabs, babes, we need</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to talk. </font>Yeah, you're dumped.

20:35.906 --> 20:37.905
<font color="#00FFFF">What? No, I was about to...</font>

20:37.906 --> 20:40.745
I thought dating an older guy
would be glamorous and stuff,

20:40.746 --> 20:41.905
but it's actually pretty lame.

20:41.906 --> 20:43.905
<font color="#00FFFF">Uh, one, it's not,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and two, I was dumping you.</font>

20:43.906 --> 20:45.425
Too late, I dumped you first.

20:45.426 --> 20:46.905
<font color="#00FFFF">I'd already started</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the dumping process.</font>

20:46.906 --> 20:48.905
You didn't finish it.
<font color="#00FFFF">It still counts.</font>

20:48.906 --> 20:51.906
It doesn't matter, Jason.
Grow up!

20:56.906 --> 20:58.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Hey.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Grumio?</font>

20:58.906 --> 20:59.906
<font color="#00FFFF">What happened to you?</font>

20:59.907 --> 21:02.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Got my head kicked in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">by a 13-year-old, didn't I?</font>

21:02.906 --> 21:04.905
<font color="#FFFF00">Kids today are proper vicious.</font>

21:04.906 --> 21:06.586
<font color="#00FFFF">Tell me about it.</font>

21:08.946 --> 21:11.585
<font color="#11FF11">Lines? That's pretty old school.</font>

21:11.586 --> 21:13.745
I know!
That teacher's a total prick.

21:13.746 --> 21:16.905
I've gotta write, "I will not
ask other people to do my homework,"

21:16.906 --> 21:17.906
1,000 times.

21:17.907 --> 21:19.265
<font color="#11FF11">Ha-ha.</font>

21:19.266 --> 21:22.905
Actually, isn't calligraphy
one of your specialist subjects?

21:22.906 --> 21:24.905
<font color="#11FF11">It is, indeed.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I have a beautiful cursive hand.</font>

21:24.906 --> 21:26.905
Well,
I would love to see it in action...

21:26.906 --> 21:30.905
about 993 times?

21:30.906 --> 21:32.905
<font color="#11FF11">That goes completely against</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the spirit of the punishment,</font>

21:32.906 --> 21:34.905
<font color="#11FF11">you realise?</font>
Uh-huh.
