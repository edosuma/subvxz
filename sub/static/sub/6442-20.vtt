WEBVTT

00:07.107 --> 00:11.134
Professor, why did we let Luthor do this?
Look at this place.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.745
He's done nothing but
defile our holy ground.

00:13.913 --> 00:16.177
History has taught us to
walk among our enemies.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.283
Yeah, while they walk all over us?

00:18.451 --> 00:21.011
I understand your anger, Jeremiah...

00:21.187 --> 00:25.089
...but we have no access to these
caves without his permission.

00:31.831 --> 00:35.323
Professor Willowbrook, thank you for
coming on such short notice.

00:35.502 --> 00:41.270
I didn't realize you'd be bringing
someone with you, though.

00:41.441 --> 00:44.899
This is Jeremiah Holdsclaw, future
leader of the Kawatche people...

00:46.112 --> 00:48.205
...and one of my brightest
graduate students.

00:48.848 --> 00:50.213
-Oh.
-He may be able to help...

00:50.383 --> 00:52.442
...identify the artifact.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.287
Jeremiah, it's an honor to meet you.

01:02.195 --> 01:04.492
Perhaps you could show us what you found.

01:05.932 --> 01:09.231
Yes, of course. Miriam.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.932
What do you...?

01:14.274 --> 01:16.401
What do you make of this, professor?

01:18.845 --> 01:21.075
Incredible. Palak.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.373
Palak.

01:25.552 --> 01:26.849
What is Palak?

01:30.623 --> 01:32.488
Ancient traditional cookware.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.316
Cookware?

01:34.727 --> 01:36.456
Beautiful example.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.493
Jeremiah, what do you think it is?

01:40.667 --> 01:42.464
I think the professor is right.

01:43.803 --> 01:46.829
I think we should take it back to the
museum to properly study it.

01:47.006 --> 01:48.997
Oh, no. It can't leave the cave.

01:49.175 --> 01:52.110
Not until I've had it
thoroughly analyzed. Miriam.

01:54.414 --> 01:57.315
If you are the friend of the Kawatche
that you claim to be...

01:57.484 --> 01:59.475
...then why won't you let us take it now?

01:59.719 --> 02:04.713
Professor, would you give
me the artifact, please?

02:07.127 --> 02:09.890
Jeremiah, you're embarrassing me.

02:10.062 --> 02:13.863
Professor, this is ancient Kawatche soil.

02:15.001 --> 02:17.231
Everything in here belongs to us.

02:17.403 --> 02:19.337
No! No!

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.589 --> 02:38.250
Give it to me.

02:42.795 --> 02:46.094
Give me the knife, Jeremiah.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.668
Find him.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.469
And bring me that knife.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.088
Professor Willowbrook?

04:50.590 --> 04:53.718
Those are a lot of steps for
an old man to climb.

04:54.727 --> 04:56.786
I'm sorry I haven't seen you lately.

04:56.963 --> 05:01.093
-Between the farm and school, l--
-No need to make excuses, Naman.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.833
Don't worry.

05:05.004 --> 05:06.562
Your secret is safe with me.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.231
I'm not Naman.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.138
It's just a story on a cave wall.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.114
Until last night, I believed that too.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.279
What happened last night?

05:18.484 --> 05:20.884
Your destiny was revealed.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.446
It's called Palak...

05:24.624 --> 05:27.821
...the Star Blade. It's been missing
for 500 years.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.791
Until Lionel Luthor unearthed it.

05:30.229 --> 05:33.357
It shines a light on Sageeth
so Naman can identify and destroy...

05:33.533 --> 05:34.761
...his greatest enemy.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.402
And Willowbrook came because
he thinks you are Naman?

05:37.870 --> 05:41.806
Dad, you should've seen the way he looked
at me. It was kind of overwhelming.

05:41.974 --> 05:44.875
Well, Clark, he thinks you're
the savior of his people.

05:45.044 --> 05:47.512
That's a lot to shoulder.
Even-- Even for you.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.908
Yeah, but I'm not.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.846
-I mean, I can barely take care of myself.
-Sit down.

05:52.318 --> 05:57.984
Look, you can't allow yourself to get all tied
up in prophecies written on a cave wall.

05:58.324 --> 06:01.191
Except some of the prophecies
are starting to come true.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.589
What?

06:02.762 --> 06:06.459
One of Willowbrook's students got ahold
of the blade, and it's given him powers.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.623
What exactly are we talking about here?

06:08.801 --> 06:11.702
So far, strength, speed
and he's bulletproof.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.469
How is that possible?

06:13.906 --> 06:16.101
The Kawatche were charged
with its safe keeping.

06:16.275 --> 06:18.709
Holding it, they're given
the power to protect it...

06:18.878 --> 06:21.346
...until they can deliver
it to the true Naman.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.205
Clark...

06:25.051 --> 06:27.042
...I had your abilities for a short time...

06:27.220 --> 06:29.984
...but, believe me, having all
that power was intoxicating.

06:30.289 --> 06:32.484
You don't think Jeremiah's
gonna give it back.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.120
No.

06:35.862 --> 06:39.628
Clark, you've got to find him and stop him
before Lionel Luthor gets ahold of it.

06:43.136 --> 06:46.572
Why won't you listen to me? I told
you I don't wanna talk about it!

06:46.739 --> 06:50.140
Note to self, forward all
telemarketing calls to Pete.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.675
You wanna tell me what that was about?

06:52.845 --> 06:54.779
It was nothing.

06:55.047 --> 06:58.710
Did you pull an all-nighter, or do you
just find changing clothes too cliche?

07:00.453 --> 07:03.013
I was a little laundry-impaired this morning.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.880
How bohemian of you.

07:05.057 --> 07:07.525
Hey, do you want to cover
the gymnastics tryouts?

07:07.827 --> 07:09.556
I'm sorry, can you find someone else?

07:10.229 --> 07:14.325
Pete Ross passing up the opportunity to
ogle Smallville High's women in spandex?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.866
Look, I just can't do it, okay?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.532
I gotta get to class.

07:20.239 --> 07:23.470
Well, hang on a second,
and I'll walk with you.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.347
Or not.

07:38.691 --> 07:41.421
-Dad, I came as soon as I heard.
-Lex, l--

07:41.594 --> 07:42.822
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

07:42.995 --> 07:47.989
Would you excuse us, please?
Yeah, I'm fine, son. I just...

07:48.201 --> 07:51.466
...bruised a few ribs, that's all.

07:52.038 --> 07:55.496
The rumor's floating around that
the person who attacked you...

07:55.675 --> 07:58.075
...was holding an ancient
Kawatche artifact...

07:58.244 --> 08:01.805
...that supposedly gave him
superhuman strength and speed.

08:02.915 --> 08:06.578
Well, if that were true,
wouldn't that be a prize?

08:09.021 --> 08:11.114
Is that why you've come?

08:12.925 --> 08:15.086
I don't live in the past anymore, Dad.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.786
Someone told me it was a weakness.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.029
Given your recent mishaps in the cave...

08:20.199 --> 08:23.134
...maybe you should start
following your own advice.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.434
Dad...

08:27.607 --> 08:31.941
...why don't you let me use some law
enforcement relationships to track this guy.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.604
Considering what you and I have
been going through recently...

08:35.780 --> 08:39.842
...this filial concern of yours is...

08:41.087 --> 08:43.647
...touching and a little surprising.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.855
Who are you, Lex?

08:49.762 --> 08:51.286
Dad...

08:51.864 --> 08:54.162
...no matter what our differences...

08:54.867 --> 08:58.030
...I'm always gonna be concerned
about your well-being.

09:01.140 --> 09:05.099
You know, Lex, the only thing more
bruised than my ribs is my ego.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.645
Any more publicity
would only embarrass me.

09:08.814 --> 09:11.510
So the cave....

09:11.684 --> 09:15.916
What do you say? Let's let
the matter drop, all right?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.198
You didn't get in?

09:30.670 --> 09:33.639
No, no. I got accepted.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.540
They turned down my financial aid,
which means I can't go.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.243
Well, wait a minute.

09:47.787 --> 09:51.484
Before you commit yourself to pouring
lattes in the Sunflower State...

09:51.657 --> 09:54.182
...why don't you talk to Lex?

09:54.360 --> 09:56.828
Chloe, I am not asking Lex for a loan.

09:56.996 --> 09:59.430
Why not? You know he would
happily lend it to you.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.561
But I wanted to do this on my own.

10:02.802 --> 10:05.930
Well, selfishly, I would be
glad if you decided to stay.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.166
But if Lex were in your shoes,
do you think...

10:09.342 --> 10:13.335
...that he would let one bump in the road
deter him from pursuing his dreams?

10:14.046 --> 10:16.139
Call him.

10:40.039 --> 10:42.530
Here for the prospective-students tour,
Clark?

10:43.109 --> 10:44.542
Did you do this?

10:45.044 --> 10:48.070
Now, what possible reason would
I have to ransack the office...

10:48.247 --> 10:49.908
...of an obscure teaching assistant?

10:50.416 --> 10:52.384
Then tell me why you're here.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.416
You first.

10:56.589 --> 10:59.649
Jeremiah was gonna help
me with a term paper.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.921
Term paper.

11:04.397 --> 11:08.561
Your visit doesn't have anything to do with
the fact that he went ballistic last night...

11:08.734 --> 11:11.897
...and absconded with a
sacred Kawatche artifact.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.334
I didn't know.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.602
Well, I'm surprised.

11:18.778 --> 11:23.112
I mean, you usually keep such a close eye
on everything that happens in the caves.

11:23.282 --> 11:27.150
-For those papers you're always writing.
-You still haven't told me why you're here.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.254
Well, according to the legend
of Naman and Sageeth...

11:31.424 --> 11:34.222
...this missing artifact bestows
extraordinary abilities...

11:34.393 --> 11:35.758
...on whoever possesses it.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.293
You don't really believe that.

11:37.496 --> 11:41.489
I like to keep my mind open
to extreme possibilities.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.867
You're starting to sound like your father.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.011
I guess I should be offended...

11:55.181 --> 11:58.708
...but it looks like he's beaten
us both to the punch.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.121
Tell me something, Clark.

12:13.365 --> 12:16.027
Do you have any idea what this might be?

12:20.806 --> 12:22.273
Oh...

12:22.441 --> 12:26.104
...if you find your friend,
tell him I'd like to meet him.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.769
And good luck with your term paper.

12:37.056 --> 12:40.822
Even if I knew where he was,
what makes you think he'd listen to me?

12:40.993 --> 12:44.019
But as I understand it,
you're not only his academic adviser...

12:44.196 --> 12:45.925
...but you're his...

12:46.465 --> 12:49.332
...spiritual counselor as well.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.027
-Yes?
-So why not just explain to him...

12:52.204 --> 12:54.229
...that the Star Blade isn't his to keep?

12:54.406 --> 12:58.433
-What do you know about it?
-I've read your writings, professor.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.772
It doesn't belong to you either.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.972
You know, I have a considerable
amount of influence around here.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.380
-Yes?
-ls that a threat?

13:06.552 --> 13:08.247
No. Of course not.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.513
But I'm fascinated by your work.

13:10.689 --> 13:14.090
I'm thinking about giving your
department a sizable grant...

13:14.260 --> 13:16.990
...so you can continue your research.

13:17.863 --> 13:21.629
Don't tell me an educated man like you
puts stock in old lndian legends.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.735
Look, professor...

13:23.903 --> 13:28.602
...you and I both saw what
Jeremiah did in the cave.

13:29.775 --> 13:32.266
I've suspected for some
time that there are...

13:32.444 --> 13:36.380
...special human beings who are
capable of feats like that.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.811
Now I know I'm right.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.446
If you've read my work...

13:40.619 --> 13:44.578
...then you also know that the blade will
crumble if the wrong person touches it.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.657
Yes.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.618
Sageeth.

13:52.264 --> 13:55.700
-Who is he?
-According to legend...

13:55.868 --> 13:58.496
...he's the bearer of darkness.

14:01.307 --> 14:05.676
Clark. Well, this is a coincidence.

14:06.078 --> 14:08.012
Nice to see you.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.147
Professor.

14:14.453 --> 14:15.943
What did he want?

14:16.121 --> 14:18.589
The same thing you do, Naman.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.788
Professor, please stop calling me that.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.353
One who denies his destiny...

14:23.529 --> 14:27.021
...can bring about as much pain and
suffering as your greatest enemy.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.191
Please, professor, I'm just here to help.

14:31.303 --> 14:34.500
I don't want Jeremiah to hurt
anyone, including himself.

14:34.673 --> 14:37.665
This mural was painted on
the blinds in his office.

14:37.843 --> 14:39.367
I tried drawing it.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.814
Clark, that's the slumbering place.

14:47.519 --> 14:53.480
The burial ground where the ancient
Kawatche used to perform death rituals.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.959
Jeremiah's writing his dissertation about it.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.029
Does it still exist?

15:19.518 --> 15:21.452
Jeremiah.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.261
Jeremiah doesn't exist anymore, professor.

15:33.065 --> 15:36.592
You can't allow the power of the
blade to cloud your judgment.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.902
It's made things very clear.

15:42.074 --> 15:45.874
Your duty is to protect the blade
for Naman. He's Naman.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.437
Him? He's not even Kawatche.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.185
Look, it doesn't really matter who I am.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.418
The blade is dangerous, Jeremiah.

15:56.755 --> 15:59.417
It's given me the strength of 1 0 men.

15:59.591 --> 16:02.389
I can shoot fire from my eyes.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.791
Don't you see, professor?

16:05.230 --> 16:06.857
I am Naman.

16:07.032 --> 16:11.128
You're misinterpreting
the prophecy, Jeremiah.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.901
All these years, I've listened to you.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.477
But now I can see you've held me back.

16:24.183 --> 16:27.084
You're afraid that I've become
more powerful than you.

16:27.252 --> 16:31.655
Jeremiah, it's the blade.
It's corrupting you. Just put it down.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.457
I don't take orders from anyone.

16:37.062 --> 16:39.360
I will be the savior of my people.

16:39.531 --> 16:41.863
I will bring Sageeth here and kill him!

16:42.034 --> 16:43.797
You don't even know who Sageeth is.

16:43.969 --> 16:45.766
You could kill an innocent person.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.504
The man I want...

16:50.342 --> 16:52.401
...is far from innocent.

17:09.395 --> 17:12.364
Stay out of my way, false prophet.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.304
Clark, do you have any idea
where he went?

17:53.672 --> 17:56.573
I'm pretty sure he's
going after Lionel Luthor.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.467
Because he thinks Lionel is Sageeth.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.170
I remember when you first
learned about this from Kyla.

18:02.347 --> 18:06.477
She said-- Thanks. She said Sageeth was
supposed to start as one of the good guys.

18:06.652 --> 18:08.415
But the prophecy isn't written down.

18:09.655 --> 18:13.318
It's an oral tradition, so it's open
to a million different interpretations.

18:13.492 --> 18:14.982
What's your interpretation?

18:15.160 --> 18:17.754
I don't know. Professor Willowbrook...

18:17.930 --> 18:19.158
...thinks that I'm Naman.

18:20.199 --> 18:23.225
And Jor-El wants me to be some
sort of Kryptonian warrior...

18:24.036 --> 18:25.936
...but I just want to be Clark Kent.

18:26.505 --> 18:30.669
Well, you are Clark Kent, and like it or not,
you're the only one who can stop this kid.

18:33.011 --> 18:35.002
-We need to warn Lionel.
-No.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.612
Jonathan, you just said--

18:37.783 --> 18:40.115
I don't want to give him information...

18:40.285 --> 18:43.277
...that can help him find this weapon
before Clark does.

18:43.889 --> 18:47.450
Son, what you need to do is, you need to
find Jeremiah before he kills Lionel.

18:48.293 --> 18:52.593
Dad, even if I do find Jeremiah, I don't
know how to get the knife away from him.

18:53.599 --> 18:57.467
If he does have your abilities, there's a
good chance that he has your weakness.

19:05.978 --> 19:11.507
Now, I know what you're going to say.
This faux Egyptian decor is terribly tacky.

19:11.683 --> 19:15.483
So I'm gonna need you to just use your
imagination and you will see the potential.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.088
And keep in mind,
location, location, location.

19:18.257 --> 19:20.122
-Hi, can I help you?
-Yes.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.624
Earl Grey, please.
And whatever my client wants.

19:22.794 --> 19:26.389
Take a look up on the second floor.
There's a very nice living space--

19:26.965 --> 19:29.229
Miss, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.669
The Talon's not for sale.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.965
Well, it is, dear.
Lex Luthor hired me to sell it.

19:36.608 --> 19:38.599
Excuse me.

19:39.044 --> 19:42.411
-I'm part-owner. You can't just--
-Take it up with him.

19:50.956 --> 19:54.084
You can't just sell the Talon
without consulting me.

19:54.493 --> 19:57.360
I thought that's what you wanted
so you could afford to go to Paris.

19:57.529 --> 20:01.363
No, I asked you to buy me out of my share.
I didn't ask you to sell the building.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.228
Either way, you get the money.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.927
I put my heart and soul into that place, Lex.

20:06.104 --> 20:11.167
My friends hang out there, it's a sanctuary.
I do not want it turned into a Kinko's.

20:11.343 --> 20:15.177
Lana, this may come as a shock to you,
but the Talon's not exactly a cash cow.

20:15.347 --> 20:19.113
And personally, I have no
interest in the coffee business.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.145
It's much more profitable
to sell the building.

20:23.021 --> 20:27.390
If the Talon is such a terrible investment,
then why'd you keep it this long?

20:29.761 --> 20:32.423
I thought that was obvious.

20:34.099 --> 20:36.499
I did it for you.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.702
I spend so much time swimming
with Wall Street sharks...

20:42.874 --> 20:44.535
...and boardroom barracudas...

20:45.110 --> 20:47.135
...that it's been nice to come up for air...

20:47.312 --> 20:50.145
...with someone as honest
and pure-hearted as you.

20:50.816 --> 20:54.081
In some ways, you're the
best partner I've ever had.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.912
Thank you, Lex.

20:59.224 --> 21:02.318
But you're leaving, and you're irreplaceable.

21:06.031 --> 21:09.194
So why hang on to something that's over?

21:13.272 --> 21:16.605
Unless, of course, this is really
about you having second thoughts.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.767
What? No, l--

21:20.078 --> 21:23.605
Because you've got to ask
yourself, Lana, who are you?

21:25.183 --> 21:27.947
Are you a small-town girl
content to spend her days...

21:28.120 --> 21:30.418
...gossiping in a coffee shop
with her friends?

21:32.758 --> 21:35.556
Or are you the girl who goes to Paris?

22:01.353 --> 22:02.911
What do you want?

22:04.723 --> 22:06.816
The same thing as you.

22:06.992 --> 22:11.156
To insure the well-being
of the Kawatche people.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.794
Then stop pillaging their caves.

22:13.965 --> 22:18.493
But who rightfully owns the cave, Clark?

22:18.704 --> 22:22.606
Your family? They seem to believe they do.

22:23.709 --> 22:26.439
That's funny. I could say
the same thing about you.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.243
You want me to leave the Kawatche alone?
Deliver a message for me.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.316
Tell them to return the stolen artifact.

22:33.485 --> 22:35.180
Well, I'd be careful if I were you.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.788
They say that artifact is dangerous.

22:37.956 --> 22:42.825
Acquiring anything valuable always
involves a certain amount of risk...

22:42.994 --> 22:47.124
...and I believe that that knife is valuable...

22:47.299 --> 22:49.665
...in more ways than one.

22:50.736 --> 22:53.796
-What are you talking about?
-We'll have to run tests to be sure.

22:53.972 --> 22:56.566
But I believe that that Star Blade...

22:56.742 --> 23:00.109
...is forged from the same metal
as the octagonal key.

23:00.278 --> 23:05.648
It might be possible to use the metal
from the knife to create a duplicate.

23:06.885 --> 23:11.322
-I thought the original was in the cave wall.
-My scientists haven't been able to find it.

23:12.591 --> 23:14.559
You honestly believe that I'd help you?

23:14.726 --> 23:17.160
Why are we playing games, Clark?

23:17.329 --> 23:21.231
You're as eager as I am to unlock
the mysteries of the cave.

23:21.767 --> 23:25.294
Even if I wanted to help you, the
Kawatche don't take orders from me.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.267
Don't be modest.

23:27.439 --> 23:30.408
I'm sure they believe, as I do,
you're a very...

23:32.277 --> 23:35.303
...special young man. They'll believe you.

23:40.786 --> 23:44.347
You can also tell the professor
that I can turn...

23:44.523 --> 23:49.222
...from being a loyal ally to
his very formidable nemesis...

23:49.728 --> 23:52.026
...in a heartbeat.

23:53.532 --> 23:55.523
The friend who becomes the enemy.

23:57.035 --> 23:58.969
I beg your pardon?

24:00.505 --> 24:06.034
Mr. Luthor, those caves may not belong to
my family, but this barn does. So get out.

24:18.156 --> 24:19.783
Professor.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.926
Have you found Jeremiah?

24:22.093 --> 24:24.857
Not yet, but I have an idea.
I need your help.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.021
I'm at your service, Naman.

24:27.199 --> 24:30.032
I know you want to believe it,
but I'm-- I'm not your savior.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.796
I mean, did you ever think
that Jeremiah really is Naman?

24:32.971 --> 24:35.371
He has all the abilities
foretold in the prophecy...

24:35.540 --> 24:37.667
...and he's gonna try and kill Sageeth.

24:37.843 --> 24:42.610
True, but he did not fall from
the sky in a rain of fire.

24:42.848 --> 24:46.249
Jeremiah is desperate
to be someone he's not.

24:46.418 --> 24:50.320
And you are desperate
not to be someone you are.

24:55.927 --> 24:59.829
Professor, I may be confused about who
I am, but one thing I'm not is a killer.

24:59.998 --> 25:03.593
You'd be surprised what you're
capable of when the time comes.

25:03.768 --> 25:06.032
Now, how can I help you?

25:06.204 --> 25:08.297
Well, if I can't find Jeremiah...

25:08.473 --> 25:10.941
...maybe I can get him to come to me.

25:11.109 --> 25:13.441
Do you have any way to contact him?

25:13.612 --> 25:17.070
I could try to pass him a message
through other members of the tribe.

25:18.116 --> 25:21.643
But after last night,
I doubt if he'll listen to me.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.618
That depends on the message.

25:42.407 --> 25:44.136
What are you doing here?

25:44.442 --> 25:46.933
Professor Willowbrook sent me a message.

25:47.112 --> 25:51.515
He told me that after he saw what
I could do, he knew he was wrong.

25:51.917 --> 25:54.647
-I'm the true Naman.
-I never claimed to be Naman.

25:54.819 --> 25:56.081
Liar.

25:56.254 --> 25:58.620
Willowbrook says you're a false prophet.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.985
That before I kill Sageeth, I have to kill you.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.668
What's this?

27:26.311 --> 27:27.573
Danny, what's--?

27:28.279 --> 27:31.407
What's happening?
Danny, why have we stopped?

27:44.896 --> 27:47.228
Danny?

27:51.836 --> 27:57.138
Hey, I thought I had the monopoly
on burning the candle at both ends.

27:57.442 --> 28:01.503
Actually, I was just heading to
the Torch to print out my term paper.

28:01.680 --> 28:06.379
Oh, yeah. What good are extracurriculars
if you can't milk them for office supplies.

28:06.551 --> 28:09.884
Just lock up when you're done
and try to turn everything off, okay?

28:10.055 --> 28:11.420
-Okay.
-Oh, hey.

28:11.589 --> 28:15.286
I saw your mom at the courthouse. You
didn't tell me she was up for a judgeship.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.160
Actually, she doesn't have the job yet.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.594
With her record, she's a shoo-in.
I was talking to a couple people--

28:21.766 --> 28:25.862
You don't stop until you
get your scoop, do you?

28:28.606 --> 28:32.064
I was just trying to show
a little interest in your life.

28:32.243 --> 28:34.575
I'm your friend.
I'm not just some random reporter.

28:34.746 --> 28:37.715
Oh, you see, that-- That's the problem.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.676
You're both.

28:39.851 --> 28:42.285
And it's pretty obvious
which one comes first.

28:43.588 --> 28:46.955
-What's with you, Pete?
-Not everything is public domain, Chloe!

28:50.028 --> 28:54.158
Now I understand why Clark gets so mad
at you for trying to bust into his private life.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.229
Here.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.943
-Clark!
-Clark!

29:12.217 --> 29:13.343
Clark!

29:18.523 --> 29:20.855
Jonathan, he barely has a pulse.

29:21.025 --> 29:22.515
Help me get him over.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.992
Oh, God.

29:30.535 --> 29:34.494
Martha, why don't you go get something
to help stop the bleeding, sweetheart.

29:50.088 --> 29:53.455
You better-- You better hurry, sweetheart.

29:55.093 --> 29:56.822
Come on, Clark.

30:23.221 --> 30:26.418
Jonathan, how did you...?

30:27.158 --> 30:29.422
I have no idea.

30:47.946 --> 30:50.005
Mom? Dad?

30:50.315 --> 30:53.113
Sweetheart, thank God.

30:53.952 --> 30:57.251
-What happened?
-We found you bleeding to death.

31:04.562 --> 31:07.326
Blade must've been made
of Kryptonian metal.

31:08.099 --> 31:09.464
I guess my body healed itself.

31:09.934 --> 31:11.595
Actually...

31:11.870 --> 31:13.735
...your father did it.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.768
How?

31:16.941 --> 31:19.102
I have no idea, Clark.

31:19.611 --> 31:23.980
One minute I was trying to stop the blood,
and the next minute you were healed.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.145
You saved my life.

31:27.752 --> 31:29.879
I didn't save your life, son.

31:31.256 --> 31:33.224
I was just the vessel.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.122
For Jor-El?

31:38.763 --> 31:42.062
Well, however it happened,
we should be grateful.

31:43.601 --> 31:45.796
He's not done with either of us, is he?

31:45.970 --> 31:49.133
Clark, Lex called last night.

31:50.008 --> 31:51.839
Jeremiah has Lionel.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.342
-I know where they are. I'll go.
-Clark...

31:56.514 --> 31:58.311
...Jeremiah tried to kill you.

31:59.050 --> 32:00.574
Martha...

32:01.452 --> 32:02.749
...Iet him go.

32:29.013 --> 32:30.605
Now, Sageeth...

32:34.185 --> 32:36.551
...you'll bring no more darkness
to my people.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.633
I don't know how you survived.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.418
But you won't do it twice.

33:29.574 --> 33:31.235
Dad!

33:32.110 --> 33:34.510
Lex, it's Jeremiah.

33:34.679 --> 33:38.012
-Where's--? Where's Jeremiah?
-I don't know, Dad.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.616
I'm gonna get you out of here
before he comes back.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.275
Where's...?

34:11.516 --> 34:13.005
Come on!

34:41.478 --> 34:43.913
According to Chloe's sources...

34:44.081 --> 34:49.349
...the doctors at Belle Reve think that
Jeremiah may never come out of his coma.

34:50.955 --> 34:55.085
I guess having all those abilities
really took a toll on his body.

34:57.495 --> 35:02.364
Well, son, at least we know that the knife
won't ever hurt you or anybody else again.

35:03.401 --> 35:06.165
It also means the prophecy came true.

35:09.273 --> 35:13.266
The blade glowed and then disintegrated
when they touched it...

35:14.312 --> 35:16.906
...which means either Lionel or Lex
is my greatest enemy.

35:17.081 --> 35:19.777
Did you see which one grabbed it first?

35:22.019 --> 35:27.116
No. But I don't need a blade to tell
me that Lionel Luthor's a bad person.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.452
If you're gonna believe this legend...

35:29.627 --> 35:32.994
...you have to face the possibility
that it could be Lex.

35:39.203 --> 35:41.068
I'm not ready to do that.

35:41.739 --> 35:43.570
Clark...

35:43.741 --> 35:45.902
...the Kawatche think that you're a savior.

35:47.178 --> 35:49.578
Jor-El wants you to be a conqueror. Now...

35:49.747 --> 35:53.979
...knife or not, you can't let
other people tell you what to be.

35:54.619 --> 35:56.086
Who do you think I'll become?

35:56.254 --> 35:57.983
I don't know.

35:58.156 --> 36:01.717
You could be the world's greatest hero.

36:02.193 --> 36:04.855
Or its most mild-mannered citizen...

36:05.596 --> 36:08.997
...but the only person who
can write your story...

36:10.768 --> 36:11.996
...is you.

36:25.216 --> 36:28.242
Is this where they're holding
the partnership meeting?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.047
We got another offer.

36:31.656 --> 36:34.352
Chloe and her dad.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.260
I never would have predicted that one.

36:39.630 --> 36:42.121
They want to keep the place
exactly as it is...

36:42.300 --> 36:44.825
...and let me stay on as part-owner...

36:45.002 --> 36:48.403
...so I can go back to work
when I get home from school in Paris.

36:50.908 --> 36:53.138
Sounds too good to pass up.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.441
I turned them down.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.619
Without consulting me?

37:03.788 --> 37:07.724
I don't think Chloe was ever really
interested in running the place anyway.

37:08.359 --> 37:12.557
I think she was just having some
trouble letting go of the past.

37:12.863 --> 37:16.993
But I don't want anything
pulling me back to Smallville.

37:19.770 --> 37:23.137
I thought about what you said, Lex.
About who I am...

37:23.307 --> 37:26.401
...and I decided...

37:27.545 --> 37:29.740
...I'm the girl who goes to Paris.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.201
Chloe, what are you doing here?

37:52.370 --> 37:54.838
I think I should be asking you that.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.836
Just give me a minute,
and I'll get out of your way.

38:00.778 --> 38:04.305
You know, when my parents split,
I hid out in the garage.

38:04.482 --> 38:07.007
I didn't have my driver's license yet.

38:08.085 --> 38:11.748
Your mom called today. She asked
me if I'd seen you, and I said I hadn't.

38:11.922 --> 38:13.856
She tried to brush it off.

38:14.025 --> 38:17.051
She said you were probably
hanging out with Clark.

38:18.195 --> 38:20.060
But you weren't.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.464
Mystery solved.

38:27.838 --> 38:29.169
Yeah.

38:29.340 --> 38:32.138
I'm guessing you didn't tell me
about your mom's job offer...

38:32.310 --> 38:34.710
...because it wasn't a good thing, was it?

38:35.413 --> 38:38.041
I thought she'd turn it down right away.

38:39.884 --> 38:42.409
But it doesn't look like
that's gonna happen.

38:50.328 --> 38:55.095
Well, having been through my
own version of divorce court...

38:55.266 --> 38:57.791
...I know how difficult it can be.

39:00.905 --> 39:03.772
Do you think there's any chance
that they'll work it out?

39:05.176 --> 39:08.111
My dad's helping her move to Wichita.

39:10.214 --> 39:13.706
I guess I just didn't realize
how bad it was between them.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.678
This just seems like an
excuse for her to leave.

39:22.259 --> 39:25.353
It just feels like it's somebody
else's life and not mine.

39:43.347 --> 39:45.212
Surprise.

39:51.655 --> 39:55.751
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about this prophecy.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.229
I've got a new interpretation.
Wanna hear it?

40:00.231 --> 40:01.789
Sure.

40:03.367 --> 40:04.959
May l?

40:15.746 --> 40:19.705
This Naman guy is supposed
to come from the stars...

40:19.884 --> 40:24.378
...have the power of 1 0 men
and shoot fire from his eyes, right?

40:24.555 --> 40:26.455
It's just an allegory, Lex.

40:26.624 --> 40:28.251
I know.

40:29.026 --> 40:31.995
But if one person could do all that...

40:32.430 --> 40:35.126
...he would be a formidable enemy.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.796
He could conquer the world.

40:41.505 --> 40:44.497
He could become a tyrant
if nobody kept him in check.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.203
So I've been thinking...

40:51.282 --> 40:53.910
...anybody who'd be willing to fight him...

40:54.084 --> 40:56.518
...would have to be pretty brave.

40:57.855 --> 40:59.686
Clark...

41:01.826 --> 41:05.592
...did it ever occur to you that maybe
the hero of the story...

41:09.333 --> 41:11.426
...is Sageeth?

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
