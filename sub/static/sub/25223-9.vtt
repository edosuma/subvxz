00:34.010 --> 00:36.060
Hello and welcome to Mock the Week,
I'm Dara O'Briain.

00:36.060 --> 00:38.040
Joining me this week are

00:38.040 --> 00:40.090
Nish Kumar, Kerry Godliman
and Ed Gamble,

00:40.090 --> 00:43.060
Rachel Parris, Hugh Dennis
and Ed Byrne.

00:43.060 --> 00:47.020
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:50.080 --> 00:53.010
We start with a round called
Picture of the Week.

00:53.010 --> 00:55.040
I show the panel a topical image
and ask them

00:55.040 --> 00:58.010
to tell me what is happening.
So, what's going on here?

01:00.070 --> 01:03.090
Is Jeremy Corbyn just leaning in
and saying, "Mazel tov"?

01:06.090 --> 01:09.020
It looks like Jeremy Corbyn
is saying, "Let go of my tie!

01:09.020 --> 01:10.090
"People are looking!"

01:11.090 --> 01:14.030
I think Jeremy's simply saying,

01:14.030 --> 01:17.040
"There's one episode left,
it's about a bodyguard having an

01:17.040 --> 01:20.050
"affair with the Home Secretary,
you've got to binge watch!"

01:20.050 --> 01:23.060
Is John McDonnell saying,
"Cock or ball"?

01:25.050 --> 01:28.050
That clearly looks like a cardboard
cutout of John McDonnell,

01:28.050 --> 01:33.000
but Corbyn is just there going,
"John! John!

01:33.000 --> 01:34.060
"What do you want for lunch?!"

01:36.040 --> 01:38.010
I know that face,

01:38.010 --> 01:40.080
that is the face of someone
who's left their straighteners on.

01:42.040 --> 01:45.030
Is it John McDonnell's offensive
impression of a blind guy

01:45.030 --> 01:47.020
in a BBC One drama?

01:49.080 --> 01:51.080
Yeah...

01:51.080 --> 01:55.080
You're right, it was poorly judged
on his part, I feel.

01:55.080 --> 01:58.030
Jeremy Corbyn is just looking
at John McDonnell and going...

01:58.030 --> 02:02.090
SINISTER VOICE: "This organisation
does not tolerate failure."

02:04.060 --> 02:08.000
I can tell you what it is, I can
tell you the actual answer. Go on.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.070
As far as I'm aware,
that is Jeremy Corbyn

02:11.070 --> 02:13.040
and John McDonnell.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.040
Oh, thank you very much!
You're absolutely right.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.020
Yes, this is Labour leader
Jeremy Corbyn pictured with

02:21.020 --> 02:22.060
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.

02:22.060 --> 02:25.040
This week, rumours emerged that
McDonnell's allies had been

02:25.040 --> 02:27.000
secretly plotting against Corbyn.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
McDonnell has dismissed these
rumours as "laughable".

02:30.000 --> 02:32.030
So, did you read about this?
They're rumours, Dara.

02:32.030 --> 02:33.060
We don't comment on rumours.

02:33.060 --> 02:35.030
Unless it's about Donald Trump.

02:35.030 --> 02:37.000
I hear he has a penis
like a mushroom.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.020
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Literally at the very end
of the notes I had -

02:45.000 --> 02:47.040
"How long until Trump's penis
gets mentioned?"

02:49.020 --> 02:51.040
Bravo, ding-ding!
You got straight in there.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.050
Yes, are we all agog
with the excitement...?

02:53.050 --> 02:56.000
Well, there's always been
a rivalry between them,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.060
because Corbyn has an allotment
and Old McDonnell has a farm.

03:01.010 --> 03:02.060
Yeah, but do you think...

03:02.060 --> 03:05.020
Is there an end to which maybe some
people in Labour are noticing

03:05.020 --> 03:08.040
that you they are not making an
enormous amount of ground at

03:08.040 --> 03:11.040
the moment on a Conservative Party
who look like a clown car

03:11.040 --> 03:13.000
driven by a scared librarian?

03:14.050 --> 03:17.000
Anyway, the Labour Party...
The Labour Party!

03:17.000 --> 03:19.060
Yes, they will be watching -
you're watching, aren't you?

03:19.060 --> 03:22.060
And you'll tweet us if we say
anything mean about
the Labour Party.

03:22.060 --> 03:25.050
Because we said you'd tweet us
last week, and you tweeted us!

03:25.050 --> 03:28.050
Oh, we had some fantastic ones.
I had a number of people who said,

03:28.050 --> 03:31.000
"Actually, Dara,
I'm very disappointed."

03:31.000 --> 03:33.060
And I'm going, you're not my mum!

03:33.060 --> 03:35.060
But somebody tweeted just going,

03:35.060 --> 03:38.040
"That's this Corbyn voter never
watching that programme again.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.070
"I do NOT enjoy being mocked."

03:40.070 --> 03:42.000
Er...

03:44.090 --> 03:47.090
APPLAUSE

03:51.090 --> 03:55.000
Where has one of Jeremy Corbyn's
closest aides been banned from?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.080
Spearmint Rhino.
Not from Spearmint Rhino.

03:59.010 --> 04:01.040
It's the Ukraine, isn't it?
It is the Ukraine.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.080
But what was weird about it was,
I thought he must tried to

04:03.080 --> 04:06.040
get into Ukraine and then been told
he couldn't come in.

04:06.040 --> 04:09.000
But no, he's never been to Ukraine,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.070
he has no interest in going
to the Ukraine,

04:11.070 --> 04:14.060
but he's been banned
from the Ukraine,

04:14.060 --> 04:16.019
by the Ukraine.

04:16.019 --> 04:18.060
His name is Andrew Murray,
he is an adviser,

04:18.060 --> 04:20.089
works a day and a half a week
for Jeremy Corbyn...

04:20.089 --> 04:23.080
And he is Wimbledon champion!
Not that Andy Murray.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.010
Because he's come out and told us,
he's explained it.

04:26.010 --> 04:28.060
Because he was regarded as being
too pro-Putin

04:28.060 --> 04:30.030
by the Ukrainian Government.

04:30.030 --> 04:33.020
It's not going to affect his life
much, is it? Yeah, it's like...

04:33.020 --> 04:36.050
It's like me being banned from
Chessington World of Adventures.

04:36.050 --> 04:39.010
It's not really going to make
a great deal of...

04:39.010 --> 04:41.080
Do you not want to go to
Chessington World of Adventures?

04:41.080 --> 04:43.090
No, I do quite like the idea,
actually...

04:45.010 --> 04:46.080
That was a bad example, then!

04:46.080 --> 04:49.080
Cos they've got a log flume that
goes through the tiger enclosure,

04:49.080 --> 04:51.050
I mean, you really don't
want to be banned,

04:51.050 --> 04:53.000
they don't have that in the Ukraine.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.060
With the best will in the world
to the Ukraine, unless I'm wrong,

04:55.060 --> 04:58.060
and the Ukraine tweets me and goes,
"We are very disappointed in you.

04:58.060 --> 05:01.050
"For many a year now,
flume has passed tiger."

05:01.050 --> 05:04.020
Sorry, is there a meerkat
in the building...?

05:05.040 --> 05:08.050
Wasn't he accused of being part
of Putin's global...

05:08.050 --> 05:11.090
Propaganda machine. He's like,
"Well, I've never met Trump."

05:13.030 --> 05:15.070
Also, just to point out,
for all we know,

05:15.070 --> 05:18.040
every single one of us is
also banned from the Ukraine.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.060
There's no way of knowing.
I'm sure they'd tell us!

05:21.060 --> 05:23.090
I'm a bit worried now that
I might be banned from

05:23.090 --> 05:26.090
Chessington World of Adventures.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.080
You're going to regret that joke,
aren't you?

05:28.080 --> 05:32.020
They don't like being mocked.
I didn't mean it... No, they do not!

05:33.080 --> 05:38.020
One of the tigers on the log flume
is going, "I... Raaaar!"

05:39.090 --> 05:42.040
Chessington World of Adventures,
from what I remember -

05:42.040 --> 05:44.040
isn't that a theme park?

05:44.040 --> 05:46.080
ALL: Yes!
Oh, my God!

05:46.080 --> 05:48.040
There are animals there?

05:48.040 --> 05:50.080
Yes, they also have a small zoo
there as well.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.010
Well, then we should go!

05:53.010 --> 05:54.070
I genuinely...

05:54.070 --> 05:56.090
I genuinely think
that's a very good idea,

05:56.090 --> 05:59.040
I just don't think I'll be
able to join you!

06:00.070 --> 06:03.060
Hey, can we all stop bigging up
Chessington World of Adventures

06:03.060 --> 06:06.090
with your usual bloody
anti-Alton Towers BBC bias?!

06:08.030 --> 06:11.060
Yeah, in other news,
what's going on here?

06:12.080 --> 06:15.010
Is that Michael Gove
at the worst bit of

06:15.010 --> 06:16.080
Chessington World of Adventures?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.060
If that cow doesn't like being
mocked, it's in trouble!

06:21.060 --> 06:23.090
Was this taken just before
Gove's horrific attempt

06:23.090 --> 06:26.040
to go one further
than David Cameron?

06:26.040 --> 06:29.080
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

06:32.090 --> 06:34.070
THAT'S what you applaud?

06:36.070 --> 06:38.000
Is Gove saying,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.050
"Look, I already said this country
has had enough of experts.

06:40.050 --> 06:42.080
"Now, someone help me
get on this horse!"

06:44.050 --> 06:48.080
He's probably going, "Oh, sod it,
I'll have my coffee black."

06:50.040 --> 06:53.060
I'm a Hindu, so all of this
cow mockery is very much against

06:53.060 --> 06:54.070
my religious beliefs.

06:56.020 --> 06:59.000
Is that Boris Johnson
ready for panto?

07:01.020 --> 07:03.020
I think this is actually
just very sad -

07:03.020 --> 07:04.060
it's just his only friend.

07:06.010 --> 07:09.010
What has Gove urged Tories
to do this week?

07:09.010 --> 07:13.010
He's urged people to give
the Chequers plan a go, for now.

07:13.010 --> 07:15.050
Then they'll mop up the mess later.

07:15.050 --> 07:18.060
For now? Absolutely, yeah.
He's basically said...

07:18.060 --> 07:21.000
He's gone on TV,
and in front of them, just gone,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.070
"Just sign up to it, we can just
wriggle out of it later!"

07:23.070 --> 07:27.000
And he's just said it!
Like, in front of everybody!

07:27.000 --> 07:31.060
And you're kind of like, you realise
the other people are listening?!

07:31.060 --> 07:34.050
It's never a good way...
It's like starting a marriage with,

07:34.050 --> 07:36.050
"Well, we'll stick
with this for now...

07:36.050 --> 07:38.000
"We'll change it..."

07:38.000 --> 07:40.050
What are you indicating there?
This whole...

07:40.050 --> 07:42.040
That's how you approach the spouse.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.080
Moving all your husband's
body parts around.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.000
"They're all right there for now,
but if you could just

07:47.000 --> 07:50.060
"pop them up to your chest,
that would be a lot more helpful."

07:50.060 --> 07:53.050
Who has Vince Cable suggested
he wants to succeed him as

07:53.050 --> 07:56.080
leader of the Liberal Dem...
The Liberal Democrats! Ohh!

07:56.080 --> 07:59.060
CHEERING

07:59.060 --> 08:01.020
Oh, not heard from them in ages!

08:01.020 --> 08:05.000
What the fuck is that?!
How many constellations...

08:05.000 --> 08:07.040
It's quite a tie. It's quite a tie.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.000
Dara, are you presenting
Vince Cable's tie?!

08:11.020 --> 08:15.010
No, Vince Cable wants me
to replace him as leader of

08:15.010 --> 08:16.060
the Liberal Democrats.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.020
I'm retiring from show business,

08:18.020 --> 08:20.060
and in fact I'm retiring
from public life entirely

08:20.060 --> 08:24.010
and becoming leader of
the Liberal Democrats.

08:24.010 --> 08:27.010
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

08:27.010 --> 08:29.080
The thing is, he's only stepping
down when Brexit's sorted,

08:29.080 --> 08:31.080
so I look forward
to 300 years' time,

08:31.080 --> 08:35.049
when the Lib Dems are led by
the ghost of Vince Cable.

08:35.049 --> 08:38.049
If they did the second vote, if they
did do a second referendum on

08:38.049 --> 08:42.039
Brexit, and they said, right,
this is the deal we have,

08:42.039 --> 08:45.040
let's vote, whether you think
that's a good thing or not,

08:45.040 --> 08:47.030
if it did get rejected, right,

08:47.030 --> 08:50.000
say it was the morning after and
it was like, actually, no,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
we've seen the deal,
not good enough,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.070
we've voted to remain, right?

08:53.070 --> 08:58.060
What happens -
do we all just go, "Oh, er..."

09:00.040 --> 09:02.070
"Just never speak of this again!"

09:05.080 --> 09:08.070
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

09:10.000 --> 09:14.020
At the end of that round, the points
go to Ed, Hugh and Rachel!

09:14.020 --> 09:15.050
Yay!

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Now we play a round called
A Visit to Lolsbury Cathedral.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.040
This game...
LAUGHTER

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
..involves Ed Byrne and Ed Gamble,

09:27.040 --> 09:29.090
so if you could make your way
to the performance area, please.

09:29.090 --> 09:32.030
This is a stand-up challenge,
I launch the Wheel of News,

09:32.030 --> 09:33.090
and wherever it chooses to stop,

09:33.090 --> 09:35.070
step forward and talk about
that subject.

09:35.070 --> 09:38.080
OK, here we go,
let's spin the wheel.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.020
The first subject is courage.

09:41.020 --> 09:43.060
Who's going to do that? Ed Gamble.

09:43.060 --> 09:47.000
There it is, the traditional
representation of courage...

09:49.050 --> 09:51.020
I got called a pussy the other day.

09:55.060 --> 09:58.020
You're all just going to sit there
and go, "Yup...?"

09:58.020 --> 10:00.060
But no, right,
I agree with the sentiment,

10:00.060 --> 10:02.050
I don't agree with
the choice of word.

10:02.050 --> 10:04.050
I think that is a wrong choice
of word to use,

10:04.050 --> 10:06.060
cos essentially what that person
was saying is,

10:06.060 --> 10:08.020
"I think you're so cowardly,

10:08.020 --> 10:11.000
"I feel justified in comparing you
to the vagina."

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I think that is very unfair
on the vagina.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.030
There is nothing cowardly
about that thing -

10:16.030 --> 10:18.080
that is the bravest thing
in the universe.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.060
It pushes whole humans out of it!

10:21.060 --> 10:23.020
Word I'd use to describe that -

10:23.020 --> 10:24.040
hardy!

10:25.080 --> 10:27.010
Rugged!

10:27.010 --> 10:30.010
It's the biological equivalent
of a Timberland boot!

10:31.070 --> 10:33.090
What do we use when we want
to talk about bravery?

10:33.090 --> 10:36.090
The balls.
"They've got balls. Big Balls."

10:36.090 --> 10:38.040
I think that's wrong.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.000
I can only speak for my own balls,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.030
but they shy away
from any sign of danger.

10:42.030 --> 10:45.060
Sometimes it doesn't even have to be
a dangerous situation,

10:45.060 --> 10:48.080
it can just be a slightly cold bath.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.030
You're like,
"I'm ready for this bath, here I go,

10:51.030 --> 10:52.060
"down to the water's edge..."

10:52.060 --> 10:55.040
They're having none of it, before
they even get to the meniscus...

10:55.040 --> 10:57.030
"Absolutely not!
Climb back inside him!

10:57.030 --> 10:58.040
"Go, go, go, go, go!

10:58.040 --> 11:00.070
"Don't forget the bag,
don't forget the bag!"

11:02.020 --> 11:05.020
"Fold it up!
Fold up the bag, real tight!"

11:05.020 --> 11:06.080
My balls are pussies.

11:10.020 --> 11:11.070
Thank you!

11:15.060 --> 11:17.000
OK, that leaves me with Ed Byrne.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Let's see what your topic is,
let's spin the wheel.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.080
And the topic is parenting.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.060
Don't you think she looks like she
wants him to put that kid down?

11:33.010 --> 11:34.020
Right, um...

11:34.020 --> 11:37.020
Yeah, my wife and I have adopted
a style of parenting known as

11:37.020 --> 11:40.000
spoiling the shit out of
the little bastards.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.050
We are spoiling our kids rotten.

11:42.050 --> 11:45.040
A couple of Christmases ago,
right, December, 2016,

11:45.040 --> 11:49.020
just before Christmas,
we took our children to Lapland,

11:49.020 --> 11:51.020
to visit Santa Claus!

11:51.020 --> 11:53.080
You know, the guy we made up.

11:53.080 --> 11:57.060
You know, that not-real person
we invented to take credit for

11:57.060 --> 11:59.040
the shit we buy our children.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.080
We got on a plane and flew
to another country

12:02.080 --> 12:05.090
to visit a fictional character!

12:05.090 --> 12:08.080
I can never make fun of people
for going to Lourdes ever again!

12:08.080 --> 12:13.020
We spent the price of
a decent skiing holiday

12:13.020 --> 12:14.030
going on...

12:14.030 --> 12:17.040
Yes, I did say that, that's how posh
we are in our house now...

12:17.040 --> 12:20.010
We spent the price of a decent
skiing holiday going on

12:20.010 --> 12:23.020
a wild goose chase for two nights
and three days to Lapland,

12:23.020 --> 12:25.080
running around after all these
actors pretending to be elves,

12:25.080 --> 12:28.020
leading us on all these
mini adventures to find clues...

12:28.020 --> 12:30.040
Actually, I loved it.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.080
I was so caught up in it,
by the end of the second day,

12:32.080 --> 12:34.020
I'm turning to my wife going,

12:34.020 --> 12:37.000
"God, I hope we're going to get
to meet Santa Claus!"

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
She's like, "Are you an idiot?
Are you?

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
"We're going to meet Santa Claus,
that's happening, it's a dead cert,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.040
"we've paid to meet Santa Claus."

12:43.040 --> 12:45.060
"Whoo!"

12:45.060 --> 12:47.030
And on the second night,

12:47.030 --> 12:50.010
Mrs Claus came to the hotel room and
read the kids a bedtime story.

12:50.010 --> 12:52.010
Who knew Mrs Claus was a Scouser?

12:54.050 --> 12:57.010
And then on the third day, on the
way to the airport, we found him!

12:57.010 --> 12:59.000
We tracked him down.
He was at his workshop.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.090
Should have looked there
in the first place.
Could have saved a fortune.

13:01.090 --> 13:03.080
And he was a really good
Santa Claus.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.030
Like, the beard looked real,
he was the right level of fat,

13:06.030 --> 13:07.060
he didn't stink of fags.

13:07.060 --> 13:09.040
It was great.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.000
And I wanted to blow their minds,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.080
I wanted it to be the most amazing
moment of their young lives.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.070
So, as we're leaving, I go,
"How cool was that?

13:16.070 --> 13:18.060
"We got to meet Santa Claus!"

13:18.060 --> 13:20.090
And the two of them look at me
and go, "Meh."

13:23.040 --> 13:26.070
That... That's not enough!
I'm sorry, that's just...

13:26.070 --> 13:29.000
I know you don't appreciate
how much this all cost,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.030
but we've been running around in
the snow now for 72 hours,

13:32.030 --> 13:34.080
and not a feckin' ski was put on!

13:34.080 --> 13:36.080
So, I'm going to ask you again,

13:36.080 --> 13:38.080
and this time I want to see
a bit more WONDER

13:38.080 --> 13:40.080
in your beautiful little faces.

13:40.080 --> 13:44.060
We got to meet Santa Claus, the man
himself! How awesome is that?!

13:44.060 --> 13:46.000
And the two of them are just like,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.030
"Yeah, but we met him last year
at Westfield Shopping Centre."

13:55.080 --> 13:57.030
Thank you very much.

13:57.030 --> 14:00.020
And the points at the end
of the round go to Eds!

14:00.020 --> 14:04.010
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

14:08.090 --> 14:10.010
Our next round is called

14:10.010 --> 14:12.010
If This Is The Answer,
What Is The Question?

14:12.010 --> 14:13.070
On the board are six categories.

14:13.070 --> 14:15.040
Rachel, which category
would you like?

14:15.040 --> 14:17.090
I will take Home News, please.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.060
OK, cool, your category is
Home News, the answer is...

14:22.050 --> 14:24.030
What is the question?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.080
Is it...

14:25.080 --> 14:30.050
..what does Vladimir Putin put down
his pants to make him feel manly?

14:32.020 --> 14:37.000
Is it just some of the reasons
Southern Rail have cancelled trains?

14:39.010 --> 14:43.020
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

14:43.020 --> 14:46.020
Is it quite simply...

14:46.020 --> 14:48.000
..what do the ladies love?

14:51.060 --> 14:53.070
What other characters
were considered

14:53.070 --> 14:56.020
before Rice Krispies settled on
Snap, Crackle and Pop?

14:57.090 --> 14:59.040
Is it what were three excuses I gave

14:59.040 --> 15:01.040
to skive out of work
when I had a proper job?

15:01.040 --> 15:03.020
Snowed in, trains aren't working,

15:03.020 --> 15:05.020
smell too good -
might distract my co-workers.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.070
Three things you should never lick.

15:12.030 --> 15:13.090
Yeah!

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Is it, what if we started
stockpiling

15:17.000 --> 15:18.020
in case of a no deal?

15:21.060 --> 15:23.010
Is it what are the most

15:23.010 --> 15:26.000
enjoyable things to wee in?

15:29.020 --> 15:31.010
Um... Right, any more attempts?

15:31.010 --> 15:33.000
Yeah, is it, name three things

15:33.000 --> 15:34.080
Katie Hopkins can't afford any more?

15:34.080 --> 15:36.040
AUDIENCE: Oooh!

15:36.040 --> 15:38.000
HE MOUTHS: Come on!

15:40.020 --> 15:42.040
What's the technical term
for when you come,

15:42.040 --> 15:44.020
fart and poop all at the same time?

15:44.020 --> 15:46.080
AUDIENCE GROAN

15:51.060 --> 15:55.010
When do you ever not fart and poop
at the same...? Do you ever...?

15:55.010 --> 15:57.080
I don't think that's the difficult
part of that trifecta.

15:59.080 --> 16:02.020
I don't think that's the surprise.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.040
Because if you come and fart at
the same time, you do a backflip -

16:07.040 --> 16:08.080
my friend Will told me that.

16:11.030 --> 16:13.040
Do you want the answer? Yes, could I
have the answer, please?

16:13.040 --> 16:15.080
Is it, what are the three things
that are kind of featured in

16:15.080 --> 16:19.020
the story of the Russian poisoners
in Salisbury?

16:19.020 --> 16:21.090
Of course it is.
Thanks very much, Hugh.

16:21.090 --> 16:23.060
APPLAUSE

16:25.050 --> 16:27.030
The breakdown of that one was,

16:27.030 --> 16:29.060
what were three of the excuses
offered up by the two suspects

16:29.060 --> 16:32.000
implicated in the Salisbury
Novichok poisoning?

16:32.000 --> 16:35.010
Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov
appeared on Russian state

16:35.010 --> 16:37.060
television to give outlandish
explanations as to why they

16:37.060 --> 16:40.020
visited the UK in March, and then
denied that they had any

16:40.020 --> 16:43.080
involvement in the nerve agent
attack. So what did they claim?

16:43.080 --> 16:46.030
That they just love Britain.

16:46.030 --> 16:49.050
And if they'd had another half-hour
left after their attempted

16:49.050 --> 16:52.030
poisoning, they would have joined
the National Trust.

16:54.070 --> 16:57.000
Weren't they on their way
to Stonehenge as well?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.070
Well, they said - but they'd had
snow, the snow - these two men

16:59.070 --> 17:00.080
who've lived in Siberia,

17:00.080 --> 17:02.080
they said the snow was too
oppressive in March, uh...

17:04.079 --> 17:06.060
I don't think those are
their names, are they?

17:06.060 --> 17:08.010
They sound really made up.

17:08.010 --> 17:09.079
They might as well have
called themselves

17:09.079 --> 17:11.089
Spy-dey McPoisonface and...

17:11.089 --> 17:15.040
..Ivor Bottleofnovikof...
or what is it called? Novichok?

17:15.040 --> 17:17.030
Yeah, it's called Nob-akoff.

17:17.030 --> 17:19.000
Are you thinking
of the famous spy...

17:19.000 --> 17:21.069
Are you thinking of the famous spy,
Hujanicka Bollockoff?

17:21.069 --> 17:25.000
Is that who you're thinking of?
Nickisandoff!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.060
No!

17:26.060 --> 17:28.050
That's taking me back!

17:28.050 --> 17:31.060
What was the dinosaur one as well -
Dyouthinkhesaurus?

17:33.010 --> 17:35.020
Yes, they claimed that they came
to Wiltshire to see Stonehenge

17:35.020 --> 17:38.020
and Salisbury Cathedral's
world-famous 123-metre spire

17:38.020 --> 17:41.090
because their friends "kept going
on at them about it." Yeah.

17:41.090 --> 17:44.020
IN RUSSIAN ACCENT: Going,
"You, you must go to Wiltshire!"

17:44.020 --> 17:46.080
Oh, is there another meerkat
in the building?!

17:46.080 --> 17:48.070
Yeah, your tiny little friend
would go,

17:48.070 --> 17:51.030
"Go to Wiltshire but do not drive
without insurance."

17:52.090 --> 17:54.020
The mistake they made, though,

17:54.020 --> 17:56.030
is that they obviously were just
rubbish, weren't they,

17:56.030 --> 17:58.030
but they didn't realise that
we have, like,

17:58.030 --> 18:00.090
a functioning border force,

18:00.090 --> 18:02.050
police force,

18:02.050 --> 18:05.040
security service and, uh, NHS.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.020
And if they'd just waited
till AFTER Brexit...

18:11.020 --> 18:13.020
..I think they would have got
away with it.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.050
My favourite thing about it was
the fact that they quoted,

18:15.050 --> 18:19.070
in the interview, they wanted to see
the 123-metre tall spire,

18:19.070 --> 18:22.020
and it was like they were reading it
off the Wikipedia page.

18:22.020 --> 18:24.060
Like, it's a bit like if I just went
to you, "Hey, Dara,

18:24.060 --> 18:27.090
"great to hang out with you,
Dara O Briain,
born 4th February, 1972."

18:29.050 --> 18:31.050
You really looked that up,
didn't you?

18:32.050 --> 18:34.000
I did a lot of Wikipedia-ing.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.040
Ed was the finalist in the 2007
Chortle Student Comedy Awards.

18:37.040 --> 18:41.000
And Kerry also appeared in
a 2011 Birds Eye polar bear advert

18:41.000 --> 18:42.070
for their new frozen king prawns.

18:44.060 --> 18:46.040
Crazy times.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.090
Rachel Parris holds
a second-class - 2:1 -

18:48.090 --> 18:51.020
Music BA Hons from
the University of Oxford.

18:51.020 --> 18:52.070
CHEERING AND WHOOPING

18:52.070 --> 18:55.010
Why didn't you clap
my Birds Eye ad?!

18:58.020 --> 19:00.010
Apparently it says about me,
it says,

19:00.010 --> 19:03.010
"Hugh has been banned from
Chessington World Of Adventures."

19:04.020 --> 19:08.060
It says that you were, uh... One of
your early televisual appearances

19:08.060 --> 19:11.000
was on Blind Date,
which I didn't know, Ed.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.060
Yeah, yeah. That's true. Yeah.

19:12.060 --> 19:14.000
Yeah. And it also said Hugh...

19:14.000 --> 19:15.020
Didn't get picked.

19:15.020 --> 19:18.030
Didn't get... Oh, you-you couldn't
let that go, could you?!

19:21.020 --> 19:23.000
Didn't get picked?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.040
HE MOUTHS

19:24.040 --> 19:27.060
That wasn't...
That wasn't going unsaid, was it?

19:27.060 --> 19:30.010
I have never seen you go
more Irish till now.

19:30.010 --> 19:33.040
IN EXAGGERATED IRISH ACCENT:
Oh, Lordy on a boat - oh, no!

19:33.040 --> 19:36.010
You couldn't let that go,
could you now?!

19:36.010 --> 19:37.070
Would you look at him, look at him!

19:37.070 --> 19:39.060
Old ha'penny looking down
on tuppence!

19:41.000 --> 19:42.060
I'm just saying that, like,

19:42.060 --> 19:44.060
you went on Blind Date and failed.
Eh, and...

19:46.040 --> 19:48.040
Tried doing your old cheeky thing
with your long hair

19:48.040 --> 19:49.060
and all that, like, didn't you?

19:49.060 --> 19:51.080
Yeah, my long hair, BALDY!

19:54.030 --> 19:55.070
Guys, don't fight!

19:55.070 --> 19:58.030
To be fair, this is exactly the sort
of journalistic rigour I'd

19:58.030 --> 20:01.060
expect from the co-founder and
co-editor of UCD's University

20:01.060 --> 20:03.080
Observer college newspaper.
All right!

20:03.080 --> 20:05.040
It's still going, mate!

20:05.040 --> 20:08.040
That's my legacy
you're talking about there.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.030
All right. And now, somebody look up
Nish now, right?

20:12.090 --> 20:14.000
It just says, "Nish Kumar"

20:14.000 --> 20:16.010
and there's a hyperlink
to Romesh Ranganathan.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.050
APPLAUSE

20:23.070 --> 20:26.060
The spies, they - uh, sorry,
not spies, the Russians...

20:28.000 --> 20:29.060
These Cathedral enthusiasts,

20:29.060 --> 20:32.040
they got asked if they went near the
house of the victim and they replied

20:32.040 --> 20:35.030
with the notoriously
innocent sounding phrase,

20:35.030 --> 20:37.060
"Maybe we did and maybe we didn't."

20:38.090 --> 20:42.000
Way to make yourself
sound trustworthy! Yeah!

20:42.000 --> 20:44.090
Also, they are somewhat hamstrung
by the fact that they look like

20:44.090 --> 20:47.010
two people who've gone
to a Halloween party

20:47.010 --> 20:50.070
dressed as suspicious Russian spies.

20:50.070 --> 20:53.030
They were both picked
before Ed in Blind Date.

20:56.070 --> 20:58.010
APPLAUSE

21:00.040 --> 21:04.020
OK, in other news, who has been
accused of eating too many

21:04.020 --> 21:05.040
pizzas and hamburgers this week?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.050
It's a load of South Koreans, isn't
it? It's a load of South Koreans.

21:07.050 --> 21:08.070
Why would they do such a thing?

21:08.070 --> 21:10.060
Because they're trying to avoid
National Service and they

21:10.060 --> 21:12.080
worked out that if you got
really large...

21:12.080 --> 21:14.040
Didn't they put on, like, 30 kilos?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.080
They put on 30kg
in six months, yeah. Yeah.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.070
And then were turned down
for National Service.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.090
Yeah, for being too
fat for National Service, yeah.

21:20.090 --> 21:22.070
Lots of people do... You know,
Donald Trump avoided it

21:22.070 --> 21:25.080
by saying he'd got bone spurs
on his heel.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.000
Whereas he should have just told
the truth and said he was

21:28.000 --> 21:30.080
a maniac who shouldn't be allowed
anywhere near a weapon.

21:32.050 --> 21:34.070
He has a condition known
as mushroom cock.

21:36.070 --> 21:39.060
If I heard this correctly,
it wasn't a real...

21:39.060 --> 21:42.020
It was the mushroom character
in Super Mario Kart, right?

21:42.020 --> 21:45.040
It was Mr Toad from... Mr Toad.
Yes, it was. Right, yeah,
that makes sense.

21:45.040 --> 21:49.040
So not only is it small and bulbous,
it's also got a face.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.010
They're my favourite kind.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.000
And it drives really well.

21:55.050 --> 21:57.090
I don't really want that
reminding me - next time I'm playing

21:57.090 --> 22:00.010
Mario Kart with my kids,
just like, "No, no."

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
"Just pick somebody else,
just pick somebody else."

22:04.000 --> 22:06.080
"Why, Daddy?"
Just pick somebody else!

22:06.080 --> 22:11.000
What would be your number one
cartoon comparison for a cock?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.050
Mine looks like Kaa
from The Jungle book.

22:18.020 --> 22:20.050
Mine's like WALL-E
from the film WALL-E.

22:22.060 --> 22:25.010
He's always kind of tidying up
around the place.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.080
Oh, I thought you meant, like,
Where's Wally, like, where is it?!

22:33.010 --> 22:36.010
Ahhh. I'm laughing along
to hide the hurt.

22:37.030 --> 22:40.070
And-And that's the story of the
Koreans escaping military service.

22:43.060 --> 22:46.090
This is a nice story, I think
the story of, like, 12 friends

22:46.090 --> 22:50.090
getting together to, like, overeat
in a lovely sort of body positive...
Mm!

22:50.090 --> 22:53.080
It's like this feel-good hit of
the summer, I think, isn't it?

22:53.080 --> 22:55.090
It's really lovely. The problem is,
they've set a precedent now

22:55.090 --> 22:57.030
and now everyone's going to do it

22:57.030 --> 23:00.000
and there's going to be
a Domino's effect.

23:01.040 --> 23:04.010
APPLAUSE

23:05.090 --> 23:09.010
At the end of that round,
the points go to Ed, Kerry and Nish!

23:09.010 --> 23:11.090
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

23:11.090 --> 23:14.080
Now we come to
Scenes We'd Like To See.

23:14.080 --> 23:17.060
So if everyone can make their way
over to the performance area,

23:17.060 --> 23:19.070
I'll read out this week's topics.

23:19.070 --> 23:20.090
LAUGHTER

23:20.090 --> 23:23.070
And then we'll see what our
panellists can come up with.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.080
LAUGHTER

23:24.080 --> 23:27.080
OK, here we go.
The first subject is...

23:34.020 --> 23:36.000
I am Thor!

23:36.000 --> 23:37.070
And next year...

23:37.070 --> 23:39.020
..I will be five.

23:45.070 --> 23:47.050
I've got you now, Catwoman!

23:47.050 --> 23:50.090
Your days of sitting on laptops and
licking your own hole are over!

23:56.090 --> 23:59.070
Why am I green?
Well, I'm made of kale.

23:59.070 --> 24:01.080
I am the Inedible Hulk!

24:06.020 --> 24:09.000
Ah, Superman! We meet at last...

24:09.000 --> 24:11.060
I-I can literally see your pants.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.020
Don't you call me a wanker,
you're a wanker yourself!

24:19.020 --> 24:20.070
That's right.

24:20.070 --> 24:22.020
I am White Van Man.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.040
GRUFF VOICE: I'm Batman. Nice to...

24:29.040 --> 24:30.080
COUGHING

24:30.080 --> 24:33.000
CHEERFUL VOICE:
I'm Batman, nice to meet you!

24:36.020 --> 24:38.010
Yes, Peter, I know
you're Spider-Man,

24:38.010 --> 24:40.070
but that definitely isn't web
all over your laptop screen.

24:40.070 --> 24:42.040
GROANING

24:44.080 --> 24:47.030
Right, I'm Captain Marvel
and you're Captain America.

24:47.030 --> 24:48.070
One of us is going to have to tell

24:48.070 --> 24:51.020
Captain Birds Eye
he's not in this gang.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.080
His whole place stinks of fish!

24:55.060 --> 24:58.000
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.030
This pilots' exam is harder
than I was expecting.

25:03.060 --> 25:06.030
I have collected all
the Infinity Stones.

25:06.030 --> 25:09.030
And I believe that means
I'm entitled to a free coffee.

25:14.010 --> 25:16.040
It's the Fantastic Four.

25:16.040 --> 25:19.010
Oh, no, it was stopped on
the boundary - just a single.

25:24.010 --> 25:27.090
A full-body titanium suit
with armour plating?

25:27.090 --> 25:29.020
No, thank you,

25:29.020 --> 25:31.030
I'll stick to this
small metal bikini!

25:35.000 --> 25:38.060
Hi, Spider-Man, yeah, uh, no, no,
I've got an STI, so when you say

25:38.060 --> 25:41.070
you were "swinging around New York",
what exactly did you mean?

25:47.070 --> 25:49.040
Commissioner, you sent for me?

25:49.040 --> 25:50.090
Yes, Human Torch.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.080
I need to find something
in the shed.

25:57.020 --> 25:59.060
I prescribe 50 milligrams of cheese

25:59.060 --> 26:01.080
and 60cc of cat hair!

26:01.080 --> 26:04.050
Benedict Cumberbatch is Dr Strange.

26:08.060 --> 26:11.030
They call me Catwoman because
I've got fur all over me,

26:11.030 --> 26:13.050
I stink of Whiskas and cat piss.

26:20.020 --> 26:21.030
Batman, come quickly,

26:21.030 --> 26:25.010
a Thai football team
is stuck in the Batcave!

26:25.010 --> 26:27.050
AUDIENCE: Ohhh!

26:30.020 --> 26:32.090
AS THE JOKER: Why so serious?!

26:32.090 --> 26:35.000
Oh, right, because I'm a scary clown
with weird make-up

26:35.000 --> 26:37.080
and I'm holding a knife.
Fair enough!

26:40.060 --> 26:42.020
I, Thor,

26:42.020 --> 26:43.080
LISPING: I thawr a puttytat.

26:49.090 --> 26:51.060
The next topic is...

26:54.080 --> 26:57.050
Dear Deirdre, I heard that
there is a way

26:57.050 --> 26:59.070
to get red wine out of carpets.

26:59.070 --> 27:02.020
Please tell me, because I really
want some red wine.

27:07.010 --> 27:10.000
My boyfriend says
I'm obsessed with quizzes.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.040
Shall I, A, leave him,

27:11.040 --> 27:12.080
B, seek help,

27:12.080 --> 27:14.040
C, carry on with my obsession?

27:18.060 --> 27:21.020
Dear Deirdre, I have an irrational
fear of agony aunts.

27:21.020 --> 27:23.030
Please don't respond.

27:26.060 --> 27:29.050
Dear Deirdre, I don't get on with
my partner's children.

27:29.050 --> 27:31.060
Uh, they're my children as well
but I don't admit that because

27:31.060 --> 27:33.080
they're absolute dicks.

27:35.090 --> 27:39.020
I'm a man in his 50s struggling
with his work-life balance.

27:39.020 --> 27:40.060
Should I... Sorry, got to go.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.060
I'm in love with my wife's
mother's daughter.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.090
Oh, no, wait, that's my wife.
It's OK. Bye.

27:52.060 --> 27:56.000
IN LADDISH VOICE: All that
emotional stuff, is that agony?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.010
I once caught my bollocks
in a lift door.

28:04.020 --> 28:06.040
Dear Deirdre, I can't help
putting my bike

28:06.040 --> 28:07.060
in other ladies' racks.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.040
Lovely Boris.

28:11.070 --> 28:14.080
Dear Deirdre, last week I had a car
accident and now my girlfriend

28:14.080 --> 28:17.080
isn't speaking to me, and she cries
all the time and I feel really cold.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.040
Oh, shit, I'm a ghost!

28:22.080 --> 28:25.050
Dear Deirdre, I'm embarrassed
by the amount of noise

28:25.050 --> 28:27.030
my wife makes during lovemaking.

28:27.030 --> 28:29.090
To be fair, she doesn't know
I'm still in the house.

28:35.020 --> 28:37.090
My girlfriend says I give up
on things too easily.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.040
Oh, well.

28:42.010 --> 28:45.080
Since my children left to go
to university, my life feels so

28:45.080 --> 28:47.020
meaningful and rich.

28:47.020 --> 28:50.020
How do I tell them I don't want them
to come home for Christmas?

28:52.000 --> 28:55.040
Dear Deirdre, my wife says I'm
a fantasist and a compulsive liar.

28:55.040 --> 28:58.000
Well, she's one to talk -
she doesn't even exist.

29:02.090 --> 29:05.060
I am a man trapped inside
the body of a woman.

29:05.060 --> 29:06.080
It happened last night,

29:06.080 --> 29:08.080
neither of us dared call
an ambulance.

29:13.070 --> 29:17.020
IN RUSSIAN ACCENT: Dear Deirdre,
I am very into steeples.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.080
Dear Deirdre, my girlfriend reckons
I should try and set

29:24.080 --> 29:26.050
a world record for masturbation.

29:26.050 --> 29:28.020
Do you think I can pull it off?

29:28.020 --> 29:31.010
AUDIENCE: Whe-e-ey!

29:33.030 --> 29:36.060
Dear Deirdre, in the daytime,
I come across as a really smart,

29:36.060 --> 29:38.040
cheerful guy who everyone loves.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.080
But in secret, I am definitely
a psychopath.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.020
Yours, Nish Kumar.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.060
Dear Deirdre, my wife says

29:49.060 --> 29:52.000
that I'm a serial philanderer
and a sex addict.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.070
So I guess my question is,

29:53.070 --> 29:55.010
what are you doing tonight?

29:58.070 --> 30:01.010
I just got my first period.
Should I be worried?

30:01.010 --> 30:02.060
Dave, 32.

30:04.090 --> 30:08.070
At the end of that round,
the points go to Ed, Kerry and Nish!

30:08.070 --> 30:11.020
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:16.050 --> 30:18.020
And that's the end of the show.

30:18.020 --> 30:19.060
This week's winners are

30:19.060 --> 30:22.020
Nish Kumar, Kerry Godliman
and Ed Gamble!

30:22.020 --> 30:24.060
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:24.060 --> 30:28.070
Commiserations to Rachel Parris,
Hugh Dennis and Ed Byrne!

30:28.070 --> 30:30.050
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:30.050 --> 30:33.060
Thank you for watching.
I'm Dara O Briain. Goodnight.

30:33.060 --> 30:35.050
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
