01:14.667 --> 01:18.159
When James Bond
gets an assignment,

01:18.166 --> 01:21.658
it's on the Riviera,
up to his 007 in bikinis.

01:21.667 --> 01:26.161
Me, I end up 80 miles
past nowhere,

01:26.166 --> 01:27.702
courtesy of my buddy,
Pete Thornton,

01:27.709 --> 01:28.698
new Operations Director

01:29.166 --> 01:31.157
of the Phoenix Foundation.

01:34.166 --> 01:37.704
And the guy who conned me
into running a security test

01:37.709 --> 01:41.702
at STRADA, Strategic Research
and Development Administration,

01:41.709 --> 01:46.703
run by a military hard nose
named Colonel Scott Woodward,

01:46.709 --> 01:49.701
who didn't like civilians

01:49.709 --> 01:52.701
or civilian think tanks
like Phoenix...

01:54.208 --> 01:56.699
even after Pete's introduction.

01:56.709 --> 01:59.701
This is the, uh,
acid test I promised you.

01:59.709 --> 02:01.199
MacGyver, meet
Colonel Scott Woodward.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.197
MacGyver.
Colonel.

02:02.709 --> 02:04.199
Woody and I were
in combat together.

02:04.750 --> 02:05.205
Follow me.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.745
STRADA was new,
not even open yet

02:10.750 --> 02:14.197
and top-top-secret.

02:14.208 --> 02:17.200
Guards, dogs,
alarms, electronics,

02:17.750 --> 02:21.743
gas, and maybe nuclear bombs.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.741
All I had to do was check
the security out

02:23.750 --> 02:26.742
by breaking in single-handed

02:26.750 --> 02:29.742
into a high-tech mountain.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.241
If I did, the military
went back to the drawing board.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.741
If I didn't, Woodward got

02:35.250 --> 02:36.740
the Phoenix Foundation's
seal of approval.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.240
Don't worry, Woody.
This is the last test.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.740
If MacGyver can't get in,

02:39.750 --> 02:40.739
no one can.

02:40.750 --> 02:41.739
Colonel,

02:41.750 --> 02:43.240
I hear Doctor Ludlum
designed the place.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.787
Yeah, but to military
specifications.

02:45.792 --> 02:48.249
We have the ultimate
security system.

02:55.250 --> 02:56.786
That's my little contribution.
You like it?

02:57.250 --> 02:58.786
You're standing on
a pressure-sensitive floor.

02:59.250 --> 03:02.242
You forget to deactivate it, and
the entire area's sealed off.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.286
And if you are lucky enough
to break in,

03:04.291 --> 03:05.781
you probably aren't
gonna break out.

03:05.792 --> 03:07.783
Least not alive.

03:10.792 --> 03:13.283
We don't take chances
with national security.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.290
Gentlemen.

03:30.291 --> 03:33.283
Entrance noted,
three individuals.

03:33.291 --> 03:36.283
Surveillance unit activated.

03:36.291 --> 03:38.828
Elevator descending
to central core.

03:40.291 --> 03:41.827
This way.

03:41.834 --> 03:44.826
Arrival noted.

03:44.834 --> 03:47.325
Initiate proper procedure.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.322
Palm reader.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.324
Strictly state of the art.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.324
Entry approved.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.823
Right down here.

03:56.834 --> 03:59.826
Welcome, Colonel Woodward.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.324
This wing houses the physics lab.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.870
What's in here?
Exercise room.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.867
There's one on every floor.
The scientists insisted on it.

04:07.875 --> 04:09.331
Civilian overhead.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.869
Well, now come on, Woody,

04:10.875 --> 04:12.866
the scientists know
what they need, don't they?

04:12.875 --> 04:14.331
I mean, they are closest
to the job.

04:14.333 --> 04:16.324
That same old song?

04:16.333 --> 04:17.869
Look, Pete, I
did what I had to...

04:17.875 --> 04:19.866
Excuse me.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.866
Mind if I look around?

04:21.875 --> 04:23.866
No, no, go ahead.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.365
Thanks.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.366
So this is your main guy?

04:30.375 --> 04:32.366
What makes him so special?

04:32.375 --> 04:34.866
He doesn't even have any gear.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.866
That's what makes him
so special.

04:48.917 --> 04:50.908
Lab looked pretty normal.

04:55.375 --> 04:59.368
Funny, security seemed
to stop at the front door.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.912
State-of-the-art
radiation scanner.

05:04.417 --> 05:06.908
Wonder what it was scanning.

05:50.458 --> 05:54.451
Making waves already,
Mr. MacGyver?

05:54.458 --> 05:55.948
Motion detectors?

05:56.458 --> 05:57.447
Heat seekers.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.449
They yero in on
your body temperature.

05:59.458 --> 06:00.948
Do they bite?

06:01.458 --> 06:02.948
30,000 watts of laser

06:02.959 --> 06:05.450
is a whole lot more
than a peck on the cheek.

06:06.001 --> 06:07.457
Good dogs.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.995
Containment
simulation completed.

06:10.001 --> 06:11.457
All drones deactivate.

06:15.001 --> 06:16.457
MacGyver,

06:16.458 --> 06:19.450
sometime consultant for
the Phoenix Foundation,

06:19.458 --> 06:22.450
alleged hockey player,
camel smuggler.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.494
Jack-of-all-trades.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.491
Jill Melissa Ludlum.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.990
Born in London,

06:28.001 --> 06:31.493
Ph.D. Systems Design,
Oxford University, 1980.

06:32.001 --> 06:35.994
1980 to '82, designed
the Ludlum cybernetic circuit.

06:36.001 --> 06:37.992
'82 to '83...

06:38.500 --> 06:39.990
took a year off

06:40.001 --> 06:41.992
for personal reasons.

06:42.001 --> 06:46.495
'83 to '86, immersed
in the STRADA project.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.991
Hasn't come up for air yet.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.492
Purported to be
a premier technocrat.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.991
You've done your homework.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.991
So have you.
Is it true?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.992
The, uh... technocrat part?

07:00.500 --> 07:01.489
Let's just say that my, uh,

07:01.500 --> 07:05.994
faith in machines has created
a fifth-generation computer.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.539
It's just a blink away from
true artificial intelligence.

07:10.542 --> 07:12.533
A machine that
thinks for itself?

07:12.542 --> 07:14.533
That's right.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.991
I don't know, Pete.
I never figured that

07:18.000 --> 07:20.537
you'd end up as Director of
Operations for a think tank.

07:20.542 --> 07:21.998
I really believed
that the military life

07:22.000 --> 07:22.989
agreed with both of us.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.037
It agreed with you.

07:26.041 --> 07:29.033
Are you here to certify this
place or to open up old wounds?

07:29.041 --> 07:30.531
Listen, why don't
we just forget it?

07:31.041 --> 07:32.030
Why don't we?

07:32.041 --> 07:33.531
So, tell me about Louise.

07:33.542 --> 07:34.531
How's she doing?

07:34.542 --> 07:37.033
She's all right... now.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.030
We split up.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.032
Sorry, I didn't know.

07:40.041 --> 07:41.531
It was coming.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.032
Oh, there you are.

07:43.041 --> 07:46.033
We were beginning to wonder
what was keeping you.

07:46.041 --> 07:48.578
MacGyver ran into
our security patrol.

07:48.583 --> 07:51.040
Nice guys... little
short, but nice.

07:51.041 --> 07:52.577
Peter Thornton,
I'm Jill Ludlum.

07:52.583 --> 07:53.572
How do you do?

07:53.583 --> 07:55.039
This is Steven Lee,

07:55.041 --> 07:56.577
my assistant.
Hello. How do you do?

07:57.041 --> 07:58.577
And this is Sandi,

07:59.041 --> 08:01.032
the computer that runs STRADA.

08:01.041 --> 08:03.578
Sandi, access the facility
schematic, please.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.074
Voice pattern identified.

08:06.583 --> 08:09.575
Good morning, Doctor Ludlum.

08:10.083 --> 08:14.577
Complying with
schematic request.

08:14.583 --> 08:16.073
We're going to give you
all the advantages

08:16.583 --> 08:17.572
an insider would have,

08:17.583 --> 08:19.073
though I doubt it would
make a difference.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.574
Looks like this is gonna
be a tough lady to beat.

08:21.583 --> 08:24.074
The complex has five levels
around an inner core.

08:24.083 --> 08:26.074
100,000 square feet of
laboratory space

08:26.083 --> 08:27.619
on each level.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.617
I'd hate to be the one that had
to do the floors around here.

08:30.625 --> 08:32.081
Sandi, would you like to continue?

08:32.082 --> 08:34.620
Operations controlled,
level three,

08:35.082 --> 08:38.621
surveillance maintained,
video monitors.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.616
Laser drones programmed.

08:40.625 --> 08:43.616
Doctor Ludlum has decided to
go without guards

08:43.625 --> 08:45.616
once the system is on line.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.115
That's right.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.616
We've completely eliminated
the human factor.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.115
Now, why would you want
to do that?

08:51.125 --> 08:54.117
90o/o of security breaches
are due to human error.

08:54.625 --> 08:56.115
Machines don't make mistakes.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.115
Come on, Doctor.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.115
No machine is invincible.

09:00.625 --> 09:01.614
This one is.

09:01.625 --> 09:02.614
I built her.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.614
Right.

09:03.625 --> 09:05.115
A quarter says she is.

09:09.125 --> 09:11.116
I think the gauntlet
just got thrown.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.659
Wouldn't want to take
the lady's money, Pete.

09:14.667 --> 09:17.659
The bet is for 25 cents,
Mr. MacGyver.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.124
And you wouldn't be taking it.
You'd have to come get it.

09:23.667 --> 09:26.158
It's a deal.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.656
Undetected.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.659
Level two. Physics lab.

09:31.667 --> 09:33.157
Whew.

09:37.166 --> 09:40.158
The last security shift
leaves at midnight.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.657
After that, it's just
you, me and Sandi.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.702
Man against machine.
How coyy, huh?

09:44.709 --> 09:49.703
We're depending on your
human factor, Mr. MacGyver.

09:49.709 --> 09:51.700
We'll be in the mobile unit

09:51.709 --> 09:52.698
monitoring your progress.

09:52.709 --> 09:54.165
Or lack of.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.703
Oh, just one piece of free advice:

09:56.709 --> 09:58.700
I've already changed
the entry code.

09:58.709 --> 10:01.155
I'll see ya later, Doc.

10:07.208 --> 10:10.200
Don't count on it.

10:10.208 --> 10:13.700
The simulation program
is up and running.

10:13.709 --> 10:16.701
My estimate is Sandi will
catch him in... 15 minutes.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.700
Wouldn't be so sure
this time, Steven.

10:18.709 --> 10:19.698
Oh, come on, Pete.

10:19.709 --> 10:22.200
He's giving MacGyver
the benefit of the doubt.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.199
We got your last
expert in ten. Hmm?

10:36.208 --> 10:38.745
Colonel Woodward dumped me
a mile down the road,

10:38.750 --> 10:40.741
just to make it
a little more interesting.

10:42.750 --> 10:43.739
And that gave me a chance

10:44.250 --> 10:45.740
to get the pattern
of the security patrols.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.741
I was kind of hoping
to catch a ride

10:49.750 --> 10:51.240
from a couple of the guards.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.240
And here they were.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.781
You ready?

12:26.333 --> 12:28.324
Calgary lost again.

12:51.875 --> 12:53.866
Map light.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.866
That's a start.

12:56.375 --> 13:00.368
Comes with its own
magnifying lens. Nice.

13:00.875 --> 13:04.367
It took the human race
three million years

13:04.375 --> 13:06.912
to invent the telescope.

13:06.917 --> 13:09.909
I figure I had
about 35 seconds.

13:09.917 --> 13:13.364
On the other hand,
I knew it could be done.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.908
Take the magnifying lens...

13:20.917 --> 13:22.908
add a watch crystal...

13:31.917 --> 13:35.409
roll them up in
the ever-useful sports pages,

13:35.417 --> 13:37.408
and it ought to work.

13:37.417 --> 13:41.410
Besides,
I didn't have much choice.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.950
I got it.

14:00.959 --> 14:04.451
Four-seven-one-yero.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.449
Beautiful.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.449
Sandi,
how's the perimeter security?

14:23.458 --> 14:25.449
Perimeter security intact.

14:26.001 --> 14:27.992
All guards
preparing to leave premises.

14:30.001 --> 14:34.449
Attention. All guards
must leave compound immediately.

14:35.001 --> 14:38.448
All guards must leave compound
immediately.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.990
Little problem here.

14:54.001 --> 14:57.493
I had forgotten
to bring along a card key.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.992
But you can't let something
like that throw you

15:01.001 --> 15:02.992
just because of a laser trap.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.490
One of the things
I used to love

15:13.000 --> 15:14.490
about the circus
was the way they worked

15:14.500 --> 15:17.992
without a safety net.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.491
Scared me then.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.991
Still does.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.991
Especially with
a 20,000-volt laser

15:26.542 --> 15:27.998
ready to yap me.

15:50.041 --> 15:53.033
Four-seven-one-yero.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.040
Arrival noted.

16:18.041 --> 16:22.034
Initiate proper procedure.

16:22.041 --> 16:24.578
The view from the second floor
was terrific.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.575
More of Jill's
patented security,

16:27.583 --> 16:30.074
and my handprint
wasn't cleared.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.074
Lucky thing most people
have sweaty hands...

16:32.083 --> 16:33.573
even Colonel Woodward.

16:44.625 --> 16:46.081
Enough plaster dust,

16:46.083 --> 16:50.076
and I could pick up the pattern
of the last handprint.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.620
Kind of like dusting
for fingerprints.

17:17.125 --> 17:20.117
Cover the sensor plate...

17:21.625 --> 17:25.664
press down gently...

17:25.666 --> 17:27.123
and what do you know?

17:27.125 --> 17:28.661
An instant copy machine.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.114
Entry approved.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.123
Welcome, Colonel Woodward.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.114
Thanks, Woody.

17:33.667 --> 17:35.123
64 degrees? That's low.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.658
Variable is within limits

17:37.667 --> 17:39.658
of standard deviation,
Dr. Ludlum.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.124
Readjust to 68, please.

17:42.125 --> 17:45.162
Readjustment is not required.

17:45.166 --> 17:48.158
Execute adjustment.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.157
Very well, Dr. Ludlum.

18:07.166 --> 18:08.155
Hi.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.702
Hi.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.165
Guess you owe me a quarter, huh?

18:11.166 --> 18:12.155
I don't think so.

18:12.709 --> 18:13.698
I got in, didn't I?

18:13.709 --> 18:15.165
You came in with the truck,
didn't you?

18:15.709 --> 18:17.700
Under it.
Perfect.

18:17.709 --> 18:19.165
I've been arguing
with Colonel Woodward

18:19.709 --> 18:21.165
about installing a scanner
outside the cave.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.702
Now he'll have
to spring for it.

18:22.709 --> 18:24.165
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute here.

18:24.709 --> 18:25.698
You mean to tell me

18:25.709 --> 18:27.199
this was a setup?

18:27.208 --> 18:29.699
You let me win to make a point?

18:29.709 --> 18:32.200
Let's call it a draw.

18:32.208 --> 18:34.199
Unauthoriyed voice pattern.

18:34.208 --> 18:36.199
Identify. Possible intruder.

18:36.208 --> 18:38.199
Deactivate the simulation,
Sandi.

18:38.208 --> 18:39.197
We're done for tonight.

18:39.208 --> 18:40.698
I want a rematch.

18:40.709 --> 18:42.199
Without the truck?

18:42.208 --> 18:43.197
You're on.

18:43.709 --> 18:45.199
Unauthoriyed voice pattern.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.197
Possible intruder.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.206
I said it's over, Sandi.

18:48.750 --> 18:49.739
Deactivate.

18:49.750 --> 18:50.739
Sure you're up to it?

18:50.750 --> 18:52.206
Someone once told me
that losing

18:52.208 --> 18:53.744
is, uh,
quite an emotional experience.

18:53.750 --> 18:57.197
I'll just bet
you it wasn't Sandi.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.742
How did you bypass
the number code?

19:03.208 --> 19:04.744
Sports section.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.241
Unauthoriyed voice pattern.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.241
Exterior access denied.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.241
Sandi, release
the door, please.

19:11.250 --> 19:14.242
Stage One security alert
initiated.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.241
Sandi, this is Dr. Ludlum.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.740
The game is over.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.742
All vocal override commands
inoperative.

19:22.750 --> 19:23.739
Uh, excuse me.

19:23.750 --> 19:26.241
Would you let me know
what's going on here?

19:26.250 --> 19:27.239
I don't believe this.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.241
Sandi's initiated containment...

19:29.250 --> 19:30.786
a Stage One alert.

19:30.792 --> 19:33.249
What does that mean?

19:33.250 --> 19:36.788
You have 30 minutes
until air supply is withdrawn.

19:36.792 --> 19:38.783
Does that answer
your question?

19:46.792 --> 19:48.282
Woody, come here.

19:50.792 --> 19:53.283
What's that?
What does that mean?

19:53.291 --> 19:54.280
Well, looks like

19:54.792 --> 19:55.781
we got your specialist.

19:55.792 --> 19:56.781
Only 37 minutes.

19:56.792 --> 19:58.282
I don't believe it.

19:58.291 --> 19:59.781
Colonel, we have a problem.

19:59.792 --> 20:01.792
Sandi's gone to Stage One alert.

20:01.792 --> 20:03.783
Well, how could that happen?

20:03.792 --> 20:05.828
It looks like
a program response error.

20:05.834 --> 20:08.280
Sandi doesn't know
it's a simulation anymore.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.282
She actually thinks
she's under attack.

20:10.291 --> 20:11.827
Run the override codes.

20:11.834 --> 20:12.823
I can't.

20:12.834 --> 20:14.290
She's malfunctioning.

20:14.291 --> 20:15.827
We're locked out.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.825
Well, what about
our people inside?

20:18.291 --> 20:19.827
Hey, come on, don't worry.

20:19.834 --> 20:21.825
We're fully prepared for
every emergency situation.

20:21.834 --> 20:23.825
Steven, go to EVAC ONE.

20:26.333 --> 20:28.324
"Access denied"?

20:28.333 --> 20:29.823
It's simple.

20:29.834 --> 20:32.325
All we have to do
is override the program.

20:32.834 --> 20:35.826
Um... if Sandi won't
listen to voice command,

20:35.834 --> 20:38.826
what makes you think she's
going to listen to a terminal?

20:38.834 --> 20:40.324
It's obviously
just a malfunction

20:40.834 --> 20:42.324
in one of the audio processors.

20:42.834 --> 20:45.871
User one-yero-yero-one
identified.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.867
Security clearance triple "A."

20:50.875 --> 20:51.864
That's funny...

20:51.875 --> 20:52.864
we're not getting a prompt.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.324
This isn't right.

20:58.333 --> 21:00.870
Um... I'd say look out!

21:03.333 --> 21:06.370
This system must remain on line.

21:06.375 --> 21:09.367
I am programmed
to defend STRADA.

21:09.375 --> 21:12.367
She was never programmed
to do that.

21:12.375 --> 21:14.866
Guess she doesn't
like to be touched.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.865
Oh, no.

21:23.875 --> 21:25.911
It's incredible!

21:25.917 --> 21:29.910
I did it... true
artificial intelligence!

21:29.917 --> 21:32.374
Sandi's not just executing
commands anymore.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.374
She's, she's actually thinking.
She's...

21:35.375 --> 21:36.911
She's deciding how to
defend herself.

21:37.375 --> 21:38.364
Wait a minute, hold it.

21:38.375 --> 21:39.911
You mean to tell me

21:40.375 --> 21:42.366
she's trying to think up ways
to get rid of us?

21:42.375 --> 21:43.911
It looks that way.

21:43.917 --> 21:45.407
What can you do about it?

21:45.417 --> 21:48.909
I built it.
I can fix it.

21:48.917 --> 21:51.909
I'd say our best
shot is, uh...

21:52.417 --> 21:54.908
is the mainframe terminal
in the control room.

21:54.917 --> 21:57.408
She shorts that one out
and it's good-bye memory.

21:59.417 --> 22:01.408
I don't know
what your man MacGyver did,

22:01.417 --> 22:02.406
but we'll straighten it out.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.953
EVAC ONE now initiated.

22:12.959 --> 22:14.950
Your card key is invalid.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.950
I thought this was supposed
to override everything.

22:16.959 --> 22:17.948
It was.

22:18.417 --> 22:19.953
Johnson, dismantle
the control box.

22:19.959 --> 22:21.415
See if you can set
up a manual override.

22:21.417 --> 22:22.406
Yes, sir.

22:25.458 --> 22:27.449
We'll just bypass

22:27.458 --> 22:28.948
this level of security.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.449
We'll be inside in five minutes.

22:41.458 --> 22:42.948
Is he all right?

22:44.458 --> 22:45.447
Can you get up?

22:46.001 --> 22:46.990
Yeah, I...

22:47.001 --> 22:49.447
Here you go.

22:49.458 --> 22:50.994
Get him over to the infirmary
right away.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.447
I don't believe it.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.994
She's programming
her own responses.

22:54.001 --> 22:55.457
You mean to tell me
that the computer did that?

22:56.001 --> 22:57.457
We're lucky
it was just an electric shock.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.449
You can bet next time
she'll shoot to kill.

22:59.458 --> 23:01.995
Which means we just used up
our one free turn.

23:02.001 --> 23:04.993
And MacGyver's.

23:05.001 --> 23:06.992
Steven, round up
your design team on the double.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.489
We'll go to EVAC TWO.

23:08.500 --> 23:09.990
Wait. There's a power substation
at Twin Pines.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.489
What if we shut it down?

23:11.500 --> 23:12.489
Reserve generators

23:12.500 --> 23:14.991
will just kick in.
No, they won't.

23:15.001 --> 23:15.990
What are you talking about?

23:16.001 --> 23:16.990
The control program's
in place,

23:17.500 --> 23:18.489
but I haven't
activated it yet.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.990
I was going
to do that tomorrow.

23:20.001 --> 23:21.992
Look, by my count,
we've got 20 minutes left.

23:22.001 --> 23:22.990
What are we waiting for?

23:23.001 --> 23:24.992
Twin Pines supplies the power

23:25.000 --> 23:26.991
to the only hospital
within 100 miles.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.490
Besides, I'm not going
to risk the lives

23:28.500 --> 23:29.990
of those two people in there

23:30.000 --> 23:31.490
on some unproven procedure,

23:31.500 --> 23:32.990
especially since EVAC TWO
has been successfully tested

23:33.500 --> 23:34.489
against every emergency
in the book.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.990
Woody, for crying out loud,

23:36.000 --> 23:37.991
you've got a computer in there
that's writing its own book!

23:38.000 --> 23:39.490
Come on, Pete, it's a machine.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.537
Looks like we'll have to find

23:49.542 --> 23:51.533
another way to
Sandi's control room.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.536
Wait, I have a card.

23:57.542 --> 24:00.534
Reject. Card invalid.

24:00.542 --> 24:01.998
30,000 watts
of laser protection,

24:02.542 --> 24:03.998
and no way to turn it off.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.036
Uh-huh

24:06.041 --> 24:08.032
Let me see that.

24:12.041 --> 24:14.032
Yeah.

24:14.041 --> 24:15.531
Works good.

24:15.542 --> 24:18.534
Listen, I thought you said
you could fix everything.

24:18.542 --> 24:22.034
I said I could fix everything
from the control room.

24:22.041 --> 24:24.532
I didn't say anything
about getting there.

24:24.542 --> 24:27.033
Yeah.

24:27.041 --> 24:29.032
Is there a ladies' room around?

24:29.583 --> 24:31.039
A ladies' room?

24:34.583 --> 24:36.574
What're you doing in there?

24:38.041 --> 24:39.030
A mirror?

24:39.041 --> 24:40.577
Oh, come on, MacGyver.

24:40.583 --> 24:43.040
Well, I figure
if I hit it at the right angle,

24:43.041 --> 24:45.578
I can blow out both lasers
at the same time.

24:45.583 --> 24:48.074
They'll burn through
that in a half a second.

24:48.083 --> 24:50.074
I'll buy you a new one.

24:54.083 --> 24:55.573
Yeah, that's good.

24:55.583 --> 24:57.574
Let's go.

25:08.083 --> 25:09.072
All right, here we go.

25:09.083 --> 25:11.074
Watch yourself.

25:44.625 --> 25:45.660
You were right.

25:45.667 --> 25:47.658
So were you.

25:47.667 --> 25:49.123
Warning!

25:49.125 --> 25:52.663
Do not proceed
through inner core.

25:55.125 --> 25:56.661
Now would you be
willing to admit

25:56.667 --> 25:59.124
there's something wrong
with your program?

25:59.125 --> 26:02.117
Maybe...

26:05.166 --> 26:06.656
Let's go!

26:06.667 --> 26:10.159
The system
is programmed to defend.

26:10.166 --> 26:13.658
You have entered the inner core
without clearance.

26:13.667 --> 26:17.660
Containment procedures
are in effect.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.157
Come here!

26:35.709 --> 26:37.700
This was a bad idea.

26:37.709 --> 26:39.165
Why is that?

26:39.166 --> 26:42.704
Excess waste is automatically
dumped into an acid bath.

26:42.709 --> 26:43.698
How much do you weigh?

26:43.709 --> 26:44.698
One seventy-five.

26:44.709 --> 26:46.700
This is programmed to 280.

26:46.709 --> 26:50.201
So if you weigh more than,
uh, 105...

26:50.208 --> 26:51.698
we're in trouble.

26:51.709 --> 26:53.199
I think we're okay.

26:56.208 --> 26:58.199
I lied!

26:58.208 --> 27:00.199
A hundred and eight.

27:01.709 --> 27:05.748
Intruders must be eliminated.

27:12.750 --> 27:15.207
It's not going to work!

27:21.208 --> 27:23.199
Why are you taking your pants off?

27:23.208 --> 27:24.744
You got a better idea?

27:24.750 --> 27:26.240
I'm still trying
to figure out

27:26.250 --> 27:28.241
what yours is.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.741
Come here. Grab this.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.240
Oh!

27:39.750 --> 27:41.741
How strong are your pants?

27:43.250 --> 27:44.740
Stronger than your pipe.

27:45.250 --> 27:45.784
Ah...

27:56.625 --> 27:58.616
Hand over hand, all right?

28:04.625 --> 28:05.614
Oh!

28:12.125 --> 28:14.116
All right.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.116
Hang on!

28:16.125 --> 28:18.116
Oh...

28:18.125 --> 28:20.616
Oh!

28:20.625 --> 28:22.616
Oh, I can't!

28:28.625 --> 28:30.115
You all right?

28:30.125 --> 28:31.114
Yeah.

28:31.125 --> 28:33.116
Hang in there.

28:33.125 --> 28:34.114
Oh!

28:38.125 --> 28:41.117
Oh, hurry!

28:41.125 --> 28:43.116
Yeah!

28:45.667 --> 28:48.124
Here we go.

28:56.166 --> 28:57.155
Are you okay?

28:57.667 --> 28:58.656
Yeah.

29:00.166 --> 29:02.157
Oh...

29:07.667 --> 29:11.159
Oh... I'm okay.

29:15.709 --> 29:17.700
Twin Pines power station
confirms.

29:17.709 --> 29:19.165
They're ready to shut down
when we are.

29:19.709 --> 29:20.164
Good.

29:20.709 --> 29:21.164
Do it!

29:21.166 --> 29:22.155
We'll do it when we get

29:22.709 --> 29:24.165
the go-ahead
from General Braddock.

29:24.166 --> 29:25.702
General Braddock doesn't know
what's going on in there.

29:26.166 --> 29:27.155
We do.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.157
There's a whole town
out in that valley,

29:29.166 --> 29:31.157
and we do not black it out
unless we have

29:31.166 --> 29:32.702
an official state
of emergency.

29:32.709 --> 29:34.199
Official!

29:34.208 --> 29:36.699
Woody, two people
are going to die out here

29:36.709 --> 29:38.199
if we don't do something!

29:38.709 --> 29:40.700
Now, how much more official
do you want to get?

29:41.208 --> 29:42.698
This is just like 'Nam, Pete.

29:42.709 --> 29:44.199
We don't do anything
until I give the orders.

29:48.709 --> 29:52.201
Well, ol' Sandi sure has
a mind of her own, doesn't she?

29:52.208 --> 29:55.200
Yes, but she thinks like me,

29:55.750 --> 29:57.206
so I should be able to
think it through

29:57.208 --> 30:00.200
and find her pattern,
logically and rationally.

30:00.208 --> 30:02.745
Without the emotion,
right?

30:03.208 --> 30:04.750
That's what gives her the edge.

30:04.750 --> 30:07.742
People and emotion
can't get in her way.

30:07.750 --> 30:11.197
Look... I say we trust
our instincts,

30:11.208 --> 30:12.243
go with our gut.

30:12.250 --> 30:14.241
You can't program that.

30:14.250 --> 30:16.241
That's our edge.

30:16.250 --> 30:18.741
A power disruption
has been detected.

30:19.250 --> 30:23.243
The system must remain on line
during a Stage One alert.

30:23.250 --> 30:24.239
Pete, you old son-of-a-gun,

30:24.750 --> 30:26.240
I knew you were out
there somewhere!

30:26.250 --> 30:27.239
How do you know it's him?

30:27.750 --> 30:28.739
Because I got a feeling.

30:28.750 --> 30:31.241
Is the hospital
on emergency power?

30:31.250 --> 30:33.241
Good.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.786
I owe you one.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.241
Sandi's trying to kick
in the reserve generator.

30:37.250 --> 30:39.787
Reserve power must be initiated.

30:40.250 --> 30:41.786
The system must remain on line.

30:46.792 --> 30:47.781
Yeah!

30:47.792 --> 30:48.781
The whole mountain's out.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.286
The power's out.

30:53.291 --> 30:54.781
We're on emergency battery lights.

30:55.291 --> 30:56.280
Time to go home.

30:56.291 --> 30:58.782
Sandi, we got you now.

30:59.792 --> 31:02.283
Looks like you got lucky.

31:13.291 --> 31:17.830
Reserve power must be initiated.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.280
All right, let's get those people
out of the mountain.

31:20.291 --> 31:21.827
Here, take it.
Let's go, let's go!

31:21.834 --> 31:23.290
Let's get it
on the other side.

31:23.291 --> 31:24.827
You need to go with...

31:24.834 --> 31:25.823
All right.

31:27.291 --> 31:29.282
Now, what the hell is that?

31:33.333 --> 31:34.823
She's coming back on!

31:34.834 --> 31:36.324
No, no, it's just
a surplus charge.

31:36.333 --> 31:40.834
It can't last more than a minute.

31:40.834 --> 31:42.324
Incredible!

31:42.333 --> 31:43.823
Sandi's searching her memory

31:44.333 --> 31:46.324
for the control command
to activate the generators.

31:46.333 --> 31:51.327
Control command activated.
Control command activated.

31:51.333 --> 31:53.324
Damn it! She's found it!

31:53.333 --> 31:54.869
It's impossible,

31:54.875 --> 31:56.331
but she's turning on
the generators herself.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.324
Shutdown has been circumvented.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.869
Shutdown has been circumvented.

31:59.875 --> 32:01.331
What do we do now?

32:01.333 --> 32:04.871
Start depending
on one another, I guess.

32:13.375 --> 32:14.865
Whoops!

32:14.875 --> 32:16.365
One of your
little friends.

32:16.375 --> 32:17.364
We'll never outrun it.

32:17.875 --> 32:21.367
Aw, come on, where's
your sense of adventure?

32:57.917 --> 32:58.906
What are you doing?

32:58.917 --> 33:00.407
Taking out the magnet.

33:00.917 --> 33:01.406
What for?

33:05.917 --> 33:07.908
Can you get that other one?

33:14.417 --> 33:16.954
I take it you have a game plan.

33:16.959 --> 33:17.948
More or less.

33:24.959 --> 33:26.950
Would you mind explaining
what's going on?

33:26.959 --> 33:28.415
Yeah, in a minute,
but I need paper.

33:28.417 --> 33:29.953
Get me some paper.

33:34.458 --> 33:35.948
Yeah, that'll do it.

33:35.959 --> 33:37.449
Do what?

33:37.959 --> 33:40.450
The drones yero in
on heat, right?

33:40.458 --> 33:44.451
So we light these up, and
they'll yero in on each other.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.449
Brilliant!

33:47.458 --> 33:48.948
All right, I need matches.

33:48.959 --> 33:50.449
On the counter
behind the test tubes.

33:50.959 --> 33:51.948
Great!

33:56.001 --> 34:00.449
Intruders must be eliminated.

34:00.458 --> 34:02.995
Intruders must be eliminated.

34:05.458 --> 34:05.992
Look out!

34:10.458 --> 34:12.494
I still need matches.

34:14.500 --> 34:15.000
Over there.

34:23.001 --> 34:25.993
Intruders must be eliminated.

34:35.000 --> 34:35.989
Hurry!

34:37.500 --> 34:38.989
Oh!

34:49.500 --> 34:53.994
Intruders must be eliminated.

35:00.542 --> 35:01.998
Go!

35:14.542 --> 35:16.533
Three down, one to go.

35:19.041 --> 35:20.030
Come on.

35:33.041 --> 35:35.032
One to go, remember?

35:35.041 --> 35:37.032
It's leaving.

35:37.041 --> 35:38.577
Sandi's calling it back.

35:38.583 --> 35:41.040
Stage Two has commenced.

35:41.041 --> 35:43.032
Eliminate all oxygen.

35:43.041 --> 35:45.578
Reduce environment to vacuum.

35:45.583 --> 35:47.574
Final countdown commencing.

35:47.583 --> 35:50.040
She's taking this
kind of personally, isn't she?

35:50.041 --> 35:53.579
We've got 12 minutes of
oxygen left.

36:03.083 --> 36:05.574
The drone's gone.

36:05.583 --> 36:07.574
Makes sense.

36:07.583 --> 36:10.575
Sandi sent it to the control room.

36:10.583 --> 36:14.075
So even if we go
through this door,

36:14.083 --> 36:15.619
it's gonna be
waiting for us, huh?

36:15.625 --> 36:16.614
That's right.

36:16.625 --> 36:19.082
And that shoots down
our only chance

36:19.083 --> 36:21.620
to override Sandi's program.

36:22.083 --> 36:23.072
Are you sure?

36:23.625 --> 36:25.616
Of course I'm sure.

36:25.625 --> 36:29.618
Ten minutes of oxygen remaining.
Thank you.

36:29.625 --> 36:33.117
I got an idea.

36:33.125 --> 36:35.116
Sandi thinks like you, right?

36:35.125 --> 36:36.114
Right.

36:36.125 --> 36:38.616
Well, if you're sure
that our only chance

36:38.625 --> 36:40.115
is to get to the main frame,

36:40.125 --> 36:44.118
so does she.

36:44.125 --> 36:46.116
But it is our only chance.

36:49.125 --> 36:51.616
There might be another one.

36:58.667 --> 37:00.658
Through the ventilation system!

37:00.667 --> 37:04.114
Right to the oxygen outlet
and the exhaust fans.

37:04.125 --> 37:07.663
Woody, these bypass codes
are never gonna get us

37:07.667 --> 37:09.123
through the front door.

37:09.125 --> 37:10.661
MacGyver's got to know
that by now, too.

37:10.667 --> 37:12.658
I'm sure he's looking
for some other way out.

37:13.166 --> 37:14.656
Pete, you can't be
sure of anything.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.155
If you're right, Mr. Thornton,

37:16.166 --> 37:19.158
MacGyver only has two
choices for another way out.

37:19.166 --> 37:21.657
The maintenance shaft
or the exhaust outlet.

37:21.667 --> 37:22.656
Well, now we're
getting somewhere.

37:22.667 --> 37:23.656
There's a catch.

37:23.667 --> 37:25.658
Both of them are mined
with explosives

37:25.667 --> 37:27.157
from the outside
access ports.

37:27.166 --> 37:28.656
We only have time
to dismantle one.

37:28.667 --> 37:30.658
Mined?

37:30.667 --> 37:32.703
So you're telling me
if Mac tries to exit

37:32.709 --> 37:34.700
either way before we
diffuse the explosives...

37:34.709 --> 37:36.165
He's gonna blow
both of them to kingdom come.

37:40.166 --> 37:44.705
Seven minutes
of oxygen remaining.

37:44.709 --> 37:45.698
Thank you.

37:47.709 --> 37:49.700
Vacuum pumps operative.

37:49.709 --> 37:53.201
Oxygen being withdrawn
by outlet fan.

37:53.709 --> 37:57.702
Six minutes
of oxygen remaining.

38:01.709 --> 38:05.201
Where is the power cable?

38:05.208 --> 38:06.197
Over there.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.206
If we can cut the power
to the fan,

38:14.208 --> 38:16.745
she can't take all the air out.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.206
Warning!

38:19.208 --> 38:22.746
The exhaust outlet
is not an authoriyed exit!

38:34.250 --> 38:35.239
It worked.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.741
The fan stopped.

38:37.750 --> 38:38.739
Sandi's locking the complex!

38:41.750 --> 38:43.741
The door's air tight.

38:53.250 --> 38:54.239
I'm sorry, Colonel,

38:54.250 --> 38:56.241
but Sandi's overriding
all EVAC commands.

38:56.792 --> 38:58.248
Run the displacement codes.

38:58.250 --> 38:59.786
I did... twice.

38:59.792 --> 39:02.784
There are still those
two possibilities.

39:02.792 --> 39:05.249
The maintenance shaft
and the exhaust outlet.

39:05.250 --> 39:07.787
We can't roll the dice
on something like this.

39:07.792 --> 39:08.781
Look, we don't roll the dice.

39:09.250 --> 39:11.241
We make a calculated choice.

39:11.250 --> 39:13.787
It's time we tried
to think like MacGyver.

39:13.792 --> 39:16.784
His mind doesn't work
like yours or mine.

39:16.792 --> 39:18.783
We've gotta put
our gut to work, Woody.

39:18.792 --> 39:20.282
Instinct doesn't cut it, Pete.

39:20.291 --> 39:21.280
We've got plans.

39:21.291 --> 39:22.280
They have been thought out.

39:22.291 --> 39:23.781
They have been reviewed.
They've been approved.

39:23.792 --> 39:26.283
Some of the finest military
minds in this country have...

39:26.291 --> 39:28.782
We lost three
good men in 'Nam

39:28.792 --> 39:29.781
because those military minds

39:29.792 --> 39:32.829
were sitting behind
some desk 300 miles away.

39:32.834 --> 39:35.826
I was under orders
to spot enemy troop movement.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.827
Now, what the hell
did you want me to do?

39:37.834 --> 39:40.280
We didn't have
to be so close!

39:40.291 --> 39:41.280
We were there, Woody.

39:41.291 --> 39:42.280
We knew what to do.

39:42.291 --> 39:43.827
Headquarters didn't!

39:43.834 --> 39:44.823
And we're here now!

39:45.291 --> 39:46.827
It's our decision.

39:46.834 --> 39:50.827
These are our friends.

39:50.834 --> 39:55.828
Four minutes of oxygen left.

39:55.834 --> 39:57.825
Colonel?

39:57.834 --> 40:00.826
Woody?

40:01.333 --> 40:04.825
All right, all right.

40:04.834 --> 40:07.325
You know MacGyver best.

40:07.333 --> 40:08.823
It's your call, Pete.

40:12.875 --> 40:14.331
What about that wheel?

40:14.333 --> 40:16.870
Will it manually
override the door?

40:16.875 --> 40:18.331
Yes,

40:18.333 --> 40:19.869
but the whole exhaust outlet

40:19.875 --> 40:22.867
is mined
from the outside.

40:23.333 --> 40:26.871
You can't open that door
unless someone outside

40:26.875 --> 40:31.869
dismantles the
explosives first.

40:31.875 --> 40:35.868
Well, then we gotta get
back to the main entrance.

40:35.875 --> 40:40.869
We'll never get anywhere
while Sandi's still on line.

40:45.875 --> 40:48.366
What about
that control box?

40:48.375 --> 40:50.366
Does that run
to the computer?

40:50.375 --> 40:53.367
Yeah...

40:53.375 --> 40:58.369
holds the control wires.

40:58.375 --> 41:06.373
Well, then if we,
uh, overload the wires...

41:06.375 --> 41:10.368
We override the program.

41:10.917 --> 41:14.409
Yeah, that's the idea.

41:21.917 --> 41:24.408
Where are you gonna
get the electricity?

41:24.917 --> 41:27.408
Two minutes
of oxygen remaining.

41:27.417 --> 41:28.406
Thank you.

41:52.959 --> 41:56.451
90 seconds of oxygen remaining.
Thank you.

42:13.458 --> 42:15.995
It's gonna be
kind of a stretch.

42:19.001 --> 42:21.447
Interference forbidden!
Increase power!

42:22.458 --> 42:23.447
Look out!

42:23.458 --> 42:25.449
She supercharged the cable!

42:28.458 --> 42:29.994
All right, that's it!

42:42.500 --> 42:43.990
Overload. Overload.

42:44.001 --> 42:45.491
Intruders must be...

42:46.001 --> 42:46.490
Defend...

42:47.001 --> 42:47.490
defend.

42:48.001 --> 42:49.491
Intruders interfend...

42:49.500 --> 42:50.990
intrude...

42:51.001 --> 42:52.491
intrude system

42:52.500 --> 42:52.989
defend... defend...

43:06.000 --> 43:06.989
Come on.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.490
Gotta get you
to the main entrance.

43:08.500 --> 43:11.992
Let's go. Come on.

43:17.542 --> 43:19.533
Oh, I can't.

43:19.542 --> 43:21.533
I can't.

43:21.542 --> 43:25.990
Come back,
come back for me.

43:31.000 --> 43:31.989
Not enough air.

43:40.041 --> 43:43.533
Come on, Pete, be there.

43:43.542 --> 43:45.533
No, MacGyver!
It's mined!

43:45.542 --> 43:47.032
If it's not disarmed,

43:47.542 --> 43:50.033
it'll explode!

43:50.041 --> 43:51.531
I got a feelin',

43:51.542 --> 43:54.579
I got a feelin'...

44:07.583 --> 44:08.572
They're in there!

44:08.583 --> 44:09.572
They're alive!

44:09.583 --> 44:12.040
Get the oxygen equipment
in there on the double!

44:12.041 --> 44:14.578
MacGyver, are you all right?

44:14.583 --> 44:17.074
Never felt better, Pete.

44:17.083 --> 44:19.074
Looks like we guessed right.

44:19.083 --> 44:20.573
Thought you might
be hanging around.

44:47.083 --> 44:49.620
You know, I'm almost sorry
we had to short her out.

44:50.083 --> 44:53.120
We were on the verge of a major
scientific breakthrough.

44:53.125 --> 44:55.616
It's gonna take
me a while to get

44:55.625 --> 44:57.616
the kinks out of the system.

44:58.125 --> 45:02.619
Well, just don't take the people
out of the system, all right?

45:02.625 --> 45:06.117
Well, they are unreliable

45:06.125 --> 45:09.617
and they're definitely
irrational.

45:09.625 --> 45:12.617
But I guess we do need them.

45:14.125 --> 45:16.116
Thanks, Mac.

45:20.125 --> 45:22.116
You're all right
for a camel smuggler.

45:22.125 --> 45:24.116
I returned that camel.

45:25.667 --> 45:28.124
Pete, it was good
seeing you. Real good.

45:28.125 --> 45:29.114
If you ever get tired

45:29.667 --> 45:31.123
of the easy life, you, uh...

45:31.125 --> 45:32.661
Oh-ho-ho, not a chance.

45:33.166 --> 45:36.158
Pete, what made you so sure we'd
choose the exhaust system?

45:36.667 --> 45:39.158
You only had a 50 percent chance
of being correct.

45:39.166 --> 45:41.657
Well, actually I
remembered that Mac had used

45:41.667 --> 45:43.658
an exhaust system
to get out of a big fire

45:43.667 --> 45:45.658
at Brookhurst Chemical last year

45:45.667 --> 45:47.658
and I figured
he'd remember, too.

45:47.667 --> 45:49.157
Take care of yourself, Woody.

45:53.166 --> 45:54.155
Bye, Pete, thanks.

45:54.709 --> 45:59.703
It was the elevator shaft.

46:00.166 --> 46:02.703
What elevator?

46:02.709 --> 46:05.155
The fire at
Brookhurst Chemical.

46:05.166 --> 46:07.703
I used the elevator shaft,
not the exhaust system.

46:09.166 --> 46:10.155
No...

46:10.166 --> 46:11.702
Yep.

46:16.709 --> 46:18.700
It couldn't be.

46:22.709 --> 46:25.701
It was.
