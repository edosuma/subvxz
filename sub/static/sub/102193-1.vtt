M_I_SForEver

00:45.878 --> 00:47.447
Okay, go for it.

00:48.347 --> 00:49.215
Are you sure?

00:50.448 --> 00:52.350
Yeah.

00:52.384 --> 00:53.520
Okay.

00:59.792 --> 01:01.294
Holy shit.

01:01.326 --> 01:02.829
That actually worked.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.251
Puller to Dispatch.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.685
Go ahead, Puller.

01:59.718 --> 02:01.254
Hey, I'm out at
the Mathew's place.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.156
I thought I was
backing up Gallagher.

02:03.188 --> 02:04.789
He got held
up on by the train on CR1.

02:04.822 --> 02:06.558
He's en route,
should be there soon.

02:06.591 --> 02:08.461
Oh, great.

02:08.493 --> 02:11.296
I thought there was some kind
of noise complaint out here.

02:11.330 --> 02:13.432
The neighbors
reported yelling.

02:13.465 --> 02:15.602
Yeah, well, damn,
it's quiet as hell now.

02:18.537 --> 02:20.907
All right, 10-4. I'm
gonna check it out.

02:20.939 --> 02:21.875
Copy.

02:25.276 --> 02:26.378
Sheriff's department!

02:30.515 --> 02:31.884
Ma'am, are you all right?!

02:33.786 --> 02:35.555
Have
you seen my knife?

02:35.587 --> 02:38.424
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
you to drop that knife.

03:14.627 --> 03:15.495
Sir.

03:20.498 --> 03:22.467
Sir, I'm gonna
need you to get up.

03:24.502 --> 03:25.370
Sir!

03:27.306 --> 03:28.841
Puller to Dispatch.

03:28.873 --> 03:29.741
Copy, Puller.

03:31.342 --> 03:32.444
Hey, I'm gonna need
an ambulance out here

03:32.478 --> 03:33.579
at the Mathew's place, pronto.

03:33.611 --> 03:35.881
Shots fired, one unconscious,

03:35.913 --> 03:40.518
male, maybe mid-20s.

03:40.551 --> 03:42.354
And where in the
hell's my backup?!

03:43.421 --> 03:44.856
Copy, Puller.

03:44.889 --> 03:46.391
Backup is on the way.

03:46.425 --> 03:47.527
Ambulance is en route.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.329
Copy that.

03:52.965 --> 03:54.400
What in the hell?

04:16.088 --> 04:17.656
Oh, way to go, Gallagher!

04:17.689 --> 04:19.959
How am I gonna
question him now?!

04:19.992 --> 04:21.560
You're welcome.

04:21.593 --> 04:24.463
Ah, shit.

04:26.865 --> 04:28.867
What the fuck, Vera?

04:28.901 --> 04:30.002
What?!

04:30.035 --> 04:31.637
You shouldn't have stopped me.

04:31.670 --> 04:32.638
Are you kidding me?
You were gonna kill him.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.740
So what if I did?

04:34.773 --> 04:36.309
Seriously?!

04:36.341 --> 04:37.709
We have these powers.

04:37.742 --> 04:39.577
Why don't we use
them for some good?

04:39.610 --> 04:41.079
Killing people
isn't good, Vera!

04:41.112 --> 04:42.947
Who says?

04:42.980 --> 04:45.951
Did you ever think that
maybe some people deserve it,

04:45.983 --> 04:47.819
maybe that's why we
got these powers?

04:47.853 --> 04:49.689
Vera, listen to yourself.

04:49.721 --> 04:53.358
I mean, Jesus Christ,
we are not superheroes!

04:58.463 --> 04:59.331
Look...

05:01.699 --> 05:02.767
I got to to take this, Vera.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.103
Fucking course.

05:41.906 --> 05:42.774
Hello?

05:46.812 --> 05:49.782
Look, I know that you're there.

05:55.019 --> 05:59.724
Look, I'm not sure how,
but I know you're in there

05:59.757 --> 06:02.461
and I just want to talk to you.

06:05.197 --> 06:06.399
How'd you find me?

06:11.437 --> 06:13.038
I'm not sure, I just...

06:13.071 --> 06:15.375
Look, can you just
open the door, please?

06:36.995 --> 06:38.864
I can't believe
it's actually you.

06:38.896 --> 06:40.500
I thought I was going crazy.

06:41.699 --> 06:43.468
How'd you find me?

06:43.502 --> 06:45.037
I don't know, I just-

06:45.069 --> 06:47.772
- You just knew I was here?

06:47.805 --> 06:51.209
Exactly, but I
kinda got the feeling

06:51.242 --> 06:52.911
you knew I was coming.

06:52.944 --> 06:53.812
Right?

06:55.848 --> 06:57.783
I might have thought
you were coming.

06:57.815 --> 06:59.784
Exactly, it was kinda like

06:59.817 --> 07:01.486
you just felt
where I was, right?

07:01.519 --> 07:02.854
I mean, me too.

07:02.887 --> 07:05.024
It's crazy and I thought
I was going nuts,

07:05.057 --> 07:07.593
but, like, every
single time I tried,

07:07.625 --> 07:10.162
I just kinda knew
where to find you.

07:11.762 --> 07:12.864
You felt the same
thing too, right?

07:12.898 --> 07:14.667
Like, you felt me coming here?

07:16.668 --> 07:18.069
Look...

07:18.103 --> 07:19.071
This is crazy.

07:19.103 --> 07:20.973
Look, no, I know.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.842
And look, no judgment from me,
I have to know if I'm right.

07:23.875 --> 07:25.877
I'm going crazy
here. I need to know.

07:25.911 --> 07:28.480
You felt me coming here, right?

07:28.514 --> 07:29.182
Yeah.

07:31.649 --> 07:34.052
I just sort of knew
where you were.

07:37.788 --> 07:39.724
It's like I could
feel where you were,

07:41.059 --> 07:42.995
or more a general
direction you were in.

07:43.028 --> 07:46.564
Exactly, but, like,
how does that even work?

07:46.598 --> 07:48.201
And what was that
thing last night?

07:49.233 --> 07:50.101
I don't know.

07:51.670 --> 07:52.872
How much do you remember?

07:54.139 --> 07:55.040
Not a lot.

07:56.975 --> 08:01.914
Let's see, I remember
driving and then that light,

08:01.947 --> 08:03.848
and it sorta called
to me, you know?

08:03.882 --> 08:07.052
And then I remember you and
we kinda walked towards it,

08:07.084 --> 08:08.786
and then it kinda blew up

08:08.819 --> 08:11.824
or it was more like
it pushed me away.

08:11.857 --> 08:13.259
And then the next thing I know,

08:13.291 --> 08:14.959
I woke up and it
was this morning.

08:14.992 --> 08:16.094
Right.

08:16.127 --> 08:17.729
What time did you wake up?

08:17.762 --> 08:19.531
I don't know. My
cellphone was dead.

08:19.564 --> 08:20.500
Mine too.

08:21.867 --> 08:25.004
But when I woke up,
you weren't there.

08:26.004 --> 08:26.771
No one was there.

08:28.339 --> 08:29.707
Well, I mean,
I was only, like,

08:29.740 --> 08:32.010
10 feet from whatever it was.

08:32.043 --> 08:33.711
I mean, you would have
had to have seen me.

08:33.745 --> 08:36.081
No, I was right
where it was too.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.951
I mean, I looked around
for you or anyone,

08:39.985 --> 08:43.121
but I swear you weren't there.

08:44.990 --> 08:46.993
I mean, I didn't
just disappear.

08:54.666 --> 08:55.868
There's something else.

09:12.850 --> 09:13.719
Good lord.

09:15.620 --> 09:18.823
Could you get me a
bigger evidence bag?

09:28.265 --> 09:31.069
You get that evidence
down to holding yet?

09:31.102 --> 09:32.203
I just got it.

09:32.236 --> 09:33.706
I'm gonna go over it first.

09:35.173 --> 09:37.241
That means I
don't have to do it.

09:37.274 --> 09:38.843
I'm heading home.

09:38.876 --> 09:42.146
Let me know what
you find, tomorrow.

09:42.179 --> 09:44.015
Yeah, right.

09:44.048 --> 09:45.183
Go for it.

09:45.216 --> 09:46.085
Are you sure?

09:47.653 --> 09:49.355
Yeah.

09:49.388 --> 09:50.756
Okay.

09:51.923 --> 09:53.692
How the hell did you do that?

09:53.725 --> 09:54.594
I don't know.

09:55.927 --> 09:57.796
So, okay, this other
person I tried,

09:57.828 --> 10:02.999
I mean, I just concentrate
on them and they passed out.

10:03.168 --> 10:04.703
You're sure she's not dead?

10:08.240 --> 10:09.108
Um.

10:10.274 --> 10:12.644
Um, I don't think so.

10:12.677 --> 10:15.047
I mean, the first
person I did that to,

10:15.080 --> 10:17.650
they passed out and just
woke up a few minutes later.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.319
How is that even possible?

10:20.351 --> 10:22.087
I mean, like, how
does that even work?

10:26.124 --> 10:27.093
You should try.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.662
I should try what?

10:32.431 --> 10:35.734
Wait, you mean putting someone
to sleep by staring at them?

10:35.767 --> 10:37.703
Yeah, I can't do that.

10:37.735 --> 10:39.337
How do you know?

10:39.370 --> 10:42.073
Look, I didn't know I
could do it until I did it.

10:42.106 --> 10:44.275
And we both had the
same thing happen to us.

10:45.443 --> 10:47.045
You should try.

10:47.078 --> 10:48.980
There is no way
that I can do that.

10:51.182 --> 10:52.317
Okay, fine.

10:57.722 --> 10:58.890
Try it on him.

10:58.923 --> 11:00.091
Vera,
I can't do that.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.361
Okay, if it works
for me and not for you,

11:03.394 --> 11:04.864
then at least we know
a little more, right?

11:11.302 --> 11:12.672
I guess, yeah.

11:13.938 --> 11:15.073
Okay.

11:15.106 --> 11:17.275
So get up.

11:20.111 --> 11:20.980
All right.

11:22.313 --> 11:26.784
So just look at him
and concentrate on him.

11:26.817 --> 11:29.054
"Concentrate on him." Okay.

11:35.860 --> 11:36.961
Yeah, it doesn't
seem to be working.

11:36.995 --> 11:37.962
Okay, okay.

11:37.995 --> 11:40.231
So take a deep breath

11:42.000 --> 11:43.101
and give it a second.

11:45.003 --> 11:48.741
Really, really
concentrate on him.

11:50.241 --> 11:55.014
Kind of like you're
wondering what he's thinking.

11:56.114 --> 11:56.982
Okay.

12:05.157 --> 12:08.828
Jesus Christ.

12:12.964 --> 12:13.933
That worked.

12:18.135 --> 12:21.005
Okay, so what does this mean?

12:21.038 --> 12:22.441
I mean, has to be something
changed done to us

12:22.474 --> 12:24.210
by whatever that
thing was, right?

12:27.379 --> 12:28.247
I don't know.

12:32.384 --> 12:33.985
Maybe we're dreaming.

12:34.019 --> 12:37.855
You know, like in a
coma or something?

12:37.889 --> 12:39.490
I mean, I don't feel
like I'm in a coma.

12:39.524 --> 12:41.225
It's more likely that thing
was, like, radioactive

12:41.259 --> 12:43.195
and gave us brain
cancer or something.

12:44.428 --> 12:46.398
Look, I can't be sure of that.

12:50.034 --> 12:52.103
Well, maybe we
should see a doctor?

12:52.136 --> 12:53.838
Oh, no, now that's a bad idea.

12:53.871 --> 12:55.274
Have you ever seen
a movie before?

12:55.307 --> 12:57.042
Look, if they find
out what we can do,

12:57.075 --> 12:58.811
we're gonna be on some
table being dissected

12:58.844 --> 13:00.212
or something and...

13:00.245 --> 13:02.047
Look, we don't even
know what we can do yet,

13:02.080 --> 13:05.350
so let's just not tell
anybody anything yet, okay?

13:09.321 --> 13:10.189
You're right.

13:14.491 --> 13:17.261
Look, we do need to do some

13:17.294 --> 13:20.198
more tests though,
but carefully.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.370
What kind of tests?

13:30.942 --> 13:31.911
Okay, get up.

13:34.211 --> 13:35.080
Stand up.

13:36.648 --> 13:37.516
Do it to me.

13:39.618 --> 13:42.187
Do what exactly?

13:42.220 --> 13:44.056
The thing. Try
to put me to sleep.

13:44.923 --> 13:46.557
Are you sure?

13:46.591 --> 13:48.494
Look, we need to know if
it affects each other, right?

13:51.495 --> 13:52.364
Okay.

13:58.302 --> 13:59.138
Okay.

14:00.038 --> 14:01.039
- Ready?
- Yeah.

14:05.910 --> 14:07.011
- Wait!
- What?!

14:07.044 --> 14:07.913
Hold on.

14:12.951 --> 14:14.219
Wow.

14:14.251 --> 14:15.152
- Good call.
- Better.

14:15.186 --> 14:16.055
Yeah.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.033
Okay, go for it.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.310
It's not working.

14:38.342 --> 14:39.510
Yeah, I don't feel
anything at all.

14:40.678 --> 14:41.547
Hmm.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.349
Okay, try me.

14:45.383 --> 14:46.252
Okay.

14:49.687 --> 14:50.556
Okay.

14:52.557 --> 14:53.425
You ready?

15:04.168 --> 15:07.139
Okay, so this isn't
working at all.

15:07.172 --> 15:10.276
So we're, like,
immune to each other?

15:11.475 --> 15:13.345
I guess. I don't really know.

15:13.378 --> 15:15.413
I mean, it's probably related
to whatever that feeling is

15:15.447 --> 15:18.015
that brought me to you, maybe?

15:18.048 --> 15:19.384
This is so weird.

15:19.417 --> 15:20.286
Yeah.

15:21.619 --> 15:24.923
Actually, I'm feeling
a little tired too.

15:26.758 --> 15:28.326
Me too, actually.

15:31.395 --> 15:33.531
Maybe using it takes
a lot of energy?

15:36.634 --> 15:40.272
Maybe we should get
some rest, call it a day?

15:42.106 --> 15:43.675
Okay, look, I'm gonna
take the floor, all right?

15:48.513 --> 15:51.416
Hello. No one is
available to take your call.

15:51.448 --> 15:53.418
Please leave a message
after the tone.

15:54.418 --> 15:57.088
Hey, it's me.

15:57.121 --> 16:00.358
Look, I was on my way
to see you, I swear.

16:00.392 --> 16:02.260
I just...

16:02.293 --> 16:04.663
Look, I didn't want to worry
you, but I was in an accident.

16:04.696 --> 16:08.700
And I'm fine, mostly.

16:08.732 --> 16:10.368
Look, anyways, I swear,
I'm gonna be heading

16:10.402 --> 16:11.703
your way soon, okay?

16:11.735 --> 16:13.337
I just...

16:13.370 --> 16:15.139
Look, just call me back, okay?

16:17.509 --> 16:18.476
Who was that?

16:18.509 --> 16:20.044
It's a long story.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.282
Well, guess I'm gonna
get dressed, then,

16:24.315 --> 16:26.752
and then we can figure
out what's next.

16:28.586 --> 16:30.254
Think what's next for
me to do is take a shower.

16:30.288 --> 16:32.090
I don't really have
anything to change into.

16:32.123 --> 16:34.293
I wasn't exactly planning
on staying anywhere.

16:36.126 --> 16:38.697
Well, I put a towel out
for you, so you're set.

16:39.697 --> 16:40.566
Thanks.

17:23.674 --> 17:25.476
Now where did she go?

17:33.651 --> 17:35.120
Three.

17:35.153 --> 17:36.221
Two.

17:36.253 --> 17:40.458
One.

17:40.491 --> 17:42.426
Okay, that was weird.

17:42.460 --> 17:43.828
What?

17:43.862 --> 17:45.430
Just then, I knew
that you were gonna walk

17:45.462 --> 17:46.865
through the door.

17:46.897 --> 17:48.733
Well, I knew you
were still here.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.571
It's like some kinda
crazy GPS or something.

17:53.605 --> 17:54.839
I don't know.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.374
Where'd you go?

17:56.406 --> 17:57.375
Got us breakfast.

17:59.743 --> 18:00.878
Good call.

18:14.558 --> 18:15.594
Yeah?!

18:15.626 --> 18:16.728
What are you doing?!

18:16.760 --> 18:18.497
You been here all night?

18:20.230 --> 18:22.100
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I have.

18:23.734 --> 18:26.170
So those videos
are that good, huh?

18:26.203 --> 18:26.871
Yeah.

18:28.306 --> 18:30.142
Yeah, they're something,
I'll tell you.

18:30.174 --> 18:33.310
Just can't figure out what
they were doing in the house.

18:33.344 --> 18:36.715
Don't know, but I brought
the coroner's report.

18:36.748 --> 18:38.784
Turns out, neither of
them were on drugs.

18:39.851 --> 18:41.353
What? That's impossible.

18:41.385 --> 18:42.587
These two were crazy!

18:51.229 --> 18:51.997
Well, damn.

18:53.597 --> 18:55.334
What the hell was
wrong with them?

18:56.701 --> 18:59.703
Don't know, but
it wasn't drugs.

19:00.904 --> 19:01.772
Well, shit.

19:07.377 --> 19:08.880
Should we go
back to the scene?

19:11.883 --> 19:14.186
Maybe something
else was going on.

19:15.953 --> 19:17.821
I don't know. Couldn't hurt.

19:17.855 --> 19:19.924
It's a good idea, Gallagher.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.561
Why don't you set
that up for later?

19:22.594 --> 19:24.429
I'll go over this
footage some more.

19:26.263 --> 19:27.231
Okay.

19:27.265 --> 19:28.267
I'll swing by later.

19:50.922 --> 19:54.593
Okay, so I've been thinking.

19:56.394 --> 19:58.262
Yeah? What's that?

19:58.296 --> 19:59.831
We need to go
back to the spot.

20:02.366 --> 20:03.801
Wait, are you serious?

20:03.835 --> 20:05.703
Yeah.

20:05.737 --> 20:06.705
I mean, we need to figure
out if it's still there.

20:07.805 --> 20:09.507
Why do you care?

20:09.539 --> 20:11.276
Look, I don't ever
want to get near

20:11.308 --> 20:12.711
whatever the hell
that thing was again.

20:12.743 --> 20:14.278
Okay, but listen to me.

20:15.579 --> 20:17.414
What if other people
find it, okay?

20:17.448 --> 20:19.884
What if other people find
it and, I don't know,

20:19.916 --> 20:21.019
they get whatever
the hell we got,

20:21.051 --> 20:22.953
and it starts killing them?

20:22.987 --> 20:25.390
Vera, we don't even know
what the hell we've got.

20:25.423 --> 20:27.325
Yeah, exactly.

20:27.357 --> 20:30.261
Look, you know what, I'm going,

20:30.295 --> 20:32.297
so I'd really like it
if you came with me.

20:36.768 --> 20:38.269
Shit.

20:52.717 --> 20:56.788
So do you really think
thing thing's still there?

20:56.820 --> 20:58.022
I don't know.

21:02.026 --> 21:04.829
Vera, let's hope it
doesn't make us any worse

21:04.862 --> 21:06.731
or decide to kill us this time.

21:08.532 --> 21:10.067
Okay, if it was
going to kill us,

21:10.101 --> 21:13.705
don't you think it
would have already?

21:13.738 --> 21:15.673
I guess you're right.

21:20.377 --> 21:21.045
So?

21:36.560 --> 21:40.064
Well, I mean, it must
have been over there, right?

21:41.499 --> 21:42.866
Over there?

21:42.900 --> 21:44.936
It's over there, I
think, but I don't know.

21:46.738 --> 21:48.907
I don't feel it like I
did that night, you know?

21:49.906 --> 21:51.576
Yeah, me neither.

21:51.608 --> 21:54.044
I mean, it was,
like, calling to me.

21:54.077 --> 21:55.646
Exactly.

21:55.680 --> 22:00.118
The only thing I
feel now is you.

22:00.151 --> 22:01.019
Me too.

22:04.989 --> 22:05.957
Let's keep going.

22:21.638 --> 22:23.774
This is where I woke up.

22:24.776 --> 22:25.777
I was right...

22:26.711 --> 22:29.014
No, I was right here.

22:31.449 --> 22:32.851
What?

22:32.884 --> 22:34.451
What is it?

22:34.484 --> 22:36.086
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

22:36.119 --> 22:38.088
This is where I woke up.

22:38.122 --> 22:39.457
Like, right by me?

22:39.490 --> 22:40.892
No, no, no, no, no.

22:40.924 --> 22:43.728
Like, literally, I
woke up right here.

22:43.760 --> 22:44.863
When I got up and looked around,

22:44.895 --> 22:46.597
this is exactly where I was.

22:47.597 --> 22:49.166
I don't understand.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.802
I don't understand either.

22:50.835 --> 22:52.670
So how the hell could we
have missed each other

22:52.702 --> 22:54.739
if we were literally right
on top of each other?

22:54.771 --> 22:56.974
You must not be
remembering it right.

22:58.041 --> 22:59.843
No, I'm remembering it fine.

22:59.876 --> 23:01.913
Well, then maybe I
was gone by that point?

23:03.748 --> 23:06.485
But then where the hell
was I before I got here?

23:07.484 --> 23:08.119
Well...

23:10.887 --> 23:15.894
Okay, now that I think about
it, when it happened...

23:18.462 --> 23:21.165
Okay, I was thrown over here.

23:21.199 --> 23:22.067
And you...

23:23.667 --> 23:27.738
I was here and then
I got pushed this way.

23:27.771 --> 23:29.874
So how the hell did we end
up in the same spot here?

23:29.906 --> 23:30.775
Exactly.

23:34.244 --> 23:37.815
So, I mean,

23:40.050 --> 23:42.086
how did we end up right here?

23:45.021 --> 23:46.657
Look, I don't know.

23:46.691 --> 23:48.492
When I got up, I looked
around, nobody was here.

23:48.526 --> 23:49.928
I had to come find
you, remember?

23:49.961 --> 23:52.830
So when you woke up,
where the hell was I?

23:55.566 --> 23:56.434
I don't know.

23:58.269 --> 24:00.137
Okay, I woke up here,
no one was around.

24:00.171 --> 24:01.873
I walked back to my car and...

24:05.142 --> 24:06.445
Exactly, Vera.

24:08.011 --> 24:12.082
If we were right here,
on top of each other,

24:12.115 --> 24:13.718
how could you have missed me?

24:13.750 --> 24:14.752
I have no idea.

24:18.689 --> 24:20.191
All right, Foster, I don't think

24:20.223 --> 24:21.960
we're gonna find
any answers here.

24:24.595 --> 24:26.964
Yeah, I think you're right.

24:26.998 --> 24:30.035
Whatever was here is gone
now, so let's just go.

24:33.037 --> 24:34.239
Yeah, let's just go.

24:52.155 --> 24:53.023
Okay.

24:54.090 --> 24:55.894
I need you to stay in the car.

24:57.728 --> 24:58.863
What?

24:58.895 --> 25:00.097
It'll only be a minute.

25:02.133 --> 25:03.869
Wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait.

25:06.336 --> 25:07.271
You know that guy?

25:09.006 --> 25:10.208
Yeah.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.942
Wait. How'd you know?

25:14.045 --> 25:15.712
I'm not sure, I just...

25:15.746 --> 25:16.915
I kinda feel it.

25:22.252 --> 25:23.922
Okay, just stay
in the car. Okay?

25:38.035 --> 25:38.903
Mathew.

25:41.071 --> 25:43.307
What the fuck?

26:14.971 --> 26:16.007
What's up?

26:16.039 --> 26:17.875
We just got a call.

26:17.907 --> 26:19.644
They got another one of
those gas station robberies.

26:19.676 --> 26:20.911
What, like the last time?

26:20.944 --> 26:21.846
Worse.

26:26.817 --> 26:27.685
Hey, wait up.

26:57.981 --> 26:59.750
Need to speak to the
detective in charge here.

26:59.784 --> 27:00.885
Okay. You can go in.

27:00.917 --> 27:02.085
Did you get their statements?

27:02.118 --> 27:03.221
- Yes.
- What about this guy?

27:03.253 --> 27:04.121
On it.

27:19.336 --> 27:20.404
You in charge here?

27:20.438 --> 27:21.773
Kurt McDonald, sir.

27:23.140 --> 27:24.876
What in the
hell happened here?

27:24.909 --> 27:27.445
Still trying to
figure that out.

27:27.478 --> 27:29.047
Looks like a mess.

27:29.079 --> 27:30.181
Do you know who did
this to these two?

27:30.213 --> 27:31.148
They did.

27:32.750 --> 27:33.984
They did?

27:34.018 --> 27:35.185
That's right.

27:35.219 --> 27:36.788
They attacked each other.

27:38.189 --> 27:40.458
Hell, seems some of them
even stabbed themselves.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.059
Wait a minute.

27:42.093 --> 27:44.228
Why in the hell
would they do that?

27:44.260 --> 27:45.363
Don't know.

27:45.395 --> 27:47.230
Witness says that when he came

27:47.263 --> 27:49.067
in the store, they were asleep.

27:49.967 --> 27:51.335
Asleep?

27:51.367 --> 27:53.270
Yeah, like, on
the ground sleeping.

27:54.404 --> 27:56.374
Tried to wake them up, couldn't,

27:56.406 --> 27:59.176
went outside to try
and get some help.

27:59.210 --> 28:01.446
When he turned around,
they were waking up.

28:01.479 --> 28:03.881
Then, they started going crazy.

28:03.913 --> 28:05.916
Wait a minute, so
you're telling me that guy

28:05.950 --> 28:09.353
out there talking to the officer,
he witnessed all of this?

28:09.385 --> 28:11.021
Yeah, that's what he said.

28:12.088 --> 28:14.091
Can't call him a liar just yet.

28:14.125 --> 28:15.826
Just got to wait for the
footage to come back.

28:15.859 --> 28:18.161
Footage? You got
footage of all of this?

28:18.194 --> 28:20.998
Well, the DVR got
busted up pretty good,

28:21.030 --> 28:24.234
but tech guys say that
it's one of those kinds

28:24.268 --> 28:25.836
that links up to the cloud,

28:25.869 --> 28:28.038
so just got to wait
for the company

28:28.071 --> 28:30.140
to get us the footage
in a day or so.

28:30.173 --> 28:32.309
Can you get that to
us as soon as possible?

28:32.343 --> 28:33.878
Sure.

28:33.911 --> 28:36.047
- Thanks, Kurt.
- Get you boys a copy.

28:49.559 --> 28:50.861
You're thinking it's
a lot like what happened

28:50.894 --> 28:52.296
at that other place, aren't you?

28:52.328 --> 28:54.298
Well, it's exactly
like the other place.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.000
Well, with the exception
of the whole waking up

28:56.032 --> 28:57.434
and killing each other part.

28:57.468 --> 28:59.003
Yeah, except for that.

28:59.036 --> 29:00.772
Otherwise, same scenario.

29:02.472 --> 29:05.876
It is weird, but it's
still real different.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.912
Yeah. Let's
head on back to base.

29:18.588 --> 29:19.456
What?

29:21.025 --> 29:22.460
You want
to talk about it?

29:26.262 --> 29:30.801
Not much to say,
except I'm screwed now.

29:34.371 --> 29:36.073
Well, if that's the case,

29:36.105 --> 29:38.475
then, I mean, might
as well just tell me.

29:45.249 --> 29:46.918
That guy outside,

29:50.554 --> 29:52.090
he used to be my boyfriend.

29:54.258 --> 29:57.828
Yeah, I mean, I kinda put
that one together myself.

30:00.330 --> 30:04.234
Yeah, he's not a nice person.

30:06.537 --> 30:10.208
Actually, threw me
out when I found out

30:10.240 --> 30:12.810
about his whore that he
was seeing on the side.

30:14.244 --> 30:15.879
Wow.

30:15.913 --> 30:17.582
So he was cheating on
you and threw you out.

30:19.115 --> 30:20.884
That's a real great
guy right there.

30:22.653 --> 30:24.087
Such a piece of shit.

30:30.059 --> 30:32.163
And now he canceled
the card I'm using,

30:32.195 --> 30:34.197
so I have one day
left in this place

30:34.230 --> 30:36.134
and then I'm on the streets.

30:40.371 --> 30:44.242
And you don't have
any savings or anything?

30:44.275 --> 30:45.143
No.

30:48.679 --> 30:52.115
God, he would get me fired
from every job I ever had.

30:55.118 --> 30:57.888
Always causing a scene,
saying I was the one cheating,

30:57.922 --> 31:00.357
when he was the one that
had the fucking whore.

31:05.229 --> 31:08.032
So now all I have is about $20

31:08.065 --> 31:09.467
and what you see in this room.

31:13.002 --> 31:14.638
He took everything from me.

31:16.105 --> 31:18.542
Just left me out in the cold.

31:21.211 --> 31:22.279
Well, look, I mean,

31:24.181 --> 31:26.150
we're gonna figure
something out, okay?

31:29.586 --> 31:30.454
Why?

31:35.259 --> 31:36.326
Why do this for me?

31:38.595 --> 31:40.964
Don't you have somewhere
that you're trying to get to?

31:40.998 --> 31:43.167
I mean, yeah, but...

31:43.200 --> 31:48.206
Look, I can't leave
you like this, okay?

31:50.007 --> 31:52.209
Another day or two here isn't
gonna hurt anything and...

31:52.241 --> 31:53.576
Look, I'll make sure
you're set up somewhere

31:53.609 --> 31:54.978
before I leave, okay?

32:01.417 --> 32:05.022
Vera, we're connect now, right?

32:06.656 --> 32:11.361
And, I mean,
you don't get super powers

32:13.196 --> 32:14.197
with somebody and then just
leave them like this, do you?

32:18.067 --> 32:19.537
I mean, right?

32:26.175 --> 32:27.979
Especially someone
who can't use

32:28.011 --> 32:30.380
their powers on
the other person.

32:30.413 --> 32:31.548
- Right?
- We can't even use it

32:31.582 --> 32:35.152
on each other.

32:35.184 --> 32:36.019
It's stupid.

32:39.455 --> 32:41.057
Okay, it's not that funny.

32:41.090 --> 32:42.459
- It's kinda funny.
- It's not that funny.

32:42.492 --> 32:43.660
It is kinda funny.

32:43.693 --> 32:48.633
I mean, come on.

32:50.267 --> 32:52.635
You really want to
compare the two cases?

32:52.669 --> 32:54.138
Yeah, I do,
Gallagher, all right?

32:54.171 --> 32:55.472
They're too similar not to.

32:57.273 --> 32:58.608
Well, with the exception
of the whole waking up

32:58.642 --> 33:00.510
and killing each other part.

33:00.544 --> 33:03.081
Yeah, well, we know they're
connected, that's for sure.

33:04.748 --> 33:07.351
What happened at the
last gas station robbery?

33:07.384 --> 33:08.551
What happened?

33:08.585 --> 33:09.687
What did we find out?

33:09.720 --> 33:11.555
Well, the place was a wreck,

33:11.587 --> 33:14.191
three people were knocked
out by unknown means,

33:14.223 --> 33:16.659
all the cash was gone,
and nobody knew anything.

33:16.692 --> 33:18.695
Ah, except for the
guy in the restroom.

33:18.729 --> 33:22.333
He says he remembered some
guy and some girl there

33:22.365 --> 33:23.768
just before he passed out.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.336
He said he sorta
remembered it,

33:25.368 --> 33:27.637
but it was vague, like a fog.

33:27.671 --> 33:29.440
Well, we know know
they weren't on drugs.

33:29.472 --> 33:32.809
So tell me this, what
makes a person pass out

33:32.843 --> 33:35.146
and then forget the
last 10 minutes?!

33:35.179 --> 33:38.816
I don't know, Puller, some
kinda gas leak or something?

33:38.848 --> 33:40.550
Nah, I don't buy that.

33:40.584 --> 33:42.586
You're telling me two
different gas stations

33:42.618 --> 33:44.221
have the same gas leak,

33:44.253 --> 33:47.323
except this time, the
gas makes you pass out,

33:47.356 --> 33:49.394
wake up, and go on
a killing spree?

33:51.260 --> 33:56.134
Look, it's obvious something
weird is happening, but what?

33:59.736 --> 34:02.206
Maybe it's some kinda sickness.

34:02.239 --> 34:03.341
Like a virus.

34:04.708 --> 34:06.444
Nah, I don't buy
that, Gallagher.

34:06.477 --> 34:09.079
How many viruses you
know rip off a joint

34:09.112 --> 34:10.380
and then take a tape of it?

34:12.215 --> 34:14.684
Yeah, well, maybe the
people did it themselves.

34:14.717 --> 34:18.056
I mean, they don't remember
and they went crazy this time.

34:23.293 --> 34:24.495
Maybe it's mutating.

34:28.164 --> 34:29.467
A zombie apocalypse.

34:31.300 --> 34:34.572
Did you just say a fucking
zombie apocalypse, Gallagher?

34:34.605 --> 34:36.474
You watch way too much TV.

34:37.541 --> 34:38.775
Take this serious, would you?

34:41.777 --> 34:44.813
Speaking of TV, see you're
still watching your video.

34:44.847 --> 34:46.416
What's on it?

34:46.449 --> 34:47.417
I don't know.

34:47.451 --> 34:49.119
Some weird shit.

34:49.152 --> 34:51.588
I think it some kinda movie.

34:53.322 --> 34:55.158
What kinda movie?

34:55.192 --> 34:57.360
One that you'd probably
like, a cheap independent one.

34:57.393 --> 34:58.895
It's basically two kids filming

34:58.929 --> 35:01.199
themselves getting
some kinda powers.

35:04.534 --> 35:05.802
What kinda powers?

35:05.835 --> 35:07.637
I don't know yet.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.506
It looks like they're
testing them on each other.

35:13.577 --> 35:16.580
So you think that Mathew
guy was in the film business?

35:16.612 --> 35:19.182
Don't know, but I
can't stop watching this.

35:19.215 --> 35:20.416
I need to see what
happens to them.

35:20.449 --> 35:21.751
It's, like, sucking me in.

35:23.719 --> 35:25.388
What does it have
to do with the case?

35:25.422 --> 35:26.824
I don't know, Gallagher.

35:26.856 --> 35:28.358
Could be nothing,
could be everything.

35:28.391 --> 35:29.726
Fucking eh, man.

35:32.496 --> 35:33.898
Okay.

35:33.931 --> 35:35.865
Well, I'll let you get
back to your movie.

35:35.898 --> 35:37.768
I'll let you know when the
video from the store comes in.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.136
Yeah, you do that.

35:39.802 --> 35:40.704
Hey, thanks.

35:43.306 --> 35:44.841
The fuck is that?

36:14.871 --> 36:15.740
So?

36:19.576 --> 36:21.746
You gonna tell me
who you keep calling?

36:22.846 --> 36:25.248
It's really not important.

36:25.282 --> 36:27.351
Okay, don't give me that.

36:27.384 --> 36:28.952
Look, I've been watching
you the past few days,

36:28.985 --> 36:30.887
and you're calling
the same person

36:30.920 --> 36:34.490
and they're not picking up, so
it's obviously bothering you.

36:34.523 --> 36:39.262
So, come on, tell me who
you're trying to call.

36:43.567 --> 36:47.505
It's my girlfriend, or I guess
I should say ex-girlfriend.

36:50.373 --> 36:51.241
What happened?

36:54.411 --> 36:57.914
We got in a
fight, over nothing.

36:57.947 --> 37:02.518
I overreacted, she overreacted,
and the next thing I know,

37:02.552 --> 37:04.622
she's packing her
stuff and leaving.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.023
Instead of stopping her,

37:06.056 --> 37:08.259
I just kept yelling
like an asshole.

37:10.327 --> 37:11.729
- That's rough.
- Yeah.

37:13.764 --> 37:14.999
Where'd she go?

37:16.666 --> 37:18.768
Her mom's, I guess.

37:18.802 --> 37:20.570
I don't really know for sure,

37:20.603 --> 37:22.572
but that's where she
normally goes when we fight.

37:24.340 --> 37:26.809
By the time I was
ready to go down there

37:26.842 --> 37:30.447
and get her back,
well, it happened.

37:41.557 --> 37:46.463
So that's why you
were on the road?

37:48.664 --> 37:49.532
Yeah.

37:54.538 --> 37:58.376
Was on my way to her mom's
house when I saw that light.

37:59.809 --> 38:03.380
It just, I don't know,
it kinda called to me.

38:05.782 --> 38:09.553
Then I saw you, and
boom, next thing I know,

38:09.585 --> 38:11.755
it's a day later and
I've got a brain tumor.

38:16.393 --> 38:18.028
So now what?

38:20.429 --> 38:22.365
You gonna go after her?

38:24.701 --> 38:27.471
I mean, I don't know,

38:27.503 --> 38:29.973
I've called her, like,
a thousand times and...

38:32.409 --> 38:33.844
I mean, I've left her
a ton of messages.

38:33.876 --> 38:35.478
I even told her I
was in an accident

38:35.512 --> 38:37.682
and she still hasn't
called me back, so...

38:39.548 --> 38:43.353
I mean, I don't know, maybe
she's really done, you know?

38:47.423 --> 38:52.061
But I mean, look, I
have to try, right?

38:52.094 --> 38:55.998
Like, I have to go down there

38:56.032 --> 38:58.568
and have her tell me to
my face that she's done.

39:03.773 --> 39:05.009
Can I ask you something?

39:06.576 --> 39:07.445
Sure.

39:12.114 --> 39:13.750
Do you really love her?

39:18.688 --> 39:23.693
I do.

39:26.695 --> 39:30.634
Then you should do it.

39:33.170 --> 39:36.374
You should go after her.

39:38.708 --> 39:41.778
I mean, hold on, look,

39:41.811 --> 39:44.614
I told you I was gonna help
you get situated before I left,

39:44.648 --> 39:46.083
and I'm a man of my word, okay?

39:47.217 --> 39:48.485
Okay, but why?

39:49.786 --> 39:51.688
Why go so far to help me?

39:52.755 --> 39:54.625
I mean, you don't know me.

39:54.657 --> 39:56.893
You could head down the road
right now and forget about me,

39:56.927 --> 39:58.496
never think of me again.

40:00.597 --> 40:04.969
Vera, I think we both
know that's not true.

40:12.876 --> 40:13.744
I'm sorry.

40:19.483 --> 40:20.151
It's her.

40:23.887 --> 40:25.155
Well, take it.

40:37.701 --> 40:39.001
Hey, Foster.

40:39.034 --> 40:41.070
Just got your
message, or messages.

40:42.905 --> 40:44.507
You said you were in
some kind of accident?

40:44.541 --> 40:46.109
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

40:46.141 --> 40:47.743
No, I'm fine.

40:47.777 --> 40:51.648
Well, it's really good
to hear your voice.

40:51.681 --> 40:53.250
Well, I didn't have my phone.

40:53.282 --> 40:55.985
My mom, she decided I
needed a little getaway

40:56.018 --> 40:57.954
and some time to think.

40:57.987 --> 40:59.655
What's going on, Foster?

40:59.688 --> 41:00.990
Yeah, no, look, it's fine.

41:01.023 --> 41:02.092
I was just worried.

41:05.628 --> 41:07.063
Can we just meet up
and talk? Please?

41:07.097 --> 41:08.232
Look, I was actually
on my way to see you

41:08.264 --> 41:09.967
when it happened, and I just-

41:10.000 --> 41:11.934
- What did happen?

41:11.967 --> 41:13.703
What aren't you
telling me, Foster?

41:13.737 --> 41:16.072
I'm fine. It was
just a little accident.

41:16.106 --> 41:17.808
It laid me up in this town
not to far from you, actually.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.609
So, I mean, I could
just meet you.

41:19.643 --> 41:20.577
Today?

41:20.610 --> 41:21.846
Yeah. Oh.

41:22.778 --> 41:24.114
No, wait. Not today.

41:25.715 --> 41:27.117
I don't get it.

41:27.150 --> 41:29.052
You leave all these
messages on my machine

41:29.085 --> 41:31.922
and now you can't even
meet up and talk with me?

41:31.954 --> 41:32.922
What's going on?

41:32.956 --> 41:34.525
No, look, of course

41:34.557 --> 41:35.992
I want to meet up with
you, I just can't.

41:36.025 --> 41:37.527
It's the accident,
messed up the car.

41:37.561 --> 41:38.961
And, you know, I mean,

41:38.994 --> 41:39.962
that's why I haven't
been able to see you.

41:39.996 --> 41:41.565
I've been stuck here.

41:41.597 --> 41:42.965
How bad was the accident?

41:42.998 --> 41:44.201
Foster, what aren't
you telling me?

41:44.233 --> 41:45.568
No, look, it's fine.

41:45.601 --> 41:47.136
It really wasn't that bad.

41:47.170 --> 41:48.771
I should get the
car back tomorrow,

41:48.804 --> 41:50.540
and then I could just
head right down to you.

41:50.574 --> 41:51.942
Okay, yeah, I get it.

41:51.974 --> 41:54.545
I'll just wait for your
call tomorrow, okay?

41:54.577 --> 41:59.583
Awesome. And, Tracy,
I really miss you.

42:00.650 --> 42:02.119
I miss you too, Foster.

42:02.152 --> 42:04.621
Just call me tomorrow, okay?

42:06.289 --> 42:08.158
Okay, absolutely.
Okay, I'll talk to you then.

42:08.190 --> 42:09.058
Bye.

42:24.673 --> 42:26.909
So how'd it go?

42:26.943 --> 42:28.946
She agreed to see me.

42:28.978 --> 42:30.079
Cool.

42:30.112 --> 42:31.213
What are you waiting for?

42:31.246 --> 42:32.882
Well, I told her tomorrow.

42:35.217 --> 42:36.085
Why?

42:37.686 --> 42:39.221
Well, I told you
I was gonna get

42:39.255 --> 42:40.856
you situated before I left.

42:40.889 --> 42:42.725
I meant it. I'm
a man of my word.

42:42.759 --> 42:45.829
Although I don't have any idea
how I'm gonna do that yet.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.235
So I've been thinking.

42:53.268 --> 42:54.337
Have an idea.

42:54.371 --> 42:55.972
Okay.

42:56.005 --> 42:57.708
All right, but
it's kinda crazy.

42:59.009 --> 43:00.610
Don't know if
you've noticed, Vera,

43:00.643 --> 43:01.277
but crazy's kind
of our thing now.

43:05.914 --> 43:07.250
Okay, this is crazy.

43:08.318 --> 43:10.053
Well, we have these powers,

43:10.085 --> 43:12.655
might as well do
something good with them.

43:12.688 --> 43:14.790
Vera, robbing a
store isn't good.

43:14.824 --> 43:16.226
Well, we're not
robbing the store,

43:16.259 --> 43:19.829
we're robbing the
insurance money.

43:19.862 --> 43:23.165
Plus, that kid in
there is a total dick.

43:23.199 --> 43:25.235
He sells drugs to
underaged kids, Foster.

43:27.003 --> 43:28.805
How does that make robbing
the place okay, Vera?

43:28.838 --> 43:30.274
Because we're not robbing it.

43:32.108 --> 43:33.977
Okay, the insurance company
will pay the owners back,

43:34.010 --> 43:38.015
the kid will lose his job, and
we'll have a place to stay.

43:38.047 --> 43:39.048
It's a win-win.

43:41.418 --> 43:43.988
I cannot believe you
actually want to do this.

43:46.121 --> 43:48.424
What's even weirder is I
can't believe I feel like

43:48.458 --> 43:50.260
I actually want to do this.

43:50.293 --> 43:51.894
Right? So let's go.

43:51.927 --> 43:53.295
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

43:53.329 --> 43:55.766
I mean, I'm not an
expert at this, Vera,

43:55.798 --> 43:58.768
but, like, don't we
need masks or something?

43:58.802 --> 44:00.437
Uh, we have superpowers.

44:00.469 --> 44:02.205
Do you really think
we need masks?

44:03.273 --> 44:05.108
See that guy in there?

44:05.141 --> 44:06.742
Yeah.

44:06.775 --> 44:08.011
He's gonna be
out like a light,

44:09.378 --> 44:11.114
sleeping like a baby
before we know it.

44:12.782 --> 44:14.117
Just watch.

44:20.190 --> 44:21.358
Out like a light.

44:21.391 --> 44:22.693
It worked.

44:22.726 --> 44:24.126
Now, we just grab the cash.

44:33.068 --> 44:34.337
Foster, come on.

44:58.027 --> 45:00.063
What are you doing?

45:00.096 --> 45:01.998
I'm grabbing snacks?

45:02.030 --> 45:04.134
I mean, why not?

45:06.302 --> 45:07.437
You actually read my mind.

45:19.983 --> 45:20.851
What is that?

45:22.786 --> 45:23.787
The security tape.

45:25.054 --> 45:25.923
That's smart.

45:45.108 --> 45:46.910
- Drop it, drop it!
- Whoa, hey!

45:46.943 --> 45:48.044
- You drop it now, now!
- Look, look, it's fine, man.

45:48.077 --> 45:49.179
Look, everybody's okay, man-

45:49.211 --> 45:50.813
You, drop it too!

45:50.847 --> 45:52.048
Hey, hey, no, no,
keep it pointed at me.

45:52.081 --> 45:53.817
- Shut up!
- Don't worry about her.

45:53.849 --> 45:55.018
- Shut up, drop it!
- Dude, it's okay, just stop!

45:55.050 --> 45:56.152
- Drop it.
- Foster.

45:56.186 --> 45:57.988
- Shut up!
- No.

45:58.021 --> 45:59.456
- If you don't shut up-
- Keep the gun pointed at me.

45:59.489 --> 46:01.124
If you don't shut
up, I'm gonna shoot

46:01.157 --> 46:01.992
- your little girlfriend.
- You will not hurt her!

46:17.539 --> 46:18.407
Foster.

46:19.909 --> 46:21.344
Hey, let's go.

46:21.376 --> 46:23.913
Let's go right now. Let's go.

46:53.275 --> 46:57.213
Okay, how the hell
did you do that?

46:58.547 --> 47:00.516
Vera, I don't even
know what I did.

47:00.550 --> 47:03.119
Oh, my god, Foster,
it was amazing.

47:03.152 --> 47:06.322
It was like I could feel
the power coming off of you

47:06.356 --> 47:08.058
and then going directly
into his brain.

47:08.090 --> 47:09.625
It was just like...

47:09.659 --> 47:11.494
Oh, my god, I've
never felt anything

47:11.527 --> 47:14.063
so powerfully like
that before, ever.

47:15.465 --> 47:17.434
I mean, I don't
know, I just...

47:17.467 --> 47:20.336
I was there and when I
thought he was gonna hurt you,

47:20.369 --> 47:22.172
I couldn't let him
and I just lost it,

47:22.204 --> 47:23.572
and it just, like, came out.

47:23.606 --> 47:24.942
It was amazing.

47:26.074 --> 47:30.547
- Jesus.
- Felt like pure power.

47:32.114 --> 47:33.549
I just
wonder if he's okay.

47:36.552 --> 47:38.188
Are you serious right now?

47:38.221 --> 47:39.623
Fuck him.

47:39.655 --> 47:41.557
Okay, that guy had
a gun pointed to me.

47:44.059 --> 47:45.394
And you saved me.

47:48.164 --> 47:49.032
Jesus.

47:52.135 --> 47:54.403
How could I do that
to somebody, Vera?

47:54.436 --> 47:59.442
I mean, I could
feel him hurting.

48:00.510 --> 48:01.345
How could I do that to somebody?

48:03.246 --> 48:04.280
To protect me.

48:07.382 --> 48:10.119
I think you wanted to save me.

48:13.121 --> 48:15.125
But, I mean, we
don't know that.

48:15.157 --> 48:17.027
He might not have even hurt you.

48:17.059 --> 48:19.695
Look, I could have just put
him to sleep like the others.

48:19.728 --> 48:21.497
Why did I use so much?

48:25.969 --> 48:28.972
I think you knew that
he was going to hurt me,

48:30.373 --> 48:33.409
and you wouldn't let him.

48:35.478 --> 48:37.481
I wouldn't let
anybody hurt you, Vera.

48:45.655 --> 48:46.489
Really?

48:46.521 --> 48:47.590
Of course.

48:50.425 --> 48:51.594
That's why you did it?

48:54.463 --> 48:56.032
You wanted to save me.

49:59.094 --> 50:01.230
Who in the hell is that?

50:02.297 --> 50:03.232
I'll check.

50:15.710 --> 50:16.812
Yes?

50:16.846 --> 50:18.514
Never got a payment yesterday,

50:18.547 --> 50:20.382
that means it's checkout time.

50:20.416 --> 50:21.451
Oh.

50:21.483 --> 50:23.318
Shit. Right, man.

50:23.351 --> 50:25.187
I'm sorry. Look, we're
gonna pay for another day.

50:25.221 --> 50:26.688
Can you just give us a
minute to come down there?

50:26.722 --> 50:28.125
Yeah. Well, you better.

50:37.632 --> 50:40.569
Guess we got too busy
to pay him last night.

50:40.603 --> 50:42.704
Yeah, but I think we should
go down there and pay him

50:42.737 --> 50:45.174
before he puts our
shit on the road, Vera.

50:45.208 --> 50:45.842
No.

50:45.875 --> 50:46.742
Fuck him.

50:48.577 --> 50:50.612
We'll just make him take a
little nap till we're ready.

50:50.646 --> 50:52.248
No, no, Vera.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.683
Look, can you just go
pay the man, please?

50:57.652 --> 50:58.521
Fine.

51:14.903 --> 51:16.239
Be right back.

51:25.914 --> 51:26.849
Oh, fuck.

51:35.625 --> 51:36.793
Hey, where you going?

51:37.860 --> 51:39.329
I got to see Tracy, remember?

51:40.329 --> 51:41.698
Yeah. Right.

51:41.731 --> 51:43.333
Yeah.

51:43.365 --> 51:45.735
Look, I know that we
were caught up in,

51:47.302 --> 51:49.404
well, whatever we were
feeling last night.

51:49.438 --> 51:52.407
And, hey, look, I'm not saying
I regret it or anything,

51:52.440 --> 51:57.446
but, I mean, I think we both
kinda know what it was, right?

51:58.246 --> 51:59.414
Totally.

51:59.447 --> 52:00.549
- I get it.
- Exactly.

52:00.583 --> 52:02.452
Look, I'm gonna go see Tracy,

52:02.485 --> 52:04.787
and then I'll come back and we
can talk over the craziness,

52:04.820 --> 52:08.691
and then we can just, you
know, get back to our lives.

52:08.724 --> 52:10.527
Right, that's all
we ever wanted to do

52:10.559 --> 52:12.228
in the first place, right?

52:12.260 --> 52:13.163
Exactly. Okay.

52:13.195 --> 52:14.163
Okay, I just...

52:14.197 --> 52:14.865
All right, okay.

52:16.565 --> 52:20.402
So you're good, right?

52:20.436 --> 52:21.604
Yeah.

52:21.637 --> 52:23.173
Foster, I'm an adult.

52:23.206 --> 52:24.274
I get it.

52:24.306 --> 52:25.841
Okay, I just...

52:25.875 --> 52:27.344
All right, all right, okay.

52:46.329 --> 52:48.965
Got that
surveillance footage back.

52:49.998 --> 52:50.766
That was quick.

52:52.635 --> 52:54.737
Well, if you
consider five hours quick,

52:54.769 --> 52:56.239
then yeah, sure.

52:57.773 --> 52:58.842
Five hours?

53:00.309 --> 53:01.978
Yeah.

53:02.010 --> 53:03.713
What, you lose track of time
watching your movie again?

53:03.746 --> 53:04.748
Yeah, I guess so.

53:05.748 --> 53:07.684
Five hours? Shit.

53:07.717 --> 53:09.519
Well, let's see
what's on this baby.

53:14.289 --> 53:15.724
Holy shit!

53:19.728 --> 53:21.697
What the hell is this? Are
these guys fucking with us?

53:21.731 --> 53:24.634
No, I mean, yeah, look,
this guy, I know this guy.

53:24.666 --> 53:26.835
He's all in the tapes
I've been watching.

53:26.869 --> 53:28.504
Skip ahead and,
like, ring me up so I can go?

53:28.536 --> 53:30.439
Hey,
buddy, wait your turn.

53:30.472 --> 53:31.840
What are you talking about?

53:31.873 --> 53:33.909
The home movie I found
at that crime scene,

53:33.943 --> 53:35.912
this guy's in it with some girl.

53:37.847 --> 53:40.283
So you're saying this is part
of some movie or something?

53:40.315 --> 53:42.518
No, yes, look, I don't
know what I'm saying.

53:42.550 --> 53:45.621
All I know is the guy in the
tape, his name is Foster.

53:47.623 --> 53:49.891
Foster? I don't get it.

53:49.925 --> 53:53.028
Oh, god, look, man, we got
to get this guy, all right?!

53:53.061 --> 53:54.029
All right.

53:54.063 --> 53:55.664
Put an APB on him!

53:55.697 --> 53:58.333
The next time he shows
up, I want to find him!

53:58.367 --> 54:00.403
Okay, get me a picture
of him and the girl,

54:00.436 --> 54:01.971
and we'll start to look
them up in the database,

54:02.003 --> 54:03.806
and if he's out
there, we'll find him.

54:03.838 --> 54:05.674
Yeah, you know what,
I want you to check all

54:05.708 --> 54:07.577
the shitty hotels that
are out there, all right?

54:07.610 --> 54:09.812
'Cause in the tapes, they're
sitting in some shitty hotel,

54:09.844 --> 54:12.281
making all these
videos, all right?!

54:12.315 --> 54:12.949
- All right.
- That's what I want

54:12.981 --> 54:14.284
you to get on!

54:14.317 --> 54:15.485
All right, I got it.

54:16.719 --> 54:17.921
Bring me some answers.

54:19.054 --> 54:19.989
Shit!

54:22.525 --> 54:23.727
Motherfucker!

54:40.643 --> 54:41.911
What the fuck?

54:42.978 --> 54:44.713
What is going on?

54:52.454 --> 54:53.322
Vera.

55:09.771 --> 55:11.507
Well, here we are.

55:14.643 --> 55:15.945
This is where I used to live

55:22.918 --> 55:25.889
before I got thrown away
like a piece of garbage.

55:28.056 --> 55:30.059
But she gets to live there now.

55:33.461 --> 55:35.030
Why was I not good
enough for him?

55:37.666 --> 55:39.536
Why am I not good
enough for anyone?

55:41.737 --> 55:43.340
What makes her better than me?

55:46.175 --> 55:47.043
Why?

55:49.144 --> 55:51.748
Well, I'll tell you something,

55:53.715 --> 55:55.050
I don't give a shit anymore.

55:57.119 --> 55:59.088
All my stuff is in
there and, yeah,

55:59.121 --> 56:03.059
he had the power to stop
me before, but not anymore.

56:04.960 --> 56:06.061
I have the power now.

56:08.030 --> 56:10.432
And I can stop him,
I can stop her,

56:12.867 --> 56:14.471
I can stop anyone.

56:17.940 --> 56:19.075
You're gonna watch me.

56:35.190 --> 56:36.992
What the fuck
are you doing here?

56:37.025 --> 56:38.627
I'm here for my things.

56:39.594 --> 56:41.430
Your things?

56:41.463 --> 56:44.701
Mathew threw all your garbage
out when he threw out you.

56:46.101 --> 56:47.737
- I'll check for myself.
- No.

56:47.769 --> 56:50.840
Bitch, get the fuck out
of my house, right now.

56:50.873 --> 56:52.575
- Your house?
- Yeah, this is my house.

56:52.608 --> 56:53.476
Get the fuck out.

56:53.509 --> 56:54.476
Fuck off!

56:55.844 --> 56:57.980
Oh, you're gonna
fucking die, bitch.

57:11.494 --> 57:14.831
Vera, what the fuck
are you doing here?

57:17.099 --> 57:19.169
You're next, lover boy.

58:02.545 --> 58:07.016
Vera, stop.

58:07.048 --> 58:08.050
Vera, stop!

58:08.083 --> 58:10.052
What were you doing?

58:10.085 --> 58:12.088
Why are you even here?

58:12.121 --> 58:14.523
I came to get my things
and he started yelling

58:14.556 --> 58:16.224
and he got violent, okay?

58:16.257 --> 58:17.292
I had to, okay?

58:17.326 --> 58:19.295
I had to.

58:19.327 --> 58:21.697
Vera, you were killing him.

58:21.730 --> 58:23.164
I could feel it.

58:23.197 --> 58:26.735
I could feel you.
You were so angry.

58:28.070 --> 58:29.005
You came for me.

58:29.938 --> 58:30.973
You stopped me.

58:32.106 --> 58:33.976
You saved me again.

58:34.009 --> 58:36.144
Vera, we have to get out
of here right now, okay?

58:36.177 --> 58:38.080
We have to go. Let's
get out of here.

58:43.952 --> 58:45.621
Was that your girlfriend?

58:45.653 --> 58:47.556
Yes, Vera, it was.

58:48.958 --> 58:50.760
Weren't you supposed
to be with her today?

58:50.793 --> 58:52.662
I was supposed to be
with her today, Vera,

58:52.695 --> 58:54.330
but I got halfway there
and I felt the rage in you

58:54.362 --> 58:56.899
and I had to come see what
the hell was going on.

58:59.101 --> 59:00.603
This connection we have,

59:04.139 --> 59:07.677
I can feel you.

59:07.710 --> 59:09.978
I can feel where
you are, Foster,

59:12.847 --> 59:16.251
and I just knew, I
knew you would save me.

59:17.920 --> 59:19.688
I know you would never, ever,

59:19.722 --> 59:21.591
let anything happen
to me, Foster.

59:21.623 --> 59:25.861
Look, look, look, Vera,
I didn't save you, okay?

59:27.695 --> 59:29.831
I saved Mathew because you
were going to kill him.

59:30.898 --> 59:34.636
Okay, I'm so sorry about that.

59:34.670 --> 59:36.806
Okay, I know killing
people is wrong.

59:36.838 --> 59:37.739
I get it.

59:37.773 --> 59:38.641
It's just...

59:40.208 --> 59:42.711
I don't know, this power,
or whatever this is,

59:42.744 --> 59:46.715
it just makes me, I don't know.

59:46.748 --> 59:48.317
Foster, I just lost
control sometimes.

59:48.349 --> 59:50.251
Okay, well, Vera,
you can't lose control,

59:50.284 --> 59:52.154
because when you
do, people get hurt.

59:53.222 --> 59:54.090
You're right.

59:55.056 --> 59:56.125
You're right.

01:00:00.061 --> 01:00:02.831
But I think that's
why it chose us.

01:00:04.766 --> 01:00:08.070
Think that's why the universe
chose us to be together,

01:00:09.338 --> 01:00:11.207
because we were
selected to be together,

01:00:12.173 --> 01:00:14.110
to figure out our powers

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:16.311
and figure out what we
need to use them for,

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:19.315
don't you think?

01:00:19.347 --> 01:00:22.250
Vera, okay, look,

01:00:24.085 --> 01:00:26.187
I want you to listen to what
you're saying, all right?

01:00:26.221 --> 01:00:28.056
We don't even know
each other, all right?

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:30.893
And whatever happened to
us, it was an accident.

01:00:30.925 --> 01:00:33.261
Hell, Vera, we don't even
know what happened to us,

01:00:33.295 --> 01:00:34.963
we don't know what
it's gonna do to us,

01:00:34.996 --> 01:00:37.032
and we can't just keep
using these powers,

01:00:37.065 --> 01:00:38.800
because people are getting hurt.

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:40.369
You think this is an accident?

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:44.840
After everything, Foster,
everything we've been through?

01:00:45.907 --> 01:00:46.875
How can you even say that?

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.277
And what about you?

01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:51.980
What about you at
the gas station, huh?

01:00:52.014 --> 01:00:53.883
What was that?

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.184
That was way worse than
something I've ever done.

01:00:55.217 --> 01:00:56.818
And you know what?

01:00:56.851 --> 01:00:57.719
You know what?

01:00:58.786 --> 01:01:00.822
Think you're the worse one here.

01:01:00.856 --> 01:01:04.393
Okay, Vera, first off, that
guy had a gun pointed at you

01:01:04.425 --> 01:01:06.362
and he was gonna hurt you, okay?

01:01:06.394 --> 01:01:08.297
And I didn't mean to do that.

01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:09.798
Hell, Vera, I didn't even
know that I could do that.

01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:13.902
But you did, just like me.

01:01:23.978 --> 01:01:27.449
We are are exactly
alike, you and me.

01:01:30.318 --> 01:01:32.320
We're meant to be
together, Foster.

01:01:34.056 --> 01:01:36.291
The universe chose
us to be together.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.360
Can't you feel it?

01:01:39.393 --> 01:01:40.262
Okay.

01:01:44.199 --> 01:01:48.971
Okay, I'm definitely feeling
something, all right?

01:01:49.003 --> 01:01:51.206
But it's just...

01:01:51.239 --> 01:01:52.340
You know, I still
have to process

01:01:52.373 --> 01:01:54.175
all this right now, you know?

01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:55.376
Yeah.

01:01:55.409 --> 01:01:57.011
I understand.

01:01:57.045 --> 01:02:01.284
Look, I understand
that it's a lot,

01:02:04.418 --> 01:02:09.424
but that's why it's so great,

01:02:10.492 --> 01:02:14.430
you balance me, I balance you.

01:02:14.463 --> 01:02:19.201
Vera, look, I'm
starving, okay?

01:02:19.233 --> 01:02:21.436
I think I should go get us some
food, and when I come back,

01:02:21.469 --> 01:02:23.404
we can talk about
this more, all right?

01:02:23.438 --> 01:02:24.907
Okay. So I'll come with you.

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.375
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:02:26.407 --> 01:02:29.010
Look, you have gone out
enough today, all right?

01:02:29.043 --> 01:02:30.145
I think you've done
more than enough,

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:32.847
so you just stay here, relax,

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.884
and I'll bring it
back for us, okay?

01:02:34.916 --> 01:02:35.851
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:02:39.487 --> 01:02:40.556
Mm-hm.

01:02:40.588 --> 01:02:41.956
Mm. Okay.

01:02:41.989 --> 01:02:42.858
Yup. Mm-hm.

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:45.961
I'll be right back.

01:02:45.994 --> 01:02:47.262
You just stay here, all right?

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:49.231
Hurry.

01:02:49.264 --> 01:02:50.566
Starving.

01:03:06.447 --> 01:03:07.983
This is Puller.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.253
Oh, no shit.

01:03:12.286 --> 01:03:14.022
All right, put an
APB on that tag.

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:15.157
Yeah, do it right away.

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:16.525
Make sure I'm informed directly

01:03:16.557 --> 01:03:18.027
when that car is
found, you understand?

01:03:20.195 --> 01:03:21.297
Son of a bitch.

01:03:51.059 --> 01:03:51.861
Hello?

01:03:53.228 --> 01:03:54.329
Foster, what's going on?

01:03:54.362 --> 01:03:55.998
I thought we were gonna meet?

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:57.900
Yeah, I know.

01:03:57.932 --> 01:03:59.501
Look, I got the car late,
then something came up.

01:03:59.534 --> 01:04:01.170
Look, it's not important, okay?

01:04:01.202 --> 01:04:02.971
I have the car, can you meet?

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:03.873
Now?

01:04:06.074 --> 01:04:06.943
It's late.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.545
I know, I just...

01:04:09.577 --> 01:04:10.545
Look, I don't care.

01:04:10.579 --> 01:04:12.081
I need to see you.

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:13.916
And I'm sorry, I just...

01:04:13.949 --> 01:04:15.050
Just meet me.

01:04:22.056 --> 01:04:23.192
Okay. Where?

01:04:24.659 --> 01:04:25.960
The same place.

01:04:25.994 --> 01:04:27.028
I can be there in an hour.

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:33.001
Okay.

01:04:34.936 --> 01:04:36.905
Better show this time, Foster.

01:04:36.938 --> 01:04:38.039
I will.

01:04:38.072 --> 01:04:40.174
Look, I'm on my way, okay?

01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:42.211
Okay. I'll see you there.

01:05:04.231 --> 01:05:06.067
Look, man, if you don't have
the money, you have to go.

01:05:06.101 --> 01:05:07.469
Come on, man, I know
it's all there. Count it.

01:05:07.501 --> 01:05:10.239
Look, man,
you need to move along.

01:05:10.271 --> 01:05:11.574
Really? You serious?

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:15.110
No, I'm sure I
have it all here somewhere.

01:05:18.413 --> 01:05:19.681
Are you serious?

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:21.350
- What are you saying?
- Look, man,

01:05:21.382 --> 01:05:22.483
if you don't have the
money, you have to go.

01:05:22.516 --> 01:05:23.484
What are you talking about?

01:05:23.518 --> 01:05:25.086
It's all right there.

01:05:25.119 --> 01:05:26.521
Look, man, you
need to move along.

01:05:26.554 --> 01:05:27.222
- Really?
- Come on, man, count it.

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:31.025
Hey, man, I'm in a hurry.

01:05:31.059 --> 01:05:32.428
Can I just skip ahead and,
like, ring me up so I can go?

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.561
Hey, buddy, wait
your turn, all right?

01:05:33.594 --> 01:05:34.696
Come on, man, count it again.

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.298
I know it's all got to be there.

01:05:36.331 --> 01:05:37.700
I've counted it
twice, so get the rest

01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:39.034
- of the money or go!
- Don't make me count it

01:05:39.067 --> 01:05:40.402
for you, man.

01:05:40.434 --> 01:05:42.003
- Are you serious?
- I'm really in a hurry.

01:05:42.036 --> 01:05:43.137
- Can I just, like-
- Hey, man, I told you

01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:44.272
to fucking wait your turn.

01:05:44.306 --> 01:05:45.407
Look, dude, count it again.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.509
I know it's all fucking there.

01:05:50.311 --> 01:05:52.514
Dude, are you
okay? What the fuck?!

01:05:52.547 --> 01:05:54.516
I don't know, man.
He's fine, probably.

01:05:54.548 --> 01:05:56.117
Can you ring me up so I can
get out of here, please?

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:57.286
Man, got to call the police.

01:05:57.318 --> 01:05:58.487
No, no. For him?

01:05:58.519 --> 01:06:00.288
Dude, he's fine.
Look, he's good.

01:06:00.322 --> 01:06:01.423
Just ring me up so I
can get out of here,

01:06:01.456 --> 01:06:02.557
then you can do whatever-

01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:04.192
- I'll get with you in a minute.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.262
- Fuck this.
- Hello?

01:06:08.663 --> 01:06:10.298
Okay.

01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:11.534
Oh, go to sleep.

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:48.831
Well, you took a while.

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:51.833
Yeah, well, that
place was packed, so...

01:07:54.268 --> 01:07:55.136
For you.

01:08:11.519 --> 01:08:12.721
So what are you thinking?

01:08:14.289 --> 01:08:15.858
That this is a
damn good burger.

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:20.496
No, Vera, I mean about today.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:23.432
Look, we can't hurt people.

01:08:27.836 --> 01:08:28.703
You're right.

01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:32.439
You're right.

01:08:32.474 --> 01:08:35.511
Look, Foster, I'm sorry, okay?

01:08:35.542 --> 01:08:36.412
I just...

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:40.448
I don't know, I get
really angry sometimes

01:08:40.481 --> 01:08:43.783
and, you know, it's kinda
like you in the store.

01:08:43.818 --> 01:08:46.255
That one day? Like,
it just happens.

01:08:46.287 --> 01:08:51.292
Well, Vera, it can't happen,
because we hurt people, okay?

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:55.162
Look, no more using these powers

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:58.233
until we get a handle
on them at least.

01:09:01.935 --> 01:09:02.805
You're right.

01:09:04.805 --> 01:09:06.875
Okay, no more powers.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:13.249
But what about us?

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:16.384
What about us, Vera?

01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:19.220
Well, I mean,
you have to admit,

01:09:19.252 --> 01:09:21.856
we have this connection,
special bond.

01:09:23.457 --> 01:09:27.194
I mean, I can feel
you all the time,

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:32.234
whether you're mad
or sad or angry.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.904
And every day, it's
getting stronger.

01:09:40.307 --> 01:09:44.546
I feel it too, but I
have a life, you know?

01:09:46.814 --> 01:09:47.881
But do you?

01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:51.586
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

01:09:51.618 --> 01:09:53.520
but that girl of yours left you,

01:09:54.989 --> 01:09:58.359
and then this amazing
thing happens with us.

01:10:00.494 --> 01:10:05.233
I mean, it's like the
universe is trying

01:10:05.266 --> 01:10:06.768
to tell us something.

01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:08.537
And what's it
telling us, Vera?

01:10:10.939 --> 01:10:11.840
Both of us met,

01:10:14.609 --> 01:10:17.213
this all happened when
we lost everything.

01:10:19.514 --> 01:10:23.918
I mean, we had
nothing, and then this.

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:31.493
Foster, it's like the universe
want us to do something.

01:10:34.762 --> 01:10:38.367
Do what, Vera? I mean,
honestly, what can we do?

01:10:38.399 --> 01:10:39.768
We put people to sleep.

01:10:39.801 --> 01:10:41.970
I mean, what do you
even do with that power?

01:10:42.002 --> 01:10:44.872
Okay, it's obvious that
we can do more than that.

01:10:44.905 --> 01:10:45.908
It's just...

01:10:47.475 --> 01:10:49.945
Look, I can feel it
getting stronger.

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.347
We're getting stronger.

01:10:53.948 --> 01:10:55.550
Foster, if we stay together,

01:10:55.582 --> 01:10:57.385
I mean, who knows
what we can do?

01:11:00.954 --> 01:11:02.992
Look, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:06.762
I don't want it to get stronger.

01:11:08.363 --> 01:11:09.498
I don't like what
it's doing to me,

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:13.468
and I don't like how
it's making me feel.

01:11:13.501 --> 01:11:14.837
Well, I love it.

01:11:16.404 --> 01:11:17.439
It's powerful.

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:26.015
I don't feel right.

01:11:27.414 --> 01:11:30.985
Look, come here.

01:11:31.019 --> 01:11:33.289
Come here, come here.
Look, come sit down.

01:11:35.823 --> 01:11:37.425
Sit.

01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:39.094
You're probably
just tired, okay?

01:11:39.127 --> 01:11:40.862
You used it a lot today.

01:11:40.895 --> 01:11:43.865
Just feel, like, lightheaded.

01:11:44.865 --> 01:11:45.934
Here, lay down.

01:11:45.966 --> 01:11:46.835
Come here.

01:11:48.369 --> 01:11:50.037
It's okay.

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:51.006
That must be it.

01:11:51.939 --> 01:11:53.341
Foster?

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:54.710
- Yeah?
- Everyone leaves me.

01:11:57.444 --> 01:11:58.780
I'm always alone.

01:12:03.885 --> 01:12:05.020
Don't leave...

01:12:46.027 --> 01:12:47.796
The APB worked.

01:12:47.828 --> 01:12:48.929
What?

01:12:48.962 --> 01:12:50.831
Yeah. We got the guy's car.

01:12:50.864 --> 01:12:52.466
A highway camera picked it up,

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.969
and a black in white has
him heading into town.

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.103
Awesome.

01:12:55.136 --> 01:12:57.005
Look, tell him not to engage.

01:12:57.037 --> 01:12:59.740
Just keep an eye on him and
let us know where he goes.

01:12:59.774 --> 01:13:00.743
Let's get this guy.

01:13:08.048 --> 01:13:09.184
Hey. Tracy.

01:13:09.216 --> 01:13:10.818
Hey.

01:13:10.851 --> 01:13:12.686
Foster, you look like shit.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.525
Yeah, well, it's been a
hell of a couple days, Tracy.

01:13:16.557 --> 01:13:17.893
Yeah, well, it's
been for me too.

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.461
I mean, I can't believe
you even called me

01:13:19.493 --> 01:13:21.195
saying you got in an accident.

01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:23.030
Thought you were just making
it up just to try to see me.

01:13:23.064 --> 01:13:25.133
Tell me what's going on, babe.

01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:30.005
Look, I don't think
you'd believe me, Tracy.

01:13:30.037 --> 01:13:32.006
I don't think anybody
would believe me.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.576
That's a hell of an apology.

01:13:34.609 --> 01:13:37.078
No. No, look, I'm serious.

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:38.880
I don't think you'd believe me.

01:13:38.912 --> 01:13:41.916
Well, you know what,
I'm just gonna go.

01:13:41.949 --> 01:13:43.585
You can't tell me what's
going on, I'm just gonna get

01:13:43.618 --> 01:13:44.986
- the hell out of here-
- No, no, stop, stop.

01:13:45.019 --> 01:13:47.055
Okay, look, look, look, look,

01:13:47.087 --> 01:13:48.189
I was on my way
to see you, right?

01:13:48.222 --> 01:13:50.725
I was coming over to apologize,

01:13:50.757 --> 01:13:53.494
and on my way there, I
stopped at this place.

01:13:53.528 --> 01:13:55.963
And, you know, I still
don't know why I did it,

01:13:55.997 --> 01:13:57.731
something just kind
of drew me there.

01:13:57.765 --> 01:14:00.802
And there was this girl
there, and this thing.

01:14:00.835 --> 01:14:04.139
And it, like, affected us
somehow, and it connected us.

01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:06.540
And now, I, like,
feel her all the time.

01:14:06.573 --> 01:14:09.076
And, oh, it gave us these,
like, powers, Tracy.

01:14:09.109 --> 01:14:10.778
And I don't know how to explain,

01:14:10.811 --> 01:14:12.514
like, how they work, but...

01:14:13.914 --> 01:14:15.149
What is going on, okay?

01:14:15.182 --> 01:14:17.085
I mean, we just broke up

01:14:17.118 --> 01:14:18.687
and then you go meet some
random chick, and then I-

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.655
- No, it's not like that at all.

01:14:22.222 --> 01:14:24.960
Her emotions, I feel
them, like, all the time,

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:27.762
and every decision I make,
I don't know anymore,

01:14:27.795 --> 01:14:30.632
if it's my feelings
that's making me make them

01:14:30.664 --> 01:14:33.033
or if it's hers, or
if it's these powers.

01:14:33.067 --> 01:14:36.003
But, like, I just don't know
anything I'm doing anymore.

01:14:36.037 --> 01:14:39.908
And the only thing that's
kept me here and sane,

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.644
in the moment, is you.

01:14:42.676 --> 01:14:44.512
It's just you.

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:46.815
I know you, I know you're real,
and I know that I love you.

01:14:46.847 --> 01:14:48.951
And that's the only
thing I've got.

01:14:51.819 --> 01:14:53.655
You're bringing me here,

01:14:53.688 --> 01:14:55.090
telling me all about
this random chick

01:14:55.122 --> 01:14:57.224
and then you're
telling me you love me?

01:14:57.257 --> 01:14:59.760
What is going on with
you, Foster? What?

01:14:59.793 --> 01:15:01.896
Okay, Tracy, look,
I'm gonna start

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.064
- from the beginning, okay?
- Please.

01:15:03.096 --> 01:15:04.733
- I was-
- Foster.

01:15:04.765 --> 01:15:06.601
I need you to stand
up and come with me.

01:15:07.668 --> 01:15:09.170
Who the hell is he, now?

01:15:09.203 --> 01:15:11.039
I don't know. I don't know.

01:15:11.072 --> 01:15:12.940
I've never seen this guy.
Just hold on a second.

01:15:12.974 --> 01:15:13.842
Sir?

01:15:15.176 --> 01:15:17.045
I think you got
the wrong guy here.

01:15:17.078 --> 01:15:21.016
Listen, I need you to turn
around and face that wall,

01:15:21.048 --> 01:15:23.018
put your hands above your
head, and back up to-

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:24.219
- Foster.

01:15:24.252 --> 01:15:26.621
- Do what he says.
- Just hold on.

01:15:26.654 --> 01:15:28.590
Sir, I don't have
time to do that.

01:15:28.622 --> 01:15:30.291
I don't have time for this.

01:15:30.324 --> 01:15:32.927
I'm gonna need you to just go
back the way you came, okay?

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:34.863
I can't do this.

01:15:34.895 --> 01:15:36.898
Hey, you better do what
I say, do you understand?

01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:38.666
10 seconds.

01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:41.869
Sir, you really don't
want to do this with me.

01:15:41.903 --> 01:15:44.673
Now leave before I get upset.

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:47.175
I told you, put your
hands above your head

01:15:47.207 --> 01:15:48.809
and back up to me now.

01:15:48.842 --> 01:15:51.680
Foster, just do what
he ways, oh, my god.

01:15:51.712 --> 01:15:53.215
Trust me, it's okay.

01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:57.118
I'd listen
to your girlfriend, boy.

01:15:58.619 --> 01:15:59.820
Don't say I didn't warn you.

01:16:05.359 --> 01:16:06.327
Oh, way to go.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.895
Way to go, Gallagher.

01:16:09.296 --> 01:16:11.165
What the hell did
you do that for?!

01:16:11.198 --> 01:16:13.201
Well, he made it clear he
wasn't gonna come quietly.

01:16:13.234 --> 01:16:16.237
Oh, yeah, so now I got an
unconscious guy on the floor.

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:17.873
How am I gonna question him?

01:16:19.673 --> 01:16:21.743
Well, yeah, I guess his head
hit the floor pretty hard.

01:16:22.877 --> 01:16:23.979
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

01:16:24.011 --> 01:16:25.613
Yeah, yeah, that's pretty funny.

01:16:25.646 --> 01:16:27.716
Get your ass back there,
call me an ambulance,

01:16:27.748 --> 01:16:29.149
and get it out here
and get these two

01:16:29.182 --> 01:16:32.386
down to the station
now, laughing boy.

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.055
Fine.

01:16:34.087 --> 01:16:35.623
Shoot him, don't shoot him.

01:16:48.301 --> 01:16:52.106
Well, welcome back to
the land of the living.

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.643
Yeah, sorry about that.

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:56.311
My partner gets
a little excited,

01:16:56.344 --> 01:16:58.346
and he didn't think you were
gonna come along quietly

01:16:58.378 --> 01:17:01.048
so he blasted you
with his taser.

01:17:01.082 --> 01:17:03.184
You hit the ground pretty hard,

01:17:03.216 --> 01:17:05.987
like a sack of potatoes,
but the doc says

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:06.988
- you're gonna be just fine.
- Yeah.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.856
But I don't feel right.

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:12.260
What did you guys do to me?

01:17:12.292 --> 01:17:14.996
Oh, that, the doc gave
you a shot to ease the pain.

01:17:15.029 --> 01:17:16.031
Oh, Jesus.

01:17:18.399 --> 01:17:20.235
Why you looking at
me like that, son?

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:21.369
You're gonna propose?

01:17:23.837 --> 01:17:26.106
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:29.210
Look, look, you
got to let me go.

01:17:29.243 --> 01:17:30.845
Yeah, like that's
gonna happen.

01:17:30.877 --> 01:17:32.212
I got a lot of
questions to ask you.

01:17:32.246 --> 01:17:33.782
No, no, look, look.

01:17:34.748 --> 01:17:35.817
What time is it?

01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:36.951
What?

01:17:36.984 --> 01:17:38.687
How long was I out for?

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.820
- What time is it?
- I don't know, a few hours.

01:17:39.854 --> 01:17:40.954
What difference does it make?

01:17:40.988 --> 01:17:42.390
You're not going anywhere

01:17:42.422 --> 01:17:44.024
until I get all my
questions answered,

01:17:44.057 --> 01:17:45.960
so you might as well
just get comfortable.

01:17:45.993 --> 01:17:49.898
No, no, no, look, you don't
understand, I can't feel her.

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:51.832
I don't know if she's
still out or not.

01:17:51.865 --> 01:17:53.268
She could be here right now.
Look, you got to let me go.

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:55.203
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:17:55.235 --> 01:17:57.204
Look, Vera, I don't know if
she's still out or not, okay?

01:17:57.238 --> 01:17:58.840
I don't know what she'll do

01:17:58.872 --> 01:18:00.274
if she wakes up
and I'm not there.

01:18:00.307 --> 01:18:02.042
Yeah, I got this
now. This is great.

01:18:02.076 --> 01:18:03.778
- Your accomplice, right?
- Jesus Christ.

01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:04.912
- Look-
- You know what,

01:18:04.945 --> 01:18:06.381
I hope she does show up here

01:18:06.413 --> 01:18:08.015
'cause I got a lot of
questions for her too.

01:18:08.048 --> 01:18:09.384
In fact, if you
know where she is,

01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:10.719
you better come straight
with me right now.

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:12.320
Look, you don't get it.

01:18:12.353 --> 01:18:14.389
If she wakes up and she
thinks I'm in trouble,

01:18:14.421 --> 01:18:16.023
if she comes down here-

01:18:16.056 --> 01:18:18.158
- Son, what in the hell
are you talking about?

01:18:18.192 --> 01:18:20.028
Maybe the doc was wrong.

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:22.463
Maybe you hit your head a little
harder than he thinks, huh?

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.399
And you know what, I got
your other girlfriend

01:18:24.431 --> 01:18:26.134
right across the
hall, right now.

01:18:26.167 --> 01:18:28.036
And you know what, I
had little conversation

01:18:28.069 --> 01:18:30.271
with her at the diner, and she
told me that you're playing,

01:18:30.304 --> 01:18:32.273
acting, and talking crazy.

01:18:32.305 --> 01:18:34.975
So, son, are you just crazy?

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:37.811
Tracy's here?

01:18:37.845 --> 01:18:39.014
Yeah,
in the next room.

01:18:42.015 --> 01:18:43.117
Is she under arrest?

01:18:43.150 --> 01:18:45.086
No, she's not under arrest.

01:18:45.118 --> 01:18:46.954
She stayed on her own accord.

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:48.823
She wants to make sure that
you're treated properly.

01:18:48.855 --> 01:18:50.958
Okay, look, look, look, I'm
gonna tell you everything.

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.793
You got to let me talk
to Tracy right now, okay?

01:18:52.827 --> 01:18:53.962
Just let me talk to her.

01:18:55.529 --> 01:18:58.132
Listen to me, you ain't making
the rules here, son, I am.

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:00.101
Look, damn it, you
don't understand!

01:19:00.134 --> 01:19:01.935
Look, I'll tell you
about everything, okay?

01:19:01.969 --> 01:19:05.006
I'll tell you about
the tapes and Mathew.

01:19:05.038 --> 01:19:06.940
I'll tell you everything.
Just let me talk to Tracy.

01:19:06.974 --> 01:19:08.842
Just please.

01:19:13.914 --> 01:19:15.216
You stay right there.

01:19:20.154 --> 01:19:23.158
Fuck.

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.936
You keep your
butt in that seat.

01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:37.338
Are you okay?

01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:39.106
Yeah. Tracy, look,
look, I'm fine.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.975
But they told me that
you're free to go, okay?

01:19:41.007 --> 01:19:44.011
So I just need you to just
leave right now, okay?

01:19:45.979 --> 01:19:47.381
Foster, I'm here for you.

01:19:47.414 --> 01:19:49.016
No, no, look, you
don't understand.

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.150
Remember the girl that
I was telling you about?

01:19:50.184 --> 01:19:51.152
Look, I can't feel her, okay?

01:19:51.185 --> 01:19:52.554
Don't know where she is,

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:53.888
and you can't be here
when she shows up,

01:19:53.921 --> 01:19:55.256
so I just need you to leave

01:19:55.288 --> 01:19:57.090
because you're
just not safe here.

01:19:57.123 --> 01:19:58.926
She's in the safest
place she could be.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.862
No, she isn't.

01:20:00.895 --> 01:20:02.497
The safest place for her is as
far away from me as possible.

01:20:02.529 --> 01:20:04.064
You need to leave right now.

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.268
I think you hit your head
harder than the doctor-

01:20:07.301 --> 01:20:09.137
- Damn it! Tracy,
listen to me, okay?

01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:12.940
Look, look, I love you, but
you can't be here, okay?

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:14.375
You've got to go right now

01:20:14.408 --> 01:20:15.410
and just get far away
from me as you can.

01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:16.344
Just go!

01:20:17.244 --> 01:20:18.078
God.

01:20:18.112 --> 01:20:19.346
Tracy.

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:20.949
Tracy.

01:20:20.981 --> 01:20:22.382
Is he always like this,

01:20:22.416 --> 01:20:24.219
or do I need to call
the doc back in here?

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:26.020
No, sir.

01:20:26.052 --> 01:20:28.055
No, he might be an asshole,
but he's not a liar.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:30.557
He really believes
what he's saying.

01:20:30.591 --> 01:20:32.193
I really do, Tracy, so please,

01:20:32.225 --> 01:20:33.560
just go right now
and just leave.

01:20:33.594 --> 01:20:34.863
Just get out of here.

01:20:36.029 --> 01:20:37.364
What the hell was that?

01:20:37.398 --> 01:20:39.000
Gallagher, check that out.

01:20:39.033 --> 01:20:40.201
No, no, no,
no, no, don't. Don't go!

01:20:40.234 --> 01:20:41.403
Shut up. Check it out.

01:20:44.939 --> 01:20:46.341
You better calm him
down, you understand me?

01:20:46.373 --> 01:20:48.909
Hey,
how'd you get back here?

01:20:50.377 --> 01:20:52.880
Hey, hey,
hey, stop right there!

01:20:52.913 --> 01:20:55.048
Shut up!

01:21:02.122 --> 01:21:03.523
I know, it's okay.

01:21:03.556 --> 01:21:05.260
Oh, my god, I woke up
and you weren't there,

01:21:05.292 --> 01:21:06.960
and I was wondering
where you were.

01:21:06.993 --> 01:21:08.095
- I know, it's okay.
- I didn't know

01:21:08.128 --> 01:21:09.229
- where you were.
- It's okay.

01:21:09.262 --> 01:21:10.364
I didn't know where you were.

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:11.565
I know, I know, it's okay.

01:21:11.599 --> 01:21:12.900
- It's okay.
- Foster!

01:21:12.934 --> 01:21:14.034
I could feel that something...

01:21:14.068 --> 01:21:15.470
What is going on?!

01:21:15.502 --> 01:21:17.171
It's okay, it's
okay, it's okay.

01:21:18.372 --> 01:21:20.240
Who is that?

01:21:20.274 --> 01:21:22.143
She was trying to help me.
Look, look, get the keys.

01:21:22.176 --> 01:21:23.544
Get the keys from there
and unlock my hands, okay?

01:21:23.577 --> 01:21:24.979
It's okay. Just here,
unlock me, please.

01:21:30.451 --> 01:21:32.052
Okay, thank you.

01:21:32.086 --> 01:21:33.253
Now just get the hell
out of here, all right?

01:21:33.287 --> 01:21:35.023
- Just go!
- No, I don't understand

01:21:35.055 --> 01:21:35.923
- what's going on!
- Look, just leave, okay?

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:37.191
- Just go.
- No!

01:21:37.224 --> 01:21:38.293
- Get out!
- Yeah, yeah, go, go.

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:39.293
- Just go now.
- No!

01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:40.028
I don't understand.

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:40.461
Wait.

01:21:41.729 --> 01:21:42.597
Wait.

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:44.932
Wait. I can feel it.

01:21:48.502 --> 01:21:49.604
You love her.

01:21:49.636 --> 01:21:50.537
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:52.372
Look, look, no.

01:21:52.405 --> 01:21:54.708
This, this is the woman?!

01:21:54.742 --> 01:21:56.144
No, no, don't!

01:21:58.311 --> 01:21:59.247
Vera, no!

01:21:59.279 --> 01:22:00.380
Why?!

01:22:00.413 --> 01:22:01.715
She did this to you, Foster!

01:22:01.748 --> 01:22:03.283
I would have never had done

01:22:03.317 --> 01:22:05.086
- this to you!
- Vera!

01:22:05.118 --> 01:22:05.953
- You've done enough!
- I would have stopped them!

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:06.954
You saved me!

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:08.523
You saved me. It's over!

01:22:08.555 --> 01:22:10.023
It's over, Vera.

01:22:10.056 --> 01:22:11.059
No.

01:22:11.091 --> 01:22:12.092
No.

01:22:12.126 --> 01:22:13.226
No, I have to kill her!

01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.529
I have to kill her!

01:22:14.561 --> 01:22:16.029
- Don't!
- You'll leave me!

01:22:16.063 --> 01:22:17.332
- Stop it!
- You will leave me

01:22:17.364 --> 01:22:19.934
- like they all always do!
- Vera, stop!

01:22:27.341 --> 01:22:28.209
Hey.

01:22:33.613 --> 01:22:35.082
It's okay. Stop.

01:22:36.082 --> 01:22:38.385
Look, I just...

01:22:38.418 --> 01:22:40.654
I love you, not her, okay?

01:22:42.456 --> 01:22:44.559
You're feeling it all wrong.

01:22:44.591 --> 01:22:48.695
They gave me these drugs
and they made me so tired.

01:22:48.729 --> 01:22:51.566
And I just want to go.

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:52.701
Let's just go.

01:22:57.203 --> 01:22:58.472
You love me?

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:02.043
Of course I do, you know that.

01:23:02.076 --> 01:23:03.610
I know that.

01:23:03.644 --> 01:23:05.713
We've got the
connection, not her.

01:23:07.113 --> 01:23:08.682
Let's just get out of here.

01:23:11.385 --> 01:23:12.253
Okay.

01:23:15.722 --> 01:23:17.391
But what about her?

01:23:20.327 --> 01:23:21.563
What about her?

01:23:23.564 --> 01:23:26.034
We can't leave any witnesses.

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:28.301
Who's gonna believe her, Vera?

01:23:28.335 --> 01:23:31.538
Besides, look, if
you leave her alive,

01:23:31.572 --> 01:23:34.275
she's gonna always know she
got thrown away for you.

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:37.045
Come on.

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:39.014
Come on, let's just go.

01:23:39.712 --> 01:23:41.048
Let's just go.

01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:14.547
