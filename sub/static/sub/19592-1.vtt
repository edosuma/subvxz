Innocent blood,

03:01.482 --> 03:03.415

Okay, lady, please.
I gotta go.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.272
What button am I pressing?

05:07.274 --> 05:08.840
No, you just hold it,
it's already on.

05:10.144 --> 05:13.445
Here I am in union station.
Finally made it to la.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.347
Hi, dad.
So excited!

05:20.486 --> 05:24.323
So, I'm on
the famous 101 freeway.

05:24.325 --> 05:28.060
And I understand now
why it's so famous.

05:28.062 --> 05:30.162
Looks like the traffic's
finally starting to move.

05:30.164 --> 05:31.830
We should be there soon.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.533
Oh, this is my cab driver Dave.
Say hi, Dave!

05:34.535 --> 05:35.701
Yeah, hi.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.502
He's pretty much
the best driver ever.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.072
Oh my god! Is that Melrose?!
I heard of that.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.574
Hey, Dave, do you know where
any famous people live?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.509
Lady, I don't care
about famous people.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.978
Oh, come on Dave,

05:46.980 --> 05:48.180
You telling me you never, like,

05:48.182 --> 05:51.383
gave a famous person a ride
or something before?

05:51.385 --> 05:53.318
Hey, do you have
any celebrity friends?

05:53.320 --> 05:55.487
No. It's my cab, my wife
and that's it.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.422
Oh, come on,
there has to be someone.

05:57.424 --> 05:59.991
What about Miley?
Have you see Miley Cyrus?

05:59.993 --> 06:02.194
I don't watch baseball.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.662
Thank you, Dave!

06:03.664 --> 06:05.664
You're the best cab guy
in the world!

06:05.666 --> 06:07.632
- Girl!

06:08.836 --> 06:10.869
You made it!
How was the trip?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.704
It was good.
You look great!

06:12.706 --> 06:14.606
I know!
You do, too.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.208
What's with
this whole camera thing?

06:16.210 --> 06:18.577
Filming the whole trip?
- Of course!

06:18.579 --> 06:20.212
Spielbergerella.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.646
Okay, thank you.

06:21.648 --> 06:22.881
Yo, no, dude,

06:22.883 --> 06:25.050
aren't you gonna
help us with those bags,
up this hill?

06:25.052 --> 06:25.050
No way.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.553
I just tipped him
like three dollars.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.921
Naw, naw, man.
Come on, hey!

06:29.923 --> 06:31.556
What the hell, Dave?!

06:31.558 --> 06:33.592
Dude, can you believe
that terrorist?

06:33.594 --> 06:33.592
I know!

06:33.594 --> 06:37.929
Who makes girls carry luggage
up a steep ass hill like this?

06:37.931 --> 06:39.698
Welcome to la.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.367
Dude, you brought
a butt-load of luggage.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.569
Yeah, but I'm gonna be here
for like a month.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.638
A month, not a decade.

06:46.640 --> 06:50.609
Okay, I've seen you travel
with way more stuff than this.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.311
- Fuck this.
I am taking the camera.
- No! Wait!

06:53.313 --> 06:54.413
Is this it?

06:54.415 --> 06:55.714
Yep. Go on in.

06:58.851 --> 06:58.850
Hey, y'all!

06:58.852 --> 07:02.287
This is my cousin
from n'Orleans
i was tellin' y'all about.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.455
Hi, cousin from New Orleans.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.756
Hi, guys.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.091
My bitches.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.793
Hey, come drink with us, babe.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.294
Yeah, just let me get her
settled in right quick.

07:09.296 --> 07:09.294
Okay.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.097
Hey, can you bring the radio?
My phone died.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.465
All right.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.269
They're nice.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.304
Yeah, if you're into
pervs and hos.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.574
Nice, cuz!

07:22.576 --> 07:24.643
Yep, this is the palace--
oh, yeah, go ahead.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.278
Just drop your fucking shit,
Dani, that's cool.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.581
Oh, man.
I can get used to this!

07:29.583 --> 07:32.083
Don't. Your dad made me promise
i wouldn't keep you.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.318
Whatchya readin'?

07:33.320 --> 07:35.654
I don't read, you tard.
That's my stash.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.189
Oh.

07:37.191 --> 07:40.292
You're actin' like you don't
know your fucking cousin.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.794
Is that how you do it here?
Just leave it
right on the coffee table?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.963
Welcome to California, baby.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.233
Oh, this is cute!
I'm gonna take this.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.269
Here for five minutes
and you're stealing my shit.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.871
Let's go see what else
looks good on me.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.372
Klepto.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.241
Oh, shit!

07:56.542 --> 07:58.276
Uh, art?

07:58.278 --> 08:00.679
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.148
Oh, that's Trey's room.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.449
I'd steer clear of that
if I were you.

08:04.451 --> 08:05.851
Charming.

08:05.853 --> 08:09.187
Yeah, he's into cute babies
and dead things like that.

08:09.189 --> 08:12.457
And that is my room.
That's where
all the magic happens.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.960
Mm, nice.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.561
Exactly as I pictured it.

08:16.563 --> 08:17.896
I know, right?

08:17.898 --> 08:20.298
I think I should be like an
interior designer or somethin'.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.368
What the hell are you doing
with voodoo beads, crazy?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.136
I had this boy who decided
to cheat on me

08:25.138 --> 08:27.138
so I figured voodoo curse.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.241
Shit didn't work though,
damn it.

08:29.243 --> 08:32.677
Yeah, I'm kind of going through
that myself, actually.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.645
Oh, god.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.648
This would be the dinin' room.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.650
Slash hoarders paradise.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.085
Okay, that's all the band shit.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.520
We're gonna need that
when we're one of
the greatest bands ever.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.455
Naturally.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.892
That's our studio there
on the right.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.159
Oh, wow!

08:48.161 --> 08:49.394
It's like my sanctuary.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.763
That's where I like to go
and, you know, reflect.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.331
I'm a very angry person, Dani.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.100
Oh, is that what it is?

08:57.270 --> 08:58.770
This place is huge.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.972
Your ass is huge.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.576
Oh, miss Donna.

09:04.578 --> 09:05.944
She misses you.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.113
And she always will.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.584
Oh, I like this one.
Who's is this?

09:12.586 --> 09:15.086
It's all yours, kiddo.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.622
It took me four fucking days
to clean this place.

09:17.624 --> 09:18.490
I get my own room?

09:19.759 --> 09:23.028
Holy shit, I thought for sure
I'd be staying on the couch!

09:23.030 --> 09:25.063
And you get your own bathroom.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.565
Don't you dare go using mine.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.533
I'm super anal
about my bathroom.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.268
Ba dum ch.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.103
Yes, I got lines.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.772
Are you happy, Princess?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.674
Maybe a little.

09:36.943 --> 09:38.977
Oh, yeah.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.913
This feels so good.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.516
Try stayin' on a train
for three fuckin' days.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.952
Well maybe...

09:46.954 --> 09:49.254
...somebody should've taken
a plane like I told them to.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.090
Ah, well maybe I like trains.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.592
Did you bring a bathing suit?

09:53.594 --> 09:56.261
Yeah. Who doesn't bring
a bathing suit to California?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.897
Stupid n'Orleans bitches
like you.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.434
I can't believe
I'm finally here!

10:02.436 --> 10:04.336
Only took you
two fuckin' years.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.905
I know, I'm sorry.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.342
It's just things were
so crazy back home and...

10:10.344 --> 10:11.977
...and then work
was driving me nuts,

10:11.979 --> 10:13.812
and then
that whole thing happened...

10:13.814 --> 10:15.814
Blah blah blah blah blah.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.415
Just put your swim suit on.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.250
You'll be over that douche
in 24 hours.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.486
You're too good to me, cuz!

10:26.258 --> 10:28.360
No, don't! No!

10:28.362 --> 10:29.928
No!

10:29.930 --> 10:31.663
Say hi, bitch.

10:33.032 --> 10:33.031
You up for a drink?

10:33.033 --> 10:36.301
- Um, Jack? How 'bout Jack?
- You should go get us drinks.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.004
Oh! That's pure vodka,
fuck face.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.472
Hey, how long ya here for?

10:40.474 --> 10:41.673
Uh, 'til the 28th.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.174
No, you should stay
'til Halloween,

10:43.176 --> 10:44.442
because then we can go to weho

10:44.444 --> 10:45.744
and you can see
the crazy costumes.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.179
- Weho?
- Yes, it's so fun.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.382
- What's weho?
- Okay, no. Well, first off--

10:52.219 --> 10:53.785
Weho is west Hollywood.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.187
Halloween is so much better
in n'Orleans.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.890
- No, that's true.
New Orleans Halloween--
- who says "nawlins"?

10:58.892 --> 11:01.359
You wish you sounded
as good as us!

11:01.361 --> 11:03.595
I was there for mardi gras
a few years ago.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.230
So fun!

11:05.232 --> 11:07.365
Oh, my god.
I love mardi gras.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.901
You, sweetheart, love
showing those tits off.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.569
Hey! She did it for the beads.

11:11.571 --> 11:12.971
There's nothing wrong
with that.

11:12.973 --> 11:16.307
It's kind of true.
I would do anything
for the beads.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.510
I mean mardi gras girls
are fucking insane.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.845
Think about it, no daddies
stifling their creativity.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.881
Titties, titties, more titties.

11:22.883 --> 11:26.084
Yeah, no, these girls seriously
come from all over the world

11:26.086 --> 11:27.686
just to whip their boobs
all over town.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.987
I mean, it's nutty.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.589
Yeah, but I heard
if a guy whips out his dick

11:31.591 --> 11:33.758
then he goes to jail.
What's that about?

11:33.760 --> 11:35.026
The bad guys go to jail.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.695
Because nobody wants
to see a bunch of guys

11:36.697 --> 11:38.263
whipping their dicks out.
- Bullshit!

11:41.535 --> 11:43.068
Trey! Trey! Trey!

11:43.070 --> 11:44.502
Boys, boys, it's only five P.M.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.905
Don't gotta start getting gay
on me now.
Stop it.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.173
Too soon?

11:48.175 --> 11:49.708
Okay, wait, I have a question.

11:49.710 --> 11:53.278
So stace, so this one
and this one that's the band?

11:53.280 --> 11:56.414
Bandmates, and these beautiful
ladies are my co-tenders!

11:56.416 --> 11:58.283
- Whoo!
- Co-tenders?

11:58.285 --> 12:00.385
Trey!

12:00.387 --> 12:02.120
Keep it in the pants.
- False alarm.

12:02.122 --> 12:05.056
Wait, so what is-what is
this so-called band called?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.158
- Rapeseed!
- Rapeseed forever!

12:07.160 --> 12:10.228
Rapeseed?
I will not be seeing that.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.397
I'm a little scared.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.432
So anyways, what are you gonna
be doing while you're here?

12:14.434 --> 12:16.901
I dunno, ask that one.
She's the one in charge.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.269
To start off with,

12:18.271 --> 12:19.471
we are going
to Hollywood blvd tonight.

12:19.473 --> 12:20.472
We are not doing you tonight.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.273
We are going
to Hollywood blvd tonight,

12:22.275 --> 12:23.441
and then we are going
to the rainbow.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.743
Ooh, love the rainbow.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.144
Rainbow's cool.
You're gonna like that.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.579
Not the gay bar rainbow.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.953
Oh, my god! You guys should
come out with us tonight!

12:34.955 --> 12:37.388
Oh, no, we're going
to Vegas tonight!

12:37.390 --> 12:38.757
Yeah!

12:38.759 --> 12:40.959
Vegas?
You're still going to Vegas?

12:44.898 --> 12:47.332
Okay, so tell us
some good Stacy stories.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.666
You can shut your mouth.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.668
Like there's not enough
of those going around!

12:50.670 --> 12:52.303
I've got a few of those!

12:52.305 --> 12:54.906
I know there's
some deep down secrets
you ain't telling us about.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.608
Deep down secrets!

12:57.744 --> 13:01.012
No, she looks sweet,
but once you get to know her...

13:01.014 --> 13:02.781
So, is that just a front,
the sweetness, or...

13:02.783 --> 13:05.016
Hey! Shut up!
You see what I have
to live with?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.584
Oh, yeah, what you
gotta live with, huh?

13:10.991 --> 13:14.492
Oh! Two!
It's always better than one.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.496
Whoo!

13:18.498 --> 13:21.166
Ooh, look at me!
I'm walking on famous people!

13:21.168 --> 13:23.168
It's the walk of fame, moron.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.136
Look! We have one of those
back home!

13:27.740 --> 13:29.073
Whoo!

13:29.075 --> 13:30.875
There she is,

13:30.877 --> 13:33.311
The hottest thing this town
has ever seen.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.846
Oh, this is nice!

13:34.848 --> 13:37.182
Hey, was mann really Chinese?

13:37.184 --> 13:39.617
Dani, whose hands are those?

13:39.619 --> 13:41.085

13:41.087 --> 13:42.887
She found her, uncle Johnny.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.489
Hi, daddy!

13:44.491 --> 13:46.324
Who's next to her?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.959
I don't know who that is.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.561
Jane Russell.

13:49.563 --> 13:50.795
She's not as cool.

13:50.797 --> 13:54.499
You don't, who Jane Russell is,

13:54.501 --> 13:57.535
Um, she's not Marilyn,
i know that.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.638
Ooh, Kevin costner,
he's so hot.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.173
Ooh, Hannibal!

14:02.175 --> 14:06.177
"I'm having
an old friend for dinner."

14:06.179 --> 14:10.348
Stacy's got doors-dar
so of course
she found them right quick.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.816
Yay, you found him, whoo.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.651
Let's get outta here,

14:13.653 --> 14:16.087
Stop with the horns.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.258
Take it to the head, cuz.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.562
Oh, that's so strong.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.763
What?

14:25.765 --> 14:29.534
It's that californ-i-a

14:29.536 --> 14:31.035
Hand that over here.
- Yep.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.670
Here, give me that.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.876
I think I'm already stoned.
- Don't smoke in the cab.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.010
Okay, stace,

14:39.012 --> 14:40.478
he's gonna roll on us.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.513
Whatever, officer.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.649
Roll down the window.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.719
Stacy, oh, my god, stop.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.220
We're seriously
going to prison.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.822
Ha!

14:51.156 --> 14:52.490
Okay.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.627
Aw, yeah.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.866
Stace!

15:01.868 --> 15:04.168
Would you quit
walking so fast?

15:04.170 --> 15:07.538
I'm just-
I'm fucking paranoid right now.

15:09.174 --> 15:13.278
Dude. Insane.
Your eyes are fucking glassy.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.314
I'm so stoned!

15:16.316 --> 15:17.815
What have I done?

15:22.087 --> 15:23.488
It's your first day
in Hollywood.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.789
Are you stoked or what?

15:24.791 --> 15:27.859
Oh, my god, I love it.
Love, love, love it.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.627
Oh, my god, it's Ron Jeremy.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.396
What? Where?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.597
Ladies.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.633
Hi, how are you?
I'm Ron.

15:35.635 --> 15:36.935
Hi. I'm Dani.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.469
Nice to meet you, Dani.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.138
You know,
you're very pretty.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.639
Here.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.775
Take my card.
Gimme a call.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.945
I have something
you might be interested in.

15:46.947 --> 15:50.481
Um, okay, i-i will do that.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.685
Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

15:53.687 --> 15:55.820
- [Stacy bye bye, Ronnie.
- Bye bye.

15:55.822 --> 15:56.955
Oh, my god.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.657
Ron Jeremy just made you
his concubine.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.193
He has the biggest whore-dar
in the world

16:02.195 --> 16:04.295
and he came and talked to you.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.098
What does that say?

16:07.100 --> 16:08.333
Fuck you.

16:09.168 --> 16:11.869
This place is trippy.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.639
I feel like
I'm in pantera's basement
or something.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.108
Dude, I totally
brought this guy here once.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.544
Never talked to me again.
Fucker.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.012
Shocker.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.147
Speaking of that, what's
up with you and Spencer?

16:23.149 --> 16:24.182
Nothing.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.150
Nothing serious,
we're just friends.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.852
No, you know what?

16:27.854 --> 16:29.954
Dani, you tell me all about
what's going on with you.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.490
Tell me everything about frank.
- Oh, god.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.625
What a fucking asshole.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.894
He told me he was single. No.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.197
He ended up being married
the whole fucking time.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.732
- No way.
- Uh-huh.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.166
And then his wife

16:42.168 --> 16:45.570
ended up being like some voodoo
priestess or some shit.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.572
- Get the f--
- yeah, get this.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.407
She comes to my work.
- Your work?!

16:49.409 --> 16:51.309
Uh-huh!
You can believe this bitch?

16:51.311 --> 16:55.313
She comes to my work and starts
cursing and screaming at me

16:55.315 --> 16:58.049
in some, like,
some weird language.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.884
Telling me how I fucked up
her home.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.652
- Just fuck that bitch.
- I know.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.888
You're such a jezebel.

17:03.890 --> 17:07.925
- Fuck you.
-  - I'm gonna start calling you jezzy.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.060
Hmm.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.162
That was it, though.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.997
I mean,
i bought my ticket here.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.599
I just had to get out of there.
You know?

17:17.336 --> 17:20.637
That's really shitty, Dani.
I'm sorry.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.073
It's all right.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.108
I fell in love with him,
though.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.244
That's the part that sucks.

17:28.446 --> 17:31.716
And his wife man,
she was so scary.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.384
I mean,

17:33.386 --> 17:34.752
you know, I don't-
i don't believe

17:34.754 --> 17:36.287
in that kind of like
voodoo stuff,

17:36.289 --> 17:38.689
but there was something a
bout her, man.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.225
- What?
- She tripped me the fuck out.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.860
Just 'cause she showed up
to your work?

17:42.862 --> 17:46.230
No, no. It was like-
it was like what she was doing.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.965
I mean, she-she started, like,

17:47.967 --> 17:49.367
speaking in
this weird language,

17:49.369 --> 17:52.236
then her eyes started rolling
in the back of her head.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.605
I mean,it was nuts.
Don't look at me that way!

17:54.607 --> 17:57.075
Trust me, it was scary.
You would've been scared, too.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.376
I'm sure it was, Dani.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.611
But you realize that none
of that, none of that is real.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.113
Yeah, yeah.

18:02.981 --> 18:06.451
But you know people back home,
i mean...

18:06.453 --> 18:08.553
...everyone's superstitious.

18:08.555 --> 18:13.458
I mean, you start to kinda buy
into it after a little while.

18:13.460 --> 18:17.595
Plus, you know,
my mom dying and stuff.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.131
It was all just kinda playing
on me at the same time.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.266
How you doing with that, kiddo?
Are you okay?

18:22.268 --> 18:25.002
Hmm, yeah, I mean,

18:25.004 --> 18:27.305
good as can be expected, right?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.474
Is that the necklace
she gave you?

18:29.476 --> 18:30.541
Yeah.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.444
Kind of makes me feel like
she's always a part of me,

18:33.446 --> 18:34.512
you know?

18:35.681 --> 18:37.115
You were always closer
to your mom than I was.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.683
Sorry I didn't make
the services, Dani.

18:38.685 --> 18:39.817
Naw, it's all right.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.219
You know what? No.
We are not doing this.

18:41.221 --> 18:44.355
This is your vacation.
We're gonna have some fun.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.491
- Okay.
- Talk about good things,
happy things.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.192
All right. You first.

18:48.194 --> 18:51.929
Um, you know,
we should get some Jack.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.531
- Jack? No.
- Jack. Yes.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.999
Are you out of your damn mind?

18:55.001 --> 18:56.267
I am always out
of my damn mind.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.870
But we are having some Jack
and it is happening.

18:58.872 --> 19:00.605
I fucking hate you.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.340
Are you really
gonna make me do this?
- Oh, yeah.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.275
- All right, here we go.
- Cheers.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.781
That's...

19:10.783 --> 19:13.918
That's the face
i was looking for!

19:13.920 --> 19:16.287
- I hate you.
- Oh, you can hate me.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.322
But you'll love me when
it hits you in the morning.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.492
Right now, it's dance time.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.494
- Dance!
- Dance time!

19:35.974 --> 19:38.075
You're clinically insane, child.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.677
You need help.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.745
Why?

19:40.747 --> 19:43.648
I'm taking you home,
and putting you to bed.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.284
Oh yeah, 'cause you never
stripped at a bar. Okay.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.986
Yo, yo, yo!
Where you ladies
headed tonight?

19:48.988 --> 19:50.254
Oh, god.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.323
He's cute. What?

19:54.793 --> 19:55.860
Ugh.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.229
Why do these fuckin' cab guys

19:58.231 --> 20:01.165
keep makin' us walk
up this hill?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.401
Because they suck.

20:04.469 --> 20:05.770
Next time,

20:05.772 --> 20:09.540
we're not getting out
'til they take us all the way.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.075
Fo shiz.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.377
What's that?

20:13.379 --> 20:14.612
Did you hear that?

20:22.554 --> 20:23.854
Hello?

20:24.957 --> 20:26.424
Hello?

20:26.426 --> 20:27.792
Dani, don't go over there!

20:27.794 --> 20:29.860
Just give me a second.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.671
- Oh, my god!
- You assholes!

20:40.673 --> 20:42.907
- Oh, we got you both.
- Oh, my god, you did.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.275
That was so good!

20:44.277 --> 20:45.776
All his idea.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.578
I am the creative one
in the relationship.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.014
You're both dead, and that
little one has to go to bed.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.148
- No!
- What?

20:51.150 --> 20:53.417
This little lady
just got here, mom...

20:53.419 --> 20:54.719
- Yeah!
- ...So hook up.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.120
She always tries
to keep me chained!

20:56.122 --> 20:57.588
Let's get this camera
outta here real quick.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.756
Oh, I like this thing.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.591
You've seen our house.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.326
I was gonna
take her for a walk.

21:02.328 --> 21:03.661
- Ooh, yes, yes, yes.
- No, no.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.296
Mommy, can I please
go for a walk?

21:05.298 --> 21:07.131
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.500
- No.
- We can hang out,
they can hang out.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.171
- Okay fine, you can go.
- Yay!

21:14.173 --> 21:16.307
I get to do big girl things!

21:17.109 --> 21:18.576
Not to worry, stace.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.578
I'll protect her
from these dangerous
Hollywood hills types.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.480
- Yes, you will.
- Dani!

21:23.282 --> 21:25.316
How was the rainbow tonight?

21:25.318 --> 21:27.985
It was good!
It was, um...

21:27.987 --> 21:31.656
Well, we-we ran into
Ron Jeremy, the porn actor.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.991
Um, he gave me his card.

21:33.993 --> 21:34.925
That's cool...

21:36.194 --> 21:39.196
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- ...And scary,
all at the same time.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.002
Man, this camera is like
fucking ridiculous.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.537
Most people
just use their phones.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.005
I know. My, uh...

21:48.007 --> 21:49.440
... my dad found it for me

21:49.442 --> 21:51.842
right before I came out here
to film my trip.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.679
Your dad?
Wow, that's sweet.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.380
I love my daddy.

21:56.382 --> 21:57.848
I love him, too.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.550
So you're a filmmaker?

21:59.552 --> 22:01.519
Oh, yeah,
I'm thinking about it.

22:01.521 --> 22:02.787
I mean, right now I'm just,

22:02.789 --> 22:05.556
um, working
as an account executive,

22:05.558 --> 22:06.957
but you never know.

22:08.293 --> 22:10.961
Well, might as well start now.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.397
Yeah, but I mean, I have
to wait a little while.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.166
Waiting sucks. Fuck waiting.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.400
Waiting does suck.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.336
- I hate waiting. Right?
- I hate waiting.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.766
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.735
- No, I just-i just...
- What's wrong?

22:50.737 --> 22:53.604
...can't do this right now.
I'm sorry.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.873
I know, I...
- We were so close!

22:55.875 --> 22:56.907
It's not you.

22:56.909 --> 23:00.044
I got out of a really,
really bad recently...

23:00.046 --> 23:01.178
I thought so.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.513
...and, um...

23:02.515 --> 23:03.948
...thought I wanted this,
but I just-

23:03.950 --> 23:05.349
I don't think I'm ready yet.

23:05.351 --> 23:07.184
Yeah, well...

23:07.186 --> 23:09.387
But, you know,
I'm gonna be here for weeks,

23:09.389 --> 23:11.856
so maybe I'll feel differently
on Thursday,

23:11.858 --> 23:14.592
so just wait a little.
- I understand.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.695
We hate waiting.
We talked about this.
- I know we do.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.196
But um, yeah, I'm just-

23:19.198 --> 23:21.432
I'm gonna go
make sure Stacy's okay.

23:22.434 --> 23:23.734
Ah, come on!

23:25.404 --> 23:27.638
Watch as the dirty slut

23:27.640 --> 23:31.308
begins the mating process
with her unaware prey.

23:33.979 --> 23:37.448
Uh, I hate to interrupt,
but I'm going to bed now.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.350
Good night, guys.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.787
Aw, you were such a cute kid.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.522
What the hell happened?

23:45.257 --> 23:46.857
I'm gonna fuck with her.

23:48.194 --> 23:51.996
Oh, my god.
This is the scariest house
I've ever been in.

23:51.998 --> 23:55.299
Who the fuck has this shit
in their house?

23:55.301 --> 23:56.834
Goddamn it.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.270
Ugh.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.507
And in we go!

24:05.445 --> 24:10.047
Oh, goddamn,
she is so fucking messy.

24:11.283 --> 24:15.152
Let's see...
What do we have here?

24:18.623 --> 24:20.758
Could use a decorator. Ooh!

24:20.760 --> 24:24.495
There we go, mama like.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.598
Thank you.

24:28.867 --> 24:31.135
Sorry, stace, but...

24:32.537 --> 24:33.938
...you deserve it.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.008
It's play time.

25:12.110 --> 25:13.544
Okay...

25:16.681 --> 25:19.416
I'm still a little wasted.

25:19.418 --> 25:22.887
I drank just a little bit more
than I should've, but...

25:22.889 --> 25:25.155
...that's what vacations
are for.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.824
Sorry, daddy.

25:27.926 --> 25:31.762
Anyways, it was a great
first day here in sunny c.A.

25:31.764 --> 25:35.199
And tomorrow we're going
to the beach.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.769
I think she said venice,
which is awesome.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.804
I've always wanted to go there.

25:41.606 --> 25:44.341
The doors, baby, yeah.

25:44.343 --> 25:47.144
It's where Jim and Pam
met first, I think.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.848
Anyways, I'm tired, so...

25:50.850 --> 25:52.850
...I'm gonna go to sleep, but...

25:53.618 --> 25:55.452
I love you, daddy.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.187
I hope you're okay.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.156
Good night.

26:01.294 --> 26:03.694
Oh, I think I hit
the night vision button.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.262
Okay.

26:05.264 --> 26:06.764
For real this time.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.132
Night, daddy.

26:13.972 --> 26:15.506
That's it! See?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.008
Big sign that says "venice."

26:18.010 --> 26:20.244
Yay, we made it!

26:20.246 --> 26:22.279
Hey, I really gotta pee.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.948
Should I just, like,
pee in the ocean?

26:23.950 --> 26:25.382
Ew, Dani!

26:26.251 --> 26:28.085
Dude, you're gonna
love this place.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.621
It's full of transient
psychopaths like ourselves.

26:30.623 --> 26:32.790
Ugh, I'm so hung over.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.124
You know the best cure
for that?

26:34.126 --> 26:35.726
Uh, more booze?

26:36.461 --> 26:37.795
Exactly.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.463
- Oh, me god.
- Voila!

26:39.465 --> 26:41.332
Oh, okay, gimme the camera.
- Take it.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.101
Gimme your camera.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.904
All right. You better taste
my bomb bloody Mary,

26:46.906 --> 26:49.440
'cause I make
the bombest bloody marries.

26:49.442 --> 26:50.774
Oh, that is so good.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.510
I know! And it looks like juice

26:53.512 --> 26:55.079
so the po-po don't even know.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.680
- You're a genius.
- I know.

26:56.682 --> 26:57.681
Let's go.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.752
Why is it so crowded?

27:01.754 --> 27:03.520
Welcome to venice.

27:05.156 --> 27:06.824
It's kinda dead, actually.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.864
Is that your new dance moves,
Dani?

27:15.701 --> 27:18.302
I think he's gonna try
to jump over everyone.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.737
Yeah, that's exciting stuff.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.305
Come on, let's go.
I wanna go.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.007
Go down the beach.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.113
Holy shit! It's so cold!

27:29.115 --> 27:30.547
- Get your ass back in there.
 - It's like ice!

27:30.549 --> 27:31.949
You do it!
- What did you do--

27:31.951 --> 27:33.617
this is how it's done.

27:33.619 --> 27:36.020
Oh, my god, she's nuckin' futs!

27:36.022 --> 27:38.022
Hey, they say mental illness
is hereditary!

27:38.024 --> 27:39.857
Oh, yeah! See?!

27:39.859 --> 27:42.126
Wait, hey!
What'd you do to my camera?

27:42.128 --> 27:43.894
You turned the exposure
all the way up.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.095
Don't play
with things you don't--

28:13.191 --> 28:15.059
Um, hi!

28:17.195 --> 28:19.963
Dude, we ain't got no money.
Move on.

28:22.233 --> 28:23.834
He's kinda creeping me out.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.869
Just give him some change
or something.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.871
Dude, seriously, why you
creeping on young girls?

28:27.873 --> 28:29.840
- Stace.
- No.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.176
Seriously, dude.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.844
Get outta here. Leave.

28:34.579 --> 28:35.879
Now!

28:36.247 --> 28:37.848
He's sorry.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.383
He should be sorry.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.085
Have a good day, buddy.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.022
That's sad.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.423
He's just off is meds.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.293
Kinda gettin' hungry.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.994
- Go get somethin'.
- Are you sure?

28:50.996 --> 28:52.529
Yeah. It's fine.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.198
Okay, I'll be back.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.699
Okeedokee.

29:23.394 --> 29:25.796
Stace, let's go walk around.

29:25.798 --> 29:27.631
The boardwalk's really cool.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.068
Stacy!

29:46.952 --> 29:48.786
Fuck man!

29:48.788 --> 29:50.988
Jesus Christ!

29:52.223 --> 29:53.023
Was I sleeping?

29:54.159 --> 29:56.226
Dude, I was only gone
for, like, 20 minutes.

29:56.228 --> 29:58.495
Come on!
Let's go walk around.

29:58.497 --> 29:59.930
Coming.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.233
Kick your ass for that.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.603
Dude, we can go and get
a tattoo right here.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.705
I am not getting
a tattoo, crazy.

30:08.707 --> 30:11.341
- Why not?
- My dad would kill me.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.810
More Sage.

30:12.812 --> 30:18.215
I'm telling you, I really think
we should Sage the whole house.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.717
I think you're just paranoid
and have--

30:20.719 --> 30:23.220
you're not back home, anymore.
It's not always hot.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.391
Ooh, Stacy, a psychic!

30:27.393 --> 30:28.892
Dani, no.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.160
Ten bucks?!

30:30.162 --> 30:33.497
I can just call my cousin
and see one for free.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.832
- Yo, kiddo, look at those.
-  - Hello.

30:34.834 --> 30:37.034
- These are nice.
-  - These rocks are beautiful.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.069
- Hello.
- Hi.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.171
- Hi, how are ya?
- Oh, hello, hello.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.240
- These are pretty.
- Oh...

30:43.242 --> 30:45.576
They are good
for <i> la protection.</i>

30:45.578 --> 30:46.743
- For the protection?
- You need these.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.212
Yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, I need these.

30:48.214 --> 30:51.081
Yes. You should try this.
Yes, yes, yes.

30:51.083 --> 30:54.551
This good for the soul.
- Oh.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.822
I think I'm-I'm good, though.
I just wanted to look.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.224
No, no.
- Lady, lady, really.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.992
She's Christian.
She won't wear those.

31:05.263 --> 31:06.730
It is good for the soul.

31:06.732 --> 31:09.700
Oh, okay, um, I'm okay,
but thank you.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.768
I just wanted to look.

31:16.709 --> 31:19.109
- Uh-huh?
- I can read the hand.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.110
Oh.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.478
Tell her what she's won, lady.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.080
Okay.

31:25.650 --> 31:26.583
Oh...

31:27.285 --> 31:30.487
You had...
Abortion recently.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.922
Abortion?

31:31.924 --> 31:34.224
No... no.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.293
I-- what?!

31:36.295 --> 31:37.928
What?!

31:37.930 --> 31:39.796
- Leave!
- What?!

31:39.798 --> 31:41.965
- Leave!
- Okay, Jesus!

31:41.967 --> 31:45.035
You crazy bitch!

31:47.239 --> 31:48.906
Dani, wait up!

31:50.042 --> 31:50.974
Dani, are you okay?

31:50.976 --> 31:53.143
I am so freaked out right now.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.879
It's usually really fun here.
I'm sorry.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.281
Naw, it's fine.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.884
So, where to now?

32:00.886 --> 32:03.053
You pick.
Where you wanna go?

32:03.055 --> 32:05.055
I've never been here.
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

32:05.057 --> 32:07.424
Oh, okay.
So, in your whole life,

32:07.426 --> 32:10.227
you never said
"if I ever get to la,
I'm gonna try this out."

32:10.229 --> 32:11.395
Never happened?

32:11.397 --> 32:13.330
Um... oh!

32:13.332 --> 32:15.232
Let's be contestants
on the price is right!

32:15.234 --> 32:17.134
Oh, hell no.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.336
Okay, uh, wheel of fortune?!

32:19.338 --> 32:22.306
Strike two, kiddo. One more.

32:22.308 --> 32:25.809
Oh! I know! I know!
I know! I know!

32:25.811 --> 32:27.678
I'm like a stripper on a pole.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.813
Two words: Ron Jeremy.

32:29.815 --> 32:32.849
This is the greatest street
in the world!

32:32.851 --> 32:34.651
Now you're fuckin' skippin'.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.486
Yeah, yeah, blow a kiss
to the camera.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.055
There you go!

32:40.125 --> 32:43.193
I'm so glad those douchebags
peaced out.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.394
Not me!

32:44.396 --> 32:46.330
Oh, my god.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.799
And it will never be yours.

32:50.369 --> 32:54.204
Dude, you look just like it!
You're creepy.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.639
Those are awesome, man!
I want those...

32:55.641 --> 32:57.774
I would kill to see you
in that, actually!

33:00.945 --> 33:03.113
That's ugly.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.115
Ooh!
- Oh, my god, Stacy.

33:05.117 --> 33:05.115
- Now that's awesome!
- Dude!

33:05.117 --> 33:08.752
You would never be
caught dead in that.
Are you kidding me?

33:08.754 --> 33:10.554
Matching pants and purse.
That's hot.

33:10.556 --> 33:11.888
Right?

33:13.024 --> 33:14.257
Shimmering!

33:15.193 --> 33:17.394
This place looks nice.
You wanna stop here?

33:17.396 --> 33:19.029
No, Dani, can we go now?

33:19.031 --> 33:20.697
It's getting dark soon.
- Hold on. Hold on.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.001
Son of a bitch.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.435
Who is it?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.237
It's frank.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.872
Dani, don't answer it!

33:28.874 --> 33:30.340
Why are you callin' me?

33:30.342 --> 33:32.142
Dani, you're fucking stupid.
Get off the phone.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.378
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
I can't understand you.

33:35.713 --> 33:38.482
Okay, don't talk to me
about serafine.
You know better.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.384
Who's serafine?

33:40.386 --> 33:41.651
His wife.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.353
Really? Serafine?
Serafine's her name?

33:43.355 --> 33:45.555
No. I don't give a shit.
Call the police if you want.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.557
Why-why are you
telling me this?

33:50.161 --> 33:54.331
Look, I'm not even at home.
I'm not even in the state--

33:54.333 --> 33:56.233
how do you know
I'm in California?

33:56.235 --> 33:57.667
Dani, just hang up the phone!

33:57.669 --> 33:59.970
Just give me a second!

34:01.173 --> 34:03.040
Frank, I don't need
this fucking shit

34:03.042 --> 34:04.908
right now, okay?

34:06.244 --> 34:07.711
Please.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.913
Stop trying to scare me, okay?

34:09.915 --> 34:11.348
I don't believe in it.

34:11.350 --> 34:14.885
I don't believe in any of it,
so just fucking stop!

34:14.887 --> 34:16.386
No, I told you before!

34:16.388 --> 34:17.754
Listen to me!
Listen!

34:17.755 --> 34:19.022
I told you before,

34:19.024 --> 34:21.091
I don't want nothing to do
with you or your fucking wife,

34:21.092 --> 34:22.759
okay, so just leave me
the fuck alone!

34:22.761 --> 34:24.460
I swear to god.

34:25.596 --> 34:27.931
Whatever, dude.
I don't even fucking care.

34:27.933 --> 34:30.132
All right, I'm hanging up
right now, don't you ever...

34:30.135 --> 34:32.202
...fucking call me again!

34:33.737 --> 34:35.405
Are you okay?

34:35.407 --> 34:36.606
I'm fine!

34:36.608 --> 34:38.809
No, you're not.
What did he say?

34:38.811 --> 34:40.911
- She's here.
- What do you mean?

34:40.913 --> 34:43.580
Apparently she's
in Los Angeles.

34:43.581 --> 34:47.250
And I'll strangle that bitch
if she goes anywhere near you.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.918
I mean he's just trying
to scare me, right?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.821
I mean, there's no way
she could possibly...

34:50.822 --> 34:52.656
...know where I am, right?

34:52.658 --> 34:54.123
Dani, yeah,
she has voodoo powers.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.659
Woohoo.

34:58.529 --> 35:02.432
Why, why can't I just be
in a normal relationship?

35:02.434 --> 35:04.434
Why do I have to get involved

35:04.436 --> 35:06.503
with these fucking douchebags

35:06.505 --> 35:08.672
who either are married
or have girlfriends--

35:08.674 --> 35:10.474
You didn't know
he was married, Dani.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.542
That doesn't count.
- It doesn't matter!

35:12.544 --> 35:15.112
- He's the asshole. Not you.
- It fucking happened, okay?

35:15.114 --> 35:18.482
I mean fuck,
maybe your dad was right.
- Don't you dare go there.

35:18.484 --> 35:21.051
Maybe-maybe I just don't
deserve to be with anyone,

35:21.053 --> 35:23.120
and everyone
is too good for me and...
- Dani, stop it!

35:23.122 --> 35:25.188
- I'll be alone the fucking
rest of my life.
- Just stop it!

35:25.190 --> 35:27.691
- What?! Why can't we
talk about it?!
- You know why, Dani!

35:27.693 --> 35:30.560
- Why can't we talk about it?
- Dani, shut up!

35:33.264 --> 35:34.931
Oh, Jesus.

35:38.336 --> 35:39.903
Dani, look.

35:41.072 --> 35:43.440
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.841
- I'm sorry.
- No.

35:44.843 --> 35:47.611
Oh, babe, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

35:51.616 --> 35:52.849
Babe, I'm sorry.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.551
No, I'm sorry.

35:58.222 --> 36:00.490
I shouldn't have said all that.
I shouldn't have brought it up.

36:00.492 --> 36:04.294
You have every right
to be angry right now.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.762
I get it, okay?

36:07.765 --> 36:12.202
Look, you came here to
get away from everything, right?

36:13.671 --> 36:14.604
Right?

36:15.406 --> 36:17.541
Okay, then get away
from everything.

36:19.143 --> 36:21.645
It just seems like
no matter what I do,

36:21.647 --> 36:24.314
my past just follows me
wherever I go.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.650
Only if you let it follow you.

36:28.085 --> 36:29.352
What do you have
to worry about?

36:29.354 --> 36:33.757
You really think that crazy,
psycho lady is out here in la?

36:33.759 --> 36:36.092
Ok. You know better.

36:36.094 --> 36:38.762
Since have you ever started
believing in that shit?

36:41.365 --> 36:44.701
I just-i just want to have
a normal life.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.836
A normal relationship.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.672
Have you met our family?

36:50.908 --> 36:54.377
It'll be fine. It's just...

36:54.379 --> 36:55.645
I don't know.

36:59.183 --> 37:01.051
We could go kill her.

37:01.053 --> 37:02.352
- We could.
- We could.

37:02.354 --> 37:03.753
- We should.
- We should.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.622
Be fun.
Am I seeing a smile?

37:06.791 --> 37:09.025
No? Not yet?
Not quite?

37:12.296 --> 37:15.398
Can we get out of this
fucking parking garage, please?

37:15.400 --> 37:19.102
No. I'll make you stay here.
You walked down here.

37:19.104 --> 37:21.438
I could show you
a really cool place, though.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.973
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.908
I like cool places.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.309
Do you?
This one's pretty cool.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.611
Lots of lights.

37:27.613 --> 37:28.845
Fun times.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.014
But you have to smile.

37:31.782 --> 37:35.852
Yay. All right,
get your ass up.

37:36.887 --> 37:38.221
Don't peek! Don't peek!
Don't peek!

37:38.223 --> 37:40.557
- I'm not peeking!
- All right. Come on.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.225
Just a little further.
- What is it?!

37:42.227 --> 37:43.326
You'll see.

37:44.161 --> 37:45.462
Come on, slow poke.
Come on, come on!

37:45.464 --> 37:47.797
All right! Stand there.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.734
Wait for it.
All right, open your eyes!

37:52.803 --> 37:55.005
Oh!

37:57.208 --> 37:58.942
Oh, stace!

37:59.377 --> 38:01.111
It's beautiful!

38:01.113 --> 38:02.579
Right?

38:05.516 --> 38:07.917
Stace, can you bring me
my jacket while you're there?

38:07.919 --> 38:09.719
Yeah, yeah, fine!

38:12.857 --> 38:14.257
- Ouf!
- Wimp.

38:14.259 --> 38:16.760
Is it always this cold
at night?

38:16.762 --> 38:19.529
You're not
in New Orleans anymore, Dorothy.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.031
You don't want one?

38:21.033 --> 38:22.299
No, I'm not cold.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.433
Girl, you're crazy.

38:25.836 --> 38:29.706
Oh, man, look at these lights.
It's so beautiful.

38:29.708 --> 38:33.476
I love coming up here.
Chill out.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.445
Get out of the world,
kinda thing.

38:37.214 --> 38:38.848
I wanna live here.

38:39.517 --> 38:40.850
Do it.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.152
It's easy.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.854
Yeah, right.
My dad would kill me.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.290
I'll protect you.

38:50.394 --> 38:52.395
Remember back...

38:52.397 --> 38:55.065
...when I beat the hell out of
that chick Lindsey woodfield,

38:55.067 --> 38:56.533
back in the fourth grade,

38:56.535 --> 38:59.235
when she pulled your hair
in pe?

38:59.237 --> 39:02.205
Yeah, you beat the shit
out of her.

39:02.207 --> 39:03.873
Mt protector.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.375
Always.

39:05.377 --> 39:06.976
You're like my little sis.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.411
Gotta protect you.

39:14.318 --> 39:16.753
And now I'm all alone
'cause you wanted to go

39:16.755 --> 39:20.490
and be some rock star.
You know, I blame mtv.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.925
Fuck mtv!

39:25.996 --> 39:27.330
I miss you.

39:28.332 --> 39:29.933
I'm scared, stace.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.577
Oh, man. I'm exhausted.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.912
Really? I feel fine.

39:44.181 --> 39:45.915
I smell fire.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.784
Yo, yo, yo!
What's goin' on?

39:47.786 --> 39:49.419
Hi, guys.

39:49.421 --> 39:50.687
Hi.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.689
Gonna jam a bit.
You wanna hang?

39:52.691 --> 39:54.190
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

39:55.159 --> 39:56.459
You wanna hang?

39:56.461 --> 39:58.461
Naw, I'm good.
You go ahead.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.096
I'm beat.
- You sure?

40:00.098 --> 40:01.731
Yeah. Just tired.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.566
Just one drink.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.602
We can play for you.
You can be our audience.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.303
You can tell us
how awesome we are.

40:07.305 --> 40:08.605
How awesome I am.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.373
All right.
How awesome he is.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.777
Oh, check this out.
I just wrote this.

40:18.182 --> 40:19.249
Great.

40:20.317 --> 40:22.318
Sorry guys, we just had
a really long day.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.953
Another time for sure, though.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.755
I'm gonna hold you up to that.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.323
I'll see you soon.

40:27.325 --> 40:28.958
All right. Bye, guys.

40:28.960 --> 40:29.893
Good night.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.662
Your cousin's
fucking hot, dude.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.264
She can hear you, retard.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.865
Shut the fuck up.

40:57.087 --> 40:58.121
Night, daddy.

41:04.829 --> 41:06.496
So,

41:06.498 --> 41:08.465
I woke up
to some kind of drums

41:08.467 --> 41:10.700
or something from downstairs.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.203
It finally stopped.

41:13.938 --> 41:16.072
So I'm having a smoke for now.

41:19.043 --> 41:22.679
They must've moved the party
into the studio,

41:22.681 --> 41:25.281
which is directly
below my bedroom.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.217
Thank you, Stacy.

41:28.519 --> 41:30.620
I hate it when I can't sleep.

41:32.424 --> 41:34.123
There it is again.

41:37.795 --> 41:40.029
Come on, stace.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.098
I can't sleep.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.344
Stacy!

41:54.346 --> 41:57.046
Can you please keep it down?
I can't sleep!

41:59.116 --> 42:00.450
Stace!

42:13.998 --> 42:16.566
I don't know what the fuck
she's doing down there.

42:24.275 --> 42:25.675
Stace!

42:32.784 --> 42:35.184
Like this house
wasn't scary enough.

42:35.186 --> 42:36.419
Stacy.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.788
Quit beating the drum
at three am, crazy!

42:38.790 --> 42:40.356
I'm trying to sleep!

42:40.358 --> 42:42.091
Jesus!

42:42.593 --> 42:44.460
All right. Whatever!

42:46.463 --> 42:49.032
Sorry to interrupt
your bang session!

43:08.752 --> 43:10.553
All right.

43:10.555 --> 43:11.754
Take two.

43:13.625 --> 43:15.224
Motherfucker!

43:19.297 --> 43:21.097
What the fuck?

43:21.099 --> 43:23.199
Stacy, you fucking bitch.

43:23.201 --> 43:26.169
Stacy! Stacy!

43:28.239 --> 43:30.406
Stacy, where are you?!

43:32.409 --> 43:33.710
What the fuck?

43:34.778 --> 43:36.479
Dani.

43:41.353 --> 43:44.020
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

43:45.056 --> 43:46.789
What the fuck was that?

43:46.791 --> 43:47.957
Fuck!

43:49.694 --> 43:51.628
Fuck. Please. Okay.

43:51.630 --> 43:53.930
Okay. Okay.

43:53.932 --> 43:56.599
Please answer. Fuck.

43:56.601 --> 43:59.369
Stacy... come on! Fuck!

44:04.808 --> 44:06.275
Stace, it's me.

44:06.277 --> 44:08.911
I was just downstairs
and I don't know what the fuck
is going on!

44:08.913 --> 44:10.113
But, there's something
down there

44:10.115 --> 44:12.448
and if this is a joke
it's not funny!

44:12.450 --> 44:16.452
Please come get me!
I'm at the top of the stairs
and I'm really fucking scared.

44:16.454 --> 44:19.355
Okay, I'm up in my room.
Please come get me.

44:19.357 --> 44:20.623
Oh fuck.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.267
I don't think that's her.

44:40.177 --> 44:41.477
Oh, fuck.

44:44.882 --> 44:46.249
No!

45:10.742 --> 45:12.208
Oh, god.

45:14.112 --> 45:16.813
Why is this happening?

45:19.951 --> 45:23.953
Stacy? Stacy?

45:26.023 --> 45:27.557
Stacy, is that you?

45:33.697 --> 45:36.165
Leave me alone!

45:48.178 --> 45:49.445
Stacy?

45:49.947 --> 45:51.080
Stacy?

45:54.085 --> 45:56.018
Stacy. Stacy, is that you?

45:58.856 --> 46:00.723
Stacy...

46:10.434 --> 46:11.968
Come.

46:21.980 --> 46:23.446
Come!

46:39.430 --> 46:41.964
Oh, Jesus Christ!

46:54.612 --> 46:58.114
No! No, no, no, no!

47:05.390 --> 47:09.058
Stacy! Stacy! Stacy!

48:02.479 --> 48:06.148
Finally.

48:06.150 --> 48:12.255
You thought you could get
away with what you've done.

48:13.190 --> 48:17.793
There's nowhere to hide now.

48:18.629 --> 48:21.364
Frank's suffering

48:21.366 --> 48:27.837
is nothing compared to what
you will now experience.

48:27.839 --> 48:31.741
Your cousin already rots

48:31.743 --> 48:36.312
for what you've done
to my home.

48:36.314 --> 48:39.315
The master will show you

48:39.317 --> 48:45.421
the true meaning
of pain eternal.

48:45.423 --> 48:48.925
Leave this world forsaken.

48:50.595 --> 48:54.931
I curse you to hell!

49:01.272 --> 49:05.308
Help me! Help me!

49:05.310 --> 49:07.476
Whoa! Whoa!

49:19.357 --> 49:20.957
Let me out!

49:41.646 --> 49:42.945
Oh, my god!

49:42.947 --> 49:45.281
Let me go!

49:47.151 --> 49:49.552
Help me!

49:50.287 --> 49:52.355
Let me go!

49:55.660 --> 49:57.126
Welcome.

50:33.196 --> 50:35.564
Oh, god!

50:42.172 --> 50:45.408
Please! Somebody help me!

50:45.410 --> 50:47.109
Oh, my god.

51:02.026 --> 51:03.859
Oh, my god.

51:03.861 --> 51:05.227
Oh, my god.

51:11.301 --> 51:13.002
Oh, my god.

51:19.176 --> 51:21.143
Where am I?

51:23.346 --> 51:26.015
Why? Why?

51:36.760 --> 51:39.195
Who would do this?

52:46.196 --> 52:49.365
Innocence...

52:49.367 --> 52:51.500
God, help me!

52:51.502 --> 52:54.036
He's not here.

53:11.088 --> 53:13.756
Help me! Help me!

53:30.740 --> 53:32.274
No! Please!

53:32.276 --> 53:34.176
Please, stop it!

53:34.178 --> 53:37.379
Stop it! Stop it!

53:41.018 --> 53:42.585
Leave me alone!

53:42.587 --> 53:45.521
Leave me alone. Please.

53:45.523 --> 53:49.525
Please. Please.

53:51.094 --> 53:53.062
Please.

53:53.064 --> 53:54.797
Why?!

53:55.800 --> 53:58.601
She's so thin.

54:02.440 --> 54:05.307
Greetings, Dani.

54:20.825 --> 54:22.958
Please help me. Please.

54:22.960 --> 54:27.930
False hopes have no place here.

54:42.746 --> 54:45.547
Get back!

55:01.364 --> 55:05.134
You smell delicious.

55:07.338 --> 55:08.337
No!

55:13.711 --> 55:16.512
Satan! Satan!

55:52.515 --> 55:57.619
He cannot help you here.

55:58.855 --> 56:04.093
There is no return.

56:05.195 --> 56:08.897
You have only just begun.

56:10.567 --> 56:14.303
Circles do not connect here.

56:20.243 --> 56:24.046
There is only forward.

56:24.048 --> 56:28.150
Now go.

56:29.552 --> 56:32.621
Now!

57:51.301 --> 57:54.536
Feast on her false hope.

58:02.278 --> 58:04.780
No! No!

58:35.845 --> 58:37.379
Out!

58:38.481 --> 58:39.348
Now!

58:39.350 --> 58:40.883
Okay!

58:45.255 --> 58:49.324
You don't want to miss this.

58:56.566 --> 58:58.600
Witness.

59:02.006 --> 59:04.239
Fucking bitch!

59:05.942 --> 59:08.777
We own your soul!

59:12.616 --> 59:14.016
Eat!

59:18.689 --> 59:20.022
Eat it!

59:26.195 --> 59:28.363
Eat it 'til you choke!

59:32.602 --> 59:34.703
Forward!

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.078
Feed us!

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:19.414
Feed us!

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:23.452
It's dead!

01:00:23.454 --> 01:00:25.387
My baby!

01:00:25.389 --> 01:00:27.222
Dead.

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.826
Give me my baby!

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:34.529
No! No!

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.842
Remember when
you killed your baby, Dani?

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:49.745
We do! We do!

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:54.950
We do! We do! We do!

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:58.053
We do! We do!

01:00:58.055 --> 01:01:00.656
There's more!

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:08.130
See his servants now.

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:15.037
Mine!

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:17.406
I want to play.

01:01:17.408 --> 01:01:19.207
Suck your cock, priest.

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:21.643
Suck your cock!

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:28.116
- Say it. Say it.
- Jesus is dead.

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:29.317
Take it, nun.

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:36.892
It belongs to the one.

01:01:36.894 --> 01:01:38.994
Our father, who art in heaven,

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:41.396
hallowed be thy name!
Thy king--

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.241
There!

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:11.693
Pray to your god in here.

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:19.134
It's just us.

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:27.275
You will silence
your prayers here.

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:32.748
All imagined
will bleed throughout.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:37.919
Empty your fears
and become one.

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:42.858
Oh, god,
why won't you help me?!

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:53.702
Abandon all hope.

01:02:53.704 --> 01:02:58.907
This is eternal.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.944
He deserted you.

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:09.151
He deserted you!

01:03:17.628 --> 01:03:22.330
Your journey,
'tis not complete.

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:28.103
We have much more to show you,
Danielle lamb.

01:03:28.105 --> 01:03:30.639
Enter your fate.

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:32.267
Your hair is so pretty.

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:35.170
Just like you.

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:37.806
Oh, god, why?

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.642
Hello, Danielle.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:43.078
I've been waiting for you.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.947
Remember your uncle jakey?

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:49.684
Please, please.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.258
Remember how we
used to play together?

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:59.928
Me, you, and Stacy.

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:02.597
It's impossible. You're dead!

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:04.633
Stop it!

01:05:04.635 --> 01:05:06.268
That's what you used to say.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:08.470
I used to love it
when you would tell me to stop.

01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:12.540
Keep saying it, baby.
Keep telling me to stop.

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.545
Please?

01:05:18.147 --> 01:05:20.515
Ah, okay.

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:22.317
I understand.

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:24.819
Come here, sweetheart.

01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:26.254
It's okay.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.556
She's mine now.

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:30.125
She wants to be with me.

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:33.094
Just like you did
when you were small.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.462
Fuck you!

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:37.232
Not yet, baby.

01:05:37.234 --> 01:05:40.135
I have to wait
just a little bit longer.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.841
Oh yes. I almost forgot.

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:48.643
There's a surprise for you.

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:53.014
We can have play time
after your surprise, Danielle.

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:55.917
Go ahead, get your surprise.

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:02.257
Hurry back.

01:06:02.259 --> 01:06:05.226
You know how your uncle jakey
doesn't like to wait.

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.339
Mama?

01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:20.175
Oh! Oh, my god!

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:24.379
How are you here?!

01:06:24.381 --> 01:06:27.115
I'm here, baby.
It's me.

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:29.784
Mama, where are we?
Please.

01:06:29.786 --> 01:06:32.654
I just wanna go home.
Can't you take me home, please?

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.556
Oh, dear.
You are home.

01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:36.124
I'm here now,

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:38.293
and I won't let them
hurt you anymore.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:40.128
Please, let's just
go home, okay?

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.664
I don't know why
this is happening to me.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.567
There, there, there.

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:46.668
Oh.

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:52.040
You just don't realize
how important you are.

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:54.542
He's been asking about you.

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:58.813
And everyone's been so anxious
to finally meet you.

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:03.618
It isn't every day
he personally requests
somebody to join us.

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:06.921
Who?

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.424
Oh, Dani.

01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:11.593
Don't you understand?
- No.

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:13.361
The one.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.530
There is only one.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:18.266
And you'll be with him soon,
baby.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:21.469
And then everything
will be all better.

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:28.910
Oh, dear.

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:31.646
I shouldn't have said that.

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:35.083
No, no, no, no!
Please don't hurt her!

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:36.518
Please, just leave her alone!

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:40.722
No!

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:46.594
Oh, baby, please don't fight!

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:54.736
Mama! Mama!

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:07.549
Choke on your mother's bowels,
you fucking cunt!

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.861
Oh, mama.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.930
Mama.

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:58.600
Mama.

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:07.876
I'm sorry.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:10.044
I'm sorry.

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:39.506
Please... please let me die.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:41.576
Please.

01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:45.412
Then it is time.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:25.186
We invoke thee.

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:44.105
Dani!

01:10:44.107 --> 01:10:45.873
- Stacy!
- Dani!

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.976
It's okay.
I'm right here.

01:10:47.978 --> 01:10:50.878
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.548
Don't be afraid.

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:57.218
Stacy! Stacy!

01:10:59.389 --> 01:11:03.157
No!

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:57.732
Aeternum meus.

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:58.893
Your soul endures.

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:18.673
It is complete.

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.326
What?

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:15.129
What?

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:57.131
It's over... it's over.

01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:00.301
It's over.

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.287
Hello?

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.540
Hello?

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:11.272
You're dead!

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:14.842
You're dead.

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:37.498
You're dead!

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:41.302
You're dead! You're dead!
