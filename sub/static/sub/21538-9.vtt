- PREVIOUSLY, ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:04.471 --> 00:05.772
- YOU GOT GOOD NEWS FOR ME?

00:05.805 --> 00:07.674
- IF YOU THINK FULL ASK
IS GOOD NEWS,

00:07.707 --> 00:09.876
THEN, YEAH,
I GOT GOOD NEWS, BABY.

00:09.909 --> 00:11.978
AND THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.315
- [gasps]
WOW, THIS IS AMAZING!

00:15.348 --> 00:16.916
NEW YORK!
- [laughs]

00:16.950 --> 00:18.284
- THAT'S OUR BEST.

00:18.318 --> 00:21.855
- 14.5 MILLION.
WE HAVE A DEAL.

00:21.888 --> 00:24.257
- GUESS WHAT.
I'M IN PUERTO RICO!

00:24.290 --> 00:25.892
I HAVE CLIENTS FROM NEW YORK
THAT WANT TO BUY

00:25.925 --> 00:28.328
A VACATION HOME RIGHT HERE,
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN MY FAMILY,

00:28.361 --> 00:29.963
SO IT'S JUST ALL A BONUS.

00:29.996 --> 00:32.499
PUERTO RICO!

00:32.532 --> 00:35.502
[upbeat music]

00:35.535 --> 00:36.670
* *

00:36.703 --> 00:40.874
- MY MOTTO IS "EXPANSION ALWAYS,
IN ALL WAYS."

00:40.907 --> 00:43.376
- NEW YORK CITY IS
THE MOST EXCITING CITY

00:43.410 --> 00:45.111
FOR REAL ESTATE,
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.681
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.250
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:50.283 --> 00:51.384
WAH!

00:51.418 --> 00:52.886
- I WILL BREAK YOUR TEETH.
- REACH HIGH.

00:52.919 --> 00:54.154
- CAN YOU TAKE
THIS GUY OUT OF HERE?

00:54.187 --> 00:55.155
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING

00:55.188 --> 00:56.423
TO HELP ME.
- WHAT?

00:56.456 --> 00:57.757
- YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.

00:57.791 --> 01:01.795
* *

01:07.634 --> 01:09.703
- I AM IN PUERTO RICO
WITH DR. AND MRS. JONES,

01:09.736 --> 01:12.238
AND I AM VERY DETERMINED
TO HELPING THEM FIND

01:12.272 --> 01:13.840
THEIR PERFECT VACATION.

01:13.873 --> 01:15.809
EVEN THOUGH THEIR BUDGET
WAS UP TO $1 MILLION,

01:15.842 --> 01:17.410
THEY WANTED TO SEE
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING

01:17.444 --> 01:18.578
THAT THERE WAS TO SEE,

01:18.611 --> 01:21.214
SO I SHOWED THEM
THREE SPECTACULAR PROPERTIES,

01:21.247 --> 01:23.216
AND BEFORE THEY MAKE
THEIR DECISION TOMORROW,

01:23.249 --> 01:24.951
I WANT TO SHOW THEM
WHAT PUERTO RICO

01:24.984 --> 01:25.985
REALLY IS ALL ABOUT.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.988
[salsa music]

01:29.089 --> 01:32.459
* *

01:43.169 --> 01:44.938
- THE NIGHT IS GOOD.
EVERYBODY'S DANCING,

01:44.971 --> 01:47.574
AND I LOOK AROUND, AND IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY'RE FIGHTING.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.880
- SINCE I'VE KNOWN THE JONES,
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM

01:53.913 --> 01:54.914
HAVING AN ARGUMENT EVEN.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.722
- WHAT THE [bleep]
JUST HAPPENED?

02:08.161 --> 02:11.064
GUYS, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:11.064 --> 02:12.465
- WELL, THE PROBLEM
IS THAT WE'RE JUST--

02:12.499 --> 02:13.667
WE'RE SO FAR APART
RIGHT NOW.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.468
- I JUST--I DON'T--
I MEAN, TO ME,

02:15.502 --> 02:17.570
THE ONE THAT MAKES
THE MOST SENSE BUSINESS-WISE,

02:17.604 --> 02:20.073
YES, IT'S $4 MILLION,
BUT IT'S BIG,

02:20.073 --> 02:22.409
AND IT'S RIGHT
ON THE GOLF COURSE.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.310
- REMEMBER, WE CAME HERE
WITH A $1 MILLION BUDGET,

02:24.344 --> 02:25.311
RIGHT?
- YES.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.613
- A $1 MILLION BUDGET.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.748
I'M UP TO $4 MILLION.
WE JUST DON'T NEED THAT.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.083
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE
CAME HERE FOR, BABE.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.919
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
LET'S START OVER.

02:32.952 --> 02:34.721
I THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE
SOMETHING VERY, VERY SPECIAL.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.823
- I JUST THINK, AT THIS POINT,
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST HOLD OFF

02:36.856 --> 02:39.693
AND DO NOTHING, BECAUSE CLEARLY,
WE'RE NOT REALLY

02:39.726 --> 02:40.860
ON THE SAME PAGE,
AND MAYBE WE JUST NEED TO--

02:40.894 --> 02:43.096
- OKAY, LET ME TRY--
THIS IS VERY NEW TO ME.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.764
I THOUGHT WE WERE, LIKE,
HAVING A GOOD TIME. I JUST--

02:44.798 --> 02:46.466
- WE'RE ONLY GONNA BE HERE
FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.568
EVERY--YOU KNOW--
- YES.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.203
- BUT I DON'T THINK SO.
2.5.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.472
I THINK THAT'S
MORE THAN REASONABLE.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.274
- I KNOW I'M NOT
MAKING MONEY ON THIS DEAL,

02:54.307 --> 02:57.010
BUT IF I KEEP THEM HAPPY,

02:57.110 --> 02:59.279
I KNOW I WILL MAKE MONEY
WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.515
I SEE, I UNDERSTAND NOW.
OKAY, LISTEN.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.317
I REMEMBER THE DAY THAT
WE WERE LOOKING AT THE TOWN--

03:04.351 --> 03:06.252
AT THE VILLA,
AND THE BEACH,

03:06.286 --> 03:08.455
AND YOU WERE THE HAPPIEST WOMAN
IN THE WORLD. YOU WERE.

03:08.488 --> 03:09.856
- I LIKE THE--DON'T GET ME--
- YOU REMEMBER?

03:09.889 --> 03:11.057
I KNOW, IT WAS PROBABLY--
- WAIT A MINUTE.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.559
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I LIKE THE WATER.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.761
I DON'T WANT--AND I'M NOT
TRYING TO GET US TO SPEND

03:14.794 --> 03:16.596
MORE THAN WE CAME HERE FOR.
- I UNDERSTAND.

03:16.629 --> 03:17.931
- I'M JUST SAYING THAT WE SEE...
- YOU SEE THE VALUE.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.567
- AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST
IN SOMETHING

03:20.600 --> 03:22.802
THAT COULD BE BIGGER,
AND THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.071
- YOU'RE REAL ESTATE ORIENTED,
AND YOU SEE A TROPHY PROPERTY,

03:25.105 --> 03:27.507
AND--BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S A STEP AT A TIME.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.809
WHY DON'T WE DO THIS?
WHY DON'T WE CONSIDER

03:29.843 --> 03:32.545
THE $2.5 MILLION VILLA THAT YOU
WERE BOTH CLEARLY HAPPY WITH?

03:32.579 --> 03:35.582
- CLEARLY HAPPY WITH.
- OKAY? LET'S GO.

03:38.184 --> 03:40.120
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

03:40.153 --> 03:43.123
- I MEAN, I'LL CONCEDE,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ON THE WATER,

03:43.156 --> 03:44.324
AND I KNOW THAT ULTIMATELY, I
THINK WE SHOULD BE ON THE WATER.

03:44.357 --> 03:45.325
- BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S
WHAT I NEED.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.526
I NEED THAT WATER.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.595
- LISTEN, REGARDLESS
OF WHAT WE CHOOSE,

03:48.628 --> 03:51.131
WE'RE NOT GONNA LOSE,
SO LET'S JUST GO

03:51.164 --> 03:53.600
WITH SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE BOTH
COMFORTABLE WITH.

03:53.633 --> 03:54.868
- SOUNDS GOOD.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.469
- YES!

03:56.503 --> 03:59.139
NOW, CAN WE DRINK? CAN WE DANCE?
CAN WE HAVE A GOOD TIME?

03:59.172 --> 04:00.640
CAN WE GET DRUNK? CAN WE PARTY?
- YES, PLEASE.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.275
- CAN WE LIVE THIS LIFE!
- [laughs]

04:02.308 --> 04:03.910
- YES.
- YES, LET'S LIVE IT.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.748
- OH, JENNIFER LOPEZ,
I CALLED HER LAST WEEK,

04:08.782 --> 04:09.816
BUT SHE DIDN'T
PICK UP MY PHONE.

04:09.849 --> 04:12.419
[laughter]

04:17.090 --> 04:21.194
- FERNANDO, I HAVE TO BE
IN BROOKLYN IN ABOUT 25 MINUTES.

04:21.227 --> 04:22.395
CAN YOU MAKE IT
TO PARK SLOPE?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.664
TO ME, LUXURY HAS NO BORDERS.

04:24.698 --> 04:28.068
YES, I SELL THE MAJORITY
OF WHAT I DO IN MANHATTAN,

04:28.101 --> 04:30.670
BUT BROOKLYN THESE DAYS,
IT'S EXPENSIVE.

04:32.138 --> 04:35.275
YOU CAN SAY THAT PARK SLOPE
IS LIKE THE UPPER WEST SIDE

04:35.308 --> 04:38.311
OF BROOKLYN--
BEAUTIFUL TREE-LINED STREETS,

04:38.345 --> 04:40.213
BIG, BEAUTIFUL TOWNHOMES,

04:40.246 --> 04:43.983
AND IT'S RIGHT ON A PARK,
VERY FAMILY DRIVEN.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.587
HERE IT IS.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.092
[knocking at the door]
HI. HI, JEANNE?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.194
- HELLO, YES, HI.
- I'M FREDRIK.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.796
JEANNE IS AN INVESTOR
WHO DOES TOWNHOUSE RESTORATION

04:56.830 --> 04:58.164
AND BIGGER BUILDINGS.

04:58.198 --> 05:01.468
THIS HOME IS JUST ONE UNIT,
BUT SHE CALLED ME

05:01.501 --> 05:03.203
BECAUSE OF MY NEW DEVELOPMENT
EXPERIENCE.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.038
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:05.071 --> 05:07.741
- AND NICE TO MEET
THIS BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.479
WOW, I LOVE IT.
SHOW ME AROUND.

05:12.512 --> 05:13.646
- I WOULD LOVE TO.

05:17.450 --> 05:18.885
- SO THIS IS ORIGINAL?

05:18.918 --> 05:19.886
- THAT IS ORIGINAL TILE,

05:19.919 --> 05:21.421
YES, IT IS.
- OR--OH, MY GOD.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.360
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL WORK
OF RESTORATION,

05:27.394 --> 05:29.062
MOLDINGS, FIREPLACES, FLOORS.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.497
WOW!
- EVERYTHING HERE IS ORIGINAL.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.565
- I MEAN, THEY DON'T BUILD
HOUSES LIKE THIS ANYMORE.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.566
- NO, THEY DON'T.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.901
- AND THEN, WHERE NEEDED,

05:34.934 --> 05:38.071
THERE'S ALSO
A MODERN TWIST TO IT.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.807
I LOVE THIS, OLD, NEW.
- NEW, YES.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.075
- YES.
- BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT

05:42.075 --> 05:43.410
AN OLD BATHROOM.
- NO, YOU DON'T.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.945
- HOW MANY BEDROOMS IN TOTAL?
- SIX.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.848
- SIX, SO IT'S REALLY
A PERFECT FAMILY HOUSE.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.183
- PERFECT.

05:50.216 --> 05:53.853
- SO IT'S PERSONAL,
AND I CAN TELL THAT YOU LOVE IT.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.689
- YES, WE INVEST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

05:55.722 --> 05:59.359
WE'RE DEVELOPERS, AND SO
THERE ARE OTHER PROPERTIES.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.594
- HOW MANY? HOW MANY?

06:01.628 --> 06:05.165
- A FEW.
- WHOA, THIS IS REALLY EXCITING.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.134
WELL, PRICE.
- RIGHT.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.803
- IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,

06:09.836 --> 06:13.173
TOWNHOUSES GO
UP TO $1,000 A FOOT,

06:13.206 --> 06:17.043
BUT THIS HOUSE, I'M THINKING
AS HIGH AS $1,200 A FOOT.

06:17.043 --> 06:21.114
I THINK SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN 4.1 AND 4.3,

06:21.147 --> 06:23.049
WHICH IS A RECORD, RECORD
EVER FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.051
- RIGHT, IT'S A DECENT PRICE,
BUT I'M LOOKING

06:25.051 --> 06:28.054
FOR MORE THAN THAT.
- DECENT? RECORD IS DECENT?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.489
- THIS IS A ONE OF A KIND
HOUSE.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.458
- I CAN SEE QUALITY
WHEN I SEE IT.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.159
I MEAN, YOU MUST HAVE PUT

06:33.193 --> 06:35.128
WELL OVER $1 MILLION
IN RENOVATIONS HERE.

06:35.161 --> 06:37.530
- WE PAID A LITTLE
OVER 2 MILLION FOR IT.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.099
WE PUT
OVER A MILLION INTO IT.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.267
UM--
- SO WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?

06:41.301 --> 06:43.570
- MORE LIKE 4.5.

06:43.603 --> 06:47.140
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NOT 4.5,
THAT'S WAY TOO HIGH.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.809
4.3, I WON'T GO
HIGHER THAN THAT.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.278
- WELL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO
HIGHER THAN THAT.

06:52.312 --> 06:55.615
- NO HOUSES IN PARK SLOPE
SELLS OVER 4 MILLION.

06:55.648 --> 06:58.118
IF I KNOW IT'S GOING TO TRADE
RIGHT THERE,

06:58.151 --> 06:59.419
I LIKE TO PRICE EXACT.

06:59.452 --> 07:02.589
- I SEE YOUR POINT,
BUT PEOPLE LIKE TO COME IN,

07:02.622 --> 07:06.059
AND THEY DO LIKE TO HAVE A
LITTLE BIT OF BARGAINING POWER.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.195
HOW ABOUT 4.450?

07:09.229 --> 07:11.097
- WELL, JUST REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.700
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME
BUILT-IN DISCOUNT IN THAT,

07:13.733 --> 07:15.802
AND I STILL WANT YOU
TO BE ECSTATIC

07:15.835 --> 07:19.706
WHEN IT TRADES
A LITTLE LOWER THAN THAT.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.374
- I WILL BE.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.776
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

07:22.809 --> 07:27.247
- I LOVE SETTING A RECORD
IN AN ENTIRELY NEW NEIGHBORHOOD,

07:27.280 --> 07:30.617
BUT EVEN MORE SO, IS TO GET IN
WITH A NEW DEVELOPER

07:30.650 --> 07:32.519
WHO HAS MORE STUFF COMING
IN THE PIPELINE.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.387
BYE,
BEAUTIFUL GARFIELD HOUSE.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.900
- HEY, RYAN.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.169
- DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE MEETINGS
LIKE THIS IN THE RAIN?

07:49.202 --> 07:51.171
- JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU,
YOU KNOW,

07:51.204 --> 07:53.873
OF THE BUILDING THAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO SELL FOR US.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.075
- RIGHT.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.509
MY SKY GARAGE PENTHOUSE
LISTING

07:56.543 --> 08:00.180
IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
LISTINGS I'VE EVER HAD.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.416
IT'S A $23 MILLION PENTHOUSE

08:03.450 --> 08:05.618
WITH A PRIVATE CAR ELEVATOR...

08:05.652 --> 08:07.020
WOW.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.455
AND A SKYVAULT.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.024
- YOU WALK ONTO A BEAUTIFUL
GLASS RUNWAY,

08:11.024 --> 08:12.892
AND YOU LOOK DOWN
THROUGH THAT GLASS.

08:12.926 --> 08:13.927
THIS IS THE VAULT.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.628
- BUT WHILE SHOWING
THE APARTMENT

08:15.662 --> 08:18.598
WHILE IT WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION,
PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T GET IT.

08:18.631 --> 08:20.467
THE STAIRS ARE HERE.
- SO WHERE DO YOU ENTER

08:20.500 --> 08:22.402
THE STAIRS?
- RIGHT HERE.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.170
- I DON'T QUITE GET THIS.
- YOU DON'T GET IT?

08:24.204 --> 08:27.107
SO I'M WAITING FOR THINGS
TO BE COMPLETELY DONE

08:27.140 --> 08:28.742
BEFORE I BRING PEOPLE THROUGH,

08:28.775 --> 08:31.878
AND START MY BIG
MICHAEL BAY-STYLE COMMERCIAL.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.313
- SO HOW ARE THINGS GOING?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.648
- THE VIDEO'S GONNA HAPPEN
AS SOON AS THE WORK IS DONE.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.083
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
WAITING ON.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.152
I NEED PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.054
- YOU KNOW THERE IS STILL
WORK TO DO, BUT I FINALLY

08:41.054 --> 08:43.923
PUT IN THE MECHANICALS
FOR THE SKYVAULT.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.192
- AWESOME. THE GLASS IS IN.
- GLASS IS THERE.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.262
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO FILM YOUR COMMERCIAL

08:49.295 --> 08:51.865
THIS WEEKEND.

08:51.898 --> 08:55.068
- THIS WEEKEND?
ARE YOU K--ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

08:55.068 --> 08:57.070
- MR. RUE AND I BOTH
WANT TO SEE IT SOLD,

08:57.103 --> 09:00.573
SO PLEASE GET TO WORK.

09:00.607 --> 09:04.477
- UH...OKAY.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.812
THE COMMERCIAL I WANT TO DO
ISN'T JUST

09:05.845 --> 09:07.614
A REGULAR LISTING VIDEO.

09:07.647 --> 09:10.684
THIS IS SOMETHING I'M SPENDING,
YOU KNOW, $25,000 ON,

09:10.717 --> 09:14.654
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE
THAT I CANNOT DISAPPOINT,

09:14.688 --> 09:16.222
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO
FIGURE IT OUT.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.924
OKAY, SO IF THE GLASS
IS IN, THEN I CAN

09:18.024 --> 09:19.559
MAKE THE COMMERCIAL, AND THEN
WE CAN JUST ROCK AND ROLL.

09:19.592 --> 09:20.760
- YOU HAVE TO MAKE
THE COMMERCIAL.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.162
WE NEED TO SELL
THIS APARTMENT.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.297
THE TIME FOR PROCRASTINATION
IS OVER.

09:24.330 --> 09:27.033
IT'S GAME TIME NOW.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.042
- HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

09:36.042 --> 09:37.477
CAN I OFFER YOU GUYS
ANYTHING TO DRINK?

09:37.510 --> 09:38.878
- YEAH, I'LL HAVE
A GLASS OF RED.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.247
- RED, AND YOURSELF?
- SURE, THE SAME.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.252
IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS
SINCE DEREK'S ART EXHIBITION,

09:46.286 --> 09:48.388
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.727
- THAT'S LIKE--[laughs]
- WE--

09:53.760 --> 09:57.497
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THAT
OPTION'S ON THE BACK BURNER.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.666
SO I'VE GIVEN IT SOME TIME
FOR HIM TO CALM DOWN,

09:59.699 --> 10:03.903
FOR ME TO CALM DOWN, AND SEE
WHERE THINGS STAND NOW.

10:03.937 --> 10:08.508
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S...
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.343
- WELL, I THINK--
I MEAN,

10:10.377 --> 10:14.481
HAVE YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT
THROUGH WHAT WE'RE TAKING ON.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.883
- WELL, BABE, WE WENT
TO A SURROGACY AGENCY.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.351
WHERE LIKE,
WE STARTED THE PROCESS,

10:18.385 --> 10:20.820
WE STARTED, LIKE, TAKING STEPS.
- YEAH, WE INITIATED EVERYTHING.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.490
- I MEAN, WE TALKED ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW HOW EXCITED

10:23.523 --> 10:27.060
I THOUGHT WE WERE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

10:29.829 --> 10:32.665
- WHO IS GOING TO SIT AT HOME
RAISING THAT CHILD?

10:32.699 --> 10:34.501
- WELL, I'LL DO HALF OF IT,
AND YOU'LL DO THE OTHER HALF.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.835
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO
HALF OF IT?

10:35.869 --> 10:38.171
LOOK HOW MANY COMMITMENTS
YOU HAVE,

10:38.204 --> 10:39.372
AND WHEN THE BABY'S SICK--

10:39.406 --> 10:40.774
- BABY, SO I'LL
HAVE TO COMPROMISE.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.175
- YOU'LL HAVE TO COMPROMISE.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.643
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
IT'S LIKE--

10:43.677 --> 10:45.545
- YOU DO NOT COMPROMISE,
AND YOU NEVER WILL,

10:45.578 --> 10:48.314
AND I KNOW YOU.
- OVER MY OWN CHILD?

10:48.348 --> 10:53.453
- THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.689
I'M JUST ESTABLISHING
MYSELF HERE IN A NEW CITY.

10:55.722 --> 10:58.491
MY CAREER, I WANT TO ENJOY
PAINTING,

10:58.525 --> 11:01.161
AND TRYING TO GET MYSELF
UP TO A PLACE

11:01.194 --> 11:03.563
WHERE I FEEL INDEPENDENT.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.399
I DON'T WANT TO BE SOMEBODY
THAT BECOMES A HOUSEWIFE.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.869
- I MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.505
IT'S, LIKE, I UNDERSTAND
YOU WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT,

11:12.539 --> 11:13.840
AND I UNDERSTAND
YOU WANT TO, LIKE,

11:13.873 --> 11:17.243
YOU WANT ALL THOSE THINGS,
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.282
- I AM NOT PREPARED TO BE
A STAY-AT-HOME DAD.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.484
- WELL, IT'S VERY INTERESTING
TO ME YOU FEEL

11:24.517 --> 11:26.886
SO STRONGLY ALL ALONG, BUT
YOU HAVE NEVER VOICED IT TO ME.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.822
IT'S LIKE--
- WELL, I'M MAKING IT CLEAR NOW,

11:28.855 --> 11:32.592
BECAUSE YOU'VE ASKED ME.

11:32.625 --> 11:36.529
- BASICALLY, IT'S OVER.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.966
WE'VE GONE THROUGH
ALL THESE STEPS,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.602
AND HERE WE ARE.

11:42.635 --> 11:47.107
I'M NOT MAKING A DECISION.
HE IS, FOR US.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.846
[sighs]

11:54.014 --> 11:55.215
- RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE A DEAL
ON THE TABLE.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.282
YOU DON'T WANT TO LET
THAT GO.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.319
- I DON'T THINK HE'S BLUFFING.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.887
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

12:00.920 --> 12:01.888
- YOU'RE NOT
TRYING TO HELP ME.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.056
YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.057
- OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.135
- SKYVAULT IS READY,
FINALLY!

12:15.168 --> 12:18.304
FINALLY, I GET TO SEE
THE GLASS FLOOR

12:18.338 --> 12:22.375
IN MY SKY GARAGE PENTHOUSE,
FINALLY!

12:22.409 --> 12:27.113
I WILL CALL YOU RIGHT BACK.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.884
WHOA.

12:30.917 --> 12:31.918
JESUS.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.455
IS THIS SAFE?

12:35.488 --> 12:36.823
HELLO?

12:40.326 --> 12:41.728
YES!

12:41.761 --> 12:45.665
THIS...IS...AWESOME.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.407
WHOOP, WHOOP.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.010
AND NOW, IT'S TIME
TO FIRE UP THIS BAD BOY.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.311
UM--

13:00.080 --> 13:03.149
WHOOP. [gasps]

13:03.183 --> 13:05.485
IT'S ALIVE!

13:05.518 --> 13:07.587
[imitates whirring]

13:10.757 --> 13:13.893
THE GLASS DOORS ARE AWESOME,
AND WHEN IT'S DONE,

13:13.927 --> 13:17.063
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE
THE STAIRS INTO THE VAULT.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.499
OOH.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.234
W-W-WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WENT INTO AN APARTMENT

13:21.267 --> 13:23.603
THAT HAD, LIKE,
A MOVING GLASS FLOOR IN IT.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.505
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN ONE.
I DON'T KNOW,

13:25.538 --> 13:27.807
MAYBE YOU HAVE.
MAYBE YOU HAVE. I HAVEN'T.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.476
THIS IS INSANE.

13:29.509 --> 13:33.913
UNFORTUNATELY, EVERYTHING ELSE
IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

13:36.850 --> 13:40.587
BUT THAT'S OKAY,
BECAUSE THE GLASS FLOOR IS IN,

13:40.620 --> 13:42.288
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN
WAITING ON.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.990
[elevator bell dings]

13:44.090 --> 13:45.392
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:45.425 --> 13:46.960
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.
- YEAH.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.296
- THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE CHANGE
IN THE PRODUCTION COMPANY,

13:50.330 --> 13:53.299
BECAUSE THE AUSSIES
I WAS WITH BEFORE,

13:53.333 --> 13:54.968
THEY COULDN'T WAIT
FOR THE CONSTRUCTION TO FINISH

13:55.001 --> 13:57.337
LIKE I COULD, SO NOW I'VE GOT
A NEW PRODUCTION COMPANY,

13:57.370 --> 13:58.471
AND A NEW PLAN.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.839
- SO THIS IS THE THING
YOU WERE--

13:59.873 --> 14:01.074
- THIS IS THE SKYVAULT?
- THIS IS THE THING

14:01.107 --> 14:02.575
THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.644
THIS TOOK THEM A YEAR
TO DESIGN AND BUILD.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.347
- IT'S SUPER COOL.
IT'S VERY JAMES BOND.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.348
- YEAH.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.083
MY INITIAL IDEA
FOR THE COMMERCIAL

14:10.116 --> 14:12.285
WAS TO HAVE INTERNATIONAL BUYERS
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD

14:12.318 --> 14:15.055
CONVERGING ON THE APARTMENT
AT THE SAME TIME.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.657
I WANT THE GUY IN JAPAN
BOARDING A GULF STREAM,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.125
A GERMAN GUY
JUMPING ON A HELICOPTER.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.261
LAMBORGHINIS FLYING
THROUGH THE STREETS OF NEW YORK

14:21.294 --> 14:23.229
WITH, LIKE, POLICE CHASING THEM.
- [laughs]

14:23.263 --> 14:26.433
- BECAUSE OF THE TIME CRUNCH,
I HAVE TO SCALE BACK MY IDEA,

14:26.466 --> 14:28.068
WHICH IS OKAY,
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY LIKE

14:28.101 --> 14:29.736
MY NEW IDEA A LOT BETTER.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.806
SO THIS IS WHAT WE'LL WANT
TO SHOW, LIKE, AT THE END.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.408
I WANTED TO MAKE A COMMERCIAL
THAT TOLD A STORY,

14:35.442 --> 14:38.411
SO I CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA
THAT I WOULD SHOW

14:38.445 --> 14:41.281
A VERY WEALTHY COUPLE
GIVING EACH OTHER GIFTS,

14:41.314 --> 14:43.083
AND THEY KEEP
ONE-UPPING EACH OTHER.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.584
EVERYTHING ELSE
IN THE COMMERCIAL

14:44.617 --> 14:46.086
THE WAY WE TALKED ABOUT,
LIKE, THE NECKLACE,

14:46.119 --> 14:48.688
AND HELICOPTER,
OBVIOUSLY IS OUTSIDE OF HERE,

14:48.722 --> 14:51.624
AND, LIKE,
THIS IS THE FINAL GIFT.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.759
- IT'S COOL.
YOU KNOW, IT'S A COOL PLACE.

14:52.792 --> 14:53.927
THE CONCEPT'S COOL.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.862
- SO MAYBE WE'LL
HAVE TO DO SOME FURNITURE.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.697
- ABSOLUTELY GONNA HAVE TO HAVE
SOME FURNITURE.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.366
WE'LL MAKE IT LOOK AWESOME
FOR SURE.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.802
- AWESOME.
- SO LET'S TALK BUSINESS.

15:02.836 --> 15:05.271
WHAT KIND OF TIMELINE
ARE WE LOOKING AT?

15:05.305 --> 15:08.041
YOU SAID YOU WANT TO DO THIS--
- LIKE FRIDAY.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.443
- FRIDAY.
- YEAH.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.444
- RIGHT.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.246
- IT'S TUESDAY.
- YEAH.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.516
- NORMALLY, WE'D PREP
A JOB LIKE THIS FOR A MONTH.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.451
- SO WHAT'S THE ISSUE?

15:18.485 --> 15:19.919
- MONEY, BUDDY.
- IT'S ALL--

15:19.953 --> 15:21.521
- SO PUT A PROPOSAL TOGETHER,
AND SEND IT OVER,

15:21.554 --> 15:22.655
AND LET'S JUST DO THIS,
BUT I GOT TO DO THIS,

15:22.689 --> 15:24.924
LIKE, THIS WEEKEND
TO GET IT DONE.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.126
- OKAY.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.394
- NOW, THINGS ARE READY.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.896
NOW, I HAVE TO LIVE UP
TO MY EXPECTATIONS,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.931
SO LET'S DO THIS.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.233
OH, MY GOD, DID YOU JUST
HEAR IT CRACK?

15:33.266 --> 15:34.601
JUST KIDDING. JUST KIDDING.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.710
- SO WHAT'S ON TAP
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY?

15:43.743 --> 15:45.745
- WELL, WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THE BROOKLYN OPEN HOUSE.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.514
- OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.848
MM, WHAT IS THIS HERE?
- COME HERE.

15:48.882 --> 15:49.983
COME HERE. COME HERE.
COME HERE.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.384
- HI.

15:51.418 --> 15:55.789
- OKAY.
- [gasps] OH, NO.

15:55.822 --> 15:59.125
OKAY.
FOR MILA?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.661
- I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME
MILA WAS ON THE BACK BURNER.

16:01.695 --> 16:04.664
- NO, IT IS ON HIS--
NOT MINE, I MEAN--

16:04.698 --> 16:07.534
EVEN THOUGH DEREK HAS TOLD ME
HE'S NOT READY FOR A BABY YET,

16:07.567 --> 16:09.035
I'M PLUNGING FORWARD.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.670
I'M NOT DONE WITH IT.
I'M NOT DONE WITH IT.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.372
I WILL NEVER BE DONE WITH IT.
I CANNOT LET IT GO.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.408
WHEN I REALLY WANT SOMETHING,
THEN I USUALLY GET IT.

16:15.442 --> 16:19.212
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW.
CAN I HAVE THIS FOR MILA?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.382
OH, YES, THIS,
THAT'S REALLY CUTE.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.750
OH, MY GOD,
I GOT TO BUY THIS.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.485
OH, I LIKE THESE.
THESE ARE KIND OF FUN.

16:25.518 --> 16:26.486
- FREDRIK, WE NEED--
OKAY, SO THIS, I NEED THIS

16:26.519 --> 16:28.455
AND THIS.
THANK YOU.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.191
OH, IT SAYS "MOM, MOM." DO YOU
HAVE THESE WITH "DAD, DAD?"

16:31.224 --> 16:33.526
- [sighs] FREDRIK, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS AT ALL.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.330
- OKAY, SO OPEN HOUSE BROOKLYN,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT--

16:37.364 --> 16:40.867
WE NEED FAMILIES,
AND OTHER PEOPLE.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.436
TO SET A RECORD PRICE
IN PARK SLOPE,

16:43.470 --> 16:46.306
I NEED THIS BIG HOUSE,
THIS EMPTY, BIG HOUSE

16:46.339 --> 16:48.608
WITH STAGED FURNITURE
TO HAVE WARMTH.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.444
I WANT KIDS RUNNING AROUND,
PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.246
I'M SELLING A LIFESTYLE.
"WELCOME HOME,

16:53.279 --> 16:55.281
TO YOUR BIG HOUSE
FULL OF PEOPLE."

16:55.315 --> 16:57.183
- OKAY.
- AND ALSO, I HAVE THIS IDEA,

16:57.217 --> 17:01.254
LIKE, RIGHT? IT'S KIND OF
RELATED TO, YOU KNOW, MILA.

17:01.287 --> 17:04.024
- MM-HMM.
- IF I GET DEREK

17:04.057 --> 17:08.094
TO COME AND HELP, AND WE DO SOME
SORT OF ACTIVITY FOR THE KIDS,

17:08.128 --> 17:10.030
I SEE IT. I ENVISION IT.
ALL THOSE KIDS,

17:10.030 --> 17:11.865
DEREK, YES, PAINTING,
LIKE AN ART PROJECT,

17:11.898 --> 17:14.901
AND HE REALIZES
WE CAN BE DADS.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.737
HE'LL SEE HOW AMAZING
KIDS WOULD BE FOR US,

17:17.771 --> 17:19.939
AND I CAN SELL A HOUSE
AT THE SAME TIME.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.142
THIS IS GENIUS.
- PERFECT, DONE.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.843
WE'LL DO THE WHOLE THING.
WE'LL--

17:23.877 --> 17:26.279
OH.
- WHAT'S THE TOTAL?

17:26.312 --> 17:27.480
- $324.

17:31.317 --> 17:32.419
- SHH.

17:32.452 --> 17:35.755
FROM THE BACK BURNER
TO THE FRONT BURNER.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.631
- ABDEL NASSER,
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.499
- HELLO. HI.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, LUIS.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.068
- WE GOT GREAT NEWS.
WE ARE HERE

17:48.068 --> 17:50.236
BECAUSE WE HAVE DECIDED
THAT WE'RE GOING TO SUBMIT

17:50.270 --> 17:52.172
AN OFFER
FOR THE BEACH FRONT VILLA.

17:52.205 --> 17:55.208
- YOU KNOW WHAT IS VERY GOOD?
THE RAVIOLI, IT'S AMAZING.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.576
TWO DAYS AGO,
THEY NEVER SAW THEMSELVES

17:56.609 --> 17:58.411
LIVING IN PUERTO RICO,
AND HERE THEY ARE,

17:58.445 --> 18:00.747
READY TO SUBMIT AN OFFER
THAT'S VERY CLOSE TO ASKING.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.016
ALL RIGHT, SO AFTER WE SAW
THE PROPERTIES,

18:03.049 --> 18:05.652
THEY HAVE DECIDED THEY WANT
TO SUBMIT AN OFFER ON THE VILLA.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.020
THEY WANT TO OFFER 2.4,
WHICH WE BELIEVE

18:07.020 --> 18:09.022
IS AN EXTREMELY SOLID OFFER.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.523
YOU KNOW,
IT'S VERY CLOSE TO ASKING.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.025
THAT'S A CASH OFFER,
NO FINANCING.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.226
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.394
- I THINK THAT'S A GOOD OFFER,

18:14.427 --> 18:16.029
BUT I HAVE TO CALL THE OFFICE.
- OF COURSE.

18:16.029 --> 18:17.597
- JUST MAKE IT CLEAR
WE'RE READY TO MOVE FORWARD.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.933
WE CAN BRING THE KIDS HERE
NEXT WEEK.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.434
[laughter]

18:21.468 --> 18:24.738
- I AM VERY CONFIDENT THE 2.4
CAN GET THE SELLER'S ATTENTION.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.307
IT'S $100,000 UNDER ASKING,
AND IT SHOWS

18:27.340 --> 18:29.042
THAT MY CLIENTS
ARE EXTREMELY SERIOUS.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.610
[phone ringing]

18:30.643 --> 18:32.145
- HELLO?
- HELLO, HEY, RICARDO,

18:32.178 --> 18:34.881
IT'S ABDEL AND LUIS. WE ARE
IN A MEETING WITH THE JONES,

18:34.914 --> 18:37.584
AND THEY WANT TO MAKE AN OFFER
IN THE BEACHFRONT VILLA.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.053
THEY WANT TO OFFER
2.4 MILLIONS.

18:40.053 --> 18:42.322
- GREAT OFFER.
- IT'S A GREAT OFFER.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.301
- YES, BUT IT WILL BE
A QUICKLY CLOSING.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.870
THEY HAVE THE MONEY.
THEY HAVE THE CREDIT.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.505
THEY HAVE EVERYTHING
TO CLOSE THE PROPERTY.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.006
- RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE
A DEAL ON THE TABLE.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.241
YOU DON'T WANT
TO LET THAT GO.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.715
- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GO
TALK TO OUR CLIENTS,

19:08.748 --> 19:10.316
AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

19:10.350 --> 19:14.020
I DON'T THINK HE'S BLUFFING.
I REALLY NEED TO GET THEM UP.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.789
ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS THE DEAL:
UNFORTUNATELY,

19:15.822 --> 19:17.757
THEY'RE NOT DISCOUNTING
ANY OF THE PROPERTIES

19:17.791 --> 19:20.060
IN THE ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT.
IN FACT, THEY ARE ON THE PROCESS

19:20.093 --> 19:22.662
OF INCREASING THE UNITS
ON THE BEACHFRONT.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.400
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT ALMOST FEELS

19:27.434 --> 19:29.336
LIKE A LITTLE
USED CAR SALESMAN TECHNIQUE.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.210
- ACTION, CAR.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.712
- WE'RE UNDER THE GUN.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.947
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,
THEN ALL OF THAT MONEY

19:41.047 --> 19:42.115
HAS JUST BEEN WASTED.

19:42.148 --> 19:45.485
- LET IT GO, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S CUT.

19:53.827 --> 19:55.061
- ALL RIGHT,
SO THIS IS THE DEAL:

19:55.061 --> 19:57.263
UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY'RE NOT DISCOUNTING

19:57.297 --> 19:58.798
ANY OF THE PROPERTIES
IN THE ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT.

19:58.832 --> 20:00.066
IN FACT, THEY ARE
ON THE PROCESS

20:00.100 --> 20:02.669
OF INCREASING THE UNITS
ON THE BEACH FRONT.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.840
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT ALMOST FEELS

20:06.873 --> 20:08.208
LIKE A LITTLE
USED CAR SALESMAN TECHNIQUE.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.476
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
AND THAT'S A TECHNIQUE

20:09.509 --> 20:10.710
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE USE,
BUT IN THIS CASE,

20:10.744 --> 20:12.345
I THINK IT'S
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SCENARIO.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.814
I DON'T FEEL THAT HE'S BLUFFING.
I REALLY DON'T.

20:14.848 --> 20:18.718
- I PERSONALLY THINK YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK AND GET SOMETHING.

20:18.752 --> 20:20.253
- WE GOT TO FEEL LIKE WE GET
SOMETHING BACK.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.488
- ONE STEP AT A TIME.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.622
- EXCUSE ME.
- THANK YOU.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.957
- SOUNDS GOOD.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.558
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF I TELL HIM

20:25.592 --> 20:27.927
THAT HE'S BUYING APPLE
IN '95.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.696
HE NEEDS TO FEEL
THAT HE'S GETTING SOMETHING,

20:29.729 --> 20:31.965
SO I NEED TO TALK THE SELLERS
INTO GIVING THEM SOMETHING,

20:31.998 --> 20:33.133
JUST ANYTHING.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.368
[phone ringing]

20:36.403 --> 20:38.838
- HEY, RICARDO,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

20:38.872 --> 20:40.940
IF WE WERE TO COME IN
AT FULL ASKING,

20:40.974 --> 20:42.609
AND, YOU KNOW, MY CLIENTS
WANT TO FEEL WELCOME,

20:42.642 --> 20:44.110
WE GOT TO GIVE THEM
SOMETHING MORE.

20:57.457 --> 21:00.260
- AND ONE MORE THING,
HUSBAND IS A GOLFER.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.796
WE NEED AN UPGRADE
FOR THE CLUB MEMBERSHIP.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.433
- LET'S THROW HIM IN
ON A LIMITED SPA MEMBERSHIP.

21:16.142 --> 21:17.277
- LET ME GET BACK TO YOU.
- OKAY.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.278
THANK YOU, RICARDO.
- SEE YOU, RICARDO.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.746
THANK YOU, BYE.
- OKAY, BYE-BYE.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.716
- THE WAY TO MOST MEN'S HEART
IS THROUGH THEIR STOMACH.

21:22.749 --> 21:26.186
I THINK THE WAY INTO DR. JONES'S
HEART IS THROUGH GOLF.

21:26.219 --> 21:27.620
- OH, YOU'RE BACK.
- YOU'RE BACK.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.689
- YES, WE ARE.
- WE ARE, WE HAVE NEWS FOR YOU.

21:29.723 --> 21:31.091
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,

21:31.124 --> 21:33.760
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUDGE.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.395
NOT BECAUSE
THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO,

21:35.428 --> 21:36.830
YOU KNOW, TO MAKE YOU GUYS
FEEL WELCOME, BUT IT'S BECAUSE

21:36.863 --> 21:39.165
OF THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE
A VERY HIGH DEMAND

21:39.199 --> 21:40.633
FOR BEACHFRONT PROPERTIES,

21:40.667 --> 21:44.104
BUT THEY ARE WILLING TO THROW IN
ONE OF THE GOLF CARTS,

21:44.104 --> 21:47.741
A SIX-SEATER, AND AN UPGRADED
GOLF MEMBERSHIP.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.678
THE KICKER IS
THAT WE HAVE TO CLOSE TODAY.

21:54.614 --> 21:55.849
- TODAY?

21:59.619 --> 22:04.257
WELL...

22:04.290 --> 22:05.525
YOU KNOW, WE KIND OF
SOUL-SEARCHED,

22:05.558 --> 22:08.728
AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS
RIGHT WHERE WE WANT TO BE.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.066
- YOU WIN, LUIS.
- YOU WIN.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.434
[laughter]
- THERE YOU GO.

22:14.467 --> 22:15.669
- SO DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

22:15.702 --> 22:17.837
- WE HAVE A DEAL.
-<i>SALUD!</i>

22:17.871 --> 22:20.073
- TO THE NEW PUERTO RICANS, YES!
- YES.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.608
- I WANT THE CHAMPAGNE NOW.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.209
[laughter]

22:32.318 --> 22:34.621
- SO THIS IS THE HOUSE,
BABE.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.956
HONESTLY, IT'S UNUSUAL
FOR ME TO BRING DEREK,

22:36.990 --> 22:40.093
MY HUSBAND, TO WORK,
BUT I HAVE A CUNNING PLAN HERE.

22:40.126 --> 22:43.129
LOOK, THIS IS PERFECT, HERE.
- OH, THIS IS NICE.

22:43.163 --> 22:45.565
- I SENT AN EMAIL BLAST TO ALL
THE POTENTIAL BUYERS AND BROKERS

22:45.598 --> 22:47.767
FOR MY OPEN HOUSE/ART PARTY

22:47.801 --> 22:50.603
TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE
TO BRING THEIR KIDS.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.672
HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- THANK YOU.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.607
- IF DEREK SPENDS SOME TIME
WITH THE KIDS,

22:54.641 --> 22:56.910
AND DRAWS WITH THEM,
WHILE I SHOW THE PARENTS

22:56.943 --> 22:58.378
THE ACTUAL HOUSE...

22:58.411 --> 22:59.379
- HI.
- THIS IS SOPHIA AND JOSEPH.

22:59.412 --> 23:00.814
- HI, SOPHIA. HI, JOSEPH.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.216
MAYBE SOMETHING WILL CLICK
INSIDE OF HIM.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.685
HI, WELCOME.
GIVE ME FIVE.

23:05.719 --> 23:08.054
SO THIS IS A BIG, BIG HOUSE.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.289
YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE
DOWNSTAIRS TOO,

23:09.322 --> 23:10.590
WHICH IS REALLY COOL?

23:10.623 --> 23:12.592
DO YOU LIKE TO PAINT, DRAW?
- YES.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.060
- COME ON, LET'S GO.
LET'S DRAW.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.129
THIS IS UNCLE DEREK. HE'S--
- HI, GUYS.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.630
- HE'S, LIKE,
A REALLY BIG ARTIST,

23:17.664 --> 23:18.631
REALLY FAMOUS.
- HOW'S IT GOING?

23:18.665 --> 23:19.899
- DO YOU LIKE DRAWING?
- YEAH.

23:19.933 --> 23:21.067
- HE CAN TEACH YOU
EVERYTHING.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.669
OKAY, BYE, GUYS.
SO I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

23:22.702 --> 23:23.870
I'M JUST GONNA SHOW MOM
THE HOUSE.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.705
[doorbell ringing]

23:25.739 --> 23:27.507
HI, WELCOME.
- THANK YOU.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.708
- HI, I'M SO EXCITED
TO SEE THIS.

23:28.742 --> 23:29.809
- YES, COME IN,
COME IN, COME IN.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.077
ALL OF THIS IS ORIGINAL.

23:31.111 --> 23:32.712
THEY HAD TO TAKE
EACH AND EVERY TILE OUT,

23:32.746 --> 23:34.681
POLISH IT,
AND PUT IT BACK.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.883
IT'S NOT A RENOVATION,
IT'S A RESTORATION.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.852
- YOU GUYS READY
TO DO THE BOW TIE NOW?

23:38.885 --> 23:41.554
- COME ON, I WANT YOU TO MEET
ALL THE OTHER KIDS AND DRAW.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.590
- HEY, WHAT IS THAT?
- IT'S A TORNADO.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.692
- OH, IT'S A TORNADO.
- ISN'T IT GORGEOUS?

23:45.725 --> 23:46.893
OVER 100 YEARS OLD.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.130
FOR YOU WITH KIDS, RIGHT?
PERFECT KIDS ROOM.

23:50.163 --> 23:52.465
- OH, I HAVE TO LOOK.
I'M SORRY, I'M NOSY.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.467
- IT'S OKAY TO BE NOSY.
- IT'S LOCKED.

23:54.501 --> 23:55.568
- IS IT LOCKED?

23:55.602 --> 23:57.904
- [laughs] OH!
- OH, I'M SORRY. [gasps]

23:57.937 --> 24:01.341
OH, MY GOD, YOU SCARED ME.
I'M SORRY IN THERE,

24:01.374 --> 24:03.443
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT
OF A DISCOUNT MAYBE.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.378
[toilet flushing]
- LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ROOM.

24:05.412 --> 24:06.680
- OH.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.348
- WE'LL DO THE NEXT LINE HERE,

24:08.381 --> 24:11.384
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DIP IN,
A LITTLE GROOVE LIKE THAT,

24:11.418 --> 24:13.053
'CAUSE THIS IS WHERE
HIS EARS ARE GONNA GROW.

24:13.053 --> 24:15.288
- OH, THIS IS
GOING TO BE HARD.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.891
- NO, IT'S NOT GONNA BE HARD.
OKAY?

24:17.924 --> 24:20.126
- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.728
IT'S LIKE I CAN LOOK
INTO THE FUTURE,

24:21.761 --> 24:23.763
AND I CAN SEE HIM
WITH OUR KIDS.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.065
IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL TO ME,
BECAUSE I KNOW

24:25.098 --> 24:27.167
HE'S GOING TO BE
SUCH AN AMAZING DAD.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.902
HI, BABE.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.337
- HI, HANDSOME.
HI, HOW'S IT GOING?

24:30.370 --> 24:31.571
- HI.
- HI, THERE.

24:31.604 --> 24:34.140
- IS HE A GOOD ARTIST?
- [laughs]

24:34.174 --> 24:35.575
WELL, WE'RE TRYING.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.210
I THINK THEY'RE
BETTER ARTISTS THAN ME.

24:37.243 --> 24:40.480
- OKAY, LET THEM PLAY.
THEY'RE HAVING SO MUCH FUN.

24:40.513 --> 24:41.948
I THINK IT TURNED OUT GREAT,

24:41.981 --> 24:43.950
AND I'M NOT GOING TO PUSH HIM
ANYMORE NOW. I WON'T.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.085
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR--
- ALL RIGHT,

24:45.085 --> 24:46.086
YOU'RE WELCOME, HONEY.

24:47.087 --> 24:48.088
- OKAY, CIAO.
- BYE.

24:48.121 --> 24:49.289
- OKAY, CHEERS.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.791
- I WANT HIM TO COME
TO THE REALIZATION

24:51.825 --> 24:53.093
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT'S GOING TO BE GREAT

24:53.093 --> 24:55.195
FOR BOTH OF US,
SOMETHING THAT WE BOTH WANT

24:55.228 --> 24:56.930
SOON IN THE FUTURE.

24:56.963 --> 25:00.266
- WHOA.
I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.868
[laughs]
- ARE YOU EXHAUSTED?

25:01.901 --> 25:03.470
- YEAH, IT'S REALLY
ENTERTAINING. I MEAN,

25:03.503 --> 25:07.640
THEY GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE, DON'T THEY?

25:07.674 --> 25:08.742
- YEAH, THEY DO.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.243
- WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

25:10.276 --> 25:12.912
- THAT WAS REALLY NICE.
THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME OUT.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.614
I HAVE CRIED SO MUCH LATELY.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.416
WHAT IS UP
WITH ALL THIS ESTROGEN?

25:16.449 --> 25:18.318
- MMM.
- IT WAS SO NICE

25:18.351 --> 25:19.386
TO SEE YOU WITH THEM.

25:21.321 --> 25:24.057
- I WISH I WAS OVULATING.
[laughs]

25:24.057 --> 25:28.328
WOULDN'T THAT BE EASIER?
[laughs]

25:35.869 --> 25:38.438
- STARTS WITH THE HOOD MOUNT,
CAR COMES IN, RIDES UP.

25:38.471 --> 25:40.273
- YO, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- HEY, RYAN.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.408
- HOW WE DOING?
- HOW'S IT GOING?

25:41.441 --> 25:42.475
- SO YOU'RE LAYING FAKE FLOOR

25:42.509 --> 25:43.476
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S FLOOR?
- YEAH,

25:43.510 --> 25:45.178
THE FLOOR WASN'T DONE ALSO.

25:45.211 --> 25:49.149
- TODAY IS THE BIGGEST DAY
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, EVER.

25:49.182 --> 25:50.617
- SO LOOK, AT LEAST
THE VAULT IS OPENING.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.252
IT WORKS, AND WE'LL BE ABLE
TO GET WHAT WE NEED, RIGHT?

25:52.285 --> 25:54.521
WE GOT SOME FURNITURE TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE IT'S A HOME,

25:54.554 --> 25:55.755
AND THEN THE ACTORS ARE HERE
ALREADY?

25:55.789 --> 25:56.790
- ACTORS ARE HERE.

25:56.823 --> 25:59.759
- THIS IS COSTING ME
A SMALL FORTUNE.

25:59.793 --> 26:01.294
HI. RYAN.
- HI, JENNA.

26:01.327 --> 26:05.398
BUT IF IT WORKS, I'LL ATTRACT
BUYERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.340
THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME!

26:13.373 --> 26:15.208
[engine revving]

26:15.241 --> 26:17.811
I HAVE A FERRARI.
I HAVE A 25-PERSON CREW.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.446
I SHUT DOWN 11TH AVENUE.

26:19.479 --> 26:22.315
I HAVE POLICE ESCORTS,
A HELICOPTER,

26:22.349 --> 26:23.583
AND THERE'S PROBABLY
TEN OTHER THINGS THAT I'M NOT

26:23.616 --> 26:26.086
EVEN THINKING ABOUT,
AND I PAID FOR THOSE TOO.

26:26.119 --> 26:28.388
- GO! GO AHEAD
AND ROLL THE CAMERA,

26:28.421 --> 26:31.725
CAMERA SPEED!
- SCENE 102, TAKE ONE.

26:31.758 --> 26:35.061
- AND ACTION, CAR.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.464
- THAT'S REALLY COOL.

26:39.065 --> 26:42.068
- ALL RIGHT, RESET!
- SCENE 102, TAKE TWO.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.903
ACTION, CAR.

26:43.937 --> 26:46.506
LET'S DO ONE AGAIN. THIS TIME,
I'M GONNA HAVE YOU COME CLOSER.

26:46.539 --> 26:49.075
- THINGS I'M LEARNING
AS A PRODUCER...

26:49.075 --> 26:51.077
- ACTION! CUT! ACTION!

26:51.077 --> 26:54.114
- THINGS JUST TAKE FOREVER.

26:54.147 --> 26:55.815
- ACTION.
- HE'S IN MY SHOT.

26:55.849 --> 26:57.117
- LET'S CUT.

26:57.150 --> 27:01.388
- THIS IS LIKE SIX HOURS
TO FILM THE CAR GO LIKE THIS,

27:01.421 --> 27:07.027
FROM HERE TO HERE,
TO HERE, TO HERE, TO HERE,

27:07.060 --> 27:10.430
TO HERE.
UM--

27:10.463 --> 27:13.333
- WE NEED ONE MORE SHOT
FROM BEHIND.

27:13.366 --> 27:14.601
- [bleep]

27:14.634 --> 27:16.369
- YOU GUYS READY?
- GO AHEAD AND ROLL CAMERA.

27:16.403 --> 27:18.638
- AS A PRODUCER, I'M THE ONE
SPENDING ALL THE MONEY.

27:18.672 --> 27:19.906
HONESTLY, LIKE,
WE'RE UNDER THE GUN.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.374
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,

27:21.408 --> 27:23.777
THEN ALL OF THAT MONEY
HAS JUST BEEN WASTED.

27:23.810 --> 27:27.147
- 104, TAKE TWO. MARKING.
ALL RIGHT, MAN.

27:27.180 --> 27:28.882

27:52.172 --> 27:55.375
ALL THE PRESSURE AND TENSION

27:55.408 --> 27:57.510
I'VE HAD THIS IDEA
THAT'S IN MY BRAIN,

27:57.544 --> 27:59.379
AND NOW, IT'S, LIKE, HERE,

27:59.412 --> 28:00.580
AND THERE'S ALL THESE PEOPLE,

28:00.613 --> 28:03.283
WORKING TOGETHER,
AND NO BROKER IN THE WORLD

28:03.316 --> 28:08.488
MAKES A LISTING VIDEO
WITH HELICOPTER AND ACTORS,

28:08.521 --> 28:09.856
AND SPENDS TENS,
AND TENS, AND TENS

28:09.889 --> 28:11.391
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON IT.
NO ONE DOES THAT.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.393
NO ONE DOES THAT,
EXCEPT FOR ME.

OH, THERE IT GOES!

28:15.328 --> 28:18.064

AND BACK TO NEW YORK, I'M
GOING TO SPEND MY LAST EVENING

28:48.194 --> 28:49.596
WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE
IN MY LIFE...

28:49.629 --> 28:50.697
<i>PAPI.</i>

28:50.730 --> 28:51.931
MY FAMILY.

28:51.965 --> 28:53.266

I MISS YOU A LOT.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.168

EVERYBODY GETS TOGETHER.
EVERYBODY GETS DRUNK.

29:05.812 --> 29:08.014
EVERYBODY DANCES.
EVERYBODY IS RUNNING AROUND.

29:08.048 --> 29:09.582
- HEY!

29:09.616 --> 29:11.918
- AND IT'S VERY HARD
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO MY FAMILY,

29:12.018 --> 29:13.453
BUT NEW YORK IS CALLING.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.255
I WANT TO MAKE A TOAST.

29:15.288 --> 29:16.489
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE.

29:16.523 --> 29:18.258
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW HARD YOU WORK.

29:18.291 --> 29:19.893
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
THINGS THAT YOU DO IN LIFE.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.228
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS.
IT COMES DOWN TO FAMILY,

29:22.262 --> 29:26.032
AND I AM THE PROUDEST MEMBER
OF THE MOST AMAZING FAMILY

29:26.032 --> 29:27.701
THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.

<i>- SALUD.</i>

29:40.780 --> 29:41.915
- OKAY.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.049
- SO YOU'RE GONNA BOOK THAT
WITH HIM,

29:43.083 --> 29:44.818
12:15 TOMORROW.
- YES, IT'S GONNA BE--

29:44.851 --> 29:46.820
MY OPEN HOUSE IN BROOKLYN
FOR THE FAMILIES

29:46.853 --> 29:48.488
WAS A BIG SUCCESS,
AND I'M FOLLOWING UP

29:48.521 --> 29:50.490
WITH EVERY BROKER AND BUYER
THAT WAS THERE.

29:50.523 --> 29:53.159
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'VE ALSO SCHEDULED

29:53.193 --> 29:54.961
A MEETING WITH LUIS.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.696
I CALLED HIM IN. HE'S ACTUALLY
ON HIS WAY IN NOW.

29:56.730 --> 29:57.831
I'M WANT TO, YOU KNOW,
TALK TO HIM.

29:57.864 --> 30:00.066
I JUST THINK I COULD MAYBE--

30:00.066 --> 30:01.668
- YOU COULD LEND
SOME ADVICE TO HIM.

30:01.701 --> 30:03.703
- I KNOW LUIS JUST GOT BACK
FROM A BIG TRIP

30:03.737 --> 30:05.739
TO PUERTO RICO.
WHILE HE WAS GONE,

30:05.772 --> 30:08.141
I WAS LOOKING OVER HIS SALES
HERE AT DOUGLAS ELLIMAN

30:08.174 --> 30:10.243
AND ALL OF THEM
HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.778
I THINK HE CAN DO BETTER

30:11.811 --> 30:13.713
IF HE WOULD JUST COME TO ME
FOR ADVICE.

30:13.747 --> 30:17.083
YOU KNOW WHAT, HE REMINDS ME
OF ROBIN IF I WAS BATMAN.

30:17.117 --> 30:21.521
LAST YEAR, LUIS AND I HAD
A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS.

30:21.554 --> 30:22.689
IT WASN'T EASY.

30:22.722 --> 30:23.757
- I SWEAR TO GOD, MAN,

30:23.790 --> 30:26.760
YOU DISGUSTING [bleep]
MOTHER[bleep]!

30:26.793 --> 30:28.261
YOU'RE A [bleep] DISGRACE!

30:28.294 --> 30:29.596
- I WANT TO GET MYSELF
IN THERE.

30:29.629 --> 30:31.364
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
I WANT TO MOLD HIM,

30:31.398 --> 30:33.033
AND BUILD
A LITTLE MINI FREDRIK.

30:33.066 --> 30:34.567
- BUT WE CAN
AT LEAST LET FELICIA KNOW.

30:34.601 --> 30:36.269
- HELLO.
- HI.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.038
- HEY.
- HOW WAS PUERTO RICO?

30:38.071 --> 30:39.239
- IT WAS AMAZING.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.107
FREDRIK ASKED ME
TO DROP BY HIS OFFICE.

30:41.141 --> 30:42.342
- HAVE A SEAT.

30:42.375 --> 30:44.310
- HE'S BEEN TRYING VERY HARD
TO BE A FRIEND.

30:44.344 --> 30:47.647
- LUIS, I'M YOUR FRIEND.
I MEAN, IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

30:47.681 --> 30:49.249
- AND I DON'T THINK
I'M ACTUALLY READY FOR THAT.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.684
- I WANTED TO HAVE A MEETING,

30:50.717 --> 30:52.986
'CAUSE I WANT TO SEE
HOW YOU'RE DOING.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.021
- VERY GOOD.
I'M KILLING IT OUT THERE.

30:55.055 --> 30:56.690
- REALLY?

30:56.723 --> 30:59.426
I SENT OUT CONTRACTS THIS WEEK
FOR $48 MILLION.

31:01.695 --> 31:02.796
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS WHY IT'S SO HARD

31:02.829 --> 31:04.264
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH FREDRIK.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.599
WHAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH
IS VERY CONDESCENDING.

31:06.633 --> 31:08.068
- IT'S NOT--I'M NOT--
I'M BRAGGING,

31:08.068 --> 31:09.336
I JUST,
I WANT TO INSPIRE YOU.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.137
I DIDN'T HIRE YOU
AT THIS COMPANY,

31:11.171 --> 31:14.741
BUT I FEEL INVESTED
IN YOUR FUTURE HERE.

31:14.774 --> 31:16.309
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH.

31:18.745 --> 31:20.213
- IT'S, YOU KNOW--

31:22.916 --> 31:24.384
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST USE ME?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

31:24.417 --> 31:26.953
LIKE, JUST, I'M HERE.
LIKE, YOU UNDERSTAND

31:26.986 --> 31:28.455
WHAT'S IN THIS BRAIN
WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ESTATE?

31:28.488 --> 31:31.725
- I DON'T KNOW, LISTEN,
I-I-I'LL BE FRANK WITH YOU.

31:31.758 --> 31:33.760
I--YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR,
IT ALMOST FELT THE SAME,

31:33.793 --> 31:35.295
THAT YOU WANTED
TO REALLY HELP ME,

31:35.328 --> 31:36.996
AND THINGS TURNED AROUND.

31:37.097 --> 31:38.998
I STILL HAVE
A HARD TIME TRUSTING.

31:39.099 --> 31:41.334
- I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK--
I ALREADY APOLOGIZED.

31:41.368 --> 31:43.103
I SAW THE REALLY UGLY SIDE
OF MYSELF.

31:43.136 --> 31:44.337
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT
EVER AGAIN,

31:44.371 --> 31:46.106
AND I WANT YOU
TO DO REALLY WELL.

31:46.106 --> 31:47.607
WHY IS THAT SO HARD
FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND?

31:50.510 --> 31:52.545
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

31:52.579 --> 31:55.181
YOU ARE HESITANT,
'CAUSE YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

31:55.215 --> 31:58.685
TO PROVE TO YOU THAT IT'S

31:58.718 --> 32:01.388
AN HONEST ATTEMPT
TO BE FRIENDS,

32:01.421 --> 32:03.056
LEARN FROM EACH OTHER,
WORK TOGETHER,

32:03.056 --> 32:05.191
WHY DON'T I GIVE YOU--
WELL, US--SOMETHING?

32:05.225 --> 32:06.826
WHAT IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU WOULD FEEL,

32:06.860 --> 32:09.429
LIKE, REALLY EXCITED ABOUT?

32:09.462 --> 32:13.266
- UM...I WOULD LIKE BE
A PART OF--I WOULD LIKE

32:13.299 --> 32:16.436
TO LEARN THE ASPECTS
OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

32:16.469 --> 32:20.707
- NEW DEVELOPMENT, HMM.

32:20.740 --> 32:21.875
WELL, I HAVE ONE THING.

32:21.908 --> 32:23.610
I HAVE THIS CLIENT
OUT IN BROOKLYN.

32:23.643 --> 32:24.944
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT
FOR YOU TO MEET HER.

32:24.978 --> 32:28.214
SHE DOES NEW DEVELOPMENT.
- OKAY.

32:28.248 --> 32:30.650
- I'M NOT GONNA BRING LUIS
ONTO MY TOWNHOUSE LISTING

32:30.684 --> 32:32.552
IN BROOKLYN,
BECAUSE I DID AN OPEN HOUSE,

32:32.585 --> 32:36.089
AND I HAVE BUYERS
LINED UP NOW, SO I'M THINKING

32:36.089 --> 32:38.758
JEANNE HAS MORE NEW
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS COMING UP,

32:38.792 --> 32:41.661
AND THAT, THAT COULD BE
A GREAT INTRODUCTION FOR LUIS.

32:41.695 --> 32:43.396
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
HOW A NEW DEVELOPMENT WORKS,

32:43.430 --> 32:44.798
START TO FINISH.

32:44.831 --> 32:47.467
- I THINK THAT I'M READY
TO WORK WITH DEVELOPERS

32:47.500 --> 32:48.702
LIKE ZACH VELLA.

32:48.735 --> 32:51.104

AT JUST SHY OF $40 MILLION.

32:51.104 --> 32:52.405
- A RECORD IN TRIBECA.

32:52.439 --> 32:56.276
- UM, OKAY, LET'S DO IT.
- THANK YOU.

32:56.309 --> 32:58.278
- YEAH, I'M EXCITED,
ACTUALLY.

33:06.886 --> 33:09.756
[party chatter]

33:09.789 --> 33:11.257
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

33:11.291 --> 33:12.792
- HI. HI.

33:12.826 --> 33:14.127

EMILIA.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.428

33:15.462 --> 33:16.529
- THE DAY IS FINALLY HERE.

33:16.563 --> 33:18.865
IT'S LIKE MY REAL ESTATE
WEDDING DAY.

33:18.898 --> 33:20.867
IT'S A GOOD NIGHT
FOR A MOVIE, RIGHT?

33:20.900 --> 33:22.302
- YEAH.
- A LITTLE ACTION FLICK.

33:22.335 --> 33:24.671
AND THE BEST WAY
TO MAKE A SPLASH

33:24.704 --> 33:27.207
IS TO REALLY MAKE A SPLASH.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.175
HEY, RYAN.
HOW ARE YOU?

33:29.209 --> 33:30.176
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

33:30.210 --> 33:31.177
- THANK YOU FOR COMING.

33:31.211 --> 33:32.512
SO I INVITED
EVERY TOP BROKER THERE.

33:32.545 --> 33:33.713
HI. HI.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

33:33.747 --> 33:35.081
- WE'VE GOT
OTHER DEVELOPERS THERE...

33:35.081 --> 33:36.683
THESE ARE JUST THE RENDERINGS,

33:36.716 --> 33:38.585
SO NOW, WE HAVE THE COMMERCIAL,
WHICH WE'RE PREMIERING.

33:38.618 --> 33:40.086
AND A LOT OF PRESS.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.688
WE GAVE THE EXCLUSIVE
TO CNBC,

33:41.721 --> 33:44.791
SO CNBC IS BEHIND YOU
FILMING THIS,

33:44.824 --> 33:47.193
AND WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE
THE COMMERCIAL ON<i>SQUAWK BOX</i>

33:47.227 --> 33:49.229
BECAUSE THAT IS
ON EVERY SINGLE SCREEN

33:49.262 --> 33:51.564
ON EVERY TRADING FLOOR
AROUND THE WORLD,

33:51.598 --> 33:54.200
SO I THINK MAYBE
THAT'S WHY I'M SWEATING.

33:54.234 --> 33:56.836
I'M INCREDIBLY
CONFIDENT IN WHAT WE DID.

33:56.870 --> 33:59.105
I WOULDN'T BE RELEASING IT
IF I WASN'T HAPPY WITH IT,

33:59.105 --> 34:02.575
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I'M PRETTY NERVOUS.

34:02.609 --> 34:05.845
I HAVE, LIKE, BUTTERFLIES
FOR THIS RIGHT NOW.

34:05.879 --> 34:07.247
- IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.916

34:14.854 --> 34:17.424
IS EVERYBODY READY?
EVERYBODY WANT TO GO INSIDE?

34:17.457 --> 34:20.060
I PERSONALLY BANKROLLED
ALL OF THE MARKETING,

34:20.093 --> 34:22.062
AND IT HAS TO WORK.

34:22.062 --> 34:24.197
- SHH.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.199
- I KNOW I MADE A BIG FUSS
ABOUT BRINGING YOU

[laughs] DARLING,

34:32.105 --> 34:35.575
IT'S EXQUISITE,

34:35.608 --> 34:37.744
IS SOMETHING EVEN BETTER.

34:37.777 --> 34:40.747
[slow hip-hop music]

34:40.780 --> 34:42.716

34:42.749 --> 34:44.317
SURPRISE.

34:44.351 --> 34:46.586

34:49.823 --> 34:51.991

34:52.092 --> 34:54.160
I'LL DRIVE.

34:54.194 --> 35:02.202

35:10.210 --> 35:12.245
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

35:12.278 --> 35:16.249

THERE'S NOTHING BETTER.

35:16.282 --> 35:21.554
[cheers and applause]
- OH!

35:21.588 --> 35:23.456
OKAY.
EVERYBODY LIKE IT?

35:23.490 --> 35:25.425
[all cheering]

35:25.458 --> 35:27.260
THEY LIKED IT. I MEAN,
PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY, LIKE,

35:27.293 --> 35:28.261
HOOTIN' AND HOLLERIN'.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.896
[all cheering]

35:29.929 --> 35:32.732
I THOUGHT A ROOM FULL OF BROKERS
AND WEALTHY PEOPLE

35:32.766 --> 35:34.134
MIGHT GIVE ME,
LIKE, LITTLE GOLF CLAPS,

35:34.167 --> 35:36.403
BUT, NO, PEOPLE
WERE LIKE "OH, YEAH!"

35:36.436 --> 35:39.172
PENTHOUSE ONE AT 211
FOR $23 MILLION

35:39.205 --> 35:40.240
IS ON THE MARKET NOW!

35:40.273 --> 35:42.442
[cheers and applause]
LET'S GO!

35:42.475 --> 35:44.978
IT'S AWESOME. IT'S EVERYTHING
THAT I COULD'VE HOPED FOR,

35:45.078 --> 35:48.581
SO I'M INCREDIBLY, INCREDIBLY
THANKFUL AND RELIEVED.

35:48.615 --> 35:50.617
NOW, IT'S GO TIME.
NOW, I HAVE TO SELL IT,

35:50.650 --> 35:52.919
AND SOMETIMES, IT TAKES TIME
TO SELL BIG APARTMENTS,

35:52.952 --> 35:54.821
BUT I THINK
I'M GONNA GET THERE.

35:54.854 --> 35:56.089
SHOULD WE WATCH IT AGAIN?

35:56.122 --> 35:58.658
[laughter]

36:05.732 --> 36:07.500
- JEANNE?
- HI, FREDRIK.

36:07.534 --> 36:09.169
- OH, THERE YOU ARE,
IN THE KITCHEN.

36:09.202 --> 36:11.171
JEANNE HAS AGREED TO MEET
WITH ME AND LUIS TODAY

36:11.204 --> 36:13.940
TO TALK ABOUT FUTURE
POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS,

36:14.040 --> 36:15.141
WHICH IS ACTUALLY
REALLY NICE OF HER.

36:15.175 --> 36:17.077
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR TAKING THIS MEETING.

36:17.110 --> 36:18.244
- SURE.
- IT REALLY MEANS A LOT.

36:18.278 --> 36:19.512
HE'S ON HIS WAY ACTUALLY.

36:19.546 --> 36:21.348
I HAVEN'T EVEN SOLD
THIS ONE YET,

36:21.381 --> 36:22.615
SO IT SAYS A LOT
ABOUT HER,

36:22.649 --> 36:24.451
AND HOW MUCH TRUST
SHE'S PUTTING IN ME.

36:24.484 --> 36:26.486
- HIS NAME IS LUIS.
HE'S UP-AND-COMING.

36:26.519 --> 36:29.589
HE REALLY IS DYING
TO GET INTO NEW DEVELOPMENT.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.224
- OKAY.
- AND MAYBE, MAYBE, MAYBE

36:31.257 --> 36:33.626
I CAN WORK WITH HIM,
WITH YOU ON YOUR FUTURE THINGS.

36:33.660 --> 36:35.929
HE HAS AN AMAZING ENERGY.
- ENERGY IS GOOD.

36:35.962 --> 36:36.930
I LIKE ENERGY.
- YES.

36:36.963 --> 36:38.398
- THAT GETS STUFF DONE.

36:38.431 --> 36:40.967
- I REALLY BELIEVE IN HIM, AND
I DO REALLY, REALLY LIKE HIM.

36:41.067 --> 36:42.869
- IF IT'S A GOOD ADDITION,

36:42.902 --> 36:45.271
AND HE CAN BRING SOMETHING
TO THE TABLE, SURE.

36:48.074 --> 36:49.075
[doorbell ringing]

36:49.075 --> 36:50.543
- TODAY'S A VERY EXCITING DAY.

36:50.577 --> 36:54.180
FREDRIK HAS INVITED ME
TO MEET A NEW DEVELOPER.

36:54.214 --> 36:56.316
- HEY, COME IN. HI.
- HELLO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:56.349 --> 36:57.350
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

36:57.384 --> 36:58.818
- I LOVE THAT SUIT.
- HOW ARE YOU?

36:58.852 --> 37:00.520
- HI, HELLO.
- LUIS ORTIZ, NICE TO MEET YOU.

37:00.553 --> 37:01.921
PLEASURE IS MINE.
HOW ARE YOU?

37:02.022 --> 37:03.790
- LET'S SIT DOWN, AND--
- ABSOLUTELY.

37:03.823 --> 37:05.058
- SO IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,
LUIS.

37:05.091 --> 37:07.327
- LIKEWISE.
- FREDRIK HAS TOLD ME

37:07.360 --> 37:13.199
A LOT ABOUT YOU, AND FREDRIK
SAID YOU'RE UP-AND-COMING.

37:13.233 --> 37:15.702
- UP-AND-COMING?

37:15.735 --> 37:18.238
I DIDN'T GET MY REAL ESTATE
LICENSE YESTERDAY, ALL RIGHT?

37:18.271 --> 37:20.473
- AND THAT YOU'RE SORT OF
LOOKING TO BE

37:20.507 --> 37:21.775
A LITTLE "MINI-FREDRIK."

37:24.077 --> 37:26.513
- I MEAN, YOU ARE SMALLER.
- [laughs]

37:26.546 --> 37:29.749
- THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DON'T
WANT TO DO THINGS WITH FREDRIK.

37:29.783 --> 37:32.452
WELL, I'M NOT REALLY
UP-AND-COMING,

37:32.485 --> 37:34.087
BUT I WANT TO LEARN,
OF COURSE,

37:34.120 --> 37:35.789
AND I ALSO HAVE SOMETHING GREAT
TO BRING TO THE TABLE.

37:35.822 --> 37:38.258
I'M NOT JUST HERE TO ASSIST.

37:38.291 --> 37:40.760
I'M HAPPY I'M HERE, AND
I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT YOUR--

37:40.794 --> 37:42.162
YOU KNOW,
WHAT YOUR NEXT PROJECT IS.

37:42.195 --> 37:44.831
- SO JEANNE BOUGHT THIS HOUSE

37:44.864 --> 37:48.868
AND SHE HAS RENOVATED IT,

37:48.902 --> 37:50.770
AND I'M NOW SELLING IT.

37:50.804 --> 37:53.473
HAVEN'T SOLD IT YET.

37:53.506 --> 37:58.345
- I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
SO SHE FLIPS TOWNHOUSES?

37:58.378 --> 37:59.879
I THOUGHT
SHE WAS A DEVELOPER.

37:59.913 --> 38:02.215
THIS IS THE LISTING? THIS IS--
WELL, YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB.

38:02.248 --> 38:03.817
I MEAN,
IT LOOKS VERY BEAUTIFUL,

38:03.850 --> 38:05.318
AND IT'S VERY HARD
TO FIND TOWNHOUSES LIKE THIS

38:05.352 --> 38:08.288
IN MANHATTAN, SO...
- WE'RE IN PARK SLOPE.

38:08.321 --> 38:10.924
[laughter]

38:12.325 --> 38:14.227
- I'M SAYING, IT'S HARD TO FIND
TOWNHOUSES LIKE THIS

38:14.260 --> 38:15.595
IN MANHATTAN.
- RIGHT.

38:15.628 --> 38:17.197
- WHAT THE [bleep]
IS THIS GUY'S PROBLEM?

38:17.230 --> 38:18.898
DID HE BRING ME HERE
SO THAT HE CAN LAUGH AT ME

38:18.932 --> 38:21.167
IN FRONT OF HIS CLIENT?
THAT'S NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

38:21.201 --> 38:23.570
UM, YEAH, I GUESS, YOU KNOW--

38:23.603 --> 38:26.439
- SHE HAS A GREAT TRACK RECORD,
GREAT DEVELOPER.

38:26.473 --> 38:28.575
- OKAY.
- INTERESTING FUTURE,

38:28.608 --> 38:30.477
INTERESTING STUFF COMING.

38:30.510 --> 38:32.045
CAN YOU GIVE US,
LIKE, A LITTLE DETAIL

38:32.078 --> 38:34.247
OF WHAT'S COMING UP? 'CAUSE
I WANT TO GET HIM EXCITED.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.516
- YES, THERE IS
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY

38:36.549 --> 38:37.817
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

38:37.851 --> 38:39.786
- IS IT--IS IT
A CONDOMINIUM BUILDING?

38:39.819 --> 38:42.789
- NO, IT'S--
- IS IT A BIGGER TOWNHOUSE?

38:42.822 --> 38:44.391
- YEAH,
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON.

38:44.424 --> 38:46.793
- MANSION, RIGHT?
- MAYBE A MINI-MANSION.

38:46.826 --> 38:48.294
- WOW.
- YEAH.

38:48.328 --> 38:49.396
- A TOWNHOUSE? NO.

38:49.429 --> 38:51.398
LISTEN, I HAVE DONE
TOWNHOUSES BEFORE.

38:51.431 --> 38:52.766
I'M TALKING
ABOUT A BIG DEVELOPMENT,

38:52.799 --> 38:54.834
SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND UP,
MULTIPLE UNITS.

38:54.868 --> 38:57.537
HE KNOWS WHAT I WANT.

38:57.570 --> 39:00.140
SO NOW,
IT'S BECOMING VERY AWKWARD.

39:02.008 --> 39:03.043
- LOOK YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR.
- "LOOK AT YOURSELF

39:03.076 --> 39:04.044
IN THE MIRROR"?
- CHECK, CHECK YOUR ATTIT--

39:04.077 --> 39:05.078
- LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE MIRROR.

39:05.111 --> 39:06.146
- YEAH, I WILL,
AND I'M GONNA SEE

39:06.179 --> 39:07.480
SOMEONE TRYING TO HELP
SOMEONE ELSE.

39:07.514 --> 39:09.015
- YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
SOME [bleep] SELFISH BITCH.

39:09.015 --> 39:10.316
- OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.

39:17.090 --> 39:19.025
- CAN YOU GIVE US,
LIKE, A LITTLE DETAIL

39:19.025 --> 39:21.127
OF WHAT'S COMING UP? 'CAUSE
I WANT TO GET HIM EXCITED.

39:21.161 --> 39:23.496
- YES, THERE IS
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY

39:23.530 --> 39:24.898
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

39:24.931 --> 39:26.266
- IS IT GONNA BE A TOWNHOUSE?

39:26.299 --> 39:28.168
- YEAH,
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON.

39:28.201 --> 39:29.869
- WOW.

39:32.038 --> 39:33.873
- OKAY.
I WAS ACTUALLY VERY EXCITED

39:33.907 --> 39:35.442
TO HEAR--YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
THERE WAS A NEW DEVELOPMENT

39:35.475 --> 39:38.411
THAT YOU WERE BUILDING.

39:38.445 --> 39:40.880
I WAS--
YEAH, I'M SORRY.

39:40.914 --> 39:43.950
YOU KNOW, IT'S A--IT'S
A GOOD BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY,

39:44.050 --> 39:46.453
BUT IN THIS CASE,
I WAS THINKING SOMETHING ELSE.

39:46.486 --> 39:47.821
- WHAT?

39:47.854 --> 39:49.889
LUIS, PLEASE DON'T EMBARRASS ME
IN FRONT OF MY CLIENT.

39:49.923 --> 39:51.825
- IF I'M HONEST WITH YOU,
I AM VERY INTERESTED

39:51.858 --> 39:53.693
IN NEW DEVELOPMENT.
YOU KNOW, HE'S BEEN DOING

39:53.727 --> 39:55.362
ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS,
11 NORTH MOORE,

39:55.395 --> 39:57.063
YOU KNOW, 250 BOWERY.
- MM-HMM.

39:57.097 --> 39:58.965
- WHEN WE SAT DOWN,
AND HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW,

39:59.065 --> 40:00.066
I WANT YOU TO MEET THIS PERSON.
SHE'S DOING,

40:00.100 --> 40:01.534
YOU KNOW,
THESE BIG PROJECTS--"

40:01.568 --> 40:03.737
- BUT DON'T FOCUS ON THE SIZE
TOO MUCH AT THE BEGINNING.

40:03.770 --> 40:05.805
THE FIRST PROJECT OR TWO,
IT'S MORE ABOUT,

40:05.839 --> 40:09.409
LIKE, STAYING IN THE BACKGROUND
BUT LEARNING.

40:09.442 --> 40:11.478
IT'S ALL ABOUT BUILDING
A RELATIONSHIP

40:11.511 --> 40:12.879
WITH YOUR DEVELOPER.

40:12.912 --> 40:14.881
JEANNE HAS DONE BIGGER PROJECTS
IN THE PAST.

40:14.914 --> 40:16.449
THAT'S WHAT LUIS
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

40:16.483 --> 40:18.685
WE MIGHT START
WITH A TOWNHOME,

40:18.718 --> 40:20.987
BUT WE MIGHT END UP
WITH A NEW EMPIRE STATE BUILDING

40:21.021 --> 40:22.555
TOGETHER.
ZACH VELLA AND I STARTED

40:22.589 --> 40:25.725
YEARS AND YEARS AGO
WITH A FIVE UNIT SMALL BUILDING

40:25.759 --> 40:28.828
IN TRIBECA, AND LOOK AT HIM,
LOOK AT US NOW.

40:28.862 --> 40:30.530
- WELL, LISTEN, I'M ALWAYS
LEARNING AT ALL TIMES...

40:30.563 --> 40:32.165
- OF COURSE.
- BUT THIS IS SOMETHING

40:32.198 --> 40:34.067
THAT I'VE DONE BEFORE
WITH SELLERS

40:34.100 --> 40:36.503
THAT TAKE TOWNHOUSES,
RENOVATE THEM,

40:36.536 --> 40:38.705
AND SELL THEM AFTERWARDS.
- OKAY.

40:38.738 --> 40:39.973
- I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HER
AS A CLIENT,

40:40.006 --> 40:41.241
IF I'M WORKING BY MYSELF.

40:41.274 --> 40:43.410
IF I'M GONNA PUT UP
WITH FREDRIK'S [bleep],

40:43.443 --> 40:45.745
IT BETTER BE
A MASSIVE, NEW DEVELOPMENT,

40:45.779 --> 40:48.481
NOT A $4 MILLION TOWNHOUSE
IN BROOKLYN.

40:48.515 --> 40:49.716
- I DON'T KNOW, FREDRIK.

40:49.749 --> 40:52.018
- GUYS, SEE THIS
AS A FIRST INTRODUCTION.

40:52.052 --> 40:54.020
WE'LL TALK.
WE'LL, YOU AND I TALK...

40:54.054 --> 40:56.489
- RIGHT.
- AND THEN, LET'S REGROUP.

40:56.523 --> 40:59.225
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

40:59.259 --> 41:00.427
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR HAVING US.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.429
- HE IS MISUNDERSTANDING
THE WHOLE THING.

41:02.462 --> 41:04.931
HE WANTS ZACH VELLA
AND 11 NORTH MOORE NOW.

41:04.964 --> 41:05.932
- THANK YOU, LOVE,
THANK YOU.

41:05.965 --> 41:07.434
- BYE.
- BYE.

41:07.467 --> 41:08.802
- YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT NOW.

41:11.204 --> 41:13.139
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING FREDRIK?
- WHAT?

41:13.173 --> 41:14.541
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO MAKE FUN OF ME?

41:14.574 --> 41:17.077
- WHAT?
- WHEN WE MET AT YOUR OFFICE,

41:17.110 --> 41:18.978
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WANTED
TO HELP ME, AND I SAID,

41:19.079 --> 41:20.480
"I WANT NEW DEVELOPMENTS,"
AND YOU SAID,

41:20.513 --> 41:22.082
"NEW DEVELOPMENTS," THE THINGS
THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON.

41:22.082 --> 41:23.316
THAT'S ACTUALLY--I--THIS IS--
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

41:23.350 --> 41:25.251
SKYSCRAPER, 100 STORY--
YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THAT.

41:25.285 --> 41:27.687
LISTEN, OKAY,
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING.

41:27.721 --> 41:29.089
WHEN I STARTED,
25 NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

41:29.089 --> 41:30.523
AGO...
- KNEW THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

41:30.557 --> 41:32.392
- DO YOU KNOW?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD TO DO?

41:32.425 --> 41:34.194
DO YOU THINK IT'S, LIKE, EASY?
WHO'S GONNA HAND THAT OVER?

41:34.227 --> 41:35.328
YOU'RE NOT READY.
- YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

41:35.362 --> 41:36.329
IT'S JUST--
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

41:36.363 --> 41:37.564
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
ZACH VELLA?

41:37.597 --> 41:38.798
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

41:38.832 --> 41:40.233
- IT'S NOT FOR YOU TO GET--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:40.266 --> 41:41.468
IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT WHAT YOU DO,
IT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

41:41.501 --> 41:42.969
I WOULD APPRECIATE THIS
TEN TIMES OVER, BUT I FEEL

41:43.003 --> 41:44.738
THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY
YOUR REAL INTENTION.

41:44.771 --> 41:45.905
I AM STARTING TO FEEL...
- WHAT?

41:45.939 --> 41:47.440
- THAT MAYBE YOU MISS
HAVING CONTROL OVER ME.

41:47.474 --> 41:49.576
FREDRIK LIKES
TO CONTROL SITUATIONS,

41:49.609 --> 41:50.610
AND HE LIKES
TO CONTROL PEOPLE.

41:50.643 --> 41:52.212
I LEARNED THAT FIRSTHAND
LAST YEAR.

41:52.245 --> 41:54.180
- FIRST OF ALL,
I WANT YOU TO WEAR A TIE.

41:54.214 --> 41:55.382
I WOULD, LIKE,
TONE IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

41:55.415 --> 41:56.583
I WOULD STICK TO THE FACTS.

41:56.616 --> 41:59.019
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LOWER,
HELD-BACK ENERGY,

41:59.119 --> 42:00.353
AND BE SMART.

42:00.387 --> 42:02.389
- I'M NOT GOING TO LET THAT
HAPPEN ANYMORE.

42:02.422 --> 42:04.057
- OH, MY GOD, OKAY, OKAY,
YOU'RE--YOU'RE--OKAY,

42:04.057 --> 42:06.059
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I WANTED THIS TO BE.

42:06.059 --> 42:07.827
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU!

42:07.861 --> 42:10.063
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP ME.
YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.

42:10.063 --> 42:11.965
YOU WANT EVERYBODY
TO BE UNDER YOU.

42:12.065 --> 42:13.333
- YOU THINK--
- THAT'S WHAT FIRES YOU UP.

42:13.366 --> 42:14.501
THAT'S WHAT FIRES YOU,
AND NOT BEING ON THE TOP,

42:14.534 --> 42:15.502
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY
ON THE TOP.

42:15.535 --> 42:16.636
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

42:16.670 --> 42:18.071
- YOU WANT TO PUT SOMEBODY ELSE
IN A BAD LIGHT.

42:18.071 --> 42:19.339
- OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

42:19.372 --> 42:20.640
- LISTEN, I DON'T START
IN REAL ESTATE LAST WEEK.

42:20.674 --> 42:21.641
- OKAY, WHATEVER, WHATEVER.
- SHE ACTUALLY THINKS

42:21.675 --> 42:22.642
THAT I STARTED--
- WHATEVER,

42:22.676 --> 42:23.910
YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS.

42:23.943 --> 42:25.412
LOOK AT YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.
LOOK--LOOK--

42:25.445 --> 42:26.413
LOOK YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR.
CHECK YOUR ATTITUDE.

42:26.446 --> 42:27.414
- "LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE MIRROR"?

42:27.447 --> 42:28.581
LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR.
- YEAH,

42:28.615 --> 42:29.749
I WILL, TONIGHT,
AND I'M GONNA SEE SOMEONE

42:29.783 --> 42:31.084
WHO'S TRYING TO HELP
SOMEONE ELSE.

42:31.117 --> 42:33.620
- YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
SOME [bleep] SELFISH BITCH.

42:33.653 --> 42:35.955
- OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD.

42:35.989 --> 42:39.659
- [bleep] YOU.
SCUMBAG.

- NEXT WEEK, ON<i>MILLION</i>
<i>DOLLAR LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

42:42.228 --> 42:46.099
- UM, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS ASKING FOR, WAS IT?

42:46.132 --> 42:48.268
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
HERE I AM, SETTING A RECORD,

42:48.301 --> 42:52.105
AND THIS IS YOUR REACTION?
- UH, YEAH.

42:52.105 --> 42:53.106
- RYAN, SORRY,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

42:53.106 --> 42:54.407
- I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

42:54.441 --> 42:56.476
- AFTER WHAT I JUST
WENT THROUGH WITH FREDRIK,

42:56.509 --> 42:58.478
I DO NOT NEED
MORE NEGATIVE STUFF IN MY LIFE.

42:58.511 --> 43:00.046
- SO YOU WANT TO DO THIS?
- I SWEAR TO GOD,

43:00.080 --> 43:03.216

I'M GOING TO BREAK YOUR FACE.
