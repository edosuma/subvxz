WEBVTT

00:03.700 --> 00:06.633
[voices overlapping]

00:11.267 --> 00:13.333
- JEEZALOO,
LOOK AT GEOFFREY.

00:13.333 --> 00:15.933
HE'S SKIPPING.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.500
- HE'S HAVING FUN, FRANK.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.900
- THEN HE SHOULD TRY
CURTSYING.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.867
THAT'S FUN, TOO.

00:21.867 --> 00:24.100
- HE REMINDS ME OF YOU,
RAYMOND.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.867
- I DIDN'T DO THAT, MOM.

00:25.867 --> 00:28.200
- YES, YOU DID.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.767
- I DID NOT SKIP.

00:29.767 --> 00:32.333
- TO MY LOO.

00:34.933 --> 00:36.667
- THIS IS BORING.

00:36.667 --> 00:40.200
WILL YOU TAKE ME TO THE
PLAYGROUND NOW, UNCLE ROBERT?

00:40.200 --> 00:42.700
ALL RIGHT,
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.933
BUT LISTEN, THERE'S PLENTY
OF MONKEY BARS OUT THERE.

00:44.933 --> 00:49.167
NOT EVERYONE
HAS TO CLIMB ON ME.

00:49.167 --> 00:50.467
- PLEASE?

00:50.467 --> 00:52.367
- ALL RIGHT.

00:56.667 --> 00:59.433
- WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING
SOME CUSHIONS OR SOMETHING?

00:59.433 --> 01:02.167
THIS BENCH
IS KILLING ME.

01:02.167 --> 01:05.700
- IT'S CRUSHING
HIS BRAIN.

01:05.700 --> 01:10.033
- SURE, THESE SEATS
DON'T BOTHER YOU.

01:10.033 --> 01:11.900
- HEY, IF YOU TWO
CAN'T GET ALONG,

01:11.900 --> 01:13.933
I'M GONNA
SEPARATE YOU.

01:13.933 --> 01:15.567
- YOU MEAN LEGALLY?

01:19.200 --> 01:23.833
- ANOTHER SEASON OF
"EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND."

01:23.833 --> 01:26.767
[all grunting]

01:53.167 --> 01:56.233
- OH, GEOFFREY, GEOFFREY,
GEOFFREY!

01:59.767 --> 02:01.533
- YAY, JOEY,
WAY TO GO!

02:01.533 --> 02:03.300
GOOD JOB, JOEY!

02:03.300 --> 02:05.400
- NO, GEOFFREY, WATCH JOEY!

02:05.400 --> 02:06.833
- RAY.

02:06.833 --> 02:08.133
- WELL, LOOK AT HIM.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.033
HE'S STAGGERING AROUND
OUT THERE.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.733
ALL RIGHT, NO MORE BLOODY MARYS
FOR BREAKFAST.

02:19.700 --> 02:22.433
- [indistinct]

02:22.433 --> 02:23.400
- WHAT?

02:23.400 --> 02:24.733
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT DOES HE NEED?

02:24.733 --> 02:27.267
- I THINK HE WANTS TO
USE THE BATHROOM.

02:27.267 --> 02:29.300
- NO, MA, THAT'S JUST
HOW HE RUNS.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.167
- WHAT IS IT, HONEY?

02:36.167 --> 02:38.167
- FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTS.

02:38.167 --> 02:40.200
- WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.700
- GO DOWN THERE.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.433
- NO, THEN THEY'LL KNOW
I'M WITH HIM.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.000
- GO ON.
- FINE.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.133
WHAT?
WHAT, WHAT, GEOFFREY?

02:51.133 --> 02:52.433
WHAT ARE
YOU TRYING TO TELL US?

02:52.433 --> 02:55.200
- DID YOU BRING ANYTHING
FOR ME TO EAT?

02:56.900 --> 02:58.000
- ANYTHING TO EAT?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.133
YOU'RE ASKING ME ABOUT FOOD?

03:00.133 --> 03:01.433
GET THE BALL, OKAY?

03:01.433 --> 03:03.300
PRETEND THE BALL IS FOOD.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.967
GO AHEAD,
GO ON OUT THERE.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.133
GO ON OUT THERE.

03:06.133 --> 03:08.433
THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT FOOD.

03:08.433 --> 03:11.000
YEAH, CHARLIE HUSTLE
WANTS TO KNOW

03:11.000 --> 03:12.533
IF WE BROUGHT ANYTHING
TO EAT.

03:14.367 --> 03:16.667
- WILL YOU MIND IF I LIVE
VICARIOUSLY THROUGH JOEY?

03:19.533 --> 03:21.833
- I SHOULD'VE BROUGHT FOOD.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.200
I MADE CANNELLONI THIS MORNING.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.900
THAT'S GONE.

03:25.900 --> 03:29.033
[cheering]

03:30.733 --> 03:31.800
- WHERE'S ALLY?

03:31.800 --> 03:33.333
- THEY'RE STILL OUT THERE.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.600
ALL THE KIDS
KEPT SPINNING ME

03:34.600 --> 03:37.567
ON THIS
MERRY-GO-ROUND THING.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.633
I KEPT TELLING THEM TO STOP,
BUT THEY WOULDN'T.

03:39.633 --> 03:43.033
THEY JUST KEPT LAUGHING
AND PUSHING ME AND--

03:45.233 --> 03:47.200
I NEED A MINUTE.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.933
- GEOFFREY!

03:54.933 --> 03:56.400
OH, YOUR TEAM
HAS THE BALL.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.700
YOU DON'T GOT
TO PLAY DEFENSE NOW!

04:01.967 --> 04:04.600
- IT'S OKAY, GEOFFREY!
YOU'RE DOING GREAT!

04:04.600 --> 04:06.233
HEY, BIG GEOFF!

04:08.800 --> 04:10.800
- AW, GIVE ME A BREAK.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.567
- WOULD YOU JUST CHEER?

04:12.567 --> 04:14.233
- WHAT?
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

04:14.233 --> 04:16.333
I'M JUST--
I'M FOOLING AROUND.

04:16.333 --> 04:17.800
I'M FOOLING AROUND,
EVERYBODY.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.300
WE'LL STILL LET HIM
SLEEP INSIDE TONIGHT.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.367
- HANG IN THERE, GEOFFREY!

04:23.367 --> 04:25.200
- GOOD HUSTLE,
BIG GEOFF!

04:25.200 --> 04:26.733
- YAY, GEOFFREY!

04:26.733 --> 04:29.600
WAY TO GO, GEOFFREY!

04:39.033 --> 04:40.433
- OH, WHEN WE GET HOME,

04:40.433 --> 04:42.767
I'LL GET YOU SOMETHING
FOR YOUR TUM-TUM.

04:42.767 --> 04:45.333
- NO, THAT'S OKAY, MA.

04:45.333 --> 04:46.333
I'M FINE NOW.

04:46.333 --> 04:47.733
STOP RUBBING MY TUMMY!

04:50.067 --> 04:51.500
- HEY, REMEMBER THE TIME

04:51.500 --> 04:55.133
YOU HAD THAT CLAM ROLL
AT HOWARD JOHNSON'S?

04:55.133 --> 04:57.400
- ALL RIGHT, DAD.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.800
- AND YOU WASHED IT DOWN
WITH A STRAWBERRY MILK SHAKE?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.600
- YEAH, I REMEMBER, DAD.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.333
PLEASE STOP.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.733
- I HAD A SARDINE SANDWICH

05:06.733 --> 05:10.767
WITH ONIONS AND MAYONNAISE,

05:10.767 --> 05:15.733
AND IT WAS WARM, I RECALL.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.233
- WHY DO THIS?

05:17.233 --> 05:20.667
- I FIND YOUR DISCOMFORT
AMUSING.

05:22.733 --> 05:24.400
- ALL RIGHT,
PLENTY OF SNACKS LEFT OVER.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.600
WHO WANTS SOME CHEESE STICKS
AND GUAVA NECTAR?

05:30.300 --> 05:33.000
- I'LL BE OUTSIDE.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.067
- EXCUSE ME, RAYMOND?

05:35.067 --> 05:36.700
- HEY, COACH BRYAN.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.967
- HELLO.

05:37.967 --> 05:39.367
CAN WE TALK
FOR JUST A MOMENT?

05:39.367 --> 05:42.067
- YEAH, YEAH, WHAT?

05:42.067 --> 05:43.633
WHAT, IS THIS
ABOUT GEOFFREY SKIPPING,

05:43.633 --> 05:44.900
'CAUSE WE'RE
GONNA WORK ON THAT.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.100
OH, NO, NO.
NOT AT ALL.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.533
HE'S MORE THAN WELCOME
TO SKIP.

05:47.533 --> 05:50.100
- WELL, THEN,
HE'S YOUR MAN.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.200
- LET'S SIT FOR A SECOND,
SHALL WE?

05:53.200 --> 05:56.167
- ALL RIGHT.

05:56.167 --> 05:58.367
- YOU KNOW, RAYMOND,

05:58.367 --> 06:00.233
I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING
SOME OF THE THINGS

06:00.233 --> 06:01.933
THAT YOU WERE SAYING
IN THE STANDS TODAY,

06:01.933 --> 06:03.233
AND IT CONCERNED ME--

06:03.233 --> 06:04.467
- YEAH, LISTEN,
LISTEN, I--

06:04.467 --> 06:06.467
- EXCUSE ME,
I WAS STILL SPEAKING.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.400
I'M CONCERNED
THAT MAYBE WE'RE DEALING WITH

06:11.400 --> 06:13.733
SOME MISPLACED
PRIORITIES HERE.

06:13.733 --> 06:16.300
NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
A PROMINENT SPORTS WRITER

06:16.300 --> 06:18.233
AND YOU DEAL
WITH GROWN-UP TEAMS

06:18.233 --> 06:20.833
THAT ARE VERY CONCERNED
WITH WINNING AND LOSING--

06:20.833 --> 06:21.833
- LOOK, I KNOW WHAT--

06:21.833 --> 06:23.400
- EXCUSE ME, STILL SPEAKING.

06:25.333 --> 06:27.433
- BUT I THINK
WE ALL NEED TO UNDERSTAND

06:27.433 --> 06:30.367
THAT THE SPACE
OUTSIDE THE HOOP

06:30.367 --> 06:34.400
IS JUST AS VALID AS THE SPACE
INSIDE THE HOOP.

06:38.533 --> 06:40.367
- HMM.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.867
YOU DON'T OFTEN HEAR THAT
FROM A BASKETBALL COACH.

06:43.867 --> 06:45.367
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

06:45.367 --> 06:47.900
COMPETITION ISN'T REALLY
WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.600
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.767
IT'S ABOUT FUN.

06:51.767 --> 06:55.133
I MEAN, FUN!

06:55.133 --> 06:56.167
JUST GIVE ME A BREAK.

06:56.167 --> 06:57.433
IT'S 8:00 IN THE MORNING.

06:57.433 --> 07:00.067
- RAYMOND,
ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY

07:00.067 --> 07:01.600
IS THAT,
WHEN YOU KID AROUND,

07:01.600 --> 07:03.367
IT SEEMS THAT YOU'RE
GENUINELY CONCERNED

07:03.367 --> 07:05.267
THAT GEOFFREY'S
DOING SOMETHING BAD.

07:05.267 --> 07:06.300
- WELL, NO, NO, NO, NO.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.633
THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL.

07:07.633 --> 07:10.100
- WELL, THEN,
WHY MAKE FUN OF YOUR SON?

07:10.100 --> 07:12.000
- I WASN'T MAKING FUN.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.267
I WAS MAKING FUN-NY!

07:16.267 --> 07:19.233
- "HE'S ALLERGIC
TO THE BASKETBALL"?

07:19.233 --> 07:20.233
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

07:20.233 --> 07:23.367
- [chuckling]

07:27.767 --> 07:29.733
IT IS A LITTLE FUNNY.

07:29.733 --> 07:31.867
- YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,

07:31.867 --> 07:34.400
OFTEN A PARENT BELITTLES
A CHILD FROM THE SIDELINE

07:34.400 --> 07:38.000
BECAUSE THAT PARENT HIMSELF
IS A FRUSTRATED ATHLETE.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.133
- NO, NO, NO WAY.

07:39.133 --> 07:40.300
I WAS GOOD AT SPORTS.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.900
NOT THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.400
- LOOK, LOOK,

07:44.400 --> 07:46.133
YOU'RE WORRIED THAT
I'M TOO SERIOUS HERE,

07:46.133 --> 07:47.867
BUT IT'S JUST
THE OPPOSITE.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.533
I'VE ACCEPTED
I'VE GOT ONE KID OUT THERE

07:49.533 --> 07:51.200
WHO'S GOOD AT BASKETBALL,

07:51.200 --> 07:52.733
AND ONE KID WHO CAN'T
DO ANYTHING OUT THERE

07:52.733 --> 07:55.333
EXCEPT SPIN AROUND
AND PRETEND HE'S SCOOBY-DOO.

08:03.467 --> 08:05.267
[imitating Scooby-Doo]
HERRO, REOFFREY!

08:13.400 --> 08:14.700
RO RONG!

08:28.333 --> 08:30.200
- HEY, THE NEXT TIME
ROBERT SAYS HE'S NAUSEOUS,

08:30.200 --> 08:33.133
HE'S WALKING HOME,
ALL RIGHT?

08:33.133 --> 08:37.800
I HAD TO HOSE OFF
THE WHOLE SIDE OF THE VAN.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.267
AS FAR AS THE STREET GOES,

08:39.267 --> 08:43.133
I THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PRAY FOR RAIN.

08:43.133 --> 08:45.900
- GEOFFREY QUIT BASKETBALL.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.733
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHEN?

08:47.733 --> 08:49.167
- JUST NOW.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.933
THEY'RE UP THERE
CHANGING OUT OF THEIR UNIFORMS.

08:50.933 --> 08:53.467
HE HANDS ME HIS AND SAYS HE
DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.100
- OH.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.533
WONDER WHY THAT IS?

09:00.867 --> 09:03.333
- GEE, I DON'T KNOW.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.700
BUT I WAS
JUST TALKING TO HIM,

09:05.700 --> 09:08.133
AND I WAS THINKING
IT COULD POSSIBLY BE RELATED

09:08.133 --> 09:09.900
TO YOU TELLING HIS COACH

09:09.900 --> 09:13.133
THAT HE LOOKED
LIKE SCOOBY-DOO.

09:13.133 --> 09:14.767
- I NEVER SAID THAT.

09:14.767 --> 09:16.267
- THEN WHAT DID YOU SAY?

09:16.267 --> 09:17.467
- I DON'T KNOW,

09:17.467 --> 09:20.633
BUT I DID NOT SAY
THAT EXACTLY.

09:20.633 --> 09:22.433
- WHAT DID YOU SAY, RAY?

09:24.100 --> 09:27.000
- I WAS HAVING
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION

09:27.000 --> 09:28.367
WITH BRYAN TRENBERTH,

09:28.367 --> 09:30.800
WHO, BY THE WAY,
KNOWS SQUAT ABOUT BASKETBALL,

09:30.800 --> 09:32.267
AND--AND--

09:32.267 --> 09:34.600
THE EXACT THING I SAID
WAS THAT GEOFFREY WAS GOOD

09:34.600 --> 09:37.233
AT SPINNING AROUND
AND PRETENDING TO BE SCOOBY-DOO.

09:38.167 --> 09:42.633
GOOD AT SPINNING
AND PRETENDING.

09:47.133 --> 09:48.833
- AND GEOFF HEARD YOU.

09:48.833 --> 09:50.200
- SO, LOOK, I KNOW--

09:50.200 --> 09:51.933
- AND YOU WERE MAKING
YOUR STUPID COMMENTS

09:51.933 --> 09:53.067
THROUGH THE WHOLE GAME,

09:53.067 --> 09:54.500
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
HEARD YOU.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.700
- OKAY, BUT THE ONLY THING
HE HEARD WAS SCOOBY-DOO.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.367
NOBODY QUITS FROM THAT.

09:59.467 --> 10:01.400
YOU THINK
THAT HE QUIT FROM THAT?

10:02.267 --> 10:03.667
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.067
- WAIT A MINUTE.

10:05.067 --> 10:06.400
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA SAY TO HIM?

10:06.400 --> 10:07.933
- I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM.
DON'T WORRY.

10:07.933 --> 10:09.133
- DON'T WORRY?

10:09.133 --> 10:10.467
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

10:10.467 --> 10:11.933
- I DON'T HAVE
TO RUN THINGS BY YOU.

10:11.933 --> 10:14.500
YOU'RE NOT IN CHARGE HERE.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.767
- RAY.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.467
- I'M GONNA SAY...

10:20.167 --> 10:23.633
THAT IT WAS A JOKE,
AND I WAS JUST KIDDING,

10:23.633 --> 10:25.833
AND HE SHOULD PLAY BASKETBALL
BECAUSE IT'S A BLAST,

10:25.833 --> 10:27.567
AND LET'S ALL
HAVE SOME BUBBLE GUM.

10:28.733 --> 10:31.100
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
APOLOGIZE?

10:31.100 --> 10:35.133
- SEE, THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING.

10:35.133 --> 10:36.833
IF I GO UP THERE
AND APOLOGIZE TO GEOFFREY,

10:36.833 --> 10:39.567
THEN HE THINKS I HAVE
SOMETHING TO APOLOGIZE ABOUT,

10:39.567 --> 10:41.900
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT'S A BIG DEAL

10:41.900 --> 10:43.033
WHEN IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.700
- IT IS A BIG DEAL!

10:44.700 --> 10:46.067
- NO, NO!

10:46.067 --> 10:48.167
NO, IT'S NOT!

10:48.167 --> 10:49.633
HEY, WEREN'T YOU THE ONE
WHO CAME UP WITH

10:49.633 --> 10:51.733
THE "LAUGH WHEN THEY FALL DOWN"
TRICK

10:51.733 --> 10:53.600
SO THEY WON'T KNOW
THEY HURT THEMSELVES?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.200
- WELL, HE DIDN'T
FALL DOWN TODAY.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.600
IT'S AS IF
YOU PUSHED HIM DOWN.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.600
- THAT IS A COMPLETELY
WRONG ANALOGY!

11:03.767 --> 11:05.333
IF ANYTHING,

11:05.333 --> 11:08.233
TODAY IT WAS LIKE
I PATTED HIM ON THE BACK,

11:08.233 --> 11:09.467
AND HE TRIPPED.

11:09.467 --> 11:11.100
- RAY.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.567
YOU'RE NOT GOING
NEAR MY SON.

11:12.567 --> 11:13.900
- COME ON!

11:13.900 --> 11:15.300
THIS IS NOTHING!

11:15.300 --> 11:17.167
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT MY FATHER

11:17.167 --> 11:19.100
USED TO DO TO ME
WHEN I WAS A KID?

11:19.100 --> 11:20.500
I REMEMBER ONE TIME,

11:20.500 --> 11:22.300
I WAS GETTING READY
FOR THE SENIOR PROM,

11:22.300 --> 11:25.133
AND I WAS COMBING MY HAIR
IN THE HALLWAY MIRROR,

11:25.133 --> 11:26.867
AND HE PUSHES PAST ME
AND GOES,

11:26.867 --> 11:29.433
"BAD HAIRCUT:
I CAN STILL SEE YOUR FACE."

11:31.667 --> 11:33.767
- AND HOW DID THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

11:35.767 --> 11:39.033
- WHAT?
NOTHING.

11:39.033 --> 11:42.033
I KNEW THAT HE WAS
JUST TRYING TO BE FUNNY.

11:43.167 --> 11:44.900
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

11:44.900 --> 11:48.167
I FELT BAD FOR A SECOND,
BUT THEN I FORGOT ABOUT IT.

11:48.167 --> 11:50.567
- UNTIL NOW?

11:52.300 --> 11:54.167
- LISTEN,
THIS WASN'T LIKE THAT.

11:54.167 --> 11:56.933
ALL I REALLY DID
WAS SAY A LITTLE JOKE.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.400
- LIKE YOUR DAD.

12:00.300 --> 12:04.367
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE TOLD ME
THAT HAIRCUT STORY BEFORE.

12:07.167 --> 12:09.167
- IT WAS JUST A LITTLE JOKE.

12:13.667 --> 12:14.967
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.700
- I KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.133
- I'LL TALK TO HIM.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.133
I'M GONNA NEED
LOTS OF GUM.

12:25.733 --> 12:26.833
HEY, GEOFFREY.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.800
- HI, DADDY.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.667
- HEY.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.700
LISTEN, GEOFF.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.700
WHOOP.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.067
WHAT YOU DOING THERE?

12:35.067 --> 12:37.267
- MAGNET MAN,
HE STICKS TO THINGS.

12:37.267 --> 12:40.533
- THAT IS SO GREAT.

12:40.533 --> 12:42.700
LISTEN, GEOFF,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

12:42.700 --> 12:43.933
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU

12:43.933 --> 12:46.333
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT BASKETBALL TODAY, OKAY?

12:46.333 --> 12:47.333
HERE, LET ME SEE.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.800
LET ME SEE MAGNET MAN.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.067
OKAY, LET'S GO.

12:50.067 --> 12:51.400
HEY, HEY!
WHERE WE GOING?

12:51.400 --> 12:53.100
WHOA!

12:53.100 --> 12:55.733
WHOA!

12:55.733 --> 12:56.833
OH, YEAH.

12:56.833 --> 13:00.100
OKAY, LISTEN.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.100
GEOFF, GEOFF, GEOFF.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.100
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.300
UM...

13:06.100 --> 13:07.767
SO, GEOFFREY,

13:07.767 --> 13:08.967
I HEARD THAT YOU WERE

13:08.967 --> 13:10.667
THINKING ABOUT QUITTING
BASKETBALL.

13:10.667 --> 13:11.933
- YES.

13:11.933 --> 13:13.600
- WHY?

13:13.600 --> 13:14.800
- I'M NO GOOD.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.767
- WHO SAID THAT?

13:16.767 --> 13:17.833
YOU'RE TERRIFIC!

13:17.833 --> 13:18.867
NOBODY SAID YOU'RE NO GOOD.

13:18.867 --> 13:19.867
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

13:19.867 --> 13:20.867
- MICHAEL'S GOOD.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.133
YOU SAID SO.

13:22.133 --> 13:24.433
- OH.

13:24.433 --> 13:25.367
SEE, NO.

13:25.367 --> 13:28.367
MICHAEL'S GOOD,
AND SO ARE YOU.

13:28.367 --> 13:29.600
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.933
I WAS TALKING
TO COACH BRYAN TODAY

13:31.933 --> 13:33.367
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE,

13:33.367 --> 13:36.700
AND YOU HEARD ME
SAY A LITTLE JOKE.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.467
DADDY DOES THAT SOMETIMES,
BUT I WAS JUST KIDDING,

13:39.467 --> 13:41.533
LIKE WHEN YOU CALL ME
"POOPY-HEAD."

13:41.533 --> 13:44.433
I KNOW YOU REALLY DON'T
THINK I'M A POOPY-HEAD.

13:48.167 --> 13:51.300
OKAY, MAYBE A BAD EXAMPLE.

13:53.067 --> 13:54.667
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING:

13:54.667 --> 13:57.333
I WAS WRONG
TO SAY THAT JOKE TODAY,

13:57.333 --> 13:58.967
AND I'M SORRY.

13:58.967 --> 13:59.967
OKAY?

13:59.967 --> 14:01.900
- OKAY.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.167
- GOOD, GOOD, I'M GLAD.

14:04.167 --> 14:06.033
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE MY BOY, RIGHT?

14:07.067 --> 14:08.400
- YEAH.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.633
- OKAY, THEN.

14:12.633 --> 14:14.067
AND I WANT YOU
TO PLAY BASKETBALL,

14:14.067 --> 14:15.633
BECAUSE YOU
REALLY ARE VERY GOOD.

14:15.633 --> 14:17.633
- NO, I'M NOT.
- YES, YOU ARE!

14:17.633 --> 14:20.333
I TOLD YOU I WAS JUST KIDDING
ABOUT SCOOBY-DOO AND ALL THAT,

14:20.333 --> 14:22.233
SO YOU CAN
PLAY BASKETBALL NOW.

14:22.233 --> 14:24.067
- BUT I DON'T WANT TO.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.067
- YES, YOU DO.

14:25.067 --> 14:26.200
IT'S FUN.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.133
- BUT I'M THE WORST.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.500
- YOU'RE NOT THE WORST.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.133
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
THAT TALK ANYMORE.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.633
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO
IS KEEP TRYING.

14:32.633 --> 14:35.267
HEY, REMEMBER THE STORY
OF THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE,

14:35.267 --> 14:37.033
AND THE TORTOISE WAS
WAY BEHIND IN THE RACE,

14:37.033 --> 14:38.333
BUT HE KEPT SAYING,

14:38.333 --> 14:41.133
"I THINK I CAN,
I THINK I CAN!"

14:42.700 --> 14:46.133
- A TRAIN SAID THAT.

14:47.367 --> 14:50.167
- OKAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO SAID IT.

14:50.167 --> 14:54.700
WHAT MATTERS IS,
THAT IS A TRUE STORY,

14:54.700 --> 14:56.567
AND ALL YOU GOT TO DO

14:56.567 --> 14:59.367
IS KEEP THINKING YOU CAN
AND KEEP PLAYING,

14:59.367 --> 15:01.100
AND YOU WILL WIN THAT RACE.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.400
- DO I HAVE TO?

15:02.400 --> 15:03.400
- YES!

15:03.400 --> 15:05.067
NO, NO.

15:05.067 --> 15:06.800
NO, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.367
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK
THAT I'M MAKING YOU.

15:11.633 --> 15:13.667
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MISS OUT ON THE FUN.

15:13.667 --> 15:16.067
THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT PART, THE FUN.

15:16.067 --> 15:18.633
- EH, NO, THANKS.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.400
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE

15:25.400 --> 15:28.133
BASKETBALL PLAYERS
GET ALL THE TIME?

15:28.133 --> 15:30.733
LOTS AND LOTS OF GUM.

15:40.933 --> 15:42.167
[whistle blows]

15:42.167 --> 15:43.767
- WOULD ANYBODY LIKE
DEVILLED EGGS?

15:43.767 --> 15:45.400
- YEAH, I'LL TAKE
A COUPLE MORE, MA.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.467
- HEY, YOU'RE WALKING HOME.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.567
- YOU KNOW, HONEY,

15:55.567 --> 15:58.233
IF ANYTHING,
PULL MOMMY'S FACE UP.

16:02.867 --> 16:03.867
- DADDY?

16:03.867 --> 16:05.533
- YEAH, WHAT, BUDDY?

16:05.533 --> 16:06.867
- I'M BORED.

16:06.867 --> 16:09.200
- WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GO TO THE PLAYGROUND.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.000
- BUT I WANT TO PLAY.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.533
- WHAT, IN THE GAME?

16:15.833 --> 16:17.000
OH, YEAH,
ABSOLUTELY.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
COME ON!

16:18.000 --> 16:19.200
[buzzer sounds]

16:19.200 --> 16:20.200
- HALFTIME!

16:20.200 --> 16:21.967
- ALL RIGHT, GREAT!

16:21.967 --> 16:23.167
THAT WAS GREAT!

16:23.167 --> 16:24.167
EVERYBODY WAS GOOD.

16:24.167 --> 16:25.433
SUPER-DUPER JOB, EVERYBODY.

16:25.433 --> 16:27.533
LET'S REHYDRATE
AND COME RIGHT BACK.

16:27.533 --> 16:29.200
- COACH BRYAN,

16:29.200 --> 16:31.167
GEOFFREY HAS SOMETHING
HE WANTS TO ASK YOU.

16:31.167 --> 16:34.267
- SURE, WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU, MY FRIEND?

16:34.267 --> 16:36.167
- CAN I PLAY?

16:36.167 --> 16:37.533
- WELL, GEOFFREY, BEFORE,

16:37.533 --> 16:39.167
YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T FEEL LIKE PLAYING,

16:39.167 --> 16:41.400
BUT NOW
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND

16:41.400 --> 16:42.733
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY?

16:42.733 --> 16:44.000
- YOU HEARD HIM.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.100
COACH. BRYAN.
COACH BRYAN.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.333
- WELL, GEOFFREY,
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY,

16:50.333 --> 16:52.967
I'LL PUT YOU RIGHT IN.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.300
YOU CAN BE NUMBER 7,

16:54.300 --> 16:55.600
IF YOU'RE READY
TO HAVE FUN.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.033
- HE'S READY!

16:57.033 --> 16:58.400
OKAY, I'LL GO SIT.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.700
HEY, NUMBER 7,
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WAS NUMBER 7?

17:00.700 --> 17:01.600
MICKEY MANTLE.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.000
- I BELIEVE THAT'S BASEBALL.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.133
- I KNOW, BRYAN.

17:08.133 --> 17:10.300
BUT HE WAS STILL GREAT,

17:10.300 --> 17:12.167
AND IT WAS
A SPORT, TOO.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.433
AND HE HAD FUN,

17:13.433 --> 17:15.300
AND THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.333
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.000
NEXT TIME PICK IT UP

17:31.000 --> 17:32.600
IF YOU WANT TO.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.033
LOOKING GOOD OUT THERE!

17:38.500 --> 17:39.667
[whistle blows]

17:39.667 --> 17:42.033
- ALL RIGHT,
WAY TO PLAY TOUGH "D"!

17:45.033 --> 17:46.500
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.233
- WHAT? I'M TRYING
TO KEEP IT ALIVE UP HERE.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.667
[singing] HERE WE GO, GEOFFREY,
HERE WE GO

17:54.200 --> 17:56.067
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:56.067 --> 17:58.867
- DIFFERENT FAMILY.

17:58.867 --> 18:01.300
HELLO.

18:05.633 --> 18:06.633
[whistle blows]

18:06.633 --> 18:07.667
- TRAVELING.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.067
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
GEOFFREY.

18:09.067 --> 18:10.233
DRIBBLING
ISN'T EVERYTHING.

18:10.233 --> 18:11.533
WAY TO GET THE BALL!

18:11.533 --> 18:12.733
YOU GOT THE BALL!
WAY TO GET THE BALL!

18:19.467 --> 18:22.733
WAY TO HAVE FUN OUT THERE!

18:22.733 --> 18:24.367
GO, FUN!

18:42.167 --> 18:44.767
HEY, THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN.

18:44.767 --> 18:48.667
[laughs]

18:48.667 --> 18:50.267
- CALM DOWN.

18:50.267 --> 18:51.633
- HEY, I'M HERE FOR HIM.

18:51.633 --> 18:54.233
- MAYBE YOU'RE A LITTLE
TOO HERE FOR HIM.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.233
- DO YOU WANT TO HELP OUT?

18:55.233 --> 18:56.633
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE CHATTER?

18:59.667 --> 19:00.867
[whistle blows]

19:00.867 --> 19:03.200
- HEY, FOUL!
HE WAS FOULED!

19:03.200 --> 19:04.800
- TWO SHOTS!

19:04.800 --> 19:07.233
- OH, HE GETS TWO SHOTS.

19:10.467 --> 19:12.933
ALL RIGHT, GEOFFREY,
DON'T WORRY.

19:12.933 --> 19:15.000
WHATEVER YOU DO IN LIFE
IS GREAT.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.200
- HOLD IT, BUDDY.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.200
BEHIND THE LINE.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.200
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.400
IT'S A COMMON MISTAKE.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.767
WE'VE ALL DONE THAT,
RIGHT?

19:28.767 --> 19:30.667
- WOULD YOU SIT DOWN?

19:40.233 --> 19:43.367
[cheers and applause]

19:46.867 --> 19:48.133
OH, DID YOU SEE THAT?

19:48.133 --> 19:49.600
OH, MAN, THAT WAS GREAT!

19:49.600 --> 19:50.600
THAT WAS--

19:50.600 --> 19:52.100
- OW!

19:52.100 --> 19:53.100
HE BIT ME!

19:53.100 --> 19:54.633
- GEOFFREY, GEOFFREY!

19:54.633 --> 19:56.100
GEOFFREY, GEOFFREY!

19:58.200 --> 20:00.467
OH, YEAH, OKAY.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.433
I KNOW, I KNOW.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.267
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER SHOT.
YEAH.

20:03.267 --> 20:05.067
THIS ONE DOESN'T MATTER,
EITHER, GEOFFREY.

20:05.067 --> 20:06.433
WHATEVER YOU WANT!

20:15.133 --> 20:18.267
[screaming]

20:19.867 --> 20:21.200
GEOFFREY!

20:21.200 --> 20:23.633
DID YOU SEE MY BOY?
DID YOU SEE MY BOY?

20:23.633 --> 20:24.900
DID YOU SEE MY BOY?

20:24.900 --> 20:26.133
DID YOU ALL SEE MY BOY?

20:26.133 --> 20:27.733
AAH, OHH, OW!

20:27.733 --> 20:28.800
I'M ALL RIGHT.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.100
I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY!

20:30.100 --> 20:31.700
WAY TO GO, GEOFFREY!

20:31.700 --> 20:33.000
YEAH, YOU, TOO, MICHAEL!

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
I DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I HAVE TWO SONS!

20:35.000 --> 20:37.433
YEAH, AND A DAUGHTER!

20:37.433 --> 20:39.900
YAY, YAY, YAY, EVERYBODY!

20:39.900 --> 20:41.533
MOVE OVER, MOVE OVER.

20:41.533 --> 20:42.700
OW, OW.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.033
OW, OW, OW.

20:45.033 --> 20:47.333
- IS THAT YOUR DAD?

20:55.967 --> 20:58.800
- OKAY, KIDS, GREAT FUN TODAY.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.333
I'M PROUD OF BOTH OF YOU.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.767
AND LISTEN, GEOFFREY,
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED

21:01.767 --> 21:03.700
IF YOU MISSED THOSE SHOTS,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

21:03.700 --> 21:04.700
YOU MADE THEM BOTH.

21:04.700 --> 21:05.700
I LOVE YOU.

21:05.700 --> 21:06.567
I LOVE YOU BOTH, GUYS.

21:06.567 --> 21:07.900
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

21:07.900 --> 21:08.933
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

21:08.933 --> 21:10.400
- GOOD NIGHT.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.533
