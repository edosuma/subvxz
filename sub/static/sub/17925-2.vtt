No, Sergeant. I know why you might
hope to batter the man.

I made sure he sat for breakfast
at the same time each morning.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.477
This boy must do likewise.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.750
He cannot learn punctuality otherwise,

06:56.880 --> 07:00.714
and if he does not learn punctuality,
he cannot learn discipline.

as if he might in fact be a folk hero.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.557
that is the story you ought to tell.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.320
Do you threaten me, Mr Dove?

16:01.920 --> 16:04.275
Well, you interpret it
how you wish, Miss Castello.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.791
But you see it done.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.038
(DOG BARKS)

16:21.640 --> 16:24.359
See how they love to play, Connor?

16:24.480 --> 16:26.118
(LAUGHS)

16:26.240 --> 16:28.117
(DOG BARKS)

16:33.040 --> 16:35.759
I fear only that the boy
will become spoiled, sir.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.756
There is nothing spoiling in joy,
Miss Chudleigh.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.156
All young boys need a dog.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.917
Do you know, Connor, when I was
only a little older than you are now,

16:48.040 --> 16:50.554
I lost my mother and was alone.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.591
But then I was found and cared for

16:52.720 --> 16:54.870
by a man who showed me
that a way may be made

16:55.000 --> 16:57.355
from the lonely boy I was

16:57.480 --> 17:00.199
to a new life - a better life.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.558
Connor, I intend to be that man for you.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.876
You have my oath on it.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.752
Until you yourself are become a man,

17:11.880 --> 17:13.154
it will be my greatest endeavour

17:13.280 --> 17:15.839
to see you do not lack for a single thing.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.673
I will be a father to you.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.998
You choose your favourite, Connor,
then we shall bring it home.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.479
I thought to settle your invoice
in cash, Mr Sparks.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.034
We are grateful, Mr Dove.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.197
As am I for your efforts.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.833
The beasts were not too hard to find?

17:40.960 --> 17:43.474
Sir. This is Jamrach's.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.718
There is not a creature alive that
we here cannot locate for you.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.433
And the other conditions we agreed?

17:48.560 --> 17:51.200
Full anonymity, sir, as promised.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.799
Thatcher.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.036
Inspector. My apologies, sir.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.549
A snitch reports, sir, and I thought
his intelligence worth a coin.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.875
That being?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.435
Captain Jackson. He and Miss Hart.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.949
I mean, it's not as if
she was the sole focus

18:19.080 --> 18:20.229
of his ardour down the years.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.920
If we roust each and every
twat that man has inspected,

18:23.040 --> 18:24.713
the pair of us will be old and grey.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.832
Yes, sir. I know, sir.
But there was one other

18:27.960 --> 18:29.758
who, word had it, he stayed loyal to.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.998
Only for a little while, but the talk
was that she kept him in order.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.111
Look, the pair of them were tight
till Miss Susan got locked down

18:35.240 --> 18:36.150
and then he made his choice.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.396
You have paid a snitch
for old gossip, Thatcher?

18:38.520 --> 18:40.113
No, sir, I paid him
because he brought word

18:40.240 --> 18:42.516
that this other is
once more in Whitechapel.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.839
Who this lady?

18:45.960 --> 18:49.919
Well-to-do. Fine silk, fine hair,
fine carriage, you know.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.554
- Slum tourist?
- Yeah, of a kind.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.000
What kind?

18:54.120 --> 18:56.191
The dramatic, sir. Playhouses.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.396
Your games are ended, then?

19:07.520 --> 19:09.318
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

19:10.640 --> 19:12.039
Are you expecting visitors, Mimi?

19:12.160 --> 19:16.313
THATCHER: Oi, Police!
You will open these doors!

19:16.440 --> 19:17.635
In there!

19:19.480 --> 19:21.630
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Open!

19:21.760 --> 19:22.955
Open up, I say!

19:25.680 --> 19:26.590
Police!

19:27.840 --> 19:30.832
- Open this door!
- Quick, up into the lighting rigs.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.115
- Miss Morton?
- Yes.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.550
We've come for a show, lady.

19:39.680 --> 19:43.230
One man here, other stage door.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.957
Watch your step.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.116
- There are lights?
- There are.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.435
(SWITCHES CLICK)

20:00.120 --> 20:02.475
- Look at that, a theatre.
- Hm.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.389
So, it is the case that you and
Captain Jackson once stepped out?

20:06.520 --> 20:08.113
Stepped out?

20:08.240 --> 20:11.437
Hm, that's a delicate phrase
for a man in a velvet collar.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.393
SHINE: Well, we know you theatricals,
how you like to use words

20:14.520 --> 20:16.989
to describe a thing that ain't
actually the thing itself.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.633
Oh, you mean a simile?

20:18.760 --> 20:21.593
Although "stepped out"
is perhaps more of a metaphor.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.838
Perhaps you'd best describe
the thing itself?

20:24.960 --> 20:28.237
All right, then, let me ask you this.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.078
- Were you...
- Mm-hm?

20:30.200 --> 20:33.477
...and the man most widely
known as Homer Jackson

20:33.600 --> 20:35.273
once joined by cock and cunny?

20:35.400 --> 20:38.199
Oh. Oh, so much clearer.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.596
Language is so much better for
an accurate expression, I find.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.836
THATCHER: Well, then, miss. Were you?

20:42.960 --> 20:44.189
Yes.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.550
My God, that is a loathsome hat.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.755
When did contact cease?

20:50.880 --> 20:53.838
When he chose to join that cock
to his wife's cunny instead.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.434
SHINE: You got friends visiting,
Miss Morton?

21:00.560 --> 21:04.315
Do you see us ready
to admit audiences yet?

21:04.440 --> 21:05.635
No?

21:05.760 --> 21:08.639
That is because there is
a renovation taking place

21:08.760 --> 21:10.239
and because I have yet
to establish for myself

21:10.360 --> 21:12.510
how best a collapsing wall
may be buttressed

21:12.640 --> 21:14.790
and my plastering is not
all I'd wish it to be.

21:14.920 --> 21:15.910
I must employ workmen,

21:16.040 --> 21:19.317
and workmen, not unlike policemen,
are fond of tea and biscuits.

21:20.360 --> 21:24.991
It's not the only items
we police have a liking for.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.670
(SLAP)

21:32.800 --> 21:34.916
(WHISPERS) Wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.478
You know, Miss Morton,

21:38.600 --> 21:40.955
you grow ever more fetching to my eye.

21:44.360 --> 21:48.194
Now, it is in your interest
to be candid with me, lady.

21:48.320 --> 21:52.359
The risk of a fire in a place
so full of the flammable.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.836
My theatre burns, that fire will
not stop till it meets the river.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.032
Well, best you tell me, then.
Have you seen him?

22:01.160 --> 22:02.480
Have you hid him?

22:05.680 --> 22:08.991
I'll tell you something
about Captain Homer Jackson.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.475
I'm sure a great many believe
he cuts quite the dash

22:11.600 --> 22:12.510
with his cool eye

22:12.640 --> 22:15.951
for all that the world, in its
foolishness, considers of value.

22:16.080 --> 22:19.835
And I'll admit, such a cynicism
quite had me taken for a while.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.874
(LIGHTER CLICKS)

22:27.000 --> 22:30.755
But that nonchalance is just a pose

22:30.880 --> 22:35.670
behind which he hides a tearful,
fearful, treacherous heart.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.438
Further to which,

22:37.560 --> 22:42.270
for a man to spend so much of his life
in the service of his manhood,

22:42.400 --> 22:44.835
when that manhood is,

22:44.960 --> 22:47.076
well,

22:47.200 --> 22:49.476
more of a boyhood.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.910
You get my meaning, Mr Shine.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.320
Thatcher.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.710
With me, Thatcher.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.672
Run along.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.198
(SIGHS)

23:36.600 --> 23:39.672
Miss Morton, any damage incurred
while you keep us here,

23:39.800 --> 23:41.154
I will foot the bill myself.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.398
And what will you do, Miss Hart?
Set armed men to rob another train?

23:44.520 --> 23:47.239
Now, let us hope it doesn't
come to that, all right?

23:47.360 --> 23:48.270
Are you OK, Mimi?

23:48.400 --> 23:50.516
I will not have you soft-soap me, either.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.996
Perhaps, after all, we have
overstayed our welcome.

23:54.120 --> 23:57.715
Jedediah Shine is not a man I would
have set any further sights on you.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.230
Come. It's becoming dark. We may go.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.873
Find ourselves alternative concealment.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.435
(LAUGHS) And then, when you're caught

24:05.560 --> 24:07.756
and your severed heads are
displayed on the iron railings

24:07.880 --> 24:10.554
that line the new station house
on Leman Street,

24:10.680 --> 24:11.875
I shall have eternal guilt

24:12.000 --> 24:14.276
to add to the catalogue of vexations
I suffer

24:14.400 --> 24:16.550
as a result of you coming back
into my life.

24:16.680 --> 24:17.954
No.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.390
This profanity is part of some strategy

24:20.520 --> 24:22.352
that, as its end, sees you restored,

24:22.480 --> 24:24.994
these two gone away, and that man
Dove punished for all he has done?

24:26.360 --> 24:30.752
It is no easy task, Miss Morton,
but, yes, that is the goal.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.551
Best you and your merry band
get about it, then, Mr Reid.

24:55.120 --> 24:58.272
Where you go, you trust these people?

24:58.400 --> 25:01.518
They are not one-time lovers of mine
but, that aside, yes, I do.

25:01.640 --> 25:02.914
What am I today?
The world's chopping block?

25:03.040 --> 25:05.509
I want to know you're safe, is all.

25:05.640 --> 25:09.235
Just get about your work, Husband,
and I shall get about mine.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.276
(WHISPERS) Leonard. Myrtle.

25:24.320 --> 25:28.200
Miss Susan. Quick, before you're seen.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.516
Look at you, Myrtle.
You must be near term.

25:33.640 --> 25:37.270
I am, Miss Susan. And you?
Is all safe with you?

25:37.400 --> 25:40.074
Oh, you must not fear, neither of you.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.918
You do quite enough for me as it is.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.510
But there's never enough we could
do for you, miss. Not never.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.272
Tell me, Leonard, how fares my boy?

25:50.400 --> 25:55.349
Oh, but he is a stout and fine
young man, as only could be expected.

25:55.480 --> 25:56.390
He is well, then?

25:56.520 --> 25:59.797
He is well cared for, certainly.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.240
But not...

26:02.680 --> 26:04.000
."happy?

26:04.120 --> 26:06.999
How could a boy be happy
without his ma?

26:07.120 --> 26:10.317
But he is kept on a short line.
The woman Chudleigh.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.477
The governess?

26:12.600 --> 26:16.719
As fierce and shrewish a harridan
as ever scolded a boy.

26:16.840 --> 26:21.914
But Mr Dove, he has some feeling
for the boy, I believe.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.680
Took him to Jamrach's today
and bought him a puppy,

26:24.800 --> 26:27.599
<i>so to ease his loneliness.</i>

26:28.960 --> 26:31.236
But, Leonard, do you think...

26:31.360 --> 26:35.240
do you see a way when the time
comes that he might be taken away?

26:36.480 --> 26:39.950
There are Westminster police
on guard day and night,

26:40.080 --> 26:42.310
but the woman Chudleigh
must eat and sleep,

26:42.440 --> 26:44.556
and the gardens.

26:44.680 --> 26:49.595
Mr Dove's gardens, they are bordered
at the back only by the marshes

26:49.720 --> 26:51.393
and that puppy must be exercised.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.352
I see, Leonard.

26:53.480 --> 26:56.040
Albeit slight,
there are opportunities there.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.276
There are.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.358
LONG SUSAN: How do you find Mr Dove?

27:03.480 --> 27:06.040
Too upright by half, as you ask,

27:06.160 --> 27:10.836
and he is distracted by something
which makes him fearful anxious.

27:13.640 --> 27:15.517
Leonard, do you think it's possible,

27:15.640 --> 27:17.313
whilst always, of course,
being most careful,

27:17.440 --> 27:21.149
that you may discover what it is
that makes him so anxious?

27:21.280 --> 27:24.159
Please, Miss Susan.

27:24.280 --> 27:28.513
He already risks so much.
What if he is found out? Leonard?

27:29.840 --> 27:32.354
No, now, come, Myrtle.

27:32.480 --> 27:36.678
We must remind ourselves of all
this good lady has done for us.

27:36.800 --> 27:37.995
I was only a daily fix-it,

27:38.120 --> 27:42.432
paid a penny to clear the guttering at
Tenter Street when the leaves got in

27:42.560 --> 27:45.359
and she encouraged my love for you,

27:45.480 --> 27:47.835
saw that you need earn
in that way no more,

27:47.960 --> 27:49.633
handed us the deposit
for our home here.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.912
Hush, Leonard. You need not go on.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.634
But...

27:56.760 --> 28:01.118
he's my Leonard,
and I would be lost without him.

28:02.680 --> 28:06.196
He means to name the child
after you, if it is a girl.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.118
And even if it is not.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.436
Leonard!

28:10.560 --> 28:12.756
A boy named Susan?

28:14.040 --> 28:16.077
Strong a name as ever there was.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.755
Um...

28:25.480 --> 28:28.074
The, er...the house,

28:28.200 --> 28:31.716
entrances, bedchambers of the occupants.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.910
Do you think you might be
able to draw it for me?

28:37.760 --> 28:39.512
I'm sure I may.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.719
Here, the back stairwell.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.160
This, Mr Dove's rooms,

28:46.280 --> 28:50.160
and this, where your Connor sleeps.

28:50.280 --> 28:53.875
That's the way, brother. Almost home.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.560
(WHISPERS) Right, quick, over here.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.797
Well, do we say a prayer?

29:19.920 --> 29:22.070
Pray that one deception
is believed over the other.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.760
Now, I go to watch for Mathilda's candle.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.714
- I'm sorry, Drum.
- It's not you that lumped me, Tilda.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.399
I might as well have, however.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.750
My father would be grateful
for such loyalty.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.032
They know it was me told you
and you that told him

29:45.160 --> 29:47.959
and he that tied Frank Thatcher
starkers to that pony.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.356
- I am watched.
- By Mr Shine?

29:50.480 --> 29:52.869
He wishes to dice me for his cooking pot.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.110
I shall not ask it of you again, Drum.

30:04.200 --> 30:07.079
Come. Please do not sleep
on the floor tonight.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.079
Tilda, do you not fear
for what folk will say?

30:10.200 --> 30:12.999
Do you not want to be...proper?

30:13.120 --> 30:16.317
Proper? I'm not sure
I know what that means.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.080
But I certainly do not care for others'
definition of it.

30:19.200 --> 30:23.114
All that is proper and true
is that this is good.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.914
All else can go hang.

30:30.200 --> 30:33.158
- Come, Samuel.
- No. No, no, Tilda.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.715
It's not that I lack the desire.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.673
It does not feel right.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.433

30:41.560 --> 30:43.153
No.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.749

has been found, Mr Dove.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.397
Another! Where found? By whom?

32:00.520 --> 32:02.397
The wire says only that
they need your urgent attendance

32:02.520 --> 32:03.919

32:04.040 --> 32:06.919

They are to expect me within the hour.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.156
And wire Jamrach's

- Now!
- Yes, Mr Dove.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.918

33:03.040 --> 33:06.556

of Half Moon Passage, sir.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.633
That is but a spit from this address here.

of this town lack all respect.

This man Croker, your case
was made sound, Mr Dove,

33:18.560 --> 33:20.836
for there is fearful likeness here.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.519
- You will send for a surgeon.
- To what end, sir?

33:28.640 --> 33:30.790
For full autopsy! For certainty!

33:30.920 --> 33:33.275
Certainty? Well...

33:34.320 --> 33:37.039
...that is a luxury,
in my experience, sir.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.791

you will please send to the Yard.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.355
Yes, Mr Dove.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.915
Sirs, the press are come.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.112
Mr Dove!

33:52.240 --> 33:54.595
Might I have some confirmation
concerning the dead man's body

33:54.720 --> 33:57.189
recovered this morning
from Half Moon Passage?

33:57.320 --> 34:02.554
Has this force once more assumed
their tormentor dead when he is not?

34:02.680 --> 34:06.036
There are over 15 witnesses all
describing the work done to the body.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.594
What use our word on it, then, girl?

34:08.639 --> 34:09.710

34:09.840 --> 34:11.353

34:21.800 --> 34:24.713
Sergeant Drummond,
will you brew a pot of tea

34:24.840 --> 34:27.150
and show Miss Castello
to the private office above?

34:27.280 --> 34:30.989
That is if Mr Shine
will allow for the loan of it.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.031
Be my guest.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.079
I am to be granted private interview,
am I?

34:55.120 --> 34:59.353
Perhaps you'll begin by telling me on
what evidence you named the man Croker

34:59.480 --> 35:03.439
and if, as it now seems likely, it was
not he performed these savage acts,

35:03.560 --> 35:06.029
you will now be reopening
the investigation

35:06.160 --> 35:09.073
into the murder of Inspector Bennet Drake.

35:10.240 --> 35:14.234
I shall not be taking questions on
this matter until autopsy is met.

35:14.360 --> 35:16.556
Then why bring me here?

35:16.680 --> 35:19.672
Why not simply make your denial
and cast me out?

35:21.680 --> 35:24.593
You believe yourself
a good journalist, I am sure.

35:24.720 --> 35:28.236
Good, I mean in that you understand
the moral imperative of the truth.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.476
I do.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.238
Perhaps you believe I have, in the past,

35:32.360 --> 35:34.636
been eager to hide such truth from you.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.631
Well, I am tearing it up
from the roots now.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.717
That is a copy, yours to take.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.830
But what you will find is that

35:42.960 --> 35:45.315
the fate to have befallen
Mr Theodore Swift,

35:45.440 --> 35:46.430
buried alive by Edmund Reid,

35:46.560 --> 35:48.551
was far from an isolated occurrence.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.320
Within, the testimony of a man
who once served him.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.512
Proof of this station house's
past iniquity.

35:55.560 --> 35:58.074
Corroborated, extra-judicial murder.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.720
And were you not to print fact,
Miss Castello,

36:09.840 --> 36:12.958
well, I'd need to ask myself
why that was.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.229
Care to share, Mr Dove?

36:34.040 --> 36:36.509

37:04.880 --> 37:08.953
neither myself, Inspector Drake
nor Captain Jackson

37:09.080 --> 37:10.229
could break down the iron grille

37:10.360 --> 37:12.510
which Inspector Reid
had locked behind him.

37:12.640 --> 37:16.713
He would not open it and...and
set about the suspect, Mr Buckley.

37:16.840 --> 37:19.912

head between his hands and...

38:11.160 --> 38:13.276

befallen this neighbourhood

38:42.320 --> 38:43.879
that it is a-burst with women

from the police?

38:50.120 --> 38:51.872

then, Miss Castello.

so recently celebrated.

42:18.560 --> 42:21.791

42:21.920 --> 42:24.912
hidden away for his mania,

42:25.040 --> 42:26.872
escaping to murder,

42:27.000 --> 42:32.439

47:08.680 --> 47:09.795
The world will be safer.

47:09.920 --> 47:11.797
Your Uncle Bennet, others too,
they will have their justice.

47:11.920 --> 47:14.150
And what of you, Father?

47:14.280 --> 47:15.873
All of which you stand accused?

47:16.000 --> 47:19.595
There is much explaining I would do.
I do not say that I am blameless.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.711
- But there is mitigation?
- I hope so.

47:23.400 --> 47:25.960
Mr Buckley was not a big man.

47:26.080 --> 47:28.515
Not nearly as big as you, Father.

47:29.600 --> 47:31.876
Mathilda.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.560
Mathilda, please, we will...

47:34.680 --> 47:35.875
talk of that man in due course,

47:36.000 --> 47:39.516
but first, please hand
this note to Drummond.

47:39.640 --> 47:42.393
You broke his head open on a wood pillar.

47:42.520 --> 47:44.796
You smashed his brains from him.

47:46.200 --> 47:47.679
There is a testimony from Bobby Grace.

47:47.800 --> 47:51.714
No shard of glass, no necessary
defence of yourself. Only murder.

47:51.840 --> 47:54.480
A defenceless man killed
in cold blood by your hand.

47:54.600 --> 47:57.240
I was told that you were dead,

47:57.360 --> 47:59.078
dead for all that he had done to you,

47:59.200 --> 48:02.272
terrible, dread things
done to you in his captivity.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.310
But he did not...

48:03.440 --> 48:05.750
Yes, but I was told this.

48:05.880 --> 48:09.510
I was assured this. I cannot be blamed.

48:09.640 --> 48:12.314
He took you from me, Mathilda!
Do you not see?

48:12.440 --> 48:13.760
No!

48:13.880 --> 48:15.473
He kept me safe!

48:15.600 --> 48:16.670
From you.

48:18.400 --> 48:21.916
Mathilda, Mathilda, I will explain.
All will be explained.

48:22.040 --> 48:24.156
The Captain. Susan Hart,
she who lied to me.

48:24.280 --> 48:26.510
But first...

48:26.640 --> 48:28.870
The note. Tell Drummond.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.116
All will be right again.

of all the evil ever born?

48:49.640 --> 48:52.553
Mr Reid. I will talk to her.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.398
My word on it.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.636
Should we live, be free,
I will not leave this city

48:56.760 --> 48:59.354
until I have made her
understand the truth.

49:05.120 --> 49:07.760
No. Not you.

49:07.880 --> 49:10.235
Not by my side. You are no ally of mine.

49:12.360 --> 49:15.751
Get to Leonard. He has done
all he might for us now.

49:15.880 --> 49:18.713
Get him out of there.
We'll meet you after.

I'm glad to have found you, brother.

- Have you...?
- It doesn't matter.

50:27.560 --> 50:28.470
But I was certain

50:28.600 --> 50:33.071
the news of such rare beasts landing
on this shoreline would draw you out.

50:39.080 --> 50:42.357
Nathaniel, there is a savaged man found.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.518
- It is not...by your action?
- Gustus, I have not...

50:45.640 --> 50:47.119
Felt the hunger?

50:48.680 --> 50:50.591
Well,

50:50.720 --> 50:52.757
I feel it, yes.

50:52.880 --> 50:57.397
But I feel also that it may be withstood.

51:01.160 --> 51:03.276
Then I am glad.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.911
They are magnificent.

51:33.920 --> 51:35.672
You seem very sure of yourself, sir.

51:35.800 --> 51:37.996
Of certain things, Mr Reid, yes, I am.

51:38.120 --> 51:40.316
And so how will you explain
your kinship with this man

51:40.440 --> 51:42.078
when the men of H Division arrive?

51:42.200 --> 51:43.156

if they are not instructed to do so.
