00:27.137 --> 00:30.473
Have you ever witnessed
Frank Mantajano kill anyone?

00:30.640 --> 00:33.852
I've heard about it,
but it's not an everyday occurrence.

00:33.977 --> 00:38.565
- Have you witnessed him kill anyone?
- People say things. You pick up on it.

00:38.731 --> 00:40.400
It gets around the block.

00:40.525 --> 00:44.696
Have you ever witnessed Frank
Mantajano in any kind of illegal activity?

00:44.863 --> 00:48.241
Have you ever witnessed him
in any kind of illegal activity?

00:48.449 --> 00:52.120
Again, as far as I'm concerned,
the guy did right by me.

00:52.287 --> 00:55.456
- Who hired you?
- I would assume it's Frank.

00:55.665 --> 00:59.669
- How long have you worked for him?
- We ran together in younger days.

00:59.836 --> 01:03.047
- How long have you worked for him?
- We dated the same girl.

01:03.214 --> 01:05.592
We had the same friends on the streets.

01:06.968 --> 01:09.053
That kind of stuff. Things happen.

01:13.057 --> 01:15.894
Somebody ordered a takeout.

01:19.188 --> 01:21.024
Good night.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.614
Your answers have to come faster.
This is a federal case.

01:27.780 --> 01:31.868
You've got to have your ducks in a row
if we're gonna nail Frank Mantajano. OK?

01:33.703 --> 01:36.456
- Can we take a break? I'm hungry.
- OK.

01:37.415 --> 01:40.877
But remember, you're gonna be
on the stand for hours at a time.

01:41.044 --> 01:45.590
You've got to watch your body language,
your facial expressions, your posture.

01:45.715 --> 01:48.718
To be effective, the committee
has to like you. Get it?

01:48.843 --> 01:50.845
I got it.

01:51.012 --> 01:55.516
- Got any Szechwan chicken over there?
- Could you get him some chicken?

04:45.102 --> 04:49.523
Mr Paine, does the Attorney General's
office have any final remarks?

04:49.690 --> 04:54.028
May I remind the committee that Frank
Mantajano is an execrable criminal,

04:54.153 --> 04:56.864
moving Cuban organized crime
into America.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.659
I object to that characterization
of my client.

04:59.825 --> 05:04.330
The Attorney General's office is making
accusations, disguising them as truth.

05:04.497 --> 05:07.750
The fact is, my client
has never been convicted of any crime.

05:07.917 --> 05:10.878
- But he will be, Mr Foster.
- That's enough, gentlemen.

05:11.045 --> 05:14.131
This committee will stand in recess
until 10am Monday,

05:14.340 --> 05:18.678
at which time I hope that the Attorney
General's office will have evidence

05:18.844 --> 05:21.347
to back up their accusations.

05:21.514 --> 05:25.643
- I'll produce it all right.
- Good. We're adjourned.

05:26.602 --> 05:28.646
Our witness is dead.

05:38.489 --> 05:40.074
My witness is dead?

05:40.241 --> 05:43.786
- Mantajano's people got to him.
- He was in a safe house. How?

05:43.953 --> 05:47.248
Some Cuban delivered him
a carton of Chinese food full of C-4.

05:47.415 --> 05:51.502
I just told the Committee on Organized
Crime and 60 million TV viewers

05:51.669 --> 05:54.088
that I would produce a witness
in 72 hours.

05:54.213 --> 05:56.799
I understand,
but what are we going to do about it?

05:57.007 --> 06:00.302
"We"? As a federal marshal,
you are directly responsible

06:00.469 --> 06:03.472
for the custody and protection
of all witnesses.

06:03.639 --> 06:06.183
So the problem is,
you got my witness killed.

06:06.350 --> 06:09.437
You do something about it
by Monday morning

06:10.646 --> 06:13.691
or start thinking about
an early retirement.

07:02.406 --> 07:04.408
Sweet little kitty.

07:04.575 --> 07:06.660
Got them virgin hands.

07:08.454 --> 07:12.541
Cute little kitty cat like you
ain't supposed to be shovellin' ditches.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.252
This here is man's work.

07:16.545 --> 07:18.756
Hey, bitch, are you listenin' to me?

07:19.548 --> 07:23.844
You know, I'm lookin' for a little pussy
like you to keep me warm at night.

07:26.805 --> 07:30.351
Now that's using your head. Come on!

07:39.360 --> 07:42.071
Don't you think
he's had enough, convict?

07:43.364 --> 07:46.158
You been here one day.
You wanna fight everybody?

07:46.325 --> 07:50.037
- I ain't supposed to be here.
- Ain't nobody supposed to be here.

07:50.829 --> 07:53.916
Break it up!
Get your big ass out of the way.

07:54.792 --> 07:58.253
- Causin' problems already, Piper?
- I had nothin' to do with it.

07:58.379 --> 07:59.797
- It's true.
- Shut up, Dodge.

07:59.964 --> 08:03.467
- Wait a minute.
- I said shut the fuck up!

08:04.259 --> 08:06.220
You guys need an attitude adjustment.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.722
I got just the thing for you.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.891
All right, Kevin.

08:21.944 --> 08:24.196
Kinda like a wedding ring.

08:24.363 --> 08:27.324
I now pronounce you
convict... and convict.

08:27.491 --> 08:29.493
Now get the fuck on the bus.

08:33.539 --> 08:36.041
You move when I say you move.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.208
Right.

08:43.674 --> 08:45.467
Come on.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.269
- Should we break it up now?
- No.

08:55.394 --> 08:58.230
Just keep a lookout
and watch for my signal.

09:36.894 --> 09:38.854
Gimme the keys to the bus.

10:06.798 --> 10:08.634
- What's goin' on?
- How should I know?

10:10.052 --> 10:12.054
Radio for help.

10:24.983 --> 10:26.985
- Let's go.
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

10:27.110 --> 10:28.946
You move when I say you move!

10:30.072 --> 10:31.823
Here, pussy, pussy...

10:34.368 --> 10:36.620
Let's get outta here.

11:19.871 --> 11:24.001
- Anything else, Gib?
- I ain't got nowhere to put it, honey.

11:24.126 --> 11:27.087
- Hey, Gib.
- What's goin' on, Sandra?

11:27.587 --> 11:31.800
You. Lieutenant Clark says meet him
at Gwinnett County Detention Center.

11:32.009 --> 11:34.928
- He say why?
- Nope, but he's waitin' on ya.

11:35.137 --> 11:37.222
How are the ribs today?

11:37.347 --> 11:41.435
Same as they were yesterday,
and the day before, and the day before.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.311
- I'll see ya.
- See ya, Gib.

11:43.854 --> 11:45.439
Get me a half a slab of rib

11:45.605 --> 11:47.607
- and a peach cobbler.
- You got it.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.994
- Hey, Gib.
- Afternoon, Warden. What's up?

11:59.161 --> 12:00.912
Prison break.

12:01.079 --> 12:03.665
- Who fled?
- There's three of 'em took off.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.835
Paul Milliner, Charles Piper
and some kid named Dodge.

12:07.002 --> 12:10.839
Dodge? That explains why
the Lieutenant called me out here.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.216
I busted him about nine months back.

12:13.383 --> 12:16.261
- What's he done now?
- From what we can gather,

12:16.428 --> 12:19.931
Piper and Dodge got into a brawl,
distracting the guard,

12:20.056 --> 12:22.934
and this fuck Milliner
grabbed Kevin's gun.

12:23.101 --> 12:29.065
The three of 'em started shootin'. They
killed Kevin, Bailey and two other guards.

12:29.232 --> 12:32.569
- Dodge killed someone?
- Afternoon, Gibson. Warden Nichols.

12:32.736 --> 12:35.947
This is Marshal Schiller,
Attorney General's office.

12:36.281 --> 12:38.825
Welcome to the land
of CNN and Coca-Cola.

12:38.992 --> 12:43.872
We don't want to be on CNN and hope not
to get too thirsty capturing these fugitives.

12:44.039 --> 12:46.041
The Marshal will head the manhunt.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.210
Since you arrested Dodge,

12:48.418 --> 12:52.172
you can give Schiller a jump-start
on where to look for these boys.

12:52.339 --> 12:56.259
He's probably headin' back to Atlanta,
about 30 miles from here.

12:56.426 --> 13:00.805
If we put out an all-points and local news
profiles, we should have 'em by nightfall.

13:03.058 --> 13:05.477
Let me talk to you
for a minute, Matthew.

13:08.063 --> 13:12.859
This guy Schiller is no regular cop. He
was sent by the Attorney General's office.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.028
They want a press blackout on this.

13:15.445 --> 13:18.490
- We do want to catch these boys, right?
- Damn right.

13:18.657 --> 13:22.160
But we don't want police reports
all over the six o'clock news.

13:23.078 --> 13:27.666
So I'm supposed to play Seeing Eye dog
to the Attorney General's trigger man

13:27.832 --> 13:29.834
without askin' what, when or why.

13:30.001 --> 13:34.381
My job is to make sure you give
these boys what they need. Are we clear?

13:35.340 --> 13:38.134
- Yeah. We're clear.
- Good.

13:38.343 --> 13:41.930
Now let's get Marshal Schiller
on these fugitives' trail.

13:42.097 --> 13:44.099
Right.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.877
Hold up a second.

14:13.461 --> 14:16.214
Shit. What are you doing?

14:21.553 --> 14:23.179
Shit.

14:26.224 --> 14:28.226
Are you done?

14:28.351 --> 14:31.021
Not unless you wanna
wipe it off for me, convict.

14:32.397 --> 14:34.524
Let's go.

14:40.488 --> 14:43.283
If we position ourselves here,
they'll be cornered.

14:43.700 --> 14:47.787
If we do that, we leave this whole area
along the river open to the city.

14:47.954 --> 14:51.416
I've been doing this ten years.
They're headed for the border.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.918
They want to leave Georgia
as fast as possible.

14:54.085 --> 14:57.881
- Why do you think they're all together?
- Let's mount up and move out.

14:58.048 --> 15:00.050
You heard the man. Let's do it.

15:14.355 --> 15:16.483
Never seen nothin' like it in 20 years.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.778
What's a US marshal
like Schiller doin' here

15:19.903 --> 15:22.572
on a local manhunt
for some minor criminal?

15:23.072 --> 15:28.453
These guys shot up a whole road crew.
They should be shot for what they done.

15:28.578 --> 15:32.123
- I'm not sure they done anything.
- What is that supposed to mean?

15:32.624 --> 15:37.295
I brought Dodge in for hackin' into
some telephone computer system.

15:37.504 --> 15:41.966
They only gave him 18 months. He's
served nine. Why would he break out?

15:42.133 --> 15:45.929
All I know is he left a good friend of mine
dead out on that road.

15:46.095 --> 15:49.641
That's my point. What was Dodge
doin' there in the first place?

15:51.267 --> 15:55.480
Just a prison ordinance.
A routine directive.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.982
You make the directives, Dale.

15:58.107 --> 16:00.860
Road crews, chain gangs, are reserved

16:01.027 --> 16:03.863
for felons with
five-year sentences or more.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.991
So what was Dodge doin' on that road?

16:08.368 --> 16:11.579
We got a call
from the Attorney General's office.

16:11.746 --> 16:13.748
They wanted Dodge out there.

16:14.499 --> 16:17.377
- Why would they want him out there?
- I don't know.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.922
They've been tryin' to question him
since we had him in lockup.

16:21.089 --> 16:24.926
You got to believe me, Gib.
I had no idea this was gonna happen.

16:25.093 --> 16:27.679
Attention all units. Suspects spotted...

16:27.845 --> 16:30.098
There. Schiller's closin' in on 'em now.

16:30.306 --> 16:31.641
- Stop the car.
- What?

16:31.808 --> 16:33.434
Stop the goddamn car!

16:52.287 --> 16:54.497
- Come on!
- Hold up.

16:54.664 --> 16:58.167
- What's the problem?
- You're draggin' me like a rag doll.

16:58.334 --> 17:01.379
You almost ripped my arm off
twice back there. Shit.

17:01.546 --> 17:04.965
- We gotta get into a rhythm.
- What the fuck you know about rhythm?

17:05.758 --> 17:09.137
- I'm a foster child, raised by the state.
- What's your point?

17:09.262 --> 17:13.182
There was this caretaker who was
like a father to me. His name was Titus.

17:13.308 --> 17:16.810
He taught me that everybody
lives their life according to a rhythm.

17:16.978 --> 17:20.315
You make love to a rhythm.
Your heart beats to a rhythm.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.984
If we're gonna run together,
we gotta get into the same rhythm.

17:24.152 --> 17:26.154
I got your rhythm, convict.

17:56.517 --> 17:59.645
If we hurry, we can get you back
in time for evenin' chow.

18:02.565 --> 18:03.524
Goddamn.

19:31.237 --> 19:33.322
Something's down there. Check it out.

19:50.047 --> 19:51.424
Wait! Look.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.635
- In there?
- Yeah. Let's go.

20:02.727 --> 20:06.147
- How do we get to the state line?
- We don't wanna go there.

20:06.355 --> 20:07.648
Why not?

20:07.815 --> 20:09.400
Come on!

20:10.151 --> 20:12.153
Didn't you see "The Fugitive"?

20:12.361 --> 20:16.032
The first thing Tommy Lee Jones did
was set up roadblocks at the state line.

20:16.198 --> 20:19.869
- That's your plan, Dr Kimble?
- I ain't got a plan.

20:19.994 --> 20:23.497
- I'm trying to figure this shit out as we go.
- No shit!

20:26.792 --> 20:29.462
- All right. I say we give ourselves up.
- What?!

20:29.670 --> 20:32.214
- You're jokin', right?
- I look like I'm jokin'?

20:32.381 --> 20:35.092
- It was your idea to run.
- People shoot at me, I run.

20:35.259 --> 20:37.219
Your white ass didn't know shit.

20:37.386 --> 20:40.848
- So you don't like white people now?
- No, I just don't like you.

20:44.352 --> 20:48.356
I got nothin' against whites. I just ain't
had many good experiences with 'em.

20:48.522 --> 20:51.859
Fuck! I was out in six months.
Six months I was goin' home.

20:52.068 --> 20:54.445
Yeah? Forget about that six months shit.

20:54.612 --> 20:59.158
You can add on another 12 to 18 months
because you ran, no matter what you say.

20:59.325 --> 21:02.328
You are a convict.
Nothing is ever gonna change that.

21:02.453 --> 21:04.580
That's your reality, baby, not mine.

21:04.705 --> 21:07.500
My reality and yours are the same.
We're both fucked.

21:07.625 --> 21:10.669
- Not me. I take my chances.
- Not with my life, you don't.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.028
All right, all right! Hold up.

21:36.987 --> 21:38.322
- How much?
- What?

21:38.447 --> 21:41.534
- Name your price.
- You ain't got shit to bargain with.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.120
- I got more than you think.
- What do you mean?

21:44.245 --> 21:47.123
I'm talkin' about five million dollars.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.377
I got your attention now, convict?

21:51.544 --> 21:54.630
What do you think I was locked up for?
Runnin' a red light?

21:54.755 --> 21:57.466
I hit a major corporation
for five million.

21:57.591 --> 21:59.468
- You're lyin'.
- Am I?

22:00.052 --> 22:03.055
All right! Hold on. Why would I lie?

22:03.222 --> 22:06.267
One: to keep me from kickin' your ass.
Two: same reason.

22:06.475 --> 22:09.186
Three: prison life
ain't exactly worked out for you.

22:09.395 --> 22:12.189
That's why I'm offerin' you
a million dollars.

22:12.356 --> 22:14.400
More than you'll ever see in your life.

22:14.608 --> 22:18.654
Yeah. I'll be lookin' over my shoulder
for the rest of my life, too.

22:18.779 --> 22:21.907
What else will you do when you get out?
Work for 7-Eleven?

22:22.074 --> 22:23.909
They ain't hiring convicts.

22:24.034 --> 22:25.911
You think about that.

22:30.708 --> 22:34.670
- All right, I want half.
- Half? Fuck you! This ain't divorce.

22:34.879 --> 22:36.547
No. We married, baby.

22:36.714 --> 22:40.801
For better, for worse, in sickness
and in health, till death do us part.

22:43.429 --> 22:47.016
The chopper's comin' back around,
Dodge. You better hurry up.

22:47.391 --> 22:50.728
Come on, baby. Say "I do."

22:53.772 --> 22:56.025
Shit! All right - half.

22:56.650 --> 22:59.278
- But after that, that is it! We are even.
- No.

23:00.738 --> 23:02.740
Now we're even.

23:23.552 --> 23:25.888
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

23:26.013 --> 23:28.432
- Which way?
- This way.

23:34.271 --> 23:35.689
What?

23:35.856 --> 23:37.858
Nothin'.

23:42.112 --> 23:44.656
- What the hell is that?
- Sounds like a train.

23:46.992 --> 23:47.910
Run!

23:56.919 --> 23:59.254
Let's go!

24:02.800 --> 24:04.551
- We won't make it.
- We have to jump.

24:04.718 --> 24:06.303
I can't swim!

24:06.512 --> 24:09.139
I never met a white boy
that couldn't swim.

24:21.819 --> 24:24.279
- Keep your head up.
- OK.

24:41.922 --> 24:43.924
First thing I'm gonna do

24:44.091 --> 24:46.093
when this shit is over

24:46.301 --> 24:48.428
is set my ass

24:48.554 --> 24:52.516
in a steamy, hot, bubble bath.

24:52.641 --> 24:53.851
You know?

24:55.769 --> 24:58.230
I hope you choke
and drown on the bubbles.

25:05.028 --> 25:07.614
What are you doin'
chained to that white boy?

25:08.282 --> 25:12.161
You know, I've been askin' myself
the same damn question all day.

25:12.327 --> 25:15.497
Now look here, chief.
I know what you're thinkin', boss.

25:15.664 --> 25:19.376
You got two convicts. If you turn us in,
maybe you'll make some money.

25:19.543 --> 25:21.545
Might even get your face on TV. Right?

25:21.712 --> 25:25.382
Maybe I oughta shoot your black ass
right now and call it a day.

25:25.799 --> 25:29.094
Why not? In fact, why not have
an old-fashioned lynchin'?

25:29.219 --> 25:31.889
Y'all still hang niggers
in Georgia, dontcha?

25:33.223 --> 25:35.267
He's such a kidder! Would you excuse me?

25:35.392 --> 25:37.394
- He's got a gun.
- And we don't.

25:37.561 --> 25:40.564
Quit provoking him.
He doesn't want to shoot us. Right?

25:40.731 --> 25:44.610
He won't shoot you, but he damn sure
wants to blow a hole in my black ass.

25:44.776 --> 25:48.196
- Dontcha, boss?
- Hold on. We don't want any trouble.

25:48.405 --> 25:50.574
Don't do anything you'll regret later.

25:50.699 --> 25:54.661
Now, I can see that you're a fine,
upstanding member of your community.

25:54.786 --> 25:58.749
And, despite our appearance,
I can assure you we are not bad people.

25:58.874 --> 26:01.418
- Fuck this. He's a redneck.
- Don't say that!

26:01.627 --> 26:04.463
- He is. Show him your neck.
- Shut up.

26:04.671 --> 26:06.173
Show him your neck!

26:09.509 --> 26:11.762
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- What?

26:11.928 --> 26:14.973
- Didn't you see "Deliverance"?
- We're alive, ain't we?

26:15.098 --> 26:18.060
- What if he'd shot sooner?
- Then we'd be dead.

26:18.226 --> 26:19.895
- Shit.
- What?

26:20.062 --> 26:21.813
- We got a problem.
- What?

26:22.022 --> 26:23.774
He ain't breathin'.

26:25.359 --> 26:27.361
- Shit.
- What?

26:27.527 --> 26:29.529
He's havin' a heart attack.

26:34.159 --> 26:36.828
- Turn the radio down.
- This is a good song.

26:36.995 --> 26:39.706
It'd be nice to hear the cops
before they get to us.

26:39.873 --> 26:42.584
All right, all right.

26:43.168 --> 26:45.837
We gotta get him to a hospital.
Where is it?

26:46.004 --> 26:48.590
It's comin' up. We'll get there.

26:48.715 --> 26:51.385
Where'd you learn first aid, anyway?

26:51.551 --> 26:54.221
In the joint. CPR.
They got courses like that.

26:56.014 --> 26:58.016
A Suzuki.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.229
Nice bikes.

27:02.396 --> 27:06.400
While you take that bubble bath,
I'll get a Ducati 916 racing motorcycle.

27:06.566 --> 27:09.945
- Ride off into the sunset.
- I won't be sorry to see your ass go.

27:11.238 --> 27:13.240
Shit! Look at this.

27:13.407 --> 27:15.742
- Put that away.
- We can shoot the cuffs off.

27:15.951 --> 27:19.663
Don't point it at me!
Gimme that before you hurt yourself.

27:19.830 --> 27:22.249
How would I know?
I never even held a gun.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.627
Then how the hell'd you rob somebody
for five million dollars?

27:26.044 --> 27:28.338
Hackin', my friend. Hackin'.

27:28.672 --> 27:30.674
- Computers?
- You got it.

27:30.841 --> 27:32.843
I got the sweetest Mac 5300.

27:33.009 --> 27:35.262
16 megabytes, 750 hard drive.

27:35.429 --> 27:38.682
So fast, it's like
the Ducati of computers.

27:39.182 --> 27:43.103
On the Internet,
my call name is the Cyberthug.

27:45.272 --> 27:48.024
- What's so funny?
- That ain't no robbery, man.

27:48.191 --> 27:51.695
One of these, a ski mask -
that's a robbery.

27:51.820 --> 27:54.322
I didn't get busted for robbery.
All right?

27:54.489 --> 27:57.868
I illegally accessed
the phone company's computer system.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.495
- You robbed Ma Bell?
- No, not exactly.

28:00.662 --> 28:02.664
Ma Bell just gave me a little help.

28:03.456 --> 28:07.919
I used the phone company's computer to
access the accounts of a big corporation.

28:08.086 --> 28:10.088
- Which one?
- A greedy one.

28:10.213 --> 28:12.966
They took and never gave back.
I taught 'em a lesson.

28:13.133 --> 28:16.887
- Real nice, but how'd you get the money?
- Once I was in, it was easy.

28:17.095 --> 28:21.183
I transferred money from their accounts
into a dummy company I had set up.

28:21.308 --> 28:26.563
I wrote a corporate cheque to a friend.
He closed the account, gave me the cash.

28:27.022 --> 28:29.232
Very smooth.

28:29.399 --> 28:31.401
So who's your friend?

28:31.526 --> 28:34.779
- You writin' a book?
- I wanna know who's sharin' my money.

28:41.244 --> 28:42.829
Everything was planned, sir.

28:42.996 --> 28:47.417
I can't control it if some convict
starts shootin' up the road crew.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.628
He won't be shootin' anybody else.

28:49.794 --> 28:53.340
The most important thing is
Dodge is on the move and we are on him.

28:53.506 --> 28:55.967
The locals have no idea what's goin' on.

28:59.930 --> 29:02.724
Politicians put a lot of pressure
on you with this, huh?

29:03.224 --> 29:06.394
- You mean the Attorney General's office.
- Right.

29:06.561 --> 29:09.898
- Who said I was talkin' to them?
- You just did.

29:10.690 --> 29:15.320
- You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
- Nope. Just average for a country boy.

29:15.487 --> 29:20.283
- Did you notify the fugitive's next of kin?
- They're not a priority on my list.

29:20.992 --> 29:23.453
What exactly is a priority on your list?

29:24.704 --> 29:27.499
Bringing these fugitives to justice.

29:27.999 --> 29:31.252
My hunch is
they're more pawns than fugitives.

29:31.461 --> 29:36.257
It seems to me your hunches are more
like a Hardy Boys mystery than real life.

29:37.008 --> 29:40.387
And I think that
you are spittin' in the wind.

29:40.595 --> 29:43.848
And you know what they say
about spittin' in the wind.

29:45.433 --> 29:47.435
It can blow back in your face.

30:24.806 --> 30:28.560
- Come on. Hurry up, man.
- I'm fixing him so he won't fall over.

30:28.685 --> 30:30.687
Pop the brake.

30:30.854 --> 30:35.358
- Come on, before somebody sees us.
- All right. Ready? One, two, three.

30:36.192 --> 30:37.694
Push.

30:58.006 --> 30:59.549
Shit!

31:47.013 --> 31:50.934
What the hell's wrong with you, kid?
You almost got yourself killed.

31:51.059 --> 31:54.145
Forget that. Why do you guys
have those chains on?

31:54.312 --> 31:56.564
Go on, beat it. You bother me.

31:59.901 --> 32:01.903
- Son of a bitch. They did it!
- What?

32:02.111 --> 32:04.822
They built a recreational centre
and a playground.

32:04.989 --> 32:06.991
- Who?
- Brigantine International.

32:07.200 --> 32:11.037
- That's who I hit for the $25 million.
- You said five, you lyin' SOB.

32:11.245 --> 32:13.915
When I was in their computer system,
I hit 'em for 25.

32:14.082 --> 32:16.834
But I only kept five.
I gave 20 to charity. Like this.

32:23.466 --> 32:26.552
Shit! That's nice, Robin Hood,
but we gotta fled. Come on.

32:28.596 --> 32:30.598
Don't do anything stupid!

32:30.765 --> 32:32.767
- It's OK. Just drive.
- Look, guys.

32:32.892 --> 32:35.478
I have groceries in the back
and about $20.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.564
- Take it and get out.
- You don't tell us. We tell you.

32:38.773 --> 32:40.858
Come on. Put that away. All right?

32:41.651 --> 32:44.946
We don't want your money or your car.
We just want a ride.

32:45.071 --> 32:47.615
- Let's go! Drive.
- All right. All right.

32:47.782 --> 32:50.243
- Where to?
- I don't know.

32:50.410 --> 32:52.787
- Where do you live?
- Three blocks that way.

32:52.996 --> 32:55.164
- OK. We'll go there.
- My house?

32:55.289 --> 32:57.041
- Let's go!
- All right, all right!

32:57.208 --> 32:59.377
But I'm warning you, it's messy.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.902
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

33:34.203 --> 33:37.206
- Workin' hard as usual, Jocelyn?
- Well, not as usual.

33:37.373 --> 33:40.918
And what are you doin' here?
Got a problem with your insurance?

33:41.043 --> 33:43.504
No. I'm here tryin' to figure
something out.

33:43.671 --> 33:48.885
- What are you tryin' to figure out?
- Well, I busted this kid, name of Dodge,

33:49.093 --> 33:52.513
for hackin' into
a telephone company's computer system.

33:52.680 --> 33:56.809
They've also listed a bunch of
other companies and different offences.

33:57.351 --> 34:01.981
He used the phone company's computer
to get into other companies' systems.

34:02.190 --> 34:06.736
That's what I figured. But these people
here, Brigantine International,

34:06.903 --> 34:10.197
they didn't list any offences,
nor did they press charges.

34:10.406 --> 34:13.826
- Let me check on Central's computer.
- That would be wonderful.

34:13.993 --> 34:16.829
Someone else accessed
this information today.

34:17.163 --> 34:19.748
- Who was that?
- Savannah Detective Agency.

34:21.208 --> 34:23.793
According to this,
they're a holding company

34:23.920 --> 34:27.672
for corporations with offshore accounts
in Europe and South America.

34:28.882 --> 34:32.594
Can you figure out on that thing
who owns Brigantine International?

34:36.306 --> 34:39.018
The primary stockholder
is a Frank Mantajano.

34:39.143 --> 34:41.228
- Manta-hano.
- Whatever.

35:10.633 --> 35:12.677
Beautiful vessel, isn't she?

35:14.178 --> 35:17.139
- Would you like a drink?
- No. I don't drink.

35:17.306 --> 35:19.308
Tobacco?

35:20.893 --> 35:24.397
I want to congratulate you on your...
Chinese cooking.

35:27.233 --> 35:28.985
I enjoy my work.

35:29.151 --> 35:31.487
We want to commission you
to do another job.

35:31.654 --> 35:33.656
We want you to locate Luke Dodge,

35:33.864 --> 35:36.742
a convict that escaped
from a Georgia prison today.

35:36.951 --> 35:39.036
We need to find him before Monday.

35:39.537 --> 35:42.164
He has a computer disk
that belongs to us.

35:42.289 --> 35:45.167
All of our accounting information
is on that disk.

35:45.292 --> 35:47.962
We want you to retrieve the disk,
then terminate him.

35:48.170 --> 35:51.924
We have a contact in Atlanta
that will provide you with a lead

35:52.091 --> 35:54.635
as to where Luke Dodge
might go to first.

35:55.845 --> 36:00.349
It's only for information, Santiago.
He won't get in your way.

36:02.643 --> 36:04.854
It's done.

36:25.207 --> 36:27.960
- Where do you want these?
- In the kitchen.

36:29.044 --> 36:31.046
What a chivalrous convict.

36:32.256 --> 36:34.592
You got something
to cut these cuffs with?

36:34.759 --> 36:36.719
Under the sink.

36:50.441 --> 36:53.694
- Hold the chain.
- All right, all right. Easy.

36:54.820 --> 36:57.615
- Where are you goin'?
- To the bathroom. Do you mind?

36:57.782 --> 36:59.825
- Yes, I do. Wait a minute.
- What?

37:00.659 --> 37:02.703
Didn't you see "The Godfather"?

37:05.247 --> 37:10.794
The restaurant scene when Michael blows
everybody's freakin' head off. Forget it.

37:12.046 --> 37:14.507
Go ahead. It's OK.

37:14.965 --> 37:16.967
Thank you.

37:21.639 --> 37:25.392
- What is your problem, man?
- What the hell's goin' on with you two?

37:25.559 --> 37:29.688
First the thing with the gun, now you're
carrying groceries, speaking Spanish...

37:29.897 --> 37:31.982
And then this. Are you a Boy Scout now?

37:32.483 --> 37:35.319
Just cos I been locked up
don't mean I got no manners.

37:35.486 --> 37:39.198
You don't bust into somebody's home
and tell 'em what to do.

37:39.323 --> 37:42.076
She could be in the other room
callin' the cops.

37:44.578 --> 37:45.955
Hold on.

37:48.415 --> 37:50.834
Come on!

37:51.001 --> 37:54.588
I thought you two bandidos
might need a new disguise.

37:56.090 --> 37:58.217
My ex-husband was about your size.

37:58.968 --> 38:00.469
But you...

38:00.636 --> 38:03.514
You might be a little
too small for this.

38:04.348 --> 38:08.477
They smell like mothballs because they
were packed away for a very long time.

38:08.686 --> 38:12.356
But they will certainly smell better
than what you have on.

38:12.940 --> 38:15.109
Jesus. What is it?

38:15.234 --> 38:16.819
Thank you.

38:17.444 --> 38:19.822
Where did you get a key for the cuffs?

38:19.947 --> 38:22.157
My ex-husband.

38:22.283 --> 38:24.535
He's a cop.

38:34.336 --> 38:38.382
I wonder what it feels like to want to be
a politician and not hold office.

38:38.507 --> 38:40.342
Like a cop without a job.

38:40.467 --> 38:43.846
I talked to Schiller. You ain't makin'
any friends mouthin' off.

38:44.013 --> 38:47.808
Well, I'm not tryin' to make any friends.
I'm tryin' to do my job.

38:47.975 --> 38:50.561
Oh, yeah? What job might that be?

38:50.936 --> 38:54.273
Say, where are you goin'?
Let me talk to you for a second.

38:54.481 --> 38:58.736
Why do you think the Attorney General
and a US marshal are involved in this?

38:58.902 --> 39:02.823
They're following orders from superiors -
which you can't seem to do.

39:02.948 --> 39:04.491
Would you listen for a sec?

39:05.826 --> 39:11.665
Warden Nichols said the Attorney General
had Dodge placed on that road crew.

39:11.832 --> 39:16.211
Plus, Dodge hacked into Brigantine
International's computer system.

39:16.378 --> 39:20.032
- Why don't we have a record of it?
- Because the key stockholder

39:20.132 --> 39:24.720
is a Frank Mantajano, who is currently
under indictment by the Attorney General.

39:24.845 --> 39:26.013
So?

39:26.180 --> 39:29.516
So whatever Dodge discovered
inside their computer system,

39:29.683 --> 39:31.643
they wanna keep it secret.

39:31.810 --> 39:35.856
Great police work. Maybe I can
get you assigned to the Hoffa case next!

39:36.023 --> 39:38.025
Henry!

39:39.818 --> 39:41.904
Are you outta your fuckin' mind?

39:42.029 --> 39:45.949
Blanks. Found 'em on the road
where Dodge escaped. Police issue.

39:47.785 --> 39:49.787
It's all right. It's OK.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.171
Listen. I don't have all the pieces
to the puzzle yet, but just think about it.

39:59.338 --> 40:02.549
Dodge makes off with $25 million
of Mantajano's money

40:02.758 --> 40:05.135
and the corporation
doesn't press charges.

40:05.302 --> 40:07.554
This is evidence. Did you tell Schiller?

40:07.763 --> 40:11.099
My guess is he knows. He had Dodge
put on that road so he'd run.

40:11.225 --> 40:15.312
But things went sour. People died.
So Schiller wants this out of the press.

40:15.479 --> 40:19.191
- What the hell does that prove?
- What it proves, right,

40:19.316 --> 40:22.444
is that Dodge has something big
on Mantajano

40:22.611 --> 40:25.239
and the Attorney General wants it bad.

40:25.781 --> 40:28.075
Now, I have got a hunch,

40:28.283 --> 40:32.329
and I need an old friend to turn his back
for 24 hours so I can play it out.

40:34.164 --> 40:37.751
OK, you got 24 hours. Not a minute more.
And, Matthew,

40:38.252 --> 40:41.213
you fuck this up,
friend or no friend, it's your ass.

40:41.630 --> 40:43.715
I know, Henry. Believe me, I know.

41:05.445 --> 41:07.573
So where'd you meet your husband?

41:10.534 --> 41:12.536
Well...

41:12.703 --> 41:15.998
I was sneaking across the border
and he caught me.

41:16.790 --> 41:18.792
So he deported me back to Mexico.

41:21.586 --> 41:23.755
But he asked me for my phone number.

41:24.840 --> 41:27.301
So first, he started calling.

41:28.468 --> 41:30.470
Then visiting.

41:31.513 --> 41:34.474
Then we fell in love and got married.

41:36.184 --> 41:38.186
And he brought me to the States.

41:38.312 --> 41:40.397
First to California.

41:41.273 --> 41:44.234
And then we moved to Atlanta, Georgia.

41:44.818 --> 41:47.321
And then what happened?

41:48.405 --> 41:50.407
He left me.

41:51.450 --> 41:58.206
So, I was stuck here with no money,
no friends, no family... and no job.

42:06.798 --> 42:09.468
- So what'd you do?
- I cried.

42:09.593 --> 42:11.303
I cried for a long time.

42:11.470 --> 42:13.096
Then I got my shit together.

42:13.221 --> 42:16.850
My mother had taught me how to cook.
So that's what I do.

42:17.893 --> 42:21.688
- You work in a restaurant?
- No. I'm self-employed. I'm a caterer.

42:21.813 --> 42:24.566
I make my own tortillas
and all the sauces.

42:24.691 --> 42:26.610
That's my speciality - a mole.

42:27.569 --> 42:29.613
- What's mole?
- You wanna try some?

42:31.490 --> 42:35.911
Nothin' like real soap
to get that prison stench off you.

42:36.369 --> 42:38.705
You oughta try some.

42:41.666 --> 42:43.710
So, did you ask her?

42:43.835 --> 42:45.921
- Ask her what?
- You know.

42:46.838 --> 42:50.258
- No, I don't know.
- You don't remember? Scrub-a-dub-dub.

42:50.425 --> 42:52.636
- Go ahead. Go on, ask her.
- Ask me what?

42:52.844 --> 42:55.138
- Nothin'.
- You got nothin' to be ashamed of.

42:55.305 --> 42:57.307
That's right. I'm a grown man.

42:57.474 --> 43:00.977
All day long he's been talkin'
about wanting to take a bath

43:01.103 --> 43:03.271
with some Mr Bubble, the one kids love.

43:03.438 --> 43:06.316
- That's foul.
- I didn't know you were so sensitive.

43:06.858 --> 43:09.778
- You guys know each other before jail?
- No.

43:09.945 --> 43:12.781
- Became friends inside?
- We ain't friends.

43:13.406 --> 43:15.408
Cell mates?

43:19.120 --> 43:20.872
Just asking.

43:20.997 --> 43:23.542
Hey, where do you think you're goin'?

43:24.000 --> 43:28.588
You want your cut of the money?
Then I got some business to take care of.

43:28.755 --> 43:31.174
Now I got a plan.
You'll just have to trust me.

43:31.842 --> 43:33.885
Trust you?

43:34.052 --> 43:35.679
All right.

43:35.804 --> 43:40.058
See this? My daddy gave me this when
I was eight years old. I'm givin' it to you.

43:40.225 --> 43:43.311
You better make damn sure I get it back.
It's for good luck.

43:43.436 --> 43:46.064
You try to fuck me, I will find you.

43:57.492 --> 44:00.036
Santiago. Have your playmates arrived?

44:00.161 --> 44:02.831
- Yes, they have.
- Have you received my fax yet?

44:03.582 --> 44:07.794
- Yes, I have.
- The one fault that is universal to men

44:07.919 --> 44:09.963
is our love of women.

44:10.755 --> 44:14.092
Find her, and you'll find Luke Dodge.

44:14.926 --> 44:17.345
Just make sure you have the disk,

44:17.470 --> 44:20.890
or be certain no one else can get it
before you do away with Dodge.

44:21.891 --> 44:26.813
I find the girl, we get to Dodge,
and if he doesn't have the disk

44:26.938 --> 44:31.276
- we kill him.
- Si. In that order.

45:43.223 --> 45:46.643
- This place is the shit!
- Ray, this is bullshit.

45:46.851 --> 45:51.648
Why are you always complainin', man?
This is a nice place with nice women.

45:51.815 --> 45:55.026
This is a stink place
with some stink ho's. OK?

45:55.193 --> 45:58.738
And they cold too, man.
You can't even get next to 'em.

45:58.905 --> 46:01.116
Plus I get ass dust in my drink.

46:01.282 --> 46:05.495
Why they have to be ho's? Chill.
You gonna make the girl uncomfortable.

46:05.662 --> 46:08.456
- Fuck that bitch.
- You no-class motherfucker.

46:09.749 --> 46:12.544
Somebody put out the fire, please.

46:12.669 --> 46:17.632
Ladies and gentlemen, the Blue Flame
proudly welcomes to the stage...

46:17.757 --> 46:19.759
Faith!

46:56.880 --> 47:01.259
- Ray, we got to go.
- No, man. This is go-go night.

47:01.384 --> 47:04.037
No, this is a ho-ho night,
and we got to go.

47:04.137 --> 47:08.892
- What's wrong wit' you, man?
- These ho's all wanna be Madonna.

47:09.058 --> 47:13.229
They don't wanna stand next to the man.
They wanna stand in front of him.

47:13.438 --> 47:17.984
If they can, they'll knock your ass down.
Ain't that right, white boy?

47:18.610 --> 47:21.070
- Whitey?
- Hey, my man's talkin' to you.

47:22.155 --> 47:25.408
- No shit.
- No, that's serious shit.

47:26.701 --> 47:30.872
You know, I'm sittin' here
and I'm listenin' to you and I'm thinkin'...

47:30.997 --> 47:32.999
Thinkin' and listenin' to you.

47:34.417 --> 47:37.170
You're drinkin' and thinkin'.
What about?

47:37.587 --> 47:43.176
- I'm thinkin' that you're full of shit.
- He know you, Bo Grant.

47:43.760 --> 47:45.762
Now what'd you say?

47:45.928 --> 47:49.849
When a woman asserts herself,
starts callin' her own shots,

47:50.058 --> 47:53.144
a fella like you thinks
she's not a woman. That's a shame.

47:55.521 --> 47:57.106
Motherfucker, please!

47:57.440 --> 48:00.401
Look at this shit.
These trick-ass bitches? Come on, man.

48:00.526 --> 48:03.571
They don't give nothin'
but about their fuckin' dollar.

48:03.946 --> 48:06.741
Bullshit. And I'll prove it to you.

48:06.908 --> 48:09.160
How much you wanna bet
I can roll up there

48:09.327 --> 48:12.455
and lay a nice, long,
sweet, wet kiss on that girl?

48:12.622 --> 48:15.708
And it'll only take one of them roses.
You game?

48:16.125 --> 48:18.127
That is my game.

48:18.294 --> 48:21.172
- You think you got it like that?
- Oh, I think he do.

48:21.339 --> 48:23.883
Forget that. I bet you
$500 he can do it.

48:24.008 --> 48:27.637
Then I'm gonna take your $500
and give it to him just for doin' it!

48:27.845 --> 48:30.681
It's worth that much
to see you look like a asshole.

48:30.890 --> 48:32.850
What's up with this new shit?

48:33.226 --> 48:36.270
Why don't you kiss his ass?
You sidin' with him now?

48:36.437 --> 48:40.149
I ain't sidin' with nobody.
I'm down with anybody that's got heart.

48:40.274 --> 48:42.193
He's got heart. The question is,

48:42.318 --> 48:44.779
do you, my brother?

48:44.946 --> 48:47.073
Oh, yeah.

48:47.240 --> 48:49.450
Motherfucker, you on.

48:49.867 --> 48:52.286
And you're up.

48:52.662 --> 48:55.748
Opie, don't disappoint me, man.
I got money on you.

49:00.169 --> 49:02.213
I'm watchin' you, white boy.

49:05.967 --> 49:07.677
Yeah, come on, baby. Come on!

49:11.264 --> 49:13.808
Welcome home, Thug.

49:13.975 --> 49:15.726
Don't let me down.

49:19.897 --> 49:22.066
Hell, yeah! I told you he could do it.

49:22.233 --> 49:25.027
- Fuck that. They know each other.
- He don't know her.

49:25.194 --> 49:27.488
- He set me up.
- Ain't nobody set you up.

49:27.655 --> 49:29.740
Just shut up and give me this money.

49:29.949 --> 49:34.871
Just goes to show you
don't have to go to church to have Faith!

49:35.079 --> 49:39.292
Let's give a Blue Flame welcome to
Robin, Lark and Sparrow.

49:52.054 --> 49:54.015
Are you raiding my private files?

49:54.181 --> 49:57.310
I gotta get to Puffy.
Now's the time he's on the Pyramid Web.

49:57.476 --> 50:00.938
- Hasn't he caused enough trouble?
- Yes, but he'll get us out of it.

50:01.105 --> 50:03.274
- This is a guy thing, right?
- Right.

50:03.482 --> 50:06.027
- Nice tits.
- I agree.

50:06.736 --> 50:08.696
Knock it off.

50:11.741 --> 50:13.284
OK, here we go.

50:13.451 --> 50:16.746
- I knew he'd be up to no good.
- Puffy, no good: hand in hand.

50:17.079 --> 50:19.081
OK, here we go.

50:19.540 --> 50:21.542
What's up, Puffdawg?

50:23.336 --> 50:25.630
"You're out! How do I know it's you?"

50:26.047 --> 50:30.009
Do you want me to tell you
at what age you stopped wetting the bed?

50:30.134 --> 50:32.219
Jerk.

50:32.386 --> 50:36.432
"You do that and you won't get
the surprise I've got for you."

50:36.599 --> 50:38.601
Then we should meet.

50:40.811 --> 50:42.813
"Tonight at the witching hour."

50:42.980 --> 50:44.398
Where?

50:44.523 --> 50:47.318
"I've got a jonz in my bonz
and I need a fortune cookie"?

50:47.443 --> 50:52.156
It's our code. It means meet at midnight
at the Tokyo Massage Parlor.

50:52.365 --> 50:55.618
- He wants to meet at a massage parlour?
- So what?

50:55.743 --> 51:01.540
Baby, if it's a massage you're looking for,
why not let my fingers do the walking?

51:02.500 --> 51:06.837
- I couldn't wait to get you outta that club.
- I had to do something to pay my tuition.

51:07.505 --> 51:10.883
Besides, I like being independent
and taking care of myself.

51:11.050 --> 51:13.594
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna
take care of you now.

51:13.803 --> 51:16.097
So where do you wanna go?
Name your place.

51:16.639 --> 51:18.432
Dinner.

51:18.599 --> 51:20.559
Really?

51:21.644 --> 51:23.646
I got a better idea.

51:23.813 --> 51:26.607
Let's order room service
and stay right here.

51:41.038 --> 51:43.707
I guess this is it.

51:45.876 --> 51:48.129
You know where you're going?

51:48.337 --> 51:50.840
I'll play it by ear, see what happens.

51:51.549 --> 51:53.551
You know, I was thinking.

51:54.176 --> 51:58.222
Maybe once you figure out
where you're going, get settled,

51:58.389 --> 52:02.101
maybe you wanna drop me a postcard,
gimme a call.

52:03.853 --> 52:07.565
Well, how can I keep in touch with you?

52:12.027 --> 52:14.280
Here's my phone number and my address.

52:15.823 --> 52:17.741
I'd like to know you're OK.

52:21.495 --> 52:23.622
Wait. Here.

52:24.290 --> 52:27.334
I thought you might need this.

52:29.753 --> 52:32.047
Maybe you better keep it.

53:13.088 --> 53:15.090
Room service?

53:31.941 --> 53:34.401
No!

53:50.084 --> 53:51.627
Fuck you!

54:09.144 --> 54:14.400
You're probably dangling there wondering
how you got into this predicament.

54:17.152 --> 54:19.780
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

54:20.781 --> 54:23.826
- I want the disk.
- What disk?

54:31.542 --> 54:35.629
The disk that you used
to steal $25 million from my employer.

54:37.131 --> 54:40.134
- They would like it back.
- You didn't have to kill her.

54:42.678 --> 54:44.888
You're assuming I have a lot of time.

54:53.939 --> 54:55.315
I don't.

54:57.568 --> 54:59.570
Manny.

55:08.036 --> 55:12.207
New Orleans express
now boarding at gate number five.

56:07.554 --> 56:11.099
I'm on a schedule, Mr Dodge,
and I'm running out of time.

56:12.226 --> 56:15.354
Or should I say that
you're running out of time?

56:16.730 --> 56:19.983
- Ever hear of the Chinese death torture?
- You Chinese?

56:20.192 --> 56:24.780
No, I'm Cuban.
But I have a great affinity for all cultures.

56:24.947 --> 56:28.158
It's part of my mongrel upbringing
on the streets of New York.

56:28.367 --> 56:30.994
New York. That explains your hostility.

56:32.788 --> 56:36.959
The Chinese have developed a torture
known as "the death of a thousand cuts".

56:37.751 --> 56:41.046
We make a thousand tiny incisions
all over your body.

56:41.213 --> 56:44.675
Small cuts, paper cuts, but worse.

56:45.634 --> 56:48.762
- It's supposed to be very painful.
- No shit.

56:55.560 --> 56:59.481
You either tell me what I want to know,
or you're soon gonna find out.

57:01.483 --> 57:03.276
Where's the disk?

57:04.236 --> 57:06.238
Fuck you, Rico.

57:08.490 --> 57:09.992
Fuck me?

57:10.200 --> 57:12.703
No. Fuck you.

57:13.787 --> 57:15.455
Where's the disk?

58:07.591 --> 58:09.926
On your feet, convict.

58:10.635 --> 58:13.138
Come on, Dodge.
Pack your shit and let's go.

58:19.186 --> 58:22.230
Come on, Dodge. We gotta fled.

58:29.946 --> 58:33.074
- We gotta get those fucks.
- Not now.

58:33.241 --> 58:35.243
- They killed my girl!
- Listen up.

58:35.410 --> 58:39.039
Three things are important now -
your life, my life and the disk.

58:39.206 --> 58:41.833
- Now, who are those people?
- I don't know.

58:41.958 --> 58:43.960
The guy with the knife,
what did he want?

58:44.085 --> 58:47.672
- I don't know. Are you writin' a book?
- No, I'm a cop!

58:49.549 --> 58:53.428
I can't explain right now. I need to know
who these fuckin' people are.

58:57.224 --> 59:01.311
I got your attention now, convict?
These people are trying to kill you!

59:03.855 --> 59:05.857
We gotta get outta here.

59:06.024 --> 59:09.986
That means I need you to be with me
right here, right now. OK?

59:10.153 --> 59:12.155
Are you with me?

59:14.783 --> 59:16.785
Come on. Are you with me?

59:35.804 --> 59:37.889
Freeze!

59:41.184 --> 59:43.603
- If you're a cop, do something.
- Like what?

59:43.770 --> 59:45.313
I don't know. Some cop shit.

59:48.566 --> 59:50.568
Hold it.

59:52.737 --> 59:55.073
Hi. Thank you.

59:55.240 --> 59:58.576
Excuse me, miss!
Police business. We need your car.

59:58.743 --> 01:00:02.288
Oh, my God. RuPaul.
Girlfriend, I am such a fan!

01:00:02.414 --> 01:00:04.457
- Can we borrow your car?
- Sure. OK.

01:00:04.582 --> 01:00:07.085
- Thanks.
- Just don't bring it back on E, OK?

01:00:07.293 --> 01:00:09.254
You got it, baby.

01:00:09.713 --> 01:00:11.172
They were nice.

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.575
I oughta blow your head off!

01:00:13.675 --> 01:00:16.886
- Put that away before you hurt yourself.
- How'd you find me?

01:00:17.053 --> 01:00:19.639
You got my harmonica, convict?

01:00:20.265 --> 01:00:23.810
- It's a trackin' device.
- I can't believe you're a fuckin' cop.

01:00:24.269 --> 01:00:27.022
- You lied to me.
- I just didn't tell the whole truth.

01:00:27.647 --> 01:00:30.325
I was workin'
in New York's narcotics unit,

01:00:30.491 --> 01:00:32.986
that was under investigation
by Internal Affairs.

01:00:33.153 --> 01:00:35.864
Somebody fingered me.
I took a six-year hit.

01:00:35.989 --> 01:00:39.492
So when a fed named Schiller
made me an offer, I couldn't refuse.

01:00:39.659 --> 01:00:43.246
- What offer was that?
- I wasn't on that road by accident.

01:00:43.413 --> 01:00:47.792
The feds needed somebody to get you
to run, protect you, get you to the disk.

01:00:47.959 --> 01:00:50.128
If I do that, I walk.

01:00:50.253 --> 01:00:52.547
They killed those prisoners so I'd run?

01:00:52.714 --> 01:00:55.383
That wasn't supposed to happen.
It was a setup.

01:00:55.508 --> 01:00:59.637
They were supposed to use blanks, I run,
take you with me. Somethin' went wrong.

01:00:59.804 --> 01:01:02.348
- What the hell is on that disk?
- I don't know.

01:01:02.474 --> 01:01:05.769
Just stockholder information.
Accounting bullshit.

01:01:05.935 --> 01:01:08.605
I copied it all
so I can get into their system later.

01:01:08.772 --> 01:01:14.110
This company has hundreds of millions of
dollars. Some guy owns it - Mantajano.

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:15.612
- Mantajano?
- Yeah.

01:01:15.737 --> 01:01:17.739
- Frank Mantajano?
- Who the fuck is he?

01:01:17.864 --> 01:01:21.242
You stupid fuck. You stole $25 million
from the Cuban Mafia.

01:01:21.409 --> 01:01:26.122
Don't call me stupid, all right?
It's me that got us here in the first place.

01:01:26.289 --> 01:01:27.499
Shit!

01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:31.127
Hold on.

01:01:36.216 --> 01:01:39.219
- Why did they shoot at us?
- Maybe no one told 'em I was a cop.

01:01:46.184 --> 01:01:47.685
- Where's the disk?
- I don't know.

01:01:47.852 --> 01:01:49.729
- You don't know?
- Puffy hid it.

01:01:49.896 --> 01:01:52.565
- What the fuck is a puffy?
- I didn't mention Puffy?

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:54.859
- No, you didn't mention Puffy.
- Shit.

01:01:55.026 --> 01:01:59.405
Puffy's my friend. He hid the disk. We're
meeting at the Tokyo Massage Parlor.

01:01:59.531 --> 01:02:01.574
- If you can lose them.
- Hold on.

01:02:07.455 --> 01:02:09.457
- Shit!
- Hold on.

01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:54.836
Son of a bitch.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.383
Yes!

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.722
- Schiller?
- Yeah. You got me.

01:03:05.888 --> 01:03:07.724
What is going on?

01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:12.937
- We're close to resolving the situation.
- I ask you a question, I get fairy tales?

01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:17.275
- There have been minor setbacks but...
- But nothing.

01:03:17.442 --> 01:03:19.444
I'll be in Atlanta tomorrow morning.

01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:23.239
If you haven't got the disk for me,
you'll be wearing your ass for a hat.

01:03:23.406 --> 01:03:25.867
- Are we clear?
- Very clear, sir.

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:52.560
How you doin', Les?

01:03:52.727 --> 01:03:55.438
Not much money in bein' a detective
if you're honest.

01:03:55.605 --> 01:03:58.024
And you are honest.

01:04:03.654 --> 01:04:06.991
What'd you find out about Dodge
and the Attorney General?

01:04:07.158 --> 01:04:10.328
- Nothin'.
- Nothin'? Then what am I payin' you for?

01:04:10.495 --> 01:04:13.915
Because of what I know
about Dodge and Brigantine International.

01:04:14.457 --> 01:04:18.544
- I'm listenin'.
- The attorney from Brigantine called me

01:04:18.711 --> 01:04:21.881
and asked me to find out
about Dodge's friends.

01:04:22.048 --> 01:04:24.759
- For some nice change, of course.
- Of course.

01:04:25.259 --> 01:04:27.970
I did what I do, and I called him back

01:04:28.095 --> 01:04:31.140
with the name and number
of Dodge's girl Cindy

01:04:31.265 --> 01:04:33.684
and his best boy Puffy.

01:04:37.188 --> 01:04:39.440
Now you got what they got.

01:04:39.607 --> 01:04:42.985
All right, then, Les.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.322
Take care.

01:04:54.205 --> 01:04:56.207
Son of a bitch.

01:04:58.751 --> 01:05:01.629
I don't believe it.
Puffy's definitely here.

01:05:01.796 --> 01:05:04.423
- How do you know?
- Cos one of those bikes is mine.

01:05:04.632 --> 01:05:06.926
- Nice machines.
- You're damn right.

01:05:07.093 --> 01:05:10.930
The engine is an eight-valve,
liquid-cooled, desmo V-twin.

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:15.351
The tyres, Ducati Dragons.
Top speed, 180 mph.

01:05:16.102 --> 01:05:19.063
Best of all, it's got
an on-board computer.

01:05:19.188 --> 01:05:21.941
That's nice, Evel Knievel,
but let's get the disk.

01:05:22.108 --> 01:05:25.486
- That's why we're here, right?
- All right, all right.

01:05:25.861 --> 01:05:27.863
- By the way, what happened?
- What?

01:05:28.072 --> 01:05:30.741
- What took you so long?
- What are you talkin' about?

01:05:30.908 --> 01:05:33.661
Back at the hotel.
What took you so long to save me?

01:05:33.828 --> 01:05:36.247
Didn't you see "Shaft"?

01:06:02.273 --> 01:06:04.150
Dodge, my man!

01:06:04.317 --> 01:06:06.068
- What's up, baby?
- Puffdawg!

01:06:06.235 --> 01:06:09.655
I can't believe they let you out.
Come here. Gimme some love.

01:06:09.864 --> 01:06:11.615
It's good to see you, man.

01:06:11.824 --> 01:06:15.077
- Charles Piper, this is Puffy.
- How you doin'?

01:06:15.619 --> 01:06:18.289
See them bikes outside?
I got 'em for you, Dodge.

01:06:18.456 --> 01:06:20.458
Thanks, brother.

01:06:20.624 --> 01:06:22.376
It's good to see you.

01:06:22.543 --> 01:06:26.464
- I got something lined up for you two.
- We ain't got much time.

01:06:45.566 --> 01:06:46.525
Freeze!

01:06:59.747 --> 01:07:02.291
- Come on! Let's go.
- I'm not leavin' him here!

01:07:03.292 --> 01:07:04.251
Let's go!

01:08:06.063 --> 01:08:09.066
You're lucky it's just a flesh wound.

01:08:09.191 --> 01:08:12.987
I wish you had come to the house.
I would have done a much better job.

01:08:13.404 --> 01:08:16.240
I don't think
that would have been a good idea.

01:08:18.492 --> 01:08:20.703
You're a cop.

01:08:21.537 --> 01:08:23.581
How'd you know?

01:08:23.747 --> 01:08:26.332
When you live with one, you know.

01:08:28.419 --> 01:08:32.046
I can't tell you what's goin' on,
but you gotta be careful.

01:08:34.591 --> 01:08:37.970
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:50.316
- Do you mind?
- Excuse me.

01:08:58.948 --> 01:09:01.452
Excuse me, sir. More coffee?

01:09:02.578 --> 01:09:04.872
Yes, please.

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.517
You call Schiller
and tell him it's over.

01:09:25.684 --> 01:09:28.395
- It ain't over.
- I don't want the money any more.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.064
- Don't you understand?
- No, you don't understand.

01:09:31.231 --> 01:09:33.776
This thing is just gettin' started.

01:09:33.942 --> 01:09:36.403
I'm sorry about your girl
and your friend.

01:09:37.404 --> 01:09:40.073
I don't know what's on that disk
and I don't care.

01:09:40.198 --> 01:09:43.118
But it got 'em killed.
If we don't find it, we're dead.

01:09:43.702 --> 01:09:46.121
So you better start thinkin', convict.

01:09:52.877 --> 01:09:54.004
What?

01:09:57.049 --> 01:09:58.926
The bikes.

01:10:04.264 --> 01:10:06.016
What are you doing?

01:10:06.183 --> 01:10:09.853
I know these bikes better than computers.
Puffy knew that.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:14.733
- This better be good, Dodge.
- This motorcycle's a 916, not a 616.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.902
Big deal.

01:10:17.444 --> 01:10:19.488
Yes! Thank you, Puffy.

01:10:19.613 --> 01:10:22.866
- What have you got?
- It's a map of the Georgia Dome.

01:10:23.033 --> 01:10:25.702
- The Georgia Dome?
- When Puffy and I hung out,

01:10:25.828 --> 01:10:28.872
we'd meet in the utility room
at the Georgia Dome.

01:10:29.039 --> 01:10:32.876
- All right, let's go.
- Hold on. It's closed.

01:10:33.043 --> 01:10:37.422
- Let's get out of the rain and make a plan.
- I'll meet you in there.

01:10:38.382 --> 01:10:41.468
You're a fuck-up, Matthew. How do
you fuck up? Let me count the ways.

01:10:41.677 --> 01:10:46.140
Got innocent civilians shot. Interfered
with the Attorney General's investigation.

01:10:46.306 --> 01:10:49.393
- Scared off two fugitives.
- Would you hear me out?

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.270
No! I will not hear you out.

01:10:51.436 --> 01:10:54.273
- Even to hear about the Cuban hit men?
- Not our problem.

01:10:54.439 --> 01:10:56.984
Let the Attorney General's office
handle it.

01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:00.195
They're sending someone tomorrow.
Get lost till they're gone.

01:11:00.362 --> 01:11:04.783
- So what are you sayin'?
- I did you a favour and you let me down.

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:07.828
Now get the fuck outta here.
You're suspended.

01:11:45.657 --> 01:11:48.368
I want to thank you
for taking this meeting.

01:11:48.535 --> 01:11:50.537
I know you're a busy man.

01:11:52.039 --> 01:11:54.041
I think we want the same thing.

01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:57.878
This disk.

01:11:58.086 --> 01:12:00.088
It's become quite a problem, no?

01:12:03.175 --> 01:12:06.970
If the Attorney General
gets his hands on it, my life is over.

01:12:09.473 --> 01:12:11.475
What would happen

01:12:11.642 --> 01:12:14.936
if you got the disk and gave it to me?

01:12:17.105 --> 01:12:19.524
How would that change your life?

01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:25.822
I think that $2 million
would change your life just fine.

01:12:27.324 --> 01:12:29.493
Why don't you think about that?

01:12:30.619 --> 01:12:32.579
We'll talk.

01:12:42.214 --> 01:12:44.216
- Schiller.
- Charles Piper.

01:12:44.341 --> 01:12:46.385
Piper. Are you OK?

01:12:46.968 --> 01:12:48.970
- I'm fine.
- And Dodge?

01:12:49.096 --> 01:12:50.764
He's fine. We're both alive.

01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:53.517
I was worried
after that fiasco with the locals.

01:12:54.226 --> 01:12:57.604
- I couldn't tell them of your involvement.
- I understand.

01:12:57.771 --> 01:13:01.149
We're runnin' out of time here, Piper.
Do you have the disk?

01:13:01.316 --> 01:13:03.068
I believe I'll have it soon, sir.

01:13:03.276 --> 01:13:05.612
Tell me where you are
so I can bring you in.

01:13:06.071 --> 01:13:09.574
- I'm at the Georgia Dome. Meet me at...
- The food courts on level two.

01:13:09.741 --> 01:13:11.743
The food courts on level two.

01:13:13.161 --> 01:13:15.664
I'll meet you there in 20 minutes.

01:13:15.789 --> 01:13:17.749
Good job, Piper.

01:13:17.916 --> 01:13:19.918
Thank you, sir.

01:13:21.837 --> 01:13:24.005
- You got everything you need?
- Yes, I do.

01:13:24.172 --> 01:13:28.844
When it's over, meet us here. Dodge: pay
attention, stay close. Timing's everything.

01:13:28.969 --> 01:13:31.179
- Any questions?
- Let's do this.

01:13:35.058 --> 01:13:39.187
You've seen the sporty 125s.
Now it's time for the 250 main.

01:13:39.354 --> 01:13:45.443
We hope you are enjoying the action
here at the world-famous Georgia Dome.

01:13:46.778 --> 01:13:48.780
Emergency. Security!

01:13:48.947 --> 01:13:51.199
- Security. Help!
- What's your problem?

01:13:51.324 --> 01:13:53.368
She's pregnant.

01:13:53.535 --> 01:13:56.496
- What's she saying?
- She's gonna drop the baby any minute.

01:13:56.663 --> 01:14:00.625
- I gotta lay her down. Help me!
- Put her in the Security office.

01:14:09.759 --> 01:14:11.761
It's gonna be all right.

01:14:19.895 --> 01:14:22.314
- Where are we goin'?
- Level three.

01:14:38.997 --> 01:14:41.958
- What's all the commotion, fellas?
- Didn't you hear?

01:14:42.125 --> 01:14:44.544
Schiller said it's goin' down
at Georgia Dome.

01:14:44.711 --> 01:14:46.963
- With Dodge and Piper?
- Damn right.

01:14:49.174 --> 01:14:51.635
Now, who is Pedro?

01:14:51.801 --> 01:14:55.889
- Your husband? What is his last name?
- My husband's name?

01:14:57.599 --> 01:15:00.810
- What in blazes is goin' on?
- I think she's havin' a baby.

01:15:00.936 --> 01:15:02.520
Call the medic.

01:15:05.607 --> 01:15:07.442
Get the medic in here!

01:15:14.449 --> 01:15:18.036
Now let's call on the man
who's gonna call this race,

01:15:18.161 --> 01:15:21.331
- Matt Miller.
- Thanks, Arlin. Well, folks...

01:15:33.468 --> 01:15:36.221
I can't find
the employee concession binder, sir.

01:15:36.346 --> 01:15:39.099
Here. You just sit still.
I'll be right back.

01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:02.664
OK, we've got it.

01:16:04.541 --> 01:16:06.042
Where'd she go?

01:16:24.894 --> 01:16:26.354
And there they go.

01:16:36.573 --> 01:16:39.826
- How much further?
- It's just ahead.

01:18:42.907 --> 01:18:44.909
- You got it?
- Let's go.

01:20:13.664 --> 01:20:16.209
- Dodge!
- Gibson!

01:20:17.043 --> 01:20:18.961
It's a setup!

01:20:19.795 --> 01:20:20.922
Move.

01:20:38.064 --> 01:20:40.650
- Let me shoot!
- OK. On three. Point and squeeze.

01:20:40.816 --> 01:20:42.318
Ready? One, two, three.

01:21:00.169 --> 01:21:03.255
- Did I get him?
- Stay down! Come on.

01:21:21.941 --> 01:21:23.734
Get up! Let's go!

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.410
Let's go!

01:21:38.874 --> 01:21:41.669
Look out! Get down!

01:21:43.421 --> 01:21:44.422
Shit.

01:21:49.135 --> 01:21:50.136
Go!

01:21:56.392 --> 01:21:58.686
- Go!
- Drive!

01:22:17.538 --> 01:22:19.665
Get out of the way.

01:22:24.712 --> 01:22:27.673
- Slow down. Drive normally.
- What happened back there?

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.842
- We were sold out.
- What does that mean?

01:22:30.009 --> 01:22:32.303
The US marshal I dealt with sold us out.

01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:35.306
- I should've busted a cap in his ass.
- Yeah, right.

01:22:35.681 --> 01:22:39.769
- What the hell do we do now?
- We call the Attorney General's office.

01:22:40.686 --> 01:22:42.021
You get any information on him, call me.

01:22:42.188 --> 01:22:47.318
Matthew, you're like my ex-wife. You just
never go away. What are you doin' here?

01:22:47.485 --> 01:22:50.529
Schiller was playin' both sides
against the middle.

01:22:50.654 --> 01:22:53.532
He shot me. He was tryin'
to kill Dodge and Piper.

01:22:53.699 --> 01:22:55.701
Why would Schiller shoot you?

01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:59.497
Matthew Gibson, Christopher Paine -
with the Attorney General's office.

01:22:59.663 --> 01:23:04.210
You fellas appear to be havin'
a lot of internal problems over there.

01:23:04.335 --> 01:23:08.339
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talkin' about Schiller and Mantajano.

01:23:12.009 --> 01:23:14.512
- Paine.
- Charles Piper.

01:23:15.304 --> 01:23:17.640
Piper. Where are you?

01:23:17.765 --> 01:23:21.310
Where I am isn't important.
Where I'm going is, if you want the disk.

01:23:21.435 --> 01:23:23.437
- Where?
- Someplace safe.

01:23:23.562 --> 01:23:26.899
I'm not sure how many of your people
are renegades like Schiller.

01:23:27.483 --> 01:23:30.277
Yes. Officer Gibson just informed me.

01:23:30.486 --> 01:23:34.365
- Tell him I said thanks for the warning.
- I'll do that. Now, where and when?

01:23:34.531 --> 01:23:36.575
Let's talk about "what" first.

01:23:36.742 --> 01:23:39.620
I want complete exoneration
for Dodge and myself.

01:23:39.745 --> 01:23:42.122
- It's done.
- And I want my old job back.

01:23:42.248 --> 01:23:44.291
- Anything else?
- That'll do for now.

01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:46.085
We'll discuss it later.

01:23:46.252 --> 01:23:48.587
Meet me on top of Stone Mountain
in one hour.

01:23:48.796 --> 01:23:50.756
- You got it?
- I'll be there.

01:23:52.925 --> 01:23:54.885
We're going to Stone Mountain.

01:23:55.052 --> 01:23:57.054
And you're coming with us.

01:24:04.603 --> 01:24:06.647
I gotta stop falling for cops.

01:24:08.649 --> 01:24:12.319
- I'll be back.
- You promise?

01:24:17.157 --> 01:24:19.159
I promise.

01:24:29.586 --> 01:24:32.197
We'll find them.

01:24:32.297 --> 01:24:36.135
It shouldn't be too hard,
driving around in that pumpkin.

01:27:45.490 --> 01:27:51.621
Stone Mountain Park is a 3,200-acre
recreational and historic park,

01:27:51.788 --> 01:27:54.332
encompassing Stone Mountain.

01:27:54.458 --> 01:27:56.960
Stone Mountain
is a massive dome of granite

01:27:57.127 --> 01:28:00.172
rising 825 feet
above the surrounding plain.

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:04.676
The 300 million-year-old mountain
measures five miles in circumference

01:28:04.843 --> 01:28:07.679
and covers 583 acres.

01:28:10.974 --> 01:28:13.226
Here they come.

01:28:32.454 --> 01:28:35.332
- What the hell's goin' on?
- How should I know?

01:28:38.376 --> 01:28:41.671
- I thought they were meetin' us at the top.
- So did I.

01:28:42.839 --> 01:28:46.176
We are experiencing a temporary delay.

01:28:46.301 --> 01:28:50.514
We apologise for the inconvenience
but ask that you remain patient.

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:53.892
Service will be restored momentarily.

01:29:03.193 --> 01:29:06.112
- You're supposed to be dead.
- The miracle of Kevlar.

01:29:06.571 --> 01:29:09.324
- Give me the disk.
- He doesn't have it.

01:29:12.828 --> 01:29:16.373
- Give me the disk.
- Look, he told you. We don't have it.

01:29:17.332 --> 01:29:19.835
You don't have it?
Then we got a problem.

01:29:24.965 --> 01:29:28.677
Give me that disk or I'll start
tossing bodies out of this thing.

01:29:28.885 --> 01:29:30.845
- Starting with your friend.
- Wait!

01:29:34.182 --> 01:29:37.310
I'll give you the disk.
But then you gotta let him go.

01:29:39.145 --> 01:29:40.480
All right?

01:30:48.214 --> 01:30:49.674
Schiller!

01:30:52.218 --> 01:30:54.054
Time to pay the piper.

01:31:08.818 --> 01:31:12.864
The committee meets in the morning.
I gotta get back right away.

01:31:18.328 --> 01:31:20.622
- Charles Piper.
- Yeah!

01:31:21.498 --> 01:31:22.999
Christopher Paine.

01:31:23.708 --> 01:31:25.877
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, we're all right.

01:31:26.086 --> 01:31:27.962
- Where's the disk?
- Here.

01:31:28.171 --> 01:31:30.131
What did I copy onto this thing?

01:31:31.174 --> 01:31:33.343
We had an informant inside Brigantine.

01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:37.806
He leaked that you copied Mantajano's
money laundering, his finances.

01:31:37.972 --> 01:31:40.266
Everything we need to nail Mantajano.

01:31:40.934 --> 01:31:45.480
I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to
give it to someone I know I can trust.

01:31:48.942 --> 01:31:50.735
Thanks.

01:31:51.653 --> 01:31:53.988
All right, then, Dodge. All right, then.

01:31:54.405 --> 01:31:57.158
Look, I gotta get the disk
back to the committee.

01:31:57.325 --> 01:31:59.369
Oh, I spoke to the Governor of New York.

01:31:59.577 --> 01:32:02.121
- You'll get your old job back.
- Thanks.

01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:05.333
You're free to go. Both of you.

01:32:06.125 --> 01:32:08.336
Well, good work.

01:32:08.503 --> 01:32:10.713
Likewise.

01:32:11.631 --> 01:32:16.010
We need to ask you guys some questions
later. Meantime, get some rest.

01:32:16.135 --> 01:32:19.514
- There's a car waitin' for you.
- Thank you.

01:32:24.727 --> 01:32:26.729
About time to take that bath.

01:32:26.896 --> 01:32:29.440
What about your half of the money?

01:32:29.607 --> 01:32:32.952
- Forget about it.
- Come on, man. A deal's a deal.

01:32:33.119 --> 01:32:36.489
- Tryin' to bribe a police officer, convict?
- Now hold up.

01:32:37.448 --> 01:32:39.951
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

01:32:40.118 --> 01:32:42.203
Look, I got what I want. All right?

01:32:43.288 --> 01:32:45.290
We're even.

01:32:49.794 --> 01:32:51.796
Now we're even.

01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:59.971
Didn't you see
"What's Love Got To Do With It?"

01:33:01.931 --> 01:33:04.601
In the limo.
The scene with the boot when...

01:33:04.767 --> 01:33:06.311
What?

01:33:07.305 --> 01:33:13.251
