Help!

07:20.509 --> 07:21.342
Shit.

09:08.467 --> 09:11.634

09:23.507 --> 09:25.209
I tell you,

09:25.209 --> 09:27.718
I was absolutely livid.

09:27.718 --> 09:29.867
I genuinely hadn't the foggiest idea

09:29.867 --> 09:31.729
what had prompted Janine to scoop me up

09:31.729 --> 09:36.158
on to the bonnet and
catapult me into the Med.

09:36.158 --> 09:39.107
The only thing on my mind was
how to get back to my villa

11:03.724 --> 11:04.974
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

11:06.371 --> 11:07.204

11:11.359 --> 11:12.502
Trust me.

11:12.502 --> 11:13.851
It will look like an accident,

11:13.851 --> 11:16.592
and I've got everything in writing.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.531
It's like I said,

11:18.531 --> 11:21.060
it's not how wide you
open your legs, you know.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.971
It's how quickly you close them.

11:22.971 --> 11:24.163
That's all.

11:51.760 --> 11:56.260
- Eventually, I
find my way back to the road,

11:57.121 --> 12:00.204
burnt, broken and very nearly beaten.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.139

12:07.339 --> 12:08.839

12:50.241 --> 12:53.831
- Where the fuckin' hell are we now?

13:03.252 --> 13:05.351
- How the hell do I know?

13:05.351 --> 13:06.184
- Boys, who cares?

13:06.184 --> 13:08.020
We're gonna be busing
till we get to the beach.

13:08.020 --> 13:11.031
Then the party's gonna
start all over again, eh?

13:15.540 --> 13:16.373

13:16.373 --> 13:18.649
Honestly, you are fucking
doing my fucking head in!

Idiot!

13:34.514 --> 13:36.764
Look at this prick up here.

13:41.146 --> 13:42.146
- Oh my God.

13:43.987 --> 13:45.168
He's wearing a pink shirt,

13:45.168 --> 13:46.751
and he's waving us.

13:50.045 --> 13:51.016
Hey!

13:51.016 --> 13:51.849
Woo!

13:54.168 --> 13:55.536

Nice shirt!

14:05.075 --> 14:05.908
- God.

14:08.985 --> 14:10.318
- Idiot!

14:16.397 --> 14:17.230
- Twat.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.050
- This really wasn't my day.

14:57.896 --> 15:00.328
Little did I guess that
salvation would come

15:00.328 --> 15:03.245
in the guise of a Spanish Samaritan

15:04.288 --> 15:07.808
with a subtle philosophy
on the opposite sex.

15:07.808 --> 15:09.947
- What a bitch.

15:09.947 --> 15:13.256
- I need to get back to my villa.

15:13.256 --> 15:14.997
Can you take me to the town?

15:14.997 --> 15:15.830
- Yes.

15:21.357 --> 15:22.524
So this woman?

15:23.837 --> 15:25.048
- Janine.

15:25.048 --> 15:25.881
- Janine.

15:28.146 --> 15:30.926
And she never tried to kill you before?

15:30.926 --> 15:32.009
- Christ, no.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.906
No, absolutely not.

15:37.094 --> 15:40.594
- So you cheeky-cheeky with another woman?

15:41.444 --> 15:42.936
- No, of course not.

15:42.936 --> 15:44.269
She's my fiance.

15:45.172 --> 15:46.434
- Uh-huh.

15:46.434 --> 15:48.234
- We were out here
celebrating our engagement,

15:48.234 --> 15:50.362
for Christ's sake.

15:50.362 --> 15:52.112
- Uh-huh.

15:53.434 --> 15:54.762
- What do you mean, "Uh-huh?"

15:54.762 --> 15:56.664
- You ask her to be married?

15:56.664 --> 15:58.234
- Yes.

15:58.234 --> 16:00.484
- And you split everything?

16:02.074 --> 16:03.584
- What do you mean?

16:03.584 --> 16:06.642
- I mean, you divide by 50%,

16:06.642 --> 16:09.211
the house, money, cars?

16:09.211 --> 16:12.533
- Well, yeah, yes, of course, but,

16:12.533 --> 16:14.950
you've got to be kidding, no.

16:17.753 --> 16:18.992
Please, God, no.

16:36.722 --> 16:38.385
- Sounds crazy, no?

16:38.385 --> 16:40.416
- Of course, it is.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.456
Of course, it is.

16:42.456 --> 16:44.774
We've only been together six months.

16:44.774 --> 16:47.191
It's been wonderful, amazing,

16:48.894 --> 16:50.465
extraordinary.

17:07.665 --> 17:08.711
- But Darryl, you know,

17:08.711 --> 17:11.612
a woman isn't just one woman.

17:11.612 --> 17:12.779
They are many.

20:05.998 --> 20:07.667
It had taken the day from hell

20:07.667 --> 20:09.278
and a simple Spanish farmer

20:09.278 --> 20:13.195
to make me realise I was
in bed with the devil.

20:15.142 --> 20:17.664
But I wasn't prepared to roll over yet.

20:25.736 --> 20:26.653
Protection.

20:28.344 --> 20:29.177
Ah.

21:24.903 --> 21:28.232

21:28.232 --> 21:30.964
ready to give her a piece of my mind.

22:18.354 --> 22:20.687
Departing Seville, tomorrow?

22:22.364 --> 22:23.197
Cancun?

22:25.164 --> 22:27.164
She bloody planned this.

22:42.914 --> 22:44.895
While I was back at the villa,

22:44.895 --> 22:47.623
wondering how to get hold of my lawyer,

22:47.623 --> 22:49.873
Janine was out on the town.

23:29.851 --> 23:32.684
Where the hell are all my clothes?

23:34.083 --> 23:36.260
That's the last straw.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.593
She's binned my best slacks.

23:41.639 --> 23:43.889
I'm not wearing that shirt.

24:21.913 --> 24:24.879
She's taken my bloody car as well.

27:05.128 --> 27:06.179
Got to find a phone.

27:19.677 --> 27:21.262
Hola.

27:21.262 --> 27:22.095
- Hola.

27:23.119 --> 27:25.619
- One cerveza and one whiskey.

27:36.632 --> 27:39.022
Do you have a telephone?

27:39.022 --> 27:43.355
- No,.

27:44.707 --> 27:46.316
- Can I?

27:46.316 --> 27:47.149
Gracias.

27:53.716 --> 27:55.807
It's, it's not working, it isn't.

27:57.005 --> 27:59.287
England, England, Chester.

27:59.287 --> 28:01.247
- Oh England, it's not possible,

28:01.247 --> 28:03.106
not possible.

28:03.106 --> 28:06.773
- Gracias.

28:26.996 --> 28:27.829
- Whiskey.

28:56.124 --> 28:56.957
Cheers.

28:58.956 --> 28:59.789
- Cheers.

29:05.127 --> 29:06.210
- On holiday?

29:07.436 --> 29:08.269
- Kind of.

29:11.356 --> 29:13.445
- How I love the Med.

29:13.445 --> 29:14.862
I love the water.

29:18.778 --> 29:20.611
So you're on your own?

29:22.196 --> 29:23.113
- I am now.

29:26.836 --> 29:28.086
- Ah, I got ya.

29:29.195 --> 29:31.146
Holiday romance gone wrong, eh?

29:31.146 --> 29:32.177
What did you do,

29:32.177 --> 29:34.094
fuck one of the locals?

29:35.506 --> 29:38.396
Hell, mate, you can't beat a good woman.

29:38.396 --> 29:40.655
But you can certainly beat a bad one.

29:40.655 --> 29:42.738
- You can say that again.

29:43.906 --> 29:46.013
- So she get a bit close to the bone,

29:46.013 --> 29:48.327
this one of yours, eh?

29:48.327 --> 29:50.658
- Let's just say she
drove me close to the edge

29:50.658 --> 29:52.741
and leave it at that, eh.

29:54.287 --> 29:55.567
- Can't say I blame you, mate.

29:55.567 --> 29:57.316
Can't say I blame you.

29:57.316 --> 29:58.756
That Janine,

30:01.236 --> 30:04.903
she's a bloody tornado
of trouble, that one.

30:07.326 --> 30:08.909
- What did you say?

30:11.924 --> 30:13.757
What did you just say?

30:20.012 --> 30:22.929
How the hell do you know my fiance?

30:24.308 --> 30:25.795
- Janine?

30:25.795 --> 30:29.388
My kind of girl, takes it up the funnel,

30:29.388 --> 30:31.766
up the clacker, what a lady.

30:31.766 --> 30:33.796
- I beg your pardon.

30:33.796 --> 30:35.686
- Look, mate, you think
you're the only bloody idiot

30:35.686 --> 30:37.186
who got sucked in?

30:39.628 --> 30:41.845
I met her in Manila.

30:41.845 --> 30:43.217
It was love at first sight.

30:43.217 --> 30:45.471
Well, how could it not be.

30:45.471 --> 30:47.577
We decided to run a little dope

30:47.577 --> 30:51.435
across the border, you
know, a nice, easy 50K.

30:51.435 --> 30:52.436
- Drugs?

30:52.436 --> 30:55.519
- No, easy till we got bloody caught.

31:04.081 --> 31:05.831
Soon as it went down,

31:07.725 --> 31:09.058
good old Janine,

31:11.796 --> 31:15.228
she fingered me quicker than a typewrite.

31:15.228 --> 31:16.061
- Jesus.

31:17.478 --> 31:18.978
- She got the 50K.

31:20.614 --> 31:21.781
And I got five

31:25.433 --> 31:29.183
years.

31:47.773 --> 31:51.429
She offered to iron my shirt once.

32:14.088 --> 32:14.921
Oh I know.

32:17.188 --> 32:19.521
I know what you're thinking.

32:20.928 --> 32:22.956
Didn't see it coming!

32:22.956 --> 32:25.373
Did not bloody see it coming!

32:29.196 --> 32:30.363
Rik Le Salles.

32:31.268 --> 32:33.246
- Darryl Maddock.

32:33.246 --> 32:35.163
- Maddock, strong name.

32:38.154 --> 32:41.213
So how much she take you for, Darryl?

32:41.213 --> 32:42.828
- A villa here,

32:42.828 --> 32:44.490
my flat in Fulham,

32:44.490 --> 32:45.740
a Jeep, my BMW,

32:47.660 --> 32:50.191
the money in our joint account,

32:50.191 --> 32:51.700
my city bonus

32:51.700 --> 32:54.617
and a 2003 Pagani Zonda F Roadster.

32:57.730 --> 32:58.563
- Is that with

32:58.563 --> 33:01.164
or without the reinforced
chrome aluminum-alloy roll bar?

33:01.164 --> 33:03.535
- What do you think?

33:03.535 --> 33:04.674
- You cunt!

33:04.674 --> 33:06.074
- Me?

33:06.074 --> 33:07.991
Jesus, you know Janine.

33:10.633 --> 33:14.343
- Look, mate, she takes away
the things you can't replace,

33:14.343 --> 33:17.593
your dignity, your manhood, your pride.

33:21.503 --> 33:22.874
And if there's money involved, mate,

33:22.874 --> 33:25.791
she'd butt-fuck the Pope, that one.

33:27.210 --> 33:30.404
Yeah, there's only one thing to do

33:30.404 --> 33:32.953
with a girl like that, mate.

33:32.953 --> 33:34.383
- I know.

33:34.383 --> 33:36.084
I know, I'm planning something.

33:36.084 --> 33:37.683
- What are you planning?

33:37.683 --> 33:39.372
- Well, I've tried to
get a hold of my lawyer.

33:39.372 --> 33:41.163
I'm gonna sort something out.

33:41.163 --> 33:41.996
- Okay.

33:43.261 --> 33:47.011
Let's allow ourselves
a little fantasy, yeah.

33:49.634 --> 33:53.217
What would you like to
do to her right now?

33:56.287 --> 33:58.870
- Probably bloody strangle her.

34:00.251 --> 34:01.501
- Strangle her?

34:05.172 --> 34:07.135
Strangle her, you can't strangle her.

34:07.135 --> 34:09.081
It'd take at least 10 minutes.

34:09.081 --> 34:10.409
Ah, she'd be kickin' and screamin'

34:10.409 --> 34:11.442
and clawin' at your eyes,

34:11.442 --> 34:13.594
bitin' your hand, kickin' your nuts.

34:13.594 --> 34:16.012
You can't strangle her, mate.

34:17.349 --> 34:19.378
Now slicing her jugular,

34:19.378 --> 34:21.005
that's one way,

34:21.005 --> 34:24.338
45-degree angle, ear-to-ear, fwit!

34:24.338 --> 34:26.167
She'll piss out
three-and-a-half litres of blood

34:26.167 --> 34:27.667
in under a minute.

34:29.302 --> 34:30.260
Mind you, the only problem

34:30.260 --> 34:32.362
with that is there'll be blood everywhere.

34:32.362 --> 34:35.043
A damned mess, you'd
need a change of clothes,

34:35.043 --> 34:35.877
damned good mop.

34:35.877 --> 34:36.710
- That's absurd.

34:36.710 --> 34:40.043
Of course, I'm not gonna cut her throat.

34:41.262 --> 34:45.033
- You could always pierce
her through the temple

34:45.033 --> 34:46.533
with one of these.

34:52.851 --> 34:55.262
Perforates the occipital
and parietal lobes.

34:55.262 --> 34:57.130
Her eyes'll roll, brain dysfunctions.

34:57.130 --> 34:59.153
She's a goner, mate.

34:59.153 --> 35:02.653
Now the only thing with that, positioning.

35:04.461 --> 35:05.841
It's damned hard unless they're asleep

35:05.841 --> 35:06.862
or in a neck lock.

35:06.862 --> 35:10.591
- What the fuck are you talking about?

35:10.591 --> 35:11.424
- Or,

35:14.171 --> 35:17.754
you could just do it
the old-fashioned way.

35:19.409 --> 35:20.826
- Jesus.

35:22.950 --> 35:24.521
- Nine feet away, you hear?

35:24.521 --> 35:25.737
As long as it's a headshot,

35:25.737 --> 35:27.849
job's a good'un.

35:27.849 --> 35:30.182
But always, always remember,

35:32.590 --> 35:34.499
retrieve the bullet,

35:34.499 --> 35:39.499
even if it means scooping
out the brain with a spoon.

35:39.579 --> 35:41.121
DNA.

35:41.121 --> 35:42.121
- Oh my God.

35:43.281 --> 35:45.614
What do you do for a living?

35:59.318 --> 36:00.901
This is ridiculous.

36:02.182 --> 36:03.521
I couldn't shoot her through the head,

36:03.521 --> 36:04.938
and with a spoon!

36:07.507 --> 36:09.547
- Of course, you could, Darryl.

36:09.547 --> 36:10.797
It's dead easy.

36:13.798 --> 36:14.631
Mate,

36:18.097 --> 36:19.680
I'll do it for you.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.646
Fuck me, the bitch has got it coming.

36:22.646 --> 36:25.479
She left me high and dry, and you,

36:27.364 --> 36:28.364
look at you.

36:31.706 --> 36:32.539
Nah.

36:33.875 --> 36:36.747
You keep your hands clean, mate.

36:36.747 --> 36:38.747
This will be a pleasure.

36:42.606 --> 36:43.689
You know, uh,

36:45.086 --> 36:48.707
before I'm gonna do
your dirty work for you,

36:48.707 --> 36:52.297
how 'bout a slice of that
city bonus of yours, eh?

36:52.297 --> 36:53.214
Say, 50-50?

37:00.558 --> 37:01.391
- 20,000.

37:08.276 --> 37:11.776
- I could get to like you, Darryl Maddock.

37:17.838 --> 37:19.671
Just leave the bottle.

37:30.249 --> 37:34.531
Now where the bloody hell
did you get that shirt?

37:34.531 --> 37:35.789
- Manila.

37:46.788 --> 37:48.547
By the early hours of the morning,

37:48.547 --> 37:53.214
the Australian psychopath had
become my new best friend.

37:58.512 --> 38:01.219
So how old were you when
you killed your first man?

38:01.219 --> 38:02.141
- 12.

38:02.141 --> 38:03.602
- 12?

38:03.602 --> 38:06.050
- Bastard had it coming.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.878
He was my dad.

38:07.878 --> 38:09.507
- Your dad?

38:09.507 --> 38:10.340
Shit.

38:14.637 --> 38:15.918
Where the hell are we going?

38:15.918 --> 38:16.835
- Shortcut.

38:53.899 --> 38:56.760
- How the hell do you know
your way around this place?

38:56.760 --> 38:58.760
- Timor, night training.

39:04.347 --> 39:06.514
Come on, Darryl, this way.

39:10.210 --> 39:12.543
- I need help here, hot dog.

39:22.299 --> 39:25.111
Rik, what are we gonna do with the body?

39:25.111 --> 39:26.028
- The body?

39:28.020 --> 39:30.972
How the bloody hell should I know?

39:30.972 --> 39:35.234
- I'm not so sure
this is such a good idea.

39:35.234 --> 39:37.344
- Trust me, you're
gonna feel stacks better

39:37.344 --> 39:38.546
when the bitch is dead.

39:53.790 --> 39:55.867
Darryl, the lights are on.

39:55.867 --> 40:00.034
Blimey O'Reilly, we're in
luck here tonight, mate.

40:00.918 --> 40:04.251
- Rik, you know back in Manila,

40:05.839 --> 40:07.820
if you loved her as much as I do,

40:07.820 --> 40:10.089
why didn't you forgive her?

40:10.089 --> 40:11.256
- Forgive her?

40:12.580 --> 40:14.804
I look like a bloody idiot?

40:30.215 --> 40:31.082
It wouldn't surprise me

40:31.082 --> 40:33.693
if she's got another bloke in tow.

40:33.693 --> 40:35.469
- What, already?

40:35.469 --> 40:38.030
- She's faster than a
king cobra, that one,

40:38.030 --> 40:40.962
especially when there's men involved.

40:56.693 --> 41:00.309
My guess, she likes to spread that thing.

41:00.309 --> 41:01.280
- Exactly.

41:12.549 --> 41:14.400
Sorry to piss on your barbie, mate,

41:14.400 --> 41:16.900
but I'll sort this out myself.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.543
This is my revenge.

41:29.996 --> 41:33.189
Investment funds and derivatives
had hardly prepared me

41:33.189 --> 41:35.939
for a cold-blooded assassination.

41:44.397 --> 41:47.498
What am I gonna do with the body?

41:47.498 --> 41:49.189
I could throw it off a cliff.

41:53.020 --> 41:55.270
Aim for the head, headshot.

41:56.330 --> 41:57.199
Aim for the head.

42:12.559 --> 42:15.809
Always remember to retrieve the bullet.

44:50.302 --> 44:52.056
- Darryl, what are you doing here?

44:52.056 --> 44:53.337
- Good question, Janine!

44:53.337 --> 44:54.878
Good bloody question!

44:59.787 --> 45:02.409
- Darryl, let go of me!

45:04.939 --> 45:06.689
Don't be a creep!

45:15.281 --> 45:16.779
Hey, hey!

45:22.560 --> 45:24.251
Darryl, you've gone mad!

45:24.251 --> 45:25.531
- I've gone mad?

45:25.531 --> 45:29.364
I've gone mad?

45:52.379 --> 45:55.159
Come here, you little cow!

46:00.810 --> 46:01.643
Janine!

46:02.627 --> 46:03.460
Janine!

46:05.018 --> 46:07.268
Janine, open this door now!

46:09.748 --> 46:12.338
- Darryl, it was an accident.

46:12.338 --> 46:13.776
The car got stuck in gear.

46:13.776 --> 46:15.586
It wouldn't stop, baby.

46:15.586 --> 46:18.005
I tried to brake, but
the clutch was jammed.

46:18.005 --> 46:20.090
- You drove me off a bloody cliff.

46:20.090 --> 46:22.267
- Oh come on, I didn't mean to.

46:22.267 --> 46:23.748
- Thought it was an easy touch, did you?

46:23.748 --> 46:25.816
- Thank God you're alive.

46:25.816 --> 46:27.604
- Six months of calculated bliss,

46:27.604 --> 46:29.214
then wham-o, check please!

46:29.214 --> 46:30.296
- I swear that's not true.

46:30.296 --> 46:31.434
You know me.

46:31.434 --> 46:33.136
I'm not like that, baby.

46:33.136 --> 46:34.514
- You lying, fucking bitch!

46:34.514 --> 46:36.376
If you've touched one penny of mine,

46:36.376 --> 46:38.357
I'm gonna kill you here and now.

46:38.357 --> 46:40.336
- Darryl, we both know that's not true.

46:40.336 --> 46:42.077
Your ego is getting the better of you now.

46:42.077 --> 46:42.910
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

46:42.910 --> 46:45.866
- Well, you're is in for
a bloody reality check.

46:45.866 --> 46:47.646
- Darryl, I'm warning you.

46:47.646 --> 46:48.646
I've got PMT

46:52.084 --> 46:52.917
and a gun.

46:54.456 --> 46:55.289
- Shit!

46:56.307 --> 46:59.915
♪ Here we go, here we go ♪

46:59.915 --> 47:03.690
♪ Five months, two weeks, two days ♪

47:03.690 --> 47:04.750
♪ I'm about to lose my mind ♪

47:04.750 --> 47:05.843
♪ If you see my baby ♪

47:07.480 --> 47:08.313
- Shit.

47:15.038 --> 47:15.871
Shit.

47:17.870 --> 47:20.453
Two can play that game, Janine.

47:27.949 --> 47:29.032
Remember Rik?

47:36.651 --> 47:38.818
He wants to kill you, too.

47:42.272 --> 47:45.862
His grudge is nearly as big as mine.

47:45.862 --> 47:48.112
Something to do with a little drugs deal

47:48.112 --> 47:51.862
and five years he spent
in a Filipino prison.

47:53.254 --> 47:57.921
I wonder how many men have
slipped into your little net.

48:01.403 --> 48:03.631
Well, I can tell you one thing.

48:05.272 --> 48:07.504
There won't be another.

48:08.534 --> 48:09.961
- Darryl, Darryl!
- Oh!

48:09.961 --> 48:10.994
Ow, that hurt.
- Listen to me.

48:10.994 --> 48:11.827
- No!
- Listen to me.

48:11.827 --> 48:13.760
- Get off me!
- Darryl, Darryl!

48:13.760 --> 48:14.643
Hey, hey!
- Get off me!

48:14.643 --> 48:15.842
- Listen to me.

48:15.842 --> 48:17.751
Listen to me!

48:17.751 --> 48:19.026
Hey!

48:19.026 --> 48:19.859
- Get off me!
- Give me just five--

48:20.692 --> 48:21.572
Come on!

48:21.572 --> 48:22.806
Give me just five minutes,

48:22.806 --> 48:23.840
and I will explain all.

48:23.840 --> 48:24.740
I promise you.

48:24.740 --> 48:25.725
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

48:25.725 --> 48:27.286
It was just into the sea.

48:27.286 --> 48:28.696
It wasn't that bad.

48:28.696 --> 48:29.529
- Who do you think I am?

48:29.529 --> 48:31.096
Evel bloody Knievel?

48:31.096 --> 48:32.206
- I knew you'd live.

48:32.206 --> 48:33.526
It wasn't that high, baby.

48:33.526 --> 48:34.843
- No.
- It.

48:34.843 --> 48:36.090
- You might be able to sweet talk

48:36.090 --> 48:37.473
some deranged Australian,

48:37.473 --> 48:38.633
but I'm not falling for it.

48:38.633 --> 48:40.209
- No, baby, it's not like that.

48:40.209 --> 48:41.042
- Or maybe I did.

48:41.042 --> 48:43.651
- Baby, baby, okay, okay, shh.

48:44.484 --> 48:45.693
Baby, it's not like that.

48:45.693 --> 48:47.494
I was just playing with you.

48:47.494 --> 48:48.505
It was just a game.

48:48.505 --> 48:49.794
- Oh, a game?
- Yeah.

48:49.794 --> 48:50.923
- What fun, Janine.

48:50.923 --> 48:51.756
Who's up for a round

48:51.756 --> 48:53.412
of throwing Darryl off a fucking cliff?

48:53.412 --> 48:54.732
- Baby, look at me.

48:54.732 --> 48:56.565
Just look at me, baby.

48:58.092 --> 49:00.223
I've got stronger feelings for you

49:00.223 --> 49:02.531
than anybody else I've ever been with.

49:02.531 --> 49:04.492
- I pity the poor
bastards you didn't like.

49:04.492 --> 49:08.054
- Exactly, because I did
not like any of them,

49:08.054 --> 49:10.221
except you, darling, baby.

49:13.146 --> 49:17.084
It was the best six months of my life.

49:17.084 --> 49:19.463
- Well, you've got a
funny way of showing it.

49:22.074 --> 49:25.132
- And the best sex I ever had.

49:25.132 --> 49:26.732
- No!

49:36.287 --> 49:37.976
- Hey, baby.

49:37.976 --> 49:38.809
How does that feel,

49:38.809 --> 49:40.194
to be in complete control again?

49:40.194 --> 49:41.527
- Shut up, Janine!

49:41.527 --> 49:42.395
You're mad.

49:42.395 --> 49:43.385
- Yeah, I'm mad.

49:43.385 --> 49:45.236
I'm mad for you!

49:45.236 --> 49:46.069
If you wanted to kill me,

49:46.069 --> 49:47.604
you could do it just now.

49:47.604 --> 49:48.775
Just shoot me.

49:48.775 --> 49:49.986
Take the gun and shoot me.

49:49.986 --> 49:50.819
- You're a psychopath.

49:50.819 --> 49:52.264
- No, no, no, no, no,

49:52.264 --> 49:54.284
I'm just, um, hmm,

49:54.284 --> 49:55.935
a little high-maintenance.

49:55.935 --> 49:57.106
That's all, baby.
- Shut up, Janine!

49:57.106 --> 49:58.471
Just shut up!

49:58.471 --> 50:00.074
You can't turn this around, Janine.

50:00.074 --> 50:01.626
- Baby,

50:01.626 --> 50:03.194
baby, look at me.

50:03.194 --> 50:04.354
I'm not evil.

50:04.354 --> 50:06.437
I'm just difficult, okay.

50:07.863 --> 50:09.986
I just need excitement.

50:09.986 --> 50:11.826
Isn't it better to have someone

50:11.826 --> 50:13.615
who is a little bit dangerous

50:13.615 --> 50:15.293
than someone that sits at home all day

50:15.293 --> 50:17.370
and washes your socks?

50:17.370 --> 50:18.974
- I'm warning you, Janine,

50:18.974 --> 50:20.324
any more tricks,

50:20.324 --> 50:22.175
and I'm gonna be scraping this bullet out

50:22.175 --> 50:24.425
of your brain with a spoon.

50:25.514 --> 50:26.922
- With a spoon.

50:26.922 --> 50:28.764
Baby, okay, okay, okay,

50:28.764 --> 50:30.863
okay, you're right, okay.

50:30.863 --> 50:32.746
I was blinded by your money,

50:32.746 --> 50:33.684
what it can do.

50:33.684 --> 50:35.674
I'm weak like that.

50:35.674 --> 50:38.743
I'm a sucker for spas, shopping, shoes.

50:38.743 --> 50:40.962
- You might have screwed over
dozens of guys before me,

50:40.962 --> 50:43.972
but you've met your match with me.

50:43.972 --> 50:45.305
- Exactly, baby,

50:46.226 --> 50:48.164
and that's why you're,

50:48.164 --> 50:50.815
you're the closest one to my heart, baby.

50:50.815 --> 50:54.122
And you've just proved it, you know.

50:54.122 --> 50:55.714
You've got everything,

50:55.714 --> 50:57.964
everything I need in a man.

50:58.975 --> 51:01.153
You've got the intelligence,

the brain and the...

53:01.184 --> 53:03.017
in one tsunami of sex.

53:09.262 --> 53:12.121
My clothes were out of the bin,

53:12.121 --> 53:14.862
my car back in the drive,

53:14.862 --> 53:17.112
and the engagement back on.

53:19.472 --> 53:22.139
Normal service had been resumed.

54:42.132 --> 54:43.359
Heaven.

54:47.759 --> 54:49.486
What's going on?

54:49.486 --> 54:50.319

57:59.855 --> 58:00.688
Oh my God.

58:01.975 --> 58:04.444
- Rookie mistake, mate,
trying to kill a bloke

58:04.444 --> 58:06.944
with the flat edge of a spade.

58:08.394 --> 58:10.466
- I didn't mean to hurt you.

58:10.466 --> 58:14.814
- You need to use the
sharp edge, 45 degrees.

58:14.814 --> 58:18.231
Too much surface area with the flat edge.

58:20.564 --> 58:21.981
Slows the impact.

58:24.334 --> 58:25.667
Schoolboy error.

58:27.278 --> 58:29.945
- Rik, I don't know what to say.

58:31.358 --> 58:34.260
- Water under the bridge, mate,

58:34.260 --> 58:36.177
water under the bridge.

58:37.798 --> 58:41.220
I'd have done the same thing myself.

58:41.220 --> 58:42.969
You wanted to go it alone.

58:42.969 --> 58:44.552
I can see that now.

58:49.397 --> 58:50.314
- I really,

58:52.068 --> 58:54.568
I really thought she loved me.

58:59.457 --> 59:01.790
- Of course you did, Darryl.

59:03.868 --> 59:05.368
Of course you did.

59:06.497 --> 59:09.598
She fucked us both, didn't she?

59:09.598 --> 59:10.737
- Shit!

59:10.737 --> 59:12.570
Where the hell is she?

59:13.929 --> 59:15.801
- Flown the coop, mate,

59:15.801 --> 59:17.218
five minutes ago.

59:18.288 --> 59:19.977
I'd have shot her from the undergrowth,

59:19.977 --> 59:22.727
if you didn't nick my bloody gun.

59:24.868 --> 59:26.489
I reckon if we get there right now--

59:26.489 --> 59:28.858
- Jesus, Rik, we've
got to get you to a doctor.

59:28.858 --> 59:31.525
- Nah, I don't do doctors, mate.

59:33.249 --> 59:35.166
Drug fiends and alkies.

59:38.110 --> 59:39.430
Now here's the plan.

59:39.430 --> 59:40.263
- Plan?

59:41.150 --> 59:43.718
This has gone far enough.

59:43.718 --> 59:45.729
She's thrown me off a cliff,

59:45.729 --> 59:46.758
beaten me to a pulp,

59:46.758 --> 59:48.477
drowned in the pool.

59:48.477 --> 59:49.477
I've had it.

59:50.329 --> 59:51.412
I'm finished.

59:53.699 --> 59:55.918
- I hear you, Darryl.

59:55.918 --> 59:57.335
I hear you, mate.

01:00:01.788 --> 01:00:03.871
Now listen to me, Darryl.

01:00:04.988 --> 01:00:05.821
Focus.

01:00:12.628 --> 01:00:13.461
Shit!

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.617
My toes are going numb.

01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:20.710
Darryl.

01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:23.235
Shit.

01:00:23.235 --> 01:00:24.068
Darryl!

01:00:25.728 --> 01:00:26.561
Darryl!

01:00:31.059 --> 01:00:33.642
Transfer me to that Jeep, ASAP.

01:00:35.408 --> 01:00:36.908
I know a shortcut.

01:00:38.037 --> 01:00:42.339
You drive like a demon, mate.

01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:43.672
By my reckoning,

01:00:44.737 --> 01:00:48.006
we can head her off about a mile or two

01:00:48.006 --> 01:00:50.009
before the airport.

01:00:57.438 --> 01:01:00.629
- What are we gonna do if we catch her?

01:01:00.629 --> 01:01:03.546
- I'll think of something en route.

01:01:05.169 --> 01:01:08.409
I'm always best when I'm on my feet.

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:41.934
- I'm telling you,

01:01:41.934 --> 01:01:46.826
I had Rik down as some crass,
kangaroo-shagging psychopath.

01:01:46.826 --> 01:01:48.517
But you know what?

01:01:48.517 --> 01:01:50.237
If it wasn't for him,

01:01:50.237 --> 01:01:52.296
I would've literally drawn my last breath

01:01:52.296 --> 01:01:53.536
right there in the pool.

01:01:55.496 --> 01:01:58.037
This fucker had more
compassion in his cowboy boots

01:01:58.037 --> 01:02:01.370
than most people I had ever encountered.

01:02:02.355 --> 01:02:07.003
All I've done for the last
seven years is wear a suit,

01:02:07.003 --> 01:02:10.944
talk shit and crunch numbers.

01:02:10.944 --> 01:02:13.525
- But you made a lot of money, Darryl.

01:02:13.525 --> 01:02:16.025
And you're still a good bloke.

01:02:17.365 --> 01:02:19.822
You should be proud of yourself.

01:02:19.822 --> 01:02:21.655
- Yeah, nice and rich.

01:02:22.584 --> 01:02:24.544
And look where that's got me.

01:02:24.544 --> 01:02:28.461
- You're moving from
doubt to denial, textbook.

01:02:33.287 --> 01:02:35.237
- Aren't you scared, Rik?

01:02:35.237 --> 01:02:36.070
- Scared?

01:02:38.096 --> 01:02:40.688
I can't feel fear, mate.

01:02:40.688 --> 01:02:41.771
It's medical.

01:02:53.156 --> 01:02:55.674
- I think I've always been scared,

01:02:55.674 --> 01:02:59.007
scared of failing, scared of succeeding,

01:02:59.895 --> 01:03:01.414
scared of letting people down,

01:03:01.414 --> 01:03:06.414
scared of losing, scared of
falling in love, everything.

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:09.295
And now all of a sudden, from nowhere,

01:03:09.295 --> 01:03:12.743
when some really scary
shit is actually happening,

01:03:12.743 --> 01:03:14.410
that fear is fading.

01:03:15.273 --> 01:03:17.114
- Now you listen to me, Darryl Maddock,

01:03:17.114 --> 01:03:18.781
and you listen good.

01:03:20.874 --> 01:03:22.722
When I was a kid,

01:03:22.722 --> 01:03:25.555
I had a moment with a brown snake.

01:03:29.153 --> 01:03:30.736
We were eye-to-eye.

01:03:32.154 --> 01:03:34.921
They were the longest
three seconds of my life.

01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:36.433
The fucker went for me.

01:03:36.433 --> 01:03:41.431
I bit through his neck like
a bloody piece of licorice.

01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:43.348
And that was my moment.

01:03:47.313 --> 01:03:48.932
- Yeah.

01:03:48.932 --> 01:03:51.015
Janine is my brown snake.

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:55.262
I just want to kill this fucking girl

01:03:55.262 --> 01:03:56.520
and get it over with.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.187
- Ah, that's the spirit, Darryl.

01:04:00.959 --> 01:04:02.270
That's the spirit.

01:04:33.853 --> 01:04:36.186
Darryl, what's this feeling?

01:05:58.633 --> 01:05:59.466
- Shit.

01:06:16.553 --> 01:06:17.669
- No, no, no!

01:06:18.592 --> 01:06:21.461
Come on, don't do this to me now.

01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:22.294
Come on.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.513
Come on!

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.752
Come on, come on.

01:06:33.752 --> 01:06:34.669
- Rik, Rik!

01:06:37.141 --> 01:06:38.058
We got her.

01:06:39.358 --> 01:06:43.025
We're gonna go down
there and ram the bitch.

01:06:53.693 --> 01:06:56.626
- Where is a bloody man when you need one?

01:06:56.626 --> 01:06:57.459
Shit.

01:07:06.159 --> 01:07:06.992
Darryl?

01:07:08.005 --> 01:07:08.922
- Rik, Rik!

01:07:10.829 --> 01:07:11.912
Wake up, Rik!

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.418
Wake up!

01:07:14.418 --> 01:07:15.251
Rik?

01:07:16.178 --> 01:07:17.178
Rik!

01:07:17.178 --> 01:07:20.845
Rik, wake up!

01:07:34.795 --> 01:07:36.018
Rik, please.

01:07:36.018 --> 01:07:38.446
No, for Christ's sake, don't die, please.

01:07:38.446 --> 01:07:39.529
Rik, Rik, no.

01:07:41.465 --> 01:07:43.396
Please, for God's sake, don't die.

01:07:43.396 --> 01:07:44.313
I need you.

01:07:47.408 --> 01:07:48.241
- Come on!

01:07:56.804 --> 01:07:59.936
- No.

01:08:03.205 --> 01:08:04.038
Please!

01:08:08.881 --> 01:08:12.284
Come on, I can't do this without you.

01:08:12.284 --> 01:08:13.117
Oh please!

01:08:15.684 --> 01:08:16.517
No, no.

01:08:17.964 --> 01:08:18.796
- Come on.

01:08:20.988 --> 01:08:22.406
Come on, come on!

01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:39.772
- It sounds strange.

01:08:39.772 --> 01:08:42.761
But it felt like all
our fates were sealed,

01:08:42.761 --> 01:08:44.349
right there in the valley.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.740
- That's the spirit, Darryl.

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.881
That's the spirit.

01:09:03.732 --> 01:09:05.231
- Shit.

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.102
- Shit.

01:09:18.957 --> 01:09:21.290
I don't bloody believe this.

What are you trying to do?

01:09:31.598 --> 01:09:32.796
- Huh?

01:09:32.796 --> 01:09:34.129
- What the hell?

01:09:39.255 --> 01:09:40.796
Isn't throwing me off a cliff

01:09:40.796 --> 01:09:43.175
and drowning me not enough?

01:09:43.175 --> 01:09:44.854
What about him?

01:09:44.854 --> 01:09:46.484
Not happy with that?

01:09:46.484 --> 01:09:48.716
That's not enough.

01:09:48.716 --> 01:09:50.866

01:11:39.276 --> 01:11:40.359
- No, Darryl.

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:44.239
We can talk about this, baby.

01:11:44.239 --> 01:11:46.393
We had great communication so far.

01:11:49.382 --> 01:11:51.222

amicable, baby.

01:11:52.644 --> 01:11:54.462
- I don't understand the word.

01:11:54.462 --> 01:11:55.774
- Amicable.

01:11:55.774 --> 01:11:59.691
- Not got it in
my vocabulary anymore.

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:12.164

01:12:12.164 --> 01:12:13.476
I've had enough.

01:12:13.476 --> 01:12:14.754
We've got to negotiate.

01:12:14.754 --> 01:12:16.014
- Negotiate?
- Yeah, negotiate.

01:12:16.014 --> 01:12:18.236
- What have we got to negotiate?

01:12:18.236 --> 01:12:20.284
Whether I'm gonna kill you or not?

01:12:20.284 --> 01:12:23.355
- Don't make me laugh.

01:12:23.355 --> 01:12:25.536
You're not going to kill me.

01:12:25.536 --> 01:12:26.806

I know you too well.

01:12:31.825 --> 01:12:33.436
