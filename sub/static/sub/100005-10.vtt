41:21.178 --> 41:24.011

to fuck me in the ass?

a single one of 'em

when I couldn't

42:05.053 --> 42:06.887
get an offer from
a single law firm?

42:09.011 --> 42:10.595
What did you tell me
when I cried?

42:10.595 --> 42:12.553
-Siobhan.
-What did you say to me?

42:12.553 --> 42:14.679
-Don't do this.
-What did you say?

42:14.679 --> 42:19.428
It's easier to bleed
than to sweat.

42:19.428 --> 42:22.929
-That's right.
-It's from an old Poitier movie.

42:22.929 --> 42:24.720
The line's still apt.

Feel bad for yourself tonight.

and go back to work.

42:35.428 --> 42:38.095

42:38.095 --> 42:41.387

come after you.

52:16.637 --> 52:18.470
Maybe you decide
to come after me.

52:20.345 --> 52:21.845
I'll be waitin'.

52:23.679 --> 52:25.804
