I pledge my troth unto thee
and have forsaken all others

20:21.849 --> 20:23.716
and cleave myself unto only you.

20:23.718 --> 20:26.052
I do.
Don't you agree, Laverne?

20:26.054 --> 20:28.020
I think I need...

20:28.022 --> 20:29.689
a doctor.

20:29.691 --> 20:31.490
Or a diaper.

20:31.492 --> 20:33.893
Okay, that wasn't word
perfect, but it will do.

20:33.895 --> 20:37.063
May I have the ring, please?

20:37.065 --> 20:39.832
Here you go, Grandpa.

20:39.834 --> 20:42.334
- What's this?
- Just put it on my finger.

20:42.336 --> 20:44.236
Put it on my finger.

20:44.238 --> 20:45.971
Come on, Laverne.

20:48.676 --> 20:50.042
- No...
- [groaning]

20:50.044 --> 20:52.578
[all gasping]

20:52.580 --> 20:55.287
<i>[tense music]</i>

20:55.288 --> 20:57.151
