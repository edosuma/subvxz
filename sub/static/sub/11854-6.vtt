rock song playing

00:37.417 --> 00:42.917
song continues

01:03.166 --> 01:05.083
Please! No...!

01:09.375 --> 01:13.458
song continues

01:33.375 --> 01:35.542
song ends

01:37.291 --> 01:39.333
Hey.
He here?

01:39.417 --> 01:40.542
Room "A."

01:40.625 --> 01:41.709
Doing what?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.375
Meet your new partner.

01:51.834 --> 01:57.125
<i>quiet, indistinct</i>
conversation

01:57.208 --> 01:58.834
RUSH:
Figured he'd make
a good impression,

01:58.917 --> 02:00.834
bringing his girlfriend
to headquarters his first day?

02:00.917 --> 02:03.375
VERA:
He says she's
an informant.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.583
Really.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.709
"Fugitives" has
something
interesting.

02:06.792 --> 02:09.166
Sherman picked up a guy
in Virginia last night.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.917
Wants to trade
information
on an old one.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.667
Do I break this up
and bring the new kid?

02:14.750 --> 02:16.041
DETECTIVE:
You get me what I need,

02:16.125 --> 02:17.792
I get you
that steak dinner.

02:17.875 --> 02:19.875
WOMAN
I know you will, too, Scotty.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.500
Get outta here now.

02:23.583 --> 02:24.667
I'm working.

02:32.458 --> 02:33.291
Hey, how's it going?

02:33.375 --> 02:34.875
Scotty Valens, from West.

02:34.959 --> 02:36.250
Nick Vera.
Congratulations.

02:36.333 --> 02:37.250
Yeah, thanks.

02:37.333 --> 02:38.959
Big leagues now, huh?

02:39.041 --> 02:40.750
Yeah.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.000
clearing throat

02:42.083 --> 02:43.792
That Hammond job
was some good work.

02:43.875 --> 02:45.333
Yeah, talk about
a bag of bones.

02:45.417 --> 02:46.792
But I got
an angle on
it.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.959
Figured that's what
got me to Homicide.

02:49.041 --> 02:50.625
This is Detective Rush.

02:50.709 --> 02:51.875
Her partner
transferred out.

02:51.959 --> 02:53.291
You'll be working
with her.

02:56.166 --> 02:57.709
Good luck.
Yeah.

02:59.041 --> 03:01.041
I see... you're Rush.

03:01.125 --> 03:03.125
Yeah.
Congratulations.

03:03.208 --> 03:05.166
I-I pictured a guy.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.166
You got the one girl
in the joint.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.917
Yeah... okay.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.125
We got an interview
in "Fugitives."

03:11.208 --> 03:12.750
Cool. What's our angle?

03:12.834 --> 03:15.291
Our angle is I talk, you listen.

03:22.125 --> 03:23.291
Got something
on a murder.

03:23.375 --> 03:24.417
What's that get me?

03:24.500 --> 03:26.208
Depends on what you did.

03:26.291 --> 03:29.917
Ricky was the driver
in a Fishtown drug shooting,
two months back.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.208
I was driving a guy
to a conversation.

03:31.291 --> 03:32.166
I didn't know he had a gun.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.000
Don't tell lies, Ricky.

03:33.083 --> 03:35.542
Kite okay making a deal?

03:35.625 --> 03:38.000
Yeah. Ricky here's small-time.

03:38.083 --> 03:39.875
Okay, what do you got?

03:39.959 --> 03:42.125
High school girl got iced
back in '81.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.041
It was big news, remember?

03:44.125 --> 03:45.125
Remind me.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.792
Paige Pratt.

03:46.875 --> 03:48.166
Keep going.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.458
I ain't saying
I saw the bullet leave the gun,

03:50.542 --> 03:53.125
but I did see something good.

03:54.208 --> 03:56.333
siren wailing

04:35.083 --> 04:37.000
<i>I put it all together.</i>

04:37.083 --> 04:38.875
Will Harrell must have
killed her.

04:38.959 --> 04:40.834
Are you trying to get
a deal off of that?

04:40.917 --> 04:42.458
It's good information.
It's crap.

04:42.542 --> 04:43.500
RUSH:
Valens,

04:43.583 --> 04:45.125
remember our angle.

04:45.208 --> 04:48.166
Okay.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.083
She was 16 years old?

04:50.166 --> 04:51.750
Yeah, real pretty.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.208
Track star. She had a future.

04:54.291 --> 04:56.208
Why didn't you say anything
back then, Ricky?

04:56.291 --> 05:00.041
I was going to the shop
that night to steal some stuff.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.208
Not gonna explain that.

05:01.291 --> 05:02.750
Mm-hmm.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.208
Okay, I'll check it out.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.875
Hey, it's going to get me
out of hot water, right?

05:06.959 --> 05:08.291
We'll see how this pans out.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.500
Here's the other part.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.208
Someone else went down for this.

05:12.291 --> 05:13.000
Yeah?

05:13.083 --> 05:13.875
Yeah.

05:13.959 --> 05:16.583
Some mope named Al Clarkson.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.000
He's doing life.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.917
The closed ones
are down here.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.917
VALENS:
Cold cases--
I don't know.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.917
I like being out on the street.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.500
Paige died in a field
near the Schuykill River.

06:03.583 --> 06:05.041
So, what, I work
a few of these,

06:05.125 --> 06:06.291
then go on the line?

06:06.375 --> 06:08.166
You act like this is
the B assignment, Scotty.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.959
Ain't it?

06:10.041 --> 06:13.250
Not to me. I chose it.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.375
Three blows to the head
that would have killed her

06:15.458 --> 06:16.834
even if she hadn't
been shot.

06:16.917 --> 06:17.625
Passion crime.

06:17.709 --> 06:19.125
Someone she knew.

06:19.208 --> 06:23.125
Al Clarkson was her boyfriend,
convicted in '83.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.500
Commonwealth must've had a case.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.000
Lots of testimony
he had a temper.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.166
That's nothing.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.792
His gold chain was found
at the scene.

06:28.875 --> 06:29.458
Better.

06:29.542 --> 06:30.291
Tracks matched

06:30.375 --> 06:31.625
the tires on his Nova.

06:31.709 --> 06:33.834
Goodrich TA Radial
or Uniroyal Tiger Paw?

06:33.917 --> 06:36.041
Uniroyal. How'd you know that?

06:36.125 --> 06:38.625
It's a popular tire upgrade
on a muscle car like that.

06:38.709 --> 06:40.166
You know a lot about cars?

06:40.250 --> 06:41.625
Everything.

06:41.709 --> 06:44.458
So this Will Harrell
that saw Ricky cleaning blood

06:44.542 --> 06:45.542
out of his car...?

06:45.625 --> 06:46.208
What kind of ride
he have?

06:46.291 --> 06:47.458
Trans Am.

06:47.542 --> 06:48.959
Could have easily had
those same tires.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.792
So it could have been
his car at the scene.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.583
All right. The snitch's story
gets some little credibility.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.291
Plus a head injury
means a lot of blood,

06:55.375 --> 06:57.500
but there wasn't much found
near Paige's body.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.667
So she did most of her bleeding
somewhere else.

06:59.750 --> 07:03.417
Like inside a car.

07:08.250 --> 07:11.333
So why do you like old jobs?

07:11.417 --> 07:13.291
You don't like
the action?

07:13.375 --> 07:15.333
Don't like bastards
getting away with murder.

07:23.417 --> 07:26.583
Will Harrell?

07:26.667 --> 07:28.542
You remember
a guy named
Rick Stockvis,

07:28.625 --> 07:31.166
used to work here?

07:31.250 --> 07:33.208
There's a name
I'd rather forget.

07:33.291 --> 07:34.125
Why's that?

07:34.208 --> 07:35.500
Guy was a thief.

07:35.583 --> 07:38.417
He was lifting our tools,
hocking 'em.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.333
We're checking a story
he told us

07:40.417 --> 07:42.875
about you washing blood
out your Trans Am,

07:42.959 --> 07:43.875
June 20, 1981.

07:43.959 --> 07:45.750
That's pretty specific.

07:45.834 --> 07:48.041
It was the same night
a girl named Paige Pratt died.

07:48.125 --> 07:50.417
No, that didn't happen.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.250
No.
Did you know Paige?

07:52.333 --> 07:53.417
Friend of the family,
church?

07:53.500 --> 07:54.875
I just said I didn't know her.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.709
You sold that car
pretty soon after her death.

07:56.792 --> 07:59.041
According to VIN records,
it was just six days later.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.291
I wanted the new ZX.

08:00.375 --> 08:01.834
What kind of tires
were you sporting, Will?

08:01.917 --> 08:02.959
Factory install or upgrade?

08:03.041 --> 08:04.458
I don't recall.

08:04.542 --> 08:06.125
Well, that's what records
are for.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.875
Mind if we sit in your office,
look through your paperwork?

08:08.959 --> 08:10.834
Yes, I do. I'm very busy.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.083
RUSH:
<i>Will got pretty hinky</i>
<i>near the end there.</i>

08:16.166 --> 08:18.542
Make any connect
between him and Paige?

08:18.625 --> 08:20.041
No. Went to different
high schools.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.750
That age, high school's
your whole world.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.125
Still looking for her parents.

08:23.208 --> 08:24.583
They're not at
their old address.

08:24.667 --> 08:25.959
You Valens?
Yeah.

08:26.041 --> 08:27.834
Will Jeffries. Congratulations.

08:27.917 --> 08:29.375
Thanks, man.
It's great being here.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.583
Jeffries and Vera
are a matching set.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.375
Someone named Roxy
called for you.

08:35.458 --> 08:36.417
Yeah? Good.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.417
Twice. Says she'll try you back.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.709
Yeah, she don't got a phone.

08:42.959 --> 08:44.041
You guys get a job?

08:44.125 --> 08:46.417
Confession at the scene.
Total duck.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.917
You wanna track this
old Trans Am for us?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
See if it's still on
the street somewhere?

08:49.083 --> 08:50.333
JEFFRIES:
Sure thing.

08:50.417 --> 08:53.041
Lill, you might want
to go see Al Clarkson.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.083
Get his view
of the world.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.250
You know, it'd be good

08:55.333 --> 08:56.500
to find the
second owner on
it.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.041
Whoever bought
it from Harrell.

08:58.125 --> 09:01.041
Thanks. We'll do that.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.750
You could learn something
from this guy.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.083
Stillman chuckles

09:15.834 --> 09:18.250
Yeah, I got a car habit.

09:18.333 --> 09:20.333
Mercedes taste
on a Mazda salary.

09:20.417 --> 09:21.458
I hear ya.

09:21.542 --> 09:22.959
So, did you break the bank
on that TA?

09:23.041 --> 09:24.291
Nah, that was a steal.

09:24.375 --> 09:26.458
Dumb kid didn't know
what it was worth.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.542
I sold it for twice what I paid.

09:28.625 --> 09:29.625
Why'd he sell
it
so cheap?

09:29.709 --> 09:30.959
WOMAN:
I didn't ask.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.625
A good deal falls in
your lap, you take it.

09:33.709 --> 09:34.834
Do you remember anything

09:34.917 --> 09:36.458
about the kid
you bought it from?

09:36.542 --> 09:39.458
Well, just that he kept
the car up pretty good.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.417
Seemed to love it,

09:41.500 --> 09:46.083
but still, he was selling.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.417
Look, my boss is giving me
the evil eye.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.667
Mind if we finish our coffee?

09:50.750 --> 09:52.458
Nah, live it up.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.125
So Will worked at an auto shop.

09:56.208 --> 09:58.625
He never heard
about Blue Book value?

09:58.709 --> 09:59.792
Motivated seller maybe.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.375
VALENS:
<i>West Detectives</i>
<i>was all about the volume.</i>

10:04.458 --> 10:05.667
Every night it's hoppin'.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.542
You're out there
running
your whole shift.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.083
That's why I'm saying,

10:09.166 --> 10:11.500
I just don't know
if Cold Cases is
gonna be my thing.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.959
And I just don't know
if you have a choice, Scotty.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.125
What do you want with me?

10:22.208 --> 10:23.500
Looking into your
case again, Al.

10:23.583 --> 10:24.875
"Lock him up
and throw away the key."

10:24.959 --> 10:26.041
That was my case.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.417
Well, we're looking
at it again.

10:29.166 --> 10:30.125
I didn't kill Paige.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.542
I got railroaded
because I was 21

10:31.625 --> 10:33.208
hanging with a high school girl.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.166
Those guys are
a little creepy, Al.

10:35.250 --> 10:36.250
I was a late bloomer.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.041
I see Rudy Tanner
was your lawyer.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.041
Strip mall hack.

10:39.125 --> 10:41.000
One of them guys
in bad clothes,

10:41.083 --> 10:43.458
dropping his folders
all over the place?

10:43.542 --> 10:44.750
That's him.

10:44.834 --> 10:46.250
I didn't know how
to find someone good.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.542
How do you explain
your gold chain

10:47.625 --> 10:48.625
being at the crime scene, Al?

10:48.709 --> 10:49.458
Paige was wearing it.

10:49.542 --> 10:50.375
She wear it a lot?

10:50.458 --> 10:51.208
When we were getting along.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.166
A lot of people say

10:52.250 --> 10:53.333
you had a real temper with her.

10:53.417 --> 10:55.375
She ran wild on me.

10:55.458 --> 10:57.375
I loved her, so it hurt.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.208
Jealousy ain't against
the law.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.959
How come you weren't with her
that night?

11:01.041 --> 11:03.375
She was supposed to be grounded,
but she must've snuck out.

11:03.458 --> 11:04.709
Energetic girl.

11:04.792 --> 11:07.583
Yeah, she was.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.000
My guess is she must have met
some guy.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.000
She had someone on her mind
around that time...

11:13.083 --> 11:14.375
What am I missing, Paige?

11:14.458 --> 11:15.458
You're here to run.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.667
Why you gotta wear
purple eye shadow?

11:16.750 --> 11:18.583
I can race and look good.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.417
Uh-huh. Which one is he?

11:20.500 --> 11:22.375
I'm tired of the
third degree, Al.

11:22.458 --> 11:23.417
And I'm tired
of being your fool.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.166
Who is he?

11:26.041 --> 11:27.917
Maybe you should just leave.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.959
I'll get my own ride home.

11:35.667 --> 11:36.375
So which one was he?

11:36.458 --> 11:38.875
Never found out.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.291
Think it could have been
this guy? Will Harrell?

11:41.375 --> 11:43.041
Nah, I never saw him.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.500
Okay, thanks for your time, Al.

11:48.583 --> 11:52.208
Yeah. Go pound sand.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.834
BOY:
You can just take my car?

12:04.917 --> 12:06.166
Don't worry, kid.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.667
We'll get it back
to you when we're done.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.458
There's a dance
Friday night.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.166
Will I have it
back by then?

12:12.250 --> 12:14.333
We'll do our best.

12:14.417 --> 12:15.959
Yeah, 'cause I just bought this.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.625
I've only had it for, like,
two weeks.

12:17.709 --> 12:20.208
First car, huh?

12:20.291 --> 12:21.625
Friday, right?

12:28.875 --> 12:31.000
Hope he's got insurance.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.750
Oh, he don't.

12:34.709 --> 12:37.542
Upholstery could've
been shampooed 50 times,

12:37.625 --> 12:40.000
we're still gonna know
if blood was shed in there.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.542
Figure out a Will and Paige
connect?

12:41.625 --> 12:42.875
She was an athlete at Crespi.

12:42.959 --> 12:44.166
He was a loser at Jefferson.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.667
No activities in common.

12:45.750 --> 12:49.000
So maybe Willy's hanging around
the wawa one night,

12:49.083 --> 12:50.709
looking for a party...

12:50.792 --> 12:52.041
He's got the car going for him.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.000
Paige needs a ride.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.500
He's a little mole.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.333
Doesn't do good with girls.
Makes a play for her.

12:56.417 --> 12:58.166
She brushes him off.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.667
Will breaks her head open.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.583
This is the cool part.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.083
JEFFRIES:
Hit the light.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.500
He knew her somehow.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.417
Found your old Trans Am, Will.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.291
Blood, blood, and more blood.

13:26.375 --> 13:27.208
Bull.

13:27.291 --> 13:29.000
Wanna see pictures?

13:31.458 --> 13:34.166
Okay. Just...

13:34.250 --> 13:37.000
Here's what happened.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.291
I... hit a dog
on the Turnpike.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.333
A dog.

13:41.417 --> 13:42.375
Yeah,
I-I put it in my car.

13:42.458 --> 13:43.917
I had to clean it out after.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.875
That's what Ricky
must have seen.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.375
You a special
kind
of stupid, Will?

13:48.458 --> 13:49.709
I'm not making it up.

13:49.792 --> 13:51.583
And the night
that girl was murdered,

13:51.667 --> 13:53.375
I was at
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

13:53.458 --> 13:55.000
You recall that now, too, huh?

13:55.083 --> 13:57.291
You guys coming around
made me think of it.

13:59.542 --> 14:01.166
Who'd you see the movie with?

14:01.250 --> 14:02.417
Bennett Cahill.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.291
My best friend.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.500
And his girlfriend Jane.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.417
JANE:
I have cheer
practice till
6:00.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.750
So when can we talk?

14:11.834 --> 14:13.709
Dinner at 6:30.

14:13.792 --> 14:15.917
So I should call you
at 6:45?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.792
Hey, guys.
Hey.

14:17.875 --> 14:20.041
Raiders

14:20.125 --> 14:21.125
Cool.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.208
Yeah. I'm getting
in line at noon.

14:23.291 --> 14:26.166
I'll get three tickets,
if you guys want to go.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.750
Yeah, sounds good.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.875
Okay, great. Saturday...

14:29.959 --> 14:31.083
<i>Raiders.</i>

14:31.166 --> 14:33.208
I still have the ticket stub
to prove it.

14:33.291 --> 14:36.375
You have the stub
from 22 years ago?

14:36.458 --> 14:37.834
Some good luck.

14:37.917 --> 14:39.458
It's my favorite movie.

14:39.542 --> 14:42.125
You keep
stuff
like that.

14:42.208 --> 14:43.875
Will, you do realize
that we have the
science

14:43.959 --> 14:45.208
to tell us
the
difference

14:45.291 --> 14:47.083
between dog and
human blood,
right?

14:47.166 --> 14:49.375
I have the ticket stub.

14:49.458 --> 14:51.500
You and Bennett
still close?

14:51.583 --> 14:52.917
Bennett's really successful.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.250
Always was.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.333
Class president,
went to Princeton.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.625
He's a surgeon now.

14:57.709 --> 14:59.458
You're friends with a surgeon?

14:59.542 --> 15:01.458
Old friends.

15:01.542 --> 15:05.458
Okay, Will,
we'll check out that story.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.000
I have the stub.

15:11.834 --> 15:15.333
So what happened
to your old
partner?

15:15.417 --> 15:16.333
Detailed out to H.I.U.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.750
Got to weed out the weak ones.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.667
He needed all day work
'cause of his diabetes.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.709
He wasn't... weak.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.667
Hi. Bennett Cahill.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.709
Detectives Rush
and Valens, Homicide.

15:34.792 --> 15:37.417
What's it about?

15:37.500 --> 15:39.542
Guy named Will Harrell.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.333
You went to
high school together.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.166
I could probably place him.

15:48.542 --> 15:50.500
Right, that guy.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.792
What'd he do?

15:51.875 --> 15:52.667
We don't know yet.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.083
Will says you and him

15:54.166 --> 15:55.834
were best friends.

15:55.917 --> 15:57.208
More like acquaintances.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.083
He says you went to
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

15:59.166 --> 16:01.166
with him and your girlfriend,
June 20, 1981.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.375
I doubt it.

16:03.458 --> 16:06.583
I probably was with Jane,
but, uh, Will...?

16:06.667 --> 16:08.291
Willy kind of an outcast type?

16:08.375 --> 16:10.333
You could say.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.041
He had this room

16:12.125 --> 16:13.875
at his dad's shop.

16:13.959 --> 16:15.542
It was a no-parents zone,
you know?

16:15.625 --> 16:18.583
So a lot of us would hang out
there, drink beer, whatever.

16:18.667 --> 16:19.917
How'd he do with the ladies?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.792
Don't recall any big scores.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.625
He ever mention

16:23.709 --> 16:25.291
a girl named Paige?

16:25.375 --> 16:27.375
No. But we didn't talk a lot.

16:27.458 --> 16:30.375
Uh... After he freaked me out
one night,

16:30.458 --> 16:32.417
I stopped going over there.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.542
What'd he do?

16:34.625 --> 16:36.583
He showed me a gun.

16:38.208 --> 16:39.667
Called it a bitch killer.

16:43.375 --> 16:46.917
Yeah. That's when I stopped
going over there.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.208
Will seem like he could
get frustrated enough

16:49.291 --> 16:50.542
to hurt a girl?

16:50.625 --> 16:51.875
I really don't know.

16:51.959 --> 16:54.291
Uh... I hope not.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.875
Will was a B-list kid
with A-list aspirations.

16:58.959 --> 17:01.542
Hottie like Paige would
have
blown him off for sure.

17:01.625 --> 17:04.500
He meets her, gets the snub,
it's the last straw.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.000
Pulls out his bitch killer.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.750
His what?

17:07.834 --> 17:09.417
Nothing, boss.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.709
Did you ever find
Paige's parents?

17:11.792 --> 17:14.417
Mm. Moved to Atlanta in '84.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.917
Aren't returning phone calls.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.333
They already got someone
in jail.

17:17.417 --> 17:18.458
Why relive the nightmare?

17:18.542 --> 17:21.375
DA's office
is gonna hate this.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.542
Well, Kite's already called
a hundred times.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.667
Who's Kite?

17:24.750 --> 17:28.458
Assistant D.A. Ivy League jerk.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.208
Criminalistics just called.

17:31.291 --> 17:33.917
It was Paige's
blood in the Trans
Am.

17:38.667 --> 17:39.917
I'm telling you I hit a dog.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.166
Well, that dog
had Paige Pratt's DNA.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.834
Look at the date.
Look at the date.

17:44.917 --> 17:46.333
June 20th, 1981.

17:46.417 --> 17:48.333
Heads up.

17:50.917 --> 17:52.125
Found the bitch killer.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.625
I've never seen that before
in my life.

17:53.709 --> 17:54.792
My money says

17:54.875 --> 17:56.250
this is the gun 'killed Paige.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.375
Party's over, Will.

17:57.458 --> 17:58.625
I was with Bennett
and Jane that
night!

17:58.709 --> 18:00.417
Yeah, we talked
to Bennett.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.041
He didn't back your story.

18:02.125 --> 18:02.959
What?

18:03.041 --> 18:04.125
Your "best friend"

18:04.208 --> 18:05.500
barely remembered
you, Willy.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.333
He said you were a nobody
in high school.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.417
A hanger-on who got used
by the popular kids

18:09.500 --> 18:11.000
'cause you gave them
a place to party.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.458
He didn't say that.

18:12.542 --> 18:14.417
He said he wouldn't be seen
at the movies with you.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.750
Or anywhere else.

18:26.792 --> 18:29.417
Well, then...

18:29.500 --> 18:31.375
Then screw him.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.500
You wanna know the truth?

18:35.583 --> 18:36.542
For a change, you mean?

18:36.625 --> 18:37.500
We were supposed to go

18:37.583 --> 18:38.834
to the movies that night.

18:38.917 --> 18:42.291
music playing

18:53.500 --> 18:55.458
Where the hell have you been?

18:58.333 --> 19:01.709
There was a problem.

19:01.792 --> 19:02.875
Is that... is that blood?

19:02.959 --> 19:05.458
I, uh, I hit a dog.

19:05.542 --> 19:07.667
You and Jane?

19:07.750 --> 19:09.792
No, it was just me. Uh...

19:09.875 --> 19:11.375
Uh...

19:11.458 --> 19:14.500
I tried to save it.
I took it to the vet.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.208
It bled
all over the seats.

19:17.291 --> 19:18.375
You should have called me.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.250
Yeah...

19:19.333 --> 19:20.792
faintly chuckles

19:20.875 --> 19:23.667
Well... upholstery's gonna need
to be cleaned out.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.417
I'll do it.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.959
Will...

19:27.041 --> 19:29.250
let's tell people that we went
Raiders,

19:29.333 --> 19:31.333
I don't want my mom
knowing about the dog.

19:31.417 --> 19:33.583
No...

19:33.667 --> 19:34.750
Sure.

19:34.834 --> 19:37.625
Thanks, pal.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.583
Dumb-ass story, Willy.

19:41.667 --> 19:42.667
WILL:
It's
true.
Yeah.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.250
I loaned Bennett my car.

19:44.333 --> 19:45.458
He must have killed that girl.

19:45.542 --> 19:47.125
And-and then put the
gun in the ceiling.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.583
Then why'd you
cover for him?

19:48.667 --> 19:51.750
Me and Bennett had a deal
not to talk about it.

19:51.834 --> 19:53.709
And...

19:53.792 --> 19:57.000
I-I thought we were friends.

20:07.333 --> 20:08.750
Hey, are we
going
to do this?

20:08.834 --> 20:10.917
Just a sec.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.542
You owe me a call, Rush.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.125
I was getting
to that today.

20:15.208 --> 20:17.959
There's a difference between
cold cases and closed cases.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.250
Do you get my meaning?

20:19.333 --> 20:20.959
You agreed to the
deal
with that snitch.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.208
No one mentioned
his information

20:22.291 --> 20:24.083
was on a case
we already won.

20:24.166 --> 20:28.000
Okay, then, we should
just ignore the DNA
and ballistics, huh?

20:28.083 --> 20:29.542
Am I supposed to go
to my boss and say,

20:29.625 --> 20:30.750
"Sorry, you screwed the pooch
on this one.

20:30.834 --> 20:32.458
We're just going to star over"?

20:32.542 --> 20:34.542
An innocent man's
been sitting in
jail for 22 years

20:34.625 --> 20:35.542
because of your boss.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.000
Why don't you tell him that?

20:37.083 --> 20:40.542
I don't spring Al Clarkson
until you arrest Harrell.

20:40.625 --> 20:41.959
I'm holding him.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.208
I want him arrested.

20:44.291 --> 20:45.625
I want to give it a day.

20:45.709 --> 20:46.875
No.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.583
Okay, then, well...

20:51.667 --> 20:53.041
Will's locked up.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.000
Who's that charmer?

21:00.875 --> 21:03.709
A.D.A. Kite.
He's above
cops.

21:03.792 --> 21:06.583
Ain't above checking you out.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.208
phone rings

21:14.375 --> 21:16.000
I thought you had
your guy, Lilly.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.625
I'm gonna check out
Will's story.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.166
Go through it all again, this
time with Bennett in mind.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.959
Don't matter that everything
points to Will?

21:22.041 --> 21:24.166
Al Clarkson got screwed
'cause the prosecutors

21:24.250 --> 21:25.667
didn't look at all the angles.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.000
I'm not doing that to Will.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.667
So, you looking for
a Bennett-Paige connect?

21:28.750 --> 21:30.083
Yeah.
Well...

21:30.166 --> 21:33.709
Here. Bennett was the captain
of his track team.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.125
Paige ran track for her school.

21:35.208 --> 21:36.542
They could have met that way.

21:36.625 --> 21:38.333
And Al thought
she was flirting with someone

21:38.417 --> 21:39.500
at a track meet, remember?

21:39.583 --> 21:40.583
Now something's cooking.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.166
Just a month before.

21:44.625 --> 21:45.583
We going back to the doc?

21:45.667 --> 21:47.834
No, let's go to the girlfriend

21:47.917 --> 21:50.959
he was supposedly with
that night: Jane.

21:51.041 --> 21:52.709
You guys keep reading.

21:52.792 --> 21:54.125
Sure.

21:54.208 --> 21:56.500
Then we'll wash your car.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.500
RUSH:
We have some questions
about Bennett Cahill.

22:00.834 --> 22:01.792
Did something happen to him?

22:01.875 --> 22:04.208
VALENS:
Nah. Alive and kicking.

22:04.291 --> 22:06.166
RUSH:
He was your high school
boyfriend, right?

22:06.250 --> 22:07.583
All four years.

22:07.667 --> 22:08.667
Pretty serious?

22:08.750 --> 22:10.333
Very-- but,
uh,
then we went

22:10.417 --> 22:12.667
to different
colleges,
lost touch...

22:14.000 --> 22:16.875
Either of you date anyone else
in high school?

22:16.959 --> 22:18.500
No. No, we were together.

22:18.583 --> 22:22.000
So there wasn't a girl named
Paige Pratt in your lives?

22:22.083 --> 22:24.291
RUSH:
She went to Crespi.

22:24.375 --> 22:25.417
Ran track, like Bennett.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.875
I know who you're talking about,

22:27.959 --> 22:29.917
because of what happened to her.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.625
But we didn't know her.

22:31.709 --> 22:33.500
You and Bennett knew
all the same people?

22:33.583 --> 22:35.667
Why are you asking about this?

22:35.750 --> 22:37.834
Someone was convicted
of that crime.

22:37.917 --> 22:39.041
He's been unconvicted.

22:40.834 --> 22:42.208
And what do you want from me?

22:42.291 --> 22:43.625
I don't suppose you remember

22:43.709 --> 22:46.333
what you were doing
June 20, 1981?

22:46.417 --> 22:47.792
Of course she doesn't.

22:47.875 --> 22:49.834
Actually, I do.

22:52.417 --> 22:54.083
For good reason.

22:57.625 --> 22:59.125
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

22:59.208 --> 23:00.500
I'm sure.

23:00.583 --> 23:02.709
You know, we don't have to.

23:02.792 --> 23:04.375
I want to.

23:04.458 --> 23:05.959
We love each other,

23:06.041 --> 23:10.041
and... if we're gonna
take it to the next
level...

23:12.417 --> 23:15.375
RUSH:
First time, huh?

23:15.458 --> 23:16.542
Sweet.

23:16.625 --> 23:17.875
Yeah.

23:17.959 --> 23:19.542
His first time, too?

23:19.625 --> 23:22.375
We were devoted to each other.

23:22.458 --> 23:23.291
So that's a yes?

23:23.375 --> 23:25.125
That's a yes.

23:25.208 --> 23:26.792
You ain't covering for Bennett

23:26.875 --> 23:28.709
all this time later,
are you, Janie?

23:29.875 --> 23:33.834
Bennett Cahill was an angel.

23:33.917 --> 23:35.625
"Angel"-- yeesh.

23:35.709 --> 23:37.792
You want to write up
her interview?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.333
Yeah.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.875
While you're at it,
you got to redo Clarkson's.

23:41.959 --> 23:43.000
What do you mean?

23:43.083 --> 23:44.834
Uh, you wrote it
in the third person.

23:44.917 --> 23:46.917
It's got to be in their words.

23:47.917 --> 23:49.333
Rush!

23:49.417 --> 23:50.208
We got goods.

23:50.291 --> 23:51.834
Yeah?
Look at this.

23:51.917 --> 23:53.500
Three pages of blah, blah, blah,

23:53.583 --> 23:57.166
but then, look what this girl
says to Paige at the end.

23:58.083 --> 23:59.917
"Forget the A,
go for the B."

24:00.000 --> 24:02.458
Yeah. Could be grades,
could be Al and
Bennett.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.792
Not bad.
Mm.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.166
RUSH:
Probably wrote
it that way

24:05.250 --> 24:06.500
in case Al
ever read
it.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.125
Who's Heidi?

24:08.208 --> 24:09.625
Tracking her down.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.083
I'll go you one better.

24:11.166 --> 24:15.792
Surveillance pictures of
Al Clarkson before his arrest.

24:15.875 --> 24:18.333
These were taken at
Paige's memorial service.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.917
What's Bennett doing there?

24:22.709 --> 24:26.417
BENNETT:
<i>I have surgery in ten minutes.</i>
Can we make this brief, please?

24:26.500 --> 24:27.417
RUSH:
Sure.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.959
Were you screwing Paige Pratt?

24:29.041 --> 24:30.875
I didn't even know her.

24:30.959 --> 24:33.000
You just like
memorial services?

24:39.917 --> 24:42.291
Feel like I'm 18 again.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.792
Huh.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.125
I guess there's no reason
to lie now.

24:49.583 --> 24:51.250
I did know Paige...

24:53.291 --> 24:55.125
...for about an hour.

25:06.917 --> 25:08.333
Call me when you get home?

25:08.417 --> 25:10.250
The very moment.

25:24.333 --> 25:26.083
Hi.

25:26.166 --> 25:29.166
Hi.

25:29.250 --> 25:30.792
Did you miss your ride?

25:30.875 --> 25:32.750
Yeah.

25:32.834 --> 25:34.250
Can you believe it?

25:34.333 --> 25:37.041
How far do you live?

25:37.125 --> 25:39.667
Not that far.
Six miles.

25:39.750 --> 25:42.166
I can pay you for gas.

25:53.959 --> 25:56.959
I've always noticed you.

25:57.041 --> 26:00.166
I look for you
at all the
meets.

26:02.417 --> 26:04.792
BENNETT:
Yeah, I've seen you too.

26:04.875 --> 26:06.417
What did you think?

26:10.000 --> 26:11.792
I thought
I gotta meet that girl.

26:17.583 --> 26:20.291
It was a stupid...
a stupid thing to do.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.959
I... I had a girlfriend.

26:23.041 --> 26:26.333
This was the girl that
I was going to spend
the rest of my life with.

26:26.417 --> 26:28.125
Yeah, but she wasn't providing.

26:30.083 --> 26:31.333
I dropped Paige at home,

26:31.417 --> 26:33.000
never saw her again.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.917
The only one who ever
existed to me was Jane.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.375
But after Paige
died,
you felt guilty.

26:37.458 --> 26:39.250
That's why I went
to the service.

26:39.333 --> 26:41.375
Did Jane know about this?

26:44.041 --> 26:45.917
Jane and I had an epic love.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.834
She couldn't know about it.

26:48.917 --> 26:50.291
It would've killed her.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.208
You talked to Janie lately?

26:54.333 --> 26:55.667
Mm-mm.

26:55.750 --> 26:58.041
Breaking up
was so awful, we, uh...

26:58.125 --> 27:00.625
we knew we could
never speak again.

27:08.166 --> 27:10.625
Paige had a huge crush
on Bennett.

27:10.709 --> 27:14.375
But he was a senior at
Jefferson, and very taken.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.417
JEFFRIES:
By Jane.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.041
Was she a bitch.

27:18.125 --> 27:20.041
Yeah? Why?

27:20.125 --> 27:21.417
Well, when she found out about

27:21.500 --> 27:24.458
Paige and Bennett
doing it that one time...

27:24.542 --> 27:25.875
she kept calling Paige up

27:25.959 --> 27:30.500
and saying "You're a damn slut"
and all this...

27:30.583 --> 27:31.875
How do you know
it was Jane?

27:31.959 --> 27:35.250
Well, she was head
cheerleader at
Jefferson.

27:35.333 --> 27:37.041
I knew her squeaky
little voice.

27:37.125 --> 27:38.959
So you didn't tell the cops
about this.

27:39.041 --> 27:40.959
It didn't seem important.

27:41.041 --> 27:45.625
Al was such a slime bag, we
all just thought he did it.

27:45.709 --> 27:47.375
Did Paige ever
see Bennett again?

27:47.458 --> 27:49.792
No.

27:49.875 --> 27:52.542
Track season was over.

27:52.625 --> 27:55.041
She was still hung
up
on him, though.

27:55.125 --> 27:57.250
Wrote me all these
notes about him...

27:57.333 --> 28:00.125
Mm... You still have
any of those notes?

28:00.208 --> 28:03.959
No. I wish I did.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.083
Is it true
that Al
didn't kill
her?

28:06.166 --> 28:08.000
Looks that way.

28:09.750 --> 28:13.000
That's a wasted life, huh?

28:17.917 --> 28:20.083
RUSH:
Bennett and Jane
supposedly

28:20.166 --> 28:22.250
had this epic love...

28:22.333 --> 28:23.417
mock gasp

28:23.500 --> 28:25.083
...till Bennett cheats.

28:25.166 --> 28:26.959
He says Janie didn't know,

28:27.041 --> 28:29.542
but she knew enough to
call Paige to tell her off.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.625
So Bennett could've done it
to shut Paige up

28:31.709 --> 28:33.458
or Jane could've done it
out of revenge.

28:33.542 --> 28:34.667
And poor Will's
sitting in lockup.

28:34.750 --> 28:36.250
phone rings

28:36.333 --> 28:38.250
Not a good time.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.083
Complicated social life.

28:40.166 --> 28:42.083
So what's with the origami?

28:42.166 --> 28:44.375
Letters from Paige
to her best friend.

28:44.458 --> 28:46.667
Full of dirty details
about Bennett.

28:46.750 --> 28:47.959
Uh-huh.

28:48.041 --> 28:51.208
Here's another one.

28:51.291 --> 28:53.166
A little more loopy
with the letters.

28:53.250 --> 28:56.083
How do I get stuck doing this?

28:56.166 --> 28:57.542
I'm doing the fancy folding.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.959
We're in the middle of dinner.

29:04.041 --> 29:05.709
We gotta talk
about Bennett and Paige.

29:06.792 --> 29:08.125
sighing
What about them?

29:08.208 --> 29:09.542
Come on now, Jane.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.834
It was a one-time thing.

29:15.917 --> 29:17.125
Is that what he told you?

29:17.208 --> 29:19.583
He begged my forgiveness.
We moved past it.

29:19.667 --> 29:23.041
But Bennett wasn't
a virgin anymore.

29:23.125 --> 29:25.000
That must've hurt.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.625
It was a one-time thing.

29:28.333 --> 29:29.834
Not according to these.

29:29.917 --> 29:32.750
Paige wrote these
notes
to her friend Heidi.

29:32.834 --> 29:34.000
They're all about Bennett

29:34.083 --> 29:36.291
and the nine times
she was with him.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.500
I, um...

29:38.583 --> 29:40.917
highlighted the good parts.

29:56.834 --> 29:58.875
She was a liar.

29:58.959 --> 30:00.250
And a slut, right?

30:00.333 --> 30:02.125
Like you told her on the phone.

30:02.208 --> 30:03.875
You should go.

30:03.959 --> 30:05.291
I'll just leave
these for you.

30:05.375 --> 30:07.542
Still want to stick
with your story, Jane?

30:07.625 --> 30:08.709
That you and Bennett had

30:08.792 --> 30:11.208
your first time
June 20, or...

30:11.291 --> 30:13.458
did something else
go on that night?

30:13.542 --> 30:15.959
I told you what happened.

30:16.041 --> 30:17.709
Well, I'll be meeting
with Bennett

30:17.792 --> 30:19.208
first thing tomorrow morning.

30:19.291 --> 30:21.417
Hopefully,
your stories will match.

30:32.792 --> 30:34.000
How'd it go?

30:34.083 --> 30:36.917
We'll see.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.083
phone rings

30:42.250 --> 30:44.208
clears throat

30:46.166 --> 30:47.250
It was just Roxy.

30:48.333 --> 30:49.959
That the one
from the other morning?

30:50.041 --> 30:52.417
Nah, that's Blair.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.083
So which one's your girl?

30:55.166 --> 30:56.667
I don't got a girl.

30:56.750 --> 30:58.750
They're, uh, contacts
on the Hammond case.

30:58.834 --> 31:00.417
I'm still
looking
for a guy.

31:02.458 --> 31:05.291
You know, in West,

31:05.375 --> 31:09.041
we didn't write our interviews
first person.

31:09.125 --> 31:10.750
In Homicide we do.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.542
Uh-huh.

31:12.625 --> 31:15.917
Homicide's got the best guys,
Scotty.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.709
You're not gonna be
the superstar your first week.

31:28.375 --> 31:30.583
VALENS:
There she goes.

31:43.041 --> 31:45.792
The surgeon
blowing her
off?

31:45.875 --> 31:48.542
He's coming.

31:53.375 --> 31:54.458
Nice ride.

31:54.542 --> 31:56.667
VALENS:
Wants to show
the old girlfriend

31:56.750 --> 31:58.625
how good he did in life.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.875
Rush chuckles

32:31.500 --> 32:33.792
no audio

32:44.125 --> 32:46.250
Be a good time
to bring 'em in.

32:54.208 --> 32:55.875
RUSH:
You know
Will Harell's sitting

32:55.959 --> 32:58.792
in jail right now,
don't you, Bennett?

32:58.875 --> 33:03.166
Yeah... mm...
and I feel bad about it.

33:03.250 --> 33:05.667
But you... you really
should be talking to
Jane.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.834
Except Jane didn't
borrow Will's car that night,

33:07.917 --> 33:09.208
where Paige's blood
ended up.

33:09.291 --> 33:11.041
I borrowed it, and
then
let Jane take it out

33:11.125 --> 33:12.333
with her
cheerleader
friends.

33:12.417 --> 33:13.333
Gosh!

33:13.417 --> 33:16.041
The new stories
just keep coming.

33:20.291 --> 33:23.250
She came and told me
what she did.

33:24.500 --> 33:28.250
I loved her, so I
helped clean up
after.

33:28.333 --> 33:30.166
When she found out
about Paige and me,

33:30.250 --> 33:31.583
she wanted one thing.

33:31.667 --> 33:32.959
What was that?

33:33.041 --> 33:35.291
To see her dead.

33:35.375 --> 33:37.083
JANE:
Get away.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.542
How could you do that?!

33:40.625 --> 33:42.375
It was meaningless.

33:42.458 --> 33:44.542
I was stupid. I'm sorry.

33:44.625 --> 33:46.250
I was going to give myself
to you,

33:46.333 --> 33:48.834
and you just threw it away
on this nobody.

33:48.917 --> 33:50.500
Th-This can't ruin
what we have.

33:50.583 --> 33:52.875
What we had is gone.

33:52.959 --> 33:54.917
I can't be
with you
now.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.583
Jane.

34:00.750 --> 34:02.083
Who is she?

34:05.709 --> 34:08.375
She was over at Will's
all the time, too.

34:08.458 --> 34:11.458
She told me that
she hid the gun
there.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.083
She told you she killed her?

34:13.166 --> 34:15.625
It'll be hard for
you to understand.

34:15.709 --> 34:19.208
But Jane and I had
something
that most people don't.

34:19.291 --> 34:22.333
In our situation, it,
it didn't seem wrong.

34:22.417 --> 34:25.250
What situation?

34:25.333 --> 34:27.458
Love.

34:27.542 --> 34:30.417
Ours was different
than other people's.

34:31.709 --> 34:33.667
You said the guy
was an angel.

34:33.750 --> 34:35.417
Now he's a killer?

34:37.333 --> 34:39.375
This was Bennett's doing.

34:39.458 --> 34:40.709
That's not what he says, Janie.

34:40.792 --> 34:42.458
He says you were so jealous
of Paige,

34:42.542 --> 34:44.250
you went out and shot her dead.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.792
I shot her?

34:46.875 --> 34:48.291
That's his position.

34:49.834 --> 34:53.250
He came to me, crawling...

34:53.333 --> 34:58.375
saying he'd do anything,
anything...

34:58.458 --> 35:00.750
to be together again.

35:00.834 --> 35:03.333
Guess what that "anything" was?

35:03.417 --> 35:06.750
Please talk to me.

35:06.834 --> 35:08.333
We're through, Bennett.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.625
No. I have to
have you back.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.000
What do you
want me to do?

35:12.083 --> 35:13.792
Name it. I'll do
whatever you say.

35:13.875 --> 35:15.000
There's nothing to do.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.917
Yes, there is.
I know there
is,

35:17.000 --> 35:18.667
and I'll do it.

35:21.458 --> 35:26.333
He got a gun... he
took
her out to a field...

35:26.417 --> 35:29.667
and got her
out
of our lives.

35:29.750 --> 35:33.041
Came and told me
about it.

35:33.125 --> 35:35.625
And you kept
that secret for him.

35:35.709 --> 35:37.208
What else could I do?

35:37.291 --> 35:39.375
Head for the hills
and call the cops.

35:39.458 --> 35:44.208
I don't think you're hearing me.

35:44.291 --> 35:49.625
He loved me so much,
he did murder for me.

35:49.709 --> 35:52.250
I've been looking through
your yearbook, Bennett.

35:52.333 --> 35:54.375
You and Janie
are all over it.

35:54.458 --> 35:55.875
"Best Couple."

35:55.959 --> 35:57.500
Prom king
and queen?

35:57.583 --> 35:59.583
Junior and senior prom.

35:59.667 --> 36:01.041
VALENS:
Ah, must've been great.

36:01.125 --> 36:02.500
Yeah.

36:02.583 --> 36:05.917
Me, I can't keep
a girl's attention

36:06.000 --> 36:07.291
longer than
three
months.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.583
I've never been lucky
in love either.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.083
I wouldn't call it "luck."

36:12.166 --> 36:12.875
Fate?

36:12.959 --> 36:14.375
That's closer.

36:14.458 --> 36:16.542
Jane and I used to
say that we were
as...

36:16.625 --> 36:19.542
we were as rare
as Halley's Comet.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.333
That's amazing.

36:21.417 --> 36:24.417
Too bad you ruined it
with that fling with Paige.

36:24.500 --> 36:25.750
I didn't ruin it.

36:25.834 --> 36:28.125
No? How do you make up
for something like that?

36:28.917 --> 36:29.917
We figured out a way.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.625
How?

36:34.667 --> 36:35.875
Look, I got no chance
at Halley's Comet--

36:35.959 --> 36:37.250
neither does he--

36:37.333 --> 36:41.125
so we really need you
to help us understand.

36:41.208 --> 36:42.834
We made a plan.

36:46.166 --> 36:47.875
I know what we can do.

36:47.959 --> 36:48.792
You do?

36:48.875 --> 36:50.417
I know how we can be together.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.458
Tell me.

36:51.542 --> 36:55.208
If we kill her,
we can erase her,

36:55.291 --> 36:57.792
and then you'll
be a virgin again.

36:59.291 --> 37:00.166
Yeah?

37:00.250 --> 37:02.250
It's to save us.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.208
You're right.

37:07.291 --> 37:09.333
You're right.

37:11.542 --> 37:13.375
You'll have to take
my word for it.

37:13.458 --> 37:14.625
It made sense.

37:14.709 --> 37:17.500
VALENS:
Well, that's how it went.

37:17.583 --> 37:18.709
How what went?

37:18.792 --> 37:19.792
The murder.

37:19.875 --> 37:21.458
RUSH:
'Bout the
gun,

37:21.542 --> 37:23.458
the barbells.
I don't know
what you mean.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.583
How you were gonna sink her
in the river after.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.458
I don't...

37:27.542 --> 37:28.959
believe you.

37:30.625 --> 37:33.750
'Bout Halley's Comet.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.125
He told you about that?

37:40.208 --> 37:41.500
And he wants to know

37:41.583 --> 37:44.250
if you want to
do this
together.

37:49.208 --> 37:53.000
What we thought
would save us...

37:53.083 --> 37:54.583
actually ruined us.

37:54.667 --> 38:00.166
After she died,
we could never get
back the purity.

38:00.250 --> 38:04.166
BENNETT:
So we separated,
never talked
again.

38:04.250 --> 38:08.333
And the worst thing?

38:08.417 --> 38:11.250
We never loved
anyone else
again,

38:11.333 --> 38:13.875
not the way
we loved each
other.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.542
That's the worst thing, huh?

38:21.208 --> 38:22.917
We belong together.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.500
We'll go down together.

38:25.792 --> 38:29.208
over phone
Paige? It's Bennett.

38:29.291 --> 38:30.875
I didn't think you'd call.

38:30.959 --> 38:31.875
Yeah,

38:31.959 --> 38:35.458
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

38:35.542 --> 38:37.709
I've been, uh...

38:37.792 --> 38:40.709
Well, Jane and I broke up.

38:40.792 --> 38:42.250
I'm sorry.

38:42.333 --> 38:46.792
Yeah. And I was wondering
if you wanted to get together.

38:46.875 --> 38:49.542
Tonight.
I know it's late, but...

38:49.625 --> 38:50.792
I can sneak out.

38:50.875 --> 38:53.000
Yeah, I'll pick you up
in ten minutes?

39:03.458 --> 39:05.083
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

39:05.166 --> 39:06.500
Absolutely.

39:06.583 --> 39:08.667
You know, we don't have to...

39:08.750 --> 39:10.792
I want to.

39:10.875 --> 39:12.667
We love each other,

39:12.750 --> 39:14.000
and...

39:14.083 --> 39:17.333
if we're gonna take
it
to the next
level...

39:17.417 --> 39:20.250
then...

39:20.333 --> 39:22.583
whispering

39:30.166 --> 39:31.500
Hi.

39:31.583 --> 39:32.917
Hey.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.166
Nice car.

39:34.250 --> 39:35.458
Where are we going?

39:35.542 --> 39:37.875
A nice, quiet place.

40:03.875 --> 40:06.917
Well, I guess it's time.

40:08.625 --> 40:09.208
Do it!

40:09.291 --> 40:10.917
gasps

40:12.625 --> 40:15.000
shrieking

40:17.250 --> 40:18.959
screaming

40:19.041 --> 40:20.750
Oh, no!

40:20.834 --> 40:22.834
Bennett grunts

40:22.917 --> 40:24.000
PAIGE:
No!

40:24.083 --> 40:26.875
Paige groaning

40:30.875 --> 40:32.709
JANE:
Do it! You have to do it!

40:32.792 --> 40:34.834
Do it! You have to do it!

40:56.000 --> 40:57.792
crying
Please! No...!

40:59.041 --> 41:02.083
crying
Please... don't...

41:18.458 --> 41:21.291
I can't believe it.

41:34.917 --> 41:38.041
slow '80s rock ballad begins

42:04.000 --> 42:06.083
song continues

42:33.041 --> 42:37.083
song continues

43:08.000 --> 43:18.792
song continues
