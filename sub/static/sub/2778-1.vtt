Lafayette Courier.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.482
Got 'er. Thank you.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.650
Bye-bye.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.189
Cam!

01:30.191 --> 01:31.490
Have you seen Cam?

01:40.300 --> 01:42.568
Cam!
Where in the hell is he?

01:42.570 --> 01:44.203
Cam, where you at, buddy?

01:44.205 --> 01:45.671
Damn!

01:45.673 --> 01:49.141
Cam!
Uptown express, okay!

03:03.550 --> 03:05.350
- Unh!

03:15.428 --> 03:16.495
Are you okay?

03:16.497 --> 03:17.863
Yeah. I'm fine.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.836
Hey, you!
Come back here.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.672
Sorry about your bike.

03:28.474 --> 03:31.577
Come back here!

03:45.526 --> 03:47.759
Cam.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.429
Cam.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.599
You want
your check or not?

03:53.601 --> 03:54.881
Sorry.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.407
Lonnie,
I need more runs.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.742
Cam, I'm happy
to help you out,

04:03.744 --> 04:05.877
but you need
a bike first, man.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.915
Got a friend
that can loan you one?

04:13.286 --> 04:16.555
Hey, uh...

04:16.557 --> 04:17.789
keep your head up.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.033
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

04:28.035 --> 04:29.568
- Hey!
- What?

04:29.570 --> 04:30.702
Where you been hiding?

04:36.876 --> 04:38.043
Whatcha got there, Cam?

04:38.045 --> 04:39.745
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

04:41.881 --> 04:44.416
Okay, so what?
You forget about us or what?

04:44.418 --> 04:45.751
No, no, no, I didn't...
I didn't forget.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.320
I just...
I didn't have it.
I just got that.

04:48.322 --> 04:51.056
Okay. Well,
what else you got?

04:51.058 --> 04:53.358
- Come on.
- Come on, man.

04:55.895 --> 04:57.062
Are you serious?

04:58.698 --> 04:59.978
I am serious.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.574
- What is that, $9.00?
- Yeah, $9.00, probably.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.296
- Where's all your
money going, man?
- To you guys!

05:13.514 --> 05:15.981
You came to us
for a loan, right, Cam?

05:15.983 --> 05:18.884
You accepted our terms.
1500.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.852
On the first
of each month, every month.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.754
I know. I know.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.656
I-I-I'm sorry.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.425
I... I'm sorry
I missed a payment.
It won't happen again.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.593
No, it won't.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.362
Now. Sign this please.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.664
Jerry,
I owe somebody rent.
Don't you wanna...

05:32.666 --> 05:35.000
And what, you think
I'm doing this for fun?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.803
- No, I c...
- This is my job, Cam, okay?

05:37.805 --> 05:40.672
I got a boss
just like you got a boss.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.808
Now just sign it, okay?

05:45.078 --> 05:47.646
This is the second time
you've been late.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.849
And, uh,
that makes us, um...

05:50.851 --> 05:52.751
- What's that make us?
- Nervous.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.453
- Nervous. See?
- Yeah.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.620
Hu is nervous.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.890
So, you owe us $15,000.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.027
And just don't miss
another payment.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.562
I won't.

06:10.636 --> 06:12.637
Don't miss another payment.

06:12.639 --> 06:13.939
I know.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.467
- You good, buddy?
- Yeah.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.768
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.903
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

07:17.905 --> 07:18.905
Okay.

07:20.072 --> 07:21.740
Where's your bike?

07:21.742 --> 07:24.042
I, uh,
I hit a pothole.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.014
It looks like you got
bigger problems.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.296
Let's get in here.

07:34.153 --> 07:36.888
All right.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.130
When are we gonna go
for a ride?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.092
Car's still broken, buddy.

07:41.094 --> 07:44.229
I haven't had time
to work on it.

07:44.231 --> 07:48.800
And I don't have the money
or the parts I need.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.769
Maybe you ought
to sell it.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.507
Yeah, maybe.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.741
Joey?

07:56.743 --> 07:58.844
All right,
you're good to go.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.512
Thanks a lot, Cam.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.013
You're welcome.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.095
I told you to give Cam
his space.

08:05.184 --> 08:07.152
Chill-lax, Mom.
It's all gravy.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.820
Chill-lax?

08:08.822 --> 08:09.988
Sorry about that.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.090
Don't worry about it.
He's a good kid.

08:13.626 --> 08:14.893
Hey, Ang.

08:14.895 --> 08:18.029
Can I talk to you
for a second?

08:18.031 --> 08:20.031
I'm gonna be a little late
on the rent this month.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.701
I'm sorry.
I'll get it to you
as soon as I can.

08:22.703 --> 08:26.137
I know you're good for it,
but I'm having a tough month.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.539
Try your best,
please, Cam?

08:27.541 --> 08:30.108
I know. I will.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.576
Thank you.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.278
Yeah?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.913
You coming
in today or not?

10:17.149 --> 10:19.818
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Do you not remember?

10:19.820 --> 10:21.886
What do you want me
to do with your new bike, then?

10:23.756 --> 10:25.824
What new bike?

10:25.826 --> 10:28.186
The one
your girlfriend dropped off
for you this morning.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.739
I don't have a girlfriend.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.311
- Hey!
- What do you want?

12:14.867 --> 12:16.501
To... to say thank you.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.203
- For what?
- What do you mean for what?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.238
For the bike you got me.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.473
You're welcome.

12:21.475 --> 12:24.042
Do you, uh...

12:24.044 --> 12:26.177
How did you learn
how to do parkour?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.014
What, did I say it wrong?

12:34.954 --> 12:36.714
- I gotta go.
- Wait, what's your name?

12:40.459 --> 12:41.860
Do you ride?

12:41.862 --> 12:44.829
No. A bike's a ball
and chain.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.231
Oh, yeah?

12:46.233 --> 12:47.932
All right.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.934
Well, you know,
anybody can...

12:49.936 --> 12:53.538
hop up and climb this thing.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.440
I'd like to see that.

12:59.145 --> 13:00.445
All right.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.913
You got it.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.196
Maybe you should stick
to the bike.

13:20.399 --> 13:21.933
Screw it.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.208
I'm Cam.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.576
Nikki.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.246
You want to show me
something else?

14:05.912 --> 14:06.945
Unh.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.314
Ugh.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.184
You gotta learn how to see.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.920
I can see just fine.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.522
If you want to vault the car,
don't look at the car,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.157
look where the car isn't.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.392
Okay.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.142
Whoa, hey!
How did you get over there?

14:38.144 --> 14:40.445
Nice to meet you, Cam.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.980
Who are you?

14:48.988 --> 14:50.121
What are you doing here,
Dylan?

14:50.123 --> 14:52.290
I'm just looking out for you,
Nicks.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.592
So what, you're just
spying on me the whole time?

14:54.594 --> 14:57.428
- You working out alone?
- So what?

14:57.430 --> 14:59.564
So you gotta be careful.
That's all I'm saying.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.332
You gotta stay off my ass,
Dyl.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.934
Who is this guy?

15:04.403 --> 15:06.404
He's nobody.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.573
Haven't seen you
around.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.108
I haven't been around.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.242
Where'd you find him?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.411
He found me.

15:13.413 --> 15:17.081
- You following her?
- No, no.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.683
Just saw her in the park.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.624
You know
this is dangerous stuff.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.993
You get hurt
if you don't know
what you're doing.

15:33.565 --> 15:34.966
Let's bounce.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.485
Wonderful.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.367
Well, some of this stuff
is kinda beat up,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.269
but uh...

16:11.271 --> 16:13.571
I'll give you 450.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.678
Look, my rent's $550.
Can you go there?

16:24.717 --> 16:29.153
One, two, three,
four, five, fifty.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.455
Thanks.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.371
Thanks a lot.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.240
How much for
the muscle car, kid?

16:46.171 --> 16:49.173
It was my Dad's.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.009
I'm gonna have to hold onto it.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.643
Too bad, nice car.

17:16.335 --> 17:18.569
Hey, Cam!
You saw that, mom?

17:18.570 --> 17:20.251
Yeah, I did, baby.
Come on...

17:21.473 --> 17:22.807
Hey, Joey!

17:36.355 --> 17:38.156
It's not much to look at,

17:38.158 --> 17:39.490
but... Okay.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.059
Better watch the potholes
this time, all right?

17:41.061 --> 17:42.393
Hey, buddy.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.829
Looks like
somebody's been
practicing.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.697
You should come work out
with us.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.199
I never see you
guys around.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.767
We're a tight group.

19:29.769 --> 19:30.902
We like to keep
to ourselves.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.372
Loujaine floating
terminal in Brooklyn.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.374
- You know it?
- No.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.843
Pier 62. Gowanus Bay.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.511
I'll see you at dawn.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.846
All right.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.706
Hey, guys.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.511
I'm Dylan.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.546
This is Tate, Jax.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.681
- How's it going?
- Cam.

20:16.683 --> 20:17.982
What's up?

20:17.984 --> 20:19.483
This is my sister Nikki.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.818
We already met.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.370
This is awesome.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.533
What are we supposed to do?

20:46.745 --> 20:47.878
Try and keep up.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.201
Holy shit!
He's dead, dude.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.514
Hey, there.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.350
You must be Cam.

22:32.352 --> 22:35.386
Dylan tells me
you're new to parkour.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.555
He also said
you're pretty good.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.623
Might have to, uh,
work on this jump though.

22:42.427 --> 22:43.427
I'm Miller.

22:51.570 --> 22:53.404
Pick a fight with gravity
before you're ready,

22:53.406 --> 22:54.739
you tend to get a beating.

22:54.741 --> 22:57.181
I don't know
what I'm doing.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.111
That's the great thing
about parkour, my friend.

23:00.113 --> 23:01.645
There are no rules.

23:01.647 --> 23:04.515
- You all right?
- I'm good.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.649
Just trying to keep up.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.893
Cam.
Is that short for Camaro?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.094
Shut... You have
a learning disability, dude.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.763
Excuse him.

23:18.765 --> 23:21.098
- Where you from?
- Queens.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.633
Play any sports
in high school?

23:22.635 --> 23:23.768
Nah, I barely went.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.936
I tried baseball once,

23:25.938 --> 23:29.440
Yeah, I wasn't much of a jock
in high school either.

23:29.442 --> 23:30.941
Look at you.
Hello.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.777
Where'd you do your time?

23:35.181 --> 23:38.716
You're not
the only one in here
with a record.

23:40.886 --> 23:42.453
Abbot House.
Hillside.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.521
Juvi.

23:45.023 --> 23:46.524
Yeah.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.659
Did six months in Otisville
a couple years ago.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.161
Oh shit, what for?

23:50.163 --> 23:52.496
B & E. Boosting cars.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.998
Just bullshit stuff.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.600
You ever go in hard?
Pull some hold ups?

23:56.602 --> 24:00.104
No. I didn't want
to go that way.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.539
Right.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.873
So, what'd you do for money?

24:04.876 --> 24:06.744
I'm a bike messenger.

24:06.746 --> 24:09.547
Fifty points
for the bike messenger.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.982
What do you guys deliver?

24:11.984 --> 24:15.519
Documents.
Just business stuff.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.988
At least,
that's what they tell you.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.557
I don't know.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.025
I mean,
they hand me a package,
I drop it off.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.159
Sure, but it could be
anything, right?

24:22.161 --> 24:23.694
I guess.

24:23.696 --> 24:26.664
You never look
inside the bag?

24:26.666 --> 24:28.199
No.

24:28.201 --> 24:29.201
Never?

24:31.870 --> 24:33.571
No. Why would I do that?

24:33.573 --> 24:36.240
Just curiosity.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.108
It's none of my business.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.070
But you're the one
carrying the package.

24:43.248 --> 24:46.217
Look, as long as
after I drop it off
they pay me my money,

24:46.219 --> 24:48.659
I don't really care
what's inside the bag.

24:54.226 --> 24:57.094
- So what do you guys do?

24:57.096 --> 24:59.056
We do whatever we can
not to get caught.

25:08.206 --> 25:10.841
Heh.
That looks like fun.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.710
They are no limits, my friend.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.713
- Only plateaus.
- Plateaus?

25:17.750 --> 25:19.517
You've got
to constantly push past

25:19.519 --> 25:22.786
what you think you can do
or you stay stuck.

25:22.788 --> 25:25.589
Hmm. I like that one.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.925
What else you got?

25:27.927 --> 25:30.160
Well, how about this?
This whole thing,

25:30.162 --> 25:32.596
parkour, free running, tracing...
whatever you want to call it,

25:32.598 --> 25:34.965
is just a state of mind.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.101
Now the real obstacles
are not out there.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.235
They're in your head.

25:38.237 --> 25:41.105
Okay?

25:41.107 --> 25:43.974
I don't know.
Those obstacles look
pretty real to me.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.176
Well, you're gonna have to start
seeing 'em differently.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.748
Hmm. Got it.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.250
So look where the car isn't.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.785
Exactly.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.624
So, uh, how's that new bike
treating you?

26:00.626 --> 26:02.159
It's good.
Thanks again.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.694
Where is it?

26:03.696 --> 26:05.129
I, uh,
left it at home today.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.330
Liar.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.699
Somebody clipped it.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.834
I didn't want to say anything.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.169
It's all good.
I get it.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.704
You're one of those kind
of people.

26:13.706 --> 26:16.607
What kind of people
is that?

26:16.609 --> 26:19.677
Can't hang on
to anything nice.

26:21.646 --> 26:23.280
I guess I haven't had
enough practice.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.082
Don't worry about it.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.684
I should've known better.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.118
I mean...

26:28.120 --> 26:29.887
Next time
I'll just take my wallet
and burn it.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.957
Hey, Niks! Let's go!

26:32.959 --> 26:34.758
You guys all work together?

26:37.896 --> 26:40.230
See you around, Cam.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.932
Good to meet you, Cam.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.974
Don't let these guys
get you in trouble.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.317
Oh, shit!

27:06.224 --> 27:08.726
Excuse me,
is-is Jerry here?

27:08.728 --> 27:10.194
Jerry?

27:10.196 --> 27:11.996
Back there?

27:11.998 --> 27:13.130
Okay.

27:23.241 --> 27:25.042
Excuse me, Sir.
Is Jerry here?

27:25.044 --> 27:26.377
You just missed him.

27:26.379 --> 27:27.378
Do you know
when he'll be back?

27:27.380 --> 27:29.213
When he returns.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.314
Okay.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.695
Hey!

27:44.697 --> 27:46.997
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hey, Cam.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.966
You didn't tell us
you had such a sweet ride, man.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.234
I have your cash,
right here!

27:50.236 --> 27:52.369
Here.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.138
- There you go, take it.
- All right, man.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.407
We're taking five grand
off your tab for the car,

27:56.409 --> 27:58.676
but you got one month
to get us the rest, all right?

27:58.678 --> 28:00.878
How am I supposed to get
10 grand in a month, Jerry?!

28:00.880 --> 28:02.279
Not my problem, Cam.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.782
Jerry, cut me some slack,
come on.

28:08.286 --> 28:11.455
You still don't understand
how this works, do you?

28:11.457 --> 28:13.190
If you don't pay,
we don't shoot you.

28:18.096 --> 28:19.963
You got one month, Cam.

28:32.410 --> 28:33.944
Go inside the house, Joey.

28:33.946 --> 28:35.446
- Now.
- Joey.

28:35.448 --> 28:38.382
Hey, Angie, I'm sorry.

28:38.384 --> 28:42.753
Your friends
gave Joey a ride home
from school today, Cam.

28:42.755 --> 28:47.291
Those assholes brought
my son home from school.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.927
I don't know
what you're involved in,
and I don't want to know.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.428
Stay away from us.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.996
I mean it.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.249
Oh, hey look who's here.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.418
- Hey, what's up, buddy?
- Are you okay?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.253
I want in.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.189
You are in.

29:20.526 --> 29:21.859
We don't just let
anybody train with us.

29:21.861 --> 29:25.529
No, I'm talking about work.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.831
Whatever you guys got going on
I want in on it.

29:32.904 --> 29:34.238
What's your problem?

29:34.240 --> 29:36.373
What do you guys think,
I'm a narc or something?

29:36.375 --> 29:37.541
Come on.
Hey, Dylan.

29:37.543 --> 29:38.909
I need to talk to Miller.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.911
Hook me up.

29:40.913 --> 29:44.481
No, it's a bad idea.

29:44.483 --> 29:47.851
Why, you know
something I don't?

29:51.956 --> 29:53.557
We're in the
transport business, Cam.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.126
We move valuables.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.930
People hire us
to make obstacles go away,

29:59.932 --> 30:02.172
change hands,
land on someone else.

30:03.434 --> 30:06.834
The difference is
I provide assurances
that other people can't.

30:07.939 --> 30:09.907
I guarantee the work.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.546
You want
some evidence to disappear?

30:15.548 --> 30:17.881
We can take
of that for you.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.021
It's a profession.

30:24.023 --> 30:26.824
We're not thrill seekers who
pull any score that comes along.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.068
The key is speed and silence.
In and out, fast and quiet.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.581
We do our research.
Plan every move.

30:50.583 --> 30:53.217
Work as a team.
Everyone knows their job.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.145
Documents. Chemicals.

31:22.147 --> 31:24.187
Technology. Anything.
We don't take sides.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.600
Now I got just two rules.

31:46.471 --> 31:50.107
The first is,
if you get in trouble,
I'm your first call.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.575
The second,

31:51.577 --> 31:53.143
you stay out of Chinatown.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.312
Even if you're not on a job.

31:55.314 --> 31:56.647
Why is that?

31:56.649 --> 31:59.082
I'm inviting you to sit down
at the dinner table.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.124
Show me you know how
to be a good guest.

32:02.954 --> 32:03.954
Nice work.

32:07.191 --> 32:08.425
Dyl!

34:48.319 --> 34:49.418
Turn around!

34:53.558 --> 34:55.092
Hold on!

34:55.094 --> 34:56.493
- Don't move!
- I'm not.

34:56.495 --> 34:59.463
- Shut up! Shut up!
- I'm not moving!

34:59.465 --> 35:02.299
Who do you work for?

35:02.301 --> 35:04.768
- I said, who do you work for?
- Answer his question!

35:04.770 --> 35:06.303
No one!

35:06.305 --> 35:08.672
What's in the bag?

35:08.674 --> 35:11.141
- Tell me what's in the bag!
- I don't know!

35:11.143 --> 35:12.642
- Give it to me!
- No!

35:12.644 --> 35:14.744
Give it to me!
Give me the bag!

35:18.149 --> 35:20.350
You tell me what's in that bag!

35:20.352 --> 35:22.385
You tell me what's in that bag

35:22.387 --> 35:23.520
or I'm gonna
blow your brains out
right now!

35:23.522 --> 35:25.255
I swear to God!

35:25.257 --> 35:27.390
- What is in the bag!
- I just carry the bag!

35:35.633 --> 35:37.701
Good work, Cam.

35:42.507 --> 35:45.308
What... what's going on?

35:45.310 --> 35:47.444
You pulled some serious
moves out there, pal.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.613
Dude, we heard about the bus.
That was sick!

35:49.615 --> 35:51.915
And you, sir,
you were hauling ass!

35:51.917 --> 35:53.717
Hey, it's all right, buddy.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.218
We just had to make sure
you had our backs.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.687
You're family now.
What do you think?

35:59.257 --> 36:00.891
I think you're a bunch
of assholes.

36:00.893 --> 36:02.626
Especially you.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.959
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.627
Where you taking me?

36:40.765 --> 36:43.466
All right.

36:43.468 --> 36:44.935
Where are the others?

36:44.937 --> 36:46.269
They're busy.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.640
Well...

36:50.642 --> 36:52.442
you want to grab
a coffee or something?

36:52.444 --> 36:53.743
This isn't a date.

36:56.681 --> 37:00.121
I didn't...
I didn't mean it
like a date.

37:00.518 --> 37:01.851
Let's just get this done,
okay?

37:07.725 --> 37:09.559
So how long have you been
Working for Miller?

37:09.561 --> 37:10.694
A few years.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.230
Did you grow up
in the city?

37:13.232 --> 37:15.565
No.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.368
Where'd you learn how
to do parkour?

37:18.370 --> 37:19.703
Here.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.740
You still live with Dylan?

37:23.742 --> 37:25.775
Okay,
enough with the questions, okay?

37:27.979 --> 37:29.479
I'm just trying
to make conversation.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.314
Yeah,
but you wanted to be in.

37:31.316 --> 37:32.616
Guess what?
You're in.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.918
There's nothing left to discuss.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.454
- What's your deal?
- My deal?

37:37.456 --> 37:39.656
- Yeah, what's your deal?
- I don't have a deal.

37:39.658 --> 37:41.625
- Then why are you
acting like this?
- Acting like what?

37:41.627 --> 37:44.494
I-I don't know.
I just thought we could...

37:44.496 --> 37:46.896
I didn't ask
you to come find me.

37:46.898 --> 37:49.399
Really?

37:49.401 --> 37:52.902
You sure about that?
You did give me that bike...

37:52.904 --> 37:55.538
I'm gonna tell Miller you can
work on your own next time.

37:55.540 --> 37:56.906
You don't need
a babysitter.

38:02.313 --> 38:03.780
Okay.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.323
This the new guy?

38:13.325 --> 38:15.525
Yeah.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.327
Good luck, new guy.

38:19.697 --> 38:21.031
Dylan.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.365
Jax.

38:22.367 --> 38:23.700
Nikki.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.035
Tate.

38:25.037 --> 38:26.837
Employee of the month,
Cam.

38:55.366 --> 38:56.700
Angie?

38:59.937 --> 39:02.372
What are you doing here,
Cam? I'm working.

39:02.374 --> 39:03.707
I know.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.775
I brought your rent money.

39:05.777 --> 39:08.945
I don't care
what you brought.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.414
I told you to leave us
alone, right?

39:11.416 --> 39:12.749
Angie...

39:16.954 --> 39:18.455
Angie, please.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.424
Hey, hey.

39:25.796 --> 39:27.931
Please take it.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.366
Okay?

39:31.135 --> 39:33.937
It'll hold you over until you
find somebody else to move in.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.707
This is too much.

39:40.644 --> 39:42.844
What kind of trouble
are you in?

39:47.151 --> 39:50.954
My mom got sick
after she lost her job.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.822
So I borrowed some money
off the street

39:52.824 --> 39:54.791
to try and help her
keep the house.

39:57.495 --> 39:59.396
It wasn't enough.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.965
So the bank foreclosed on her
a week before she died.

40:05.703 --> 40:07.537
You got a good heart, Cam,

40:07.539 --> 40:10.540
but you got to be careful.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.609
Further you go down
the wrong road,

40:12.611 --> 40:15.011
the harder it gets
to find your way back.

40:19.183 --> 40:20.850
I gotta get back to work.

40:22.753 --> 40:25.073
Wait, one sec.
One sec.

40:29.093 --> 40:32.061
Can you give this to Joey?

40:32.063 --> 40:34.731
You don't have
to tell him it's from me.

40:40.571 --> 40:42.572
I'm sorry for everything.

40:42.574 --> 40:43.854
I really am.

40:47.044 --> 40:50.644
I won't bother
you guys again,
I promise.

41:21.545 --> 41:22.679
Hey.

41:24.849 --> 41:27.016
What do you think, man?

41:27.018 --> 41:29.819
Factory paint,
marine grey.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.821
14 inch rally wheels.

41:35.693 --> 41:36.993
You got something for us?

41:43.901 --> 41:47.537
Uh, that's not even
two grand here, man.

41:47.539 --> 41:48.972
I need 10.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.107
Give me a few more weeks
I'll get it to you.

41:51.109 --> 41:53.843
Well, that's past
the deadline, Cam.

41:53.845 --> 41:54.978
I was hoping
we could renegotiate.

41:54.980 --> 41:57.680
Look, I got a new job.

41:57.682 --> 41:58.982
You can raise the vig
if you want to...

41:58.984 --> 42:00.283
Ugh!

42:01.853 --> 42:03.887
You're still acting
like I'm the boss, Cam.

42:03.889 --> 42:06.756
I'm not, all right?
Chen is the boss.

42:06.758 --> 42:09.125
The money you owe me,
I own Chen!

42:12.763 --> 42:15.798
You put me
in a tight spot here, Cam.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.267
Now I don't want
to see anything happen

42:17.269 --> 42:20.970
to your friend
and her little boy, but...

42:20.972 --> 42:24.140
you don't make
this right, it will.

42:24.142 --> 42:25.542
Those are the rules.

42:27.678 --> 42:28.711
Ugh!

42:34.852 --> 42:35.985
Two weeks, Cam.

42:38.689 --> 42:40.023
10 grand.

42:57.875 --> 42:59.842
- Unh.

43:04.148 --> 43:05.848
Yeah?

43:05.850 --> 43:09.719
- We're going out tonight.
- Want to come?

43:09.721 --> 43:11.821
- Work?
- More like play.

43:26.637 --> 43:28.972
Can I get a water?

43:28.974 --> 43:30.940
Hey, what happened here?

43:32.643 --> 43:33.977
- This?
- Yeah.

43:33.979 --> 43:35.845
I biffed a wall trick.

43:35.847 --> 43:38.881
- Oh, how's the wall?

43:38.883 --> 43:41.918
Check this out.
Got it on a broken rail.

43:41.920 --> 43:45.121
- That's nothing man.
- Check this out.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.756
Razor wire.

43:49.126 --> 43:51.027
Dylan, why don't you show them
what happened right here, huh?

43:51.029 --> 43:53.296
- Is that from a curb?
- Nah.

43:53.298 --> 43:54.797
It was a older lady.

43:54.799 --> 43:57.967
He loves the cougar's.
Yeah.

43:57.969 --> 44:00.003
She was a nice girl.

44:00.005 --> 44:01.337
She was Chinese.
She was real smart.

44:01.339 --> 44:03.039
I met her on the subway.

44:03.041 --> 44:06.909
I see her walking down the
street one night with this guy.

44:06.911 --> 44:09.045
I assume it must be her
cousin or something.

44:09.047 --> 44:12.081
So I go up to her,
I give her a big hug and a kiss.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.050
And she freaks out.
Like she's never seen me before.

44:14.052 --> 44:15.752
Goes totally ape shit.

44:15.754 --> 44:18.755
Turns out her cuz'
was her husband.

44:18.757 --> 44:21.391
Yeah, husband,
mixed-martial artist.

44:21.393 --> 44:23.026
Bad news
for the lady killer.

44:23.028 --> 44:25.895
Is that why
we can't cut though Chinatown?

44:25.897 --> 44:27.363
No, that's all Miller,
man.

44:27.365 --> 44:29.365
He's got bad blood
with the gangs there.

44:29.367 --> 44:31.734
- What, the Tongs?
- Yeah.

44:31.736 --> 44:33.369
Yeah,
some business went south.

44:33.371 --> 44:35.931
He had to cut a deal,
promise to stay away.

44:37.374 --> 44:38.875
You know,
Nikki's got some cute marks.

44:38.877 --> 44:41.210
Hey, hey.

44:41.212 --> 44:43.312
I don't know
what he's talking about.

44:43.314 --> 44:45.181
It's not happening.

44:45.183 --> 44:47.183
If I show you,
I'd have to kill ya.

44:47.185 --> 44:49.919
He said it.

44:49.921 --> 44:52.388
There she is!
The future Mrs. Jackson Smith.

44:52.390 --> 44:54.023
- Right there.
- Oh, yeah?

44:54.025 --> 44:55.792
That's gonna be
my future ex-wife.

44:55.794 --> 44:58.227
Yeah, we're gonna move
to the countryside.

44:58.229 --> 45:01.097
Make lots
of sweet ginger babies
every night of the week.

45:01.099 --> 45:02.899
- Oh, that's a terrible visual!
- Then rest of our lives.

45:02.901 --> 45:05.835
- Ugh!
- I know, you're jealous.

45:08.906 --> 45:10.626
You guys know nothing
about women.

46:59.049 --> 47:00.116
Hey.

47:01.218 --> 47:02.552
Hey, Hey.

47:02.554 --> 47:04.420
- What happened?
- Nothing.

47:04.422 --> 47:05.922
It's just stuffy
as hell in there.

47:05.924 --> 47:07.423
That's all.

47:07.425 --> 47:09.392
Do you wanna...
do you wanna
get out of here?

47:09.394 --> 47:10.526
You want to go
somewhere else?

47:10.528 --> 47:13.229
Not right now.
No, I can't.

47:13.231 --> 47:14.897
Hey, what's wrong with you?

47:18.402 --> 47:20.282
Nikki,
what are you afraid of?

47:27.911 --> 47:30.413
Hey, guys.

47:30.415 --> 47:31.914
Sorry I missed the fun.

47:31.916 --> 47:34.450
I had some business
to take care of.

47:34.452 --> 47:35.952
Yeah.

47:43.126 --> 47:44.360
Hey, you okay?

47:44.362 --> 47:47.163
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:47.165 --> 47:49.232
Hey, Cam.

47:49.234 --> 47:51.534
If you need anything at all,
call me.

47:51.536 --> 47:53.202
- All right?
- Yeah.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.394
Coming back in?

48:21.598 --> 48:24.267
No, I'm tired.
I'm...

48:24.269 --> 48:25.401
gonna hit it.

49:34.172 --> 49:35.204
Hey.

49:37.741 --> 49:40.276
What are you doing here?

49:40.278 --> 49:41.477
Wanted to talk to you.

49:46.183 --> 49:47.316
How did you find me?

49:50.087 --> 49:51.387
Why are you living
on the roof?

49:56.093 --> 49:58.613
Why didn't you tell me
you were with Miller?

50:07.704 --> 50:09.605
Dylan got into some trouble.

50:11.742 --> 50:13.576
And Miller made it go away.

50:18.615 --> 50:20.750
So your brother
pimped you out to the boss.

50:20.752 --> 50:22.451
Sounds pretty simple to me.

50:22.453 --> 50:24.373
- Miller doesn't own me.
- Is that right?

50:29.493 --> 50:31.193
Why are you here?

50:31.195 --> 50:32.528
What's the point?

50:32.530 --> 50:35.364
I should have told you.

50:35.366 --> 50:37.033
It's my fault, but...

50:37.035 --> 50:38.367
Cam you wouldn't even
be here if I...

50:38.369 --> 50:40.469
- So you want me to quit?
- You can still walk.

50:40.471 --> 50:41.804
Is that what you want?

50:41.806 --> 50:43.272
I don't want
you to owe Miller
like we do!

50:43.274 --> 50:45.141
Do you want me to go?

50:53.183 --> 50:54.517
No...

51:44.469 --> 51:47.770
I heard once
tattoo's are like scars

51:47.772 --> 51:50.706
that you wear on the outside

51:50.708 --> 51:52.708
to show the pain
that's on the inside.

51:52.710 --> 51:53.876
Is that true?

51:56.580 --> 51:57.860
I don't know.

52:00.250 --> 52:02.785
Why don't you have any?

52:02.787 --> 52:04.753
'Cause I don't want
anyone to know.

52:13.130 --> 52:14.730
I owe people money, Nikki.

52:20.303 --> 52:22.743
And as soon as
I pay them off...

52:24.908 --> 52:26.408
I'm gone.

52:37.455 --> 52:39.288
And this moment
was brought to you by

52:39.290 --> 52:41.423
the sounds of summer
in New York City.

52:43.294 --> 52:45.594
Yeah, we're in a
over-crowded prison.

52:45.596 --> 52:47.296
Uh, I don't really mind it.

52:47.298 --> 52:48.631
- No?
- No.

52:48.633 --> 52:50.166
I mean,
before I left Florida,

52:50.168 --> 52:52.902
I'd never even seen a town
bigger than 500 people.

52:55.305 --> 52:57.306
Well, you're lucky,

52:57.308 --> 53:00.809
'cause all I've ever seen
is this jungle.

53:00.811 --> 53:02.344
You've never been
outside the city?

53:03.914 --> 53:06.882
No.

53:06.884 --> 53:08.884
I mean,
I don't count my jail time.

53:14.724 --> 53:16.392
I tried to leave.

53:16.394 --> 53:19.762
When?

53:19.764 --> 53:21.463
After my mom died.

53:24.968 --> 53:28.737
When she passed away,
I found out that

53:28.739 --> 53:32.274
she had my dad's old car.

53:32.276 --> 53:35.444
And she never told me
while she was alive,

53:35.446 --> 53:36.946
'cause she was afraid
if I found out

53:36.948 --> 53:38.748
I'd sell it to
try and help her out.

53:44.287 --> 53:47.590
So, uh...

53:47.592 --> 53:48.991
she kept it a secret.

53:50.727 --> 53:53.596
She wrote me a letter.

53:53.598 --> 53:55.898
She said she wanted me
to fix it up,

53:55.900 --> 53:58.400
get it running again.

53:58.402 --> 54:01.604
Just hop in and drive.

54:01.606 --> 54:03.305
Somewhere...

54:03.307 --> 54:05.441
I don't know where,
far away.

54:05.443 --> 54:06.909
California maybe.

54:09.279 --> 54:10.913
That was the plan.

54:12.549 --> 54:15.751
Well, where's the car now?

54:18.289 --> 54:20.723
The ahh...

54:20.725 --> 54:22.324
the bank took it.

54:22.326 --> 54:23.993
- The bank?
- Uh-uh.

54:23.995 --> 54:25.527
Oh.

54:29.833 --> 54:31.267
I guess I'm just one
of those people

54:31.269 --> 54:34.303
who can never hold
onto anything nice.

54:34.305 --> 54:36.505
I'll agree with that.

54:36.507 --> 54:37.806
Haha.

55:08.471 --> 55:11.940
Where you been, baby?

55:11.942 --> 55:13.609
I went for a walk.

55:48.345 --> 55:49.645
Anything wrong?

55:49.647 --> 55:51.080
Hmm?

55:51.082 --> 55:53.482
No.

55:53.484 --> 55:55.050
Nothing,
you know I just...

55:55.052 --> 55:57.353
get nervous
before the big jobs.

55:57.355 --> 55:59.655
That's all.

55:59.657 --> 56:01.890
Sure that's all?

56:01.892 --> 56:04.393
You seem kind of distant.

56:04.395 --> 56:06.428
Yeah.

56:06.430 --> 56:08.931
Like you're
somewhere else.

56:08.933 --> 56:11.133
No.

56:11.135 --> 56:12.801
Right here, James.

56:18.808 --> 56:20.888
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

56:24.814 --> 56:26.094
You know that?

56:27.984 --> 56:30.552
I'm just tired.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.588
I'm gonna go to bed.

56:36.626 --> 56:37.906
Sure.

57:17.667 --> 57:18.967
He's getting better.

57:23.940 --> 57:25.474
Nikki and I were living
on the streets

57:25.476 --> 57:26.975
when we found parkour.

57:26.977 --> 57:30.112
We got hooked.
It was like being kids again.

57:30.114 --> 57:33.649
The whole city
is our playground.

57:33.651 --> 57:35.651
Is that where
you met Miller?

57:35.653 --> 57:39.521
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Miller raised us.

57:39.523 --> 57:41.657
Taught us everything we knew,
got us off the streets.

57:41.659 --> 57:43.158
We'd be nowhere without him.

57:43.160 --> 57:46.028
Yeah, Nikki said
that she got you out

57:46.030 --> 57:47.129
of some sort of trouble
or something.

57:47.131 --> 57:48.831
Nikki said that?

57:48.833 --> 57:50.599
Yeah.

57:53.503 --> 57:55.838
What'd she tell you,
exactly?

57:55.840 --> 57:57.606
I mean,
nothing specifically.

57:57.608 --> 58:01.243
Just that you got
in some sort of trouble.

58:01.245 --> 58:03.545
And he made it go away.

58:05.215 --> 58:07.749
But she really cares
about you.

58:07.751 --> 58:10.151
She doesn't want
to see you get hurt.

58:11.020 --> 58:12.488
Are you in some sort
of trouble, Cam?

58:14.090 --> 58:15.824
'Cause if you are,
and Miller finds out,

58:15.826 --> 58:17.793
it's not just you.
That's trouble for all of us.

58:19.562 --> 58:20.829
And he always finds out.

58:22.265 --> 58:24.032
No.

58:24.034 --> 58:25.667
I'm all good.

58:26.903 --> 58:29.838
Good.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.607
I got the last one.

58:33.810 --> 58:34.910
Unit 17 code...

58:47.924 --> 58:48.957
All clear, good job.

58:48.959 --> 58:50.826
Whoo!

58:50.828 --> 58:52.928
That's how we do it!

59:21.224 --> 59:22.624
Wait.

59:22.626 --> 59:24.660
I'll catch up
with you later?

59:24.662 --> 59:26.929
Sure. Talk later.

59:26.931 --> 59:30.098
What do you mean?
Where's our money?

59:30.100 --> 59:33.035
Payday is next week,
Cam, same as usual.

59:33.037 --> 59:35.837
Okay, when's the next
gig happening?

59:35.839 --> 59:36.939
Soon.

59:36.941 --> 59:39.841
Hey, you did a good job.
Get some rest.

59:39.843 --> 59:41.403
You don't understand.
I need that money.

59:42.979 --> 59:44.846
Do we have a problem?

59:44.848 --> 59:46.281
No. No.

59:46.283 --> 59:48.750
No problem.

59:48.752 --> 59:51.320
I've got a big job
coming up next week.

59:51.322 --> 59:53.522
It's worth 15,
20 grand each at least.

59:55.325 --> 59:56.605
Does that work for you guys?

59:57.827 --> 59:59.795
- Sweet. Sounds good.
- Yeah.

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:03.217
How about you, Cam?
Work for you?

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:06.034
Yeah, that works.

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:07.669
Good.

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:35.764
You look just
like your dad.

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:37.099
Yeah, I get that a lot.

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:42.104
It's a nice...

01:00:42.106 --> 01:00:45.207
constant reminder
of the amazing father he was.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:49.978
Well, if it's
any consolation,

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.116
my dad wasn't exactly
a real winner either.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:02.991
Sometimes it's
better not to know.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:03.993
Yeah.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:19.274
You're just going
to leave, aren't you?

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:20.709
You should come with me.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:23.812
Yeah, right.

01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:24.814
Why "yeah, right"?

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:25.815
I can't.

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:27.883
Why not?

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:29.885
It's complicated.

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.293
Well...

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:45.300
I'm not going anywhere
without wheels.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:47.769
Hold on to this for me.

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:55.877
Thank you.

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.225
Nice spot.

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:14.096
I can see all the way
into the future from up here.

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:16.418
Yeah, what happened
to staying in the moment?

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:21.642
You're a good student,
Cam.

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.042
Now you're moving
beyond what you've been taught.

01:02:27.044 --> 01:02:31.046
But outside there's
a natural order to things.

01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:35.083
You know, there can be
only one alpha for every pack.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.152
And that my friend,
I learned the hard way.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:38.520
A long time ago.

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.956
In the back
of a Chinese restaurant,

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:43.438
trying to beg for my life
with a gun in my mouth.

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:49.110
Is there something
you need to tell me, Cam?

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.334
There's nothing.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.051
You sure?

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:58.974
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:06.381
You should get
some plants up here.

01:03:06.383 --> 01:03:07.916
Liven this place up a bit.

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:10.952
Pickup tomorrow at 9:30.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:27.068
Hey guys.

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:29.471
Where's Nikki?

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.507
Gave her the day off.

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:39.581
Two minutes.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:41.583
You'll be needing this.

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:49.024
Wait, we're
going in strong?

01:03:49.026 --> 01:03:50.892
I told you
it was big, my friend.

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:51.927
You're gonna
get a cut.

01:03:51.929 --> 01:03:53.649
Twenty grand each.
Maybe more.

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.199
I didn't sign up for this.

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:01.469
Okay,
it's up here on the corner.

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.174
We're doing a bank?

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:11.313
Old bank. New money.

01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:12.315
BTK bought it.

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:13.849
BTK?

01:04:13.851 --> 01:04:15.150
Vietnamese bangers.

01:04:15.152 --> 01:04:16.451
This is their laundromat.

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:18.420
They keep a big stack,
couple hundred K.

01:04:18.422 --> 01:04:20.155
How do you know all this?

01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:21.223
That's my job.

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.479
How we getting
in this thing?

01:04:25.294 --> 01:04:27.562
The front door.

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:28.597
What?

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:31.867
You're risking
a lot here, man.

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:33.629
Tell your man
to make this look good.

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:36.972
Okay, game time.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.174
Who's got my piece?

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:43.011
You're carrying
the package.

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:45.046
You'll be all right.
We've done this before.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.882
We don't even shoot
these things.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:48.724
Be safe, kids,
stay out of trouble.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.627
Masks!

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:19.581
Hand off the gun!

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:23.285
Toss him the gun!

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:25.420
Toss him the gun!

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:29.357
You deaf?
Toss him the gun!

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.069
You don't like
to listen, huh?

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:38.133
Get on the ground!

01:05:41.038 --> 01:05:46.441
Get on the ground!
You deaf? Get on the floor!

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:50.612
We got to get moving!

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.155
What... what's
the combination?!

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:01.256
Answer him!

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:10.131
Tell me how we get inside!

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:12.600
You think this is funny?!

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:14.369
Tell me what the combo is!

01:06:14.371 --> 01:06:16.037
What, is everybody deaf
and dumb here?

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:17.079
Answer his question!

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:22.110
What's the combination?!

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.492
I don't have it.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:27.462
Is there another way in?

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:30.732
Yo, come on!

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:34.402
I can get in.

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:36.124
What the hell
are you doing?

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:38.686
I can't see shit
with this thing!

01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:56.579
We got to move, guys!

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.280
There's nothing.
It's empty!

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:01.082
- Check again!
- With nothing!

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:04.486
Where's the money?!

01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:05.768
I don't know, dude.
I don't know.

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:08.423
What are you
laughing at, big guy?!

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:09.425
They picked it up early.

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:13.161
But he wouldn't
have known that.

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:15.130
Would you?

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:17.232
Would you?

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:18.133
Dude, let's just go!

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:19.434
You're dead.

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:20.535
Back up!

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.390
A-ha!

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.232
Where you going,
little bitch?

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:50.565
Go! Go! Go!

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.634
You better run!

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:22.229
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:35.743
Back! Back! Back!

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:42.777
Come on! Come on!

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:17.879
Freeze! Stay down!

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:20.481
Put your hands up
where I can see them, now!

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:24.686
Stay right there,
get down!

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:44.405
How about your dead buddy,
huh? Does he got a name?

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:45.873
I don't know, might be nice
to let his family know

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.575
where to pick up
his remains.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.577
He doesn't have any family.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.512
What the hell did you do
to get half the BTK

01:10:51.514 --> 01:10:53.348
to chase your little asses
down the street?

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:56.351
Look, if you had anything
real to charge me with

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:57.485
you wouldn't
be asking.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.860
The Feds would like
a word with you.

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:07.362
Ooh!

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:10.945
Have fun, kid.

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:17.672
Miller?

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:18.674
No sudden moves, okay?

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:22.610
James Hatcher.
I'm with the DEA.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.712
You thought jumping a 20-foot
gap, five stories up was a rush?

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:28.283
Just breathe for me, Cam, okay?
We don't have much time.

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:31.319
Where's Dylan and Tate?

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:32.487
They're in the van
on the way home.

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:33.454
They should be hitting
the tunnel by now.

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:34.456
Do they know about this?

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.857
Cam, they all know.

01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:37.592
How the hell do you think
I ran this circus?

01:11:37.594 --> 01:11:39.294
Miller's a man on the ground,
shipping and receiving,

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:40.862
HR, transpo.

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:42.297
Hatcher's upstairs...
due diligence,

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.866
Neither one
of them gets much sleep,

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:45.967
but they work
well together.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:47.502
You got to be kidding me.

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:49.370
I've been working
for a dirty Fed this whole time?

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:51.772
Yeah, or a clean criminal.
Depends on your point of view.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:54.876
What about Jax, huh?

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.716
Look, I got bad intel
on this one.

01:12:01.718 --> 01:12:04.352
Okay, and Jax is gone.

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:06.521
But that's the past.
All we have is the moment.

01:12:06.523 --> 01:12:07.722
And right now,
in this moment,

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:09.090
New York P.D. thinks
you're one of my CI's.

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:10.758
That means you get
to walk out of here with me,

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.627
right now,
under my protection.

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:13.628
Yeah, so they
can find my body

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:14.996
in a dumpster tomorrow
morning?

01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:16.964
No, thank you!

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:18.833
Cam, I'm not going to hurt you.
I need your help.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.768
The cops are rousting
the whole gang.

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:22.337
Sooner or later someone
is going to talk themselves

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:24.259
out of trouble
and that will lead back to me.

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:26.974
It's time for me
to cash out.

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:29.911
Is this your
"one last score" speech?

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:31.012
Save it.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:32.480
It's my exit plan.

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:33.881
But I cannot do it
without your help.

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:37.118
If you want me,
I need my 10 grand, today.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.354
Right now.
Then we'll talk.

01:12:39.356 --> 01:12:40.955
That's not going
to happen.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.056
Fine.

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:43.524
Then I'm not helping you.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.727
All right. I'm out.

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:52.767
The thing is, Cam, it's not
just about you anymore, is it?

01:12:52.769 --> 01:12:55.436
Because you became
part of a family.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:58.673
So you have to think
about the welfare of others.

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:04.912
Where is she?

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:07.548
I don't want
Nikki mixed up in this anymore.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.650
So you and I are going
to finish this.

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:34.008
Hey!

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:37.712
Why didn't you tell me? Hmm?

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:38.980
I told you to get out.

01:13:38.982 --> 01:13:40.014
You played me
from the start.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:41.416
No.

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:42.417
The bike,
that was all bullshit?

01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:43.419
- No.
- This has been

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:44.420
a set-up the whole time?

01:13:44.421 --> 01:13:45.701
Cam, I swear it.
That was all me!

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:50.892
I felt bad
for wrecking you out.

01:13:50.894 --> 01:13:52.627
I wanted
to get you a new one.

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:54.162
I didn't think all of this
was going to happen.

01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:56.404
Well, then,
what did you think?

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:00.468
You wanted in, Cam.

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:03.137
No. I wanted you.

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:08.176
I'm sorry.

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:08.976
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you.

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:10.478
I did!

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.214
But... I couldn't.

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:14.216
Why not?

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:15.783
Because of Dylan.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:18.052
What do you mean
because of Dylan?

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:20.922
That you couldn't tell me
this whole time?

01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:21.924
He...

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.794
You know, Dylan is your
older brother, Nikki.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.062
You don't need
to babysit him.

01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:30.665
You can let him deal
with his own problems.

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:32.967
Somebody did
something to me, okay.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.969
Back in Florida.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:38.239
Some scumbag came
into my bedroom late at night.

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:40.041
He started touching me.

01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:43.478
Dylan walked in
and he beat him into a coma.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.812
The cops came after us.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:46.180
They chased us all the way
over here.

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:48.216
And then I met Miller.

01:14:48.218 --> 01:14:52.954
And Miller made it
all go away.

01:14:52.956 --> 01:14:55.723
Dylan was there
that night to protect me.

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:57.758
And now it's my job
to protect him.

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:01.662
Cam, I was scared
to tell you anything else.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:05.233
Because I didn't want
you to go.

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:20.915
Look...

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:22.877
if I can get
us a clean exit tomorrow...

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:26.854
will you come with me?

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:32.059
Miller's not going
to let us just walk away.

01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:34.128
Do you wanna leave Miller
or not, Nikki?

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:06.694
I told you
what could happen to Dylan,

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:10.164
to us, if anything
ever went wrong.

01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:13.601
Do you remember?

01:16:13.603 --> 01:16:15.036
- Yeah.
- What?

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:16.604
Yes!

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:24.745
I'm getting us
out of this life.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:27.214
And we're going
to start over.

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:30.051
Just you and me
this time.

01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:34.288
Okay?

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:17.298
Where we going?

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.165
The guys and I got
a plane to catch

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:19.967
when we're done.

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:22.903
We'll drop you
on the way to the airport.

01:17:22.905 --> 01:17:26.073
After you get your 10 grand,
of course.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:29.143
Here. Put these on.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.779
Let's go.

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:41.187
Nikki and Tate will lookout
while we make the pickup, okay.

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:12.953
Where are we?

01:18:12.955 --> 01:18:18.259
Russians keep their VIP's here,
They stash other stuff too.

01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:19.326
Well, what do you
need me for?

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:21.462
It's a two-man job.

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:22.863
Why can't Dylan go in...

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:24.465
Dylan's watching our exit.

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.869
How are we getting in?
Through the skylight?

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:31.405
Copy that.

01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:32.473
What's inside there?

01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:34.008
New plateau, my friend.

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:40.047
It's not loaded.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:44.151
You want me to go
in unarmed?

01:18:44.153 --> 01:18:45.186
I'm going in with you.

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:46.420
It's you and me together
this time.

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:48.456
All right?

01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:52.126
You're really down
with this, Dylan?

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:54.929
How about you just do
your job, all right?

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:58.966
Hey, get your head
in it, Cam. Right now.

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:00.801
We're doing this for Nikki.

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:01.869
Remember?

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:04.505
Pull over.

01:19:04.507 --> 01:19:05.507
Why?

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:08.476
'Cause I gotta
take a piss.

01:19:08.478 --> 01:19:10.478
Tate! Come on!

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.079
- I can't.
- What?

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:13.081
Come on, Nikki.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.402
Everybody knows
about you and Cam.

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:17.818
Stop the van, Tate.

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.353
- No.
- Pull over!

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:21.288
Just shut up already!

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:25.572
Pull the fuck over!

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:32.933
Once we're inside, just
do everything I say.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.535
I've got this all
worked out.

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:35.537
Sure landing.

01:19:35.538 --> 01:19:37.104
On three.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:38.106
Ready?

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:42.176
One, two, three.

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:47.014
Be quiet!

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:48.096
Don't move! Don't move!

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:50.217
Sit! Sit down!

01:19:57.826 --> 01:20:00.127
- What's going on!
- Watch them!

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:01.409
Don't move!

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:16.857
What's the exit plan?!

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:23.250
Huh?

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:32.459
This is the exit plan, Cam.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:10.064
Dylan, what are you doing!

01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:11.065
- Don't... don't move!
- Dylan...

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:14.034
Do it! He's got
the diamonds!

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:15.202
Dylan...

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:16.204
Dylan, put the gun down!

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.205
Don't move!

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.481
All units, 10-10.

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:03.284
Shots fired at 231 West 23rd.

01:22:03.286 --> 01:22:04.985
Repeat, shots fired.

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:47.087
DEA, I'm taking your car!

01:23:47.089 --> 01:23:48.455
No!

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.401
Nikki! Are you okay?!

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:36.103
- Huh? Yeah. I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

01:24:36.105 --> 01:24:37.385
Come on, come on, come on.

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.409
Come on!

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:06.266
This way!

01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:08.535
No, no, no!

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:22.416
I'm done!

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.453
Move away, Nikki,
I don't want to hurt you!

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:34.060
I'm not going to ask you
again, baby. Move away.

01:25:46.609 --> 01:25:48.842
Agent Hatcher.

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:50.310
Chen?

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:51.478
James...

01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:02.489
Okay, listen.
I can explain.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:03.757
There's been a mistake.

01:26:03.759 --> 01:26:05.459
There has.

01:26:05.461 --> 01:26:06.527
You made it.

01:26:06.529 --> 01:26:07.828
I believe
it was rule number two.

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:10.731
Stay out of Chinatown.

01:26:13.202 --> 01:26:17.871
Watch your language!
You're in Chen's house now.

01:26:17.873 --> 01:26:20.941
I told you long time ago
to keep your business

01:26:20.943 --> 01:26:22.643
out of my neighborhood.

01:26:22.645 --> 01:26:23.944
And I did, Chen, I did.

01:26:23.946 --> 01:26:25.245
But this is personal.

01:26:25.247 --> 01:26:26.847
So is this.

01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:28.248
You've been making too
much trouble

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.483
for too many of my friends.

01:26:29.485 --> 01:26:30.485
Okay.

01:26:30.486 --> 01:26:33.187
Chen, listen to me,
please...

01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:36.557
There is a boat leaving
for Macau in two hours.

01:26:36.559 --> 01:26:38.725
Mr. Hu will make sure
you're on it.

01:26:38.727 --> 01:26:39.727
Time to close you out.

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.930
You're dead,
both of you.

01:26:53.908 --> 01:26:55.188
You're dead.

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:06.587
But enough about him.
You have something for me?

01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:26.974
If I were you,

01:27:26.976 --> 01:27:29.243
I'd seriously consider
leaving town.

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:33.847
Congratulations.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:36.750
Your debt is clear.

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:43.323
That's it?

01:27:43.325 --> 01:27:46.026
We're all done.

01:27:46.028 --> 01:27:48.428
Wait.

01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:52.633
What about our deal?

01:28:13.022 --> 01:28:14.321
Where to?

01:28:14.323 --> 01:28:16.723
Let's just drive.
