00:31.708 --> 00:35.725
Both poles of our planet are covered with ice.

00:36.061 --> 00:41.012
They're the largest and most demanding
wildernesses of all.

00:42.782 --> 00:47.494
Nowhere else on Earth
is seasonal change so extreme.

00:47.757 --> 00:53.568
It causes the ice to advance
and retreat every year

00:54.621 --> 00:59.165
and all life here is governed by that.

01:17.128 --> 01:20.835
When the first polar explorers headed south

01:20.931 --> 01:27.245
giant cathedrals of ice marked their entry
into uncharted territory.

01:31.407 --> 01:38.247
Passing the towering spires they must've wondered
what unearthly sights lay in store.

01:42.481 --> 01:46.619
As they battled on
the ice became increasingly dominant

01:46.738 --> 01:53.818
but nothing could have prepared them
for the ice world that finally loomed into view.

01:58.984 --> 02:04.007
Terra incognita - the unknown land.

02:16.134 --> 02:20.989
At the southernmost extreme of our planet
the continent of Antarctica

02:21.085 --> 02:24.648
is as large as the United States of America.

02:31.011 --> 02:35.650
90 percent of all the world's ice
is found here.

02:38.330 --> 02:45.601
This frozen world is largely deserted
until the start of spring.

02:50.073 --> 02:52.179
Adelie penguins

02:52.944 --> 02:55.097
in a hurry.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.917
The clock is ticking.

03:03.156 --> 03:09.830
Instead of waiting for the summer melt
the new arrivals hasten south over the frozen sea.

03:21.789 --> 03:26.238
They have come here to breed
but polar summers are so short

03:26.429 --> 03:30.902
they must be in position
before the thaw starts.

03:35.733 --> 03:41.044
As the sea ice retreats
life can journey farther south.

03:46.974 --> 03:54.318
Antarctic waters are so rich
that visitors come from far and wide to harvest them.

04:01.660 --> 04:07.520
Vast numbers of chinstrap penguins
come ashore to breed.

04:15.415 --> 04:19.529
No bird will lay their eggs
directly onto ice

04:19.625 --> 04:26.752
so bare rock is a vital commodity.
The best patches are worth the climb.

04:31.463 --> 04:39.165
The clifftops are soon stained pink with the droppings
of tens of thousands of nesting penguins.

04:47.585 --> 04:55.574
Only in a land almost entirely covered in ice
could bare rock be reckoned an oasis.

04:57.367 --> 05:02.031
Some will travel into the heart
of the continent to find it.

05:03.706 --> 05:13.727
These are noon attacks the exposed peaks
of vast mountain ranges buried in ice over a mile deep.

05:15.306 --> 05:20.807
The eerie silence here
is only broken in spring.

05:27.552 --> 05:31.952
The snow petrels have arrived
and are courting.

05:39.204 --> 05:44.873
Antarctic petrels now join
the most southerly colony on Earth.

05:46.361 --> 05:49.909
The birds have flown inland
for over three hundred miles

05:49.930 --> 05:52.520
to reach this breeding site.

05:57.250 --> 06:02.899
Once their eggs have hatched they'll be forced
repeatedly to make the 600 mile round trip

06:02.919 --> 06:05.039
to gather food in the ocean.

06:07.323 --> 06:13.297
First though valuable nesting places
must be defended from property thieves.

06:20.230 --> 06:25.939
After laying their eggs the petrels
take time out to clean their plumage.

06:47.196 --> 06:52.188
The south polar skua is a formidable opportunist

06:55.666 --> 06:59.121
but the skuas have not chanced upon the petrels

06:59.594 --> 07:02.362
they've been waiting for them.

07:05.746 --> 07:11.070
These birds do not need to go to the ocean
for their food.

07:28.371 --> 07:32.689
The skuas can survive further south
than any other predator

07:32.690 --> 07:37.362
by exploiting the petrels' desperate need
for bare rock.

07:48.069 --> 07:53.599
Even at the height of summer
less than 3% of Antarctica is free of ice

07:53.659 --> 07:58.421
and nearly all of that
exposed rock is found in one place

07:58.775 --> 08:01.467
the Antarctic Peninsula.

08:07.885 --> 08:15.309
It's long arm extends further north than
the rest of the continent, so spring arrives here first.

08:29.564 --> 08:32.847
The thaw unlocks sheltered bays

08:32.847 --> 08:38.585
that provide refuge from the relentless battering
of the southern ocean.

08:42.429 --> 08:46.896
In the depths something stirs...

09:10.887 --> 09:12.969
Humpback whales.

09:13.017 --> 09:18.530
They have travelled over 5000 miles
to reach these waters.

09:24.943 --> 09:27.758
The whales are harvesting krill

09:27.805 --> 09:33.721
shrimp like creatures that begin to swarm here
as soon as the ice retreats.

09:47.909 --> 09:50.464
Diving into the heart of the swarm

09:50.606 --> 09:55.978
teams of whales spiral around each other
in close coordination.

09:58.864 --> 10:05.252
Now they turn and blasting air from their blowholes
and ascend towards their prey.

10:06.884 --> 10:12.871
The krill becomes concentrated
as the spiralling net of bubbles draws inwards.

10:40.481 --> 10:45.569
The team of whales work around the clock
for the bloom is short lived.

10:45.733 --> 10:53.305
Summer is already fading and the whales
will soon be forced north as winter returns.

10:56.429 --> 11:01.776
The sun's influence diminishes
and the ocean starts to freeze.

11:02.024 --> 11:07.732
The greatest seasonal change
on our planet is underway.

11:12.434 --> 11:18.319
The ice grows at an extraordinary rate
advancing two and a half miles a day.

11:18.585 --> 11:24.176
In a matter of weeks
the continent effectively doubles in size.

11:27.133 --> 11:31.007
Life flees from Antarctica...

11:37.011 --> 11:40.265
but one creature is just arriving.

11:45.116 --> 11:53.841
Every winter Emperor penguins leave the comfort
of their ocean home and begin a remarkable journey.

11:55.320 --> 12:01.679
They head towards their breeding grounds
almost a hundred miles inland.

12:24.258 --> 12:28.896
Eventually the emperor penguins reach
the place where they were hatched

12:29.085 --> 12:33.746
an area sheltered by icebergs
trapped in the frozen ocean.

12:34.881 --> 12:38.408
Here they will raise the next generation

12:44.843 --> 12:48.297
but first each must find a mate.

12:51.207 --> 12:54.472
Males begin to serenade

12:58.423 --> 13:04.598
and if a female replies
they pair up, posing like statues.

13:08.479 --> 13:11.886
New couples quickly form a strong bond

13:11.981 --> 13:16.453
they seem oblivious to the noisy crowd
around them.

13:18.368 --> 13:23.598
To cement their relationship
the male steps out with his female.

13:33.488 --> 13:38.197
The brief courtship complete
there isn't a moment to loose.

13:38.268 --> 13:44.065
With so much pressure to perform
any male would struggle to stay on top.

13:51.850 --> 13:56.984
Several weeks later and it seems
that most couplings were successful

13:57.907 --> 14:02.024
but producing the egg
has taken it's toll.

14:02.338 --> 14:06.219
The females no longer have the energy
to incubate.

14:08.111 --> 14:09.981
The male takes over.

14:10.265 --> 14:17.741
It's still minus 20 degrees centigrade, so the transfer
must be done quickly or else the egg will freeze.

14:17.907 --> 14:23.183
With no bare rock to nest on
the male tucks the egg into a special pouch

14:23.278 --> 14:25.431
where he can keep it warm.

14:26.141 --> 14:29.856
It requires an extraordinary piece of teamwork.

14:34.186 --> 14:40.007
Driven by hunger, the exhausted females now
return to the ocean on their own

14:40.220 --> 14:46.064
repeating the epic journey they made
with the males only a month before.

14:51.671 --> 14:55.646
Now the sun barely appears above the horizon.

14:56.308 --> 15:01.751
As the day shortens, it's warmth
is withdrawn from the continent.

15:12.657 --> 15:18.549
With the females gone
the colony undergoes a strange transformation.

15:19.140 --> 15:25.671
The males shuffle into groups,
their eggs still tucked away above their feet.

15:27.990 --> 15:33.811
They lock together in tightly packed huddles
as they struggle to keep warm.

15:37.550 --> 15:42.708
Speeding up the action reveals how
these huddles constantly shift and change

15:42.709 --> 15:48.316
as each penguin works it's way
towards the warmer interior.

15:49.121 --> 15:55.153
Crammed into this scrum, the birds
are remarkably good natured, but they have to be.

15:55.343 --> 16:00.904
If the huddle breaks even for a moment,
precious heat escapes.

16:19.075 --> 16:23.192
It's imperative they reform
as quickly as possible

16:23.334 --> 16:30.361
for only by as acting as one can the males
withstand the elements, and protect their eggs.

16:35.164 --> 16:38.808
But their greatest test lies ahead.

16:39.234 --> 16:44.558
As winter advances, frequent blizzards
drive the temperature down.

16:45.126 --> 16:50.237
It's now 60 degrees below zero.

16:51.987 --> 16:54.400
The birds at the edge of the huddle

16:54.471 --> 16:57.334
bear the brunt of the hundred mile an hour winds

16:57.524 --> 17:02.587
and so provide shelter
to those taking their turn in the middle.

17:10.916 --> 17:15.318
Abandoned by the sun
the males are left alone with their eggs

17:15.319 --> 17:20.547
to face the coldest darkest winter on Earth.

17:27.290 --> 17:30.271
At the northern extreme of our planet

17:30.294 --> 17:38.267
the sun rises for the first time in months,
illuminating a very different ice world.

17:40.514 --> 17:48.298
Unlike Antarctica, the Arctic is a vast frozen sea
surrounded by land.

17:49.695 --> 17:52.913
Here winter is coming to an end

17:53.244 --> 17:59.113
but this bleak wilderness
remains locked in ice.

18:05.643 --> 18:08.695
Eider ducks break the silence.

18:08.860 --> 18:16.290
They have stayed here braving the northern winter,
instead of flying south to warmer climes.

18:19.461 --> 18:25.613
Flocks forty thousand strong
sweep across the frozen wastes.

18:38.745 --> 18:41.323
They all have the same goal

18:41.395 --> 18:49.700
a polinear, a permanent hole in the sea ice
kept open throughout the winter by strong ocean currents.

18:53.226 --> 18:58.077
This unusual duck pond
provides an overnight sanctuary

18:58.124 --> 19:02.596
and when day breaks
a rare chance to feed.

19:14.662 --> 19:22.091
Just ten meters beneath the ice, the sea floor
is carpeted with dense mussel beds.

19:23.345 --> 19:27.486
These can only be reached
during a brief lull in the currents.

19:27.629 --> 19:34.325
The ducks must quickly prise the mussels free
before the tide starts to turn.

19:40.524 --> 19:43.198
The window of opportunity is short.

19:43.386 --> 19:48.734
As the current begins to build
it's up up and away.

19:59.879 --> 20:06.291
These permanent holes in the ice
provide seafood throughout winter.

20:07.663 --> 20:10.361
The diners attract others.

20:16.702 --> 20:22.097
In the Arctic, any breach in the icy barrier
can be a lifeline.

20:26.119 --> 20:28.461
Musk oxen create their own.

20:29.928 --> 20:34.282
These giants have the strength
to smash through the frozen crust

20:34.400 --> 20:37.453
to graze on the vegetation below.

20:41.522 --> 20:46.704
These icebreakers create an opening
for other over winterers.

20:47.626 --> 20:52.926
Flocks of ptarmigan make unusual
grazing companions for the musk oxen

20:53.234 --> 20:56.145
whose entourage grows throughout the day.

21:05.159 --> 21:10.577
This odd assembly of vegetarians
doesn't go unnoticed.

21:11.358 --> 21:13.204
An arctic fox.

21:18.669 --> 21:22.431
The musk oxen have recently given birth.

21:22.857 --> 21:26.737
For the fox,
it's a chance to scavenge

21:33.409 --> 21:39.205
but half a ton of mad hairy cow
is not to be trifled with.

21:48.457 --> 21:51.605
The calves are born well before the spring melt

21:51.606 --> 21:57.046
giving them a head start
when summer finally arrives.

22:00.193 --> 22:03.766
It must get to grips with it's new ice world

22:04.214 --> 22:08.355
benign one minute
life threatening the next.

22:14.318 --> 22:18.434
Even in spring
winds chill to the bone.

22:21.464 --> 22:27.355
The calf must stay close to it's mother
to avoid getting lost in the sudden blizzard.

22:36.953 --> 22:39.566
Arctic wolves.

22:43.162 --> 22:47.231
In the whiteout,
the threat is almost impossible to detect

22:47.325 --> 22:51.603
but the musk oxen instinctively retreat
to higher ground.

23:07.295 --> 23:10.702
Forming a defensive ring around their calves

23:10.779 --> 23:15.113
the adults present a barricade
that few hunters could breach

23:17.517 --> 23:21.454
but the wolves need not risk injury today.

23:23.290 --> 23:27.208
A calf has been left behind in the panic.

23:40.078 --> 23:44.735
With each passing day
the sun climbs higher in the sky

23:44.887 --> 23:48.634
and it's rays strike the Arctic more directly.

23:49.524 --> 23:54.237
It's spring and new life stirs.

23:58.117 --> 24:02.528
The polar bear cubs emerge from the den
in which they were born.

24:02.925 --> 24:08.642
Their mother stretches her legs
after five months under the snow.

24:13.393 --> 24:15.362
They're just two months old

24:15.716 --> 24:19.265
and instinctively follow her lead.

24:34.550 --> 24:38.170
A steep slope makes the best site for a den

24:38.265 --> 24:42.925
but it's a tricky place to take your first steps.

25:01.687 --> 25:07.271
It may look like fun, but this
is serious training for the task ahead.

25:07.461 --> 25:09.401
There's no food on the slopes

25:09.402 --> 25:16.073
and the family will need to head out
across the frozen sea, before the mother's milk runs dry.

25:22.486 --> 25:25.869
Two weeks later
they're ready.

25:26.578 --> 25:30.790
Out on the sea ice
the female can hunt for seals

25:30.955 --> 25:35.261
but it will take all her mothering skills
to keep her cubs safe

25:35.451 --> 25:39.023
in this dangerous world of ice.

25:53.854 --> 25:57.593
The annual melt has begun.

25:58.822 --> 26:02.490
This is a challenging time
for the bear family.

26:02.774 --> 26:09.233
One out of every two cubs do not survive
their first year out on the ice.

26:19.739 --> 26:25.985
As the sun's influence increases, the sea ice
seems to take on a life of it's own.

26:34.196 --> 26:37.177
Glacial melt waters pour from the land

26:37.367 --> 26:41.531
mingling with the sea
and speeding up the thaw.

26:46.454 --> 26:54.024
The seascape is in constant flux,
as broken ice is moved on by winds and currents.

27:02.847 --> 27:09.188
The ice is becoming too weak
to support a male polar bear.

27:16.334 --> 27:19.126
He attempts to spread his weight

27:19.221 --> 27:24.710
but the ice that has supported him all winter
is rapidly disintegrating.

27:26.484 --> 27:31.454
Each year as the climate warms
the Arctic holds less ice.

27:31.666 --> 27:34.813
This is a disaster for polar bears.

27:34.860 --> 27:41.675
Without it's solid platform, they can't hunt
the seals they need in order to survive.

27:44.300 --> 27:47.897
This may be a glimpse of the unstable future

27:47.898 --> 27:51.304
faced by this magnificent creature.

28:24.807 --> 28:30.793
As the ice disappears
seabirds return to the high Arctic.

28:38.767 --> 28:42.790
Little auks arrive in their millions.

28:44.825 --> 28:49.178
In some ways these birds
are the penguins of the north.

28:49.226 --> 28:55.188
The seek bare rock on which to lay their eggs
and they look rather like penguins too.

29:01.245 --> 29:06.640
Unlike Antarctica, the Arctic
can be reached by land based predators

29:06.665 --> 29:11.066
which is why little auks have kept
the ability to fly.

29:15.939 --> 29:23.037
They use scree slopes to protect their eggs,
burrowing up to a meter beneath the rocks.

29:29.213 --> 29:32.596
At the height of summer the sun never sets

29:32.597 --> 29:36.856
but just skims the horizon before rising again.

29:42.297 --> 29:47.053
Migrants return to the Arctic
from far and wide.

29:47.479 --> 29:50.863
They've come to make the most
of the brief flush of food

29:51.006 --> 29:53.229
and to produce their young.

29:54.743 --> 30:00.091
Sandhill cranes have travelled all the way
from New Mexico.

30:05.154 --> 30:11.330
Their chicks join the growing band of youngsters
exploring the tundra.

30:17.979 --> 30:23.894
For a few months each year the Arctic
becomes the land of the midnight sun

30:24.155 --> 30:29.762
and twenty four hours of daylight
allow animals to feed around the clock.

30:31.134 --> 30:37.239
The arctic fox finally has enough food
to raise her large family.

30:52.150 --> 30:57.474
If you choose to nest in the open
you must be prepared for a fight.

31:06.229 --> 31:12.451
Arctic skuas will see off any trespassers
even large vegetarians.

31:58.567 --> 32:05.192
The male polar bear's ice world
has finally vanished beneath him.

32:16.337 --> 32:21.329
While the female is still kept on land
by her dependent cubs

32:21.376 --> 32:25.091
the male can take to the sea
in search of food.

32:25.257 --> 32:32.829
Ducking and diving, he hopes to ambush seals
resting on the remaining fragments of ice.

32:59.494 --> 33:05.741
In these new surroundings
he is a surprisingly adept swimmer.

33:15.986 --> 33:18.802
Once an extremely rare sight

33:18.803 --> 33:24.480
polar bears have recently been seen
over sixty miles from the shore.

33:37.919 --> 33:41.942
There is now no turning back for this bear.

33:42.202 --> 33:46.815
He's forced to head out into deeper water.

33:53.890 --> 33:59.498
His giant front paws
help him to fight the ocean currents.

34:20.199 --> 34:26.092
He seems at home in the sea
but he cannot swim indefinitely.

34:29.096 --> 34:35.152
He will drown if he doesn't find land
somewhere in this vast ocean.

35:02.741 --> 35:07.025
Walruses are now gathering
on low lying islands.

35:07.427 --> 35:09.888
They gave birth on sea ice

35:09.889 --> 35:16.701
but with this platform now gone, they need
a new place to haul out and nurse their young.

35:18.594 --> 35:23.800
After several days at sea
the male bear finally makes landfall

35:23.895 --> 35:29.030
drawn by pungent smells
emanating from the island.

35:36.743 --> 35:41.191
By the end of summer
the bear has lost half his weight.

35:41.499 --> 35:47.414
With the ice long gone
he is forced onto land in search of food.

35:56.239 --> 35:59.930
There will be no easy meals on this island.

36:00.402 --> 36:05.182
Walruses are the largest seals in the world.
They weight over a ton

36:05.230 --> 36:08.637
and are armed with tusks a meter long.

36:11.594 --> 36:17.012
Exhausted from his swim
the bear must regain his strength.

36:23.495 --> 36:27.516
The next day a sea fog shrouds the island.

36:27.753 --> 36:31.279
The walruses sense that they're in danger.

36:33.977 --> 36:38.804
Using the fog as cover
the bear approaches the herd.

36:43.560 --> 36:50.421
The adults close ranks around their young,
presenting a wall of blubber and hide.

37:00.429 --> 37:02.796
He tests the barrier but it stands firm.

37:03.741 --> 37:09.136
It appears that the world's largest
land carnivore has met his match.

37:16.849 --> 37:19.523
There must be a chink in the armor somewhere.

37:23.924 --> 37:25.177
Not here.

37:34.383 --> 37:39.801
This female walrus is shielding her pup,
if can just prise her off.

37:47.066 --> 37:51.940
The bears claws and teeth can't penetrate
her thick hide.

38:00.599 --> 38:05.261
With the herd retreating to water
the bear must move quickly.

38:10.442 --> 38:14.394
Having failed with one
he heads straight for another.

38:31.999 --> 38:36.589
The chance of his first meal in months
is slipping away.

38:43.639 --> 38:45.934
He seems increasingly desperate.

38:52.158 --> 38:54.216
It's now or never.

38:55.163 --> 38:59.280
He must avoid the stabbing tusks
if he's to win.

39:06.165 --> 39:11.892
The flailing walrus is immensely powerful
and drags the bear away from the shallows

39:11.986 --> 39:14.470
towards the safety of the herd.

39:30.275 --> 39:32.877
It slips from his grasp.

39:41.207 --> 39:45.916
Only at the height of summer
when bears are on the verge of starvation

39:46.199 --> 39:50.174
will they risk attacking such dangerous prey.

39:53.818 --> 39:58.432
It was a gamble that this bear took, and lost.

40:01.082 --> 40:08.536
The stab wounds he received from the walrus
are so severe that he can barely walk.

40:12.818 --> 40:15.208
The walruses are calm again

40:15.564 --> 40:22.472
seemingly aware that the injured bear
no longer poses a threat to them or their young.

40:37.970 --> 40:43.104
Unable to feed
this bear will not survive.

40:55.266 --> 40:58.389
If the global climate continues to warm

40:58.649 --> 41:01.630
and the Arctic ice melts sooner each year

41:01.891 --> 41:06.458
it's certain that more bears
will share this fate.

41:28.295 --> 41:30.898
At the southern end of our planet

41:30.992 --> 41:34.943
fiery ribbons are illuminating the winter skies.

41:35.180 --> 41:38.492
<i>The aurora australis.</i>

41:41.284 --> 41:46.916
This light brings no warmth
to the male penguins who are still huddling

41:47.153 --> 41:51.128
defying the coldest conditions on the planet.

42:04.639 --> 42:09.087
Their ordeal is drawing to a close.

42:16.019 --> 42:23.472
Thirty days after it last set
the sun rises once more on Antarctica.

42:45.406 --> 42:50.209
Their appalling trials have all been for this.

43:06.157 --> 43:11.125
Each father has just one meal left inside him.

43:11.315 --> 43:14.745
He's been saving it all winter.

43:15.550 --> 43:20.921
This single feeding will sustain the chicks
for a few more days

43:21.465 --> 43:24.635
but the males have not eaten
for nearly four months.

43:24.637 --> 43:29.982
If they do not eat soon
they and their chicks will die.

43:39.707 --> 43:43.114
But there is hope on the horizon.

43:55.039 --> 44:01.476
The females are returning,
and their bellies are full with fish.

44:07.012 --> 44:12.430
As they approach, waves of excitement
ripple through the huddle.

44:20.071 --> 44:27.761
Each female calls to her mate, and he,
recognizing her song, trumpets back.

44:30.387 --> 44:33.297
Reunited, at last.

44:36.372 --> 44:40.561
The mother feeds her chick for the first time.

44:44.039 --> 44:46.429
She's keen to start parenting

44:47.186 --> 44:53.361
but the father needs persuading to surrender
the chick he's been caring for all winter.

44:57.572 --> 45:04.268
He must now put his chick at risk.
In these temperatures it could freeze in seconds.

45:07.818 --> 45:10.752
The male will have to let go.

45:17.306 --> 45:21.565
Eventually, the transfer to the mother
is safely made.

45:36.636 --> 45:42.125
The chicks grow quickly
on a diet of fish and squid.

45:55.470 --> 46:01.409
Soon they're keen to explore,
but always with mother in tow.

46:03.348 --> 46:05.667
This chick is less fortunate.

46:05.786 --> 46:09.997
It's mother has not returned to claim it.

46:11.205 --> 46:18.563
Another orphan is searching for a new family,
but this female already has a chick of her own.

46:26.797 --> 46:32.901
Some orphans receive too much mothering
from penguins whose own chicks have not survived.

46:33.090 --> 46:40.473
The urge to parent is so strong, that they will
compete with one another to adopt any chick they find.

46:45.393 --> 46:48.232
Many of these squabbles will end in tragedy

46:48.445 --> 46:52.420
as the poor chick is trampled to death.

47:03.919 --> 47:09.811
Those chicks that do have parents
quickly learn survival skills.

47:10.852 --> 47:14.187
Even in spring,
they must huddle together for warmth

47:14.235 --> 47:17.831
just as their fathers did
in the depths of winter.

47:21.997 --> 47:25.806
A group of chicks has got lost in the blizzard.

47:32.170 --> 47:36.619
Cold and disorientated
they search for the colony.

47:42.984 --> 47:48.284
It will not be long before the storm
claims it's first victims.

48:07.141 --> 48:12.133
By early summer,
the chicks are surprisingly well developed

48:12.345 --> 48:16.368
and now look ready to take on the world.

48:17.527 --> 48:22.330
Those that survived their first year
have the best possible start in life

48:22.425 --> 48:28.032
thanks to the extraordinary hardships
endured by their parents.

48:28.198 --> 48:34.538
Parents who battled with the Antarctic winter,
and won.

48:43.507 --> 48:48.949
In the Arctic the two polar bear cubs
are now independent of their mother

48:49.020 --> 48:54.533
and they briefly reunite
where their home ranges overlap.

49:00.685 --> 49:03.596
Their time together will be fleeting.

49:03.927 --> 49:06.885
Most of their lives are now spent alone

49:07.026 --> 49:11.072
wandering the vast tracts of frozen ocean.

49:40.082 --> 49:44.790
Following their mother,
has prepared them for life at the pole

49:44.908 --> 49:50.113
an ever changing land ruled by ice.

49:51.178 --> 49:56.572
Whether they are ready for the bigger changes
that have begun to shape the ice worlds of our planet

49:56.809 --> 50:01.281
remains to be seen.
