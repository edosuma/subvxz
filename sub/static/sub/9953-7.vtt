00:01.376 --> 00:02.661
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.836 --> 00:03.746
- Colorado Kid murder.

00:03.921 --> 00:05.127
- It's a very old case.

00:06.298 --> 00:09.085
- He's alive.
And I think he's on the run.

00:09.218 --> 00:12.460
- Hunter. It's not a person.
It's... a meteor storm.

00:12.638 --> 00:16.381
- It comes every 27 years.
And when it does, I disappear.

00:16.558 --> 00:17.934
- You told him everything?
- Yeah, we're friends.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.012
Is that a problem?
- Stay away from her.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.848
They call themselves the Guard.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.938
I need to know what your people are doing,
and what I'm involved in.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.685
- My people help the Troubled,
and we do it any way we can.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.230
- I am one of you now.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.573
- I heard his first name,
I matched it with a facial composite.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.028
- James Cogan.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.827
That's his name.
- It's the bolt-gun killer.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.535
What if he's not using
body parts for trophies?

00:42.709 --> 00:44.085
What if he's building a woman?

00:49.633 --> 00:51.339
- This is crazy.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.137
Well, the sun's going down, finally.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.224
What do we do, Rica?
- Stop talking, Dan.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.560
Just stop.
- Oh, baby...

01:03.730 --> 01:05.641
- Don't touch her,
we don't know how this works.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.852
- What do you expect me to do?
- Wait.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.734
The sun's almost down,
all we have to do is wait.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.235
- Okay, enough, all right?
Enough!

01:20.372 --> 01:21.703
I'm calling the police, all right?

01:21.832 --> 01:22.912
Lizzy's death was an accident...

01:23.041 --> 01:24.030
- No...
- They'll understand!

01:24.209 --> 01:25.995
There's more than one phone
in this house, Rica.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.664
We didn't kill her, all right?

01:28.797 --> 01:30.128
We need help.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.963
Our daughter's dead.
- Don't say that.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.753
(glass shattering)

01:41.143 --> 01:43.099
Where's Lizzy?
(creaking)

01:56.325 --> 01:57.986
- Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Daddy.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.081
- Nathan, I got a plane to catch.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.708
- And I'm giving you two days off
to hunt down this lead.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.919
You can tell me the basics.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.789
- Paul and June Cogan.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.257
They were the parents
of the Colorado Kid,

02:16.386 --> 02:19.344
James Cogan.
He went missing in 1983.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.924
- What did they say
when you talked to them?

02:21.099 --> 02:24.591
- Paul's dead, and I keep getting
an answering machine at the house.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.351
That's why I need
to fly to Colorado,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.391
because maybe June can tell me
where James is.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.808
Which would be good,
because supposedly, l...

02:31.985 --> 02:33.361
I loved him.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.027
When I was Lucy,
I wrote myself that note

02:36.156 --> 02:38.943
saying that I had to find him
before I go away.

02:43.372 --> 02:46.205
- You know, I am all for...

02:46.375 --> 02:47.865
Audrey staying on vantage,

02:48.043 --> 02:49.579
but you don't want to scare the guy.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.372
So I'm just suggesting,

02:51.505 --> 02:53.211
start soft.
You know, small talk.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.456
Colorado Avalanche,
people like hockey.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.878
I don't, personally,
but some people do.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.383
Uh, flight leaves in two hours,
so we should...

03:03.266 --> 03:04.642
- He's driving you to the airport?

03:06.353 --> 03:08.218
- Uh, nope.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.017
Going... all the way to Colorado.

03:11.733 --> 03:15.146
- You said that one of us should stay behind,
and that I shouldn't go alone, so...

03:15.278 --> 03:18.486
- 23 days left, you have
to spend two of them with Duke?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.697
- I give great moral support.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.489
- Just take care of her.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.828
Check in.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.451
- She doesn't need a doctor.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.964
- Yeah. She fell out of a tree,

03:35.090 --> 03:37.832
broke her neck, and then came back alive,
totally fine.

03:37.968 --> 03:38.957
I'm getting her checked out.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.506
- Why can't you just accept it?
We should be grateful.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.378
- To who?
- I don't care who,

03:43.557 --> 03:45.639
or what. It happened, Dan.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.974
Someone called us
and saved our family.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.434
It's a miracle.
- Yeah.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.560
(tires screeching)

03:51.732 --> 03:52.767
Rica!

03:54.484 --> 03:55.860
(tires screeching)

03:56.027 --> 03:57.437
(agonized shout)

03:57.571 --> 03:58.731
Baby!

03:59.364 --> 04:00.524
- Mommy? Mommy...

04:01.241 --> 04:03.903
- Oh, baby, it's okay.
Daddy's here.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.536
Daddy's gonna fix it, okay?

04:10.625 --> 04:13.367
(theme music)

04:45.368 --> 04:47.404
(paramedics muttering)

04:51.333 --> 04:53.164
- Car's a Range Rover.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.075
Father said he didn't get
a good look at the driver.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.460
- Left a headlight,
I'll start a trace.

04:57.589 --> 04:58.954
(cellphone ringing)

04:59.132 --> 05:00.918
- Ah!

05:01.051 --> 05:02.336
Hello?

05:02.511 --> 05:03.626
Uh-huh.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.587
- Could be breaking the bad news
to the next of kin?

05:07.766 --> 05:09.757
- What do you mean,
you'll have to call me back?

05:09.935 --> 05:11.516
But... God!

05:11.645 --> 05:14.557
- That's a weird way to break
the bad news, huh?

05:17.776 --> 05:21.234
- Could be involved in his wife's
hit-and-run. Follow him.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.274
- Solo, or with Audrey?

05:23.406 --> 05:25.192
- Audrey's in Colorado
for a couple days.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.405
- Everything all right?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.823
- Will be.
As long as you pick up the slack.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.825
- Eh, be glad to.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.449
That spooky stuff had me
off my game for a little while.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.622
I'm gonna enjoy the hell out of doing
some good old-fashioned surveillance.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.456
(telephones ringing)

05:49.683 --> 05:51.719
- Jordan.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.807
How long you been waiting?

05:57.607 --> 06:00.098
- Long enough to talk myself
out of snooping.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.478
- What's wrong?
- My friend Grady disappeared.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.024
-VVhen?
- A few weeks ago.

06:06.199 --> 06:10.613
He was supposed to bring a Troubled guy in
from California, start a new life here.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.452
- I didn't know the relocation operation
went cross-country.

06:13.582 --> 06:14.822
- It does.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.870
But Grady missed a couple check-ins,
and we can't find the new guy.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.751
- So your friend went AWOL
a few weeks back?

06:23.300 --> 06:25.461
That's when the bolt-gun killer
showed up in Haven.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.505
- Yeah, I did that math.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.379
The evidence that the serial psycho's
in the Guard,

06:30.515 --> 06:31.846
I want to see it.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.019
- Pulled these
off a surveillance camera

06:42.110 --> 06:44.066
at a crime scene.
- This watch.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.070
It's a crappy gift
I gave to Grady years ago.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.736
- Watch, tattoo...
It sure looks

06:50.911 --> 06:53.118
like your man Grady could be
the bolt-gun killer.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.578
- The woman in the photo,
what did he do to her?

06:56.625 --> 06:57.705
- You don't want to know.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.876
(QUIDS)
(hyperventilating)

07:12.182 --> 07:14.468
- How could Grady do this?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.223
- We think...

07:19.356 --> 07:22.189
he's using the parts to build
some kind of Franken-woman.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.649
- Let me bring him in.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.894
- Jordan, this guy
kidnapped Audrey Parker.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.237
He's already cut up
three women that we know of.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.651
This is a police matter.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.483
- The police will only drive him
further underground.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.235
I can handle it.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.454
He's one of mine.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.243
He's one of ours.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.417
Give me 24 hours
to make this right.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.032
(cellphone ringing)
- Wuornos.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.541
- Looks like Dan Hamilton ’3
been a busy man.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.032
He dropped his kid off with Grandma,

08:22.210 --> 08:25.247
then he made a stop at the bank
and took out a large cash withdrawal.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.415
- Where's the money now?

08:26.589 --> 08:27.999
- He stashed it
in the Athletic Center,

08:28.133 --> 08:30.249
I think in a locker.
He ’3 still in there.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.668
Look like a classic money drop
if you ask me.

08:32.804 --> 08:36.422
- Maybe Dan Hamilton paid someone
to take his wife out.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.799
Call me at his next stop,
I'll meet you there.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.946
- Hey.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.026
Wha... why are you so nervous?

08:57.203 --> 09:00.536
- I've been, what,
at least three other people

09:00.665 --> 09:04.499
in my life, and one of them
was in love with the Colorado Kid,

09:04.669 --> 09:07.081
and he could be
on the other side of that door,

09:07.255 --> 09:08.870
and all I can think about is,

09:09.049 --> 09:11.040
I should've worn my other pants.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.626
- Audrey, you are officially a girl.

09:15.764 --> 09:19.427
Look... let's just pray
that he doesn't have a unibrow.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.842
(chuckles)

09:26.149 --> 09:27.434
(knocking on door)

09:33.865 --> 09:36.151
- We're looking for the owner
of this boarding house,

09:36.326 --> 09:37.406
uh, a June Cogan.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.613
- Who's "we"?

09:43.625 --> 09:45.161
You're a long way from Haven.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.917
- June Cogan has a son named James Cogan,
where are they?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.168
- Don't know.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.130
Never heard of them.
I just pay my rent.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.337
Well... good day, officer.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.436
- What the hell is that death omen
doing in Colorado?

10:06.606 --> 10:07.686
- What?

10:12.654 --> 10:14.110
- Hi, I'm sorry to bother you...

10:15.115 --> 10:16.605
Why don't we have
an honest conversation

10:16.783 --> 10:19.195
about what the hell that thing
is doing on your front porch.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.859
- Hey.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.079
My name is Audrey Parker.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.413
We know that that symbol means
that you work for the Guard.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.332
- I put that up
for folks who are special.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.417
So they know this is a safe house.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.835
They can rest here.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.254
- Where are the Cogans, really?

10:37.387 --> 10:39.628
Specifically, where is James Cogan?

10:39.764 --> 10:42.141
- I don't know anything
about James Cogan.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.759
Paul Cogan, he died. Months ago.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.602
He was old.
We moved June to a home.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.238
- I won't let you do this.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.449
- Tommy, this looks like a situation.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.739
- This guy attacked me.
- Don't you dare cut her.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.737
- Easy, Dan,
you're the one with the scalpel.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.496
- All we did was drop off the body.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.331
- She's not a body, she's my wife!

11:09.460 --> 11:12.873
- Dan, how about you let these people go.
Then we can talk.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.920
- Go.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.842
- You don't need that now.
Drop the knife.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.677
- The sun has set.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.651
- Turn around,
put your hands behind your back.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.275
What happens at sunset?

11:42.118 --> 11:44.200
- Uh, chief. Chief.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.412
- Baby? Baby?

11:55.548 --> 11:56.503
Let go of me!

11:56.633 --> 11:57.713
Let...

11:58.593 --> 12:00.458
Baby... we gotcha.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.170
(gasping)

12:03.306 --> 12:05.217
Oh, God! Oh...

12:14.234 --> 12:16.270
- I know you love your wife.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.400
Which is why I don't believe

12:18.571 --> 12:20.311
you paid to have
a hit put out on her.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.063
But here's the problem I have.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.737
I watched you drop off cash.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.609
Now...

12:26.746 --> 12:29.909
and I can't even believe
I'm about to say this...

12:32.168 --> 12:35.205
Did you pay to have her
brought back to life?

12:36.923 --> 12:40.836
- A Troubled person blackmailed him
to bring his wife back.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.300
Who does that sort of thing?

12:42.470 --> 12:45.587
- I'm gonna have to put them
all on a family therapy plan.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.851
- Appreciate you coming in.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.390
- l was surprised when you called.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.229
I thought you'd be in Colorado with Audrey.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.599
- Ah... She took Duke.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.730
- That's a polarizing choice.

13:03.658 --> 13:06.741
How does it--
- Not now, Claire.

13:07.662 --> 13:11.246
- Dan, listen.
I know you are scared.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.535
Want to protect your family.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.875
But you made a mistake.
- What do you mean?

13:16.004 --> 13:17.835
- You paid the ransom.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.706
Now the blackmailer knows
you have cash,

13:20.842 --> 13:23.379
and they will milk you
over and over again.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.967
This will not end here.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.923
You have a daughter, right?
- No, they won't do that.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.469
They already brought back Lizzy.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.638
- Your daughter died,
and she came back to life too?

13:34.564 --> 13:37.522
What does something like that even cost you?
- Nothing.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.184
Lizzy broke her neck
while she was playing in a tree.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.437
Then someone called me,
and they said

13:43.573 --> 13:46.940
to tell the paramedics
to go away and to wait.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.112
That they would bring Lizzy back at sunset.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.494
- Who called?
- Look, l-l don't know who it was.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.580
Either time.
But for Rica, they...

13:54.751 --> 13:58.084
they told me to... just to put the money
in a locker at the Athletic Center.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.464
- So they got you on the hook
with a freebie,

14:00.590 --> 14:03.206
and every life after
is gonna cost you big money.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.170
- I got a hit on the headlight
from the hit-and-run.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.093
- Thanks.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.055
That's the great thing
about luxury cars.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.179
Every part's registered.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.482
(cellphone buzzing)

14:27.742 --> 14:31.530
- What is your relationship
to Sophia and Charlie Carter?

14:31.746 --> 14:34.579
- We're partners in an organic
vegetable farm. Why?

14:34.749 --> 14:36.114
- Because the car
that mowed Rica down

14:36.250 --> 14:38.912
is registered to the two of them.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.382
- Surprised you called.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.754
- Dwight, I called you
because Grady's gone

14:50.890 --> 14:53.632
and we couldn't find the Troubled person
that he was bringing in.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.175
- lf Grady screwed up a job,

14:55.311 --> 14:57.893
then something is very, very wrong.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.722
- There's a chance that Grady
has something to do

15:00.858 --> 15:02.940
with that bolt-gun serial killer.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.651
- And to protect the Guard,
you need to bring Grady in discreetly.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.232
- And quickly.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.527
That dude with the clipboard,

15:10.660 --> 15:12.946
he's the guy that Grady
was supposed to meet?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.444
- Yeah.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.172
Hey, Ray. Got a minute?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.757
- Sorry, buddy. Name's Mike.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.344
- No, he had it right the first time.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.882
- 'Bout time I heard from you people.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.394
Been twisting out here for weeks.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.351
- You mean you didn't get
your welcome package?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.517
- I got no cash, no lD, nothing.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.686
You said I could
make a new life in Haven.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.684
That I'd be safe here with my condition.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.686
- We've been looking for you.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.155
Call this number,
you'll get some help.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.899
Now, what happened to Grady,
your contact?

15:53.077 --> 15:54.032
- I don't know.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.491
I went to the old Kitchener Mill
on Route 17, like he told me.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.246
But I ran when the cops showed up.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.457
- The cops?
- Almost got me.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.291
- Mrs. Cogan.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.256
Hi, I'm a friend of your son, James.

16:13.389 --> 16:16.222
- James is such a good boy.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.342
He drew a picture for me
in school today.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.395
(quietly)
- Maybe James is, uh,

16:23.524 --> 16:25.185
an art teacher
at an elementary school.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.229
- Don't be silly.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.023
James is only nine years old.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.405
Little boys can't be teachers.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.400
(quietly): Yep.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.118
- Mrs. Cogan?

16:45.546 --> 16:47.457
l have a lot of important questions for you.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.463
Ca... can you look at me?

16:54.931 --> 16:55.966
- You.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.929
Sarah, why did you change your hair?

17:01.062 --> 17:03.053
You were so pretty as a redhead.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.398
You said you'd never come back.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.355
- Excuse me, who are you?

17:10.488 --> 17:12.103
This is a private facility.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.571
- Uh, ah... yeah, you know what?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.439
I'm sorry--
- No unauthorized visitors.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.358
This woman has Alzheimer's.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.201
You're scaring her.
- Yes...

17:19.330 --> 17:21.446
I understand that. But, um--
- It's okay, it's okay, listen,

17:21.624 --> 17:23.990
l-l just need to ask you
a few more questions, all right?

17:24.126 --> 17:26.833
Do you know where James is?
How... how do you know me?

17:26.963 --> 17:29.124
- I don't know you.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.168
Why are you in my room?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.131
- That's it. I'm getting security.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.637
(quietly): Audrey, I think this lady's gone.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.722
- Oh, she... she can't be.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.011
- Maybe we'll come back.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.271
We'll find another way.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.431
(Nathan): Home of Charlie
and Sophia Carter.

17:48.568 --> 17:49.899
Not a bad spread.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.152
- Farm workers.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.112
That's a lot of mouths to feed.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.701
- No Range Rover, though.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.826
- Would you park your luxury model
murder weapon

18:00.955 --> 18:02.695
in the driveway?
(Tommy chuckles)

18:02.832 --> 18:04.914
(knocking at door)

18:07.253 --> 18:09.244
- Police!

18:11.674 --> 18:12.914
Sophia Carter?

18:14.510 --> 18:16.125
What happened?

18:23.227 --> 18:25.388
- Why didn't it work?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.637
I paid the damn money!

18:28.941 --> 18:29.896
(sobbing)

18:30.234 --> 18:33.021
Someone was supposed to come
and lay hands on him.

18:33.154 --> 18:36.237
lt's past sundown.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.230
(sobbing)

18:38.367 --> 18:41.200
Charlie's not supposed to stay dead.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.240
They promised.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.288
- Who promised?

18:47.627 --> 18:50.494
- Whoever killed my husband.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.388
- Hey.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.313
Mrs. Carter was blackmailed too.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.563
So we have a Troubled person
killing people,

19:14.695 --> 19:17.072
and demanding ransom money
to bring them back.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.572
- Sophia Carter said she paid up.
So what went wrong?

19:20.701 --> 19:22.362
- I don't know.

19:22.995 --> 19:26.112
Blackmailers hit familiar targets,
wealthy people.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.824
- So, what we're looking for
is someone

19:29.960 --> 19:32.827
who knew both of the families,
who they trusted.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.250
- Someone like an employee.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.749
(cellphone ringing)

19:37.885 --> 19:39.921
Put together a list,
start checking alibis.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.464
- Yeah.

19:44.725 --> 19:45.840
- How's it going out there?

19:45.976 --> 19:48.058
- Uh, I'm gonna need
a few more days.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.553
I haven't found anything
on James Cogan or Lucy yet,

19:50.690 --> 19:53.147
but I did find something interesting.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.433
- Gonna tell me what it is?

19:55.611 --> 19:58.478
- The tattooed people, they're running
a safe house out of Colorado.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.105
I think it’s a transfer point
or something.

20:01.283 --> 20:05.526
Anyway, maybe I helped relocate people
when l was Sarah, in a past life?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.696
l-l don't know,
I know it sounds crazy, but...

20:07.832 --> 20:08.821
- No, it doesn’t sound crazy.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.490
The Guard operates a network nationwide.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.209
- You... you didn't tell me that part.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.421
- I didn't tell you
because I just found out myself.

20:17.591 --> 20:21.254
- Okay, is there anything else
that you, uh,

20:21.429 --> 20:23.294
want to tell me?

20:23.973 --> 20:26.680
- There's a Troubled person
murdering rich people

20:26.809 --> 20:29.642
and resurrecting them at sundown
for ransom money.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.302
- Wait, you're serious?

20:31.439 --> 20:33.976
- Tommy and I got it under control.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.941
I hope you and Duke
find some answers.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.611
- Thanks.

20:40.906 --> 20:41.895
(knock at door)

20:42.908 --> 20:44.444
- Hey.

20:45.453 --> 20:46.613
How's Officer Grumpy?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.202
- Grumpy.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.738
Any luck finding another room?

20:50.875 --> 20:52.115
-Ah... no.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.833
This is the last room in the house.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.546
Apparently, there...
there's a lumberjack tournament in town.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.171
I'm not making that up.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.050
That is a real...
It's really a thing here.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.294
I swear.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.796
And worse, there's no bar, so...

21:07.266 --> 21:10.679
- All right, well, uh,
at least you have a couch to sleep on.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.265
- Lucky me.
- Yeah.

21:13.397 --> 21:17.436
All right, so I was Lucy in the '80s,
I was Sarah in the '50s.

21:17.568 --> 21:20.059
When I was Lucy,
l was in love with the Colorado Kid.

21:20.196 --> 21:24.189
And Sarah, maybe I helped
to relocate Troubled people.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.533
But why did June think
l was Sarah, and not Lucy?

21:27.661 --> 21:30.198
- You know, maybe... maybe...

21:30.331 --> 21:33.368
Sarah and old lady Cogan
knew each other from way back.

21:33.501 --> 21:36.288
- Yeah, but there's...
there's only one person

21:36.420 --> 21:38.536
that can help us with that,
and that's June Cogan.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.879
And her memory is about
as cooperative as mine.

21:41.050 --> 21:45.009
- Her memories, maybe.
But not her mementos.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.551
Uh...

21:49.683 --> 21:52.095
I lifted this off of
June Cogan's night table.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.640
- You took a photo album
from an old woman?

21:54.772 --> 21:57.354
- Well, it sounds much worse
when you say it like that.

21:57.525 --> 21:58.890
You can scold me later.

22:00.569 --> 22:04.153
- No way, this is the sweetest form
of thievery ever.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.571
- I'm a sweet thief.

22:11.121 --> 22:14.158
Baby photos, school pictures.

22:20.005 --> 22:23.793
- James Cogan's life
was really well documented.

22:23.926 --> 22:27.510
- Do you feel anything
when you look at these?

22:27.638 --> 22:30.345
I mean, does he seem familiar?

22:30.933 --> 22:31.968
- I know that l...

22:32.101 --> 22:34.888
I loved him, but I just...
I don't...

22:36.397 --> 22:38.433
I don't... I don't know.

22:38.566 --> 22:41.308
- Don't really see any Lucy
or Sarah in there.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.649
Wait, what's...

22:45.948 --> 22:48.109
The Colorado Kid got married.

22:50.452 --> 22:51.487
Is there a date?

22:56.458 --> 22:58.289
1983.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.122
His wife's name was Arla.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.083
- So if the Colorado Kid
married Arla,

23:03.215 --> 23:06.082
then where does Lucy fit in,
or Sarah for that matter?

23:06.260 --> 23:09.343
- Why don't we just focus on
one past life at a time.

23:10.681 --> 23:11.841
But look, I mean,

23:12.016 --> 23:14.223
marriages have records, you know?

23:14.351 --> 23:17.309
Let's go see what we can find out
about Arla Cogan.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.479
- And you can prove
you were there all day?

23:25.654 --> 23:27.394
All right. Thanks.

23:30.993 --> 23:31.982
- Here.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.871
Didn't know what else to do with myself.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.741
It's not very good, I'm afraid.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.288
The housekeeper called in sick.

23:42.463 --> 23:43.703
- The housekeeper?

23:44.298 --> 23:46.584
There was no housekeeper
on your employee records.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.547
- Oh, Moira insists
that we pay her under the table.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.842
I don't like it,
but she rarely misses a day.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.305
- Is she full-time?

23:55.434 --> 23:57.174
- We have her two days a week.

23:57.311 --> 24:00.018
She works for other families.
- She work for the Hamiltons?

24:00.731 --> 24:03.564
- Yes. Why are you so interested?

24:05.402 --> 24:09.065
- Moira's my sister.
What do you want me to do, Joseph?

24:09.198 --> 24:11.109
I... You know it's complicated.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.948
- All I know is she dragged you
into a blackmail scheme.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.488
She murdered Charlie Carter.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.703
- We should've gotten to him before sundown!

24:17.831 --> 24:19.367
- Noelle?

24:21.877 --> 24:23.162
We have to leave town.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.331
- You can'tjust barge in here, Moira.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.795
- The cops are at the Carter's.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.960
They're gonna figure it out.
- Leave her alone.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.510
When are you gonna stop punishing her?

24:30.636 --> 24:33.002
- Oh, I see what this is.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.005
Noelle, think your boyfriend knows best?

24:36.892 --> 24:38.678
- No, Moira, please.

24:38.811 --> 24:42.269
Moira, what if...
what if you go by yourself?

24:42.398 --> 24:43.888
We won't tell the police anything.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.230
You can take the money.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.730
(screams)

24:48.904 --> 24:51.111
- I can't have your little boyfriend
screwing this up, okay?

24:57.413 --> 24:58.368
Now get your passport,

24:58.539 --> 24:59.949
and whatever else you need,
and put it in here.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.663
We have to leave, and fast.
Okay?

25:01.792 --> 25:05.125
- Okay! Whatever you say,
just let me touch him.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.378
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.720
(screaming)

25:20.853 --> 25:25.392
- Shh, shh, shh, shh...
(moaning)

25:25.524 --> 25:27.355
Just take it.

25:27.484 --> 25:32.103
Big sister's gonna fix everything. Shh.

25:40.622 --> 25:44.114
- Lucky guy.
Only thing left of that GSW is the scar.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.703
- Neighbours heard a gunshot,
backs up the boyfriend's story.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.170
He insists Noelle's innocent.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.756
- Both sisters took off
just before we got here.

25:54.428 --> 25:58.216
- Noelle's a paramedic.
Easy for her to lay hands on a dead body.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.634
First responders
when the little girl broke her neck,

26:00.768 --> 26:02.599
and they dropped Rica Hamilton
off at the morgue.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.309
- So Moira's the one with the brains,

26:04.438 --> 26:06.224
Noelle's the one with the Trouble.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.014
- We gotta stop 'em.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.858
They let Charlie Carter die,
he won't be the last one.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.645
They couldn't have gotten far
with that roadblock.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.028
Thanks.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.526
Laverne, what do you got?

26:20.662 --> 26:22.163
- The sisters were orphans,

26:22.289 --> 26:23.870
bounced around foster homes
for years.

26:23.999 --> 26:27.366
But before their dad died they lived
in a cabin out by Trapingus Cove.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.580
- All right.
- What's the address?

26:29.755 --> 26:31.370
- Ah, they don't use
street addresses out there.

26:31.548 --> 26:35.040
Cabins are mostly off the grid.
We're gonna have to search every one.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.431
- Cops. Roadblocks.

26:45.813 --> 26:48.099
We can't get out of Haven tonight.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.521
This plan should've worked.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.564
These clients

26:58.700 --> 27:00.952
waste more money in a day...

27:02.621 --> 27:04.657
than I can make in a month.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.165
- You were gonna kill
all these people?

27:13.882 --> 27:15.418
- Temporarily.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.425
That scar is a pity.

27:18.554 --> 27:20.510
We wasted a good death
on your boyfriend.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.095
- You made your point.

27:22.266 --> 27:24.848
- We would be further ahead
if you could absorb

27:24.977 --> 27:26.387
more than one death a day.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.928
- Dad said that more than
one death a day is dangerous.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.521
It could kill me. How many times--
- I am...

27:31.650 --> 27:34.733
so sick...

27:35.612 --> 27:37.728
of hearing that excuse.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.189
I told you that you becoming a paramedic

27:40.325 --> 27:42.987
was a stupid idea with your...

27:43.287 --> 27:44.652
disease.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.322
And then you had to go
and touch the Hamilton kid.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.585
With your bare hands!
- We know Lizzy!

27:50.711 --> 27:53.043
We saw her grow up.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.958
And the parents were so broken,

27:55.090 --> 27:57.331
l-l-l couldn't let her die.

27:57.509 --> 28:01.047
(laughing)
- You're still such a child.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.346
Couldn't let the neighbours' cat die.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.007
Couldn't let the neighbours' kid die,
but...

28:08.729 --> 28:11.641
you wouldn't save Dad.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.224
Where'd you think
this was gonna end?

28:16.361 --> 28:17.771
- Not with blackmail.

28:17.905 --> 28:19.395
Or murder.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.567
You took advantage, it's... it's sick.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.861
- And yet you're still here.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.451
Maybe...

28:26.955 --> 28:28.741
you feel guilty.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.589
Next town...

28:40.344 --> 28:41.834
HO screw-ups.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.258
- Moira, we have to stop.
- We're not stopping...

28:46.391 --> 28:48.598
till I get what's coming to me.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.189
- So, Arla Cogan, she killed herself

28:56.318 --> 28:58.274
when the Colorado Kid went missing.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.144
So he and Lucy, they...

29:00.322 --> 29:02.938
they never really had
this big love affair.

29:05.619 --> 29:07.735
(sighing)
This... this whole thing,

29:07.871 --> 29:09.987
this is just... this is ridiculous.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.374
- Look.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.491
(sighing)
- When I first showed up to Haven,

29:13.627 --> 29:16.869
l was an FBI agent,
I was looking into a case.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.541
I knew who I was.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.414
Life was good. It was good.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.004
And then I found out I had,
what, not one, but two...

29:23.178 --> 29:25.715
two past lives, that I know of.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.591
Nothing is what I thought it was.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.685
The first past life
I was completely wrong about,

29:33.814 --> 29:35.099
and the other one...

29:35.232 --> 29:37.393
the other one's still
a mystery to me.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.266
- You know, if you want
something stronger that,

29:39.403 --> 29:41.359
I saw Funyuns in the vending machine.

29:41.530 --> 29:44.192
- Funyuns, yes. Funyuns...

29:44.324 --> 29:46.906
- Yeah...
- And... and pizza,

29:47.035 --> 29:48.821
and... and hand-rolled cigars,

29:48.954 --> 29:51.991
and, uh... and skydiving,
and those little... candy that's...

29:52.124 --> 29:53.660
the dispenser thing.
- Pez.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.328
- I've never experienced that before.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.418
- | get it, okay?
I've been saying that for a month.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.083
- A month?
- You want cigars?

30:00.215 --> 30:01.421
I got Cubans on the Cape Rouge.

30:01.550 --> 30:02.665
- A month.
(chuckles)

30:02.801 --> 30:05.133
This is... this is hilarious, right?

30:05.262 --> 30:07.844
Right, you tell me about
this Hunter meteor storm thing,

30:08.015 --> 30:09.801
you explain to me what it is, that l...

30:09.933 --> 30:14.427
that | go away, and l waste
a whole month chasing what?

30:14.563 --> 30:16.394
- You didn't waste anything.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.521
You know, you...

30:20.110 --> 30:22.817
you solved the Colorado Kid mystery.

30:22.946 --> 30:26.564
And you can beat...
We can beat this Hunter thing.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.656
(laughs)

30:29.578 --> 30:30.533
- Come on, Duke.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.865
Now l have to beat a Hunter thing?

30:32.998 --> 30:36.490
No, no, l-l got what, uh, 20 days left?

30:36.626 --> 30:38.241
No, ljust...

30:40.505 --> 30:41.881
I want to live my life.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.463
- Okay.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.840
However you want to do it, you know?

30:45.969 --> 30:47.004
You want to...

30:48.513 --> 30:50.128
help the Troubled,

30:50.891 --> 30:53.007
or you just want to live your life,

30:53.602 --> 30:55.138
I'm in.

30:55.687 --> 30:56.847
-You...

30:56.980 --> 30:59.437
you are an amazing friend.

31:01.651 --> 31:04.779
- I'm just saying, you have choices.

31:05.489 --> 31:08.276
- No, no, no, no, no,
it's more than that.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.361
You're here.

31:11.036 --> 31:15.700
You... you just left everything,
and you got on a plane,

31:15.832 --> 31:17.993
and you came here
to Colorado with me.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.708
- Audrey, I'd do anything you need me to.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.666
l'd hunt down your past,

31:29.971 --> 31:31.632
l'd fight your future.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.598
- The past is gone.

31:37.062 --> 31:39.144
And the future,

31:40.399 --> 31:42.560
thank God, it is not here yet.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.976
All we have is...

32:14.391 --> 32:16.256
Uh...
(chuckles)

32:17.811 --> 32:20.803
20 days, that's...
that's not long enough for me

32:20.939 --> 32:24.181
to fix our friendship
if I screw this up. So...

32:31.950 --> 32:33.986
I'm gonna get some air.
(chuckles)

32:55.599 --> 32:58.306
- | just confirmed our flights
back to Haven.

32:59.895 --> 33:02.932
- It's beautiful here.

33:03.064 --> 33:05.100
Maybe that's why Lucy and Sarah came.

33:05.275 --> 33:06.936
'Cause of the scenery.

33:08.278 --> 33:09.688
- I knew you had
a sense of humour in there.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.569
(chuckles)

33:16.912 --> 33:18.777
- What? What are you looking at?

33:18.955 --> 33:21.241
- I'm just imagining you
as a redhead.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.656
It's hot.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.500
- Flatterer.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.378
Duke, you're a genius.

33:33.803 --> 33:35.509
- I know.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.134
Why?

33:40.560 --> 33:42.266
(cellphone ringing)

33:42.395 --> 33:44.681
- One cabin down,
plenty mo' to go.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.184
- Hang on, one second.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.150
Dwight, what’s up?
- I'm with Jordan.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.229
We found Grady.
Out at Kitchener Mill on Route 17.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.697
- You bringing him in?

33:58.703 --> 34:00.364
- He's dead. Car's burned out.

34:00.497 --> 34:01.987
He's been here for a while.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.911
He may not be your bolt-gun killer.

34:08.213 --> 34:11.330
- Nathan, one of your guys
was the last to see Grady alive.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.707
- What do you mean?
- The guy from California

34:13.885 --> 34:15.841
showed up here for a meeting,
but Haven PD broke it up.

34:15.971 --> 34:17.507
- Your source is sure about that?

34:17.681 --> 34:20.263
- He's certain,
ran when he saw the cruiser.

34:20.392 --> 34:23.179
- There hasn't been any police activity
logged out on Route 17.

34:23.353 --> 34:26.186
- Then maybe someone's gone rogue
in your department.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.108
- We need supplies,

34:32.237 --> 34:34.819
so we can wait out the roadblocks.

34:34.948 --> 34:37.655
People in the summer cabins
leave stuff behind.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.400
So I'm gonna go see what I can find.

34:40.537 --> 34:44.075
When you think
about abandoning me again,

34:44.207 --> 34:45.287
just remember,

34:45.417 --> 34:47.658
I'm the only family you've got.

34:48.336 --> 34:49.371
- I don't want this.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.335
- It's for protection.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.297
If you have to use it,

34:54.426 --> 34:56.417
you can always
bring the poor sucker back.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.309
- June, it's me.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.808
- Sarah!

35:13.945 --> 35:16.322
You said you'd never come back.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.235
Oh, give me another chance, please!

35:19.409 --> 35:21.616
- Don't be scared, okay?
I'm not angry.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.277
- The day you brought him
was like a miracle.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.655
We're a family now.

35:27.751 --> 35:29.662
- I helped you, didn't I?

35:29.794 --> 35:33.002
- We named him James.
Do you like that name?

35:33.423 --> 35:35.709
- James. Did I...
did I bring you your son

35:35.842 --> 35:38.379
from... from Haven?
- Oh, please don't take him away.

35:38.511 --> 35:40.342
We've kept him safe.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.464
- June, was... was James Troubled?

35:43.600 --> 35:45.215
Is that why you kept him safe?

35:45.393 --> 35:48.430
- I already love him so much.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.812
I know it must have hurt
to give him up, Sarah,

35:50.940 --> 35:52.805
but I can take care of him.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.684
I can protect your baby.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.941
- James Cogan is...

36:00.659 --> 36:02.615
He's my son?

36:13.338 --> 36:15.704
(grunts)
- Home sweet Haven.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.751
Potholes and all.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.296
Hey, I'm...

36:23.807 --> 36:26.298
I'm sorry we didn't get anything else
out of the old lady.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.342
- She told me the important part.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.307
I don't even think
she'd be able to remember

36:31.439 --> 36:33.600
where the Colorado Kid is, anyway.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.849
- Yeah. We didn't really
talk about it

36:35.985 --> 36:37.816
on the plane back here, but...

36:37.946 --> 36:40.483
I mean, how do you feel
knowing that you have a...

36:41.324 --> 36:42.439
a son?

36:42.575 --> 36:44.111
- I don't even know

36:44.244 --> 36:46.735
how to begin to process
that information.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.495
- Hey...

36:50.083 --> 36:51.448
It'll be our secret.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.251
- Got a few of those, I guess.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.247
(cellphone ringing)

37:02.595 --> 37:04.051
- Saved by the cell.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.723
- Hey, Nathan, we just got in.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.339
- I know.

37:07.475 --> 37:09.011
I need you out at Trapingus Cove.

37:09.144 --> 37:12.261
Tommy and I think the Troubled girl’s
hiding out in a cabin here.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.225
- The one who brings people
back from the dead?

37:14.357 --> 37:17.190
- Her name's Noelle,
she's on the run with her sister Moira.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.569
- Yeah, um, l'll...

37:18.695 --> 37:22.187
I'll get there as fast
as Duke can drive me.

37:22.323 --> 37:25.190
- Fine. I'll get you the coordinates.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.332
So it's, uh,

37:34.461 --> 37:36.543
North 4-4-9-1 -3— 7,

37:36.671 --> 37:39.458
West 6-7-0-0-3—9.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.174
- Yep, got it. Okay.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.879
We good?
- Yeah.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.928
- Route 17.

37:59.694 --> 38:00.649
- Yo.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.152
One more cabin.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.317
You wanna drive?
- No, it's your car.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.833
(cellphone ringing)

38:31.768 --> 38:33.975
- Looks like we got something.

38:34.562 --> 38:35.813
- Take the back.

38:42.695 --> 38:43.901
(pounding at door)

38:44.030 --> 38:45.895
Police!

38:47.992 --> 38:49.903
- Don't come any closer, ple... please.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.401
- Put the gun down.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.154
lt's Noelle, right?

38:55.959 --> 38:57.369
Where's your sister?

38:58.670 --> 39:01.833
We know Moira's making you do this.
Help us find her.

39:01.965 --> 39:03.580
- She's gone.

39:03.716 --> 39:04.922
Moira's had it rough.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.500
Our dad died,
she never got over it.

39:09.264 --> 39:12.631
- She stabbed Charlie Carter,
an innocent man.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.224
- l was supposed
to bring him back.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.307
But she told me to wait
until Mrs. Carter paid the money.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.350
- Sophia Carter
did pay the money.

39:20.483 --> 39:23.350
- But then my ambulance got called.
Cardiac arrest.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.860
I couldn't get to Mr. Carter by sundown.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.609
- It doesn't sound like this is your fault.

39:28.741 --> 39:30.322
Just put the gun down,
then we'll talk.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.442
- It is. Everything is my fault.

39:32.579 --> 39:34.786
I shouldn't have
brought Lizzy back.

39:34.914 --> 39:37.030
I should've turned Moira in
when she killed Rica Hamilton,

39:37.166 --> 39:38.372
ljust...

39:40.503 --> 39:42.494
She's my sister.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.246
- Easy.

39:44.424 --> 39:45.789
Easy now.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.467
Nobody has to get hurt.

39:49.637 --> 39:50.888
Give me that.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.802
- I'm sorry.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.594
I'm so sorry.

40:01.608 --> 40:04.771
l'm freezing.
- Stay with her.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.809
I'll get her a blanket out of the trunk,
call it in.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.278
- Hey, chief,
if it's all the same to you,

40:09.407 --> 40:11.113
why don't we just, uh, you know, trade.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.400
You better with people.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.281
Trunk's a mess, anyway.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.996
- Moira could be long gone.

40:24.005 --> 40:27.088
Take a look inside,
see if she left anything interesting.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.840
- Left behind a whole sister.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.381
Can't tell if that's stupid orjust cold.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.016
(unlocking trunk)

40:58.873 --> 41:00.238
- A bolt gun.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.123
- It's a nice one too.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.122
Modified it myself.

41:14.931 --> 41:16.387
- You're the bolt-gun killer.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.717
(gunshot)

41:41.958 --> 41:45.621
(gunshots)
- Ah!

41:51.092 --> 41:53.799
- Hey, what happened?
Where's Nathan?

42:04.022 --> 42:05.808
Oh... No...

42:06.691 --> 42:09.057
Nathan...

42:09.277 --> 42:11.188
- It was the...Noelle,
the... the... the Troubled girl.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.569
She was... she started shooting,
and he got in the middle.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.990
By the time I got...
I got outside, itjust...

42:58.576 --> 43:01.409
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
