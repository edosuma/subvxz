[soldier 1 in Spanish] Now!

00:21.021 --> 00:22.981
[Limon] Fuck! They found us, boss.

00:23.064 --> 00:23.982
Motherfuckers!

00:26.151 --> 00:27.527
Upstairs, come on!

-[soldier groans]
-Boss, this way!

00:36.995 --> 00:38.371
[soldier 2] We have him.
Don't let him get away!

[soldier groans]

00:41.875 --> 00:43.001
Move it!

00:44.252 --> 00:45.628
Let's go!

00:45.712 --> 00:47.338
-[Pablo] Go, go!
-[groans]

00:51.968 --> 00:52.969

00:57.682 --> 00:59.017
[soldier 3] It's him!

01:03.897 --> 01:04.773
[grunting]

01:11.654 --> 01:13.156
[soldier 4] Cease fire!

01:13.239 --> 01:14.449
Cease fire!

01:14.532 --> 01:15.617
Cease fire!

01:18.745 --> 01:19.746
[breathing heavily]

01:23.041 --> 01:24.459
[soldier 5] Sergeant Sarmiento…

01:25.877 --> 01:27.587
You just shot Pablo Escobar!

01:32.050 --> 01:33.343
[gun fires]

-[soldier 6] Long live Colombia!

[male reporter] <i>Pablo Escobar,</i>

02:05.166 --> 02:06.251
[chuckles]

02:07.794 --> 02:09.212
Yeah, I'm watching…

02:10.672 --> 02:12.340
Congratulations.

02:13.424 --> 02:14.551
Eh?

02:14.634 --> 02:15.593
The house?

02:16.928 --> 02:18.096
Still working on it.

02:19.013 --> 02:19.931
Look…

02:21.349 --> 02:23.434
Can you get out of town?

02:23.977 --> 02:26.020
[woman on TV speaking indistinctly]

02:26.104 --> 02:27.522
Wherever you want, brother.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.401
Don't think it's smart
to meet in Cali right now.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.614
But it's time we had that conversation.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.618
All right.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.789
[woman on TV] <i>I want you to remember</i>
<i>all the good things he did.</i>

02:44.873 --> 02:46.833

[narrator] <i>In December of 1993, the death</i>

04:35.858 --> 04:38.444

04:47.078 --> 04:48.538
[man on street] Holy shit!
He just ran the light.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.623
[man 2] Can someone see if they're okay?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.458
[woman on street] Oh, my God.
Call an ambulance!

04:52.542 --> 04:56.170

[investigator] <i>You're telling me</i>

we can use, Jairo.

'Cause you're a minor

05:33.166 --> 05:35.626

don't apply to you.

05:35.710 --> 05:39.088
You can dump his ass
in a lion pit, he still don't know shit.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.507
Just like the rest of 'em.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.510
[captain] I guess you're lucky
'cause it's not your problem much longer.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.095
Get anything off the kid?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.973
Yeah. Amado's usin' robots.

05:49.057 --> 05:49.891
[chuckles]

05:49.974 --> 05:51.434
That wouldn't surprise me.

05:52.268 --> 05:55.563
-Well, um, here.
-[door closes]

05:55.646 --> 05:56.981
I wanted to be the one to…

05:58.066 --> 06:01.903
Your official Chicago transfer,
parking and all.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.321
Talked with your new ASAC.

06:03.404 --> 06:07.075
I might have laid it on a bit thick,
but I'm sure you'll live up.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.868
Anyway…

06:08.951 --> 06:12.580
All right, man, thank you.

06:14.248 --> 06:15.249
[speaking indistinctly]

06:17.585 --> 06:20.046
[Spanish song playing over radio]

06:40.191 --> 06:44.278
[Mayo in Spanish] Here to fuck up
my business, too?

06:46.280 --> 06:48.533
No. I won't move your product on my boats.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.828
After that shit
you pulled in Puerto Vallarta,

06:51.911 --> 06:53.204
shouldn't even be talking to you.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.503
Come on, Mayo.
Looks like you could use a hand.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.759
[Azul] Look, mistakes got made.

07:08.928 --> 07:12.890
We know what we did might leave you
in a bad spot with the Arellanos.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.101
But figured telling you would…

07:15.184 --> 07:16.602
Force me to choose sides.

07:18.104 --> 07:22.942
Truth is, now we have no routes.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.778
We can offer you protection.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.366
You aren't in a position
to offer anyone protection.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.410
We're not afraid of those assholes.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.206
[exhales]

07:48.551 --> 07:50.261
You're fucked, Chapo…

07:53.222 --> 07:55.808
Taking out Benjamín was…

07:57.643 --> 07:59.312
probably the right move for you.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.941
It's not your strategy I question.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.360
It's your aim.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.615
And since you failed,
you also lost access to the border.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.993
So you can't pay for the war
you just started with the Arellanos.

08:14.535 --> 08:15.369
Hmm?

08:17.121 --> 08:19.624
You didn't just attack them,

08:20.833 --> 08:22.376
you embarrassed them.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.505
They're gonna make an example of you.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.177
I could hand you assholes
my whole operation,

08:31.844 --> 08:34.388
wouldn't make a dent in your problems.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.182
What about Güero?

08:37.099 --> 08:39.268
I hope he's off
making a deal with the Gulf.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.646
Waiting on word now.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.941
Amado's your best bet,
but you're here talking to me.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.902
-Amado just hasn't called us back yet…
-[cell phone ringing]

08:49.570 --> 08:50.738
[Mayo] What's up, Güero?

08:50.821 --> 08:52.073
Chapo.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.244
Amado's not picking up
'cause he knows what you'll ask.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.287
Hmm.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.834
[grunting]

09:05.044 --> 09:06.712
You have my friendship

09:08.089 --> 09:09.674
but not my boats.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.969
We're all responsible
for our own survival.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.096
Things the way they are,

09:15.972 --> 09:17.181
you can't win this fight.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.935
Thanks for your time, Mayo.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.562
[Chapo] Hey, Mayo…

09:23.271 --> 09:24.355
Excuse me, Azul.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.485
What would you do?

09:30.444 --> 09:31.279
Huh?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.532
What would you do if you were us?

09:37.618 --> 09:39.245
Stay out of sight, Chapo.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.372
Hide for a bit.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.377
Pay your men well,
you'll need their loyalty.

09:48.671 --> 09:49.964
Keep after Amado.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.925
He doesn't like to disappoint his friends.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.554
And brother,

09:57.430 --> 09:59.432
pray an earthquake hits Tijuana.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.440
[Chapo] Okay, Mayo. Thank you.

10:07.523 --> 10:08.524
[car starting]

10:13.279 --> 10:14.405
[car door opens]

10:17.825 --> 10:18.659
[sighs]

10:19.368 --> 10:21.704
Güero says Abrego laughed in his face.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.040
The Gulf's closed to us, too.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.792
[Chapo] Fuck.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.961
So what do we do now?

10:30.504 --> 10:34.508
Mayo's right, we need to keep
our fucking heads low.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.928
I'm heading to Culiacan.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.974
You get to Guadalajara,
wait it out in a safe house.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.518
Wait for what?

10:46.687 --> 10:48.022
The fucking earthquake.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.249
Everything good?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.250
All good.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.336
At your service.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.966
Where you think you're going?

11:16.842 --> 11:19.428
[Marta] Was supposed to be done
40 minutes ago.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.806
[waiter] Hey, I don't want to hear it.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.351
[Pacho] All the way to fucking Cuba,

11:26.852 --> 11:28.896
just to see another Mexican.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.523
What's up, bro?

11:32.358 --> 11:33.692
You look good.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.364
Sorry we're late,
bureaucrats wanted some attention.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.323
No.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.660
For communists they've got a lot of
fucking business proposals, eh?

11:42.743 --> 11:44.537
I'm afraid you're about to hear another.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.206
Chepe, Gilberto, you remember Amado.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.874
-How are you?
-How are you?

11:49.667 --> 11:52.962
[Amado] Thanks for making
the trip up here.

11:54.630 --> 11:59.176
I believe that in this business,
partnerships work best

11:59.260 --> 12:02.179
when we take the time
to understand each other.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.015
From what I know of you,

12:05.933 --> 12:07.977
and from the time I've spent with Pacho,

12:09.186 --> 12:11.564
I've come to think you see
things as I see them.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.608
Ah, this is the business part?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.735
Yeah, this is the business part.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.363
And what I see is this:

12:20.531 --> 12:22.241
With Medellin going down,

12:22.324 --> 12:23.826
the business is changing.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.704
Which means we adapt quickly,

12:26.787 --> 12:28.164
or we die the same way.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.332
By "adapt,"

12:31.208 --> 12:34.795
I assume you mean make you richer somehow?

12:36.964 --> 12:38.924
I want you to pay me in cocaine.

12:39.008 --> 12:39.925
[laughing]

12:43.512 --> 12:44.513
Look at you…

12:44.597 --> 12:45.473
[laughs]

12:46.474 --> 12:49.018
Félix's Judas comes for his silver.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.644
[laughs]

12:50.728 --> 12:55.858
You want us to make you
our competitor in the United States?

12:55.941 --> 12:56.775
[Amado] No, sir.

12:56.859 --> 13:00.946
I want all of us to acknowledge the truth.

13:02.031 --> 13:06.577
As we speak, some fucker in a DEA office

13:06.660 --> 13:10.706
is taking down Pablo Escobar's picture
and putting up the three of you.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.754
Cali has a target on its back.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.967
We're <i>businessmen.</i>

13:23.844 --> 13:25.304
Escobar…

13:25.387 --> 13:27.139
was a savage. Understood?

13:27.806 --> 13:28.807
I understand.

13:29.683 --> 13:33.145
But to the gringos, we're all savages.

13:33.938 --> 13:40.903
But if we do this, your exposure in
the U.S. gets cut in half.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.030
How's that?

13:43.113 --> 13:45.574
Your cash-flow becomes
completely internal.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.159
Huh.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.913
And then you and I sit down
and negotiate our prices and territories,

13:50.996 --> 13:52.540
so we never compete.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.460
We create what assholes
like Escobar and Felix

13:56.544 --> 13:58.587
could never get their head around…

14:00.381 --> 14:03.259
a true alliance.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.639
A business agreement between men.
To build and profit together.

14:09.974 --> 14:13.644
Not some bullshit bargain
between psychopaths.

14:13.727 --> 14:17.314
Let me ask you this,
Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.901
If Escobar hadn't died,

14:22.027 --> 14:24.989
would you still be sitting here,
making this proposal?

14:25.072 --> 14:26.448
Absolutely, Chepe.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.660
It's just that fate agrees with me.

14:32.955 --> 14:36.125
The world is changing.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.340
You work hard.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.510
You're respectful, for a Mexican.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.306
You understand this business we've chosen.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.182
And you're right.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.477
We've been talking about
making some changes.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.231
But I suspect you knew that.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.113
We'll talk.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.326
We'll be in touch.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.338
Win or lose, that was a hell of a show.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.466
But if Gilberto doesn't go for it,

15:26.634 --> 15:28.218
don't ask me again.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.764
Keep your phone on.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.934
And stay put 'til we call.

15:37.603 --> 15:38.896
[crowd cheering on TV]

15:41.482 --> 15:43.484
[indistinct Spanish dialogue on TV]

16:00.709 --> 16:02.127
[Benjamín] <i>How is she today?</i>

16:02.211 --> 16:03.170
[video game beeping]

16:03.712 --> 16:05.506
I put some eggs in there a while ago.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.883
Don't think she was awake.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.386
Talk to Amado?

16:10.970 --> 16:11.887
No.

16:11.971 --> 16:12.805
[Ramón sighs]

16:12.888 --> 16:14.723
He's out of town, apparently.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.976
Well, you tried. I'm done waiting!

16:17.059 --> 16:18.435
I'm gonna try again, Ramón.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.146
I need to know where he stands.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.106
[door opens]

16:23.816 --> 16:25.359
Hey, Enedina…

16:29.530 --> 16:31.365
You should eat that, you'll feel better.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.786
Is Chapo Guzman dead?

16:36.412 --> 16:37.287
[inhales sharply]

16:37.830 --> 16:39.081
We're on it.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.165
He's been on the move.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.002
-We got guys looking--
-Hey, hey.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.670
-[door slams]
-[banging on door] Enedina!

16:45.546 --> 16:47.923
I'll make this right.
I'm gonna kill him for you.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.300
Now what, bro?

16:51.760 --> 16:53.095
Keep waiting?

16:54.888 --> 16:56.515
[breathes heavily]

16:58.058 --> 16:59.560
Fuck everyone.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.604
I want Chapo's head.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.651
Tell Barron
I want his fucking guys here <i>now.</i>

17:20.748 --> 17:22.541
<i>To build an army, he turned to the guy</i>

17:22.624 --> 17:25.044
<i>who came up big at the night club attack.</i>

17:25.127 --> 17:26.920
<i>By saving the Arellano brothers,</i>

17:27.004 --> 17:30.507
<i>David Barron set</i>
<i>a new kind of alliance into motion.</i>

17:30.591 --> 17:35.304
<i>He was born and raised just over</i>

17:35.387 --> 17:38.557
<i>He was locked up</i>
<i>in San Quentin at the age of 16</i>

<i>for killing a guy</i>

17:41.477 --> 17:43.020

17:47.399 --> 17:48.776

17:54.656 --> 17:55.991
-Damn.
-Fuckin' power.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.201
Love that shit, man.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.494
[narrator] <i>What could go wrong?</i>

17:58.577 --> 18:00.370
[in Spanish] I promise.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.914
You have my word.

18:01.997 --> 18:02.831
Yes?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.417
Thank you so much.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.294
I'll call you back, bye.

18:07.836 --> 18:08.670
Hey.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.048
-Santos wants to kill the photo.
-Are you kidding?

18:12.007 --> 18:14.176
The public needs to see these images.

18:14.259 --> 18:17.096
To understand what the Narcojuniors
are becoming.

18:17.179 --> 18:21.558
It's sensationalism. We have no right.

18:21.642 --> 18:22.518
Who do you think you are?

18:22.601 --> 18:24.978
This is the truth.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.065
[Salgado] Enough.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.192
Run the picture without the body.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.531
[chuckles] Thank you.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.284
You're not in charge
of this paper, Andrea.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.045
[Salgado] Andrea.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.588
Take a seat.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.931
Why don't I have your copy yet?

19:01.849 --> 19:05.686
Told me you were close on the Arellanos
bankrolling the city fathers.

19:05.769 --> 19:06.979
I'm still on it…

19:07.855 --> 19:11.108
It's not print-ready. But I have them.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.610
Let's hear it.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.362
It was at the casino.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.697
At Vista De Oro.

19:17.239 --> 19:21.827
I tracked the businessmen
I saw with Benjamín Arellano.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.787
Names, finances.

19:23.871 --> 19:28.458
The AFO is definitely bankrolling them.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.879
But I kept thinking…

19:31.962 --> 19:33.839
Why there? Why Vista De Oro?

19:33.922 --> 19:36.300
So I went back.

19:37.467 --> 19:41.263
Kept my eyes on it. No Benjamín,

19:41.346 --> 19:44.308
but the Juniors were regulars.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.727
Which, no big deal. But…

19:46.810 --> 19:48.854
on different days,

19:48.937 --> 19:51.607
I saw two of Benjamín's
business buddies show up

19:51.690 --> 19:53.942
on the casino floor
and get escorted to an office.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.653
When they came out,
they were carrying stacks of chips.

19:57.821 --> 20:01.742
Benjamín needs to clean his money.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.328
What better way than a casino?

20:04.411 --> 20:07.706
He couldn't do it
without the casino's knowledge.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.166
No…

20:09.249 --> 20:10.709
Not a chance.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.673
So you looked
into Vista De Oro's ownership?

20:16.757 --> 20:17.633
Yeah.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.593
Has several investors.

20:19.676 --> 20:24.890
But it's primarily backed
by a conglomerate under--

20:24.973 --> 20:26.433
Carlos Hank Gonzalez.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.727
Look, I get why you wouldn't want to…

20:28.810 --> 20:29.770
Wait.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.778
We'll take it in pieces.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.616
Write up what's ready
to go on the business,

20:44.243 --> 20:46.119
and we'll map out next steps.

20:47.829 --> 20:48.747
Yes.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.125
Thanks.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.046

20:58.006 --> 20:59.091
Talk to me before you go any further.

20:59.716 --> 21:02.511
We'll only get one shot at Hank.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.388
You got it.

dead.

She was torn up pretty bad.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.414
She was choked, I think.

Celebrate tonight.

But tomorrow, get ready.

Because the other Plazas
are gonna find out what you've done,

<i>and they won't be toasting your success.</i>

-No?
-No.

27:37.197 --> 27:39.991
I don't drink a lot of rum.

27:40.658 --> 27:43.161
Okay, well, keep practicing.

27:54.672 --> 27:55.965
Can I get you something?

27:56.049 --> 27:56.925
[chuckles]

27:57.967 --> 27:59.010
Nothing.

28:00.470 --> 28:01.388
It's free.

28:03.556 --> 28:08.353
Oh, I'll have to make it up to you
some other way then.

28:09.646 --> 28:10.480
Why?

28:10.563 --> 28:12.232
I saw you playing piano earlier.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.068
Was my fault you had to stay late.

28:16.194 --> 28:17.028
[Marta] That was you?

28:17.112 --> 28:18.238
Yes, it was.

28:23.868 --> 28:24.744
Right.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.664
Sorry 'bout that.

28:28.665 --> 28:29.666
[Marta] So, how?

28:33.169 --> 28:34.045
How what?

28:34.129 --> 28:34.963
[scoffs]

28:36.840 --> 28:38.758
How you gonna "make it up to me"?

[boxing and grunting]

28:46.224 --> 28:47.892
[Beltran] Looking good, bro.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.354
[Chapo] What the fuck, Arturo?

28:52.021 --> 28:54.232
I gotta get the fuck outta here.
I'm going crazy!

28:54.315 --> 28:55.567
[Beltran] I know, man. This sucks.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.362
But Palma says we gotta be cool.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.281
Stay outta sight, man.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.408
What'd you find out about Amado?

29:04.576 --> 29:08.788
Got some new numbers guy, Corral. Prick.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.665
Says Amado isn't in town,

29:11.916 --> 29:13.877
but should be back in Juarez soon.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.465
How <i>soon?</i>

29:19.716 --> 29:21.801
Day or two. I don't know.

29:29.809 --> 29:34.272
We meet him in Juarez,
he won't turn us down in person.

29:35.315 --> 29:38.526
We need to put
Sinaloa back in fucking business.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.029
[scoffs] What about staying put, boss?

29:44.324 --> 29:45.450
Fuck that.

29:49.245 --> 29:51.080
Why'd you come with me last night?

29:57.462 --> 29:59.172
'Cause you were embarrassed.

30:03.676 --> 30:04.636
[chuckles]

30:04.719 --> 30:08.306
And I don't think you're the type
that gets embarrassed much.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.522
Where you grew up, what was it like?

30:16.356 --> 30:17.690
[grunts]

30:18.691 --> 30:23.655
A small town in northern Mexico.
In the mountains…

30:24.989 --> 30:25.949
Um…

30:26.741 --> 30:28.326
Poor, you know.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.495
[chuckles]

30:33.706 --> 30:34.707
Miss it?

30:35.667 --> 30:37.043
The mountains, yes.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.379
Being poor, no.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.886
You grew up here, Havana?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.430
That's right.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.224
Born and raised.

30:52.392 --> 30:53.935
The ocean's nice.

30:55.061 --> 30:56.563
There's something about it.

30:57.856 --> 30:58.898
So they say.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.946
Know what else is nice?

31:17.375 --> 31:19.586
[Corral] <i>Boss, what's going on?</i>

31:19.669 --> 31:22.213
<i>Thought you were coming back yesterday!</i>

31:22.297 --> 31:24.173
[Amado] <i>Change of plans. What's up?</i>

31:24.924 --> 31:26.718
[Corral] <i>Tijuana and Sinaloa</i>
<i>are in open war.</i>

31:26.801 --> 31:29.220
<i>They need to know where Juárez stands.</i>

31:30.471 --> 31:32.974
<i>Chapo's guys are asking questions</i>
<i>I can't answer.</i>

31:34.726 --> 31:37.478
<i>Decisions need to be made here</i>
<i>that I can't make.</i>

31:39.105 --> 31:40.023
<i>Boss…</i>

31:41.608 --> 31:44.569
I don't think we can push
your flight back anymore.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.362
I'll be back soon.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.323
Get those numbers
for the next meeting ready.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.699
That's all that matters.

31:49.782 --> 31:53.119
[Amado] <i>Our deal with Cali won't mean shit</i>
<i>if he doesn't go for this.</i>

31:53.786 --> 31:54.913
I'll call when I land.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.383
<i>-</i>[Ramón] <i>Bro.</i>
-Ramón.

32:07.467 --> 32:08.676
<i>Put Benjamín on.</i>

32:08.760 --> 32:10.428
Hold on. Benjamín!

32:10.511 --> 32:11.679
Benjamín!

32:12.764 --> 32:13.598
[Benjamín] <i>What's up, Mon?</i>

32:13.681 --> 32:15.058
I think we got him.

32:15.141 --> 32:18.102
<i>I got a cop that says Chapo's</i>
<i>supposed to fly outta Guadalajara.</i>

32:18.186 --> 32:20.980
Leaving through
the airport tomorrow at 4:30.

32:22.148 --> 32:23.983
<i>He called for a police escort.</i>

32:24.943 --> 32:26.110
[Benjamín] Tomorrow?

32:26.194 --> 32:28.237
Can you set something up that fast?

32:29.447 --> 32:30.573
[Ramón] Fuck!

32:30.698 --> 32:31.532
[shushes]

32:31.616 --> 32:33.159
Hey, quiet the fuck down!

32:34.118 --> 32:35.662
[Benjamín] <i>What's up, buddy?</i>

32:35.745 --> 32:37.956
Right, tomorrow. I'm working on it.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.583
So if Barron and that army
get the fuck down here,

32:40.667 --> 32:43.962
<i>we can start sending</i>
<i>the right kind of fucking message.</i>

32:46.214 --> 32:48.675
Don't worry, bro. I'm handling it.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.760
Hey.

32:50.843 --> 32:51.719
Thanks, Mon.

33:00.561 --> 33:01.604
Tomorrow?

33:03.731 --> 33:04.691
Yeah.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.317
Tomorrow.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.696
So what <i>is</i> your fucking job exactly,

33:09.779 --> 33:11.739
if not keeping track of bodies?

33:12.573 --> 33:16.285
I keep track of bodies people
might come looking for.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.539
Sounds like yours didn't fit the bill.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.166
This girl I saw was a murder.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.293
Wouldn't you have to…

33:24.377 --> 33:26.879
write a report?

33:27.422 --> 33:28.256
[chuckles]

33:29.590 --> 33:32.969
And this is a different one than
you were looking for last time?

33:33.052 --> 33:34.429
Like I said…

33:37.348 --> 33:39.684
Right. See this guy?

33:40.393 --> 33:43.438
Wife and son found him dead.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.940
They own a ranch, pay taxes.

33:47.108 --> 33:50.403
And you're asking about
some dead girl in an alley?

33:50.486 --> 33:51.446
Please.

34:02.623 --> 34:04.500
Take a look for me.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.381
<i>Think this is her.</i>

34:13.593 --> 34:14.844
[coughs]

34:17.388 --> 34:19.599
Fucking refrigerator's still down,
can you believe it?

34:20.183 --> 34:21.350
[grunts]

34:21.434 --> 34:24.270
Can keep 'em two or three days at most,

34:24.353 --> 34:26.355
then we get rid of 'em.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.445
That mean she was strangled?

34:33.571 --> 34:34.947
Could be.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.949
Seems like it at least.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.242
What's that?

34:42.830 --> 34:44.248
Stuff she had on her.

35:04.393 --> 35:07.438
Guys on the truck usually take the cash.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.162
Last time I was in here,

35:24.205 --> 35:26.415
there were other bodies, right?

35:26.499 --> 35:27.875
-Yes.
-Hmm.

35:28.876 --> 35:31.212
Those girls were about the same age.

35:34.715 --> 35:40.429
They died like this one?

35:43.683 --> 35:45.143
Can't say for sure.

35:46.227 --> 35:48.062
Probably one or two of 'em, yeah.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.355
Hmm.

35:49.438 --> 35:53.401
What, think someone's got a type?

36:02.160 --> 36:03.286
[Victor] What's this?

36:05.163 --> 36:06.164
Hmm?

36:07.415 --> 36:10.084
Guess she worked at one of the factories.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.752
Bunch of 'em going up.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.130
Can I keep this?

36:14.881 --> 36:15.756
Sure.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.226
[in English] Deep dish,
you got hot dogs there. But…

36:28.644 --> 36:32.857
Harold's Chicken,
with the sauce. Change your life.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.401
-I'll put that one on the list, too.
-Do it.

36:35.985 --> 36:37.445
So, you wanted to talk?

36:41.157 --> 36:42.658
Piece of advice.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.623
Let Dani know who you are.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.958
Sooner rather than later.

36:51.542 --> 36:52.376
[scoffs]

36:53.169 --> 36:55.880
-Dani knows who I am.
-She knows this guy.

36:57.256 --> 36:59.425
She doesn't know the guy
who trashed the office.

37:00.676 --> 37:01.969
And hunted Félix.

37:03.304 --> 37:06.349
Look, I'm not trying to sow doubts,
I'm just trying to save you pain.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.685
There used to be
a wedding ring on this finger.

37:12.271 --> 37:15.441
Why don't you just
come out with what you're saying?

37:16.275 --> 37:17.443
I think I have.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.321
[waitress] Here you go.

37:22.823 --> 37:24.033
Burger and fries.

37:27.245 --> 37:31.040
You tell Dani about Mexico?
The shit you got into?

37:37.964 --> 37:38.798
[sighs]

37:40.049 --> 37:45.137
When I reported back from Guadalajara
after Kiki, they sent me to a shrink.

37:46.013 --> 37:48.099
Mandatory. And I fucking hated it.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.727
Because the guy knew
what he was talking about.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.729
He knew what was happening with me.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.943
You owe it to Dani to be clear about
who you are and what you've been through.

37:59.026 --> 38:00.903
Or you're as good as lying already.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.076
Just a piece of advice, Walt.

38:10.871 --> 38:12.373
[grunts]

38:16.919 --> 38:17.837
[exhales]

38:29.515 --> 38:30.558
[in Spanish] You're leaving today?

38:31.434 --> 38:32.643
Yes, I'm leaving.

38:33.769 --> 38:34.812
Finally.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.150
You sure?

38:40.359 --> 38:44.655
Have to make a meeting.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.034
Okay.

38:49.201 --> 38:52.371
Just let me know where to send the money.

38:54.832 --> 38:55.958
[chuckles]

39:22.193 --> 39:23.736
[sighs]

39:23.819 --> 39:25.738
[whispering] This was nice.

39:30.785 --> 39:31.911
Thank you.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.589
All right, I'm leaving.

39:47.009 --> 39:47.885
[door opens]

39:53.265 --> 39:55.351
-[Beltran] Move it, assholes.
-[car starting]

39:55.434 --> 39:57.478
Gotta get the fuck out of here.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.772
[bodyguard] Hurry, open the gate.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.085
[Beltran] Flight leaves at 4:30.

40:21.168 --> 40:22.503
We're on time.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.008
[Ramón] Get ready. Let's do this.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.094
[man speaking indistinctly over radio]

40:39.603 --> 40:42.022
Gonna take my guys inside.
We'll keep watch out front.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.316
You guys go park. Watch the lot.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.277
Once you see him, you know what to do.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.194
Got it.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.195
Stay alert.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.363
[Barron] Let's go.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.870
Chivo, stay here. Keep lookout.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.037
Yeah, sure.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.330
[Barron] Let's go.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.250
[Chapo] What's going on today?

41:01.333 --> 41:02.918
It a fucking holiday?

41:03.002 --> 41:04.336
[Beltran] It's my niece's birthday.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.172
[Chapo] Oh, that's why it's so crowded.

41:19.101 --> 41:20.227
Let me get that, boss.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.353
Thanks.

41:24.523 --> 41:25.941
[Beltran] So, you go to Juaréz…

41:26.942 --> 41:27.985
then what?

41:28.068 --> 41:29.278
[sighs]

41:29.361 --> 41:31.655
Depends on Amado, I guess.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.658
[Beltran] These are our guys.

41:37.077 --> 41:37.995
[Chapo] Hello, officer.

41:38.078 --> 41:38.996
Mr. Guzman.

41:41.916 --> 41:42.958
[officer] That your only bag, sir?

41:43.042 --> 41:43.918
Yeah.

41:44.001 --> 41:44.835
Good to go.

41:56.388 --> 41:58.891
[Chivo] Guys, I see him.

41:58.974 --> 42:00.309
Chapo's outside.

42:00.392 --> 42:02.645
I see him. He's with two cops.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.648
[Ramón] <i>Hit him, Chivo!</i>

42:06.524 --> 42:07.858
<i>Do it!</i>

42:09.109 --> 42:10.069
[gun fires]

42:10.152 --> 42:11.320
[Beltran] Chapo!

42:13.614 --> 42:15.241
[woman screams]

42:19.036 --> 42:20.496
They killed Chivo!

42:23.541 --> 42:24.667
Son of a bitch!

42:31.757 --> 42:32.758
[woman screaming]

42:34.927 --> 42:35.844
Hurry!

42:38.347 --> 42:39.473
[Beltran] Let's go, man!

42:39.557 --> 42:40.474
[Chapo] Get the car.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.903
Go! Go!

42:53.571 --> 42:54.655
Step on it!

42:54.738 --> 42:55.948
White Grand Marquis!

42:56.031 --> 42:57.283
[Ramón] <i>Get the fuck out here!</i>

42:57.366 --> 42:58.200
Got it.

42:58.284 --> 42:59.326
Understood.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.453
[Barron in English] Get ready, dawg?

43:01.537 --> 43:03.163
Hurry up! Pass 'em out, pass 'em out.

43:03.747 --> 43:06.292
[in Spanish] When you see the white
Grand Marquis, fire at will!

43:06.375 --> 43:07.501
[in English] Light that motherfucker up!

43:07.585 --> 43:08.794
[in Spanish] Let's go!

43:11.797 --> 43:12.923
[gunshots]

43:13.048 --> 43:14.633
[indistinct shouting]

43:14.717 --> 43:16.343
[Chapo] Get us out of here!

43:16.427 --> 43:18.887
[Beltran] Trying. Fuck!

43:20.139 --> 43:21.599
Motherfucker!

43:23.142 --> 43:24.310
Back up!

43:27.104 --> 43:27.980
[Beltran] We're stuck.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.447
[in English] Got you, bitch.

43:36.530 --> 43:37.865
[car alarms blaring]

43:41.368 --> 43:42.202
[in Spanish] They're coming, bro.

43:55.382 --> 43:56.550
[in English] That's fuckin' him.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.135
[guns firing]

44:16.570 --> 44:17.738
[in Spanish] He's gone.

44:19.573 --> 44:20.991
Fuck.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.246
[Barron in English] Who the fuck is that?

44:30.542 --> 44:31.502

44:31.585 --> 44:34.672
-[police siren wailing indistinctly]
-[shushes]

44:36.423 --> 44:37.633
[Ramón over radio] <i>Barron…</i>

44:37.716 --> 44:39.927
<i>he's not fucking here.</i>

44:40.010 --> 44:41.804
<i>Keep looking!</i>

44:41.887 --> 44:43.639
Got it. Understood.

44:43.722 --> 44:45.724

To the terminal. Let's go!

44:45.808 --> 44:46.892
[in Spanish] Let's go!

45:22.469 --> 45:23.470
Not him.

45:25.180 --> 45:26.598
Where the fuck are you, Chapo?

45:27.349 --> 45:28.892
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

45:34.523 --> 45:36.150
Check if he's over there.

47:23.799 --> 47:25.968
[in English] Let's go!
Get the fuck out of here. Come on!

47:26.718 --> 47:27.886
[in Spanish] Fuck!

47:27.970 --> 47:29.263
[Barron in English] We gotta go.

47:37.563 --> 47:38.480
That car…

47:42.734 --> 47:45.404
-Get the fuck out of the car!
-[driver grunting]

47:49.491 --> 47:50.409
[panting]

48:00.794 --> 48:02.629
[police sirens wailing in the distance]

48:06.466 --> 48:11.888
[male reporter 1] <i>This afternoon at</i>
<i>approximately 4:15 p.m. Central time</i>

48:11.972 --> 48:15.392
<i>a shootout broke out at</i>
<i>Guadalajara International Airport…</i>

48:15.475 --> 48:16.977
[male reporter 2 in English]
<i>Mexican authorities</i>

48:17.060 --> 48:18.937
<i>are still trying to figure out</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

48:19.021 --> 48:22.566
<i>One theory, that rival gangs</i>
<i>of drug traffickers were shooting it out,</i>

48:22.649 --> 48:24.860
<i>seems to be the most plausible…</i>

48:24.943 --> 48:25.986
Dad!

48:26.069 --> 48:28.322
[male reporter 1 in Spanish]
<i>And amidst the victims,</i>

48:28.405 --> 48:30.907
<i>Arch-Bishop Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo…</i>

48:30.991 --> 48:33.160
[male reporter 2 in English]
<i>One of the most important men in Mexico,</i>

48:33.243 --> 48:34.244
<i>a beloved figure,</i>

48:34.328 --> 48:38.081
<i>the country's highest-ranking church</i>
<i>leader, cut down in broad daylight.</i>

48:38.165 --> 48:40.000
[female reporter speaking in French]

48:42.669 --> 48:45.130
[in English] A man of God
who fell victim to the evil of the world.

48:45.213 --> 48:47.257
The Cardinal was one
of seven people killed

48:47.341 --> 48:50.844
in the cross fire of a shootout
apparently between rival drug gangs.

48:52.929 --> 48:55.432
[male reporter 2 in Spanish]
<i>A stunning outburst of violence</i>

48:55.515 --> 48:58.393
<i>has struck at the foundation of</i>
<i>the country's most revered institution,</i>

48:58.477 --> 49:00.312
<i>the Catholic Church.</i>

49:00.395 --> 49:03.231
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>drug trafficking has arrived.</i>

49:03.315 --> 49:04.483
[male reporter 3 in Spanish]
<i>Until this moment,</i>

49:04.566 --> 49:08.612
<i>the shooting started</i>
<i>at the airport lounge.</i>

49:08.695 --> 49:14.493
<i>According to various sources,</i>
<i>a group of 15 to 20 men started shooting.</i>

49:14.576 --> 49:19.081
<i>Other men fired back</i>
<i>and some people ran outside,</i>

49:19.164 --> 49:22.668
<i>followed by other shooters.</i>

49:25.462 --> 49:26.838
We're sending you down there.

49:28.173 --> 49:29.633
This will change everything.

49:30.467 --> 49:33.095
[in English] <i>Police believe</i>
<i>Cardinal Juan Posadas Ocampo,</i>

49:33.220 --> 49:37.349
<i>the archbishop of Guadalajara, was simply</i>
<i>in the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

49:37.432 --> 49:39.893
[female reporter 2] <i>Millions upon millions</i>
<i>of its citizens</i>

49:39.976 --> 49:41.061
<i>look to the Catholic church</i>

49:41.144 --> 49:44.022
<i>over their government</i>
<i>as the true leaders of the country.</i>

49:55.992 --> 49:58.120
[Hank] Was surprised
to receive your proposal.

50:01.540 --> 50:03.458
Good to see you, Mr. Hank.

50:04.084 --> 50:06.837
This'll be quick.
Have a lot of calls to make tonight.

50:07.754 --> 50:11.967
Your numbers are interesting.
But the timing, after what happened today…

50:13.552 --> 50:15.637
So, you haven't seen the news, then?

50:16.805 --> 50:18.014
I have.

50:19.433 --> 50:21.810
What I'm seeing right now
is an opportunity.

50:22.728 --> 50:25.522
I just reached a new agreement
with my suppliers.

50:26.773 --> 50:29.109
I'm entering the wholesale
business in America.

50:31.945 --> 50:33.280
[Hank] You're suggesting a partnership?

50:34.072 --> 50:35.615
Yeah, I am.

50:35.699 --> 50:38.285
With the percentage you'll get
for cleaning my money,

50:38.368 --> 50:40.203
plus fees for use of your
transportation lines…

50:40.287 --> 50:42.998
The numbers speak for themselves.

50:43.915 --> 50:47.377
This would seem an odd time
to re-invest in the narcotics business

50:47.461 --> 50:50.881
given the probable reaction
to the Cardinal, don't you think?

50:52.299 --> 50:53.216
But,

50:53.300 --> 50:54.843
If you wanted to avoid problems,

50:54.926 --> 50:56.470
you shouldn't have gone into business

50:56.553 --> 50:58.680
with an organization
like the Arellanos in the first place.

51:01.641 --> 51:04.311
I'm guessing you already cut ties
with those idiots.

51:05.187 --> 51:08.857
Tijuana and Sinaloa
are in the spotlight now. Good.

51:11.777 --> 51:13.862
What I'm offering…

51:14.529 --> 51:16.531
is an operation built to <i>avoid</i> headlines,

51:16.615 --> 51:21.787
conflicts, changes in public favor…

51:22.954 --> 51:23.789
[sighs]

51:24.790 --> 51:27.542
If those bastards want to start a war,

51:27.626 --> 51:29.336
let them start it.

51:30.754 --> 51:32.422
While they're killing each other,

51:32.506 --> 51:37.469
we build whatever we want. Quietly.

51:38.094 --> 51:40.096
And when the spotlight moves off them?

51:41.264 --> 51:42.432
It won't.

51:42.516 --> 51:43.934
Don't worry.

51:45.393 --> 51:48.146
Chaos brings opportunities.

51:52.442 --> 51:53.276
[whistles]

51:53.360 --> 51:54.528
[footsteps approaching]

51:57.113 --> 51:59.032
-[waiter] Sir?
-I'll have what he's having.

52:04.746 --> 52:06.748
[closing theme playing]
