04:06.193 --> 04:08.361
Give me your hand!

04:12.576 --> 04:14.201
Give me your hand.

04:42.939 --> 04:47.360
- I thought you said no more aches or pains.
- It's this darned corset. It binds.

04:47.944 --> 04:50.947
No three-way stretch? How very un-chic.

04:51.490 --> 04:55.326
You know the police department doctors.
No sense of style.

04:56.370 --> 04:58.663
Anyway, tomorrow will be the day.

04:58.954 --> 05:00.456
What's tomorrow?

05:00.706 --> 05:03.084
The corset comes off tomorrow.

05:03.752 --> 05:06.213
I'll be able to scratch myself tomorrow.

05:06.338 --> 05:11.134
I'll throw this miserable thing
out the window. I'll be a free man.

05:12.552 --> 05:15.096
Midge, do you suppose
many men wear corsets?

05:15.471 --> 05:17.432
- More than you think.
- Really?

05:17.557 --> 05:20.394
Do you know that
from personal experience or...

05:20.644 --> 05:21.812
Please.

05:22.896 --> 05:25.939
- What happens after tomorrow?
- What do you mean?

05:26.149 --> 05:29.987
What are you going to do
once you've quit the police force?

05:31.321 --> 05:34.574
- You sound so disapproving, Midge.
- No. It's your life.

05:34.699 --> 05:37.076
You were the bright, young lawyer
who decided...

05:37.201 --> 05:39.870
...he was going to be
chief of police someday.

05:39.997 --> 05:42.331
- I had to quit.
- Why?

05:42.790 --> 05:46.293
Because of this fear of heights I have,
this acrophobia.

05:46.420 --> 05:49.172
I wake up at night seeing that man fall
from the roof...

05:49.298 --> 05:51.716
...and I try to reach out to him and...

05:52.091 --> 05:55.512
- It wasn't your fault.
- That's what everybody tells me.

05:55.887 --> 05:59.641
- Johnny, the doctors explained to you-
- I know, I know.

06:00.016 --> 06:03.687
I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo, and I get dizzy.

06:04.437 --> 06:07.107
What a moment to find out I had it.

06:07.274 --> 06:11.737
You've got it, and there's no losing it.
And there's no one to blame. So why quit?

06:11.862 --> 06:14.531
You mean, and sit behind a desk,
chair-borne?

06:14.906 --> 06:18.576
- Where you belong.
- What about my acrophobia?

06:18.701 --> 06:21.954
Suppose I'm sitting in this chair,
behind a desk.

06:22.204 --> 06:24.665
A pencil falls from the desk
down to the floor...

06:24.790 --> 06:28.127
...and I reach down to pick it up,
bingo, my acrophobia's back.

06:30.963 --> 06:32.716
What'll you do?

06:33.300 --> 06:35.968
I'm not gonna do anything for a while.

06:36.218 --> 06:40.182
Don't forget, I'm a man
of independent means, as the saying goes.

06:40.307 --> 06:41.725
Fairly independent.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.228
Why don't you go away for a while?

06:45.353 --> 06:48.857
You mean, to forget?
Midge, don't be so motherly.

06:50.399 --> 06:52.194
I'm not gonna crack up.

06:52.319 --> 06:56.156
- Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
- I'm having one right now.

06:57.449 --> 07:00.326
Midge, the music.
Don't you think it's sort of...

07:03.788 --> 07:05.624
What's this doohickey?

07:07.918 --> 07:09.502
It's a brassiere.

07:09.711 --> 07:12.673
You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.

07:12.798 --> 07:15.007
I've never run across one like that.

07:15.466 --> 07:18.052
It's brand-new. Revolutionary uplift.

07:18.971 --> 07:23.475
No shoulder straps, no back straps,
but does everything a brassiere should do.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.353
Works on the principle
of the cantilever bridge.

07:26.687 --> 07:27.896
It does?

07:28.271 --> 07:31.274
An aircraft engineer
down the peninsula designed it.

07:31.439 --> 07:33.860
He worked it out in his spare time.

07:34.026 --> 07:35.569
Kind of a hobby.

07:37.531 --> 07:39.783
A do-it-yourself type of thing.

07:42.035 --> 07:43.911
How's your love life, Midge?

07:44.870 --> 07:47.249
That's following a train of thought.

07:47.374 --> 07:48.500
Well?

07:49.668 --> 07:50.836
Normal.

07:51.461 --> 07:53.379
Aren't you ever gonna get married?

07:53.504 --> 07:56.466
You know there's only one man
in the world for me, Johnny-O.

07:56.591 --> 07:59.761
You mean me.
We were engaged once, weren't we?

08:01.430 --> 08:04.348
- Three whole weeks.
- Good old college days.

08:05.725 --> 08:09.269
But you were the one that called off
the engagement, you remember?

08:09.394 --> 08:12.355
I'm still available. Available Ferguson.

08:12.899 --> 08:17.194
Midge, do you remember a fellow
in college by the name of Gavin Elster?

08:17.653 --> 08:19.990
- Gavin Elster?
- Yes, funny name.

08:20.615 --> 08:22.365
You'd think I would? No.

08:24.119 --> 08:28.038
I got a call from Gavin today.
He dropped out of sight during the war.

08:28.163 --> 08:30.957
Somebody said he went East.
I guess he's back.

08:31.168 --> 08:34.504
- It's a Mission number.
- That's Skid Row, isn't it?

08:34.961 --> 08:36.173
Could be.

08:36.548 --> 08:40.091
He's probably on the bum and wants
to touch you for the price of a drink.

08:40.216 --> 08:44.389
Well, I'm on the bum. I'll buy him
a couple drinks and tell him my troubles.

08:44.514 --> 08:47.682
Not tonight. How about you and me
going out for a beer?

08:48.058 --> 08:49.476
Sorry, old man. Work.

08:49.601 --> 08:51.647
Then, I think I'll go home.

08:55.317 --> 08:58.235
Midge, what'd you mean,
there's no losing it?

08:58.695 --> 08:59.738
What?

09:00.864 --> 09:02.365
The acrophobia.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.783
I asked my doctor.

09:05.408 --> 09:09.413
He said that only another emotional shock
could do it and probably wouldn't.

09:09.538 --> 09:12.457
You're not gonna go diving off
another rooftop to find out?

09:12.582 --> 09:14.878
- I think I can lick it.
- How?

09:15.086 --> 09:16.629
I have a theory.

09:16.879 --> 09:21.176
I think if I can get used to heights
just a little bit at a time...

09:22.384 --> 09:24.971
...just a little, like that,
progressively, you see?

09:25.096 --> 09:27.474
I'll show you what I mean. Here.

09:28.850 --> 09:30.600
I'll show you what I mean.

09:31.726 --> 09:33.812
- We'll start with this.
- That?

09:33.937 --> 09:36.899
What do you want me to start with,
the Golden Gate Bridge?

09:37.024 --> 09:38.902
Watch this. Here we go.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.321
There.

09:43.532 --> 09:46.658
Now, I look up, I look down.

09:48.952 --> 09:52.124
- You're kidding. Wait a minute.
- There's nothing to it.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.293
- Here.
- That's a girl.

09:56.086 --> 09:58.504
I'll use that. Put it right there.

10:01.048 --> 10:03.176
All right, here's the first step.

10:05.552 --> 10:07.556
Okay, now step number two.

10:08.514 --> 10:10.517
Step number two coming up.

10:13.854 --> 10:15.272
There we are.

10:15.437 --> 10:18.567
See? I look up, I look down, I look up...

10:18.859 --> 10:21.735
I'm going right out to buy myself
a nice tall stepladder.

10:21.860 --> 10:24.822
- Take it easy now.
- All right, now here we go.

10:25.490 --> 10:26.825
No problem.

10:32.913 --> 10:36.082
Why, this is a cinch.
I look up, I look down.

10:36.835 --> 10:38.961
I look up, I look down.

11:07.908 --> 11:10.909
How did you get in
the shipbuilding business, Gavin?

11:11.620 --> 11:13.245
I married into it.

11:14.998 --> 11:16.956
Very interesting business.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.418
To be honest, I find it dull.

11:19.711 --> 11:21.797
You don't have to do it for a living.

11:21.922 --> 11:24.466
No, but one assumes responsibilities.

11:24.923 --> 11:27.094
My wife's family is all gone.

11:27.344 --> 11:29.888
Someone has to look after her interests.

11:30.096 --> 11:33.767
Her father's partner runs the company yard
in the East. Baltimore.

11:34.933 --> 11:38.897
So I decided, as long as I had to work at it,
I'd come back here.

11:40.023 --> 11:43.360
- I've always liked it here.
- How long have you been back?

11:43.485 --> 11:44.945
Almost a year.

11:45.110 --> 11:46.321
You like it?

11:46.863 --> 11:48.782
San Francisco's changed.

11:49.740 --> 11:53.662
The things that spell San Francisco
to me are disappearing fast.

11:57.081 --> 11:58.331
Like all these.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.918
I should have liked to have lived here then.

12:01.043 --> 12:03.629
Color, excitement, power.

12:04.298 --> 12:05.298
Freedom.

12:07.216 --> 12:09.052
Shouldn't you be sitting down?

12:09.177 --> 12:10.802
No, I'm all right.

12:11.721 --> 12:16.350
I was sorry to read about that thing
in the paper. And you've quit the force.

12:16.600 --> 12:20.230
- Is it a permanent physical disability?
- No, no.

12:20.562 --> 12:24.860
It just means I can't climb stairs
that are too steep or go to high places...

12:25.067 --> 12:27.403
...like the bar at the Top of the Mark.

12:27.528 --> 12:30.197
There are plenty of street-level bars
in this town.

12:30.322 --> 12:32.158
Would you like a drink now?

12:32.701 --> 12:34.369
No, I don't think so.

12:34.534 --> 12:36.870
It's a little early in the day for me.

12:39.624 --> 12:42.668
I guess that covers everything, doesn't it?

12:43.543 --> 12:46.548
I never married,
I don't see much of the old college gang.

12:46.673 --> 12:50.344
I'm a retired detective
and you're in the shipbuilding business.

12:52.385 --> 12:54.139
What's on your mind, Gavin?

12:54.721 --> 12:59.100
I asked you to come up here, Scottie,
knowing that you'd quit detective work...

12:59.644 --> 13:03.855
...but I wondered whether you'd go back
on the job as a special favor to me.

13:04.606 --> 13:06.234
I want you to follow my wife.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.278
No, it's not that.
We're very happily married.

13:09.446 --> 13:12.783
- Well, then...
- I'm afraid some harm may come to her.

13:13.408 --> 13:15.533
- From whom?
- Someone dead.

13:19.498 --> 13:23.125
Scottie, do you believe
that someone out of the past...

13:23.918 --> 13:28.340
...someone dead, can enter
and take possession of a living being?

13:28.755 --> 13:29.758
No.

13:30.801 --> 13:35.263
If I told you I believe this has happened
to my wife, what would you say?

13:35.764 --> 13:39.725
I'd say take her to the nearest psychiatrist
or psychologist...

13:39.850 --> 13:43.897
...or neurologist or...
Or maybe just the plain family doctor.

13:44.437 --> 13:46.606
I'd have him check on you, too.

13:47.484 --> 13:51.071
Then you're of no use to me.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.782
Thanks for coming in, Scottie.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.325
Okay.

13:56.408 --> 13:59.538
I didn't mean to be that rough.

14:00.038 --> 14:02.249
No, it sounds idiotic, I know.

14:02.666 --> 14:05.793
And you're still the hardheaded Scot,
aren't you?

14:05.961 --> 14:09.089
Always were.
Do you think I'm making it up?

14:10.255 --> 14:11.258
No.

14:11.883 --> 14:14.884
I'm not making it up.
I wouldn't know how.

14:16.428 --> 14:18.889
She'll be talking to me about something.

14:19.014 --> 14:21.558
Suddenly the words fade into silence.

14:22.561 --> 14:25.522
A cloud comes into her eyes
and they go blank.

14:27.441 --> 14:30.652
She's somewhere else, away from me,
someone I don't know.

14:31.610 --> 14:34.072
I call to her, she doesn't even hear me.

14:34.904 --> 14:37.365
Then, with a long sigh, she's back.

14:38.201 --> 14:41.580
Looks at me brightly.
Doesn't even know she's been away.

14:41.705 --> 14:43.788
Can't tell me where or when.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.003
How often does this happen?

14:48.128 --> 14:50.297
More and more in the past few weeks.

14:50.422 --> 14:53.383
And she wanders.
God knows where she wanders.

14:55.052 --> 14:57.010
I followed her one day...

14:57.135 --> 15:00.849
...watched her coming out
of the apartment, someone I didn't know.

15:01.642 --> 15:03.725
She even walked a different way.

15:04.644 --> 15:06.312
Got into her car and...

15:06.647 --> 15:09.731
...drove out to Golden Gate Park,
five miles.

15:11.399 --> 15:12.692
Sat by the lake...

15:12.817 --> 15:16.279
...staring across the water at the pillars
that stand on the far shore.

15:16.404 --> 15:18.700
You know, Portals of the Past.

15:19.201 --> 15:21.787
Sat there a long time without moving.

15:22.370 --> 15:24.748
I had to leave, get back to the office.

15:25.248 --> 15:28.460
When I got home that evening,
I asked her what she'd done all day.

15:28.585 --> 15:30.671
She said she'd driven
to Golden Gate Park...

15:30.796 --> 15:32.879
...and sat by the lake, that's all.

15:34.883 --> 15:35.966
Well?

15:37.219 --> 15:40.721
The speedometer on her car showed
that she'd driven 94 miles.

15:41.514 --> 15:43.100
Where did she go?

15:44.518 --> 15:47.394
I've got to know where she goes
and what she does...

15:47.519 --> 15:49.230
...before I get involved with doctors.

15:49.355 --> 15:52.942
- Have you discussed this with the doctors?
- Yes, but carefully.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.239
I want to know more
before committing her to that kind of care.

15:57.654 --> 16:00.740
I'll get you a firm of private eyes
to follow her for you.

16:00.865 --> 16:03.702
- They're dependable, good boys.
- I want you.

16:04.162 --> 16:06.206
Look, this isn't my line.

16:06.956 --> 16:09.418
Scottie, I need a friend,
someone I can trust.

16:09.543 --> 16:11.543
I'm in a panic about this.

16:11.918 --> 16:15.755
I'm supposed to be retired. I don't want
to get mixed up in this darn thing.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.884
Look, we're going to an opening
at the opera tonight.

16:19.009 --> 16:22.346
We're dining at Ernie's first.
You can see her there.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.057
Ernie's.

26:52.269 --> 26:55.480
Say, will you tell me something?
That lady sitting there.

26:55.980 --> 26:58.025
Who's the woman in the painting?

26:58.191 --> 27:02.738
That's Carlotta. You'll find it
in the catalogue. Portrait of Carlotta.

27:03.113 --> 27:04.904
- May I have this?
- Yes.

29:02.647 --> 29:03.650
Yes?

29:09.404 --> 29:11.240
Is there something I can do for you?

29:11.365 --> 29:13.701
- Yes. You run this hotel?
- Yes.

29:14.036 --> 29:16.913
Would you tell me who has the room
on the second floor...

29:17.038 --> 29:18.957
...in the corner, that corner?

29:19.414 --> 29:22.961
I'm afraid we couldn't give out information
of that sort.

29:23.086 --> 29:26.298
Our clients are entitled to their privacy,
you know.

29:26.423 --> 29:29.009
And I do believe it's against the law.

29:29.843 --> 29:33.721
Of course, I don't think any of them
would mind really, but still I-

29:35.347 --> 29:37.517
Has she done something wrong?

29:37.976 --> 29:39.853
Please answer my question.

29:40.019 --> 29:43.355
- I can't imagine that sweet girl-
- What's her name?

29:43.605 --> 29:47.653
- Miss Valdés. Spanish, you know.
- Carlotta Valdés?

29:47.986 --> 29:49.444
Yeah, that's it.

29:49.569 --> 29:52.030
Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign, but sweet.

29:52.155 --> 29:53.700
How long has she had the room?

29:53.825 --> 29:56.993
It must be two weeks.
Her rent's due tomorrow.

29:57.537 --> 29:59.329
Does she sleep here ever?

29:59.454 --> 30:02.709
No, she just comes to sit
two or three times a week.

30:03.460 --> 30:07.255
I don't ask questions, you know,
as long as they're well-behaved.

30:08.256 --> 30:10.548
When she comes down,
don't say I've been here.

30:10.674 --> 30:12.970
But she hasn't been here today.

30:13.470 --> 30:15.512
I just saw her come in five minutes ago.

30:15.637 --> 30:19.432
No, she hasn't been here at all.
I would have seen her.

30:19.683 --> 30:24.064
I've been right here all the time,
putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves.

30:25.691 --> 30:26.982
And there.

30:27.107 --> 30:30.318
You see? Her key is on the rack.

30:30.694 --> 30:33.740
- Would you please go up and look?
- To her room?

30:34.030 --> 30:36.576
- That's right.
- Yes, of course, if you ask.

30:38.161 --> 30:40.622
- But it does seem silly.
- Thank you.

30:58.765 --> 31:00.223
Mr. Detective?

31:03.935 --> 31:05.939
Would you like to come and look?

31:34.718 --> 31:36.678
- Her car's gone.
- What car?

32:08.125 --> 32:09.294
Midge...

32:10.045 --> 32:13.757
...who do you know that's an authority
on San Francisco history?

32:14.423 --> 32:16.384
That's the kind of greeting a girl likes.

32:16.509 --> 32:18.845
None of this:
"Hello, you look wonderful" stuff.

32:18.971 --> 32:21.471
Just, "Do you know an authority
on San Francisco-"

32:21.596 --> 32:23.723
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

32:24.101 --> 32:26.644
Well, who do you? You know everybody.

32:27.394 --> 32:29.564
Professor Saunders over in Berkeley.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.650
No, I don't mean that kind of history.

32:31.775 --> 32:35.653
I mean the small stuff,
people you never heard of.

32:37.779 --> 32:41.451
You mean the gay old bohemian days
of gay old San Francisco.

32:41.866 --> 32:44.913
Juicy stories, like who shot who
in the Embarcadero...

32:45.038 --> 32:47.582
-... in August, 1879.
- Yeah, that's right.

32:47.914 --> 32:49.459
- Pop Leibel.
- Who?

32:49.710 --> 32:52.546
Pop Leibel.
He owns the Argosy Book Shop.

32:53.130 --> 32:54.587
What do you want to know?

32:54.713 --> 32:58.719
I want to know who shot who
in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.

33:00.260 --> 33:03.471
Wait a minute. You're not
a detective anymore. What's going on?

33:03.596 --> 33:05.726
- You know him well?
- Who?

33:06.018 --> 33:07.809
- Pop Leibel.
- Sure.

33:08.435 --> 33:10.730
Come on. I want you to introduce me.

33:10.980 --> 33:13.650
- Get your hat.
- I don't need a hat.

33:16.153 --> 33:18.320
Johnny, what's it all about?

33:22.741 --> 33:24.201
Wait a minute.

33:31.666 --> 33:33.376
Yes, I remember.

33:34.296 --> 33:35.505
Carlotta.

33:36.338 --> 33:38.173
The beautiful Carlotta.

33:39.174 --> 33:40.759
The sad Carlotta.

33:41.134 --> 33:44.181
What does an old house
on the corner of Eddy and Gough...

33:44.306 --> 33:46.098
...have to do with Carlotta Valdés?

33:46.223 --> 33:50.560
It was hers.
It was built for her many years ago.

33:50.728 --> 33:52.563
- By whom?
- By...

33:58.152 --> 34:00.946
No. The name I do not remember.

34:01.364 --> 34:04.076
A rich man. A powerful man.

34:04.992 --> 34:06.494
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

34:06.619 --> 34:08.538
- Cigarette, miss?
- No, thanks.

34:09.998 --> 34:12.041
It is not an unusual story.

34:13.501 --> 34:17.005
She came from somewhere small,
to the south of the city.

34:19.007 --> 34:21.467
Some say from a mission settlement.

34:22.052 --> 34:24.346
Young, yes. Very young.

34:25.764 --> 34:30.893
And she was found dancing and singing
in a cabaret by that man...

34:31.978 --> 34:33.605
...and he took her...

34:34.606 --> 34:38.652
...and built for her the great house
in the Western Addition.

34:40.570 --> 34:41.612
And...

34:42.864 --> 34:44.864
...there was a child.

34:45.409 --> 34:48.619
Yes, that's it. The child. The child.

34:50.079 --> 34:54.333
I cannot tell you
exactly how much time passed...

34:54.793 --> 34:57.170
...or how much happiness there was...

34:57.713 --> 34:59.797
...but then he threw her away.

35:00.840 --> 35:04.052
He had no other children.
His wife had no children.

35:04.844 --> 35:08.681
So, he kept the child and threw her away.

35:10.349 --> 35:13.228
You know, a man could do that
in those days.

35:13.686 --> 35:16.148
They had the power and the freedom.

35:17.398 --> 35:20.152
And she became the sad Carlotta.

35:21.610 --> 35:23.655
Alone in the great house...

35:24.197 --> 35:26.282
...walking the streets alone...

35:26.867 --> 35:30.871
...her clothes becoming old
and patched and dirty.

35:33.039 --> 35:36.293
And, the mad Carlotta...

35:37.878 --> 35:40.588
...stopping people in the streets to ask:

35:41.632 --> 35:43.342
"Where is my child?

35:44.592 --> 35:46.510
"Have you seen my child?"

35:47.971 --> 35:50.222
- Poor thing.
- And she died.

35:51.181 --> 35:52.684
- She died.
- How?

35:53.976 --> 35:55.561
By her own hand.

35:58.981 --> 36:01.108
There are many such stories.

36:01.735 --> 36:03.652
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

36:03.777 --> 36:06.114
- I appreciate it. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

36:06.614 --> 36:09.784
Wait a minute! Good-bye, Pop.
Thanks a lot.

36:17.376 --> 36:20.045
- Now then, Johnny-O, pay me.
- For what?

36:20.210 --> 36:24.132
- For bringing you here. Come on, tell.
- There's nothing to tell.

36:24.257 --> 36:28.219
- You'll tell or be back in that corset.
- Come on. I'll take you home.

36:38.855 --> 36:40.315
There we are.

36:40.523 --> 36:43.193
- You haven't told me everything.
- I've told you enough.

36:43.318 --> 36:46.737
- Who's the guy and who's the wife?
- Out. I've got things to do.

36:46.862 --> 36:50.367
I know. The one that phoned.
Your old college chum, Elster.

36:50.492 --> 36:51.659
Midge, out, please.

36:51.784 --> 36:55.329
The idea is the beautiful, mad Carlotta
has returned from the dead...

36:55.454 --> 36:57.748
...and taken possession of Elster's wife.

36:58.666 --> 37:00.710
Johnny, really. Come on.

37:00.835 --> 37:04.005
I'm not telling you what I think,
I'm telling you what he thinks.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.675
- What do you think?
- Well, I...

37:07.384 --> 37:09.344
- Is she pretty?
- Carlotta?

37:09.844 --> 37:11.972
Not Carlotta. Elster's wife.

37:14.599 --> 37:18.268
Yes. I guess you'd consider
that she would be-

37:18.436 --> 37:21.606
I think I'll go take a look
at that portrait. Good-bye.

37:21.898 --> 37:24.067
- Midge...
- Good-bye!

37:55.056 --> 37:57.643
You've done well, Scottie.
You're good at your job.

37:57.768 --> 37:59.643
- That's Carlotta Valdés.
- Yes.

37:59.768 --> 38:02.230
There are things you didn't tell me.

38:02.563 --> 38:06.068
- I didn't know where she'd lead you.
- But you knew about this.

38:07.277 --> 38:11.114
You notice the way she does her hair?
There's something else.

38:12.032 --> 38:16.369
My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces
of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta.

38:16.494 --> 38:18.163
She inherited them.

38:18.413 --> 38:20.998
Never wore them.
They were too old-fashioned.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.458
Until now.

38:23.376 --> 38:26.838
Now when she's alone,
she takes them out and looks at them...

38:27.255 --> 38:29.590
...handles them gently, curiously...

38:31.050 --> 38:34.262
...puts them on and stares at herself
in the mirror...

38:34.554 --> 38:38.224
...and then goes into that other world,
is someone else again.

38:39.059 --> 38:42.938
Carlotta Valdés was what,
your wife's grandmother?

38:43.730 --> 38:45.148
Great-grandmother.

38:45.523 --> 38:47.733
The child who was taken from her...

38:47.858 --> 38:52.405
...whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to
her death, was Madeleine's grandmother.

38:52.947 --> 38:56.534
And the McKittrick Hotel
is the old Valdés home.

38:58.369 --> 39:00.204
I think that explains it.

39:00.329 --> 39:04.626
Anyone could become obsessed
with the past with a background like that.

39:05.751 --> 39:07.920
She never heard of Carlotta Valdés.

39:08.672 --> 39:11.425
She knows nothing of a grave out
at the Mission Dolores?

39:11.550 --> 39:13.677
Or that old house on Eddy Street?

39:14.385 --> 39:17.347
The portrait at
the Palace of the Legion of...

39:18.014 --> 39:20.684
- Nothing.
- When she goes to these places-

39:20.809 --> 39:22.728
She's no longer my wife.

39:24.521 --> 39:27.190
How do you know
all these things she doesn't?

39:27.398 --> 39:30.485
Her mother told me most of them
before she died.

39:30.652 --> 39:32.487
I dug out the rest for myself here.

39:32.612 --> 39:35.824
- Why wouldn't she tell her daughter?
- Natural fear.

39:36.699 --> 39:39.702
Her grandmother went insane,
took her own life.

39:40.494 --> 39:42.204
Her blood is in Madeleine.

39:49.085 --> 39:50.672
Boy, I need this.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.090
Madeleine.

43:21.590 --> 43:22.884
Madeleine!

44:24.612 --> 44:25.655
Yes?

44:27.989 --> 44:29.701
No, it's all right.

44:30.409 --> 44:32.371
Yeah, I'll call you back.

44:32.954 --> 44:33.996
Yes.

44:38.710 --> 44:39.878
You all right?

44:44.715 --> 44:46.300
You'll want this.

45:21.878 --> 45:25.340
You'd better come over here
by the fire where it's warm.

45:30.262 --> 45:32.054
What am I doing here?

45:33.514 --> 45:34.974
What happened?

45:36.851 --> 45:40.438
Well, you fell into San Francisco Bay.

45:42.648 --> 45:46.152
And I tried to dry your hair as best I could.

45:46.360 --> 45:49.947
Your things are in the kitchen.
They'll be dry in a few minutes.

45:50.364 --> 45:52.326
Come on over by the fire.

46:00.626 --> 46:02.668
I'll get you some cushions.

46:06.297 --> 46:07.547
There you are.

46:15.931 --> 46:18.101
Would you like to have some coffee?

46:20.853 --> 46:24.273
Here, you'd better have some.
Or perhaps you'd like a drink?

46:28.152 --> 46:30.947
I fell into the Bay and you fished me out?

46:31.155 --> 46:32.574
That's right.

46:33.449 --> 46:36.494
- Thank you.
- You don't remember?

46:37.788 --> 46:38.996
No, I...

46:41.291 --> 46:43.460
Do you remember where you were?

46:45.795 --> 46:48.672
Yes. Of course I remember that.

46:51.592 --> 46:54.846
But then I must have had a dizzy spell
and fainted.

46:55.054 --> 46:56.556
Where were you?

46:57.349 --> 47:00.768
At Old Fort Point. Out at the Presidio.

47:02.688 --> 47:05.231
Of course I remember. I often go there.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.317
Why? Why do you go there?

47:08.150 --> 47:11.195
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there.

47:12.364 --> 47:14.114
Especially at sunset.

47:16.492 --> 47:18.327
Thank you for the fire.

47:18.452 --> 47:20.289
Where were you before?

47:20.789 --> 47:23.000
- When?
- This afternoon, I mean.

47:25.126 --> 47:26.460
Wandering about.

47:26.710 --> 47:29.672
I know, but where?
Where were you just before?

47:32.884 --> 47:34.594
Downtown, shopping.

47:36.972 --> 47:39.349
Here, you'd better have some coffee.

47:39.474 --> 47:41.434
I think it's still warm.

47:43.686 --> 47:46.106
You're terribly direct in your questions.

47:46.231 --> 47:48.733
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

47:50.193 --> 47:52.570
You're not. You're merely direct.

47:56.324 --> 47:59.452
And what were you doing there,
at Old Fort Point?

48:00.746 --> 48:02.496
Just wandering about.

48:03.206 --> 48:05.208
- You like it, too?
- Yes.

48:06.626 --> 48:08.795
And where had you been just before?

48:08.920 --> 48:12.797
I'd been to the Palace of the Legion
of Honor, the art gallery.

48:13.550 --> 48:16.219
Yes, that's a lovely spot, isn't it?

48:16.677 --> 48:20.431
I've never been inside,
but it looks so lovely driving past.

48:26.813 --> 48:29.608
It's lucky for me,
you were wandering about.

48:29.983 --> 48:31.275
Thank you.

48:31.443 --> 48:33.320
I've been a terrible bother to you.

48:33.445 --> 48:35.030
No, you haven't.

48:38.532 --> 48:39.867
When you...

48:44.498 --> 48:46.375
There were some pins in my hair.

48:46.500 --> 48:49.460
The pins, yes. Right in here.
I'll get 'em for you.

48:49.585 --> 48:51.338
And my purse, please.

48:56.677 --> 48:58.637
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

49:01.681 --> 49:04.141
You shouldn't have brought me here.

49:04.393 --> 49:06.393
I didn't know where you lived.

49:07.771 --> 49:11.650
You could have looked in my car.
But you didn't know my car, did you?

49:12.067 --> 49:14.735
I knew which one it was.
It's right outside here now.

49:14.820 --> 49:17.989
But I didn't think you wanted
to be taken home that way.

49:18.322 --> 49:19.532
No, you're right.

49:19.657 --> 49:23.077
I'm glad you didn't take me home.
I wouldn't have known you.

49:23.869 --> 49:27.708
Thank you. But I don't know you
and you don't know me.

49:28.125 --> 49:31.378
- My name is Madeleine Elster.
- My name's John Ferguson.

49:31.503 --> 49:35.340
Good, strong name.
Do your friends call you John or Jack?

49:36.257 --> 49:37.675
John, mostly.

49:37.967 --> 49:41.137
Old friends call me John.
Acquaintances call me Scottie.

49:41.929 --> 49:43.724
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.

49:43.849 --> 49:46.143
Gee whiz, I wouldn't like that.

49:47.311 --> 49:51.106
After what happened this afternoon,
I should think you'd call me Scottie.

49:51.231 --> 49:52.773
Maybe even John.

49:53.317 --> 49:54.775
I prefer John.

49:58.405 --> 50:01.324
There, that's done.
And what do you do, John?

50:03.159 --> 50:04.577
I wander about.

50:04.702 --> 50:07.914
That's a good occupation.
And you live here, alone?

50:10.000 --> 50:12.878
- One shouldn't live alone.
- Some people prefer it.

50:15.130 --> 50:16.590
No, it's wrong.

50:19.925 --> 50:21.469
I'm married, you know.

50:25.891 --> 50:30.018
Will you tell me something?
Has this ever happened to you before?

50:30.978 --> 50:31.980
What?

50:32.773 --> 50:35.025
Falling into San Francisco Bay.

50:37.943 --> 50:40.197
No, it's never happened before.

50:40.697 --> 50:44.534
I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats,
when I was a little girl.

50:44.992 --> 50:49.414
I even fell into the river once
trying to leap from one stone to another.

50:49.873 --> 50:52.793
But I've never fallen
into San Francisco Bay.

50:54.085 --> 50:55.835
Have you ever before?

50:56.045 --> 50:58.632
No, it's the first time for me, too.

51:01.342 --> 51:03.512
I'll get you some more coffee.

51:18.402 --> 51:21.070
- Hello?
- What happened? She's not home yet.

51:21.152 --> 51:24.864
She's all right. She's still here.
I'll bring her home soon.

51:25.492 --> 51:27.869
- What happened?
- She went into the Bay.

51:30.998 --> 51:33.250
- Hello? Hello?
- Did she hurt herself?

51:33.458 --> 51:36.043
No, she'll be fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

51:36.168 --> 51:38.713
But she doesn't know. Do you understand?

51:38.963 --> 51:41.215
She doesn't know what happened.

51:44.469 --> 51:46.637
Scottie, Madeleine is 26.

51:47.806 --> 51:50.976
Carlotta Valdés committed suicide
when she was 26.

51:52.518 --> 51:54.646
Just hold on a minute, Gavin.

52:24.259 --> 52:27.179
Well now, Johnny-O. Was it a ghost?

52:28.387 --> 52:29.722
Was it fun?

54:59.206 --> 55:00.916
That letter for me?

55:06.672 --> 55:08.382
- Yes. Hello.
- Hello.

55:09.297 --> 55:13.094
I worried about you last night.
You shouldn't have run off that way.

55:13.427 --> 55:15.722
Well, I suddenly felt such a fool.

55:15.847 --> 55:18.141
I wanted to drive you home.
Are you all right?

55:18.266 --> 55:20.811
Yes, I'm fine. No aftereffects.

55:22.938 --> 55:25.231
As I remember now,
the water was cold, wasn't it?

55:25.356 --> 55:28.485
- It sure was.
- What a terrible thing for me to do.

55:29.110 --> 55:30.695
You were so kind.

55:32.197 --> 55:35.492
It's a formal thank-you note
and a great big apology.

55:35.659 --> 55:38.577
- You've nothing to apologize for.
- Yes, I do.

55:38.786 --> 55:41.373
The whole thing must have been
so embarrassing for you.

55:41.498 --> 55:43.416
Not at all. I enjoyed...

55:45.335 --> 55:46.795
...talking to you.

55:49.130 --> 55:51.090
I enjoyed talking to you.

55:55.262 --> 55:56.887
I'll get my mail.

55:58.639 --> 56:01.851
- Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

56:05.063 --> 56:08.483
I couldn't mail it. I didn't know
your address, but I had a landmark.

56:08.608 --> 56:11.360
I remembered Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.

56:11.485 --> 56:14.655
That's the first time
I've been grateful for Coit Tower.

56:18.909 --> 56:21.163
- I hope we will too.
- What?

56:21.954 --> 56:24.166
- Meet again sometime.
- We have.

56:27.710 --> 56:28.960
Good-bye.

56:45.143 --> 56:46.896
Where are you going?

56:47.563 --> 56:48.565
I don't know.

56:48.690 --> 56:50.150
- Shopping?
- No.

56:50.650 --> 56:52.527
Anywhere in particular?

56:53.945 --> 56:56.072
I just thought that I'd wander.

56:57.157 --> 56:59.367
That's what I was going to do.

57:00.452 --> 57:04.664
That's right. I forgot.
It's your occupation, isn't it?

57:04.998 --> 57:07.668
Don't you think it's a waste
for the two of us...

57:07.751 --> 57:09.503
To wander separately?

57:10.085 --> 57:12.088
But only one is a wanderer.

57:12.213 --> 57:14.547
Two together are always
going somewhere.

57:14.675 --> 57:17.260
I don't think that's necessarily true.

57:18.135 --> 57:21.389
- You left your door open.
- Be right back.

58:05.309 --> 58:06.393
How old?

58:06.601 --> 58:08.853
Some 2,000 years or more.

58:09.771 --> 58:12.023
- The oldest living things.
- Yes.

58:13.358 --> 58:15.818
- You've never been here before?
- No.

58:16.445 --> 58:18.070
What are you thinking?

58:18.739 --> 58:21.282
Of all the people who've been born
and have died...

58:21.407 --> 58:23.117
...while the trees went on living.

58:23.242 --> 58:27.414
Their true name is Sequoia sempervirens.
"Always green, ever living. "

58:28.123 --> 58:30.041
- I don't like them.
- Why?

58:31.043 --> 58:32.585
Knowing I have to die.

58:48.643 --> 58:52.438
Here's a cross section of one
of the old trees that's been cut down.

59:19.590 --> 59:21.842
Somewhere in here I was born...

59:24.346 --> 59:25.972
...and there I died.

59:27.056 --> 59:29.226
It was only a moment for you.

59:30.059 --> 59:31.728
You took no notice.

59:41.280 --> 59:42.322
Madeleine.

01:00:30.369 --> 01:00:32.539
Madeleine, where are you now?

01:00:33.706 --> 01:00:35.541
- Here with you.
- Where?

01:00:36.793 --> 01:00:39.755
- The tall trees...
- Have you been here before?

01:00:40.172 --> 01:00:41.505
- Yes.
- When?

01:00:43.634 --> 01:00:45.302
When were you born?

01:00:46.177 --> 01:00:47.762
- Long ago.
- Where?

01:00:48.597 --> 01:00:50.264
When? Tell me.

01:00:50.766 --> 01:00:52.309
- Madeleine, tell me.
- No!

01:00:52.434 --> 01:00:55.518
- Where do you go? What takes you away?
- I can't tell you.

01:00:55.646 --> 01:00:58.565
When you jumped into the Bay,
you didn't know where you were.

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:01.818
- I didn't jump. You told me I fell.
- Why did you jump?

01:01:02.027 --> 01:01:05.655
- I can't tell you.
- What was inside that told you to jump?

01:01:06.155 --> 01:01:07.574
- Please.
- What?

01:01:07.824 --> 01:01:09.576
Please, don't ask me.

01:01:11.452 --> 01:01:13.329
Take me away from here.

01:01:14.164 --> 01:01:15.998
Shall I take you home?

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.835
Somewhere in the light.

01:01:20.545 --> 01:01:23.965
Promise you won't ask me again.
Please promise me that.

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:00.293
Why did you run?

01:02:00.751 --> 01:02:02.795
I'm responsible for you now.

01:02:03.422 --> 01:02:06.215
The Chinese say
that once you've saved a person's life...

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.552
...you're responsible for it forever,
so I'm committed.

01:02:09.885 --> 01:02:11.387
I have to know.

01:02:12.556 --> 01:02:14.766
There's so little that I know.

01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:23.358
It's as though I were walking
down a long corridor...

01:02:25.318 --> 01:02:29.697
...that once was mirrored, and fragments
of that mirror still hang there...

01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:33.409
...and when I come to the end
of the corridor...

01:02:33.702 --> 01:02:35.871
...there's nothing but darkness.

01:02:37.581 --> 01:02:40.375
And I know that
when I walk into the darkness...

01:02:42.878 --> 01:02:44.338
...that I'll die.

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:50.217
I've never come to the end.
I've always come back before then.

01:02:51.552 --> 01:02:53.472
- Except once.
- Yesterday?

01:02:54.472 --> 01:02:58.351
And you didn't know what happened
till you found yourself with me.

01:02:58.601 --> 01:03:00.268
You didn't know where you were.

01:03:00.393 --> 01:03:04.106
But the small scenes, the fragments
of the mirror, you remember those.

01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:06.150
- Vaguely.
- What do you remember?

01:03:06.275 --> 01:03:08.195
There's a room...

01:03:08.987 --> 01:03:10.822
...and I sit there alone.

01:03:11.114 --> 01:03:13.199
- Always alone.
- What else?

01:03:14.284 --> 01:03:16.119
- A grave.
- Where?

01:03:16.911 --> 01:03:19.873
I don't know. It's an open grave and...

01:03:21.375 --> 01:03:24.378
...I stand by the gravestone
looking down into it.

01:03:25.045 --> 01:03:27.088
- It's my grave.
- How do you know?

01:03:27.213 --> 01:03:30.884
- I know.
- But is there a name on the gravestone?

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.719
No.

01:03:33.637 --> 01:03:37.014
No, it's new and clean and waiting.

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:40.143
What else?

01:03:40.851 --> 01:03:42.938
This part is a dream, I think.

01:03:44.898 --> 01:03:49.193
There's a tower and a bell,
and a garden below.

01:03:50.195 --> 01:03:52.197
It seems to be in Spain...

01:03:52.905 --> 01:03:54.614
...a village in Spain.

01:03:55.449 --> 01:03:57.536
It clicks off and it's gone.

01:03:57.661 --> 01:03:59.496
Well, a portrait?

01:04:00.163 --> 01:04:02.206
- Do you see a portrait?
- No.

01:04:02.416 --> 01:04:05.335
If I could just find the key, the beginning...

01:04:05.668 --> 01:04:07.378
...and put it together, I...

01:04:07.503 --> 01:04:09.338
And so explain it away?

01:04:10.797 --> 01:04:13.342
There is a way to explain it, you see.

01:04:14.677 --> 01:04:17.972
If I'm mad, then that would explain it,
wouldn't it?

01:04:20.599 --> 01:04:21.893
Madeleine!

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.648
Scottie!

01:04:28.442 --> 01:04:31.652
I'm not mad! I'm not mad!
I don't want to die.

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:35.739
There's someone within me,
and she says I must die.

01:04:35.864 --> 01:04:37.826
Scottie, don't let me go.

01:04:38.367 --> 01:04:40.871
I'm here. I've got you.

01:04:41.788 --> 01:04:43.248
I'm so afraid.

01:04:53.507 --> 01:04:54.967
Don't leave me.

01:04:55.677 --> 01:04:57.762
- Stay with me.
- All the time.

01:05:24.949 --> 01:05:26.492
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi.

01:05:27.869 --> 01:05:30.538
- Did you get my message?
- I did, indeed.

01:05:31.664 --> 01:05:33.416
I'll get you a drink.

01:05:33.666 --> 01:05:34.708
Okay.

01:05:35.168 --> 01:05:38.753
Since when do you go around
slipping notes under men's doors?

01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:41.715
Since I stopped being able to get them
on the phone.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.510
For a man who has nothing to do,
you're certainly a busy little bee.

01:05:45.635 --> 01:05:47.429
Where do you go these days?

01:05:47.972 --> 01:05:49.222
Just wandering.

01:05:50.891 --> 01:05:52.851
- Where?
- Round about.

01:05:58.565 --> 01:06:00.943
What was this desperate urge to see me?

01:06:01.152 --> 01:06:04.030
All I said in my note was:
"Where are you?"

01:06:04.237 --> 01:06:06.699
Doesn't sound very desperate to me.

01:06:06.949 --> 01:06:09.327
I detected a little undercurrent.

01:06:10.661 --> 01:06:14.414
I just thought that if I gave you a drink
and fed you some dinner...

01:06:14.539 --> 01:06:17.043
...you'd be so grateful
you'd take me to a movie.

01:06:17.168 --> 01:06:20.505
That's fair enough.
What'll we talk about at dinner?

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.632
This and that.

01:06:24.425 --> 01:06:26.219
What I've been doing?

01:06:26.885 --> 01:06:28.387
If you want to.

01:06:28.554 --> 01:06:31.264
We won't talk about anything
you don't want to.

01:06:31.516 --> 01:06:32.809
Naturally.

01:06:35.893 --> 01:06:37.855
What have you been doing?

01:06:39.148 --> 01:06:40.273
Wandering.

01:06:42.985 --> 01:06:45.737
What have you been doing?
Thank you, dear.

01:06:46.197 --> 01:06:48.324
I've been having a wonderful time.

01:06:48.489 --> 01:06:52.119
- I've gone back to my first love: painting.
- Good for you.

01:06:52.369 --> 01:06:55.748
I always said you were wasting your time
in the underwear department.

01:06:55.873 --> 01:06:59.251
It's a living.
But I'm really excited about this.

01:06:59.501 --> 01:07:01.460
What is it? A still life?

01:07:01.963 --> 01:07:04.047
No, not exactly.

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:06.759
You want to see?

01:07:08.094 --> 01:07:10.471
I thought I might give it to you.

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.655
It's not funny, Midge.

01:07:30.992 --> 01:07:32.617
I just thought...

01:07:36.581 --> 01:07:38.958
Let's make that movie some other night.

01:07:52.637 --> 01:07:54.556
Marjorie Wood, you fool!

01:07:55.849 --> 01:07:56.974
Idiot!

01:08:05.943 --> 01:08:07.443
Stupid! Stupid!

01:08:47.193 --> 01:08:48.778
Madeleine! What's the matter?

01:08:48.903 --> 01:08:52.448
I should have phoned,
but I wanted to see you, be with you.

01:08:52.613 --> 01:08:55.283
- Why? What's happened?
- I had the dream.

01:08:55.451 --> 01:08:58.787
- The dream came back again.
- It's gonna be all right.

01:08:59.662 --> 01:09:02.625
It'll be all right. I'll get you some brandy.

01:09:03.251 --> 01:09:04.836
Drink this down.

01:09:05.502 --> 01:09:07.212
Just like medicine.

01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:10.381
There now.

01:09:10.925 --> 01:09:14.136
It was a dream. You're awake.
You're all right now.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.305
Now, can you tell me?

01:09:18.599 --> 01:09:22.435
It was the tower again,
and the bell and the old Spanish village.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.604
- Yes?
- Clear, so very clear for the first time.

01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:27.108
Tell me.

01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:30.569
It was a village square
and a green with trees...

01:09:30.694 --> 01:09:33.738
...and an old whitewashed
Spanish church with a cloister.

01:09:34.613 --> 01:09:37.326
Across the green,
there was a big, gray wooden house...

01:09:37.451 --> 01:09:40.412
...with a porch and a balcony
above a small garden...

01:09:40.537 --> 01:09:44.207
...and next to it a livery stable
with old carriages lined up inside.

01:09:44.332 --> 01:09:45.457
Go on.

01:09:45.667 --> 01:09:48.921
At the end of the green,
there was a whitewashed stone house...

01:09:49.046 --> 01:09:51.171
...with a lovely pepper tree at the corner.

01:09:51.296 --> 01:09:54.341
And an old wooden hotel
from the old California days?

01:09:54.635 --> 01:09:58.971
And a saloon? Dark, low ceilings,
with hanging oil lamps?

01:09:59.974 --> 01:10:02.185
- Yes.
- It's all there.

01:10:03.394 --> 01:10:04.685
It's no dream.

01:10:06.939 --> 01:10:09.649
You've been there before. You've seen it.

01:10:11.569 --> 01:10:12.528
No, never.

01:10:12.653 --> 01:10:16.448
A hundred miles south of San Francisco,
there's an old Spanish mission...

01:10:16.573 --> 01:10:19.408
...San Juan Bautista it's called
and it's been preserved...

01:10:19.533 --> 01:10:22.203
...exactly as it was 100 years ago
as a museum.

01:10:22.328 --> 01:10:24.916
Think hard, darling. Think hard.

01:10:25.875 --> 01:10:29.502
- You've been there before. You've seen it.
- I've never been there.

01:10:29.627 --> 01:10:32.046
- What is it? I've never been there.
- Think hard.

01:10:32.171 --> 01:10:34.759
Go on about your dream.
What frightened you?

01:10:35.216 --> 01:10:38.261
I stood alone on the green
searching for something...

01:10:39.011 --> 01:10:41.849
...and then I started to walk to the church...

01:10:43.059 --> 01:10:46.895
...but then the darkness closed in
and I was alone in the dark...

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:51.692
...being pulled into the darkness,
and I fought to wake up.

01:10:52.984 --> 01:10:55.319
You're going to be all right now.

01:10:55.613 --> 01:10:58.032
You've given me
something to work on now.

01:10:58.157 --> 01:11:00.408
I'll take you to that mission this afternoon.

01:11:00.533 --> 01:11:03.203
When you see it,
you'll remember when you saw it before.

01:11:03.328 --> 01:11:06.497
It'll finish your dream.
It'll destroy it, I promise you.

01:11:07.332 --> 01:11:08.626
All right?

01:11:10.795 --> 01:11:14.465
- Come on, now. I'll take you home.
- No. I'll be all right.

01:11:15.675 --> 01:11:17.676
You'll come back here around noon.

01:12:36.506 --> 01:12:39.966
Madeleine, where are you now?

01:12:42.136 --> 01:12:44.555
- Here with you.
- And it's all real!

01:12:45.014 --> 01:12:47.350
It's not merely as it was 100 years ago...

01:12:47.475 --> 01:12:51.813
...or a year ago or six months ago or
whenever it was you were here to see it.

01:12:51.938 --> 01:12:54.774
Now, Madeleine,
think of when you were here.

01:12:57.024 --> 01:12:59.612
There were not so many carriages then.

01:13:01.197 --> 01:13:03.573
There were horses in the stalls...

01:13:04.826 --> 01:13:06.953
...a bay, two black and a gray.

01:13:09.247 --> 01:13:11.332
It was our favorite place...

01:13:13.207 --> 01:13:15.586
...but we were forbidden to play here.

01:13:15.711 --> 01:13:19.171
And Sister Teresa would scold us.

01:13:23.469 --> 01:13:26.264
Look at this. Here's your gray horse.

01:13:28.474 --> 01:13:32.645
Have a little trouble getting in and out
of the stall without being pushed.

01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:35.564
You see? There's an answer
for everything.

01:13:40.069 --> 01:13:42.488
Madeleine, try.

01:13:47.993 --> 01:13:49.328
Try for me.

01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:12.643
- I love you, Madeleine.
- I love you, too.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.770
- Too late. Too late.
- No. We're together.

01:14:15.979 --> 01:14:18.774
No, it's too late.
There's something I must do.

01:14:18.939 --> 01:14:21.234
No. There's nothing you must do.

01:14:21.903 --> 01:14:24.029
There's nothing you must do.

01:14:26.282 --> 01:14:29.033
No one possesses you.
You're safe with me.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:37.376
No. It's too late.

01:14:50.014 --> 01:14:53.935
It's not fair. It's too late.
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:56.729
It had to happen. We're in love.
That's what counts.

01:14:56.813 --> 01:14:59.104
- Please let me go!
- Listen to me.

01:15:05.613 --> 01:15:07.782
- You believe I love you?
- Yes.

01:15:09.742 --> 01:15:11.911
And if you lose me, then you'll know...

01:15:12.036 --> 01:15:14.703
...I loved you and wanted
to go on loving you.

01:15:14.956 --> 01:15:16.372
I won't lose you.

01:15:19.042 --> 01:15:21.921
- Let me go into the church, alone.
- But why?

01:15:44.277 --> 01:15:45.359
Madeleine!

01:18:09.255 --> 01:18:14.341
Mr. Elster, suspecting all was not well
with his wife's mental state...

01:18:15.344 --> 01:18:19.640
...took the preliminary precaution
of having her watched by Mr. Ferguson...

01:18:19.849 --> 01:18:21.725
...lest any harm befall her.

01:18:22.059 --> 01:18:24.435
And you've heard
that Mr. Elster was prepared...

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.023
...to take his wife to an institution...

01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:31.609
...where her mental health would've been
in the hands of qualified specialists.

01:18:32.444 --> 01:18:35.948
Mr. Ferguson, being an ex-detective,
would have seemed...

01:18:36.113 --> 01:18:39.533
...the proper choice for the role
of watchdog and protector.

01:18:39.952 --> 01:18:42.828
As you have learned,
it was an unfortunate choice.

01:18:42.953 --> 01:18:46.751
However, I think you'll agree that no blame
can be attached to the husband.

01:18:46.876 --> 01:18:49.420
His delay in putting his wife
under medical care...

01:18:49.545 --> 01:18:53.297
...was due only to the need
for information as to her behavior...

01:18:53.466 --> 01:18:56.010
...which he expected to get
from Mr. Ferguson.

01:18:56.135 --> 01:18:58.805
He had taken every precaution
to protect his wife.

01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:01.931
He could not have anticipated
that Mr. Ferguson's weakness...

01:19:02.056 --> 01:19:03.768
...his fear of heights...

01:19:04.018 --> 01:19:06.813
...would make him powerless
when he was most needed.

01:19:06.938 --> 01:19:08.689
As to Mr. Ferguson...

01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:12.109
...you have heard his former superior...

01:19:12.359 --> 01:19:16.029
...Detective Captain Hansen,
from that great city to the north...

01:19:16.154 --> 01:19:18.908
...testify as to his character and ability.

01:19:19.198 --> 01:19:21.577
Captain Hansen was most enthusiastic.

01:19:21.868 --> 01:19:24.872
The fact that once before,
under similar circumstances...

01:19:24.997 --> 01:19:29.377
...Mr. Ferguson allowed a police colleague
to fall to his death...

01:19:29.502 --> 01:19:32.880
...Captain Hansen dismissed
as an "unfortunate incident. "

01:19:34.922 --> 01:19:37.385
Of course, Mr. Ferguson
is to be congratulated...

01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:40.054
...on having once saved the woman's life...

01:19:40.386 --> 01:19:44.640
...when, in a previous fit of aberration,
she threw herself into the Bay.

01:19:45.434 --> 01:19:48.938
It is a pity that,
knowing her suicidal tendencies...

01:19:49.854 --> 01:19:52.859
...he did not make a greater effort
the second time.

01:19:55.653 --> 01:19:59.782
But we are not here to pass judgment
on Mr. Ferguson's lack of initiative.

01:19:59.989 --> 01:20:01.576
He did nothing...

01:20:01.868 --> 01:20:05.621
...and the law has little to say
on the subject of things left undone.

01:20:05.746 --> 01:20:10.877
Nor does his strange behavior
after he saw the body fall...

01:20:11.877 --> 01:20:14.212
...have any bearing on your verdict.

01:20:15.046 --> 01:20:18.466
He did not remain at the scene
of the death. He left.

01:20:19.216 --> 01:20:22.761
He claims he suffered a mental blackout
and knew nothing more...

01:20:22.889 --> 01:20:27.560
...until he found himself back in his own
apartment in San Francisco hours later.

01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:30.188
You may accept that, or not.

01:20:32.023 --> 01:20:35.984
Or you may believe that, having once again
allowed someone to die...

01:20:36.734 --> 01:20:40.113
...he could not face the tragic result
of his own weakness...

01:20:40.238 --> 01:20:41.698
...and ran away.

01:20:44.118 --> 01:20:46.871
That has nothing to do with your verdict.

01:20:47.371 --> 01:20:50.541
It is a matter between him
and his own conscience.

01:20:52.585 --> 01:20:57.131
From the evidence of the state of mind
of Madeleine Elster prior to her death...

01:20:57.256 --> 01:21:01.091
...from the manner of her death and
the postmortem examination of the body...

01:21:01.219 --> 01:21:03.220
...showing the actual cause of her death...

01:21:03.345 --> 01:21:06.180
...you should have no difficulty
in reaching your verdict.

01:21:06.305 --> 01:21:08.725
Gentlemen, you may retire if you wish.

01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:13.439
Hold it, Mr. Jones.

01:21:35.377 --> 01:21:37.880
- We've reached a verdict.
- Thank you.

01:21:41.341 --> 01:21:44.426
"The jury finds that Madeleine Elster
committed suicide...

01:21:44.554 --> 01:21:46.470
"... while of unsound mind. "

01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:50.268
Your verdict will be so recorded.
Dismissed.

01:21:56.564 --> 01:21:59.484
- Scottie, let's go.
- Mind if I speak to him for a minute?

01:21:59.609 --> 01:22:00.819
Go ahead.

01:22:07.493 --> 01:22:09.743
Sorry, Scottie. That was rough.

01:22:10.162 --> 01:22:12.622
He had no right to speak to you like that.

01:22:12.747 --> 01:22:16.460
It was my responsibility.
I shouldn't have got you involved.

01:22:16.792 --> 01:22:19.630
No, there's nothing you have to say to me.

01:22:20.006 --> 01:22:22.466
I'm getting out, Scottie, for good.

01:22:22.631 --> 01:22:24.260
I can't stay here.

01:22:24.801 --> 01:22:27.720
I'm going to wind up her affairs,
and mine...

01:22:28.264 --> 01:22:30.224
...get away as far as I can.

01:22:31.015 --> 01:22:32.600
Europe, perhaps.

01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:35.854
And I probably never will come back.

01:22:36.854 --> 01:22:38.483
Good-bye, Scottie.

01:22:40.109 --> 01:22:43.237
If there's anything I can do for you
before I go...

01:22:44.988 --> 01:22:47.323
There's no way for them to understand.

01:22:48.576 --> 01:22:51.078
You and I know who killed Madeleine.

01:22:58.836 --> 01:23:00.921
Come on, Scottie. Let's get out of here.

01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:12.636
It's Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus.

01:25:14.305 --> 01:25:17.390
I had a long talk with that lady
in Musical Therapy...

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.144
...and she says
that Mozart's the boy for you...

01:25:20.269 --> 01:25:22.854
...the broom that sweeps
the cobwebs away.

01:25:25.399 --> 01:25:27.318
It's what the lady said.

01:25:30.738 --> 01:25:33.823
It's wonderful how
they have it all taped now, John.

01:25:33.948 --> 01:25:38.328
They have music for dipsomaniacs,
and music for melancholiacs...

01:25:38.496 --> 01:25:40.663
...and music for hypochondriacs.

01:25:41.872 --> 01:25:45.292
I wonder what would happen
if somebody got their files mixed up.

01:25:55.805 --> 01:25:59.350
I brought a lot of other things,
and you can see what you like.

01:25:59.725 --> 01:26:01.769
It shuts off automatically.

01:26:10.234 --> 01:26:11.944
Johnny, please try.

01:26:12.529 --> 01:26:13.904
Try, Johnny.

01:26:14.407 --> 01:26:17.118
You're not lost. Mother is here.

01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:22.872
Time?

01:26:26.836 --> 01:26:28.671
I'll be in again, John.

01:26:29.421 --> 01:26:31.591
You want me to shut that off?

01:26:54.572 --> 01:26:57.114
You don't even know I'm here, do you?

01:27:00.912 --> 01:27:02.328
But I'm here.

01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:19.514
Nurse, could I see the doctor
for a moment?

01:27:20.721 --> 01:27:22.350
Doctor, Miss Wood.

01:27:24.185 --> 01:27:26.145
Won't you go in, please?

01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.523
Yes, Miss Wood?

01:27:28.939 --> 01:27:32.819
Doctor, how long is it going to take you
to pull him out of this?

01:27:33.069 --> 01:27:36.197
It's hard to say. At least six months.
Perhaps a year.

01:27:36.738 --> 01:27:38.323
It really could depend on him.

01:27:38.448 --> 01:27:40.493
- He won't talk.
- No.

01:27:41.243 --> 01:27:43.828
He's suffering from acute melancholia...

01:27:43.953 --> 01:27:45.872
...together with a guilt complex.

01:27:45.997 --> 01:27:48.417
He blames himself
for what happened to the woman.

01:27:48.542 --> 01:27:51.127
We know little of what went on before.

01:27:51.796 --> 01:27:54.966
I can give you one thing:
He was in love with her.

01:27:56.006 --> 01:27:58.594
That does complicate the problem,
doesn't it?

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:02.346
I can give you another complication:
He still is.

01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:05.015
And you want to know something?

01:28:05.143 --> 01:28:08.060
I don't think Mozart's going to help at all.

01:29:38.359 --> 01:29:41.238
- Where'd you get this car?
- I beg your pardon?

01:29:41.823 --> 01:29:44.658
I bought it from a man who used to live
in this building.

01:29:44.783 --> 01:29:48.037
Mr. Gavin Elster.
I bought it from him when he moved away.

01:29:48.996 --> 01:29:50.997
You knew him and his wife!

01:29:51.332 --> 01:29:53.167
The poor thing. I didn't know her.

01:29:53.292 --> 01:29:56.420
- Is it true that she really-
- I'm sorry.

01:30:18.274 --> 01:30:20.359
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:30:46.554 --> 01:30:48.264
Give me a scotch and soda.

01:33:27.506 --> 01:33:31.135
- What is it?
- Could I ask you a couple of questions?

01:33:31.469 --> 01:33:34.430
- What for? Who are you?
- My name is John Ferguson.

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.765
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll?

01:33:37.725 --> 01:33:40.603
- There are some things I'd like to ask.
- You live in this hotel?

01:33:40.728 --> 01:33:43.314
No. I happened to see you
when you came in, so I-

01:33:43.439 --> 01:33:45.399
Yeah, I thought so. A pickup.

01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:49.362
You've got a nerve, following me
into the hotel and up to my room.

01:33:49.737 --> 01:33:53.198
- Now, you beat it.
- Please. I just want to talk to you.

01:33:53.573 --> 01:33:55.201
I'm gonna yell in a minute.

01:33:55.326 --> 01:33:58.118
I'm not gonna hurt you. Honest.
I promise.

01:33:58.662 --> 01:34:01.247
Please. Just let me talk to you.

01:34:02.166 --> 01:34:03.792
- What about?
- You.

01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:06.921
- Why?
- Because you remind me of somebody.

01:34:08.631 --> 01:34:10.506
I heard that one before, too.

01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:13.970
I remind you of someone
you were madly in love with...

01:34:14.051 --> 01:34:16.139
...but then she ditched you
for another guy...

01:34:16.264 --> 01:34:18.975
...and you've been carrying a torch
ever since.

01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:21.725
Then you saw me and something clicked.

01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:24.895
You're not far wrong.

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:28.359
- It's not gonna work, so go.
- Please, let me come in.

01:34:29.569 --> 01:34:33.823
You can leave the door open.
I just want to talk to you. Please.

01:34:36.576 --> 01:34:39.243
Well, I warn you, I can yell awful loud.

01:34:39.493 --> 01:34:41.122
You won't have to.

01:34:42.413 --> 01:34:47.837
You don't look much like Jack the Ripper.
What do you want to know?

01:34:48.171 --> 01:34:50.131
- I want to know your name.
- Judy Barton.

01:34:50.256 --> 01:34:52.675
- Who you are.
- I'm just a girl. I work at Magnin's.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:56.804
- How do you happen to be living here?
- It's a place to live, that's all.

01:34:57.011 --> 01:35:00.055
- But you haven't lived here long?
- Yeah, about three years.

01:35:00.181 --> 01:35:02.850
- Where did you live before?
- Salina, Kansas!

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.979
Listen, what is this? What do you want?

01:35:07.648 --> 01:35:10.734
- I just want to know who you are.
- Well, I told you.

01:35:12.904 --> 01:35:15.907
My name is Judy Barton.
I come from Salina, Kansas.

01:35:16.157 --> 01:35:18.283
I work at Magnin's and I live here.

01:35:20.703 --> 01:35:22.747
My gosh, do I have to prove it?

01:35:28.461 --> 01:35:31.421
All right, mister,
my Kansas driver's license.

01:35:32.087 --> 01:35:35.384
"Judy Barton, number Z296794.

01:35:35.551 --> 01:35:38.679
"425 Maple Avenue, Salina, Kansas. "

01:35:42.306 --> 01:35:45.810
See the address on this one?
It's this place right here.

01:35:46.395 --> 01:35:50.233
A California license issued May 25, 1954.

01:35:52.068 --> 01:35:55.112
You want to check my thumbprints?
You satisfied?

01:35:56.904 --> 01:36:00.326
Whether you're satisfied or not,
you can just beat it.

01:36:04.747 --> 01:36:07.332
You have got it bad, haven't you?

01:36:10.127 --> 01:36:12.130
Do I really look like her?

01:36:17.176 --> 01:36:19.261
She's dead, isn't she?

01:36:23.975 --> 01:36:27.103
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry I yelled at you.

01:36:34.402 --> 01:36:36.612
Yes, that's me with my mother.

01:36:38.197 --> 01:36:39.738
And that's my father.

01:36:40.783 --> 01:36:44.368
He's dead. My mother married again,
but I didn't like the guy...

01:36:44.493 --> 01:36:47.997
...so I decided I'd see what it's like
in sunny California.

01:36:49.125 --> 01:36:51.167
I've been here three years.

01:36:51.792 --> 01:36:52.962
Honest.

01:37:02.970 --> 01:37:05.475
- Will you have dinner with me?
- Why?

01:37:06.265 --> 01:37:10.060
- I feel I owe you something after all this.
- You don't owe me anything.

01:37:10.188 --> 01:37:13.149
- Then will you? For me?
- Dinner and what else?

01:37:13.733 --> 01:37:17.487
- Just dinner.
- 'Cause I remind you of her?

01:37:17.904 --> 01:37:20.404
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.

01:37:25.161 --> 01:37:27.203
I've been on blind dates before.

01:37:27.537 --> 01:37:30.791
Matter of fact, to be honest,
I've been picked up before.

01:37:32.585 --> 01:37:33.461
Okay.

01:37:33.795 --> 01:37:36.462
I'll get my car. I'll be back in half an hour.

01:37:36.587 --> 01:37:39.801
- Give me time to change and get fixed up.
- An hour?

01:37:41.426 --> 01:37:42.426
Okay.

01:39:37.167 --> 01:39:38.711
Dearest Scottie:

01:39:39.545 --> 01:39:41.255
And so you found me.

01:39:41.756 --> 01:39:44.425
This is the moment
that I dreaded and hoped for...

01:39:44.509 --> 01:39:47.970
...wondering what I would say and do
if I ever saw you again.

01:39:48.429 --> 01:39:51.096
I wanted so to see you again, just once.

01:39:51.474 --> 01:39:54.143
Now I'll go,
and you can give up your search.

01:39:54.519 --> 01:39:58.814
I want you to have peace of mind.
You've nothing to blame yourself for.

01:39:58.979 --> 01:40:00.483
You were the victim.

01:40:00.608 --> 01:40:05.194
I was the tool and you the victim
of Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife.

01:40:05.569 --> 01:40:10.033
He chose me to play the part because
I looked like her. He dressed me like her.

01:40:10.283 --> 01:40:14.328
He was quite safe because she lived
in the country and rarely came to town.

01:40:14.453 --> 01:40:17.291
He chose you to be the witness
to a suicide.

01:40:18.251 --> 01:40:20.920
The Carlotta story was part real,
part invented...

01:40:21.045 --> 01:40:24.506
...to make you testify
that Madeleine wanted to kill herself.

01:40:25.172 --> 01:40:29.470
He knew of your illness. He knew
you'd never get up the stairs to the tower.

01:40:29.845 --> 01:40:32.640
He planned it so well.
He made no mistakes.

01:40:34.015 --> 01:40:36.475
I made the mistake. I fell in love.

01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:39.229
That wasn't part of the plan.

01:40:40.148 --> 01:40:43.734
I'm still in love with you,
and I want you so to love me.

01:40:44.527 --> 01:40:46.737
If I had the nerve, I'd stay and lie...

01:40:46.863 --> 01:40:49.282
...hoping that I could
make you love me again...

01:40:49.407 --> 01:40:51.198
...as I am, for myself...

01:40:52.451 --> 01:40:55.953
...and so forget the other
and forget the past. But...

01:40:57.663 --> 01:41:00.626
...I don't know whether
I have the nerve to try.

01:43:17.136 --> 01:43:18.805
Here. I'll do it.

01:43:20.681 --> 01:43:23.728
- There you are.
- Thanks again. Good night.

01:43:23.895 --> 01:43:25.729
Can I see you tomorrow?

01:43:26.479 --> 01:43:29.899
- Tomorrow night? Well-
- No, I mean tomorrow morning.

01:43:32.904 --> 01:43:35.198
But I have to go to work. I've got a job.

01:43:35.323 --> 01:43:39.283
- Don't go to your job.
- What'll I live on? My oil wells in Texas?

01:43:39.658 --> 01:43:41.828
Let me take care of you, Judy.

01:43:43.747 --> 01:43:46.082
Thanks very much, but no, thanks.

01:43:47.417 --> 01:43:50.712
- No, Judy, you don't understand.
- I understand, all right.

01:43:50.962 --> 01:43:53.547
I've been understanding since I was 17.

01:43:54.341 --> 01:43:56.091
- And the next step is?
- No.

01:43:56.926 --> 01:43:58.970
No? Then what?

01:43:59.470 --> 01:44:01.055
We could just...

01:44:01.599 --> 01:44:03.600
...see a lot of each other...

01:44:04.435 --> 01:44:05.435
Why?

01:44:06.813 --> 01:44:08.729
'Cause I remind you of her?

01:44:14.278 --> 01:44:16.363
It's not very complimentary.

01:44:18.239 --> 01:44:19.742
And nothing else?

01:44:21.911 --> 01:44:22.868
No.

01:44:23.287 --> 01:44:25.663
That's not very complimentary either.

01:44:25.788 --> 01:44:28.626
I just want to be with you
as much as I can.

01:44:41.514 --> 01:44:42.680
Well...

01:44:43.724 --> 01:44:47.395
...I guess I could phone the store
in the morning...

01:44:49.395 --> 01:44:51.314
...and make some excuse.

01:45:57.965 --> 01:45:59.425
There you are.

01:46:01.176 --> 01:46:02.761
I like that one.

01:46:03.179 --> 01:46:04.764
- Like that?
- Yes.

01:46:05.515 --> 01:46:07.890
- That's very nice.
- It's beautiful.

01:46:09.810 --> 01:46:11.229
There we are.

01:46:11.354 --> 01:46:14.273
We'll get this,
then we'll buy you those clothes.

01:46:14.398 --> 01:46:16.524
- Honest?
- Right over there's Ransohoffs.

01:46:16.649 --> 01:46:19.694
- Nothing but the best. How much?
- That'll be 50 cents.

01:46:19.819 --> 01:46:21.738
- Thank you.
- You don't have to.

01:46:21.863 --> 01:46:23.157
I want to.

01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:49.934
- No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
- But you said gray, sir.

01:46:50.225 --> 01:46:53.020
I just want an ordinary, simple gray suit.

01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:56.774
- But I like that one, Scottie.
- No, it's not right.

01:46:57.774 --> 01:47:00.569
The gentleman seems to know
what he wants.

01:47:01.404 --> 01:47:03.363
All right. We'll find it.

01:47:10.912 --> 01:47:13.875
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to buy you a suit.

01:47:15.167 --> 01:47:17.627
But I love the second one she wore.

01:47:18.421 --> 01:47:22.091
- And this one, it's beautiful.
- They're none of them right.

01:47:22.631 --> 01:47:26.011
I think I know the suit you mean.
We had it some time ago.

01:47:26.136 --> 01:47:28.430
Let me see. We may still have that model.

01:47:28.555 --> 01:47:29.849
Thank you.

01:47:32.059 --> 01:47:34.770
You're looking for the suit
that she wore, for me.

01:47:34.895 --> 01:47:38.024
- You want me to dress like her.
- I just want you to look nice.

01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:41.694
- I know what suit would look well on you.
- No, I won't do it!

01:47:45.363 --> 01:47:46.238
Judy.

01:47:47.867 --> 01:47:50.536
It can't make a difference to you.
I just want to see-

01:47:50.661 --> 01:47:53.831
I don't want any clothes.
I want to get out of here.

01:47:53.997 --> 01:47:56.375
- Do this for me.
- Here we are.

01:47:57.417 --> 01:47:59.377
- Yes, that's it.
- I thought so.

01:48:00.212 --> 01:48:02.465
- I don't like it.
- We'll take it.

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:04.050
Will the thing fit?

01:48:04.175 --> 01:48:07.636
It might need some slight alterations,
but it's madam's size.

01:48:08.679 --> 01:48:11.265
We'll have it for you to try on in a moment.

01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:14.350
- How long will the alterations take?
- Well...

01:48:14.475 --> 01:48:17.814
- May we have it by tonight?
- If it's absolutely necessary.

01:48:17.979 --> 01:48:21.359
Yes, it is. Now, we'd like to look
at a dinner dress...

01:48:21.524 --> 01:48:25.654
...short, black, with long sleeves
and a kind of square neck.

01:48:25.779 --> 01:48:27.782
- Scottie!
- My!

01:48:28.658 --> 01:48:32.286
You certainly do know what you want, sir.
I'll see what we have.

01:48:40.627 --> 01:48:43.712
- That's it. Do you have them in brown?
- Yes, we have.

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:44.881
Fine.

01:48:53.055 --> 01:48:56.600
Here, Judy. Drink this straight down,
just like medicine.

01:48:57.478 --> 01:49:00.939
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?

01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:02.608
I don't know.

01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:05.359
No good, I guess. I don't know.

01:49:09.157 --> 01:49:12.201
I wish you'd leave me alone.
I want to go away.

01:49:13.618 --> 01:49:15.246
You can, you know.

01:49:17.582 --> 01:49:19.582
No. You wouldn't let me.

01:49:22.086 --> 01:49:24.796
And I don't want to go.

01:49:25.965 --> 01:49:28.466
Judy, I tell you this.

01:49:28.676 --> 01:49:32.220
These past few days are
the first happy days I've had in a year.

01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:34.515
I know because...

01:49:35.806 --> 01:49:37.894
Because I remind you of her.

01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:41.898
And not even that very much.

01:49:42.273 --> 01:49:43.274
No.

01:49:44.192 --> 01:49:47.278
No, Judy. It's you, too.

01:49:48.112 --> 01:49:50.404
There's something in you that...

01:49:54.993 --> 01:49:57.953
- You don't even want to touch me.
- Yes, I do.

01:50:00.372 --> 01:50:03.667
Couldn't you like me,
just me, the way I am?

01:50:05.296 --> 01:50:08.925
When we first started out, it was so good.
We had fun.

01:50:11.426 --> 01:50:14.095
And then you started in on the clothes.

01:50:15.805 --> 01:50:18.518
I'll wear the darned clothes
if you want me to...

01:50:18.643 --> 01:50:21.685
...if you'll just like me.

01:50:27.609 --> 01:50:29.444
The color of your hair.

01:50:35.533 --> 01:50:38.121
Judy, please. It can't matter to you.

01:50:49.090 --> 01:50:51.551
If I let you change me, will that do it?

01:50:52.135 --> 01:50:54.220
If I do what you tell me...

01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:57.640
...will you love me?

01:50:57.890 --> 01:50:58.890
Yes.

01:51:00.725 --> 01:51:02.310
- Yes.
- All right.

01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:08.067
All right, then, I'll do it.
I don't care anymore about me.

01:51:17.368 --> 01:51:19.662
Come on. We'll sit by the fire.

01:51:40.515 --> 01:51:42.643
I'm afraid it's going to take several hours.

01:51:42.768 --> 01:51:46.854
The young lady thought you'd like to go
home. She'll join you when she's finished.

01:51:46.979 --> 01:51:50.318
No. Tell her I'll go to her hotel
and wait for her there.

01:51:51.027 --> 01:51:54.322
- You're sure about the color of the hair?
- Yes, it's an easy color.

01:51:54.447 --> 01:51:56.782
- All the rest of-
- Yes, we know what you want.

01:51:56.908 --> 01:51:58.201
Thank you.

01:53:42.305 --> 01:53:43.389
Well?

01:53:43.514 --> 01:53:47.143
It should be back from your face
and pinned at the neck. I told her that.

01:53:47.268 --> 01:53:48.269
I told you that.

01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:52.480
We tried it. It just didn't seem to suit me.

01:53:58.529 --> 01:53:59.988
Please, Judy.

01:57:05.756 --> 01:57:08.469
- Where shall we go for dinner?
- Anywhere you like.

01:57:08.594 --> 01:57:11.889
- Ernie's?
- You have a thing about Ernie's, don't you?

01:57:12.930 --> 01:57:14.934
After all, it's our place.

01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:20.689
Hello, my love. Like me?

01:57:23.024 --> 01:57:25.734
- Is that the best you can do?
- Come here.

01:57:26.112 --> 01:57:27.572
No. You'll muss me.

01:57:28.154 --> 01:57:30.489
That's what I had in mind. Come here.

01:57:31.242 --> 01:57:33.327
It's too late. I got my face on.

01:57:33.911 --> 01:57:35.412
I'm suddenly hungry.

01:57:36.328 --> 01:57:39.667
- Would you rather go somewhere else?
- No. Ernie's is fine.

01:57:42.962 --> 01:57:46.131
I'm gonna have one
of those big, beautiful steaks.

01:57:46.881 --> 01:57:49.926
Let me see. To start I think I'll...

01:57:51.845 --> 01:57:53.764
Help me with this, will you?

01:57:56.765 --> 01:57:58.060
I have it.

01:57:59.310 --> 01:58:02.189
- How do you work this thing?
- Can't you see?

01:58:03.355 --> 01:58:07.028
- Now, there you are.
- Thank you. I'm just about ready.

01:58:07.862 --> 01:58:10.198
All I've gotta do is find my lipstick.

01:58:10.863 --> 01:58:13.033
Where did I put it? I had it a minute ago.

01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:29.216
I wonder if it's here. Here it is.

01:58:31.344 --> 01:58:32.761
There, I'm ready.

01:58:35.389 --> 01:58:37.475
But first, muss me a little?

01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:43.814
Scottie, I do have you now, don't I?

01:58:46.899 --> 01:58:50.194
How would you like to go someplace
out of town for dinner?

01:58:50.904 --> 01:58:54.783
- Maybe we could drive down the peninsula.
- All right. If you'd like.

01:59:13.094 --> 01:59:14.886
We're going awfully far.

01:59:15.011 --> 01:59:18.224
I just feel like driving.
Are you terribly hungry?

01:59:19.181 --> 01:59:20.893
No, it's all right.

01:59:41.328 --> 01:59:43.038
Where are you going?

01:59:47.670 --> 01:59:49.921
One final thing I have to do...

01:59:52.506 --> 01:59:54.801
...and then I'll be free of the past.

02:00:14.822 --> 02:00:17.283
Scottie, why are we here?

02:00:17.698 --> 02:00:19.076
I told you.

02:00:21.453 --> 02:00:23.581
I have to go back into the past once more.

02:00:23.706 --> 02:00:27.126
Just once more, for the last time.

02:00:28.211 --> 02:00:29.670
Why? Why here?

02:00:30.462 --> 02:00:32.465
Madeleine died here, Judy.

02:00:34.591 --> 02:00:38.011
- I don't wanna go. I'd rather wait-
- No, I need you.

02:00:38.304 --> 02:00:39.305
Why?

02:00:40.346 --> 02:00:43.015
I need you to be Madeleine for a while.

02:00:43.810 --> 02:00:46.479
And when it's done, we'll both be free.

02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:50.608
- I'm scared.
- I have to tell you about Madeleine now.

02:00:51.734 --> 02:00:53.069
Right there.

02:00:54.319 --> 02:00:56.863
We stood there,
and I kissed her for the last time.

02:00:56.988 --> 02:00:59.783
She said, "If you lose me,
you'll know that I love you...

02:00:59.908 --> 02:01:01.661
"... and wanted to keep loving you. "

02:01:01.786 --> 02:01:05.037
And I said, "I won't lose you. " But I did.

02:01:06.666 --> 02:01:08.207
And then she turned...

02:01:10.127 --> 02:01:12.046
...and ran into the church.

02:01:25.059 --> 02:01:27.645
When I followed her, it was too late.

02:01:32.189 --> 02:01:33.899
I don't want to go in there!

02:01:34.024 --> 02:01:35.484
It was too late.

02:01:43.453 --> 02:01:47.206
I couldn't find her,
and then I heard footsteps on the stairs.

02:01:47.832 --> 02:01:49.832
She was running up the tower.

02:01:49.957 --> 02:01:51.292
Right here.

02:01:52.086 --> 02:01:54.380
See? She was running up the stairs...

02:01:54.712 --> 02:01:57.506
...and through the trapdoor
at the top of the tower.

02:01:57.631 --> 02:02:00.636
I tried to follow her,
but I couldn't get to the top.

02:02:00.801 --> 02:02:03.471
I tried, but I couldn't get to the top.

02:02:03.639 --> 02:02:05.890
One doesn't often get a second chance.

02:02:06.015 --> 02:02:08.185
I want to stop being haunted.

02:02:08.810 --> 02:02:12.398
You're my second chance, Judy.
You're my second chance.

02:02:12.523 --> 02:02:13.939
Take me away!

02:02:14.274 --> 02:02:17.904
You look like Madeleine now.
Go up the stairs.

02:02:18.029 --> 02:02:19.947
- No!
- Go up the stairs.

02:02:22.742 --> 02:02:24.702
Go up the stairs, Judy...

02:02:26.328 --> 02:02:27.872
...and I'll follow.

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:30.725
This was as far as I could get,
but you went on.

02:03:32.228 --> 02:03:33.435
Remember?

02:03:34.438 --> 02:03:37.483
The necklace, Madeleine.
That was the slip.

02:03:38.274 --> 02:03:40.109
I remembered the necklace.

02:03:40.234 --> 02:03:42.904
- Let me go!
- No. We're going up the tower, Madeleine.

02:03:42.988 --> 02:03:44.738
You can't! You're afraid!

02:03:45.533 --> 02:03:48.911
We'll see. We'll see.
This is my second chance.

02:03:49.036 --> 02:03:50.121
Please!

02:03:50.453 --> 02:03:53.122
You knew that day
that I couldn't follow you.

02:03:53.291 --> 02:03:56.127
- Who was up there? Elster and his wife?
- Yes.

02:03:56.252 --> 02:03:59.546
And she was the one who died.
The real wife, not you.

02:03:59.921 --> 02:04:02.300
You were the counterfeit, weren't you?

02:04:02.425 --> 02:04:05.261
- Was she dead or alive-
- Dead! He'd broken her neck.

02:04:05.386 --> 02:04:08.430
He'd broken her neck.
Wasn't taking any chances, was he?

02:04:08.555 --> 02:04:12.100
When you got up there, he pushed her off,
but it was you who screamed.

02:04:12.225 --> 02:04:16.314
- Why did you scream?
- I wanted to stop it. I ran up to stop it-

02:04:16.479 --> 02:04:20.774
Stop it? Why did you scream,
since you tricked me so well up to then?

02:04:21.068 --> 02:04:25.029
You played the wife very well, Judy.
He made you over, didn't he?

02:04:25.238 --> 02:04:28.533
He made you over just like
I made you over, only better.

02:04:28.658 --> 02:04:33.122
Not only the clothes and the hair,
but the looks, the manner and the words...

02:04:33.331 --> 02:04:35.207
...and those beautiful phony trances.

02:04:35.332 --> 02:04:37.376
And you jumped into the Bay, didn't you?

02:04:37.502 --> 02:04:40.296
I'll bet you're a wonderful swimmer,
aren't you?

02:04:40.421 --> 02:04:42.006
- Aren't you?
- Yes!

02:04:42.465 --> 02:04:46.844
Then what did he do? Did he train you?
Did he rehearse you?

02:04:47.136 --> 02:04:50.095
Did he tell you exactly what to do,
what to say?

02:04:50.221 --> 02:04:53.059
You were a very apt pupil, too,
weren't you?

02:04:54.519 --> 02:04:57.020
Why did you pick on me? Why me?

02:04:57.145 --> 02:04:58.604
Your accident!

02:04:59.104 --> 02:05:00.564
The accident!

02:05:01.317 --> 02:05:03.319
I was the setup, wasn't I?

02:05:03.444 --> 02:05:05.654
I was a made-to-order witness.

02:05:13.371 --> 02:05:14.662
I made it.

02:05:16.541 --> 02:05:19.210
- I made it.
- What are you going to do?

02:05:21.796 --> 02:05:24.631
We're going up and look
at the scene of the crime.

02:05:24.756 --> 02:05:26.216
Come on, Judy.

02:05:38.479 --> 02:05:40.439
This is where it happened.

02:05:42.692 --> 02:05:45.359
The two of you hid there
and waited for it to clear...

02:05:45.484 --> 02:05:48.904
...then you sneaked down
and drove into town, is that it?

02:05:49.157 --> 02:05:51.701
And then? You were his girl?

02:05:52.658 --> 02:05:54.412
What happened to you?

02:05:55.037 --> 02:05:56.787
Did he ditch you?

02:05:58.457 --> 02:06:00.251
With all of his wife's money...

02:06:00.376 --> 02:06:04.255
...and all that freedom and power,
and he ditched you. What a shame.

02:06:04.462 --> 02:06:07.131
But he knew he was safe.
He knew you couldn't talk.

02:06:07.256 --> 02:06:09.844
- Did he give you anything?
- Some money.

02:06:10.261 --> 02:06:13.139
And the necklace, Carlotta's necklace.

02:06:14.305 --> 02:06:16.850
There was where you made
your mistake, Judy.

02:06:16.975 --> 02:06:19.520
You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing.

02:06:24.192 --> 02:06:26.694
You shouldn't have been that sentimental.

02:06:30.738 --> 02:06:32.742
I loved you so, Madeleine.

02:06:37.121 --> 02:06:38.956
I was safe when you found me.

02:06:39.081 --> 02:06:41.167
There was nothing that you could prove.

02:06:41.292 --> 02:06:45.127
But when I saw you again,
I couldn't run away. I loved you so.

02:06:45.921 --> 02:06:48.006
I walked into danger
and let you change me...

02:06:48.131 --> 02:06:50.466
...because I loved you and I wanted you.

02:06:53.261 --> 02:06:55.471
Scottie, please. You loved me.

02:06:56.224 --> 02:06:58.893
- Keep me safe. Please!
- It's too late.

02:06:59.018 --> 02:07:01.685
It's too late. There's no bringing her back.

02:07:01.854 --> 02:07:02.979
Please.

02:07:15.451 --> 02:07:16.953
I heard voices.

02:07:20.957 --> 02:07:22.457
God have mercy.
