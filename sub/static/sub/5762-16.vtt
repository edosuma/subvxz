(GASPS)

00:07.003 --> 00:10.184
Who are you? What do you want?

00:10.309 --> 00:12.402
Why didn't you tell me
your wife was dead?

00:12.527 --> 00:13.951
Because I don't deal with it very well.

00:15.081 --> 00:16.797
Will you forgive me?

00:16.922 --> 00:20.103
It's what she needs
to find peace and cross over.

00:20.269 --> 00:21.358
No.

00:21.483 --> 00:24.371
You tell him
he doesn't know what pain is!

00:24.455 --> 00:25.962
None of you do.

00:29.226 --> 00:32.573
PAYNE: Come on. But Dean Stokes,
in the spirit of publish or perish,

00:32.783 --> 00:37.219
out there is a scholarly journal
of arcane rituals and...

00:37.344 --> 00:40.651
And paranormal
and, admittedly, some shinola.

(GRUNTS)

00:42.366 --> 00:44.543
- Gosh, are you okay?
- Have you seen my glasses?

00:44.668 --> 00:46.804
I... Where are they?
'Cause without them...

00:46.929 --> 00:49.272
You're as blind as
the proverbial cavefish. Yeah.

00:49.397 --> 00:53.457
<i>Well, to show off, I was going to say

Same old Ricky.

00:59.526 --> 01:03.501
Nina. Oh, my gosh.
Nina, what are you doing here?

01:04.045 --> 01:06.933
You know, still just dealing drugs.

01:07.058 --> 01:08.984
Wow, well, that's good.
You're not kidding.

01:09.109 --> 01:11.997
No, no.
I'm a pharmaceutical rep, remember?

01:12.123 --> 01:13.127
- Right. Yes.
- Yeah.

01:13.252 --> 01:15.136
There's a conference here
in Grandview.

01:15.261 --> 01:17.187
Anyway, you... You teach here?

01:17.312 --> 01:20.493
Yeah! Yes, I've...
I've been teaching here for...

01:21.539 --> 01:23.840
Well, who needs numbers, right?

01:26.603 --> 01:31.039
I heard about your wife.
I was going to call or write.

01:31.709 --> 01:33.634
It just seemed weird.

01:33.759 --> 01:36.647
It's fine. I'm fine.
It's been three years. I'm fine.

01:36.731 --> 01:39.325
- Yeah. Well, it was great to see you.
- Yes.

01:39.452 --> 01:42.799
It... It just really... I'm going now.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.226
- Nina, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- What? Yeah.

01:45.352 --> 01:47.319
I mean, you're here. You're in town.

01:47.445 --> 01:51.337
Since you're in town, we should maybe
go get a bite to eat for old time's sake.

01:51.462 --> 01:52.467
- Old time's sake?
- Yes.

01:52.592 --> 01:55.145
Yeah, well,
that might be a little easier for you

01:55.312 --> 01:58.912
after the way things worked out,
or didn't.

01:59.037 --> 02:02.008
That was 10 years ago, right?

02:02.134 --> 02:03.934
Like you said, who needs numbers?

02:04.059 --> 02:06.151
Yeah. So, then it's a date.

02:06.278 --> 02:10.461
- As long as it's not like a date-date.
- Okay.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.723
MELINDA: Explain to me
the emergency dinner.

02:12.848 --> 02:14.982
PAYNE: Okay, her name is Nina
and we had a thing,

02:15.108 --> 02:16.573
a wild thing, about 10 years ago.

02:16.698 --> 02:18.790
And it was all just chemistry
and passion and damp sheets...

02:18.917 --> 02:21.678
- Without the mind pictures.
- Okay, sorry.

02:21.804 --> 02:24.231
We hit it off, obviously, because
we were both academicians and...

02:24.357 --> 02:26.533
Academicians.
Points for pretentiousness.

02:26.659 --> 02:28.793
Sorry, we were peers.
And everything was going great.

02:28.961 --> 02:31.890
And Nina and I had to break it off
because I was marrying Kate.

02:32.057 --> 02:34.986
Look, Nina is always going
to be the big "what if" in my life,

02:35.113 --> 02:37.581
always will be the road not taken.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.632
And because of an errant
basketball throw to my head,

02:39.758 --> 02:41.013
I may have a second chance
with this thing.

02:41.139 --> 02:43.022
Look, I've only...
I don't want to get girly here,

02:43.148 --> 02:46.370
but I've been in love twice in my life,
and only one of them is still around.

02:46.495 --> 02:48.756
And, granted,
she's a little Payne-shy right now,

02:48.839 --> 02:52.940
so I figure why not just loosen her up
with a good old-fashioned foursome?

02:53.066 --> 02:54.573
- What?
- A foursome?

02:54.698 --> 02:57.669
Dinner!
A foursome at dinner, you dirty birds.

03:02.022 --> 03:03.822
- PAYNE: Over here.
- Hi, guys.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.802
- Wow! You sure came in handy.
- Yeah.

03:08.928 --> 03:11.565
- Thank you.
- JIM: Let me help you up.

03:11.690 --> 03:15.791
- Hi. I'm Nina.
- Hey, Jim. Good to be handy.

03:15.959 --> 03:18.469
- Melinda, his wife.
- It's nice to meet you.

03:18.596 --> 03:19.809
MELINDA: Hi.

03:19.934 --> 03:23.533
- You okay?
- Yeah, just nerves, you know?

- Hi, Nina. Over here.
- Hi, Ricky.

putting on a dress?

NINA: Wow, you weren't kidding
about that...

03:44.166 --> 03:46.007
Did our foursome
just become a fivesome?

03:46.133 --> 03:48.058
His wife is here. Go away.

03:48.183 --> 03:52.285
But a dutiful wife's place
is at her husband's side, isn't it?

03:52.411 --> 03:55.256
Such typical Rick. You know,
he's only interested in two things,

03:55.382 --> 03:57.475
and they're both prominently
on display.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.027
Would you excuse us? Me! Me.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.714
PAYNE: Spilt salt. That's good luck.
NINA: Unless it's an open wound, right?

04:04.840 --> 04:05.844
Where have you been?

04:05.970 --> 04:08.857
Still tediously earthbound,
thanks to my husband.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.825
- You need to go into the light.
- What? And miss all the fun?

04:10.951 --> 04:13.294
MELINDA: You know what? I don't
have time to deal with you right now.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.423
KATE: So, ignore me.

04:14.591 --> 04:16.432
Yeah. You're making that
kind of difficult.

04:16.559 --> 04:20.324
Not half as difficult as I plan
to make things for those two.

04:20.450 --> 04:23.254
JIM: I'm a paramedic.
NINA: I love paramedics.

04:23.882 --> 04:25.138

05:05.356 --> 05:08.076
Hey. What happened to your hand?

05:08.202 --> 05:09.792
Oh, halfway through dinner last night,

05:09.918 --> 05:11.550
I realised I was still wearing
my wedding ring.

05:11.675 --> 05:14.437
And the silliest thing, I kept trying
to yank it off, and it wouldn't come off.

05:14.563 --> 05:17.242
My finger just kept getting
more and more swollen.

05:17.409 --> 05:20.129
- So, how was the rest of your date?
- Fantastic.

05:20.255 --> 05:23.226
Except for the fact
that you forgot to tell me, your friend,

05:23.352 --> 05:26.700
"Hey, Professor Payne, guess what?
Your super hot ex-girlfriend

05:26.867 --> 05:29.127
"has an evil, mischievous ghost
attached to her."

05:29.253 --> 05:33.270
She doesn't. You do.
It's Kate. Your wife.

05:34.735 --> 05:38.042
Okay. I guess
I should've seen that one coming.

05:38.167 --> 05:40.217
This is a very strange question.
How is Kate?

05:40.427 --> 05:42.059
Not so good.

05:42.185 --> 05:44.319
She's still earthbound
because you won't forgive her.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.663
And now that you're
obviously interested in Nina...

05:46.788 --> 05:47.793
Wait a minute. She's jealous?

05:47.918 --> 05:49.257
Is that what you're gonna tell me?
She's jealous.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.015
I'm not the one that had an affair
when she was alive.

05:51.140 --> 05:52.522
So why can't I go on a date now?

05:52.647 --> 05:54.614
Look, if you want things
to work out with Nina,

05:54.739 --> 05:56.665
you need to let me
help you talk to Kate.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.176
No. Kate knows that this relationship
might go somewhere.

05:59.301 --> 06:01.645
- That's why she's getting involved.
- She's stuck here, okay,

06:01.770 --> 06:04.114
because you won't help her cross over.
It isn't healthy.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.750
Healthy? She's dead.
What are you talking about, healthy?

06:06.877 --> 06:10.643
Look, do me a favour, Melinda.
This time, just stay out of it, okay?

06:10.810 --> 06:13.237
She could hurt you or Nina.

06:13.363 --> 06:17.297
More than she already has?
You know what? I'll take my chances.

06:24.496 --> 06:28.178
- Hi.
- Hi. Wow, good morning indeed.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.234
<i>You just missed a fascinating hour
on Megalithomania.</i>

06:31.359 --> 06:33.577
That's my favourite.

06:33.786 --> 06:36.464
Actually, could I talk to you
for a minute?

06:36.591 --> 06:38.808
Well, yeah, for you,
I have more than a minute.

06:38.976 --> 06:42.031
Wow, I don't know how
to say this except...

06:43.622 --> 06:45.672
Being with you last night

06:45.797 --> 06:50.694
reminded me of how much it hurt
when you dumped me.

06:51.071 --> 06:53.289
Oh, I... I prefer to say "broke up with."

06:53.414 --> 06:56.176
I can't get my heart
broken again, Ricky.

06:57.809 --> 06:59.901
- So, it was fun.
- Nina.

07:00.026 --> 07:03.751
Hey. You take care of yourself, okay?

07:04.755 --> 07:06.681
Nina, come on.

07:10.238 --> 07:11.829
Nina, come on.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.813
Are you happy now, darling?

07:19.696 --> 07:21.622
As if that's possible.

07:27.982 --> 07:32.126
- Honey, you want a glass of wine?
- No, thanks. It makes me sleepy.

07:32.921 --> 07:35.934
Melinda, you can't stay awake forever.

07:36.604 --> 07:39.283
And looking at these masks
is not doing you any good right now.

07:39.408 --> 07:42.588
I'm just trying to figure out
which mask the guy is wearing

07:42.715 --> 07:44.974
in one of my dreams or memories,
whatever they are.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.444
I know, but maybe
you should take a break.

07:47.569 --> 07:50.540
I don't know,
maybe help Kate cross over.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.600
- I'm staying away from that one.
- Really?

07:54.725 --> 07:56.902
Yeah. Payne doesn't want my help.

07:57.027 --> 07:59.454
He seems to think
this is his chance to get back at her,

07:59.622 --> 08:02.384
and she doesn't want
to go anywhere near a light, so...

08:02.510 --> 08:04.141
Yeah. I get it.

08:06.402 --> 08:09.415
Mel, I'm worried about you.
You hardly get any sleep these days.

08:09.541 --> 08:11.298
And when you do,
your nightmares are getting worse.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.470
The only way it's going to stop

08:12.595 --> 08:15.065
is if I can figure out
who this masked guy is

08:15.232 --> 08:17.324
and what he's trying to tell me.

08:17.451 --> 08:19.961
I'm pretty sure it has something to do
with my father.

08:20.087 --> 08:23.058
Well, do you think you should talk
to a professional?

08:23.184 --> 08:24.983
I don't need therapy.

08:25.946 --> 08:28.666
No, I mean, do you think you should
talk to a private investigator?

08:28.833 --> 08:31.804
Do you remember my cop friend,
Carl Neely?

08:31.972 --> 08:34.023
That's what he does. He moonlights.

08:34.106 --> 08:36.827
I mean, he could tell you
how your dad died,

08:36.953 --> 08:39.087
when, where he's buried even.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.852
Do you want me to call him?

08:43.607 --> 08:44.946
(ELEVATOR BELL CHIMING)

- Hi.

09:00.724 --> 09:02.021
(WHISPERING)
What are you doing here?

09:02.147 --> 09:06.248
I'm sorry about the hour, but it's just...
Can I come in?

09:07.713 --> 09:08.885
- No.
- No?

09:09.010 --> 09:10.307
- No.
- No.

09:12.233 --> 09:14.116
- I'll come out.
- Good.

09:14.242 --> 09:17.715
Look, I don't blame you.
I wouldn't really trust me, either.

09:17.841 --> 09:19.808
But you need to know this. I had...

09:19.933 --> 09:22.360
Well, I had my heart broken.
Twice, as a matter of fact.

09:22.486 --> 09:24.118
I mean, once when Kate died,

09:24.286 --> 09:26.043
and then another time,
after she was already dead,

09:26.169 --> 09:28.805
- I found out that she had an affair.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know...

09:28.931 --> 09:32.069
I'm much... I'm much more sensitive
to people's hearts

09:32.196 --> 09:35.836
since my heart has been ripped out
and kicked around like a hacky sack.

09:35.962 --> 09:38.138
And the fact of the matter is,
we really had a good time last night.

09:38.263 --> 09:39.268
Yeah, we did. I know, but...

09:39.393 --> 09:41.779
'Cause if you're in town for a week,
we should make a go of this thing.

09:41.905 --> 09:44.583
We can go have lunch. What's lunch?
Nobody ever got hurt by lunch,

09:44.708 --> 09:46.927
unless, of course,
there was a food-borne illness.

09:47.052 --> 09:49.187
Why are we whispering exactly?

09:49.354 --> 09:51.280
You're not alone in there, are you?

09:51.488 --> 09:52.660
- No.
- No.

09:53.330 --> 09:54.334
But it's not what you think.

09:54.459 --> 09:57.013
ELLIOT: Mom? Who you talking to?

09:57.139 --> 10:00.277
Just a friend, baby.
You go back to sleep, okay?

10:00.403 --> 10:01.533
Mom?

10:02.872 --> 10:07.391
I usually detonate that bomb
on the third or fourth date, but, yes,

10:08.899 --> 10:12.163
I have a son. His name is Elliot.

10:12.957 --> 10:17.393
And since I would have to bring him
to lunch tomorrow, you can flee now.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.654
No, no. I'm not fleeing.

10:19.822 --> 10:23.504
No. You...
You should bring him to lunch with us.

10:23.630 --> 10:26.685
I love kids.
What kind of a guy doesn't like kids?

10:27.146 --> 10:30.493
I hate kids.
Maybe "hate" is a strong word,

10:30.618 --> 10:33.925
but I have a profound lack
of understanding for the need to breed.

10:34.050 --> 10:37.105
Plus, all kids are just filled with snot.

10:37.231 --> 10:41.458
- So, it's a non-starter for you?
- I just think single moms are dicey.

10:42.085 --> 10:43.885
- None taken.
- What?

10:44.011 --> 10:46.355
I was just hoping
you'd throw a "no offence" my way.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.405
But guess I gave you too much credit.

10:48.530 --> 10:50.581
Oh, no, no, no, no.
But your son, Ned, he's different.

10:50.707 --> 10:53.093
He's a... He's a teen or a tween,
or whatever they're called.

10:53.260 --> 10:54.516
- Teen will do.
- He's a teen.

10:54.641 --> 10:57.194
And look, he's interacting,
cyclical conversation.

10:57.403 --> 10:58.826
He's fine. He's self-sufficient.

10:58.952 --> 11:00.751
Nina's son isn't going
to be self-sufficient.

11:00.876 --> 11:03.848
And he's going to be a complete
germ-bag, for crying out loud.

11:03.974 --> 11:06.526
Hey! You are a mom. You can help me.

11:06.694 --> 11:09.623
You can... You can watch this kid
while I go to lunch.

11:09.749 --> 11:14.813
Oh, sorry. But I am taking my son
on a dicey-single-mom lunch.

11:14.938 --> 11:16.403
Let's go, Ned.

11:17.114 --> 11:19.374
NED: So, what's the deal with that guy?
DELIA: You don't wanna know.

11:19.501 --> 11:20.672
- Don't even look at me.
- DELIA: Hey! Come on in.

11:20.798 --> 11:22.179
Thank you.

11:23.602 --> 11:24.857
NINA: Hi, guys.

11:26.364 --> 11:28.581
This is Elliot.

11:29.545 --> 11:31.386
EI, Professor Payne.

11:31.972 --> 11:34.692
- Hello, young man. How are you?
- Hello, Professor Payne.

11:34.818 --> 11:36.826
Please. Call me...

11:36.952 --> 11:38.500
Actually, call me Professor.
That's good.

11:38.626 --> 11:40.677
Hi, Elliot. I'm Melinda.

11:42.978 --> 11:45.992
Some people think dust
is mostly flakes from human skin.

11:46.117 --> 11:47.121
Elliot.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.172
Actually, dust is a lot of things.

11:49.298 --> 11:51.390
It could be pet dander, pollen,
it could be soot...

11:51.515 --> 11:54.152
Yeah, but its overall makeup
depends on where you live.

11:54.278 --> 11:58.253
I think the human skin thing
was started to help sell dust spray.

11:58.798 --> 12:00.389
Are you an academician?

12:00.514 --> 12:02.857
Spare me.
Nobody but Rick's that pretentious.

12:02.983 --> 12:05.033
As a matter of fact, I am.

12:05.870 --> 12:08.633
- Why would you ask me that?
- So is my dad.

12:08.758 --> 12:12.399
You see, his dad is not really
in the picture. He's...

12:12.525 --> 12:14.659
He's on an extended sabbatical
in India.

12:14.869 --> 12:17.715
They can't get text messages there.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.607
- Mind if I take a look at your Victrola?
- No. Go right ahead.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.875
Elliot? How old are you, exactly?

12:26.001 --> 12:28.638
ELLIOT: Almost 10, sir.
That's a decade.

12:28.763 --> 12:32.111
- When's your birthday?
- August 27th. I'm a Virgo.

12:32.237 --> 12:33.492
PAYNE: And we broke up in...

12:33.660 --> 12:36.380
- This isn't happening.
- Maybe it's not what it seems.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.472
Can I talk to you alone?

12:39.854 --> 12:43.745
I just remembered we've got a...
A thing we're going to be late for.

12:43.871 --> 12:46.843
EI? Baby, come on, we got to go.

12:46.968 --> 12:49.353
- Nice to meet you all.
- NINA: Bye, guys.

12:57.766 --> 12:59.942
There's no way
I'm that kid's father, right?

13:00.067 --> 13:03.289
Well, ignoring what she's already
told him about his dad,

13:03.415 --> 13:06.638
the fact that he seems
to have your DNA, the math...

13:06.763 --> 13:08.019
- You're not helping.
- You asked.

13:08.228 --> 13:10.781
- I know I asked.
- You could always take a paternity test.

13:10.906 --> 13:13.291
And confirm something
that I don't want to be true?

13:13.459 --> 13:14.631
She hasn't exactly demanded one,

13:14.756 --> 13:16.557
and it's my own darn fault
for chasing after her.

13:16.682 --> 13:18.816
I didn't want kids when I was married,
let alone now.

13:18.942 --> 13:21.286
Neither do I. Not yet, anyway.

13:22.708 --> 13:24.550
Why don't you want kids?
Do you mind me asking?

13:24.675 --> 13:28.191
I do mind, actually, but I will answer.
It's your porch.

13:28.317 --> 13:31.957
Kids are a huge responsibility
and I'm selfish. What's your excuse?

13:32.082 --> 13:35.054
I'm afraid of juggling, you know, the...

13:35.180 --> 13:38.737
The feeding and the diapers
while dead people harass me.

13:40.327 --> 13:41.667
You win.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.940
I can't be a dad. Look at me.
I'm not father material.

13:47.065 --> 13:48.614
I'm a miscreant of epic proportions!

13:48.739 --> 13:50.958
- Well, that's true.
- All right.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.924
Besides, we don't even know
if this is what Nina wants.

13:53.050 --> 13:56.440
- Who knows what Nina wants.
- There's one way to find out.

13:56.566 --> 13:59.202
You know what? I hate talking to you.

14:03.219 --> 14:05.605
- ELLIOT: I'll promote to a knight.
- Damn.

14:06.652 --> 14:12.218
I found out I was pregnant after
you left, and I was so scared, Ricky.

14:12.845 --> 14:16.989
And I was going to tell you,
but you were already with Kate.

14:17.114 --> 14:18.202
Happy.

14:19.500 --> 14:22.471
From the sounds of it,
you've all but told him I'm his dad.

14:22.555 --> 14:25.150
NINA: No. I just kind of, you know,
dressed it up a little.

14:25.275 --> 14:28.497
That way, if he ever does find out,
it won't be such a shock to him.

14:28.623 --> 14:30.758
Doesn't he have a right
to know who his father is?

14:30.883 --> 14:31.971
It's complicated.

14:32.096 --> 14:33.938
ELLIOT: Check.
ALEXANDER: What, again?

14:35.152 --> 14:36.282
ALEXANDER: Nice.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.374
He's mine?

14:38.500 --> 14:40.969
He's brilliant. He didn't get it from me.

14:41.094 --> 14:43.313
- Don't underestimate yourself.
- No.

14:43.438 --> 14:46.828
I... I tried to enrol him
at Archfield Academy.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.883
That's good. That's a good school
for pint-sized Mensas.

14:50.008 --> 14:51.222
Anyway, it's not going to happen.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.357
Wait a minute.
This kid could get into Yale.

14:53.482 --> 14:56.035
There's no way
he didn't get accepted there.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.332
He did.

14:57.458 --> 15:01.309
It's just they... They only have
two financial aid slots open.

15:02.313 --> 15:04.949
He seems to be doing okay
at public school.

15:05.074 --> 15:06.958
Public school? Nina, no, no.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.302
This kid's a genius.
You put him in public school,

15:09.511 --> 15:12.441
it's like putting raw meat
in a piranha tank. They'll eat him alive.

15:12.566 --> 15:13.780
You can't do that to him.

15:13.906 --> 15:17.253
I don't sell enough anti-depressants
to pay for it.

15:19.597 --> 15:23.950
When Kate died, I got a call
from her life insurance company.

15:24.075 --> 15:26.335
Here's my wife of eight years,
dies in a freak accident,

15:26.460 --> 15:28.260
and now they just want
to cut me a cheque.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.269
I felt pretty awkward about it.
I didn't know what to do.

15:30.437 --> 15:34.119
I never invested the money.
I just kept it in my savings account.

15:34.245 --> 15:37.551
Bottom line is, I'd like to use
that money to pay for Elliot's school.

15:37.676 --> 15:40.899
No. Ricky, that's too generous.

15:41.611 --> 15:44.414
You know, I didn't come here
to ask you for money.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.507
I didn't come here
to ask you for anything.

15:46.633 --> 15:49.897
I know that. I'm pretty sure
that's what Kate would've wanted.

15:50.022 --> 15:51.194
ELLIOT: You should move your pawn.

15:51.362 --> 15:52.617
Don't count on it.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.877
ALEXANDER: I don't need you
to teach me how to play chess, kid.

15:55.002 --> 15:58.351
I'm just saying if I were you,
I'd sacrifice my pawn.

15:58.476 --> 16:02.033
He really is a chip off the old Payne,
isn't he?

16:02.159 --> 16:06.261
- Alexander, you mind if I cut in?
- This kid's too smart for me.

16:06.386 --> 16:09.901
Well, don't blame it on him.
It's just his DNA, I guess.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.370
ALEXANDER: (CHUCKLING)
Unbelievable.

16:16.598 --> 16:20.949
- Do you mind if I finish his game?
- Sure, Professor. But you'll lose.

16:21.201 --> 16:22.540
(ELLIOT EX CLAIMS)

16:24.675 --> 16:27.311
How about you and I
start from scratch?

16:37.565 --> 16:39.992
(LIGHTS TWITCHING)

16:42.294 --> 16:43.884
Honey, I'm home.

16:50.915 --> 16:52.589
PAYNE: Oh, boy.

16:52.714 --> 16:57.318
How many times have I told you about
leaving your shoes in the foyer, Kate?

16:59.787 --> 17:02.423
You know, Kate,
the scientist in me is very intrigued,

17:02.591 --> 17:04.893
but the human being in me
has hair standing up

17:05.018 --> 17:07.906
in places I didn't even know
that I had hair.

17:10.711 --> 17:12.133
Whoa! Whoa!

17:13.305 --> 17:14.351
Wow.

17:15.481 --> 17:18.160
Come on, Kate.
Is that the best you got?

17:22.010 --> 17:24.144
All right. Getting better.

17:24.771 --> 17:25.986
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

17:29.292 --> 17:33.560
Oh, Honey, that is such
a textbook haunting.

17:41.512 --> 17:45.027
A screw?
Are you trying to tell me something?

17:45.154 --> 17:46.158
(SQUEAKING)

17:51.221 --> 17:54.946
Okay, fine! You want to have this out?
Let's have it out right now,

17:55.071 --> 17:58.294
'cause you cheated on me
with one of my colleagues!

17:58.420 --> 18:01.643
So what right do you have
to be mad at me?

18:01.768 --> 18:04.321
You think this is about infidelity?

18:04.823 --> 18:07.836
What was that, honey?
I didn't quite hear you.

18:11.310 --> 18:12.942
(EX CLAIMING IN PAIN)

18:16.416 --> 18:17.588
Payne, where are you?

18:17.713 --> 18:20.852
Here's something I never thought
I'd say. I'm in here under the piano.

18:21.020 --> 18:23.740
MELINDA: Oh, my God. Are you okay?

18:23.865 --> 18:25.749
Well, not to be Captain Obvious,
but not really!

18:25.874 --> 18:28.887
There's an 800-pound baby grand
on my back.

18:29.013 --> 18:30.185
(EX CLAIMS IN PAIN)

18:30.519 --> 18:31.942
Can you feel anything?

18:32.068 --> 18:34.202
Yes, Jim, I can feel everything.
Thank you.

18:34.328 --> 18:36.545
I'm going to get the car jack.

18:37.341 --> 18:38.932
I am so sorry.

18:42.196 --> 18:44.414
- JIM: How's that?
- Ah! It only hurts when it hurts.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.841
We're gonna have to get this X-rayed
and get you to the emergency room.

18:46.967 --> 18:48.641
So, are you going to
tell me what happened?

18:48.766 --> 18:50.482
Well, I was drunk, I came home,

18:50.607 --> 18:53.412
I decided to plough through my own
bookcase, swing from the chandelier,

18:53.495 --> 18:56.048
and then me and the piano
rolled around on the floor and...

18:56.174 --> 18:57.680
All right, I got in a fight with Kate.

18:57.806 --> 18:59.772
Yeah, she's obviously trying
to tell you something.

18:59.899 --> 19:01.698
Great. It's like ghost charades
with props.

19:01.866 --> 19:04.795
You know, she seemed pretty upset
the day that you met Elliot.

19:05.004 --> 19:06.845
Is there something
you're not telling me?

19:07.055 --> 19:08.812
Well, Kate wanted kids.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.659
And so did I, for a brief,
brief moment of insanity.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.458
And we tried everything.
All the fertility drugs.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.592
It was killing Kate
that nothing was working.

19:15.718 --> 19:17.936
And I told her don't worry about it,
I don't even want kids.

19:18.062 --> 19:21.285
But you know the way I have that great
talent for saying things the wrong way.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.749
It just... It got ugly.

19:22.874 --> 19:26.097
- And now you have one. A kid.
- And she doesn't.

19:26.222 --> 19:27.478
(WINCES IN PAIN)

19:27.603 --> 19:28.650
That hurt?

19:28.775 --> 19:30.575
Compared to being under a piano,
it's okay.

19:30.701 --> 19:32.625
Do you think that's why she's upset?
Because of Elliot?

19:32.752 --> 19:35.848
Well, I think it's only going to get worse
until she crosses over.

19:35.974 --> 19:39.322
Well, look, I don't speak ghost
and I don't do humility very well.

19:39.531 --> 19:41.582
Would you please talk to her?
Mediate. Whatever.

19:41.707 --> 19:42.921
- Yes.
- Hey, please!

19:43.047 --> 19:45.223
- Okay! Just stop baiting her.
- Thank you.

19:45.348 --> 19:47.525
I will not bait her any more.

19:49.659 --> 19:52.002
- What's that look?
- No look.

19:56.815 --> 19:58.950
- Hey.
- How is he?

19:59.075 --> 20:02.046
Lucky. His foot's pretty banged up.

20:02.173 --> 20:05.227
But hairline fracture of the tibia,
and he broke his little toe.

20:05.352 --> 20:06.902
He'll be fine.

20:10.542 --> 20:16.611
Look, I heard you two talking about
how much Payne's wife wanted a kid.

20:16.736 --> 20:18.243
And I hate to bring this up again, but...

20:18.369 --> 20:21.548
I'm so sorry.
Could you just hold that thought?

20:22.595 --> 20:24.102
I always do.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.981
You could have killed him.

20:44.106 --> 20:47.831
I lost my temper.
He has that effect on me.

20:48.584 --> 20:51.012
And anyway, I thought
he could stand to suffer a little.

20:51.137 --> 20:54.653
Hasn't he done that already?
I mean, it's been three years, Kate.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.996
It's time for you to let him move on.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.382
The way he's let me move on?

21:03.358 --> 21:05.576

21:05.702 --> 21:07.585
I know what he told you.

21:07.710 --> 21:10.932
I'm a ghost, darling.
I can go places, hear things.

to an otherwise lousy state.

21:21.562 --> 21:23.697
Sorry. That happens all the time.

21:23.822 --> 21:27.421
Look, obviously you're upset
that he has a child, okay?

21:27.547 --> 21:29.640
It doesn't seem fair, and I get that.

21:29.765 --> 21:30.980
Do you?

21:32.486 --> 21:35.875
She shows up here with this boy
and plays her sad little violin

21:36.002 --> 21:38.554
about needing money
to get him into some special school,

21:38.722 --> 21:41.317
and he's all too ready
to just write her a cheque

from my life insurance money no less.

- What happened?
- Broke my vestigial appendage.

22:20.279 --> 22:22.916
- I'm fine, though. Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.343
- Yeah, but just let me go first, okay?
- Okay.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.100
All right.

to pay for Elliot's school and...

I accept. And...
And I swear we'll go back to the city,

and you'll never hear from us again.

I've been thinking a lot about it, too,

22:40.953 --> 22:43.506
and I don't want
to be a chequebook dad, Nina.

22:43.674 --> 22:44.846
So the offer's no good any more?

22:44.971 --> 22:49.575
No, the... The offer still stands.
I just want to sweeten the pot.

22:49.700 --> 22:53.843
I... I've thought a lot about it,
and that is if I'm...

22:53.969 --> 22:59.200
Okay. If I'm going to be Elliot's dad,
then I want to be Elliot's dad.

23:00.498 --> 23:02.465
How would that work exactly?

23:02.590 --> 23:05.227
Well, we could take it slow.
You don't have to tell him right away.

23:05.352 --> 23:06.524
You guys can move in with me.

23:06.691 --> 23:09.202
Oh! Ricky, wait, slow down.

23:09.328 --> 23:13.262
No, it's not, you know...
I have lots of space, lots of space.

23:13.388 --> 23:16.233
And you and I, we don't have
to be this instant couple right away.

23:16.359 --> 23:18.786
We don't have to be
a couple at all even, you know.

23:18.911 --> 23:23.139
But there's a great satellite school that
the college offers for gifted children.

23:23.264 --> 23:25.942
We can enrol Elliot there and...

23:26.068 --> 23:30.170
I just... I don't know. I think I'm ready.
I'm really ready to be a dad.

23:30.295 --> 23:32.806
At least I'm ready to give it a try.

23:34.773 --> 23:37.619
So, how is this all going over at home?

23:37.744 --> 23:40.590
Well, you can tell that Jim wants
to talk about it. I keep sidestepping.

23:40.716 --> 23:42.097
I mean, what's the big rush, right?

23:42.264 --> 23:43.813
There's got to be
some huge compromise

23:43.939 --> 23:46.282
somewhere between forever
and right now.

23:46.449 --> 23:49.840
Yeah, except for men pretty much
have forever and women don't.

23:49.965 --> 23:52.894
I'm still young-ish. Okay?
There's plenty of time.

23:53.020 --> 23:54.569
Besides, I have to cross Kate over,

23:54.736 --> 23:56.954
and I can't do that
until I find out if Nina's telling the truth,

23:57.079 --> 24:00.302
which means you should stop
changing the subject.

24:00.428 --> 24:03.441
You know, you could always
get that P.I. You hired to help you out.

24:03.566 --> 24:06.663
And distract him from getting me more
information on my dad? I don't think so.

24:06.789 --> 24:08.379
You know what I really need to do

24:08.463 --> 24:10.179
is just yank a hair
right out of Payne's head

24:10.304 --> 24:11.727
and then do my own paternity test.

24:11.852 --> 24:16.038
You know, as much fun as that sounds,
I have a simpler idea.

24:19.009 --> 24:21.562
DELIA: Ready?
MELINDA: Mmm-hmm.

24:21.688 --> 24:23.236
<i>- WO MAN: May I help you?
- Hello, yes.</i>

24:23.362 --> 24:26.626
Is Principal Stickley available
for Dean Julia Marlow

24:26.751 --> 24:30.769
from the Archfield Academy?
It's regarding Elliot Haley.

24:31.062 --> 24:32.820
Mmm-hmm. I'll hold.

24:34.034 --> 24:37.800
- This sleuthing stuff is kind of fun.
- You're oddly good at it.

24:37.926 --> 24:39.097
<i>Principal Stickley.</i>

24:39.222 --> 24:41.985
Yes, one moment, please,
for Dean Marlow.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.752
<i>- Hello, Principal Stickley.
- Did you receive the application?</i>

24:45.877 --> 24:49.016
Yes, we did receive Elliot's application.

24:49.183 --> 24:51.778
But the birth certificate, though,
it was a fax of a fax,

24:51.904 --> 24:53.577
and so you know how that goes.

24:53.704 --> 24:55.586
We really need
to get the father's name.

24:55.713 --> 24:57.135
<i>Let me get the original copy.</i>

24:57.261 --> 24:58.349
Pen.

24:58.977 --> 25:01.069
<i>- I have it right here.
- Yes.</i>

25:01.194 --> 25:02.617
<i>(INAUDIBLE)</i>

25:04.333 --> 25:06.802
Thank you so much for your trouble.

25:07.891 --> 25:08.895
Damn.

25:12.788 --> 25:16.638
I think you're just beating yourself up
over an accident.

25:16.763 --> 25:20.864
Your time here, earthbound,
it's about your redemption.

25:20.989 --> 25:23.584
You did that. You made that sacrifice.

25:24.128 --> 25:28.356
- But is it that simple?
- It is if you can see the light.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.503
Yeah.

25:34.507 --> 25:37.688
Yeah, it's...
It's on the other side of that car.

25:38.609 --> 25:41.078
ZACH: What do I do?
MELINDA: Go into it.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.552
Sort things out on the other side.

26:03.720 --> 26:04.765
(EXHALES)

26:04.891 --> 26:07.695
- Another one?
- Yep, just a random ghost.

26:08.742 --> 26:10.751
Sometimes I wish
they'd just leave me alone.

26:10.834 --> 26:12.215
JIM: Yeah, you and me both.

26:12.340 --> 26:13.429
So, what am I going to do?

26:13.554 --> 26:15.939
I mean, am I going to talk to Rick,
am I going to confront Nina,

26:16.107 --> 26:18.409
or am I going to just move to Canada?

26:18.534 --> 26:22.929
- You'll figure it out. You always do.
- Well, that was really helpful. Thanks.

26:23.975 --> 26:25.482
You want my real opinion?

26:25.565 --> 26:27.741
I feel like you should tell Rick first.
Why?

26:27.867 --> 26:28.997
Because you guys
have so much in common.

26:29.122 --> 26:31.885
I think he'll be relieved
that the kid is not his.

26:32.010 --> 26:34.019
So that's why you're being distant.

26:34.144 --> 26:35.149
We've talked about this.

26:35.275 --> 26:37.828
Yeah, I know we've talked
and we've talked.

26:37.995 --> 26:40.464
Melinda, I've gotta say,
sometimes I feel like you use your gift

26:40.590 --> 26:42.766
as an excuse, and that you care more
about the dead than...

26:42.892 --> 26:46.742
That is not fair, okay?
I'm just not ready to have a baby.

26:46.867 --> 26:48.625
I'm beginning to wonder if you ever will.

26:48.751 --> 26:49.755
I mean,
we've been married three years.

26:49.881 --> 26:52.810
- Yeah, and we're still young.
- Yeah.

26:53.731 --> 26:57.205
So were Payne and Kate,
and look what happened to them.

27:01.683 --> 27:03.858
- I got to go to work.
- Yep.

27:05.658 --> 27:08.128
Let me know how it goes with Carl.

27:10.513 --> 27:14.656
I have to tell you upfront, Melinda,
your father left a pretty cold trail.

27:14.781 --> 27:16.330
Since 1989?

27:16.456 --> 27:20.432
'91. Two years after you said
he left you and your mother for good.

27:20.557 --> 27:23.110
Drained his bank account,
cashed out his IRA,

27:23.235 --> 27:26.165
went back to the woman in Colorado
he had a son with.

27:26.290 --> 27:28.341
- Gabriel. My half brother.
- And other than that,

27:28.467 --> 27:30.434
the only record I have of him
is working as a short-order cook

27:30.559 --> 27:32.442
at a Debby's in Arizona.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.782
What?

27:34.870 --> 27:37.256
My dad was a lawyer.
That doesn't make any sense.

27:37.381 --> 27:39.097
It does if he was on the run
from something.

27:39.222 --> 27:40.938
The run from what?

27:41.985 --> 27:45.165
Melinda, when you first asked me
to look into this,

27:45.291 --> 27:49.267
you told me your father was dead.
You're pretty certain of that?

27:51.066 --> 27:55.083
Yeah, I guess
I've been telling myself that for so long

27:55.209 --> 27:57.344
that I started to believe it.

27:58.139 --> 27:59.729
There's no record of his death?

27:59.855 --> 28:03.078
Not that I can find.
No burial. No cremation.

28:03.203 --> 28:04.960
And the list of John Does
in this country's huge.

28:05.086 --> 28:08.936
And without dental records or DNA,
it's a needle in a haystack.

28:10.108 --> 28:12.744
Look, I have some other leads,

28:14.252 --> 28:16.804
but I'm starting to feel guilty
taking your money.

28:16.930 --> 28:20.026
You found out more than I ever could.

28:20.153 --> 28:22.454
- Well, it's your call.
- Just don't give up.

28:22.621 --> 28:25.258
Please. I really need to know.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.168
PAYNE: So, I guess
the final question is just

28:33.293 --> 28:35.512
do I make the cheque out
to Archfield Academy?

28:35.637 --> 28:36.893
Or, I mean,
I could make the cheque out

28:37.018 --> 28:39.027
to the school that's here in Grandview.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.868
- I'm not trying to force a decision.
- Yeah, I know.

28:40.993 --> 28:44.300
I'm just going to need to take
some time to think about it, so...

28:44.425 --> 28:45.890
Maybe if you just
make the cheque out to me,

28:46.016 --> 28:47.438
I can put it into Elliot's school fund.

28:47.565 --> 28:50.870
That way, I can prove I can afford
whichever school he applies to.

28:50.954 --> 28:54.344
- What are these, Professor?
- Those are my fetishes.

28:54.469 --> 28:56.771
Ricky? He's 10.

28:56.897 --> 28:59.701
I know he's 10.
That's actually what they're called.

28:59.827 --> 29:00.831
They're called fetishes.

29:00.956 --> 29:04.263
They're carvings from
an ancient Zuni tribe from New Mexico.

29:04.430 --> 29:07.987
They carve each animal, and they think
that there's a spirit inside them

29:08.113 --> 29:10.038
giving each one a very specific power.

29:10.164 --> 29:12.591
Why don't you pick one up
and give it a try?

29:12.716 --> 29:16.023
(EX CLAIMING) The wily fox.
He keeps his owner safe.

29:16.148 --> 29:20.752
What you do is you put his nostrils
in your mouth and you inhale.

29:20.877 --> 29:24.769
- Go ahead. Give it a try.
- No, thanks. It's still flu season.

29:25.941 --> 29:27.532
Hi, everyone.

29:28.285 --> 29:30.755
- PAYNE: Hey.
- Actually, I'm here to see Nina.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.428
- You are?
- Yeah.

29:37.785 --> 29:41.844
- (EXHALING) Who's Brian Dobbs?
- Who?

29:41.970 --> 29:44.565
He was on the birth certificate
as the father.

29:44.690 --> 29:46.951
- How did you...
- I made a phone call.

29:47.076 --> 29:49.880
And I can make some more.
Do I need to?

29:50.005 --> 29:52.266
- It's not what you think.
- It's exactly what I think.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.488
But the question is,
are you going to tell Payne or am I?

29:55.613 --> 29:59.255
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- No, you're right on time.

30:00.427 --> 30:01.640
PAYNE: Technically,
I should have them stored

30:01.765 --> 30:03.230
in cornmeal. That's what they eat,

30:03.355 --> 30:04.570
and the more they eat,
the better they are,

30:04.695 --> 30:06.076
and the more power they have.

30:06.243 --> 30:09.634
Nina said that it was okay for Delia
to take Elliot for some ice cream.

30:09.759 --> 30:11.684
Okay. What's going on?

30:12.814 --> 30:15.283
Come on. We'll be in the cafeteria.

30:17.836 --> 30:19.594
Brian Dobbs?
The guy that used to hang out

30:19.761 --> 30:22.105
in the laundry room of our building,
Brian Dobbs?

30:22.231 --> 30:26.039
Anyway, he was nice to me after
you started hanging out with Kate

30:26.164 --> 30:28.047
and I saw the writing on the wall.

30:28.215 --> 30:30.014
So, he took advantage of you.

30:30.141 --> 30:33.070
After you left, I found out
I was three months pregnant.

30:33.195 --> 30:37.380
And when I told Brian,
he demanded I take a paternity test,

30:37.506 --> 30:39.765
which kind of backfired on him.

30:40.603 --> 30:45.080
He hung around for about a year,
then he split.

30:46.001 --> 30:47.509
MELINDA: Then what happened?

30:47.634 --> 30:50.814
NINA: Bastard stole
my Social Security number.

30:50.940 --> 30:53.368
All of a sudden, I've got
all these credit card bills piling up.

30:53.493 --> 30:55.795
I find out
he's drained my savings account,

30:55.920 --> 30:59.269
and I haven't heard from him since.

30:59.854 --> 31:04.584
He left me with a one-year-old
and buried under a mountain of debt.

31:04.709 --> 31:07.806
And I've been killing myself
trying to pay it off for years,

31:07.973 --> 31:11.322
and now it's going
to cost my son his school.

31:11.447 --> 31:14.251
I've never done
anything like this before.

31:15.716 --> 31:18.771
Why me? Why'd you start with me?

31:20.988 --> 31:24.713
I just thought the Rick Payne
I remembered would

31:24.839 --> 31:28.061
give me money
to make the problem go away.

31:28.187 --> 31:32.414
I never in a million years thought
you'd want to be in Elliot's life.

31:33.167 --> 31:36.306
So, I'm sorry for what I did.

31:38.106 --> 31:40.993
Mostly, I'm sorry I underestimated you.

31:41.119 --> 31:43.922
Well, you're not half as sorry as I am.

31:45.638 --> 31:47.480
I think you should go.

31:48.903 --> 31:51.038
Yeah, I think you should go.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.445
(DOOR CLOSES)

32:09.493 --> 32:14.055
Kate? Are you here?
'Cause he really wants to talk to you.

32:15.938 --> 32:18.157
(EX CLAIMING) Spooky. Is that it?

32:18.282 --> 32:21.504
I bet you feel really stupid now
that it turns out the kid isn't even mine,

32:21.630 --> 32:22.634
don't you, honey?

32:22.760 --> 32:24.853
Ask him how he thinks
it makes me feel to watch him,

32:24.978 --> 32:27.866
a man who told me flat out he didn't
want to have children with me,

32:27.991 --> 32:30.586
become completely
and utterly destroyed over some kid

32:30.711 --> 32:33.474
who wasn't even his to begin with.

32:33.599 --> 32:36.404
She's a little angry
at how upset you were

32:36.529 --> 32:38.413
when you found out
that Elliot wasn't yours.

32:38.538 --> 32:39.543
What's that got to do with us?

32:39.668 --> 32:44.565
I'll tell you exactly what that's got
to do with us, you miserable little...

32:44.690 --> 32:47.871
I will not repeat that.
And you, calm down.

32:47.996 --> 32:50.507
Why? What happened?
What did she say?

32:53.186 --> 32:57.329
She's angry because she thinks you
didn't want to have a baby with her.

32:57.454 --> 32:59.589
Wow, she thinks
I didn't want to have kids with her?

32:59.714 --> 33:02.727
- Kate, I... That's not what I said at all.
- Yes, you did! Repeatedly!

33:02.853 --> 33:04.401
PAYNE: I never once made this
about you or about me.

33:04.526 --> 33:06.494
- And you want to think that I'm selfish.
- "One more year.

33:06.620 --> 33:08.712
"We have so much time."
And look what that got us.

33:08.837 --> 33:10.386
KATE: So don't you dare call me selfish.

33:10.512 --> 33:11.725
You wanna think
that you're suffering all the time.

33:11.850 --> 33:13.190
You have no idea
how much you've made me suffer!

33:13.315 --> 33:14.738
You don't even know the damn truth!

33:14.864 --> 33:17.710
- All right, enough!
- She started it.

33:17.836 --> 33:19.845
I didn't get any of that, nor did I want to,

33:19.970 --> 33:23.945
but I did hear you say something
about him not knowing the truth.

33:24.071 --> 33:26.122
When we were trying to...

33:27.336 --> 33:30.683
When I thought he wanted children
as much as I did,

33:32.316 --> 33:36.584
we were doing in vitro.
Fertility injections and...

33:38.217 --> 33:42.109
- Were you going to tell me, Rick?
- I need a little more here.

33:42.235 --> 33:45.750
The dean called.
Your grant's been approved.

33:47.591 --> 33:52.195
Two years in Peru, and we're trying
to get pregnant, and you didn't tell me.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.752
Move over. Come on.

33:58.639 --> 34:04.498
Look, I am nowhere near ready
to have a child now, okay?

34:05.545 --> 34:07.303
But we're very young.
We have lots of time.

34:07.428 --> 34:11.529
We have all the time in the world,
so it's okay.

34:12.786 --> 34:14.920
(PHONE RINGING)

34:17.681 --> 34:19.230
Professor Payne.

34:20.318 --> 34:21.364
Sure.

34:24.127 --> 34:26.303
It's the fertility clinic.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.831
PAYNE: I know all this. They called.
They said her eggs were not viable,

34:33.041 --> 34:35.259
and then she accused me
of being relieved.

34:35.384 --> 34:37.476
We fought. Blah, blah, blah.

34:37.603 --> 34:38.775
KATE: I lied.

34:39.485 --> 34:42.121
The doctor said we were good to go.

34:42.248 --> 34:46.810
It was my one chance to get pregnant,
but because I knew he didn't want it,

34:48.442 --> 34:49.614
I lied.

34:50.911 --> 34:53.170
A few weeks later, I was dead.

34:54.301 --> 34:57.314
- What is it?
- She lied.

34:58.318 --> 35:01.583
She lied to you because she thought
you didn't want children.

35:01.709 --> 35:05.894
The doctor said it was a good time.
She thought it was her only chance.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.154
I didn't know.

35:09.074 --> 35:11.543
Well, if she lied,
why is she mad at me?

35:11.711 --> 35:15.812
I'm angry because you knew
I wanted children,

35:16.440 --> 35:17.905
and you said you wanted that, too.

35:18.072 --> 35:21.923
Then every time I brought it up,
you just pushed me away.

35:22.216 --> 35:25.647
But that didn't make it stop. Even now.

35:29.330 --> 35:31.381
I know it's not possible.

35:32.009 --> 35:35.148
So why does the ache only get worse?

35:40.839 --> 35:42.722
(CRYING) It hurts so much.

35:45.233 --> 35:48.916
- How can you make that go away?
- I can't.

35:51.930 --> 35:54.482
But you have to move on now.
I mean, you know that.

35:54.650 --> 35:56.281
You know I can't.

35:56.407 --> 35:58.458
Kate, please don't go.

36:06.619 --> 36:08.712
- Oh, my God.
- DELIA: What is it?

36:10.009 --> 36:13.524
Well, Kate told me about her death,
but listen to this old article.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.700
"A construction crane
plummeted eight storeys

36:15.826 --> 36:18.337
"at a Brookside office complex
late yesterday morning,

36:18.463 --> 36:21.769
"crushing to death a motorist
who was making a U-turn.

36:21.852 --> 36:24.740
"The victim, later identified
as Katherine Payne.

36:24.866 --> 36:27.963
"Payne died moments
before her body was freed."

36:28.130 --> 36:29.386
That is awful.

36:29.511 --> 36:33.068
How random.
Just making a U-turn. Wow.

36:33.194 --> 36:34.742
(DOOR CHIMES SOUNDING)

36:36.458 --> 36:39.932
Hi. I'm sorry just to show up like this.

36:40.057 --> 36:41.605
- No, no.
- No.

36:41.773 --> 36:42.945
What's going on?

36:43.699 --> 36:44.912
Go on.

36:48.763 --> 36:50.980
I took this from Professor Payne.

36:51.148 --> 36:57.007
My mom wants you to give it back
to him for me, and tell him I'm sorry.

36:59.853 --> 37:01.903
Look, I may not be
the world's best role model,

37:02.029 --> 37:04.833
but I'm trying to raise
an honest kid here.

37:06.590 --> 37:08.599
No, you know what?

37:08.725 --> 37:12.031
Maybe you should do this yourself.
In person.

37:13.831 --> 37:16.802
Pretty sure
Ricky never wants to see me again.

37:16.928 --> 37:19.272
I think you might be surprised.

37:23.958 --> 37:26.972
Are you crazy?
I told you I never want to see her again!

37:27.097 --> 37:29.441
That's why I put you in a moving car
before I told you.

37:29.567 --> 37:32.747
Why don't you just waterboard me
instead? Wait a minute.

37:32.915 --> 37:34.505
This is where Kate died.
I hate this place.

37:34.631 --> 37:35.761
Why would you bring me here?

37:35.886 --> 37:38.523
I'm trying to kill two birds
with one ghost. Come on.

37:39.611 --> 37:41.159
PAYNE: Well, thanks.

37:42.373 --> 37:43.713
What is it?

37:44.633 --> 37:46.767
The fox fetish is in there.

37:47.437 --> 37:50.451
I took good care of him,
just like you said.

37:50.576 --> 37:55.012
- You took it from me without asking?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

37:57.774 --> 38:00.661
I just thought
it'd keep my mom and me safe.

38:03.717 --> 38:04.846
Okay.

38:05.642 --> 38:07.692
I thought you'd be here.

38:08.362 --> 38:12.841
Seems like I'm always here.
There's this constant pull.

38:12.966 --> 38:16.230
It's because this is where
your time was cut short.

38:17.025 --> 38:21.754
I don't usually reward thievery,
young man,

38:21.880 --> 38:24.098
but I'm going to make an exception.

38:24.265 --> 38:28.283
I want you to do me a favour, Elliot.
I want you to take this box,

38:28.451 --> 38:30.250
and I want you to keep it.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.966
Because that way, you'll always know

38:32.091 --> 38:35.607
that somebody's looking out
for you and your mommy, okay?

38:45.734 --> 38:48.539
- Damn him.
- PAYNE: All right. Okay, listen. Go...

38:49.752 --> 38:51.134
Why don't you go wait
in the car or something?

38:51.259 --> 38:53.561
I have to talk to your mom, okay?

38:53.687 --> 38:55.486
Thank you, Professor.

39:00.843 --> 39:04.484
Well, if I felt stupid before,
I really feel stupid now.

39:05.907 --> 39:07.957
He really got accepted
to Archfield Academy?

39:08.082 --> 39:12.017
- Yeah. Yeah, that much is true.
- That's good.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.779
That's good. I'm proud of him.
And I'm still paying for it.

39:14.905 --> 39:19.131
- You don't have to do that, Ricky.
- I know. That's why I'm doing it.

39:20.513 --> 39:23.568
And for the record, after that first night,
I wasn't gonna go through with it,

39:23.694 --> 39:26.497
but then you just surprised me.

39:28.297 --> 39:31.059
And I started wishing it was true.

39:31.226 --> 39:33.486
My grandma used to say, "Wish again,

39:33.612 --> 39:36.499
"because you got bad luck
on that last one."

39:49.348 --> 39:52.654
There's another reason
why you keep getting drawn here.

39:52.779 --> 39:55.374
I think it's what you're really mad about.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.844
You wanted more time.
And you were mad at him

39:57.969 --> 40:01.233
because he always promised
that there would be more.

40:02.614 --> 40:04.330
It's not his fault.

40:05.083 --> 40:08.264
Well, I don't have to guess
who you're talking to, do I?

40:08.390 --> 40:09.771
Hello, Kate.

40:10.817 --> 40:13.537
- KATE: Hi.
- She says, "Hi."

40:14.416 --> 40:16.592
I don't want you to be mad at me,
but I...

40:16.718 --> 40:19.313
I can't stand the thought of that
little boy not getting what he needs,

40:19.438 --> 40:21.824
whether he's my son or not.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.874
She doesn't seem angry.

40:25.422 --> 40:28.269
I'm sorry the guy I was
didn't want to have kids.

40:28.395 --> 40:32.914
It was because I was selfish.
I just wanted you all for myself.

40:36.095 --> 40:40.112
I think I needed to believe
that Elliot was my son because

40:41.954 --> 40:43.920
I don't have you any more.

40:48.064 --> 40:51.956
I'm sorry I didn't forgive you.
I forgive you.

40:53.128 --> 40:56.852
But I couldn't before
because I wasn't ready to let you go.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.494
Crap.

41:02.209 --> 41:04.721
- You see it, don't you?
- KATE: Yeah.

41:04.846 --> 41:06.478
It's magnificent.

41:07.734 --> 41:10.705
Tell him I said I still love him.

41:13.426 --> 41:17.066
And I think
he'll make a wonderful father someday.

41:17.192 --> 41:18.741
I promise.

41:20.665 --> 41:22.172
Goodbye, Rick.

41:29.454 --> 41:32.718
Tell him he should put his ring
in the sock drawer.

41:33.556 --> 41:38.578
That way when he opens it,
he'll think of me every now and again.

Wow. You've got
the wedding china out. What's...

42:18.713 --> 42:23.357
- What's the occasion?
- Just celebrating life. That's all.

42:24.404 --> 42:27.836
Look, I'm sorry about today.
I'm not mad, if this is what this is about.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.761
No. It's not. Not at all.

42:29.887 --> 42:36.248
I was just thinking about what you said,
and you're right.

42:36.415 --> 42:39.721
I mean, we never know
what's going to happen.

42:42.400 --> 42:46.083
Wait a minute. Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

42:49.179 --> 42:50.895
Let's have a baby.

42:56.503 --> 43:00.898
- Look, don't do this just for me. Don't...
- No, it's for us. Life is too short.

You know,
what the hell are we waiting for?

43:06.296 --> 43:08.682
- God, I love you.
- I love you.

43:14.541 --> 43:17.303
- Don't answer it.
- JIM: Oh, no. It's Carl.

43:17.429 --> 43:18.935
I told him to come by. He wanted to...

43:19.061 --> 43:21.070
- Okay. All right.
- I'm... All right.

43:26.803 --> 43:28.143

- Hi.

43:28.854 --> 43:31.156
Look, I'm sorry. This is it,

43:31.281 --> 43:34.545
everything I could find on your father,
which isn't much.

43:35.424 --> 43:37.015
