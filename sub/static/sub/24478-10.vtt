00:03.344 --> 00:05.724
Jackson Allen Whitmore
of Washington Heights

00:05.862 --> 00:08.586
is accused of shooting
Officer Jacob Lockman.

00:08.724 --> 00:10.620
Ms. Hastings recently
joined our office, your honor.

00:10.758 --> 00:11.931
Interesting.

00:12.068 --> 00:13.724
You need to get you
some groceries

00:13.862 --> 00:15.724
and for God's sake you need
to leave that Flame bolt alone,

00:15.862 --> 00:16.862
that stuff will kill you.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.551
Officer, isn't-

00:18.689 --> 00:20.206
You do have a small arrhythmia
and your blood pressure

00:20.344 --> 00:21.586
was through the roof
when you came in.

00:22.896 --> 00:23.965
Franklin!

00:24.206 --> 00:25.724
Franklin, it's me, Gwen!

00:25.862 --> 00:27.862
The disciplinary committee?
they're investigating you?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.206
So we gotta make
an enemies list.

00:29.344 --> 00:31.172
Advance America Payday loans.

00:31.310 --> 00:33.413
Girl, they have
called you four times

00:33.551 --> 00:35.206
Why is it that
you can't accept my help?

00:35.344 --> 00:36.896
You know you haven't
set foot in this building

00:37.034 --> 00:38.310
to come and see me in court?

00:38.448 --> 00:40.344
Holy shit, Tessa?
Campanelli?

00:40.482 --> 00:42.758
The statute says
you can't claim self-defense

00:42.896 --> 00:44.379
if you were
resisting arrest.

00:44.517 --> 00:47.034
What if we argue that
there wasn't an actual arrest?

00:47.172 --> 00:48.689
- It was as assault.
- By whom?

00:48.827 --> 00:50.206
The officer!

00:50.344 --> 00:51.758
So this guy gets out of his car,
just hits me on the chin,

00:51.896 --> 00:53.000
so we fought!

00:53.137 --> 00:54.448
Did you file a police report?

00:54.586 --> 00:56.103
Yes, but he was a cop!

00:56.241 --> 00:57.344
I just broke up with Ben.

00:57.482 --> 00:58.827
Oh, honey,

00:58.965 --> 01:00.206
then this is gonna really
make you feel terrible.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.344
Come on! It's ridiculous.

01:18.482 --> 01:19.827
It's a rap video!

01:19.965 --> 01:21.137
Shakespeare wrote MacBeth ,

01:21.275 --> 01:22.379
it don't make him a murderer.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.172
I don't know, it's not good.

01:24.448 --> 01:25.862
It obviously says
something about the guy.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.344
Morning, Gwen.

01:27.482 --> 01:28.896
Who writes lyrics
about killing cops?

01:29.034 --> 01:30.724
Sounds like
a pretty violent person.

01:30.862 --> 01:32.620
A lot of people on that jury are thinking what you just said.

01:32.758 --> 01:34.655
Gwen Sullivan cannot have
had a good night's sleep.

01:45.965 --> 01:46.931
It's bad, right?

01:47.551 --> 01:48.793
The song?

01:48.931 --> 01:50.137
- I wish we would've known.
- I'm sorry.

01:50.275 --> 01:51.655
It's not your fault
we didn't find it

01:51.793 --> 01:53.896
but we need to know
if there's anything else.

01:54.586 --> 01:55.793
No, no I don't think so.

01:55.931 --> 01:57.862
- Are you sure?
- I don't know.

01:58.724 --> 02:00.068
I'm tryin' to think

02:00.206 --> 02:01.482
but I didn't think
to tell you about the video.

02:02.931 --> 02:04.068
Are we losin'?

02:04.206 --> 02:05.379
They did their side,
now we have to

02:05.517 --> 02:06.413
- do ours.
- But are we losing?

02:06.551 --> 02:07.862
No, we're not losing.

02:08.965 --> 02:10.172
Guards in this shell keep sayin'

02:10.310 --> 02:12.137
dead man walking
every time I walk by.

02:13.137 --> 02:14.793
Startin' to have dreams
about dyin' here.

02:14.931 --> 02:16.068
You listen to me.

02:16.655 --> 02:18.344
I'm not gonna let that happen.

02:18.482 --> 02:20.689
Not for talking back to a cop,
and not for defending yourself,

02:20.827 --> 02:22.827
it's not happening.

02:24.275 --> 02:25.965
We gotta give him breakfast.

02:27.172 --> 02:28.793
This case is not over Jackson.

02:31.689 --> 02:33.172
I need you to stay positive.

02:33.517 --> 02:35.275
Face me, hands in front.

02:52.586 --> 02:55.241
The cop never said
you're under arrest or anything

02:55.379 --> 02:56.724
he was just so angry,

02:56.862 --> 02:58.241
he grabbed the kid,
put him in a chokehold.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.862
Don't speculate, okay?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.517
You can describe
what he was doing,

03:01.655 --> 03:02.724
or what he said
to make you think

03:02.862 --> 03:03.827
that he was angry,

03:03.965 --> 03:05.379
but you can't say he was angry,

03:05.517 --> 03:07.517
because you can't really
know what he was thinking.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.586
Okay.

03:08.724 --> 03:10.034
How's she doin'?

03:10.172 --> 03:11.793
Pretty standard mock crash,
she'll be fine.

03:12.241 --> 03:13.206
What about Ty?

03:13.448 --> 03:14.655
Hasn't shown up yet.

03:15.034 --> 03:16.724
I do not like this.

03:17.827 --> 03:18.689
You ok?

03:18.931 --> 03:20.172
Mmm, caffeine headache,

03:20.310 --> 03:21.379
I quit the Flame bolts.

03:21.862 --> 03:23.758
I think we should go get him,
can you go?

03:23.896 --> 03:25.275
Yes, boss.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.413
Chop chop.

03:41.551 --> 03:42.689
Ty, it's Charlie Rich,

03:42.827 --> 03:44.206
from the public
defender's office.

03:44.862 --> 03:46.172
Look, I know
you don't wanna do this,

03:46.310 --> 03:47.482
but you're under subpoena.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.275
Why are you yelling? It's open.

03:49.413 --> 03:50.275
Excuse me?

03:50.413 --> 03:51.793
Are you here for the open house?

03:52.413 --> 03:54.241
Just take an application
from the counter,

03:54.379 --> 03:56.551
and leave it with
the building manager downstairs.

04:08.517 --> 04:11.482
Ma'am!
The man who used to live here,

04:11.655 --> 04:13.103
Ty Ching, you know
where he went?

04:13.241 --> 04:15.689
He moved.
California, I heard.

04:16.206 --> 04:18.310
- Immigration came to visit him.
- Immigration?

04:18.448 --> 04:19.586
- Mm hmm.
- Are you sure?

04:19.724 --> 04:21.206
That's what people say.

04:23.551 --> 04:29.896
All lives matter!

04:33.482 --> 04:34.965
We had a witness
who would testify

04:35.103 --> 04:37.172
that Officer Lockman
assaulted him while off-duty.

04:37.310 --> 04:38.241
I've just been informed

04:38.379 --> 04:39.275
that witness has disappeared

04:39.413 --> 04:40.931
and I would like the court

04:41.068 --> 04:42.137
to ask the people about
their communication with him.

04:42.275 --> 04:43.310
What are you trying to say?

04:43.448 --> 04:44.413
I wanna know whether the people

04:44.551 --> 04:45.862
encouraged him to disappear.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.068
You wanna know
if I tampered with a witness

04:47.206 --> 04:48.068
and committed a felony?

04:48.206 --> 04:49.793
You're damn right I do.

04:49.931 --> 04:51.724
Did your office have any contact
with the witness, Mr. DeShay?

04:51.862 --> 04:53.034
Of course we did,

04:53.172 --> 04:54.655
I had an investigator
interview him.

04:54.793 --> 04:56.137
Did you happen to instruct
that investigator to talk

04:56.275 --> 04:57.448
about his legal status,
maybe in passing?

04:57.586 --> 04:58.758
No, I did not, and frankly,

04:58.896 --> 04:59.931
I find that
insinuation insulting.

05:00.068 --> 05:01.517
Oh please.

05:01.655 --> 05:02.931
Judge, we took a video
of the witness's statement,

05:03.068 --> 05:04.068
he's unavailable,
so we want to admit

05:04.206 --> 05:05.482
that video into evidence.

05:05.758 --> 05:06.758
He fled, he's not dead!

05:06.896 --> 05:08.068
The circumstances are reliable.

05:08.206 --> 05:10.000
Your honor,
this is classic hearsay.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.896
The alleged incident
was investigated

05:12.034 --> 05:14.275
by internal affairs
and determined to be unfounded.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.344
- This office, the client pro-
- A cop?

05:16.482 --> 05:18.655
Investigated by other cops,
found not responsible?

05:18.793 --> 05:19.931
I'm so surprised.

05:20.068 --> 05:20.965
We can't cross-examine
a videotape.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.482
Alright, alright, enough.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.275
I'm afraid
Ms. Hastings is correct,

05:24.413 --> 05:26.172
the witness statement
is hearsay.

05:26.310 --> 05:28.448
Your honor, this testimony goes
directly to whether the officer

05:28.586 --> 05:30.000
was the initial aggressor.

05:30.379 --> 05:31.482
I have spoken.

05:31.620 --> 05:33.724
The witness statement
is inadmissible.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.000
We're adjourned
until this afternoon.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.827
All rise.

05:49.034 --> 05:49.931
Dad.

05:50.068 --> 05:51.275
Hello, honey.

05:51.482 --> 05:52.862
I tried to call you,

05:53.103 --> 05:54.137
but you didn't answer.

05:54.275 --> 05:55.896
- I've been busy.
- And angry.

05:56.034 --> 05:57.724
I can't talk
about this right now.

06:03.344 --> 06:04.931
- Did you?
- Did I what?

06:05.655 --> 06:06.896
Intimidate their witness?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.620
Depends on your definition
of intimidating.

06:08.758 --> 06:10.206
Oh, don't play coy with me EJ!

06:10.344 --> 06:12.275
Vena, stop acting like
you're still a defense attorney.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.655
It's one thing
to put all the evidence

06:13.793 --> 06:15.379
on table and let
the truth shake out,

06:15.862 --> 06:16.827
it is another thing,

06:16.965 --> 06:18.206
to put your thumb on the scale.

06:18.931 --> 06:20.241
You remember your client?

06:20.379 --> 06:21.586
The one that burnt
his girlfriend to death

06:21.724 --> 06:22.758
and killed a witness?

06:23.068 --> 06:24.379
You know what I had to do

06:24.517 --> 06:26.137
after you went and let him
walk out the door?

06:26.413 --> 06:27.931
I had to talk to the families.

06:28.482 --> 06:29.655
That woman's mother.

06:30.034 --> 06:31.206
That witness's wife.

06:31.344 --> 06:32.241
Talk to me
when you've had to do that

06:32.379 --> 06:33.551
a few dozen times.

06:34.068 --> 06:35.655
Gwen has never
done anything unethical.

06:35.827 --> 06:36.724
Neither have I.

06:37.241 --> 06:38.793
I asked two cops
to question a witness

06:38.931 --> 06:40.172
because that's my job.

06:40.310 --> 06:41.517
And if there is
a delightful side benefit

06:41.655 --> 06:42.758
to that, then great.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.034
This is an adversarial
process, Vanessa.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.724
It is, by definition,

06:46.862 --> 06:48.448
not a truth-seeking one.

06:49.379 --> 06:50.448
Both sides play hard,

06:50.586 --> 06:51.793
and throw elbows to win.

06:51.931 --> 06:53.275
And sometimes,
the truth shows up

06:53.413 --> 06:55.379
along the way, that's the game.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.275
Get used to it.

07:02.551 --> 07:04.379
This is actually
really comfortable.

07:05.379 --> 07:08.000
You know, that stain kinda
looks like Michael Jackson.

07:10.137 --> 07:11.413
I never noticed that.

07:12.620 --> 07:15.068
I hate to say it,
but we might be in trouble.

07:15.724 --> 07:17.172
There's gotta be a way
we can prove that the cop

07:17.310 --> 07:18.965
was violent and not Jackson.

07:20.034 --> 07:22.034
I looked at the Civilian Review
Panel Reports,

07:22.172 --> 07:24.275
they didn't make
any statements we could use.

07:25.137 --> 07:27.241
What if Jackson testifies
he knew the cop,

07:27.379 --> 07:29.448
and knew that he had
a bad reputation.

07:29.655 --> 07:31.517
So we get it in to show
Jackson's state of mind?

07:31.655 --> 07:33.793
Jackson knew he should be afraid
of Lockman

07:33.931 --> 07:35.206
and reacted accordingly.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.241
Wait, did Jackson know the cop?

07:37.413 --> 07:38.517
He could.

07:39.137 --> 07:40.517
You know what?
The gloves are off.

07:40.655 --> 07:42.137
He's facin' life without.

07:43.275 --> 07:45.206
All I'm saying it that
it could be a little risky.

07:45.586 --> 07:47.793
Jackson could end up
looking like a liar,

07:48.103 --> 07:49.275
and if he goes down,

07:49.413 --> 07:50.724
he could turn on us
and rat us out.

07:57.827 --> 07:58.931
Am I interrupting something?

07:59.241 --> 08:01.310
We're just planning
DeShay's execution.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.620
That's not a bad idea,

08:02.793 --> 08:04.000
'cause you got a problem.

08:09.827 --> 08:10.896
I can't use you now!

08:11.034 --> 08:12.137
You're compromised!

08:12.965 --> 08:14.344
It was $10,000.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.172
My son just got
into private school,

08:16.310 --> 08:17.275
and we're struggling.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.793
We talked about this, Jeanine,

08:18.931 --> 08:20.482
I told you people were
gonna offer you money.

08:20.620 --> 08:22.551
They promised
that they were gonna wait

08:22.689 --> 08:23.965
until after I testified.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.000
Why on earth would
they do that, Jeanine?

08:27.137 --> 08:28.413
I don't know.

08:37.655 --> 08:38.862
Damn it!

08:40.758 --> 08:42.103
She was the only witness!

08:42.517 --> 08:44.862
I feel like the universe
is conspiring against us!

08:45.000 --> 08:46.413
Okay, take a breath,

08:46.724 --> 08:47.517
tell me what you need.

08:47.655 --> 08:48.931
A Flame bolt!

08:49.068 --> 08:49.827
I'm sorry, I'm not
gonna be your pusher.

08:49.965 --> 08:50.965
I hate you.

08:51.103 --> 08:52.413
I can live with that.
Sit.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.896
We could still use Jeanine.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.137
And list it up front
that she sold her story.

09:03.275 --> 09:04.620
Thirty witnesses saw
what happened!

09:04.758 --> 09:06.275
And everybody says
something different!

09:06.413 --> 09:09.344
She's the only one who fully
backs up Jackson's story!

09:09.655 --> 09:11.482
She'll just look like
she made it up to get a payoff,

09:11.620 --> 09:13.448
and we'll look like
liars by extension

09:13.586 --> 09:14.758
if we use her!

09:16.413 --> 09:18.724
I cannot lose this case, Tom.

09:19.241 --> 09:21.310
I cannot let him die in prison

09:21.448 --> 09:23.724
and do not tell me
I'm too passionate!

09:26.103 --> 09:28.103
You're not gonna
let him die in prison.

09:29.758 --> 09:32.482
We won't let him, okay?

09:33.379 --> 09:34.206
Now close your eyes.

09:34.344 --> 09:35.586
- Tom!
- No, close 'em.

09:37.931 --> 09:39.655
I want you to picture yourself,

09:40.172 --> 09:42.448
in a gym, boxing.

09:43.103 --> 09:44.965
You're opponent is DeShay.

09:45.793 --> 09:48.655
I want you to see yourself
beating the shit out of him.

09:48.965 --> 09:49.931
He's on the mat,

09:50.379 --> 09:51.310
you're standing over him,

09:51.448 --> 09:53.379
he's bloody, incoherent!

09:55.793 --> 09:58.137
Now, open your eyes.

09:59.172 --> 10:00.724
And tell me your next move.

10:05.068 --> 10:06.689
We leak Ty's story
to the press.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.103
Look, I know I can get
held in contempt again,

10:09.241 --> 10:11.862
I know I can get
banned again, I don't care.

10:12.172 --> 10:13.586
We got witnesses
dropping like flies,

10:13.724 --> 10:15.172
Judge Adler is
the least of my worries,

10:15.310 --> 10:17.068
- I just wanna get this-
- Settle down!

10:18.068 --> 10:20.206
I was gonna offer
to leak it for you.

10:24.896 --> 10:26.275
Welcome back!

10:27.517 --> 10:29.034
Now let's crush them.

10:43.448 --> 10:45.827
Hey! Yes, I saw your text,

10:45.965 --> 10:47.965
but I ignored them,
do you wanna know why, sugar?

10:48.103 --> 10:51.172
Because like I said,
the way this works is I call you

10:51.310 --> 10:52.965
if I want, when I want, okay?

10:53.103 --> 10:54.689
You don't call me
or text, or anything,

10:54.827 --> 10:55.620
do you got it?

10:55.758 --> 10:57.344
Good, bye-bye now.

10:58.413 --> 10:59.482
Man!

11:01.517 --> 11:03.068
Judge Dodson, Judge Fordman,

11:03.206 --> 11:04.862
Vannesa, what game is this?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.206
Smash, marry, kill?

11:06.344 --> 11:08.689
Are my supervisor
right now or my friend?

11:09.689 --> 11:10.862
Friend.

11:12.068 --> 11:14.103
I slept with Dodson,
tampered with a jury,

11:14.241 --> 11:17.000
and somebody reported me
to the bar association.

11:17.551 --> 11:21.586
Hmm, so... suspects?

11:23.517 --> 11:25.000
Really, Judge Myers?

11:25.137 --> 11:27.000
Honey, it's his mustache.

11:27.137 --> 11:28.000
Okay.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.068
And what is that?

11:30.413 --> 11:31.620
Well, according to Gwen,

11:31.758 --> 11:33.379
I might have somebody
in my blind spot.

11:33.517 --> 11:34.724
Maybe.

11:36.655 --> 11:37.793
Not to state the obvious,

11:37.931 --> 11:39.344
but listening to you
on the telephone

11:39.482 --> 11:42.000
are you sure it's not
some guy that you screwed

11:42.137 --> 11:43.206
and then screwed over?

11:43.344 --> 11:45.068
Oh shit, you think?

12:09.344 --> 12:10.379
Damn.

12:10.586 --> 12:11.965
You're my hero.

12:13.448 --> 12:14.931
I'm gonna leave you to it.

12:24.275 --> 12:25.620
Hey! Kyle?

12:25.758 --> 12:26.896
Yeah, it's me, honey.

12:27.103 --> 12:29.793
I was just wondering,
are we good?

12:29.931 --> 12:32.275
I mean, you're not
still upset, are you?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.310
The court officer saw this

12:38.448 --> 12:40.724
sticking out of
Juror number five's purse.

12:41.206 --> 12:42.758
Do you wanna tell me
who's responsible for it?

12:42.896 --> 12:44.137
It wasn't me, Judge.

12:44.275 --> 12:45.344
Oh come on, who else
would benefit from this?

12:45.482 --> 12:46.827
Wow, that is the same question

12:46.965 --> 12:48.620
I asked myself
when my witness disappeared.

12:48.758 --> 12:50.931
I'm requesting Juror number
five be dismissed, your honor.

12:51.068 --> 12:52.448
Why? The jury's not sequestered?

12:52.586 --> 12:53.655
Ah-ha, they are now.

12:53.793 --> 12:55.034
- Your honor
- Enough!

12:55.586 --> 12:57.000
I've had it with both of you.

12:57.517 --> 13:00.137
Juror number five is dismissed.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.758
And I'll have colloquy
with the entire panel

13:02.896 --> 13:04.586
to see if anyone else saw it.

13:04.965 --> 13:07.379
Now, call your first witness.

13:11.896 --> 13:13.344
I just had done a topside 360

13:13.482 --> 13:14.689
and when I landed
I saw the officer

13:14.827 --> 13:16.517
coming towards me,
so I slowed down

13:16.655 --> 13:18.827
but I didn't hear anything
'cause I had my headphones in.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.137
Did you stop?

13:20.310 --> 13:21.827
Yeah, when he
took my headphones off,

13:21.965 --> 13:23.206
he was screamin' at me.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.793
Askin' me, why I wasn't
listening to him.

13:24.931 --> 13:26.172
And I told him I couldn't hear,

13:26.551 --> 13:28.655
and then he said,
can you hear me now?

13:29.689 --> 13:31.000
I was nervous so I laughed,

13:31.517 --> 13:32.620
'cause you know the commercial?

13:33.034 --> 13:34.862
Anyway, he just started
screaming at me

13:35.000 --> 13:36.896
and callin' me a punk
and disrespectful,

13:37.413 --> 13:38.689
and then he grabbed me
by the arm

13:38.827 --> 13:40.034
and started pulling me
and I pulled back

13:40.172 --> 13:41.310
and asked what I did,

13:41.448 --> 13:42.241
and he went
ballistic from there.

13:42.379 --> 13:43.275
What do you mean?

13:44.034 --> 13:45.068
He tried to grab my skateboard,

13:45.206 --> 13:46.655
then he put me in a headlock,

13:47.103 --> 13:48.172
then we were on the ground,

13:48.310 --> 13:49.517
and he kept choking me.

13:49.758 --> 13:51.413
I kept tryin' to tell him
I wasn't resisting.

13:51.758 --> 13:52.896
I don't know,

13:53.517 --> 13:55.206
I was getting limp
and I couldn't breathe,

13:55.344 --> 13:56.413
I thought I was gonna die.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.482
So what did you do?

13:57.620 --> 13:58.896
He was kinda flailin' so,

13:59.275 --> 14:00.896
I felt his gun
and I pulled on it,

14:02.310 --> 14:04.068
that was just the instinct
to get him off me.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.172
But the gun went off.

14:07.241 --> 14:08.655
Look, I wasn't tryin'
to kill him.

14:08.896 --> 14:10.000
I was just tryin'
to save myself,

14:10.137 --> 14:11.379
I thought it was
either him or me.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.379
Jackson, did Officer Lockman

14:13.517 --> 14:15.344
ever tell you that
you were under arrest?

14:15.689 --> 14:16.724
No, he didn't.

14:19.344 --> 14:20.931
No further questions.

14:26.827 --> 14:29.275
Mr. Whitmore, you knew
that skateboarding was

14:29.448 --> 14:32.517
illegal in Washington Heights
Community Plaza, didn't you?

14:32.724 --> 14:33.931
Yeah, but everybody does it.

14:34.068 --> 14:35.379
So when Officer Lockman
stopped you,

14:35.517 --> 14:36.827
you knew why he stopped you,

14:36.965 --> 14:38.172
it's because you did
something illegal, right?

14:38.310 --> 14:40.034
- I guess.
- Yes or no?

14:40.655 --> 14:41.931
Yes.

14:42.068 --> 14:43.517
So when he took your arm,
and you pulled away

14:43.655 --> 14:45.379
it's because you didn't
wanna go with him, correct?

14:45.758 --> 14:47.206
I don't think
I was thinking anything,

14:47.344 --> 14:48.724
I just thought he was
pullin' my arm really hard

14:48.862 --> 14:50.758
and I reacted
by pullin' my arm back.

14:51.172 --> 14:52.689
You testified and said,

14:52.931 --> 14:54.137
"What did I do?"
To Officer Lockman,

14:54.275 --> 14:55.551
but you know what you had done?

14:55.689 --> 14:57.241
You had committed a crime,
hadn't you?

14:57.379 --> 14:59.379
Well, I guess, but I didn't
think I deserved to be-

14:59.551 --> 15:00.862
To what, to be arrested?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.482
- No.
- Really?

15:04.862 --> 15:07.034
Stop resisting!

15:07.206 --> 15:08.482
I'm not resisting!

15:08.620 --> 15:09.551
- Stay down!
- I'm not resisting!

15:12.896 --> 15:14.655
Mr. Whitmore,
that is an interesting

15:14.793 --> 15:15.793
choice of words, isn't it?

15:15.931 --> 15:17.172
I'm not resisting.

15:17.413 --> 15:18.448
I don't know.

15:18.758 --> 15:19.896
You didn't say "get off me",

15:20.034 --> 15:21.206
or "what are you doin'?",

15:21.344 --> 15:23.275
or "stop, you're hurting me",
did you?

15:23.413 --> 15:24.310
No.

15:24.448 --> 15:25.896
You said, I'm not resisting.

15:26.034 --> 15:27.448
What exactly
were you not resisting?

15:27.586 --> 15:28.482
He was beating me up.

15:28.620 --> 15:29.586
Well, you didn't say stop,

15:29.724 --> 15:30.931
you're beating me up, did you?

15:31.068 --> 15:32.206
- He was choking me.
- You didn't say,

15:32.344 --> 15:33.413
"stop, you're choking me",
did you?

15:33.551 --> 15:34.379
I thought he was gonna kill me.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.482
You didn't say stop,

15:35.620 --> 15:37.275
you're gonna kill me, did you?

15:38.000 --> 15:38.827
No.

15:38.965 --> 15:40.137
So stop resisting arrest

15:40.275 --> 15:41.793
is the only thing
that he could've said

15:41.931 --> 15:43.758
for you to say,
"I'm not resisting"?

15:44.206 --> 15:45.448
I'm not sure.

15:45.586 --> 15:47.310
Well he didn't say,
"Sit down", did he?

15:47.448 --> 15:49.344
- Well, I don't- No.
- Yes or no.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.413
He didn't say,
"I need to talk to you", did he?

15:51.896 --> 15:53.241
- Yes or no?
- No.

15:53.379 --> 15:55.448
He didn't say,
"Stop messing around", did he?

15:56.241 --> 15:57.551
- Yes or no?
- No.

15:57.689 --> 15:59.758
He said, "You're under arrest",
didn't he?

16:00.275 --> 16:01.206
Didn't he?

16:02.275 --> 16:03.931
I don't- I don't remember.

16:05.793 --> 16:07.172
I have nothing further.

16:16.413 --> 16:17.620
We don't have a case.

16:17.758 --> 16:18.965
Hate to admit it,
but DeShay has a point

16:19.103 --> 16:20.517
with this "I'm not resisting".

16:21.379 --> 16:23.586
Do not tell me there's
a Flame bolt in that bag.

16:23.724 --> 16:25.172
I'm not drinking it,

16:25.310 --> 16:26.586
I'm just carrying it around
like maybe this caffeine

16:26.724 --> 16:27.862
will seep into my skin
by osmosis.

16:28.000 --> 16:28.931
You need help.

16:29.068 --> 16:30.206
Okay, you've a problem.

16:30.344 --> 16:31.793
That's what I'm sayin'.

16:31.965 --> 16:34.172
No, he means we have a problem,
Sherlock. And we do.

16:34.310 --> 16:35.482
You lost your eyewitness,

16:35.620 --> 16:36.931
you have no proof
of excessive force,

16:37.068 --> 16:38.931
other than Jackson's testimony,

16:39.068 --> 16:41.137
and DeShay flipped
even that against you.

16:41.344 --> 16:42.517
We need to shift gears,

16:42.655 --> 16:44.000
we keep trying to argue that

16:44.172 --> 16:45.482
there was never an arrest,

16:45.620 --> 16:46.689
and he just straight up
assaulted Jackson,

16:46.827 --> 16:47.965
but what if we let that go?

16:48.103 --> 16:49.517
Then how do we argue
self-defense?

16:49.655 --> 16:51.758
Hold up, why are you
lettin' her drink that?

16:51.896 --> 16:52.965
No!

16:53.103 --> 16:53.862
Good reflexes.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.310
It was instinctual.

16:59.793 --> 17:01.413
Shh, shh, she's thinking.

17:01.551 --> 17:03.586
Just holding the bottle
gives her energy.

17:03.724 --> 17:06.724
Jackson kept saying shooting
Lockman was instinctual.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.586
What if we actually argued that?

17:08.758 --> 17:10.896
Like it was
a human survival response.

17:11.034 --> 17:12.965
Like when people panic
in a fire and someone dies

17:13.103 --> 17:14.551
no one meant to kill anyone.

17:14.862 --> 17:15.758
Is that a defense?

17:15.896 --> 17:17.103
Human survival response?

17:17.379 --> 17:19.103
- It is now.
- It would be arguing

17:19.241 --> 17:20.413
lack of intent to kill.

17:20.551 --> 17:21.931
Yeah but we give it
a fancy name.

17:22.103 --> 17:24.172
So what do we do?
Get an expert?

17:25.310 --> 17:28.000
Yeah, but not the kind
you're thinking of.

17:28.137 --> 17:29.310
A lifeguard?

17:29.517 --> 17:31.586
To testify as
to human survival response?

17:31.724 --> 17:32.931
Are you kidding me?

17:33.068 --> 17:34.310
Judge the statute
says that a defendant

17:34.448 --> 17:35.827
cannot use force
to resist an arrest.

17:35.965 --> 17:37.517
My client didn't shoot
Officer Lockman

17:37.655 --> 17:38.620
to resist an arrest,

17:38.758 --> 17:40.103
he was reacting instinctively,

17:40.310 --> 17:42.275
we're arguing that
he didn't have intent to kill.

17:43.137 --> 17:45.275
You have to admit,
that's a creative way

17:45.413 --> 17:47.586
to illustrate
lack of intent, counselor.

17:47.724 --> 17:49.310
This is a murder trial,
your honor,

17:49.448 --> 17:50.655
not a creativity contest.

17:50.793 --> 17:52.758
And with all due respect,
it's not funny.

17:53.137 --> 17:55.000
You know what else
is not funny, counselor?

17:55.137 --> 17:56.827
Life without parole.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.724
I shall afford the defense
a bit of latitude.

17:59.862 --> 18:01.793
This lifeguard
isn't a neurologist

18:01.931 --> 18:03.068
or a psychologist.

18:03.448 --> 18:05.758
So how exactly would
he give expert testimony

18:05.896 --> 18:07.965
regarding human
survival response?

18:08.103 --> 18:09.586
Well, we'll see, won't we?

18:09.724 --> 18:10.896
Your honor!

18:11.034 --> 18:12.413
If you don't like it,
Mr. DeShay,

18:12.551 --> 18:14.586
make the defendant an offer.

18:14.724 --> 18:15.965
Excuse me?

18:16.103 --> 18:17.275
I haven't said anything
up until now,

18:17.413 --> 18:19.241
because a police officer
is deceased,

18:19.379 --> 18:21.586
so politically
it's not an option,

18:21.724 --> 18:24.103
but why hasn't there
been an offer?

18:24.448 --> 18:26.103
This has nothing to do
with politics.

18:26.241 --> 18:27.586
- Oh please, EJ.
- Are you trying

18:27.724 --> 18:29.931
to strong-arm the people
into making an offer?

18:30.206 --> 18:31.448
Not at all.

18:32.206 --> 18:35.172
I'm just telling you that
if you don't like my ruling,

18:35.482 --> 18:37.206
you're free to make an offer.

18:40.448 --> 18:41.689
20 to 40 years?

18:42.931 --> 18:44.000
How is that an offer?

18:44.137 --> 18:45.517
It takes life off the table.

18:45.655 --> 18:47.620
Do you think you can win this?

18:48.655 --> 18:50.206
To be honest, I don't know.

18:50.344 --> 18:52.586
The judge is allowing us to
put the lifeguard on the stand,

18:52.931 --> 18:54.413
but losing the witness
was not good,

18:54.551 --> 18:56.137
- and Jackson's testimony-
- I don't understand

18:56.275 --> 18:57.413
how this is happening.

18:57.896 --> 19:00.241
20 to 40 years
for riding a skateboard?

19:00.931 --> 19:02.275
Trying to defend myself?

19:04.275 --> 19:05.793
He was gonna kill me.

19:09.241 --> 19:10.413
- You gotta take it, son.
- No.

19:10.551 --> 19:11.482
What you talkin' about?

19:12.172 --> 19:13.793
At least after 20 he'll
be able to apply for parole.

19:13.931 --> 19:15.379
If he takes 20 to 40,

19:15.517 --> 19:16.862
you know damn well he's doin' 40

19:17.000 --> 19:18.689
they're not
paroling a cop killer.

19:18.827 --> 19:19.862
He's gonna have a chance--

19:20.000 --> 19:21.137
When he's 60!

19:21.275 --> 19:22.482
I didn't do anything!

19:22.620 --> 19:23.758
Which is why you're not
pleading guilty!

19:23.896 --> 19:25.034
- Loretta
- No!

19:25.172 --> 19:26.310
I'm not gonna
let them do this to him!

19:26.448 --> 19:28.103
He did not do anything wrong!

19:29.862 --> 19:31.068
Everything we could.

19:31.655 --> 19:33.413
Try to teach him
how to deal with the cops,

19:33.551 --> 19:34.931
don't argue, don't talk back,

19:35.068 --> 19:37.379
keep your hands
out of your pocket, don't run.

19:37.896 --> 19:39.000
But if you don't fight back

19:39.137 --> 19:40.275
then they try and kill you

19:40.413 --> 19:41.862
and if you do fight back,
then this.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.068
So no!

19:43.448 --> 19:46.103
You had better try
and win this, Ms. Sullivan.

19:46.344 --> 19:48.551
Because we are not backing down.

19:50.206 --> 19:52.241
I am not giving them my son.

19:58.344 --> 19:59.862
Mr. Givens,
how are you employed?

20:00.034 --> 20:02.379
I was a lifeguard for the city
of New York for 10 years,

20:02.517 --> 20:04.103
I've been Chief Instructor
for the Red Cross,

20:04.241 --> 20:06.206
for the past five,
and I head the city's

20:06.344 --> 20:08.000
water safety
instructor program.

20:08.137 --> 20:09.379
Basically, I train the people

20:09.517 --> 20:10.655
who train the lifeguards.

20:10.827 --> 20:12.068
Have you actually saved people?

20:12.206 --> 20:14.034
Yeah, I have 212 saves.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.862
You saved 212 lives,
that's impressive.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.793
Not really, it's just training.

20:18.931 --> 20:20.896
And can you tell us
how you're trained

20:21.137 --> 20:23.172
to avoid specific danger
to yourself

20:23.310 --> 20:24.310
when saving someone?

20:24.448 --> 20:26.000
Yeah, well there's a phenomenon

20:26.137 --> 20:27.620
that every lifeguard
is familiar with,

20:27.758 --> 20:29.275
when someone is drowning,
they panic

20:29.413 --> 20:31.310
and will instinctively
grab onto the lifeguard

20:31.448 --> 20:33.275
and push him down
to keep themselves afloat.

20:33.413 --> 20:35.896
Lifeguards have been killed
by being pushed under the water.

20:36.172 --> 20:37.965
It's why we're trained to
approach someone from behind

20:38.103 --> 20:39.448
and grab them
around their chest.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.862
And these people who panicked,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.758
and pushed their
lifeguards underwater,

20:42.896 --> 20:44.758
are they doing
this intentionally?

20:45.137 --> 20:46.482
No, they're not to blame,

20:46.620 --> 20:48.586
like I said, it's a natural
human response.

20:50.379 --> 20:54.241
Mr. Givens, do you have any
personal experience with this?

20:54.586 --> 20:57.000
I do, yeah, a buddy
of mine was killed

20:57.137 --> 20:59.068
three years ago by someone
who was drowning.

20:59.206 --> 21:00.620
That person survived.

21:01.172 --> 21:02.655
Was he prosecuted for murder?

21:02.793 --> 21:03.965
- Objection!
- No.

21:04.206 --> 21:07.034
Sustained, the jury
will disregard

21:07.172 --> 21:09.103
the last question and answer.

21:10.034 --> 21:11.275
No further questions.

21:16.413 --> 21:18.137
Mr. Givens,
the defendant testified

21:18.275 --> 21:19.862
regarding shooting the officer.

21:20.551 --> 21:21.551
"I didn't mean to kill him,

21:21.689 --> 21:22.965
I was trying to save my life,

21:23.103 --> 21:24.931
I thought it was him or me".

21:25.586 --> 21:27.275
Do you think that
people who try to put

21:27.413 --> 21:29.655
lifeguards under are thinking,
it's him or me?

21:29.793 --> 21:31.103
Objection!

21:31.241 --> 21:32.517
He's offering the witness
as an expert, your honor.

21:32.655 --> 21:33.758
Overruled.

21:34.517 --> 21:36.379
No, people describe it as almost

21:36.517 --> 21:37.758
an absence of all thought,

21:37.896 --> 21:39.172
it's like
a fight or flight thing.

21:39.310 --> 21:40.482
All animal instinct.

21:40.620 --> 21:42.310
So given that
Mr. Whitmore said that

21:42.448 --> 21:45.413
he thought it was him or me,
his actions weren't consistent

21:45.551 --> 21:47.551
with the phenomenon
that you described?

21:47.689 --> 21:49.068
- Objection!
- Objection!

21:49.206 --> 21:52.275
Overruled. You opened
this door, counselors.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.758
I guess it doesn't really
seem like the same thing.

21:59.310 --> 22:01.862
Thank you, no further questions.

22:07.931 --> 22:09.379
I don't understand,
what happened?

22:11.551 --> 22:13.034
What happened?

22:13.862 --> 22:15.103
It wasn't good.

22:15.965 --> 22:19.413
Gwen, Gwen.

22:23.862 --> 22:25.827
Hakeem,
I need five f lame bolts.

22:25.965 --> 22:27.310
I'm sorry, Gwen, I can't.

22:27.448 --> 22:28.379
Look, I know I told you
not to sell me any,

22:28.517 --> 22:29.827
but I really need one.

22:29.965 --> 22:31.172
You tell me I should
refuse to sell you any

22:31.310 --> 22:32.551
- no matter what you said.
- I know,

22:32.689 --> 22:33.758
but I'm saying
right now it's okay.

22:33.896 --> 22:34.896
You said you would tell me that.

22:35.034 --> 22:36.206
Hakeem, sell me the Flame bolt

22:36.344 --> 22:37.724
it's an emergency
I don't feel right,

22:37.862 --> 22:38.931
I think I actually
need the caffeine.

22:39.068 --> 22:40.310
No, you said, Hakeem,

22:40.448 --> 22:41.862
I will ask you,
then I will cajole you,

22:42.000 --> 22:43.275
then I will beg you,
then I will threaten you,

22:43.413 --> 22:44.310
then I will probably
tell you that

22:44.448 --> 22:45.551
it's a medical necessity.

22:45.689 --> 22:46.655
But no matter what I do,

22:46.793 --> 22:47.931
don't sell me the Flame bolts

22:48.068 --> 22:50.344
- so I'm-
- I swear I will hurt you.

22:50.655 --> 22:52.862
Sell me the Flame bolt.

22:54.965 --> 22:56.241
No.

22:56.413 --> 22:57.413
Gwen!

22:57.724 --> 22:59.206
Come back!

22:59.344 --> 23:00.620
Do not close that door.

23:01.931 --> 23:04.758
Gwen! Open the door!
Gwen.

23:05.137 --> 23:06.137
Gwen!

23:06.344 --> 23:07.931
Gwen, let me in!

23:08.482 --> 23:09.551
Open this door!

23:10.068 --> 23:11.482
I need the Flame bolt!

23:11.620 --> 23:13.724
No, you don't,
you have an arrhythmia,

23:13.862 --> 23:14.793
it's a bad idea!

23:14.931 --> 23:15.862
You know what's a worse idea?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.310
Me trying to do a summation,

23:17.448 --> 23:19.000
- feeling the way I'm feeling.
- Oh yeah?

23:19.137 --> 23:21.241
How are you gonna feel
when you pass out in court?

23:21.379 --> 23:23.344
Oh stop being so dramatic,
it's Flame bolt.

23:23.482 --> 23:24.620
No, honey, it's not,

23:24.758 --> 23:26.862
you were just in the hospital.
God!

23:27.103 --> 23:28.931
When is the last time
you even had a proper meal?

23:29.068 --> 23:30.724
Jesus Christ,
you sound like Bennett.

23:30.862 --> 23:32.517
Do not harp on me
for what I eat.

23:32.655 --> 23:33.758
Oh don't you dare.

23:33.931 --> 23:35.172
Don't you lump me in with him,

23:35.310 --> 23:36.413
I am your best friend,

23:36.551 --> 23:37.965
and I'm callin' it
like I see it.

23:38.137 --> 23:39.655
Honey, you're taking
yourself down.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.000
God, this shit with the
Flame bolts and your money

23:42.206 --> 23:43.448
and your unopened mail.

23:43.689 --> 23:44.758
Yeah, which by the way,

23:44.896 --> 23:46.241
I decided to actually open.

23:46.379 --> 23:47.965
Yeah, you're damn straight
I did.

23:48.482 --> 23:50.172
You got a letter
from your bank telling you

23:50.310 --> 23:51.517
that your account is frozen

23:51.655 --> 23:52.793
because of that stupid
payday loan?

23:52.931 --> 23:54.000
Do you even know that, Gwen?

23:54.137 --> 23:55.241
Did you know that?

23:55.413 --> 23:56.379
That is so wrong.

23:56.517 --> 23:57.586
Oh honey!

23:58.310 --> 23:59.758
You're missing the point!

24:00.482 --> 24:02.620
Look, I don't care
about your money, okay.

24:02.758 --> 24:04.137
I just care about you.

24:04.517 --> 24:05.896
You're gonna do what you want,

24:06.034 --> 24:07.241
and you can do it,

24:07.379 --> 24:09.206
but I'm done
pretending like it's okay.

24:10.586 --> 24:13.137
I can't watch you self-destruct.
I will not.

24:22.448 --> 24:23.379
Gwen.

24:23.655 --> 24:25.000
We're screwed, Charlie,

24:25.137 --> 24:27.206
totally, utterly,
and completely screwed.

24:27.344 --> 24:28.379
Eh, it's okay.

24:28.551 --> 24:30.137
No, it's not okay.

24:30.896 --> 24:32.137
I was too cocky.

24:33.034 --> 24:34.068
What was I thinking?

24:34.482 --> 24:36.103
A lifeguard, seriously?

24:36.862 --> 24:38.482
The jury must be laughing at me.

24:39.137 --> 24:40.344
It was a little weird.

24:41.689 --> 24:42.655
It was.

24:42.793 --> 24:43.827
Good weird.

24:44.206 --> 24:45.275
It's just didn't land.

24:45.793 --> 24:47.068
You're gonna have
to come up with plan C.

24:47.206 --> 24:48.344
I don't have a plan C.

24:48.482 --> 24:51.413
That's why I'm here,
okay, so just

24:54.172 --> 24:56.551
take this.

24:59.793 --> 25:01.068
Wait, what?

25:01.206 --> 25:04.724
I can't watch you
struggle anymore, okay?

25:04.862 --> 25:06.793
You quit when we're done,
when it's over.

25:06.931 --> 25:08.965
I'll help you, by teasing you.

25:10.344 --> 25:11.862
I don't even have
a quippy response right now

25:12.000 --> 25:15.482
because I am deeply,
deeply in love with you.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.379
Shh, drink and think.

25:46.724 --> 25:47.586
Better?

25:47.724 --> 25:49.034
Yeah.

25:49.310 --> 25:52.931
Good, now put on your big girl
panties and let's go.

25:54.206 --> 25:55.413
I don't know, I just keep

25:55.655 --> 25:57.586
looking at the
self-defense statute.

25:58.379 --> 25:59.448
Hello, Gwendolyn.

25:59.965 --> 26:01.724
Your father stopped in
to say hello, I thought,

26:01.862 --> 26:02.931
since he was a judge,

26:03.068 --> 26:04.310
I would pull him in.

26:05.103 --> 26:06.241
That's great.

26:06.413 --> 26:08.068
You were talking
about the defense statute.

26:08.689 --> 26:10.793
Yeah, it says you can't
claim self-defense

26:11.413 --> 26:13.206
if you're resisting arrest,
the idea being that

26:13.344 --> 26:15.586
if you start the violence
it's your fault,

26:15.965 --> 26:17.931
but if you resist
arrest initially,

26:18.068 --> 26:19.172
but then you submit,

26:19.413 --> 26:20.413
it can't just be the law that

26:20.551 --> 26:21.793
if a cop uses excessive force

26:21.931 --> 26:23.482
you have to just
let yourself be killed?

26:23.620 --> 26:25.344
But the problem is we haven't
proved excessive force.

26:25.551 --> 26:26.931
But the kid has
a crushed larynx,

26:27.068 --> 26:28.724
I mean, that's not enough?
C'mon.

26:28.862 --> 26:30.655
Because he's a big
scary black man,

26:30.793 --> 26:33.034
he's the one considered
violent, not the cop.

26:33.206 --> 26:34.724
White people believe the cops,

26:34.896 --> 26:36.655
they don't get stopped and
dealt with aggressively by them.

26:36.793 --> 26:38.965
The question is, how do we
convince a New York City jury

26:39.103 --> 26:41.241
the kind that did not indict
the cop that killed Eric Garner,

26:41.379 --> 26:43.275
to see that race
is at play here?

26:44.275 --> 26:45.586
C...

26:46.379 --> 26:47.827
Daddy, what did you
say a second ago?

26:47.965 --> 26:50.448
Because he's a big
scary black man,

26:50.793 --> 26:52.517
he's the one considered violent.

26:54.551 --> 26:56.517
And that is our plan C.

26:58.931 --> 27:00.482
Wait, what is plan C?

27:00.620 --> 27:04.103
We have no idea,
trust me, Mr. Sullivan,

27:04.896 --> 27:06.068
it'll be good.

27:06.241 --> 27:07.758
Dr. Sanders, is this
the photograph taken

27:07.896 --> 27:09.103
of Mr. Whitmore's neck

27:09.241 --> 27:10.689
when he's admitted
to Hollowbrook Hospital?

27:10.827 --> 27:12.241
Yes, it is.

27:12.379 --> 27:14.551
And it shows the bruising
around his crushed windpipe.

27:14.689 --> 27:15.827
Yes.

27:15.965 --> 27:17.482
Now, could this injury
have been caused

27:17.620 --> 27:18.689
by a chokehold?

27:18.827 --> 27:19.724
Yes, it could.

27:19.862 --> 27:21.241
Let me be more specific.

27:26.172 --> 27:27.482
Um, what's going on here?

27:27.620 --> 27:29.034
I'm allowed to demonstrate,

27:29.172 --> 27:30.448
that's why it's called
demonstrative evidence.

27:30.586 --> 27:31.965
Now if Officer Lockman
had his arm

27:32.103 --> 27:34.620
around Mr. Whitmore's neck,
like this--

27:34.758 --> 27:37.655
Objection! Your Honor,
this is totally prejudicial,

27:37.793 --> 27:38.620
look at the size difference.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.137
Come on, Ms. Sullivan.

27:41.068 --> 27:43.724
Oh I'm sorry,
you're totally right, I'm sorry.

27:52.965 --> 27:54.379
Now as I was saying,

27:54.517 --> 27:56.344
if the officer was choking
my client, like this--

27:56.482 --> 27:57.758
Objection!

27:58.068 --> 27:59.620
Your Honor, they look
exactly the right size to me.

27:59.758 --> 28:01.000
Yeah, but this man is--

28:03.793 --> 28:04.862
Black?

28:06.620 --> 28:09.275
Jackson Whitmore is sitting in
that chair because he's black.

28:12.034 --> 28:13.413
He's being charged with murder

28:13.551 --> 28:15.413
because he's black
and in a sense,

28:16.482 --> 28:18.310
Officer Lockman is dead,

28:18.758 --> 28:21.724
because Jackson Whitmore
is black.

28:22.310 --> 28:23.862
Mr. DeShay basically
just admitted it

28:24.000 --> 28:26.689
so why don't we just
finally say what is true?

28:28.103 --> 28:30.310
Why don't we finally
just admit to each other,

28:30.448 --> 28:31.965
that if you were
to take a black cop,

28:32.103 --> 28:34.827
and a white kid
skateboarding in a park,

28:34.965 --> 28:36.448
what you get is a ticket.

28:37.103 --> 28:38.448
You get a summons.

28:38.655 --> 28:40.413
But Jackson is black
so there was a confrontation.

28:40.551 --> 28:43.034
And an escalation,
and the brutality of violence

28:43.172 --> 28:46.000
so severe that it
crushed his windpipe.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.620
This kid, this college kid

28:48.758 --> 28:50.241
who has never been
arrested before.

28:50.413 --> 28:51.689
He was faced

28:51.827 --> 28:54.482
with a life-changing
choice in that moment.

28:55.379 --> 28:57.793
Kill, or be killed.

28:59.517 --> 29:00.862
The only question
in this case is

29:01.000 --> 29:03.758
whether you believe that
a black man has to agree

29:03.896 --> 29:06.965
to die every time a cop
asks him a question

29:07.103 --> 29:08.655
or puts his hands on him.

29:09.896 --> 29:11.413
I'm not resisting!

29:11.551 --> 29:13.448
I'm not resisting!

29:14.103 --> 29:15.931
Those are the words
of a young black man

29:16.068 --> 29:19.655
desperately trying
to convince a cop

29:20.862 --> 29:22.689
that he doesn't pose a threat.

29:24.586 --> 29:26.103
It's too bad
he couldn't have just said,

29:26.241 --> 29:28.000
"Imagine I'm white".

29:42.827 --> 29:43.758
If you punched me,

29:43.896 --> 29:45.241
and I punched you back,

29:45.793 --> 29:48.103
you could not then,
hit me with a tire iron

29:48.241 --> 29:49.310
and claim self-defense.

29:49.448 --> 29:50.482
That makes sense, doesn't it?

29:50.862 --> 29:52.172
Because you are the one
who brought force

29:52.310 --> 29:53.517
to the table to begin with.

29:53.655 --> 29:54.862
You started it.

29:55.689 --> 29:57.206
Jackson Whitmore
was being arrested,

29:57.344 --> 29:59.586
we know this because
he said "I'm not resisting".

30:00.206 --> 30:02.793
That statement
makes no sense

30:02.931 --> 30:05.758
unless it is in response
to Officer Lockman saying,

30:05.896 --> 30:08.586
"You are under arrest,
and stop resisting that arrest".

30:09.482 --> 30:12.551
He is the one
who began to use force.

30:13.068 --> 30:15.758
And he resisted enough
to provoke a response

30:15.896 --> 30:17.655
from Officer Lockman.

30:17.793 --> 30:19.137
To believe otherwise
is to believe

30:19.275 --> 30:21.793
that Officer Lockman
decided to forcefully

30:21.931 --> 30:23.862
choke someone that day
for no reason.

30:24.724 --> 30:26.034
When he resisted,

30:26.241 --> 30:28.724
he forfeited his right
to claim to self-defense.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.137
It is the law.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.000
It has to be the law.

30:33.896 --> 30:37.620
Otherwise criminals
can violently resist arrest.

30:38.241 --> 30:40.241
And when a police officer
responds with force,

30:40.379 --> 30:41.931
they can kill
that police officer.

30:42.413 --> 30:44.206
That is not the world
I wanna live in.

30:44.344 --> 30:45.758
It is not the world we should

30:45.896 --> 30:48.068
have our police officers work in.

30:48.689 --> 30:51.413
Jackson Whitmore is not here
because he is black.

30:51.551 --> 30:53.103
He is here because
he broke the law.

30:53.275 --> 30:55.896
He resisted arrest,
he killed a police officer

30:56.034 --> 30:57.931
and now he wants to walk away.

30:58.724 --> 31:00.068
Don't let him.

31:28.862 --> 31:30.137
Thank you.

31:33.034 --> 31:35.000
Thank you for coming
to see me in court.

31:35.896 --> 31:37.068
You're welcome.

31:37.655 --> 31:39.793
I should've been there
sooner, I'm sorry.

31:41.586 --> 31:42.965
What else did you
wanna talk about?

31:44.551 --> 31:45.827
I don't know,

31:46.517 --> 31:47.724
I feel like my life

31:47.862 --> 31:49.379
isn't turning out the way
I pictured it.

31:49.517 --> 31:51.724
I'm not sure
anyone's does, baby.

31:52.724 --> 31:54.551
I love my job,
but I don't know much longer

31:54.689 --> 31:56.000
I can keep doing it.

31:56.724 --> 31:58.034
I might win
the occasional skirmish

31:58.172 --> 31:59.862
but I'm losing the overall war,

32:00.000 --> 32:01.068
and then there's Bennett,

32:01.206 --> 32:02.482
- I just
- Hmm.

32:02.896 --> 32:04.655
I have to tell you
that I have never thought

32:04.793 --> 32:06.206
that you and Bennett
were good for each other.

32:06.344 --> 32:08.310
- Really, Dad--
- No, no, no. Hear me.

32:08.586 --> 32:10.137
What I mean is, is that Bennett

32:10.275 --> 32:11.862
is not man enough for you.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.586
Oh, go on.

32:15.793 --> 32:17.413
Bennett is looking for someone

32:17.551 --> 32:18.758
he can put on a pedestal.

32:18.896 --> 32:20.482
Someone he can admire.

32:21.344 --> 32:22.379
More importantly, he's looking

32:22.517 --> 32:24.310
for someone to admire him.

32:25.793 --> 32:27.068
When you were his student,

32:27.379 --> 32:28.517
he could deal with that.

32:29.310 --> 32:30.758
Now, not so much.

32:32.482 --> 32:34.172
You're a tough woman, Gwendolyn.

32:34.724 --> 32:37.206
Not a lot of men
can appreciate that.

32:37.344 --> 32:38.758
That's what I'm afraid of.

32:39.344 --> 32:40.931
That I'm never
gonna find the guy

32:41.103 --> 32:42.482
who can deal with me.

32:42.620 --> 32:43.862
He's out there.

32:44.655 --> 32:46.931
And when you find him,
he's gonna be special.

32:49.551 --> 32:50.896
Now,

32:52.586 --> 32:53.862
as far as work goes,

32:54.000 --> 32:54.931
Oh, God.

32:55.137 --> 32:56.413
I want you to hear me.

32:58.724 --> 33:01.655
I have never been more
proud of you in my life.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.103
Win or lose this case,

33:04.241 --> 33:05.724
you have fought
brilliantly for that young man,

33:05.862 --> 33:08.379
you have fought
brilliantly for our community.

33:09.172 --> 33:11.310
Take a vacation, take a break,

33:11.517 --> 33:13.413
do whatever you
have to do to reboot,

33:13.551 --> 33:15.896
but get back
on those battlements.

33:17.137 --> 33:18.413
We need you out there.

33:19.344 --> 33:20.620
Thanks, Dad.

33:24.724 --> 33:26.413
Dad, I have something
to tell you.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.068
I have a problem with money.

33:38.448 --> 33:40.137
You always have
a problem with money.

33:40.275 --> 33:42.620
No, I'm saying that I have

33:43.793 --> 33:46.586
an issue with money.

33:48.931 --> 33:50.793
It's gotten pretty bad, I...

33:51.137 --> 33:52.793
I had to take out a payday loan.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.793
And they froze my bank account.

33:57.172 --> 33:58.586
I really need your help.

34:04.724 --> 34:07.000
What if I cleaned your slate?

34:07.724 --> 34:09.068
Took you back to zero?

34:09.620 --> 34:11.068
I can't ask you to do that, Dad.

34:11.206 --> 34:13.655
You're not asking, I'm offering.
How much is it?

34:14.551 --> 34:16.310
It's $50,000.

34:21.655 --> 34:23.034
Done.

34:27.137 --> 34:28.655
Hear me.

34:30.448 --> 34:31.827
This is it.

34:35.655 --> 34:36.965
Thank you.

34:39.206 --> 34:40.482
You're welcome, baby.

34:44.206 --> 34:45.862
I knew you guys
would still be here.

34:46.068 --> 34:47.241
Thought you went
home with Tracy.

34:47.379 --> 34:48.413
No, I don't know how she sleeps

34:48.551 --> 34:49.379
when the jury's out.

34:49.517 --> 34:50.206
I went to see my Dad.

34:50.586 --> 34:52.413
Mmm, how'd that go?

34:52.827 --> 34:54.172
Well, surprisingly not that bad.

34:54.413 --> 34:56.034
Told me Bennett
wasn't man enough for me.

34:56.172 --> 34:57.206
I could've told you that.

34:57.344 --> 34:57.862
What?

34:58.482 --> 35:00.103
He just seemed to have a...

35:01.517 --> 35:04.034
image of you that
he wanted you to fulfill.

35:04.793 --> 35:06.068
What, you guys think
I don't see things?

35:06.206 --> 35:06.862
I see everything.

35:07.000 --> 35:07.689
That is scary.

35:07.827 --> 35:08.689
Okay, I'm done.

35:10.793 --> 35:12.103
I'll see you inside.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.620
Sorry about Bennett.

35:16.379 --> 35:17.206
Tom's right.

35:18.034 --> 35:19.344
We're both stuck in the past

35:19.482 --> 35:21.034
we had these images
of who we used to be,

35:21.275 --> 35:22.448
and we were each
in love with the image

35:22.586 --> 35:23.793
and not who we really were.

35:24.379 --> 35:25.586
Well, for what it's worth,

35:26.172 --> 35:27.689
it's his loss.

35:27.827 --> 35:29.068
Thanks, Charlie.

35:30.137 --> 35:31.448
No, I'm for real.

35:34.413 --> 35:35.655
Gwen?

35:35.965 --> 35:36.965
Uh oh.

35:38.344 --> 35:39.896
Can I talk to Gwen for a minute?

35:40.034 --> 35:42.172
Whatever you wanna say to me,
you should to him too, so.

35:42.827 --> 35:44.000
Okay.

35:44.965 --> 35:48.000
I'm sorry, I'm really
sorry for leaving

35:48.137 --> 35:49.413
and not telling you.

35:49.586 --> 35:51.689
A conversation would've been
nice and no even.

35:51.896 --> 35:52.827
What else?

35:52.965 --> 35:54.103
What do you mean?

35:54.241 --> 35:55.275
How about I'm sorry
I told DeShay

35:55.413 --> 35:56.413
about your opening statement,

35:56.551 --> 35:57.758
I'm sorry I broke your trust?

35:57.896 --> 35:59.551
I didn't think
he was gonna steal it.

35:59.689 --> 36:00.827
He wouldn't have been able to
if you hadn't had told him.

36:00.965 --> 36:02.068
I'm sorry.

36:02.724 --> 36:04.413
Nuh-uh, don't look at me.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.379
You know why
I'm being a bitch right now?

36:06.620 --> 36:08.068
Because I actually cared
about you.

36:08.310 --> 36:10.448
I invested and you
just bugged out.

36:10.586 --> 36:12.034
I bugged out
because the PD's office

36:12.172 --> 36:13.586
was not the right place for me.

36:13.724 --> 36:15.482
And the DA's office is?

36:16.551 --> 36:17.758
I don't know.

36:17.896 --> 36:19.275
You know you're not gonna
find it, right?

36:19.413 --> 36:20.758
What?

36:20.896 --> 36:23.310
That perfect, well-manicured
hand sanitized life?

36:23.827 --> 36:25.758
That job with
the black and white rules.

36:26.275 --> 36:27.965
I know your parents meant
well when they adopted you

36:28.103 --> 36:29.689
and insulated you
in Darien, Connecticut

36:29.827 --> 36:31.620
and convinced you that
all that stuff was possible,

36:31.758 --> 36:32.896
but it's not.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.517
Life is messy and f'd up

36:34.655 --> 36:36.034
and you're gonna have a job

36:36.172 --> 36:37.689
where you have
to make complicated decisions.

36:38.275 --> 36:39.482
So I guess
what I'm trying to say

36:39.620 --> 36:41.000
is that you need
to grow the hell up.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.758
Gwen, I really don't wanna
lose our friendship.

36:47.103 --> 36:48.931
Go find yourself first, Vanessa.

36:49.413 --> 36:51.103
I can't be friends with a ghost.

36:59.137 --> 37:00.137
Jury's back.

37:00.275 --> 37:01.344
9AM tomorrow.

37:01.482 --> 37:02.827
That was fast.

37:03.034 --> 37:04.275
Is that good or bad?

37:04.413 --> 37:05.344
For who?

37:13.310 --> 37:15.413
Let the oppressor
be the oppressed.

37:16.034 --> 37:19.517
Will the system crumble
under weight of its own lives

37:19.655 --> 37:21.310
to come to its own deaths?

37:33.172 --> 37:34.965
They're not lookin' at me,
is that bad?

37:35.103 --> 37:36.172
I don't know.

37:37.379 --> 37:39.000
I understand you have a verdict?

37:55.275 --> 37:58.551
On count one,
murder in the first degree,

37:58.862 --> 38:00.793
we the jury find the defendant,

38:00.931 --> 38:03.724
Jackson Whitmore, not guilty.

38:04.655 --> 38:06.482
Order! Order!

38:07.068 --> 38:08.413
No more outcries!

38:10.000 --> 38:11.068
Please continue.

38:11.448 --> 38:14.275
On count two,
murder in the second degree,

38:14.655 --> 38:16.655
we the jury find the defendant,

38:16.827 --> 38:18.000
not guilty.

38:20.310 --> 38:21.448
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

38:21.586 --> 38:23.034
thank you for your service.

38:23.344 --> 38:24.586
We are adjourned.

38:25.103 --> 38:26.482
All rise.

38:28.551 --> 38:29.931
- I love you.
- It's over.

38:30.068 --> 38:32.310
For havin' my back,
thank you so much.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.172
Give the family
a little bit of room!

38:46.206 --> 38:47.586
Mr. Whitmore,
do you have any comments

38:47.724 --> 38:49.172
about today's verdict?

38:49.310 --> 38:50.724
We'd like to express
our gratitude and thank you

38:50.862 --> 38:52.068
to the jury and everyone
who supported our family.

38:52.206 --> 38:53.655
Thank you, thank you.

38:53.793 --> 38:55.034
Alright, guys, clear a path.

38:55.172 --> 38:56.724
Please, clear a path
for the family.

38:56.862 --> 38:58.620
Comin' through!

38:59.137 --> 39:01.896
- Comin' through!
- Thank you all so much!

39:14.793 --> 39:16.068
Tessa, Tessa, Tessa.

39:16.206 --> 39:17.310
You again?

39:17.517 --> 39:18.551
What do you want?

39:18.827 --> 39:20.379
You got a lot
of explaining to do.

39:20.517 --> 39:22.275
To me, to a whole lot
of people in the neighborhood.

39:22.413 --> 39:23.344
Get in.

39:23.551 --> 39:24.793
And if I don't?

39:24.965 --> 39:26.862
Then that complaint
with the bar proceeds.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.034
Get in!

39:37.413 --> 39:38.551
Brothers and sisters!

39:38.689 --> 39:39.827
We have defeated the system!

39:39.965 --> 39:41.275
Franklin, are you alright?

39:41.413 --> 39:43.586
You were victorious
against the oppressor!

39:43.724 --> 39:45.206
- Yes, I was, but are you okay?
- You beat them.

39:45.344 --> 39:47.275
But you still harbor
the stench of the oppressor.

39:47.413 --> 39:48.620
That's why you need--

39:48.758 --> 39:50.206
You sound like
you're off your meds,

39:50.344 --> 39:51.310
we've talked about this,
I'm gonna call your sister.

39:51.448 --> 39:52.517
Don't call my sister,

39:52.758 --> 39:53.724
I'm on my medication,

39:53.862 --> 39:55.172
I still know you're in danger.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.551
I think we should go.

39:56.689 --> 39:57.827
I'm not in any danger,
it's okay, Dad,

39:57.965 --> 39:59.344
I know him, he's Franklin.

39:59.482 --> 40:00.551
- I'm not in any danger.
- But he tried to attack--

40:00.689 --> 40:01.758
I'm gonna call your sister,

40:01.896 --> 40:02.793
- we're here to help you.
- No!

40:02.931 --> 40:04.103
No! I know who you are!

40:04.241 --> 40:05.241
Sir, sir, listen,
this is my daughter,

40:05.379 --> 40:06.827
we're gonna leave now, okay?

40:06.965 --> 40:09.103
I know what you are!
The oppressor's inside you!

40:09.241 --> 40:11.517
- No, Franklin.
- The system's taking your soul!

40:11.655 --> 40:13.379
That's why I went to jail!

40:13.655 --> 40:15.862
Oh my God! Dad!

40:16.000 --> 40:17.724
Put your hands in the air!

40:17.862 --> 40:18.586
Franklin!

40:18.724 --> 40:21.379
Daddy! Somebody help us!

40:21.931 --> 40:23.482
This oppressive system--

40:24.172 --> 40:26.689
Help! Call an ambulance!

40:28.034 --> 40:29.517
Cameras everywhere!

40:29.655 --> 40:33.241
Monitors! Every man,
woman, and child.

40:33.379 --> 40:35.034
This is America!

40:36.586 --> 40:38.172
Here's a look back
at In Contempt...

40:38.310 --> 40:40.620
My team and I are fighting
to save your communities.

40:40.758 --> 40:42.517
Then on behalf of my community,

40:42.655 --> 40:44.655
let me say that
we'd feel much better,

40:44.793 --> 40:47.482
if you showed up
with some actual evidence.

40:48.758 --> 40:50.103
My client just pled
guilty to a crime

40:50.241 --> 40:51.931
he didn't commit
'cause he couldn't afford bail.

40:52.068 --> 40:52.793
Get off of me!

40:53.551 --> 40:55.448
Does anyone care
about the law around here?

40:55.586 --> 40:57.275
You are supposed to care!

40:57.413 --> 40:59.965
We are not processing widgets
these are human beings!

41:00.103 --> 41:02.000
I mean why are we even
bothering with a trial at all

41:02.137 --> 41:05.034
why not just take him out back
and hang him from a tree?
