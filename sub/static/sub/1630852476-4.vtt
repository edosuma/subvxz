Gordon:<i> Previously</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:03.377
Let's go!

00:03.713 --> 00:06.213
Your main challenge for today
is devoted to Italy.

00:06.257 --> 00:10.509
The chef who creates the best
dish will keep their team safe
from elimination cook-off.

00:10.553 --> 00:13.387
And that dish was
the spaghetti and clams.

00:13.431 --> 00:16.223
- Congrats, jonathan.
- ♪ oh, my god

00:16.267 --> 00:18.434
richard: Gordon and nyesha,
you each have to pick one

00:18.477 --> 00:21.186
of your chefs to battle it out
in the elimination.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.980
I am not ready to go home.

00:23.024 --> 00:26.025
Richard: One brought
more flavor than the other.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.152
It's the pork stir fry by zach.

00:28.154 --> 00:30.070
Zach:
It's wake up call I needed.

00:30.114 --> 00:32.489
Richard: Roice, you will
not be the next level chef.

00:34.035 --> 00:37.369
Gordon: Tonight, we have chosen
the perfect ingredient

00:37.413 --> 00:39.580
for today's challenge-- poultry.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.082
I can't mess up a bird dish.

00:42.126 --> 00:45.794
The other kitchens
have already grabbed anything
that I could possibly use.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.129
I don't even know what I have.

00:47.465 --> 00:50.549
- You overcook poultry
and you are donezo.
- Dry as a bone.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.801
I'm worried that I may be
going into elimination today.

00:52.845 --> 00:56.055
My biggest concern is that
mistake could send me home.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.057
What are you trying to do?
Kill me?

00:58.100 --> 01:01.643
<i> ( music playing )</i>

01:16.243 --> 01:18.035
line up.

01:18.037 --> 01:19.453
How is everyone feeling today?

01:19.497 --> 01:21.371
All: Good.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.499
All of you, just think back
to why we chose you.

01:23.501 --> 01:27.086
We tasted that magic
and we fought for that dish.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.254
So remember what team
you're cooking for

01:29.298 --> 01:31.507
and why you're wearing
those aprons.

01:31.550 --> 01:32.508
All: Yes, chef.

01:33.344 --> 01:34.760
Ready for your next challenge?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.428
All: Yes, chef.

01:36.472 --> 01:39.431
Nyesha, richard, and myself have
chosen the perfect ingredient

01:39.475 --> 01:40.432
for today's challenge,

01:40.476 --> 01:42.142
something every single
one of you

01:42.144 --> 01:44.520
has worked with before.

01:45.731 --> 01:46.730
Poultry.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.190
- Chicken.
- Oh, chicken.

01:48.234 --> 01:49.983
Okay.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.361
That's a bird. I'm a bird.

01:52.404 --> 01:55.280
My twitch username
is literally triciaisabirdy.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.574
<i> I can't mess up a bird dish.</i>

01:57.576 --> 02:00.160
There are dozens
of different types of fowl

02:00.246 --> 02:03.247
that a next level chef should
be able to prepare perfectly.

02:03.249 --> 02:06.625
- Oh, so different types of...
- Oh, my god.

02:06.669 --> 02:08.168
Okay, team ramsay,

02:08.212 --> 02:10.462
grab a keycard,
head over to the elevator,

02:10.506 --> 02:13.465
and that will determine
what floor you're cooking on.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.968
Thank you. You grab it.
I don't want to touch it.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.178
- Me? I plead the fifth.
- Yeah.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.681
Good luck, team ramsay.
Hope you're in the basement.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.058
- No, we're not going to the--
- we're gonna get the dungeon.

02:23.060 --> 02:26.228
Don't say it!
I don't want the dungeon.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.397
Dungeon!

02:28.440 --> 02:30.023
I do not want
to see the basement.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.441
We're not gonna be
in the basement.

02:33.821 --> 02:38.157
- Open sesame. All right.
- Let's go. Let's look at it.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.159
- It's all right.
- Haven't been wrong yet.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.621
- Okay.
- Oh, my god,
it is a dungeon.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.748
Oh, wow.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.126
Why? Why?

02:49.170 --> 02:51.295
Is this a washing machine?
And is it on?

02:51.297 --> 02:54.631
- Oh, this the oven.
- Bottom level is pretty bad.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.383
Anyone know what this is for?

02:56.427 --> 02:58.218
That's for a mashed potato.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.262
What big-ass potatoes
are you mashing?

03:00.297 --> 03:01.430
When you cook
for hundreds of people,

03:01.473 --> 03:02.973
that's what
the ( bleep ) that is.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.641
If there's ever
a zombie apocalypse,

03:04.685 --> 03:06.476
I want that potato masher
so I could, like,

03:06.520 --> 03:09.188
whack the zombies
with it away from me.

03:09.231 --> 03:12.357
Not that I would survive
long enough in an apocalypse,
to be honest.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.692
What the--

03:22.369 --> 03:23.368
( cheering )

03:23.412 --> 03:26.496
- let's go!
- We get second pick.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.832
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.751
Those elevator doors open,
and we're on the second floor,

03:30.753 --> 03:32.044
and I am lit.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.004
- Hey, I have these!
- Mm-hmm. Me, too.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.422
- Yeah, I love these plates.
- Mm-hmm.

03:35.466 --> 03:38.425
<i> I feel very good about</i>
<i> the equipment that's in there.</i>

03:38.469 --> 03:40.594
<i> It's not the basement.</i>
<i> Everything works.</i>

03:43.390 --> 03:45.349
- No whammy!
- No whammy, no whammy,
no whammy!

03:45.392 --> 03:47.768
Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.145
- This is it.
- This is it for us.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.564
- Hey, hey!
- This is it.

03:52.608 --> 03:55.609
- I want that one.
I want that one.
- Hurry here.

03:55.653 --> 03:58.403
( squealing )

03:58.447 --> 04:00.989
I've never had the opportunity
to cook on the top level,

04:01.033 --> 04:02.741
<i> and I'm beyond excited.</i>

04:02.743 --> 04:05.452
<i> We still five members</i>
<i> of our team,</i>

04:05.454 --> 04:07.287
<i> and I think that</i>
<i> at least one of us</i>

04:07.331 --> 04:08.622
<i> is going to have</i>
<i> a star dish coming out</i>

04:08.624 --> 04:10.457
of that level of a kitchen.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.292
So excited!

04:16.465 --> 04:18.382
Okay, basement.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.259
Today I'm gonna push you.
We got this?

04:20.294 --> 04:21.551
All: Yes, chef.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.263
One thing I'm gonna bring
is some flavor, okay?

04:24.265 --> 04:26.473
- There he is!
- All right, chefs. All right,

04:26.475 --> 04:27.808
- there he is.
- What's up, team blais?

04:27.977 --> 04:31.353
- Thank you.
- Richard:<i> We're</i>
<i> team trailblaisers.</i>

04:31.397 --> 04:32.354
<i> We're innovative.</i>
<i> We're creative.</i>

04:32.439 --> 04:34.064
If my chefs
can elevate their dishes

04:34.108 --> 04:35.691
from the middle level,

04:35.734 --> 04:38.193
<i> we will keep</i>
<i> team trailblaisers</i>
<i> four strong.</i>

04:40.030 --> 04:42.155
- Hi, chef!
- Hi, team.
How are we feeling?

04:42.199 --> 04:46.159
- Spicy.
- My team has gone into
the elimination twice,

04:46.161 --> 04:48.495
<i> and I'm still standing here</i>
<i> strong with five.</i>

04:48.539 --> 04:52.457
-<i> I wanna keep it that way. </i>
- All: Team nyesha!

04:52.501 --> 04:54.951
- Nyesha's on top.
- ( groans )

04:54.962 --> 04:57.838
- she hasn't lost anybody yet.
- We're not gonna lose
anyone today, chef.

04:57.881 --> 05:01.133
- We need to get someone off
of chef nyesha's team.
- Here we go!

05:01.135 --> 05:03.168
- Here we go, guys.
First picks.
- We are ready!

05:03.170 --> 05:06.263
First picks, guys. Go!

05:06.307 --> 05:08.098
- Go, go, go, go.
- Go, go, go, go.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.599
We're on top.
Let's stay on top.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.185
Poultry sounds very simple
and benign,

05:12.187 --> 05:13.520
<i> but it could be anything</i>
<i> with wings--</i>

05:13.564 --> 05:18.233
odds and ends, organs,
really iron-dense, tough meats.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.568
- 20 seconds left.
- I need a pepper.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.987
I don't know what to do.
I'm panicking.

05:22.031 --> 05:24.281
Oh, what am I gonna cook
that's gonna wow?

05:24.325 --> 05:25.782
<i> None of this to me</i>
<i> is wow factor.</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:30.162
But then I see an ostrich loin.
It's a great protein.

05:30.164 --> 05:33.081
It's different than
every other protein up there,

05:33.125 --> 05:35.167
<i> and I'm gonna</i>
<i> make this amazing.</i>

05:35.169 --> 05:38.420
- Nyesha:
Four, three, two, one.
- Is there a fruit?

05:38.464 --> 05:41.131
Let's go, guys.
Grab what you need
while it's still here.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.092
Come on, guys. Nice.

05:44.127 --> 05:45.218
Good job. Good job. Good job.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.971
Hustle, hustle, hustle.
Good job.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.389
- Here we go.
- We got this, trailblaisers.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.267
- Go time. All right.
- Go, go, go, go!

05:53.645 --> 05:57.439
- ( muttering )
- they are grabbing
like no other.

05:57.483 --> 05:59.858
- Thanks.
- Grab your protein.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.819
- Hey, leave us some
ingredients, please!
- Oh, my god.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.530
Courtney:<i> I see these little</i>
<i> chicken looking things</i>

06:05.574 --> 06:06.740
<i> and I pick it up.</i>

06:06.742 --> 06:08.367
<i> Okay, I have quail.</i>

06:08.369 --> 06:10.994
I've never cooked quail before.
How do I go about this?

06:11.038 --> 06:14.289
Four, three, two, one.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.124
Last grab.
Anything else you need?

06:16.168 --> 06:18.043
Anything else you need?
You got it?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.711
Careful. All right,
back to your stations.

06:19.797 --> 06:21.630
Let's go.
Let's get organized.

06:21.715 --> 06:25.050
Here we go, guys. Go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

06:25.085 --> 06:26.009
Grab something.
Come on, tricia.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.677
I got the pigeon.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.221
Grab, grab, grab.
Come on.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.473
Oh, my gosh. You almost
made me drop my bird.

06:31.517 --> 06:35.185
- 15 seconds gone.
- Either someone on my team
or the other kitchens

06:35.270 --> 06:38.605
has already grabbed anything
that I could possibly use.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.440
<i> Like, this is the worst case</i>
<i> scenario right now.</i>

06:40.484 --> 06:45.320
Gordon:
Five, four, three, two, one.

06:45.364 --> 06:48.198
Watch out!
Quick, quick, quick!
Well done!

06:48.200 --> 06:49.366
Well done,
well done, well done.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.827
- Tricia, you got a pigeon!
- I did.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.704
- How did that pigeon
fly down here?
- I don't know, chef.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.415
- Girl, this is it!
- Thank you, chef.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.042
- I want
the best dish of the day.
- Yes, chef.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.919
You have the rolls-royce
of poultry.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.003
I don't even know what I have.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.756
- Gordon: What did you grab?
- It has nothing on it.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.634
- Chicken livers.
Chicken livers.
- Chicken livers. Okay.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.678
Chicken freaking livers.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.554
Okay.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.430
I've never cooked
with chicken livers,

07:11.807 --> 07:13.432
<i> I've never eaten</i>
<i> chicken livers,</i>

07:13.434 --> 07:16.601
and they're sitting
in a pool of blood. Yuck!

07:16.645 --> 07:18.562
( gagging )

07:18.605 --> 07:20.564
<i> I'm worried.</i>
<i> What am I gonna make?</i>

07:27.531 --> 07:30.365
Let's go.
Your 45 minutes start now.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.159
Good luck.
Let's go, guys.

07:32.161 --> 07:34.327
Richard and nyesha's chefs
are probably up there

07:34.371 --> 07:36.538
<i> sitting pretty with all their</i>
<i> beautiful poultry choices.</i>

07:36.582 --> 07:39.207
<i> I can't afford to lose</i>
<i> another chef right now,</i>

07:39.251 --> 07:41.293
<i> but I've got four</i>
<i> amazing chefs remaining,</i>

07:41.295 --> 07:43.545
<i> and I tell you now, I'm pretty</i>
<i> confident in their ability</i>

07:43.589 --> 07:46.047
<i> to make their dishes</i>
<i> the next level.</i>

07:46.049 --> 07:47.299
Right, kenny,
what'd you get?

07:47.301 --> 07:48.592
- Pheasant.
- Very little fat in that.

07:48.594 --> 07:52.387
Pheasant overcooks
within seconds, so be smart.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.014
Tell me, chicken livers,
did you want those?

07:54.016 --> 07:56.475
Nope. Not at all.
I said I wanted to push myself,

07:56.518 --> 07:58.393
and doing something
I've never done before
is definitely gonna do that.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.687
Good.
Well, they are definitely
gonna push you.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.314
<i> My name is devonnie.</i>

08:02.357 --> 08:04.357
<i> I'm a stay at home mom</i>
<i> and a home cook.</i>

08:04.401 --> 08:05.192
Hey.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.610
<i> I want to show other moms</i>

08:06.653 --> 08:08.528
<i> that it's not too late.</i>

08:08.530 --> 08:10.530
<i> Have your baby,</i>
<i> and then find your joy</i>
<i> and find your peace.</i>

08:10.574 --> 08:12.157
Look at that.

08:12.201 --> 08:13.742
<i> So many reasons why I'm here.</i>

08:13.785 --> 08:15.035
A quarter of million dollars?

08:15.078 --> 08:18.246
Like, I could start
my own culinary business.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.457
<i> I could actually</i>
<i> realize my dreams.</i>

08:20.501 --> 08:21.750
<i> They wouldn't</i>
<i> just live in my head.</i>

08:21.793 --> 08:23.043
Mmm.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.294
<i> I'm in it to win it,</i>

08:24.338 --> 08:26.087
<i> and I will make it</i>
<i> to the top.</i>

08:26.131 --> 08:27.839
( baby crying )

08:27.883 --> 08:30.875
all right, motherhood calls.

08:30.877 --> 08:32.260
Tell me about the dish.
Where are we going?

08:32.596 --> 08:35.013
I think I'm gonna do
some kind of rice dish,
so maybe a jambalaya.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.265
I'm gonna have the chicken
livers inside mixed in,

08:37.267 --> 08:39.351
but then I'm also
gonna fry some for texture
and put them on top.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.187
Nice. So we have to
incorporate some really good
flavor in there.

08:42.231 --> 08:45.273
Ooh, I'm shaking.
Shaking like a leaf!

08:45.317 --> 08:47.734
♪ shaking like a salt shaker

08:47.778 --> 08:50.195
so, I'm gonna make
an asian-inspired turkey breast.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.613
- Yeah? Okay, great.
- I'm also feeling

08:51.990 --> 08:55.075
that we could do
an asian spice dusted
chicharrón with the skin.

08:55.118 --> 08:58.078
- It's a winning dish
if you pull it off, okay?
- You think so?

08:58.121 --> 09:00.372
I mean, I wouldn't say it
if I didn't think it.

09:00.415 --> 09:03.542
Poultry can be tricky because
if you overcook poultry,

09:03.585 --> 09:06.086
it is dry as a bone,
and you are donezo.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.420
<i> There's no going back.</i>

09:07.464 --> 09:09.256
Okay.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.216
Sergio, are you familiar
with cornish game hen?

09:11.260 --> 09:12.467
- I am not. No, first time.
- Oh, first time?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.386
- First time.
-<i> This isn't chicken.</i>

09:14.429 --> 09:16.805
What this is is a cornish g--

09:16.807 --> 09:18.974
is a cornish gain-- a "gain."

09:19.017 --> 09:21.017
I don't know what it is.
I can't say it.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.060
( bleep ) this thing.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.019
Nyesha:
Tell me about your plan.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.438
We're gonna do
scalloped sweet potatoes.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.982
We're gonna do
a peppered beurre blanc.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.109
- Beautiful.
- And a roasted
garlic broccolini.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.320
I wanna diversify flavors
because that's just
always what I do.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.281
I live to do this.
I love it.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.118
<i> My name is sergio steele,</i>

09:38.412 --> 09:41.121
I run meal prep company,
and I'm 26 years old.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.165
<i> I did not go</i>
<i> to culinary school</i>

09:44.167 --> 09:46.251
<i> because I don't believe</i>
<i> in school.</i>

09:46.295 --> 09:47.877
<i> Go out there on the field,</i>
<i> learn it yourself,</i>

09:47.879 --> 09:50.338
<i>and you can turn that two years</i>
<i> into ten years of knowledge.</i>

09:50.382 --> 09:53.008
<i> I'm really happy</i>
<i> to be on team nyesha.</i>

09:53.051 --> 09:54.467
<i> She's someone</i>
<i> I could learn a lot from,</i>

09:54.511 --> 09:56.428
<i> not just in culinary,</i>
<i> but the way she holds herself.</i>

09:56.430 --> 09:57.679
<i> I really respect it.</i>

09:58.015 --> 10:01.182
<i> Going into this competition,</i>
<i> I'm the youngest person there,</i>

10:01.184 --> 10:03.518
and I'm gonna be there to
take all those older people

10:03.562 --> 10:05.520
and show them what
the young guns can do.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.190
Resting's gonna be
very important, right?

10:09.234 --> 10:10.317
- Absolutely.
- Don't wait to the very end.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.401
<i> At the end of the day,</i>

10:11.445 --> 10:12.694
I just wanna keep it
nice and moist,

10:12.738 --> 10:14.613
and, well,
cook it beautifully.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.489
What's the plan, angie?

10:16.533 --> 10:21.161
I'm gonna do a savory ostrich
tenderloin chicken broth.

10:21.204 --> 10:25.040
- Much experience with ostrich?
- Not a lot, but I have had it.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.208
I do understand that it is
a very lean meat.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.752
- Very lean meat. Absolutely.
- Yes.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.088
My goal is for the judges to
have something to talk about.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.465
"whoa! Ostrich."

10:33.508 --> 10:35.800
pushing these dishes
to be excellent, yes?

10:35.844 --> 10:37.093
All: Yes, chef.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.638
Nyesha: These guys
better be scared down there.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.182
Anybody of have flour?
I have flour. Idiot.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.060
Good. Right.

10:45.103 --> 10:49.522
We're 10 minutes in
with 35 minutes to go.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.317
There's something exciting about
being dumped in the basement.

10:52.361 --> 10:55.987
That level of creativity
is tenfold, agreed?

10:56.031 --> 10:57.280
All: Yes, chef.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.324
What the ( bleep )
is at the bottom of this?

10:59.368 --> 11:01.326
Dirty ( bleep ) pan. Great.

11:01.370 --> 11:04.412
- Reuel, tell me,
what did you grab?
- Protein, I got oysters.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.289
Now tell me what we're
gonna do with these oysters.

11:06.291 --> 11:11.086
I'm gonna do almost like a play
on korean fried chicken.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.004
A little bit heat,
a little bit of spice.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.131
<i> If you ever look</i>
<i> at a chicken thigh,</i>

11:15.133 --> 11:17.133
there's this little piece
that sticks out

11:17.135 --> 11:19.678
on the top bone
that joins on to the back.

11:19.721 --> 11:20.637
That's the oyster.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.765
<i> It's tender, it's juicy,</i>

11:23.809 --> 11:26.351
it's a primo cut.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.728
And the fact that it actually
went down to the basement?

11:28.772 --> 11:30.730
I was like, "yeah, they stupid
for leaving that on there."

11:30.732 --> 11:33.358
okay, pigeon, an absolute dream.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.069
The most expensive poultry
on that platform, and it ends
down in the basement.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.238
Let me tell you something.
There are pigeons
all over the bronx.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.740
I'm not looking to put any
of them on my stovetop, okay?

11:40.784 --> 11:42.951
I just picture, like,
the pigeons that are flying
around in the sky,

11:42.994 --> 11:45.995
and then they're
just on the plate with
their feathers like...

11:46.039 --> 11:49.082
- How are you gonna cook it?
- I'm gonna sear it,
just the breast, chef.

11:49.126 --> 11:52.001
- And the rest of the bones,
I'm gonna make a jus.
- Nice.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.587
I feel like chef ramsay
does believe in me.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.966
<i> I think I need to believe</i>
<i> in myself a lot more.</i>

11:58.009 --> 12:01.553
After every dish,
I've been that kid that's like,
"oh, I failed."

12:01.596 --> 12:04.305
and I know how good
you are on social media.

12:04.349 --> 12:07.434
- I know that.
But I need to see you now.
- Yes, chef.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.938
I'm tricia wang,
and I'm a social media chef.

12:11.982 --> 12:16.192
I primarily stream
on twitch, where I have
over 60,000 followers.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.654
I am going to make
a japanese breakfast
on stream today.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.034
<i> In college, I actually majored</i>
<i> in economics and accounting.</i>

12:25.069 --> 12:29.247
I moved to become
an investment manager,
but it wasn't my passion.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.751
I quit and decided to go
to culinary school.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.211
<i> My parents were kind of like,</i>
<i> "go have your fun,</i>

12:35.297 --> 12:38.131
<i> but come back and do something</i>
<i> productive with your life."</i>

12:40.010 --> 12:42.051
I want to win this competition

12:42.095 --> 12:44.137
<i>to prove to myself, my parents,</i>

12:44.181 --> 12:46.222
<i> chef ramsay, and my followers</i>

12:46.266 --> 12:49.309
that I made the right choice,
I am good enough.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.521
- Stand by for surprises.
- Oui, chef.

12:53.565 --> 12:57.525
- Just over
25 minutes left, guys.
- Heard, chef.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.069
You know what we're missing here
with all these poultry dishes?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.197
Beautiful greens.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.574
That platform is coming down.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.285
Oh, my gosh.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.413
<i> I forgot about the special</i>
<i> secret ingredient drop.</i>

13:10.457 --> 13:13.958
- I don't have a game plan.
- Nyesha: One basket of greens.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.794
What's gonna add
the most to your dish?

13:15.837 --> 13:17.879
- I need color. I need color.
- Make it make sense.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.131
- Color's important, yes,
but what's the flavor?
- Move, move, move, move.

13:20.133 --> 13:24.677
As the platform starts dropping,
I do look over and I see
a beautiful purple kale.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.430
Oh, purple kale! ( bleep )

13:27.474 --> 13:30.225
I get frisée.
This definitely sucks.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.310
<i> It doesn't really define</i>
<i> "next level chef."</i>

13:32.354 --> 13:35.271
please do not put me
in the position to send any
of my teammates home.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.315
Right now,
it's not looking so good for me.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.358
Yes, chef!

13:42.322 --> 13:44.239
Get what you need for your dish.
One basket of greens.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.449
Oh, purple kale. ( bleep )

13:46.451 --> 13:49.035
guys, listen. Everyone's
gotta run to the platform.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.286
You gotta grab one basket
of greens.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.455
- Good, god! For this?
- A whole basket?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.791
You get one variety,
but grab the whole basket.

13:54.835 --> 13:58.419
Three, two, one.
Last looks.

13:58.463 --> 14:01.589
- Aah!
- Oh, good call.
Glad you got it.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.508
Greens, all of you.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.594
Grab a basket of greens.

14:06.638 --> 14:07.595
Let's go!

14:07.639 --> 14:13.184
Five, four, three, two, one.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.269
And go!

14:14.312 --> 14:15.311
Reuel:<i> I need color.</i>

14:15.355 --> 14:16.980
<i>And that purple and green kale,</i>

14:17.023 --> 14:19.023
I was like, "yep, thank you."

14:19.067 --> 14:21.317
- what'd you get?
- Kale. It seems to be
my saving grace so far.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.111
- It needs cooking, that. Yeah?
- Yes.

14:23.154 --> 14:26.656
- It needs cooking.
- How you feeling?

14:26.741 --> 14:27.490
I saw that purple kale though.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.742
That was calling my name
last minute.

14:29.786 --> 14:30.910
I grabbed frisée.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.161
<i> I like to see it as a garnish.</i>

14:32.163 --> 14:33.329
I might do a vinaigrette.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.665
- Make a vinaigrette to toss--
- yes.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.209
- Okay, I just wanna
make sure I'm tracking.
- Yep, yep.

14:40.255 --> 14:43.381
- It is payoff.
- Richard: All right,
time's running out.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.426
Mariah, as usual, you got
29 things happening over here.

14:46.469 --> 14:50.889
- That's my personality.
- That's great.
It's my personality too.

14:50.932 --> 14:54.267
Mariah:<i> Growing up, I was</i>
<i> raised by a single mother.</i>

14:54.269 --> 14:58.438
My father was abusive,
and so my mother
moved us around a lot.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.024
<i> We lived in</i>
<i> homeless women's shelters.</i>

15:01.067 --> 15:03.151
<i> ♪ please let me find</i>
<i> my strength ♪</i>

15:03.194 --> 15:05.153
<i> ♪ please let me find my way </i>

15:05.155 --> 15:07.697
when I found the kitchen,
it was my safe place.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.532
<i> I guess food rescued me.</i>

15:09.576 --> 15:13.578
<i> It really helped</i>
<i> save me and directed</i>
<i> the course of my life.</i>

15:13.580 --> 15:16.956
I because a private chef
about two years ago,

15:17.000 --> 15:18.124
<i> and right now,</i>
<i> I particularly work</i>

15:18.209 --> 15:20.710
<i> for one client</i>
<i> in houston, texas.</i>

15:20.754 --> 15:24.255
I want to win "next level chef"
because I want to inspire

15:24.299 --> 15:26.299
<i> other women who look like me</i>

15:26.301 --> 15:29.135
<i> and came from places</i>
<i> that I came from.</i>

15:29.179 --> 15:31.179
<i> I know what I'm doing</i>
<i> in the kitchen,</i>

15:31.181 --> 15:32.680
and I am a force
to be reckoned with.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.060
- So you have your tostada.
- Uh-huh.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.645
You got the cheese
that's gonna go on top.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.564
- And I was gonna fry these,
make them crispy.
- Yep, done. That's it.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.274
I'm gonna go to mexico
with this. All right.

15:43.777 --> 15:48.196
All right, ae, you gotta go.
Okay, that's enough broccoli
for all of us to eat dinner.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.448
I'm making a peking duck
inspired dish.

15:50.492 --> 15:54.160
<i> I know I want</i>
<i> the skin to be crispy,</i>
<i> but I'm stressed out.</i>

15:54.204 --> 15:55.954
I wanna contribute
to my team, you know?

15:55.997 --> 15:57.997
Jonathan saved my ass
the other day,

15:58.041 --> 15:58.831
and I wanna save his today.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.959
So you're going
as close as you can get

16:01.002 --> 16:01.834
to a peking duck breast.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.170
- Yes, yes.
- Okay, so this is great.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.172
You're gonna serve it whole,
like, just one breast like that?

16:06.216 --> 16:09.342
- Yes. Thank you, thank you.
- This is all about cooking
the duck perfectly

16:09.344 --> 16:14.013
- and making a delicious sauce.
- Talk to me about your plan.

16:14.057 --> 16:17.392
I got some chicken
I'm putting into the sous vide.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.185
Yep.
What chicken do you have?

16:19.229 --> 16:21.771
- I got drumsticks.
- Why are we sous viding?

16:21.815 --> 16:24.524
I just want it nice and tender.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.150
This one's done.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.152
- So we have treviso.
- Yes, chef.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.656
- What's the plan?
- I'm gonna add that
to my salsa.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.449
I'm gonna keep it fresh today.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.993
<i> Once I put it all together,</i>

16:35.036 --> 16:36.995
I thought to myself,
"wow, this is bomb."

16:37.038 --> 16:38.579
if I open a restaurant
after this,

16:38.581 --> 16:41.290
I'm putting this on the menu.
Like, this is fire.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.710
Some amazing aromas coming out
of this kitchen, guys.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.503
We not playing no games today.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.714
Keep it going, guys.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.550
That's enough time
with that pasta. Cut it
with a knife, honestly.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.260
- It'll be so much cleaner.
- Heard, chef.

16:52.303 --> 16:54.429
Okay, stop what you're doing.
Check your pigeon.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.222
- Yes, chef.
- Pinch the breasts.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.558
Tricia:<i> I have a lot</i>
<i> of components to finish.</i>

16:58.601 --> 17:00.101
I still need to sauté
the hearts.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.561
I still need
to get my vegetables on.

17:01.563 --> 17:05.106
I want our food looking like
the top flight kitchen, yes?

17:05.150 --> 17:07.316
- All: Yes, chef.
-<i> I really want to do well,</i>

17:07.360 --> 17:10.570
which is hard when there's
so many different things
and, like, two stoves,

17:10.613 --> 17:12.196
and chef ramsay being like,
"what are you doing?"

17:12.240 --> 17:13.698
and I'm like,
"I don't know anymore, chef."

17:13.742 --> 17:14.866
- yes, chef.
- Bang, bang, bang.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.160
Remember that synchronization
of organization? Remember?

17:17.162 --> 17:19.287
Yes, chef. Yes, chef.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.123
Courtney:
How's everybody doing?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.082
Great.
How about you, courtney?

17:23.084 --> 17:24.083
- I'm doing fine.
- Excellent.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.420
Just waiting till
we get a few seconds closer

17:27.464 --> 17:29.047
to hit my spinach.

17:29.049 --> 17:32.133
<i> On the mid-round drop,</i>
<i> I grabbed spinach.</i>

17:32.177 --> 17:35.636
I'm just gonna sauté it quickly,
and I'm gonna rest my quail

17:35.638 --> 17:37.346
on top of it so that it has
a little height.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.807
Should I add just a little bit
of sour cream to my slaw?

17:39.809 --> 17:42.143
Great idea, 'cause usually
you'd add mayonnaise, right?

17:42.187 --> 17:43.519
Correct. I usually would.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.063
Okay, this dish
is coming together.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.481
- You're on fire right now.
- And my cilantro.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.149
Now keep going with everything
you're thinking about.

17:48.193 --> 17:51.110
Courtney was
the last draft pick,

17:51.154 --> 17:53.446
<i> but she's got</i>
<i> lots of potential.</i>

17:53.490 --> 17:55.698
Her percentage of improvement
is incredible.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.784
<i> I think that the quail dish</i>
<i> could be the dish</i>

17:57.786 --> 17:59.911
that saves trailblaisers
today, for sure.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.537
God, I am so anxious!
I cannot.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.413
Don't!
Stop. You got this.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.374
You know how to cook, girl.
Cook.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.628
How you feeling, chef?
Coming together?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.421
Feeling good.
I'm landing an airplane
right now, flying on in.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.632
- Make sure the color
is flavor, yes?
- Yes, chef.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.300
- I wanna eat
with my eyes first.
- Yes, chef.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.719
Two minutes left, guys.
Let's start plating.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.971
- Start plating.
- Oh, yeah, that's sexy
right there.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.515
- Less than two minutes.
- ( bleep )

18:20.558 --> 18:22.266
let's go, jonathan.
We're plating now, right?

18:22.268 --> 18:24.060
- Yes, we're plating.
- Okay, you gotta go.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.228
Tacos,
they're tougher to plate.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.063
- People think that's easy.
- Yes, chef.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.523
I love your
mise en place, mariah.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.776
45 seconds to go.
Kenny, you gotta move your ass.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.529
The platform is moving.

18:34.572 --> 18:37.156
Let's go, guys.
Quick, let's go. Let's go.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.075
- ( overlapping chatter )
- let's go.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.453
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

18:42.497 --> 18:44.747
- six, five...
- I'm here. I'm here.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.207
You're not! Get over there!

18:46.251 --> 18:49.168
- Right here, right here.
- Two, one, and go!

18:49.212 --> 18:51.379
- Go, go! Jeez!
- Let's go!

18:51.422 --> 18:54.298
- Kenny: It's on there.
I was wiping it, chef.
- Dude!

18:54.300 --> 18:56.217
Man, what are you
trying to do, kill me?

18:56.261 --> 18:58.845
15 seconds.
You only got 15 seconds.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.180
- I got--
I need to put my sauce.
- 15 seconds though!

19:01.224 --> 19:02.431
Let's go, courtney.
Let's go, jonathan.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.600
You're the furthest away
from the platform.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.520
Come on, you guys!
Come on, courtney,
put it on the platform!

19:07.564 --> 19:09.063
- Four...
- Come on.

19:09.107 --> 19:12.275
- ...Three, two, one.
- Put it on.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.235
There it is. Last looks.
Last looks! Last looks!

19:14.320 --> 19:17.989
- Get it up there, baby. Whoo!
- ( bleep )

19:18.032 --> 19:20.324
I forgot the feta. Damn it!

19:20.368 --> 19:22.618
Let's go, guys.
Platform's here.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.328
Platform's here, guys.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.455
- Oh, ( bleep ).
We are top level.
- Good job.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.083
Good job, good job.
Let's go, let's go.

19:29.127 --> 19:32.170
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

19:32.172 --> 19:34.714
- six, five, four...
- Sergio! Sergio!

19:34.757 --> 19:36.340
- Three, two...
- ( overlapping chatter )

19:36.384 --> 19:39.051
- sergio!
- Right here, right here,
right here, right here.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.636
Good teamwork.
Good teamwork right there.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.056
- Whew!
- Yes!

19:44.100 --> 19:46.142
They look like top level dishes
right there.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.352
- Next level dishes.
- Team nyesha dishes.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.437
All: Yes, yes.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.441
- One, two, three.
- All: Team nyesha!

19:53.484 --> 19:54.609
Look at me.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.069
The finesse is on each
and every one of your plates.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.821
Beautifully done.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.199
- What's wrong?
- Proud of myself, chef.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.533
You should be proud
of yourselves.

20:02.577 --> 20:03.743
You should be! Come on!

20:03.786 --> 20:04.994
Devonnie:
We're all proud of you.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.162
Tricia:
<i> This dish is very me.</i>

20:06.206 --> 20:07.622
It has an asian influence

20:07.665 --> 20:09.540
<i> with some creativity on there,</i>

20:09.584 --> 20:11.918
<i> a little bit of boldness,</i>
<i> a little bit of nervousness.</i>

20:11.961 --> 20:14.545
- One of these dishes
is gonna save this team.
- Gordon: Man!

20:14.589 --> 20:19.759
- Come on. Good girl.
- ( bleep )

20:19.802 --> 20:21.219
I think I forgot the feta.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.845
- You forgot the what?
- Feta.

20:22.889 --> 20:23.888
- Huh?
- The feta.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.223
- Oh, yeah, that'll--
- ( bleep )

20:25.642 --> 20:28.935
I needed that feta for that
extra little bit of salt
on my tostada.

20:28.937 --> 20:32.563
<i> That is such a huge mistake</i>
<i> because it could send me home.</i>

20:33.608 --> 20:34.607
Oh, gosh.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.525
Oh, my god.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.534
If anything,
I'm just upset with myself

20:45.578 --> 20:47.745
in not doing
what I know I should be doing,

20:47.789 --> 20:50.456
which is double check
to make sure I had
everything on the plate.

20:50.500 --> 20:55.544
My biggest concern is that
that feta cost me $250,000.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.547
- Yeah.
- What an incredible 45 minutes.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.424
All of you, well done.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.593
This is a very tough
challenge, poultry.

21:02.628 --> 21:06.639
And on top of that,
the infusion of the greens
from the mid-round drop

21:06.641 --> 21:09.141
to pair with it was not easy.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.269
- Shall we dig in?
- Let's do it.

21:11.312 --> 21:14.605
Let's start with the top floor,
the top flight kitchen.

21:16.025 --> 21:19.527
- We have an ostrich tenderloin.
- Ostrich.

21:19.529 --> 21:22.446
This looks like
something I'd eat in
the neighborhood bistro.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.573
It's got a homey
sort of feel to it.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.327
I love it.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.454
I'd run a mile away
from ostrich.

21:30.498 --> 21:33.457
I'd run faster than a ( bleep )
ostrich to get away from that,

21:33.501 --> 21:36.377
so whoever picked that
already tells me

21:36.379 --> 21:38.421
the bold tenacity
of what they're about.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.630
( bleep )

21:39.841 --> 21:42.091
devonnie:<i> I don't even know</i>
<i> how to cook that.</i>

21:42.093 --> 21:44.135
What temp do you aim for?
Is that a medium rare?

21:44.178 --> 21:47.471
<i> Whoever cooked this</i>
<i> is probably someone you</i>
<i> gotta watch out for too.</i>

21:47.515 --> 21:50.516
Here we have
a jamaican-inspired
chicken wing...

21:50.560 --> 21:53.227
- Wow.
- And we have a treviso salsa.

21:53.271 --> 21:56.355
I mean, that has to be
the most elevated chicken wing
in the country tonight, right?

21:56.399 --> 21:57.982
Absolutely.

21:58.026 --> 22:00.359
Amazing brininess and sweetness

22:00.361 --> 22:02.528
coming off the bacon
in the salsa as well.

22:02.572 --> 22:06.449
Uh, treviso,
do something more with those,
the ones you laid down.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.451
Hit it in the pan for 30 seconds
and sort of get a little bit

22:08.494 --> 22:09.368
of that bitterness out there.

22:09.412 --> 22:13.331
Next up, we have a drumstick.

22:13.333 --> 22:17.293
This person has sous vide'd
the drumsticks.

22:19.130 --> 22:22.006
I mean, for me, I'd worry less
about using the circulator

22:22.050 --> 22:23.758
and more about using salt.

22:23.801 --> 22:27.470
It's sort of a cajun-inspired
biscuits and gravy.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.472
It looks very rustic,
very homely.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.475
Ooh-la-la. Wow.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.101
- That's it, right?
- Yes, baby.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.478
We all know you want
an extra thousand likes

22:35.521 --> 22:38.564
on any social media platform,
you put an egg on it.

22:38.608 --> 22:39.732
Gordon: Yeah.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.195
- Oh, no.
- ( bleep )

22:44.197 --> 22:45.571
- is that burnt?
- Damn.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.448
I'm struggling
with burning things.

22:47.492 --> 22:50.326
That's not something
I've experienced since
I was 12 years old,

22:50.370 --> 22:52.036
and it's really throwing me
off my game.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.163
Here we have
the cornish game hen.

22:54.165 --> 22:57.166
- And frisée.
- Wow.

22:59.253 --> 23:00.586
The actual poultry
is a little bit tough,

23:00.588 --> 23:02.963
and the frisée salad,
it's, like, an afterthought.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.174
Nyesha:
<i> My team is better than this.</i>

23:05.218 --> 23:07.093
There's just not a lot of love

23:07.136 --> 23:09.512
that I see coming off
of these dishes here today.

23:09.597 --> 23:13.349
<i> All I can hope for</i>
<i> is the other teams</i>
<i> had a hard time themselves.</i>

23:13.393 --> 23:18.813
- Richard, middle floor? Wow.
- A ground turkey tostada.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.356
Gordon: Tostada.
What a smart move.

23:20.775 --> 23:24.193
Richard: That's one
of the best-looking tostadas
I've ever seen, for sure.

23:26.030 --> 23:29.240
- Something like a quesa fresca.
- A little saline.

23:29.283 --> 23:31.117
It just needs that acidity.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.493
Richard:
<i> Mariah's a star.</i>

23:32.537 --> 23:35.287
She's like a scientist
who cooks delicious food,

23:35.331 --> 23:37.456
<i> but feta makes things "betta,"</i>

23:37.500 --> 23:39.291
and that one mistake
might've cost us.

23:39.335 --> 23:43.170
The next chef here,
this is a bourbon

23:43.172 --> 23:45.047
and honey-glazed
spatchcock quail.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.675
- Wow.
- And then this
red cabbage slaw.

23:47.718 --> 23:50.386
Wow.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.014
Yeah, quail's delicious.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.724
Bourbon glaze,
absolutely spot on.

23:55.768 --> 23:56.976
It elevates the quail.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.352
Smart move
with the greens underneath.

23:58.396 --> 24:01.021
- Really smart.
- Good job.

24:01.065 --> 24:04.191
This is a turkey breast

24:04.193 --> 24:06.152
and a turkey skin chicharrón.

24:06.195 --> 24:09.238
Visually, that's slightly dry.

24:10.575 --> 24:14.952
Wow. Yeah, it's a shame.
It's as dry as a bone.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.412
Perfect for the desert.
What a shame.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.289
Jonathan:
<i> It really sucks to hear that.</i>

24:18.332 --> 24:20.583
Because after,
you know, kind of doing well

24:20.626 --> 24:21.750
in the first two challenges,

24:21.794 --> 24:23.919
<i> and having top dish last time,</i>

24:23.963 --> 24:26.088
I'm worried that I may be
going into elimination today.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.467
All right, this next dish
is a version

24:29.510 --> 24:32.595
of the classic
peking duck breast.

24:34.432 --> 24:37.141
Whoever cooked this dish
is one to watch.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.934
They've nailed the cook
on that duck.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.687
- Skin nice and crispy.
- Yeah.

24:41.731 --> 24:44.356
This right here is next level.

24:44.400 --> 24:48.152
It's crazy because I started off
so insecure about it,

24:48.196 --> 24:49.487
<i> and I really hope my dish</i>

24:49.530 --> 24:52.364
<i> saves us from going</i>
<i> to elimination today.</i>

24:52.408 --> 24:54.700
So, go, ae!

24:56.287 --> 24:58.162
- Right, shall we descend
down to the basement?
- Yes.

24:58.164 --> 25:02.124
Brace yourselves.
This was a message from heaven.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.127
Chicken oysters. I'm amazed
they came down to the basement.

25:05.129 --> 25:08.214
I mean, listen,
who doesn't love chicken nuggets
and sweet and sour sauce?

25:08.257 --> 25:11.800
- That is not a chicken nugget.
- But this is-- this is like--

25:11.802 --> 25:15.304
- don't you embarrass my team.
- This is an elevated--

25:15.348 --> 25:16.764
that is not a ( bleep ) nugget.

25:16.807 --> 25:20.392
My man said "chicken nuggets."
mad disrespectful.

25:23.314 --> 25:24.271
Say what you want, gordon.

25:24.315 --> 25:25.981
The riff off of chicken nuggets

25:26.067 --> 25:27.858
and sweet and sour sauce
makes this work.

25:27.902 --> 25:32.029
- For me, it's tasty.
- It's fricking good dish,
that's what it is.

25:32.073 --> 25:35.241
Next, pheasant.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.493
Yeah, I mean, pheasant
would've been my last pick.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.954
It could be just really,
really tough to work with

25:39.956 --> 25:42.456
- and tough to eat,
quite honestly.
- Nyesha: Very difficult.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.250
This is definitely
next level cooking,

25:44.293 --> 25:46.502
but the sauce, it's having
a little bit of trouble

25:46.546 --> 25:49.088
getting into the pasta itself
and becoming cohesive.

25:49.131 --> 25:53.509
Right, this next dish,
a chicken liver jambalaya.

25:56.806 --> 25:59.139
- Wow.
- That's the money shot.

26:00.268 --> 26:02.184
- Money shot.
- Wow, I mean, I love

26:02.270 --> 26:04.186
how you get
the chicken liver flavor

26:04.230 --> 26:05.980
that's running through
this rice dish.

26:06.023 --> 26:09.275
Maybe a little bit more spice,
but I'm happy with this dish.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.360
It's the kind of food
I grew up with.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.946
I just wish my mum
was here to taste it.

26:15.366 --> 26:19.994
Ahh, I'm so proud of myself
because I cook with love.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.787
That's my secret weapon.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.415
And our final protein,

26:24.500 --> 26:27.001
I'm amazed this pigeon
flew down to the basement.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.335
It's a welcome surprise.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.588
Richard: This would've been
my favorite pick.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.006
I would've went for the pigeon
right off the bat.

26:32.008 --> 26:33.632
- Nyesha: Gorgeous.
- Yeah.

26:33.676 --> 26:36.093
- Mmm.
- Spot on.

26:40.016 --> 26:43.475
For me,
I would cook the carrot
just a touch more.

26:43.477 --> 26:47.479
Other than that,
really beautiful.

26:47.523 --> 26:50.149
There's a lot of components
going on in this dish.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.485
Sometimes when you
over-articulate a dish,
you trip up,

26:53.529 --> 26:58.282
but I think this is
this person's best performance.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.662
Give us a few minutes, please.
This is gonna be a tough one.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.039
Nyesha, richard, please.

27:05.041 --> 27:08.167
<i>My team is cooking brilliantly,</i>

27:08.210 --> 27:09.585
and they're making my job
really easy

27:09.629 --> 27:11.629
<i> because I've got</i>
<i> four outstanding dishes</i>

27:11.672 --> 27:14.214
that equally sit
at the very, very top.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.258
I'm stuck between a rock
and a hard place,

27:16.302 --> 27:17.259
but I think
the most cohesive dish

27:17.553 --> 27:21.180
that had the most effort
across the board, um,

27:21.223 --> 27:22.389
has to be that pigeon.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.435
- Let's be honest. The carrots
were a little undercooked.
- Only--

27:26.479 --> 27:28.729
the gochujang's
a little overpowering perhaps.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.522
- A little bit.
- Do you think so?

27:30.566 --> 27:33.317
It's a great story.
Is it the tastiest dish?

27:33.361 --> 27:35.527
- Go on.
- I think it's the duck.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.237
<i> I've tasted</i>
<i> all of these dishes too.</i>

27:37.281 --> 27:40.032
I think team blais has
the best dish in the house.

27:40.034 --> 27:41.408
I think the duck
was a close second for me.

27:41.452 --> 27:44.119
The duck, I love how clean
the presentation was.

27:44.163 --> 27:48.707
- It's beautiful.
- The duck is an amazing dish,
but I just feel the pigeon,

27:48.751 --> 27:51.460
it's just edging it
in terms of the detail.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.337
Also the gumption
to pick pigeon.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.130
Not an easy protein to cook.

27:55.132 --> 27:59.218
I can't lose another chef.
I can't be down to three people.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.969
Okay, sounds like
we decided, yeah?

28:01.013 --> 28:02.513
- Okay.
- We good?

28:02.556 --> 28:07.142
- All right, you guys.
- Oh, my heart is
beating so fast.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.396
Nyesha:<i> There's no doubt</i>
<i> in my mind that richard</i>
<i> and gordon are torn.</i>

28:10.439 --> 28:13.107
<i> This decision</i>
<i> is coming down to me,</i>

28:13.150 --> 28:14.566
but one dish is
absolutely standing out

28:14.568 --> 28:17.277
to be the most
delicious-looking dish tonight.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.740
Chefs, there are two dishes here

28:21.742 --> 28:26.245
that stood out amongst all
that we're looking at today.

28:28.290 --> 28:32.710
The squab dish
and the duck breast.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.378
Thank you.

28:34.422 --> 28:40.217
The person that's won safety
for their team

28:40.261 --> 28:42.219
was the chef that cooked...

28:46.851 --> 28:50.144
- The squab.
- Hold your head up.
Hold your head up.

28:50.187 --> 28:53.063
We told you, baby.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.107
Gordon:
Tricia, we were stuck tonight.

28:55.151 --> 28:57.276
So many good dishes all around,
but this is on another level.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.069
- Thank you, chef.
- Congratulations.

28:59.113 --> 29:00.571
Finally, I'm number one.

29:00.614 --> 29:03.115
<i> I'm gonna start believing</i>
<i> in myself more.</i>

29:03.117 --> 29:05.701
Instead of saying things like,
"I wanna be top ten,"

29:05.745 --> 29:07.369
"I don't want to go home first,"

29:07.455 --> 29:11.457
I'm gonna say, "I wanna win."
I wanna win this competition.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.917
So, nyesha,
you now have to select

29:13.961 --> 29:15.335
one individual from your team

29:15.379 --> 29:18.881
to go alongside
richard's individual

29:18.883 --> 29:20.215
in the elimination challenge.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.676
I'm fine with richard
and nyesha's chefs

29:22.720 --> 29:24.261
knocking each other's out.

29:24.305 --> 29:25.471
That just makes
my team stronger.

29:25.473 --> 29:26.638
Richard?

29:26.974 --> 29:28.557
You know, there's a couple
of choices for me, team blais,

29:28.601 --> 29:32.060
but I'm gonna send one of you
that has been rising

29:32.104 --> 29:34.188
each time we cook and
is getting better and better.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.565
So I'm sending this chef
into elimination

29:36.567 --> 29:38.567
because I believe
they can win the elimination.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.402
Not the weakest performing dish?

29:40.446 --> 29:42.321
Richard: No, not
the weakest performing dish.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.990
I'm sending the chef
that I think can win

29:45.034 --> 29:47.367
the elimination for team blais.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.578
There's no doubt
this could be a risky choice,

29:49.580 --> 29:53.707
<i> but I'm sending this chef in</i>
<i> because I know they can win.</i>

29:53.751 --> 29:55.125
<i> We had four chefs to start,</i>

29:55.127 --> 29:57.461
and we're gonna finish
with four chefs today.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.463
I'm sending in...

30:07.431 --> 30:09.598
- Richard?
- I'm sending in...

30:14.480 --> 30:16.230
Courtney.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.651
You've been getting better
and better each and every cook.

30:22.488 --> 30:23.904
- Thank you.
- You've been thinking quick,

30:23.948 --> 30:26.156
you've been moving quick,
and your flavors are there.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.116
Don't doubt yourself.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.952
Courtney:<i> I'm speechless.</i>
<i> I'm shocked.</i>

30:29.995 --> 30:33.539
I think it's amazing that
he has that confidence in me,

30:33.582 --> 30:37.292
<i> but in reality,</i>
<i> anybody from my team</i>
<i> could have been here.</i>

30:37.294 --> 30:40.587
Nyesha, you now have to select
one individual from your team

30:40.631 --> 30:44.091
to go alongside courtney.

30:45.636 --> 30:47.261
Yes, well, um...

30:47.304 --> 30:50.514
<i> My team didn't perform</i>
<i> that great today,</i>

30:50.516 --> 30:53.058
but I know who I want
to put up for elimination.

30:53.060 --> 30:56.186
I need this chef to prove

30:56.230 --> 30:59.398
that they can handle pressure.

30:59.441 --> 31:04.069
The chef that I'm choosing
to cook tonight

31:04.071 --> 31:05.612
is going to be sergio.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.156
I know you're better than this.

31:08.158 --> 31:09.783
Prove to me
why you're here, sergio.

31:09.827 --> 31:12.286
- I know you can do it.
- I will, chef.

31:12.329 --> 31:15.414
I am disappointed.
I'm not here to overcook
proteins, and I did that.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.541
<i> But ready to put in the work.</i>

31:17.585 --> 31:18.542
Not ready to go home yet.

31:18.586 --> 31:20.085
Come on. You got it.

31:20.129 --> 31:23.589
Courtney, sergio,
say goodbye to your teams.

31:23.632 --> 31:27.342
Everybody else,
head to elevator.
I'll see you on the top floor.

31:28.971 --> 31:31.680
- You ain't going nowhere.
Don't worry.
- Good luck, courtney.

31:31.682 --> 31:33.765
I'm just gonna
have to bring it, period.

31:33.767 --> 31:34.892
So listen carefully.

31:35.185 --> 31:39.021
You'll each get one beautiful
supreme chicken breast.

31:39.064 --> 31:42.774
And you know what?
I'm gonna include one more
ingredient on there

31:42.818 --> 31:45.277
to really elevate those dishes
and take them to the next level.

31:45.279 --> 31:48.488
Only happens once a year.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.075
The perigord truffle.

31:52.119 --> 31:55.287
Chicken and truffle
is the perfect dish.

31:55.331 --> 31:58.290
I have seen some of
the richest people in the world

31:58.334 --> 32:00.751
talk about
how amazing truffles are.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.503
<i> But I've never worked</i>
<i> with truffles before,</i>

32:03.547 --> 32:06.173
so I'm definitely going to need
to figure it out very quickly.

32:06.216 --> 32:11.428
Do yourselves proud,
do your mentors even prouder,
and stay in the competition.

32:11.472 --> 32:15.223
- Yes, chef.
- Richard and nyesha
will join us

32:15.267 --> 32:17.434
after you finish cooking.

32:17.478 --> 32:20.646
They will taste blindly,
then decide whose dish is best.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.397
Okay, both of you,
head to the elevator.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.358
I'll see you
in the top kitchen shortly.
Good luck.

32:24.401 --> 32:26.234
- Let's go.
- You got this, courtney.

32:28.614 --> 32:33.325
Sergio is a professional chef,
but I'm not down.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.535
I know I can cook.
May the best chef win.

32:37.998 --> 32:41.041
- Hey, let's go, sergio.
- There we are!

32:41.085 --> 32:42.167
Sergio:
<i> Everything is on the line.</i>

32:42.169 --> 32:44.002
Pressure cooking
around the stress

32:44.046 --> 32:44.920
is what I've always done.

32:45.172 --> 32:47.297
It's how I became a chef
at the age of 18.

32:47.341 --> 32:50.050
Numerous french, italian,
fine dining establishments,

32:50.094 --> 32:51.510
<i> and we're talking truffle?</i>

32:51.553 --> 32:53.387
I know it like
the back of my hand.

32:53.389 --> 32:55.347
Team steele!

32:55.391 --> 32:58.392
Which way is victory?
That way.

32:58.435 --> 32:59.768
This is what I was born to do.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.478
This is, like,
where I really shine.

33:01.522 --> 33:03.230
- Let's go.
- I'm gonna put some

33:03.273 --> 33:05.190
michelin star ( bleep )
on that plate.

33:07.111 --> 33:08.568
Right, how are we feeling?

33:08.570 --> 33:11.113
- Courtney, sergio, we good?
- We are good, chef.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.447
- Yes. Yes, chef.
- One super talented home cook

33:12.491 --> 33:15.117
versus one very talented
professional cook.

33:15.119 --> 33:18.620
- Yes, chef.
- Right, when that platform
drops, we got 30 minutes.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.330
Chicken with truffle.

33:20.374 --> 33:23.250
Both of you, please,
on your stations.

33:23.293 --> 33:25.085
- Let's do this, sergio.
- Y'all got this.

33:25.129 --> 33:27.295
Let's go, courtney!
You got this.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.257
Gordon: The platform
will come down shortly.
We're about to go.

33:30.259 --> 33:35.721
As that comes down,
your 30 minutes start now.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.222
Go, guys! We're live!
Let's go.

33:37.266 --> 33:39.558
There we go.
Chicken breast.

33:39.601 --> 33:40.976
Good. Think about it.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.228
Asparagus over here,
beautiful trumpet mushrooms.

33:43.272 --> 33:47.649
Plenty time.
You can come back here as many
times as you like, okay?

33:47.651 --> 33:49.901
- So, focus.
- Yes, chef.

33:49.945 --> 33:53.447
- Let's go.
- Asparagus, and there's
some corn if you want.

33:53.449 --> 33:54.439
Corn. Good.

33:54.658 --> 33:56.116
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

33:56.160 --> 33:59.453
So I'm gonna do a mushroom
truffle cream sauce.

33:59.496 --> 34:00.620
Nice. Love that idea.

34:00.914 --> 34:04.332
- And pan sear this,
put it in the oven.
- Good.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.917
- Crispy skin.
Skin side down.
- Uh-huh.

34:05.961 --> 34:09.254
- Lots of baste in there, okay?
- Yeah. I cook a lot of chicken.

34:09.298 --> 34:11.089
I'm not afraid
of cooking chicken.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.424
<i> But truffles, I don't know</i>
<i> what it tastes like.</i>

34:12.468 --> 34:13.967
<i> I don't know how much</i>
<i> I'm supposed to be using.</i>

34:14.261 --> 34:16.553
- What do I do next?
- And truffle, are you going
to chop the truffle?

34:16.555 --> 34:19.598
- Grate the truffle in there?
Where are you going?
- Um...

34:23.270 --> 34:26.438
- Yeah, it'll be grated.
- Good. Right, sergio.

34:26.482 --> 34:28.398
- Yes, chef?
- Tell me, how we feeling?
Where are we going?

34:28.442 --> 34:30.442
Definitely gonna get
some leeks in there.

34:30.486 --> 34:32.444
We're gonna do some sort
of potato purée.

34:32.488 --> 34:34.446
We're gonna do a nice little
french style chicken.

34:34.490 --> 34:36.239
You putting the truffle
in the mash?

34:36.283 --> 34:37.866
- Yes. Yes, chef.
- Or the truffle with the leeks?

34:37.951 --> 34:40.994
A little bit inside of it,
and then outside as well
for garnish.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.538
Good. Sounds delicious.
Sage, be super careful.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.248
- Powerful herb.
- Very potent. Very potent.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.042
Very, very, very powerful.

34:47.086 --> 34:49.169
With chicken, sage,
if you're gonna use it,

34:49.171 --> 34:51.088
- then be sparing.
- Absolutely.

34:51.131 --> 34:52.589
- Really sparingly, yes?
- Yes, chef.

34:52.633 --> 34:55.050
Good luck. 25 minutes to go.

34:55.052 --> 34:57.135
There you go.
Straight in there.

34:57.179 --> 34:59.596
- Top shelf.
- Rotate that corn.

35:01.433 --> 35:05.060
- Top shelf, right?
- Your dish, courtney.
Your dish.

35:05.062 --> 35:07.020
Sergio, this is a cheat meal.

35:07.064 --> 35:08.605
This is gonna be
all butter and cream.

35:08.649 --> 35:09.648
Cheat meal, all butter.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.274
Sergio, did you poke
your chicken?

35:11.276 --> 35:13.235
- Is your chicken to temp?
- Chicken's good.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.278
Test the temperature
just in case though.

35:15.322 --> 35:17.072
You never-- just in case.

35:17.074 --> 35:20.534
When you're competing
for 30 minutes head-to-head,
it's difficult.

35:20.577 --> 35:21.368
<i> It's stressful.</i>

35:21.411 --> 35:22.744
Should I cut protein or no?

35:22.788 --> 35:24.287
No, dude, that's a beautiful
breast right there, man.

35:24.331 --> 35:27.624
Watch that flame
in front of you.
Be careful, be careful.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.167
It can burn me.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.461
You have to have thick skin
to just not get drowned

35:31.505 --> 35:34.047
in voices coming
from every direction.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.173
He is so calm.

35:35.217 --> 35:38.009
12 minutes to go, guys.
Yes? Just over.

35:38.053 --> 35:41.179
- Just over 12 minutes to go.
- Get some truffle! Truffle!

35:41.181 --> 35:43.390
- Potatoes.
- Truffle.

35:43.433 --> 35:46.518
- You're good.
- That's good. That's good.

35:46.562 --> 35:48.395
- Salt?
- She already got salt.
She already got salt.

35:48.438 --> 35:50.397
- You got salt?
- ( overlapping chatter )

35:50.440 --> 35:53.650
I've definitely cooked
within a particular timeframe.

35:53.694 --> 35:56.403
- Okay, now asparagus.
- Just throw that
bitch in there.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.780
- ( sighs )
- but not with a whole
bunch of people

35:58.782 --> 36:00.198
saying stuff to me either.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.533
- A little squeeze of lemon.
- Toss it around.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.243
Add some more butter
if you need to.

36:03.287 --> 36:06.079
- No rosemary.
Just put it in there.
- Salt, toss.

36:06.123 --> 36:07.372
Please, guys.
All of you, quiet.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.333
Courtney:<i> I need some help,</i>
<i> but this is not helpful.</i>

36:10.335 --> 36:13.753
- It's really intense.
- Look at me. Look at me.

36:13.797 --> 36:15.046
- Look at me.
- Yes, sir.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.256
They're not cooking.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.258
Back up one foot,
please, all of you.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.467
Shut it down now and focus.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.637
Oh, my god. I can't--
I can't breathe.

36:30.022 --> 36:32.939
You're looking confused.
Hey, I know this is tough,

36:32.983 --> 36:35.025
but I've seen what you've done
so far in this competition.

36:35.068 --> 36:37.360
You are more than capable
of doing this, okay?

36:37.404 --> 36:39.487
Big, deep breath,
shut it down now, and focus.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.324
- You okay?
I'm here for you, okay?
- Yeah.

36:42.326 --> 36:45.243
Personally, I feel it's
too close to call right now,

36:45.287 --> 36:47.913
<i> but courtney needs</i>
<i> to take ownership of her dish</i>

36:47.956 --> 36:50.290
<i> if she's gonna</i>
<i> have any shot of remaining</i>
<i> in the competition.</i>

36:50.334 --> 36:52.250
- You got this.
- You got this.

36:52.294 --> 36:55.045
Just breathe.
Inhale, exhale.
You got this.

36:55.088 --> 36:57.464
Once I was able
to just take a few breaths...

36:58.717 --> 37:01.218
- Salt. I see the lemon.
- Lemon.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.761
Talk to myself a minute,

37:02.763 --> 37:04.221
<i> say, "you got this."</i>

37:04.264 --> 37:05.222
good.

37:05.265 --> 37:06.348
"it's your race to win or lose."

37:06.391 --> 37:09.392
- gordon: Six minutes to go.
- Oh, man.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.436
So back in the pan,
get them nice and dry again.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.396
- That'll create
the perfect match.
- Yep.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.981
Using the ricer?
How are you using them?

37:15.025 --> 37:18.235
- I'm gonna purée it in there.
- Be careful.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.904
One thing I know
about working with potatoes

37:20.948 --> 37:22.197
is they can release
too much starch.

37:22.491 --> 37:26.409
<i> And putting them a blender</i>
<i> is a very risky game to play.</i>

37:26.453 --> 37:28.203
Use that truffle now.
Use that truffle.

37:28.247 --> 37:31.081
- All right, yeah.
- Lock it in now.
Focus on that, yes?

37:31.124 --> 37:35.085
- Final two minutes.
- All right, serge.

37:35.128 --> 37:36.878
- Let's go.
- Get that-- oh, yeah!

37:36.922 --> 37:38.129
- Oh, yeah!
- Don't forget your oil, serge.

37:38.465 --> 37:40.423
- Courtney! Gorgeous.
Courtney, gorgeous.
- Oh, yeah!

37:40.467 --> 37:43.093
20 seconds to go!
Come on, guys!

37:43.136 --> 37:45.878
That's it, that's it.
That's it, that's it.

37:45.880 --> 37:50.475
- Yeah, sergio.
You've got this.
- Ten, nine, eight,

37:50.477 --> 37:53.728
seven, six, five,

37:53.772 --> 37:57.482
four, three, two, one.

37:57.526 --> 37:59.359
- Stop! Well done.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.403
You, ma'am.

38:06.368 --> 38:08.326
Our judges are here. I don't
want them to hear anything.

38:08.328 --> 38:13.164
Remember, you can't relay
who cooked what dish.

38:14.209 --> 38:18.044
- Nyesha, richard.
- Chef.

38:18.088 --> 38:20.130
This one was intense.

38:20.132 --> 38:22.590
The first dish,
it's a sautéed fingerling,

38:22.634 --> 38:25.468
sautéed asparagus,
and a mushroom truffle
cream sauce.

38:25.512 --> 38:30.348
And this dish,
this is done with a super fine
truffle mashed purée

38:30.350 --> 38:31.474
done with some chive oil

38:31.727 --> 38:34.686
finished with a little touch
of crispy sage on top.

38:34.730 --> 38:36.479
Let's start off with this one.

38:36.523 --> 38:40.317
I'm excited to taste
what this dish is throwing down.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.194
Two great chefs
were cooking tonight.

38:43.196 --> 38:45.447
<i> One of us is going home.</i>

38:45.490 --> 38:48.325
I'm just praying. I mean,
I'm literally just praying.

38:48.368 --> 38:51.536
Mushrooms are lacking
a little bit of seasoning,

38:51.580 --> 38:53.788
but the sauce
is extremely velvety.

38:53.832 --> 38:58.418
The chicken is cooked spot on,
but I want more truffle.

38:58.462 --> 39:00.754
There's so much perfume
in a truffle,

39:00.756 --> 39:02.297
want a little bit more
of that flavor.

39:02.632 --> 39:07.302
- So, the next one.
- Next one. The chicken
looks absolutely gorgeous.

39:07.346 --> 39:09.220
Interesting choice to use sage.

39:09.264 --> 39:12.515
It sometimes can be
a little bit strong.

39:12.559 --> 39:15.560
I think my dish
definitely has the potential
to be a winner.

39:15.604 --> 39:17.270
Richard: Don't like
visually on this plate

39:17.314 --> 39:19.647
how it looks like all
the pan juices from the chicken

39:19.691 --> 39:21.274
ended up on the plate.

39:21.318 --> 39:23.318
If I mess up a chicken breast,
then send me home.

39:23.362 --> 39:27.489
The texture on the purée...

39:29.659 --> 39:31.159
A little gummy.

39:31.161 --> 39:32.702
It sort of interferes
with a little bit

39:32.746 --> 39:34.120
of that truffle flavor.

39:34.164 --> 39:36.539
- The cook on the chicken.
- Phenomenal.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.042
Okay, amazing feedback.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.293
Two extraordinary dishes.

39:40.337 --> 39:42.295
Nyesha,
I'm gonna start with you.

39:42.297 --> 39:45.423
The dish that
is less appealing for me...

39:49.054 --> 39:52.055
...Is the chicken
with potato purée.

39:52.099 --> 39:54.349
Sergio, if this is your dish,

39:54.393 --> 39:55.642
and you put
those two ingredients,

39:55.685 --> 39:57.310
sage and truffles together,

39:57.354 --> 39:59.354
<i> this is going to</i>
<i> truly upset me.</i>

39:59.398 --> 40:01.564
Richard,
I've tasted both dishes.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.358
If it goes to a tie,
I'll split that tie,

40:03.402 --> 40:05.527
but your least favorite dish?

40:05.570 --> 40:07.237
Tough decision.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.656
And I have to say, nyesha,

40:09.699 --> 40:11.408
you are spot on

40:11.451 --> 40:13.326
most of the time,
but I disagree with you.

40:13.328 --> 40:16.746
My least favorite dish,
the chicken with asparagus.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.166
The chicken and asparagus dish,

40:20.168 --> 40:21.584
to me, it just does not
have enough truffle.

40:21.628 --> 40:25.171
<i> When you use truffle,</i>
<i> you want to taste truffle.</i>

40:25.215 --> 40:26.756
I hope it's sergio's dish.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.466
Gordon,
I guess it's up to you.

40:33.265 --> 40:35.807
This is tough. I'm sorry.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.060
The least favorite dish
for me...

40:39.104 --> 40:41.229
I can't watch this.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.730
...Was the chicken and the sage.

40:42.732 --> 40:45.400
Sergio.

40:45.444 --> 40:48.236
Young man,
I'm gonna explain something
really important to you.

40:48.280 --> 40:51.489
Never ever, ever
put mashed potato in
an electric mixer.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.158
It turned it gummy.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.285
But the big issue for me
was the sage.

40:55.328 --> 40:57.120
And the minute
you put that on there,

40:57.164 --> 41:01.124
I warned you
the pungent strength
is way overpowering,

41:01.168 --> 41:03.293
and the hero tonight
was the chicken and the truffle.

41:03.295 --> 41:06.337
Unfortunately, you put sage
in front of the truffle.

41:06.381 --> 41:07.547
Therefore,
it's time to go home.

41:07.591 --> 41:09.132
Thank you
for the opportunity, chefs.

41:09.176 --> 41:11.593
I do appreciate it.
It's been a pleasure.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.344
- Good luck to you.
- It has been a pleasure.
Thank you.

41:13.388 --> 41:15.847
I was proud of the dish.
I was 100% proud of the dish.

41:15.891 --> 41:17.432
<i> I don't think the sage</i>
<i> was overpowering.</i>

41:17.767 --> 41:20.310
I think you're getting
a whole 'nother bite of
a different flavor profile.

41:20.312 --> 41:23.396
- Gordon:
Good night, sergio.
- Good night.

41:23.398 --> 41:26.065
But that's not the end
of chef sergio steele.

41:27.569 --> 41:30.487
It's coming down to details,
and that's how small a detail

41:30.530 --> 41:32.405
got somebody sent home
this evening.

41:32.449 --> 41:34.657
But I would like to say
bloody well done to courtney.

41:34.701 --> 41:37.285
Thank you.

41:37.287 --> 41:39.537
I impress me.
I'm proud of me.

41:39.623 --> 41:44.584
<i> From being picked last,</i>
<i> I have grown tremendously.</i>

41:44.628 --> 41:48.505
Courtney, I didn't put you
up here today because you had
the worst dish on our team.

41:48.548 --> 41:50.590
I knew that you would learn
even more from this experience.

41:50.592 --> 41:51.758
I appreciate it.

41:52.010 --> 41:57.013
I was able to show myself
that you deserve to be here.

41:57.015 --> 42:01.017
We're always trying
every step of the way

42:01.061 --> 42:03.019
and at every level
to inspire you.

42:03.063 --> 42:06.231
But what I'm seeing
is you need something more

42:06.274 --> 42:09.484
- than just words
to inspire you.
- Oh, gosh.

42:09.528 --> 42:14.531
- What?
- So before our next challenge,

42:14.574 --> 42:18.701
all of us
will be heading somewhere

42:18.745 --> 42:21.621
very special to me.

42:21.665 --> 42:23.164
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:23.166 --> 42:24.407
- Good night, chef.
- Thank you so much.

42:24.417 --> 42:27.168
- Wait, what?
- Why would you do that?

42:27.212 --> 42:30.755
- Good night, chef.
- Can't wait for you
to find out.

42:30.799 --> 42:34.592
- Well done, courtney.
- ( cheering )

42:36.346 --> 42:38.429
gordon:<i> Next time</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

42:38.473 --> 42:40.557
This is the first field trip
of the competition.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.810
We want you to create a burger
worthy of the next level.

42:43.895 --> 42:48.356
- Burgers should be easy.
- Do not underestimate
this challenge.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.441
- I was just praying.
- Let's go!

42:50.485 --> 42:53.403
I don't want lose
anybody I've mentored.
Don't do this to me.

42:53.446 --> 42:55.863
Nyesha:
I am more sure than ever that
I have the next level chef.

42:55.865 --> 42:58.741
The idea is to cook
in the basement,
not set it on fire, yes?

42:58.743 --> 43:00.326
We already in hell, baby.

43:00.370 --> 43:02.328
If a chef doesn't perform,
that's it. Game over.

43:02.372 --> 43:04.539
That is the most
unappetizing burger.

43:04.583 --> 43:07.125
( spits )
it's disgusting.
