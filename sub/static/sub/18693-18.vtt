You once asked me
what I was afraid of.

38:01.586 --> 38:02.586
It's this.

38:26.645 --> 38:28.178
I see you busting out

38:28.213 --> 38:29.423
the Baijiu for the
new pack members?

38:29.447 --> 38:32.248
I will never be OK with
Russell turning mundanes,

38:32.284 --> 38:33.484
but you can't knock tradition.

38:33.518 --> 38:35.196
And besides,
this was one of the few things

38:35.220 --> 38:36.597
that got me through my
first couple days here.

38:36.621 --> 38:38.588
- Hm.
- Other than you.

38:38.623 --> 38:40.290
How's Bat doing?

38:41.359 --> 38:42.503
MAIA: About as well
as can be expected.

38:42.527 --> 38:44.360
- Hm.
- But I've got him.

38:45.564 --> 38:47.397
Alright everybody! Listen up!

38:49.501 --> 38:50.661
For those of you returning...

38:51.968 --> 38:53.133
welcome back.

38:55.340 --> 38:56.540
To those of you who are new...

38:58.145 --> 38:59.425
I know you're feeling afraid.

39:01.050 --> 39:02.770
And you won't have to
go through this alone.

39:04.549 --> 39:06.482
Welcome, werewolves...

39:07.586 --> 39:08.551
to the New York pack.

IZZY: Saving me from Azazel...

39:45.523 --> 39:47.457
it must have all been
part of Jonathan's plan.

39:52.564 --> 39:54.464
I was the one to bring
him to the Institute.

39:54.499 --> 39:57.467
Don't.
We're all responsible for this.

39:58.570 --> 40:01.204
At least now we know Valentine
can never get the mirror

40:01.239 --> 40:02.239
and raise the Angel.

40:03.170 --> 40:04.235
I'm not so sure.

40:05.644 --> 40:08.378
Look,
even with our pure angel blood,

40:08.413 --> 40:10.380
doesn't it seem strange
that Clary's runes

40:10.415 --> 40:12.593
would be powerful enough to
destroy a Mortal Instrument?

40:12.617 --> 40:14.517
And why didn't it
destroy the sword?

40:15.587 --> 40:18.221
What if the mirror I destroyed
isn't the Mortal Mirror?

40:18.256 --> 40:20.534
Then why would your mom give
it to the warlocks to protect?

40:20.558 --> 40:22.258
Maybe she thought it was.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.426
We all did.

40:23.461 --> 40:26.262
Maybe whoever made it
wanted it that way.

40:27.432 --> 40:29.666
To distract people from
finding the real one.

40:31.603 --> 40:34.470
Uh, well,
the legend says that the mirror's

40:34.506 --> 40:36.339
meant to not be easily found.

40:36.374 --> 40:38.207
That the...
the angels hold the key...

40:40.412 --> 40:43.379
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

40:46.451 --> 40:47.517
The water.

40:48.553 --> 40:49.585
It's a reflection.

40:49.621 --> 40:51.521
What water?
What are you talking about?

40:51.556 --> 40:53.356
I didn't destroy the mirror.

40:53.391 --> 40:54.602
These visions I've been having,

40:54.626 --> 40:56.359
they're a message
from the Angel...

40:58.330 --> 41:00.363
The Mirror is Lake Lyn.
