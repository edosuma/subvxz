WEBVTT

00:17.720 --> 00:20.480
-What are you doing?
-Well, I didn't want to disturb you.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.240
-What do you mean?
-I was gonna come in and eat at the table,

00:23.320 --> 00:25.720
but I didn't know if you was busy
so I'm having it here.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.880
But those aren't the only two options,
are they,

00:29.000 --> 00:31.440
eat in my house
or just outside my house?

00:31.520 --> 00:34.800
-There's the rest of the fucking world.
-All right, don't get the hump!

00:34.880 --> 00:36.760
So, did you talk to that bird about me?

00:36.840 --> 00:37.680
Yeah.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.320
She'll meet up...

00:39.680 --> 00:41.200
for a meal, or whatever.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.400
-[Pat] Really?
-Yeah.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.680
-And you was honest about me?
-[Tony] Pretty much.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.800
What, and she still wants to meet me?
What's the catch?

00:48.880 --> 00:53.360
Well, she wanted me to be honest
about her to you as well.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.000
She's a sex worker.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.800
-A prossie?
-Yeah.

00:58.000 --> 00:58.840
Result!

00:59.480 --> 01:01.000
-[slurps]
-You're not bothered?

01:01.440 --> 01:03.000
She ain't got AIDS, has she?

01:04.240 --> 01:05.720
Would that be a deal-breaker?

01:06.280 --> 01:07.160
No.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.000
No, she hasn't got AIDS.

01:10.040 --> 01:14.240
-And she's lovely, and smart, and funny.
-She'll earn a few quid for that an' all.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.400
Just split the bill.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.360
-Lovely jubbly.
-[Tony] Right, OK...

01:19.720 --> 01:21.360
-[slurping]
-Off we go.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.320
Why?

01:23.400 --> 01:26.040
'Cause it's weird,
a postman having a picnic in your garden.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.280
What's weird about it?

01:28.280 --> 01:29.400
Get out.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.120
Where's all this coming from?

01:31.200 --> 01:33.200
[gentle music plays]

01:33.960 --> 01:35.760
Out! Fuckin' hell.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.720
[kids laughing and squealing]

01:50.240 --> 01:51.360
You all right, George?

01:51.440 --> 01:52.640
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

01:54.680 --> 01:56.520
Are Mum and Dad getting a divorce?

01:58.440 --> 01:59.440
I don't know.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.040
I want them to still be my mum and dad.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.680
Whatever happens,
even if they're not always together,

02:04.760 --> 02:06.880
they'll still be your mum and dad,
and love you, and...

02:06.960 --> 02:08.360
be an even better mum and dad,

02:08.440 --> 02:11.000
you can play them off against each other,
get anything you want.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.760
-What toy do you want?
-Dunno.

02:12.840 --> 02:16.640
Well, think big. I reckon
you'll be able to get a quad bike.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.000
Maybe even a crossbow,
if you play your cards right. [chuckles]

02:20.520 --> 02:21.680
You'll be living the dream.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.200
You'll be like, "Mum, Dad,
I'm off down the pub. Don't wait up."

02:24.280 --> 02:25.400
[both giggle]

02:26.440 --> 02:27.440
It'll be fine.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.280
-[boy] Hi, George.
-[George] Hi.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.960
-Morning.
-Oh, happy birthday!

02:38.400 --> 02:40.560
-How did you know?
-It's on your records.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.840
-Oh, yeah.
-[Valerie] Any plans?

02:42.920 --> 02:44.760
Just a meal at home with my family.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.280
-Who will cook, your mum or your dad?
-Me.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.760
Well, happy birthday.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
Thank you.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.480
Happy birthday!

02:56.880 --> 02:57.880
Thank you.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.080
-Cup of tea, then?
-Yes, please.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.280
No, you make it.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.400
Why?

03:02.840 --> 03:05.520
You're the work experience.
You have to start at the bottom.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.440
It's Sandy's birthday,
make her a cup of tea.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.520
It's your birthday?

03:08.600 --> 03:09.440
Er, yeah.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.800
-[Tony] Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.160
Is there going to be cake?

03:13.240 --> 03:14.400
Just make the tea!

03:14.480 --> 03:15.600
God!

03:17.320 --> 03:19.600
-Is there gonna be any cake, though?
-[snorts]

03:20.360 --> 03:21.720
So, you're a Virgo?

03:22.360 --> 03:23.680
-Yeah.
-[Kath] Yeah.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.440
Do your horoscope for you if you like?

03:25.520 --> 03:26.800
Nah, 'cause it's pointless.

03:26.880 --> 03:30.280
-It's not pointless, actually.
-How can people born around the same time,

03:30.360 --> 03:33.920
from all over the world,
share similar traits just because of that?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.480
-It's rubbish.
-It's true!

03:35.560 --> 03:38.000
Virgos are smart, modest,

03:38.080 --> 03:40.320
capable, dedicated.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.000
See? Fits, don't it?

03:42.080 --> 03:44.240
Yeah, everyone likes to think
they're those things!

03:44.320 --> 03:47.640
That's why they make it flattering,
so you believe it. If it said,

03:47.720 --> 03:52.040
"Oh, you're boring, ugly, thick,
and shit at everything,"

03:52.120 --> 03:53.400
you wouldn't go back, would ya?

03:53.480 --> 03:56.480
Also, they make it vague
so you can make it fit.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.320
I want to see one in the paper that says,
"Happy birthday, Rita Wainthrope

04:00.400 --> 04:02.320
of 7 Acacia Drive, Wigan.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.480
You're going to get fired
from your job today

04:04.560 --> 04:06.880
'cause everyone hates you
and the boss thinks you're a slut."

04:06.960 --> 04:08.040
Then I'd believe it.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.720
-Always have to get silly, don't you?
-[sniggers]

04:15.040 --> 04:16.000
You all right?

04:18.040 --> 04:19.040
[glumly] Yeah.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.360
I'm just... feeling a bit...

04:22.520 --> 04:24.960
I dunno... 30.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.360
Yeah, I hated 30.

04:32.680 --> 04:33.680
Quite liked 40.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.280
Fifty was all right.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.120
It's not your age, is it?
It's what's happening...

04:39.760 --> 04:40.760
in your life.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.120
Not a lot.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.600
Do you want to go for a coffee?

04:49.920 --> 04:51.240
-Yeah.
-Come on, then.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.440
Do you know what my parents got me
for my birthday?

04:58.160 --> 05:00.000
A set of saucepans and a super mop.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.040
[chuckles]

05:01.280 --> 05:02.440
What's super about it?

05:02.520 --> 05:04.760
It's got an ultra-absorbent sponge head.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.600
-It cleans, dries, and absorbs in one go.
-Sure.

05:08.000 --> 05:08.960
Do you know how?

05:09.280 --> 05:11.080
-Wring-Max technology.
-[laughs]

05:11.160 --> 05:12.800
For maximum wringing. [chuckles]

05:12.880 --> 05:13.960
Good.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.960
I feel bad whinging to you.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.320
My problems probably seem so trivial.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.880
No, not at all.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.320
Also...

05:25.600 --> 05:28.080
I've been wanting to apologize
for something I said once too.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.640
What?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.760
When I asked you to be happy.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.480
I realized it's a stupid thing to say.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.480
No, it's...

05:37.000 --> 05:38.320
You wanted me to be happy.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
I get it.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.640
People think that...

05:43.040 --> 05:45.440
all those things I miss doing with Lisa,

05:45.760 --> 05:48.480
I could just do them anyway,
and it'll make me feel better.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.840
But, um... they're missing the point.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.120
I don't miss doing things with Lisa,

05:53.200 --> 05:55.640
I miss doing nothing... with Lisa.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.680
Do you know what I mean?
Just... sitting at home,

05:58.760 --> 06:01.480
wouldn't even have to go out,
or do anything, or even talk,

06:01.560 --> 06:02.600
you know, just...

06:02.680 --> 06:04.680
sitting there, knowing she was there.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.480
Sometimes, I'd just look over at her.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.800
-This has turned out well again.
-[strained chuckle]

06:15.680 --> 06:17.080
-[Sandy sighs]
-Ah...

06:18.080 --> 06:22.040
So, does it do lino, and tiles, and wood?

06:22.120 --> 06:23.200
It does everything.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.480
-Brilliant!
-Yeah.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.600
-[laughter]
-[Simon] What do you drive?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.400
It's a little Mini...

06:31.480 --> 06:33.520
But I don't drive it now,
I'm trying to minimize--

06:33.600 --> 06:34.520
-Hiya.
-Hi.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.480
Hiya, just... Simon, isn't it?

06:36.560 --> 06:38.280
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Tony.

06:38.920 --> 06:39.960
You're here a lot.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.880
-Yeah, my mum's in here.
-Oh, right.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.440
Yeah, it breaks my heart.
They all break my heart, I love 'em all.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.240
I wish I could take them all home.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.440
-[Simon chuckles]
-Aw... That's sweet.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.560
Maybe start with your mum first,
take her home, and...

06:54.120 --> 06:57.440
Yeah, I can't,
not with my circumstances at the moment.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.440
-[Tony] Oh.
-[Simon] I do what I can.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.920
Maybe everyone's in the same boat.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.400
-Yeah, sure.
-[Tony] Yeah.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.880
Nice to meet ya.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.680
-Yeah.
-Okay.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.840
See you later, babe.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.400
[Tony] Fuckin' hell!

07:12.120 --> 07:12.960
What?

07:13.920 --> 07:14.760
Him.

07:15.720 --> 07:16.880
What about him?

07:17.640 --> 07:21.080
He's doing his...
"sensitive man" thing, isn't he?

07:21.160 --> 07:24.920
He's trying to be all kind and lovely
to you, to impress you.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.600
I don't know. Call me old-fashioned,

07:26.680 --> 07:28.760
but it kinda works,
being kind and lovely.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.400
-It's fake!
-[scoffs]

07:32.280 --> 07:35.480
He probably works in a bank
and has people's houses repossessed.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.040
-[chuckles]
-He's doing his...

07:37.680 --> 07:41.120
[mockingly] "Oh, you know, I'm so caring
in a cruel world, in't I?"

07:41.640 --> 07:44.040
-His... "Oh, isn't famine awful?"
-[sniggers]

07:44.480 --> 07:46.520
"I'd like to take them all
to McDonald's, babe."

07:46.600 --> 07:48.360
-[giggles]
-[Tony sniggers]

07:48.440 --> 07:49.440
Stop it!

07:50.240 --> 07:51.120
Oh...

07:51.200 --> 07:55.360
Well... I don't feel the same about him
the way I do about you.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.280
Good.

07:56.360 --> 08:00.040
But, well...
you're not an option, are you?

08:01.200 --> 08:03.560
I think you're brilliant, Tony, and...

08:04.160 --> 08:06.960
But at least he doesn't go on
about another woman the way you do.

08:07.480 --> 08:11.040
And I know... I understand, Tony,
I get why you do, and it's...

08:11.880 --> 08:13.520
it's lovely, it really is.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.240
But I don't want to be the other woman.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.040
Oh, did I blow it? Sorry, I...

08:21.120 --> 08:23.920
It's fine, really.
There's no need to be sorry. It's...

08:25.280 --> 08:27.920
I like this, though. I love this.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.160
Whatever this is.

08:30.840 --> 08:34.080
Just being with you... all the time,

08:34.160 --> 08:35.160
the same...

08:35.800 --> 08:37.000
forever...

08:37.080 --> 08:38.800
like <i>Groundhog Day.</i> [chuckles]

08:38.880 --> 08:39.920
[chuckles sadly]

08:41.040 --> 08:42.040
Yeah, well...

08:42.480 --> 08:43.880
I get all that, but...

08:45.040 --> 08:46.640
not everyone's the same, Tony.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.600
Right.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.000
[wistful music plays]

08:54.120 --> 08:55.240
[nurse chuckles wryly]

09:01.880 --> 09:03.560
I don't know whether to psychoanalyze you

09:03.640 --> 09:06.000
or take you down the vet
and get you fucking put down.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.480
You gotta get out there, mate.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.600
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.360
Dunk the monk.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.960
Bang some beaver.
Shoot some <i>Schpritz.</i>

09:19.000 --> 09:20.240
What's that?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.680
It's Yiddish for spunk.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.360
Oh, right.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.360
Listen, the offer's still open if you want
to come out with me and the boys.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.840
We're actually getting messy tonight,
as it goes.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.520
Local pub crawl and a minge hunt.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.520
Um... That's a very kind offer,

09:38.600 --> 09:40.680
but I can't tonight, unfortunately.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.840
Poof!

09:45.000 --> 09:46.120
[cat purring]

09:46.400 --> 09:47.840
He's asking who you are.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.720
They're from the local newspaper.
[chuckles]

09:53.040 --> 09:53.920
So...

09:54.680 --> 09:57.920
when did you... first discover
you could speak to cats?

09:58.880 --> 10:01.680
Well, it was not long
after my daughter died.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.040
Um... he was her cat, you see.

10:04.120 --> 10:08.000
And I just started talking to him
about missing Jenny, and...

10:09.080 --> 10:10.160
we bonded.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.560
It's nice to have someone who understands.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.520
Yep... [sighs]

10:16.600 --> 10:17.600
...it is.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.840
Uh... what's his name?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.760
-[woman] Frank.
-Frank.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.000
She named him after her dad.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.320
That's my husband.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.320
[inhales shakily] He passed away
a couple of years before Jenny.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.840
Would you like another cup of tea?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.600
Uh...

10:36.680 --> 10:38.160
No, thanks. Um...

10:39.080 --> 10:41.280
Uh... can we take a quick picture?

10:41.360 --> 10:42.360
Oh, yeah.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.120
[camera clicks]

10:44.200 --> 10:46.000
-Great.
-[woman] Is that it, then?

10:47.360 --> 10:48.360
Yeah.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.280
Um...

10:49.360 --> 10:51.880
Are you hungry?
I could make you something to eat.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.720
No. No, thanks.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.000
[sadly] Oh, all right, then.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.480
-[Tony] Thanks very much.
-Thank you.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.600
-[Tony] Right, bye-bye.
-Bye-bye. Thank you.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.240
[Tony] That's so sad.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.920
-[Lenny] She's happy enough.
-[Tony] No, she's not.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.080
She wants to tell her story.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.960
She wants to see her husband
and her daughter's name in the paper.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.520
The cat thing's just an in.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.760
She's lonely.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.240
-Did you forget something?
-[Tony] Um...

11:26.320 --> 11:29.000
Sorry about your husband and daughter.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.680
-[sentimental music plays]
-Oh, thank you.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.360
Frank and Jenny?

11:33.440 --> 11:34.360
Yes.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.160
Bye-bye.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.840
Oh, bye-bye. Thank you.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.280
If I could live till he's 50,
that would make me happy.

11:51.800 --> 11:55.280
I don't think he'll live longer than that,
to be honest. Think he'd struggle.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.080
He struggles now.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.560
Roger Realms.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.240
Have I told you about him?
Roger by name, Roger by nature?

12:05.040 --> 12:06.200
Who's Roger Realms?

12:06.280 --> 12:08.160
Agent. Used to work with him.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.240
Would only sign black lads.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.200
I'd often wander into Roger's
dressing room, and there he'd be

12:13.280 --> 12:16.080
with some boy hanging off him,
he was basically an arse peg.

12:16.600 --> 12:20.120
Went early doors with AIDS,
but good luck to him, you know.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.040
God bless you, Roger.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.200
I've run a few
of these little local newspapers

12:29.280 --> 12:32.480
around the country. I know
that doesn't make me Rupert Murdoch.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.440
But this is the only one
that loses money.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.960
-Is it?
-Effectively, yes.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.880
I mean, I own the building,
so it's not a massive problem.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Look, the fact is, uh... I'm semi-retired.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.480
And I'm wondering is it...

12:50.080 --> 12:51.400
is it worth the headache?

12:51.480 --> 12:54.600
I mean, I'm just thinking
I could throw in the towel.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.520
Sell the property and get a nice lump sum.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.680
Could you give us more time,
do you think?

13:02.760 --> 13:04.360
[inhales sharply] Uh...

13:04.920 --> 13:05.880
Just if we could...

13:06.280 --> 13:07.560
-make more money, then...
-Look--

13:07.640 --> 13:09.000
-We could find a way, I'm sure.
-OK.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.560
I mean, it's going to take a bit of time
to sell the property,

13:11.640 --> 13:13.600
get all the paperwork right. Um...

13:14.240 --> 13:15.280
And if you can...

13:16.320 --> 13:20.080
Well, if you can make me an offer
I can't refuse, yes, then I'll look at it.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.400
But quite frankly, I...

13:23.120 --> 13:25.520
I'm sorry,
but I really don't see that happening.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.840
-Sorry.
-No, I'm sorry...

13:30.920 --> 13:33.040
that we're not making much money.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.160
-[Matt] So, speak soon.
-[owner] OK, thank you.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.720
OK, everyone? Um...

13:48.800 --> 13:51.680
Listen up. That was Mr. Middleton, Paul.

13:52.240 --> 13:56.280
Some of you know, he, um, owns everything:
the paper and the building.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.160
Um...

13:58.560 --> 14:00.320
He wants to stop running the paper.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.880
What, sell it?

14:01.960 --> 14:03.320
[Matt] Well, he wants to...

14:03.400 --> 14:05.280
um... close the paper,

14:05.840 --> 14:07.360
and then sell the building.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.920
He'll sell it to a property developer.
This will be luxury flats.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.000
[Kath] Well, I'll be all right.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.760
Tambury Brewery have already said
they'd take me on.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.720
Think the boss fancies me.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.760
Right. Well...

14:21.240 --> 14:24.760
Well, that's the end
of <i>The Tambury Gazette,</i> kids.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.840
Don't worry,

14:25.920 --> 14:28.720
we'll all just get another shitty job
that barely pays enough to live.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.280
[Sandy]
This is the only job I've ever liked.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.000
I've got to have a job.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.040
My mum's disabled.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.760
And my daddy can't work.

14:37.080 --> 14:40.680
My brother and sister, they're in school,
and they get nothing as it is.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.600
-OK.
-So I've got to go find another job

14:42.680 --> 14:45.080
-that I'll hate. Again.
-[Tony] OK.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.480
-Well, we'll save the paper, and...
-How?

14:48.560 --> 14:52.000
We'll get more revenue. Kath'll get more.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.440
-How?
-[Tony] 'Cause you're really...

14:54.840 --> 14:58.240
good at your... job. You'll charge more
for advertising, like...

14:58.320 --> 15:00.880
Tambury Brewery,
they'll pay more, won't they?

15:00.960 --> 15:02.840
Or we get a loan.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.640
Happens all the time.
We get a loan... We'll buy the...

15:06.160 --> 15:10.200
building, and then we'll pay back the loan
with the profit from the...

15:10.760 --> 15:12.760
the paper, and pay ourselves a wage,

15:12.840 --> 15:14.840
and that'll be... then, it'll be our...

15:15.760 --> 15:18.000
business to make it... work.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.800
So, don't worry. [taps keyboard idly]

15:21.360 --> 15:23.120
[choking back tears] You promise?

15:23.720 --> 15:24.760
[Sandy sniffles]

15:27.280 --> 15:28.760
You... you'll save the paper?

15:29.760 --> 15:30.880
Yeah, I will.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.240
-[Sandy] OK.
-We will.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.440
[mournful music plays]

15:40.720 --> 15:41.760
[Tony] Hmm.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
How are you?

15:45.640 --> 15:47.800
[halfheartedly] Yeah... you know.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.840
That's pretty positive coming from you.
[chuckling]

15:53.760 --> 15:58.120
I was trying to be all British
and not burden you with my... troubles.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.440
Well, us British love gossip.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.560
So, spill the beans.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.080
Same, really. I'm... still a bit mental.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.040
Trying hard to care about stuff.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.360
And then today,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.400
we find out that the owner of the paper,

16:16.800 --> 16:18.600
he's selling up and...

16:19.200 --> 16:20.920
we'll all lose our jobs.

16:21.000 --> 16:21.840
Oh, no.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.720
That's not the bad bit.
I was fine with that.

16:23.800 --> 16:27.920
But then Sandy starts crying
'cause it's the only job she's ever liked,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.760
and so, I've got to try
and save the paper for her sake.

16:31.880 --> 16:36.000
And my brother-in-law, who was sleeping
on the floor of the office,

16:36.080 --> 16:39.400
is now sleeping at Lenny's council house

16:39.480 --> 16:41.440
'cause Lenny's shacked up with June,

16:41.520 --> 16:45.760
who persuaded him
to give her fat kid a job at the paper.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.680
Just think, if I'd have killed myself,
I'd have missed all this.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.600
[Anne chuckles]

16:56.760 --> 16:57.920
[Matt] Brainstorming session.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.640
How do we turn the paper around?
How do we make it more profitable?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.080
We need to go more tabloid.

17:02.520 --> 17:06.600
Gossip, celebrity stuff, fashion.
Who looks shit an' that, you know?

17:06.680 --> 17:08.040
"Who looks shit an' that"?

17:08.560 --> 17:09.400
Yeah.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.240
Well, pictures of cellulite,
that kind of thing.

17:12.840 --> 17:14.720
You know, amazing stories.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.800
Paranormal, weird stuff.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.160
I love that.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.720
-Right.
-[Tony] Right.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.520
You want tabloid,
you want to speak to my agent, Ken.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.280
Yeah, we did. He's mental.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.440
Well, we could run the Liberace story.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.240
N-No, we couldn't.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.880
-Well, what is it?
-His agent reckons

17:31.960 --> 17:35.040
-he was bummed by the ghost of Liberace.
-[Lenny] Mm-hmm.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.320
-Well, it might be true.
-How the fuck can it be true?

17:40.400 --> 17:41.440
We don't know everything

17:41.520 --> 17:43.160
-about the paranormal.
-Lot of weird stuff.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.840
Right. It's all about belief, isn't it?

17:44.920 --> 17:47.000
You know, that's not up to us,
what people believe.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.440
Papers are always covering
religious miracles and stuff.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.400
-Yeah, and they're always bollocks.
-It's not for us to say.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.040
It is for us to say, we're writing it.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.360
Yeah, but we're only reporting
what was said.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.560
-Right.
-Ghosts do exist, though.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.320
Loads of people have seen 'em,
and there's no other explanation.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.840
Well, there is another explanation:

18:03.920 --> 18:05.760
they haven't seen them
'cause they don't exist.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.200
How about that one?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.360
No one has ever turned into a ghost.

18:09.840 --> 18:13.920
When you die, they burn you or bury you,
you never exist again, the end.

but I love watching you eat.

-You're like a fat toad eating a big worm.

19:56.440 --> 19:57.680
A big creamy worm.

Hmm?

20:00.240 --> 20:02.040
Will you come for a drink with me tonight?

I'm just saying as a favor. Please?
I still want to talk to people.

is my therapist, and I have to pay him.

-And he's an idiot.
-Right.

but that's not possible at the moment.

of my office to taking Lenny's flat,

20:22.520 --> 20:24.200
and in return,
I give his fat stepson a job

20:24.280 --> 20:25.840
at a paper that I'm now gonna lose.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.560

20:27.640 --> 20:28.480
Well...

20:30.280 --> 20:31.800
actually, being needed is...

Right. You see,
you're making me feel better already.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.120

Do you want to sit down?

21:10.680 --> 21:12.400
-[Roxy] OK.
-[Pat grunts]

21:13.240 --> 21:17.160

-[Pat chuckles awkwardly]
-[laughs]

21:19.600 --> 21:21.120
Yeah, and I made you laugh!

-I'm nervous. Nervous laughter.
-Oh, sorry.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.080
I didn't mean... Yeah.
I dunno why I said that.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.400
I was just a bit nervous.
I'm not a rapist or anything.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.480
-Oh, OK!
-Shouldn't have said rape. Want a drink?

21:29.560 --> 21:31.200
-Er, yes.
-Yeah? What do you want?

21:31.280 --> 21:33.080
-Um...
-I'm just having a house red.

21:33.520 --> 21:36.160

-You all right?

22:15.480 --> 22:17.440
Shouldn't you have
a confidentiality agreement?

-I didn't say your name, mate.
-Right,

22:19.440 --> 22:21.280

22:44.760 --> 22:46.200
I should go check on Tony.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.480
Go on, then.
Bang some beaver for us, yeah?

-Size of that mushroom!
-[Roxy chuckles]

22:53.000 --> 22:54.680
It's like a quarter...
Only a quarter of it.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.440
It's good value, innit, for you?

22:57.160 --> 22:58.400
This was 13 quid.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.680
[Roxy laughs]

22:59.760 --> 23:02.360
[laughs]
No, I'm serious. This was 13 quid.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.480
So, how comes you're single, then?

23:05.560 --> 23:07.520
'Cause I used to be twice this size.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.680
[chuckles lightly]

23:09.040 --> 23:10.200
[Pat] No, I'm serious.

23:10.720 --> 23:11.760
At my heaviest...

23:12.680 --> 23:14.040
about 24 stone.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.160
I lost it all, didn't I,
when I became a postman.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.160
I think big blokes are sexy.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.880
No, I was an absolute mess.

23:20.960 --> 23:24.560
I was a car crash under there.
I've still got a lot of loose skin, but...

23:25.280 --> 23:27.360
-I'm saving up to get it sorted.
-[chuckles]

23:36.760 --> 23:37.920
No, this...

23:38.800 --> 23:39.640
the date.

23:39.720 --> 23:40.800
I'm enjoying it as well.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.760
You know, I know you're out of my league
and that, but... ahh! Yeah.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.120
No, it's good. It's been fun.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.440
-Fuckin' hell.
-Maybe he's right, though.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.000
Maybe I should bang some beaver.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.760
Bang some...?

23:56.840 --> 23:58.440
Bang some beaver. His words, not mine.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.880
Yeah, exactly. They're his words,

23:59.960 --> 24:02.560
they should never be said
by any other human being.

24:03.720 --> 24:04.800

Don't look.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.000
No. No.

To talk to each other.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.480
-Not to be chatted up by you.
-Why not? Come on, come over with me.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.440
No, no, no, no!

24:29.520 --> 24:30.640
-Please?
-No.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.680
Just sit over there with me.
Not to make a move, just sit at the table.

24:33.760 --> 24:37.600
So, to talk to each other and drink?
Not to bother any...

24:37.680 --> 24:38.520
Yeah.

24:40.640 --> 24:41.480
All right.

[Tony] Please.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.080
OK.

Getting divorced, probably.

25:24.480 --> 25:25.320

Tony's wife's died.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.680

What is?

Just talking to us. It's not--
