09:03.940 --> 09:05.191
The girls are just easy targets.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.732
Please,
look me in the eye and tell me

09:08.780 --> 09:10.975
that Hanna is not in
any kind of trouble.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.716
She's not..

09:15.750 --> 09:17.217
...in trouble.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.920
Sheila, that-that swing

09:26.960 --> 09:27.984
has been hanging from that tree

09:28.030 --> 09:29.657
since we bought the house.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.998
I wouldn't even know
how to take it down.

09:32.870 --> 09:35.668
The whole tree?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.292
I'll call you back.

09:37.340 --> 09:38.398
Okay.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.600
[phone beeps]

09:40.270 --> 09:41.498
Hey.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.303
Whoa, what are those?

09:43.340 --> 09:46.002
Well, you had mentioned
you'd forgotten to eat

09:46.050 --> 09:48.541
and I figured your cabinets
were already empty.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.013
Oh, we only tossed condiments

09:50.050 --> 09:53.087
but that's so sweet of you,
honey, thank you.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.281
I have one more closet to tackle
before we take a dinner break.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.617
Will you join us?

09:56.660 --> 09:58.753
Oh, no, actually,
I-I really can't stay.

09:58.790 --> 09:59.950
Another time then.

10:03.500 --> 10:07.266
So, you as ticked off as I am?

10:07.300 --> 10:08.289
About what?

10:08.340 --> 10:09.864
About Mona.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.529
Hanna should not have
pulled her in any of this.

10:13.570 --> 10:16.539
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

10:16.580 --> 10:17.672
She can help, it might be nice

10:17.710 --> 10:19.541
to have a different perspective.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.104
(Emily)
Her perspective is wart.

10:21.150 --> 10:23.209
She needs to take Mary
off of her list.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.485
Yeah, you're probably right.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.112
She should.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.957
- Do you need this?
- No. But, thanks.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.720
- Actually, I got to go.
- Oh, why. What's up?

10:32.760 --> 10:34.079
- More wedding stuff?
- Yeah.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.052
Ezra is flipping out
about the guest list.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.318
- I'll see you.
- Okay. Bye.

10:38.370 --> 10:39.860
Thank you.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.167
Mom?

10:44.210 --> 10:45.734
'Hey, when you come down
will you bring'

10:45.770 --> 10:47.909
'some more tape with you?‘

10:55.480 --> 10:57.118
(female #1)
'Why are you calling me here?‘

10:57.150 --> 10:58.412
(male #1)
'You know why I'm calling you.'

10:58.450 --> 11:00.179
'You thought you could
pin this on me?‘

11:00.220 --> 11:02.211
(female #1)
'I could pin
a lot on you, Peter.‘

11:02.260 --> 11:04.979
(male #1)
'I think burying a dead body
in my yard is plenty.‘

11:05.030 --> 11:07.282
(female #1)
'I didn't have a choice.‘

11:07.330 --> 11:09.855
'If it wasn't Jessica it
would have me six feet under.‘

11:09.900 --> 11:11.492
'I knew what _
you two were planmng.‘

11:11.530 --> 11:13.828
(male #1)
'Six feet
isn't deep enough for you.'

11:13.870 --> 11:15.531
What the hell is this?

11:15.570 --> 11:16.798
Where is that coming from?

11:16.840 --> 11:18.330
(male #1)
'You know why I'm calling you.'

11:18.370 --> 11:20.565
'You thought you could
pin this on me?‘

11:20.610 --> 11:23.499
- Peter, what is going on?
- How did she get in here?

11:23.540 --> 11:25.303
. (male #1)
In my yard is plenty.‘

11:25.350 --> 11:26.749
[shatters]

11:26.780 --> 11:30.113
This is what happens when you
open the door to a lunatic.

11:33.390 --> 11:35.278
Damn it!

11:36.290 --> 11:37.416
[door closes]

11:37.460 --> 11:38.859
(female #1)
'Why are you calling me here?‘

11:38.890 --> 11:40.152
(male #1)
'You know why I'm calling you.'

11:40.190 --> 11:41.726
'You thought you could
pin this on me?‘

11:41.760 --> 11:43.728
(female #1)
'I could pin
a lot on you, Peter.‘

11:43.770 --> 11:46.796
(male #1)
'I think burying a dead body
in my yard is plenty.‘

11:46.830 --> 11:48.695
(female #1)
'I didn't have a choice.‘

11:48.740 --> 11:51.959
'If it wasn't Jessica it
would have me six feet under.‘

11:58.180 --> 12:01.809
- So, is she out there?
- No.

12:01.850 --> 12:03.442
Who recorded that conversation?

12:03.480 --> 12:04.469
How should I know?

12:04.520 --> 12:06.181
It was a hundred years ago.

12:06.220 --> 12:07.187
Six.

12:11.090 --> 12:13.388
Why would she think that you and
Ali's mom wanted to kill her?

12:13.430 --> 12:14.727
Please, Spencer.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.820
These are the delusional
ramblings of a Sick person.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.566
Who else would do
something like this?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.659
- What're you doin'?
- Calling the police.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.031
No, no, no. Don't do that.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.332
Somebody broke into our house.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.235
You don't need to
call the police.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.475
- I'm calling the police--
- Please don't call them.

12:30.780 --> 12:31.940
Please.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.118
I'll call you back
before you go to sleep.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.787
Tell Jason I say hey.

12:45.830 --> 12:48.481
Make sure she
takes her folic acid.

12:48.530 --> 12:51.624
That was Mona.
Something about acid.

12:51.670 --> 12:53.023
Goodnight.

12:54.470 --> 12:56.267
Yeah, you too.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.359
You can tell All
you love her in front of me, M.

12:58.410 --> 13:01.368
That hasn't been a secret
smce we were In Brownies.

13:01.410 --> 13:04.208
Okay, please,
use shouldn't be touching that.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.707
You still don't realize
how badly you need me, do you?

13:06.750 --> 13:08.069
Look, I didn't ask you to
play this game.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.769
You also didn't ask me
to find out the name

13:09.820 --> 13:13.449
of the fertility doctor who did
Alison's procedure but I did.

13:13.490 --> 13:15.515
Don't you wanna know
who bank rolled it?

13:15.560 --> 13:18.711
That person might
also be your baby's daddy.

13:18.760 --> 13:19.784
Still takes two, hon.

13:19.830 --> 13:20.888
Okay. Don't mess with me, Mona.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.352
If you know something
spill it.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.527
I don't know anything except
for the name of the doctor

13:24.570 --> 13:26.959
and you'll meet him
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

13:27.000 --> 13:27.989
You made an appointment?

13:28.040 --> 13:30.065
You're going as a couple.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.909
Dress appropriately.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.641
She isn't goin' to give you
a polygraph test.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.147
She doesn't have to.

13:42.180 --> 13:44.148
Her mother knows I'm lying
when I talk in my sleep.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.748
You don't talk in your sleep.

13:45.790 --> 13:47.212
I do when I've lied to her.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.443
Hanna,
you've covered your tracks.

13:48.490 --> 13:49.514
Really?

13:49.560 --> 13:51.118
'Cause I think
I've made them worse.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.957
Dumping those receipts
on the floor

13:52.990 --> 13:54.287
didn't make it look
like an accident.

13:54.330 --> 13:55.797
Furey can't prove anything.

13:55.830 --> 13:58.651
And the important thing is that
Spencer's mistake is gone.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.725
Yeah, well, if she could make
a mistake like that

14:00.770 --> 14:03.432
what other stupid stuff
have the rest of us done.

14:03.470 --> 14:06.303
I didn't care if they left
my bracelet in that car.

14:06.340 --> 14:09.138
I.. H tossed
those shovels behind the shed

14:09.180 --> 14:11.068
and then they just ran off.

14:13.050 --> 14:14.039
Hey, Ezra.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.776
I come bearing gifts.

14:16.820 --> 14:18.014
Hmm, thanks.

14:18.050 --> 14:19.039
Do you have anything stronger?

14:19.090 --> 14:20.682
What are you stressed about?

14:20.720 --> 14:24.508
I'm the one who's best man maybe
coming down the aisle via Skype.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.357
Does that mean
he can wear half a tuxedo?

14:26.390 --> 14:30.156
Honestly, I just wanted to make
a commitment to someone I love

14:30.200 --> 14:32.964
and now, it's about
everybody else's agenda.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.127
Wish we had gone by
the sandals and gelatos.

14:35.170 --> 14:39.800
Just a private ceremony for two
and a perfect Tuscan village.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.307
Who other two?

14:41.340 --> 14:43.103
Did we just get us invited?

14:46.180 --> 14:48.045
- Hey, sunshine.
- Hi.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.243
- Have you eaten?
- Oh, I'm not really hungry.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.882
I think I'm just gonna
go upstairs.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.138
It's been a really long day.

14:55.190 --> 14:56.953
Sorry, guys. Goodnight.

15:00.390 --> 15:01.926
That, my friends

15:01.960 --> 15:04.224
is what a happy bride
looks like.

15:05.370 --> 15:07.224
It's been a long journey for us.

15:07.270 --> 15:10.364
And we talked about having
a child our first date.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.594
Didn't we, Em?

15:11.640 --> 15:13.062
Uh, yeah.

15:13.110 --> 15:14.338
Have you discussed
which one of you

15:14.380 --> 15:16.177
would, uh, like
to carry the child?

15:16.210 --> 15:19.099
- She will.
- Molly.

15:19.150 --> 15:21.004
Well, we were actually hoping
that you would help us

15:21.050 --> 15:22.449
make that choice, Dr. Hammond.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.572
I-I can't do that.

15:23.620 --> 15:24.609
Oh, w-we're not talking

15:24.650 --> 15:25.844
about eeny meenie minie mo.

15:25.890 --> 15:28.586
Just more of an_informed
medical decmon.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.952
Okay. Well.. By the way,
you've been pregnant before?

15:30.990 --> 15:33.925
No. Answer the question, hon.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.928
- Uh, no.
- Good.

15:35.960 --> 15:40.260
Wow, you sure went to a lot of
schools for somebody so young.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.029
No wonder you come
so highly recommended.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.436
- Oh, who referred you?
- Alison Rollins.

15:44.470 --> 15:46.563
You may know her
as Alison DiLaurentis.

15:46.610 --> 15:47.668
[dramatic music]

15:47.710 --> 15:49.302
I understand you're
willing to work

15:49.340 --> 15:51.103
for an unusual arrangement.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.209
All cash, no questions asked.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.979
Okay, I'm not sure

15:55.020 --> 15:57.045
why you're here,
but I don't think

15:57.080 --> 15:58.240
it's for the right reasons.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.587
People do things for all sorts

15:59.620 --> 16:01.110
of reasons, don't they?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.151
I'm sure you had yours.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.928
Yeah. Ithink you need
to find another doctor.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.689
[music continues]

16:10.630 --> 16:12.120
[crow cawing]

16:19.640 --> 16:21.562
[squeaking]

16:25.950 --> 16:27.804
[dramatic music]

16:27.850 --> 16:29.738
Can I help you?

16:29.780 --> 16:32.317
[elevator bell rings]

16:32.350 --> 16:35.239
Oh, this was a stupid idea.

16:35.290 --> 16:38.282
Some ideas take longer
to execute than others, Emily.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.790
- You stole that?
- Mm-hmm.

16:44.830 --> 16:46.627
What's that supposed to tell us?

16:46.670 --> 16:48.126
His home address.

16:48.170 --> 16:51.196
Baby doc forgot to peel off
the mailing label.

16:51.240 --> 16:54.801
I doubt this is the most
personal piece of mail he gets.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.478
We're gonna do some digging.

16:56.510 --> 16:58.808
Look, lady, I don't mind
calling you a tow truck

16:58.850 --> 17:00.147
but I don't have any shovels.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.477
How is that possible?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.169
I mean, how do you plant
a tree without a shovel?

17:03.220 --> 17:06.109
I don't plant trees.
That's a different department.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.038
But if your vehicle
skidded off the road

17:08.090 --> 17:09.159
maybe we could find
something else.

17:09.190 --> 17:11.317
No, I just needed a shovel.

17:11.360 --> 17:14.056
I'm sorry. They took 'em.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.398
Who? W-what do you
mean "Took them?"

17:16.430 --> 17:17.795
Well, they were confiscated.

17:17.830 --> 17:19.969
I mean _it could've been
used In crIme or somethIng.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.968
They're running tests.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.197
So, we can find
something else here.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.559
Uh. Hey, how about this?

17:26.610 --> 17:29.602
Oh, try wedging this
beneath your...wheel.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.518
[sighs]

17:37.550 --> 17:40.485
[intense music]

17:47.030 --> 17:48.179
[beeps]

17:48.830 --> 17:49.797
[beeps]

17:52.400 --> 17:53.560
(female #1)
'Why are you calling me here?‘

17:53.600 --> 17:55.397
(Peter)
'You know why I'm calling you.'

17:55.440 --> 17:56.964
'You thought you
can pin this on me?‘

17:57.000 --> 17:58.934
(female #1)
'I could pin
a lot on you, Peter.‘

17:58.970 --> 18:02.098
(Peter)
'I think burying a dead body
in my yard is plenty.‘

18:04.040 --> 18:05.132
[phone ringing]

18:05.180 --> 18:07.444
- 'Hey.'
- Oh, you picked up.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.448
Where have you been?
I've called you like five times.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.971
- I know, I just..
- What's wrong?

18:12.020 --> 18:14.818
I'm staring at a burner phone
that was in a box

18:14.860 --> 18:17.852
that basically just
blew up my whole family.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.256
'They think I'm taking a turn
at the game without knowing it.'

18:20.290 --> 18:23.259
W—wait. What happened
with your family?

18:23.300 --> 18:25.188
My dad might have had more to do

18:25.230 --> 18:27.369
with Mrs. D's death
than we thought.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.924
'My mom's a wreck.‘

18:28.970 --> 18:32.736
'They both think that Mary Drake
made this special delivery.‘

18:32.770 --> 18:34.237
Is that what you think?

18:34.280 --> 18:37.602
I don't know _what to think.
I-I just"

18:37.650 --> 18:39.379
Mary wrote this letter
that makes me

18:39.410 --> 18:40.604
cry every time I look at it.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.402
I mean, how can this be
the same person?

18:42.450 --> 18:44.213
It just can't be.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.217
I'm gonna tell my mom
about the game.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.410
- 'I have to.‘
- No...don't.

18:50.460 --> 18:53.327
Just don't tell
your parents anything.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.782
We may be a lot closer
than you think.

18:54.830 --> 18:58.254
Just...just give Mona chance
to figure this out.

18:58.300 --> 19:01.963
Mona? We're gonna wait
for Mona to save us?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.934
She'd rather see us behind bars.

19:03.970 --> 19:05.392
She saved us before, Spencer.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.807
Just don't tell
your mother anything.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.979
I think talking about it
might just make it worse.

19:11.010 --> 19:12.739
But listen, I-I gotta go.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.774
Are you okay? Who was that?

19:18.820 --> 19:20.139
Uh, Spencer.

19:23.460 --> 19:26.952
Can I try and change your mood?

19:26.990 --> 19:31.427
I think I may have found
a song for our first dance.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.692
[instrumental music]

19:36.000 --> 19:38.434
Uh, please don't make
me dance right now.

19:38.470 --> 19:41.598
Okay. Okay, fine. We'll sway.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.303
Or j-just listen.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.809
- You hate it.
- No.

19:53.850 --> 19:56.387
No. It's sweet.
I like it. Ijust..

19:56.420 --> 19:58.786
Have reservations
about everythIng else.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.521
- What?
- Let's be honest.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.448
Aria, I know what
you were whispering

20:04.500 --> 20:06.923
on the phone with Spencer.

20:06.970 --> 20:09.393
There are things have been done
that can't be undone.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.762
And...can't be forgiven.

20:18.880 --> 20:19.847
[beeps]

20:23.580 --> 20:25.571
You still have doubts about me

20:25.620 --> 20:29.078
of whether you
can trust me or not?

20:29.120 --> 20:32.419
- Ezra.
- No-no. I-I get it.

20:32.460 --> 20:34.678
Maybe there's some part of you

20:34.730 --> 20:36.425
that has never forgiven me
for taking advantage

20:36.460 --> 20:38.223
of you and your friends
for the sake of a bark.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.328
Look, Ezra, that's--

20:39.370 --> 20:40.689
I wish that I
could change history

20:40.730 --> 20:42.266
but I can't.

20:43.370 --> 20:44.598
I fell in love with you, Aria.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.164
And this is where we are now.

20:46.210 --> 20:50.408
And I-I truly believe
that we are stronger

20:50.440 --> 20:52.647
for having weathered
those storms.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.249
Don't you?

21:03.390 --> 21:06.518
[dramatic music]

21:23.410 --> 21:26.277
Sorry, when did we go
from dating to stalking?

21:26.310 --> 21:27.902
I'm here to do a follow up.

21:27.950 --> 21:31.249
- More questions?
- It's my job.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.042
So, why are we in the middle
of the streets

21:33.090 --> 21:34.546
instead of down at the station?

21:34.590 --> 21:37.218
Ithought
you might be embarrassed.

21:37.260 --> 21:38.659
I hadn't realized until I spoke

21:38.690 --> 21:40.157
with Hanna's mother
the other night that you

21:40.190 --> 21:42.579
and Caleb Rivers' had ever been
more than friends.

21:42.630 --> 21:44.120
Why would that be embarrassing?

21:44.160 --> 21:47.425
Was he the reason that you
stopped with me that night

21:47.470 --> 21:48.664
in the elevator at the Radley?

21:48.700 --> 21:50.099
What relevance does that have?

21:50.140 --> 21:52.495
He'd have strong motive
to protect you, wouldn't he?

21:52.540 --> 21:54.963
I really hope you're not having
a hard time separating

21:55.010 --> 21:58.571
what's personal from what's
professional, Detective Furey?

21:58.610 --> 22:00.248
Given that I know how much value

22:00.280 --> 22:02.077
sticking to the letter
of the law.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.412
I have to go.

22:05.450 --> 22:06.815
I'm just curious.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.784
Your interest in me
have anythIng to do WIth you

22:08.820 --> 22:12.586
suddenly needing a cop
in your corner.

22:12.630 --> 22:15.087
If you have anything
real to ask me

22:15.130 --> 22:18.452
you can do it in your office,
under florescent lights.

22:18.500 --> 22:22.027
And I promise you, it will not
be me who's embarrassed.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.108
Why can't we talk out here?

23:05.150 --> 23:07.004
Please, let's go inside.

23:07.050 --> 23:09.245
I'm just more
comfortable out here.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.542
[sighs]

23:10.580 --> 23:15.119
How sad...that it's me
you're frightened of.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.651
Well, can you give me
a reason not to be?

23:18.960 --> 23:20.325
Why did you plant
this in my house?

23:20.360 --> 23:22.248
I didn't leave
that in your house.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.824
But I'm sorry you heard it.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.657
- So you know what's on here?
- 'I do.‘

23:25.700 --> 23:27.497
'I overheard it while I
was waItIng to see you.'

23:27.530 --> 23:30.499
I didn't know it was being
recorded at that time.

23:30.540 --> 23:32.360
The hospital
must have done that.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.105
They did lots of heinous things.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.131
Yeah, well, what about you?

23:36.180 --> 23:39.104
Possibly you did a few
heinous things yourself.

23:39.150 --> 23:40.606
Don't judge.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.075
You'd be surprised at the things

23:44.120 --> 23:46.441
you have to do sometimes
to protect yourself.

23:46.490 --> 23:48.685
[dramatic music]

23:51.390 --> 23:53.221
Where are they?

23:53.260 --> 23:56.184
Veronica took the girls
to New York for the weekend.

23:59.270 --> 24:02.865
Thank you for just
letting me in.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.703
Well, take a good look.

24:06.740 --> 24:10.608
'Cause it's the last time
you'll ever be allowed in here.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.347
You'll never see Spencer...ever.

24:13.380 --> 24:14.802
Please don't say that.

24:14.850 --> 24:17.068
She's one of the few
good things I've ever done.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.884
- Don't rob me.
- What was the good part?

24:19.920 --> 24:22.718
You tricking me into thinking
you were Jessica?

24:22.760 --> 24:25.285
You only did that to punish her
and take me down with her.

24:25.330 --> 24:27.628
You're not taking Spencer.

24:27.660 --> 24:30.891
You wanna know what's punishing?

24:30.930 --> 24:32.625
Who do you think
signed the papers

24:32.670 --> 24:34.968
that put me into a straitjacket?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.194

24:38.140 --> 24:40.005

care of this.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.970

24:46.010 --> 24:49.514
Those pills...that stopped
your sister's heart

24:49.550 --> 24:52.348
they were meant to stop yours.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.346
We shared the same DNA.

24:54.390 --> 24:56.517
The same medical conditions.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.357
And my father?

24:59.390 --> 25:01.688
To plot Jessica
with the medication.

25:03.800 --> 25:07.258
But I intercepted them.

25:07.300 --> 25:10.133
Finally, for once,
I stepped out of her shadow

25:10.170 --> 25:12.331
and stood out to my bully.

25:12.370 --> 25:14.531
I've been cheated out
of so much, Spencer.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.799
Most of all, knowing you.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.846
Do you wanna change that?

25:24.750 --> 25:27.787
Would you consider
staying with me?

25:27.820 --> 25:30.880
I've survived pretty well
underneath the radar.

25:30.920 --> 25:34.651

like a second chance for us.

Hey, where have you been? You
didn't answer any of my texts.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.982
My phone died. I drove all
the way over there for nothing.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.817
I mean, Furey already
has those shovels.

26:05.860 --> 26:07.384
- And God knows what else.
- Hanna!

26:07.430 --> 26:09.318
I spent the last four hours

26:09.360 --> 26:10.998
getting Lucas's car detailed.

26:11.030 --> 26:13.396
There's no way that they're
gonna find anything in there.

26:13.430 --> 26:14.829
I made him vacuum the ceiling.

26:14.870 --> 26:16.861
I made him clean the seat belt
with a Q-tip.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.765
- Hanna.
- Hello, stranger.

26:20.070 --> 26:24.871
Mom. Oh, my god,
I missed you so much.

26:24.910 --> 26:27.208
Um, I ordered some food
to pick up from Aria's.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.842
But your mom brought over
a nice bottle of wine.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.939
- Should we open that?
- Of course.

26:30.980 --> 26:34.245
Why were you detailing
Lucas's car?

26:34.290 --> 26:37.919
Uh, it's kind of been
my office on wheels.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.019
You know, making deliveries

26:40.060 --> 26:42.620
picking up fabrics,
eating meals..

26:42.660 --> 26:44.196
Really disgusting.

'Uh, Caleb, why don't you
get the nice wine glasses?‘

26:47.570 --> 26:50.232
So, has Emily moved out?

26:50.270 --> 26:52.807
Uh, she sort of
moved in with Alison.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.574
So, you two could live
here together?

26:57.610 --> 26:59.305
Well, when I'm not at the hotel.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.147
You know, as in, permanent.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.439
What...is..

27:05.490 --> 27:09.449
Um, I'm not sure I understand
what you're asking.

27:09.490 --> 27:12.379
Caleb, I'm happy you're back
in Hanna's life.

27:12.430 --> 27:16.992
I just wish I knew...why.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.562
Did Hanna need
your help with something?

27:20.600 --> 27:22.067
Mom. What are you doing?

27:22.100 --> 27:23.397
I'm standing right here,
don't ask.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.896
No. It's alright.

27:25.970 --> 27:28.063
They're good questions.

27:28.110 --> 27:33.742
The truth is, I'm here
because I needed Hanna's help.

27:33.780 --> 27:35.907
I needed to figure
some things out.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.311
Like how I felt about her.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.851
And I know that we drifted
apart for a little while

27:43.890 --> 27:46.688
and we almost ended up
with other people

27:46.730 --> 27:48.254
which would've been a disaster.

27:48.300 --> 27:52.828
Because...I would've spent
the next 50 years of my life

27:52.870 --> 27:54.519
kicking myself
for losing the best things

27:54.570 --> 27:56.094
that's ever happened to me.

27:59.040 --> 28:02.032
I can't imagine
my life without Hanna.

30:54.150 --> 30:56.141
- Daddyo!
- Daddyo!

30:56.180 --> 30:59.775
(all)
'Daddyo, Daddyo, Daddyo,
Daddyo, Daddyo.

30:59.820 --> 31:00.980
[clapping]

31:03.360 --> 31:05.681
(male #1)
'You all finished?‘

31:05.730 --> 31:07.925
Fine, Reggie got that audition..

31:12.030 --> 31:13.327
[cell phone buzzes]

31:25.110 --> 31:27.647
[soft music]

31:57.640 --> 31:58.607
[door opens]

32:00.880 --> 32:02.438
What're you doin' back here?

32:02.480 --> 32:05.278
We thought we hadn't finished
your interview with you.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.311
Yeah, I don't have
any answers for you.

32:07.350 --> 32:09.079
Oh, but you did have the cash

32:09.120 --> 32:11.918
to pay off a medical school
loan bill overnight.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.655
Shall I read you
the statement?

32:13.690 --> 32:15.248
You went through my mail?

32:15.300 --> 32:18.258
We have what you want,
you have what we want.

32:18.300 --> 32:19.824
Tell us the name
of Alison's donor daddy.

32:19.870 --> 32:21.019
I can't do that.

32:21.070 --> 32:22.526
Then tell us
who handed you the cash

32:22.570 --> 32:23.594
to make the transfer?

32:23.640 --> 32:25.665
Unless you'd rather tell
the state board.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.905
Look, no..

32:27.940 --> 32:29.805
I-I don't have names.

32:29.840 --> 32:30.909
Alright. I never did.

32:30.940 --> 32:32.009
I..

32:32.050 --> 32:34.245
It was all
handled electronically.

32:36.180 --> 32:39.047
All I can do is give you
the donor's ID number.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.614
We'll take it.

32:44.090 --> 32:45.250
[door opens]

32:46.660 --> 32:48.548
What's going on here?

32:48.600 --> 32:49.658
[door closes]

32:49.700 --> 32:50.997
Where did you get that?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.164
It was on the table.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.259
You know everything in here

33:00.310 --> 33:03.370
is just a manipulative ploy.

33:03.410 --> 33:04.934
- Peter--
- She'll suck you in.

33:04.980 --> 33:08.404
And before you know it, make you
share responsibility for all—-

33:08.450 --> 33:09.701
For what?

33:09.750 --> 33:13.208
For what you were willing
to do make her go away forever?

33:13.250 --> 33:14.786
I'm not gonna dignify that.

33:14.820 --> 33:16.287
Answer her question, Peter.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.288
What's the question?

33:18.320 --> 33:22.188
Did I try to protect my family
from a deranged sociopath

33:22.230 --> 33:24.528
who wanted to
shatter our lIves?

33:24.560 --> 33:26.551
Hell, yes!

33:26.600 --> 33:28.568
And I'd do it again.

33:34.710 --> 33:40.205
If someone continually
threatens you, Spencer..

33:40.250 --> 33:42.138
I don't think you'd do
anything different.

34:04.270 --> 34:07.159
Well, you can start
unpacking these boxes.

34:10.510 --> 34:11.408
Why?

34:11.440 --> 34:14.238
We're not going to Harrisburg.

34:14.280 --> 34:17.113
I'll make an announcement
In the mornIng.

34:17.150 --> 34:19.311
I'm forfeiting my senate seat.

34:19.350 --> 34:21.443
No, mom, you can't do that.

34:21.490 --> 34:23.242
You had nothing to
do with any of this.

34:23.290 --> 34:25.508
But I'm married _to
someone who dId.

34:26.590 --> 34:28.854
Spencer,
you know how these things work.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.892
How can I take that job when
I'll just be treading water

34:31.930 --> 34:34.990
waiting for the shark
to take another bite.

34:35.030 --> 34:37.430
I guess some dreams
were meant to be just that.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.229
Dreams.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.249
(Spencer)
Mom, Mary..

34:47.280 --> 34:49.544
She didn't bring that
recording into this house.

34:50.980 --> 34:53.517
She's not out to hurt us.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.609
Really?

34:55.660 --> 34:57.218
Then who did?

34:58.530 --> 34:59.485
VVhois?

35:31.060 --> 35:32.379
[sighs]

35:53.850 --> 35:55.169
[owl hoots]

35:56.580 --> 35:57.717
[sighs]

36:01.050 --> 36:02.915
- You found me.
- Yeah, barely.

36:04.260 --> 36:05.488
Oh.

36:07.030 --> 36:08.725
Why are we here?

36:09.960 --> 36:12.292
Well, when I dropped your mom
off at the hotel

36:12.330 --> 36:14.366
the staff was giving me
the hairy eyeball.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.437
Probably they all work
for Detective Furey now.

36:17.470 --> 36:19.893
Better to be off the grid.

36:19.940 --> 36:21.168
What's in the bag?

36:21.870 --> 36:23.406
Stuff.

36:27.510 --> 36:29.944
Did you really mean
what you said?

36:31.120 --> 36:32.473
What?

36:33.320 --> 36:34.548
To my mom.

36:37.460 --> 36:39.155
- Did you really..
- Hanna.

36:39.190 --> 36:40.782
I need to know.

36:40.830 --> 36:43.526
Because I don't know if you
said it just to distract her..

36:43.560 --> 36:45.027
Hanna.

36:45.060 --> 36:46.459
I would marry you
right this second

36:46.500 --> 36:48.263
if we could find a bear
who's licensed.

36:48.300 --> 36:49.824
[chuckles]

36:50.870 --> 36:52.189
[laughs]

36:57.610 --> 36:58.736
[sighs]

37:01.550 --> 37:06.044
I didn't know
what I was looking for

37:06.090 --> 37:07.978
Uh, whoa!

37:08.020 --> 37:09.180
When did you pick up this habit?

37:09.220 --> 37:10.448
[chuckles]

37:10.490 --> 37:12.082
Well, I came prepared.

37:12.130 --> 37:14.223
Just in case.

37:15.030 --> 37:17.521
[soft rock song]

37:39.590 --> 37:42.013
When can I kiss the bride?

37:42.060 --> 37:43.857
Now.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.987
[song continues]

38:14.350 --> 38:18.514
I'm so happy to see you.
I'm glad you came.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.380
Did you tell them
that you were leaving?

38:20.430 --> 38:21.954
Do they know you're with me?

38:23.100 --> 38:24.419
No.

38:25.670 --> 38:26.796
Good.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.625
You're packed lightly.

38:29.670 --> 38:31.160
Are the rest of your things
in your car?

38:31.200 --> 38:32.895
I'm not going with you.

38:34.940 --> 38:37.272
I thought you were
ready to leave this town.

38:37.310 --> 38:39.005
Iam.

38:40.680 --> 38:43.069
I just..

38:43.120 --> 38:45.042
I can't leave the people in it.

38:46.820 --> 38:48.811
My friends need me,
and H need them

38:48.860 --> 38:51.010
and I can't walk away
from my parents right now.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.084
Especially not my mom.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.415
She's..

38:53.460 --> 38:54.654
I'm sorry.

38:54.690 --> 38:56.829
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't apologize.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.691
She is your mother.

39:00.730 --> 39:02.425
And you are lucky to
have her.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.604
Do you know who delivered
that recording to your house?

39:12.280 --> 39:13.599
No.

39:15.010 --> 39:17.342
But at least now
I know that it wasn't you.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.117
I hope you can forgive me.

39:25.260 --> 39:26.750
I already have.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.721
But you need to
forgive yourself.

39:39.140 --> 39:40.459
[sighs]

39:43.510 --> 39:45.728
[breathing heavily]

39:47.350 --> 39:48.703
[clacks]

40:15.310 --> 40:16.629
[buzzing]

40:41.970 --> 40:44.188
Emily? What're you doing here?

40:44.240 --> 40:46.060
Hold on. This is from Spencer.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.634
A.D. left it in her house
and we're hoping

40:47.670 --> 40:49.206
you can find something
on here to help us.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.571
Where's Caleb when you need 'em?

40:50.610 --> 40:52.430
He and Hanna
aren't answerIng theIr phones.

40:53.410 --> 40:55.105
Give it.

40:55.150 --> 40:56.742
Just be careful, okay?

40:56.780 --> 40:58.338
You really need
to watch your step.

40:58.380 --> 40:59.779
No taken.

40:59.820 --> 41:01.117
Wait.

41:01.150 --> 41:03.744
I also think I narrowed down
the agency that the--

41:03.790 --> 41:05.849
Tomorrow, hon,
it's been a wicked long day.

41:05.890 --> 41:07.426
Some of us need our beauty rest.

41:07.460 --> 41:08.688
Could I at least show you
on your laptop?

41:08.730 --> 41:09.924
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

41:09.960 --> 41:11.120
Goodnight.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.479
[keys clacking]

42:14.130 --> 42:15.256
[theme music]
