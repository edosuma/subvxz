00:12.667 --> 00:14.987
They called it the phoney war.

00:15.027 --> 00:17.987
A war where nothing happened.

00:18.027 --> 00:20.845
But now, across this green
and pleasant land,

00:20.870 --> 00:25.387
young men are preparing to see
just how real war can be.

00:27.467 --> 00:32.827
I'd call them brave, but only time
will tell how true that is.

00:35.867 --> 00:39.547
What we know for sure is that
the events of the past few weeks

00:39.587 --> 00:41.867
have been anything but phony.

00:46.907 --> 00:50.307
Bombs over Rotterdam
and the Dutch are surrendering.

00:50.347 --> 00:54.227
German tanks crossing
the Maginot Line into France.

00:54.267 --> 00:58.147
And in old London town
the tension is rising.

00:58.187 --> 01:03.587
As a nation asks itself,
will we be next?

01:04.608 --> 01:08.427
Today, a great man
is laid to rest.

01:08.467 --> 01:11.507
We are lucky to have served
under him.

01:11.547 --> 01:13.987
Lord Hamilton.

01:14.027 --> 01:16.107
Lord Hamilton.

01:19.667 --> 01:23.427
But the world has changed,
the future is uncertain.

01:23.467 --> 01:28.627
And in the opinion of this humble
reporter, before things get better,

01:28.667 --> 01:31.427
they're going to get a lot worse.

01:35.147 --> 01:36.947
What's she doing here?

01:41.107 --> 01:43.347
Miss. Lambert, wait.

01:48.507 --> 01:50.667
I just came to pay my respects.

01:50.707 --> 01:53.187
That would be a very bad idea,
Miss. Lambert.

02:07.147 --> 02:10.067
We need to discuss the future
of your father's hotel.

02:10.107 --> 02:13.547
It's time to make some changes.

03:10.307 --> 03:14.547
When can we expect to see you make
your debut in the House of Lords?

03:14.587 --> 03:17.827
Well there's the little matter
of the war to attend to first.

03:17.867 --> 03:21.987
Of course. Your father
would be very proud of you.

03:22.027 --> 03:24.667
You too, Toby.

03:27.187 --> 03:29.027
Freddie.

03:31.907 --> 03:34.587
I understand from Sir Cyril
that you aren't needed at the base

03:34.627 --> 03:36.947
until next week.
But you have compassionate leave.

03:36.987 --> 03:38.627
I don't need any leave.

03:38.667 --> 03:41.307
You have responsibilities now.

03:41.347 --> 03:44.507
There are things that must be done.
I'm sure Toby can deal with them.

03:44.547 --> 03:48.107
You're the older brother. Unless I imagined
that father left you his entire estate.

03:48.147 --> 03:50.467
- I never asked for it.
- Stop it, both of you, please.

03:50.507 --> 03:52.747
Freddie, I need to talk to you.

04:03.547 --> 04:06.907
All I am asking for is some help.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.027
And you can't even give me that.

04:09.067 --> 04:11.027
I'm not doing this to upset you.

04:11.067 --> 04:14.027
Everyone knew.

04:14.067 --> 04:16.827
About your father and that whore.

04:16.867 --> 04:19.867
I can't do all this on my own.

04:19.906 --> 04:25.907
I need you, for once in your bloody
life, to be a son to me. Help me.

04:27.387 --> 04:29.427
Please, I need your help.

04:45.107 --> 04:46.027
I'm glad you're here,

04:46.066 --> 04:49.488
there were some things
I wanted to discuss with you.

04:49.513 --> 04:53.667
No, this isn't a good time for that.

04:57.387 --> 05:00.667
I've been instructed to tell you
that we're letting you go.

05:02.987 --> 05:06.307
That you can work until
the end of the month and then...

05:11.853 --> 05:15.759
Freddie, right now your
mother is angry...

05:15.784 --> 05:16.784
You have no idea.

05:16.947 --> 05:20.507
But you and I both know this would
be bad for the hotel.

05:20.547 --> 05:23.507
- She's using you.
- So, what do you suggest I do?

05:23.547 --> 05:25.747
Return to my mother,
my grieving mother,

05:25.787 --> 05:28.107
and tell her that I stand
with you instead?

05:28.147 --> 05:30.707
Your father new stability was key.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.151
I'm sorry, Mr. Garland,
but I have no interest

05:34.176 --> 05:36.627
in looking over this place
the way my father did.

05:36.667 --> 05:40.227
There's a war coming. I have
my squadron and I have my duty.

05:40.267 --> 05:42.907
This, here, is not my battle.
I'm sorry.

05:48.227 --> 05:50.667
I'm not worried.
Well, you should be.

05:50.707 --> 05:53.587
She's never run a hotel.
She doesn't understand how it works.

05:53.627 --> 05:56.667
I just have to make her realise
the value I bring.

05:56.707 --> 05:59.427
You are familiar with the phrase
"hell hath no fury"?

05:59.467 --> 06:02.707
Afternoon, Mr. Garland, Mrs. Taylor,
Mr. Feldman.

06:02.747 --> 06:04.507
Afternoon, Kate.

06:06.507 --> 06:08.427
I will deal with her Ladyship.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.846
I would appreciate you both
keeping this to yourselves,

06:10.871 --> 06:13.787
I don't want Emma to know.
It's business as usual.

06:13.827 --> 06:15.947
Is it true?

06:17.787 --> 06:20.707
The Officer's Dance tomorrow night.

06:20.747 --> 06:23.827
They say that you've got
Robert Bentley compering.

06:23.867 --> 06:25.627
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs, that's correct.

06:25.667 --> 06:29.227
All my bloody dreams
come true at once.

06:29.267 --> 06:32.187
He's just an actor.
Not even that handsome.

06:49.587 --> 06:51.187
There you are.

06:51.227 --> 06:53.107
Can I help you, sir?

06:53.147 --> 06:56.067
Max Klein. From the agency.

06:56.107 --> 06:58.747
Yes, Klein. Kitchen porter.

06:58.787 --> 07:01.747
Billy, kindly show Mr. Klein
to the kitchen.

07:01.787 --> 07:05.747
Yes. You can't use the front door
next time, you gotta use the back.

07:05.787 --> 07:07.627
Of course.

07:07.667 --> 07:12.827
Is he...? He's Austrian. Kitchen.
Out of the way. Won't be a problem.

07:22.347 --> 07:26.387
Sonny's under the weather,
which means I've got the night off

07:26.427 --> 07:28.827
and you and I are hitting the town.

07:28.867 --> 07:32.387
I want to make sure Freddie
is all right first.

07:32.427 --> 07:35.547
I haven't managed to see him at all,
it's almost like he's avoiding me.

07:35.587 --> 07:39.627
It's not Freddie any more. It's
Lord Hamilton. Things have changed.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.987
- It's just a title.
- Do you think, if I was Lady Day,

07:43.027 --> 07:46.107
you'd see me hanging around
dodgy pubs and clubs

07:46.147 --> 07:48.907
- drinking until all hours?
- Yes, probably.

07:48.947 --> 07:51.547
You could be my lady in waiting.

07:51.587 --> 07:55.307
Freddie will see you
when he wants to see you.

07:55.347 --> 08:00.507
Until then, we are going
to have some fun.

08:00.547 --> 08:04.509
We've got cold storage there,
hot plates there.

08:04.534 --> 08:08.947
This is a spoon, this is a knife.

08:08.987 --> 08:10.827
Thank you, Mr. Robbie.

08:10.867 --> 08:12.627
Stop!

08:15.907 --> 08:17.587
Say that again.

08:17.627 --> 08:22.067
I said thank you, Mr. Robbie.

08:22.107 --> 08:24.547
Bloody hell!

08:24.587 --> 08:29.707
The agency's only gone and sent me
a bloody German.

08:29.747 --> 08:31.667
I think Mr. Klein is from Austria.

08:31.707 --> 08:33.746
I don't care what you think.

08:33.787 --> 08:38.187
Well then, I got my eye on you,
Fritz.

08:38.227 --> 08:41.227
Wee bit harsh, chef.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.626
Now the bloody Scotch
is telling me

08:43.667 --> 08:45.947
what to say to the bloody Fritz.

08:45.987 --> 08:49.547
And to think, chef, I was gonna
invite you to the Cafe De Paris

08:49.587 --> 08:51.747
with us.
But not with that attitude.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.827
Everyone else is welcome to join,
though!

08:55.867 --> 08:58.547
All right, all right, back to work!

08:58.587 --> 08:59.165
Chop, chop!

08:59.190 --> 09:01.517
Let's get the plates through.
Hurry up.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.347
Ma'am. I'm not sure
you should be here.

09:05.387 --> 09:09.467
What are you going to do, Mr. Feldman?
Manhandle me?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.987
Lambert.

09:21.427 --> 09:24.827
You want to know that he was being
honest with you?

09:24.867 --> 09:29.227
That he really cared for you
and that he loved you?

09:29.267 --> 09:32.107
I suppose so. You silly girl.

09:32.147 --> 09:33.827
Of course he was lying to you.

09:33.867 --> 09:35.707
You were nothing to him
but a piece of meat.

09:35.747 --> 09:38.547
You want the first, certainly
wouldn't have been the last.

09:38.587 --> 09:41.027
Feeling better now?

09:41.067 --> 09:43.707
He lied to you as well, then,
didn't he?

09:43.747 --> 09:46.347
Over and over...

09:46.387 --> 09:48.507
Miss. Lambert.

09:49.827 --> 09:52.347
You are not welcome here.
I believe I made that clear.

09:52.387 --> 09:54.507
Mr. Skinner, please escort her
out the back.

09:54.547 --> 09:57.027
I offered you an olive branch,
Priscilla.

09:58.707 --> 10:03.787
One day you will look back and you
will wonder why you didn't take it.

10:07.827 --> 10:10.787
I apologise for the intrusion,
Lady Hamilton.

10:14.467 --> 10:21.067
Look at you. Just a... walking
reminder of my husband's failings.

10:21.107 --> 10:24.227
I do also know how to run
this hotel.

10:24.267 --> 10:26.267
And how to keep it running.

10:26.307 --> 10:28.387
Yes, and a madam knows
how to run a brothel.

10:28.427 --> 10:31.427
I'm not sure it's something
to be proud of.

10:31.467 --> 10:34.107
You have houses in the country.

10:34.147 --> 10:37.187
Staff, costs, overheads.

10:37.227 --> 10:40.027
This place is the only thing
that brings you revenue.

10:40.067 --> 10:42.187
Mr. Garland,
are you trying to educate me?

10:42.227 --> 10:44.707
I'm trying to help you.

10:44.747 --> 10:48.547
If I wish, I could walk into a
top job at any hotel in this city.

10:48.587 --> 10:51.427
Well then...

10:54.307 --> 10:56.587
I suggest you start walking.

11:09.951 --> 11:12.071
This place is incredible.

11:35.471 --> 11:38.511
Is it hot in here or is it just me?

11:40.007 --> 11:42.391
Let me introduce our special guest.

11:42.431 --> 11:46.831
He's an emperor of the ivories,
Mr. Sonny Sullivan.

11:48.911 --> 11:52.551
That little bugger.

11:52.591 --> 11:54.351
He's not ill.

11:54.391 --> 11:56.071
Come on, let's get a drink.

11:56.111 --> 12:00.231
Good idea. I'll chuck one over him
when he gets off stage.

12:09.151 --> 12:11.711
The English are famous for
their politeness.

12:11.751 --> 12:15.711
But just because you are tolerated
does not mean you are liked.

12:15.751 --> 12:18.071
Or even welcome.

12:18.111 --> 12:20.711
I thought bartenders were
meant to be impartial.

12:20.751 --> 12:22.751
You may be confusing us
with Switzerland.

12:22.791 --> 12:24.832
- Mr. O'Hara, may I talk to you?
- Sure.

12:24.856 --> 12:26.833
But, Toby, come on, call me Joe.

12:26.911 --> 12:29.511
Thank you.

12:39.471 --> 12:41.911
- Does anybody else know?
- What?

12:41.951 --> 12:44.471
That it was me that told you
about my father and Charity?

12:44.511 --> 12:46.351
No, of course not.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.231
Good.

12:49.540 --> 12:52.311
That's it?
That's what you're worried about?

12:52.351 --> 12:56.673
I figured you'd at least want to
tear some strips off me.

12:56.713 --> 12:58.833
My father was a hypocrite.

12:58.873 --> 13:02.557
Talking about patriotism and duty
while still running

13:02.582 --> 13:05.026
business interests in Germany?
Legality be damned!

13:05.051 --> 13:06.633
Jesus, Toby!

13:06.673 --> 13:11.793
You can't say those kind of things,
especially not to me.

13:11.833 --> 13:17.473
The last thing he ever said to me
was that I was pathetic.

13:20.673 --> 13:22.913
That my life was useless.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.313
He never had any time for me.

13:28.353 --> 13:31.633
And I don't see how his death
changes anything.

13:46.156 --> 13:48.892
Richard, you know how I feel
about you.

13:48.932 --> 13:54.892
You're gifted, qualified,
a boon to any establishment.

13:54.931 --> 13:59.331
But Lady Hamilton has friends.
She has influence.

13:59.371 --> 14:02.009
She's not afraid to use either.

14:02.034 --> 14:04.064
So, what are you saying?

14:04.089 --> 14:07.211
This isn't the first place
you've tried, is it?

14:08.856 --> 14:11.096
There won't be a job for you here.

14:11.136 --> 14:13.976
Or anywhere, to be honest.

14:14.016 --> 14:19.056
Look, I have done you favours
in the past...

14:19.096 --> 14:22.656
She's aristocracy.
You're management.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.016
What did you think
was going to happen?

14:25.056 --> 14:29.136
Whatever you did to upset her,
it was a big mistake.

14:29.176 --> 14:32.776
You've made yourself a
very powerful enemy.

15:06.256 --> 15:08.736
- Is she better than me?
- Are you jealous?

15:08.776 --> 15:13.176
What? No, I just think it's highly
unprofessional of Sonny.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.696
Of course.

15:15.736 --> 15:19.536
You don't see me singing with any
piano player who bats his eyes at me.

15:19.576 --> 15:24.696
Besides, it's unfair, I always wanted
to play the Cafe De Paris.

15:24.736 --> 15:26.854
Definitely not jealous, then.

15:33.416 --> 15:35.456
It's Freddie.

15:37.456 --> 15:39.136
Let him come to you.

15:39.176 --> 15:41.256
I don't want to play games.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.456
You're not.

15:44.496 --> 15:48.736
You haven't got time when you're
dancing with Captain Cheekbones here.

15:48.776 --> 15:51.896
- Actually, I'm a private.
- Shut up and take her dancing.

16:05.176 --> 16:07.096
You call that clean?!

16:07.136 --> 16:09.016
Chef!

16:09.056 --> 16:13.136
I cannot work with this man
in the kitchen.

16:13.176 --> 16:16.216
- Tell the agency to take him back.
- On what grounds?

16:16.256 --> 16:20.696
On the grounds that I will not have
a German in my bloody kitchen.

16:20.736 --> 16:22.456
Just as well he's from Austria.

16:22.496 --> 16:25.176
Yeah, like his good friend,
the Fuhrer.

16:25.216 --> 16:28.616
Look at him, for all we know he's
on the phone every night to Berlin.

16:28.656 --> 16:31.016
He's a refugee chef, not a spy.

16:31.056 --> 16:34.256
Look, I understand you want to
do your bit for the war effort, chef,

16:34.296 --> 16:37.496
but, please,
try not to kill any staff.

16:37.536 --> 16:40.016
We are running short as it is.

16:40.056 --> 16:43.456
Hey, hey, hey.
You may run this hotel,

16:43.496 --> 16:45.816
but you do not run this kitchen.

16:47.216 --> 16:49.616
Do you think this is the only problem
I have today, chef?

16:49.656 --> 16:52.096
Because it is not. Not even close.

16:52.136 --> 16:56.376
So I am warning you,
today is not the day to test me.

17:08.496 --> 17:10.536
What are you all gawping at?!

17:10.576 --> 17:12.536
Get back to work!

17:17.415 --> 17:19.296
I'm not saying you can't hit chef,

17:19.336 --> 17:21.935
we've all wanted to hit chef
at one point or another.

17:21.976 --> 17:23.656
But we are worried about ya.

17:23.695 --> 17:25.856
You've never shouted at staff
like that before.

17:25.896 --> 17:28.415
There's nothing for me out there.
Nothing.

17:28.455 --> 17:32.256
Her Ladyship blames me
for her husband's indiscretions.

17:32.296 --> 17:34.816
She's made sure I'm a... pariah.

17:34.856 --> 17:38.016
I did try to warn ya. You've got a
little nest egg, though?

17:38.056 --> 17:39.856
Set aside, keep you warm.

17:43.256 --> 17:46.256
I'd only just managed
to get out of debt.

17:46.296 --> 17:49.296
Me and Jim have a little put aside.

17:49.336 --> 17:53.216
Peggy, Peggy, please, don't be silly.

17:53.256 --> 17:55.336
You can stay in my basement.

17:55.376 --> 17:57.416
It's a bit damp, mind.

17:57.456 --> 17:59.696
- There might be rats down there.
- No!

17:59.736 --> 18:01.496
Maybe something bigger than a rat.

18:01.536 --> 18:05.976
Anyway, point is, I'll roll up my
sleeves and give it a proper clean.

18:06.016 --> 18:08.376
I will find a way out of this.

18:08.416 --> 18:11.536
She's doing this for sport. She's
not gonna change her mind, Richard.

18:11.576 --> 18:14.576
Peggy's right. You've got to
think about your future.

18:29.736 --> 18:32.536
Sorry, do you mind if I step in?

18:32.576 --> 18:35.496
- Be my guest.
- Hello, you look nice.

18:35.536 --> 18:39.175
- Sonny, play a slow one.
- Bets...

18:39.199 --> 18:40.355
Just play a slow one.

18:40.456 --> 18:43.296
Blue Jasmine. Blue Jasmine, ready?

18:43.336 --> 18:45.936
One, two, three.

18:53.096 --> 18:55.656
I was just having a few drinks
with my squadron.

18:55.696 --> 18:56.539
It's all right.

18:56.564 --> 18:59.157
Well, I know, I know, I should be
at home with my family but...

18:59.216 --> 19:01.216
Freddie, I understand.

19:01.256 --> 19:04.016
Betsy's pretty angry.

19:04.056 --> 19:05.976
And you're not?

19:06.016 --> 19:08.056
Well, there's no point
in overreacting.

19:08.096 --> 19:11.856
She thinks it's a total betrayal.
Stabbed in the back.

19:11.896 --> 19:14.736
It wasn't my choice.

19:14.776 --> 19:16.456
I know that.

19:16.496 --> 19:18.656
I was just trying to be a good son.

19:18.696 --> 19:20.416
Freddie, what are you talking about?

19:23.696 --> 19:25.936
I'm talking about your father.

19:25.976 --> 19:27.976
Who were you talking about?

19:28.016 --> 19:29.696
Sonny.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.936
What do you mean by my father?

19:31.976 --> 19:34.896
It's fine.
It... it really doesn't matter.

19:34.936 --> 19:38.336
It does. Freddie, what's going on?

19:38.376 --> 19:41.496
- I had to let him go, it wasn't my...
- You fired my father?

19:41.536 --> 19:43.216
Emma. Please, just...

19:43.256 --> 19:44.935
- Bloody hell.
- My mother told me to.

19:44.959 --> 19:45.303
Emma!

19:45.357 --> 19:47.592
- Don't talk to me. Listen to me.
- How could you do that?

19:47.616 --> 19:50.336
- How could you do that to my family?
- Emma, please!

19:50.376 --> 19:52.616
Emma!

20:02.817 --> 20:06.137
Robert Bentley will give a brief,
rousing speech to the troops.

20:06.177 --> 20:08.417
Am I supposed to know who he is?

20:08.457 --> 20:10.457
He graces the silver screen.

20:10.497 --> 20:12.697
Was he expensive?

20:12.737 --> 20:15.737
You'd be surprised what happens
when you mention patriotism.

20:15.777 --> 20:18.577
How very enterprising of you.

20:18.617 --> 20:21.697
And how is the job search going?

20:21.737 --> 20:24.817
- Very well, thank you.
- Pleased to hear it.

20:27.377 --> 20:30.777
There was one question I had.

20:30.817 --> 20:36.017
Please, I'm an open book.

20:36.057 --> 20:41.457
When you've punished me
and when you've ruined this place,

20:41.497 --> 20:43.617
when you've done all that,

20:43.657 --> 20:47.137
do you think somehow it will
alleviate this pain you feel?

20:47.177 --> 20:50.017
That things will be better?

20:50.057 --> 20:52.857
I don't know.

20:52.897 --> 20:56.017
I suppose I'll find out.

21:19.537 --> 21:21.537
When were you going to tell me?

21:21.612 --> 21:22.245
Em...

21:22.291 --> 21:27.737
They ask you to leave and what,
you don't trust me or how I'd react?

21:27.777 --> 21:30.577
I wanted to protect you.

21:30.617 --> 21:34.055
Please, understand this will not
affect you.

21:34.125 --> 21:38.177
Of course it will affect me!
This is our home.

21:38.217 --> 21:41.537
I can't believe Freddie would do
such a thing.

21:41.577 --> 21:44.337
He's under a lot of pressure
from his family.

21:45.317 --> 21:48.114
- I don't... I don't blame him.
- Don't defend him.

21:50.577 --> 21:56.217
Emma, you are the most important
thing in the world to me.

21:56.257 --> 21:59.537
And whatever happens, I'm going to
make sure you're looked after.

22:00.225 --> 22:03.337
How? How are you going to do that?

22:04.861 --> 22:08.564
How are you even going to
look after yourself?

22:53.257 --> 22:55.457
Thank you for coming to meet me.

22:55.497 --> 22:57.897
It's probably good for me
to get out of the hotel.

22:57.937 --> 23:00.777
I'm about as popular there
as you are.

23:03.457 --> 23:05.377
Then you will help me?

23:05.417 --> 23:07.897
Not sure I follow, Miss. Lambert.

23:07.937 --> 23:12.657
Lawrence lied to me, over and over.

23:12.697 --> 23:15.577
And they... they think I'm a joke.

23:15.617 --> 23:19.857
Some pathetic creature that can be
mocked and cast aside.

23:27.457 --> 23:29.137
Well...

23:33.777 --> 23:36.177
I'm going to prove them wrong.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.617
That's heartbreaking stuff.

23:40.657 --> 23:43.577
I still don't see what it's got
to do with me.

23:45.657 --> 23:47.937
Have a seat and I'll tell you.

23:55.097 --> 23:56.977
I have to go out for a few hours.

23:57.017 --> 23:59.657
While I'm gone I'll need you to
look after tonight's event.

23:59.697 --> 24:01.923
- Me?
- You are more than capable.

24:01.948 --> 24:04.714
Mr. Reynolds, can you spare my
daughter for a while.

24:05.977 --> 24:09.457
So, turns out it was a badger.

24:09.497 --> 24:12.977
You ever heard one scream?
It's like, "".

24:13.017 --> 24:15.417
Little bugger scared the bejesus
out of me.

24:15.457 --> 24:18.257
Still, if you need a bed.

24:18.297 --> 24:23.217
I do appreciate the offer, but er...
hopefully that won't be necessary.

24:23.257 --> 24:25.577
What have you got up your sleeve?

24:35.337 --> 24:37.057
Robbie, what happened?

24:37.097 --> 24:39.657
He got locked up
in the cold storage.

24:39.697 --> 24:42.297
What? Who did that?
Who do you think?

24:42.337 --> 24:45.817
Chef can torment me all he wants.
I will not quit.

24:45.857 --> 24:48.697
I ran my kitchens on respect
and understanding.

24:48.737 --> 24:53.297
You worked as a chef before?
Hotel Imperial, Vienna.

24:53.337 --> 24:55.537
The Imperial? That's a five-star.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.737
Who did you train under before?
Tobias Wilmer.

24:58.777 --> 25:02.617
Chef Wilmer.
The Royal Hotel, Salzburg.

25:02.657 --> 25:06.057
Chef Muller was at the Royal.
Wilmer was at the Albertina.

25:06.097 --> 25:09.457
But I appreciate your attempts
to trick me.

25:09.497 --> 25:13.017
So, how come you ended up here?

25:13.057 --> 25:17.537
The Fuhrer chose the Imperial to
address the crowds at the Anschluss.

25:17.577 --> 25:19.417
My family had already fled
to France,

25:19.457 --> 25:21.657
but the only passage I could find
was to here.

25:21.697 --> 25:24.337
And because it was the only job
I could get...

25:24.377 --> 25:28.097
I'll have a word with chef.
No, that will just make it worse.

25:28.137 --> 25:31.897
Besides, I escaped Austria to run
from one angry little man.

25:31.937 --> 25:34.737
I will not let another drive me out.

25:37.697 --> 25:39.777
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

25:39.817 --> 25:44.297
It's so unfair. And he worked
so hard to get out of debt.

25:44.337 --> 25:46.417
You don't think you do
something stupid, do you?

25:46.457 --> 25:50.137
Normally, no,
but under the circumstances...

25:52.657 --> 25:54.777
I think I might know
where he's gone.

25:54.817 --> 25:58.017
Halcyon.

26:28.177 --> 26:30.977
No more bets. Black 35.

26:37.177 --> 26:39.337
Place your bets.

26:39.377 --> 26:44.177
Please go in.
Good evening, sir, good evening.

26:44.217 --> 26:46.361
- Welcome to the Officers Dance.
- Last night...

26:46.393 --> 26:47.034
Don't.

26:47.097 --> 26:51.017
You don't owe me anything.
Much less an explanation.

26:51.057 --> 26:53.177
Emma, I know I've made mistakes.

26:53.217 --> 26:55.377
It's just everything changed
so quickly.

26:55.417 --> 26:59.457
I went from being normal to having
all of these responsibilities

26:59.497 --> 27:02.574
and pressures of the title
forced upon me.

27:02.637 --> 27:04.073
Normal is worrying about
paying the bills,

27:04.097 --> 27:05.977
about scraping by
to the end of the week.

27:06.017 --> 27:08.137
You have no idea what normal is.

27:10.537 --> 27:13.417
No, you're right. I don't.

27:13.457 --> 27:18.177
I just want you to know, about
your father, it's not my decision.

27:18.217 --> 27:22.537
No. You don't want it to be
your decision.

27:22.577 --> 27:24.977
That's not the same thing.

27:25.017 --> 27:27.577
Freddie!

27:31.657 --> 27:33.977
Robert Bentley's agent
just telephoned.

27:34.017 --> 27:36.137
Finally. Where is he? The Cotswolds.

27:36.177 --> 27:38.217
He's...

27:38.257 --> 27:40.697
He said he was worried London
would be attacked.

27:40.737 --> 27:42.697
It's five minutes to show time.

27:54.897 --> 27:57.617
You want me to step in?
I know it's short notice.

27:57.657 --> 28:01.177
That's one way of putting it, yeah.
So, what's in it for me?

28:03.617 --> 28:08.817
It's Friday night, Mr. O'Hara.
And you're in your room alone.

28:08.857 --> 28:11.137
Ever since your broadcast
about the hotel,

28:11.177 --> 28:13.457
most people around here
are ignoring you.

28:13.497 --> 28:16.377
- Whatever you say, that must sting.
- And?

28:16.417 --> 28:19.937
And you have a chance to walk out
in front of a crowd of people...

28:19.977 --> 28:23.657
Right, yeah, I got the gist
of it. That was a good speech.

28:23.697 --> 28:26.977
Did you rehearse that
coming up in the elevator?

28:27.017 --> 28:29.697
A little.

28:29.737 --> 28:32.737
So, will you help or not?

28:34.857 --> 28:37.657
Are you in?

28:46.497 --> 28:48.297
Place your bets!

28:55.337 --> 28:57.057
Black 28.

29:04.697 --> 29:06.577
Well, my father was a soldier.

29:06.617 --> 29:09.537
First infantry. Fought at Ypres.

29:09.577 --> 29:12.577
He told me that British soldiers,

29:12.617 --> 29:16.377
well, British soldiers
are pretty strange.

29:18.457 --> 29:21.817
He said that you guys ate
the worst food he's ever tasted.

29:21.857 --> 29:24.657
That you thought nothing of pausing
during a firefight

29:24.697 --> 29:26.817
for a cigarette and a cup of tea.

29:26.857 --> 29:28.777
And you'd stick a Jerry
with a bayonet

29:28.817 --> 29:30.737
and apologise whilst doing it.

29:30.777 --> 29:34.057
And he also told me this:

29:35.017 --> 29:37.497
That there is nobody in this world

29:37.522 --> 29:40.257
that he would rather
fight alongside.

29:40.297 --> 29:44.217
And do you know what?
He was damn right!

29:49.256 --> 29:53.256
Now, tonight is for you.
So enjoy yourselves!

29:59.016 --> 30:01.296
Thank you.

30:04.722 --> 30:06.871
I didn't realise your father
fought in the war.

30:06.896 --> 30:11.069
My father's a farmer.
He's never even left Illinois.

30:20.470 --> 30:22.190
Place your bets!

30:24.990 --> 30:27.150
Mr. Garland, enough now!

30:27.190 --> 30:31.070
I need to make sure that Emma
is looked after.

30:31.110 --> 30:33.550
You risk losing it all.

30:39.086 --> 30:41.110
All bets are final.

31:06.910 --> 31:10.430
All these soldiers, but how many will
come back home in one piece?

31:10.470 --> 31:15.110
Gentlemen, please. What is it
they say? Eat, drink and be merry.

31:15.150 --> 31:16.830
Yes, for tomorrow we die.

31:16.870 --> 31:19.670
- Maybe not the best quote.
- No.

31:21.870 --> 31:23.590
Talk to her, Freddie.

31:23.630 --> 31:25.830
No, I've blown it.

31:28.470 --> 31:31.070
Apologies for the interruption,
Lord Hamilton.

31:31.110 --> 31:33.350
Very funny, Toby. This is my brother.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.350
The younger brother.
The less important one.

31:35.390 --> 31:37.030
The one who can't handle his drink.

31:37.070 --> 31:40.310
You know, every time Father
put me down in front of everyone,

31:40.350 --> 31:44.990
Freddie here would say nothing.
He was scared, see...

31:45.030 --> 31:48.110
You want to be angry with someone?
That man's radio broadcast

31:48.150 --> 31:50.270
practically caused
our father's heart attack.

31:50.310 --> 31:52.320
Poor Freddie, the coward.

31:52.383 --> 31:55.863
- Still doing his parent's dirty work.
- Excuse me.

31:55.903 --> 31:57.863
- Freddie.
- Turn around.

32:06.383 --> 32:08.223
Robbie, would you mind
getting my brother

32:08.263 --> 32:09.863
a strong, black coffee, please?

32:09.903 --> 32:12.463
It wasn't the American, Freddie.
Haven't you grasped that?

32:12.488 --> 32:14.987
- He's just a voice on the radio.
- Enough now, Toby, please!

32:15.027 --> 32:15.925
It was me!

32:15.979 --> 32:19.623
I told them all about Father,
I told them all about his mistress

32:19.663 --> 32:22.183
and I told him all about
her time in Germany.

32:25.663 --> 32:29.623
Doesn't family loyalty
mean anything to you?!

32:29.663 --> 32:31.583
God, you even sound like him!

32:37.623 --> 32:39.263
Bloody hell!

32:39.303 --> 32:41.623
Hey! Hey! Come on, take it easy.

32:41.663 --> 32:44.463
No wonder he left you everything.
You're practically the same!

32:44.503 --> 32:46.303
Don't you think I hated him as well?!

32:49.678 --> 32:51.438
I never wanted this!

32:51.463 --> 32:55.903
And I'm glad,
I'm glad that he's gone.

33:38.911 --> 33:40.631
I remember what it was like
to be young,

33:40.671 --> 33:42.351
to be driven by your emotions.

33:42.391 --> 33:46.511
But last night, you two...
disgraced the family name.

33:46.551 --> 33:50.551
Brawling in front of staff,
intoxicated,

33:50.591 --> 33:52.551
fighting like common children.

33:52.591 --> 33:54.351
Don't smirk.

33:54.391 --> 33:56.231
Don't feed the dog at the table.

33:56.271 --> 33:57.871
You're supposed to be men now,

33:57.911 --> 33:59.831
please live up to
your responsibilities.

34:08.511 --> 34:10.670
I didn't mean to take it out on you.

34:10.710 --> 34:14.391
I'm sorry, I should have stuck up
for you more. All those years.

34:18.031 --> 34:21.630
I've decided to apply to the
War Office, to do my bit.

34:21.670 --> 34:23.911
They probably won't accept me but...

34:23.951 --> 34:26.670
Of course they will, Toby.
They'll be lucky to have you.

34:30.670 --> 34:32.351
What?

34:32.391 --> 34:34.991
No, just the first time
I've received a compliment

34:35.031 --> 34:36.951
from a Lord Hamilton.

34:41.391 --> 34:43.670
You know you don't
have to be like him.

34:43.710 --> 34:47.190
You can do things differently.

34:53.471 --> 34:56.791
I understand you stepped in for us
last night, Mr. O'Hara?

34:56.831 --> 34:58.791
Anything for a free drink.

34:58.831 --> 35:03.311
Charity Lambert, she is planning on
writing her memoirs.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.311
Looking for some assistance.

35:05.351 --> 35:08.551
I suppose she has a right
to tell her story.

35:08.591 --> 35:11.311
It's not exactly Dostoevsky.

35:11.351 --> 35:14.871
It's revenge on the Hamiltons,
she'll say anything, write anything

35:14.911 --> 35:17.031
so long as it destroys
their reputation.

35:17.071 --> 35:19.671
And this place along with it.

35:19.711 --> 35:22.711
I appreciate the warning, Mr. O'Hara.

35:27.511 --> 35:29.631
Will you please inform Lord Hamilton

35:29.671 --> 35:31.991
I need to see him in my office
at one o'clock.

35:32.031 --> 35:34.511
And stress it's of the
utmost importance.

35:34.551 --> 35:37.191
Mr. Feldman, kindly fetch Billy,
will you?

35:37.231 --> 35:40.751
Civilian clothes. I'll be
waiting outside for both of you.

35:40.791 --> 35:42.871
Right.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.631
Did Lady Hamilton send you?

35:46.671 --> 35:49.751
I wished she had. May I?

35:52.871 --> 35:56.831
People know what you said
at the meeting last week.

35:56.871 --> 35:58.991
About the Fuhrer.

35:59.031 --> 36:01.471
About joining with Germany.

36:01.511 --> 36:03.271
People? What people?

36:14.751 --> 36:17.911
Right now, they think I'm here
acting as your friend.

36:17.951 --> 36:20.671
Gathering information,

36:20.711 --> 36:24.711
finding out if you are involved
in something bigger.

36:26.271 --> 36:30.231
I don't... I don't believe you,
they could be anyone.

36:30.271 --> 36:35.111
Well, just remember I tried to
warn you. I did that much at least.

36:37.311 --> 36:39.271
Well, what will they do with me?

36:39.311 --> 36:44.271
You know they're looking to intern
Mosley and many others for treason.

36:44.311 --> 36:45.951
No, I can't go to jail!

36:45.991 --> 36:50.991
What did you expect? You fraternised
with members of the Nazi party.

36:51.031 --> 36:55.031
You tried to sway your country
towards joining the Third Reich.

36:58.631 --> 37:00.511
If you were to disappear...

37:00.551 --> 37:05.871
for a while until this
blows over, until the war ends.

37:05.911 --> 37:09.671
Or until... until the Germans come.

37:09.711 --> 37:11.991
Leave.

37:13.951 --> 37:16.031
It's the only choice you have left.

37:23.791 --> 37:26.151
She probably took
one look at your ugly mug

37:26.191 --> 37:27.791
and decided to scarper.

37:27.831 --> 37:30.871
That's a bit rich coming from you.
Go on, kid. I'll see you later.

37:32.431 --> 37:34.151
Don't do this.

37:34.191 --> 37:36.671
Lord Hamilton treated me
with respect.

37:36.711 --> 37:40.351
When Emma and I had nothing,
he gave us a chance.

37:40.391 --> 37:43.871
Sometimes all a man has
is his honour.

37:43.911 --> 37:47.311
- I disagree.
- No, you don't.

37:53.911 --> 37:56.551
You didn't need to sort things out
with Charity Lambert.

37:56.591 --> 37:59.031
It wouldn't have been your problem
for much longer.

37:59.071 --> 38:01.111
It was still my job.

38:01.151 --> 38:04.111
Your father was a complex man.

38:04.151 --> 38:07.591
But he was good to me and Emma.

38:07.631 --> 38:09.951
And I shall miss him.

38:14.991 --> 38:16.791
Freddie...

38:21.111 --> 38:26.391
last night I removed money
from the safe without authorisation.

38:28.351 --> 38:30.351
I took it to a casino.

38:32.231 --> 38:35.031
- And did you win?
- That's not the point.

38:35.071 --> 38:36.871
Well, you either won or you lost.

38:38.951 --> 38:43.311
I won. On the final spin.
But as I said...

38:43.351 --> 38:46.031
Well, you were concerned
for your future. Emma's future.

38:46.071 --> 38:48.431
I am not offering excuses.

38:53.471 --> 38:56.351
And do you think by being honest
you'll somehow keep your job?

38:58.671 --> 39:01.111
- I just want a clear conscience.
- Good.

39:03.311 --> 39:06.351
Because my mind was made up on this
before I even sat down.

39:08.511 --> 39:12.431
You have served this hotel
and my family for nearly 10 years.

39:12.471 --> 39:16.431
I see no reason to change that.

39:19.471 --> 39:21.951
Freddie...

39:21.991 --> 39:24.871
Freddie, your father would not have
tolerated my behaviour.

39:24.911 --> 39:26.711
I am not my father, Mr. Garland.

39:28.471 --> 39:30.751
Now, I don't know what secrets
you had on him

39:30.791 --> 39:32.751
or indeed what secrets
he had on you,

39:32.791 --> 39:36.991
but rest assured my mother will do
all she can to bring you down.

39:39.271 --> 39:42.551
I would make sure your house is in
order. Do we understand each other?

39:44.998 --> 39:48.798
Yes, we do... Lord Hamilton.

40:07.998 --> 40:10.878
- You knew this was going to happen.
- Honestly, I didn't.

40:10.918 --> 40:14.198
You had a plan,
all the pieces falling into place.

40:14.238 --> 40:16.998
Believe it or not, Freddie Hamilton
came through for us, Em.

40:17.038 --> 40:19.598
Things will be different.

40:19.638 --> 40:23.158
And as such it would be prudent
to appoint an assistant manager.

40:23.198 --> 40:25.358
Mr. Reynolds might be a good choice.

40:25.398 --> 40:27.878
He'd be an excellent choice.

40:27.918 --> 40:31.878
Except he does tend to do things
by the book,

40:31.918 --> 40:36.078
a book which I imagine is old
and dusty and rather out of date.

40:37.414 --> 40:39.453
How would you feel about the job?

40:41.558 --> 40:44.118
- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes.

40:52.838 --> 40:55.918
Now, if you'll excuse me, there's
one more thing I must attend to.

41:03.878 --> 41:08.998
I didn't do it to stand against you.
I did it for the good of the hotel.

41:11.518 --> 41:13.678
Mother, please.

41:13.718 --> 41:16.798
I have to go back to base, I don't
want to leave things like this.

41:21.038 --> 41:22.918
Mother?

41:43.918 --> 41:45.798
Your Ladyship.

41:47.158 --> 41:49.398
Come to gloat, have you, Mr. Garland?

41:49.438 --> 41:52.878
I don't know why I'm surprised
by Freddie's actions.

41:52.918 --> 41:55.678
All my life I've been dictated to
by men.

41:55.718 --> 41:57.518
Why should my son be any different?

41:57.558 --> 41:59.798
Perhaps he sees some value in me.

42:02.038 --> 42:03.758
You never cared
about this place before.

42:03.798 --> 42:05.558
Yes, you'd like to see me sidelined.

42:05.598 --> 42:07.998
Wasting away in the country.

42:08.038 --> 42:11.238
Well, that's not going to happen
so, please...

42:13.678 --> 42:15.478
What are you waiting for?

42:15.518 --> 42:17.118
For me to show you the bloody door?

42:17.158 --> 42:19.398
I know what you're going through.

42:19.438 --> 42:22.878
My wife passed away and I was hurt
and angry

42:22.918 --> 42:25.918
and I was ashamed of how I felt.

42:27.678 --> 42:30.958
But these feelings
are the price we pay.

42:30.998 --> 42:33.558
For loving someone.

42:33.598 --> 42:35.958
For letting them hurt us.

42:37.598 --> 42:40.638
And for the empty space
they leave behind.

42:42.478 --> 42:45.078
But this will pass.

42:45.118 --> 42:48.238
You will survive,
you will be stronger.

42:48.278 --> 42:50.798
I give you my word.

42:55.358 --> 42:57.798
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

43:00.678 --> 43:03.438
And I believe I told you to leave,
Mr. Garland.

43:03.478 --> 43:05.158
Now get out!

43:39.878 --> 43:41.718
Are you going?

43:41.758 --> 43:46.358
Recall to base.
Some evacuation plan.

43:46.398 --> 43:49.278
So, all hands on deck, as it were.

43:51.318 --> 43:52.998
You're working late.

43:53.038 --> 43:54.878
I'm clearing out my things.

43:57.838 --> 44:00.078
Emma, don't.

44:01.918 --> 44:06.638
I know I've been stupid
and made mistakes

44:06.678 --> 44:08.358
and I'm not asking you
to forgive me,

44:08.398 --> 44:12.918
but when I think of this place
it's not my family,

44:12.958 --> 44:15.358
my father...

44:17.638 --> 44:19.598
it's you.

44:21.078 --> 44:24.038
And it really wouldn't be the same
without you, so, please.

44:24.078 --> 44:27.158
Please, just don't leave.

44:30.558 --> 44:34.238
I'm clearing out my things because I've
been promoted to assistant manager.

44:35.878 --> 44:38.238
I'm moving into the office.

44:38.278 --> 44:41.678
Well done you.

44:41.718 --> 44:46.078
Thank you. This place really has
gone to the dogs then, hasn't it?

44:46.118 --> 44:48.558
Freddie Hamilton, get out!

45:02.678 --> 45:04.718
But make sure you come back.
