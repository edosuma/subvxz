00:17.475 --> 00:18.393
<i> Love,</i>

00:18.893 --> 00:21.104
<i>this is why you're not for me.</i>

00:22.647 --> 00:24.816
<i>Once upon a time, I believed in love.</i>

00:25.483 --> 00:28.319
<i>Sure, I'd been hurt before,</i>
<i>but I'd learned from that,</i>

00:28.403 --> 00:30.822
<i>and I wanted to fight for a fresh start.</i>

00:31.281 --> 00:33.241
<i>The real thing this time.</i>

00:34.284 --> 00:35.702
<i>So, boy meets girl,</i>

00:35.785 --> 00:38.121
<i>boy knows this is a something special,</i>
<i>and he thinks,</i>

00:38.204 --> 00:42.083
<i>"Let me do everything I can</i>
<i>to make this right."</i>

00:43.209 --> 00:45.170
<i>So, I did.</i>

00:48.006 --> 00:49.090
<i> I was brave.</i>

00:49.507 --> 00:50.759
<i>I was vulnerable.</i>

00:51.634 --> 00:53.428
<i>I won her the old-fashioned way.</i>

00:55.346 --> 00:57.557
<i>I tried to do everything right</i>

00:58.308 --> 00:59.309
<i>for her.</i>

00:59.809 --> 01:02.479
<i>I knew you have to do anything for love.</i>

01:03.354 --> 01:04.314
<i>So I did.</i>

01:05.440 --> 01:06.941
<i>I did whatever I had to,</i>

01:07.025 --> 01:08.443
<i>whatever it took.</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:10.737
I love you, Joe.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.238
I love you too.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.783
I heard about you and Candace.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.868
You know, I thought we were pretty happy,

01:16.951 --> 01:18.703
but she thought she could
be happier with...

01:19.579 --> 01:20.747
some guy in Rome, so...

01:20.830 --> 01:23.541
It's just how she left so suddenly...

01:24.084 --> 01:26.920
<i> But she did not trust me.</i>

01:27.420 --> 01:30.256
<i>So she started asking questions</i>
<i>about the past.</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:31.174
<i>Candace?</i>

01:31.257 --> 01:33.259
I think they dated.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.053
Oh, they did.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.722
<i>But I can't say I was shocked</i>
<i>when it didn't work out.</i>

01:37.806 --> 01:39.057
Who's Elijah?

01:40.266 --> 01:41.518
Give me my phone, Joe.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.395
-<i> He's not your brother, I know that.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>I don't love you.</i>

01:44.562 --> 01:45.396
I never have.

01:48.024 --> 01:51.402
<i> She started digging for stuff</i>
<i>that should have stayed buried.</i>

01:53.738 --> 01:54.739
<i>I picked wrong.</i>

01:55.198 --> 01:56.241
<i>I made mistakes.</i>

01:58.660 --> 02:00.120
<i>Love had made me blind.</i>

02:00.203 --> 02:01.037
<i> Joe!</i>

02:01.121 --> 02:01.996
<i>And now...</i>

02:02.080 --> 02:02.956
Joe!

02:03.039 --> 02:04.582
<i>...love turned to poison.</i>

02:04.666 --> 02:06.042
<i> Tell me I'm crazy.</i>

02:07.127 --> 02:08.378
Tell me you didn't...

02:09.379 --> 02:10.922
kill Peach.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.385
Tell me you didn't kill Peach.

02:16.469 --> 02:20.223
<i> And when love dies, it really hurts.</i>

02:20.598 --> 02:22.517
<i>-The bottom line is...</i>

02:24.644 --> 02:25.854
<i>she couldn't love me back.</i>

02:30.233 --> 02:31.568
<i>And our love died.</i>

02:32.026 --> 02:33.236
<i>I thought that was the end.</i>

02:34.112 --> 02:35.280
<i>A sad story.</i>

02:37.073 --> 02:40.034
<i>A broken heart I'd have to heal from</i>
<i>to love again.</i>

02:41.327 --> 02:44.414
<i>But no, there was more hurt in store.</i>

02:48.334 --> 02:49.169
Candace.

02:49.252 --> 02:52.172
I think we have some unfinished business
to talk about.

02:53.006 --> 02:53.882
Yeah.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.885
<i> And so I realize this is what I get</i>

02:57.510 --> 02:58.887
<i>for trying so hard.</i>

02:58.970 --> 02:59.971
<i>I can't love again.</i>

03:00.388 --> 03:03.099
<i>I can't risk it. It's too dangerous.</i>

03:03.850 --> 03:06.394
<i>The only fresh start is a start</i>

03:06.853 --> 03:07.854
<i>without love.</i>

03:07.937 --> 03:08.855
Cut!

03:08.938 --> 03:11.900
We're gonna go again from the top.
Quickly.

03:12.775 --> 03:13.610
Nice.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.404
Print that.
We're gonna go again from the top.

03:16.779 --> 03:17.697
<i> This...</i>

03:18.198 --> 03:19.699
<i>is what it's come to.</i>

03:24.454 --> 03:25.955
<i>♪ I'm a troubled man ♪</i>

03:26.039 --> 03:28.208
<i>♪ Changed by the things I do ♪</i>

03:28.333 --> 03:30.335
♪<i> True, but it's funny how </i>♪

03:31.461 --> 03:34.130
<i> Love has taken me to dark places.</i>

03:35.882 --> 03:37.508
<i>But Los Angeles...</i>

03:38.635 --> 03:40.803
<i>has gotta be as dark as it gets.</i>

03:42.013 --> 03:44.474
<i>When you're running from someone</i>
<i>who thinks they know you,</i>

03:44.849 --> 03:47.101
<i>the best place to hide</i>
<i>is a city they think you hate</i>

03:47.393 --> 03:49.062
<i>because, well, I do.</i>

03:49.145 --> 03:50.271
Hi, gorgeous people!

03:50.355 --> 03:52.148
Just wanna say thank you. Wow.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.650
Three million followers?

03:54.317 --> 03:57.320
I'm honestly choked up
thinking about how much I love each...

03:57.403 --> 04:01.032
<i> I'm closing my heart,</i>
<i>like an out-of-business bookstore,</i>

04:01.115 --> 04:03.910
<i>and I'm here for the moment</i>
<i>where everyone is too into themselves</i>

04:03.993 --> 04:05.453
<i>to ever connect with another person.</i>

04:05.536 --> 04:08.039
<i>It's the worst city in the world</i>
<i>and the last place I wanna be,</i>

04:08.122 --> 04:09.290
<i>and that's perfect.</i>

04:09.999 --> 04:10.917
<i>It's temporary.</i>

04:11.209 --> 04:15.129
<i>Regroup, get some cash together,</i>
<i>figure out next moves, go.</i>

04:15.672 --> 04:17.090
<i>Never look back.</i>

04:17.173 --> 04:19.550
<i>It's a chance to get back</i>
<i>to who I really am:</i>

04:20.176 --> 04:21.970
<i>-a quiet guy...</i>

04:22.220 --> 04:24.514
<i>...who just wants to lead a quiet life.</i>

04:32.772 --> 04:35.149
<i> I've done time in uglier cages.</i>

04:36.234 --> 04:37.777
Welcome. I'm Delilah.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.654
Will Bettelheim. Nice to meet you.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.364
Your credit came back sparkling, Will.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.490
Oh, good, good.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.617
But I looked you up.
You're not on the socials.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.244
Like, at all.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.329
Thought you might be some kind of freak.

04:48.579 --> 04:51.082
Just not great
at keeping up with that stuff.

04:51.165 --> 04:54.127
Do you not keep up
with brushing your teeth?

04:54.711 --> 04:56.921
I'm kidding,
I'm kidding. Okay.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.590
I just have this vacancy
on the first floor.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.468
-Do you wanna see it? It's bigger.
-I like the second floor.

05:02.885 --> 05:03.720
It's quieter.

05:04.053 --> 05:04.971
All right.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.432
So rent's due on the third,

05:07.807 --> 05:09.934
No loud music after ten.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.020
Two pet limit.

05:12.103 --> 05:15.732
And don't cook meth in your kitchen.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.858
You got it.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.989
You can keep the furniture if you want
or just let me know

05:23.072 --> 05:24.490
and we can have someone take it out.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.952
The last tenant
kind of left in a hurry, so...

05:28.661 --> 05:30.747
hopefully it'll be better luck for you.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.167
I'm in number one if you need anything.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.585
That sounds great.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.504
All right. See ya.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.804
<i> Home sweet prison.</i>

05:54.812 --> 05:57.148
<i>It's uncomfortable, all of this.</i>

05:58.066 --> 05:59.692
<i>But that's good, I'm detoxing.</i>

06:00.234 --> 06:01.778
<i>Detox should be uncomfortable.</i>

06:02.362 --> 06:04.072
<i>I've left so much behind.</i>

06:05.114 --> 06:08.034
<i>And I know there's a side of me</i>

06:08.117 --> 06:09.619
<i>that I let get out of control,</i>

06:09.702 --> 06:12.789
<i>and now controlling</i> <i>is everything.</i>

06:12.872 --> 06:14.457
<i>But, that said,</i>

06:14.540 --> 06:16.376
<i>cold turkey leads to rebound,</i>

06:16.459 --> 06:17.710
<i>leads to heartbreak,</i>

06:17.794 --> 06:19.212
<i>if not crime scenes,</i>

06:19.295 --> 06:21.964
<i>and posthumous best sellers.</i>

06:23.132 --> 06:24.592
<i>Addiction management is key.</i>

06:25.551 --> 06:26.594
<i>Ten minutes a day.</i>

06:26.677 --> 06:28.721
<i>Do not fixate on any one person.</i>

06:28.805 --> 06:30.765
<i>Do not get involved,</i>
<i>do not even look them up,</i>

06:30.848 --> 06:33.768
<i>because I know I can get swept up.</i>

06:33.851 --> 06:35.853
<i>-But that's not happening.</i>

06:36.771 --> 06:38.731
<i>This is a fresh start.</i>

06:47.615 --> 06:48.866
<i>In my dreams...</i>

06:49.450 --> 06:50.368
<i>Beck's alive.</i>

06:51.411 --> 06:53.538
<i>She forgives me for everything I did.</i>

06:53.621 --> 06:55.998
<i>She apologizes for everything she did.</i>

06:56.332 --> 06:58.042
<i>And she says, "Don't worry,</i>

06:58.126 --> 06:59.168
<i>Candace is gone.</i>

07:00.253 --> 07:01.295
<i>Forever."</i>

07:02.213 --> 07:03.548
<i>But then I wake up...</i>

07:04.257 --> 07:05.341
<i>and remember.</i>

07:06.426 --> 07:09.178
I think we have
some unfinished business to talk about.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.263
Okay.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.932
Okay, let's go somewhere

07:13.349 --> 07:15.560
and we can sit and talk.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.562
As long as it's nice...

07:17.979 --> 07:19.147
and public.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.572
Are you gonna tell me what you want?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.198
I'm craving French fries.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.533
Candace--

07:30.616 --> 07:33.786
-Hi. What can I get for you?
-Fries, please, a side of ranch.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.788
Vanilla milkshake.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.248
You want anything, bunny?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.293
-No.
- Okay.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.627
I'll be right back.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.092
I want you to know I want it to stay gone.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.969
I mean, you sure thought I was dead

07:50.052 --> 07:51.888
or you wouldn't have
just left me there, right?

07:52.013 --> 07:54.432
I was prepared to count my blessings
and never come back.

07:54.515 --> 07:55.850
That's not how any of it happened.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.685
So, anyways, there I am,

07:58.186 --> 07:59.312
in a new town,

07:59.770 --> 08:01.063
a new girl,

08:02.148 --> 08:03.649
and I walk into this store,

08:04.108 --> 08:05.485
and there's this book...

08:06.569 --> 08:08.988
by a woman named Guinevere...

08:10.364 --> 08:11.199
Beck.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.412
You did it again, didn't you?

08:18.247 --> 08:19.999
What do you want, Candace?

08:21.292 --> 08:24.545
To kill you with my bare hands.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.757
I'm kidding.

08:28.716 --> 08:29.800
I could never.

08:31.010 --> 08:35.014
I'm gonna go to the cops,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.643
Nope, sorry, not that either.

08:39.810 --> 08:40.978
Too easy on you.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.782
<i> People.</i>

08:52.865 --> 08:54.367
<i>People are predictable.</i>

08:54.450 --> 08:56.285
<i>I cannot afford to be predictable.</i>

08:56.619 --> 08:58.287
<i>My life depends on that.</i>

08:59.038 --> 09:01.666
<i>But love, love is what kept me open,</i>

09:01.749 --> 09:04.669
<i>alive, different, real.</i>

09:04.961 --> 09:08.214
<i>And I also can't afford to do love,</i>
<i>so you see my dilemma.</i>

09:08.297 --> 09:10.216
<i>Lady, how many photos does it take?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

09:10.299 --> 09:12.552
Are you like, "Lady, come on.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.970
How many photos does it take?"

09:14.720 --> 09:17.390
Crazy thing is,
she never posts any of them.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.101
That's, like, gotta be a diagnosis, right?

09:20.351 --> 09:23.145
<i> Precocious, unsupervised kid</i>
<i>who thinks she's not a kid.</i>

09:23.229 --> 09:25.398
Ms. Strauss secretly has six chihuahuas

09:25.481 --> 09:26.941
so she walks them in shifts.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.568
And you?

09:29.527 --> 09:31.529
You are Will Bettelheim,

09:32.071 --> 09:32.905
LA newbie.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.448
Yeah, that's me.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.866
<i> Who is protecting her?</i>

09:35.950 --> 09:37.994
<i>No, no, she is not my problem.</i>

09:38.077 --> 09:38.911
What's your Insta?

09:39.745 --> 09:41.038
Or do you only have a Finsta?

09:41.330 --> 09:43.040
-I'm a little behind the times.
-Clearly.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.252
Anyway, I'm @Ellie-Eyeballs.

09:48.754 --> 09:49.630
So...

09:50.423 --> 09:51.424
you have a girlfriend yet?

09:51.507 --> 09:52.967
<i> Holy shit.</i>

09:53.050 --> 09:54.719
Ellie, how old are you? Like 14?

09:55.011 --> 09:55.970
Fifteen.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.097
Basically 16, so...

09:58.556 --> 10:00.725
<i></i>
<i>No, she's not my problem.</i>

10:01.100 --> 10:02.101
It was nice to meet you.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.352
Cool.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.062
Manners.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.814
Thank you so much for stopping by.

10:06.897 --> 10:08.941
I appreciate being the first call.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.235
So Delilah, she's not a hooker.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.279
It's what you're thinking, right?

10:14.030 --> 10:15.823
Yeah, no, she's a reporter,

10:15.906 --> 10:16.991
that guy's a publicist,

10:17.074 --> 10:21.120
and he just paid some crazy kill fee to
not run something about someone famous.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.247
-It's sick, she's a genius.
- Ellie?

10:23.581 --> 10:25.124
No harassing the tenants.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.876
I'm not. We're old friends.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.753
Well, you're late for school, smart-ass.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.588
<i> Too young to be Ellie's mom.</i>

10:30.880 --> 10:33.090
Is that my shirt? That's my fucking shirt.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.217
-How many times...?
-<i> Sisters.</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:38.721
Can you please not wear that to school
and destroy it, please?

10:39.013 --> 10:41.015
<i> If Delilah counts</i>
<i>as parental supervision,</i>

10:41.432 --> 10:43.976
<i>-it explains everything.</i>
<i>-</i>It looks hotter on me, though.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.729
Cool story. Any day now.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.732
<i> Note to self: steer clear</i>
<i>of their entire red flag galaxy.</i>

10:49.815 --> 10:50.691
Hey.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.820
You lay a finger on her,

10:54.904 --> 10:57.657
and I will vivisect
your individual scrotums.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.033
She's a kid.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.830
<i> In Los Angeles,</i>

11:05.206 --> 11:07.875
<i>grocery stores aren't just a place</i>
<i>you buy carrots,</i>

11:07.958 --> 11:10.878
<i>they're a pristine, non-GMO Disneyland,</i>

11:10.961 --> 11:13.339
<i>and king among these is Anavrin.</i>

11:13.422 --> 11:14.674
<i>Come for the spring lettuce mix,</i>

11:15.132 --> 11:16.842
<i>stay for the perfect life</i>
<i>that could be yours</i>

11:16.926 --> 11:19.512
<i>if you spend enough</i>
<i>and quit gluten, you fucking asshole.</i>

11:20.262 --> 11:23.307
<i>And yeah, obviously, Anavrin is--</i>
<i>wait for it--</i>

11:23.891 --> 11:25.559
<i>"nirvana" spelled backwards.</i>

11:26.602 --> 11:30.272
So, no experience at all in sorting
or bagging perishables?

11:31.565 --> 11:33.234
Well, I'm a quick study.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.029
It's a coveted job.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.532
Yeah, all the casting directors shop here.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.492
-So--
-Oh, I'm not an actor.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.995
Okay, let me xerox some photo ID

11:45.079 --> 11:47.289
and I'll call you ASAP
and I'll let you know.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.083
Sure thing, ID.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.586
Damn.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.923
-I know-- I know I brought it. I just...
-Are you reading that?

11:56.424 --> 11:57.466
Re-reading.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.177
It feels like it gets
more relevant every day, right?

12:00.261 --> 12:02.346
How... so?

12:03.222 --> 12:06.350
Oh, this guy's struggle trying
to get past his mistakes, you know?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.228
I don't like to get political,
but I will say

12:09.311 --> 12:11.814
our world is done for
if we don't think about that.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.441
How to be better.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.485
-I can't believe you just did that.
-Did...?

12:16.944 --> 12:20.030
Made a Russian novel
sound like something I'd <i>want </i>to read.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.452
Uh, I don't mean to spring this on you...

12:24.994 --> 12:26.871
Ever thought about working in a bookstore?

12:30.207 --> 12:33.252
We've been having a time moving product.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.380
You know, I thought
with this whole hacking democracy thing,

12:36.464 --> 12:39.133
people would be like,
"Yeah, I wanna read some Russian stuff.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.551
What's up with that place?" But...

12:41.635 --> 12:42.928
they're intimidated, you know?

12:43.220 --> 12:45.514
Hm, there's nothing to be intimidated by.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.601
It's human experience. It's universal.

12:49.310 --> 12:53.105
<i> I think I just felt my soul</i>
<i>come back into my body.</i>

12:53.189 --> 12:54.023
I love it.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.357
You sound like such a...

12:55.983 --> 12:56.942
a reader.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.945
Maybe it's 'cause
it's my favorite thing to do.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.405
That...

13:01.489 --> 13:02.323
and...

13:03.032 --> 13:04.992
recommending the perfect book.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.243
Can you start tomorrow?

13:07.953 --> 13:10.372
- Yeah.
-Perfect. Let's get you an apron.

13:10.706 --> 13:11.916
<i> A new apron?</i>

13:12.416 --> 13:13.250
<i>Joy.</i>

13:26.347 --> 13:27.306
<i> Hello...</i>

13:27.723 --> 13:28.599
<i>you.</i>

13:28.682 --> 13:30.851
<i>No, fuck, no, I'm not doing that.</i>

13:30.935 --> 13:33.562
<i>I'm not gonna try to figure out</i>
<i>who you are,</i>

13:33.646 --> 13:35.731
<i>why you look so concerned</i>

13:35.815 --> 13:38.442
<i>about the state of that heirloom tomato.</i>

13:41.904 --> 13:44.114
-Oh, did I get you? Are you okay?
-It's okay.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.950
<i> You have a way with people.</i>

13:47.576 --> 13:48.661
<i>They just like you.</i>

13:49.495 --> 13:52.331
<i>Your shirt is faded, but fresh.</i>

13:53.624 --> 13:55.251
<i>You like to take care of things.</i>

13:55.626 --> 13:58.546
<i>Your shoes are clean, but more.</i>

13:58.629 --> 14:00.965
<i>You walk in a town where nobody walks.</i>

14:04.093 --> 14:06.470
<i>I won't say hello.</i>
<i>I'll accidentally bump into you.</i>

14:06.804 --> 14:09.223
<i>You'll never even know I was here.</i>

14:09.557 --> 14:10.558
Excuse me?

14:12.643 --> 14:14.270
Do you think this peach looks like a butt?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.356
There is no wrong answer.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.692
It looks a little like a butt, yeah.

14:20.109 --> 14:20.985
Right?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.446
Hm. Thank you.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.156
<i> Are you flirting?</i>

14:26.490 --> 14:28.784
<i>I'd like to think you are,</i>
<i>but it's just-- I can't.</i>

14:28.868 --> 14:30.661
I should also inform you that...

14:32.413 --> 14:35.457
all peaches look like butts.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.917
<i> I should walk away.</i>

14:38.252 --> 14:39.211
Oh, yes.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.631
Well, thank you for your honesty.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.342
I might go out on a limb
and suggest that...

14:45.593 --> 14:48.888
bell peppers can be extremely vaginal
depending on how you cut them.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.308
I hadn't noticed that,
but I definitely will now. Thank you.

14:52.641 --> 14:53.726
Yeah, no problem.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.312
Were you following me?

14:56.395 --> 14:57.313
<i> Shit.</i>

14:57.396 --> 14:58.564
Well, I mean...

14:58.647 --> 15:01.525
<i> Truth. That is what will</i>
<i>shut this down, truth.</i>

15:01.609 --> 15:03.068
Not initially, but then yes.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.486
I was, completely.

15:04.778 --> 15:05.905
I am sorry...

15:06.572 --> 15:07.656
if I seem skeevy.

15:08.032 --> 15:08.866
No.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.618
I mean, you might've...

15:11.118 --> 15:13.412
if you looked like a skeeve, which...

15:14.246 --> 15:16.540
I guess is me saying, good choice...

15:17.041 --> 15:19.001
showering today.

15:20.044 --> 15:20.961
Good.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.087
I debated, so...

15:22.546 --> 15:23.505
Hm.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.216
All right.

15:27.009 --> 15:27.843
Oh!

15:28.802 --> 15:29.845
You work here?

15:31.722 --> 15:32.640
The apron.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.725
Oh, yeah.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.062
Will. I just started in the cafe.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.856
Me too, um, I uh-- I manage the kitchen.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.150
I do most of the buying for the store.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.110
I was just shopping for my dinner.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.364
Anyway, sorry. Love.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.032
It's my name, I mean.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.826
-<i> No.</i>
-Cool. It's nice to meet you, Love.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.578
<i>No way.</i>

15:54.662 --> 15:55.579
Yeah.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.874
I'll see you in the break room then, Will.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.591
<i> No, not biting.</i>

16:08.175 --> 16:09.885
<i>I'm not that guy anymore,</i>

16:09.969 --> 16:11.887
<i>and I don't think I ever will be again.</i>

16:11.971 --> 16:12.930
<i>I can't be.</i>

16:13.472 --> 16:16.308
<i>Love, you are not for me.</i>

16:24.191 --> 16:26.402
<i> Mooney's Rare and Used,</i>
<i>this is not.</i>

16:26.485 --> 16:30.280
<i>But hey, who needs Cervantes</i>
<i>when you've got chakra clearing?</i>

16:30.364 --> 16:32.199
<i>Ralph Waldo Emerson? No.</i>

16:32.282 --> 16:35.285
<i>Reading the Akashic records? Full shelf.</i>

16:35.369 --> 16:37.204
<i>This is gonna be harder than I thought.</i>

16:37.287 --> 16:39.498
<i>But this is the only safe place</i>
<i>for me right now.</i>

16:39.581 --> 16:42.209
<i> No offense,</i>
<i>you look like you're ready to puke.</i>

16:43.544 --> 16:45.546
Just tell me what you want.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.423
I'm getting to it.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.966
Here you go.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.265
Now you really look
like you're gonna puke.

16:59.643 --> 17:00.811
Sorry, excuse me.

17:10.612 --> 17:11.864
Mmm.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.287
Shit.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.597
<i> At least when I'm here,</i>
<i>it's less about the people,</i>

17:36.680 --> 17:38.348
<i>more about the books.</i>

17:38.891 --> 17:39.767
Excuse me.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.603
Yeah, how can I help?

17:43.187 --> 17:44.146
How can you help?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.065
Yeah. Um...

17:47.024 --> 17:49.318
Can you tell me
if this Carl Jung book is vegan?

17:50.194 --> 17:52.071
Uh, if the-- if the book is--

17:52.154 --> 17:53.655
New here, huh?

17:54.114 --> 17:57.076
Yeah, your apron is, like, very fresh.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.705
<i> Does everyone in LA walk around</i>
<i>like they own the place?</i>

18:01.789 --> 18:03.624
You got me. I just started this week.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.668
The books are made from trees.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.672
-I'm pretty sure those are vegan.
<i>-</i>I'm just messing with you, old sport.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.257
-Forty.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.258
-Calvin.
-Hey.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.135
Did you tell our new friend Will here

18:15.219 --> 18:17.513
that it was Vegan Author Month
at the cafe?

18:17.596 --> 18:20.182
I will get Will on the right page.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.725
I know you will.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.227
Will...

18:23.936 --> 18:26.188
I think you are gonna do really well here.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.856
I like your whole look.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.858
It's very, um... I've-read-a-book.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.694
-Calvin...

18:38.117 --> 18:38.951
So that's...

18:39.368 --> 18:41.995
Forty's parents own the place, obviously.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.581
Shit. He was being cool just now,

18:44.665 --> 18:46.333
but if he comes back
and it's still wrong...

18:46.416 --> 18:48.418
I got it. Don't worry, Calvin.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.796
Watch the register.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.384
Hi.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.263
Let me guess. Hurricane Forty?

19:00.097 --> 19:01.932
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.142
Don't worry.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.644
He almost never actually fires anyone.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.605
You know how some people are,
like, starring in their own movie?

19:08.689 --> 19:10.315
Well, his...

19:11.024 --> 19:13.610
is about a hilarious misunderstood genius

19:13.694 --> 19:15.195
working with idiots.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.823
Right, one of those.

19:21.076 --> 19:21.994
What? Do--

19:22.744 --> 19:23.745
Do I have something?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.956
No, I was just trying to figure out
what your movie is.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.669
Oh, I think it might be the one where
the woman gets the guy in trouble at work

19:30.752 --> 19:32.254
for slacking off.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.674
I'm sorry, I got to go. Thank you, though.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.401
<i> I cannot let you in.</i>

19:59.323 --> 20:00.616
Are you running away from me?

20:02.993 --> 20:04.494
What? No.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.663
I feel like you are.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.713
-I don't think--
-Don't think.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.438
We have about six minutes,
which I think we can make that work.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.029
You like that?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.491
Now say, "I like that, Love."

20:43.951 --> 20:45.661
I like that... Love.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.501
It's just you...

20:53.252 --> 20:54.253
and me.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.060
What's wrong?

21:10.394 --> 21:11.353
I don't do this.

21:11.895 --> 21:12.854
Not anymore.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.111
<i> I don't fantasize</i>

21:19.194 --> 21:21.196
<i>to some impossible version</i>

21:21.613 --> 21:23.282
<i>of a woman I barely know.</i>

21:24.032 --> 21:25.033
<i>It's not good.</i>

21:25.784 --> 21:26.743
<i>No.</i>

21:30.914 --> 21:33.625
<i> It's hard to have</i>
<i>a fresh start, Love,</i>

21:34.084 --> 21:36.086
<i>when the past is on your mind.</i>

21:44.845 --> 21:45.762
Thank you.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.062
Hang on one second.

21:56.148 --> 21:56.982
Hello?

21:57.065 --> 21:58.734
<i>You don't think I have</i>
<i>your fucking number?</i>

21:59.109 --> 22:01.320
I'm not interested
in seeing you dead, Joe.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.612
<i>Truly.</i>

22:03.447 --> 22:06.616
Or turning you in because, best-case,
you go to prison forever.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.493
-I'm hanging up.
<i>-I wouldn't.</i>

22:09.453 --> 22:12.581
See, you'd go to prison as you.

22:12.998 --> 22:17.002
<i>You'd sit there for the rest of your life</i>
<i>thinking you're a good man.</i>

22:17.627 --> 22:20.130
I'm gonna show you who you really are.

22:20.797 --> 22:21.882
<i>And when you see it...</i>

22:22.466 --> 22:24.343
<i>you'll beg me to turn you in.</i>

22:24.593 --> 22:27.846
It's gonna be really fun
fucking destroying you.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.139
And I deserve that.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.183
Candace, listen to me.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.352
You're insane!

22:33.435 --> 22:34.936
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.397
I'll see you soon.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.816
It doesn't take a genius to hunt someone

22:39.900 --> 22:42.319
if you really, really want to.

22:42.402 --> 22:44.321
You see, that's another thing
I learned from you.

22:44.988 --> 22:45.947
<i>Bye, Joe.</i>

22:56.958 --> 22:58.794
<i> I'm getting paranoid.</i>

22:59.294 --> 23:02.172
<i>There's no way she found me so soon.</i>

23:02.255 --> 23:03.382
<i>There's no way.</i>

23:03.465 --> 23:05.384
<i>I won't let Candace get in my head.</i>

23:05.467 --> 23:07.969
<i>That's what crazy people do,</i>
<i>make you crazy.</i>

23:20.732 --> 23:22.067
Who asked you to film me?

23:22.150 --> 23:23.110
No one.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.572
It's just for fun.

23:27.781 --> 23:28.990
<i> Not a good liar.</i>

23:29.741 --> 23:30.742
I'm not mad.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.037
Just give me the phone.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.758
You asshole.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.886
I was making a movie for school.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.140
Ellie.

23:55.058 --> 23:55.892
<i> Shit.</i>

23:55.976 --> 23:57.394
<i>Just a grown man</i>

23:57.477 --> 23:59.771
<i>who put a hand on a teenaged girl.</i>

23:59.855 --> 24:01.898
<i>All good, as long as I fix it.</i>

24:01.982 --> 24:03.525
<i>Which I...</i>

24:03.608 --> 24:07.237
<i>will do right after I fix another thing</i>
<i>I've gotta fix first.</i>

24:07.320 --> 24:10.198
<i>Fuck, I'm starting to believe</i>
<i>in cosmic punishment, Love.</i>

24:10.907 --> 24:12.534
<i>Not just punishment,</i>

24:12.868 --> 24:13.869
<i>actual death.</i>

24:14.661 --> 24:15.662
<i>If LA is hell,</i>

24:16.413 --> 24:20.000
<i>surely the Hollywood DMV</i>
<i>is the Ninth Circle.</i>

24:22.669 --> 24:24.629
Hi, I need a driver's license.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.007
-ID and proof of residence?
-Yep, it's all there.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.268
Is everything okay?

24:38.351 --> 24:39.436
Slow system.

24:41.021 --> 24:43.940
- That is completely unacceptable.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.525
Ma'am,
come up to the window, please.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.319
Just wait, I'll fix this.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.904
<i> I know that voice.</i>

24:49.362 --> 24:50.864
Sir?

24:51.531 --> 24:52.866
This woman has an appointment.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.994
Just like I just had an appointment.
You just helped me five seconds ago.

24:56.953 --> 24:58.246
<i> What are the chances?</i>

24:58.330 --> 25:01.041
She has to come back with somebody
that can speak whatever she speaks.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.084
Arabic? I mean, it's pretty common.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.170
Excuse me, does anybody speak Arabic?

25:05.462 --> 25:06.546
-Anyone?
-I can.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.923
Thank you, sir, please.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.759
Come here. Nobody's gonna skip you, right?

25:12.344 --> 25:13.637
Thank you, everyone.

25:19.017 --> 25:19.851
See?

25:20.477 --> 25:22.521
Someone who can help.
Wasn't that hard to ask.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.773
Some people, huh?

25:26.233 --> 25:27.901
Okay, this is all in order.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.819
You'll step over there
to take the written test.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.738
Okay, thank you.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.785
Will. Kismet, right?

25:36.868 --> 25:38.370
I mean, what are the chances?

25:38.912 --> 25:39.955
I don't always...

25:40.247 --> 25:41.414
cause a scene.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.041
I promise.

25:43.124 --> 25:44.960
That was pretty impressive.

25:45.835 --> 25:48.213
Good, because I actually
frequently do cause a scene.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.840
Well, I have to take this test.

25:52.259 --> 25:54.302
Well, you got this. Here.

25:58.348 --> 25:59.307
For luck.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.353
Next in line, please step forward.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.483
<i> Are you really who you seem to be?</i>

26:08.567 --> 26:11.444
<i>Could anyone be that light and fearless?</i>

26:11.528 --> 26:13.697
<i>You know, I didn't</i>
<i>because I promised myself I wouldn't,</i>

26:13.780 --> 26:16.783
<i>but now it would be weird not to, right?</i>

26:20.829 --> 26:22.289
<i>You're kidding me.</i>

26:22.581 --> 26:25.083
<i>Are you the only woman in Los Angeles</i>

26:25.166 --> 26:27.002
<i>not showing off for strangers?</i>

26:27.502 --> 26:30.630
<i>Speaks well of you,</i>
<i>but does make it trickier.</i>

26:34.342 --> 26:37.012
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i>I know exactly what I need to do.</i>

27:02.287 --> 27:03.121
Ellie.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.624
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27:07.834 --> 27:08.793
It's a new phone.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.712
Since it's my fault you--

27:13.006 --> 27:13.882
It's a little upgrade.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.468
You'll be making movies
on the thing, right?

27:16.551 --> 27:18.511
<i> Cost a chunk of my rent,</i>

27:18.595 --> 27:20.639
<i>and the more money I need,</i>
<i>the longer I stay,</i>

27:20.722 --> 27:22.849
<i>but one problem at a time.</i>

27:23.850 --> 27:25.977
<i>I guess that's Ellie for "thank you."</i>

27:29.147 --> 27:30.482
I didn't mean to scare you.

27:30.565 --> 27:31.566
You didn't.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.234
Of course not.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.403
I'm sorry, anyway.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.865
I was trying to do
this whole <i>vérité</i> thing.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.452
You know, like, you see <i>Tangerine?</i>

27:45.664 --> 27:46.831
I thought you were, like...

27:47.248 --> 27:48.083
hip.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.085
Honestly, I'm more of a book guy.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.630
Why are you robbing your eyeballs
of all things that are good?

27:54.923 --> 27:55.882
Tell you what...

27:56.591 --> 27:58.968
I'm making you a list.

27:59.594 --> 28:03.390
Like, how do you even function
in a world without art?

28:03.890 --> 28:06.059
Don't say you get it in books.
Books take too long.

28:06.142 --> 28:08.436
I'll make you a deal.
You make me that list...

28:09.062 --> 28:10.188
I'll make you a list.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.565
Nothing long. I have a life.

28:12.649 --> 28:13.525
Okay.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.945
Oh, my God, this bitch's feed is so fake.

28:19.489 --> 28:20.740
How do you know?

28:20.824 --> 28:22.075
How-- how do you know...

28:22.742 --> 28:23.785
that it's, uh...

28:24.577 --> 28:25.537
it's-- it's fake?

28:26.579 --> 28:28.873
Uh, I'm an American and I'm 15.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.500
Why do you ask?

28:31.459 --> 28:33.670
I thought you were too good
for the internets.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.090
Actually, I'm thinking of joining.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.135
I'm just a private person.

28:40.427 --> 28:41.469
Well, so am I.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.557
It's why my page is about my work,
not my dumb face.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.059
See?

28:51.521 --> 28:53.064
-Can I...?
-Yeah.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.028
This is great.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.030
Yeah, I know.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.701
God, you really need a sensei,
don't you?

29:06.077 --> 29:07.203
Are you offering to help?

29:08.163 --> 29:09.456
What's in it for me?

29:11.791 --> 29:12.751
I'll owe you one.

29:13.835 --> 29:14.794
That'll work.

29:16.171 --> 29:20.508
Okay, first thing to know
about being authentic and actually cool...

29:21.468 --> 29:24.179
feeds that aren't lame
help people understand you.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.931
But don't overshare, like, your breakfast.

29:27.515 --> 29:29.392
Unless, I don't know,
is breakfast your brand?

29:29.476 --> 29:30.852
I don't know that I have a brand.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.479
It's not that deep.

29:33.062 --> 29:35.231
<i> Your brand could be, like...</i>

29:35.690 --> 29:37.984
<i>you have good taste in whatever</i>

29:38.067 --> 29:39.694
<i>your thing is.</i>

29:40.528 --> 29:42.864
<i>So go places, look,</i>

29:43.156 --> 29:44.949
<i>-if it's interesting, take a pic.</i>

29:45.033 --> 29:47.368
<i>Don't filter, don't hashtag.</i>

29:47.827 --> 29:49.162
<i>Hashtags are thirsty.</i>

29:49.829 --> 29:53.082
That's literally the handbook
to being dope in a sea of basic losers.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.585
Which... most people are.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.421
Just lean into your thing, Will.

29:58.505 --> 30:01.132
But in a not-try-hard

30:01.216 --> 30:03.092
<i>yet-you're-low-key-fascinating</i>
<i>kind of way.</i>

30:03.551 --> 30:05.553
<i>That's how you get her</i>
<i>to fall in love with you.</i>

30:05.637 --> 30:07.847
- What?
-That's why you doing it, right?

30:07.931 --> 30:09.390
-You like someone.
-No.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.267
That's the only reason
anyone posts anything.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.602
I don't like anyone.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.103
Okay.

30:14.187 --> 30:17.565
Uh, the other reason to post is revenge.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.195
You have a nemesis?

30:23.071 --> 30:24.572
I don't have a nemesis.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.116
Don't take this the wrong way, Will.

30:28.034 --> 30:31.162
Please be not this boring
on your Instagram, okay?

30:31.371 --> 30:33.122
I will try my best.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.582
My secretary will bill you.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.585
Thank you.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.764
<i> It's come to this:</i>

30:50.014 --> 30:53.142
<i>get online to blend in,</i>
<i>just long enough to get out</i>

30:53.226 --> 30:55.019
<i>before Candace finds me.</i>

30:55.478 --> 30:59.274
<i>Create a feed of my alleged life</i>
<i>while life happens around me,</i>

30:59.357 --> 31:00.358
<i>but how would I know?</i>

31:00.441 --> 31:01.901
<i>Not that there's much to see.</i>

31:07.740 --> 31:09.200
<i> Friend requested.</i>

31:12.871 --> 31:13.705
<i>Okay.</i>

31:14.163 --> 31:16.249
<i>This sun is nice.</i>

31:16.624 --> 31:18.877
<i>Any place is probably beautiful</i>

31:18.960 --> 31:21.004
<i>when you stop running for one second.</i>

31:21.462 --> 31:23.506
<i>I just want to stop running, Love.</i>

31:24.424 --> 31:25.592
<i>I want a home.</i>

31:34.142 --> 31:34.976
Mom?

31:37.020 --> 31:37.979
Mommy?

31:38.563 --> 31:39.606
-Mommy?
- Joe!

31:39.898 --> 31:40.940
Baby.

31:41.858 --> 31:42.817
Right here.

31:43.651 --> 31:45.111
I was afraid you left.

31:46.779 --> 31:48.406
I went to get sunscreen.

31:48.907 --> 31:49.824
Come here.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.585
It's nice here, right?

32:01.085 --> 32:03.212
We should come here every summer.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.757
It could be our home away from home.

32:07.508 --> 32:08.343
You are home.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.386
Sure, we're home.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.931
No, I mean, my home is you.

32:19.145 --> 32:20.271
Me too, Joey.

32:20.897 --> 32:21.940
Me too, you.

32:24.734 --> 32:25.777
Hey.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.488
Go get some ice cream.

32:29.697 --> 32:32.241
Then meet me back at our favorite spot.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.744
You know, the one from yesterday.
Remember?

32:35.286 --> 32:38.206
And build me a sandcastle.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.207
Okay?

32:41.876 --> 32:45.213
Mommy will be back in just a few shakes.

32:45.964 --> 32:46.881
Okay?

33:09.612 --> 33:12.115
<i> I'm an idiot.</i>

33:13.157 --> 33:15.994
<i>Did I sunburn </i>through <i>this t-shirt?</i>

33:16.077 --> 33:18.037
<i>How is that a thing?</i>

33:21.624 --> 33:24.669
<i>Worth it, all worth it, Love.</i>

33:32.218 --> 33:33.219
<i> Married.</i>

33:34.554 --> 33:35.722
<i>Married?</i>

33:49.360 --> 33:50.611
Hey, Brooklyn!

33:52.238 --> 33:53.448
I know you're in there.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.325
<i> Oh, the happily-wed missus.</i>

33:58.411 --> 33:59.370
I'm sick.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.665
You're a rookie with a sunburn
is what you are.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.167
Calvin told me at the store.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.168
Let me in.

34:08.504 --> 34:09.338
I can help.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.928
-Do you have a medical license?

34:16.095 --> 34:17.013
I'm serious, though.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.973
You didn't need to come
all the way over here.

34:19.182 --> 34:20.349
It's no problem.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.268
I live right in the neighborhood.

34:24.645 --> 34:25.855
All right.

34:27.690 --> 34:28.775
Is that salad dressing?

34:29.275 --> 34:30.485
No, it's apple cider vinegar.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.321
May I?

34:36.157 --> 34:37.492
-You want me to...?
-Yes.

34:39.535 --> 34:43.247
Trust me, in five minutes
you're going to love me for this.

34:44.749 --> 34:45.666
Smells great.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.085
Shut up.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.634
Are you okay? This must hurt.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.471
It doesn't.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.557
<i>You felt that too.</i>

35:01.974 --> 35:04.310
<i>But you're married, so you're safe.</i>

35:04.393 --> 35:06.896
<i>It's actually perfect.</i>

35:06.979 --> 35:08.189
<i>Keep it light,</i>

35:08.272 --> 35:09.148
<i>breezy.</i>

35:10.983 --> 35:12.693
There. We'll give that a minute.

35:17.406 --> 35:18.991
Okay, now I need to ask you a question

35:19.075 --> 35:21.202
that's deadly serious and deeply personal.

35:21.869 --> 35:22.703
Okay.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.039
Is that 99-cent ramen?

35:27.917 --> 35:28.793
-Yeah.
-No.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.253
-Yeah.
-No, Will, no.

35:30.336 --> 35:31.838
You're an Angeleno now.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.673
I'm not, actually.

35:33.756 --> 35:36.008
You know, you ex-New Yorkers
are the worst.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.220
I mean, haven't-- haven't you ever...
fallen in love

35:39.303 --> 35:40.596
reading Joan Didion

35:40.680 --> 35:42.181
or Raymond Chandler,

35:42.265 --> 35:43.516
or Francesca Lia Block?

35:43.599 --> 35:44.559
You know, these...

35:47.228 --> 35:49.856
-You've never read Joan fucking Didion.
- A little.

35:49.939 --> 35:52.108
-She's next.
-No, you, you're missing out, okay?

35:52.191 --> 35:53.609
This city, is...

35:53.693 --> 35:55.236
it's... it's...

35:55.319 --> 35:56.863
a million cities, it's...

35:57.155 --> 35:58.114
I mean...

36:02.160 --> 36:04.453
We're going. We're going!

36:04.537 --> 36:05.496
Where, exactly?

36:06.664 --> 36:08.749
As many places as we need to
to convert you.

36:08.958 --> 36:09.792
Come on.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.545
Let's go!

36:12.628 --> 36:14.255
-Okay.
-Come on, snob!

36:14.338 --> 36:15.715
All right, hang on a minute.

36:15.798 --> 36:16.966
Need to get my jacket.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.387
Okay.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.472
Just gotta lock up.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.061
<i> It's my favorite place in the city.</i>

36:29.812 --> 36:31.063
<i>I have this theory.</i>

36:31.147 --> 36:34.192
<i>It's not my theory, it's the late,</i>
<i>great food writer Jonathan Gold's,</i>

36:34.275 --> 36:37.403
<i>whose life mission was to know</i>
<i>Los Angeles the best way:</i>

36:37.945 --> 36:38.779
<i>through food.</i>

36:39.238 --> 36:40.656
<i>And, uh, he said,</i>

36:40.740 --> 36:43.451
<i>"There exists for each of us</i>
<i>a perfect taco."</i>

36:43.534 --> 36:44.368
<i>Point is...</i>

36:44.577 --> 36:45.536
Is it good?

36:45.620 --> 36:48.831
<i> ...we are gonna find you</i>
<i>your perfect bite.</i>

36:48.915 --> 36:50.291
-It's amazing.
-But is it perfect?

36:50.374 --> 36:51.209
It's a taco.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.795
We have more work to do. Come, let's go.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.298
Wait, hang on, this?

36:57.381 --> 36:59.800
-You're telling me--
-No, no, no. Come on, come on, please.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.511
You are going to love it.
It's going to be so worth it.

37:05.556 --> 37:06.432
Okay.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.476
Thank you.

37:10.811 --> 37:11.938
So you really didn't like it?

37:12.021 --> 37:13.981
No! No, no, no.
I would bathe in that sauce.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.149
Stop lying to me.

37:16.150 --> 37:17.360
I'll figure you out.

37:17.443 --> 37:18.736
This is science.

37:19.445 --> 37:21.155
<i>♪ Victories ♪</i>

37:21.656 --> 37:23.532

37:26.327 --> 37:31.040

37:32.416 --> 37:34.627

37:37.088 --> 37:38.422
Oh, so close.

37:39.548 --> 37:40.508
Inches away.

37:42.885 --> 37:43.719
Okay.

37:44.637 --> 37:45.888
Research complete.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.099
Final destination.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.227
Let's hit it!

38:16.252 --> 38:19.046
<i> Let me tell you a little bit</i>
<i>about yourself, Will Bettelheim.</i>

38:20.589 --> 38:21.799
<i>You are not a snob.</i>

38:24.093 --> 38:25.469
<i>You're just old-fashioned.</i>

38:27.430 --> 38:28.931
<i>You like things that are real,</i>

38:29.390 --> 38:31.142
<i>made right by people who care.</i>

38:31.225 --> 38:33.185
<i>You like strong flavors.</i>

38:33.269 --> 38:35.021
<i>Gimmicks don't seduce you.</i>

38:35.104 --> 38:37.273
<i>What seduces you is the real thing.</i>

38:40.151 --> 38:40.985
<i>Therefore...</i>

38:44.155 --> 38:45.114
Roast chicken.

38:45.573 --> 38:46.407
In cooking school,

38:46.490 --> 38:49.160
they used to tell us that you could
tell everything about a cook

38:49.243 --> 38:50.661
based on their roast chicken,

38:50.745 --> 38:52.246
so I became a bit obsessive.

38:52.538 --> 38:54.498
And you are gonna benefit from that.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.334
You went to cooking school?

38:56.625 --> 38:57.543
Yeah.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.086
That's a long story.

39:04.759 --> 39:05.718
<i>Voilà.</i>

39:06.969 --> 39:08.346
Okay.

39:09.555 --> 39:11.891
Make sure you have some skin and carrot...

39:12.683 --> 39:13.976
and some crispy potato...

39:14.060 --> 39:16.854
and then I'll rub it around
in the reduction a little bit.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.443
-May I eat it?
-Yes, you may eat it.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.034
<i> I get it now.</i>

39:30.951 --> 39:31.786
Well?

39:32.703 --> 39:36.123
<i> It's everything I like,</i>
<i>made exquisitely, but what's perfect...</i>

39:36.791 --> 39:38.501
<i>is you made it for me.</i>

39:38.584 --> 39:40.086
Is that you're speechless?

39:41.837 --> 39:42.922
Perfect bite?

39:46.384 --> 39:47.343
Perfect.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.637
It's perfect.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.638
Yes!

39:51.347 --> 39:52.223
I knew it.

39:52.765 --> 39:53.933
You were tough...

39:54.600 --> 39:55.476
but...

39:55.935 --> 39:57.186
I am a champion.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.360
Shit.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.487
-I'm sorry. Did I say--
-No.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.948
I have to tell you something, and...

40:09.323 --> 40:10.908
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

40:11.617 --> 40:14.328
The community garden that we walked by?

40:15.538 --> 40:16.914
I got married there...

40:17.957 --> 40:18.916
three years ago.

40:20.459 --> 40:21.419
Um...

40:21.669 --> 40:24.547
We met in school and we were young, but...

40:24.839 --> 40:25.673
I just knew--

40:25.756 --> 40:28.008
-I'm sorry if I sent the wrong signal--
-No, he's dead.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.972
Yeah, conversation killer.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.351
He got sick.

40:37.810 --> 40:38.978
And they, um...

40:40.062 --> 40:41.564
they tried to figure it out.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.859
But... they did not.

40:47.987 --> 40:50.531
-Love, I'm so sorry.
-No.

40:51.323 --> 40:52.408
No, it's...

40:58.789 --> 40:59.832
It is what it is.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.501
It was almost two years ago now.

41:02.585 --> 41:03.669
And, like, look...

41:04.420 --> 41:05.588
my life's great.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.340
And also, nobody really understands.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.759
I mean, who our age gets married,
let alone widowed?

41:11.635 --> 41:12.636
It's, like...

41:13.804 --> 41:14.805
Victorian.

41:16.932 --> 41:18.934
So, you know, people are nice, but...

41:20.519 --> 41:22.646
they can't really fathom
what I'm going through.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.650
Yeah, it's lonely.

41:27.735 --> 41:28.944
I can imagine.

41:30.738 --> 41:31.655
Yeah, I know.

41:32.740 --> 41:35.701
Ever since it happened, I've been able
to see this thing in people...

41:37.161 --> 41:38.370
who've been through it.

41:40.247 --> 41:42.208
I see that every time I look in your eyes.

41:45.085 --> 41:45.920
Yeah.

41:46.879 --> 41:47.922
You've felt it.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.301
Real love.

41:54.887 --> 41:55.888
Real loss.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.391
Yeah.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.193
Yeah, well...

42:09.777 --> 42:10.986
Did you fall in love?

42:12.029 --> 42:12.988
LA?

42:13.697 --> 42:14.907
Is it so terrible?

42:17.743 --> 42:18.869
It's not terrible.

42:20.829 --> 42:21.705
Good.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.546
I, uh, I got you a, um...

42:30.297 --> 42:31.590
a parting gift.

42:37.012 --> 42:39.223
Yeah, I thought about getting you
something happy, but...

42:39.723 --> 42:40.849
<i> Of course.</i>

42:41.141 --> 42:43.227
<i>-Joan Didion.</i>
- Let's face it,

42:43.310 --> 42:45.396
what you're more interested in
is something...

42:45.938 --> 42:48.148
smart and complex.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.776
A little... dark.

42:51.735 --> 42:52.611
Right?

42:53.779 --> 42:55.239
That's what makes you feel at home.

42:55.531 --> 42:56.740
How do you know that?

42:58.576 --> 42:59.577
Well, 'cause...

43:00.160 --> 43:01.078
me too.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.500
<i> I wanted to think you don't know me.</i>

43:07.376 --> 43:11.005
<i>You can't, but I'm not too proud</i>
<i>to say when I'm wrong.</i>

43:11.380 --> 43:14.008
<i>And maybe I was wrong about you,</i>

43:14.341 --> 43:17.678
<i>and maybe, even a bit, all of LA.</i>

43:17.761 --> 43:22.141
<i>And all I can say is,</i>
<i>I hope I'm also wrong about me.</i>

43:22.224 --> 43:24.435
<i>Maybe I don't need to shut down forever.</i>

43:24.518 --> 43:27.187
<i>Maybe I don't need to run away so fast.</i>

43:27.813 --> 43:29.315
<i>And if that could be...</i>

43:29.690 --> 43:30.733
<i>with you...</i>

43:31.317 --> 43:32.234
Blow.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.235
Ellie.

43:33.319 --> 43:35.487
God, it's from <i>The Big Lebowski.</i>

43:35.821 --> 43:36.780
It's going on your list.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.532
It's two a.m. Does your sister--

43:38.616 --> 43:40.075
Oh, shut up, Dad.

43:40.868 --> 43:41.952
She's right inside.

43:42.369 --> 43:43.704
I just have insomnia.

43:44.663 --> 43:46.790
From the 14 Frappuccinos.

43:46.874 --> 43:48.667
Okay, sorry. I just wanna make sure--

43:48.751 --> 43:50.961
Okay, Mr. Rogers, good night.

43:51.045 --> 43:51.920
Good night.

43:53.297 --> 43:54.256
Oh, Will,

43:54.340 --> 43:56.342
someone came by looking for you.

43:57.092 --> 43:58.010
Old friend?

44:00.012 --> 44:02.306
Jesse. No, Jasper.

44:02.389 --> 44:05.184
He said that you had something
that you wanted to give back

44:05.267 --> 44:06.644
and that he'll be by.

44:07.186 --> 44:08.729
-<i> Fuck.</i>
-Thanks.

44:08.979 --> 44:11.273
Honestly, he seemed a little creepy.

44:12.941 --> 44:16.236
What can I say, friend?
I have creepy taste in friends.

44:16.779 --> 44:18.030
Ew!

45:39.820 --> 45:41.029
Who is Jasper?

45:43.073 --> 45:44.783
Why is he looking for you...

45:45.367 --> 45:46.326
Will?

45:47.536 --> 45:49.580
How are we gonna take care
of this problem?

45:51.290 --> 45:53.542
<i> So here's the thing, Love.</i>

45:53.625 --> 45:54.626
Cut!

45:55.002 --> 45:56.754
<i> It wasn't easy for me to get here,</i>

45:56.837 --> 45:58.964
<i>to buy myself a little time,</i>

45:59.047 --> 46:01.800
<i>this slim chance at a new life.</i>

46:03.552 --> 46:04.511
<i>And then...</i>

46:05.471 --> 46:06.722
<i>I saw you.</i>

46:08.557 --> 46:12.144
<i>And, you know, I really do believe</i>
<i>that things happen for a reason,</i>

46:12.227 --> 46:14.563
<i>that all the hard stuff and the craziness,</i>

46:14.646 --> 46:16.148
<i>and frankly, my own mistakes...</i>

46:16.815 --> 46:19.151
<i>they maybe all led me here...</i>

46:20.027 --> 46:21.236
<i>for a reason.</i>

46:21.987 --> 46:23.071
<i>At least I hope...</i>

46:23.739 --> 46:24.573
<i>that's true.</i>

46:24.656 --> 46:27.868
<i>Because I'm working as hard as I can</i>
<i>to make a fresh start here.</i>

46:27.951 --> 46:30.996
-What the hell were you thinking, Calvin?
-Ray said to stock more fiction.

46:31.079 --> 46:33.290
Yeah, he meant fiction
that people actually wanna read.

46:33.373 --> 46:34.958
- Okay, I just figured that--
-What?

46:35.417 --> 46:37.795
There's a human alive
who wants to read <i>Crime and Punishment?</i>

46:38.420 --> 46:41.298
Look, dude, find a way to move these

46:41.381 --> 46:43.759
or, uh... <i>something's </i>moving.

46:44.635 --> 46:45.886
<i> It's delicate,</i>

46:46.470 --> 46:48.305
<i>the whole... thing.</i>

46:48.388 --> 46:50.724
<i> I have this vacancy</i>
<i>on the first floor.</i>

46:50.808 --> 46:52.059
<i> I like the second floor.</i>

46:52.893 --> 46:54.728
<i> 'Cause it's not just a new home.</i>

46:56.188 --> 46:57.981
<i>It's a new me.</i>

47:08.116 --> 47:09.660
<i> I live right in the neighborhood.</i>

47:09.743 --> 47:10.619
<i>Kismet, right?</i>

47:10.702 --> 47:12.287
<i>I mean, what are the chances?</i>

47:12.371 --> 47:14.248
<i></i>
<i>And when something like that happens,</i>

47:14.331 --> 47:15.290
<i>when it's right,</i>

47:15.374 --> 47:19.753
<i>you start to feel everything aligning,</i>
<i>like fate saying yes.</i>

47:20.128 --> 47:22.005
<i>But again, delicate.</i>

47:22.631 --> 47:24.842
<i>Anyway, this is a bad time,</i>
<i>the worst time,</i>

47:24.925 --> 47:26.468
<i>for a complication.</i>

47:28.053 --> 47:30.514
<i>Maybe I should run right now, Love.</i>

47:31.932 --> 47:34.226
<i>But now I don't want to.</i>

47:34.852 --> 47:38.105
<i>I need to figure out a way</i>
<i>to see this through,</i>

47:38.564 --> 47:39.606
<i>whatever it is...</i>

47:41.400 --> 47:42.317
<i>with you.</i>

48:02.337 --> 48:04.047
<i>You win, Love.</i>

48:04.882 --> 48:05.924
<i>I'll stay.</i>
