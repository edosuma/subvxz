LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, friends, when we last

00:03.264 --> 00:06.615
left our Jane, her world
was turned upside down.

00:06.658 --> 00:08.791
See, she was about to move in
with her baby daddy Rafael,

00:08.834 --> 00:11.707
plus...I was actually planning
on proposing.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.883
But then he started
to pull away,

00:13.926 --> 00:16.451
leaving our Jane confused
and devastated.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.496
Also devastated, Petra.

00:18.540 --> 00:21.891
See, she lied to her girlfriend J.R. to protect herself,

00:21.934 --> 00:24.067
but then J.R. found out
the truth.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.417
I know you murdered your sister.

00:26.461 --> 00:29.290
And Petra tried to explain,
but J.R. left her.

00:29.333 --> 00:32.728
That is, until she realized
Petra was in real trouble.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.817
And luckily,
J.R. got back in time

00:34.860 --> 00:37.037
No!

00:37.080 --> 00:38.516
And that's not even
the craziest part.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.909
The craziest part was...

00:39.952 --> 00:41.476
well, let's just dive in.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.829
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was seven years old,

00:46.872 --> 00:49.614
she celebrated her very first
Day of the Dead.

00:49.658 --> 00:52.574
Wait! Are those
actual dead people?

01:18.208 --> 01:20.558
JANE :
I can't believe he's gone.

01:26.608 --> 01:29.611
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so,
friends, after Michael died,

01:29.654 --> 01:31.830
Jane did her best
to keep him alive.

01:31.874 --> 01:35.617
: I just miss him
so much. I miss his laugh.

01:35.660 --> 01:39.099
And the way he used to crack up
at his own impressions.

01:44.669 --> 01:47.542
And man, did he love
that freakin' cat.

01:49.631 --> 01:53.678
And so, Mateo, that's what
this day is all about.

01:53.722 --> 01:57.465
We tell stories
to keep Michael alive.

01:57.508 --> 02:00.032
But friends,
she didn't expect him

02:00.076 --> 02:02.731
to actually come back
from the freakin' dead.

02:22.054 --> 02:24.535
MICHAEL :
Bo. Bo.

02:24.579 --> 02:27.582
Bo, Bo, hey. Come here.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.019
Come here, buddy.
Bo. Bo.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.586
Come here. Come here, buddy.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.111
Michael?

02:35.155 --> 02:40.551
Actually,
I go by Jason now, ma'am.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.118
Ma'am?

02:42.162 --> 02:45.556
Uh, Jane. Right?

02:49.038 --> 02:50.996
He has amnesia.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.650
What?

02:52.694 --> 02:54.913
Amnesia.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.742
What?

02:57.786 --> 03:02.051
Like, no memory.

03:02.094 --> 03:05.228
You don't remember me?

03:05.272 --> 03:08.840
No, ma'am.

03:08.884 --> 03:11.191
Jane.

03:23.464 --> 03:26.510
RAFAEL:
Jane, breathe...

03:26.554 --> 03:29.165
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay. To do this formally...

03:34.126 --> 03:35.737
JANE: I don't
understand.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.129
You were dead.

03:37.173 --> 03:40.045
He was dead. We buried him.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.657
Rose orchestrated everything.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.963
Michael is alive.

03:45.007 --> 03:45.964
What?

03:46.008 --> 03:48.489
I faked his death.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.491
Tetrodotoxin to slow
his heart rate,

03:50.534 --> 03:53.276
and then my EMT drivers
took him away.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.191
You wouldn't believe
how easy it was

03:55.235 --> 03:56.932
to incentivize
a morgue pathologist

03:56.975 --> 03:59.935
with a gambling problem
to sign a death certificate.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.676
So, yes.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.287
He lives.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.942
He lives.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.857
Unfortunately,
he does

04:08.900 --> 04:10.859
have amnesia, though.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.253
Goes by Jason now.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.864
After Jason Bourne.

04:15.907 --> 04:18.345
I always did love
a good play on words.

04:18.388 --> 04:19.998
H-How did you...?Electroshock therapy

04:20.042 --> 04:23.219
focused on the hippocampus
and temporal lobe.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.830
Until it worked.Where...

04:25.874 --> 04:28.703
is he?
Mm.

04:28.746 --> 04:33.664
I'll tell you where Michael is
when you tell me where Luisa is.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.058
I got a DNA test.

04:36.101 --> 04:39.235
It's him, Jane.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.848
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Inhala, exhala, Jane.

04:45.415 --> 04:46.851
RAFAEL:
Go on.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.984
Why don't you
tell her your story?

04:49.027 --> 04:51.203
Actually, can you?

04:51.247 --> 04:54.032
Sorry, I'm just not
much of a talker, you know?

04:54.076 --> 04:55.904
You should really tell her.

04:55.947 --> 04:58.863
MICHAEL:
Well, four years ago,

04:58.907 --> 05:03.868
I woke up in a field in Montana
with no memories.

05:03.912 --> 05:09.004
Um, some lady was there, um,
said I should start over,

05:09.047 --> 05:11.615
so that's what I did.

05:11.659 --> 05:14.618
Didn't you try to find
out who you were?

05:14.662 --> 05:18.579
The lady said that I was in
a whole lot of trouble, so...

05:18.622 --> 05:23.540
I didn't know if I was
a good guy or a bad guy.

05:23.584 --> 05:27.979
You were a really good guy.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.982
Anyway, I should

05:31.026 --> 05:34.029
take Bo out to do his thing.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.038
JANE :
Hello?We couldn't wait.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.735
Are you engaged?

05:44.779 --> 05:46.955
Oh. No.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.391
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But she might be married.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.480
Hon, i-is everything okay?

05:52.874 --> 05:54.832
Um, can-can you...?Yeah, yeah.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.182
Mm-hmm.Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, hello?

05:57.226 --> 06:00.055
Yeah. And so, friends,
the story spread quickly...

06:00.098 --> 06:03.275
Michael's alive?

06:03.319 --> 06:05.321
...as stories do.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.674
Until it didn't.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.763
To be fair,
Petra was also dealing

06:12.807 --> 06:14.069
with an unexpected return.

06:14.112 --> 06:16.680
This whole time, it was you?
Get the gun.

06:16.724 --> 06:20.510
Who is it? Who did I just shoot?

06:20.554 --> 06:21.903
My ex-husband.

06:21.946 --> 06:24.471
Milos. To remind you...

06:31.347 --> 06:33.131
I can't believe this.

06:33.175 --> 06:37.092
I was just trying to get you in
jail, since you get me in jail.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.572
Not a great one, apparently.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.400
You were going to kill me.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.923
Oh, stop.

06:41.966 --> 06:44.099
I wasn't going
to kill you.You saved my life.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.883
Just scare you.
Maybe...

06:45.927 --> 06:48.843
shoot off a leg or something.

06:48.886 --> 06:51.672
Wait. Why are you
looking like that?

06:51.715 --> 06:52.934
Are you two really dating?

06:52.977 --> 06:54.762
What?I read all

06:54.805 --> 06:56.546
of Petra's e-mails and texts.

06:56.590 --> 07:00.463
Oops, forgot one last reminder.

07:00.507 --> 07:03.292
I thought that was just cover
since you were working together.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.035
Now I know why
you didn't love me.

07:07.078 --> 07:09.254
You are lesbian.

07:09.298 --> 07:12.214
To remind you, he sold grenades out of the hotel.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.781
But sure,

07:13.824 --> 07:15.435
we'll go
with the lesbian thing.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.654
I'm calling the police.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.482
Wait.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.179
Are you sure you want
to call police

07:21.223 --> 07:25.445
on man that owns two-thirds
of Marbella Hotel?

07:25.488 --> 07:27.229
What?

07:27.272 --> 07:29.840
Crazy doctor Luisa put
all her shares in trust

07:29.884 --> 07:33.888
and gives to cute
little baby ferrets.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.585
Only,

07:35.629 --> 07:37.457
I am baby ferrets.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.982
Uh, I don't understand.It was simple.

07:41.025 --> 07:44.638
Just like Cambridge Analytica-
Facebook project.

07:44.681 --> 07:47.031
I target Luisa perfectly,

07:47.075 --> 07:49.077
get her to donate
to my charity,

07:49.120 --> 07:52.297
and now, I own hotel.

07:52.341 --> 07:55.083
For my freedom,

07:55.126 --> 07:56.911
I give back to you.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.219
Y-You're actually
considering this?

08:01.263 --> 08:02.873
I can't believe it.What? No, I-I wasn't...

08:02.917 --> 08:04.745
You were. I just saw you!I was... surprised.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.921
Yes.This guy just tried to kill you.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.966
No, I actually don't
think he'd kill me.He should be in prison.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.925
And the fact that
you just hesitated

08:10.968 --> 08:13.014
is exactly why
I can't be with you.

08:13.057 --> 08:15.799
No, don't-don't,
don't say that. I...

08:15.843 --> 08:17.366
I was just surprised, okay?

08:17.409 --> 08:18.933
Here, look,
I'm calling them now.

08:18.976 --> 08:21.718
Milos, you're going to jail.

08:21.762 --> 08:22.719
Oh...

08:22.763 --> 08:24.547
JANE:
Where is he?

08:24.591 --> 08:27.115
It's been over 30 minutes.
Do you think he got lost?

08:27.158 --> 08:29.160
Should we go look for him?

08:31.859 --> 08:37.081
I'm... sure that Jason is fine.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.909
He's just getting air.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.612
Hey, Petra.

08:47.614 --> 08:48.789
What?

08:48.832 --> 08:50.442
Okay, okay,
I'm coming.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.619
Huh?I have to go get the girls.

08:52.662 --> 08:53.924
Milos is back.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.926
Don't worry,
everything's okay.

08:55.970 --> 08:58.973
Oh, my God, okay. Of course, go.

08:59.016 --> 09:02.063
I should wait here for... him.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.768
I'm about ready to hit the hay.

09:54.811 --> 09:57.945
Point me towards
a motel?

09:57.988 --> 09:59.599
No, you should stay here.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.078
We'll all stay
at my abuela'splace.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.385
Okay. Just for tonight.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.169
Okay.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.389
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes,
how do you say good-bye

10:07.432 --> 10:10.218
to your ex-husband who recently returned from the dead?

10:12.176 --> 10:15.179
Awkward hug.
Good to know.

10:28.062 --> 10:29.280
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
When Rogelio de la Vega

10:29.324 --> 10:32.414
was 45... okay, 46 years old,

10:32.457 --> 10:35.722
he prepared himself to see his
best brogelio Michael again,

10:35.765 --> 10:38.463
after four long years.

10:38.507 --> 10:42.467
Can you move over,
like, a little?

10:42.511 --> 10:44.948
Now, Jane?
Mm-hmm?

10:44.992 --> 10:48.343
I want you to prepare yourself
for the possibility

10:48.386 --> 10:53.391
that once Michael sees me, his
memory might instantly return.

10:53.435 --> 10:54.784
Thanks for
the heads-up.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.700
You're welcome. I just
don't want you to be offended

10:57.744 --> 10:59.397
if/when that happens.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.312
RAFAEL:
You look pretty.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.358
Thank you.
Oh.

11:03.401 --> 11:06.491
I don't.  Do I?

11:06.535 --> 11:09.494
Just normal.

11:09.538 --> 11:13.890
So I, uh, I told Mateo we're
gonna delay our move a little.

11:13.934 --> 11:18.373
Our move in.
We're supposed to move in today.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.723
Yeah, but with everything
going on, I just...

11:20.767 --> 11:22.377
didn't think
it'd be the best day.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.379
Thank you.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.391
Ma'am.

11:36.434 --> 11:37.784
Just Xo is fine.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.438
Alba Villanueva.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.441
You can call me "ma'am."

11:44.791 --> 11:49.360
Does any of this
look familiar?

11:52.973 --> 11:54.322
No.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.540
Oh.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.328
Stay. It's okay.

12:00.371 --> 12:03.070
Actually,
this was your cat.

12:03.113 --> 12:06.203
Well, you can keep him.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.423
Her.
Either way,

12:08.466 --> 12:10.077
I'm not a cat person, so...

12:17.519 --> 12:18.738
Hi, there.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.740
Yes.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.481
It is me.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.832
And I have missed you.

12:29.052 --> 12:32.534
Um, how do we
know each other?

12:32.577 --> 12:33.883
Well, we are best friends.

12:33.927 --> 12:36.190
And also
I'm Jane's father.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.932

Rogelio de la Vega.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.122
Nothing?

12:55.165 --> 12:57.385
Sorry, sir.

12:57.428 --> 13:00.083
Okay.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.259
POLICE OFFICER:
We'll find him.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.391
Milos won't get near the hotel.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.523
Thank you.

13:07.438 --> 13:10.441
Don't be brave. Maybe sleep
somewhere else tonight.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.356
Your place?

13:12.400 --> 13:13.705
Sorry.

13:13.749 --> 13:16.578
I'll be fine. I-I hired
private security at night,

13:16.621 --> 13:20.495
and Raf's gonna keep the girls
till they catch him.

13:23.498 --> 13:26.153
J.R., wait.

13:26.196 --> 13:29.939
I'll come by to get my
stuff in a couple days.

13:29.983 --> 13:32.594
It would be better
if you weren't there.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.992
Stop her, please.

13:39.035 --> 13:41.255
She isn't a suspect.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.648
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
In the name of love?

13:43.692 --> 13:45.476
And speaking of love...

13:45.520 --> 13:46.869
Sorry, ma'am.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.436
It's Mom.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.264
It doesn't matter

13:50.307 --> 13:52.266
you don't remember me.

13:52.309 --> 13:55.269
I remember you.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.970
I can't believe you're alive.

14:01.014 --> 14:04.321
And I just love you so much.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.544
Now, we really need to get going
if we're gonna make it

14:09.587 --> 14:11.372
to the neurologist on time.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.591
Are you ready?

14:13.635 --> 14:14.984
You want me to come?

14:15.028 --> 14:16.812
Of course, Jane.

14:19.728 --> 14:20.903
Good luck.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.386
Mm.

14:27.605 --> 14:30.130
Well, we'll just see, I guess.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.567
Doctors perform miracles.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.960
I mean, if they can
erase crow's feet,

14:34.003 --> 14:35.962
surely they can recover
memories, right?

14:39.269 --> 14:41.228
Hello?Rogelio,

14:41.271 --> 14:43.665
you really need to be more
sensitive to Rafael's feelings.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.536
Think about how hard
this must be for him.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.452
Oh, my God. You're so right.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.367
I must be there for him.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.500
He must be going
through so much.

14:52.543 --> 14:53.805
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
True, for the record.

14:53.849 --> 14:56.330
Between Jane and Petra and...

14:56.373 --> 14:58.332
Luisa. How are you?

14:58.375 --> 15:00.377
NARRATOR: You remember
Rafael's sister, right?

15:00.421 --> 15:01.944
RAFAEL:
I am so sorry, again,

15:01.988 --> 15:03.685
for giving Rose your location.

15:03.728 --> 15:04.860
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Rose's former lover.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.688
No, I understand.

15:06.731 --> 15:09.647
I mean,
what choice did you have?

15:09.691 --> 15:11.998
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Luisa is also a vegan,

15:12.041 --> 15:13.521
although that information
is not relevant here.

15:13.564 --> 15:14.957
RAFAEL:
Did Rose make contact?

15:15.001 --> 15:17.133
She did.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.135
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
It is relevant here.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.921
I don't understand.
Why would she hide Michael

15:21.964 --> 15:23.792
and give him amnesia?

15:24.575 --> 15:26.621
She refused to say.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.275
Let me guess.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.538
She'll only tell me
if I go see her?

15:30.581 --> 15:32.366
RAFAEL:
I'd never ask you to do that.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.716
You need to get as far away
from her as possible.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.721
MICHAEL:
I don't remember anything.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.549
Understandable.

15:41.592 --> 15:46.467
The brain scans show evidence of
excessive ECT-- electroshock--

15:46.510 --> 15:48.599
primarily in the hippocampus
and the temporal lobe.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.993
Both play important roles
in memory processing.

15:51.037 --> 15:53.561
In particular,
amnesiac patients...

15:56.694 --> 15:59.393
MICHAEL:
Jane?

15:59.436 --> 16:01.047
Do I have something on my face?

16:01.090 --> 16:02.787
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, you have a little Michael

16:02.831 --> 16:04.964
on your face. No, no, nothing.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.835
PATRICIA:
So, what does this all mean?

16:06.878 --> 16:08.576
Will he get his memory back?

16:08.619 --> 16:10.273
Each case is different.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.058
There's so much we don't know

16:12.101 --> 16:13.581
about the brain.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.365
It's really not
an exact science.

16:15.409 --> 16:16.584
PATRICIA: Well,
what do we do?

16:16.627 --> 16:18.412
To help him?

16:18.455 --> 16:21.589
Hmm. I'd just say get
him back to a routine.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.808
Familiar people,
places, things...

16:23.852 --> 16:26.768
Okay. You can do that, right?

16:26.811 --> 16:28.422
Well, we sold the house

16:28.465 --> 16:31.686
after the divorce, and he's
not gonna recognize my condo.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.732
And you're his wife.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.606
JANE:
Right.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.651
Of course, I'll do it.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.698
Because I'm his wife.

16:51.749 --> 16:55.536
Uh, they don't know
if his memory will return.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.973
The brain
isn't an exact science.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.715
But maybe if he's
around familiar places,

17:00.758 --> 17:02.151
familiar things...

17:02.195 --> 17:05.067
So I'm going to take him around.

17:05.111 --> 17:08.070
Since I'm his wife.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.289
Hon.Hmm?

17:09.332 --> 17:11.639
You okay?

17:11.682 --> 17:14.424
Yeah.

17:14.468 --> 17:17.471
I think I'm just
going to write a little.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.257
Uh, y-you know, technically,

17:21.301 --> 17:24.391
I don't know if that's
even true-- the wife thing.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.610
I actually looked
on Google in the bathroom,

17:26.654 --> 17:28.090
and the law's a little unclear

17:28.134 --> 17:31.093
with regards
to thinking someone's dead

17:31.137 --> 17:32.877
and then them
coming back to life.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.097
Not a lot of precedent.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.404
But anyway, that's just,
like, legal stuff, so...

17:37.447 --> 17:39.058
I'm gonna write.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.060
Inhala, exhala.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.412
Actually, I'm gonna make
some tea first.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.849
That'll be comforting.

17:47.892 --> 17:50.460
Yeah. And...

17:52.158 --> 17:54.421
...and-and who cares
about the legal stuff?

17:54.464 --> 17:56.510
It's how I feel.

17:56.553 --> 17:59.034
Do I feel married or not?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.776
And no, I do not.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.126
Watching your husband's casket
get lowered into the ground

18:04.170 --> 18:05.519
makes you feel
not married anymore.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.956
And grieving him.

18:07.999 --> 18:11.351
And living every day
like he was dead for four years.

18:11.394 --> 18:14.441
But now he's back.
Or Jason's back, I should say.

18:14.484 --> 18:17.400
"Sorry, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am."

18:17.444 --> 18:19.315
I mean, that isn't Michael.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.012
That is some guy
who is wearing Michael's face

18:21.056 --> 18:24.451
and who smells exactly
like Michael.

18:24.494 --> 18:27.062
Exactly.

18:27.106 --> 18:31.762
He smells exactly like Michael.

18:31.806 --> 18:34.852
Exactly.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.854
But, no, b-but that
isn't Michael.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.900
That is Jason,

18:38.943 --> 18:41.424
who doesn't like jokes
and talks super slow

18:41.468 --> 18:43.687
and who can't look me
in the eye.

18:43.731 --> 18:46.690
I'm fine. I'm fine. It's fine.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.910
It's just a lot.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.955
That's why I should write.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.917
But what
will I even write about?

18:55.960 --> 18:57.658
I mean, what is the story
even about now?

18:57.701 --> 18:59.181
I had this big,
great breakthrough

18:59.225 --> 19:00.791
about the frame
and incorporating

19:00.835 --> 19:02.358
all the crazy stuff
that has happened in my life,

19:02.402 --> 19:04.273
and there has been
some really crazy stuff.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.188
Accidental
artificial insemination

19:06.232 --> 19:08.277
and kidnapped babies
and a dead husband,

19:08.321 --> 19:11.237
but now, guess what?
He's not a dead husband anymore.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.153
And obviously
that is a very easy detail

19:14.196 --> 19:16.894
to just change on the screen.
"And then my husband died."

19:16.938 --> 19:18.331
Delete, delete, delete. Done.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.202
Delete, delete, delete.
Not a widow.

19:20.246 --> 19:23.249
Delete. Not a widow. Delete.
Not a widow. Delete!

19:23.292 --> 19:26.034
And it's fine. I'm fine.

19:26.077 --> 19:29.690
The brain isn't
an exact science, right?

19:29.733 --> 19:34.260
It's just that you tell
all these stories...

19:34.303 --> 19:37.741
about yourself,
and that's who you are.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.787
You know, that's your identity.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.354
And I'm a widow.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.965
I-I mean,
that is not all that I am.

19:44.008 --> 19:46.750
I'm a mother and a daughter
and a published freakin' author,

19:46.794 --> 19:48.099
but under it all,
at the doctor's office,

19:48.143 --> 19:50.145
"single, married,
divorced, widow,"

19:50.189 --> 19:52.016
I circle "widow."

19:52.060 --> 19:54.018
But now guess what?

19:54.062 --> 19:56.717
I could circle "S" for "single."

19:56.760 --> 19:58.762
Or "M" for "married"?

20:01.200 --> 20:06.074
I was supposed to be getting
engaged last night to Rafael.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.164
Poor Rafael.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.385
Oh, he had to bring
Michael-Jason back

20:12.428 --> 20:13.951
knowing what it meant.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.779
And he starts
his new job tomorrow.

20:15.823 --> 20:20.001
For me. So that I can...
can stay at home and write.

20:20.044 --> 20:23.047
And we can live
in a good school district.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.270
What do I do about Mateo?
Do I tell him?

20:28.314 --> 20:29.837
What would I even say?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.447
"Heads-up, uh, Michael's back.

20:31.491 --> 20:34.233
But now he goes by Jason,
and he calls me ma'am."

20:34.276 --> 20:36.670
Ma'am.
Why does he call me ma'am?

20:36.713 --> 20:38.411
I'm 29 years old!

20:38.454 --> 20:42.371
Do I look like a frickin' ma'am
to you?!

20:42.415 --> 20:45.592
Well, if I do, it's his fault!
Because I aged when he died

20:45.635 --> 20:48.203
because life was really hard
and I was really sad!

20:48.247 --> 20:49.596
And I had to go
to grief support groups!

20:49.639 --> 20:51.119
And I don't know
why I'm yelling,

20:51.162 --> 20:52.207
because he didn't
do anything wrong

20:52.251 --> 20:53.817
and it's not his fault!

20:53.861 --> 20:57.691
The point is, is no,
I am not telling him.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.215
I can't tell Mateo.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.218
He won't handle it
as well as I am.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.307
Did you make those arepas?Uh...

21:05.351 --> 21:07.178
Can I eat them? Oh, goodness.

21:07.222 --> 21:09.311
Oh, I'm starving.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.313
Oh. Oh!

21:11.357 --> 21:13.533
: Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.
You know when you realize

21:13.576 --> 21:15.143
that you haven't eaten
in so many days?

21:15.186 --> 21:16.797
That's what this feels like
right now.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.582
Oh. Oh!

21:19.626 --> 21:22.193
Top-notch, Abuela. Okay.

21:22.237 --> 21:25.893
Maybe I'll get Cubanos tomorrow
so I can jog his memory.

21:25.936 --> 21:27.547
"Hey, remember me?" "No."

21:27.590 --> 21:30.463
"I got to walk Bo."

21:30.506 --> 21:32.334
Anyway, the point is,

21:32.378 --> 21:34.205
is that Bo is very important
to Michael-Jason.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.512
Okay? So... Oh.

21:36.556 --> 21:39.515
I'm sorry, Faith M. Whiskers.

21:39.559 --> 21:42.736
I know. Mm.

21:42.779 --> 21:46.392
Do you remember that person
that once loved you so much

21:46.435 --> 21:48.394
because he was a cat person?

21:48.437 --> 21:50.570
Well, guess what? You're out!

21:50.613 --> 21:52.354
Because now he likes dogs.

21:54.182 --> 21:57.185
Who's here? Abuela. Mm!

21:57.228 --> 21:59.405
Maybe yourdead husband's
coming back, too.

21:59.448 --> 22:02.625
Huh?

22:02.669 --> 22:05.324
Oh, my God. It's the movers.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.369
Shoot, okay.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.240
I am so sorry.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.504
I meant to call earlier.
We're actually not moving today

22:11.547 --> 22:13.506
because my husband
just came back from the dead.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.943
Excuse me, ma'am?Seriously?

22:15.986 --> 22:18.728
Seriously, with the ma'am?
I am not a ma'am. Jane.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.295
Hi. I'm Jane.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.123
Mom! Mom-- Mom.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.646
Can you deal
with the movers, please?

22:23.690 --> 22:26.432
They shouldn't say things
like ma'am,

22:26.475 --> 22:30.044
because it can
make people feel really bad.

22:30.087 --> 22:33.177
I'm fine. Abuela, I'm fine.

22:35.484 --> 22:38.313
Or maybe I'm not.
I don't know, Abuela.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.097
I don't.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.272
I should change, actually.

22:41.316 --> 22:42.622
I want to get into
some comfy clothes

22:42.665 --> 22:44.624
so that I...
I can write, finally.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.626
Inhala, exhala.Okay.

22:46.669 --> 22:50.281
Anyway, thank you for listening.

22:50.325 --> 22:53.633
I feel much better now.

22:55.461 --> 22:56.897
JANE:
I didn't realize

22:56.940 --> 22:59.856
how much I needed to
just walk through it.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.076
Okay. Oh, this
is better,

23:03.382 --> 23:04.861
I just needed to
get those pants off.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.428
Now I can
finally breathe.

23:06.472 --> 23:09.736
Ah-- and a-a big part of the
problem was those pants.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.086
And I just needed to get
out how crazy it is

23:12.129 --> 23:14.393
to look at someone who looks
exactly like the person

23:14.436 --> 23:16.569
that you got married to,
except remembers nothing

23:16.612 --> 23:19.789
and is a totally different
person with a dog named Bo.

23:19.833 --> 23:24.228
I think that I should prep
for tomorrow before I write.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.405
You know, figure ways
to help jog his memories.

23:28.232 --> 23:31.584
You know, I could
always call some of my friends

23:31.627 --> 23:33.412
whose husbands
came back from the dead.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.196
Or I can join

23:35.239 --> 23:37.459
a my-husband-came-back-
from-the-dead support group.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.896
Oh. Although, also,
I also need a sub-group

23:39.940 --> 23:42.290
for the whole amnesia thing.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.639
I need the amnesiac group

23:43.683 --> 23:46.468
for husbands
who came back from the dead.

23:46.512 --> 23:49.253
Why isn't this tea
done boiling?!

23:49.297 --> 23:51.473
It's like... Oh. Yeah? Nope.

23:51.517 --> 23:54.433
Forgot to turn it on.

23:54.476 --> 23:58.132
The brain isn't
an exact science.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.090
The point is...

24:00.134 --> 24:01.875
am I okay?

24:01.918 --> 24:03.529
Yeah.

24:03.572 --> 24:06.140
Yeah. I'd say,
considering everything...

24:06.183 --> 24:07.184
I'm doing great.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.803
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
In case you forgot,
Michael has amnesia

24:16.846 --> 24:18.457
and Jane is great.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.849
Thanks for doing this.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.851
Of course.
I just hope I can help.

24:21.895 --> 24:25.202
And our "Michael" tour starts
right here, actually.

24:25.246 --> 24:28.205
Because this is the exact spot
where we first met.

24:28.249 --> 24:30.033
You got me a stripper?!

24:30.077 --> 24:33.602
And then all my friends
dragged you into the house,

24:33.646 --> 24:36.736
and I grabbed your gun and I shot it into the ceiling,

24:36.779 --> 24:37.998
and we kissed,

24:38.041 --> 24:41.610
and we saw my mom drunk
on the porch swing.

24:41.654 --> 24:43.177
That's sad.
What?

24:43.220 --> 24:46.354
No. No, no, no, no,
it-it wasn't sad.

24:46.397 --> 24:48.487
I mean, maybe thatmoment was,

24:48.530 --> 24:51.577
but the rest was crazy and funny

24:51.620 --> 24:54.493
and magical and...

24:54.536 --> 24:56.146
Okay.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.408
Nothing here.

24:57.452 --> 24:59.846
Next stop: the Cubano truck.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.238
Never even heard of a Cubano.

25:01.282 --> 25:02.805
Well, trust me, you love them.

25:02.849 --> 25:05.329
Yeah, not for me.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.506
But wow, you really
wolfed yours down.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.333
You want the
rest of mine?

25:09.377 --> 25:11.727
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm good.

25:11.771 --> 25:15.470
So, you would drop me off
at work here.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.472
Sometimes you'd
pick me up after, too.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.169
Hmm.Uh, I remember

25:19.213 --> 25:23.696
once we had a fight, and you
made me this apology playlist.

25:23.739 --> 25:27.047
You got some good music
to kiss to in there?

25:27.090 --> 25:30.833
♪ It's time to walk away... Oh, yeah.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.922
I have the best music
to kiss to.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.925
♪ So, come on, let it go

25:35.969 --> 25:38.493
♪ Just let it be

25:38.537 --> 25:40.930
♪ Why don't you be you...

25:40.974 --> 25:42.497
Please take over his
chores. Thank you.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.281
Jane! Hi.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.762
Thank you so much for taking
the girls last-minute.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.590
Everything's
just been so crazy,

25:48.634 --> 25:49.983
with Milos
coming back and...

25:50.026 --> 25:50.853
and I've
actually been

25:50.897 --> 25:53.508
really upset...Uh, Petra?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.554
Oh. Oh.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.773
Michael.
I mean...

25:57.817 --> 25:59.732
Oh. Jason, right?Mm-hmm.

25:59.775 --> 26:02.038
Ah, Rafael filled me in,
but I spaced.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.344
Oh, wow,

26:03.387 --> 26:05.825
it's so good to see you.
Alive.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.261
Hi.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.915
Mm.

26:08.958 --> 26:09.959
PETRA:
Oh.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.091
This is amazing.

26:11.134 --> 26:12.527
Well, I know you
two have a lot

26:12.571 --> 26:14.747
to catch up on,
so I'll leave you guys to it.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.189
Did I ever have a thing
with her?

26:22.232 --> 26:25.409
No. You did not
"have a thing" with Petra.

26:25.453 --> 26:26.889
Really?
I feel like

26:26.933 --> 26:29.326
I remember something
when I look at her.

26:29.370 --> 26:31.502
Well, you did conspire
to cover up a crime with her.

26:31.546 --> 26:32.939
Maybe that's
what you're remembering.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.811
I'm sorry, ma'am.

26:35.855 --> 26:38.161
Um, Jane. Sorry.

26:56.092 --> 26:57.224
Whoa!

26:57.267 --> 26:58.007
Oh! Oh!

26:59.008 --> 27:00.488
N-No! Stop!

27:00.531 --> 27:04.100
Please. I, uh,
I just need some antibiotics.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.842
My arm is
very infected.

27:06.886 --> 27:09.105
Probably from spending
day and a half

27:09.149 --> 27:11.194
hiding inside stuffed animal.

27:11.238 --> 27:13.588
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That must have been
un-bear-able.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.156
No, please, don't
call police.

27:16.199 --> 27:18.332
Get me antibiotics.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.160
I'll give you
hotel shares

27:20.203 --> 27:21.422
for antibiotics.

27:21.465 --> 27:23.990
What do you have
to lose?

27:25.252 --> 27:27.341
Let's make a deal.

27:27.384 --> 27:29.822
ROGELIO:
The bear is too big.

27:29.865 --> 27:32.825
Without it, voilà!
I can close the box.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.957
I appreciate you helping
me pack, Rogelio,

27:35.001 --> 27:37.090
but I really don't
need a play-by-play.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.005
Noted.

27:39.048 --> 27:42.443
We could also talk
about our feelings, hmm?

27:42.486 --> 27:45.011
Again... no, thank you.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.013
Why won't you open up?

27:47.056 --> 27:48.754
Look, I get it.

27:48.797 --> 27:50.581
Michael's your boy.

27:50.625 --> 27:53.454
Your brogelio.That's true.

27:53.497 --> 27:56.239
But we also have
our special bond.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.763
Oh, come on.

27:57.806 --> 28:00.069
I love my relationship
with you.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.984
In fact, the more
we get to know each other,

28:02.028 --> 28:04.204
the more stuff I find
we have in common.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.293
Like...

28:06.336 --> 28:09.949
the love for fine
facial cream.

28:09.992 --> 28:12.386
A nice, deep

28:12.429 --> 28:14.388
V-neck.Rogelio,

28:14.431 --> 28:16.956
if you really want
to help me, just...

28:16.999 --> 28:20.742
keep packing while I
go pick up Mateo. Okay?

28:20.786 --> 28:22.178
Okay, yeah.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.527
Sure.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.399
MILOS:
So much pain.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.227
Stop whining and write.

28:32.232 --> 28:35.061
You got blood all over it.
This'll never hold up in court.

28:35.104 --> 28:38.194
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I don't think any of this
would hold up in court.

28:38.238 --> 28:39.587
But what do I know?

28:39.630 --> 28:41.545
Start again.But my arm!

28:41.589 --> 28:42.938
Do you want
the antibiotics or not?

28:42.982 --> 28:44.287
Okay, okay.

28:45.985 --> 28:48.248
By the way, I'm bisexual.

28:48.291 --> 28:49.989
It's you.Milos Dvoracek,
you have the right

28:50.032 --> 28:53.035
to remain silent.
You have a right

28:53.079 --> 28:54.950
to an attorney.
If you can't afford...What? What about our deal?

28:54.994 --> 28:56.343
There was no deal.

28:56.386 --> 28:57.779
I only made you write
the contract to buy time.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.563
Don't look so surprised, Milos.

28:59.607 --> 29:00.956
It's a classic
narrative device.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.089
Leave something out...

29:03.132 --> 29:05.178
change the whole story.

29:05.221 --> 29:07.746
Which brings us here... now.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.269
Okay. The story.

29:11.097 --> 29:13.534
So, we had just started dating,
and there was this guy, Sam,

29:13.577 --> 29:15.666
and even though I had already
ended things with him,

29:15.710 --> 29:17.233
you didn't know that,
so you were upset,

29:17.277 --> 29:19.061
but you wouldn't tell me
why you were upset,

29:19.105 --> 29:22.108
and I kept pretending
like I didn't notice,

29:22.151 --> 29:24.850
but I could only play
that game for so long.

29:24.893 --> 29:28.027
I haven't seen Sam since
you kissed me two weeks ago.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.332
Ah, thank God.

29:29.376 --> 29:32.118
I only want to be with you, too.

29:38.254 --> 29:41.649
So you were dating
someone else...

29:41.692 --> 29:44.130
and I didn't take
that as a red flag?

29:44.173 --> 29:46.132
There were no flags.

29:46.175 --> 29:48.656
Of any color.

29:48.699 --> 29:51.746
Because you liked me
so much, back then.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.140
You knew I was
the one for you.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.186
Hmm.

29:57.230 --> 30:00.973
That's a pretty judgmental
"hmm," if you ask me.

30:01.016 --> 30:03.802
And we also came back here
the night before you died,

30:03.845 --> 30:05.934
because it was
so special to us.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.719
Does any of this
ring a bell?

30:11.592 --> 30:14.334
Do you need
more time to think?

30:14.377 --> 30:15.378
No.

30:15.422 --> 30:17.380
You don't need
more time to think?

30:17.424 --> 30:20.209
No... it doesn't
ring a bell.

30:21.732 --> 30:24.213
But yes, I-I would
like a minute.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.138
I know it hasn't
technically been a minute,

30:36.182 --> 30:38.706
but is that just, like,
a figure of speech, or...

30:38.749 --> 30:42.101
do you actually need,
like, the full 60 seconds?

30:42.144 --> 30:44.930
I certainly wouldn't mind
the full 60 seconds.

30:44.973 --> 30:47.106
You do talk an awful lot.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.108
Well, excuse me.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.849
I'm just trying to help you.

30:50.892 --> 30:54.026
And frankly, I don't know how
to do that if I can't talk.

30:54.069 --> 30:57.029
Unless you just
want me to send you...
pictures and videos.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.988
Sure. That sounds
like a good idea.

31:00.032 --> 31:02.338
Well, let's do that,
and get out of here.

31:02.382 --> 31:03.252
Hmm.

31:21.662 --> 31:23.142
Ha. Hi, Jane.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.187
Say it. You love camping.

31:25.231 --> 31:29.017
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah. That was tough
for me, too.

31:31.802 --> 31:33.761
XIOMARA:
Hey, Jane.

31:33.804 --> 31:34.544
Huh?

31:34.588 --> 31:35.937
How'd it go with Michael?

31:38.200 --> 31:39.636
Janie?

31:43.684 --> 31:46.034
I feel like I've been erased.

31:49.864 --> 31:52.345
It's just gone.

31:52.388 --> 31:55.652
Everything we said,
everythingwe did.

31:55.696 --> 31:58.612
It's like it didn't happen.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.309
And I don't know...

32:00.353 --> 32:02.616
what to do or what to feel.

32:05.619 --> 32:08.100
Yeah. There's
no rule book

32:08.143 --> 32:10.537
on how to handle
something like this.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.408
No.

32:12.452 --> 32:14.671
Even logistically.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.935
Is he my husband?

32:16.978 --> 32:19.546
Do I move in with Rafael?

32:19.589 --> 32:22.027
Maybe... maybe that's wrong now,

32:22.070 --> 32:24.072
but...

32:24.116 --> 32:27.684
Oh, 48 hours ago,
he was gonna propose.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.512
Or I was gonna propose.

32:29.556 --> 32:31.688
One of us was gonna propose.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.696
What are you doing?

32:39.740 --> 32:41.524
Oh.

32:41.568 --> 32:45.789
I was just packing the drawers
a-and I saw the ring.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.488
Okay. Uh...

32:48.531 --> 32:50.055
It's so beautiful, Rafael.

32:50.098 --> 32:53.188
Small but mighty.

32:53.232 --> 32:55.582
Thank you.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.585
Hope I get to give it to her.

32:58.628 --> 33:01.196
Now, I'll just...Somehow, wearing this ring...

33:01.240 --> 33:04.373
I've just realized
how many plans you had.

33:04.417 --> 33:06.680
And you're
a wonderful dad.

33:06.723 --> 33:09.596
You and Jane
are a family.

33:09.639 --> 33:12.425
And I've come to love
the two of you together.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.862
Well, I appreciate that.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.607
Did you want to say
something else, or...?

33:20.650 --> 33:22.913
No, it's okay.

33:22.957 --> 33:24.393
You can.

33:24.437 --> 33:27.788
It's just really hard,
you know?

33:27.831 --> 33:28.919
With Michael's return.

33:28.963 --> 33:30.617
Or Jason's.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.445
Okay. Hey.
Come here.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.055
It's all right.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.491
It's okay.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.450
You are gonna get through this.

33:37.493 --> 33:38.581
This is silly.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.714
I should be supporting you.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.175
MICHAEL:
Hey there.

34:07.219 --> 34:08.394
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Easier said than done

34:08.437 --> 34:09.569
when your formerly dead husband

34:09.612 --> 34:11.484
keeps coming back.

34:16.576 --> 34:18.534
I don't have the videos yet.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.797
I'm working on it.
No, no.

34:20.841 --> 34:22.538
I-I felt bad
and I wanted to apologize.

34:22.582 --> 34:27.587
Um, I guess part of me thought
that if I figured out who I was,

34:27.630 --> 34:29.850
my memories would come
flooding back.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.547
Like in a movie.

34:31.591 --> 34:33.419
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or a telenovela.

34:33.462 --> 34:34.855
Uh, but they didn't.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.248
And it's not your fault,

34:36.291 --> 34:37.771
so I shouldn't be taking it out
on you,

34:37.814 --> 34:39.164
especially 'cause you're
just trying to help.

34:39.207 --> 34:40.991
And I also know

34:41.035 --> 34:42.384
that I'm blowing up your life,

34:42.428 --> 34:44.560
coming back like this.

34:44.604 --> 34:47.128
And I want you to know
it's not your responsibility.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.130
You can tell me to go away.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.523
I'll understand.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.655
And I practiced saying
all that real fast

34:52.699 --> 34:54.179
so you wouldn't be
frustrated with me.

34:55.832 --> 34:57.660
I'm serious, though.

34:57.704 --> 35:00.881
If you want me to go back
to Montana, just tell me.

35:00.924 --> 35:02.883
I'll go.

35:18.594 --> 35:19.769
Hey.

35:19.813 --> 35:21.684
Is everything okay?
Yeah.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.121
Rogelio's waiting in the car
for me.

35:23.164 --> 35:25.688
I just wanted to stop by
and apologize to you.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.168
I might have accidentally
sicced him on you all day.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.257
No. It's fine. We bonded.

35:29.301 --> 35:30.519
I heard.

35:32.782 --> 35:37.178
Also... you were there for me
when I needed it,

35:37.222 --> 35:40.181
so I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.666
I'm so scared, Xo.

35:46.709 --> 35:49.451
I don't want to lose her.

36:01.985 --> 36:04.249
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You'll recall
when we last saw Jane,

36:04.292 --> 36:06.555
she was at a crossroads...

36:06.599 --> 36:08.731
with her story.

36:16.304 --> 36:19.742
And friends,
she had to make a decision.

36:52.862 --> 36:55.778
The first time I met Michael,

36:55.822 --> 36:57.954
I felt my heart glow.

36:59.869 --> 37:03.264
I still...

37:04.744 --> 37:06.920
Uh...

37:14.014 --> 37:16.321
"I still remember
what I was wearing.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.584
"It was a pink dress.

37:18.627 --> 37:20.368
"Michael was wearing
his police uniform,

37:20.412 --> 37:21.761
"which I tried to take off him

37:21.804 --> 37:22.936
because I thought he was
a stripper."

37:24.459 --> 37:27.027
"Michael could always
make me laugh.

37:27.070 --> 37:28.811
"But I didn't love him
because he was funny,

37:28.855 --> 37:31.031
"or because he was smart
and kind.

37:31.074 --> 37:33.033
"I loved Michael because he was
my best friend.

37:34.861 --> 37:37.429
"And I am grateful
for every moment we shared

37:37.472 --> 37:40.388
"and for the privilege
of loving him.

37:40.432 --> 37:45.088
Because I never knew I could
love someone so much."

37:49.354 --> 37:51.443
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in that moment, friends,

37:51.486 --> 37:53.053
Jane knew what she had to do.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.363
Rafael.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.843
Jane. What are you doing here?

38:00.887 --> 38:03.846
Look, I know our lives are crazy
right now.

38:03.890 --> 38:06.980
And I wish I can tell Jason
to just go, but I can't.

38:07.023 --> 38:08.416
I have to help him get his
memory back,

38:08.460 --> 38:09.678
but you need to
know that I...
Jane.

38:09.722 --> 38:10.897
Yeah?

38:10.940 --> 38:12.333
It's my first day of work.

38:12.377 --> 38:16.076
Can we, uh,
do this outside?

38:16.119 --> 38:18.731
Of course. Sorry.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.953
I look forward
to getting to know you all.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.694
So what I was trying to say

38:25.738 --> 38:28.001
is that I rescheduled the
movers for later today.

38:28.044 --> 38:30.351
Because I want to move in with
you now, not in a few weeks,

38:30.395 --> 38:31.874
not when things
settle down

38:31.918 --> 38:34.181
because things never
seem to settle down.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.924
And I also wanted
to say thank you.

38:37.967 --> 38:40.448
Because when I think
about what you did,

38:40.492 --> 38:43.103
bringing Michael back,
and how selfless that is,

38:43.146 --> 38:45.540
and how selfless you've
been throughout this,

38:45.584 --> 38:50.110
and every day for
the past four years...

38:50.153 --> 38:52.591
I love you, Rafael.

38:52.634 --> 38:54.506
And I know it feels like
everything has changed,

38:54.549 --> 38:55.898
but it didn't.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.987
Not that.

39:00.207 --> 39:02.383
Mm.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.128
We are going
to get through this.

39:08.171 --> 39:09.651
We are.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.827
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which of course was the story

39:11.871 --> 39:13.612
they were telling themselves.

39:15.265 --> 39:17.137
But stories, as we know,

39:17.180 --> 39:18.617
don't always go
the way we hope.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.662
Oh, hi.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.231
I-I thought
you were out, so...

39:24.274 --> 39:25.841
The-- Uh, the girls are.

39:25.885 --> 39:28.409
My, uh, my plans changed.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.497
Okay. I'll come back.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.673
No, wait. I...

39:33.153 --> 39:35.068
Please.

39:35.111 --> 39:36.765
Give me another chance.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.204
Look, I've made mistakes, okay?

39:41.248 --> 39:44.512
But we can put all that
behind us... start over.

39:44.556 --> 39:46.384
Have a normal life.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.431
Okay. Semi-normal.

39:50.475 --> 39:52.128
That's not what this
is about.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.913
You lied to me.

39:53.956 --> 39:57.525
Because I've had to lie
my whole life.

39:57.569 --> 40:01.050
And manipulate, and cheat,

40:01.094 --> 40:04.750
just to survive my crazy mother,
and my psychotic sister,

40:04.793 --> 40:07.143
and my violent
ex-husband.

40:07.187 --> 40:09.015
And, yes, those things made me
who I am.

40:09.058 --> 40:11.321
And would I prefer
to forget all of them? Sure.

40:11.365 --> 40:13.062
But how can I?

40:13.106 --> 40:15.282
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Besides electroshock therapy,

40:15.325 --> 40:18.154
centered on the hippocampus
and the temporal lobe.

40:18.198 --> 40:19.547
You can't.

40:19.591 --> 40:20.983
Yeah. Exactly.

40:21.027 --> 40:22.942
But I can tell you this:

40:22.985 --> 40:26.511
I have changed a lot.

40:26.554 --> 40:29.470
Before I met you, I would have
taken those hotel shares

40:29.514 --> 40:31.211
without a second thought.

40:31.254 --> 40:32.908
And I wouldn't now.

40:32.952 --> 40:34.475
And I'm going
to change more.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.782
I want to.

40:38.305 --> 40:42.222
That's great...
and I hope you do.

40:42.265 --> 40:45.138
But I can't wait
for that to happen.

40:45.181 --> 40:49.055
Because I can't forget
everything either.

40:49.098 --> 40:50.535
Wait, stop.

40:55.191 --> 40:58.412
I love you.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.459
I know.

41:03.025 --> 41:04.505
JANE:
Star Wars.

41:04.549 --> 41:07.029
That was your favorite movie.
The second one.

41:07.073 --> 41:09.684
Thanks, I'll check it out.

41:09.728 --> 41:12.513
And there and photos and videos
you can go through on this.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.167
Thank you.

41:14.210 --> 41:15.560
What is it?

41:15.603 --> 41:18.519
A flash drive.

41:18.563 --> 41:21.174
You are the only person I know
who doesn't own a computer.

41:21.217 --> 41:24.046
Mm. You're the only person I
know who doesn't own a horse.

41:24.090 --> 41:26.571
There you go.

41:26.614 --> 41:29.095
Um, just press the spacebar
and they'll play.

41:29.138 --> 41:31.271
And take your time,
I'm gonna go for a walk.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.491
Thank you.
Sorry. Um...

41:33.534 --> 41:35.362
The space bar is which one?

41:37.190 --> 41:38.844
I'll help you.

41:42.282 --> 41:44.806
MICHAEL :
Hi, Jane.

41:44.850 --> 41:46.678
Smile.

41:46.721 --> 41:48.854
Is this a video?

41:48.897 --> 41:50.943
No. D-- Michael,
don't take a video.MICHAEL: Ladies and gentlemen,

41:50.986 --> 41:53.249
I'm trying to do
laundry over here.this newcomer is magic.

41:53.293 --> 41:55.164
Watch what
Villanueva's doing now.

41:55.208 --> 41:58.124
She is folding that sleeve
with total precision.

41:58.167 --> 42:00.039
That Michael guy
was pretty funny.

42:00.082 --> 42:01.954
Well, you definitely thought so.

42:01.997 --> 42:03.825
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hmm. For a second,

42:03.869 --> 42:06.654
that felt like the old
Jane and Michael.

42:06.698 --> 42:08.743
Then again, what do I know?

42:08.787 --> 42:10.223
Besides the story.

42:10.266 --> 42:12.530
Which brings me
to the phone ringing.

42:14.357 --> 42:16.229
Luisa? Are you okay?

42:16.272 --> 42:20.363
Yes. But I want to help you
find out why Rose took Michael.

42:20.407 --> 42:22.365
Hey, I told you,
you don't have to do this.

42:22.409 --> 42:24.063
That's exactly why I want
to help.

42:24.106 --> 42:25.586
Because you didn't ask.

42:25.630 --> 42:28.937
So I'm going to Rose.

42:28.981 --> 42:31.418
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which, of course,
brings us to...

42:31.461 --> 42:34.160
Hello, angels. I'm Charlie.

42:34.203 --> 42:37.990
Just kidding, I'm Rose.
AKA Sin Rostro.

42:38.033 --> 42:40.166
Thank you for accepting
this assignment.

42:40.209 --> 42:44.605
Now, let's get to work.

42:45.867 --> 42:47.260
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh.

42:47.303 --> 42:49.392
I wonder what the story
is here.
