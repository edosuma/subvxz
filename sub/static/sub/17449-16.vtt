WEBVTT

00:03.041 --> 00:05.041
Guys, I need to tell you something,

00:05.125 --> 00:07.333
but you have to promise
not to make fun of me.

00:07.417 --> 00:09.917
I won't make fun of you.
I'll make fun of him instead.

00:11.542 --> 00:12.709
Nice shirt, Oliver.

00:12.792 --> 00:15.333
What time is barbershop quartet practice?

00:16.792 --> 00:18.458
Very funny, Kaz.

00:18.542 --> 00:20.709
And practice is at 6:30 just like always.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.041
Anyway, for a while, I've suspected

00:24.125 --> 00:26.291
that superheroes are real.

00:26.375 --> 00:27.875
But now I know I'm right.

00:27.959 --> 00:29.458
(nervous chuckle)

00:29.542 --> 00:31.083
Superheroes real?

00:31.166 --> 00:33.458
(voice cracking)
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.

00:33.542 --> 00:35.208
Why are you acting so nervous?

00:35.291 --> 00:36.500
Me, nervous?

00:36.583 --> 00:38.625
(voice cracking)
The craziest thing I ever heard.

00:39.917 --> 00:44.333
The truth is,
Oliver is nervous because, uh...

00:45.542 --> 00:47.625
because he really
wants to go out with you.

00:48.792 --> 00:51.166
He is madly in love with you.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.166
Tell her, Oliver.

00:55.041 --> 00:57.417
Uh, yes, that's...

00:57.500 --> 00:58.875
exactly why I'm nervous.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.625
Jordan, would you do me the honor

01:00.709 --> 01:02.125
of going out with me?

01:02.208 --> 01:03.291
No.

01:04.333 --> 01:06.625
Anyway, I knew
you two wouldn't believe my theory,

01:06.709 --> 01:08.875
so this morning, I took this picture.

01:11.125 --> 01:13.208
I'm telling you,
this guy is Captain Atomic,

01:13.291 --> 01:15.208
and I'm gonna find him and prove it.

01:15.291 --> 01:18.083
Jordan, please, this is a huge city.

01:18.166 --> 01:21.041
You'll probably never
even see that guy again.

01:21.125 --> 01:22.625
Oh, there he is.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.000
What's buzzin', cousin?

01:26.083 --> 01:29.000
I'm your new history teacher, Mr. Camito.

01:30.166 --> 01:32.583
Mr. Camito. Our new history teacher.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.625
(voice cracking)
Craziest thing I ever heard.

Captain Atomic, what are you doing here?

02:31.417 --> 02:34.041
There's been a lot of chatter
about villain activity in this area.

02:34.125 --> 02:35.542
I'm here undercover to make sure

02:35.625 --> 02:39.333
the school is safe
from no-good ne'er-do-wells.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.875
Okay, if you're gonna stick around,

02:43.959 --> 02:45.333
you need to keep a low profile.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.000
Yeah, because our friend Jordan

02:48.083 --> 02:50.208
is convinced that you're Captain Atomic.

02:50.291 --> 02:52.750
I read you two loud and clear.

02:52.834 --> 02:54.959
Except you. You kinda mumble a bit.

02:57.917 --> 03:00.542
Gus, do you have
a metal detector I can borrow?

03:00.625 --> 03:03.333
That's insane.
Why would I have a metal detector?

03:04.125 --> 03:06.166
I have a lie detector,

03:06.250 --> 03:08.458
a radiation detector,

03:08.542 --> 03:10.208
-and a detector detector...
-(beeping)

03:10.291 --> 03:13.500
...which is going off right now
because it detects these other detectors.

03:14.208 --> 03:16.333
Give me the radiation detector.

03:16.417 --> 03:18.458
I'm going to prove that the new teacher

03:18.542 --> 03:20.000
is actually Captain Atomic.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.291
His atomic batteries should set this off.

03:22.375 --> 03:23.500
This again?

03:23.583 --> 03:26.083
If you're just trying to get attention,
there are better ways.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.041
I'm not trying to get attention.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.834
-(beeping)
-My lie detector says otherwise.

03:33.583 --> 03:36.709
-(loud beeping)
-Ha! I knew it!

03:36.792 --> 03:39.083
You have high levels of radiation
emanating from you.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.542
You are Captain Atomic.

03:40.625 --> 03:43.333
(scoffs) That doesn't prove anything.

03:43.417 --> 03:46.166
I mean, this whole city
is filled with radiation.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.583
See?

03:47.667 --> 03:51.125
Beep-beep, beep, beep-beep.

03:51.208 --> 03:52.875
You're making a beeping sound
with your mouth.

03:52.959 --> 03:54.667
Uh, yeah, because

03:54.750 --> 03:57.458
that's the first sign of radiation,

03:57.542 --> 03:59.583
involuntary mouth-beeping.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.208
(both making beeping sounds)

04:01.291 --> 04:03.667
Beep, beep, beep.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.875
(all beeping)

04:05.959 --> 04:08.834
Fine. Let's see how it works
on somebody else,

04:08.917 --> 04:11.041
like Principal Howard.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.208
(beeping)

04:16.291 --> 04:17.500
Why is it going off?

04:17.583 --> 04:20.959
(gasps) My experimental plutonium heart.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.750
You made it malfunction.

04:23.625 --> 04:25.083
Why would you do this?

04:27.959 --> 04:29.875
(bell rings)

04:29.959 --> 04:31.208
Gotta go.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.208
Horace, the Mighty Med cafeteria gave me

04:41.291 --> 04:42.667
the wrong lunch again.

04:42.750 --> 04:43.792
How do I know?

04:43.875 --> 04:46.083
Because this lunch is trying to eat me.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.583
(growling)

04:51.625 --> 04:52.750
Ah!

04:54.125 --> 04:56.542
Give it up, Connie. I know your secret.

04:56.625 --> 04:58.500
What are you talking about?

04:58.583 --> 05:01.291
You know how I do extensive background
checks on everyone at school

05:01.375 --> 05:03.500
so I can find out
their most embarrassing secrets

05:03.583 --> 05:05.417
and then bend them to my will?

05:06.083 --> 05:07.667
Here's your dry cleaning, Stephanie.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.208
Good. Your secret's safe with me,

05:09.291 --> 05:10.667
Mr. Still Bites His Nails.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.083
On His Feet.

05:13.083 --> 05:16.000
Can I help it if I'm limber
and have delicious toenails?

05:18.083 --> 05:19.041
Anyway...

05:19.125 --> 05:20.875
when I did my internet check on you,

05:20.959 --> 05:23.458
I found out there is no Connie Valentine.

05:23.542 --> 05:24.625
It's a fake identity.

05:24.709 --> 05:27.417
-It's not what you think.
-It's exactly what I think.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.500
You're not who you say you are.

05:29.583 --> 05:30.792
You're actually...

05:32.083 --> 05:33.542
a princess from another country

05:33.625 --> 05:35.458
who's here living in hiding.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.250
Dang it.

05:38.917 --> 05:41.208
Oh, my secret is out.

05:41.291 --> 05:42.834
I am a princess in hiding.

05:42.917 --> 05:45.542
Huh. If anyone here
was a princess in hiding,

05:45.625 --> 05:47.166
I would've guessed it was Genevieve.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.291
Nope. She's just weird.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.667
Why are you in hiding?

05:57.750 --> 06:00.875
Uh... because my father,

06:00.959 --> 06:03.583
the king of Calderania,

06:04.250 --> 06:06.583
was overthrown by...

06:07.375 --> 06:09.667
rebels, and he sent me here

06:09.750 --> 06:12.250
for safety
as he fights to regain his crown.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.291
I knew it.

06:13.375 --> 06:15.208
It all makes perfect sense now.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.458
It does?

06:17.542 --> 06:20.667
Yes. It explains why you dress
and act like such a dork.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.542
To not seem like royalty.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.333
Yes.

06:25.417 --> 06:28.208
That's exactly why I'm such a dork.

06:28.291 --> 06:30.083
On purpose.

06:31.083 --> 06:34.000
Anyway, you both have to keep my secret,

06:34.083 --> 06:35.750
or I could be in great danger.

06:35.834 --> 06:36.959
Oh, I will...

06:37.041 --> 06:38.500
if you make me a duchess.

06:38.583 --> 06:41.750
I want people to bow down
before me like I'm royalty.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.625
People already bow down to you.

06:43.709 --> 06:46.542
Yeah, but I want them to be,
like, royally forced to.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.709
I would love to make you a duchess,

06:50.792 --> 06:52.041
but I can't.

06:52.125 --> 06:55.625
It's an honor only bestowed upon
the most worthy individuals.

06:55.709 --> 06:57.750
Then I'll prove to you how worthy I am.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.834
I'll start by showering you with gifts.

06:59.917 --> 07:02.542
Give the royal highness your lunch. Now.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.291
Fine.

07:04.375 --> 07:05.875
It's a BLT.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.041
Bacon, lettuce and toenails.

07:09.542 --> 07:11.542
You don't like bacon?

07:17.750 --> 07:19.291
We dodged a bullet,

07:19.375 --> 07:22.875
but it's only a matter of time
till Jordan figures out that Mr. Camito

07:22.959 --> 07:25.667
is a superhero from the 1950's.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.834
He keeps referring to all the computers

07:27.917 --> 07:30.792
as "those fancy radios."

07:31.917 --> 07:34.125
Hey, we could try to get him fired.

07:35.041 --> 07:38.125
But the only person who can fire
a teacher is Principal Howard.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.542
Wait a minute.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.458
(whispers) I think I know what to do.

07:42.542 --> 07:45.208
-(whispering) Nice of you to whisper.
-Thanks. You too.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.333
Okay, what's the idea?

07:49.625 --> 07:52.375
Excuse me, Principal Howard.
Can I talk to you about something?

07:52.458 --> 07:54.959
I'm having a personal problem.

07:55.041 --> 07:57.125
Kaz, you can always talk to me...

07:57.208 --> 07:58.834
during my office hours,

07:58.917 --> 08:01.041
which are between 11:30 and 11:45.

08:01.125 --> 08:04.000
Every other Thursday. In May.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.542
Please, please.

08:05.625 --> 08:07.166
It'll just take a minute.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.959
So I'm trying to impress a girl.

08:10.041 --> 08:14.667
Of course, the best way to do that
is with an impression of a robot.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.750
Go on.

08:19.041 --> 08:22.875
Unfortunately, I'm terrible
at robot impressions.

08:22.959 --> 08:26.375
And I just remembered
you did such a good robot dance

08:26.458 --> 08:28.458
at the staff talent show.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.875
So will you help me, Principal Howard?

08:31.959 --> 08:33.834
I think you mean...

08:33.917 --> 08:36.625
Principal Boogie Bot 3000.

08:36.709 --> 08:39.500
(making robotic noises)

08:39.583 --> 08:42.083
Thank you. Okay...

08:43.542 --> 08:45.125
Fifty stars?

08:45.208 --> 08:46.166
Since when?

08:47.250 --> 08:48.625
There you are.

08:48.709 --> 08:51.291
You were right.
There is evil in this school.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.583
-Gee whillikers.
-And get this.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.291
It's Principal Howard.
He's some kind of robot villain,

08:56.375 --> 08:58.834
and he's shut down
all telecommunications worldwide.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.333
I'll call the League of Heroes.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.709
Ah, I forgot.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.750
He shut down
all telecommunications worldwide.

09:06.875 --> 09:09.709
You know,
I was also hoping to impress the girl

09:09.792 --> 09:11.417
by trying to rip her arms off,

09:11.500 --> 09:13.375
as robots tend to do.

09:13.458 --> 09:14.667
I totally get it.

09:15.375 --> 09:16.834
Watch and learn.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.709
What are you doing?

09:25.792 --> 09:27.458
Get off of me!

09:27.542 --> 09:30.041
Not until I unhinge your robot head.

09:31.792 --> 09:33.667
I'm not an actual robot.

09:34.709 --> 09:37.333
I was just doing
a masterful impression of one.

09:37.959 --> 09:39.083
Lies.

09:39.166 --> 09:41.542
I have proof that you
shut down all telephone devices

09:41.625 --> 09:43.041
in the world.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.834
(cell phone ringing)

09:48.959 --> 09:50.625
I'm sorry, I can't right now.

09:50.709 --> 09:52.750
I'm talking to a crazy person.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.125
Well, in my defense,

09:56.208 --> 09:58.041
that was a pretty
masterful robot impression.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.250
Listen, we all make mistakes.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.542
Just not as stupid
as this one so you're fired.

10:05.959 --> 10:07.041
Get out.

10:13.041 --> 10:15.625
Well, looks like that teacher is...

10:16.166 --> 10:17.542
history.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.667
'Cause he taught history,
and now he's gone.

10:21.375 --> 10:22.834
(both) Yeah, we got it.

10:28.917 --> 10:30.917
Ew, gross.

10:31.667 --> 10:32.625
You don't like sushi?

10:32.709 --> 10:33.875
Oh, I love sushi.

10:33.959 --> 10:35.750
I hate your shoes.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.000
Very clever.

10:38.083 --> 10:41.417
No one would expect a princess
to wear something that hideous.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.709
Exactly what I was goin' for.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.500
Hideous.

10:48.417 --> 10:51.667
Wait. I figured out a way
to prove my duchess-ness.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.208
I applied for Dutch citizenship.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.750
And I also got you a bodyguard.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.750
This really isn't necessary.

11:04.834 --> 11:06.500
I just wanna eat my lunch in peace.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.583
No!

11:09.417 --> 11:10.625
You can't eat that.

11:10.709 --> 11:13.500
The Calderanian rebels
might be trying to poison you.

11:13.583 --> 11:15.583
I need to taste it first.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.333
It's good.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.166
It's really good.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.667
It's not toenail good, but it'll do.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.000
If you like, I'd be happy
to write you a recommendation.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.709
If you wanna be admitted
to a mental institution.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.375
People are so much meaner
now than they were in the 1950's.

11:53.291 --> 11:55.834
Boss, this is unit 238.

11:55.917 --> 11:58.083
Captain Atomic is no longer a threat.

11:58.166 --> 12:00.125
I've downloaded your final instructions

12:00.208 --> 12:01.792
onto my memory drive.

12:01.875 --> 12:04.000
I am installing them now.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.542
Aha!

12:08.625 --> 12:10.458
You were talking about Captain Atomic.

12:10.542 --> 12:13.083
I was right. Superheroes do exist.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.667
So the fact that I just put
a flash drive into my head,

12:15.750 --> 12:17.208
you're not gonna comment on that?

12:18.291 --> 12:21.000
I just have to take a picture.
I knew superheroes were real.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.834
Unfortunately for you,

12:27.500 --> 12:29.417
so are super villains.

12:34.291 --> 12:37.750
So, are you one
of the normos from Mighty Med,

12:37.834 --> 12:40.750
or do you work for the League of Heroes?

12:40.834 --> 12:42.458
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:42.542 --> 12:45.709
But it's so cool how your eyes
turn red when you get angry.

12:45.792 --> 12:48.208
Let's see how cool you think it is

12:48.291 --> 12:50.917
when I destroy you, like this.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.458
Oh, hi, Jordan, hey, Principal Howard.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.917
Cool melted globe. What's going on?

13:04.041 --> 13:05.083
Uh...

13:05.166 --> 13:07.792
rope-tying class. It's a new elective.

13:09.792 --> 13:11.959
And I'm really bad at it.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.500
I need... help!

13:13.583 --> 13:15.250
A lot of... help.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.959
You really do. With your blinking,

13:19.041 --> 13:21.125
because you're only doing it
with one eye right now.

13:23.375 --> 13:26.125
(beeping)

13:26.208 --> 13:29.166
Huh. My robot detector is going off,

13:29.250 --> 13:31.834
which can only mean one thing.

13:33.166 --> 13:35.750
The battery's low.
I better go change it. See ya.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.041
Now where were we?

13:43.125 --> 13:44.625
You were about to let me go.

13:44.709 --> 13:46.959
Oh, okay, let me untie those... Hey!

13:48.709 --> 13:50.583
I'm not finished.

13:50.667 --> 13:53.583
Now I know you're one of the two kids

13:53.667 --> 13:57.083
at this school who work
at the superhero hospital, Mighty Med.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.417
Two kids.

13:58.500 --> 14:01.125
Of course. Oliver and Kaz.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.333
That's where they go
after school every day.

14:03.417 --> 14:05.166
Oliver and Kaz.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.458
Thank you for that information.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.458
I need to make sure it's them

14:09.542 --> 14:11.583
before I take them to my superior.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.375
Take your phone.

14:14.458 --> 14:15.959
Start a video chat with Kaz.

14:16.041 --> 14:17.959
It's 4:00 p.m.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.834
They could be at Mighty Med right now.
I wanna see.

14:20.917 --> 14:22.417
You should use my laptop.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.458
It's got a bigger screen. I'll go get it.

14:24.542 --> 14:27.917
Great. You know what?
That's why you are my favorite... Stop it!

14:33.917 --> 14:36.583
(phone rings)

14:36.667 --> 14:39.458
-Hello.
-Hey, Kaz, it's Principal Howard.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.333
Principal Howard.

14:41.417 --> 14:43.959
If this is about the fake vomit
on your desk,

14:44.041 --> 14:45.542
I didn't put it there.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.208
I only use real vomit.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.041
When I pull a prank, I commit.

14:50.166 --> 14:51.959
I'm actually calling to apologize

14:52.041 --> 14:54.250
about Mr. Camito's behavior earlier.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.375
Would you mind filming the entire room

14:56.458 --> 14:59.125
so that I can make sure that you're safe,

14:59.208 --> 15:01.000
and that Oliver isn't traumatized?

15:01.083 --> 15:04.500
Actually, Oliver is extremely traumatized,

15:04.583 --> 15:08.333
and, uh, he's crying uncontrollably,

15:08.417 --> 15:10.375
like a big baby.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.166
Better go get him a pacifier.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.125
So what if I'm crying?

15:16.208 --> 15:18.667
Anyone who can watch a video of a soldier

15:18.750 --> 15:20.792
reuniting with his dog and not cry

15:20.875 --> 15:22.417
is a cold-blooded monster.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.125
No offense, Lizard Man.

15:27.583 --> 15:30.333
Listen, Principal Howard is a villain,
and he's got Jordan.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.166
We have to rescue her,
we're gonna need help.

15:34.792 --> 15:37.041
Captain Atomic
is the only superhero around.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.041
I hope he's not still mad at us.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.250
Go away. I'm still mad at you.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.875
Because of you,
I can't complete my mission.

15:44.959 --> 15:47.125
Listen, we're really sorry.

15:47.208 --> 15:49.125
The chatter
that you've been hearing is true.

15:49.208 --> 15:51.291
Principal Howard really is a villain.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.166
And in other gossip,

15:53.250 --> 15:56.542
apparently Oliver
has a huge crush on Jordan.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.291
You started that rumor.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.709
And it took off like wildfire.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.375
I knew Principal Howard was a villain.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.500
To the school...

16:07.583 --> 16:08.667
But you walk.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.458
I'm still mad at you.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.291
Look, since I don't know anything,

16:19.375 --> 16:20.458
can't you just let me go?

16:20.542 --> 16:22.000
I'm afraid not.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.083
And since you know my secret,

16:24.166 --> 16:26.208
I'm going to have to destroy you.

16:26.291 --> 16:27.583
In a classroom?

16:27.667 --> 16:30.709
Shouldn't you lower me into a shark tank
or snake pit or something?

16:30.792 --> 16:32.875
Why don't you go set
that up and I'll meet you there?

16:32.959 --> 16:34.166
That's actually a good idea.

16:34.250 --> 16:35.917
Ah, cut it out!

16:40.917 --> 16:42.667
Unhand that girl!

16:42.750 --> 16:44.834
I don't mean yank her hands off.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.500
I mean... you know what I mean!

17:03.834 --> 17:05.875
Jordan, I know this looks odd,

17:05.959 --> 17:08.250
but there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation for this.

17:08.959 --> 17:10.291
Oliver has a crush on you.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.542
How could that be an explanation for this?

17:17.709 --> 17:18.917
Jordan, run.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.125
We've gotta help him.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.625
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

17:45.709 --> 17:47.375
Principal Howard is
a rebel from Calderania

17:47.458 --> 17:50.041
trying to attack the princess.

17:52.333 --> 17:53.500
Stephanie, Gus, run.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.500
Connie, I'm not going anywhere.

17:55.583 --> 17:58.792
As your royal bodyguard,
I will never leave you in danger.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.750
I officially tender my resignation.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.583
Hey, nobody hurts my princess.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.208
Stephanie, wait for me in the courtyard.

18:22.291 --> 18:23.458
Yes, milady.

18:29.333 --> 18:30.834
We've gotta stop him.

18:30.917 --> 18:34.709
Wait. Remember that comic
about the rise of the cabal of chaos?

18:34.792 --> 18:37.375
I think Principal Howard
is the same model android.

18:37.458 --> 18:40.125
Captain Atomic, remove
the flash drive from behind his ear.

18:40.208 --> 18:42.291
All right. One question.

18:42.375 --> 18:44.000
What's a flash drive?

19:21.458 --> 19:23.917
Well, we better take our headmaster

19:24.000 --> 19:26.583
to Mighty Max prison for detention.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.208
'Cause he's just a head, and detention

19:29.291 --> 19:31.542
-is another word for...
-(all) Yeah, we got it.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.583
Jordan.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.250
Are you okay?

19:39.333 --> 19:41.500
I'm a little groggy, but I'm fine.

19:41.583 --> 19:43.583
(Howard) Ew.

19:43.667 --> 19:44.792
There's old socks in here.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.083
You're probably wondering
what that whole scene was about.

19:49.166 --> 19:50.625
Yeah, what happened here?

19:50.709 --> 19:52.917
I can't remember anything.

19:54.750 --> 19:57.083
Uh, I can't remember anything either.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.166
Yeah, neither can I.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.583
It must be the radiation.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.333
(both beeping)

20:07.458 --> 20:10.333
Stephanie,
that was an amazing display of bravery.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.458
I can't believe you risked
your high-heeled wedges for me.

20:13.542 --> 20:15.542
Well, I already wore them twice,

20:15.625 --> 20:17.417
so I was gonna throw them out anyway.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.041
So now can I become a member

20:20.125 --> 20:21.667
of the Calderanian royalty?

20:22.750 --> 20:23.709
Sure.

20:23.792 --> 20:24.792
Why not?

20:26.000 --> 20:30.041
I now dub thee
Duchess Stephanie of Calderania.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.583
You may rise.

20:31.667 --> 20:33.792
But I'm already standing.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.750
I know. They just always say that.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.417
This is so exciting.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.166
I can't wait to tell
everyone I'm a duchess,

20:40.250 --> 20:42.417
and make them feel
even worse about themselves.

20:43.291 --> 20:45.166
No, you can't tell anyone.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.875
-Why not?
-Because...

20:48.834 --> 20:50.417
you wouldn't be safe.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.792
No one can ever know about this.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.375
Right.

20:54.458 --> 20:55.500
Sorry, Gus.

20:56.375 --> 20:57.750
I'm gonna have to execute you.

20:57.834 --> 20:59.917
-(screams)
-Stop!

21:00.000 --> 21:01.875
Gus can know.

21:01.959 --> 21:04.291
Nobody ever believes what he says anyway.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.834
Gee, I wonder why.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.542
I detect a hint of sarcasm.

21:08.625 --> 21:10.542
(beeping)

21:10.625 --> 21:13.917
Yep, my sarcasm detector is going crazy.

21:17.959 --> 21:20.542
(theme music plays)

21:41.959 --> 21:43.291
(boing)

21:46.875 --> 21:47.959
(boy) Yes!
