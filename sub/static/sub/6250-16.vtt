34:20.142 --> 34:22.884
That would explain what happened
to Alex Newcomb’s bones.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.390
So we got blood.
We got a method ofdisposing the body.

34:25.481 --> 34:28.598
- Looks like you’re gonna have
to shut thejungle down, pal.
- [ Groans ] Why?

34:28.692 --> 34:31.183
Because everyone
who works here is now a suspect.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.152
Including you,junglejim.

34:40.955 --> 34:43.412
[ Woman]
Here you go.

34:43.499 --> 34:46.457
So, the blood from junglejim’s
is a match for Alex Newcomb.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.204
He was killed
in the service area.

34:48.295 --> 34:51.662
He was killed and then soaked
in corrosive tire cleaner.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.918
So, the killer thinks the body’s
gonna dissolve instantly...

34:54.009 --> 34:55.965
like it does in the mo vies,
then nothing happens,

34:56.053 --> 34:59.216
except every alarm in the lab
goes offtime and again.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.012
You okay?

35:03.227 --> 35:06.765
Yes. This wasjust
really good wine.

35:06.855 --> 35:10.268
Right. Okay. So, the killer
still has the body,
so he tosses it offthe cliff.

35:10.359 --> 35:12.941
What was Alex Newcomb
doing back atjunglejim’s
that night?

35:13.028 --> 35:15.986
[Groans]
Bones here already
figured that one out.

35:16.073 --> 35:18.064
I did? How?

35:18.158 --> 35:21.195
Alex was there for his brother,
trying to save Chet’sjob.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.198
You got that one right.

35:28.168 --> 35:31.410
I’ve got dipsticks, pry bars,
ceremonial weapons,

35:31.505 --> 35:34.588
but the defect in the sternum
is too small to make a definitive match.

35:34.675 --> 35:37.963
The stab perforated the spine.
What about injury to the vertebrae?

35:38.053 --> 35:41.966
According to my calculations,
reversing the trajectory
ofthe nick in the sternum,

35:42.057 --> 35:44.309
Alex was stabbed
between the seventh
and the eighth ven‘ebrae.

35:44.393 --> 35:46.429
But we won’t get anything
from those vertebrae.

35:46.520 --> 35:51.105
They were alreadyjelly
when the X-rays were taken.
I hate this case.

35:51.191 --> 35:54.354
[Sighs] Did you know
that the earliest
production ofwine...

35:54.445 --> 35:57.403
took place in 6000 BC.
in what is now Iran?

35:57.489 --> 36:03.234
From grapes.
Rice was used in China
in 7000 BC.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.944
Is there anything
you don’t know?

36:05.039 --> 36:06.950
Yes. The murder weapon.

36:07.041 --> 36:09.828
Dr. Brennan is very adamant
that without a murder weapon,

36:09.918 --> 36:12.375
it’s much more difficult
to prosecute a homicide.

36:12.463 --> 36:15.500
- We have to find a way
to unseal this body.
- No, no— Whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:15.591 --> 36:17.832
Dr. Saroyan, I— Okay.
I’d just like to point out...

36:17.926 --> 36:19.837
that this could very much
resemble...

36:19.928 --> 36:22.510
what happens when one strikes
an egg with a Sledgehammer.

36:22.598 --> 36:25.010
Can you see another choice?

36:25.100 --> 36:28.467
Could we at least don
some rain gear first?

36:28.562 --> 36:31.520
[Angela]
Maybe I could help?

36:31.607 --> 36:33.689
Why is it that nobody
ever says to me,

36:33.776 --> 36:36.188
“Gee, Angela,
this looks impossible,

36:36.278 --> 36:39.065
but maybe you’re
the person who could
solve the problem”?

36:43.619 --> 36:48.409
Cam says you might be able
to do a virtual examination
ofthe body.

36:48.499 --> 36:50.410
I’ve been working
on a new program...

36:50.501 --> 36:53.664
that uses configuration-bias
Monte Carlo method.

36:53.754 --> 36:56.370
Here are the bones
currently left in the body.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.421
Now, there’s not much left,
but by factoring in...

36:58.509 --> 37:02.047
rate of decomposition
and bone destruction
from the hydrofluoric acid,

37:02.137 --> 37:05.675
I can attempt to virtually
regrow the bone.

37:07.101 --> 37:10.059
I have been to 74
interrogations with Booth.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.137
Forty-two in the room
and 32 observing.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.848
- Uh-huh.
- I should be able to do it.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.808
What? Interrogate?

37:17.903 --> 37:21.942
Yes. I even engaged in a very interesting
session with Sweets...

37:22.032 --> 37:24.739
to improve my ability
to manipulate people.

37:24.827 --> 37:27.239
Oh.
[Chuckles]

37:27.329 --> 37:29.285
- That wouldn’t work.
- Why not?

37:29.373 --> 37:32.661
Because... what Booth has,

37:32.751 --> 37:35.618
you can’t learn
from baby-boy shrink.

37:35.712 --> 37:40.797
Booth ’5 brilliant at
pretending to be stupider than
he actually is most of the time.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.920
Brilliant at stupidity?

37:43.011 --> 37:46.094
Mm-hmm.
EspeCIa/ly around you.

37:46.181 --> 37:50.094
Okay Here is what
Alex Ne wcomb ’s skeleton
looked like 72 hours ago.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.267
Why would Booth do that?
[Beeping]

37:52.354 --> 37:57.394
Well, he knows that you
like to be the smart one,
so he lets you have that.

37:59.111 --> 38:03.354
All right. Here’s what
Alex’s bones looked like
at the time of his death.

38:05.451 --> 38:09.239
Huh.jagged crenellations
between the seventh
and eighth vertebrae...

38:09.329 --> 38:11.661
indicate the path
ofthe murder weapon.

38:11.748 --> 38:15.411
Combining trajectory analysis
with force and thrust ratio.

38:15.502 --> 38:18.460
This suggests a square-edged
blade with an overlying step...

38:18.547 --> 38:21.254
that was at least
76 centimeters long.

38:21.341 --> 38:24.378
You know
I am smarter than Booth.

38:24.470 --> 38:27.837
Okay. So maybe
you should just let him...

38:27.931 --> 38:31.423
have the people skills
part ofthejob to himselfthen.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.889
Can you zoom in there?

38:34.980 --> 38:37.687
Yeah.
Okay. Look at this.

38:37.774 --> 38:42.143
It’s a curved notch,
maybe from a small pin?

38:42.237 --> 38:43.693
Yeah. Or a screw.

38:44.698 --> 38:46.905
Screw.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.199
Two blades held together
by a screw.

38:50.496 --> 38:52.828
Scissors.
[Chuckles]

38:52.915 --> 38:55.122
You are amazing, Angela.

38:55.209 --> 38:57.700
Eh. Ijust program
the computer.

38:57.794 --> 39:01.207
You’re the whiz-master
who makes the calls.
You’re welcome.

39:01.298 --> 39:03.209
Hey, sweetie?

39:03.300 --> 39:07.634
I think you’ll find
that the murder weapon
was a pair of tailor shears.

39:07.721 --> 39:08.961
Why?

39:09.056 --> 39:11.012
Why don’t you run this
information by Booth...

39:11.099 --> 39:13.932
and see how quickly he comes
to the same conclusion.

39:18.899 --> 39:21.857
Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan,
how you doing?

39:21.944 --> 39:23.935
[ I/anessa ]
Ha ve you made an y progress
on the case?

39:24.071 --> 39:26.528
Yeah. Here you go.
What’s this?

39:26.615 --> 39:29.106
That’s a warrant to seize
all your scissors and sewing shears.

39:29.201 --> 39:33.114
- Why?
- Newcomb, how long does it take
to swallow a couple of pills?

39:33.205 --> 39:36.163
We got customers on the ﬂoor.
Now get your hat on.

39:36.250 --> 39:38.662
- What’s going on?
- Uh, get back inside, Chet.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.376
What’s happening?
Just go back inside.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.454
Don’t lose yourjob.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.552
Booth?

39:54.643 --> 39:56.725
Oh, look at that.
You see, our lab discovered...

39:56.812 --> 40:00.100
that the murder weapon
was a pair of tailor shears.

40:00.190 --> 40:03.023
And Booth immediately
remembered that you’re a seamstress.

40:03.110 --> 40:05.647
We’re pretty sure we’re gonna find
Alex Newcomb’s blood on those.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.610
Alex caught me with someone.

40:11.702 --> 40:13.988
- Wh— Sexually, you mean?
- Who?

40:15.163 --> 40:18.371
-JungleJim?
- Whoa! How’d you get there?

40:18.458 --> 40:20.414
That’s how your sick husband
kept hisjob.

40:20.502 --> 40:24.370
First his brother
tried to help, then you.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.455
It wasjust one time.

40:26.550 --> 40:29.087
/ told jungle jim
/ ’d have sex with him just once...

40:29.177 --> 40:31.088
if he wouldn’t fire Chet.

40:31.179 --> 40:35.013
And— My luck—
Alex walked in looking
to get hisjob back and—

40:35.100 --> 40:39.264
Alex wouldn’t listen to me.
He said he was gonna
tell Chet, and /—

40:39.354 --> 40:42.812
- I couldn’t let that happen, so—
- So you killed him?

40:45.193 --> 40:47.024
Look, I love my husband.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.818
Yeah. So did his brother.

Okay, let me have that.
Okay? All right.
[ Si ghs ]

41:08.175 --> 41:10.257
Bones, you ready?

41:10.344 --> 41:13.051
You haven’t said anything
about my interrogation.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.050
Okay, you know what?

41:18.018 --> 41:21.431
You did great.
Okay? Better than I thought.

41:21.521 --> 41:24.228
I was terrible.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.853
Everybody’s right.
I lack empathy.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.271
You got empathy.
[ Scoffs ]

41:29.363 --> 41:32.400
You’re awkward.
That’s different.

41:33.700 --> 41:36.567
My stuff is bones.
Yours is people.

41:37.621 --> 41:39.077
Right.

41:39.164 --> 41:43.703
So, you’re admitting that
I’m better at something than you are?

41:43.794 --> 41:44.874
No—

41:49.383 --> 41:51.795
Yes.

41:51.885 --> 41:54.092
A lot better.

41:55.263 --> 41:56.594
Thanks, Bones.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.469
Hey, can we go now?

42:00.602 --> 42:03.810
Yes.
Yes. Wait till you see
what’s outside.

Right? Huh?
Buddy let me borro w it

42:10.779 --> 42:14.488
Can I drive it?
No, no, no. Wait a second.
This is a very powerful machine.

42:14.574 --> 42:16.735
Well, I can handle it.

Okay, look.
Once around the block.
[Alarm C hirps ]

42:20.664 --> 42:23.406
Uh, maybe.

42:23.500 --> 42:26.913
Okay— Okay! Driving a machine
like this is like making love.
You have to go gently.

I go more for passionate
and uninhibited
ratherthan gentle.

not a mechanic.

Drive it gently. But no.
You don’t listen to me.
