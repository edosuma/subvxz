WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:03.794
A warm summer afternoon.

00:03.795 --> 00:06.197
Matters start innocently enough:

00:06.198 --> 00:08.132
a shortcut home through a wooded park.

00:08.132 --> 00:11.168
What could possibly go wrong?

00:11.169 --> 00:14.338
Unfortunately,
for this young woman, Hortense,

00:14.339 --> 00:17.141
danger lurks nearby.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.544
Though her eyes and ears
tell her she's safe,

00:20.545 --> 00:25.182
some strange sixth sense tells
her something very different.

00:25.183 --> 00:29.453
Hortense is suddenly aware
of the predicament she is in.

00:29.454 --> 00:31.656
As danger closes in,

00:31.657 --> 00:34.792
Hortense rues her decision
to choose fashion

00:34.793 --> 00:37.228
over sensible footwear.

00:37.229 --> 00:39.430
All seems lost!

00:42.601 --> 00:45.703
Until the cavalry arrives.

00:45.704 --> 00:47.938
While the perpetrator was arrested,

00:47.939 --> 00:50.875
I would have been remiss
not to issue Hortense

00:50.876 --> 00:54.979
a warning for being
in the woods unaccompanied.

00:54.980 --> 00:58.316
And though some feel these
statutes need modernization,

00:58.317 --> 01:01.819
I remind our audience
listening at home:

01:01.820 --> 01:04.822
this is the law.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.094
Tune in next week at the same time

01:10.095 --> 01:11.762
for another case from the files

01:11.763 --> 01:13.731
of Mary Shaw, morality officer.

01:13.732 --> 01:16.367
Now, stay tuned to this station

01:16.368 --> 01:18.736
for Fiddling Father Gilmore
and another bible study

01:18.737 --> 01:20.204
from the Book of Kings.

01:23.241 --> 01:25.843
You know? Mary is getting good.

01:25.844 --> 01:28.512
- Mm.
- Isn't she? So proud of her.

01:28.513 --> 01:30.047
I bet you were able
to give her some tips.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.183
You know, all I did
was just tell her to relax

01:32.184 --> 01:33.751
and have fun with it.

01:33.752 --> 01:35.553
Oh! Speaking of fun: Bill!

01:35.554 --> 01:36.921
Fun's my favourite word.

01:36.922 --> 01:39.557
I was hoping that we could see
a picture at that new theatre

01:39.558 --> 01:41.225
on the Danforth, the Allan?

01:41.226 --> 01:42.727
I... I would love to,

01:42.728 --> 01:44.628
but... but not tonight.
I gotta be somewhere.

01:44.629 --> 01:46.564
Must be important.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.899
How about Saturday?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.434
Would that be all right?

01:52.304 --> 01:54.171
Sure. It's a date.

01:55.006 --> 01:56.374
I better get back to work.

02:02.714 --> 02:05.349
Mary, Mary:
You were great. You were great!

02:05.350 --> 02:07.051
Oh, well!

02:07.052 --> 02:09.286
I mean, I don't really like
being the centre of attention.

02:09.287 --> 02:12.289
You know, the police department,
they really foisted this on me.

02:12.290 --> 02:14.759
"Mary will bolster our image

02:14.760 --> 02:16.494
in the eyes of the public."

02:16.495 --> 02:17.762
I'm sure they meant ears,

02:17.763 --> 02:19.096
but I wasn't going to correct them.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.464
Well, you're a natural.

02:20.465 --> 02:22.633
Better than most of the damp
rags we have around here.

02:22.634 --> 02:25.503
Oh! I don't know about that.

02:25.504 --> 02:26.971
You have a real gift, you do.

02:31.042 --> 02:32.643
Well, I better go, you know?

02:32.644 --> 02:35.479
Hemlines to measure
and parks to patrol.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.681
A morality officer's work
is never done.

02:37.682 --> 02:40.251
Well... I will see you soon, Mary.

02:40.252 --> 02:41.986
Very soon. I hope.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.854
But- but not too soon because...

02:43.855 --> 02:46.724
because that would be
unscheduled and unexpected,

02:46.725 --> 02:48.993
so... I should go.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.428
OK.

02:50.429 --> 02:51.762
Oh, OK.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074

03:04.876 --> 03:06.110
Velma! What are you doing here?

03:06.111 --> 03:07.778
I need to talk with you, Trudy.

03:07.779 --> 03:09.180
Something wrong?

03:09.181 --> 03:10.948
It's about my brother, Bill.

03:10.949 --> 03:12.483
You remember him?

03:13.718 --> 03:15.820
Yes, I know Bill.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.322
Well, lately he's taken to staying out

03:18.323 --> 03:19.990
until all hours of the night.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.492
You don't say.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.794
And worse yet: he comes home
smelling of perfume.

03:23.795 --> 03:25.029
- Perfume?!
- I know!

03:25.030 --> 03:27.031
What churchgoing woman would
be caught wearing perfume?

03:27.032 --> 03:29.500
- Not me. You?
- Never.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.002
I think he's seeing a Jezebel.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.338
I want you to investigate
so I can put a stop to it

03:34.339 --> 03:35.606
before it goes too far.

03:37.209 --> 03:39.743
And I thought
maybe a nice girl like you...

03:39.744 --> 03:42.146
but a tramp? Doesn't that
just take the cake?

03:42.147 --> 03:43.881
Doesn't it...

03:49.054 --> 03:50.921
That article is a crock.

03:50.922 --> 03:53.557
Well, the police
and the bank seem convinced

03:53.558 --> 03:56.494
that your husband ran off
with $7500, Mrs. Pike.

03:56.495 --> 03:59.497
Maybe David might've stolen the money.

03:59.498 --> 04:01.265
But run out on me?

04:01.266 --> 04:03.200
No way. Never.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.368
What makes you so sure?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.370
Because I never
gave him any reason to.

04:07.439 --> 04:09.306
He had it good with me, honey.

04:09.307 --> 04:10.507
Too good.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.345
Why don't you tell us a little
bit more about what happened?

04:14.346 --> 04:16.647
He was a courier for the bank.

04:16.648 --> 04:19.716
He was supposed to deliver
$7500 to some company.

04:19.718 --> 04:23.987
He picked up the money,
then poof. Disappeared.

04:25.123 --> 04:27.658
It's been 10 days.
I want you to find him.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.127
Well, how do you know
he didn't just run off

04:30.128 --> 04:31.362
- with the cash?
- He wouldn't cheat me

04:31.363 --> 04:34.064
- like that.
- Ah, cheat- cheat you?

04:34.065 --> 04:35.432
From my share of the dough.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.869
Anything that's his is mine, right?

04:38.870 --> 04:40.604
Isn't that how a good marriage works?

04:40.605 --> 04:43.607
I'll tell you what: we'll find him

04:43.608 --> 04:45.175
and you can ask him yourself.

04:51.827 --> 04:56.887

05:01.826 --> 05:03.994
So, what do you think
about Ida? She's interesting.

05:03.995 --> 05:05.996
Maybe she's just after
her share of the money...

05:05.997 --> 05:08.399
Nah. I think she's
truly worried about him.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.401
All that talk about Pike having
it too good to run out on her?

05:12.771 --> 05:14.538
- Miss Drake.
- Mr. McLaughlin.

05:14.539 --> 05:16.440
What can you tell us about David Pike?

05:16.441 --> 05:19.543
I assure you, this is a matter
best left to the police.

05:19.544 --> 05:21.745
There's absolutely no need
for detectives.

05:21.746 --> 05:23.614
Especially female ones.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.816
Even if these female detectives find

05:25.817 --> 05:27.851
- your missing money?
- I've worked so hard

05:27.852 --> 05:30.020
to make this the safest
bank in the city.

05:30.021 --> 05:32.890
We installed a state-of-the-art
time-lock system on the vault.

05:32.891 --> 05:34.758
Even though the bank
is just around the corner

05:34.759 --> 05:37.528
- from the police station?
- Well, it's a great comfort

05:37.529 --> 05:40.864
to my customers. They know that
every dollar that they deposit

05:40.865 --> 05:42.433
is safe and accounted for.

05:42.434 --> 05:44.101
Minus the 7500

05:44.102 --> 05:45.836
that David Pike took off with.

05:45.837 --> 05:48.472
Did you ever notice
anything suspicious about him?

05:48.473 --> 05:50.307
He worked for me
for a couple of years.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.810
Steady. Dependable. I trusted him.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.378
Nothing unusual happened?

05:54.379 --> 05:57.047
Excuse me! I couldn't
help but overhear

05:57.048 --> 05:58.782
and well, uh...
a couple of weeks back,

05:58.783 --> 06:00.050
there was that business

06:00.051 --> 06:01.318
with your desk drawer, Mr. McLaughlin.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.520
If I need your input,
Miss Parsons, I will ask for it.

06:03.521 --> 06:05.623
Please, we'd like
to hear more about it.

06:05.624 --> 06:07.491
It was nothing.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.294
A few weeks ago,
I found my desk drawer open.

06:10.295 --> 06:12.429
- And that was unusual?
- Oh, yes.

06:12.430 --> 06:14.865
Mr. McLaughlin is extremely
particular about his office.

06:14.866 --> 06:16.667
Really, that is quite
enough help, Miss Parsons.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.470
I'd like to look
at this drawer, if possible.

06:19.471 --> 06:20.838
Fine.

06:29.648 --> 06:31.715
As I said, it was nothing.

06:31.716 --> 06:33.617
I mustn't have fully
closed it when I left.

06:33.618 --> 06:34.852
Yet you made a big enough fuss

06:34.853 --> 06:36.754
that it stuck in your
secretary's mind.

06:36.755 --> 06:38.555
This job is stressful at times;

06:38.556 --> 06:40.958
sometimes my patience is tested.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.394
What did you find?

06:43.395 --> 06:46.797
I don't know. They look like
tiny slivers of wood, or plant.

06:47.599 --> 06:49.500
Any idea how it got there?

06:49.501 --> 06:50.734
None.

06:55.073 --> 06:56.513
I'll catch up with you later.

07:01.813 --> 07:03.580
You seem to know what's
really going on around here.

07:03.581 --> 07:05.315
And you're not afraid
to speak up about it.

07:05.316 --> 07:07.017
Anything else you want to tell me?

07:07.018 --> 07:09.687
I've gotten into enough trouble today.

07:09.688 --> 07:12.022
Your boss will never know. I promise.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.591
I don't want to speak ill of anyone,

07:14.592 --> 07:16.860
but Mr. Pike is a bit of a Lothario.

07:18.129 --> 07:20.431
- Even though he was married?
- Since when does a ring stop

07:20.432 --> 07:21.732
a man like that from being...

07:21.733 --> 07:23.867
...a man like that? Never.

07:23.868 --> 07:26.103
He's tried to seduce
all the gals who work here.

07:26.104 --> 07:29.172
- And you?
- He tried, but I didn't bite.

07:30.308 --> 07:32.876
- You know anyone who did?
- All I heard were rumours

07:32.877 --> 07:34.144
about this girl or that.

07:34.145 --> 07:36.847
All I know for sure is he must
have been very successful

07:36.848 --> 07:38.982
- in his conquests.
- What makes you say that?

07:38.983 --> 07:41.785
They say he keeps a love nest
down in the Don Valley.

07:41.786 --> 07:44.555
In case there's need
for a clandestine rendezvous.

07:44.556 --> 07:46.323
Do you know where it is?

07:47.392 --> 07:49.760
Like I said: I never fell
for the sweet talk.

08:00.371 --> 08:02.372
- What do you mean she quit?
- Well, she just doesn't want

08:02.373 --> 08:04.341
to do the part. She said
she's an artist and an artist

08:04.342 --> 08:05.609
shouldn't be treated like she was.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.212
Artist? Then she should be
painting because she sure

08:08.213 --> 08:09.880
couldn't act! What am I
supposed to do now?

08:09.881 --> 08:11.749
What am I supposed to do?

08:11.750 --> 08:13.317
- I don't know.
- We are two days out

08:13.318 --> 08:15.486
on this show. Find me another actress.

08:15.487 --> 08:17.587
- Of course.
- Find me one!

08:18.456 --> 08:19.656
Madam.

08:24.662 --> 08:26.430
- Hi.
- I- I brought you

08:26.431 --> 08:28.866
next week's script. But if-
if now is a bad time...

08:28.867 --> 08:31.902
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Of course not. It- course not.

08:31.903 --> 08:34.871
- Who was that man?
- Ah, that was Daniel Rockwell,

08:34.873 --> 08:37.707
station owner and manager
and maintenance man,

08:37.708 --> 08:38.842
pretty much everything else
you can think of.

08:38.842 --> 08:40.844
Oh. Well, he wasn't
being very pleasant.

08:40.845 --> 08:42.479
Ah, he's- he's all right.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.648
Radio is brand new and...

08:44.649 --> 08:47.117
these stations are one calamity
away from bankruptcy.

08:47.118 --> 08:49.686
Where do you think you're
gonna find another actress?

08:53.324 --> 08:54.725
I think I already have.

08:56.594 --> 08:59.396
- Come on!
- Huey, narrating a weekly

08:59.397 --> 09:02.032
morality play is one thing,
but I'm no Lillian Gish.

09:02.033 --> 09:04.034
Oh! The part is a reporter,
similar to what been doing

09:04.035 --> 09:06.069
on your show. You'd be reading
off of a prepared script.

09:06.070 --> 09:07.304
Oh. But I wouldn't be any good.

09:07.305 --> 09:08.972
I think you'd be great.

09:10.942 --> 09:12.209
I think you'd be great.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.978
Say you'll do it. Oh, please, Mary!

09:14.979 --> 09:17.099
Come on! You'd be helping me
out of a tight spot.

09:17.448 --> 09:20.184
- All right! I'll do it for you.
- Aw, that's swell. Thank you.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.818
- Thank you.
- Yeah. No problem.

09:24.455 --> 09:26.390
A shack in the woods?

09:27.625 --> 09:29.893
Well, I suppose there's
this hunt camp he rents

09:29.894 --> 09:31.561
sometimes during deer season.

09:32.664 --> 09:34.231
Have you been to this hunt camp

09:34.232 --> 09:36.066
- since your husband disappeared?
- Oh, it didn't even occur

09:36.067 --> 09:39.403
to me. Do you think he might be there?

09:40.772 --> 09:42.806
- Could be.
- How do you even know

09:42.807 --> 09:45.876
- about this place?
- Sometimes these investigations

09:45.877 --> 09:48.946
- turn up secrets.
- And you've turned up a secret

09:48.947 --> 09:51.915
- about David?
- Well, we think he used

09:51.916 --> 09:54.017
this hunt camp to bring young women.

09:54.018 --> 09:55.919
And not for hunting.

09:57.288 --> 09:59.890
- I'm so sorry.
- That David likes to have

09:59.891 --> 10:01.391
some extra-curricular fun?

10:03.328 --> 10:05.696
- I know all about it.
- You do?

10:05.697 --> 10:08.232
Oh. Do you want me to have
a good cry, or something?

10:09.834 --> 10:14.738
Look, both my husband and I
have healthy appetites,

10:14.739 --> 10:16.039
if you get my meaning.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.374
Healthy?

10:17.375 --> 10:20.744
Like screen doors
banging in a hurricane.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.646
Oh.

10:22.647 --> 10:25.315
Can you tell us
where to find this hunt camp?

10:25.316 --> 10:26.984
Thinking of shooting some deer?

10:26.985 --> 10:29.519
I'm thinking about
finding your husband.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.858
You know, I bet David stole
the money and holed up

10:34.859 --> 10:36.994
at this "love nest"
with one of his liaisons.

10:36.995 --> 10:39.129
Well, just because he and
the missus have an arrangement

10:39.130 --> 10:40.564
doesn't mean the heart didn't wander.

10:40.565 --> 10:42.199
Ida probably misread
the whole situation. I mean,

10:42.200 --> 10:44.401
sometimes a woman thinks they
have the situation figured out

10:44.402 --> 10:46.470
- and it turns out they don't!
- Everything OK?

10:46.471 --> 10:48.572
- I'm fine. Everything's fine.
- You're lying.

10:48.573 --> 10:50.107
- I'm not.
- You're still lying.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.408
- How do you know?
- 'Cause you have this little...

10:51.409 --> 10:53.877
twitch on the top of
your mouth. It's your tell.

10:53.878 --> 10:56.346
Sometimes it's hard having
a detective for a best friend.

10:56.347 --> 10:59.149
- You want to talk about it?
- I'll keep that in mind.

11:02.086 --> 11:05.289
- Oh.
- Ah! You're the new actress.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.925
- Ah, yes. Mary Shaw.
- Mm-hm. I've heard your show.

11:07.926 --> 11:10.260
Beggars can't be choosers,
I suppose. Any questions?

11:10.261 --> 11:12.296
Ah, well, I haven't
had a chance to read

11:12.297 --> 11:14.431
- the entire script yet.
- But you get the gist?

11:14.432 --> 11:16.199
- Yes. I'm a reporter.
- Check.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.535
And I seem to be covering
some sort of showdown between

11:18.536 --> 11:20.704
- police officers and criminals.
- Yep.

11:20.705 --> 11:23.941
Right. But when I get to this
one part in the script, um...

11:23.942 --> 11:25.909
there seems to be
a bunch of scenes missing.

11:25.910 --> 11:27.844
Well, when we get live to air,
I don't want it

11:27.845 --> 11:30.447
to feel rehearsed.
I want the audience surprised,

11:30.448 --> 11:31.982
so you, the actor,
needs to be surprised.

11:31.983 --> 11:35.953
OK... but how am I supposed
to understand my character

11:35.954 --> 11:37.454
if I haven't read the full script?

11:37.455 --> 11:39.489
You're not going to get
all artsy on me, are you?

11:39.490 --> 11:42.326
- Right, Huey?
- Ah, no. Of course not.

11:42.327 --> 11:45.128
Trust me on this! We're going
to make broadcasting history.

11:45.129 --> 11:47.864
- We are?
- Oh, everyone knows the future

11:47.865 --> 11:49.666
is radio, but no one knows
how to make a buck off it.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.535
And let me tell you:
running a station ain't cheap.

11:51.536 --> 11:54.871
- I expect not.
- The answer is paid advertising

11:54.872 --> 11:56.606
and for that I need a big audience.

11:56.607 --> 11:58.308
I won't get one
with fiddle playing priests

11:58.309 --> 11:59.977
- and a bunch of what-nots!
- No, no.

11:59.978 --> 12:03.947
- Definitely not "what-nots."
- Live drama. Radio plays.

12:03.948 --> 12:06.149
They will change the business forever.

12:06.150 --> 12:08.852
So, do you want to be
part of history or not?

12:08.853 --> 12:11.088
Well, who wants to be a part
of history when you can be

12:11.089 --> 12:13.590
a part of the future?
Count me in, Mr. Rockwell.

12:13.591 --> 12:16.426
Huh! That's my girl.

12:32.910 --> 12:34.411
David Pike?

12:41.419 --> 12:45.222
Ugh. Not my first choice
for a romantic romp.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.591
- Me neither.
- Well, he's not here.

12:47.592 --> 12:50.827
- So, where is he?
- That's a very good question.

12:51.996 --> 12:54.031
But, then, I got a lot of
questions, like when did he

12:54.032 --> 12:56.800
graduate from romancing
one dame to romancing two

12:56.801 --> 12:58.568
at the same time? What's his secret?

12:58.569 --> 13:00.037
We're not here for romance.

13:00.038 --> 13:02.539
Well you sure as hell didn't
come here to shoot deer, either.

13:02.540 --> 13:04.307
What do you want with Pike?

13:04.308 --> 13:06.977
- We want to talk to him.
- Well, when you find him,

13:06.978 --> 13:08.745
tell him that Tom Knight
also wants a word.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.148
- And what should I say?
- That he owes me rent.

13:11.149 --> 13:13.550
- A lot of it.
- You own this shack?

13:13.551 --> 13:16.386
Yeah. Which you two
are trespassing on,

13:16.387 --> 13:19.656
- so it's time for you to go.
- No need to get testy.

13:19.657 --> 13:21.291
Just a couple of private detectives

13:21.292 --> 13:24.394
- trying to track him down.
- Maybe you could help us?

13:24.395 --> 13:27.464
- Why should I help you?
- Because when we find him,

13:27.465 --> 13:29.145
we'll make sure that he
pays you your rent.

13:30.968 --> 13:32.102
What do you want to know?

13:32.103 --> 13:33.904
When was the last time you saw him?

13:33.905 --> 13:36.239
A month ago. Maybe longer.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.141
Did he mention anything
about running away?

13:38.142 --> 13:40.444
- Maybe with a girlfriend?
- No.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.079
Did he say anything to you at all?

13:42.080 --> 13:44.314
No. Look, all I know

13:44.315 --> 13:46.683
about the guy is
that I don't like him.

13:46.684 --> 13:48.652
I just want to get
the rent he owes me.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.754
We'll be sure to pass that along.

13:56.094 --> 13:57.961
Maybe David took the money
and hit the road

13:57.962 --> 13:59.463
with one of his conquests.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.698
Maybe a jealous husband got involved.

14:03.701 --> 14:05.102
- What's up?
- Take a look at this.

14:05.103 --> 14:07.270
Well, it's a green fly,

14:07.271 --> 14:09.406
and... they usually feed on carrion.

14:09.407 --> 14:11.041
There's something dead around here.

14:11.042 --> 14:13.109
Well, we are in the woods.

14:14.579 --> 14:15.945
Let's look around.

14:19.016 --> 14:20.483
Frankie!

14:23.121 --> 14:25.455
Who do you suppose
that shoe belongs to?

14:40.280 --> 14:42.781
So, he didn't run out on me.

14:43.868 --> 14:45.535
At least I was right about that.

14:46.638 --> 14:48.271
Yes, you were.

14:49.073 --> 14:50.474
David wasn't perfect,

14:50.475 --> 14:52.509
but he made me happy.

14:54.712 --> 14:56.446
I really loved that man.

14:58.950 --> 15:00.684
We are so sorry.

15:01.719 --> 15:03.487
You know what the funny thing is?

15:05.056 --> 15:07.491
This is the safest job he's ever had.

15:08.059 --> 15:09.326
What do you mean?

15:09.327 --> 15:12.429
Well, he used to work
as a guard down at the Don Jail.

15:12.430 --> 15:15.065
I was always worried about him.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.069
When he got this job at the bank
two years ago, I was...

15:19.070 --> 15:20.971
I was relieved.

15:23.708 --> 15:25.909
Don't that just take the cake?

15:29.180 --> 15:30.514
So, what happens now?

15:30.515 --> 15:33.083
We find out who killed your husband.

15:34.352 --> 15:36.153
Cause of death
was a single gunshot wound

15:36.154 --> 15:37.688
to the chest fired at close range.

15:37.689 --> 15:39.756
So the killer knew him
well enough to get close.

15:39.757 --> 15:41.458
- Hm.
- Do we have a time of death?

15:41.459 --> 15:43.159
Two days ago.

15:44.228 --> 15:46.229
So, what was Pike doing
in the eight days

15:46.230 --> 15:48.699
between the time he disappeared
and when he was killed?

15:48.700 --> 15:50.434
And what happened to the money?

15:50.435 --> 15:52.869
Maybe someone knew he'd stolen
it and killed him for it.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.538
- A friend?
- A partner?

15:54.539 --> 15:56.406
I mean, why split the loot
when you can have it all?

15:56.407 --> 15:57.741
- Exactly.
- Are these

15:57.742 --> 15:59.743
- his personal effects?
- Yeah. He wasn't

15:59.744 --> 16:02.713
- the snappiest dresser.
- It's damp, but...

16:02.714 --> 16:04.514
Oh! That's a smell.

16:04.515 --> 16:06.635
Yeah. I haven't had
a chance to examine it yet.

16:08.453 --> 16:11.088
They smell like... sour tea.

16:11.089 --> 16:13.323
Right! What could give it that smell?

16:13.324 --> 16:15.192
I could do a chemical analysis on it.

16:15.193 --> 16:17.694
You think you can get out
enough liquid to run the test?

16:17.695 --> 16:19.796
You've never seen me
wring out my stockings.

16:20.732 --> 16:22.733
- OK.
- Hm.

16:27.905 --> 16:31.174
"From my vantage point,
I can see several figures

16:31.175 --> 16:33.410
- inside the building."
- Who are they?

16:33.411 --> 16:36.413
Oh! Ah... those are the hostages.

16:36.414 --> 16:37.681
What is this building?

16:37.682 --> 16:41.852
Ah... ah... the script doesn't say.

16:41.853 --> 16:45.789
Anyway... "Wait! I can hear
a rhythmic tapping.

16:45.790 --> 16:48.925
"Are they... yes, they are!

16:48.926 --> 16:51.862
They're trying to send a message
via Morse code!"

16:51.863 --> 16:55.632
Mary, come on! The hostages
just happen to know Morse code?

16:55.633 --> 16:57.434
Well, lots of people know it.

16:59.303 --> 17:01.738
- Yes, I do, too, but that...
- Could we please just

17:01.739 --> 17:03.306
- finish the story?
- Mm-hmm.

17:04.474 --> 17:07.310
"Alerted by the hostages,
the police are now loading

17:07.310 --> 17:09.945
"their pistols and getting ready
to storm in.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.249
What will happen next?"

17:12.250 --> 17:14.384
Wha... what does happen next?

17:14.385 --> 17:15.585
The script ends there.

17:15.586 --> 17:17.787
What? That just leaves us hanging.

17:18.756 --> 17:20.589
Do you think you'll
listen to the show?

17:20.590 --> 17:22.592
Of course! We wouldn't miss it.

17:22.593 --> 17:25.929
I really hope it goes well.
Mr. Rockwell's constantly

17:25.930 --> 17:28.298
rewriting the scenes.
He's even left entire pages

17:28.299 --> 17:30.400
- missing from the script.
- Just remember what I told you:

17:30.401 --> 17:31.901
relax and be yourself.

17:32.937 --> 17:35.439
But Mary, did you find out
anything about Tom Knight?

17:35.440 --> 17:36.640
Yes.

17:38.443 --> 17:40.277
Checked the files.
He has quite the record:

17:40.278 --> 17:43.747
several arrests for fraud,
theft and assault.

17:43.748 --> 17:45.882
He spent time in the Don Jail
two years ago.

17:45.883 --> 17:48.752
Oh? How 'bout that? David Pike
worked at the Don Jail

17:48.753 --> 17:50.821
- around the same time.
- Maybe that's where they met.

17:50.822 --> 17:52.989
- Anything else?
- Uh...

17:52.990 --> 17:54.758
Nothing that really stood out.

17:54.759 --> 17:57.594
But, if you'll excuse me,
I really should be going.

17:57.595 --> 18:00.163
Mr. Rockwell's going
to have my hide if I'm late.

18:00.164 --> 18:02.966
- Break a leg!
- That might be less painful.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.167
Bye!

18:05.503 --> 18:07.838
So, Pike was working at the bank

18:07.839 --> 18:10.040
when he and Knight
crossed paths again.

18:10.041 --> 18:12.409
Pike is looking for a place
to take his paramours,

18:12.410 --> 18:13.944
so Knight offers his shack.

18:13.945 --> 18:16.213
They got to talking
and came up with a plan

18:16.214 --> 18:18.448
- to steal the $7500.
- But then Knight

18:18.449 --> 18:20.750
double-crosses him
and takes the haul for himself.

18:21.719 --> 18:23.653
Seems to fit, but how do we prove it?

18:25.590 --> 18:28.492
- Nightcap?
- I'd love to, but I got plans.

18:28.493 --> 18:30.126
Big date with Bill?

18:30.127 --> 18:32.195
Something like that.

18:39.170 --> 18:40.170
There you go.

18:40.171 --> 18:42.639
Thank you.

18:42.640 --> 18:43.740
Thank you.

18:47.745 --> 18:49.746
- New pages for you, Mary.
- Oh.

18:49.747 --> 18:51.681
About the pay: it's a little
bit less than I told you,

18:51.682 --> 18:53.250
but things are tight
around here, so...

18:53.251 --> 18:55.452
That's fine. I mean about the money.

18:55.453 --> 18:58.889
But... ah, but Mr. Rockwell,
this script?

18:58.890 --> 19:00.924
I just finished learning these lines

19:00.925 --> 19:02.259
and now it's completely different.

19:02.260 --> 19:04.094
Mary, we've been through this.

19:07.498 --> 19:08.832
- Gun! Gun! That man has a gun!
- Easy, easy, easy!

19:08.833 --> 19:11.034
The man's a Foley artist.
The gun shoots blanks.

19:11.035 --> 19:13.436
When you read "gunshot"
in the script, he creates

19:13.437 --> 19:16.473
the sound effects.
Look, he's got sirens to wail,

19:16.474 --> 19:19.643
- doors to slam, everything.
- Right. Uh, Mr. Rockwell,

19:19.644 --> 19:22.279
I have to say I'm a bit
concerned with how violent

19:22.280 --> 19:23.580
this script is becoming.

19:24.515 --> 19:27.884
- Yes! But is it life-like?
- I don't know.

19:27.885 --> 19:31.054
The answer is, 'Yes it is.'
The audience will be riveted.

19:31.055 --> 19:34.124
It'll be a thrill ride no
listener has ever taken before.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.026
Now, look over your lines

19:36.027 --> 19:38.061
and get ready. Remember...

19:38.062 --> 19:39.296
we're going to make history.

19:39.297 --> 19:40.564
- Right.
- History.

19:40.565 --> 19:42.132
- History.
- Foley?

19:42.133 --> 19:43.567
- Right. History.
- Right. OK.

19:52.143 --> 19:53.910
- Drake.
- Greyson.

19:55.346 --> 19:57.881
- May I come in?
- Of course.

19:59.183 --> 20:00.617
Wow!

20:00.618 --> 20:03.620
These are some swell digs.

20:03.621 --> 20:05.555
There must be some real money

20:05.556 --> 20:07.290
in the private detective racket, huh?

20:07.291 --> 20:09.059
If you're good at your job.

20:09.060 --> 20:11.461
- Hm.
- How could I help you?

20:11.462 --> 20:14.464
You and I have something
in common. Or someone.

20:14.465 --> 20:16.132
David Pike.

20:17.301 --> 20:20.003
I'm investigating his murder.
I got a few questions for you.

20:20.004 --> 20:21.871
I know I told your men
everything I know.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.640
I gave them my statement
after I called it in.

20:23.641 --> 20:25.408
You wouldn't be holding
anything back, would you?

20:25.409 --> 20:27.477
I don't make it a habit
to lie to the police.

20:27.478 --> 20:29.179
No, it's more of a hobby, isn't it?

20:29.180 --> 20:31.481
Oh. That's cute.

20:31.482 --> 20:32.949
The minute I know something,
I'll let you know.

20:32.950 --> 20:34.184
- Really?
- As long as it doesn't

20:34.185 --> 20:35.819
jeopardize my client's safety.

20:35.820 --> 20:38.455
I'm not asking you to
jeopardize your client's safety.

20:38.456 --> 20:40.223
So what are you asking me?

20:41.025 --> 20:43.360
I'm asking you to trust me.
Just a bit.

20:43.361 --> 20:45.962
Enough for us to share
some information,

20:45.963 --> 20:48.298
help each other out. Quid pro quo.

20:50.301 --> 20:53.970
- Come on.
- Fine.

20:55.139 --> 20:58.241
We believe that Pike met
Tom Knight while working

20:58.242 --> 20:59.609
as a guard at the Don Jail.

20:59.610 --> 21:02.345
It's very possible that they
planned the burglary together

21:02.346 --> 21:05.048
and that Knight may have killed him.

21:05.850 --> 21:07.050
That's what you got?

21:08.285 --> 21:11.488
Nice try. That was step one for us.

21:11.489 --> 21:14.257
- Sure.
- I can see that you don't

21:14.258 --> 21:16.759
believe me, so I'm going to give
you something for free...

21:18.129 --> 21:20.030
...Tom Knight has an air-tight alibi

21:20.031 --> 21:21.598
for the day that Pike was killed.

21:22.566 --> 21:24.234
- Really?
- Really.

21:24.235 --> 21:26.870
Well, thanks for the update.

21:26.871 --> 21:29.105
You're welcome. Now...

21:30.041 --> 21:32.208
- ...want to tell me something?
- Sure.

21:32.209 --> 21:34.878
Thanks for stopping by.

21:36.213 --> 21:39.082
Yeah. I was talking
about the case, but...

21:39.083 --> 21:41.551
I will call you the minute
I have some quo.

21:41.552 --> 21:43.519
I am sure you will.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.890
That's a nice view.

21:53.764 --> 21:55.665
Mrs. Chakowitz.

21:55.666 --> 21:58.435
Dr. Thompson! I thought
you'd gone home already.

21:58.436 --> 22:00.737
I've been in my office
attempting to finish off

22:00.738 --> 22:03.673
all my paperwork, though I
barely even made a dent.

22:04.475 --> 22:05.842
No rest for the weary, I suppose.

22:05.843 --> 22:08.311
Very true, sir.
If death doesn't take a rest,

22:08.312 --> 22:10.447
neither should we.

22:10.448 --> 22:12.949
- Why are you still here?
- Oh! I'm doing some homework.

22:12.950 --> 22:15.585
I'm taking some night classes
at the university.

22:16.487 --> 22:17.754
This must be a new thing for you?

22:17.755 --> 22:19.689
It's been about 10 years, sir.

22:19.690 --> 22:21.424
I suppose I should have known that.

22:21.425 --> 22:23.560
Secretarial arts, I presume?

22:23.561 --> 22:26.429
- Medicine, actually.
- Oh! How very enterprising.

22:26.430 --> 22:30.300
Good luck with your homework.
Try not to spill anything.

22:42.379 --> 22:45.548
Oof! A few noodles, a little chicken,

22:45.549 --> 22:47.717
and yet, it's always so delicious.

22:47.718 --> 22:49.652
Wendy is a master.

22:49.653 --> 22:51.888
Mm. But I think

22:51.889 --> 22:53.456
the secret ingredient

22:53.457 --> 22:55.091
is the company.

22:55.092 --> 22:57.660
You're sweet.

22:58.729 --> 23:00.230
But I'm not much of a secret.

23:00.231 --> 23:01.431
More of an open book.

23:01.432 --> 23:03.399
That's one of the things
I like about you.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.202
Still... there's always
something more to learn

23:06.203 --> 23:07.504
about a person.

23:07.505 --> 23:09.339
So you do have secrets?

23:09.340 --> 23:12.875
Well... I never eat mushrooms.

23:13.778 --> 23:15.178
Okay. I can live with that.

23:15.179 --> 23:17.780
And I never wear perfume.

23:19.250 --> 23:21.151
Yeah. I noticed that.

23:21.152 --> 23:23.853
So, you prefer a woman
to wear perfume, do you?

23:25.356 --> 23:27.991
Not necessarily.

23:27.992 --> 23:30.126
That- that's up to you, Trudy.

23:30.928 --> 23:33.596
- Good to know.
- Anything else?

23:34.598 --> 23:35.865
Uh, I can't.

23:35.866 --> 23:37.433
I got something at church.

23:37.434 --> 23:40.003
I should be going. Thanks, Wendy.

23:40.004 --> 23:41.371
See you soon.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.475
All right, well... be seeing you.

23:45.476 --> 23:47.443
Well, we are seeing that picture

23:47.444 --> 23:48.845
at the Allen on Saturday?

23:49.713 --> 23:50.913
If you still want to.

23:57.154 --> 23:59.489
- Night.
- Night.

24:07.865 --> 24:09.199
Something at church?

24:09.200 --> 24:11.067
What could be happening at this hour?

24:47.571 --> 24:48.771
Big news, Frankie.

24:48.772 --> 24:50.473
I managed to extract enough water

24:50.474 --> 24:52.108
from Pike's clothing
to do an analysis.

24:52.109 --> 24:54.344
- And?
- It was full of tannic acid.

24:54.345 --> 24:56.613
Tannic acid? Isn't that what's
used to preserve leather?

24:56.614 --> 24:59.883
Yes, but in this case,
think of leather as body tissue.

24:59.884 --> 25:02.352
So, you're saying there
was enough tannic acid

25:02.353 --> 25:04.654
to preserve David Pike?

25:04.655 --> 25:06.322
He'd been swimming in it.

25:06.323 --> 25:08.057
Meaning the time
of death could be off.

25:08.058 --> 25:09.292
He could have died days earlier.

25:09.293 --> 25:11.027
Or he may have even
been killed the day

25:11.028 --> 25:13.796
- he and the money went missing.
- Tom Knight no longer

25:13.797 --> 25:16.766
has an alibi; this changes everything.

25:24.201 --> 25:25.941
Bet the water coming
out of that sluice

25:25.942 --> 25:27.876
is filled with tannic acid.

25:27.877 --> 25:30.245
The whole pond is
probably filled with it.

25:31.481 --> 25:34.750
Everyone around here would
know that, including Knight.

25:36.086 --> 25:37.419
Sure.

25:38.722 --> 25:40.923
Everyone knows what it does.

25:40.924 --> 25:44.660
So, Knight comes up with a plan

25:44.661 --> 25:47.429
to kill David and then
he throws him in the pond

25:47.430 --> 25:48.530
to let him pickle.

25:50.267 --> 25:52.601
But why go to all that trouble?

25:52.602 --> 25:55.671
Because he's worried someone
will make the prison connection,

25:55.672 --> 25:58.507
so he creates an ironclad alibi.

25:58.508 --> 26:01.743
Okay. How far do you think
the "love nest" is from here?

26:02.946 --> 26:05.781
Not sure how much love is
actually factored into the nest.

26:06.850 --> 26:08.617
Five-minute walk?

26:08.618 --> 26:10.819
Okay. Let's go see
what Knight has to say.

26:13.390 --> 26:15.457
You want to tell me about it?

26:15.458 --> 26:16.759
No...

26:16.760 --> 26:19.595
That's the kind of 'no'
that is closer to 'yes.'

26:19.596 --> 26:22.331
This has to do with Bill, doesn't it?

26:23.700 --> 26:26.001
- I followed him last night.
- You followed Bill?

26:26.002 --> 26:27.836
I had suspicions.

26:27.837 --> 26:30.739
That he wasn't paying
his taxes in a timely manner?

26:30.740 --> 26:32.875
No! That he was two-timing me.

26:32.876 --> 26:34.410
No.

26:34.411 --> 26:37.012
I saw Bill go into a strange
woman's house that night.

26:37.013 --> 26:38.447
OK, but that doesn't mean...

26:38.448 --> 26:40.115
I know what it means, Frankie.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.151
You want my advice?

26:43.987 --> 26:45.054
Go ahead.

26:45.055 --> 26:47.856
Talk to him. Make him come clean.

26:48.992 --> 26:50.125
And if he doesn't come clean,

26:50.126 --> 26:51.827
make sure he knows
you brought your gun.

26:51.828 --> 26:54.830
You know, that's one
of the things I like about you;

26:54.831 --> 26:56.565
you're very practical.

26:59.402 --> 27:00.502
I've already talked to the police.

27:00.503 --> 27:02.771
I don't need to talk to some lady PIs.

27:02.772 --> 27:04.406
Where were you 10 nights ago?

27:04.407 --> 27:05.941
- What does that matter?
- You didn't answer

27:05.942 --> 27:08.243
the question. Where were you
10 nights ago?

27:08.244 --> 27:10.112
I had a quiet night at home.

27:10.113 --> 27:12.281
- By yourself?
- That's right.

27:12.282 --> 27:15.150
So that means you don't have
an alibi for David's murder.

27:15.151 --> 27:17.419
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:17.420 --> 27:19.822
Using the tannic acid
in the water to alter the time

27:19.823 --> 27:21.223
of death? That was smart.

27:22.025 --> 27:23.625
I think you'd best be going.

27:23.626 --> 27:24.927
Is that a threat?

27:24.928 --> 27:27.896
Consider it sage advice.

27:34.037 --> 27:36.305
- No surprises there.
- It was worth a shot.

27:38.742 --> 27:40.275
What's this?

27:40.276 --> 27:42.578
Looks like a burr. We're in
the forest. They're everywhere.

27:42.579 --> 27:45.247
Yeah, but not around here.

27:46.049 --> 27:48.150
This looks incredibly familiar.

27:49.686 --> 27:51.166
We need to get back to the bank.

27:53.390 --> 27:55.491
So... Mary,

27:55.492 --> 27:57.459
only a couple hours 'til the show.

27:57.460 --> 27:58.660
How are you holding up?

27:59.996 --> 28:02.731
Well, not so good.
All of these last-minute changes

28:02.732 --> 28:05.167
- are a bit overwhelming.
- Look...

28:05.168 --> 28:07.636
Mr. Rockwell isn't
always easy to work for.

28:07.637 --> 28:10.806
But... he's put everything into this.

28:10.807 --> 28:13.509
You know, when the business
couldn't make payroll,

28:13.510 --> 28:14.977
he took out personal loans.

28:14.978 --> 28:16.779
I'm worried that
when people hear this,

28:16.780 --> 28:18.881
- they're going to be frightened.
- Oh, no, don't worry.

28:18.882 --> 28:20.682
They'll... there'll be
a disclaimer read

28:20.683 --> 28:23.318
before the program so everyone
will understand it isn't real.

28:24.220 --> 28:25.654
I don't know...

28:25.655 --> 28:28.290
Look, we can't turn
our back on him, Mary.

28:30.193 --> 28:32.094
Not after we've come this far.

28:33.563 --> 28:35.798
No, you're right. Of course.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.699
The show must go on.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.401
That's the spirit. Great.

28:43.206 --> 28:44.573
You know, Mary, uh...

28:44.574 --> 28:48.076
for what it's worth, I think
you're stealing the show.

28:54.717 --> 28:57.119
Mr. McLaughlin,
we'd like to have a word.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.620
Tell me you've found the stolen money.

28:58.621 --> 29:00.422
Well, for that you need
to be honest with us.

29:00.423 --> 29:01.523
Are you implying I haven't been?

29:01.524 --> 29:04.193
She's not implying.

29:04.194 --> 29:05.461
I have to close up for the weekend.

29:05.462 --> 29:06.895
You need to leave. Now.

29:06.896 --> 29:09.064
Those little pieces of wood
we found in your drawer?

29:09.065 --> 29:10.365
They're hooks from a burr.

29:10.366 --> 29:11.867
What has that got to do with anything?

29:11.868 --> 29:14.369
There are burr bushes near the
shack that David Pike rented.

29:14.370 --> 29:16.305
We believe they fell off
of him as he was searching

29:16.306 --> 29:18.207
through your drawer.
Now, my question is

29:18.208 --> 29:20.075
- what are you hiding?
- You saw for yourself

29:20.076 --> 29:21.643
when you searched it,
there was nothing of value.

29:21.644 --> 29:24.480
Well, maybe we need to speak
to the president of the bank.

29:24.481 --> 29:27.649
No. There's no need to involve him.

29:27.650 --> 29:30.852
You're right. All you have
to do is tell us the truth.

29:32.956 --> 29:34.223
Best if I just show you.

29:38.428 --> 29:40.629
When they put fancy locks
on bank vault doors,

29:40.630 --> 29:42.698
robbers threatened
to kill bank employees

29:42.699 --> 29:44.433
unless they gave up the combination.

29:44.434 --> 29:46.502
So they came up
with the time-locks to make sure

29:46.503 --> 29:48.770
that the vault couldn't be
opened before a specific time.

29:48.771 --> 29:50.973
Correct. There was no point
in a robber killing anyone

29:50.974 --> 29:53.442
because even if they coughed up
the combination,

29:53.443 --> 29:55.744
- the vault wouldn't open.
- I sense a 'but' coming on.

29:55.745 --> 29:58.680
Well, what happens
if someone were to be

29:58.681 --> 30:00.449
locked inside the vault?
You couldn't just

30:00.450 --> 30:01.817
leave them in there to suffocate.

30:01.818 --> 30:03.952
Are you saying there's
another way to open it?

30:03.953 --> 30:05.921
An emergency combination

30:05.922 --> 30:07.856
known only to the bank manager.

30:07.857 --> 30:10.359
I'd jotted it down on a piece
of paper and taped it

30:10.360 --> 30:12.194
underneath my drawer. I thought
no one would ever find it.

30:12.195 --> 30:13.795
And why didn't you
mention this before?

30:13.796 --> 30:15.430
Because it was
totally against protocol.

30:15.431 --> 30:17.591
- It could cost me my job.
- Well, it still might.

30:18.501 --> 30:20.903
I have a wife
with six children to feed,

30:20.904 --> 30:22.637
and one more on the way. Please.

30:26.376 --> 30:28.143
We'll see ourselves out.

30:34.317 --> 30:35.417
No!

30:35.418 --> 30:38.186
I'm done listening to you, Knight!

30:38.187 --> 30:41.456
You listen to me.
Why don't you just shut up

30:41.457 --> 30:42.858
and do what you're supposed to do?

30:42.859 --> 30:44.560
This'll all be over in two hours,

30:44.561 --> 30:45.894
after which we both take our cash

30:45.895 --> 30:47.963
and never speak
to each other again. Got it?

30:56.239 --> 30:58.640
Yes, I'd like to place a call, please.

31:00.410 --> 31:02.077
Oh!

31:04.414 --> 31:06.281
Drake Private Detectives.

31:08.151 --> 31:10.185
Bad time to be making a call.

31:15.525 --> 31:16.658
Is it?

31:16.659 --> 31:18.260
You need to get out there
and say your lines.

31:18.261 --> 31:20.495
- You are up to something.
- That's not your concern.

31:20.496 --> 31:22.264
I think it is.

31:22.265 --> 31:24.967
Your only concern right now
is going out there

31:24.968 --> 31:26.335
and saying your lines.

31:26.336 --> 31:28.436
No.

31:29.939 --> 31:32.541
Well, I'd hate for something
bad to happen to you.

31:33.409 --> 31:34.943
Or to your friend, Huey.

31:37.580 --> 31:39.214
So, what will it be?

31:43.386 --> 31:44.886
Smart girl.

31:52.071 --> 31:54.598
So Pike gets into
the bank manager's office

31:54.599 --> 31:56.901
and steals the combination
to the time-lock.

31:56.902 --> 31:59.003
Then he gives the code to Knight.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.339
And he shoots Pike as a thank you?

32:01.340 --> 32:03.507
But if all he wanted was the code,

32:03.508 --> 32:05.409
why did he steal the $7500?

32:05.410 --> 32:07.144
That's pennies compared
to what's in the vault.

32:07.145 --> 32:08.779
And if he already has the combination,

32:08.780 --> 32:10.982
what's he waiting for?

32:10.983 --> 32:12.616
Maybe that's a question
for Detective Greyson.

32:12.617 --> 32:14.585
Shouldn't we let him
know what's going on?

32:14.586 --> 32:17.555
All we have are some pieces
of a plant in a drawer.

32:17.556 --> 32:20.157
True. But maybe you're also trying

32:20.158 --> 32:21.725
to keep Greyson at arm's length?

32:22.961 --> 32:25.830
- No.
- That's the sort of 'no'

32:25.831 --> 32:27.398
that's closer to a 'yes'.

32:29.201 --> 32:30.534
You know, sometimes it's not easy

32:30.535 --> 32:32.870
having a detective as a best friend.

32:45.017 --> 32:46.550
Thank you, Father Gilmore.

32:46.551 --> 32:49.687
We remind you to tune in every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday

32:49.688 --> 32:51.355
for more praise and fiddling.

32:51.356 --> 32:53.124
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

32:53.125 --> 32:55.159
it is time for something very special.

33:01.266 --> 33:03.000
That's odd...

33:03.001 --> 33:05.135
the radio just cut out
after Father Gilmore.

33:06.772 --> 33:08.272
But first, a warning:

33:08.273 --> 33:10.574
what you are about to hear
may seem real,

33:10.575 --> 33:12.810
but it is a work of fiction
produced by our station

33:12.811 --> 33:14.178
for your listening pleasure.

33:17.382 --> 33:19.517
And now, good listeners,
we take you live

33:19.518 --> 33:20.918
to an unfolding news story.

33:23.822 --> 33:25.656
We're trying to reach our reporter.

33:25.657 --> 33:27.097
Are you there? Can you hear us?

33:30.762 --> 33:33.297
Uh, yes, I can hear you.

33:33.298 --> 33:35.466
This is Edna Simpson,

33:35.467 --> 33:36.767
your on-the-scene reporter,

33:36.768 --> 33:40.404
who finds herself
in the most dire of situations.

33:40.405 --> 33:41.605
She's good.

33:41.606 --> 33:43.274
The whole thing sounds good.

33:43.275 --> 33:44.775
A confidential source tipped me

33:44.776 --> 33:46.377
that something big would be happening

33:46.378 --> 33:47.645
at the Don Jail tonight...

33:47.646 --> 33:49.780
and it is.

33:53.985 --> 33:56.020
Somehow, the prisoners
have been armed,

33:56.021 --> 33:57.455
and they are rioting.

33:59.858 --> 34:02.460
And Toronto police forces
are responding.

34:05.330 --> 34:08.099
But they are outnumbered 10 to 1.

34:08.100 --> 34:10.534
They've walked into
a deadly situation.

34:14.973 --> 34:16.474
She's really committing to the fear.

34:16.475 --> 34:18.141
Almost too much.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.110
If someone doesn't do something soon,

34:20.112 --> 34:22.313
this could turn into a massacre.

34:22.313 --> 34:25.116
Operator, give me the police.

34:25.117 --> 34:26.350
- Toronto police.
- Toronto police, please hold.

34:26.351 --> 34:27.710
- Go ahead.
- Who am I speaking to?

34:29.487 --> 34:31.288
We'll get right on it. Yes, sir.

34:32.324 --> 34:33.924
Listen up, boys:
we've got a full-blown riot

34:33.925 --> 34:35.292
down at the Don. Thank you.

34:35.293 --> 34:37.094
Chief wants all hands on deck.

34:37.094 --> 34:38.594
Let's go! Go!

34:51.576 --> 34:53.110
Do you hear that?

34:53.911 --> 34:55.579
Something's making a tapping sound.

34:55.580 --> 34:57.314
Thing's on the blink again.

34:57.315 --> 34:59.917
No, no, no!
It- it's rhythmic and repeating.

35:01.653 --> 35:03.387
It's beneath the sound effects.

35:05.323 --> 35:07.324
- Trudy, that's Morse code.
- From who?

35:07.325 --> 35:10.060
Mary!

35:13.031 --> 35:14.765
I'm going to go.

35:16.601 --> 35:18.536
Ah... ah. Oh, no!

35:18.537 --> 35:23.073
My position is being overrun
by prisoner thugs!

35:23.074 --> 35:25.876
"SOS... Knight... at... bank."

35:25.877 --> 35:28.479
Knight's robbing the bank right now!

35:31.449 --> 35:32.616
Operator. Police, please.

35:32.617 --> 35:35.619
Hey! Get off me, you...

35:35.620 --> 35:38.789
- Telephone lines are jammed.
- We need to get to the bank.

35:40.792 --> 35:42.726
Cute. You got the idea of Morse code

35:42.727 --> 35:45.062
- from reading the script.
- It's over, Mr. Rockwell.

35:45.063 --> 35:47.398
Is it? I don't think anyone
in a million years would have

35:47.399 --> 35:48.899
- pieced this all together.
- You're wrong.

35:48.900 --> 35:50.601
OK, maybe I am.

35:50.602 --> 35:53.938
But if that's so,
I need a little insurance...

35:53.939 --> 35:55.539
and that's you. Now, get moving!

35:55.540 --> 35:58.409
Go! Get moving!

36:08.887 --> 36:10.320
Tom Knight!

36:11.156 --> 36:13.224
What the hell's going on? Who's she?

36:13.225 --> 36:15.092
Someone who's too smart
for her own good.

36:15.093 --> 36:16.493
- So she figured it out?
- Like I said,

36:16.494 --> 36:18.362
she's a smart girl.

36:21.333 --> 36:23.013
The hell do you think you're doing?!

36:23.935 --> 36:25.302
- Damn it!
- Don't you realize

36:25.303 --> 36:27.538
- we have the combination?
- When we get this door open,

36:27.539 --> 36:30.174
don't do anything stupid
and we'll go easy on you.

36:31.710 --> 36:32.977
Actually, we'll go easy on you.

36:32.978 --> 36:35.546
Don't even think about running.

36:40.552 --> 36:42.987
Mary? Mary, are you OK?

36:42.988 --> 36:44.922
We're going to get you out of there!

36:49.894 --> 36:51.362
She says she's safe.

36:51.363 --> 36:53.230
Good. Now, let's get her

36:53.231 --> 36:54.958
out of there before Greyson shows up.

37:01.499 --> 37:03.367
So, David never knew the whole plan?

37:03.368 --> 37:05.102
His role was just to steal

37:05.103 --> 37:06.937
the combination to the time-lock.

37:06.938 --> 37:09.240
And the radio broadcast?

37:09.241 --> 37:11.442
A diversion to pull the cops away

37:11.443 --> 37:13.544
while Knight broke into the vault.

37:13.545 --> 37:16.146
But keeping a radio station
afloat is very expensive,

37:16.147 --> 37:18.849
so they needed the $7500

37:18.850 --> 37:21.051
your husband was transporting
to pay it off.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.354
I wonder what David was thinking,

37:23.355 --> 37:24.989
getting in with those crooks.

37:24.990 --> 37:27.758
Maybe he was gonna use
the money to whisk you away.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.160
You think?

37:30.161 --> 37:32.529
It seems like what you two had
was pretty special.

37:33.665 --> 37:36.467
It was. Thank you.

37:36.468 --> 37:38.135
For everything.

37:39.404 --> 37:40.838
Of course.

37:40.839 --> 37:43.340
So, what will you do now?

37:43.341 --> 37:45.676
I have a bit of insurance money.

37:45.677 --> 37:47.878
I thought I might
buy a little bakery...

37:47.879 --> 37:50.380
go into business baking pies.

37:51.216 --> 37:54.218
- Pies?
- Not just pies. Cookies, cakes,

37:54.219 --> 37:56.954
- scones, you name it.
- This is not what we expected.

37:56.955 --> 37:59.056
Well, if there's one thing
David taught me,

37:59.057 --> 38:02.226
it's that people are
just full of surprises.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.967
Drink at Quon's?

38:10.769 --> 38:12.236
I'd love to, but...

38:12.237 --> 38:14.104
I think I need to clear
things up with Bill.

38:14.105 --> 38:15.472
Good luck.

38:15.473 --> 38:17.040
Thanks.

38:31.823 --> 38:33.457
I guess with Mr. Rockwell in jail,

38:33.458 --> 38:35.893
you're out of a job. I'm so sorry.

38:35.894 --> 38:37.828
Your broadcasting days are over, too.

38:37.829 --> 38:39.697
Well, yes...

38:39.698 --> 38:42.499
But, to be honest, I'm a bit relieved.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.301
It was very stressful.

38:45.337 --> 38:47.671
Besides, I'm a police
officer at heart.

38:48.606 --> 38:50.574
And what are you going to do?
You love radio.

38:50.575 --> 38:52.776
I'll let you in on a secret.

38:52.777 --> 38:55.779
I've talked a local newspaper
into buying the station.

38:56.915 --> 38:58.615
Huey, that's wonderful!

38:58.616 --> 39:00.184
More plays?

39:00.185 --> 39:01.852
I don't think the world's
quite ready for that yet,

39:01.853 --> 39:04.755
but there is something to this
whole live event thing.

39:04.756 --> 39:06.156
So, we're going to focus on sports.

39:06.157 --> 39:08.258
- Sports?
- Just imagine listening

39:08.259 --> 39:10.127
to the Toronto St. Pats on the radio.

39:10.128 --> 39:12.129
It would be like being there but
in the comfort of your own home.

39:12.130 --> 39:14.198
Right, that's a very good idea.

39:14.199 --> 39:15.866
Um...

39:15.867 --> 39:18.369
"Saturday Night Hockey with Huey..."

39:18.370 --> 39:20.804
Oh, my goodness, I don't know
your last name.

39:20.805 --> 39:23.340
Ah, it's Hewitt.
Yeah, Huey is short for Hewitt.

39:23.341 --> 39:25.676
- That's why they call me Huey.
- Oh, well, then what's

39:25.677 --> 39:27.878
- your first name?
- Foster.

39:29.814 --> 39:31.682
Well, Foster Hewitt...

39:33.485 --> 39:35.285
...it's been a pleasure
working with you.

39:36.287 --> 39:38.322
The pleasure was all mine.

39:41.459 --> 39:44.227
Mary, uh, you know, sometime...

39:48.133 --> 39:50.500
Well, sometime I was hoping
you'd come by to say hello.

39:52.437 --> 39:54.238
Sure.

39:54.239 --> 39:55.973
Oh, I'd love that, Huey.

40:01.646 --> 40:03.180
What will it be, Frankie?

40:03.181 --> 40:04.548
Cold tea, Wendy.

40:05.650 --> 40:07.284
And for your friend?

40:07.285 --> 40:09.052
I believe he likes cold tea as well.

40:09.988 --> 40:11.555
When I'm drinking with friends, I do.

40:11.556 --> 40:13.457
We're not friends?

40:14.459 --> 40:15.993
I'll have a ginger ale,
Wendy, thank you.

40:15.994 --> 40:17.894
Coming up, Detective.

40:19.063 --> 40:23.100
So, tonight was
a very interesting night.

40:23.101 --> 40:24.435
Oh?

40:24.436 --> 40:27.304
Yes, myself and most
of Toronto's finest responded

40:27.305 --> 40:30.908
to a prison break,
an imaginary prison break,

40:30.909 --> 40:32.609
that we heard reported on the radio.

40:32.610 --> 40:34.511
Sounds like quite the mix-up.

40:35.380 --> 40:36.780
We looked like complete idiots.

40:36.781 --> 40:39.450
Especially considering
there was a bank robbery

40:39.451 --> 40:41.485
going on in town
at the exact same time.

40:41.486 --> 40:43.620
And just a few blocks
from the police station.

40:43.621 --> 40:44.755
How embarrassing.

40:44.756 --> 40:46.723
Oh, it was.

40:46.724 --> 40:48.792
Well, luckily, someone had it
under control.

40:48.793 --> 40:51.528
If someone had chosen
to keep me in the loop,

40:51.529 --> 40:54.031
things might have turned out
a little differently.

40:54.032 --> 40:56.667
Everything happened so fast,
I had to move quick.

40:56.668 --> 40:58.302
Besides, the lines were busy,
we tried to call you.

40:58.303 --> 41:00.504
Were they busy when you found out

41:00.505 --> 41:02.105
about the stolen
time-lock combination?

41:02.106 --> 41:05.175
Look, if I had anything
concrete, I would have told you.

41:06.344 --> 41:08.745
On second thought, Wendy...

41:08.746 --> 41:10.647
bring me a cold tea.

41:10.648 --> 41:13.383
This won't be the last time
that we bump into each other.

41:13.384 --> 41:15.619
Here I was hoping it would be.

41:15.620 --> 41:17.387
And I was hoping
we could call a truce.

41:17.388 --> 41:19.556
I got a lot of stick
down at the station

41:19.557 --> 41:21.992
for letting myself be bettered
by a female PI.

41:21.993 --> 41:24.327
Won't be the last time.

41:28.967 --> 41:30.634
I got a feeling it won't.

41:33.872 --> 41:35.238
It's on you.

41:43.948 --> 41:46.083
Trudy?

41:46.084 --> 41:47.284
What are you doing here?

41:47.285 --> 41:49.353
I could ask you the same thing.

41:49.354 --> 41:51.788
- It's not what it seems.
- No?

41:51.789 --> 41:54.391
You aren't paying a call
to the woman in that house?

41:54.392 --> 41:56.593
The woman that smells like cheap
perfume and dresses like...

41:56.594 --> 41:59.963
- She's my dance instructor.
- Oh, come on.

41:59.964 --> 42:03.567
Trudy, you know me.
You know my family.

42:03.568 --> 42:04.768
They're good
church-going people, right?

42:04.769 --> 42:05.769
You trying to change the subject?

42:05.770 --> 42:07.170
Just listen.

42:08.306 --> 42:09.840
They don't dance.

42:10.909 --> 42:13.410
I never learned how.
And I know how much you love it

42:13.411 --> 42:15.979
and how good you are at it, and...

42:15.980 --> 42:18.215
I just wanted to be able
to dance with you.

42:18.216 --> 42:20.584
You expect me to believe this?

42:22.053 --> 42:23.554
I'll show you.

42:34.098 --> 42:35.365
So, how am I doing?

42:36.768 --> 42:38.268
All right.

42:40.038 --> 42:42.005
Better than all right.

42:44.208 --> 42:46.676
That woman's a good dance teacher.

42:47.478 --> 42:50.247
She is...

42:50.248 --> 42:51.715
but practice makes perfect.

42:58.590 --> 43:00.791
About your family...

43:04.596 --> 43:06.797
I think it's time
we told them about us.

43:13.738 --> 43:15.056
Oh!
