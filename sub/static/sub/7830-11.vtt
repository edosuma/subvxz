00:39.330 --> 00:40.457
Thank you,
Agnes.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.916
Let's begin.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.293
I'm happy to report

00:43.376 --> 00:45.045
that our shares
in Dynaflux Unimatics

00:45.128 --> 00:47.672
are up a delicious
seven and three-quarters.

00:47.756 --> 00:50.133
This means our investment
club portfolio

00:50.216 --> 00:52.635
has nearly doubled
in value.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.555
(murmuring)

00:55.638 --> 00:57.265
I suggest
we pump our profits

00:57.348 --> 00:59.517
into some new
high-risk ventures.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.478
Oh! Oh!
How about Oklasoft?

01:01.561 --> 01:03.605
It's Oklahoma's fastest-growing
software company.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.023
Um, cushions?

01:05.106 --> 01:06.775
Everybody likes
to sit on cushions.

01:06.858 --> 01:09.069
Children are
so fat today.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.154
Isn't there some way
we could make money off that?

01:11.237 --> 01:13.031
There's a franchise fair
this weekend.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.366
Why don't we buy
a business?

01:15.450 --> 01:16.618
(murmuring)

01:16.701 --> 01:18.203
I never thought of that.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.580
I'm not wild about
these high-risk ventures.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.165
They sound
a little risky.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.043
Oh, Marge.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.086
You are such
a wet blanket.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.587
If we'd listened
to you,

01:27.670 --> 01:30.006
we wouldn't have sponsored
that Mexican wrestler.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.009
Yet she still gets to share
in all the profits.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.427
-Mm-hmm.
-Is that fair?

01:34.511 --> 01:35.762
I guess I'm just
not comfortable

01:35.845 --> 01:38.848
with the whole idea
of "investing."

01:38.932 --> 01:40.391
Face it.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.519
You can't keep up
with the go-go '90s.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.354
Well, Marge...

01:44.437 --> 01:46.397
You're about as popular
as rug burn. (chuckles)

01:46.481 --> 01:48.441

of expelling Marge

01:48.525 --> 01:50.026

01:50.110 --> 01:51.694
ALL: Aye!

01:51.778 --> 01:54.072
All right, Helen.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.241
If I'm not wanted,
I'll leave.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.992
You'll get your pancakes
in the mail.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.495
MARGE:
And then they gave me back

02:00.578 --> 02:02.330
my $500 investment

02:02.413 --> 02:03.998
and kicked me
out of the club.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.208
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.960
Back up a bit now.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.170
When are the pancakes
coming in the mail?

02:09.254 --> 02:11.506
Well, maybe it's all
for the best.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.133
What do you need
to make money for anyway?

02:13.216 --> 02:15.260
As long as I have
my earning power,

02:15.343 --> 02:17.303
this family's got nothing
to worry about.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.055
Oww!

02:19.139 --> 02:22.058
Oh, call work and tell them
I won't be in tomorrow.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.893
Mom, this is no time
to be conservative.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.520
Let's roll

02:25.603 --> 02:26.938
It would be nice
to beat those women

02:27.021 --> 02:28.648
at their own game.

02:28.731 --> 02:32.068
Maybe I should
look into a franchise.

02:46.207 --> 02:48.376

03:08.271 --> 03:10.690
You get all the equipment

03:12.984 --> 03:14.694

03:14.777 --> 03:16.654
And while you're there,

03:16.738 --> 03:19.324
would you pick up some
of that nice green moon money

03:19.407 --> 03:21.409

03:21.492 --> 03:22.577

Now, folks, I don't want
to alarm you,

03:32.921 --> 03:34.881
Yeah, it's true,
and I hear you asking,

03:34.964 --> 03:37.342
"Well, who's going to straighten out
all these artistic abominations?"

03:37.425 --> 03:39.177

Good luck. Hey, you know,
maybe no one will notice.

03:45.141 --> 03:48.519
Maybe the problem
will just fix itself.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.355
Now, you're the one
who's being naive.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.940
Okay, fair enough.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.399
But you sound like

03:53.483 --> 03:54.817

your own boss

03:54.901 --> 03:57.320

of frame-nudging.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.739
Yes, for a minimal
franchise fee

03:59.822 --> 04:02.200
you'll receive a pair
of straightening gloves,

04:02.283 --> 04:04.285
a canister of wall lubricant,

04:04.369 --> 04:06.037
and a booklet of the most
commonly asked questions

04:06.120 --> 04:07.747

04:07.830 --> 04:10.667
including "Who are you?"
And "What are you doing here?"

04:10.750 --> 04:13.419

Uh, let's see.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.708
I'll have... One--

09:43.791 --> 09:44.834
Hey, hurry up.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.544
I want to get
my pretzel.

09:46.627 --> 09:47.545
One pretzel.

09:47.628 --> 09:48.838
Thank you.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.340
Uh, let's see, um...

09:51.424 --> 09:54.510
I will have
one of your, uh...

09:54.594 --> 09:56.137
Come on, come on,
while we're young.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.055
(honking)

09:58.139 --> 10:01.350
♪ <i>Don't stop thinking</i>
<i>about tomorrow... ♪</i>

10:01.434 --> 10:03.519
Wow, check out that van.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.438
It looks like it doesn't
even need our business.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.064
Hey, let's go.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.691

10:08.774 --> 10:10.651

10:14.322 --> 10:15.615
Excuse me.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.116
I had this spot first.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.744
Sorry, dear.
Just business. Ha!

10:19.827 --> 10:21.662
Well, I guess Macy's
and Gimbels learned

10:21.746 --> 10:22.997
to live side by side.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.916
Gimbels is gone,
Marge, long gone.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.168
You're Gimbels.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.836
Very well.

10:28.919 --> 10:31.088
There must be dozens
of great locations in this town.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.757
Don't you worry about me.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.720
Hey, slow down.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.889
I wants to talk to you.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.974
Give us 300 pretzels.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.770
You see? A little persistence
and patience paid off.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.730
That'll be $300.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.273
Hey, I don't think so.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.484
I got me 300 coupons.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.027
(Marge grumbles)

10:53.110 --> 10:56.030
I should have said,
"Limit: One per customer."

10:56.113 --> 10:58.658
Should've, but didn't,
so hand them over.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.994
Hey, kids, we're eating
dinner tonight.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.329
Come on, Tiffany,

11:03.412 --> 11:05.748
Heather, Cody, Dylan,

11:24.767 --> 11:26.310

11:30.564 --> 11:33.025
"Hang in there, baby."

11:33.109 --> 11:35.403
You said it, kitty.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.322
"Copyright 1968"?

11:38.406 --> 11:42.118
Hmm, determined or not,
that cat must be long dead.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.578
That's kind of a downer.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.122
They're good pretzels,
Mom,

11:46.205 --> 11:48.040
but you got to think big.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.669
Find a major public event
and set up shop there.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.507
Here you go.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.676
Free Pretzel Wagon pretzels
for everyone.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.262
One bite
and you'll be hooked.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.972
-Thank you.
-Gracias.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.266
That means
"Thank you," Marge.

And the 1997
Pontiac Astrowagon

12:15.359 --> 12:16.736
goes to the fan sitting

12:16.819 --> 12:21.490

12:38.883 --> 12:40.718
No. No, don't do that.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.137
You're supposed
to be tasting them.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.848
MAN 2: <i>Hall-of-famer Whitey Ford</i>

12:55.691 --> 12:57.735
This is a black day
for baseball.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.696
Oh, cheer up, Mom.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.656
You can't buy publicity
like that.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.493
Thousands and thousands
of people saw your pretzels

13:05.576 --> 13:07.203
injuring Whitey Ford.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.163
You could call them
Whitey-Whackers.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.624
I was wrong to have a dream--

13:11.707 --> 13:13.501
Wrong as usual.

13:13.584 --> 13:16.670
I mean, if you're nothing
special, why kid yourself?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.589
Oh, Mom, no.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.216
Listen to your mother,
kids.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.634
Aim low.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.804
Aim so low no one will
even care if you succeed.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.764
Dinner's in the oven.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.183
If you want some butter,
it's under my face.

13:31.227 --> 13:35.731
Marge needs help, and God knows
I'm not the man to provide it,

13:35.815 --> 13:37.650
but I know who can.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.325
Ah, it looks likes
Mr. Pretzel-man

13:46.408 --> 13:48.452
is doing pretty well
for himself.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.873
I'm here to see
Mr. Ormand.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.835
Of course.
Right this way.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.045
(organ playing)

13:58.128 --> 14:00.881
Oh, I guess I should speak
to the executor of his estate.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.758
He's right over there.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.301
They were in the same car.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.263
You're my last hope.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.181
I've never reached out
to you before,

14:09.265 --> 14:11.767
but my wife
is in her hour of need.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.979
Your help could make
all the difference in the world.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.480
FAT TONY: Okay.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.731
See, boss?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.400
I told you that ad
in the church bulletin

14:19.483 --> 14:20.776
would pay off.

14:23.028 --> 14:27.658
(phone ringing)

14:27.741 --> 14:31.036
Hello?

14:31.120 --> 14:34.248
No.
Pretzel Wagon's no longer...

14:34.331 --> 14:36.667
300 pretzels?

14:36.750 --> 14:38.502
Wait. Wait.
Let me get this down.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.087
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

14:40.170 --> 14:44.174
Meat Packer's Union Hall,
Batavia, New York.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.385
I'll send them right out.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.386
Homer.

14:47.469 --> 14:48.679
Homie, wake up.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.431
Wake up,
I'm back in business.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.684
I had a feeling things
would work out for you, honey.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.438
Hey, what are you doing?

14:57.521 --> 14:59.690
This is a pretzel town,
pretty boy.

14:59.773 --> 15:02.610
(jazz music plays)

15:49.907 --> 15:52.368
Are you sure the children
will get enough nutrition

15:52.451 --> 15:53.369
from these pretzels?

15:53.452 --> 15:55.371
Yes, I am sure.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.706
Sure as sure can be.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.875
Oh, my God,
what happened to your fingers?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.418
MAN WHISPERING:
Boating accident.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.463
I believe it was
a "boking" accident.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.424
I have to go now.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.552
I don't understand
why they won't unload

16:10.636 --> 16:12.304
our falafel fixings.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.681
Ship's impounded,
ma'am.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.224
Yeah. We found
a couple of barnacles

16:15.307 --> 16:16.392
on the hull.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.811
That and, uh,
the deck was, uh, wet.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.854
That's crazy.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.273
And what are those men
doing under my van?

16:23.357 --> 16:24.274
MAN:
Let's get out of here!

16:24.358 --> 16:25.776
Look, lady, if I was you,

16:25.859 --> 16:27.194
I would just leap
into the air

16:27.277 --> 16:28.195
as I'm preparing to do.

16:31.615 --> 16:32.533
Here you go, Homer.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.952
Thanks, Moe.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.955
Ah, Homer, you know
your money's no good here.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.165
Hey, wait a minute.
This is real money!

16:40.249 --> 16:42.710
Yeah.
My wife is raking it in.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.962
(bell rings)

16:45.045 --> 16:47.089
(whistling)

16:50.050 --> 16:51.719
(clears throat)

16:51.802 --> 16:53.012
Greetings, Homer.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.888
Hey, Fat Tony.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.473
You still with the mafia?

16:56.557 --> 16:59.059
Uh, yes, I am.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.436
Thank you for asking.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.355
Now, Homer,
as you no doubt recall,

17:03.439 --> 17:05.441
you were done
a favor by our--

17:05.524 --> 17:08.819
how shall I say--
mafia crime syndicate.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.113
Oh, yeah.

17:11.196 --> 17:15.117
Now the time has come
for you to do us a favor.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.327
You mean the mob
only did me a favor

17:17.411 --> 17:19.329
to get something
in return?

17:19.413 --> 17:22.041
Oh, Fat Tony...

17:22.124 --> 17:25.002
I will say good day
to you, sir.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.296
Okay, I will go.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.801
Hey, wait a minute.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.931
Well, here I am,

17:38.015 --> 17:41.518
11905 Dead Weasel Road.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.645
I don't see any apartment
building.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.022
I just...

17:45.105 --> 17:47.399
-(tires squealing)
-(Marge screams)

17:47.483 --> 17:50.277
Hey, what's going on?

17:56.825 --> 18:00.120
Is there a button
or a release for these keys?

18:00.204 --> 18:02.664
Oh. Oh, you have
to push in as you turn.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.084
-Ah.
-Yeah, that's it.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.045
-Who are you?
-We are your business partners,

18:08.128 --> 18:11.757
and as such, we are entitled
to a percentage of your profits.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.260
Something in the area
of 100%.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.804
What are you talking about?

18:16.887 --> 18:18.388
We suggest you have
a conversation

18:18.472 --> 18:19.890
with your husband.

18:19.973 --> 18:23.143
You have 24 hours
to give us our money.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.854
And to show you
we're serious,

18:25.938 --> 18:27.231
you have 12 hours.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.234
-Huh?
-See you at 6 a.m.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.364
Homer, did you
tell the mafia

18:35.447 --> 18:36.907
they could eliminate
my competitors

18:36.990 --> 18:39.243
with savage beatings
and attempted murder?

18:39.326 --> 18:41.537
In those words?

18:41.620 --> 18:42.621
Yes.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.415
It just sickens me.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.417
How could you do this
to someone you love?

18:47.501 --> 18:49.378
How could I not?

18:49.461 --> 18:50.963
I saw you pouring
your heart and soul

18:51.046 --> 18:52.840
into this business
and getting nowhere.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.258
I saw
you desperately trying

18:54.341 --> 18:55.676
to cram one more
salty treat

18:55.759 --> 18:57.970
into America's
already bloated snack hole.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.013
So I did what I could.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.307
I did what any
loving husband would do.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.643
I reached out to some
violent mobsters.

19:04.726 --> 19:07.563
Oh, Homer,
I know you were trying

19:07.646 --> 19:09.148
to shield me from failure

19:09.231 --> 19:11.150
but this is my business,

19:11.233 --> 19:14.278
and the mafia's not getting
one cent of my money.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.779
So what are
we going to do?

19:15.863 --> 19:17.739
We're going to do what
we do every day.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.825
We're going
to make pretzels.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.419
There.
That's the last one.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.133
(pretzel snaps)

19:36.216 --> 19:37.593
(knocking on door)

19:37.676 --> 19:38.552
(both gasp)

19:42.764 --> 19:45.434
I had that dream again.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.437
Oh, thank God,
it's only Grampa.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.315
-(knocking)
-Now what?

19:51.398 --> 19:55.485
-(both gasp)
-Sorry we're late.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.404
Could we have
the money now?

19:57.487 --> 19:59.489
The answer is no.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.159
I'm afraid I must insist.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.661
You see, my wife,
she has been most vocal

20:04.745 --> 20:06.538
on the subject
of the pretzel monies.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.915
"Where's the money?

20:07.998 --> 20:09.458
"When are you going
to get the money?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.293
Why aren't you getting
the money now?"

20:11.376 --> 20:12.628
And so on.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.880
So, please... The money.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.549
You heard her.
She said no.

20:17.633 --> 20:21.887
Legs, Louie, advance on them.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.847
HELEN LOVEJOY:
There they are.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.519
Well, well,
if it isn't Marge Simpson

20:29.603 --> 20:31.021
and her gangland cronies.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.773
Your goon squads certainly
gave you the edge

20:32.856 --> 20:34.441
in the mobile
snack business.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.944
But I'm afraid we've outdone
you once again.

20:37.027 --> 20:40.155
Hiroshi, Yukio.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.658
Perhaps you've heard
of the Yakuza,

20:42.741 --> 20:45.118
the Poison Fists
of the Pacific Rim?

20:45.202 --> 20:47.120
The Japanese mafia.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.624
They'll kill you five times
before you hit the ground.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.419
-All right.
-Go!

20:57.422 --> 20:59.383
(grunting)

21:04.263 --> 21:05.138
Hey!

21:06.765 --> 21:09.351
Take that.
Take this.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.437
Come here,
you little squirt.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.941
Homie, maybe
we should go inside.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.276
But, Marge,
that little guy

21:17.359 --> 21:18.986
hasn't done
anything yet.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.697
Look at him.
He's going to do something

21:21.780 --> 21:23.615
and you know it's going
to be good.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.493

-(body thuds)

21:27.786 --> 21:30.205
-Aw...
-(blows landing)

21:30.289 --> 21:31.540
You must hate me,
Marge.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.083
Every time I try to help,

21:33.166 --> 21:34.584
I just fail miserably.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.004
Oh, I don't hate you
for failing.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.673
I love you for trying.

21:39.756 --> 21:42.342
-(yawning)
-What's going on outside?

21:42.426 --> 21:44.303
Oh, it's just
a mob war.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.721
Go back to sleep,
honey.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.934
Forgiveness, please.
