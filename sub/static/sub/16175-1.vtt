03:59.175 --> 04:01.409
Turn it off.

04:07.552 --> 04:08.867
Give me the keys.

04:22.965 --> 04:26.635
- How bad is it?
- I can make it.

04:27.035 --> 04:29.804
I only got one more day. I can make it.

04:45.671 --> 04:47.372
Please.

04:48.307 --> 04:50.023
Let me see it.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.551
I went straight through, thank God.

04:55.233 --> 04:57.469
- You got lucky.
- This is lucky?

04:58.049 --> 05:00.568
Yeah, darling, this is lucky.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.190
It's okay, baby.

05:04.690 --> 05:07.193
You may want to bite something.

05:15.533 --> 05:19.735
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Spent three years in the desert, darling.

05:24.977 --> 05:28.547
I need you to hold still. All right?

05:55.273 --> 05:57.529
Your plates are swapped.
You're good until Alabama.

05:57.909 --> 06:01.940
If you get woozy, you take a bump.
Not a line, a bump.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.216
Go straight down this road
and keep your lights off.

06:04.316 --> 06:07.151
You keep 'em fucking off
until you hit the pavement.

06:08.051 --> 06:11.187
- You understand me?
- Thank you so much.

07:00.305 --> 07:02.049
What's he doing?

07:03.041 --> 07:05.276
He's shooting rabbits.

07:05.976 --> 07:07.745
What's he doing that for?

07:07.845 --> 07:11.114
'Cause they're like squirrels,
chewing and digging everything up.

07:12.917 --> 07:15.653
Or maybe this is
what people do around here.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.690
What, is he like a tweaker or something?

07:22.159 --> 07:24.661
No, he's not a tweaker.

07:26.197 --> 07:28.372
How do you know?

07:30.568 --> 07:32.570
His aim's too good.

07:51.006 --> 07:52.773
Seriously?

07:56.528 --> 07:58.217
You're such a jerk.

07:59.047 --> 08:00.589
I'm late, babe.

08:04.836 --> 08:08.038
Johnny, when are you coming back?

08:09.341 --> 08:13.355
I don't know.
It... it shouldn't take too long.

08:24.822 --> 08:27.224
A few hours.
I can stop and get lunch if you want.

08:27.324 --> 08:29.027
No.

08:30.627 --> 08:32.929
What is it, then?

08:33.731 --> 08:35.533
Nothing.

08:50.132 --> 08:52.437
This is temporary.

08:53.418 --> 08:55.620
How temporary?

08:57.823 --> 09:00.764
A few more deliveries and we're cool.

09:01.426 --> 09:05.464
I get straight with my uncle,
and then we can get Oceanside, you know?

09:06.164 --> 09:08.917
Someplace nobody can find us.

09:16.023 --> 09:20.495
We're close, babe.
We're really, really close.

10:41.726 --> 10:43.929
You come in late...

10:44.329 --> 10:46.297
you come in short...

10:46.397 --> 10:49.900
and you've brought me a side of attitude.

10:53.639 --> 10:56.541
I've been sticking
my fucking neck out for you.

10:56.641 --> 10:58.175
I get it.

10:58.275 --> 11:00.445
You know, I read that...

11:01.045 --> 11:05.448
the number one reason
people give for office theft...

11:06.384 --> 11:09.387
is "the company owes me something."

11:13.191 --> 11:17.298
You see that employee right there?
My nephew.

11:20.131 --> 11:22.133
He knows how to do his job.

11:22.433 --> 11:24.756
He keeps it clean.

11:25.036 --> 11:29.041
And he knows that
I don't owe nobody jack shit.

11:29.341 --> 11:32.044
That's why he's gonna grow old and fat.

11:32.644 --> 11:36.147
And you... I don't know about you.

11:37.716 --> 11:41.652
Guille, get this jackass out of here
before I lose my temper.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.192
Sorry to keep ya.

11:48.193 --> 11:50.528
Training day.

11:51.428 --> 11:56.000
- Big delivery today, John.
- Oh, yeah? What should I expect?

11:56.100 --> 11:59.671
100. Not a penny less.

12:00.171 --> 12:02.840
- 100.
- Light me a goddamn cigarette.

12:02.940 --> 12:05.377
Go on, Guille.

12:05.977 --> 12:07.766
How's things out at the ranch?

12:07.866 --> 12:10.999
Rosie's complaining about the bugs a little,
but other than that, everything's good.

12:11.099 --> 12:13.435
You're doing pretty good for yourself?

12:14.185 --> 12:16.253
No problems, right?

12:16.353 --> 12:21.159
So if anything was bothering you,
you'd tell me, right?

12:22.261 --> 12:24.539
I mean, yeah, of course.

12:24.639 --> 12:27.240
Of course I would. Everything's good.

12:30.736 --> 12:32.270
You...

12:33.070 --> 12:35.541
your daddy was like you.

12:35.641 --> 12:37.943
The devil keep his soul.

12:38.043 --> 12:40.401
He didn't say much...

12:40.501 --> 12:42.480
but when he did...

12:46.550 --> 12:52.189
He saved my neck more times
than I can even think about.

12:52.289 --> 12:55.526
I owed him, you see?

12:55.626 --> 12:59.631
And that's why I took you in,
taught you how to be a man, you know?

12:59.731 --> 13:03.268
I mean, you said you wanted
to go in the Service.

13:03.368 --> 13:05.370
I allowed it.

13:05.470 --> 13:09.441
- Yeah.
- But that's over now, John, you know?

13:09.541 --> 13:15.213
You've done your time.
You at home now with family, right?

13:15.313 --> 13:18.283
Where you belong, no?

13:18.383 --> 13:20.118
I know, Neil.

13:21.519 --> 13:25.154
- Uncle Neil.
- Uncle Neil.

13:25.756 --> 13:27.524
Yeah.

13:28.626 --> 13:29.660
Yeah.

15:22.973 --> 15:24.718
Is there a problem, Officer?

15:24.818 --> 15:27.511
Step out of the vehicle.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.590
Have an appointment today, Johnny?

15:39.090 --> 15:41.726
Make a little pickup from your uncle?

15:41.826 --> 15:45.949
- I'm clean.
- Bullshit. You was born dirty.

15:47.898 --> 15:50.768
You know better
than to leave it out in the open.

15:50.868 --> 15:53.571
Maybe you're hiding it someplace else.

15:53.671 --> 15:57.123
Someplace I gotta look
a little harder to find.

15:58.343 --> 16:01.779
You think I don't know
what goes on here, Johnny?

16:02.179 --> 16:05.816
Your kind rots this town
from the inside out.

16:05.916 --> 16:10.154
And I don't take no shit
from two-bit dirt rats like you.

16:10.254 --> 16:15.586
No matter what your tats say,
you'll always be scum under my boots.

16:19.130 --> 16:22.832
- What you say to me?
- I just said you're not wrong.

16:27.270 --> 16:30.975
You're clean. Guess you weren't lying.

16:31.175 --> 16:33.476
Drive safe, Johnny.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.245
What happened to you?

18:16.346 --> 18:18.614
It ain't mine.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.989
How's that gal of yours?

18:26.089 --> 18:28.091
She's sick.

18:29.327 --> 18:31.563
Is she inside?

18:32.063 --> 18:33.864
Nope.

18:36.234 --> 18:38.236
Well, I hope she's all right.

18:48.912 --> 18:51.314
See ya in a few days.

19:10.267 --> 19:12.460
Hey, what happened?

19:12.560 --> 19:14.637
All good.

19:24.215 --> 19:26.724
There was a good amount.

19:26.824 --> 19:28.947
How much?

19:29.886 --> 19:32.855
I think it was like 100 grand
or something.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.779
100 grand?

19:38.061 --> 19:40.464
How much of that do we get?

19:41.366 --> 19:43.000
25.

19:43.100 --> 19:47.905
Tomorrow, the white bag goes to Neil,
and we get the fuck out of here.

19:48.805 --> 19:51.409
I knew you could do it.
I knew you could do it.

19:54.544 --> 19:56.979
I knew we could do it.

20:33.584 --> 20:36.120
What if we took all of it?

20:36.620 --> 20:39.722
Neil would hunt us down and kill us.

20:48.366 --> 20:50.888
Is he gonna kill us if we leave?

20:50.988 --> 20:55.438
Well, not fucking him over
would certainly help him cope.

21:00.410 --> 21:02.413
We could really use the whole 100.

21:02.513 --> 21:06.518
Yeah, we could, right?
It'd certainly make a difference.

21:06.618 --> 21:10.337
That would be greedy.
Greed makes people unlucky.

21:15.223 --> 21:17.061
Yeah?

21:18.830 --> 21:20.298
Hey, neighbor.

21:20.398 --> 21:24.301
Hey, listen, I hate to bother you so late,
but, got a question for you.

21:24.401 --> 21:26.104
All right.

21:26.204 --> 21:28.840
Brought over a couple cold ones.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.576
Yeah, come on in.

21:31.676 --> 21:34.979
- All right, cool, thanks.
- Have a seat over there.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.948
Thank you.

21:46.756 --> 21:49.706
- What's he want?
- I don't know.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.901
- So what's going on?
- I appreciate it.

21:58.001 --> 21:59.736
Yeah.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.749
By any chance, were you on my land today?

22:04.849 --> 22:08.779
Yeah. Yeah, your trashcan was laying
in the middle of the road.

22:08.879 --> 22:11.069
Just drug it back up to your house.

22:11.169 --> 22:13.050
All right.

22:13.150 --> 22:15.352
Makes me feel better.

22:15.452 --> 22:18.755
Found some tracks, you know, I didn't know
if someone was trying to rob me or whatever.

22:18.855 --> 22:21.459
Hell, you can't tell about people
in these parts.

22:21.559 --> 22:24.027
Nope, that was just me.

22:26.430 --> 22:29.366
You gonna keep peeking around
that corner or you gonna come out?

22:36.406 --> 22:39.109
- Good to meet you.
- How you doing?

22:39.209 --> 22:40.977
I'm Rosie.

22:44.714 --> 22:48.104
We don't get too many women
good-looking as you around these parts.

22:54.891 --> 22:57.092
Y'all married?

22:59.629 --> 23:01.397
Yeah.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.201
All right.

23:08.471 --> 23:11.039
Just wondering who you was.

23:13.109 --> 23:15.147
I'm Rosie.

23:16.347 --> 23:18.549
Night, baby.

23:22.152 --> 23:24.754
Yeah, I got me one of those.

23:27.158 --> 23:29.194
Yeah, they're pretty good
for looking at the stars.

23:29.294 --> 23:32.095
I use mine for looking at my neighbors.

23:37.233 --> 23:39.937
I'm just screwing with you,
John boy, come on.

23:42.340 --> 23:47.311
No, but I do watch that road out front.
See some pretty interesting things.

23:49.913 --> 23:53.950
Sometimes a car will come in light
with one pair of plates.

23:55.585 --> 23:59.850
Hour later, goes out heavy
with another pair of plates.

24:01.057 --> 24:03.359
Ain't that weird?

24:04.828 --> 24:07.264
We all got our secrets.

24:07.364 --> 24:09.733
I ain't no hypocrite.

24:09.833 --> 24:13.136
You do what you do, I do what I do.

24:14.671 --> 24:18.342
That's why we live out in these parts.
Don't want to be bothered by others.

24:20.176 --> 24:24.316
Well, I better be heading on back.
My boys gonna be gettin' home at any second.

24:25.016 --> 24:29.487
Hey, come on by sometime.
I owe you for a cold one.

24:30.087 --> 24:32.388
Nighty night, neighbor.

26:54.398 --> 26:56.427
Stop being nosy, babe.

26:56.527 --> 27:00.236
And pack your bags, we gotta go
as soon as I get back, all right?

27:11.247 --> 27:13.950
Are you sure you're ready for this?

27:14.350 --> 27:16.151
Yeah.

27:17.604 --> 27:21.725
Yeah? Leaving everyone?
Friends and family and everyone?

27:21.825 --> 27:24.326
We don't have any friends.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.639
This...

27:56.727 --> 27:58.963
I'll see ya, babe.

28:32.562 --> 28:34.884
Should just buy everything new.

29:52.309 --> 29:56.945
- Hey, any bumps on the road?
- Nope. All good.

29:57.682 --> 29:59.683
All right.

30:02.402 --> 30:04.305
Here you go.

30:04.405 --> 30:06.289
Try this.

30:06.389 --> 30:08.426
I'm not that hungry, but...

30:08.826 --> 30:11.627
I didn't ask you if you were hungry.

30:13.363 --> 30:14.522
Where you going, John?

30:14.622 --> 30:16.869
I'm not going anywhere.
What the fuck are you talking about?

30:16.969 --> 30:20.046
This is a small town, boy.
There's no secrets I don't hear.

30:20.146 --> 30:22.245
I don't know what you're listening to,
but it's bullshit.

30:22.345 --> 30:24.308
- Bullshit?
- Why would I fuck you over?

30:24.408 --> 30:27.109
You're the only family I got.

30:29.313 --> 30:31.715
You are right for Hallmark, boy.

30:35.218 --> 30:38.488
I hear everything. Everything.

30:38.588 --> 30:41.725
Sometimes I hear things I don't like.

30:41.825 --> 30:46.630
Now, I rely on a lot of people.
Most especially you.

30:47.430 --> 30:49.977
I can't afford for there
to be any dissension.

30:51.535 --> 30:53.369
You understand?

30:53.969 --> 30:56.432
Even if we are family...

31:15.691 --> 31:19.329
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Pick up the phone!

31:39.450 --> 31:44.345
<i>At the tone, please record your message.
When you finish recording, you may hang...</i>

31:56.133 --> 31:57.367
Rosie?

33:21.951 --> 33:23.753
Troy!

33:33.529 --> 33:37.087
You didn't happen to see Rosie
come by here in last hour or so, did you?

33:37.187 --> 33:39.737
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
Caused quite a dust storm.

33:39.837 --> 33:42.980
Seemed she was in a big
old hurry to get somewhere.

33:45.841 --> 33:48.445
Yeah, see that?
That's why I don't mess with 'em.

33:48.545 --> 33:50.714
What's that?

33:50.814 --> 33:54.751
Pretty girls.
Will break your heart every time.

37:13.282 --> 37:15.085
Troy?

37:17.988 --> 37:20.222
Got those beers.

39:13.068 --> 39:15.471
You motherfucker.

44:24.346 --> 44:27.529
Fuck. Hey.

44:32.622 --> 44:35.024
Kid, you better get up.

44:53.309 --> 44:56.144
- You're not one of them?
- I'm not one of them.

44:56.244 --> 44:58.180
- You have to help me get out.
- I'm gonna help you.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.887
- Your last name, what's your name?
- I'm Sarah.

45:00.987 --> 45:04.344
- Sarah? They're not gonna hurt you.
- Please. They took my friend Cole.

45:04.444 --> 45:07.823
- You have to help me find him.
- I know, I know. I just saw him next door.

45:07.923 --> 45:12.265
No, that's not him. You have to find him.
You have to help him. Please.

45:12.365 --> 45:14.541
I'm going to.
I just need you to stay quiet, all right?

45:14.641 --> 45:18.062
- People don't make it out of here.
- Girl, you gotta be quiet, all right?

45:18.162 --> 45:21.169
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

45:31.947 --> 45:33.404
Shit!

45:34.584 --> 45:37.287
John! Holy shit. John, he's fucking crazy.

45:37.387 --> 45:41.291
- John... Help me, John, help me.
- Slow down. Slow down, slow down.

45:41.391 --> 45:44.352
John... get me out of here.

45:44.452 --> 45:47.129
Get me out of here, please!

45:47.229 --> 45:49.097
Please.

45:54.002 --> 45:57.874
- This lock, babe, I need bolt cutters.
- No, no, you don't. No, just break it off!

45:57.974 --> 46:01.520
Just break it the fuck off!
Get me out of here, John, please!

46:01.620 --> 46:03.586
Stop!

46:09.885 --> 46:11.349
Fuck.

46:15.958 --> 46:18.595
- Fuck.
- It's him. It's him. He's back.

46:18.695 --> 46:20.248
Fuck. He's back.

46:31.708 --> 46:35.378
- Fuck. John...
- I can take him.

46:35.878 --> 46:38.381
I'll stop this.

46:38.481 --> 46:40.534
- I can take him.
- Okay.

46:40.634 --> 46:44.399
He doesn't know that I'm here.
He's by himself.

46:44.499 --> 46:47.265
- John. Johnny.
- One blow and he's done.

46:49.726 --> 46:53.062
- I'll be back before you know it.
- Okay. John...

48:44.807 --> 48:47.075
About damn time.

48:52.014 --> 48:55.685
Well, which one of you dumbshits
forgot how to tie a slipknot?

48:55.785 --> 48:59.167
It's nice to see you, too, Daddy.
You got any aspirin?

48:59.267 --> 49:02.758
Aspirin? I'm the one who needs aspirin.

49:03.358 --> 49:06.081
I had that kid's dad on the hook for 50K.

49:06.181 --> 49:09.698
- Now we ain't got shit.
- You know, you didn't have to kill him.

49:09.798 --> 49:13.135
He saw my face.
What'd you expect me to do?

49:13.235 --> 49:15.772
I'm sorry, okay?

49:16.172 --> 49:20.910
- What do you want from me?
- You're gonna dig the damn hole. Alone.

49:21.510 --> 49:25.535
Hell, like I've never dug
a goddamn hole before.

49:26.015 --> 49:28.694
Cooper, you all right?

49:29.560 --> 49:32.380
Yeah. Just allergies.

49:33.423 --> 49:37.692
- It's not allergies.
- Harley, give us a sec, would you?

49:39.644 --> 49:41.779
Goddamn it.

49:44.199 --> 49:46.001
Cooper...

49:47.403 --> 49:49.439
it's okay to be scared.

49:49.839 --> 49:52.841
When your mom died, I was scared.

49:52.941 --> 49:55.044
I didn't know how we was gonna survive.

49:56.444 --> 49:59.983
But we made it work, didn't we?
We found a way.

50:00.783 --> 50:03.338
Now, can it get ugly? Yeah.

50:03.438 --> 50:07.991
Did we ever mean to hurt these people?
No. Hell no.

50:08.091 --> 50:11.793
We was just trying to get a few bucks
from people who already got plenty.

50:11.893 --> 50:14.629
And then we was gonna give 'em back.

50:14.729 --> 50:17.364
You gotta know that, boy.

50:18.001 --> 50:21.570
Today... something went wrong.

50:22.305 --> 50:26.111
We just doing our best
to make it right and move on.

50:28.110 --> 50:29.985
Tonight...

50:30.085 --> 50:34.516
I'm gonna need you to do everything
I tell you, no matter what happens.

50:34.983 --> 50:37.186
Because tonight...

50:37.286 --> 50:41.224
we are gonna get everything
we need to survive.

50:41.324 --> 50:43.926
And then we ain't gonna be scared no more.

50:46.328 --> 50:49.966
You go get your brother and go
downstairs and I'll show you, okay?

50:50.066 --> 50:51.954
- Okay.
- I love you, son.

51:31.773 --> 51:34.544
All right, boys,
we got something special tonight.

51:34.644 --> 51:39.646
That little girl's dad is in real estate
development. He's worth about five mill.

51:40.283 --> 51:43.819
But the mom, she's loaded.

51:44.119 --> 51:46.555
I figure her inheritance
is worth about 35.

51:46.855 --> 51:48.738
Which means...

51:48.838 --> 51:52.762
little Blondie in there
oughta fetch about high six figures.

51:53.262 --> 51:57.032
Boys, we do this right...

51:57.132 --> 51:59.301
we are set.

51:59.601 --> 52:03.438
- Well, hell, let's just ask for seven.
- No, no.

52:03.538 --> 52:05.508
We play by the rules...

52:05.608 --> 52:08.177
just enough till they know we're serious,

52:08.277 --> 52:11.213
but not too much that they're
gonna go call the cops.

52:11.313 --> 52:12.981
All right?

52:13.081 --> 52:15.383
Let's get to work.

52:28.864 --> 52:32.000
- Which one's yours, bud?
- Don't matter, either one.

52:32.100 --> 52:36.238
Well, it kinda does matter.
I don't want your fucking sickness.

52:36.338 --> 52:38.874
Allergies, asshole.

52:44.030 --> 52:46.231
All right, Cooper.

52:47.650 --> 52:49.452
Now, listen to me.

52:49.752 --> 52:52.187
When you pick up this hammer,

52:52.287 --> 52:56.657
you pick it up real, real slow.

52:58.094 --> 53:00.796
It's not about
what you're gonna do with it.

53:01.129 --> 53:03.384
It's what they think
you're gonna do with it.

53:07.570 --> 53:11.406
- Yes, Dad.
- Let the camera do the rest of it.

53:11.506 --> 53:13.842
All right, let's go get her.

53:31.092 --> 53:32.828
Please stop.

53:41.404 --> 53:43.905
Please don't hurt me.

53:44.205 --> 53:45.974
Please don't...

53:51.180 --> 53:54.016
Please. No.

54:09.431 --> 54:12.266
<i>This is your proof of life.</i>

54:39.194 --> 54:41.614
<i>As you can see,</i>

54:41.714 --> 54:44.733
<i>your daughter has not been harmed.</i>

54:47.969 --> 54:49.771
<i>Yet.</i>

55:01.249 --> 55:04.006
<i>If you do not do as you're instructed...</i>

55:05.887 --> 55:09.302
<i>you will never see her alive...</i>

55:09.402 --> 55:11.288
<i>again.</i>

55:32.881 --> 55:34.683
Hey.

55:36.652 --> 55:40.723
You did good, boy. You did real good.

55:45.126 --> 55:47.196
We done?

55:47.446 --> 55:49.664
Don't it look like it?

55:49.764 --> 55:52.133
What about the other girl?

55:52.233 --> 55:54.803
She ain't worth nothig.
We're gonna have to get rid of her.

55:55.003 --> 55:57.372
Why not just ransom her back to that guy?

55:57.472 --> 55:59.675
She's seen too much, son.

55:59.775 --> 56:03.807
Just ask John.
Hell, he's some lowlife trafficker.

56:03.907 --> 56:06.950
Can't pay if you don't need the problems.

56:07.550 --> 56:11.053
Right? We're just taking out the trash.

56:11.153 --> 56:13.641
Doing the world a favor.

56:14.356 --> 56:17.970
What we gotta do is keep
our eye on that prize. Okay?

56:18.070 --> 56:20.460
All right, attaboy.

56:33.809 --> 56:36.461
- Oh, God, John.
- It's all right. You've gotta keep quiet.

56:36.561 --> 56:40.850
There's three now. There's three people here.
I saw the other kids in the rooms.

56:40.950 --> 56:44.562
I'm going back to our house. I'm gonna get
the bolt cutters and I'm gonna get my gun.

56:44.662 --> 56:48.109
Listen to me, this is gonna get really bad.
Really quickly.

56:48.209 --> 56:50.528
- Yeah.
- I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

56:50.628 --> 56:53.294
- I'm not gonna let them hurt you.
- Yeah.

56:53.394 --> 56:56.317
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

58:49.277 --> 58:50.878
Please don't.

59:00.322 --> 59:03.068
Dad, help!

59:03.459 --> 59:05.527
Dad!

59:17.706 --> 59:19.109
Dad!

59:19.909 --> 59:21.666
Help!

59:24.480 --> 59:26.981
Eat that shit!

59:27.081 --> 59:28.949
Fucker!

59:55.411 --> 59:57.713
Where's the fucking gun?

59:57.813 --> 59:59.614
Fuck.

01:00:20.735 --> 01:00:22.538
Fuck.

01:00:27.709 --> 01:00:31.211
Hey, where the hell is your brother?

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.111
You know Cooper.

01:00:34.211 --> 01:00:37.385
Goddamn shame we can't keep her, Dad.

01:00:37.485 --> 01:00:40.522
Yeah, she's a pretty
little thing, ain't she?

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.098
Now, remember, you said I have dibs.

01:00:51.198 --> 01:00:52.968
You do.

01:00:53.268 --> 01:00:55.604
Do me a favor, though.

01:00:55.704 --> 01:01:01.242
Don't tear her up too bad. I'm thinking
I might like a poke at this little one.

01:01:01.342 --> 01:01:04.745
Bet you'd enjoy that,
wouldn't you, princess?

01:01:06.615 --> 01:01:08.484
Sweet.

01:01:08.884 --> 01:01:12.252
Dress her up. Something nice.

01:01:16.325 --> 01:01:18.243
Don't mind him.

01:01:27.835 --> 01:01:31.140
No! No! Wait! Please!

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.644
Shut the fuck up! I'm here to help you.

01:01:35.744 --> 01:01:39.847
I found your friend Sarah,
and I've got a girl upstairs, okay?

01:01:39.947 --> 01:01:43.285
- I need your help.
- I'm sorry, I can't walk or run.

01:01:43.385 --> 01:01:45.475
I tried to run. I'm sorry.

01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:49.697
I can't walk. No, wait! Wait!
Where are you going? No, don't leave me!

01:01:49.797 --> 01:01:52.260
Shut the fuck up.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.664
I'm gonna cut this chain.
I do not want you to move.

01:01:55.764 --> 01:01:58.399
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:02:02.837 --> 01:02:05.540
- Tell me that you can move on your own.
- Yeah, I'm okay, I can move.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.711
Listen. I found your friend.
He's down the hall.

01:02:08.811 --> 01:02:11.580
He's hurt pretty badly
and he can't move on his own.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:14.783
I need you to dial in right now.

01:02:14.883 --> 01:02:19.121
Do you understand me?
My girl is upstairs and I need your help.

01:02:19.221 --> 01:02:21.495
- Can I count on you?
- Yes.

01:03:05.467 --> 01:03:08.502
- Can you throw?
- Yeah.

01:03:10.204 --> 01:03:12.106
Take this.

01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:14.530
I want you to throw the rock
at that house.

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:17.065
And hit it hard. They're gonna come out.

01:03:17.165 --> 01:03:21.363
So as soon as you throw that, you take him,
you go to my truck right over there,

01:03:21.463 --> 01:03:25.740
start it up, but do not turn
the lights on, all right?

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.543
- You wait for me there.
- Okay.

01:03:28.643 --> 01:03:31.480
Listen, do not lose those keys.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.716
Count to 100, then throw the rock.

01:03:37.452 --> 01:03:39.620
Now, I got this...

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.656
off an Iowa girl.

01:03:44.992 --> 01:03:47.559
They paid a lot of money to get her back.

01:03:53.135 --> 01:03:57.205
You can tell how much money folks got
when they get the girl something like this.

01:04:03.078 --> 01:04:06.814
You know, little girls generally
don't make it on the good wall.

01:04:08.416 --> 01:04:10.450
No, ma'am.

01:04:10.919 --> 01:04:13.955
Generally, they're too strung out.

01:04:14.355 --> 01:04:16.489
Too easy to get.

01:04:18.426 --> 01:04:20.929
But you are a special little bird.

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:24.233
Unique.

01:04:24.533 --> 01:04:27.102
Prettiest goddamn girl I've ever seen.

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:30.739
You're gonna do just right by us.

01:04:33.474 --> 01:04:35.142
Please...

01:04:37.443 --> 01:04:40.346
I was beginning to think you didn't speak.

01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:48.823
You wanna look nice and pretty
for your close-up, don't you?

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:51.591
Don't you?

01:04:55.898 --> 01:04:58.665
Zip it up. Something's going on.

01:05:05.372 --> 01:05:07.175
Cooper!

01:05:09.593 --> 01:05:12.379
Coop! Cooper!

01:05:14.282 --> 01:05:16.184
Come on.

01:05:22.791 --> 01:05:24.326
Cooper!

01:05:32.333 --> 01:05:34.370
Cooper!

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:37.304
- Cooper!
- Coop!

01:05:39.974 --> 01:05:41.472
Dad!

01:05:58.327 --> 01:06:00.028
He's fucking dead!

01:06:40.035 --> 01:06:42.537
- I'm not leaving!
- Come on!

01:06:42.637 --> 01:06:45.407
- Go! Get up!
- Keys. Come on.

01:07:00.321 --> 01:07:02.925
- Shit! Shit!
- Get in the truck!

01:07:03.025 --> 01:07:05.165
Start the fucking truck!

01:07:05.265 --> 01:07:07.095
Shit! Hold on.

01:07:07.195 --> 01:07:10.476
- Where you going, John?
- It's not what you think. They got guns.

01:07:10.856 --> 01:07:13.901
- What?
- They're coming with guns!

01:07:30.117 --> 01:07:32.072
Here.

01:07:37.292 --> 01:07:39.402
- Get in the car! Get in the car!
- Guille!

01:07:39.502 --> 01:07:42.028
He's dead. Go! Get in the car!

01:07:43.931 --> 01:07:45.767
- Oh, my God!
- Get in the car!

01:07:45.867 --> 01:07:47.569
Come on!

01:07:50.204 --> 01:07:52.739
Go, go, go, go!

01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:56.111
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:07:56.911 --> 01:08:01.165
Go, go, go! Keep your heads down.
Heads down!

01:08:02.115 --> 01:08:04.855
Ain't nobody gonna take me!

01:08:04.955 --> 01:08:07.087
Come on, motherfuckers!

01:08:07.187 --> 01:08:08.889
Shit!

01:08:10.092 --> 01:08:12.373
John, I'm gonna need you...

01:09:26.167 --> 01:09:28.767
- Fuck!
- Don't fucking move!

01:09:31.109 --> 01:09:33.374
- John!
- Rosie!

01:10:05.839 --> 01:10:08.077
That motherfucker!

01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:12.780
Fuck! Fucker!

01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:15.616
I knew you were trouble, Johnny.

01:10:16.751 --> 01:10:19.988
The Service puts a certain
moral code in me.

01:10:20.088 --> 01:10:22.877
Just like it puts
a certain moral code in you.

01:10:23.857 --> 01:10:25.996
You know, I just wanted to kill you.

01:10:26.526 --> 01:10:28.864
This is ugly country.

01:10:28.964 --> 01:10:31.480
People do ugly things.

01:10:36.538 --> 01:10:39.426
Ain't it like that sometimes?

01:10:41.676 --> 01:10:43.078
Get the fuck up!

01:10:43.178 --> 01:10:46.214
You understand what it means
to take a life.

01:10:49.084 --> 01:10:51.819
They don't understand
what it means to give it.

01:10:51.919 --> 01:10:53.721
Fuck you!

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:56.276
Goddamn it!

01:10:59.494 --> 01:11:01.629
This is old country, Johnny.

01:11:10.604 --> 01:11:13.206
No place for weakness.

01:11:17.144 --> 01:11:18.846
Motherfuckers.

01:11:18.946 --> 01:11:21.782
Cooper didn't do shit to you.

01:11:21.882 --> 01:11:24.585
You fucking murderers!

01:11:24.685 --> 01:11:27.254
Takes someone like me to see that.

01:11:27.354 --> 01:11:31.924
To see that some people ain't even meant
to be born in the first place.

01:11:55.717 --> 01:11:57.420
Fuck.

01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.530
No, no, don't you fucking die!
Don't you fucking die!

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:03.934
You don't get to fucking die!

01:12:17.271 --> 01:12:19.976
Let me the fuck out of here!

01:12:32.786 --> 01:12:35.522
No, no, no. Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:12:35.622 --> 01:12:39.447
No, no, no. Fuck you! Fuck!

01:12:39.727 --> 01:12:41.229
Fuck!

01:12:55.109 --> 01:12:57.812
Am I pretty now, motherfucker?

01:12:57.912 --> 01:13:00.417
Prettiest thing you ever saw?

01:13:02.484 --> 01:13:07.654
You know, it's always the ones
that look nice with the sick minds.

01:13:15.029 --> 01:13:17.231
Don't move. Don't move!

01:13:17.331 --> 01:13:21.269
- You're sadistic.
- Hit her again! Do it!

01:13:21.369 --> 01:13:23.471
Let us go or I'll fucking shoot you!

01:13:23.571 --> 01:13:26.173
Do it here! Do it!

01:13:34.613 --> 01:13:36.916
Let's go, baby.

01:13:37.318 --> 01:13:39.287
Do not...

01:13:39.387 --> 01:13:40.954
point...

01:13:41.054 --> 01:13:44.344
a gun if you don't know
what the hell you're doing!

01:13:50.997 --> 01:13:52.799
Let her go!

01:14:17.724 --> 01:14:20.326
He's locked us in.

01:14:21.913 --> 01:14:23.680
What?

01:14:30.705 --> 01:14:33.807
- Move back. Back! Back!
- Come on, come on.

01:14:34.487 --> 01:14:36.276
John!

01:14:42.216 --> 01:14:45.619
He's coming back up the stairs. Get her down
there. Get her down the fucking hole! Go!

01:14:45.719 --> 01:14:47.475
Come on.

01:15:19.687 --> 01:15:22.622
Okay. Okay.

01:15:26.628 --> 01:15:28.461
Fuck!

01:16:31.892 --> 01:16:34.495
You think this ends with me?

01:16:34.995 --> 01:16:37.664
I'm just a middleman.

01:16:39.533 --> 01:16:42.103
Just like you, John.

01:16:48.241 --> 01:16:50.247
That's right.

01:16:50.578 --> 01:16:52.717
That's right.

01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:55.049
They all know who you are.

01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:56.950
And they're coming.

01:16:57.050 --> 01:16:59.687
Nobody gets away.

01:17:03.224 --> 01:17:06.327
Now, why don't you to be
a good little soldier,

01:17:06.427 --> 01:17:08.390
John boy...

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:11.563
and put the fucking gun do...

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:50.006
