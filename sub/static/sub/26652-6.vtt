00:13.361 --> 00:14.971

- It just looks like her.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.321
- She's a shape-shifter.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.714

I mean, I dig it,

10:21.316 --> 10:22.665
- Well, I'm not your
disco-loving ex, mate.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.668
- Meet the newest member
of our team,

10:25.712 --> 10:26.800
Charlie.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.672
- Charlie here
is a shape-shifter.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.587
Except she can no longer
shape-shift.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.110
It's actually
a pretty crazy story.

10:33.154 --> 10:34.808
- Let me guess:
she turned into Amaya

10:34.851 --> 10:36.636
and conned you
into not sending her to hell

10:36.679 --> 10:37.680
and Constantine put
a spell on her

10:37.724 --> 10:38.812
and now she's stuck like this?

10:38.855 --> 10:39.900

10:39.943 --> 10:42.250
weirdly accurate, yeah.
- Yeah.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.860
- I guess it's not
such a crazy story.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.122

10:45.166 --> 10:47.037
I told my dad you guys
were good at your jobs,

10:47.081 --> 10:49.387
and now you're adopting
some magical creature

10:49.431 --> 10:50.867
who's pretending to be Amaya?

10:50.911 --> 10:52.521

to be anyone.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.044
- That said,

10:54.088 --> 10:55.959
Hank's already looking for ways
to slash our funding,

10:56.003 --> 10:57.831
so maybe it's not
the worst idea

10:57.874 --> 10:59.746
to fake it for one mission.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.531
- You want me to pretend
to be this wanker's ex?

11:02.574 --> 11:03.837
- What--

11:03.880 --> 11:05.708
- Sounds like classic
Legends hijinks to me.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.537
- We can't let Hank know that
we're harboring a fugitive.

11:08.580 --> 11:09.973
We just need to show him
one mission,

11:10.017 --> 11:14.891
send him on his way
before anything can go wrong.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.806

it wasn't the best idea

11:16.850 --> 11:18.939
to leave him with those three.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.897

you hear that?

11:36.826 --> 11:38.523

on the magic-o-meter.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.874
- Oh, where in history
are we gonna end up next?

11:40.917 --> 11:43.703
The Wild West,

11:43.746 --> 11:46.923

11:46.967 --> 11:49.360
Paris in the Roaring Twenties?

11:52.015 --> 11:53.625

11:53.669 --> 11:56.106

magic-o-meter of yours works.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.194
- Oh, well--

11:57.238 --> 11:58.935
- Thingy goes beep,
and we kick ass.

11:58.979 --> 12:02.025
- Meaning we investigate
each time period.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.680
- We find the creature.
- We bring it to the Bureau.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.117
- And hopefully learn some
life lessons along the way.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.467
- And it takes six of you
to do that?

12:09.511 --> 12:12.035
- Seven if you count Amaya.
- Eight if you count me.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.211
- Sounds a little inefficient.

12:14.255 --> 12:19.826
- Which is why we separate
into two very important teams.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.742
Zee, John, Ray, and Amaya

12:22.785 --> 12:23.786

17:17.949 --> 17:20.387

17:24.956 --> 17:26.175

17:26.219 --> 17:27.742

17:27.785 --> 17:29.222

17:39.275 --> 17:41.843

but we are here

17:41.886 --> 17:43.149

17:43.192 --> 17:44.280
- Of course,

17:44.324 --> 17:45.977
but I know we sure as hell
aren't gonna

17:46.021 --> 17:49.633
find out what it is by studying
some finger paintings.

17:50.547 --> 17:53.289
- We gotta go back to the ship
to figure out what we're doing.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.856
That's the way we do things,
right?

17:54.899 --> 17:59.078
- Yes, when the mission isn't
also showing Hank a good time.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.645
I'm sorry.

18:01.689 --> 18:02.951
You know, I thought
this would be good

18:02.994 --> 18:04.692
for the both of us, but...

18:04.735 --> 18:06.259
Hank is at his happiest

18:06.302 --> 18:07.999
when he's telling me
what I'm doing wrong,

18:08.043 --> 18:09.262
so...

18:09.305 --> 18:10.176
Mission accomplished.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.742
- Aw, cheer up, bud.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.180
You are right, so Rory and I,

18:14.223 --> 18:15.529
we will keep an eye on Hank,

18:15.572 --> 18:17.357
let him have a few laughs
with Hemingway

18:17.400 --> 18:20.186
while you go figure out
what this thing is.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.405
We bag the creature,
we keep our jobs.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.233
- Okay.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.279
- Whoa, where are you
all going?

18:26.322 --> 18:28.019
- Henry here told me
of a creature

18:28.063 --> 18:29.151
hiding in the Catacombs.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.460
- Therefore we hunt.
- Let's go get our monster.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.592
- Nate's right. We have no idea
what this thing is.

18:35.636 --> 18:38.117
- A man hunts not to learn
about his prey

18:38.160 --> 18:39.640
but to learn about himself.

18:39.683 --> 18:42.730
- We need to regroup with
the team and get some backup.

18:42.773 --> 18:45.167
- What better backup
than Hemingway?

18:45.211 --> 18:46.777
I'm finally starting
to understand

29:24.763 --> 29:27.940

our "D&D" miniatures?

29:59.145 --> 30:00.624
- No, I didn't let him
touch Cyndra,

30:00.668 --> 30:01.843
Lord of the Dark Elves.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.802
- You guys "D&D"

30:03.845 --> 30:06.021
- Son, why are you holding
a tiny guitar,

30:06.065 --> 30:07.849
or do I even want to know?

30:07.893 --> 30:09.198
- Oh, this--this is a lute.

30:09.242 --> 30:11.200
Someone say loot?

30:11.244 --> 30:13.115
- This is what we're gonna use
to put the Minotaur to sleep.

30:13.159 --> 30:14.856
- I thought you said
that was loot.

30:14.900 --> 30:15.988
- I don't understand.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.511

it is more of a lyre.

30:17.554 --> 30:18.947

30:23.691 --> 30:25.780
You think you can destroy it
with a lute?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.303
- Well,
in the hands of a master,

30:27.347 --> 30:29.740
a lute is a formidable weapon.
Just look at Sting, mate.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.090

but there's a change

30:31.133 --> 30:32.526

30:32.569 --> 30:34.006

is imminent.

30:34.049 --> 30:35.485
There will be no survivors.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.792

tracking Hemingway's scent.

I've ever tried to teach you.

- Softball team.

40:42.527 --> 40:43.615
- Oh, no,
only electronic sports.

40:43.658 --> 40:45.051
- Piñata Fridays.

40:45.094 --> 40:47.662
- How many times do I have
to say no to that?

40:47.706 --> 40:48.924
- Unionizing.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.361
- Ooh, don't let Hank
hear you say that.

40:51.405 --> 40:53.625
- You know, it's still weird
not having you around.

40:53.668 --> 40:54.974
- Mm-hmm.

40:55.017 --> 40:56.628
- Aw, man, I'll always be
right there, big guy,

40:56.671 --> 40:58.630
in that giant heart of yours.
- Aw.

40:58.673 --> 41:00.414
- And I'll be at the Bureau,

41:00.458 --> 41:02.372
so you guys can literally
stop by whenever you want.

41:02.416 --> 41:04.113
- Mm.

41:04.157 --> 41:06.202
But, you know, before I go,

41:06.246 --> 41:07.769
I do want to say
one thing.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.771
When I first stepped
onto this ship,

41:09.815 --> 41:12.339
I was, you know,
trying to get away from

41:12.382 --> 41:13.645
all my baggage back home,

41:13.688 --> 41:16.082
and I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

41:16.125 --> 41:17.649
Hemingway once wrote,

41:17.692 --> 41:19.085
"Can't get away from yourself

41:19.128 --> 41:21.609
by moving from
one place to another."

41:21.653 --> 41:22.741
- Mm.
- And thanks to you guys,

41:22.784 --> 41:24.220
I don't have to run anymore.

41:24.264 --> 41:25.657
Being here with you all
has turned me

41:25.700 --> 41:26.919
into the man I need to be,

41:26.962 --> 41:30.966
and, uh, this place is special.

41:31.010 --> 41:33.316
And you never know
when it's gonna be over.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.710
So I say, Legends,

41:35.754 --> 41:38.104
enjoy the ride while it lasts.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.322
- Hear, hear.

41:39.366 --> 41:40.585
Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:40.628 --> 41:43.501
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers, cheers.

41:43.544 --> 41:46.199
- Uh, you'll find
your place here.

41:46.242 --> 41:47.243
I know I did.

41:50.290 --> 41:53.249
♪

42:15.576 --> 42:17.099
- Greg, move your head.
