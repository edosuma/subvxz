WEBVTT

00:04.422 --> 00:06.750
Hank, if your neck is
so sore all the time,

00:06.780 --> 00:09.280
why don't you just buy a new mattress?

00:09.320 --> 00:10.630
Who am I, Warren Buffet?

00:10.660 --> 00:11.980
I'm on a fixed income.

00:11.990 --> 00:15.720
I can't just be buying a new
mattress every 25 years.

00:15.723 --> 00:18.380
Yeah, I get all my
mattresses from the street.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.370
Sometimes they even come
with a free raccoon.

00:21.390 --> 00:23.640
All right, Hank, I'm just
gonna very gently...

00:23.660 --> 00:24.809
Okay, now... Whoa!

00:24.810 --> 00:26.640
Oh! You demon!

00:26.680 --> 00:29.689
Wait a minute. Wow. You fixed it.

00:29.690 --> 00:31.080
- Oh.
- Nice work, demon.

00:31.090 --> 00:32.180
Mm.

00:32.759 --> 00:33.980
Well, Sid.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.630
- Ah.
- I'm off to Milan

00:35.660 --> 00:37.279
for a week... again.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.940
Listen, I have some rather fickle ficus.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.260
You sure you can handle watering
my plants while I'm gone?

00:44.340 --> 00:46.960
I know you poors don't like to work.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.760
You know it.

00:48.790 --> 00:51.091
Everybody, this is Edie.

00:51.092 --> 00:54.129
She lives over in Shady Meadows West,

00:54.130 --> 00:56.360
where the rich people live.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.259
I wandered over there once,

00:58.260 --> 01:01.420
and Edie was kind enough
to escort me out.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.040
Here's the key.

01:03.060 --> 01:06.059
Be sure to remove your shoes on the rug.

01:06.060 --> 01:09.600
And I must insist you
sit when you urinate.

01:09.620 --> 01:12.300
Ooh, do we stand when we do number two?

01:12.330 --> 01:15.489
Oh, forget I said that.

01:15.490 --> 01:17.760
Uh, uh, don't you worry.

01:17.770 --> 01:21.900
I'm going to treat your fickle
fici as if they were my own.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.780
See that you do.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.680
Toodily oodily.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.630
Gee, I hope they let
her through security

01:29.640 --> 01:31.660
with that stick up her butt.

01:31.690 --> 01:34.900
Sid, why would you do anything
for that snobby woman?

01:35.900 --> 01:38.930
Any other stupid questions, stupid?

01:41.640 --> 01:43.469
Sorry.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.480
Living the high life is getting to me.

01:47.980 --> 01:50.060
Oh, it's plastic.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

02:14.500 --> 02:17.089
Wow. So this is how
the other half lives.

02:17.090 --> 02:19.980
Two bed, two bath. Washer, dryer.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.620
Yeah. Now I don't have to get glared at

02:22.640 --> 02:25.980
by Meredith McDougle
in the laundry room.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.979
The woman is there every day,

02:27.980 --> 02:29.860
yet her clothes are always dirty.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.360
What are you washing, Meredith?!

02:32.450 --> 02:35.200
Ooh-wee!

02:35.220 --> 02:39.079
Ooh, this massage chair
is working my neck out.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.359
And my butt!

02:40.360 --> 02:42.640
Oh! Thattagirl!

02:42.680 --> 02:44.920
Work that booty.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.960
Look at that crappy apartment down there

02:47.980 --> 02:50.039
with the two-cent window treatments.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.660
What... what kind of
an animal lives there?

02:52.700 --> 02:54.460
Oh.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.839
I think that's actually my place.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.880
This kitchen is great. I love to cook.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.560
Reminds me of my days as
a chef on a wagon train.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.960
Frontierland at Disney World.

03:06.940 --> 03:08.099
Cookie, anyone?

03:08.100 --> 03:09.560
Yeah, sure.

03:09.570 --> 03:11.539
- Wow.
- This is the life.

03:11.540 --> 03:12.550
Mmm.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.940
Holy crap, Charlie.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.159
These are really good.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.029
- I had no idea you bake.
- Thanks.

03:18.030 --> 03:22.080
Yeah, I like to get stoned and
just let my creativity run wild.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.690
Sometimes it leads to baking,

03:23.700 --> 03:26.380
and sometimes it leads to, uh...

03:27.720 --> 03:30.380
What were we talking about?

03:30.460 --> 03:32.419
Okay. Fast.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.379
Oh, fast.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.060
Wait a minute. I don't think I
feel comfortable with this.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.799
Hold up.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.920
Yes, I do.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.059
If this ever goes to trial,

03:45.060 --> 03:47.520
I'm a witness for the chair.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.840
You know what, Charlie? You
could make some decent money

03:49.850 --> 03:51.550
- selling these cookies.
- Oh, Charlie,

03:51.560 --> 03:53.769
you'd be adorable selling cookies.

03:53.770 --> 03:56.700
Like a stoned, wrinkly Girl Scout.

03:56.720 --> 04:00.460
What am I saying? That
would be terrifying.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.990
Yeah, I appreciate it, guys, but no.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.326
No, cooking is just a hobby I picked up

04:05.327 --> 04:07.788
when I retired, like, uh...

04:09.840 --> 04:12.040
Like, what-what are we talking about?

04:12.140 --> 04:15.090
Ben and Jerry started
as a fun hobby, too,

04:15.100 --> 04:16.108
and look at them now.

04:16.110 --> 04:18.760
Yeah, I don't care about
your other friends.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.879
You guys like this place, right?

04:21.880 --> 04:24.380
It's only $1,000 a month more.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.199
I mean, if we could
turn Charlie's Cookies

04:26.200 --> 04:28.549
into a real business...
which I know how to do...

04:28.550 --> 04:31.680
we could all be living
in Shady Meadows West.

04:31.700 --> 04:35.024
I mean, isn't this what we want
our retirement to look like?

04:35.025 --> 04:37.699
I've always wanted to be a snob.

04:37.700 --> 04:41.360
I so seldom get to look down on people.

04:41.370 --> 04:44.559
I could use the spare money
to buy a nice mattress.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.660
I mean, if I keep lying on mine,

04:46.700 --> 04:48.578
I won't be able to turn
my neck to the left.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.205
How am I gonna watch tennis?

04:50.206 --> 04:52.059
I'll be all like...

04:55.870 --> 04:58.660
What do you say, Charlie?
They're your cookies.

04:58.700 --> 05:02.240
Well, you know, we didn't retire
to retire from retirement.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.700
If we retired to make
money for our retirement,

05:04.720 --> 05:06.596
then you're not retiring
from your retirement.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.200
You have to retire your retirement

05:08.220 --> 05:11.240
to retire, and that's tiring.

05:11.280 --> 05:14.120
Look, Charlie, all you have to do

05:14.140 --> 05:15.770
is get baked and bake.

05:15.773 --> 05:18.273
I have always dreamed of
running my own business.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.120
I will handle everything else.

05:20.140 --> 05:21.480
I don't think so.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.613
Your weed would be a business write-off.

05:23.614 --> 05:24.699
I'm in.

05:30.760 --> 05:34.980
Now, if you will turn to
page 14 in your packets,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.110
you will see that our marginal
costs are gonna start

05:38.120 --> 05:40.060
- to decline right here...
- As will our lives

05:40.080 --> 05:43.090
if you don't stop talking!

05:43.820 --> 05:46.240
Seriously, Margaret, you
said this would be fun.

05:46.260 --> 05:50.260
I have never had less fun in
my life, and I was a P.O.W.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.219
At least there, they played music.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.460
Okay, guys, we're putting
in a little work now

05:55.480 --> 05:57.659
so that we can have a lot of fun later.

05:57.660 --> 05:59.520
We need a professional oven like Edie's

05:59.550 --> 06:00.719
if we're gonna make enough cookies

06:00.720 --> 06:02.139
to get this company off the ground,

06:02.140 --> 06:03.149
and we only have a week

06:03.150 --> 06:04.590
before she gets back home.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.850
Margaret, here's where you went wrong.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.660
See, you made pie charts

06:10.680 --> 06:12.399
when you should've made cookie charts

06:12.400 --> 06:13.890
made out of real cookies.

06:13.910 --> 06:16.869
That way, when you're talking,
we can be eating bites

06:16.870 --> 06:19.619
that represent the profits and losses.

06:19.620 --> 06:21.579
Get in there, Hank. Save her.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.549
Oh, looks like I need to come
in here and take charge.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.549
All right, so, uh, first of
all, you don't run a business

06:27.550 --> 06:30.100
with all this old nerd stuff.
You got to use your gut.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.500
Mm. Well, you definitely have
me beat in the gut department.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.240
What do you know about business?

06:35.280 --> 06:38.180
You were a meter reader
for the gas company.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.780
Margaret, I was in sales.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.149
How is reading meters sales?

06:42.150 --> 06:43.699
Well, I had to sell the idea

06:43.700 --> 06:45.820
of a black man coming on
white folks' property.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.720
If I can sell that, cookies
will be a piece of cake.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.699
Ooh, we should sell cake.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.239
And doughnuts, too!

06:52.240 --> 06:54.100
- And wallets.
- What?

06:54.120 --> 06:57.500
No. No, Charlie's Cookies
should only be selling cookies.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.400
Look, you guys, I have been
through this whole thing before.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.020
My ex-husband Kenny and I ran

07:02.040 --> 07:04.460
a seafood distribution
company for years.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.349
And that applies to cakes,

07:06.350 --> 07:10.100
doughnuts and wallets how?

07:10.190 --> 07:12.700
He didn't listen to me, either,

07:12.720 --> 07:14.899
and that's why our company
crashed and burned.

07:14.900 --> 07:18.560
Wasn't for him, I'd be the
shrimp queen of Pensacola.

07:18.580 --> 07:20.720
While we're bringing
up painful memories,

07:20.760 --> 07:24.480
"shrimp queen" is really
triggering for me.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.580
Anyway, I am not gonna
watch another company fail

07:29.600 --> 07:31.720
just because a man is
too stubborn to listen.

07:31.740 --> 07:33.920
I will be running Charlie's Cookies.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.839
So, you get to be in charge just
'cause you married a moron?

07:36.840 --> 07:38.640
What kind of sense does that make?

07:40.010 --> 07:43.180
It's called "Charlie's Cookies."

07:43.220 --> 07:45.320
Okay, so I think it's pretty obvious

07:45.340 --> 07:47.850
who should be running it. Hank.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.360
Can't argue with that logic.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.560
You guys want extra money, right?

07:53.580 --> 07:55.109
Hank, you want that new mattress.

07:55.110 --> 07:56.989
Sid, you want the high life.

07:56.990 --> 07:59.560
Charlie, we know you want the high life.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.520
I'm the one that can lead us
down that path to success.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.719
Now, I know the charts and the graphs...

08:03.720 --> 08:06.940
Oh, she's boring us
again! I vote for Hank!

08:07.000 --> 08:08.780
- Me, too.
- Guys...

08:08.800 --> 08:10.280
How about you, Margaret?
What's your vote?

08:10.300 --> 08:13.500
Never mind! Doesn't
matter! Hank's in charge.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.879
First order of business:
let's go swimming.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.220
All right!

08:23.760 --> 08:26.769
1,000 cookies by Friday.

08:26.770 --> 08:29.440
Absolutely, no problem.
We can make that happen.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.260
Thank you.

08:31.290 --> 08:34.460
You guys, I just landed a huge order.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.489
It's a big resort in Sedona.

08:36.490 --> 08:37.818
Could we now please admit

08:37.820 --> 08:40.000
that I am the one who
should be in charge?

08:40.049 --> 08:41.969
Nope. But listen to this.

08:41.970 --> 08:45.080
Charlie's got an idea for
a chocolate chip cookie

08:45.100 --> 08:48.720
where all the chips are
little bitty cookies.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.940
We're gonna be so frigging rich.

08:55.020 --> 08:57.019
Oh, you know what?

08:57.020 --> 08:58.519
Forget about a mattress.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.020
I'm gonna buy a waterbed,

09:00.040 --> 09:02.220
and I'm gonna fill it full of champagne.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.819
Hank, don't be spending
money before you got it.

09:04.820 --> 09:07.340
That's just about the most
foolish thing you can do.

09:07.370 --> 09:10.580
Guess who's been spending
their balls off.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.560
Wha... ?

09:13.580 --> 09:16.180
Where are the groceries
I asked you to buy?

09:16.200 --> 09:18.629
And why are you dressed
like a Build-A-Bear?

09:18.630 --> 09:21.940
Why are you dressed like the
manager at a pumpkin patch?

09:23.200 --> 09:26.660
We can both be mean, Margaret.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.259
Who wears a fur in Arizona?

09:29.260 --> 09:31.480
If I'm gonna live in Shady Meadows West,

09:31.540 --> 09:33.290
I got to look the part.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.240
What part is that? The oldest Ewok?

09:37.300 --> 09:39.200
How did you afford all of this?

09:39.220 --> 09:42.729
I set us up a corporate
credit card, silly.

09:42.730 --> 09:44.359
The company pays for it.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.120
We are the company.

09:47.820 --> 09:50.520
We have got to hustle if
we're gonna fill this order

09:50.550 --> 09:52.039
before Edie gets home.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.020
This is a golden opportunity, guys.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.260
Come on, let's get to work.

09:55.270 --> 09:57.320
Whoa, Margaret, calm down.

09:57.340 --> 09:59.749
You seem a little emotional.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.480
Don't worry about it. I got this.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.759
You're right. I am being
a little emotional.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.760
Typical woman, right?

10:07.830 --> 10:09.220
You get it.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.879
Oh, she gets it. Yeah.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.320
Hank, as long as you're in charge,

10:13.340 --> 10:16.780
would you mind if I ran out
and got all of the supplies

10:16.800 --> 10:20.849
that Sid forgot and maybe
have myself a... a good cry?

10:20.850 --> 10:22.770
I approve that.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.800
Have fun.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.400
Finally.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.609
Now maybe we can get some work done.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.260
Hank, if we're gonna get
rich off this thing,

10:38.320 --> 10:39.720
we need a jingle.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.160
I'm thinking something like...

10:41.190 --> 10:42.689
♪ Lookee, lookee ♪

10:42.690 --> 10:44.949
♪ Charlie's got a cookie. ♪

10:44.950 --> 10:47.409
All right, sing that song again.
Let me put some stank on it.

10:47.410 --> 10:49.329
♪ Lookee, lookee ♪

10:49.330 --> 10:51.579
♪ Charlie's got a cookie ♪

10:51.580 --> 10:53.409
♪ Lookee, lookee ♪

10:53.410 --> 10:56.419
♪ Charlie's got a cookie. ♪

10:56.420 --> 10:58.600
- Well, that's done.
- Mm.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.760
That's my boss.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.049
Hey, Charlie.

11:09.050 --> 11:10.889
I'm glad you're alone.

11:10.890 --> 11:13.940
Aren't we all really,
at the end of the day?

11:14.890 --> 11:17.399
Yeah, things got a little
heated there earlier,

11:17.400 --> 11:20.300
so, uh, I brought over a
little peace offering.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.819
Ooh.

11:21.820 --> 11:25.660
This is a strain called
"Nipple of the Gods."

11:25.690 --> 11:28.320
It is grown just outside of Humboldt.

11:28.340 --> 11:31.480
I don't need the whole story,
J.K. Rowling. Just spark it up.

11:35.620 --> 11:36.930
♪ Lookee, lookee ♪

11:36.940 --> 11:39.129
♪ Charlie's got a cookie ♪

11:39.130 --> 11:42.630
♪ Lookee, lookee,
Charlie's got a cookie. ♪

11:42.640 --> 11:44.419
That's the best one yet.

11:44.420 --> 11:47.840
I think that four-hour rehearsal
we had today really helped.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.469
I've just got to quadruple-check.

11:50.470 --> 11:52.780
It's a "no" on my choreography?

11:52.800 --> 11:53.820
Yeah.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.620
Wait a minute. What is going on here?

11:58.640 --> 12:01.620
- Every table is eating our cookies.
- Wow.

12:01.630 --> 12:03.620
Uh, hey, baby, where'd
you get these from?

12:03.650 --> 12:07.020
Oh. A red-haired woman sold those to us,

12:07.040 --> 12:08.679
and Susan wouldn't buy any,

12:08.680 --> 12:11.409
and she called her the "B" word.

12:11.410 --> 12:14.080
- Margaret.
- Yes, that's it.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.750
That's funny, because when she
came over the other night,

12:16.760 --> 12:18.880
- she didn't mention anything about this.
- Wait. Hold up.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.500
- She came to see you?
- Yeah, it was fun.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.160
She got me really stoned,

12:23.180 --> 12:24.879
and she brought out
these legal documents

12:24.880 --> 12:27.469
and challenged me to a
signature contest, and I...

12:27.470 --> 12:30.000
- Oh, geez.
- Margaret.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.940
But who won the contest?

12:35.040 --> 12:37.639
Margaret!

12:37.640 --> 12:39.980
Margaret, open up the door right now!

12:41.160 --> 12:42.480
Everything okay, Hank?

12:42.500 --> 12:45.240
Because you sound really emotional.

12:45.270 --> 12:47.120
What is going on in here?

12:47.140 --> 12:48.630
Well, I'm running a successful business

12:48.640 --> 12:50.409
the way I always wanted to.

12:50.410 --> 12:53.780
Hard-working employees,
breaks to call grandkids,

12:53.800 --> 12:55.789
orders being fulfilled on time,

12:55.790 --> 12:59.980
and a business plan that does
not involve miniature furs.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.290
This is a youth large.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.339
Blah, blah, blah.

13:05.340 --> 13:08.380
This doesn't change the fact
that you stole this business.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.639
I did not steal it. I
bought it fair and square.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.550
How can it be fair when you tricked me?

13:13.600 --> 13:16.240
I did not trick you. You
gave me the recipe.

13:16.260 --> 13:18.390
You said I could buy the
company for a dollar.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.019
I said I didn't have a dollar.

13:20.020 --> 13:22.979
You said, "Good enough."
You gave me the company.

13:22.980 --> 13:24.689
Does sound kind of familiar, Hank.

13:24.690 --> 13:26.539
Yeah, well, screw that.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.489
We gonna find our own cookie buyers.

13:28.490 --> 13:30.859
And I know real fat people, Margaret.

13:30.860 --> 13:33.119
Come on, y'all. Let's
go get some supplies.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.079
Yeah, well, about those supplies.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.290
We don't have any money left.

13:37.320 --> 13:41.800
Somebody maxed out our
company credit card.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.060
It was your boy.

13:44.140 --> 13:47.339
- Damn it, Sid!
- Well, it wasn't just me.

13:47.340 --> 13:50.720
You should see how much
Charlie has blown on weed.

13:50.740 --> 13:54.300
We got somebody on the
payroll named Dank Steve.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.059
You know, I've been biting
my tongue on this all week,

13:57.060 --> 14:00.620
but, uh... he prefers Dank Steven.

14:01.720 --> 14:05.359
You know, guys, I couldn't help
but overhear that you suck,

14:05.360 --> 14:07.189
and you've run your company

14:07.190 --> 14:09.070
into the ground, and you have no money.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.239
- We did not say that we suck.
- Oh, it was implied.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.120
Anyway, I'm looking for some
extra hands in the kitchen

14:15.140 --> 14:17.240
if you're interested in working for me.

14:17.270 --> 14:20.800
Over our dead bodies will
we humiliate ourselves

14:20.820 --> 14:22.789
- by bending the knee to your...
- You know, Hank,

14:22.790 --> 14:25.780
she does sound like she
knows what she's doing.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.899
Yeah, Hank. We all want that
Shady Meadows West life, but...

14:29.900 --> 14:31.550
- Yeah.
- I don't see it happening

14:31.560 --> 14:33.140
with you at the helm.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.089
I'm with Margaret now.

14:35.090 --> 14:36.469
Yeah, me, too.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.000
You bunch of betrayers.

14:38.020 --> 14:40.920
I hope you know this
means war. Cookie war!

14:41.000 --> 14:43.140
Good luck trying to sell
something without a jingle.

14:43.170 --> 14:46.420
Oh, you mean the jingle that
Charlie sold to me? Ladies?

14:46.440 --> 14:48.819
♪ Lookee, lookee ♪

14:48.820 --> 14:50.760
♪ Margaret's got a cookie. ♪

14:50.780 --> 14:53.110
Damn, damn, damn!

14:56.900 --> 14:58.119
Great job, team.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.720
We're gonna have these cookies done

14:59.740 --> 15:01.119
with time to spare.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.300
Sid, you're killing it,

15:02.320 --> 15:04.399
but you need to take that fur coat off,

15:04.400 --> 15:07.959
or else cover your entire
body with a hair net.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.839
Oh, I'll just take it off.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.959
I do not know how Russian prostitutes

15:12.960 --> 15:15.260
get anything done in these.

15:16.820 --> 15:19.219
Guys, we have got a huge problem.

15:19.220 --> 15:20.889
The oven is not working.

15:20.890 --> 15:23.600
That's 'cause I just turned the gas off.

15:23.680 --> 15:28.020
Never mess with a retired
meter reader, baby.

15:28.040 --> 15:31.360
Well, that is pretty stupid,
even for you, Hank.

15:31.380 --> 15:33.660
I will just turn the gas back on.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.200
You don't know how. Ha!

15:35.230 --> 15:37.399
Isn't it just a little valve

15:37.400 --> 15:39.490
that you turn counterclockwise?

15:43.980 --> 15:45.370
Maybe.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.540
But sometimes you need a wrench.

15:48.570 --> 15:50.629
You got a wrench, Margaret?

15:50.630 --> 15:53.040
We could just call 24-hour maintenance.

15:53.060 --> 15:56.240
This is Shady Meadows West.
They actually show up.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.720
Shut up, Sid.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.139
Everybody is turning against me.

16:00.140 --> 16:02.960
I lost the company, I lost my friends.

16:02.990 --> 16:04.119
What is next?

16:04.120 --> 16:05.920
Hank, you can have all of that back

16:05.960 --> 16:07.479
if you will just listen to me.

16:07.480 --> 16:11.189
Well, that sounds like a good
idea... on opposite day!

16:11.190 --> 16:16.150
I will never listen to
anything you have to say.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.850
I am taking this company back.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.159
Oh, you wouldn't know
what to do with it.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.700
You're a meter maid!

16:23.740 --> 16:27.499
Meter man. Meter man.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.680
Oh... Is that supposed to impress me?

16:30.760 --> 16:34.080
Your job was wandering around
neighborhoods in shorts.

16:34.100 --> 16:38.500
Pleated shorts! Pleated dress shorts!

16:38.520 --> 16:40.590
They're the half pants of kings.

16:43.380 --> 16:47.439
Well... so, how you
gonna make cookies now,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.020
now that you don't have any flour?

16:49.040 --> 16:50.650
That is sugar, Hank.

16:50.680 --> 16:54.360
So... now you gonna get ants.

16:54.420 --> 16:57.540
And-and how you gonna
sell all these cookies

16:57.580 --> 16:59.659
if you can't find them?

17:01.280 --> 17:03.280
Oh, I'll save the cookies for...

17:03.300 --> 17:06.020
Ah! Hot, hot, hot, hot tray!

17:07.359 --> 17:08.368
- Oops.
- Oh!

17:08.369 --> 17:09.868
Sorry. My bad.

17:09.869 --> 17:12.628
Oh, you are such a baby!

17:12.630 --> 17:15.459
Would a baby ever do this?

17:18.920 --> 17:22.260
Hey! Look at yourselves.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.219
This was supposed to be fun,

17:24.220 --> 17:26.259
and now you're tearing
at each other's throats.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.889
And for what?

17:28.890 --> 17:32.649
A little extra money?

17:32.650 --> 17:34.979
- You can't enjoy cookies...
- Oh!

17:34.980 --> 17:36.479
... without a little milk!

17:36.480 --> 17:37.729
Stop it!

17:37.730 --> 17:39.219
Stop it!

17:39.220 --> 17:41.819
What the hell is the matter with you?!

17:41.820 --> 17:45.300
I told you how important this
was to me, and you ruined it!

17:45.330 --> 17:47.300
Why?! Why, Hank?

17:47.320 --> 17:49.409
Because I did something you couldn't do?

17:49.410 --> 17:52.460
- What's that, have babies?
- There's that, too!

17:57.780 --> 18:01.720
Can somebody show me how
to turn this thing off?

18:11.320 --> 18:14.180
Boy, she's working
that ball pretty hard.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.859
Should we wait till she
tires out a little?

18:16.860 --> 18:18.779
No, let's get right to it.

18:18.780 --> 18:20.939
Charlie, you go in first.
You've seen combat.

18:20.940 --> 18:23.609
Uh, you don't survive by going in first.

18:23.610 --> 18:25.320
All right.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.949
Hey, girl. How's your day going?

18:28.950 --> 18:31.039
Go away. I'm busy.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.959
Uh, listen,

18:32.960 --> 18:36.200
I'm not very good at
apologies, so, um...

18:36.240 --> 18:38.040
we cool?

18:38.060 --> 18:40.940
What Hank means to say

18:40.960 --> 18:43.660
is that he's sorry. That's
what you mean to say,

18:43.680 --> 18:45.739
Hank, right? I don't want
to put words in your mouth,

18:45.740 --> 18:48.759
but you tell Margaret
you're sorry right now.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.720
I'll say I'm sorry when I'm ready.

18:52.390 --> 18:54.979
All right, I'm ready.

18:54.980 --> 18:58.190
So, um, I'm not good with apologies,

18:58.220 --> 18:59.750
but I was watching that show, uh,

18:59.760 --> 19:00.899
- This Is Us.
- Yeah.

19:00.900 --> 19:04.609
And the black dude on the
show would say, uh...

19:04.610 --> 19:08.419
I can kind of be a jerk when
people tell me what to do.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.409
Especially when they're right.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.619
Well, I-I'm kind of the same way.

19:12.620 --> 19:13.939
Except I'm usually right,

19:13.940 --> 19:16.789
so it's not that big
of a problem for me.

19:16.790 --> 19:18.560
Hey, Tom, don't be petty.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.640
No?

19:22.420 --> 19:25.049
Look, guys...

19:25.050 --> 19:27.000
when I watched my ex-husband

19:27.020 --> 19:28.429
run our business into the ground,

19:28.430 --> 19:31.889
I swore I would never let
a man steamroll me again.

19:31.890 --> 19:35.229
I mean, I love hanging out
with you guys, but I'm...

19:35.230 --> 19:37.059
sick of being condescended to.

19:37.060 --> 19:38.859
I'm sick of being ignored,

19:38.860 --> 19:40.299
- I'm sick of being...
- Margaret...

19:40.300 --> 19:43.240
I'm sick of being interrupted.

19:44.300 --> 19:47.199
It's not the 1950s, you guys.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.240
Times have changed, and
you have to change, too.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.419
I'm not saying you have to
agree with me all the time,

19:52.420 --> 19:54.370
but I need to be heard.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.579
Well, Margaret, you know what they say.

19:56.580 --> 19:59.499
Men are from Mars, and women are from...

19:59.500 --> 20:01.980
Well, my mother was from Philadelphia,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
- but she grew up in a small...
- Charlie. Charlie.

20:04.780 --> 20:07.929
We were stupid to not listen to you.

20:07.930 --> 20:11.600
Yeah, and if your ex didn't
listen to you, he's stupid, too.

20:12.980 --> 20:14.540
You know, if we all pitch in,

20:14.550 --> 20:17.480
it's not too late to
finish that cookie order.

20:19.060 --> 20:20.770
What do you say, boss?
