Er, Henry. Thank you
for coming to the reading.

Ah, no. Well, it was lovely.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.166
Do you... Do you work here?

03:40.250 --> 03:41.541
No. God, no.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.625
No. No, no, no, no. No, no.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.125
I'm... [chuckles]
I'm an author.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.708
That was actually my book
that I was reading.

03:47.791 --> 03:48.791
[chuckles] Oh, my God.
Okay, wait.

03:48.875 --> 03:50.500
You're a writer?
That's... Wow.

-[Henry laughs] Yes.
-Okay. That's amazing.

03:52.583 --> 03:54.458
Yes, well,
it's just the one book.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.375
It's The Sensible Heart,

03:56.458 --> 03:57.750
-it's called.
-Oh, okay.

03:57.833 --> 03:59.083
Yeah. I mean, what's it about?

03:59.166 --> 04:03.791
Well, it's about
a man and a woman.

04:03.916 --> 04:04.916
Oh, okay.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.500
-And, er...
-So, it's a love story?

04:06.916 --> 04:09.250
-Yes. Yes, it is a love story.
-Yeah?

04:09.333 --> 04:12.125
And does it get
a little saucy? [chuckles]

04:12.583 --> 04:13.833
No. No.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.333
Er... No.

04:16.416 --> 04:19.375
Not every story about love
has to be about sex.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.625
You know, someone once wrote

04:20.708 --> 04:23.125
that chastity is the body
in the soul's keeping,

04:23.250 --> 04:24.708
and that's how I feel, so...

04:26.000 --> 04:27.416
Right. Yeah.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
[quietly] What!

04:28.583 --> 04:29.958
-Yeah.
-I mean, is it...

04:30.041 --> 04:32.750
Is it selling well, the book?

-Jill? How's it selling?
-[Jill] Hmm?

04:38.875 --> 04:40.250
I... I think it needs
a little longer on the table.

04:40.333 --> 04:41.666
The sign's not necessary.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.458
[Jill] Henry, the book
came out six months ago.

04:43.541 --> 04:44.666
-Yes?
-Two people bought it,

04:44.750 --> 04:45.833
one of them being you.

04:45.916 --> 04:46.958
And you're still using it

-as a chat-up line.
-I'm...

04:49.208 --> 04:52.291

I'm not trying...

Okay. Well,
you know, I'm gonna...

04:54.916 --> 04:57.583
I'm gonna go. But it was
really nice to meet you.

04:57.666 --> 04:59.375
-You, too.
-And good luck with it.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.916
-Did you want a copy?
-Um, nah, it's fine.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.458
-Want my advice?
-No, not particularly.

05:05.541 --> 05:07.416
Do something else
with your life, Henry.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.708
Get a real job.

05:08.791 --> 05:10.375
Go on dates.
Move on. Stop talking

05:10.458 --> 05:11.625
-about your bloody book.
-[cell phone chimes]

05:12.500 --> 05:13.750
Wow.

05:14.208 --> 05:15.416
[Jill sighs]

05:18.125 --> 05:20.083
-Ooh.
-Now what?

05:20.750 --> 05:23.833
Okay. Well, my publisher,
who I haven't heard

05:23.916 --> 05:25.708
from in a long, long time...

05:25.791 --> 05:27.416
Oh, she dropped you,
didn't she?

05:27.500 --> 05:30.125
No. No, actually, no.

05:30.208 --> 05:32.500
She wants me
to go in and see her now.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.958
Brutal. She's going
to do it in person.

05:37.416 --> 05:38.458
Just take the sign down.

05:38.583 --> 05:39.583
-No.
-Yeah.

05:39.666 --> 05:40.833
-No.
-Please.

05:41.583 --> 05:42.583
It's staying, Henry.

[lively music playing]

06:04.666 --> 06:06.583
Hello? Are you... Are you Jen?

06:07.208 --> 06:08.208
Yeah.

The... The Sensible Heart.

Henry?

06:23.166 --> 06:24.500
-Yes.
-Yes.

06:26.125 --> 06:27.125
Don't move.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.250
Please take a seat.

06:37.416 --> 06:39.750
You look more
like an air traffic controller

06:39.833 --> 06:40.875
than a publisher.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.041
Hilarious.

06:42.125 --> 06:44.291
Well, with all the screens
and whatnot.

06:44.375 --> 06:46.583
Okay. You're Henry Cooper?

06:46.666 --> 06:47.833
-Copper.
-Copper, yes.

06:47.916 --> 06:50.083
-Yes. You sent me a text.
-I did.

06:50.625 --> 06:53.750
-Um, I hope everything's okay.
-Take a look at this.

paint dry instead."

Oh, no, no, no.
That's one of your reviews.

07:02.083 --> 07:04.583
Oh, well, that's just
one person's opinion, so...

07:04.666 --> 07:09.250
Mm, no. There are several
similar reviews, some worse.

07:09.583 --> 07:10.583
Okay.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.291
Take a look at that.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.333
[Henry] Picture of me?

07:17.416 --> 07:19.333
Your book is number one.

07:21.541 --> 07:22.875
Er... Erm...

07:23.000 --> 07:24.041
Er, what?

07:24.125 --> 07:25.833
The Sensible Heart is a hit.

07:25.916 --> 07:29.000
It is number one
in the bestsellers.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.041
[chuckles in disbelief]

07:35.416 --> 07:38.750
[chuckles] Sorry, what?
I can't quite believe this.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.166
Well, believe it, Henry.
The figures don't lie.

07:41.708 --> 07:45.416
I... I mean, I... I knew it.
I knew it. I knew it.

07:45.791 --> 07:46.875
[Henry chuckles]

07:46.958 --> 07:48.958
I knew people in this country
had taste.

07:49.083 --> 07:50.166
It's not this country.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.250
Yeah, no,
because there's something

07:51.333 --> 07:53.166
that I remember
E. M. Forster said.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.208
-He said...
-How about remembering

07:54.333 --> 07:55.333
something I just said?
It's not this country.

07:55.416 --> 07:56.416
It's Mexico.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.958
Your book is a bestseller
in Mexico, Henry.

08:00.916 --> 08:02.041
Felicidades.

Mexican fiction chart,

08:10.875 --> 08:13.541
number one, Henry Cooper.
Copper.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.583
So, my book's Spanish?

08:16.666 --> 08:18.250
When did that happen?
How did that happen?

08:18.333 --> 08:20.291
I don't know how
to explain this to you, Henry.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.000
I think your Mexican publisher
saw that it was in English,

08:23.083 --> 08:24.541
and decided
that would make it harder

08:24.625 --> 08:25.625
for Mexican readers.

08:25.708 --> 08:29.416
So, they had it
translated by, um...

08:29.541 --> 08:32.041
"Translated by
M. F. Rodríguez"?

08:32.125 --> 08:33.291
Yes.

08:35.125 --> 08:37.291
-Well, whoever he is...
-Mm-hmm.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.291
...I hope he's managed
to capture

08:39.375 --> 08:41.250
all the nuances of the story.

08:41.875 --> 08:42.875
Yeah.

I did knock. This... [knocks]

Come on, Grandpa,

09:13.750 --> 09:15.916
I need to clean in here
before taking Diego to school.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.875
You can read your poetry

Come on.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.333
Well, does that mean
people know me there?

09:27.541 --> 09:30.125
The book, yeah.
You, not so much.

09:30.208 --> 09:34.083
Uh, apparently, you have
zero presence on social media.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.708
That has to change if we're
gonna take this global.

09:37.875 --> 09:39.958
Are you not engaging
with followers?

09:40.041 --> 09:42.458
-Engaging? What?
-You are on Facebook?

09:43.125 --> 09:44.166
Twitter?

09:45.625 --> 09:46.625
Instagram?

09:47.041 --> 09:48.500
I have a LinkedIn.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.250
Okay, Henry.

09:52.416 --> 09:54.958
Okay, I'm going to set you up
with some accounts.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.250
Um, people aren't
coming to you,

09:57.333 --> 09:58.541
so you have to go to them.

09:59.041 --> 10:01.708
-It's all about engagement.
-I'm a... I'm a writer.

10:01.791 --> 10:03.791
Yeah, a writer who needs
to get his ass to Mexico

10:03.875 --> 10:06.041
and start plugging that book
in person and online.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.916
You do this right, this could
be just the start for you.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.041
[Henry] But...

10:11.625 --> 10:14.125
Henry, do you want
to pay your rent?

10:14.666 --> 10:15.666
Yes.

10:15.750 --> 10:16.833
Then let's build the hype

10:16.916 --> 10:18.708
till they're begging you
for a sequel.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.208
Go make us some
real money off this thing.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.291
Okay, that's your schedule
for the book tour.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.083
-My book tour?
-Of Mexico,

10:26.166 --> 10:28.791
just three cities
and you leave in...

10:30.541 --> 10:31.541
tomorrow.

10:31.791 --> 10:32.958
-As in?
-Tomorrow.

10:33.041 --> 10:35.041
Okay, you know what?
Take this.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.416
It's on an international plan.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.125
You have to start building
a massive following

10:39.208 --> 10:40.625
for the book on social, okay?

10:40.708 --> 10:42.916
I want to see cute,
casual pictures on Instagram.

Be hilarious on Twitter.

on TikTok.

My true self?

to take the Rubik's Cube?

11:04.708 --> 11:06.041

Do I have to go with him?

Yes, son. He is your dad.

11:21.791 --> 11:22.791
What's up, Max?

11:22.833 --> 11:24.333
Hello, Antonio.

11:24.791 --> 11:26.125
How are you, little man?

11:26.208 --> 11:27.541
Hi Dad!

11:27.833 --> 11:30.791
Not a little man any more,
you have grown up a lot...

11:31.041 --> 11:32.500
You're so grown up! Look!

11:33.375 --> 11:35.125
It's cool, right?

11:36.083 --> 11:37.333
It's super cool, Dad.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.291
You're not too old to play
with small cars, right?

11:40.375 --> 11:42.250
No! It's very cool!

11:42.333 --> 11:43.541
It has a helmet and the
full gear for an adventure.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.291
-Thanks, Dad.
-Cool, little man.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.291
[woman] Don't you think
this might be too much?

11:47.375 --> 11:49.500
I bought him something simple
for his birthday.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.583
-It's only a small car...
-[woman sighs]

11:51.666 --> 11:52.791
...it's really not a big deal.

11:52.875 --> 11:53.958
Besides,
it's not that expensive.

11:54.041 --> 11:55.041
[in English] Okay.

11:55.125 --> 11:56.791
[in Spanish]
I have to leave now.

11:56.875 --> 12:00.500
Remember,
try not to give him candy...

12:00.583 --> 12:03.166
...that he needs to brush
his teeth, and is in bed at 8.

12:03.666 --> 12:05.000
[sighs]

12:05.833 --> 12:06.833
What?

12:07.333 --> 12:08.500
Oh María, it's just that...

12:10.041 --> 12:11.166
A job came up.

12:12.541 --> 12:15.125
No, come on! No...

12:16.875 --> 12:18.375
It's a very important
recording session

12:18.458 --> 12:19.875
in San Miguel de Allende.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.916
Also, it's important
for my reputation!

12:22.083 --> 12:23.166
You have one of those?

12:23.250 --> 12:24.458
[laughs]

12:25.166 --> 12:26.166
Gosh, Max.

12:26.666 --> 12:28.583
How do you manage
to be that rude to me

12:28.666 --> 12:30.375
and still make me laugh?
[chuckles]

12:31.500 --> 12:33.500
So what do I do? What do I do?

12:33.583 --> 12:35.375
-I don't know.
-I can't take Diego with me.

12:35.458 --> 12:37.166
I don't know what to do.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.125
But I can't quit either...

12:39.208 --> 12:40.208
...please?

12:41.875 --> 12:44.416
I promise this is
the last time I let you down.

12:45.250 --> 12:46.708
-Ok?
-Mm-hmm.

12:47.583 --> 12:48.583
[Antonio] Thank you.

12:51.041 --> 12:52.458
Son...

12:54.958 --> 12:56.083
I have to leave.

12:56.791 --> 13:00.208
I'll come get you after
and we'll have a great time...

13:00.291 --> 13:02.750
...and I'll bring something
back for you from my trip.

13:04.541 --> 13:05.583
Thank you.

13:07.708 --> 13:09.291
I love you little man!

13:10.291 --> 13:12.333
See you, Max. Thank you.

13:13.500 --> 13:14.500
I owe you one.

13:14.583 --> 13:16.375
[María] No, no,
you owe me like three hundred!

13:16.458 --> 13:17.666
[Antonio]
Let's make it four hundred!

13:17.750 --> 13:19.000
I'll make it up to you
later, OK?

13:19.083 --> 13:20.083
-Thank you!
-[door closes]

13:23.041 --> 13:25.166
Well, I've still
got this work trip!

13:26.125 --> 13:27.333
So, what do we do?

13:28.625 --> 13:32.416
Well, I can stay
with my great grandpa.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.958
[Max] Of course,
I can take care of him.

13:35.041 --> 13:37.291
No, no. The two of you alone

13:37.416 --> 13:39.166
are more dangerous
than a monkey with a gun.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.625
I am eighty years old.

13:40.708 --> 13:42.375
Exactly.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.333
Come on, go pack!

It's fine.

-Gracias.

14:36.541 --> 14:37.625

14:57.416 --> 14:58.583
-Yes.

This is my family,
Diego and María.

-Hi.
-Hola.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.500
Er, it's Señor "Copper,"
Henry Copper.

15:08.583 --> 15:09.625
I'm sorry.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.791
[in Spanish] I made the card!
I made it!

15:12.958 --> 15:14.875
[in English] Sorry.
What did he say?

15:14.958 --> 15:15.958
He made the card.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.416
Oh! Er, gracias.
Muchas gracias.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.708
Okay, we better hurry.

15:19.791 --> 15:21.250
We've got 30 minutes
to get to your event.

15:21.333 --> 15:22.458
My what, sorry?

15:22.916 --> 15:24.500
Your event, see?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.083
[in Spanish]
It's in Spanish, Mama.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.166
-What?
-It's in Spanish.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.416
Oh yes, of course.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.250
[in English]
I translate for you.

15:30.791 --> 15:32.166
Oh, well, thank you.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.291
[chuckles] Er, so,
what does it say?

15:35.083 --> 15:36.291
-What?
-Email?

15:36.375 --> 15:38.041
You... You said
you'd translate for me.

15:38.125 --> 15:40.833
Oh, no, no, no.
I translate for you.

15:40.916 --> 15:42.458
I'm the translator
of your book.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.791
You're M. F. Rodríguez?

15:47.166 --> 15:48.583
Sí. María Fernando Rodríguez.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.083
-Okay. [chuckles]
-[María] Okay?

15:51.166 --> 15:52.250
-Okay.
-[María] Let's go.

16:39.250 --> 16:41.291
[Max] María, how does it feel

16:41.375 --> 16:43.541
to be related
to a great translator?

16:43.625 --> 16:45.083
-[laughs]
-[Max] Huh?

16:45.166 --> 16:47.166
[music continues
on car stereo]

16:48.083 --> 16:49.125
Yeah.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.958
-[María clears throat]
-It's... not that funny.

16:52.041 --> 16:53.125
[chuckles]

16:53.625 --> 16:54.958
[in Spanish]
Why is she laughing?

16:55.541 --> 16:57.791
This English man thought
I translated his book.

16:57.875 --> 17:00.875
[giggles] That's very funny
because you don't do anything!

17:00.958 --> 17:01.958
[Max exclaims]

17:02.750 --> 17:04.708
[in English] I'm... I'm...
I'm sorry I thought my book

17:04.833 --> 17:07.083
was translated
by your father, all right?

17:07.958 --> 17:10.458
My "father"?
He's my grandfather.

17:11.416 --> 17:13.291
So, either he's very
young-looking,

17:13.375 --> 17:15.125
or I'm an old hag.

17:16.416 --> 17:17.416
Hey, Diego.

17:17.750 --> 17:19.375
-[in Spanish] I'm a hag!
-[Diego giggles]

17:19.458 --> 17:20.750

17:26.625 --> 17:28.708
Do you have your eyes
stuck up your butt, dude?

17:29.750 --> 17:31.333
What's up with that guy?

17:33.125 --> 17:34.208
[sighs]

17:38.250 --> 17:40.083
[in English] So, what did you
think of my book?

17:41.791 --> 17:43.375
Okay, here we are.

[María] Everybody out.

17:49.666 --> 17:50.666
Come on, come on.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.000
[Henry] You really do that
without a seatbelt?

17:52.083 --> 17:53.750
[María in Spanish]
Come on Diego, let's get out.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.375
Help your great grandpa.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.833
Yes, help him, help him.

17:57.958 --> 17:59.125
The car seat!

17:59.208 --> 18:00.250
The seat!

18:01.041 --> 18:02.958
The seat, please!

18:04.666 --> 18:06.250
[in English]
Why are all these people here?

18:06.708 --> 18:08.708
Well, they like your book,
I guess.

18:09.416 --> 18:11.875
So, just get up on stage
and do your thing.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.958
Oh, no. I can't.
I can't. [chuckles]

18:14.041 --> 18:15.791
I mean, I don't speak
a word of Spanish.

18:16.541 --> 18:17.541
Oh, yeah.

18:17.958 --> 18:19.541

Yes, just next to it.

[women chattering excitedly]

19:10.791 --> 19:11.791
Huh.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.375
[in English] Oh. Hi.

19:19.916 --> 19:22.791
[in Spanish] Please welcome

the author
of El Corazón Sensible...

19:25.208 --> 19:26.916
Henry Copper!

19:31.666 --> 19:33.083
[Henry] Er... Oh.

19:37.541 --> 19:39.041
[in English] Thank you.
Gracias.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.416
[host in Spanish]
Welcome, Mr Copper.

19:44.125 --> 19:48.791
First I'd like to thank you,
on behalf of everyone here,

19:48.875 --> 19:50.791
for this gift...

19:50.916 --> 19:52.500
...this delicious book.

19:52.583 --> 19:54.250
[audience exclaiming]

19:54.333 --> 19:56.333
Um... [in English]
They like the book.

19:56.416 --> 19:57.500
[whispers indistinctly]

19:57.583 --> 19:58.583
Well, er...

19:58.708 --> 20:01.250
[in Spanish] Thank you.
Thank you very much.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.583
[audience laughs]

20:03.250 --> 20:06.541
I would like to start,
if I may, by asking you...

20:06.875 --> 20:10.750
...how did you get the idea
for this torrid romance?

20:11.208 --> 20:12.208
[in English] Okay.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.166
She wants to know
where you got the idea.

20:15.583 --> 20:17.291
-The idea? Erm...
-Mm-hmm.

20:17.375 --> 20:18.458
Erm...

20:19.291 --> 20:22.666
Well, I guess the answer
to that, erm,

20:22.750 --> 20:24.916
is, well, it...
it's a mixture.

20:25.708 --> 20:28.958
It's a mixture
of one's experience

20:29.041 --> 20:31.666
and, er, one's imagination.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.041
[audience] Oh!

20:34.750 --> 20:36.208
[in Spanish]
Experience and imagination.

20:36.291 --> 20:38.125
-[audience] Ooh!
-[host chuckles]

20:38.208 --> 20:39.500
[in English] Okay, okay, okay.

20:39.625 --> 20:41.500
[in Spanish] You must be
very imaginative then...

20:41.583 --> 20:42.708
and very experienced!

20:42.791 --> 20:44.041
[laughter]

20:44.125 --> 20:46.000
Of course,
when I say this I'm thinking

20:46.083 --> 20:48.416
of one particular part
of the book.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.875
Do you mind
if I read it out loud?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.375
-Uh...
-[Henry] Er...

20:53.458 --> 20:55.041
You know what?
We would love to.

20:55.125 --> 20:57.958
But Mr. Copper is a busy man.

20:58.041 --> 21:00.875
He has many things to do...
novels to write...

21:00.958 --> 21:03.666
OK. OK. I'll just read it
quickly. Just quickly.

21:04.625 --> 21:05.666
Chapter nine,

21:05.791 --> 21:09.291
the morning
after Claire meets Martin.

21:09.541 --> 21:10.583
[in English]
She's going to read.

21:10.666 --> 21:14.041
[in Spanish] We've all
read it, what's the point?

21:15.083 --> 21:17.583
"Every fibre of Claire's being
was transformed...

21:18.125 --> 21:20.041
...Martin's powerful desire

21:20.125 --> 21:22.916
had overcome
her fear of love."

21:25.791 --> 21:27.166
[in English]
Claire was transformed.

21:27.958 --> 21:29.500
What, that... that's it?

21:29.583 --> 21:31.208
It... It sounded like
there was a bit more to it.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.833
I'm paraphrasing.

21:32.916 --> 21:33.916
Right.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.708
[in Spanish] You describe
the workings

21:36.791 --> 21:39.125
of desire, of lust, so well.

21:39.458 --> 21:40.583
[audience] Mm.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.125
[host] It's incredible.

21:42.208 --> 21:44.708
And best of all it's like you
understand what it is to be a

21:44.791 --> 21:47.833
man and a woman,
sexually possessed.

21:47.916 --> 21:49.291
-[exhales heavily]
-[audience murmurs]

21:49.833 --> 21:50.833
[in English] You're great.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.708
Gracias. [chuckles] Thank you.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.916
[in Spanish]
May I read my favourite part?

21:57.041 --> 21:59.541
Another one? Dear God.

21:59.875 --> 22:02.250
I am going to read THE scene.

22:02.333 --> 22:03.583
[audience] Ooh!

22:03.666 --> 22:04.666
"That night

22:04.750 --> 22:07.458
he came to her again,
charged like a stallion."

22:08.250 --> 22:09.500
"Claire, he said,

22:09.583 --> 22:13.625
we will always long
for each other's touch,

each other's taste,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.833
but it will always
be forbidden."

22:18.916 --> 22:20.375
[in English] Yeah, mm...

22:20.458 --> 22:22.916
That night
he came to her again.

22:23.916 --> 22:27.125
"Claire," he said,
"We will always be together.

"We will always be

let us forget the rules...

we are beasts...

And that?

22:46.791 --> 22:47.916
Yeah, um...

22:48.583 --> 22:50.125
Um... [hesitates]

22:50.208 --> 22:51.208
But... Yeah.

22:51.291 --> 22:52.791
-Could someone else please?
-[María] No.

22:52.875 --> 22:53.875
I can do it.

22:55.166 --> 22:59.250
"Tonight, we are like beasts
in the desert."

22:59.875 --> 23:01.000
"In the desert heat."

23:03.375 --> 23:04.958
Beasts in heat?

23:06.708 --> 23:08.708
That's... That's quite
a free translation.

23:08.791 --> 23:10.125
[laughter]

23:10.166 --> 23:11.250
Erm...

23:15.041 --> 23:17.000
-Please go on.
-[host chuckles] Okay.

23:25.791 --> 23:27.833
[audience exclaiming
excitedly]

23:29.458 --> 23:30.500
[giggles]

23:35.666 --> 23:38.833
"Tonight, Claire, we part..."

23:39.041 --> 23:40.333
[audience murmuring]

23:40.958 --> 23:42.583
"...never to meet again.
The end."

23:42.750 --> 23:44.291
[audience gasps]

23:44.375 --> 23:46.000
[in Spanish]
That's not what it says!

23:46.083 --> 23:47.541
[in English] You don't speak
English at all.

23:47.625 --> 23:48.916
She's making it up!

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
[Henry in English] What?

23:50.083 --> 23:51.166
[in Spanish] Oh so now
we're all translators!

23:51.291 --> 23:53.333
-She's a liar!
-Yes! Translate it properly!

23:53.416 --> 23:55.208
Yes! Translate it properly,
you cow!

23:56.208 --> 23:58.708
Hey, hey...
a little respect, no?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.208
-I mean, I mean...
-[host interrupts in Spanish]

24:01.333 --> 24:02.333
Perhaps you would like
to refresh

24:02.416 --> 24:03.416
your memory of the text.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.541
[in English] Of course. Yeah.

24:04.625 --> 24:05.625
[in Spanish] But...

24:05.708 --> 24:07.083
What the hell
is with this woman?

24:07.166 --> 24:08.250
[woman] It's her job...

24:08.333 --> 24:10.625
No, no, I'll read it.
I'll read it!

24:11.125 --> 24:12.125
[in English] Okay.

24:12.333 --> 24:13.625
"Tonight we're unashamed.

24:13.708 --> 24:15.958
"Tonight we're beasts
in the desert heat.

24:16.666 --> 24:18.083
"Tonight we... [sighs]

24:18.958 --> 24:19.958
"we fudge."

24:20.291 --> 24:21.583
Er, sorry, I didn't quite...

24:21.875 --> 24:22.958
Louder!

24:23.583 --> 24:24.625
"Tonight...

24:27.458 --> 24:28.458
[shouts] "we fuck!"

24:28.541 --> 24:29.958
[audience exclaims in relief]

24:30.083 --> 24:31.541
[woman 2] That's better!

24:32.625 --> 24:34.166
[mic feedback whining]

24:34.625 --> 24:35.958
[indistinct chatter]

-[host chuckles]
-[footsteps thudding]

24:44.083 --> 24:45.541
-Erm...
-[audience groans]

24:45.625 --> 24:46.625
[in English] I'll just...

24:47.208 --> 24:49.291
[all exclaiming in Spanish]

24:49.375 --> 24:51.208
-[applause]
-Bravo, bravo!

24:51.541 --> 24:53.375
What was that all about?

24:53.458 --> 24:55.750
I think your mother
is about to get into trouble.

25:02.708 --> 25:03.791
[in English] What was that?

25:05.875 --> 25:07.000
-[sighs]
-Er...

25:07.708 --> 25:10.791
What's going on,
with the poster?

25:11.666 --> 25:14.333
And why are people sending me
naked videos of themselves?

25:15.083 --> 25:16.875
What have you done to my book?

25:17.416 --> 25:18.500
What...?

25:18.583 --> 25:20.083
I made some changes.

25:21.791 --> 25:22.958
"Some changes"?

25:23.875 --> 25:25.750
Okay, what other parts
have you changed?

25:26.208 --> 25:27.416
Only the boring parts.

25:29.125 --> 25:30.500
Okay. It...

25:30.583 --> 25:32.708
It sounds like you've
rewritten the whole book.

25:33.541 --> 25:35.958
Like I say,
only the boring parts.

25:37.625 --> 25:40.208
Hey, I'm not finished.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.041
Do you know
how long it took me?

25:43.125 --> 25:45.875
Five years of writing,
rewriting,

25:45.958 --> 25:47.833
waiting for the right phrase.

25:47.916 --> 25:49.375
I think maybe
you waited too long.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.791
Listen, and then
you came along,

25:50.875 --> 25:52.875
and you turned it
into a bucket of filth.

25:54.916 --> 25:56.833
-"Filth"?
-Yes, filth.

25:57.541 --> 25:58.541
Miss Rodríguez,

25:58.625 --> 26:01.333
my characters
do not have sex, all right?

26:01.416 --> 26:03.250
Of course, of course not.

26:03.333 --> 26:05.125
A writer
writes from experience.

26:05.708 --> 26:07.416
Oh. [laughs in disbelief]

26:08.833 --> 26:10.916
Do you know what? I can't
believe you're defending

26:11.000 --> 26:13.791
this monstrous sack
of pornography.

26:14.250 --> 26:16.375
-It is not pornography.
-It is pornography!

26:16.458 --> 26:20.125
Claire and Martin make love
once, just like your parents.

26:20.541 --> 26:22.208
Don't bring my parents in...

26:22.625 --> 26:23.666
[María sighs]

26:24.916 --> 26:27.583
I can't believe this.
I'm going mad.

26:28.458 --> 26:30.583
Go on. Tell me,
what else have you changed?

26:30.666 --> 26:32.750
Come on,
what have you changed exactly?

26:32.833 --> 26:33.916
[exhales sharply]

26:34.583 --> 26:36.791
Well, I took out
some of the long descriptions.

26:36.916 --> 26:38.166
What long descriptions?

26:38.291 --> 26:40.833
You spend a page
describing a bicycle

26:40.916 --> 26:42.666
and a sentence
describing the heroine.

26:43.833 --> 26:45.250
But that... that... that's...

26:45.333 --> 26:47.125
And I also improved
the grammar.

26:47.875 --> 26:49.750
There's nothing wrong
with my grammar.

26:49.833 --> 26:51.875
-So you say, Mr. Writer?
-[sighs]

26:52.250 --> 26:54.083
And I made
Claire's husband gay.

26:54.166 --> 26:55.583
Well, I made it clear
he was gay.

26:55.666 --> 26:56.666
He's not gay.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.208
-Why would you make him?
-Come on.

26:58.625 --> 27:00.708
Come on, he was always gay.

27:00.791 --> 27:02.416
He just wasn't comfortable
coming out to you.

27:02.916 --> 27:04.041
Oh. Oh-ho-ho!

27:04.125 --> 27:06.166
[in Spanish] Pedro!
So happy you're here now!

27:06.250 --> 27:07.375
[Pedro] Hi María! [gasps]

27:07.458 --> 27:10.208
[in English] Here he is,
the love guru himself.

27:10.291 --> 27:11.291
-Hello.
-Hello.

27:11.375 --> 27:15.333
I am Pedro, your publisher.
Welcome to Mexico City.

27:15.833 --> 27:16.875
I got you on TV.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.666
But I have a publisher. Jen?

27:19.791 --> 27:22.458
No, no, no. Jen is
your British publisher.

27:22.625 --> 27:24.541
I am your Mexican publisher.

27:24.875 --> 27:27.375
We are going to have
a swell time. Come on.

27:27.458 --> 27:30.708
-Did you say "TV"?
-Yes. Are you excited?

27:30.875 --> 27:31.958
[Max in Spanish]
Where were you?

27:32.083 --> 27:33.750
[in English] T...
TV interview?

27:33.875 --> 27:35.416
[María in Spanish]
We were just talking, Grandpa.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.583
[Pedro in English]
You're going to have fun.

27:36.666 --> 27:38.125
[María in Spanish] I'll
explain later. Get in! Get in!

27:38.208 --> 27:40.208
-[Max in English] Come on.
-[indistinct chatter]

[upbeat folk music playing]

27:47.375 --> 27:49.375
[music continues on radio]

28:02.250 --> 28:03.416
[exhales heavily]

28:07.458 --> 28:09.416
Do you know what? I have
one question. One Question.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.208
Why did you make
Claire's husband gay?

28:11.333 --> 28:13.541
-Do you not like gay?
-Ugh. Typical.

28:13.958 --> 28:17.500
No, that's...
Yes, I do like gay.

28:17.583 --> 28:18.666
I... I...

28:19.375 --> 28:20.750
But Claire's husband
isn't gay.

28:20.833 --> 28:21.833
It gives Claire a motive

28:21.916 --> 28:23.041
-for the affair.
-"Affair"?

28:23.125 --> 28:24.708
After she finds her husband
in bed with Andrew.

28:25.125 --> 28:26.500
Andrew? Who's Andrew?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.166
Martin's brother.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.958
Martin doesn't have a brother.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.208
Well, he does now.

28:31.791 --> 28:33.458
I made him a sexy plumber.

28:33.541 --> 28:35.541
I had to make chapter six
more interesting.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.833
What was wrong
with chapter six?

28:37.916 --> 28:39.125
Nothing happens.

28:39.458 --> 28:41.541
Like, in chapter seven,
and chapter five,

28:41.625 --> 28:43.541
and chapter three,
and chapter one,

28:43.666 --> 28:46.208
and the entire book,
nothing happens. Nothing.

28:46.875 --> 28:47.875
Stop the car.

28:51.333 --> 28:52.333
Stop the car!

28:52.666 --> 28:53.958
[brakes screech]

28:54.500 --> 28:55.500
[sighs]

29:03.583 --> 29:04.875
[in Spanish] Damn English.

29:06.708 --> 29:08.375
-[sheep bleating]
-Shoo, shoo.

29:08.458 --> 29:10.708
[Diego] Mama, shouldn't
you say it's your book?

29:10.791 --> 29:12.000
It seems really unfair.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.333
Welcome to the entire history
of women, Diego.

29:14.416 --> 29:15.708
-[sucks teeth]
-[car door opens]

29:18.666 --> 29:20.000
[woman speaking Spanish]

29:20.083 --> 29:21.083
[María] Hey.

29:22.208 --> 29:24.541
[in English] I'm sorry, okay?

29:25.458 --> 29:26.458
I'm sorry.

29:27.125 --> 29:30.041
But nothing happens.
Nobody does anything.

29:30.125 --> 29:31.666
Nobody says anything.

29:31.750 --> 29:33.250
Everybody
wanders around, like,

29:33.375 --> 29:35.458
"Can I just please
have a glass of water

29:35.541 --> 29:37.500
"while I describe
this beautiful bicycle?"

29:37.583 --> 29:39.833
-[insect buzzing]
-And then, boom.

29:39.916 --> 29:42.500
I mean, well, no boom.
Boom is too exciting.

29:42.958 --> 29:45.125
Then... Then, a squit.

29:45.541 --> 29:47.625
-"Squit"?
-Yeah, squit.

29:48.333 --> 29:49.458
They fall in love,

29:50.583 --> 29:51.708
if you can call it that.

29:52.750 --> 29:53.750
I don't believe this.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.500
[grunts]

29:56.583 --> 29:57.875
Do you know what?
I... I don't believe this.

29:57.958 --> 30:00.500
First, you insult my book,
then you insult me.

30:01.291 --> 30:03.458
Now I'm expected
to go on television

30:03.541 --> 30:06.083
and... and say
that this morass of filth

30:06.166 --> 30:08.333
is something that I wrote.

30:10.125 --> 30:11.166
[sighs]

30:13.250 --> 30:14.791
Do you know what?
No, I've had enough.

30:15.916 --> 30:17.458
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Henry] Yup! Yup!

30:18.375 --> 30:20.125
-Okay.
-Yes, okay!

30:23.500 --> 30:25.625
God! Has anyone
got any phone signal?

30:28.750 --> 30:29.791
[sighs]

30:31.041 --> 30:32.375
Listen to me, both of you.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.750
This book is a hit.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.875
So please, work together,

30:37.958 --> 30:40.791
and help me sell it,
so we can all make some money.

30:40.916 --> 30:42.208
She has ruined my book,

30:42.291 --> 30:44.916
and I plan on telling
every single person I meet.

30:45.250 --> 30:46.375
And then what?

30:46.500 --> 30:47.750
You would be known
as the idiot

30:47.833 --> 30:49.083
who didn't even
read his own book.

30:49.666 --> 30:51.000
Worst, the man who said,

30:51.083 --> 30:52.666
"Oh, yes,
my book is a success.

30:52.791 --> 30:54.416
"But I would like it more
if it was a flop."

30:55.083 --> 30:56.916
A boring flop
that nobody wants to read.

30:57.291 --> 30:58.916
Okay, María. You spiced it up.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.375
And now you think you wrote
50 Shades of Grey?

31:02.375 --> 31:03.666
But that book
says on the cover

31:03.750 --> 31:05.208
"Henry Cooper,"
not "María Rodríguez."

31:05.291 --> 31:06.458
[Henry] Copper.

31:07.208 --> 31:08.625
María, you want
to tell everybody?

31:09.291 --> 31:11.458
Okay, fine.
We'll have a scandal,

31:11.541 --> 31:12.958
and the book dies
a quick death.

31:13.958 --> 31:15.375
So please, smile.

31:16.791 --> 31:20.083
Tell people what they want
to hear. And get into the car.

31:20.708 --> 31:21.791
Argh.

31:30.166 --> 31:32.250

[music continues on radio]

31:50.625 --> 31:52.708
Does this car
have air conditioning?

31:53.625 --> 31:57.583
No. It's a Volkswagen Beetle,
not the Ritz hotel.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.958
Most cars have air
conditioning. It's not rare.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.916
That's broken. Also...

32:04.291 --> 32:06.166
[music blaring]

32:06.250 --> 32:07.708
It is the radio!

32:23.333 --> 32:24.625
We're here!

32:25.625 --> 32:26.708
Are we?

32:29.708 --> 32:31.458
Oh, for Pete's sake.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.333
You should see
the one we rejected.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.250
[woman in Spanish] Oh my God!

32:39.333 --> 32:40.958
Oh my God!

32:41.041 --> 32:43.416
It's you! Henry Copper!
[gasps]

32:43.500 --> 32:45.291
I love your book! [chuckles]

32:45.958 --> 32:47.541
-[in English] Er, sorry?

Thank you. Um...

Sorry. This is my...

Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

your autograph after the show.

Maybe you can give her

33:20.541 --> 33:21.583

Oh, God.

It makes me tingle inside!

33:40.833 --> 33:42.000
Henry, bienvenido.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.208
[in English] Welcome.

33:43.333 --> 33:45.333
Thank you. Thank you
for having me, Beatriz.

33:45.625 --> 33:47.833
[in Spanish] And his
translator, María Rodeo.

33:48.083 --> 33:49.500
Uh, Rodríguez.

33:49.708 --> 33:52.625
[in English] Henry.
You studied English literature

33:52.708 --> 33:53.750
-and the classics.
-Yeah.

33:53.833 --> 33:55.291
So, people might
expect your book

33:55.375 --> 33:56.958
to be boring, but it's not.

33:57.333 --> 33:59.208
It actually reads
like a telenovela,

33:59.291 --> 34:01.208
like a really sexy soap opera.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.541
Y... Yes.

34:03.791 --> 34:04.916
Yeah. Well, er...

34:05.375 --> 34:07.791
I... I... I'm open
to many influences.

34:08.791 --> 34:12.208
Er, not every story about love
has to be about sex.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.208
You know, someone once wrote,

34:14.625 --> 34:18.833
"Chastity is the body
in the soul's keeping."

34:18.916 --> 34:19.916
Okay, but please tell us,

34:20.000 --> 34:21.791
what's your
favorite telenovela?

34:27.625 --> 34:30.833
The one with...
with the twins...

34:33.125 --> 34:34.875
and... and the president

34:35.875 --> 34:38.041
and the stray dog.

34:38.083 --> 34:39.083
[gasps]

34:39.208 --> 34:41.625
[in Spanish] Of course.
The Usurper!

34:41.708 --> 34:42.958
[in English] What a classic!

34:43.041 --> 34:45.208
-[women chuckle]
-[chuckles dryly] Ha.

34:45.291 --> 34:49.125
Yeah. Erm, but this novel,
my work, erm,

34:50.166 --> 34:53.583
it's nothing
like a telenovela.

34:53.666 --> 34:55.458
It's very, very different.
The way I approached...

34:55.541 --> 34:57.000
What's wrong with telenovelas?

34:57.833 --> 34:59.958
I mean, telenovelas
contain drama,

35:00.041 --> 35:01.791
excitement, emotion, story.

35:01.916 --> 35:03.666
María, since
you really like talking,

35:03.750 --> 35:05.041
I have a question for you.

35:06.125 --> 35:07.791
Was it hard,
as a mere translator,

35:07.875 --> 35:09.166
to convey the meaning

35:09.250 --> 35:11.958
of Señor Copper's
amazing words?

35:12.541 --> 35:14.500
-[chuckles]
-Thank you. Thank you.

35:14.958 --> 35:16.000
[Henry chuckles]

35:16.083 --> 35:17.458
No.

35:17.541 --> 35:18.583
[in Spanish]
I just changed everything.

35:19.583 --> 35:20.583
I'm sorry, what?

35:21.250 --> 35:22.458
Yes, I mean...

35:22.541 --> 35:24.000
[tense music playing]

35:24.250 --> 35:27.458
...I changed everything
from English to Spanish...

35:27.541 --> 35:29.375
...making sure to keep

35:29.458 --> 35:32.458
the brilliant, amazing words
of Mr. Copper.

35:34.125 --> 35:35.500
You must feel very lucky?

35:37.208 --> 35:38.666
You have no idea.

35:38.750 --> 35:39.875
[chuckles]

35:40.000 --> 35:41.458
Yes. Yes.

35:42.083 --> 35:43.583
[in English] Yeah, we, er...

35:43.666 --> 35:45.083
We work very well together.

35:45.166 --> 35:46.166
Uh-huh.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.666
[women chattering]

35:48.791 --> 35:50.583
[in Spanish]
Always ask for a hardback.

35:50.666 --> 35:53.041
More money for the author...
and me.

35:53.541 --> 35:54.541
[in English]
Oh, Henry, please...

35:54.625 --> 35:56.541
-[Henry] Hola.
-Hola.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.250
[in Spanish] Your book
has filled my heart with love

35:58.333 --> 36:01.000
and my body with desire.

36:01.083 --> 36:02.208
[Pedro in English]
Next! Shoo, shoo.

36:02.625 --> 36:04.791
I thought you'd be
more attractive in person.

36:05.416 --> 36:06.541
[Pedro in Spanish] You!

36:07.166 --> 36:11.208
Mr. Copper, I never understood
men before I read this book.

36:11.291 --> 36:12.833
Now my bed is never empty!

36:13.833 --> 36:14.833
[in English] "Señor Copper,

36:14.916 --> 36:18.333
"your breath smells
like a monkey's ass."

36:20.708 --> 36:21.958
Sí.

36:22.041 --> 36:23.250
Gracias.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.875
[in Spanish]
My partner and I dress

36:25.958 --> 36:27.500
as your characters for...

36:27.583 --> 36:28.958
...our intimate moments.

36:29.041 --> 36:30.916
[in English]
He and her partner

36:31.041 --> 36:33.333
dress as your characters,
and they like to...

36:33.791 --> 36:35.083
[whispers indistinctly]

36:35.166 --> 36:36.750
Oh, come on.

36:36.833 --> 36:37.958
Give me your autograph.

36:38.291 --> 36:39.291
Okay.

36:39.375 --> 36:40.875
[in Spanish] Here, here. Look!

36:40.958 --> 36:42.500
[in English] Oh, God.
This is happening.

36:42.583 --> 36:44.583
[woman moaning]

36:46.041 --> 36:47.625
-[in Spanish] Thank you.
-[Henry] Thank you.

36:47.708 --> 36:49.125
No, no. Stop, stop.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.500
-Hola.
-Hola.

36:51.916 --> 36:53.166
For Miguelito.

36:53.250 --> 36:55.458
[in English]
Miguelito's having an orgasm.

36:55.541 --> 36:56.791
[signing]

36:56.875 --> 36:57.958
Gracias.

36:58.708 --> 36:59.833
Good luck.

36:59.916 --> 37:02.333
[light music playing]

37:07.416 --> 37:10.041
-[device ringing]
-[gasps]

37:22.625 --> 37:24.250
-Jen...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:24.333 --> 37:26.041
Put some clothes on, please.

37:28.458 --> 37:29.458
Oh.

37:30.208 --> 37:31.583
[mumbling] What are you
doing up this late?

37:32.416 --> 37:33.833
It's00 p.m.,

37:33.916 --> 37:35.375
which I realize
isn't that late.

37:35.458 --> 37:38.083
It's00 where you are,
though. Why?

37:38.166 --> 37:39.625
Henry, I'm just checking in.

37:39.708 --> 37:42.250
I'm hearing attendance
is through the roof.

37:42.333 --> 37:43.666
So is my blood pressure.

37:43.750 --> 37:45.791
Jen, did you know
my so-called translator

37:45.875 --> 37:46.958
has changed every single word?

37:47.041 --> 37:48.125
I think we've got
a bad connection.

37:48.208 --> 37:49.958
-Every single word?
-I'm not getting any of that.

37:50.041 --> 37:51.458
-Jen?
-[Jen shushing]

37:51.583 --> 37:53.583
Listen,
because of the following

37:53.708 --> 37:55.333
you've been building
over there,

37:55.416 --> 37:56.833
The Sensible Heart

37:56.916 --> 37:59.458
is getting re-released
in the UK.

37:59.541 --> 38:01.375
[fumbles] That's... That's...

38:01.458 --> 38:03.291
-That's great news!
-Yeah.

38:03.375 --> 38:04.833
-Right? That's...
-Yeah.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.833
-That's good.
-It is great news.

38:06.916 --> 38:08.000
What we're going to do, Henry,

38:08.083 --> 38:10.000
we're going to take
the Mexican version,

38:10.083 --> 38:11.375
which is so popular,

38:11.458 --> 38:14.666
and we're going to have it
translated back into English.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.000
Everyone's gonna love it.

38:16.083 --> 38:17.708
We've got a new jacket
and everything.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.416
[sighs] Show me.

38:20.500 --> 38:21.958
-Huh?
-Jen...

38:23.000 --> 38:24.750
-Oh, the jacket, yeah...
-Jen, show me.

38:25.875 --> 38:27.000
Hello.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.833
Jen... [sighs]

38:29.916 --> 38:30.958
God.

38:32.125 --> 38:33.125
Jen.

38:33.208 --> 38:34.250
What?

38:35.916 --> 38:38.125
Is it the nipple, Henry?
We can lose the nipple.

38:38.208 --> 38:39.208
-There's only one.
-What's the point?

38:39.291 --> 38:41.125
You may as well
just include a free poster

38:41.208 --> 38:43.416
of a couple having sex
on the back of a horse.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.500
That's funny.

38:44.875 --> 38:46.666
Now, you're thinking, Henry.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.291
Don't actually do... Oh.

38:48.375 --> 38:49.875
Okay, sweet dreams. Talk soon.

38:49.958 --> 38:51.083
Yeah, thanks.

38:51.166 --> 38:52.666
-Bye.
-Thanks, Jen. Thanks.

38:57.958 --> 38:59.125
[fake-sobs]

39:00.375 --> 39:01.833
I need a drink.

39:03.416 --> 39:05.916
[romantic Spanish song
playing]

39:06.000 --> 39:07.500
[indistinct conversation]

39:15.916 --> 39:16.958
Hmm.

39:27.791 --> 39:29.500
[Henry] Killing
someone else's darlings?

39:30.208 --> 39:31.625
[sighs]

39:31.708 --> 39:33.375
I don't even know
what that means.

39:34.708 --> 39:36.958
-More translation?
-I'm writing.

39:38.375 --> 39:40.208
Mm, I can see that.
What are you writing?

39:42.208 --> 39:44.166
Characters
that is for a novel.

39:44.708 --> 39:45.708
You should try it.

39:46.333 --> 39:47.708
[chuckles sarcastically]

39:48.583 --> 39:50.583
Well, I'm sorry
to be intruding.

39:51.375 --> 39:52.458
I can go if you like.

39:52.541 --> 39:55.583
No, please. Just, be my guest.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.291
Only because
I can't get back to sleep.

39:59.458 --> 40:01.666
-[Henry groans]
-[music playing softly]

40:06.333 --> 40:07.333
So, tell me...

40:08.583 --> 40:09.583
What's it about, the novel?

40:10.500 --> 40:13.125
Everyone seems to like
your ideas better than mine.

40:13.208 --> 40:14.333
Oh, no, no.

40:14.958 --> 40:18.541
I don't have time to write it,
anyway, so...

40:18.625 --> 40:19.666
So, what do you drink?

40:19.750 --> 40:21.916
Er, what are you
drinking, beer?

40:23.458 --> 40:25.500
How do you even
ask for a beer?

40:25.583 --> 40:28.083
Is it, "Uno beero, por favor"?

40:28.166 --> 40:29.625
[men laughing]

40:31.250 --> 40:32.375
[María mutters indistinctly]

40:35.208 --> 40:37.208
[laughter and chatter]

40:39.666 --> 40:40.666
Antonio?

40:41.958 --> 40:42.958
[in Spanish] What the hell?

40:43.041 --> 40:44.666
What's up, María?

40:45.666 --> 40:46.666
What are you doing here?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.500
What am I doing here?
What are YOU doing here?

40:50.125 --> 40:51.791
You said you were
in San Miguel.

40:51.875 --> 40:54.041
Ah, yes. I did go.

40:54.125 --> 40:55.708
We had the recording session,

40:55.791 --> 40:57.000
-and I did really well!
-[sighs]

40:57.708 --> 41:01.916
[sighs] I'm sorry,
I know I should have told you.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.750
But that's how
these things are...

41:03.833 --> 41:05.583
...they invited me on a tour
so here I am.

41:08.291 --> 41:10.041
[imperceptible]

41:12.291 --> 41:13.791
Where is Diego?

41:14.291 --> 41:16.458
Where do you think? Sleeping.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.125
[Antonio scoffs]

41:18.541 --> 41:21.208
Let's see.
You left my son alone?

41:22.750 --> 41:24.791
You really are unbelievable.

41:34.375 --> 41:35.375
[in English]
Everything all right?

41:38.083 --> 41:39.500
Who... Who was that?

41:39.583 --> 41:41.375
Oh, um, nobody.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.833
He's... He's a nobody.

41:44.541 --> 41:45.541
Sorry.

41:53.833 --> 41:56.000
[light instrumental music
playing]

42:10.166 --> 42:11.833
[Henry] Where are we going?

42:11.916 --> 42:12.958
Palenque.

42:13.041 --> 42:15.208
Our last stop
before we all go home.

42:15.583 --> 42:16.875
It's an old Mayan city.

42:16.958 --> 42:18.458
Is it far?

42:18.541 --> 42:19.916
Only, like, 10 hours.

42:22.625 --> 42:23.791
Ten?

42:23.875 --> 42:26.041
[light instrumental music
continues]

42:34.958 --> 42:35.958
Henry.

42:44.875 --> 42:46.583
It's so cold.
Why is it so cold?

42:47.000 --> 42:48.541
Because it's Mexico,
it has to be hot?

42:49.125 --> 42:50.458
Well, yes.

42:50.958 --> 42:52.666
[scoffs] Unbelievable.

42:52.750 --> 42:54.291
I never met anyone
who was racist

42:54.375 --> 42:55.375
about the weather before.

42:55.958 --> 42:57.416
I mean, do you hear me say,

42:57.500 --> 42:58.875
"It's always raining
in England"?

42:58.958 --> 43:01.333
But it is always raining
in England.

43:01.416 --> 43:02.458
[Max in Spanish] Here!

43:04.125 --> 43:05.375
[Henry] Oh, gracias.

43:15.583 --> 43:16.625
Erm...

43:17.208 --> 43:18.791
[in English] What sort
of blanket is this?

43:19.083 --> 43:21.125
It belonged to my Alicia.

43:21.208 --> 43:23.041
Was... Was...
Was that your wife?

43:23.125 --> 43:25.166
No, my dog.

43:25.791 --> 43:27.041
I miss her.

43:28.916 --> 43:31.458
She died in...
in that blanket.

43:34.750 --> 43:35.750
-[thud]
-[car rattles]

43:35.833 --> 43:36.916
[Max exclaims in Spanish]

43:37.333 --> 43:38.875
Ay, no!

43:40.708 --> 43:41.708
[grunts]

43:42.666 --> 43:43.666
[sighs]

43:43.750 --> 43:44.916
Hold this.

43:45.416 --> 43:46.583
Okay. Wow.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.250
It's a tire.

43:49.291 --> 43:52.250
Yes, sorry, this just really
isn't my area.

43:52.333 --> 43:54.041
-Anyone can see that.
-[indistinct chatter]

43:54.125 --> 43:55.125
[Henry] Is it that obvious?

43:55.666 --> 43:56.666
Yeah.

43:57.416 --> 43:59.000
You've had an easy life.

43:59.625 --> 44:01.083
Well, that's not true.

44:01.666 --> 44:02.833
[María] Isn't it?

44:03.250 --> 44:05.166
Okay, let me tell you
the life you've lived.

44:07.666 --> 44:10.375
A beautiful house with garden.

44:11.083 --> 44:14.791
Private school, university,
and now you're a writer.

44:15.375 --> 44:17.958
And you're not rich,
but you have an easy life.

44:18.750 --> 44:20.041
And maybe, sometimes,

44:20.125 --> 44:22.458
you get a sore finger
from typing too much.

44:23.500 --> 44:26.666
I'm sure the life
of a translator must be awful.

44:27.666 --> 44:28.958
Is that what you think I am?

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
A translator?

44:34.750 --> 44:37.666
I work in a bar. And when
I don't work in a bar,

44:38.416 --> 44:39.541
I work in a kitchen.

44:39.625 --> 44:41.916
And when I don't do that,
I go to sleep.

44:43.166 --> 44:45.500
And if I'm lucky, sometimes,
I make notes for a novel

44:45.583 --> 44:47.291
that I'll never have time
to write.

44:49.083 --> 44:50.958
So, like I said,

44:52.041 --> 44:53.625
you have an easy life.

44:54.791 --> 44:56.333
You know,

44:56.416 --> 44:57.791
I could tell
from reading your book

44:57.875 --> 44:59.625
that you don't know
anything about life.

45:00.291 --> 45:01.750
[speaks Spanish]

45:01.833 --> 45:03.833
[in English]
You have no experience.

45:04.666 --> 45:05.916
Yes, I do.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.375
-Of course, I do. Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

45:07.458 --> 45:08.708
And you've never been in love.

45:08.791 --> 45:09.791
How do you know that?

45:09.875 --> 45:11.416
I told you, I read your book.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.333
This pure love you talk about
doesn't exist.

45:16.458 --> 45:17.541
Aah!

45:17.625 --> 45:18.625
[María exclaims in Spanish]

45:18.708 --> 45:19.708
You okay?

45:20.375 --> 45:21.500
[sighs]

45:22.083 --> 45:23.208
Do you want me to...?

45:25.666 --> 45:27.625
You know, the only reason
you're even here

45:27.708 --> 45:30.208
is because of the words
I wrote about love.

45:30.333 --> 45:31.916
Do you know how that feels?

45:32.708 --> 45:35.041
[in Spanish] Do you want
to know what love is?

45:36.083 --> 45:37.500
Love is being lied to.

45:38.125 --> 45:40.083
Love leaves you stranded...

45:40.166 --> 45:42.541
...alone, and penniless...

45:42.625 --> 45:43.958
...with a grandfather
and a child

45:44.041 --> 45:46.333
who won't let you
even breathe...

45:47.416 --> 45:48.458
Ay, Diego...

45:49.250 --> 45:51.041
Diego, listen to me...

45:51.125 --> 45:52.416
No, no I didn't mean it!

45:53.833 --> 45:55.916
Diego, Diego, Diego...

46:07.041 --> 46:08.041
Erm...

46:08.583 --> 46:09.583
[in English] Let me try.

46:10.458 --> 46:11.541
[María] Mm.

46:17.708 --> 46:19.750
[somber music playing]

46:22.583 --> 46:24.208
-Hola.
-Hola.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Er...

46:27.083 --> 46:28.916
Hi, can I sit?

46:31.500 --> 46:32.500
Yup.

46:32.875 --> 46:33.875
Okay.

46:36.875 --> 46:38.208
Okay. [grunts]

46:39.083 --> 46:40.083
Er...

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Whew.

46:42.791 --> 46:43.916
The only, er...

46:44.833 --> 46:47.375
The only thing I remember
about being a child

46:48.000 --> 46:49.875
is just how
bloody awful it is.

46:50.416 --> 46:53.625
Yeah, everyone telling you
what to do.

46:55.125 --> 46:56.625
I mean, literally everyone.

46:56.833 --> 46:58.166
Your parents...

46:59.166 --> 47:00.416
Teachers...

47:00.916 --> 47:02.458
Even the lollipop man.

47:03.291 --> 47:04.500
[chuckles]

47:04.583 --> 47:06.000
Do you have lollipop men here?

47:06.083 --> 47:07.583
[in Spanish]
I don't speak English.

47:09.750 --> 47:11.458
[in English] Right. Yeah.

47:13.041 --> 47:14.583
[in Spanish] Don't speak...

47:14.958 --> 47:16.041
[in English] Ooh, here we go.

47:16.125 --> 47:18.708
[in Spanish] One moment.

47:19.416 --> 47:20.416
[in English] I don't suppose

47:20.500 --> 47:22.291
there's a child-parent
section here,

47:22.375 --> 47:23.708
but let's have a go.

47:23.791 --> 47:24.916
Er...

47:25.375 --> 47:26.458
Okay.

47:26.541 --> 47:27.583
Er...

47:27.666 --> 47:29.666
[in Spanish]
I wish... to buy...

47:29.791 --> 47:30.791
some hens.

47:32.500 --> 47:33.541
[in English] No, I know.

47:33.625 --> 47:35.000
[chuckles]

47:35.125 --> 47:37.041
[in Spanish] Your mother...

47:37.125 --> 47:38.791
is...

47:38.875 --> 47:39.875
ill.

47:39.958 --> 47:41.958
[in English] No. No, no...

47:42.041 --> 47:44.708
[in Spanish] Your mother...
is... angry.

47:46.166 --> 47:47.208
But...

47:47.750 --> 47:48.750
I love you.

47:49.250 --> 47:50.250
[softly] I love you.

47:50.916 --> 47:52.708
She...loves you.

47:53.333 --> 47:54.500
She...loves you.

47:54.583 --> 47:56.958
Erm, the woman...

47:57.041 --> 47:58.041
is crazy...

47:58.500 --> 47:59.708
[both chuckle]

47:59.791 --> 48:01.541
...but she loves you...

48:01.625 --> 48:03.875
because, er...

48:03.958 --> 48:06.000
...you are...

48:06.083 --> 48:07.083
her husband.

48:07.541 --> 48:08.625
[chuckles softly]

48:09.333 --> 48:10.416
Her man.

48:12.500 --> 48:15.833
She is angry, erm...

48:15.916 --> 48:17.916
with me because...

48:18.041 --> 48:19.541
I am...

48:20.833 --> 48:21.833
a spoon.

48:21.916 --> 48:24.000
[laughs]

48:24.083 --> 48:25.833
Please...

48:25.916 --> 48:27.083
show me...

48:27.166 --> 48:28.208
your towels.

48:28.291 --> 48:30.541
-[giggles]
-Er...

48:32.166 --> 48:33.458
I have broken my bottom.

48:33.541 --> 48:34.750
[giggles]

48:34.833 --> 48:36.125
[Henry laughs]

48:38.833 --> 48:39.833
Erm...

48:40.750 --> 48:41.791
You understand?

48:42.625 --> 48:44.250
-[softly] Mm.
-[laughs]

48:44.750 --> 48:45.750
[in English] It's okay.

48:47.500 --> 48:48.500
Er...

48:52.666 --> 48:54.666
[gentle music playing]

48:56.791 --> 48:57.791
[Pedro] Smile!

48:58.166 --> 48:59.333
[Max laughing]

49:00.375 --> 49:01.541
[in Spanish] Very good,
Pedro, very good.

49:01.625 --> 49:03.500
Mama, you didn't say
he was funny!

49:03.583 --> 49:05.125
[María] Where were you?

49:07.250 --> 49:08.250
Ay.

49:08.333 --> 49:10.250
Can you forgive me, son?

49:10.333 --> 49:11.708
[Diego] Mm. Mm-hmm.

49:13.916 --> 49:15.791
I'm sorry my love.

49:15.875 --> 49:17.500
Can I have a hug?

49:21.791 --> 49:23.208
[kissing loudly]

49:41.416 --> 49:43.625
[pop music playing]

49:45.875 --> 49:47.083
[cell phone chimes]

49:47.958 --> 49:48.958
[music continues
on car stereo]

49:49.041 --> 49:50.083
[cell phone chimes]

49:58.333 --> 49:59.333
[in English] I must say,
they're saying

49:59.416 --> 50:00.916
some nice things
about the book.

50:08.708 --> 50:10.916
[pop music continues playing]

50:31.083 --> 50:32.958
Oh, thank you.

50:38.833 --> 50:40.416
-What is this?
-[people cheering]

50:40.875 --> 50:42.083
[María chuckles]

50:42.166 --> 50:43.375
[Henry] Is this for us?

50:43.458 --> 50:45.458
[people cheering
and clamoring]

50:47.000 --> 50:48.250
[María] Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

50:48.333 --> 50:49.333
[Henry] Oh, my God!

50:49.416 --> 50:50.458
This is crazy.

50:50.541 --> 50:52.166
[fans clamoring]

50:52.750 --> 50:54.041
[Henry] Wow.

50:54.125 --> 50:55.125
Gracias.

50:58.083 --> 50:59.708
-[laughter]
-[María speaks indistinctly]

51:00.583 --> 51:01.916
[laughing]

51:13.375 --> 51:15.375
[people chattering]

51:17.500 --> 51:18.541
[mouths]

51:30.291 --> 51:32.333
Good evening, everybody,
and welcome

51:32.416 --> 51:35.125
to a very special event,
live on TV

51:35.208 --> 51:37.625
across this beautiful nation.
And tonight,

51:37.708 --> 51:41.166
I am very proud to present
the author of an amazing book,

51:41.250 --> 51:42.625
El Corazón Sensible.

51:43.166 --> 51:45.291
Henry Copper. Welcome!

51:45.416 --> 51:46.875
[all cheering and applauding]

51:48.833 --> 51:49.833
Gracias.

51:49.916 --> 51:51.875
And with him,
his translator...

51:51.958 --> 51:53.291
María Rodríguez!

51:53.375 --> 51:54.750
Yes, María!

51:54.833 --> 51:55.875
[host] María Rodríguez,
that's right.

51:55.958 --> 51:56.958
[María] That's me.

51:57.041 --> 51:58.333
You already have fans.

51:59.958 --> 52:01.250
[in Spanish] Do you have
the TV remote? Turn it up!

52:01.333 --> 52:04.000
[host in English]
One of the main themes

52:04.083 --> 52:06.041
of this wonderful book
of yours

52:06.125 --> 52:08.625
is the relationship
between two people

52:08.708 --> 52:10.833
that really care
and love each other.

52:10.916 --> 52:12.291
Whether it's a man
and a woman...

52:12.375 --> 52:13.375
Yes.

52:13.458 --> 52:14.583
Or a woman and a woman...

52:16.125 --> 52:17.166
Page 92!

52:17.250 --> 52:19.041
[audience members laugh
and chatter]

52:19.125 --> 52:20.916
Yes, er...

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Indeed.

52:22.083 --> 52:25.666
Even though
the book is quite, er, lively,

52:26.291 --> 52:29.916
what it's really about,
for me, is love.

52:31.208 --> 52:32.583
Love is,

52:32.666 --> 52:34.750
well, love is at the heart
of everything, isn't it?

52:34.833 --> 52:38.250
It's the one thing that we're,
all of us, searching for.

52:38.666 --> 52:42.500
For me, love is patience,
more than passion.

52:43.708 --> 52:44.833
[host] But, Henry, your book

52:44.916 --> 52:47.333
is completely full of passion,
isn't it?

52:47.416 --> 52:48.416
[Henry and María] Mm-hmm.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.041
Well, at least,
passion about sex, anyway.

52:50.125 --> 52:51.416
-[chuckles]
-[María] Mm-hmm.

52:52.291 --> 52:53.875
Yes, it is.

52:53.958 --> 52:55.250
That it is.

52:55.333 --> 52:57.500
Er, but I think
there was something

52:57.583 --> 53:00.250
that was slightly lost
in the translation.

53:00.333 --> 53:01.333
Erm...

53:01.416 --> 53:04.458
Well, you know,
maybe love itself is not good.

53:05.666 --> 53:09.166
'Cause love is a dream, right?
It's a... It's a mirage.

53:09.625 --> 53:11.708
Love will always let us down.

53:12.250 --> 53:13.708
People let us down.

53:13.791 --> 53:15.833
People are flawed.

53:15.916 --> 53:17.083
-[María clears throat]
-Er...

53:17.166 --> 53:19.166
Love is an ideal.

53:20.208 --> 53:23.458
And ideals, unlike people,
are not real.

53:28.291 --> 53:29.708
Well... Sorry. [chuckling]

53:29.791 --> 53:31.750
-We agree to disagree.
-Yeah. [laughs]

53:31.833 --> 53:33.458
[Antonio in Spanish]
Who is this guy?

53:33.541 --> 53:34.750
[mutters indistinctly]

53:35.583 --> 53:36.583
[scoffs]

53:37.000 --> 53:41.208
[in English] I am going
to name my child after you.

53:42.208 --> 53:43.708
Er, you don't need to do that.

53:43.791 --> 53:45.250
-Yes!
-[Henry] No.

53:45.375 --> 53:47.500
Henry Copper Valdez.

53:47.583 --> 53:50.250
-That's good, hmm?
-Órale.

53:50.375 --> 53:52.833
Er, but...
But what if it's a girl?

53:52.916 --> 53:54.083
[speaks Spanish]

53:54.458 --> 53:55.791
You could call her María.

53:55.875 --> 53:57.291
-[Henry] There you go.
-Nah.

53:57.375 --> 53:58.375
Erm...

53:58.458 --> 54:00.916
-Henrietta Copper Valdez.
-[fans exclaim agreeingly]

54:01.000 --> 54:02.791
-[overlapping chatter]
-[Henry] Henrietta.

54:02.875 --> 54:06.958
Henry, we wrote
our own fan fiction

54:07.041 --> 54:08.500
based on your book.

54:08.583 --> 54:09.583
[women chuckle]

54:11.250 --> 54:13.083
Wow, guys.

54:13.166 --> 54:14.666
-You like it?
-[Henry chuckles] Oh, wow.

54:14.750 --> 54:16.333
It's fantastic.

54:16.833 --> 54:18.500
Just a quick... Who is this?

54:18.583 --> 54:20.000
It's Thomas.

54:20.083 --> 54:21.083
[in Spanish]
Thomas the chauffeur!

54:21.666 --> 54:23.083
[in English] The love machine.

54:23.166 --> 54:25.416
-[all laugh]
-[Henry] Yes, he is.

54:25.500 --> 54:28.416
Thomas, with the big heart,

54:28.500 --> 54:30.250
who makes love
to everyone in the book.

54:30.625 --> 54:31.833
-To everyone?
-[woman 1] Everyone.

54:31.958 --> 54:33.125
[woman 2] Everyone.

54:33.208 --> 54:35.041
To everyone. There we go.

54:35.125 --> 54:36.541
Henry Copper...

54:38.250 --> 54:40.250
Henry Copper...

54:46.416 --> 54:48.083
[in Spanish] Who are you?

55:02.750 --> 55:04.208
[in English]
I know you're there.

55:04.291 --> 55:06.333
I can hear
your English breathing.

55:06.416 --> 55:07.416
[Henry chuckles]

55:10.833 --> 55:11.833
English people don't breathe

55:11.916 --> 55:13.625
any differently
to other people.

55:13.750 --> 55:14.750
Of course they do.

55:15.375 --> 55:17.000
It's all that roast beef.

55:17.083 --> 55:18.208
"Roast beef"?

55:18.291 --> 55:19.916
Roast beef, yeah.

55:21.833 --> 55:23.083
Are you following me,

55:24.125 --> 55:26.041
with that bottle of tequila?

55:27.000 --> 55:28.166
Mm-hmm.

55:29.750 --> 55:31.625
Are you flirting with me?

55:34.750 --> 55:35.750
No, er...

55:37.041 --> 55:40.416
Since it's my last night
in Mexico,

55:40.500 --> 55:42.750
I just thought
you might wanna share it.

55:42.833 --> 55:44.041
It's a big bottle.
Er, I don't know,

55:44.125 --> 55:46.041
someone gave it to me
at the fan event.

55:46.125 --> 55:47.916
Mm. Let's drink!

55:48.041 --> 55:49.208
-Yeah, okay.
-Yeah.

55:50.583 --> 55:51.583
[María] Mmm.

55:53.041 --> 55:54.416
I like it here.

55:54.541 --> 55:56.041
-Yes, right?
-Yeah.

55:56.125 --> 55:58.833
-It's so cool.
-Ah, it's hot.

55:58.916 --> 56:00.833
[María chuckles] You English.

56:00.916 --> 56:02.958
-Always so...
-[eerie snarling]

56:03.041 --> 56:04.583
What was that?

56:05.041 --> 56:06.541
What was that?
Was that a tiger?

56:07.666 --> 56:09.083
[chuckles] A tiger?

56:09.166 --> 56:10.958
Or a lion? I... I don't know.

56:11.041 --> 56:13.041
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the famous Mexican lion.

56:13.708 --> 56:15.333
[Henry] Okay, what was it?
What was that?

56:15.666 --> 56:17.458
-It's the monkeys.
-The monkeys?

56:17.541 --> 56:19.166
That was... That was a monkey?

56:19.250 --> 56:20.333
-That was a monkey.
-Sounded like a dragon.

56:21.208 --> 56:22.916
[María laughs,
blows raspberries]

56:23.375 --> 56:24.583
What?

56:24.666 --> 56:26.375
-You were scared.
-I was scared.

56:26.458 --> 56:28.500
Just for a minute.

56:28.958 --> 56:31.583
[chuckles] And you don't
mind saying that?

56:31.666 --> 56:32.666
Why would I?

56:33.833 --> 56:35.375
No, it's just
that a lot of men would rather

56:35.458 --> 56:37.500
be killed by a monkey than,
you know,

56:37.625 --> 56:39.208
admit they were scared.

56:39.291 --> 56:41.291
[soft music playing]

56:42.041 --> 56:43.541
-[Henry] Salud.
-Cheers to that.

56:48.666 --> 56:49.916
Oh, wow.

56:51.500 --> 56:54.333
Who was that man?

56:54.416 --> 56:56.291
-Mm...
-From the other night.

56:56.375 --> 56:59.500
Mexico City, in the bar.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
Uh...

57:02.083 --> 57:03.666
Diego's father, isn't it?

57:05.625 --> 57:08.208
Uh-huh. Yeah, he is.

57:09.291 --> 57:12.208
He looks like the kind of man
who isn't afraid of anything.

57:12.291 --> 57:13.666
-Antonio?
-Mm.

57:13.708 --> 57:15.291
He's scared of nothing...

57:16.333 --> 57:18.291
except being
with his own family.

57:20.666 --> 57:21.666
Why do you mention him?

57:23.333 --> 57:24.333
No reason.

57:28.333 --> 57:29.416
It's funny.

57:31.125 --> 57:33.000
I usually find it hard
talking to women.

57:34.750 --> 57:36.250
It's not hard.

57:36.583 --> 57:39.166
-[chuckles]
-You just have to say, "María,

57:39.250 --> 57:40.583
"you're an amazing writer

57:40.666 --> 57:42.208
-"and an incredible person."
-[chuckles]

57:42.291 --> 57:44.333
What do you mean,
you can't talk to women?

57:44.750 --> 57:46.500
Er... I don't know.

57:47.291 --> 57:49.208
I went to a same-sex
boarding school.

57:50.541 --> 57:51.916
The only woman
I've ever really known well

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
is my mother.

57:53.083 --> 57:55.166
And she died
when I was young, so...

57:55.291 --> 57:57.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

57:58.291 --> 58:00.000
And how about your father?

58:01.750 --> 58:05.208
My father was distant.

58:06.583 --> 58:08.000
Yeah. I mean, literally.

58:08.083 --> 58:10.083
He was a missionary

58:10.583 --> 58:12.125
in the Antarctic.

58:13.708 --> 58:15.375
And then he was eaten
by a seal.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
What?

58:17.083 --> 58:19.708
Or was it
dang vicious penguins?

58:21.166 --> 58:22.250
I'm kidding.

58:23.333 --> 58:26.125
You are a strange man,
Henry Copper.

58:26.208 --> 58:27.583
[soft music playing]

58:27.666 --> 58:28.708
[Henry] Erm...

58:33.333 --> 58:35.500
Back at our rooms.

58:36.416 --> 58:39.458
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we better go in then.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.791
Yeah, an early start tomorrow.

58:44.125 --> 58:45.125
[María] Hmm.

58:46.625 --> 58:47.625
[Henry sighs]

58:48.458 --> 58:49.500
Thank you.

58:50.750 --> 58:51.958
Thank you.

58:52.041 --> 58:54.458
-No, thank you.
-[chuckles]

58:54.541 --> 58:56.416
No, seriously,
it was... it was...

58:58.083 --> 58:59.083
fun.

59:00.333 --> 59:01.333
So... [chuckles]

59:02.958 --> 59:04.666
good night, Henry Copper.

59:09.666 --> 59:10.750
[in Spanish] Goodnight.

59:12.291 --> 59:13.291
[chuckles]

59:14.750 --> 59:16.208
[María mutters indistinctly,
chuckles]

59:17.125 --> 59:19.375
[soft music continues]

59:35.125 --> 59:37.083
[Max in English] Are you ready
to go home, Henry?

59:37.958 --> 59:38.958
Yeah.

59:40.083 --> 59:41.666
-Okay, let's go.
-No, no, no.

59:41.750 --> 59:42.791
Henry, give me your tablet.

59:42.875 --> 59:44.708
-Give me your tablet.
-What?

59:44.791 --> 59:47.791
How you say,
let's take one for the road.

59:48.708 --> 59:50.375
[in Spanish] On the count
of three, say "Pedro!"

59:50.458 --> 59:52.166
[in English]
One, two, three...

59:52.250 --> 59:53.791
[all] Pedro.

59:53.875 --> 59:55.083
[all laugh]

59:55.166 --> 59:56.166
[Pedro] Okay.

59:56.250 --> 59:59.500
Well, that's it.
Er, thank you.

59:59.583 --> 1:00:01.458
-[María] Okay.
-Max, Pedro.

1:00:01.583 --> 1:00:02.583
[María in Spanish] Let's go!

1:00:04.291 --> 1:00:05.541
[in English] Bye, Diego.

1:00:08.708 --> 1:00:10.458
The sky is...

1:00:11.916 --> 1:00:12.916
cloudy.

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:14.708
-Cloudy.
-Cloudy.

1:00:16.125 --> 1:00:18.625
It look...

1:00:18.708 --> 1:00:21.125
like rain.

1:00:21.208 --> 1:00:22.291
-[Max laughs]
-Very good.

1:00:27.083 --> 1:00:28.541
[Max] Okay.

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:29.916
-Goodbye, Henry.
-Adiós.

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:31.541
[in Spanish] Come on son,
get in the car.

1:00:31.625 --> 1:00:33.916
[tender music playing]

1:00:36.041 --> 1:00:37.125
[in English]
She hates goodbyes.

1:00:48.875 --> 1:00:51.125
[tender music continues]

1:01:12.958 --> 1:01:14.083
[in Spanish]
Expecting someone?

1:01:14.166 --> 1:01:15.416
[Antonio] No.

1:01:16.791 --> 1:01:18.291
For you and me.

1:01:18.375 --> 1:01:20.250
But I'm working, Antonio.

1:01:20.333 --> 1:01:22.375
María, the place is empty.

1:01:25.166 --> 1:01:28.041
-Come on, sit with me!
-Ok, fine.

1:01:30.458 --> 1:01:31.708
[sighs]

1:01:33.291 --> 1:01:38.125
So where's
your British friend?

1:01:38.666 --> 1:01:40.166
Ah! So you're watching me?

1:01:40.250 --> 1:01:41.750
I'm not watching you,
it's just social media!

1:01:41.833 --> 1:01:42.875
Yes, you're watching me!

1:01:42.958 --> 1:01:45.458
No! You open social media
and photos start to show up...

1:01:45.541 --> 1:01:46.583
[María] Uh-huh.

1:01:46.666 --> 1:01:48.083
Anyway. This is why I came.

1:01:53.041 --> 1:01:54.625
For Diego and for you.

1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:56.000
From the gig.

1:01:56.083 --> 1:01:57.375
Thank you.

1:01:58.666 --> 1:02:00.583
I'll take it off
what you owe me.

1:02:00.666 --> 1:02:03.083
[laughs] It's not that much!

1:02:03.125 --> 1:02:04.208
[María] Mm-hmm.

1:02:06.208 --> 1:02:07.500
Um...

1:02:09.375 --> 1:02:10.416
You're wearing the shirt
you had on

1:02:10.500 --> 1:02:11.750
when I first met you.

1:02:13.833 --> 1:02:15.583
And the truth is...

1:02:16.625 --> 1:02:18.708
...you look just as beautiful
and as sexy.

1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:21.916
Hmm.

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.833
Thanks for reminding me
I have no new clothes.

1:02:31.833 --> 1:02:33.541
María, how are you?

1:02:35.125 --> 1:02:36.208
Hey, María.

1:02:38.958 --> 1:02:42.916
You know
you can count on me, right?

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.416
-Mm-hmm.
-You can trust me.

1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:46.708
We're a family.

1:02:52.833 --> 1:02:54.000
[sighs]

1:02:54.833 --> 1:02:56.875
Have you ever...

1:02:59.875 --> 1:03:01.708
Have you ever had
a week where...

1:03:03.083 --> 1:03:05.125
...where everything
made sense?

1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:08.625
As if...

1:03:09.500 --> 1:03:13.250
...as if your life
was just as you dreamt it?

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:17.833
And then suddenly...

1:03:17.916 --> 1:03:20.625
...you come back
to reality and...

1:03:22.083 --> 1:03:23.416
[voice breaking] ...it's over.

1:03:25.208 --> 1:03:27.291
Nevermind, forget it.
Pretend I didn't say anything.

1:03:27.333 --> 1:03:29.250
-Hey, hey, hey...
-[María speaks indistinctly]

1:03:30.166 --> 1:03:31.166
I understand.

1:03:32.208 --> 1:03:33.958
I understand perfectly.

1:03:36.333 --> 1:03:38.541
We've all been through
moments like these.

1:03:42.500 --> 1:03:43.750
Come on!

1:03:44.166 --> 1:03:46.125
Why don't we go
somewhere else?

1:03:46.208 --> 1:03:49.666
This place is
a little depressing, isn't it?

1:03:49.750 --> 1:03:52.250
We could go somewhere else
and talk.

1:03:52.666 --> 1:03:53.791
Talk?

1:03:53.875 --> 1:03:55.416
Though not at my house

1:03:55.500 --> 1:03:58.041
because my roommates
are having another party...

1:03:58.125 --> 1:03:59.583
...and you know how it gets.

1:04:00.958 --> 1:04:03.500
Ok. Let's go to mine.

1:04:04.666 --> 1:04:07.083
But just to talk.

1:04:07.708 --> 1:04:09.625
Just to talk.

1:04:23.916 --> 1:04:25.916
[tablet ringing]

1:04:40.750 --> 1:04:42.083
-Jen.
-Henry!

1:04:42.166 --> 1:04:44.750
Oh, I am so glad I caught you.
Did you check in yet?

1:04:44.833 --> 1:04:47.541
No, my flight's been delayed.

1:04:47.625 --> 1:04:48.833
Good. Don't.

1:04:48.916 --> 1:04:50.041
-What?
-First off...

1:04:50.125 --> 1:04:51.208
"Don't"?

1:04:51.291 --> 1:04:53.416
The new edition
is doing really well.

1:04:53.500 --> 1:04:55.583
-And...
-And that makes me happy.

1:04:55.708 --> 1:04:56.750
I'm not finished.

1:04:56.833 --> 1:04:58.750
We need a new novel.

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:02.291
We want
a new Henry Copper book.

1:05:03.333 --> 1:05:04.333
Oh...

1:05:05.291 --> 1:05:06.291
What?

1:05:06.375 --> 1:05:09.083
And we need it in ten weeks.
Ahh!

1:05:09.166 --> 1:05:10.625
-Ten weeks? Jen, I...
-I know.

1:05:10.708 --> 1:05:12.375
Jen, I can't write a novel
in ten weeks.

1:05:12.458 --> 1:05:13.791
I know
it's a crazy deadline, Henry.

1:05:13.875 --> 1:05:15.000
But we figured it was doable

1:05:15.083 --> 1:05:17.916
if you did it with, um,
your translator.

1:05:19.083 --> 1:05:21.208
-M... María?
-Yes.

1:05:23.333 --> 1:05:24.458
What do you say?

1:05:27.333 --> 1:05:28.708
-Erm...
-Henry...

1:05:28.791 --> 1:05:33.333
You would... You would make
a lot of money from this.

1:05:33.416 --> 1:05:34.666
But this is my creation.

1:05:35.791 --> 1:05:37.250
-You know? It's my...
-Oh, come on, Henry.

1:05:37.375 --> 1:05:39.333
We both know
that's not totally true.

1:05:40.916 --> 1:05:42.041
Hmm?

1:05:42.125 --> 1:05:43.125
From what I understand,

1:05:43.208 --> 1:05:45.958
Ms. Rodríguez made
quite a material contribution

1:05:46.041 --> 1:05:47.166
to the new version.

1:05:47.250 --> 1:05:48.875
Mostly sex, Jen.

1:05:49.375 --> 1:05:52.500
Which was integral
to the entire storyline

1:05:52.583 --> 1:05:54.583
of the version that people
actually liked, Henry.

1:05:56.708 --> 1:05:58.833
It sounds to me
like she breathed

1:05:58.916 --> 1:06:00.375
some life into your book.

1:06:00.458 --> 1:06:01.791
She did that, all right.

1:06:01.875 --> 1:06:04.166
Look, you don't even have
to be in the same room.

1:06:05.541 --> 1:06:06.875
Wouldn't I?

1:06:06.958 --> 1:06:08.958
Unless you wanna be
in the same room, then sure.

1:06:10.291 --> 1:06:11.875
What do you think, Henry?
Come on.

1:06:15.875 --> 1:06:17.833
[bell tolling]

1:06:25.666 --> 1:06:27.833
[soft music playing]

1:06:31.458 --> 1:06:32.500
[sniffles]

1:06:35.291 --> 1:06:36.291
[mutters]

1:06:41.791 --> 1:06:44.041
[soft music continues]

1:07:10.875 --> 1:07:12.000
[camera shutter clicks]

1:07:14.958 --> 1:07:16.333
[María grunts]

1:07:16.416 --> 1:07:18.625
[whispers in Spanish]
I'll come back for breakfast.

1:07:18.708 --> 1:07:19.833
[both] OK.

1:07:20.416 --> 1:07:21.583
I'll call you.

1:07:21.666 --> 1:07:22.958
Sure.

1:07:27.375 --> 1:07:28.500
[grunts]

1:07:31.833 --> 1:07:33.791
[María on phone]
No, no, Pedro, no!

1:07:33.875 --> 1:07:36.333
I've helped you already,
I'm done!

1:07:36.791 --> 1:07:39.291
[Pedro] But María,
you'd only do half the work!

1:07:39.500 --> 1:07:41.416
Yes, and he would be getting
all the credit.

1:07:41.541 --> 1:07:44.000
[Pedro] Yes, but it's his name
that will sell the book.

1:07:44.083 --> 1:07:46.416
Credit doesn't pay your bills.

1:07:46.500 --> 1:07:49.166
Just think about it,
and then say yes.

1:07:49.250 --> 1:07:51.250
You can use my house.

1:07:51.416 --> 1:07:54.000
We both know that man
can't do it without you.

1:07:54.083 --> 1:07:56.333
[instrumental folk music
playing]

1:08:00.875 --> 1:08:03.791
Good morning,
María Fernanda Rodríguez.

1:08:04.958 --> 1:08:08.541
It's good to see you again.

1:08:08.625 --> 1:08:10.333
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm.

1:08:10.416 --> 1:08:11.708
[in English] Very good.

1:08:12.916 --> 1:08:14.708
[in Spanish]
Good morning, Mr. Copper.

1:08:14.791 --> 1:08:16.250
[in English] I'm learning,
all right?

1:08:16.333 --> 1:08:17.833
-Mm.
-I'm learning.

1:08:21.333 --> 1:08:22.375
[gasps]

1:08:22.916 --> 1:08:24.833
What have you done?

1:08:24.916 --> 1:08:26.458
She's redecorated.

1:08:26.541 --> 1:08:28.833
This is my house.

1:08:28.916 --> 1:08:31.625
There are other rooms.
This is the workspace.

1:08:31.708 --> 1:08:33.416
[Pedro] You moved
my Murano clown.

1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:35.833
You two drink
and smell the roses.

1:08:36.250 --> 1:08:37.333
I have to go now

1:08:37.416 --> 1:08:40.375
and take care of other men
who need me.

1:08:40.458 --> 1:08:41.500
Goodbye.

1:08:43.083 --> 1:08:44.333
[in Spanish] Goodbye!

1:08:45.083 --> 1:08:48.000
[in English] To another
fantastic beginning.

1:08:48.083 --> 1:08:51.250
I see good things
about to happen.

1:08:51.875 --> 1:08:54.291
[instrumental folk music
continues]

1:09:05.250 --> 1:09:06.583
-Hey.
-Hey!

1:09:06.666 --> 1:09:08.000
[in Spanish] How are you?

1:09:10.166 --> 1:09:11.958
[in English] Are you writing
without me?

1:09:14.083 --> 1:09:16.958
No. No, no, no...

1:09:17.041 --> 1:09:18.041
I'm not...

1:09:18.125 --> 1:09:19.750
I was just working
through some ideas.

1:09:19.833 --> 1:09:21.333
I was just getting started.

1:09:23.458 --> 1:09:25.875
Okay, we're gonna have
one rule.

1:09:25.958 --> 1:09:26.958
Okay.

1:09:27.041 --> 1:09:28.916
You never write without me.

1:09:30.416 --> 1:09:31.833
This is a collaboration,
do you understand?

1:09:31.916 --> 1:09:33.666
Like, we're... we're partners.

1:09:33.750 --> 1:09:36.041
I... I... I understand.

1:09:36.583 --> 1:09:38.583
A collaboration. I cannot...

1:09:39.666 --> 1:09:41.250
I cannot do this without you.

1:09:41.916 --> 1:09:45.000
So this will be
a blend of both of us.

1:09:45.083 --> 1:09:46.916
-I get it.
-Cool.

1:09:47.041 --> 1:09:48.750
So, tell me your ideas.

1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.291
Erm...

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.291
Er, well, okay.

1:09:54.958 --> 1:09:57.666
Er, I have a man
who works in a library...

1:09:57.750 --> 1:09:58.791
No.

1:09:58.875 --> 1:10:00.958
[upbeat music playing]

1:10:01.041 --> 1:10:02.916
There's an elderly vicar,
er...

1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.375
-No, very much, no.
-Well...

1:10:06.208 --> 1:10:07.958
And this woman
finds her happiness

1:10:08.041 --> 1:10:09.541
in caring for her sick mother.

1:10:09.625 --> 1:10:10.625
[gasps loudly]

1:10:10.708 --> 1:10:11.916
[imitates gagging]

1:10:12.541 --> 1:10:14.625
[whooshes, imitates grunting]

1:10:18.750 --> 1:10:20.625
You could have just said no.

1:10:21.583 --> 1:10:23.541
Let me show you some magic.

1:10:23.625 --> 1:10:26.000
-[upbeat music continues]
-[inaudible conversation]

1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.125
-...what you want.
-But it is who we...

1:10:36.208 --> 1:10:37.750
This is my book. My name is...

1:10:37.833 --> 1:10:38.916
Do the book the way...

1:10:43.291 --> 1:10:45.333
Earth calling Henry.

1:10:45.791 --> 1:10:48.125
Sorry. I was
just working through

1:10:48.208 --> 1:10:49.791
some of your ideas
from yesterday.

1:10:50.125 --> 1:10:51.125
Oh.

1:10:51.208 --> 1:10:52.625
-They're good.
-Mm.

1:10:53.791 --> 1:10:55.541
-When they stop in the road...
-Yeah.

1:10:55.625 --> 1:10:57.625
[conversation continues
indistinctly]

1:11:04.791 --> 1:11:05.833
Surprise!

1:11:06.333 --> 1:11:07.625
[speaks indistinctly]

1:11:08.208 --> 1:11:09.666
Right, how about this?

1:11:09.833 --> 1:11:12.083
What if he is in love
with her?

1:11:12.166 --> 1:11:13.166
No.

1:11:13.250 --> 1:11:15.041
-Bear with me. Bear with me.
-Uh-uh-uh.

1:11:15.125 --> 1:11:16.375
-Pap-pap-pap...
-[María gibbers]

1:11:16.458 --> 1:11:17.583
[María] No.

1:11:17.666 --> 1:11:19.416
He is in love with her
but he doesn't know it yet,

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:21.708
because he's never been
in love before.

1:11:21.791 --> 1:11:22.791
[María] Hmm.

1:11:22.875 --> 1:11:25.125
[upbeat music continues]

1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:35.666
What about her?

1:11:36.166 --> 1:11:38.541
Well, she's sure she isn't
in love with him.

1:11:38.625 --> 1:11:39.625
Yes.

1:11:39.708 --> 1:11:42.500
But actually she is in love
with him.

1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000
And they ride a bicycle? No.

1:11:49.041 --> 1:11:50.125
-It works. It works.
-No, no, no.

1:11:50.208 --> 1:11:52.000
It's not love. It's desire.

1:11:53.875 --> 1:11:56.000
[upbeat music continues]

1:12:02.208 --> 1:12:04.333
What if she wants him
and loves him?

1:12:05.041 --> 1:12:06.041
You can have both.

1:12:06.125 --> 1:12:07.250
It's just lust.

1:12:09.458 --> 1:12:12.125
[sighs] Okay, all right. Okay.

1:12:13.166 --> 1:12:15.250
Okay, let's try it
your way first,

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:16.375
and then we'll try it my way.

1:12:16.625 --> 1:12:18.000
Eh., no.

1:12:18.083 --> 1:12:19.833
I'm joking.
Let's try it your way.

1:12:20.166 --> 1:12:22.416
[music continues faintly
on speaker]

1:12:40.166 --> 1:12:41.625
-[typing]
-No.

1:12:41.708 --> 1:12:42.708
-Yeah.
-What? No.

1:12:42.791 --> 1:12:44.041
-No!
-Mm-hmm. Eeh-hee.

1:12:44.125 --> 1:12:48.125
"They looked at each other.
They were naked, magnificent.

1:12:48.208 --> 1:12:49.333
"They made l--"

1:12:49.416 --> 1:12:51.250
-No, I can't even say that.
-What's wrong with it?

1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:53.500
What's w...

1:12:54.708 --> 1:12:57.083
"They made love
like two dragons

"exploding in the flames
of a volcano."

1:13:00.958 --> 1:13:02.750
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1:13:02.833 --> 1:13:04.916
-This is the end.
-Come on.

1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.083
Yeah, this is the ending.

1:13:06.166 --> 1:13:08.541
It's not an ending.
That's not an ending.

1:13:08.625 --> 1:13:10.833
Lost in passion and dragons
exploding in a volcano.

1:13:10.916 --> 1:13:13.000
We need a powerful ending.

1:13:13.083 --> 1:13:14.875
We cannot end
with milk and cookies

1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.000
and goodnight,
Teddy in the nursery.

1:13:16.083 --> 1:13:18.375
I'm not asking
for milk and cookies.

1:13:18.458 --> 1:13:19.458
I'm not asking
for Teddy in the nursery.

1:13:19.541 --> 1:13:20.666
[Pedro] What is this?

1:13:20.750 --> 1:13:22.458
Keep working!

1:13:22.541 --> 1:13:23.958
You're nearly done.

1:13:24.041 --> 1:13:25.208
No, we are done.

1:13:25.291 --> 1:13:27.166
I can't go on
with this unreasonable man.

1:13:27.250 --> 1:13:29.208
I'm not the one
who's unreasonable.

1:13:29.291 --> 1:13:31.041
[Pedro] They split up,
they get back together,

1:13:31.125 --> 1:13:32.333
they make love. The end.

1:13:32.416 --> 1:13:35.083
It's not as simple
as that, Pedro.

1:13:36.458 --> 1:13:38.250
Love never is.

1:13:39.333 --> 1:13:41.625
-Oh, wow.
-Where are you going?

1:13:41.708 --> 1:13:42.833
To see my mother.

1:13:46.083 --> 1:13:48.916
Carnival!
I'm going to Carnival!

-It's Carnival!
-Yes!

1:13:55.083 --> 1:13:57.166
Uh-uh. No, no, come on.
Let's crack on.

1:13:57.333 --> 1:14:00.000
No, let's not "crack on,"
whatever that means.

1:14:00.083 --> 1:14:01.416
-Yes. Please...
-Let's get out.

1:14:01.500 --> 1:14:02.791
-Let's...
-No. No.

1:14:02.875 --> 1:14:04.166
Sit down and...

1:14:04.250 --> 1:14:06.083
Let's please
just finish this chapter.

1:14:07.500 --> 1:14:08.500
Okay.

1:14:15.375 --> 1:14:17.583
I think that's worked.

[both muttering indistinctly]

1:14:24.791 --> 1:14:25.791
You know what?
I hate to say it,

1:14:25.875 --> 1:14:27.791
but I think we've done enough.

1:14:28.083 --> 1:14:29.291
[María] Mm?

1:14:29.375 --> 1:14:31.750
I think...
I think we've done enough.

1:14:31.833 --> 1:14:33.333
Okay. What time is it?

1:14:33.750 --> 1:14:35.708
[gasps] No!

1:14:35.791 --> 1:14:38.208
It's too late!
Come on, the Carnival.

1:14:39.750 --> 1:14:41.416
Why didn't you
say anything before?

1:14:41.500 --> 1:14:43.166
-Because I'm not...
-Let's go.

1:14:43.250 --> 1:14:44.458
...overly fond about the idea.

1:14:44.541 --> 1:14:46.541
[María] Oh, come on. Let's go.

1:14:48.875 --> 1:14:50.833
I think we're a little late.

1:14:50.916 --> 1:14:51.916
I'd say.

1:14:52.750 --> 1:14:54.791
Look, why don't
we just go back?

1:14:54.875 --> 1:14:57.833
No! Hell, no!
We deserve a party!

1:14:57.916 --> 1:14:59.250
What party?
There's nobody here.

1:14:59.333 --> 1:15:00.875
-[both laugh]
-We are here.

1:15:00.958 --> 1:15:01.958
[man in Spanish]
Hey! Here you go!

1:15:02.041 --> 1:15:03.625
-Thank you!
-Happy Carnival!

1:15:03.708 --> 1:15:04.708
[in English] He's here.

1:15:04.791 --> 1:15:06.583
Don't drink that, though. You
don't know where it's been.

1:15:06.666 --> 1:15:08.875
No. But I know
where it's going.

1:15:08.958 --> 1:15:10.708
-Don't drink it.
-Eh, eh, eh...

1:15:10.958 --> 1:15:11.958
María?

1:15:12.625 --> 1:15:14.458
-Oh, stop. Let's go.
-[Antonio] María?

1:15:15.250 --> 1:15:16.250
[in Spanish]
How are you, Antonio?

1:15:19.583 --> 1:15:20.916
How are you?

You're the British?

-Er, yes, Henry. Hello.
-Oh, Henry.

Like, Henry Style.
Henry Potter?

Henry the Prince?

1:15:31.125 --> 1:15:33.208
Er, I think you mean Harry.

1:15:33.291 --> 1:15:34.625
Oh, whatever.

1:15:35.041 --> 1:15:36.041
Okay.

1:15:36.916 --> 1:15:37.916
Okay.

1:15:39.291 --> 1:15:40.291
[chuckles]

1:15:40.791 --> 1:15:42.375
[in Spanish] I get it now.
I get it.

1:15:42.458 --> 1:15:44.166
-[María] Mm-hmm?
-Everything you talked about

1:15:44.250 --> 1:15:46.041
in the bar...

1:15:46.125 --> 1:15:47.791
...is because you met
this English man, right?

1:15:47.875 --> 1:15:50.250
So what? You thought
that your life was going

1:15:50.333 --> 1:15:52.708
to suddenly become
marvelous and fantastic?

1:15:52.791 --> 1:15:54.041
María, you really
think this guy

1:15:54.125 --> 1:15:55.500
is going to make you a writer?

1:15:55.583 --> 1:15:56.541
No, I don't think so,

1:15:56.666 --> 1:15:58.625
because I already am a writer,
Antonio. Yes, I am.

1:15:58.708 --> 1:16:04.083
María, be realistic. He is
a writer. You work in a bar.

1:16:04.208 --> 1:16:06.208
That's it. That's reality,
whether you like it or not.

1:16:06.291 --> 1:16:07.958
I'm not saying it's fair...

1:16:08.041 --> 1:16:09.875
...but life isn't fair
and you know that very well.

1:16:09.958 --> 1:16:10.958

1:16:11.041 --> 1:16:12.625
I don't understand
what the hell you want!

1:16:12.708 --> 1:16:13.708
You do know. Stop playing,

1:16:13.791 --> 1:16:15.541
you're not a teenager anymore,
María.

[in English] Hey, where are
you going? Wait! Wait for me.

1:16:23.083 --> 1:16:24.083
[in Spanish] It's your turn

1:16:24.166 --> 1:16:25.666
to take care of Diego
on Saturday. Show up!

1:16:25.750 --> 1:16:27.541
No, no. If you want
I can pick him up right now...

1:16:27.625 --> 1:16:28.750
...so you can party!

1:17:37.083 --> 1:17:38.291
Oh, my gosh.

1:17:38.375 --> 1:17:39.375
What?

Oh, gosh.

Oh, my God.

1:17:47.125 --> 1:17:48.125
Well...

1:17:48.958 --> 1:17:50.791
Well, it's been nice
to get out of the house.

1:17:55.416 --> 1:17:56.416
You're right.

1:17:57.333 --> 1:18:01.000
Yeah. And I've actually,
actually enjoyed myself.

1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:05.458
No, you're...
you're right about the book.

1:18:07.125 --> 1:18:08.500
I didn't think
we're talking about that.

1:18:09.583 --> 1:18:10.625
We are.

1:18:11.791 --> 1:18:12.875
Passion fades.

1:18:14.041 --> 1:18:15.041
And...

1:18:16.458 --> 1:18:17.958
these two characters...

1:18:19.125 --> 1:18:20.416
deserve more.

1:18:21.458 --> 1:18:23.458
[gentle music playing]

1:18:24.041 --> 1:18:25.666
Passion is a part of love.

1:18:29.166 --> 1:18:32.250
Desire, all these things,
you know,

1:18:32.333 --> 1:18:34.166
they're all a part of love.

1:18:36.375 --> 1:18:37.500
But...

1:18:37.583 --> 1:18:38.958
But what about the mind?

1:18:40.708 --> 1:18:41.708
[imitates Henry]
What about the body

1:18:41.791 --> 1:18:43.625
in the soul's keeping?

1:18:43.708 --> 1:18:45.416
-In the soul's "kipping."
-"Kipping."

1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:46.583
[Henry chuckles]

1:18:47.750 --> 1:18:50.000
Er... Forget about that. I...

1:18:52.208 --> 1:18:54.000
I didn't even know
what I was saying.

1:18:59.833 --> 1:19:01.291
I can't find the words.

1:19:02.958 --> 1:19:04.250
You don't need words.

1:19:08.708 --> 1:19:10.958
[gentle music continues]

1:19:39.791 --> 1:19:40.833
[María] Mm!

1:19:48.333 --> 1:19:49.583
[both panting]

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.291
[Henry] Hey, wait, wait, wait.
What about Pedro?

1:19:53.708 --> 1:19:55.375
-He's not gonna come.
-How do you know?

1:19:55.458 --> 1:19:57.333
Well, you don't dress up
like that

1:19:57.416 --> 1:20:00.166
and come back home
for cocoa. Right?

1:20:00.458 --> 1:20:02.000
[both grunt softly]

1:20:06.250 --> 1:20:07.541
[María] Mm? [shrieks]

1:20:11.416 --> 1:20:12.500
[María shrieks]

1:20:25.875 --> 1:20:27.541
[door unlocks]

1:20:29.083 --> 1:20:30.500
[door opens and closes]

1:20:32.750 --> 1:20:34.750
[footsteps approaching]

1:20:36.875 --> 1:20:38.750
Method writing.

1:20:45.250 --> 1:20:47.250
[gentle music playing]

1:20:47.333 --> 1:20:49.041
[birds chirping]

1:20:52.583 --> 1:20:54.000
[María groaning softly]

1:21:09.291 --> 1:21:11.458
[gentle music continues]

1:21:22.125 --> 1:21:23.125
Morning.

1:21:25.291 --> 1:21:26.416
[in Spanish] Good morning.

1:21:33.125 --> 1:21:34.166
[María] Hmm.

1:21:35.958 --> 1:21:37.750
[in English]
Two dragons exploding

1:21:37.833 --> 1:21:40.083
in the flames of a volcano.

1:21:40.166 --> 1:21:41.208
[chuckles]

1:21:42.541 --> 1:21:43.875
-[Henry] Hm?
-[María] Mm-hmm.

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:47.750
[María sighs and grunts]

1:21:53.291 --> 1:21:57.666
Argh. I have to go and get
Diego ready for the day.

1:22:00.916 --> 1:22:01.916
Okay?

1:22:06.375 --> 1:22:07.708
[in Spanish] See you later.

1:22:10.208 --> 1:22:11.458
[exhales heavily]

1:22:25.666 --> 1:22:27.916
[gentle music continues]

1:22:40.583 --> 1:22:42.583
[Pedro humming]

1:22:51.125 --> 1:22:52.458
Good morning.

1:22:53.250 --> 1:22:55.000
[in English]
Did you sleep well?

1:22:56.333 --> 1:22:57.333
[scoffs]

1:22:57.666 --> 1:22:59.000
[resumes humming]

1:22:59.458 --> 1:23:01.666
[gentle music continues]

1:23:13.875 --> 1:23:15.458
[Pedro] Writing on your own?

1:23:16.125 --> 1:23:18.458
-She won't like that.
-[Henry] I know.

1:23:18.916 --> 1:23:22.083
I know. I'm just, er...
I just got a bit carried away.

1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:26.208
When she sees what I've done
with her ideas, I think...

1:23:26.291 --> 1:23:28.750
Ah, you better discuss it.

1:23:29.666 --> 1:23:31.250
I know. I know. I'm just...

1:23:32.833 --> 1:23:33.875
[Pedro] Mm...

1:23:33.958 --> 1:23:36.250
Or it won't end well.

1:23:40.375 --> 1:23:41.500
[cell phone chimes]

1:23:49.541 --> 1:23:51.750
[pensive music playing]

1:24:05.125 --> 1:24:06.708
[typing]

1:24:16.708 --> 1:24:17.916
[in Spanish] Hello!

1:24:19.333 --> 1:24:20.583
[in English] I'm late. I know.

1:24:21.291 --> 1:24:22.291
I'm sorry.

1:24:25.375 --> 1:24:26.666
Let's start.

1:24:37.125 --> 1:24:38.541
What's this?

1:24:42.916 --> 1:24:43.916
What's this?

1:24:47.708 --> 1:24:49.791
[somber music plays]

1:24:56.166 --> 1:24:57.291
[sighs heavily]

1:24:59.041 --> 1:25:00.333
[in Spanish]
That son of a bitch!

1:25:01.291 --> 1:25:03.000
[in English] You told me
it was over between you two.

1:25:03.083 --> 1:25:04.541
You told me he was nobody
in your life.

1:25:05.708 --> 1:25:07.166
He is nobody.

1:25:11.083 --> 1:25:13.291
And yet you believe him
before you believe me?

1:25:19.041 --> 1:25:20.250
[voice breaking]
So you don't trust me.

1:25:22.916 --> 1:25:25.208
And... And I can't trust you.

1:25:38.708 --> 1:25:39.791
[shudders]

1:25:40.250 --> 1:25:42.625
-Wait... Stop... Just...
-Leave me alone.

1:25:42.708 --> 1:25:45.125
-Leave me alone.
-Just give me a minute, okay?

1:25:46.416 --> 1:25:48.416
[sniffs, exhales heavily]

1:25:49.958 --> 1:25:51.083
Okay.

1:25:52.500 --> 1:25:53.500
Okay.

1:25:54.291 --> 1:25:55.291
Look, um...

1:25:56.583 --> 1:25:59.833
My entire life, all I ever
wanted to do is write,

1:26:00.541 --> 1:26:01.916
you know?

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.041
And instead of that,
what do I do?

1:26:04.125 --> 1:26:05.791
I take care of men.

1:26:05.875 --> 1:26:09.041
I clean and I work in a bar
for men.

1:26:10.416 --> 1:26:11.500
And then one day,

1:26:11.583 --> 1:26:14.291
Pedro asks me if I wanna
translate your book.

1:26:14.375 --> 1:26:16.333
And you know why I said yes?

1:26:17.041 --> 1:26:18.041
No.

1:26:18.125 --> 1:26:19.541
I knew I could make it better.

1:26:20.583 --> 1:26:23.041
And I did.
I... I made it better.

1:26:23.916 --> 1:26:24.916
[voice breaking]
And then I started

1:26:25.041 --> 1:26:27.666
to feel good
about myself [sobbing]

1:26:28.625 --> 1:26:30.166
for once in my life.

1:26:30.250 --> 1:26:31.625
And then we work together

1:26:31.708 --> 1:26:34.875
and I began to feel
really good about myself.

1:26:34.958 --> 1:26:37.791
And even though my name
would never be on the cover,

1:26:37.875 --> 1:26:39.916
I still felt like a writer.

1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:41.750
I thought we were a team.

1:26:43.208 --> 1:26:44.208
We are.

1:26:44.291 --> 1:26:45.750
I'm so stupid.

1:26:47.250 --> 1:26:48.250
I am.

1:26:49.875 --> 1:26:51.666
'Cause I trusted you

1:26:51.750 --> 1:26:52.875
but you don't trust me.

1:26:53.291 --> 1:26:55.250
I do trust you. Er...

1:26:56.416 --> 1:26:58.750
-Look, we are a team.
-[sighs]

1:27:00.333 --> 1:27:03.625
I shouldn't have said anything
about the photo, all right?

1:27:03.666 --> 1:27:05.458
It's not about the photo,
Henry.

1:27:05.541 --> 1:27:07.833
You finished the book
without me.

1:27:07.958 --> 1:27:10.375
It's the one thing
you promised you wouldn't do.

1:27:12.916 --> 1:27:14.083
María...

1:27:15.875 --> 1:27:17.375
Goodbye, Henry. Go home.

1:27:17.458 --> 1:27:19.750
[sentimental music playing]

1:27:44.125 --> 1:27:46.541
[sentimental music continues]

1:28:39.833 --> 1:28:41.833
[reading in Spanish
indistinctly]

1:28:49.750 --> 1:28:51.750
[sentimental music continues]

1:29:33.333 --> 1:29:34.750
[knocking on door]

1:29:36.416 --> 1:29:38.000
[Jen] Happy publication day.

1:29:38.625 --> 1:29:39.666
-Thank you.
-I could've put them

1:29:39.750 --> 1:29:41.541
in the post, but I wanted
you to see 'em first.

1:29:41.625 --> 1:29:42.625
Pants, Henry.

1:29:44.208 --> 1:29:45.708
-Sorry?
-Pants.

1:29:46.708 --> 1:29:48.541
Yes, right. Good point.

1:29:49.791 --> 1:29:50.791
Oh.

1:29:50.833 --> 1:29:53.916
I got your plane ticket
as requested.

1:29:54.041 --> 1:29:55.500
Thank you.

1:29:56.375 --> 1:29:57.666
It's on me.

1:29:58.166 --> 1:29:59.833
We booked late,
so it's a middle seat,

1:30:01.041 --> 1:30:02.500
at the back.

1:30:02.875 --> 1:30:04.083
Next to the lavatories.

1:30:04.166 --> 1:30:05.250
[chuckles]

1:30:06.375 --> 1:30:07.583
Good luck.

1:30:07.666 --> 1:30:09.791
That's... Thank you. Er...

1:30:11.041 --> 1:30:12.375
[door closes]

1:30:12.458 --> 1:30:13.541
Bye.

1:30:13.875 --> 1:30:14.916
Erm...

1:30:17.291 --> 1:30:18.333
[sighs]

1:30:22.291 --> 1:30:24.500
[soft music playing]

1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:47.250
[in Spanish] Mama!
Come with me! Quickly!

1:30:47.333 --> 1:30:48.958
What are you doing here, son?

1:30:49.041 --> 1:30:50.416
No, you have to see this!

1:30:51.333 --> 1:30:52.333
Hurry!

1:30:53.083 --> 1:30:54.791
[María] Wait! Wait, Diego!

1:30:55.333 --> 1:30:56.333
Hey! What?

1:31:00.583 --> 1:31:01.958
That's your name.

1:31:02.416 --> 1:31:04.458
-[María] Wow.
-He put your name on it!

1:31:04.541 --> 1:31:05.541
[María] Yes.

1:31:06.666 --> 1:31:08.666
-You wrote it, right?
-Yes.

1:31:08.750 --> 1:31:10.458
[Diego] Then you should
be there!

1:31:10.541 --> 1:31:11.583
It's today!

1:31:12.625 --> 1:31:13.791
Let's go!

1:31:14.458 --> 1:31:16.541
[soft music continues]

1:31:19.041 --> 1:31:20.416
[in English]
Here is your speech.

1:31:21.458 --> 1:31:22.500
I didn't write a speech.

1:31:22.583 --> 1:31:23.750
I know! I did.

1:31:26.416 --> 1:31:28.666
-It's in Spanish, Pedro.
-Sí.

1:31:28.750 --> 1:31:30.416
How do you say it in English?

1:31:30.500 --> 1:31:32.458
-Duh! [chuckles]
-[sighs]

1:31:33.583 --> 1:31:35.250
It's very easy. Just read it.

1:31:35.333 --> 1:31:36.708
[woman in Spanish]
Ladies and gentlemen.

1:31:36.791 --> 1:31:41.416
Please welcome,
Mr. Henry Copper!

1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:43.583
[audience cheering]

1:31:43.666 --> 1:31:46.083
[in English] Make it count.
Make it count.

1:31:46.833 --> 1:31:48.375
-Bravo!
-Bravo, Henry!

1:31:55.791 --> 1:31:56.791
[clears throat]

1:31:56.833 --> 1:31:59.291
[in Spanish]
Er, thank you very much.

1:32:01.833 --> 1:32:05.291
Thank you
for your warm reception.

1:32:05.375 --> 1:32:08.541
Er, I don't deserve it...

1:32:08.625 --> 1:32:10.708
...even though
I am pretty sexy...

1:32:10.791 --> 1:32:12.000
[audience laughs]

1:32:12.083 --> 1:32:13.083
Yes, he is!

1:32:14.333 --> 1:32:16.000
...for an Englishman.

1:32:16.458 --> 1:32:18.041
[Pedro encouraging]

1:32:18.125 --> 1:32:19.875
I mean it...

1:32:19.958 --> 1:32:24.000
...you should see some of us.

1:32:24.083 --> 1:32:25.791
[audience laughs]

1:32:25.875 --> 1:32:28.833
Generally, we are awful.

1:32:28.916 --> 1:32:31.000
[all laugh]

1:32:31.083 --> 1:32:33.291
-Yeah, sometimes they stink.
-Oh.

1:32:35.041 --> 1:32:36.041
Thank you.

1:32:36.125 --> 1:32:38.125
[cheers and applause]

1:32:44.208 --> 1:32:46.458
-[in English] Okay.
-Okay.

1:32:46.541 --> 1:32:47.916
First of all, Henry,

1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:51.583
I want to say what
a great book Two Hearts is.

1:32:51.666 --> 1:32:53.250
-[people cheer]
-Oh, thank you.

1:32:53.333 --> 1:32:55.625
It is, if I may say,

1:32:55.708 --> 1:32:57.916
even more powerful
than The Sensible Heart.

1:32:58.708 --> 1:33:01.333
You might even say
a big leap forward.

1:33:01.916 --> 1:33:03.750
[Henry] Yes, I mean, I agree.

1:33:04.333 --> 1:33:07.000
It is, er...
It is a better book, yes.

1:33:08.041 --> 1:33:09.208
I am confused, though.

1:33:09.291 --> 1:33:11.708
Two Hearts
is credited to yourself

1:33:11.791 --> 1:33:13.708
and to María Rodríguez.

1:33:13.791 --> 1:33:15.041
That's correct, yes.

1:33:15.125 --> 1:33:17.666
[host] So, she helped you
write it?

1:33:19.333 --> 1:33:22.000
Well, much more
than that, really. Erm...

1:33:22.125 --> 1:33:23.833
Can you be more specific?

1:33:25.333 --> 1:33:26.416
Well...

1:33:27.583 --> 1:33:29.208
María Rodríguez...

1:33:30.625 --> 1:33:33.166
She is the...
the second heart.

1:33:33.250 --> 1:33:34.666
[audience] Aw.

1:33:34.750 --> 1:33:35.750
Erm...

1:33:36.791 --> 1:33:40.541
If not for her, nobody here
would be reading this book.

1:33:41.958 --> 1:33:43.250
In fact, I would say...

1:33:44.458 --> 1:33:46.500
It might exist without me,

1:33:46.583 --> 1:33:48.833
but it wouldn't exist
without her.

1:33:48.916 --> 1:33:51.625
And this is
the same María Rodríguez

1:33:51.708 --> 1:33:53.458
who translated
The Sensible Heart?

1:33:53.541 --> 1:33:55.208
Yes, well...

1:33:56.083 --> 1:33:57.916
only, she didn't translate it.

1:33:58.500 --> 1:33:59.500
Erm...

1:34:00.125 --> 1:34:01.458
She rewrote it.

1:34:01.541 --> 1:34:03.125
[audience gasps]

1:34:03.416 --> 1:34:05.125
[in Spanish]
I knew it. I knew it!

1:34:05.208 --> 1:34:06.291
[shushing]

1:34:06.750 --> 1:34:08.458
[in English] I suppose
what I'm saying is...

1:34:09.625 --> 1:34:13.875
I wrote it, yes.
Erm, but she rewrote it.

1:34:15.166 --> 1:34:18.500
And then she rewrote me.

1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:25.416
[tender music playing]

1:34:25.500 --> 1:34:26.833
She absolutely did.

1:34:30.666 --> 1:34:31.666
She, er...

1:34:33.958 --> 1:34:35.041
You...

1:34:37.416 --> 1:34:38.791
completely rewrote me.

1:34:39.916 --> 1:34:41.458
[audience gasps]

1:34:42.083 --> 1:34:43.166
Aw...

1:34:43.250 --> 1:34:45.625
I'm sorry. I'm having
difficulty with this...

1:34:46.291 --> 1:34:47.666
understanding this phrase.

1:34:49.541 --> 1:34:51.666
Sorry. [chuckles] Erm...

1:34:51.750 --> 1:34:55.375
Well, perhaps there's
a translator in the house.

1:34:56.250 --> 1:34:57.375
Erm...

1:35:00.708 --> 1:35:01.708
I said...

1:35:02.625 --> 1:35:03.666
Er...

1:35:03.750 --> 1:35:06.166
Is there a translator...

1:35:06.250 --> 1:35:08.416
-I heard you the first time.
-[audience gasps]

1:35:08.625 --> 1:35:10.250
[in Spanish] It's her!

1:35:10.333 --> 1:35:11.625
María!

1:35:11.708 --> 1:35:12.708
[in Spanish] Hello.

1:35:14.791 --> 1:35:16.250
[María speaking indistinctly]

1:35:17.416 --> 1:35:18.416
[Henry] Erm...

1:35:20.666 --> 1:35:21.791
[in English] I was wrong.

1:35:23.375 --> 1:35:25.458
I was... I mean,
I was completely wrong.

1:35:27.166 --> 1:35:28.166
And you were right.

1:35:30.291 --> 1:35:31.625
You're an amazing woman.

1:35:31.916 --> 1:35:34.041
Er, a much better writer.

1:35:35.875 --> 1:35:37.125
And I'm an idiot.

1:35:38.666 --> 1:35:39.958
I'm an idiot.

1:35:40.958 --> 1:35:41.958
[chuckles]

1:35:42.708 --> 1:35:44.666
I'm an idiot who loves you.

1:35:44.750 --> 1:35:46.000
[all gasp]

1:35:47.666 --> 1:35:48.750
[in Spanish] Eh?
What did he say?

1:35:49.333 --> 1:35:51.166
He said he's an idiot.

1:35:51.250 --> 1:35:52.708
-Yes!
-[audience gasps]

1:35:52.791 --> 1:35:53.916
He's an idiot.

1:35:54.958 --> 1:35:56.500
[dramatic music plays]

1:35:57.666 --> 1:35:58.791
What are you doing here?

1:35:59.250 --> 1:36:00.250
[in English] Here you are.

1:36:01.416 --> 1:36:03.250
The Englishman who comes here

1:36:03.333 --> 1:36:05.750
and helps a Mexican housewife
become a star.

1:36:06.875 --> 1:36:08.833
[chuckles]
It's a lovely story.

1:36:09.333 --> 1:36:10.833
[in Spanish]
According to them,

1:36:10.916 --> 1:36:12.416
it's a lovely story, but...

1:36:13.625 --> 1:36:15.333
[in English] It's not
the whole story, right?

1:36:15.416 --> 1:36:17.500
[in Spanish] Sorry?
Who are you?

1:36:17.583 --> 1:36:18.583
[Antonio] Ah.

1:36:18.666 --> 1:36:19.666
Sorry.

1:36:19.750 --> 1:36:22.458
I'm her husband,
she's my wife!

1:36:22.541 --> 1:36:25.416
-[audience exclaims]
-It's the husband!

1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:27.750
Through common law.
It's not the same thing!

1:36:27.833 --> 1:36:29.625
This is better
than a telenovela! [laughs]

1:36:29.708 --> 1:36:30.708
And him?

1:36:31.541 --> 1:36:33.166
Who is he?
Have you asked yourselves?

1:36:33.250 --> 1:36:34.250
Eh?

1:36:34.333 --> 1:36:36.916
That Englishman has come here
and stolen my woman.

1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:38.583
[gasps, in English] Shame!

1:36:39.875 --> 1:36:41.833
[in Spanish] Are we
in the stone age or what?

1:36:43.333 --> 1:36:44.458
María, what happened?

1:36:45.708 --> 1:36:47.666
I thought
I could have you back...

1:36:47.791 --> 1:36:48.916
...and my son...

1:36:49.083 --> 1:36:51.000
...and the love of my family.

1:36:51.833 --> 1:36:56.416
And then, I open this shit
and I read page 125.

1:36:58.541 --> 1:36:59.791
"They made...

1:36:59.875 --> 1:37:02.541
...love like two dragons...

1:37:02.625 --> 1:37:05.791
...exploding in the flames
of a volcano."

1:37:05.875 --> 1:37:07.416
Hey, spoilers!

1:37:07.500 --> 1:37:09.583
No, no it's not a spoiler.

1:37:09.666 --> 1:37:12.333
It's the trash
that Henry Copper wrote

1:37:12.416 --> 1:37:14.083
about my woman.

1:37:14.166 --> 1:37:16.125
[in English]
This is your trash, man.

1:37:16.208 --> 1:37:18.708
Hey, that is not trash!
I wrote it.

1:37:18.791 --> 1:37:21.125
And it may be
a little over the top, sure,

1:37:21.208 --> 1:37:23.166
but it's still very sexy.

1:37:23.250 --> 1:37:25.583
[in Spanish]
Yes, yes, very sexy

1:37:25.666 --> 1:37:28.666
[laughs] Sexy?
This nerd? No, no...

1:37:29.166 --> 1:37:31.958
[in English] You English,
button-topped cabbage.

1:37:32.625 --> 1:37:34.166
What do you know about sexy?

1:37:34.250 --> 1:37:35.583
[María in Spanish]
Believe me, Antonio...

1:37:35.666 --> 1:37:38.166
...Henry knows a lot
about sexy.

1:37:38.250 --> 1:37:40.166
[audience] Ooh!

1:37:41.750 --> 1:37:43.333
You think because
you play the trumpet,

1:37:43.416 --> 1:37:45.416
and lounge about all day...

1:37:45.500 --> 1:37:47.208
...and never button up your
shirt, that you're a man?

1:37:47.291 --> 1:37:49.041
Is that what being a man is?

1:37:49.125 --> 1:37:51.541
Staying out, never being home,
and never being there?

1:37:51.625 --> 1:37:53.166
-[audience booing]
-No, no, no, no...

1:37:54.583 --> 1:37:56.041
That's not true, María.

1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:58.916
I've always been there
for you.

1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:00.708
A few days ago
when you were sad,.

1:38:00.791 --> 1:38:02.916
where did you cry, huh?
Here! On my shoulder!

1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:05.458
[in English] Hey, I...
I think that's enough.

1:38:05.541 --> 1:38:06.875
[Antonio] No, no, no.

1:38:06.958 --> 1:38:08.500
I'm gonna tell you
when it's enough...

1:38:09.291 --> 1:38:10.541
'cause I'm gonna kill you.

1:38:11.166 --> 1:38:12.166
No!

-[audience clamoring]
-[uptempo music playing]

1:38:17.125 --> 1:38:18.291
I think we can talk
about this.

[in Spanish] Stop him!

straight into the trash!

to translate something for me.
