WEBVTT

00:00.130 --> 00:02.664
We have lost four teachers
to budget cuts this year.

00:02.924 --> 00:04.188
We need a Jumbo Tron?

00:04.358 --> 00:06.668
No, Tami, we don't need one,
but we want one.

00:06.928 --> 00:08.086
I told Buddy Garrity

00:08.346 --> 00:11.339
I'm gonna reallocate
the Jumbo Tron funds to academics.

00:11.766 --> 00:14.676
Miss Colette,
states schools are a pipe-dream.

00:14.936 --> 00:16.943
I mean,
do you really want it like...

00:17.113 --> 00:19.014
- the whole boyfriend-girlfriend thing?
- Yes.

00:20.766 --> 00:23.143
I lost my scholarship,
and no school wants me.

00:23.403 --> 00:26.104
I will help you getting into college
and playing football again.

00:26.441 --> 00:28.565
I won't stop until you get there.

00:30.592 --> 00:32.177
Oh, my God.

00:32.348 --> 00:33.904
- Just take it off.
- I'm trying.

00:34.888 --> 00:36.522
Seriously, it's a new butt warmer,

00:36.692 --> 00:38.158
- it's already...
- Get it off!

00:40.364 --> 00:43.538
What the hell is this? I'm digging through
the couch looking for change and find this.

00:43.798 --> 00:45.254
Were you gonna tell me about it?

00:45.424 --> 00:48.136
- Letter of interest from Oklahoma, man.
- What?

00:48.306 --> 00:50.336
Wait a minute, let me see that.

00:50.947 --> 00:53.840
Tim, this is great. You didn't tell me
you were getting interest from colleges.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.134
But you're gonna
respond to this, right?

00:56.860 --> 00:59.971
- This is about the rest of you life.
- Exactly, the rest of your life.

01:00.336 --> 01:03.088
I'm gonna go get my laptop
and write a response.

01:04.694 --> 01:06.728
You and me, man,
we're going places.

01:09.435 --> 01:12.776
Listen, I want the scoreboard too
and I don't believe we'll get it.

01:13.036 --> 01:15.454
I just think that this reallocation
of these funds

01:15.624 --> 01:18.239
is actually gonna be a win
for everybody involved.

01:18.623 --> 01:21.034
But still, the people of Dillon,
they love their football.

01:21.446 --> 01:23.399
Well, you know,
I know that, I mean...

01:23.569 --> 01:26.495
That's been my life here
for so many years.

01:26.665 --> 01:30.585
And I see how great that program is...
Let's spread that around.

01:30.845 --> 01:32.587
Get the academics
on the same par.

01:32.847 --> 01:34.058
Tell the truth, though,

01:34.228 --> 01:37.345
there must have been a little tension
between you and your husband over this?

01:37.515 --> 01:39.010
You know, I feel like we both

01:39.270 --> 01:42.476
approached our marriage
and our career with a real...

01:42.837 --> 01:45.100
Real foundation of respects, so...

01:48.734 --> 01:50.304
160/100.

01:51.418 --> 01:52.422
Lorraine...

01:53.364 --> 01:55.114
We're in the danger zone.

01:55.439 --> 01:57.138
Are you taking your medication?

01:57.308 --> 01:58.738
I don't like those pills.

01:59.298 --> 02:01.583
- But I like that tie.
- Well, thank you very much.

02:01.753 --> 02:04.403
Matthew, did we turn off
the stove, honey?

02:04.735 --> 02:07.003
Yeah, the stove is off.
Wait Grandma, you need...

02:07.173 --> 02:09.407
- Why aren't you taking your pills?
- They dry out my skin.

02:09.821 --> 02:13.477
And you know as well as anyobdy,
I have always looked young for my age.

02:13.647 --> 02:16.214
Lorraine, can I just speak the man
outside just for a sec?

02:16.781 --> 02:18.717
Matthew,
I'm not even gonna refill these.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.429
This is a big problem, Matt.

02:26.968 --> 02:29.556
Look, how about
you just give me the pills...

02:29.726 --> 02:33.273
and then I'll make sure she takes it.
I can put it in her food or something.

02:33.923 --> 02:35.316
I can't legally do that.

02:36.601 --> 02:38.240
Okay, so we're supposed to just...

02:38.527 --> 02:40.029
wait for her to have a stroke?

02:40.199 --> 02:42.559
Listen, we knew this day would come.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.076
It comes for every patient
with dementia.

02:45.739 --> 02:48.037
She's no longer able to handle
her own affairs.

02:53.167 --> 02:54.397
I'm sorry, Matt.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074

03:03.783 --> 03:05.013
What are you doing?

03:05.273 --> 03:08.039
Waiting for the new edition of
the paper. It's got  my article on it.

03:08.209 --> 03:09.973
You're not supposed
to read your own press.

03:10.143 --> 03:13.646
I know. I'll make seconds to have it.
You get articles all the times.

03:14.772 --> 03:16.152
Here it is, I think.

03:33.272 --> 03:34.634
I'll get more wine.

04:33.836 --> 04:35.086
Hey, come here.

04:36.581 --> 04:39.663
Every time you go left, you loose
half the speed. What's that all about?

04:39.833 --> 04:42.443
- It's nothing.
- Is it your leg? You're in pain?

04:43.458 --> 04:46.310
- You tell me if you're in pain.
- I'm not in pain, Coach.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.892
The knee is fine,
I'm just getting used to it.

04:49.062 --> 04:50.064
Anyway...

04:50.321 --> 04:52.773
I gotta get to work.
So do you, by the way.

04:53.639 --> 04:54.714
Hey, Coach.

04:55.222 --> 04:57.667
You don't mind me asking.
What's the big plan, anyway?

04:57.837 --> 05:00.086
Don't worry about it.
You keep working on your speed,

05:00.346 --> 05:02.436
I'll work on the try-outs.
I got a lot of calls out there...

05:02.606 --> 05:05.059
Gonna be a lot of calls coming in soon,
we're gonna have to choose.

05:05.229 --> 05:06.621
So just get yourself ready.

05:06.791 --> 05:09.380
I'll take care of that.
You take care of the rest.

05:10.838 --> 05:14.467
Smash, he was on the hot list last year.
Your call, buddy, time's on.

05:14.798 --> 05:17.763
Yeah, no, his knee is fine, that's what
I'm saying, you gotta see this kid,

05:17.933 --> 05:20.440
he's got Texas Tech
written all over him.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.658
Well, no, I understand that the timing
is not exactly perfect right now.

05:26.381 --> 05:27.381
All right.

05:28.085 --> 05:30.835
All right, well,
thanks for returning the call.

05:32.301 --> 05:33.629
No luck with Smash?

05:35.809 --> 05:37.546
Well, it's not exactly the...

05:37.716 --> 05:39.834
right time for setting up
a walk on that, is it?

05:49.934 --> 05:52.356
- Morning, everybody.
- Principal Taylor?

05:52.679 --> 05:54.359
- Yes, Clant.
- Here you go.

05:54.529 --> 05:57.098
- Phones are ringing off the hook.
- Really, what about?

05:57.268 --> 05:58.269
Jumbo Tron?

05:59.106 --> 06:02.002
Well, tell 'em I said you're welcome.
Thank you.

06:03.485 --> 06:05.944
- Mayor Rodell.
- Good morning, Tami.

06:06.364 --> 06:07.820
- Hi. How are you?
- Morning.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.820
- This is a great picture.
- Thank you so much.

06:12.593 --> 06:14.944
So, to what do I owe this great...

06:15.114 --> 06:17.011
unexpected surprise?

06:17.181 --> 06:19.106
Honey, you know why we're here for.

06:19.276 --> 06:21.626
It's about
that scoreboard situation.

06:22.767 --> 06:23.767
You're new.

06:24.142 --> 06:25.481
You're excited.

06:25.815 --> 06:27.382
I appreciate that. I really do.

06:27.952 --> 06:30.649
But what has happened to you,
is that you've made a mistake.

06:30.819 --> 06:32.595
And that's okay. That's okay.

06:32.855 --> 06:35.315
Lord knows I've been there myself
in front of the whole town.

06:35.485 --> 06:37.420
But the thing to do now

06:37.590 --> 06:40.395
is to admit you made that mistake
and fix it.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.880
Well, the thing is...

06:43.696 --> 06:45.608
I haven't made a mistake,
Mayor Rodell.

06:46.139 --> 06:46.943
Really?

06:48.185 --> 06:49.734
Is that what you think?

06:49.904 --> 06:52.115
Then you're not looking
at the big picture.

06:52.531 --> 06:54.826
Because those boosters raised
that money in good faith

06:55.326 --> 06:57.120
that it was gonna be used
for a scoreboard.

06:57.380 --> 06:59.747
And it is not up to you
to make some unilateral decision

07:00.007 --> 07:02.583
to spend it any other way.
I don't give a damn what it's for!

07:03.257 --> 07:05.420
Well, actually, technically,
it is up to me

07:05.680 --> 07:08.798
according to the bylaws,
but what I find interesting is given

07:09.058 --> 07:12.596
the funding problems in this school,
given the test scores of this school,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.746
I am surprised that you
and all those boosters

07:14.916 --> 07:17.598
have not jumped right on this bandwagon,
that's what surprises me.

07:18.628 --> 07:21.878
I am really sorry to hear
that you feel that way, Tami.

07:22.164 --> 07:23.197
I really am.

07:23.545 --> 07:24.439
I just...

07:25.659 --> 07:27.400
I hope it doesn't turn ugly.

07:28.071 --> 07:29.683
For your sake, I mean.

07:32.757 --> 07:34.490
Damn, we are splurging tonight, baby.

07:35.593 --> 07:37.677
I got New York strips.

07:38.238 --> 07:40.663
Pan fried and buttered,
the way that got it tender.

07:41.152 --> 07:44.621
It's about $40 worth
of prime beef here, baby.

07:46.177 --> 07:48.796
And I wanted to talk to you
about Saturday.

07:49.056 --> 07:50.673
Joe McCoy wants us to...

07:50.843 --> 07:52.967
go out to eat.
Is that okay?

07:53.332 --> 07:54.332
Yeah, sure.

07:54.878 --> 07:56.304
I'll see if Tim can come.

07:58.809 --> 08:00.463
You know, Lyla, I don't know if...

08:00.633 --> 08:03.144
Tim Riggins is really
the right one for you.

08:03.522 --> 08:06.606
Well, he's a good guy.
He's going to college.

08:07.890 --> 08:09.570
Tim Riggins going to college

08:09.740 --> 08:12.612
is like me teaching yoga classes.
That's not gonna happen.

08:13.466 --> 08:16.115
Maybe he just needs someone to believe
in him. You ever think about that?

08:16.521 --> 08:19.660
There's been plenty of young girls
in Dillon who have believed in him.

08:20.287 --> 08:23.373
Do you understand that a dad
would not want his daugther

08:23.554 --> 08:25.391
to be with a guy
who drinks all the time

08:25.561 --> 08:28.377
and has been with half the girls
in the state of Texas?

08:28.638 --> 08:30.880
He comes with wild trash.
He's gonna bring you down.

08:33.321 --> 08:34.980
Are you using protection?

08:35.400 --> 08:36.469
Excuse me?

08:36.729 --> 08:40.181
The last thing we need
is for you to get pregnant and for us

08:40.441 --> 08:42.808
to have to raise
Tim Riggins' kid. Lyla!

08:50.623 --> 08:54.134
That craziness in my office today
with Buddy and the mayor.

08:54.886 --> 08:58.836
It was unbelievable. They were
threatening me. It was like the mafia.

09:00.190 --> 09:02.536
And I thought the mayor
would be on my side, I mean...

09:02.706 --> 09:04.664
And there's Buddy
just sitting there, like...

09:05.456 --> 09:07.875
none of this is his fault,
he doesn't know what's going on.

09:09.729 --> 09:12.528
These people are acting like
I've done the worst thing in the world.

09:12.698 --> 09:15.758
Like it's terrible for everybody.
What is everybody thinking?

09:16.522 --> 09:17.885
What do you think I should do?

09:23.239 --> 09:24.375
I'll get her.

09:25.191 --> 09:27.116
- Honey.
- I got it, go to bed.

09:28.197 --> 09:30.231
Hey, I'm Tyra Colette,
vote for me.

09:30.672 --> 09:32.107
Vote for Tyra.

09:32.544 --> 09:34.985
Okay, so hand me
about half these flyers

09:35.155 --> 09:38.215
and I'm gonna hang some out in the quad.
You're gonna be wonderful.

09:38.385 --> 09:39.905
That's not that funny.

09:40.075 --> 09:42.325
- Vote for Tyra!
- It's not that funny...

09:43.587 --> 09:45.788
There are not one person
who saw who did this?

09:46.209 --> 09:48.040
- Nobody saw who did this?
- What's going on?

09:48.754 --> 09:51.335
Oh, nothing,
it's just a little situation here.

09:51.595 --> 09:53.629
I'm gonna handle it.
Don't worry about it.

09:53.992 --> 09:56.132
- It's fine, I'll handle it.
- Landry!

10:08.858 --> 10:10.521
Okay, all right.
Just go to class.

10:11.551 --> 10:14.400
Tyra, I'm sorry this happened,
but I'm not sure what you want me to do.

10:14.660 --> 10:17.987
I got into this race late. I need to get
my face out there. I can't do it like that.

10:18.247 --> 10:19.656
I do know this.

10:19.954 --> 10:22.771
Jenny Warwick started working
on her campaign 3 weeks ago,

10:22.941 --> 10:24.937
not the night before deadline.

10:25.582 --> 10:28.130
You can't get into the race late,
and half fast,

10:28.300 --> 10:29.749
and expect people to respect you.

10:32.916 --> 10:36.589
Either she's completely in charge
of herself or she's non-<i>compos mentis</i>.

10:37.078 --> 10:40.344
- I don't know what that means.
- A legal term for when you lose it.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.490
That's why I'm suggesting
you become her guardian.

10:42.660 --> 10:45.035
No, I don't want
to become her guardian.

10:45.205 --> 10:47.767
She's my guardian, okay?
I'm 17.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.830
You could become
an emancipated minor,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.016
then you could assume legal guardianship
over your grandmother's affairs.

10:56.186 --> 10:59.444
That way, you'd have complete control
over her financial matters...

10:59.614 --> 11:01.864
I don't wanna be
in control of all that, okay?

11:02.124 --> 11:04.075
I'm trying
to go to college next year.

11:05.072 --> 11:06.453
What about your dad?

11:06.623 --> 11:08.033
He's in Iraq, right?

11:08.391 --> 11:10.372
Is he coming home anytime soon?

11:11.931 --> 11:14.048
I don't know...
I don't think so.

11:14.849 --> 11:17.052
Well, I suppose
we could put her in a home.

11:17.222 --> 11:18.918
Let State take care of her.

11:19.647 --> 11:20.967
I'm not doing that.

11:21.864 --> 11:24.512
Listen, hey...
I'm just giving you your options.

11:24.862 --> 11:27.556
You know, you came in here and...
it seemed pretty urgent.

11:29.009 --> 11:32.103
Here is the paperwork to become...

11:32.614 --> 11:34.287
an emancipated minor.

11:34.595 --> 11:36.211
If you decide to do it,

11:36.540 --> 11:38.568
you can track down your dad
and have him sign.

11:45.601 --> 11:46.974
Come on, let's go!

11:48.990 --> 11:51.580
Oh, come on, man!
You got a big game tomorrow!

11:54.593 --> 11:55.668
Just whacked you up.

11:56.032 --> 11:58.796
Hey, guys! I got a little kid home
who'd like to see me today!

12:02.455 --> 12:03.455
That's it!

12:04.844 --> 12:06.429
Damn, Rig, what the hell, man?

12:07.071 --> 12:08.264
What did you hit me for?

12:08.755 --> 12:10.558
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:11.299 --> 12:13.728
I pushed you Williams,
you gotta relax, man!

12:14.686 --> 12:16.340
You know what?
Just forget it!

12:16.510 --> 12:19.034
I don't even know
what we're doing out here, anyway!

12:21.950 --> 12:23.654
What do you do?
Where are you going?

12:30.307 --> 12:32.476
All right, grandma. I really...
Look, we're gonna just...

12:32.646 --> 12:35.541
We gonna try taking these pills, okay?
I know you don't want to, but...

12:35.801 --> 12:38.210
I can't take that. It makes my face
look like mummies or so.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.075
Well, you know what a stroke
will make your face look like?

12:41.245 --> 12:44.633
I'm not gonna have a stroke. I don't
even know anybody who's had a stroke.

12:45.843 --> 12:47.553
Grandma,
if you don't take these pills...

12:48.324 --> 12:50.014
You leave me alone about the pills.

12:53.533 --> 12:54.942
I'll be right back.

13:09.701 --> 13:10.701
Sorry...

13:17.203 --> 13:18.204
You...

13:19.313 --> 13:20.693
You work here now?

13:22.073 --> 13:24.548
Yeah, I work at Applebee's...

13:25.363 --> 13:27.301
God, you got a name tag
and everything, uh?

13:28.610 --> 13:31.680
Yeah, I'm very official.
I'm just saving it for a car.

13:33.060 --> 13:37.019
So... why are you kicking
the crap out of the boxes?

13:38.173 --> 13:41.232
It's my grandma. She refuses
to take her blood pressure medication.

13:42.028 --> 13:43.431
Why isn't she taking it?

13:43.601 --> 13:46.278
Because she thinks
that if she takes it, it's going to

13:46.538 --> 13:48.521
dry her skin out
and make her look like a mummy.

13:48.691 --> 13:51.944
And the doctor can't legally
give me her medication to...

13:52.114 --> 13:54.370
you know, to give to her
because I'm not her legal guardian.

13:55.590 --> 13:58.793
And I can't be her legal guardian
unless I become an emancipated minor,

13:58.965 --> 14:02.013
and in order to become an emancipated
minor, I'd have to have my dad sign...

14:02.183 --> 14:05.022
some piece of paper but unfortunately,
my dad's in Iraq right now,

14:05.192 --> 14:08.676
he's not sitting around by a fax,
so I can't get him to sign anything.

14:10.734 --> 14:11.840
So...

14:12.077 --> 14:15.182
Would now be a bad time to tell you
your grandma is yelling at the cooks

14:15.375 --> 14:17.393
- to make her chocolate pudding.
- Are you serious?

14:18.129 --> 14:19.194
No, no!

14:19.423 --> 14:21.439
No, I'm just...
I'm joking.

14:22.710 --> 14:25.349
I'm sorry,
I was trying to be funny.

14:25.787 --> 14:27.027
That was rude.

14:27.947 --> 14:29.262
Yes, it was.

14:30.771 --> 14:32.418
But it was kind of funny.

14:39.176 --> 14:41.167
Yeah, well...
I gotta get back to work.

14:41.571 --> 14:43.461
- It was good seeing you.
- You too.

14:44.646 --> 14:48.630
Would you mind, like, kind of piling
the boxes back where you found them?

14:49.688 --> 14:50.761
Thank you.

14:57.605 --> 14:58.634
Oh, yeah...

15:00.665 --> 15:03.314
Take it off...
Take it off, come on.

15:03.706 --> 15:05.483
Lyla, I know how to dress myself.

15:05.744 --> 15:08.319
No, you only know how to put on
a pledge shirt one button per button.

15:09.399 --> 15:10.865
You know what'd be great?

15:11.035 --> 15:14.419
We just leave, cause I don't even wanna
go to this dinner in the first place.

15:14.589 --> 15:16.618
Yeah, well, if you only did
what you wanted to do,

15:16.788 --> 15:19.522
your life would be all about football,
beer and sex, wouldn't it?

15:19.692 --> 15:21.659
And what's the problem with that?

15:22.468 --> 15:25.905
It's just a good opportunity for you
to spend some time with my dad.

15:26.163 --> 15:28.766
And Mr. McCoy went
to Oklahoma, so he...

15:29.273 --> 15:33.052
- might be able to help you out.
- Basically, you want me to smooth him.

15:33.450 --> 15:35.825
No, I don't want you
to smooth anybody. I just...

15:35.995 --> 15:39.287
You guys just gonna,
you know, talk about football.

15:39.786 --> 15:43.297
- Not a big deal.
- I hate this, and I don't wanna go.

15:43.467 --> 15:45.444
You don't even know
what you're saying you hate.

15:45.614 --> 15:49.397
You just gonna go to dinner
with a guy who loves football, who...

15:49.650 --> 15:53.239
might actually be able to help you out
and there's nothing more to it.

15:55.571 --> 15:56.575
Come on...

15:59.382 --> 16:00.384
You...

16:01.313 --> 16:03.416
wanna tell me the real reason

16:03.959 --> 16:05.376
why we're doing this?

16:06.004 --> 16:07.026
Because...

16:08.349 --> 16:09.773
I care about you.

16:11.454 --> 16:14.479
And you wanna know
why <i>I'm</i> doing this?

16:15.845 --> 16:17.611
Because you care about me?

16:19.101 --> 16:20.374
Maybe just a bit.

16:21.418 --> 16:22.418
Thank you.

16:22.927 --> 16:24.272
How about...

16:24.694 --> 16:28.691
"A vote for Tyra
is a vote for hotness?"

16:29.423 --> 16:32.393
Landry, I'm serious here.
I'm trying to be a serious person.

16:32.563 --> 16:35.030
How is that not serious?
I'm trying to help you out.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.715
How about "Vote Tyra...

16:40.578 --> 16:43.227
- "and get action?"
- Hell, yeah!

16:44.137 --> 16:47.778
- I didn't realize it was gonna sound...
- How about nothing about action or hotness?

16:47.948 --> 16:50.217
Well, why not, honey?
You're such a gorgeous girl.

16:50.387 --> 16:53.632
I mean, I always say
"smoke him if you got him", that's all!

17:19.960 --> 17:22.911
Seriously, all right, back off!
Knock it off!

17:23.547 --> 17:26.999
I want you all off the campus
in one minute or I'm calling the police.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.502
- That's a little extreme, Mr. Trucks...
- The party's over, ladies.

17:30.762 --> 17:31.861
What's going on?

17:32.031 --> 17:34.548
Jenny's mom was here yesterday
helping her to hand out cupcakes,

17:34.808 --> 17:37.092
I don't understand why I can't have
some friends helping me.

17:37.352 --> 17:39.845
- Mrs. Colette, are you really that dumb?
- Hey, watch it.

17:40.270 --> 17:42.890
Just give me a moment here, Mrs. Taylor.
Do I have to explain to you

17:43.150 --> 17:46.381
the difference between Jenny's mom
and 4 dancers from the <i>Landing Strip</i> ?

17:46.551 --> 17:48.979
Back to class right now.
Right now, you all!

17:49.239 --> 17:52.089
Did you hear what Mrs. Taylor said?
Clear out!

17:53.684 --> 17:55.171
What are you doing?

17:55.593 --> 17:58.405
- I'm helping my campaign.
- You are suspended

17:58.826 --> 18:00.950
- 3 days, starting now.
- Wait a minute...

18:01.210 --> 18:02.982
- Wait, no!
- Hold on, hold on.

18:03.152 --> 18:05.786
Listen, I'm...
Let me deal with this, all right?

18:05.956 --> 18:08.290
- You gonna deal with it?
- Yes, I'm taking care of it. Tyra...

18:09.147 --> 18:12.723
Go get ready for that meeting and
I'm gonna discuss this with you later.

18:12.893 --> 18:14.353
Thanks, Mrs. T.

18:15.269 --> 18:18.342
You're letting her get away with this?
You have got to be kidding me.

18:21.927 --> 18:24.861
I need two more burgers well done
with Alamo sauce.

18:25.031 --> 18:28.727
After that, I need you to mob the floor
in the back, I ain't staying late tonight.

18:28.987 --> 18:30.081
Yeah, fine.

18:30.990 --> 18:33.399
Hey, Coach, what's the matter?

18:33.893 --> 18:36.026
Give you a crispy chicken sandwich
for the game?

18:36.573 --> 18:38.497
I've been calling
every school I can think of

18:38.667 --> 18:41.515
telling them that Smash Williams
is on a full recovery,

18:41.894 --> 18:45.839
that he's ready to play college ball.
You tell me, should I not be doing that?

18:48.879 --> 18:50.502
I don't know what it is.

18:51.482 --> 18:53.502
I've never been scared once
playing football.

18:54.178 --> 18:57.548
Even after Jason Street, I just...
I played like nothing could touch me.

18:58.332 --> 19:00.220
Look, it's not just the knee...

19:00.928 --> 19:02.394
I mean, it is, but...

19:03.632 --> 19:05.222
I know you think
I can be who I was.

19:05.756 --> 19:08.831
But I think I was only great
cause I was a Dillon Panther.

19:09.385 --> 19:11.311
I was part of something
bigger than myself.

19:11.867 --> 19:15.006
The team needed me to be great, so...
I was great.

19:15.772 --> 19:18.777
Now, I'm just a guy playing by myself
on my old high school field.

19:19.388 --> 19:20.897
And let's be honest...

19:21.169 --> 19:23.157
you're having a hard time
finding a try-out for me.

19:24.573 --> 19:25.909
I'll get you a try-out.

19:30.614 --> 19:33.375
Suck it up.
That's what being a man is.

19:33.775 --> 19:37.171
I wanna see you over Hermann Field
at 8 o'clock, Saturday night, full pants.

19:38.674 --> 19:40.132
Don't you be late on me.

19:48.745 --> 19:50.585
And I'd also like to remind everyone

19:50.755 --> 19:53.187
that with two years student government
experience under my belt,

19:53.997 --> 19:57.361
I understand what is required
and I'm ready to lead.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.873
This is a question for Tyra.

20:08.043 --> 20:11.955
Can you explain for those of us who are
concerned about your lack of experience,

20:12.674 --> 20:14.376
how you could turn this
into a positive

20:14.546 --> 20:17.419
when acting as a liaison
between the students and the faculty?

20:18.236 --> 20:21.882
Wow, that was a long question.
I don't think I remember half of it.

20:22.822 --> 20:26.762
No, seriously, y'all. What this entire
election really boils down to

20:27.377 --> 20:30.724
is who you want planning your prom,
and one thing I can tell you

20:31.260 --> 20:35.208
is that nobody here is getting laid
if you let Jenny here

20:35.378 --> 20:38.083
have our prom in the gym, okay?

20:45.065 --> 20:48.367
<i>Wow, oh my...
Is this a Panther's cakewalk or what?</i>

20:48.628 --> 20:50.828
<i>The Panthers hold
the commanding lead,</i>

20:51.088 --> 20:53.080
<i>42 to 0 over the Laribee Lions.</i>

20:53.341 --> 20:55.811
<i>And how about a little
icing for that cake?</i>

20:56.155 --> 20:57.750
<i>Saracen's under the center.</i>

20:58.894 --> 21:00.299
<i>He takes the snap.</i>

21:00.632 --> 21:02.713
<i>He screens right to Riggins
in the midfield.</i>

21:02.975 --> 21:04.602
<i>He's to the forty, he's got room!</i>

21:04.772 --> 21:07.422
<i>He picks up a good block
for forty to the tenth!</i>

21:07.592 --> 21:09.136
<i>Touchdown, Tim Riggins!</i>

21:09.397 --> 21:12.808
<i>Oh, boy, the Panthers
have this one in hands.</i>

21:28.457 --> 21:30.596
Coach, good game.
Good game.

21:30.766 --> 21:32.923
Craig, how you doing?
Good to see you.

21:33.093 --> 21:35.843
When are we gonna see
that J.D. McCoy kid play?

21:37.847 --> 21:40.286
- Matt had a hell of a game.
- Yeah.

21:41.226 --> 21:42.628
I hear what you're saying.

21:44.666 --> 21:47.198
All right, good nap, enjoy tonight.

21:50.941 --> 21:52.719
He didn't even acknowledge me.

21:53.451 --> 21:55.651
And Karen O'Day is not making
eye contact with me,

21:55.821 --> 21:58.270
it's like all these people hate my guts,
what's wrong on with them?

21:58.723 --> 21:59.797
It's craziness.

21:59.967 --> 22:01.981
People love football,
you're not gonna change that.

22:02.151 --> 22:03.192
I know that

22:03.452 --> 22:07.440
and I also know they're not thrilled
about the loss of their big Jumbo Tron.

22:07.610 --> 22:09.656
- Did they change this menu?
- You know what, hon?

22:09.916 --> 22:11.707
I need you to weigh in,
cause at this point,

22:11.877 --> 22:14.995
I'm feeling like this world's against me
and I'm wondering which side you're on.

22:15.165 --> 22:17.867
Honey, I don't wanna weigh in
on this situation right now,

22:18.037 --> 22:21.084
because I don't wanna tell my wife
who I love and who I believe in,

22:21.936 --> 22:23.045
a hundred percent,

22:23.681 --> 22:26.678
that the first major decision
that she made at that school,

22:26.848 --> 22:28.965
could be construed by some...

22:30.832 --> 22:32.155
as questionable.

22:33.154 --> 22:35.806
It's risky, yeah, I mean...
And courageous.

22:36.373 --> 22:38.248
Questionable?
Come on, Hon...

22:38.418 --> 22:41.414
You know what? I don't care about
the damn Jumbo Tron. I really don't.

22:41.584 --> 22:43.899
But let me tell you something,
Buddy Garrity and the boosters,

22:44.604 --> 22:48.103
if they want that damn Jumbo Tron,
they are gonna get that damn Jumbo Tron.

22:48.273 --> 22:49.820
And the hell with the rest of them,

22:49.990 --> 22:52.366
- but you knew that from the get-go.
- Well, yes.

22:52.917 --> 22:56.251
The only people who have the money
are the boosters and Buddy Garrity,

22:56.421 --> 22:58.895
and I love they want
the football program to flourish

22:59.065 --> 23:01.832
but I just think that they need to be
told if they want that to flourish,

23:02.002 --> 23:04.351
they need to give a tiny,
tiny bit to academics.

23:04.521 --> 23:07.338
Baby, there is a big difference
between tiny, tiny and Jumbo Tron.

23:07.758 --> 23:09.460
This is the way change is made

23:09.630 --> 23:12.678
and I felt like I needed to make
that statement right from the beginning.

23:12.938 --> 23:15.096
Honey, you made it clear,
and you made your statement.

23:17.911 --> 23:19.234
Well, I know...

23:19.627 --> 23:22.104
there is a new episode
of <i>Cagney and Lacy</i> on.

23:22.274 --> 23:25.607
There's not any new ones on,
this show is not on anymore.

23:26.157 --> 23:27.985
That was a good show, I don't know

23:28.245 --> 23:31.947
why they quit those good shows
and put these other shows on.

23:32.491 --> 23:33.528
All right...

23:34.013 --> 23:35.992
I'll watch whatever this is.

23:36.552 --> 23:39.704
- Is that milk about ready, honey?
- Yeah, this is ready, it's on its way.

23:40.300 --> 23:41.766
Oh, thanks.

23:42.860 --> 23:44.501
I saw that game.

23:45.026 --> 23:46.464
You played great.

23:47.131 --> 23:48.463
You just played great.

23:49.089 --> 23:52.435
- Thanks.
- You've always loved football, Matty.

23:53.048 --> 23:54.552
I remember when you were 2,

23:54.722 --> 23:57.097
you were trying to throw a football
bigger than you were.

23:58.256 --> 24:01.726
And you were such a sweet baby.
Such a sweet, sweet baby.

24:03.913 --> 24:06.102
But here you are, all grown-up...

24:06.803 --> 24:08.567
taking care of everything.

24:10.478 --> 24:12.695
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

24:14.793 --> 24:16.030
I don't know.

24:17.203 --> 24:19.778
Matthew, I love you.

24:21.430 --> 24:24.081
I know, I love you too, grandma.

24:24.719 --> 24:25.720
Grandma...

24:34.004 --> 24:35.638
You are such a good boy.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.573
That's cause I was raised by you.

24:37.743 --> 24:38.802
Thank you...

24:39.524 --> 24:40.604
Thank you.

24:59.996 --> 25:01.162
Okay, okay...

25:02.950 --> 25:04.498
Can I help you with something, Matt?

25:05.101 --> 25:06.851
I need to borrow your car.

25:08.178 --> 25:09.877
Why do you need
to borrow my car, Matt?

25:10.254 --> 25:12.823
Okay, look. I just borrow it,
and it'll be back in the morning,

25:12.993 --> 25:15.508
You don't even have to know
that it was gone.

25:17.248 --> 25:18.249
Please.

26:32.225 --> 26:33.469
It's me, Matt.

26:34.993 --> 26:36.001
Your son.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.213
Matt?

26:51.022 --> 26:53.023
- Look at you.
- Look. I just need you...

26:54.090 --> 26:55.914
to sign these papers, please.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.507
What's this?

27:03.515 --> 27:07.513
I need to become an emancipated minor
so I can take care of grandma legally.

27:09.008 --> 27:11.583
Lorraine?
Where's Henry?

27:14.049 --> 27:15.257
He's in Iraq.

27:17.154 --> 27:20.175
I don't wanna talk about all the things,
so if you could just sign those, please.

27:20.967 --> 27:22.920
- You wanna come inside?
- No.

27:23.842 --> 27:24.858
Okay.

27:26.951 --> 27:28.349
Hang on a second.

27:29.046 --> 27:31.394
- What are you doing?
- It's just... I can't...

27:31.654 --> 27:34.146
I'm not gonna sign anything
that I haven't read, so...

27:40.846 --> 27:42.663
What's wrong with Lorraine?

27:44.522 --> 27:48.198
She's got dementia. She can't
really take care of herself anymore.

27:49.281 --> 27:51.135
And Henry left you alone with her?

27:51.305 --> 27:54.194
I don't think you really
are in position to judge.

27:59.358 --> 28:00.381
You got a pen?

28:04.085 --> 28:04.885
Yeah.

28:07.364 --> 28:08.264
Come in.

28:10.075 --> 28:11.376
Did you hear?

28:12.185 --> 28:16.184
You are looking at the new president
of the Dillon High student body.

28:17.831 --> 28:20.771
- I heard.
- And they said it couldn't be done.

28:21.956 --> 28:23.828
Can I help you with something?

28:24.314 --> 28:25.657
What's the matter?

28:26.583 --> 28:30.077
You know you sank to the lowest comment
and nominator to win that election.

28:32.467 --> 28:33.484
No, I...

28:34.400 --> 28:35.710
Mr. Trucks, he made it...

28:35.880 --> 28:38.712
Don't you even go
blame it on Mr. Trucks!

28:39.713 --> 28:42.744
It is time for you to start
taking responsibility for your life.

28:43.183 --> 28:45.588
Well, Mrs. T.,
I was just doing what I though I had to.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.646
And when I was standing
out there in that quad

28:47.816 --> 28:51.036
watching you make an idiot out of
yourself and everybody around you,

28:51.206 --> 28:53.685
I did what I thought I had to do
by sticking up for you.

28:54.229 --> 28:55.895
Because I have believed in you.

28:56.460 --> 28:59.941
Now, I suggest you would better start
earning back your self-respect

29:00.493 --> 29:02.868
and the faith
that I once had in you,

29:03.383 --> 29:05.572
or you really will be on your own.

29:07.552 --> 29:09.061
Go and get to class.

30:00.642 --> 30:02.629
- You're ready ?
- Oh yeah!

30:08.186 --> 30:09.636
All right. Bring it back.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.223
- 26 to count.
- All right, you all heard the man.

30:13.483 --> 30:14.474
On one. Ready?

30:22.533 --> 30:24.567
- You all right?
- Lucky hit, Rig.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.945
- Lucky.
- All right.

30:27.793 --> 30:29.406
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

30:32.233 --> 30:33.363
Same play.

30:34.911 --> 30:36.371
Set. Hut!

30:52.184 --> 30:53.770
Smash, you okay, man?

30:55.400 --> 30:57.142
I didn't mean to hit the knee.
You okay?

30:59.113 --> 31:00.437
Smash, get up, baby.

31:07.085 --> 31:09.863
Hey, 6!
I'm back, baby!

31:11.520 --> 31:13.908
- The Smash is back!
- There you are, man.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.622
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Yeah, you gonna be fine.

31:28.792 --> 31:33.153
I'll just chat him up about playing
with Bosworth at Oklahoma, and then...

31:33.638 --> 31:35.588
How the hell do you know that?

31:35.761 --> 31:36.980
Google, why?

31:39.427 --> 31:41.177
I didn't know you google.

31:41.583 --> 31:44.063
- I'm not retarded, I google.
- I know, but...

31:44.233 --> 31:46.501
Sometimes,
you pretend you are, so...

31:46.817 --> 31:49.319
Oh, my God!

31:49.579 --> 31:52.968
Buddy Garrity, look at your dau...

31:53.308 --> 31:54.955
You are just a vision!

31:55.125 --> 31:57.275
And you, are you sure she's yours?

31:58.629 --> 32:00.330
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

32:00.688 --> 32:02.165
- This is Tim.
- How are you?

32:02.648 --> 32:04.792
- Nice to meet you.
- Joe McCoy, good to see you.

32:06.344 --> 32:08.879
- What up, man, how is it going?
- Good.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.466
- So, Melany, we all here.
- Right this way.

32:20.742 --> 32:21.808
Two things.

32:22.487 --> 32:24.529
I don't like you with my daughter,

32:24.982 --> 32:26.932
the reason should be obvious.

32:27.235 --> 32:31.024
Two,
my relationship with Joe McCoy

32:31.194 --> 32:32.904
is extremely important.

32:33.606 --> 32:36.491
You do not jeopardize it
in any way,

32:37.410 --> 32:38.863
or I will hurt you.

32:48.699 --> 32:50.613
Joe, that is nice.

32:50.783 --> 32:52.674
Thank you.
That's my anniversary present.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.217
That's beautiful.

32:54.659 --> 32:56.678
Yeah, that was a bargain.

32:59.398 --> 33:02.058
Tim, I understand that
you have switched positions this year

33:02.318 --> 33:03.525
to tailback?

33:04.833 --> 33:06.688
How is that working out for you?

33:09.242 --> 33:11.423
Thinking about college
for next year?

33:17.188 --> 33:19.158
- Are we ready to order?
- Sure.

33:21.064 --> 33:24.141
- The Texas Game Sampler, please.
- Texas Game Sampler.

33:24.311 --> 33:27.161
- And you, Ma'am?
- I'll have the same, please.

33:27.824 --> 33:30.320
- And for you, sir?
- You still have the porterhouse?

33:30.490 --> 33:31.652
But it's not on menu.

33:31.822 --> 33:34.424
That's what I want.
I want that big porterhouse,

33:34.923 --> 33:36.676
just have Wayne cut me one.

33:37.466 --> 33:39.316
- Medium rare.
- Yes, sir.

33:39.986 --> 33:41.264
And for you, sir?

33:42.869 --> 33:44.225
All look so good.

33:45.462 --> 33:46.912
Let's go with the...

33:47.400 --> 33:49.272
Let's go with the squab, tonight.

33:49.532 --> 33:51.065
Honey, are you sure?

33:51.591 --> 33:52.701
Yes, ma'am.

33:53.287 --> 33:54.982
Okay, well then... Go.

33:56.108 --> 33:58.823
Can I get that...
Let's get that rare, as well, please.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.371
One rare squab.

34:04.122 --> 34:05.425
Thank you, sir.

34:16.534 --> 34:18.781
- What happened in there?
- What do you mean?

34:18.951 --> 34:21.675
Mr. and Mrs. McCoy were asking you
a bunch of questions,

34:21.844 --> 34:23.556
you didn't say anything,
you were rude.

34:24.158 --> 34:27.643
Did I not give you heads up that I hate
those restaurants, those people,

34:27.904 --> 34:29.145
the food was sick.

34:29.536 --> 34:31.648
Yeah, well,
you ordered rare pigeon.

34:33.652 --> 34:34.803
You know what?

34:35.315 --> 34:37.195
Who are you trying
to turn me into, right now?

34:37.518 --> 34:39.237
I'm not trying
to turn you into anything.

34:39.498 --> 34:41.489
- Are you sure about that?
- I'm positive.

34:41.751 --> 34:45.118
I'm trying to make you into someone
who doesn't order rare squab.

34:45.379 --> 34:46.889
I'm a horrible person.

34:48.164 --> 34:51.060
Maybe I'm just too simple
of a guy for you, Lyl'.

34:53.670 --> 34:56.139
I'm too simple,
I'm not classy enough for you.

34:56.309 --> 34:58.172
That's right.
That's what it is.

34:58.342 --> 35:01.502
- Maybe we should just go separate ways.
- Maybe we should.

35:02.858 --> 35:04.557
- Good.
- Great.

35:30.468 --> 35:31.905
- Hi, Tami.
- How you doin'?

35:32.075 --> 35:34.252
I'm fine.
Can we talk for just a second?

35:34.828 --> 35:37.134
Yeah, as long as it's not
about the Jumbo Tron thing,

35:37.304 --> 35:39.818
because I don't wanna talk about that
on my time off.

35:39.988 --> 35:43.156
Well, it is
about the Jumbo Tron, because...

35:43.735 --> 35:45.596
Quite frankly, Tami,
just let me say this.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.430
That issue has not been
put to bed, yet.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.419
We had a meeting,
with the superintendent.

35:51.589 --> 35:53.019
The funds are frozen.

35:53.189 --> 35:55.042
Who had a meeting?

35:55.435 --> 35:56.774
Well, the boosters,

35:57.308 --> 35:59.110
and the mayor,
and the superintendent,

35:59.538 --> 36:02.864
and all the people I've been out trying
to get money from, for the Jumbo Tron.

36:03.777 --> 36:04.782
And so, anyway,

36:05.042 --> 36:07.717
the hearing will be in 2 weeks,
it's open to the public,

36:07.887 --> 36:10.746
you could be there of course,
everybody avows their opinion.

36:11.007 --> 36:13.291
And we'll see what we do
at that time.

36:17.701 --> 36:19.722
I'm sorry it happens this way.

36:20.167 --> 36:21.616
It's gonna be okay.

36:22.540 --> 36:23.551
Bye.

36:26.946 --> 36:28.556
What's that all about?

36:33.570 --> 36:35.389
Hey, Mitch, how you doin'?

36:56.957 --> 36:59.044
- Coach Taylor.
- Hey, Corina.

36:59.214 --> 37:02.215
- How you doin'?
- Fine. I'm sorry to come by so late...

37:02.475 --> 37:04.300
That's okay. Come on in.
Brian!

37:04.904 --> 37:06.756
- Yeah, mama?
- Come here!

37:11.926 --> 37:13.059
What's up, Coach?

37:13.999 --> 37:15.686
You and I have some work to do.

37:16.873 --> 37:18.064
2 weeks time.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.551
You got a walk on Texas A&M.

37:23.046 --> 37:24.049
Yes, sir.

37:24.782 --> 37:26.072
I'll make you proud.

37:30.780 --> 37:33.079
- See you tomorrow morning.
- Yes, sir.

37:34.754 --> 37:35.777
Hey, kid.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.043
- Good night.
- Thank you.

37:39.771 --> 37:40.837
Thank you, Coach!

37:59.805 --> 38:00.815
Somebody died?

38:05.178 --> 38:07.989
- Why are you here?
- Mandy had to drop something off.

38:08.789 --> 38:11.886
So, as soon as they're done humping,
I'm out of your hair.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.574
Well, that shouldn't take too long.

38:14.744 --> 38:17.194
You think?
I've been here long enough.

38:17.476 --> 38:18.959
Why are you dressed like that?

38:19.129 --> 38:22.078
I'm dressed like this
because I just came from dinner

38:22.248 --> 38:23.967
with Buddy Garrity, Lyla,

38:24.137 --> 38:27.216
and the new rich booster that I was
supposed to chat up about college.

38:28.685 --> 38:30.550
Which, between you and me,

38:30.837 --> 38:33.014
don't think I'm cut out for.

38:33.798 --> 38:35.170
You and me both.

38:36.794 --> 38:39.263
But it's nice to get this off and...

38:39.963 --> 38:42.939
kinda want to have a beer,
just chill out and watch...

38:43.461 --> 38:44.469
anything.

38:44.765 --> 38:46.069
Yeah, cheers.

38:53.685 --> 38:55.956
I ate pigeon tonight, Tyra.

38:58.344 --> 38:59.344
Why?

38:59.514 --> 39:01.792
- I don't know why.
- I don't know what pigeon looks like.

39:02.052 --> 39:03.188
It was crap.

39:03.465 --> 39:05.329
Could barely get through,
but I ate it

39:05.499 --> 39:08.299
because I didn't want them
to think I'm making a mistake.

39:21.782 --> 39:25.170
- Where are your pants?
- My pants are just over there...

39:25.510 --> 39:26.692
It was hot.

39:27.028 --> 39:29.236
So I just... geared down,
just chilling.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.618
- I brought you a cheeseburger.
- Seriously?

39:35.209 --> 39:36.331
I felt bad.

39:38.514 --> 39:39.514
Thank you.

39:41.225 --> 39:42.875
It's very sweet of you.

39:46.874 --> 39:48.130
Great.
You done?

39:49.159 --> 39:53.007
- I was waiting for him to start...
- You know what? Don't even...

39:53.896 --> 39:57.546
- Bye, y'all. Good seeing you.
- That's a good look for you, Tim.

39:58.860 --> 40:01.143
- I love you, Billy.
- I love you too, sweetie.

40:22.571 --> 40:24.421
Why are you in Landry's car?

40:27.386 --> 40:29.088
I just needed
to borrow it for something.

40:30.287 --> 40:31.773
You done with work?

40:32.371 --> 40:34.135
Yeah, long day.

40:34.628 --> 40:35.886
You want a ride?

40:38.421 --> 40:39.463
Sure.

40:48.643 --> 40:50.276
I went and saw my mom.

40:54.142 --> 40:55.743
That's a big step.

40:57.731 --> 41:00.492
I got her to sign
those papers, so...

41:02.246 --> 41:04.332
I'm an emancipated minor, now.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.541
Emancipated minor...

41:08.765 --> 41:10.630
That's kinda hot.

41:11.035 --> 41:13.685
- Yeah, you think?
- I think it's very hot.

41:13.871 --> 41:15.568
Does that mean you get to, like...

41:15.738 --> 41:17.787
vote, and drink, and...

41:17.957 --> 41:19.889
smoke, and rent cars?

41:22.283 --> 41:24.518
It means I get to take care
of old people.

41:25.196 --> 41:26.740
Yeah, maybe not so hot.

41:27.415 --> 41:28.752
Yeah, maybe not.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.354
- Stop the car. Stop, stop.
- What?

41:40.219 --> 41:42.186
This is the car I'm gonna buy.

41:44.219 --> 41:46.575
What do you think? It's the car
Mrs. Sadmark's gonna sell me

41:46.745 --> 41:48.626
when I make enough money
working at Applebee's.

41:49.755 --> 41:51.045
She's beautiful, isn't she?

41:53.676 --> 41:55.341
This is a Celica.

41:55.971 --> 41:58.324
Are you implying that maybe
I should buy a Dodge Dard

41:58.494 --> 42:00.809
and let the engine fall out,
so I can be just like you?

42:00.979 --> 42:02.306
Okay, it's beautiful.

42:03.323 --> 42:04.790
It's a beautiful...

42:06.179 --> 42:07.061
Celica.

42:07.684 --> 42:08.982
See? I told you.

42:10.253 --> 42:13.359
And maybe, if you're really nice to me,
I might give you a ride to shool.

42:14.811 --> 42:15.811
Maybe.
