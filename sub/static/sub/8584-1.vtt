01:21.960 --> 01:25.043
<i>When I was</i> a <i>girl and
we drove past the coal mines,</i>

01:25.160 --> 01:27.686
<i>it looked like
a story book to me.</i>

01:29.560 --> 01:31.164
<i>It seemed an army of men</i>

01:31.240 --> 01:33.402
<i>was doing something
so important</i>

01:33.480 --> 01:35.926
<i>it could change the world.</i>

01:38.040 --> 01:40.042
<i>That's when Mama would say,</i>

01:40.160 --> 01:42.766
<i>"Every time you
light a lamp to read,"</i>

01:42.840 --> 01:45.684
<i>"you can thank a coal miner."</i>

01:48.560 --> 01:51.643
<i>I was born and raised
in the hills of Virginia</i>

01:51.720 --> 01:53.051
<i>when coal was king.</i>

02:00.040 --> 02:02.361
<i>Life was simple
in Big Stone Gap.</i>

02:03.360 --> 02:05.203
<i>You went to Zackie's
for your jeans,</i>

02:06.360 --> 02:08.601
<i>you went to Gilley's
for your engagement ring.</i>

02:08.680 --> 02:11.923
<i>And you went to my family
drugstore when you were sick.</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:15.607
<i>On Friday nights
you rooted for the Vikings,</i>

02:15.680 --> 02:17.045
<i>and after the game,</i>

02:17.280 --> 02:19.487
<i>you went for burgers
at Carmine's to celebrate,</i>

02:19.560 --> 02:21.050
<i>because we never lost.</i>

02:24.000 --> 02:27.288
<i>Every year we put on The
</i> Trail <i>of the Lonesome Pine,</i>

02:27.720 --> 02:32.009
<i>the story of a mountain girl and
the mining engineer who loved her.</i>

02:32.760 --> 02:35.650
<i>You either acted a part
or played in the band</i>

02:35.720 --> 02:38.246
<i>or worked behind the
scenes, like me.</i>

02:41.080 --> 02:43.162
<i>One year was a lot
like the last,</i>

02:43.240 --> 02:44.810
<i>and before I knew it,</i>

02:45.280 --> 02:48.204
<i>it was 1978 and I turned 40.</i>

02:49.400 --> 02:51.641
<i>Almost overnight,</i>

02:51.720 --> 02:53.927
<i>I was the old maid
in Big Stone Gap.</i>

02:55.000 --> 02:57.924
<i>It seemed like happiness
was for other people.</i>

03:14.200 --> 03:15.361
Morning, beautiful.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.090
I don't know why
you're honking the horn,

03:17.160 --> 03:19.520
I'm standing out here black as
night, I know you can see me.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.483
Oh, good, you got Miss Weston's
stuff right for the first time.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.241
Yeah, I'm gonna give you something
else if you don't leave me alone.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.206
Morning, Nan.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.044
Cherry pie was just
wonderful. Thank you.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.005
It was rhubarb.

04:04.480 --> 04:08.246
Them last ones you brought
over here blocked me up.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.760
Doc Daugherty swears
these won't.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.928
You just need to take them with
some buttermilk in your stomach.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.930
I got coffee on.
Biscuits and gravy.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.560
Well, I can't stay. I've got
two more hollers to hit.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.880
Oh, come on. One
cup won't keep you.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.840
Jeepers Christmas, Jack!

04:23.000 --> 04:24.331
Put some clothes on.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.201
Yes, ma'am.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.210
Morning, Jack. Morning.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.046
You'll have to excuse my son.

04:43.320 --> 04:47.530
He was out till all hours last
night with that Sweet Sue Tinsley.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.002
That ain't a girl
built for heavy lifting.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.810
Woman has a man around doesn't
have to do a lot of heavy lifting.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.042
Well, I don't know
what he's thinking.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.607
Sure you do. Sweet Sue Tinsley?

04:58.680 --> 05:00.091
Come on. She's a catch.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.920
Prettiest girl in high school.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.928
She made a bikini in Home-Ec
and it won the blue ribbon.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.843
Modeled it in
front of Assembly.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.690
Brought half the crowd
to their feet at least.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.330
<i>I'll bet.</i>

05:09.440 --> 05:11.329
Beat the heck out of my apron.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.245
Well, she's a
flaunter, all right.

05:14.320 --> 05:19.247
And she's got a big mess over there
with that divorce and all them kids.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.243
You ever want you
some young'uns?

05:21.320 --> 05:23.049
No, it's not gonna
happen for me.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.408
It is never too late.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.927
My own mamaw was
an old maid, too.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.641
Almost 43 when
she had my daddy.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.051
She had a baby one week,

05:34.120 --> 05:36.088
then done went into
the change the next.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.203
Anything can happen.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.885
What are y'all
whispering about?

05:40.160 --> 05:41.525
Ooh, I got to scoot.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.011
Eula Belcher's all seized up

05:43.080 --> 05:44.844
and in dire need of
her muscle relaxers.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.321
Oh... See her out, Son.
All right.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.528
Thank you very much and that's
all right, I'll see myself out.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.728
No, no. Best not
to argue with Mama.

06:00.680 --> 06:01.681
Here, let me help you.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.851
Here you go.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.645
Easy.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.247
You have very
soft hands for a coal miner.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.165
No, I got calluses.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.962
That's how I follow the seams
in the rock to the coal.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.041
Hey, hold on!

06:17.280 --> 06:18.841
Come here, I want to
show you something.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.451
Like my new truck?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.484
1978 Ford pickup.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.324
Four-wheeler, fully loaded.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.006
Right fancy.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.484
Nobody ever accused
me of being fancy.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.847
It's a pickup, not a Caddy.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.087
Hey. You going to the party
on opening night?

06:43.520 --> 06:46.046
Of course I am.
Theodore's taking me.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.330
Are you ever gonna marry him?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.411
You been talking to Fleeta?

06:50.480 --> 06:51.925
Just one of the
girls, ain't you?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.480
I always took you for the
strong, silent type.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.642
You ain't scared of
them strays, are ya?

06:58.040 --> 06:59.041
No.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.765
Who are you afraid of?

07:11.680 --> 07:12.681
Howdy, Mama!

07:13.000 --> 07:14.001
Did you eat?

07:14.280 --> 07:15.805
Oh, not a bite all day.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.401
Oh, I pack up a dinner for you.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.768
Who has got time to eat?

07:22.040 --> 07:25.408
The whole town is a-flutter
with our final dress rehearsal.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.646
Oh, you know, I cast everybody
from here to Keokee

07:28.760 --> 07:30.808
whether they have talent
or are lacking.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.964
You choose them,
they have talent.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.041
I know this.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.966
Oh, so, the box office.
You sell the tickets?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.166
No idea.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.730
Whole town's in the dang thing.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.245
There's nobody
left to set for it.

07:42.720 --> 07:45.200
Johnny Wood, he made the
announcement on the radio,

07:45.280 --> 07:47.521
WCYB.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.249
Well, I have to say that the poster
in the pharmacy window is gorgeous

07:51.360 --> 07:54.091
and we did manage to paper Scott,
Dickenson and Lee Counties.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.884
That'll bring 'em in some.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.811
I know this.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.405
You're gonna get a good crowd.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.281
I work you too hard.
You're exhausted.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.726
You need to sleep.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.330
Don't worry about me,
carissima.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.131
Dr. Daugherty said
the new pills, they work.

08:15.240 --> 08:19.086
I'm sewing the last seam on
the last costume.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.008
Ave, let's go!

08:24.280 --> 08:27.204
And do not forget my costume!

08:28.920 --> 08:30.285
<i>Oh, Aspetta.</i>

08:31.000 --> 08:32.683
Theodore's costume. Thank you.

08:32.919 --> 08:35.082
"And I shall rise
on the third day."

08:35.200 --> 08:37.931
Come... Ave, where are you?
Let's go!

08:38.240 --> 08:41.210
You are the director!
You cannot be late!

08:41.280 --> 08:43.520
Oh, <i>aspetta!</i> Tayloe!
Tayloe's costume!

08:44.680 --> 08:48.287
Say "break a leg," just like
a professional. Break a leg.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.884
I'm coming, I'm coming!

08:55.680 --> 08:57.648
Costume looks
great, Mrs. Mulligan!

09:10.800 --> 09:13.963
<i>This</i> is <i>The Trail
of the Lonesome Pine,</i>

09:14.040 --> 09:16.884
and my name is June Tolliver.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.284
I left here a poor
mountain girl,

09:20.520 --> 09:22.409
and have returned...

09:23.640 --> 09:26.166
I have returned...

09:29.360 --> 09:30.691
A lady? A lady.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.051
I don't fit in.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.520
All right, just stop.
My teeth hurt.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.844
Tayloe, learn your lines!

09:36.920 --> 09:40.208
All right. Yes. Everybody,
thank you so very much!

09:40.400 --> 09:41.845
Will you please leave
your costumes on the rack?

09:42.000 --> 09:46.210
Hey y'all! We're officially
sold out for opening night!

09:47.920 --> 09:48.921
Where's Spec?

09:49.000 --> 09:49.967
Right here.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.168
This is bigger
than a four alarm fire!

09:52.520 --> 09:54.761
I need you real bad, Spec.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.281
We're full up!

09:56.560 --> 09:57.925
Order another keg.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.525
Consider it done, Iva Lou.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.450
Long as I get the first dance.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.966
You're the sexiest librarian
in four counties, Iva Lou!

10:10.160 --> 10:11.650
Okay, Sweet Sue, you're on.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.808
Come down the aisle. Up.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.485
Up. Up.

10:25.680 --> 10:29.048
Lam going over to Carmine's for a burger.
You want to come?

10:29.240 --> 10:30.241
Uh, not right now.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.965
I have to run lines
with the star.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.451
Uh, I know my lines.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.722
Good job on the timing of that cue.
Thank you.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.283
And I do suspect that little
Penny Coomer has a crush on you.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.484
You're it!

10:43.720 --> 10:45.961
Appears she's already
over me, ma'am.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.606
Jack, honey!

10:48.680 --> 10:51.331
I swear, sometimes
we make music

10:51.400 --> 10:53.402
like we belong
in the Grand Ole Opry.

10:53.480 --> 10:57.201
Hardly puts me in the mind of Minnie
Pearl, you displaying that leotard.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.169
Why, thank you.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.766
Okay, Pearl. I don't care if
everybody goes home naked...

11:01.840 --> 11:03.842
Ave. I need you to come here.

11:04.440 --> 11:05.601
You need to come with me.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.601
You gotta get Duke McMillan.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.409
I'm staying late. He knows CPR.

11:09.840 --> 11:13.083
Darling, it's not a Rescue Squad run.
It's your mama.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.445
Come on.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.890
<i>No one worries
about you like your mother.</i>

11:21.080 --> 11:24.687
<i>And when she's gone,
the world seems unsafe.</i>

11:25.480 --> 11:29.201
<i>You can't turn to her anymore
and it changes your life</i>

11:29.280 --> 11:30.441
<i>forever.</i>

12:00.920 --> 12:03.605
Hey, Miss Ave. You probably
don't remember me,

12:03.680 --> 12:06.570
but my name's Bobby Dinsmore
from over on Skeens Ridge.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.766
Well, sure I do.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.962
I used to play the sax in the band.
Mmm-hmm.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.561
Your mama made me
this here uniform,

12:12.640 --> 12:15.689
'cause they didn't have one big
enough to fit me at the factory.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.242
I bet you nobody knew
it was homemade.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.489
Well, it still looks right
nice on you, Mr. Bobby.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.845
All of you look right pretty,
as a matter of fact.

12:29.320 --> 12:33.928
Since our almighty God has called our
sister, Fiammetta Onicelli Mulligan

12:34.280 --> 12:35.884
from this life, to himself,

12:36.400 --> 12:39.210
we commit her body to the
earth from which it came.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.087
Give her eternal rest, O Lord,

12:42.160 --> 12:44.527
and may your light
shine on her forever.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.486
Don't cry, Fleets.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.451
When are you gonna cry?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.041
I can't.

13:16.080 --> 13:20.722
Why would you put a rose
on your daddy's grave

13:20.880 --> 13:23.451
after he treated you
like such dirt?

13:24.840 --> 13:26.330
Maybe he'll do something kind

13:26.400 --> 13:28.209
and look out for Mama
when she gets there.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.488
I do not like that sign.
The N fell off.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.889
My brother kept this
building pristine.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.411
You've let the place
go to hell!

15:01.480 --> 15:04.324
Why Aunt Alice, I can't
believe you haven't heard.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.210
In honor of Mommy's memory,

15:06.280 --> 15:07.930
Mutual's has officially
gone Italian.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.210
From now on, everything around
here is gonna end in a vowel.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.886
My brother Fred'd be ashamed!

15:16.640 --> 15:18.290
Sail on, Alice.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.844
Alice,

15:21.920 --> 15:23.888
sail on.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.011
Thank you for the pineapple upside
down cake. It was delicious.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.285
I did not send it.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.971
It was not mine.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.563
Mine was a Texas sheet cake,
which I hope you froze.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.044
I did, right next
to my emotions.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.361
Well, you know, Alice Lambert

15:45.440 --> 15:49.126
wouldn't have a reason to mess
with you if you had a husband.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.924
You know, I know
Theodore's a Yankee,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.331
but, hell, at this point,

15:52.400 --> 15:54.289
you just gotta take
whatever you can get.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.442
I like being the town spinster.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.090
It has cachet, Fleeta.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.361
Yeah, well,
you can't hug cachet.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.840
Well, thanks for
stopping by, Doug Kilgore.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.887
You tell that peanut farmer
that I say, "Hi."

16:09.040 --> 16:10.530
Thank you, Spec.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.681
You take care, now.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.922
Mr. Broadwater
will see you now, Ave.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.160
Tell your mama and them
I said, "Hi." I will.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.049
Come on in, darling.
Take a seat.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.121
Yeah.

16:25.200 --> 16:29.000
Ave, how long I been a lawyer?

16:30.240 --> 16:31.526
Long time.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.011
And what I learned is this.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.043
When people die,

16:35.120 --> 16:36.645
that's when all
the secrets come out.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.844
Earl, shut the damn door!

16:41.920 --> 16:44.605
I swear that boy hasn't got the
sense that God gave a screwdriver.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.281
Anyway-

16:47.400 --> 16:50.165
A while back, your mama came in
to see me about doing her will,

16:50.920 --> 16:52.922
which I did.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.604
And when I was
gonna notarize it,

16:56.680 --> 16:57.727
she added the letter.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.170
I don't understand.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.883
You will when you
read it, darling.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.844
You best take a deep breath.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.167
<i>I'll send the rest of
the files to you, Miss Ave.</i>

18:31.320 --> 18:35.530
"too ashamed and never told
them about my angel girl. Mama."

18:35.840 --> 18:37.729
How did this happen?

18:38.040 --> 18:40.088
She was already pregnant
when she left Italy.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.367
And she was too ashamed
to tell her family.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.806
Came and found work
as a seamstress, so...

18:50.320 --> 18:53.529
Fred Mulligan felt sorry
for her and married her.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.727
Which explains why
he never liked me.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.928
'Cause I'm not even his.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.243
This is my father.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.087
Well, this sure
explains your nose.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.284
Ave, he's pretty suave.

19:24.760 --> 19:25.761
Yeah.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.251
Very.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.524
You gonna go find him?

19:31.840 --> 19:33.968
Why would he want me?
No man ever did.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.451
I do.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.884
<i>Hey! Ave! Pull over!</i>

20:02.960 --> 20:04.485
<i>Pull over!</i>

20:06.680 --> 20:08.569
<i>Wise County Bookmobile.</i>

20:08.640 --> 20:11.564
<i>Next stop, Shawnee Avenue.</i>

20:15.160 --> 20:18.482
Wait! Don't go! I got two
check-outs for you. Don't go.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.641
Okay.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.570
This is my favorite book on
Chinese face reading.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.201
No, no. I've read the face
of every man I've ever known.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.091
It's never been wrong.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.483
You really think
face reading's true?

20:31.560 --> 20:33.483
It never fails.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.411
I gotta say. I'm not one bit
surprised you're out here crying,

20:36.480 --> 20:38.084
all tore up and all alone.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.487
You got a perfect little
cupid's bow on your lip,

20:40.600 --> 20:43.001
which means you are proud

20:43.320 --> 20:44.321
and private

20:45.320 --> 20:47.163
and romantic. See?

20:47.320 --> 20:49.766
Yeah, but all that information
is useless if you don't love.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.923
Now, that's where old Charlotte
Bronte comes in with her Jane Eyre.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.691
Miss Bronté can write
her a love scene.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.967
"Yearning and longing."

21:00.520 --> 21:02.727
"Longing and yearning."

21:03.240 --> 21:06.449
Nothing will take your mind off
your tragedy than a good romance.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.760
I haven't seen this
since I was a girl.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.444
Yeah, well, it's time
for a revisit.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.408
And take notes, honey.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.084
Please, take notes.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.044
Call you later!

21:24.920 --> 21:26.604
My book report,
but I hate <i>Moby Dick.</i>

21:26.800 --> 21:28.131
My gosh, I love those shoes.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.326
May I borrow them for
my barbecue tonight?

21:29.400 --> 21:30.401
Why, thank you.

21:30.640 --> 21:31.846
Bobby's gonna be there.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.570
So I'm gonna pick up some
lipstick for that, too.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.687
Totally.

21:35.320 --> 21:38.324
Hey, Miss Ave?
Got my prescription ready?

21:38.960 --> 21:39.961
Not yet.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.560
She's so slow. I don't understand
what takes her so long, right?

21:42.720 --> 21:43.721
Hey, ladies!

21:44.760 --> 21:46.410
Put that lipstick down.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.482
And do not touch
any more magazines,

21:48.560 --> 21:51.006
because our patrons
like them untouched.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.846
Virginal.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.447
If prescriptions
didn't take so long,

21:55.520 --> 21:56.567
we wouldn't read 'em, Fleeta.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.563
Don't make me call your mother.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.085
It's Pearl Grimes.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.481
Look at her!

22:01.920 --> 22:03.922
She is the ugliest thing
I have ever seen.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.161
So sad.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.241
Well, you know she's a mess.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.681
I mean, that clothing.
You know it's from Goodwill.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.880
Think about all the people
that have worn that before,

22:10.920 --> 22:12.968
and she's putting it
on her daughter...

22:13.640 --> 22:14.846
<i>Tayloe Slagle.</i>

22:14.920 --> 22:16.968
<i>Your birth control pills are
ready over at the counter.</i>

22:17.040 --> 22:19.247
<i>Your birth control
pills are ready.</i>

22:19.720 --> 22:23.088
<i>Thank you so much
for trading at Mutual's.</i>

22:24.080 --> 22:25.650
<i>Hope to see you soon.</i>

22:25.760 --> 22:27.961
I can't believe... Can you
believe she just... Let's go!

22:28.000 --> 22:29.081
Come on, girls. From now on

22:29.200 --> 22:30.561
I'm getting my pills
in Appalachia.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.283
They're not very bright.

22:42.200 --> 22:45.329
I'd rather be pretty and stupid
like them than what I am.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.805
Mmm, no, you wouldn't.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.849
Pretty fades, honey.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.125
Stupid, it's annoying.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.721
They got talent, too.
They baton twirl.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.325
It's not a talent one
calls upon later in life.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.608
Well, I ain't got no talent.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.007
And I ain't good at nothing.

23:07.640 --> 23:08.641
Mmm...

23:10.960 --> 23:13.486
You know, it's just Fleeta
and me around here.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.170
We could use a hand.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.244
Me? You want to give me a job?

23:19.560 --> 23:21.369
What do you say?

23:21.480 --> 23:24.643
We ain't got no car. I mean,
how am I gonna get here?

23:25.480 --> 23:27.084
I run all over
these hills, hon.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.844
Wouldn't be nothing
for me to pick you up.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.450
You could start by tackling that
big pile of junk sitting there,

23:32.680 --> 23:34.205
and take some of that
out back for me?

23:36.320 --> 23:38.004
That'd be a big help.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.321
Okay.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.091
Thanks.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.921
So, this is your idea
of the new employee?

23:46.960 --> 23:49.167
You know, she don't keep
herself very nice.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.601
You just don't like Melungeons.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.009
No, I don't.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.562
But she'll do.

23:57.720 --> 24:01.202
<i>This is the box office speaking.
We are sold out!</i>

24:01.360 --> 24:04.648
<i>If you don't have a ticket,
then you do not have a seat.</i>

24:04.800 --> 24:06.450
<i>I repeat, if you
don't have a ticket,</i>

24:06.520 --> 24:08.522
<i>then you do not have a seat.</i>

24:08.680 --> 24:10.125
I've asked you a dozen times,

24:10.200 --> 24:11.804
it is the penultimate
moment in the play.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.803
I mean, have you ever seen
West Side Story?

24:13.880 --> 24:16.281
It's like, if Chino died
of an epileptic seizure.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.931
What is supposed to
happen is very simple.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.281
Point the gun at me.
Thank you, Virgil.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.486
No. Wait a minute.
Is that a prop?

24:22.560 --> 24:23.720
You know what? Point it away.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.444
It's supposed to be a shot

24:25.800 --> 24:27.040
and then blood.

24:27.160 --> 24:30.448
But what we have here
is a shot, no blood!

24:30.600 --> 24:32.170
Okay, Mr. Tipton,
let me tell you.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.726
I'm gonna take this here tube and I'm
gonna rig it right up your pants...

24:34.800 --> 24:36.609
I can't act with
a tube in my pants!

24:37.000 --> 24:38.729
Oh, for crying out loud!

24:39.080 --> 24:40.206
I am so sorry, honey.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.884
Just go make sure that Sweet
Sue has her underpants on.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.286
Now, you listen to me!

24:43.440 --> 24:47.445
These temper tantrums may have gotten you
results at the Bucks County Playhouse,

24:47.520 --> 24:50.251
but around here we do
peaceable on opening night.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.290
We do peaceable
on opening night

24:52.400 --> 24:55.165
because you cannot train
amateurs to be professionals.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.440
And let me tell you something.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.808
At the Bucks County Playhouse,
we had a prop master.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.251
I had a prop master.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.160
And then they added a night shift to
the Quik Mart and he had to resign.

25:04.680 --> 25:05.681
Naturally.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.922
I am doing the best I can.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.042
You could put a broom up my ass

25:10.120 --> 25:12.168
and I would sweep the
floor at the same time.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.123
Now, we will use two squibs.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.607
If one doesn't go off,
then the other one will.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.209
Okay. Sounds reasonable.
Excellent.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.965
Michelangelo said,
"Genius is eternal patience."

25:25.320 --> 25:27.448
Another know-it-all Italian.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.564
Five minutes to curtain!

25:29.640 --> 25:31.324
Final touches and places,
everybody.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.926
Places, all right,
let's go. Final touches!

25:35.920 --> 25:38.924
Wait. Someone's locked me
out of my dressing room!

25:40.360 --> 25:43.250
Okay. Places, everyone!

25:43.760 --> 25:45.046
Good job.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.645
Music.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.044
Mr. MacChesney
just winked at you.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.804
No, he didn't. He's got
something in his eye.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.167
Yes, he did. I saw him.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.084
Well, look.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.770
I believe I need a seat.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.801
I believe you're drunk, sir.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.366
That's my Jade East cologne.

26:17.480 --> 26:18.811
Do you like it?

26:23.680 --> 26:26.889
Even if I did, we're sold out.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.089
I didn't catch your name.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.525
Lyle Makin.

26:36.600 --> 26:40.491
How did you hear about
our outdoor extravaganza?

26:41.360 --> 26:43.010
Well, I came to see Jack Mac.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.561
We grew up together.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.648
Well, now I live up in
Crackers Neck Holler.

26:47.840 --> 26:52.209
Well, I should visit
Crackers Neck often.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.130
And Holler.

26:56.920 --> 26:58.604
On...

27:03.480 --> 27:05.562
And on the third day

27:05.720 --> 27:07.563
I shall rise

27:08.040 --> 27:11.089
from the ashes of regret

27:12.560 --> 27:13.891
like a phoenix!

27:15.200 --> 27:16.281
Oh, no!

27:16.680 --> 27:18.011
Howard, shoot him again!

27:18.520 --> 27:19.646
Shoot! Shoot him again!

27:19.720 --> 27:21.245
Like a phoenix!

27:21.560 --> 27:23.449
Have a heart attack!
Have a heart attack!

27:23.680 --> 27:25.091
Get struck by lightning!

27:28.480 --> 27:29.561
Good job.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.291
Everybody dance!

27:39.280 --> 27:40.406
Ow! Watch it, Sue!

27:51.880 --> 27:53.928
You're too late!

27:55.080 --> 27:58.323
<i>The opening night party
is for cast and crew only.</i>

27:58.680 --> 28:02.526
<i>Everyone else is welcome to use their
two-for-one coupons at Carmine's.</i>

28:02.680 --> 28:04.967
<i>Leave in an orderly fashion.</i>

28:10.880 --> 28:13.087
Oh, my God.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.685
You are a wildcat. You know it.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.367
Come to Ding Daddy! Happy to!

28:19.160 --> 28:20.207
Oh!

28:20.280 --> 28:22.931
Ladies, meet Lyle Makin.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.161
Hello, Lyle.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.451
He got the last seat
in the theater.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.760
Really? Mmm-hmm.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.444
Then where was you setting?

28:31.120 --> 28:32.770
On his lap.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.046
Mmm-hmm.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.088
Where can I get
something to drink?

28:36.960 --> 28:38.325
That way.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.570
Ladies.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.087
Iva Lou, I'll see you
at the keg.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.642
There's something to this one.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.730
I think he wants more than
a rendezvous at the High Knob

28:49.800 --> 28:52.610
with a fifth of Night Train
and a sack of Cab's donuts.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.680
And you got all that
from setting on his lap?

28:55.760 --> 28:58.411
No, ma'am.
Chinese face reading.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.810
He's got the chin
of an emperor.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.320
Iva Lou? Hmm?

29:05.400 --> 29:08.370
You don't need a book to
learn what to do with a man.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.968
Now, me and Krifflum,

29:11.040 --> 29:13.520
we are still having
intimate relations.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.722
Even though I'm in
the middle of the change.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.729
And I'll tell you
something else.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.763
This is an old toaster.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.569
But when he plugs it in...

29:24.760 --> 29:27.604
<i>What</i> a <i>magnificent
opening night!</i>

29:27.680 --> 29:29.409
<i>Give yourselves a hand!</i>

29:34.440 --> 29:36.442
<i>I have wonderful news.</i>

29:37.800 --> 29:41.885
<i>In a few short weeks,
Mr. John Warner,</i>

29:41.960 --> 29:44.327
<i>candidate for senator
of Virginia,</i>

29:44.840 --> 29:47.161
<i>will be making a campaign stop</i>

29:47.240 --> 29:48.651
<i>in Big Stone Gap,</i>

29:49.040 --> 29:51.884
<i>with his movie star wife,</i>

29:52.560 --> 29:54.562
<i>Elizabeth Taylor!</i>

29:58.240 --> 29:59.730
My God!

30:01.240 --> 30:04.084
<i>We have to feed 'em and entertain 'em.
And if you'd like to help</i>

30:04.160 --> 30:06.731
<i>there are sign-up sheets for
committees in the Tolliver House.</i>

30:07.560 --> 30:10.370
<i>Theodore Tipton, you're
in charge of the show!</i>

30:11.280 --> 30:14.409
<i>Now I'm gonna turn the stage
over to Sweet Sue Tinsley,</i>

30:14.760 --> 30:17.047
<i>the president-elect
of The Foxes,</i>

30:17.120 --> 30:18.849
<i>our volunteer ushers.</i>

30:21.320 --> 30:22.845
Probably gonna do a cartwheel.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.605
<i>Thank you, Nellie.
Ava? Ava Marie?</i>

30:26.400 --> 30:29.210
<i>As president of The Foxes,</i>

30:29.320 --> 30:32.961
<i>we would like to thank you for
being such a good director.</i>

30:33.640 --> 30:35.244
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

30:35.640 --> 30:38.166
<i>Nobody hands out programs
like The Foxes do.</i>

30:38.240 --> 30:41.005
Hey, Ave. It ain't
good to drink alone!

30:41.240 --> 30:42.960
Who you gonna
share that bottle with?

30:43.520 --> 30:45.170
Ave Maria needs a man.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.521
Hey, hey! Excuse me!

30:48.280 --> 30:49.850
She has her own man.

31:00.480 --> 31:01.925
What just happened?

31:02.040 --> 31:03.565
You just kissed me.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.405
No, you kissed me.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.401
Let's eat.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.842
Something to eat? Uh, no.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.286
I'm not hungry.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.489
I've got band practice.

31:43.560 --> 31:44.766
And, um...

31:45.880 --> 31:48.326
And with Elizabeth Taylor
coming to town,

31:48.560 --> 31:50.480
I'm gonna have to put on
a doozy of a show, so...

31:51.680 --> 31:53.045
I'll call you later? Yeah.

31:57.760 --> 31:58.886
Okay.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.604
That oak leaf is
a particularly good one.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.047
There.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.600
You do realize that every
time you smash it like that,

32:11.680 --> 32:13.842
you rub all the glitter
off, don't you?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.048
And why would you order
something that looks like...

32:16.160 --> 32:17.889
I could've picked these up
off the ground.

32:17.960 --> 32:21.681
I like the idea of adding
these going vertical like,

32:21.840 --> 32:25.242
'cause I think for the close
passerby, they're very interesting.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.606
This is more of
a sophisticated look.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.444
Whatever you want.
I'm just gonna say,

32:28.520 --> 32:31.490
"I'm so sorry I didn't know
I was doing such a bad job."

32:31.560 --> 32:32.891
I've been doing
this windows for,

32:32.960 --> 32:34.321
I don't know,
since you was little.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.805
Hey, Fleeta...

32:39.440 --> 32:41.363
That's the Wence Mine.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.245
Carmine, over here!

33:02.320 --> 33:04.084
Hey, get in there!

33:06.600 --> 33:08.011
We need to get him oxygen!

33:08.080 --> 33:09.923
It's okay, pal.
We're right here.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.570
There you go.
That's a good one.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.243
<i>Everyone's
accounted for. Lucky day.</i>

33:16.320 --> 33:17.560
<i>Could've been a lot worse.</i>

33:18.080 --> 33:19.411
Spec, show me that.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.845
Don't wait on me, honey. Leola's
here checking on her cousin.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.491
Okay.
I'll catch a ride with her.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.486
Jack?

33:30.640 --> 33:32.130
You worried about
little old me?

33:34.320 --> 33:36.721
You thought I bought
the farm, didn't you?

33:36.800 --> 33:38.325
All right. I like this.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.451
Can I give you a lift?

33:44.040 --> 33:45.041
Uh...

33:45.120 --> 33:46.724
Don't be proud.

33:47.840 --> 33:51.481
It's just a 1973 un-American
3-speed transmission.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.403
Oh. Thank you, ma'am.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.808
Mind if we stop
at Mutual's first?

33:57.440 --> 34:01.604
I need a box of Clairo I so I can
rinse these ma'am's out of my hair.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.763
Well, I don't see any grays.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.808
You haven't changed
a bit since high school.

34:08.120 --> 34:11.043
Is that a good thing?
I think so.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.610
Take it from one who's changed.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.768
You haven't changed at all.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.045
Shoot.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.964
Girls still after you.
Good at sports.

34:19.320 --> 34:20.685
Kind to your mother.

34:21.679 --> 34:23.364
Gary Cooper of Big Stone Gap.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.844
Hey, you had your
share of suitors.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.639
Wayne Rutledge had
a crush on you for years.

34:28.719 --> 34:31.041
Wayne Junior's not one
to be real proud of.

34:31.639 --> 34:35.565
He's doing 7 to 10 for robbing his
podiatrist 'cause his feet hurt.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.290
Yeah, Wayne.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.330
I heard he's still
got all his hair.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.920
After 30 you've got to
put that in the plus column.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.368
There you are!

34:48.800 --> 34:50.290
Jack! Hey, hey!

34:53.040 --> 34:54.246
Honey. Are you all right?

34:54.360 --> 34:55.600
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

34:55.840 --> 34:56.841
Lordy.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.490
Are you all right? Yeah.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.766
She's such a fawner.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.205
Are you all right? Yeah.

35:01.760 --> 35:05.287
Son, I heard everything
on the police radio.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.044
You done good. You saved a man.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.770
Your daddy would be
so proud of you.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.171
You're a hero!

35:10.240 --> 35:11.366
No, no.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.726
Hi, Ava.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.087
Sue!

35:16.960 --> 35:19.361
It's Ave, okay? Ave.

35:20.280 --> 35:23.090
Not Ava, like Ava Gardner.
But Ave Maria,

35:23.160 --> 35:24.321
like the prayer.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.560
You know, we went through
school for 12 years together

35:26.600 --> 35:28.040
and you never once
got my name right.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.242
Well, law me. Sorry.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.606
Let's go.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.521
Peewee football
team right here,

35:42.600 --> 35:44.568
junior baton twirlers here,

35:44.760 --> 35:47.081
and Liz Taylor lookalikes here.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.721
Coca-Cola cake, 7-Up cake,

35:50.800 --> 35:52.928
or Betty Cline's
blackberry cobbler?

35:53.080 --> 35:54.127
Cobbler.

35:54.200 --> 35:57.124
I think I have put
together a show

35:57.200 --> 36:00.522
that's gonna top her entrance
into Rome in Cleopatra.

36:00.640 --> 36:03.086
I'm gonna use the outside of
Fraley's Coach House...

36:03.280 --> 36:05.521
And turn it into downtown Rome.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.530
We're going to have
a choir and festoonery

36:08.600 --> 36:10.409
and Cleopatra, the majorette.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.931
I think I forgot to get coffee.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.241
How could you be out? People always
dropping off their grief pies.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.410
Oh, here's some. It may be
old, but we'll do what we can.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.206
Oh, my lord.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.002
Iva Lou, these are in Italian.

36:31.400 --> 36:35.405
I think these may be letters
from my father to my mother.

36:35.480 --> 36:38.370
It's bad luck to read other
people's private correspondence.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.360
Especially when that person
just passed away.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.881
Oh, read 'em.

37:08.680 --> 37:10.921
What does it all mean?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.087
Not that it matters.

37:12.160 --> 37:15.403
Everything sounds better
in Italian. Keep going.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.605
Bliss. Pure bliss.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.844
Oh, If Lyle Makin
could speak Italian,

37:55.200 --> 37:56.770
I'd never let him
out of my trailer.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.285
Would you two please
pay attention?

37:58.360 --> 37:59.521
I'm under a lot of
pressure here.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.568
I've gotta be the Bob Fosse

38:01.640 --> 38:03.768
of Big Stone Gap
in a parking lot.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.008
Ave's life is important, too.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.202
Elizabeth Taylor
will come and go,

38:08.280 --> 38:09.884
but we're here forever.

38:09.960 --> 38:10.961
All right, girls.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.731
I'm going. I cannot work

38:12.800 --> 38:14.529
in an environment of frivolity,

38:14.600 --> 38:17.649
when I have to dazzle the
world's biggest movie star.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.961
Oh, but the cobbler's
not even thawed yet.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.920
I'm sure there's plenty
more where that came from.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.247
Bye.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.205
Bye.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.211
<i>I don't know
what his problem is.</i>

38:34.280 --> 38:35.691
<i>He's wound tighter than a tick.</i>

38:36.320 --> 38:38.049
Well, he's an artist.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.524
He pours himself into his work.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.001
He loves music and the theater

38:44.480 --> 38:45.606
and marching bands.

38:46.480 --> 38:49.848
Sometimes I think he like them little
soldiers more than he likes you.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.847
How is it going in
the romance department?

38:55.080 --> 38:56.605
He wants more time.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.603
Lordy mercy!

38:58.720 --> 39:01.724
I never heard of a man
who wanted to wait.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.082
Go out on that truck,
you pick a book.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.765
Any book.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.929
Read between the lines.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.560
What does Chinese face
reading say about Theodore?

39:11.600 --> 39:13.602
His forehead says
he's stubborn.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.320
That book of yours have a follow-up,
'cause that I already know.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.606
Tell me something new.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.770
Honey-O.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.404
People are talking.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.727
You've been best friends
with a man for years

39:25.840 --> 39:28.047
without getting married
in this town.

39:28.120 --> 39:30.691
That makes you a lot
like Mount Vesuvius.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.529
People are just standing around

39:32.640 --> 39:34.130
waiting for you to blow.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.801
But there's more.
No, there's not.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.041
I didn't want to pile on,

39:39.120 --> 39:40.884
but my Lyle's clerk in the
court in Pennington Gap,

39:40.960 --> 39:43.406
and he told me Alice Lambert filed
papers against you in Lee County.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.209
But I want you know
I didn't just sleep with him

39:45.320 --> 39:46.401
to get that information
on your behalf.

39:46.480 --> 39:48.164
That is so big of you, Iva Lou.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.203
I like his mind. I'm sure you do.
Now, get.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.406
Love you.

39:51.480 --> 39:52.481
Oh!

39:53.760 --> 39:55.524
Are you okay? Yeah!

39:57.320 --> 39:59.129
I don't care what you say, Ave.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.243
If there is
the slightest chance

40:01.440 --> 40:03.090
that Elizabeth Taylor

40:03.160 --> 40:06.528
is gonna be riding right
down here on Main Street,

40:06.640 --> 40:09.166
she might have to stop
and get herself a diuretic.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.726
She'll come in here
and see all the signage.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.330
That's what I want.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.208
Where's that Cleopatra wig
you called me about?

40:16.320 --> 40:17.720
It's in the box right there.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.171
Ah! Yes!

40:20.840 --> 40:22.046
Fleeta! Yes.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.328
Where's the black hair dye?
In my pocket.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.165
You getting the last box. Oh!

40:26.240 --> 40:28.004
But, I just want to warn you,

40:28.080 --> 40:29.605
when you wake up
tomorrow morning,

40:29.680 --> 40:31.330
you still gonna look like you,

40:31.520 --> 40:33.204
except with really dark hair.

40:33.520 --> 40:36.251
All my life I wanted to look
like Elizabeth Taylor.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.011
And now I will.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.080
Charge it.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.250
You gonna be in for a shocker

40:42.320 --> 40:43.765
when you see
what you look like.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.162
Okay. I'll have to deal
with this rat's nest later.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.366
I am late for rehearsal.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.442
Rome has to be built in a day.

40:49.520 --> 40:52.091
Why would you feed
into this lunacy?

40:52.160 --> 40:54.766
We should make
Liz Taylor makeup kits.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.249
These women been
watching Liz Taylor

40:57.320 --> 40:59.800
up on the silver screen
all their lives.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.287
Now they believe
Liz Taylor's come here

41:02.360 --> 41:04.044
'cause she wants to watch them.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.571
Hey, Fleeta?

41:05.640 --> 41:06.846
Get ready, babe, you're next.

41:07.040 --> 41:10.123
For what? I don't see any Diahann
Carroll color up in here.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.290
History tells us,

41:12.360 --> 41:13.964
Cleopatra was a black woman.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.207
Afternoon, Miss Fleeta.

41:17.280 --> 41:19.521
It's Sweet Sue Tinsley's boys!

41:19.600 --> 41:21.728
Look, Jack, a clown!

41:24.680 --> 41:26.569
Jared, that's not nice.
You apologize.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.366
Sorry.

41:29.240 --> 41:30.446
I need a tissue.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.640
They're in the back, Miss Ave.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.161
Can I have some candy?

41:34.200 --> 41:36.521
Now, you know candy's
very bad for your teeth.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.410
But it is very good
for your stomach,

41:38.480 --> 41:40.926
so you go on and take
as much as you want.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.650
What do you say? Thank you.

41:42.720 --> 41:43.801
You're very welcome.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.651
Come on, Jared.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.161
That's compliments
of me and the clown.

41:54.440 --> 41:57.284
Jack Mac likes Ave Maria.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.400
Girl,

41:59.560 --> 42:03.246
you know less about men
than you do about cosmetics.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.608
If Ave would just
give him a chance,

42:05.680 --> 42:06.920
she could have him.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.484
Little girl,

42:09.560 --> 42:12.404
Ave Maria don't stand a
chance next to Sweet Sue.

42:13.320 --> 42:16.767
Sweet Sue is a
saber-toothed divorcee

42:16.840 --> 42:18.285
in need of cash.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.802
And Jack Mac's
got him a steady job.

42:21.120 --> 42:22.849
He got no dependents.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.769
And when his mama passes,

42:24.880 --> 42:26.520
he gonna get that
house across the bridge.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.728
And don't forget,
since he was 18,

42:28.800 --> 42:30.848
he got that pension
from the miners.

42:32.240 --> 42:34.766
Now, when you look at a
situation like this... Mmm-hmm.

42:34.840 --> 42:37.491
You realize that
money in the bank

42:38.040 --> 42:40.168
means love in the heart.

42:40.880 --> 42:44.487
<i>You sure been seeing</i> a
<i>lot of that Sweet Sue lately.</i>

42:45.120 --> 42:47.407
Seems things are
getting serious.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.923
Son, have I been a good mother?

42:53.080 --> 42:54.605
Yes, ma'am.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.570
Good answer.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.524
Why do you ask?
Something wrong?

43:02.200 --> 43:05.727
This is one of them moments when
I wish your daddy was alive.

43:06.760 --> 43:08.171
Just say it, Ma.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.764
I don't want you to marry
Sweet Sue Tinsley.

43:18.440 --> 43:22.286
I haven't taught you the
difference between love and lust.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.682
See, true love energizes you.

43:25.520 --> 43:29.206
Lust and all them other kinds
of love just exhausts you.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.687
All right.
No, now listen to me.

43:31.760 --> 43:34.366
I mean, clearly, I failed you.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.964
Of course, anything and everything
that goes wrong with children

43:38.040 --> 43:39.371
is always the mother's fault.

43:40.320 --> 43:42.402
But let me embrace my failure.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.721
Why don't you marry
some nice girl

43:45.800 --> 43:47.882
instead of that
hotsy-totsy flaunter?

43:48.040 --> 43:51.044
I'll marry whomever
I please, Mama.

43:51.760 --> 43:53.728
Well, then explain this to me.

43:53.920 --> 43:56.207
Explain what you're
doing with your life.

43:58.400 --> 44:00.004
Mama, look at me.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.169
Everything's passed me by.

44:03.280 --> 44:06.250
That's not true.
You're a good man.

44:06.320 --> 44:07.890
I want what you and Daddy had.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.923
When I was young,
I had a handle on things.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.847
I knew who I was
and what I wanted.

44:19.760 --> 44:21.285
But I work in the dark.

44:22.920 --> 44:24.922
And I have for 22 years.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.169
When I come out of that mine,

44:28.360 --> 44:30.408
I don't want complications.

44:31.240 --> 44:33.641
I just want simple.

44:35.280 --> 44:38.011
Well, that is the word
I'd use to describe Sweet Sue.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.287
I know you don't
like her, Mama.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.011
But I love her boys,

44:46.120 --> 44:47.963
and she's nice to me.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.089
Well, you told me.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.522
So, if that's your choice,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.401
Sweet Sue will never
know my true feelings.

45:05.560 --> 45:07.210
Can I fix you some supper?

45:07.280 --> 45:09.282
No, ma'am,
I already have plans.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.645
Okay.

45:56.480 --> 45:58.448
I found the tissues.
You're too late.

46:00.480 --> 46:01.811
I see that.

46:03.480 --> 46:04.925
How about some apple butter?

46:05.360 --> 46:07.522
Mama just put this up,
wanted you to have some.

46:07.880 --> 46:09.848
Oh, that's very kind.
Thank you.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.485
Would you like to come in?

46:14.680 --> 46:16.125
Yes, ma'am.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.446
Well, how about
I make you a deal?

46:20.400 --> 46:21.890
Okay.

46:22.080 --> 46:24.128
If you quit calling me "ma'am,"

46:25.200 --> 46:26.725
I'll get you a beer.

46:28.840 --> 46:30.285
Deal.

46:33.880 --> 46:35.769
I remember the first time
I was in this house.

46:37.040 --> 46:39.281
Daddy fixed the electric
here, one summer.

46:40.480 --> 46:42.164
I don't remember
you being here.

46:44.040 --> 46:46.361
Your mama made us
red pepper sandwiches.

46:49.480 --> 46:51.130
Yeah. Um...

47:04.840 --> 47:06.888
This talking about food's
made me hungry.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.604
You want something to eat? Sure.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.482
Don't believe I got
that kind of time.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.770
What made you want to
go into the mines?

47:23.920 --> 47:25.922
Well, I couldn't wait.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.602
When I was a boy, my daddy
used to tell me stories.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.451
He used to describe the mine,

47:31.560 --> 47:33.130
and what it was like,

47:33.880 --> 47:36.087
how quiet it could be,

47:37.080 --> 47:38.605
how dark it was,

47:40.440 --> 47:42.886
how if you left it
set long enough,

47:42.960 --> 47:44.883
that black coal would
become diamonds.

47:49.920 --> 47:53.402
That seemed almost
magical to me.

47:54.760 --> 47:56.808
Do you get scared?

47:58.120 --> 48:00.566
Sure do.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.241
But you do it anyway.

48:06.040 --> 48:08.850
I'd never do much of
anything if I didn't do

48:08.920 --> 48:10.490
the thing I'm afraid of.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.645
Well, look who's at Carmine's.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.651
Evening, Earl.

48:18.840 --> 48:21.241
There's a special on
banana pudding tonight.

48:21.320 --> 48:22.481
Ooh.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.324
I highly recommend it.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.161
Y'all have a good meal.

48:37.240 --> 48:40.449
Well, reckon you better give
Sweet Sue a call before Earl does.

48:42.160 --> 48:44.640
You think I'm a two-timer?

48:45.960 --> 48:47.485
I broke up with Sue.

48:49.400 --> 48:52.483
I guess I felt alone
when I was with her.

48:55.960 --> 48:57.166
What is this?

48:59.840 --> 49:02.207
It's a bowl of soup
with a coal miner.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.966
Oh, that's a milk glass moon.

49:13.520 --> 49:15.284
You want to see it up close?

49:16.040 --> 49:18.520
I would dearly love to.
You got us a rocket ship?

49:18.640 --> 49:20.051
Oh, I got a better way.

49:21.840 --> 49:23.171
Take this.

49:24.320 --> 49:27.608
Your mama sewed a new lining in
it for me a couple of years back.

49:29.160 --> 49:31.322
She always used
satin inside coats.

49:31.400 --> 49:32.686
It was a signature.

49:38.480 --> 49:41.370
These are the best two seats
in this whole theater,

49:41.880 --> 49:46.090
seats 5 and 7, row G,

49:48.280 --> 49:49.520
to see the moon.

49:50.960 --> 49:53.440
You know your numbers
and your letters?

49:53.960 --> 49:55.610
Almost all.
Thanks, Miss Callahan.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.520
She did a right good job with you.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.170
She tried, but
I was distracted.

50:00.960 --> 50:03.566
See, I was sitting next to
this pretty Italian girl.

50:04.320 --> 50:07.449
I always appreciated
that you said my name right.

50:07.600 --> 50:10.490
Well, that's because
you matter to me.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.685
Ave, I've got a good job.

50:19.760 --> 50:21.000
I'm in pretty good shape.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.691
I mean, I eat too much
sometimes and I drink beer,

50:23.760 --> 50:25.410
but my heart's good,

50:25.480 --> 50:27.926
and I'm strong.

50:28.520 --> 50:32.002
I've got some money saved.
And I got a new truck.

50:33.360 --> 50:35.806
And I think we
should get married.

50:38.360 --> 50:40.203
Are you serious?

50:41.240 --> 50:44.323
You don't have to
answer right away.

50:45.520 --> 50:48.285
I don't want to
just get married.

50:50.160 --> 50:53.050
I'd like to have some fun.

50:54.040 --> 50:56.122
I mean, heck, I thought
I was fixing to.

50:57.280 --> 50:59.931
We got here, I was like, "I'd
like to make love to that man."

51:00.000 --> 51:02.002
Well, that's good.

51:02.120 --> 51:04.361
Well, then you had to go and ruin
it by asking me to marry you.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.090
I mean, my hopes were
high an hour ago.

51:06.160 --> 51:08.128
Well, let's get 'em back up there then.
Come on.

51:08.200 --> 51:09.247
Jack.

51:11.800 --> 51:14.041
Well, you've been kind enough to
tell me a little about yourself.

51:14.120 --> 51:15.565
I'll tell you something about me.
Is that all right?

51:15.640 --> 51:16.766
Yeah.

51:16.840 --> 51:18.842
Well, I'd like to be kissed.

51:19.840 --> 51:21.524
I'd like to be kissed
like Rhett Butler,

51:21.640 --> 51:23.961
in fact, kissed Scarlett O'Hara
while Atlanta was burning.

51:24.200 --> 51:25.486
I'd like to be held

51:26.280 --> 51:29.204
the way Heathcliff embraces
Catherine on the Moors.

51:30.160 --> 51:32.083
I'd like a passion so explosive

51:32.160 --> 51:34.527
it could burn
Thornfield Hall down.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.521
I'd like a man to look at me

51:37.600 --> 51:39.523
with the whole world
in his eyes,

51:41.560 --> 51:42.971
and know exactly what to do

51:43.040 --> 51:46.203
with the rest of him
to please me.

51:47.200 --> 51:50.522
Not just an old house
and a pack of stray dogs

51:50.600 --> 51:53.888
and a good pension
and a new, old truck.

51:56.240 --> 51:59.289
So, you can take your moon
and your bowl of soup

51:59.360 --> 52:02.284
and your marriage proposal and shop
'em around to some other girl,

52:02.360 --> 52:04.089
'cause it ain't me.

52:11.200 --> 52:13.441
Good Lord.

52:14.760 --> 52:16.444
Oh, come on. Get in the front.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.845
Ave, come on!

52:19.920 --> 52:22.048
I'm not gonna ride through
town with you in the back.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.244
Please.

52:30.600 --> 52:33.809
Fine. Be that way.

52:44.040 --> 52:45.201
Oh!

52:45.280 --> 52:47.169
Hey. Are you all right?

53:01.440 --> 53:02.441
Ah!

53:02.600 --> 53:06.491
Look who's here! Finally.
You're late! Again!

53:06.560 --> 53:08.483
That's enough from you.
On the road.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.164
I want you to hit your marks

53:10.240 --> 53:11.651
and do not screw
this up for me.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.287
Now, get over there!
It's here. That bus!

53:14.480 --> 53:16.608
Everybody, come on,
storm the Bastille!

53:23.520 --> 53:25.010
Come on. Everyone,
get in place.

53:26.440 --> 53:28.522
Cleopatra! Cleopatra!

53:28.640 --> 53:30.400
You need to bring it down
just a touch, Earl.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.886
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

53:34.480 --> 53:37.768
Damn it, John. This was supposed
to be fried chicken, in and out.

53:38.880 --> 53:40.086
Yes. Let me have this.

53:40.160 --> 53:42.401
Is everyone in place
for the show?

53:42.480 --> 53:43.561
Tayloe?

53:47.000 --> 53:48.809
Maggie the Cat! Maggie the Cat!

53:49.960 --> 53:52.042
Here she comes. Here she comes.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.484
Oh! Sorry, sorry.

53:59.360 --> 54:02.489
<i>Miss Taylor! I want to be
your next husband!</i>

54:12.160 --> 54:13.366
No, don't!

54:20.960 --> 54:24.521
<i>Miss Taylor, Miss Taylor,
Johnny Wood, WCYB-TV.</i>

54:24.600 --> 54:27.604
<i>You've been married
9, 12, 10 times.</i>

54:27.680 --> 54:29.284
<i>Why so many husbands?</i>

54:29.960 --> 54:32.201
<i>You should always take
a chance on love.</i>

54:42.080 --> 54:44.082
Fried chicken, Miss Taylor?

55:01.960 --> 55:03.485
Spit it out!

55:04.160 --> 55:05.491
Where's Doc Miranda at?

55:05.560 --> 55:06.686
Elizabeth Taylor's
choking on a chicken!

55:06.760 --> 55:07.886
Oh, my God!

55:10.240 --> 55:12.686
<i>Elizabeth Taylor's
visit to Big Stone Gap, Virginia,</i>

55:12.760 --> 55:15.491
<i>ends not with a bang,
but a choking.</i>

55:15.560 --> 55:17.801
<i>While sampling
the local fried chicken,</i>

55:17.880 --> 55:22.363
<i>Liz Taylor swallowed bone and is being
taken to Lonesome Pine Hospital.</i>

55:22.440 --> 55:25.410
<i>This is Johnny Wood,
live for WCYB-TV</i>

55:25.480 --> 55:27.482
<i>in Big Stone Gap, Virginia.</i>

55:27.560 --> 55:29.608
Good luck. Talk less.

55:30.240 --> 55:32.891
At least you're not the biggest
disaster of the night.

55:35.320 --> 55:37.243
What do you say we go home,

55:37.320 --> 55:38.890
and I'll let you
beat me at rummy.

55:41.080 --> 55:43.208
That's the last thing
in the world I want to do.

55:50.080 --> 55:52.208
Have you seen Theodore?
He's despondent.

55:52.280 --> 55:54.044
Honey-O, I got some news.

55:54.160 --> 55:55.525
Marty Gilley from
the jewelry store

55:55.600 --> 55:57.045
told me Jack Mac bought a ring.

55:57.120 --> 55:59.407
One karat, two baguettes
for Sweet Sue.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.008
You look awful nice.

56:03.600 --> 56:05.762
You gave Sweet Sue
Tinsley a ring?

56:06.440 --> 56:07.851
I know it seems sort of sudden.

56:07.920 --> 56:10.002
Sudden? I'd call
that lickety-split.

56:10.720 --> 56:13.246
What'd you do, get some out of a
gumball machine that's adjustable,

56:13.320 --> 56:15.641
try it on every finger in town
till somebody said yes?

56:15.760 --> 56:17.649
Now you're just being unkind.
Unkind.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.730
Man of few words, it doesn't
take many to find the right one.

56:23.040 --> 56:25.281
I tried with you!

56:26.680 --> 56:29.809
Tried? Like tried,
like what? On a job?

56:30.680 --> 56:32.728
I'm a coal miner.

56:32.800 --> 56:35.201
That's a lot easier
work than you.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.082
Can I ask you something?
Mmm-hmm.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.923
Are you happy?

56:53.560 --> 56:56.723
Darlin', happiness is a myth.

56:58.600 --> 57:01.410
I got married when
I was 15-years-old.

57:02.160 --> 57:03.525
I got me five kids.

57:05.480 --> 57:07.642
One a bigger disappointment
than the next.

57:07.720 --> 57:10.166
My grand kids ain't
much better, neither.

57:10.280 --> 57:13.409
'Course when you plant corn,
you get corn.

57:17.840 --> 57:20.411
If you could live your life over,
what would you do different?

57:22.080 --> 57:25.687
I'd marry me Twyla Johnson
instead of the wife I got.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.567
Twyla was the one
that got away.

57:30.640 --> 57:33.610
We all got one,
you know. You know.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.287
That person that
we ought to be with,

57:38.360 --> 57:39.725
we know we ought to be with,

57:40.560 --> 57:42.608
but circumstances have a way of

57:45.280 --> 57:47.567
working out where you

57:47.640 --> 57:50.530
get sidetracked
and end up settling.

57:53.560 --> 57:55.642
Do you ever see Twyla?

57:58.040 --> 58:02.125
We do have lunch every Tuesday.

58:05.080 --> 58:07.447
My Tuesdays are content.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.567
One out of seven days,

58:11.640 --> 58:13.404
I live the dream.

58:16.680 --> 58:19.365
What you gonna do with yourself, girl?
Come here.

58:20.240 --> 58:23.323
Come on here with Spec.
Give him a big hug. Mmm!

58:35.280 --> 58:37.806
We don't want no trouble, Ava.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.081
What are you doing here?

58:42.600 --> 58:44.568
This is my family home.

58:45.120 --> 58:48.249
I want you to leave.
The truth has come out.

58:49.040 --> 58:51.884
Now I know your mama
done come clean with you.

58:52.200 --> 58:55.010
You ain't our kin.
You never been blood.

58:56.200 --> 58:59.363
I know what you are.
And that's a bastard.

58:59.720 --> 59:01.848
When I think what your
mother done to my family,

59:01.920 --> 59:04.969
it almost killed my mama when
Fred came home with a wop.

59:05.800 --> 59:08.724
He married her out of pity,
'cause she was knocked up.

59:08.800 --> 59:12.361
My brother done educated you, clothed
you and fed you like you was his.

59:12.640 --> 59:14.847
You lived like a princess
here in my family home,

59:14.920 --> 59:17.048
with trips to Monticello
and so forth,

59:17.120 --> 59:20.761
while I never done
got as far as Roanoke.

59:25.200 --> 59:28.170
I'll see you in court.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.162
You give me my key.

59:34.320 --> 59:35.970
Come on, Wayne.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.684
We just want what's
coming to us.

59:51.600 --> 59:53.523
Can I have a grilled
cheese sandwich, tapioca pudding

59:53.600 --> 59:55.045
and a coconut cake?

59:55.120 --> 59:56.610
Black coffee for me. Thanks.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.209
I'm sorry I left you
stranded last night, Ave,

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.521
but we need to talk.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.246
Okay. About what?

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.201
Well, I was gonna wait
to tell you this, but, um...

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.770
I just got offered
the band director job

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.370
at the University of Tennessee.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.690
Chattanooga, so don't get too excited.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.281
That's amazing.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.443
Well, what's gonna
happen to us?

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.250
We can't do this anymore.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.521
No, we can't, can we?

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.847
We can't go around pretending we're just...
We're like other people.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.088
Yeah, exactly. Oh, my
God, it's exhausting.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.207
It sure is.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.040
Oh, Ave.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.729
You don't want me.
I'm a bad bet.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.924
I have quirks.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.004
You know, I'm persnickety
and I'm churlish.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.128
I'm moody, cranky,
impossible, I'm...

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.323
And you know I have
a terrible background.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.131
Half my family drinks,
and the other half

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.687
hit the people who drink.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.610
Theodore,

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.441
do you like men?

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.649
And there's that, too.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.289
Hope y'all are hungry!

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.525
Don't forget the coconut cake.
Coming right up!

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.446
<i>Did you see that Liz Taylor
sent</i> a <i>check to the hospital</i>

01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.931
<i>to thank 'em for
saving her life?</i>

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.367
I did and I felt
so bad for her.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.887
But I tell you what,
I voted for her husband.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.531
First time I ever
voted Republican.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.647
And he won.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.925
Which just goes to show you,
every vote counts.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.691
Hey, Miss Ave. Do you need
help with any of those...

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.529
She ain't in her right mind.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.003
<i>I'm worried about Ave Maria.</i>

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.409
<i>Iva Lou says she
ain't been sleeping,</i>

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.289
<i>and I can see
she ain't been eating.</i>

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.165
<i>She just don't look good.</i>

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.561
Jack? Bring down
that last tree.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.690
You have to put it
in the front hall.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.487
Now, Mary Beth,
grab them balls.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.880
This is the best Christmas
show ever, Mrs. MacChesney.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.361
Ma'am?

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.602
This show'll be spectacular.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.881
Feeling all right?

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.122
Ave Maria, I almost
gave up on you.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.170
Hey, ladies. Start stringing
these extra lights.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.363
Listen. You gotta do something.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.286
Sweet Sue is planning a New
Year's Eve wedding to my son.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.442
They're gonna get married right
in front of that fireplace

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.284
while the tree is still up.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.442
Now, he is the marrying kind,

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.204
and he will never leave her

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.601
once that ring
is on his finger.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.810
He's just like his fool daddy.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.645
You can love him or beat him.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.529
But either way he'd stay.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.841
Now, please help me give her
the big heave-ho.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.050
Do you hear me, Ave Maria?

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.962
You're gonna miss
your chance with my son.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.005
Ave?

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.803
<i>Ave, are you okay?</i>

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.960
<i>Doc, what's happened to her?</i>

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.722
This is what we call
an old-fashioned nervous breakdown.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.528
What, do we take her
up to Lonesome Pine?

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.161
No, her vitals are normal.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.571
There's no reason to
take her to the hospital.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.770
Then why's she laying there
like a bag of rocks?

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.770
That's for her to figure out.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.285
I'll come and check her in the morning.
Just let her sleep.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400
Might be a good idea if you
don't smoke around her.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.527
Okay. There comes a time
in every woman's life

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.971
when she's gotta face her fear.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.641
I know. I know.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.449
All right, whose time
is it now?

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.007
It's mine. It's my time.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.129
Good. Now. A woman
with a purpose

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.726
is worth 10 men
with the same, okay?

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.723
Now, I'm not gonna tell you
exactly what to say to him,

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.485
but I am gonna tell you
how to say it, all right?

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.410
You're gonna march up to Jack
MacChesney, and you're gonna say,

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.323
"I need to talk to you, sir."

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.887
And he's gonna hem and haw and "yep"
and "nope" and look right past you,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.650
like the shower after
the shift is more important

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.489
than the information
you need to relay.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.121
But you are to ignore
all of that.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.361
All right? All right.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.761
Men are bad at communicating,
but they actually have ears.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.007
So you just need to state
your piece, you know,

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.491
get into that
little brain of his,

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.121
'cause he's actually
a pretty smart guy.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.402
I happen to know that, 'cause
he checked out Quo Vadis,

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.520
from the Bookmobile and that
there's a door stopper.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:23.210
You just think of Ave Maria,

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.568
and all she done for you.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.048
And that'll fuel your ambition
to tell him what's what.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.921
Okay? Okay,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.331
All right now, scoot!

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.845
Get your books on the way back.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.366
Mr. MacChesney.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.284
Mr. MacChesney? See you
later, Mr. MacChesney.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.647
We're gonna save you
some water, Mr. MacChesney.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.006
Please do. Please do.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.281
What is it, Pearl?

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.250
It's about Ave Maria.
She's still asleep.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.889
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.530
She loves you.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.801
She say something to you?

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.326
No, sir. And she
don't know it yet.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.528
But according to the ancient
art of Chinese face reading...

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.681
Oh, come on.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.922
According to the ancient art
of Chinese face reading,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.764
the bridge of her nose
and yours match

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.241
which makes you
besotted, true lovers.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.964
You handled her all wrong.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.281
Pearl, I appreciate your
interest, but you're wrong.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.331
She don't want me. She done
told me herself.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.562
And if there's one thing
I know about women,

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.960
it's when they tell you something,
they mean it. Thank you.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.767
No! Not Ave Maria.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.251
She buries her feelings.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.004
Doc thinks that's why she
had that nervous breakdown.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.447
Well, what do you want me
to do about it, Pearl?

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.408
Well, I don't know.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.209
I was hoping you could
think of something.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.324
Go on, get on.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.001
So?

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.243
I don't know, Miss Iva Lou.
He seemed awful angry.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.569
Passion in the pit.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.927
That's the good news! Let's go.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.004
Ave Maria.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.884
Ave Maria.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.399
Carissima, Ave Maria.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:35.404
<i>By the time you read this,
I will be gone.</i>

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.921
<i>Please know that of all the
things I ever had to do,</i>

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.491
<i>leaving you here without me
is the most difficult.</i>

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:50.124
<i>High in the Italian Alps,
you have a family.</i>

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:53.283
<i>Your father is there,
and my sister.</i>

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.010
<i>I was too ashamed and
never told them about you.</i>

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.209
<i>But you deserve every
good thing in this life.</i>

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.521
<i>All the things
I could not give you,</i>

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.602
<i>for my own reasons.</i>

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.727
Papa!

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.166
She's up!

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.123
Good God almighty. She's up!

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.366
Come here!

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.565
Ave? She's awake!

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.563
What happened?

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.849
Fleeta, she's awake!

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.611
Ave!

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.009
It is so cold here.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.161
Honey.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.241
Here, bundle up.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.560
You're back.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.080
You done come out
of your deep sleep.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.524
Oh, Spec.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.528
Spec, I'm leaving.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.201
I'm going to Italy.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.250
I'm going to Schilpario,
way up in the Italian Alps.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.280
I've been telling you for
years to go on vacation.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.161
No.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.723
I saw my father in a dream.
And I have to go find him.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.728
You know, you need to
calm down a little bit.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:23.966
Take a deep breath.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.488
I don't know what pills
Doc Daugherty been giving her,

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.728
but it's making
that girl crazy.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.971
<i>Listen up, Ave.</i>

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.169
<i>Before you leave for Italy, we've gotta
get everything out of your name.</i>

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.049
<i>Even that old Cadillac.</i>

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.040
<i>All right, hand me the pen.</i>

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.688
Howdy, Miss Grimes,
you remember me?

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.084
Sure do, Miss Ave.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.085
How's your soap coming?

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.166
Good, good. I'll have my
Pearl bring you some.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.966
Well, if you'd let me, I'd
love to sell some at Mutual's.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.610
I think people'd like that.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.491
That'd be right nice.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.921
She home?

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.601
She out back.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.327
Coming, Mama!

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.963
She been trying any of that
miraculous face cream on you?

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.121
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.008
I used to be pretty,
'fore I lost my teeth.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.726
They say little things
don't matter,

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.608
but they matter
if they your teeth.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.328
You could get you
some new teeth in town.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.328
Someday, right, Mama?

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.445
Sure.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.284
Can I have a word, Pearl?

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:52.607
Mama, can I go?

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.970
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.889
Do you happen to have a dollar?

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.642
Um, yeah, you just paid me.
I got 46.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.131
Here, you need anymore?

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.370
Just the one'll do.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.121
Okay.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.204
Congratulations, dear.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.162
You just bought
yourself a drugstore.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.688
Miss Ave, I don't understand.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:22.168
Spec said I had to sell Mutual's
or it'd be took from me.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.963
So, I looked around
and I thought,

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.769
"Who deserves a good turn?"

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.291
"Who knows not just
what a customer needs"

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.044
"but what she secretly wants?"

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.810
"Who has just the right touch
with that insecure lady,"

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:41.807
"who's worn red lipstick all her life and
could be pushed to try the hot pink?"

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.369
"Who treats her mommy
like the treasure she is?"

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.681
"Who knows everybody on those
ridges and is willing to walk"

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.449
"to take them their medicine
when I can't get there?"

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.887
You're the best person
I know, Pearl.

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.650
And I hope you'll keep
using that head of yours

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.131
the way you have been because

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.961
that store will be enough to get you
through college and make you a good life.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.123
But, Miss Ave, what about you?

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.124
I'll tell you a secret.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.971
An elegant guest knows
when to leave the party.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.845
Mama!

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.965
Who is it?

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.485
Fleeta.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.642
Well, I just want to
make sure it was you,

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.563
'cause it is time to negotiate.

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.241
'Cause if I'm gonna have to
work for this little girl,

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.362
and a Melungeon at that,

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.728
I feel I should be, well,
compensated for my duress.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.925
You sure about this number?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.001
Yes, ma'am.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.006
Then they are gonna have
to carry me outta here.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.081
Thank you.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.648
I want you to look after Pearl.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.968
You know this business
better than anybody.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.610
Just teach her proper.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.881
I will.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.486
Happy?

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.170
I'm very happy-

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.243
I'm gonna buy Krifflum a horse.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.885
Come on in.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.009
<i>Wise County Bookmobile.</i>

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.481
<i>Next stop, Mutual's Pharmacy.</i>

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.130
I have news!

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.361
Iva Lou!

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:40.004
Lyle Makin asked me to marry
him and I said, "Yes!"

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.570
Oh, tra-la. Tra-la, tra-la.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.125
Will you be my maid of honor?

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.441
No.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.887
Oh... Not you.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.325
Ave Maria.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.641
Honey, I would love
to stand with you.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.241
Honey.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.409
So, you're pregnant?

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.891
Lyle, keep it together.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.804
You wouldn't know about
me and Iva Lou, now?

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.326
Yep-

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.529
Come on, you, it's time!

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.331
Oh, you look beautiful.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.484
I hate wearing white.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.881
Do I look washed out?

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.086
You don't. You don't.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.924
You're not exactly
blushing, but you're,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.001
uh, ruddy.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.324
I can't do this, Ave.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.441
Hey-

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.568
Shoot. Iva Lou,
you been drinking?

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.924
Is he drunk? Groom's drunk.

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.241
Ave!

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.521
Hold him up, Jack.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.490
Then the two shall be one.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.601
Amen.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.600
Hang on! Don't make
me go in there.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.201
Hi, Miss Nellie.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:51.447
Think pink!

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.965
Oh, how could we not?

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.041
Not yet, not yet!

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.167
I'm not ready!

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.241
No!

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.601
You okay, Lyle?

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.728
All right, darling.
Let's get you married.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.160
Lord have mercy.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.726
Is anybody at this wedding sober?
Doesn't look like it.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.564
Where is he? Where is he?

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.291
He's right here. No.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.401
Preacher, I think we're ready.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.960
Let's do this, we got them.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.442
Hurry! <i>I now pronounce
you man and wife.</i>

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.528
You know, this was the dumbest
wedding I've ever seen.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.685
I mean, every... People that
old just ought to elope.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.209
I heard it was touching.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.244
Sure, it was touching,
if you like wrestling.

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.760
Hey, Mama.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.885
Hi, Miss Fleeta.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:58.961
How you doing?

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.926
Mama, show Miss Fleeta.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.361
What?

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.444
Let me see. Oh,
those look good, girl!

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.565
Those look good!

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.004
Well, now I'm seeing that
being pretty has its benefits.

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.368
That's right. 'Cause you know,
every woman's beautiful.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.409
Now, some is
prettier than others.

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.289
But all women are beautiful.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.086
Hey. Would you care to dance?

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.526
Um...

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.042
Well, I think I bruised
my hip in the fall

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.441
and in these shoes my feet
are a couple of bloody stumps.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.965
So, no thank you.

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.810
You want a bag of ice?

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.651
Where is she?

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.565
Where is she? Where is she?

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.369
I'm right here, Aunt Alice.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.169
You may think you won,

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.165
but you ain't, Ava Marie.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.290
You are not gonna ruin this
wedding reception, Aunt Alice.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.010
It ain't like anybody's
gonna remember it anyway.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.322
You gave my brother's
pharmacy to Pearl Grimes.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.046
I sure did. That belongs
to me and my family.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:02.167
Not anymore.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.366
Well, that may be gone.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.807
But I want this house back,
and I'm gonna get it.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.367
Oh, Aunt Alice.
You're just awful.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.851
You're about to
ruin my surprise.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.849
Pearl! Get in here, hon.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.927
It would not be right for you to own a
business in town and have to tote yourself

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.604
all the way back and
forth from Insko.

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.206
And I don't want you to be away
from your mommy that much.

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.569
This house is yours.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.729
Oh, my God! Miss Ave?
You giving us the house?

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.201
Oh, I hope you live here
in joy and peace.

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.406
You sweet little thing.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.488
You done give my house
to that Melungeon?

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.329
My mama's Melungeon.
That's right.

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.130
Mine is too.
I married a Melungeon.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.680
I'm a Melungeon.
I'm a Melungeon, too.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.963
I think it's time for you
two to turn tail and leave.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.680
You've done about
insulted everybody here.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.127
Including the Melungeons.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.282
The newly married.
The newly married.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.885
The black folks. Blacks.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.405
The educated. Mmm-hmm.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.561
The bachelors.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:58.767
Them, too.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.126
Come on, now.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.168
Scoot before the Cherokees
get a vote. Come on.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.967
You're a gall-damned
Italian thief!

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.122
Oh, Aunt Alice!
For once and for all,

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.281
it is not.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.970
I-talian!

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.246
It's Italian.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.761
That's right.
You tell her, honey.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.564
Come on, now, scoot.
Scoot. Go on!

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.850
Bye-bye. Bye, Alice.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.731
Go on, get out!

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.288
I never worried about
Alice Lambert.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.203
Her face reading?
Tilt of her nose says

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.044
she'd never win.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.446
You did the right thing.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.202
Come on,
everybody, let's dance.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.764
Hi, Ava.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:45.086
Sweet Sue. It's Ave.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.570
I love this cake.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.005
I gotta find out
who the baker is

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:53.209
because I want to have it
for the renewal of my vows.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.128
I got back together with Mike.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.209
I didn't know that.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.967
It happened around the time
of your mental collapse.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.520
He loves me.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.443
And he's crazy about
the boys, and

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.962
well, I hate being alone.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.808
I need to work off
all this cake.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.008
Mike, let's do the hustle!

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.008
What happened to
your pink dress?

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.441
Um...

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.841
It was cutting
off my circulation.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.688
You gonna stay
mad at me forever?

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.725
I'm not mad at you. No?

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:34.364
If I were mad at you,
it'd suggest I was angry.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.442
And if I were angry, it would
mean I had feelings for you,

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.126
and you're a reasonably
nice person, but see?

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.290
No feelings.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.371
For somebody who don't
have any feelings,

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.090
you sure talk about it a lot.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.170
Aren't you the expert?

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.364
All I'm saying is
I don't believe you.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.766
It's your choice.

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:58.050
It means that much to you, to
hang on to your judgment of me?

01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.481
I must scare you.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.282
Uh... Oh, no, sir.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.165
Then you'll come with me?

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.326
Where?

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.171
I've got something
for you in my truck.

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.368
I bet you do.
Put your cake down.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.729
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Put your cake down.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.241
I'm busy. Put your cake down.
Come on.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.364
Come on.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.209
Where in the world did you find this?

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.804
It was an ordeal.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.289
Had to figure out
how to spell it first.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.522
<i>Schilpario, A Life
in the Mountains.</i>

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.323
This is my father's hometown.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.568
I special ordered it
from Richmond.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.569
I figured it'd be of some use
to you when you go to Italy.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.921
Thank you.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.330
You're entirely welcome.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.243
I owe you an apology-

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.485
For what?

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.807
I haven't been
very nice to you.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.206
Well, why is that?

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.530
I don't know.

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.683
I have an idea why.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.240
Well, why do you think?

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.403
You don't want anybody or
anything to keep you here.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.682
That's partly right.

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.208
I'm also just being
honest with myself.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.044
I've given everything
I have to this place,

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.691
and it hasn't made me happy.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:02.762
You think happiness
is out there somewhere?

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.248
If I didn't believe that,
I wouldn't be going.

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.282
Do you think you'll
ever come back?

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.765
<i>You know 'm the Outdoor Drama</i>

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.524
when Jack Hale,
the mining engineer,

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.887
sends June Tolliver, the poor
girl from the mountains,

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.325
off to be educated?

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.529
She goes to
the Bluegrass of Kentucky

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.807
and she learns how to

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.485
talk, and culture,
manners, how to dress.

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.328
And then when she comes home,
she doesn't fit in anymore.

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:46.723
I'm hoping that's
what'll happen to me.

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:51.168
I want to see and do
so much that it changes me.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.366
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.603
And then I won't
want to come back.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.328
At least that's
what I'm hoping.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.371
Well, what if I told you
that I wanted you to stay?

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.968
Long time ago you asked me

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.486
if I was scared of anything
and I didn't answer.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.247
I knew even then
what I was afraid of.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.081
I'm afraid I'm gonna spend
my whole life without you.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.208
I better go back inside.

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.727
Thank you so much for the book.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.250
Howdy. Hey.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.570
Looks different, doesn't it?

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.041
Mmm-hmm.

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.521
I hate goodbyes.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.005
I'm gonna miss you, Spec.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.410
I'm gonna miss you, too.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.970
I've never been
friends with a woman.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:54.040
I didn't think it was possible.

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.208
But you changed that.

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.322
I could tell you
whatever I was thinking.

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:11.604
And I just want you to know
that I will treasure that.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.968
And you.

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.687
Aw...

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.331
Have I arrived in time
to see Spec Broadwater

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:33.006
weep melancholy tears
of sadness and regret?

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.204
You have not, fancy pants.
I've come to pick up a chair.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.642
All right, well,
I guess I will help.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.405
Where does the rest
of this stuff go?

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.488
Furniture's all going to
Sacred Heart Church,

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.721
and anything left
in the kitchen

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.802
to Reverend Mother's
Food Pantry.

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.051
I'm taking this with me.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.485
It suits you.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.042
Ah, and then I'm gonna take you
out for hot dogs at the Hob Knob,

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.400
and if you're
a really good girl,

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.169
for some donuts at Cab's.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.961
Can I have it frosted?

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.411
Yes, you may have it frosted.

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.084
And then you have to
get a good night's sleep,

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:05.289
because we have a very big day
planned for your last day here

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.010
in Big Stone Gap.

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.406
We don't have time for this.

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.768
No, no, come on. Come on, your
flight doesn't leave until tonight.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.525
Just one more stop.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.241
Besides, you just can't leave
without saying goodbye

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.930
to the Outdoor Drama.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.771
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.526
Everybody, settle down now.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.569
We've got an
announcement to make.

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:13.091
Honey-O.

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.926
There's somebody
we want you to meet.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.883
Papa.

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.051
There's more, darling.

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.485
Uh-uh, I can't take more.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.369
I know you can't,
but we got it for you.

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:19.046
We found your mama's sister.

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:24.444
This is your Zia Maria Luisa.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:29.887
Ave Maria!

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:36.123
Thank God I'm wearing
my waterproof Great Lash.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.723
How did you find me?

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.565
I was just fixing to
come look for you.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:49.168
I received a letter.

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:53.164
From, uh...

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.405
Jack MacChesney.

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.204
He told me

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.164
about your mama

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.801
and the kind of lady
she became.

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.328
He told me about you,

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.688
the kind of girl you were,

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.851
and the kind of lady
you became.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:16.122
And he said that

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.530
the one thing that
could bring you peace

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.684
was to know your father.

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.769
He sent the tickets.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.410
He made all the arrangements.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:30.690
How did you do that,
Jack MacChesney?

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.683
You're a coal miner,
not a king.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:35.209
I sold my truck.

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.522
You love that truck.

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.201
Yeah, but I've loved you
since the sixth grade.

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:02.960
<i>So Ave Maria
and I got married.</i>

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.522
<i>We made a home
and built a life.</i>

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.528
<i>We had two beautiful children.</i>

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.801
<i>I worked in the mines
till they closed,</i>

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:16.089
<i>and Ave Maria delivered medicine
until the Jeep wore out.</i>

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.442
<i>We held on when times got bad,</i>

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.601
<i>and didn't let go
when they got worse.</i>

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.368
<i>Life was good in Big Stone Gap.</i>

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:27.244
<i>But it wasn't perfect.</i>

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.449
<i>Well, you know how that goes.</i>

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.323
<i>Life's only perfect
in the movies.</i>
