WEBVTT

00:11.960 --> 00:14.280
[alarm ringing]

00:16.880 --> 00:18.560
[in Norwegian]
Okay!

00:29.280 --> 00:31.800
What the fuck do we do
with all this other shit?

00:33.720 --> 00:36.000
Forty seconds to go!

00:39.840 --> 00:41.080
[man 1]
We're taking everything.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.080
[man 2]
Take everything?

00:43.160 --> 00:46.000
[theme music playing]

01:18.920 --> 01:22.960
[emcee] Let me welcome
the Leading Light of the Year:

01:23.040 --> 01:25.320
Johnny Henriksen!

01:25.400 --> 01:27.600
[all cheering]

01:31.120 --> 01:34.360
[Johnny in Norwegian]
Thank you. Thank you.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.160
[in English]
Hey. What can I say?

01:40.840 --> 01:42.840
Thank you, my friend.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.800
[all cheer]

01:46.320 --> 01:48.440
What a crazy ride it's been.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.440
Johnny!

01:51.720 --> 01:56.720
A big thanks to all that voted for me.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.120
You're very wise.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.760
[crowd chuckles]

01:59.840 --> 02:05.880
And, uh, my eternal gratitude

02:05.960 --> 02:08.480
to the one Norwegian

02:08.560 --> 02:11.160
that made all of this possible:

02:11.240 --> 02:14.000
Johann Olav Koss.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.480
[crowd cheers]

02:15.560 --> 02:20.040
It was his run in '94

02:20.120 --> 02:22.840
that, uh,
introduced this place to me.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.240
Lilyhammer.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.640
Thank you.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.920
[crowd cheering]

02:29.000 --> 02:31.800
[emcee in Norwegian] And now,
Gaute OrmÃ¥sen will play a song for us.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.320
[playing up-tempo melody]

02:35.400 --> 02:37.360
[Johnny chuckles]

02:37.440 --> 02:40.240
- [in English] All right. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.560
Yeah, congrats.

02:44.640 --> 02:48.000
- Anything wrong?
- No, no. No.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.840
There's no problem.
No worries.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.200
[Arne in Norwegian]
Be quiet, guys. Listen to the music.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.840
[Johnny in English]
All right.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.760
Congratulations, man.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.560
Hey, baby.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.360
- [speaks Norwegian]
- Thank you. Thank you.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.760
Oh-ho!

03:08.840 --> 03:10.400
You know it, baby.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.600
I got it. Here it is.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.840
The gold.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.520
[in Norwegian]
Hi. Lars. Lars Olafsen.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.760
I'm chairman of the Flame Award.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.880
[in English] Oh. Welcome
to my humble establishment.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.640
[Lars]
Congratulations.

03:25.720 --> 03:29.680
Thanking Johann Olav Koss,
that was, yeah, beautiful.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.920
- He's a great guy.
- You two tight?

03:33.000 --> 03:36.160
Yeah, you know, he came with me
to climb the  Chomolungma.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.440
The mountain
people in the West call Everest.

03:41.520 --> 03:46.000
Oh. Nice to know somebody
that knows him. He's a legend.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.400
But, Johnny, listen, me and some
other guys with a little bit of success,

03:49.480 --> 03:52.960
we're having this lutefisk
gathering in a few days.

03:53.040 --> 03:56.160
Why don't you and your guys join us, huh?

03:56.240 --> 03:57.800
We'll think about it.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.920
[in Norwegian]
Not a lot of business decisions

04:02.000 --> 04:03.840
get made around this town

04:03.920 --> 04:07.320
without him having a say in them.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.400
[in English] This thing could be
a real door-opener, huh?

04:10.480 --> 04:13.360
[soul music playing over speakers]

04:15.200 --> 04:18.640
Where's the mope?

04:18.720 --> 04:20.360
Look at this.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.560
What's the matter with you,
you fucking mope?

04:29.640 --> 04:33.520
I got Lars Olafsen over here
wanting to meet my managing director.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.960
[in Norwegian] Is Lars Olafsen here?
The entrepreneur?

04:41.200 --> 04:43.240
[in Italian]  Mamma mia!

04:43.320 --> 04:46.240
[in English] How do I look?
Do I look okay?

04:46.320 --> 04:48.200
You're beautiful.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.960
[Johnny] Lars, I want to introduce you
to my managing director.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.720
[in English] Torgeir Lien.
It's such an honor, sir.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.560
[in Norwegian]
You know I'm Norwegian, right?

05:03.640 --> 05:05.960
[in English]
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.320
[in Norwegian]
I have seen you before.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.320
Do you go climbing,
down at the gym?

05:09.400 --> 05:12.880
[in Norwegian] No, I'm enrolled
in your class. The entrepreneur thing.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.080
Right. Good.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.000
You know,
me and the boys were talking

05:17.080 --> 05:20.360
about that, uh,
fish party you invited us to.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.680
- Yeah. The lutefisk?
- [Johnny] That's the one.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.400
Why not have it right here?

05:27.360 --> 05:29.720
[in Norwegian]
Here? What do you say, Alf?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.800
Would it be all right
to try something new?

05:31.880 --> 05:34.760
- Oh, you've already been served?
- Yeah, thanks, Trond.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.720
We were just talking about having
the fish dinner here this year.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.760
Here? But what about Fjellstugu?

05:40.840 --> 05:44.760
We're at that restaurant
of yours every damn year.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.280
Yeah? It's a tradition.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.080
[Lars] Tradition is great, Trond, but...

05:49.160 --> 05:53.400
[in English] It sure wasn't traditions
that brought the Olympics to this town.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.280
That was, you know...

05:56.360 --> 05:57.640
[in Norwegian]
Innovation.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.360
[in English]
So, it's settled then.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.480
[in Norwegian]
Cheers.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.160
[all]
Cheers.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.200
[in English]
My friends need a refill.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.680
Bollinger's all right.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.080
Whoa, slow down, buddy.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.760
[in Norwegian]
If you take my fish dinner,

06:17.840 --> 06:20.600
it might be that I have to have
a talk with someone.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.600
[in English]
I'm experienced enough to understand

06:23.680 --> 06:28.000
that the merchandise you're selling here
is not exactly from the state monopoly.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.880
- I understand.
- [in Norwegian] I thought so.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.920
[whistling]

07:00.520 --> 07:02.920
[grunts]

07:07.280 --> 07:09.840
[in English] Aw, somebody help
the poor guy up.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.600
[in Norwegian] You need to straighten out
your foreign friend here.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.640
He doesn't seem fully integrated.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.840
[in English]
Integrate this.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.600
Oh, Jesus!

07:25.680 --> 07:27.360
Oh... oh.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.280
I said the balls. The balls.

07:30.360 --> 07:33.000
I was aiming for the balls.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.280
[Johnny] All right, boys.
Explain to him what's what.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.840
[muffled screaming]

07:59.000 --> 08:00.960
[Trond grunting]

08:05.440 --> 08:07.280
[in Norwegian] What do you think
of Johnny Henriksen?

08:07.360 --> 08:10.320
He's an important contributor
to the community in Lillehammer.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.920
And the Flamingo?

08:13.560 --> 08:16.960
[Trond] Flamingo serves the best lutefisk
in the whole of Oppland County.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.280
There you go,
that wasn't so difficult, was it?

08:31.320 --> 08:34.440
Here is dramatic footage
from yesterday's robbery

08:34.520 --> 08:37.560
where four men disguised
as Justin Bieber...

08:37.640 --> 08:41.200
[in Norwegian] Who the fuck robs a bank
disguised as a teen idol?

08:41.280 --> 08:44.800
Now, I think you are being
too harsh on young Justin.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.760
After all, his last record
has a lot of catchy hits.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.520
Oh, you have become a Belieber?

08:49.600 --> 08:52.120
I just think, after he started
cooperating with Usher,

08:52.200 --> 08:53.680
he has developed a lot.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.480
- Belieber.
- [Roar] Cocksucker!

08:55.560 --> 08:59.360
[in English] Hey. So how'd we do
with Gordon Ramsay?

08:59.440 --> 09:02.320
Well, uh, he pooed in his pants.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.400
[in Norwegian] So I think we managed
to convey that silence is golden.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.800
[bartender in English]
There you go.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.760
[chuckles]

09:10.840 --> 09:13.600
What the fuck is this?

09:13.680 --> 09:15.800
What, are we a bunch of sorority girls?

09:15.880 --> 09:17.520
Bring out the real booze.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.760
[in Norwegian]
That's all the liquor that's left.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.680
But Roy said that there was
a delivery due yesterday.

09:22.760 --> 09:26.320
That's right, he called me
and said he was sick.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.040
[in English] And you were gonna inform me
of this exactly when?

09:47.640 --> 09:50.280
[in Norwegian] It's not like
I'm an exercise freak or nothing,

09:50.360 --> 09:53.560
but the doctor told me to train my back.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.320
In that case,
there's only one thing to do: Zumba.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.480
Is that like capoeira?

10:00.560 --> 10:02.480
You can have a free trial session,
if you want.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.440
Free? Now we're talking.

10:05.520 --> 10:09.800
Hello, all of you. My name is Arthur,
and together, we shall train Zumba.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.440
- Are you ready?
- [class] Yeah!

10:11.520 --> 10:12.960
[upbeat music playing over speakers]

10:13.040 --> 10:15.640
[Arthur]
Then we roll our hips, you guys!

10:15.720 --> 10:17.800
Sorry. I must have taken
a wrong turn somewhere.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.320
- I'm looking for Zumba.
- Yeah, this here is Zumba.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.080
I got the impression we were
talking more like martial art.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.960
What? No, come on.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.120
[Arthur]
Are you having fun?

10:31.200 --> 10:32.920
That's good!

10:34.760 --> 10:36.200
Hey, what is your name?

10:36.280 --> 10:40.000
- Roy.
- You are good.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.920
Hip, ass, hip, ass, hip, ass.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.080
Yes, good.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.800
And now arms. Yes.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.680
Look at Roy!
That's how it's done.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.640
You are so good.

10:58.720 --> 10:59.960
It's all those years riding a bike.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.760
Gotten used to dipping into turns.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.960
It's like oil for the hips.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.440
Yes? Why are you here?

11:18.520 --> 11:20.200
We talked to the guys
at the tattoo parlor.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.080
They said you went to pump some iron?

11:22.160 --> 11:25.440
Yeah, yeah.
Training is part of my rehab.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.680
It's been a lot of stress lately,
you know.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.960
- [in English] Stress.
- Yeah.

11:30.040 --> 11:33.120
I've been feeling stressful myself lately.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.080
Had to do with my last booze shipment,

11:35.160 --> 11:37.720
because it never showed up.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.920
[in Norwegian] Well, until I recover
from this slipped disc,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.720
I'm on full sick leave.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.040
[in English]
Are you losing your fucking mind?

11:45.120 --> 11:47.400
There's no Obamacare for bootleggers.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.240
- You deliver or you don't.
- Okay.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.960
[in Norwegian]
Okay, I'll make the delivery.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.280
But if it messes up my back,
you're paying for physio.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.280
[in English]
You got a deal.

12:01.360 --> 12:05.040
In fact, we'll throw in
a happy ending, huh?

12:05.120 --> 12:08.360
Just to put a smile back on that face.

12:08.440 --> 12:09.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.880
[Lars in Norwegian]
A hundred meters from the top,

12:15.960 --> 12:18.600
I take off my boot and my sock

12:18.680 --> 12:20.880
and look down at my toe.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.480
It is pitch-black.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.520
Gangrene.

12:26.600 --> 12:30.120
I pull out my knife, cut the toe off

12:30.200 --> 12:34.880
and put it behind a rock
at 8,740 height meters.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.440
That's how it was when I launched
my clothing line, as well.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.040
Things looked dark, but I never gave up.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.280
Never give up.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.120
NEVER GIVE UP!

12:49.200 --> 12:50.560
[Lars]
Any questions?

12:50.640 --> 12:52.520
- Yeah?
- [man] I was just wondering about

12:52.600 --> 12:54.800
the entrepreneurial grant you run
along with Innovation Norway.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.880
- [Lars] Mm-hm.
- How much money can one apply for?

12:57.960 --> 12:59.520
[Lars chuckles]

12:59.600 --> 13:02.200
You sure cut to the chase.
I like that.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.520
"What's the money in this?"

13:10.480 --> 13:13.240
- Fine lecture.
- Good. Thank you.

13:13.320 --> 13:17.400
- This looks pretty exciting.
- Yeah?

13:17.480 --> 13:21.840
Why haven't you applied?
Flamingo is the perfect case.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.160
I'll mail some info to your boss.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.600
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm. Good.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.200
Wanna grab a beer at the bar?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.400
Talk about entrepreneurial stuff,

13:35.480 --> 13:38.440
both of us being entrepreneurs.

13:38.520 --> 13:41.600
Thanks, but, Torgeir,
I'm not exactly the beer-drinking kind.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.880
Oh, no. I am not really
a beer guy either.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.080
We'll see each other
at that lutefisk dinner anyway.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.040
Yes, we will. Looking forward to it.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.720
- You know what? So am I.
- Yeah.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.480
You sure you don't want a beer, though?

13:55.560 --> 13:57.480
My treat.

13:57.560 --> 13:58.960
Hey, you have learned something today.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.120
Never give up.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.000
Go out into this world.
Go get them.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.280
Yes, I will. Yes.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.880
- Reach for the top.
- Yes.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.520
[TV playing indistinctly]

14:20.880 --> 14:22.240
[groans]

14:37.440 --> 14:39.120
[Torgeir]
A beer for me.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.600
Got a snuff for me, as well?

14:58.680 --> 15:00.400
I only got loose.

15:00.480 --> 15:03.960
So? I don't eat candy with the wrapper on.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.480
Be careful so you don't swallow it,
it makes your stomach run.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.280
Hmm.
Do you pull a lot of chicks

15:25.360 --> 15:26.960
talking about your bowel movements?

15:59.480 --> 16:02.840
[The Woggles' "Big Beat Strong" playing]

16:25.920 --> 16:27.120
[sighs]

16:27.200 --> 16:29.080
Thank you.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.240
Feels damn good
to get back up on that horse.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.400
Did you just call me a horse?

16:35.480 --> 16:38.320
Aw, no. Just metaphorically.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.480
I've been struggling with a mental block

16:40.560 --> 16:42.360
when dealing with the ladies, you see.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.080
Jeez, did you rob a bank or what?

16:53.800 --> 16:55.640
I won a game of poker.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.760
I'm the kind of guy
who knows how to read people.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.440
But I guess you already noticed.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.240
Mm-hmm.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.280
And where does this card game go down?

17:04.360 --> 17:07.240
Down at the club I manage,
the Flamingo.

17:07.320 --> 17:10.520
I'd love to invite you,

17:10.600 --> 17:12.760
but it's sort of a guy thing.

17:12.840 --> 17:14.560
Mm-hmm.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.720
I see.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.520
Good night.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.280
Good night.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.400
You like to spoon?

17:34.480 --> 17:35.960
No.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.520
Oh.

17:51.920 --> 17:57.680
Today, I'm dressed as one of the most
beautiful things in nature: a sperm cell.

17:58.960 --> 18:05.280
That is because sperm is
still taboo in many cultures.

18:05.360 --> 18:09.440
It is to remove the taboo.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.440
Just push it away.

18:14.080 --> 18:18.520
We have a big problem in this community.

18:18.600 --> 18:22.640
We have far too few sperm donors
with non-western backgrounds.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.080
This is Ali from NRK Oppland.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.600
It was he who first made me
aware of this problem. Ali?

18:28.680 --> 18:30.720
Yes. My wife and I have

18:30.800 --> 18:32.760
for several years tried conceiving,
without any luck.

18:32.840 --> 18:36.880
We went there to the fertility clinic,

18:36.960 --> 18:39.640
intending to make a sunshine story
about artificial insemination.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.800
But it didn't turn out a sunshine story,
did it, Ali?

18:43.280 --> 18:45.800
No.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.120
They had no biological material
of my kind.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.640
[in English]
Yo, what is he talking about?

18:49.720 --> 18:52.240
- His boys, they can't swim.
- Oh. [chuckles]

18:52.320 --> 18:54.320
[shushing]

18:54.400 --> 18:58.000
[in Norwegian] I know this might be
awkward for you.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.680
But we're in Norway now.

18:59.760 --> 19:04.960
Here, those who have plenty
share with those who have little,

19:05.040 --> 19:06.520
even when it comes to sperm.

19:06.600 --> 19:10.840
All that remains is signing up with Siri,
the nice girl over there. Hi, Siri.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.400
- [Siri] Hello.
- [Jan] Yes, Siri is her name.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.240
Not everyone has adjusted to the Norwegian
way of thinking, like you have.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.880
- Hey, Jan.
- Yes?

19:26.960 --> 19:29.320
- When do I get my room?
- Room?

19:29.400 --> 19:33.960
Yes. It says that the winner
gets a single room.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.680
And I have used
all of my calling card on this.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.360
This is something
we can talk about later. Yes.

19:42.720 --> 19:46.600
"The chairman of the Flamingo group
is nominated for the Flame Award."

19:46.680 --> 19:49.360
Have you cheated with the voting?

19:51.760 --> 19:55.920
Remember, you're visiting
as a private person, not a reporter.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.560
[laughs]

20:03.160 --> 20:04.920
[sighs]

20:05.000 --> 20:06.720
[elevator dings]

20:21.640 --> 20:23.080
Hello?

20:27.240 --> 20:28.640
Hello?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.400
[mutters]

20:35.480 --> 20:37.480
[machine whirring]

20:37.560 --> 20:39.680
[in English]
Where's your brother?

20:39.760 --> 20:42.840
[in Norwegian] I don't fucking know.
We were having tacos yesterday,

20:42.920 --> 20:46.360
but he didn't show.
I had to eat the whole thing myself.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.880
[in English]
Hello, boys.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.640
[Johnny] Look who finally showed up.
Where were you last night?

20:56.720 --> 20:59.240
[in Norwegian] I guess you can say
I was held up.

20:59.320 --> 21:02.920
I know that grin.
Did you score last night?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.160
[in English]
"A gentleman never tells."

21:05.240 --> 21:06.680
[in Norwegian]
Ain't that how the saying goes?

21:06.760 --> 21:09.200
Congratulations, Torgeir.
Who's the lucky guy?

21:09.280 --> 21:11.360
[all laugh]

21:11.440 --> 21:13.480
[Torgeir]
She was actually a real piece.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.040
She asked me for a snuff,
and before you knew it,

21:16.120 --> 21:18.160
we were banging like bunnies.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.400
[laughing]

21:21.480 --> 21:23.280
I gave her a hickie!

21:23.360 --> 21:25.600
Hickie? What is this, junior high?

21:25.680 --> 21:28.080
[in English]
I've heard enough. Let's play cards.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.680
[R&B playing over speakers]

21:31.760 --> 21:35.200
- I'll check.
- [in Norwegian] Sixty higher.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.680
[in English] What do you got,
you sneaky fuck?

21:37.760 --> 21:39.560
[in Norwegian] By the way,
I have the pleasure of informing you

21:39.640 --> 21:41.600
- the delivery is coming tomorrow.
- [in English] That's good.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.520
[in Norwegian] Just let me know
if you need any help carrying.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.400
That's all right.
I've been at the gym...

21:46.480 --> 21:48.360
[in English]
Pumping some iron.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.000
Oh, we've seen what you've
been pumping down there.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.840
Those hips don't lie, Shakira.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.640
[all laugh]

21:54.720 --> 21:56.440
[in Norwegian] We saw your dancing
through the window.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.680
- [Roy] Yeah, yeah, whatever!
- [in English] I'm in.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.000
[in Norwegian]
Just forget it.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.000
[Roy laughing]

22:13.080 --> 22:15.760
[in English] Does this look like a guy
who needs Obamacare?

22:15.840 --> 22:17.240
[banging on door]

22:17.320 --> 22:18.760
[Johnny in English]
What the fuck is that?

22:18.840 --> 22:20.600
[in Norwegian]
Armed police!

22:21.800 --> 22:23.800
So we are busy at illegal gambling.

22:23.880 --> 22:27.160
Keep still.
Let me see your hands.

22:27.240 --> 22:30.040
[in English] Come on, officers.
Just some friends passing the time.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.280
[in Norwegian]
The money!

22:32.360 --> 22:35.040
Hey. You can't do that.
That's my private money.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.080
Ah, fuck!

22:37.160 --> 22:40.240
Anyone else who feels inclined
to obstruct the police?

22:40.320 --> 22:45.160
Okay, good.
There will be fines for everyone.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.960
I have a prolapsed disc!

22:47.040 --> 22:48.640
[Mette] And this idiot goes with me
to the station.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.840
[Roy]
Shit!

22:51.920 --> 22:53.800
[door slams]

22:54.920 --> 22:58.120
[in English] You know,
I prefer the old chief of police.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.720
[Torgeir]
Yeah.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.960
She's a very complicated woman, this one.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.040
[Johnny]
What, you know her?

23:06.120 --> 23:07.440
No.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.640
[in Norwegian] You can't keep me here
just because of a game of cards.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.120
I can't?

23:36.840 --> 23:39.720
You have a painkiller?
My back is fucked.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.320
Those are my birth control pills.

23:56.720 --> 24:00.040
[retching]

24:00.120 --> 24:01.480
Fuck.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.040
[coughs]

24:06.640 --> 24:09.800
Can you tell me a little about
your connection to Flamingo?

24:09.880 --> 24:14.600
Ain't no connection.
Just a satisfied customer.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.240
I see.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.520
Is that a hickie on your neck?

24:23.200 --> 24:24.880
[sighs]

24:26.480 --> 24:28.600
And you are using snuff.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.680
I'm the one asking
the questions here. Got that?

24:38.160 --> 24:40.840
[Johnny in English]
What? That's ridiculous.

24:40.920 --> 24:43.280
[Lars in Norwegian]  Yes, it's just
that we don't appreciate noise

24:43.360 --> 24:45.240
in the media very much.
See what I mean.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.680
[in English] Don't worry about a thing.
I'll take care of it.

24:47.760 --> 24:52.400
All you've got to worry about is what
to wear to your big dinner, all right?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.840
[in Norwegian] Can't have the tables
like this on Saturday.

24:54.920 --> 24:58.160
Olafsen is into feng shui,
so the tables need to be in harmony.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.720
What did you say?

24:59.800 --> 25:02.760
Yeah, like Chinese furniture wisdom.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.360
[Arne]
Let's move the tables then.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.680
- [in English] How's it going?
- [Torgeir] Good, good.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.880
[Johnny] Listen,
that Lars Olafsen guy called me.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.280
He mentioned something about a reporter

25:11.360 --> 25:14.280
saying the Flame Award was rigged.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.000
You heard anything about that?

25:18.960 --> 25:21.360
Spit it out.

25:21.440 --> 25:25.680
You know, you talked about how important
the prize was to win, so we...

25:25.760 --> 25:27.680
[in Norwegian]
Talked to these refugee-people

25:27.760 --> 25:30.760
and made them call in and vote some.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.800
[in English]
Oh, fuck.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.160
I'm the Lance Armstrong
of business awards.

25:36.240 --> 25:40.440
He, uh, mentioned a reporter's name,
Ali from the NRK.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.960
- Anybody know him?
- [in Norwegian] Yes, I know him.

25:43.040 --> 25:47.160
[in English] So, what kind of guy is he?
Got any dirt on him or what?

25:47.240 --> 25:49.840
[in Norwegian] No.
Straightest immigrant in all of Oppland.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.200
[in English]
Gotta be a way of getting to him.

25:52.280 --> 25:56.400
You know?
Everybody needs something.

25:56.480 --> 26:00.520
[in Norwegian]
Well, just off the top of my head,

26:00.600 --> 26:03.200
there is only one thing I know about.

26:06.280 --> 26:09.800
- That took a while. Ha-ha!
- [Hassan] Shut up.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.760
- Hi.
- Thank you.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.720
You need to get magazines
with some younger ladies.

26:19.800 --> 26:23.600
And now your family reunion
application will be reevaluated.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.600
You are not a good man.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.480
Hi.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.320
Thank you.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.400
Mother nature needs
a little push now and then.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.040
Oh, hello.
Back on the street?

26:45.120 --> 26:47.640
Sure. And you're out shopping, I see.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.560
We needed back-up,
in case they were gonna keep you for long.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.800
Right.
Funny how the sheriff knew

26:53.880 --> 26:58.120
all about the poker game,
don't you think?

26:59.960 --> 27:03.080
Yes. Really weird.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.880
You know what I think?

27:06.960 --> 27:09.760
I think someone slept with her,

27:09.840 --> 27:12.240
a schmuck who hasn't
dipped his dick in a while,

27:12.320 --> 27:15.280
and then he got so pussy-whipped
that he started blabbing

27:15.360 --> 27:16.760
about things he shouldn't have.

27:16.840 --> 27:20.480
- Stop it. Calm down.
- Oh, yeah?

27:20.560 --> 27:22.840
Look, I didn't know she worked
for the police. If she--

27:22.920 --> 27:25.280
[groaning]

27:26.960 --> 27:29.400
[Torgeir and Roy grunting]

27:45.160 --> 27:49.520
- Open the door! Open it! Come on!
- Cocksucker!

27:49.600 --> 27:53.120
- Don't even try to drive away!
- Blame yourself.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.200
[tires screeching]

27:56.880 --> 27:58.560
[screams]

27:58.640 --> 28:00.600
[horn honks]

28:00.680 --> 28:02.280
[in English]
We gotta go, boss.

28:02.360 --> 28:06.480
- What the fuck is his problem?
- I don't know.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.360
[in Norwegian] Guess he was pissed
we went shopping at the liquor outlet.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.680
That pain medication must be
really screwing up his head, huh?

28:18.760 --> 28:21.040
[groaning]

28:40.840 --> 28:44.120
[lively chattering]

28:44.200 --> 28:47.440
[cheering, whistling]

28:47.520 --> 28:49.080
[Johnny laughs]

28:49.160 --> 28:52.800
- "Luuters." I love it!
- That's our thing, you know,

28:52.880 --> 28:55.160
combining American
and Norwegian culture.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.120
That's what it's all about.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.880
[indistinct chattering]

29:01.240 --> 29:02.800
Hey...

29:02.880 --> 29:04.640
It's a joke, huh?

29:04.720 --> 29:06.120
What?

29:06.200 --> 29:09.160
This is not lutefisk.
It...

29:09.240 --> 29:11.200
It's a joke.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.800
[in Norwegian]
It looks more like rakfisk.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.720
[laughing]

29:14.800 --> 29:18.120
[chuckles nervously]

29:18.200 --> 29:21.000
[in English]
What the fuck is going on here?

29:21.080 --> 29:24.040
El Toro  told me to make
that smelly Norwegian fish.

29:24.120 --> 29:27.040
- And that's what I did.
- I meant the other one.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.160
He's from Africa, you huckleberry.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.320
How does he know you got
more than one kind of smelly fish?

29:31.400 --> 29:33.320
- I'm sorry, I was--
- We got no time for excuses.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.320
Oh, my friend.
I'm so sorry.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.880
This is obviously a major fuck-up,
and, uh...

29:38.960 --> 29:41.440
Well, dinner is on me.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.920
[in Norwegian] You know what, guys?
What we do now

29:44.000 --> 29:48.440
is turn this around, and say,
"Welcome to a rakfisk-gathering."

29:48.520 --> 29:49.840
[chuckles]

29:49.920 --> 29:52.280
[in English]
Why not?

29:52.360 --> 29:54.760
[all chuckling]

30:07.160 --> 30:10.080
[in English]
"You are an important person.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.400
Other people like you.

30:14.960 --> 30:18.800
Yeah. You can do it."

30:23.720 --> 30:26.640
[in Norwegian]
So, Johnny, we received your application

30:26.720 --> 30:29.080
for a grant from the Gazelle Fund.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.240
It would be interesting to hear
more about how you run things.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.400
I'm glad you asked about that.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.080
[Alf]
PowerPoint?

30:36.160 --> 30:39.160
Check out Gordon Gecko.
Briefcase and all.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.120
[in English]
What's wrong?

30:42.200 --> 30:44.480
[in Norwegian]
I've blacked out completely on the code.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.320
[Johnny in English]
Use this.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.240
[in Norwegian]
It was kind of expensive, but...

30:49.320 --> 30:50.760
- [in English] Just use it.
- Okay.

30:58.040 --> 31:02.800
[in Norwegian] Why is Flamingo a company
the Gazelle Fund should support?

31:04.280 --> 31:06.080
Five key words:

31:06.160 --> 31:09.000
We are innovative.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.760
We are...

31:14.160 --> 31:16.760
...innovative.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.200
We are...

31:19.520 --> 31:21.800
We are in--

31:21.880 --> 31:24.080
I've already said "innovative." But...

31:26.960 --> 31:29.440
[snickering]

31:29.520 --> 31:32.160
You're innovative as hell,
at least we get that much.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.080
[laughter]

31:34.160 --> 31:37.640
[in English] Well, it's obvious
we don't know shit about PowerPoint,

31:37.720 --> 31:40.280
but, uh, we sure as hell know
how to party.

31:40.360 --> 31:43.280
Girls, bring on the booze.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.040
[applause, appreciative whistles]

31:46.120 --> 31:48.880
[dance music playing over speaker]

31:54.080 --> 31:55.880
[lively chattering]

31:59.440 --> 32:01.680
- Johnny.
- Hey, boys.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.520
We've been talking a little bit.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.080
And, uh, Alf has something
he wants to tell you.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.000
Oh, yeah?

32:08.080 --> 32:12.000
[in Norwegian] The fund would like
to invest a few million in your club.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.360
[in English]
We want to invest.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.960
[in English]
Wow.

32:17.040 --> 32:21.520
Dare I ask... how we came
to that conclusion after today's events?

32:21.600 --> 32:25.320
[in Norwegian]
There's one reason. You.

32:25.400 --> 32:28.040
Hmm.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.120
- Have you heard of Kurt Nilsen?
- [in English] No.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.600
[in Norwegian]
The Norwegian who won  World Idol.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.480
You're kind of like him.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.880
He's a plumber.
He's not very good-looking--

32:38.960 --> 32:40.600
[in English]
I'm not sure I like where this is going.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.480
[in Norwegian]
No, no, not like that.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.280
The point is
that the odds are against him.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.680
But he's got that magic touch.
You're also like that.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.200
Hmm.

32:50.280 --> 32:53.320
[in English] Let's drink to plumbers
with the magic touch.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.120
[chuckles]

32:58.920 --> 33:02.000
[in Norwegian]
But there is one thing.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.480
Your managing director.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.800
[in English]
Very loyal.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.880
[in Norwegian]
I understand you love him.

33:13.960 --> 33:16.040
I loved my toe, too.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.440
[in English]
He's your black-toe man.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.880
[in English]
Have a seat.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.400
I don't know what the hell happened.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.640
[in Norwegian]
I took a PowerPoint course at NAV.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.360
[in English]
I really learned my homework, you know?

33:44.440 --> 33:47.320
- We got the grant.
- [sighs]

33:47.400 --> 33:50.080
[in English]
That's a relief.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.600
But it means we've got to make
some changes around here.

33:52.680 --> 33:55.600
Definitely.

33:55.680 --> 33:58.640
- Like what?
- We're gonna need a new CEO.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.480
Who's gonna work together
with me, right?

34:08.840 --> 34:10.400
Not exactly.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.760
Are you firing me?

34:18.840 --> 34:21.000
Of course not.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.160
You're essential to this place.

34:23.240 --> 34:28.960
We just need to find a new position
that's better suited to your talents.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.800
Yeah.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.880
It's the way it's gotta be.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.400
Whatever you say, boss.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.560
[men chattering in Norwegian]

34:39.640 --> 34:42.160
[bartender in English]
Orders.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.520
[in Norwegian]
Bye.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.240
We're going for the top here.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.640
That's it.  Chomolungma , right?

34:59.720 --> 35:01.720
There is no stress for guys
like you reaching the top.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.720
You have people to carry
your stuff for you.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.800
But we who have to carry our own stuff,
we don't get by that easy.

35:26.680 --> 35:30.240
[Lars] Welcome to the kick-off,
for you employees at Flamingo.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.680
The idea is that Martin takes over as CEO.

35:32.760 --> 35:37.240
So all I'll say is, "Go, Martin."

35:37.320 --> 35:39.000
Flamingo.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.440
Is it a cool club in Lillehammer?

35:42.520 --> 35:45.360
A very cool club at Lillehammer.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.000
[Martin]
I'll bet.

35:47.080 --> 35:50.160
But my job is to improve.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.400
[in English]
If it ain't broke, fix it anyway.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.880
[in Norwegian]
Take the logo. Pink?

35:57.960 --> 35:59.920
Flamingoes are pink.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.680
Yes.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.440
But is that what we aim to communicate?

36:04.520 --> 36:07.240
It is not very Norwegian,
and no local connections.

36:07.320 --> 36:09.360
I think we could get a great
boost by changing the name.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.280
I believe Johnny is very happy
with the name as it is.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.520
All good. But now we are
in the "yes" phase.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.880
Yes.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.280
This is my vision.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.000
[snickers]

36:20.080 --> 36:22.560
An owl! That is our new logo!

36:22.640 --> 36:24.120
It's the most stupid thing I've seen.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.320
It is a sketch.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.480
- [laughter]
- "Ugly" is my word for it.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.880
It is a predator that chases
in the night, and...

36:31.960 --> 36:34.080
- It knows what it wants--
- [Lars] Fine, Martin, fine.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.120
Listen, boys, what we are doing now

36:36.200 --> 36:38.640
- is throwing ideas up in the air.
- They don't land very well.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.200
All the best!

36:50.640 --> 36:54.440
[Lars] Here we have the leisure nirvana
of Scandinavia.

36:54.520 --> 36:55.760
- Okay.
- Get it?

36:55.840 --> 36:57.920
And away with this whole area.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.280
It is incredibly tacky.
And then we'll put the catwalk here.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.080
Hi. I was led to understand by Lars

37:16.160 --> 37:19.360
that our cooperation
got off a bit on the wrong foot.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.080
[in English] I guess sometimes
it's a challenge

37:23.160 --> 37:25.360
for new guys to find their place,
you know.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.600
[in Norwegian] Yes. We agreed on a run
tomorrow morning. Would you like to join?

37:28.680 --> 37:29.960
[in English]
Blow off some steam?

37:30.040 --> 37:32.560
- Jogging?
- Yeah.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.960
I only run when people
are chasing me with guns.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.520
[laughs]

37:37.600 --> 37:39.600
[in Norwegian]
You're a funny guy.

37:39.680 --> 37:43.080
[in English]
What? Who's funny? I'm funny?

37:44.800 --> 37:47.520
[in English]
Yeah, you're a funny guy.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.720
Funny how?

37:49.800 --> 37:52.200
What, do I amuse you?

37:52.280 --> 37:54.280
[in Norwegian]
I meant more like...

37:54.360 --> 37:55.760
[in English]
What?

37:55.840 --> 37:58.200
[in Norwegian]
I meant... I didn't mean to--

37:58.280 --> 38:00.240
[in English]
I'm just fucking with you.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.880
Okay.

38:01.960 --> 38:05.240
I was doing Tommy DeVito, you know.

38:05.320 --> 38:09.040
[in Norwegian]
Danny, that is his name.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.600
- [in English] Short, funny.
- No, no, no.

38:12.680 --> 38:16.040
Tommy DeVito,
Joe Pesci's character in  Goodfellas.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.720
[in Norwegian]
Is that a musical?

38:18.800 --> 38:21.200
[chuckles]

38:21.280 --> 38:24.960
[in English] Now you're fucking with me.
That's good.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.520
You're not?  Goodfellas.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.800
Scorsese? One of the greatest
fucking movies ever made?

38:31.880 --> 38:34.840
[in Norwegian] Oh, yes.
Well, I don't watch too many movies.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.240
I'm more of a television guy.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.000
Have you seen  Two and a Half Men?

38:38.080 --> 38:41.760
You must, you will love it.
My God, those guys are so funny.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.160
That series is awesome.
Danny DeVito is also funny, but--

38:44.240 --> 38:46.200
[in English]
Lars around?

38:46.280 --> 38:48.560
[in English]
Yeah, yeah, he's in our office.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.880
I think you mean he's in my office.

39:02.120 --> 39:05.320
[Lars in Norwegian] Hey, Johnny.
We have great plans here.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.840
[in English]
What's this?

39:10.920 --> 39:13.360
Well, boys, this deal
just ain't working out,

39:13.440 --> 39:15.600
so this is our divorce papers.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.000
Divorce...?

39:17.080 --> 39:19.040
No, no, Johnny, I love this deal.

39:19.120 --> 39:22.200
I see no reason at all to sign this paper.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.960
[Johnny] Remember that mountain climbing
story you told, you know,

39:25.040 --> 39:28.480
- about your favorite toe?
- [Lars] Yeah.

39:28.560 --> 39:32.400
Well, Oddjob has nine good reasons for
you to sign that fucking piece of paper.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.720
[clacking]

39:43.320 --> 39:45.120
[door opens]

39:46.920 --> 39:49.160
[TV playing indistinctly]

39:57.360 --> 39:59.920
- Your brother let me in.
- Oh, yeah?

40:01.680 --> 40:05.640
Look, listening to that Lars guy
was a mistake.

40:07.400 --> 40:11.720
I turned the grant down.
Told him to go fuck himself.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.520
[in Norwegian]
Then what happens with the new CEO?

40:13.600 --> 40:16.920
[in English]
That's why I'm here. I want you back.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.120
[in English] Ah. I don't know.

40:25.800 --> 40:28.440
I got Italian blood.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.320
Sometimes I get a little...

40:31.400 --> 40:33.360
...overenthusiastic.

40:34.960 --> 40:39.040
We started that club together,

40:39.120 --> 40:41.840
and I'm gonna keep it that way.

40:41.920 --> 40:43.640
You gonna make me beg?

40:45.760 --> 40:47.160
No.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.400
To tell you the truth,

40:51.480 --> 40:53.320
I really want the job back.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.480
It's the best job
I've ever had in my life.

40:55.560 --> 40:58.480
[chuckles] Right.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.640
What other jobs have you had?

41:02.440 --> 41:04.720
I'm fucking with you.
Welcome back.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.840
You dirty rat.
You nearly got me.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.520
This far.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.920
So, what are we watching?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.920
Goodfellas  starts after this.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.800
Oh, yeah? What was the name
of Joe Pesci's character again?

41:17.880 --> 41:20.360
Tommy DeVito.
Best role in his life.

41:20.440 --> 41:22.280
That's my partner.

41:26.560 --> 41:32.080
[in Norwegian] There is one thing...
I need to tell you.

41:32.280 --> 41:35.640
[in English]
You know the lady I, uh, banged?

41:37.080 --> 41:39.520
It was the sheriff.

41:39.600 --> 41:43.200
- Fuck.
- But you gotta believe me, I didn't know.

41:43.320 --> 41:46.600
If she was a cop, I would never have
anything to do with her.

41:46.680 --> 41:49.360
[in Norwegian] I only thought
she was interested in cards--

41:49.440 --> 41:51.360
[in English]
Do me a favor.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.360
- Stop talking.
- Yeah.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.480
You're making me regret
taking you back already.

41:55.560 --> 41:57.960
I'll stop talking right away.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.880
[sighs]

42:01.240 --> 42:04.080
[Bing Bang's "Epic Scrap Metal" playing]

42:36.360 --> 42:38.280
[Johnny]
Sorry, pal, we're closed.

42:38.360 --> 42:41.640
- Good. Then we can talk.
- [chuckles]

42:41.720 --> 42:44.720
I smell a cop.
Tell me I'm wrong.

42:44.800 --> 42:48.640
PST, actually,
the Norwegian Homeland Security.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.120
Our happy hour's been
a little crazy lately,

42:52.200 --> 42:54.960
but I didn't think we were
a national security threat.

42:55.040 --> 42:58.680
This isn't about your club.
Can we talk in private?

43:00.720 --> 43:04.040
Eight days ago,
a bank vault was robbed in Oslo.

43:04.120 --> 43:07.800
The press is calling it
the "Bieber Bank Heist."

43:07.880 --> 43:09.680
I tell you what.

43:09.760 --> 43:13.600
When guys start pulling heists
wearing Tony Bennett masks,

43:13.680 --> 43:15.440
you come see me.

43:17.800 --> 43:21.040
You're not a suspect.
The fact is that

43:21.120 --> 43:23.560
one of the bank boxes that got robbed, uh,

43:23.640 --> 43:28.000
contained some, uh, sensitive information.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.960
And I need your help to get it back.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.120
Well, sorry, pal.
But unless you need catering,

43:33.200 --> 43:34.920
there's nothing I can do for you.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.120
Some of the information
that got lost is, uh...
